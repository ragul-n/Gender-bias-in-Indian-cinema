1
00:01:51,042 --> 00:01:53,125
<i>It's a joyous day for me,</i>

2
00:01:53,333 --> 00:01:56,500
<i>because my autobiography,</i>

3
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,500
<i>is being released.</i>

4
00:01:59,208 --> 00:02:02,667
I'm a very misunderstood man.

5
00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:06,917
If you want to know the real Sanjay Dutt,

6
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:08,542
read my autobiography.

7
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:12,667
It's my story,
but written by my buddy, D. N. Tripathi.

8
00:02:12,917 --> 00:02:15,500
And he wishes that I read you a chapter.

9
00:02:19,708 --> 00:02:21,208
"Chapter one...

10
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:22,875
Bapu and Sanju.

11
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:26,167
Bapu is Mahatma Gandhi.

12
00:02:26,458 --> 00:02:28,583
And, Sanju... Yours truly, Sanjay Dutt.

13
00:02:28,667 --> 00:02:32,708
Our lives have followed
quite a similar graph."

14
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:37,750
- Hey, Tripathi...
- Yes.

15
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:40,917
Killer opening! Moved me to tears.

16
00:02:41,083 --> 00:02:44,000
Your wish is my command.
I've put my soul into it.

17
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:46,625
Mohammed... Sudama... come here.

18
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,833
Tripathi has written a rump-ripping book.

19
00:02:50,292 --> 00:02:52,917
Read us a chapter. Nanny, take a seat.

20
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:57,417
The book is titled "Sage Sanju".

21
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,000
"Chapter one...

22
00:02:59,167 --> 00:03:01,375
Bapu and Sanju.

23
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:04,125
Bapu is Mahatma Gandhi.

24
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:06,500
And, Sanju... Yours truly, Sanjay Dutt.

25
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:10,250
Our lives have followed
quite a similar graph.

26
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:13,917
For instance, we've both spent
a lot of time in prison.

27
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:16,542
He's a national hero.

28
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:19,292
I'm a Bollywood hero.

29
00:03:19,917 --> 00:03:21,292
He was against violence.

30
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:25,292
He walked with a stick
but never used it as a weapon

31
00:03:25,542 --> 00:03:29,958
I had an AK-56 rifle
and never used it either.

32
00:03:30,667 --> 00:03:32,375
He dreamed of a free India.

33
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:36,250
I dream of... my freedom."

34
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:39,042
Maanyata, it's a slow starter.

35
00:03:39,542 --> 00:03:42,583
Don't worry, the story picks up later.

36
00:03:49,292 --> 00:03:50,417
Hold this...

37
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:53,000
pick up the bell... ring it.

38
00:03:53,667 --> 00:03:56,125
Go around and worship me.

39
00:03:56,208 --> 00:04:00,375
You've elevated me to Mahatma Gandhi
in the first chapter.

40
00:04:00,458 --> 00:04:02,500
By the end, you'll turn me into god!

41
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:05,708
Find a temple for sale.

42
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:07,833
He'll put me on the altar.

43
00:04:07,917 --> 00:04:09,292
Sorry, Tripathi.

44
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:12,625
Buddy, tell me...

45
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:16,500
are shoes allowed inside a temple?

46
00:04:17,792 --> 00:04:19,042
Not at all, Sanju.

47
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:21,875
Then how dare you wear shoes
in front of God?

48
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:29,000
Sanju, I'd told you, I'm no biographer.

49
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:30,792
I'm a songwriter...

50
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:33,667
Sanju... please!

51
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:43,583
What about me reminds you of Gandhi?

52
00:04:44,167 --> 00:04:45,417
I'll write another draft.

53
00:04:46,542 --> 00:04:49,167
<i>Shithead, you jacked my book!</i>

54
00:04:49,792 --> 00:04:53,042
<i>Our correspondent is outside
the Supreme Court.</i>

55
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:57,208
<i>In moments, we'll know
whether the actor, Sanjay Dutt,</i>

56
00:04:57,292 --> 00:04:59,500
<i>will go to prison or be free.</i>

57
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:04,333
<i>In 2006, the Anti-Terrorism Court
had sentenced Sanjay Dutt</i>

58
00:05:04,417 --> 00:05:07,583
<i>to six years imprisonment
in the Mumbai bomb blast case.</i>

59
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,458
<i>He'd appealed to the Supreme Court
against the judgment.</i>

60
00:05:11,667 --> 00:05:16,042
<i>The judgment was expected next week.</i>

61
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:18,542
<i>But we've just received information</i>

62
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:21,583
<i>the Supreme Court
will give its verdict today.</i>

63
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:25,583
<i>Stay tuned, as we report live
from the Supreme Court.</i>

64
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,292
<i>Dinesh, give us an update.</i>

65
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:32,208
<i>The verdict is out.
Sanjay Dutt will go to prison.</i>

66
00:05:32,292 --> 00:05:35,042
<i>The Court has sentenced him to five years,</i>

67
00:05:35,167 --> 00:05:37,917
<i>for possession of an AK-56 rifle.</i>

68
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,958
<i>When does he go to prison?</i>

69
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:44,000
<i>The Court has given him
a month to surrender</i>

70
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:48,333
<i>so he can complete his films.</i>

71
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:51,417
<i>His father, late Sunil Dutt,
popular actor and politician...</i>

72
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:56,000
<i>his mother, late Nargis,
iconic actor of the '60s...</i>

73
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:59,667
<i>the scion of this eminent family,
Sanjay, will go to prison.</i>

74
00:06:00,167 --> 00:06:02,542
<i>Let's hear what people have to say.</i>

75
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:06,625
<i>Five years is nothing.
He should be hanged!</i>

76
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:09,125
<i>Traitor... a bloody terrorist!</i>

77
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:11,417
<i>Celebrities have it easy.</i>

78
00:06:11,792 --> 00:06:14,000
<i>Such terrorists should be shot dead!</i>

79
00:06:27,542 --> 00:06:29,375
Come inside.

80
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:44,500
<i>When the kids start school,</i>

81
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:47,500
<i>they are sure to be asked...</i>

82
00:06:48,167 --> 00:06:52,625
<i>"Where's your terrorist-dad? In prison?"</i>

83
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:57,542
<i>It'll be easier for them to say,
"No, he's dead."</i>

84
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:14,167
<i>Sanju!</i>

85
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:17,542
Suicide may solve your problem,

86
00:07:17,667 --> 00:07:18,875
not your kids'.

87
00:07:21,292 --> 00:07:23,542
They'll still be called terrorist's kids.

88
00:07:29,042 --> 00:07:32,208
We decided to fight, didn't we?

89
00:07:32,917 --> 00:07:36,125
- That we'll get the truth out there.
- Didn't we try?

90
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:39,500
What did we get? Bapu and Sanju!

91
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:42,542
That's what you get with knuckleheads.

92
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:43,750
Write it yourself.

93
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:46,750
Struggled with a four-line suicide note.

94
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:48,708
Imagine a 400-page book!

95
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:50,167
We'll find a good writer.

96
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:52,625
Why will they be interested?

97
00:07:52,708 --> 00:07:55,750
It's said,
"Bad choices make good stories."

98
00:07:57,042 --> 00:07:59,750
And you're the king of bad choices.

99
00:08:00,792 --> 00:08:03,083
Some writer out there
will understand this.

100
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:19,125
Sanju, be respectful.

101
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:21,333
<i>She's no Tripathi. She's Winnie Diaz.</i>

102
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:23,292
<i>World's top biographer.</i>

103
00:08:24,167 --> 00:08:25,458
<i>She's down from London.</i>

104
00:08:25,542 --> 00:08:28,500
Control slang like...
rump-ripper, jacked...

105
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:30,208
Got it.

106
00:08:44,417 --> 00:08:45,292
Winnie

107
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,042
I won't take much of your time.

108
00:08:48,167 --> 00:08:51,458
- I wanted--
- I can't write your biography. I'm sorry.

109
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:53,042
Why not?

110
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:59,917
...I asked around and...

111
00:09:00,917 --> 00:09:03,667
And they said I'm a terrorist.

112
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,208
Who are these people? Do they know me?

113
00:09:12,417 --> 00:09:15,875
Do they hang out with me?

114
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:18,333
Then how can they be so sure?

115
00:09:18,917 --> 00:09:23,083
Their opinion is based
merely on TV and print news.

116
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:26,375
And these TV anchors, newspaper reporters,

117
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:28,458
who dish out opinions every day,

118
00:09:28,542 --> 00:09:30,583
haven't met me either!

119
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:34,500
The media has maligned me.

120
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:38,792
So, I need a good writer
to present my side of the story.

121
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:44,542
You think millions
will read your biography?

122
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,875
It doesn't work like that.

123
00:09:47,042 --> 00:09:51,625
Thousands of books
rot away in book stores.

124
00:09:52,042 --> 00:09:54,333
Once in a blue moon a book comes that--

125
00:09:54,417 --> 00:09:56,875
That's a rump-ripper!

126
00:09:57,042 --> 00:10:00,000
My story's that!

127
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:01,917
What's there in your life story?

128
00:10:05,667 --> 00:10:09,625
Give me just one hour.
Guns, drugs, alcohol...

129
00:10:09,792 --> 00:10:12,417
Pick any chapter, I'll tell you the story.

130
00:10:12,667 --> 00:10:14,958
I guarantee, you'll be jacked...

131
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:20,667
I mean... jack... it'll be a J K Rowling.

132
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:24,125
I have a month to surrender.

133
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,625
This time I may not survive.

134
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,667
One hour, please.

135
00:10:37,167 --> 00:10:39,875
5 p.m. tomorrow. Right here.

136
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:45,208
At 6 p.m., I'll tell you
if I'm jacked or not.

137
00:11:00,042 --> 00:11:03,500
From Amitabh Bachchan to Sachin Tendulkar

138
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:05,500
you've upset everyone.

139
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:11,917
So many heroes, but you'll pen
a terrorist's biography!

140
00:11:14,792 --> 00:11:16,083
This is fake news.

141
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:21,792
He too is a fake.
This is a pressure tactic.

142
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:23,542
- Who are you?
- Zubin Mistry.

143
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:27,708
I construct malls.

144
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:31,083
I suggest you don't write this book.

145
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:36,625
<i>And you came all the way to suggest it?</i>

146
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:41,250
I'm here daily to jog. Saw you here, so...

147
00:11:41,417 --> 00:11:44,583
Jog in a suit? Is work-wear shorts?

148
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:50,208
He hit me.

149
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:52,917
He's on cocaine, LSD, heroin...

150
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:58,667
A womanizer, too. Ask him his score.

151
00:11:58,792 --> 00:12:01,833
Any number less than 200, he's lying.

152
00:12:01,917 --> 00:12:05,833
Want to know his truth? Call me.

153
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:19,042
Sanju.

154
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:26,708
For once, I feel like thanking the press.

155
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:29,583
One headline, and you're here.

156
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:33,500
- Why did you get this printed?
- I didn't, Winnie.

157
00:12:33,917 --> 00:12:37,167
Reporters live outside my gate.
They follow me everywhere.

158
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:38,833
If you were a doctor,

159
00:12:38,917 --> 00:12:41,958
they'd print, "Sanju ill",
an actress... "Sanju's new lady."

160
00:12:42,042 --> 00:12:44,875
They want spicy headlines. Not the truth.

161
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:47,542
- That's why we've come to you.
- Will he tell me the truth?

162
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,750
Nothing but the truth. Fire away.

163
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:56,833
Excluding your wife,
how many women have you slept with?

164
00:12:58,417 --> 00:12:59,500
Look here.

165
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:08,667
Should I count the prostitutes or...

166
00:13:08,792 --> 00:13:10,708
No, let's keep them aside.

167
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:14,583
Never kept a score-card.

168
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:20,500
But once, I did the math,
I recalled around 308.

169
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:25,125
I must've missed a few.
On the safe side, let's say... 350.

170
00:13:32,792 --> 00:13:34,167
Do you know him?

171
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:39,000
Zubin! He was my friend.

172
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,583
I nicknamed him "God".

173
00:13:41,667 --> 00:13:44,792
Since you picked him,
let's start with chapter "God".

174
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:55,250
1981... my debut film.
He was always on the sets.

175
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:58,958
Dad was directing me
and I was nervous as hell.

176
00:13:59,292 --> 00:14:02,500
<i>Is this love?</i>

177
00:14:04,042 --> 00:14:06,542
<i>Yes, my dove!</i>

178
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:08,750
Cut...

179
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:12,292
Sonny, your lips are off sync.

180
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:15,542
Match them to the song.

181
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:21,958
And... a romantic reaction
when the girl sings.

182
00:14:22,042 --> 00:14:24,083
But, Dad, where's the girl?

183
00:14:24,167 --> 00:14:26,500
How do I react to a cold camera?

184
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:30,167
An actor's job is to imagine.

185
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:35,750
Imagine a beautiful actress
in front of you.

186
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:38,375
Ganpat, come here. Observe.

187
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:48,958
<i>Is this love?</i>

188
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,875
<i>Yes, my dove!</i>

189
00:14:55,083 --> 00:15:00,292
<i>In your absence
Day and night eclipse</i>

190
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:04,167
<i>And an hour is forever</i>

191
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,708
<i>Is this love?</i>

192
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:11,583
<i>Yes, my dove!</i>

193
00:15:13,167 --> 00:15:14,375
Cut.

194
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,708
Come. Give it a go.

195
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:21,292
Let's give him a heroine.

196
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:24,042
Ganpat, come here.

197
00:15:24,792 --> 00:15:27,958
Hold this and stand here.

198
00:15:28,292 --> 00:15:30,250
- Don't move.
- Good idea.

199
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:37,000
<i>Is this love?</i>

200
00:15:38,667 --> 00:15:40,875
<i>Yes, my dove!</i>

201
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:48,000
<i>In your absence
Day and night eclipse</i>

202
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:51,667
<i>And an hour is forever</i>

203
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:54,958
<i>Is this love?</i>

204
00:15:55,042 --> 00:15:56,458
<i>Yes!</i>

205
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:59,500
<i>Yes, my dove!</i>

206
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:01,167
Cut it!

207
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:05,458
Well played, Ramu. Ace!

208
00:16:06,417 --> 00:16:08,292
Sonny...

209
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:14,333
- You've been smoking?
- No, Dad.

210
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:18,875
Now you lie, too?

211
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:25,167
Thousands struggle to be an actor...
with no luck.

212
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:30,167
You've got it on a silver platter,
respect that.

213
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:34,458
Drinking, smoking...
will show on your face.

214
00:16:34,542 --> 00:16:36,708
The camera spares no one.

215
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:42,083
Quit smoking or I'll shelve the film.

216
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:02,625
Smoke with your left hand.
Fathers sniff the right hand.

217
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:17,333
Bro, I'm the first actor in the world
to romance a bandit.

218
00:17:17,458 --> 00:17:19,542
But, dad praised the cameraman.

219
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:21,583
"Well played, Ramu! Ace!"

220
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:24,917
However well I do, he never praises me.

221
00:17:25,542 --> 00:17:28,167
He insults me publicly.

222
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:33,500
- Reason with him.
- That would be suicide.

223
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:37,167
You're too scared of your dad.

224
00:17:37,417 --> 00:17:39,500
Hey, try this.

225
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:42,708
It bumps up confidence.

226
00:17:42,792 --> 00:17:47,167
Gladiators would take this before a fight.

227
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:54,417
Watch.

228
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,958
Put this in your nose... and snort it all.

229
00:18:00,167 --> 00:18:04,250
I make my Pomeranian snort it
and he thinks he's an Alsatian.

230
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:06,250
Try it.

231
00:18:08,792 --> 00:18:11,417
Hey! I've been taking it for years.

232
00:18:12,042 --> 00:18:14,958
I'm stronger than you. Try me.

233
00:18:32,292 --> 00:18:33,750
<i>O light of my soul!</i>

234
00:18:35,667 --> 00:18:40,708
<i>If you're heaven's king, I'm your queen</i>

235
00:18:42,458 --> 00:18:46,875
<i>If you're the needle, I'm the thread</i>

236
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:53,583
<i>Then why our union</i>

237
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:58,583
<i>So half-baked, half-baked?</i>

238
00:18:59,917 --> 00:19:03,542
Dad thinks that I can't lip sync to songs.

239
00:19:23,542 --> 00:19:26,250
<i>I'm a fine catch, so are you</i>

240
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:29,167
<i>Marry me, my love</i>

241
00:19:29,542 --> 00:19:34,458
<i>Let sparks fly
So fine, so bright</i>

242
00:19:47,042 --> 00:19:49,750
<i>I'm a fine catch, so are you</i>

243
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:52,667
<i>But, I'm a free bird</i>

244
00:19:53,042 --> 00:19:58,000
<i>Keep your fireworks
Too fine, too bright</i>

245
00:19:58,083 --> 00:20:00,792
<i>Take my hand
Marry me quick</i>

246
00:20:00,917 --> 00:20:03,875
<i>Make me yours in a click</i>

247
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:06,542
<i>Listen up, I'm a wild stallion</i>

248
00:20:06,667 --> 00:20:09,875
<i>Why reduce me to a mere medallion?</i>

249
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:14,583
<i>I'm a fine catch, so are you</i>

250
00:20:14,792 --> 00:20:17,500
<i>Marry me, my love</i>

251
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:21,667
<i>Let sparks fly
So fine, so bright</i>

252
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:23,292
<i>No way, love!</i>

253
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:26,167
<i>I'm a fine catch, so are you</i>

254
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:28,917
<i>But, I'm a free bird</i>

255
00:20:29,417 --> 00:20:34,542
<i>Keep your fireworks
Too fine, too bright</i>

256
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:42,333
<i>That night, one more Pomeranian
turned into an Alsatian.</i>

257
00:20:42,417 --> 00:20:44,542
<i>God's powder was magic.</i>

258
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:47,125
<i>My confidence was sky-rocketing.</i>

259
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,250
- Where's the bottle?
- Your dad chucked it.

260
00:20:53,917 --> 00:20:57,708
Damn! For how long will he control me?

261
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:01,625
My father controlled me for 60 years.

262
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:04,250
- How did he let go?
- He popped it.

263
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:09,625
Dudes, don't leave. The vodka's coming.

264
00:21:09,708 --> 00:21:11,917
The bar's closed, Sanju.

265
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,750
Dad thinks cutting supply
will make us quit?

266
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:17,917
I have a back-up daddy

267
00:21:18,042 --> 00:21:20,208
who'll fill up our mugs.

268
00:21:20,292 --> 00:21:23,000
- Back-up dad?
- My girlfriend's pop.

269
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:38,375
Is daddy home?

270
00:21:38,917 --> 00:21:41,375
Yes, don't sneak in through the balcony.

271
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:44,292
I'll ring the doorbell. Wake him.

272
00:21:46,417 --> 00:21:47,667
At this hour?

273
00:21:49,042 --> 00:21:50,417
What's so important?

274
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,542
I want something, baby.

275
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:01,292
I'll be there in five. Open the door.

276
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:11,708
Wake up your dad.

277
00:22:17,125 --> 00:22:21,667
Dad, mom... wake up. Sanju's here.

278
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:23,958
At 1 a.m.? Is everything okay?

279
00:22:24,042 --> 00:22:26,208
Took him six months to muster courage.

280
00:22:26,292 --> 00:22:28,958
He'd said, once his career kick started,

281
00:22:29,083 --> 00:22:31,583
he'll ask for my hand.

282
00:22:31,667 --> 00:22:34,542
Just the hand, or all of you?

283
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:40,208
We'll ask for the 18-year-old scotch.

284
00:22:40,417 --> 00:22:41,833
Will the old fart agree?

285
00:22:41,958 --> 00:22:44,875
If he doesn't agree, we grab and flee!

286
00:22:47,083 --> 00:22:49,167
Hello, child. How are you?

287
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:53,375
Before you ask for anything,
I have something for you.

288
00:22:58,417 --> 00:22:59,250
Ten rupees?

289
00:22:59,833 --> 00:23:02,667
My father's gift to me
when I joined the Navy.

290
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:06,167
He said, "There are two kinds of bills."

291
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,958
"Real and fake."

292
00:23:09,208 --> 00:23:12,000
When you tug at a real bill...

293
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:15,375
it won't tear.

294
00:23:16,375 --> 00:23:18,708
You're starting your career.

295
00:23:18,792 --> 00:23:22,000
Life will pull you left and right.

296
00:23:22,083 --> 00:23:27,458
But if you stay honest,
nothing can rip you apart.

297
00:23:29,083 --> 00:23:32,208
My father's wisdom is now yours.

298
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:34,292
Homi, let him sit.

299
00:23:34,375 --> 00:23:36,042
Sit.

300
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,542
Now tell us.

301
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:40,667
What brings you here?

302
00:23:42,917 --> 00:23:47,792
The real reason we're here is...
we have the midnight urge.

303
00:23:50,375 --> 00:23:51,750
Can't control it anymore.

304
00:23:57,292 --> 00:24:00,667
Look, we're weak with idioms.

305
00:24:01,375 --> 00:24:04,292
Tell us clearly, what's a "midnight urge"?

306
00:24:04,375 --> 00:24:06,208
Midnight urge means...

307
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,417
I'm 21 now. It's a biological need.

308
00:24:15,583 --> 00:24:19,292
As soon as midnight strikes...
the urge surges.

309
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:23,708
I need it now... or I'm gonna explode!

310
00:24:24,667 --> 00:24:26,958
But dad doesn't allow it.

311
00:24:27,208 --> 00:24:30,250
He's orthodox. So I sin in secret.

312
00:24:30,958 --> 00:24:34,500
Once, I was enjoying an 18-year-old
on the terrace... dad walked in.

313
00:24:34,583 --> 00:24:38,333
I told him frankly, "Dad, I'm an adult.

314
00:24:38,417 --> 00:24:41,625
My friends do it every night.
Their parents never object."

315
00:24:41,875 --> 00:24:46,167
He said, "Alright, have your 18-year-old.
But don't hide.

316
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:49,000
Do it openly on the dining table,
before the family.

317
00:24:49,083 --> 00:24:51,500
And that too, only once a month."

318
00:24:51,583 --> 00:24:54,333
Daddy, how will once a month
quench this thirst?

319
00:24:54,875 --> 00:24:56,792
Now I frequent the illicit joints.

320
00:24:56,875 --> 00:24:59,458
16, 18, 21...
I grab whatever is available.

321
00:24:59,958 --> 00:25:05,083
I park on a lonely stretch,
and indulge in the backseat.

322
00:25:05,167 --> 00:25:06,833
Only fear is the cops.

323
00:25:07,333 --> 00:25:09,667
They peek when you're about to peak.

324
00:25:09,958 --> 00:25:12,333
Ma'am, try the backseat.

325
00:25:15,167 --> 00:25:17,667
You were a Navy Captain.

326
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:21,000
You must've tasted the best
on every shore.

327
00:25:22,625 --> 00:25:27,333
Be kind, let us taste some from your home.

328
00:25:29,708 --> 00:25:31,958
- May we get one each?
- What!

329
00:25:32,375 --> 00:25:33,667
Okay, we'll share one.

330
00:25:35,875 --> 00:25:38,625
When daddy gets the urge,
you happily serve.

331
00:25:38,917 --> 00:25:42,667
All we get is a "How dare you!"
Sorry, I've promised my friend.

332
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:45,833
I'm gonna grab one.

333
00:25:45,958 --> 00:25:48,167
Stop!

334
00:25:51,083 --> 00:25:52,083
Soda or water?

335
00:25:57,833 --> 00:25:59,625
And return my papa's box.

336
00:26:03,542 --> 00:26:04,958
Can I say something?

337
00:26:06,042 --> 00:26:08,625
Your papa was wrong.

338
00:26:08,708 --> 00:26:13,792
Life doesn't just pull you left and right.

339
00:26:14,417 --> 00:26:17,417
It also pulls you up and down.

340
00:26:29,542 --> 00:26:31,792
<i>I drank all night with my friends.</i>

341
00:26:32,333 --> 00:26:33,917
<i>And returned home in the morning.</i>

342
00:26:44,708 --> 00:26:46,542
I'm going for a jog.

343
00:26:54,708 --> 00:26:55,583
Sit.

344
00:26:59,958 --> 00:27:03,167
Sorry, sonny. I yelled at you publicly.

345
00:27:03,792 --> 00:27:08,375
I'm stressed, so couldn't control myself.

346
00:27:10,083 --> 00:27:11,167
A request...

347
00:27:12,458 --> 00:27:15,000
Please focus on your work.

348
00:27:15,083 --> 00:27:18,750
Your mother should feel proud
when she sees your first film.

349
00:27:19,833 --> 00:27:23,542
She may not be able to see your next.

350
00:27:24,708 --> 00:27:25,542
Why?

351
00:27:29,958 --> 00:27:32,417
She has cancer of the pancreas.

352
00:27:33,125 --> 00:27:36,875
I'm taking her to New York.
Sloan Hospital.

353
00:27:36,958 --> 00:27:39,708
Why didn't anyone tell me?

354
00:27:39,792 --> 00:27:43,250
She hid it from you
so your work won't suffer.

355
00:27:43,667 --> 00:27:46,375
She's been in pain all year.

356
00:27:46,833 --> 00:27:49,333
But acts fit in front of you.

357
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:51,083
Where are you?

358
00:27:51,792 --> 00:27:54,000
In the dining. Want some tea?

359
00:27:54,083 --> 00:27:55,333
Half a cup.

360
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:56,875
Hide it.

361
00:27:59,083 --> 00:28:00,500
Don't cry in her presence.

362
00:28:00,583 --> 00:28:03,583
She's acting. So must you.

363
00:28:05,042 --> 00:28:07,583
Up so early?

364
00:28:08,958 --> 00:28:11,333
Did you tell Sanju we're off to New York?

365
00:28:12,458 --> 00:28:15,750
What? Haven't shared the news?

366
00:28:17,083 --> 00:28:20,750
Take a deep breath.
You're gonna be shocked.

367
00:28:22,083 --> 00:28:25,125
I've been offered a Hollywood film.

368
00:28:25,917 --> 00:28:28,333
Now I'll mouth English dialogues.

369
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:32,583
James Bond.

370
00:28:45,125 --> 00:28:48,167
I wish they had songs like our films.

371
00:28:48,625 --> 00:28:52,583
<i>This heart has lost its mate</i>

372
00:28:53,083 --> 00:28:57,167
<i>No one knows where my liver went</i>

373
00:28:58,042 --> 00:29:00,958
A song here, a dance there,

374
00:29:01,208 --> 00:29:03,000
and the Oscar's mine!

375
00:29:03,708 --> 00:29:05,792
You shouldn't have retired!

376
00:29:05,875 --> 00:29:08,917
Retired? I still act, don't I?

377
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
<i>Dad took mom to New York.</i>

378
00:29:33,083 --> 00:29:35,542
<i>And I started spending more time with God.</i>

379
00:29:37,708 --> 00:29:41,875
I was 18 when I lost my parents
in a car crash.

380
00:29:41,958 --> 00:29:44,458
I was going to kill myself.

381
00:29:44,875 --> 00:29:47,000
A fakir saved me.

382
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:51,167
He said, "The Lord who created pain,
also created a remedy."

383
00:29:51,833 --> 00:29:52,833
Here.

384
00:29:53,042 --> 00:29:56,083
Put it under your tongue.
It'll melt away all pain.

385
00:29:56,167 --> 00:29:59,375
He gets it from the Himalayas.
So it's expensive.

386
00:29:59,542 --> 00:30:01,917
But I'll send him the money.

387
00:30:28,208 --> 00:30:31,917
<i>The first time I did drugs,
was 'cause I was upset with dad.</i>

388
00:30:32,333 --> 00:30:35,167
<i>The second time, 'cause mom was dying.</i>

389
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:39,750
<i>By the third time, I was an addict.</i>

390
00:30:42,125 --> 00:30:44,833
<i>Then I got the news
that mom was in a coma.</i>

391
00:30:44,958 --> 00:30:47,250
<i>Dad summoned me to America.</i>

392
00:30:47,333 --> 00:30:49,375
<i>I traveled with my sisters...</i>

393
00:30:49,542 --> 00:30:51,417
<i>and 20 grams of cocaine.</i>

394
00:30:54,625 --> 00:30:57,000
<i>Being caught at the airport,
would've meant</i>

395
00:30:57,333 --> 00:31:00,833
<i>20 years in prison... even for my sisters.</i>

396
00:31:01,417 --> 00:31:03,250
<i>But back then, 20 years in prison,</i>

397
00:31:03,333 --> 00:31:04,958
<i>versus 20 grams of cocaine...</i>

398
00:31:05,208 --> 00:31:07,250
<i>my choice was crystal clear.</i>

399
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,042
<i>I was so irresponsible</i>

400
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:13,292
<i>that instead of spending time with mom,</i>

401
00:31:13,375 --> 00:31:16,125
<i>I'd smoke away in the fire exit.</i>

402
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:19,500
<i>Then one night, walked into my life...</i>

403
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,875
<i>Mr. Kamlesh Kanhaiyalal Kapasi.</i>

404
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:45,625
- What did you steal?
- Twins...

405
00:31:46,125 --> 00:31:50,000
- O Lord Ganesha!
- This is Jesus' jurisdiction.

406
00:31:50,417 --> 00:31:53,417
Lord Ganesha doesn't operate here.
What did you steal?

407
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:56,917
I'd gone to keep the idol inside.

408
00:32:07,292 --> 00:32:11,250
I'm a fan of your parents.

409
00:32:11,917 --> 00:32:14,750
Thought Lord Ganesha
will heal your mother.

410
00:32:18,917 --> 00:32:20,083
But, what's "Twins"?

411
00:32:21,542 --> 00:32:24,625
Eggs. Back home we call them Twins.

412
00:32:27,333 --> 00:32:29,292
Hope "The Twins" haven't parted ways.

413
00:32:29,667 --> 00:32:30,917
They are out of shape.

414
00:32:33,333 --> 00:32:34,250
Come.

415
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,875
- Where?
- To get The Twins back in shape.

416
00:33:15,125 --> 00:33:16,917
Ever seen a topless girl?

417
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:19,000
Of course, I have.

418
00:33:19,333 --> 00:33:22,083
- Where? On TV?
- No, live.

419
00:33:22,292 --> 00:33:25,917
My physics teacher, back home...

420
00:33:26,333 --> 00:33:28,375
his mother slipped in the bathroom.

421
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:31,458
I broke the door,
hauled her on my shoulder

422
00:33:31,542 --> 00:33:33,083
and put her in the ambulance.

423
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:36,000
Stark naked... topless, bottomless.

424
00:33:36,292 --> 00:33:38,125
How old was she?

425
00:33:38,208 --> 00:33:39,833
Ninety. No, 91.

426
00:33:42,417 --> 00:33:44,125
I did see stuff. I'm not naive.

427
00:33:44,875 --> 00:33:47,208
- Ever had alcohol?
- Of course.

428
00:34:11,875 --> 00:34:13,708
There's a saying back home...

429
00:34:13,833 --> 00:34:16,083
"Jam-jam bam-bam."

430
00:34:16,583 --> 00:34:17,667
Translate that.

431
00:34:18,083 --> 00:34:19,667
"Jam-jam" is money.

432
00:34:19,875 --> 00:34:21,667
And "bam-bam"?

433
00:34:23,083 --> 00:34:24,333
Sex.

434
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:30,000
Your jacket took away jam-jam,
I lost my bam-bam.

435
00:34:30,417 --> 00:34:33,208
You owe me a blonde.

436
00:34:39,167 --> 00:34:40,833
Cover me.

437
00:34:52,333 --> 00:34:53,583
Don't! You'll land in prison.

438
00:34:53,667 --> 00:34:55,083
Relax.

439
00:35:49,667 --> 00:35:50,667
Run!

440
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:08,417
Stop joking. We could've been arrested.

441
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:10,833
Noble cause, brother.

442
00:36:13,458 --> 00:36:17,458
Your mom's in the hospital
and you're snorting?

443
00:36:17,667 --> 00:36:19,875
Hey, Mr. Righteousness.

444
00:36:20,042 --> 00:36:22,042
We've been friends for just five minutes.

445
00:36:22,625 --> 00:36:25,333
- Control your emotions.
- Friendship?

446
00:36:25,625 --> 00:36:29,167
You aren't a good son!
How'll you be a good friend?

447
00:36:33,833 --> 00:36:36,042
Get lost! I don't need a friend.

448
00:36:43,083 --> 00:36:44,458
Hey, stop!

449
00:36:52,125 --> 00:36:53,667
I just can't quit.

450
00:36:58,625 --> 00:37:00,042
Alright, go!

451
00:37:00,667 --> 00:37:05,000
If my friend was on drugs,
I wouldn't abandon him.

452
00:37:05,083 --> 00:37:06,667
I'd thrash him till he quit.

453
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:17,375
Throw it.

454
00:37:17,458 --> 00:37:20,000
- I'll quit tomorrow.
- Now.

455
00:37:20,167 --> 00:37:21,750
I promise, tomorrow.

456
00:37:22,833 --> 00:37:25,625
- Let go my twins.
- Let go the powder.

457
00:37:25,917 --> 00:37:28,083
- Twins first.
- Powder first.

458
00:37:28,375 --> 00:37:30,792
- I'm desperate.
- It's the time to fight.

459
00:37:31,167 --> 00:37:32,417
Say, "I'm a tiger."

460
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:34,083
- Now, rorr.
- "Rorr"?

461
00:37:36,083 --> 00:37:36,917
Once more.

462
00:37:41,375 --> 00:37:44,417
I quit! I promise.

463
00:37:46,875 --> 00:37:50,958
Never abandon me, Master.
Such words of wisdom...

464
00:37:51,292 --> 00:37:54,625
Rorr, jam-jam bam-bam, twins.

465
00:37:55,625 --> 00:37:57,083
Guess what?

466
00:37:57,208 --> 00:37:58,750
You didn't twist my twins...

467
00:37:59,833 --> 00:38:00,958
but this.

468
00:38:09,833 --> 00:38:12,083
<i>I was seeking drugs in New York.</i>

469
00:38:12,167 --> 00:38:14,000
<i>Instead, I found a friend.</i>

470
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:17,333
Kamlesh Kanhaiyalal Kapasi.
They call me Kamli.

471
00:38:17,542 --> 00:38:21,375
As Sex-spear has said, "What's in a name?"

472
00:38:21,917 --> 00:38:24,500
- Who?
- Sex-spear.

473
00:38:25,167 --> 00:38:26,625
William...

474
00:38:27,208 --> 00:38:29,500
- Sir, will you have snakes?
- Snakes?

475
00:38:29,792 --> 00:38:32,083
Snakes. There are lots in the hole.

476
00:38:32,875 --> 00:38:34,125
I'll get it, sir.

477
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:42,750
<i>In his accent, snacks were "snakes"
and hall was "hole".</i>

478
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,042
<i>He brought back our smiles.</i>

479
00:38:46,125 --> 00:38:51,083
<i>And miraculously,
his idol got mom out of coma.</i>

480
00:38:51,292 --> 00:38:52,833
Ready, everyone?

481
00:38:53,167 --> 00:38:55,000
Smile.

482
00:39:10,542 --> 00:39:15,292
At your film premiere,
I'll sit between father and son.

483
00:39:16,125 --> 00:39:19,375
As you appear on screen, I'll whistle.

484
00:39:24,208 --> 00:39:28,125
At your wedding, I'll dance on the table.

485
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,583
Warn Ruby not to be embarrassed.

486
00:39:33,583 --> 00:39:38,333
<i>Mom didn't know Ruby wasn't talking to me.</i>

487
00:39:42,833 --> 00:39:44,542
<i>Mom didn't have much time left.</i>

488
00:39:44,958 --> 00:39:46,333
<i>I decided</i>

489
00:39:46,417 --> 00:39:50,625
<i>I'd apologize to Ruby's dad
and ask for her hand.</i>

490
00:39:51,333 --> 00:39:53,083
I love Ruby and I want to...

491
00:39:56,125 --> 00:39:57,917
I've come to apologize.

492
00:39:58,208 --> 00:40:01,125
- I misbehaved that day.
- It's alright, child.

493
00:40:01,292 --> 00:40:03,292
- A tipple often does that.
- No, Daddy.

494
00:40:03,875 --> 00:40:07,042
I wasn't just drunk...
I had also done cocaine.

495
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:13,833
Let me confess. The next day I did LSD.

496
00:40:14,208 --> 00:40:16,458
But I've been clean for a month.

497
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:20,083
Congratulations!

498
00:40:24,958 --> 00:40:26,250
I'll go meet Ruby.

499
00:40:27,083 --> 00:40:29,292
- Ruby.
- Wait.

500
00:40:29,625 --> 00:40:32,292
Meet her on the 22nd
at Hotel Sun and Sand,

501
00:40:32,375 --> 00:40:34,417
with these flowers.

502
00:40:34,875 --> 00:40:36,833
- What's on the 22nd?
- Wait.

503
00:40:43,875 --> 00:40:46,125
That's for your parents.

504
00:40:46,292 --> 00:40:48,375
And that's for you. Write your name.

505
00:40:48,458 --> 00:40:51,292
"Ruby weds..." Who's this Rustom?

506
00:40:54,458 --> 00:40:58,375
All this for a 10 rupee bill?
I'll glue it up.

507
00:40:58,458 --> 00:41:02,417
I'm glad you tore it. It led us to Rustom!

508
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:05,750
He's a doctor in New York.
Not a junkie like you.

509
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,375
Daddy, let me meet Ruby--

510
00:41:14,167 --> 00:41:16,417
Then what should I call you? Old fart?

511
00:41:16,833 --> 00:41:20,417
Meet Ruby over my dead body.

512
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:22,375
Fine, I'll wait.

513
00:41:22,458 --> 00:41:23,333
For what?

514
00:41:23,417 --> 00:41:25,083
For you to die, old fart!

515
00:41:27,917 --> 00:41:29,917
Rascal! Scoundrel!

516
00:41:30,125 --> 00:41:32,417
Get out!

517
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:34,542
I'll break your legs, you swine.

518
00:41:36,958 --> 00:41:41,333
<i>Every addict looks for an excuse
to start again.</i>

519
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:43,833
<i>My excuse was Ruby.</i>

520
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:58,375
<i>Ruby, Ruby, Ruby
Let's rendezvous</i>

521
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,375
<i>To have you back</i>

522
00:42:10,042 --> 00:42:13,708
<i>Your old man I'll hack</i>

523
00:42:18,083 --> 00:42:21,667
<i>It's a win-win!</i>

524
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:25,708
<i>He gets heaven, I get you</i>

525
00:42:27,625 --> 00:42:31,083
<i>The world has no heart</i>

526
00:42:31,167 --> 00:42:34,792
<i>So leave it, old fart</i>

527
00:42:35,458 --> 00:42:39,167
<i>Goodbye, old man! Just die, old man!</i>

528
00:42:39,417 --> 00:42:44,750
<i>Your daughter, don't worry
Once you're dead, we'll marry</i>

529
00:42:45,208 --> 00:42:49,292
<i>The sincerest prayers are always granted.</i>

530
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:54,917
<i>The old man died
of a massive heart attack.</i>

531
00:42:55,083 --> 00:43:00,583
<i>The news was tragic. But I won't lie,</i>

532
00:43:00,667 --> 00:43:02,833
<i>I was ecstatic.</i>

533
00:43:03,542 --> 00:43:08,625
<i>Ruby, Ruby, Ruby
Get set to rendezvous</i>

534
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,917
<i>Ruby, Ruby, Ruby
You and I, we'll rendezvous</i>

535
00:43:22,875 --> 00:43:26,875
<i>This was my chance to win back Ruby.</i>

536
00:43:31,792 --> 00:43:36,042
<i>I had to show her,
I was more reliable than her fiancé.</i>

537
00:43:39,083 --> 00:43:43,458
<i>A minor problem... I was stoned.</i>

538
00:43:43,542 --> 00:43:45,125
Papa!

539
00:43:45,708 --> 00:43:47,708
Don't abandon us, Papa.

540
00:43:47,917 --> 00:43:51,333
- Sanju, that's not papa.
- Wake up.

541
00:43:51,792 --> 00:43:53,000
That's not papa!

542
00:43:57,458 --> 00:43:59,958
Ha! I wondered how he'd shrunk so much.

543
00:44:04,583 --> 00:44:07,333
Is this our papa?

544
00:44:09,458 --> 00:44:11,583
Papa!

545
00:44:12,083 --> 00:44:14,375
Why did you abandon us?

546
00:44:14,542 --> 00:44:16,458
Wake up. Try!

547
00:44:19,875 --> 00:44:21,375
He isn't waking up.

548
00:44:22,083 --> 00:44:24,042
Mummy, don't cry.

549
00:44:24,167 --> 00:44:26,500
Your son-in-law is with you.

550
00:44:30,083 --> 00:44:32,708
Have you read the Holy Gita?

551
00:44:33,375 --> 00:44:36,417
"Everything happens for the best."
Superb!

552
00:44:37,250 --> 00:44:39,917
"Nothing we create...

553
00:44:40,292 --> 00:44:43,208
so nothing should we mourn."

554
00:44:43,875 --> 00:44:47,083
Did you create this old man?
Gave him birth?

555
00:44:52,250 --> 00:44:53,708
Let her grieve.

556
00:44:53,792 --> 00:44:56,583
When my puppy died, I was bawling.

557
00:44:56,667 --> 00:45:00,458
A full-grown husband's exit
deserves howling.

558
00:45:00,542 --> 00:45:02,125
Take your time, Mummy.

559
00:45:02,208 --> 00:45:06,417
But remember, only the body perishes.

560
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:08,250
The soul is eternal.

561
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:10,042
Away with this body.

562
00:45:10,333 --> 00:45:12,292
Focus on the soul.

563
00:45:16,042 --> 00:45:18,292
Papa conked and you say, "All okay?"

564
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:22,458
How shall we dispose the body?

565
00:45:22,583 --> 00:45:24,792
Bury it? Cremate it?

566
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:29,417
God, that's not our papa.

567
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:32,417
Move that body. It's freaking confusing.

568
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Move it.

569
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:35,875
So, Ruby...

570
00:45:40,667 --> 00:45:41,958
What did I do?

571
00:45:46,625 --> 00:45:49,417
No one can tell it's secondhand.

572
00:45:49,833 --> 00:45:51,292
A very fair price.

573
00:45:52,125 --> 00:45:53,583
Five hundred dollars.

574
00:45:55,917 --> 00:45:57,000
What's this?

575
00:45:57,458 --> 00:45:59,083
Robbed a beggar?

576
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:02,000
Robbed a barber! He cuts his own hair.

577
00:46:02,083 --> 00:46:04,167
Puts three dollars in the piggy bank.

578
00:46:04,292 --> 00:46:08,375
- Who's gonna count this?
- Call from India. It's Sanju!

579
00:46:08,458 --> 00:46:10,542
Awesome!

580
00:46:12,750 --> 00:46:18,208
Sanju, perfect timing.
I'm buying my first car.

581
00:46:18,292 --> 00:46:20,167
I need you here, bro.

582
00:46:22,750 --> 00:46:24,917
Ruby's getting married.

583
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,250
<i>Please come.</i>

584
00:46:26,417 --> 00:46:29,792
- You snorting again?
- No. I swear.

585
00:46:29,875 --> 00:46:32,375
Please... come down.

586
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,625
Sanju... Hello?

587
00:46:38,958 --> 00:46:41,167
Sir, no need to count.

588
00:46:41,333 --> 00:46:43,708
- The car will have to wait.
- Why?

589
00:46:43,792 --> 00:46:47,083
Need to buy a ticket to India.

590
00:46:49,833 --> 00:46:50,958
Sorry, sir.

591
00:46:51,208 --> 00:46:53,125
Didn't want the car? Why make me count?

592
00:47:01,792 --> 00:47:02,958
Hello, Ruby.

593
00:47:03,250 --> 00:47:06,292
I'm Kamlesh Kanhaiyalal Kapasi.
Sanju's friend.

594
00:47:07,125 --> 00:47:09,042
Sir, can you go inside?

595
00:47:09,292 --> 00:47:10,417
Take a loo break.

596
00:47:12,292 --> 00:47:15,208
- Need to discuss a private matter.
- Come.

597
00:47:19,333 --> 00:47:22,750
Whatever the matter,
say it in front of me.

598
00:47:23,167 --> 00:47:25,250
It'll upset you.

599
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:28,542
Take a stroll outside. Lovely weather.

600
00:47:32,625 --> 00:47:34,000
Really?

601
00:47:37,542 --> 00:47:39,750
Then name Ruby's favorite animal.

602
00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:47,042
You live in New York?

603
00:47:47,625 --> 00:47:51,167
Ask any jeweler there...

604
00:47:51,375 --> 00:47:53,583
They'll all say... "Penguin".

605
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,458
- Know why?
- Why?

606
00:47:56,583 --> 00:48:00,167
For a month, Sanju hopped
from jeweler to jeweler

607
00:48:00,333 --> 00:48:04,292
for a wedding necklace
with a penguin pendant.

608
00:48:04,833 --> 00:48:06,375
And finally got it!

609
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:08,375
But when he returned to India,

610
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:11,083
he discovered that you were engaged.

611
00:48:11,792 --> 00:48:15,083
He was shattered, so took to drugs again.

612
00:48:15,167 --> 00:48:17,417
But yesterday, he braved up.

613
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:19,708
Flushed all the drugs down the drain.

614
00:48:20,167 --> 00:48:22,542
Swore never to touch them again.

615
00:48:22,625 --> 00:48:25,375
He prayed, "Lord, bring Ruby back."

616
00:48:26,208 --> 00:48:28,083
Sanju's back.

617
00:48:28,583 --> 00:48:29,792
Can you come back?

618
00:48:31,750 --> 00:48:34,208
The wedding date, venue... it's all set.

619
00:48:34,292 --> 00:48:36,542
Nothing changes, except the groom.

620
00:48:36,625 --> 00:48:38,542
The wedding cards have been printed.

621
00:48:38,625 --> 00:48:41,750
We'll put a "Sanju" sticker
over your name.

622
00:48:41,833 --> 00:48:43,375
Don't sweat the small stuff.

623
00:48:48,750 --> 00:48:52,750
Ruby, in America
there'll be no house help.

624
00:48:52,958 --> 00:48:55,208
You'll be cleaning, mopping, washing...

625
00:48:55,375 --> 00:48:57,917
Imagine washing his sweaty underpants!

626
00:48:59,625 --> 00:49:01,167
I told you, you'd be upset.

627
00:49:01,250 --> 00:49:05,083
Sanju will be at the Marriage Registrar's,
tomorrow at 4 p.m.

628
00:49:19,875 --> 00:49:21,667
Mister, what's her favorite food?

629
00:49:24,042 --> 00:49:26,417
Waffles. Sanju knows.

630
00:49:28,250 --> 00:49:29,625
Her favorite film?

631
00:49:30,833 --> 00:49:32,250
<i>Mary Poppins.</i>

632
00:49:32,375 --> 00:49:35,292
Sanju knows. You have no clue.

633
00:49:35,833 --> 00:49:37,208
Ruby, 4 p.m. tomorrow.

634
00:49:37,625 --> 00:49:39,750
The Marriage Registrar's office.

635
00:49:55,708 --> 00:49:57,792
Where did you get money for this?

636
00:49:58,125 --> 00:50:00,250
Your wallet, checks... They're with me.

637
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,292
The wedding necklace...

638
00:50:05,417 --> 00:50:06,500
What about it?

639
00:50:06,625 --> 00:50:09,083
I sold it to God.

640
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:23,875
- Where's he?
- He isn't home.

641
00:50:23,958 --> 00:50:25,833
<i>Woo-hoo!</i>

642
00:50:39,250 --> 00:50:43,167
I wait at the Registrar's office
and you get stoned here?

643
00:50:43,708 --> 00:50:47,417
No sweat. We'll marry tomorrow.

644
00:50:50,958 --> 00:50:54,792
You'd flushed the drugs!
Fished them out again?

645
00:51:01,292 --> 00:51:04,083
Where's the wedding necklace?

646
00:51:05,708 --> 00:51:07,292
Where is it?

647
00:51:07,792 --> 00:51:10,083
Where's the bloody necklace?

648
00:51:19,292 --> 00:51:20,708
The wedding necklace.

649
00:51:46,458 --> 00:51:48,250
Please wait, Ruby.

650
00:51:50,458 --> 00:51:52,375
I'm sorry...

651
00:51:53,167 --> 00:51:54,167
Yuck.

652
00:51:54,417 --> 00:51:58,083
He's not in his senses.
Won't remember a thing tomorrow!

653
00:51:58,167 --> 00:52:01,708
I swear, he did buy the wedding necklace.

654
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,292
He's too far gone

655
00:52:06,583 --> 00:52:09,208
and to expect you'll hang on is not right.

656
00:52:10,708 --> 00:52:14,083
You move on, I'm with him.

657
00:52:24,625 --> 00:52:25,875
Kamlesh.

658
00:52:26,250 --> 00:52:27,208
Yes, Ruby.

659
00:52:27,292 --> 00:52:29,458
Don't ever tell him what he did.

660
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,708
He'll be devastated.

661
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,333
Tell him...

662
00:52:34,458 --> 00:52:36,917
that rotten Ruby never showed up.

663
00:52:56,750 --> 00:52:58,417
You've been drinking?

664
00:52:58,542 --> 00:53:02,375
What I wanna say needs courage.

665
00:53:03,208 --> 00:53:05,792
So I downed a couple.

666
00:53:06,667 --> 00:53:07,917
Tell me.

667
00:53:09,458 --> 00:53:12,625
Your son will die before your wife!

668
00:53:13,125 --> 00:53:16,292
- He can't handle his life.
- Why?

669
00:53:17,042 --> 00:53:20,042
He sees you nursing your ailing wife.

670
00:53:20,750 --> 00:53:25,375
Any responsibility at home,
film industry, society...

671
00:53:25,750 --> 00:53:28,333
he sees you never shirk it.

672
00:53:31,125 --> 00:53:33,000
And your son...

673
00:53:34,417 --> 00:53:36,875
He's an ordinary guy.

674
00:53:37,167 --> 00:53:40,292
No goals, no purpose in life.

675
00:53:40,375 --> 00:53:45,042
He says,
"There are three things to life, bro."

676
00:53:46,333 --> 00:53:49,333
"C, B, S."

677
00:53:50,208 --> 00:53:53,458
"Chew, brew and scr..."

678
00:53:59,208 --> 00:54:02,833
The problem is, you want him to be you!

679
00:54:04,750 --> 00:54:05,917
He's buried...

680
00:54:06,292 --> 00:54:09,708
buried under the weight of your legacy!

681
00:54:10,208 --> 00:54:14,125
He knows, however hard he toils,
he can never be as great.

682
00:54:14,208 --> 00:54:17,083
So, he doesn't even try.

683
00:54:19,167 --> 00:54:22,125
Feels a hero with nobodies like me.

684
00:54:22,208 --> 00:54:25,750
"Yo, Kamli...", "Hey, Kamli..."

685
00:54:29,625 --> 00:54:32,667
What should I do, Kamlesh?

686
00:54:32,750 --> 00:54:34,292
Sir, you...

687
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,833
Just be his friend.

688
00:54:40,917 --> 00:54:42,833
Sit with him.

689
00:54:43,250 --> 00:54:44,667
Drink with him.

690
00:54:44,750 --> 00:54:47,417
Use a few cuss words, and say...

691
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:52,292
"Sonny, it's okay to be ordinary."

692
00:54:52,792 --> 00:54:54,958
"You don't have to be Sunil Dutt."

693
00:54:55,042 --> 00:54:57,833
"It's okay to be Sanjay Dutt.”

694
00:54:58,333 --> 00:55:01,917
Sir, please save him.

695
00:55:03,750 --> 00:55:04,833
If he dies,

696
00:55:04,917 --> 00:55:08,708
whom will I tell, "Let go my twins"?

697
00:55:11,750 --> 00:55:14,417
Please, sir, save him.

698
00:55:17,333 --> 00:55:19,000
Save him.

699
00:55:39,083 --> 00:55:41,292
I showed the distributors your film.

700
00:55:41,417 --> 00:55:46,458
They went crazy...
"What a freaking actor!"

701
00:55:52,042 --> 00:55:53,792
Has mom seen the posters?

702
00:55:54,083 --> 00:55:55,917
She's in hospital.

703
00:55:56,458 --> 00:55:57,375
What happened?

704
00:55:58,792 --> 00:56:01,083
She slipped into a coma again.

705
00:56:01,167 --> 00:56:04,917
- I just met her yesterday!
- No, day before.

706
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:08,833
You've woken up after two days. It's okay.

707
00:56:13,167 --> 00:56:14,958
I've spoken to the doctors.

708
00:56:15,042 --> 00:56:18,167
They recommend a rehab center in America.

709
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:19,375
Ready?

710
00:56:20,125 --> 00:56:21,125
No!

711
00:56:21,375 --> 00:56:22,875
Please don't send me there, Dad.

712
00:56:23,042 --> 00:56:24,750
Just a few days, sonny.

713
00:56:25,250 --> 00:56:26,417
No.

714
00:56:30,708 --> 00:56:34,125
Come out. We won't send you anywhere.

715
00:56:34,208 --> 00:56:37,042
I had one cigarette, you packed me off
to boarding school.

716
00:56:37,125 --> 00:56:39,958
I was just six.
Couldn't even tie my shoelaces.

717
00:56:40,042 --> 00:56:41,333
I missed mom.

718
00:56:43,250 --> 00:56:44,167
Please come out.

719
00:56:45,417 --> 00:56:47,208
I won't go anywhere.

720
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:50,000
I'll stay with mom in the hospital!

721
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:58,000
<i>Dad agreed... on one condition.</i>

722
00:56:58,125 --> 00:57:01,417
<i>That I wouldn't do drugs in the hospital.</i>

723
00:57:01,708 --> 00:57:03,125
<i>And I promised.</i>

724
00:57:03,750 --> 00:57:06,167
<i>I started spending
every night at the hospital.</i>

725
00:57:06,667 --> 00:57:09,292
<i>I'd stare at mom for hours.</i>

726
00:57:09,625 --> 00:57:12,083
<i>I'd hold her hand and talk to her.</i>

727
00:57:12,458 --> 00:57:14,500
The premiere's next week.

728
00:57:14,667 --> 00:57:16,000
Won't you come?

729
00:57:16,458 --> 00:57:17,458
Get up, Mom.

730
00:57:17,792 --> 00:57:19,625
You gotta see me act.

731
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,917
You'll be proud, Mom.

732
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:23,958
Mom.

733
00:57:26,458 --> 00:57:27,667
<i>Then one day...</i>

734
00:57:27,875 --> 00:57:29,250
<i>I couldn't resist.</i>

735
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,375
<i>Sanju...</i>

736
00:58:55,542 --> 00:58:57,667
<i>Mom never saw my film.</i>

737
00:58:58,417 --> 00:59:02,083
<i>She died three days before the premiere.</i>

738
00:59:02,667 --> 00:59:04,000
<i>She'd left a note...</i>

739
00:59:04,083 --> 00:59:07,000
<i>"Even if I'm gone, the show must go on."</i>

740
00:59:14,458 --> 00:59:20,042
<i>They call me Rocky
Yes, my name is Rocky!</i>

741
00:59:21,250 --> 00:59:28,042
<i>Friend and foe
To both I say hello</i>

742
00:59:28,917 --> 00:59:35,500
<i>Friend and foe
To both I say hello</i>

743
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:42,667
<i>They call me Rocky
Yes, my name is Rocky!</i>

744
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:47,250
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

745
00:59:48,792 --> 00:59:51,708
Excuse me, Mr. Dutt.
Is anyone sitting here?

746
00:59:52,667 --> 00:59:55,500
Yes... my wife.

747
01:00:18,167 --> 01:00:20,625
<i>Sanju, you'll be a film star!</i>

748
01:00:22,458 --> 01:00:25,000
<i>Dad worries a lot about you.</i>

749
01:00:25,125 --> 01:00:28,000
<i>I've been offered a Hollywood film.</i>

750
01:00:28,167 --> 01:00:30,917
<i>At your wedding, I'll dance on the table.</i>

751
01:00:36,083 --> 01:00:37,333
Sanju.

752
01:00:45,958 --> 01:00:47,125
What happened?

753
01:00:48,375 --> 01:00:50,958
Mom opened her eyes before she died.

754
01:00:51,917 --> 01:00:55,208
She touched my head to bless me.

755
01:00:59,292 --> 01:01:02,417
Not sure if it happened
or I was hallucinating...

756
01:01:03,083 --> 01:01:04,875
I'm a mess, Dad.

757
01:01:05,167 --> 01:01:08,333
I can't tell what's real
and what's imaginary.

758
01:01:11,708 --> 01:01:12,958
Are you real, Dad?

759
01:01:15,625 --> 01:01:16,750
Buddy, listen.

760
01:01:16,917 --> 01:01:18,750
Is that Mr. Sunil Dutt?

761
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:21,917
- Is dad there?
- Yes.

762
01:01:23,917 --> 01:01:25,208
Please save me, Dad.

763
01:01:25,375 --> 01:01:26,542
I want to quit drugs.

764
01:01:26,708 --> 01:01:28,167
I want to live.

765
01:01:32,375 --> 01:01:35,500
You'll be fine, sonny.

766
01:01:42,083 --> 01:01:43,958
<i>Dad got me to America for treatment.</i>

767
01:01:47,458 --> 01:01:51,875
<i>I was given a list.</i>

768
01:01:58,542 --> 01:02:00,958
<i>He was shocked that I was still alive.</i>

769
01:02:10,042 --> 01:02:12,042
<i>My treatment started.</i>

770
01:02:15,833 --> 01:02:18,417
<i>As the drugs stopped, my body rebelled.</i>

771
01:02:18,750 --> 01:02:20,667
<i>A storm unleashed within.</i>

772
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,792
<i>Often I shivered as if inside an ice slab.</i>

773
01:02:23,917 --> 01:02:26,042
<i>Biting cold I couldn't bear.</i>

774
01:02:27,750 --> 01:02:30,083
<i>Often my body was ablaze.</i>

775
01:02:30,250 --> 01:02:31,750
<i>I was burning.</i>

776
01:02:33,292 --> 01:02:34,917
<i>Bombs exploded in my head.</i>

777
01:02:35,042 --> 01:02:37,750
<i>My pulse would spike up to 150.</i>

778
01:02:37,958 --> 01:02:39,917
<i>My hands would tremor.</i>

779
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,667
<i>Depression, anxiety... I couldn't bear it.</i>

780
01:03:02,083 --> 01:03:04,625
<i>I couldn't take it. I ran away.</i>

781
01:03:05,125 --> 01:03:06,833
<i>I was desperate for drugs.</i>

782
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,958
<i>The only person who'd lend me money</i>

783
01:03:31,083 --> 01:03:34,375
<i>was 1500 miles away, in New York.</i>

784
01:03:38,375 --> 01:03:42,250
<i>Like a madman,
I took off for New York... on foot.</i>

785
01:04:14,750 --> 01:04:17,125
<i>I realized the power of attire.</i>

786
01:04:17,333 --> 01:04:19,583
<i>When the clothes were clean, I got rides.</i>

787
01:04:20,167 --> 01:04:23,417
<i>When dirty, I got alms.</i>

788
01:04:29,667 --> 01:04:31,458
<i>Both served well.</i>

789
01:04:33,708 --> 01:04:36,500
<i>A few days of begging
earned me a bus ticket.</i>

790
01:04:36,625 --> 01:04:39,792
<i>In 12 days, I was in New York.</i>

791
01:04:58,750 --> 01:05:00,708
I'll have one drink and go back.

792
01:05:02,208 --> 01:05:03,792
Never had a drink with you.

793
01:05:04,625 --> 01:05:08,375
Just one and I'll go away.

794
01:05:46,375 --> 01:05:48,583
When your mom was in hospital,

795
01:05:48,792 --> 01:05:52,250
she'd send these recordings.

796
01:05:52,750 --> 01:05:54,208
Ever listened to them?

797
01:06:00,583 --> 01:06:03,167
<i>Silly piglet, how are you?</i>

798
01:06:04,458 --> 01:06:07,833
<i>Remember, when angry,
I'd call you "piglet"?</i>

799
01:06:08,917 --> 01:06:12,708
<i>And you'd say, "Why are you
calling your husband names?"</i>

800
01:06:12,875 --> 01:06:16,333
<i>"If I'm a piglet, my father's the swine!"</i>

801
01:06:18,167 --> 01:06:20,583
<i>Hello, Sanju. This is Mr. Swine.</i>

802
01:06:20,750 --> 01:06:23,750
<i>- Working hard?
- Don't worry about me.</i>

803
01:06:24,083 --> 01:06:26,542
<i>I won't die before I see your film.</i>

804
01:06:26,792 --> 01:06:29,500
<i>I'm by your side. Steadfast!</i>

805
01:06:29,583 --> 01:06:31,375
<i>Like a Master said,</i>

806
01:06:31,667 --> 01:06:35,417
<i>Wherever you go</i>

807
01:06:35,958 --> 01:06:39,625
<i>My shadow will follow</i>

808
01:06:39,750 --> 01:06:42,833
<i>Tell him your theory of the Masters.</i>

809
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:46,542
<i>Before the movies, I was a radio jockey.</i>

810
01:06:46,917 --> 01:06:51,208
<i>I encountered thousands of songs
with beautiful, deep verses.</i>

811
01:06:51,458 --> 01:06:53,875
<i>I accepted those songwriters
as my Masters.</i>

812
01:06:53,958 --> 01:06:58,333
<i>When in trouble, I say,
"Guide me, O Master."</i>

813
01:06:58,417 --> 01:07:01,000
<i>And a song comes to rescue.</i>

814
01:07:01,083 --> 01:07:04,625
<i>So which Master can help Sanju?</i>

815
01:07:05,167 --> 01:07:06,750
Majrooh Sultanpuri.

816
01:07:06,833 --> 01:07:09,708
<i>Presenting from Sloan Hospital...</i>

817
01:07:10,417 --> 01:07:11,833
<i>Water, please.</i>

818
01:07:13,083 --> 01:07:14,792
Dad, it's the tape.

819
01:07:18,208 --> 01:07:21,250
<i>Here's some water. Please rest.</i>

820
01:07:21,333 --> 01:07:23,333
<i>What about the song?</i>

821
01:07:23,458 --> 01:07:27,125
<i>Tomorrow, I promise! Rest now.</i>

822
01:07:30,583 --> 01:07:31,917
Which song was it, Dad?

823
01:07:35,083 --> 01:07:38,333
<i>Don't you ever stop</i>

824
01:07:39,083 --> 01:07:41,333
<i>With your head hung in despair</i>

825
01:07:42,708 --> 01:07:45,583
<i>After this woeful walk over thorns</i>

826
01:07:45,667 --> 01:07:48,792
<i>You will enjoy
The embrace of blossoms</i>

827
01:07:49,917 --> 01:07:52,750
<i>Wanderer,
O wanderer</i>

828
01:07:55,208 --> 01:07:57,042
<i>O Wanderer</i>

829
01:08:03,958 --> 01:08:10,083
<i>Break every shackle</i>

830
01:08:13,958 --> 01:08:19,167
<i>Smith each into</i>

831
01:08:20,875 --> 01:08:24,458
<i>A sword</i>

832
01:08:26,042 --> 01:08:31,708
<i>Fight every battle</i>

833
01:08:32,917 --> 01:08:37,917
<i>Conquer every peak</i>

834
01:08:49,875 --> 01:08:52,083
<i>You may be shattered</i>

835
01:08:52,708 --> 01:08:55,458
<i>Show them you ain't battered</i>

836
01:08:55,583 --> 01:08:59,625
<i>Hope still simmers in your soul!</i>

837
01:09:01,167 --> 01:09:03,417
<i>When your spirit you wield</i>

838
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,708
<i>The heavens will yield</i>

839
01:09:06,875 --> 01:09:10,917
<i>Lead you unfettered to your goal</i>

840
01:09:12,333 --> 01:09:14,625
<i>If by miseries you're hunted</i>

841
01:09:15,125 --> 01:09:17,500
<i>If your weapons are blunted</i>

842
01:09:17,958 --> 01:09:22,625
<i>Stop failure's advances
With those broken lances</i>

843
01:09:22,708 --> 01:09:25,000
<i>Climb every mountain</i>

844
01:09:25,708 --> 01:09:28,167
<i>Conquer every peak</i>

845
01:09:28,458 --> 01:09:31,333
<i>Strive, do not bow down</i>

846
01:09:31,958 --> 01:09:34,000
<i>Attain what you seek!</i>

847
01:09:34,208 --> 01:09:36,625
<i>Climb every mountain</i>

848
01:09:37,042 --> 01:09:39,458
<i>Conquer every peak</i>

849
01:09:39,875 --> 01:09:42,875
<i>Strive, do not bow down</i>

850
01:09:42,958 --> 01:09:45,458
<i>Attain what you seek!</i>

851
01:10:02,500 --> 01:10:05,375
<i>Take by the scruff of the neck</i>

852
01:10:05,458 --> 01:10:08,583
<i>The dark clouds of misery</i>

853
01:10:08,792 --> 01:10:13,208
<i>Rattle them till they reveal
The abode of Victory</i>

854
01:10:13,583 --> 01:10:16,792
<i>With the stars you'll be crowned</i>

855
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,958
<i>The sky, your playground</i>

856
01:10:20,083 --> 01:10:25,000
<i>Break away from the herd</i>

857
01:10:25,333 --> 01:10:30,583
<i>Fortune will be yours
That so far frowned</i>

858
01:10:31,333 --> 01:10:35,417
<i>Stop failure's advances
With those broken lances</i>

859
01:10:39,042 --> 01:10:41,417
<i>Climb every mountain</i>

860
01:10:41,917 --> 01:10:44,333
<i>Conquer every peak</i>

861
01:10:44,708 --> 01:10:48,042
<i>Strive, do not bow down</i>

862
01:10:48,125 --> 01:10:50,125
<i>Attain what you seek!</i>

863
01:10:50,208 --> 01:10:52,833
<i>Climb every mountain</i>

864
01:10:53,250 --> 01:10:55,708
<i>Conquer every peak</i>

865
01:10:56,167 --> 01:10:58,917
<i>Strive, do not bow down</i>

866
01:10:59,208 --> 01:11:01,542
<i>Attain what you seek!</i>

867
01:11:02,083 --> 01:11:07,125
<i>Attain what you seek!</i>

868
01:11:07,208 --> 01:11:13,333
<i>Attain what you seek!</i>

869
01:11:19,333 --> 01:11:25,667
<i>Fight every battle</i>

870
01:11:27,042 --> 01:11:32,167
<i>Conquer every peak</i>

871
01:11:35,833 --> 01:11:38,375
He's off drugs for 18 months.

872
01:11:38,917 --> 01:11:42,917
Wear sunglasses,
our boy is glowing like a floodlight.

873
01:11:44,792 --> 01:11:50,125
As your Sex-spear says,
"All's well that ends well."

874
01:11:51,750 --> 01:11:54,750
Take the bags. The taximeter's on.

875
01:11:55,333 --> 01:11:56,833
Hurry up.

876
01:11:57,792 --> 01:11:59,000
It's not "the end" yet.

877
01:11:59,083 --> 01:12:02,208
<i>The doctor warned, he could relapse.</i>

878
01:12:02,292 --> 01:12:05,458
If he starts again, he'll die.

879
01:12:06,167 --> 01:12:08,833
Please keep him away from bad company.

880
01:12:09,417 --> 01:12:10,792
Thank you, son.

881
01:12:28,667 --> 01:12:32,333
Dad, you carry on. I'll join you.

882
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,250
For how long can we stop him?

883
01:12:40,625 --> 01:12:44,708
Now he must fight his own battles.
Let's go.

884
01:12:45,167 --> 01:12:47,083
I thought you wouldn't meet me.

885
01:12:47,708 --> 01:12:49,375
How could I not?

886
01:12:49,583 --> 01:12:53,000
I thought of you every day
the past 18 months.

887
01:12:56,042 --> 01:12:58,542
I have a special welcome-back gift.

888
01:12:58,708 --> 01:13:02,042
Haven't seen such fine stuff in 18 years.

889
01:13:02,583 --> 01:13:05,125
Just to celebrate your return.

890
01:13:05,292 --> 01:13:09,750
Normally, I don't share
such exclusive stuff with anyone.

891
01:13:11,458 --> 01:13:12,833
To your health.

892
01:13:18,042 --> 01:13:20,250
Bro, that's my dose. It's potent.

893
01:13:20,542 --> 01:13:22,000
Too strong for you.

894
01:13:22,333 --> 01:13:24,958
Doesn't such potent stuff
ruin your health?

895
01:13:26,417 --> 01:13:28,708
Your parents must've
gifted you strong genes.

896
01:13:28,833 --> 01:13:30,333
How are they?

897
01:13:30,417 --> 01:13:33,667
They're fine... by the grace of God.

898
01:13:33,958 --> 01:13:36,417
Amazing!
They're reborn after the car crash?

899
01:13:44,875 --> 01:13:47,833
Glucose powder suits me fine.

900
01:13:48,792 --> 01:13:49,875
Now try that!

901
01:13:57,708 --> 01:13:59,375
I cracked it!

902
01:13:59,458 --> 01:14:02,750
You took glucose and fed me drugs.

903
01:14:04,042 --> 01:14:06,750
You aren't an addict, you're a peddler!

904
01:14:07,125 --> 01:14:09,458
Posed as a friend for my money.

905
01:14:13,292 --> 01:14:16,000
Bro, I'll return your money.

906
01:14:16,083 --> 01:14:17,833
Great idea!

907
01:14:17,917 --> 01:14:21,167
Return those five years
which I was too numb to feel.

908
01:14:23,208 --> 01:14:27,000
My father hasn't slept in five years.
Return that lost sleep.

909
01:14:28,125 --> 01:14:31,333
I lost Ruby. Can you get her back?

910
01:14:31,708 --> 01:14:34,667
My sisters stopped smiling.
Return that smile.

911
01:14:34,750 --> 01:14:36,917
Can you? You peddler!

912
01:15:05,708 --> 01:15:08,250
My real gods.

913
01:15:09,250 --> 01:15:10,125
And one more.

914
01:15:13,625 --> 01:15:15,417
Lord Ganesha, MD.

915
01:15:16,333 --> 01:15:18,250
He's lived with me in prison, too.

916
01:15:24,250 --> 01:15:25,417
You're crying?

917
01:15:26,708 --> 01:15:28,083
Was the story so bad?

918
01:15:30,167 --> 01:15:31,875
Will you write it?

919
01:15:44,458 --> 01:15:46,000
We'll continue then.

920
01:15:49,458 --> 01:15:52,458
Winnie, do you have a boyfriend?

921
01:15:53,208 --> 01:15:56,125
- Yes. Why?
- Tell him, he's very lucky.

922
01:15:56,708 --> 01:15:58,750
'Cause I'm intelligent and good looking?

923
01:16:00,083 --> 01:16:02,458
- 'Cause I'm going to prison.
- Stop it.

924
01:16:03,625 --> 01:16:05,667
When he's happy he blabbers.

925
01:16:26,875 --> 01:16:29,583
So, you met the terrorist.

926
01:16:29,667 --> 01:16:33,375
Also figured why you're
desperate to stop me.

927
01:16:33,958 --> 01:16:37,708
Once a drug-peddler, now a big builder.

928
01:16:41,042 --> 01:16:43,208
Even his lies seem true.

929
01:16:43,583 --> 01:16:49,458
Ask him why his best friend, Kamlesh,
hasn't spoken to him in 20 years.

930
01:16:50,458 --> 01:16:52,083
Ask him.

931
01:17:22,500 --> 01:17:25,083
I'm writing a book
on your friend, Sanjay Dutt.

932
01:17:26,875 --> 01:17:28,292
He's not my friend.

933
01:17:31,417 --> 01:17:35,458
But he says, "Kamli is my best friend."

934
01:17:37,750 --> 01:17:38,708
In a past life.

935
01:17:40,333 --> 01:17:46,292
Then in this life, why are you
glued to the TV watching his news?

936
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:45,917
- You called from India?
- Right. And you hung up.

937
01:18:46,125 --> 01:18:47,167
So, I'm here.

938
01:18:48,458 --> 01:18:52,625
Look, I promise, I won't even
mention you in the book.

939
01:18:56,625 --> 01:18:58,833
- Shall we sit somewhere?
- Sure.

940
01:18:59,542 --> 01:19:01,917
I know a great place.

941
01:19:04,917 --> 01:19:05,833
Where?

942
01:19:08,792 --> 01:19:10,208
Follow Aunt Annie.

943
01:19:17,250 --> 01:19:18,708
Remember this place?

944
01:19:42,417 --> 01:19:46,375
He loves you. Why did you cut off ties?

945
01:19:48,458 --> 01:19:50,542
Do you know what RDX is?

946
01:19:52,708 --> 01:19:55,042
It was used in the Mumbai bomb blasts.

947
01:19:55,125 --> 01:19:56,875
And where was it stored?

948
01:19:58,458 --> 01:20:00,875
In a truck parked at Sanjay Dutt's house.

949
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,917
He knew Mumbai would be bombed,
but kept mum.

950
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:08,292
- Who told you?
- The man who loved him the most.

951
01:20:08,750 --> 01:20:09,708
Who?

952
01:20:10,625 --> 01:20:13,125
Sunil Dutt... his father.

953
01:20:35,625 --> 01:20:37,375
Tell me your side of the story.

954
01:20:37,458 --> 01:20:39,542
If he's a terrorist, I'll scrap the book.

955
01:20:39,708 --> 01:20:42,583
I flew 12000 km just to meet you.

956
01:20:42,667 --> 01:20:45,625
And I wasted 12 years of my life with him.

957
01:20:45,958 --> 01:20:47,208
No more time for him.

958
01:20:47,292 --> 01:20:49,375
He's the one with no time.
He's off to prison.

959
01:20:49,458 --> 01:20:51,250
Know what he's taking along?

960
01:21:04,417 --> 01:21:06,792
This story has four characters.

961
01:21:06,917 --> 01:21:08,750
Sanjay Dutt, Sunil Dutt,

962
01:21:08,833 --> 01:21:11,583
I, and the Babri mosque.

963
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:17,000
Babri mosque was demolished
on 6th December, 1992.

964
01:21:17,833 --> 01:21:19,292
Riots burned the country.

965
01:21:21,042 --> 01:21:23,542
<i>Mr. Dutt was then a Member of Parliament.</i>

966
01:21:23,708 --> 01:21:25,125
<i>He'd stopped making films.</i>

967
01:21:25,208 --> 01:21:27,375
<i>All his time was spent serving people.</i>

968
01:21:28,083 --> 01:21:30,292
<i>When riots erupted in his constituency</i>

969
01:21:30,375 --> 01:21:34,083
<i>and Muslim homes were burnt,
he plunged into relief work.</i>

970
01:21:35,292 --> 01:21:38,125
<i>And his son, unconcerned,
lived in his own world.</i>

971
01:21:45,417 --> 01:21:50,583
<i>He was no longer the drug-addict.</i>

972
01:21:50,667 --> 01:21:55,000
<i>He reigned as an A-list film star
those 12 years.</i>

973
01:21:55,375 --> 01:21:58,458
<i>As for me... my IT business
was prospering.</i>

974
01:21:58,708 --> 01:22:01,542
<i>I made tons of money.
But had one grouse...</i>

975
01:22:02,042 --> 01:22:03,833
<i>I was still a virgin.</i>

976
01:22:03,917 --> 01:22:07,208
<i>Then I met a girl, Pinky.</i>

977
01:22:07,292 --> 01:22:12,958
<i>I flew every weekend to Mumbai,
hoping to get lucky.</i>

978
01:22:15,750 --> 01:22:18,875
<i>The result... I was jetlagged 24/7.</i>

979
01:22:19,333 --> 01:22:21,792
Still on the runway? Not taken off?

980
01:22:21,875 --> 01:22:23,958
Sir, we've landed.

981
01:22:24,042 --> 01:22:24,875
Landed?

982
01:22:24,958 --> 01:22:27,792
<i>This time, Sanju had
invited Pinky for dinner.</i>

983
01:22:28,500 --> 01:22:32,500
<i>The mission was to make sure I score.</i>

984
01:22:38,208 --> 01:22:39,750
Pinky loves pink.

985
01:22:39,833 --> 01:22:42,333
She asked for a pink t-shirt.

986
01:22:42,417 --> 01:22:44,833
So you bought the store?

987
01:22:44,958 --> 01:22:45,792
Superb!

988
01:22:48,833 --> 01:22:51,333
Control... You're drinking too much.

989
01:22:51,708 --> 01:22:53,958
Need courage to open my account.

990
01:22:54,750 --> 01:22:56,542
Account! Which bank?

991
01:22:56,667 --> 01:23:00,667
My aunt's cousin is a banker.
You'll be done in a jiffy.

992
01:23:00,958 --> 01:23:03,708
- You need an account, too?
- No, I have many accounts.

993
01:23:12,750 --> 01:23:14,500
What's all this?

994
01:23:15,167 --> 01:23:16,667
All for you.

995
01:23:18,750 --> 01:23:21,917
This pink t-shirt, sweater,

996
01:23:23,750 --> 01:23:24,917
lin-jer-ree...

997
01:23:27,792 --> 01:23:32,333
This pink nightie, just for you! Try it.

998
01:23:32,542 --> 01:23:37,542
No, I'll stick to the t-shirt.

999
01:23:43,333 --> 01:23:44,458
One moment.

1000
01:23:46,333 --> 01:23:48,667
Do you know why
nighties are called nighties?

1001
01:23:49,500 --> 01:23:50,417
Why?

1002
01:23:51,375 --> 01:23:53,625
'Cause they are worn at night.

1003
01:23:55,167 --> 01:24:00,125
Scriptures say,
hour and attire must match.

1004
01:24:15,750 --> 01:24:18,083
I've got her in the nightie.

1005
01:24:18,458 --> 01:24:20,958
- Your job is to get her out of it.
- Done!

1006
01:24:22,583 --> 01:24:26,417
Don't overdrink,
or there'll be no bam-bam.

1007
01:24:27,875 --> 01:24:31,125
I'm out of here. Freshen up.

1008
01:24:31,292 --> 01:24:32,417
I'll change, too.

1009
01:24:57,292 --> 01:25:00,833
<i>On a journey to the moon</i>

1010
01:25:02,333 --> 01:25:06,083
<i>Let's dance, let's swoon</i>

1011
01:25:07,167 --> 01:25:10,750
<i>It's one night's delight</i>

1012
01:25:12,167 --> 01:25:14,917
<i>Then our paths will divide</i>

1013
01:25:16,667 --> 01:25:20,375
<i>On a journey to the moon</i>

1014
01:25:21,667 --> 01:25:25,250
<i>Let's dance, let's swoon</i>

1015
01:25:26,458 --> 01:25:29,833
<i>Just one night's delight</i>

1016
01:25:31,292 --> 01:25:34,500
<i>Come, set me alight</i>

1017
01:25:35,083 --> 01:25:36,375
Kamli...

1018
01:25:41,375 --> 01:25:44,375
Kamli, wake up.

1019
01:25:44,542 --> 01:25:45,667
Get up.

1020
01:25:46,958 --> 01:25:48,958
Time for bam-bam.

1021
01:25:49,167 --> 01:25:50,542
Wake up. You're a tiger.

1022
01:25:50,833 --> 01:25:52,958
Roar!

1023
01:25:53,333 --> 01:25:54,292
Come on.

1024
01:26:09,917 --> 01:26:14,458
<i>You are no saint</i>

1025
01:26:14,792 --> 01:26:18,833
<i>Nor am I</i>

1026
01:26:19,667 --> 01:26:24,208
<i>It's one night's delight</i>

1027
01:26:24,500 --> 01:26:28,625
<i>Let's not be uptight</i>

1028
01:26:32,625 --> 01:26:36,917
<i>On a journey to the moon</i>

1029
01:26:37,708 --> 01:26:42,000
<i>Let's dance, let's swoon</i>

1030
01:26:42,583 --> 01:26:46,792
<i>Just one night's delight</i>

1031
01:26:47,333 --> 01:26:51,292
<i>Come, set me alight</i>

1032
01:27:06,458 --> 01:27:08,708
Baby, you ready?

1033
01:27:08,792 --> 01:27:10,333
Have breakfast, Kamli.

1034
01:27:10,667 --> 01:27:13,292
- You're meeting some girls today.
- I have a girlfriend.

1035
01:27:13,375 --> 01:27:16,292
Forget her. She's a floozy.

1036
01:27:16,375 --> 01:27:19,542
- Shush... she'll hear you.
- She's gone.

1037
01:27:20,083 --> 01:27:22,667
You were very irresponsible last night!

1038
01:27:23,042 --> 01:27:25,625
You passed out and I had to bam-bam...

1039
01:27:25,958 --> 01:27:28,458
and then wrap up your pink store.

1040
01:27:29,875 --> 01:27:32,417
Chill, I'll set it up
for the next attempt.

1041
01:27:32,500 --> 01:27:35,292
Tell me you're lying.

1042
01:27:36,333 --> 01:27:40,042
I was checking her loyalty towards you.

1043
01:27:40,375 --> 01:27:44,833
I held her hand,
she rubbed it with her thumb.

1044
01:27:45,167 --> 01:27:47,875
That's all she does.

1045
01:27:48,208 --> 01:27:50,458
Never goes further.

1046
01:27:51,458 --> 01:27:53,125
With me, she went further, bro.

1047
01:27:54,125 --> 01:27:56,500
I said, "Nightie."

1048
01:27:59,375 --> 01:28:00,667
She took it off?

1049
01:28:07,167 --> 01:28:09,167
It was clear,
she can't be my sister-in-law.

1050
01:28:10,083 --> 01:28:11,875
No one cheats on my best friend!

1051
01:28:12,792 --> 01:28:16,125
It was guilt-free bam-bam.
What's her name?

1052
01:28:16,708 --> 01:28:18,625
You slept with her
and don't know her name?

1053
01:28:18,708 --> 01:28:20,875
Name after the game? Bad manners!

1054
01:28:20,958 --> 01:28:23,083
You swine!

1055
01:28:24,333 --> 01:28:27,667
I've unveiled her true colors.

1056
01:28:27,750 --> 01:28:30,458
You should be grateful.

1057
01:28:31,708 --> 01:28:32,875
<i>Hey, Sanju.</i>

1058
01:28:33,375 --> 01:28:35,875
<i>Your pop's buddying up to the Muslims.</i>

1059
01:28:36,208 --> 01:28:38,333
- Drill sense into him.
- Who the hell...?

1060
01:28:38,417 --> 01:28:40,958
<i>You half-Muslim!</i>

1061
01:28:41,042 --> 01:28:44,292
<i>Your sister is sizzling hot.
Shall I get her raped?</i>

1062
01:28:44,583 --> 01:28:45,458
Hey!

1063
01:28:47,667 --> 01:28:50,542
<i>It's a stone. Could've been a grenade.</i>

1064
01:28:50,875 --> 01:28:54,500
<i>Your pop's loading trucks
with relief material, right?</i>

1065
01:28:54,917 --> 01:28:59,167
<i>- I'll bump him off.
- Hello!</i>

1066
01:29:14,375 --> 01:29:17,083
- Let's get out of here.
- We've got a threat call.

1067
01:29:17,292 --> 01:29:20,125
You wake up late. I've already got five.

1068
01:29:20,333 --> 01:29:22,208
Barking dogs seldom bite.

1069
01:29:22,333 --> 01:29:24,542
Out here you can be shot.

1070
01:29:24,625 --> 01:29:25,708
We'll shield him.

1071
01:29:26,375 --> 01:29:28,083
We'll take the bullet.

1072
01:29:28,167 --> 01:29:32,083
We'll defend Mr. Dutt
till our last breath.

1073
01:29:32,167 --> 01:29:34,167
With that toy? Does it even work?

1074
01:29:34,250 --> 01:29:36,083
Yes, it does.

1075
01:29:41,958 --> 01:29:44,625
When did you last fire it? World War II?

1076
01:29:45,042 --> 01:29:46,500
Stop it, Sanju.

1077
01:29:46,583 --> 01:29:48,375
Hurry, load the truck.

1078
01:29:48,708 --> 01:29:50,958
Reason with dad. He never listens to me.

1079
01:29:51,083 --> 01:29:54,208
Look at him, and then at yourself.

1080
01:29:54,292 --> 01:29:55,833
He helps strangers.

1081
01:29:55,917 --> 01:29:59,167
While you bam-bam your best friend's girl.

1082
01:30:21,458 --> 01:30:24,500
<i>Hey, Kamli, remember the strip club?</i>

1083
01:30:25,250 --> 01:30:27,917
I lost out on a chick for your jacket.

1084
01:30:28,417 --> 01:30:31,875
<i>Remember, you owed me a blonde.</i>

1085
01:30:32,292 --> 01:30:34,833
Let's say Pinky is the blonde,
and we're square!

1086
01:30:36,042 --> 01:30:38,083
<i>I'm in New York on the 22nd.</i>

1087
01:30:38,167 --> 01:30:40,083
I'll wait outside the same club.

1088
01:30:41,917 --> 01:30:43,000
Wear that red jacket

1089
01:30:43,708 --> 01:30:45,958
<i>and I'll know you've forgiven me.</i>

1090
01:30:49,125 --> 01:30:50,667
Kamli, please forgive me.

1091
01:30:53,625 --> 01:30:54,500
Kamli...

1092
01:30:58,375 --> 01:31:04,042
<i>They say, "Life is what happens
when you're making other plans."</i>

1093
01:31:04,375 --> 01:31:09,042
<i>While he was planning his trip,
life had other plans.</i>

1094
01:31:30,375 --> 01:31:32,625
<i>Twelve bombs exploded that day.</i>

1095
01:31:32,708 --> 01:31:35,667
<i>250 people died. 800 were injured.</i>

1096
01:31:35,750 --> 01:31:38,250
<i>Police investigations revealed a name...</i>

1097
01:31:38,667 --> 01:31:40,000
<i>Tiger Memon.</i>

1098
01:31:40,583 --> 01:31:43,167
<i>In the riots following
the Babri mosque demolition,</i>

1099
01:31:43,250 --> 01:31:46,750
<i>Tiger Memon's office was burnt down.
He struck back.</i>

1100
01:31:47,708 --> 01:31:51,000
<i>As the truth unfolded, many were arrested.</i>

1101
01:31:52,583 --> 01:31:55,000
Kamlesh, read the news?

1102
01:31:57,333 --> 01:31:58,250
No. Why?

1103
01:31:58,333 --> 01:32:00,708
Your friend was involved
in the Bombay bomb blasts.

1104
01:32:01,625 --> 01:32:02,875
He's been arrested.

1105
01:32:02,958 --> 01:32:05,333
He had an AK-56 rifle.

1106
01:32:09,333 --> 01:32:12,292
Did you possess an AK-56 rifle?

1107
01:32:12,708 --> 01:32:13,667
No, sir.

1108
01:32:21,708 --> 01:32:25,667
Did you possess an AK-56?

1109
01:32:26,083 --> 01:32:27,333
I'll tell you, sir.

1110
01:32:27,875 --> 01:32:29,625
I'll tell you everything...

1111
01:32:30,375 --> 01:32:32,000
but please don't tell dad.

1112
01:32:43,042 --> 01:32:44,958
- Babu?
- Kamli.

1113
01:32:46,458 --> 01:32:49,875
I knew you'd come.

1114
01:32:50,292 --> 01:32:51,542
I'm glad.

1115
01:32:52,167 --> 01:32:56,125
Sir, I'm sure the AK-56 charges are bogus.

1116
01:33:00,500 --> 01:33:03,167
- Here's Sanju's confession.
- Read it.

1117
01:33:12,333 --> 01:33:15,458
Dad would send relief material
to riot victims.

1118
01:33:15,917 --> 01:33:17,417
Majority of them were Muslims.

1119
01:33:19,250 --> 01:33:21,458
Some people didn't approve.

1120
01:33:22,292 --> 01:33:23,875
They thought dad was pro-Muslim.

1121
01:33:25,542 --> 01:33:27,125
That's when the threats started...

1122
01:33:28,458 --> 01:33:31,375
to murder us and rape my sisters.

1123
01:33:32,208 --> 01:33:33,500
I was terrified.

1124
01:33:34,208 --> 01:33:37,708
Then there were two attacks on dad.

1125
01:33:38,167 --> 01:33:40,750
I requested special protection,
but was denied.

1126
01:33:41,667 --> 01:33:44,500
I feared a mob attack any time.

1127
01:33:45,958 --> 01:33:49,125
Hanif and Samir, producers of my film...

1128
01:33:50,042 --> 01:33:54,125
suggested I keep... an assault rifle,
for protection.

1129
01:34:04,333 --> 01:34:08,208
<i>In January, Samir, Hanif,
and Salem came home.</i>

1130
01:34:36,833 --> 01:34:40,000
<i>They gave me three rifles
and some bullets,</i>

1131
01:34:40,083 --> 01:34:42,208
<i>which I kept in my car.</i>

1132
01:34:45,542 --> 01:34:47,125
<i>Soon, I panicked.</i>

1133
01:34:48,458 --> 01:34:52,625
I'll keep only one rifle
till the riots end.

1134
01:34:52,750 --> 01:34:54,875
Please take away the rest.

1135
01:34:55,500 --> 01:34:57,083
<i>They came back two days later.</i>

1136
01:34:57,583 --> 01:35:02,292
<i>I returned two rifles.
Kept one rifle and 250 bullets.</i>

1137
01:35:04,333 --> 01:35:07,708
<i>On 2nd April, I went to Mauritius
for a film shoot.</i>

1138
01:35:08,250 --> 01:35:11,417
<i>I got news of Hanif and Samir's arrest.</i>

1139
01:35:11,750 --> 01:35:15,625
<i>I feared they'd rat me out.</i>

1140
01:35:16,542 --> 01:35:18,625
<i>I called my friend, Yusuf Nulwala.</i>

1141
01:35:19,542 --> 01:35:22,500
Yusuf, go to my house.

1142
01:35:23,583 --> 01:35:25,250
<i>Go to my room.</i>

1143
01:35:25,833 --> 01:35:28,000
<i>You'll find a black bag.</i>

1144
01:35:30,792 --> 01:35:33,125
<i>There's some stuff in it.</i>

1145
01:35:33,542 --> 01:35:35,083
<i>Destroy it.</i>

1146
01:35:50,042 --> 01:35:51,542
<i>Then one day, dad called.</i>

1147
01:35:52,458 --> 01:35:56,125
The papers say,
you possess an AK-56 rifle.

1148
01:35:56,667 --> 01:35:58,333
AK-56? No, Dad!

1149
01:35:58,500 --> 01:36:01,083
I've got you a meeting
with the Police Commissioner.

1150
01:36:01,208 --> 01:36:02,333
Come to Bombay.

1151
01:36:03,708 --> 01:36:06,875
<i>Dad informed the cops about my arrival,</i>

1152
01:36:07,125 --> 01:36:11,125
<i>and assured them he'll get me
to the police station.</i>

1153
01:36:11,250 --> 01:36:12,542
<i>But...</i>

1154
01:36:16,667 --> 01:36:17,833
Mr. Sanjay Dutt.

1155
01:36:25,792 --> 01:36:27,833
Deliver the luggage to his father.

1156
01:36:28,958 --> 01:36:30,083
Come with me.

1157
01:36:30,250 --> 01:36:32,083
- What's the problem, officer?
- Come.

1158
01:36:33,333 --> 01:36:34,667
Sir, what happened?

1159
01:36:36,500 --> 01:36:37,750
Get in.

1160
01:36:48,625 --> 01:36:51,708
Last time, we won the fight against drugs.

1161
01:36:52,833 --> 01:36:57,750
But this time...
the battle will be tougher.

1162
01:36:59,292 --> 01:37:02,875
- I'll need you, son.
- I'm not going anywhere, sir.

1163
01:37:03,583 --> 01:37:06,083
The "snakes" are in the "hole."

1164
01:37:06,583 --> 01:37:07,792
Grab a bite.

1165
01:37:09,375 --> 01:37:11,042
Sleep in Sanju's room.

1166
01:37:12,375 --> 01:37:13,875
I'll be here for a while.

1167
01:37:19,625 --> 01:37:20,750
Switch off the fan.

1168
01:37:21,375 --> 01:37:23,000
Sir, it's hot.

1169
01:37:25,208 --> 01:37:27,583
He sleeps without a fan, too.

1170
01:37:52,833 --> 01:37:54,708
<i>For security reasons,</i>

1171
01:37:54,792 --> 01:38:00,167
<i>Sanju was kept in isolation
in a windowless cell.</i>

1172
01:38:00,792 --> 01:38:04,208
<i>His only companions were ants.</i>

1173
01:38:04,458 --> 01:38:07,250
It's been seven days, soldiers.

1174
01:38:07,958 --> 01:38:09,500
When will I get bail?

1175
01:38:13,083 --> 01:38:14,708
Tell me.

1176
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:17,083
Please...

1177
01:38:37,625 --> 01:38:39,625
Sir, the pot is overflowing.

1178
01:38:40,458 --> 01:38:41,708
Sir.

1179
01:38:47,333 --> 01:38:48,292
Please help!

1180
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:54,167
Help!

1181
01:39:02,208 --> 01:39:06,875
<i>He suffered inside prison
and his dad, outside.</i>

1182
01:39:10,125 --> 01:39:11,667
Look, the terrorist's pop.

1183
01:39:32,875 --> 01:39:33,792
Come.

1184
01:39:37,708 --> 01:39:39,125
Give him a shave.

1185
01:39:41,333 --> 01:39:43,667
You're done.

1186
01:39:44,250 --> 01:39:46,167
Come, wash your face.

1187
01:39:47,500 --> 01:39:48,417
You speak English!

1188
01:39:48,958 --> 01:39:52,000
I've done my Masters. Even had a bank job.

1189
01:39:53,208 --> 01:39:54,667
How'd you land here?

1190
01:39:55,292 --> 01:39:57,000
My wife cheated on me.

1191
01:39:57,875 --> 01:39:58,917
I killed her!

1192
01:39:59,792 --> 01:40:01,625
Chopped her into pieces,

1193
01:40:01,708 --> 01:40:05,917
stuffed her in a bag
and left it on a long distance train.

1194
01:40:06,875 --> 01:40:07,917
A porter saw me,

1195
01:40:08,375 --> 01:40:09,833
and here I am.

1196
01:40:10,375 --> 01:40:13,292
- I'll skip the shave.
- Why?

1197
01:40:13,583 --> 01:40:16,500
Need a beard for my next film.

1198
01:40:16,792 --> 01:40:19,750
I'm playing Santa Claus.
He had a big beard.

1199
01:40:20,042 --> 01:40:23,583
I've to let it grow.

1200
01:40:25,292 --> 01:40:27,833
Hello! This is Sunil Dutt.

1201
01:40:28,625 --> 01:40:29,583
A moment.

1202
01:40:30,042 --> 01:40:31,292
Mr. Dutt.

1203
01:40:33,417 --> 01:40:35,125
Sir, the minister's bathing.

1204
01:40:35,583 --> 01:40:39,958
Morning, noon and evening?

1205
01:40:40,500 --> 01:40:41,750
He's always in the bath!

1206
01:40:41,833 --> 01:40:44,500
Health reasons, sir.

1207
01:40:44,917 --> 01:40:48,750
He has a fungal infection on his thigh.

1208
01:40:49,958 --> 01:40:51,792
I'll pass on your message.

1209
01:40:53,917 --> 01:40:55,875
<i>Everyone avoided Mr. Dutt.</i>

1210
01:40:56,042 --> 01:41:00,500
<i>Terror charges being stigmatic,
no one wanted any involvement.</i>

1211
01:41:01,792 --> 01:41:07,417
Partner, we've been roomies for 180 days.

1212
01:41:08,792 --> 01:41:11,250
That's longer than any girl
I've been with.

1213
01:41:13,333 --> 01:41:17,083
Supreme Court will hear
my bail petition today.

1214
01:41:18,208 --> 01:41:20,792
Which means I'm a free bird.

1215
01:41:24,792 --> 01:41:26,625
I'll miss you.

1216
01:41:27,917 --> 01:41:31,000
- Your bail's been rejected.
- What?

1217
01:41:31,167 --> 01:41:34,333
Bail is always tough in the Terror Act.

1218
01:41:34,875 --> 01:41:36,375
Sir...

1219
01:42:15,792 --> 01:42:18,167
Dad, what's up with my bail?

1220
01:42:18,292 --> 01:42:22,208
Don't worry, sonny.
We're going to the Supreme Court.

1221
01:42:22,542 --> 01:42:23,375
You get better.

1222
01:42:23,958 --> 01:42:27,167
Why are you lying?

1223
01:42:28,583 --> 01:42:32,750
I know my bail's rejected.
I've been in for six months.

1224
01:42:32,833 --> 01:42:35,667
You know the Prime Minister...
the President... speak to them.

1225
01:42:35,750 --> 01:42:39,625
What have I done?
Killed anyone? Fire a bullet?

1226
01:42:40,292 --> 01:42:42,167
Just kept a gun, for your protection!

1227
01:42:42,625 --> 01:42:44,042
My protection?

1228
01:42:46,083 --> 01:42:50,542
I'd rather you shot me with that gun!

1229
01:42:57,792 --> 01:42:59,000
He'll never appreciate me.

1230
01:43:00,708 --> 01:43:05,667
Praises my sisters all the time...
"Ace! Well played!"

1231
01:43:07,500 --> 01:43:09,167
I want to die.

1232
01:43:09,667 --> 01:43:10,500
Please help me.

1233
01:43:17,083 --> 01:43:18,583
There's cyanide in the tea.

1234
01:43:21,792 --> 01:43:22,708
Drink up.

1235
01:43:29,167 --> 01:43:30,458
Vodka in the tea?

1236
01:43:30,542 --> 01:43:32,875
Now chill! Don't blabber about dying.

1237
01:43:32,958 --> 01:43:34,375
Think of your dad!

1238
01:43:34,792 --> 01:43:36,917
He strives from dawn to dusk
for your bail.

1239
01:43:37,083 --> 01:43:40,875
Begs lawyers, politicians, cops...

1240
01:43:41,333 --> 01:43:44,458
Sleeps on the floor
'cause you have no bed.

1241
01:43:44,792 --> 01:43:47,042
Doesn't use the fan
'cause you don't have one.

1242
01:43:47,125 --> 01:43:50,875
People call him, "Terrorist's pop."

1243
01:43:51,875 --> 01:43:54,917
You've twisted his twins,
now spare him your suicide!

1244
01:43:55,417 --> 01:43:57,792
Fight! You'll definitely get bail.

1245
01:44:06,792 --> 01:44:08,083
Once out of prison...

1246
01:44:08,917 --> 01:44:10,875
get a sexy girlfriend.

1247
01:44:11,625 --> 01:44:15,167
I'll get you drunk and bam-bam her!

1248
01:44:15,750 --> 01:44:17,250
Then, we're even.

1249
01:44:19,167 --> 01:44:22,583
"I want to die." Enough! You're a tiger.

1250
01:44:23,208 --> 01:44:25,958
"Rorr"... come on.

1251
01:44:26,500 --> 01:44:27,917
"Rorr!"

1252
01:44:37,125 --> 01:44:39,167
<i>He spent 452 days in prison.</i>

1253
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,375
<i>The Supreme Court finally
granted him bail.</i>

1254
01:44:43,125 --> 01:44:45,500
<i>But his name was now
synonymous with the word...</i>

1255
01:44:48,625 --> 01:44:51,167
<i>The public and the press hated him.</i>

1256
01:44:51,833 --> 01:44:55,542
<i>He was being tried under the Terror Act...</i>

1257
01:44:55,875 --> 01:44:58,167
<i>he feared his bail would be canceled.</i>

1258
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:02,208
<i>His only hope was political intervention.</i>

1259
01:45:02,708 --> 01:45:06,708
<i>An influential minister in the capital
agreed to meet him.</i>

1260
01:45:07,125 --> 01:45:08,000
Hello, sir.

1261
01:45:09,125 --> 01:45:12,500
Come... sit.

1262
01:45:13,250 --> 01:45:14,792
How's daddy?

1263
01:45:15,458 --> 01:45:16,500
He has a fever.

1264
01:45:16,583 --> 01:45:18,375
Very good...

1265
01:45:19,792 --> 01:45:21,625
What brings you here?

1266
01:45:22,583 --> 01:45:23,917
Sir, I'll be honest.

1267
01:45:25,125 --> 01:45:26,167
I did possess a gun.

1268
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:29,417
I should be tried under the Arms Act.

1269
01:45:30,125 --> 01:45:32,333
But they've slapped me
with the Terror Act.

1270
01:45:33,708 --> 01:45:36,625
If I was involved in the bomb blasts,

1271
01:45:36,833 --> 01:45:38,292
would I return to India?

1272
01:45:38,792 --> 01:45:41,000
I could've run away from Mauritius.

1273
01:45:41,542 --> 01:45:43,375
Taken asylum in another country.

1274
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:55,292
- He's dozed off!
- Speak louder.

1275
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:01,875
Sir, I got a gun because
I feared a mob attack.

1276
01:46:06,792 --> 01:46:10,625
<i>If the minister really slept
or play acted to avoid us</i>

1277
01:46:10,708 --> 01:46:12,625
<i>is still a mystery.</i>

1278
01:46:17,583 --> 01:46:18,667
How's daddy?

1279
01:46:20,375 --> 01:46:23,375
- He has a fever.
- Very good...

1280
01:46:25,125 --> 01:46:26,625
What brings you here?

1281
01:46:28,208 --> 01:46:31,292
Our legs brought us here...
we'll go back swimming.

1282
01:46:31,375 --> 01:46:33,833
Very good...

1283
01:46:34,042 --> 01:46:36,292
Let me know if I can help.

1284
01:46:36,875 --> 01:46:39,000
<i>It was evident, we were on our own.</i>

1285
01:46:39,792 --> 01:46:42,917
<i>I decided that until Sanju was cleared
of terror charges,</i>

1286
01:46:43,250 --> 01:46:46,708
<i>I'd be by his side. But the next day...</i>

1287
01:46:54,792 --> 01:46:55,833
Babu, where's Sanju?

1288
01:46:56,500 --> 01:46:57,750
In the preview theatre.

1289
01:47:08,542 --> 01:47:10,667
No one goes in. Mr. Dutt's orders.

1290
01:47:10,750 --> 01:47:16,833
Tell the Court, you knew about
the bomb blast conspiracy.

1291
01:47:19,625 --> 01:47:20,792
Kamlesh,

1292
01:47:21,125 --> 01:47:22,375
please wait outside.

1293
01:47:38,042 --> 01:47:39,042
Where are you going?

1294
01:47:39,875 --> 01:47:42,333
FBI raided my office.

1295
01:47:43,083 --> 01:47:44,083
Why?

1296
01:47:49,542 --> 01:47:51,750
What's that got to do with the FBI?

1297
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:55,750
My company works with
the American government.

1298
01:47:56,083 --> 01:47:58,333
Now they'll investigate our association.

1299
01:47:58,958 --> 01:48:00,917
Terror charges freak them out.

1300
01:48:04,208 --> 01:48:05,208
Sorry, buddy.

1301
01:48:06,250 --> 01:48:08,000
I've put you through all this...

1302
01:48:09,625 --> 01:48:14,000
- Call me when you get there.
- No... my phone will be tapped.

1303
01:48:15,833 --> 01:48:18,208
We must disconnect for a few years.

1304
01:48:20,958 --> 01:48:23,958
Don't worry. I understand. Go...

1305
01:48:25,583 --> 01:48:27,792
Hey, Kamli. You're a tiger.

1306
01:48:36,250 --> 01:48:37,458
Let's go.

1307
01:48:47,875 --> 01:48:50,250
First time ever I lied to Sanju.

1308
01:48:50,333 --> 01:48:52,125
I can be friends with an addict.

1309
01:48:52,917 --> 01:48:58,667
Even with a guy who slept with my girl.
But with a terrorist? I'm no fool!

1310
01:49:01,292 --> 01:49:04,167
Every time I drink, I miss him...

1311
01:49:04,792 --> 01:49:06,208
yearn to call him.

1312
01:49:07,625 --> 01:49:09,500
Then I remind myself...

1313
01:49:10,417 --> 01:49:13,708
there was a truck full of RDX
at his house.

1314
01:49:13,792 --> 01:49:15,583
He's a bloody terrorist!

1315
01:49:17,708 --> 01:49:18,958
Are we done?

1316
01:49:22,833 --> 01:49:23,958
<i>Mail from Winnie.</i>

1317
01:49:24,500 --> 01:49:25,625
Where's she?

1318
01:49:26,708 --> 01:49:27,542
America.

1319
01:49:28,917 --> 01:49:30,083
She won't write the book.

1320
01:49:33,583 --> 01:49:36,208
<i>Sanjay Dutt was given 30 days
to surrender.</i>

1321
01:49:36,375 --> 01:49:37,708
<i>That time is over.</i>

1322
01:49:37,875 --> 01:49:42,125
<i>He's on his way to prison.</i>

1323
01:49:42,708 --> 01:49:43,667
<i>Clothes off.</i>

1324
01:49:44,667 --> 01:49:45,833
Raise your hands.

1325
01:49:48,667 --> 01:49:49,875
Turn.

1326
01:49:54,042 --> 01:49:55,042
Bend.

1327
01:49:57,625 --> 01:49:58,792
Cough.

1328
01:49:59,375 --> 01:50:00,542
Harder.

1329
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,958
You dropped Sanju's story
for a book on museums?

1330
01:50:45,500 --> 01:50:49,125
- Museums don't lie.
- Nor did Sanju.

1331
01:50:49,500 --> 01:50:53,375
But a news report
became your gospel truth.

1332
01:50:55,958 --> 01:50:56,958
What's this?

1333
01:50:57,625 --> 01:51:00,917
Prison has a community radio
for prisoners' reform.

1334
01:51:01,333 --> 01:51:03,750
Sanju hosts a show.

1335
01:51:04,250 --> 01:51:06,667
He wants you to hear this episode.

1336
01:51:06,875 --> 01:51:08,417
Took great pains to smuggle it out.

1337
01:51:12,917 --> 01:51:14,125
My number.

1338
01:51:14,458 --> 01:51:16,458
You'll need it after you're done.

1339
01:51:30,833 --> 01:51:33,125
<i>Howdy, Yerwada!</i>

1340
01:51:33,208 --> 01:51:37,750
This is your buddy, Sanju!

1341
01:51:41,792 --> 01:51:46,292
Today's topic is "newspapers."

1342
01:51:46,958 --> 01:51:50,000
There were no newspapers 400 years ago.

1343
01:51:50,333 --> 01:51:52,125
News traveled word of mouth.

1344
01:51:52,208 --> 01:51:54,375
<i>Then, someone printed the first newspaper.</i>

1345
01:51:54,500 --> 01:51:57,833
<i>Soon, selling news became big business.</i>

1346
01:51:58,208 --> 01:52:04,750
Today, India has 105,437
registered publications,

1347
01:52:05,208 --> 01:52:08,333
thousands of radio stations,
TV channels and the internet.

1348
01:52:09,042 --> 01:52:11,583
And they're in a rat race...

1349
01:52:12,500 --> 01:52:14,625
fighting for readership.

1350
01:52:15,042 --> 01:52:18,333
More readers means more money from ads.

1351
01:52:19,417 --> 01:52:23,458
And how do you lure readers?
With the truth?

1352
01:52:24,833 --> 01:52:25,750
No.

1353
01:52:26,542 --> 01:52:29,417
With news that's spicy!

1354
01:52:30,500 --> 01:52:33,417
And how do you do that?

1355
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:35,875
Easy! With a question mark.

1356
01:52:38,583 --> 01:52:44,583
When I was on bail,
these question marks were on my tail.

1357
01:52:44,667 --> 01:52:46,333
SANJU IN A BRAWL?

1358
01:52:51,292 --> 01:52:53,083
SANJU SOZZLED?

1359
01:52:56,208 --> 01:52:59,833
<i>Dad decided to fight back.</i>

1360
01:52:59,917 --> 01:53:02,625
Mr. Dutt, what a surprise!

1361
01:53:02,708 --> 01:53:04,750
How many pages does your paper have?

1362
01:53:05,667 --> 01:53:07,625
- Twenty four.
- Cut it down to eight.

1363
01:53:08,667 --> 01:53:11,667
Then you won't need
fake news to fill pages.

1364
01:53:12,333 --> 01:53:13,667
Please come.

1365
01:53:15,667 --> 01:53:20,917
If our reportage bothers you, sue us.

1366
01:53:22,542 --> 01:53:24,458
How can I fight you?

1367
01:53:24,542 --> 01:53:26,167
You have James Bond with you.

1368
01:53:27,042 --> 01:53:27,958
James Bond?

1369
01:53:28,042 --> 01:53:31,042
James Bond has a license to kill.

1370
01:53:31,333 --> 01:53:34,208
He has legal immunity.

1371
01:53:34,417 --> 01:53:37,083
Similarly, you have these question marks.

1372
01:53:37,417 --> 01:53:40,250
In Court, you'll state,
"This isn't confirmed news."

1373
01:53:40,333 --> 01:53:43,667
"Just speculation.
Don't miss the question mark."

1374
01:53:43,750 --> 01:53:45,500
"According to sources..."

1375
01:53:48,708 --> 01:53:50,917
These are your James Bond!

1376
01:53:56,708 --> 01:54:00,917
<i>Bandu Boss, I'll be there. Tell me when.</i>

1377
01:54:01,083 --> 01:54:04,167
<i>Last day of Ganesha festival.</i>

1378
01:54:04,500 --> 01:54:06,000
<i>Done.</i>

1379
01:54:08,208 --> 01:54:12,833
Your son graces events by gangsters.

1380
01:54:13,500 --> 01:54:16,417
Cops have 60 such phone taps.

1381
01:54:16,833 --> 01:54:20,333
He's not focused on work.
His last 12 films tanked.

1382
01:54:20,833 --> 01:54:26,417
His bail can be revoked.
In short, he's finished!

1383
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:30,750
Then state that with conviction.

1384
01:54:31,875 --> 01:54:35,083
Put a full stop. Not a question mark.

1385
01:54:49,542 --> 01:54:53,583
Mr. Editor, don't write his obituary yet.

1386
01:54:53,667 --> 01:54:55,583
My son will rise again.

1387
01:54:56,208 --> 01:54:59,375
I'll prove you wrong.

1388
01:54:59,708 --> 01:55:01,875
I'm around, and so are you.

1389
01:55:02,042 --> 01:55:03,250
We'll meet again.

1390
01:55:08,875 --> 01:55:13,917
<i>A lousy editor writing me off
was unacceptable to dad.</i>

1391
01:55:14,500 --> 01:55:18,625
<i>He resolved to get my life back on track.</i>

1392
01:55:18,792 --> 01:55:23,167
If you hobnob with gangsters,
won't the press hound you?

1393
01:55:23,833 --> 01:55:25,250
Gangster? Who, Dad?

1394
01:55:27,708 --> 01:55:28,958
Bandu Boss.

1395
01:55:30,042 --> 01:55:32,042
Aren't you attending his event?

1396
01:55:33,833 --> 01:55:37,292
What's the option? They're dangerous.

1397
01:55:38,167 --> 01:55:39,375
Don't go.

1398
01:55:39,708 --> 01:55:42,833
They'll kill me. They shot Gulshan Kumar.

1399
01:55:43,083 --> 01:55:46,000
- Fired at Rakesh Roshan.
- Don't go, sonny.

1400
01:55:46,375 --> 01:55:50,125
If the snoopy press
ensures my safety, I won't go.

1401
01:56:11,333 --> 01:56:12,583
Why are we here, Dad?

1402
01:56:12,667 --> 01:56:15,792
When I was to marry your mom,

1403
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:21,042
a notorious don... Mastan, got livid.

1404
01:56:21,833 --> 01:56:24,625
"Nargis is the pride
of the Muslim community."

1405
01:56:25,292 --> 01:56:28,292
"If a Hindu marries her,
we'll slaughter him."

1406
01:56:28,792 --> 01:56:30,875
I called him and said...

1407
01:56:32,042 --> 01:56:35,542
"Let's meet and talk."

1408
01:56:35,708 --> 01:56:40,500
He agreed. 1 a.m... right here.

1409
01:56:41,917 --> 01:56:44,583
- You came here alone?
- No.

1410
01:56:45,083 --> 01:56:47,000
My Master was with me.

1411
01:56:47,542 --> 01:56:49,875
- Which one?
- Sahir Ludhianvi.

1412
01:56:50,458 --> 01:56:53,458
I reached an hour earlier.

1413
01:56:53,875 --> 01:56:57,500
I let Sahir's song
play in my mind on loop.

1414
01:56:58,125 --> 01:57:03,958
When the don arrived,
I said, "I love Nargis deeply."

1415
01:57:04,792 --> 01:57:06,333
"I want to marry her."

1416
01:57:06,833 --> 01:57:09,083
"And I'll keep her happy forever."

1417
01:57:09,583 --> 01:57:13,500
"If to love someone is wrong, shoot me."

1418
01:57:13,792 --> 01:57:16,917
"If right, give me a hug."

1419
01:57:17,500 --> 01:57:18,958
On our wedding day,

1420
01:57:19,333 --> 01:57:21,542
the biggest bouquet...

1421
01:57:22,958 --> 01:57:24,042
came from Mastan!

1422
01:57:26,625 --> 01:57:29,583
- What song was it, Dad?
- Will you sing it?

1423
01:57:30,625 --> 01:57:32,625
Sing along with me.

1424
01:57:35,250 --> 01:57:38,875
<i>Vicious or vile, let no power</i>

1425
01:57:38,958 --> 01:57:41,500
<i>Ever let you cower</i>

1426
01:57:41,708 --> 01:57:45,000
- Dad, not here.
- Come on, catch the beat.

1427
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:49,667
<i>Vicious or vile, let no power</i>

1428
01:57:49,792 --> 01:57:52,667
<i>Ever let you cower</i>

1429
01:57:53,292 --> 01:58:00,292
<i>Look evil in the eye
Your head held high</i>

1430
01:58:00,792 --> 01:58:07,583
<i>So what if this be your last breath?</i>

1431
01:58:08,375 --> 01:58:15,083
<i>Rejoice, you never died before your death!</i>

1432
01:58:24,208 --> 01:58:30,500
Sonny, go... let Bandu Boss have it.

1433
01:58:30,917 --> 01:58:32,750
He'll never call again.

1434
01:58:32,833 --> 01:58:36,583
<i>Break</i>

1435
01:58:36,667 --> 01:58:40,542
<i>Every shackle</i>

1436
01:58:42,625 --> 01:58:48,542
<i>Smith each into</i>

1437
01:58:49,500 --> 01:58:53,000
<i>A sword</i>

1438
01:58:54,375 --> 01:58:55,417
Stop!

1439
01:58:59,750 --> 01:59:00,958
Hey, the great Sanju!

1440
01:59:01,083 --> 01:59:03,125
Boss, look who's here.

1441
01:59:04,708 --> 01:59:06,042
The star!

1442
01:59:06,667 --> 01:59:08,417
Welcome!

1443
01:59:09,125 --> 01:59:12,625
No calendar at home?
You're ten days early!

1444
01:59:12,708 --> 01:59:16,500
Welcome... sit.

1445
01:59:20,292 --> 01:59:22,667
May I speak in private?

1446
01:59:22,750 --> 01:59:23,917
In private?

1447
01:59:24,500 --> 01:59:26,333
They're family.

1448
01:59:27,792 --> 01:59:29,292
Close your ears.

1449
01:59:31,333 --> 01:59:35,458
We reject condoms
and eject large families.

1450
01:59:36,583 --> 01:59:38,417
Now tell me.

1451
01:59:41,042 --> 01:59:43,083
I can't attend the Ganesha festival.

1452
01:59:45,333 --> 01:59:46,917
Are you sloshed?

1453
01:59:47,333 --> 01:59:49,417
I've already announced to the world.

1454
01:59:49,542 --> 01:59:51,625
My parents are joining, too.

1455
01:59:51,750 --> 01:59:54,417
I too have a father. He disapproves.

1456
01:59:57,042 --> 01:59:59,250
He approves when you meet
the gangs in Dubai?

1457
02:00:00,333 --> 02:00:03,167
Did I have a choice? I was scared.

1458
02:00:05,458 --> 02:00:07,417
You ain't scared of me?

1459
02:00:08,542 --> 02:00:10,583
Boys, show him fear.

1460
02:00:32,292 --> 02:00:34,625
Wanna see your brains?

1461
02:00:37,792 --> 02:00:40,875
Blow them out, but first... hear me out.

1462
02:00:42,500 --> 02:00:47,542
If I attend your event,
the press will print...

1463
02:00:47,833 --> 02:00:49,000
"Sanju-Gangsters Romance."

1464
02:00:49,542 --> 02:00:53,750
If I don't attend, "Gang kills Sanju."

1465
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:56,042
Either ways, it'll make headlines.

1466
02:00:56,250 --> 02:01:00,250
But, the second headline
won't shame my dad.

1467
02:01:00,833 --> 02:01:02,458
He'll cry gallons.

1468
02:01:03,083 --> 02:01:06,792
But when he faces the world,
his head will be held high.

1469
02:01:07,458 --> 02:01:09,167
Not bowed down in shame.

1470
02:01:11,375 --> 02:01:14,875
If this makes sense... fine.

1471
02:01:18,208 --> 02:01:19,333
If not, shoot me.

1472
02:01:22,875 --> 02:01:25,042
- Boss...
- Shut up!

1473
02:01:31,250 --> 02:01:32,625
I'll leave now.

1474
02:01:33,417 --> 02:01:35,708
If I've overstepped, I'm sorry.

1475
02:01:59,583 --> 02:02:02,583
<i>Bandu Boss never called.</i>

1476
02:02:03,667 --> 02:02:05,417
<i>But he showed up!</i>

1477
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:13,917
It's a family tradition.

1478
02:02:14,333 --> 02:02:16,625
No murders during the Ganesha fest.

1479
02:02:17,292 --> 02:02:19,250
Decided to kill you after the fest.

1480
02:02:19,708 --> 02:02:21,708
These ten days, I only thought of you.

1481
02:02:22,292 --> 02:02:26,292
You risked life to keep
your dad's head unbowed.

1482
02:02:26,708 --> 02:02:29,792
Who does such a stupid thing?

1483
02:02:29,875 --> 02:02:33,000
Head, a few degrees up or down,
what bloody difference?

1484
02:02:35,292 --> 02:02:37,667
I prayed to the Lord for you.

1485
02:02:38,042 --> 02:02:40,500
Told him, "He's one gutsy guy."

1486
02:02:40,750 --> 02:02:44,292
"Help him. Get his charges dropped."

1487
02:02:44,708 --> 02:02:46,792
The Lord said, "Bandu Boss, done!"

1488
02:02:47,917 --> 02:02:49,125
Here are the offerings.

1489
02:02:52,875 --> 02:02:54,458
Success guaranteed!

1490
02:02:54,667 --> 02:02:56,500
- Lord Ganesha...
- Glory be thine!

1491
02:02:56,625 --> 02:02:58,417
Be thine!

1492
02:02:59,167 --> 02:03:00,833
Stay in touch.

1493
02:03:01,042 --> 02:03:02,042
Let's go.

1494
02:03:08,417 --> 02:03:12,083
Get Bandu Boss teary-eyed often.

1495
02:03:12,250 --> 02:03:14,208
Free sweets will follow.

1496
02:03:15,333 --> 02:03:16,500
Sir, it's the director.

1497
02:03:20,292 --> 02:03:21,625
Yes, bro.

1498
02:03:21,708 --> 02:03:23,500
Where are you? We are ready to shoot.

1499
02:03:23,583 --> 02:03:26,917
Insane traffic on the highway.

1500
02:03:27,708 --> 02:03:29,750
A truck hit a car.

1501
02:03:32,083 --> 02:03:35,458
Hey, move that taxi.

1502
02:03:36,208 --> 02:03:37,625
Listen.

1503
02:03:37,875 --> 02:03:39,292
I've called the landline.

1504
02:03:42,792 --> 02:03:44,542
Landline's for all and sundry.

1505
02:03:44,625 --> 02:03:46,583
You're my bro, always call on my cell.

1506
02:03:46,667 --> 02:03:49,250
We missed the sunrise shot.

1507
02:03:49,667 --> 02:03:52,208
Shoot it at sunset.

1508
02:03:52,333 --> 02:03:54,292
The audience won't know shit.

1509
02:03:54,375 --> 02:03:57,625
<i>Now hang up or we'll miss the sunset.</i>

1510
02:03:59,083 --> 02:04:02,292
Time to introduce you to Master no. 2.

1511
02:04:03,583 --> 02:04:06,917
He'll teach you to respect work.

1512
02:04:07,292 --> 02:04:09,667
If you keep missing sunrise shoots,

1513
02:04:09,750 --> 02:04:12,208
the sun will set on your career.

1514
02:04:12,458 --> 02:04:15,333
Do good work and the press
will change its opinion, too.

1515
02:04:16,125 --> 02:04:17,792
Good work?

1516
02:04:18,125 --> 02:04:19,542
With such trashy scripts.

1517
02:04:21,500 --> 02:04:22,917
Here...

1518
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:27,667
Kinky King, Rowdy Romeo...

1519
02:04:28,292 --> 02:04:31,708
Munnabhai MBBS, Punky Prince...

1520
02:04:31,792 --> 02:04:33,667
Aamir and Shah Rukh grab the best.

1521
02:04:34,042 --> 02:04:37,958
- Do you read these scripts?
- Cover to cover.

1522
02:04:38,083 --> 02:04:41,000
All read and rejected.

1523
02:04:41,458 --> 02:04:44,250
"Munnabhai MBBS." Read this one?

1524
02:04:44,375 --> 02:04:46,792
- I did.
- What's the story?

1525
02:04:49,292 --> 02:04:50,708
It's trash!

1526
02:04:52,208 --> 02:04:54,583
There's a hospital...

1527
02:04:54,708 --> 02:04:59,125
where a patient gets murdered...
every day!

1528
02:04:59,708 --> 02:05:03,583
Then kidneys are stolen.
It's a horror story.

1529
02:05:03,833 --> 02:05:05,417
I need a family film.

1530
02:05:05,708 --> 02:05:09,083
The draft I read has no murders.

1531
02:05:10,292 --> 02:05:15,500
- Why did you read it?
- I'm playing your father in this film.

1532
02:05:16,083 --> 02:05:19,583
I'll set up Master no. 2 in your car.

1533
02:05:19,667 --> 02:05:23,500
Listen to the song on loop at full volume.

1534
02:05:31,375 --> 02:05:34,292
<i>If you shirk from work</i>

1535
02:05:36,833 --> 02:05:39,875
<i>You get no perk, you jerk</i>

1536
02:05:39,958 --> 02:05:41,708
Turn it off!

1537
02:05:41,792 --> 02:05:44,667
It's Mr. Dutt's order to play this song
the whole month.

1538
02:05:44,750 --> 02:05:48,250
And check that you lip sync.

1539
02:05:54,708 --> 02:05:56,917
<i>If you shirk from work</i>

1540
02:05:57,000 --> 02:05:58,375
I am singing.

1541
02:05:59,583 --> 02:06:02,250
<i>You get no perk, you jerk</i>

1542
02:06:02,708 --> 02:06:05,292
<i>If duties you duck
You land up in muck</i>

1543
02:06:05,583 --> 02:06:08,250
<i>On bankruptcy's brink
Not a dime for a drink</i>

1544
02:06:08,417 --> 02:06:11,417
<i>Toil hard buddy
Listen to your daddy...</i>

1545
02:06:11,875 --> 02:06:13,833
- Lip sync fine?
- Yes.

1546
02:06:13,917 --> 02:06:16,792
Report to dad. Bloody snitch!

1547
02:06:20,458 --> 02:06:23,500
<i>Dad signed this film after a 12 year gap</i>

1548
02:06:23,667 --> 02:06:26,125
<i>just to discipline me.</i>

1549
02:06:26,250 --> 02:06:30,750
Must an ER patient fill an admit form?

1550
02:06:35,625 --> 02:06:37,583
<i>He was always punctual on the sets.</i>

1551
02:06:37,750 --> 02:06:40,042
- Has the hero arrived?
- Yes, sir.

1552
02:06:40,625 --> 02:06:43,750
<i>So I too, had to be on time.</i>

1553
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:49,208
Shall we rehearse?

1554
02:06:55,500 --> 02:06:57,000
Just for the shot, Dad!

1555
02:06:58,292 --> 02:07:00,917
Hey, pal. No fear, I'm here.

1556
02:07:03,250 --> 02:07:07,208
You lied to me shamelessly for ten years.

1557
02:07:12,708 --> 02:07:17,083
"Now that your father's proud,
why'd you fret?"

1558
02:07:17,292 --> 02:07:20,750
That's my dialogue.
I'm playing the father.

1559
02:07:21,292 --> 02:07:23,167
But, Father...
I couldn't become a doctor."

1560
02:07:23,250 --> 02:07:24,167
Again.

1561
02:07:24,708 --> 02:07:28,250
You lied to me shamelessly for 10 years.

1562
02:07:28,792 --> 02:07:32,583
Now that your father's proud,
why'd you fret?

1563
02:07:32,750 --> 02:07:33,750
Once again?

1564
02:07:33,917 --> 02:07:37,708
<i>Prison time was easier than this.</i>

1565
02:07:37,833 --> 02:07:40,042
<i>Dad's discipline roasted me.</i>

1566
02:07:41,042 --> 02:07:44,875
<i>But, I won't ever forget
that "magic hug" scene.</i>

1567
02:07:45,125 --> 02:07:47,417
Your mom gets a thousand hugs.

1568
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:50,917
Spare one for dad.

1569
02:07:56,250 --> 02:07:59,542
<i>Neither of us heard it
when the director called, "Cut!"</i>

1570
02:07:59,833 --> 02:08:01,750
<i>We were weeping.</i>

1571
02:08:02,125 --> 02:08:04,833
<i>It was a lifetime since we had hugged.</i>

1572
02:08:13,417 --> 02:08:15,667
...Sanjay Dutt for "Munnabhai MBBS."

1573
02:08:20,542 --> 02:08:21,583
Go on, sonny.

1574
02:08:35,667 --> 02:08:38,750
Mr. Dutt, didn't I tell you
that Sanju will be back!

1575
02:08:39,125 --> 02:08:41,375
Really? Did you?

1576
02:08:41,458 --> 02:08:42,708
Didn't I?

1577
02:08:43,833 --> 02:08:46,542
- I told... someone.
- Who?

1578
02:08:46,708 --> 02:08:48,625
Our Associate Editor.

1579
02:08:48,875 --> 02:08:51,250
Told him to print, "Sanju will be back."

1580
02:08:51,333 --> 02:08:53,667
He must've forgotten.

1581
02:08:53,917 --> 02:08:57,208
Make it tomorrow's headline...
"Sanjay Dutt is back."

1582
02:08:59,917 --> 02:09:02,083
Without a question mark.

1583
02:09:11,125 --> 02:09:12,792
Look, Munnabhai's pop!

1584
02:09:21,792 --> 02:09:23,375
<i>Look, the terrorist's pop!</i>

1585
02:09:27,417 --> 02:09:28,458
What happened, Dad?

1586
02:09:28,542 --> 02:09:33,417
It's the second time
you've made me cry with joy.

1587
02:09:34,750 --> 02:09:39,208
<i>The first time dad cried with joy
was in our preview theater.</i>

1588
02:09:39,583 --> 02:09:43,917
<i>That day a headline read,
"RDX truck at Dutt house."</i>

1589
02:09:55,958 --> 02:10:01,542
<i>Tell the judge that you knew about
the bomb blast conspiracy.</i>

1590
02:10:07,958 --> 02:10:12,583
<i>The first time dad cried with joy
was in our preview theater.</i>

1591
02:10:12,833 --> 02:10:17,042
<i>That day a headline read,
"RDX truck at Dutt house."</i>

1592
02:10:17,375 --> 02:10:20,000
<i>But that's another episode.</i>

1593
02:10:20,208 --> 02:10:21,458
<i>I'll save it for another day.</i>

1594
02:10:21,708 --> 02:10:24,000
<i>Let's get back to dad.</i>

1595
02:10:24,125 --> 02:10:26,542
<i>I got another chance to make dad happy.</i>

1596
02:10:28,500 --> 02:10:31,000
<i>Dad was being honored
at a Consulate dinner.</i>

1597
02:10:32,292 --> 02:10:34,917
You guys never praise me.

1598
02:10:35,292 --> 02:10:37,458
So, here I am as chief guest.

1599
02:10:37,667 --> 02:10:41,958
<i>Dad was unaware, his son would
sing his praises tonight!</i>

1600
02:10:42,042 --> 02:10:46,042
<i>I was to make the introduction speech.</i>

1601
02:10:58,000 --> 02:10:59,167
Dad, I'll be back.

1602
02:11:00,500 --> 02:11:02,583
Sir, there's a minor problem.

1603
02:11:02,792 --> 02:11:06,750
Today's headline said, "Blast suspect
to attend diplomatic event."

1604
02:11:07,667 --> 02:11:12,000
The Embassy wanted you off the guest list.

1605
02:11:12,458 --> 02:11:15,625
We said, "That would be rude."

1606
02:11:16,292 --> 02:11:19,208
"We'll seat him away from the diplomats."

1607
02:11:32,125 --> 02:11:34,292
My speech... When's that?

1608
02:11:55,208 --> 02:11:57,833
Sonny, what's the problem?

1609
02:11:59,042 --> 02:12:02,792
I'm right here. Read out your speech.

1610
02:12:05,292 --> 02:12:06,792
I wanted everyone to hear it.

1611
02:12:12,417 --> 02:12:15,208
Learn to ignore such people.

1612
02:12:15,917 --> 02:12:22,083
Time for Master no. 3.
I'll set the song in your car.

1613
02:12:22,667 --> 02:12:23,708
Anand Bakshi.

1614
02:12:23,792 --> 02:12:28,375
He'll teach you to deal with humiliation.
Okay?

1615
02:12:30,958 --> 02:12:33,333
Sanju...

1616
02:12:38,750 --> 02:12:42,708
Hey, pal. No fear, I'm here!

1617
02:12:44,500 --> 02:12:45,583
Go, sleep.

1618
02:12:50,833 --> 02:12:53,750
<i>Wish I'd read him the speech,</i>

1619
02:12:54,250 --> 02:12:56,833
<i>for... the next morning,
he didn't wake up.</i>

1620
02:14:08,083 --> 02:14:09,958
<i>If life had a rewind button...</i>

1621
02:14:10,667 --> 02:14:13,875
<i>I'd go back and read him the speech!</i>

1622
02:14:20,708 --> 02:14:25,208
Today, I'll try the impossible...
an attempt to thank dad.

1623
02:14:25,667 --> 02:14:28,833
In the past, I never found the words.

1624
02:14:28,917 --> 02:14:33,708
To define what dad's done for me...
every word fell short.

1625
02:14:40,792 --> 02:14:42,708
<i>...a wife dying in the hospital,</i>

1626
02:14:43,292 --> 02:14:45,583
<i>a son destroyed by drugs.</i>

1627
02:14:46,083 --> 02:14:48,458
<i>Dad fought all alone.</i>

1628
02:14:48,917 --> 02:14:51,292
He's the reason I'm alive.

1629
02:14:53,250 --> 02:14:57,000
Tried to thank him then
but couldn't find the words.

1630
02:14:57,375 --> 02:15:00,000
<i>Dad walked long peace marches…</i>

1631
02:15:00,583 --> 02:15:03,417
<i>from Hiroshima to Nagasaki...
Mumbai to Amritsar.</i>

1632
02:15:04,333 --> 02:15:07,000
<i>But none wore off his shoes as much as</i>

1633
02:15:07,458 --> 02:15:09,583
the jostle between courts and cops.

1634
02:15:10,375 --> 02:15:13,375
<i>Legal costs forced dad to sell his house.</i>

1635
02:15:13,542 --> 02:15:15,500
<i>Not once did he complain!</i>

1636
02:15:16,167 --> 02:15:21,917
Wanted to thank him then
but couldn't find the words.

1637
02:15:22,875 --> 02:15:27,333
Now, after a lifetime,
I've found the words.

1638
02:15:31,917 --> 02:15:36,167
You deserved a better son, Dad.

1639
02:15:37,125 --> 02:15:40,625
<i>One who'd support you... not be a burden.</i>

1640
02:15:41,583 --> 02:15:44,750
<i>One known for his honesty,
not his travesties.</i>

1641
02:15:45,333 --> 02:15:48,375
One more like you and less like me.

1642
02:15:54,958 --> 02:15:58,167
That son would've never loved you as much

1643
02:15:58,250 --> 02:16:00,500
as this no-good sonny does!

1644
02:16:01,042 --> 02:16:02,458
<i>I could never say it, but...</i>

1645
02:16:06,083 --> 02:16:07,500
You're my strength,

1646
02:16:08,292 --> 02:16:09,542
<i>my solace,</i>

1647
02:16:10,417 --> 02:16:11,750
my pride.

1648
02:16:11,833 --> 02:16:13,333
You're my world, Dad.

1649
02:16:18,083 --> 02:16:19,333
Love you, sonny.

1650
02:16:29,500 --> 02:16:31,958
<i>Had dad lived another year,</i>

1651
02:16:32,042 --> 02:16:35,208
<i>he'd have witnessed what he yearned for.</i>

1652
02:16:39,417 --> 02:16:42,417
...I do not find you to be a terrorist.

1653
02:16:47,583 --> 02:16:49,500
<i>I was acquitted from the Terror Act.</i>

1654
02:16:49,875 --> 02:16:53,958
<i>I got six years under the Arms Act.</i>

1655
02:16:54,292 --> 02:16:57,292
<i>The judge clearly said
I was not a terrorist.</i>

1656
02:16:57,958 --> 02:16:59,208
<i>But the next morning,</i>

1657
02:16:59,375 --> 02:17:02,958
<i>no headline read "Dutt not a terrorist."</i>

1658
02:17:05,208 --> 02:17:09,542
<i>All said, "Dutt gets
six years in the blast case."</i>

1659
02:17:12,250 --> 02:17:14,500
Till date, I'm branded a terrorist.

1660
02:17:20,625 --> 02:17:25,458
Master no. 3 was to teach me
to deal with insults.

1661
02:17:27,083 --> 02:17:31,292
But with dad's death,
that song remains a mystery.

1662
02:17:32,042 --> 02:17:36,917
If you can crack that song, do tell.

1663
02:17:37,417 --> 02:17:41,667
Until tomorrow,
Sanju says, "Adios, amigos."

1664
02:17:57,333 --> 02:17:58,917
I want to meet Sanju.

1665
02:18:19,292 --> 02:18:20,458
How are you?

1666
02:18:20,708 --> 02:18:23,208
They don't let me step out,
the rest is fine.

1667
02:18:23,333 --> 02:18:27,458
Yeah. Sticklers for rules!
Weren't letting me in, either.

1668
02:18:27,958 --> 02:18:29,958
Missing me? Boyfriend vamoosed?

1669
02:18:32,500 --> 02:18:34,000
I'm no Pinky.

1670
02:18:36,083 --> 02:18:38,792
- You met Kamli?
- Yes.

1671
02:18:38,875 --> 02:18:40,583
In your recording, you say...

1672
02:18:41,333 --> 02:18:46,958
on the day the RDX news appeared,
your dad cried with joy.

1673
02:18:47,042 --> 02:18:48,250
Yes.

1674
02:18:48,333 --> 02:18:49,750
Kamlesh has a different version.

1675
02:18:49,833 --> 02:18:52,333
When he came to the preview theater,

1676
02:18:52,792 --> 02:18:56,250
your dad was urging you
to confess in court

1677
02:18:56,417 --> 02:18:59,250
that you knew about
the bomb blasts conspiracy.

1678
02:19:06,333 --> 02:19:07,417
The moron!

1679
02:19:08,833 --> 02:19:09,917
Get Kamli here.

1680
02:19:11,292 --> 02:19:14,833
- Tell me about it.
- No. I'll tell him directly.

1681
02:19:14,917 --> 02:19:17,667
It's hard to get permission.

1682
02:19:21,667 --> 02:19:24,292
Remember this number, 88.0.

1683
02:19:24,542 --> 02:19:26,292
- What's that?
- A radio frequency.

1684
02:19:26,375 --> 02:19:28,583
There's an FM mic in our studio.

1685
02:19:29,125 --> 02:19:34,500
Park close to the prison walls
and tune in.

1686
02:19:37,667 --> 02:19:38,792
Kamlesh won't come.

1687
02:19:40,375 --> 02:19:45,458
Tell him... 6th June. He won't refuse.

1688
02:19:48,625 --> 02:19:52,708
It's his dad's birthday.
Bloody emotional blackmailer!

1689
02:19:53,250 --> 02:19:54,375
Will you come?

1690
02:20:28,917 --> 02:20:31,000
<i>Howdy, Yerwada!</i>

1691
02:20:31,125 --> 02:20:35,208
<i>This is your buddy, Sanju!</i>

1692
02:20:38,708 --> 02:20:41,667
Today's topic is "friendship."

1693
02:20:42,083 --> 02:20:44,208
My best friend was Kamli.

1694
02:20:45,125 --> 02:20:49,042
Great guy. But fell prey to drugs.

1695
02:20:49,917 --> 02:20:52,833
<i>No... not the psychotropic drugs.</i>

1696
02:20:53,250 --> 02:20:59,833
But the ones that are slid
under our doors, daily.

1697
02:21:00,667 --> 02:21:02,833
<i>We have them with our morning tea.</i>

1698
02:21:03,333 --> 02:21:06,667
Drugs called "News."

1699
02:21:07,542 --> 02:21:09,333
<i>These drugs are sold on TV too.</i>

1700
02:21:09,667 --> 02:21:14,042
Haven't you heard those
cacophonous debates

1701
02:21:14,333 --> 02:21:16,625
that numb our minds?

1702
02:21:17,375 --> 02:21:20,542
Courts take years
to just understand a case.

1703
02:21:20,750 --> 02:21:24,375
But these panelists
pass verdicts in an hour.

1704
02:21:25,000 --> 02:21:26,875
Back then, a headline said...

1705
02:21:32,542 --> 02:21:34,417
<i>It was fake news.</i>

1706
02:21:34,500 --> 02:21:38,167
No cop, no prosecutor,
no witness ever said

1707
02:21:38,250 --> 02:21:40,375
there was a truck with RDX at my house.

1708
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:42,167
<i>So, why this headline?</i>

1709
02:21:42,500 --> 02:21:47,458
During riots, a truck with relief material
was parked at our house.

1710
02:21:49,458 --> 02:21:51,833
<i>Some jerk spread a rumor it had RDX.</i>

1711
02:21:51,917 --> 02:21:54,917
And a journo printed this spicy news.

1712
02:21:55,000 --> 02:21:58,208
Read my Supreme Court judgment.

1713
02:21:58,500 --> 02:22:00,875
I was never accused of possessing RDX!

1714
02:22:02,708 --> 02:22:07,000
But which journo bothers with facts?

1715
02:22:07,250 --> 02:22:10,125
All they want is "Breaking News!"

1716
02:22:12,750 --> 02:22:14,542
This headline worked like a drug.

1717
02:22:15,583 --> 02:22:18,417
In Kamli's head,
I morphed into a terrorist.

1718
02:22:20,667 --> 02:22:23,417
He put a full-stop to our friendship.

1719
02:22:24,458 --> 02:22:28,083
Didn't even notice
that the headline had a question mark!

1720
02:22:38,667 --> 02:22:40,917
<i>This news shattered dad.</i>

1721
02:22:41,333 --> 02:22:44,458
In desperation, he brought in a lawyer.

1722
02:22:45,833 --> 02:22:48,542
- What's this?
- Your ticket to freedom.

1723
02:22:48,833 --> 02:22:50,750
Sign and turn approver.

1724
02:22:50,833 --> 02:22:53,083
- Approver?
- Government witness.

1725
02:22:55,708 --> 02:23:00,458
Tell the Court, you knew about
the bomb blast conspiracy.

1726
02:23:02,250 --> 02:23:04,625
Kamlesh, please wait outside.

1727
02:23:09,000 --> 02:23:12,917
- I knew nothing about the bomb blasts.
- But tell the Court that you knew.

1728
02:23:13,292 --> 02:23:16,292
Tell them who got the RDX,
who made the bombs,

1729
02:23:16,708 --> 02:23:18,083
and who planted them.

1730
02:23:18,167 --> 02:23:22,083
- I know nothing!
- I'll give you the names.

1731
02:23:22,417 --> 02:23:25,625
You help the State with missing links.

1732
02:23:25,708 --> 02:23:30,583
In return, the State
will let you go scot-free.

1733
02:23:31,708 --> 02:23:35,208
- I'll be branded a terrorist.
- You're already branded.

1734
02:23:35,292 --> 02:23:38,042
It's a lie, a sign will make it the truth.

1735
02:23:39,083 --> 02:23:41,208
The country will spit on me.

1736
02:23:42,042 --> 02:23:43,500
Leave the country.

1737
02:23:43,833 --> 02:23:45,417
London, Kenya... Pick a place.

1738
02:23:46,583 --> 02:23:51,542
And dad? My sisters? Dad, heard that?

1739
02:23:51,625 --> 02:23:54,917
Don't worry about us. Leave the country.

1740
02:24:00,667 --> 02:24:04,292
Sir, I don't have a law degree.

1741
02:24:05,042 --> 02:24:06,875
In fact, I'm a college dropout.

1742
02:24:07,125 --> 02:24:10,083
But I know, this is rotten advice.

1743
02:24:10,750 --> 02:24:13,958
I brand him "Terrorist's pop"
and run away?

1744
02:24:14,583 --> 02:24:16,208
People will hate dad.

1745
02:24:16,417 --> 02:24:19,833
His life's work, respect...
All down the drain!

1746
02:24:19,917 --> 02:24:22,417
- Listen to me...
- You listen to me.

1747
02:24:22,500 --> 02:24:25,750
Get lost!
You might be a great lawyer,

1748
02:24:25,833 --> 02:24:29,542
but with a broken nose,
you'll look like a clown.

1749
02:24:36,458 --> 02:24:38,958
You're going to pay for this.

1750
02:24:53,458 --> 02:24:54,625
What happened, Dad?

1751
02:24:55,958 --> 02:24:57,375
Ace, sonny!

1752
02:25:07,292 --> 02:25:09,875
<i>For the first time,
my father cried with joy.</i>

1753
02:25:10,667 --> 02:25:12,333
That day, I was his hero.

1754
02:25:14,542 --> 02:25:17,250
The same day,
I turned villain for my friend.

1755
02:25:18,292 --> 02:25:22,333
Hey, Kamli. Hope you can hear me.

1756
02:25:23,875 --> 02:25:25,458
When I come out...

1757
02:25:27,250 --> 02:25:29,042
meet me once, buddy.

1758
02:25:30,833 --> 02:25:32,625
If you do, I'll be happy.

1759
02:25:34,333 --> 02:25:37,750
If you don't,
I'll live with your fond memories.

1760
02:25:40,333 --> 02:25:45,708
I'll remember, the first nude girl
my friend saw was 91.

1761
02:25:48,667 --> 02:25:52,375
I'll remember, he perked me up
with vodka-infused tea.

1762
02:25:54,583 --> 02:26:00,583
And to meet me, he bought an air-ticket
with the pennies saved for his first car.

1763
02:26:02,833 --> 02:26:06,083
Hey, Kamli. We're getting old, bro.

1764
02:26:08,417 --> 02:26:10,292
Give me one last hug.

1765
02:26:18,292 --> 02:26:22,083
Tiger, this one's for you.

1766
02:26:22,500 --> 02:26:26,875
<i>On the pathway of time,
At this bend</i>

1767
02:26:27,250 --> 02:26:31,458
<i>I am glad I met such a friend</i>

1768
02:26:32,083 --> 02:26:36,250
<i>Scars are healed
And sorrows end</i>

1769
02:26:36,333 --> 02:26:40,750
<i>Just at the thought
I have such a friend</i>

1770
02:26:40,833 --> 02:26:45,208
<i>On the pathway of time,
At this bend</i>

1771
02:26:45,458 --> 02:26:49,667
<i>I am lucky to find such a friend</i>

1772
02:27:38,875 --> 02:27:40,333
Sanju, take care.

1773
02:28:01,708 --> 02:28:03,833
Sanju! Here...

1774
02:28:04,292 --> 02:28:07,750
A picture, please!

1775
02:28:17,250 --> 02:28:18,250
<i>Sanju!</i>

1776
02:29:09,833 --> 02:29:10,792
Did you marry?

1777
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:13,167
Opened your account?

1778
02:29:16,750 --> 02:29:19,125
Bam-bam without marriage?

1779
02:29:19,500 --> 02:29:23,167
At 80, we'll go to the holy river
to wash our sins.

1780
02:29:23,250 --> 02:29:26,000
If I don't sin, what'll I wash?
My underwear?

1781
02:29:29,583 --> 02:29:31,333
One pic, please!

1782
02:29:33,583 --> 02:29:35,375
Look here.

1783
02:29:43,458 --> 02:29:44,375
The book?

1784
02:29:46,542 --> 02:29:48,500
Master no. 3's song...

1785
02:29:51,083 --> 02:29:52,500
Named the book the same.

1786
02:29:53,583 --> 02:29:54,667
I've cracked it, too.

1787
02:29:56,333 --> 02:29:58,500
Really? Which song?

1788
02:29:58,583 --> 02:30:02,792
Hey, terrorist! Give me a bloody pic!

1789
02:30:07,208 --> 02:30:09,292
<i>Let them talk</i>

1790
02:30:09,500 --> 02:30:11,000
<i>Let them mock</i>

1791
02:30:11,500 --> 02:30:13,667
<i>The path beckons</i>

1792
02:30:13,750 --> 02:30:16,125
<i>You just walk</i>

1793
02:30:17,333 --> 02:30:18,208
Let's go, Kamli.

1794
02:30:21,375 --> 02:30:25,833
<i>Let them talk</i>

1795
02:30:26,583 --> 02:30:29,417
<i>Let them mock</i>

1796
02:30:32,125 --> 02:30:37,292
<i>The path beckons</i>

1797
02:30:37,583 --> 02:30:42,625
<i>You just walk</i>

1798
02:30:49,875 --> 02:30:51,125
Papa, what's this?

1799
02:30:52,833 --> 02:30:56,292
A story of two dads.

1800
02:30:56,875 --> 02:30:59,458
Your dad and my dad.

1801
02:31:00,417 --> 02:31:02,083
Read it someday.

1802
02:31:02,417 --> 02:31:05,667
And be like my dad, not like your dad.

1803
02:31:09,125 --> 02:31:11,417
Your son resembles your dad.

1804
02:31:11,500 --> 02:31:13,250
It's him, reincarnated.

1805
02:31:18,875 --> 02:31:20,125
Just kidding.

1806
02:32:02,500 --> 02:32:05,375
<i>Woke up this morning
Opened the newspaper</i>

1807
02:32:05,625 --> 02:32:08,417
<i>One fake news
Gave me the blues</i>

1808
02:32:08,500 --> 02:32:13,583
<i>Yesterday, attended an event
Bored, I snoozed for a moment</i>

1809
02:32:13,667 --> 02:32:16,750
<i>The two-minute nap
Was a front page snap!</i>

1810
02:32:16,958 --> 02:32:19,417
<i>"Dutt drowned in booze"
Was headline news</i>

1811
02:32:19,500 --> 02:32:22,000
<i>Snooze turned to Booze!</i>

1812
02:32:22,250 --> 02:32:25,000
<i>Snooze turned to Booze!</i>

1813
02:32:25,417 --> 02:32:28,000
<i>Who was the jerk
Who did this dirty work?</i>

1814
02:32:28,167 --> 02:32:30,958
<i>The paper just said:
"According to sources."</i>

1815
02:32:31,125 --> 02:32:33,708
<i>Who is this Mr. Sources?</i>

1816
02:32:33,833 --> 02:32:36,417
<i>What are his resources?</i>

1817
02:32:36,500 --> 02:32:39,458
<i>Who turns a local spar
Into a global war</i>

1818
02:32:39,542 --> 02:32:42,292
<i>Man! That is rough!
Sanju says, enough is enough!</i>

1819
02:32:42,375 --> 02:32:47,708
<i>Sanju says, enough is enough!</i>

1820
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:53,167
<i>Sanju says, enough is enough!</i>

1821
02:32:53,750 --> 02:32:56,292
<i>- According to the sources...
- Zip it!</i>

1822
02:33:00,250 --> 02:33:01,750
<i>Enough is enough!</i>

1823
02:33:05,875 --> 02:33:07,333
<i>Enough is enough!</i>

1824
02:33:07,750 --> 02:33:12,833
<i>Anyone in limelight
Is in Mr. Sources' sight</i>

1825
02:33:13,417 --> 02:33:20,083
<i>Like a lamb to be slaughtered
You're gonna be rogered</i>

1826
02:33:29,792 --> 02:33:35,375
<i>If a tabloid carries your mug
RIP, your grave is dug!</i>

1827
02:33:35,958 --> 02:33:41,375
<i>Mr. Sources has it figured</i>

1828
02:33:41,458 --> 02:33:47,708
<i>Repeats a lie till truth is buggered</i>

1829
02:33:49,875 --> 02:33:52,750
<i>Turns a lie into Gospel truth</i>

1830
02:33:52,958 --> 02:33:55,500
<i>Man! That is rough!
Sanju says, enough is enough!</i>

1831
02:33:55,750 --> 02:34:00,875
<i>Sanju says, enough is enough!</i>

1832
02:34:01,458 --> 02:34:06,708
<i>Sanju says, enough is enough!</i>

1833
02:34:09,750 --> 02:34:12,458
<i>I pulled up a reporter</i>

1834
02:34:12,708 --> 02:34:15,000
<i>Told him, "Control Mr. Sources"</i>

1835
02:34:15,250 --> 02:34:20,625
<i>"Bro, you have a kid and wife,
Let me also have a life"</i>

1836
02:34:26,333 --> 02:34:31,792
<i>"My brain is fried
In the car I've cried"</i>

1837
02:34:32,292 --> 02:34:37,875
<i>"Popped pills to sleep
Yet counted sheep"</i>

1838
02:34:38,458 --> 02:34:42,042
<i>He listened to my plight
Then replied</i>

1839
02:34:46,250 --> 02:34:49,417
<i>I rejoiced, thought it was
The end of the story</i>

1840
02:34:51,750 --> 02:34:57,250
<i>I rejoiced, thought it was
The end of the story</i>

1841
02:34:57,958 --> 02:35:03,333
<i>- But the next day, in the paper
- Saw a new whopper</i>

1842
02:35:03,625 --> 02:35:05,958
<i>Another fake news
Gave me the blues</i>

1843
02:35:06,167 --> 02:35:11,583
<i>Once more the reporter
Fried me proper</i>

1844
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:17,583
<i>“Dutt pops pills in the car
Suicide attempt by the film star!”</i>

1845
02:35:23,167 --> 02:35:25,917
<i>Who was the jerk
Who did this dirty work?</i>

1846
02:35:26,042 --> 02:35:28,708
<i>The paper just said:
“According to sources.”</i>

1847
02:35:28,917 --> 02:35:31,333
<i>Mr. Sources, the undertaker!</i>

1848
02:35:31,500 --> 02:35:34,167

He put me in a coffin</i>
