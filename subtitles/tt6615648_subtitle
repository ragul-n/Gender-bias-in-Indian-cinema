1
00:00:03,375 --> 00:00:04,250
<i>A desire...</i>

2
00:00:05,167 --> 00:00:08,250
<i>is deeper than the ocean.</i>

3
00:00:08,958 --> 00:00:12,250
<i>It's stronger than the</i>
<i>gravitational force.</i>

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,042
<i>Such a desire is scaled in terms</i>
<i>of your determination to fulfill it.</i>

5
00:00:32,417 --> 00:00:35,833
<i>If you don't pay up in next ten days,</i>

6
00:00:36,042 --> 00:00:37,750
<i>you'll lose the second kidney as well.</i>

7
00:00:43,083 --> 00:00:45,708
May I buy you a drink?

8
00:00:49,458 --> 00:00:50,917
I don't know you.

9
00:00:54,458 --> 00:00:58,500
I'm fond of your
paintings and sculptures.

10
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:00,875
I'm a big fan of yours.

11
00:01:01,542 --> 00:01:05,708
I have been stalking... I mean,
studying about you for a few years.

12
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,833
Every creation of yours has agony
and grief to it.

13
00:01:13,917 --> 00:01:15,500
May I know the reason?

14
00:01:26,875 --> 00:01:30,250
Well... may I ask you a simple question?

15
00:01:35,458 --> 00:01:39,125
Why are you dressed in black all the time?

16
00:01:47,708 --> 00:01:49,375
I said I'm fond of your work.

17
00:01:49,833 --> 00:01:51,375
That doesn't mean
I am interested in you.

18
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,333
That's how girls are, sir.

19
00:03:39,667 --> 00:03:41,000
They tend to be short tempered.

20
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:44,333
Do you know her?

21
00:03:47,167 --> 00:03:48,875
You would have known if she had
treated you in the similar manner.

22
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,750
They must have killed us in some time.

23
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,667
All of us worked for a diamond smuggler.

24
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:51,000
His name is Rudra Pratap.

25
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:55,333
He would get furious if anyone
committed a mistake.

26
00:10:56,292 --> 00:10:58,042
I looked after the accounts.

27
00:10:58,917 --> 00:11:02,792
Those three men were assassins.

28
00:11:03,792 --> 00:11:05,542
He is a smuggler by profession.

29
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:08,167
But he is a man of moral.

30
00:11:09,167 --> 00:11:12,167
He was flying to the States that evening.

31
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:14,458
That was my retirement day as well.

32
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,458
I went to hand over the account registers.

33
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:19,708
What happened, Ramulu?

34
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:22,125
I was asked to overlook a
transaction of 10,000 rupees.

35
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,875
As I begged to differ...

36
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:27,208
Call them.

37
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:37,500
Money is a temporary thing.

38
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:41,917
But the thought of backstabbing someone
stays with you.

39
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:47,417
I don't have the time to get your heads
and moustaches shaved.

40
00:11:50,542 --> 00:11:51,958
Hold your footwear.

41
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,875
If I hit you...

42
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,167
you'll be hurt badly.

43
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:05,625
But if he hits you,

44
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:07,333
you'll remember it.

45
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,292
You'll get back to your senses.

46
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:34,625
If I ever see you again,

47
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:41,667
I'll lock you up with my dogs
who are extremely aggressive.

48
00:12:44,917 --> 00:12:46,500
You breed them, right?

49
00:12:47,292 --> 00:12:48,333
You must know better.

50
00:12:49,042 --> 00:12:50,708
They can't resist hunger.

51
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:05,875
No, I wasn't expecting anything.

52
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:12,583
While others see the bandage,

53
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:15,083
I can see how much you respect me.

54
00:13:16,917 --> 00:13:18,500
They have robbed it.

55
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,375
But you have earned my trust.

56
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:27,625
It's the first diamond I bought.

57
00:13:29,042 --> 00:13:30,500
It holds great value to me.

58
00:13:33,167 --> 00:13:34,833
Now, I'm giving it to a valuable person.

59
00:13:37,667 --> 00:13:39,667
They hate me because I got them caught.

60
00:13:40,292 --> 00:13:42,083
And, they are jealous of me because
I received such a valuable gift.

61
00:13:42,542 --> 00:13:44,292
They are hurt.

62
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:48,250
Such a valuable possession should belong
to a person valuable to me.

63
00:13:50,292 --> 00:13:51,583
I'll get going, sir.

64
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:55,667
Do you want me to drop you anywhere?

65
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:59,167
I want to drink some more.

66
00:14:00,917 --> 00:14:01,958
Take care.

67
00:20:03,167 --> 00:20:04,708
MANU - NEELA

68
00:20:26,167 --> 00:20:27,542
<i>A strong rope,</i>

69
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,333
<i>three tomatoes,</i>

70
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:30,958
<i>a cycle bar,</i>

71
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,000
<i>some oil</i>

72
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:35,083
<i>and an iron box.</i>

73
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:38,333
<i>There's no pain.</i>

74
00:20:38,667 --> 00:20:41,750
<i>It's the only trap to catch rats safely.</i>

75
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,750
<i>Rats are quite similar to humans.</i>

76
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:47,958
<i>They are greedy.</i>

77
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,792
<i>They don't have to be informed</i>
<i>on where the food is.</i>

78
00:20:53,542 --> 00:20:55,292
<i>They smell the tomatoes,</i>

79
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,583
<i>crawl onto the rope</i>

80
00:20:57,958 --> 00:20:59,042
<i>and climb the box.</i>

81
00:21:00,667 --> 00:21:05,458
<i>They enter the hole</i>
<i>with the help of the bar.</i>

82
00:21:07,417 --> 00:21:08,833
<i>They can never come out of it.</i>

83
00:21:09,917 --> 00:21:12,667
<i>Even if they tried,</i>
<i>the oil wouldn't allow them.</i>

84
00:21:15,167 --> 00:21:18,333
<i>The rats are caught here</i>
<i>to be dumped elsewhere.</i>

85
00:22:34,417 --> 00:22:35,292
May I speak to Neela?

86
00:22:35,417 --> 00:22:36,667
This is she.

87
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:37,667
This is Akbar.

88
00:22:37,875 --> 00:22:39,208
I saw your advertisement
in the newspaper.

89
00:22:39,833 --> 00:22:41,333
I'll take your house on rent
on immediate basis.

90
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:44,167
The address is mentioned in the
advertisement. Be there in the evening.

91
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:45,917
-I'll show you the house.
-Sure.

92
00:22:49,667 --> 00:22:51,292
Bloody rats!

93
00:22:51,708 --> 00:22:53,542
I cannot put up with them anymore.

94
00:23:04,708 --> 00:23:06,667
They weren't here until a week before.

95
00:23:08,167 --> 00:23:10,333
Where did all the rats come from?

96
00:23:11,875 --> 00:23:12,833
<i>Sia.</i>

97
00:23:13,875 --> 00:23:17,125
<i>A small island near the Arabian Sea.</i>

98
00:23:18,625 --> 00:23:21,167
<i>With the attack of deadly plague</i>
<i>caused by rats,</i>

99
00:23:21,875 --> 00:23:23,458
<i>it has turned into a ghost island.</i>

100
00:23:23,917 --> 00:23:26,833
<i>Which means...</i>
<i>the place is deserted.</i>

101
00:23:27,333 --> 00:23:32,167
<i>A place only smugglers and dealers</i>
<i>would benefit from.</i>

102
00:23:32,583 --> 00:23:34,875
<i>Yet, I love this place.</i>

103
00:23:35,625 --> 00:23:40,208
<i>The sea answered many questions</i>
<i>I had for myself.</i>

104
00:23:41,292 --> 00:23:42,583
<i>It continues to do so.</i>

105
00:23:43,208 --> 00:23:46,417
<i>Waves don't remind me of the past...</i>

106
00:23:47,042 --> 00:23:48,917
<i>or scare me about the future.</i>

107
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:52,875
<i>Right now, at this very moment,</i>
<i>all feels good and possible.</i>

108
00:23:53,375 --> 00:23:57,417
<i>That is why I spend hours staring</i>
<i>at the sea.</i>

109
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:59,083
<i>I'm at my best.</i>

110
00:23:59,792 --> 00:24:00,917
<i>I feel my soul.</i>

111
00:24:02,375 --> 00:24:05,917
<i>Boundless sky and the vast sea.</i>

112
00:24:06,583 --> 00:24:09,417
<i>They teach the pettiness of pain...</i>

113
00:24:09,667 --> 00:24:11,500
<i>and the importance of inspiration.</i>

114
00:24:14,708 --> 00:24:17,375
<i>I have an advice for every restless heart</i>
<i>out there.</i>

115
00:24:17,958 --> 00:24:20,042
<i>Whenever you feel like</i>
<i>you have lost yourself,</i>

116
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:22,875
<i>take a walk by the seashore.</i>

117
00:24:23,375 --> 00:24:25,583
<i>The sand, waves...</i>

118
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,417
<i>and their symphony.</i>

119
00:24:28,792 --> 00:24:32,833
<i>They manifest your lost self</i>
<i>in front of you.</i>

120
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:36,583
<i>The people on this island</i>
<i>are not afraid of the snakes.</i>

121
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:39,833
<i>But they run at the sight of a rat.</i>

122
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:42,000
<i>The effect of plague.</i>

123
00:24:42,792 --> 00:24:44,292
<i>With this small trick,</i>

124
00:24:44,708 --> 00:24:48,000
<i>I'm going to expose the people I want to.</i>

125
00:24:58,208 --> 00:24:59,792
-Akbar?
-Yes.

126
00:25:05,375 --> 00:25:07,375
-I saw the advertisement.
-Yes, this is the place.

127
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:16,417
This is the hall.

128
00:25:22,375 --> 00:25:23,625
You'll be provided all of these.

129
00:25:23,875 --> 00:25:25,333
There's a storeroom as well.

130
00:25:41,708 --> 00:25:44,542
Sewing is my passion.

131
00:25:44,625 --> 00:25:45,792
I love it.

132
00:25:49,542 --> 00:25:50,667
This is the bathroom.

133
00:25:55,792 --> 00:25:57,042
That's the shower.

134
00:26:08,125 --> 00:26:11,542
All the basic facilities are available.

135
00:26:12,083 --> 00:26:13,375
There's pure water supply available.

136
00:26:13,875 --> 00:26:15,625
I don't necessarily have to
rent the house.

137
00:26:15,875 --> 00:26:18,125
You can get that clearly.

138
00:26:18,917 --> 00:26:21,000
But, I'm leaving the place.

139
00:26:21,333 --> 00:26:22,458
That is why I'm putting it on rent.

140
00:26:22,542 --> 00:26:23,792
How much is the advance payment?

141
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:25,542
When can I move in?

142
00:26:26,542 --> 00:26:29,250
Like I told you,
I don't have to rent the house.

143
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:32,208
Which also means that
it's not about the money.

144
00:26:33,542 --> 00:26:35,417
I have a studio in the next lane.

145
00:26:35,833 --> 00:26:37,375
I have got a lot of stuff to organize.

146
00:26:37,792 --> 00:26:39,667
I'll be staying there for now.

147
00:26:40,333 --> 00:26:42,667
You can stay here for a day.

148
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:44,292
Once I'm convinced with your lifestyle,

149
00:26:44,417 --> 00:26:46,708
we can proceed with the payments.

150
00:26:47,958 --> 00:26:49,792
House keys are on top of the cabinet.

151
00:26:51,583 --> 00:26:52,583
Alright.

152
00:26:56,958 --> 00:26:59,833
By the way,
what's that picture on the wall?

153
00:27:00,375 --> 00:27:01,583
It looks weird.

154
00:27:09,167 --> 00:27:11,583
I love photography.

155
00:27:12,667 --> 00:27:15,000
It's my brother's hand.

156
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,542
I mean the shadow.

157
00:27:17,125 --> 00:27:19,417
He passed away due to electrocution.

158
00:27:19,583 --> 00:27:21,292
He loved dogs.

159
00:27:22,042 --> 00:27:24,708
I can feel his presence
through this picture.

160
00:27:26,917 --> 00:27:28,875
I'll take it off if it's disturbing you.

161
00:27:28,958 --> 00:27:29,958
No, it's okay.

162
00:27:30,542 --> 00:27:32,208
It looks good.
In fact, it's unique.

163
00:27:32,708 --> 00:27:34,000
Will you click one for me as well?

164
00:27:34,375 --> 00:27:36,167
-Yes.
-I...

165
00:27:37,167 --> 00:27:38,000
Yes!

166
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,750
I love parrots.

167
00:27:55,875 --> 00:27:57,000
Move a little to your left.

168
00:28:06,792 --> 00:28:08,542
I'll get the final copy tomorrow.

169
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:19,125
In case you have any issues,
note them down.

170
00:28:19,292 --> 00:28:22,167
I'll check tomorrow and get them fixed.

171
00:28:23,417 --> 00:28:24,583
I have one request.

172
00:28:24,667 --> 00:28:26,000
Keep the house clean.

173
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
<i>With every possibility</i>
<i>of finding a solution reducing,</i>

174
00:29:15,375 --> 00:29:16,792
<i>my fear seems to be building up.</i>

175
00:29:17,208 --> 00:29:19,667
<i>I fear that I might not find</i>
<i>what I'm looking for.</i>

176
00:30:33,875 --> 00:30:36,375
Naughty aunty is the only resort
to a hopeless guy.

177
00:30:38,792 --> 00:30:41,000
The Queen of all the chicks!

178
00:30:46,792 --> 00:30:48,792
One can go crazy just by imagining her.

179
00:37:10,083 --> 00:37:12,542
Hey, you naughty!

180
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,375
Can't I dream of you?

181
00:41:03,167 --> 00:41:06,208
<i>What's with the key and the map?</i>

182
00:41:07,167 --> 00:41:08,792
<i>There's some message.</i>

183
00:41:09,333 --> 00:41:10,958
<i>Some hidden pattern.</i>

184
00:41:11,917 --> 00:41:15,667
<i>Above everything, there's a motive.</i>

185
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:19,375
<i>People often ask me</i>
<i>why I'm always dressed in black.</i>

186
00:41:20,917 --> 00:41:22,750
<i>Why is a cloud that pours</i>
<i>black in color?</i>

187
00:41:23,542 --> 00:41:25,250
<i>Because it holds water within.</i>

188
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:28,208
<i>Why do some wounds turn black?</i>

189
00:41:29,083 --> 00:41:30,750
<i>Because the skin cells are dead.</i>

190
00:41:34,542 --> 00:41:36,167
<i>Mom betrayed us and left.</i>

191
00:41:36,542 --> 00:41:39,708
<i>Dad committed suicide out of distress.</i>

192
00:41:40,917 --> 00:41:44,875
<i>That's not the world</i>
<i>a ten-year-old should be in.</i>

193
00:41:46,167 --> 00:41:48,625
<i>I would feel empty inside.</i>

194
00:41:49,875 --> 00:41:51,417
<i>I am not able to...</i>

195
00:41:52,958 --> 00:41:54,208
<i>forget what happened.</i>

196
00:41:54,417 --> 00:41:58,417
<i>It took me long to recover</i>
<i>from that incident.</i>

197
00:42:01,083 --> 00:42:03,583
<i>With time, I turned to art.</i>

198
00:42:03,917 --> 00:42:09,208
<i>I started to portray my</i>
<i>agonizing pain on the canvas.</i>

199
00:42:09,917 --> 00:42:12,583
<i>I wouldn't like any color</i>
<i>other than black.</i>

200
00:42:13,167 --> 00:42:14,792
<i>The color has a unique quality.</i>

201
00:42:15,042 --> 00:42:17,458
<i>It doesn't give away anything.</i>
<i>It conceals everything within.</i>

202
00:42:17,833 --> 00:42:19,333
<i>Orange is for detachment.</i>

203
00:42:19,542 --> 00:42:20,917
<i>White is for peace.</i>

204
00:42:21,083 --> 00:42:22,542
<i>Black is for misery.</i>

205
00:42:23,042 --> 00:42:25,500
<i>You wouldn't get it unless you wear it.</i>

206
00:42:26,167 --> 00:42:28,583
<i>So, black isn't just a color to me.</i>

207
00:42:28,958 --> 00:42:30,083
<i>It's my way to escape.</i>

208
00:45:04,292 --> 00:45:05,583
Is Neela there?

209
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,458
Are you new here?

210
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:12,583
I'm in the middle of making a curry.

211
00:45:12,667 --> 00:45:14,458
I ran short of oil for the dressing.

212
00:45:14,542 --> 00:45:16,167
Could you lend me some?

213
00:45:43,250 --> 00:45:45,167
Are there any thieves in this building?

214
00:45:46,667 --> 00:45:50,875
Well, sometimes milk packets
and newspapers go missing.

215
00:45:51,417 --> 00:45:54,792
Other than that,
there's nothing much we have lost.

216
00:45:54,875 --> 00:45:55,708
Why?

217
00:45:59,583 --> 00:46:00,583
He's my son.

218
00:46:18,917 --> 00:46:21,167
Have you rented the house to anyone
besides me?

219
00:46:22,667 --> 00:46:24,417
The door was shut all the time.

220
00:46:24,542 --> 00:46:26,333
But the things inside the house
are messed up.

221
00:46:26,708 --> 00:46:28,958
<i>A thief would rob everything.</i>

222
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:31,375
A ghost would scare us to death.

223
00:46:31,833 --> 00:46:36,500
But, it wouldn't clean our
beer glasses and cigarette butts.

224
00:46:37,250 --> 00:46:41,125
It's not like someone visited me
and messed everything up.

225
00:46:41,250 --> 00:46:43,542
All my messed up stuff is well organized.

226
00:46:44,125 --> 00:46:46,833
Do you consume alcohol?

227
00:46:52,958 --> 00:46:57,375
Get some medicine
that will help you sleep.

228
00:46:57,750 --> 00:46:59,792
Or else, you can get syrups as well.

229
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,042
Pharmacy is in the next lane.

230
00:47:02,417 --> 00:47:05,667
Have a pill and you'll sleep well.

231
00:47:06,208 --> 00:47:08,708
<i>Those who don't catch enough sleep...</i>

232
00:47:09,167 --> 00:47:12,250
they narrate such stupid stories
in the morning.

233
00:47:13,167 --> 00:47:14,083
Okay.

234
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,625
"Stupid stories!"

235
00:47:19,417 --> 00:47:21,625
Once I intoxicate her and
do what I have to,

236
00:47:21,708 --> 00:47:23,917
will she tell the truth
or make up a story?

237
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,208
Let me see in the evening.

238
00:48:08,875 --> 00:48:09,708
Who is it?

239
00:48:09,917 --> 00:48:11,250
-Hey!
-Yeah, Akbar.

240
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,625
<i>Where is Amar?</i>

241
00:48:14,083 --> 00:48:15,208
He doesn't answer my calls.

242
00:48:15,667 --> 00:48:17,125
<i>He has the diamond.</i>

243
00:48:17,417 --> 00:48:18,833
We have to sell it soon.

244
00:48:19,208 --> 00:48:21,000
We can't keep it with him for long.

245
00:48:22,458 --> 00:48:23,875
Don't tell me he ran away with it.

246
00:48:25,542 --> 00:48:27,458
He wouldn't dare to do so.

247
00:48:28,125 --> 00:48:29,375
<i>I'll find him out.</i>

248
00:48:29,458 --> 00:48:30,375
Where are you?

249
00:48:30,958 --> 00:48:33,083
I'll tell you everything.

250
00:48:33,542 --> 00:48:34,583
<i>I have got work to do.</i>

251
00:48:35,625 --> 00:48:36,875
I'll call you later.

252
00:48:37,792 --> 00:48:39,292
Meanwhile, find out where he is.

253
00:48:39,542 --> 00:48:40,500
I'll do that.

254
00:49:12,958 --> 00:49:14,250
<i>I have OCD.</i>

255
00:49:15,083 --> 00:49:18,417
<i>Whether it's a line drawn</i>
<i>with the help of a scale or...</i>

256
00:49:18,833 --> 00:49:21,042
<i>the lineup of soldiers,</i>

257
00:49:21,542 --> 00:49:23,542
<i>I want everything in order.</i>

258
00:49:24,458 --> 00:49:25,417
<i>Or else,</i>

259
00:49:25,667 --> 00:49:29,500
<i>I feel like someone is messing</i>
<i>with my head.</i>

260
00:49:31,208 --> 00:49:34,917
<i>I can't take it when a thing</i>
<i>is out of its place.</i>

261
00:49:35,750 --> 00:49:39,458
<i>But...</i>
<i>my life is screwed up.</i>

262
00:49:40,125 --> 00:49:42,625
<i>It's like a train slipping off the track.</i>

263
00:49:43,458 --> 00:49:45,417
<i>Or, like a city struck by cyclone.</i>

264
00:50:10,708 --> 00:50:11,833
What are you doing here?

265
00:50:14,167 --> 00:50:15,292
I couldn't sleep.

266
00:50:17,375 --> 00:50:19,167
This is to help me fall asleep.

267
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:21,042
And, this one to help me doze off.

268
00:50:22,292 --> 00:50:23,167
What are you up to?

269
00:50:24,125 --> 00:50:25,375
Winter's coming.

270
00:50:25,542 --> 00:50:27,000
I sew my own sweater.

271
00:50:27,208 --> 00:50:29,083
I'm here to buy wool.

272
00:50:30,792 --> 00:50:33,125
By the way, what's your favorite color?

273
00:50:33,750 --> 00:50:34,625
Why do you ask?

274
00:50:35,417 --> 00:50:36,625
You aren't sewing a sweater for me.

275
00:50:36,750 --> 00:50:39,250
I just wanted to know you.

276
00:50:42,333 --> 00:50:43,167
Red.

277
00:50:45,417 --> 00:50:48,167
Will you have coffee at home this evening?

278
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:52,250
Why should I have a coffee with you?

279
00:50:52,708 --> 00:50:54,250
You just mentioned that
you wanted to know me.

280
00:50:54,583 --> 00:50:56,875
You can do a better job
while having coffee.

281
00:51:01,917 --> 00:51:02,750
I'll try.

282
00:53:42,250 --> 00:53:44,292
It's been half an hour!

283
00:53:45,083 --> 00:53:46,500
I forgot why I'm here
in the first place.

284
00:53:46,625 --> 00:53:47,625
Did you like the house?

285
00:53:50,625 --> 00:53:51,583
I like it.

286
00:53:54,875 --> 00:53:55,875
Just a minute.

287
01:01:14,375 --> 01:01:17,208
<i>Dad, please tell me where you are.</i>

288
01:02:24,917 --> 01:02:29,167
You teased me a lot for lighting
fireworks last Diwali.

289
01:02:31,250 --> 01:02:33,458
Watch me use them in my favor now.

290
01:04:36,375 --> 01:04:41,625
I'm doing a science project in college
on light and shadows.

291
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:45,500
I'm collecting various shapes
for that purpose.

292
01:04:45,875 --> 01:04:47,458
If you don't mind...

293
01:07:24,292 --> 01:07:26,542
<i>Every time I touch this key...</i>

294
01:07:28,333 --> 01:07:30,542
<i>I remember my past.</i>

295
01:07:32,583 --> 01:07:34,292
<i>I just remembered...</i>

296
01:07:36,083 --> 01:07:37,125
<i>I have a friend.</i>

297
01:07:38,167 --> 01:07:39,083
<i>His name is Krishna.</i>

298
01:07:40,417 --> 01:07:41,792
<i>There's something special about him.</i>

299
01:07:42,458 --> 01:07:46,292
<i>He can remember every touch ever felt.</i>

300
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:52,500
Pick one key out of these for me.

301
01:08:12,417 --> 01:08:14,667
Hide it wherever you feel like.
I'll find it.

302
01:08:43,250 --> 01:08:45,208
You didn't put the key back.

303
01:09:24,750 --> 01:09:25,750
How did you do it?

304
01:09:26,458 --> 01:09:28,792
There are around 120 keys in here.

305
01:09:29,333 --> 01:09:30,292
They are all metal.

306
01:09:30,792 --> 01:09:32,292
You can't even press hard
to feel them.

307
01:09:35,542 --> 01:09:37,958
Even our touch has a memory associated.

308
01:09:40,208 --> 01:09:42,583
It's called haptic memory.

309
01:09:43,417 --> 01:09:45,417
All of us have it in us to some extent.

310
01:09:46,875 --> 01:09:50,417
Like we touch and feel to ascertain
whether the batter is too thin

311
01:09:50,500 --> 01:09:52,417
or the rice too soggy.

312
01:09:52,625 --> 01:09:53,750
It's the same logic here.

313
01:09:54,208 --> 01:09:56,917
It's just that I have a greater ability.

314
01:09:58,750 --> 01:09:59,917
Yes, sure.

315
01:10:00,542 --> 01:10:01,500
Stop it.

316
01:10:01,917 --> 01:10:05,083
Just like memory is my power,
knowledge is yours.

317
01:10:07,375 --> 01:10:09,833
<i>I'm looking at every door with a lock.</i>

318
01:10:10,583 --> 01:10:16,583
<i>With an imaginary map of all</i>
<i>the lanes and the doors,</i>

319
01:10:17,458 --> 01:10:19,417
<i>I'm looking all over the island.</i>

320
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:23,333
<i>It feels like I'm looking for a needle</i>
<i>dropped in the sand dunes by the seashore.</i>

321
01:10:26,667 --> 01:10:28,583
<i>Winning or losing doesn't matter to me.</i>

322
01:10:29,458 --> 01:10:30,833
<i>All I know is to...</i>

323
01:10:32,208 --> 01:10:33,500
<i>keep trying.</i>

324
01:10:43,458 --> 01:10:45,208
<i>I'm Neela.</i>

325
01:10:46,375 --> 01:10:48,333
<i>I never thought my love for science...</i>

326
01:10:49,333 --> 01:10:53,583
<i>would help me kill people.</i>

327
01:10:53,667 --> 01:10:56,208
<i>Chemistry is my favorite subject</i>
<i>from the field.</i>

328
01:10:57,375 --> 01:10:59,083
<i>Colorful solutions.</i>

329
01:10:59,167 --> 01:11:02,375
<i>Many experiments and</i>
<i>many more combinations.</i>

330
01:11:02,542 --> 01:11:05,667
<i>There's magic happening</i>
<i>right in front of you.</i>

331
01:11:05,792 --> 01:11:07,417
<i>I love experiments.</i>

332
01:11:07,708 --> 01:11:11,292
<i>But I can't stand</i>
<i>the smell of chemicals and its smoke.</i>

333
01:11:11,458 --> 01:11:13,583
<i>I have asthma.</i>

334
01:11:13,708 --> 01:11:16,125
<i>Happiness, fear and sorrow.</i>

335
01:11:16,208 --> 01:11:20,375
<i>Whenever I feel any of these emotions at</i>
<i>extreme level, I start breathing rapidly.</i>

336
01:11:20,458 --> 01:11:22,000
<i>I get an asthma attack.</i>

337
01:11:22,250 --> 01:11:23,542
<i>I have a small family.</i>

338
01:11:24,083 --> 01:11:25,792
<i>It's just Dad and me.</i>

339
01:11:27,208 --> 01:11:29,083
<i>Mom passed away when I was a kid.</i>

340
01:11:29,750 --> 01:11:33,167
<i>Life was filled with boarding schools</i>
<i>and loneliness.</i>

341
01:11:34,542 --> 01:11:38,625
<i>I took up several hobbies</i>
<i>to stop feeling lonely.</i>

342
01:11:38,792 --> 01:11:42,042
<i>Writing my journal, drawing,</i>

343
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:46,083
<i>singing songs, gardening.</i>

344
01:11:49,333 --> 01:11:50,208
<i>And, sewing clothes.</i>

345
01:11:50,833 --> 01:11:54,583
<i>I would always be occupied</i>
<i>with some activity.</i>

346
01:11:56,083 --> 01:12:00,708
<i>I have never missed having a big family</i>
<i>because of my dad.</i>

347
01:12:01,167 --> 01:12:02,292
<i>He would be a mother,</i>

348
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:05,583
<i>sister,</i>

349
01:12:06,542 --> 01:12:07,583
<i>grandma...</i>

350
01:12:08,792 --> 01:12:09,792
<i>and a brother to me.</i>

351
01:12:10,708 --> 01:12:12,042
<i>My Dad means everything to me.</i>

352
01:12:20,125 --> 01:12:21,083
Dear!

353
01:12:21,875 --> 01:12:25,417
My friend's store is in the next lane.

354
01:12:26,667 --> 01:12:28,333
He's shutting it down.

355
01:12:29,375 --> 01:12:30,917
I have bought the place.

356
01:12:32,417 --> 01:12:33,333
Make use of it.

357
01:12:34,292 --> 01:12:36,208
Turn it into your studio.

358
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,583
Dad, it has been just six months.

359
01:12:40,958 --> 01:12:43,542
You spent so much on my camera already.

360
01:12:44,458 --> 01:12:46,125
Why would you do this now?

361
01:12:46,792 --> 01:12:47,833
It's okay, dear.

362
01:12:49,875 --> 01:12:52,833
Dear, when you were asleep,

363
01:12:53,458 --> 01:12:55,542
I checked all your pictures.

364
01:12:56,917 --> 01:13:00,167
I have zero knowledge but I felt that
every picture had a meaning to it.

365
01:13:00,375 --> 01:13:02,417
The world might see it differently.

366
01:13:03,542 --> 01:13:07,583
I also saw the bills for developing
the pictures.

367
01:13:07,708 --> 01:13:11,542
You have noted the amount borrowed
from your friends.

368
01:13:12,583 --> 01:13:14,917
As a kid, you would ask me
for whatever you wanted.

369
01:13:15,583 --> 01:13:17,333
But now,
you don't accept anything from me.

370
01:13:18,333 --> 01:13:19,583
I can understand.

371
01:13:22,333 --> 01:13:24,333
You want to be on your own.

372
01:13:25,875 --> 01:13:27,292
That is why I bought the place.

373
01:13:29,708 --> 01:13:31,500
Discover more about yourself.

374
01:13:32,458 --> 01:13:38,458
Dear, don't let the worries get to you.

375
01:13:40,208 --> 01:13:41,458
Thank you, Dad.

376
01:13:42,458 --> 01:13:44,417
It's a small place.

377
01:13:46,583 --> 01:13:47,958
You can adjust, right?

378
01:13:53,458 --> 01:13:56,667
<i>His work embodies a lot of loneliness.</i>

379
01:13:59,333 --> 01:14:01,583
<i>Maybe that is why I connected to him.</i>

380
01:14:02,583 --> 01:14:06,542
<i>After realizing my mistake,</i>
<i>I wanted to visit him and apologize.</i>

381
01:14:07,792 --> 01:14:12,167
<i>But, he might assume it's my cheap trick</i>
<i>to chase him around.</i>

382
01:14:13,458 --> 01:14:17,708
<i>That is why I have penned a letter</i>
<i>he would remember me for.</i>

383
01:14:18,417 --> 01:14:22,958
<i>I drew my version of one of his paintings</i>
<i>long back.</i>

384
01:14:24,333 --> 01:14:25,708
<i>If I give it to him,</i>

385
01:14:26,333 --> 01:14:32,042
<i>it'll express my feelings for him.</i>

386
01:15:01,042 --> 01:15:04,708
<i>I can never forget that night.</i>

387
01:15:07,292 --> 01:15:10,667
<i>But... God had some other plans for me.</i>

388
01:15:25,042 --> 01:15:26,500
Your dress looks amazing.

389
01:15:27,500 --> 01:15:28,542
This color suits you well.

390
01:15:30,583 --> 01:15:31,583
Is Ravi here?

391
01:15:32,417 --> 01:15:33,458
He didn't come this year as well.

392
01:15:35,542 --> 01:15:36,375
What about your son?

393
01:15:36,458 --> 01:15:38,250
He played until now and dozed off.

394
01:15:39,292 --> 01:15:40,667
I'll meet him in the morning then.

395
01:17:20,292 --> 01:17:21,208
May I speak to Neela?

396
01:17:21,958 --> 01:17:23,042
Yes, this is she.
Who's this?

397
01:17:23,542 --> 01:17:27,000
I wanted to inquire about the house.

398
01:17:28,083 --> 01:17:29,375
Can I visit now?

399
01:17:30,917 --> 01:17:34,708
It's already late.
Come in the evening tomorrow.

400
01:17:35,125 --> 01:17:36,292
What's your name?

401
01:18:34,917 --> 01:18:35,875
<i>Amar.</i>

402
01:18:36,250 --> 01:18:37,125
Akbar.

403
01:18:37,208 --> 01:18:38,250
<i>Anthony.</i>

404
01:18:39,458 --> 01:18:40,333
Dad!

405
01:18:43,250 --> 01:18:44,208
<i>Their addresses are...</i>

406
01:18:44,292 --> 01:18:46,875
-Dad, where are you?
<i>-somewhere in my account book.</i>

407
01:18:46,958 --> 01:18:48,125
Dad, where are you?

408
01:18:48,208 --> 01:18:49,625
<i>Don't leave them, Neela.</i>

409
01:18:50,042 --> 01:18:51,417
Dad, where are you?

410
01:18:52,833 --> 01:18:55,083
<i>Neela, be careful!</i>

411
01:18:57,292 --> 01:18:58,375
Dad!

412
01:19:00,333 --> 01:19:02,000
Dad, please tell me where you are.

413
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,125
Dad, please tell me.

414
01:19:06,417 --> 01:19:07,958
<i>Hey, put him down.</i>

415
01:19:10,083 --> 01:19:12,917
Dad, please tell me where you are.

416
01:19:18,708 --> 01:19:20,708
<i>Anthony, hold his feet tight.</i>

417
01:19:23,458 --> 01:19:24,542
Dad!

418
01:19:24,625 --> 01:19:27,792
Dad, please tell me where you are.

419
01:19:29,583 --> 01:19:33,000
Dad, please tell me.

420
01:19:38,083 --> 01:19:40,250
<i>Amar, shut his mouth.</i>

421
01:22:28,792 --> 01:22:32,708
You want your spray.

422
01:22:34,042 --> 01:22:34,875
And I...

423
01:22:38,208 --> 01:22:39,500
I want my kidney back.

424
01:22:46,167 --> 01:22:50,208
I know that you have a lot of cash
and a lot of jewelry.

425
01:22:54,375 --> 01:22:56,500
We can live without jewels.

426
01:22:58,333 --> 01:23:00,583
But without a kidney,

427
01:23:02,875 --> 01:23:03,917
we can't.

428
01:23:21,417 --> 01:23:26,375
My throat is drying up
because of the cigarettes.

429
01:23:30,917 --> 01:23:32,542
Before I have a glass of water...

430
01:23:35,500 --> 01:23:37,750
you'll tell me...

431
01:23:39,583 --> 01:23:40,708
where have you hid your money and jewelry.

432
01:23:41,833 --> 01:23:42,917
Or else...

433
01:23:46,458 --> 01:23:47,667
I have got...

434
01:23:50,042 --> 01:23:51,750
four more cigarettes with me.

435
01:24:13,458 --> 01:24:15,917
You think you are smart.

436
01:24:20,958 --> 01:24:24,542
But, do you know what makes you foolish?

437
01:24:28,542 --> 01:24:30,083
You left the keys right here.

438
01:26:12,750 --> 01:26:14,375
<i>As I opened my eyes...</i>

439
01:26:28,167 --> 01:26:32,375
<i>Their addresses...</i>
<i>are somewhere in my account book.</i>

440
01:28:04,167 --> 01:28:05,458
No way!

441
01:28:05,542 --> 01:28:06,542
Don't move an inch.

442
01:28:06,625 --> 01:28:08,583
Stay back for a few days
and return once you recover.

443
01:28:28,667 --> 01:28:30,375
I have to go, dear.

444
01:28:30,917 --> 01:28:32,833
I'll be back in a week.

445
01:28:33,333 --> 01:28:35,583
I promise I won't go anywhere hereafter.

446
01:28:37,625 --> 01:28:40,125
Dear, I'll tell you something.

447
01:28:40,625 --> 01:28:42,667
Don't question me about it.

448
01:28:44,167 --> 01:28:48,583
Let's put this house on rent
and go someplace else.

449
01:28:52,208 --> 01:28:56,458
<i>Dad never made any decisions</i>
<i>without a reason.</i>

450
01:28:57,500 --> 01:28:59,750
I got the flyers printed.

451
01:29:01,833 --> 01:29:05,333
Give them to the newspaper
vendors when you are free.

452
01:31:05,792 --> 01:31:07,833
Damn it!
There are rats everywhere!

453
01:31:30,625 --> 01:31:32,583
Is this Yellow Orchid?

454
01:31:32,792 --> 01:31:33,792
I saw the advertisement.

455
01:31:34,042 --> 01:31:36,708
No, not tomorrow.
I'll come today evening.

456
01:32:36,833 --> 01:32:38,042
I have got two brothers.

457
01:32:41,208 --> 01:32:45,375
One of them likes dogs and
the other one birds.

458
01:32:46,167 --> 01:32:49,750
That is why we had a dog and a parrot.

459
01:32:51,917 --> 01:32:53,458
Both of them died.

460
01:32:54,833 --> 01:32:56,833
One of them was electrocuted...

461
01:32:57,750 --> 01:33:00,167
and the other one
was in a fire accident.

462
01:33:05,833 --> 01:33:07,500
Let it be. They look nice!

463
01:33:07,792 --> 01:33:08,667
They're unique.

464
01:33:09,875 --> 01:33:11,708
I love rabbits.

465
01:33:12,208 --> 01:33:13,208
They look rich.

466
01:33:14,333 --> 01:33:16,542
If you find one like this,
will you get it for me?

467
01:33:17,042 --> 01:33:17,958
I'll put it here.

468
01:33:18,250 --> 01:33:19,333
Right beside them.

469
01:33:21,708 --> 01:33:23,042
I hope you won't mind.

470
01:33:24,583 --> 01:33:27,458
Why do you want someone else's?
Why don't you get yours here?

471
01:37:10,750 --> 01:37:13,792
<i>Your park bench painting</i>
<i>portrays many stories in itself.</i>

472
01:37:21,333 --> 01:37:23,333
<i>He is experiencing trauma.</i>

473
01:37:23,750 --> 01:37:26,208
<i>While she hides an axe behind her.</i>

474
01:37:26,792 --> 01:37:27,958
<i>There's betrayal.</i>

475
01:37:29,833 --> 01:37:33,208
<i>The distance between them speaks</i>
<i>a million words.</i>

476
01:37:33,458 --> 01:37:36,042
<i>His face is visible.</i>

477
01:37:36,583 --> 01:37:37,917
<i>She isn't seen at all.</i>

478
01:37:38,333 --> 01:37:44,000
<i>I don't know if it's a story related</i>
<i>to you or a sheer imagination.</i>

479
01:37:44,500 --> 01:37:45,750
<i>Withered tree.</i>

480
01:37:48,208 --> 01:37:50,625
<i>It embodies hopelessness.</i>

481
01:37:51,458 --> 01:37:53,583
<i>Vultures, bats...</i>

482
01:37:53,958 --> 01:37:55,417
<i>and cactus at the bottom.</i>

483
01:37:56,458 --> 01:37:59,542
<i>There are many interpretations</i>
<i>and many emotions.</i>

484
01:38:03,833 --> 01:38:08,583
<i>Just like you,</i>
<i>the painting is also an abstract.</i>

485
01:38:08,708 --> 01:38:10,458
<i>It is not comprehended so easily.</i>

486
01:38:11,042 --> 01:38:14,917
<i>But... when I looked at the</i>
<i>same painting with positivity,</i>

487
01:38:15,083 --> 01:38:16,750
<i>I could transcend many stories.</i>

488
01:38:17,083 --> 01:38:21,625
<i>I tweaked the picture you painted</i>
<i>with my emotions and saved it.</i>

489
01:38:21,792 --> 01:38:23,708
<i>I have sent you that painting.</i>

490
01:38:24,583 --> 01:38:27,625
<i>When a girl is holding a rose,</i>
<i>it means that...</i>

491
01:38:28,542 --> 01:38:30,458
<i>she's willing to express her love.</i>

492
01:38:31,208 --> 01:38:33,292
<i>There's lush greenery all around.</i>

493
01:38:33,458 --> 01:38:34,708
<i>Blue sky.</i>

494
01:38:35,208 --> 01:38:37,083
<i>A tree with fully borne fruits.</i>

495
01:38:38,375 --> 01:38:41,917
<i>The guy is hesitating to turn around.</i>

496
01:38:53,333 --> 01:38:56,167
<i>Once you read my letter,</i>

497
01:38:56,458 --> 01:38:58,292
<i>I think you'll like me.</i>

498
01:38:58,458 --> 01:39:00,583
<i>If that's not true, sit back at home.</i>

499
01:39:00,792 --> 01:39:05,083
<i>If it's true, meet me</i>
<i>at the mentioned place.</i>

500
01:39:07,958 --> 01:39:11,292
<i>I don't know if I have fallen for her.</i>

501
01:39:11,500 --> 01:39:15,375
<i>But, I can't miss meeting</i>
<i>such a creative girl.</i>

502
01:40:59,083 --> 01:41:01,500
If you have something to
say, I'm happy to talk.

503
01:41:02,125 --> 01:41:03,583
Or else, I'll go ahead with my work.

504
01:41:12,333 --> 01:41:13,458
I know it's you.

505
01:41:14,958 --> 01:41:16,208
But I don't know who you are.

506
01:41:17,375 --> 01:41:18,292
What do you mean?

507
01:41:19,833 --> 01:41:21,167
I like your brown shoes.

508
01:41:24,083 --> 01:41:26,417
How did you know it was me?

509
01:41:28,292 --> 01:41:32,458
You're in a coffee shop,
reading the newspaper upside down.

510
01:41:33,083 --> 01:41:35,875
And your ice cream is melting.

511
01:41:42,958 --> 01:41:44,208
What else did you notice?

512
01:41:45,667 --> 01:41:47,542
Your peeping glances.

513
01:41:49,542 --> 01:41:52,625
Your nails are
as beautiful as your fingers.

514
01:41:57,042 --> 01:42:00,958
At once...
I experienced my life in slow motion.

515
01:42:05,542 --> 01:42:08,042
You're complimenting me already!

516
01:42:08,167 --> 01:42:09,833
<i>I wonder how you would react</i>
<i>when you'll see my face.</i>

517
01:42:11,042 --> 01:42:12,458
<i>Do you want me to hang up?</i>

518
01:42:15,583 --> 01:42:16,583
By the way,

519
01:42:16,833 --> 01:42:19,792
when you figured out who I was,
why didn't you talk to me?

520
01:42:20,375 --> 01:42:23,833
It was your only chance
to prove your smartness.

521
01:42:24,167 --> 01:42:25,750
Why would you miss it?

522
01:42:27,333 --> 01:42:29,333
Going by your actions,
I understand that...

523
01:42:30,708 --> 01:42:32,083
you're nothing like every other girl
out there.

524
01:42:34,583 --> 01:42:36,458
You are much more than one can notice.

525
01:42:36,792 --> 01:42:40,208
For me,
being smart means knowing yourself.

526
01:42:41,458 --> 01:42:42,542
That's all.

527
01:42:44,042 --> 01:42:45,708
But, it's not about ruining my chance.

528
01:42:48,083 --> 01:42:51,208
So, when do you want to see me?

529
01:42:51,583 --> 01:42:52,833
I'm not in a rush.

530
01:42:53,083 --> 01:42:54,792
I'll meet you when you want me to.

531
01:42:56,125 --> 01:42:59,708
You smartly hid yourself from me.

532
01:43:00,333 --> 01:43:03,542
I was patient enough
not to ruin your plan.

533
01:43:04,500 --> 01:43:05,833
Well...

534
01:43:07,083 --> 01:43:08,917
is your birthday coming anytime soon?

535
01:43:09,542 --> 01:43:11,917
You got my address and contact.

536
01:43:12,542 --> 01:43:14,208
How come you
don't know my birthday?

537
01:43:15,833 --> 01:43:17,458
You'll be having a surprise that day.

538
01:43:17,708 --> 01:43:19,083
Don't make any plans.

539
01:43:22,208 --> 01:43:24,500
What?
Won't you wish me a good night?

540
01:43:24,708 --> 01:43:25,833
I can't hear you.

541
01:43:26,583 --> 01:43:28,458
You're asking me to hang up.

542
01:43:29,250 --> 01:43:31,333
Are you trying to act smart?

543
01:47:16,292 --> 01:47:19,208
I know that you're aware
about my arrival to your place.

544
01:47:19,875 --> 01:47:21,250
But, do you know how I managed to come?

545
01:47:21,833 --> 01:47:22,750
From the top floor.

546
01:47:23,708 --> 01:47:24,875
How do you know that?

547
01:47:25,083 --> 01:47:27,083
The steps on the first floor were
painted this evening.

548
01:47:28,125 --> 01:47:29,583
I think that's the paint on your shoes.

549
01:47:30,208 --> 01:47:33,250
There are footmarks in the corridor
and on the steps.

550
01:47:34,833 --> 01:47:35,750
Damn!

551
01:47:36,083 --> 01:47:39,208
I feel I'm really smart all the time.

552
01:47:40,458 --> 01:47:41,958
Who says you're not?

553
01:47:42,708 --> 01:47:45,667
So, wouldn't you ask what I did
in the house?

554
01:47:46,458 --> 01:47:49,583
You aren't a thief to break
into my house and steal things.

555
01:47:50,250 --> 01:47:51,208
You're someone I like.

556
01:47:53,167 --> 01:47:54,208
What did you say?

557
01:47:55,542 --> 01:47:57,167
I said you're not a thief.

558
01:47:57,500 --> 01:48:00,125
You said something after that.

559
01:48:02,458 --> 01:48:04,083
Okay. Don't tell me.

560
01:48:04,583 --> 01:48:08,167
As it's your birthday,
I made five gifts for you.

561
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:11,000
There's a box in your fridge.

562
01:48:11,583 --> 01:48:12,750
Get it and I'll tell you.

563
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:33,333
Why would you hide it in the fridge?
Isn't it weird?

564
01:48:33,500 --> 01:48:36,208
Since I was a kid, I read comic books.

565
01:48:36,458 --> 01:48:38,333
I saw this in many
gangster movies as well.

566
01:48:38,750 --> 01:48:41,625
<i>When thieves break into a house,</i>
<i>they break the lock,</i>

567
01:48:41,708 --> 01:48:43,125
open the cupboards,

568
01:48:43,333 --> 01:48:45,958
tear the mattresses and take away the TV.

569
01:48:46,083 --> 01:48:49,042
At last, they search through
the flush tanks.

570
01:48:49,542 --> 01:48:52,250
<i>But none of them go</i>
<i>anywhere near the fridge.</i>

571
01:48:52,333 --> 01:48:54,708
That's the last place
they would look into.

572
01:48:56,833 --> 01:48:57,958
What are these?

573
01:48:59,667 --> 01:49:03,958
Touch, vision, taste,
smell and sound.

574
01:49:04,042 --> 01:49:06,333
Five gifts for your five senses.

575
01:49:06,583 --> 01:49:10,417
I want to show you how it feels
to touch me.

576
01:49:10,625 --> 01:49:13,917
This morning,
after I washed my hair,

577
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,958
two hair follicles fell off
while drying my hair.

578
01:49:17,708 --> 01:49:20,875
I put them in a tiny bottle
and sent it to you.

579
01:49:21,333 --> 01:49:22,708
If you touch them,

580
01:49:23,250 --> 01:49:25,208
it means you have touched a part of me.

581
01:49:37,250 --> 01:49:38,625
Your hair is quite thick.

582
01:49:40,875 --> 01:49:42,250
<i>There's a photo in it.</i>

583
01:49:42,833 --> 01:49:46,000
Find me amongst the four girls.

584
01:49:46,375 --> 01:49:48,375
That means you got to see me.

585
01:50:11,208 --> 01:50:12,708
You're in the center, holding the baby.

586
01:50:15,208 --> 01:50:16,125
How do you know?

587
01:50:16,417 --> 01:50:20,125
At the coffee shop,
I saw a ring on your left hand.

588
01:50:21,583 --> 01:50:23,167
Luckily, you're wearing it
in this picture as well.

589
01:50:27,917 --> 01:50:29,500
My dad loves me.

590
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:31,417
He gifted me the ring
for my tenth birthday.

591
01:50:32,208 --> 01:50:34,542
Damn! You should have been a detective.

592
01:50:37,542 --> 01:50:38,583
I'm an artiste, you see.

593
01:50:39,042 --> 01:50:40,583
I notice tiny details...

594
01:50:41,500 --> 01:50:42,875
and remember them.

595
01:50:43,958 --> 01:50:45,292
Open the jar now.

596
01:50:48,917 --> 01:50:53,500
I bought the ripest tomatoes
and made chutney for you.

597
01:50:53,875 --> 01:50:57,167
Taste it and you'll know I made it
with lots of love.

598
01:50:57,583 --> 01:50:59,708
-I'll taste it.
-Taste it right now.

599
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:09,167
How does it taste?

600
01:51:09,625 --> 01:51:12,958
I would be fine if I ate the
whole thing tonight, right?

601
01:51:13,500 --> 01:51:15,417
So, you like it.

602
01:51:18,292 --> 01:51:19,792
<i>Now, hold the cloth.</i>

603
01:51:21,083 --> 01:51:27,167
Whenever I go, my fragrance should let
everyone know that I have arrived.

604
01:51:27,792 --> 01:51:31,500
Like the Queen sends her
accomplices before her.

605
01:51:32,167 --> 01:51:37,208
Likewise, as I return,
I leave my fragrance behind.

606
01:51:38,250 --> 01:51:42,125
<i>Like the rain leaves water droplets</i>
<i>on the leaves.</i>

607
01:51:42,500 --> 01:51:45,375
Two things define the beauty of a woman.

608
01:51:45,833 --> 01:51:47,208
Character and fragrance.

609
01:51:50,250 --> 01:51:53,083
I found this concoction when I was 16.

610
01:51:53,792 --> 01:51:58,292
Around 50 people must have asked me
about how I invented it.

611
01:51:58,792 --> 01:52:00,333
I didn't share it with anybody.

612
01:52:00,542 --> 01:52:02,708
<i>Today, I'm sending it to you.</i>

613
01:52:03,125 --> 01:52:06,708
Ask me how did I do it.

614
01:52:09,375 --> 01:52:10,208
Tell me.

615
01:52:10,375 --> 01:52:14,417
Put six jasmines in camphor water
for seven nights.

616
01:52:14,500 --> 01:52:18,500
Leave it in the dark
and take it out after a week.

617
01:52:18,792 --> 01:52:22,500
Mix four sandalwood drops.

618
01:52:22,625 --> 01:52:26,250
Shake it thrice
and sprinkle it on your clothes.

619
01:52:27,292 --> 01:52:29,875
This perfume lasts for three months.

620
01:52:30,167 --> 01:52:33,250
With time, the smell slowly changes.

621
01:52:35,125 --> 01:52:36,583
You won't tell anyone.

622
01:52:37,250 --> 01:52:40,958
I won't tell if you give me a bottle.

623
01:52:41,375 --> 01:52:44,292
Done.
But I'll give it when you least expect it.

624
01:52:45,417 --> 01:52:47,667
You're beginning to fall for me.

625
01:52:48,292 --> 01:52:52,458
Like earlier, you're not finding excuses
to hang up.

626
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:56,833
You say "please" when I ask you to.
You eat my chutney when I want you to.

627
01:53:00,500 --> 01:53:02,792
Anyways, what's this cassette?

628
01:53:03,500 --> 01:53:06,208
At first, I wanted to sing a song for you.

629
01:53:06,917 --> 01:53:08,792
I sat down to pen the lyrics.

630
01:53:08,958 --> 01:53:11,625
I looked for words and they seemed
to be hiding.

631
01:53:12,250 --> 01:53:15,125
Like the moon hides behind the clouds.

632
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:20,250
But every time I think of you,
a symphony haunts me from within.

633
01:53:21,167 --> 01:53:26,500
Like how a pulled string vibrates all day.

634
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:29,458
Only I can hear that symphony.

635
01:53:30,292 --> 01:53:34,542
I worked hard to make that symphony
echo in my voice.

636
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:38,417
Don't curse me.
And don't laugh if it is not good.

637
01:53:38,875 --> 01:53:39,875
Play it.

638
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:41,875
I'm not someone who buys
gifts for special occasions.

639
01:54:43,167 --> 01:54:46,625
I prefer doing
something personal for them.

640
01:54:47,708 --> 01:54:50,417
These gifts may not be beautiful.

641
01:54:50,750 --> 01:54:53,708
But they will be cherished forever.

642
01:54:55,625 --> 01:54:56,500
Definitely!

643
01:54:56,792 --> 01:55:01,792
Pardon me in case I didn't live up
to your expectations.

644
01:55:02,458 --> 01:55:04,667
I can't compliment you and your gifts.

645
01:55:05,250 --> 01:55:06,917
But I can tell you one thing.

646
01:55:08,500 --> 01:55:12,167
No one ever gave me
such beautiful gifts.

647
01:55:13,500 --> 01:55:15,458
I'll not let anyone gift me either.

648
01:55:17,500 --> 01:55:19,458
Diwali is in two days.

649
01:55:19,792 --> 01:55:21,583
Be ready for another surprise.

650
01:55:26,583 --> 01:55:27,875
I can't hear you.

651
01:58:29,750 --> 01:58:30,583
Let it be.

652
01:58:31,417 --> 01:58:32,667
This feels nice.

653
01:58:33,625 --> 01:58:36,000
It is like a fantasy.

654
01:59:36,958 --> 01:59:38,417
It is said that on the evening of Diwali,

655
01:59:39,667 --> 01:59:43,708
Goddess Lakshmi herself
knocks at our door.

656
01:59:51,333 --> 01:59:54,667
Are you upset that
I'm not showing you my face?

657
01:59:59,417 --> 02:00:01,167
Our eyes are right beside one another.

658
02:00:02,375 --> 02:00:03,958
They never look at each other.

659
02:00:05,792 --> 02:00:09,667
But...
they see the same image together.

660
02:00:14,333 --> 02:00:16,542
We are not looking at each other at once.

661
02:00:18,500 --> 02:00:20,125
But, both of us are looking
at the same thing.

662
02:00:21,333 --> 02:00:22,333
-That's love.
-That's love.

663
02:00:28,958 --> 02:00:32,417
I'm hiding my face and
fooling around with you.

664
02:00:33,333 --> 02:00:36,000
How can you still be so patient?

665
02:00:39,333 --> 02:00:41,417
Desires are compared to horses.

666
02:00:42,667 --> 02:00:45,542
If we let the horse take over,
we'll be crushed.

667
02:00:46,333 --> 02:00:49,042
But if we mount the horse,
it's a journey.

668
02:00:51,042 --> 02:00:52,375
I love the journey.

669
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:56,458
When you get emotionally involved,

670
02:00:57,583 --> 02:01:00,875
even feathers feel as heavy as a boulder.

671
02:01:04,417 --> 02:01:06,958
Sugar is always enjoyed.

672
02:01:08,708 --> 02:01:11,958
But once it's in our blood,
it creates chaos.

673
02:01:15,333 --> 02:01:17,792
According to me, out of all the emotions,

674
02:01:18,333 --> 02:01:19,750
love is the strongest.

675
02:01:21,250 --> 02:01:22,958
That is why I keep it limited.

676
02:01:26,333 --> 02:01:29,375
Even at this moment,
I want to see you.

677
02:01:34,542 --> 02:01:35,750
I want to feel you.

678
02:02:22,250 --> 02:02:23,958
I can't sing like you...

679
02:02:24,792 --> 02:02:26,208
or make smart plans like you.

680
02:02:27,583 --> 02:02:28,500
I can't do it.

681
02:02:29,833 --> 02:02:31,000
My dad gave me this.

682
02:02:32,250 --> 02:02:36,083
He made this for me on my fifth birthday.

683
02:02:37,833 --> 02:02:39,583
When my house was burning down,

684
02:02:40,333 --> 02:02:43,833
I risked my life and went in
only for this.

685
02:02:47,125 --> 02:02:48,333
From now onwards,

686
02:02:49,708 --> 02:02:50,542
it is yours.

687
02:03:09,792 --> 02:03:12,583
This happens when I'm anxious.

688
02:03:12,708 --> 02:03:13,542
That's all.

689
02:05:33,833 --> 02:05:35,500
<i>Sometimes, she gives clues intentionally.</i>

690
02:05:35,708 --> 02:05:37,292
<i>Then, she forgets things for real.</i>

691
02:05:37,708 --> 02:05:41,250
<i>There's a possibility this</i>
<i>is just a random paper.</i>

692
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:45,125
<i>But my instincts state otherwise.</i>

693
02:05:46,333 --> 02:05:47,417
<i>I'll go directly.</i>

694
02:05:48,292 --> 02:05:51,083
<i>If it's her house,</i>
<i>it'll be a surprise for her.</i>

695
02:05:52,500 --> 02:05:54,375
<i>If not, I'll be surprised.</i>

696
02:06:09,250 --> 02:06:10,833
<i>Should I go or not?</i>

697
02:06:11,333 --> 02:06:13,167
<i>Should I go or not?</i>

698
02:06:13,792 --> 02:06:15,250
<i>Should I go or not?</i>

699
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:31,333
Neela!

700
02:08:33,875 --> 02:08:35,042
Neela!

701
02:08:37,458 --> 02:08:38,583
Neela!

702
02:11:07,875 --> 02:11:08,708
Neela!

703
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:11,833
Neela!

704
02:12:00,917 --> 02:12:03,083
<i>A million summers would strike at once.</i>

705
02:12:04,083 --> 02:12:08,167
<i>I feel they're fuming</i>
<i>the tears in my eyes.</i>

706
02:12:09,250 --> 02:12:14,500
<i>Every breath passes through</i>
<i>with a lot of difficulty.</i>

707
02:12:15,667 --> 02:12:17,500
<i>I came to catch a glimpse of her.</i>

708
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:19,458
<i>But I see her lying dead.</i>

709
02:12:20,500 --> 02:12:23,417
<i>We can't take it when</i>
<i>our loved one leaves us.</i>

710
02:12:23,667 --> 02:12:26,042
<i>But when she left me...</i>

711
02:13:00,792 --> 02:13:04,292
<i>Did they run away with the</i>
<i>diamond and leave me behind?</i>

712
02:13:05,708 --> 02:13:07,750
<i>I don't think so.</i>

713
02:13:10,417 --> 02:13:12,708
<i>Akbar called up saying</i>
<i>Amar didn't answer his call.</i>

714
02:13:13,417 --> 02:13:15,083
<i>And when I'm calling,</i>
<i>both of them aren't answering.</i>

715
02:13:16,875 --> 02:13:18,125
<i>Something is wrong.</i>

716
02:13:19,542 --> 02:13:20,667
<i>It's better to confront them.</i>

717
02:16:58,208 --> 02:17:00,167
Hey, Manu.
How are you?

718
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:05,167
I'm merely existing.

719
02:17:05,875 --> 02:17:06,875
How are you?

720
02:17:07,833 --> 02:17:08,875
I'm alright.

721
02:17:10,042 --> 02:17:12,833
I have got a vintage lock.

722
02:17:12,958 --> 02:17:15,042
I need your help to estimate the price.

723
02:17:15,875 --> 02:17:18,333
Can you come
or do you want me to come over?

724
02:17:20,500 --> 02:17:21,375
I'll come myself.

725
02:18:05,417 --> 02:18:06,792
I don't see you around these days.

726
02:18:08,667 --> 02:18:09,792
It's the new artwork.

727
02:18:10,708 --> 02:18:12,208
I'm looking for some ideas.

728
02:18:15,083 --> 02:18:17,167
I don't get the concept of vintage locks.

729
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:19,542
How to unlock them?

730
02:18:25,667 --> 02:18:26,708
Where are the keys?

731
02:19:05,625 --> 02:19:07,625
It's a 450 years old lock.

732
02:19:09,833 --> 02:19:11,750
It's from the times of
Chhatrapathi Shivaji.

733
02:19:15,375 --> 02:19:18,917
You can sell it for
thrice the price than you expect.

734
02:19:24,333 --> 02:19:26,875
This is why I say that
you have got knowledge.

735
02:19:30,833 --> 02:19:32,375
What about this?

736
02:19:38,625 --> 02:19:40,667
I have seen this lock before.

737
02:19:42,125 --> 02:19:43,250
What's in it anyways?

738
02:19:44,625 --> 02:19:45,750
It's just an ordinary lock.

739
02:19:47,333 --> 02:19:48,958
It's just painted dark.

740
02:19:50,917 --> 02:19:53,208
And you can figure that it
was broken and glued back.

741
02:20:01,042 --> 02:20:04,625
At first, even I assumed
it's a regular lock.

742
02:20:09,833 --> 02:20:11,917
Sometimes we over think it.

743
02:20:12,833 --> 02:20:17,333
We assume that we're smart
and ignore the basic details.

744
02:20:19,917 --> 02:20:22,958
When we see a white paper
with a black dot,

745
02:20:23,333 --> 02:20:26,167
we stare at the dot and
ignore the whole paper.

746
02:20:28,625 --> 02:20:33,167
The locksmith has shown his skill
in emphasizing on what we ignore.

747
02:20:35,375 --> 02:20:38,500
He diverted our focus
to the front keyhole...

748
02:20:40,250 --> 02:20:41,542
hiding the actual keyhole.

749
02:20:42,667 --> 02:20:46,042
As it looks like a basic lock,

750
02:20:46,500 --> 02:20:48,500
we wouldn't expect there
would be a second keyhole.

751
02:20:48,958 --> 02:20:50,708
Here lies the real mastery.

752
02:20:51,125 --> 02:20:55,167
Diverting our focus from something
that looks crystal clear.

753
02:20:56,375 --> 02:20:59,167
An earthworm is used to reel in fish.

754
02:21:00,208 --> 02:21:03,750
The fish is fixated at the earthworm,
ignoring the hook.

755
02:21:04,583 --> 02:21:05,833
It is thus trapped.

756
02:21:19,500 --> 02:21:20,542
Where did you find this?

757
02:21:20,625 --> 02:21:24,500
I was at the scrap market the other day.
There was a truck filled with metal.

758
02:21:24,792 --> 02:21:26,458
It fell off the truck while
I was passing by.

759
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:30,208
In the world of antiques,
we don't find the objects.

760
02:21:30,875 --> 02:21:32,667
The objects find us.

761
02:21:33,417 --> 02:21:37,167
I brought it thinking it might be
lucky for us.

762
02:21:37,292 --> 02:21:38,542
Can I take it?

763
02:21:39,167 --> 02:21:41,958
I mean... I'll draw its design
and mechanics.

764
02:21:42,042 --> 02:21:43,333
I'll get it back to you.

765
02:21:45,208 --> 02:21:47,167
You don't have to ask for it.
Take it.

766
02:21:47,958 --> 02:21:49,750
Okay.
I have got work to do.

767
02:21:50,167 --> 02:21:51,125
I'll see you later.

768
02:21:51,208 --> 02:21:53,708
-Why don't you stay for a while?
-Like I told you, it's a new artwork.

769
02:21:55,333 --> 02:21:56,167
Thanks, man.

770
02:23:29,083 --> 02:23:30,083
Is this Neela?

771
02:23:31,875 --> 02:23:33,000
This is Manu.

772
02:23:33,917 --> 02:23:35,333
<i>No way!</i>

773
02:23:36,042 --> 02:23:37,417
<i>This must be a coincidence.</i>

774
02:23:38,375 --> 02:23:40,708
<i>I haven't mentioned my name anywhere.</i>

775
02:23:41,042 --> 02:23:43,750
<i>There's no chance he would know my name.</i>

776
02:23:45,792 --> 02:23:46,833
Tell me.

777
02:23:47,208 --> 02:23:49,083
I saw your advertisement in the newspaper.

778
02:23:50,833 --> 02:23:53,375
I called to find out if your house
was still available.

779
02:23:54,917 --> 02:23:56,667
Don't consider if I'm a family man
or a bachelor.

780
02:23:57,708 --> 02:23:59,333
I'll look after your
house better than you.

781
02:24:01,167 --> 02:24:03,958
Meet me tomorrow at ten in the morning.

782
02:24:56,792 --> 02:24:58,583
I have seen you before.

783
02:24:58,958 --> 02:25:00,375
Yes, the other day at the bar.

784
02:25:06,333 --> 02:25:09,833
Sorry. I got to know the truth later.

785
02:25:09,958 --> 02:25:11,083
It's okay.

786
02:25:11,292 --> 02:25:14,625
Girls these days are short tempered.

787
02:25:51,417 --> 02:25:54,208
I like the house.
What's the rent?

788
02:25:55,875 --> 02:25:57,542
Stay here for the night.

789
02:25:57,833 --> 02:26:00,542
I'll come back tomorrow.
Once I'm okay with your lifestyle,

790
02:26:00,625 --> 02:26:03,083
we can proceed with the payments.

791
02:26:51,792 --> 02:26:54,000
Why do you keep hanging up the phone?

792
02:26:54,375 --> 02:26:56,875
Don't hang up on me.
I am really irritated.

793
02:27:03,042 --> 02:27:04,667
How long do you want me to wait?

794
02:27:05,625 --> 02:27:07,042
It's been three years since you left.

795
02:27:07,833 --> 02:27:10,042
Our son keeps asking for you.
What do I tell him?

796
02:27:11,292 --> 02:27:13,667
You talk like you're the only one
working hard.

797
02:27:14,917 --> 02:27:16,458
You hang up for petty things.

798
02:27:16,833 --> 02:27:20,458
I am warning you!
Don't you dare hang up on me again.

799
02:27:21,167 --> 02:27:22,708
<i>It's nothing like that.</i>

800
02:27:22,917 --> 02:27:24,292
<i>There's a lot of work going around.</i>

801
02:27:26,958 --> 02:27:28,625
I somehow feel doubtful about this.

802
02:28:03,583 --> 02:28:04,958
You're new here, right?

803
02:28:05,583 --> 02:28:06,417
Yes.

804
02:28:07,000 --> 02:28:10,042
-Sorry for bothering you at this time.
-It's okay.

805
02:33:01,833 --> 02:33:06,875
<i>The only thing he lost</i>
<i>and God gifted me... is this key.</i>

806
02:35:08,208 --> 02:35:11,958
<i>I still feel the dampness</i>
<i>of her sweat on me.</i>

807
02:38:31,042 --> 02:38:35,500
Only after you wake up,
you'll experience Hell.

808
02:39:16,667 --> 02:39:18,417
How did you die?

809
02:40:11,042 --> 02:40:15,792
No matter how hard I try,
I can't get myself to draw his eyes.

810
02:40:56,125 --> 02:40:57,583
You have killed two people.

811
02:40:58,542 --> 02:41:01,625
You don't have to take up this freight.

812
02:41:04,000 --> 02:41:07,500
Leave him to me.

813
02:41:16,750 --> 02:41:20,458
Do you have a mosquito coil
or bug spray at home?

814
02:41:28,042 --> 02:41:30,875
We're dead.
You don't have asthma anymore.

815
02:41:35,750 --> 02:41:37,042
Untie him.

816
02:45:10,833 --> 02:45:15,167
Do you know the meaning of your name?

817
02:45:19,417 --> 02:45:21,333
I remember my dad telling me once.

818
02:45:23,125 --> 02:45:24,750
It means the first ever human.

819
02:45:30,375 --> 02:45:34,792
Great deluge, boat, veda.

820
02:45:37,083 --> 02:45:38,667
I heard he saved them all.

821
02:45:42,167 --> 02:45:45,250
The name has got another meaning.

822
02:45:46,750 --> 02:45:51,583
"Manu" means sustenance of life.

823
02:45:54,458 --> 02:45:56,708
Back when I used to make perfumes,

824
02:45:57,292 --> 02:46:01,583
I would drop the bottles, breaking them.

825
02:46:03,042 --> 02:46:05,833
But, even after a long period of time,

826
02:46:06,250 --> 02:46:09,583
their fragrance would remain as it is.

827
02:46:11,125 --> 02:46:13,333
I don't know if the fragrance
was in anguish for ruining it...

828
02:46:13,875 --> 02:46:17,958
or was feeling gratitude
for giving life to it.

829
02:46:18,833 --> 02:46:20,042
Yet, the fragrance remained.

830
02:46:20,458 --> 02:46:23,792
Some of the fragrances would last
for six months.

831
02:46:26,958 --> 02:46:31,083
When a few things create such magic,

832
02:46:32,833 --> 02:46:34,292
you start believing in miracles.

833
02:46:35,292 --> 02:46:40,292
When he loves or seeks
revenge from someone,

834
02:46:41,208 --> 02:46:42,583
how intense would that feeling be?

835
02:46:52,708 --> 02:46:55,833
By the way, what did you do
with the three corpses?

836
02:46:57,708 --> 02:46:58,583
Hold on.

837
02:46:59,542 --> 02:47:02,833
You said I killed two people earlier.

838
02:47:03,708 --> 02:47:09,625
How did you know that
I didn't kill the third?

839
02:48:44,792 --> 02:48:47,917
I know... I wondered
how you could be so smart.

840
02:48:50,917 --> 02:48:54,167
I tied rocks to the three corpses,

841
02:48:54,458 --> 02:48:57,833
and dumped them in the
well behind the sugarcane field.

842
02:48:59,667 --> 02:49:01,833
That reminds me.

843
02:49:02,500 --> 02:49:05,917
What about our corpses?

844
02:49:54,458 --> 02:49:58,417
I guess you didn't get one last
glimpse of your father. So...

845
02:50:47,917 --> 02:50:51,125
I feel there's still life in them.

846
02:50:52,667 --> 02:50:54,000
Art itself is...

847
02:50:58,542 --> 02:51:00,000
instilling life.

848
02:51:28,750 --> 02:51:33,208
<i>As you extract all the blood from the body</i>
<i>and inject formaldehyde,</i>

849
02:51:34,042 --> 02:51:39,958
<i>all the organs get</i>
<i>preserved for a long time.</i>

850
02:52:04,125 --> 02:52:07,333
<i>Honey is a natural preservative.</i>

851
02:52:08,500 --> 02:52:11,333
<i>It prevents the skin from decaying.</i>

852
02:52:58,583 --> 02:53:02,250
<i>Only black defines my entire life.</i>

853
02:53:04,292 --> 02:53:07,333
<i>That is why I made it</i>
<i>a part of my death as well.</i>

854
02:53:21,875 --> 02:53:25,958
<i>In death, there's no right or wrong.</i>

855
02:53:27,250 --> 02:53:28,750
<i>It's a holy temple.</i>

856
02:53:29,292 --> 02:53:31,292
<i>That is why I adorned them.</i>

857
02:53:32,292 --> 02:53:35,167
<i>Life that changes in the</i>
<i>blink of an eye is transient.</i>

858
02:53:35,667 --> 02:53:39,417
<i>Love that is beyond life</i>
<i>and death is eternal.</i>

859
02:53:40,083 --> 02:53:44,250
<i>I welcome you from transitory</i>
<i>to eternity, Neela.</i>

860
02:53:50,625 --> 02:53:52,292
Our revenge is sought.

861
02:53:54,542 --> 02:53:56,083
We have come together.

862
02:53:59,042 --> 02:54:03,917
Why are we still stuck here?

863
02:54:05,500 --> 02:54:07,417
It's for the diamond in your dad's hand.

864
02:54:07,500 --> 02:54:09,208
Three of them killed your dad.

865
02:54:09,333 --> 02:54:11,167
Showing me the diamond, he said...

866
02:54:11,792 --> 02:54:17,583
"Such a valuable possession should belong
to a person valuable to me."

867
02:54:51,625 --> 02:54:56,583
MANU - NEELA

868
02:55:05,042 --> 02:55:08,542
<i>From a drop of water to</i>
<i>a grain of sand.</i>

869
02:55:09,708 --> 02:55:13,333
<i>From the source of life</i>
<i>to the ashes burnt.</i>

870
02:55:14,208 --> 02:55:16,958
<i>The cause behind</i>
<i>every occurrence is karma.</i>

871
02:55:17,958 --> 02:55:21,708
If your intentions are good,
karma liberates you.

872
02:55:22,417 --> 02:55:26,417
In case it's bad, it enslaves you.
