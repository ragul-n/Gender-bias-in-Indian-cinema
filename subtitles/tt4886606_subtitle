1
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04,452
<i>Previously on</i> Madam Secretary...

2
00:00:04,453 --> 00:00:05,243
Elizabeth, you know

3
00:00:05,244 --> 00:00:07,173
- Craig Sterling.
- Madam Secretary.

4
00:00:07,174 --> 00:00:08,142
ELIZABETH: <i>Nakedly ambitious,</i>

5
00:00:08,143 --> 00:00:09,310
<i>self-serving,</i>

6
00:00:09,311 --> 00:00:10,377
obstructionist.

7
00:00:10,378 --> 00:00:11,779
All suit and no substance.

8
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:14,477
I can't believe Conrad would
make that appointment

9
00:00:14,478 --> 00:00:15,610
without consulting with me.

10
00:00:15,611 --> 00:00:17,212
The president of the United States

11
00:00:17,213 --> 00:00:19,147
can do whatever the hell he wants.

12
00:00:19,148 --> 00:00:20,281
I'll be your main contact at DIA.

13
00:00:20,282 --> 00:00:21,591
<i>We have an eye on one of your students.</i>

14
00:00:21,592 --> 00:00:23,294
<i>He's training to serve
under General Doroshevich,</i>

15
00:00:23,295 --> 00:00:25,262
one of the highest-ranking
members of the Russian military

16
00:00:25,263 --> 00:00:27,841
and a close advisor to President Ostrov.

17
00:00:27,842 --> 00:00:29,736
- HENRY: <i>Dmitri Petrov.</i>
- JANE: <i>I want you to bring him in.</i>

18
00:00:29,737 --> 00:00:31,453
You mean recruit him.
And be his handler.

19
00:00:31,454 --> 00:00:34,121
- What? No. Wait. No.
- Henry, we need this.

20
00:00:34,122 --> 00:00:37,490
Russian continues to be our
next real nuclear threat.

21
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:48,503
All right, after we're done
with the junction boxes,

22
00:00:48,504 --> 00:00:50,805
we can go ahead and start
installing the conduit supports

23
00:00:50,806 --> 00:00:51,973
tomorrow, okay?

24
00:00:51,974 --> 00:00:53,241
- Yes, sir.
- All right.

25
00:00:53,242 --> 00:00:56,462
- Good night, Farid.
- Thank you. So long.

26
00:01:12,327 --> 00:01:15,163
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
No, no, no, no! No, no, no!

27
00:01:15,164 --> 00:01:17,464
(groaning)

28
00:01:19,233 --> 00:01:21,535
(yelling)

29
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:25,706
Gone M.I.A. where in the world

30
00:01:25,707 --> 00:01:28,643
is Russian President Pavel Ostrov?

31
00:01:28,644 --> 00:01:30,878
The mercurial leader has not been seen

32
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:34,215
in public for a week now,
leading to speculation

33
00:01:34,216 --> 00:01:37,785
of a secret tummy tuck,
to a rendezvous in Gustat

34
00:01:37,786 --> 00:01:41,355
for the birth of his love
child, to a bloody coup...

35
00:01:41,356 --> 00:01:42,667
I'm going with tummy tuck.

36
00:01:42,668 --> 00:01:43,935
Vanity. That's always a good option.

37
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:45,737
- Didn't you go hunting with him, Dad?
- Yeah.

38
00:01:45,738 --> 00:01:47,272
- Maybe a Siberian tiger got him.
- Yeah.

39
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:50,717
Or maybe the Russian Air
Force One went missing.

40
00:01:52,941 --> 00:01:53,718
Too soon?

41
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:54,885
Let's give it a year.

42
00:01:54,886 --> 00:01:56,721
So what do you think about Ostrov, Mom?

43
00:01:56,722 --> 00:01:57,922
Something salacious?

44
00:01:57,923 --> 00:01:59,657
I think that

45
00:01:59,658 --> 00:02:02,593
dictators do whatever
the hell they want...

46
00:02:02,594 --> 00:02:04,462
and like it when the world worries.

47
00:02:04,463 --> 00:02:05,563
Well, I'm sure your buddy,

48
00:02:05,564 --> 00:02:06,964
the Russian foreign minister guy, knows.

49
00:02:06,965 --> 00:02:08,199
STEVIE: Maybe Mom knows

50
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,400
and she can't tell us.

51
00:02:09,401 --> 00:02:11,502
Ooh, you really think
she's that good a liar?

52
00:02:11,503 --> 00:02:13,003
She lies for a living.

53
00:02:13,004 --> 00:02:14,472
Oh... not true.

54
00:02:14,473 --> 00:02:16,040
I'm starting to feel a little attacked.

55
00:02:16,041 --> 00:02:18,742
Then it's a good thing we have
a peer mediator in the family.

56
00:02:18,743 --> 00:02:20,277
Talking stick, anyone?

57
00:02:20,278 --> 00:02:24,214
Same one I've used to settle
many a disagreement at school.

58
00:02:24,215 --> 00:02:27,216
Okay. You're a loser.

59
00:02:27,584 --> 00:02:29,019
Hey, it works.

60
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:30,721
Yeah, it does, just not
on the brain-dead.

61
00:02:30,722 --> 00:02:32,589
Okay, you guys, go to
school, please. Get out.

62
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:34,458
You're so lucky I'm still driving you.

63
00:02:34,459 --> 00:02:35,793
- Bye. Love you.
- Please don't.

64
00:02:35,794 --> 00:02:37,394
- Bye. I love you, too. Bye.
- Bye.

65
00:02:37,395 --> 00:02:39,963
See you. Um,

66
00:02:39,964 --> 00:02:42,232
actually, Stevie, you want
to hang back for a second?

67
00:02:42,233 --> 00:02:44,067
Yeah. Oh. Um...

68
00:02:44,068 --> 00:02:46,336
I'm sorry that I said
that you lie for a living.

69
00:02:46,337 --> 00:02:47,371
It's not that.

70
00:02:47,372 --> 00:02:49,573
Just, will you take a look at this?

71
00:02:49,574 --> 00:02:51,542
Yeah. What is it?

72
00:02:51,543 --> 00:02:53,477
It's a lab report.

73
00:02:53,478 --> 00:02:57,080
Um, we had the powder in
the bag you gave me tested.

74
00:02:57,081 --> 00:02:58,749
It came back positive for heroin.

75
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,284
Yeah, well, I told you that Harrison

76
00:03:00,285 --> 00:03:01,818
said it was an old stash.

77
00:03:01,819 --> 00:03:03,253
Yeah, we just wanted to make sure.

78
00:03:03,254 --> 00:03:04,888
There's also... (clears his throat)

79
00:03:04,889 --> 00:03:07,156
There's also this.

80
00:03:10,327 --> 00:03:12,496
A toxicology report.

81
00:03:12,497 --> 00:03:14,464
Follicle analysis.

82
00:03:14,465 --> 00:03:17,125
We had the hair from your brush tested.

83
00:03:21,371 --> 00:03:23,306
You thought I was doing heroin?

84
00:03:23,307 --> 00:03:24,874
Honestly, we didn't know what to think,

85
00:03:24,875 --> 00:03:26,209
but can you really blame us?

86
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:27,444
It came back clean, you know.

87
00:03:27,445 --> 00:03:30,588
Although, you are a
little calcium deficient.

88
00:03:30,589 --> 00:03:32,584
You might want to think about
switching back to regular milk.

89
00:03:32,585 --> 00:03:33,347
- That's not...
- I'm just saying...

90
00:03:33,348 --> 00:03:35,153
This is such a violation of my trust.

91
00:03:35,154 --> 00:03:37,054
Well, you violated our trust.

92
00:03:37,055 --> 00:03:39,023
You-you lied to us
about dating Harrison.

93
00:03:39,024 --> 00:03:41,392
(laughing): Okay.

94
00:03:41,393 --> 00:03:43,894
I can date anyone that I want.

95
00:03:43,895 --> 00:03:45,930
Well, but, um, he's not anyone.

96
00:03:45,931 --> 00:03:47,898
He's my boss's son.

97
00:03:47,899 --> 00:03:49,500
- Okay, okay. Is that all?
- No.

98
00:03:49,501 --> 00:03:51,001
Actually, now that we know the heroin

99
00:03:51,002 --> 00:03:52,737
is real, someone's got to tell his parents.

100
00:03:52,738 --> 00:03:54,638
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What? What?

101
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:56,140
If Harrison is using, do you really

102
00:03:56,141 --> 00:03:57,541
want it on your conscience

103
00:03:57,542 --> 00:03:59,009
that you didn't notify them?

104
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:01,145
And-and if, God forbid,
he winds up OD'ing again...

105
00:04:01,146 --> 00:04:02,446
We think it would be best

106
00:04:02,447 --> 00:04:04,815
if you let him come clean
with his parents first.

107
00:04:04,816 --> 00:04:07,476
Short of that, we'll go
to them this afternoon.

108
00:04:10,054 --> 00:04:13,123
Fine.

109
00:04:13,124 --> 00:04:15,124
I'll tell him.

110
00:04:19,229 --> 00:04:21,498
JAY: <i>And this is security
camera footage of the grab.</i>

111
00:04:21,499 --> 00:04:22,700
That's Tom Garrity.

112
00:04:22,701 --> 00:04:24,968
ELIZABETH: What about
his security detail?

113
00:04:24,969 --> 00:04:27,137
Two APPF guards outside the building

114
00:04:27,138 --> 00:04:28,472
on the perimeter of the site?

115
00:04:28,473 --> 00:04:30,507
The kidnappers took Garrity
out the opposite side.

116
00:04:30,508 --> 00:04:31,775
DAISY: We're monitoring Taliban,

117
00:04:31,776 --> 00:04:34,545
ISIS and all the usual
radical Web sites.

118
00:04:34,546 --> 00:04:36,580
Pretty audacious, grabbing
a state department employee

119
00:04:36,581 --> 00:04:38,015
right in the middle of Kabul.

120
00:04:38,016 --> 00:04:39,283
Let's put our embassy there

121
00:04:39,284 --> 00:04:42,486
and all diplomatic outposts
in country on high alert.

122
00:04:42,487 --> 00:04:43,687
Quietly.

123
00:04:43,688 --> 00:04:45,489
And if anyone asks why?

124
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:46,790
Just say it's a drill or something.

125
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:49,459
We want to keep our options
open until we know more.

126
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,361
Thank you, everybody.

127
00:04:51,362 --> 00:04:53,597
Ma'am, you have the merchant
marine event this afternoon.

128
00:04:53,598 --> 00:04:55,065
You wanted me to remind you

129
00:04:55,066 --> 00:04:57,000
that Secretary Albright will be there.

130
00:04:57,001 --> 00:04:58,135
Right. I, um...

131
00:04:58,136 --> 00:05:00,504
I want to wear that
pin that she gave me.

132
00:05:00,505 --> 00:05:02,105
Yes, ma'am.

133
00:05:02,106 --> 00:05:05,242
You'll be laying a wreath with
Russian Ambassador Zinchenko

134
00:05:05,243 --> 00:05:08,678
honoring U.S.-Russian
cooperation during World War II.

135
00:05:08,679 --> 00:05:11,948
Oh, maybe the ambassador knows
where his fearless leader is.

136
00:05:11,949 --> 00:05:14,618
Oh, well, uh, short of that,

137
00:05:14,619 --> 00:05:18,088
the White House would like
a revised write-up of our

138
00:05:18,089 --> 00:05:20,056
- post-Ostrov Russia plan.
- (laughs)

139
00:05:20,057 --> 00:05:21,791
(groans)

140
00:05:21,792 --> 00:05:25,028
And, uh, you're here to complain
about that assignment, Jay?

141
00:05:25,029 --> 00:05:27,330
They want a joint report with DOD.

142
00:05:27,331 --> 00:05:29,799
Defense is gonna advocate
taking the opportunity

143
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,702
to roll back Russian aggression
with some aggression of our own.

144
00:05:32,703 --> 00:05:33,903
Exactly.

145
00:05:33,904 --> 00:05:36,406
Provoking the second biggest
nuclear power on Earth

146
00:05:36,407 --> 00:05:38,041
as it descends into chaos.

147
00:05:38,042 --> 00:05:39,609
What could possibly go wrong?

148
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:41,611
I may not be the right guy to represent

149
00:05:41,612 --> 00:05:42,879
the department, ma'am.

150
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,514
I'm not agreeing to anything
moronically provocative.

151
00:05:44,515 --> 00:05:46,983
Sounds like a good policy.

152
00:05:46,984 --> 00:05:49,852
I want to see my kid grow up.

153
00:05:49,853 --> 00:05:52,120
Me, too.

154
00:05:53,356 --> 00:05:55,690
I think you're the guy for the job.

155
00:05:57,527 --> 00:05:59,529
Okay, then.

156
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:01,564
Thank you.

157
00:06:01,565 --> 00:06:03,365
Madam Secretary.

158
00:06:10,273 --> 00:06:13,108
- (knocking)
- HENRY:<i> Yeah.</i>

159
00:06:14,176 --> 00:06:16,379
Dmitri. Come on in.

160
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:18,446
What can I do for you?

161
00:06:19,915 --> 00:06:22,785
I am on my way to the
commandant's office.

162
00:06:22,786 --> 00:06:25,420
I must withdraw from the War College.

163
00:06:26,222 --> 00:06:27,490
I'm sorry to hear that.

164
00:06:27,491 --> 00:06:29,525
Well, do you mind if I ask why?

165
00:06:29,526 --> 00:06:31,026
(sighs)

166
00:06:31,027 --> 00:06:35,631
My sister Talia... uh, she is ill. Cancer.

167
00:06:35,632 --> 00:06:36,866
Oh, no.

168
00:06:36,867 --> 00:06:38,968
Our parents are gone, so...

169
00:06:38,969 --> 00:06:41,337
I must make sure she is cared for.

170
00:06:41,338 --> 00:06:43,205
Of course, of course.

171
00:06:43,206 --> 00:06:44,607
Well, I-I want you to know

172
00:06:44,608 --> 00:06:47,476
that I greatly appreciate
your perspective in class.

173
00:06:47,477 --> 00:06:49,278
I just finished reading your

174
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:51,513
religious conflicts with
military duty paper,

175
00:06:51,514 --> 00:06:56,618
and it is... a smart,
original take on a very

176
00:06:56,619 --> 00:06:58,454
complex subject.

177
00:06:58,455 --> 00:07:00,856
You'll-you'll be missed.
You really will, by everyone.

178
00:07:00,857 --> 00:07:03,792
My best wishes for you and your sister.

179
00:07:03,793 --> 00:07:07,161
Thank you. Thank you.

180
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,503
(door opens, closes)

181
00:07:14,504 --> 00:07:16,271
Tom Garrity's wife Emma got worried

182
00:07:16,272 --> 00:07:18,340
when he didn't call
the kids this morning.

183
00:07:18,341 --> 00:07:20,175
She contacted the embassy in Kabul,

184
00:07:20,176 --> 00:07:23,679
and the deputy chief of
mission kicked her over to us.

185
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,080
- Tell her the truth.
- Right.

186
00:07:25,081 --> 00:07:27,449
- But ask for her discretion.
- Of course.

187
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:28,717
- For her husband's sake.
- Yeah.

188
00:07:28,718 --> 00:07:30,417
Madam Secretary.

189
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,255
We just received a video

190
00:07:33,256 --> 00:07:35,157
of the kidnappers' demands
via encrypted e-mail.

191
00:07:35,158 --> 00:07:37,959
Why didn't they just
post it on a Web site

192
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,160
like every other
self-respecting kidnapper?

193
00:07:40,161 --> 00:07:40,862
Watch.

194
00:07:40,863 --> 00:07:42,864
My name is Tom Garrity.

195
00:07:42,865 --> 00:07:45,867
I'm an American State Department
foreign service officer

196
00:07:45,868 --> 00:07:47,936
stationed in Kabul.

197
00:07:47,937 --> 00:07:50,572
U.S. government has gravely
wronged my captors,

198
00:07:50,573 --> 00:07:53,742
and I will be killed if
you don't make it right.

199
00:07:53,743 --> 00:07:54,976
We demand to talk

200
00:07:54,977 --> 00:07:57,645
to Secretary of State
Elizabeth McCord directly

201
00:07:57,646 --> 00:08:00,115
by midnight in Kabul tonight.

202
00:08:00,116 --> 00:08:03,718
Do as we say, or he dies.

203
00:08:03,719 --> 00:08:06,521
That's four hours from now.

204
00:08:06,522 --> 00:08:11,024
Why aren't they asking for
money or a prisoner exchange?

205
00:08:11,826 --> 00:08:14,761
Why the hell do they want to talk to me?

206
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:19,234
JANE: Dmitri's story checks out.

207
00:08:19,235 --> 00:08:21,135
His sister Talia was admitted

208
00:08:21,136 --> 00:08:23,838
to Muromskaya Hospital
with advanced fibrosarcoma

209
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:25,039
of the bone.

210
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,307
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

211
00:08:26,308 --> 00:08:28,543
It's bad luck.

212
00:08:28,544 --> 00:08:31,379
For who? For us, or for Dmitri's sister?

213
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:33,113
Both.

214
00:08:34,248 --> 00:08:37,518
So I assume you'll want to
focus on Ivan Kolashkov again?

215
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:40,321
- Yes.
- I still have reservations.

216
00:08:40,322 --> 00:08:41,622
Of course you do.

217
00:08:41,623 --> 00:08:43,357
Let me rephrase.

218
00:08:43,358 --> 00:08:45,393
I won't do it.

219
00:08:45,394 --> 00:08:47,628
You threaten to expose
he's gay to his superiors,

220
00:08:47,629 --> 00:08:48,829
who knows what he'll do?

221
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:50,498
It's just too volatile.

222
00:08:50,499 --> 00:08:51,832
The DNI needs a Russian asset

223
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:53,200
with access to General Doroshevich.

224
00:08:53,201 --> 00:08:54,402
It's a top priority now,

225
00:08:54,403 --> 00:08:56,537
especially with all
this Ostrov business.

226
00:08:56,538 --> 00:09:00,140
Ivan and Dmitri are both
in his chain of command.

227
00:09:01,342 --> 00:09:04,478
Maybe there's still a way
to make it work with Dmitri.

228
00:09:04,479 --> 00:09:06,747
LUCY: <i>The president's expecting you,</i>

229
00:09:06,748 --> 00:09:08,582
Madam Secretary. Please go right in.

230
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:10,151
- Thanks, Lucy.
- Bess.

231
00:09:10,152 --> 00:09:11,585
Hi. We meeting somewhere else?

232
00:09:11,586 --> 00:09:13,754
No, we have a cyber security briefing.

233
00:09:13,755 --> 00:09:15,189
How's it going with that?

234
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:17,458
- They're still tearing my plane apart.
- We should go, sir.

235
00:09:17,459 --> 00:09:18,726
- Yeah.
- Um, I'll walk with you.

236
00:09:18,727 --> 00:09:20,394
Uh, not necessary.
Craig will fill you in.

237
00:09:20,395 --> 00:09:21,894
Uh, use my office.

238
00:09:22,997 --> 00:09:25,366
ELIZABETH: <i>Where are we, Admiral?</i>

239
00:09:25,367 --> 00:09:28,202
Ma'am, so far, the
investigation has revealed

240
00:09:28,203 --> 00:09:31,071
that Garrity was taken in a secure zone,

241
00:09:31,072 --> 00:09:34,942
requiring a key card swipe to enter.

242
00:09:34,943 --> 00:09:36,310
So they stole them?

243
00:09:36,311 --> 00:09:38,579
Yes, the key cards
belong to three Afghans

244
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,881
who are contracting for the U.S.

245
00:09:40,882 --> 00:09:42,549
Are they dead?

246
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:44,484
They and their families are M.I.A.

247
00:09:44,485 --> 00:09:47,788
Bodies were likely
dumped outside the city.

248
00:09:47,789 --> 00:09:51,625
It's an awful lot of work to
grab one low-value American.

249
00:09:51,626 --> 00:09:53,659
What are we missing?

250
00:09:55,629 --> 00:09:58,165
Well...

251
00:09:58,166 --> 00:10:01,001
I guess they'll have
to tell us themselves.

252
00:10:01,002 --> 00:10:03,022
Absolutely not. (clears his throat)

253
00:10:03,837 --> 00:10:05,205
Excuse me?

254
00:10:05,206 --> 00:10:06,973
We don't negotiate with terrorists.

255
00:10:06,974 --> 00:10:08,408
Talking isn't negotiating.

256
00:10:08,409 --> 00:10:10,343
Well, I've already advised
the president on this,

257
00:10:10,344 --> 00:10:12,712
and he agreed. We're not
giving in to their demand.

258
00:10:12,713 --> 00:10:13,947
Did you advice the president

259
00:10:13,948 --> 00:10:15,949
we might gain valuable
Intel by engaging them?

260
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:17,183
I understand

261
00:10:17,184 --> 00:10:19,619
your sympathies, given that
Garrity is one of yours...

262
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:22,322
Garrity is an American citizen.

263
00:10:22,323 --> 00:10:25,225
I don't need your understanding.

264
00:10:25,226 --> 00:10:27,059
Ever.

265
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:30,730
Please keep me informed, Ellen.

266
00:10:30,731 --> 00:10:33,944
Yes, ma'am.

267
00:10:33,945 --> 00:10:40,203

by awaqeded for www.addic7ed.com.

268
00:10:54,447 --> 00:10:55,289
NADINE: Madam Secretary.

269
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:57,056
How'd it go with Garrity's wife?

270
00:10:57,057 --> 00:10:59,158
Uh, she's devastated, but she gets it.

271
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:02,061
There's been a change to the
merchant marines ceremony

272
00:11:02,062 --> 00:11:03,629
this afternoon.

273
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:06,065
Foreign Minister Gorev
will now be attending.

274
00:11:06,066 --> 00:11:07,366
Since when?

275
00:11:07,367 --> 00:11:10,036
We were just informed he's
on a plane from Moscow.

276
00:11:10,037 --> 00:11:13,139
Does he have any other business in town?

277
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:14,673
Nothing official.

278
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,842
It's hard to believe there's
anything wrong with Ostrov

279
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:19,045
if Gorev's leaving
Russia, but then again,

280
00:11:19,046 --> 00:11:21,347
it has been a very strange day.

281
00:11:21,348 --> 00:11:23,616
Let's see if I can get
some time alone with him.

282
00:11:23,617 --> 00:11:25,083
Yes, ma'am.

283
00:11:28,114 --> 00:11:29,103
(over phone): Hey, it's Stevie.

284
00:11:29,104 --> 00:11:30,838
You can leave a message, but you really

285
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:32,005
- should be texting me.
- (beep)

286
00:11:32,006 --> 00:11:34,808
Hey, sweetie. Um, I
already tried texting.

287
00:11:34,809 --> 00:11:36,877
I stopped by Georgetown
to take you to lunch,

288
00:11:36,878 --> 00:11:39,012
but you weren't in your econ class.

289
00:11:39,013 --> 00:11:41,281
Look, I'm sorry things
got heated this morning.

290
00:11:41,282 --> 00:11:44,517
Would you please give me a call?
I love you. Bye.

291
00:11:46,787 --> 00:11:50,524
(indistinct sportscast playing on TV)

292
00:11:50,525 --> 00:11:53,025
(people cheering)

293
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:57,597
Professor.

294
00:11:57,598 --> 00:11:59,232
You got a minute?

295
00:11:59,233 --> 00:12:01,802
Uh, of course, yeah. My
flight isn't until tomorrow.

296
00:12:01,803 --> 00:12:03,402
Oh, good.

297
00:12:06,439 --> 00:12:08,208
I want to talk about your sister.

298
00:12:08,209 --> 00:12:09,875
Okay.

299
00:12:12,078 --> 00:12:15,849
What if there was something
we could do to help her?

300
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:17,817
But-but she's already in hospital.

301
00:12:17,818 --> 00:12:20,085
No. I-I mean a cure.

302
00:12:23,156 --> 00:12:26,659
There's a drug trial happening
right now in Stockholm.

303
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:28,762
It's showing very promising results

304
00:12:28,763 --> 00:12:31,363
in young fibrosarcoma
patients like your sister.

305
00:12:33,066 --> 00:12:37,069
I didn't tell you she has
fibrosarcoma. What is this?

306
00:12:38,872 --> 00:12:42,208
My government can get
Talia a spot in the trial

307
00:12:42,209 --> 00:12:44,869
if you're willing to work with us.

308
00:12:45,545 --> 00:12:47,080
Work...

309
00:12:47,081 --> 00:12:48,548
Do you understand what I'm saying?

310
00:12:48,549 --> 00:12:51,417
Oh, my God.

311
00:12:51,418 --> 00:12:55,188
Oh, my God, you-you are
asking me to be a spy.

312
00:12:55,189 --> 00:12:57,657
Look at me. I'm offering you a chance

313
00:12:57,658 --> 00:12:59,135
to save your sister's life.

314
00:12:59,136 --> 00:13:00,059
No, they will kill me, okay?

315
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:01,704
They'll never know you had
anything to do with it.

316
00:13:01,705 --> 00:13:02,806
How do you know my comrades

317
00:13:02,807 --> 00:13:04,040
- are not listening to us now?
- Because we're careful,

318
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:05,641
that's why. They had the
room swept for bugs

319
00:13:05,642 --> 00:13:07,043
- while you were at lunch.
- Whoa, whoa, stop.

320
00:13:07,044 --> 00:13:08,377
- We're very good at protecting...
- S-Stop.

321
00:13:08,378 --> 00:13:11,213
This-this is why you give me
good grades, praise my work.

322
00:13:11,214 --> 00:13:13,416
No. I chose you because of your work.

323
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:16,185
You want a functional
democracy in Russia

324
00:13:16,186 --> 00:13:17,920
more than any officer
in the Russian army.

325
00:13:17,921 --> 00:13:20,923
This is how we get there.

326
00:13:20,924 --> 00:13:22,825
By betraying my country.

327
00:13:22,826 --> 00:13:26,362
The architect of the Soviet Union,

328
00:13:26,363 --> 00:13:27,897
Vladimir Lenin himself,

329
00:13:27,898 --> 00:13:30,699
said, "Sometimes history needs a push."

330
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,347
Your country's current
aggression will only

331
00:13:32,348 --> 00:13:35,404
lead to a further crippled
economy and endless wars.

332
00:13:35,405 --> 00:13:37,006
You know that.
But if you work with us,

333
00:13:37,007 --> 00:13:39,108
we can give Russia the push it needs

334
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:41,075
to ensure a better future.

335
00:13:42,378 --> 00:13:44,480
No.

336
00:13:44,481 --> 00:13:46,648
No, you misjudge me.

337
00:13:46,649 --> 00:13:48,684
I would never do this.

338
00:13:48,685 --> 00:13:50,052
What about your sister?

339
00:13:50,053 --> 00:13:51,386
She is patriot.

340
00:13:51,387 --> 00:13:53,621
She loves Mother Russia.

341
00:13:56,191 --> 00:13:58,526
You cannot use her like some pawn.

342
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:05,000
We have a couple minutes, ma'am.

343
00:14:05,001 --> 00:14:06,667
Thank you.

344
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:09,871
Minister Gorev.

345
00:14:09,872 --> 00:14:11,306
- Secretary McCord.
- Welcome.

346
00:14:11,307 --> 00:14:14,009
I didn't know that you were coming.

347
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:16,545
I was very surprised... pleasantly.

348
00:14:16,546 --> 00:14:18,246
Thank you. I wanted to
join you in commemorating

349
00:14:18,247 --> 00:14:20,782
our historic alliance against fascism.

350
00:14:20,783 --> 00:14:23,151
And it's a chance to see my
beautiful daughter, Olga.

351
00:14:23,152 --> 00:14:24,419
Papa.

352
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:26,321
Olga, it's very nice to meet you.

353
00:14:26,322 --> 00:14:28,557
I understand that you recently started

354
00:14:28,558 --> 00:14:30,625
at Harvard Business School?

355
00:14:30,626 --> 00:14:33,028
Indeed. You talk about me at work.

356
00:14:33,029 --> 00:14:35,196
Talking about our families
is a good ice-breaker.

357
00:14:35,197 --> 00:14:37,132
Yes, it's often

358
00:14:37,133 --> 00:14:39,834
the only pleasant things we
have to say to each other.

359
00:14:39,835 --> 00:14:42,136
Really?

360
00:14:43,271 --> 00:14:45,773
(playing somber melody)

361
00:15:00,755 --> 00:15:03,391
So, you want to tell me

362
00:15:03,392 --> 00:15:06,861
if we should be worried
about President Ostrov?

363
00:15:06,862 --> 00:15:09,530
Will you believe me if I say no?

364
00:15:09,531 --> 00:15:13,868
Well, I'd like to think that
we've built up some trust.

365
00:15:13,869 --> 00:15:16,537
As do I.

366
00:15:16,538 --> 00:15:19,907
I heard about your foreign
service officer in Afghanistan.

367
00:15:19,908 --> 00:15:22,977
Really?

368
00:15:22,978 --> 00:15:25,146
Terrible business.

369
00:15:25,147 --> 00:15:27,948
GRU may have some information.

370
00:15:31,152 --> 00:15:33,154
Huh.

371
00:15:33,155 --> 00:15:35,455
Well...

372
00:15:37,058 --> 00:15:39,160
...wonder what it will cost me.

373
00:15:39,161 --> 00:15:41,428
Mm.

374
00:15:43,864 --> 00:15:46,132
(band continues playing)

375
00:15:47,668 --> 00:15:49,235
Mm...

376
00:15:51,005 --> 00:15:52,840
Excuse me, Madam Secretary.

377
00:15:52,841 --> 00:15:55,176
Madam Secretary.

378
00:15:55,177 --> 00:15:56,310
Do you have a minute?

379
00:15:56,311 --> 00:15:58,212
- Yes, of course.
- May I?

380
00:15:58,213 --> 00:15:59,747
- Yes, ma'am.
- Great. Okay.

381
00:15:59,748 --> 00:16:02,416
ELIZABETH: <i>Conrad's all
about his new golden boy,</i>

382
00:16:02,417 --> 00:16:04,618
and I'm stuck playing second fiddle.

383
00:16:04,619 --> 00:16:08,622
More like they took my fiddle
and gave it to Craig Sterling.

384
00:16:08,623 --> 00:16:10,624
So are you telling me

385
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:13,160
that the president has given you

386
00:16:13,161 --> 00:16:15,461
the Heisman?

387
00:16:16,263 --> 00:16:17,931
Yes. Yes.

388
00:16:17,932 --> 00:16:20,000
Which is pretty galling, considering

389
00:16:20,001 --> 00:16:23,437
that I-I didn't even want the
stupid job in the first place.

390
00:16:23,438 --> 00:16:25,272
No offense.

391
00:16:25,273 --> 00:16:27,007
It's a tough job, there's no question.

392
00:16:27,008 --> 00:16:29,409
But I loved it, and I suspect

393
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:30,711
that you do, too.

394
00:16:30,712 --> 00:16:32,746
Well, admittedly, it has grown on me.

395
00:16:32,747 --> 00:16:34,748
But now that I feel like
I've been relegated

396
00:16:34,749 --> 00:16:37,484
to the outer sanctum, I...

397
00:16:37,485 --> 00:16:39,553
How do I get back in?

398
00:16:39,554 --> 00:16:41,555
You do know about my Doability Doctrine?

399
00:16:41,556 --> 00:16:43,590
I do. "Where our interests are clear,

400
00:16:43,591 --> 00:16:45,459
"our values are at stake

401
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:47,094
"and we can make a difference,

402
00:16:47,095 --> 00:16:48,762
we must act and we must lead."

403
00:16:48,763 --> 00:16:50,101
Right. And that

404
00:16:50,102 --> 00:16:52,336
doesn't apply just to
international politics.

405
00:16:52,337 --> 00:16:55,005
It applies to office politics, too.

406
00:16:55,006 --> 00:16:58,642
Look, there's plenty of room
in the world for mediocre men.

407
00:16:58,643 --> 00:17:01,846
There is no room for mediocre women.

408
00:17:01,847 --> 00:17:04,248
And so you have to lead.

409
00:17:04,249 --> 00:17:06,584
That's a little difficult

410
00:17:06,585 --> 00:17:08,552
now that the president has...

411
00:17:08,553 --> 00:17:11,922
obviously made up his mind and
gone along with Sterling.

412
00:17:11,923 --> 00:17:13,357
If you're gonna go down,

413
00:17:13,358 --> 00:17:15,059
then you've got to fight. Hard.

414
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:17,728
And you got to hit him where it hurts.

415
00:17:17,729 --> 00:17:19,063
Oh, my God.

416
00:17:19,064 --> 00:17:22,166
I hope I never get on your bad side.

417
00:17:22,167 --> 00:17:24,368
So, listen, let me call Condi

418
00:17:24,369 --> 00:17:26,703
- and let's grab lunch.
- Okay.

419
00:17:26,704 --> 00:17:28,971
Alexis, let's go.

420
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:35,112
Harrison.

421
00:17:35,113 --> 00:17:37,648
Dr. McCord. Uh, I was
hoping Stevie was here.

422
00:17:37,649 --> 00:17:39,950
Did you guys talk today?

423
00:17:39,951 --> 00:17:43,220
No. She's not answering
my calls or texts,

424
00:17:43,221 --> 00:17:45,422
hence the desperate
showing up at your house.

425
00:17:45,423 --> 00:17:48,692
Well, she's not here.

426
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:50,394
Okay.

427
00:17:50,395 --> 00:17:52,629
Uh... sorry to bother you.

428
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:54,798
Actually, why don't you come in?

429
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:58,100
There's something you
and I need to talk about.

430
00:17:59,503 --> 00:18:01,270
Come in.

431
00:18:05,976 --> 00:18:07,811
Okay, thanks.

432
00:18:07,812 --> 00:18:11,414
Madam Secretary, Admiral Hill
is sending new security video

433
00:18:11,415 --> 00:18:12,882
of the Garrity abduction.

434
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:15,485
It's ten minutes until
the kidnappers' deadline.

435
00:18:15,486 --> 00:18:17,953
Let's-let's pull it up.

436
00:18:19,823 --> 00:18:21,658
BLAKE: The guy's fighting for his life.

437
00:18:21,659 --> 00:18:25,093
ELIZABETH: You would be, too.
But then he stops.

438
00:18:25,929 --> 00:18:27,664
- Uh, play that back.
- Yeah.

439
00:18:27,665 --> 00:18:29,865
Here's the other camera.

440
00:18:34,771 --> 00:18:36,906
He has to know, if
he gets in that car,

441
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:40,475
he's... done. So why give in?

442
00:18:41,744 --> 00:18:44,046
Because he knows them.

443
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:47,450
That's why they had government I.D.'s

444
00:18:47,451 --> 00:18:50,953
and knew their way around a secure area.

445
00:18:50,954 --> 00:18:52,922
And that's why their
families aren't home.

446
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:55,324
They're not terrorists, they...

447
00:18:55,325 --> 00:18:57,093
They didn't kill the Afghans

448
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:59,862
that work for the U.S.
and steal their I.D.'s.

449
00:18:59,863 --> 00:19:01,964
They are them.

450
00:19:01,965 --> 00:19:03,866
But why take Garrity hostage?

451
00:19:03,867 --> 00:19:05,868
No idea. Why don't you

452
00:19:05,869 --> 00:19:08,371
get him on the phone and I'll ask him.

453
00:19:08,372 --> 00:19:09,805
Uh... president said not to.

454
00:19:09,806 --> 00:19:11,786
You want to check with him first?

455
00:19:13,342 --> 00:19:14,977
Definitely.

456
00:19:14,978 --> 00:19:16,946
But we don't have time, so...

457
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:19,247
would you just do that, okay?

458
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,388
Are you sure it's them, ma'am?

459
00:19:26,389 --> 00:19:28,890
65%.

460
00:19:31,827 --> 00:19:34,128
Make the call.

461
00:19:43,133 --> 00:19:44,501
Does dialing make me an accessory

462
00:19:44,502 --> 00:19:46,180
- to presidential insubordination?
- Yes.

463
00:19:46,181 --> 00:19:47,604
- Hurry up, please.
- I'm... trying.

464
00:19:47,605 --> 00:19:48,465
It didn't go through.

465
00:19:48,466 --> 00:19:51,539
What do you... what do you
mean, it didn't go through?

466
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:52,539
I don't know. I'm gonna try again.

467
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:52,776
We have two minutes

468
00:19:52,777 --> 00:19:53,821
until the kidnappers' deadline.

469
00:19:53,822 --> 00:19:55,278
I-I'm sure the network
is just overwhelmed.

470
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:56,095
Hold on.

471
00:19:56,096 --> 00:19:59,206
Seriously? What, do we
need to upgrade our plan?

472
00:19:59,207 --> 00:20:01,108
- What is happening?
- I don't know. Hold on.

473
00:20:01,109 --> 00:20:02,376
Here's the file for the contractors.

474
00:20:02,377 --> 00:20:05,178
Let me see their I.D. photos, please.

475
00:20:05,179 --> 00:20:07,280
Let's hope this is who
we're gonna be speaking to.

476
00:20:07,281 --> 00:20:09,448
It's going through.

477
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:12,486
Come on.

478
00:20:12,487 --> 00:20:14,721
Ma'am, it's them.

479
00:20:14,722 --> 00:20:16,089
Secretary McCord,

480
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:17,224
we didn't think you'd call.

481
00:20:17,225 --> 00:20:18,991
I need to see Garrity.

482
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:23,630
How you doing, Tom?

483
00:20:23,631 --> 00:20:25,865
Tell my wife and kids I love them.

484
00:20:25,866 --> 00:20:29,469
Why are you guys doing this?
You're on our side.

485
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:33,473
We have worked for the United
States military for 11 years.

486
00:20:33,474 --> 00:20:36,409
Your people promised we'd get
visas to bring our families

487
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:40,113
to the U.S., but we are always denied.

488
00:20:40,114 --> 00:20:42,982
Now the Taliban is
threatening to kill us

489
00:20:42,983 --> 00:20:45,652
and our families because we helped you.

490
00:20:45,653 --> 00:20:48,488
They posted night letters
to our doors last week

491
00:20:48,489 --> 00:20:50,290
saying they would cut
our children's throats

492
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:52,058
in front of us first.

493
00:20:52,059 --> 00:20:54,527
We asked the American
embassy for protection,

494
00:20:54,528 --> 00:20:56,529
but they turned us away.

495
00:20:56,530 --> 00:21:00,399
You made us do this. We had no choice.

496
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:03,036
What do you want?

497
00:21:03,037 --> 00:21:04,737
We know we are criminals now.

498
00:21:04,738 --> 00:21:07,240
And we accept going
to prison in America.

499
00:21:07,241 --> 00:21:09,275
We want visas

500
00:21:09,276 --> 00:21:11,110
and transport for our wives and children

501
00:21:11,111 --> 00:21:13,880
so they can live in America
as we were promised.

502
00:21:13,881 --> 00:21:15,181
When you can prove

503
00:21:15,182 --> 00:21:17,984
that our families are safe in America,

504
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:20,352
then we will free Mr. Garrity.

505
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:23,055
MATT: <i>August 2014,</i>

506
00:21:23,056 --> 00:21:26,893
January 2015 and,
finally, two months ago.

507
00:21:26,894 --> 00:21:29,061
They were rejected seven times.

508
00:21:29,062 --> 00:21:31,163
They hit all the benchmarks for visas...

509
00:21:31,164 --> 00:21:33,132
recommendation letters
from U.S. commanders,

510
00:21:33,133 --> 00:21:35,134
proof that they received
a credible threat

511
00:21:35,135 --> 00:21:36,635
as a result of their employment.

512
00:21:36,636 --> 00:21:38,604
No blemishes on any of their records.

513
00:21:38,605 --> 00:21:39,939
Seem like stand-up guys.

514
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:42,475
Not withstanding kidnapping
and threatening to kill Garrity.

515
00:21:42,476 --> 00:21:43,909
So why were they denied?

516
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:46,245
NADINE: In 2008, an Afghan contractor

517
00:21:46,246 --> 00:21:50,115
for the U.S. ended up on
the terrorist watchlist.

518
00:21:50,116 --> 00:21:52,051
Lawmakers went crazy.

519
00:21:52,052 --> 00:21:54,453
The intelligence
community put the brakes

520
00:21:54,454 --> 00:21:58,424
on virtually every visa
from Afghanistan and Iraq.

521
00:21:58,425 --> 00:22:00,793
Even though we kept making promises

522
00:22:00,794 --> 00:22:02,428
to the locals who worked for us.

523
00:22:02,429 --> 00:22:04,029
And they kept getting killed.

524
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:05,731
The next time I have
to tell Russell Jackson

525
00:22:05,732 --> 00:22:09,368
that I went against POTUS's
wishes, someone please...

526
00:22:09,369 --> 00:22:12,336
- Shoot you?
- (chuckles)

527
00:22:14,139 --> 00:22:17,509
Any idea if the president is
inclined to take their offer?

528
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:19,444
I doubt it.

529
00:22:19,445 --> 00:22:22,648
- I'm a flawed messenger.
- Well, they all had

530
00:22:22,649 --> 00:22:27,019
the same commanding officer who
vouched for them on their visas.

531
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:30,254
Lieutenant Colonel Mike Wilkerson.

532
00:22:43,969 --> 00:22:45,771
Colonel Wilkerson?

533
00:22:45,772 --> 00:22:47,439
- Secretary.
- Hey.

534
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,774
Thank you for letting me stop by

535
00:22:49,775 --> 00:22:52,209
- on such short notice.
- Absolutely, ma'am. Come on up.

536
00:22:53,178 --> 00:22:55,380
- Who's this?
- This is Kulcha.

537
00:22:55,381 --> 00:22:58,415
- Say hello, Kulcha.
- Hey, darling.

538
00:22:59,351 --> 00:23:02,721
I mean, I'm-I'm shocked.

539
00:23:02,722 --> 00:23:05,190
That doesn't sound like them at all.

540
00:23:05,191 --> 00:23:06,524
Certainly not

541
00:23:06,525 --> 00:23:09,627
like the guys you wrote such
glowing recommendations for.

542
00:23:09,628 --> 00:23:11,963
Yeah. To no avail, unfortunately.

543
00:23:11,964 --> 00:23:14,466
Do you think that they'd kill Garrity

544
00:23:14,467 --> 00:23:16,366
if their demands aren't met?

545
00:23:17,535 --> 00:23:19,304
I-I don't know, ma'am.

546
00:23:19,305 --> 00:23:21,739
But in the three years
these guys worked for me,

547
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:24,943
they exemplified courage
and professionalism,

548
00:23:24,944 --> 00:23:26,644
despite the danger.

549
00:23:26,645 --> 00:23:29,247
They believed they were
securing a better future

550
00:23:29,248 --> 00:23:30,748
for their country, which turned out

551
00:23:30,749 --> 00:23:33,383
to be more complicated than
any of us ever imagined.

552
00:23:35,053 --> 00:23:37,755
But if-if they're doing this,

553
00:23:37,756 --> 00:23:41,558
then I believe it's because they
didn't have any other options.

554
00:23:42,427 --> 00:23:44,629
This guy's the only uncomplicated thing

555
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:46,898
that came out of my tour.

556
00:23:46,899 --> 00:23:49,767
I found him, barely alive, on a street

557
00:23:49,768 --> 00:23:52,035
in Kandahar.

558
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:54,372
STERLING: <i>Mr. President,</i>

559
00:23:54,373 --> 00:23:55,973
your Secretary of State has gone rogue.

560
00:23:55,974 --> 00:23:58,509
I could not have been clearer
when I gave her your directive.

561
00:23:58,510 --> 00:24:01,145
Your directive was we don't
negotiate with terrorists.

562
00:24:01,146 --> 00:24:03,814
But that was when we thought
the kidnappers were Taliban.

563
00:24:03,815 --> 00:24:05,416
These guys may not have
been terrorists before,

564
00:24:05,417 --> 00:24:07,451
- but they sure act like it now.
- I believe they were pushed

565
00:24:07,452 --> 00:24:11,088
to make a terrible choice based
on desperate circumstances.

566
00:24:11,089 --> 00:24:12,523
So now you want to forgive them.

567
00:24:12,524 --> 00:24:14,792
As CIA director, you
went above and beyond

568
00:24:14,793 --> 00:24:17,661
- to protect our assets in other countries,
- I'm guessing...

569
00:24:17,662 --> 00:24:19,830
- because that was the promise we made.
- none of your former CIA assets

570
00:24:19,831 --> 00:24:22,366
- ever kidnapped an American foreign
service officer. - That was the deal.

571
00:24:22,367 --> 00:24:24,435
These men put their lives on the line,

572
00:24:24,436 --> 00:24:27,338
and they've been waiting for years.

573
00:24:27,339 --> 00:24:29,907
I spoke with their former C.O.
He still vouches for them.

574
00:24:29,908 --> 00:24:31,108
Sir...

575
00:24:31,109 --> 00:24:33,911
When he took in a stray dog in Kandahar,

576
00:24:33,912 --> 00:24:36,847
all he had to do was sign a few
forms, and it was a naturalized

577
00:24:36,848 --> 00:24:40,818
American overnight.
Is that dog less expendable?

578
00:24:40,819 --> 00:24:42,953
I mean, somehow that
system wasn't bogged down.

579
00:24:42,954 --> 00:24:45,189
Or maybe we never intended
to keep that promise.

580
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:48,725
Mr. President, the safest,
cleanest way to save Tom Garrity

581
00:24:48,726 --> 00:24:49,893
is to take the deal.

582
00:24:49,894 --> 00:24:51,128
The kidnappers will go to prison.

583
00:24:51,129 --> 00:24:54,164
That doesn't betray our policy.

584
00:24:54,165 --> 00:24:56,867
- Make it so.
- Mr. President,

585
00:24:56,868 --> 00:24:59,226
- I strongly disagree with..
- I know you do, Craig.

586
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:02,206
Now, will you give
Elizabeth and me a moment?

587
00:25:02,207 --> 00:25:04,507
Thank you, Mr. President.

588
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:08,145
Thank you, sir.

589
00:25:08,146 --> 00:25:09,780
Don't.

590
00:25:09,781 --> 00:25:12,449
Russell's argument won the day, not yours.

591
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:15,419
Works for me.

592
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:17,788
Harrison told me about the heroin

593
00:25:17,789 --> 00:25:19,322
that Stevie found on him

594
00:25:19,323 --> 00:25:22,124
and that Henry leaned on him.

595
00:25:23,827 --> 00:25:29,131
We thought that you and
Lydia would want to know.

596
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,535
I'm just sorry Stevie
had to get involved.

597
00:25:32,536 --> 00:25:34,671
No. They're close.

598
00:25:34,672 --> 00:25:36,706
They always have been.

599
00:25:36,707 --> 00:25:38,942
Now that he's 21, we can't
just send him to his room

600
00:25:38,943 --> 00:25:41,378
every time he makes a bad choice.

601
00:25:41,379 --> 00:25:44,848
We have to hope that we raised
him well enough that...

602
00:25:44,849 --> 00:25:47,950
eventually he'll make the right one.

603
00:25:50,353 --> 00:25:51,454
Thanks, Elizabeth.

604
00:25:51,455 --> 00:25:52,689
FARMIGLIA: <i>Upon hearing
Russian President</i>

605
00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:54,824
Ostrov is dead, the Pentagon
believes we should use

606
00:25:54,825 --> 00:25:57,594
the potential instability to
take a more aggressive posture.

607
00:25:57,595 --> 00:25:59,429
So your idea is to take this
fragile, paranoid country

608
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:01,197
that constantly thinks the
United States is going

609
00:26:01,198 --> 00:26:03,533
to attack them and, at their
moment of maximum vulnerability,

610
00:26:03,534 --> 00:26:06,102
validate that paranoia? That
sounds like it'll work great.

611
00:26:06,103 --> 00:26:07,589
Are you saying their
moment of weakness isn't

612
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:09,411
an opportunity to take strategic gain?

613
00:26:09,412 --> 00:26:11,240
The problem is we don't
know what it'll be,

614
00:26:11,241 --> 00:26:12,477
beyond incredibly destabilizing

615
00:26:12,478 --> 00:26:13,443
and dangerous for the whole world.

616
00:26:13,444 --> 00:26:15,778
Our primary concern
should be Intel gathering,

617
00:26:15,779 --> 00:26:18,047
trying to figure out who will
emerge as the next leader.

618
00:26:18,048 --> 00:26:19,882
Okay, so who does State like?

619
00:26:19,883 --> 00:26:21,784
As of right now, the
best we can hope for

620
00:26:21,785 --> 00:26:24,687
is Foreign Minister Gorev. He appears
to be the least hostile to the West.

621
00:26:24,688 --> 00:26:27,223
- I'm assuming Defense doesn't agree.
- Sir, we like

622
00:26:27,224 --> 00:26:29,392
General Doroshevich.
He's moderate, pragmatic.

623
00:26:29,393 --> 00:26:31,527
Last month, he joked
about nuking Grozny.

624
00:26:31,528 --> 00:26:33,616
The Joint Chiefs have been courting
him over the last several years

625
00:26:33,617 --> 00:26:35,167
at the Russian-NATO
Partnership Conference.

626
00:26:35,168 --> 00:26:37,713
Just because he had caviar on
toast points with our top brass

627
00:26:37,714 --> 00:26:39,448
doesn't make the guy
a friend to the West.

628
00:26:39,449 --> 00:26:40,850
All right, all right. Enough.

629
00:26:40,851 --> 00:26:43,685
You both need to get serious
about finding common ground.

630
00:26:46,355 --> 00:26:48,257
20 minutes ago, the president and I

631
00:26:48,258 --> 00:26:50,526
had a top secret briefing with the DNI.

632
00:26:50,527 --> 00:26:53,229
We have it on good authority that Ostrov

633
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:55,131
is in Central Clinic Hospital.

634
00:26:55,132 --> 00:26:57,432
Condition unknown.

635
00:27:00,102 --> 00:27:02,705
Consider yourselves read in.

636
00:27:02,706 --> 00:27:05,074
This isn't a drill anymore.

637
00:27:05,075 --> 00:27:07,375
Get on the same page.

638
00:27:09,078 --> 00:27:12,247
Now.

639
00:27:12,248 --> 00:27:15,217
Stevie skipped school, and
she's not returning my calls

640
00:27:15,218 --> 00:27:18,721
- or my texts, so...
- Well...

641
00:27:18,722 --> 00:27:21,690
Are we more worried
about her than Ostrov?

642
00:27:21,691 --> 00:27:24,526
I just think maybe we hit her
a little too hard this morning.

643
00:27:24,527 --> 00:27:25,961
She needs space.

644
00:27:25,962 --> 00:27:28,831
At least Harrison came
clean with his parents.

645
00:27:28,832 --> 00:27:30,832
I'm not surprised.
I've been on the receiving end

646
00:27:30,833 --> 00:27:35,036
of your persuasion...
resistance is futile.

647
00:27:37,673 --> 00:27:40,841
What? Are you okay? I strike a nerve?

648
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:44,780
Uh, no. Just a work thing.

649
00:27:44,781 --> 00:27:46,981
You want to talk about it?

650
00:27:48,216 --> 00:27:50,819
Ah. That work.

651
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:52,954
Sorry to interrupt. Uh, the
families have been secured

652
00:27:52,955 --> 00:27:55,357
and are being taken to Bagram Airfield.

653
00:27:55,358 --> 00:27:57,858
And you're needed in the Sit Room.

654
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:01,930
Thank you.

655
00:28:01,931 --> 00:28:03,965
We definitely need to plan a vacation.

656
00:28:03,966 --> 00:28:07,235
I mean it. Something...
without the kids.

657
00:28:07,236 --> 00:28:10,338
No cell service, Internet,

658
00:28:10,339 --> 00:28:13,408
- no people, except maybe a masseuse.
- Go.

659
00:28:13,409 --> 00:28:16,711
- And a chef.
- Go.

660
00:28:16,712 --> 00:28:18,979
(sighs)

661
00:28:20,515 --> 00:28:22,884
HILL: <i>HUMINT helped uncover
the location of Garrity</i>

662
00:28:22,885 --> 00:28:26,221
and the kidnappers. They're
in an abandoned cement plant

663
00:28:26,222 --> 00:28:28,289
32 miles outside Kabul.

664
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:30,458
What's the source of that intelligence?

665
00:28:30,459 --> 00:28:31,559
Russian GRU.

666
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:34,629
DIA confirmed its authenticity.

667
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:36,831
Mr. President, I have
a SEAL team en route.

668
00:28:36,832 --> 00:28:38,299
- What's our posture?
- We stick to the plan.

669
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:41,135
Observe from a distance, and,
when the families reach Andrews,

670
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:42,704
we pick up Garrity and his captors.

671
00:28:42,705 --> 00:28:44,806
Gorev told me he might
have some Intel for us.

672
00:28:44,807 --> 00:28:46,708
Pretty amazing he came through.

673
00:28:46,709 --> 00:28:48,376
If Ostrov's dead,

674
00:28:48,377 --> 00:28:50,878
could be an auspicious beginning
to our new relationship.

675
00:28:50,879 --> 00:28:55,550
If Gorev emerges from the power
vacuum with the big job.

676
00:28:55,551 --> 00:28:57,585
Mr. President, a heavily
armed Taliban unit

677
00:28:57,586 --> 00:28:59,800
is moving toward Garrity and
the kidnappers in a hurry.

678
00:28:59,801 --> 00:29:00,755
ELIZABETH: They're made.

679
00:29:00,756 --> 00:29:02,404
- Damn it.
- How far out are they, Admiral?

680
00:29:02,405 --> 00:29:03,338
Uh, about two hours.

681
00:29:03,339 --> 00:29:04,673
How fast can the SEALs get there?

682
00:29:04,674 --> 00:29:06,375
Also two hours, sir.

683
00:29:06,376 --> 00:29:09,176
I hope the good guys get there first.

684
00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:19,986
SEAL team is aware of
the Taliban incursion,

685
00:29:19,987 --> 00:29:21,845
Mr. President, and are
balls to the wall.

686
00:29:21,846 --> 00:29:22,979
95 minutes to the target.

687
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:24,647
And the Taliban unit, are we gonna

688
00:29:24,648 --> 00:29:25,848
- beat them there?
- Too close to call.

689
00:29:25,849 --> 00:29:27,116
We have to warn them.

690
00:29:27,117 --> 00:29:28,851
- We have to tell them to move.
- Tell them we know

691
00:29:28,852 --> 00:29:30,119
where they are,
they'll think it's a ploy.

692
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,487
Not to mention, it'll blow

693
00:29:31,488 --> 00:29:32,889
- the element of surprise.
- Which won't matter

694
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:34,991
if the Taliban get there first.

695
00:29:34,992 --> 00:29:36,125
DALTON: I'd agree with you, Bess,

696
00:29:36,126 --> 00:29:37,660
but we promised them that their families

697
00:29:37,661 --> 00:29:39,729
would be safe in the U.S.
before they surrender.

698
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:41,030
I don't see how they're
going to trust us

699
00:29:41,031 --> 00:29:42,698
if we change the rules of the game now.

700
00:29:42,699 --> 00:29:44,500
- They won't.
- I agree.

701
00:29:44,501 --> 00:29:46,102
We haven't exactly built up

702
00:29:46,103 --> 00:29:48,137
a reserve of trust with these guys.

703
00:29:48,138 --> 00:29:49,138
But...

704
00:29:49,139 --> 00:29:51,874
I might know a guy who has.

705
00:29:51,875 --> 00:29:54,175
(line ringing)

706
00:29:57,213 --> 00:29:59,348
- Hello?
- Ishaq.

707
00:29:59,349 --> 00:30:01,283
It's Mike Wilkerson.

708
00:30:01,284 --> 00:30:03,052
- It's been a while, huh?
- Oh, my God.

709
00:30:03,053 --> 00:30:05,187
- What's going on?
- Everything's fine.

710
00:30:05,188 --> 00:30:08,123
Your family and Falal's and-and
Jawdah's are all on a plane

711
00:30:08,124 --> 00:30:09,758
- to Maryland. They're safe.
- Then why this?

712
00:30:09,759 --> 00:30:11,427
- Why are you calling?
- I'm here with the president

713
00:30:11,428 --> 00:30:13,195
and the Secretary of State.

714
00:30:13,196 --> 00:30:15,764
They've promised that the United
States is gonna honor its deal

715
00:30:15,765 --> 00:30:17,800
with you, but something
unexpected has come up.

716
00:30:17,801 --> 00:30:19,501
What? What unexpected?

717
00:30:19,502 --> 00:30:21,883
The Taliban are coming for you.
They'll be there

718
00:30:21,884 --> 00:30:23,617
in less than 15 minutes.

719
00:30:23,618 --> 00:30:24,684
You know where we are?

720
00:30:24,685 --> 00:30:25,785
Yes. In Gul Bagh.

721
00:30:25,786 --> 00:30:27,087
- At the old cement plant.
- My God.

722
00:30:27,088 --> 00:30:28,688
(Ishaq speaking Dari)

723
00:30:28,689 --> 00:30:30,357
Ishaq, listen to me.

724
00:30:30,358 --> 00:30:32,259
Listen to me. Stay with me.

725
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:33,360
The good news is there's

726
00:30:33,361 --> 00:30:34,861
an American unit heading to pick you up.

727
00:30:34,862 --> 00:30:36,763
No. Not before our families

728
00:30:36,764 --> 00:30:38,531
- are in the United States.
- Not enough time.

729
00:30:38,532 --> 00:30:41,568
Now, the president and secretary
have given me their word

730
00:30:41,569 --> 00:30:43,203
your families will be taken care of.

731
00:30:43,204 --> 00:30:45,805
Mike, please.

732
00:30:45,806 --> 00:30:47,440
You know my children.

733
00:30:47,441 --> 00:30:48,475
We're gonna get you out of there.

734
00:30:48,476 --> 00:30:49,976
But you need to move to a safe location

735
00:30:49,977 --> 00:30:52,117
- where we can pick you up.
- (speaking Dari)

736
00:30:57,083 --> 00:30:59,194
We're running out of time.
Just give him the landing zone.

737
00:30:59,195 --> 00:31:01,487
Ishaq, there's a closed gas
station two and a quarter miles

738
00:31:01,488 --> 00:31:04,424
northeast of you.
Go there now and wait...

739
00:31:04,425 --> 00:31:05,458
What the hell?

740
00:31:05,459 --> 00:31:06,492
Sat phone lost connection.

741
00:31:06,493 --> 00:31:08,261
Can you get it back?

742
00:31:08,262 --> 00:31:09,562
Uh, negative.

743
00:31:09,563 --> 00:31:11,497
There's interference across the area.

744
00:31:11,498 --> 00:31:13,499
12 minutes until the
Taliban reaches them.

745
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:17,269
Did they even get the landing zone?

746
00:31:19,038 --> 00:31:20,506
Mr. President,

747
00:31:20,507 --> 00:31:22,908
we just got word on Ostrov.

748
00:31:23,843 --> 00:31:25,578
Okay, what if I...

749
00:31:25,579 --> 00:31:28,080
what if I give you the Ninth
Fleet in the Northern Pacific?

750
00:31:28,081 --> 00:31:29,782
- But no missiles in Poland.
- The president

751
00:31:29,783 --> 00:31:31,984
- isn't interested in half measures.
- Of course he is.

752
00:31:31,985 --> 00:31:33,319
That's the definition of "diplomacy."

753
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,221
Sounds more like the
definition of "weakness."

754
00:31:35,222 --> 00:31:37,156
Look, I'm all for projecting strength,

755
00:31:37,157 --> 00:31:39,425
but what we need to tell
the president is complicated

756
00:31:39,426 --> 00:31:41,861
and nuanced and somewhat contradictory.

757
00:31:41,862 --> 00:31:43,496
Not what I'm gonna tell him.

758
00:31:43,497 --> 00:31:45,998
You can stand down,
gentlemen. President Ostrov

759
00:31:45,999 --> 00:31:49,201
just showed up at a parade
in Saint Petersburg.

760
00:31:49,202 --> 00:31:51,237
Oh, thank God.

761
00:31:51,238 --> 00:31:53,906
Guess this report isn't
so urgent anymore.

762
00:31:53,907 --> 00:31:56,774
Though your progress is impressive.

763
00:32:00,079 --> 00:32:02,815
Rain check?

764
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:05,284
Guy's got to die sometime.

765
00:32:05,285 --> 00:32:07,585
Right?

766
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:16,762
30 seconds to landing zone. Over.

767
00:32:16,763 --> 00:32:18,664
Copy that, Commander.
Can you see the package?

768
00:32:18,665 --> 00:32:19,898
Negative.

769
00:32:19,899 --> 00:32:22,200
Descending.

770
00:32:24,002 --> 00:32:28,307
Oh, wait a second.
I have four men at the LZ.

771
00:32:28,308 --> 00:32:30,409
Can you visually confirm
the package? Over.

772
00:32:30,410 --> 00:32:32,576
Hold.

773
00:32:34,313 --> 00:32:36,949
Yes. We have visual
confirmation on the package.

774
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:38,450
- We're going down.
- Thank God, it's them.

775
00:32:38,451 --> 00:32:40,919
- They moved.
- Good call, Bess.

776
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,820
(automatic gunfire)

777
00:32:46,692 --> 00:32:48,660
- Status, Commander? Over.
- We're taking fire, ma'am.

778
00:32:48,661 --> 00:32:50,261
From who?

779
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:53,198
Commander?

780
00:32:53,199 --> 00:32:55,534
Taliban. Column with heavy artillery.

781
00:32:55,535 --> 00:32:57,235
Taliban must have been tipped

782
00:32:57,236 --> 00:32:58,270
by locals.

783
00:32:58,271 --> 00:32:59,838
(audio breaking up)

784
00:32:59,839 --> 00:33:01,473
Engaging.

785
00:33:01,474 --> 00:33:03,807
(automatic gunfire)

786
00:33:04,576 --> 00:33:06,845
Package on the move. Follow him, Pete.

787
00:33:06,846 --> 00:33:10,381
(gunfire continues)

788
00:33:13,051 --> 00:33:16,520
- That's Garrity.
- (indistinct shouting)

789
00:33:17,088 --> 00:33:18,956
Status, Commander?

790
00:33:19,691 --> 00:33:21,525
Commander?

791
00:33:24,295 --> 00:33:27,332
We have Garrity, Admiral.
Permission to evacuate? Over.

792
00:33:27,333 --> 00:33:30,000
- (heavy gunfire)
- Mr. President?

793
00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:34,772
Mr. President?

794
00:33:34,773 --> 00:33:37,175
(heavy gunfire continues)

795
00:33:37,176 --> 00:33:38,743
We cannot leave them.

796
00:33:38,744 --> 00:33:40,244
We gave them our word.

797
00:33:40,245 --> 00:33:43,314
We got our guy... we absolutely
can and should evacuate now.

798
00:33:43,315 --> 00:33:45,450
The Taliban is still our enemy.

799
00:33:45,451 --> 00:33:49,387
We have a Black Hawk
with two M-134 miniguns

800
00:33:49,388 --> 00:33:51,289
and 30 SEALs armed to the teeth

801
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:53,024
with M4 carbines!

802
00:33:53,025 --> 00:33:55,193
That is more than enough
firepower to wipe them out.

803
00:33:55,194 --> 00:33:56,294
We're taking heavy fire!

804
00:33:56,295 --> 00:33:57,929
Waiting for orders. Over.

805
00:33:57,930 --> 00:33:59,263
(heavy gunfire continues)

806
00:33:59,264 --> 00:34:01,924
CRAIG: Mr. President.

807
00:34:02,433 --> 00:34:04,068
Evacuate.

808
00:34:04,069 --> 00:34:07,371
- DALTON: Get them out of there.
- Evacuate. Permission to evacuate granted.

809
00:34:07,372 --> 00:34:08,806
Copy that, Admiral. Out.

810
00:34:08,807 --> 00:34:11,542
I can't justify spilling our
troops' blood to save them.

811
00:34:11,543 --> 00:34:13,843
(heavy gunfire continues)

812
00:34:21,952 --> 00:34:24,721
(gunfire stops)

813
00:34:45,594 --> 00:34:48,964
I'm sorry things didn't
go your way back there.

814
00:34:48,965 --> 00:34:51,867
Is that how you see it?

815
00:34:51,868 --> 00:34:54,670
Sometimes things go your
way with the president,

816
00:34:54,671 --> 00:34:56,338
sometimes they don't?

817
00:34:56,339 --> 00:34:58,040
I guess it is.

818
00:34:58,041 --> 00:35:00,075
- Whew!
- But we advise, all right?

819
00:35:00,076 --> 00:35:02,011
The president makes his decision.

820
00:35:02,012 --> 00:35:04,446
Which absolves you
of any responsibility.

821
00:35:04,447 --> 00:35:06,548
No, I take full responsibility

822
00:35:06,549 --> 00:35:09,718
- for everything I do in my job.
- Including those men's deaths?

823
00:35:09,719 --> 00:35:11,286
Because Dalton relies on his advisors,

824
00:35:11,287 --> 00:35:14,022
and I think he could have
been persuaded to save them.

825
00:35:14,023 --> 00:35:16,492
I shared with the president
exactly what I believed.

826
00:35:16,493 --> 00:35:18,994
(laughs): Really? Because...

827
00:35:18,995 --> 00:35:21,630
based on your history, I
thought you would have argued

828
00:35:21,631 --> 00:35:24,433
to take out a Taliban unit
while we had the chance.

829
00:35:24,434 --> 00:35:26,134
You made your bones at the Pentagon

830
00:35:26,135 --> 00:35:28,303
- supporting military intervention.
- You think I was

831
00:35:28,304 --> 00:35:30,205
more interested in scoring
a blow against you

832
00:35:30,206 --> 00:35:31,840
than giving the president
honest counsel?

833
00:35:31,841 --> 00:35:35,043
I'm saying it goes against
everything you've advocated

834
00:35:35,044 --> 00:35:37,311
for the last 15 years.

835
00:35:38,213 --> 00:35:40,282
Just... sharing

836
00:35:40,283 --> 00:35:43,083
with you exactly what I believe.

837
00:35:49,424 --> 00:35:50,625
HENRY: Hey.

838
00:35:50,626 --> 00:35:51,927
No texting at dinner.

839
00:35:51,928 --> 00:35:54,996
Fine, but I just read that
the urge to check your texts

840
00:35:54,997 --> 00:35:57,332
is actually more powerful than
a drug addict's urge to use.

841
00:35:57,333 --> 00:35:59,534
- Then turn it off.
- Was it Stevie?

842
00:35:59,535 --> 00:36:00,502
No.

843
00:36:00,503 --> 00:36:02,504
Have you heard from your sister?

844
00:36:02,505 --> 00:36:04,306
- Me?
- Mm.

845
00:36:04,307 --> 00:36:05,573
(door opens)

846
00:36:05,574 --> 00:36:07,642
Hi.

847
00:36:07,643 --> 00:36:09,577
- Sorry I'm late.
- Where have you been?

848
00:36:09,578 --> 00:36:10,779
Living my life.

849
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:13,548
ELIZABETH: Would it kill
you to return a text,

850
00:36:13,549 --> 00:36:15,150
- maybe call? Yes.
- Or a phone call.

851
00:36:15,151 --> 00:36:16,885
HENRY: Right now is not the time to...

852
00:36:16,886 --> 00:36:19,120
Can we skip the interrogation

853
00:36:19,121 --> 00:36:21,888
and just... eat?

854
00:36:33,101 --> 00:36:35,637
Okay, it's obvious we're in need
of some peer mediation here.

855
00:36:35,638 --> 00:36:38,306
- I happen to have my talking stick...
- And here we go.

856
00:36:38,307 --> 00:36:40,842
Speak openly and honestly

857
00:36:40,843 --> 00:36:42,944
using a lot of "I" statements.

858
00:36:42,945 --> 00:36:45,378
Mom, you can go first.

859
00:36:48,416 --> 00:36:50,418
I had a very difficult day at work,

860
00:36:50,419 --> 00:36:53,954
and I am doing my best not
to take it out on anyone.

861
00:36:54,989 --> 00:36:56,657
But I guess what I'm feeling

862
00:36:56,658 --> 00:36:59,860
mostly right now is... (sighs)

863
00:36:59,861 --> 00:37:03,764
...how vexing and difficult it is

864
00:37:03,765 --> 00:37:06,100
to be the parent of an adult.

865
00:37:06,101 --> 00:37:09,804
I have no control over
your life anymore, Stevie.

866
00:37:09,805 --> 00:37:13,273
And that scares the hell out of me.

867
00:37:13,941 --> 00:37:15,342
Oh, God.

868
00:37:15,343 --> 00:37:17,078
That was really good, Mom.

869
00:37:17,079 --> 00:37:19,012
Thank you, Noodle.

870
00:37:21,348 --> 00:37:23,650
Your turn, slugger.

871
00:37:25,786 --> 00:37:28,956
Okay, Stevie, I think you owe it
to Mom and me to explain

872
00:37:28,957 --> 00:37:30,424
what you were doing all day

873
00:37:30,425 --> 00:37:32,059
if you weren't in your
classes that we pay for.

874
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:33,560
Okay, you're spying on me?

875
00:37:33,561 --> 00:37:35,362
- No. I want you to call me back.
- Did you call my teachers and ask...?

876
00:37:35,363 --> 00:37:36,497
I texted and called you a number of times.

877
00:37:36,498 --> 00:37:38,132
Everyone needs to respect the stick.

878
00:37:38,133 --> 00:37:40,868
- And you wouldn't return my calls.
- Give me that! I took the LSAT.

879
00:37:40,869 --> 00:37:42,536
Okay? That's where I was...

880
00:37:42,537 --> 00:37:44,138
taking the LSAT.

881
00:37:44,139 --> 00:37:46,159
Isn't that the SAT for law school?

882
00:37:47,341 --> 00:37:50,010
That talk this morning
really freaked me out.

883
00:37:50,011 --> 00:37:51,745
I mean, you guys are right.

884
00:37:51,746 --> 00:37:54,515
For the past year, I have
been a total screwup.

885
00:37:54,516 --> 00:37:56,016
Dropping out of college,

886
00:37:56,017 --> 00:37:58,619
dating a recovering
addict when I knew that

887
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:00,220
it was bad for him,

888
00:38:00,221 --> 00:38:02,022
- hiding his stash.
- Wait, you did what?

889
00:38:02,023 --> 00:38:03,257
- Shh.
- I didn't like

890
00:38:03,258 --> 00:38:04,591
who I was becoming,

891
00:38:04,592 --> 00:38:06,927
and I started to question
whether I was even

892
00:38:06,928 --> 00:38:09,162
a decent person.

893
00:38:09,163 --> 00:38:10,597
So I decided

894
00:38:10,598 --> 00:38:13,900
to sign up to do something
that I knew I could do well.

895
00:38:13,901 --> 00:38:15,902
A standardized test.

896
00:38:15,903 --> 00:38:19,406
And maybe someday I can
do some good as a lawyer.

897
00:38:19,407 --> 00:38:20,640
You were having

898
00:38:20,641 --> 00:38:23,976
an identity crisis, so you took the LSAT.

899
00:38:24,878 --> 00:38:27,547
- You are such a McCord.
- ELIZABETH: Oh, honey,

900
00:38:27,548 --> 00:38:29,983
- I love you so much.
- (chuckles): Oh, baby.

901
00:38:29,984 --> 00:38:31,218
- Ah...
- I love you, too.

902
00:38:31,219 --> 00:38:33,752
Who thinks peer mediating's a joke now?

903
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:38,792
Did we push her too hard?

904
00:38:38,793 --> 00:38:41,494
We pushed her just
hard enough, apparently.

905
00:38:41,495 --> 00:38:42,629
Well, law school...

906
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:46,633
To take stock in her life;
not a bad exercise.

907
00:38:46,634 --> 00:38:48,967
So we're not horrible parents?

908
00:38:50,236 --> 00:38:52,772
Not today.

909
00:38:52,773 --> 00:38:55,073
(phone rings)

910
00:38:55,808 --> 00:38:58,511
Hello?

911
00:38:58,512 --> 00:39:00,312
Who?

912
00:39:01,014 --> 00:39:03,616
Okay, send him in.

913
00:39:03,617 --> 00:39:05,717
It's Anton Gorev.

914
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:13,925
The Russian foreign
minister's dropping by?

915
00:39:14,761 --> 00:39:17,330
Do you have any idea what this is about?

916
00:39:17,331 --> 00:39:19,297
No.

917
00:39:20,266 --> 00:39:21,901
Do you?

918
00:39:21,902 --> 00:39:23,703
I hope not.

919
00:39:23,704 --> 00:39:26,638
I-I don't like the sound of that.

920
00:39:27,507 --> 00:39:29,408
Anton. Come in.

921
00:39:29,409 --> 00:39:31,744
- Good evening, Elizabeth.
- You know Henry.

922
00:39:31,745 --> 00:39:33,779
- Of course. Professor McCord.
- Hi, Anton.

923
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:35,314
GOREV: I understand you were

924
00:39:35,315 --> 00:39:36,916
able to save your
foreign service officer.

925
00:39:36,917 --> 00:39:38,851
Yes. Yes. And thank you.

926
00:39:38,852 --> 00:39:41,253
Your help was very much appreciated.

927
00:39:41,254 --> 00:39:43,655
- Come on in, please.
- Oh. Thank you.

928
00:39:45,524 --> 00:39:48,661
I guess I-I just didn't think
that you would be coming

929
00:39:48,662 --> 00:39:51,996
to ask for something
in return so quickly.

930
00:39:53,065 --> 00:39:55,334
It's about my daughter, Olga.

931
00:39:55,335 --> 00:39:57,102
As you know, she recently started

932
00:39:57,103 --> 00:39:58,604
at Harvard Business School.

933
00:39:58,605 --> 00:40:00,829
Thanks in part to your
gentle grading, Professor.

934
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:01,540
(chuckles)

935
00:40:01,541 --> 00:40:04,076
What-what is it with Olga?

936
00:40:04,077 --> 00:40:07,246
If anything were to happen to me...

937
00:40:07,247 --> 00:40:12,550
I humbly ask that Olga's visa
to the United States be renewed.

938
00:40:13,252 --> 00:40:15,320
What are you worried about?

939
00:40:15,321 --> 00:40:16,655
(chuckles softly)

940
00:40:16,656 --> 00:40:18,057
Please, the-the visa

941
00:40:18,058 --> 00:40:19,425
is the practical part.

942
00:40:19,426 --> 00:40:22,094
I'm... also hoping the two of you

943
00:40:22,095 --> 00:40:24,629
can keep a friendly eye on her.

944
00:40:26,899 --> 00:40:29,001
- Of course.
- Sure.

945
00:40:29,002 --> 00:40:31,302
Thank you. I should go.

946
00:40:33,505 --> 00:40:36,008
Anton, what's going on?

947
00:40:36,009 --> 00:40:38,043
Are you sick?

948
00:40:38,044 --> 00:40:40,312
No. I am well.

949
00:40:40,313 --> 00:40:42,179
Then what is this about?

950
00:40:43,915 --> 00:40:46,151
In one hour, the Kremlin will announce

951
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:48,553
that President Ostrov is dead.

952
00:40:48,554 --> 00:40:50,821
Wow.

953
00:40:52,290 --> 00:40:55,360
Are you making a play for power?

954
00:40:55,361 --> 00:40:56,828
Because...

955
00:40:56,829 --> 00:40:59,496
between us, you're who I'm hoping for.

956
00:41:00,398 --> 00:41:02,601
I must go back to Moscow.

957
00:41:02,602 --> 00:41:04,703
I have your word on Olga?

958
00:41:04,704 --> 00:41:07,471
- Yes.
- Sure.

959
00:41:13,578 --> 00:41:14,846
Good night.

960
00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:16,914
Thank you.

961
00:41:19,017 --> 00:41:23,154
(whispering): Do you think that he could
have had something to do with it?

962
00:41:23,155 --> 00:41:27,095
Being out of the country when it
happened makes for pretty good cover.

963
00:41:27,992 --> 00:41:30,227
I better call my boss.

964
00:41:34,632 --> 00:41:37,167
What do you want now?

965
00:41:43,207 --> 00:41:45,642
Ostrov is dead.

966
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:54,518
Why should I believe you?

967
00:42:00,224 --> 00:42:03,393
Russia has been through worse.

968
00:42:05,563 --> 00:42:07,465
Take the deal, Dmitri.

969
00:42:07,466 --> 00:42:09,366
Work with me.

970
00:42:10,801 --> 00:42:12,970
I already told you...

971
00:42:12,971 --> 00:42:15,206
I am not a traitor.

972
00:42:15,207 --> 00:42:16,540
I love my country.

973
00:42:16,541 --> 00:42:18,976
Your country is about
to go off the rails.

974
00:42:18,977 --> 00:42:20,478
- No, you don't know this.
- I know

975
00:42:20,479 --> 00:42:22,246
for a fact that top-level
Russian government officials

976
00:42:22,247 --> 00:42:24,907
are securing their families
in foreign cities.

977
00:42:25,149 --> 00:42:26,584
If the power brokers are worried

978
00:42:26,585 --> 00:42:30,653
about<i> their</i> loved ones, what
hope is there for your sister?

979
00:42:40,397 --> 00:42:42,032
You swear she will get these drugs?

980
00:42:42,033 --> 00:42:44,693
She could be on a plane
to Stockholm tomorrow.

981
00:42:57,848 --> 00:43:01,418
I am entrusting you with
my sister's life, Professor.

982
00:43:01,419 --> 00:43:03,386
And my life.

983
00:43:11,862 --> 00:43:14,163
Then we have an agreement?

984
00:43:14,898 --> 00:43:17,139
Yes.

985
