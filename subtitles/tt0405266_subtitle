00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:31,000
වැහිකබාය

4
00:00:38,437 --> 00:00:40,194
These pills are for the morning.

5
00:00:40,263 --> 00:00:42,119
These are for the night.

6
00:00:42,183 --> 00:00:44,041
Don't forget, Mom.

7
00:00:44,362 --> 00:00:46,436
So many packets?

8
00:00:47,084 --> 00:00:49,158
How long will you be
away in calcutta?

9
00:00:49,871 --> 00:00:51,912
There's so much money involved.

10
00:00:51,984 --> 00:00:54,222
There's no guarantee
I'll get it at once.

11
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:58,065
Don't worry, I won't
be away for long.

12
00:00:59,413 --> 00:01:00,692
I'll wait till Tuesday

13
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:04,308
If things work out,
fine... if not...

14
00:01:04,378 --> 00:01:06,386
don't say that... it'll be fine.

15
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,233
Wouldn't it have been better if
you had called alok beforehand?

16
00:01:11,903 --> 00:01:15,202
These things can't be
said on the Phone.

17
00:01:15,267 --> 00:01:17,276
You'll stay with them as well.

18
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:20,228
Couldn't even cook
something for them.

19
00:01:21,512 --> 00:01:23,422
I'm off, Mom.

20
00:01:24,715 --> 00:01:27,684
Will you go there too?

21
00:01:30,351 --> 00:01:32,175
Why did you touch my wallet?

22
00:01:33,041 --> 00:01:36,973
I was putting some holy flowers
there,

23
00:01:37,845 --> 00:01:40,017
From now on, don't touch my wallet!

24
00:01:42,008 --> 00:01:43,154
Don't go there.

25
00:01:43,225 --> 00:01:45,202
Don't beg.

26
00:01:47,452 --> 00:01:50,008
I still have some jewellery left.

27
00:02:29,663 --> 00:02:35,832
What struck you suddenly
this morning?

28
00:02:36,708 --> 00:02:40,420
What struck you
suddenly this morning?

29
00:02:40,488 --> 00:02:46,635
Why turn to your village,
Mathura's king?

30
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:54,993
Mathura's ruler, why go away?

31
00:02:55,059 --> 00:02:59,318
Your fine garments leaving

32
00:02:59,382 --> 00:03:04,602
The golden crown lowering

33
00:03:04,668 --> 00:03:10,455
On the ground the scepter flinging

34
00:03:10,528 --> 00:03:17,309
Why pick up the flute to play?

35
00:03:17,734 --> 00:03:25,257
Mathura's ruler, why go away?

36
00:03:25,324 --> 00:03:32,553
Mathura's ruler, why go away?

37
00:03:32,626 --> 00:03:38,860
Mathura's ruler, why go away?

38
00:03:39,991 --> 00:03:45,495
What magic flew from the skies!

39
00:03:47,421 --> 00:03:55,130
So the royal robe all dusty lies

40
00:03:56,964 --> 00:04:00,263
What magic flew from the skies!

41
00:04:00,328 --> 00:04:05,864
And your heart in longing sighs

42
00:04:05,932 --> 00:04:12,746
Why throw royal laws away?

43
00:04:15,636 --> 00:04:21,391
Why throw royal laws away?

44
00:04:21,465 --> 00:04:27,000
Mathura's ruler, why go away?

45
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:34,109
Mathura's ruler, why go away?

46
00:04:39,494 --> 00:04:47,499
Another's wife, your
old love sits at home

47
00:04:48,975 --> 00:04:57,099
Household chores are hers alone

48
00:04:59,767 --> 00:05:04,593
another's wife, your
old love sits at home

49
00:05:05,371 --> 00:05:10,559
Household chores are hers alone

50
00:05:13,122 --> 00:05:24,904
Tears wiped dry while you moan

51
00:05:24,971 --> 00:05:30,673
Why fill her with fresh dismay?

52
00:05:31,311 --> 00:05:38,673
Krishna, don't go away!

53
00:05:39,062 --> 00:05:46,357
Krishna, don't go away!

54
00:05:46,461 --> 00:05:56,605
Krishna, don't go away!

55
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:08,003
Remember Manoj Tripathi,
our dear Mannu?

56
00:06:08,782 --> 00:06:10,694
He was in hostel with us.

57
00:06:10,769 --> 00:06:12,875
Remember, he was my roommate.

58
00:06:12,946 --> 00:06:17,040
Family pressures made him complete
his finals from the village school.

59
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:20,406
However, as long as
and pa were there,

60
00:06:20,471 --> 00:06:21,455
I used to go to the village.

61
00:06:21,529 --> 00:06:23,439
Hence, Manoj and I stayed in touch.

62
00:06:23,835 --> 00:06:25,298
Now, Manoj has a small problem.

63
00:06:25,372 --> 00:06:27,992
The jute mill where he
worked has closed down.

64
00:06:28,062 --> 00:06:29,852
Now he is completely unemployed.

65
00:06:32,674 --> 00:06:35,293
He's thinking of starting
a business.

66
00:06:35,555 --> 00:06:39,333
He needs around rs. 35
- 40 thousand.

67
00:06:39,463 --> 00:06:41,537
If we can help out

68
00:06:41,608 --> 00:06:43,944
with rs.5 to 7 thousand each,

69
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:49,963
I can't ask this of everyone.

70
00:06:50,032 --> 00:06:54,193
You, I know, will take me seriously.

71
00:06:54,772 --> 00:06:57,971
Hope you'll be able to help.

72
00:06:58,359 --> 00:07:00,215
Thanks.

73
00:07:00,696 --> 00:07:02,455
Is that okay?

74
00:07:10,849 --> 00:07:12,759
What do I write then, tell me?

75
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:18,781
Forget it.

76
00:07:19,495 --> 00:07:21,986
Forget it? What do you mean?

77
00:07:22,057 --> 00:07:23,269
What's your problem?

78
00:07:24,298 --> 00:07:26,472
Last night, it was all decided.

79
00:07:31,441 --> 00:07:34,411
I couldn't sleep all night.

80
00:07:35,284 --> 00:07:37,293
First night in a new place.

81
00:07:37,366 --> 00:07:39,222
Sleep well tonight.

82
00:07:46,589 --> 00:07:48,762
This is nothing but begging.

83
00:07:49,215 --> 00:07:51,126
Begging?

84
00:07:51,201 --> 00:07:55,612
They're all friends!
Your classmates!

85
00:07:58,055 --> 00:08:01,702
Alok, friends don't
need certificates.

86
00:08:01,769 --> 00:08:02,915
Don't be stupid.

87
00:08:02,986 --> 00:08:05,224
It's been 17 long years, since
they've last met you.

88
00:08:05,548 --> 00:08:08,550
They even don't remember
what you look like.

89
00:08:09,584 --> 00:08:11,559
You can't even remember them...

90
00:08:11,632 --> 00:08:13,489
I describe them and you vaguely say,

91
00:08:13,554 --> 00:08:15,563
Yes, yes I know. But,
actually you don't.

92
00:08:17,077 --> 00:08:20,046
There's a difference in
my not recognising them

93
00:08:20,119 --> 00:08:21,233
and them not recognising me.

94
00:08:22,074 --> 00:08:23,985
They're not asking me for money.

95
00:08:24,059 --> 00:08:27,258
Then live with your false Prestige.

96
00:08:27,327 --> 00:08:29,237
Why did you make me
write this letter?

97
00:08:29,567 --> 00:08:31,674
Phone calls for nothing!

98
00:08:31,745 --> 00:08:33,819
Sorry, don't be angry.

99
00:08:34,565 --> 00:08:37,348
I'm just not sure that
they'll trust me.

100
00:08:38,408 --> 00:08:40,481
Hey, look here,

101
00:08:40,648 --> 00:08:43,269
have I changed a lot?

102
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:44,801
They'll recognise me, won't they?

103
00:08:44,876 --> 00:08:46,252
Use that smelly hair oil of your's

104
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:47,844
They'll recognise you
with their eyes shut.

105
00:08:47,917 --> 00:08:50,254
Come. Breakfast's ready.

106
00:08:50,641 --> 00:08:52,551
Hurry up with your shower.

107
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:56,720
There'll be heavy rains
today. It's on TV.

108
00:08:56,789 --> 00:08:57,805
Hurry up, you two.

109
00:08:57,878 --> 00:08:58,893
You go ahead, I'm coming.

110
00:08:58,967 --> 00:09:00,179
Come on.

111
00:09:01,401 --> 00:09:03,061
Govind

112
00:09:03,131 --> 00:09:05,467
Govind! - Yes, I'll
call you in half an hour.

113
00:09:09,856 --> 00:09:12,859
Can't he work in your TV serials?

114
00:09:12,931 --> 00:09:14,208
Who? Manoj?

115
00:09:14,275 --> 00:09:17,147
Yes. Looks Pretty cool and composed.

116
00:09:17,222 --> 00:09:19,712
Can't you give him a job in
one of your Productions?

117
00:09:20,424 --> 00:09:22,761
Who says you need to be
cool and composed...

118
00:09:22,826 --> 00:09:23,940
...to work in production?

119
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:26,504
I meant cool-headed.

120
00:09:27,151 --> 00:09:29,061
After all he's honest,

121
00:09:30,993 --> 00:09:32,904
He won't be able to
do production work.

122
00:09:32,978 --> 00:09:33,994
Why?

123
00:09:34,068 --> 00:09:36,884
You just said
- 'cool and composed'!

124
00:09:37,815 --> 00:09:39,092
Remember, when he went for his bath?

125
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:41,878
Right. Shall I check?

126
00:09:41,946 --> 00:09:43,736
I'll say you're waiting.

127
00:09:43,802 --> 00:09:45,495
No use.

128
00:09:45,564 --> 00:09:47,421
He'll say ' Two minutes'...

129
00:09:47,487 --> 00:09:49,756
and come out 15 minutes later.

130
00:09:50,209 --> 00:09:52,064
As if you know everything!

131
00:09:52,129 --> 00:09:55,581
Of course. We shared a hostel
room

132
00:09:55,973 --> 00:09:57,349
does he eat chicken?

133
00:09:57,414 --> 00:09:58,976
I'll send Govind to the market.

134
00:09:59,048 --> 00:10:00,871
Yes, he does.

135
00:10:02,699 --> 00:10:04,740
I feel so bad for the gentleman.

136
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:07,433
Looks so depressed since he came.

137
00:10:07,599 --> 00:10:09,837
'Gentleman'!!

138
00:10:09,904 --> 00:10:11,596
You're still so formal with him?

139
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:13,674
Haven't you got to first names yet?

140
00:10:13,843 --> 00:10:15,503
I tried.

141
00:10:16,469 --> 00:10:18,478
He prefers Ma'm.

142
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:22,810
I'll go and check

143
00:10:27,935 --> 00:10:29,846
Hello!

144
00:10:31,522 --> 00:10:33,433
Will you take long?

145
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:37,309
Two minutes Ma'm.

146
00:11:00,281 --> 00:11:01,492
Good morning.

147
00:11:01,562 --> 00:11:03,090
Good morning.

148
00:11:06,046 --> 00:11:09,343
What's this? Haven't even
shaved properly?

149
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:14,237
It was dark in the bathroom.

150
00:11:14,693 --> 00:11:16,734
Should've switched the light on.

151
00:11:16,806 --> 00:11:19,907
Did you put the geyser on?
Or, had a cold bath?

152
00:11:19,976 --> 00:11:21,985
I normally bathe in cold water.

153
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:25,511
My mistake. Should've put
the geyser on for you.

154
00:11:25,678 --> 00:11:27,589
Here, start.

155
00:11:28,142 --> 00:11:30,054
Sorry!

156
00:11:31,346 --> 00:11:34,251
There's baked beans, butter, cheese.

157
00:11:34,804 --> 00:11:39,150
Ignore him. He's dieting. Has
Herbalife for breakfast.

158
00:11:42,491 --> 00:11:45,875
You said you don't have
to wear a tie to work?

159
00:11:46,429 --> 00:11:48,186
There's a meeting at
National TV today

160
00:11:48,254 --> 00:11:49,303
They're selling slots.

161
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:50,424
Slot?

162
00:11:50,497 --> 00:11:53,183
Time slots. Like say, 7-8

163
00:11:54,981 --> 00:11:59,392
Oh, I thought slot machine.
As in casinos.

164
00:12:00,106 --> 00:12:03,074
Ya, TV serials are as good
as gambling these days.

165
00:12:03,147 --> 00:12:07,592
Earlier, they were like
fixed deposits.

166
00:12:07,663 --> 00:12:09,704
Now it's all about cost-cuts.

167
00:12:10,353 --> 00:12:11,401
Have you taken the letter?

168
00:12:11,474 --> 00:12:12,489
Yes.

169
00:12:12,562 --> 00:12:13,643
The list of names?

170
00:12:13,716 --> 00:12:15,572
In the room, with the letter.

171
00:12:16,118 --> 00:12:18,028
Let me see it once.

172
00:12:18,103 --> 00:12:20,374
You sit. I'll get it.

173
00:12:20,921 --> 00:12:22,832
It's on the table, under my wallet.

174
00:12:23,099 --> 00:12:24,856
Let's plan...

175
00:12:25,725 --> 00:12:29,503
Today South. Then central and North.

176
00:12:30,464 --> 00:12:31,513
Meaning?

177
00:12:31,586 --> 00:12:34,435
You can't cover 12 offices in a day.

178
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,516
Today finish the south.

179
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:37,445
Do the central tomorrow
The day after, north.

180
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:38,559
Your wallet.

181
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:40,160
You left it lying around?

182
00:12:41,032 --> 00:12:42,244
There's not much money in it.

183
00:12:42,315 --> 00:12:44,323
There must be other things,
it's so bulky.

184
00:12:46,798 --> 00:12:48,708
Actually...

185
00:12:48,816 --> 00:12:50,891
It's full of these. (tobacco
powder sachets)

186
00:13:04,092 --> 00:13:06,516
Where will this address
be? North or South?

187
00:13:09,151 --> 00:13:11,128
Lake Market. South.

188
00:13:11,778 --> 00:13:13,152
Whose address is it?

189
00:13:13,219 --> 00:13:15,556
Will it be near the
area I'm going today?

190
00:13:15,621 --> 00:13:17,793
Yes it will. But whose
address is it?

191
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,516
You know the person.

192
00:13:20,585 --> 00:13:22,594
Ya, that way I know every one.

193
00:13:23,308 --> 00:13:25,218
Tell me, where is it?

194
00:13:26,189 --> 00:13:29,093
Is it business or just
a social visit?

195
00:13:31,987 --> 00:13:34,323
I can't talk business here, alok.

196
00:13:34,773 --> 00:13:36,628
If I could...

197
00:13:36,694 --> 00:13:39,249
...then I wouldn't have
to go to so many people.

198
00:13:41,594 --> 00:13:43,505
Relative?

199
00:13:45,341 --> 00:13:47,252
Someone I know?

200
00:13:53,988 --> 00:13:55,844
Why get so livid, alok?

201
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:56,958
A childhood acquaintance...

202
00:13:57,031 --> 00:13:58,078
He wants to visit her.

203
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:59,680
Give him the directions. Finished

204
00:13:59,754 --> 00:14:00,964
Finished.

205
00:14:01,033 --> 00:14:03,906
She kicked him in the ass and
set up home with someone else!

206
00:14:03,981 --> 00:14:04,995
Alok!

207
00:14:05,069 --> 00:14:06,413
Come on, why should he go there?

208
00:14:06,478 --> 00:14:07,559
Why not?

209
00:14:07,631 --> 00:14:08,711
It's up to him!

210
00:14:08,783 --> 00:14:09,799
Up to him!

211
00:14:09,873 --> 00:14:11,850
What about the time we spent on him?

212
00:14:11,923 --> 00:14:13,833
Took him to all the films in town.

213
00:14:14,164 --> 00:14:16,501
Saw a film six times!

214
00:14:16,567 --> 00:14:19,383
Why? Just to make
him forget that...

215
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:22,101
...that girl!

216
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:24,027
It's not all that easy, alok.

217
00:14:24,092 --> 00:14:25,555
Then people wouldn't
psychiatrists,

218
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:27,486
they'd go to cinema halls.

219
00:14:27,552 --> 00:14:29,560
Do you think that...

220
00:14:29,633 --> 00:14:32,286
everyone who watches your soaps

221
00:14:32,355 --> 00:14:34,211
don't have any problems?

222
00:14:34,276 --> 00:14:36,133
They just forget everything?

223
00:14:38,216 --> 00:14:40,455
Look, if you go there,

224
00:14:40,522 --> 00:14:43,043
get at least 15 thousand.

225
00:14:43,115 --> 00:14:44,131
Shame on you!

226
00:14:44,205 --> 00:14:45,252
Why?

227
00:14:45,324 --> 00:14:46,755
What about her Mom?

228
00:14:46,831 --> 00:14:48,937
She got carried away with
his job, money and house.

229
00:14:49,008 --> 00:14:50,537
Got her married off to that guy.

230
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:53,677
He was jobless then
- no income.

231
00:14:53,747 --> 00:14:55,408
Ya, I agree.

232
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:58,229
But in a crisis like this...

233
00:14:58,295 --> 00:15:01,265
Won't your childhood sweetheart
bail you out?

234
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:09,174
Don't know.

235
00:15:10,081 --> 00:15:16,229
But will you like it if
I go begging there?

236
00:15:18,472 --> 00:15:20,329
It's raining.

237
00:15:20,394 --> 00:15:22,249
Can I give you an umbrella?

238
00:15:23,212 --> 00:15:24,489
No, I'll lose it.

239
00:15:24,557 --> 00:15:26,413
I have to go to so many places.

240
00:15:26,478 --> 00:15:27,495
I'll definitely leave it behind.

241
00:15:27,568 --> 00:15:29,062
But you'll get drenched.

242
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:30,894
Didn't I have a raincoat?

243
00:15:30,962 --> 00:15:32,752
Give it to him.

244
00:15:32,818 --> 00:15:35,309
Yes, but Govind uses that now.

245
00:15:35,382 --> 00:15:36,659
Who is Govind?

246
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:38,582
Our domestic help.

247
00:15:39,545 --> 00:15:40,593
That's not a problem

248
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:42,096
I really don't need it.

249
00:15:42,427 --> 00:15:44,436
If you don't have any problem

250
00:15:44,509 --> 00:15:46,266
he's basically very clean.

251
00:15:46,334 --> 00:15:48,606
I'm telling you, give it to him.

252
00:15:48,673 --> 00:15:50,681
Why explain?

253
00:15:51,074 --> 00:15:52,985
Ok.

254
00:15:54,212 --> 00:15:56,123
Govind.

255
00:15:57,894 --> 00:15:59,206
I'll just go once...

256
00:15:59,273 --> 00:16:01,183
I'll see her and leave...

257
00:16:01,258 --> 00:16:03,016
Two minutes, I promise.

258
00:16:05,485 --> 00:16:07,396
Are you still in touch?

259
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:13,105
Why are you going, Manoj?

260
00:16:13,171 --> 00:16:14,547
You'll get upset again.

261
00:16:14,613 --> 00:16:16,557
I won't, trust me.

262
00:16:17,014 --> 00:16:18,871
I remember everything.

263
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:21,425
You guys saw a movie
6 times just for me.

264
00:16:22,074 --> 00:16:24,182
Am I that irresponsible?

265
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:28,790
Just show the address once.

266
00:16:29,856 --> 00:16:31,615
Here's your raincoat

267
00:16:31,683 --> 00:16:33,539
I've put perfume on it.

268
00:16:33,604 --> 00:16:35,843
Who do I thank? You or Govind?

269
00:16:37,126 --> 00:16:40,261
Look, there's a phone number
beside every name.

270
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:42,982
On top, my office number...

271
00:16:43,051 --> 00:16:45,125
our home phone and mobile numbers.

272
00:16:45,197 --> 00:16:47,141
Call me on the mobile
if you need to.

273
00:16:47,215 --> 00:16:49,070
Shall I give him my mobile?

274
00:16:49,136 --> 00:16:50,894
Coz, I'm at home.

275
00:16:50,962 --> 00:16:51,978
Ok

276
00:16:52,051 --> 00:16:53,775
No Ma'm, no need for a mobile.

277
00:16:53,844 --> 00:16:56,749
If needed, I'll call from a booth

278
00:16:56,823 --> 00:16:58,679
Where will you look for a
phone booth in this rain?

279
00:16:58,744 --> 00:17:00,437
Take this,

280
00:17:00,506 --> 00:17:02,361
can you use a mobile?

281
00:17:03,067 --> 00:17:04,278
I've never used one.

282
00:17:04,349 --> 00:17:05,396
Show him.

283
00:17:05,469 --> 00:17:07,162
All the best
- Thanks

284
00:17:07,872 --> 00:17:09,880
It's very simple.

285
00:17:20,555 --> 00:17:22,148
Thank you

286
00:17:24,397 --> 00:17:28,394
can I say something
if you don't mind?

287
00:17:30,001 --> 00:17:31,912
Of course

288
00:17:32,788 --> 00:17:34,796
You're meeting her for the first
time after her marriage...

289
00:17:35,671 --> 00:17:38,639
Won't you take something?

290
00:17:41,754 --> 00:17:44,724
Look for a gift in this rain?

291
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:49,536
And honestly, I don't
have any money.

292
00:17:51,362 --> 00:17:54,234
I have many new gifts...

293
00:17:54,308 --> 00:17:57,311
...which I haven't even opened.

294
00:17:59,048 --> 00:18:00,576
Now, can I ask you something?

295
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:02,691
What?

296
00:18:02,763 --> 00:18:05,384
Why do girls cry so much

297
00:18:05,454 --> 00:18:07,693
when they leave home after marriage?

298
00:18:08,336 --> 00:18:10,193
Just because they're leaving
their parents?

299
00:18:10,354 --> 00:18:13,771
Why? Did she cry a lot?

300
00:18:14,997 --> 00:18:16,144
I don't know,

301
00:18:16,215 --> 00:18:17,808
I wasn't there.

302
00:18:19,161 --> 00:18:21,072
Then?

303
00:18:21,722 --> 00:18:24,540
I still remember you wept
all the way in the car...

304
00:18:24,606 --> 00:18:27,574
...on the way back
after your wedding.

305
00:18:31,587 --> 00:18:33,498
Right?

306
00:18:37,096 --> 00:18:39,104
Next time you cry in the bathroom,

307
00:18:39,177 --> 00:18:41,186
please turn the shower on.

308
00:18:44,077 --> 00:18:45,671
You need to learn a few things

309
00:18:45,742 --> 00:18:46,822
from us girls too.

310
00:18:48,817 --> 00:18:55,345
Mathura's ruler, why go away?

311
00:18:58,232 --> 00:19:04,500
Mathura's ruler, why go away?

312
00:19:07,392 --> 00:19:12,578
Your lovely wives have worried eyes

313
00:19:14,692 --> 00:19:24,674
Flowers seem thorns where he lies,

314
00:19:28,016 --> 00:19:31,793
Your lovely wives have worried eyes

315
00:19:31,859 --> 00:19:36,019
all night Krishna sleepless sighs

316
00:19:36,086 --> 00:19:44,025
Why call the chariot, wait till day

317
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:51,964
Mathura's ruler, don't go away

318
00:19:52,035 --> 00:19:59,809
Mathura's ruler, why go away?

319
00:20:03,757 --> 00:20:08,878
Slowly slowly nearing the river

320
00:20:10,738 --> 00:20:21,429
Lonely waters where breezes quiver

321
00:20:23,772 --> 00:20:27,071
Slowly slowly nearing the river

322
00:20:27,136 --> 00:20:31,874
From time to time grief forever

323
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:38,174
Shakes him, ruler don't be swayed!

324
00:20:38,247 --> 00:20:45,708
Mathura's ruler, don't go away

325
00:20:45,774 --> 00:20:53,713
Mathura's ruler, why go away?

326
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:26,372
O-o-u-c-h! Oh God!

327
00:21:26,447 --> 00:21:27,910
What's wrong?

328
00:21:30,161 --> 00:21:31,919
Isn't anyone home?

329
00:21:32,789 --> 00:21:34,251
Are you hurt?

330
00:21:35,926 --> 00:21:38,863
My back... can't get up.

331
00:21:42,395 --> 00:21:44,732
Wait, don't try. I'm coming.

332
00:21:55,078 --> 00:21:56,738
Hey!

333
00:21:56,808 --> 00:21:58,183
What are you doing there?

334
00:21:58,248 --> 00:22:00,323
Get down. Right away

335
00:22:01,612 --> 00:22:03,523
Get down, or I'll call the police!

336
00:22:03,596 --> 00:22:04,612
Who is it?

337
00:22:09,426 --> 00:22:11,085
Manoj.

338
00:22:11,411 --> 00:22:13,006
Who Manoj?

339
00:22:16,151 --> 00:22:20,311
Manoj. Mannu from Bhagalpur

340
00:22:22,044 --> 00:22:25,045
rubbish! Tell me your real name?

341
00:22:25,118 --> 00:22:27,608
No Niru, it's really me, Mannu.

342
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,656
Can't you recognise my voice?

343
00:22:32,548 --> 00:22:35,268
Don't get wet, stand
under the shade.

344
00:22:35,494 --> 00:22:37,187
I'm coming.

345
00:22:52,469 --> 00:22:54,324
Come in

346
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:56,301
What's wrong?

347
00:22:56,376 --> 00:22:58,319
Nothing. Why?

348
00:22:58,393 --> 00:22:59,441
You took so long.

349
00:22:59,513 --> 00:23:00,660
Did you fall or anything?

350
00:23:00,731 --> 00:23:03,220
No, I had fallen asleep.

351
00:23:03,293 --> 00:23:05,467
Suddenly I heard your bell.

352
00:23:06,815 --> 00:23:08,093
Come inside.

353
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:15,455
So many years have passed
since you came this way

354
00:23:16,744 --> 00:23:18,599
I won't stay long.

355
00:23:18,665 --> 00:23:21,155
Sit for a while. Let the rain stop.

356
00:23:21,227 --> 00:23:22,754
Shall I make some tea?

357
00:23:22,827 --> 00:23:24,356
Do you have to make it?

358
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,281
Not much choice.

359
00:23:26,351 --> 00:23:30,064
My servants always vanish
in the afternoon!

360
00:23:30,131 --> 00:23:31,789
Won't you take that raincoat off?

361
00:23:39,482 --> 00:23:40,693
Vanish? Where?

362
00:23:40,763 --> 00:23:42,291
No idea.

363
00:23:42,363 --> 00:23:44,602
After lunch I feel sleepy.

364
00:23:44,669 --> 00:23:47,159
I tell them to stay around,

365
00:23:47,232 --> 00:23:48,248
there may be some urgent letter,

366
00:23:48,321 --> 00:23:49,336
some courier.

367
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:51,004
They hardly listen.

368
00:23:51,075 --> 00:23:52,287
Even bought them a TV...

369
00:23:52,356 --> 00:23:54,529
still they sneak out to play cards!

370
00:23:58,697 --> 00:24:01,929
I woke you up at the wrong time.

371
00:24:03,629 --> 00:24:05,290
Sorry!

372
00:24:05,359 --> 00:24:06,635
What do you mean?

373
00:24:06,704 --> 00:24:08,745
I would have got up anyway.

374
00:24:10,355 --> 00:24:12,331
Were you ringing the
bell for a long time?

375
00:24:13,045 --> 00:24:15,086
Not really.

376
00:24:15,159 --> 00:24:16,982
Won't you open the windows?

377
00:24:17,048 --> 00:24:19,318
The rain will come in.

378
00:24:23,613 --> 00:24:25,524
put a light on at least...

379
00:24:26,688 --> 00:24:29,058
can't even see you properly.

380
00:24:32,581 --> 00:24:36,675
And what kind of a furniture
- godown have you made here?

381
00:24:38,025 --> 00:24:40,033
No room to move!

382
00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:41,798
That's the problem of being married

383
00:24:41,868 --> 00:24:43,330
to an aristocratic family.

384
00:24:43,789 --> 00:24:45,799
You won't understand.

385
00:24:46,671 --> 00:24:48,680
plenty of old furniture

386
00:24:49,554 --> 00:24:51,727
all apparently antique.

387
00:24:51,796 --> 00:24:53,707
Not a single piece
can be thrown out.

388
00:24:59,097 --> 00:25:00,955
Its stuffy.

389
00:25:01,116 --> 00:25:02,873
Why is your hair falling
over your face?

390
00:25:02,941 --> 00:25:03,989
push it back!

391
00:25:05,119 --> 00:25:07,673
You've changed a lot, Mannu.

392
00:25:08,706 --> 00:25:09,917
Me?

393
00:25:09,986 --> 00:25:12,858
Lost weight...

394
00:25:12,933 --> 00:25:14,560
Become dark...

395
00:25:14,629 --> 00:25:16,486
sunken cheeks...

396
00:25:16,551 --> 00:25:17,665
thin hair...

397
00:25:18,473 --> 00:25:20,165
Take the shirt off?

398
00:25:20,235 --> 00:25:22,092
No, why?

399
00:25:23,117 --> 00:25:24,166
It's soaked.

400
00:25:24,238 --> 00:25:25,285
You'll catch cold.

401
00:25:25,358 --> 00:25:26,407
It's okay

402
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,527
Take it off,

403
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,512
I'll hang it in the
next room, it'll dry.

404
00:25:31,764 --> 00:25:33,675
Switch on a light, please.

405
00:25:46,176 --> 00:25:47,256
Niru, just 20 minutes left.

406
00:25:47,328 --> 00:25:48,409
It's getting late.

407
00:25:48,481 --> 00:25:50,588
Wait. I'm getting ready.

408
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:54,277
Then you get ready.

409
00:25:54,343 --> 00:25:55,969
I'll go and call a rickshaw.

410
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,951
I'm almost done.

411
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:03,844
Think it over, Niru.
There's still time.

412
00:26:04,366 --> 00:26:05,577
What?

413
00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:10,386
This film is only for adults.

414
00:26:12,308 --> 00:26:14,220
So?

415
00:26:14,934 --> 00:26:18,135
Girls are adults at 18,

416
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:20,308
don't you know?

417
00:26:21,852 --> 00:26:22,867
There are so many films in town.

418
00:26:22,941 --> 00:26:24,536
Must you see this one?

419
00:26:24,607 --> 00:26:26,397
Yes I must.

420
00:26:26,465 --> 00:26:28,953
If you have any problem, tell me.

421
00:26:29,025 --> 00:26:30,621
I'll go with someone else.

422
00:26:31,588 --> 00:26:33,117
I don't care.

423
00:26:33,189 --> 00:26:35,361
Neighbours will see you...

424
00:26:37,033 --> 00:26:38,888
come inside, please

425
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:40,356
Why?

426
00:26:40,427 --> 00:26:42,338
Oh, just come!

427
00:26:49,715 --> 00:26:51,374
I can't do this button.

428
00:26:51,444 --> 00:26:52,655
please fix it for me.

429
00:27:02,205 --> 00:27:04,508
I can't do it. Wear something else.

430
00:27:08,994 --> 00:27:10,522
Who are you scared of,

431
00:27:10,595 --> 00:27:13,598
sitting and watching an
adult movie with me?

432
00:27:14,438 --> 00:27:16,294
Neighbours?

433
00:27:16,359 --> 00:27:17,888
Or yourself?

434
00:27:19,658 --> 00:27:21,253
I'd like a glass of water, Niru.

435
00:27:21,324 --> 00:27:24,555
Wait. Let me put the light on first.

436
00:27:25,968 --> 00:27:28,304
I'll switch it on.
The switch is here.

437
00:27:29,811 --> 00:27:31,087
There's a power cut, Mannu.

438
00:27:31,155 --> 00:27:33,099
I have to turn the generator on.

439
00:27:34,615 --> 00:27:36,022
Shall I come, or can you manage?

440
00:27:36,087 --> 00:27:37,999
No... no... you sit.

441
00:27:38,074 --> 00:27:40,891
Don't know where they've
kept the kerosene...

442
00:27:40,956 --> 00:27:44,537
actually they handle all this

443
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,341
But the bell rang.

444
00:27:50,243 --> 00:27:54,273
Oh, that was another power-line.

445
00:27:54,343 --> 00:27:56,581
You're right, it's not a power cut.

446
00:27:56,647 --> 00:27:57,859
A power-line has gone.

447
00:27:58,762 --> 00:28:01,131
Maybe, it's the rain.

448
00:28:04,334 --> 00:28:06,245
Then what are you doing?

449
00:28:09,395 --> 00:28:11,151
Thank goodness the bell rang.

450
00:28:11,219 --> 00:28:13,076
Why?

451
00:28:13,141 --> 00:28:14,834
Otherwise you would be knocking

452
00:28:14,903 --> 00:28:16,277
and I would be sleeping.

453
00:28:16,344 --> 00:28:17,775
Wouldn't have heard you at all.

454
00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:19,639
Where do I put this?

455
00:28:19,706 --> 00:28:21,082
put it here.

456
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:24,765
Then I have to sit here,

457
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:27,647
otherwise you can't see me.

458
00:28:28,546 --> 00:28:33,405
You sit there. Leave the candle
here. The shirt will dry slowly.

459
00:28:52,372 --> 00:28:54,229
See,

460
00:28:54,295 --> 00:28:56,205
no bruises...

461
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:58,070
no black eye...

462
00:28:58,138 --> 00:29:00,179
he hasn't burnt me with acid...

463
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:04,218
My husband really loves me, Mannu

464
00:29:04,286 --> 00:29:07,671
So many years have passed

465
00:29:07,744 --> 00:29:10,300
since you came this way

466
00:29:15,431 --> 00:29:17,342
Were you going out?

467
00:29:17,417 --> 00:29:19,274
No.

468
00:29:20,331 --> 00:29:22,243
Expecting guests?

469
00:29:22,316 --> 00:29:24,326
No
- why?

470
00:29:24,398 --> 00:29:27,532
So dressed up?

471
00:29:27,601 --> 00:29:29,064
What dressed up?

472
00:29:29,138 --> 00:29:30,797
Usually wear a caftan,

473
00:29:30,868 --> 00:29:33,772
I'm wearing a sari now.

474
00:29:36,665 --> 00:29:39,002
You wear such expensive
saris at home?

475
00:29:39,067 --> 00:29:40,344
Just wore it.

476
00:29:40,411 --> 00:29:42,420
Otherwise they'd rot in the cupboard

477
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:45,144
Tell me,

478
00:29:45,215 --> 00:29:48,993
who likes sitting alone at
home wearing a silk sari?

479
00:29:49,058 --> 00:29:50,204
Why all alone?

480
00:29:50,275 --> 00:29:51,324
What else?

481
00:29:53,157 --> 00:29:54,685
Why?

482
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,768
Where's everyone else?

483
00:29:56,841 --> 00:29:58,697
The servants?

484
00:29:58,763 --> 00:30:00,836
I told you, they go
out in the afternoon.

485
00:30:00,907 --> 00:30:01,923
See, they're still not back

486
00:30:01,997 --> 00:30:03,340
they've been away for so long.

487
00:30:04,623 --> 00:30:06,218
Surely there are other people

488
00:30:06,289 --> 00:30:07,663
in the house besides the servants.

489
00:30:08,402 --> 00:30:10,062
Not at the moment.

490
00:30:13,014 --> 00:30:14,871
What time does he come home?

491
00:30:14,936 --> 00:30:16,792
Say... which day?

492
00:30:18,137 --> 00:30:19,665
What do you mean?

493
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:23,127
Doesn't your husband live here?

494
00:30:23,582 --> 00:30:25,439
When he's in Kolkata yes,

495
00:30:25,504 --> 00:30:27,361
where else would he go?

496
00:30:28,386 --> 00:30:30,243
Where is he now?

497
00:30:30,565 --> 00:30:32,737
Can't say

498
00:30:32,806 --> 00:30:34,083
what time is it?

499
00:30:36,072 --> 00:30:37,120
Two ten.

500
00:30:37,193 --> 00:30:38,242
Two ten.

501
00:30:38,314 --> 00:30:42,091
Four and a half-hours
time difference,

502
00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:45,861
Oh... he was supposed to
go to japan today.

503
00:30:46,898 --> 00:30:47,944
I didn't understand.

504
00:30:48,016 --> 00:30:49,960
Went to Germany first,

505
00:30:50,035 --> 00:30:51,467
said he'd be back from there.

506
00:30:51,541 --> 00:30:53,233
Suddenly a call came
from his office,

507
00:30:53,302 --> 00:30:55,792
that he had to go to japan,
for some urgent meeting.

508
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:59,378
Now he should be on the flight.

509
00:31:00,988 --> 00:31:02,844
'Should'?

510
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:04,758
You don't know for sure?

511
00:31:08,034 --> 00:31:10,141
I can't do it anymore, Mannu.

512
00:31:10,917 --> 00:31:13,090
Earlier I used to keep track,

513
00:31:13,478 --> 00:31:15,716
kept all the news.

514
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:18,730
What do you do with someone

515
00:31:18,795 --> 00:31:21,163
who's such a jetsetter?

516
00:31:21,229 --> 00:31:25,258
Now the office gets the mail

517
00:31:25,328 --> 00:31:27,883
and his secretary keeps me informed.

518
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:30,761
Your husband tours a lot?

519
00:31:31,732 --> 00:31:33,589
Two huge suitcases with wheels,

520
00:31:33,654 --> 00:31:35,990
two sets of clothes, towels,
brushes, shaving stuff,

521
00:31:36,055 --> 00:31:38,776
toilet kit... all in
pairs kept separately.

522
00:31:38,843 --> 00:31:39,857
He arrives with one set,

523
00:31:39,931 --> 00:31:41,361
that goes for dry cleaning,

524
00:31:41,436 --> 00:31:42,485
he takes off with the other set.

525
00:31:42,558 --> 00:31:44,085
By the time he returns,

526
00:31:44,158 --> 00:31:46,332
the first set is back,
washed and ready.

527
00:31:48,962 --> 00:31:50,874
You don't go with him?

528
00:31:50,949 --> 00:31:51,931
Go where?

529
00:31:52,004 --> 00:31:53,053
It's not a holiday.

530
00:31:53,126 --> 00:31:54,818
Today in one place, tomorrow
he's somewhere else,

531
00:31:54,887 --> 00:31:56,776
can't take this spinning around.

532
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:58,817
I'm happy at home.

533
00:31:58,891 --> 00:31:59,939
Moreover

534
00:32:00,012 --> 00:32:02,981
you need someone to
look after the house.

535
00:32:05,295 --> 00:32:06,344
You don't travel...

536
00:32:06,417 --> 00:32:07,727
because you have to guard the house?

537
00:32:10,195 --> 00:32:12,531
You weren't born a girl, Mannu.

538
00:32:14,038 --> 00:32:16,276
Besides I don't like travelling.

539
00:32:16,825 --> 00:32:18,681
And while he's at his meetings,

540
00:32:18,747 --> 00:32:19,795
What would I do

541
00:32:19,866 --> 00:32:20,981
What else?

542
00:32:21,053 --> 00:32:22,909
See places, enjoy, have fun...

543
00:32:22,975 --> 00:32:24,601
What do mean by 'have fun'?

544
00:32:24,671 --> 00:32:25,687
Standing in front of...

545
00:32:25,761 --> 00:32:26,841
those big stores

546
00:32:27,714 --> 00:32:29,242
What do you call that?

547
00:32:30,276 --> 00:32:31,487
Window shopping.

548
00:32:31,557 --> 00:32:33,151
Yes, window shopping.

549
00:32:33,222 --> 00:32:35,591
What else can I do alone, Mannu?

550
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:39,491
Can't even speak fluent English.

551
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,715
Travel once or twice, you'll learn.

552
00:32:49,524 --> 00:32:52,242
He can't be in meetings 24 hours?

553
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:55,312
Your husband should
have some free time.

554
00:32:56,344 --> 00:32:57,360
No,

555
00:32:57,433 --> 00:32:58,961
He keeps insisting...

556
00:32:59,034 --> 00:33:01,852
Earlier he always said,

557
00:33:01,917 --> 00:33:03,773
'come with me'.

558
00:33:03,839 --> 00:33:05,749
Then?

559
00:33:05,824 --> 00:33:07,035
Then what?

560
00:33:07,105 --> 00:33:09,146
In april he went to London.

561
00:33:09,218 --> 00:33:10,497
He said, 'I have work till Friday...

562
00:33:10,564 --> 00:33:11,775
...you reach by then...

563
00:33:11,845 --> 00:33:13,701
...we'll spend the
weekend together'.

564
00:33:14,407 --> 00:33:15,815
And you didn't go

565
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:16,895
No.

566
00:33:16,969 --> 00:33:18,497
Why? Too expensive?

567
00:33:18,570 --> 00:33:21,060
No, no. That's borne by the office.

568
00:33:21,132 --> 00:33:24,133
That's the advantage
in a good company.

569
00:33:24,206 --> 00:33:26,511
Once a year with family.

570
00:33:26,577 --> 00:33:27,953
Then why didn't you go?

571
00:33:28,818 --> 00:33:31,242
God! Such a huge plane...

572
00:33:31,317 --> 00:33:32,976
such a long journey...

573
00:33:35,544 --> 00:33:37,333
people die to go to London

574
00:33:37,401 --> 00:33:38,548
and here you're scared!

575
00:33:39,323 --> 00:33:41,561
Can't tell everyone everything,

576
00:33:41,628 --> 00:33:43,158
I'm telling you.

577
00:33:43,231 --> 00:33:45,206
It's so scary!

578
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:47,421
Such a long journey,

579
00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:49,880
supposing I have to go to
the bathroom on the plane

580
00:33:51,813 --> 00:33:53,221
planes have good bathrooms.

581
00:33:53,287 --> 00:33:54,881
They're not dirty, like in trains.

582
00:33:54,952 --> 00:33:56,066
Haven't you seen them in films?

583
00:33:56,136 --> 00:33:57,894
That's not the problem.

584
00:33:57,962 --> 00:34:00,964
If I can't open the lock and
get stuck in the bathroom,

585
00:34:01,036 --> 00:34:03,275
How will I call for help?

586
00:34:03,343 --> 00:34:05,515
I don't even know that much English!

587
00:34:09,234 --> 00:34:10,960
So, you don't go abroad because

588
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:13,071
you might get stuck in the bathroom

589
00:34:15,833 --> 00:34:17,743
You haven't changed at all, Niru.

590
00:34:17,881 --> 00:34:19,923
Thank god I haven't.

591
00:34:20,093 --> 00:34:22,232
If I had really changed

592
00:34:22,558 --> 00:34:24,796
and refused to recognise you?

593
00:34:27,362 --> 00:34:29,273
For a moment I thought as much.

594
00:34:30,245 --> 00:34:32,286
The way you kept me waiting outside.

595
00:34:32,358 --> 00:34:35,874
Before opening the door,
one has to find out.

596
00:34:35,945 --> 00:34:37,855
So many things happen in calcutta,

597
00:34:37,930 --> 00:34:40,835
murders and robberies in daylight.

598
00:34:40,909 --> 00:34:42,666
You don't know anything.

599
00:34:49,396 --> 00:34:50,607
Shall I open the door?

600
00:34:50,677 --> 00:34:52,205
No.

601
00:34:52,278 --> 00:34:53,326
Why?

602
00:34:53,399 --> 00:34:54,447
Who knows who's there?

603
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:56,048
Can't just open the door like that

604
00:34:57,081 --> 00:34:58,162
But I'm here.

605
00:34:58,234 --> 00:35:00,091
please don't open it, Mannu.

606
00:35:00,924 --> 00:35:02,006
Why?

607
00:35:02,078 --> 00:35:03,737
Don't

608
00:35:04,767 --> 00:35:06,143
What kind of madness is this, Niru?

609
00:35:06,210 --> 00:35:07,738
I said I'm here.

610
00:35:07,811 --> 00:35:09,983
It's because you're here...

611
00:35:11,814 --> 00:35:13,724
I didn't understand.

612
00:35:15,657 --> 00:35:18,212
Otherwise, he's a very good person.

613
00:35:18,314 --> 00:35:21,994
Just has to see me with a man...

614
00:35:22,061 --> 00:35:27,052
...friend, relative, neighbour...

615
00:35:27,827 --> 00:35:30,960
can't even invite anyone in for tea.

616
00:35:32,565 --> 00:35:34,477
I'm not mad, Mannu...

617
00:35:40,445 --> 00:35:43,228
But your husband is in japan

618
00:35:43,294 --> 00:35:44,409
That must be someone else.

619
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,904
That someone will come in,
see me with you...

620
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:48,441
and the news will reach him at once.

621
00:35:48,514 --> 00:35:51,387
That I was alone with you inside.

622
00:35:53,958 --> 00:35:55,750
Nothing will happen.

623
00:35:55,817 --> 00:35:57,027
Someone's soaking
in the rain outside

624
00:35:57,097 --> 00:35:58,440
Okay, go ahead,

625
00:35:59,468 --> 00:36:00,678
open the door.

626
00:36:00,748 --> 00:36:01,797
Let him see everything.

627
00:36:01,870 --> 00:36:03,245
What does it matter to you,

628
00:36:03,311 --> 00:36:06,826
you've come to ruin my
marriage in any case.

629
00:36:08,115 --> 00:36:09,970
Let him beat me, kill me,

630
00:36:10,036 --> 00:36:11,411
lock me up in the bathroom,

631
00:36:13,238 --> 00:36:15,280
you won't be here to save me.

632
00:36:19,643 --> 00:36:21,555
Now what? Go!

633
00:36:43,759 --> 00:36:47,853
I haven't come to
ruin your marriage.

634
00:36:49,843 --> 00:36:51,787
I've just come to see you, Niru.

635
00:36:56,601 --> 00:37:14,980
A dry monsoon overflows with rain

636
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:25,803
after so many years these eyes...

637
00:37:25,873 --> 00:37:35,352
...flood with tears of pain

638
00:37:36,378 --> 00:37:52,004
My love, don't, don't say I am your
life (Hindi film song)

639
00:38:58,042 --> 00:39:00,150
See, not back yet!

640
00:39:03,808 --> 00:39:06,046
And no sign of that driver either.

641
00:39:06,690 --> 00:39:08,546
What's the time now?

642
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:10,779
Quarter to three.

643
00:39:10,852 --> 00:39:12,381
Need to send him somewhere?

644
00:39:12,455 --> 00:39:15,840
No, the rush hour will start soon.

645
00:39:16,298 --> 00:39:18,154
The roads are waterlogged

646
00:39:18,219 --> 00:39:19,430
and you won't be able to
get up on a bus or tram.

647
00:39:19,499 --> 00:39:21,355
He could drop you home.

648
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:24,166
Don't worry about me.

649
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:27,210
I thought you needed him
for something else.

650
00:39:36,730 --> 00:39:40,181
Good you came, Mannu.

651
00:39:41,213 --> 00:39:43,124
Please come more often.

652
00:39:43,199 --> 00:39:45,143
At least we'll meet,

653
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:47,870
get some news from home.

654
00:39:50,917 --> 00:39:53,253
We also don't get any news from you.

655
00:39:53,959 --> 00:39:57,857
Here you are living like
a queen, such luxury.

656
00:39:57,930 --> 00:39:59,874
We don't even get
to know about that.

657
00:40:01,389 --> 00:40:03,246
I can't go round telling the world!

658
00:40:03,311 --> 00:40:05,223
They'll think I'm bragging.

659
00:40:05,297 --> 00:40:09,970
Good you came, saw for yourself.

660
00:40:10,037 --> 00:40:11,948
Why brag?

661
00:40:12,023 --> 00:40:13,812
But you can come occasionally,

662
00:40:13,879 --> 00:40:15,987
you'd like it.

663
00:40:18,043 --> 00:40:20,632
When your husband goes
on a long tour,

664
00:40:20,702 --> 00:40:22,393
come over.

665
00:40:22,462 --> 00:40:24,057
I don't know.

666
00:40:24,641 --> 00:40:27,708
It's been six years.

667
00:40:28,227 --> 00:40:30,137
I'm not used to it now.

668
00:40:30,212 --> 00:40:32,156
Please don't tell Mom

669
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:34,883
there are no attached bathrooms,
no TV, no ac.

670
00:40:34,952 --> 00:40:36,001
How will I stay?

671
00:40:36,074 --> 00:40:37,122
Of course there's a TV!

672
00:40:37,195 --> 00:40:38,886
In every home now.

673
00:40:38,955 --> 00:40:40,004
There's not much difference

674
00:40:40,077 --> 00:40:41,604
between town and village anymore.

675
00:40:42,638 --> 00:40:44,495
You haven't been there for ages,

676
00:40:44,561 --> 00:40:45,771
that's why you don't know.

677
00:40:45,841 --> 00:40:47,369
That way...

678
00:40:47,442 --> 00:40:48,971
you don't have an ac in this room.

679
00:40:49,364 --> 00:40:51,372
You're such a country-mouse, Mannu!

680
00:40:51,445 --> 00:40:52,658
Ac's in the bedroom.

681
00:40:52,728 --> 00:40:54,583
No one keeps expensive
things on display.

682
00:40:54,649 --> 00:40:57,369
Look at the People who come
into the drawing room?

683
00:40:57,435 --> 00:40:59,225
All afternoon, the
bell keeps ringing.

684
00:40:59,292 --> 00:41:00,821
'Have you tried this new soap? '

685
00:41:00,894 --> 00:41:02,902
'New perfumed incense sticks...

686
00:41:02,975 --> 00:41:04,733
free matches with each pack.'

687
00:41:04,801 --> 00:41:06,907
'Ls your Water Purifier okay? '

688
00:41:06,978 --> 00:41:09,468
'New pest control with
herbal formula'

689
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:10,751
all excuses to come inside.

690
00:41:10,821 --> 00:41:12,350
They look around

691
00:41:12,423 --> 00:41:14,333
tell every burglar in town.

692
00:41:14,408 --> 00:41:16,352
Actually they're informers.

693
00:41:18,123 --> 00:41:20,133
You wanted my news, didn't you?

694
00:41:20,205 --> 00:41:22,924
One day you'll read in the Paper

695
00:41:22,991 --> 00:41:25,361
Housewife Murdered
in Broad daylight.

696
00:41:26,867 --> 00:41:28,624
You haven't changed a little bit.

697
00:41:28,692 --> 00:41:30,865
Still keep on babbling.

698
00:41:35,674 --> 00:41:37,912
But you've changed, Mannu.

699
00:41:37,979 --> 00:41:40,153
You've become quieter, pensive...

700
00:41:40,222 --> 00:41:42,078
...ls anything wrong?

701
00:41:48,228 --> 00:41:49,919
The candle's burnt out.

702
00:41:49,988 --> 00:41:51,746
Will you light another?

703
00:41:54,889 --> 00:41:56,484
Leave it.

704
00:41:56,555 --> 00:41:57,831
A rainy afternoon.

705
00:41:57,898 --> 00:41:59,527
Husband not home.

706
00:41:59,597 --> 00:42:02,762
No need to have a candlelit
romance with the Wife.

707
00:42:13,144 --> 00:42:15,000
Aunty!

708
00:42:16,667 --> 00:42:17,877
Aunty!

709
00:42:17,947 --> 00:42:19,475
Here

710
00:42:19,548 --> 00:42:20,597
Where?

711
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:22,843
In Mannu's room, dear.

712
00:42:30,117 --> 00:42:32,028
What happened?

713
00:42:32,103 --> 00:42:34,373
High fever since afternoon.

714
00:42:34,921 --> 00:42:36,198
How?

715
00:42:36,266 --> 00:42:40,360
Must have caught a chill.

716
00:42:40,942 --> 00:42:44,207
Sit. Are you in a hurry?

717
00:42:44,849 --> 00:42:47,983
Holy sweets from the prayer
service. Mom sent it.

718
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:51,893
I haven't yet found time
to go to the prayer room.

719
00:42:52,215 --> 00:42:54,453
I'll sit. You go.

720
00:42:57,276 --> 00:42:59,994
Mannu, will you have a little?

721
00:43:01,822 --> 00:43:03,734
And you?

722
00:43:03,809 --> 00:43:04,824
I've had

723
00:43:04,897 --> 00:43:06,556
Sit

724
00:43:20,974 --> 00:43:22,885
What mischief were you up to?

725
00:43:23,856 --> 00:43:25,767
Where was the chance?

726
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:30,574
Fell ill before doing anything?

727
00:43:32,663 --> 00:43:34,355
perhaps

728
00:43:40,510 --> 00:43:42,202
Why didn't you take the Holy sweets?

729
00:43:46,050 --> 00:43:48,190
I don't have leftovers

730
00:43:50,309 --> 00:43:52,930
really... remember that.

731
00:43:59,405 --> 00:44:01,316
I'll catch a cold as well...

732
00:44:07,411 --> 00:44:10,479
How do you know this
isn't a 'leftover'?

733
00:44:19,516 --> 00:44:21,428
This time I couldn't stop it.

734
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:24,572
They finalised it a day before.

735
00:44:25,281 --> 00:44:27,138
The wedding is in March...

736
00:44:48,661 --> 00:44:50,352
When did you arrive?

737
00:44:51,414 --> 00:44:53,074
Day before yesterday.

738
00:44:53,143 --> 00:44:55,633
On work or just a visit?

739
00:44:57,307 --> 00:44:58,835
Work.

740
00:44:59,165 --> 00:45:00,922
Factory work?

741
00:45:07,492 --> 00:45:09,403
I've left that job ages ago.

742
00:45:09,477 --> 00:45:11,266
Oh!

743
00:45:11,654 --> 00:45:13,696
I didn't know that.

744
00:45:13,769 --> 00:45:15,592
What are you doing now?

745
00:45:20,942 --> 00:45:22,854
Business.

746
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:24,715
Business?

747
00:45:25,747 --> 00:45:28,946
Now I realise why you're
into tobacco?

748
00:45:29,589 --> 00:45:30,801
What business?

749
00:45:33,433 --> 00:45:36,730
A TV serial production office.

750
00:45:37,596 --> 00:45:39,506
Don't lie, Mannu.

751
00:45:40,157 --> 00:45:42,015
Why should I lie?

752
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:43,991
You're making TV serials?

753
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:45,849
Yes

754
00:45:47,139 --> 00:45:48,897
My company makes them.

755
00:45:48,965 --> 00:45:51,138
You mean you work there

756
00:45:51,943 --> 00:45:53,538
Work there?

757
00:45:54,761 --> 00:45:56,585
It's our own office.

758
00:45:56,748 --> 00:45:58,341
Our office?

759
00:45:58,412 --> 00:46:00,421
There are other people as well?

760
00:46:02,511 --> 00:46:04,269
Just a couple of them.

761
00:46:05,074 --> 00:46:06,984
It's a private limited company.

762
00:46:07,059 --> 00:46:09,429
Have to have some shareholders.

763
00:46:10,198 --> 00:46:13,977
Actually speaking, I'm the owner.

764
00:46:14,777 --> 00:46:17,977
That's very good.

765
00:46:19,806 --> 00:46:21,334
Which TV serials have you made?

766
00:46:21,407 --> 00:46:22,618
Have I seen any of them?

767
00:46:25,346 --> 00:46:28,065
We haven't done anything
for national TV.

768
00:46:28,132 --> 00:46:30,174
All local stuff.

769
00:46:30,246 --> 00:46:31,905
Tell me the names. I'll tell Mom.

770
00:46:31,975 --> 00:46:33,351
She'll watch them.

771
00:46:39,021 --> 00:46:40,878
They're over now.

772
00:46:42,543 --> 00:46:44,400
Now there's talk of some
national level work.

773
00:46:44,465 --> 00:46:46,376
When that happens I'll tell you.

774
00:46:47,347 --> 00:46:49,389
Then you can all watch.

775
00:46:51,190 --> 00:46:53,101
That's why you've come to calcutta.

776
00:46:55,354 --> 00:46:57,593
There was a meeting at calcutta TV.

777
00:47:00,158 --> 00:47:02,069
They're selling some slots.

778
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:04,512
Slots...?

779
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:08,835
You won't understand

780
00:47:08,901 --> 00:47:10,757
and what's the use anyway?

781
00:47:13,224 --> 00:47:14,272
That's very good!

782
00:47:14,345 --> 00:47:16,038
You're doing really well in life.

783
00:47:18,029 --> 00:47:19,939
Must have been hard work.

784
00:47:21,166 --> 00:47:22,923
Yes it was.

785
00:47:25,906 --> 00:47:28,275
How's aunty? Is she well?

786
00:47:28,853 --> 00:47:31,026
Yes.

787
00:47:31,799 --> 00:47:33,655
Still in the same house?

788
00:47:33,721 --> 00:47:35,249
Yes

789
00:47:36,282 --> 00:47:39,482
but you won't recognise it.

790
00:47:40,125 --> 00:47:41,337
Why?

791
00:47:41,407 --> 00:47:42,935
Has everything changed?

792
00:47:43,969 --> 00:47:45,978
They've built a six-storey house.

793
00:47:46,051 --> 00:47:47,743
We have two floors.

794
00:47:48,133 --> 00:47:50,686
Floors or flats?

795
00:47:50,758 --> 00:47:52,702
Floors

796
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:55,814
The top floor's for Mom.

797
00:47:55,883 --> 00:47:57,510
Covered by marble.

798
00:47:57,580 --> 00:47:59,435
With attached bathroom and ac.

799
00:48:00,302 --> 00:48:02,311
Mom's prayer room is also
on the same floor.

800
00:48:02,384 --> 00:48:07,439
She doesn't have to climb up
and down with her arthritis.

801
00:48:21,439 --> 00:48:23,295
What's that?

802
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:25,216
You don't have to
cross the courtyard

803
00:48:25,282 --> 00:48:26,494
to use the bathroom.

804
00:48:26,564 --> 00:48:27,611
Nonsense,

805
00:48:27,684 --> 00:48:29,212
take this away!

806
00:48:29,285 --> 00:48:32,321
Does that mean people do it
sitting in their rooms?

807
00:48:32,392 --> 00:48:34,336
Take it out immediately!

808
00:48:37,772 --> 00:48:39,944
You can stay with us if you like

809
00:48:40,013 --> 00:48:42,055
no problems.

810
00:48:43,633 --> 00:48:45,390
That's what you're saying.

811
00:48:45,458 --> 00:48:47,467
Others at home might have problems.

812
00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:48,588
Others?

813
00:48:48,661 --> 00:48:51,150
My mother and the maid?

814
00:48:55,321 --> 00:48:56,916
You haven't married?

815
00:48:59,902 --> 00:49:01,726
Mom's looking for a girl.

816
00:49:01,791 --> 00:49:05,689
The carpenters are working
on the other floor.

817
00:49:05,763 --> 00:49:08,580
Mom wants me to settle there.

818
00:49:10,630 --> 00:49:12,420
What do you mean, 'looking
for a girl'?

819
00:49:13,577 --> 00:49:15,433
Nothing is final yet?

820
00:49:16,138 --> 00:49:17,995
No

821
00:49:18,316 --> 00:49:20,422
It's almost final,

822
00:49:20,942 --> 00:49:24,240
but Mom wants the wedding
in december.

823
00:49:25,106 --> 00:49:27,278
But that probably won't happen.

824
00:49:28,629 --> 00:49:30,485
Why?

825
00:49:30,551 --> 00:49:32,789
If we get the time slot,

826
00:49:32,857 --> 00:49:35,607
we have to start work
the serial immediately.

827
00:49:39,197 --> 00:49:42,582
My husband also had this idea once.

828
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,107
Heard there's lots of
money in TV serials.

829
00:49:48,037 --> 00:49:50,276
Earlier they said it was
like a Fixed deposit.

830
00:49:50,343 --> 00:49:53,541
Now it's suffering due to cost-cuts.

831
00:49:53,609 --> 00:49:56,840
He used to tell me. 'You
sit at home all day,

832
00:49:57,388 --> 00:50:00,358
let me start a company
in your name'.

833
00:50:00,590 --> 00:50:02,315
Why didn't you do it?

834
00:50:02,385 --> 00:50:06,282
Rubbish! Serial's are only
fun to watch on TV.

835
00:50:06,452 --> 00:50:08,526
Why get into it yourself?

836
00:50:08,918 --> 00:50:11,886
It's good I didn't. Otherwise

837
00:50:11,959 --> 00:50:14,231
I'd be your competitor now

838
00:50:17,757 --> 00:50:19,580
could have been my partner as well?

839
00:50:22,369 --> 00:50:25,666
The girl aunty likes,
where's she from?

840
00:50:29,189 --> 00:50:31,101
Delhi.

841
00:50:31,271 --> 00:50:34,536
Will she leave delhi to
settle in Bhagalpur?

842
00:50:34,859 --> 00:50:39,118
Why, haven't you settled elsewhere?

843
00:50:40,879 --> 00:50:42,670
This is a big city.

844
00:50:42,737 --> 00:50:47,442
There are huge shops, cinemas,
theatres...

845
00:50:49,270 --> 00:50:52,240
But when do you go out?

846
00:50:53,048 --> 00:50:55,384
I can watch TV at home at least.

847
00:50:55,451 --> 00:50:57,787
So many channels nowadays.

848
00:50:59,774 --> 00:51:01,947
We have a dish antenna as well.

849
00:51:02,016 --> 00:51:03,708
We receive all channels.

850
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:06,430
Mom's just like you,

851
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:08,541
watches TV all day.

852
00:51:18,029 --> 00:51:19,940
Have you seen the girl?

853
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:24,296
Mom has. I don't need to.

854
00:51:26,996 --> 00:51:29,103
You'll marry without
seeing the girl?

855
00:51:32,761 --> 00:51:34,289
You didn't see your husband either,

856
00:51:34,362 --> 00:51:35,442
before you got married.

857
00:51:37,245 --> 00:51:41,339
At least, that's what you told me.

858
00:51:41,504 --> 00:51:43,447
They say he's good looking.

859
00:51:43,969 --> 00:51:45,826
Six foot tall.

860
00:51:45,892 --> 00:51:47,103
Has a good job.

861
00:51:48,132 --> 00:51:51,038
This time, what can
I say to stop it?

862
00:51:51,591 --> 00:51:53,448
You're not a child,

863
00:51:53,513 --> 00:51:54,976
they can't marry you off forcibly.

864
00:51:55,051 --> 00:51:56,644
please Mannu, don't shout.

865
00:51:57,356 --> 00:51:59,365
Tell them clearly you won't marry.

866
00:51:59,437 --> 00:52:00,486
Come, I'll go and speak to your Mom.

867
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:02,470
You've got fever, Mannu.

868
00:52:04,081 --> 00:52:05,938
To hell with the fever.

869
00:52:06,003 --> 00:52:08,241
They finalised this two days ago

870
00:52:08,309 --> 00:52:10,034
and you're telling me now?

871
00:52:11,224 --> 00:52:13,167
I deliberately didn't.

872
00:52:13,881 --> 00:52:15,540
You'd have felt bad.

873
00:52:17,532 --> 00:52:19,444
And do I feel any better now?

874
00:52:21,567 --> 00:52:23,707
You'll feel bad for
a couple of days.

875
00:52:23,777 --> 00:52:25,306
Then you'll be alright.

876
00:52:29,061 --> 00:52:32,380
Oh! That means you want this too.

877
00:52:34,827 --> 00:52:36,737
All parents want

878
00:52:36,812 --> 00:52:40,262
their daughters to
settle down, Mannu.

879
00:52:43,793 --> 00:52:45,584
We'll settle down as well, Niru.

880
00:52:47,317 --> 00:52:49,423
Next month his company
is giving him a car.

881
00:52:50,455 --> 00:52:52,627
They finalised it two days ago.

882
00:52:53,979 --> 00:52:56,532
Iook... a diwali gift.

883
00:52:57,115 --> 00:52:58,873
Could you have given it?

884
00:53:03,586 --> 00:53:05,497
I can

885
00:53:06,469 --> 00:53:08,324
just give me a little time, Niru.
I'll do it, I promise.

886
00:53:08,389 --> 00:53:10,563
I'll buy you a diamond ring.

887
00:53:11,687 --> 00:53:16,000
You get loans these
days to buy cars.

888
00:53:17,037 --> 00:53:18,948
I'll also buy a car.

889
00:53:20,238 --> 00:53:23,111
And I'm six foot tall too.

890
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:28,494
See... Niru

891
00:53:28,566 --> 00:53:29,614
Mannu!

892
00:53:29,686 --> 00:53:31,061
I'm six foot tall too.
- Mannu!

893
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:52,610
Hello?

894
00:53:52,682 --> 00:53:54,377
Hello, this is Sheila.

895
00:53:54,446 --> 00:53:56,357
Is everything okay?

896
00:53:56,433 --> 00:53:58,225
Yes, it's fine.

897
00:53:58,611 --> 00:54:00,622
Had problems finding the place?

898
00:54:00,694 --> 00:54:02,223
No, I didn't

899
00:54:02,391 --> 00:54:04,151
did it rain?

900
00:54:04,218 --> 00:54:05,978
A little.

901
00:54:06,046 --> 00:54:08,953
Thank god... I forced you
to take the raincoat.

902
00:54:09,828 --> 00:54:12,002
Tell your friend that.

903
00:54:12,071 --> 00:54:13,600
Of course I will.

904
00:54:14,635 --> 00:54:18,086
These are things that
only women remember.

905
00:54:18,158 --> 00:54:19,567
Men can't.

906
00:54:19,632 --> 00:54:21,676
Not bad! I see the mobile
has its virtues.

907
00:54:21,747 --> 00:54:23,408
Even the dumb have begun to speak!

908
00:54:23,478 --> 00:54:25,139
No, it's not the mobile.

909
00:54:25,210 --> 00:54:26,489
It's the person who gave it to me.

910
00:54:26,554 --> 00:54:29,941
Really? Have you had lunch?

911
00:54:30,016 --> 00:54:31,228
No, I haven't.

912
00:54:31,298 --> 00:54:33,208
What? You haven't eaten yet?

913
00:54:33,283 --> 00:54:34,748
I'll eat soon.

914
00:54:35,785 --> 00:54:37,892
I'm busy now, can I call you back?

915
00:54:37,963 --> 00:54:40,838
Of course, bye.

916
00:54:43,412 --> 00:54:45,586
Who gave you that mobile?

917
00:54:46,616 --> 00:54:48,146
Someone

918
00:54:48,218 --> 00:54:50,075
and who is that 'someone'?

919
00:54:51,102 --> 00:54:52,315
You tell me.

920
00:54:52,384 --> 00:54:54,078
I'm asking you, you tell me.

921
00:54:54,948 --> 00:54:56,805
But you must have guessed something.

922
00:54:56,871 --> 00:54:57,921
You tell me.

923
00:54:59,755 --> 00:55:02,576
The girl who's going to marry you?

924
00:55:04,818 --> 00:55:06,577
Why are you laughing?

925
00:55:07,767 --> 00:55:09,874
Thank goodness you didn't
make TV serials.

926
00:55:09,945 --> 00:55:11,223
They would have been utter flops.

927
00:55:11,387 --> 00:55:13,781
No imagination at all!

928
00:55:14,368 --> 00:55:16,280
Then who was it?

929
00:55:18,278 --> 00:55:19,873
My secretary.

930
00:55:20,906 --> 00:55:22,816
You've even kept a secretary?

931
00:55:23,789 --> 00:55:25,001
How else could I manage?

932
00:55:25,071 --> 00:55:26,120
I would be there,

933
00:55:26,192 --> 00:55:27,722
who would look after my work here?

934
00:55:28,852 --> 00:55:31,028
And she has a mobile phone too?

935
00:55:32,634 --> 00:55:34,296
Actually it's mine.

936
00:55:34,366 --> 00:55:35,577
But she keeps it with her.

937
00:55:35,648 --> 00:55:37,657
I use it whenever
I come to calcutta.

938
00:55:40,453 --> 00:55:41,917
What does she look like...

939
00:55:41,992 --> 00:55:44,547
...your secretary?

940
00:55:47,759 --> 00:55:48,971
Attractive

941
00:55:49,041 --> 00:55:51,217
Speaks good English?

942
00:55:52,568 --> 00:55:53,780
Okay.

943
00:55:53,851 --> 00:55:55,706
Married

944
00:55:57,629 --> 00:55:59,227
Unmarried.

945
00:56:02,181 --> 00:56:04,038
Be careful, Mannu.

946
00:56:04,103 --> 00:56:06,278
These girls are not good.

947
00:56:07,085 --> 00:56:10,385
But she's nice.

948
00:56:11,154 --> 00:56:13,164
You're still the same... idiot.

949
00:56:13,237 --> 00:56:14,613
She asked if you had eaten,

950
00:56:14,678 --> 00:56:15,727
and you immediately melted.

951
00:56:20,447 --> 00:56:22,360
I'm not an idiot any more Niru.

952
00:56:23,653 --> 00:56:25,663
Now I can tell the difference
between good and bad.

953
00:56:25,736 --> 00:56:27,365
The way you flirted,

954
00:56:27,435 --> 00:56:30,470
It's good, it wasn't in
front of your fiance.

955
00:56:31,118 --> 00:56:33,839
In front of her, I would
have spoken differently.

956
00:56:33,906 --> 00:56:36,080
Really?

957
00:56:36,149 --> 00:56:37,678
Do you know what relation,

958
00:56:37,752 --> 00:56:39,730
your husband has with his secretary?

959
00:56:39,805 --> 00:56:42,425
She is old and about to retire.

960
00:56:42,495 --> 00:56:44,408
That's even worse.

961
00:56:44,483 --> 00:56:46,339
Now he'll have a new secretary.

962
00:56:46,404 --> 00:56:48,261
She will certainly be young.

963
00:56:50,507 --> 00:56:52,419
Let her be.

964
00:56:52,494 --> 00:56:54,918
If something has to happen,

965
00:56:54,993 --> 00:56:56,457
can I stop it?

966
00:56:57,877 --> 00:57:00,216
I don't worry about all
that any more, Mannu.

967
00:57:01,019 --> 00:57:03,093
Do you know that there
are a lot of problems

968
00:57:03,164 --> 00:57:04,760
for a rich man's wife,

969
00:57:04,830 --> 00:57:07,738
When and where is he going,

970
00:57:07,810 --> 00:57:09,986
Is he in good health,
did he reach safely?

971
00:57:10,376 --> 00:57:11,588
Did he eat well?

972
00:57:11,657 --> 00:57:13,570
Oh no! You've been here so long

973
00:57:13,644 --> 00:57:16,136
and I haven't fed you a thing!

974
00:57:16,208 --> 00:57:17,355
I don't want to eat.

975
00:57:17,425 --> 00:57:18,476
That won't do.

976
00:57:18,549 --> 00:57:19,596
This is the first time you've come.

977
00:57:19,669 --> 00:57:22,159
Actually I'm not allowed.

978
00:57:22,231 --> 00:57:23,924
I'm on Herbal life.

979
00:57:23,993 --> 00:57:25,687
I have to skip lunch.

980
00:57:25,757 --> 00:57:27,617
So what if you eat lunch once,

981
00:57:27,681 --> 00:57:29,276
hell won't break loose.

982
00:57:29,603 --> 00:57:31,462
If your secretary doesn't like it,

983
00:57:31,528 --> 00:57:32,807
tell her you were forced to eat,

984
00:57:32,874 --> 00:57:34,336
so you couldn't refuse.

985
00:57:36,331 --> 00:57:37,414
Forced by whom

986
00:57:37,486 --> 00:57:39,344
Me. Who else?

987
00:57:40,435 --> 00:57:42,740
My secretary doesn't know you.

988
00:57:43,063 --> 00:57:45,073
What do I tell her?

989
00:57:45,146 --> 00:57:47,964
Say it was... your girlfriend.

990
00:57:48,831 --> 00:57:49,879
Sure?

991
00:57:49,953 --> 00:57:51,164
Ya.

992
00:57:51,234 --> 00:57:54,053
Your husband won't be angry?

993
00:57:54,117 --> 00:57:55,877
As if you're going to tell him.

994
00:57:55,945 --> 00:57:57,857
What would you like to eat?

995
00:57:58,445 --> 00:58:00,301
What do you have in the house?

996
00:58:01,329 --> 00:58:02,378
You can't eat that.

997
00:58:02,450 --> 00:58:03,499
Why not?

998
00:58:03,571 --> 00:58:04,621
It's just bland pish-pash,

999
00:58:04,694 --> 00:58:06,258
Stomach upset?

1000
00:58:06,329 --> 00:58:08,949
No. My dietician told me,

1001
00:58:09,020 --> 00:58:10,429
to have this on Fridays.

1002
00:58:11,999 --> 00:58:13,310
I'll have that too.

1003
00:58:13,377 --> 00:58:14,393
Rubbish.

1004
00:58:14,467 --> 00:58:16,193
I can't send you off like that

1005
00:58:16,710 --> 00:58:18,568
Then what?

1006
00:58:18,634 --> 00:58:21,005
I'm taking your raincoat, Mannu.

1007
00:58:21,069 --> 00:58:22,729
It might rain on the way.

1008
00:58:22,801 --> 00:58:24,329
On the way

1009
00:58:24,404 --> 00:58:26,445
The shop's close by.

1010
00:58:26,517 --> 00:58:28,691
You need to go to the shop now?

1011
00:58:29,208 --> 00:58:30,421
That's just my luck.

1012
00:58:30,490 --> 00:58:32,502
Two huge servants in this house,

1013
00:58:32,573 --> 00:58:34,364
have you seen even one of them?

1014
00:58:34,914 --> 00:58:36,924
Will you go alone?
- Yes

1015
00:58:36,996 --> 00:58:38,209
I'll come with you.

1016
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:40,801
You and my husband are the same.

1017
00:58:40,873 --> 00:58:42,731
Always pampering me.

1018
00:58:42,796 --> 00:58:43,877
Why? Am I a child?

1019
00:58:43,950 --> 00:58:45,413
Will I get lost?

1020
00:58:46,449 --> 00:58:47,662
Listen, sit here.

1021
00:58:47,732 --> 00:58:49,261
If the bell rings,

1022
00:58:49,335 --> 00:58:50,415
don't open the door.

1023
00:58:50,488 --> 00:58:52,150
You can't trust anyone.

1024
00:58:52,219 --> 00:58:53,430
And if your servants come?

1025
00:58:53,502 --> 00:58:55,292
They have the back door key.

1026
00:58:56,064 --> 00:58:58,236
And when you're back?

1027
00:58:59,909 --> 00:59:01,953
I'll ring the bell three times.

1028
00:59:02,088 --> 00:59:03,684
Understood?

1029
00:59:03,756 --> 00:59:04,967
What's the need, Niru?

1030
00:59:05,037 --> 00:59:06,730
We were fine chatting here.

1031
00:59:06,798 --> 00:59:07,847
We'll chat again.

1032
00:59:07,921 --> 00:59:10,478
What's the phrase...?

1033
00:59:10,550 --> 00:59:12,341
'After the break'!

1034
01:00:01,587 --> 01:00:03,446
You all go

1035
01:00:06,392 --> 01:00:08,251
What happened? Suddenly?

1036
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:12,098
I've applied for a car loan.

1037
01:00:12,162 --> 01:00:14,020
It'll take around 24 hours.

1038
01:00:18,379 --> 01:00:19,723
What colours did you see?

1039
01:00:21,326 --> 01:00:24,528
There's silver, gold,
blue, off white.

1040
01:00:26,774 --> 01:00:28,370
Was this colour there?

1041
01:00:30,942 --> 01:00:32,537
No they don't have that.

1042
01:00:33,250 --> 01:00:35,423
If you had tried harder
you would've got it.

1043
01:00:37,192 --> 01:00:39,265
My wedding sari is also this colour.

1044
01:00:41,451 --> 01:00:42,794
I had also told them,

1045
01:00:43,824 --> 01:00:45,681
that unless they match
the car to my outfit,

1046
01:00:45,842 --> 01:00:47,600
I won't go.

1047
01:00:48,952 --> 01:00:51,127
They're sending the
car in this colour.

1048
01:00:52,572 --> 01:00:54,329
You get roses in this colour.

1049
01:00:54,493 --> 01:00:56,570
Whatever colour I buy,

1050
01:00:57,537 --> 01:00:59,134
I'll cover it with roses.

1051
01:01:00,263 --> 01:01:01,378
Then it'll match?

1052
01:01:01,450 --> 01:01:02,979
Which match are you talking about?

1053
01:01:03,052 --> 01:01:04,908
The one you were saying...

1054
01:01:04,974 --> 01:01:06,831
The one you were saying
the sari and the car.

1055
01:01:06,993 --> 01:01:09,068
That takes real guts.

1056
01:01:10,230 --> 01:01:13,232
A loan for a car, just
needs guts for a day,

1057
01:01:13,562 --> 01:01:15,573
but not a life time.

1058
01:01:16,701 --> 01:01:18,298
Want to see real guts?

1059
01:01:19,652 --> 01:01:21,181
You've known me for eight years.

1060
01:01:22,214 --> 01:01:24,225
You couldn't find a better
time to prove it?

1061
01:01:24,299 --> 01:01:25,991
The day before my wedding?

1062
01:01:30,419 --> 01:01:31,763
You're right.

1063
01:01:32,887 --> 01:01:34,645
It's my fault.

1064
01:01:35,227 --> 01:01:36,887
I should've done it much before

1065
01:01:37,597 --> 01:01:40,567
but that would be forcing you.

1066
01:01:44,326 --> 01:01:46,663
Go home, Mannu. Don't be crazy!

1067
01:01:47,530 --> 01:01:49,059
What's 'crazy'?

1068
01:01:49,132 --> 01:01:50,991
All this madness.

1069
01:01:51,472 --> 01:01:52,904
Return the loan,

1070
01:01:53,940 --> 01:01:55,798
there's no need for a car.

1071
01:01:56,185 --> 01:01:57,714
Then you'll come with me, as it is?

1072
01:01:57,885 --> 01:01:59,641
Where?

1073
01:01:59,709 --> 01:02:01,566
I'll take care of everything, Niru.

1074
01:02:01,727 --> 01:02:03,485
You won't have any discomfort.

1075
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:09,250
What will you wear tomorrow?

1076
01:02:09,579 --> 01:02:11,109
Wear something nice.

1077
01:02:12,144 --> 01:02:14,000
My in-laws will be there.

1078
01:02:14,515 --> 01:02:15,925
I won't let it happen.

1079
01:02:15,989 --> 01:02:18,228
Mannu... that hurts!
- Let it.

1080
01:02:18,967 --> 01:02:22,169
You're mine. I won't
let you go anywhere.

1081
01:02:23,232 --> 01:02:24,574
I'm not going forever.

1082
01:02:25,602 --> 01:02:26,881
I'll be back.

1083
01:02:27,011 --> 01:02:29,383
Then see... we'll chat a lot.

1084
01:02:30,410 --> 01:02:32,267
We'll even go out together.

1085
01:02:32,333 --> 01:02:34,507
Everything won't end here.

1086
01:02:37,139 --> 01:02:38,995
Didn't I tell you

1087
01:02:40,022 --> 01:02:46,198
I don't like having 'leftovers'!

1088
01:02:46,306 --> 01:02:47,649
I told them so many times

1089
01:02:48,678 --> 01:02:50,916
to match the colours to my bangles.

1090
01:02:52,521 --> 01:02:54,377
They've made it so light,

1091
01:02:55,404 --> 01:02:57,263
see.

1092
01:03:06,876 --> 01:03:08,089
Sir... Please listen!

1093
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:09,689
I'm here... this side...
Please come here.

1094
01:03:09,761 --> 01:03:11,619
I can't speak loudly.

1095
01:03:11,683 --> 01:03:13,543
Yes, what?

1096
01:03:13,703 --> 01:03:15,977
Will you open the door, please?
I need to use the bathroom.

1097
01:03:18,415 --> 01:03:19,627
Why?

1098
01:03:19,696 --> 01:03:22,189
I've been looking all over,
for a public urinal.

1099
01:03:22,357 --> 01:03:24,113
Which house should I go?

1100
01:03:24,439 --> 01:03:26,996
It's afternoon.
Men have gone to work.

1101
01:03:27,066 --> 01:03:30,203
There are only women at home
I can't go there... please.

1102
01:03:30,912 --> 01:03:33,732
There might be a woman here.
- Didn't she go out?

1103
01:03:33,797 --> 01:03:35,972
Wearing a raincoat the
windows opened...

1104
01:03:36,040 --> 01:03:37,570
I took courage and looked in.

1105
01:03:37,738 --> 01:03:39,498
Otherwise my bladder will burst!

1106
01:03:39,662 --> 01:03:41,419
please try to understand...

1107
01:03:46,614 --> 01:03:48,143
Wait

1108
01:04:03,215 --> 01:04:04,493
One for me as well.

1109
01:04:07,381 --> 01:04:08,593
See what happens when,

1110
01:04:08,664 --> 01:04:11,156
the doors and windows
are always shut.

1111
01:04:11,227 --> 01:04:14,044
Smells so stuffy.

1112
01:04:16,609 --> 01:04:17,888
Have you finished?

1113
01:04:18,052 --> 01:04:20,127
How else would I be
talking so calmly?

1114
01:04:20,841 --> 01:04:22,699
Okay... leave now.

1115
01:04:23,084 --> 01:04:24,613
Where?

1116
01:04:26,608 --> 01:04:28,467
You finished using the bathroom,
now leave.

1117
01:04:29,493 --> 01:04:31,349
Where?

1118
01:04:31,414 --> 01:04:33,273
I'll go in a such a hurry?

1119
01:04:33,337 --> 01:04:35,196
Won't even wait for her?

1120
01:04:35,677 --> 01:04:38,716
No sir.
Settle the matter.

1121
01:04:40,068 --> 01:04:41,926
What matter?

1122
01:04:41,990 --> 01:04:43,849
Let madam return first.

1123
01:04:44,876 --> 01:04:46,732
Do you know how long I've
been waiting outside?

1124
01:04:47,757 --> 01:04:50,577
I come every afternoon,
hoping to catch her.

1125
01:04:50,644 --> 01:04:52,499
Today I couldn't bear it.

1126
01:04:53,527 --> 01:04:56,346
Rang the bell once. I knew
she wouldn't answer.

1127
01:04:57,374 --> 01:04:59,613
Oh, that was you?

1128
01:04:59,681 --> 01:05:01,146
Remember?

1129
01:05:01,316 --> 01:05:03,324
Just imagine, how long I've
been standing outside.

1130
01:05:04,039 --> 01:05:06,856
A rainy day, cold and damp,

1131
01:05:07,435 --> 01:05:11,981
no sweat. Can't blame my bladder?

1132
01:05:13,012 --> 01:05:15,983
That's my fate! Worse
than a dog's life!

1133
01:05:17,498 --> 01:05:22,240
My own house... my bathroom...
and I cant use it.

1134
01:05:24,226 --> 01:05:28,324
Oh, sorry! You're...

1135
01:05:28,490 --> 01:05:29,922
You got off the rickshaw...

1136
01:05:30,094 --> 01:05:31,851
...you rang the doorbell...

1137
01:05:31,919 --> 01:05:34,092
...the door opened... shut...

1138
01:05:34,805 --> 01:05:36,657
...I sensed it right away.

1139
01:05:36,822 --> 01:05:40,506
But this raincoat scene
was a bit new.

1140
01:05:42,493 --> 01:05:44,352
Can I ask you something directly?

1141
01:05:45,476 --> 01:05:47,233
How much is she charging?

1142
01:05:49,223 --> 01:05:50,437
Meaning?

1143
01:05:50,603 --> 01:05:52,994
Nothing is free of cost,

1144
01:05:53,325 --> 01:05:55,402
You have to pay something for it.

1145
01:05:59,736 --> 01:06:02,554
What rubbish are you talking?
- Rubbish? Why?

1146
01:06:02,619 --> 01:06:04,478
On a rainy afternoon,

1147
01:06:04,543 --> 01:06:06,400
you quitely want to fix up
everything and disappear?

1148
01:06:07,748 --> 01:06:09,275
Don't have to tell me everything,

1149
01:06:09,348 --> 01:06:11,206
I need to know some details.

1150
01:06:14,155 --> 01:06:16,329
Will you tell me or I'll
ask her when she returns?

1151
01:06:18,451 --> 01:06:19,860
She was right.

1152
01:06:20,182 --> 01:06:21,777
You're very suspicious.

1153
01:06:23,130 --> 01:06:26,327
But weren't you going to japan?

1154
01:06:27,614 --> 01:06:29,473
Japan?

1155
01:06:30,499 --> 01:06:32,990
I had work in delhi. She
probably knows that.

1156
01:06:34,345 --> 01:06:36,204
I didn't go.

1157
01:06:36,365 --> 01:06:38,123
I just lied.

1158
01:06:38,448 --> 01:06:41,004
Would'nt have been wise to
leave station at that time.

1159
01:06:42,132 --> 01:06:44,524
Every afternoon I regularly come

1160
01:06:45,882 --> 01:06:47,740
and wait in case I can catch her.

1161
01:06:49,728 --> 01:06:51,902
Who told you this stuff about japan?

1162
01:06:53,572 --> 01:06:56,392
She did. She said that,

1163
01:06:56,458 --> 01:06:58,250
'My husband's on the plane,
going to japan today'.

1164
01:06:58,318 --> 01:06:59,691
Wait, wait, wait.

1165
01:06:59,789 --> 01:07:03,056
You thought I'm her husband?

1166
01:07:04,082 --> 01:07:05,942
Then?

1167
01:07:06,455 --> 01:07:09,459
Then I really must be looking young.

1168
01:07:10,814 --> 01:07:12,989
And thank you very much
for making my day!

1169
01:07:16,583 --> 01:07:17,957
I didn't understand.

1170
01:07:18,119 --> 01:07:21,321
Look sir, I've nothing
to do with her.

1171
01:07:22,350 --> 01:07:27,092
I'm the landlord.

1172
01:07:30,042 --> 01:07:31,896
You've chosen this room?

1173
01:07:33,021 --> 01:07:34,780
Who?
- You

1174
01:07:37,732 --> 01:07:39,591
Why should I take a room?

1175
01:07:39,655 --> 01:07:41,512
I've just come to meet her
and I'll soon leave.

1176
01:07:42,540 --> 01:07:44,714
You'll come back again with
your luggage tomorrow.

1177
01:07:45,745 --> 01:07:48,236
Fine, tell me one thing. How
much did she let it out for?

1178
01:07:49,267 --> 01:07:50,480
Sublet?

1179
01:07:50,647 --> 01:07:53,040
How much is she charging
for the room?

1180
01:07:55,551 --> 01:07:56,829
You asshole!

1181
01:07:57,858 --> 01:07:59,714
please get out!

1182
01:07:59,779 --> 01:08:01,637
Or else I'll throw you out!

1183
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:03,555
Shall I call them?

1184
01:08:03,625 --> 01:08:05,482
Who?
- The neighbours.

1185
01:08:05,964 --> 01:08:08,839
Whose house? Who's the asshole?

1186
01:08:08,945 --> 01:08:10,288
It will be proved immediately.

1187
01:08:10,932 --> 01:08:13,489
Listen, if you really need to rent,

1188
01:08:13,559 --> 01:08:15,735
get the real information from me.

1189
01:08:17,086 --> 01:08:19,905
'Wives and homes' Should
be taken very seriously.

1190
01:08:20,546 --> 01:08:23,101
Now tell me what's the rate?

1191
01:08:23,909 --> 01:08:25,668
Why should she sublet?

1192
01:08:26,058 --> 01:08:28,297
Who sublets? people who need money.

1193
01:08:28,621 --> 01:08:30,480
These people are quite rich.

1194
01:08:30,865 --> 01:08:33,356
So this is the story she was
feeding you, all this while?

1195
01:08:34,391 --> 01:08:36,248
Therefore, these rich guys...

1196
01:08:36,313 --> 01:08:38,168
are slyly renting this place
to a furniture man!

1197
01:08:38,330 --> 01:08:40,089
Furniture man?

1198
01:08:40,670 --> 01:08:43,610
Those who've transformed this
room into a storage-dump.

1199
01:08:44,002 --> 01:08:45,215
What do you think?

1200
01:08:45,285 --> 01:08:46,815
All this is their furniture?

1201
01:08:46,888 --> 01:08:49,128
Come tomorrow you'll see new stuff.

1202
01:08:49,196 --> 01:08:51,621
Two truckloads of furniture
go out everyday

1203
01:08:52,208 --> 01:08:54,828
They hire it out for theatres
and shootings.

1204
01:08:54,897 --> 01:08:56,427
And bring them back at night.

1205
01:08:57,719 --> 01:09:00,277
But this is their family's
antique collection.

1206
01:09:01,308 --> 01:09:03,166
Theirs?

1207
01:09:03,647 --> 01:09:06,040
Then she must've said, the
house is also theirs.

1208
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:10,858
Can't believe it.

1209
01:09:11,433 --> 01:09:13,740
Why would they turn their
house into a storage-dump?

1210
01:09:15,216 --> 01:09:17,587
All for subsistence.

1211
01:09:21,498 --> 01:09:25,596
But... her husband has a decent job,

1212
01:09:27,267 --> 01:09:29,124
goes abroad often!

1213
01:09:32,168 --> 01:09:34,889
You think he's an Indian
living abroad?

1214
01:09:36,013 --> 01:09:37,773
Have you seen the bathroom?

1215
01:09:38,803 --> 01:09:40,661
No!
- You've been here for two hours

1216
01:09:40,823 --> 01:09:43,859
and you haven't been
to the bathroom?

1217
01:09:44,569 --> 01:09:45,783
I had just gone

1218
01:09:45,851 --> 01:09:47,383
and I'm thinking of going again...

1219
01:09:48,031 --> 01:09:49,627
come with me, I'll show you...

1220
01:09:50,274 --> 01:09:52,134
come, sir. Come over here.

1221
01:09:55,083 --> 01:09:58,864
Come and see for yourself.
Come on please.

1222
01:10:06,940 --> 01:10:08,468
See...

1223
01:10:11,745 --> 01:10:13,276
are you a relative?

1224
01:10:16,234 --> 01:10:18,725
Guest
- Whose guest?

1225
01:10:22,319 --> 01:10:26,255
An old acquaintance.

1226
01:10:26,904 --> 01:10:28,085
I see,

1227
01:10:28,186 --> 01:10:31,290
Whose acquaintance? His or Hers?

1228
01:10:37,382 --> 01:10:39,240
Niru

1229
01:10:40,268 --> 01:10:43,405
I know her only by that name.

1230
01:10:46,999 --> 01:10:48,789
I thought as much.

1231
01:10:49,818 --> 01:10:51,673
Then what exactly is the connection?

1232
01:10:54,623 --> 01:10:57,595
Nothing specific, presently...

1233
01:10:59,687 --> 01:11:01,929
We grew up
village, together.

1234
01:11:04,239 --> 01:11:07,689
Nothing specific 'presently'...
but you used to be 'in the past'!

1235
01:11:10,103 --> 01:11:12,374
An affair to remember

1236
01:11:13,851 --> 01:11:15,710
Look, don't joke around.

1237
01:11:16,737 --> 01:11:19,074
This is my personal matter
- Sorry... sorry...

1238
01:11:20,582 --> 01:11:22,440
as for your house,

1239
01:11:22,505 --> 01:11:24,362
If there's something illegal,

1240
01:11:24,521 --> 01:11:26,281
that too if it's really yours,

1241
01:11:27,311 --> 01:11:29,168
why not call the police?

1242
01:11:29,553 --> 01:11:31,729
That I certainly will. Soon.

1243
01:11:33,079 --> 01:11:36,281
The day the girl burns
herself with petrol,

1244
01:11:36,925 --> 01:11:38,783
I'll go straight to the police,

1245
01:11:38,848 --> 01:11:40,061
I'll bring them to you,

1246
01:11:40,130 --> 01:11:41,658
and tell them, 'arrest him...

1247
01:11:42,244 --> 01:11:43,904
...lt's all because of him'.

1248
01:11:46,024 --> 01:11:47,369
All because of me?

1249
01:11:47,756 --> 01:11:51,210
If you don't have the guts

1250
01:11:51,282 --> 01:11:53,141
why get into romance, Mister?

1251
01:11:53,206 --> 01:11:56,340
Or did you find a rich
bride with a fat dowry?

1252
01:11:58,010 --> 01:11:59,870
Then why bother about her?

1253
01:12:02,818 --> 01:12:09,157
And then one fine day, just
like any other tourist...

1254
01:12:09,547 --> 01:12:12,367
You suddenly arrive to visit her...

1255
01:12:12,434 --> 01:12:15,250
'Hello! How are you?
Are you happy or not? '

1256
01:12:16,278 --> 01:12:19,098
But she...
- She won't tell you anything.

1257
01:12:19,677 --> 01:12:21,018
A woman never confides,

1258
01:12:21,086 --> 01:12:22,941
never submits,

1259
01:12:23,008 --> 01:12:26,787
specially to him who's dumped her.

1260
01:12:26,949 --> 01:12:29,222
I didn't dump her.

1261
01:12:39,799 --> 01:12:41,209
I wasn't well off

1262
01:12:44,094 --> 01:12:49,151
so her mom found her a
more suitable match.

1263
01:12:52,106 --> 01:12:56,202
I'm seeing her for the first
time after her marriage.

1264
01:13:03,320 --> 01:13:05,177
Are you married?

1265
01:13:07,166 --> 01:13:08,379
No

1266
01:13:08,544 --> 01:13:09,976
Why? Because you were jilted?

1267
01:13:13,513 --> 01:13:15,108
I worked in a jute mill.

1268
01:13:16,782 --> 01:13:18,638
It's closed down.

1269
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:20,558
Now I'm unemployed.

1270
01:13:22,549 --> 01:13:24,886
Can't even think of marriage.

1271
01:13:26,393 --> 01:13:28,252
What will you do now?

1272
01:13:35,625 --> 01:13:36,902
Borrow from my friends.

1273
01:13:38,893 --> 01:13:40,751
If I can collect some money

1274
01:13:41,712 --> 01:13:43,570
I could start a business.

1275
01:13:45,557 --> 01:13:47,417
Well supposing you do manage,

1276
01:13:49,725 --> 01:13:53,176
will you be able to rescue
her from this mess?

1277
01:13:57,095 --> 01:13:59,334
Rescue? Where will I take her?

1278
01:14:03,441 --> 01:14:04,719
At least try to explain

1279
01:14:06,711 --> 01:14:08,567
she doesn't have food,

1280
01:14:08,633 --> 01:14:10,488
but at least there's
a roof over her head.

1281
01:14:10,553 --> 01:14:12,412
Soon, she won't even have that.

1282
01:14:13,438 --> 01:14:15,297
She'll be on the streets.

1283
01:14:18,758 --> 01:14:20,103
She won't listen.

1284
01:14:22,092 --> 01:14:23,949
We spoke for so long

1285
01:14:26,192 --> 01:14:27,787
but she didn't say anything.

1286
01:14:28,917 --> 01:14:30,677
What will she say?

1287
01:14:31,705 --> 01:14:35,867
That her husband
is a fraud? Told this.

1288
01:14:37,793 --> 01:14:41,181
I get this letter of guarantee
from a big company

1289
01:14:42,218 --> 01:14:44,586
to rent the house to him.

1290
01:14:45,101 --> 01:14:46,957
And I give it to them.

1291
01:14:47,983 --> 01:14:51,764
Later, on enquiry, I find out
that the letter was forged.

1292
01:14:53,239 --> 01:14:55,611
He doesn't work for them at all.

1293
01:14:56,637 --> 01:14:58,495
In fact, he doesn't work anywhere!

1294
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:01,370
He's a total conman.

1295
01:15:01,892 --> 01:15:03,934
He's up to his neck in debt.

1296
01:15:05,290 --> 01:15:07,462
You can ask anyone here,

1297
01:15:07,533 --> 01:15:09,061
I'll take you.

1298
01:15:10,546 --> 01:15:13,233
Hasn't paid the electricity
bills for months.

1299
01:15:14,263 --> 01:15:16,753
They've cut the power.

1300
01:15:17,788 --> 01:15:19,644
The windows are always shut.

1301
01:15:19,805 --> 01:15:22,079
Ring the bell, they don't answer.

1302
01:15:22,594 --> 01:15:25,086
If there's no power, how
does the doorbell ring?

1303
01:15:25,479 --> 01:15:27,336
That way, they're very smart.

1304
01:15:28,363 --> 01:15:30,220
Got a battery-operated bell.

1305
01:15:34,130 --> 01:15:40,401
He comes back at dead
of night, sozzled.

1306
01:15:42,077 --> 01:15:43,609
My fair lady, I come back to thee...

1307
01:15:43,680 --> 01:15:44,893
and the Lady might be asleep.

1308
01:15:44,964 --> 01:15:47,005
If he knocks too loudly, the
neighbours might hear.

1309
01:15:47,077 --> 01:15:48,423
Creditors will find out.

1310
01:15:49,449 --> 01:15:51,940
They have their own timings.

1311
01:15:53,295 --> 01:15:54,505
He rings the bell

1312
01:15:54,575 --> 01:15:56,619
she immediately opens the door.

1313
01:15:58,357 --> 01:16:00,466
But when she got married
he was really well off.

1314
01:16:01,946 --> 01:16:04,766
We've all seen... it was
a lavish wedding indeed.

1315
01:16:05,089 --> 01:16:07,163
It all started sweet...

1316
01:16:07,712 --> 01:16:09,571
Then he lost his job
in an office scam...

1317
01:16:09,638 --> 01:16:11,495
...and things turned sour.

1318
01:16:12,970 --> 01:16:15,340
Changed his name, got another job...

1319
01:16:15,406 --> 01:16:19,888
There also, the same story.

1320
01:16:20,534 --> 01:16:24,631
Who will trust you if
you keep on cheating?

1321
01:16:25,340 --> 01:16:31,680
Then he hit the bottle.

1322
01:16:32,711 --> 01:16:36,427
At first the girl was naive

1323
01:16:36,590 --> 01:16:38,347
now she's got smart.

1324
01:16:38,863 --> 01:16:40,272
Won't open the door at all.

1325
01:16:43,542 --> 01:16:46,035
What do I care?

1326
01:16:46,362 --> 01:16:48,470
The court eviction order
will come in 2 days,

1327
01:16:48,542 --> 01:16:49,887
police will break open the door

1328
01:16:49,950 --> 01:16:51,809
and throw them out on the streets.

1329
01:16:53,158 --> 01:16:56,292
Can't it be stopped?

1330
01:16:56,679 --> 01:16:59,819
How? He's defaulted thrice.

1331
01:16:59,885 --> 01:17:01,416
Not paid rent over 10 months.

1332
01:17:02,546 --> 01:17:04,306
What if you get your money?

1333
01:17:06,296 --> 01:17:09,115
I've heard that 71 times
in the last 6 months...

1334
01:17:09,181 --> 01:17:11,356
and the court... 55 times!

1335
01:17:12,063 --> 01:17:13,920
No one will listen now.

1336
01:17:19,755 --> 01:17:21,611
You won't have to listen.

1337
01:17:21,774 --> 01:17:23,534
I'll pay up.

1338
01:17:24,564 --> 01:17:26,802
Will 'pay up'? As in future tense?

1339
01:17:27,446 --> 01:17:30,580
No. Do you have your rent book?

1340
01:17:31,740 --> 01:17:33,082
Yes I do.

1341
01:17:37,316 --> 01:17:38,845
You'll settle the full amount?

1342
01:17:38,919 --> 01:17:40,777
What's the amount?

1343
01:17:40,842 --> 01:17:43,661
4 x 10 months... that's rs. 40,000.

1344
01:17:46,609 --> 01:17:48,467
That much isn't possible.

1345
01:17:49,495 --> 01:17:51,350
Then how much is possible?

1346
01:17:52,379 --> 01:17:54,236
If it's four a month,

1347
01:17:54,556 --> 01:17:56,153
I can give you three months' rent.

1348
01:17:56,223 --> 01:17:58,081
And the rest?

1349
01:17:58,596 --> 01:18:00,639
The rest you'll have to consider.

1350
01:18:05,838 --> 01:18:07,696
Tell me something...

1351
01:18:08,017 --> 01:18:09,611
Hasn't she told you anything?

1352
01:18:17,472 --> 01:18:19,545
But you have to promise
me one thing.

1353
01:18:22,501 --> 01:18:24,992
Tell the court not to harass them.

1354
01:18:26,026 --> 01:18:27,884
There's only rs.8,000 here.

1355
01:18:36,601 --> 01:18:37,814
Rs.4,000?

1356
01:18:37,882 --> 01:18:39,411
8 and 4... rs.12,000

1357
01:18:39,485 --> 01:18:41,343
This is 3 months' rent.

1358
01:18:43,588 --> 01:18:46,144
please consider till then.

1359
01:18:48,396 --> 01:18:50,952
And the rest?

1360
01:18:52,945 --> 01:18:56,725
If things haven't changed by then,

1361
01:18:59,676 --> 01:19:02,045
please let me know before
you do something drastic.

1362
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:04,416
Keep my name and address.

1363
01:19:08,326 --> 01:19:10,503
Where did this come from? You
were going to borrow yourself.

1364
01:19:12,175 --> 01:19:14,030
I visited 2 friends this morning.

1365
01:19:14,352 --> 01:19:15,947
I've collected rs. 12,000.

1366
01:19:22,750 --> 01:19:24,606
Can I ask you something?

1367
01:19:25,888 --> 01:19:27,416
please don't mind.

1368
01:19:31,338 --> 01:19:33,194
Is this your penance...

1369
01:19:37,106 --> 01:19:38,963
...or revenge?

1370
01:19:45,051 --> 01:19:46,648
Eat something.

1371
01:19:51,526 --> 01:19:53,896
Why are you so upset?

1372
01:19:56,429 --> 01:19:58,186
It was my mistake

1373
01:19:59,473 --> 01:20:01,068
I didn't realise,

1374
01:20:02,197 --> 01:20:05,430
you wanted to match your
car to your sari.

1375
01:20:08,831 --> 01:20:10,687
Tell me what do I do?

1376
01:20:11,267 --> 01:20:12,611
If I have to get married,

1377
01:20:13,640 --> 01:20:15,494
better do it with a smile, isn't it?

1378
01:20:16,137 --> 01:20:17,416
There's no point...

1379
01:20:17,482 --> 01:20:19,657
...crying and making
a useless scene.

1380
01:20:22,739 --> 01:20:24,147
Can I ask you something?

1381
01:20:28,091 --> 01:20:29,851
Have you really accepted
this marriage?

1382
01:20:32,799 --> 01:20:34,658
Do you really want an answer?

1383
01:20:38,666 --> 01:20:40,740
I haven't even seen him yet.

1384
01:20:41,454 --> 01:20:44,274
Then, why are you marrying him?

1385
01:20:47,222 --> 01:20:49,078
Just think... I'm not marrying him.

1386
01:20:50,106 --> 01:20:51,962
Then?

1387
01:20:52,990 --> 01:20:54,848
I'm marrying for the security.

1388
01:20:55,169 --> 01:20:58,241
That'll make my parents happy.

1389
01:20:59,721 --> 01:21:01,578
How many times shall I upset them?

1390
01:21:02,603 --> 01:21:06,384
parents... but that means
you're unhappy!

1391
01:21:08,950 --> 01:21:11,507
How can I answer that today, Mannu?

1392
01:21:15,360 --> 01:21:16,954
If we meet again,

1393
01:21:17,988 --> 01:21:19,845
and I can speak my heart
out, I'll tell you.

1394
01:21:22,345 --> 01:21:23,622
perhaps you won't tell me,

1395
01:21:23,787 --> 01:21:25,547
you'll hide it from me.

1396
01:21:26,574 --> 01:21:28,813
Like you hid the truth
about your marriage.

1397
01:21:30,419 --> 01:21:32,595
What do you want to hear?

1398
01:21:34,266 --> 01:21:36,441
That I'm unhappy?

1399
01:21:38,112 --> 01:21:39,966
If necessary, I'll make it up.

1400
01:21:41,251 --> 01:21:44,452
And I'll act in such a way that
you won't even understand.

1401
01:21:51,571 --> 01:21:54,889
Today's a happy day,
have some sweets.

1402
01:22:02,146 --> 01:22:06,886
Dear one, why are you so angry?

1403
01:22:29,961 --> 01:22:32,454
The wind has tilted

1404
01:22:33,102 --> 01:22:37,582
the picture on the wall

1405
01:22:38,711 --> 01:22:42,712
Unlike that monsoon's lost hours

1406
01:22:43,421 --> 01:22:49,759
Who knows how, who can say cracks
have eaten the walls away.

1407
01:22:50,151 --> 01:22:55,856
The wall's damp is like a wan face
On which a lifetime's tears race

1408
01:22:56,018 --> 01:23:04,505
The rains have come
glorious flowers

1409
01:23:04,572 --> 01:23:13,478
From Mathura a palanquin
on four shoulders

1410
01:23:20,946 --> 01:23:31,744
Where is my golden love this hour?

1411
01:23:32,390 --> 01:23:39,043
The courtyard is so lonely

1412
01:23:39,117 --> 01:23:44,823
The heavy monsoon shower down the
roof pours in frenzied power

1413
01:23:49,789 --> 01:23:54,432
On the wet windowpane The
rain writes again and again

1414
01:23:54,595 --> 01:23:59,557
Winding its way Over the
glass in tearful pain

1415
01:24:07,958 --> 01:24:15,193
From my eyes endless tears flow

1416
01:24:16,164 --> 01:24:23,908
In a stream that like
the Ganges shows

1417
01:24:47,568 --> 01:24:51,732
Silent afternoon vain Empty
like a deserted board game

1418
01:24:52,568 --> 01:24:56,851
No king or queen or players at all
To fill the vacuum with their call

1419
01:24:57,885 --> 01:25:01,667
a thousand times to swim I go

1420
01:25:04,616 --> 01:25:09,993
Still my desire to bathe
isn't fulfilled

1421
01:25:17,371 --> 01:25:22,747
dry tresses, dirty dresses,

1422
01:25:22,916 --> 01:25:29,482
a heart's joy killed

1423
01:25:29,548 --> 01:25:33,832
Everything it seems
will end the same

1424
01:25:34,355 --> 01:25:40,060
Was it the wind after all Tilting
the picture on the wall?

1425
01:25:42,144 --> 01:25:49,094
Dear one, why are you so angry?

1426
01:26:00,890 --> 01:26:03,129
All right, I know we
didn't get married.

1427
01:26:04,414 --> 01:26:06,010
That doesn't mean

1428
01:26:08,005 --> 01:26:10,111
you can't tell me
you are in trouble?

1429
01:26:12,748 --> 01:26:14,606
Have I become so distant to you?

1430
01:26:17,972 --> 01:26:20,045
Fortunately your landlord came.

1431
01:26:20,534 --> 01:26:22,292
So I found out.

1432
01:26:22,618 --> 01:26:25,885
I've paid three months' rent,

1433
01:26:27,169 --> 01:26:29,025
Here is the receipt.

1434
01:26:31,015 --> 01:26:32,872
Don't worry

1435
01:26:35,117 --> 01:26:37,420
They won't evict you immediately.

1436
01:26:38,705 --> 01:26:40,561
He gave me his word.

1437
01:26:42,164 --> 01:26:43,444
please don't hesitate
to accept this Niru.

1438
01:26:45,530 --> 01:26:47,771
It was fate that prevented
us from getting married.

1439
01:26:49,377 --> 01:26:52,796
Otherwise all your responsibility
would have been mine.

1440
01:27:00,816 --> 01:27:02,675
Your's Mannu.

1441
01:27:36,645 --> 01:27:38,173
Thank you, Mannu

1442
01:27:38,825 --> 01:27:41,382
Why thank me? You got the food.

1443
01:27:41,549 --> 01:27:42,977
For your raincoat.

1444
01:27:43,309 --> 01:27:46,348
Oh God! Who opened the windows?

1445
01:27:46,897 --> 01:27:48,756
Me.
- Why?

1446
01:27:48,823 --> 01:27:50,679
The rain has stopped.

1447
01:27:50,744 --> 01:27:52,918
This rain won't stop.
It'll start again soon.

1448
01:27:55,553 --> 01:27:57,410
Let them be, Niru.

1449
01:27:57,475 --> 01:27:59,329
I'm seeing you in daylight
after ages.

1450
01:27:59,396 --> 01:28:00,610
I told you Manoj,

1451
01:28:00,775 --> 01:28:03,813
if someone spots us together
there'll be trouble.

1452
01:28:05,614 --> 01:28:07,023
What took you so long?

1453
01:28:09,972 --> 01:28:11,831
The shopkeeper's quite weird.

1454
01:28:11,894 --> 01:28:13,754
Just a little drizzle...

1455
01:28:13,820 --> 01:28:15,828
...he shuts his shop
and goes to sleep.

1456
01:28:16,060 --> 01:28:19,196
Woke him up and made him cook.

1457
01:28:20,804 --> 01:28:22,399
Why did you bother?

1458
01:28:25,355 --> 01:28:29,134
Why? Is your secretary the only
one who can care about you?

1459
01:28:32,083 --> 01:28:33,941
I normally don't eat
in the afternoon.

1460
01:28:34,262 --> 01:28:36,338
I chew tobacco the whole day,
it kills my appetite.

1461
01:28:38,813 --> 01:28:41,307
Usually people have
candlelit dinners,

1462
01:28:41,956 --> 01:28:44,061
Today... have a candlelit lunch.

1463
01:28:54,196 --> 01:28:56,053
Are they good?

1464
01:28:58,297 --> 01:28:59,893
Not like home made ones.

1465
01:29:03,233 --> 01:29:04,640
Tell me, Mannu,

1466
01:29:04,802 --> 01:29:06,878
what's the point in keeping servants

1467
01:29:06,950 --> 01:29:09,125
if I have to go to the kitchen?

1468
01:29:11,757 --> 01:29:13,286
Do you cook sometimes?

1469
01:29:13,455 --> 01:29:15,213
Now and then.

1470
01:29:17,204 --> 01:29:19,064
When your husband's home?

1471
01:29:20,091 --> 01:29:22,262
As if he lets me!

1472
01:29:22,972 --> 01:29:26,294
He says, 'Why keep all
these servants then? '

1473
01:29:27,875 --> 01:29:33,220
Doesn't he want to eat
your cooking

1474
01:29:35,472 --> 01:29:37,643
I can't cook like before anymore.

1475
01:29:39,315 --> 01:29:41,174
If you're not in the habit,

1476
01:29:42,201 --> 01:29:44,692
you lose the touch.

1477
01:29:47,329 --> 01:29:48,859
Now eat.

1478
01:29:52,872 --> 01:29:57,515
One Friday afternoon, instead
of eating bland food...

1479
01:29:57,583 --> 01:29:59,441
You ate two puris (lndian bread)...

1480
01:30:00,404 --> 01:30:02,261
would your dietician get very angry?

1481
01:30:03,288 --> 01:30:05,145
Yes, he will.

1482
01:30:05,306 --> 01:30:07,383
It's all about balanced
diets, mister.

1483
01:30:09,057 --> 01:30:11,230
Do you know how much
I pay every month?

1484
01:30:11,939 --> 01:30:15,075
He takes my weight,
makes out a chart,

1485
01:30:15,786 --> 01:30:17,960
and prescribes...
- don't tell him you ate puris.

1486
01:30:19,246 --> 01:30:20,524
He'll surely find out.

1487
01:30:22,515 --> 01:30:24,373
'Going to parties lately? '

1488
01:30:26,683 --> 01:30:28,691
'Didn't I tell you
not to drink cola? '

1489
01:30:30,205 --> 01:30:32,063
'You must've eaten fried food! '

1490
01:30:35,974 --> 01:30:37,833
Then, tell him...

1491
01:30:39,117 --> 01:30:44,305
'My boyfriend forced me to eat.'

1492
01:30:48,730 --> 01:30:53,209
What would your fiance
say

1493
01:30:55,203 --> 01:30:57,061
What would she say?

1494
01:30:58,118 --> 01:31:00,261
What goes on between you
and your dietician,

1495
01:31:00,906 --> 01:31:02,764
my secretary and me.

1496
01:31:03,790 --> 01:31:05,649
These aren't meant to be discussed
between husbands and wives.

1497
01:31:16,290 --> 01:31:18,145
Hello!

1498
01:31:18,210 --> 01:31:20,068
Hello, Sheila again.

1499
01:31:20,133 --> 01:31:21,992
Yes

1500
01:31:22,154 --> 01:31:23,911
Is your work done?

1501
01:31:24,075 --> 01:31:27,179
Some of it.
- Had lunch? Or not?

1502
01:31:27,826 --> 01:31:30,644
I'm eating right now.
- Where? At a restaurant?

1503
01:31:31,672 --> 01:31:34,041
No... I'm eating puris.

1504
01:31:35,515 --> 01:31:37,373
Oh, you love puris?

1505
01:31:37,439 --> 01:31:39,613
I had asked you before.
Why didn't you tell me?

1506
01:31:39,681 --> 01:31:42,173
Would've made them for breakfast.
- Does everything need to be said?

1507
01:31:43,208 --> 01:31:45,065
Okay. Don't be late.

1508
01:31:45,130 --> 01:31:46,989
If there's water logging,
you'll be in trouble.

1509
01:31:47,054 --> 01:31:50,570
Ok. - Ok, thanks. - Ok, bye.

1510
01:31:56,089 --> 01:31:58,132
Will you be getting a new secretary?

1511
01:32:02,371 --> 01:32:04,230
After this one gets married.

1512
01:32:06,538 --> 01:32:08,065
Will you flirt with her too?

1513
01:32:11,022 --> 01:32:12,880
If she does, why not?

1514
01:32:17,048 --> 01:32:20,118
The raincoat, does it belong
to your secretary?

1515
01:32:21,600 --> 01:32:23,456
Why?

1516
01:32:24,481 --> 01:32:28,263
Ask her what perfume she uses?

1517
01:32:31,469 --> 01:32:33,064
Thank God, I had the raincoat.

1518
01:32:34,098 --> 01:32:35,955
It was so useful.

1519
01:32:38,906 --> 01:32:42,999
The servants,
keep the umbrellas.

1520
01:32:44,671 --> 01:32:49,732
If I'd kept looking
for it, you'd starve.

1521
01:32:51,402 --> 01:32:54,473
At least, there was your
secretary's raincoat.

1522
01:32:59,027 --> 01:33:00,885
Enough for me...

1523
01:33:00,950 --> 01:33:02,961
can't eat anymore, please finish it.

1524
01:33:05,214 --> 01:33:07,127
I deliberately didn't
get any sweets.

1525
01:33:07,682 --> 01:33:09,538
You never liked sweets.

1526
01:33:10,118 --> 01:33:11,461
Do you eat sweets now?

1527
01:33:17,392 --> 01:33:19,149
I should've brought the sweets.

1528
01:33:21,140 --> 01:33:22,998
After all, it's my first
visit to your house.

1529
01:33:27,421 --> 01:33:29,725
When your first serial is telecast

1530
01:33:29,792 --> 01:33:31,650
on the National TV, then bring some.

1531
01:33:32,676 --> 01:33:34,535
That day I'll cook.

1532
01:33:34,696 --> 01:33:37,898
We'll eat and watch
your serial together.

1533
01:33:38,702 --> 01:33:40,297
And your husband?

1534
01:33:41,329 --> 01:33:44,149
God knows where he'll be.

1535
01:33:44,216 --> 01:33:46,071
probably on tour.

1536
01:33:46,392 --> 01:33:47,987
And if...

1537
01:33:49,981 --> 01:33:51,774
my secretary wants me to watch
the serial with her?

1538
01:33:51,843 --> 01:33:54,399
Tell her someone else
asked you first.

1539
01:33:55,686 --> 01:33:58,179
Who? Girlfriend?

1540
01:34:04,595 --> 01:34:06,190
please Mannu, when you go back,

1541
01:34:06,261 --> 01:34:08,118
don't tell Mom you came here.

1542
01:34:11,068 --> 01:34:12,927
If you say so, I won't.

1543
01:34:13,088 --> 01:34:15,425
But, people might ask.

1544
01:34:16,453 --> 01:34:19,327
What's the use? There'll
be idle gossip

1545
01:34:20,233 --> 01:34:23,239
and your marriage is close.

1546
01:34:26,452 --> 01:34:30,735
If you can, do visit
us in Bhagalpur.

1547
01:34:33,629 --> 01:34:37,594
Always alone in this house...

1548
01:34:38,949 --> 01:34:40,807
You're right.

1549
01:34:40,871 --> 01:34:44,969
Sometimes... I wish I could
go some Place far away.

1550
01:34:46,958 --> 01:34:48,489
Where?

1551
01:34:49,878 --> 01:34:51,310
Anywhere

1552
01:34:53,305 --> 01:34:55,160
So what if I get stuck
in the bathroom?

1553
01:34:57,150 --> 01:34:59,969
The plane has to stoP somewhere,

1554
01:35:00,997 --> 01:35:02,855
and then again move on...

1555
01:35:03,881 --> 01:35:05,738
...l'll go with it.

1556
01:35:07,726 --> 01:35:09,583
Locked up all the way?

1557
01:35:13,494 --> 01:35:15,352
I am locked in here Mannu.

1558
01:35:16,635 --> 01:35:21,760
You think this luxury is everything?

1559
01:35:26,953 --> 01:35:28,811
That's true.

1560
01:35:29,838 --> 01:35:33,618
Can anyone stay locked
in a bathroom forever?

1561
01:35:35,221 --> 01:35:40,665
Believe me... Someone's bound to
come and open the door for you.

1562
01:35:44,258 --> 01:35:46,116
Really?

1563
01:35:47,078 --> 01:35:48,936
Yes

1564
01:35:51,885 --> 01:35:53,744
I don't hope for that
anymore, Mannu.

1565
01:35:55,828 --> 01:35:57,588
And Please, I beg of you,

1566
01:35:59,193 --> 01:36:01,430
don't show me any new dreams.

1567
01:36:05,345 --> 01:36:09,126
Fine, dear. Don't cry Niru...

1568
01:36:11,115 --> 01:36:14,893
please, Niru. please don't cry, Niru.

1569
01:36:29,380 --> 01:36:34,121
See? This is the result of watching
too many TV serials.

1570
01:36:40,918 --> 01:36:42,773
Sorry...

1571
01:36:47,584 --> 01:36:49,438
I've spoilt your day.

1572
01:36:51,427 --> 01:36:53,285
Why spoilt?

1573
01:36:54,311 --> 01:36:56,167
You had so much work.

1574
01:37:01,298 --> 01:37:02,893
How long will you be here?

1575
01:37:05,206 --> 01:37:06,736
There'll be work...

1576
01:37:09,694 --> 01:37:11,551
...but at least I saw you...

1577
01:37:11,615 --> 01:37:13,474
...We talked...

1578
01:37:13,636 --> 01:37:15,395
...lt was nice.

1579
01:37:23,248 --> 01:37:25,008
What did you name your company?

1580
01:37:31,807 --> 01:37:33,662
Rajni productions.

1581
01:37:33,728 --> 01:37:35,588
Who's 'rajni'?

1582
01:37:36,614 --> 01:37:38,468
No one.

1583
01:37:38,630 --> 01:37:42,313
That old TV serial... remember?

1584
01:37:43,662 --> 01:37:45,193
Oh!

1585
01:37:47,699 --> 01:37:49,043
But the numerologist said

1586
01:37:49,110 --> 01:37:50,968
to change it.

1587
01:37:51,996 --> 01:37:54,170
He said 5 letters were unlucky.
Has to be 6.

1588
01:37:54,334 --> 01:37:57,687
I'm wondering whether I'd
spell it with a double 'E'.

1589
01:37:59,685 --> 01:38:03,783
Call it Neerja then. My proper name.

1590
01:38:04,491 --> 01:38:09,738
That's... N, e, e, r,
j, a... 6 letters

1591
01:38:10,775 --> 01:38:12,117
One way or the other,

1592
01:38:13,144 --> 01:38:15,001
I'll still be your partner.

1593
01:38:20,195 --> 01:38:21,724
That's not a bad idea.

1594
01:38:24,682 --> 01:38:27,502
I'm just joking.

1595
01:38:28,782 --> 01:38:32,049
But do listen to the numerologist.

1596
01:38:32,886 --> 01:38:35,824
We're also having Feng Shui
done for our new flat.

1597
01:38:37,276 --> 01:38:39,036
New flat?

1598
01:38:39,136 --> 01:38:41,209
Yes, the company's.

1599
01:38:42,885 --> 01:38:45,254
We'll probably shift in a few days.

1600
01:38:47,242 --> 01:38:51,789
You mean, if I came after
a couple of days

1601
01:38:53,460 --> 01:38:55,317
I wouldn't have found you here?

1602
01:38:57,307 --> 01:38:59,162
perhaps not.

1603
01:39:00,446 --> 01:39:03,517
But he's also trying...

1604
01:39:04,997 --> 01:39:09,410
Shifting all alone
will be difficult.

1605
01:39:12,687 --> 01:39:14,547
It's a very big flat...

1606
01:39:15,573 --> 01:39:17,430
...on the 7th floor...

1607
01:39:18,904 --> 01:39:21,011
...3,500 square feet...

1608
01:39:22,619 --> 01:39:24,149
...Four large bedrooms...

1609
01:39:26,148 --> 01:39:28,966
...drawing room... South facing...

1610
01:39:31,915 --> 01:39:33,774
There I'll do up the drawing
room beautifully.

1611
01:39:35,375 --> 01:39:39,211
Don't worry. They have
security downstairs.

1612
01:39:41,465 --> 01:39:44,602
Strangers just can't ring
the bell like that.

1613
01:39:48,196 --> 01:39:50,051
What's the address?

1614
01:39:51,076 --> 01:39:52,289
I don't know yet.

1615
01:39:52,486 --> 01:39:55,492
It's a company flat,
the office knows.

1616
01:39:56,847 --> 01:39:58,705
You have a phone at least.

1617
01:39:58,866 --> 01:40:01,259
That will be up in 24 hours.

1618
01:40:05,051 --> 01:40:08,950
Then how will I find you?

1619
01:40:12,228 --> 01:40:14,086
Give me your mobile number.

1620
01:40:14,248 --> 01:40:16,006
I'll call you.

1621
01:40:20,017 --> 01:40:23,251
I don't remember the number.

1622
01:40:24,727 --> 01:40:28,179
How come? It's your mobile,

1623
01:40:28,572 --> 01:40:30,429
you don't know your number?

1624
01:40:32,035 --> 01:40:35,170
Or you don't want to give it to me?

1625
01:40:40,045 --> 01:40:41,902
Actually it stays with my secretary.

1626
01:40:44,851 --> 01:40:47,025
But I'll find your house.

1627
01:40:52,158 --> 01:40:53,753
Have you thought of any
story for the TV serial?

1628
01:40:55,685 --> 01:40:57,790
They're thinking about it.

1629
01:40:58,310 --> 01:41:00,168
There's one idea they're working on.

1630
01:41:01,196 --> 01:41:03,053
please... not another serial,

1631
01:41:03,118 --> 01:41:05,293
about a quarrel between mother
in law and daughter in law.

1632
01:41:07,413 --> 01:41:11,379
No, it's about two business tycoons.

1633
01:41:11,772 --> 01:41:13,629
That's also stale.

1634
01:41:14,014 --> 01:41:15,542
No one will watch.

1635
01:41:16,193 --> 01:41:17,472
Tell me, what serial would you like?

1636
01:41:20,422 --> 01:41:23,558
A serial about girls like me.

1637
01:41:25,230 --> 01:41:27,088
Meaning?

1638
01:41:27,410 --> 01:41:31,440
...a village girl comes to
a new town after marriage...

1639
01:41:31,992 --> 01:41:33,750
...with a dream that...

1640
01:41:33,818 --> 01:41:38,234
...she'll love her husband
very much...

1641
01:41:39,908 --> 01:41:41,437
...look after him...

1642
01:41:42,793 --> 01:41:44,967
...But he's always on tour...

1643
01:41:46,317 --> 01:41:49,136
...She's always waiting...

1644
01:41:51,123 --> 01:41:53,944
Suddenly waking up from
sleep, thinking...

1645
01:41:54,584 --> 01:41:55,862
'did the doorbell ring? '

1646
01:41:57,853 --> 01:41:59,712
And then one day the bell rings,

1647
01:42:01,699 --> 01:42:03,556
she opens the door and sees

1648
01:42:04,838 --> 01:42:07,876
it's not her husband, someone else.

1649
01:42:09,390 --> 01:42:11,249
Someone she used to know

1650
01:42:14,452 --> 01:42:16,048
But can't recognise him anymore.

1651
01:42:17,179 --> 01:42:19,899
He's dark. His hair is thinning.

1652
01:42:25,285 --> 01:42:30,081
Will you make up the whole
story sitting here?

1653
01:42:31,438 --> 01:42:34,575
Then why do you pay people to do it?

1654
01:42:36,246 --> 01:42:39,063
I'd like to wash. Your bathroom?
- Why are you getting up?

1655
01:42:39,223 --> 01:42:40,982
To wash my hands.

1656
01:42:41,308 --> 01:42:42,903
Haven't you seen in big restaurants
they've ways to wash hands...

1657
01:42:42,973 --> 01:42:44,833
...at the table itself.

1658
01:43:13,739 --> 01:43:15,914
Here, finger bowl.

1659
01:43:18,546 --> 01:43:21,846
You like big restaurants?

1660
01:43:22,391 --> 01:43:24,249
Can't go anymore...

1661
01:43:24,314 --> 01:43:27,132
Now after going to the dietician...

1662
01:43:29,056 --> 01:43:31,874
Oh no! Don't you have a hanky?

1663
01:43:31,941 --> 01:43:34,760
You don't wipe your hands
on a sofa cover.

1664
01:43:34,824 --> 01:43:37,643
You're a real country
bumpkin, Mannu.

1665
01:43:38,767 --> 01:43:41,160
Sorry. Get it washed.

1666
01:43:50,207 --> 01:43:52,382
How was the meeting?
- Good.

1667
01:43:53,091 --> 01:43:55,267
Are you getting it?
- Looks like.

1668
01:43:55,977 --> 01:43:57,834
There were a couple of others.

1669
01:43:58,860 --> 01:44:01,098
Inside information is that

1670
01:44:01,230 --> 01:44:02,639
our program content
is very strong.

1671
01:44:03,664 --> 01:44:05,524
Now it's up to marketing.

1672
01:44:05,590 --> 01:44:06,802
Is Manoj back?

1673
01:44:06,872 --> 01:44:08,915
Yes, long time.

1674
01:44:09,436 --> 01:44:12,570
Where is he?
- In his room.

1675
01:44:13,280 --> 01:44:15,139
Call him.

1676
01:44:15,203 --> 01:44:17,442
Change. Freshen up. I'll call him.

1677
01:44:18,087 --> 01:44:19,945
Meanwhile, chat to him.

1678
01:44:20,106 --> 01:44:21,864
Must be getting bored alone?

1679
01:44:22,894 --> 01:44:24,752
He's depressed.

1680
01:44:26,771 --> 01:44:29,045
Why? The others didn't work?

1681
01:44:30,522 --> 01:44:31,735
Others?

1682
01:44:31,804 --> 01:44:34,938
I called prakash. He had been there.

1683
01:44:35,423 --> 01:44:37,182
He went to Balraj too.

1684
01:44:38,212 --> 01:44:40,385
Didn't get anything?

1685
01:44:41,096 --> 01:44:43,915
That he did.

1686
01:44:44,942 --> 01:44:46,800
Then?

1687
01:44:47,925 --> 01:44:49,680
Was he rude?

1688
01:44:50,709 --> 01:44:55,768
On the way back, don't
scream please,

1689
01:44:56,480 --> 01:44:58,335
the money got pickpocketed.

1690
01:44:59,362 --> 01:45:01,222
What!

1691
01:45:02,505 --> 01:45:04,099
My God! Full 12 thousand!

1692
01:45:04,266 --> 01:45:06,023
No

1693
01:45:07,308 --> 01:45:09,419
Ma'am only said that to protect me.

1694
01:45:12,821 --> 01:45:14,680
Meaning?

1695
01:45:34,967 --> 01:45:36,726
Yes it's open.

1696
01:45:40,252 --> 01:45:42,493
Sorry! Were you asleep?

1697
01:45:42,657 --> 01:45:44,416
No, please come.

1698
01:45:45,444 --> 01:45:48,582
I forgot to keep your water.

1699
01:45:50,573 --> 01:45:52,102
Didn't you switch on the ac?

1700
01:45:52,177 --> 01:45:54,417
It's okay. I prefer the fan.

1701
01:45:56,596 --> 01:45:57,874
Tell me one thing

1702
01:45:59,001 --> 01:46:01,721
am I just your friend's wife

1703
01:46:01,788 --> 01:46:04,128
or do you consider me your friend?

1704
01:46:04,673 --> 01:46:06,684
Why?
- Tell me.

1705
01:46:08,776 --> 01:46:10,372
Of course

1706
01:46:11,404 --> 01:46:13,772
Then shall I say something?
- Certainly

1707
01:46:15,248 --> 01:46:17,106
Wait an hour.

1708
01:46:18,133 --> 01:46:19,990
If you still can't sleep,

1709
01:46:23,197 --> 01:46:24,725
Take this

1710
01:46:25,759 --> 01:46:27,618
I won't need it.

1711
01:46:27,683 --> 01:46:30,502
It's good if you don't.

1712
01:46:30,566 --> 01:46:32,424
I don't want that either.

1713
01:46:33,451 --> 01:46:35,310
But, just in case...

1714
01:46:35,374 --> 01:46:37,383
You keep sleeping tablets too?

1715
01:46:39,315 --> 01:46:41,074
Two tips in a day.

1716
01:46:41,719 --> 01:46:45,617
Cry with the shower on
and sleeping pills.

1717
01:46:47,967 --> 01:46:52,163
Have you ever met
him after marriage?

1718
01:47:01,332 --> 01:47:03,187
Shall I say something

1719
01:47:03,573 --> 01:47:05,102
you'll feel better...

1720
01:47:09,022 --> 01:47:11,514
Her husband must be back by now

1721
01:47:17,227 --> 01:47:19,531
She'll be busy with him now.

1722
01:47:21,070 --> 01:47:26,896
She won't be thinking about you.

1723
01:47:29,211 --> 01:47:31,069
You're very practical.

1724
01:47:31,229 --> 01:47:32,989
Women have to be.

1725
01:47:33,571 --> 01:47:36,191
Oh! Your raincoat?

1726
01:47:36,902 --> 01:47:38,760
In the bathroom.

1727
01:47:38,921 --> 01:47:40,035
Yes.

1728
01:47:40,108 --> 01:47:42,600
Govind has to get the milk tomorrow.

1729
01:47:43,631 --> 01:47:45,489
In case it rains.

1730
01:47:45,556 --> 01:47:49,008
There's a letter in the pocket.
Give it to alok.

1731
01:47:49,496 --> 01:47:51,255
Okay, good night.

1732
01:47:51,324 --> 01:47:53,180
Good night.

1733
01:48:27,791 --> 01:48:30,926
Sorry again...

1734
01:48:31,637 --> 01:48:34,126
This was in the raincoat pocket.

1735
01:48:34,521 --> 01:48:36,378
What?

1736
01:48:37,404 --> 01:48:39,263
Here.

1737
01:48:39,423 --> 01:48:42,658
Still leaving things here and there.

1738
01:48:45,417 --> 01:48:48,553
Good night. - Good night.

1739
01:49:34,319 --> 01:49:36,875
It was God's will, Mannu

1740
01:49:37,042 --> 01:49:39,119
that you brought the raincoat.

1741
01:49:39,287 --> 01:49:41,678
Otherwise, I wouldn't have worn it

1742
01:49:41,754 --> 01:49:44,245
and wouldn't have read the letter.

1743
01:49:45,599 --> 01:49:47,455
You needed money so desperately

1744
01:49:47,619 --> 01:49:49,693
and didn't even tell me once?

1745
01:49:50,726 --> 01:49:52,254
Actually, when my husband
went on tour,

1746
01:49:52,329 --> 01:49:55,465
he took the keys with
him by mistake.

1747
01:49:56,174 --> 01:49:58,033
Or else, why should you have to go

1748
01:49:58,098 --> 01:50:00,916
from door to door just
for 30/40 thousand?

1749
01:50:03,226 --> 01:50:06,360
I don't have any petty cash at home.

1750
01:50:06,749 --> 01:50:09,568
That's why, I'm giving
you my jewellery.

1751
01:50:11,492 --> 01:50:14,312
please don't say no, Mannu.

1752
01:50:15,595 --> 01:50:17,191
If God had willed it,

1753
01:50:18,224 --> 01:50:21,357
We would've got married...

1754
01:50:23,991 --> 01:50:27,125
Would you still have hesitated
to take my jewellery?

1755
01:50:28,798 --> 01:50:30,657
Yours Niru
