1
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:04,011
Everyone forced me to contest..

2
00:03:04,117 --> 00:03:05,846
..I did, won the elections
and have become a minister.

3
00:03:05,952 --> 00:03:07,147
Other than that, I don't know much.

4
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:09,178
I want to do something!

5
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:13,817
I would know only from
counsel of IAS officers like you.

6
00:03:13,894 --> 00:03:16,727
Sir, we may have a lot of ideas,
but without support from..

7
00:03:16,797 --> 00:03:18,663
..People like you,
we won't be able to do anything!

8
00:03:18,732 --> 00:03:22,168
Whoever is involved
in the mining scam..

9
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:25,296
..I want to know the names
of the wrongdoers! - Yes, sir.

10
00:03:25,338 --> 00:03:26,999
Start your inquiry
in such a way that..

11
00:03:27,074 --> 00:03:28,564
..It'll deter the
recurrence of such wrongs!

12
00:03:28,642 --> 00:03:29,632
Sure!

13
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,311
- What is your name, sir?
- Rahul Sharma!

14
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:44,752
Mr. Sharma! What is your problem!

15
00:03:44,825 --> 00:03:47,055
People like you looting
the country is my problem!

16
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,822
In the guise of coal ore,
are you guys not smuggling diamond?

17
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:53,355
Mr. Sharma! Coal contains carbon!

18
00:03:53,667 --> 00:03:54,896
Diamonds too contain carbon!

19
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:58,168
Because we are selling
them because women like diamonds!

20
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,763
Otherwise why do we need it.

21
00:04:00,173 --> 00:04:01,732
You too have wife

22
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:04,343
She too wants diamonds.
Listen to me.

23
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:05,845
Never!

24
00:04:06,113 --> 00:04:08,241
Give the phone to the
guy standing next to you!

25
00:04:10,617 --> 00:04:12,608
Hail God of evil!

26
00:04:14,788 --> 00:04:16,722
Sir! Tell us, sir!

27
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:18,724
What is this?
Have all of you come here?

28
00:04:18,792 --> 00:04:21,853
What have you got to
say about the high tech scam?

29
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:24,192
What is your share in that?
How many of you are there?

30
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,358
It is true there was
corruption in the deal!

31
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:28,392
But I have nothing to do with that!

32
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:30,897
- That is why I am still a minister!
- Not that, sir!

33
00:04:30,971 --> 00:04:34,202
- We hear about lakhs and crores! -
Who is that? Come here!

34
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:35,241
Come!

35
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:37,902
Lakhs and crores!

36
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:41,073
How could you say that so casually?

37
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:44,149
How could you talk about
money like a video game score?

38
00:04:44,217 --> 00:04:46,208
Without knowing the facts,
please don't talk like that!

39
00:04:46,253 --> 00:04:48,620
- No, sir! - Let me finish!

40
00:04:48,989 --> 00:04:52,391
My daughter is on a tour!
Let me talk to her for two minutes!

41
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:54,887
After that I will
answer all your queries!

42
00:04:54,928 --> 00:04:55,827
Please move a little!

43
00:04:55,896 --> 00:04:56,954
Sir, answer this before you go!

44
00:04:57,063 --> 00:04:58,394
If the minister's
daughter is going on..

45
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:00,229
..A tour within 24
hours of the news about.

46
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,768
..The scam breaking out,
where she is going..

47
00:05:01,835 --> 00:05:03,303
..And the reason behind
it is very evident!

48
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:06,095
Don't hazard guesses!

49
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:10,240
You talk as though I am sending
crores of rupees through my daughter!

50
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:13,904
She is going for higher studies!
Deplorablei

51
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:43,009
- Daddy! - What is it, dear?

52
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:44,270
- What is all this? -
Have you seen this?

53
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:47,211
No more suitcases are
available to pack her dresses!

54
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,272
- This is the eighth suitcase! -
Why so many suitcases?

55
00:05:50,317 --> 00:05:51,443
They will say it is all cash!

56
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:54,950
- Why do you want so many dresses? -
Daddy, don't say no to me!

57
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:57,319
I am the daughter of
a central minister! - My God!

58
00:05:57,457 --> 00:05:59,949
You can even consider it my ego!

59
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,288
That is why I am packing all these!

60
00:06:03,797 --> 00:06:05,959
You are going to do PG in psychology!

61
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:09,297
I don't know why you need
to take all these dolls with you!

62
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:13,465
Daddy, children find
everything surprising.

63
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:17,405
Their desires are more.
They have more ideas too.

64
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:20,506
Do you know how much
energy it gives us?

65
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:23,248
Give me a kiss!

66
00:06:27,854 --> 00:06:29,845
- Best of luck, dear! -
I love you, dad!

67
00:08:37,117 --> 00:08:38,482
Ola!

68
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:43,283
Hi.. Akansha! India.

69
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:45,188
Nice house! -Welcome!

70
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:46,520
Yes, coming.

71
00:09:03,176 --> 00:09:04,234
So silly!

72
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,487
Hello, ma'am

73
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,097
There is a box,
carton box under the bed!

74
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:26,496
- Is it yours? - No!

75
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:29,500
Must belong to the previous tenant's!

76
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:32,366
Just leave it there! Don't worry!

77
00:09:32,439 --> 00:09:34,908
Mummy! I have reached safely!

78
00:09:35,675 --> 00:09:39,612
I have just come to the room!
Everything is fantastic!

79
00:09:39,946 --> 00:09:41,175
Mummy, wait for a minute, please!

80
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:42,681
The thing is..

81
00:09:42,715 --> 00:09:46,083
..The previous tenant
has left a carton here!

82
00:09:46,186 --> 00:09:49,281
I don't know whether they
forgot to take it or discarded it.

83
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:52,381
What is inside? Don't they want it?

84
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:54,423
Will it be useful to us?

85
00:09:56,463 --> 00:09:59,524
Only after I open the box
and find out, will I be peaceful.

86
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,540
Does it belong to a guy or a girl?

87
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:18,574
Girl's only.

88
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:20,944
Nice color!

89
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:36,101
She is beautiful! What is her name?

90
00:10:42,442 --> 00:10:44,774
Her name is Komali!

91
00:10:45,411 --> 00:10:48,472
Her name and photo are very fine!

92
00:10:48,615 --> 00:10:50,083
Komali!

93
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,778
What is inside your golden box?

94
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:02,087
Diary!

95
00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:05,754
Is this diary yours?

96
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:08,665
Is it personal?

97
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:10,759
Should no one read it?

98
00:11:12,105 --> 00:11:14,301
Then I will start
reading it right now!

99
00:11:14,374 --> 00:11:17,139
Can you stop me?

100
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:27,211
With dad's permission,
I came to Europe to learn music.'

101
00:11:27,287 --> 00:11:29,051
'I feel this is a great achievement.'

102
00:11:29,322 --> 00:11:31,290
'I like this Europe very much!'

103
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:35,151
'Fourth Avenue, 594 is my room!'

104
00:11:58,351 --> 00:12:01,252
The balcony view from
the right side is scenic!

105
00:12:01,487 --> 00:12:03,581
Really! I want to see!

106
00:12:07,427 --> 00:12:11,660
Wow! My God! Awesome!

107
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:16,360
Really beautiful!

108
00:12:19,872 --> 00:12:21,601
As soon as I arrived, I called mom!

109
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:25,167
- Dear, have you reached safely? -
Yes, reached, mom!

110
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:28,180
I heard you get
good vegetables there!

111
00:12:28,214 --> 00:12:29,841
Get some, cook for yourself and eat!

112
00:12:29,882 --> 00:12:32,408
Don't have food from the hotel!
Your stomach might get upset!

113
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:34,782
Don't ever go for pizza or burger.

114
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:37,079
Dear, take care of the violin!

115
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:40,185
Did you take it as cabin
baggage or as luggage?

116
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,888
- Don't damage it - No issues, dad!

117
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:44,597
I was keeping it in the bag with me!

118
00:12:44,697 --> 00:12:46,597
Take care of it. It belongs
to your great grandpa's period!

119
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:48,861
First it was your great grandpa's,
then my dad's, then me..

120
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:50,733
..And in the future,
you have to play it in concerts!

121
00:12:50,803 --> 00:12:53,204
It is the Goddess of learning
and Goddess of wealth for us!

122
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:55,230
Hello! It seems the
lamp wick is burning up.

123
00:12:55,308 --> 00:12:56,366
One minute!

124
00:12:56,409 --> 00:12:57,604
Let all propitious grace be showered.

125
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,701
Dear, he would say so many things!

126
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,543
You don't pay heed
to all those sermons.

127
00:13:01,581 --> 00:13:03,709
I am fed up with
him playing the fiddle!

128
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,774
From the day I was married to him..

129
00:13:05,885 --> 00:13:08,911
..Till the time you were born, this
man was playing violin all the time.

130
00:13:09,222 --> 00:13:11,384
Even at the hospital,
he kept on playing the violin!

131
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:14,816
You leave that aside and
learn some other good instrument!

132
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:18,454
Other than that,
any other instrument is good enough!

133
00:13:19,832 --> 00:13:22,233
'Today is the first
day of my college life!'

134
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:24,430
'I was going to college
with the violin that dad gave me.'

135
00:13:24,504 --> 00:13:27,474
'It was my bad luck
that I saw him then!'

136
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:31,472
'What happened was
totally unexpected!'

137
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,832
Wait. Wait. No! No!

138
00:15:23,456 --> 00:15:25,515
Wait, wait. No!

139
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:27,024
My God!

140
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:44,538
Take care! - Yes. Yes.

141
00:15:46,646 --> 00:15:50,810
'The violin of my great
grandpa was shattered to pieces!'

142
00:15:50,983 --> 00:15:54,442
'How will I inform
my dad about this?'

143
00:15:58,491 --> 00:16:00,721
All men are the same!

144
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:04,291
They will do only what
we expect them not to do!

145
00:16:04,497 --> 00:16:06,056
If we want them
not to touch a thing"

146
00:16:06,098 --> 00:16:07,566
..they will touch only that.

147
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:10,668
However careful you are,
you will be out cleanly!

148
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:13,398
The minds of boys
are always like this!

149
00:16:22,615 --> 00:16:24,982
The name is nice! Sanju!

150
00:16:25,084 --> 00:16:27,416
A guy doing a bad thing
for the sake of a good thing..

151
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:30,081
..Is he a good boy or a bad boy?

152
00:17:09,795 --> 00:17:14,631
"Seetha seetha! Geetha geetha!"

153
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,067
"Seetha, Geetha, Radha, Maya!"

154
00:17:17,136 --> 00:17:19,366
"Whatever is your name.."

155
00:17:19,472 --> 00:17:21,839
"Whatever is your country.."

156
00:17:21,908 --> 00:17:24,536
"if girls don't exist in earth.."

157
00:17:24,644 --> 00:17:28,638
"Life becomes boring. Life is zero!"

158
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:34,149
"Jeans, tops, shirt or skirt.."

159
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:36,515
"..whatever dress you wear.."

160
00:17:36,589 --> 00:17:38,751
"..it should capture the eyes!"

161
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:43,557
"Don't wait for the
fashion to change!"

162
00:17:43,663 --> 00:17:46,155
"Start a new trend today!"

163
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:53,730
"We should climb to
the top through the ladder!"

164
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:55,898
"We should run along with the nation,
run fast."

165
00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:58,841
"So run, run, run, run, run, run."

166
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:01,937
"Put your hands up and
say let's have some fun."

167
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:08,517
"Run, run, run, run, run!"

168
00:18:08,721 --> 00:18:11,691
"Got to win the heart
of every sexy woman!"

169
00:18:50,262 --> 00:18:52,754
"if your tongue has the
cocktail taste forever.."

170
00:18:52,832 --> 00:18:55,164
"..if there's a scent within you.."

171
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:57,669
"Top to bottom, I am with you.."

172
00:18:57,737 --> 00:19:00,798
"..like a bee flying
to taste the honey!"

173
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:04,940
"if your heart is soft
like a cotton lint.."

174
00:19:05,011 --> 00:19:07,571
"if your glances are
sharp like a needle.."

175
00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:09,911
"..there is no dearth for anything!"

176
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:13,077
"Spreading the net,
young girls would line up!"

177
00:19:16,956 --> 00:19:19,482
"No point in being an
onlooker with folded hands!"

178
00:19:19,592 --> 00:19:21,788
"Like a bullet from the gun,
we should dart out!"

179
00:19:21,861 --> 00:19:24,626
"So run, run, run, run, run, run."

180
00:19:24,697 --> 00:19:27,997
"Put your hands up and
say let's have some fun."

181
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:34,496
"Run, run, run, run, run!"

182
00:19:34,607 --> 00:19:37,542
"Got to win the heart
of every sexy woman!"

183
00:20:25,925 --> 00:20:28,257
"Like a kerchief
soaked in chloroform.."

184
00:20:28,327 --> 00:20:30,819
"..the attires of these
girls are a high danger!"

185
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:33,194
"Like an organic foam mattress.."

186
00:20:33,265 --> 00:20:36,565
"..we need them to adjust to nature!"

187
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:40,696
"Six packs do not suit everyone!"

188
00:20:40,773 --> 00:20:43,037
"Girls don't look for them!"

189
00:20:43,109 --> 00:20:45,373
"Hey, girl, if you wear Salwar.."

190
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:48,342
"..there is no one
to surpass your beauty!"

191
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:55,221
"if you underestimate,
you always lose!"

192
00:20:55,287 --> 00:20:57,688
"if you don't enjoy this life,
it is difficult!"

193
00:20:57,723 --> 00:21:00,192
"So, run, run, run, run, run, run."

194
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:03,354
"Put your hands up and
say let's have some fun."

195
00:21:40,232 --> 00:21:43,793
- Are you the new
girl in that room? - Yes!

196
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:47,332
Name?

197
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:49,738
- Akansha. - Sanju!

198
00:21:50,276 --> 00:21:52,244
I know it.

199
00:21:52,278 --> 00:21:54,838
How does he know I
am staying in that room?

200
00:21:54,914 --> 00:21:58,646
He talks as if he doesn't know
the girl who stayed there earlier!

201
00:21:59,418 --> 00:22:02,945
But he doesn't look
like a guy of that sort.

202
00:22:03,088 --> 00:22:07,457
Since her diary had his photo,
I could recognize him!

203
00:22:09,295 --> 00:22:10,854
Let me check the diary now itself!

204
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:12,762
I can attend college later.

205
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:28,712
- Excuse me! - Yes!

206
00:22:32,952 --> 00:22:33,885
New Joinee!

207
00:22:33,953 --> 00:22:35,978
Miss Komali Shankarabaranam!

208
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:38,780
- I want to meet Mr. Brahmma! -
Which Brahmma?

209
00:22:38,824 --> 00:22:40,986
- Fiddle Brahmma! - Fiddle Brahmma?

210
00:22:41,293 --> 00:22:43,489
Go inside! He is playing!

211
00:23:12,424 --> 00:23:13,823
Stop!

212
00:23:14,026 --> 00:23:16,825
Granddaughter of
Pendyala Shankarabaranam!

213
00:23:16,996 --> 00:23:19,431
Daughter of Pingelli Shankarabaranam!

214
00:23:19,999 --> 00:23:21,194
Komali Shankarabaranam!

215
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:22,767
Bless me, master!

216
00:23:22,868 --> 00:23:24,859
Stay like that for
some more time, dear!

217
00:23:25,004 --> 00:23:28,065
Look, all western
people should learn this!

218
00:23:28,774 --> 00:23:32,836
I was longing for this
revered touch for 10 years, dear!

219
00:23:33,345 --> 00:23:36,042
'Physical harassment'
These people call this

220
00:23:36,115 --> 00:23:38,550
The girl sitting in front
even lodged a complaint!

221
00:23:38,884 --> 00:23:40,374
Learn, learn this!

222
00:23:40,853 --> 00:23:42,844
Music starts from
the feet of the teacher!

223
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:44,890
Do you know that? You should know it!

224
00:23:45,024 --> 00:23:46,355
You..

225
00:23:47,192 --> 00:23:51,857
Your great grandpa taught
music to many stalwarts!

226
00:23:52,131 --> 00:23:55,294
I want to see that priceless
fiddle of that great musician!

227
00:23:55,467 --> 00:23:58,528
Please permit me to see it.
I want to touch it!

228
00:23:58,904 --> 00:24:00,770
I want to feel it!

229
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:03,241
That fiddle can never be seen again!

230
00:24:03,409 --> 00:24:04,535
What happened, dear?

231
00:24:04,576 --> 00:24:06,203
- It's gone! - Where has it gone?

232
00:24:06,245 --> 00:24:08,304
Nowhere, master! It is broken!

233
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:10,906
You mean broken! How?

234
00:24:14,887 --> 00:24:15,945
Whatever may be the problem ..

235
00:24:16,055 --> 00:24:17,989
..Your dad should never
come to know about this!

236
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:20,058
Then not merely the fiddle,
you will lose your dad too!

237
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,115
You are right, master!

238
00:24:21,327 --> 00:24:24,456
Leave it!
Was your fiddle broken by Sanju?

239
00:24:25,564 --> 00:24:27,259
- Who is Sanju? - He is a loafer!

240
00:24:27,333 --> 00:24:28,266
With a marked hairstyle..

241
00:24:28,334 --> 00:24:30,325
..Not lanky,
at the same time, not too short..

242
00:24:30,402 --> 00:24:31,801
..A medium stature guy.

243
00:24:31,904 --> 00:24:33,133
Might look like a guy
who had six pack abs earlier..

244
00:24:33,238 --> 00:24:34,569
..But doesn't have one now.
Is he the guy?

245
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:36,969
Yes, master. He is the guy!

246
00:24:37,242 --> 00:24:40,974
I know about his monkey pranks!

247
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:45,014
If I get a chance to talk to God..

248
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:47,617
..My first question to Him would be..

249
00:24:47,853 --> 00:24:50,117
..Why He allowed an
idiot like him to be born.

250
00:24:50,589 --> 00:24:53,081
He is a fungus that affects music!

251
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:57,318
He has a band and a
few donkey groups to sing!

252
00:24:58,097 --> 00:24:59,587
I will tell you where they are!

253
00:24:59,631 --> 00:25:01,292
Go and get your fiddle!

254
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,500
If you come back without the fiddle..

255
00:25:03,836 --> 00:25:07,204
..I will peel and put you in.. Go.

256
00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:36,134
Thank you! Thank you!

257
00:25:37,636 --> 00:25:38,728
Are you a Telugu girl?

258
00:25:46,979 --> 00:25:49,880
My God, seems to be a dumb girl.
Poor girl!

259
00:25:49,982 --> 00:25:52,246
No, there is nothing wrong with me!

260
00:25:53,185 --> 00:25:56,712
Can you talk?
- Then why did you mime?

261
00:25:57,256 --> 00:25:59,088
Yesterday during that incident"

262
00:25:59,258 --> 00:26:02,250
..didn't you break a fiddle?
That is my great grandpa's.

263
00:26:02,661 --> 00:26:04,060
When did I break a fiddle?

264
00:26:05,097 --> 00:26:06,360
Yesterday you chased a white man..

265
00:26:06,598 --> 00:26:08,692
..Hit him and broke his head.
Don't you remember that?

266
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:10,665
Then did you not hear
the breaking sound of a wood?

267
00:26:10,836 --> 00:26:13,328
- Yes! - That wood was mine!

268
00:26:13,672 --> 00:26:16,232
That wasn't an ordinary wood!
It was our family food!

269
00:26:18,177 --> 00:26:20,168
I am sorry!

270
00:26:21,213 --> 00:26:22,578
Now you can't get back what is gone!

271
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:25,909
If you don't have any issues,
can I get you a new one?

272
00:26:26,051 --> 00:26:29,180
- Oh, thank you, sir!-
You are welcome, ma'am!

273
00:26:29,354 --> 00:26:31,948
You are not as bad
as I heard about you!

274
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:36,789
- To me you look polite! -
Who said we are bad?

275
00:26:37,029 --> 00:26:39,589
- My master said so.. -
Whom do you mean?

276
00:26:39,698 --> 00:26:41,723
Our professor Fiddle Brahmma!

277
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,929
Are you the student of Brahmma?

278
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:48,900
- What's your name, dear? - Komali!

279
00:26:48,974 --> 00:26:52,376
- Why did you come here? -
To learn music!

280
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:55,706
What will that fool teach you?
He evokes boredom!

281
00:26:55,881 --> 00:26:57,872
Don't talk ill of my master!

282
00:26:57,916 --> 00:26:59,884
- Return my fiddle! -
I wanted to return.

283
00:26:59,952 --> 00:27:01,147
But since you mentioned his name..

284
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:02,915
..Now there's no chance
of you getting it back!

285
00:27:02,988 --> 00:27:04,615
I will complain about
this to my master!

286
00:27:07,926 --> 00:27:13,160
- Are you our enemy? -
My God! It's nothing of that sort.

287
00:27:13,398 --> 00:27:14,661
- Then do one thing! - Tell me.

288
00:27:14,733 --> 00:27:16,792
Get on top of the music
college compound wall..

289
00:27:16,902 --> 00:27:18,097
..And shout Brahmma is..

290
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:20,070
..An International
waste in college and music.

291
00:27:20,339 --> 00:27:23,434
If you say that,
I will get you five fiddles!

292
00:27:24,076 --> 00:27:26,306
If I whisper,
will you get me one fiddle?

293
00:27:26,411 --> 00:27:28,903
If you whisper in his ears,
I will agree!

294
00:27:29,148 --> 00:27:30,741
My God, give me another option.

295
00:27:30,816 --> 00:27:33,012
There is an option.
You must go from here.

296
00:27:33,118 --> 00:27:34,643
I will count up to three.

297
00:27:34,753 --> 00:27:36,448
If you don't go before I count
to three, your case is finished!

298
00:27:36,688 --> 00:27:38,087
One.

299
00:27:38,357 --> 00:27:39,290
Two.

300
00:27:39,358 --> 00:27:40,416
Three.

301
00:27:40,459 --> 00:27:41,790
My God!

302
00:28:06,985 --> 00:28:08,009
Hi!

303
00:28:09,821 --> 00:28:10,481
Hi!

304
00:28:10,722 --> 00:28:14,056
- What are you doing here? -
I play guitar here!

305
00:28:14,226 --> 00:28:18,720
- Where is your band? -
What do you mean by that?

306
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:21,022
Where is your gang'?

307
00:28:22,301 --> 00:28:24,793
How do you know I have a gang?

308
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:27,505
I am a psychology student!

309
00:28:28,207 --> 00:28:29,504
If I scan for two seconds..

310
00:28:29,741 --> 00:28:32,802
..I will get 100 printouts about you!

311
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:38,376
Is psychology such a peachy thing?

312
00:28:38,817 --> 00:28:40,979
Is it possible to
know about everything?

313
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:42,316
Not everybody can do it!

314
00:28:42,487 --> 00:28:44,751
Only gifted personalities
like me know it!

315
00:28:44,923 --> 00:28:46,152
Is it?

316
00:28:46,325 --> 00:28:47,918
What do you know about me?

317
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:48,993
Tell me about me..

318
00:28:49,261 --> 00:28:50,854
..Whether I drink liquor or not.

319
00:28:50,929 --> 00:28:52,158
Whether I am a sadist or not.

320
00:28:52,197 --> 00:28:54,393
What is my profession?
Do I know music?

321
00:28:54,499 --> 00:28:56,160
Or am I simply carrying a guitar?

322
00:28:56,201 --> 00:28:59,000
Tell me! Play my cl)!

323
00:28:59,171 --> 00:29:01,902
Psychology is not about
telling known facts!

324
00:29:02,007 --> 00:29:04,169
It is about telling
what you don't know!

325
00:29:05,344 --> 00:29:07,438
Anyway, your time is good!

326
00:29:07,512 --> 00:29:10,004
I have not analyzed it so keenly!

327
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:13,215
Now I am going!

328
00:29:16,021 --> 00:29:18,183
I have escaped for the time being!

329
00:29:18,223 --> 00:29:20,851
If he had asked anything else,
I would have been trapped!

330
00:29:21,293 --> 00:29:23,022
Why should I be so hasty!

331
00:29:23,795 --> 00:29:26,025
I could have done it
after reading it fully!

332
00:29:36,808 --> 00:29:38,867
You loafers!

333
00:29:38,977 --> 00:29:41,207
Monkeys! You messy..

334
00:29:41,246 --> 00:29:44,216
Instead of trembling
at the sight of my student"

335
00:29:44,249 --> 00:29:45,444
..you guys have insulted her?

336
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:46,949
Was it not a despicable conduct?

337
00:29:47,052 --> 00:29:50,488
Because you guys are not sound in
mind, will you guys swallow an ember?

338
00:29:50,555 --> 00:29:53,388
For the sake of a trivial fiddle,
don't bark like this!

339
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:54,482
Whose fiddle is trivial?

340
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:56,926
If my fiddle is trivial,
what about yours?

341
00:29:56,995 --> 00:29:59,293
How about this guitar?
How about these drums?

342
00:29:59,398 --> 00:30:00,888
How about this worthless keyboard?

343
00:30:00,932 --> 00:30:02,559
I tell you,
these are loony instruments!

344
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:05,293
- Who are you to talk about them? -
What?

345
00:30:05,404 --> 00:30:07,065
Did you ask me who I am?

346
00:30:07,272 --> 00:30:12,403
Western music shrouded
our pure classical music's glow!

347
00:30:12,444 --> 00:30:15,141
I protected that glow with my hands,
like this..

348
00:30:15,247 --> 00:30:17,238
..I brought it up to Europe!

349
00:30:17,316 --> 00:30:19,284
Will you be able to blow it out?

350
00:30:20,085 --> 00:30:22,315
My God! He has blown it!
Didn't you see him blowing?

351
00:30:22,421 --> 00:30:25,413
He will never prosper. Never prosper!

352
00:30:26,091 --> 00:30:29,459
Seeing you guys, the Goddess of music
has walked out weeping many times!

353
00:30:29,528 --> 00:30:30,927
For the sake of you guys..

354
00:30:30,962 --> 00:30:32,361
..Many times I have fallen
at her feet and pleaded with her!

355
00:30:32,431 --> 00:30:35,093
I don't know how many
times more I may have to do it.

356
00:30:35,133 --> 00:30:38,103
You blare like a damaged speaker!

357
00:30:38,136 --> 00:30:41,162
That makes me doubt
your music credentials!

358
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,138
Are you saying I don't know music!

359
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:44,334
Music and I are synonyms!

360
00:30:44,443 --> 00:30:46,036
I am the music and music is me!

361
00:30:46,111 --> 00:30:47,272
Okay!

362
00:30:47,446 --> 00:30:49,278
Let us check who is great. You or we?

363
00:30:49,348 --> 00:30:51,646
- Okay, let's see! -
See that your string doesn't snap!

364
00:30:51,883 --> 00:30:54,853
Classical or western! We will
prove today as to which is great!

365
00:30:54,953 --> 00:30:56,512
- Ready? - Ready!

366
00:30:58,323 --> 00:31:04,228
"Now the music concert of
Sree Sree Ranga Ranga Rangacharula."

367
00:31:04,296 --> 00:31:07,129
"First beat.. from Poonakumba Raga."

368
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:18,634
"Good!"

369
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:47,232
"Come, let us immerse
in raga Shankarabaranam!"

370
00:31:47,339 --> 00:31:51,242
"As! relish raga Keeravani,
let me relish you!“

371
00:31:51,343 --> 00:31:54,608
"Let us become turbulent
like raga Ranjani!"

372
00:31:54,679 --> 00:31:58,707
"Let me scare you with raga Bairavi!"

373
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:02,045
"Let me torment you
with raga Hamsadwani!"

374
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:06,216
"Let me tie you with raga Hindolam!"

375
00:32:06,291 --> 00:32:09,921
"Shankara. Shankara!"

376
00:32:10,028 --> 00:32:13,225
"Come, let us immerse
in raga Shankarabaranam!"

377
00:32:13,298 --> 00:32:17,201
"As! relish raga Keeravani,
let me relish you!“

378
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:20,466
"Let us become turbulent
like raga Ranjani!"

379
00:32:20,539 --> 00:32:25,375
"Let me scare you with raga Bairavi!"

380
00:32:45,063 --> 00:32:47,964
"Do you want some music?"

381
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:51,232
"Do you want some music?"

382
00:32:52,237 --> 00:32:56,003
"Do you want fusion?
Do you want western?"

383
00:32:56,141 --> 00:32:59,736
"Do you want rousing beats?"

384
00:32:59,778 --> 00:33:03,271
"Will you count one,
two, three, four?"

385
00:33:03,348 --> 00:33:05,077
"Let us start the contest!"

386
00:33:05,116 --> 00:33:07,141
"if you are smart, clash with me!"

387
00:33:07,252 --> 00:33:09,653
"Do you want some music?"

388
00:33:10,755 --> 00:33:13,281
"Do you want some music?"

389
00:33:16,428 --> 00:33:20,092
"Singing the rhythmic syllables.."

390
00:33:20,165 --> 00:33:24,102
"..I can bathe you in molten wax!"

391
00:33:27,506 --> 00:33:31,101
"Playing notes, do re mi fa.."

392
00:33:31,276 --> 00:33:35,270
"..I can effuse your mind!"

393
00:33:38,283 --> 00:33:40,149
"Don't be obstinate, son!"

394
00:33:40,218 --> 00:33:42,050
"Go to Kasi, my son!"

395
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:45,522
"I can play sitar in your guitar!"

396
00:33:46,124 --> 00:33:49,617
"Shankara. Shankara!"

397
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:52,823
"Come, let us immerse
in raga Shankarabaranam!"

398
00:33:53,064 --> 00:33:57,626
"As! relish raga Keeravani,
let me relish you!“

399
00:34:10,081 --> 00:34:11,742
"Hip hop or hippopotamus!"

400
00:34:11,816 --> 00:34:14,080
"Place him in a cage!"

401
00:34:15,554 --> 00:34:19,252
"Disco, disco,
dance from left and right."

402
00:34:19,324 --> 00:34:21,418
"Can we give him the command?"

403
00:34:22,661 --> 00:34:24,720
"Life is rock and roll!"

404
00:34:24,829 --> 00:34:26,490
"We need self-control!"

405
00:34:26,565 --> 00:34:28,863
"Who lost the contest?"

406
00:34:30,335 --> 00:34:36,832
"Do you want some music?
Do you want some music?"

407
00:35:20,485 --> 00:35:22,647
Even as your lordship forgives us,
you have won!

408
00:35:22,721 --> 00:35:24,712
You are at a different
level from ours!

409
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:27,224
You guys are here
and I am like an ocean!

410
00:35:27,258 --> 00:35:28,783
What did you guys think of me?

411
00:35:28,893 --> 00:35:30,884
Within five minutes,
did I not make you guys tremble?

412
00:35:30,929 --> 00:35:32,556
If I were in my elements..

413
00:35:32,631 --> 00:35:36,124
..You guys would have been
washed away in my musical Tsunami!

414
00:35:36,334 --> 00:35:38,132
I made a mistake, master!
I am really, really..

415
00:35:38,236 --> 00:35:40,227
Move away! Why apologize?

416
00:35:40,271 --> 00:35:42,262
To a great musician like me..

417
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:44,274
..You guys don't even
deserve to say sorry.

418
00:35:44,342 --> 00:35:45,741
If you insist on saying sorry..

419
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:48,836
..Go to her, take her
hand and give her the fiddle..

420
00:35:48,913 --> 00:35:50,574
..And say sorry, 9°!

421
00:35:56,488 --> 00:35:58,582
I am sorry for disturbing you!

422
00:35:59,257 --> 00:36:02,522
For disturbing me, thanks!

423
00:36:03,795 --> 00:36:05,263
What?

424
00:36:06,531 --> 00:36:08,590
Why were you born so gorgeous?

425
00:36:08,967 --> 00:36:10,298
You were born in some other country!

426
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:13,167
Why did you come to
a country where I live?

427
00:36:13,271 --> 00:36:16,673
When there are so many people,
why did you meet me?

428
00:36:17,275 --> 00:36:20,711
If I don't get sleep at night,
can I make a call to you?

429
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,444
What is your number?

430
00:36:24,949 --> 00:36:29,443
If I feel like seeing you suddenly,
shouldn't I jump the walls?

431
00:36:30,388 --> 00:36:31,787
What is your address?

432
00:36:34,292 --> 00:36:37,353
My God! He is not an ordinary guy!

433
00:36:37,462 --> 00:36:40,397
If one praises a girl so much,
which girl would not fall for that?

434
00:36:40,465 --> 00:36:43,901
Anyway, he didn't say he
lost the competition for her sake.

435
00:36:44,969 --> 00:36:49,304
Do you know I lost it for your sake!

436
00:36:49,407 --> 00:36:50,465
My God!

437
00:36:50,675 --> 00:36:53,235
He is not like what we think of him!
He is a brainy guy!

438
00:37:02,353 --> 00:37:04,685
'My mind is now filled
solely by Sanju!'

439
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:07,248
'I want to meet him!'

440
00:37:07,859 --> 00:37:10,988
'Truly speaking,
I want to join his batch!'

441
00:37:11,029 --> 00:37:12,258
'I am craving for that!'

442
00:37:12,997 --> 00:37:15,989
Komali!

443
00:37:17,569 --> 00:37:21,506
If you lose control of your mind,
concentration will become confusion!

444
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:23,840
No confusion, master!

445
00:37:24,342 --> 00:37:26,674
- My concentration was
on the guitar! - What?

446
00:37:26,711 --> 00:37:30,272
- I would like to learn guitar! -
Do you want to learn guitar!

447
00:37:30,381 --> 00:37:31,871
I will whack you!

448
00:37:32,383 --> 00:37:33,942
Discarding the auspicious fiddle..

449
00:37:34,018 --> 00:37:36,350
..You are going to learn
that wretched guitar?

450
00:37:36,421 --> 00:37:37,445
Do you know who you are?

451
00:37:37,522 --> 00:37:39,581
Are you aware of your lineage?

452
00:37:39,858 --> 00:37:41,849
You are from the
Shankarabaranam family!

453
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:44,554
I have a lot of
expectations from you!

454
00:37:44,896 --> 00:37:47,365
To shatter western music,
I have a design.

455
00:37:47,432 --> 00:37:50,527
You are my missile
to accomplish that!

456
00:37:50,769 --> 00:37:53,534
I will not agree for that
even at the cost of my life!

457
00:37:54,372 --> 00:37:56,534
If you discard this and go to Sanju,
I will not keep you here.

458
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:58,303
Bear in mind my warning!

459
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:18,820
From Indian banks,
unaccounted money..

460
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:23,924
..Crores of rupees,
I mean millions of US dollars..

461
00:38:24,402 --> 00:38:26,393
..Are to be transferred to your bank!

462
00:38:27,071 --> 00:38:29,972
To transfer such a large sum..

463
00:38:30,408 --> 00:38:34,970
..Indian embassy will ask for
finance clearance from your embassy!

464
00:38:35,847 --> 00:38:38,680
My man has already gone there!

465
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:40,508
Explain to him!

466
00:38:56,935 --> 00:38:59,461
When I make a proposal to someone..

467
00:38:59,537 --> 00:39:01,938
..I don't like them saying 'no'.

468
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:03,838
I will give you 24 hours time!

469
00:39:04,375 --> 00:39:06,707
Fix a price and say yes!

470
00:39:24,829 --> 00:39:25,990
Get on.

471
00:39:26,698 --> 00:39:28,792
The master has told
me not to ride on your bike!

472
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,468
I say get on to the bike!

473
00:39:33,137 --> 00:39:34,627
Don't tell master!

474
00:39:38,877 --> 00:39:41,403
Where are we going? Tell me!

475
00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:46,647
- It won't happen! -
What is he saying?

476
00:39:46,718 --> 00:39:47,651
He is not agreeing!

477
00:39:47,685 --> 00:39:49,585
Do you know with
how much difficulty..

478
00:39:49,654 --> 00:39:51,918
..We brought that
much cash from India?

479
00:39:52,657 --> 00:39:54,819
Millions of dollars are wailing here.

480
00:39:55,593 --> 00:39:57,721
A single account is enough
to deposit that money in your bank.

481
00:39:57,829 --> 00:40:00,764
If you say it is impossible,
agree to it.

482
00:40:00,865 --> 00:40:01,991
- Tell me! - Keep quiet!

483
00:40:02,033 --> 00:40:03,432
Where are we going?

484
00:40:07,005 --> 00:40:09,167
Please tell me, Sanju!

485
00:40:09,941 --> 00:40:11,204
- Get down! - What happened?

486
00:40:11,442 --> 00:40:12,534
I said get down!

487
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:14,511
Why did you ask me to get down here?

488
00:40:14,545 --> 00:40:16,741
When I take you with
me with great love..

489
00:40:16,848 --> 00:40:18,111
..I don't like you asking
me questions like where and why!

490
00:40:18,182 --> 00:40:19,911
You stay here! Move!

491
00:40:23,521 --> 00:40:26,684
If you don't come back
within five minutes..

492
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:33,898
..Let you and the bike blast!

493
00:41:07,899 --> 00:41:11,062
Go and get the girl! Bring her to me!

494
00:41:11,102 --> 00:41:12,501
I want her!

495
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,571
Come, get on!

496
00:41:45,937 --> 00:41:46,665
Come!

497
00:41:46,771 --> 00:41:49,172
Let's go in to the woods and talk!

498
00:41:50,942 --> 00:41:54,606
If boys wish to take
me to the beach or woods..

499
00:41:54,779 --> 00:41:56,110
..I have been instructed
not to accompany them!

500
00:41:56,147 --> 00:41:57,546
- My mom said so. - Is it?

501
00:41:57,615 --> 00:41:59,140
Did my mom ask me
to take girls like this?

502
00:41:59,217 --> 00:42:00,116
Nothing will happen there!

503
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:01,515
Don't think only you have a mom!

504
00:42:01,619 --> 00:42:02,643
Come!

505
00:42:03,855 --> 00:42:05,118
Komali!

506
00:42:06,057 --> 00:42:09,118
I have been with a lot of girls!

507
00:42:09,794 --> 00:42:12,957
But I didn't like any of them,
but you..

508
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:14,726
Have you been flirting?

509
00:42:15,133 --> 00:42:16,794
Flirted with a lot of girls!

510
00:42:16,868 --> 00:42:18,563
Don't let your imagination go wild!

511
00:42:18,636 --> 00:42:20,297
At a young age in
school and college..

512
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:22,165
..Don't we sometimes
flirt with some people?

513
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,639
You must have also flirted around!

514
00:42:23,708 --> 00:42:25,233
I meant only that!

515
00:42:25,843 --> 00:42:27,208
You and your silly doubts!

516
00:42:38,256 --> 00:42:39,314
Komali!

517
00:42:40,024 --> 00:42:41,321
I like you so much!

518
00:42:42,994 --> 00:42:44,655
Our physical traits match!

519
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:47,027
Both of us are doing music!

520
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:48,828
Besides, we are in Europe!

521
00:42:49,767 --> 00:42:51,098
Let us enjoy life!

522
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:54,867
- I don't believe in love! -
I too don't believe.

523
00:42:54,939 --> 00:42:57,840
That's why I liked you
after seeing your character!

524
00:42:58,009 --> 00:42:59,602
Not looking at your beauty!

525
00:42:59,677 --> 00:43:01,839
What! Am I not beautiful?

526
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:05,174
Not so beautiful,
that doesn't matter!

527
00:43:10,088 --> 00:43:12,682
Is my character not
superior than my beauty?

528
00:43:12,924 --> 00:43:13,857
Hundred percent!

529
00:43:13,925 --> 00:43:15,393
What is my character?

530
00:43:16,794 --> 00:43:18,592
When you are alone..

531
00:43:19,964 --> 00:43:22,729
..When you know no
one is looking at you..

532
00:43:23,901 --> 00:43:26,927
..Whatever you feel
is your character!

533
00:43:28,039 --> 00:43:31,134
I have understood that!
That's why I liked you!

534
00:43:31,409 --> 00:43:32,774
Is it?

535
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,749
Then how will I
understand your character?

536
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:41,115
What do you do when you are alone?

537
00:43:41,219 --> 00:43:42,983
Should I tell everything openly?

538
00:43:43,087 --> 00:43:44,213
You can make a guess!

539
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:46,781
Sometimes I may walk around naked!

540
00:43:46,891 --> 00:43:47,881
I may watch blue films!

541
00:43:47,959 --> 00:43:49,984
- My God! - Who knows?

542
00:43:51,062 --> 00:43:54,225
At that time, the 'alien'
character within us comes out!

543
00:43:54,332 --> 00:43:58,326
If we study that character,
we can understand who we are.

544
00:44:01,239 --> 00:44:02,798
We are here together!

545
00:44:02,907 --> 00:44:04,068
Did we do anything wrong?

546
00:44:04,408 --> 00:44:06,672
That's what I also said!
Nothing happened!

547
00:44:06,744 --> 00:44:08,075
It is all mere gossips!

548
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:10,744
So when youngsters like us call you..

549
00:44:10,815 --> 00:44:11,839
..Please come with us!

550
00:44:11,916 --> 00:44:13,008
We are terribly grieved!

551
00:44:13,084 --> 00:44:15,109
You must understand our plight!

552
00:44:20,925 --> 00:44:23,417
Dinner is over!

553
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:30,032
I have changed to nightwear!

554
00:44:31,202 --> 00:44:33,296
Then what did I do?

555
00:44:35,273 --> 00:44:37,332
I can't comprehend my own character!

556
00:44:37,441 --> 00:44:39,000
Then how did he comprehend?

557
00:44:41,879 --> 00:44:43,278
- Hello! - Hello!

558
00:44:43,381 --> 00:44:44,712
Hi!

559
00:44:45,149 --> 00:44:47,948
- Are you staying alone? - Yes!

560
00:44:47,985 --> 00:44:50,977
- What are you doing now? -
I am opening the door!

561
00:44:51,155 --> 00:44:54,125
- Where? - At your house!

562
00:44:56,460 --> 00:44:57,723
Hi.

563
00:45:02,133 --> 00:45:03,294
What is this, Sanju?

564
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:04,960
Why did you come here?

565
00:45:06,304 --> 00:45:08,739
Why are you removing your shirt?

566
00:45:10,741 --> 00:45:12,835
Why do you stare at me like this?

567
00:45:14,812 --> 00:45:16,974
Sanju, are you of our class?

568
00:45:19,517 --> 00:45:21,076
Are you a Brahmin?

569
00:45:21,986 --> 00:45:23,147
Bapnese!

570
00:45:24,155 --> 00:45:26,351
What is Bapnese? Is it Japanese?

571
00:45:26,424 --> 00:45:28,984
Converted Brahmins, Bapnese!

572
00:45:29,026 --> 00:45:30,721
Are there converted
people among Brahmins?

573
00:45:30,828 --> 00:45:33,320
Why not? When everyone can convert,
why not Brahmins?

574
00:45:33,364 --> 00:45:35,526
Why should you be so cast conscious?

575
00:45:35,766 --> 00:45:37,825
- Jeez! - To avoid future
complications!

576
00:45:37,902 --> 00:45:40,997
What future com plications
would pop up?

577
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:43,332
Komali!

578
00:45:45,209 --> 00:45:46,176
I love you!

579
00:45:46,777 --> 00:45:49,906
Please, Sanju.
Don't do anything to me!

580
00:45:52,516 --> 00:45:54,951
What did I say and
what are you talking?

581
00:45:55,186 --> 00:45:57,052
I said I love you!

582
00:45:58,022 --> 00:46:01,287
If I say okay,
will you do something to me?

583
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:05,430
It seems if I don't do anything,
you may feel very bad!

584
00:46:05,529 --> 00:46:08,464
You are expecting
something from me, Komali!

585
00:46:08,933 --> 00:46:11,368
- No, Sanju! - Just one kiss!

586
00:46:12,136 --> 00:46:14,036
You wouldn't stop with one kiss!

587
00:46:14,071 --> 00:46:15,038
What?

588
00:46:15,072 --> 00:46:18,042
I said Sanju wouldn't
stop with one kiss!

589
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:20,373
So you agree for a kiss!

590
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:21,969
But you wouldn't stop!

591
00:46:22,046 --> 00:46:23,775
That's my desire too!

592
00:46:23,881 --> 00:46:26,043
No, Sanju! - Silence!

593
00:46:26,083 --> 00:46:27,380
No! I]!

594
00:46:35,326 --> 00:46:39,092
Same room, same place, same bed!

595
00:46:40,931 --> 00:46:43,059
Talked like that. Talked like this.

596
00:46:43,134 --> 00:46:46,069
Somehow boys convince.

597
00:46:47,571 --> 00:46:49,903
Though he is soft..

598
00:46:50,074 --> 00:46:54,238
..He doesn't fit in
with my psychology test!

599
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:00,914
I would stab you with this knife!

600
00:47:00,985 --> 00:47:03,352
Are you so courageous?

601
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:09,017
Come on, man!
If you have the courage, come on!

602
00:47:09,293 --> 00:47:11,625
Why did you ask me
if I stay in the same room?

603
00:47:11,862 --> 00:47:13,261
Are you planning to come here?

604
00:47:13,597 --> 00:47:16,464
Come on, man!

605
00:47:24,608 --> 00:47:27,441
When I am alone,
why is my character like this?

606
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:31,141
Am I so wild?

607
00:47:48,466 --> 00:47:49,456
Hey you..

608
00:48:26,404 --> 00:48:27,371
Oh, no!

609
00:48:29,607 --> 00:48:32,235
I have understood
everything about you!

610
00:48:33,244 --> 00:48:34,336
Complete!

611
00:48:38,516 --> 00:48:40,075
What do you know about me?

612
00:48:42,553 --> 00:48:47,354
Do you have the habit of picking
up girls standing alone on the road?

613
00:48:58,035 --> 00:48:59,264
You would cajole her..

614
00:48:59,370 --> 00:49:01,532
..And take her to the
woods and converse with her!

615
00:49:04,542 --> 00:49:06,943
- Yes or no? - Yes!

616
00:49:08,078 --> 00:49:09,204
I know.

617
00:49:09,246 --> 00:49:11,442
Your behavior pattern
is worse than that!

618
00:49:11,715 --> 00:49:15,151
During nights, you would jump
walls and go to the rooms of girls!

619
00:49:16,253 --> 00:49:18,244
Who said all these things to you?

620
00:49:18,422 --> 00:49:21,289
You said. Your face says everything!

621
00:49:22,493 --> 00:49:24,723
Did you believe
psychology is drollery?

622
00:49:25,162 --> 00:49:26,323
It's a science!

623
00:49:28,232 --> 00:49:30,064
I have understood it only now!

624
00:49:31,168 --> 00:49:32,499
Don't tell this to anyone else!

625
00:49:32,570 --> 00:49:35,301
Please! Keep it a secret!

626
00:49:36,607 --> 00:49:37,665
Drop you?

627
00:49:39,577 --> 00:49:40,635
Okay!

628
00:49:44,748 --> 00:49:46,147
Let's go!

629
00:50:01,031 --> 00:50:02,021
Thank you!

630
00:50:02,266 --> 00:50:03,700
- Bye! - Bye!

631
00:50:07,137 --> 00:50:08,127
Hello!

632
00:50:10,441 --> 00:50:12,307
Now he is dropping you!

633
00:50:13,511 --> 00:50:15,707
- Lucky guy! - Yes, he is!

634
00:50:15,779 --> 00:50:17,008
Yes.

635
00:50:23,153 --> 00:50:24,518
'He is my courage.'

636
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:38,134
- Your name? - Komali!

637
00:50:38,502 --> 00:50:40,630
- Where are you from? - India, sir!

638
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:46,474
Why do you shoot the company?
Is it for time-pass?

639
00:50:49,246 --> 00:50:51,340
Do you know I am going to kidnap you?

640
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:58,149
Leave me, please!

641
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:13,431
'If he had not come
there at that time..'

642
00:51:14,171 --> 00:51:15,195
Hey, you!

643
00:51:22,346 --> 00:51:24,178
Who are you?

644
00:51:52,643 --> 00:51:54,202
Who are you 9"!/57

645
00:52:11,595 --> 00:52:14,792
Who are you guys?
What is it that you want?

646
00:53:10,354 --> 00:53:11,321
Who are they?

647
00:53:11,388 --> 00:53:13,379
They have come looking for you!

648
00:53:13,457 --> 00:53:14,788
I don't know, Sanju!

649
00:53:14,958 --> 00:53:16,323
Why should they kidnap you?

650
00:53:16,393 --> 00:53:17,690
Have you made any mistake here?

651
00:53:17,795 --> 00:53:20,457
Why are you shouting like that?

652
00:53:20,798 --> 00:53:22,960
Am I shouting?What if
something happened to you?

653
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,999
..Ifl had come a minute late,
what would have been your plight?

654
00:53:36,814 --> 00:53:39,215
Fox-like, but smart!

655
00:53:39,316 --> 00:53:40,579
What a funny name!

656
00:53:40,718 --> 00:53:43,312
Did I not tell your mom
about me reading a diary?

657
00:53:43,487 --> 00:53:45,251
This is the title
I have given for that!

658
00:53:45,322 --> 00:53:46,915
At what stage is the story now?

659
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:48,988
That girl could not be found yet!

660
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:52,818
But he comes daily,
sees and talks with me.

661
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:54,425
It is all happening!

662
00:53:55,265 --> 00:53:59,998
But even now he doesn't
know about me reading this diary!

663
00:54:00,504 --> 00:54:03,496
Why do you tell me in piecemeal?
Can't you read it fully and tell me?

664
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:05,008
How will I, mom?

665
00:54:05,342 --> 00:54:08,243
Just after reading two or
three pages, I become romantic!

666
00:54:08,412 --> 00:54:09,777
Come on. Shut up.

667
00:54:16,353 --> 00:54:17,752
Hi, love!

668
00:54:19,857 --> 00:54:21,951
Why are you here alone?

669
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:25,358
When there are so many people around,
how will I be alone?

670
00:54:27,698 --> 00:54:29,894
Are you waiting for someone?

671
00:54:30,734 --> 00:54:32,065
No one to come!

672
00:54:35,939 --> 00:54:40,706
- Sanju! Will you teach
me guitar? - No!

673
00:54:41,411 --> 00:54:44,870
- Please, can't you teach me? - No!

674
00:54:47,484 --> 00:54:52,615
- Do you love someone? - Yes!

675
00:54:53,390 --> 00:54:54,721
Tell me something.

676
00:54:54,925 --> 00:54:58,919
Who knows better about love?
Boys or girls?

677
00:54:59,797 --> 00:55:00,889
What!

678
00:55:01,565 --> 00:55:03,431
What do girls know? Crap!

679
00:55:03,567 --> 00:55:04,625
We only know!

680
00:55:04,735 --> 00:55:05,725
Hello.

681
00:55:05,836 --> 00:55:08,999
The concept of 'love at
first sight' was discovered by us!

682
00:55:09,339 --> 00:55:11,603
We only get love at first sight!

683
00:55:11,675 --> 00:55:13,302
The moment we see a girl..

684
00:55:13,410 --> 00:55:16,846
..Without any second thought,
we only say 'I love you'!

685
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:19,640
From the day this world
came into existence..

686
00:55:19,750 --> 00:55:22,913
..No girl has ever said 'I
love you' to a boy at first sight!

687
00:55:22,953 --> 00:55:25,684
That will never happen!
Then how is it that..

688
00:55:25,756 --> 00:55:28,418
..His character,
background, foreground..

689
00:55:28,492 --> 00:55:31,928
..Only after cross-checking all
these, she expresses her love to him.

690
00:55:32,663 --> 00:55:33,926
If I have to add something more..

691
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:36,864
..Even from a handsome hero,
she would ask for an autograph..

692
00:55:36,934 --> 00:55:38,959
..Only after two or three of
his movies become a box office hit.

693
00:55:39,036 --> 00:55:40,936
Girls' motives are so commercial!

694
00:55:41,038 --> 00:55:42,665
Why should you ask
such questions to me..

695
00:55:42,773 --> 00:55:44,502
..And get replies like this?

696
00:55:45,509 --> 00:55:48,001
Do you have the habit
of writing a diary?

697
00:55:48,111 --> 00:55:49,101
Why do you ask?

698
00:55:49,146 --> 00:55:51,046
Girls can't keep anything in mind!

699
00:55:51,114 --> 00:55:53,879
So they may have to write!
So I asked.

700
00:55:54,518 --> 00:55:57,977
I doubt if he is also
studying psychology.

701
00:56:02,125 --> 00:56:03,490
Sit comfortably!

702
00:56:06,129 --> 00:56:07,528
Take this!

703
00:56:11,835 --> 00:56:13,166
Hold the guitar!

704
00:56:14,838 --> 00:56:17,500
Guitar is invented
for the sake of girls!

705
00:56:19,176 --> 00:56:21,406
These curves are
made for your contours!

706
00:56:22,145 --> 00:56:25,137
This curve is for your chest!

707
00:56:28,485 --> 00:56:30,544
Where do I keep the fingers?

708
00:56:30,654 --> 00:56:33,419
To start with,
hold the guitar closely like this!

709
00:56:33,824 --> 00:56:37,658
Better to use the fingers!
Let this go!

710
00:56:38,562 --> 00:56:40,530
Just close your eyes..

711
00:56:40,898 --> 00:56:42,593
..And the fingers
should touch like this.

712
00:56:42,833 --> 00:56:45,427
Just feel the music!

713
00:56:46,503 --> 00:56:50,701
When Sanju was teaching me guitar,
I just lost myself.

714
00:56:50,874 --> 00:56:54,071
'I myself don't know
what I was feeling then!'

715
00:56:56,179 --> 00:56:59,410
In whatever way I look at,
I am more beautiful than her!

716
00:56:59,883 --> 00:57:02,215
Then why didn't he teach me guitar?

717
00:57:03,020 --> 00:57:04,215
Why should he teach only her?

718
00:57:04,454 --> 00:57:05,512
Komali!

719
00:57:06,623 --> 00:57:09,593
The guitar sits on you,
but where are you seated now?

720
00:57:09,860 --> 00:57:10,725
Master!

721
00:57:10,794 --> 00:57:14,697
He gave his guitar to you
only to em brace you like this!

722
00:57:15,532 --> 00:57:17,523
- He is teaching me! -
Is this the way to teach?

723
00:57:17,601 --> 00:57:19,535
Your fashion and taste has changed!

724
00:57:19,603 --> 00:57:21,071
You forgot your tradition.

725
00:57:21,138 --> 00:57:22,071
You have even changed
the instrument fiddle!

726
00:57:22,139 --> 00:57:23,937
If you stay with
him one more second..

727
00:57:24,041 --> 00:57:27,204
..Along with classical music,
you will also lose your life!

728
00:57:27,778 --> 00:57:30,042
My God! What is this?

729
00:57:32,215 --> 00:57:35,048
Have you torn it?
Have you broken her entirely?

730
00:57:35,218 --> 00:57:36,708
You fellow, you have broken her!

731
00:57:36,753 --> 00:57:38,152
How can I answer your dad?

732
00:57:38,221 --> 00:57:39,916
My God! Come here, come, girl!

733
00:57:39,990 --> 00:57:43,051
Dotty! You are going overboard!

734
00:57:43,493 --> 00:57:45,257
Am I going overboard? - Yes.

735
00:57:45,562 --> 00:57:47,155
Do you know who I am?

736
00:57:47,464 --> 00:57:49,956
Brahmma! Brahmma, the fiddle!

737
00:57:50,067 --> 00:57:53,935
If you are Brahmma,
I am Sanju, Sanju Raddy!

738
00:57:56,139 --> 00:57:58,005
Oh, God!

739
00:57:58,075 --> 00:58:01,477
Each one of them thinks
they are all great people!

740
00:58:02,112 --> 00:58:03,102
I will show you who I am!

741
00:58:03,180 --> 00:58:05,512
I will show all of you. - Show me!

742
00:58:05,582 --> 00:58:06,640
Hello!

743
00:58:06,750 --> 00:58:08,912
Stop, master!
- Sir! I can't handle this pressure!

744
00:58:08,986 --> 00:58:10,249
What happened, man?

745
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:12,615
Your daughter has
gone out of your control!

746
00:58:12,689 --> 00:58:14,020
Shankarabaranam, Sagara sangamam..

747
00:58:14,091 --> 00:58:15,616
..Have all gone in vain!

748
00:58:15,692 --> 00:58:16,784
Considering your health condition"

749
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:19,625
..I am not telling you
about the broken fiddle now!

750
00:58:19,763 --> 00:58:21,663
Is the fiddle broken? How?

751
00:58:21,765 --> 00:58:23,494
Here is a guy called Sanju!

752
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:26,035
He laid his hands on the fiddle!
Praise Lord Shiva!

753
00:58:26,103 --> 00:58:27,764
Now he has laid his
hands on your daughter!

754
00:58:27,804 --> 00:58:29,499
- Praise Lord Shiva! - Who is he?

755
00:58:29,606 --> 00:58:30,767
What is his background?

756
00:58:30,841 --> 00:58:33,606
His background is guitar!
Our background is fiddle!

757
00:58:33,777 --> 00:58:37,611
Western music has
hit our classical music.

758
00:58:37,848 --> 00:58:40,112
Our classical music was smashed!
Oh, God!

759
00:58:40,183 --> 00:58:43,881
I don't think I can do anything, sir!

760
00:58:44,154 --> 00:58:46,623
Have you heard what
your daughter has done?

761
00:58:46,656 --> 00:58:48,124
She has broken my fiddle
and our traditions too!

762
00:58:48,158 --> 00:58:49,319
How will I answer my grandpa?

763
00:58:49,559 --> 00:58:50,958
You can answer him when you go there!

764
00:58:51,128 --> 00:58:52,653
Now ask about her!

765
00:58:52,896 --> 00:58:55,695
Our daughter says
'Praise Lord Shiva'!

766
00:58:55,966 --> 00:58:57,627
You never understand
the head or tail of anything!

767
00:58:57,734 --> 00:58:59,862
He is harried because
he is a bachelor!

768
00:59:00,137 --> 00:59:01,696
Why should you believe him?

769
00:59:01,805 --> 00:59:03,671
Is the mom chiding the daughter?

770
00:59:03,807 --> 00:59:06,071
He says this because of
his concern for our daughter!

771
00:59:06,143 --> 00:59:08,840
Dammit! He is an eccentric person!

772
00:59:08,979 --> 00:59:10,640
Have you forgotten what he did?

773
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:12,876
Thanjavur Kondekodu Vaidyanath has..

774
00:59:12,983 --> 00:59:13,882
..Gifted you a fiddle!

775
00:59:13,984 --> 00:59:16,146
Did he not steal and
run away with that fiddle?

776
00:59:16,186 --> 00:59:18,211
Give the phone to me!
I will talk to that chump!

777
00:59:18,822 --> 00:59:23,020
- Brother! Are you fine? -
I don't want reverence!

778
00:59:23,727 --> 00:59:26,321
A girl's character reflects
on how she was brought up by her mom!

779
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:27,928
Your daughter has lost the fiddle!

780
00:59:27,998 --> 00:59:30,194
Now she can play the guitar!

781
00:59:30,267 --> 00:59:31,860
I will give the phone
to your daughter!

782
00:59:31,935 --> 00:59:34,563
Say whatever you want! Talk, dear!

783
00:59:34,838 --> 00:59:36,169
Who is that boy, dear?

784
00:59:36,673 --> 00:59:39,005
He is Sanju. He is a good boy, mom!

785
00:59:39,209 --> 00:59:41,234
If he is such a good boy,
what is the issue?

786
00:59:41,344 --> 00:59:43,369
What is he doing there?

787
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:45,848
He is a famous guitar player here!

788
00:59:45,882 --> 00:59:48,180
What! Is he a famous guitar player?

789
00:59:48,218 --> 00:59:50,016
He plays in streets.
Do you call this famous?

790
00:59:50,053 --> 00:59:52,215
You may also go and applaud him!

791
00:59:53,890 --> 00:59:56,791
Don't mind him! Give me his address!

792
00:59:56,860 --> 00:59:58,919
Dad will go and inquire everything!

793
01:00:00,030 --> 01:00:01,964
Go to the boy's house
and talk to them.

794
01:00:02,265 --> 01:00:04,700
What should I say?
- What if you talk?

795
01:00:04,868 --> 01:00:05,960
Will you not talk to them?

796
01:00:06,203 --> 01:00:07,693
I ask, will you not talk to them?

797
01:00:10,874 --> 01:00:11,966
What do I do?

798
01:00:12,309 --> 01:00:16,075
All aged men at the
hands of their wives are..

799
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:17,938
Have you gone mad?

800
01:00:18,048 --> 01:00:19,641
Who are you talking to,
sitting alone?

801
01:00:21,651 --> 01:00:23,312
- Come! - No, Sanju!

802
01:00:24,087 --> 01:00:26,215
- I say come here! - No, Sanju!

803
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:27,415
You just keep quiet!

804
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:31,886
You said it would
come when you press it.

805
01:00:31,928 --> 01:00:34,124
- It is quite some time now. -
It will come!

806
01:00:34,231 --> 01:00:35,221
Sanju!

807
01:00:35,298 --> 01:00:37,630
They are caste conscious.
It would create issues!

808
01:00:38,301 --> 01:00:40,668
- Hi. - Hi, everybody!

809
01:00:40,737 --> 01:00:41,898
Hi, Komali!

810
01:00:41,938 --> 01:00:44,908
I am Sanju's dad.
She is my wife Sumathy!

811
01:00:44,975 --> 01:00:47,410
- Hi, darling! - Greetings!

812
01:00:47,744 --> 01:00:48,734
Pingili sir!

813
01:00:48,812 --> 01:00:50,906
That handsome boy is my son Sanju!

814
01:00:50,981 --> 01:00:52,415
- Greetings, uncle! -
I have understood!

815
01:00:52,682 --> 01:00:55,242
This great guy has
smashed our family fiddle!

816
01:00:55,418 --> 01:00:56,852
Why should you talk about that now?

817
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:57,751
Please stay quiet!

818
01:00:58,455 --> 01:01:00,321
Me and Pingili sir
discussed about everything!

819
01:01:00,423 --> 01:01:01,822
We will not object to your love.

820
01:01:01,925 --> 01:01:03,188
We have accepted your love!

821
01:01:04,828 --> 01:01:06,922
We don't have any
reservations on this!

822
01:01:06,963 --> 01:01:08,761
But we do have. Tell them!

823
01:01:08,832 --> 01:01:10,027
Nothing big!

824
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:13,695
Our daughter is a vegeterain!

825
01:01:13,937 --> 01:01:17,100
Your son eats meat.

826
01:01:17,174 --> 01:01:20,269
So if my daughter
is asked to cook them..

827
01:01:20,310 --> 01:01:22,278
Occasionally he does that.

828
01:01:22,345 --> 01:01:25,713
Not daily, only on Sundays. - Sunday.

829
01:01:25,782 --> 01:01:28,774
- On Sundays, go out and dine!-
Okay, dad!

830
01:01:28,885 --> 01:01:29,818
That is not a problem!

831
01:01:29,886 --> 01:01:31,980
Because it is an
inter-caste marriage..

832
01:01:32,055 --> 01:01:33,682
..There is no question
of me giving any dowry!

833
01:01:33,790 --> 01:01:35,781
Come on! That is already explained.

834
01:01:35,859 --> 01:01:37,884
Let the boy also know about it!
In case he demands it later.

835
01:01:38,028 --> 01:01:40,122
One more thing! You are from Kurnool!

836
01:01:40,197 --> 01:01:42,029
Don't keep bombs
or explosives at home.

837
01:01:42,132 --> 01:01:44,123
In case my daughter
handles them unknowingly..

838
01:01:44,201 --> 01:01:45,225
..It would spell doom!
She is our only daughter!

839
01:01:45,302 --> 01:01:46,827
If something happens, it's all gone!

840
01:01:47,971 --> 01:01:48,961
Hear me, sir!

841
01:01:49,139 --> 01:01:52,165
Some incidents might
have happened in this country!

842
01:01:52,242 --> 01:01:54,973
All of us are well-educated
and very disciplined!

843
01:01:55,078 --> 01:01:56,512
I am an MBA graduate!

844
01:01:56,746 --> 01:01:59,215
He is a doctor and
my son has a BTech degree!

845
01:01:59,883 --> 01:02:01,408
Whatever you say..

846
01:02:01,484 --> 01:02:04,215
..There will always be problems
in inter-caste marriages!

847
01:02:04,321 --> 01:02:08,087
Mr. Pingili sir!
First you leave that Chikkadapally.

848
01:02:08,158 --> 01:02:09,751
Come and see Jubilee Hills.

849
01:02:09,826 --> 01:02:11,988
World has progressed.
Times have changed!

850
01:02:12,062 --> 01:02:14,861
The other day a boy from
Kapu caste married a Reddy girl.

851
01:02:14,931 --> 01:02:17,491
Likewise, a Kamma girl
married a boy from Kapu caste.

852
01:02:17,834 --> 01:02:21,270
A Kamma boy from Guntur
married a marathi girl.

853
01:02:21,338 --> 01:02:24,171
Now they have two kids
and lead a happy life!

854
01:02:24,341 --> 01:02:26,833
They are happy and prospoerous.
What is wrong?

855
01:02:26,943 --> 01:02:27,876
Wherever you check..

856
01:02:27,944 --> 01:02:30,208
..These days people marry
among different castes!

857
01:02:30,513 --> 01:02:33,073
If you take that into account,
why should we have caste feelings?

858
01:02:33,250 --> 01:02:36,015
Children are leading a happy life.
That is what we want!

859
01:02:36,186 --> 01:02:38,177
Okay, I agree! One last thing.

860
01:02:38,221 --> 01:02:39,916
I've been playing
fiddle for 40 years!

861
01:02:40,023 --> 01:02:41,013
I've become old too!

862
01:02:41,057 --> 01:02:42,183
Since you are in the ruling party..

863
01:02:42,259 --> 01:02:45,285
..If you can influence someone
and get me a Padmashree award..

864
01:02:45,362 --> 01:02:46,420
..I can have a happy end to my life!

865
01:02:46,529 --> 01:02:48,964
You can't get Padmashree like that!

866
01:02:50,033 --> 01:02:51,933
Don't worry! I will try my best!

867
01:02:52,035 --> 01:02:53,867
Consider it done! - That is Raddy

868
01:02:53,903 --> 01:02:55,234
Give me your hand!

869
01:03:36,579 --> 01:03:39,276
"Hi, just let me be your man!"

870
01:03:39,349 --> 01:03:41,078
"I want to hold your hand."

871
01:03:41,251 --> 01:03:44,414
"And take you to your fantasy."

872
01:03:48,258 --> 01:03:51,125
"Eyes! When I look into your eyes.."

873
01:03:51,194 --> 01:03:56,928
"..you make me realize, O baby!
You are the only one for me."

874
01:04:00,537 --> 01:04:07,944
"My dear seducer.
My passionate lover!"

875
01:04:08,144 --> 01:04:11,637
"Delightful,
handsome canny love-torn guy!"

876
01:04:11,981 --> 01:04:15,611
"Would give you the pleasure today!"

877
01:04:16,019 --> 01:04:20,456
"Girl, given you a lightning
flowery kiss on lips!"

878
01:04:20,623 --> 01:04:23,558
"Now I will acquire
the entire world!"

879
01:04:23,626 --> 01:04:26,220
"You are a romantic ornate platter!"

880
01:04:26,529 --> 01:04:28,361
"From now on,
it's the blooming season always!"

881
01:04:28,498 --> 01:04:33,231
"Come sliding in
this dreamy chariot!"

882
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:50,914
"Every day, every night,
every wrong, every right!"

883
01:04:50,987 --> 01:04:55,185
"With your plumy fingers,
dish out honey!"

884
01:04:55,325 --> 01:05:02,561
"Propitious,
bonny, soft cherubic lovely guy!"

885
01:05:02,999 --> 01:05:06,492
"When you hug me, joy fills me!"

886
01:05:06,936 --> 01:05:10,998
"I am near you for you
to realize your dreams!"

887
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:18,674
"Gilded, moonlike,
gentle, gives refuge, exudes valor!"

888
01:05:19,048 --> 01:05:22,678
"You are my golden twilight.."

889
01:05:22,719 --> 01:05:26,713
"..you can forever sleep on my lap!"

890
01:05:26,956 --> 01:05:31,359
"Girl, given you a lightning
flowery kiss on lips!"

891
01:05:31,528 --> 01:05:34,691
"Now I will acquire
the entire world!"

892
01:05:34,731 --> 01:05:37,291
"You are a romantic ornate platter!"

893
01:05:37,434 --> 01:05:39,402
"From now on,
it's blooming season always!"

894
01:05:39,469 --> 01:05:43,736
"Come sliding in
this dreamy chariot!"

895
01:06:06,162 --> 01:06:09,962
"Every word, every thought,
every move, every blood."

896
01:06:10,066 --> 01:06:14,128
"To effuse,
dissolve, will you come within me?"

897
01:06:14,237 --> 01:06:21,576
"Infinite chivalrous,
humble, noble, brave guy!"

898
01:06:21,744 --> 01:06:25,612
"When love gushes out
like water from a braced dam .."

899
01:06:25,682 --> 01:06:29,778
"..you fill my body
like a bright chill ray!"

900
01:06:30,019 --> 01:06:37,653
"Soft-spoken,
mellifluous, comely humorous buff!"

901
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:41,594
"Songs that slipped my memory.."

902
01:06:41,664 --> 01:06:46,033
"..I sing now and will be a boon!"

903
01:06:46,102 --> 01:06:50,039
"Girl, you're like a quest to moon.
Such a refreshing tune."

904
01:06:50,340 --> 01:06:53,435
"You got me singing every verse!"

905
01:06:53,476 --> 01:06:57,640
"Welcome into my galaxy.
Come, fly away with me."

906
01:06:58,214 --> 01:07:01,275
"Our love is like the universe."

907
01:07:19,369 --> 01:07:23,465
'Day after tomorrow, dad and mom
are coming by the 9 o'clock flight!'

908
01:07:23,540 --> 01:07:25,235
'Just a few days
more for our marriage!'

909
01:07:25,675 --> 01:07:29,134
'Sanju is taking care
of shopping personally!'

910
01:07:31,581 --> 01:07:35,074
_'I am praying to god
hopmg everything goes well!'

911
01:07:35,151 --> 01:07:37,245
'In the mean time, I got a call!'

912
01:07:44,327 --> 01:07:45,692
Why are the pages blank?

913
01:07:47,063 --> 01:07:48,258
Why has she not written the rest?

914
01:07:50,199 --> 01:07:52,190
Did she marry him or not?

915
01:07:53,770 --> 01:07:55,260
What must have happened?

916
01:08:06,115 --> 01:08:07,207
Sanju!

917
01:08:09,285 --> 01:08:10,582
Where is Komali?

918
01:08:12,388 --> 01:08:14,356
How do you know about Komali?

919
01:08:15,725 --> 01:08:17,887
I stay in the room
where Komali lived!

920
01:08:18,528 --> 01:08:20,223
I got her diary!

921
01:08:21,864 --> 01:08:25,698
Till today I was reading
your love story so curiously!

922
01:08:25,768 --> 01:08:27,759
It says you were
about to get married.

923
01:08:28,204 --> 01:08:29,535
What happened afterwards?

924
01:08:34,544 --> 01:08:35,739
Where is Komali?

925
01:08:38,214 --> 01:08:39,579
Did you break up?

926
01:08:43,319 --> 01:08:45,310
Did something happen to Komali?

927
01:09:01,404 --> 01:09:01,927
Hello!

928
01:09:02,171 --> 01:09:03,639
- Is it Komali? - Yes!

929
01:09:03,740 --> 01:09:06,232
'This is Dr.
Stephens from Hilton Hospitals!'

930
01:09:06,309 --> 01:09:08,243
'Mr. Sanju had just
met with an accident!'

931
01:09:08,277 --> 01:09:11,440
'He is in a serious condition!
Please come immediately!'

932
01:09:19,155 --> 01:09:22,648
- Komali! - Sanju!

933
01:09:22,759 --> 01:09:25,251
- Sanju, did you.. - Come on!

934
01:09:25,328 --> 01:09:26,454
Sanju!

935
01:09:27,163 --> 01:09:28,426
Sanju!

936
01:09:31,434 --> 01:09:32,526
Sanju!

937
01:09:33,670 --> 01:09:36,332
Push her in. Go!

938
01:09:36,439 --> 01:09:37,600
Sanju!

939
01:10:05,234 --> 01:10:07,999
Check if she has the camera with her!

940
01:10:34,764 --> 01:10:35,595
Got it!

941
01:10:35,665 --> 01:10:36,928
To whom did she send it. Ask her.

942
01:10:36,999 --> 01:10:38,023
Who else did you send it to?

943
01:10:40,269 --> 01:10:42,829
I don't know when this was shot.

944
01:10:42,905 --> 01:10:45,533
Don't you know? Tell me.

945
01:10:45,942 --> 01:10:48,343
Bloody girl! She is acting smart.
Beat her and find it!

946
01:10:48,377 --> 01:10:49,674
Tell me.

947
01:11:31,387 --> 01:11:33,719
Tell me. Whom did you give that to?

948
01:11:57,780 --> 01:11:58,838
You.

949
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:06,420
San] u

950
01:13:23,699 --> 01:13:24,894
San] u

951
01:13:29,572 --> 01:13:30,733
San] u

952
01:16:58,614 --> 01:16:59,979
Komali!

953
01:17:03,385 --> 01:17:04,750
Komali!

954
01:17:07,056 --> 01:17:08,080
Komali!

955
01:18:25,801 --> 01:18:27,326
Thank you! Thank you!

956
01:18:29,905 --> 01:18:30,997
Thank you!

957
01:18:32,741 --> 01:18:34,869
- Good night, see you tomorrow. -
See you!

958
01:18:45,087 --> 01:18:46,145
Sanju!

959
01:18:48,090 --> 01:18:50,058
Sanju, what happened to Komali?

960
01:18:52,394 --> 01:18:54,021
I want to meet her!

961
01:18:55,931 --> 01:18:58,332
Tell me, where is she?

962
01:19:06,508 --> 01:19:07,532
No!

963
01:19:10,779 --> 01:19:11,905
She is dead!

964
01:19:14,850 --> 01:19:16,045
She was killed!

965
01:19:21,790 --> 01:19:23,519
They killed my Komali!

966
01:19:33,936 --> 01:19:37,770
Though I do not personally
know Komali, I fell very sad.

967
01:19:38,073 --> 01:19:39,939
What about Sanju who loved her?

968
01:19:40,042 --> 01:19:42,443
I can understand how
painful it is for him.

969
01:19:42,978 --> 01:19:46,141
I don't want Sanju
to be alone like that.

970
01:19:46,382 --> 01:19:47,941
He will not come out..

971
01:19:48,050 --> 01:19:50,542
..Of Komali's memories unless
I go close to his heart.

972
01:19:50,786 --> 01:19:51,446
I will do that.

973
01:19:51,887 --> 01:19:54,879
Whichever ministry it is,
during their rule of five years..

974
01:19:54,957 --> 01:19:56,584
..They try to earn the maximum.
Other than that..

975
01:19:56,825 --> 01:19:59,817
..Do they think about
our country for a minute?

976
01:20:01,163 --> 01:20:04,292
No reaction even after
an IAS officer has been killed!

977
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:05,890
I am a central minister!

978
01:20:05,934 --> 01:20:08,335
How many times can I tell them?

979
01:20:08,437 --> 01:20:10,565
What is the CBI doing?

980
01:20:11,073 --> 01:20:14,065
If the case is not decided,
I will decide to resign!

981
01:20:14,109 --> 01:20:17,010
Mom, did I not tell
you about a love story?

982
01:20:17,246 --> 01:20:19,305
Someone has killed that Komali!

983
01:20:19,448 --> 01:20:21,507
My God! How is it?

984
01:20:22,251 --> 01:20:24,015
Then how is that boy?

985
01:20:24,086 --> 01:20:25,986
He is very dull!

986
01:20:26,121 --> 01:20:27,611
What is it? What happened?

987
01:20:28,023 --> 01:20:30,492
Did she not tell about a love story?

988
01:20:30,592 --> 01:20:32,185
Poor girl, someone has killed her!

989
01:20:32,494 --> 01:20:34,986
- Our daughter is very dull.-
Give it to me!

990
01:20:36,532 --> 01:20:39,467
Is what you said
a story or a real one?

991
01:20:39,535 --> 01:20:42,129
True, daddy!
It really happened really!

992
01:20:42,504 --> 01:20:43,369
Look, darling!

993
01:20:43,872 --> 01:20:45,601
Nothing happens the way we want!

994
01:20:45,641 --> 01:20:47,040
That is life!

995
01:20:47,343 --> 01:20:49,107
Life is not in our hands!

996
01:20:49,144 --> 01:20:51,112
If it is in our hands,
it is not life!

997
01:20:51,280 --> 01:20:52,941
You are a psychology student!

998
01:20:53,048 --> 01:20:54,880
Think about that!
Why should you be grieved?

999
01:21:04,293 --> 01:21:07,957
Sari, sari, sari. Ni sari ga..

1000
01:21:12,634 --> 01:21:14,295
Hey, master!

1001
01:21:14,503 --> 01:21:15,299
Who are you, man?

1002
01:21:15,371 --> 01:21:18,033
I am Krishna! I am from Gudiwada.

1003
01:21:18,474 --> 01:21:20,875
Your get-up does not match Gudiwada.

1004
01:21:20,976 --> 01:21:22,967
- You must help me!-
What is that you want?

1005
01:21:23,045 --> 01:21:24,479
You are an emperor of music!

1006
01:21:24,646 --> 01:21:26,011
I have heard that by playing fiddle..

1007
01:21:26,081 --> 01:21:28,516
..You have made a seed sprout
and caused a down pour of rain!

1008
01:21:28,584 --> 01:21:30,074
Is it a fact, master?

1009
01:21:30,652 --> 01:21:34,680
I have even made coma
patients get up from bed!

1010
01:21:35,023 --> 01:21:39,187
I believe you!
So I am making an appeal to you!

1011
01:21:39,261 --> 01:21:40,387
What is it? Tell me!

1012
01:21:40,496 --> 01:21:45,093
Back home everyone
calls me mental Krishna!

1013
01:21:47,202 --> 01:21:49,000
But you don't look so Krishna!

1014
01:21:49,037 --> 01:21:51,506
No, master! What they say is right!

1015
01:21:51,673 --> 01:21:55,940
I am slightly nutsy!
Master, you couldn't make out!

1016
01:21:56,078 --> 01:21:58,376
It is very simple!
If I play two com positions“

1017
01:21:58,447 --> 01:22:01,178
..your entire memory
board will be cleaned!

1018
01:22:01,283 --> 01:22:02,341
Thanks, master!

1019
01:22:02,418 --> 01:22:04,386
I want to make an
offering to you, master!

1020
01:22:04,453 --> 01:22:06,182
That is not required, man!
Give it after you get cured.

1021
01:22:06,255 --> 01:22:08,053
Please don't say that!
Please don't decline!

1022
01:22:08,123 --> 01:22:09,557
If you are so particular,
then give me!

1023
01:22:11,960 --> 01:22:12,620
Hi!

1024
01:22:12,694 --> 01:22:13,684
Come.

1025
01:22:13,729 --> 01:22:16,699
- Master, this is the gift! -
Is this a gift?

1026
01:22:17,533 --> 01:22:20,195
No student of yours would
have given such a gift!

1027
01:22:20,269 --> 01:22:21,134
Thai is why I am giving this gift!

1028
01:22:21,203 --> 01:22:24,229
- Accept it! - I don't want
a gift of this size!

1029
01:22:24,306 --> 01:22:27,037
Even if you kindly accept,
I will take it back later!

1030
01:22:27,376 --> 01:22:29,572
- Until then, take
care of her! - Okay!

1031
01:22:31,113 --> 01:22:32,444
She looks skiny.

1032
01:22:32,581 --> 01:22:34,310
But she pinched my very hard.

1033
01:22:53,735 --> 01:22:55,396
How did you come here?

1034
01:22:56,638 --> 01:22:59,335
Hi, Sanju. Coffee ready!

1035
01:22:59,741 --> 01:23:02,972
- When did you come? -
Questions later!

1036
01:23:05,981 --> 01:23:07,471
Hi, Sanju!

1037
01:23:07,649 --> 01:23:08,673
Good morning.

1038
01:23:09,518 --> 01:23:12,647
My God! What a great shock!

1039
01:23:13,021 --> 01:23:14,511
Why have all of you come?

1040
01:23:15,157 --> 01:23:17,251
Are you asking how we came? Ask her!

1041
01:23:17,292 --> 01:23:20,660
- Where is Karim? - He is there!

1042
01:23:21,363 --> 01:23:23,195
I am here, buddy!

1043
01:23:23,665 --> 01:23:28,034
When you left us,
everything was over, buddy!

1044
01:23:28,270 --> 01:23:31,535
When we were all together,
we had some money!

1045
01:23:31,707 --> 01:23:34,608
Now there is no band
and no money in hand!

1046
01:23:35,110 --> 01:23:36,771
We can start it again!

1047
01:23:39,515 --> 01:23:41,779
If you brood all the time,
will your grief be over?

1048
01:23:42,284 --> 01:23:43,274
Move on, man!

1049
01:23:45,621 --> 01:23:47,146
The Sanju I know is different!

1050
01:23:47,823 --> 01:23:49,791
And the Sanju I see now is different!

1051
01:23:51,193 --> 01:23:53,491
We can't brook your glum!

1052
01:23:54,229 --> 01:23:56,197
Start the music, baby! Come on!

1053
01:23:56,832 --> 01:23:57,822
What is left to think about?

1054
01:23:58,066 --> 01:24:00,057
Tomorrow is the festival day.

1055
01:24:00,135 --> 01:24:01,728
Let us start again. -
Please! - Sanju! Please!

1056
01:24:14,816 --> 01:24:18,810
"Praise Lord Ganesha.
Praise Lord Ganesha!"

1057
01:24:19,054 --> 01:24:23,150
"Praise Lord Ganesha.
Praise Lord Ganesha!"

1058
01:24:23,225 --> 01:24:27,184
"Praise Lord Ganesha.
Praise Lord Ganesha!"

1059
01:24:27,329 --> 01:24:31,391
"Praise Lord Ganesha.
Praise Lord Ganesha!"

1060
01:24:31,500 --> 01:24:33,696
"O Lord Ganesha with
curved trunk and mighty body."

1061
01:24:33,835 --> 01:24:35,701
Praise Lord Ganesh

1062
01:24:35,837 --> 01:24:38,067
"Magnificent with million suns!"

1063
01:24:38,173 --> 01:24:39,663
Praise Lord Ganesh

1064
01:24:39,708 --> 01:24:42,336
"Remove all obstacles, Lord!"

1065
01:24:42,411 --> 01:24:44,175
Praise Lord Ganesh

1066
01:24:44,246 --> 01:24:48,080
"Remove snags from everything I do!"

1067
01:24:48,584 --> 01:24:52,418
"Praise Lord Ganesha.
Praise Lord Ganesha!"

1068
01:24:52,721 --> 01:24:56,851
"Praise Lord Ganesha.
Praise Lord Ganesha!"

1069
01:24:57,092 --> 01:25:00,858
"Praise Lord Ganesha.
Praise Lord Ganesha!"

1070
01:25:01,129 --> 01:25:05,726
"Praise Lord Ganesha.
Praise Lord Ganesha!"

1071
01:25:09,371 --> 01:25:13,308
"Hello. Hello. I will sing."

1072
01:25:13,575 --> 01:25:17,375
"Are you hearing me, girl? Hello."

1073
01:25:17,779 --> 01:25:21,716
"Tell me. Tell me with passion!"

1074
01:25:21,750 --> 01:25:24,219
"Did you call me? Did you beckon me?"

1075
01:25:24,319 --> 01:25:26,310
"Did you rap a string
instrument to call me?"

1076
01:25:26,388 --> 01:25:30,222
"Praise Lord Ganesha.
Praise Lord Ganesha!"

1077
01:25:30,292 --> 01:25:34,923
"Praise Lord Ganesha.
Praise Lord Ganesha!"

1078
01:25:55,951 --> 01:25:58,921
"When you look with enlarged eyes.."

1079
01:25:59,821 --> 01:26:02,916
"..is the left side
of my chest visible?"

1080
01:26:04,159 --> 01:26:06,287
"Do you feel like dancing
to the throbbing beats?"

1081
01:26:06,361 --> 01:26:09,296
"Did you fly like a pigeon?"

1082
01:26:10,532 --> 01:26:13,627
"Did you come within
me as a dulcet ocean?"

1083
01:26:14,670 --> 01:26:17,605
"I feel like swimming there!"

1084
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:20,968
"Are you extending your dreams?"

1085
01:26:21,209 --> 01:26:23,940
"Are we rushing towards heaven?"

1086
01:26:24,780 --> 01:26:29,217
"We are from India.
With you ma mania!"

1087
01:26:29,484 --> 01:26:34,388
"Every cool thing is moving upwards,
my dear!"

1088
01:26:35,957 --> 01:26:38,983
"Are you ready for the Indian dance?"

1089
01:26:54,976 --> 01:26:59,311
"Praise Lord Ganesha.
Praise Lord Ganesha!"

1090
01:26:59,347 --> 01:27:03,477
"Praise Lord Ganesha.
Praise Lord Ganesha!"

1091
01:27:03,518 --> 01:27:12,484
"Praise Lord Ganesha.
Praise Lord Ganesha!"

1092
01:27:26,608 --> 01:27:29,543
"Praise Lord Ganesha.
Praise Lord Ganesha!"

1093
01:27:31,847 --> 01:27:33,542
Shankarabaranam. - Good morning.

1094
01:27:34,282 --> 01:27:35,010
Come! Come!

1095
01:27:35,250 --> 01:27:37,617
What, master!
You seem to be very pleasant!

1096
01:27:37,853 --> 01:27:40,845
When I have students like you,
I would be pleasant always!

1097
01:27:41,022 --> 01:27:42,421
It seems like you are in a good mood!

1098
01:27:42,524 --> 01:27:43,548
Shall we start the treatment?

1099
01:27:43,625 --> 01:27:45,059
Come on! Done!

1100
01:27:47,863 --> 01:27:51,390
"Sit down, Rang ”

1101
01:27:52,367 --> 01:27:56,395
'In your mind, must you ponder.'

1102
01:27:56,772 --> 01:28:00,640
'In your mind, must you ponder.'

1103
01:28:00,776 --> 01:28:01,937
Master!

1104
01:28:02,043 --> 01:28:03,067
What is it?

1105
01:28:03,712 --> 01:28:06,044
What is the difference between
a demented guy and a psycho?

1106
01:28:06,281 --> 01:28:08,306
Demented is like you, small!

1107
01:28:08,383 --> 01:28:09,942
Psycho is bigger than that!

1108
01:28:11,052 --> 01:28:13,316
We don't have music to heal that.

1109
01:28:17,559 --> 01:28:19,584
What, man? Why are you crying?

1110
01:28:19,728 --> 01:28:23,323
This society has
declared me a psycho.

1111
01:28:24,399 --> 01:28:27,460
Psycho? You must be called demented!

1112
01:28:28,804 --> 01:28:30,966
Have I got into any problem?

1113
01:28:31,306 --> 01:28:32,899
Not that Krishna.

1114
01:28:33,408 --> 01:28:35,934
I meant you said you are demented.

1115
01:28:36,011 --> 01:28:40,505
When the society is calling me a
psycho, you are calling me demented?

1116
01:28:40,582 --> 01:28:42,072
Why are you taking out that knife?

1117
01:28:43,919 --> 01:28:46,513
My God! Don't trouble me!

1118
01:28:46,588 --> 01:28:47,749
I am a poor gllY!

1119
01:28:48,690 --> 01:28:52,456
I will cut you into
pieces with this knife..

1120
01:28:52,527 --> 01:28:55,087
..And dry you like a fish.

1121
01:28:55,430 --> 01:28:58,491
You are a psycho! I have understood!

1122
01:28:58,867 --> 01:29:00,835
Master! - What, man?

1123
01:29:00,936 --> 01:29:02,768
Can we start the treatment?

1124
01:29:02,871 --> 01:29:05,636
Sorry, man!
It won't help to cure a psycho.

1125
01:29:05,941 --> 01:29:07,773
Then how will I treat you?

1126
01:29:07,976 --> 01:29:09,705
So is it not possible?

1127
01:29:10,145 --> 01:29:11,635
I respect your decision, master!

1128
01:29:11,947 --> 01:29:13,005
I am going back to Gudiwada!

1129
01:29:13,114 --> 01:29:14,775
Thank you, man! Get up!

1130
01:29:14,850 --> 01:29:16,978
So you return the gift
I gave you the other day!

1131
01:29:17,052 --> 01:29:19,487
Do you mean the gift you gave me?
Where is it?

1132
01:29:19,621 --> 01:29:22,056
She has gone with someone!
You go and find out!

1133
01:29:23,491 --> 01:29:24,959
Gift should be hidden.

1134
01:29:25,026 --> 01:29:26,551
Don't let her go with anybody - Yes!

1135
01:29:26,628 --> 01:29:28,619
Tell me where my gift is!

1136
01:29:28,730 --> 01:29:31,631
What can I do? She was here at night!

1137
01:29:31,733 --> 01:29:33,064
I saw her sending
some message to someone!

1138
01:29:33,134 --> 01:29:34,465
She left with someone this morning!

1139
01:29:34,502 --> 01:29:37,733
If you return my gift,
I will return to Gudiwada!

1140
01:29:37,906 --> 01:29:42,707
Else after killing you,
I will go to jail!

1141
01:29:44,980 --> 01:29:50,043
All of them call me psycho!
- What can I do about that?

1142
01:29:50,919 --> 01:29:52,409
Please, man.

1143
01:29:59,060 --> 01:30:00,050
What's your name?

1144
01:30:00,896 --> 01:30:01,658
Akanksha!

1145
01:30:01,730 --> 01:30:04,495
- Do you wanna go for a ride? - No!

1146
01:30:04,666 --> 01:30:05,827
Come, baby. Let's go!

1147
01:30:05,901 --> 01:30:07,892
Leave me. Let me go!

1148
01:30:08,103 --> 01:30:09,832
You stop there!

1149
01:30:16,912 --> 01:30:20,075
At that moment,
I felt like he is my army.

1150
01:30:23,518 --> 01:30:25,008
I will break your head!

1151
01:30:30,592 --> 01:30:32,082
Okay, break! Break!

1152
01:30:33,028 --> 01:30:33,961
I love you!

1153
01:30:40,735 --> 01:30:43,102
Wait, man! This is a proposal!

1154
01:30:44,539 --> 01:30:45,529
What did you say?

1155
01:30:47,642 --> 01:30:48,734
I have already said it.

1156
01:30:48,810 --> 01:30:51,711
- Come again. - I love you!

1157
01:30:53,448 --> 01:30:55,576
- I had to. - What?

1158
01:30:57,452 --> 01:31:01,787
Any girl would be fortunate
to get a bodyguard boyfriend!

1159
01:31:02,057 --> 01:31:03,115
What is she saying?

1160
01:31:03,558 --> 01:31:07,051
Some security problems, let's go!

1161
01:31:14,102 --> 01:31:16,799
Ou wouldn't have said I love
you if they had not come, right?

1162
01:31:17,238 --> 01:31:20,902
Reddy, I opened up because
the moment was like that.

1163
01:31:21,242 --> 01:31:23,609
Otherwise I had fallen
for you long ago!

1164
01:31:23,979 --> 01:31:28,815
That diary I read,
I read it again and again.

1165
01:31:28,917 --> 01:31:30,009
Is it out of pity?

1166
01:31:30,618 --> 01:31:32,916
What do you know about
me to say you love me?

1167
01:31:33,521 --> 01:31:35,683
Hello! It is psychology, man!

1168
01:31:35,790 --> 01:31:37,485
Psychology! Go from here!

1169
01:31:37,759 --> 01:31:38,988
This is not the right place!

1170
01:31:39,260 --> 01:31:40,785
You come to the woods with me!

1171
01:31:41,096 --> 01:31:42,154
We can talk there!

1172
01:31:43,932 --> 01:31:44,592
No!

1173
01:31:45,266 --> 01:31:46,700
Do you know who I am?

1174
01:31:47,202 --> 01:31:49,261
I am the daughter
of a central minister!

1175
01:31:49,971 --> 01:31:54,602
If you don't come with me to the
woods, the woods will come to you!

1176
01:31:54,642 --> 01:31:56,940
Don't lose a good chance, man!

1177
01:31:56,978 --> 01:31:58,946
Take hold of her!

1178
01:32:00,949 --> 01:32:02,610
Look into my eyes!

1179
01:32:03,518 --> 01:32:05,816
I am already doing that!

1180
01:32:06,621 --> 01:32:11,149
I don't have the mind or
interest to love another girl now!

1181
01:32:11,993 --> 01:32:14,792
Why do you say those
words by coming so close?

1182
01:32:15,063 --> 01:32:16,292
For effect.

1183
01:32:18,733 --> 01:32:21,862
Reddy, will you say no to me?

1184
01:32:22,237 --> 01:32:24,672
I am the daughter
of a central minister!

1185
01:32:24,973 --> 01:32:27,806
Every man has his
weakness and temptations!

1186
01:32:27,876 --> 01:32:29,002
Just hit at that!

1187
01:32:29,077 --> 01:32:30,306
There is sufficient
money in your credit card!

1188
01:32:30,545 --> 01:32:31,910
Then what is preventing you?

1189
01:32:31,980 --> 01:32:34,244
We will be with you! What do you say?

1190
01:32:40,155 --> 01:32:41,645
Call for you, sir!

1191
01:32:41,723 --> 01:32:43,691
- Who is it? - Narasimhan!

1192
01:32:46,995 --> 01:32:48,326
- Hello! - What is this, sir?

1193
01:32:48,363 --> 01:32:50,855
As instructed by you,
we have transferred the cash..

1194
01:32:50,932 --> 01:32:53,731
..From Kochi to Singapore
and from Singapore to Indonesia!

1195
01:32:53,835 --> 01:32:54,825
Two months have passed since then.

1196
01:32:55,003 --> 01:32:56,164
My brother is an IAS officer, sir.

1197
01:32:56,337 --> 01:32:57,930
He lost his job and
now languishing in jail.

1198
01:32:58,006 --> 01:33:00,373
You offered 5%.
But you didn't pay a single rupee.

1199
01:33:00,675 --> 01:33:03,007
- What is this, sir? -
Did that cash reach me?

1200
01:33:03,178 --> 01:33:05,613
It has not. After keeping
it in international waters..

1201
01:33:05,680 --> 01:33:10,174
..For over two months,
it was taken to Spain one month ago.

1202
01:33:10,285 --> 01:33:13,050
Do you know the stress
I am undergoing?

1203
01:33:13,121 --> 01:33:15,715
What if my brother opens
his mouth in front of the police?

1204
01:33:15,790 --> 01:33:17,781
Are you intimidating me?

1205
01:33:17,859 --> 01:33:21,693
If it is leaked, he will be finished!

1206
01:33:32,373 --> 01:33:33,397
Hello!

1207
01:33:34,409 --> 01:33:36,377
Is he still in coma?

1208
01:33:38,780 --> 01:33:40,043
What is the doctor saying?

1209
01:33:40,081 --> 01:33:41,378
He is not responding medically!

1210
01:33:41,716 --> 01:33:42,979
But he says he can regain
consciousness any minute!

1211
01:33:43,218 --> 01:33:44,652
Save him quickly!

1212
01:33:45,220 --> 01:33:46,710
1 lakh crore rupees are blocked!

1213
01:33:47,055 --> 01:33:51,049
He has not told anyone so
far where he has kept that money!

1214
01:33:51,826 --> 01:33:55,057
If we delay it any further,
it would become an issue!

1215
01:34:19,420 --> 01:34:20,080
Hey!

1216
01:34:20,121 --> 01:34:21,179
Hey, you!

1217
01:34:52,353 --> 01:34:53,184
What?

1218
01:34:54,055 --> 01:34:57,320
Did he try to kidnap my
brother from the hospital?

1219
01:34:57,392 --> 01:34:58,826
- Yes, sir. - Who is he?

1220
01:34:58,893 --> 01:34:59,451
I don't know, sir!

1221
01:34:59,694 --> 01:35:02,686
Someone who knows about
the money is after him!

1222
01:35:02,797 --> 01:35:03,787
Sir! It would be better to..

1223
01:35:03,865 --> 01:35:05,799
..Get your brother out of
the hospital as soon as possible.

1224
01:35:05,833 --> 01:35:08,029
No, let him be there!

1225
01:35:08,403 --> 01:35:11,031
Only then will it be easy for us!

1226
01:35:12,073 --> 01:35:13,734
I want that guy!

1227
01:35:20,982 --> 01:35:22,313
Is there any improvement, man?

1228
01:35:23,818 --> 01:35:24,717
Is it not?

1229
01:35:25,153 --> 01:35:27,212
O Lord Shiva!

1230
01:35:33,928 --> 01:35:34,520
Hello!

1231
01:35:36,164 --> 01:35:38,861
Return my gift!
I will return to Gudiwada.

1232
01:35:39,334 --> 01:35:41,166
Since night to this moment.

1233
01:35:41,236 --> 01:35:43,364
..I have been playing
the fiddle only for that!

1234
01:35:43,438 --> 01:35:46,840
How can you still say that, man?

1235
01:35:48,776 --> 01:35:51,074
Why do you stay motionless
and stare at me?

1236
01:35:52,180 --> 01:35:53,511
Then you come for bathing!

1237
01:35:53,781 --> 01:35:56,182
- Me to bathe with you! -
Follow my instructions, master!

1238
01:35:56,217 --> 01:35:58,743
How will I take bath if you stand in
front of me? Don't I have any shame?

1239
01:35:58,853 --> 01:36:01,185
You must bathe here!
Bathe sans water!

1240
01:36:01,356 --> 01:36:02,551
Bathing sans water?

1241
01:36:02,857 --> 01:36:04,018
How is it possible, man?

1242
01:36:04,359 --> 01:36:07,192
Bathe in Shankarabaranam!

1243
01:36:07,462 --> 01:36:09,123
Can take a shower in
Shanarabaranam (Raga)..

1244
01:36:09,197 --> 01:36:11,461
..Afterwards Keeravani (Raga).

1245
01:36:13,368 --> 01:36:15,200
Do you want me to
bathe in Shankarabaranam?

1246
01:36:15,370 --> 01:36:17,862
You are not a mere crazy guy!
You are perverse too!

1247
01:36:17,905 --> 01:36:20,101
You are not a mere psycho.
You are psycho square!

1248
01:36:20,208 --> 01:36:23,872
I would kill and bury you!

1249
01:36:45,166 --> 01:36:47,794
I have brought all of
you here with great difficulty!

1250
01:36:47,902 --> 01:36:49,097
Didn't I bring you together?

1251
01:36:49,237 --> 01:36:51,069
You said you will settle
the matter. - What?

1252
01:36:51,272 --> 01:36:54,936
You are drinking like
animals but not doing anything.

1253
01:36:55,076 --> 01:36:58,239
Sanju! Your are
missing a good figure?

1254
01:36:58,413 --> 01:37:02,077
- Figure? - I mean don't
miss a good girl!

1255
01:37:02,116 --> 01:37:03,413
Ponder over it!

1256
01:37:03,584 --> 01:37:06,315
- I do not love anybody! -
But I love you.

1257
01:37:06,521 --> 01:37:09,422
Akanksha,
you love me because of your ego!

1258
01:37:09,924 --> 01:37:12,916
Love means surrendering ego, sir!

1259
01:37:13,261 --> 01:37:14,194
Correct!

1260
01:37:14,996 --> 01:37:17,124
Even if you abuse me,
I would love it!

1261
01:37:17,332 --> 01:37:19,096
I like even if you spit at me!

1262
01:37:20,001 --> 01:37:21,093
Even if you ask me to go..

1263
01:37:21,169 --> 01:37:24,002
..I would never leave you.
Understood?

1264
01:37:24,138 --> 01:37:25,936
That is called real love!

1265
01:37:26,474 --> 01:37:29,307
Whatever you say,
I can never forget those days.

1266
01:37:29,444 --> 01:37:31,276
You need not forget! Let it be there.

1267
01:37:31,346 --> 01:37:33,610
You take her and
imagine she is Komali!

1268
01:37:33,848 --> 01:37:36,874
You call her Komali!
You come in a traditional dress!

1269
01:37:36,951 --> 01:37:39,852
Stop it, man! I can't do it!

1270
01:37:40,455 --> 01:37:41,650
Why can't you do it?

1271
01:37:42,357 --> 01:37:45,520
If you consume two pegs,
Komali and I would look alike!

1272
01:37:46,060 --> 01:37:47,118
If you consume two more pegs..

1273
01:37:47,195 --> 01:37:50,460
..Name will no longer be an issue!
Any girl will do.

1274
01:37:51,499 --> 01:37:53,991
I know very well about you guys!

1275
01:37:54,969 --> 01:37:58,462
No matter how many pegs I consume,
you can never become Komali!

1276
01:37:58,539 --> 01:38:00,337
Correct. That is the right thing!

1277
01:38:00,575 --> 01:38:01,974
Have two pegs and prove your love!

1278
01:38:02,009 --> 01:38:02,908
Prove it!

1279
01:38:02,977 --> 01:38:04,968
- I am not in a mood!-
Are you not in a mood?

1280
01:38:05,079 --> 01:38:07,241
Play an old song.
Let me see if you get in the mood.

1281
01:38:07,582 --> 01:38:08,310
Four pegs would..

1282
01:38:08,349 --> 01:38:10,215
Oh! You have hit on my weakness.

1283
01:38:11,018 --> 01:38:12,144
Okay! Play the song..

1284
01:38:40,448 --> 01:38:44,385
"Baby Rita. Stop your hunting?"

1285
01:38:44,452 --> 01:38:48,355
"Playing games is his ploy"

1286
01:38:49,023 --> 01:38:54,018
"GANG. Gang. Gang!"

1287
01:38:54,228 --> 01:38:56,959
"Play.. Bang. Bang!"

1288
01:38:59,367 --> 01:39:01,096
"Gang Leader!"

1289
01:39:02,570 --> 01:39:08,100
"Shankar Dada MBBS. Cheer up!"

1290
01:39:08,209 --> 01:39:13,204
"Shankar Dada MBBS. Cheer up!"

1291
01:39:13,247 --> 01:39:17,309
"Shankar Dada MBBS. Cheer up!"

1292
01:39:17,385 --> 01:39:21,219
"Shankar Dada MBBS. Cheer up!"

1293
01:39:21,289 --> 01:39:24,623
"Shankar Dada MBBS. Cheer up!"

1294
01:39:24,725 --> 01:39:28,059
"Shankar Dada MBBS. Cheer up!"

1295
01:39:28,095 --> 01:39:31,065
"Shankar Dada MBBS. Cheer up!"

1296
01:39:31,098 --> 01:39:33,567
"Shankar Dada MBBS. Cheer up!"

1297
01:39:33,634 --> 01:39:36,228
"Shankar Dada MBBS. Cheer up!"

1298
01:39:36,270 --> 01:39:38,602
"Shankar Dada MBBS. Cheer up!"

1299
01:39:38,673 --> 01:39:40,573
"Shankar Dada.."

1300
01:39:41,242 --> 01:39:42,403
My God!

1301
01:39:44,445 --> 01:39:47,073
I boozed for our happiness.

1302
01:39:47,582 --> 01:39:49,346
Whatever people say..

1303
01:39:50,084 --> 01:39:52,576
..Noobody can surpass boss.

1304
01:39:53,254 --> 01:39:54,244
Correct!

1305
01:39:57,258 --> 01:40:00,159
Everyone left. It must be your plan.

1306
01:40:03,331 --> 01:40:05,026
DO you feel anything?

1307
01:40:06,100 --> 01:40:09,798
Tell me. Don't hide it inside.

1308
01:40:12,440 --> 01:40:14,340
No matter how many pegs..

1309
01:40:14,442 --> 01:40:18,504
..I consume, Komali is
different and you are different!

1310
01:40:19,113 --> 01:40:23,448
Even though people like apple,
will they abstain from eating manges?

1311
01:40:24,051 --> 01:40:26,213
Bite once.

1312
01:40:30,057 --> 01:40:31,115
I like you!

1313
01:40:31,192 --> 01:40:34,389
So you are beginning to fall in line!

1314
01:40:34,529 --> 01:40:36,793
Do people booze for nothing?

1315
01:40:40,535 --> 01:40:42,731
Will you drop me to my room?

1316
01:40:43,738 --> 01:40:47,140
I am alone. I am scared!

1317
01:40:49,544 --> 01:40:52,070
Anyway, you like that room very much!

1318
01:41:09,730 --> 01:41:14,691
I need to agree.
I liked him very much.

1319
01:41:15,670 --> 01:41:16,660
Slowly..

1320
01:41:17,572 --> 01:41:20,564
..He must slowly forget Komali..

1321
01:41:21,108 --> 01:41:23,770
..And Sanju must
become mine exclusively!

1322
01:41:23,844 --> 01:41:27,439
Become mine exclusively!

1323
01:41:28,082 --> 01:41:29,447
Komali!

1324
01:41:31,385 --> 01:41:32,511
Komali!

1325
01:41:34,188 --> 01:41:35,519
Why do you still call me Komali?

1326
01:41:35,556 --> 01:41:37,581
Akanka! Say Akanksha.

1327
01:41:37,892 --> 01:41:40,452
If my people back home come to
know about bringing you to my room..

1328
01:41:40,528 --> 01:41:42,519
..They will severe my limbs!

1329
01:41:45,199 --> 01:41:53,630
Severe my limbs..

1330
01:42:03,417 --> 01:42:05,886
Mummy!

1331
01:42:10,891 --> 01:42:12,450
How did I come here?

1332
01:42:15,229 --> 01:42:17,721
Why are you weeping?

1333
01:42:18,733 --> 01:42:19,825
How did I come here?

1334
01:42:19,900 --> 01:42:21,664
How is your dress torn?

1335
01:42:21,802 --> 01:42:23,566
Don't talk as if
you don't know anything!

1336
01:42:23,638 --> 01:42:26,733
You boozed and have entered my room!

1337
01:42:26,907 --> 01:42:29,774
You acted as if you were drunk!

1338
01:42:30,244 --> 01:42:32,736
You slept here.

1339
01:42:33,748 --> 01:42:36,240
Took advantage..- My God!

1340
01:42:36,784 --> 01:42:38,513
Oh, no! Oh, no!

1341
01:42:38,586 --> 01:42:39,485
Oh, no!

1342
01:42:39,620 --> 01:42:42,920
Don't act smart, Sanju!
You need not say anything to me!

1343
01:42:42,957 --> 01:42:47,258
Akanksha! In my inebriety,
I am unable to remember what I did..

1344
01:42:47,294 --> 01:42:49,285
I am sure I ust have done something!

1345
01:42:49,363 --> 01:42:51,855
I am so sorry!
I am so sorry, Akanksha!

1346
01:42:51,932 --> 01:42:53,764
Will your sorry
rectify what happened?

1347
01:42:53,801 --> 01:42:54,927
There is a way out for that.

1348
01:42:55,169 --> 01:42:58,867
If that wrong is repeated,
it will become right.

1349
01:42:58,939 --> 01:42:59,929
Only thing is..

1350
01:43:00,174 --> 01:43:01,938
We should do it exactly.

1351
01:43:02,777 --> 01:43:05,178
Tell me if something goes wrong.

1352
01:43:05,279 --> 01:43:06,303
You remember everything, right?

1353
01:43:06,480 --> 01:43:06,946
Sanju!

1354
01:43:07,281 --> 01:43:08,612
What are you doing? What is this?

1355
01:43:08,649 --> 01:43:11,619
Akanksha!
Anyways we did it last night.

1356
01:43:11,652 --> 01:43:12,847
Let us do it again.

1357
01:43:12,953 --> 01:43:14,717
Please.

1358
01:43:14,789 --> 01:43:16,985
Akanksha, let us repeat last night"

1359
01:43:17,224 --> 01:43:17,884
Enough, Akanksha!

1360
01:43:17,958 --> 01:43:18,948
Help! Help!

1361
01:43:19,326 --> 01:43:22,523
I fall at your feet!
Nothing happened!

1362
01:43:25,733 --> 01:43:27,963
I know that too!
All the time you girls say..

1363
01:43:28,202 --> 01:43:30,671
..'L am raped.
I have become a victim'..

1364
01:43:30,738 --> 01:43:33,230
..And emotionally blackmail men.

1365
01:43:33,374 --> 01:43:34,569
Does a boy ever lament"

1366
01:43:34,642 --> 01:43:36,906
..'I lost my respect.
I have been raped'.

1367
01:43:36,977 --> 01:43:39,742
Have you ever seen a
boy wail and lament like this?

1368
01:43:40,481 --> 01:43:43,542
Why do girls play
with the weakness of men?

1369
01:43:44,351 --> 01:43:45,648
Will you not change?

1370
01:43:45,820 --> 01:43:49,313
Raddy, if you fight with a girl..

1371
01:43:49,390 --> 01:43:51,586
Kings have become paupers..

1372
01:43:51,759 --> 01:43:53,659
And if a woman fights with a man..

1373
01:43:56,330 --> 01:43:57,320
Slop it, girl!

1374
01:43:57,565 --> 01:44:00,330
Wear some clothes.
I am able to see you like this.

1375
01:44:01,769 --> 01:44:02,736
Master!

1376
01:44:03,003 --> 01:44:05,267
How is this location?

1377
01:44:08,843 --> 01:44:11,505
Why did you bring me here, crazy guy?

1378
01:44:11,579 --> 01:44:15,277
If one slips from here,
he is sure to reach the gorge!

1379
01:44:15,349 --> 01:44:16,578
Is it?

1380
01:44:16,784 --> 01:44:17,945
Are you afraid, master? Then?

1381
01:44:18,018 --> 01:44:18,746
Then jump!

1382
01:44:18,853 --> 01:44:20,014
My God!

1383
01:44:23,023 --> 01:44:24,286
What is it?

1384
01:44:24,358 --> 01:44:27,020
If you don't listen to me,
I will give you shock.

1385
01:44:27,261 --> 01:44:28,558
I will listen.

1386
01:44:30,431 --> 01:44:31,296
Go back!

1387
01:44:31,565 --> 01:44:32,691
Go back!

1388
01:44:33,267 --> 01:44:35,031
I say go back!

1389
01:44:36,303 --> 01:44:38,465
When I say go back,
why are you still standing there?

1390
01:44:38,539 --> 01:44:40,029
Don't you step back! - Okay.

1391
01:44:40,274 --> 01:44:41,605
I will give you a shock!
Go back! - Okay!

1392
01:44:41,709 --> 01:44:42,938
Go back! - Okay!

1393
01:44:43,310 --> 01:44:46,041
If I go back again,
I will fall down and die!

1394
01:44:46,080 --> 01:44:47,639
Is it?

1395
01:44:48,716 --> 01:44:49,808
Go back!

1396
01:44:51,085 --> 01:44:52,985
Master! Do you know something?

1397
01:44:53,320 --> 01:44:54,549
What is it?

1398
01:44:56,891 --> 01:44:58,757
What are these sounds?

1399
01:44:58,826 --> 01:45:00,726
I am Kama] Haasalfs fan!

1400
01:45:00,795 --> 01:45:03,594
Oh! So you possess this talent too.

1401
01:45:04,598 --> 01:45:06,589
Master, today you
are my Kama] Haasan!

1402
01:45:06,667 --> 01:45:07,566
Me?

1403
01:45:07,635 --> 01:45:09,000
Come on! Dance!

1404
01:45:09,069 --> 01:45:11,629
If I dance here,
I will fall down and die!

1405
01:45:11,739 --> 01:45:12,831
Dance!

1406
01:45:12,907 --> 01:45:14,671
Okay! I will do it. I will dance!

1407
01:45:14,742 --> 01:45:16,073
Dance!

1408
01:45:27,621 --> 01:45:29,589
"Depict a romantic mood!"

1409
01:45:29,623 --> 01:45:32,684
"Dance is maneuvering the foot!"

1410
01:45:32,760 --> 01:45:35,127
"Dance is Lord Shiva's armor!"

1411
01:45:35,462 --> 01:45:37,829
"Dance is Lord Natraj's
deftness of feet!"

1412
01:45:42,937 --> 01:45:45,429
"It is an exotic music.
Dance is frolic!"

1413
01:45:45,472 --> 01:45:47,964
"It is the ultimate bliss!"

1414
01:45:48,042 --> 01:45:49,840
"Precepts of performance.."

1415
01:45:49,944 --> 01:45:52,777
"..before a forum is honoring them!"

1416
01:45:58,819 --> 01:46:01,481
Gift! Do you want a gift?

1417
01:46:02,790 --> 01:46:05,020
Will you go to Gudiwada
if I give you a gift?

1418
01:46:07,795 --> 01:46:08,990
Who are you?

1419
01:46:09,063 --> 01:46:11,532
Don't you know who I am?

1420
01:46:11,632 --> 01:46:12,963
Why are you giving me a shock?

1421
01:46:14,134 --> 01:46:15,568
I have understood!

1422
01:46:15,703 --> 01:46:19,003
What you need is not music therapy.

1423
01:46:19,073 --> 01:46:20,632
Shock!

1424
01:46:25,646 --> 01:46:27,978
The person in the CCTV is Indian?!

1425
01:46:34,421 --> 01:46:37,083
Is he alive by chance? - No, sir!

1426
01:46:38,692 --> 01:46:40,660
I have a lot of doubts!

1427
01:46:41,996 --> 01:46:42,986
Listen carefully!

1428
01:46:43,063 --> 01:46:45,589
There is a guy called Sanju Raddy!

1429
01:47:08,856 --> 01:47:11,018
Did you believe that if you cover
your face, I will not recognize you?

1430
01:47:11,525 --> 01:47:12,890
Where are you going?

1431
01:47:13,527 --> 01:47:15,518
Akanksha, don't come with me!

1432
01:47:16,030 --> 01:47:17,725
I have something to talk!

1433
01:47:17,898 --> 01:47:20,230
Akanksha, don't disturb me, go

1434
01:47:20,701 --> 01:47:22,032
I have changed my name!

1435
01:47:22,202 --> 01:47:25,103
I am now Komali! I am Bapnese!

1436
01:47:25,773 --> 01:47:28,037
When I talk to you,
why do you look elsewhere!

1437
01:47:28,108 --> 01:47:29,473
For what?

1438
01:47:30,878 --> 01:47:33,142
Akansha, don't trail me. Stay here!

1439
01:47:52,933 --> 01:47:56,767
- Is this the guy? - Yes!

1440
01:47:57,571 --> 01:47:59,733
When I was talking to you,
where did you go?

1441
01:48:00,507 --> 01:48:01,906
I know what you have got to say!

1442
01:48:01,976 --> 01:48:04,741
That doesn't help!
You must understand too!

1443
01:48:05,746 --> 01:48:06,907
I have my own problems!

1444
01:48:06,947 --> 01:48:07,675
Leave me.

1445
01:48:07,748 --> 01:48:09,147
Where are you going?

1446
01:48:10,250 --> 01:48:11,081
Hey!

1447
01:48:11,185 --> 01:48:13,620
Hey, what are you doing?

1448
01:48:14,755 --> 01:48:15,984
Are you mad?

1449
01:48:16,623 --> 01:48:17,181
Hello!

1450
01:48:18,125 --> 01:48:19,149
What?

1451
01:48:19,259 --> 01:48:21,853
Life is not in our hands!

1452
01:48:22,262 --> 01:48:24,253
If it is controlled by us,
it is not life at all!

1453
01:48:25,265 --> 01:48:27,927
Did you ever believe
Komali would die?

1454
01:48:28,302 --> 01:48:30,532
Did we ever think that we would meet?

1455
01:48:31,271 --> 01:48:33,763
I love you so much.
But you don't understand it!

1456
01:48:33,807 --> 01:48:35,605
You talk about problems all the lime!

1457
01:48:35,642 --> 01:48:37,110
Others too have problems!

1458
01:48:37,644 --> 01:48:39,772
Do you know how
much risk I am taking?

1459
01:48:40,047 --> 01:48:41,776
I am a central minister's daughter!

1460
01:48:41,815 --> 01:48:44,284
I'm already engaged to someone else.

1461
01:48:45,119 --> 01:48:47,213
My marriage is planned
after four months.

1462
01:48:47,287 --> 01:48:48,118
This is my situation.

1463
01:48:48,155 --> 01:48:49,953
But I love you so
much and am after you.

1464
01:48:50,024 --> 01:48:52,152
But you don't seem to understand.

1465
01:48:53,527 --> 01:48:55,962
- Are you engaged? - Yes!

1466
01:48:56,030 --> 01:48:58,021
- To whom? - Whoever it may be!

1467
01:49:00,801 --> 01:49:02,132
Will you still marry me?

1468
01:49:02,236 --> 01:49:04,204
- Yes! - What for?

1469
01:49:04,905 --> 01:49:08,068
I have said this so many times.
I love you!

1470
01:49:09,143 --> 01:49:12,340
If we don't go along
with the flow of life..

1471
01:49:12,679 --> 01:49:14,238
..And try to swim
against the current.

1472
01:49:14,548 --> 01:49:16,676
..We will not move an inch forward!

1473
01:49:18,585 --> 01:49:20,917
Raddy! I am talking to you!

1474
01:49:28,095 --> 01:49:30,894
"Are you an apple
girl or a gilded moon?"

1475
01:49:30,998 --> 01:49:33,365
"Like an ocean wave pearl,
you walk around"

1476
01:49:33,600 --> 01:49:37,093
"I would play the instrument.
Will you sing?"

1477
01:49:42,342 --> 01:49:45,175
"Beloved bird!
Fluttering your pristine wings.."

1478
01:49:45,245 --> 01:49:47,737
"..will you come and
be with him forever?"

1479
01:49:47,848 --> 01:49:50,943
"In a misty month,
come to move around in a chariot!"

1480
01:50:08,368 --> 01:50:13,863
"Come on, my darling!
Let us build a nest far off!"

1481
01:50:13,941 --> 01:50:19,812
"Can sing and dance forever!
Can sing!"

1482
01:50:19,880 --> 01:50:25,216
"Are you the King?
Are your nights mine forever?"

1483
01:50:25,252 --> 01:50:28,244
"Can sing and dance forever!
Can sing!"

1484
01:50:28,322 --> 01:50:31,053
"Can sing and dance forever!
Can sing!"

1485
01:50:31,091 --> 01:50:36,052
"Malgova Mango!
You are my golden flower!"

1486
01:50:36,730 --> 01:50:39,722
"Chocolate boys! Don't ogle me!"

1487
01:50:39,766 --> 01:50:42,633
"He will be with her always!"

1488
01:50:42,736 --> 01:50:45,296
"Will sing and dance forever
in the invisible palace!"

1489
01:50:45,405 --> 01:50:48,272
"Will sing and dance forever
in the glitter of towers!"

1490
01:50:48,342 --> 01:50:51,243
"Will sing and dance
forever in the love den!"

1491
01:50:51,278 --> 01:50:54,737
"Forever.
Forever. Will sing and dance!"

1492
01:51:17,871 --> 01:51:20,772
"Are you an apple
girl or a gilded moon?"

1493
01:51:20,807 --> 01:51:23,276
"Like an ocean wave pearl,
you walk around!"

1494
01:51:23,343 --> 01:51:26,313
"I would play the instrument.
Will you sing?"

1495
01:51:26,380 --> 01:51:29,111
"During summer, you are buttermilk."

1496
01:51:29,283 --> 01:51:32,116
"During winter, you are coffee!"

1497
01:51:32,152 --> 01:51:34,450
"Between us, when we meet.."

1498
01:51:34,488 --> 01:51:37,890
"..a chariot carrying melodic
tunes rides in my heart always!"

1499
01:51:37,958 --> 01:51:40,689
"I am a nocturnal
jasmine before you!"

1500
01:51:40,794 --> 01:51:43,456
"You can even overcome Jacky Chan!
You are a super man!"

1501
01:51:43,697 --> 01:51:46,291
"You have mesmerised me."

1502
01:51:46,333 --> 01:51:49,325
"To become a part of you,
I have come!"

1503
01:51:49,469 --> 01:51:55,169
"Come on, my darling! Will
you not be the lamp to edify me?"

1504
01:51:55,242 --> 01:52:00,806
"Are you the King? You will
kneel down when you face me!"

1505
01:52:00,847 --> 01:52:03,714
"Will sing and dance forever!
Can jump in joy like a butterﬂy!"

1506
01:52:03,817 --> 01:52:06,752
"Will sing and dance forever!
Can hum the tunes!"

1507
01:52:06,820 --> 01:52:08,379
"Will sing and dance forever!"

1508
01:52:08,488 --> 01:52:13,255
"Between us forever.
Forever. Let's sing and dance!"

1509
01:52:45,192 --> 01:52:48,218
"Do not forget the
games played in childhood!"

1510
01:52:48,295 --> 01:52:51,060
"I would give you love-burger!"

1511
01:52:51,131 --> 01:52:56,535
"Golden bod, I'm the lovey-dovey
who has come to own you!"

1512
01:52:56,937 --> 01:52:59,770
"Are you a cop? I am rowdy!"

1513
01:52:59,873 --> 01:53:02,399
"You can't triumph me!"

1514
01:53:02,576 --> 01:53:04,101
"You may have a gun!"

1515
01:53:04,211 --> 01:53:08,239
"Don't aim your gun
to defeat me, boy!"

1516
01:53:08,482 --> 01:53:14,216
"Come on, my darling!
I welcome you playing flute!"

1517
01:53:14,288 --> 01:53:16,552
"Who are you to host me a feast!"

1518
01:53:16,790 --> 01:53:19,919
"Are you not the expert
trying to woo me?"

1519
01:53:20,060 --> 01:53:22,586
"Forever can sing and
dance in an invisible cage!"

1520
01:53:22,829 --> 01:53:25,821
"Forever can sing and
dance marrying you, girl!"

1521
01:53:25,899 --> 01:53:28,493
"Forever can sing and dance
and climb unexplored mounts!"

1522
01:53:28,568 --> 01:53:31,560
"Forever can sing and
dance marrying you, boy!"

1523
01:53:31,605 --> 01:53:34,404
"Always fun and music!"

1524
01:53:34,474 --> 01:53:39,002
"Come on, girl. Come!"

1525
01:53:39,079 --> 01:53:41,275
"Can sing and dance forever!"

1526
01:53:46,853 --> 01:53:49,288
Sir, this came by fax!

1527
01:53:54,294 --> 01:53:55,591
It is him! Him!

1528
01:53:55,629 --> 01:53:58,155
Didn't I say he is stillalive?

1529
01:54:01,101 --> 01:54:02,091
Sir, phone.

1530
01:54:04,271 --> 01:54:06,262
- Hello. - Daddy!

1531
01:54:06,840 --> 01:54:08,467
Daddy, do you like me?

1532
01:54:09,443 --> 01:54:10,933
You are my life, dear.

1533
01:54:11,044 --> 01:54:13,103
Will you fulfill a desire of mine?

1534
01:54:13,280 --> 01:54:17,274
- What do you want, dear? -
I want Sanju!

1535
01:54:25,225 --> 01:54:27,125
Are you crazy?

1536
01:54:27,461 --> 01:54:29,486
You read some book!
Now you say you are in love!

1537
01:54:29,863 --> 01:54:31,297
Don't you know who your daddy is!

1538
01:54:31,365 --> 01:54:32,958
Did you ever think
about his position?

1539
01:54:33,033 --> 01:54:36,025
- Daddy has agreed! -
He has not agreed!

1540
01:54:36,136 --> 01:54:38,366
He was finding it
difficult to decline!

1541
01:54:38,472 --> 01:54:41,169
Besides, you are engaged!

1542
01:54:41,241 --> 01:54:42,675
Don't force me to
a marriage I don't like!

1543
01:54:42,909 --> 01:54:44,968
We fixed it after your consent!

1544
01:54:45,045 --> 01:54:46,979
But I am not interested now.

1545
01:54:47,047 --> 01:54:48,412
If you behave like this..

1546
01:54:48,482 --> 01:54:50,143
..Your dad will hang himself.

1547
01:54:50,250 --> 01:54:53,550
Then I agreed for the
marriage for daddy's sake!

1548
01:54:53,653 --> 01:54:56,145
Now tell daddy to agree for my sake!

1549
01:54:56,223 --> 01:54:58,055
He must agree to it!

1550
01:54:58,158 --> 01:54:59,387
Will everything happen
according to your wish?

1551
01:54:59,493 --> 01:55:01,427
Yes. My wish.

1552
01:55:01,495 --> 01:55:04,157
If you say no,
I will fall under something and die.

1553
01:55:43,203 --> 01:55:45,695
Sanju, I saw Komali!

1554
01:55:46,706 --> 01:55:48,936
What! What!

1555
01:55:50,043 --> 01:55:52,307
Komali is alive! I saw her!

1556
01:55:56,716 --> 01:55:57,706
What are you saying?

1557
01:55:58,285 --> 01:55:59,377
Sanju, I saw her..

1558
01:55:59,453 --> 01:56:02,286
..Crossing my car near the signal!

1559
01:56:06,393 --> 01:56:09,658
Akanksha,
you have never seen Komali before!

1560
01:56:09,963 --> 01:56:11,328
It must be your illusion!

1561
01:56:11,398 --> 01:56:13,230
I did see Komali!

1562
01:56:15,302 --> 01:56:18,135
Don't you understand?
Your Komali is alive!

1563
01:56:19,406 --> 01:56:22,740
You grieve over Komali,
but she is alive!

1564
01:56:26,313 --> 01:56:30,250
I have given you good news!
Why are you blank?

1565
01:56:42,529 --> 01:56:44,122
No, no. No, don't do anything!

1566
01:56:44,197 --> 01:56:45,426
Are you shocked?

1567
01:56:45,765 --> 01:56:48,598
They are the guys
sent by your fiancee!

1568
01:56:49,669 --> 01:56:50,602
What!

1569
01:56:50,637 --> 01:56:52,696
They were sent by your..

1570
01:56:54,374 --> 01:56:56,103
I thought your boss will come!

1571
01:56:56,343 --> 01:56:57,708
Bad luck!

1572
01:57:02,616 --> 01:57:04,516
Why should you wait for my fiancee?

1573
01:57:04,618 --> 01:57:08,452
I am waiting every second
of my life only for him!

1574
01:57:20,133 --> 01:57:22,500
I trapped you for him!

1575
01:57:23,637 --> 01:57:24,570
Trap?

1576
01:57:34,314 --> 01:57:35,645
Are you studying psychology?

1577
01:57:36,149 --> 01:57:37,674
Do you know everything?

1578
01:57:37,751 --> 01:57:39,583
Crap!

1579
01:57:39,753 --> 01:57:40,811
To be precise..

1580
01:57:40,854 --> 01:57:43,687
..Do you know I planted
that diary in your room!

1581
01:57:50,163 --> 01:57:51,494
Do you know I did everything..

1582
01:57:51,531 --> 01:57:53,499
..For you to create
an interest in me?

1583
01:57:53,833 --> 01:57:57,326
I made you trail me only for that!

1584
01:58:26,366 --> 01:58:27,424
Are you done?

1585
01:58:27,534 --> 01:58:29,866
You have sent your goons to kill me?
Do you know who I am?

1586
01:58:30,570 --> 01:58:31,230
Who are you?

1587
01:58:31,304 --> 01:58:33,864
If you want to know so quickly..

1588
01:58:33,907 --> 01:58:36,706
..Ask your brother lying in the
hospital! Ask him. He will tell you.

1589
01:58:37,477 --> 01:58:38,876
Now the girl you are going..

1590
01:58:38,912 --> 01:58:40,710
..To marry is deeply in love with me!

1591
01:58:40,780 --> 01:58:42,544
She wants me to marry her!

1592
01:58:42,616 --> 01:58:44,414
She is plaeding me.
Should I marry her?

1593
01:58:44,484 --> 01:58:46,543
Hey! San] u!

1594
01:58:47,220 --> 01:58:49,382
If I marry her then
the girl is mine..

1595
01:58:49,422 --> 01:58:50,719
..And also the lakh crore rupees..

1596
01:58:50,790 --> 01:58:53,782
..Swindled by you.

1597
01:59:00,500 --> 01:59:01,934
Did you trap me?

1598
01:59:03,803 --> 01:59:04,929
Yes!

1599
01:59:06,172 --> 01:59:07,230
Why?

1600
01:59:15,582 --> 01:59:18,347
'I lied to you that Komali is dead!'

1601
01:59:19,285 --> 01:59:21,845
'She fell unconscious!
I admitted her to a hospital!'

1602
01:59:25,692 --> 01:59:28,627
'Our parents came here in
a good mood to fix our marriage!'

1603
01:59:28,695 --> 01:59:31,528
'They were shattered
seeing her plight!'

1604
01:59:40,440 --> 01:59:42,431
Komali.

1605
01:59:46,346 --> 01:59:47,472
Oh, my God.

1606
01:59:47,847 --> 01:59:49,508
What is all this, sir?

1607
01:59:49,783 --> 01:59:51,478
Those goons have commited the crime.

1608
01:59:51,551 --> 01:59:53,315
They have stabbed
my innocent daughter.

1609
01:59:53,386 --> 01:59:55,548
Don't feel sad!
- What justice is this?

1610
01:59:56,489 --> 01:59:58,389
I will not spare him!

1611
01:59:58,625 --> 01:59:59,956
I know the central
minister very well.

1612
02:00:00,326 --> 02:00:01,691
I will talk to him!

1613
02:00:04,798 --> 02:00:05,629
Hello, Raddy!

1614
02:00:05,665 --> 02:00:09,863
Sir, I have the video of
a murder committed by Shawar!

1615
02:00:10,837 --> 02:00:13,738
For getting that video, they have
stabbed y daughter for no reason.

1616
02:00:13,907 --> 02:00:15,807
We shouldn't spare him at any cost.

1617
02:00:15,909 --> 02:00:18,742
Talk to the Spain officials
immediately. Please .

1618
02:00:19,512 --> 02:00:21,241
- I will do the needful! - Yes, sir!

1619
02:00:25,985 --> 02:00:26,850
Do you know..

1620
02:00:26,986 --> 02:00:29,580
..The murder video is with them!

1621
02:00:30,523 --> 02:00:32,753
That single proof is enough
for everything to crumble down!

1622
02:00:32,826 --> 02:00:34,920
Do something immediately!

1623
02:00:51,945 --> 02:00:54,346
Dad! - Oh!

1624
02:01:18,872 --> 02:01:20,567
Dad!

1625
02:01:25,445 --> 02:01:26,879
My God!

1626
02:01:59,078 --> 02:02:02,412
No!

1627
02:02:28,775 --> 02:02:31,608
'I was in a helpless condition
and couldn't save my family.'

1628
02:02:32,445 --> 02:02:34,777
'They killed everyone
in front of my eyes.'

1629
02:02:39,953 --> 02:02:41,717
'Komali and I were left there.'

1630
02:02:41,788 --> 02:02:44,723
'I was waiting for him since then.'

1631
02:02:46,659 --> 02:02:47,717
From that moment"

1632
02:02:47,794 --> 02:02:49,853
..I was looking for
him in every country!

1633
02:02:59,706 --> 02:03:01,800
In India, your dad acts
as a gentleman before the media.

1634
02:03:01,841 --> 02:03:04,572
He has looted a Iakh crore rupees!

1635
02:03:05,478 --> 02:03:07,970
He is handling the scam money!

1636
02:03:08,381 --> 02:03:09,974
Shawar is your father's
partner in crime.

1637
02:03:10,016 --> 02:03:11,142
Not just this money..

1638
02:03:11,184 --> 02:03:13,152
I will sell India for any amount.

1639
02:03:13,386 --> 02:03:16,913
Not only that, I will get my daughter
married to you. You be with me.

1640
02:03:17,156 --> 02:03:18,715
To prevent him from
cheating your dad..

1641
02:03:18,825 --> 02:03:20,759
..Your dad arranged
your engagement with him!

1642
02:03:20,927 --> 02:03:23,157
Why did you agree? Love?

1643
02:03:23,596 --> 02:03:27,396
No, it was for money! Am I not right?

1644
02:03:29,002 --> 02:03:32,996
That is why your engagement
was secretly held in Paris!

1645
02:03:34,440 --> 02:03:35,839
- Cheers! - Cheers!

1646
02:03:40,413 --> 02:03:41,881
I was present there too!

1647
02:03:43,182 --> 02:03:45,173
But I missed that scoundrel!

1648
02:03:54,527 --> 02:03:56,518
He was trotting the globe..

1649
02:03:56,796 --> 02:04:00,130
..To bring him to this place,
I trapped you!

1650
02:04:00,934 --> 02:04:04,893
That is howl managed
to get his number!

1651
02:04:05,238 --> 02:04:07,229
Later I faxed our photos to him!

1652
02:04:07,473 --> 02:04:09,237
He was highly annoyed.
- Didn't I tell you?

1653
02:04:09,475 --> 02:04:14,037
He is alive. - Now your fiancee
will come here with his men.

1654
02:04:15,548 --> 02:04:18,984
Not for you. For your money!

1655
02:04:20,219 --> 02:04:22,483
Was that diary a fake one?

1656
02:04:27,560 --> 02:04:29,050
That diary is real!

1657
02:04:29,929 --> 02:04:31,920
What is written there is also true!

1658
02:04:32,799 --> 02:04:34,563
Our love too was true!

1659
02:04:34,901 --> 02:04:36,630
And my enmity is also true!

1660
02:04:37,904 --> 02:04:39,269
Where is Komali?

1661
02:05:05,932 --> 02:05:06,922
Hi.

1662
02:05:09,302 --> 02:05:10,770
What?

1663
02:05:19,012 --> 02:05:20,605
He is your brother-in-law!

1664
02:05:20,780 --> 02:05:22,270
He missed the engagement!

1665
02:05:22,515 --> 02:05:23,277
See him now!

1666
02:05:25,018 --> 02:05:27,316
- Hey! - You can't wake
him by tapping!

1667
02:05:27,553 --> 02:05:28,645
He is in coma!

1668
02:05:28,721 --> 02:05:30,655
Get up! Your sister-in-law has come!

1669
02:05:30,723 --> 02:05:32,122
Get up, man.

1670
02:05:32,325 --> 02:05:33,224
No!

1671
02:05:35,061 --> 02:05:37,155
- Get up, man! - No.

1672
02:05:37,230 --> 02:05:40,723
Let me see if I can make him get up!

1673
02:05:42,035 --> 02:05:43,161
What are you doing?

1674
02:05:43,236 --> 02:05:44,897
What are you doing?

1675
02:05:54,313 --> 02:05:57,806
My God! My hand!

1676
02:05:58,151 --> 02:06:01,985
Look at me! Do you know me?

1677
02:06:02,021 --> 02:06:04,319
Where is that money?
Will you not come out?

1678
02:06:04,657 --> 02:06:06,716
I will make you come out with it!

1679
02:06:08,761 --> 02:06:12,561
Listen carefully. You will
not stay alive to hear again.

1680
02:06:12,732 --> 02:06:15,030
If you tell me where the money is,
you will go there.

1681
02:06:15,101 --> 02:06:17,001
Or else everyone will go to god.

1682
02:06:17,170 --> 02:06:18,569
Do you want money or god?

1683
02:06:19,739 --> 02:06:22,265
Money.. Money.. I will tell you.

1684
02:06:32,218 --> 02:06:34,846
Hey, This is Sanju Redy!

1685
02:06:36,122 --> 02:06:37,180
I am taking your brother
and your would-be..

1686
02:06:37,256 --> 02:06:38,849
..To the place where
the money is kept!

1687
02:06:39,092 --> 02:06:41,959
You want all the
three and I want you!

1688
02:06:42,261 --> 02:06:44,252
Come with my girlfriend to the spot!

1689
02:06:51,704 --> 02:06:53,365
Are you people so dauntless?

1690
02:06:53,706 --> 02:06:55,196
Are you people trying
to blackmail me?

1691
02:06:55,274 --> 02:06:59,302
- If I kill you now.. -Will you
be able to do it?

1692
02:06:59,378 --> 02:07:00,903
First of all,
I feel like killing you

1693
02:07:00,980 --> 02:07:02,812
Will you kill me?

1694
02:07:05,418 --> 02:07:06,715
I am ready!

1695
02:07:08,955 --> 02:07:09,979
Kill me!

1696
02:08:17,957 --> 02:08:18,947
Go and check.

1697
02:09:32,365 --> 02:09:35,767
I was waiting for this moment!

1698
02:09:36,535 --> 02:09:40,472
Blood has crossed the boiling point!
Come on, guy!

1699
02:09:41,040 --> 02:09:42,201
What will you do?

1700
02:09:42,875 --> 02:09:44,036
What will you do?

1701
02:09:47,446 --> 02:09:49,039
This is no time to talk.

1702
02:09:49,315 --> 02:09:53,411
Whatever I want to say,
I will say only after killing you!

1703
02:10:30,289 --> 02:10:31,848
Why do you laugh?

1704
02:10:33,025 --> 02:10:37,326
You have brought all
those who tormented my family.

1705
02:10:37,863 --> 02:10:41,163
I love you! Thank you, man!

1706
02:10:42,968 --> 02:10:44,265
Hey, are you the same people?

1707
02:10:44,637 --> 02:10:46,105
Tell me it is you.

1708
02:10:47,206 --> 02:10:49,140
Tell me that it was you then.

1709
02:11:00,286 --> 02:11:01,447
Where is the money?

1710
02:11:01,520 --> 02:11:04,046
It is here! First kill him!

1711
02:11:43,529 --> 02:11:45,520
You were engaged to me..

1712
02:11:45,664 --> 02:11:47,996
..But are you entertaining him?

1713
02:11:50,169 --> 02:11:51,227
First try to kill him!

1714
02:11:51,337 --> 02:11:53,066
- Is she not sister-in-law? -
Sister-in-law!

1715
02:11:53,239 --> 02:11:56,174
If we give her the entire money,
she will elope with him.

1716
02:11:58,077 --> 02:12:00,011
Don't disturb me.

1717
02:12:00,246 --> 02:12:01,611
You..

1718
02:12:11,457 --> 02:12:13,926
Kill them, Sanju!

1719
02:12:34,079 --> 02:12:36,207
No one should be left out!

1720
02:13:10,983 --> 02:13:12,644
Kill them, Sanju!

1721
02:13:16,422 --> 02:13:20,359
- Where is the money? - Come!

1722
02:13:31,504 --> 02:13:33,666
Hey, brother! Hey!

1723
02:14:00,132 --> 02:14:02,464
Where's the money?

1724
02:14:04,203 --> 02:14:07,468
We can talk later. Now you come here!

1725
02:14:29,161 --> 02:14:30,185
Come on!

1726
02:14:31,830 --> 02:14:33,525
Where's the money?

1727
02:14:40,205 --> 02:14:41,366
Come on, man!

1728
02:14:55,854 --> 02:14:57,515
Are you crazy?

1729
02:15:01,093 --> 02:15:02,356
Kill him!

1730
02:15:10,869 --> 02:15:13,270
Tell me, where is the money?

1731
02:15:13,539 --> 02:15:15,633
Tell me! I said tell me!

1732
02:15:15,774 --> 02:15:16,707
Talk, man!

1733
02:15:18,310 --> 02:15:19,573
I say talk, man!

1734
02:15:20,646 --> 02:15:24,480
I will not. Don't even expect that!

1735
02:15:24,650 --> 02:15:26,448
I will kill her!

1736
02:15:31,290 --> 02:15:33,554
Are you scaring me?

1737
02:15:33,592 --> 02:15:36,425
Then all of us will die!

1738
02:15:37,630 --> 02:15:40,793
Sanju, it is okay if I die..

1739
02:15:41,400 --> 02:15:42,925
Go from here quickly!

1740
02:16:24,209 --> 02:16:26,940
Please save me!

1741
02:16:27,446 --> 02:16:30,279
I don't want any money!
Please save me!

1742
02:16:49,368 --> 02:16:51,962
Thank you so much, man! Thank you!

1743
02:16:53,539 --> 02:16:55,564
I don't want to take
a chance with your death.

1744
02:16:55,641 --> 02:16:58,702
That is why I helped you to climb!

1745
02:17:08,554 --> 02:17:11,751
Now tell me what you wanted to say.

1746
02:17:19,665 --> 02:17:20,894
Speak, man!

1747
02:17:43,722 --> 02:17:46,020
Minister is arrested in coal scam.

1748
02:17:47,960 --> 02:17:50,793
I feltproud for studying psychology.

1749
02:17:50,863 --> 02:17:53,264
But I could not study him!

1750
02:17:55,033 --> 02:17:57,058
He first cheated me using that diary!

1751
02:17:57,302 --> 02:17:58,861
He has killed my fiancee.

1752
02:17:58,904 --> 02:18:00,872
He sent my daddy behind bars!

1753
02:18:00,906 --> 02:18:02,533
Your job is done!

1754
02:18:02,574 --> 02:18:04,542
Now you are catching
fishes here happily.

1755
02:18:04,610 --> 02:18:07,409
Akanksha!
I did all these out of revenge..

1756
02:18:07,713 --> 02:18:09,408
..But not deliberately.

1757
02:18:10,449 --> 02:18:12,417
It seems you are taking
revenge against me.

1758
02:18:12,951 --> 02:18:15,977
I understand your
pain for being a girl!

1759
02:18:17,589 --> 02:18:19,785
No point in understanding that!

1760
02:18:23,295 --> 02:18:26,560
Are you both going to marry now?

1761
02:18:26,999 --> 02:18:28,489
Yes.

1762
02:18:29,067 --> 02:18:31,001
Do you want to live
together until you die?

1763
02:18:31,436 --> 02:18:33,564
Will you not have
fights and break up!

1764
02:18:33,939 --> 02:18:35,338
Why should we break up?

1765
02:18:36,408 --> 02:18:38,502
I have seen so many families.

1766
02:18:38,644 --> 02:18:40,738
Will not not break up?
Will I not make entry?

1767
02:18:41,680 --> 02:18:43,079
What are you saying?

1768
02:18:47,419 --> 02:18:49,080
Haven't you understood?

1769
02:18:49,621 --> 02:18:51,316
There is a second part for this!

1770
02:18:51,490 --> 02:18:53,083
I will come again.

1771
02:18:57,796 --> 02:18:59,093
What does she mean by that?

1772
02:18:59,464 --> 02:19:01,990
Let her come.
It will be good with two girls.

1773
02:19:02,768 --> 02:19:08,798
"Come on, my darling!
Let us build a nest far off!"

1774
02:19:08,874 --> 02:19:14,779
"Can sing and dance forever!
Can sing!"

1775
02:19:14,813 --> 02:19:20,343
"Are you the King?
Are your nights mine forever?"

1776
02:19:20,452 --> 02:19:25,947
"Can sing and dance forever!
Can sing!"

1777
02:19:25,991 --> 02:19:30,792
"Malgova Mango!
You are my golden flower!"

1778
02:19:31,730 --> 02:19:34,563
"Chocolate boys! Don't ogle me!"

1779
02:19:34,633 --> 02:19:37,466
"He will be with her always!"

1780
02:19:37,502 --> 02:19:40,472
"Will sing and dance forever
in the invisible palace!"

1781
02:19:40,505 --> 02:19:43,566
"Will sing and dance forever
in the glitter of towers!"

1782
02:19:43,642 --> 02:19:46,134
"Will sing and dance
forever in the love den!"

1783
02:19:46,378 --> 02:19:49,814
"Forever.
Forever. Will sing and dance!"

1784
02:20:12,838 --> 02:20:21,906
"Can sing and dance forever!
Can sing!"
