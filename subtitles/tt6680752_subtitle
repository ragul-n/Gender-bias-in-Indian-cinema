And your job is
auctioning things!

10

Will you ever succeed in life?

Dad!

Nice name.

27

Why are you crying when
I asked your name?

28
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,973
Sir, for so many years;

29
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:34,878
no one has ever asked
me my name, Sir.

30
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:36,545
You are the first one.
- Is it?

31

What is this, Sir?

36
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:47,729
You're asking me
where my house is?

37
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:49,625
I will be here only, Sir.

38

Didn't you leave?
Get going!

39
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:53,429
I will take a bus.

40
00:04:53,526 --> 00:04:55,870
That will be more creative!
- How can one be creative in a bus?

41
00:04:56,095 --> 00:04:57,562
Father, come to the front seat.

42
00:04:57,563 --> 00:04:59,372
- Now I'll be creative!
- He is crazy!

43

Money! Money! Money!

44
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,901
- But his innocence is intact!

45
00:05:02,902 --> 00:05:04,575
What are you waiting for'?
Can't you leave?

46
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:06,082
Your transport bus
is about to come.

47

Didn't you understand what he is
waiting for? Give it, Father.

48
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,817
He has been doing
this for a long time!

49
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:18,750
It's high time you made it 500.
- Ya right!

50
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:21,288
Even the government has changed notes!
- Drive carefully!

51
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:25,894
Nice movie, right?

52
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,899
Oh wow! The movie was awesome!

53
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:31,998
Did you see that closing shot?
- No words!

54
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:33,703
- I was bored to death!
- Two coffees!

55
00:05:33,766 --> 00:05:35,905
- What a feel, right?
- The movie is amazing!

56
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:39,417
I hope I can make such
a movie before I die.

57
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:40,712
Such an amazing feeling, right?

58
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:42,941
Oh my God!
- You're going to make movies like this?

59
00:05:42,942 --> 00:05:44,609
If someone starts walking,
he keeps walking!

60
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:46,478
If it's a river, then the
river keeps flowing!

61
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,015
Oh God! It was so boring!
- Dude! Alby!

62

Keep it.

65

asked for are also there!

00:06:03,596 --> 00:06:05,473
- What?
- Mayamohini (Malayalam movie). No?

75
00:06:18,077 --> 00:06:19,644
Director Lijo Jose Pellissery.

76
00:06:19,645 --> 00:06:20,885
Is he an award film director?

77
00:06:23,616 --> 00:06:24,594
Sir!

78
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:30,866
If you become a big director,
can we walk around like this?

79
00:06:31,524 --> 00:06:32,559
We are good with this!

80
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:34,899
Walking around aimlessly?

81
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:36,731
Right?
- Not that!

00:06:38,531 --> 00:06:39,601

Oh God! Isn't that Alby?
- You didn't believe me, right?

116
00:10:07,306 --> 00:10:09,343
God. Alby is with a girl in that photo.
- What is he up to?

117
00:10:09,408 --> 00:10:10,751
There are more!
- Let me see!

118
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:11,845
It must be just friendship.

119
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:14,212
I don't think it's friendship
seeing how he's holding her.

120
00:10:14,213 --> 00:10:15,954
That's all part of friendship now.
- Is it?

121
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:18,052
Is she a Jacobite, Father?
- No way!

122
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:19,795
She's a Catholic!

123
00:10:19,852 --> 00:10:21,058
So that hope is also gone!

124
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:22,893
See this!

125
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:24,859
They have roamed
all around Kochi.

126

There are no more
places left to visit. See!

127
00:10:28,928 --> 00:10:29,906
Pathetic!

128
00:10:30,396 --> 00:10:32,603
This is such a betrayal!

129
00:10:32,665 --> 00:10:33,643
. Yes!

130
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:35,372
Let him come here.
- Will he come hereafter?

131
00:10:36,702 --> 00:10:37,680
One photo;

132
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:39,170
at least in a group;

133
00:10:39,171 --> 00:10:41,048
there's not even a
single photo of mine!

134
00:10:41,173 --> 00:10:43,278
I'm his mother, right?

135
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:45,982
Chinnamma!
- Let it be, dear.

136
00:10:46,178 --> 00:10:48,681
You can say all that, mom!
He hasn't uploaded my photo!

137
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:51,216
She is sad that her photo isn't there;
not about her son going wayward!

138
00:10:51,217 --> 00:10:52,283
She might be sad.

00:10:52,284 --> 00:10:53,888
<i>I always had</i> this doubt, <i>Kariyachan!</i>

140
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:56,793
That's why I asked you to investigate.
- That was a good idea!

141
00:10:58,758 --> 00:11:02,433
I have dreamt of him speaking
to Iakhs at the Convention;

142
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:03,970
with a beard <i>and a cap.</i>

143
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:07,907
There hasn't been a single night where I
have let him sleep without advising him!

144
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,440
Even then?

145
00:11:10,936 --> 00:11:13,177
- It is all in a mess.
- Father!

Don't be tensed.

The Lord is with us.

149
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:23,083
We shall guide him to the right path.
- Guide whom? The Lord?

150
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:24,895
Don't say that, Vellani Father.

151
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:26,484
Our boy is a gem!

152
00:11:26,485 --> 00:11:28,420
It's true that he went
behind a Catholic girl.

153
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:30,162
And I heard that's been
going on 4-5 years.

154
00:11:30,222 --> 00:11:31,322
Get them married!

155
00:11:31,323 --> 00:11:33,234
Anyway, she is a Christian, right?

156
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:34,771

- No!

Hey! Over here!

159
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:41,106
I heard that the girl's father
is a big gun in Mattanchery.

160
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:43,738
Make sure that you don't end up in the
trap that you laid for him, Father.

161
00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:45,470
Ya right!
Let him come here!

162
00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:47,314
- Why?
- I will crush him!

163
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:49,182

00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:46,901
Let his bones break! Bloody loser!
- Poor guy!

179
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:50,171
He has just applied for a VISA, and he's
already calling himself Italian Gonz!

180
00:12:50,369 --> 00:12:52,349
My dad's selection!
- What selection?

181
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:53,974
He is really short, right?

182
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:01,387
I am not that short, by the way!

183
00:13:01,847 --> 00:13:02,882
Leave me!

184
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:04,487
Oh my God!

185
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:08,832
Daddy!

186
00:13:09,555 --> 00:13:10,795
I saw her, daddy!

187
00:13:11,223 --> 00:13:12,201
I saw her!

188
00:13:13,092 --> 00:13:15,094
I'm scared if that monkey
will put us in trouble!

189
00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:17,037
If my dad comes to know about
this, we will be in real trouble!

190
00:13:17,096 --> 00:13:18,336
Hey! That won't happen!

191
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:20,509
Anyway, all of them have to
know it some day or the other.

192
00:13:20,566 --> 00:13:23,012
And the day they know it, there
will be fireworks for sure!

193
00:13:23,235 --> 00:13:26,307
I have a doubt that my dad
has a clue about us.

194
00:13:26,572 --> 00:13:29,553
There's something fishy about
everyone's behaviour at home.

195
00:13:29,608 --> 00:13:30,985
Oh God! Will it be problem?

196
00:13:31,043 --> 00:13:32,078
Hey! No problem!

197
00:13:32,344 --> 00:13:33,945
We shall convince them!

198
00:13:33,946 --> 00:13:36,017
If they don't agree, I will leave
my house <i>&</i> come with you!

199
00:13:36,081 --> 00:13:37,082
No need of that!

200
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:38,387
We'll make them agree!

201
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:41,252
Whoever comes, I'll hold my head
high and say that you're my girl!

202
00:13:41,253 --> 00:13:42,487
Really?
- Of course!

203
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:43,466
You're my darling!

204
00:13:44,924 --> 00:13:45,924
Hold tight!

205
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:46,903
Okay!

206
00:13:49,428 --> 00:13:51,066
Oh dear God!
We're trapped!

207
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:53,231
Hold your head high <i>&</i> say that
you will marry only me, okay?

208
00:13:53,232 --> 00:13:54,233
Alby!
. Hey!

209
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,504
Stop, I say!

210
00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:57,471
- Go fast!
- Stop!

211
00:13:57,636 --> 00:13:58,614
What do we do?

212
00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:00,245
Stop it, I say!

213
00:14:00,372 --> 00:14:01,817
Stop!

214
00:14:01,874 --> 00:14:03,141
Sarah, where do we go?

215
00:14:03,142 --> 00:14:05,247
I've played many such games.
Don't mess with me!

216
00:14:05,644 --> 00:14:07,378
Where did this lorry come from?

217
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:08,947
- Are you going to heaven?
- Fast!

218
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:09,926
- Oh God!

219
00:14:10,316 --> 00:14:13,151
Stamp on it! Not on me!
On the accelerator!

220
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:14,631
Oh my God!

221
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,231
Everything is screwed!

222
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:30,276
Hello Fathers!

223
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:33,479
Which Father among
you is his father?

224
00:14:33,672 --> 00:14:35,310
Don't raise your hand!
- It's me!

225
00:14:36,108 --> 00:14:37,086
That's it!

226
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:40,119
Just a minute.
- Go! Go get it!

227
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:42,317
Look straight!

228
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:45,928
Oh God!

229
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:48,621
If the fight starts,
fight until death!

230
00:14:49,521 --> 00:14:51,523
Didn't you learn Karate
at the seminary?

231
00:14:51,657 --> 00:14:53,500
No! I learned Yoga!

232
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:57,232
Then take a deep breath
before getting beaten up!

233
00:14:57,529 --> 00:14:59,372
Oh! All of them are black belts?

234
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:17,658
God has listened to our prayers.

235
00:15:18,017 --> 00:15:20,156
I knew that it will end
up only like this.

236
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:21,323
Come here, dears.

237
00:15:21,987 --> 00:15:22,965
Come!

238
00:15:23,622 --> 00:15:24,965
Come!
- Come fast.

239
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:28,071
Well, I'm saying
this to both of you;

240
00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:32,334
just because you
both are in love,

241
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:35,533
we're not ready to fight in the
name of our communities and lineage.

242
00:15:35,534 --> 00:15:36,512
Right Father?

243
00:15:37,002 --> 00:15:38,002
That's it!

244
00:15:38,003 --> 00:15:40,176
Then why did he come here
wearing those sunglasses?

245
00:15:41,173 --> 00:15:43,016
So, we have taken a decision.

246
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:45,254
My dear children,

247
00:15:45,377 --> 00:15:48,688
we will not let your wedding
happen at any cost!

248
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,027
Phew! I mistook him!

249
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:54,096
You,

250
00:15:54,186 --> 00:15:55,392
Come here, you puny.

251
00:15:55,721 --> 00:15:58,600
This guy. This gon..
This gun..

252
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:02,071
What's your name?
Who gave you this name?

253
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:03,227
Whatever it may be!

254
00:16:03,228 --> 00:16:04,673
This son of a gun will marry you!

255
00:16:07,566 --> 00:16:09,968
He will get his Visa
to Italy next month.

256
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:11,642
One month after that,
you will marry him.

257
00:16:12,438 --> 00:16:13,416
Understood?

258
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:18,046
You're supposed to be going
to the land of the Pope.

259
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:19,214
What are you looking at?

260
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:21,087
I will chop you into pieces!

261
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:22,358
You heard me?

262
00:16:22,614 --> 00:16:24,150
Father, continue.

263
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:27,051
What have you seen in him?
- Exactly!

264
00:16:27,052 --> 00:16:28,720
You want to be with
this jobless fellow?

265
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:30,154
How are you going to live?

266
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:31,657
- Correct!
- Poor fellow!

267
00:16:32,691 --> 00:16:35,137
You <i>&</i> your bloody cinema <i>&</i> love story.

268
00:16:35,227 --> 00:16:37,264
At least, let this
girl have a good life.

269
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:40,009
Go! Get into the car!

270
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:42,011
Hey!

271
00:16:42,301 --> 00:16:44,008
This is my final warning!

272
00:16:44,436 --> 00:16:46,143
I won't consider that you're his son.

273
00:16:46,238 --> 00:16:47,805
If you meet her again,

274
00:16:47,806 --> 00:16:50,787
have you seen the Santa Claus being
burnt for New Year in Fort Kochi?

275
00:16:51,076 --> 00:16:52,146
Have you seen it?

276
00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:54,085
I will burn you like that!

277
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:55,157
Got it?

278
00:16:55,547 --> 00:16:57,049
Hey! Get into the car!

279
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,254
What are you waiting for'?

280
00:16:59,818 --> 00:17:01,024
He will kill me.

281
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:11,105
No one is going to touch you.

282
00:17:11,163 --> 00:17:12,267
- Punch dialogue?

283
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:14,372
I won't let them touch you!

284
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:18,581
Come!

285
00:17:20,305 --> 00:17:21,283
Alby!

286
00:17:24,276 --> 00:17:26,278
What will I tell the Pope, daddy?
- Pope?

287
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:27,448
Why are you shaking your hands?

288
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:29,457
They're shivering, not shaking!
See if your dad is following us!

289
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:31,653
I won't look! You look!
- Look, dear! Please!

290
00:17:32,351 --> 00:17:33,625
Shouldn't we take the scooter?

291
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:36,833
I'm trying to scoot from here
somehow, and you want the scooter?

292
00:17:37,156 --> 00:17:38,499
Where are we going?
- I don't know!

293
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:39,602
- Huh?
- Come!

294
00:17:39,691 --> 00:17:40,795
Look at them going!

295
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:16,194
Even though it took some time,
I finished writing it.

296
00:18:16,195 --> 00:18:18,641
Finished?
- Two heroes <i>& a</i> heroine.

297
00:18:18,797 --> 00:18:20,708
Listen to it.
- Go ahead!

298
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:23,679
Alby, today's plan is
not going to happen.

299
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:26,578
Gosh! Kannetta, don't say that.

300
00:18:26,672 --> 00:18:27,705
I'm almost there.

301
00:18:27,706 --> 00:18:28,707
What to do, Alby?

302
00:18:28,874 --> 00:18:30,717
The producer has some other plan.

303
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:32,543
He said he will meet you some other time.

304
00:18:32,544 --> 00:18:34,251
It's been 3-4 years, Kannetta.

305
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:36,681
So many people have
been cancelling plans.

306
00:18:36,682 --> 00:18:38,182
This is Cinema, Alby.

307
00:18:38,183 --> 00:18:39,717
You have to wait
for a long time.

308
00:18:39,718 --> 00:18:41,254
Sing that song in the meanwhile.

309
00:18:41,653 --> 00:18:46,124
'I kept on waiting'

310
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:48,100
Will I turn into a Moideen, Kannetta?
- Hey,

311
00:18:48,193 --> 00:18:49,570
you've waited for so long, right?

312
00:18:49,728 --> 00:18:51,298
Now wait a little more.

313
00:18:51,396 --> 00:18:52,374
Okay.

314
00:18:56,201 --> 00:18:57,839
She was standing
at the bus stop.

315
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:00,377
And exactly like he promised,
- Bro, one soda sarbath.

316
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:02,281
He reached there at 4 o'clock.

317
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:05,910
As soon as she saw him, she
became possessed with love,

318
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:08,482
looked at him and smiled shyly.

319
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:09,580
That's awesome!

320
00:19:09,581 --> 00:19:11,891
Her desire to reach him
kept on increasing!

321
00:19:12,284 --> 00:19:14,855
As soon as she stepped
forward to cross the road,

322
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,127
a lorry came rushing towards her.

323
00:19:17,222 --> 00:19:18,256
Did she die, bro?

324
00:19:18,257 --> 00:19:20,258
Get lost, you swine! She didn't die!
- Then?

325
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:22,671
Suddenly she heard the horn
of a red car behind her.

326
00:19:22,761 --> 00:19:25,799
Inside that, there was an old lover
of hers, who she had ditched - Tomy.

327
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:28,269
She is perplexed.

328
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,601
One one side, is her new lover and
on the other side, her old lover.

329
00:19:30,602 --> 00:19:32,436
But they both haven't seen each other.
- This will be a super hit.

330
00:19:32,437 --> 00:19:33,677
Who are the heroes?

331
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,284
Fahadh <i>&</i> Dulquer.

332
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:37,581
I should definitely watch it.

333
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:39,747
They both come together
only forAsianet awards.

334
00:19:39,878 --> 00:19:42,381
If you shoot it then, it will happen.

335
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:49,463
Bro, this is soda with salt.

336
00:19:49,621 --> 00:19:51,259
I asked for a soda sarbath.

337
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:53,234
Salt?
You wanted a sarbath?

338
00:19:53,725 --> 00:19:56,262
Oh God, you're giving me
everything except what I ask for.

339
00:19:58,964 --> 00:19:59,942
Who is that?

340
00:20:05,404 --> 00:20:06,382
Namaste, Sir.

341
00:20:06,772 --> 00:20:07,750
Jabban

342
00:20:07,806 --> 00:20:09,473
How is my new shirt?
- Very nice.

343
00:20:09,474 --> 00:20:10,452
Is it?

344
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:12,546
I got it stitched at Um malkka's shop.
- Is it? - Ya.

345
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:14,745
So it's not ready-made?
- I don't like ready-made.

346
00:20:14,746 --> 00:20:16,487
But this, he stitches it
according to our choice.

347
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:18,858
He used to stitch shirts
for the Sheikh in Dubai.

348
00:20:19,851 --> 00:20:22,297
The Sheikh won't wear shirts unless
Um maikka stitches them for him.

349
00:20:22,421 --> 00:20:25,402
But usually, the Sheikhs
wear robes, right?

350
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:27,725
Is that why this
is a little long?

351
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:29,296
No. It's not long.

352
00:20:29,428 --> 00:20:30,873
You feel so because
you are short.

353
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:33,631
Is that so? I got scared!
- One minute!

354
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:34,610
Sir!

355
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:36,407
This is going to be a problem.

356
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:38,747
Ya.

357
00:20:39,671 --> 00:20:41,241
I am the boss or
you are the boss?

358
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:42,478
You listen to what I say!

359
00:20:43,342 --> 00:20:44,320
Ya.

360
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:47,022
Ya.
- Red car, Sir.

361
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:48,324
One sec.

362
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:50,520
Whose car parking is this?

363
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:51,560
Yours, Sir.

364
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:52,685
Whose car is this then?

365
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:55,319
Sir, this belongs to some
guest who came to C-2.

366
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,663
I thought you won't be coming now.

367
00:20:56,722 --> 00:20:58,668
Do you decide when I
should come or not?

368
00:20:58,857 --> 00:21:00,461
- No, Sir.
- Call them & clear the car.

369
00:21:00,525 --> 00:21:01,799
That's correct, Sir.

370
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:03,804
Go call them, I say!
- I am the coming, Sir.

371
00:21:03,895 --> 00:21:05,568
- Will he burn that car?

372
00:21:06,832 --> 00:21:07,810
Gosh! This guy?

373
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:10,679
Are you back from a
wedding or what?

374
00:21:10,869 --> 00:21:12,246
With a white shirt?

375
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:15,339
Wedding? - I got it stitched from
Ummarka's shop. Nice, right?

376
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,842
- Great.
- Don't you have a uniform?

377
00:21:16,908 --> 00:21:18,478
I didn't wear it.
I'll wear it now.

378
00:21:18,844 --> 00:21:19,910
Security, it seems.

379
00:21:19,911 --> 00:21:21,746
None of you are at the gate!
- That's true.

380
00:21:21,747 --> 00:21:23,727
- Are you happy now?
- Do you wanna play, Alby?

381
00:21:24,316 --> 00:21:26,853
Yea! Now kick it and break
the glass of the car.

382
00:21:26,918 --> 00:21:28,556
Don't you have any
other place to play?

383
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,427
Go <i>&</i> play outside!
- Get lost, you dog!

384
00:21:30,689 --> 00:21:31,997
Hey! Where did they go?

385
00:21:32,057 --> 00:21:33,058
I wanted to meet you.

386
00:21:33,325 --> 00:21:36,738
I went to C-2, thinking you would be there.
But I couldn't find you there.

387
00:21:39,865 --> 00:21:41,367
Here's your prey.
Go ahead!

388
00:21:42,534 --> 00:21:44,445
He's an innocent chap, Sir.
He'll move it now.

389
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:48,317
Sir.

390
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,914
Can you move your car?

391
00:21:50,342 --> 00:21:51,320
He will leave.

392
00:21:54,513 --> 00:21:56,781
Do you have the numbers and
cards of people who come here?

393
00:21:56,782 --> 00:21:58,887
You wouldn't know even if some
ISS terrorists land up here.

394
00:21:59,017 --> 00:22:01,793
Ya right! As if ISS terrorists
come with visiting cards!

395
00:22:06,425 --> 00:22:08,871
I don't want things like this
happening in this flat ever again!

396
00:22:08,927 --> 00:22:11,028
A huge failure, Sir.
- What?

397
00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:12,007
That guy!

398
00:22:12,064 --> 00:22:13,764
He just has a big body;
no brains at all!

399
00:22:13,765 --> 00:22:15,039
All of you are the same!

400
00:22:18,737 --> 00:22:19,715
This is also not working!

401
00:22:19,771 --> 00:22:20,875
Even the lift is not working?

402
00:22:22,908 --> 00:22:24,854
Yes, Sir. It's networking.
- You bloody.

403
00:22:32,818 --> 00:22:33,796
Hey!

404
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:34,830
You bloody ass!

405
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,498
That's for me!

406
00:22:37,923 --> 00:22:39,095
The lift is networking.

407
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:40,996
Let's walk.
Come!

408
00:22:43,895 --> 00:22:44,896
Aren't you coming?

409
00:22:46,898 --> 00:22:48,809
<i>I will</i> kill that mad dog!

410
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,345
His bloody English;

411
00:22:50,469 --> 00:22:51,709
Don't make me talk further.

412
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:55,639
Has your film started?
- Not yet.

413
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,517
It's still in the discussion stage.
Almost done.

414
00:22:57,609 --> 00:22:59,176
What's there to discuss
so much about?

415
00:22:59,177 --> 00:23:01,487
This discussion has been going
on for 2-3 years, right?

416
00:23:03,648 --> 00:23:04,648
Bloody hell.

417
00:23:04,649 --> 00:23:05,992
One of my office-mates' brother,

418
00:23:06,952 --> 00:23:08,158
he hasn't assisted anyone.

419
00:23:08,453 --> 00:23:09,761
And now he has
announced his movie.

420
00:23:09,855 --> 00:23:11,391
There wasn't much
discussion for that.

421
00:23:11,456 --> 00:23:13,493
- I remember..
- What's the discussion over here?

422
00:23:13,625 --> 00:23:14,603
Go back home!

423
00:23:16,194 --> 00:23:17,571
What were we discussing?

424
00:23:17,629 --> 00:23:18,733
Ya! Cinema!
- Trapped!

425
00:23:18,797 --> 00:23:21,403
It's like gambling!
Just like buying a lottery ticket.

426
00:23:21,466 --> 00:23:23,776
The winner will be a king and
the loser will be a pauper.

427
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:24,847
It's all fate!

428
00:23:25,504 --> 00:23:27,484
Is the key to the fate
over there or over here?

429
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:28,941
Your key, Sudhi.

430
00:23:29,608 --> 00:23:30,586
I have it.

431
00:23:31,343 --> 00:23:36,343
<i>www.desireleasers.com</i>

432
00:23:57,736 --> 00:23:59,113
Where did this come from?

433
00:24:00,872 --> 00:24:03,182
Can't you lock your doors
while flying, you dog?

434
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:05,019
It was such a nice shirt.

435
00:24:05,544 --> 00:24:06,522
Scoundrel!

436
00:24:07,078 --> 00:24:09,718
How will such guys land
flights responsibly?

437
00:24:10,015 --> 00:24:11,995
- Only a little was left.
- So sad!

438
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:13,824
Are you happy now that
you threw it away?

439
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:16,432
Now there'll be another drama
downstairs because of this!

440
00:24:17,055 --> 00:24:19,501
Hey! If there's any problem,
don't blame me for that.

441
00:24:19,891 --> 00:24:21,700
What's gone is gone!
- What happened?

442
00:24:21,893 --> 00:24:23,260
What's gone is gone!
Don't worry!

443
00:24:23,261 --> 00:24:26,435
Not that. You went to narrate your
story, right? What happened there?

444
00:24:27,199 --> 00:24:29,839
While I was narrating the story,
the producer cried thrice.

445
00:24:30,068 --> 00:24:32,514
And for the comedy scenes,
he was laughing like crazy!

446
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:36,740
Well, last time a producer cried;
he didn't commit the movie, right?

447
00:24:36,741 --> 00:24:39,119
This is not like that. Those were
false tears. This will happen!

448
00:24:39,277 --> 00:24:40,688
Really?
- No doubt!

449
00:24:40,879 --> 00:24:42,279
If not this, something else.
- Huh?

450
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:45,727
If it happens, you wait <i>&</i> watch!
There will be a painting festival here!

451
00:24:46,518 --> 00:24:48,930
We should change these Chinese
items and re-do the whole place.

452
00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:50,165
Over here,

453
00:24:50,555 --> 00:24:52,057
an awesome home theatre!

454
00:24:53,258 --> 00:24:56,467
Instead of this stupid sack, we should
arrange a lovely sofa set here.

455
00:24:56,928 --> 00:24:58,635
And this thing..
All this"...

456
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:01,074
Let Christ be here; rest everything
should be branded items!

457
00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:04,235
In between all that, you'll be
the only local one.

458
00:25:04,236 --> 00:25:05,715
It's okay! <i>I will</i> adjust!

459
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:07,738
Ya right! You needn't adjust!

460
00:25:07,739 --> 00:25:10,908
If I had married that Gonzalves, I would
have been having fun in Italy now.

461
00:25:10,909 --> 00:25:12,149
Yea rig ht!

462
00:25:13,111 --> 00:25:14,089
Darling!
- No.

463
00:25:14,246 --> 00:25:15,281
My day"

464
00:25:15,547 --> 00:25:16,548
Get me a coffee.

465
00:25:17,649 --> 00:25:19,287
What about an Italian Espresso?

466
00:25:20,285 --> 00:25:21,263
Black coffee?

467
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:23,265
There's no milk!
Shall I get it?

468
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:31,906
Don't give whatever I ask for!

469
00:25:33,298 --> 00:25:35,966
I have told Sridevi. I don't
know what their plan is.

470
00:25:35,967 --> 00:25:37,275
Will there be flights
at this time?

471
00:25:37,335 --> 00:25:38,313
Look!

472
00:25:38,637 --> 00:25:40,173
Why is he like a porn star?

473
00:25:40,972 --> 00:25:43,179
Will they fall for me like
in 'Sharapanjaram' (movie)?

474
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:52,528
Hello!

475
00:25:52,951 --> 00:25:54,157
What are you up to?

476
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:56,130
I bought some plants.

477
00:25:56,955 --> 00:25:58,696
To get at least a
little fresh air.

478
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:02,159
Can't you grow some plants there too?
- Ya. Let's see.

479
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,731
If you breathe fresh air,
you will get fresh ideas!

480
00:26:06,665 --> 00:26:07,837
That's not needed.

481
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,542
For Alby, a banana tree would be perfect.
Shall we grow one, Alby?

482
00:26:12,938 --> 00:26:14,178
Go say that to your dad!

483
00:26:16,942 --> 00:26:17,920
Bye.

484
00:26:21,813 --> 00:26:23,019
Good morning.
- Good morning.

485
00:26:23,648 --> 00:26:24,626
What is it?

486
00:26:24,816 --> 00:26:25,920
Very good morning!

487
00:26:26,151 --> 00:26:27,687
Good morning.
- Good morning,Alby.

488
00:26:28,219 --> 00:26:29,323
Colourful place!

489
00:26:30,355 --> 00:26:32,631
Why are you standing there?
Come <i>&</i> sit here.

490
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:33,735
Sit down.

491
00:26:36,294 --> 00:26:37,739
You sat there already?

492
00:26:37,796 --> 00:26:38,774
Sit down, Sir.

493
00:26:40,665 --> 00:26:42,144
Not here. Over there.
On that.

494
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,209
On the sack?
- On this thing?

495
00:26:46,204 --> 00:26:48,150
This is all junk, huh?

496
00:26:51,376 --> 00:26:53,617
What make is this?

497
00:26:53,678 --> 00:26:55,749
We don't see you for our
association meetings.

498
00:26:55,847 --> 00:26:57,758
You keep escaping, you brat!

499
00:26:58,984 --> 00:26:59,928
Sarah.

500
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:01,597
Bring coffee.

501
00:27:03,054 --> 00:27:04,863
Extra sugar for me, please.

502
00:27:04,923 --> 00:27:05,901
Ya rig ht!

503
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:10,603
- You seem to be a little irresponsible
in paying the maintenance fees.

504
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:11,773
No hurry!

505
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:15,742
My dear Lord, multiply this like
you multiplied those five loaves.

506
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,041
How can I give this much to all of them?
Bloody hell!

507
00:27:18,703 --> 00:27:19,773
Have it.
- Thank you.

508
00:27:19,838 --> 00:27:20,816
Welcome.

509
00:27:21,373 --> 00:27:22,373
Black coffee?

510
00:27:22,374 --> 00:27:24,820
Well, Alby doesn't drink
coffee with milk.

511
00:27:24,909 --> 00:27:25,887
He doesn't like it.

512
00:27:25,944 --> 00:27:26,922
Right?
- Yes.

513
00:27:27,112 --> 00:27:30,286
On the 15th of next month, it's our
flat's anniversary celebration.

514
00:27:30,782 --> 00:27:33,729
This is the second celebration
since I became the president.

515
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:36,633
So we're planning a
grand celebration.

516
00:27:36,921 --> 00:27:38,730
There are several
cultural programmes.

517
00:27:39,057 --> 00:27:42,038
Young artists like you
shouldn't be so reclusive.

518
00:27:42,093 --> 00:27:43,902
You should come out there.
- I'll come.

519
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:46,142
Well, you didn't tell
him what we came for.

520
00:27:46,231 --> 00:27:47,335
What's there to say?

521
00:27:47,899 --> 00:27:49,071
He's our guy!

522
00:27:49,267 --> 00:27:51,338
Just give him a
receipt for Rs.2000.

523
00:27:52,771 --> 00:27:54,444
Coughing?
- Shall I go back to the kitchen?

524
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:56,073
Don't get it now.
- No?

525
00:27:56,074 --> 00:27:57,815
You can take your
time and pay it.

526
00:27:57,909 --> 00:28:00,219
Today evening or tomorrow morning.
- Three zeroes.

527
00:28:00,311 --> 00:28:01,449
Pay at your own leisure.

528
00:28:02,147 --> 00:28:03,285
Don't make it late.

529
00:28:05,216 --> 00:28:06,194
Here VOu go!

530
00:28:09,487 --> 00:28:10,966
And one more thing.
- What?

531
00:28:11,389 --> 00:28:13,096
Don't say no.
Please.

532
00:28:13,425 --> 00:28:16,338
We need someone as a Chief
Guest for our programme.

533
00:28:16,961 --> 00:28:20,064
We don't anyone as busy
as Mam mootty or Mohanlal.

534
00:28:20,065 --> 00:28:21,043
That's good.

535
00:28:21,099 --> 00:28:26,139
Even someone like Fahadh Faasil or
DulquerSalman Khan would do.

536
00:28:26,237 --> 00:28:27,307
Prith vi raj!
- Who?

537
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:29,079
Someone among them will be fine,Alby.

538
00:28:29,174 --> 00:28:30,152
No hurry!

539
00:28:30,308 --> 00:28:31,787
But make it fast.
- Yes.

540
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:34,789
We have to print the notice day after.
- I'll try.

541
00:28:34,913 --> 00:28:36,085
Shall we leave then?

542
00:28:36,147 --> 00:28:37,956
Shall we leave then?
- Okay.

543
00:28:38,116 --> 00:28:39,950
Didn't I say the same thing now?
- Even I did.

544
00:28:39,951 --> 00:28:41,485
That's enough for the celebrity
plans to be dropped.

545
00:28:41,486 --> 00:28:42,863
Oops! What's next?

546
00:28:43,088 --> 00:28:44,499
I had to ask something urgently.

547
00:28:45,256 --> 00:28:47,793
If Nivin Pauly acts in a film,
how much does he get?

548
00:28:50,328 --> 00:28:51,306
1 crore?

549
00:28:52,997 --> 00:28:53,975
Thanks!

550
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:55,999
I had a major argument
with my wife.

551
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,139
She said 50 Iakhs
and Isaid 1 crore.

552
00:28:58,369 --> 00:28:59,347
Iwon!

553
00:28:59,437 --> 00:29:00,882
I will finish her today!

554
00:29:01,139 --> 00:29:04,780
'I'm on fire, baby'
'Today I'm on fire, baby'

555
00:29:06,377 --> 00:29:07,355
Subaidar Sir.

557
00:29:17,188 --> 00:29:19,065
Hey!
Done?

558
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:22,962
You're turning into a
vampire these days!

559
00:29:23,962 --> 00:29:25,942
Dude, that girl will
bleed to death!

560
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:28,244
Should I bring a
priest to exorcise you?

561
00:29:28,533 --> 00:29:29,511
No!

562
00:29:34,239 --> 00:29:35,405
Such a nice sight!

563
00:29:35,406 --> 00:29:36,976
Who's that girl in
the Black Churidar?

564
00:29:37,876 --> 00:29:39,014
Hey Babu!

565
00:29:39,377 --> 00:29:40,481
Come here.

566
00:29:41,179 --> 00:29:42,886
What's up with my request?

567
00:29:43,014 --> 00:29:45,516
Chacko Sir, I've told you not to
come to me with such requests.

568
00:29:45,517 --> 00:29:46,894
What would people think?

569
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:49,931
It's because I have
no other option.

570
00:29:50,889 --> 00:29:52,368
I don't need this.
I won't fall for it.

571
00:29:52,423 --> 00:29:53,824
Take it.

572
00:29:53,825 --> 00:29:55,099
Just because you are giving it!

573
00:29:55,393 --> 00:29:57,532
She's on the terrace.

574
00:29:58,396 --> 00:29:59,374
Go there!

575
00:30:00,031 --> 00:30:01,009
Ya rig ht!

576
00:30:01,499 --> 00:30:02,500
What do I do now?

577
00:30:02,567 --> 00:30:04,171
Let me watch the
Oppana for some time.

578
00:30:06,571 --> 00:30:09,381
Uncle, when are you starting your movie?
- Let the sun go down, dear.

579
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,852
Why? You've left your movie
to dry in the sun or what?

580
00:30:14,245 --> 00:30:15,588
Even little kids are
pulling my leg!

581
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:21,057
How come there are so
many shoes outside?

582
00:30:24,122 --> 00:30:25,601
There's something wrong.

583
00:30:27,091 --> 00:30:28,798
Lots of girls.

584
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:32,069
Oh! The father is here!

585
00:30:33,431 --> 00:30:34,466
My dad has come?

586
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:35,805
Not your dad!

587
00:30:35,867 --> 00:30:36,845
This dad!

588
00:30:40,205 --> 00:30:41,980
Just have carrotjuice.

589
00:30:43,541 --> 00:30:45,111
Sarah is feeling pukish.

590
00:30:46,878 --> 00:30:47,856
Pukish?

591
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:50,088
I came to know only
when Jeena told me.

592
00:30:50,148 --> 00:30:51,593
Sarah fainted and fell down.

593
00:30:51,649 --> 00:30:53,322
Luckily I saw that from the balcony.

594
00:30:54,152 --> 00:30:55,893
Take her to the hospital.

595
00:30:55,954 --> 00:30:57,254
And do a test.

596
00:30:57,255 --> 00:30:59,356
What's the need for that?
Don't we know it already?

597
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:01,234
Let them get a
confirmation, Rosamma.

598
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:03,093
Are you still feeling restless, dear?

599
00:31:03,094 --> 00:31:04,266
Slightly, aunfy-

600
00:31:04,329 --> 00:31:05,831
- Take her then!
- Why, dear?

601
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:07,841
I swear!
- Oh God!

602
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:13,442
Phew! Such along queue.

603
00:31:17,408 --> 00:31:18,386
You are next.

604
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:20,420
Wait! Wait!
Where are you going?

605
00:31:20,511 --> 00:31:21,922
I'm Sarah's wife.
Sheesh.

606
00:31:22,013 --> 00:31:23,083
Sarah's husband.

607
00:31:23,248 --> 00:31:24,226
Oh! Sarah Alby.

608
00:31:24,282 --> 00:31:25,488
I called you so many times!

609
00:31:25,617 --> 00:31:27,619
I went there to pay the bill, sister.

610
00:31:27,685 --> 00:31:28,685
Okay. Fine.

611
00:31:28,686 --> 00:31:30,487
Sarah is inside.
You wait outside.

612
00:31:30,488 --> 00:31:32,422
Okay? Sarah will come
now after the test.

613
00:31:32,423 --> 00:31:33,458
Sister!

614
00:31:33,524 --> 00:31:35,526
Well.. lam her actual husband!

615
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:45,540
Cutie.

616
00:31:48,139 --> 00:31:51,643
(Now even the father can witness
the birth of his dear child)

617
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:00,129
You're not able to sit, right?

618
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:03,363
You're not able to sit, right?

619
00:32:03,554 --> 00:32:05,329
Ya.. That's a..
- Difficulty.

620
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:07,631
Ya. It's my first time.
- It's normal.

621
00:32:08,026 --> 00:32:09,664
It's okay. Everything
will be all right.

622
00:32:11,195 --> 00:32:12,173
Brother,

623
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:14,164
I suffered this a lot.

624
00:32:14,165 --> 00:32:15,143
Is it?
- Ya.

625
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,902
How much?
- I don't know.

626
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:18,669
It's quite expensive, right?

627
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:22,117
More than the expense, it's
the pain that's terrible.

628
00:32:23,308 --> 00:32:25,345
And all this is not
because of our fault!

629
00:32:28,046 --> 00:32:31,186
I went on 5 years without
letting anyone know about it.

630
00:32:31,349 --> 00:32:32,987
5 years?
- Of course!

631
00:32:33,051 --> 00:32:34,587
Some would take even more time.

632
00:32:35,086 --> 00:32:36,064
<i>Narayanan'.!</i>

633
00:32:37,422 --> 00:32:38,992
I'll be right back.

634
00:32:39,691 --> 00:32:40,635
Come.

635
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:44,272
But..

636
00:32:49,233 --> 00:32:50,735
(Piles)

637
00:32:51,235 --> 00:32:52,509
Sheesh!

638
00:32:57,275 --> 00:32:58,253
Sir!

639
00:32:59,177 --> 00:33:01,521
Sir, I've been trying to
meet you for a long time.

640
00:33:02,213 --> 00:33:04,090
Kannan Chettan has told
you about me, right?

641
00:33:04,182 --> 00:33:06,116
Alby!
. Oh yes! Alby! Hellol

642
00:33:06,117 --> 00:33:07,755
How are you?
- Fine, sir.

643
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:09,089
Why are you here?

644
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:10,392
My mother had a surgery.

645
00:33:10,455 --> 00:33:11,490
I came for that.

646
00:33:12,023 --> 00:33:14,503
And ya, I'll listen to your story.
Let me get done with all this.

647
00:33:15,526 --> 00:33:17,096
Do you have any
upcoming release, Sir?

648
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:18,139
No releases, man!

649
00:33:18,296 --> 00:33:21,140
But our association is
organizing a Kabaddi match.

650
00:33:21,232 --> 00:33:22,210
After that,

651
00:33:22,266 --> 00:33:25,611
an 'Avial' cooking competition between
our association <i>&</i> directors' association.

652
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:27,149
After that, I'm free.

653
00:33:27,438 --> 00:33:29,306
We'll meet then.
We'll discuss!

654
00:33:29,307 --> 00:33:31,378
Sir, can I narrate the
gist of my story now?

655
00:33:32,377 --> 00:33:33,355
Right now?

656
00:33:34,078 --> 00:33:35,580
We'll do it later.
I'll call you.

657
00:33:35,747 --> 00:33:37,055
I'll definitely call you!

658
00:33:37,749 --> 00:33:40,423
People like you are the
future of Malayalam Cinema.

659
00:33:40,585 --> 00:33:41,996
You should rock!

660
00:33:42,286 --> 00:33:43,526
Carry on then!
Bye.

661
00:33:44,822 --> 00:33:47,098
- Shall we plan the meeting
with Georgettan tomorrow?

662
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:55,343
Oops.

663
00:33:56,134 --> 00:33:57,112
What happened?

664
00:33:58,136 --> 00:33:59,547
What will happen?
Where were you?

665
00:33:59,737 --> 00:34:00,715
Well, I was..

666
00:34:00,805 --> 00:34:01,783
Leave it.

667
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:03,648
What did the doctor say?
- There's nothing!

668
00:34:04,475 --> 00:34:05,545
Huh? Nothing?

669
00:34:06,411 --> 00:34:09,221
It was the effect of that chicken curry
you bought from the mall.

670
00:34:09,313 --> 00:34:11,088
You jumped at the 50%
discount offer, right?

671
00:34:11,182 --> 00:34:12,456
And I also hogged nicely!

672
00:34:12,683 --> 00:34:13,661
Food poison!

673
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:22,659
What?

674
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:24,037
Why are you smiling?

675
00:34:25,296 --> 00:34:26,798
Just think that it's
not time for us yet.

676
00:34:28,132 --> 00:34:29,110
Hey!

677
00:34:29,467 --> 00:34:30,810

- No. Get lost!

Smile!

679

'To turn into damp and tender leaves
on the branches of love, yet again'

703
00:38:08,052 --> 00:38:16,870
'We are flying high on the wings of
the long forgotten songs'

704
00:38:16,994 --> 00:38:21,704
'With lots of desires and pampering,
on this chariot of flowers'

705
00:38:21,766 --> 00:38:25,908
'Let's sleep, enjoying the
flowery breeze as far as we go'

706
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:30,543
'Your every breath would
stay close to my heart'

00:38:30,608 --> 00:38:36,388
'Like the feathers of a lovely
white dove in the morning'

709
00:38:43,587 --> 00:38:44,565
Oh God!

710
00:38:45,423 --> 00:38:46,458
It's from the bank!

711
00:38:48,693 --> 00:38:52,835
Mr.Alby, you are requested to repay
your loan with interest (Rs.93,500)

712
00:38:52,897 --> 00:38:57,676
and get back the gold which you
have mortgaged, within a week.

713
00:38:57,768 --> 00:39:00,840
Failing which, the bank will go
forward with its proceedings.

714
00:39:00,938 --> 00:39:01,916
Wait!

715
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,576
What about our chief guest?

716
00:39:05,609 --> 00:39:07,143
L.. I am trying.

717
00:39:07,144 --> 00:39:08,418
No hurry.

718
00:39:08,713 --> 00:39:09,779
But make it fast!

719
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:11,054
We have to print the notices.

720
00:39:11,949 --> 00:39:13,053
Continue reading.

721
00:39:16,454 --> 00:39:17,990
You have an arrear
of 35000, right?

722
00:39:18,489 --> 00:39:20,435
Including the interest, it
will come up to 42,000.

723
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:22,525
But Sir, I'll pay the interest.
- Excuse me.

724
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:24,096
I want to meet Manager Sir.

725
00:39:25,596 --> 00:39:26,836
Dhananjayan, right?

726
00:39:26,897 --> 00:39:27,875
Sir!

727
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:30,042
Nice name!
- Thank you, Sir.

728
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:32,609
But you can't be associated
with Dhanam (money). - True.

729
00:39:33,471 --> 00:39:35,473
How many times I
sent notices to you?

730
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:37,112
How many phone calls?

731
00:39:37,742 --> 00:39:41,417
While getting the loan, you
were so humble and polite.

732
00:39:41,846 --> 00:39:43,120
After you got the money,

733
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:44,750
you don't need us!
- Sir!

734
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:47,821
Sir, somehow make
it into 6 Iaddoos.

735
00:39:47,918 --> 00:39:49,920
Laddoo?
- Not Laddoo, Sir. Gadu (installments).

736
00:39:49,987 --> 00:39:52,489
If you divide it into six installments,
I will pay it back promptly.

737
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:55,164
You couldn't pay it even
as 60 installments.

738
00:39:55,426 --> 00:39:56,871
And you think you can pay in six?

739
00:39:57,428 --> 00:39:58,600
See Mr.Dhananjayan,

740
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:00,440
I am very sorry.

741
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:01,933
Within ten days,

742
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,002
you have to settle it.
- I'll do it, Sir.

743
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:06,609
Okay then.
- I will settle it.

744
00:40:07,738 --> 00:40:09,479
Where are you going?
Sit down.

745
00:40:09,974 --> 00:40:10,952
I will commit suicide!

746
00:40:12,476 --> 00:40:14,752
Have you guys set out
to cheat the bank?

747
00:40:15,212 --> 00:40:17,419
What farming do you do?
- Script!

748
00:40:17,715 --> 00:40:19,661
Script farming?
What's that?

749
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:22,825
Well.. Farming"

750
00:40:23,854 --> 00:40:25,094
There isn't any farming, Sir.

751
00:40:25,623 --> 00:40:26,601
No farming?

752
00:40:27,958 --> 00:40:30,939
You mortgaged gold and took
a farmers' loan from here.

753
00:40:31,195 --> 00:40:32,195
Well..

754
00:40:32,196 --> 00:40:35,939
I thought the interest would be
lesser if it was a farmers' loan.

755
00:40:36,467 --> 00:40:37,605
That's why..

756
00:40:38,035 --> 00:40:39,776
It's been 8 months
since your term expired.

757
00:40:40,204 --> 00:40:42,205
I sent 5 notices as well.
- I've brought all of them, Sir.

758
00:40:42,206 --> 00:40:43,446
Why?
- No need?

759
00:40:43,507 --> 00:40:44,679
Am I going to eat it or what?

760
00:40:48,646 --> 00:40:49,624
Sir!

761
00:40:49,713 --> 00:40:51,556
After paying the loan
amount and interest,

762
00:40:51,916 --> 00:40:53,918
can't you re-sell this gold?

763
00:40:54,185 --> 00:40:55,493
I didn't get you.

764
00:40:55,586 --> 00:40:56,564
Well, sir..

765
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:59,700
Imagine that you paid me the
loan amount and interest.

766
00:41:00,157 --> 00:41:03,726
Imagine that I gave that entire amount
back to you without taking a single penny.

767
00:41:03,727 --> 00:41:05,061
You don't have to touch the gold.

768
00:41:05,062 --> 00:41:07,565
You will get the money & I'm safe as well!
How is it, Sir?

769
00:41:08,265 --> 00:41:09,899
Great idea!
- Thank you sir.

770
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:12,005
Sir, you do one thing.
You sit here. I'll sit there.

771
00:41:12,069 --> 00:41:13,069
No, Sir.

772
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:15,016
Sit here, Sir.
- No. - Sit here!

773
00:41:15,072 --> 00:41:17,450
No, man!
Sorry. No, Sir.

774
00:41:18,943 --> 00:41:21,753
There's no compulsion that every
gold item should be taken as mortgage.

775
00:41:22,213 --> 00:41:24,159
You need the manager's
permission for that.

776
00:41:24,281 --> 00:41:25,726
That means, my permission.

777
00:41:26,283 --> 00:41:28,024
I'm not going to give
permission to you!

778
00:41:28,552 --> 00:41:29,530
Period!

779
00:41:30,754 --> 00:41:31,732
Sir,

780
00:41:31,922 --> 00:41:33,094
don't say that, Sir.

781
00:41:33,858 --> 00:41:35,838
I'm in a lot of trouble, Sir.

782
00:41:36,527 --> 00:41:37,904
Please help me.

783
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:39,140
Please sir.

784
00:41:40,631 --> 00:41:41,769
Because it's you,

785
00:41:42,099 --> 00:41:43,578
just because it's you,

786
00:41:43,634 --> 00:41:44,704
<i>I will help you.</i>

787
00:41:45,302 --> 00:41:46,280
Within 4 days,

788
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:48,047
that means, on the coming 15th;

789
00:41:48,772 --> 00:41:50,877
you should bring money from
somewhere or the other.

790
00:41:52,309 --> 00:41:53,879
It's a matter of just one hour.

791
00:41:54,545 --> 00:41:57,313
You can get the gold and immediately
mortgage it in a different scheme.

792
00:41:57,314 --> 00:41:58,759
You'll get the
money immediately.

793
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:00,194
But Sir..

794
00:42:01,051 --> 00:42:03,122
There won't be any changes
in what I said right now.

795
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:06,695
And if you don't bring
the money on time,

796
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:08,727
I will auction the gold.

797
00:42:08,959 --> 00:42:10,495
There's no point
crying after that.

798
00:42:11,662 --> 00:42:12,640
Understood?

799
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:14,069
Sir..
- Now get going!

800
00:42:16,667 --> 00:42:17,645
Okay Sir.

801
00:42:24,775 --> 00:42:26,976
The movie's name is 'Millionaire',

802
00:42:26,977 --> 00:42:29,753
but the producer hasn't
given us a single penny.

803
00:42:31,615 --> 00:42:33,322
I don't know where
to arrange it from.

804
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:40,766
Dude, why don't you ask Shibu?

805
00:42:41,158 --> 00:42:42,535
Isn't he your best friend?

806
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:43,660
Sound!

807
00:42:43,661 --> 00:42:44,639
Camera.

808
00:42:45,996 --> 00:42:46,974
Action!

809
00:42:49,166 --> 00:42:50,144
Cut it!

810
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,200
Go!

811
00:42:51,201 --> 00:42:53,613
No, dude.
- Sud hi, shall we try a different range?

812
00:42:53,671 --> 00:42:55,048
His first film is going on, right?

813
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:57,318
Let it happen.

814
00:42:57,741 --> 00:42:58,719
Shall I leave?

815
00:43:04,048 --> 00:43:05,026
Come in.

816
00:43:05,115 --> 00:43:06,116
Keep this bag inside.

817
00:43:08,185 --> 00:43:09,664
Surprise!

818
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:13,794
Sneha!

819
00:43:13,857 --> 00:43:14,961
Oh! You're also here?

820
00:43:15,025 --> 00:43:16,197
Yes!
- When did you all reach?

821
00:43:16,293 --> 00:43:18,061
We reached in the afternoon.
- Okay.

822
00:43:18,062 --> 00:43:20,196
When they said they're coming in the
afternoon, I took a half-day leave.

823
00:43:20,197 --> 00:43:21,397
That's good.
- Let's cut it!

824
00:43:21,398 --> 00:43:22,832
Oh! Grand programme, huh?

825
00:43:22,833 --> 00:43:24,400
You'll have a ball, right?
Okay. Carry on.

826
00:43:24,401 --> 00:43:26,002
I'll just go freshen up.

827
00:43:26,003 --> 00:43:27,914
- Hey, see if that chicken
is cooked properly.

828
00:43:27,972 --> 00:43:30,740
- What are you doing?
- Who will roll these Chappatis then?

829
00:43:30,741 --> 00:43:33,347
- Go there and check.
- Lazy bum!

830
00:43:33,711 --> 00:43:35,748
Even though I've assisted
in so many movies,

831
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:38,187
there's no point!

832
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:41,190
Only if I make at least
a short film myself;

833
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:43,292
the producer would have
a confidence in me.

834
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:46,767
Let it happen.

835
00:43:49,927 --> 00:43:51,201
This chain"

836
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:52,967
is a memory of my mom.

837
00:43:58,068 --> 00:44:00,207
When it is with me, it's
like my mom is with me.

838
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:04,718
I don't need this. I'll
try some other option.

839
00:44:05,342 --> 00:44:07,788
Sheesh! I didn't say
that to upset you.

840
00:44:07,845 --> 00:44:09,620
It won't be in the
bank forever, right?

841
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,751
It will definitely come back to us.
You get going!

842
00:44:12,449 --> 00:44:13,757
Go!
- Alby!

843
00:44:14,918 --> 00:44:16,420
Didn't you take bath yet?

844
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:19,635
My Chicken Mughlai is almost done.
If you're late, you won't get even one piece.

845
00:44:19,723 --> 00:44:21,758
Then don't blame me.
- How did you arrange all this?

846
00:44:21,759 --> 00:44:23,393
I arranged it.
Don't worry.

847
00:44:23,394 --> 00:44:24,761
Go <i>&</i> take bath!
Go!

848
00:44:24,762 --> 00:44:25,900
- Sarah!
- I'm coming!

849
00:44:26,096 --> 00:44:28,076
- What is this?
A Church festival?

850
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:31,775
Alby has a friend - art
director Shaji Naduvil.

851
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:33,169
He is really famous!

852
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:35,271
All these are his art-works.

853
00:44:35,272 --> 00:44:37,912
After every movie, he drops
many such things here.

854
00:44:38,008 --> 00:44:40,079
You saw all that?
It's all his!

855
00:44:40,711 --> 00:44:42,054
Curtains, carpets,

856
00:44:42,479 --> 00:44:43,958
and many such things.

857
00:44:44,248 --> 00:44:46,888
And for some movies, he takes
some of them back as well.

858
00:44:47,418 --> 00:44:50,126
But he would give us something
else instead. That's the routine.

859
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:54,234
We don't have the kind of money
you guys spend on furniture!

860
00:44:54,291 --> 00:44:55,395
We are poor people!

861
00:44:57,161 --> 00:44:58,162
- Have a little.

862
00:45:01,131 --> 00:45:02,365
How come you're late today?

863
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:03,743
Such a huge traffic block!

864
00:45:03,801 --> 00:45:05,337
Some lame political party's procession.

865
00:45:05,402 --> 00:45:06,745
Here you go.
- Thank you.

866
00:45:06,904 --> 00:45:07,882
It's organic!

867
00:45:08,005 --> 00:45:08,983
Thanks!

868
00:45:09,406 --> 00:45:11,974
Oh! It's housefull today, huh?
- These are my college friends.

869
00:45:11,975 --> 00:45:13,242
This is Nayana. Our neighbour.

870
00:45:13,243 --> 00:45:14,221
Hi <i>Nayana!</i>

871
00:45:14,278 --> 00:45:16,189
Nayana is a fabulous cook.

872
00:45:16,313 --> 00:45:17,291
<i>Rwy?
' Ya'.!</i>

873
00:45:17,514 --> 00:45:19,187
Come, have dinner.
- No, dear.

874
00:45:19,249 --> 00:45:21,786
Though I'm not as good as
you, I'm not so bad either.

875
00:45:22,519 --> 00:45:24,192
Okay then.
You guys have fun!

876
00:45:24,321 --> 00:45:25,857
Bye!
' Bye Nayana!

877
00:45:27,958 --> 00:45:29,403
There's another surprise as well!

878
00:45:29,526 --> 00:45:31,972
They came with a gift.
A washing machine.

879
00:45:32,162 --> 00:45:34,163
We thought we will gift
it during yourwedding,

880
00:45:34,164 --> 00:45:36,337
but there wasn't any
function, right?

881
00:45:43,006 --> 00:45:43,984
Awesome!

882
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:45,219
Thanks.

883
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:46,509
Check properly.

884
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:49,320
If there's anything wrong, we can
send it back with them only.

885
00:45:57,387 --> 00:45:59,196
Will his movie happen
any time soon?

886
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:03,068
It has been getting postponed
for a while, right?

887
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:07,731
Why can't Alby try doing some other
job or business along with this?

888
00:46:08,332 --> 00:46:09,902
These people live in a dream world.

889
00:46:10,234 --> 00:46:13,306
They are very reluctant
to accept the reality.

890
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:17,183
Did you see the recent
movie called 'Swapnam'?

891
00:46:17,241 --> 00:46:18,845
Of course! It's a nice movie!

892
00:46:18,909 --> 00:46:21,389
It's great. The director of
that movie is Alby's friend.

893
00:46:22,012 --> 00:46:23,913
The story <i>&</i> screenplay
came out in his name;

894
00:46:23,914 --> 00:46:25,154
but Alby was the
one who wrote it.

895
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:29,222
There are many who haven't achieved
anything in cinema, despite being talented.

896
00:46:29,353 --> 00:46:30,853
Alby is in that stage now.

897
00:46:30,854 --> 00:46:32,094
But not for long!

898
00:46:32,189 --> 00:46:33,395
I'm sure about that.

899
00:46:40,497 --> 00:46:42,943
Dude, I can give it back
to you within 2-3 months.

900
00:46:44,101 --> 00:46:45,808
Can you adjust
somehow?

901
00:46:48,338 --> 00:46:50,511
How long would you
be there tonight?

902
00:46:51,975 --> 00:46:53,318
Okay! I'll come right now.

903
00:46:53,377 --> 00:46:55,789
Hey bro! I had booked a new car.

904
00:46:55,913 --> 00:46:57,119
So I am a little tight now.

905
00:46:57,247 --> 00:46:58,815
- Don't be distressed. Cheer up.
- I'll see you later then.

906
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:00,386
The meeting has started.
- You go ahead. I'll come.

907
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:02,896
It's okay, man. Carry on with yourwork.
- Bye.

908
00:47:06,356 --> 00:47:08,461
Dude I had messaged
you about the money.

909
00:47:08,525 --> 00:47:10,334
- I saw it.
- Can you do something?

910
00:47:10,394 --> 00:47:12,601
- Dude, if it was 2 days
earlier, I could do something.

911
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:13,930
- But now..
- Is it?

912
00:47:13,931 --> 00:47:15,308
- Such a huge amount.

913
00:47:15,365 --> 00:47:16,935
- Would be difficult.
- Okay.

914
00:47:28,378 --> 00:47:29,857
Alby!

915
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:31,550
Come here.
Come on!

916
00:47:32,416 --> 00:47:34,953
For this anniversary of our flat,

917
00:47:35,252 --> 00:47:37,425
I'll be doing a special item.

918
00:47:38,288 --> 00:47:40,427
You should watch it <i>&</i>
give me your suggestions.

919
00:47:41,391 --> 00:47:44,099
Since it's a
cinema-style adaptation,

920
00:47:44,361 --> 00:47:47,501
only new-gen people like you
can fully understand it.

921
00:47:48,131 --> 00:47:49,109
You should watch it.

922
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:50,933
Shall we go right now?

923
00:47:50,934 --> 00:47:52,208
Uncle, I have some work.

924
00:47:52,436 --> 00:47:53,938
Hey!

925
00:47:54,137 --> 00:47:55,445
That's not right.

926
00:47:55,973 --> 00:47:57,039
You should watch it.

927
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,348
Please.

928
00:47:58,642 --> 00:47:59,620
One second.

929
00:48:00,344 --> 00:48:01,982
Hello Shaji.
- Hey Alby!

930
00:48:02,179 --> 00:48:03,446
What is it?
- It's ready!

931
00:48:03,447 --> 00:48:05,448
Talk loudly. I can't hear you.
- The money is ready.

932
00:48:05,449 --> 00:48:07,087
You'll get it at 10 AM tomorrow.

933
00:48:07,351 --> 00:48:08,557
Phew!
- I'll bring it!

934
00:48:08,619 --> 00:48:10,486
Thank you so much, bro!

935
00:48:10,487 --> 00:48:11,625
What?
Thank you?

936
00:48:11,955 --> 00:48:13,127
Get lost, dude!

937
00:48:13,457 --> 00:48:15,403
Give me a treat later.
- Okay.

938
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:18,501
Shall we go?
- Uncle, we'll rock the programme!

939
00:48:19,129 --> 00:48:21,370
No need of any tension!
- Shall we go now then?

940
00:48:21,531 --> 00:48:22,509
<i>Tomorrow.</i>

941
00:48:22,633 --> 00:48:24,010
I'll watch it tomorrow.
- When?

942
00:48:24,101 --> 00:48:25,079
3 PM.

943
00:48:25,135 --> 00:48:26,113
Okay?

944
00:48:26,169 --> 00:48:28,206
We'll go in my car.
- I have my bike.

945
00:48:35,679 --> 00:48:40,016
After the work here, you should arrange
the hall on top <i>&</i> the hall downstairs too.

946
00:48:40,017 --> 00:48:42,520
You should take care of everything.
Nothing should go wrong.

947
00:48:42,619 --> 00:48:44,353
Rosamma, I'm coming!

948
00:48:44,354 --> 00:48:45,332
Phew!

949
00:48:52,195 --> 00:48:54,675
What's this new habit? I haven't
seen you doing this before.

950
00:48:55,232 --> 00:48:56,336
Health is wealth!

951
00:48:56,967 --> 00:48:57,945
Watching movies,

952
00:48:58,201 --> 00:49:00,436
writing; and health.
- Are you talking in Tamil?

953
00:49:00,437 --> 00:49:02,974
I have to update everything.
Not Tamil; Malayalam.

954
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:05,541
You don't tell me when
you update all these!

955
00:49:05,542 --> 00:49:07,647
Are you leaving?
One second. I'll drop you.

956
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:09,655
Nayana, I'm leaving.
- Okay.

957
00:49:12,349 --> 00:49:13,327
Close the door.

958
00:49:13,417 --> 00:49:15,090
Come fast!
- Ya.

959
00:49:17,254 --> 00:49:18,232
Good morning.

960
00:49:18,689 --> 00:49:19,667
Good morning.

961
00:49:20,390 --> 00:49:21,368
I'll drop you.

962
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:25,394
Don't lose your glamour because
of the dust <i>&</i> the heat.

963
00:49:25,395 --> 00:49:26,373
Carry on.

964
00:49:27,464 --> 00:49:28,704
Why don't you buy a cal'?

965
00:49:29,766 --> 00:49:30,744
Please.

966
00:49:32,135 --> 00:49:33,273
Get lost, you dog!

967
00:49:42,412 --> 00:49:44,414
Okay! Thank you so much!
- You're always welcome.

968
00:49:44,548 --> 00:49:46,687
Okay bye.
- Sir, buy a lottery ticket please.

969
00:49:47,050 --> 00:49:48,028
Sir!

970
00:49:48,185 --> 00:49:49,163
Just one.

971
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:51,489
Sir..
- Didn't I say no?

972
00:49:51,555 --> 00:49:53,626
It's today's ticket, Sir.
- Hello!

973
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:55,595
- Hello! It's Brittas, Sir.

974
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:58,640
We have received the deal
from the best company in US.

975
00:49:59,262 --> 00:50:00,673
If we lose it,

976
00:50:01,131 --> 00:50:03,202
my dear Brittas, I'll be frank;

977
00:50:03,367 --> 00:50:05,779
I will give you a deadline!
I'm telling you..

978
00:50:17,781 --> 00:50:19,124
Good morning.
- Morning.

979
00:50:19,182 --> 00:50:20,716
Devayani will be
late today as well.

980
00:50:20,717 --> 00:50:22,754
Will you be here today?
- I might go out in between.

981
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:24,192
I'll be back soon.

982
00:50:24,588 --> 00:50:25,566
One minute.

983
00:50:26,156 --> 00:50:27,156
Hello.

984
00:50:27,157 --> 00:50:28,524
Madam, it's me Gokul.

985
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:30,095
I couldn't get through
to Sudhi Sir.

986
00:50:30,394 --> 00:50:31,600
That's why I called you.

987
00:50:31,828 --> 00:50:34,434
I had to give him some cash.
- Sudhi had told me.

988
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:36,408
Where have you reached?
- I'm downstairs, madam.

989
00:50:36,466 --> 00:50:38,707
Below the flat.
- Okay. Come fast. I'm here.

990
00:50:40,037 --> 00:50:41,345
Someone is coming.

991
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:44,473
Didn't you tell me a story of a movie
that day? What happened to that?

992
00:50:44,474 --> 00:50:47,045
I had told that to a producer.

993
00:50:47,444 --> 00:50:49,253
But nothing has progressed"

994
00:50:49,579 --> 00:50:51,320
I really liked that story.

995
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:54,127
If I had the money, I
would have produced it.

996
00:50:55,318 --> 00:50:57,423
Sarah isn't really interested
in all this, right?

997
00:50:58,055 --> 00:51:01,195
She is interested only in
sending me to buy grocery.

998
00:51:03,593 --> 00:51:04,799
Good morning, madam.
- Morning!

999
00:51:05,062 --> 00:51:06,132
Alby, key.
- Here you go.

1000
00:51:07,130 --> 00:51:08,234
We'll sit inside.

1001
00:51:08,298 --> 00:51:10,244
No, madam. I'm in a hurry.

1002
00:51:13,170 --> 00:51:14,808
There's one Iakh in this.
Please check.

1003
00:51:20,610 --> 00:51:22,681
So Madam's key is with you, huh?

1004
00:51:22,813 --> 00:51:24,213
What's your name?
- Gokul.

1005
00:51:24,214 --> 00:51:26,148
Where do you live?
- Kakkanad. Why, sir?

1006
00:51:26,149 --> 00:51:27,883
Who all are there at home?
- Just me <i>&</i> my wife.

1007
00:51:27,884 --> 00:51:29,295
How is your wife?

1008
00:51:29,453 --> 00:51:31,194
Oh Sir!

1009
00:51:31,555 --> 00:51:32,533
Get going!

1010
00:51:32,789 --> 00:51:34,826
Bye then!
- You're not so right!

1011
00:51:38,862 --> 00:51:39,840
Alby!
- Hi Edwin.

1012
00:51:39,896 --> 00:51:41,204
Alby!
Key!

1013
00:51:41,798 --> 00:51:43,368
Did you meet the producer?
- Bye.

1014
00:51:45,168 --> 00:51:46,272
So you signed it?

1015
00:51:48,171 --> 00:51:49,707
So there's no more trouble.
Congrats!

1016
00:51:50,907 --> 00:51:51,885
I need a treat!

1017
00:52:01,218 --> 00:52:02,196
Hello Shaji.

1018
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:04,290
Dude, the money..

1019
00:52:04,454 --> 00:52:05,454
Where should I come?

1020
00:52:05,455 --> 00:52:07,264
My brother-in-law had
a bike accident.

1021
00:52:07,657 --> 00:52:09,534
It's complicated.
It's a head injury.

1022
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:12,437
So the cash I was
supposed to give you..

1023
00:52:12,496 --> 00:52:14,563
Who is Mohan's by-stander?
- I had to use it here.

1024
00:52:14,564 --> 00:52:17,135
You adjust somehow.
- Dude, I have to pay it at 12 PM.

1025
00:52:17,434 --> 00:52:18,901
If you say this at
the last minute"

1026
00:52:18,902 --> 00:52:20,603
- I'll call you. Doctor is here.
- Shaji!

1027
00:52:20,604 --> 00:52:21,776
- I'll call you.

1028
00:53:06,249 --> 00:53:07,387
There's one Iakh in this.

1029
00:53:18,428 --> 00:53:20,271
'If you don't bring the money on time,

1030
00:53:20,931 --> 00:53:22,376
I'll auction the gold.'

1031
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:32,185
'This chain"

1032
00:53:32,475 --> 00:53:33,809
is a memory of my mom'

1033
00:53:33,810 --> 00:53:35,915
'When this is with me, it
feels like mom is with me'

1034

<i>www.desireleasers.com</i>

1035
00:55:22,452 --> 00:55:23,897
It's just a matter of one hour.

1036
00:55:24,521 --> 00:55:27,423
You can get the gold <i>&</i> mortgage
it in another scheme immediately.

1037
00:55:27,424 --> 00:55:28,732
You'll get the money immediately.

1038
00:55:39,436 --> 00:55:42,508
- Move your vehicle!

1039
00:55:43,606 --> 00:55:44,584
Brother!

1040
00:55:46,776 --> 00:55:48,449
Brother, please move.
Let me talk to him.

1041
00:55:48,511 --> 00:55:50,616
Bro, please move your vehicle.

1042
00:55:51,481 --> 00:55:53,722
Don't get angry, brother.
Let me try..

1043
00:55:53,783 --> 00:55:54,955
Let me talk.
Please.

1044
00:55:55,352 --> 00:55:58,458
Brother, all of us can leave.
Please move your vehicle.

1045
00:55:58,855 --> 00:56:00,334
Don't create an issue.
Please.

1046
00:56:00,890 --> 00:56:02,836
Start your vehicles.
Please.

1047
00:56:13,470 --> 00:56:15,848
Are you crazy?
Is this how you ride?

1048
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:17,416
Do you want to die?

1049
00:56:20,176 --> 00:56:21,450
Stop!

1050
00:56:21,678 --> 00:56:23,157
Stop over there.

1051
00:56:23,646 --> 00:56:24,818
I have all the papers, Sir.

1052
00:56:24,914 --> 00:56:27,827
License, insurance, tax, pollution
certificate, all of them.

1053
00:56:28,651 --> 00:56:30,460
But you don't have a helmet!

1054
00:56:31,054 --> 00:56:32,124
Sir, I'm sorry.

1055
00:56:32,489 --> 00:56:34,957
I'm rushing to the bank urgently.
If I don't reach there on time,

1056
00:56:34,958 --> 00:56:36,028
it will be a big problem.

1057
00:56:36,159 --> 00:56:37,832
It will be a bigger problem here.

1058
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:39,597
Go stand in the queue.

1059
00:56:39,996 --> 00:56:41,805
Sir, please.
- Go stand in the queue.

1060
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:37,719
Sir!
- Have you brought the cash?

1061
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:39,495
I have brought it.
- Go to the gold section.

1062
00:57:39,556 --> 00:57:40,534
Okay sir.

1063
00:57:43,793 --> 00:57:45,568
I have come to
renew a gold loan.

1064
00:57:46,229 --> 00:57:48,869
Have you brought the full amount?
- I've brought the full amount.

1065
00:57:48,932 --> 00:57:50,036
Give me the receipt.

1066
00:57:57,574 --> 00:57:58,552
Gosh!

1067
00:57:58,908 --> 00:58:00,251
Where's the loan receipt?

1068
00:58:01,177 --> 00:58:03,779
Sir, I kept it in my bike
<i>&</i> forgot to take it.

1069
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:05,614
The bike ran out of
fuel <i>&</i> is on the road.

1070
00:58:05,615 --> 00:58:07,720
Forgot it on your bike?

1071
00:58:08,218 --> 00:58:09,720
This is not possible
without that.

1072
00:58:09,786 --> 00:58:11,286
Sir, I've brought the full amount.

1073
00:58:11,287 --> 00:58:13,789
What's the point?
You should have the receipt.

1074
00:58:13,790 --> 00:58:14,890
Isn't that the rule?

1075
00:58:14,891 --> 00:58:16,734
Don't we need proof
that it's your gold?

1076
00:58:18,728 --> 00:58:20,929
Sir, ten minutes.
I'll be right back.

1077
00:58:20,930 --> 00:58:21,908
Okay! Go!

1078
00:58:31,908 --> 00:58:33,546
Why is he leaving?
Didn't he settle it?

1079
00:58:33,610 --> 00:58:36,557
Sir, he brought the money; but
forgot to bring the receipt.

1080
00:58:37,113 --> 00:58:38,751
You should keep
threatening these guys,

1081
00:58:38,815 --> 00:58:41,261
by saying that we'll auction it,
confiscate it or collect fines.

1082
00:58:41,551 --> 00:58:42,825
You saw how the money came now?

1083
00:58:43,753 --> 00:58:45,733
Get hold of the other
defaulters as well. - Okay.

1084
00:59:12,949 --> 00:59:13,927
Brother!

1085
00:59:14,717 --> 00:59:16,253
Brother, please come.

1086
00:59:16,953 --> 00:59:17,931
Brother,

1087
00:59:18,221 --> 00:59:20,355
can you ask the Sir from
gold section to come here?

1088
00:59:20,356 --> 00:59:21,767
Lunch break isn't over it.

1089
00:59:21,824 --> 00:59:23,659
I'm in a hurry. Please ask him to come.
- He will come now.

1090
00:59:23,660 --> 00:59:25,298
Have this Iaddoo.
He will come now.

1091
00:59:25,795 --> 00:59:26,865
He will come now.

1092
00:59:36,172 --> 00:59:37,150
Okay.
All the best.

1093
00:59:37,674 --> 00:59:38,652
Okay.

1094
00:59:39,976 --> 00:59:41,785
Aren't you going home directly now?

1095
00:59:44,647 --> 00:59:45,625
Sir!

1096
00:59:45,982 --> 00:59:46,960
Did you get the Iaddoo?

1097
00:59:49,052 --> 00:59:50,156
Here you go, Sir.

1098
00:59:51,220 --> 00:59:53,325
How could you forget this
on your bike, man?

1099
00:59:53,790 --> 00:59:54,894
Make it fast, Sir.

1100
00:59:54,958 --> 00:59:56,062
Let me drink this, man!

1101
00:59:59,195 --> 01:00:01,175
Give this over there <i>&</i> pay the money.
- Okay sir.

1102
01:00:08,671 --> 01:00:09,649
Thank you sir.

1103
01:00:12,709 --> 01:00:13,687
Johnson!

1104
01:00:13,977 --> 01:00:14,955
Get this.

1105
01:00:18,381 --> 01:00:19,359
Sir.

1106
01:00:20,917 --> 01:00:21,952
Sir, this is the one.

1107
01:00:22,318 --> 01:00:23,296
Let me check.

1108
01:00:25,221 --> 01:00:26,359
This is the one, right?
- Yes.

1109
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:28,034
Sure?
- Yes.

1110
01:00:37,367 --> 01:00:38,607
Collect the cash.

1111
01:00:53,816 --> 01:00:54,816
Brother,

1112
01:00:54,817 --> 01:00:55,795
one tea.

1113
01:01:01,758 --> 01:01:02,736
Sir,

1114
01:01:03,893 --> 01:01:05,065
Do you remember me?

1115
01:01:06,329 --> 01:01:08,331
The same beard;
the same face;

1116
01:01:08,464 --> 01:01:10,637
I have kept it exactly
like you said, Sir.

1117
01:01:11,234 --> 01:01:12,907
When will you start
your movie, Sir?

1118
01:01:14,904 --> 01:01:16,679
Sir!
- Brother, one vada.

1119
01:01:18,007 --> 01:01:19,350
No need, Sir.
- Have it.

1120
01:01:19,442 --> 01:01:21,046
You have it, Sir.

1121
01:01:21,110 --> 01:01:23,078
We have to do a movie together, right?
Have it.

1122
01:01:23,079 --> 01:01:24,114
Okay then.

1123
01:01:24,814 --> 01:01:25,792
Here.

1124
01:01:26,482 --> 01:01:27,460
Shall I leave?

1125
01:01:28,751 --> 01:01:30,788
Sir, do well!

1126
01:01:30,953 --> 01:01:32,432
Your movie will be a super-hit!

1127
01:02:21,804 --> 01:02:22,874
What are you doing here?

1128
01:02:25,374 --> 01:02:26,352
Sudhi!

1129
01:03:13,055 --> 01:03:18,055
<i>www.desireleasers.com</i>

1130
01:03:54,831 --> 01:03:56,469
Have I ever hidden
anything from you?

1131
01:03:58,968 --> 01:04:00,072
I heard what happened.

1132
01:04:04,941 --> 01:04:06,215
That bank manager had called me.

1133
01:04:06,609 --> 01:04:09,419
When he said a lot of stuff to me,
I gave it back to him strongly!

1134
01:04:09,946 --> 01:04:11,220
I have asked for a month's time.

1135
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:13,624
And then I hung up telling
him to do whatever he wants!

1136
01:04:15,918 --> 01:04:17,898
I'm just disappointed
that you didn't tell me.

1137
01:04:17,987 --> 01:04:18,965
Idiot!

1138
01:04:19,288 --> 01:04:21,063
Actually, I have
arranged the cash.

1139
01:04:21,290 --> 01:04:23,395
Swapna from my office has
promised to give me the fund.

1140
01:04:23,459 --> 01:04:25,439
Even if she doesn't give it,
we should let it go!

1141
01:04:26,028 --> 01:04:28,167
If my mom's chain is not with me,
will my mom leave me?

1142
01:04:30,366 --> 01:04:31,401
Don't be tensed.

1143
01:04:32,435 --> 01:04:34,608
Everything is solved, right?
Then why are you tensed?

1144
01:04:49,652 --> 01:04:51,632
Kumaran!
Kumaran!

1145
01:04:51,687 --> 01:04:55,396
There's no change in the timing
of my programme, right Kumaran?

1146
01:04:56,225 --> 01:04:58,967
Haven't I told you not to call me
Kumaran in front of the public?

1147
01:04:59,028 --> 01:05:00,939
Then what should I call you?
- Call me Mr.Kumar.

1148
01:05:00,997 --> 01:05:02,533
Kumaretta!
- Oh God!

1149
01:05:02,632 --> 01:05:04,165
Daddy!
- Sandra!

1150
01:05:04,166 --> 01:05:06,305
Is it time for me to
get on the spear yet?

1151
01:05:07,003 --> 01:05:08,641
I'll send you on the
spear, my darling!

1152
01:05:09,005 --> 01:05:11,451
If it is past 9, he will
sleep on the spear.

1153
01:05:11,941 --> 01:05:13,011
Then don't blame me!

1154
01:05:13,242 --> 01:05:14,243
Do one thing.

1155
01:05:14,310 --> 01:05:17,348
After the 'Thiruvathira', Dakini
& Luttappi can get on the spear.

1156
01:05:17,413 --> 01:05:18,517
Okay!

1157
01:05:18,581 --> 01:05:21,016
Mr.Dushyanthan, there are
some changes in the schedule.

1158
01:05:21,017 --> 01:05:22,517
It will start only
by around 9.30-10.

1159
01:05:22,518 --> 01:05:23,929
What is this, man?
- What?

1160
01:05:23,986 --> 01:05:26,262
I've been in this costume
for 2 hours now.

1161
01:05:26,355 --> 01:05:29,157
The president has complete
authority to change the schedule.

1162
01:05:29,158 --> 01:05:31,138
And I don't like anyone
questioning the president.

1163
01:05:31,193 --> 01:05:33,361
The president has complete
authority to change the schedule.

1164
01:05:33,362 --> 01:05:34,696
And even I don't like anyone
questioning the president.

1165
01:05:34,697 --> 01:05:37,075
Well, didn't I say the
same thing to him?

1166
01:05:37,133 --> 01:05:39,340
I just underlined it.
- Don't underline too much.

1167
01:05:39,468 --> 01:05:42,608
This president has the authority to
erase that <i>&</i> throw you away as well.

1168
01:05:42,939 --> 01:05:44,646
The guest is about to arrive.
Move.

1169
01:05:45,975 --> 01:05:47,010
I'll have this later.

1170
01:05:47,276 --> 01:05:49,044
Let the rest be there.
- Dwarf Kumaran!

1171
01:05:49,045 --> 01:05:51,389
I should have kicked him!

1172
01:05:51,681 --> 01:05:53,592
I've been waiting for so long.

1173
01:05:54,617 --> 01:05:56,995
Are you going to act
wearing glasses?

1174
01:05:58,187 --> 01:06:01,100
I haven't removed them even
when I acted as Judas.

1175
01:06:01,290 --> 01:06:03,600
And you want me to take them
off for this Dushyanthan?

1176
01:06:03,659 --> 01:06:06,196
Fix a drink!
- Good that you didn't act as Jesus.

1177
01:06:06,362 --> 01:06:09,366
We would have had to see him
on the cross with glasses.

1178
01:06:11,033 --> 01:06:12,239
Aren't you ready yet?

1179
01:06:12,535 --> 01:06:13,536
You carry on.
- What?

1180
01:06:13,769 --> 01:06:14,975
You go <i>&</i> come back.

1181
01:06:15,237 --> 01:06:16,545
Oh! Then I'm also not going.

1182
01:06:17,239 --> 01:06:19,048
Sarah, you go ahead.
I'm not in a mood.

1183
01:06:19,308 --> 01:06:21,652
What mood? You don't
come with me anywhere.

1184
01:06:21,777 --> 01:06:23,222
I have some work.
- What work?

1185
01:06:23,279 --> 01:06:26,089
If we go down for some time,
hell won't break loose.

1186
01:06:26,449 --> 01:06:28,759
What will happen to you if
you come to a gathering?

1187
01:06:29,585 --> 01:06:30,785
Don't spoil my mood!

1188
01:06:30,786 --> 01:06:32,595
<i>Sarah,
you go ahead.</i>

1189
01:06:32,655 --> 01:06:34,760
I'm not feeling well.
- No. Come with me.

1190
01:06:35,224 --> 01:06:36,328
Don't spoil my mood.
Come!

1191
01:06:36,459 --> 01:06:39,440
Please, Alby!
See! lam all dressed up!

1192
01:06:39,528 --> 01:06:40,506
Come!

1193
01:06:40,629 --> 01:06:43,132
Alby, please come!

1194
01:06:44,233 --> 01:06:45,735
Come!
- I'll come!

1195
01:06:47,737 --> 01:06:49,239
Can you lift me as well?

1196
01:06:51,540 --> 01:06:52,518
Good boy!

1197
01:07:05,788 --> 01:07:07,790
Hello!
Where were you?

1198
01:07:11,594 --> 01:07:13,699
Hey! Hey!
Stop it!

1199
01:07:14,296 --> 01:07:17,132
Don't go off-beat and
spoil my reputation here!

1200
01:07:17,133 --> 01:07:18,578
Boss, you are the
one going off-beat!

1201
01:07:18,634 --> 01:07:19,612
You idiot!

1202
01:07:19,835 --> 01:07:22,145
You rhythm-less donkeys!

1203
01:07:22,271 --> 01:07:24,251
I left that as an off-beat.

1204
01:07:24,306 --> 01:07:26,582
Boss is already off!
Don't make him go wrong!

1205
01:07:26,642 --> 01:07:27,712
You go ahead, boss!

1206
01:07:27,810 --> 01:07:29,721
Ready 1,2,3 Start!
- The chief guest is here. Come fast!

1207
01:07:29,812 --> 01:07:32,113
Bring the bouquet <i>&</i> garland!
Fasfl

1208
01:07:32,114 --> 01:07:33,787
The guest is here. Shyam,
bring the bouquet.

1209
01:07:34,683 --> 01:07:36,026
Babu, the fireworks!

1210
01:07:36,385 --> 01:07:37,363
Right away!

1211
01:07:37,453 --> 01:07:38,488
Forward! Forward!

1212
01:07:39,288 --> 01:07:41,290
Come on! Start playing the drums!

1213
01:07:47,296 --> 01:07:48,274
See!

1214
01:07:49,465 --> 01:07:50,443
Step out.

1215
01:07:53,302 --> 01:07:55,213
Hello!
- I am the president here.

1216
01:07:55,271 --> 01:07:56,249
Hi.

1217
01:07:57,306 --> 01:07:58,649
Hearty welcome.

1218
01:07:58,707 --> 01:08:00,516
Thank you!
- Come in!

1219
01:08:00,676 --> 01:08:02,678
- This is too long!
- Babu, light it!

1220
01:08:02,878 --> 01:08:03,856
Right away!

1221
01:08:04,180 --> 01:08:06,182
Damn! Where does this end?

1222
01:08:09,885 --> 01:08:10,863
Hello handsome men,

1223
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:12,292
and beautiful ladies;

1224
01:08:12,822 --> 01:08:16,133
God has given you eyes and ears.

1225
01:08:16,492 --> 01:08:18,563
He gave you a mouth; and wisdom too.
What for?

1226
01:08:19,228 --> 01:08:20,263
To do something!

1227
01:08:20,396 --> 01:08:22,376
To do something creative!

1228
01:08:22,731 --> 01:08:27,373
Instead, God didn't give us all
this to ogle at random girls!

1229
01:08:28,237 --> 01:08:29,537
Nothing is impossible!

1230
01:08:29,538 --> 01:08:32,815
Because what impossible itself means
- I am possible!

1231
01:08:33,442 --> 01:08:35,854
Sir, please say a punch dialogue
from your latest movie.

1232
01:08:36,245 --> 01:08:37,553
That too, in English.

1233
01:08:38,314 --> 01:08:40,123
You want English and
not Malayalam, huh?

1234
01:08:40,182 --> 01:08:41,525
It's better to hear
it in English.

1235
01:08:43,819 --> 01:08:45,389
Do you know the
meaning of justice?

1236
01:08:45,454 --> 01:08:47,092
Do you know the meaning
of intelligence?

1237
01:08:47,156 --> 01:08:48,533
Do you know the
meaning of wisdom?

1238
01:08:48,724 --> 01:08:51,466
The word intelligence means the
capability of a particular person,

1239
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:54,541
to evaluate, to validate, to judge a
particular thing in a particular way!

1240
01:08:54,897 --> 01:08:57,309
Don't play with me, I will
show you how to play!

1241
01:08:57,466 --> 01:08:59,468
There is nothing that's
impossible for Chiranjeevi.

1242
01:08:59,568 --> 01:09:01,377
Everything is possible.
- It'll be ready now!

1243
01:09:01,437 --> 01:09:03,144
Because impossible means
- I am possible.

1244
01:09:03,205 --> 01:09:05,708
Don't try to catch a bird flying
in the sky with a ladder.

1245
01:09:05,808 --> 01:09:07,685
You'll be screwed!
Keep in mind!

1246
01:09:08,144 --> 01:09:09,316
Gosh! It blasted!

1247
01:09:09,578 --> 01:09:11,387
What is this?

1248
01:09:13,782 --> 01:09:15,523
Dakini <i>&</i> Luttappi were awesome!

1249
01:09:15,618 --> 01:09:18,224
Everyone told me that.
- Where were you?

1250
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:19,697
I went to the washroom.

1251
01:09:19,788 --> 01:09:21,131
The programme is over.
Come!

1252
01:09:21,190 --> 01:09:22,423
You carry on.
I'll come!

1253
01:09:22,424 --> 01:09:24,165
Where are you going?
- I'll be back.

1254
01:09:24,426 --> 01:09:25,928
- Come. Let's go.
- Aren't you coming?

1255
01:09:30,166 --> 01:09:31,144
I checked.

1256
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:33,170
He didn't have any
other assignments.

1257
01:09:33,669 --> 01:09:35,649
I don't know where he has gone.

1258
01:09:35,871 --> 01:09:38,408
Wasn't he in the office yesterday?
- Yes.

1259
01:09:38,574 --> 01:09:39,882
He was there till noon.

1260
01:09:40,743 --> 01:09:42,552
And, it's Sudhi, right?

1261
01:09:43,245 --> 01:09:45,725
He changes his plans within seconds.

1262
01:09:45,981 --> 01:09:47,815
He must be planning to
give you a surprise.

1263
01:09:47,816 --> 01:09:48,851
Don't be tensed.

1264
01:09:49,218 --> 01:09:50,891
If I get to know anything,
I'll let you know.

1265
01:09:51,787 --> 01:09:54,393
Well, did you guys
have any fight?

1266
01:09:55,457 --> 01:09:56,697
Just like always.

1267
01:09:56,959 --> 01:09:57,937
Nothing more.

1268
01:09:58,961 --> 01:10:00,599
Okay then.
- Okay.

Yes. On the 10th floor.

I am in Kochi.

Okay Sir.
- Shall I listen to your story?

No, Sir. I'm out of station.

1278
01:11:07,863 --> 01:11:09,433
Can we meet after a few days?

1279
01:11:09,531 --> 01:11:10,874
- Is it?
- I'll call you, Sir.

1280
01:11:12,835 --> 01:11:13,813
Hey!

1281

Here VOu go!

Don't hit him.
He gave my mobile back to me.

1284
01:11:55,110 --> 01:11:56,987
So what? He stole it right?

1285
01:11:57,479 --> 01:11:59,049
- Sorry, brother!
- Leave him!

1286

Sudhi, I'm sorry.

What's going on here?
- I made a mistake, Sudhi.

1290
01:12:38,954 --> 01:12:40,092
Shut up!
What?

1291
01:12:40,456 --> 01:12:41,730
Sudhi, I made a mistake.
- Move!

1292
01:12:46,595 --> 01:12:48,939
Sudhi, I've returned whatever I took.
- Shut up!

1293
01:12:49,598 --> 01:12:50,872
You got in to steal?
- No!

Listen to me, Sudhi.

1298

Have you done this before?

No, Sudhi. Listen to me!
- No!

I don't want to hear anything.
Let me call the security!

Does Sarah cook?

Yes.

Do you have good neighbours?

You should surrender
to the police.

1335

The atonement for your sin, is
admitting that you have done it.

1336

And not hiding it.

And,

01:16:26,048 --> 01:16:28,289
you should explain everything
to Sarah yourself.

1390
01:20:09,371 --> 01:20:10,349
Come!

1391
01:20:25,921 --> 01:20:26,991
No dude.
I'm not coming.

1392
01:20:27,422 --> 01:20:29,902
Well, kids have come home.

1393
01:20:30,425 --> 01:20:33,167
And ya, if you get some
good pork; buy <i>&</i> send it home.

1394
01:20:54,249 --> 01:20:55,227
Hey!
- What?

1395
01:20:56,284 --> 01:20:57,262
Hey!

1396
01:21:08,630 --> 01:21:10,507
We were cutting grass here.

1397
01:21:10,565 --> 01:21:11,976
Who saw the body first?

1398
01:21:12,033 --> 01:21:13,376
I saw it first.
- Then?

1399
01:21:13,435 --> 01:21:17,281
I was cutting grass and suddenly
I saw something like a leg.

1400
01:21:17,472 --> 01:21:19,315
I got scared.
I called him immediately.

1401
01:21:19,574 --> 01:21:22,384
And immediately, we went and told
everything to the tea-shop owner.

1402
01:21:22,644 --> 01:21:24,123
And immediately called the cops.

1403
01:21:31,620 --> 01:21:33,930
Sir, the body has been identified.

1404
01:21:34,256 --> 01:21:35,428
Sudhi Ramachandran.

1405
01:21:45,934 --> 01:21:47,971
Since when has Sud hi
been missing?

1406
01:21:48,703 --> 01:21:49,909
From last Tuesday.

1407
01:21:55,410 --> 01:21:56,548
And..

1408
01:21:57,312 --> 01:21:59,223
Why were you so late in
lodging a complaint?

1409
01:22:00,515 --> 01:22:02,893
Usually he goes away for
2-3 days like this.

1410
01:22:03,418 --> 01:22:04,590
With friends and all.

1411
01:22:05,387 --> 01:22:07,060
And then he calls
me from somewhere,

1412
01:22:07,255 --> 01:22:08,495
to surprise me.

1413
01:22:09,357 --> 01:22:10,392
That's his routine.

1414
01:22:17,232 --> 01:22:18,506
Do you suspect anyone?

1415
01:22:19,034 --> 01:22:20,672
Colleagues, friends;

1416
01:22:21,536 --> 01:22:23,243
or someone in this flat?

1417
01:22:25,006 --> 01:22:26,349
Did Sudhi have any

1418
01:22:26,541 --> 01:22:28,145
extra-marital relationship?

1419
01:22:29,010 --> 01:22:29,988
I don't know.

1420
01:22:30,612 --> 01:22:36,585
<i>www.desireleasers.com</i>

1421
01:22:39,754 --> 01:22:40,732
Thank you.

1422
01:22:44,225 --> 01:22:45,225
Good tea.

1423
01:22:45,226 --> 01:22:46,204
Thanks.

1424
01:22:46,261 --> 01:22:48,639
The murder was definitely
not committed for money.

1425
01:22:49,431 --> 01:22:51,069
His purse <i>&</i> chain
were still with him.

1426
01:22:51,366 --> 01:22:52,367
We'll catch him!

1427
01:22:52,667 --> 01:22:54,510
We'll catch him!
Don't worry!

1428
01:22:55,403 --> 01:22:58,213
Inform me, if you want to
leave the city. Please.

1429
01:22:58,573 --> 01:23:01,179
And if you have any
doubt or lead;

1430
01:23:02,277 --> 01:23:04,553
you can call me even
during midnight.

1431
01:23:05,580 --> 01:23:06,558
Actually,

1432
01:23:06,614 --> 01:23:08,423
you don't have to call
during the night.

1433
01:23:08,583 --> 01:23:10,585
Why cause a family problem?

1434
01:23:14,289 --> 01:23:15,267
Don't cry..

1435
01:23:17,792 --> 01:23:19,237
I'm Nayana's elder sister.

1436
01:23:19,694 --> 01:23:21,002
The baby needs milk.

1437
01:23:21,096 --> 01:23:23,702
Where do you live?
- Our family is in Mum bai.

1438
01:23:24,165 --> 01:23:25,974
Aamchi Mumbai?
Really?

1439
01:23:26,234 --> 01:23:27,235
Where in Mumbai?

1440
01:23:27,369 --> 01:23:28,347
Goregaon.

1441
01:23:28,436 --> 01:23:30,074
Goregaon!

1442
01:23:30,372 --> 01:23:32,352
For 18 years, I was also there.

1443
01:23:32,474 --> 01:23:34,511
Dad was in the military.
That's why!

1444
01:23:36,544 --> 01:23:38,023
Okay. Leave it.

1445
01:23:38,313 --> 01:23:39,291
Heat the milk.

1446
01:23:39,447 --> 01:23:41,393
Thank you.
- Please, please.

1447
01:23:42,117 --> 01:23:44,495
Everyone says that you <i>&</i>
Sudhi have been fighting.

1448
01:23:44,586 --> 01:23:46,286
Nothing like that.
- Nothing like that?

1449
01:23:46,287 --> 01:23:47,766
Slight quarrels.

1450
01:23:48,023 --> 01:23:49,525
I am quite glamorous, right?

1451
01:23:49,591 --> 01:23:51,434
He always had that complex.

1452
01:23:51,626 --> 01:23:52,696
Are you whistling?

1453
01:23:53,628 --> 01:23:55,130
It's not me.
- With you?

1454
01:23:56,031 --> 01:23:57,009
You Only!

1455
01:23:57,165 --> 01:23:59,433
Because of the parking lot.
- They fight everyday.

1456
01:23:59,434 --> 01:24:00,412
I'll tell him.

1457
01:24:01,136 --> 01:24:02,513
There's nothing else, right?

1458
01:24:03,471 --> 01:24:05,417
That doesn't happen.
Right?

1459
01:24:06,541 --> 01:24:09,112
You haven't fought for anything else?
- No, Sir.

1460
01:24:13,048 --> 01:24:15,324
CI Manikandan!
- It's me!

1461
01:24:15,383 --> 01:24:17,693
I understood.
Why have you called, darling?

1462
01:24:17,786 --> 01:24:20,630
Well..
- Did that rat-trapper leave?

1463
01:24:20,688 --> 01:24:23,635
When you come, can you buy
half a kilo of 'Halwa'?

1464
01:24:24,526 --> 01:24:25,504
Will you?

1465
01:24:26,161 --> 01:24:27,299
Darling!

1466
01:24:28,329 --> 01:24:29,831
You want black or red?

1467
01:24:30,065 --> 01:24:31,237
I want red!

1468
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:32,778
Okay!

1469
01:24:33,068 --> 01:24:34,240
Don't call <i>again, okay?</i>

1470
01:24:34,836 --> 01:24:36,315
(kisses)

1471
01:24:45,880 --> 01:24:46,858
Alby

1472
01:24:49,617 --> 01:24:51,324
I'm getting really scared.

1473
01:24:52,220 --> 01:24:53,494
Why was he killed?

1474
01:25:00,829 --> 01:25:02,809
Why don't you stay at your
house for a few days?

1475
01:25:03,231 --> 01:25:05,232
It will be a change from
this atmosphere as well.

1476
01:25:05,233 --> 01:25:08,271
What are you saying? Nayana
needs some support now, right?

1477
01:25:08,336 --> 01:25:09,314
I'll manage.

1478
01:25:09,737 --> 01:25:11,683
I feel even sadder
thinking about her.

1479
01:25:12,240 --> 01:25:13,218
Poor thing.

1480
01:25:40,301 --> 01:25:43,441
The fingerprints of two people have
been identified on this pickaxe.

1481
01:25:43,738 --> 01:25:46,878
Chances are that those two people
would've taken turns to use the pickaxe.

1482
01:25:47,909 --> 01:25:50,711
What you're saying is that, two
people could be involved in this?

1483
01:25:50,712 --> 01:25:51,912
That's also a possibility.

1484
01:25:51,913 --> 01:25:52,891
Another thing;

1485
01:25:53,448 --> 01:25:58,124
These are the samples of the
sand that was on the pickaxe.

1486
01:25:58,553 --> 01:26:00,464
See, there are two
types of sand in this.

1487
01:26:00,688 --> 01:26:02,668
One is red sand from solid land;

1488
01:26:03,258 --> 01:26:06,467
and the other is black
sand from a marshy area.

1489
01:26:47,468 --> 01:26:48,446
Call them.

1490
01:26:49,204 --> 01:26:50,274
Ring the bell!

1491
01:26:51,005 --> 01:26:52,177
What is it, Sir?

1492
01:26:52,507 --> 01:26:53,679
There's no one there.

1493
01:26:53,775 --> 01:26:54,753
What is it?

1494
01:26:54,876 --> 01:26:56,476
Mr?
- Mr. Kumar.

1495
01:26:56,477 --> 01:26:57,477
Mr. Kumar,

1496
01:26:57,478 --> 01:27:00,948
we are collecting fingerprints of all the
men in this flat, to solve Sudhi's murder.

1497
01:27:01,015 --> 01:27:02,426
Why not?
Take it!

1498
01:27:02,483 --> 01:27:03,584
Come downstairs.

1499
01:27:03,585 --> 01:27:05,292
Hold this, dear.
- Make it fast!

1500
01:27:05,620 --> 01:27:06,598
Come, son.

1501
01:27:06,888 --> 01:27:07,992
Where are you taking him?

1502
01:27:08,389 --> 01:27:10,324
He is also a man, Sir.
- Just you have to come.

1503
01:27:10,325 --> 01:27:11,565
I'll also come.
- Man, it seems!

1504
01:27:11,626 --> 01:27:13,697
Then I'll tuck in my shirt <i>&</i> come.
- Come here, you.

1505
01:27:14,629 --> 01:27:16,734
Actually, did you get any
lead in this case, Sir?

1506
01:27:16,831 --> 01:27:18,833
We have got all that,
and we'll nab him soon!

1507
01:27:27,342 --> 01:27:28,650
That is Rajashekharan.

1508
01:27:28,843 --> 01:27:30,288
He was in Service earlier.

1509
01:27:30,378 --> 01:27:31,578
<i>Subaidar Raflashekharan.</i>

1510
01:27:31,579 --> 01:27:33,684
When a dog chased him,
he got scared <i>&</i> slipped.

1511
01:27:33,881 --> 01:27:34,985
He broke his leg.

1512
01:27:35,550 --> 01:27:36,654
Shall I carry him down?

1513
01:27:43,691 --> 01:27:45,693
You're senior, Chacko Sir.
You can go first.

1514
01:27:48,529 --> 01:27:50,304
Sir, let me see your hand.

1515
01:27:51,466 --> 01:27:52,444
It didn't burn, right?

1516
01:27:52,500 --> 01:27:54,002
There was a slight quiver.

1517
01:27:55,036 --> 01:27:56,014
You go first.

1518
01:27:57,705 --> 01:28:00,379
If someone in this list does
not come, note down his name.

1519
01:28:03,878 --> 01:28:05,050
Hey! What?

1520
01:28:05,913 --> 01:28:06,983
Go there <i>&</i> do it!

1521
01:28:15,890 --> 01:28:18,302
What's your name?
- Alby Mathew.

1522
01:28:21,095 --> 01:28:22,073
Alby Mathew.

1523
01:28:22,630 --> 01:28:23,608
Go ahead.

1524
01:28:39,747 --> 01:28:42,318
Sudhi Sir left the office at 2 PM.

1525
01:28:42,583 --> 01:28:45,029
He didn't come back after that;
neither did he call anyone.

1526
01:28:47,088 --> 01:28:50,123
9447975022.

1527
01:28:50,124 --> 01:28:51,728
Isn't that your number?
- Yes sir.

1528
01:28:51,926 --> 01:28:54,728
Sudhi's last phone call was
to you at 10 o'clock, right?

1529
01:28:54,729 --> 01:28:55,707
Yes sir.

1530
01:28:55,997 --> 01:28:57,999
After that?
- After that, Sir had come here.

1531
01:28:58,132 --> 01:28:59,110
At 11 AM.

1532
01:28:59,734 --> 01:29:01,475
When he was talking to me,

1533
01:29:01,602 --> 01:29:03,673
his car had an accident with a bike.

1534
01:29:06,774 --> 01:29:09,414
And he said he lost
his phone over there.

1535
01:29:09,644 --> 01:29:12,750
And he came here after dropping
the car at the service centre.

1536
01:29:13,848 --> 01:29:18,729
Phone.. Car.. Accident.
Service Centre; means"

1537
01:29:19,153 --> 01:29:20,325
it's all a mess!

1538
01:29:20,688 --> 01:29:21,666
It'll be fun!

1539
01:29:23,624 --> 01:29:26,605
Sudhi Sir said that the accident
happened at Kaloor Judges' Avenue.

1540
01:29:28,596 --> 01:29:30,041
- Yes sir. It's me.
- You?

1541
01:29:30,164 --> 01:29:32,144
Get their names <i>&</i> contact details.

1542
01:29:32,433 --> 01:29:33,878
He drove by talking
on the phone, sir.

1543
01:29:33,935 --> 01:29:35,869
And he drove off without
stopping after hitting the bike.

1544
01:29:35,870 --> 01:29:37,437
There was a huge
pool of blood here.

1545
01:29:37,438 --> 01:29:39,475
- And all of us took him to the hospital.
- Which hospital?

1546
01:29:39,540 --> 01:29:40,746
He's my sistefs husband.

1547
01:29:40,908 --> 01:29:42,979
Whoever it is, please
find him quickly.

1548
01:29:43,478 --> 01:29:45,151
We had to spend a lot of money, sir.

1549
01:29:45,513 --> 01:29:47,117
But, let my
brother-in-law come back,

1550
01:29:47,448 --> 01:29:49,155
<i>I will</i> definitely find him, Sir.

1551
01:29:50,852 --> 01:29:52,024
What's the point?

1552
01:29:52,487 --> 01:29:53,898
Everything is over, right?
- Huh?

1553
01:29:55,189 --> 01:29:56,463
He is dead, man!

1554
01:29:56,524 --> 01:29:57,502
How?

1555
01:29:57,625 --> 01:29:58,603
Okay bye.

1556
01:30:32,693 --> 01:30:34,172
Okay.
Let's talk in the evening.

1557
01:30:35,930 --> 01:30:37,136
We have brought him, Sir.

1558
01:30:50,044 --> 01:30:53,180
Is this yours? This pickaxe
has yourfingerprint on it!

1559
01:30:53,181 --> 01:30:54,660
Why did you kill him?

1560
01:30:55,583 --> 01:30:56,721
Tell me the truth!

1561
01:30:57,018 --> 01:30:57,996
Beat him up!

1562
01:31:03,157 --> 01:31:05,159
Sir, I don't know anything!
Don't hit me.

1563
01:31:05,560 --> 01:31:07,471
I don't know anything.
- Hit him again!

1564
01:31:07,528 --> 01:31:08,506
Get up!

1565
01:31:08,729 --> 01:31:10,572
Come here.
- I didn't kill him, Sir.

1566
01:31:10,798 --> 01:31:11,965
I didn't kill him sir.

1567
01:31:11,966 --> 01:31:14,105
Then whose pickaxe is this?
- It's mine, sir.

1568
01:31:14,469 --> 01:31:15,914
But I didn't kill him.

1569
01:31:15,970 --> 01:31:17,745
You better tell me
the truth quickly.

1570
01:31:17,805 --> 01:31:20,752
Or else I'll parcel your dead
body to Bengal. Understood?

1571
01:31:20,875 --> 01:31:22,609
How did this land up there then?

1572
01:31:22,610 --> 01:31:23,918
I went to bury a dog, sir.

1573
01:31:24,212 --> 01:31:25,879
Come here. What the hell..

1574
01:31:25,880 --> 01:31:27,280
I went there to bury a dog, sir.

1575
01:31:27,281 --> 01:31:29,852
If I bury a dog, I'll get Rs.500.

1576
01:31:29,917 --> 01:31:32,557
There are many dogs in
that Panchayat, sir.

1577
01:31:32,720 --> 01:31:35,530
That's how my pickaxe
landed up there, sir.

1578
01:31:37,492 --> 01:31:38,766
Put him in the lock-up!

1579
01:31:38,893 --> 01:31:40,531
Come here, you!

1580
01:31:41,195 --> 01:31:42,697
Go inside!

1581
01:31:42,763 --> 01:31:44,902
Tell me the truth!
- Don't hit me!

1582
01:31:49,604 --> 01:31:50,912
I'll trap you, you swine!

1583
01:31:58,246 --> 01:31:59,748
I spoke to that CI.

1584
01:32:00,715 --> 01:32:02,695
If there's no development
within a week,

1585
01:32:02,917 --> 01:32:04,157
he said I can leave.

1586
01:32:04,952 --> 01:32:06,192
I'm going back to Mumbai.

1587

Whatever it is,

1588
01:32:11,792 --> 01:32:13,772

Have I ever hidden

I am just disappointed
that you didn't tell me.

will my mom leave me?

Everything is solved, right?
Why are you tensed?

1599

Everyone said that.

1600
01:35:13,107 --> 01:35:14,780
Where were you?
- Washroom.

1601
01:35:14,909 --> 01:35:16,354
Program me is over. Come!
- You carry on.

Everything is gone, son!

All this is because of
that bloody Kumaran!

I want one more drink!
Come!

You should take this
body to my flat safely.

I am sorry dear.

I didn't plan to come here.

1621
01:38:19,627 --> 01:38:21,072
I came to a Church nearby.

1628
01:39:04,038 --> 01:39:05,176
I will surrender.

1629
01:39:08,375 --> 01:39:11,151
Can I spend at least two or
three more days with her?

1630
01:39:22,523 --> 01:39:24,400
That thief was innocent;

1631
01:39:24,525 --> 01:39:26,027
and still we beat him up so badly!

1632
01:39:34,001 --> 01:39:36,345
Darling!
- What is it, sweetheart?

1633
01:39:36,704 --> 01:39:38,237
Wife!
- Where are you?

1634
01:39:38,238 --> 01:39:39,342
I'm at the station!

1635
01:39:39,406 --> 01:39:41,750
Can you buy a chicken biriyani
for me when you come home?

1636
01:39:42,042 --> 01:39:43,350
Chicken biriyani!

1637
01:39:43,711 --> 01:39:46,089
How did you understand that
I'm at a biriyani shop?

1638

You're such a devil!

1639
01:39:48,782 --> 01:39:50,022
I'll bring it, okay?

1640
01:39:51,085 --> 01:39:52,223
But I'll be a little late.

1641
01:39:52,286 --> 01:39:53,560
Then give me a kiss.

1642

Bye. darling!

1643
01:39:59,259 --> 01:40:01,102
One chicken biriyani parcel!

1644

She is in her fourth month.

1645
01:40:03,530 --> 01:40:05,100
She craves for everything!

1646
01:40:05,799 --> 01:40:08,245
What a timing! She called
at the right time!

1647
01:40:09,269 --> 01:40:12,113
I want to take two days
leave and be with her.

1648
01:40:12,740 --> 01:40:15,744
Sir, if the latest forensic report
comes, won't we get much more clarity?

1649
01:40:17,277 --> 01:40:19,120
My strong suspicion is that.

1650
01:40:20,781 --> 01:40:22,624
The murderers are
within that group.

1651
01:40:23,684 --> 01:40:24,662
Hide <i>&</i> seek!

1652
01:40:33,293 --> 01:40:34,328
Change of plans.

1653
01:40:35,362 --> 01:40:39,139
I'm going to think of this
murder in a reverse order.

1654
01:40:41,068 --> 01:40:42,206
Come on.
Let's go.

1655
01:40:42,369 --> 01:40:44,212
Okay, sir.
Good night. See you tomorrow.

1656
01:40:44,271 --> 01:40:46,046
I didn't mean let's go home.

1657
01:40:46,540 --> 01:40:47,518
Come with me!

1658
01:41:04,058 --> 01:41:06,664
The body would have been hidden
during the night mostly.

1659
01:41:07,294 --> 01:41:10,138
We should know how this
place is, in the same mood.

1660
01:41:11,165 --> 01:41:13,475
Think in reverse from the
time we found the body.

1661
01:41:14,401 --> 01:41:15,379
Till 2 PM,

1662
01:41:15,469 --> 01:41:17,278
when Sudhi left his office.

1663
01:41:17,438 --> 01:41:18,416
Reverse clock.

1664
01:41:19,506 --> 01:41:21,679
<i>We have to find evidence
far wet cue day.</i>

1665
01:41:22,309 --> 01:41:26,815
We have forensic evidence that the body
was underground for the rest four days.

1666
01:41:27,281 --> 01:41:30,524
An atmosphere like soap bubbles that
formed under his skin means that,

1667
01:41:30,884 --> 01:41:34,161
the body was underground
for around 4 days.

1668
01:41:37,558 --> 01:41:39,663
There are chances that the
body was taken this way.

1669
01:41:43,831 --> 01:41:45,538
In the photos,

1670
01:41:45,799 --> 01:41:47,779
there were marks of car tyres.

1671
01:41:50,437 --> 01:41:53,418
The size of these tyre
marks has a width of 195.

1672
01:41:53,574 --> 01:41:58,250
Usually, for sedan model cars; the
tyre size would be 195-75-15.

1673
01:41:58,579 --> 01:42:00,684
So no doubt, sir.
It's a sedan.

1674
01:42:03,484 --> 01:42:05,293
That means that we should go

1675
01:42:05,886 --> 01:42:07,832
this way!
Come on! Let's go!

1676
01:42:26,740 --> 01:42:27,810
What is it, Sir?

1677
01:42:41,688 --> 01:42:45,858
Sir, we have the list of all the
vehicles that passed from 10 PM to 6AM.

1678
01:42:45,859 --> 01:42:47,960
You have the list of the vehicles
that went back as well, right?

1679
01:42:47,961 --> 01:42:49,531
Yes sir.
There are suspects.

1680
01:42:50,464 --> 01:42:51,636
Sir, please.

1681
01:42:53,667 --> 01:42:55,374
Sit down!
Please.

1682
01:42:57,271 --> 01:42:58,249
Yes, please.

1683
01:42:59,973 --> 01:43:02,579
Sir, there are hardly any vehicles
in this route during the night.

1684
01:43:03,477 --> 01:43:05,616
Tuesday night from 10 PM
to next morning 6AM,

1685
01:43:05,913 --> 01:43:07,392
how many vehicles
passed that way?

1686
01:43:07,481 --> 01:43:09,427
Sir, exactly 86 vehicles.

1687
01:43:10,617 --> 01:43:12,290
And how many of them went back?

1688
01:43:12,786 --> 01:43:13,787
Sir, 11 of them.

1689
01:43:14,454 --> 01:43:15,454
2 autos,

1690
01:43:15,455 --> 01:43:16,433
2 Innovas,

1691
01:43:16,623 --> 01:43:18,364
And?
- 3 Wagon Rs.

1692
01:43:18,592 --> 01:43:19,798
And four sedan model cars.

1693
01:43:19,860 --> 01:43:21,533
4 Sedans?
- Yes.

1694
01:43:21,995 --> 01:43:22,973
Okay.

1695
01:43:24,565 --> 01:43:26,476
I need the full details
of these 11 vehicles.

1696
01:43:26,800 --> 01:43:28,609
Within 2 hours.
On my table!

1697
01:43:28,669 --> 01:43:29,739
Okay?
- Yes sir.

1698
01:43:35,475 --> 01:43:36,647
Check the vehicle number.

1699
01:43:44,551 --> 01:43:45,689
Nayana is leaving.

1700
01:43:45,819 --> 01:43:47,230
To her sister's place.

1701
01:43:47,287 --> 01:43:49,822
The police has told her that they'll
inform her if they get any lead.

1702
01:43:49,823 --> 01:43:50,961
She can come then.

1703

Sarah!

1704
01:43:59,733 --> 01:44:00,973
What happened, Alby?

1705
01:44:02,836 --> 01:44:04,577
I want to say something.

1706
01:44:05,305 --> 01:44:06,375
Why are you crying?

1707
01:44:06,840 --> 01:44:07,818
Tell me.

1708
01:44:08,308 --> 01:44:09,286
I'll tell you.

1709
01:44:17,484 --> 01:44:19,486
Are you saying the truth?
- Yes sir.

1710
01:44:19,686 --> 01:44:21,893
Everything that I said is true!

1711
01:44:23,023 --> 01:44:28,496
Leave alone a man,
I haven't even killed a chicken in my life!

1712
01:44:29,630 --> 01:44:31,906
I was a little drunk then.

1713
01:44:32,032 --> 01:44:37,277
Subaidar Rajashekharan told us that he
saw you leaving with your car at 2 AM.

1714
01:44:37,704 --> 01:44:41,447
I saw Chackds car going
out at around 2 AM.

1715
01:44:41,708 --> 01:44:42,686
Car?

1716
01:44:42,743 --> 01:44:43,721
Me?

1717
01:44:44,678 --> 01:44:45,845
So you didn't go?

1718
01:44:45,846 --> 01:44:47,291
No sir.

1719
01:44:47,414 --> 01:44:48,392
Sure?

1720
01:44:55,355 --> 01:44:56,993

There was something which happened.

1722
01:45:18,912 --> 01:45:20,482
I'm going to surrender to the police.

1723
01:45:22,316 --> 01:45:23,989
Alby, don't do it.

1724
01:45:24,051 --> 01:45:26,292

Come!

1730
01:46:59,446 --> 01:47:00,891
Nayana, have you started?
- Yes.

1731
01:47:01,047 --> 01:47:02,993
I reached the airport.
What is it, Sir?

1732
01:47:04,418 --> 01:47:06,398
Well, we've caught the murderer.

01:47:41,888 --> 01:47:42,866
Sit down.

1737
01:47:48,895 --> 01:47:49,930
Good.

1738
01:47:50,664 --> 01:47:52,200
Listen to me calmly.

1739
01:47:55,202 --> 01:47:56,476
Sudhi was murdered

1740
01:47:57,204 --> 01:47:58,182
by Alby.

1741
01:47:59,239 --> 01:48:00,513
By strangling his neck.

1742
01:48:02,075 --> 01:48:03,486
By suffocating him.

1743
01:48:18,925 --> 01:48:20,097
You bastard!

1744
01:48:21,094 --> 01:48:22,928
Did you kill my Sud hi?

1745
01:48:22,929 --> 01:48:24,465
Hey! Leave him!
- Sorry.

1746
01:48:24,531 --> 01:48:25,635
Hold her!
- Is it you?

1747
01:48:26,666 --> 01:48:28,646
Hey! Leave him.
Come here.

1748
01:48:28,869 --> 01:48:29,847
Leave m e.

1749
01:48:29,936 --> 01:48:30,914
Leave me!

1750
01:48:35,809 --> 01:48:38,221
Even though it was the
last day to repay the loan

1751
01:48:38,278 --> 01:48:39,780
and retrieve the
gold from the bank,

1752
01:48:39,913 --> 01:48:41,614
when he couldn't
arrange the money,

1753
01:48:41,615 --> 01:48:43,595
someone brings money
to your house.

1754
01:48:44,317 --> 01:48:46,118
Since Alby had the key with him,

1755
01:48:46,119 --> 01:48:49,032
he takes the money from there for
an adjustment for a short while.

1756
01:48:49,623 --> 01:48:52,934
But after the bank procedures,
while he returns the money;

1757
01:48:53,093 --> 01:48:54,265
Sudhi comes there,

1758
01:48:54,327 --> 01:48:55,305
and sees it.

1759
01:48:56,763 --> 01:48:58,868
In the struggle which
followed with Sudhi,

1760
01:48:59,032 --> 01:49:00,010
he dies.

1761
01:49:01,234 --> 01:49:02,611
That's the actual incident.

1762
01:49:03,770 --> 01:49:04,748
<i>Right?</i>

1763
01:49:10,143 --> 01:49:12,623
This story isn't enough, Alby.

1764
01:49:12,879 --> 01:49:16,691
You know, it's not gelling.
Understood?

1765
01:49:16,783 --> 01:49:18,091
Sir, this is what happened.

1766
01:49:18,952 --> 01:49:21,125
Sir, this is what happened.

1767
01:49:23,557 --> 01:49:25,925
He died when such a
puny guy like you,

1768
01:49:25,926 --> 01:49:29,169
just pressed on his neck?

1769
01:49:30,230 --> 01:49:32,642
Am I an idiot to believe this?

1770
01:49:34,801 --> 01:49:35,939
Tell me the truth!

1771
01:49:37,938 --> 01:49:39,281
You didn't kill him alone.

1772
01:49:42,309 --> 01:49:44,789
Something which couldn't even be
detected through post-mortem,

1773
01:49:44,978 --> 01:49:46,946
something which doesn't
have a smell or taste;

1774
01:49:46,947 --> 01:49:50,019
a very rare poison which is even
more powerful than cyanide.

1775
01:49:50,951 --> 01:49:51,929
Sarin.

1776
01:49:52,752 --> 01:49:54,595
Sudhi died by consuming it.

1777
01:49:55,956 --> 01:49:57,367
Where did you get it from,Alby?

1778
01:49:58,925 --> 01:50:00,632
Who gave it to you?

1779
01:50:01,728 --> 01:50:02,706
Sir, l..

1780
01:50:03,797 --> 01:50:04,935
I don't know anything, Sir.

1781
01:50:05,799 --> 01:50:06,937
I don't know, Sir.

1782
01:50:08,068 --> 01:50:09,911
Do you know anything about this?

1783
01:50:15,375 --> 01:50:16,375
Sir..

1784
01:50:16,376 --> 01:50:17,354
You don't know?

1785
01:50:18,211 --> 01:50:19,713
You should be knowing.

1786
01:50:21,748 --> 01:50:23,284
You know it, Nayana!

1787
01:50:23,383 --> 01:50:25,158
Sir, what all are you saying?

1788
01:50:25,285 --> 01:50:26,889
Didn't he..
- Shut up!

1789
01:50:32,626 --> 01:50:33,866
You're lying, you..

1790
01:50:34,828 --> 01:50:37,035
Should I present
all the evidence?

1791
01:50:37,764 --> 01:50:40,040
Your entire call
history of your phone;

1792
01:50:41,368 --> 01:50:44,042
everything from the time you
were formed in your mom's womb;

1793
01:50:44,304 --> 01:50:45,612
I have it all with me!

1794
01:50:46,006 --> 01:50:47,041
You're messing with me?

1795
01:50:47,374 --> 01:50:48,682
You think I'm mad?

1796
01:50:51,077 --> 01:50:52,778
Sarin is a very rare poison

1797
01:50:52,779 --> 01:50:55,919
which is available only in three main
research centres in Kerala.

1798
01:50:56,983 --> 01:50:59,395
A person from one of
those research centres,

1799
01:50:59,452 --> 01:51:02,922
has received 178 calls from your
phone for the past 2 months.

1800
01:51:04,190 --> 01:51:05,635
So stop the nonsense.

1801
01:51:05,892 --> 01:51:08,304
Just tell me, why did you kill him?

1802
01:51:18,805 --> 01:51:19,783
Yes.

1803
01:51:20,240 --> 01:51:21,218
I killed him.

1804
01:51:23,810 --> 01:51:25,118
That's not the question.

1805
01:51:25,378 --> 01:51:26,356
Why?

1806
01:51:26,813 --> 01:51:28,087
Why did you kill him?

1807
01:51:32,118 --> 01:51:33,461
I have a relationship.

1808
01:51:33,820 --> 01:51:35,299
We wanted to live together.

1809
01:51:40,193 --> 01:51:41,467
How long has it been going on?

1810
01:51:41,695 --> 01:51:42,673
3 years.

1811
01:51:42,796 --> 01:51:45,106
Couldn't you finish it
with a divorce petition?

1812
01:51:49,102 --> 01:51:50,080
But how?

1813
01:51:50,470 --> 01:51:52,746
Sud hi had quite a huge bank balance, right?

1814
01:51:53,440 --> 01:51:55,044
You wanted that as well, right?

1815
01:51:56,109 --> 01:51:57,782
Did Sudhi know about
your relationship?

1816
01:51:58,511 --> 01:51:59,489
No.

1817
01:51:59,913 --> 01:52:01,119
That's rig ht!

1818
01:52:02,982 --> 01:52:04,962
The actual poison is
not Sarin or anything.

1819
01:52:05,985 --> 01:52:07,396
It's you and that
scoundrel of yours!

1820
01:52:07,987 --> 01:52:09,466
Call that b@E@#rd!
- Yes sir.

1821
01:52:10,757 --> 01:52:11,735
@#@$!

1822
01:52:14,360 --> 01:52:19,360
<i>www.desireleasers.com</i>

1823
01:52:33,213 --> 01:52:34,191
Master brain!

1824
01:52:34,514 --> 01:52:35,492
Dr. Vijay

1825
01:52:35,915 --> 01:52:37,189
Agriculture Chemist.

1826
01:52:38,318 --> 01:52:39,296
Sit down.

1827
01:52:39,953 --> 01:52:40,931
No, thanks!

1828
01:52:41,788 --> 01:52:42,926
Not to you!

1829
01:52:43,990 --> 01:52:44,968
Alby!

1830
01:52:45,525 --> 01:52:46,503
Sit down.

1831
01:52:47,927 --> 01:52:49,065
Sit down, man!

1832
01:52:50,363 --> 01:52:51,341
Move!

1833
01:52:52,799 --> 01:52:53,777
Come on!

1834
01:53:01,074 --> 01:53:02,109
Sit down, man!

1835
01:53:10,016 --> 01:53:12,189
This is the CCTV
footage of your lab.

1836
01:53:13,019 --> 01:53:15,898
When everyone else went for
tea-break at 4.30 PM,

1837
01:53:16,189 --> 01:53:17,759
you went straight to the lab.

1838
01:53:18,525 --> 01:53:19,936
To steal Sarin.

1839
01:53:24,497 --> 01:53:25,475
4.50 PM

1840
01:53:26,199 --> 01:53:27,837
You go out with the car.

1841
01:53:30,436 --> 01:53:32,177
Till then, everything is correct.

1842
01:53:33,006 --> 01:53:33,984
Tell me.

1843
01:53:34,507 --> 01:53:35,884
What happened after that?

1844
01:53:37,610 --> 01:53:40,216
When the struggle was going
on between Alby <i>&</i> Sudhi,

1845
01:53:40,613 --> 01:53:41,591
were you there?

1846
01:53:43,917 --> 01:53:46,329
How did the poison enter Sudhi's body?

1847
01:53:47,086 --> 01:53:49,396
Sudhi died within 3 minutes after
the poison entered his body.

1848
01:53:50,623 --> 01:53:52,068
Tell m e.
How?

1849
01:53:52,225 --> 01:53:53,203
I don't know.

1850
01:53:53,259 --> 01:53:54,897
You swine!
Don't mess with me!

1851
01:53:56,496 --> 01:53:58,476
Tell me!
Tell me, you bastard!

1852
01:53:58,998 --> 01:54:00,306
Tell me!
- Sir!

1853
01:54:00,533 --> 01:54:01,511
What?

1854
01:54:02,936 --> 01:54:03,914
I'll tell you.

1855
01:54:08,041 --> 01:54:09,418
On the day Sudhi died,

1856
01:54:09,542 --> 01:54:10,953
Nayana, I'm leaving.
- Okay.

1857
01:54:13,446 --> 01:54:14,424
Close the door.

1858
01:54:18,518 --> 01:54:19,929
Vijay reached the flat.

1859
01:54:25,992 --> 01:54:27,972
Just 1 or 2 grams have to go inside;

1860
01:54:28,228 --> 01:54:29,206
for him to die!

1861
01:54:29,395 --> 01:54:31,966
When Sudhi reaches here,
he has to get a call.

1862
01:54:32,265 --> 01:54:34,905
With the vibration that happens
when he attends the call,

1863
01:54:35,335 --> 01:54:37,178
the poison will enter his body.

1864
01:54:38,137 --> 01:54:39,980
And then, everything will be over.

1865
01:54:43,509 --> 01:54:46,319
It was our need to make
Sud hi reach there.

1866
01:54:47,413 --> 01:54:49,916
For that, Vijay called his office.

1867
01:54:51,918 --> 01:54:53,625
You had given your passport
for renewal, right?

1868
01:54:53,686 --> 01:54:54,664
Yes.

1869
01:54:54,921 --> 01:54:56,229
This is for the verification.

1870
01:54:57,090 --> 01:54:58,967
If I come home now,
can I see you?

1871
01:54:59,025 --> 01:55:00,595
Right now?
- Yes. Right now.

1872
01:55:01,294 --> 01:55:02,272
Within half an hour'?

1873
01:55:02,395 --> 01:55:03,396
Okay.

1874
01:55:06,366 --> 01:55:08,607
After confirming that
Sud hi reached the flat,

1875
01:55:09,002 --> 01:55:10,140
Vijay messaged me.

1876
01:55:10,403 --> 01:55:11,381
He is at home.

1877
01:55:12,238 --> 01:55:13,649
At exactly 3.15 PM,

1878
01:55:14,173 --> 01:55:18,977
a call with a duration of 9 seconds came
on your land phone, from your mobile.

1879
01:55:18,978 --> 01:55:22,187
That is, within the hour that the
murder is supposed to have happened.

1880
01:55:25,985 --> 01:55:27,019
No, Sudhi!
Don't call!

1881
01:55:27,020 --> 01:55:27,998
Leave me!

1882
01:55:29,389 --> 01:55:32,962
You thought that the death would
be considered as a natural death, right?

1883
01:55:35,395 --> 01:55:38,137
And Alby broke in there, and
disposed the body as well.

1884
01:55:39,032 --> 01:55:41,444
With that, all your hopes
went down the drain!

1885
01:55:42,368 --> 01:55:43,676
Everything was over, right?

1886
01:55:45,004 --> 01:55:46,278
What kind of a life is this?

1887
01:55:46,406 --> 01:55:50,320
You started living with some random
guy you met at a meeting 6 years back!

1888
01:55:50,743 --> 01:55:53,189
And after 3 years, you saw
this poisonous fellow!

1889
01:55:53,346 --> 01:55:54,916
You didn't need the old guy anymore!

1890
01:55:55,448 --> 01:55:57,086
And he wanted a child!

1891
01:55:57,417 --> 01:55:59,226
Didn't you abort 2 children?

1892
01:56:01,988 --> 01:56:03,262
My hands are itching!

1893
01:56:03,656 --> 01:56:04,634
Valsa!

1894
01:56:04,691 --> 01:56:05,669
Come here!

1895
01:56:08,027 --> 01:56:09,199
Take her away!

1896
01:56:09,362 --> 01:56:10,932
Take him away too!

1897
01:56:31,117 --> 01:56:33,961
You will have to go to
jail for hiding the body anyway.

1898
01:56:35,221 --> 01:56:37,394
If you try hard with
a good advocate,

1899
01:56:37,623 --> 01:56:38,727
you can get out early.

1900
01:56:39,625 --> 01:56:42,231
Consider that this is the result
of someone's prayers for you.

1901
01:56:43,129 --> 01:56:44,107
See you.

1902
01:56:45,264 --> 01:56:46,242
And ya.

1903
01:56:47,133 --> 01:56:48,578
Didn't you understand something?

1904
01:56:49,235 --> 01:56:50,680
Even if it is a matter
of life <i>&</i> death,

1905
01:56:50,770 --> 01:56:52,579
don't play around with
your wife's gold!

1906
01:56:53,706 --> 01:56:55,083
You'll be in trouble!

1907
01:56:55,775 --> 01:56:56,753
Okay?
<i>'</i> Okay,

1908
01:56:57,176 --> 01:56:58,154
Take care.

1909
01:57:08,421 --> 01:57:10,264
After a jail sentence of 3 years,

1910
01:57:10,656 --> 01:57:11,760
he is coming out.

1911
01:57:12,291 --> 01:57:15,204
His entire family is
waiting outside to receive him,

1912
01:57:15,528 --> 01:57:17,439
and to start a new life.

1913
01:57:18,064 --> 01:57:20,203
That's where we roll
the end titles, Sir.

1914
01:57:25,705 --> 01:57:27,446
I will produce this movie, man.

1915
01:57:28,474 --> 01:57:31,276
For every dream, God has
designed a recipe.

1916
01:57:31,277 --> 01:57:32,312
You will do well!

1917
01:57:35,048 --> 01:57:36,026
Come here.

1918
01:57:39,552 --> 01:57:40,758
This is a small advance.

1919
01:57:44,791 --> 01:57:46,099
The story is good;

1920
01:57:46,225 --> 01:57:47,795
there are many places
where one would cry,

1921
01:57:48,661 --> 01:57:51,642
but I have a doubt if
it's slightly classier.

1922
01:57:52,165 --> 01:57:54,166
<i>I will</i> bring it down, Sir.

1923
01:57:54,167 --> 01:57:55,271
Then don't delay it.

1924
01:57:55,334 --> 01:57:56,540
Start yourwork immediately.

1925
01:57:56,803 --> 01:57:58,146
Don't worry about the dates.

1926
01:57:58,237 --> 01:58:01,343
Well, there's a small
problem from my side, Sir.

1927
01:58:02,375 --> 01:58:05,310
I can't start this before 6 months.

1928
01:58:05,311 --> 01:58:07,188
I am on parole now.

1929
01:58:07,280 --> 01:58:08,258
On parole?

1930
01:58:16,255 --> 01:58:18,098
Okay!
- Okay Sir.

1931
01:58:29,135 --> 01:58:30,409
I committed that movie.

1932
01:58:31,370 --> 01:58:32,678
It's a small budget movie.

1933
01:58:33,339 --> 01:58:34,511
It won't cost much!

1934
01:58:35,374 --> 01:58:36,409
The boy is good!

1935
01:58:36,843 --> 01:58:39,289
I didn't like the name
of the movie so much.

1936
01:58:39,378 --> 01:58:42,359
It should have been named as
'The Lily Flowers of Jerusalem'

1937
01:58:43,149 --> 01:58:44,628
%¢:;:*:::;;Tr:e::*"

1938
01:58:44,684 --> 01:58:45,788
What's wrong with you?

1939
01:58:45,852 --> 01:58:46,830
I liked it.

1940
01:58:47,186 --> 01:58:48,426
<i>'You and I'</i>

1941
01:58:49,655 --> 01:58:53,364
And when the card that says
Director Alby Vellani appears,

1942
01:58:53,459 --> 01:58:55,097
that will be a great feeling.

1943
01:58:55,194 --> 01:58:56,867
Don't feel so great about it, Father.

1944
01:58:57,463 --> 01:58:58,533
I have told him,

1945
01:58:58,731 --> 01:59:00,870
that there's no need of this
'Vellani' along with Alby.

1946
01:59:01,234 --> 01:59:03,805
Instead of that - Script
<i>&</i> Direction by Alby ...(dot, dot,dot)

1947
01:59:04,170 --> 01:59:05,649
What are those dots for?

1948
01:59:05,705 --> 01:59:09,209
Well, Father has hurt him a lot
because he chose cinema, right?

1949
01:59:09,408 --> 01:59:10,580
That's true.

1950
01:59:11,210 --> 01:59:13,212
The Fathers are here.

1951
01:59:13,279 --> 01:59:14,257
I'm also here.

1952
01:59:14,447 --> 01:59:15,926
Dad came?
- Oh! You came?

1953
01:59:16,149 --> 01:59:17,127
Alby!

1954
01:59:17,283 --> 01:59:18,921
In the third scene,
- Sir!

1955
01:59:19,585 --> 01:59:20,563
I am here, Sir.

1956
01:59:21,487 --> 01:59:23,688
Is my scene being shot today?
- Not today. Tomorrow.

1957
01:59:23,689 --> 01:59:25,457
It's okay. I will be here.

1958
01:59:25,458 --> 01:59:26,630
Your beard is looking great.

1959
01:59:26,692 --> 01:59:27,762
Okay sir.

1960
01:59:34,400 --> 01:59:35,378
God!

1961
01:59:36,602 --> 01:59:37,945
All the best!

1962
01:59:49,815 --> 01:59:50,759
Ready!

1963
01:59:51,651 --> 01:59:52,629
Roll camera!

1964
01:59:54,420 --> 01:59:55,398
Action!

1965
01:59:58,457 --> 02:00:00,458
Father, it's us!

1966
02:00:00,459 --> 02:00:01,437
Over there.

1967
02:00:03,462 --> 02:00:05,237
Hold Sarah's hand & walk forward.

1968
02:00:05,698 --> 02:00:07,599
- No one will touch you.
- Walk with full confidence.

1969
02:00:07,600 --> 02:00:09,170
I won't allow them to touch you!

1970
02:00:09,936 --> 02:00:10,914
Cut it!

1971
02:00:11,604 --> 02:00:12,582
Superb!
