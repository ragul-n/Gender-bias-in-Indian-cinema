2
00:03:28,133 --> 00:03:30,467
- Ammini!
- Where is he?

3
00:03:30,508 --> 00:03:32,008
- Come!
- Ammini!

4
00:03:32,049 --> 00:03:35,216
- Come, come, Ammini
- Come this side

5
00:03:35,258 --> 00:03:37,383
- Come here
- Sheela, please hold this

6
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,467
Oh! Finally my boy is here.

7
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:42,049
My sweet boy,

8
00:03:44,091 --> 00:03:46,467
Keeping all these open, Where
are you going?

9
00:03:46,508 --> 00:03:48,175
You shouldn't be a Glamour Guy

10
00:03:48,216 --> 00:03:49,592
Your idiotic fashion!

11
00:03:49,633 --> 00:03:51,008
- Come Ammini, let's go
- Oh yeah!

12
00:03:51,049 --> 00:03:52,341
Ammini, Ammini, Ammini,

13
00:03:52,383 --> 00:03:53,800
Gosh! Can't you just call
me by my name?

14
00:03:53,842 --> 00:03:55,258
Am I a nursery boy?

15
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:58,467
- How Mean?
Didn't you see he's pique?

16
00:03:58,508 --> 00:04:00,175
Even if you go to Dubai
or somewhere else

17
00:04:00,216 --> 00:04:01,884
For us, you are still our 'Ammini'

18
00:04:01,925 --> 00:04:03,425
- Come
- Yeah, true

19
00:04:03,467 --> 00:04:04,425
Come my boy.

20
00:04:04,467 --> 00:04:06,800
- Walk, All of you
- Mukesha!

21
00:04:07,756 --> 00:04:09,367
Hey, Buddy!
- You too have come?

22
00:04:09,865 --> 00:04:10,359
Shajith,
my friend

23
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:11,717
Oh! My Buddy,

24
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,049
You've put on weight. Guess
you're hyper-eating

25
00:04:14,091 --> 00:04:16,508
Even you've become fairer.
Glamorous!

26
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:18,258
You can have your
small talk later.

27
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,884
Hurry up home now.

28
00:04:23,925 --> 00:04:26,467
Even if his DADDY is cast
out from this car,

29
00:04:26,508 --> 00:04:28,925
I'll not let this 'Shivasraka' fall off.
( A mantra to get suitable wife)

30
00:04:29,216 --> 00:04:32,175
That is how Mukeshan
has hooked it up.

31
00:04:36,966 --> 00:04:39,008
If you move a bit,
I could SIT and drive?

32
00:04:39,091 --> 00:04:41,175
For that, your car is too congested
dear Mukesh

33
00:04:41,258 --> 00:04:44,091
- Then, can't you catch a train instead?
- Just a 10 people overfilled your car

34
00:04:44,133 --> 00:04:45,341
How Worthless your car is?

35
00:04:45,425 --> 00:04:47,966
- True, All is my car's fault

36
00:04:48,091 --> 00:04:50,633
Sajith, This is a procession that has
come to receive you.

37
00:04:50,675 --> 00:04:51,842
Senseless!
Isn't it?

38
00:04:51,884 --> 00:04:54,383
You better stop your blabbering
and may drive instead.

39
00:04:55,219 --> 00:04:56,219
Sorry...

40
00:04:57,633 --> 00:05:00,467
- Drive straight to Mangalam
- Why there?

41
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:03,550
What a funny question?

42
00:05:07,592 --> 00:05:11,091
We've brought him straight
from the Aeroplane.

43
00:05:11,133 --> 00:05:13,925
He can't take leave
more than 2 months

44
00:05:13,966 --> 00:05:15,717
It doesn't matter at all.

45
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:19,049
I've conducted marriages of
many busy bee NRI's

46
00:05:19,091 --> 00:05:20,383
so effortlessly.

47
00:05:20,508 --> 00:05:22,633
We can move things fast.

48
00:05:22,675 --> 00:05:24,467
- Tea!
- Give it to them, Please have it.

49
00:05:24,508 --> 00:05:25,508
No, No!

50
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:27,091
He doesn't drink tea.

51
00:05:27,175 --> 00:05:28,675
Do you've milk here?

52
00:05:28,758 --> 00:05:30,425
Why is it just milk?

53
00:05:30,467 --> 00:05:32,049
Get him HORLICKS know?

54
00:05:34,091 --> 00:05:35,258
Our astrologer

55
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,049
has predicted this to
be a perfect match

56
00:05:37,091 --> 00:05:38,508
So, we need not delay.

57
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:39,675
Straight to marriage.

58
00:05:39,717 --> 00:05:41,884
- Definitely
- Marriage for whom?

59
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:45,300
For YOU my buddy,
To whom else?

60
00:05:45,341 --> 00:05:47,258
- But, I should see the girl ?
- Why?

61
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,425
We've seen her.
That's enough

62
00:05:49,467 --> 00:05:52,467
- Wanna see the girl it seems!
- You keep quiet. Let them speak

63
00:05:52,508 --> 00:05:53,884
What is your name, you told?

64
00:05:53,925 --> 00:05:56,008
'Ammini,
Amminipilla'

65
00:05:56,175 --> 00:05:57,341
Shajith

66
00:05:57,383 --> 00:05:58,717
Shajith Kumar A P

67
00:05:59,508 --> 00:06:01,758
Dear Shajith, don't get tensed.

68
00:06:01,884 --> 00:06:03,175
Did you see this?

69
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:06,133
All these were set up by Mangalam

70
00:06:06,175 --> 00:06:08,884
Mangalam has conducted all
of their marriages.

71
00:06:09,508 --> 00:06:11,508
Many of them have met their spouses,

72
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:12,925
only at their first night.

73
00:06:12,966 --> 00:06:15,758
It is called 'First Night Me Too'
in English.

74
00:06:16,049 --> 00:06:18,049
- That is true
- What true?

75
00:06:18,133 --> 00:06:19,341
I mean, the exposing..

76
00:06:19,383 --> 00:06:20,383
at First Night!

77
00:06:20,425 --> 00:06:21,592
Your daughter, daughter, daughter!

78
00:06:54,884 --> 00:07:01,842
$ Did you see the Wedding bells
of the loving Koels $

79
00:07:01,884 --> 00:07:08,884

$ This is a day of jolly huddle $

88
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:53,633
Mukesh? Is she not a
FATTY?

89
00:07:53,925 --> 00:07:57,091
Who are you talking about?

90
00:07:58,842 --> 00:08:01,550
You Silly Billy!
Poor girl she is.

91
00:08:08,216 --> 00:08:11,758
$ In the little dreams,
popping up in the eyes $

92
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:15,425
$ Bloom a thousand jazzy rainbows $

93
00:08:15,467 --> 00:08:18,884
$ This moment is that sunk in blush $

$ Mind sways in the brim of love $

95
00:08:22,467 --> 00:08:26,425
$ When the couple spread

96
00:08:26,467 --> 00:08:29,675
$ Closed their lustful eyes $

97
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:33,091
$ Shut the tilting doors,

Are all these your ideas?

112
00:10:09,133 --> 00:10:10,175
No

113
00:10:10,258 --> 00:10:11,592
Of Mukesh

114
00:10:23,912 --> 00:10:29,287
(song from old movie
plays in mobile phone)

115
00:10:29,425 --> 00:10:31,925
Are you a fan of old songs?

116
00:10:31,966 --> 00:10:32,966
Yes

117
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:35,008
I listen everything.

118
00:10:35,049 --> 00:10:36,800
Hindi is my favourite.

119
00:10:36,925 --> 00:10:39,633
Though I can't make out the meaning,
I do listen to them.

120
00:10:47,133 --> 00:10:49,425
Does everyone call you 'Ammini'?

121
00:10:51,508 --> 00:10:52,966
Who told you?

122
00:10:54,592 --> 00:10:57,633
If you don't like it, I'll call
you 'Shajiyetaa'

123
00:10:57,842 --> 00:10:59,425
Isn't it fine?

124
00:11:19,175 --> 00:11:21,341
You can call me 'Kanthi'

125
00:11:21,383 --> 00:11:23,049
Everyone calls me so.

126
00:11:25,258 --> 00:11:26,592
You sleep.

127
00:11:31,884 --> 00:11:33,467
Which side you are ?

128
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,633
WHAT?

129
00:11:36,425 --> 00:11:39,216
On which side of bed do you..?

130
00:11:39,258 --> 00:11:40,341
Here or there?

131
00:11:40,383 --> 00:11:42,091
Any side will do.
You sleep.

132
00:12:52,216 --> 00:12:53,884
What the hell?

133
00:12:53,925 --> 00:12:55,341
Mukesha,

134
00:12:56,425 --> 00:12:57,758
I'm in trouble

135
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,258
Why mate? Problems
will be there

136
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,884
Is it not your first night?

137
00:13:02,008 --> 00:13:04,842
You just need to handle
the situation wisely.

138
00:13:05,425 --> 00:13:06,842
Issue is something else.

139
00:13:07,049 --> 00:13:08,550
She is SNORING.

140
00:13:08,592 --> 00:13:10,008
Let her snore dear.

141
00:13:10,049 --> 00:13:13,091
There is nothing serious as long as
she is not taking Marijuana

142
00:13:13,925 --> 00:13:16,258
Keep the phone,
For God's sake.

143
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:17,763
Hello?? Hello..??

144
00:13:29,049 --> 00:13:30,925
That stupid spoiled my sleep.

145
00:13:31,008 --> 00:13:32,884
Snoring it seems!

146
00:13:35,383 --> 00:13:36,592
Vanaja,

147
00:13:36,633 --> 00:13:37,758
Dear Vanaja,

148
00:13:37,884 --> 00:13:38,966
Hey Vanaja,

149
00:13:39,925 --> 00:13:41,550
Dammit!

150
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,592
Which package do you prefer?

151
00:13:54,966 --> 00:13:56,425
Will go for a cooler place.

152
00:13:57,341 --> 00:13:58,925
What if we go to Munnar?

153
00:13:58,966 --> 00:14:00,425
Chill it is!

154
00:14:01,008 --> 00:14:02,592
- Is it the Honeymoon package itself?
- Yes!

155
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:04,592
Then, we'll go for Munar

156
00:14:04,633 --> 00:14:08,008
- How much is for the package?
- You get it from 17,000

157
00:14:08,049 --> 00:14:09,258
Number of days is up to you.

158
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,925
So, which one do you prefer?

159
00:14:11,008 --> 00:14:13,091
3 days would be fine?
Or shall we go for 4?

160
00:14:15,091 --> 00:14:16,258
So, Fix it.

161
00:14:17,341 --> 00:14:19,925
Total amount is Rs.21,000

162
00:14:20,633 --> 00:14:22,216
Wanna go for a Honeymoon

163
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:23,925
Wanna book it here.

164
00:14:24,175 --> 00:14:25,842
Why are you staring at us?

165
00:14:25,884 --> 00:14:27,383
Not for us, But for him

166
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:29,807
You tell me.

167
00:14:29,832 --> 00:14:33,852
Paris, Kulu Manali, Lakshwadeep,
Ooty, Kodaikanal, Munnar..

168
00:14:34,049 --> 00:14:35,467
Which package do you prefer?

169
00:14:35,508 --> 00:14:36,437
Pazhani!
( A pilgrim centre)

170
00:14:36,555 --> 00:14:37,336
Pazhani?

171
00:14:39,049 --> 00:14:40,675
Don't you offer trip to Pazhani?

172
00:14:41,049 --> 00:14:42,341
That is enough.

173
00:15:51,905 --> 00:15:52,905
Here

174
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:55,300
Shajith, Dear..

175
00:15:56,091 --> 00:15:57,758
I wanna buy something.

176
00:16:20,675 --> 00:16:23,008
Bro, how much?

177
00:16:26,925 --> 00:16:29,633
Bro, What is this for?

178
00:16:29,675 --> 00:16:31,925
To postpone periods,
that's all

179
00:16:46,133 --> 00:16:47,925
Couldn't you buy it there itself?

180
00:16:48,425 --> 00:16:49,884
Just to embarrass me

181
00:16:51,508 --> 00:16:53,550
I was terribly humiliated.

182
00:16:53,574 --> 00:17:13,574
<font color="#00ff00">Complete Subtitles Exclusively Arranged by:-</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Samaksh ~ Varsha ~ Pankaj Jain</font>

183
00:18:48,966 --> 00:18:52,758
Order your favourite dish and
eat them, all of you

184
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,258
Applicable to you as well

185
00:18:58,884 --> 00:19:00,383
- Bro
- Tell me

186
00:19:00,425 --> 00:19:02,175
Can I get chicken roll here?

187
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,550
This is a vegetarian restaurant.

188
00:19:06,717 --> 00:19:08,842
Then, for me,
a MASALA DOSA will do.

189
00:19:08,884 --> 00:19:10,467
For me also, a masala dosa

190
00:19:10,508 --> 00:19:12,216
Ammini, what do you want?

191
00:19:12,258 --> 00:19:13,508
For me, a Coffee

192
00:19:13,592 --> 00:19:14,758
Alas!
COFFEE?

193
00:19:15,008 --> 00:19:16,175
No way!

194
00:19:16,216 --> 00:19:18,008
- Milk is there?
- Yes madam

195
00:19:18,383 --> 00:19:19,800
Coffee will 'DO'

196
00:19:21,049 --> 00:19:23,550
Hey, get him a Coffee.
Problem Solved right?

197
00:19:24,633 --> 00:19:25,758
Annachi,

198
00:19:26,133 --> 00:19:28,300
Get me an Oothappam
and Vada here

199
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:29,383
Get me 2 vadas

200
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,884
Mom,

201
00:19:37,258 --> 00:19:38,675
Don't you want vada?

202
00:19:46,925 --> 00:19:49,633
- How's Masala? Delicious?
- Noop, It's Substandard!

203
00:19:50,175 --> 00:19:52,049
I need a DIVORCE!

204
00:20:16,592 --> 00:20:19,008
Dammit! Did I crack
any Joke now?

205
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:24,550
I'm damn serious.
I want DIVORCE

206
00:21:02,066 --> 00:21:03,858
Hearty Greetings Sir,

207
00:21:03,899 --> 00:21:05,191
No need to howl out.

208
00:21:05,233 --> 00:21:06,400
Aren't you a Robber?

209
00:21:06,442 --> 00:21:08,150
You're not here winning
elections right?

210
00:21:08,566 --> 00:21:10,316
Any grievance against police?

211
00:21:10,358 --> 00:21:11,941
What a question sir?

212
00:21:11,983 --> 00:21:13,191
Can't have a single complaint.

213
00:21:13,233 --> 00:21:14,400
They are so loving.

214
00:21:14,442 --> 00:21:16,108
As sweet as honey

215
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:18,649
Aren't they the gems who we
meet almost everyday?

216
00:21:18,983 --> 00:21:20,191
What is the offense?

217
00:21:20,216 --> 00:21:23,128
Theft, Your Honor. I appear
from the side of prosecution

218
00:21:26,358 --> 00:21:29,170
Prosecutor may sit.  I'll read
- Yes

219
00:21:30,394 --> 00:21:31,394
Yes?

220
00:21:31,696 --> 00:21:33,623
I am here for
the accused, Your Honor.

221
00:21:33,649 --> 00:21:34,649
Yes, yes.

222
00:21:35,576 --> 00:21:38,459
The stolen property and the place of..
- Yes, yes. Come to the point.

223
00:21:38,483 --> 00:21:40,233
Come to the point,
dear advocate

224
00:21:40,863 --> 00:21:42,058
Kindly grant the bail.

225
00:21:42,108 --> 00:21:43,427
Have you filed the
bail application?

226
00:21:43,558 --> 00:21:44,286
Yes!

227
00:21:44,311 --> 00:21:46,375
I am strongly opposing
the bail application, your honor.

228
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,649
Why the hell is it for?

229
00:21:47,691 --> 00:21:49,191
Hey lawyer, TWO thefts
in a shot!

230
00:21:49,275 --> 00:21:50,524
Let him enjoy the jail for
a couple of days.

231
00:21:50,566 --> 00:21:52,066
Isn't there a limit for theft?

232
00:21:52,108 --> 00:21:53,733
Nothing like that dear judge.

233
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:55,566
The story is mistold

234
00:21:55,607 --> 00:21:56,474
Oh! Is it?

235
00:21:56,552 --> 00:21:57,459
That's...

236
00:21:57,483 --> 00:21:58,844
To be frank,

237
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Speak!

238
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:01,774
I'm a Socialist

239
00:22:01,983 --> 00:22:03,483
The truth is that,

240
00:22:03,566 --> 00:22:05,607
I had gone to Muthappan's
Temple to steal.

241
00:22:05,649 --> 00:22:07,858
There, the HUNDIAL was
too kinda small

242
00:22:07,899 --> 00:22:10,066
When I hit-broke the hundial, only
PETTY cash was there

243
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:11,733
Just a few coins

244
00:22:12,316 --> 00:22:14,400
I was truly disappointed.
Infact, DISHEARTENED

245
00:22:14,442 --> 00:22:17,566
- Then, didn't you take it?
- eh...eh..I Took it.

246
00:22:17,733 --> 00:22:20,150
But my inner consciousness says that

247
00:22:20,233 --> 00:22:21,733
I being a socialist,

248
00:22:22,025 --> 00:22:24,607
Isn't it shameful to steal
from one god alone?

249
00:22:24,774 --> 00:22:26,858
So, I went to the very next church

250
00:22:26,941 --> 00:22:28,816
Broke the hundial there and
took the cash in it

251
00:22:28,858 --> 00:22:31,816
and put it in the previous
hundial to make them equal.

252
00:22:31,858 --> 00:22:33,316
He is OUR god right?

253
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,400
Isn't it bad to show
Bias to our god?

254
00:22:36,483 --> 00:22:38,566
These are all little things
that I've done.

255
00:22:40,952 --> 00:22:44,181
The bail application for the accused
stands dismissed!

256
00:22:44,285 --> 00:22:47,254
The accused is remanded in
custody for 14 days.

257
00:22:47,281 --> 00:22:48,547
Sir, he's innocent!

258
00:22:48,816 --> 00:22:50,358
Innocent? How stupid?

259
00:22:50,442 --> 00:22:52,858
It is DURING his theft, the police caught
him, that too with the MAINOUR

260
00:22:52,899 --> 00:22:54,483
Then, what is the logic in claiming
that he is Innocent?

261
00:22:54,524 --> 00:22:55,607
That will be seen during the trial!

262
00:22:55,952 --> 00:22:56,577
Yes.

263
00:22:56,682 --> 00:22:57,202
Next case.

264
00:22:57,306 --> 00:22:59,285
Your Honor, kindly reconsider
the bail.

265
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:00,310
No, no. Next!

266
00:23:02,733 --> 00:23:04,108
Oh! Poor me.

267
00:23:09,108 --> 00:23:10,524
Lawyer, Lawyer,
hey Lawyer,

268
00:23:10,607 --> 00:23:12,025
Where is the bail lawyer?

269
00:23:12,066 --> 00:23:13,899
You only promised me
bail using your tongue?

270
00:23:14,524 --> 00:23:16,442
Why the hell did you speak
about Socialism there?

271
00:23:16,483 --> 00:23:17,816
Isn't it that created
the Problem?

272
00:23:17,858 --> 00:23:19,275
Don't dare to act stupid

273
00:23:19,539 --> 00:23:20,251
That's right.

274
00:23:20,275 --> 00:23:21,774
Yeah! True that I was
Damn HONEST!

275
00:23:21,899 --> 00:23:23,691
What is the bloody use of it?

276
00:23:23,733 --> 00:23:25,774
Robbers should never ever
be this honest.

277
00:23:25,816 --> 00:23:26,733
Do you get me?

278
00:23:26,858 --> 00:23:29,233
Now, Do one thing.
Spend a 2 weeks in jail

279
00:23:29,275 --> 00:23:30,733
- It will be a CHANGE for you.
- What damn change do you mean?

280
00:23:30,774 --> 00:23:32,941
Then you also come with me. Even
YOU can have a change.

281
00:23:33,191 --> 00:23:34,649
Can you just leave?

282
00:23:34,691 --> 00:23:37,275
I'll somehow get you bail
on the next date.

283
00:23:37,316 --> 00:23:38,483
God knows!

284
00:23:41,774 --> 00:23:42,983
Hey Sura,

285
00:23:43,316 --> 00:23:44,566
I'll come in the evening.

286
00:23:44,607 --> 00:23:45,858
We'll plan it together.

287
00:23:47,483 --> 00:23:49,108
Inform everyone in our group as well

288
00:23:49,941 --> 00:23:51,607
Just a few things after
getting out from here.

289
00:23:51,649 --> 00:23:52,649
After that, I'll be there.

290
00:23:53,941 --> 00:23:54,941
OK dear

291
00:23:55,649 --> 00:23:56,858
Pradeep Bro,

292
00:23:56,899 --> 00:23:59,316
I've sent a client to you

293
00:23:59,358 --> 00:24:00,566
my acquaintant

294
00:24:00,774 --> 00:24:01,941
What is the matter?

295
00:24:01,983 --> 00:24:03,483
All that, you deal yourself.

296
00:24:03,524 --> 00:24:04,941
It was a case that
came to my senior

297
00:24:04,983 --> 00:24:06,483
that I routed it to you.

298
00:24:06,649 --> 00:24:08,899
Then you also join me.
Even you are sitting JOBLESS, Isn't it?

299
00:24:08,941 --> 00:24:10,941
I wanna accompany that FATTY
to the Magistrate Court.

300
00:24:10,983 --> 00:24:13,774
- Which Fatty?
- Who else, my Senior!

301
00:24:13,899 --> 00:24:15,983
- Then OK
- You proceed

302
00:24:16,358 --> 00:24:18,442
Please call me once
you make this deal.

303
00:24:19,025 --> 00:24:20,941
If I'm right, Aren't you
our charming Peelakkul Hamsa?

304
00:24:21,191 --> 00:24:22,442
Yes, I'm

305
00:24:22,483 --> 00:24:24,649
BRO, We're your hard core fans

306
00:24:25,275 --> 00:24:28,698
We just love your music.

307
00:24:28,941 --> 00:24:30,358
Which is your next Album?

308
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,483
Next one.., Aren't you following
my Facebook page?

309
00:24:32,566 --> 00:24:35,025
- Didn't you see our new posters?-
- Oh! New posters are out?

310
00:24:35,733 --> 00:24:37,899
" Isaloor Eenthapazhavum Monjathi
Fathimem" ( Name of the Album)

311
00:24:37,941 --> 00:24:39,899
Give me a feedback
after listening to it.

312
00:24:41,524 --> 00:24:43,025
Impossible!

313
00:24:43,316 --> 00:24:44,941
This will not work out.

314
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:47,066
Both of you just GET OUT.

315
00:24:47,108 --> 00:24:48,150
Fast! Fast!

316
00:24:48,233 --> 00:24:50,150
Dear lawyer, don't risk us

317
00:24:50,233 --> 00:24:52,983
ALL the lawyers we meet,
are saying the same.

318
00:24:53,191 --> 00:24:54,066
- So what?

319
00:24:54,108 --> 00:24:56,233
- This is concerned with the
marital life of young man

320
00:24:56,275 --> 00:24:57,774
Please give a try atleast.

321
00:24:57,816 --> 00:25:00,649
Please understand brother, getting
divorce is not that easy.

322
00:25:00,691 --> 00:25:02,691
There are certain grounds for it.

323
00:25:02,774 --> 00:25:05,025
Saying that my wife Snores,

324
00:25:05,066 --> 00:25:07,983
she Over Eats, she is Fatty,
you can't go there

325
00:25:08,025 --> 00:25:09,691
The Judge will throw us out.

326
00:25:10,796 --> 00:25:12,514
Get it?
- To get what?

327
00:25:12,749 --> 00:25:14,016
Turn on the switch!

328
00:25:16,864 --> 00:25:18,064
Looking at this...

329
00:25:18,858 --> 00:25:21,774
After marriage, to apply for divorce,
there is a minimum period of one year.

330
00:25:22,358 --> 00:25:24,316
- How long have you been married?
- 8 and a half

331
00:25:24,483 --> 00:25:26,899
- 8 and a half years?
- No, Months

332
00:25:27,395 --> 00:25:29,061
8 and half months?

333
00:25:29,275 --> 00:25:30,275
Ah! Best!

334
00:25:30,358 --> 00:25:31,816
Shove Off you!
I've better things to do in life.

335
00:25:31,858 --> 00:25:33,233
Go, go, go!

336
00:25:33,899 --> 00:25:37,275
Dear lawyer, PLEASE do
something about this

337
00:25:39,816 --> 00:25:41,191
If you want, I can do one thing

338
00:25:41,233 --> 00:25:42,649
I'll give you a number

339
00:25:42,733 --> 00:25:44,150
You better visit there.

340
00:25:44,233 --> 00:25:46,316
A good counselling will
solve your problem

341
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,483
It's not for counselling,
we've come here.

342
00:25:48,566 --> 00:25:50,358
I know better ways than this.

343
00:25:50,442 --> 00:25:52,358
Aren't there plenty of
lawyers under the sky?

344
00:25:54,066 --> 00:25:56,442
Very true! You better
approach them.

345
00:25:56,899 --> 00:25:58,899
I can't take up this case.

346
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:09,442
God bless you!

347
00:26:15,275 --> 00:26:18,607
You see, we Thalassery natives
are too kinda hospitable

348
00:26:19,066 --> 00:26:20,483
To those who visit our homes,

349
00:26:20,566 --> 00:26:22,774
before asking 'WHO, WHAT',

350
00:26:22,816 --> 00:26:25,233
Did you eat? Did you drink? etc.

351
00:26:25,275 --> 00:26:27,233
would be asked by the Mothers
here at Thalassery.

352
00:26:27,275 --> 00:26:30,025
The Thalassery natives have
their own Stern opinion

353
00:26:30,108 --> 00:26:32,649
about each and everything
under the sky.

354
00:26:32,816 --> 00:26:35,191
To ask them stories and to
have some small talks,

355
00:26:35,233 --> 00:26:37,983
I'm here, travelling with
a few questions

356
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:40,899
So, today's journey starts here.

357
00:26:41,448 --> 00:26:42,292
Ready?

358
00:26:42,316 --> 00:26:43,316
Yes?

359
00:26:43,358 --> 00:26:44,607
So today,

360
00:26:44,649 --> 00:26:51,400
we're at a baker's laboratory,
that is 150 years old.

361
00:26:51,442 --> 00:26:55,150
We can see a scientist here,
Let's go and speak to him

362
00:27:52,275 --> 00:27:53,941
For marriages at Thalasery,

363
00:27:53,983 --> 00:27:58,607
Just before serving Biriyani,
you get a tasty and rich dish

364
00:27:58,656 --> 00:28:00,256
Our one and only, Salsa!

365
00:28:01,066 --> 00:28:03,607
Not 'Salsa',
It is 'Alsa'

366
00:28:16,066 --> 00:28:19,275
We are standing at the center
of Thalassery market.

367
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,483
Let's ask these Thalassery natives,

368
00:28:21,566 --> 00:28:24,108
of what they've so much to
talk about Thalassery

369
00:28:25,816 --> 00:28:28,358
Here, we can see a vibrant
young brother.

370
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,442
wearing an elegant
wrinkle-free shirt.

371
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,442
Bro,

372
00:28:33,483 --> 00:28:35,649
We're from Thalassery Vision.

373
00:28:36,025 --> 00:28:38,483
This is a show named
'Thalassery Peruma'

374
00:28:38,524 --> 00:28:41,150
Can you tell us something
about Thalassery?

375
00:28:41,316 --> 00:28:43,816
What is there so much to
speak about Thalassery?

376
00:28:43,941 --> 00:28:45,733
Anything simple will do.

377
00:28:45,774 --> 00:28:49,025
Simply saying, there are
a lot of programs about Thalassery

378
00:28:49,108 --> 00:28:51,649
- That is not a problem.
- Yes! it is!

379
00:28:51,774 --> 00:28:54,816
Especially, to a responsible
citizen like me,

380
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:56,400
when you get a platform like this,

381
00:28:56,442 --> 00:28:59,150
anything I speak should be beneficial
to the place and its natives

382
00:28:59,941 --> 00:29:01,524
That, you can say even later.

383
00:29:01,566 --> 00:29:04,233
Did you see the vegetables
sold in this market?

384
00:29:04,275 --> 00:29:06,400
This is all poison.

385
00:29:06,483 --> 00:29:10,483
This poison is what we
consume everyday.

386
00:29:10,566 --> 00:29:11,983
Do not stop shooting.
You continue.

387
00:29:12,025 --> 00:29:15,191
They are something that we can
grow at our OWN homes.

388
00:29:15,316 --> 00:29:16,774
Where is your house, sister?

389
00:29:16,899 --> 00:29:18,483
- Enough! Enough! Let's go
- Do not go like that

390
00:29:18,607 --> 00:29:20,483
Let your house be anywhere under
the sky, doesn't matter.

391
00:29:20,649 --> 00:29:22,691
Behind it, legumes, lady's finger,

392
00:29:22,733 --> 00:29:24,316
tomato, bitter guard etc.

393
00:29:24,358 --> 00:29:26,442
They can be grown so effortlessly.

394
00:29:26,483 --> 00:29:27,858
It is very easy.

395
00:29:27,983 --> 00:29:30,233
Without getting wasted like this,

396
00:29:30,275 --> 00:29:32,442
can't you just do something
good like this?

397
00:29:32,483 --> 00:29:34,649
- Alright Mr.Clean!
- Hey, are you cross with me?

398
00:29:36,233 --> 00:29:37,774
Get me a half Kg of
Cabbage as well.

399
00:29:37,858 --> 00:29:39,858
Very sorry, I don't have SUCH
vegetables that you want.

400
00:29:39,899 --> 00:29:41,233
All contain POISON

401
00:29:41,275 --> 00:29:42,524
I was just kidding man.

402
00:29:42,566 --> 00:29:44,233
Those I've said for a punch.

403
00:29:44,275 --> 00:29:46,108
But you were Punching on
our Chest indeed.

404
00:29:46,733 --> 00:29:48,025
110

405
00:29:50,691 --> 00:29:52,691
I'll give 10 Rupees later.

406
00:29:57,841 --> 00:30:06,694
(people chatting while playing carrom)

407
00:30:08,691 --> 00:30:09,899
Pradeep bro has come.

408
00:30:09,983 --> 00:30:12,191
Pradeep bro, sit!
Let's play a game.

409
00:30:12,316 --> 00:30:13,858
Sorry all, a lot of work is pending

410
00:30:13,983 --> 00:30:15,566
- Kanakan bro is here?
- Yes! Go upstairs.

411
00:30:15,855 --> 00:30:16,818
Hey, Pradeep!
- Yes.

412
00:30:16,843 --> 00:30:17,843
Are you really going?

413
00:30:18,199 --> 00:30:19,733
This humour never lacks

414
00:30:19,762 --> 00:30:22,574
(People continue playing
carrom and chatting)

415
00:30:23,486 --> 00:30:24,486
Kanakan!

416
00:30:25,941 --> 00:30:28,316
What surprise is in your hands?
Vegetables ?

417
00:30:28,358 --> 00:30:29,899
Do you have SUCH habits as well?

418
00:30:29,941 --> 00:30:33,400
Without some tricks like this,
I can't withstand at home

419
00:30:33,483 --> 00:30:34,649
Hey! I guessed it

420
00:30:34,733 --> 00:30:37,191
Being Good is not
your cup of tea.

421
00:30:37,233 --> 00:30:39,941
At home, they've started saying
that I'm not responsible

422
00:30:39,983 --> 00:30:41,233
I want to correct it.

423
00:30:42,316 --> 00:30:44,275
Do the veggies contain
'Vitamin Responsibility'?

424
00:30:44,316 --> 00:30:46,233
Shut your mouth man.

425
00:30:47,316 --> 00:30:48,442
See this,

426
00:30:48,566 --> 00:30:49,566
see

427
00:30:50,191 --> 00:30:51,483
Read it aloud

428
00:30:54,316 --> 00:30:59,275
# While being DEAF to the tracks of time #

429
00:30:59,316 --> 00:31:01,316
What is this?
A poem?

430
00:31:02,442 --> 00:31:04,483
Pradeepa, you only read it.

431
00:31:04,566 --> 00:31:08,150
They are SLOGANS!
He is not capable to lift it up.

432
00:31:08,566 --> 00:31:09,816
Kanakan bro,

433
00:31:09,858 --> 00:31:11,025
I'll do one thing.

434
00:31:11,066 --> 00:31:13,233
I'll just go home
and come back.

435
00:31:13,649 --> 00:31:16,066
Hey, don't leave. Are you
doing a Fair Escape?

436
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:18,483
- You first finish writing it
- No, no, I'm also coming

437
00:31:18,524 --> 00:31:20,191
This will get over now.

438
00:31:20,269 --> 00:31:22,469
Pradeep, See you later.
- Later.

439
00:31:22,816 --> 00:31:25,691
Pradeepa, just a minute.
Wanna say something.

440
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,899
What is it?

441
00:31:30,035 --> 00:31:31,035
That's...

442
00:31:31,816 --> 00:31:33,442
There is a small problem.

443
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:37,191
This time, In the 8th ward,

444
00:31:37,442 --> 00:31:41,191
Party has confirmed the candidature
of Sajeevan, who lives in Chokli.

445
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:44,483
He is a reputable person.

446
00:31:44,816 --> 00:31:47,025
How mean is this,
Kanakan bro?

447
00:31:48,108 --> 00:31:49,358
You please try your best

448
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,858
If I don't get a seat atleast now,
I won't be able to stand

449
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:54,483
That's true.

450
00:31:55,025 --> 00:31:56,025
But,

451
00:31:56,691 --> 00:31:59,649
You're not that famous know?
That is the problem.

452
00:32:00,191 --> 00:32:02,524
So what?
I'm a BA, LLB holder.

453
00:32:02,566 --> 00:32:03,858
Yeah! That's true.

454
00:32:04,233 --> 00:32:06,150
Pradeepa, you leave now.

455
00:32:06,233 --> 00:32:07,774
I'll pressurize them.

456
00:32:07,941 --> 00:32:09,316
Kindly do it bro,

457
00:32:10,316 --> 00:32:11,774
I hope you know
my condition?

458
00:32:18,607 --> 00:32:20,566
Did he invite you for
his marriage?

459
00:32:20,774 --> 00:32:24,066
- Babu! from Chandoth...
- Oh him?

460
00:32:24,191 --> 00:32:25,774
Is the petrol over?

461
00:32:27,691 --> 00:32:29,025
Step down.

462
00:32:29,358 --> 00:32:32,025
Oh, Pradeep bro,

463
00:32:32,358 --> 00:32:34,566
Are you still crazy of this?

464
00:32:36,358 --> 00:32:38,233
Isn't it a fun?

465
00:32:57,858 --> 00:32:59,066
Come bro,

466
00:32:59,108 --> 00:33:00,649
Enough of it.

467
00:33:01,816 --> 00:33:03,025
Is it not over?

468
00:33:03,066 --> 00:33:04,191
Let's go

469
00:33:07,816 --> 00:33:10,275
What is the use of writing
on these walls?

470
00:33:10,566 --> 00:33:11,983
You wait and see,

471
00:33:12,066 --> 00:33:14,191
I'll definitely win a
seat this term.

472
00:33:14,233 --> 00:33:16,025
This is what you told in the
previous election as well.

473
00:33:16,275 --> 00:33:18,108
But, It is sure this time.

474
00:33:34,281 --> 00:33:35,947
(Dram serial plays on TV)

475
00:33:45,983 --> 00:33:48,066
Fantastic! Have You also
started watching it?

476
00:33:48,649 --> 00:33:50,941
It's fun. You watch a
little and see.

477
00:33:51,941 --> 00:33:54,400
My loving bro, Don't you have
any better job to do?

478
00:33:54,607 --> 00:33:56,774
Can't you wash your hands
and start eating?

479
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,649
Why did you embarass her
from the market?

480
00:34:00,816 --> 00:34:02,858
Oh! She served it on your
table as well?

481
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:04,983
I shined well in
the market today.

482
00:34:05,108 --> 00:34:06,983
Finish eating and come,
I have kept something in retaliation.

483
00:34:09,566 --> 00:34:11,899
Bring me the urn
of the chilli dish.

484
00:34:12,025 --> 00:34:13,566
Only 'URN' is there.
Nothing is left.

485
00:34:13,816 --> 00:34:15,649
How was today's Marital First
meeting with the girl?

486
00:34:15,983 --> 00:34:18,358
Tragic my dear.
Nothing is working out

487
00:34:18,816 --> 00:34:20,025
Prakashan, my boy,

488
00:34:20,066 --> 00:34:22,858
Can't you take a girl out from somewhere
along the line and marry, Like him?

489
00:34:22,899 --> 00:34:24,983
I don't have ANY problem.

490
00:34:26,191 --> 00:34:28,066
I see only that possibility
left for you.

491
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:29,774
Are you aware of your age?

492
00:34:30,483 --> 00:34:31,899
Oh my god!

493
00:34:32,108 --> 00:34:34,358
Why are you people reminding
me of my age very often?

494
00:34:34,607 --> 00:34:37,442
I'm just 38+
That's not a big age

495
00:34:37,691 --> 00:34:39,899
Don't try to make me a
fool out of it, OK?

496
00:34:39,941 --> 00:34:41,275
It's just that you can
convince youself saying so

497
00:34:41,316 --> 00:34:42,774
All your hair has fallen off

498
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:44,150
Lemme see it.

499
00:34:44,191 --> 00:34:46,607
No need. I'll do
Hair Fixing.

500
00:34:47,649 --> 00:34:49,941
Prakash bro, Don't do it OK?
It will be so boring.

501
00:34:49,983 --> 00:34:51,607
The STYLE lies in this.

502
00:34:51,649 --> 00:34:53,566
You are our 'Kunjako Boban' right?
( Actor )

503
00:34:54,691 --> 00:34:55,858
Is it?

504
00:34:55,941 --> 00:34:59,191
It's better you people stop
fooling me around. OK?

505
00:35:00,191 --> 00:35:02,816
This year, Prakashan will
definitely get married.

506
00:35:03,649 --> 00:35:05,983
Hope it is not like Him claiming
to get a seat everytime

507
00:35:06,191 --> 00:35:10,275
- That was a cool one Mommy,
- Today, In which side are you?

508
00:35:13,025 --> 00:35:14,316
Get me some pickle,
you stupid.

509
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,774
Good for nothing!

510
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,858
Didn't you put salt in this curry?

511
00:35:23,899 --> 00:35:25,607
That's enough for you.

512
00:35:28,629 --> 00:35:30,087
Shamsu, what are
you saying now?

513
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:31,459
Haven't I said earlier?

514
00:35:31,483 --> 00:35:33,417
IMPOSSIBLE Shamsu!
No, no, no!

515
00:35:33,442 --> 00:35:35,400
You should never send
him to me again.

516
00:35:36,483 --> 00:35:38,316
He is a little MAD

517
00:35:39,691 --> 00:35:41,150
What is his name?

518
00:35:41,233 --> 00:35:42,691
Some Girl's name know?

519
00:35:42,816 --> 00:35:44,150
'Ammini'

520
00:35:44,524 --> 00:35:46,442
That name itself is problematic.

521
00:35:54,233 --> 00:35:55,923
Shajith, what are you doing?

522
00:35:55,948 --> 00:35:57,584
Who's there?
- No one, no one!

523
00:35:57,858 --> 00:35:59,316
What are you doing?
Don't act foolish.

524
00:35:59,358 --> 00:36:00,733
Just a minute,
lemme finish it off?

525
00:36:05,774 --> 00:36:07,316
Leave me alone.

526
00:36:07,483 --> 00:36:08,983
Don't act like a MAD.
Get into the vehicle.

527
00:36:09,524 --> 00:36:12,066
Get in! Get in!
I say, Get in!

528
00:36:12,847 --> 00:36:13,981
Hey, who's there?

529
00:36:14,191 --> 00:36:15,442
No one, no one

530
00:36:21,691 --> 00:36:27,191
# While being DEAF to the tracks of time #

531
00:36:27,233 --> 00:36:34,150
# When the world laughs
at your foolishness #

532
00:36:34,191 --> 00:36:37,691
# When it calls you BARBARIC #

533
00:36:37,774 --> 00:36:41,233
# We'll shout up with enthusiasm #

534
00:36:41,275 --> 00:36:42,566
' Inquilab Sindabad'

535
00:36:42,691 --> 00:36:48,733
Up with the revolution !
Up with the revolution !

536
00:36:48,941 --> 00:36:50,483
- Where are you going?
- To there.

537
00:36:50,607 --> 00:36:52,358
There is Lathy charge and
Police intervention.

538
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,400
Do you think you can escape
if anything goes wrong?

539
00:36:54,442 --> 00:36:55,649
You better sit here.

540
00:36:56,691 --> 00:36:59,025
There is no problem here, as of now.
If anything goes wrong,

541
00:36:59,108 --> 00:37:00,816
- We'll take action for sure
- See, this Advocate Pradeep Kumar..??

542
00:37:00,858 --> 00:37:02,066
Go man, GO!

543
00:37:02,442 --> 00:37:04,108
- Sorry sir, I was replying
someone else here.

544
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:05,649
# ......calls you BARBARIC #

545
00:37:05,691 --> 00:37:09,358
# We'll shout out with enthusiasm #

546
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:12,400
# Inquilab Zindabad #

547
00:37:12,442 --> 00:37:15,816
# We'll shout out with enthusiasm #

548
00:37:15,858 --> 00:37:19,691
# Up with the Revolution #
# Up with the Revolution #

549

# Inquilab Zindabad! Inquilab Zindabad #
# Inquilab Inquilab Inquilab Zindabad #

550
00:37:29,607 --> 00:37:32,816
# Up with the Revolution #

551
00:37:50,816 --> 00:37:53,400
I came with Ammini,
AMMINI...,,!!!

552
00:37:53,483 --> 00:37:55,025
Don't beat, don't beat, don't beat !
I'm arrested.

553
00:37:55,066 --> 00:37:56,316
I'm arrested

554
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,483
Your ridiculous Dharna.

555
00:38:12,899 --> 00:38:14,607
Oh! All are here ?

556
00:38:35,025 --> 00:38:36,358
Why getting wasted ?

557
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,691
Will see you at club
in the evening

558
00:38:37,733 --> 00:38:39,150
How you'll go?
Do you've vehicle?

559
00:38:39,191 --> 00:38:41,316
- That's ok, You leave
- Then, OK

560
00:38:42,774 --> 00:38:44,607
By the by, what to
do with him?

561
00:38:46,566 --> 00:38:48,649
You catch an auto now,
I'll come

562
00:38:48,733 --> 00:38:50,524
See you

563
00:38:51,649 --> 00:38:53,691
Can't you understand
what I say ?

564
00:38:53,733 --> 00:38:55,400
Why are you after me?

565
00:38:56,566 --> 00:38:57,858
Jobless!

566
00:38:58,150 --> 00:38:59,816
Pradeepa, Let's have a tea.

567
00:38:59,899 --> 00:39:02,066
No, thanks. You have It.
I've work

568
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:03,774
Your BEATING!
Stars bulged out of our eyes.

569
00:39:03,858 --> 00:39:05,733
Leave it. Apply a little
therapeutic oil

570
00:39:05,774 --> 00:39:06,649
It will be alright.

571
00:39:06,691 --> 00:39:08,191
- OK Sir,
-  lemme go?

572
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:13,691
For god's sake, go and see
some other advocate

573
00:39:13,733 --> 00:39:15,816
I can't take up this case.
This is a CLOSED chapter.

574
00:39:15,899 --> 00:39:18,483
We've already seen many advocates.
Nothing worked out.

575
00:39:18,566 --> 00:39:21,358
- Why is it so?
- That you better ask him.

576
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,566
But, where is he?

577
00:39:22,691 --> 00:39:24,108
He's there

578
00:39:36,275 --> 00:39:38,442
Your adamancy will
not find fruits.

579
00:39:38,566 --> 00:39:41,524
With your reasons, you're not
going to get divorce also.

580
00:39:41,816 --> 00:39:43,733
How can one tell things which
is not there?

581
00:39:43,858 --> 00:39:45,442
I can't LIE

582
00:39:45,607 --> 00:39:47,150
Get him off from my sight,
will you?

583
00:39:47,233 --> 00:39:49,150
Don't ever bring him to me,
you leave, leave!

584
00:39:49,233 --> 00:39:51,400
You shouldn't open your
bloody mouth. He'll dictate.

585
00:39:51,649 --> 00:39:52,691
Advocate,

586
00:39:52,733 --> 00:39:54,774
You please tell, please

587
00:39:55,316 --> 00:39:56,816
I'll take up the case.

588
00:39:56,858 --> 00:39:58,025
But,

589
00:39:58,066 --> 00:40:00,150
But, I'll write the reasons
for the divorse.

590
00:40:00,191 --> 00:40:03,691
In today's world, a case will not
stand without strong grounds.

591
00:40:03,816 --> 00:40:05,150
Tell me if it is OK?

592
00:40:05,607 --> 00:40:07,983
It is OK,
OK only.

593
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:10,483
If it is OK,

594
00:40:10,733 --> 00:40:12,483
Come to my office tomorrow
and sign the Petition.

595
00:40:12,858 --> 00:40:14,858
But, Fees will be high

596
00:40:14,899 --> 00:40:16,607
I'll charge Exorbitant Rates

597
00:40:21,191 --> 00:40:22,816
Pay for this as well.

598
00:40:45,435 --> 00:40:48,936
Never heard of such an
advocate in Thalassery

599
00:40:52,102 --> 00:40:55,310
No allegations stipulated
in this will withstand.

600
00:40:55,352 --> 00:40:58,394
I will simply Weed Out This
advocate from the scene

601
00:40:58,435 --> 00:40:59,477
Happy?

602
00:40:59,727 --> 00:41:02,143
We're not aware of why
Shajith wants a divorce?

603
00:41:02,727 --> 00:41:04,978
Leave it. Even
She doesn't know.

604
00:41:05,019 --> 00:41:06,394
That's the Mystery here.

605
00:41:06,435 --> 00:41:08,561
Some Gobshites are like that.

606
00:41:08,727 --> 00:41:11,310
Be courageous for now. OK?

607
00:41:11,519 --> 00:41:14,852
I BET this R.P. will give back your
husband in Your hands.

608
00:41:17,102 --> 00:41:20,143
Your LOVE is even more powerful
than the LAW prevailing here.

609
00:41:20,227 --> 00:41:22,477
Everything said in it are
FAKE, dear advocate.

610
00:41:22,561 --> 00:41:24,435
I know it better than you.

611
00:41:24,686 --> 00:41:27,519
These advocates spin up stories

612
00:41:27,769 --> 00:41:29,769
We'll pay him back in
the same coin.

613
00:41:30,644 --> 00:41:32,686
Send here a 3 Black Tea

614
00:41:33,561 --> 00:41:35,352
You please wait a bit.

615
00:41:36,811 --> 00:41:39,019
What dirty names did the
petitioner call you?

616
00:41:39,102 --> 00:41:40,352
He didn't call me anything.

617
00:41:40,394 --> 00:41:42,561
'HE CALLED'. You should
say that he has done so.

618
00:41:42,602 --> 00:41:44,477
- Don't get confused.
- Yeah, I get it.

619
00:41:44,561 --> 00:41:45,602
Rinna,

620
00:41:45,727 --> 00:41:48,394
You please go there and
read out the Counter

621
00:41:51,852 --> 00:41:53,352
- Have you learnt?
- Yes, I've.

622
00:41:53,435 --> 00:41:54,686
Ok, then tell me.

623
00:41:54,811 --> 00:41:56,936
What did they call you?

624
00:41:57,727 --> 00:41:59,310
He called me a 'DOG'

625
00:42:00,936 --> 00:42:02,227
In the aforesaid case,

626
00:42:02,269 --> 00:42:05,227
The reply that the respondent
Kanthi Shivadasan gives

627
00:42:05,686 --> 00:42:09,019
1. Excluding those stipulated
in the following,

628
00:42:09,102 --> 00:42:13,102
This respondent defends all other
claims made by the petitioner.

629
00:42:13,185 --> 00:42:15,227
2. The claims made by the Petitioner

630
00:42:15,269 --> 00:42:17,894
are FAKE and BASELESS.

631
00:42:18,019 --> 00:42:20,978
3. Post marriage till now,

632
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:23,269
due to the disinterest of
the Respondent,

633
00:42:23,310 --> 00:42:26,143
Since, the Petitioner Sajith
Kumar Amminipilla

634
00:42:26,269 --> 00:42:30,060
and the Respondent haven't had
any Physical relationship

635
00:42:30,102 --> 00:42:32,227
the marital relation has not
culminated in its full and

636
00:42:32,269 --> 00:42:33,934
the Respondent has been indifferent
to the sexual needs of the Petitioner

637
00:42:34,169 --> 00:42:35,959
is NOT TRUE.

638
00:42:51,477 --> 00:42:53,894
$ You are my Princess $

639
00:42:55,644 --> 00:42:58,477
$ You are my Love $

640
00:42:59,477 --> 00:43:03,435
$ You enrich my Fantasies $

641
00:43:23,185 --> 00:43:28,060
$ The Autumn wind winnowing its way
through the mango orchard $

642
00:43:28,102 --> 00:43:32,602
$ Hugs the dusty storm,
Strips down the mangoes of LOVE $

643
00:43:32,644 --> 00:43:41,060
$ Seeking mate,
For a misty girl, of butterfly wings $

644
00:43:41,602 --> 00:43:46,269
$ When the chuckles of wedding night,
Poses a blush on her cheeks $

645
00:43:46,310 --> 00:43:49,978
$ The fate lay up,
A  painful parting $

646
00:43:50,019 --> 00:43:54,519
$ But, this silence tears me off,
My mate $

647
00:43:54,561 --> 00:43:59,769
$ Why has this Love splintered,
Into distant pieces of sly lives $

648
00:43:59,811 --> 00:44:17,769
$ Without you I remain, As
a hapless unsung song $

649
00:44:17,811 --> 00:44:27,019
$ I wait for you my love,
Till my breath fades away $

650
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:31,019
$ To the eternal rest $

651
00:44:31,102 --> 00:44:35,894
$ Till my breath fades away,
To the eternal rest $

652
00:45:03,561 --> 00:45:12,060
$ The colours fade away on the skies,
When the doodling clouds overturn $

653
00:45:12,477 --> 00:45:22,019
$ Squandered before blooming,
The flowers of little dreams $

654
00:45:22,102 --> 00:45:31,060
$ Like an outlying row boat,
In her river of Tears $

655
00:45:31,102 --> 00:45:39,644
$ When she searches,
The greener coast $

656
00:45:39,686 --> 00:45:44,852
$ She burns inside $

657
00:45:52,567 --> 00:45:53,567
Sir!

658
00:45:54,391 --> 00:45:55,391
Sir?

659
00:45:55,416 --> 00:45:56,416
Huh?

660
00:45:57,394 --> 00:45:58,727
Do you've Coin?

661
00:45:59,936 --> 00:46:01,269
One Rupee coin

662
00:46:03,936 --> 00:46:05,143
Give it to me.

663
00:46:10,102 --> 00:46:11,394
Are you a New Face?

664
00:46:12,686 --> 00:46:15,019
I'm asking you whether you are
a new recruit? - Yes sir.

665
00:46:15,602 --> 00:46:17,852
- Where is your native place?
- Here itself.

666
00:46:18,292 --> 00:46:19,292
Ohh..

667
00:46:22,519 --> 00:46:24,227
Eat Well OK?

668
00:46:24,644 --> 00:46:25,936
Be a CHIC

669
00:46:26,352 --> 00:46:28,936
You've to be a Glamour puss
in this uniform

670
00:46:28,995 --> 00:46:29,995
Hmm.

671
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:31,365
You may leave.
- Sir.

672
00:46:33,761 --> 00:46:34,761
Hello

673
00:46:35,227 --> 00:46:36,686
Did Kiddie go to school ?

674
00:46:38,143 --> 00:46:39,435
What is special for lunch today?

675
00:46:40,561 --> 00:46:41,894
Salmon?

676
00:46:42,019 --> 00:46:43,352
Indian Salmon?

677
00:46:43,602 --> 00:46:44,978
Awesome!

678
00:46:45,727 --> 00:46:47,102
Apply chilli and prepare it.

679
00:46:47,519 --> 00:46:50,143
Partition it and add a
little of Pepper

680
00:46:50,519 --> 00:46:51,894
Keep it in a low flame till
it becomes a paste.

681
00:46:52,310 --> 00:46:53,519
Hey, Hang on!

682
00:46:54,686 --> 00:46:56,185
Before you take it off the flame,

683
00:46:56,519 --> 00:46:58,477
Pour a little of Coconut oil to it.

684
00:46:59,794 --> 00:47:00,794
okay?

685
00:47:21,227 --> 00:47:24,394
MC 412/18, Hamsa,

686
00:47:24,561 --> 00:47:25,769
Amina,

687
00:47:35,227 --> 00:47:36,435
Why is this Hamsa?

688
00:47:36,602 --> 00:47:38,477
Are you not bound to
compensate your First wife?

689
00:47:38,519 --> 00:47:40,602
Then, why did you do a
second marriage?

690
00:47:40,686 --> 00:47:41,936
Are you playing a Joke?

691
00:47:42,019 --> 00:47:43,519
I'm out of cash right now,
that is why

692
00:47:47,394 --> 00:47:48,307
How much?

693
00:47:48,412 --> 00:47:51,094
Yes. Five thousand
per month, Your Honor.

694
00:47:51,519 --> 00:47:52,894
Can't you afford such a petty amount?

695
00:47:52,936 --> 00:47:54,811
You please come down a little.

696
00:47:55,143 --> 00:47:56,852
- Me?
- Not YOU.

697
00:47:56,936 --> 00:47:58,727
Please lessen something
from this 5000.

698
00:47:58,894 --> 00:48:01,269
If I pay her 5000, I'll have to pay
5000 to the second one also.

699
00:48:01,394 --> 00:48:02,769
Am I not a Human Being?

700
00:48:02,811 --> 00:48:04,310
Don't I've to Eat? Drink?

701
00:48:04,352 --> 00:48:06,519
Atleast, I need money to
fill petrol in my vehicle?

702
00:48:07,435 --> 00:48:10,644
Please come down from
5000 to Rs.1500.

703
00:48:11,143 --> 00:48:12,811
1500? What you mean?

704
00:48:12,852 --> 00:48:14,102
Even you've a wife know?

705
00:48:14,143 --> 00:48:16,060
Don't you know the expense it would
come up to, for looking after her?

706
00:48:16,102 --> 00:48:18,310
Please imagine my condition
of having TWO Wives?

707
00:48:18,352 --> 00:48:19,811
Adding Rs.500,

708
00:48:20,019 --> 00:48:21,686
Fix it at Rs.2000

709
00:48:22,435 --> 00:48:23,686
Please do some Adjustment.

710
00:48:23,811 --> 00:48:25,185
* ADJUSTMENT ? *

711
00:48:25,227 --> 00:48:26,394
Here in this court ?

712
00:48:26,435 --> 00:48:27,477
Hamsa, do one thing,

713
00:48:27,519 --> 00:48:28,811
Move to the rear end of
the room and wait

714
00:48:28,852 --> 00:48:30,227
What an UNSHAKABLE
man are you?

715
00:48:30,269 --> 00:48:31,978
Please UNDERSTAND
what I'm saying.

716
00:48:39,310 --> 00:48:41,394
OP 160/18

717
00:48:41,504 --> 00:48:43,301
Petitioner Shajith Kumar
Amminipilla

718
00:48:43,352 --> 00:48:45,019
Respondent
Kanthi Sivadhasan

719
00:49:01,477 --> 00:49:02,644
R.P. ?

720
00:49:03,060 --> 00:49:04,519
Good to go?

721
00:49:07,019 --> 00:49:08,143
Got a new vehicle ?

722
00:49:08,185 --> 00:49:09,936
Saw you in a stylish Crysta

723
00:49:10,019 --> 00:49:11,352
How can a person like me
buy Crysta and all?

724
00:49:11,394 --> 00:49:12,561
It is my brother's car

725
00:49:12,602 --> 00:49:14,310
For us, where from the blue
can have so much money?

726
00:49:14,352 --> 00:49:15,701
OK OK.
I'll pretend to believe for now.

727
00:49:15,805 --> 00:49:16,805
Your Honor.

728
00:49:18,227 --> 00:49:19,852
Where are the parties?

729
00:49:22,550 --> 00:49:25,016
Please grant a plead for
counselling

730
00:49:28,060 --> 00:49:29,477
Is it not just one year?

731
00:49:29,686 --> 00:49:31,519
Can't you negotiate and
solve your issues?

732
00:49:35,227 --> 00:49:37,978
If this is the case, how many
times we would've divorced?

733
00:49:41,143 --> 00:49:43,602
Will send them for counselling.
After all nothing bothers me?

734
00:50:18,644 --> 00:50:20,185
In the line, 'Ramanan
ka Prem' right?

735
00:50:20,227 --> 00:50:21,519
Pain! Pain!

736
00:50:21,602 --> 00:50:23,602
A little more PAIN should come.

737
00:50:24,352 --> 00:50:25,561
Right from Ramanan.

738
00:50:26,394 --> 00:50:29,602
Dear advocate, why should
I need a Counselling?

739
00:50:29,769 --> 00:50:32,477
Kindly avoid all these
and get me the Divorce

740
00:50:33,644 --> 00:50:34,686
What Nonsense?

741
00:50:34,727 --> 00:50:36,310
This a Procedure at court.

742
00:50:36,936 --> 00:50:39,269
Is it a Pizza to get
it at your order?

743
00:50:43,519 --> 00:50:46,019
This counselling is just
for a NAME SAKE.

744
00:50:46,102 --> 00:50:48,269
They'll try their maximum
to put you down.

745
00:50:48,310 --> 00:50:49,561
Then, what should YOU do?

746
00:50:49,686 --> 00:50:51,352
You should never get
caught by them.

747
00:50:51,477 --> 00:50:54,143
I'll dictate you how
to perform there

748
00:50:54,227 --> 00:50:55,727
What will I speak there?

749
00:50:56,269 --> 00:50:57,978
You dare speak anything
and everything there.

750
00:50:58,019 --> 00:50:59,394
If you want, call them some
bad words as well.

751
00:50:59,435 --> 00:51:00,602
Oh God, Bad words?

752
00:51:01,727 --> 00:51:03,227
I don't know any bad word.

753
00:51:04,102 --> 00:51:06,352
- That Mukesh will teach you.
- Isn't it?

754
00:51:06,435 --> 00:51:08,435
Why not? You just tell me
which TYPE you want.

755
00:51:10,143 --> 00:51:11,894
You should perform with VIGOUR

756
00:51:11,936 --> 00:51:13,310
Like an M.N. Nambiar

757
00:51:13,352 --> 00:51:14,227
Who is that?

758
00:51:19,644 --> 00:51:21,102
So Annoying! Can you
switch it off?

759
00:51:26,143 --> 00:51:27,561
Pradeep bro, How is
the song?

760
00:51:30,769 --> 00:51:32,978
Gosh! How do you people
tolerate him also?

761
00:51:37,269 --> 00:51:40,143
See, you are absolutely free to
talk anything you want

762
00:51:40,269 --> 00:51:42,811
I will not record it.

763
00:51:44,227 --> 00:51:45,852
You feel free here.

764
00:51:46,644 --> 00:51:48,644
You don't have to bother
your advocates.

765
00:51:48,894 --> 00:51:50,936
They just wanna get
Fees from you.

766
00:51:51,310 --> 00:51:53,852
This is just your LIFE.

767
00:51:54,727 --> 00:51:57,394
So, you are the Ultimate
Decision Makers.

768
00:52:00,477 --> 00:52:02,269
Let's go and have a tea?

769
00:52:03,394 --> 00:52:04,644
Let it get over, bro?

770
00:52:05,102 --> 00:52:06,644
It will take Time.

771
00:52:07,102 --> 00:52:08,477
You just wait

772
00:52:09,978 --> 00:52:11,727
I understood why you are tensed.

773
00:52:11,852 --> 00:52:15,686
If they reunite,
you're finished.

774
00:52:17,811 --> 00:52:20,352
The Fees will just remain
as a DREAM.

775
00:52:20,477 --> 00:52:22,727
You Kiddo, It's better you fill
your mouth with tea.

776
00:52:22,852 --> 00:52:25,352
Advocate, I guess we're
into a Hornet's Nest.

777
00:52:28,519 --> 00:52:30,019
His DAD

778
00:52:30,102 --> 00:52:31,811
I ask you, where is our BOY?

779
00:52:32,477 --> 00:52:33,936
Who?

780
00:52:34,310 --> 00:52:35,561
Who are you?

781
00:52:35,644 --> 00:52:37,602
- What you want?
- Don’t you know, you filthy!

782
00:52:37,852 --> 00:52:40,185
Let's have an OPEN talk.

783
00:52:40,519 --> 00:52:43,019
Let all of your emotions overflow.

784
00:52:43,143 --> 00:52:44,477
Whatever it may be?

785
00:52:45,102 --> 00:52:46,435
Why such a delay?

786
00:52:48,185 --> 00:52:49,477
Tell me Ammini,

787
00:52:49,519 --> 00:52:51,310
How dare you call me Ammini?

788
00:52:51,352 --> 00:52:53,561
Was Me kept on your Frigging
Lap when I was named?

789
00:52:54,019 --> 00:52:55,769
You better call your
husband, Ammini.

790
00:52:55,852 --> 00:52:57,769
You Spook-Eyed Vampire!

791
00:52:58,978 --> 00:53:00,852
I neither want your
Bootless counselling

792
00:53:00,894 --> 00:53:02,310
nor a Life with her

793
00:53:02,394 --> 00:53:03,477
Do you know,

794
00:53:03,519 --> 00:53:04,936
On the 4th day after marriage,

795
00:53:04,978 --> 00:53:06,894
She sent me to buy
Stupid tablets.

796
00:53:06,936 --> 00:53:09,185
Eating! Eating! Eating!
This is the only thing she knows.

797
00:53:09,936 --> 00:53:11,394
FATTY DUMBO!

798
00:53:13,519 --> 00:53:15,143
We'll find a way for all these.

799
00:53:15,227 --> 00:53:17,310
- You please be seated first.
- You don't have to Beef-up things.

800
00:53:17,435 --> 00:53:19,060
The saint, 'Mother Teresa'

801
00:53:23,143 --> 00:53:24,602
I'll have a second marriage.

802
00:53:24,644 --> 00:53:25,978
You get me?
Do You?

803
00:53:26,102 --> 00:53:27,269
Let me...##

804
00:53:32,644 --> 00:53:34,561
You come here.
You! You! You!

805
00:53:34,602 --> 00:53:36,894
Hey! Hey! Hey! Leave him!
This is COURT

806
00:53:37,811 --> 00:53:39,019
Who are you to say that?

807
00:53:39,019 --> 00:53:40,727
I'm his Advocate and
he is my Client.

808
00:53:40,769 --> 00:53:43,686
That's the thing. You're the one
who spoiled him, right?

809
00:53:58,019 --> 00:53:59,602
WE are the ones who
got him married.

810
00:53:59,644 --> 00:54:01,143
We know how he should live.

811
00:54:01,227 --> 00:54:02,727
You don't have to CRIPPLE
in between. OK?

812
00:54:02,769 --> 00:54:05,143
If at all you're coming,
come with her.

813
00:54:05,269 --> 00:54:07,352
Otherwise, don't even dare to come
near the boundary of our house.

814
00:54:07,394 --> 00:54:08,477
Did you hear me?

815
00:54:08,894 --> 00:54:10,143
Did you hear?

816
00:54:15,686 --> 00:54:17,477
You don't have to get
scared for all these.

817
00:54:17,686 --> 00:54:19,185
This is a part of it.

818
00:54:20,894 --> 00:54:22,394
What happened inside?

819
00:54:23,019 --> 00:54:24,185
Did you ROCK?

820
00:54:25,602 --> 00:54:26,978
Hey! Tell me the Matter.

821
00:54:27,435 --> 00:54:29,310
I'll charge you a little high.

822
00:54:29,561 --> 00:54:30,894
These are all Extras.

823
00:54:31,019 --> 00:54:32,978
- Higher than this?
- Why a doubt?

824
00:54:35,894 --> 00:54:37,477
'Fathima 3' is gonna launch.

825
00:54:37,561 --> 00:54:39,727
Is there no end for
THIS Tragedy?

826
00:54:39,978 --> 00:54:41,185
See you in the evening

827
00:54:46,686 --> 00:54:48,811
His Brainless friends!
Haughty Chap!

828
00:54:48,894 --> 00:54:50,435
Nothing of his stupid belongings
should be kept here

829
00:54:50,477 --> 00:54:52,269
Hey, How ruthless are you?

830
00:54:52,310 --> 00:54:53,852
You shouldn't be seen here anymore.

831
00:54:54,019 --> 00:54:55,477
Let him live for himself.

832
00:54:55,519 --> 00:54:56,894
You shut your mouth.

833
00:54:57,019 --> 00:54:58,894
- Where else is there for me to go?
- Anywhere you wish.

834
00:54:58,978 --> 00:55:01,143
Born just to embarrass others.
Get Lost.

835
00:55:01,644 --> 00:55:03,019
You all listen !

836
00:55:03,019 --> 00:55:04,185
After winning a divorce,

837
00:55:04,227 --> 00:55:05,852
marrying a girl of MY choice,

838
00:55:05,894 --> 00:55:07,102
I'll come HERE itself.

839
00:55:07,143 --> 00:55:09,185
Come back here, You HAUGHTY?

840
00:55:09,644 --> 00:55:11,394
- Definitely
- Will see

841
00:55:14,876 --> 00:55:17,143
What's his problem?
- Let him go!

842
00:55:18,352 --> 00:55:20,477
When the world is Globalizing,

843
00:55:20,519 --> 00:55:22,435
in the third world countries,

844
00:55:22,561 --> 00:55:24,602
Autocracy, Illiteracy,

845
00:55:24,727 --> 00:55:26,644
Downfall of Democracy,

846
00:55:26,686 --> 00:55:28,227
accompanied by challenges
like Poverty,

847
00:55:29,185 --> 00:55:30,519
Drought,

848
00:55:30,602 --> 00:55:32,060
Epidemics etc.

849
00:55:32,227 --> 00:55:34,310
will spur up.

850
00:55:34,352 --> 00:55:36,310
And from its peak...

851
00:55:36,602 --> 00:55:38,394
Hey, what the Heck is this?

852
00:55:38,477 --> 00:55:40,769
I'm speaking infront
of the laymen,

853
00:55:40,852 --> 00:55:42,561
and not in Polit Bureau.

854
00:55:43,435 --> 00:55:45,978
You do one thing,
make it simple

855
00:55:46,602 --> 00:55:48,727
Her crazy Downfall
and Third World!

856
00:55:48,769 --> 00:55:51,102
This is the maximum that I can
do in a short notice.

857
00:55:51,143 --> 00:55:53,769
You yourself write it,
I've better jobs.

858
00:55:54,686 --> 00:55:56,102
Don't cross with me munchkin.

859
00:55:56,143 --> 00:55:57,602
I was just kidding.

860
00:56:00,561 --> 00:56:03,519
What is there so
much to Chuckle?

861
00:56:03,602 --> 00:56:05,644
Are you not saturated enough?

862
00:56:05,727 --> 00:56:07,019
That's OK.

863
00:56:11,106 --> 00:56:12,106
Hello?

864
00:56:14,978 --> 00:56:15,978
What?

865
00:56:24,435 --> 00:56:27,060
Pradeepa, Go fast! Otherwise,
things would worsen.

866
00:56:27,102 --> 00:56:28,852
- Where is he?
- He's there

867
00:56:46,978 --> 00:56:48,477
What the hell are
you doing here?

868
00:56:48,519 --> 00:56:49,894
Do you wanna hit the skids?

869
00:56:52,143 --> 00:56:53,811
Is this a lodge?

870
00:56:54,644 --> 00:56:56,310
They threw me out of
my house, Advocate.

871
00:56:56,352 --> 00:56:57,936
Then, what the hell
brought you here?

872
00:56:57,978 --> 00:56:59,435
Can't go to Mukesh.

873
00:56:59,477 --> 00:57:01,060
He's living with his family.

874
00:57:08,602 --> 00:57:09,769
This will not work out.

875
00:57:09,811 --> 00:57:11,060
You look for some
other place to stay.

876
00:57:11,185 --> 00:57:12,227
I've taken up only your CASE

877
00:57:12,269 --> 00:57:14,310
And not a package including you.

878
00:57:14,477 --> 00:57:16,519
You leave, Get lost from here.

879
00:57:16,644 --> 00:57:18,561
I don't have any
other friends here.

880
00:57:18,602 --> 00:57:21,060
I don't care all that.
This is my Office.

881
00:57:21,561 --> 00:57:24,019
You just Clear out.
Go! Go! Go!

882
00:57:29,019 --> 00:57:30,060
Advocate,

883
00:57:30,310 --> 00:57:32,852
Till I find some other place, let
me stay here for some days?

884
00:57:33,727 --> 00:57:35,811
That's OK with you.
I know it.

885
00:57:41,394 --> 00:57:43,727
Can't you clean all these,
Advocate?

886
00:57:43,978 --> 00:57:46,143
See the dirt in all these.

887
00:57:47,227 --> 00:57:48,727
Move a bit.

888
00:57:56,561 --> 00:57:57,644
By the way,

889
00:57:57,894 --> 00:57:59,185
How did you get in?

890
00:57:59,227 --> 00:58:00,852
When the key is with me?

891
00:58:01,644 --> 00:58:02,894
Hey Buddy,

892
00:58:03,185 --> 00:58:04,894
Did you break it open?

893
00:58:07,894 --> 00:58:10,102
You are not as innocent as
I thought earlier.

894
00:58:12,769 --> 00:58:14,143
You read it and study.

895
00:58:14,519 --> 00:58:18,019
These are questions that might come
from the opposite side during prosecution.

896
00:58:18,102 --> 00:58:19,477
Nothing to worry.

897
00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:21,019
It's just like an exam only.

898
00:58:21,602 --> 00:58:24,019
- Wazzup? Studied?
- It's over.

899
00:58:24,644 --> 00:58:26,769
You better take a glance
outside and come.

900
00:58:27,394 --> 00:58:29,310
Let her learn it without distraction.

901
00:58:30,227 --> 00:58:33,602
Just repeat whatever
being stated in it. OK?

902
00:58:34,060 --> 00:58:35,727
The rest, I'll manage.

903
00:58:37,838 --> 00:58:40,171
Good Morning!
- Huh? Good Morning!

904
00:58:41,115 --> 00:58:43,240
Pradeep bro, Where were you?

905
00:58:43,282 --> 00:58:44,324
Come dear.

906
00:58:44,407 --> 00:58:46,365
Even didn't get to see you in
the club for 2 days?

907
00:58:46,449 --> 00:58:48,698
Don't we have to
plan the Procession?

908
00:58:48,740 --> 00:58:50,157
Is this the THING
you told us?

909
00:58:52,407 --> 00:58:53,657
Eat! Eat!

910
00:58:55,490 --> 00:58:56,907
Is it Spicy?

911
00:58:57,865 --> 00:58:59,365
Drink water, if you want.

912
00:59:03,157 --> 00:59:04,073
Alas!

913
00:59:04,115 --> 00:59:06,157
Did your Mom add Chilly to it?

914
00:59:06,199 --> 00:59:07,365
Yes.

915
00:59:11,157 --> 00:59:12,157
Hey!

916
00:59:12,657 --> 00:59:15,324
These are the probable questions that
R.P. Advocate can ask you.

917
00:59:15,365 --> 00:59:16,698
Read and Study it.

918
00:59:17,199 --> 00:59:18,240
Here it is. Teach him.

919
00:59:18,282 --> 00:59:20,365
Tomorrow is very important
for your case

920
00:59:20,407 --> 00:59:22,407
Prosecution Stage is what decides
the direction of the case.

921
00:59:22,449 --> 00:59:23,616
- Do you get me?
- Yes

922
00:59:23,657 --> 00:59:26,032
Oh! You both!
Don't make him panic

923
00:59:26,073 --> 00:59:27,240
No, I was just explaining the fact.

924
00:59:27,282 --> 00:59:29,073
You should say only those things
that  I've dictated to you.

925
00:59:29,115 --> 00:59:30,823
Even if R.P. advocate bombard
you with questions,

926
00:59:30,865 --> 00:59:32,407
You shouldn't loose the focus.

927
00:59:33,115 --> 00:59:34,907
You should never utter
nonsense there.

928
00:59:35,490 --> 00:59:38,490
Advocate, what if he asks me something
that you've not taught?

929
00:59:38,574 --> 00:59:41,115
It is a Judicious question.
He has wisdom.

930
00:59:42,490 --> 00:59:43,990
Even if he asks anything like that,

931
00:59:44,032 --> 00:59:46,574
you should meticulously look
at Pradeep bro's hands

932
00:59:46,781 --> 00:59:49,199
without getting noticed by the
Judge and the opposition. OK?

933
00:59:50,157 --> 00:59:53,449
If I show like this ONE
time, it means 'Yes'

934
00:59:53,490 --> 00:59:56,449
If I pat like this TWO times,
it is 'No'. Got it?

935
00:59:58,157 --> 00:59:59,698
Shamsu will teach you religiously.

936
00:59:59,740 --> 01:00:02,157
- He is not going tonight.
- But, let Us go Buddy.

937
01:00:02,324 --> 01:00:03,990
Pradeep bro, Please consider
that I'm a Celebrity

938
01:00:04,032 --> 01:00:04,948
Even I know it.

939
01:00:06,698 --> 01:00:09,449
- Hey, get it to me and go.
- It was somewhere here.

940
01:00:09,781 --> 01:00:12,574
- Candles are somewhere in the corner.
- Oh! That our Great Celebrity will find.

941
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:15,407
Take care of This Kiddo, OK?

942
01:00:15,490 --> 01:00:17,490
Oh dear Ammini, you stop
exploring the plate and

943
01:00:17,574 --> 01:00:18,990
help me in searching candles.

944
01:00:19,032 --> 01:00:20,073
Oh yeah!

945
01:00:52,625 --> 01:00:58,406
(Crowd and Lawyers
chattering in the court)

946
01:00:59,657 --> 01:01:02,199
OP 160/18

947
01:01:03,490 --> 01:01:05,574
Petitioner Sajith Kumar Amminipilla,

948
01:01:05,698 --> 01:01:08,199
Respondent Kanthi Shivadasan.

949
01:01:14,032 --> 01:01:14,848
Is it a CROSS?

950
01:01:14,952 --> 01:01:16,019
Yes, Your Honor!

951
01:01:16,324 --> 01:01:17,657
Do you want Encam?

952
01:01:17,713 --> 01:01:20,246
My client requests Encam,
Your Honor.

953
01:01:20,698 --> 01:01:22,240
If so, tell everyone to go outside.

954
01:01:22,616 --> 01:01:24,324
Move outside, All of you

955
01:01:26,073 --> 01:01:27,490
Fast!
Go! Go! Go!

956
01:01:37,907 --> 01:01:39,032
Move,

957
01:01:39,115 --> 01:01:40,574
You shouldn't stand here.

958
01:01:44,282 --> 01:01:45,907
Move! Move!
Move! Move!

959
01:01:48,948 --> 01:01:50,532
You come and stand here.

960
01:02:00,157 --> 01:02:02,115
Didn't I tell you not to
peep into the room?

961
01:02:02,157 --> 01:02:03,616
Go away from here.

962
01:02:07,990 --> 01:02:09,407
What is your name?

963
01:02:10,365 --> 01:02:11,532
That I know.

964
01:02:11,616 --> 01:02:12,907
Tell me your fullname.

965
01:02:15,407 --> 01:02:17,657
Shivadas is your Father's name right?

966
01:02:17,740 --> 01:02:20,032
Why didn't you add your husband's
name with your name?

967
01:02:22,698 --> 01:02:25,282
Is it a mandate to add husband's
name with wife's ?

968
01:02:25,616 --> 01:02:27,698
Your name itself is
Pradeepan Manjodi, right?

969
01:02:28,157 --> 01:02:30,490
Manjodi is not your Wife's
name know?

970
01:02:30,698 --> 01:02:31,990
Then, why didn't you change it?

971
01:02:32,032 --> 01:02:34,657
You dislike it when you are called
'Kanthi Sajith Kumar'.

972
01:02:34,781 --> 01:02:36,157
This is what I understand.

973
01:02:36,365 --> 01:02:37,407
Is it not true?

974
01:02:37,449 --> 01:02:38,616
Absolutely False!

975
01:02:38,948 --> 01:02:41,490
'She dislikes it when she is
called Kanthi Sajith Kumar'

976
01:02:41,532 --> 01:02:42,574
is not true.

977
01:02:42,616 --> 01:02:43,616
Right?

978
01:02:46,657 --> 01:02:50,240
This says that you've been
an irresponsible wife.

979
01:02:50,449 --> 01:02:52,657
Also have not understood the
likes of the petitioner.

980
01:02:53,532 --> 01:02:55,282
- Is it true?
- No.

981
01:02:55,698 --> 01:02:57,240
That is not true

982
01:02:58,574 --> 01:03:01,907
For my client, who had a lot of
fantasies about his marital life,

983
01:03:01,990 --> 01:03:03,407
as a wife,

984
01:03:03,490 --> 01:03:05,698
you could deliver him only
disappointment, I say

985
01:03:06,365 --> 01:03:07,657
Is it true?

986
01:03:08,574 --> 01:03:10,574
- Is it not true?
- No.

987
01:03:11,032 --> 01:03:12,282
Not true!

988
01:03:13,616 --> 01:03:15,365
The sexual life you
people shared,

989
01:03:15,407 --> 01:03:17,449
is a total failure and,

990
01:03:17,616 --> 01:03:20,240
you were avoiding
the petitioner, it says.

991
01:03:25,157 --> 01:03:26,532
Didn't you hear me?

992
01:03:27,948 --> 01:03:29,532
Simply tell that it is true.

993
01:03:31,532 --> 01:03:34,157
Sir, the advocate is
trying to insult her.

994
01:03:35,365 --> 01:03:37,073
Is this a venue to
vomit your Bullshit?

995
01:03:38,948 --> 01:03:40,157
Why do you hit the roof?

996
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:42,199
Only those written in THIS
is been asked.

997
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:44,365
Sex Refusal is a strong ground.

998
01:03:44,532 --> 01:03:46,032
Sit R.P.

999
01:03:46,114 --> 01:03:48,383
I am trying to prove my ground,
Your Honor!

1000
01:03:48,407 --> 01:03:49,781
What are you trying to prove?

1001
01:03:49,823 --> 01:03:51,324
Did you peep into their
bedroom anytime?

1002
01:03:51,365 --> 01:03:53,823
Till now, Is it by peeping into
bedrooms you won cases?

1003
01:03:53,865 --> 01:03:55,574
- You....
- Sit R.P.

1004
01:03:57,407 --> 01:03:58,365
I say that,

1005
01:03:58,449 --> 01:04:00,948
You don't love the
petitioner sincerely,

1006
01:04:01,240 --> 01:04:03,324
You're deliberately avoiding him,

1007
01:04:03,532 --> 01:04:08,365
and you're deliberately denying
his right of sex in marriage

1008
01:04:15,657 --> 01:04:17,199
Please don't stand silent

1009
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:18,449
Speak on.

1010
01:04:19,073 --> 01:04:20,781
Do you wanna repeat
the question?

1011
01:04:23,698 --> 01:04:25,157
Not true.

1012
01:04:26,157 --> 01:04:27,532
I LOVE him.

1013
01:04:30,698 --> 01:04:35,490
You're not capable of providing
a happy marital  life to the petitioner.

1014
01:04:35,781 --> 01:04:37,199
Is it true?

1015
01:04:37,449 --> 01:04:39,616
The reason why you don't
agree to this divorce,

1016
01:04:39,698 --> 01:04:42,449
is just to deliberately harm
the petitioner, Sajith Kumar.

1017
01:04:42,490 --> 01:04:44,449
and also due to the
pressure from outside.

1018
01:04:44,698 --> 01:04:46,032
Is it not true?

1019
01:04:48,823 --> 01:04:50,282
Have you loved anyone?

1020
01:04:50,657 --> 01:04:52,324
Sir, what nonsense is he asking?

1021
01:04:52,365 --> 01:04:54,907
Like questioning college students?

1022
01:05:00,657 --> 01:05:02,199
Have you loved anyone?

1023
01:05:02,823 --> 01:05:04,948
I'm asking you that did you
love anyone before marriage?

1024
01:05:07,990 --> 01:05:09,365
Yes, I've

1025
01:05:10,407 --> 01:05:12,574
Yes? Then, how many people?

1026
01:05:12,823 --> 01:05:14,956
This is non sense, sir!
- Wait!

1027
01:05:15,032 --> 01:05:16,324
How many people?

1028
01:05:17,948 --> 01:05:19,199
Can't count it?

1029
01:05:21,407 --> 01:05:22,948
Is it that you don't
remember the number?

1030
01:05:24,865 --> 01:05:26,698
I say that you've had
many love affairs,

1031
01:05:26,781 --> 01:05:28,948
and you don't feel even a
fraction of love for the petitioner,

1032
01:05:29,032 --> 01:05:33,365
And by this marriage, you were destroying
the dreams and life of the petitioner.

1033
01:05:33,823 --> 01:05:35,324
Is it not true?

1034
01:05:41,818 --> 01:05:42,818
Finished?

1035
01:05:42,843 --> 01:05:44,995
Yes, Your Honor!
Thank you!

1036
01:05:45,616 --> 01:05:46,990
You can go.

1037
01:05:50,802 --> 01:05:52,442
R.P.!
- Yes!

1038
01:05:54,574 --> 01:05:56,781
Why are all they here?

1039
01:05:56,865 --> 01:05:58,948
A tug of war is going on

1040
01:05:59,032 --> 01:06:00,073
For what?

1041
01:06:00,324 --> 01:06:02,490
Between a furious couple.

1042
01:06:02,532 --> 01:06:04,740
- Who won?
- No idea.

1043
01:06:07,115 --> 01:06:08,865
Not your cup of tea

1044
01:06:08,907 --> 01:06:10,395
Fishy BATHROOM scenes!!

1045
01:06:10,449 --> 01:06:12,073
This is a COURT bro,

1046
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:13,948
Why did you get married?

1047
01:06:14,532 --> 01:06:17,324
I'm asking you WHY did
you get married?

1048
01:06:18,282 --> 01:06:19,907
Why you are looking
here and there?

1049
01:06:19,990 --> 01:06:21,449
Don't you understand Malayalam?

1050
01:06:21,490 --> 01:06:23,823
I'll repeat, ' WHY
did you get Married?

1051
01:06:25,199 --> 01:06:27,490
He doesn't know why
he has married?

1052
01:06:27,698 --> 01:06:29,532
You give him Some Time to speak.

1053
01:06:29,948 --> 01:06:30,948
Alright.

1054
01:06:31,365 --> 01:06:34,698
Was this alliance
with your consent?

1055
01:06:34,990 --> 01:06:36,365
Is it not right?

1056
01:06:37,365 --> 01:06:40,407
It was my family who
decided first. Later,

1057
01:06:40,449 --> 01:06:42,365
You don't have
to narrate a STORY.

1058
01:06:42,532 --> 01:06:45,282
Answer TO the
Question! OK?

1059
01:06:46,532 --> 01:06:49,657
This marriage had
your consent, right?

1060
01:06:49,865 --> 01:06:50,865
Yes

1061
01:06:50,948 --> 01:06:53,657
This marriage had my Consent.

1062
01:06:54,365 --> 01:06:55,657
After marriage,

1063
01:06:55,698 --> 01:06:58,990
You've lived together
only for a week

1064
01:06:59,032 --> 01:07:01,282
- Is it not true?
- Yes.

1065
01:07:01,823 --> 01:07:03,324
It is within This one week,

1066
01:07:03,407 --> 01:07:07,032
you understood that you did not
get Sex from your wife. Right?

1067
01:07:08,574 --> 01:07:10,324
Look here and Speak.

1068
01:07:10,948 --> 01:07:12,157
Reply him.

1069
01:07:12,407 --> 01:07:14,240
Is the advocate right about
what he asked.

1070
01:07:14,823 --> 01:07:15,740
Yes.

1071
01:07:16,948 --> 01:07:18,865
What kind of responsibilities,

1072
01:07:18,907 --> 01:07:21,823
did the respondent fail to do as a wife?
Can you tell?

1073
01:07:21,865 --> 01:07:22,990
Can you tell?

1074
01:07:23,282 --> 01:07:25,698
- That's it, You CANNOT!
- That how can I?

1075
01:07:25,781 --> 01:07:26,990
Reply to my Question.

1076
01:07:27,327 --> 01:07:29,804
Yes or No?
- No.

1077
01:07:29,909 --> 01:07:30,909
No?

1078
01:07:33,449 --> 01:07:35,490
When was this taken?

1079
01:07:37,823 --> 01:07:40,073
- On the day of wedding
- Was it marked?

1080
01:07:40,204 --> 01:07:43,966
Exhibit Two. Already marked, Your Honor!
- Yes, yes, yes.

1081
01:07:43,990 --> 01:07:45,823
I say that, during the initial
days of marriage,

1082
01:07:45,865 --> 01:07:49,781
You and the respondent shared
Love and Happiness.

1083
01:07:49,907 --> 01:07:54,698
And, some external advices forced
you take THIS decision of Divorce

1084
01:07:55,990 --> 01:07:57,157
No

1085
01:07:57,282 --> 01:07:58,324
NO?

1086
01:07:58,616 --> 01:08:01,324
But, You HAVE Love for
the repondent right?

1087
01:08:04,282 --> 01:08:05,282
No

1088
01:08:06,532 --> 01:08:08,532
Infact, your Inside is full of love,

1089
01:08:08,698 --> 01:08:12,365
You can never insult a person like
the respondent in the society

1090
01:08:12,574 --> 01:08:15,157
Having a MOTHER and
a SISTER at home,

1091
01:08:15,240 --> 01:08:18,532
You can't harm an innocent
woman like the respondent

1092
01:08:18,616 --> 01:08:21,490
The allegations should be FAKE and...

1093
01:08:21,532 --> 01:08:23,781
- Your Honour, he is trying to
emotionally blackmail my client

1094
01:08:23,823 --> 01:08:25,698
** I want 'DIVORCE' **

1095
01:08:26,324 --> 01:08:28,490
I HATE Her.

1096
01:08:35,032 --> 01:08:37,490
Whatever said here is
NOT the Real TRUTH.

1097
01:08:37,990 --> 01:08:39,616
Is This your Advocate's Brain Child?

1098
01:08:39,781 --> 01:08:42,449
Tell the truth.

1099
01:08:42,490 --> 01:08:43,698
You proceed

1100
01:08:44,948 --> 01:08:46,907
What he said are not the reasons.

1101
01:08:47,365 --> 01:08:48,948
My problems are different.

1102
01:08:49,990 --> 01:08:51,616
I don't want her.

1103
01:08:53,823 --> 01:08:56,407
I want Divorce. I don't
know anything more.

1104
01:08:57,586 --> 01:08:58,653
See, Your Honor!

1105
01:08:58,907 --> 01:09:00,990
These were just FAKE grounds

1106
01:09:01,032 --> 01:09:02,781
Advocate Pradeepan Manjodi,

1107
01:09:02,865 --> 01:09:05,032
created to pocket fees
and to win the case,

1108
01:09:05,865 --> 01:09:07,740
My client is emotionally disturbed.

1109
01:09:07,781 --> 01:09:09,698
What the hell are you cooking up?

1110
01:09:10,115 --> 01:09:12,199
I'm here not to get
them separated.

1111
01:09:12,282 --> 01:09:13,532
Did you ever think so?

1112
01:09:13,990 --> 01:09:15,574
Show Some decency
in conducting the case.

1113
01:09:15,616 --> 01:09:17,781
Do you think that you can
do any GIMMICKS here?

1114
01:09:18,449 --> 01:09:20,282
Infact, I should file a
case against YOU.

1115
01:09:20,990 --> 01:09:23,115
You only tried to insult that girl.

1116
01:09:24,365 --> 01:09:26,407
Why do you fill your
pocket being so brutal?

1117
01:09:29,574 --> 01:09:32,407
Don't ever come to the court
with such STRATAGEMS.

1118
01:09:43,532 --> 01:09:47,657
Your experience is not even half
life of mine, dear Pradeepan

1119
01:09:47,948 --> 01:09:50,490
I've always been a
BLOODY Player!

1120
01:09:51,532 --> 01:09:52,865
Understood?

1121
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:10,365
Advocate,

1122
01:10:11,990 --> 01:10:13,657
I couldn't stand it.

1123
01:10:13,781 --> 01:10:15,073
Shut Up you!

1124
01:10:15,698 --> 01:10:17,282
I should NEVER see you here.

1125
01:10:17,948 --> 01:10:20,324
You are a FOOL,
a real BUFFOON

1126
01:10:22,032 --> 01:10:23,823
Can't you die,
you Muttonhead?

1127
01:10:25,199 --> 01:10:26,781
Couldn't stand it seems.

1128
01:10:27,365 --> 01:10:29,490
Are you happy for
humiliating me?

1129
01:10:30,073 --> 01:10:31,907
Why the heck did you
get married also?

1130
01:10:31,948 --> 01:10:34,282
You'll NEVER ever get
Divorce in your life

1131
01:10:35,781 --> 01:10:37,781
If I speak further, You'll
see your PYRE in me

1132
01:10:37,823 --> 01:10:39,781
If you stay here anymore,
I might beat you.

1133
01:10:40,574 --> 01:10:42,157
All is over by today.

1134
01:10:42,948 --> 01:10:45,073
What the Unhappy Lot made me
take up your case?

1135
01:10:45,657 --> 01:10:47,365
You are a Bloody BOLT
inside my neck.

1136
01:10:47,407 --> 01:10:48,574
Get Lost!

1137
01:11:06,574 --> 01:11:08,032
Yes Kanakan bro,

1138
01:11:09,449 --> 01:11:11,240
You tell me the matter.
What is the problem?

1139
01:11:12,282 --> 01:11:14,574
- OK, I'll come
- Pradeep bro, tell me the matter

1140
01:11:14,781 --> 01:11:16,532
NOTHING!
Pradeepan FAILED!

1141
01:12:26,823 --> 01:12:28,407
What is FAIR in this?

1142
01:12:28,490 --> 01:12:31,574
Am I just for screaming slogans,
stick postures and whipping?

1143
01:12:31,616 --> 01:12:33,740
At last, if you were to give
seat to some Alien,

1144
01:12:33,781 --> 01:12:35,823
Why the hell did people like
me die for the Party?

1145
01:12:35,865 --> 01:12:36,948
Pradeepan, please stop.

1146
01:12:37,032 --> 01:12:38,115
What?

1147
01:12:39,032 --> 01:12:40,282
My dear Pradeepan,

1148
01:12:40,324 --> 01:12:43,073
Elections can't be won
with just your LLB.

1149
01:12:43,115 --> 01:12:45,490
Infact, who knows you here?

1150
01:12:45,657 --> 01:12:47,324
What Fame do you
have here?

1151
01:12:47,365 --> 01:12:48,199
Leave it!

1152
01:12:48,240 --> 01:12:51,032
Atleast can you sight a single
CASE that you've won?

1153
01:12:51,073 --> 01:12:52,781
That someone knows?

1154
01:12:52,823 --> 01:12:54,490
Then what?

1155
01:12:54,740 --> 01:12:56,199
You may leave now.

1156
01:12:59,823 --> 01:13:01,199
So, you're avoiding me.

1157
01:13:01,240 --> 01:13:04,657
Alright! You may give
seat to anyone you like.

1158
01:13:04,698 --> 01:13:06,365
But, I'll be here around.

1159
01:13:06,948 --> 01:13:09,282
First Priority to Pradeepan
is the PARTY Itself.

1160
01:13:09,574 --> 01:13:11,073
Hey, don't get upset.
You come.

1161
01:13:11,865 --> 01:13:13,115
To say What?

1162
01:13:13,157 --> 01:13:15,449
Pradeepan has no Fame. So,
Pradeepan shouldn't contest

1163
01:13:15,490 --> 01:13:18,616
Is it not? Let it
be, No problem.

1164
01:13:18,657 --> 01:13:20,698
- You be seated. Sit! Sit!
- Don't loose your temper.

1165
01:13:20,698 --> 01:13:22,365
I'm leaving!
I'm leaving!

1166
01:13:42,115 --> 01:13:43,823
I'm going to DIE.

1167
01:13:45,365 --> 01:13:48,990
I'll be no more by the time
you finish watching this video.

1168
01:13:49,781 --> 01:13:52,365
My life is feckingly ruined.

1169
01:13:52,698 --> 01:13:55,698
All of them together, spoiled
the life of a young man

1170
01:13:57,073 --> 01:13:59,449
I will never have a GOOD wife.

1171
01:14:00,199 --> 01:14:01,823
The people who are responsible
for my death are

1172
01:14:01,865 --> 01:14:07,449
my family and Advocate Pradeepan Manjodi.

1173
01:14:15,522 --> 01:14:17,772
Now a days,
Baldness is a fashion.

1174
01:14:17,814 --> 01:14:20,355
But, you're not much Bald.
Are you?

1175
01:14:20,439 --> 01:14:22,898
No, I don't have. I
was saying 'In General'

1176
01:14:23,147 --> 01:14:27,105
Some bald ones are doing
hair fixing and all.

1177
01:14:27,147 --> 01:14:30,189
That is so boring.
Your beauty lies in this.

1178
01:14:31,856 --> 01:14:34,481
In truth, how old are you?

1179
01:14:35,272 --> 01:14:37,564
By the month of 'Kumbham',
he will be 39.

1180
01:14:38,022 --> 01:14:39,939
Why aren't you having tea?
Please have it.

1181
01:14:40,439 --> 01:14:41,606
Have it

1182
01:14:42,272 --> 01:14:43,898
What are you by profession?

1183
01:14:44,022 --> 01:14:45,814
- I'm an Advoc...
- Don't you know him?

1184
01:14:45,856 --> 01:14:47,647
He's a Busy going advocate.

1185
01:14:47,814 --> 01:14:50,647
He has a plenty of
cases at High Court.

1186
01:14:59,230 --> 01:15:00,647
Yes Shamsu,

1187
01:15:01,772 --> 01:15:03,147
What?

1188
01:15:04,543 --> 01:15:05,543
One moment.

1189
01:15:06,355 --> 01:15:07,772
Lemme..Out Please?

1190
01:15:08,189 --> 01:15:10,856
Didn't you see it?
He is always busy.

1191
01:15:11,939 --> 01:15:13,272
Yeah! tell me, what is it?

1192
01:15:13,314 --> 01:15:15,856
Pradeep bro, you should come here
at the earliest. There is a problem

1193
01:15:15,939 --> 01:15:17,189
You tell me the matter!

1194
01:15:19,564 --> 01:15:20,731
What?

1195
01:15:25,439 --> 01:15:27,189
- What is it?
- You come, I'll tell you.

1196
01:15:27,731 --> 01:15:28,731
You come.

1197
01:15:36,439 --> 01:15:37,939
You watch this.

1198
01:15:38,782 --> 01:15:39,782
What is it?

1199
01:15:40,272 --> 01:15:43,439
* By the time you finish watching
this video, I'll be no more *

1200
01:15:44,251 --> 01:15:46,803
The responsible people
for my death are my family and

1201
01:15:47,324 --> 01:15:49,563
Advocate Pradeepan Majodi!

1202
01:15:52,314 --> 01:15:53,939
What shall we do
with him, advocate?

1203
01:15:53,980 --> 01:15:56,189
Don't beat him.
Move, move, move.

1204
01:15:56,230 --> 01:15:57,898
Are you blackmailing me?

1205
01:15:57,939 --> 01:15:59,272
Whom do you think you're?

1206
01:15:59,314 --> 01:16:00,939
Can't you die instead?

1207
01:16:01,481 --> 01:16:03,606
- How do you think you can harm me?
- No advocate, No.

1208
01:16:03,731 --> 01:16:05,063
People would see,
People would see.

1209
01:16:05,105 --> 01:16:06,522
Let them see This.

1210
01:16:06,564 --> 01:16:07,814
Is he trying to threaten me?

1211
01:16:07,856 --> 01:16:10,147
This is an extra dose of what
received from court

1212
01:16:12,856 --> 01:16:15,147
- Chill Pradeep bro
- Please! No!

1213
01:16:15,689 --> 01:16:17,063
It was not fair to beat him up

1214
01:16:17,147 --> 01:16:18,606
Gosh! I'll Kiss him instead.

1215
01:16:18,647 --> 01:16:20,814
May be his situation
forced him to do so.

1216
01:16:20,856 --> 01:16:23,063
Don't we know that he
is a Brainless Bimbo?

1217
01:16:26,189 --> 01:16:28,189
Got escaped only since
Mukesh followed him

1218
01:16:28,230 --> 01:16:29,939
He is a Wisecrack!

1219
01:16:44,241 --> 01:16:47,616
* By the time you finish watching
this video, I'll be no more *

1220
01:16:59,230 --> 01:17:00,689
Pradeep bro, Let's have a drink.

1221
01:17:00,772 --> 01:17:03,689
- I've an important call to make.
- Hey, Don't scoot bro!

1222
01:17:03,852 --> 01:17:05,986
Okay, okay. Important call, huh?

1223
01:17:06,814 --> 01:17:08,230
Advocate,

1224
01:17:08,695 --> 01:17:09,695
Sorry.

1225
01:17:12,147 --> 01:17:15,105
It's not to Belittle you, I did it.

1226
01:17:16,731 --> 01:17:18,522
I was not courageous enough to die.

1227
01:17:19,606 --> 01:17:21,439
So, at that moment,
I felt like doing so.

1228
01:17:21,522 --> 01:17:22,564
That is the thing.

1229
01:17:22,606 --> 01:17:24,439
It would've been a Menace
if Mukesh hadn't come.

1230
01:17:24,481 --> 01:17:26,397
We all would've hung.
It is Section 306.

1231
01:17:26,898 --> 01:17:28,022
Is it getting into your brain?

1232
01:17:28,063 --> 01:17:29,314
This is not a Kid stuff.

1233
01:17:29,439 --> 01:17:31,481
I wouldn't have died even
if Mukesh didn't come.

1234
01:17:33,522 --> 01:17:34,856
Since my school days,

1235
01:17:34,904 --> 01:17:36,397
I've always been a Joker.

1236
01:17:37,314 --> 01:17:40,522
I don't have the Guts
to even look at a girl

1237
01:17:40,898 --> 01:17:42,647
My family taught me so.

1238
01:17:43,272 --> 01:17:46,063
Being always held in check,
I became THIS.

1239
01:17:46,814 --> 01:17:48,314
Even my marriage.

1240
01:17:49,898 --> 01:17:51,731
I definitely wanted a partner.

1241
01:17:52,564 --> 01:17:54,898
But, I should be able to
love her, right?

1242
01:17:56,355 --> 01:17:58,983
Though a Joker, don't I also
have dreams and likes?

1243
01:18:01,689 --> 01:18:04,647
Leave it. Shame if
they come seeing this.

1244
01:18:04,814 --> 01:18:07,856
Oh, Your beating him in the
public is not shameful ?

1245
01:18:07,939 --> 01:18:09,147
You go off.

1246
01:18:09,481 --> 01:18:10,772
Don't take it serious.

1247
01:18:10,814 --> 01:18:12,272
Did it hurt you?

1248
01:18:14,105 --> 01:18:15,647
Leave it, That's OK.

1249
01:18:16,147 --> 01:18:17,814
You carry on.
Go man

1250
01:18:18,808 --> 01:18:20,604
Leave it. Go!

1251
01:18:24,689 --> 01:18:26,272
He is a poor guy as well.

1252
01:18:28,105 --> 01:18:29,564
So, what's the plan?

1253
01:18:30,022 --> 01:18:31,189
What Plan?

1254
01:18:31,230 --> 01:18:32,481
Let's drink?

1255
01:18:32,522 --> 01:18:34,022
I'm asking the plans for HIM.

1256
01:18:34,731 --> 01:18:36,063
Let him also join us.

1257
01:18:40,564 --> 01:18:42,481
Ammini, hold it.

1258
01:18:42,522 --> 01:18:45,522
- I don't want. I don't drink.
- Cummon, hold it man

1259
01:18:45,606 --> 01:18:48,230
Let's ENJOY.
Have it buddy.

1260
01:18:49,689 --> 01:18:50,939
Drink it.

1261
01:18:51,980 --> 01:18:53,647
Didn't you see him drinking?

1262
01:18:53,689 --> 01:18:55,439
Likewise, you also have a gulp.

1263
01:18:55,481 --> 01:18:56,814
For all of you to know,

1264
01:18:56,898 --> 01:18:59,022
I'm going to say something
very serious.

1265
01:19:00,564 --> 01:19:02,731
We're going to Retry your case.

1266
01:19:03,731 --> 01:19:05,439
We're going to Catch it up.

1267
01:19:05,898 --> 01:19:08,113
Going to 'SEPARATE',
make it clear bro

1268
01:19:08,689 --> 01:19:10,189
Happy?

1269
01:19:12,022 --> 01:19:15,105
Pradeep bro, THAT old song
of your's, Please sing know?

1270
01:19:15,731 --> 01:19:19,355
Is it not for our Ammini? Sing Advocate
Sing! Sing! We'll pat the rhythm

1271
01:19:19,606 --> 01:19:22,314
If it is for Ammini, OK!

1272
01:19:25,856 --> 01:19:33,481
$ Oh my Charming beauty $

1273
01:19:34,564 --> 01:19:39,439
$ Oh my charming beauty, I knit
a nest of Love in my heart $

1274
01:19:39,522 --> 01:19:43,856
$ Oh my charming beauty, I knit
a nest of Love in my heart $

1275
01:19:43,898 --> 01:19:48,522
$ When you dawned after a long wait,
the nest flew off with the cheeky wind $

1276
01:19:48,564 --> 01:19:53,564
$ When you dawned after a long wait,
the nest flew off with the cheeky wind $

1277
01:19:57,397 --> 01:20:02,314
$ Will flowers bloom on the stems
scored by thorns $

1278
01:20:02,355 --> 01:20:07,105
$ Will flowers bloom on the stems
scored by thorns $

1279
01:20:07,189 --> 01:20:11,731
$ Will Love bloom in the heart,
Of an angry she-bird $

1280
01:20:11,856 --> 01:20:20,814
$ Will Love bloom in the heart,
Of an angry she-bird $

1281
01:20:23,314 --> 01:20:28,105
$ To douse the thorn Off the eyes,
And strip the Love Off the heart $

1282
01:20:28,147 --> 01:20:32,731
$ To douse the thorn Off the eyes,
And strip the Love Off the heart $

1283
01:20:32,814 --> 01:20:39,772
$ The mindless wait, to turn tragic,
When a mug's game is on $

1284
01:20:39,856 --> 01:20:47,230
$ The mindless wait, to turn tragic,
When a mug's game is on $

1285
01:20:47,606 --> 01:20:48,814
I'll be outside

1286
01:20:51,564 --> 01:20:55,980
$ When She is a puzzle in herself $

1287
01:20:56,105 --> 01:21:00,647
$ When She is a puzzle in herself $

1288
01:21:00,731 --> 01:21:05,147
$ Digging deep into her,
His life beats to the rhythm of Booze $

1289
01:21:05,230 --> 01:21:10,689
$ Digging deep into her,
His life beats to the rhythm of Booze $

1290
01:21:14,134 --> 01:21:15,801
It's our friend, Pradeep.

1291
01:21:19,272 --> 01:21:20,564
Yes, tell me Pradeepa,

1292
01:21:20,647 --> 01:21:21,939
Kanakan bro,

1293
01:21:22,105 --> 01:21:26,063
Only Pradeepan Manjodi's face
would smile on the walls here.

1294
01:21:26,189 --> 01:21:28,939
I'll never allow an outlander
to play politics HERE.

1295
01:21:29,022 --> 01:21:30,522
Otherwise, why are we here?

1296
01:21:30,856 --> 01:21:33,022
Pradeepan is gonna play a Game now.

1297
01:21:33,063 --> 01:21:36,314
Even I know ways to become famous.

1298
01:21:45,439 --> 01:21:46,814
Hey, Shamsu,

1299
01:21:47,355 --> 01:21:49,022
In the case of Amminipilla,

1300
01:21:49,063 --> 01:21:52,189
there is a Sensational Loop hiding behind,
that any of us didn't notice

1301
01:21:54,063 --> 01:21:56,439
We're going to Shake it out.

1302
01:22:12,980 --> 01:22:14,564
So, You want Divorce?

1303
01:22:14,939 --> 01:22:18,022
Definitely Sir, I can't
live with this Demoness

1304
01:22:18,105 --> 01:22:19,772
Even I can't.

1305
01:22:21,105 --> 01:22:23,898
Sir, he is a STONE in himself,
A Huge ROCK.

1306
01:22:23,939 --> 01:22:25,522
You shouldn't Utter a word either.

1307
01:22:25,564 --> 01:22:28,314
My mother had warned me
not to marry you.

1308
01:22:28,355 --> 01:22:29,647
but I disobeyed.

1309
01:22:29,689 --> 01:22:31,481
For what I'm suffering now.

1310
01:22:31,522 --> 01:22:34,439
Do you think Hemamalini
would marry you, OLDSTER?

1311
01:22:34,481 --> 01:22:35,856
You stop blabbering.

1312
01:22:35,939 --> 01:22:37,898
Sir, his mommy right?

1313
01:22:37,939 --> 01:22:40,439
She was a Vampire,
a real life VAMPIRE.

1314
01:22:40,522 --> 01:22:42,980
She persistently bullied me a lot.

1315
01:22:43,022 --> 01:22:45,147
I'm the Lottery that you've
got, you Dumbo.

1316
01:22:45,189 --> 01:22:46,939
Yes! Yes!
A TORN Lottery

1317
01:22:46,980 --> 01:22:52,105
You can't find a single person in
Thalassery, who is more handsome than me.

1318
01:22:52,189 --> 01:22:54,355
Don't worry. We'll solve it out.

1319
01:22:54,439 --> 01:22:55,731
Sir, Nothing is there to SOLVE.

1320
01:22:55,772 --> 01:22:58,898
- I can't Live with her.
- Me too.

1321
01:22:58,939 --> 01:23:00,355
I want Divorce.

1322
01:23:00,439 --> 01:23:02,439
Sir, It's for him to remarry.

1323
01:23:02,522 --> 01:23:04,397
Yes Sweets. You are RIGHT for
the first time in your life.

1324
01:23:04,481 --> 01:23:06,105
Sir, didn't you hear his plan?

1325
01:23:06,189 --> 01:23:08,898
- Wicked Devil.
- Wicked Devil is your Dumb father.

1326
01:23:08,939 --> 01:23:11,189
- One Minute, One Minute, ONE MINUTE.
- How dare you call my father, Names?

1327
01:23:11,856 --> 01:23:13,230
How long have you been married?

1328
01:23:13,898 --> 01:23:15,439
'60'

1329
01:23:15,522 --> 01:23:17,022
It is '61', sir.

1330
01:23:17,105 --> 01:23:18,856
He has Alzheimers.

1331
01:23:19,355 --> 01:23:22,105
- Alzheimers is your Daddy's.........
- Behave properly

1332
01:23:22,147 --> 01:23:24,522
- I'll not let go if you attack my Daddy.
- Stop It.

1333
01:23:26,522 --> 01:23:27,939
STOP!

1334
01:23:28,439 --> 01:23:30,481
61 Years till date?

1335
01:23:30,564 --> 01:23:33,772
Many others are striving here to
live ONE year together.

1336
01:23:33,814 --> 01:23:35,314
That is when you come
with 61 years' story

1337
01:23:35,355 --> 01:23:37,606
You people constitute
The Wonders of the world.

1338
01:23:38,272 --> 01:23:40,189
Don't you have Children
and Grand Children?

1339
01:23:40,856 --> 01:23:42,564
Now, why do you wanna
get separated?

1340
01:23:43,230 --> 01:23:45,063
Can't you live together happily?

1341
01:23:45,105 --> 01:23:47,355
Can you get me the Divorce?

1342
01:23:47,939 --> 01:23:50,522
Yes, I'll get you Divorce.
Do one thing.

1343
01:23:50,939 --> 01:23:53,105
Both of you watch a
film from Chitravani,

1344
01:23:53,147 --> 01:23:55,147
eat a Biriyani from Paris hotel

1345
01:23:55,522 --> 01:23:56,898
and come here.

1346
01:23:57,564 --> 01:23:59,481
Even after that,
if you feel the same,

1347
01:23:59,522 --> 01:24:01,189
I'll grant you, Steadfastly

1348
01:24:02,272 --> 01:24:04,063
OK? Then you go.

1349
01:24:04,105 --> 01:24:05,481
You come home.

1350
01:24:05,689 --> 01:24:07,522
- I'll Frenchify you.
- What Bullshit are you capable of doing?

1351
01:24:07,564 --> 01:24:09,641
- I'll throw poo at you.
- How funny, we'll see who's gonna win.

1352
01:24:09,689 --> 01:24:10,856
- Please go out.

1353
01:24:12,314 --> 01:24:14,522
Wait Man, I'm also coming.

1354
01:24:19,731 --> 01:24:21,470
Sir, I wanna tell something.

1355
01:24:21,522 --> 01:24:23,147
It's your misunderstanding.

1356
01:24:23,439 --> 01:24:25,522
Sir, you'll understand once I explain.

1357
01:24:25,564 --> 01:24:28,063
It was not a deliberate one.

1358
01:24:28,147 --> 01:24:29,856
You'll understand if I explain.

1359
01:24:31,772 --> 01:24:33,063
Sir, one...

1360
01:24:37,272 --> 01:24:39,189
This will not work out, Pradeep bro.

1361
01:24:41,731 --> 01:24:43,355
It WILL, Shamsu.

1362
01:24:53,898 --> 01:24:56,355
Sir, remember me? Hamsa?

1363
01:24:56,606 --> 01:24:58,063
Oh Hamsa? You alone?

1364
01:24:58,272 --> 01:25:00,564
Noop, both of them are with me.

1365
01:25:00,856 --> 01:25:02,314
How are things?

1366
01:25:03,814 --> 01:25:06,189
Giving 2000 each is
something very difficult

1367
01:25:06,272 --> 01:25:07,814
Court can say any crap.

1368
01:25:07,898 --> 01:25:10,147
So, I took both of them with me.

1369
01:25:10,856 --> 01:25:13,647
This is my first wife Amina, and
she is my second wife Aysha

1370
01:25:13,731 --> 01:25:16,481
- Greetings!
- Both of them are big fans of your's

1371
01:25:17,689 --> 01:25:19,939
- Have it? Don't want?
- Sit properly.

1372
01:25:20,898 --> 01:25:23,689
You watch it. I've
seen it twice before.

1373
01:25:24,439 --> 01:25:27,314
- Now, I've come for my wives.
- Let it be.

1374
01:25:28,147 --> 01:25:30,731
Tell me if you don't like it.
We'll skip it after interval

1375
01:25:32,397 --> 01:25:33,814
Get me 3.

1376
01:25:36,147 --> 01:25:37,856
One second, what is it?

1377
01:25:41,439 --> 01:25:42,647
You stay here.

1378
01:25:44,272 --> 01:25:46,439
Hey, he is coming.
Pretend some respect.

1379
01:25:51,606 --> 01:25:54,230
I'm rich enough to address my
kid's needs. Ok?

1380
01:25:54,314 --> 01:25:56,731
Why is this sir?
it's just for a pleasure.

1381
01:25:56,772 --> 01:25:58,063
I'm NOT taking up THAT case.

1382
01:25:58,147 --> 01:26:00,772
You don't have to waste up
your LOVE for that.

1383
01:26:01,272 --> 01:26:03,856
- Don't say that, sir?
- I'm not SAYING.

1384
01:26:05,230 --> 01:26:06,230
OK Then.

1385
01:26:11,647 --> 01:26:13,439
- A little mango juice ?
- You go man.

1386
01:26:20,105 --> 01:26:21,314
What the heck again?

1387
01:26:21,355 --> 01:26:23,355
Just one thing. I'm not forcing
you to take up That case.

1388
01:26:23,397 --> 01:26:25,606
But, please listen to me for a while.

1389
01:26:25,731 --> 01:26:28,439
- Kiddo, I'll get you chocolates tomorrow.
- You sit there

1390
01:26:29,063 --> 01:26:31,314
This is concerned with the
Life of a poor guy.

1391
01:26:31,355 --> 01:26:32,731
He is young.

1392
01:26:32,772 --> 01:26:34,022
And this is his life.

1393
01:26:34,105 --> 01:26:35,772
What if he does something
out of the box?

1394
01:26:35,814 --> 01:26:38,647
- Will he?
- Yes, I'm damn sure about it.

1395
01:26:39,105 --> 01:26:41,980
I'm the JUDGE of a Family Court

1396
01:26:42,439 --> 01:26:44,063
And not a School Headmaster.

1397
01:26:44,189 --> 01:26:45,898
You lift your hands from there.

1398
01:26:47,731 --> 01:26:49,898
I've just done what
others also do?

1399
01:26:49,939 --> 01:26:51,439
You know it very well also?

1400
01:26:51,481 --> 01:26:52,689
Then, why so adamant?

1401
01:26:52,814 --> 01:26:55,105
Sir, what you show right now is
the adamancy of a School Teacher.

1402
01:26:56,105 --> 01:26:58,063
Advocate, you lift your
hands and leave.

1403
01:26:59,939 --> 01:27:01,063
Go! Go!

1404
01:27:06,939 --> 01:27:08,772
Alas! What to do with this?

1405
01:27:08,814 --> 01:27:10,314
What if we meet him at his house?

1406
01:27:10,355 --> 01:27:11,898
Noop. It will not workout

1407
01:27:11,939 --> 01:27:14,731
Advocate, what if we move
to high court?

1408
01:27:14,939 --> 01:27:16,063
Fool!

1409
01:27:16,397 --> 01:27:18,439
Do you even know where
the High Court is?

1410
01:27:18,731 --> 01:27:20,272
Doesn't Advocate Shamsu know it?

1411
01:27:20,397 --> 01:27:21,689
You and your Shamsu advocate!

1412
01:27:21,814 --> 01:27:22,939
Get lost!

1413
01:27:23,731 --> 01:27:25,105
He doesn't know?

1414
01:27:25,189 --> 01:27:27,481
There are chances that
the matter gets settled.

1415
01:27:29,272 --> 01:27:30,439
Will it be over?

1416
01:27:30,522 --> 01:27:31,689
Does it have scope?

1417
01:27:32,063 --> 01:27:33,806
Doesn't it need one more Posting?

1418
01:27:38,606 --> 01:27:40,647
If it doesn't get solved
by one more Posting,

1419
01:27:40,814 --> 01:27:42,481
I'll move on with the case.

1420
01:27:52,189 --> 01:27:54,481
- MC 115/18
- Stop! Stop! Stop!

1421
01:27:54,772 --> 01:27:56,564
Take 160/18

1422
01:27:57,481 --> 01:28:00,063
OP 160/18

1423
01:28:00,230 --> 01:28:02,439
Petitioner Sajith Kumar Amminipilla,

1424
01:28:02,522 --> 01:28:04,898
Respondent Kanthi Shivadasan.

1425
01:28:12,594 --> 01:28:14,856
Next hearing: August 20th!

1426
01:28:16,453 --> 01:28:17,453
Thank you, sir!

1427
01:28:21,522 --> 01:28:23,105
God, Is it TRUE?

1428
01:28:24,397 --> 01:28:26,522
Otherwise also, they can't
Stop taking up your case.

1429
01:28:26,564 --> 01:28:27,898
They are court procedures for it

1430
01:28:28,147 --> 01:28:30,522
It's just that he
put us on the couch.

1431
01:28:30,606 --> 01:28:32,397
Your case has been taken up.

1432
01:28:32,481 --> 01:28:34,439
Oh Godspeed!

1433
01:28:34,814 --> 01:28:36,063
Hey,

1434
01:28:36,314 --> 01:28:38,022
People around are looking.

1435
01:28:38,522 --> 01:28:39,772
How crazy?

1436
01:28:43,564 --> 01:28:45,272
When we take up a case,

1437
01:28:45,606 --> 01:28:47,481
It is not enough to learn
our clients alone.

1438
01:28:47,856 --> 01:28:50,022
We should study the
Defendant Advocate as well.

1439
01:28:50,105 --> 01:28:51,772
That is the Success Formula.

1440
01:28:53,439 --> 01:28:55,147
R.P. knows it.

1441
01:28:55,522 --> 01:28:57,522
He is a Shepherd.

1442
01:29:01,397 --> 01:29:03,731
Cross Examination is an Art.

1443
01:29:03,939 --> 01:29:06,439
If you pass in it,
you win the Case.

1444
01:29:06,939 --> 01:29:10,189
It is after knowing the psychology
of those in the Box,

1445
01:29:10,230 --> 01:29:11,606
one should Cross.

1446
01:29:13,689 --> 01:29:15,856
Sir, Can you make
it a little simpler?

1447
01:29:16,147 --> 01:29:17,647
To make it simple,

1448
01:29:17,856 --> 01:29:19,314
During Prosecution,

1449
01:29:19,522 --> 01:29:22,230
Advocate should be like
a Theatre Artist.

1450
01:29:22,355 --> 01:29:23,898
Increasing your voice,

1451
01:29:23,939 --> 01:29:25,647
and by decreasing it,

1452
01:29:25,814 --> 01:29:27,147
Also by Staring,

1453
01:29:27,355 --> 01:29:28,481
Loving,

1454
01:29:28,564 --> 01:29:29,856
Scaring,

1455
01:29:30,689 --> 01:29:31,689
Patting,

1456
01:29:31,772 --> 01:29:33,689
and threatening them.

1457
01:29:35,592 --> 01:29:37,526
Life is but a walking shadow,

1458
01:29:37,754 --> 01:29:41,288
A play that stands and flex is
always upon the stage

1459
01:29:42,234 --> 01:29:46,100
There is to heard no more,
it is a tale told by an idiot!

1460
01:29:46,230 --> 01:29:48,063
Two more Large, please.

1461
01:29:49,890 --> 01:29:53,690
What is that drink he had?
Bring me that one to me here!

1462
01:29:55,254 --> 01:29:58,373
As you know, this is a fabricated
guess, Your Honor!

1463
01:29:58,397 --> 01:30:00,606
Wasting the Court's valuable time.

1464
01:30:00,856 --> 01:30:03,606
Those who doesn't even know
the grounds for Divorce,

1465
01:30:03,689 --> 01:30:05,814
have come wearing
an advocate's coat.

1466
01:30:06,114 --> 01:30:07,781
Kindly dismiss this case!

1467
01:30:07,814 --> 01:30:09,397
Sit R.P.,
We'll find a way out.

1468
01:30:09,481 --> 01:30:11,647
Does he have any lies
left to bring out?

1469
01:30:11,731 --> 01:30:12,814
Sit R.P.

1470
01:30:15,139 --> 01:30:16,872
Your Honor, may I?
- Yes!

1471
01:30:18,856 --> 01:30:20,147
One person,

1472
01:30:20,606 --> 01:30:21,856
an oldie indeed,

1473
01:30:22,274 --> 01:30:23,274
Everytime...

1474
01:30:23,481 --> 01:30:26,063
Everyday, he used to tie his goat

1475
01:30:26,105 --> 01:30:28,564
adjacent to a wall nearby for gracing.

1476
01:30:28,647 --> 01:30:30,522
What Rubbish is he talking?

1477
01:30:30,564 --> 01:30:31,980
Are you narrating a story?

1478
01:30:32,022 --> 01:30:33,731
It is something relevant.

1479
01:30:35,606 --> 01:30:38,063
One day, the entire wall fell on the goat

1480
01:30:38,105 --> 01:30:39,481
and it died.

1481
01:30:39,647 --> 01:30:42,522
The owner of the goat went straight
to the court and filed a case.

1482
01:30:42,647 --> 01:30:44,772
The Judge called up the Owner
of the wall and said that

1483
01:30:44,814 --> 01:30:46,105
You are the Culprit.

1484
01:30:46,147 --> 01:30:48,522
It's your wall that killed the goat.

1485
01:30:48,689 --> 01:30:51,063
He said that, the fault lies with

1486
01:30:51,105 --> 01:30:53,063
the one constructed the wall

1487
01:30:53,230 --> 01:30:54,647
The one who constructed
the wall said that

1488
01:30:54,689 --> 01:30:56,689
the fault is with the one
mixed the Cement

1489
01:30:56,772 --> 01:30:58,481
When the one mixed the
cement was questioned,

1490
01:30:58,522 --> 01:31:00,939
He said, It is not his
fault that the goat died

1491
01:31:01,063 --> 01:31:03,439
Later, do you know who
was held responsible?

1492
01:31:03,522 --> 01:31:06,355
The one who tied the
goat under the wall.

1493
01:31:06,481 --> 01:31:07,439
That is,

1494
01:31:07,481 --> 01:31:09,856
the petitioner himself
became the culprit.

1495
01:31:09,939 --> 01:31:12,939
Court ordered to Hang him.

1496
01:31:13,065 --> 01:31:15,206
Come to the point!
- Your Honor!

1497
01:31:15,230 --> 01:31:16,481
It's an old story.

1498
01:31:16,522 --> 01:31:19,063
But, my client is in
the same situation.

1499
01:31:19,272 --> 01:31:21,689
Here, 'Goat' is his 'Marriage'

1500
01:31:21,772 --> 01:31:23,731
The 'Goat Owner' is 'Him'.

1501
01:31:23,898 --> 01:31:26,189
Please don't give order
to Hang him.

1502
01:31:26,398 --> 01:31:30,940
Please come to the point!
- I want to cross examine PW-10 to PW15

1503
01:31:31,063 --> 01:31:33,731
While Cross examining new people,
am I not liable to know?

1504
01:31:33,772 --> 01:31:34,856
What the heck is this?

1505
01:31:34,898 --> 01:31:36,230
Cool down Advocate, Cool down.

1506
01:31:36,564 --> 01:31:39,063
You don't know the case.
It has just been filed.

1507
01:31:39,105 --> 01:31:40,355
Is it marked?

1508
01:31:40,758 --> 01:31:41,824
Yes, Your Honor!

1509
01:31:42,105 --> 01:31:43,439
Do you want all these?

1510
01:31:43,564 --> 01:31:45,022
They are relevant.

1511
01:31:53,063 --> 01:31:54,481
August 30,

1512
01:31:54,564 --> 01:31:57,814
This is just his Gimmicks
to earn Publicity.

1513
01:31:58,105 --> 01:32:01,022
Please don't sway
according to his tune.

1514
01:32:01,297 --> 01:32:02,165
R.P.!

1515
01:32:02,189 --> 01:32:04,022
Before me, you advocates
are irrelevant.

1516
01:32:04,063 --> 01:32:05,731
Only Petitions matter.

1517
01:32:05,814 --> 01:32:07,230
Court is not to create problems

1518
01:32:07,272 --> 01:32:08,772
but to solve them.

1519
01:32:08,814 --> 01:32:10,022
Did you understand?

1520
01:32:11,105 --> 01:32:14,230
Like last time, don't come up
with Stratagems this time

1521
01:32:14,439 --> 01:32:16,355
I can listen to Genuine Stuffs only.

1522
01:32:22,980 --> 01:32:24,522
- R.P. Sir,
- Ooh !!

1523
01:32:24,647 --> 01:32:26,731
Isn't it being a Single
player damn boring?

1524
01:32:26,814 --> 01:32:29,189
You Play as well.
We'll see.

1525
01:32:29,814 --> 01:32:31,272
Yes, I've my Masterplan
set ready for the Play.

1526
01:32:31,314 --> 01:32:33,355
Are you not older than
my experiences?

1527
01:32:33,439 --> 01:32:35,189
You give your best to
chase me up.

1528
01:32:42,687 --> 01:32:44,854
- Where are you?
- Bro, I'm here.

1529
01:32:46,604 --> 01:32:48,145
You just have to give
this cover there.

1530
01:32:48,187 --> 01:32:49,687
Remaining, I've discussed.

1531
01:32:49,729 --> 01:32:51,270
- You go
- OK, I'll call you.

1532
01:32:57,187 --> 01:32:58,854
Nothing.
I'll tell you later.

1533
01:33:30,729 --> 01:33:33,145
First time in the Judicial
history of Kerala,

1534
01:33:33,187 --> 01:33:35,229
we've an Odd case come up.

1535
01:33:35,312 --> 01:33:38,270
The system of arranged marriage
has been contested in the court by

1536
01:33:38,312 --> 01:33:41,521
Advocate Pradeepan Manjodi and
his client Shajith Kumar Amminipilla

1537
01:33:46,854 --> 01:33:48,437
The preparators of his marriage,

1538
01:33:48,521 --> 01:33:50,020
the Matrimony guy, the astrologer,

1539
01:33:50,062 --> 01:33:51,562
and own family

1540
01:33:51,604 --> 01:33:54,479
has been sent to Family Court, with the
help of Advocate Pradeepan Manjodi

1541
01:33:54,521 --> 01:33:56,854
by Shajith Kumar Amminipilla.

1542
01:34:03,978 --> 01:34:05,937
This has never happened in
this world before.

1543
01:34:06,020 --> 01:34:10,062
What the heck if you
all talk at a time?

1544
01:34:13,646 --> 01:34:17,479
- You can't park the car here.
- Then, you move it yourself

1545
01:34:17,521 --> 01:34:18,937
From where the hell has he come?

1546
01:34:18,978 --> 01:34:21,895
Move! Move! Move!
What is this?

1547
01:34:21,978 --> 01:34:25,104
I'm a famous Broker who has
conducted around 400 marriages.

1548
01:34:25,145 --> 01:34:26,813
Don't we have to
live peacefully?

1549
01:34:26,854 --> 01:34:29,229
- How unfair is this?
- First solve this

1550
01:34:49,646 --> 01:34:52,270
This Fight is not just for Ammini

1551
01:34:52,312 --> 01:34:57,687
It is for all the youth who suffers
from an Arranged Marital Alliance.

1552
01:34:57,771 --> 01:34:59,854
I represent their Voice.

1553
01:35:04,020 --> 01:35:05,604
I want JUSTICE.

1554
01:35:05,646 --> 01:35:07,437
I want DIVORCE.

1555
01:35:21,354 --> 01:35:23,354
Weren't you the one who checked the
Horoscope Matching of Shajith Kumar?

1556
01:35:23,437 --> 01:35:25,521
- Yes
- What was the match scale?

1557
01:35:25,687 --> 01:35:27,562
10/10 is the Match.

1558
01:35:28,437 --> 01:35:30,937
Then, why has he come
for the Divorce?

1559
01:35:31,687 --> 01:35:33,813
Which means you've checked
only the Matching part

1560
01:35:33,854 --> 01:35:35,521
and not the differences.

1561
01:35:35,562 --> 01:35:36,562
Right?

1562
01:35:37,813 --> 01:35:39,104
Your name?

1563
01:35:39,314 --> 01:35:42,180
Shanmugan! Heard me?
Mangalam Matrimonial!

1564
01:35:43,354 --> 01:35:44,604
How many marriages
have you conducted?

1565
01:35:44,687 --> 01:35:45,937
- Who?
- You.

1566
01:35:46,396 --> 01:35:47,895
What a funny question?

1567
01:35:47,978 --> 01:35:49,604
To such a famous broker,

1568
01:35:49,646 --> 01:35:51,187
if you ask the number
of marriages conducted

1569
01:35:51,229 --> 01:35:52,895
Numberless they are!

1570
01:35:52,978 --> 01:35:54,729
How many of them are
divorced now?

1571
01:35:54,813 --> 01:35:57,312
See, Marriage happens
at Heaven right?

1572
01:35:57,354 --> 01:35:59,978
- Aren't we just Mediators?
- His as well?

1573
01:36:00,020 --> 01:36:01,312
Yes, Of course!

1574
01:36:01,729 --> 01:36:04,604
How do you get the details of
marriages happening in the Heaven?

1575
01:36:04,687 --> 01:36:06,937
Do they call you or
send an email?

1576
01:36:09,437 --> 01:36:10,771
Before marriage,

1577
01:36:10,854 --> 01:36:14,312
Do you arrange a meeting for
the Bride and the Groom?

1578
01:36:14,354 --> 01:36:15,813
What is the need for that?

1579
01:36:15,854 --> 01:36:18,771
Because, they are going to
see for another lifetime.

1580
01:36:18,813 --> 01:36:21,062
So, why do they need
another venue for that?

1581
01:36:21,104 --> 01:36:22,604
So, before marriage,

1582
01:36:22,646 --> 01:36:26,604
you do not provide a venue for
the Bride and Groom to meet.

1583
01:36:32,020 --> 01:36:34,646
Did your son come to you
anytime saying that

1584
01:36:34,729 --> 01:36:36,229
he wants to marry?

1585
01:36:36,270 --> 01:36:37,229
No

1586
01:36:37,270 --> 01:36:39,270
Then why did you
get him married?

1587
01:36:39,312 --> 01:36:41,270
Because, we know that he
is at his marital age.

1588
01:36:41,312 --> 01:36:42,312
How come?

1589
01:36:42,354 --> 01:36:44,396
Did he pass any special signal,

1590
01:36:44,437 --> 01:36:46,604
informing you that he is
at his marital age?

1591
01:36:49,187 --> 01:36:50,895
Dear Mukesh Kumar,

1592
01:36:51,729 --> 01:36:54,104
Is you friend Handsome?

1593
01:36:56,437 --> 01:36:59,187
- Somewhat
- What about his wife?

1594
01:37:01,229 --> 01:37:02,854
Isn't she beautiful?

1595
01:37:05,062 --> 01:37:06,604
Is there nothing to complaint?

1596
01:37:08,187 --> 01:37:10,895
There is nothing to complaint about.
Yes or No?

1597
01:37:12,062 --> 01:37:13,396
She is Beautiful only.

1598
01:37:13,437 --> 01:37:15,771
Then, why is he getting a divorce?

1599
01:37:15,813 --> 01:37:17,937
Aren't they a perfect match?

1600
01:37:19,104 --> 01:37:21,396
Aren't they a real Match?

1601
01:37:21,854 --> 01:37:22,895
Yeah!

1602
01:37:23,270 --> 01:37:24,646
Now tell me,

1603
01:37:24,715 --> 01:37:27,813
Is there anything wrong
with his wife?

1604
01:37:27,854 --> 01:37:29,062
No

1605
01:37:29,437 --> 01:37:31,771
No?
Nothing?

1606
01:37:31,854 --> 01:37:35,062
If I say that there are no reasons
for them to get separated,

1607
01:37:35,521 --> 01:37:38,978
Mukesh Kumar will agree or deny?

1608
01:37:39,104 --> 01:37:40,437
What?

1609
01:37:40,521 --> 01:37:41,687
Will you agree?

1610
01:37:41,771 --> 01:37:43,437
You'll agree or deny?

1611
01:37:45,312 --> 01:37:47,145
- Will agree
- Will AGREE.

1612
01:37:47,437 --> 01:37:48,771
No, no...

1613
01:37:53,687 --> 01:37:55,354
Are you the one who
conducted this marriage?

1614
01:37:57,604 --> 01:37:59,229
That is going to get divorced.

1615
01:37:59,354 --> 01:38:00,813
Don't you know?

1616
01:38:04,020 --> 01:38:05,354
Tell something.

1617
01:38:06,125 --> 01:38:08,001
You know about this marriage,
then speak something!

1618
01:38:08,104 --> 01:38:10,104
Why you want to peep your
head into these things?

1619
01:38:10,187 --> 01:38:12,396
Many such marriages will
happen in our family

1620
01:38:12,437 --> 01:38:14,646
All of us have got
married like this only.

1621
01:38:14,729 --> 01:38:16,646
You better inquire
about it and come.

1622
01:38:16,854 --> 01:38:20,270
In Kerala, the rate
of Divorce is 700 %

1623
01:38:20,312 --> 01:38:21,604
It's high time we ponder over

1624
01:38:21,646 --> 01:38:24,562
the journey of a state
with 100% literacy.

1625
01:38:24,646 --> 01:38:26,854
Are you saying that the problem
lies in 'Arranged Marriage'?

1626
01:38:26,937 --> 01:38:29,229
Don't try to shoot in the
dark, dear Advocate

1627
01:38:29,270 --> 01:38:32,437
Did I tell that? Never!
I haven't!

1628
01:38:32,479 --> 01:38:34,895
If you are not allowing me
to talk what I have,

1629
01:38:34,937 --> 01:38:36,396
then find someone else to
bombard your blabbering.

1630
01:38:36,437 --> 01:38:39,604
- The remaining, I'll tell in Court.
- What is the use of saying that?

1631
01:38:39,646 --> 01:38:41,312
This is a democratic country.

1632
01:38:41,354 --> 01:38:42,687
Here, we've the right
to speak anything.

1633
01:38:42,729 --> 01:38:44,937
Don't say that.
You don't go like that.

1634
01:38:46,187 --> 01:38:47,978
Please don't go

1635
01:38:48,020 --> 01:38:50,145
Did you shoot me creating
a fuss over there?

1636
01:38:50,229 --> 01:38:51,396
Yes, I shot it.

1637
01:38:51,479 --> 01:38:52,854
Post it on Facebook.

1638
01:38:52,937 --> 01:38:54,604
Let it get VIRAL.

1639
01:38:55,895 --> 01:38:59,813
OOOhhh!!! To get VIRAL.
How Quick-witted?

1640
01:38:59,854 --> 01:39:02,396
* If I don't get to say what I want, *

1641
01:39:02,437 --> 01:39:04,104
* you find someone else to
bombard your blabbering *

1642
01:39:04,145 --> 01:39:06,312
* Remaining, I'll tell in Court *

1643
01:39:09,104 --> 01:39:12,312
I support Arranged Marriage.

1644
01:39:12,354 --> 01:39:15,562
What Pradeepan advocate
says is just his opinion.

1645
01:39:15,604 --> 01:39:18,521
Since you get support from family,
Arranged Marriage is better.

1646
01:39:18,604 --> 01:39:24,437
In Love Marriage, people can know
each other well before marriage.

1647
01:39:24,479 --> 01:39:27,396
So, in my opinion, that is good.

1648
01:39:27,521 --> 01:39:30,062
Love Marriage is a lottery
of 50-50 chance.

1649
01:39:31,978 --> 01:39:35,521
100% I support Arranged Marriage.

1650
01:39:35,562 --> 01:39:38,354
I support Arranged Marriage.

1651
01:39:38,437 --> 01:39:45,646
Lemme tell, Love cum
Arranged is more good.

1652
01:39:47,687 --> 01:39:50,771
She did a Love Marriage for which
she is suffering now.

1653
01:39:50,854 --> 01:39:52,437
Always, Love Marriage is good.

1654
01:39:52,479 --> 01:39:54,020
That will always be a failure.

1655
01:40:00,145 --> 01:40:02,978
Love or Arranged, Marriage
itself is suicidal

1656
01:40:03,062 --> 01:40:06,396
This is Love, this is Arranged.
I'm happy with both.

1657
01:40:17,813 --> 01:40:19,937
Marriage is a very common affair.

1658
01:40:19,978 --> 01:40:23,229
Let's find out what is the
reason behind his angst?

1659
01:40:23,312 --> 01:40:25,854
Arranged Married is the
only reason for Divorce.

1660
01:40:25,978 --> 01:40:27,687
I'll never say that.

1661
01:40:27,771 --> 01:40:29,354
But, if you analyze you
can see that,

1662
01:40:29,604 --> 01:40:33,646
Arranged Marriage is one of
the important reasons of marriage.

1663
01:40:35,187 --> 01:40:36,646
A flower is Blooming

1664
01:40:37,187 --> 01:40:39,145
It is with similar simplicity,

1665
01:40:39,187 --> 01:40:40,937
the youth gets married.

1666
01:40:41,145 --> 01:40:43,937
It looks as if it is to get divorced
that they are marrying.

1667
01:40:43,979 --> 01:40:45,437
Where would the world
end up like this?

1668
01:40:45,521 --> 01:40:46,687
Through this show,

1669
01:40:46,771 --> 01:40:49,229
we are coming, to know your
opinion about the topic

1670
01:40:52,521 --> 01:40:56,396
You chill. He is coming.
Let him come.

1671
01:40:56,437 --> 01:40:58,604
Come! Come!
Come!

1672
01:41:00,312 --> 01:41:02,354
Why all these have queued up?
What is the problem?

1673
01:41:02,437 --> 01:41:04,145
All of them want Divorce.

1674
01:41:04,187 --> 01:41:05,978
All Arranged Marriage teams.

1675
01:41:08,062 --> 01:41:09,521
At this age?

1676
01:41:22,729 --> 01:41:24,312
Have you loved anyone?

1677
01:41:25,145 --> 01:41:26,145
No.

1678
01:41:27,978 --> 01:41:29,437
Couldn't you love anytime?

1679
01:41:29,479 --> 01:41:30,604
It's fun.

1680
01:41:30,646 --> 01:41:32,729
Yours was a Love Marriage right?

1681
01:41:32,854 --> 01:41:33,646
Yes.

1682
01:41:33,895 --> 01:41:36,687
When I was in school, a girl
had gifted me a flower.

1683
01:41:37,437 --> 01:41:39,312
I gave it directly to my mom.

1684
01:41:39,687 --> 01:41:41,978
- Then?
- Then what?

1685
01:41:42,187 --> 01:41:44,479
Mom called her and
screwed her up.

1686
01:41:46,729 --> 01:41:48,062
Crazy!

1687
01:41:49,270 --> 01:41:51,229
How is your Dream girl?

1688
01:41:51,270 --> 01:41:52,479
Tell me.

1689
01:41:52,729 --> 01:41:54,020
That's a secret.

1690
01:41:54,479 --> 01:41:56,187
Cummon, tell me know?

1691
01:41:58,104 --> 01:41:59,854
Remember our old Actress,

1692
01:42:00,187 --> 01:42:01,687
Sumalatha!

1693
01:42:02,479 --> 01:42:04,604
My dream girl resembles her.

1694
01:42:05,771 --> 01:42:08,104
Sumalatha?
a-ha !

1695
01:42:09,187 --> 01:42:10,354
Dear advocate,

1696
01:42:10,687 --> 01:42:12,270
Lemme tell you one
dream of mine?

1697
01:42:12,687 --> 01:42:13,771
What is it?

1698
01:42:13,937 --> 01:42:15,813
I wanna rock life like you do.

1699
01:42:15,978 --> 01:42:17,521
with your friends and all

1700
01:42:19,145 --> 01:42:21,187
Are you asking me
to spoil you?

1701
01:42:22,604 --> 01:42:23,646
A little bit.

1702
01:42:28,062 --> 01:42:29,646
I've one more desire.

1703
01:42:29,729 --> 01:42:30,937
What is that?

1704
01:42:32,687 --> 01:42:34,771
I wanna do 'Something'
with Courage.

1705
01:42:35,978 --> 01:42:36,978
Means?

1706
01:42:37,729 --> 01:42:39,104
Anything with Courage.

1707
01:42:43,854 --> 01:42:45,854
You can help me out.

1708
01:42:49,978 --> 01:42:51,729
He is coming.
He is coming.

1709
01:42:51,771 --> 01:42:54,104
- Wear the helmet.
- Put it for him, Fast.

1710
01:42:54,187 --> 01:42:55,270
Go! Go!
Go!

1711
01:42:55,354 --> 01:42:56,312
Run! Run!

1712
01:42:57,396 --> 01:42:59,145
Bend! Bend!

1713
01:43:03,312 --> 01:43:04,521
Who is this?

1714
01:43:15,297 --> 01:43:16,564
What are you doing?

1715
01:43:26,521 --> 01:43:28,396
- Hey, How was it?
- How was it?

1716
01:43:28,437 --> 01:43:29,479
I beat him down.

1717
01:43:29,521 --> 01:43:31,187
- Now you are Man-like.
- Shall I give one more?

1718
01:43:31,229 --> 01:43:33,062
No, no,
You have time.

1719
01:43:33,145 --> 01:43:34,937
You have a lot more to do.

1720
01:43:39,354 --> 01:43:42,978
Get down. Now go inside and
blabber whatever you like

1721
01:43:43,229 --> 01:43:45,020
Advocate, Dad will beat
me for sure.

1722
01:43:45,145 --> 01:43:47,729
Let him do that. Isn't
he your father?

1723
01:43:48,687 --> 01:43:50,187
What should I tell him?

1724
01:43:50,270 --> 01:43:52,312
Should an advocate dictate
that as well?

1725
01:43:52,396 --> 01:43:54,479
At least now, get out of that
'Munchkin' impression

1726
01:43:54,771 --> 01:43:55,813
Did you hear me?

1727
01:43:57,771 --> 01:43:58,937
That's true.

1728
01:44:11,104 --> 01:44:12,813
Get me some rice.

1729
01:44:21,396 --> 01:44:23,270
Stop!
Stop! stop!

1730
01:44:24,104 --> 01:44:25,396
Why are you here?

1731
01:44:26,437 --> 01:44:28,104
Why have you come here?

1732
01:44:29,312 --> 01:44:31,187
I've sent one of your
Products inside.

1733
01:44:31,479 --> 01:44:33,396
He missed you it seems.

1734
01:44:33,437 --> 01:44:35,020
You only spoiled him.

1735
01:44:35,062 --> 01:44:37,229
I'll show you my true colour.
Let the case get over

1736
01:44:37,312 --> 01:44:39,145
We grew him up with
a lot of coddling.

1737
01:44:39,187 --> 01:44:41,396
He was a Faultless boy.
Do you know that?

1738
01:44:41,854 --> 01:44:43,521
What use?

1739
01:44:43,978 --> 01:44:46,729
Children shouldn't be forced
to grow according to your wish

1740
01:44:47,145 --> 01:44:49,729
What is the use of growing him
like a Broiler Chicken?

1741
01:44:49,937 --> 01:44:52,978
He is also an individual who
has desires and dreams.

1742
01:44:53,229 --> 01:44:56,312
Only if you understand it, even
you can be a part of his life.

1743
01:44:57,062 --> 01:44:58,312
Are you still gabbling?

1744
01:44:58,354 --> 01:45:01,396
You come, come,
Walk out I say.

1745
01:45:01,437 --> 01:45:03,020
You wait and see.

1746
01:45:03,321 --> 01:45:04,321
Leave him

1747
01:45:05,539 --> 01:45:07,806
Bringing justice?
- Leave him be!

1748
01:45:09,145 --> 01:45:10,813
- Eat, eat well
- Enough Mom, enough

1749
01:45:10,854 --> 01:45:12,187
I'm full

1750
01:45:12,479 --> 01:45:13,687
Why Kiddo?

1751
01:45:13,729 --> 01:45:14,813
Silly boy.

1752
01:45:14,854 --> 01:45:17,437
It is after how many days
he is eating from here, mom?

1753
01:45:24,437 --> 01:45:25,729
Hey Advocate,

1754
01:45:25,813 --> 01:45:27,062
Start the bike.

1755
01:45:27,104 --> 01:45:28,937
Start the vehicle,
Fast

1756
01:45:34,854 --> 01:45:36,646
Hey Ammini, don't jump.

1757
01:45:38,062 --> 01:45:39,978
- What is that?
- Start the vehicle advocate, Fast!

1758
01:45:40,062 --> 01:45:41,729
Fast! Fast!

1759
01:45:43,396 --> 01:45:45,229
- You tell me the matter.
- Yes, I will

1760
01:46:24,937 --> 01:46:26,813
But, why did you thank him?

1761
01:46:26,937 --> 01:46:28,020
Why is the matter?

1762
01:46:28,187 --> 01:46:30,104
Isn't it because they
got me married,

1763
01:46:30,187 --> 01:46:31,354
I could come for divorce?

1764
01:46:31,646 --> 01:46:32,521
Yes,

1765
01:46:32,562 --> 01:46:34,813
Is that not why I could meet you?

1766
01:46:34,895 --> 01:46:36,854
Only after falling into your hands,

1767
01:46:36,895 --> 01:46:38,646
I started enjoying life?

1768
01:46:49,020 --> 01:46:50,229
All is Great

1769
01:47:16,396 --> 01:47:18,396
It is Pradeepan.

1770
01:47:19,354 --> 01:47:20,854
Yes, Pradeepan

1771
01:47:20,892 --> 01:47:24,854
- How are things there?
- All good, just going to start

1772
01:47:24,978 --> 01:47:27,687
Remember, you rebuked us
saying many things?

1773
01:47:27,729 --> 01:47:30,687
Only YOUR face is seen
on TV now a days.

1774
01:47:31,646 --> 01:47:32,813
Anyways,

1775
01:47:32,854 --> 01:47:34,854
you come here tomorrow.

1776
01:47:35,062 --> 01:47:37,771
We'll discuss about the SEATS.

1777
01:47:37,813 --> 01:47:39,229
Are you serious?

1778
01:47:39,270 --> 01:47:40,771
You come dear.

1779
01:47:41,020 --> 01:47:42,437
We'll talk.

1780
01:47:44,978 --> 01:47:46,937
What is the matter?

1781
01:47:47,396 --> 01:47:49,020
It was Party Secretary.

1782
01:47:49,229 --> 01:47:52,895
- Is it fixed?
- Yeah! - Is it?

1783
01:48:16,020 --> 01:48:17,437
Give him your ID Card

1784
01:48:37,813 --> 01:48:39,147
Hand me that paper!

1785
01:48:41,199 --> 01:48:42,269
Okay, I will inform sir.

1786
01:48:42,293 --> 01:48:43,293
OK.

1787
01:48:49,260 --> 01:48:50,815
Are you getting divorced?

1788
01:48:51,834 --> 01:48:54,085
How long have you
been married?

1789
01:48:54,627 --> 01:48:55,710
Sometime.

1790
01:48:56,043 --> 01:48:57,502
Oh my god!

1791
01:48:57,585 --> 01:48:59,418
For leaving a Lovely
girl like you,

1792
01:48:59,460 --> 01:49:02,252
he should be beaten up with
pestle till death, SATAN.

1793
01:49:02,418 --> 01:49:04,335
Tell him to Get Lost.

1794
01:49:04,418 --> 01:49:07,126
You'll get a Lovable
person as husband.

1795
01:49:07,335 --> 01:49:09,460
Aren't you pretty enough?

1796
01:49:09,543 --> 01:49:11,918
He is not lucky enough
to get your Love.

1797
01:49:12,460 --> 01:49:14,252
I am a Chatterbox,
I know

1798
01:49:14,293 --> 01:49:15,627
Hope you don't mind.

1799
01:49:17,072 --> 01:49:18,072
Fathima!

1800
01:49:20,978 --> 01:49:21,978
Come.

1801
01:49:39,126 --> 01:49:41,126
At least 500 flags should be...

1802
01:49:41,208 --> 01:49:44,074
Advocate, Be careful!
We should win! Okay?

1803
01:49:44,377 --> 01:49:46,543
Pradeepa, I wanna tell
you something.

1804
01:49:46,585 --> 01:49:47,876
- You all carry on.
- OK

1805
01:49:47,960 --> 01:49:49,043
We'll go there

1806
01:49:53,043 --> 01:49:54,502
Pradeepa, you are famous

1807
01:49:54,543 --> 01:49:55,627
not only in Kannur,

1808
01:49:55,669 --> 01:49:57,126
but in the whole of Kerala.

1809
01:49:57,960 --> 01:49:59,043
It's true that

1810
01:49:59,085 --> 01:50:01,210
the youth are crazy about you.

1811
01:50:01,377 --> 01:50:03,043
That is good enough,

1812
01:50:03,543 --> 01:50:06,126
But, there is a trap in this.

1813
01:50:06,960 --> 01:50:10,126
In fact, you are trying to
separate two people right?

1814
01:50:10,543 --> 01:50:13,085
In the opposite side,
it is a Girl

1815
01:50:13,834 --> 01:50:16,335
On a second thought,
You are a Villain

1816
01:50:17,252 --> 01:50:18,960
What do you mean?

1817
01:50:19,960 --> 01:50:22,293
All you Do, should
reflect on Vote, Pradeepa

1818
01:50:22,669 --> 01:50:24,210
Understood?

1819
01:50:25,001 --> 01:50:26,460
So, you proceed.

1820
01:50:40,293 --> 01:50:41,960
Are you not ready?

1821
01:50:42,710 --> 01:50:44,710
Ready for the argument?

1822
01:50:45,001 --> 01:50:46,502
The petition submitted here,

1823
01:50:46,542 --> 01:50:48,284
at a single glance itself,
we'll understand that

1824
01:50:48,337 --> 01:50:49,470
this is baseless.

1825
01:50:49,587 --> 01:50:53,180
This is not at all accepted by
any court of law!

1826
01:50:54,252 --> 01:50:55,918
Didn't you see the reasons?

1827
01:50:55,960 --> 01:50:57,543
Snoring it seems.

1828
01:50:57,613 --> 01:50:59,252
Fatty it seems.

1829
01:51:00,543 --> 01:51:01,960
In any provision,

1830
01:51:02,001 --> 01:51:03,627
due to these reasons,

1831
01:51:03,669 --> 01:51:05,168
do we have the history
of giving a divorce?

1832
01:51:05,210 --> 01:51:07,460
His family tactfully got him
married it seems.

1833
01:51:09,001 --> 01:51:10,793
Was he Dumb?

1834
01:51:10,834 --> 01:51:12,126
Blind?

1835
01:51:12,918 --> 01:51:14,669
Here and now, whether he has
any problem or not,

1836
01:51:14,710 --> 01:51:16,627
god only knows

1837
01:51:17,217 --> 01:51:23,310
Infact, this petition has been filed
for harrassing and insulting my party!

1838
01:51:23,753 --> 01:51:27,220
Hence, this petition may be
dismissed by any cost!

1839
01:51:28,181 --> 01:51:29,181
That's all.

1840
01:51:32,788 --> 01:51:34,654
Advocate Pradeepan, proceed!

1841
01:51:37,684 --> 01:51:38,684
Your Honor!

1842
01:51:39,335 --> 01:51:41,043
Just one single question.

1843
01:51:42,252 --> 01:51:44,293
Like giving a colour pencil,

1844
01:51:44,710 --> 01:51:46,460
Like giving a toy,

1845
01:51:47,001 --> 01:51:48,627
Like giving a dress,

1846
01:51:49,085 --> 01:51:50,627
Is it possible to gift someone,

1847
01:51:50,710 --> 01:51:52,210
A Wife?

1848
01:51:52,585 --> 01:51:53,751
This is Marriage!

1849
01:51:54,116 --> 01:51:57,982
The secret of happy marriage is finding
the right person!

1850
01:51:58,918 --> 01:52:00,585
I'm not saying that Kanthi

1851
01:52:00,669 --> 01:52:02,168
is a bad wife.

1852
01:52:02,502 --> 01:52:05,460
If my client is not able to
find happiness in her,

1853
01:52:05,876 --> 01:52:08,252
Won't it just turn out to be
an adjustment alone?

1854
01:52:08,765 --> 01:52:09,415
Okay.

1855
01:52:09,502 --> 01:52:11,293
Sometimes, they might
adjust also.

1856
01:52:11,335 --> 01:52:13,751
They can pass on any number of
years with this adjustment.

1857
01:52:13,834 --> 01:52:14,834
But,

1858
01:52:15,085 --> 01:52:16,918
Can it be called as a 'Life'?

1859
01:52:17,502 --> 01:52:20,001
I'm never against
Arranged Marriage.

1860
01:52:20,460 --> 01:52:22,710
To satisfy the family and others,

1861
01:52:22,834 --> 01:52:25,460
when you are forcefully
getting married,

1862
01:52:25,502 --> 01:52:27,210
Is it not a kind
of acting?

1863
01:52:28,043 --> 01:52:30,001
The outcome of a marriage
should be

1864
01:52:30,043 --> 01:52:32,460
a perfectly matching couple,

1865
01:52:33,710 --> 01:52:36,460
rather than 2 actors.

1866
01:52:38,862 --> 01:52:40,395
That's all, Your Honor!

1867
01:52:49,617 --> 01:52:52,534
I shall possess for order!
Let me go through the file.

1868
01:52:52,950 --> 01:52:56,007
Verdict is on Jan 20th.

1869
01:53:05,168 --> 01:53:07,710
What the hell is this? How long
I have been waiting for you here?

1870
01:53:08,377 --> 01:53:10,834
Why should I come to select
Invitation letter? Bro, you go.

1871
01:53:10,876 --> 01:53:12,210
No, you must come.

1872
01:53:12,252 --> 01:53:14,252
Only you know the current style.
You come, get on.

1873
01:53:14,335 --> 01:53:15,710
Advocate Pradeepan,

1874
01:53:18,153 --> 01:53:19,153
Hello!

1875
01:53:19,377 --> 01:53:21,293
I wanna say something.

1876
01:53:25,335 --> 01:53:28,627
I still don't know what is
the problem with Shajietan

1877
01:53:29,126 --> 01:53:31,126
I am knowing the reasons
for this divorce

1878
01:53:31,168 --> 01:53:33,293
only when you tell

1879
01:53:36,918 --> 01:53:38,834
I Love him a lot.

1880
01:53:39,585 --> 01:53:41,418
He is my HUSBAND

1881
01:53:43,543 --> 01:53:45,543
Aren't you on the
winning side now?

1882
01:53:45,876 --> 01:53:47,585
Selling our lives,

1883
01:53:47,669 --> 01:53:49,293
didn't you earn Fame?

1884
01:53:50,226 --> 01:53:51,226
Congrats!

1885
01:53:53,710 --> 01:53:54,710
But,

1886
01:53:54,960 --> 01:53:57,335
I can't let me loose the game.

1887
01:53:58,710 --> 01:54:00,543
If I loose in this,

1888
01:54:04,876 --> 01:54:07,585
In this case, I'll only
win, dear advocate.

1889
01:54:08,126 --> 01:54:09,460
Let me go?

1890
01:55:18,335 --> 01:55:20,210
Where?
Where is she?

1891
01:55:24,834 --> 01:55:26,293
She is taking bath.

1892
01:55:26,335 --> 01:55:28,377
- Bathing? Here?
- Yes

1893
01:55:28,418 --> 01:55:29,585
Oh my god!

1894
01:55:36,043 --> 01:55:37,377
What are you trying to prove?

1895
01:55:37,418 --> 01:55:38,834
This is my Office.

1896
01:55:38,876 --> 01:55:40,793
- So what?
- Don't you know?

1897
01:55:41,010 --> 01:55:42,335
You should leave right now.

1898
01:55:42,418 --> 01:55:43,669
What if I don't?

1899
01:55:44,007 --> 01:55:45,395
What if you don't? Hey!

1900
01:55:46,252 --> 01:55:48,460
- Without standing Idle, throw her out
- Me?

1901
01:55:48,543 --> 01:55:49,710
Me, then?

1902
01:55:49,751 --> 01:55:52,377
You can call police,
I'm not going

1903
01:55:52,418 --> 01:55:54,627
I'm staying where
my husband stays.

1904
01:55:54,669 --> 01:55:56,043
Divorce is not yet done.

1905
01:55:56,085 --> 01:55:58,793
Till the verdict, legally,
I'm his wife itself.

1906
01:56:01,210 --> 01:56:02,876
You make a call to her house.

1907
01:56:04,001 --> 01:56:06,293
Pick the bloody phone and call
someone at her house.

1908
01:56:19,543 --> 01:56:20,918
Hello,
Tell me.

1909
01:56:20,960 --> 01:56:22,543
Your daughter,
what is in her mind?

1910
01:56:22,627 --> 01:56:24,335
Please come and take
her with you.

1911
01:56:24,460 --> 01:56:26,210
This is my office.

1912
01:56:26,293 --> 01:56:27,585
Don't put me in trouble.

1913
01:56:27,669 --> 01:56:29,168
What should I do?

1914
01:56:29,502 --> 01:56:31,377
Her life belongs to her.

1915
01:56:35,126 --> 01:56:37,043
What a Prick is your
father-in-law?

1916
01:56:37,085 --> 01:56:38,126
Gosh!

1917
01:56:38,210 --> 01:56:40,168
If you stand outside for a while,

1918
01:56:40,210 --> 01:56:41,793
I could change my dress.

1919
01:56:43,001 --> 01:56:45,293
But, Shajietan can stay back.

1920
01:56:47,543 --> 01:56:49,001
You come out with me?

1921
01:56:50,168 --> 01:56:51,335
What is it bro?

1922
01:56:51,377 --> 01:56:52,918
Nothing,
cleaning is going on.

1923
01:56:53,669 --> 01:56:56,418
What is this, a mare's nest?
Will you make me ashamed?

1924
01:56:59,669 --> 01:57:01,502
Pradeep bro,
there is an idea.

1925
01:57:02,085 --> 01:57:04,793
What if we ask our mates to
make a total fuss out there?

1926
01:57:04,918 --> 01:57:07,168
Can tell Suran to pest
her to the maximum?

1927
01:57:08,001 --> 01:57:09,543
Buddy,
election is coming up.

1928
01:57:09,593 --> 01:57:10,876
I'll loose my face if
anything goes wrong.

1929
01:57:10,918 --> 01:57:12,210
That will not work out.

1930
01:57:13,293 --> 01:57:15,918
Will it be a trap set by R.P.?

1931
01:57:19,126 --> 01:57:20,627
Would it be?

1932
01:57:21,502 --> 01:57:22,751
May be.

1933
01:57:25,252 --> 01:57:27,543
Now, there is only
one way out

1934
01:57:27,585 --> 01:57:29,210
You should advice.

1935
01:57:30,085 --> 01:57:32,252
She'll obey you for sure.

1936
01:57:34,793 --> 01:57:37,001
I'm not courageous
enough, advocate

1937
01:57:37,960 --> 01:57:40,669
She will not eat
you up, OK?

1938
01:57:41,168 --> 01:57:42,669
You come.

1939
01:58:06,585 --> 01:58:07,876
What is this?
A Hotel?

1940
01:58:07,918 --> 01:58:09,710
All set?

1941
01:58:09,876 --> 01:58:12,627
Mixi, Stove, Urn, Pot

1942
01:58:13,293 --> 01:58:15,377
You can live even if you
don't work, Pradeep bro

1943
01:58:15,627 --> 01:58:17,293
Mirror is also there?

1944
01:58:21,418 --> 01:58:23,168
Pradeep bro,
she is coming.

1945
01:58:29,793 --> 01:58:31,126
Tell her.

1946
01:58:32,460 --> 01:58:34,210
You should go from here.

1947
01:58:36,669 --> 01:58:38,252
Didn't you hear?

1948
01:58:38,418 --> 01:58:40,252
You should leave this place.

1949
01:58:40,710 --> 01:58:42,377
Advocate, you don't have to
break your neck for this.

1950
01:58:42,418 --> 01:58:43,793
I'll NOT go.

1951
01:58:43,834 --> 01:58:45,377
I'm as stubborn as a mule.

1952
01:58:45,460 --> 01:58:47,377
Do whatever you can.

1953
01:58:50,876 --> 01:58:52,502
Get Lost you!

1954
01:58:53,960 --> 01:58:55,502
What a dumb are you?

1976
02:03:59,293 --> 02:04:01,043
I'm going.

1977
02:04:02,669 --> 02:04:04,669
Tomorrow is the Verdict,
right?

1978
02:04:11,252 --> 02:04:13,793
The elephant you drew
has come out well.

1979
02:04:24,876 --> 02:04:26,543
I'm also leaving.

1980
02:04:28,418 --> 02:04:30,377
You reach the court
by 10 O'clock.

1981
02:04:30,418 --> 02:04:31,793
I'll be there.

1982
02:04:37,252 --> 02:04:38,918
- You're happy right?
- Yes

1983
02:04:39,126 --> 02:04:40,876
Tomorrow, your case
will get over.

1984
02:04:41,210 --> 02:04:43,543
Thereafter, I don't want you
to stay here.

1985
02:04:43,585 --> 02:04:44,918
You go home.

1986
02:04:45,876 --> 02:04:49,001
Your marriage is valid only
for this night more

1987
02:04:49,543 --> 02:04:51,210
Tomorrow, you'll get Divorce.

1988
02:04:51,710 --> 02:04:53,377
I'm sure about it.

1989
02:04:53,627 --> 02:04:55,710
After that, you can
remarry if you want.

1990
02:04:55,793 --> 02:04:57,710
or else go back to Dubai.

1991
02:05:02,210 --> 02:05:03,460
Also,

1992
02:05:03,585 --> 02:05:04,751
Before going,

1993
02:05:04,793 --> 02:05:07,793
you should settle my fees
without a single penny due.

1994
02:05:08,168 --> 02:05:09,355
Did you hear it?

1995
02:06:06,116 --> 02:06:07,116
160/18

1996
02:06:12,083 --> 02:06:13,436
Are the clients not here?

02:06:13,618 --> 02:06:14,825
Where are they?

1998
02:06:17,201 --> 02:06:18,284
Stay there itself.

1999
02:06:22,451 --> 02:06:23,825
35 pages are there,

2000
02:06:23,867 --> 02:06:25,034
The Judgement!

2001
02:06:25,326 --> 02:06:26,534

2002
02:06:26,561 --> 02:06:27,561
R.P.?

2003
02:06:27,992 --> 02:06:29,582
No need.
- Okay.

2004
02:06:29,867 --> 02:06:31,159
I'm not reading it fully.

2005
02:06:31,201 --> 02:06:32,409

Now, can you believe
what I'm saying?

2036
02:09:44,701 --> 02:09:46,117
There is something.

02:09:53,243 --> 02:09:54,992
But, you only got
divorced now right?

2041
02:09:55,076 --> 02:09:57,326
Yes, But...

2042
02:09:57,576 --> 02:09:59,117
So, did you people Reunite?

2043
02:09:59,368 --> 02:10:00,368

Wish you a happy married life!
Okay.

2054
02:10:25,825 --> 02:10:27,576
I'm here trusting YOU

2055
02:10:27,701 --> 02:10:30,243
I come and go everytime,
but nothing is working out

2056
02:10:30,284 --> 02:10:34,117
Am I repeatedly saying that I'll get
you the bail, for the past 3 months?

2057
02:10:34,201 --> 02:10:36,201
- You are a Big-Mouth, I know
- Bring him next month

2058
02:10:36,326 --> 02:10:38,076
His Dialogues are pretty interesting.

2059
02:10:38,159 --> 02:10:40,243
I need to get back soon.
We've Chicken today.

2060
02:11:00,951 --> 02:11:02,076
Pradeepa,

2061
02:11:02,117 --> 02:11:03,867
Not everyone has to be separated.

2062
02:11:04,825 --> 02:11:07,326
Can't advocates advocate
reunion as well?

2063
02:11:08,201 --> 02:11:10,326
If you get such a chance in this case,

2064
02:11:10,368 --> 02:11:11,701
you should do it OK?

2065
02:11:11,909 --> 02:11:13,409
Not an advice but,

2066
02:11:13,784 --> 02:11:16,493
Otherwise, you'll
be both, a lost Advocate

2067
02:11:16,660 --> 02:11:18,701
and a defeated human being.

2068
02:11:26,409 --> 02:11:28,117
Kanthi, can you stand with me?

2069
02:11:28,701 --> 02:11:30,284
Sis, you come, get up.

2070
02:11:35,576 --> 02:11:37,992
This is just a Try

2071
02:11:38,201 --> 02:11:39,368
Not sure.

2072
02:11:39,576 --> 02:11:41,117
A 50-50 chance.

2073
02:11:49,157 --> 02:11:50,157
Go ahead!

2074
02:11:58,867 --> 02:12:01,243
Pradeep bro, How did
you reunite them?

2075
02:12:01,660 --> 02:12:04,201
Wasn't he as tough as old boots?

2076
02:12:04,326 --> 02:12:05,618
That is simple.

2077
02:12:05,992 --> 02:12:08,867
They lived together only for 7 days.

2078
02:12:09,034 --> 02:12:12,076
But, lived for this Case for 1 year.

2079
02:12:12,326 --> 02:12:15,284
Morethan the negetives that
he saw within these 7 days,

2080
02:12:15,784 --> 02:12:19,201
I could show him, atleast one
positive side of Kanthi

2081
02:12:19,243 --> 02:12:20,368
That's all

2082
02:12:26,201 --> 02:12:28,618
If people understand each other,

2083
02:12:28,701 --> 02:12:30,576
Not 5, not 50,

2084
02:12:30,660 --> 02:12:32,618
Can live 500 years together.

2085
02:12:32,784 --> 02:12:34,117
Happily!

2086
02:12:55,493 --> 02:12:59,117
Thalassery's own Lovely son,
Manjodi's own youngling,

2087
02:12:59,201 --> 02:13:03,076
The Roaring lion in the court,
The eye-ball of Youth,

2088
02:13:03,159 --> 02:13:04,909
Nightmare of anti-socials,

2089
02:13:04,992 --> 02:13:06,867
The Gem who works really hard
from Dawn to Dusk,

2090
02:13:06,909 --> 02:13:08,701
for the betterment of Thalassery,

2091
02:13:08,784 --> 02:13:11,951
The one and only
Pradeepan Manjodi, BA. LLB.

2092
02:13:11,992 --> 02:13:18,618
Please vote for him dear friends.
