1
00:04:01,688 --> 00:04:04,680
Ever since the terrorists have
started using mobile phones...

2
00:04:05,025 --> 00:04:08,358
we have developed a new software,
from the security point of view

3
00:04:08,862 --> 00:04:11,023
it has been fed into this system

4
00:04:13,867 --> 00:04:17,359
Whenever words like murder, rape,
RDX or bombs are associated...

5
00:04:17,437 --> 00:04:22,374
with the names of VIPs, their number
will be flashed on this immediately

6
00:04:22,709 --> 00:04:27,043
I've noticed objectionable words being
used several times since this morning...

7
00:04:27,113 --> 00:04:31,049
on this number.
On whose name is the number registered?

8
00:04:31,384 --> 00:04:33,375
We've checked the records
of the cell-phone operator

9
00:04:33,486 --> 00:04:36,216
The name and address are fakes.
- Naturally

10
00:04:36,556 --> 00:04:38,888
The cell-phone company wants
to sell its services...

11
00:04:38,992 --> 00:04:41,051
whether it's a tourist
or a terrorist

12
00:04:41,394 --> 00:04:44,386
Switch on the location
identification system

13
00:04:44,731 --> 00:04:48,064
Tell me where the cell-phone user is
right now

14
00:04:51,237 --> 00:04:54,229
The caller is at the poolside
of Hotel Sunshine

15
00:04:55,408 --> 00:04:59,401
Keep me posted on
every movement of his

16
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:23,092
Your cell-phone was out of range, sir.
- I'm at the poolside now. Go on

17
00:05:23,269 --> 00:05:25,260
That cell-phone is now
out of range, sir

18
00:05:37,884 --> 00:05:39,943
He's in room number 204
of the same hotel

19
00:05:51,631 --> 00:05:57,467
There's no one in the room, Mike.
- Our system still shows...

20
00:05:59,572 --> 00:06:01,072
that the cellphone is in room 204

21
00:06:11,217 --> 00:06:14,482
Akram Shaikh,
you will always lag behind

22
00:06:15,655 --> 00:06:18,647
So they knew we've
been following them

23
00:06:19,325 --> 00:06:23,159
I found this map of Mumbai
from the bedroom

24
00:06:26,499 --> 00:06:31,493
This looks like L sir.
- L...? Could also be 7

25
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:37,003
What's with L or 7 that the terrorists
could target in Mumbai?

26
00:06:37,343 --> 00:06:40,176
7-ways, 7-bungalows...?

27
00:06:41,681 --> 00:06:44,514
Lamington Road, Lokhandwala,
Linking Road...?

28
00:06:54,694 --> 00:06:57,356
Which means, one of the three
is a woman

29
00:07:10,877 --> 00:07:13,209
Mr Dara, they're here

30
00:07:34,734 --> 00:07:38,226
Only we brothers have
the right to search her

31
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:19,771
Many happy returns
of the day, Mr Dara

32
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:24,273
You turn 60 today and there will
be a grand party this evening

33
00:08:25,285 --> 00:08:27,276
But we regret,
we will not be able to attend

34
00:08:27,353 --> 00:08:31,289
So we thought of personally
wishing you on your birthday

35
00:08:32,792 --> 00:08:34,623
You are a father-figure to us

36
00:08:34,727 --> 00:08:37,457
The Godfather in the business
of arms-running

37
00:08:37,964 --> 00:08:39,955
Please accept your birthday gift

38
00:08:43,303 --> 00:08:45,794
You're the one who has it, right?
- Strange!

39
00:08:45,905 --> 00:08:47,304
How would it be with me?
It's with you!

40
00:08:47,373 --> 00:08:49,967
But you were supposed to carry it!
- Rubbish. it was you...

41
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:54,303
No, no. it's not okay.
- We must give you the gift

42
00:10:09,555 --> 00:10:12,718
I had to make you
belong to me...

43
00:10:13,393 --> 00:10:16,385
this meeting was just a pretext

44
00:10:24,737 --> 00:10:27,729
I wanted to
steal your heart...

45
00:10:28,741 --> 00:10:31,904
this meeting
was just a pretext

46
00:10:33,012 --> 00:10:36,413
Apocalypse...

47
00:10:36,816 --> 00:10:39,410
I spell apocalypse

48
00:11:22,962 --> 00:11:26,454
I haven't slept
many nights...'

49
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:30,291
you are the one
I've been thinking about

50
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:33,962
I've even touched it...

51
00:11:34,207 --> 00:11:37,802
your body's as clear
as crystal

52
00:11:41,481 --> 00:11:44,814
A spell I wanted to cast...

53
00:11:45,485 --> 00:11:48,477
this meeting
was just a pretext

54
00:11:49,422 --> 00:11:52,323
I wanted to
steal your heart...

55
00:11:53,326 --> 00:11:55,988
this meeting
was just a pretext

56
00:11:57,330 --> 00:12:00,822
Apocalypse...

57
00:12:01,234 --> 00:12:04,328
I spell apocalypse

58
00:12:05,171 --> 00:12:08,504
Apocalypse...

59
00:12:09,008 --> 00:12:11,841
you spell apocalypse

60
00:12:45,978 --> 00:12:48,879
In your arms,
I want to live...

61
00:12:49,215 --> 00:12:52,878
On your eyes,
I want to be drunk

62
00:12:53,219 --> 00:12:56,711
The redness of my lips...

63
00:12:56,889 --> 00:13:00,381
I have preserved only for you

64
00:13:04,063 --> 00:13:07,396
I wished to drive you mad...

65
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:11,063
this meeting
was just an excuse

66
00:13:12,238 --> 00:13:15,401
I wanted to
steal your heart...

67
00:13:15,575 --> 00:13:18,908
this meeting
was just a pretext

68
00:13:20,313 --> 00:13:23,908
Apocalypse...

69
00:13:24,183 --> 00:13:26,913
you spell apocalypse

70
00:13:27,687 --> 00:13:31,418
Apocalypse...

71
00:13:31,591 --> 00:13:34,424
I spell apocalypse

72
00:14:29,649 --> 00:14:31,640
You've already killed, Dara

73
00:14:32,818 --> 00:14:36,310
However, children...
times are bad

74
00:14:37,657 --> 00:14:41,821
I have news from the CBI that one
Akram Shaikh is hot on your trail

75
00:14:42,161 --> 00:14:45,324
He'll always keep trailing.
- In missiles and arms...

76
00:14:45,398 --> 00:14:50,665
we've gone too far ahead anyway.
- If you get caught...

77
00:14:51,003 --> 00:14:53,494
I won't remain the Home Minister
anymore. Do you understand that?

78
00:14:53,673 --> 00:14:57,666
If this deal goes through, you will
become the Chief Minister, Uncle

79
00:14:59,345 --> 00:15:01,677
Don't call me Uncle, okay?

80
00:15:05,184 --> 00:15:07,675
You're very mischievous. Now tell me.
what are you doing about Akram Shaikh?

81
00:15:24,036 --> 00:15:26,027
Did that hurt?

82
00:15:33,212 --> 00:15:35,043
I'll tell you!

83
00:15:35,214 --> 00:15:38,877
Ali, Abbas...
- Damn it, Suresh-bhai!

84
00:15:39,719 --> 00:15:44,213
Why didn't you tell me earlier? Why do
you provoke violence in Gandhi's land?

85
00:15:49,562 --> 00:15:51,553
Has he told you something?

86
00:15:52,231 --> 00:15:55,564
A police beating is quite
something else, sir

87
00:15:56,068 --> 00:15:58,559
Even the mute start singing

88
00:16:01,741 --> 00:16:03,732
My suspicion was right, sir

89
00:16:03,809 --> 00:16:06,073
Small-time thieves four years ago,
Ali and Abbas...

90
00:16:06,912 --> 00:16:09,073
are today's biggest arms-dealers

91
00:16:10,082 --> 00:16:13,245
Ever since America is keeping
a vigil on other countries...

92
00:16:14,253 --> 00:16:18,087
these terrorists want to turn India
into a marketplace for firearms

93
00:16:19,091 --> 00:16:22,083
We will not let India get a bad name
in the rest of the world

94
00:16:27,099 --> 00:16:29,260
You are now in-charge of the case

95
00:16:30,436 --> 00:16:35,271
Sir, Dara's murder, the seizure
of the map from the hotel room...

96
00:16:36,776 --> 00:16:38,767
I don't know why,
but I feel...

97
00:16:39,278 --> 00:16:45,615
that there's a storm in the offing.
The city's under threat, sir

98
00:16:55,127 --> 00:16:58,790
We've been after Dara for so
many days for these weapons

99
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:01,790
And now we get our hands on them

100
00:17:03,135 --> 00:17:07,799
What a figure!
Sleek and sexy!

101
00:17:08,307 --> 00:17:10,969
We only need a virus now.
- Funny!

102
00:17:11,143 --> 00:17:14,635
Not even the girls I promise marriage
every day are as suspicious

103
00:17:14,814 --> 00:17:17,146
I told you,
you'll have the virus

104
00:17:17,316 --> 00:17:19,307
In which case, the government
will go down on its knees

105
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:22,481
We can spell doom

106
00:17:22,822 --> 00:17:25,154
How about making a call
to Brigadier Rashid...?

107
00:17:26,158 --> 00:17:28,149
Our contact in the ISI

108
00:17:28,494 --> 00:17:33,158
This cake in the shape of India,
in the flavour of pistachio...

109
00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:36,328
in green! it's going to be fun
relishing it

110
00:17:39,338 --> 00:17:43,172
Ali Abbas! Have you got
your hands on those missiles?

111
00:17:43,342 --> 00:17:47,506
Yes, you need to help us now.
And we will help you

112
00:17:47,847 --> 00:17:49,838
it's like this, brother

113
00:17:50,015 --> 00:17:53,507
Every Muslim from the land of the
infidels finds shelter in our land

114
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,852
Anyone who teaches the infidels
a lesson...

115
00:17:57,356 --> 00:17:59,847
becomes the King of the palaces
of Karachi

116
00:18:00,693 --> 00:18:02,684
You must teach them a lesson too

117
00:18:03,863 --> 00:18:07,026
The serial bomb-blasts of '93
are fading from memory

118
00:18:07,466 --> 00:18:10,867
What Dara could never do,
we will do

119
00:18:11,103 --> 00:18:13,697
Wow! Wonderful!

120
00:18:14,874 --> 00:18:17,536
Take shelter from us.
And take the money from them

121
00:18:18,711 --> 00:18:20,702
God protect you.
- God protect you

122
00:18:27,052 --> 00:18:32,217
Mr Vajpayee wants peace.
And we want pieces

123
00:18:33,392 --> 00:18:35,383
Pieces of India

124
00:18:36,729 --> 00:18:42,395
Especially this one... Kashmir

125
00:18:47,239 --> 00:18:50,402
Our virus will show such magic
in Bombay...

126
00:18:51,911 --> 00:18:55,904
that talks between the countries
will collapse, even before they begin

127
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:02,915
This virus could very well become
a bigger issue than Kashmir

128
00:19:10,429 --> 00:19:12,761
A delegation from the Defence
Ministry has arrived, sir

129
00:19:12,998 --> 00:19:15,432
The director wants you to
brief them on the virus

130
00:19:20,606 --> 00:19:23,598
Sir, these important files are
going to the U.N.

131
00:19:23,943 --> 00:19:25,934
Please sign them

132
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:41,950
How are you, Gopal?
- How should I be?

133
00:19:42,461 --> 00:19:46,295
I hear you're going to brief a
delegation from the Defence Ministry?

134
00:19:46,465 --> 00:19:50,959
You will go to America to do a research
at the director's recommendation...

135
00:19:51,036 --> 00:19:54,472
and when you return, you will be
the join-director, sir!

136
00:19:54,807 --> 00:19:56,798
How am I to feel?

137
00:19:57,476 --> 00:20:03,813
I've worked all night and prepared
a progressive report on the virus

138
00:20:13,492 --> 00:20:20,330
Our research team is being headed by a
young, brilliant scientist Rahul Gupta

139
00:20:27,006 --> 00:20:29,497
The enemy every day warns
us of a nuclear war

140
00:20:30,009 --> 00:20:32,341
He prepares chemical
and biological weapons

141
00:20:33,445 --> 00:20:35,675
Our intelligence have unearthed
the information...

142
00:20:36,348 --> 00:20:38,680
that the enemy has
developed this virus

143
00:20:39,184 --> 00:20:43,348
if this virus is dropped in our
country through missiles...

144
00:20:43,455 --> 00:20:47,357
people will suffer to death.
No one will survive

145
00:20:48,627 --> 00:20:50,857
Air, water and land...

146
00:20:51,363 --> 00:20:53,854
wherever this virus explodes...

147
00:20:54,366 --> 00:20:57,858
it will affect the nervous system of
everyone in a radius of 10 kilometers

148
00:20:58,037 --> 00:21:00,369
Our research team is therefore
preparing an antidote

149
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:05,033
An anti-virus, like the ones used
for Cholera and Typhoid

150
00:21:05,377 --> 00:21:07,538
Should this virus
be mixed in water...

151
00:21:08,047 --> 00:21:10,880
we're trying to develop something that
will prevent it from becoming poisonous

152
00:21:12,217 --> 00:21:16,551
A virus as deadly as this one,
no human brain has ever given birth to

153
00:21:19,058 --> 00:21:21,049
But our research-team has
made good progress

154
00:21:21,727 --> 00:21:24,560
In a month or two, we will
succeed in our mission

155
00:21:44,416 --> 00:21:46,407
I've even asked for Vodka today

156
00:21:49,521 --> 00:21:53,082
Rahul, there's no one
in my house tonight

157
00:21:53,525 --> 00:21:55,425
Why? Where has everyone gone?

158
00:21:57,763 --> 00:21:59,253
Daddy's in Bangalore, Mummy's...

159
00:22:01,767 --> 00:22:04,099
Dr Kalam is there too.
He's got a lovely lab

160
00:22:16,448 --> 00:22:20,441
Tonight, I'm all alone
in my house

161
00:22:21,453 --> 00:22:25,116
Now look, just don't be afraid.
Keep the doors and windows shut

162
00:22:25,791 --> 00:22:29,124
Keep a torch within reach.
If possible, call Bunty over...

163
00:22:34,133 --> 00:22:36,124
There's something I wish
to tell you today

164
00:22:39,138 --> 00:22:40,127
What?

165
00:22:42,474 --> 00:22:46,467
Will you marry me?

166
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:03,992
Sheetal, you...?

167
00:24:18,904 --> 00:24:23,568
I've fallen in love

168
00:24:25,911 --> 00:24:30,405
Something's happened to me, my love

169
00:24:33,252 --> 00:24:39,248
In your arms,
my body...

170
00:24:40,092 --> 00:24:44,085
melts in the heat

171
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:21,122
Shut the windows, my love...

172
00:25:21,233 --> 00:25:24,134
let me draw the curtains

173
00:25:24,636 --> 00:25:30,632
Let's do away with the distances
between us, my love

174
00:25:31,376 --> 00:25:35,642
A miracle...
has occurred

175
00:25:38,083 --> 00:25:42,486
Something's happened to me, my love

176
00:25:45,324 --> 00:25:50,990
In my arms,
your aching body...

177
00:25:51,663 --> 00:25:55,997
melts in the heat

178
00:25:59,004 --> 00:26:02,997
I've fallen in love

179
00:26:05,844 --> 00:26:10,008
Something's happened to me, my love

180
00:26:12,351 --> 00:26:18,688
In your arms,
my body...

181
00:26:19,358 --> 00:26:23,852
melts in the heat

182
00:26:46,385 --> 00:26:49,047
I'm leaving for the trip.
The boat's ready

183
00:26:51,623 --> 00:26:53,887
You ought to have joined me, stupid

184
00:26:55,727 --> 00:26:58,059
I've got work to do.
Some intense work

185
00:26:58,163 --> 00:27:02,725
I know your intense work.
Listen...

186
00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:07,161
Listen, Rahul...

187
00:27:29,428 --> 00:27:32,420
I found the virus-ball lying
outside on my table

188
00:27:33,432 --> 00:27:35,093
it ought to be in the safe!

189
00:27:43,442 --> 00:27:45,933
Sir, Gopal was here last evening

190
00:27:52,451 --> 00:27:54,442
This is the Elphinston Jail

191
00:27:55,120 --> 00:28:00,114
Many notorious criminals used
to be held here

192
00:28:00,225 --> 00:28:04,127
And how were they brought here?
- Just as you were brought here

193
00:28:04,463 --> 00:28:08,456
Mister, I'm the one she asked.
Why did you answer the question?

194
00:28:08,567 --> 00:28:11,468
Because I know a lot
about this jail too

195
00:28:11,636 --> 00:28:14,469
Maybe you do. But why
snatch my livelihood?

196
00:28:14,806 --> 00:28:17,297
How will I tell you what
else I'm going to snatch?

197
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:22,474
This jail is surrounded by the sea.
No prisoner could therefore run away

198
00:28:22,814 --> 00:28:25,476
How do you know the detailed
history of this jail?

199
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:30,485
I know of the things that happened,
and also what's about to happen

200
00:28:30,989 --> 00:28:33,321
Please come... let's go
towards the lock-ups

201
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:45,493
This is the place where dreaded
criminals were held for years...

202
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:49,836
without any food or water.
You sleep in your houses...

203
00:28:49,908 --> 00:28:54,504
with the air-conditioners on.
But take a look in these jails

204
00:28:54,846 --> 00:28:57,007
You will learn a huge lesson!

205
00:28:58,683 --> 00:28:59,843
I was only kidding!

206
00:28:59,951 --> 00:29:05,184
I only wanted you to feel
what those prisoners felt

207
00:29:05,357 --> 00:29:08,349
Take a look at these jails.
Maybe they'll wash away your sins

208
00:29:16,034 --> 00:29:18,195
May you be blessed
in jail!

209
00:29:24,876 --> 00:29:26,867
Everybody's in...?

210
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:42,891
What's happening here?

211
00:29:43,228 --> 00:29:45,219
It's the beginning of a game

212
00:29:46,064 --> 00:29:50,728
You're the prisoners.
And we're the jailors

213
00:29:57,742 --> 00:30:00,575
it's no use trying to
use your mobile-phones

214
00:30:00,679 --> 00:30:03,239
We've jammed your
mobile-phones here

215
00:30:04,182 --> 00:30:05,740
Who are you...?

216
00:30:06,017 --> 00:30:08,577
I'm no guide.
I'm a scientist

217
00:30:08,687 --> 00:30:11,588
And now starts a deadly game

218
00:30:24,436 --> 00:30:26,597
We're holding you hostages

219
00:30:27,606 --> 00:30:32,100
Till the government meets our demands,
you folks will remain here

220
00:30:32,611 --> 00:30:36,945
We have no enmity against you.
But you must do as we say

221
00:30:37,282 --> 00:30:39,273
Get us out of here!

222
00:30:44,122 --> 00:30:48,115
Surround the jail with guards.
Use the radars

223
00:30:49,961 --> 00:30:52,122
At every entry point,
deploy motion sensors

224
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:18,821
James, what's this?
- It's a motion sensor

225
00:31:19,324 --> 00:31:23,158
Whenever someone gets close to it,
our computers will alert us

226
00:31:23,662 --> 00:31:27,655
And if someone even defuses it,
we'll still get to know

227
00:31:28,667 --> 00:31:31,329
You mean we'll get to know immediately
that someone has arrived?

228
00:31:33,338 --> 00:31:35,670
Where have you placed
the seven missiles?

229
00:31:38,009 --> 00:31:41,501
One's in the tower,
two in the library...

230
00:31:42,681 --> 00:31:46,173
two in the ammunition room,
and two in the Portuguese room

231
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:51,511
I've connected you both
to the C.M.'s phone

232
00:31:58,930 --> 00:32:01,694
C.M., bad news for you

233
00:32:02,033 --> 00:32:04,194
We've turned the Elphinston Jail
into a prison again

234
00:32:04,436 --> 00:32:06,427
What rubbish are you talking?
Who are you?

235
00:32:06,538 --> 00:32:10,201
Don't interrupt. Talk only when
we ask you to. Go ahead now

236
00:32:10,375 --> 00:32:12,536
Why're you asking him to talk?
- Okay, shut up!

237
00:32:13,445 --> 00:32:15,037
You talk.
- Who are you?

238
00:32:15,213 --> 00:32:17,875
You speak up again!
So let me tell you

239
00:32:22,721 --> 00:32:24,712
We're madmen...

240
00:32:24,823 --> 00:32:28,224
by the end, we're going
to turn you mad too

241
00:32:31,730 --> 00:32:35,723
We've captured 213 tourists.
Including some foreigners

242
00:32:36,067 --> 00:32:37,227
Who are you?

243
00:32:37,402 --> 00:32:40,894
Who are we...?

244
00:32:41,573 --> 00:32:44,736
Why? You want to get your
daughter married to them?

245
00:32:47,579 --> 00:32:51,413
Even if you want to,
don't offer the guests any water

246
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:54,241
if they drink the water,
they're doing to die!

247
00:32:58,089 --> 00:33:02,082
With our missiles, we have
targeted the seven lakes...

248
00:33:02,761 --> 00:33:04,752
which supply drinking water
to the whole of Mumbai

249
00:33:05,096 --> 00:33:08,088
Our missiles are carrying
not just explosives...

250
00:33:08,166 --> 00:33:09,758
there's also the virus we have
stolen from the CDC Lab

251
00:33:11,269 --> 00:33:16,764
C.M., if you don't meet our demands,
we'll let go of a missile...

252
00:33:17,108 --> 00:33:19,269
and the whole of Mumbai
will perish with the water

253
00:33:21,112 --> 00:33:24,275
Don't talk, C.M.
Just watch the teaser

254
00:33:24,616 --> 00:33:26,277
At the lake in Goregaon

255
00:33:27,952 --> 00:33:29,943
Full of emotions...

256
00:33:30,388 --> 00:33:32,379
and cries of agony

257
00:33:43,134 --> 00:33:45,125
Cancel all my appointments
for the day...

258
00:33:50,475 --> 00:33:51,305
What's happening here...?

259
00:33:52,811 --> 00:33:54,802
28 people are dead,
a child's suffering...

260
00:33:54,979 --> 00:33:56,970
tell us something, sir!

261
00:34:02,153 --> 00:34:04,144
The effect of the virus

262
00:34:06,991 --> 00:34:08,982
Take a look at this, sir

263
00:34:26,511 --> 00:34:28,672
I need samples of this water.
- Okay, sir

264
00:34:38,857 --> 00:34:40,848
People have died
a horrible death!

265
00:34:41,025 --> 00:34:44,188
We've seen 29 bodies today,
it'll be 2.9 million soon!

266
00:34:44,295 --> 00:34:48,857
I'm glad they haven't contaminated
the air to terrorise us

267
00:34:49,534 --> 00:34:51,525
They've only contaminated
the well water

268
00:34:55,874 --> 00:34:57,865
One moment.
Call from Elphinston Jail, sir

269
00:35:04,048 --> 00:35:06,209
15 billion and a ship
to get out of here

270
00:35:06,718 --> 00:35:08,709
What?
- Aren't you recording it?

271
00:35:08,887 --> 00:35:10,218
Listen to what you've recorded

272
00:35:12,056 --> 00:35:16,049
You have 24 hours.
- I get it

273
00:35:16,227 --> 00:35:18,559
You speak up again?
All right, go ahead

274
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:21,221
You must speak now and then

275
00:35:24,736 --> 00:35:31,403
As for what we can do, you've seen
a sample at the well in Goregaon

276
00:35:33,912 --> 00:35:37,905
I'll explain. Until we have
sailed across the Arabian Sea...

277
00:35:38,016 --> 00:35:40,576
the 213 hostages will
remain with us on the ship

278
00:35:41,419 --> 00:35:43,910
You're already using your brains...

279
00:35:43,988 --> 00:35:45,979
as to what you've got to do
in the next 24 hours

280
00:35:46,925 --> 00:35:48,756
Tell him, James

281
00:35:48,927 --> 00:35:52,419
Anything done within a radius
of 3 kilometers of this jail...

282
00:35:53,431 --> 00:35:55,922
will see our missile land in
the seven lakes of Mumbai

283
00:36:00,271 --> 00:36:04,765
if you try to explode the missile
in mid-air, they'll no doubt blow up

284
00:36:05,109 --> 00:36:07,942
But the virus will spread
everywhere in the atmosphere...

285
00:36:08,279 --> 00:36:10,440
and kill all of you.
You get that?

286
00:36:11,282 --> 00:36:14,445
24 hours... to doomsday

287
00:36:20,391 --> 00:36:22,951
These criminals who have taken
over the Elphinston jail...

288
00:36:23,962 --> 00:36:28,626
are they indeed capable of doing
something so dangerous?

289
00:36:29,033 --> 00:36:31,627
They are. Akram...?

290
00:36:38,309 --> 00:36:40,300
Ali Rehmani

291
00:36:44,315 --> 00:36:48,149
He found many jobs, but because
of his abusive nature...

292
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:52,153
and his bad habits,
he couldn't keep any job

293
00:36:57,829 --> 00:36:59,820
Abbas Rehmani

294
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,491
Like this brother,
very intelligent...

295
00:37:05,336 --> 00:37:07,327
dreams of becoming rich overnight

296
00:37:08,006 --> 00:37:11,999
The two of them deal in defence
equipment only in name

297
00:37:13,177 --> 00:37:17,511
But actually, they're agents of
international arms-smugglers

298
00:37:20,685 --> 00:37:22,016
Laila

299
00:37:22,353 --> 00:37:25,015
Once the life of the discos
in Bombay

300
00:37:27,025 --> 00:37:28,686
She's the life of the
two brothers now

301
00:37:30,762 --> 00:37:34,027
James Ricardo.
The gang's techno-brains

302
00:37:34,365 --> 00:37:36,356
He used to work for the NASA earlier

303
00:37:37,368 --> 00:37:41,862
Murthy, worked in an explosives
factory. Expert at explosives

304
00:37:42,373 --> 00:37:44,534
Lop, a radar-expert

305
00:37:50,381 --> 00:37:54,374
There's another thing. As smart as
they are in committing a crime...

306
00:37:56,054 --> 00:37:58,045
they're equally adept
at wiping out the evidence

307
00:37:58,890 --> 00:38:02,883
Which is why, we have only
information. We have no evidence

308
00:38:03,895 --> 00:38:06,728
We have informers,
no witnesses

309
00:38:07,899 --> 00:38:10,060
ls there no way we can
survive this virus?

310
00:38:10,902 --> 00:38:13,564
This virus spreads very quickly
in air and water, sir

311
00:38:14,072 --> 00:38:17,235
In Mumbai, it'll spread faster
because of the humid conditions

312
00:38:19,077 --> 00:38:22,410
This virus could perhaps be
destroyed with fire

313
00:38:22,747 --> 00:38:24,738
We're still experimenting, sir

314
00:38:25,583 --> 00:38:28,074
To begin with, alert the navy

315
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:34,084
Seal the area, 3 kilometers in
the radius of the Elphinston Jail

316
00:38:34,425 --> 00:38:38,759
So that no vessel, whether it belongs
to the fishermen or the government...

317
00:38:38,830 --> 00:38:42,095
goes there. Also declare the area
as a no-flying zone

318
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:47,094
Alert all the emergency services.
And please...

319
00:38:47,205 --> 00:38:51,266
think of a sure-shot plan to
rid ourselves of this crisis

320
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:54,101
I'll go and have a word
with the P.M.

321
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:32,472
Why that smoke...?
- Reaction

322
00:39:34,819 --> 00:39:37,310
Oh God! We must get the gas
out of the chamber!

323
00:39:37,488 --> 00:39:40,651
Else, they can't get out either.
The gas will spread through the lab

324
00:39:42,493 --> 00:39:43,892
The experiment has succeeded

325
00:39:45,163 --> 00:39:47,154
Put the concentrate
in the test-tube

326
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:50,891
This virus can be destroyed
with fire

327
00:39:58,676 --> 00:40:00,667
10 seconds more

328
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:16,183
We've fixed sensors and motion
detectors on all the ways to the jail

329
00:40:16,861 --> 00:40:19,694
if the C.M. acts smart,
they're going to get caught

330
00:40:21,699 --> 00:40:24,532
We've even laid
landmines everywhere

331
00:40:24,869 --> 00:40:29,033
You've got to watch your step, Laila.
- What for?

332
00:40:30,041 --> 00:40:33,374
If you are blown up, we brothers
are going to be widowed

333
00:40:38,549 --> 00:40:40,540
I hope you've marked the areas
where you laid the landmines

334
00:40:41,052 --> 00:40:43,043
I want to live. With her

335
00:40:43,888 --> 00:40:47,551
And I... want to die with her

336
00:40:47,959 --> 00:40:50,553
Even if we die, we'll take
the whole of Mumbai with us

337
00:40:54,565 --> 00:40:56,226
This news must not be
leaked to the media

338
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:58,734
Any contact with the tourists' kin?
- Yes, sir

339
00:40:58,903 --> 00:41:01,394
They have been taken
into confidence

340
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:05,073
What about the firebombs?
- The air-force's firebombs...

341
00:41:05,176 --> 00:41:08,236
will burn everyone there
along with the virus

342
00:41:09,247 --> 00:41:11,238
I hope that moment never arrives

343
00:41:13,751 --> 00:41:15,912
How are we to attack them?

344
00:41:16,254 --> 00:41:20,247
If their radar intercepts our bombs,
their missiles will all be fired

345
00:41:20,424 --> 00:41:22,415
And Mumbai...!

346
00:41:26,597 --> 00:41:28,929
There is a way, sir.
- Which one?

347
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:32,761
To get into the jail
through the water

348
00:41:33,437 --> 00:41:38,431
In the sea is a secret way, where
there are several other tunnels

349
00:41:39,277 --> 00:41:42,940
One of the tunnels leads to the
septic tank in the jail

350
00:41:43,948 --> 00:41:46,610
And there's just one man
who knows about it

351
00:41:48,786 --> 00:41:50,447
But there's a problem, sir.
- What?

352
00:41:50,621 --> 00:41:54,614
The man who knows about the way,
is serving a term in the Pune jail

353
00:41:54,959 --> 00:41:57,120
What...? How does he...?

354
00:41:57,295 --> 00:42:01,629
He's the only man who successfully
ran away from the Elphinston Jail

355
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:04,291
What is he serving a sentence for?

356
00:42:04,802 --> 00:42:07,794
Murder. There are other
charges against him too

357
00:42:09,807 --> 00:42:12,298
You want to take the help
of a criminal like him?

358
00:42:12,476 --> 00:42:15,968
Yes. Do we have a choice?

359
00:42:18,316 --> 00:42:22,650
How will such a man pull off
something so difficult?

360
00:42:22,987 --> 00:42:25,148
Hatred is an intense power, sir

361
00:42:25,323 --> 00:42:30,158
He was once a friend of Ali and Abbas.
He's their enemy today

362
00:42:35,166 --> 00:42:37,498
Sir, call from the PMO

363
00:42:43,274 --> 00:42:47,005
How did you find out
so much about this criminal?

364
00:42:47,178 --> 00:42:50,011
A man who can run away
from the Elphinston Jail...

365
00:42:50,348 --> 00:42:56,344
is someone we must have information on.
Sir, please take a look at his file

366
00:42:57,355 --> 00:43:00,518
I've only told you about the hatred
he harbours in his heart

367
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:04,021
But the sentiment that
drove him to break jail...

368
00:43:05,196 --> 00:43:08,359
was his love for someone

369
00:43:20,044 --> 00:43:23,377
Loneliness everywhere...

370
00:43:23,714 --> 00:43:26,706
somberness in the air

371
00:43:27,218 --> 00:43:30,551
Her memories...

372
00:43:30,721 --> 00:43:33,713
bring tears to my eyes

373
00:43:37,728 --> 00:43:40,720
I breathe restlessly...

374
00:43:41,232 --> 00:43:44,395
there's an ache in my heart

375
00:43:44,735 --> 00:43:47,898
Separated from my beloved...

376
00:43:48,406 --> 00:43:51,398
life is no fun at all

377
00:43:52,410 --> 00:43:57,746
She torments me so much...

378
00:43:58,916 --> 00:44:04,752
that girl I miss so much

379
00:44:12,763 --> 00:44:15,755
She makes me laugh...

380
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:19,433
she makes me cry...

381
00:44:19,770 --> 00:44:24,434
she torments me so much

382
00:45:02,146 --> 00:45:05,138
Sweetheart, beloved...

383
00:45:05,483 --> 00:45:09,476
you are the one
I have loved

384
00:45:10,821 --> 00:45:13,654
Restlessness grips my heart...

385
00:45:13,824 --> 00:45:17,316
what ache have you
given to my heart?

386
00:45:18,662 --> 00:45:23,998
You are the one I have loved

387
00:45:30,041 --> 00:45:34,000
You have stolen my heart

388
00:45:58,636 --> 00:46:03,198
The glance you cast,
robbed me of my peace...

389
00:46:04,375 --> 00:46:08,869
your dreams
kept me awake all nights

390
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:14,715
A thirst for you
lingers on my lips...

391
00:46:15,486 --> 00:46:20,389
what love is all about,
you have shown me

392
00:46:21,225 --> 00:46:25,059
You have stolen my heart

393
00:47:18,282 --> 00:47:20,944
My feet no longer
tread the ground...

394
00:47:21,118 --> 00:47:24,952
I've begun to fly

395
00:47:26,624 --> 00:47:33,120
Like fragrance, your tresses
are spread in the air

396
00:47:34,465 --> 00:47:39,630
What spell have you cast?

397
00:47:45,643 --> 00:47:50,137
You have stolen my heart

398
00:47:57,388 --> 00:48:01,654
You have stolen my heart

399
00:48:37,194 --> 00:48:44,032
In your arms,
I must live and die

400
00:48:45,703 --> 00:48:52,700
I have decided. You are the one
I will love without reservations

401
00:48:53,811 --> 00:48:58,874
You are the one I have
taken as my beloved

402
00:49:05,055 --> 00:49:09,389
You have stolen my heart

403
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:20,734
You have stolen my heart

404
00:49:29,246 --> 00:49:32,238
You're going away now.
- Stop me, if you can

405
00:49:32,416 --> 00:49:34,407
As if you'd stay back
if I asked you to

406
00:49:35,586 --> 00:49:37,577
I could even lay down my life,
if you asked me to

407
00:49:37,755 --> 00:49:39,086
Stop fibbing

408
00:49:39,923 --> 00:49:44,917
But I feel like talking with you.
All day, night, evening and noon

409
00:49:45,763 --> 00:49:48,755
Just talking.
- So go on

410
00:49:49,266 --> 00:49:55,102
Your deep voice...
it does something to my heart

411
00:49:57,541 --> 00:50:01,602
So I'll keep talking. All my life.
So much that you'll be fed up

412
00:50:01,779 --> 00:50:03,770
You will call me from Mumbai,
won't you?

413
00:50:04,782 --> 00:50:06,773
Are you going to think of me?

414
00:50:07,785 --> 00:50:10,276
You're the only girl
I can never stop thinking about

415
00:50:10,788 --> 00:50:12,779
The moment I've wrapped up
daddy's business...

416
00:50:12,890 --> 00:50:14,949
I'll fly into your arms
from Mauritius

417
00:50:23,634 --> 00:50:25,625
I'm glad you went away
to Mauritius

418
00:50:25,803 --> 00:50:27,794
There's no tension
with the police anymore

419
00:50:28,138 --> 00:50:30,800
Everything's under control.
- Let's talk business

420
00:50:30,908 --> 00:50:34,139
Podar Seth's company has closed down.
- What happened?

421
00:50:35,145 --> 00:50:37,136
That which is happening everywhere

422
00:50:38,148 --> 00:50:41,811
From Bikaner's bhujia
to Dehradun's basmati rice...

423
00:50:42,152 --> 00:50:44,143
from potato chips to the
computer chips...

424
00:50:45,489 --> 00:50:48,322
multinationals are storming
into every trade

425
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:52,822
Why're you playing a socialist?
What do you want me to do?

426
00:50:53,330 --> 00:50:57,664
I'll explain.
Peter, switch off the music

427
00:51:00,904 --> 00:51:04,840
Podar Seth needs a new formula of a
medical drug to start another company

428
00:51:05,175 --> 00:51:07,837
We've got to steal that formula
from a multinational company

429
00:51:08,445 --> 00:51:10,504
Why wait for me to pull off
something so easy?

430
00:51:10,848 --> 00:51:13,840
You could've done it on your own.
- We couldn't have

431
00:51:16,019 --> 00:51:19,682
This company has a very advanced
security system. Ultra-modern

432
00:51:24,528 --> 00:51:26,519
The alarm will go off
the moment we pick up the floppy

433
00:51:26,697 --> 00:51:28,688
The police will take 2 minutes
to get there...

434
00:51:29,366 --> 00:51:31,698
but the security guards
will be there in 10 seconds

435
00:51:32,369 --> 00:51:36,203
Only you can steal that floppy
and escape in 10 seconds

436
00:51:37,708 --> 00:51:40,370
The money?
- We've taken an advance

437
00:51:40,878 --> 00:51:43,369
We'll get the rest later.
- The most important thing...

438
00:51:44,882 --> 00:51:48,045
you can't enter the company's
records room through the door

439
00:51:48,886 --> 00:51:50,717
You'll have to get in
through the roof

440
00:51:52,389 --> 00:51:55,552
Suppose this is the records room
and the safe is here...

441
00:51:56,226 --> 00:51:59,389
from a height of 150 feet,
you will descend here

442
00:51:59,897 --> 00:52:04,231
The problem is: Laser beam traps
are laid all over the floor

443
00:52:05,235 --> 00:52:09,228
They aren't visible, but the moment
you touch them, the alarm will go off

444
00:52:09,740 --> 00:52:11,901
But these laser-beams can be
seen through a smokescreen

445
00:54:51,568 --> 00:54:53,900
She makes me laugh,
she makes me cry...

446
00:54:54,404 --> 00:54:56,395
she torments me so much

447
00:54:58,742 --> 00:55:00,733
I miss that girl very much

448
00:55:01,912 --> 00:55:06,906
Say something... don't be quiet.
Just keep talking

449
00:55:08,251 --> 00:55:09,582
Your voice...

450
00:55:10,587 --> 00:55:13,078
Forget about my voice
and heed my heart

451
00:55:17,427 --> 00:55:19,088
I'll come back soon

452
00:56:10,147 --> 00:56:12,980
She makes me laugh...

453
00:56:13,150 --> 00:56:15,482
she makes me cry...

454
00:56:15,819 --> 00:56:20,153
she torments me so much

455
00:56:32,903 --> 00:56:37,840
I miss that girl very much

456
00:57:00,530 --> 00:57:02,862
He appears in my dreams...

457
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:06,033
he steals my heart...

458
00:57:06,203 --> 00:57:10,196
he torments me so much

459
00:57:12,142 --> 00:57:17,205
I miss that boy very much

460
00:57:54,417 --> 00:57:59,411
The first time I saw her,
I went crazy about her'

461
00:58:00,023 --> 00:58:04,926
She acknowledged my love
and robbed me of my peace

462
00:58:07,931 --> 00:58:10,593
He's the one I could die for...

463
00:58:10,767 --> 00:58:13,258
I'm not afraid of the world

464
00:58:13,603 --> 00:58:18,939
it's his name I always chant,
as I sigh wistfully

465
00:58:19,276 --> 00:58:24,612
What helplessness is this?
Our love is yet unrequited

466
00:58:24,881 --> 00:58:27,281
This distance shall be
only for a few days...

467
00:58:27,617 --> 00:58:30,279
unite then, we must

468
00:58:30,787 --> 00:58:34,951
He awakens the ache
in my heart

469
00:58:36,059 --> 00:58:40,621
I miss that boy very much

470
00:58:57,814 --> 00:59:03,150
She makes me laugh...
she makes me cry...

471
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:07,313
she torments me so much

472
00:59:08,992 --> 00:59:11,654
He appears in my dreams...

473
00:59:11,828 --> 00:59:14,490
he steals my heart...

474
00:59:14,664 --> 00:59:19,328
he torments me so much

475
00:59:20,337 --> 00:59:25,673
I miss that boy very much

476
00:59:31,681 --> 00:59:36,675
I miss that girl very much

477
01:00:04,547 --> 01:00:07,880
I still can't believe it
that you have returned

478
01:00:09,052 --> 01:00:11,384
Liar! You didn't come to the
airport to receive me

479
01:00:11,721 --> 01:00:14,212
Your daddy was coming there.
- So what?

480
01:00:14,724 --> 01:00:17,386
You could've met him too.
- In his presence...

481
01:00:17,727 --> 01:00:22,391
could I have touched you like this?
- Strange guy, Ali!

482
01:00:24,401 --> 01:00:27,063
You guys... here?
- For a cup of coffee, what else?

483
01:00:31,408 --> 01:00:33,399
We're good friends of Rachait

484
01:00:36,079 --> 01:00:38,070
Rachait, I must leave

485
01:00:38,581 --> 01:00:41,414
Don't you like our company?
- It's nothing of the sort

486
01:00:47,257 --> 01:00:49,088
Well...? Love?

487
01:00:49,159 --> 01:00:51,252
You didn't give us a proper
introduction to your girlfriend

488
01:00:52,429 --> 01:00:54,920
We'd have said a few words
in praise of you

489
01:00:56,933 --> 01:00:58,924
You've given that girl
the status of art!

490
01:00:59,436 --> 01:01:01,768
Looks like you haven't told her
what you do for a living

491
01:01:01,938 --> 01:01:05,430
Every time I told a girl,
she fled!

492
01:01:08,778 --> 01:01:13,374
Love makes people talk.
And you've fallen silent

493
01:01:13,850 --> 01:01:15,579
Let's talk business

494
01:01:17,988 --> 01:01:20,786
it's going to be very crowded there,
there will be a lot of security men

495
01:01:22,459 --> 01:01:24,791
And the party's being held
on the 20th floor

496
01:01:24,894 --> 01:01:27,795
it's impossible for us
to escape from there

497
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:32,791
What's gotten into you?

498
01:01:33,870 --> 01:01:36,964
I'm not in the mood.
- Where are you going?

499
01:01:37,307 --> 01:01:40,299
Moods don't run the business.
- I'm not in the mood, I told you

500
01:01:40,810 --> 01:01:42,801
I don't want to do it.
- Relax, Ali

501
01:01:43,813 --> 01:01:45,804
Let's talk about it later

502
01:01:49,819 --> 01:01:52,151
Something surely is fishy.
- Isn't there?

503
01:01:54,224 --> 01:01:55,714
It's his girlfriend

504
01:01:55,859 --> 01:01:58,828
You're through with talking, Rachait?

505
01:01:59,829 --> 01:02:03,230
And you said you could
go on all your life

506
01:02:03,833 --> 01:02:06,165
Well, Mr Silent...?
What's up?

507
01:02:09,005 --> 01:02:13,169
Sapna, I carry a burden
on my heart

508
01:02:14,010 --> 01:02:18,242
So give it to me.
Your burden and your sorrows

509
01:02:32,862 --> 01:02:34,853
I am a criminal

510
01:02:36,366 --> 01:02:39,858
Ever since I was a child,
I have been a thief

511
01:02:46,876 --> 01:02:52,371
But I'm not using my poverty
and helplessness as an excuse

512
01:02:54,284 --> 01:02:56,275
I'm just a thief

513
01:02:58,888 --> 01:03:01,880
Maybe you've become quiet
because you hear me say this

514
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:06,895
Maybe you'll go far away from me
in just a moment or two

515
01:03:08,064 --> 01:03:13,331
I'm afraid to turn around and see.
Even if you have walked away...

516
01:03:13,903 --> 01:03:20,308
I won't hold you guilty.
But if you're still with me...

517
01:03:21,578 --> 01:03:26,914
I promise, I will give up
everything. Everything.

518
01:03:35,925 --> 01:03:37,187
Promise?

519
01:03:47,003 --> 01:03:50,598
I've made up my mind.
I'm giving up all this

520
01:03:51,941 --> 01:03:56,935
Is that your decision...?
Or is it hers?

521
01:04:03,953 --> 01:04:06,945
If you're in love, get married.
That's a nice thing

522
01:04:07,290 --> 01:04:10,691
We'll dance at your wedding.
But there's a problem

523
01:04:11,261 --> 01:04:14,594
if one of us commits the theft,
he won't be able to escape

524
01:04:15,064 --> 01:04:20,559
He'll get caught. And if he tattles
on the names of anyone of us...

525
01:04:20,970 --> 01:04:22,961
the police could come
to your house too

526
01:04:23,139 --> 01:04:25,130
Your family will be ruined
before it's made

527
01:04:25,408 --> 01:04:28,172
That's just what we don't want!
- Now look...

528
01:04:28,344 --> 01:04:33,407
the necklace is worth 50 million.
Do it one last time

529
01:04:34,150 --> 01:04:36,983
Once we have the money,
we'll give up this profession too

530
01:04:38,254 --> 01:04:40,518
We'll also get married

531
01:04:48,998 --> 01:04:51,990
The last time...?
- Of course. The last time!

532
01:04:59,742 --> 01:05:03,007
I'm glad he agreed.
- Have you told him...

533
01:05:03,346 --> 01:05:06,110
the necklace has a computer chip
with the army's secrets in it?

534
01:05:06,449 --> 01:05:08,440
As is he'd have agreed then!

535
01:05:08,952 --> 01:05:13,582
Before the chip is delivered to
anyone else, it'll fall in our hands

536
01:05:14,724 --> 01:05:18,626
And we'll sell it to the ISI
at any price we wish

537
01:05:19,028 --> 01:05:22,020
But the goose that lays the golden eggs
is slipping out of our hands

538
01:05:23,099 --> 01:05:27,035
it won't.
- Sapna will not be true for him

539
01:05:45,121 --> 01:05:47,112
You have a beautiful necklace

540
01:05:49,058 --> 01:05:52,050
What business are you into?
- I run a diamond business

541
01:06:09,579 --> 01:06:12,810
By the way, I don't dance
with just about anyone

542
01:06:57,460 --> 01:07:00,452
In which case, you will remember
me for a long time to come

543
01:07:02,131 --> 01:07:04,929
People think of me
after I'm gone away

544
01:07:14,143 --> 01:07:16,543
Out with the necklace

545
01:07:17,180 --> 01:07:19,512
Out with the necklace

546
01:07:29,926 --> 01:07:33,157
You wanted to give the ISI classified
information about the Indian army!

547
01:07:35,164 --> 01:07:37,359
Bring these three guys along.
Move it

548
01:08:44,233 --> 01:08:48,567
Why do your friends Ali and Abbas
want to kill me?

549
01:09:02,251 --> 01:09:04,583
Take the body to the hospital

550
01:09:06,255 --> 01:09:09,588
Have him charged under TADA and locked
away in the Elphinston Jail forever

551
01:09:10,593 --> 01:09:12,584
He'll rot in exile

552
01:09:15,064 --> 01:09:19,433
We have another request. Our names
mustn't be dragged into this case

553
01:09:32,281 --> 01:09:35,546
This is the Elphinston Jail

554
01:09:36,285 --> 01:09:39,948
In the last 150 years, not one prisoner
has been able to run away from here

555
01:09:43,693 --> 01:09:49,427
I see a rebellion in your eyes.
But your lips are sealed

556
01:09:53,402 --> 01:09:56,303
Maybe the onslaught of time
has turned you dumb

557
01:09:56,639 --> 01:10:02,305
And we have now clipped your wings.
Don't ever try to escape from here

558
01:10:02,979 --> 01:10:05,641
You'll either drop dead
on the ground...

559
01:10:05,882 --> 01:10:08,874
or drown in the sea.
Understand?

560
01:10:23,866 --> 01:10:26,664
He ran away!
In just 2 months

561
01:10:28,437 --> 01:10:30,667
I know where he must've gone

562
01:12:10,773 --> 01:12:14,436
Forgive me, although we
don't know each other...

563
01:12:14,844 --> 01:12:18,439
I do know of the love
that lies hidden in your heart

564
01:12:21,450 --> 01:12:22,712
For Rachait

565
01:12:24,920 --> 01:12:28,447
I think of the immense love
he must've had for you...

566
01:12:28,791 --> 01:12:30,691
to lose his balance of mind

567
01:12:30,893 --> 01:12:33,555
I don't want to listen
to anything about him

568
01:12:33,863 --> 01:12:35,728
You may leave

569
01:12:35,931 --> 01:12:38,399
I have nothing to do with people
who break their promises

570
01:12:40,970 --> 01:12:44,804
Please don't say that.
I need your help

571
01:12:45,274 --> 01:12:48,209
I don't meet anyone.
- I know...

572
01:12:48,644 --> 01:12:51,477
you're dead, as far as
the world is concerned

573
01:12:51,814 --> 01:12:54,806
Because you're from the CBI,
I was compelled to...

574
01:12:55,151 --> 01:12:59,144
That's exactly why
you must go to Rachait with me

575
01:13:02,491 --> 01:13:03,480
No

576
01:13:05,594 --> 01:13:07,357
He won't turn you down

577
01:13:07,530 --> 01:13:09,794
And we desperately need him
in this mission

578
01:13:09,999 --> 01:13:13,298
I'm dead for him!
- But he's dying every moment...

579
01:13:13,502 --> 01:13:16,027
with your memories.
- So tell him...

580
01:13:16,138 --> 01:13:21,235
to light a pyre of the memories.
- Even the smoke from the pyre...

581
01:13:21,510 --> 01:13:24,308
will be that of your love.
Come with me just once

582
01:13:24,747 --> 01:13:29,116
Let him see that you're alive.
He'll come back to life...

583
01:13:29,518 --> 01:13:34,512
and our mission will be successful.
- Sorry, I can't help you

584
01:13:35,825 --> 01:13:39,522
I implore you in the name of
someone you must ever have loved

585
01:13:39,929 --> 01:13:42,693
You will never tell him
that I'm alive

586
01:13:44,567 --> 01:13:47,536
Did you have to implore me
in someone's name...?

587
01:13:50,806 --> 01:13:55,266
Although she's no more...
my love for her is still alive

588
01:13:56,545 --> 01:14:00,208
And here, although she's alive...

589
01:14:00,549 --> 01:14:04,542
the poor man thinks
his beloved is dead

590
01:14:14,463 --> 01:14:16,556
Why're you wasting your time
over such a man?

591
01:14:16,966 --> 01:14:19,230
He's lost to himself.
What use will you have for him?

592
01:14:19,435 --> 01:14:23,371
I want to take a chance, jailer.
- Why take a chance for a man...

593
01:14:23,639 --> 01:14:26,574
who's alive just by chance?
- What does that mean?

594
01:14:28,611 --> 01:14:33,173
Every 12 hours, the man drops dead.
- Dead?

595
01:14:34,650 --> 01:14:37,949
Yes, every 12 hours, he suffers a fit

596
01:14:39,021 --> 01:14:43,583
He sees only shadows
everywhere

597
01:14:44,660 --> 01:14:46,924
He then runs after them

598
01:14:47,396 --> 01:14:49,921
He assaults anyone
who comes before him

599
01:14:50,599 --> 01:14:55,593
Out of control some times,
he bangs his head against the wall

600
01:15:04,213 --> 01:15:07,842
So how do you bring him under control?
- With tranquillisers

601
01:15:16,992 --> 01:15:20,428
Although these tranquillisers
affect his memory

602
01:15:20,796 --> 01:15:23,356
But he calms down instantly

603
01:15:23,966 --> 01:15:26,867
What happens when the effect of
the tranquilliser has worn off?

604
01:15:28,304 --> 01:15:31,637
I didn't give him a dose, because
you wanted to question him

605
01:15:48,657 --> 01:15:50,648
Set him free

606
01:15:59,068 --> 01:16:00,660
Please leave

607
01:16:04,273 --> 01:16:06,935
Everyone here thinks
you're good for nothing

608
01:16:09,545 --> 01:16:12,207
But I think you can be
of great use to me

609
01:16:14,683 --> 01:16:17,083
I'm Akram Shaikh.
From the CBI

610
01:16:19,688 --> 01:16:22,282
Your name is Rachait, isn't it?

611
01:16:23,759 --> 01:16:28,025
You have two objectives in life.
Both of them...

612
01:16:28,797 --> 01:16:31,459
cannot be accomplished
unless you're out of prison

613
01:16:33,068 --> 01:16:36,060
I can help you in
getting out of jail

614
01:16:37,339 --> 01:16:42,868
if you help me... to save
the nation from a crisis

615
01:16:44,179 --> 01:16:47,171
The Elphinston Jail...
does that ring a bell?

616
01:16:49,985 --> 01:16:54,718
It's now a tourist spot.
But when it was a prison...

617
01:16:55,791 --> 01:16:59,056
no inmate could ever
run away from it

618
01:16:59,828 --> 01:17:03,730
Except one man.
You

619
01:17:06,168 --> 01:17:10,161
In the waters under the jail, is a
maze of tunnels leading to the shores

620
01:17:11,140 --> 01:17:13,734
Only you know about them

621
01:17:14,743 --> 01:17:17,337
You were the one who
ran away from there

622
01:17:17,746 --> 01:17:20,738
I want to use the same tunnel
to get inside the jail

623
01:17:21,750 --> 01:17:24,412
You will go with me,
because...

624
01:17:24,753 --> 01:17:27,654
you will fulfil an objective
if you leave with me

625
01:17:29,091 --> 01:17:32,549
Two men are holding 213 people
hostages in the prison

626
01:17:34,096 --> 01:17:41,901
The two men are your friends.
The brothers... Abbas and Ali

627
01:17:48,911 --> 01:17:53,439
They've placed all the seven lakes in
Mumbai in target of a deadly virus

628
01:17:54,783 --> 01:17:58,776
if their demands are not met,
along with Mumbai...

629
01:17:59,288 --> 01:18:05,124
they'll destroy the entire nation.
I know, it'll make no difference to you

630
01:18:06,228 --> 01:18:09,220
But if your enemies slip out
of our hands this time...

631
01:18:09,798 --> 01:18:12,790
they'll have gone very far away
from your reach

632
01:18:13,802 --> 01:18:16,794
You'll never find a better
opportunity of confronting them

633
01:18:18,207 --> 01:18:22,143
Come with me and have your revenge

634
01:18:34,823 --> 01:18:36,450
I forgot...

635
01:18:37,126 --> 01:18:41,460
your second objective.
Your love

636
01:18:47,836 --> 01:18:50,168
Love never dies, they say

637
01:18:50,539 --> 01:18:55,841
And the way you loved her,
only someone in love can understand

638
01:18:57,846 --> 01:19:00,508
She left you and went away
to a world of her own

639
01:19:01,750 --> 01:19:06,244
But whichever world she lives in,
you will meet her some day

640
01:19:06,889 --> 01:19:08,857
And what will you say to her?

641
01:19:08,957 --> 01:19:11,221
That you were a criminal
who served a sentence?

642
01:19:11,493 --> 01:19:15,224
Won't you do something that will
make you rise in her esteem?

643
01:19:15,864 --> 01:19:22,167
So that she can say, no one has
ever loved the way you have

644
01:19:26,942 --> 01:19:29,877
if you can fight a battle
because you hate someone...

645
01:19:30,879 --> 01:19:33,575
you can fight it because
you loved someone too

646
01:19:34,249 --> 01:19:37,241
Or maybe for the millions
who live in Mumbai

647
01:19:48,950 --> 01:19:51,180
No one can snatch
that right from us!

648
01:19:51,352 --> 01:19:53,377
We were born in a free nation...

649
01:19:55,256 --> 01:19:57,247
Hey little girl...

650
01:19:57,592 --> 01:20:01,392
you talk as if the mutiny
of 1857 has begun again

651
01:20:01,663 --> 01:20:05,759
You're in the habit of talking
about the mutiny of 1857...

652
01:20:06,034 --> 01:20:09,595
and the struggle of 1942, aren't you?
- I'm your guide, after all

653
01:20:11,272 --> 01:20:13,604
You can't hold us back by force!

654
01:20:14,042 --> 01:20:17,603
I love fighting girls.
What is your name?

655
01:20:19,480 --> 01:20:21,607
Congratulations!
You have just won your freedom!

656
01:20:21,783 --> 01:20:23,614
Guards, open the door

657
01:20:23,818 --> 01:20:25,615
Welcome

658
01:20:27,288 --> 01:20:30,621
You've won freedom only from them.
Not from me

659
01:20:39,067 --> 01:20:42,434
This one's been instigating everyone.
I suggest, you keep her separately

660
01:20:44,706 --> 01:20:47,334
Lock her up in the old wing
of the jail

661
01:20:47,809 --> 01:20:49,800
Who else wants freedom?

662
01:20:57,652 --> 01:20:59,552
Hey C.M...
- Who's this?

663
01:20:59,721 --> 01:21:02,053
Your father!
- Watch your language!

664
01:21:02,657 --> 01:21:04,386
Watch your manners

665
01:21:04,659 --> 01:21:07,321
This is your mother speaking, son

666
01:21:10,698 --> 01:21:12,666
Call me a genius

667
01:21:13,101 --> 01:21:15,831
Haven't we turned the heat
on the whole of Mumbai?

668
01:21:16,671 --> 01:21:19,265
You remember the demands,
don't you?

669
01:21:20,975 --> 01:21:22,966
Ali, you talk to him

670
01:21:26,681 --> 01:21:28,444
You remember the demands?

671
01:21:29,083 --> 01:21:33,019
150 billion and a ship to leave

672
01:21:33,421 --> 01:21:36,288
But who's going to give you asylum?
- There's just one nation...

673
01:21:36,424 --> 01:21:38,688
which gives asylum to
the criminals of India

674
01:21:40,895 --> 01:21:43,056
You have 20 hours to go

675
01:21:45,700 --> 01:21:47,099
Get in!

676
01:21:51,306 --> 01:21:56,141
The walls in this cell are very weak.
Scream, and they'll collapse on you

677
01:22:10,525 --> 01:22:12,516
You look handsome

678
01:22:13,728 --> 01:22:17,721
Time turns you into a savage,
Time turns you human

679
01:22:20,802 --> 01:22:24,067
We're all slaves to Time.
Because Time is all powerful

680
01:22:25,540 --> 01:22:29,533
Your face has changed today,
your clothes will change soon...

681
01:22:30,011 --> 01:22:32,411
maybe your Times will change too

682
01:22:44,459 --> 01:22:49,192
Never have faith...

683
01:22:50,131 --> 01:22:55,091
never wait

684
01:22:56,304 --> 01:23:01,765
Don't ever have
boundless love for anyone

685
01:23:02,276 --> 01:23:07,270
Don't ever have
boundless love for anyone

686
01:23:26,234 --> 01:23:31,365
Someone is faithful,
someone is unfaithful...

687
01:23:31,973 --> 01:23:37,172
who knows what misdemeanour
they commit

688
01:23:37,912 --> 01:23:43,407
In love, I have been
heart-broken...

689
01:23:43,751 --> 01:23:49,087
I have been deserted half way
through the journey

690
01:23:51,826 --> 01:23:56,820
Don't ever express it...

691
01:23:57,598 --> 01:24:02,831
don't ever wait for him

692
01:24:04,105 --> 01:24:08,838
Don't ever have
boundless love for anyone

693
01:24:09,977 --> 01:24:14,846
Don't ever have
boundless love for anyone

694
01:24:17,885 --> 01:24:21,218
My suspicion was right, sir.
The ISI has hatched this conspiracy

695
01:24:21,722 --> 01:24:23,849
I've received a report from RAW too

696
01:24:24,158 --> 01:24:26,854
ISI's Brigadier Rashid
is behind all this

697
01:24:27,161 --> 01:24:29,857
He's the one who tried the virus
on a few of our prisoners

698
01:24:30,231 --> 01:24:32,665
But our forces will give
him a fitting reply

699
01:24:33,234 --> 01:24:36,101
Go ahead and accomplish
your mission

700
01:24:37,872 --> 01:24:39,863
Hail India, sir.
- Hail India

701
01:24:44,879 --> 01:24:47,439
Akram, this is Brigadier Rashid
calling from Pakistan

702
01:24:51,886 --> 01:24:53,877
Quickly say what you've got to

703
01:24:54,889 --> 01:25:00,054
Let Mumbai go to the dogs.
You needn't worry about your job

704
01:25:01,229 --> 01:25:04,062
As soon as Kashmir is freed,
we'll appoint you the I.G. there

705
01:25:05,566 --> 01:25:08,228
Allah-willing, Kashmir
will soon be ours

706
01:25:08,503 --> 01:25:11,165
Hey Rashid, stop dreaming

707
01:25:11,973 --> 01:25:14,908
You've been fighting for Kashmir
for the last 55 years...

708
01:25:15,176 --> 01:25:18,270
has Allah ever helped you?
No

709
01:25:18,946 --> 01:25:24,282
You know why? Because even Allah
wants Kashmir to be part of India

710
01:25:25,219 --> 01:25:29,053
if not to us, listen to at least
the will of Allah

711
01:25:29,390 --> 01:25:33,258
Because of Allah I have telephoned
to help a Muslim brother of mine

712
01:25:33,694 --> 01:25:36,629
Why? Are there no Muslims
in Pakistan anymore?

713
01:25:37,031 --> 01:25:42,936
Help them, Rashid miyan. And if you
think Pakistani's are not Muslims...

714
01:25:43,404 --> 01:25:45,531
it's a very sad comment

715
01:25:45,940 --> 01:25:49,740
But if they are and you
still want to help us here...

716
01:25:50,077 --> 01:25:53,308
people in your country will
call you a traitor, Rashid Miyan

717
01:25:53,581 --> 01:25:58,211
Not me! it's people of your country
that call you Muslims traitors!

718
01:25:58,486 --> 01:26:00,750
Oh yes, there are
some people here...

719
01:26:01,022 --> 01:26:03,616
who lecture us on patriotism
every now and then

720
01:26:03,958 --> 01:26:07,450
Like you lecture us
on Islam all the time

721
01:26:08,229 --> 01:26:10,959
Now look, Brigadier.
My religion is Islam

722
01:26:11,966 --> 01:26:15,766
But my motherland is Hindustan.
And thus I salute Mother India...

723
01:26:16,103 --> 01:26:19,561
the one you want to bleed.
Stop doing it

724
01:26:19,974 --> 01:26:23,307
Else, we'll teach you a lesson
the world will be left watching

725
01:26:23,644 --> 01:26:25,544
We'll finish you for good

726
01:26:32,119 --> 01:26:35,782
At Sunset, we'll reach the prison.
With high tide...

727
01:26:35,990 --> 01:26:38,652
we'll gain entry into the prison
through the secret tunnels

728
01:26:38,793 --> 01:26:41,261
With me will be this
special force of commandos

729
01:26:41,429 --> 01:26:44,660
And also Rahul Gupta,
scientist of CDC

730
01:26:45,066 --> 01:26:48,001
He will tell us about the virus
that is loaded in the missile

731
01:26:58,179 --> 01:27:02,673
However close you get to the missile,
whatever the emergency...

732
01:27:03,084 --> 01:27:06,019
do not even try to separate
the virus from the missile

733
01:27:06,354 --> 01:27:09,619
Which is why I'm going to with you.
And remember...

734
01:27:10,024 --> 01:27:12,686
the slightest bit of
carelessness on our part...

735
01:27:13,027 --> 01:27:17,191
could make the entire mission fail.
It could affect the whole country

736
01:27:18,032 --> 01:27:20,364
This virus is very dangerous

737
01:27:27,708 --> 01:27:31,701
The moment the mission is
accomplished, one of you...

738
01:27:32,046 --> 01:27:35,038
will have to light smoke-sticks
to signal us

739
01:27:41,088 --> 01:27:46,048
Akram, can Rachait recall something?
- He will, sir

740
01:27:47,061 --> 01:27:49,529
The moment he sees the model,
it'll all come back to him

741
01:28:13,087 --> 01:28:16,079
This is the jail
you were held captive at

742
01:28:27,335 --> 01:28:29,826
Try and recall how
you escaped from there

743
01:28:50,124 --> 01:28:52,456
Remember something?

744
01:28:58,866 --> 01:29:01,130
Officer, here are
Rachait's medicines

745
01:29:01,435 --> 01:29:03,835
if he has another fit,
give him these medicines

746
01:29:04,205 --> 01:29:06,537
He will calm down immediately

747
01:29:11,545 --> 01:29:13,137
Sapna, this is Akram

748
01:29:13,481 --> 01:29:19,147
You didn't go with me to meet Rachait.
But I still want to thank you

749
01:29:19,754 --> 01:29:22,587
You haven't told Rachait
that I'm alive, have you?

750
01:29:22,923 --> 01:29:27,155
No, he still doesn't know
that you're alive

751
01:29:32,032 --> 01:29:36,162
This mission is so dangerous,
there's no saying...

752
01:29:36,504 --> 01:29:38,699
whether he will even return alive

753
01:29:44,044 --> 01:29:47,912
Rachait did not betray you,
he gave you only love

754
01:29:48,849 --> 01:29:54,185
Because of that very love, he forget
the way to live... the way to speak

755
01:29:54,989 --> 01:29:56,320
Hail India

756
01:30:12,440 --> 01:30:14,931
I have influence in the Prime
Minister's office, my child

757
01:30:21,449 --> 01:30:25,579
You guys have played a very big game.
Now listen carefully

758
01:30:26,487 --> 01:30:34,223
Bad news. Akram Shaikh, with 10
commandos, is coming to attack you

759
01:30:35,229 --> 01:30:41,828
And there's good news too.
Your old friend, philosopher...

760
01:30:42,236 --> 01:30:45,535
is coming to you to be your friend
for a lifetime

761
01:30:46,307 --> 01:30:48,036
Your guide

762
01:30:50,244 --> 01:30:51,836
Be careful

763
01:30:58,252 --> 01:31:02,586
Our old friend Rachait is coming.
To fight against us

764
01:31:03,324 --> 01:31:04,586
Really?

765
01:31:07,995 --> 01:31:11,260
In that case, we must welcome him

766
01:31:12,266 --> 01:31:15,258
isn't it the Rachait you guys
often talk about?

767
01:31:16,537 --> 01:31:20,268
Before you finish him,
do let me take a look at him

768
01:31:21,275 --> 01:31:24,267
No, no, no!

769
01:31:26,280 --> 01:31:29,272
Why not?
- Because he's a lover

770
01:31:29,683 --> 01:31:32,675
What if you fall in love with him?

771
01:31:33,287 --> 01:31:36,279
The two of us will be ruined

772
01:31:36,991 --> 01:31:40,392
So we'll first kill him
and then show you

773
01:31:47,301 --> 01:31:50,759
The helicopter has dropped
the commando force...

774
01:31:51,005 --> 01:31:53,303
about 3 kilometers away
from the jail

775
01:31:54,375 --> 01:31:57,970
They're now moving
towards the secret tunnels

776
01:33:02,443 --> 01:33:06,379
Sir, our commandos have got into
he Elphinston Jail

777
01:33:30,704 --> 01:33:32,831
The jail was made and
destroyed several times

778
01:33:33,073 --> 01:33:35,940
I don't know which map
ought to be followed

779
01:33:37,411 --> 01:33:42,075
Rachait can help us only if
he remembers something

780
01:33:42,483 --> 01:33:45,418
Sir, our commandos have got into
the tunnel to the jail

781
01:33:46,854 --> 01:33:49,846
The cameras are switched on.
You can take a look

782
01:35:21,915 --> 01:35:24,509
Can you see something?

783
01:35:29,323 --> 01:35:31,791
Careful, sir.
There's a motion-sensor there

784
01:35:58,552 --> 01:36:00,543
They've left the tunnel

785
01:36:01,255 --> 01:36:04,554
Stay here, Rahul.
And take care of Rachait

786
01:37:57,771 --> 01:37:59,762
Moron! Your government
sent you here...

787
01:37:59,840 --> 01:38:02,331
and you came along chanting
Hail India!

788
01:38:03,677 --> 01:38:06,475
When we set chanting out
Hail India...

789
01:38:06,680 --> 01:38:11,083
we only return victorious.
- Not from here

790
01:38:11,585 --> 01:38:14,179
You'll get killed!
- If we die...

791
01:38:14,688 --> 01:38:18,681
scores of others will stand up.
If they are killed...

792
01:38:19,092 --> 01:38:21,083
millions of others
will rise against you

793
01:38:21,361 --> 01:38:23,352
He's talking too much!
- Make a sieve out of him!

794
01:38:25,332 --> 01:38:28,426
Akram Shaikh, your death is
destined at our hands!

795
01:38:28,902 --> 01:38:32,702
And your death is also destined
at someone's hands

796
01:38:33,307 --> 01:38:37,038
Not me, but the
One Above knows who

797
01:38:37,644 --> 01:38:40,408
We're the ones above!
Can't you see that?

798
01:38:40,814 --> 01:38:43,248
Now beg for your life!

799
01:38:43,517 --> 01:38:45,348
He's down on his knees anyway!

800
01:39:23,223 --> 01:39:27,091
Looks like they were told beforehand
about our commandos' attack

801
01:39:27,527 --> 01:39:30,189
Sir, we've got signals
from the second camera

802
01:39:34,768 --> 01:39:37,566
He's still suffering.
- So let him suffer

803
01:39:37,904 --> 01:39:41,772
Are you guys thinking of
shooting him? Here goes

804
01:40:03,797 --> 01:40:07,790
Do what you will.
You can't run away from here

805
01:40:08,402 --> 01:40:10,802
We're not running away.
We're leaving...

806
01:40:10,971 --> 01:40:13,496
in a ship of your government,
like their sons-in-law

807
01:40:15,675 --> 01:40:18,803
Don't you know
where we're going?

808
01:40:19,813 --> 01:40:23,476
Very well too.
There's just one nation...

809
01:40:23,984 --> 01:40:31,356
where every terrorist from India
is hailed and welcomed

810
01:40:36,496 --> 01:40:38,293
You got it right!

811
01:40:41,001 --> 01:40:44,630
But that nation is a paradise
for Muslims like us!

812
01:40:45,005 --> 01:40:49,567
You're going to get kicked around
in that paradise you're going to

813
01:40:51,845 --> 01:40:56,248
Even in 1947, several people went
across in search of their paradise

814
01:40:57,517 --> 01:41:00,281
They were subjected to
a lot of humiliation

815
01:41:00,854 --> 01:41:02,788
That's what's going to
happen to you too

816
01:41:02,923 --> 01:41:08,452
Whatever happens to us over there,
we hate the infidels in this country!

817
01:41:14,868 --> 01:41:17,860
Not Hindus, not Muslims...

818
01:41:19,539 --> 01:41:23,202
this country has a problem
with traitors

819
01:42:10,457 --> 01:42:14,917
I haven't killed you yet
because you're a Muslim

820
01:42:17,364 --> 01:42:20,697
if you want to live,
talk to the C.M.

821
01:42:21,101 --> 01:42:23,365
And make him give us
the 150 billion

822
01:42:23,537 --> 01:42:29,533
I'll get you even 1500 billion.
On one condition

823
01:42:31,311 --> 01:42:35,941
Take all your friends with you,
whose faith is money...

824
01:42:36,616 --> 01:42:38,607
and betrayal, their profession

825
01:42:40,120 --> 01:42:43,954
Whatever faith or religion
they belong to

826
01:42:46,726 --> 01:42:48,956
He spoke so much!

827
01:42:53,667 --> 01:42:56,033
It's all over

828
01:43:11,384 --> 01:43:13,909
You're in a lot of pain,
aren't you?

829
01:43:51,024 --> 01:43:55,518
All I regret is that I'm
leaving a mission incomplete...

830
01:43:56,363 --> 01:43:59,025
for the first time in my life.
- Nothing will happen to you!

831
01:43:59,699 --> 01:44:02,031
Nothing!

832
01:44:04,537 --> 01:44:06,528
Looks like God has called me over

833
01:44:08,541 --> 01:44:12,375
From very far away...

834
01:44:14,714 --> 01:44:16,705
someone's calling me

835
01:44:18,051 --> 01:44:21,043
I'm coming, my love...
I'm coming

836
01:44:21,721 --> 01:44:25,555
No! Akram, we'll be able
to do nothing!

837
01:44:25,659 --> 01:44:31,222
No! Don't say such things.
Promise me...

838
01:44:33,733 --> 01:44:37,225
you will leave only after you
have done what we had set out to do

839
01:44:40,740 --> 01:44:42,731
They are not the ones
who will bring doomsday...

840
01:44:43,576 --> 01:44:45,737
we'll bring doom to them

841
01:44:57,424 --> 01:44:59,585
Hey C.M.
You sent commandos here!

842
01:44:59,693 --> 01:45:02,423
I... I sent them
to negotiate with you

843
01:45:02,595 --> 01:45:04,085
With guns in their hands?

844
01:45:04,264 --> 01:45:08,758
Their guns spoke, so did ours.
They're all dead-meat

845
01:45:09,602 --> 01:45:11,593
Now see what we're going to do!

846
01:45:25,385 --> 01:45:27,785
Rachait, they're going to kill us!
Get up!

847
01:45:28,788 --> 01:45:31,621
They've got guns!
We could lose our lives!

848
01:45:31,791 --> 01:45:34,783
Do you get what I'm saying, Rachait?

849
01:45:38,031 --> 01:45:40,124
I was crazy to come here
to defuse the missiles!

850
01:45:41,301 --> 01:45:44,134
I've had my fuse blown
and you won't say a word!

851
01:45:44,304 --> 01:45:46,465
Say something... react!

852
01:45:50,143 --> 01:45:53,135
They were here.
They've killed Akram Shaikh!

853
01:45:53,980 --> 01:45:57,143
The one who brought us here.
He's gone away...

854
01:45:58,685 --> 01:46:01,483
and left us here!
What am I going to do?

855
01:46:01,654 --> 01:46:06,990
Oh yes! You remember the way back!
We'll go back the way we came!

856
01:46:07,160 --> 01:46:09,651
I can't even remember
a normal route, Rachait

857
01:46:20,273 --> 01:46:24,175
I've burnt Rachait to death.
His ashes will now flow into the sea!

858
01:46:24,344 --> 01:46:27,336
Only his ashes will
escape from this jail!

859
01:46:30,850 --> 01:46:35,184
Sir, there's a girl called Sapna
who wants to meet you

860
01:46:35,355 --> 01:46:38,017
She says she has permission
from the P.M.'s office

861
01:46:38,191 --> 01:46:41,854
What am I to tell her, sir?
- Show her in

862
01:46:43,363 --> 01:46:46,855
There was a call from the PMO
that a girl wants to see me

863
01:46:47,033 --> 01:46:51,026
She's the lover of the prisoner Rachait
who has gone on the mission

864
01:47:08,221 --> 01:47:10,382
ls Rachait all right?

865
01:47:12,892 --> 01:47:16,726
Yes, we're trying to
establish contact

866
01:47:17,564 --> 01:47:20,624
What does that mean?
- At the moment...

867
01:47:20,733 --> 01:47:24,396
those who have gone on
the mission, are missing

868
01:48:01,608 --> 01:48:03,599
What are you looking for...?

869
01:48:06,946 --> 01:48:08,937
Looks like the effect of
the medicine is wearing off

870
01:48:10,783 --> 01:48:12,774
He's getting the fits again

871
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:03,662
Sir, the scientist Rahul Gupta is
right before Lt Pradip's camera

872
01:49:15,515 --> 01:49:18,348
Switch on the beep of the wireless!
Tap it, please!

873
01:49:32,031 --> 01:49:34,522
Who's this?
- Khurana. CBI chief

874
01:49:35,702 --> 01:49:40,036
Sir, how do you know that
I've got the wireless?

875
01:49:40,206 --> 01:49:42,538
The officer lying in front of you..
- He's dead, sir

876
01:49:44,043 --> 01:49:45,704
there's a camera fixed
on his shoulder...

877
01:49:45,979 --> 01:49:47,378
through which I can see you

878
01:49:47,547 --> 01:49:50,539
Remove the camera from his
shoulder and fix it on yours

879
01:49:57,390 --> 01:50:01,224
They've all been killed, sir.
Only Rachait and I are alive

880
01:50:03,229 --> 01:50:05,891
I know all the commandos
have been killed

881
01:50:07,066 --> 01:50:09,899
A traitor has leaked
information to them

882
01:50:21,581 --> 01:50:23,242
No, sir...

883
01:50:25,418 --> 01:50:27,750
The two of you can
complete the mission!

884
01:50:28,087 --> 01:50:30,078
Do not lose your nerve!

885
01:50:36,429 --> 01:50:37,919
There's someone standing
right in front of you!

886
01:50:44,604 --> 01:50:49,940
When death stares you in the face,
you have only two options

887
01:50:50,443 --> 01:50:52,604
Either surrender
or take him on

888
01:51:32,318 --> 01:51:34,479
Hurry up and get to Rachait

889
01:51:59,178 --> 01:52:01,169
Rachait! Get up!
Come to your senses!

890
01:52:06,519 --> 01:52:08,510
Only the two of us are left!

891
01:52:23,369 --> 01:52:25,701
It's very important for Rachait
to regain consciousness

892
01:52:26,205 --> 01:52:29,038
On him depends the success
of our entire mission

893
01:52:29,208 --> 01:52:32,041
But how are we going to sit here
and bring him back to his senses?

894
01:52:37,884 --> 01:52:40,546
Sir, I can help you

895
01:52:42,955 --> 01:52:45,947
I can have a word with Rachait

896
01:52:52,899 --> 01:52:54,890
Talk to him! Go on!

897
01:53:01,240 --> 01:53:02,229
Rachait...

898
01:53:06,913 --> 01:53:09,575
Rachait, this is Sapna

899
01:53:11,851 --> 01:53:13,842
Are you listening, Rachait?

900
01:53:16,923 --> 01:53:18,914
I'm alive, Rachait

901
01:53:21,027 --> 01:53:23,928
Nothing has happened to me, Rachait

902
01:53:24,197 --> 01:53:26,597
I'm here in the control-room.
Only for you

903
01:53:30,603 --> 01:53:32,594
Only for you, Rachait

904
01:53:33,272 --> 01:53:38,266
I went far away from you, didn't I?
I'll never do that again

905
01:53:41,614 --> 01:53:45,277
You can give me any punishment
you wish to

906
01:53:47,620 --> 01:53:52,614
But once... come back Rachait.
Just once

907
01:53:57,964 --> 01:54:04,301
I want to live again...
in your eyes, in your arms, Rachait

908
01:54:08,641 --> 01:54:10,632
I'll wait for you

909
01:54:11,978 --> 01:54:13,969
I'm going to wait for you

910
01:54:16,482 --> 01:54:19,815
I'll break every boundary
in my love for you, Rachait

911
01:54:20,820 --> 01:54:25,655
Stand up, Rachait.
Rise and destroy those...

912
01:54:25,725 --> 01:54:28,660
who have betrayed not just you,
they have betrayed the nation too!

913
01:56:14,433 --> 01:56:17,425
The CBI director says the two of us
can complete this mission

914
01:56:18,938 --> 01:56:20,428
There are three
missile stations here

915
01:56:20,506 --> 01:56:23,942
But which one is the closest,
I don't know. You'll have to...

916
01:56:28,280 --> 01:56:30,271
The General is very happy with you

917
01:56:31,784 --> 01:56:34,776
The way you have
finished the commandos...

918
01:56:36,455 --> 01:56:40,949
he has decided to reward you
with 5 billion rupees

919
01:56:41,394 --> 01:56:44,795
Thank you. Tell the General
that we will finish anyone...

920
01:56:44,897 --> 01:56:49,630
who stands in our way. Before the
Indian government makes another move...

921
01:56:49,802 --> 01:56:53,465
we'll put the pressure on them.
We'll scare them a bit more

922
01:56:53,806 --> 01:56:57,139
In a few hours, we're reaching
your country. God protect you

923
01:57:00,146 --> 01:57:02,137
Let me fire a missile on Mumbai!

924
01:57:02,481 --> 01:57:04,142
Only then will the C.M.
send the money

925
01:57:07,820 --> 01:57:10,482
Abbas, what are you doing?

926
01:57:10,823 --> 01:57:12,814
I'm going to put the whole of Mumbai
to eternal sleep!

927
01:57:12,925 --> 01:57:16,486
I only asked you to threaten them!
- I've said what I had to

928
01:57:18,831 --> 01:57:21,823
Gopal, let the missile go.
- Let's do it

929
01:57:22,001 --> 01:57:23,992
Abbas, hold it!

930
01:57:26,672 --> 01:57:28,663
Gopal, let go of the other missile

931
01:57:29,175 --> 01:57:32,338
Do what you want to.
I'm hurling a missile at them

932
01:57:32,445 --> 01:57:34,436
I'll kill you!
- Ali!

933
01:57:34,680 --> 01:57:36,671
Try killing me!

934
01:57:56,869 --> 01:57:58,860
That's Mumbai...

935
01:58:26,799 --> 01:58:28,892
Sir, they've fired a missile
from Elphinston Jail

936
01:58:47,253 --> 01:58:48,584
What have you done!

937
01:58:48,654 --> 01:58:51,589
What fear or bargaining power
do we now have!

938
01:58:52,424 --> 01:58:56,087
That C.M. wasn't sending us
the money! He'll send it now

939
01:58:56,262 --> 01:58:58,253
We won't get the money anymore

940
01:58:58,931 --> 01:59:01,923
We've contaminated their lake.
All our efforts have been in vain!

941
01:59:05,104 --> 01:59:08,938
Have you gone out of your mind?
- You guys were out of your minds

942
01:59:09,608 --> 01:59:12,441
I kept my nerve.
- Kept your nerve, my foot!

943
01:59:12,545 --> 01:59:16,948
I let the missile go,
but I took out the virus

944
01:59:17,049 --> 01:59:19,108
I've fired a blank missile!

945
01:59:20,619 --> 01:59:22,951
So you fired a blank missile?

946
01:59:23,055 --> 01:59:27,116
Because the virus isn't a bullet
you can fire at will

947
01:59:27,459 --> 01:59:31,793
The virus is priceless.
It's worth billions. Like me!

948
01:59:34,800 --> 01:59:37,462
We're saved! We're saved, Laila!

949
01:59:38,971 --> 01:59:41,303
Gopal, you're a genius.
- That I am!

950
01:59:41,473 --> 01:59:44,965
We are saved. Abbas, don't ever
do that again, brother

951
01:59:45,477 --> 01:59:49,470
Don't call me brother.
You fired at me!

952
01:59:49,648 --> 01:59:52,811
Out of love, brother.
Don't be angry with me

953
02:00:03,996 --> 02:00:05,987
You aren't angry with me,
are you?

954
02:00:15,007 --> 02:00:16,838
Let's embrace, brother

955
02:00:17,076 --> 02:00:19,510
C.M., do you see the power we wield?

956
02:00:19,678 --> 02:00:22,670
We wanted to undo the dhoti you wear,
not make you wet it

957
02:00:22,848 --> 02:00:25,180
Which is why we didn't load
the missile with the virus

958
02:00:26,018 --> 02:00:28,009
They had taken out the virus
from the missile

959
02:00:29,521 --> 02:00:31,352
Now tell us how many hours
you have left

960
02:00:31,523 --> 02:00:33,855
Eighteen.
- Wrong! 10 hours

961
02:00:34,693 --> 02:00:37,025
You tried to act smart
by sending those commandos

962
02:00:37,296 --> 02:00:38,695
So soon, how am I...
- Eight hours

963
02:00:38,897 --> 02:00:40,888
Listen to me, please...
- Six hours

964
02:00:41,033 --> 02:00:43,194
Four Two!

965
02:00:44,370 --> 02:00:45,359
One

966
02:00:45,537 --> 02:00:47,368
Want us to fire the missile?
- No, no!

967
02:00:48,874 --> 02:00:52,867
So let's settle at five hours.
150 billion and a ship

968
02:00:53,212 --> 02:00:55,203
Remember, we're really mad

969
02:00:55,381 --> 02:00:58,043
if you ruin our mood, we'll put
the whole of Mumbai to sleep

970
02:00:58,217 --> 02:01:02,210
Okay, I'll meet all your demands
in five hours. All right?

971
02:01:05,224 --> 02:01:07,715
What's happening, sir...?
They're dropping missiles on Mumbai?

972
02:01:07,860 --> 02:01:10,055
In the lake at Powai which
provides drinking water?

973
02:01:10,229 --> 02:01:12,220
I'm going to answer
all your questions

974
02:01:12,898 --> 02:01:15,731
it was an exercise on the part
of the defence ministry

975
02:01:17,236 --> 02:01:19,727
Why didn't you inform the public
well in advance?

976
02:01:20,072 --> 02:01:22,734
Many things the press get to know
even before the government does

977
02:01:22,908 --> 02:01:25,741
How did you miss out on this one?
- You're the one who missed out, sir!

978
02:03:02,841 --> 02:03:04,832
I can't believe this is the place
they have kept the missiles

979
02:03:09,515 --> 02:03:12,848
This is the compartment in which
the virus is loaded

980
02:03:28,700 --> 02:03:31,863
This is where the virus is.
One mistake could ruin everything

981
02:03:47,219 --> 02:03:49,551
Here's the virus in its hyper
concentrated bio-chemical matrix form

982
02:03:50,556 --> 02:03:52,547
This is the deadly virus

983
02:04:06,238 --> 02:04:08,399
One down. Now for the next

984
02:04:15,247 --> 02:04:16,908
No one's responding
from the ammunition room

985
02:04:17,082 --> 02:04:19,073
That's where the missiles are

986
02:04:24,923 --> 02:04:28,256
Without this chip, they
can't use the missile

987
02:04:59,691 --> 02:05:01,682
Where are we landing?

988
02:05:05,797 --> 02:05:07,788
Follow them!

989
02:05:13,305 --> 02:05:15,296
Where are we going?

990
02:05:17,309 --> 02:05:19,971
Rachait, they're firing!
Do something!

991
02:05:32,324 --> 02:05:34,315
We'll meet with
an accident, Rachait!

992
02:05:37,663 --> 02:05:39,654
Do something!

993
02:06:25,544 --> 02:06:28,377
You, Sheetal?!
- Rahul!

994
02:06:31,717 --> 02:06:33,378
You?!

995
02:06:38,557 --> 02:06:41,549
Sheetal, you, I...

996
02:06:42,394 --> 02:06:44,555
I kept calling you like a madman!
And here you are!

997
02:06:45,063 --> 02:06:47,395
They kidnapped me, stupid!

998
02:06:47,799 --> 02:06:49,790
That's all right.
But what are you doing here?

999
02:06:50,068 --> 02:06:52,229
I'm on a picnic!
I told you, didn't I?

1000
02:06:52,404 --> 02:06:54,065
But what are you doing here?

1001
02:06:54,406 --> 02:06:57,569
I... I'm here on a secret mission

1002
02:06:59,077 --> 02:07:00,738
You came to save me?

1003
02:07:02,814 --> 02:07:07,410
You came to save me!
My God!

1004
02:07:09,087 --> 02:07:11,078
Listen to me

1005
02:07:12,758 --> 02:07:15,591
Rachait, this is my girlfriend Sheetal

1006
02:07:15,761 --> 02:07:18,594
And this is Rachait,
a bit of a snob

1007
02:07:19,097 --> 02:07:22,589
We have very little time.
Here's the map

1008
02:07:24,102 --> 02:07:26,263
Two more missile stations left.
One in the library, one in the tower

1009
02:07:26,438 --> 02:07:28,429
Now which one is closer,
I don't...

1010
02:07:29,608 --> 02:07:31,599
Rachait is alive

1011
02:07:34,946 --> 02:07:36,937
Tell me something

1012
02:07:37,115 --> 02:07:39,948
Why've you tied a red
handkerchief on your mouth?

1013
02:07:40,118 --> 02:07:43,451
Strange man. Neither does he talk,
nor will he let me talk

1014
02:07:45,123 --> 02:07:47,614
You tell me. Do I talk too much?

1015
02:07:47,793 --> 02:07:52,127
Oh no. Where do you talk at all?
- Exactly. I wonder what he thinks

1016
02:07:53,465 --> 02:07:56,798
That's a toy-gun, isn't it?
- You think it's a toy-gun?

1017
02:07:57,135 --> 02:07:59,126
It's a real one

1018
02:08:05,143 --> 02:08:07,134
Where are you guys headed...?

1019
02:08:09,147 --> 02:08:11,138
Has the money arrived?

1020
02:08:22,160 --> 02:08:24,151
Guns, missiles...
what's going on over here?

1021
02:08:27,833 --> 02:08:29,323
Someone's coming

1022
02:08:31,837 --> 02:08:35,170
From behind, or towards the front?
- In the front...

1023
02:08:35,340 --> 02:08:38,002
back there, Rachait...
Where's Rachait?

1024
02:08:38,677 --> 02:08:44,513
Give me the gun and tell me
how it works. You go and stand there

1025
02:08:52,357 --> 02:08:54,348
Have you gone mad?

1026
02:09:16,047 --> 02:09:18,038
Rahul! What's he doing here?

1027
02:09:18,550 --> 02:09:20,541
He must be the one
who decoded the missile

1028
02:09:24,956 --> 02:09:28,551
Before he gets to the other missiles,
let's gun him down

1029
02:09:53,084 --> 02:09:55,075
Hey Romeo!

1030
02:09:56,588 --> 02:09:58,579
What have you come here for?

1031
02:09:59,424 --> 02:10:00,755
Brother...

1032
02:10:02,327 --> 02:10:05,763
I made a mistake. I ought to have
bumped him off with his Sapna!

1033
02:10:06,264 --> 02:10:08,596
I made a mistake!
A bloody mistake!

1034
02:10:12,437 --> 02:10:14,598
He has come here to die!
You stinking...

1035
02:11:24,743 --> 02:11:26,734
Laila, we've buried Rachait

1036
02:11:26,845 --> 02:11:28,836
You can shut the tunnel
from the other side now

1037
02:11:28,947 --> 02:11:31,848
So that they don't even
come across his soul

1038
02:11:34,352 --> 02:11:36,343
I've pulled out the pin.
Toss it at them quickly

1039
02:12:07,552 --> 02:12:11,044
What a bombshell! I must take her
out on a vacation!

1040
02:12:14,392 --> 02:12:17,884
We have either lost the signals,
or the camera is damaged

1041
02:12:21,733 --> 02:12:24,725
This is no technical glitch.
The two of them have been killed

1042
02:12:25,403 --> 02:12:27,735
When an officer like Akram Shaikh
was felled...

1043
02:12:27,806 --> 02:12:30,240
with outstanding commandos
of the nation...

1044
02:12:30,408 --> 02:12:34,401
what will these two clowns do?
- Mr Home Minister

1045
02:12:38,416 --> 02:12:40,407
Maybe you don't know my Rachait

1046
02:12:41,419 --> 02:12:46,254
He can fight any power on earth.
- That's your love for him speaking

1047
02:12:46,624 --> 02:12:51,755
Yes, my love possesses his soul.
And it won't let him die

1048
02:12:52,597 --> 02:12:56,431
There's no jail on earth from
which he cannot escape

1049
02:12:56,768 --> 02:12:58,759
History is witness to that

1050
02:13:00,772 --> 02:13:03,605
Rachait, they've blocked all the
ways through the tunnels

1051
02:13:04,109 --> 02:13:05,599
Come with us!

1052
02:13:05,777 --> 02:13:09,440
Shit! The path this way
is blocked too!

1053
02:13:14,452 --> 02:13:17,114
We're going to die here!
No one's coming to our rescue!

1054
02:13:17,389 --> 02:13:19,789
Why did you come here?
Even if I were dead...

1055
02:13:19,858 --> 02:13:23,954
at least you'd have lived!
Our love would have lived on!

1056
02:13:24,796 --> 02:13:27,458
I'm suffocating!
I'm going to die!

1057
02:13:27,799 --> 02:13:29,790
Do something, someone!

1058
02:13:34,806 --> 02:13:36,797
Nothing's happening to us!

1059
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:04,491
It's loaded!
I just loaded it

1060
02:14:12,677 --> 02:14:15,339
Gunpowder? What are you
going to do with it?

1061
02:15:09,734 --> 02:15:10,894
Rachait, go to the tower

1062
02:15:11,002 --> 02:15:13,232
I'll meet you there after
I've defused the rest of the missiles

1063
02:15:16,908 --> 02:15:20,071
We haven't been able to establish
contact! What are waiting for?

1064
02:15:20,578 --> 02:15:23,570
Just pay them if you want to
save the lives of millions!

1065
02:15:23,748 --> 02:15:25,909
Dollars, Pounds...
give them whatever they ask for!

1066
02:15:26,184 --> 02:15:30,587
Must we give you your share
or will you take it from them?

1067
02:15:30,922 --> 02:15:32,412
What?

1068
02:15:39,264 --> 02:15:42,097
Your pawn has told us everything

1069
02:15:42,600 --> 02:15:46,934
In any case, Akram had prepared a
pretty comprehensive file on you

1070
02:15:51,943 --> 02:15:55,106
Half an hour to go and the money
still hasn't arrived

1071
02:15:57,615 --> 02:15:59,606
Something is surely wrong

1072
02:15:59,717 --> 02:16:02,948
We're going to make the government's
plans go wrong now

1073
02:16:03,121 --> 02:16:04,952
Yes, everything is in place

1074
02:16:05,123 --> 02:16:09,958
We've made arrangements to jam the
signals of all tv and radio channels

1075
02:16:10,061 --> 02:16:15,795
You are the only ones who will now
feature on every radio and tv channel

1076
02:17:22,033 --> 02:17:26,026
Mumbai's under threat.
So is the rest of India

1077
02:17:26,704 --> 02:17:28,695
I'm Ali.
- I'm Abbas

1078
02:17:29,240 --> 02:17:33,199
In exactly 30 minutes, the people
in Mumbai will breathe their last

1079
02:17:33,478 --> 02:17:35,878
Because your government
does not care for you

1080
02:17:36,147 --> 02:17:39,378
if the government does not meet
our demands in half an hour...

1081
02:17:39,550 --> 02:17:41,541
we will fire the missile at Mumbai!

1082
02:17:41,719 --> 02:17:43,710
The missile is loaded
with a deadly virus

1083
02:17:44,055 --> 02:17:48,048
Which will kill you and the whole
city, in a matter of a few minutes

1084
02:17:49,060 --> 02:17:54,054
Listen, halt the transmission of
all tv and radio channels immediately

1085
02:17:54,165 --> 02:17:58,568
Tell the cable operators to suspend
their services till further notice

1086
02:17:58,736 --> 02:18:02,729
it's such a deadly virus,
anywhere it is dropped...

1087
02:18:03,241 --> 02:18:07,405
not even an animal is born for
150 years, let alone a human being

1088
02:18:07,745 --> 02:18:09,736
213 people, we have...

1089
02:18:11,416 --> 02:18:13,577
Looks like the government has
blocked all the tv channels

1090
02:18:13,918 --> 02:18:16,751
That's all right.
Our job is done

1091
02:18:16,921 --> 02:18:18,411
Mumbai must've gone berserk!

1092
02:18:52,623 --> 02:18:54,614
Bloody bull!

1093
02:21:22,273 --> 02:21:24,764
Allah, Abbas and Ali
are blowing up Mumbai

1094
02:21:26,277 --> 02:21:30,441
As long as there is in Mumbai Haji Ali,
no harm can do Abbas and Ali

1095
02:21:30,781 --> 02:21:32,772
You're dominating every channel today

1096
02:21:33,284 --> 02:21:35,445
Thanks. it's all because
of your patronage

1097
02:21:35,953 --> 02:21:38,786
Even we have not been able to scare
the Indian administration so much

1098
02:21:39,957 --> 02:21:42,448
Get to the naval border as soon
as you have completed your work

1099
02:21:43,461 --> 02:21:44,951
I'll personally come
to receive you there

1100
02:21:50,635 --> 02:21:52,796
Come here, my boy...

1101
02:21:53,304 --> 02:21:55,795
they send a duffer like you
to stop me?

1102
02:22:10,421 --> 02:22:13,822
I told you, Gopal.
Never use science for destruction

1103
02:22:14,325 --> 02:22:17,988
Sure, but I hope there are
girls and beaches up there

1104
02:22:22,333 --> 02:22:25,325
I'll issue orders to the Air Force
to blow them up

1105
02:22:25,503 --> 02:22:28,666
I can't risk the lives of millions
for the sake of just 213 hostages

1106
02:22:43,917 --> 02:22:45,851
I'll stop him!
Go and fire the missile!

1107
02:23:14,915 --> 02:23:16,883
Ali, you fire the missile!
I'll deal with him

1108
02:24:29,690 --> 02:24:34,423
No, no...
you can't fire at me

1109
02:24:34,928 --> 02:24:39,831
The moment you shoot,
Ali will let go of the missile!

1110
02:26:32,546 --> 02:26:33,808
Let go!

1111
02:26:39,052 --> 02:26:43,148
Leave Abbas alone!
Else, I'll kill this scientist!

1112
02:26:47,995 --> 02:26:51,556
Leave Abbas alone! Else I'll kill him!
- Don't worry about me!

1113
02:26:51,798 --> 02:26:53,789
Kill him, Rachait!
- Let him go, I say!

1114
02:26:53,934 --> 02:26:57,028
I'm sick of these blackmailers.
They hijack planes...

1115
02:26:57,271 --> 02:26:59,364
explode bombs,
poison our drinking water!

1116
02:26:59,640 --> 02:27:01,972
Don't spare him, Rachait.
Kill him!

1117
02:27:11,652 --> 02:27:13,586
Laila... my Laila!

1118
02:27:15,589 --> 02:27:19,582
Laila has saved me.
But what happens of you?

1119
02:27:20,594 --> 02:27:24,928
You're going to your Sapna!
You're going to Sapna!

1120
02:27:26,466 --> 02:27:29,958
Kill that man and his brother!
Let me die, Rachait!

1121
02:27:50,357 --> 02:27:53,019
You really... really...?!

1122
02:30:18,905 --> 02:30:21,100
Bloody thief!
You're taking sides with the cops?

1123
02:30:21,274 --> 02:30:23,765
When it's a question
of India and Pakistan...

1124
02:30:24,711 --> 02:30:26,770
every Indian is on one side

1125
02:30:28,048 --> 02:30:30,778
You're in a hurry to go
to Pakistan, aren't you?

1126
02:30:31,852 --> 02:30:34,787
Your brother and Laila
wanted to go there too

1127
02:30:40,160 --> 02:30:41,718
You're going there too

1128
02:31:11,825 --> 02:31:13,622
They've given us a smoke signal

1129
02:31:29,009 --> 02:31:30,340
Bless you, dear

1130
02:31:32,646 --> 02:31:34,841
Any news of Ali and Abbas?
- No, sir

1131
02:31:48,562 --> 02:31:52,862
Dear citizens of Mumbai,
your Mumbai is whole safe now

1132
02:31:53,767 --> 02:31:56,998
The two terrorists Abbas and Ali
have been decimated...

1133
02:31:57,304 --> 02:32:00,296
their missiles and the virus
have been destroyed...

1134
02:32:01,207 --> 02:32:06,543
Mumbai is like the Mumbai of old.
Beautiful Mumbai, our Mumbai

1135
02:32:06,947 --> 02:32:08,073
Hail India

1136
02:32:41,915 --> 02:32:45,078
Rachait is now a free man.
Go on. Live happily

1137
02:33:03,236 --> 02:33:07,400
Rachait, I made a grave mistake
in understanding you

1138
02:33:12,946 --> 02:33:15,278
I didn't keep my promise

1139
02:33:36,970 --> 02:33:38,301
Hold on! Wait!

1140
02:33:40,173 --> 02:33:44,337
Here's the scoundrel!
Why did you make a cripple out of me?

1141
02:33:47,614 --> 02:33:49,605
I only tried to save your life

1142
02:33:53,086 --> 02:33:55,987
He speaks! He can really speak!
