00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:04,502
India wins in the One Day international

00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:08,208
Heavy rains lash entire Tamil Nadu.

4
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:12,111
Cyclone has affected

5
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:18,780
60 fisherman from Yaazhnagar
a fishing hamlet near Chennai

6
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:20,619
who went to sea fishing
are missing.

7
00:04:21,794 --> 00:04:26,629
Since they haven't yet returned and
there's no information about them.

8
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:31,293
Fishermen in Yaazhnagar
are in fear and agitated.

9
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:47,410
Sir!

10
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:49,412
What happened?

11
00:04:49,756 --> 00:04:52,657
Finished searching north side,
search operation is going in south side.

12
00:04:56,562 --> 00:04:58,655
It's a week since they have
ventured into sea,

13
00:04:58,865 --> 00:04:59,923
they should've been here
day before yesterday itself.

14
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,998
But not of them has returned, sir.

15
00:05:02,201 --> 00:05:04,829
- You must find them.
- Please be patient.

16
00:05:05,204 --> 00:05:08,833
Naval boats and helicopters
are searching for them.

17
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:11,840
Let's expect good news.

18
00:05:36,402 --> 00:05:37,027
Okay, thank you.

19
00:05:37,236 --> 00:05:39,363
Sir, all the boats have
docked in an island,

20
00:05:39,572 --> 00:05:41,767
we've news that all the
fishermen are safe, sir.

21
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:35,753
What's the matter?

22
00:06:35,995 --> 00:06:39,431
- All have returned except one.
- One? Who is it?

23
00:06:39,632 --> 00:06:43,033
- Our Sura!
- Sura? What happened to him?

24
00:06:43,302 --> 00:06:44,769
We got caught in high sea cyclone,

25
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:49,271
we lost the direction and
were getting drifted,

26
00:06:49,475 --> 00:06:53,935
but Sura swam to find a safe island
and took all of us there.

27
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:58,607
When Coast Guards came to rescue us,
a boat capsized on the way back.

28
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:01,353
Coast guard saved us all.

29
00:07:01,554 --> 00:07:03,954
But don't know what had
happened to Sura.

30
00:07:04,223 --> 00:07:06,020
Why did you leave him behind?

31
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:09,126
Sir, we've rescued all
the missing fishermen.

32
00:07:09,328 --> 00:07:11,057
Don't know what happened to him?

33
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:16,232
Sir, they need... Okay sir.
I'll definitely do it sir.

34
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,529
Come, let's inform Collector.

35
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:20,973
Are you all happy?

36
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:23,074
- No, sir.
- Why?

37
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:26,803
One man is still missing, sir.

38
00:07:27,013 --> 00:07:28,810
- What are you saying?
- Yes.

39
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:33,075
Just one man?
Don't make it a big issue.

40
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:35,986
I've reported to CM about rescuing
all the missing fishermen.

41
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:39,516
I've given information on TV also.
Hush it up.

42
00:07:39,725 --> 00:07:42,558
Sir, without him we are nothing.

43
00:07:43,362 --> 00:07:46,331
We want him, order your men
to search for him.

44
00:07:46,532 --> 00:07:50,992
You want them to enter sea again instead
of being happy for rescuing others.

45
00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:53,672
Take it as this issue closed and
go back to your hamlet.

46
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:57,001
No sir, he's no angel to have
come from heaven,

47
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,768
he's also an ordinary man like us,

48
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:01,674
but he's equal to many mothers
in showering affection,

49
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:03,405
he's equal to hundred
elephants in strength,

50
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:05,516
he's equal to thousand lions
in bravery,

51
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:08,515
he's equal to hundred thousand
Machiavelli in intelligence.

52
00:08:08,721 --> 00:08:09,688
We need him, sir.

53
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:16,021
- We want Sura!
- Wait, be patient.

54
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:21,360
Nobody knows here whether
he's alive or not.

55
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:27,196
But it's not food or medicine
that keeps a man alive,

56
00:08:27,406 --> 00:08:29,271
it's well wishes of
good people like you,

57
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,033
that can keep a man
happy and alive.

58
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:33,537
A man who rules over
so many hearts,

59
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,545
death will not dare take
him away from you.

60
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:38,481
I'm sure he'll come back alive.

61
00:08:53,332 --> 00:08:57,564
He's our boy, who swims against
the tide to win...

62
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:02,163
He's a winner always...

63
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:07,235
His heart is cool snow mountain
and deadly volcano...

64
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:11,745
He's the dawn in
we poor people's lives...

65
00:10:04,503 --> 00:10:07,904
Hoist the flag of victory...
It's our sweep...

66
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:11,474
Future is all ours...

67
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:19,480
Lets' stay together like catamarans...
Nobody can win against us...

68
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:23,648
Let's stand together like
siblings of one mother...

69
00:10:23,856 --> 00:10:27,758
Must become role models
to the future world...

70
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:32,659
The world which thinks
we are just match sticks...

71
00:10:32,865 --> 00:10:37,325
Show them by friction
what you are...

72
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:15,534
Even crows have nests...
but poor don't have a hut too...

73
00:11:16,075 --> 00:11:23,379
If you ask won't the wind tell the
tale of our every day struggle...

74
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:31,482
Even hamlets will have happy times...
if we hard working hands stay together...

75
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:37,391
Heart that lives for others
randomly thinks of self...

76
00:11:37,596 --> 00:11:39,223
God has given me such a heart...

77
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:42,060
I'll seed myself in you...

78
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:50,903
I'll grow you in my heart...
I'm one of you only...

79
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:54,568
I'm giving myself to you,
take me...

80
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:58,307
Hoist the flag of victory...
It's our sweep...

81
00:11:58,517 --> 00:12:01,748
Future is all ours...

82
00:12:02,288 --> 00:12:09,820
Let's stay together like catamarans...
Nobody can win against us...

83
00:12:54,907 --> 00:13:02,313
If you and me prosper,
our nation will be clean...

84
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:10,314
Who else is there other
than me to bell the cat?

85
00:13:10,523 --> 00:13:17,986
If brave and courageous
follow me...

86
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:21,928
Let's pave a new path and
stamp out hypocrisy...

87
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:25,831
Let's question everything...

88
00:13:26,038 --> 00:13:32,443
When cool, I'm gentle breeze...
When angry, I'm a storm...

89
00:13:33,712 --> 00:13:41,016
I'm born lucky...
It's victory all my way...

90
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:44,849
Hoist the flag of victory...
It's our sweep...

91
00:13:45,057 --> 00:13:48,515
Future is all ours...

92
00:13:49,228 --> 00:13:56,862
Let's stay together like catamarans...
Nobody can win against us...

93
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:07,640
Yaazhnagar

94
00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:19,216
Why are you cleaning fish, Sura?

95
00:14:20,226 --> 00:14:22,319
My mother is not feeling well.

96
00:14:22,761 --> 00:14:25,161
May I help you?
I'm free.

97
00:14:26,398 --> 00:14:27,387
Free?

98
00:14:28,834 --> 00:14:30,631
Can't you go silently?

99
00:14:30,836 --> 00:14:33,737
- Sura, you come inside, son.
- Coming mother.

100
00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:43,411
You're looking after him like
a mother rearing her chicks,

101
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:46,977
watch out, I'll take him
away from you.

102
00:14:52,858 --> 00:14:55,656
Can I get you some chilly powder?

103
00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:59,829
That's waste, sister,
grinding will add taste.

104
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:04,861
Grinding chutney or flour,
washing clothes is exercise.

105
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:07,504
It'll keep your body slim
like a movie star.

106
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:14,736
You use all ready made things
and watch TV soaps.

107
00:15:14,947 --> 00:15:19,008
If there's not current you light
a candle to watch blank screen.

108
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:23,213
Your body will be like this only.
Like a flyover pillar.

109
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,084
Leave it sister.

110
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:32,360
Then my brothers-in-law and uncles
come to fight about your fat bodies.

111
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,425
Don't laugh, think over it.

112
00:15:39,004 --> 00:15:40,301
Okay, I'll go.

113
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:46,541
Where's the match box?
Mother!

114
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:01,224
What?

115
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:12,767
What's this son?

116
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:19,175
Don't fast when you're ill,
eat only the you'll get energy.

117
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:21,907
Enough, son.

118
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:26,110
- Eat mother.
- Serve yourself, son.

119
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:27,751
I will, you eat first.

120
00:16:27,953 --> 00:16:30,945
- Brother!
- What?

121
00:16:33,892 --> 00:16:36,588
My husband hasn't gone
for over a month to sea.

122
00:16:36,795 --> 00:16:38,353
I heard he wasn't feeling well.

123
00:16:38,564 --> 00:16:42,398
He's lying, he's getting
drunk every day.

124
00:16:42,601 --> 00:16:48,540
He's pawning things from home
to the usury money lender.

125
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:59,049
I'm doing odd jobs to earn and buy rice
from ration shop to feed my children.

126
00:16:59,885 --> 00:17:03,116
He has pawned the ration card too.

127
00:17:03,322 --> 00:17:08,021
Can't buy rice in ration shop
without the card.

128
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:11,594
I and my children haven't
eaten for two days.

129
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:15,800
Where is your husband?

130
00:17:16,001 --> 00:17:17,730
He's in usury money lender's home.

131
00:17:19,438 --> 00:17:21,497
- You have food here.
- No need, brother.

132
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:22,605
No problem, have food.

133
00:17:22,808 --> 00:17:24,799
Come, join me.

134
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,851
- Don't you know to repay?
- Please don't beat me.

135
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,647
- When will you repay?
- I'll repay.

136
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,855
Brother... brother...
storm is coming...

137
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:44,990
- What are you saying?
- Tsunami is coming!

138
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:51,400
- What are you blabbering?
- Both are coming together.

139
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:01,336
Sura, they are beating me,
please save me.

140
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:03,507
You must save...

141
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:09,184
Have you pawned ration card too
along with vessels?

142
00:18:10,055 --> 00:18:11,044
Are you human?

143
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:13,856
Is it just a card to buy rice
at subsidized rates?

144
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:17,027
It's an ID card that you're
a citizen of this country.

145
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:23,833
For how much he has
pawned ration card?

146
00:18:24,036 --> 00:18:28,370
Rs.500. It's now Rs.1000
with 10 days interest.

147
00:18:28,574 --> 00:18:32,567
What? Rs.500 interest
for 10 days for Rs.500.

148
00:18:33,145 --> 00:18:35,045
You're unjustly too good.

149
00:18:37,716 --> 00:18:41,117
Why are you keeping
so many photos of Gods?

150
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,947
Is it also pawned with you?

151
00:18:43,155 --> 00:18:45,851
No, I'm very God fearing man.

152
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:50,518
To be in God's vision,
I've placed all around me.

153
00:18:50,729 --> 00:18:53,391
You must see God always...
but what he says...

154
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:54,896
Tell me, brother.

155
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:59,699
Not me, you silly boy.
Great Annadurai!

156
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:02,398
He said see God in
poor man's smile.

157
00:19:02,941 --> 00:19:05,171
You needn't see God in
poor man's smile,

158
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:07,637
don't see God of death
in their tears.

159
00:19:08,547 --> 00:19:11,380
Parents sins must be
borne by their children.

160
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:13,016
Don't put the burden on your children.

161
00:19:13,218 --> 00:19:15,243
Who said this, brother?

162
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:19,186
- This idea is mine!
- Okay brother.

163
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:22,593
Am I going to their home to lend
money with high interest?

164
00:19:22,794 --> 00:19:24,523
They come seeking
and I'm lending.

165
00:19:24,796 --> 00:19:28,857
Lending money is a profession but
don't charge unjustly high interest.

166
00:19:30,702 --> 00:19:36,197
To warm up our home
don't burn other's house.

167
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:43,312
- How many cards are pawned?
- About 40 or 50.

168
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:46,347
You know its against law, don't you?

169
00:19:47,419 --> 00:19:52,049
I know it's a crime and
I know how to handle it as well.

170
00:19:53,091 --> 00:19:54,649
Inspector Dass!

171
00:20:00,732 --> 00:20:05,897
- Sister! Filed the FIR?
- It's done.

172
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:12,405
Outside money lender,
inside a pimp. Good show!

173
00:20:12,978 --> 00:20:16,311
Now I know how you're
managing law.

174
00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:23,110
Please take bath and go to the station,
if not you may be reported as missing.

175
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:28,123
Teasing me? Don't forget you're
talking to a police man.

176
00:20:29,795 --> 00:20:34,425
Aren't you ashamed to say that
in such a cheap place?

177
00:20:34,766 --> 00:20:35,698
Stop it!

178
00:20:36,635 --> 00:20:38,000
Why are you getting angry?

179
00:20:38,604 --> 00:20:43,041
Instead of arresting a usury,
you're enjoying women in his bedroom.

180
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,005
Why should you get angry, tell me?

181
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:47,939
You'll work fearing higher officials,

182
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:50,438
you'll work fearing politicians,

183
00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:53,345
you'll work fearing the
goons, mafia, murderers,

184
00:20:53,652 --> 00:20:57,019
have you every worked for
any poor man like him?

185
00:20:57,789 --> 00:20:59,620
Getting angry?

186
00:21:00,058 --> 00:21:04,188
You needn't serve people,
just work for your salary.

187
00:21:04,396 --> 00:21:06,023
How dare you taunt me!

188
00:21:16,675 --> 00:21:22,204
Think as many times as possible
before you dare touch me.

189
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:27,650
Once you touch me,
then you'll not have time to think.

190
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:30,982
If you've courage,
dare touch me.

191
00:21:31,189 --> 00:21:31,985
If I do...

192
00:21:34,693 --> 00:21:36,217
You'll get a jolt!

193
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:41,796
No... please leave him, Sura.

194
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,991
I'll return all the ration cards
pawned with me.

195
00:21:44,202 --> 00:21:45,169
Leave him.

196
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:08,655
O Goddess Nagamma!

197
00:22:09,628 --> 00:22:12,927
I'm going to participate
in the boat race.

198
00:22:13,131 --> 00:22:21,539
Bless me the strength to win
this race against all odds.

199
00:22:21,773 --> 00:22:26,107
Bless me Goddess!

200
00:22:27,746 --> 00:22:28,508
Why are you shouting like that?

201
00:22:28,714 --> 00:22:31,274
- It's not shout but victory cry!
- Victory cry!

202
00:22:31,817 --> 00:22:34,285
What's this weak beat?

203
00:22:34,653 --> 00:22:38,612
Beat should be so fast,
it must break into pieces!

204
00:22:38,824 --> 00:22:39,791
Play the fast beat!

205
00:22:45,097 --> 00:22:46,291
Stop... stop...

206
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:50,134
Ladies and gentlemen...

207
00:22:50,335 --> 00:22:52,303
How can they hear it you
hold the mike wrongly?

208
00:22:52,504 --> 00:22:53,402
Sorry brother.

209
00:22:53,772 --> 00:22:56,400
Ladies and gentlemen,

210
00:22:56,842 --> 00:22:59,640
residents of this hamlet,

211
00:23:00,112 --> 00:23:04,071
for the 18th boat race
taking today,

212
00:23:04,282 --> 00:23:09,481
brother Umbrella is leaving
to participate,

213
00:23:09,688 --> 00:23:11,713
we are very happy to announce it.

214
00:23:11,923 --> 00:23:18,988
Not only that anyone giving him camphor
and garland welcome will be get Rs.50...

215
00:23:19,865 --> 00:23:21,162
When did I promise to pay money?

216
00:23:21,366 --> 00:23:23,163
Sorry brother, I said in a flow.

217
00:23:23,368 --> 00:23:24,892
He has announced it publicly,
give as he says.

218
00:23:25,537 --> 00:23:26,902
I don't have money.

219
00:23:27,606 --> 00:23:28,573
Why are you worried about money?

220
00:23:28,807 --> 00:23:30,672
I sold off the bangles from your house.

221
00:23:31,042 --> 00:23:33,943
- Sold off bangles?
- You told me last night.

222
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:36,671
- I said it for fun.
- You said it, didn't you?

223
00:23:37,149 --> 00:23:38,514
Play...

224
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:45,518
I'll take you to task after the function.

225
00:23:46,158 --> 00:23:47,853
- Money...
- Pay him.

226
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:48,957
Put the garland.

227
00:23:55,734 --> 00:23:56,462
Next!

228
00:23:56,668 --> 00:23:58,932
Don't light fire to the paddle,
you silly woman.

229
00:24:00,572 --> 00:24:03,370
Dance like that!
Stop... stop...

230
00:24:03,675 --> 00:24:04,642
Brother Umbrella.

231
00:24:05,243 --> 00:24:08,041
- Boat race is going on here, right?
- Yes.

232
00:24:08,246 --> 00:24:11,374
Only my boat is here,
where the other boats?

233
00:24:13,218 --> 00:24:14,583
- Brother!
- What?

234
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:17,550
- Then, you're unopposed.
- What's that?

235
00:24:17,756 --> 00:24:19,883
No competitor is ready
to challenge you.

236
00:24:20,091 --> 00:24:22,559
- Then, you've won unopposed.
- You'll get the cup.

237
00:24:22,761 --> 00:24:25,730
- Have I won like that?
- Yes.

238
00:24:25,931 --> 00:24:27,398
Where will I get the cup?

239
00:24:27,766 --> 00:24:29,393
- From our referee.
- Where's he?

240
00:24:29,601 --> 00:24:31,728
The man sleeping over there
is the referee.

241
00:24:31,937 --> 00:24:34,064
Play music to wake him up.

242
00:24:37,275 --> 00:24:39,175
Look, how he's sleeping without
giving me the cup!

243
00:24:39,611 --> 00:24:41,078
- Stop... Referee!
- Stop it.

244
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:45,841
Get up! Get down.
Sleeping like a log!

245
00:24:46,451 --> 00:24:49,648
All other competitors have
left the field fearing me,

246
00:24:49,955 --> 00:24:51,252
then I'm the winner, right?

247
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:55,688
Instead of giving me the cup
you're sleeping like a pig.

248
00:24:56,061 --> 00:24:57,858
- What did you ask?
- Give me the cup.

249
00:24:58,063 --> 00:25:00,088
- Asking cup!
- Hold me!

250
00:25:00,298 --> 00:25:03,199
- Why did you slap me now?
- What else then?

251
00:25:03,735 --> 00:25:04,929
What was time was the
race will begin?

252
00:25:05,136 --> 00:25:07,502
- By morning 6 am.
- It's evening 6 pm now.

253
00:25:08,707 --> 00:25:10,265
Evening 6 pm?

254
00:25:10,575 --> 00:25:13,840
Silly fellows!
Did I come at evening 6 pm?

255
00:25:14,045 --> 00:25:18,675
Asking cup after the competition
is already over.

256
00:25:18,884 --> 00:25:21,910
I was given grand reception
all the way to here.

257
00:25:22,153 --> 00:25:22,778
That's why I got late.

258
00:25:22,988 --> 00:25:24,615
Will you finish the competition
and give the cup?

259
00:25:24,823 --> 00:25:25,949
When should you do this?

260
00:25:26,491 --> 00:25:28,618
You should've done this while going back
after winning the competition.

261
00:25:28,827 --> 00:25:30,954
Why did you do all this
while coming to participate?

262
00:25:31,162 --> 00:25:32,390
Would I give you the cup?

263
00:25:32,831 --> 00:25:37,632
You've been cheating me for 18 years
finishing the race before I come.

264
00:25:37,836 --> 00:25:39,303
I'll not leave the place
without settling this matter.

265
00:25:39,504 --> 00:25:43,304
For 18 years you've been torturing me
for cup coming late to the race.

266
00:25:43,508 --> 00:25:49,469
Hereafter you mustn't
ever ask the cup.

267
00:26:03,361 --> 00:26:08,560
What's this Sura, you're offering
prayers like in a temple?

268
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:13,666
Ayyanar or Jesus or Allah
are all my Gods!

269
00:26:13,872 --> 00:26:15,840
Jesus will always be with you.

270
00:26:17,042 --> 00:26:19,340
I want to tell you something, Father.

271
00:26:25,884 --> 00:26:28,512
You've told me, right?
I'll take care of it.

272
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,517
- You don't worry.
- Greetings Father.

273
00:26:30,722 --> 00:26:33,020
- Why are you here mother?
- Shut up son.

274
00:26:33,224 --> 00:26:36,955
- Father, I wanted to bring him to you.
- Why?

275
00:26:37,162 --> 00:26:41,861
- He's refusing to marry.
You advice him, Father. - Why?

276
00:26:43,802 --> 00:26:49,365
Father, our hamlet may appear to have
many houses from a distance.

277
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:53,870
Only when you get near
you'll know it's all just huts.

278
00:26:55,013 --> 00:27:00,883
For others rain will fall outside home
but for us inside too.

279
00:27:01,553 --> 00:27:04,317
Rain water will flow
through our homes.

280
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:08,218
Spreading many diseases.

281
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:18,394
We've to take our children to some
school building for shelter like livestock.

282
00:27:20,939 --> 00:27:23,965
We've to stand like beggars for
the food provided by the government.

283
00:27:26,277 --> 00:27:30,839
Forget about summer, nobody knows when
and how our huts get gutted down.

284
00:27:31,449 --> 00:27:37,149
But it's a regular feature like festival.
Isn't it, mother?

285
00:27:38,456 --> 00:27:39,821
This is our life, Father.

286
00:27:41,459 --> 00:27:43,359
To escape from this
precarious condition,

287
00:27:43,561 --> 00:27:46,928
we need a good house that
will stand heat and rain.

288
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:50,266
I'll marry only after building
such a house.

289
00:27:50,468 --> 00:27:53,926
Good! Every man needs a house.

290
00:27:54,706 --> 00:27:59,939
Tell me how much you've,
I'll arrange for the balance.

291
00:28:00,145 --> 00:28:01,271
You build a home.

292
00:28:03,214 --> 00:28:05,705
If it was me only
I'd have done it long back,

293
00:28:05,984 --> 00:28:09,112
I'm talking about 1400 families
in my hamlet.

294
00:28:13,324 --> 00:28:19,786
Every father and mother in my village
consider me as their own son,

295
00:28:20,265 --> 00:28:23,962
every brother and sister there
consider me as their sibling,

296
00:28:27,172 --> 00:28:28,799
shouldn't I do something for them?

297
00:28:29,674 --> 00:28:31,471
- I must do, Father.
- How?

298
00:28:32,677 --> 00:28:34,076
I'm thinking about it.

299
00:28:34,579 --> 00:28:41,314
Our people know to work hard but
don't know how to make money.

300
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:43,647
I must bring order in their lives.

301
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:50,320
Must build homes for them
at any cost, bye Father.

302
00:28:53,698 --> 00:28:55,325
Did you hear him, Father?

303
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:58,828
We've to take loan to change
the thatched roof,

304
00:28:59,137 --> 00:29:02,163
when will he build houses for them
and when will he marry?

305
00:29:02,474 --> 00:29:06,501
He doesn't want to go from this world
without any achievement,

306
00:29:06,711 --> 00:29:09,339
your son wants his life
to be meaningful.

307
00:29:10,715 --> 00:29:16,347
Only one a million will think
about other's welfare.

308
00:29:16,888 --> 00:29:20,790
But only one in 10 millions
will do it,

309
00:29:22,227 --> 00:29:24,627
let's see what your son will do.

310
00:29:35,206 --> 00:29:38,972
Didn't you see near sea for ten days?

311
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:43,644
I've danger in water,
so I tried to find another job.

312
00:29:43,848 --> 00:29:47,375
- Did you get it?
- I did get... but refused it.

313
00:29:47,585 --> 00:29:48,381
Why?

314
00:29:48,753 --> 00:29:50,220
They are offering job
where I've to sweat.

315
00:29:50,421 --> 00:29:51,718
How can I accept it?

316
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:55,891
You always say about
danger in water,

317
00:29:56,261 --> 00:29:58,388
how about bath, drinking water
and other things?

318
00:29:58,596 --> 00:30:02,054
That's different form this, right?

319
00:30:02,767 --> 00:30:05,065
You've become a freeloader
without doing any work.

320
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:08,967
You can't say it openly,
you can say something like that.

321
00:30:13,945 --> 00:30:15,242
Who is it?

322
00:30:35,133 --> 00:30:36,930
- What?
- Hold the net.

323
00:30:37,135 --> 00:30:39,035
Forget about net,
look at that statue.

324
00:30:40,138 --> 00:30:42,436
She looks like a mermaid on shore.

325
00:30:42,807 --> 00:30:46,265
- Mermaid has no legs just fins.
- What?

326
00:30:49,814 --> 00:30:53,215
She's applying make up,
is she an actress?

327
00:30:53,418 --> 00:30:55,443
- Yes, she's an actress.
- Actress?

328
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:57,344
- What's her name?
- K R Vijaya!

329
00:30:57,555 --> 00:31:02,549
- K R... don't I know K R Vijaya?
- This is latest.

330
00:31:02,827 --> 00:31:04,454
Latest?

331
00:31:04,929 --> 00:31:06,794
You mean a remake?

332
00:31:07,665 --> 00:31:10,896
He's staring at me.

333
00:31:13,271 --> 00:31:18,641
The expensive scent is fragrant
in this lousy fish smell.

334
00:31:18,843 --> 00:31:20,470
It's not fragrant to me.

335
00:31:20,678 --> 00:31:24,478
You must have taste for it.
Why?

336
00:31:24,682 --> 00:31:27,480
Normal humans will have taste
in tongue only.

337
00:31:28,019 --> 00:31:29,987
Only fools taste with nose.

338
00:31:35,293 --> 00:31:37,818
The girl is smiling at me!

339
00:31:39,197 --> 00:31:41,324
Sura, she's coming towards us.

340
00:31:41,532 --> 00:31:44,933
Not us, she's looking
at you only, Umbrella.

341
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:48,337
Looking at me?
Why is she coming towards me?

342
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:55,045
It seems fair girls like her go mad
on seeing dark guys like you.

343
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:57,840
Mad? What are you saying?

344
00:31:58,216 --> 00:32:01,185
One important thing,

345
00:32:01,386 --> 00:32:05,015
If she comes and says
I love you to me, and kisses me,

346
00:32:05,223 --> 00:32:07,350
you mustn't get shattered
and sport a beard in sorrow.

347
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:13,124
He spat correctly into my hands.

348
00:32:13,364 --> 00:32:16,527
I thought you came,
you've hundred...

349
00:32:18,136 --> 00:32:21,264
Why did she come straight
and took a turn suddenly?

350
00:32:21,472 --> 00:32:22,700
Am I not handsome?

351
00:32:23,741 --> 00:32:26,209
He's turning to beat me.

352
00:32:28,012 --> 00:32:29,411
Oh Sea mummy!

353
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:33,983
No! Oh Sea Mother!
Accept this destitute.

354
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:39,651
She's drowning herself to death
instead of saying I love you.

355
00:32:39,924 --> 00:32:43,724
- Both are same, leave it.
- Don't take it as fun, save her life.

356
00:32:43,928 --> 00:32:46,897
Only youth like me know
the value of a life.

357
00:32:47,098 --> 00:32:47,962
I must mend the net.

358
00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:51,567
You can mend it anytime,
but you must save a girl's life first.

359
00:32:51,769 --> 00:32:55,899
You must save such beautiful
girls, go... go get her!

360
00:32:56,674 --> 00:32:58,733
Hey girl! Hey girl!

361
00:32:58,943 --> 00:33:00,570
- Stop!
- Leave me. I want to die.

362
00:33:00,778 --> 00:33:04,908
- I can't live without my Ramesh.
- Love failure? Come... come...

363
00:33:05,249 --> 00:33:08,912
No, please leave me.
I can't live without my Ramesh.

364
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:14,080
If you miss a Ramesh, you may get
Suresh, Dinesh or a Ganesh.

365
00:33:14,392 --> 00:33:17,759
I can't change my heart like that.
I don't want this life without Ramesh.

366
00:33:18,129 --> 00:33:19,596
Leave me.

367
00:33:27,238 --> 00:33:29,035
He went into the sea with the girl.

368
00:33:32,643 --> 00:33:33,701
He has come back.

369
00:33:37,749 --> 00:33:38,773
Hey girl!

370
00:33:41,652 --> 00:33:42,880
That's it!

371
00:33:44,088 --> 00:33:44,952
He has done it.

372
00:33:45,289 --> 00:33:46,449
What's this man?

373
00:33:58,636 --> 00:33:59,568
Sand!

374
00:33:59,837 --> 00:34:02,635
Is any exhibition going on here?
Call ambulance!

375
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:05,968
- Move... move... move...
- Who is it?

376
00:34:07,578 --> 00:34:11,639
Ambulance is for males only.
For females, do first aid first.

377
00:34:12,517 --> 00:34:13,984
First aid? How is it done?

378
00:34:14,185 --> 00:34:17,643
People who drown in sea
would drink water.

379
00:34:17,855 --> 00:34:23,316
So put your hands on stomach
and press... press... press...

380
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:26,257
If I press so much her intestines
may come out.

381
00:34:26,531 --> 00:34:27,156
Tell me what next.

382
00:34:27,365 --> 00:34:30,926
The water will come out
from mouth if you press.

383
00:34:31,135 --> 00:34:32,500
Please press!

384
00:34:34,038 --> 00:34:35,665
I'm feeling shy.

385
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,941
Don't feel shy off from duty!
Come on press.

386
00:34:39,143 --> 00:34:40,838
- You're asking me to do it.
- Yes, dear.

387
00:34:41,045 --> 00:34:43,775
Okay, elder's advice, I'll press...

388
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:50,186
- Excuse me.
- What?

389
00:34:50,621 --> 00:34:56,856
My soul wants to help you in this job.
Can I also join you?

390
00:34:57,428 --> 00:35:00,864
Okay, I'll cover the right area
and you cover the left area.

391
00:35:01,499 --> 00:35:02,261
Thank you.

392
00:35:14,912 --> 00:35:15,810
What were you planning to do?

393
00:35:16,314 --> 00:35:20,045
We both were trying to press out
the water from your stomach...

394
00:35:20,251 --> 00:35:22,617
Is it community well for you both?

395
00:35:23,187 --> 00:35:23,949
Not like that...

396
00:35:24,155 --> 00:35:26,214
Okay, you lie down,
they must do the first aid.

397
00:35:26,424 --> 00:35:27,721
I'll beat you with slipper.

398
00:35:28,192 --> 00:35:31,992
- She's sitting and you want
us to do first aid. - Rascal!

399
00:35:32,196 --> 00:35:33,720
Why did you save my life?

400
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:38,464
You told me to save her, didn't you?
Do I need this insult?

401
00:35:38,669 --> 00:35:39,966
Hey mister! Talk to me.

402
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,072
Did you her again?

403
00:35:43,274 --> 00:35:46,903
Look, if you talk too much,
I'll drown you in sea myself.

404
00:35:47,111 --> 00:35:49,238
Move... move...

405
00:35:49,447 --> 00:35:50,914
Why a big crowd has gathered here?

406
00:35:51,115 --> 00:35:52,582
- Who is this cartoon?
- Who is he?

407
00:35:53,117 --> 00:35:55,244
Poornima! Why did you take
a hasty decision?

408
00:35:55,419 --> 00:35:57,182
Your Ramesh has come back.

409
00:35:57,455 --> 00:35:59,082
Has my Ramesh come back?
Where is he?

410
00:36:13,871 --> 00:36:17,932
Is he Ramesh?
The boy is handsome.

411
00:36:18,543 --> 00:36:21,774
It's justified to commit suicide
for losing such a man.

412
00:36:30,821 --> 00:36:32,618
Bloody!

413
00:36:42,066 --> 00:36:44,364
Where did you go away, my dear?
Why are you angry on me?

414
00:36:46,003 --> 00:36:48,301
Dog and daddy have similar face.

415
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:53,640
Why are you feeling as if lost
husband and wife have united?

416
00:36:53,844 --> 00:36:58,144
- Go man!
- Who is Ramesh?

417
00:36:58,349 --> 00:37:01,318
The dog my daughter is fondling,
that's Ramesh.

418
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:04,579
- That boy next to her?
- He's my cousin Jimmy.

419
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:10,990
They've named Dog as Ramesh and
man as Jimmy, good family, right?

420
00:37:11,195 --> 00:37:11,991
Good family.

421
00:37:13,864 --> 00:37:14,592
Thanks.

422
00:37:14,799 --> 00:37:16,664
I tried to kill myself
after losing Ramesh,

423
00:37:16,867 --> 00:37:19,665
thanks once again for
saving my life. Bye.

424
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:21,064
Hello... hello...

425
00:37:21,505 --> 00:37:27,171
That's fine, but why did you get down
from car and applied make up?

426
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:30,570
Anyway my body will wash
ashore after death,

427
00:37:30,815 --> 00:37:32,783
then press and TV media
will take pictures,

428
00:37:33,284 --> 00:37:35,844
my face will be dull
without make up, right?

429
00:37:36,053 --> 00:37:38,180
That's why! Bye. See you.

430
00:37:38,389 --> 00:37:40,357
That's a drab end.

431
00:38:31,442 --> 00:38:33,239
Sir, the vehicles have left.

432
00:39:00,438 --> 00:39:01,063
Sir!

433
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,167
Sir, Minister has left after the program.

434
00:39:08,612 --> 00:39:10,079
Pack it with paper.

435
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:13,346
No, the goods will be ready.

436
00:39:13,551 --> 00:39:14,916
- Greetings sir.
- Greetings sir.

437
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:16,417
Greetings.

438
00:39:21,459 --> 00:39:22,357
Tell me brother.

439
00:39:22,626 --> 00:39:23,752
- No problem, right?
- No.

440
00:39:23,961 --> 00:39:30,867
- Have all the goods reached?
- Yes, brother.

441
00:39:32,303 --> 00:39:33,270
What's the Seth saying?

442
00:39:33,471 --> 00:39:34,768
He's here with cash.

443
00:39:35,906 --> 00:39:36,873
You'll get the goods.

444
00:39:37,141 --> 00:39:38,108
Yes sir.

445
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:41,844
- We'll go.
- Bye.

446
00:39:45,816 --> 00:39:48,114
Ravi! Down the shutters!

447
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:50,850
All of you come here.

448
00:39:55,326 --> 00:39:58,625
There's a man inside
other than our men.

449
00:40:00,164 --> 00:40:02,291
That's not possible, brother.

450
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:07,469
- Yes, there is a man inside.
- Search. Do it fast.

451
00:40:22,186 --> 00:40:24,245
- Who is he?
- Journalist.

452
00:40:27,057 --> 00:40:29,719
Crime is crime even if you
open your third eye.

453
00:40:36,534 --> 00:40:37,330
He has photographed it very well.

454
00:40:37,535 --> 00:40:40,663
If we hadn't been careful,
it'll make tomorrow's headlines.

455
00:40:40,871 --> 00:40:42,839
You would lose your Ministry too.

456
00:40:45,976 --> 00:40:52,438
I appreciate your courage and
smartness to enter my den.

457
00:40:52,850 --> 00:41:01,485
But your perfume helped me to
find a stranger inside my godown.

458
00:41:03,394 --> 00:41:05,123
Good fragrance.

459
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:11,196
Neither I nor my men use perfumes.

460
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:13,698
Give the phone to him.

461
00:41:16,574 --> 00:41:20,135
Take it.

462
00:41:21,745 --> 00:41:22,712
Switch it on.

463
00:41:24,081 --> 00:41:27,209
- Switch it on!
- Switch it on I say!

464
00:41:28,252 --> 00:41:29,276
Record it.

465
00:41:31,255 --> 00:41:32,882
Record it I say!

466
00:41:35,426 --> 00:41:37,291
My name is Samudrarajan.

467
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:40,228
I was born to rule over the sea.

468
00:41:40,431 --> 00:41:43,730
I'm an emperor in smuggling.

469
00:41:44,535 --> 00:41:48,062
Politician is just a mask.

470
00:41:48,272 --> 00:41:54,074
To protect myself I won by rigging
polls to become a Minister.

471
00:42:01,285 --> 00:42:04,311
- We must be extra careful.
- Okay, brother.

472
00:42:16,166 --> 00:42:17,133
One tea for me.

473
00:42:17,334 --> 00:42:19,700
Didn't go for fishing today, Sura?

474
00:42:19,904 --> 00:42:24,807
No, Srilankan Navy shot at
fishermen of Rameshwaram.

475
00:42:25,009 --> 00:42:26,306
One of them died.

476
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:29,479
So as a protest Tamil Nadu fishermen
didn't venture into sea.

477
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:30,476
Picketing work.

478
00:42:30,681 --> 00:42:33,980
You're picketing and
they are firing at us.

479
00:42:34,184 --> 00:42:35,811
- It's never ending.
- Tea.

480
00:42:36,353 --> 00:42:40,983
Tamils are the first to shed a tear for
anyone in distress anywhere in world.

481
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:43,652
But there's no one to
wipe his tears now.

482
00:42:43,861 --> 00:42:45,385
When will this come to an end?

483
00:42:47,865 --> 00:42:50,493
A day will dawn.
I've hope!

484
00:42:50,701 --> 00:42:59,336
Buy pen sir... just Rs.5 only...

485
00:42:59,543 --> 00:43:05,175
- Excuse me, re-charge please.
- Buy pen sir... just Rs.5 only...

486
00:43:05,883 --> 00:43:12,345
Buy pen sir... just Rs.5 only...

487
00:43:16,226 --> 00:43:17,193
What happened?

488
00:43:17,394 --> 00:43:19,191
I can't walk any further.

489
00:43:19,663 --> 00:43:23,861
- Get up.
- I can't. I'm hungry.

490
00:43:25,069 --> 00:43:26,366
Two teas please.

491
00:43:28,238 --> 00:43:30,536
Haven't eaten for two day now.

492
00:43:30,741 --> 00:43:34,700
What can I do?
Unable to sell one pen also.

493
00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:36,876
Not a penny in hand.

494
00:43:37,247 --> 00:43:40,876
If I can sell a pen,
I can buy you a tea.

495
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:47,720
Please buy pen sir.
Pen sir... pen sir...

496
00:43:47,925 --> 00:43:53,886
- Cancel the tea.
- Please buy pen sir. Pen sir...

497
00:43:54,098 --> 00:43:57,659
- What's the price of a pen?
- Rs.5 each one sir.

498
00:43:58,268 --> 00:44:00,065
Give me 20 pens, brother.

499
00:44:00,537 --> 00:44:04,473
- Hubby... hubby...
- Please wait.

500
00:44:06,443 --> 00:44:07,239
Take it sir.

501
00:44:11,248 --> 00:44:13,739
- Take Rs.100.
- God bless you sir.

502
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:14,576
Thank you very much sir.

503
00:44:14,785 --> 00:44:17,083
No need to thank me,
I'm like your younger brother.

504
00:44:17,287 --> 00:44:19,812
- May I go now?
- Sir, one minute.

505
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:22,181
Is there any hotel nearby?

506
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:26,255
Hotel is opposite side.
Come, I'll take you there.

507
00:45:00,497 --> 00:45:01,623
- Hi!
- Hello!

508
00:45:03,267 --> 00:45:05,565
Hello! How come you're here?

509
00:45:05,769 --> 00:45:08,067
- How is Ramesh doing?
- He's fine.

510
00:45:09,173 --> 00:45:10,037
What has brought you here?

511
00:45:10,574 --> 00:45:12,838
I stopped the car for phone re-charge.

512
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:19,981
I was watching you buying pens from him
and helping them cross the road.

513
00:45:20,751 --> 00:45:21,809
That's alright,

514
00:45:22,186 --> 00:45:28,421
but they would've been more happy if
you'd given money without buying pens.

515
00:45:29,193 --> 00:45:35,655
They didn't beg though they didn't
have food for two days,

516
00:45:36,133 --> 00:45:39,000
They were adamant to eat
only after selling the pens.

517
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:41,997
Why should I give Rs.100 and
make them beggars?

518
00:45:44,141 --> 00:45:49,443
Please buy things from such people.
It will be helpful to them.

519
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:50,778
May I go now?

520
00:45:56,987 --> 00:45:58,386
Okay, leave it.

521
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:00,352
- Take them away.
- Thanks sir. - Bye sir.

522
00:46:01,024 --> 00:46:02,753
- Come children.
- Bye daddy.

523
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,222
- Bye daddy.
- Bye... bye.

524
00:46:05,462 --> 00:46:09,592
I'll drop children in school
and visit the temple.

525
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:13,065
Be careful, tell the driver
to drive carefully.

526
00:46:19,042 --> 00:46:20,475
When is the next consignment coming?

527
00:46:20,778 --> 00:46:23,906
I've talked to Indonesians,
we'll get the stock by tonight.

528
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:24,808
Follow it.

529
00:46:29,186 --> 00:46:31,848
Greetings sir.
My name is Suresh Reddy.

530
00:46:32,422 --> 00:46:35,323
- My father, Rami Reddy.
- Greetings sir.

531
00:46:35,559 --> 00:46:36,491
Please come in.

532
00:46:37,094 --> 00:46:40,996
You're a big realtor all over India,
you've come to me?

533
00:46:41,198 --> 00:46:42,028
What's the matter?

534
00:46:42,232 --> 00:46:44,564
There's a fishing hamlet
Yaazhnagar nearby.

535
00:46:44,768 --> 00:46:46,531
Yes, it's my area.

536
00:46:46,737 --> 00:46:52,869
Actually, it's a private land, father bought it
from Subramanya Mudaliar in 1958.

537
00:46:53,076 --> 00:46:54,008
Yes sir.

538
00:46:58,282 --> 00:47:00,113
These are the land documents.

539
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:04,981
It was empty during the initial period.

540
00:47:05,422 --> 00:47:08,255
Few fishermen put up huts later.

541
00:47:08,458 --> 00:47:10,619
Now it has developed
into a hamlet.

542
00:47:11,395 --> 00:47:14,694
We concentrated on our business
interests in Andhra Pradesh.

543
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:17,293
So, we didn't care about
this place.

544
00:47:17,935 --> 00:47:22,770
Now we've decided to build
a theme park there like VGP.

545
00:47:22,973 --> 00:47:23,871
Yes sir.

546
00:47:24,441 --> 00:47:28,138
We can't vacate them and
reclaim the land.

547
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:29,369
It's very difficult.

548
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:35,143
Moreover if anyone goes to the court,
situation will get more complicated.

549
00:47:35,385 --> 00:47:39,048
You know well, how many years
a civil case will take.

550
00:47:40,090 --> 00:47:41,682
That's why we've come to you.

551
00:47:41,892 --> 00:47:44,554
If you decide, you can vacate them.

552
00:47:45,596 --> 00:47:46,255
Father!

553
00:47:49,132 --> 00:47:51,657
It's Rs.50 millions.

554
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:55,497
If you vacate the hamlet,
we'll pay another Rs.50 millions.

555
00:47:56,273 --> 00:47:59,731
Not for the money,
such big people have come to me,

556
00:48:00,177 --> 00:48:02,008
I must do at least for that.

557
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:05,242
Give me little time, I'll do it.

558
00:48:05,382 --> 00:48:08,078
- Bye sir.
- Okay. Bye.

559
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:13,189
Why are you coming so happily?

560
00:48:13,657 --> 00:48:17,684
Am I happy? You feel I'm happy
with all these bandages.

561
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:18,759
Are you not happy then?
Forget it.

562
00:48:18,962 --> 00:48:22,591
Wait! Won't you ask me
why am I with bandages?

563
00:48:22,799 --> 00:48:24,198
Okay, why and what?

564
00:48:24,401 --> 00:48:25,527
Better you don't ask it.

565
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:26,327
Stop!

566
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:28,037
- I'll ask now.
- Ask me.

567
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:30,331
Why are you hands and legs
bandaged and ring in the finger?

568
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:32,599
Where and how many beat
you for how long?

569
00:48:32,809 --> 00:48:36,210
Great wish! Beat me always!

570
00:48:36,446 --> 00:48:38,311
Tell me, I'm excited to hear.

571
00:48:38,515 --> 00:48:39,982
How eager to get entertained!

572
00:48:40,183 --> 00:48:41,810
I was watching a film,

573
00:48:42,352 --> 00:48:44,650
I came out during interval
to smoke a cigarette,

574
00:48:44,855 --> 00:48:49,019
I fell down to break my leg and hand.

575
00:48:49,226 --> 00:48:49,954
Stop!

576
00:48:50,928 --> 00:48:55,729
You fell outside the theatre
and got hurt so badly.

577
00:48:56,033 --> 00:48:57,898
You're saying as if you fell
from the first floor.

578
00:48:58,302 --> 00:49:01,237
Had I fallen from first floor I wouldn't
have got hurt so badly,

579
00:49:01,638 --> 00:49:05,836
I fell from a running bus.

580
00:49:06,343 --> 00:49:09,073
- I didn't get you.
- Didn't get me?

581
00:49:09,379 --> 00:49:11,847
I was watching a film in a bus.

582
00:49:14,818 --> 00:49:20,154
Only after falling down, I realised
I was the only one to come out.

583
00:49:24,494 --> 00:49:29,261
I'm serious and you're laughing
like PS Veerappa.

584
00:49:29,499 --> 00:49:30,488
Oh Ghost!

585
00:49:31,468 --> 00:49:32,332
Who is that?

586
00:49:35,372 --> 00:49:36,498
Same car...

587
00:49:38,342 --> 00:49:39,331
same girl.

588
00:49:41,311 --> 00:49:42,471
Same make up.

589
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:46,512
Hi! Hello!

590
00:49:47,517 --> 00:49:49,007
Same U-turn.

591
00:49:49,219 --> 00:49:50,948
Why is she coming quite often?

592
00:49:51,388 --> 00:49:53,856
O Mother sea!
Please accept this destitute girl!

593
00:49:57,327 --> 00:49:58,351
Same suicide!

594
00:49:58,528 --> 00:50:00,519
She's committing the
same suicide again.

595
00:50:00,731 --> 00:50:04,258
Sura, save her. Poor girl!

596
00:50:04,468 --> 00:50:05,526
What are you searching?

597
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:09,029
- Stick! Why?
- Do I need to save her?

598
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:12,865
Already I'm badly hurt,
please don't beat me.

599
00:50:13,076 --> 00:50:15,476
Last time when I saved her,
she asked me why did I save her?

600
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:16,202
Are you playing fun with me?

601
00:50:16,413 --> 00:50:17,505
If you can't do it,
allow me to save her.

602
00:50:17,714 --> 00:50:20,581
Go... go... save her... go.

603
00:50:20,784 --> 00:50:24,151
I'll go but you may've to carry
two bodies, listen to me.

604
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:27,756
You can beat me anytime,
I'm giving you blanket permission.

605
00:50:27,958 --> 00:50:29,084
But please save her first.

606
00:50:29,292 --> 00:50:32,090
She's going to die... die...
Go!

607
00:50:32,295 --> 00:50:35,822
You can beat me at any time,
I'm here only. Go... go...

608
00:50:38,535 --> 00:50:40,901
Hello... hello... stop I say!

609
00:50:41,238 --> 00:50:43,502
Please leave me... leave me...
I don't want to live.

610
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:47,905
Wait! Why?
Has Ramesh ditched you again?

611
00:50:48,211 --> 00:50:49,906
- No.
- Then what?

612
00:50:51,181 --> 00:50:55,675
I love a boy but don't know
if he loves me or not.

613
00:50:55,886 --> 00:50:56,784
That's why.

614
00:50:56,987 --> 00:50:59,353
Did you express your love to him?

615
00:50:59,556 --> 00:51:01,421
Oh no! I forgot that.

616
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:04,793
Mad girl! Go and express
your love first to him.

617
00:51:04,995 --> 00:51:06,519
If he refuses then you
can jump into the sea.

618
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:09,130
Then, I'll tell him right now.
Sura, I love you!

619
00:51:20,043 --> 00:51:22,375
Did I say anything wrong?

620
00:51:24,748 --> 00:51:27,649
Do you love someone else?

621
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:33,951
You're not making
any fun of me, right?

622
00:51:34,357 --> 00:51:38,953
- You'd seen me twice, how can...
- How am I to tell?

623
00:51:41,131 --> 00:51:46,194
You fit perfectly all the qualities
I expect in my husband.

624
00:51:48,038 --> 00:51:52,270
You look like a little girl adamant
to buy an ice cream.

625
00:51:52,976 --> 00:51:54,671
- You don't know my situation...
- I can understand.

626
00:51:55,245 --> 00:51:58,681
You're rich, I'm a poor fisherman.
That's your problem, right?

627
00:52:00,851 --> 00:52:01,647
What else?

628
00:52:03,453 --> 00:52:05,785
Are you expecting any trouble
from my parents?

629
00:52:05,989 --> 00:52:09,823
You needn't worry about my father,
he's just a dummy.

630
00:52:11,428 --> 00:52:13,828
He'll never say no to me.

631
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:18,662
Look, that's not my problem.

632
00:52:19,336 --> 00:52:20,769
You can't understand even if I tell.

633
00:52:21,805 --> 00:52:22,430
Go!

634
00:52:24,741 --> 00:52:25,935
Go I say!

635
00:52:29,713 --> 00:52:32,011
Where did he go away with her?

636
00:52:32,449 --> 00:52:36,351
Has he gone beyond the sea?
Can't make any guess?

637
00:52:37,687 --> 00:52:39,279
Why have you come alone?

638
00:52:39,489 --> 00:52:42,583
- I want to settle a deal with you.
- What's it?

639
00:52:43,593 --> 00:52:46,619
I opened my heart to your friend.

640
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:48,161
Who asked you this now?

641
00:52:48,498 --> 00:52:51,626
- Wait, why are you so excited, boy?
- Boy?

642
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:55,327
No:15, 9th cross street,
Raja Annamalaipuram.

643
00:52:55,539 --> 00:52:58,372
What are you trying to say?
That's my house address.

644
00:52:59,209 --> 00:53:06,047
Your friend must say I love you
to me by midnight today,

645
00:53:06,516 --> 00:53:10,885
if I don't get that reply by midnight,
I'll do what I ought to after a minute.

646
00:53:11,087 --> 00:53:12,486
What's that?

647
00:53:12,923 --> 00:53:15,721
I'll not to the sea,
this is very far,

648
00:53:16,426 --> 00:53:17,893
I'll commit suicide in my home.

649
00:53:19,329 --> 00:53:23,322
Go ahead do it, it's better at home
than coming so far to torture us.

650
00:53:23,533 --> 00:53:25,023
Why are you telling me this?

651
00:53:25,235 --> 00:53:27,294
- I've a reason.
- What's that?

652
00:53:27,504 --> 00:53:34,103
I'll leave a 16 page letter accusing
you for my suicide.

653
00:53:35,545 --> 00:53:39,743
I'll beat you, he's responsible for your death,
why will you write my name?

654
00:53:39,950 --> 00:53:44,114
He's very innocent.
You're the best man for such things.

655
00:53:44,721 --> 00:53:46,018
Am I?

656
00:53:46,323 --> 00:53:49,690
I asked him to save you,
now I'll myself drown you in sea.

657
00:53:49,893 --> 00:53:50,917
Be careful.

658
00:53:51,795 --> 00:53:53,092
You're talking too much.

659
00:53:54,030 --> 00:53:56,863
It's your duty to bring him to me.

660
00:53:57,067 --> 00:54:00,867
If not I'll go up and you'll go to jail.

661
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:05,505
16 page letter?

662
00:54:06,209 --> 00:54:10,305
They take life for a half page.

663
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:12,511
She's threatening about
a 16 page letter.

664
00:54:13,950 --> 00:54:15,508
Can my body bear it?

665
00:54:16,286 --> 00:54:20,985
Trouble is coming in a car to the sea,
what am I to do now?

666
00:54:31,668 --> 00:54:34,068
Why are they with dogs like
shepherds with sheep?

667
00:54:36,606 --> 00:54:40,064
What's this?
Dogs and security people.

668
00:54:40,543 --> 00:54:42,135
How can we enter?
Let's go back.

669
00:54:42,646 --> 00:54:44,671
Did I struggle so much
to bring you for this?

670
00:54:44,881 --> 00:54:46,974
If we go back,
that poor girl may die.

671
00:54:47,217 --> 00:54:48,741
They may kill us before that happens.

672
00:54:48,952 --> 00:54:53,252
Wait... wait... I'll take you
to the other side, trust me.

673
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:57,817
- Trusting you?
- Trust me. Come... go.

674
00:54:58,228 --> 00:54:59,559
What's this?
You say come and then go.

675
00:54:59,763 --> 00:55:00,457
Shall I come or go?

676
00:55:00,664 --> 00:55:03,394
I told you to go that side... come.

677
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:06,293
Why? Go!

678
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:10,098
Look, how I put the ladder
like Pamban bridge.

679
00:55:11,541 --> 00:55:13,270
Go up the ladder fast.

680
00:55:14,544 --> 00:55:15,442
What's it?

681
00:55:16,579 --> 00:55:17,375
What happened?

682
00:55:18,882 --> 00:55:21,612
- I'm very proud of you.
- Why?

683
00:55:21,818 --> 00:55:25,117
How much you're struggling
to save a girl's life?

684
00:55:25,322 --> 00:55:28,120
Thank God, you've realised it now.
Go now.

685
00:55:28,325 --> 00:55:29,189
Getting late to save her.

686
00:55:31,261 --> 00:55:31,955
Go!

687
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:36,526
What? What's it now?

688
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:38,761
I'm very proud of you.

689
00:55:39,569 --> 00:55:42,299
- To save a girl's life...
- Okay, you go in fast.

690
00:55:42,505 --> 00:55:44,473
- Quick, just 5 more minutes only.
- Yes.

691
00:55:44,674 --> 00:55:45,470
Go... go.

692
00:55:48,912 --> 00:55:49,879
What's it now?

693
00:55:51,481 --> 00:55:52,812
I'm very proud of you.

694
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:54,946
No need of all that, you go in first.

695
00:55:55,151 --> 00:55:57,312
Go... go... go...

696
00:55:59,823 --> 00:56:03,486
Go... go... go... go...

697
00:56:21,778 --> 00:56:22,574
Remove the noose.

698
00:56:23,513 --> 00:56:24,980
Don't interfere in my life.

699
00:56:25,181 --> 00:56:26,808
You don't have life,
how can I interfere in it?

700
00:56:27,016 --> 00:56:28,643
Hereafter I will trouble your life.

701
00:56:28,852 --> 00:56:30,513
- Why did you beat me now?
- Look there!

702
00:56:32,021 --> 00:56:32,953
Hi!

703
00:56:35,191 --> 00:56:36,123
Hi?

704
00:56:36,493 --> 00:56:40,486
You threatened about suicide
before midnight with Umbrella,

705
00:56:40,830 --> 00:56:42,730
are you watching TV happily here?

706
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:46,198
Trust me, I've decided to
commit suicide.

707
00:56:46,803 --> 00:56:48,930
Look, I'm prepared with make up too.

708
00:56:56,679 --> 00:57:01,776
It's okay to keep rope, poison, knife,
and sleeping pills for suicide,

709
00:57:02,819 --> 00:57:04,946
- what's that in the cup?
- Sugar!

710
00:57:05,221 --> 00:57:12,992
I always have sugar before
taking any bitter tablet.

711
00:57:13,196 --> 00:57:13,890
That's why...

712
00:57:18,868 --> 00:57:27,139
Not only that I'm watching all the
scenes of suicide from various films.

713
00:57:27,544 --> 00:57:28,806
What are you waiting for then?

714
00:57:29,813 --> 00:57:30,837
Why not begin it?

715
00:57:31,047 --> 00:57:34,813
Just now I called my friend
and I told her about this.

716
00:57:35,018 --> 00:57:40,149
She said boys aren't like in olden times,
they have become very smart.

717
00:57:40,623 --> 00:57:42,614
She said we must take little risk.

718
00:57:43,159 --> 00:57:44,751
I too pondered over it.

719
00:57:45,261 --> 00:57:47,286
If that's for ordinary man,

720
00:57:47,497 --> 00:57:52,127
isn't it little difficult to make a super man
like you to fall in love, right?

721
00:57:52,569 --> 00:57:55,265
So I cancelled the suicide program.

722
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:59,670
I was thinking about
my next attack.

723
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:08,280
That thing?

724
00:58:08,985 --> 00:58:13,945
Poor Ramesh!
He can't live without me.

725
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:16,758
That's why same set up for him too.

726
00:58:24,834 --> 00:58:26,961
A poor little dog...

727
00:59:18,688 --> 00:59:22,749
Winged moon has joined
hands with me...

728
00:59:23,459 --> 00:59:27,623
I gave myself to you at sight...

729
00:59:28,231 --> 00:59:32,759
We want an earth
exclusive for us only...

730
00:59:32,969 --> 00:59:37,463
Want love God to guard us...

731
00:59:37,674 --> 00:59:41,838
Winged moon has joined
hands with me...

732
00:59:42,478 --> 00:59:46,539
I gave myself to you at sight...

733
00:59:47,216 --> 00:59:51,710
We want an earth
exclusive for us only...

734
00:59:51,955 --> 00:59:56,949
Want love God to guard us...

735
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:48,836
It's your fragrance
all over my home...

736
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:58,346
It's your fragrance
all over my home...

737
01:00:58,554 --> 01:01:03,116
With whose permission
did you enter my heart?

738
01:01:03,326 --> 01:01:07,854
My love is after you...

739
01:01:08,064 --> 01:01:12,626
My heart is in your lap...

740
01:01:12,835 --> 01:01:17,363
You're a jasmine hot like sun...

741
01:01:17,573 --> 01:01:22,135
You're cool like moon...

742
01:01:22,345 --> 01:01:26,372
Winged moon has joined
hands with me...

743
01:01:27,083 --> 01:01:31,315
I gave myself to you at sight...

744
01:02:05,121 --> 01:02:09,751
My heart wishes to soar
beyond the sky...

745
01:02:14,597 --> 01:02:19,091
My heart wishes to soar
beyond the sky...

746
01:02:19,402 --> 01:02:24,032
I've started liking your
beautiful mistakes too...

747
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:28,700
My heart is jumping like a child...

748
01:02:28,911 --> 01:02:33,439
It's throwing tantrums
making wild wishes...

749
01:02:33,649 --> 01:02:38,177
Make a list of it, I'll give it...

750
01:02:38,387 --> 01:02:43,017
All I wish is only you...

751
01:02:43,226 --> 01:02:47,458
Winged moon has joined
hands with me...

752
01:02:47,930 --> 01:02:52,230
I gave myself to you at sight...

753
01:02:52,802 --> 01:02:57,262
You're a golden girl with
most beautiful smile...

754
01:02:57,473 --> 01:03:02,308
You're the most handsome man
many women desire...

755
01:03:11,387 --> 01:03:12,581
- Bye!
- Bye.

756
01:03:12,789 --> 01:03:13,915
- Take care.
- Ta... Ta...

757
01:03:14,957 --> 01:03:15,582
Ta... ta...

758
01:03:22,064 --> 01:03:22,758
What?

759
01:03:22,965 --> 01:03:28,028
Umbrella, who came with me,
where is he now?

760
01:03:29,739 --> 01:03:30,603
What's that noise?

761
01:03:30,973 --> 01:03:34,534
They say incident, right?
I think it's happening.

762
01:03:34,744 --> 01:03:39,044
I'll take care of the incident,
you go to sleep. Bye.

763
01:03:39,882 --> 01:03:41,440
- Beat him...
- Tell me...

764
01:03:41,651 --> 01:03:45,280
How dare to use a ladder
to enter home?

765
01:03:45,488 --> 01:03:46,955
Sir please know the reason
and then beat me.

766
01:03:47,156 --> 01:03:48,714
Why did you enter, tell me?

767
01:03:48,925 --> 01:03:51,951
- Brother, please don't beat him.
- Why are you here at this hour?

768
01:03:52,161 --> 01:03:54,721
- Brother, he's our Umbrella.
- Our Umbrella!

769
01:03:54,931 --> 01:03:56,626
What is he doing with
a ladder here?

770
01:03:56,899 --> 01:04:00,460
We came here to paint last night,
we forgot and left it here.

771
01:04:01,103 --> 01:04:03,628
Came to paint?
Painting isn't your profession, right?

772
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:05,967
- That's our side business.
- Yes

773
01:04:06,175 --> 01:04:08,643
Okay, take your ladder
and leave the place.

774
01:04:08,845 --> 01:04:12,804
If I see you again with ladder,
I'll thrash you. I'll finish you.

775
01:04:15,751 --> 01:04:17,378
- Please come.
- Greetings sir.

776
01:04:17,753 --> 01:04:20,153
- Greetings to all of you.
- Greetings sir.

777
01:04:20,356 --> 01:04:21,550
Have sweets sir.

778
01:04:22,692 --> 01:04:23,317
What's the matter?

779
01:04:23,526 --> 01:04:26,324
You said the land deal is settled.
Celebrating it.

780
01:04:26,863 --> 01:04:27,830
Please sit down.

781
01:04:29,632 --> 01:04:30,929
You too have a sweet.

782
01:04:36,038 --> 01:04:39,599
When will you vacate the hamlet?
How will you vacate it?

783
01:04:39,876 --> 01:04:42,174
It's not a big deal to
vacate the hamlet.

784
01:04:42,745 --> 01:04:45,680
- But there's a small problem.
- What's it?

785
01:04:46,048 --> 01:04:47,845
When did your father bought that land?

786
01:04:48,050 --> 01:04:50,018
1958!

787
01:04:50,386 --> 01:04:54,948
But my father bought the
same land in 1948 itself!

788
01:05:02,131 --> 01:05:08,866
You created fake documents for govt. Land
and paid me bribe to vacate the land.

789
01:05:13,743 --> 01:05:16,871
Can't I create fake documents?

790
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:20,048
Have you gone dumb, Reddy?

791
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:28,050
No need to fight between us.
Let's share it equally.

792
01:05:28,691 --> 01:05:29,658
50-50!

793
01:05:30,426 --> 01:05:32,053
Reddy, I've a very bad habit.

794
01:05:32,762 --> 01:05:37,062
If I don't like a thing,
I'll give it fully.

795
01:05:37,833 --> 01:05:42,497
But if I like it, I'll have it fully.

796
01:05:43,172 --> 01:05:47,233
I don't like sharing.

797
01:05:47,443 --> 01:05:49,001
What's this sir?

798
01:05:49,278 --> 01:05:52,247
We gave you sweet,
are you kicking us on back?

799
01:05:52,782 --> 01:05:55,580
Samudram, you're doing a mistake.

800
01:05:55,885 --> 01:05:57,352
I'll not leave it here.

801
01:05:57,954 --> 01:05:59,819
I came to you because
this is your area.

802
01:06:00,022 --> 01:06:03,822
I'll meet higher than you.
I know many Central Ministers.

803
01:06:04,527 --> 01:06:06,017
I know all the goons.

804
01:06:12,468 --> 01:06:15,437
Save me!

805
01:06:18,908 --> 01:06:20,603
Water... water...

806
01:06:27,817 --> 01:06:28,943
Bring it.

807
01:06:30,519 --> 01:06:32,453
Water... water...

808
01:06:33,889 --> 01:06:34,617
Water...

809
01:06:50,673 --> 01:06:59,980
If I take that place, I know how you
can trouble me with your reach.

810
01:07:00,683 --> 01:07:07,316
So I gave you coffee laced
with cyanide.

811
01:07:32,548 --> 01:07:35,278
Big realtors from Andhra killed
in a car accident.

812
01:07:41,490 --> 01:07:46,189
I'll build the theme park
dreamt by Reddy.

813
01:07:54,570 --> 01:07:57,937
Reddy gave us millions of rupees.

814
01:07:59,642 --> 01:08:02,873
We must clean up the hamlet
as soon as possible.

815
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:04,478
That's not a big deal.

816
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:08,548
They are all struggling for daily existence
fighting rough seas every day.

817
01:08:09,185 --> 01:08:14,054
If we show them few thousands of bucks,
they will vacate the place.

818
01:08:14,757 --> 01:08:15,883
It isn't as easy as that.

819
01:08:17,493 --> 01:08:18,391
Why do you think so?

820
01:08:18,761 --> 01:08:20,956
There's a man Sura in this hamlet.

821
01:08:22,298 --> 01:08:23,060
Sura?

822
01:08:24,934 --> 01:08:29,064
- People listen to him only.
- Is he the leader of the hamlet?

823
01:08:29,271 --> 01:08:34,072
He doesn't claim himself as leader
but people see him as their leader.

824
01:08:34,276 --> 01:08:40,408
Any one who is famous in his street wants
his name written all over the lane.

825
01:08:41,117 --> 01:08:47,920
And as if they've found the cell phone,
keep flex banners with it all over.

826
01:08:48,124 --> 01:08:51,184
But you say Sura is their leader,
I don't even know his name.

827
01:08:52,128 --> 01:08:54,426
You can never see the roots
and foundation.

828
01:08:54,630 --> 01:08:57,861
His name may not be on walls,
posters may not bear his name,

829
01:08:58,134 --> 01:09:02,093
but everyone in this hamlet has
his image tattooed in their hearts.

830
01:09:02,304 --> 01:09:04,204
You must be very careful
in handling him.

831
01:09:04,573 --> 01:09:09,010
Instead of speaking individuals,
it's easy to speak with him only.

832
01:09:10,479 --> 01:09:15,439
No, if he doesn't accept our deal,
as Reddy said if he goes to the court,

833
01:09:15,651 --> 01:09:17,619
matter will reach people with
media pouncing on it.

834
01:09:18,154 --> 01:09:21,214
Matter must be secret till the
land comes into our possession.

835
01:09:22,925 --> 01:09:24,950
What are you thinking?

836
01:09:26,195 --> 01:09:29,722
What if the house is locked
and we lose the keys?

837
01:09:30,332 --> 01:09:31,629
What will you do enter the home?

838
01:09:32,501 --> 01:09:33,468
Break open the lock.

839
01:09:34,336 --> 01:09:35,132
Break it.

840
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:40,138
Umbrella! Our guy!

841
01:09:40,342 --> 01:09:43,971
Oh God! I've had enough from her.

842
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:45,704
She has come to market for me.

843
01:09:45,915 --> 01:09:47,746
Don't know what is she planning
for me now?

844
01:09:50,519 --> 01:09:51,747
Why are you after me?

845
01:09:52,054 --> 01:09:58,653
I asked a boy about Sura's house.
He said ask Umbrella.

846
01:09:59,195 --> 01:10:00,492
- That's why...
- Stop it.

847
01:10:00,963 --> 01:10:03,329
No need to ask me,
ask his mother.

848
01:10:04,033 --> 01:10:06,501
- Where is his mother?
- She's selling fish there, ask her.

849
01:10:07,203 --> 01:10:11,503
- Come and show me.
- Don't pull a man by his shirt.

850
01:10:11,707 --> 01:10:13,004
Come and show me
who is his mother.

851
01:10:13,409 --> 01:10:15,343
The lady sitting there is
his mother. Meet her.

852
01:10:15,778 --> 01:10:18,679
She? Then say she's
my mother-in-law.

853
01:10:18,881 --> 01:10:19,745
You're going overboard.

854
01:10:20,182 --> 01:10:23,447
Love ghost has taken over you.
It's not good for your health.

855
01:10:23,786 --> 01:10:26,516
I don't want to talk to you,
I'll talk with my mother-in-law.

856
01:10:29,658 --> 01:10:32,183
Looks like she'll have two kids
before marriage,

857
01:10:32,394 --> 01:10:35,192
and make her old granny.
I'll not let it happen.

858
01:10:35,531 --> 01:10:38,364
- Mother-in-law!
- Mother-in-law?

859
01:10:38,567 --> 01:10:39,192
Yes, she says mother-in-law.

860
01:10:39,401 --> 01:10:42,859
She's like a golden doll and
is calling me as mother-in-law,

861
01:10:43,072 --> 01:10:44,039
who is she?

862
01:10:44,506 --> 01:10:48,203
Your son and she are dating.

863
01:10:48,544 --> 01:10:49,533
What does it mean?

864
01:10:50,012 --> 01:10:53,209
- She loves your son.
- Love?

865
01:10:53,749 --> 01:10:56,217
- Not only that...
- Enough of it.

866
01:10:57,586 --> 01:10:58,484
God bless you.

867
01:10:58,687 --> 01:10:59,711
What's your name?

868
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:08,389
I'll kill you!
How dare you fall on me.

869
01:11:08,597 --> 01:11:09,894
I'll make juice of you.

870
01:11:10,532 --> 01:11:11,897
What had happened now?

871
01:11:12,935 --> 01:11:14,232
Why is she here?

872
01:11:14,436 --> 01:11:16,063
What is she saying with my mother?

873
01:11:39,528 --> 01:11:40,085
Mother!

874
01:11:43,399 --> 01:11:44,366
Mother! Mother!

875
01:11:48,137 --> 01:11:50,367
- Mother...
- Mother-in-law!

876
01:11:50,973 --> 01:11:53,271
- Mother!
- Mother-in-law!

877
01:11:58,147 --> 01:11:58,613
Mother!

878
01:12:05,387 --> 01:12:08,618
- Take mother to hospital.
- No son.

879
01:12:08,824 --> 01:12:10,621
- Go... go... mother.
- Come, mother-in-law.

880
01:13:31,673 --> 01:13:33,800
Who are you guys?

881
01:14:14,016 --> 01:14:17,247
Who sent you?
Who sent you?

882
01:15:46,041 --> 01:15:47,440
What happened? Who beat them?

883
01:15:47,643 --> 01:15:48,837
Are you asking about that, doctor?

884
01:15:49,311 --> 01:15:52,747
Two women! Huge in size!

885
01:15:53,048 --> 01:15:55,516
They knocked down and
bashed me up.

886
01:15:55,984 --> 01:15:59,852
Highlight is each woman weighs
more than 100 kgs.

887
01:16:00,055 --> 01:16:02,114
What nonsense?
What is he blabbering?

888
01:16:02,391 --> 01:16:05,121
Sorry doctor, that's his
personal matter, you go out.

889
01:16:05,327 --> 01:16:07,522
I'll not go, I'll answer
his question.

890
01:16:07,896 --> 01:16:09,796
Will you go out or shall I get you
a shot of poisonous injection?

891
01:16:10,732 --> 01:16:11,858
Poisonous injection?

892
01:16:13,068 --> 01:16:13,534
Out!

893
01:16:14,736 --> 01:16:19,366
Will you kill me with a poison
injection for telling the truth?

894
01:16:19,908 --> 01:16:22,206
- What a world this is!
- How is my mother?

895
01:16:22,411 --> 01:16:24,538
Get lost! Irritating me!

896
01:16:30,852 --> 01:16:32,319
Are you fine, mother?

897
01:16:32,521 --> 01:16:34,648
I'm fine, son.
Are you okay, son?

898
01:16:35,257 --> 01:16:37,817
Who are they?
What's the problem with them?

899
01:16:39,595 --> 01:16:41,222
I too don't know mother.

900
01:16:41,863 --> 01:16:44,991
May be they came for another man
and mistaken you for him...

901
01:16:46,268 --> 01:16:47,496
I don't think so.

902
01:16:48,036 --> 01:16:50,061
I felt they came for me only.

903
01:16:50,272 --> 01:16:54,333
You wish good for everyone,
who is against you?

904
01:16:57,613 --> 01:16:59,911
I never saw these
guys earlier, mother.

905
01:17:01,116 --> 01:17:04,017
I wanted to catch one
and get information,

906
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:07,345
but all them just vanished.

907
01:17:10,726 --> 01:17:13,024
Thank God, I was to
go to identify him.

908
01:17:13,795 --> 01:17:16,093
What's our next plan, brother?

909
01:17:16,298 --> 01:17:19,165
Next plan? He has sent all our henchmen
on retirement in one shot.

910
01:17:19,368 --> 01:17:21,700
Now we've to advertise for
new henchmen to get thrashed.

911
01:17:25,407 --> 01:17:27,432
- Settle their accounts.
- Okay.

912
01:17:27,909 --> 01:17:31,868
Come... come...
take money and go home.

913
01:17:32,881 --> 01:17:36,612
No use to fight him anymore.

914
01:17:37,486 --> 01:17:38,953
He would've got alerted by now.

915
01:17:41,089 --> 01:17:42,784
Now we must deal it
in a different way.

916
01:18:11,319 --> 01:18:14,186
Bay of Bengal is my boundary...
I'm a lion cub...

917
01:18:14,389 --> 01:18:17,187
I'll pounce, don't tease me...

918
01:18:17,392 --> 01:18:20,190
We are colourful girls...
we are a garden of desires...

919
01:18:20,395 --> 01:18:23,387
Shall we play a game of dice?

920
01:18:23,598 --> 01:18:29,195
You're tempting like the
fragrance of sandalwood...

921
01:18:29,571 --> 01:18:35,100
Young maiden has come off age,
come and sprinkle turmeric water...

922
01:18:35,310 --> 01:18:41,215
Don't try to trap me...
don't look at me eagerly...

923
01:18:41,416 --> 01:18:47,218
Have a blast, my sweetheart...
spread you magic on me...

924
01:18:47,422 --> 01:18:50,118
Bay of Bengal is my boundary...
I'm a lion cub...

925
01:18:50,325 --> 01:18:53,226
I'll pounce, don't tease me...

926
01:18:53,428 --> 01:18:56,158
We are colourful girls...
we are a garden of desires...

927
01:18:56,364 --> 01:18:59,629
Shall we play a game of dice?

928
01:19:48,216 --> 01:19:52,676
You're smart,
shall I outsmart you?

929
01:19:52,888 --> 01:19:58,758
Hey girl! There's no one here
to outsmart me...

930
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:02,987
O handsome! You're hot...
you're suave...

931
01:20:03,198 --> 01:20:05,962
I'm all yours...

932
01:20:06,168 --> 01:20:11,970
O beauty! I'm an angry rogue...
don't invite sun at night...

933
01:20:12,174 --> 01:20:17,976
Get paid for having fun...
no-holds-barred pure fun...

934
01:20:18,547 --> 01:20:23,746
Hey stinging bee with desire...
it's late night, go home...

935
01:20:24,286 --> 01:20:29,986
Come to the mango grove...
bunches are hanging, have a go...

936
01:20:30,192 --> 01:20:32,990
Don't bite more than
you can chew...

937
01:20:33,195 --> 01:20:35,993
I'm a shark, you can't catch
it so easily...

938
01:20:36,198 --> 01:20:38,996
Bay of Bengal is my boundary...
I'm a lion cub...

939
01:20:39,201 --> 01:20:42,068
I'll pounce, don't tease me...

940
01:20:42,270 --> 01:20:45,000
We are colourful girls...
we are a garden of desires...

941
01:20:45,207 --> 01:20:48,404
Shall we play a game of dice?

942
01:21:27,282 --> 01:21:31,844
Hey boatman! May I spread
silk bed for you...

943
01:21:32,053 --> 01:21:37,787
No need... I've a partner
to share my mat...

944
01:21:37,993 --> 01:21:39,119
Have me, beau...

945
01:21:39,327 --> 01:21:42,125
New desires...
hitting like a cyclone...

946
01:21:42,330 --> 01:21:45,060
Put a speed breaker
to the speed...

947
01:21:45,267 --> 01:21:48,100
Hey you maiden!
Where's your half sari?

948
01:21:48,303 --> 01:21:51,067
Try someone else for that...

949
01:21:51,273 --> 01:21:56,870
Crush me in your bear hug, O man...

950
01:21:57,512 --> 01:22:03,075
Trying to trap me...
can't tolerate your advances...

951
01:22:03,285 --> 01:22:09,190
I've seen many men but
only touched my heart...

952
01:22:09,391 --> 01:22:12,087
Hey deer! You've come
jumping the fence...

953
01:22:12,294 --> 01:22:15,161
I'm a man who lives by rules...

954
01:22:15,363 --> 01:22:21,131
Have a blast, my sweetheart...
spread you magic on me...

955
01:22:21,336 --> 01:22:27,673
Don't try to trap me...
don't look at me eagerly...

956
01:22:30,178 --> 01:22:31,270
Okay, bye.

957
01:22:56,838 --> 01:22:58,806
Throw him!

958
01:23:15,256 --> 01:23:16,188
Pour and burn it down.

959
01:23:24,199 --> 01:23:27,930
Huts are on fire! Come here!

960
01:23:28,970 --> 01:23:32,531
My hut is burning!

961
01:23:43,985 --> 01:23:48,479
Get water... douse the fire...

962
01:23:51,559 --> 01:23:54,551
My house is burning! Sura!

963
01:24:02,437 --> 01:24:05,998
Women leave the place,
we'll take care of it.

964
01:24:42,310 --> 01:24:44,676
- It could be our Sura!
- No way!

965
01:24:44,879 --> 01:24:48,280
- I'll not believe it, he's not Sura.
- By now he would've got charred.

966
01:25:25,420 --> 01:25:29,720
Wait... wait... please be calm...

967
01:25:29,924 --> 01:25:31,551
Constable, tell them to stand away.

968
01:25:31,759 --> 01:25:35,695
Sir, we lost everything we had.

969
01:25:35,897 --> 01:25:40,061
They used crackers for the festival
and it burnt down the huts, sir.

970
01:25:41,836 --> 01:25:43,804
You never burn crackers carefully.

971
01:25:44,405 --> 01:25:47,397
Did you see it's affect?
I'm getting choked.

972
01:25:48,042 --> 01:25:49,304
What's this, Dhandapani?

973
01:25:50,345 --> 01:25:57,274
We are on streets with
wife and kids, sir.

974
01:25:57,485 --> 01:26:00,682
Sura was the only support we had.

975
01:26:00,889 --> 01:26:03,153
We've lost him also to the fire.

976
01:26:04,092 --> 01:26:08,756
- You must help us sir.
- Yes, you must.

977
01:26:09,330 --> 01:26:10,661
What have you planned?

978
01:26:11,132 --> 01:26:13,498
Few people can be accommodated
in schools or function halls,

979
01:26:13,701 --> 01:26:17,398
all the huts are reduced to ashes,
thousands have been affected,

980
01:26:17,605 --> 01:26:18,833
we are still discussing
about their rehabilitation.

981
01:26:19,040 --> 01:26:22,168
Sir, rains will start in a day or two.

982
01:26:22,410 --> 01:26:23,843
Situation will turn worse.

983
01:26:24,312 --> 01:26:25,609
You must take immediate action.

984
01:26:29,050 --> 01:26:30,915
Listen to me carefully.

985
01:26:31,119 --> 01:26:34,316
I own 10 acres of land near Maruvathur.

986
01:26:34,522 --> 01:26:37,013
I'll give it free of cost to you.

987
01:26:37,325 --> 01:26:41,284
I'll give Rs.10000 to each family
to put a hut there.

988
01:26:41,496 --> 01:26:47,366
I'll arrange your stay and food
for tonight in my marriage hall.

989
01:26:49,737 --> 01:26:51,261
What's your opinion?

990
01:26:51,472 --> 01:26:52,564
Discuss and take a decision.

991
01:26:52,774 --> 01:26:58,076
Till now we had Sura and
we followed him,

992
01:26:58,279 --> 01:27:00,270
Sura is no more with us,

993
01:27:00,481 --> 01:27:04,884
we don't have any other way
than to listen to him.

994
01:27:05,086 --> 01:27:08,385
Thank you very much sir.
May God bless you sir.

995
01:27:09,190 --> 01:27:13,320
Why are you silent, Dhandapani?
Arrange for their stay.

996
01:27:18,566 --> 01:27:20,761
Come... come quickly.

997
01:27:21,603 --> 01:27:23,230
Come... come...

998
01:27:23,871 --> 01:27:24,735
Come quickly.

999
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:26,673
Come fast with kid.

1000
01:27:26,874 --> 01:27:28,899
Those who have taken leave
the place quickly.

1001
01:27:31,946 --> 01:27:36,383
I'll not believe...
my son is not dead.

1002
01:28:03,111 --> 01:28:08,378
Killing the mighty who
torment the poor...

1003
01:28:09,484 --> 01:28:15,389
God who protects justice and law...

1004
01:28:15,990 --> 01:28:18,959
Killing the mighty who
torment the poor...

1005
01:28:19,160 --> 01:28:22,220
God who protects justice and law...

1006
01:28:22,430 --> 01:28:35,742
God who protects...

1007
01:28:54,796 --> 01:29:00,098
Standing by the destitute...

1008
01:29:00,768 --> 01:29:06,400
Our family deity who wipes our tears...

1009
01:29:07,675 --> 01:29:10,644
Standing by the destitute...

1010
01:29:10,845 --> 01:29:13,871
Our family deity who wipes our tears...

1011
01:29:14,082 --> 01:29:28,361
Our family deity...

1012
01:29:28,563 --> 01:29:39,303
Our family deity...

1013
01:29:39,507 --> 01:29:41,907
I was worried about you, son.

1014
01:29:42,510 --> 01:29:45,035
I'm fine, mother.

1015
01:29:45,747 --> 01:29:49,046
You said you killed him.

1016
01:29:49,851 --> 01:29:52,376
He has come like
Phoenix from the ashes.

1017
01:29:53,287 --> 01:29:54,686
That's what I'm also confused.

1018
01:29:56,090 --> 01:29:58,524
He's coming back from
death everytime.

1019
01:29:58,726 --> 01:30:00,421
Did you see our hamlet, Sura?

1020
01:30:00,962 --> 01:30:03,658
Where were you till now?

1021
01:30:05,867 --> 01:30:08,700
I'll tell you what had happened
to me or where was I?

1022
01:30:10,805 --> 01:30:11,829
Where are you all going?

1023
01:30:12,039 --> 01:30:13,802
Our hamlet is reduced to ashes,

1024
01:30:14,008 --> 01:30:19,207
Minister has generously given land
in Maruvathur next to Tindivanam,

1025
01:30:19,414 --> 01:30:22,076
and gave Rs.10000 to
build new huts.

1026
01:30:25,319 --> 01:30:28,015
What else do you know
other than fishing?

1027
01:30:33,561 --> 01:30:36,758
Will you come in a car from
Maruvathur to catch fish here?

1028
01:30:37,131 --> 01:30:40,123
He's adding fuel to the dying fire.

1029
01:30:40,802 --> 01:30:42,702
Okay, but what about the
homes to live?

1030
01:30:43,204 --> 01:30:45,604
Do you call what we lived
in as homes?

1031
01:30:46,641 --> 01:30:52,477
Were we living in palatial buildings with
separate rooms to cook, eat and sleep?

1032
01:30:52,847 --> 01:30:55,213
Can't even stretch fully
inside our huts?

1033
01:30:56,751 --> 01:30:59,276
Thatched roof, single brick wall
and one room only.

1034
01:30:59,954 --> 01:31:01,387
Can't we build it ourselves?

1035
01:31:02,757 --> 01:31:07,558
How could you leave the place you
were born and brought for Rs.10000?

1036
01:31:07,762 --> 01:31:09,730
Will you take money from anyone?

1037
01:31:11,098 --> 01:31:17,094
Tamils are the ones who talk most about
self-reliance and not follows it practically.

1038
01:31:17,305 --> 01:31:19,500
You were not here,
so we didn't have choice.

1039
01:31:19,707 --> 01:31:22,733
If I'm not here...
can't you live on your own?

1040
01:31:23,277 --> 01:31:26,576
You must live,
your life is your hands.

1041
01:31:26,781 --> 01:31:27,839
You must develop self-confidence.

1042
01:31:28,049 --> 01:31:30,210
Why are you still keeping money?
Return it.

1043
01:31:30,418 --> 01:31:32,978
What are you looking at?
Return their money.

1044
01:31:47,535 --> 01:31:50,368
Minister is calling you.

1045
01:32:12,059 --> 01:32:13,026
Greetings sir.

1046
01:32:18,833 --> 01:32:22,064
I heard you speaking to them.

1047
01:32:23,104 --> 01:32:25,299
You got emotional
while talking to them.

1048
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:34,147
People who have lost everything,
I gave them money and land,

1049
01:32:34,949 --> 01:32:36,541
why are you stopping it?

1050
01:32:38,252 --> 01:32:43,246
If you'd given money and let us build
huts here, we would've accepted.

1051
01:32:44,191 --> 01:32:48,628
But you want us to
vacate this place.

1052
01:32:49,797 --> 01:32:54,734
I don't know what's your intention,
to help us or usurp this place?

1053
01:32:54,936 --> 01:32:55,868
Okay,

1054
01:32:56,871 --> 01:32:58,566
I gave Rs.10000 to all of them,

1055
01:33:01,709 --> 01:33:03,074
what are you expecting?

1056
01:33:06,113 --> 01:33:07,080
Rs. 100 thousands.

1057
01:33:08,583 --> 01:33:09,413
Rs.1 million!

1058
01:33:14,889 --> 01:33:15,913
Rs.10 millions!

1059
01:33:19,393 --> 01:33:23,921
I was having a suspicion,
now it's confirmed.

1060
01:33:25,633 --> 01:33:28,625
You burnt down our hamlet.

1061
01:33:29,036 --> 01:33:30,936
Yes, I did it.

1062
01:33:31,539 --> 01:33:33,871
I want this place.
What do you want?

1063
01:33:38,145 --> 01:33:43,674
You've burnt down an entire village,
and offering money too.

1064
01:33:44,852 --> 01:33:49,619
No man on earth can dare buy me.

1065
01:33:51,959 --> 01:33:54,723
Nobody will believe that
you burnt down the huts.

1066
01:33:55,129 --> 01:33:57,791
Even Police complaint is useless.

1067
01:33:58,766 --> 01:34:03,794
So I've decided to deal
the problem myself.

1068
01:34:04,005 --> 01:34:05,802
Do you know who you're taking on?

1069
01:34:06,173 --> 01:34:10,667
You're up against
an all powerful Minister.

1070
01:34:21,288 --> 01:34:27,090
You may have men, money, power
but I've honesty on my side.

1071
01:34:27,862 --> 01:34:29,261
I've the courage.

1072
01:34:30,131 --> 01:34:35,660
Above all I've followers
who would die for me.

1073
01:34:36,504 --> 01:34:40,838
Once I decide to fight,
I don't care if it's Minister or King.

1074
01:34:42,143 --> 01:34:43,337
I'll take on.

1075
01:34:47,481 --> 01:34:48,880
I'm throwing a challenge,

1076
01:34:49,083 --> 01:34:53,782
I'll build huts for my people
in the same place in 6 months,

1077
01:34:55,356 --> 01:34:58,519
this is not a challenge but a vow!

1078
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:47,991
Tamil... courageous Tamil...

1079
01:36:48,202 --> 01:36:50,227
Leader of Tamils...

1080
01:36:50,437 --> 01:36:54,737
Will stand by the distressed
in times of distress...

1081
01:37:05,719 --> 01:37:09,553
He's like simmering fire...
will break the shackles of slavery...

1082
01:37:09,757 --> 01:37:14,319
If anyone dares steps on his shadow...
he'll strike cataclysm...

1083
01:38:10,017 --> 01:38:16,149
Hey customs! Escape!

1084
01:38:18,092 --> 01:38:19,218
You return fire at them!

1085
01:38:24,765 --> 01:38:26,426
They are firing from all sides, lie down.

1086
01:38:39,446 --> 01:38:40,504
He looks like a new officer.

1087
01:38:52,660 --> 01:38:54,184
They are using rocket launchers too.

1088
01:38:55,729 --> 01:38:57,697
- Don't give them time to recover.
- Okay, brother.

1089
01:38:58,332 --> 01:39:00,300
- Fire all bombs without any break.
- Okay brother.

1090
01:39:06,006 --> 01:39:07,098
They are using a sten gun too.

1091
01:39:07,741 --> 01:39:10,869
If we get caught they will make
us sing about the goods.

1092
01:39:11,078 --> 01:39:12,045
If goods is confiscated,
it'll reach port.

1093
01:39:12,246 --> 01:39:13,975
Minister will manage officers
and release the goods.

1094
01:39:14,181 --> 01:39:16,877
- Let's escape!
- Quick! Jump!

1095
01:39:27,261 --> 01:39:31,220
He'll raise like a volcano...
even enemies will praise him...

1096
01:39:31,532 --> 01:39:35,730
He'll attack like storm
and win the battle...

1097
01:39:35,936 --> 01:39:40,168
He'll win single handedly and
achieve eternal fame...

1098
01:39:40,374 --> 01:39:44,743
He's one of a kind this world
has seen and will see...

1099
01:39:55,556 --> 01:39:57,581
Tamil... courageous Tamil...

1100
01:39:57,791 --> 01:39:59,759
Leader of Tamils...

1101
01:39:59,960 --> 01:40:04,260
Will stand by the distressed
in times of distress...

1102
01:40:07,634 --> 01:40:09,261
Who went on rounds last night?

1103
01:40:09,470 --> 01:40:10,937
We didn't enter the sea at all, sir.

1104
01:40:11,638 --> 01:40:13,162
Who dared to confiscate my goods?

1105
01:40:13,474 --> 01:40:15,442
How can we dare confiscate your goods?

1106
01:40:15,709 --> 01:40:16,937
Trust me sir, we didn't do it.

1107
01:40:20,714 --> 01:40:23,774
It's not brinjals to sell everywhere,
it's laptops.

1108
01:40:23,984 --> 01:40:25,781
It has to come to me.

1109
01:40:25,986 --> 01:40:27,954
I'm sure the goods wouldn't
have left Chennai borders.

1110
01:40:28,155 --> 01:40:29,782
Mumbai

1111
01:40:51,779 --> 01:40:53,076
Let's check it sir.

1112
01:40:54,381 --> 01:40:55,643
Can we check it?

1113
01:41:18,372 --> 01:41:18,997
Okay.

1114
01:42:18,932 --> 01:42:20,832
You've changed completely.

1115
01:42:21,401 --> 01:42:22,629
Whose car is it?

1116
01:42:23,137 --> 01:42:24,627
You'll come to know it.

1117
01:42:26,039 --> 01:42:29,167
- Take chocolates.
- Thanks brother.

1118
01:42:29,376 --> 01:42:31,071
How is my dress, mother?

1119
01:42:31,278 --> 01:42:33,075
Very good, you look like a prince.

1120
01:42:33,780 --> 01:42:36,078
- I've a good news.
- What yeah?

1121
01:42:36,950 --> 01:42:39,350
- Super yeah! Give me hand.
- Thank you.

1122
01:42:40,621 --> 01:42:42,851
We are in for good times.

1123
01:42:43,457 --> 01:42:45,152
We'll be getting new homes shortly.

1124
01:42:45,359 --> 01:42:47,259
- Own homes?
- Yes.

1125
01:42:47,628 --> 01:42:51,086
A home that will not leak in rain
or get burnt in summer.

1126
01:42:51,298 --> 01:42:52,424
I'm losing out.

1127
01:42:52,633 --> 01:42:54,601
Who will build it for us?
Government?

1128
01:42:54,801 --> 01:42:57,326
No... no... we are building it ourselves.

1129
01:42:57,538 --> 01:42:59,870
- I didn't get you.
- Money?

1130
01:43:00,073 --> 01:43:01,870
- My mother gave.
- Me?

1131
01:43:03,443 --> 01:43:07,436
Mother, it's Mother sea,
who gives our livelihood.

1132
01:43:07,648 --> 01:43:12,017
It's a lie, that's my money.
Take out the vehicles.

1133
01:43:15,989 --> 01:43:19,117
- Stop... stop I say...
- Wait.

1134
01:43:19,993 --> 01:43:22,962
What's it dear?
Are you playing with ball?

1135
01:43:23,163 --> 01:43:24,130
Yes daddy.

1136
01:43:25,732 --> 01:43:27,131
Okay, go inside and play.

1137
01:43:27,334 --> 01:43:28,301
- Go... go...
- Come.

1138
01:43:31,405 --> 01:43:32,201
Come on boys!

1139
01:43:34,608 --> 01:43:36,473
All houses must be same.

1140
01:44:08,442 --> 01:44:11,002
He must be alive till money
comes into our hands.

1141
01:44:20,387 --> 01:44:26,189
When you challenged me on that day,
I thought you got emotional.

1142
01:44:26,893 --> 01:44:30,693
But you've proved that I was wrong.

1143
01:44:31,398 --> 01:44:35,198
No problem, return my money.
I'll forgive you.

1144
01:44:35,402 --> 01:44:40,533
Are you Jesus to forgive me?
I'll not return your money.

1145
01:44:40,907 --> 01:44:45,367
You've stolen my money,
is it justified?

1146
01:44:45,579 --> 01:44:48,207
Look, who is talking about justice!

1147
01:44:49,082 --> 01:44:52,381
Stealing from a thief for
necessity is not a crime.

1148
01:44:53,820 --> 01:44:56,721
What are you looking at?
You know this?

1149
01:44:57,658 --> 01:45:00,650
My dream is to build homes
for my people.

1150
01:45:01,461 --> 01:45:04,487
I was thinking about
how to achieve it.

1151
01:45:04,831 --> 01:45:07,732
God is the biggest maths teacher.

1152
01:45:08,268 --> 01:45:12,568
He added, subtracted and
gave the money to me.

1153
01:45:13,006 --> 01:45:14,234
I'll build homes for them now.

1154
01:45:14,441 --> 01:45:18,901
Okay, give me the money,
I'll build your homes.

1155
01:45:19,112 --> 01:45:23,242
You? Build homes for us?
You want me to believe this.

1156
01:45:23,617 --> 01:45:26,745
You're not a gentleman
to keep his word,

1157
01:45:26,953 --> 01:45:30,081
I'm not a salesman to
sell goods and pay you.

1158
01:45:30,957 --> 01:45:34,484
I'll not even give you a rupee
from the Rs.1 billion.

1159
01:45:35,896 --> 01:45:37,591
- Hey you stooge!
- It's me!

1160
01:45:37,964 --> 01:45:41,923
If your ship sinks in
the sea with goods,

1161
01:45:42,703 --> 01:45:43,601
what would you do?

1162
01:45:43,804 --> 01:45:46,932
What would we do?
We'll lament about losing the goods,

1163
01:45:47,140 --> 01:45:49,165
and go on a drinking binge
for 4 days.

1164
01:45:49,376 --> 01:45:53,437
Same thing... go on a drinking binge
for 4 days for losing your goods.

1165
01:45:53,980 --> 01:45:54,776
Go... go...

1166
01:45:54,981 --> 01:45:56,278
How dare you say that!

1167
01:46:02,889 --> 01:46:05,949
When leaders are talking,
sidekicks must keep quiet.

1168
01:46:06,993 --> 01:46:10,793
If you make any noise,
I'll cut your throats.

1169
01:46:11,365 --> 01:46:17,531
Take Rs.1 billion as compensation for
burning our huts and forget it, go now.

1170
01:46:19,172 --> 01:46:23,632
I've never spoken so patiently
with anyone.

1171
01:46:25,112 --> 01:46:29,481
If I get angry, I'll not speak.

1172
01:46:30,784 --> 01:46:32,911
My enemy will get beaten up.

1173
01:46:33,120 --> 01:46:37,819
If you beat, it may hurt,
but if I beat, it's strike of lightning.

1174
01:47:29,843 --> 01:47:38,876
I felt like crushing him under
a road roller when he was talking.

1175
01:47:39,085 --> 01:47:45,388
I can't harm him because he must be
alive till we get back our money.

1176
01:47:46,660 --> 01:47:47,217
Come.

1177
01:47:50,197 --> 01:47:53,064
If he beats you,
you can't sleep for six months...

1178
01:47:55,602 --> 01:47:57,399
He broke my hand, brother.

1179
01:47:58,104 --> 01:48:01,301
He'll beat black and blue
for nothing,

1180
01:48:01,508 --> 01:48:04,170
now he has millions,
he'll thrash you.

1181
01:48:04,544 --> 01:48:07,741
- We must protect ourselves.
- I'll go back to my place.

1182
01:48:07,948 --> 01:48:10,178
If he beats, you've to retire.

1183
01:48:10,383 --> 01:48:12,578
- Go... ticket is ready.
- Okay.

1184
01:48:12,886 --> 01:48:17,755
Today I've earned Rs.2000
selling the fish catch.

1185
01:48:18,625 --> 01:48:22,026
I'm very lucky today.

1186
01:48:23,864 --> 01:48:27,027
If usury lender see this,
he'll take it.

1187
01:48:27,234 --> 01:48:29,998
Better to hide it here.

1188
01:48:31,972 --> 01:48:32,870
Look there!

1189
01:48:35,876 --> 01:48:37,707
Why police is after me?

1190
01:48:39,079 --> 01:48:43,106
- You're under arrest.
- Arrest? I was just walking.

1191
01:48:43,316 --> 01:48:44,442
Though just walking, you came alone.

1192
01:48:44,651 --> 01:48:46,949
- Logic is wrong.
- Don't talk about logic.

1193
01:48:47,153 --> 01:48:47,949
What are you having?

1194
01:48:48,588 --> 01:48:50,681
- Watch, chain, ring...
- You've all this?

1195
01:48:50,924 --> 01:48:52,118
It's pawned with money lender.

1196
01:48:52,325 --> 01:48:54,623
Why are you talking to
him unnecessarily?

1197
01:48:55,896 --> 01:48:56,954
- Give me the baton.
- Take

1198
01:49:02,235 --> 01:49:03,725
- It has fallen down.
- Fallen down?

1199
01:49:04,004 --> 01:49:06,472
- Don't touch.
- Sir, it has money.

1200
01:49:06,673 --> 01:49:07,799
- How much?
- Rs.2000

1201
01:49:08,008 --> 01:49:09,134
- Where did you get it?
- My hard earned money.

1202
01:49:09,342 --> 01:49:10,468
Why did you hide hard earned money?

1203
01:49:10,677 --> 01:49:13,908
If cheats, robbers, thieves and
dacoits are everywhere,

1204
01:49:14,114 --> 01:49:15,547
how can I keep in pocket?

1205
01:49:15,749 --> 01:49:18,980
Meet sir and prove
it's your money and take it.

1206
01:49:19,886 --> 01:49:24,482
- This isn't good, I've to go home and
then go to fishing again. - Shut up!

1207
01:49:24,691 --> 01:49:28,149
Sir, he's the accused,
he's carrying good money.

1208
01:49:28,495 --> 01:49:30,087
But refusing to give valid reason.

1209
01:49:30,297 --> 01:49:33,824
You've been saying sir
but I don't see anyone.

1210
01:49:34,034 --> 01:49:35,160
Who are you talking to?

1211
01:49:35,368 --> 01:49:38,166
Why are you beating me now?

1212
01:49:38,638 --> 01:49:41,505
Why are you looking up?
Look down!

1213
01:49:47,213 --> 01:49:49,408
Why are you showing me
a 6 year old as sir?

1214
01:49:49,849 --> 01:49:50,838
A police man of this height?

1215
01:49:51,051 --> 01:49:53,349
I've never seen such
a police man in my life.

1216
01:49:53,553 --> 01:49:56,181
- Constable, up on the jeep.
- Sir is angry.

1217
01:49:56,923 --> 01:49:58,515
- Come here.
- What?

1218
01:49:58,792 --> 01:50:00,692
- What's your doubt?
- I suspect you.

1219
01:50:00,894 --> 01:50:03,624
We suspected and arrested you,
how dare you suspect us.

1220
01:50:03,897 --> 01:50:07,196
Stupid! Idiot!
How much did you seize from him?

1221
01:50:07,400 --> 01:50:07,866
Rs.2000 sir.

1222
01:50:08,068 --> 01:50:10,696
Are you suspecting police
for paltry Rs.2000?

1223
01:50:10,904 --> 01:50:11,700
Country fruit!

1224
01:50:12,405 --> 01:50:15,863
Come to station and prove
it's your money and take it.

1225
01:50:16,076 --> 01:50:17,043
It's my money.

1226
01:50:17,477 --> 01:50:18,535
Don't talk, I'll smack your face.

1227
01:50:18,745 --> 01:50:21,213
- Carry and put me on the seat.
- He's telling you, do it man.

1228
01:50:21,414 --> 01:50:22,039
He's telling you.

1229
01:50:22,248 --> 01:50:24,045
Let it be anyone, carry me.
Go quickly.

1230
01:50:24,250 --> 01:50:27,708
You took my money and asking me
to carry you, this is too much.

1231
01:50:27,921 --> 01:50:28,888
Put me in the jeep.

1232
01:50:29,089 --> 01:50:31,717
- An officer mustn't behave like this.
- Don't disturb me.

1233
01:50:31,925 --> 01:50:34,052
- Move man.
- Start the jeep. Take your hands off.

1234
01:50:37,163 --> 01:50:41,224
Sinners! They came swiftly
and took my money.

1235
01:50:41,434 --> 01:50:43,732
Did I get cheated...

1236
01:50:44,871 --> 01:50:47,499
The same green jeep is coming back.

1237
01:50:48,708 --> 01:50:49,504
Get down!

1238
01:50:52,612 --> 01:50:56,173
People will not believe even
if dons police role in a drama.

1239
01:50:56,383 --> 01:50:58,578
- He's a cheat.
- Cheat?

1240
01:50:58,785 --> 01:51:00,343
Have you given him money?

1241
01:51:00,854 --> 01:51:06,417
I did suspect sir, he was very short
and the jeep was green.

1242
01:51:06,626 --> 01:51:09,254
They are cheating because
of people like you.

1243
01:51:09,462 --> 01:51:13,762
That's why people and media
criticize police for inaction.

1244
01:51:13,967 --> 01:51:15,764
Tell me the truth,
how much did you pay him?

1245
01:51:15,969 --> 01:51:18,494
Are you asking that?
They took Rs.2000 from me.

1246
01:51:18,705 --> 01:51:20,104
Swear on your mother.

1247
01:51:20,740 --> 01:51:25,109
Swear on mother!
He's asking strangely.

1248
01:51:25,478 --> 01:51:27,275
I swear on my mother
I gave him Rs.2000.

1249
01:51:27,480 --> 01:51:30,449
He says Rs.2000 but
you said just Rs.130 only.

1250
01:51:30,650 --> 01:51:33,551
- He gave Rs.130 only sir.
- I'll kill you, idiot!

1251
01:51:33,853 --> 01:51:35,787
Speak only truth with
your senior officer.

1252
01:51:35,989 --> 01:51:38,287
Original police is coming, escape!

1253
01:51:38,491 --> 01:51:40,959
Original police?
Is he also fake?

1254
01:51:42,128 --> 01:51:44,756
Dharman isn't going
to fish without boat.

1255
01:51:44,998 --> 01:51:50,664
First houses and then buy boats
to those who don't have one.

1256
01:51:53,540 --> 01:51:57,442
Sura! Poornima hasn't come
home from college.

1257
01:51:57,644 --> 01:52:01,102
Her mobile too is switched off.
I'm scared.

1258
01:52:05,251 --> 01:52:09,881
Is her father crying about
missing daughter?

1259
01:52:10,390 --> 01:52:12,517
She's safe with me.

1260
01:52:13,259 --> 01:52:17,355
I must get back my money
in 10 minutes.

1261
01:52:17,897 --> 01:52:20,525
If not she'll face the wrath.

1262
01:52:21,901 --> 01:52:24,131
15 of my men are here,

1263
01:52:25,004 --> 01:52:28,804
they'll not let her go
even if she dies.

1264
01:52:30,210 --> 01:52:32,974
Tell me the place,
I'll come with money.

1265
01:53:30,069 --> 01:53:32,697
Got a call about bomb here,
it may go off at anytime.

1266
01:53:32,906 --> 01:53:35,466
It's a lie. Hoax call.

1267
01:53:35,675 --> 01:53:37,939
No sir, the man who called
was very confident.

1268
01:53:41,414 --> 01:53:42,881
All of you please go out.

1269
01:53:43,082 --> 01:53:47,212
- Please go out... I say go out.
- Go... you too go sir.

1270
01:53:59,032 --> 01:54:02,058
- Sir, it's in this room.
- Please go out sir.

1271
01:54:19,886 --> 01:54:21,148
What are you looking at?

1272
01:54:24,324 --> 01:54:30,923
With just a rupee I made a call
and saved my Rs.1 billion. Bye!

1273
01:54:41,140 --> 01:54:44,940
Sorry sir. We searched the place.
There's no bomb.

1274
01:54:45,278 --> 01:54:49,180
I told you it was a hoax call.
You never let me talk.

1275
01:54:49,382 --> 01:54:53,284
You sent away my guests,
my security.

1276
01:54:53,486 --> 01:54:56,011
What if people who left in
hurry took away anything?

1277
01:54:56,222 --> 01:54:57,348
Party fund was kept inside.

1278
01:54:57,557 --> 01:55:00,117
- Check the suitcase of that man.
- Hey you stop!

1279
01:55:02,829 --> 01:55:04,456
What's in the suitcase?

1280
01:55:08,568 --> 01:55:10,468
I'm asking you,
what's in the suitcase?

1281
01:55:12,171 --> 01:55:12,637
Nothing sir.

1282
01:55:12,839 --> 01:55:15,307
Why are you talking to him?
Open it and check.

1283
01:55:15,508 --> 01:55:20,207
The man looks suspicious,
let's use bomb squad to check it.

1284
01:55:35,461 --> 01:55:36,928
What's in the suitcase?

1285
01:55:38,031 --> 01:55:39,157
Bomb?

1286
01:55:39,799 --> 01:55:40,766
Money?

1287
01:55:40,967 --> 01:55:42,161
Hair!

1288
01:55:51,878 --> 01:55:53,505
- What's this?
- Fake hair!

1289
01:55:53,713 --> 01:55:57,945
Fake hair! You don't appear like
a fake hair seller.

1290
01:55:58,151 --> 01:55:59,846
It's all foreign hair.

1291
01:56:00,053 --> 01:56:03,022
It's imported, people buy only
when dressed like this.

1292
01:56:03,489 --> 01:56:08,119
It comes in ship on sea and
goes to Bombay to get polished,

1293
01:56:08,328 --> 01:56:09,260
and comes back to Chennai.

1294
01:56:09,862 --> 01:56:13,195
Very expensive.
Only rich like them can buy it.

1295
01:56:13,399 --> 01:56:16,197
That's why we came here.
But you scared us with a bomb.

1296
01:56:16,402 --> 01:56:18,700
- That girl?
- My assistant.

1297
01:56:18,972 --> 01:56:21,440
I'm selling ladies item,
so a lady assistant.

1298
01:56:21,641 --> 01:56:25,475
Uncle... sorry sir, if I come to your
home and if your wife tries it,

1299
01:56:25,678 --> 01:56:27,543
can I dare touch your wife's head?

1300
01:56:27,747 --> 01:56:29,647
Will you allow it?
That's why I've an assistant.

1301
01:56:29,849 --> 01:56:31,874
- Isn't she beautiful?
- Okay, take it and leave.

1302
01:56:32,085 --> 01:56:32,949
Bye sir.

1303
01:56:34,253 --> 01:56:37,711
Sorry sir, somebody made
a hoax call to trouble us.

1304
01:56:37,924 --> 01:56:39,721
Go away sir.

1305
01:56:42,762 --> 01:56:45,458
I've heard about thief getting
stung by scorpion,

1306
01:56:45,765 --> 01:56:47,392
I've seen it now.

1307
01:56:47,934 --> 01:56:48,400
Brother.

1308
01:56:48,601 --> 01:56:50,466
Wait... wait... why are you so furious?

1309
01:56:50,937 --> 01:56:57,638
Forget about taking money form me,
can't even take a strand of the fake hair too.

1310
01:56:58,378 --> 01:57:01,404
I'll build homes and
conduct house warming ceremony.

1311
01:57:01,614 --> 01:57:05,744
You'll come along with your gang
and enjoy our hospitality.

1312
01:57:05,952 --> 01:57:07,920
He's saying have good lick!

1313
01:57:08,688 --> 01:57:09,746
I like you.

1314
01:57:22,235 --> 01:57:23,600
I don't know what had
just happened,

1315
01:57:23,970 --> 01:57:27,838
why did they kidnap me?
But one thing is clear,

1316
01:57:28,708 --> 01:57:32,269
- my kidnappers are fools.
- Why?

1317
01:57:32,478 --> 01:57:35,777
If they had asked ransom
from my father, he would've paid.

1318
01:57:36,416 --> 01:57:39,783
You're already struggling
to make both ends meet.

1319
01:57:40,053 --> 01:57:41,281
How can they ask ransom from you?

1320
01:57:41,921 --> 01:57:44,515
You can give only fake hair, right?

1321
01:57:46,793 --> 01:57:49,125
Where were you all these days?

1322
01:57:49,996 --> 01:57:54,296
Your car, your costume
is rich and different.

1323
01:57:55,134 --> 01:57:56,123
How did you get all this?

1324
01:57:56,569 --> 01:57:58,161
I'll tell you later.

1325
01:57:58,371 --> 01:57:59,235
Okay... okay.

1326
01:57:59,772 --> 01:58:04,937
But one thing, I was scared of worse
ever since I got kidnapped.

1327
01:58:05,378 --> 01:58:12,045
You came like a storm and got me
released without a scratch.

1328
01:58:13,753 --> 01:58:17,814
Girls generally wish
for a hero like husband.

1329
01:58:18,291 --> 01:58:21,886
My man is a real hero.

1330
01:59:10,510 --> 01:59:14,412
Girl from Thanjavur come
for a program...

1331
01:59:14,614 --> 01:59:18,448
Garden of love,
give yourself to me...

1332
01:59:18,651 --> 01:59:22,417
Mischievous beau, don't tempt me...

1333
01:59:22,622 --> 01:59:25,955
Don't touch and electrify me...

1334
01:59:26,159 --> 01:59:33,964
O doll! Kiss me!

1335
01:59:34,167 --> 01:59:42,336
I'm a doll which will dance
if you key me...

1336
01:59:42,542 --> 01:59:46,444
Abracadabra! I want to finish you...

1337
01:59:46,646 --> 01:59:50,514
Tie the knot with me...
My life will turn jolly...

1338
01:59:50,716 --> 01:59:54,482
Abracadabra! I want to finish you...

1339
01:59:54,687 --> 01:59:58,919
Tie the knot with me...
My life will turn jolly...

1340
02:00:39,031 --> 02:00:42,865
The cat is after the milk...

1341
02:00:43,169 --> 02:00:47,071
You'll not scold me if my
moustache hurts your body...

1342
02:00:47,273 --> 02:00:51,039
My bangles are crying,
it's enough...

1343
02:00:51,244 --> 02:00:55,374
Your lifespan is not enough
for my desires...

1344
02:00:55,581 --> 02:00:59,381
You struck me like a storm...

1345
02:00:59,585 --> 02:01:03,612
I gave you a bouquet of love...

1346
02:01:03,823 --> 02:01:11,821
O doll! Kiss me!

1347
02:01:12,031 --> 02:01:20,200
I'm a doll which will dance
if you key me...

1348
02:01:20,406 --> 02:01:24,399
Abracadabra! I want to finish you...

1349
02:01:24,610 --> 02:01:28,376
Tie the knot with me...
My life will turn jolly...

1350
02:01:28,581 --> 02:01:32,483
Abracadabra! I want to finish you...

1351
02:01:32,685 --> 02:01:36,815
Tie the knot with me...
My life will turn jolly...

1352
02:02:25,104 --> 02:02:28,870
You're young Commander
in love battle...

1353
02:02:29,075 --> 02:02:32,977
I came to rule over you...
I gave myself to you...

1354
02:02:33,179 --> 02:02:36,945
You're the King of my heart...

1355
02:02:37,149 --> 02:02:41,279
I'll do what I say and
win over with love...

1356
02:02:41,487 --> 02:02:45,389
You're making my nights
go sleepless...

1357
02:02:45,591 --> 02:02:49,687
There's no one to win over you...

1358
02:02:49,895 --> 02:02:57,768
O doll! Kiss me!

1359
02:02:57,970 --> 02:03:06,241
I'm a doll which will dance
if you key me...

1360
02:03:06,445 --> 02:03:10,347
Abracadabra! I want to finish you...

1361
02:03:10,549 --> 02:03:14,383
Tie the knot with me...
My life will turn jolly...

1362
02:03:14,587 --> 02:03:18,421
Abracadabra! I want to finish you...

1363
02:03:18,624 --> 02:03:22,754
Tie the knot with me...
My life will turn jolly...

1364
02:07:40,019 --> 02:07:45,423
Come whatsoever,
let's live for the community...

1365
02:07:45,624 --> 02:07:46,147
Stop!

1366
02:07:47,026 --> 02:07:49,995
Do we look so weak to you?

1367
02:07:50,195 --> 02:07:51,389
When did I say that?

1368
02:07:51,597 --> 02:07:52,427
Then what.

1369
02:07:52,898 --> 02:07:57,335
You used a ladder to steal but
I spared you because of Sura.

1370
02:07:57,536 --> 02:07:59,697
Are you going to steal with
a ladder in day time?

1371
02:08:00,539 --> 02:08:02,097
Sir, please don't think and
decide yourself.

1372
02:08:02,307 --> 02:08:03,706
If we keep a ladder,
are we thieves?

1373
02:08:03,909 --> 02:08:05,672
I'm going to dry fish.

1374
02:08:08,981 --> 02:08:09,447
Beat him!

1375
02:08:09,648 --> 02:08:11,946
- How many did you arrest?
- Two.

1376
02:08:12,151 --> 02:08:13,277
One of them is running away.

1377
02:08:15,120 --> 02:08:16,087
Hey look here.

1378
02:08:16,288 --> 02:08:20,520
He's an encounter case, take care of him
till we bring back the escape.

1379
02:08:20,759 --> 02:08:22,954
If you let him escape,
we'll encounter you.

1380
02:08:23,228 --> 02:08:26,356
Sir... sir... why are you leaving
him with me?

1381
02:08:28,967 --> 02:08:30,491
Oh God!

1382
02:08:30,836 --> 02:08:32,360
He's coming closer to me.

1383
02:08:35,107 --> 02:08:37,871
Why is he looking close at me?

1384
02:08:39,244 --> 02:08:42,213
Don't know what idea he's
getting on seeing me?

1385
02:08:42,514 --> 02:08:44,709
- Will you take care of me?
- I never said that.

1386
02:08:44,917 --> 02:08:46,851
They decided for me,
how am I responsible?

1387
02:08:47,052 --> 02:08:48,451
Why did you stare at me then?

1388
02:08:48,654 --> 02:08:52,920
It's the way I look when I'm scared,
you don't get scared of it.

1389
02:08:53,125 --> 02:08:54,717
Am I scared?

1390
02:08:56,729 --> 02:08:58,492
I've killed three people.

1391
02:09:08,907 --> 02:09:13,139
You know we've one thing
common between us?

1392
02:09:13,345 --> 02:09:14,312
What?

1393
02:09:14,513 --> 02:09:18,108
Your side locks and
mine are similar, right?

1394
02:09:19,685 --> 02:09:23,314
He's not getting diverted
for anything.

1395
02:09:23,522 --> 02:09:26,616
Follow me with that ladder.

1396
02:09:27,426 --> 02:09:28,916
Follow you?

1397
02:09:31,563 --> 02:09:32,621
What?

1398
02:09:33,031 --> 02:09:34,589
Throw away that ladder.

1399
02:09:35,234 --> 02:09:36,531
Throw away that ladder.

1400
02:09:36,735 --> 02:09:40,364
I would've thrown it there,
why are you telling after coming this far?

1401
02:09:41,673 --> 02:09:42,571
I've thrown it.

1402
02:09:42,908 --> 02:09:43,875
Order a tea for me.

1403
02:09:45,144 --> 02:09:46,441
Before that get me a glass of water.

1404
02:09:46,645 --> 02:09:50,046
One tea and a glass of water.

1405
02:09:50,415 --> 02:09:51,040
Take it.

1406
02:09:51,416 --> 02:09:53,577
Take water.

1407
02:09:54,386 --> 02:09:55,614
You eat food, right?

1408
02:09:56,522 --> 02:09:57,216
Of course!

1409
02:09:57,422 --> 02:09:59,287
My hands are cuffed,
why are you giving it to me?

1410
02:09:59,925 --> 02:10:00,653
Pour in my mouth.

1411
02:10:08,867 --> 02:10:09,891
That's it!

1412
02:10:11,503 --> 02:10:12,299
Have it.

1413
02:10:16,074 --> 02:10:19,066
Has it burned?
Okay... okay...

1414
02:10:19,278 --> 02:10:20,745
Cool down... cool down...

1415
02:10:20,946 --> 02:10:23,005
I'll do it patiently, don't get angry.

1416
02:10:24,783 --> 02:10:25,977
Getting down beautifully.

1417
02:10:26,351 --> 02:10:27,010
Enough.

1418
02:10:27,653 --> 02:10:28,176
Get me a cigarette.

1419
02:10:28,387 --> 02:10:31,220
Give me a cigarette.

1420
02:10:34,359 --> 02:10:35,917
What a great style!

1421
02:10:36,328 --> 02:10:37,795
- Light it!
- Light it?

1422
02:10:38,030 --> 02:10:38,894
Rope is here.

1423
02:10:40,966 --> 02:10:41,694
It's lighted.

1424
02:10:41,900 --> 02:10:44,368
How many odd jobs I've to
do to escape from him.

1425
02:10:44,570 --> 02:10:46,765
Take it out after each puff.
After each puff?

1426
02:10:47,673 --> 02:10:49,766
Won't you let out smoke from nose?

1427
02:10:50,175 --> 02:10:51,904
- Am I showing any trick?
- I'm caught!

1428
02:10:52,110 --> 02:10:52,667
Another puff.

1429
02:10:54,379 --> 02:10:56,904
Enough, it may burn
your moustache.

1430
02:10:58,817 --> 02:10:59,943
Put it down and
crush it under your feet.

1431
02:11:00,152 --> 02:11:01,278
Should I've to do it?

1432
02:11:01,486 --> 02:11:03,181
Your leg is free, can't you do it?

1433
02:11:03,388 --> 02:11:04,355
What else you want?

1434
02:11:05,524 --> 02:11:08,049
- I want to piss.
- For that?

1435
02:11:08,260 --> 02:11:09,420
Open the door.

1436
02:11:09,628 --> 02:11:12,791
Go lost! Try someone else for that.

1437
02:11:13,699 --> 02:11:15,064
Should I open it?

1438
02:11:15,534 --> 02:11:16,558
Will you open it or not?

1439
02:11:16,768 --> 02:11:18,599
Are you great if you kill 3 people?

1440
02:11:18,804 --> 02:11:20,965
I too planned to kill many people.

1441
02:11:21,173 --> 02:11:23,937
I couldn't that's why I'm here,
appearances are deceptive.

1442
02:11:24,142 --> 02:11:27,873
Open it? You troubled me a lot
and now this...

1443
02:11:30,315 --> 02:11:31,213
Where is he?

1444
02:11:31,750 --> 02:11:33,240
Where's the accused left with me?

1445
02:11:34,152 --> 02:11:36,120
We left him with you,
are you asking us about him?

1446
02:11:36,321 --> 02:11:39,119
He's careless about police,
how will care about a civilian like me?

1447
02:11:39,391 --> 02:11:40,119
Am I DSP?

1448
02:11:40,325 --> 02:11:42,088
- Where is he?
- He has escaped!

1449
02:11:42,294 --> 02:11:42,988
Escaped?

1450
02:11:43,195 --> 02:11:45,390
Where's the man you went after?

1451
02:11:45,597 --> 02:11:47,565
- He too escaped!
- Then I'll also escape!

1452
02:11:49,401 --> 02:12:03,077
Move... go... don't push...
move back... why are you pushing?

1453
02:12:03,282 --> 02:12:04,306
Don't know what's the problem?

1454
02:12:04,516 --> 02:12:06,313
Inspector has come to see you.

1455
02:12:16,194 --> 02:12:20,221
I've requested for transfer from
Coimbatore to meet you again.

1456
02:12:20,832 --> 02:12:22,823
- Get into the jeep.
- Why?

1457
02:12:24,202 --> 02:12:26,500
I've caught you red handed
while trying to sell drugs.

1458
02:12:26,705 --> 02:12:27,729
They have started it.

1459
02:12:27,940 --> 02:12:28,406
Give it to me.

1460
02:12:28,607 --> 02:12:29,904
They always use the same ploy.

1461
02:12:30,108 --> 02:12:33,373
This is the drug
I've confiscated from you.

1462
02:12:33,578 --> 02:12:37,810
Touching Sura and touching live
high tension wire is same.

1463
02:12:38,083 --> 02:12:39,812
If you've courage,
dare touch him.

1464
02:12:41,787 --> 02:12:45,518
Brother, just say yes,
we'll crush them.

1465
02:12:46,091 --> 02:12:49,527
Trying to create trouble with kids.

1466
02:12:49,728 --> 02:12:56,224
Hello, my boys are kids
but not paper tigers.

1467
02:12:56,435 --> 02:12:58,960
They are lion and panther cubs.

1468
02:12:59,171 --> 02:13:03,232
If I let loose them on you,
you'll be gone for good.

1469
02:13:03,575 --> 02:13:09,275
I've to take you form here,
if anyone stops me, I'll open fire.

1470
02:13:09,982 --> 02:13:14,442
You'll be responsible
for every death.

1471
02:13:15,354 --> 02:13:17,845
I'm here with shooting orders.

1472
02:13:19,658 --> 02:13:24,994
We'll sleep on the road as protest,
if you've guts take our Sura crushing us.

1473
02:13:25,163 --> 02:13:25,857
Come on boys!

1474
02:13:26,064 --> 02:13:27,531
Come... move...

1475
02:13:27,733 --> 02:13:29,030
All of you be calm.

1476
02:13:30,002 --> 02:13:32,197
We'll face such hurdles till we
finish building our homes.

1477
02:13:32,404 --> 02:13:34,929
Getting things done must be
our priority not bravados.

1478
02:13:35,140 --> 02:13:37,108
They can't take and hang me.

1479
02:13:37,309 --> 02:13:38,139
Be patient.

1480
02:13:39,711 --> 02:13:41,872
- What's this Sura?
- Nothing mother.

1481
02:13:45,717 --> 02:13:46,376
Give it.

1482
02:13:53,191 --> 02:13:55,659
Hello sir! I've arrested him.

1483
02:13:56,695 --> 02:13:57,821
I'm taking him to the station.

1484
02:13:58,030 --> 02:13:59,759
Don't take him to the station.

1485
02:14:00,499 --> 02:14:02,831
If matter gets leaked,
we'll be in trouble.

1486
02:14:03,035 --> 02:14:06,095
Take him to court directly and
send him to Puzhal jail.

1487
02:14:07,039 --> 02:14:10,702
Our boys are in jail,
they will treat him in their style.

1488
02:14:11,243 --> 02:14:13,837
When get into the their act,
he'll squeal about the money.

1489
02:14:14,046 --> 02:14:14,740
Okay sir.

1490
02:14:19,718 --> 02:14:21,686
The accused's name is Sura,

1491
02:14:22,020 --> 02:14:24,420
prisoner number 29,
father's name is Sekar,

1492
02:14:24,489 --> 02:14:27,515
resident of Yaazhnagar
is a drug dealer,

1493
02:14:27,726 --> 02:14:36,691
police have arrested him with drugs
while trying to sell drugs.

1494
02:14:37,169 --> 02:14:42,038
The confiscated drugs from him
is exhibited in the court.

1495
02:14:42,240 --> 02:14:45,232
So according to NDPTS act,
section 20,

1496
02:14:45,444 --> 02:14:50,108
I request the court to remand him
to 15 days judicial custody.

1497
02:14:50,315 --> 02:14:51,441
That's all your honour.

1498
02:14:51,783 --> 02:14:55,116
I've sent him to jail,
he can't escape from me now.

1499
02:14:55,353 --> 02:14:56,479
Is your name Sura?

1500
02:15:01,159 --> 02:15:05,391
Not answering a question
is insulting the court.

1501
02:15:08,867 --> 02:15:10,494
They have charged you with
possession of drugs,

1502
02:15:10,735 --> 02:15:13,329
if the charge is false,
you can deny it.

1503
02:15:18,243 --> 02:15:20,734
Why is he silent?
Why can't he deny the charges?

1504
02:15:21,813 --> 02:15:23,007
That's what I'm also confused.

1505
02:15:23,215 --> 02:15:33,853
Taking his silence as accepting the charges,
I'm sending him to 15 days...

1506
02:15:34,059 --> 02:15:35,083
Greetings your honour!

1507
02:15:38,230 --> 02:15:39,788
Why were you silent till now?

1508
02:15:40,265 --> 02:15:44,929
Sir, my father taught me that law is
a darkroom while I was a kid.

1509
02:15:45,137 --> 02:15:48,265
If I'm casual even law will
get punished.

1510
02:15:48,707 --> 02:15:55,545
He always tell me to be sharp
while attending courts.

1511
02:15:55,747 --> 02:15:57,237
Why were you silent till now?

1512
02:15:57,449 --> 02:16:02,284
Till now I was sharpening
my weapon... sorry my brain.

1513
02:16:02,654 --> 02:16:05,487
Public prosecutor told this court
what had not happened.

1514
02:16:05,690 --> 02:16:07,351
I'll tell now what had happened
to this court.

1515
02:16:07,859 --> 02:16:09,190
You tell what will happen in future.

1516
02:16:09,394 --> 02:16:10,656
Am I right?

1517
02:16:11,763 --> 02:16:14,960
Sir, I've already met this Inspector.

1518
02:16:15,767 --> 02:16:19,533
I may've forgotten it, I'm sure he
wouldn't have forgotten it.

1519
02:16:21,173 --> 02:16:24,472
When I was in my hamlet,
sir came in a jeep.

1520
02:16:24,809 --> 02:16:28,836
He gave this packet of drugs
and asked me to sell it.

1521
02:16:29,047 --> 02:16:30,344
Accused is lying, your honour.

1522
02:16:30,549 --> 02:16:33,882
He's up to something.
He has checkmated us.

1523
02:16:34,186 --> 02:16:38,486
Did I object when PP was
charging against me?

1524
02:16:39,191 --> 02:16:41,421
- Let me finish my arguments, sir.
- Carry on.

1525
02:16:43,094 --> 02:16:46,655
I was shaken and taken aback
when he made this request.

1526
02:16:47,299 --> 02:16:51,360
A rogue, a cheat can sell drugs.

1527
02:16:51,570 --> 02:16:55,700
I cried like hell saying how can
a police man sell drugs.

1528
02:16:55,907 --> 02:16:57,238
He said for that...

1529
02:16:57,442 --> 02:17:01,139
There are many honest officers
in my department,

1530
02:17:01,346 --> 02:17:03,610
but for me when it comes
to money,

1531
02:17:04,115 --> 02:17:08,575
I'll sell drugs or even my wife too,
he said so, sir.

1532
02:17:08,787 --> 02:17:09,685
Objection your honour.

1533
02:17:09,888 --> 02:17:12,083
Mister! Don't use abusive
language in court.

1534
02:17:12,290 --> 02:17:14,281
Sir, I just repeated what he said.

1535
02:17:14,492 --> 02:17:16,585
Okay, leave it.
I'll come straight to the point.

1536
02:17:16,995 --> 02:17:21,591
When he said that, I said this
good policy may good for you,

1537
02:17:21,800 --> 02:17:25,429
but it's not good for people
like me with one father.

1538
02:17:26,171 --> 02:17:28,105
Immediately he got angry, sir.

1539
02:17:29,507 --> 02:17:32,704
My name is Dass,
law & order is dust of my feet,

1540
02:17:32,911 --> 02:17:35,880
if you don't sell this drug for me,
I'll foist cases on you.

1541
02:17:38,450 --> 02:17:39,439
He said so, sir.

1542
02:17:48,293 --> 02:17:50,056
What exactly you're trying to tell?

1543
02:17:51,263 --> 02:17:56,064
Sir, Inspector gave me the
drugs to sell it for him.

1544
02:17:56,268 --> 02:17:57,496
Objection your honour.

1545
02:17:57,702 --> 02:18:02,833
Prosecution will not accept baseless
charges against a Police officer.

1546
02:18:03,041 --> 02:18:08,479
If you raid a house now,
you can confiscate drugs.

1547
02:18:11,016 --> 02:18:15,316
No, your honour, he's trying to divert
court's attention with false accusations.

1548
02:18:16,688 --> 02:18:20,818
There's no provision in law to raid a
police officer's house taking your word.

1549
02:18:21,026 --> 02:18:24,223
Can police foist drug case
on anyone they like?

1550
02:18:24,629 --> 02:18:26,358
Is there a provision for it
in your law?

1551
02:18:26,731 --> 02:18:30,758
Tell me sir, you're sending me
to 15 days remand in jail.

1552
02:18:30,969 --> 02:18:34,996
What will you do after 15 days
if I'm proved innocent?

1553
02:18:35,206 --> 02:18:36,264
We'll release you.

1554
02:18:36,508 --> 02:18:41,445
What your law says for remanding me in jail
for 15 days without committing any crime?

1555
02:18:41,946 --> 02:18:46,110
If I'm out of jail, I'll not get work,
I may not able to marry,

1556
02:18:46,318 --> 02:18:47,683
in fact this society will consider
me an outcast.

1557
02:18:48,119 --> 02:18:49,677
What will your law say for this?

1558
02:18:50,188 --> 02:18:57,253
Will you paste posters in town that
I'm innocent and was falsely charged.

1559
02:18:57,462 --> 02:18:58,724
Sorry.
Tell me sir.

1560
02:19:01,833 --> 02:19:04,358
I'm asking the court that says
1000 criminals can escape

1561
02:19:04,536 --> 02:19:06,800
but one innocent mustn't
be punished,

1562
02:19:07,272 --> 02:19:10,139
please give me an opportunity
to prove my innocence, sir.

1563
02:19:10,342 --> 02:19:12,776
I'm not seeking adjournments
to prolong the case.

1564
02:19:12,977 --> 02:19:15,571
I'm seeking an opportunity
to prove my innocence.

1565
02:19:27,692 --> 02:19:34,222
Okay, this court orders to raid
Inspector Dass's home.

1566
02:19:35,300 --> 02:19:36,665
He confused the court.

1567
02:19:39,170 --> 02:19:41,104
He has planted something
in Inspector's house.

1568
02:19:41,306 --> 02:19:43,740
He can't do it sir, he's in court
since he was arrested.

1569
02:19:43,942 --> 02:19:44,738
How can he do it?

1570
02:19:44,943 --> 02:19:48,640
He's a magician! He can be in court
as well as in Inspector's home.

1571
02:19:48,880 --> 02:19:55,786
You go and find Inspector's house and
clear off any drugs planted there.

1572
02:19:55,987 --> 02:19:57,614
- Go immediately.
- Come... come...

1573
02:20:13,505 --> 02:20:18,772
Brother, they've left the court just now,
I'll clear off everything from there.

1574
02:20:25,316 --> 02:20:26,112
What is this?

1575
02:20:30,688 --> 02:20:33,054
- Hey!
- Who is it?

1576
02:20:33,525 --> 02:20:34,787
Why are you driving a boat on road?

1577
02:20:34,993 --> 02:20:36,051
On the road?

1578
02:20:36,594 --> 02:20:38,892
It was in sea,
how did it reach the shore?

1579
02:20:39,097 --> 02:20:43,500
How do we appear to you?

1580
02:20:43,902 --> 02:20:47,394
If I come up I'll break your waist
and that paddle.

1581
02:20:48,039 --> 02:20:49,131
Move the boat aside.

1582
02:20:49,607 --> 02:20:51,006
Is it cycle to move aside?

1583
02:20:51,576 --> 02:20:53,237
A boat is like an elephant.

1584
02:20:53,445 --> 02:20:55,003
I need few men to move it.

1585
02:20:55,213 --> 02:20:56,703
Don't waste my time with
your useless talk.

1586
02:20:56,915 --> 02:20:57,643
Are you working?

1587
02:20:57,849 --> 02:21:00,147
He's planning for something else.

1588
02:21:00,585 --> 02:21:01,745
Reverse the vehicles.

1589
02:21:01,953 --> 02:21:03,420
Traffic jam behind us, brother.

1590
02:21:13,932 --> 02:21:15,627
You mustn't enter the home, stay here.

1591
02:21:15,834 --> 02:21:16,926
You search the place.

1592
02:21:17,335 --> 02:21:18,097
Sir, I...

1593
02:21:29,948 --> 02:21:32,473
Come in... why have you
all come together?

1594
02:21:32,917 --> 02:21:33,815
Hasn't he come?

1595
02:21:34,219 --> 02:21:36,050
- Please sit there.
- Why?

1596
02:21:36,254 --> 02:21:37,152
Please sit there.

1597
02:21:38,122 --> 02:21:39,054
Search!

1598
02:21:39,624 --> 02:21:41,182
Why have they come?

1599
02:21:41,392 --> 02:21:42,723
What's happening here?

1600
02:21:45,830 --> 02:21:47,354
Sir, he's beating me.

1601
02:21:59,344 --> 02:22:00,402
Sir, we found drugs.

1602
02:22:04,983 --> 02:22:06,143
Drugs?!

1603
02:22:06,684 --> 02:22:07,981
In my home?

1604
02:22:11,122 --> 02:22:12,783
Who would've kept it here?

1605
02:22:14,325 --> 02:22:16,816
May be it was him!

1606
02:22:17,428 --> 02:22:20,056
I've opened a new provision stores,

1607
02:22:20,565 --> 02:22:26,333
I heard sir must get his cut first
from any business in this area.

1608
02:22:26,538 --> 02:22:32,170
So, I've brought a month's ration.
Please accept it.

1609
02:22:33,177 --> 02:22:36,237
You keep everything inside and go,
I must cook.

1610
02:22:36,681 --> 02:22:40,913
You cook for him, I'll book him.

1611
02:22:42,720 --> 02:22:44,517
What a smell!

1612
02:22:50,495 --> 02:22:52,520
Trust me sir, I'm innocent.
I'm not connected with this.

1613
02:22:52,730 --> 02:22:53,526
He has planned something...

1614
02:22:54,232 --> 02:22:57,201
Whatever it is, say it in court.
Hand cuff him.

1615
02:22:57,402 --> 02:22:58,596
Sir, no hand cuffs.

1616
02:23:00,238 --> 02:23:02,035
Remove his hand cuffs
and arrest him.

1617
02:23:12,283 --> 02:23:18,882
This court releases Sura as innocent.

1618
02:23:22,860 --> 02:23:25,055
Hello uncle! Is the game getting hot?

1619
02:23:25,863 --> 02:23:27,057
Want to know what game?

1620
02:23:27,532 --> 02:23:30,831
Not any game but game of cards!

1621
02:23:31,135 --> 02:23:32,830
Your man is in and I'm out.

1622
02:23:33,271 --> 02:23:39,232
I'm not a prawn to get caught
in your net, I'm a Shark...

1623
02:23:40,011 --> 02:23:43,913
I'll swallow both the net
and the fisherman.

1624
02:23:45,283 --> 02:23:48,252
Don't expect me to show another
cheek if you slap on one.

1625
02:23:49,120 --> 02:23:52,248
I'll slap your both cheeks.

1626
02:24:01,633 --> 02:24:06,935
I haven't seen anyone like him in my 15 years
of goon and 10 years of political life.

1627
02:24:08,139 --> 02:24:12,098
He's playing with my life.

1628
02:24:13,311 --> 02:24:15,108
If I take weapon, he's a warrior,

1629
02:24:15,580 --> 02:24:17,946
if I use brain,
he's like a Machiavelli.

1630
02:24:18,149 --> 02:24:19,776
Overall he's a Satan to you.

1631
02:24:20,051 --> 02:24:21,780
- What's that?
- Brother...

1632
02:24:21,986 --> 02:24:25,615
I'll not spare him...
I don't mind losing that place too.

1633
02:24:25,990 --> 02:24:28,618
I'll not let him build homes there.

1634
02:24:29,661 --> 02:24:47,808
Marudhamalai... Lord Muruga!

1635
02:24:49,380 --> 02:24:59,187
Lord Muruga of Marudhamalai...

1636
02:24:59,390 --> 02:25:03,952
Lord who protects the clan of Devars...

1637
02:25:04,162 --> 02:25:09,099
Lord Muruga of Marudhamalai...

1638
02:25:09,300 --> 02:25:13,703
Lord who protects the clan of Devars...

1639
02:25:13,905 --> 02:25:18,205
Lord Muruga of Marudhamalai...

1640
02:25:18,576 --> 02:25:21,272
Fragrant sandalwood paste...
beautiful vermilion...

1641
02:25:23,481 --> 02:25:25,711
Fragrant sandalwood paste...
beautiful vermilion...

1642
02:25:25,917 --> 02:25:28,647
Lord as we approach you...

1643
02:25:28,853 --> 02:25:34,382
Though rich with wealth,
don't forget this poor man...

1644
02:25:52,443 --> 02:25:57,847
Snow, mountain, rain, river, sea...
everything is your mercy...

1645
02:25:59,650 --> 02:26:05,247
Snow, mountain, rain, river, sea...
everything is your mercy...

1646
02:26:05,456 --> 02:26:10,917
Snow, mountain, rain, river, sea...
everything is your mercy...

1647
02:26:12,630 --> 02:26:19,763
Come... Lord Muruga... Lord...

1648
02:26:20,138 --> 02:26:22,106
Why did you throw the pot on me?

1649
02:26:24,142 --> 02:26:27,543
Who let you inside?
Teasing me and creating trouble here.

1650
02:26:28,045 --> 02:26:29,171
I'll strip you of your dhoti.

1651
02:26:29,480 --> 02:26:31,175
When I'm talking to you,
why are you after my dhoti?

1652
02:26:31,382 --> 02:26:33,441
You'll bleed yourself to death,
listen to me.

1653
02:26:33,718 --> 02:26:34,377
Calm down!

1654
02:26:34,585 --> 02:26:37,611
Bhagavathar! You sang very well
for the first time.

1655
02:26:37,822 --> 02:26:39,119
Why are you attacking him?

1656
02:26:39,323 --> 02:26:39,948
Asking me why?

1657
02:26:40,358 --> 02:26:46,297
This rogue is making
gestures that I'll die.

1658
02:26:46,497 --> 02:26:47,464
Then he says you.

1659
02:26:47,665 --> 02:26:48,859
What's the meaning of it?

1660
02:26:49,066 --> 02:26:50,693
Are you a temple administrator?

1661
02:26:51,269 --> 02:27:01,304
He says I'll die with heart attack
if I sing breathlessly.

1662
02:27:01,612 --> 02:27:05,708
A rouge can become a singer,
a singer becoming goon isn't good.

1663
02:27:06,017 --> 02:27:06,813
I'll become a goon.

1664
02:27:07,018 --> 02:27:09,816
- Watch out now.
- Why are you picking it up?

1665
02:27:10,021 --> 02:27:12,819
- If I hit you with this.
- Are you trying to kill me?

1666
02:27:20,198 --> 02:27:22,598
- Give the phone to collector.
- Sir, Minister is on line.

1667
02:27:22,800 --> 02:27:25,325
- Do it fast.
- I'll clear it in an hour.

1668
02:27:26,304 --> 02:27:27,771
Okay sir... okay sir.

1669
02:27:28,372 --> 02:27:32,001
I'll come back after clearing
everything in this hamlet. Right sir.

1670
02:27:40,117 --> 02:27:44,281
Did you see them coming like
an army attacking enemy nation?

1671
02:27:44,555 --> 02:27:47,251
They are going to raze down
our homes.

1672
02:27:47,458 --> 02:27:49,688
Collector says to leave the place.

1673
02:27:53,664 --> 02:27:55,529
- What's all this?
- Who are you?

1674
02:27:56,234 --> 02:27:57,292
One amongst us.

1675
02:27:57,501 --> 02:28:01,028
One who stands for us.
One who will talk with you for us.

1676
02:28:02,406 --> 02:28:06,536
I'm giving you just 10 minutes,
leave the place with your men.

1677
02:28:06,744 --> 02:28:07,233
Why?

1678
02:28:08,145 --> 02:28:10,136
This place belongs to government.

1679
02:28:10,348 --> 02:28:12,213
Don't these people belong
to government?

1680
02:28:13,150 --> 02:28:15,311
Have they come from any
other country illegally?

1681
02:28:16,153 --> 02:28:17,814
We give life to refuge seekers,

1682
02:28:18,356 --> 02:28:21,655
why are you chasing we Tamils
like dogs in our homeland?

1683
02:28:22,093 --> 02:28:26,120
For that will you occupy
government land,

1684
02:28:26,797 --> 02:28:28,389
and we should keep quiet?

1685
02:28:28,599 --> 02:28:33,229
We didn't occupy this place,
we've been living here for generations.

1686
02:28:33,704 --> 02:28:36,571
My father was born here,
I was born here,

1687
02:28:36,874 --> 02:28:38,842
my son will also be born here only.

1688
02:28:40,511 --> 02:28:42,672
We are not asking you
to build our homes.

1689
02:28:43,547 --> 02:28:48,416
Just give us ownership documents.
We'll take care of the rest.

1690
02:28:49,387 --> 02:28:52,914
Are we asking any apartment
in Annanagar?

1691
02:28:53,224 --> 02:28:55,590
Seeking any bungalow
in Poes Garden?

1692
02:28:58,396 --> 02:29:00,159
Useless salty sand.

1693
02:29:01,198 --> 02:29:07,262
If you throw us out from here also,
where can we go?

1694
02:29:09,640 --> 02:29:14,441
If you can't give ownership documents
and want us to vacate this place,

1695
02:29:15,212 --> 02:29:19,945
kill us all and take this place.

1696
02:29:24,655 --> 02:29:25,713
All of you sit down.

1697
02:29:31,162 --> 02:29:33,289
- Give the phone to Collector.
- Sir Minister on line.

1698
02:29:33,497 --> 02:29:35,727
Let him be, you heard him, right?

1699
02:29:35,933 --> 02:29:40,734
He has moved my soul.
I don't know how to answer him.

1700
02:29:40,938 --> 02:29:44,533
- Sir, let police do...
- Did you see him?

1701
02:29:44,976 --> 02:29:47,809
He's sitting cool like a volcano
ready to erupt at anytime.

1702
02:29:48,012 --> 02:29:50,742
I think with a gesture he can
make the sea burn.

1703
02:29:51,449 --> 02:29:53,974
- What should I do now?
- Sir is tensed.

1704
02:29:54,318 --> 02:29:56,650
- Give it to him.
- Minister is on line.

1705
02:29:57,688 --> 02:29:59,986
Switch off the phone.
Switch it off I say.

1706
02:30:07,765 --> 02:30:10,598
Your anger and
your request is justified,

1707
02:30:10,801 --> 02:30:12,894
to give you ownership documents,

1708
02:30:13,137 --> 02:30:16,504
what's the proof you were living here?

1709
02:30:18,209 --> 02:30:22,339
We lost everything in fire.
We don't have any evidence.

1710
02:30:22,546 --> 02:30:23,945
I'm helpless then.

1711
02:30:24,949 --> 02:30:26,007
We've evidence, sir.

1712
02:30:35,159 --> 02:30:36,183
What's it Sura?

1713
02:30:36,761 --> 02:30:41,698
Father, I need to talk to you.
All are my village's ration cards.

1714
02:30:42,500 --> 02:30:46,129
People in village are
pawning cards to booze.

1715
02:30:46,504 --> 02:30:47,937
That's why I brought all cards here.

1716
02:30:48,506 --> 02:30:51,771
Give to women only to buy
food grains and kerosene.

1717
02:30:51,976 --> 02:30:53,443
And take it back.

1718
02:30:53,811 --> 02:30:56,041
This will help us greatly, Father.

1719
02:30:57,581 --> 02:31:02,314
I gave it to him for some other reason,
so we could save it.

1720
02:31:02,820 --> 02:31:04,617
Isn't this enough?

1721
02:31:04,855 --> 02:31:05,549
Enough.

1722
02:31:06,657 --> 02:31:08,887
Inform revenue department and arrange
for their land documents.

1723
02:31:09,093 --> 02:31:09,889
- Sir.
- Okay?

1724
02:31:10,094 --> 02:31:10,719
Okay sir.

1725
02:31:11,429 --> 02:31:12,726
- Thank you very much sir.
- No need.

1726
02:31:13,264 --> 02:31:14,492
You've done it, Sura!

1727
02:31:15,933 --> 02:31:19,391
- I'm proud of you son.
- We've won!

1728
02:33:05,576 --> 02:33:07,271
When I walk it's earth shattering...

1729
02:33:07,478 --> 02:33:11,778
My words are like crackers...
You're my love...

1730
02:33:12,816 --> 02:33:14,374
When you walk it's earth shattering...

1731
02:33:14,585 --> 02:33:18,954
Your words are like crackers...
I'm your love...

1732
02:33:20,057 --> 02:33:23,549
I'm a shining star...

1733
02:33:23,761 --> 02:33:27,128
I'm a fan admiring you...

1734
02:33:27,331 --> 02:33:34,294
My name is a bombshell...
Don't say bye to me...

1735
02:33:34,505 --> 02:33:41,809
Your name is a bombshell...
I'll not say bye to you...

1736
02:34:18,148 --> 02:34:21,515
You're my heart beat...
you're my love fever...

1737
02:34:21,719 --> 02:34:24,187
You're my loveline...

1738
02:34:25,389 --> 02:34:28,517
You're shining stars...
you're the dew...

1739
02:34:28,726 --> 02:34:32,184
You're a garden...

1740
02:34:32,396 --> 02:34:35,854
You're daughter of moon...

1741
02:34:36,066 --> 02:34:39,365
You're my beau...

1742
02:34:39,570 --> 02:34:43,199
You're my home...
bamboo forest...

1743
02:34:43,407 --> 02:34:46,706
I'll lit fire of passion
with my fingers...

1744
02:34:46,910 --> 02:34:50,539
Why are you rushing?
Why are you so desirous?

1745
02:34:50,748 --> 02:34:54,206
I'll fix you in love lock...

1746
02:35:30,454 --> 02:35:33,912
You're the love arrow...
You're my nerves...

1747
02:35:34,124 --> 02:35:36,592
You're the mischief of night...

1748
02:35:37,628 --> 02:35:40,927
you're a butterfly...
your eyes speak colouful language...

1749
02:35:41,131 --> 02:35:48,094
You're the love of my life...
I'm a raging bull...

1750
02:35:48,305 --> 02:35:51,763
I'm fodder to your hunger...

1751
02:35:51,975 --> 02:35:55,536
Visual will change at
an arm's length...

1752
02:35:55,746 --> 02:35:58,943
I get intoxicated on seeing a flower...

1753
02:35:59,149 --> 02:36:06,112
A rose garden is after you...
I'm just a doll in your hand...

1754
02:36:06,323 --> 02:36:07,950
When I walk it's earth shattering...

1755
02:36:08,158 --> 02:36:12,527
My words are like crackers...
You're my love...

1756
02:36:13,497 --> 02:36:15,124
When you walk it's earth shattering...

1757
02:36:15,332 --> 02:36:19,735
Your words are like crackers...
I'm your love...

1758
02:36:20,771 --> 02:36:24,298
I'm a shining star...

1759
02:36:24,508 --> 02:36:27,807
I'm a fan admiring you...

1760
02:36:28,011 --> 02:36:35,076
My name is a bombshell...
Don't say bye to me...

1761
02:36:35,285 --> 02:36:42,657
Your name is a bombshell...
I'll not say bye to you...

1762
02:36:54,405 --> 02:36:54,871
What happened?

1763
02:36:55,072 --> 02:37:00,203
If this bomb goes off, everything within
a kilometre will get razed to dust.

1764
02:37:00,677 --> 02:37:02,440
Can't identify even the body?

1765
02:37:02,913 --> 02:37:05,711
Complete program of the bomb
is fed into this computer.

1766
02:37:06,016 --> 02:37:09,543
We can switch on
or off from here only.

1767
02:37:09,853 --> 02:37:14,552
Entire hamlet will gather in one place
by tomorrow morning at 9 am.

1768
02:37:14,758 --> 02:37:17,727
They are celebrating house warming
ceremony unitedly in one home.

1769
02:37:18,762 --> 02:37:23,131
Everyone must be dead before
house warming ceremony is over.

1770
02:37:26,103 --> 02:37:29,732
Raise the festoon.
Further high!

1771
02:37:41,118 --> 02:37:42,642
Why corporation lorry is here?

1772
02:37:42,853 --> 02:37:43,911
You're conducting house
warming ceremony, aren't you?

1773
02:37:44,121 --> 02:37:46,351
Corporation has sent it
to clean the area.

1774
02:37:46,723 --> 02:37:47,189
That's why.

1775
02:37:47,391 --> 02:37:49,586
Go backside,
lot of trash, clean it.

1776
02:37:49,793 --> 02:37:52,591
Do it. Come, we too have lot to do.

1777
02:39:17,548 --> 02:39:19,015
Start the boat quickly!

1778
02:39:31,962 --> 02:39:33,020
Go fast!

1779
02:40:02,960 --> 02:40:09,126
What did you say? Will you swallow the
net and the fisherman too?

1780
02:40:10,667 --> 02:40:15,104
The land I wanted to usurp and
my Rs.1 billion worth goods,

1781
02:40:15,539 --> 02:40:18,372
I've lost it and yet left you alive.

1782
02:40:22,980 --> 02:40:27,474
I would've buried you
in water itself.

1783
02:40:28,251 --> 02:40:34,713
But you would've died happily for fulfilling
the vow of building homes for your people.

1784
02:40:35,092 --> 02:40:38,220
No, I'll not let you die peacefully.

1785
02:40:40,597 --> 02:40:41,495
Look there!

1786
02:40:44,101 --> 02:40:46,899
In few minutes,
you'll see thick cloud of smoke!

1787
02:40:47,170 --> 02:40:51,402
It's not smoke but your aim,
your wish, your dream.

1788
02:40:51,608 --> 02:40:58,411
You must cry seeing all your efforts
being razed to dust.

1789
02:40:58,615 --> 02:41:01,516
In 10 minutes bomb will go off.

1790
02:41:01,785 --> 02:41:06,085
Nobody will remain even
to mourn the dead.

1791
02:41:20,871 --> 02:41:24,034
Agreed there won't be anyone
to mourn the dead,

1792
02:41:26,143 --> 02:41:29,601
but you will be there to mourn the
death of your wife and children.

1793
02:41:29,813 --> 02:41:30,780
What are you saying?

1794
02:41:30,981 --> 02:41:36,385
Your wife is the chief guest
in the function.

1795
02:41:40,057 --> 02:41:41,854
What are you saying?

1796
02:41:42,092 --> 02:41:47,621
Not only your wife is there,
your children too are there only.

1797
02:41:50,434 --> 02:41:54,461
The bomb you've planted isn't
just for the hamlet,

1798
02:41:54,771 --> 02:41:57,467
you've planted it for
your own family too.

1799
02:41:57,841 --> 02:42:01,299
No... no way... my wife will
never go to such places.

1800
02:42:03,180 --> 02:42:07,310
- Hello...
- Hello!

1801
02:42:07,517 --> 02:42:09,314
- Where are you?
- Yaazhnagar!

1802
02:42:10,053 --> 02:42:11,816
Who told you to go there?

1803
02:42:12,456 --> 02:42:15,323
Why are you asking like that?
Elections are coming.

1804
02:42:15,692 --> 02:42:17,557
This hamlet has good many votes.

1805
02:42:19,262 --> 02:42:20,820
You were out of station for a week.

1806
02:42:21,732 --> 02:42:23,996
- Hello...
- Can you hear me?

1807
02:42:24,201 --> 02:42:25,168
Hello!

1808
02:42:27,871 --> 02:42:32,501
Hello... hello... hello!

1809
02:42:34,711 --> 02:42:36,235
Brother, bomb will blast off
in just 5 minutes.

1810
02:42:36,880 --> 02:42:39,849
Do it fast, switch it off.
Go fast!

1811
02:42:40,050 --> 02:42:42,518
I must save my wife and
children, go fast!

1812
02:42:48,592 --> 02:42:50,787
- Barge has drifted away.
- Jump on to it.

1813
02:42:50,994 --> 02:42:53,462
What are you waiting for?
Jump quickly.

1814
02:42:54,965 --> 02:42:55,863
Quick!

1815
02:43:58,762 --> 02:44:02,698
You saved your hamlet hiding
behind my wife and kids.

1816
02:44:02,899 --> 02:44:05,265
I'll destroy your hamlet
at any cost.

1817
02:44:05,468 --> 02:44:08,266
I'll kill you before that.

1818
02:44:08,471 --> 02:44:10,598
Pull the anchor! Fast!

1819
02:49:40,537 --> 02:49:43,938
Hoist the flag of victory...
It's our sweep...

1820
02:49:44,140 --> 02:49:47,598
Future is all ours...

1821
02:49:48,311 --> 02:49:55,444
Lets stay together like catamarans...
Nobody can win against us...

1822
02:49:56,052 --> 02:49:59,783
Let's stand together like
siblings of one mother...

1823
02:49:59,989 --> 02:50:03,789
Must become role models
to the future world...

1824
02:50:03,993 --> 02:50:08,623
The world which thinks
we are just match sticks...

1825
02:50:08,831 --> 02:50:13,461
Show them by friction
what you are...

1826
