1
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:52,083
The pot is hung here.
There are a couple of lunch boxes.

2
00:01:52,166 --> 00:01:54,333
I'll stop here. Let's find out.

3
00:01:54,666 --> 00:01:56,000
Yes. Stop here.

4
00:01:56,541 --> 00:01:57,750
Oh, Lord.

5
00:02:00,791 --> 00:02:03,208
Is this Mr. Shivendra's house?

6
00:02:04,083 --> 00:02:05,416
Yeah, it is.

7
00:02:11,375 --> 00:02:15,541
SHANTI KUNJ
SINCE 1936

8
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:28,125
Alok.

9
00:02:28,625 --> 00:02:30,000
You look dope, bro.

10
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:32,833
Parchun.

11
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:34,791
This is not a time for jokes.

12
00:02:37,416 --> 00:02:40,583
He must've been 27, 28.

13
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:42,708
Yes, his name was Astik.

14
00:02:42,791 --> 00:02:44,833
It has only been
five months since their wedding.

15
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:49,750
Sandhya? The poor girl's in her room.

16
00:02:49,833 --> 00:02:51,666
She hasn't come out since yesterday.

17
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:54,166
No, no, she's not inauspicious.

18
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:56,833
Their horoscopes were compatible.

19
00:02:56,916 --> 00:03:00,166
Mom! Is my toothpaste in your suitcase?

20
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:04,166
I haven't unpacked yet.
So many guests are here. Ask anyone.

21
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:06,000
It's Achint.

22
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:09,291
Yes, he's all grown up now.

23
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:10,416
Listen.

24
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,958
You know I only use Pepsodent.

25
00:03:13,708 --> 00:03:15,458
Go and wait. I'll get it for you.

26
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:16,583
I've had it.

27
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:18,250
These boys and their tantrums.

28
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:21,083
He's come for a funeral,
but wants his fancy toothpaste.

29
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:23,958
Greetings, Aunt Tulika.

30
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Sandhya...

31
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:42,416
Is she okay?

32
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:48,208
I heard she's quite depressed.

33
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:53,375
<i>Jiji,</i> Gulu <i>Didi</i>
from Bahraich is on the line.

34
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:59,250
Saroj's auntie's daughter
whose husband is a government official.

35
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:05,250
I don't know how to explain.
It happened all of a sudden.

36
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:09,875
Yes, we did the cremation yesterday.

37
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:13,208
There was no point waiting.

38
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:16,625
Maybe this is where
his journey had to end.

39
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:19,833
May Goddess Radha bless his soul.

40
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:23,500
Yes. He's fine as well.

41
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:26,750
Careful. I'm having a bath.

42
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:29,250
How much per day for these mattresses?

43
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:30,333
Thirty-five rupees.

44
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:36,000
That's plain robbery.

45
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:40,125
No, sir. Mr. Rizvi knows
that your son has passed away,

46
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:42,791
hence he has already given you
a discount of 20%.

47
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:45,541
I don't want any favors.

48
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,291
My son has died.

49
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:53,125
I'm not asking for a discount.

50
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:57,916
The usual rate is 25 rupees.
That's all I'll pay.

51
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:01,708
Sandhya...

52
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:07,125
<i>Yeah, well, we are all worried about her.</i>

53
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:25,791
"He was the sun in a sky full of stars."

54
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:31,000
"Our deepest sorrows
that he's no more ours."

55
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:34,000
"RIP."

56
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:37,125
"May God help your soul..."

57
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:40,583
"Rest in peace."

58
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:44,208
It's all copy-pasted.

59
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:47,291
<i>Please open the door.</i>

60
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:50,291
<i>Please open the door.</i>

61
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:54,125
Get the doorbell changed, man.

62
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:57,833
<i>Please open the door.</i>

63
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:02,250
Where is Sandhya?

64
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:09,166
Mother!

65
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:23,625
Papa, Sangya and Snehu didn't come?

66
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:28,250
That's enough, Mom.

67
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:31,750
Enough now. Stop crying, Mom.

68
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:38,375
I'll send some tea.

69
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:40,291
- Mom.
- Yes.

70
00:06:40,375 --> 00:06:42,875
- I don't want tea.
- Okay.

71
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:44,333
Please arrange for some Pepsi.

72
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:46,708
Parchun will get it from his shop.

73
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,708
Pepsi at a time like this?

74
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:04,791
Fine, let it be.

75
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:06,583
But I won't have tea.

76
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:15,166
Are you all right?

77
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:23,375
- Mom.
- Yes?

78
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:26,916
Mom, who took the bed out of my room?

79
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:29,041
- I don't know.
- I did.

80
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:36,000
- Why?
- Because Astik is still with us.

81
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:40,291
For 13 days,
the soul remains around the house.

82
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:44,000
The earthen pot on the tree outside
is where we give him food.

83
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:47,125
It takes ten days
for the soul to be free of its body.

84
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:51,500
On the thirteenth day, his soul
will be liberated and go to Yamlok.

85
00:07:54,666 --> 00:07:56,625
You performed
the rituals for Astik's last rites.

86
00:07:56,708 --> 00:07:58,541
You must follow these rules for 13 days.

87
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:01,750
No cigarettes, alcohol or tobacco.

88
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:06,500
One meal a day,
without turmeric, garlic and onions.

89
00:08:07,916 --> 00:08:10,916
And sleep on the floor,
away from everyone else.

90
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:18,416
Why wasn't I informed of this before?

91
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:21,458
Can't you do this much
for your own dead brother?

92
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:31,375
I forgot to mention
Dad doesn't take sugar in his tea.

93
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,208
Easy. Take it easy, man.

94
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:37,541
If I'd died, Mom would've never asked
her beloved Astik to sleep on the floor.

95
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:38,625
What?

96
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:43,416
But if you were dead,
you'd be a buried corpse.

97
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,208
How would it matter to you anyway?

98
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:51,041
Come on, move from here.

99
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:57,541
Why am I asked
to do everything for everyone?

100
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:02,750
Astik never cared for anyone but himself.

101
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:07,541
Even after his death,
he remains a problem.

102
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:12,041
Sandhya's now a widow and I'm bald.

103
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:16,250
And now, your English lessons
from Sandhya will also stop.

104
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:22,500
At least you were
learning something from her.

105
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:28,083
Let it be, I'll do it.

106
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:30,416
Sit.

107
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:50,041
For how many days
are you planning to stay?

108
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:56,541
Thirteen days.
We're staying till the wake for sure.

109
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:57,833
Staying here?

110
00:09:57,916 --> 00:09:59,666
Yes. Why?

111
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:02,500
You won't be able to.

112
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:06,958
They don't have western toilets here.

113
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:09,083
Only Indian style.

114
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:11,625
How will you bend down to use it?

115
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,583
It's been five months,
and I'm still not used to it.

116
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:39,083
<i>Something is up with Sandhya.</i>

117
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:42,916
I am sure of it. But Usha <i>Bhabhi</i>
is being secretive about it.

118
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:44,833
Janaki <i>Didi?</i>

119
00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:47,958
- Tulika?
- When did you arrive?

120
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:50,333
Greetings, <i>Bhai Sahab.</i>

121
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:52,458
We just arrived.

122
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:54,833
We got a call last night
from Shivendra <i>Bhai Sahab.</i>

123
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:56,125
I got scared.

124
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:58,666
I thought Mother passed away.

125
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:07,791
Never imagined it would be Astik instead.

126
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:12,541
"As flies to wanton boys,
are we to the gods."

127
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:14,583
"They kill us for their sport."

128
00:11:17,916 --> 00:11:18,916
Shakespeare.

129
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,500
How do you remember English poetry?

130
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:25,791
I don't even understand it.

131
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:30,000
Lunch is ready. Please come.

132
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:31,208
- Sure.
- Okay.

133
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:38,041
Her husband has left her.

134
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:41,875
She hasn't said anything,
but everyone knows.

135
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,208
He's in Dubai.

136
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:46,791
Right, Mother?

137
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:48,750
Usha.

138
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:51,000
Come on, Mom.

139
00:11:51,541 --> 00:11:53,250
Usha is your daughter-in-law.

140
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:56,500
I am your daughter, Janaki.

141
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,000
You've forgotten everything.

142
00:11:59,083 --> 00:12:00,125
Hey, listen.

143
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,083
What's the sleeping arrangement here?

144
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:12,916
<i>Please open the door.</i>

145
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:16,166
Will someone
just rip the wire off that bell!

146
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:20,000
<i>Please open the door.</i>

147
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:23,583
<i>Please open the door.</i>

148
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:25,041
Sorry, the bell...

149
00:12:26,916 --> 00:12:27,916
<i>Namaste.</i>

150
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,125
Is this Shivendra Giri's house?

151
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:32,416
I'm Nazia Zaidi.

152
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,500
Nazia!

153
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:42,625
Leave the suitcase here.
I'll send it over.

154
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:43,708
Okay.

155
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:53,000
Nazia Zaidi.

156
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:05,375
I found out through Facebook.

157
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:07,083
Your sister had posted.

158
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:10,458
Yes, the post has 235 comments.

159
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:14,708
<i>Bhabhi.</i>

160
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,916
<i>Bhabhi, </i>Shivendra Uncle has asked me
to put her luggage in your room.

161
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Shall I?

162
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:27,375
Come.

163
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:32,166
Here, I'll take it.

164
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,875
- Parchun.
- Yes?

165
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,791
Is your shop open?

166
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:40,666
Yes, <i>Bhabhi,</i> you want something?

167
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:43,583
Yes. A Pepsi for Nazia.

168
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:46,208
Okay.

169
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:48,500
And a packet of chips.

170
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:50,791
The spicy ones.

171
00:13:56,916 --> 00:13:58,458
Alok couldn't stand this food either.

172
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:00,625
I'll get them.

173
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,750
- Mom...
- Eat this without any fuss.

174
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:17,583
Some more vegetable curry?

175
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:25,125
Nobody is eating properly.

176
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:33,250
Giri <i>ji,</i> please check with Sandhya...

177
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:35,875
if she wants to live with you for a while.

178
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:36,958
No.

179
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:39,666
What will she do there?

180
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:42,500
This is her home now.

181
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:48,166
We'll ask her later.

182
00:14:49,416 --> 00:14:51,041
Right now, she's too distressed.

183
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:52,958
PTSD.

184
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:59,916
Post-traumatic stress disorder.

185
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:02,750
It's psychological.

186
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:04,750
Mental trauma.

187
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:09,625
Quite a common occurrence
in such circumstances.

188
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:11,500
Mr. Ghanshyam is a banker.

189
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:14,916
But he has knowledge
about everything else as well.

190
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:18,000
<i>What's going on with you, Sandhya?</i>

191
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:22,208
Why are you behaving
like nothing has happened?

192
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:35,833
Nazia.

193
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:41,125
You know, when I was a kid,
we had a cat, Katrina.

194
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:44,250
She got run over by a car.

195
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:47,583
I cried a lot.

196
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:51,083
And didn't eat anything for three days.

197
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:57,750
I don't feel like that at all.

198
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:02,583
I don't feel like crying,

199
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:04,791
and I feel hungry all the time.

200
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:08,375
Honestly, I feel like running away.

201
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:09,458
But I can't.

202
00:16:23,791 --> 00:16:26,083
<i>Tayaji,</i> anything else?

203
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:27,875
Yes, I'm going to slap you.

204
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:30,583
Pay your respects to your brother.

205
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:37,916
That's better. Let's go.

206
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:43,125
Ammi, <i>Sandhya wants me
to stay here till the wake.</i>

207
00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:45,541
Don't worry, I'll do my laundry.

208
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,125
Or I'll wear Sandhya's.

209
00:16:54,541 --> 00:16:56,458
Yes, they'll fit. She's my size.

210
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:00,291
<i>Ammi,</i> I'll call you back.

211
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:03,125
Get up and sit on the chair.
Hurry, sit on the chair.

212
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:06,250
Nazia, go look for some scraps of paper.

213
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:08,125
- What are you up to, Mummy?
- I'm saying...

214
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:12,041
Just listen to me. Get up. Come on.

215
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:17,458
Sit on the chair. Sit, please.

216
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:20,541
Yes.

217
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:25,125
Go see if you can find a stone
or something I can put the wok on.

218
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:26,291
Stone?

219
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:30,666
What are you waiting for?
Start searching. You'll find something.

220
00:17:32,791 --> 00:17:34,083
Auntie, a stone.

221
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:37,541
Now put the wok on the stone.
Hurry. Tear up the newspaper as well.

222
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:39,083
Get moving.

223
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:40,916
Nazia, why are you playing along?

224
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,125
Let her.

225
00:17:42,791 --> 00:17:44,291
You keep at it.

226
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:48,375
I knew it
the minute I saw you this morning.

227
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:50,666
You've been jinxed by an evil eye.

228
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:53,000
But I'll fix it.

229
00:17:57,958 --> 00:17:59,000
This is your house, too.

230
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:01,208
They can't just kick you out.

231
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:03,625
What are you blabbering on about?
Who is kicking me out?

232
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:05,458
You don't know what's going on.

233
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:07,750
Please don't protest, for my sake.

234
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:11,875
Lift your feet.

235
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:16,250
I beg you, lift your feet.

236
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:24,875
You and your superstitions, Mummy.

237
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:26,708
I've been seeing them since childhood.

238
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:29,583
When I fell off my bicycle
in the sixth grade,

239
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:32,083
remember, you told me
that the evil eye had jinxed me.

240
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:34,625
You kept checking
if any of my bones were broken,

241
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:36,500
saying, "Who would marry a cripple?"

242
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:38,500
You were so concerned
about getting me married,

243
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:40,291
you returned my brand-new bicycle.

244
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Amazing.

245
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:45,250
Instead of getting me a tutor,

246
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:47,875
you made me wear
a sapphire ring on my right pinkie.

247
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:50,375
So I would get better grades in school.

248
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:53,333
Weren't you top of your class
when you did your English MA?

249
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:54,625
I was. But did it matter?

250
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:57,833
Of course it did. You got a nice groom.
He earned Rs. 70,000 per month.

251
00:18:57,916 --> 00:18:59,041
And now?

252
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:12,666
What are you doing?

253
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,541
Only your tears
can get rid of the evil eye.

254
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:16,708
I don't know that,
but this will kill me for sure.

255
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:19,500
- So much smoke. The evil spirit is strong.
- Let it go, Mummy.

256
00:19:20,916 --> 00:19:22,125
Who has come at this time?

257
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:25,375
Go, keep it outside. Hurry.

258
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:28,375
What are you doing?

259
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:32,791
Sandhya darling?

260
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:38,708
Who is it?

261
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:39,791
It's me.

262
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:41,875
Alka <i>ji,</i> it's me.

263
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:53,750
Please stay strong, Alka<i> ji.</i>

264
00:19:58,166 --> 00:19:59,208
So much smoke?

265
00:19:59,291 --> 00:20:02,083
Mom, it's coming from the lane outside.
It's unbearable.

266
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:04,166
<i>Bhabhi,</i> it's the boys in the lane.

267
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:06,583
They burn old tires for their bonfire.

268
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:07,916
I'll handle them.

269
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:16,541
Ghanshyam Uncle will be going to...

270
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:18,625
Astik's...

271
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,416
He'll be going
to get his death certificate and...

272
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:36,333
He also has some bank work,

273
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:41,958
so he will need
Astik's bank documents and ID.

274
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:44,916
Can you please
check for them in his cupboard?

275
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,000
Come inside.

276
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:55,958
<i>Bhabhi.</i>

277
00:20:57,583 --> 00:21:01,041
I was wondering if I should
take Nazia out for dinner.

278
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:05,250
Pappu <i>Tayaji</i> said
we are still in mourning...

279
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:07,541
<i>and need to maintain purity.</i>

280
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:25,833
What is going on?

281
00:21:29,333 --> 00:21:30,875
You're disrespecting the rituals.

282
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:34,541
Aren't you as well?

283
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:40,250
Don't argue.
Go to your room and go to sleep.

284
00:21:48,583 --> 00:21:51,416
Today I'll make you try
the best mutton biryani in the world.

285
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,791
You've never tasted anything like it.

286
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:55,916
I haven't. I'm a vegetarian.

287
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,458
Nazia<i> ji, </i>you?

288
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,375
You don't eat non-veg?

289
00:22:00,458 --> 00:22:01,458
No.

290
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:04,416
Well, not every Tendulkar is Sachin.

291
00:22:06,833 --> 00:22:07,875
Well, not a problem.

292
00:22:08,666 --> 00:22:11,166
We have equally famous
and tasty vegetarian food as well.

293
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:36,041
FOR MY SWEETHEART...

294
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:42,458
<i>Why does this moment</i>

295
00:23:42,541 --> 00:23:47,791
<i>Hurt so much?</i>

296
00:23:47,875 --> 00:23:53,291
<i>Why am I so</i>

297
00:23:53,375 --> 00:23:58,625
<i>Angry at myself?</i>

298
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:04,708
<i>How do I</i>

299
00:24:04,791 --> 00:24:09,750
<i>Ask him?</i>

300
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:15,375
<i>Why did he turn out to be a cheater?</i>

301
00:24:15,458 --> 00:24:21,000
<i>Angry at myself</i>

302
00:24:21,083 --> 00:24:25,500
<i>I do have desires</i>

303
00:24:27,083 --> 00:24:30,666
<i>But I'm afraid of life</i>

304
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:36,958
<i>I rise and fall</i>

305
00:24:37,041 --> 00:24:42,416
<i>Life is mad at me</i>

306
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:47,375
<i>Like shooting stars</i>

307
00:24:48,083 --> 00:24:53,458
<i>My heart, you fly away</i>

308
00:24:53,541 --> 00:24:58,708
<i>And show me a way</i>

309
00:25:02,541 --> 00:25:03,541
<i>Listen...</i>

310
00:25:05,208 --> 00:25:07,500
if Sandhya wants
to come back home with us, then...

311
00:25:08,791 --> 00:25:10,041
talk to her.

312
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:18,250
We have
two unmarried daughters at home already.

313
00:25:18,958 --> 00:25:21,083
You can't even manage small things,

314
00:25:22,208 --> 00:25:23,875
yet you talk so big.

315
00:25:27,583 --> 00:25:33,000
<i>My eyes</i>

316
00:25:33,083 --> 00:25:38,541
<i>Are silent</i>

317
00:25:38,625 --> 00:25:43,000
<i>I don't know</i>

318
00:25:43,916 --> 00:25:48,208
<i>What they want</i>

319
00:25:49,708 --> 00:25:55,083
<i>The dreams</i>

320
00:25:55,166 --> 00:26:00,541
<i>That were in these eyes</i>

321
00:26:00,625 --> 00:26:05,916
<i>Why did they fade away?</i>

322
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,291
<i>How do I know?</i>

323
00:26:12,333 --> 00:26:14,375
<i>We had a lot of faith in God.</i>

324
00:26:18,166 --> 00:26:19,708
I named my son Astik.

325
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:29,916
<i>I do have desires</i>

326
00:26:31,125 --> 00:26:35,333
<i>But I'm afraid of life</i>

327
00:26:36,666 --> 00:26:41,208
<i>I rise and fall</i>

328
00:26:41,291 --> 00:26:46,333
<i>Life is mad at me</i>

329
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:52,208
<i>Like shooting stars</i>

330
00:26:52,291 --> 00:26:57,541
<i>My heart, you fly away</i>

331
00:26:57,625 --> 00:27:02,916
<i>And show me a way</i>

332
00:27:13,041 --> 00:27:14,833
<i>Didi,</i> have your tea.

333
00:27:16,166 --> 00:27:18,833
Let it be. I'll do it.
Go and have you tea.

334
00:27:18,916 --> 00:27:20,083
Thank you, Jhumri.

335
00:27:21,791 --> 00:27:22,916
Good morning.

336
00:27:23,791 --> 00:27:25,000
Slept well?

337
00:27:38,916 --> 00:27:41,666
The one in the red cup is for you.

338
00:27:42,166 --> 00:27:44,125
Why? Is it special?

339
00:27:44,833 --> 00:27:46,291
Well, yes, it is.

340
00:27:46,375 --> 00:27:48,875
Usha Auntie made it especially for you.

341
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:49,958
Thanks.

342
00:27:58,666 --> 00:27:59,875
Is it too sweet?

343
00:28:00,541 --> 00:28:01,750
No, it's fine.

344
00:28:01,833 --> 00:28:03,250
Don't worry, I'll get it replaced.

345
00:28:04,166 --> 00:28:06,208
Jhumri, you go and make some tea for her.

346
00:28:06,291 --> 00:28:08,541
<i>Didi, </i>I have lots of work.

347
00:28:08,625 --> 00:28:10,583
I need to give Grandma her tea.

348
00:28:10,666 --> 00:28:13,041
Leave Grandma's cup here.
I'll give it to her.

349
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:18,083
And see those files on the table?
Give them to Mom.

350
00:28:27,291 --> 00:28:28,625
- Nazia?
- Yes.

351
00:28:32,791 --> 00:28:34,500
I'll go give Grandma her tea.

352
00:28:34,583 --> 00:28:36,375
Usha <i>Chachi,</i> here.

353
00:28:38,416 --> 00:28:40,166
The documents you'd asked for.

354
00:28:41,166 --> 00:28:44,333
Husband, you're very forgetful.

355
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:47,416
The riverbank will be cold.
Take this shawl with you.

356
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:50,500
No. The weather will be pleasant today.
I checked it on Google already.

357
00:28:50,583 --> 00:28:52,041
- Giri <i>ji?</i>
- Yes.

358
00:28:52,125 --> 00:28:53,541
Please, sit, no formalities.

359
00:28:53,625 --> 00:28:55,958
We'll collect the ashes
from the crematorium

360
00:28:56,041 --> 00:28:59,250
and head straight for Kanpur
to pour the ashes into the holy Ganges.

361
00:28:59,333 --> 00:29:00,458
All right. Let's go.

362
00:29:01,333 --> 00:29:02,541
What will you guys do there?

363
00:29:03,083 --> 00:29:05,333
The four of us are enough.

364
00:29:08,416 --> 00:29:09,500
Your wallet.

365
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,500
He said not to bother.

366
00:29:17,666 --> 00:29:18,916
That's the agreement, yes?

367
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Okay.

368
00:29:21,083 --> 00:29:24,375
Okay, we will see you in 30 minutes.

369
00:29:25,583 --> 00:29:26,708
Did you find the receipt?

370
00:29:27,791 --> 00:29:28,875
No, I gave it to Alok.

371
00:29:31,041 --> 00:29:32,041
He's looking for it.

372
00:29:32,083 --> 00:29:33,708
You guys are very careless.

373
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:36,833
Which receipt, <i>Tayaji?</i>

374
00:29:36,916 --> 00:29:39,416
The one we got
from the crematorium with the pyre number,

375
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:43,333
to make sure we get Astik's ashes.

376
00:29:43,416 --> 00:29:46,000
That receipt? I have it.

377
00:29:46,083 --> 00:29:48,833
Couldn't you tell one of us?

378
00:29:48,916 --> 00:29:51,708
We're going to be late,
and you're goofing around on the ladder.

379
00:29:51,791 --> 00:29:54,291
You asked me to change the bell, old man.
That's what...

380
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:56,666
Don't argue with me.
Go check if Alok is ready.

381
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:59,250
Come on, go!

382
00:30:01,458 --> 00:30:02,875
And you, take the ladder away.

383
00:30:02,958 --> 00:30:03,958
Take it away!

384
00:30:05,041 --> 00:30:07,125
Don't change this bell now.
Remove the ladder!

385
00:30:07,833 --> 00:30:11,958
Alok, have you put on your pants yet?

386
00:30:14,875 --> 00:30:16,958
These morons don't value time.

387
00:30:17,041 --> 00:30:19,250
They are lazing around.

388
00:30:19,333 --> 00:30:21,166
Your family is extremely disorganized.

389
00:30:23,666 --> 00:30:26,541
If we didn't need to go,
they could have informed us yesterday.

390
00:30:26,625 --> 00:30:28,958
I woke up early and got ready for nothing.

391
00:30:38,333 --> 00:30:39,333
Grandma.

392
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:43,125
I am going to tell you something.

393
00:30:45,208 --> 00:30:46,833
But you can't tell anyone, okay?

394
00:30:59,333 --> 00:31:00,333
Look.

395
00:31:01,583 --> 00:31:03,000
Astik's girlfriend.

396
00:31:04,041 --> 00:31:05,708
She's nothing special.

397
00:31:10,916 --> 00:31:12,250
I mean, her nose is weird.

398
00:31:15,666 --> 00:31:16,750
She isn't fair.

399
00:31:21,416 --> 00:31:23,166
She doesn't look
that well-educated either.

400
00:31:24,708 --> 00:31:26,375
Definitely hasn't done an MA.

401
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,625
Do you know her?

402
00:31:38,708 --> 00:31:39,916
Who is she, Grandma?

403
00:31:40,458 --> 00:31:41,583
Usha.

404
00:31:44,625 --> 00:31:47,291
Come on, kid, hurry up.
We are really late.

405
00:31:47,375 --> 00:31:48,958
Finally draped your <i>dhoti?</i>

406
00:31:49,041 --> 00:31:50,041
Let's go.

407
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:54,958
Mom, I have to pee.

408
00:31:55,041 --> 00:31:58,666
Why did you drink so much water?
I already told you not to.

409
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,916
Hi, Tarun.

410
00:32:12,125 --> 00:32:13,583
No, son.

411
00:32:14,916 --> 00:32:16,916
You don't touch feet
during the mourning period.

412
00:32:18,083 --> 00:32:20,166
- That's Tarun's son?
- Yup.

413
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Aditya.

414
00:32:23,375 --> 00:32:25,666
- What does he do?
- He is jobless.

415
00:32:27,083 --> 00:32:29,208
But trying to start a restaurant.

416
00:32:29,291 --> 00:32:32,125
He came to my husband for a loan.

417
00:32:32,208 --> 00:32:34,291
Mom, where's the washroom?

418
00:32:35,125 --> 00:32:37,833
That... tin door there.

419
00:32:46,208 --> 00:32:48,750
Tarun, you've come quite late.

420
00:32:50,875 --> 00:32:53,416
You should ask Shivendra about that.

421
00:32:54,666 --> 00:32:56,875
I don't even know if he wanted me to come.

422
00:33:00,958 --> 00:33:02,333
That's not the case, Tarun.

423
00:33:03,041 --> 00:33:04,500
Let it be, <i>Bhai Sahab.</i>

424
00:33:04,583 --> 00:33:06,625
This isn't the time for this conversation.

425
00:33:07,916 --> 00:33:09,583
But I don't think you consider me family.

426
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:11,625
But what's the matter?

427
00:33:12,708 --> 00:33:13,833
Ask him.

428
00:33:14,916 --> 00:33:15,916
Did he inform me?

429
00:33:16,375 --> 00:33:18,458
Such a huge thing happened in the family,

430
00:33:19,333 --> 00:33:21,041
and he didn't even think to tell me.

431
00:33:23,166 --> 00:33:24,833
It wasn't intentional, Tarun.

432
00:33:26,375 --> 00:33:28,166
This isn't the first time
you've ignored me.

433
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:31,250
You've had an issue with me
for 15 years,

434
00:33:31,833 --> 00:33:33,833
since I got my job
at the Income Tax Department.

435
00:33:33,916 --> 00:33:36,666
My wife, Rashmi, so lovingly
made a family WhatsApp group,

436
00:33:38,375 --> 00:33:40,166
but he left that, too.

437
00:33:46,333 --> 00:33:48,791
You've come here
to mourn or to pick a fight?

438
00:33:48,875 --> 00:33:50,375
You're the one who started it.

439
00:33:51,166 --> 00:33:52,541
That's enough.

440
00:33:52,625 --> 00:33:55,833
Go get settled in. We're going to
collect Astik's ashes. We'll talk later.

441
00:33:55,916 --> 00:33:56,916
I'll come along.

442
00:33:56,958 --> 00:34:00,208
There is no space in the car now.
You should've come earlier.

443
00:34:00,291 --> 00:34:01,416
Let's go.

444
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:02,666
<i>Bhai...</i>

445
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:06,208
Let's go. Hope the driver's still here.

446
00:34:08,708 --> 00:34:10,166
What were you doing in there?

447
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:13,875
Baking cookies.

448
00:34:15,333 --> 00:34:17,208
Get out of my way. "Baking cookies."

449
00:34:20,833 --> 00:34:22,000
What are you looking for?

450
00:34:22,541 --> 00:34:24,625
There was a packet of chips here.

451
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:27,166
I ate them last night.

452
00:34:42,541 --> 00:34:43,666
Want to eat some golgappas?

453
00:34:45,125 --> 00:34:46,125
I want to eat.

454
00:34:47,583 --> 00:34:49,625
I want to go out and eat golgappas.

455
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:53,833
Sandhya, you've seriously lost it.
You're making no sense.

456
00:34:53,916 --> 00:34:56,083
Why? Astik can do
all the nonsense he wants,

457
00:34:56,166 --> 00:34:58,000
and I can't even eat golgappas?

458
00:34:58,083 --> 00:34:59,708
What has Astik done?

459
00:35:04,916 --> 00:35:06,375
You want to come with me or not?

460
00:35:06,458 --> 00:35:08,333
Will they even allow you to go out?

461
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:09,625
Let's see.

462
00:35:09,708 --> 00:35:13,000
Get off the phone
and tell me how this pattern is looking.

463
00:35:13,083 --> 00:35:14,791
Did Ghanshyam eat before he left?

464
00:35:14,875 --> 00:35:17,125
It takes time
to process requests at a bank.

465
00:35:17,208 --> 00:35:19,458
Don't worry. He won't take much time.

466
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:21,708
He's an expert.

467
00:35:23,666 --> 00:35:27,750
Remember, just two weeks ago,
his uncle passed away.

468
00:35:28,875 --> 00:35:30,500
He handled all the paperwork then, too.

469
00:35:36,166 --> 00:35:37,166
You know what, Tulika?

470
00:35:38,666 --> 00:35:40,708
Sometimes when we don't have something,

471
00:35:41,375 --> 00:35:43,250
we don't want
other people to have it either.

472
00:35:50,083 --> 00:35:51,916
Rinku, listen.

473
00:35:53,416 --> 00:35:56,500
You know how Janaki is.
Why are you paying attention to her?

474
00:35:57,250 --> 00:35:59,666
They're not even
capable of bearing a child,

475
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:01,041
and she's taking jabs at me.

476
00:36:01,125 --> 00:36:03,625
- Mom.
- What happened, sweetie? Need something?

477
00:36:03,708 --> 00:36:06,500
Mom, I'm going
to visit the doctor with Nazia.

478
00:36:07,541 --> 00:36:09,583
What's the matter?
Is everything all right?

479
00:36:09,666 --> 00:36:12,416
My stomach
has been aching since last night.

480
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:14,125
Do you have a fever?

481
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:16,708
No, just a stomachache
and a little uneasiness.

482
00:36:16,791 --> 00:36:20,250
Okay. Shall I come?

483
00:36:20,333 --> 00:36:22,500
Or better yet, we can call Dr. Ali home.

484
00:36:22,583 --> 00:36:25,666
No, it's okay. Nazia can take me.
It's just a stomachache.

485
00:36:26,416 --> 00:36:28,416
But, sweetie,
it's better if someone goes along.

486
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,500
Why are you forcing her, <i>Jiji?</i>

487
00:36:31,125 --> 00:36:33,541
You can't keep her
locked up at home, away from the world.

488
00:36:36,583 --> 00:36:39,583
Fine, you go.
I'll call Dr. Ali and inform him.

489
00:36:39,666 --> 00:36:41,166
- Okay.
- Go.

490
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:43,875
Listen, take some money.

491
00:36:43,958 --> 00:36:47,041
- No, Mother, I have money.
- Just in case you need it, take it.

492
00:36:57,791 --> 00:36:58,666
Now?

493
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:02,125
Now what?
First the doctor, then golgappas.

494
00:37:02,791 --> 00:37:03,708
Let's go.

495
00:37:03,791 --> 00:37:06,833
[chanting and praying]

496
00:37:13,791 --> 00:37:15,958
Here to immerse the ashes
in the holy Ganges?

497
00:37:16,041 --> 00:37:18,208
Come with me, sir.

498
00:37:40,791 --> 00:37:45,125
Sir, tell us whose ashes those are.
Your mother? Father? We can offer a deal.

499
00:37:53,166 --> 00:37:54,916
They are my son's ashes.

500
00:37:57,625 --> 00:38:01,916
Do you have...
any special discounts for that?

501
00:38:04,541 --> 00:38:08,208
ASGAR ALI'S DISPENSARY

502
00:38:15,291 --> 00:38:17,125
- Sandhya Giri.
- Yes, that's me.

503
00:38:17,208 --> 00:38:18,291
Come. You're next.

504
00:38:31,666 --> 00:38:34,541
Parchun, wait here
and keep an eye on the shoes.

505
00:38:34,625 --> 00:38:36,458
This place is full of petty thieves.

506
00:38:36,541 --> 00:38:37,541
Stay here.

507
00:38:38,083 --> 00:38:41,583
[chanting and praying]

508
00:38:43,875 --> 00:38:45,333
Put your right hand forward.

509
00:38:45,416 --> 00:38:46,416
For the oath.

510
00:38:57,041 --> 00:38:58,166
<i>Name of the deceased?</i>

511
00:38:59,083 --> 00:39:00,125
Astik Giri.

512
00:39:10,166 --> 00:39:11,208
Make it extra spicy.

513
00:39:22,875 --> 00:39:25,541
Aren't you scared
that someone might see us here, Sandhya?

514
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,333
I'm not thinking about it.

515
00:39:29,125 --> 00:39:30,875
Then what are you thinking about?

516
00:39:34,041 --> 00:39:35,916
Sir, I've arranged for a nice boat.

517
00:39:36,625 --> 00:39:39,375
We will go to the middle
of the holy Ganges and immerse the ashes.

518
00:39:39,458 --> 00:39:41,500
We're not here for a boat ride.

519
00:39:41,583 --> 00:39:44,500
Why do we need to go in that far?
We can immerse the ashes anywhere.

520
00:39:44,583 --> 00:39:46,833
Sir, you're scared
of going far into the holy Ganges.

521
00:39:46,916 --> 00:39:50,291
Imagine how far the soul has to travel.

522
00:39:50,375 --> 00:39:51,833
What do you mean?

523
00:39:51,916 --> 00:39:54,000
There was once a man,

524
00:39:54,083 --> 00:39:57,666
evil, greedy, cunning,

525
00:39:57,750 --> 00:39:59,875
used to letch on other's wives.

526
00:40:04,083 --> 00:40:05,833
I found it in Astik's cupboard.

527
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:11,916
<i>One day he went to the jungle
and fell prey to a tiger.</i>

528
00:40:12,625 --> 00:40:16,750
<i>Yamdoot arrived immediately
to escort his soul to Yamlok.</i>

529
00:40:18,708 --> 00:40:23,125
In Yamlok, Chitragupt started accounting
for that man's ill deeds

530
00:40:23,958 --> 00:40:26,541
and sentenced him
to a list of punishments in hell.

531
00:40:27,625 --> 00:40:29,041
To be bitten by snakes,

532
00:40:30,291 --> 00:40:33,625
to be drowned in boiling oil, whiplashes,

533
00:40:34,791 --> 00:40:37,250
pain and torture.

534
00:40:39,333 --> 00:40:43,208
<i>Pandit ji,</i> what's the need to go further?
Let's immerse the ashes here.

535
00:40:43,291 --> 00:40:45,375
Don't worry, sir.
Listen to the whole story.

536
00:40:48,208 --> 00:40:49,500
I want to meet this girl.

537
00:40:51,208 --> 00:40:52,666
What's the point in that?

538
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:55,500
I don't know.

539
00:40:55,583 --> 00:40:57,250
<i>Meanwhile, here on Earth,</i>

540
00:40:57,333 --> 00:40:59,125
<i>his corpse lay rotting.</i>

541
00:41:00,041 --> 00:41:02,541
<i>Suddenly, an eagle came</i>

542
00:41:03,458 --> 00:41:06,791
<i>and took a bone from his body
and flew up into the sky.</i>

543
00:41:07,791 --> 00:41:10,958
<i>Another eagle, upon seeing the bone,</i>

544
00:41:11,625 --> 00:41:14,125
<i>tried to snatch it away.</i>

545
00:41:15,833 --> 00:41:18,208
<i>Both the eagles
started fighting over that bone,</i>

546
00:41:18,291 --> 00:41:20,583
<i>and while doing so,
they flew over the holy Ganges.</i>

547
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:26,500
<i>Suddenly, the bone fell out
of their beaks and into the holy Ganges.</i>

548
00:41:28,125 --> 00:41:31,583
<i>Astik will be cursed for this.
His soul will never find peace.</i>

549
00:41:31,666 --> 00:41:33,625
Come on. Why curse the departed?

550
00:41:33,708 --> 00:41:36,166
Whatever may have happened,
he was your husband.

551
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:38,208
So you can forgive him.

552
00:41:38,291 --> 00:41:39,666
Only I can forgive him.

553
00:41:44,166 --> 00:41:45,208
But why should I?

554
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:48,375
Let him hang from this tree forever.

555
00:41:48,458 --> 00:41:49,291
Sandhya...

556
00:41:49,375 --> 00:41:51,583
And as soon as the bone
fell into the holy Ganges,

557
00:41:51,666 --> 00:41:54,166
all the misdeeds
of that sinner were washed away.

558
00:41:56,333 --> 00:41:58,958
And Yamaraj
had to send him to heaven.

559
00:42:00,291 --> 00:42:03,500
And that's the purpose behind
immersing the ashes into the holy Ganges.

560
00:42:05,375 --> 00:42:10,500
Mom, we immersed the ashes
right in the middle of the holy Ganges.

561
00:42:11,625 --> 00:42:14,875
So Astik's sins
have all been washed clean.

562
00:42:16,291 --> 00:42:17,750
My brother is now in heaven.

563
00:42:21,250 --> 00:42:25,375
<i>A lifetime of theft,
robbery, rape and selfish motives.</i>

564
00:42:27,791 --> 00:42:30,875
All washed clean if your ashes
are immersed in the holy Ganges.

565
00:42:31,916 --> 00:42:33,041
How is that fair?

566
00:42:34,083 --> 00:42:35,916
How can the holy Ganges forgive?

567
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,708
Did he marry the holy Ganges or me?

568
00:43:02,166 --> 00:43:05,000
- Sit up straight.
- I am.

569
00:43:05,083 --> 00:43:08,541
You're not. I'm trying to braid your hair.
It's like a jungle.

570
00:43:09,875 --> 00:43:11,500
- Adi.
- Yes?

571
00:43:12,375 --> 00:43:14,750
Have you spoken to
Ghanshyam Uncle about your bank loan?

572
00:43:16,041 --> 00:43:18,333
Mother, this isn't the time for that.

573
00:43:18,416 --> 00:43:19,416
Why not?

574
00:43:20,208 --> 00:43:22,708
Are we supposed to
just sit and sulk till the wake?

575
00:43:22,791 --> 00:43:26,416
Fine. I'll speak to him. Anyway, there'll
be enough time in the next few days.

576
00:43:27,166 --> 00:43:28,958
How long do we have to stay?

577
00:43:29,041 --> 00:43:31,541
I've told you.
For all 13 days of the wake.

578
00:43:31,625 --> 00:43:33,541
What will I do here for so many days?

579
00:43:34,458 --> 00:43:36,875
You've got your books, right? So study.

580
00:43:37,458 --> 00:43:38,708
Ma, study here?

581
00:43:40,125 --> 00:43:42,875
Those who need to study
will do so under street lamps if needed.

582
00:43:42,958 --> 00:43:45,250
Please, kids who claim
to have studied under street lamps,

583
00:43:45,333 --> 00:43:46,708
usually end up in politics,

584
00:43:46,791 --> 00:43:48,541
because they're pathological liars.

585
00:43:48,625 --> 00:43:50,541
What are you saying?

586
00:43:51,833 --> 00:43:53,913
- Now, where are you off to?
- To find a street lamp.

587
00:44:33,375 --> 00:44:35,500
What the hell? You scared me.

588
00:44:35,583 --> 00:44:36,625
Are you stalking me?

589
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:41,750
Not much else to do here,
so I just followed you.

590
00:44:43,208 --> 00:44:44,375
What grade are you in?

591
00:44:47,541 --> 00:44:49,625
- Ninth.
- I'm in tenth.

592
00:44:52,541 --> 00:44:53,541
So?

593
00:44:54,375 --> 00:44:56,958
So, kiddo, you're younger.

594
00:44:57,541 --> 00:45:00,250
Maintain distance and respect. Understand?

595
00:45:04,083 --> 00:45:05,583
Is the cucumber for me?

596
00:45:09,958 --> 00:45:11,250
Well then, offer me some.

597
00:45:30,041 --> 00:45:31,750
I have downloaded the form.

598
00:45:31,833 --> 00:45:34,250
Will everything be online?

599
00:45:35,166 --> 00:45:38,041
Sandhya <i>Didi,</i>
Pappu <i>Tayaji</i> has called for you.

600
00:45:40,791 --> 00:45:41,833
You carry on, I'll come.

601
00:45:43,416 --> 00:45:46,875
Sandhya, a few of
Astik's colleagues have come to meet you.

602
00:45:49,125 --> 00:45:50,125
Hello, ma'am.

603
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,791
We are very sorry for your loss.

604
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:55,083
We'll all miss him.

605
00:45:55,166 --> 00:45:57,083
He was a very good man.

606
00:45:57,166 --> 00:45:59,708
He was a very good man.

607
00:46:16,958 --> 00:46:18,000
Sandhya...

608
00:46:22,083 --> 00:46:24,666
- You are?
- Akansha.

609
00:46:26,208 --> 00:46:27,708
Astik's colleague.

610
00:46:28,791 --> 00:46:30,625
- I am so sorry for your...
- Akansha.

611
00:46:31,916 --> 00:46:34,875
Akansha, I would like to speak to you.

612
00:46:36,333 --> 00:46:39,666
Mom, I found
some of Astik's work documents.

613
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:41,250
I'll just hand those over to her.

614
00:46:57,458 --> 00:46:58,458
Please sit.

615
00:47:18,250 --> 00:47:19,833
Which documents were you talking about?

616
00:47:41,125 --> 00:47:42,875
Astik kept it safe.

617
00:47:48,875 --> 00:47:50,375
So you really did love him, right?

618
00:47:58,041 --> 00:47:59,416
I never had a hint of suspicion.

619
00:48:04,750 --> 00:48:06,291
It's not...

620
00:48:08,750 --> 00:48:10,208
It's not what you think.

621
00:48:12,666 --> 00:48:13,666
He never...

622
00:48:18,958 --> 00:48:21,083
Astik never cheated on you.

623
00:48:21,166 --> 00:48:23,125
What's the point of lying now?

624
00:48:23,208 --> 00:48:24,916
I'm not lying.

625
00:48:30,708 --> 00:48:31,875
We did love each other.

626
00:48:33,416 --> 00:48:34,750
But after you got married,

627
00:48:35,541 --> 00:48:37,291
we were just colleagues.

628
00:48:39,041 --> 00:48:40,041
Nothing more.

629
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,500
How long had you known him?

630
00:48:56,166 --> 00:48:57,750
We were in college together.

631
00:48:59,541 --> 00:49:00,750
Met the very first year.

632
00:49:03,125 --> 00:49:05,250
Then got jobs at the same company.

633
00:49:05,333 --> 00:49:07,041
Then why didn't you marry him?

634
00:49:08,791 --> 00:49:10,333
My parents didn't approve.

635
00:49:11,250 --> 00:49:13,416
You refused to marry him
just to please your family?

636
00:49:14,583 --> 00:49:17,416
And you also agreed to marry him
just to please your family.

637
00:49:19,583 --> 00:49:21,375
But he did still love you.

638
00:49:22,708 --> 00:49:25,041
Even now, he kept your photograph safe.

639
00:49:26,208 --> 00:49:27,208
How about you?

640
00:49:40,416 --> 00:49:41,416
Sorry.

641
00:49:44,791 --> 00:49:45,791
Akansha,

642
00:49:47,333 --> 00:49:50,750
I know I have no right to question you.

643
00:49:52,541 --> 00:49:55,458
But the person
who does owe me an explanation is now...

644
00:49:59,208 --> 00:50:01,625
Even if he was around,
what would I have said to him?

645
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:05,583
We rarely spoke.

646
00:50:12,375 --> 00:50:14,041
His tastes were different.

647
00:50:19,416 --> 00:50:21,541
<i>Once, I gifted him a shirt,</i>

648
00:50:22,458 --> 00:50:23,833
<i>a beautiful printed one.</i>

649
00:50:25,916 --> 00:50:30,083
<i>He didn't wear it even once.
He just stuck to his usual office shirts.</i>

650
00:50:31,416 --> 00:50:32,458
Formal.

651
00:50:34,083 --> 00:50:35,083
Blue.

652
00:50:35,708 --> 00:50:36,958
His favorite color.

653
00:50:39,416 --> 00:50:41,541
What happened, Sandhya?
What's all this on the bed?

654
00:50:42,541 --> 00:50:43,541
Blue...

655
00:50:45,291 --> 00:50:47,541
Astik's favorite color was blue.

656
00:50:48,583 --> 00:50:52,500
All his shirts, T-shirts...
Everything is blue.

657
00:51:03,750 --> 00:51:05,041
She was right.

658
00:51:06,291 --> 00:51:07,291
Who?

659
00:51:24,541 --> 00:51:28,791
"Akansha Roy. Vice President Marketing."

660
00:51:33,750 --> 00:51:35,708
Your shawl is on the bed.

661
00:51:47,416 --> 00:51:48,625
Listen.

662
00:51:55,916 --> 00:51:57,208
What is it?

663
00:51:58,666 --> 00:51:59,791
Astik...

664
00:52:02,708 --> 00:52:04,375
It will be okay.

665
00:52:06,041 --> 00:52:08,708
<i>Guru ji </i>has said, "It'll all be okay."

666
00:52:09,750 --> 00:52:11,791
"The almighty tests us."

667
00:52:12,541 --> 00:52:15,041
"We must accept his wishes."

668
00:52:25,875 --> 00:52:27,333
Please, listen to me.

669
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,000
What is it?

670
00:52:35,583 --> 00:52:38,250
There's so much that he left unfinished.

671
00:52:40,791 --> 00:52:42,708
How will we run the house ourselves?

672
00:52:43,416 --> 00:52:46,375
Especially with the home loan to repay.

673
00:52:47,250 --> 00:52:48,333
So...

674
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:53,500
why don't you tell your <i>guru ji</i>...

675
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,750
to send Astik back?

676
00:53:00,125 --> 00:53:01,625
So he can repay the loans.

677
00:53:42,750 --> 00:53:43,750
I'll open the door.

678
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:51,500
Alok.

679
00:53:52,875 --> 00:53:55,083
You're allowed out of your room?

680
00:53:56,583 --> 00:53:58,958
Why? You won't go report
to Pappu <i>Tayaji,</i> will you?

681
00:53:59,041 --> 00:54:00,416
Why should I care?

682
00:54:02,625 --> 00:54:05,916
Okay. I have something urgent
I need to do with you.

683
00:54:06,583 --> 00:54:07,750
Tell me.

684
00:54:10,833 --> 00:54:14,875
We need to publish
Astik's obituary in the newspaper.

685
00:54:15,458 --> 00:54:18,041
<i>Babaji </i>asked me to write it in English.

686
00:54:18,666 --> 00:54:21,791
I thought I'd run it by you.

687
00:54:22,583 --> 00:54:23,583
Read it out.

688
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:27,250
Why don't you read it yourself?

689
00:54:27,958 --> 00:54:32,666
No, you go ahead.
I can't read your handwriting.

690
00:54:32,750 --> 00:54:35,875
It looks like a drunk ant
crawled through ink on your notebook.

691
00:54:37,166 --> 00:54:40,166
Come on. It isn't that bad.

692
00:54:49,416 --> 00:54:50,583
I've written...

693
00:54:50,666 --> 00:54:52,875
"With heavy grief, we inform..."

694
00:54:52,958 --> 00:54:54,916
Not "heavy." "Profound."

695
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,166
"Profound..."

696
00:54:56,958 --> 00:54:58,708
Pro... found.

697
00:54:59,833 --> 00:55:00,833
It means deep.

698
00:55:01,333 --> 00:55:03,125
Profound.

699
00:55:03,875 --> 00:55:07,750
"With profound grief, we inform you
of the death of our respected..."

700
00:55:07,833 --> 00:55:09,500
Change that to "demise."

701
00:55:10,458 --> 00:55:12,416
Change "profound"?

702
00:55:13,333 --> 00:55:16,375
No. Change "death" to "demise."
"Death" doesn't sound good.

703
00:55:21,416 --> 00:55:24,916
Yeah. Go on, write. S-E...

704
00:55:28,958 --> 00:55:31,333
"With profound grief, we inform you

705
00:55:31,416 --> 00:55:33,708
of the demise
of our respected Astik Giri..."

706
00:55:33,791 --> 00:55:34,958
Not "respected."

707
00:55:36,458 --> 00:55:37,458
"Beloved."

708
00:55:39,125 --> 00:55:42,041
But beloved is used for girls.

709
00:55:43,750 --> 00:55:45,666
It can be used for boys as well.

710
00:55:49,333 --> 00:55:53,000
"Beloved Astik Giri."

711
00:55:53,083 --> 00:55:56,708
Listen. You leave your notebook with me.
I'll rewrite it properly.

712
00:55:57,458 --> 00:55:58,750
Okay.

713
00:56:00,250 --> 00:56:02,583
This needs to be
submitted tomorrow morning.

714
00:56:04,083 --> 00:56:05,083
Okay.

715
00:56:12,083 --> 00:56:13,083
<i>Bhabhi...</i>

716
00:56:15,041 --> 00:56:17,750
Let me know if you need anything.

717
00:56:27,875 --> 00:56:29,291
Stop here.

718
00:56:30,916 --> 00:56:34,541
- Sandhya, I'll come along with you.
- No. I'll be fine. You carry on.

719
00:56:41,416 --> 00:56:42,416
Sorry.

720
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:45,875
I called you to meet on a workday.
Must've been busy in the office, right?

721
00:56:45,958 --> 00:56:47,583
No, come, that's fine.

722
00:56:50,041 --> 00:56:51,666
Sit. Please, sit.

723
00:56:53,791 --> 00:56:56,416
I've been meaning to talk to you myself.

724
00:56:57,166 --> 00:56:59,416
Really? Why? What about?

725
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,541
I've been feeling so guilty.

726
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:04,875
Believe me, Sandhya...

727
00:57:04,958 --> 00:57:07,791
We hardly spoke
after you both got married.

728
00:57:08,625 --> 00:57:09,916
We didn't speak much either.

729
00:57:10,708 --> 00:57:12,916
But I just assumed this is how it is.

730
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,250
People fall in and out of love in college.

731
00:57:16,375 --> 00:57:18,791
But I was never able to.
I was always too scared.

732
00:57:18,875 --> 00:57:19,916
I thought...

733
00:57:21,583 --> 00:57:23,916
maybe Astik also
didn't understand love, just like me.

734
00:57:31,791 --> 00:57:35,541
But having met you, I realize now
that he was quite the romantic.

735
00:57:36,125 --> 00:57:37,333
Wasn't he?

736
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:45,500
Your order, ma'am?

737
00:57:47,083 --> 00:57:48,250
Yeah...

738
00:57:49,333 --> 00:57:50,333
I'll have a cappuccino.

739
00:57:50,375 --> 00:57:52,666
- Yeah, Sandhya?
- Same.

740
00:57:52,750 --> 00:57:54,041
Two cappuccinos.

741
00:57:54,125 --> 00:57:55,125
Okay, ma'am.

742
00:57:58,541 --> 00:57:59,791
Tell me.

743
00:58:00,375 --> 00:58:02,791
I won't feel bad at all, I promise.

744
00:58:04,625 --> 00:58:09,000
In person... he was not that expressive,

745
00:58:09,833 --> 00:58:15,708
but on Valentine's Day,
cards, WhatsApp messages, emails...

746
00:58:15,791 --> 00:58:17,750
He wrote a lot of romantic rubbish.

747
00:58:19,250 --> 00:58:20,916
You guys met in the office every day?

748
00:58:24,833 --> 00:58:26,833
And you went out for dates too, right?

749
00:58:29,583 --> 00:58:30,875
Before he...

750
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:35,208
Before you both got married.

751
00:58:36,250 --> 00:58:38,000
Where did you guys go together?

752
00:58:41,041 --> 00:58:42,541
Why are you asking these questions?

753
00:58:43,541 --> 00:58:44,708
I don't know.

754
00:58:45,541 --> 00:58:47,125
I just want to know.

755
00:58:48,750 --> 00:58:50,583
Where would you two go?

756
00:58:51,125 --> 00:58:54,125
What did you talk about? Everything.

757
00:58:55,375 --> 00:58:56,791
I was his wife.

758
00:58:58,541 --> 00:59:01,208
I'm just asking you
to share some old memories.

759
00:59:03,208 --> 00:59:04,708
If that's possible.

760
00:59:08,041 --> 00:59:12,333
[chanting and praying]

761
00:59:27,541 --> 00:59:33,750
<i>I'm suffering a little less</i>

762
00:59:40,625 --> 00:59:45,250
<i>I'm not a stranger anymore</i>

763
00:59:46,375 --> 00:59:51,750
<i>My heart has opened up</i>

764
00:59:51,833 --> 00:59:53,958
<i>To new hopes</i>

765
00:59:54,041 --> 00:59:55,458
- Hello, ma'am.
- Hi. Good morning.

766
00:59:58,208 --> 01:00:03,375
<i>I'm not a stranger anymore</i>

767
01:00:03,458 --> 01:00:07,208
<i>I'm not a stranger anymore</i>

768
01:00:07,833 --> 01:00:12,000
<i>I have some new hopes</i>

769
01:00:12,083 --> 01:00:17,875
<i>These little happinesses</i>

770
01:00:17,958 --> 01:00:21,583
<i>Were hiding inside me</i>

771
01:00:26,791 --> 01:00:30,250
<i>I'm not a stranger anymore</i>

772
01:00:30,333 --> 01:00:34,250
<i>I love my life now</i>

773
01:01:02,625 --> 01:01:04,166
That's Usha's <i>guru ji.</i>

774
01:01:04,250 --> 01:01:05,250
Yes.

775
01:01:05,625 --> 01:01:07,583
It was my idea to call him.

776
01:01:07,666 --> 01:01:10,833
A discourse on the Bhagavad Gita
helps calm the restless mind.

777
01:01:10,916 --> 01:01:12,750
- Idiot.
- Why are you hitting me?

778
01:01:12,833 --> 01:01:17,375
What does he attain?
He attains <i>Vaishnav padh.</i>

779
01:01:18,416 --> 01:01:20,666
He has a divine aura.

780
01:01:21,416 --> 01:01:22,416
Aura?

781
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:36,916
<i>Hey, birdie</i>

782
01:01:38,375 --> 01:01:44,791
<i>Hey, birdie
Hey, birdie</i>

783
01:01:44,875 --> 01:01:51,708
<i>Speaking new words to me</i>

784
01:01:52,208 --> 01:01:56,500
<i>My heart smiles for no reason</i>

785
01:01:56,583 --> 01:02:03,333
<i>My heart is acting</i>

786
01:02:03,416 --> 01:02:07,916
<i>Crazy and stubborn</i>

787
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:14,875
<i>I refused, he agreed</i>

788
01:02:14,958 --> 01:02:17,791
<i>The sunshine and shadows</i>

789
01:02:17,875 --> 01:02:23,708
<i>Are one now</i>

790
01:02:23,791 --> 01:02:29,041
<i>I've found a way</i>

791
01:02:29,125 --> 01:02:33,458
<i>That leads to you</i>

792
01:02:33,541 --> 01:02:37,625
<i>I have new hopes now</i>

793
01:02:37,708 --> 01:02:43,291
<i>These little happinesses</i>

794
01:02:43,791 --> 01:02:47,541
<i>Were hiding inside me</i>

795
01:02:52,625 --> 01:02:55,833
<i>I'm not a stranger anymore</i>

796
01:02:55,916 --> 01:03:00,416
<i>I love my life now</i>

797
01:03:15,458 --> 01:03:18,916
Aditi, listen to me, please. What's wrong?

798
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,541
I told you, not on the lips.

799
01:03:22,041 --> 01:03:24,416
Yeah, but this is how it is done, right?

800
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:26,166
Technically, we are related.

801
01:03:26,250 --> 01:03:29,583
Yeah, but very distant cousins, no?

802
01:03:31,083 --> 01:03:33,625
Fair enough. Okay, but just this once.

803
01:03:35,250 --> 01:03:36,333
Okay.

804
01:03:47,791 --> 01:03:48,791
That's an enema.

805
01:03:50,916 --> 01:03:53,083
It helps ease her stomachaches.

806
01:03:55,333 --> 01:03:57,000
Just remember to wash your hands later.

807
01:03:57,958 --> 01:03:58,958
Yes.

808
01:03:59,541 --> 01:04:02,333
Did your father tell you
to sit here with Grandma?

809
01:04:02,416 --> 01:04:05,791
- No, I just wanted to.
- Usha!

810
01:04:06,958 --> 01:04:10,125
- Please, let me. I'll feed her.
- No, you won't be able to.

811
01:04:10,208 --> 01:04:13,208
- Usha!
- Coming, wait a minute.

812
01:04:13,875 --> 01:04:15,416
Mom, do you have an antacid pill?

813
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:17,750
Nazia's stomach is upset
because of restaurant food.

814
01:04:17,833 --> 01:04:20,375
Yeah, I'll give you the pill in a second.

815
01:04:20,458 --> 01:04:23,083
But can you feed Grandma please?

816
01:04:23,166 --> 01:04:25,208
- He's calling out for me repeatedly.
- Usha!

817
01:04:29,291 --> 01:04:30,666
Usha!

818
01:04:32,625 --> 01:04:34,708
Can you get food sent upstairs for Alok?

819
01:04:35,541 --> 01:04:39,250
And then ask the caterer
to serve us as well. It's getting late.

820
01:04:44,333 --> 01:04:46,166
- Giri<i> ji.</i>
- Yeah?

821
01:04:47,458 --> 01:04:49,458
Whatever has happened is heartbreaking.

822
01:04:49,541 --> 01:04:53,833
But right now, we must remember
to focus on Sandhya's future.

823
01:04:54,416 --> 01:04:56,750
Sandhya has her whole life ahead of her.

824
01:04:56,833 --> 01:04:58,000
Why should she live alone?

825
01:04:58,958 --> 01:05:03,708
We are quite open-minded
about such things. Have some.

826
01:05:03,791 --> 01:05:05,708
After all, we live in the modern era.

827
01:05:05,791 --> 01:05:09,000
If Sandhya wishes to, she can remarry.

828
01:05:10,666 --> 01:05:13,506
- What nonsense are you talking, Tarun?
- It's not nonsense, <i>Bhai Sahab.</i>

829
01:05:13,541 --> 01:05:17,791
Look, Sandhya's a nice girl
with a good education.

830
01:05:18,333 --> 01:05:20,083
She will easily find some good suitors.

831
01:05:20,666 --> 01:05:22,083
Newchance.com.

832
01:05:26,458 --> 01:05:29,875
There are many such sites on the Internet
exclusively for divorcees and widowers.

833
01:05:31,416 --> 01:05:33,041
If you approve,

834
01:05:33,125 --> 01:05:36,041
I can create a profile for her.

835
01:05:40,125 --> 01:05:41,125
Usha.

836
01:05:43,166 --> 01:05:44,333
That should be enough.

837
01:05:46,375 --> 01:05:47,375
Sandhya<i> ji.</i>

838
01:06:04,083 --> 01:06:06,750
- Move. You're in the middle of the road.
- Just go, man.

839
01:06:22,583 --> 01:06:23,583
Parchun.

840
01:06:24,458 --> 01:06:25,916
You replaced the doorbell with this?

841
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:29,750
<i>Tayaji,</i> you only gave me 50 rupees.
This all you get for 50 rupees.

842
01:06:29,833 --> 01:06:31,291
"All you get for 50 rupees."

843
01:06:32,416 --> 01:06:34,541
Jhumri, see who's at the door.

844
01:06:39,458 --> 01:06:40,458
Shibu!

845
01:06:41,208 --> 01:06:42,500
Can I check the door?

846
01:06:43,291 --> 01:06:45,625
No, let Jhumri do it. You sit with me.

847
01:06:45,708 --> 01:06:48,500
The priest has sent
the shopping list for the wake.

848
01:06:48,583 --> 01:06:50,583
Let me explain it to you.

849
01:06:50,666 --> 01:06:51,791
Please, come.

850
01:07:05,708 --> 01:07:09,458
- If you don't understand...
- <i>Tayaji,</i> he's here to meet Sandhya.

851
01:07:09,541 --> 01:07:12,166
Hello, I'm B.K. Arora.

852
01:07:12,250 --> 01:07:14,375
Mr. Arora. Hello!

853
01:07:14,458 --> 01:07:16,166
Hello, Mr. Ghanshyam. How are you?

854
01:07:16,250 --> 01:07:18,833
Good. I was the one who approached you.

855
01:07:18,916 --> 01:07:19,833
Yes, yes.

856
01:07:19,916 --> 01:07:21,083
- Please sit.
- Yes.

857
01:07:23,250 --> 01:07:27,458
<i>Bhai Sahab,</i> this is Mr. B.K. Arora
from IndiaFirst Life Insurance.

858
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,000
Yes.

859
01:07:30,041 --> 01:07:32,833
I just needed to get
some papers signed by Mrs. Sandhya.

860
01:07:33,416 --> 01:07:34,250
Why?

861
01:07:34,333 --> 01:07:38,000
Astik Giri took a life insurance from us.

862
01:07:38,083 --> 01:07:40,250
He chose the five million rupee policy.

863
01:07:40,875 --> 01:07:43,583
And made his wife Sandhya the beneficiary.

864
01:07:43,666 --> 01:07:47,958
So we need her to sign some papers
and collect the check.

865
01:07:48,708 --> 01:07:50,625
Who else is a beneficiary?

866
01:07:50,708 --> 01:07:52,625
His parents, surely.

867
01:07:53,375 --> 01:07:54,375
No.

868
01:07:56,416 --> 01:07:59,625
It's a single beneficiary.
Only his wife, Sandhya Giri.

869
01:08:02,416 --> 01:08:05,875
- Sandhya... I'll get Sandhya.
- Yes, thank you.

870
01:08:11,250 --> 01:08:14,791
Come on, hurry. Come.
Someone important is here to meet you.

871
01:08:14,875 --> 01:08:16,750
Mother, what are you doing?

872
01:08:16,833 --> 01:08:19,708
He is waiting with everyone downstairs.
The scarf! Let's go quickly.

873
01:08:19,791 --> 01:08:21,166
Nazia! Mom!

874
01:08:27,416 --> 01:08:28,250
Hello, Mrs. Sandhya.

875
01:08:28,333 --> 01:08:30,666
I am really sorry for your loss.

876
01:08:30,750 --> 01:08:32,833
Our company extends their support to you.

877
01:08:33,916 --> 01:08:35,291
- Please, sit.
- Yes.

878
01:08:39,541 --> 01:08:40,583
Move over.

879
01:08:44,750 --> 01:08:45,750
Sit.

880
01:08:49,583 --> 01:08:52,708
Your husband bought a policy
in your name worth five million rupees.

881
01:08:54,125 --> 01:08:55,333
I've done what was needed...

882
01:08:55,458 --> 01:08:58,375
...and I have the forms with me.

883
01:09:01,291 --> 01:09:02,333
Yes.

884
01:09:03,041 --> 01:09:08,041
I need you to just check and sign them.

885
01:09:08,125 --> 01:09:10,041
Here you go.

886
01:09:10,125 --> 01:09:12,583
Move the table closer please.

887
01:09:13,291 --> 01:09:15,166
Nazia, take the glass of water away.

888
01:09:16,250 --> 01:09:17,458
Jhumri.

889
01:09:19,375 --> 01:09:20,208
Yes?

890
01:09:20,291 --> 01:09:21,791
- Take the water away, please.
- Okay.

891
01:09:22,833 --> 01:09:25,000
Pen. Do you have pen?

892
01:09:25,083 --> 01:09:27,625
- Does anyone have a pen?
- Giri <i>ji,</i> give your daughter a pen.

893
01:09:27,708 --> 01:09:30,458
Pen? It's somewhere inside.

894
01:09:32,083 --> 01:09:33,958
Pen... Bring one.

895
01:09:34,041 --> 01:09:35,333
I have a pen.

896
01:09:52,083 --> 01:09:54,333
Sign right here, please.

897
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:08,000
What?

898
01:10:08,541 --> 01:10:12,291
Ghanshyam, we trusted you as our own.

899
01:10:12,375 --> 01:10:14,000
How am I at fault here?

900
01:10:14,583 --> 01:10:16,958
Astik chose Sandhya
as his beneficiary, not me.

901
01:10:17,041 --> 01:10:19,375
But you could have
informed us earlier at least.

902
01:10:19,458 --> 01:10:21,041
What difference would that have made?

903
01:10:21,125 --> 01:10:25,375
Even if you knew earlier,
you couldn't have changed the beneficiary.

904
01:10:26,583 --> 01:10:27,708
And I assumed...

905
01:10:28,791 --> 01:10:32,208
Astik must have told you
that the beneficiary was Sandhya.

906
01:10:32,291 --> 01:10:33,541
He was your son, after all.

907
01:10:33,625 --> 01:10:35,208
Don't bother with him.

908
01:10:35,291 --> 01:10:37,500
He watches crime shows on TV all day,

909
01:10:37,583 --> 01:10:40,750
and yet isn't aware of the crimes
happening under his own roof.

910
01:10:40,833 --> 01:10:42,958
This is no crime, <i>Bhai Sahab.</i>

911
01:10:45,541 --> 01:10:49,583
Sandhya was dependent on Astik,
so he made her the beneficiary. That's it.

912
01:10:50,208 --> 01:10:52,083
"Made her the beneficiary."

913
01:10:52,166 --> 01:10:54,916
What about you?
Weren't you dependent on him too?

914
01:10:56,041 --> 01:11:01,000
Astik was making good money,
which is why he made you retire.

915
01:11:01,916 --> 01:11:05,750
And he used your retirement fund to pay
the first loan installment of a new home.

916
01:11:06,333 --> 01:11:08,625
Now, how will you pay
the rest of the installments?

917
01:11:08,708 --> 01:11:09,916
You don't worry about me.

918
01:11:11,250 --> 01:11:13,791
By the grace of God,
I still have this ancestral house.

919
01:11:14,416 --> 01:11:15,875
Really? This ancestral house?

920
01:11:15,958 --> 01:11:18,375
That's forever been stuck
under dispute in court.

921
01:11:19,541 --> 01:11:22,125
Let it be, Tarun,
you're talking to a brick wall here.

922
01:11:22,208 --> 01:11:24,291
He still thinks he's like Adani or Ambani.

923
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,333
No. I know I'm no Adani or Ambani.

924
01:11:31,541 --> 01:11:34,041
While Astik was alive,
I had strength and support.

925
01:11:35,583 --> 01:11:37,208
Now that he's gone...

926
01:11:38,291 --> 01:11:41,083
nothing can be done.

927
01:11:41,166 --> 01:11:42,500
That's not true.

928
01:11:43,458 --> 01:11:44,458
This is India.

929
01:11:44,958 --> 01:11:46,708
Miracles happen here every day.

930
01:11:47,708 --> 01:11:49,333
Let's try and convince Mr. Arora.

931
01:11:49,916 --> 01:11:51,916
Why? What will he do?

932
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:53,458
You stay out of this.

933
01:11:54,041 --> 01:11:56,791
Shibu, there's a lot
that is still in Arora's control.

934
01:11:56,875 --> 01:11:58,333
Let's go meet him. Come on.

935
01:11:59,291 --> 01:12:02,291
You're all here? What's going on?

936
01:12:03,083 --> 01:12:04,791
Nothing, Mr. Pandey.

937
01:12:04,875 --> 01:12:07,625
I was just explaining
the rituals for the bake...

938
01:12:07,708 --> 01:12:11,125
No, I mean, the wake. Please join us.

939
01:12:15,958 --> 01:12:17,916
<i>- Bhabhi?</i>
- Yeah.

940
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,250
You know what just crossed my mind today?

941
01:12:20,333 --> 01:12:21,333
What?

942
01:12:22,916 --> 01:12:24,375
<i>Dolly Ki Doli.</i>

943
01:12:25,208 --> 01:12:26,500
What is that?

944
01:12:26,583 --> 01:12:30,625
<i>Dolly Ki Doli.</i>
It's a movie starring Sonam Kapoor.

945
01:12:31,416 --> 01:12:33,333
Where do I get to watch movies?

946
01:12:34,125 --> 01:12:35,791
What's so special about that movie?

947
01:12:36,333 --> 01:12:37,416
In that film, Sonam Kapoor,

948
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:39,958
on the very night
she's welcomed into the family,

949
01:12:40,041 --> 01:12:44,000
robs them of everything and runs away
even before consummating the marriage.

950
01:12:47,583 --> 01:12:49,666
Whether anyone else
knows of this movie or not,

951
01:12:49,750 --> 01:12:52,708
Sandhya's mom surely must have watched it.

952
01:12:59,875 --> 01:13:01,791
Don't hog all the peanuts. Pass me some.

953
01:13:03,666 --> 01:13:05,958
Do you want to get
any of your clothes ironed?

954
01:13:06,875 --> 01:13:09,166
No. Nazia did them this morning.

955
01:13:10,916 --> 01:13:13,833
- Where is she?
- She has gone out for dinner with Parchun.

956
01:13:16,166 --> 01:13:18,166
Your in-laws are very backward.

957
01:13:19,750 --> 01:13:22,583
Even her teacup
is segregated from the rest.

958
01:13:25,375 --> 01:13:28,583
Did you notice earlier today,
how everyone was staring at you

959
01:13:28,666 --> 01:13:31,041
while you were signing
the insurance papers?

960
01:13:31,125 --> 01:13:34,208
Mummy, you watch too many TV soaps.

961
01:13:39,833 --> 01:13:42,000
I don't think
you should stay here anymore.

962
01:13:43,125 --> 01:13:46,333
You're educated.
You can start your life again.

963
01:13:48,750 --> 01:13:50,708
Come home with us after the wake.

964
01:13:51,625 --> 01:13:53,416
We'll figure out what to do next.

965
01:14:07,416 --> 01:14:08,416
Sandhya.

966
01:14:09,250 --> 01:14:10,291
Some tea?

967
01:14:11,041 --> 01:14:12,041
Yes.

968
01:14:19,291 --> 01:14:21,083
Where are your parents?

969
01:14:21,166 --> 01:14:22,750
They live in Delhi.

970
01:14:23,583 --> 01:14:24,750
I live here alone.

971
01:14:26,291 --> 01:14:27,708
Alone.

972
01:14:34,833 --> 01:14:35,833
Sugar?

973
01:14:36,625 --> 01:14:38,000
Lots of it.

974
01:14:55,125 --> 01:14:56,541
You like this Ayurvedic tea, too?

975
01:14:56,625 --> 01:14:58,000
I hate it.

976
01:15:06,916 --> 01:15:08,250
I saw it here, so...

977
01:15:18,041 --> 01:15:19,750
It was Astik's favorite tea.

978
01:15:27,291 --> 01:15:28,333
Let's go up.

979
01:15:35,208 --> 01:15:36,666
Here's my bedroom.

980
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,750
And this is my favorite spot.

981
01:15:47,458 --> 01:15:49,166
I spend a lot of time here.

982
01:15:52,958 --> 01:15:54,041
Is it nice?

983
01:15:55,083 --> 01:15:56,166
It's very nice.

984
01:15:57,791 --> 01:15:59,208
It's all very nice.

985
01:15:59,291 --> 01:16:00,416
This view.

986
01:16:01,750 --> 01:16:03,041
Your house.

987
01:16:04,166 --> 01:16:05,416
Your bedroom.

988
01:16:08,041 --> 01:16:09,291
And this bed too.

989
01:16:11,541 --> 01:16:12,916
It's all great.

990
01:16:18,750 --> 01:16:20,291
Which side did Astik sleep on?

991
01:16:21,125 --> 01:16:23,750
- What?
- You would sleep together, right?

992
01:16:25,541 --> 01:16:28,625
- Sandhya, please.
- Tell me?

993
01:16:28,708 --> 01:16:30,041
Don't.

994
01:16:30,125 --> 01:16:32,958
Because of you,
Astik could never fall in love with me.

995
01:16:34,291 --> 01:16:35,958
What are you on about?

996
01:16:37,083 --> 01:16:38,833
I'm not an idiot, Akansha.

997
01:16:39,416 --> 01:16:43,541
I get it all. Even after our marriage,
Astik stayed away from me.

998
01:16:43,625 --> 01:16:46,083
We didn't have one real conversation.

999
01:16:46,166 --> 01:16:48,875
I never saw love for me in his eyes. Why?

1000
01:16:49,583 --> 01:16:51,500
Because you kept fulfilling his needs.

1001
01:16:51,583 --> 01:16:52,583
Stop.

1002
01:16:54,041 --> 01:16:55,458
Is that all you wanted to know?

1003
01:16:56,625 --> 01:16:58,166
He never cheated on you.

1004
01:17:02,333 --> 01:17:03,750
He wasn't like that.

1005
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:12,416
We did love each other.

1006
01:17:14,625 --> 01:17:16,208
We really did.

1007
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:20,500
And you'll never understand the feeling.

1008
01:17:22,416 --> 01:17:25,208
You're too narrow-minded, Sandhya.

1009
01:17:26,458 --> 01:17:27,875
I feel sorry for you.

1010
01:17:29,083 --> 01:17:32,958
I wish you could
have discovered the real Astik.

1011
01:17:47,541 --> 01:17:50,208
<i>Sometimes ages
Sometimes a moment</i>

1012
01:17:50,291 --> 01:17:53,125
<i>Sometimes difficult
Sometimes easy</i>

1013
01:17:54,083 --> 01:17:56,625
<i>Sometimes sulking
Sometimes lying</i>

1014
01:17:56,708 --> 01:17:59,250
<i>Sometimes complete
Sometimes broken</i>

1015
01:17:59,916 --> 01:18:02,583
<i>Sometimes a firefly
Sometimes a star</i>

1016
01:18:02,666 --> 01:18:05,125
<i>Sometimes less
Sometimes more</i>

1017
01:18:07,875 --> 01:18:11,125
<i>Life speaks sweetly</i>

1018
01:18:13,166 --> 01:18:16,250
<i>But it tastes bitter</i>

1019
01:18:21,041 --> 01:18:23,666
<i>Slowly, slowly, little by little</i>

1020
01:18:23,750 --> 01:18:26,291
<i>All the hopes shattered bit by bit</i>

1021
01:18:26,375 --> 01:18:29,041
<i>We are all so naive, we fail to understand</i>

1022
01:18:29,125 --> 01:18:31,416
<i>The circus of this life</i>

1023
01:18:31,500 --> 01:18:34,416

<i>I'm the particle

1037
01:19:27,666 --> 01:19:30,375
<i>Will perform rebirth rites</i>

1038
01:19:30,458 --> 01:19:33,125
<i>Will burn our spirit</i>

1039
01:19:35,416 --> 01:19:39,000
<i>Flowers will bloom in the graveyard</i>

1040
01:19:40,916 --> 01:19:44,250

Today marks the tenth day of mourning.
Today Astik's soul becomes whole again.

1059
01:20:55,791 --> 01:20:56,916
On the thirteenth day,

1060
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:00,375
Astik's soul will embark
on a journey to heaven with his ancestors.

1061
01:21:00,458 --> 01:21:03,208
You can now immerse the holy offerings.

1062
01:21:07,166 --> 01:21:09,666
[chanting and praying]

1063
01:21:21,916 --> 01:21:25,625
Now, we tell Astik that for ten days,

1064
01:21:25,708 --> 01:21:29,083
"We arranged for food and water for you."

1065
01:21:30,166 --> 01:21:36,708
Now we pray to the almighty God
that He guide his soul to heaven.

1066
01:21:36,791 --> 01:21:40,291
Alok, kindly liberate your brother.

1067
01:21:56,041 --> 01:21:57,125
<i>Sandhya.</i>

1068
01:21:59,291 --> 01:22:00,333
<i>What happened?</i>

1069
01:22:04,125 --> 01:22:06,083
I have forgiven Astik.

1070
01:22:12,166 --> 01:22:13,750
Now I feel like crying.

1071
01:22:14,708 --> 01:22:17,083
But I'm also feeling very hungry.

1072
01:22:17,625 --> 01:22:20,083
What? Stop it!

1073
01:22:27,541 --> 01:22:28,541
Spices,

1074
01:22:29,166 --> 01:22:35,291
mattresses, quilts. 3,084...

1075
01:22:37,708 --> 01:22:38,583
Sugar.

1076
01:22:38,666 --> 01:22:39,708
- <i>Babaji.</i>
- What?

1077
01:22:43,333 --> 01:22:45,458
Did I mess something up?

1078
01:22:46,125 --> 01:22:47,125
No, child.

1079
01:22:50,958 --> 01:22:55,083
I was... just doing some accounting.

1080
01:22:57,875 --> 01:23:00,125
Here. Let me help you.

1081
01:23:00,708 --> 01:23:02,916
I'll read out the numbers.
You can calculate.

1082
01:23:07,708 --> 01:23:09,208
Is this all for the wake?

1083
01:23:20,083 --> 01:23:23,708
Twenty kilos of rice... 1,160.

1084
01:23:25,375 --> 01:23:28,958
Fifteen kilos of clarified butter... 6,960.

1085
01:23:29,833 --> 01:23:33,958
Twelve kilos of lentils... 1,200.

1086
01:23:36,291 --> 01:23:39,875
Nawabi tent house... 6,080.

1087
01:23:40,625 --> 01:23:42,833
No, actually, 6,088.

1088
01:23:51,041 --> 01:23:52,458
There's a lot of money being spent.

1089
01:24:00,875 --> 01:24:02,041
You can go.

1090
01:24:07,958 --> 01:24:09,458
I'll manage the rest.

1091
01:24:41,125 --> 01:24:44,416
So, Mr. Arora. What do you think?

1092
01:24:47,125 --> 01:24:49,458
I have nothing to think about.
You need to understand.

1093
01:24:50,125 --> 01:24:53,000
Nothing can be done.
I've told you repeatedly.

1094
01:24:59,916 --> 01:25:01,583
We believe it's all in your hands.

1095
01:25:01,666 --> 01:25:05,125
If we need to gift you something,
I'm sure my brother can take care of it.

1096
01:25:10,333 --> 01:25:16,500
So, Mr. Shivendra Giri, you've come here
to betray your son's widow by bribing me?

1097
01:25:32,083 --> 01:25:34,291
We wanted to talk to you about something.

1098
01:25:34,375 --> 01:25:35,833
Yes, what is it?

1099
01:25:38,333 --> 01:25:40,416
Nazia, could you give us a moment?

1100
01:25:41,833 --> 01:25:42,833
Sure.

1101
01:25:56,333 --> 01:25:57,333
<i>Bhai Sahab...</i>

1102
01:25:57,875 --> 01:26:03,291
Listen. Wait.

1103
01:26:06,375 --> 01:26:09,333
<i>Bhai Sahab</i>, please, don't be so...

1104
01:26:09,416 --> 01:26:13,000
Don't you dare speak to me.
What you did was very wrong.

1105
01:26:13,083 --> 01:26:15,625
I didn't do anything wrong.
Isn't this what we came for?

1106
01:26:18,375 --> 01:26:21,041
Seriously? Why is he getting angry at me?

1107
01:26:21,125 --> 01:26:22,791
Make sure to remind Uncle.

1108
01:26:23,375 --> 01:26:26,708
Yes. Okay, I need to go.

1109
01:26:38,041 --> 01:26:40,250
I should not have listened to them.

1110
01:26:41,416 --> 01:26:43,125
I feel so humiliated.

1111
01:26:44,541 --> 01:26:45,791
Let it go.

1112
01:26:47,708 --> 01:26:49,500
But why let it go?

1113
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:53,208
Tarun...

1114
01:26:55,041 --> 01:26:57,083
wanted me to bribe the agent.

1115
01:26:58,125 --> 01:27:01,041
If anyone finds out about it,
I would die of shame.

1116
01:27:01,125 --> 01:27:03,958
- No one will find out.
- What do you mean they won't find out?

1117
01:27:04,041 --> 01:27:07,916
Now it's done. Just let it go. Calm down.

1118
01:27:08,708 --> 01:27:12,291
You've stopped chanting these days.
That's why you're losing your temper.

1119
01:27:13,791 --> 01:27:16,000
Astik is gone...

1120
01:27:19,958 --> 01:27:22,916
leaving us to handle all this chaos.

1121
01:27:25,291 --> 01:27:29,333
It'll all be fine. Trust me.

1122
01:27:31,583 --> 01:27:33,375
I have spoken to Sandhya.

1123
01:27:35,125 --> 01:27:37,041
Rashmi had approached me.

1124
01:27:44,750 --> 01:27:51,083
Listen to me calmly.
She was saying that Aditya likes Sandhya.

1125
01:27:51,166 --> 01:27:54,458
So if we're okay with it, and...

1126
01:27:56,416 --> 01:27:57,416
And?

1127
01:27:57,500 --> 01:27:59,208
And if Sandhya wishes to...

1128
01:28:00,541 --> 01:28:02,833
Aditya is willing to marry her.

1129
01:28:02,916 --> 01:28:03,916
So...

1130
01:28:06,458 --> 01:28:10,625
You... went straight to Sandhya?

1131
01:28:11,416 --> 01:28:13,833
Yes, I'm worried for her future.

1132
01:28:27,458 --> 01:28:28,583
And how much...

1133
01:28:30,583 --> 01:28:33,625
did you ask for out of the five million?

1134
01:28:35,416 --> 01:28:38,375
Is this the path
your <i>guru ji </i>advised to pay off our loans?

1135
01:28:43,458 --> 01:28:44,875
By colluding with Rashmi.

1136
01:28:49,833 --> 01:28:53,041
You also went to the insurance office
out of desperation, right?

1137
01:28:57,916 --> 01:28:59,416
But it's okay.

1138
01:29:01,333 --> 01:29:04,458
If you can find
another way, then do tell me.

1139
01:29:07,875 --> 01:29:09,416
But until then...

1140
01:29:11,125 --> 01:29:13,458
she is just meeting Aditya.

1141
01:29:13,541 --> 01:29:15,583
However, ultimately it's her choice.

1142
01:29:36,500 --> 01:29:39,208
Grandma, time for your exercise.

1143
01:29:50,041 --> 01:29:51,125
The right one.

1144
01:29:57,291 --> 01:29:59,333
Mom says...

1145
01:30:00,125 --> 01:30:01,166
One moment.

1146
01:30:01,833 --> 01:30:06,333
You intend to marry me.

1147
01:30:06,416 --> 01:30:09,083
Your cousin's widow?

1148
01:30:12,083 --> 01:30:15,250
Yes. She's right.

1149
01:30:17,083 --> 01:30:18,291
But why?

1150
01:30:19,208 --> 01:30:21,375
Because I like you.

1151
01:30:29,333 --> 01:30:30,708
Grandma!

1152
01:30:40,416 --> 01:30:43,625
Look. You don't have prior experience.

1153
01:30:44,500 --> 01:30:45,750
So let me tell you.

1154
01:30:46,625 --> 01:30:48,416
Getting married without love

1155
01:30:48,500 --> 01:30:50,166
feels like eating dessert...

1156
01:30:51,875 --> 01:30:53,291
before the meal is served.

1157
01:30:54,666 --> 01:30:57,625
You're in the food business.
You must know this feeling, right?

1158
01:30:58,291 --> 01:30:59,291
Yes, but...

1159
01:31:00,625 --> 01:31:02,333
I have fallen in love with you.

1160
01:31:11,458 --> 01:31:12,458
So...

1161
01:31:14,666 --> 01:31:15,833
will you marry me?

1162
01:31:20,666 --> 01:31:22,875
What are you
looking there for, <i>Bhai Sahab?</i>

1163
01:31:22,958 --> 01:31:26,166
Parchun and Alok
hide here sometimes to sneak a smoke.

1164
01:31:29,916 --> 01:31:33,583
I've gotten
the expensive bottle out for you.

1165
01:31:35,333 --> 01:31:37,583
Check your drink. Is the ratio correct?

1166
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:42,416
It's perfect.

1167
01:31:44,416 --> 01:31:47,666
We're in the middle of mourning
or else I would have congratulated you.

1168
01:31:49,083 --> 01:31:51,416
Congratulate me for what?

1169
01:31:51,500 --> 01:31:55,666
We just want what's best for Sandhya.
That's all.

1170
01:31:55,750 --> 01:31:58,666
Of course. Fortunately, what's best
for Sandhya is even better for you.

1171
01:32:03,208 --> 01:32:04,791
Aditya wants to start a restaurant?

1172
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:07,500
Yes, that's what he hopes to do.

1173
01:32:07,583 --> 01:32:09,208
Now he wouldn't even need a loan.

1174
01:32:17,666 --> 01:32:20,125
I hope you and Shivendra
are on the same page.

1175
01:32:20,208 --> 01:32:21,541
Don't fight over this later.

1176
01:32:22,125 --> 01:32:25,250
Shivendra <i>Bhai Sahab</i> is not easy
to have an understanding with,

1177
01:32:25,875 --> 01:32:30,083
but... Rashmi and Usha have discussed it.

1178
01:32:32,708 --> 01:32:35,625
Anyway, it's only right that
the money stays within the family.

1179
01:32:36,250 --> 01:32:40,333
- And Sandhya has agreed to it, right?
- Yes. They've spoken to each other.

1180
01:32:46,583 --> 01:32:48,916
Now it's okay.

1181
01:32:52,666 --> 01:32:54,166
Have you lost your mind?

1182
01:32:57,333 --> 01:32:59,333
You agreed to marry Aditya?

1183
01:33:01,083 --> 01:33:02,916
- What?
- You're in quite a rush?

1184
01:33:07,708 --> 01:33:10,250
- Who told you?
- Everyone knows.

1185
01:33:12,541 --> 01:33:14,416
You could have at least asked me once.

1186
01:33:15,041 --> 01:33:17,583
He wants to marry me, Mom. Not you.

1187
01:33:17,666 --> 01:33:19,333
This is no time for mockery.

1188
01:33:20,458 --> 01:33:21,750
Don't be stupid.

1189
01:33:22,791 --> 01:33:25,916
He is not interested in you,
but your insurance money.

1190
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:28,708
To start up his restaurant.

1191
01:33:33,375 --> 01:33:35,541
You just never want
to see me happy, do you?

1192
01:33:40,041 --> 01:33:41,458
Am I so worthless?

1193
01:33:42,541 --> 01:33:44,375
Will someone only love me if I have money?

1194
01:33:49,083 --> 01:33:52,333
Fine. Do what you want.

1195
01:33:52,916 --> 01:33:54,541
Now that you're such a grown-up.

1196
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,166
I was just trying to look out for you.

1197
01:34:11,625 --> 01:34:14,625
- You're leaving tomorrow evening?
- If you want, I can leave right now.

1198
01:34:17,666 --> 01:34:22,458
Come along, Nazia,
I need help packing my bags.

1199
01:34:29,416 --> 01:34:31,000
Auntie, wait! I'm coming!

1200
01:34:42,666 --> 01:34:43,750
<i>Bhabhi.</i>

1201
01:34:45,958 --> 01:34:47,166
Yes, Alok.

1202
01:34:48,416 --> 01:34:50,333
Astik's laptop must be around here, right?

1203
01:34:51,375 --> 01:34:52,375
Yes, it's here.

1204
01:34:52,916 --> 01:34:55,791
It's probably of no use to you.
So can I take it?

1205
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:01,583
Yes, take it.

1206
01:35:06,208 --> 01:35:08,791
The charger is kept next to it.
Take that as well.

1207
01:35:12,916 --> 01:35:16,000
Are you going
tomorrow morning as well, for the rituals?

1208
01:35:16,083 --> 01:35:19,583
Tomorrow is the wake.
I hope you remember that?

1209
01:35:20,208 --> 01:35:22,291
Everyone else seems
to have forgotten about it.

1210
01:35:22,375 --> 01:35:24,583
They seem to be preparing
for a celebration instead.

1211
01:35:39,208 --> 01:35:42,083
<i>Bhabhi, </i>why are you marrying him?

1212
01:35:43,583 --> 01:35:46,250
<i>Bhabhi,</i> please tell me.
Why are you marrying him?

1213
01:35:48,666 --> 01:35:49,958
Because he loves me.

1214
01:35:51,458 --> 01:35:52,458
No.

1215
01:35:54,166 --> 01:35:56,041
You know he does not truly love you.

1216
01:35:57,541 --> 01:36:02,458
And... you also know
who really does love you.

1217
01:36:08,875 --> 01:36:12,416
Alok... I'm your sister-in-law.

1218
01:36:17,500 --> 01:36:18,666
Alok...

1219
01:37:01,416 --> 01:37:04,208
What happened, Sandhya <i>ji?</i>

1220
01:37:05,625 --> 01:37:07,666
I need to discuss something with you.

1221
01:37:09,083 --> 01:37:10,625
Yes, I'm listening.

1222
01:37:11,625 --> 01:37:12,875
I think...

1223
01:37:14,250 --> 01:37:19,750
we should get to know each other
very well before we get married.

1224
01:37:25,208 --> 01:37:27,708
Unless we get to know each other...

1225
01:37:31,166 --> 01:37:34,166
how can we fall in love?

1226
01:37:36,666 --> 01:37:40,250
Like, I don't even know
what your favorite color is.

1227
01:37:42,125 --> 01:37:45,375
My favorite color is black. What's yours?

1228
01:37:48,083 --> 01:37:49,083
Blue.

1229
01:37:50,875 --> 01:37:53,250
[chanting and praying]

1230
01:38:36,291 --> 01:38:37,291
Put it in the fire.

1231
01:38:41,875 --> 01:38:43,333
Go ahead, Nazia.

1232
01:38:43,416 --> 01:38:46,083
We are quite open-minded
about such things.

1233
01:39:34,666 --> 01:39:37,708
The rituals are complete now.
Please offer your last offerings.

1234
01:41:30,666 --> 01:41:31,666
Grandma.

1235
01:41:34,666 --> 01:41:35,666
Grandma.

1236
01:41:37,916 --> 01:41:39,916
You know what I am about to do, don't you?

1237
01:41:41,833 --> 01:41:42,833
Fine, then. Listen.

1238
01:41:43,375 --> 01:41:45,833
You might be
the first to meet Astik in heaven.

1239
01:41:48,083 --> 01:41:50,833
Please explain this to him, all right?

1240
01:41:53,166 --> 01:41:55,125
<i>I was just waiting until the wake.</i>

1241
01:41:55,875 --> 01:41:58,625
<i>And, Grandma, these 13 days
have turned my life upside down.</i>

1242
01:42:01,250 --> 01:42:03,000
Everybody thought I had gone crazy.

1243
01:42:05,333 --> 01:42:06,583
But you know what?

1244
01:42:08,291 --> 01:42:10,500
When women become wise,

1245
01:42:11,416 --> 01:42:13,041
the world calls them mad.

1246
01:42:19,750 --> 01:42:22,791
<i>Grandma, I have understood
the one thing that matters most.</i>

1247
01:42:23,375 --> 01:42:25,416
<i>If I don't take charge of my life...</i>

1248
01:42:26,500 --> 01:42:28,166
others will always make decisions for me.

1249
01:42:29,541 --> 01:42:31,750
Whether I like it or not.

1250
01:42:34,500 --> 01:42:36,791
So something needs to change, Grandma.

1251
01:42:45,375 --> 01:42:47,000
Son. What's wrong?

1252
01:42:54,708 --> 01:42:56,500
Now... Where are you off to?

1253
01:42:57,625 --> 01:43:00,916
- I am leaving.
- What do you mean "leaving"?

1254
01:43:17,208 --> 01:43:19,583
What happened?
Why did Aditya leave like that?

1255
01:43:19,666 --> 01:43:22,750
- He has refused to get married to Sandhya.
- Why?

1256
01:43:25,750 --> 01:43:26,916
Sandhya is pregnant.

1257
01:43:28,791 --> 01:43:30,375
She is carrying Astik's child.

1258
01:43:33,125 --> 01:43:36,166
- Who said so?
- Sandhya herself told Aditya.

1259
01:43:36,916 --> 01:43:38,458
Sandhya never said anything to me.

1260
01:43:38,541 --> 01:43:40,833
She has been visiting the doctor.

1261
01:43:42,875 --> 01:43:44,416
We should have cared enough to know.

1262
01:43:46,125 --> 01:43:49,416
With the mourning period going on,
how could she tell us?

1263
01:43:50,208 --> 01:43:51,875
Give your blessings, Grandma.

1264
01:43:53,750 --> 01:43:55,250
I'll need it.

1265
01:44:03,083 --> 01:44:04,625
Take care of yourself, Grandma.

1266
01:44:08,916 --> 01:44:12,166
Ma, it's not possible.
She can't be pregnant.

1267
01:44:12,250 --> 01:44:14,375
Aditi, don't interfere in adult matters.

1268
01:44:14,458 --> 01:44:17,250
Just a minute, Ma. I'm 100% sure about it.

1269
01:44:17,333 --> 01:44:18,333
How come?

1270
01:44:18,791 --> 01:44:21,583
I'm on my period.
And yesterday, I ran out of sanitary pads.

1271
01:44:21,666 --> 01:44:23,250
So I asked Sandhya <i>Bhabhi,</i>

1272
01:44:23,333 --> 01:44:25,250
and she told me
she was on her period too.

1273
01:44:26,125 --> 01:44:29,291
She had one packet left,
but she still gave me two pads from it.

1274
01:44:29,375 --> 01:44:31,255
- You come with me outside.
- Just listen to me.

1275
01:44:31,333 --> 01:44:32,375
Aditi.

1276
01:44:33,166 --> 01:44:34,958
Dad, I'm sure you understand.

1277
01:44:35,041 --> 01:44:39,208
If Sandhya <i>Bhabhi</i> was on her period,
how could she be pregnant?

1278
01:44:40,041 --> 01:44:42,250
This is the result
of letting her watch <i>Pad Man.</i>

1279
01:44:42,333 --> 01:44:45,291
Everyone thinks they're Superman now.
Cinema has ruined this generation.

1280
01:44:49,166 --> 01:44:51,708
Let me go speak to Sandhya.

1281
01:44:56,083 --> 01:44:59,250
Nazia? Sandhya?

1282
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:02,000
What happened?

1283
01:45:03,041 --> 01:45:04,750
Sandhya isn't in her room.

1284
01:45:04,833 --> 01:45:08,333
What is there to worry about it?
She must be downstairs. Let's check.

1285
01:45:12,708 --> 01:45:13,708
What is it?

1286
01:45:13,750 --> 01:45:15,916
It's a letter from Sandhya.

1287
01:45:17,625 --> 01:45:18,791
Addressed to you.

1288
01:45:21,875 --> 01:45:25,208
<i>Mother, your sorcery worked.</i>

1289
01:45:25,291 --> 01:45:28,541
<i>The evil eye has vanished. I'm leaving.</i>

1290
01:45:29,833 --> 01:45:32,416
<i>And I am not pregnant.</i>

1291
01:45:33,083 --> 01:45:37,500
<i>You should've seen
Aditya's face when I told him I was.</i>

1292
01:45:38,791 --> 01:45:40,250
<i>He didn't love me.</i>

1293
01:45:40,958 --> 01:45:44,416
<i>I only lied to expose his lie.</i>

1294
01:45:46,250 --> 01:45:49,541
<i>You'd told me, Mother, that I am educated.</i>

1295
01:45:49,625 --> 01:45:51,125
<i>I can be self-dependent.</i>

1296
01:45:52,250 --> 01:45:54,208
<i>I am going to do just that.</i>

1297
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:57,583
<i>Don't bother Dad.
I'll call you once I reach my destination.</i>

1298
01:46:04,625 --> 01:46:05,875
Usha.

1299
01:46:24,791 --> 01:46:28,666
<i>Mother-in-law,
I have a job interview tomorrow.</i>

1300
01:46:29,416 --> 01:46:34,125
<i>I'm leaving because the world is ready
to decide what's best for women,</i>

1301
01:46:34,791 --> 01:46:38,208
<i>but nobody stops for a second
to ask women.</i>

1302
01:46:39,875 --> 01:46:43,958
<i>Just like Astik has taken
a new form in these 13 days,</i>

1303
01:46:44,500 --> 01:46:48,916
<i>I have also found a new lease on life.</i>

1304
01:46:50,291 --> 01:46:55,625
<i>I know whatever you did,
you had my best interest at heart.</i>

1305
01:46:56,583 --> 01:46:57,833
<i>For that, I thank you.</i>

1306
01:46:57,916 --> 01:46:58,916
Parchun, listen.

1307
01:47:01,375 --> 01:47:02,958
Where is Sandhya? She's not at home.

1308
01:47:03,041 --> 01:47:06,625
- I think she left with Nazia.
- See if she went outside. Go check. Quick.

1309
01:47:06,708 --> 01:47:08,208
- Okay.
- Hurry up.

1310
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:11,416
<i>I have left behind
the insurance money for </i>Babaji.

1311
01:47:11,500 --> 01:47:13,083
<i>The cheque is under Grandma's pillow.</i>

1312
01:47:14,125 --> 01:47:17,791
<i>He doesn't say it,
but I know he needs it more than I do.</i>

1313
01:47:23,208 --> 01:47:24,208
Usha.

1314
01:47:35,333 --> 01:47:38,750
<i>And, </i>Amma,
<i>now I will earn a living as well.</i>

1315
01:47:39,458 --> 01:47:43,125
<i>Please let </i>Babaji<i> know
that he need not worry about anything.</i>

1316
01:47:44,375 --> 01:47:48,500
<i>I will take care of him,
just like Astik did.</i>

1317
01:47:50,708 --> 01:47:51,958
Sandhya.

1318
01:48:34,125 --> 01:48:35,750
I didn't think you'd come.

1319
01:48:37,791 --> 01:48:41,250
Sorry. I troubled you a lot.

1320
01:48:41,916 --> 01:48:44,541
No, you didn't. It's okay.

1321
01:48:46,416 --> 01:48:48,791
Today, I'm not
going to ask anything of you.

1322
01:48:50,375 --> 01:48:54,250
Instead I want
to return something that's yours.

1323
01:49:23,916 --> 01:49:27,166
- Any luck?
- We checked everywhere. No luck.

1324
01:49:31,208 --> 01:49:33,291
One minute, excuse me.

1325
01:49:33,833 --> 01:49:35,291
<i>Alok...</i>

1326
01:49:35,375 --> 01:49:38,375
<i>Sharma Auntie's daughter
must've sent you a friend request.</i>

1327
01:49:38,916 --> 01:49:40,333
<i>Accept it.</i>

1328
01:49:41,083 --> 01:49:43,166
<i>Make sure to type carefully on chat.</i>

1329
01:49:43,666 --> 01:49:45,500
<i>Your English is terrible.</i>

1330
01:49:46,500 --> 01:49:49,041
<i>You will now need a new teacher...</i>

1331
01:49:49,583 --> 01:49:51,125
<i>as I am leaving...</i>

1332
01:49:51,208 --> 01:49:52,458
<i>to look for a job.</i>

1333
01:49:53,458 --> 01:49:57,083
<i>And, yes, I am taking
the laptop and charger.</i>

1334
01:49:57,166 --> 01:49:59,083
<i>I will need them now.</i>

1335
01:50:13,708 --> 01:50:15,000
Where's my Pepsi?

1336
01:50:15,708 --> 01:50:17,875
I'm only kidding. Take care of yourself.

1337
01:50:17,958 --> 01:50:19,958
You too. Text me once you get there.

1338
01:50:20,041 --> 01:50:21,916
Yes, and I'll send you Parchun's number!

1339
01:50:35,833 --> 01:50:37,916
<i>Give your heart away</i>

1340
01:50:39,250 --> 01:50:41,375
<i>Fulfill your wishes</i>

1341
01:50:43,083 --> 01:50:45,125
<i>These beautiful landscapes around you</i>

1342
01:50:46,666 --> 01:50:49,041
<i>They are all calling you</i>

1343
01:50:52,916 --> 01:50:55,500
<i>What will you say to your lovers?</i>

1344
01:50:56,416 --> 01:50:59,208
<i>Let your wishes be fulfilled</i>

1345
01:51:00,333 --> 01:51:03,166
<i>I will tell the whole world</i>

1346
01:51:03,750 --> 01:51:06,583
<i>Listen to my stories</i>

1347
01:51:07,500 --> 01:51:10,583
<i>What will you say to your lovers?</i>

1348

<i>Let your wishes be fulfilled</i>

<i>I will tell the whole world</i>

1350

<i>And it calls me...</i>

1351
01:51:19,500 --> 01:51:21,208
<i>- And it calls me...
- Crazy</i>

1352
01:51:24,041 --> 01:51:25,250

<i>For many years</i>

<i>I've gathered my playfulness</i>

1358
01:51:55,541 --> 01:51:56,708
<i>My playfulness</i>

1359
01:51:58,083 --> 01:51:59,916
<i>Sometimes I fought with my heart
And did it</i>

1360
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,208
<i>Sometimes I did it for my heart</i>

1361
01:52:02,833 --> 01:52:04,375
<i>Yes, I did it</i>

1362
01:52:04,458 --> 01:52:06,291
