1
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:17,910
At the stroke of the midnight
hour when the world sleeps...

2
00:01:17,977 --> 00:01:22,243
...India will awaken to
the light of freedom.

3
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:56,347
People are our real strength.

4
00:01:56,683 --> 00:02:01,279
Our real strength is to
make this world strong.

5
00:02:01,554 --> 00:02:05,615
So, brothers and sisters..
Indians, unite.

6
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:10,020
Indians, be strong.
Indians, march ahead.

7
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:15,324
If we think like this
then nobody can stop us!

8
00:02:15,401 --> 00:02:17,426
Nobody can suppress us!

9
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:24,362
Two plates of mutton chops.

10
00:03:28,775 --> 00:03:30,037
Tea! Here!

11
00:03:30,777 --> 00:03:32,039
Tell me.

12
00:03:32,178 --> 00:03:34,043
What was the problem in
the football match?

13
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,777
Two teas on table three.

14
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:39,251
Chhotu, serve water here!

15
00:03:41,788 --> 00:03:43,050
What a solid head-butt!

16
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:45,052
What's his name?

17
00:03:45,124 --> 00:03:46,182
His!
- Yes.

18
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:50,787
His name.. is 'Jakos Lavakii
Vachipuchi Vakola.'

19
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:53,793
Why do you care about the name?

20
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,126
You don't even know
the difference between..

21
00:03:56,202 --> 00:03:57,260
.. Sharon Stone and kidney stone.

22
00:04:00,807 --> 00:04:02,741
That day I asked him
his father's name..

23
00:04:02,809 --> 00:04:04,470
..and he was blank for half an hour.

24
00:04:05,511 --> 00:04:07,069
He then came up with three names.

25
00:04:07,313 --> 00:04:08,803
And he's still unsure about it.

26
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,080
All the three fathers that
he named are still arguing.

27
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,549
One says he has my nose.

28
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:13,745
The other says he has my height.

29
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,481
And the third says his
colour matches mine.

30
00:04:17,223 --> 00:04:18,281
Suresh!
{Dead Rippers Society - FarooqBhai}

31
00:04:18,691 --> 00:04:20,318
Good that France lost.

32
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:23,092
After Zidane pleaded..

33
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:26,291
No, Suresh.
I was a bit sad.

34
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:29,165
It would have been nice if
Zidane had won the match.

35
00:04:29,235 --> 00:04:31,169
His wife would have been
happy and his children too.

36
00:04:31,838 --> 00:04:34,329
And brother would have
played football in bed too.

37
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:37,136
And head-butted his wife as well!

38
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,277
Do you know who the most
important person in France is?

39
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:44,111
The President.
- Yes.

40
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:50,448
Zidane had retired. President
especially called him and said..

41
00:04:50,523 --> 00:04:52,457
Hey, since when did Zidane
become your brother?

42
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:58,157
You've never ever
called me brother. - You too!

43
00:05:00,366 --> 00:05:02,129
Now that the team has
reached the finals..

44
00:05:02,201 --> 00:05:03,259
..he is showing his true colours.

45
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,531
No, Suresh. It's not that.

46
00:05:05,738 --> 00:05:06,796
Then what is it?

47
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,870
That player from Italy..
what's his name?

48
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:12,167
Materazzi.
- Materazzi.

49
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:17,142
He called brother Zidane..
Zidane a terrorist.

50
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:18,875
So what?

51
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:20,210
He is a Muslim,
so he said it.

52
00:05:20,286 --> 00:05:21,810
Uncle, how are you?
- Fine.

53
00:05:21,888 --> 00:05:24,550
He was playing from that team,
how can you talk about religion?

54
00:05:24,624 --> 00:05:25,682
Brother Musa,
greetings.

55
00:05:25,758 --> 00:05:27,885
Why? Doesn't France have Muslims?

56
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:29,586
Lower your voice!

57
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:31,888
Sit!

58
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:35,561
He harassed you,
didn't he? - Yes.

59
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,227
I will order tea.

60
00:05:38,571 --> 00:05:40,436
Brother Musa, two teas!

61
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:42,332
Are they the chief guests?

62
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,175
I say, the French team is hardly French.

63
00:05:46,245 --> 00:05:47,507
Listen to me.

64
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,480
Two or three are whites.

65
00:05:50,216 --> 00:05:51,615
The rest are all black imports.

66
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:54,711
Hey!
- Yes!

67
00:05:54,787 --> 00:05:55,913
They will select you for
the French team!

68
00:05:56,923 --> 00:05:58,185
Correct! Correct!

69
00:05:58,291 --> 00:05:59,349
He is right.

70
00:05:59,425 --> 00:06:01,916
They need someone for
that kind of a job.

71
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:03,253
Shut up.

72
00:06:04,797 --> 00:06:08,198
Listen! If I get angry,
I will thrash both of you!

73
00:06:08,267 --> 00:06:11,202
Why will you thrash just both of us?

74
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:14,940
And not thrash Suresh.
- Shut up.

75
00:06:15,808 --> 00:06:16,866
I'll trash you both!

76
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:18,467
Hey! That's enough!
It's mine. Put that down.

77
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:20,770
Why are you getting angry?

78
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:22,610
Look at them!
- They are just joking!

79
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:27,445
Anyway, what else
can we do with you?

80
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:32,282
Correct!

81
00:06:32,358 --> 00:06:33,655
Yusuf! Yusuf!

82
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:59,442
Suresh, you are the only one who can
treat us to cold drinks. - Yes!

83
00:06:59,986 --> 00:07:01,681
I haven't sold a computer in
the last 3 months.

84
00:07:02,688 --> 00:07:03,746
I'm flat broke.

85
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:08,985
I have a ten rupee note.

86
00:07:10,997 --> 00:07:12,259
I have to survive on it
for the entire day.

87
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,666
Do you understand?
Brother Ashok?

88
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:17,627
Okay, friend.

89
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:22,264
People say that some
Brahmins of the village..

90
00:07:22,341 --> 00:07:24,502
..are responsible for
this terrifying incident.

91
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:28,269
These are the three women
who lost their husbands..

92
00:07:28,347 --> 00:07:30,611
..and became widows that night.

93
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:32,279
Let's talk to them.

94
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,015
What are you feeling right now?

95
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:38,686
Do you know
who is behind all this?

96
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:43,626
These women are living in
the shadow of fear and terror.

97
00:07:43,696 --> 00:07:45,288
Even after losing their husbands..

98
00:07:45,364 --> 00:07:47,332
..they are not willing to say anything.

99
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:50,031
The police and government
are also mum about it.

100
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:55,633
Today in the 21st century,
we want to call India a super power.

101
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:57,966
Yet this village in India remains..

102
00:07:58,044 --> 00:08:02,037
..bogged down with caste
and religious barriers.

103
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:05,646
With cameraman Vasu,
this is Rupali Joshi for TV News.

104
00:08:05,718 --> 00:08:06,776
On TV News..

105
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:09,521
Wow, Rupali Joshi,
you are outstanding.

106
00:08:11,624 --> 00:08:12,682
Thank you.

107
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,620
Chief Minister wants an
immediate investigation..

108
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:17,686
Leave it on.

109
00:08:17,897 --> 00:08:20,559
Sorry, when the TV is on,
you don't talk to me.

110
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:21,826
You only watch TV.

111
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,065
You know why I watch TV?

112
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:29,331
To see your beautiful face again and again.

113
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:30,867
Really.

114
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:35,337
So especially for you,
I'm out of the TV..

115
00:08:35,414 --> 00:08:38,076
..and sitting right in front of you.

116
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:40,375
You can look at me all you want.

117
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,386
But I like seeing you on TV.

118
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:45,489
But my show is over.

119
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:46,953
They won't telecast it again and again.

120
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:52,361
Rupali, you looked
so nice on that show..

121
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:55,025
..you were looking so beautiful..

122
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:56,363
Really!

123
00:08:56,435 --> 00:09:01,498
Please don't mind, in reality
you don't look that good.

124
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:04,866
Really!
- Really.

125
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:06,603
Really!

126
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:09,439
Hey!
- Don't talk to me!

127
00:09:09,982 --> 00:09:11,381
Do you know how painful it is
to go to these remote places..

128
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:13,042
..and shoot with people?

129
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:18,118
I toiled hard for this report.
And all you saw was my face!

130
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:20,116
Great.

131
00:09:20,593 --> 00:09:24,393
Frankly, that was the only
good thing in the report.

132
00:09:24,797 --> 00:09:26,059
You mean the report was bad.

133
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:29,125
I mean it wasn't good.

134
00:09:32,638 --> 00:09:33,900
My bosses loved it you know!

135
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,071
According to them,
it is one of the..

136
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:37,666
..nicest news reports in recent times!

137
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,005
Do you know you don't even
get a bus to go there?

138
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,144
And I spent two days
with those people.

139
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:45,944
I am not denying it.

140
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,411
Everything else was fine,
but there is..

141
00:09:49,488 --> 00:09:52,150
..one thing I really
don't understand, Rupali.

142
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,424
The woman's entire family is dead,
her children are crying..

143
00:09:56,495 --> 00:09:58,429
..and you are asking her questions..

144
00:09:58,497 --> 00:10:01,091
..Like how do you feel?

145
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:04,835
How would it feel?
Of course, it will feel bad.

146
00:10:04,971 --> 00:10:06,097
It won't feel good.

147
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:11,107
Don't you think sometimes you make a
spectacle out of everything?

148
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:15,980
The truth that you want to hear.

149
00:10:16,882 --> 00:10:18,179
Why didn't you go to Bangalore?

150
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:24,046
The first news of the morning.
Only on Star News.

151
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:26,455
Come on, Patil sir.
We'll get late.

152
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:30,458
Wait, let me wear my shirt.

153
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,864
What if I went out like
this without my shirt?

154
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:38,060
Seeing my body,
girls will flirt with me.

155
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:42,532
And if they follow me home,
my wife will kick me out.

156
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:44,966
Wait, let me put on my shirt.

157
00:10:46,612 --> 00:10:48,477
Accused police constable
Sunil More was found guilty..

158
00:10:48,547 --> 00:10:50,014
..of raping a 16 year old student..
- Look at this!

159
00:10:50,516 --> 00:10:52,006
Due to Sunil More's incident..

160
00:10:52,084 --> 00:10:53,142
The entire department is defamed..

161
00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:55,210
..because of one such fool.

162
00:10:55,721 --> 00:10:59,020
I have never cast lustful
eyes on women.

163
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:01,159
But because of him, everyday
I have to bear the taunts..

164
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:03,161
..of any women I come across.

165
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:07,825
I don't even look at girls
these days while on duty.

166
00:11:08,701 --> 00:11:11,226
Sawant, once Bhoite
and I were on duty.

167
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,904
A college girl threw some
garbage on the road.

168
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,698
Bhoite set out to do social service.

169
00:11:15,775 --> 00:11:17,504
He told her, madam
the garbage bin is there..

170
00:11:17,576 --> 00:11:18,838
..throw the garbage in there.

171
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:22,237
She barked back, you do it!

172
00:11:22,715 --> 00:11:24,512
You don't do any other job.

173
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:26,517
The only work you do is to take bribes.

174
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:29,845
You people rape girls!
And you teach us!

175
00:11:29,922 --> 00:11:30,980
Shame on you!

176
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:35,687
Patel sir, really!
A big crowd gathered quickly.

177
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:38,730
And we had to flee
the scene apologizing to her.

178
00:11:38,798 --> 00:11:40,993
Otherwise.. - You would have
been in that garbage bin!

179
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:44,536
This man should be
handed over to the public.

180
00:11:44,603 --> 00:11:46,537
The women will thrash him good.

181
00:11:46,605 --> 00:11:48,072
No! He will die!

182
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:51,072
People like him should
die like this. -Why?

183
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:55,207
Just because he is a cop?
- Yes.

184
00:11:56,015 --> 00:11:57,209
But he's still human.

185
00:11:59,185 --> 00:12:02,677
I worked with him for three months
at the Meghwadi police station.

186
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:05,052
I never felt he could
do such a ghastly act.

187
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:12,729
Patil sir, it takes only two seconds
for the evil in us to take over.

188
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:16,831
And all sins are rooted in that time.

189
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,063
A doctor raping his patient.

190
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:23,733
A boss raping his secretary.

191
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:25,572
There is evil inside all of us.

192
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:32,682
Our department's duty is to
prevent such crimes, I agree.

193
00:12:33,018 --> 00:12:34,315
But what if one of us does it?

194
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:37,920
Others too do such acts!

195
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:40,826
Everyone does the opposite
of what they should be doing.

196
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:44,927
Everybody accepts bribes, cheats..

197
00:12:44,997 --> 00:12:46,259
..engages in wrongdoing.

198
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:47,731
But everything is done under the veil.

199
00:12:49,335 --> 00:12:52,600
Only our department's corruption
is open to scrutiny.

200
00:12:54,673 --> 00:12:59,610
Patil sir, everything is
so messed up that..

201
00:12:59,678 --> 00:13:01,839
..no one knows where it all began.

202
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:09,349
Will you go to Mahableshwar or sit and crib?

203
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:10,847
Come on!

204
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:13,049
Kadam, you are going to Mahableshwar?

205
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:14,621
Yes!
- Yes!

206
00:13:15,694 --> 00:13:18,162
Didn't you tell them?
- No!

207
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:22,032
There was no honeymoon
after his wedding.

208
00:13:22,701 --> 00:13:23,759
So he is compensating for it now.

209
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:30,075
Understood?
This means Mahableshwar!

210
00:13:32,878 --> 00:13:34,072
Mahableshwar!

211
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:46,182
Hey, if you drive any faster,
you will fly off. Idiot!

212
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:03,968
Yeah, baby! Yeah! No!

213
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:07,236
Okay!

214
00:14:09,715 --> 00:14:12,411
Right! I love you so much!

215
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:16,917
I love you, baby!
Talk to you later! Okay! Bye!

216
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:18,884
Give me a cigarette.
Quick. - Okay!

217
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:21,751
Here!

218
00:14:21,827 --> 00:14:22,885
Open the pack, man.

219
00:14:26,298 --> 00:14:29,426
A packet of biscuit!
- Thanks, buddy!

220
00:14:38,978 --> 00:14:41,208
Hey, what kind of a cigarette is this?

221
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,041
Don't you have the original brand?

222
00:14:43,115 --> 00:14:44,776
I do, but it costs 90 rupees.

223
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:47,444
Here, take this. Keep 100 rupees!

224
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,720
But who told you to give me this cheap
and duplicate contraband?

225
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:54,056
Will you decide which cigarette I smoke?

226
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:57,457
See? How money talks?

227
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:06,170
Hello! Listen, I am busy right now!
I will call you later! Okay!

228
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:07,466
Bye!
- Tea!

229
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:18,245
Listen, I told you! I am busy!
Don't you understand?

230
00:15:20,152 --> 00:15:21,210
What?

231
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:24,882
You know who I am, right?
And what I can do!

232
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:28,824
No! No, you listen to me first! Okay!

233
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:31,758
I don't like you talking
to me like that, okay!

234
00:15:32,965 --> 00:15:34,296
Now will you please shut the..

235
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:36,492
Hell, man!

236
00:16:16,241 --> 00:16:17,367
Here's the money.

237
00:16:17,443 --> 00:16:19,206
Madam, sweet bananas for sale!

238
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:21,473
Give me a plastic bag.
- Plastic bag?

239
00:16:22,414 --> 00:16:23,813
Hurry up.

240
00:16:23,882 --> 00:16:25,816
If I give you a bag,
I will be arrested.

241
00:16:25,884 --> 00:16:26,942
Nothing will happen.

242
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:28,077
Take it quickly.
- Thank you!

243
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:32,548
Sweet bananas for sale!

244
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:39,559
Do you know how harmful
the plastic bags are?

245
00:16:40,366 --> 00:16:43,426
What can I do, sir?
We have to do it for business.

246
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:45,963
It will take 10,000 years for..

247
00:16:46,038 --> 00:16:47,562
..this plastic bag to decompose.

248
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:52,841
That means, the plastic bag
from Lord Krishna's time..

249
00:16:52,911 --> 00:16:55,573
..would still exist today.

250
00:16:56,081 --> 00:16:57,844
Thankfully there were no plastic bags..

251
00:16:57,916 --> 00:16:58,974
..in Lord Krishna's time.

252
00:16:59,051 --> 00:17:00,916
Or the world would have
choked to death by now.

253
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:06,524
But sir, I've heard that there
were airplanes in those times.

254
00:17:06,592 --> 00:17:07,854
That's not the point.

255
00:17:07,926 --> 00:17:10,520
The plastic bags that you are
giving away are so harmful..

256
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:13,588
I am sorry I am late.
Got stuck in the traffic.

257
00:17:13,932 --> 00:17:14,990
Come on.
- Okay!

258
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:17,535
Don't use plastic bags,
understood? - Okay!

259
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:18,865
Hang on! Hang on!

260
00:17:18,937 --> 00:17:20,928
Is my plastic folder ok?
It's from my office. - It's not funny.

261
00:17:21,006 --> 00:17:22,337
Then what's the difference
between you and him?

262
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:23,870
Suresh.

263
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:32,247
What is this?
That's it?

264
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:34,415
Where's the ten
thousand you promised?

265
00:17:34,953 --> 00:17:36,887
Yes! That's all I have.

266
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:40,886
Now, you can't even meet
your interest payments?

267
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,552
Do you take me for a fool?

268
00:17:43,929 --> 00:17:45,624
You are educated,
aren't you?

269
00:17:46,198 --> 00:17:49,895
Get a job and at least think
of your old father.

270
00:17:50,969 --> 00:17:53,563
Bye! And listen!

271
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:58,634
You better come up with
the money in 4 days. Got it?

272
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:03,946
What happened in
the 26th July floods?

273
00:18:04,016 --> 00:18:06,075
Drains were clogged
because of all the plastic.

274
00:18:06,151 --> 00:18:07,448
Why are you getting so serious?

275
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:09,953
You think you can change
the world on your own?

276
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:12,422
Yes, if every person does their bit,
change is inevitable.

277
00:18:12,491 --> 00:18:13,549
Every person?

278
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:16,925
It's not about one person,
it's about the entire society.

279
00:18:16,995 --> 00:18:18,053
But who has so much time in Mumbai?

280
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:19,529
Hi, Nikhil!
How are you?

281
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:22,999
I am fine, how are you?
- Life's going on.

282
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:26,596
Good that I met you.
Do you have some time?

283
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,998
I am in a bit of a hurry. You..

284
00:18:30,075 --> 00:18:33,010
No problem,
we can talk on the train.

285
00:18:33,412 --> 00:18:35,277
It will only take 1 0 minutes.
- Okay.

286
00:18:35,514 --> 00:18:37,607
This is my friend Ashish.
- Hi.

287
00:18:37,683 --> 00:18:41,278
And he is.. - You don't remember?
No problem.

288
00:18:41,353 --> 00:18:43,947
Myself Bakul Patel.
- Bakul Patel. Sorry!

289
00:18:44,022 --> 00:18:45,080
How are you?

290
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:47,022
I have such a great business idea..

291
00:18:47,092 --> 00:18:49,617
..you won't need a job anymore.

292
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:51,958
The train has arrived.

293
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:53,088
Come on!

294
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:56,499
Sir, not in first class!

295
00:18:56,568 --> 00:18:58,035
I am a poor man,
let's go in the second class.

296
00:18:58,103 --> 00:19:00,503
No, no, not in the second class.
Never mind, we will talky later.

297
00:19:00,572 --> 00:19:03,541
It is a matter of 1 0 minutes,
sir. Ashish, come on.

298
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:07,568
Me? No! You go ahead.
I will leave! Bye! All the best!

299
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:14,981
How are you?

300
00:19:15,254 --> 00:19:18,223
Kadam sir.
You are going to your village.

301
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,515
Yes.
- Get something for me.

302
00:19:20,592 --> 00:19:22,389
Of course.
- Don't forget.

303
00:19:22,461 --> 00:19:24,656
Archana.
- Coming.

304
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,328
Give!

305
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,065
Who is it for?

306
00:19:36,742 --> 00:19:38,505
For you, who else?

307
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:43,443
Why me? I have an umbrella.

308
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:48,012
Umbrella!
- Yes!

309
00:19:48,754 --> 00:19:50,745
Have you ever been to Mahableshwar?
- No!

310
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,248
It is in the hills.

311
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:55,220
The umbrella will fly away
and so will you.

312
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:00,221
Wear it for me.
- No.

313
00:20:01,633 --> 00:20:04,761
I am asking you to wear it and
not to take it off. - Get off!

314
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:07,702
Wear it once!
- No!

315
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:10,773
Show it to me!
- Okay!

316
00:20:17,249 --> 00:20:19,774
You are a fool,
the camera is empty.

317
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,111
There is no film?

318
00:20:24,089 --> 00:20:25,147
No.

319
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:26,415
There is no film?

320
00:20:27,793 --> 00:20:29,055
Stop it.
- There is no film?

321
00:20:32,497 --> 00:20:34,522
I will click your photos!
- No! No!

322
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,090
There is no film?
- No! No!

323
00:20:39,471 --> 00:20:42,497
I have a great medical plan, Nikhil.

324
00:20:42,807 --> 00:20:46,766
Get your check-up done every year..

325
00:20:46,845 --> 00:20:49,814
..to see if you're in good health.

326
00:20:50,115 --> 00:20:51,776
Excuse me. Hello.

327
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,184
Hello. Where are you?

328
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:55,986
I will be there in half an hour.

329
00:20:56,288 --> 00:20:58,882
Okay fine, we are waiting for you.
Come quickly!

330
00:20:59,157 --> 00:21:01,990
Listen, say hello to him.

331
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,151
Yes.. Hello.

332
00:21:04,296 --> 00:21:07,993
Wait, talk to him.
Wait a second.

333
00:21:14,072 --> 00:21:15,130
Hello.

334
00:21:17,142 --> 00:21:19,906
Said hello?

335
00:21:20,812 --> 00:21:22,905
Hello! Hello, Nikhil! Hello!

336
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:25,211
Hello!
- Yes!

337
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:29,548
Listen! I'll call you once I get off.
It's very crowded.

338
00:21:29,954 --> 00:21:31,251
Fine.
- Take care!

339
00:21:31,423 --> 00:21:32,890
Okay! - Okay, bye.
- Okay, bye!

340
00:21:37,996 --> 00:21:42,865
We could have spoken later.
It's so congested here.

341
00:21:42,967 --> 00:21:46,562
So why don't you buy a nice car?

342
00:21:47,572 --> 00:21:48,834
Why? I travel in first
class very comfortably..

343
00:21:48,907 --> 00:21:50,306
..and reach in half an hour.

344
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:51,840
If I travel by car,
it will take an hour or so.

345
00:21:51,976 --> 00:21:53,841
You can appoint a driver too.

346
00:21:54,879 --> 00:21:56,847
Why, why would I do that?

347
00:21:57,015 --> 00:21:58,915
When the train is so convenient
why do I need a car?

348
00:21:59,217 --> 00:22:02,277
Most people buy a car
as a status symbol.

349
00:22:03,088 --> 00:22:06,353
People should use public
transport whenever possible.

350
00:22:07,459 --> 00:22:09,290
Or Mumbai will die one day.

351
00:22:10,028 --> 00:22:14,021
No, no, Mumbai won't die.
The people will.

352
00:24:31,669 --> 00:24:32,727
Look! Look!

353
00:25:38,469 --> 00:25:40,061
As you can see, the first class..

354
00:25:40,138 --> 00:25:41,730
..compartment has been torn apart..

355
00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:47,607
No help arrived for almost
an hour after the blast.

356
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:49,543
There was no police
and no ambulance.

357
00:25:49,647 --> 00:25:51,274
We helped all the people.

358
00:25:51,449 --> 00:25:53,076
We took the injured to the hospital.

359
00:25:53,184 --> 00:25:54,481
How many corpses and injured..

360
00:25:54,552 --> 00:25:55,814
..did you take out of the compartment?

361
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:58,145
We pulled out 15 to 20 dead bodies.

362
00:25:58,256 --> 00:25:59,814
And you took them
to the hospital? - Yes

363
00:26:01,092 --> 00:26:02,559
Your name, please.
- Sameer.

364
00:26:03,828 --> 00:26:07,093
As you can see,
we are at Matunga station..

365
00:26:07,165 --> 00:26:11,295
..where a powerful blast took
place about an hour ago.

366
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:13,670
The police have just arrived.

367
00:26:27,385 --> 00:26:28,511
Take him!

368
00:26:31,122 --> 00:26:32,214
No!

369
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:44,497
Nikhil always takes that train.

370
00:26:45,136 --> 00:26:48,537
By God's grace, he was late
and took the next one.

371
00:26:50,508 --> 00:26:52,305
No, we hardly travel.

372
00:26:53,478 --> 00:26:55,776
And Sejal does not need
to commute either.

373
00:26:57,148 --> 00:26:58,206
What?

374
00:27:01,152 --> 00:27:02,744
I don't know about grandson
or granddaughter.

375
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:04,549
But we will surely
become grandparents.

376
00:27:06,224 --> 00:27:08,784
Sejal? Sejal is watching TV!

377
00:27:23,841 --> 00:27:26,469
And Payal too has been born
in that hospital!

378
00:27:28,179 --> 00:27:31,615
Yes! She is an expert!
Diet is fine!

379
00:27:32,283 --> 00:27:34,274
She has given a big chart sheet!

380
00:27:46,197 --> 00:27:47,255
What happened?

381
00:27:50,201 --> 00:27:51,259
Nothing.

382
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:01,207
Nikhil, I don't want to argue again..

383
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:03,509
..but do you have to take the train?

384
00:28:05,883 --> 00:28:09,649
Sejal.. it is convenient.

385
00:28:09,754 --> 00:28:10,846
No, you listen to me!

386
00:28:11,355 --> 00:28:14,222
I was trying to reach you
from 6 in the evening to 7:30..

387
00:28:14,292 --> 00:28:16,351
But your phone was switched off.

388
00:28:16,761 --> 00:28:18,752
I was so worried.
- Why will I switch off my phone?

389
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:21,321
I am all alone.
I get tensed for you.

390
00:28:21,432 --> 00:28:22,490
But the networks were jammed.

391
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,397
You could have borrowed a phone.

392
00:28:24,569 --> 00:28:25,627
You could have just
called to say I am fine..

393
00:28:25,703 --> 00:28:26,761
..I am coming home.
All networks were jammed.

394
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:28,600
Sejal, what do you want?
I am home now. I am home.

395
00:28:28,673 --> 00:28:30,436
This is not what I meant.
- No! - Try to understand!

396
00:28:30,575 --> 00:28:34,568
I was waiting for you.
Wondering what happened to you.

397
00:28:34,645 --> 00:28:36,237
Wouldn't you get scared if you..

398
00:28:36,314 --> 00:28:37,781
..had been waiting for me alone?

399
00:28:37,849 --> 00:28:39,817
I was scared!
That's what I am saying!

400
00:28:40,585 --> 00:28:41,984
Listen. - You don't understand!
- I understand!

401
00:28:42,253 --> 00:28:43,743
So many times..
- I understand!

402
00:29:01,305 --> 00:29:02,363
What are you saying?

403
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,767
You will get it at the corner too!

404
00:29:04,876 --> 00:29:08,744
What is it? There were blasts in the city
and you want beer. Move it!

405
00:29:09,013 --> 00:29:11,311
Leave!
- Come on! - Leave!

406
00:29:11,415 --> 00:29:13,349
What do you have?
Take it out! Break it!

407
00:29:14,285 --> 00:29:15,343
Break it, I say!

408
00:29:17,622 --> 00:29:19,021
The bar is still open, isn't it! - Sir.

409
00:29:24,362 --> 00:29:26,489
Get up, come on, and get out!

410
00:29:26,664 --> 00:29:30,293
Come on, get lost. Shut that bar right now!
Come on, get moving!..

411
00:29:30,368 --> 00:29:34,327
Hello, sir. - What's so funny?
Shut it down!

412
00:29:34,906 --> 00:29:38,740
Get your hands off me!
Are you my friend?

413
00:29:38,843 --> 00:29:39,901
I said shut it down!

414
00:29:40,878 --> 00:29:42,345
Do I have to especially tell you?

415
00:29:42,446 --> 00:29:48,385
Patil sir! Your senior was just here
and he said not to worry.

416
00:29:48,686 --> 00:29:50,381
Kadam!
- Patil sir.

417
00:29:51,455 --> 00:29:52,888
Hold on! Hold on!

418
00:29:53,758 --> 00:29:55,623
Come on!
- Sit!

419
00:29:58,329 --> 00:30:00,422
Will you only stare at me?

420
00:30:00,665 --> 00:30:02,565
Have I ever been late for that?

421
00:30:03,367 --> 00:30:05,358
Kadam sir is not ready to listen to me!

422
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:06,728
Fool!

423
00:30:11,776 --> 00:30:14,643
Not me, give it to him.
He needs to calm down.

424
00:30:14,846 --> 00:30:15,904
Here.

425
00:30:22,887 --> 00:30:23,945
Listen.
- Yes.

426
00:30:25,022 --> 00:30:29,584
Get a nice gift for me.
I am retiring in seven days.

427
00:30:30,428 --> 00:30:32,396
Anything for you, sir. Just name it.

428
00:30:34,365 --> 00:30:40,099
How about this bar?
What say? Idiot!

429
00:30:51,382 --> 00:30:52,440
Come on!

430
00:30:54,886 --> 00:30:56,444
Patil sir, tell me something.

431
00:30:57,455 --> 00:31:00,390
My holiday gets cancelled
because of the blasts..

432
00:31:00,458 --> 00:31:02,619
..but the bars are left open.

433
00:31:03,427 --> 00:31:06,396
If you shut down the bars
too after the bomb blasts..

434
00:31:06,464 --> 00:31:08,898
..then what happens to
the spirit of Mumbai?

435
00:31:10,534 --> 00:31:13,833
I cancel my holidays and
come for work. What for?

436
00:31:15,606 --> 00:31:18,598
Not for nothing.
It's right there in your pocket.

437
00:31:20,645 --> 00:31:23,045
Shall we split it now? Give.

438
00:31:29,086 --> 00:31:30,144
Don't you want your share?

439
00:31:33,157 --> 00:31:36,558
Well, this is just the beginning for you.

440
00:31:36,727 --> 00:31:38,422
I'll retire in a week.

441
00:31:39,163 --> 00:31:43,429
And remember,
earn as much as you can..

442
00:31:43,501 --> 00:31:45,662
..but better save it.

443
00:31:46,771 --> 00:31:50,673
Once the badge is gone,
you lose all respect. Understood?

444
00:31:50,775 --> 00:31:51,833
Don't you think this is wrong?

445
00:31:54,512 --> 00:31:56,878
What's wrong with you today?

446
00:31:57,581 --> 00:31:58,639
So you think everything is right?

447
00:32:00,017 --> 00:32:03,180
Nothing is right or wrong.
- So what is it then?

448
00:32:04,989 --> 00:32:10,894
It's about what works.
To leave the bars open is wrong.

449
00:32:11,462 --> 00:32:14,056
So is letting them run
without protection money.

450
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:17,659
And you can't shut them down
after taking their money.

451
00:32:18,469 --> 00:32:19,527
That's very wrong.

452
00:32:19,971 --> 00:32:22,201
Understood? Let's go.

453
00:32:27,144 --> 00:32:30,910
Are you going to cry now?
It's not allowed.

454
00:32:32,216 --> 00:32:35,947
Crying in uniform is not allowed.

455
00:32:37,221 --> 00:32:40,019
When the tears start to flow,
leak them out.

456
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:42,651
All the tears will be flushed out.

457
00:32:44,228 --> 00:32:45,923
Come, let's take a leak.

458
00:32:46,097 --> 00:32:47,155
I don't want to.

459
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:50,558
Come on.

460
00:32:55,706 --> 00:33:00,609
I am your senior.
It's an order. Kadam, leak it out!

461
00:33:02,713 --> 00:33:05,546
Okay, Rupali! Let's get these
figures right before we telecast.

462
00:33:05,883 --> 00:33:06,941
Dead 150.

463
00:33:07,018 --> 00:33:08,076
And what else do our reporters..

464
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:09,210
..have to say who are on the site?

465
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:11,520
Okay, at the moment all
the figures that we have..

466
00:33:11,589 --> 00:33:13,523
..say that there have been
seven explosions as of now.

467
00:33:13,624 --> 00:33:14,682
These are the stations
that have been hit.

468
00:33:14,792 --> 00:33:17,260
The numbers of the dead
we have so far is 1 50 plus.

469
00:33:17,528 --> 00:33:19,894
That number, I expect, is going
to go up by at least 25.

470
00:33:20,898 --> 00:33:22,525
We don't know the exact time..

471
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,931
..of the blast at Mira-Bhayander.

472
00:33:24,268 --> 00:33:25,599
I've written 6.29. But..

473
00:33:25,736 --> 00:33:27,135
I am sorry. I have to go.

474
00:33:27,705 --> 00:33:29,605
I'm relieving Sanyogita
at Cooper Hospital.

475
00:33:29,707 --> 00:33:32,267
She's been there since seven.

476
00:33:32,543 --> 00:33:34,101
See, if you can find anything
interesting there. Okay.

477
00:33:34,211 --> 00:33:35,906
Yeah. Okay. Definitely. Bye.

478
00:33:36,013 --> 00:33:37,571
Now this is the body of
a 60 year-old man.

479
00:33:37,681 --> 00:33:38,739
He is a diamond merchant.

480
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:40,540
He was killed in the Jogeshwari..

481
00:33:40,618 --> 00:33:42,643
..explosion which happened at 6:25 pm.

482
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:45,184
He had diamonds worth
50 lakh rupees in his bag.

483
00:33:45,289 --> 00:33:46,950
I think this is really an
interesting story there.

484
00:33:47,558 --> 00:33:50,026
We should follow
the story of the diamonds.

485
00:33:50,561 --> 00:33:51,619
Nasir.
- Yes.

486
00:33:51,729 --> 00:33:53,924
We have to telecast this
day after tomorrow. Okay.

487
00:33:54,031 --> 00:33:56,556
Okay.
- That's Thursday. 7:30 p. m.

488
00:33:56,634 --> 00:33:58,226
Okay, Rupali, tell me
about that young boy.

489
00:33:59,303 --> 00:34:01,669
Okay. He's not actually a young boy.

490
00:34:01,772 --> 00:34:04,866
He's 27 years old.
Married with 2 kids.

491
00:34:05,309 --> 00:34:08,767
He has a large family but
he was the sole breadwinner.

492
00:34:09,647 --> 00:34:10,739
Now that's quite emotional.

493
00:34:11,649 --> 00:34:13,310
That will make a good
Saturday night story.

494
00:34:13,818 --> 00:34:15,308
That's exactly what I am thinking.

495
00:34:15,753 --> 00:34:17,778
Saturday! Prime time! 9:30!

496
00:34:17,888 --> 00:34:19,879
Let's first concentrate
on the fear factor!

497
00:34:19,990 --> 00:34:23,790
Okay! Just get hold of
2-3 nice interesting stories!

498
00:34:23,961 --> 00:34:25,588
Exactly! I mean
what happened today evening..

499
00:34:25,663 --> 00:34:28,097
..was so terrifying that..

500
00:34:28,165 --> 00:34:29,689
Hear me out, this is the structure.

501
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,597
I want to have a picture of the victim..

502
00:34:31,669 --> 00:34:34,331
..with that we will put name,
age, occupation etc, etc.

503
00:34:34,605 --> 00:34:38,598
And then all the family pictures,
home videos..

504
00:34:38,676 --> 00:34:40,143
..personal letters.

505
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:41,609
We should collect all of it.

506
00:34:43,114 --> 00:34:44,172
And also photographs!

507
00:35:18,816 --> 00:35:21,182
Move!

508
00:35:23,053 --> 00:35:24,111
Move aside! Please!

509
00:35:24,188 --> 00:35:25,655
Give way! Please!

510
00:35:44,041 --> 00:35:45,975
You check out there.
I will go and ask.

511
00:35:46,677 --> 00:35:47,769
Excuse me. Listen.

512
00:35:48,045 --> 00:35:49,910
Ajay Kumar..

513
00:35:50,014 --> 00:35:51,276
Don't worry, sister.
He will be fine.

514
00:35:58,856 --> 00:36:01,757
You check there. I will check here.
Okay. Don't worry.

515
00:36:37,962 --> 00:36:39,725
As per the hospital reports till now..

516
00:36:39,797 --> 00:36:42,459
..at least 70 injured people
have been admitted. - Hello.

517
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,461
Hello Rupali, Rensil here.

518
00:36:45,736 --> 00:36:47,397
Yes, Rensil.
- Any news yet?

519
00:36:48,939 --> 00:36:50,463
No, nothing.

520
00:36:52,009 --> 00:36:53,237
Did you check at the Bhabha hospital?

521
00:36:55,179 --> 00:36:56,237
We are just headed there.

522
00:36:57,181 --> 00:36:59,945
Listen, don't hesitate
to call me anytime.

523
00:37:00,017 --> 00:37:01,075
Okay! Anytime!

524
00:37:01,185 --> 00:37:03,312
My cell is on for 24 hours. Okay.

525
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:10,952
Rupali, could you do me a favor?
It'll only take two minutes.

526
00:37:11,428 --> 00:37:14,295
I know it's not the right time to ask.

527
00:37:14,832 --> 00:37:17,198
But.. could you give me
a bite on this?

528
00:37:21,805 --> 00:37:23,773
Hello. Rupali.

529
00:37:24,141 --> 00:37:27,770
Yes but.. right now?

530
00:37:28,145 --> 00:37:30,045
Listen, listen, Rupali.

531
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:31,408
Anandita is somewhere near you.

532
00:37:31,482 --> 00:37:33,950
And she was sort of
hesitating to speak to you.

533
00:37:34,151 --> 00:37:37,985
You know what I mean.
So please.. I mean..

534
00:37:38,856 --> 00:37:42,792
We have with us our very
own Rupali Joshi..

535
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:44,794
..who you saw on TV News..

536
00:37:44,862 --> 00:37:49,526
..right after the bomb blast,
reporting for us live.

537
00:37:50,267 --> 00:37:54,533
Rupali Joshi's fiancée, Ajay Kumar,
is missing after the blast.

538
00:37:55,472 --> 00:37:57,372
Rupali, how do you feel?

539
00:38:00,477 --> 00:38:02,536
Any news on him?

540
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:06,343
Not yet. We have checked here.

541
00:38:06,417 --> 00:38:07,941
And there is no news of him yet.

542
00:38:09,053 --> 00:38:10,987
We are going to other hospitals.

543
00:38:11,155 --> 00:38:12,417
We are on our way to
Bhabha right now.

544
00:38:12,823 --> 00:38:14,552
This is a Government hospital, Rupali.

545
00:38:14,825 --> 00:38:18,989
Is it equipped for such an emergency?

546
00:38:19,063 --> 00:38:21,258
Or people are facing any problem?

547
00:38:24,234 --> 00:38:26,031
Well, it's quite chaotic here.

548
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:31,064
But that's natural after such a tragedy.

549
00:38:32,209 --> 00:38:36,236
Rupali, a while ago when you
were at the blast site.

550
00:38:36,447 --> 00:38:39,439
The police was absent.

551
00:38:39,583 --> 00:38:42,575
And there was no
government official in sight.

552
00:38:42,853 --> 00:38:45,583
Would you like to comment?

553
00:38:48,525 --> 00:38:53,155
At present, the most important thing
is some news about Ajay.

554
00:38:54,398 --> 00:38:57,231
And we are trying our best.
That's it.

555
00:38:57,901 --> 00:39:00,199
I and the entire team of
TV News wish that Ajay is..

556
00:39:30,467 --> 00:39:33,129
I was watching TV at
home in the evening..

557
00:39:33,203 --> 00:39:34,261
..when my sister called.

558
00:39:35,405 --> 00:39:37,168
She said that there has been
a bomb blast at Khar station.

559
00:39:38,742 --> 00:39:41,176
She was fine and told me not
to step out of the house.

560
00:39:41,845 --> 00:39:43,335
I quickly switched to
the news channel.

561
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:47,616
-The entire train compartment
was torn apart.

562
00:39:48,585 --> 00:39:51,179
I couldn't watch it for more
than two minutes.

563
00:39:51,588 --> 00:39:53,419
Dead bodies, blood.

564
00:39:53,890 --> 00:39:55,414
My friend was on one of those trains.

565
00:39:56,259 --> 00:39:58,625
He says at least 300-400 people died.

566
00:39:59,562 --> 00:40:04,431
Body parts strewn across the railway track.

567
00:40:05,869 --> 00:40:10,533
A man was covered in blood.
From head to toe.

568
00:40:10,674 --> 00:40:15,611
Somebody was screaming out
his wife and children's names.

569
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:16,737
And wailing.

570
00:40:17,847 --> 00:40:19,178
Some people carried a dead body..

571
00:40:19,249 --> 00:40:21,240
..and all they got in hand was body parts.

572
00:40:21,785 --> 00:40:24,583
Who are these terrorists?
- Suresh!

573
00:40:24,721 --> 00:40:26,313
- Hey! Stop!

574
00:40:28,291 --> 00:40:30,452
What's in the bag?
- It's bread, sir.

575
00:40:33,196 --> 00:40:34,823
Bread or a bomb?
- Bomb?

576
00:40:37,867 --> 00:40:41,462
What are you laughing at?

577
00:40:41,604 --> 00:40:42,866
Do I look like a joker to you?

578
00:40:43,206 --> 00:40:44,264
Show me what's in the bag! Now!

579
00:40:47,744 --> 00:40:49,735
Sir, look. It is just some bread.

580
00:40:56,519 --> 00:40:59,249
Hope it doesn't explode in my stomach!

581
00:41:00,457 --> 00:41:01,583
Is he drunk?

582
00:41:04,728 --> 00:41:05,820
Who planned todays blast?

583
00:41:06,930 --> 00:41:08,261
I don't know, sir.

584
00:41:08,932 --> 00:41:10,365
No one from your clan involved?

585
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:13,425
Brother, nephew,
friend. - No, sir.

586
00:41:15,238 --> 00:41:16,296
Really!

587
00:41:17,741 --> 00:41:21,973
Tell me! Who planned today's blast?

588
00:41:22,245 --> 00:41:23,837
- I don't know, sir.

589
00:41:23,913 --> 00:41:27,280
Hey! What's going on here?
Tell me!

590
00:41:30,954 --> 00:41:36,984
Sir, look who it is.
- So? What happened?

591
00:41:39,929 --> 00:41:41,829
Nothing, I am just doing my civic duty.

592
00:41:42,665 --> 00:41:45,259
Really? Drunk in the middle of the night..

593
00:41:45,335 --> 00:41:48,634
..creating a ruckus.
Is that being civil?

594
00:41:52,308 --> 00:41:54,299
I was just checking his bag.

595
00:41:54,978 --> 00:41:58,675
Why are you getting into it?
We are still around.

596
00:42:00,383 --> 00:42:03,819
Of course, sir.
You people are there.

597
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:05,317
No denying that and yet
the blasts occurred.

598
00:42:05,955 --> 00:42:07,513
So many people died. Right?

599
00:42:07,824 --> 00:42:13,319
Hey, maybe I should
help you get sober.

600
00:42:13,463 --> 00:42:16,899
Now? It's late!
What's the use, sir?

601
00:42:17,333 --> 00:42:19,426
You couldn't do anything
when you should have done.

602
00:42:20,837 --> 00:42:22,771
Are you guys ever late for taking bribes?
What did you say?

603
00:42:25,041 --> 00:42:29,034
Trying to act smart!..
- Tell him! - Come on! Come on!

604
00:42:29,312 --> 00:42:32,941
Run! Run! Run from here..
Patil sir! Are you okay?

605
00:42:33,316 --> 00:42:36,843
Come on! Run! Run!
- Run! Run!

606
00:42:36,986 --> 00:42:41,787
Hey come on! - Run.. - Run..
- Stop! Go away from here.

607
00:42:47,430 --> 00:42:51,366
Patil sir! Patil sir! Are you okay?

608
00:42:55,038 --> 00:42:57,666
Hey you, get lost!
- Yes!

609
00:42:59,342 --> 00:43:00,673
Are you fine, sir?

610
00:43:12,088 --> 00:43:14,079
Yes, sir? Water!

611
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:19,751
Who were those guys?

612
00:43:20,096 --> 00:43:23,497
I have no idea, sir.
- Who were they?

613
00:43:24,033 --> 00:43:25,500
Well sir, I don't..
- Hey you!

614
00:43:26,069 --> 00:43:29,436
Are they regulars? Why are you
serving such idiots? - Sir..

615
00:43:29,572 --> 00:43:31,403
Hold your ears!
- What?

616
00:43:31,541 --> 00:43:33,509
Hold your ears! Do sit-ups!

617
00:43:34,777 --> 00:43:37,405
Hey Kadam, just forget it.

618
00:43:44,053 --> 00:43:46,419
I'll be back and
you better not stop this.

619
00:43:46,556 --> 00:43:49,650
Or else, I will send
you to Madras. - Sir!

620
00:44:00,937 --> 00:44:05,431
He is Ajay Kumar,
height 5'10" or 5'1 1."

621
00:44:05,608 --> 00:44:06,666
He is 28 years old.

622
00:44:08,811 --> 00:44:09,937
He is slim.

623
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:12,707
Has long, black hair.

624
00:44:13,750 --> 00:44:16,082
Has a mark on his abdomen.

625
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:18,453
Clean-shaven.

626
00:44:18,988 --> 00:44:21,422
He was wearing white full-2leeved shirt..

627
00:44:21,491 --> 00:44:23,152
..blue jeans and shoes.

628
00:44:24,027 --> 00:44:28,020
Blue shoes with white stripes..
no, sorry, beige stripes..

629
00:44:28,097 --> 00:44:29,621
Yes, beige!

630
00:46:21,544 --> 00:46:25,537
Investigations have so
far revealed that all 7 blasts..

631
00:46:25,615 --> 00:46:27,173
..were triggered by timer devices.

632
00:46:27,550 --> 00:46:30,542
Police officials say, most
of the bombs were planted..

633
00:46:30,620 --> 00:46:32,554
..at Churchgate station
of Mumbai between..

634
00:46:32,622 --> 00:46:33,714
..6:00 and 6:15 last evening.

635
00:46:33,790 --> 00:46:37,021
The police have confirmed that
RDX explosives were used.

636
00:46:37,226 --> 00:46:38,557
But the forensic experts are still..

637
00:46:38,628 --> 00:46:44,225
..investigating the nature of the bomb.

638
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:45,892
'Chhotu, clear the plates.'

639
00:46:45,968 --> 00:46:48,562
Meanwhile the Mumbai police is
getting sketches made..

640
00:46:48,638 --> 00:46:51,106
Tea.. - Based on eye-witness accounts.

641
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:52,298
Give tea at table number two.

642
00:46:52,575 --> 00:46:54,566
To try and ascertain the identity..

643
00:46:54,644 --> 00:46:58,102
..of those responsible for the blast.

644
00:46:58,181 --> 00:47:00,911
One plate double omelet,
minced mutton and minced eggs.

645
00:47:01,050 --> 00:47:03,211
The bomb blasts have raised
a question on security.

646
00:47:03,586 --> 00:47:04,712
The police would have to answer
a few difficult questions..

647
00:47:04,787 --> 00:47:06,084
- Mutton parcel in the days to come.

648
00:47:11,627 --> 00:47:15,791
What did you do the last night?
He was a police officer.

649
00:47:17,734 --> 00:47:19,258
The suburban trains of Mumbai..

650
00:47:19,335 --> 00:47:21,633
I'm scared even to step out of home.
- Where are these guys?

651
00:47:23,606 --> 00:47:28,669
Now we have to see that.. Who?

652
00:47:28,811 --> 00:47:30,676
Those regular useless benchwarmers.

653
00:47:32,949 --> 00:47:34,644
Who cares?

654
00:47:35,885 --> 00:47:38,649
No! They were here that day in the afternoon.
We too were there.

655
00:47:42,024 --> 00:47:43,150
That boy told them something..

656
00:47:43,226 --> 00:47:44,284
..and they left pretty quickly.

657
00:47:45,628 --> 00:47:46,686
So?

658
00:47:49,365 --> 00:47:55,235
Nothing. They haven't been seen
since the blasts that evening.

659
00:47:57,707 --> 00:48:00,267
Shut up! You have lost it, man!

660
00:48:01,210 --> 00:48:02,643
They look like regular guys coming..

661
00:48:02,712 --> 00:48:04,771
..for a cup of tea and a smoke.

662
00:48:05,047 --> 00:48:08,881
That's all. - So? You think
terrorists don't like tea?

663
00:48:10,820 --> 00:48:12,117
No, I mean..

664
00:48:12,188 --> 00:48:15,715
That chap, what's his name.. Yusuf.

665
00:48:16,325 --> 00:48:18,293
He can't possibly be a terrorist.

666
00:48:18,661 --> 00:48:22,825
Skinniest guy I ever saw.
Like one rib.

667
00:48:23,132 --> 00:48:24,360
How much do you think a bomb weighs?

668
00:48:27,703 --> 00:48:32,697
A small packet.
Place it right and boom!

669
00:48:33,342 --> 00:48:34,934
You don't need to be Mr. Universe.

670
00:48:36,679 --> 00:48:38,704
But they don't look like terrorists.

671
00:48:40,817 --> 00:48:44,218
You think they would wear
a T-shirt reading terrorist?

672
00:48:46,022 --> 00:48:47,216
Or a tattoo on their forehead?

673
00:48:48,391 --> 00:48:50,723
That chap, Yusuf.
He repairs air conditioners.

674
00:48:50,927 --> 00:48:54,090
No! Who repairs those anymore?

675
00:48:54,430 --> 00:48:57,092
Buying a new one is cheaper.. Shut up!

676
00:49:02,939 --> 00:49:05,169
Do you know where he works?
- Yes.

677
00:49:06,108 --> 00:49:07,837
Sure?
- Sure.

678
00:49:10,713 --> 00:49:11,771
Come on, let's check it out.

679
00:49:11,914 --> 00:49:13,711
Hey, wait! What are you up to, Suresh?

680
00:49:13,783 --> 00:49:15,114
This is a bit too much!
- Yes!

681
00:49:15,284 --> 00:49:17,718
We can go to the police if you want.

682
00:49:17,787 --> 00:49:19,755
What else can we do?
- Yes!

683
00:49:19,889 --> 00:49:23,757
Obviously! You didn't lose
a loved one in the blasts.

684
00:49:25,428 --> 00:49:28,761
You guys need a bomb under
your bum as a wake-up call.

685
00:49:28,965 --> 00:49:31,433
You will go straight to hell!
There too you guys won't do anything!

686
00:49:31,767 --> 00:49:33,029
You will remain as you are!

687
00:49:33,736 --> 00:49:34,794
Are you coming along?
- Yes!

688
00:49:34,871 --> 00:49:37,465
As I thought, the shop is closed.

689
00:49:37,974 --> 00:49:39,441
They must be across the border by now.

690
00:49:40,910 --> 00:49:42,810
I think Yusuf stays nearby.

691
00:49:43,079 --> 00:49:44,205
You think or do you actually know?

692
00:49:44,347 --> 00:49:47,805
Well.. - Follow me.
And you wait here.

693
00:49:53,789 --> 00:49:55,279
Suresh, let's go down there.

694
00:50:04,267 --> 00:50:06,497
Hey, put the ball here.

695
00:50:20,249 --> 00:50:21,409
Let's go, man!

696
00:50:28,024 --> 00:50:29,184
When will the doctor arrive?

697
00:50:29,325 --> 00:50:31,054
He is working on an emergency
case right now. - Okay.

698
00:50:31,127 --> 00:50:33,027
He will be here in 1 0 minutes.
- Okay.

699
00:50:33,162 --> 00:50:35,790
When should I take the medicine?
I have told her. You don't worry.

700
00:50:35,865 --> 00:50:36,991
I know.
- Yes.

701
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,058
Take care!
- Okay.

702
00:50:39,201 --> 00:50:40,259
Greetings.

703
00:50:43,806 --> 00:50:44,864
Listen!

704
00:50:45,408 --> 00:50:49,401
Ashish! How are you?

705
00:50:54,850 --> 00:50:56,010
This..

706
00:50:57,820 --> 00:50:59,344
This..
- Hey!

707
00:52:07,890 --> 00:52:08,948
In this filth.

708
00:52:11,627 --> 00:52:13,424
Manya.
- Yes. Ask him!

709
00:52:14,563 --> 00:52:16,497
Uncle, where does Yusuf stay?

710
00:52:16,632 --> 00:52:19,999
Which one?
Skinny or the fat one?

711
00:52:20,136 --> 00:52:21,194
The skinny Yusuf.

712
00:52:21,337 --> 00:52:23,931
There. See the green door.
- Yes.

713
00:52:24,006 --> 00:52:26,497
That's the one.
- Okay.

714
00:52:26,575 --> 00:52:31,274
"We are leaving.."

715
00:52:31,414 --> 00:52:33,041
Beautiful song!

716
00:52:33,115 --> 00:52:35,583
You know who's the singer?
- The great Mohammed Rafi!

717
00:52:36,318 --> 00:52:38,946
They will never hear
Kishore Kumar's song. Come on.

718
00:52:42,491 --> 00:52:43,924
Come on!
- Yes!

719
00:52:50,666 --> 00:52:52,463
Where is Yusuf?

720
00:52:53,102 --> 00:52:55,570
Yusuf is not at home.
Did you have some work?

721
00:52:55,938 --> 00:52:57,371
He hasn't been seen since the blasts..

722
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:59,271
Actually we haven't
seen him for a while.

723
00:53:00,609 --> 00:53:03,669
Are you Yusuf's friends?
- Come on in.

724
00:53:04,046 --> 00:53:05,513
No, thanks..

725
00:53:06,048 --> 00:53:07,242
Come! Sit!

726
00:53:10,553 --> 00:53:17,686
- You fool!

727
00:53:18,994 --> 00:53:21,485
Look there!
Yusuf was quite a cute kid.

728
00:53:23,299 --> 00:53:24,994
Yes, he was simply adorable.

729
00:53:25,367 --> 00:53:28,962
But these days he keeps
wandering around in the sun..

730
00:53:29,038 --> 00:53:30,096
..and so has turned dark and ugly.

731
00:53:30,639 --> 00:53:32,004
What are you laughing at?

732
00:53:32,675 --> 00:53:35,007
Your faces look just as neglected.

733
00:53:36,445 --> 00:53:38,003
Is Yusuf expected soon?

734
00:53:38,981 --> 00:53:42,109
I don't know when he will come.

735
00:53:42,585 --> 00:53:44,712
He just disappears for days
without informing me.

736
00:53:45,187 --> 00:53:47,985
Only to suddenly reappear
with a shameless smile saying..

737
00:53:48,057 --> 00:53:49,388
..I went on a picnic with friends.

738
00:53:50,126 --> 00:53:53,027
He makes me so angry.
What can I say?

739
00:53:53,696 --> 00:53:59,464
But that child is so lovable,
I can't stay angry for too long.

740
00:54:00,736 --> 00:54:02,431
Here, have some sweets.

741
00:54:02,738 --> 00:54:05,138
My nephew has sent
them from Agra. Wow!

742
00:54:08,144 --> 00:54:12,046
Dear, why don't you tell
Yusuf not to do such things?

743
00:54:12,481 --> 00:54:16,042
By Allah's grace nothing bad
has happened yet.

744
00:54:16,185 --> 00:54:19,018
But he shouldn't keep
disappearing like this.

745
00:54:19,088 --> 00:54:21,249
Will you explain to him?
- Yes.

746
00:54:21,490 --> 00:54:23,082
Or do you behave the same as well?

747
00:54:23,626 --> 00:54:26,220
No, no. Why don't you call Yusuf up?

748
00:54:26,362 --> 00:54:28,057
We will know where he is.

749
00:54:28,531 --> 00:54:32,297
He had called up the day
of the bomb blasts

750
00:54:32,434 --> 00:54:34,026
He said he was absolutely fine..

751
00:54:34,103 --> 00:54:35,764
..and was coming home for dinner.

752
00:54:36,105 --> 00:54:38,665
But he neither came nor
has he called since.

753
00:54:39,175 --> 00:54:41,302
Now the idiot has
switched off his phone.

754
00:54:44,747 --> 00:54:47,079
- We don't have his new number.

755
00:54:47,650 --> 00:54:50,585
There.. it's written over there, see?

756
00:54:54,790 --> 00:54:57,258
We will call him up.
- Have some sweets first.

757
00:54:57,626 --> 00:54:59,093
Can't. Stomach upset.
- Yes.

758
00:54:59,161 --> 00:55:00,458
Both of you have stomach upset.

759
00:55:00,596 --> 00:55:03,292
No, no.
- Then eat it. Okay.

760
00:55:03,799 --> 00:55:05,130
32376..

761
00:55:05,267 --> 00:55:07,599
Hey! What are you doing?
I will take the sweets with me.

762
00:55:07,670 --> 00:55:11,128
Wait, I will wrap it up for you.
- Remember 986982..

763
00:55:11,273 --> 00:55:13,468
- You children must have some names.

764
00:55:13,676 --> 00:55:17,203
- Yes, we do, he is Su..
- Suleman.

765
00:55:17,813 --> 00:55:20,475
Suleman. And you?
- Majid.

766
00:55:21,650 --> 00:55:24,084
Suleman, Majid.

767
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:26,511
Majid.. Suleman

768
00:55:27,623 --> 00:55:30,490
- Hey, Suresh! How much time?
- Coming! Come on, Suresh!

769
00:55:32,161 --> 00:55:33,651
Bye, aunt!
- Come on! - Come on!

770
00:55:33,796 --> 00:55:35,491
I told you people to wait!
Why did you come here?

771
00:55:39,101 --> 00:55:40,159
Come on!

772
00:56:02,858 --> 00:56:06,157
Yes! What's wrong?
-What's going on inside?

773
00:56:08,864 --> 00:56:12,197
Nothing. We are just chilling,
man. What's wrong?

774
00:56:13,135 --> 00:56:14,864
Don't you have any other work?

775
00:56:15,804 --> 00:56:18,272
Go and look for the culprits of the blasts.

776
00:56:19,642 --> 00:56:22,167
Get out of the car right now.
- Hey, hold on. Hold on! Okay.

777
00:56:22,344 --> 00:56:25,177
Baby, just relax! Yes!
Yes, I am okay! Yes, what?

778
00:56:25,881 --> 00:56:28,179
What do you have in there?
Cocaine?

779
00:56:28,517 --> 00:56:30,178
Hey.. just lay off, okay?

780
00:56:30,853 --> 00:56:33,720
Actually you know what?
I feel like spitting on your face.

781
00:56:33,789 --> 00:56:38,522
Spitting.. - Hey! Stop!
What are you doing? - Stop there!

782
00:56:38,594 --> 00:56:40,494
- Let go of him! Don't do this!
- 'What are you doing?'

783
00:56:41,664 --> 00:56:44,565
Kadam, what was the need
to create such a scene?

784
00:56:45,768 --> 00:56:48,202
And Patil, you.
Don't you understand!

785
00:56:48,704 --> 00:56:51,229
Are you a rookie? Sir,
they were doing drugs, we saw them!

786
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:53,203
Get their medical test
done in the hospital.

787
00:56:53,275 --> 00:56:56,244
They will test positive!
I don't want to hear a thing.

788
00:56:56,312 --> 00:56:57,574
I don't even want to see their faces.

789
00:56:57,646 --> 00:56:59,307
Please do something about them!
- Yes!

790
00:56:59,815 --> 00:57:02,375
Both of you, outside.
- Don't you trust us, sir?

791
00:57:02,551 --> 00:57:04,712
Get them out now or I am leaving!

792
00:57:04,787 --> 00:57:07,847
Please sit, sir! Please sit.
I will do it. - Come on, Kadam.

793
00:57:07,923 --> 00:57:10,915
I said get out! - Why are you
not listening to me, sir?

794
00:57:11,193 --> 00:57:13,218
I don't want to.
Now get out of here.

795
00:57:16,298 --> 00:57:18,266
There is no use working day and night!

796
00:57:24,807 --> 00:57:27,674
If it's so troublesome then quit the job.

797
00:57:28,210 --> 00:57:29,268
No one is keeping you here.

798
00:57:29,812 --> 00:57:34,613
Patil, take him.
- Yes. Come on. - Come on!

799
00:57:47,930 --> 00:57:49,488
Hey..

800
00:58:01,944 --> 00:58:03,434
O Kadam!

801
00:58:06,348 --> 00:58:10,409
Hey, I already told you that crying
in uniform is not allowed.

802
00:58:10,919 --> 00:58:13,786
When the tears start to flow,
leak them out.

803
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:18,886
Hey, this was nothing.

804
00:58:19,628 --> 00:58:24,395
You know, once I had arrested
a very famous man.

805
00:58:26,635 --> 00:58:27,966
With such a large suitcase.

806
00:58:28,871 --> 00:58:31,533
And do you know what
was in the bag? Cocaine!

807
00:58:34,009 --> 00:58:37,274
I don't know what transpired
between my senior and the man..

808
00:58:37,346 --> 00:58:38,745
..but he was instantly let off.

809
00:58:39,782 --> 00:58:43,274
My senior tells me,
Patil, it's because of..

810
00:58:43,352 --> 00:58:47,311
..cops like you that
the force is being slandered.

811
00:58:47,523 --> 00:58:49,286
With so many years of experience..

812
00:58:49,358 --> 00:58:50,757
..you still don't have brains?

813
00:58:52,628 --> 00:58:56,029
That's not cocaine,
it's just sugar.

814
00:58:57,433 --> 00:59:00,698
I said, sir? He says, yes,
this is just plain sugar!

815
00:59:02,771 --> 00:59:06,730
I said, fine, sir, why don't you
drink it with your tea?

816
00:59:07,576 --> 00:59:10,568
He says, no, I can't. I am diabetic.

817
00:59:16,385 --> 00:59:22,346
I am your senior, when I crack
a joke you should laugh. Understand?

818
00:59:22,991 --> 00:59:24,856
Shall I tickle you?

819
00:59:25,527 --> 00:59:30,362
Come on Come on!
- Let us get a drink. Come on!

820
00:59:51,420 --> 00:59:52,751
Platform number..

821
01:00:39,335 --> 01:00:41,269
Papa, look, there!
- Come.

822
01:00:45,608 --> 01:00:49,271
Why are we here?
- Come!

823
01:00:50,479 --> 01:00:54,415
Come.
- Papa! No!

824
01:00:55,284 --> 01:00:57,878
I'll not come.
- Come.

825
01:00:58,354 --> 01:00:59,685
Come quickly, don't be afraid.

826
01:00:59,755 --> 01:01:02,349
I am scared.
- Be careful! - Father.

827
01:01:02,625 --> 01:01:05,025
Papa, come get me!
- O God!

828
01:01:05,561 --> 01:01:08,997
Just put your foot here.
- Mother, come fast!

829
01:01:09,365 --> 01:01:15,361
Mother. - Hey, be careful.
- Hold my hand.

830
01:01:16,372 --> 01:01:20,308
Mother! - Come quickly,
what are you waiting for?

831
01:01:20,376 --> 01:01:24,369
Hold my hand. - Yes.
- Mother! Come. Come..

832
01:01:24,446 --> 01:01:26,539
Yes, that's it. that's it.

833
01:01:34,990 --> 01:01:36,457
He has kept it so well.

834
01:01:36,925 --> 01:01:40,053
Walk quietly.
It must be expensive, isn't it?

835
01:01:40,329 --> 01:01:41,728
Come. - No.
- l' m telling you to come along.

836
01:01:42,331 --> 01:01:46,631
Come, Come here, dear.

837
01:01:51,940 --> 01:01:55,398
That one. That one.
Is this a good perfume?

838
01:01:56,745 --> 01:01:59,407
Wait! Wait! Show me.

839
01:02:02,351 --> 01:02:05,343
It's good. - Father, for me?
- It's a ladies' perfume.

840
01:02:05,421 --> 01:02:08,447
Ladies? What perfume?
Do you want it, dear?

841
01:02:09,024 --> 01:02:11,458
For me?
- Don't spray it on his face.

842
01:02:11,627 --> 01:02:13,754
Take.
- He'll spray it on his face.

843
01:02:17,366 --> 01:02:20,426
Excuse me. Do you want
to buy the perfume?

844
01:02:21,503 --> 01:02:23,368
Buy it?

845
01:02:24,773 --> 01:02:25,831
What?

846
01:02:28,377 --> 01:02:31,437
Coffee. Do you have coffee perfume?

847
01:02:31,513 --> 01:02:32,912
Coffee?
- Yes.

848
01:02:33,382 --> 01:02:36,647
Coffee perfume?
- No.

849
01:02:41,390 --> 01:02:42,448
It's very strong.

850
01:02:42,991 --> 01:02:44,049
Come.

851
01:02:44,660 --> 01:02:45,854
It's for 10,500 rupees.

852
01:02:46,862 --> 01:02:47,920
O my God!

853
01:02:47,996 --> 01:02:49,588
Not the entire stuff.
Just one bottle.

854
01:02:50,799 --> 01:02:53,666
Sir, I am quoting the price of just one bottle.
1 0,500 rupees.

855
01:02:53,736 --> 01:02:55,397
O my God!
- No.

856
01:02:57,406 --> 01:03:00,136
Do people buy it?
Or is it just for show?

857
01:03:00,409 --> 01:03:01,467
Everybody buys it, sir.

858
01:03:02,544 --> 01:03:06,412
Only you spray it for free every day.

859
01:03:06,682 --> 01:03:08,081
Tell me, sir. Do you want it?

860
01:03:10,018 --> 01:03:12,680
If you have coffee perfume,
I will buy it. I like that.

861
01:03:13,422 --> 01:03:16,823
This is very strong.
- Come! Let's go!

862
01:03:17,893 --> 01:03:18,951
Come on!

863
01:03:19,428 --> 01:03:20,486
Come on!

864
01:03:20,562 --> 01:03:23,497
Hey! Hey! Stop!
- Leave me!

865
01:03:23,565 --> 01:03:24,827
Sir! Sir! Sir!
- What happened?

866
01:03:24,900 --> 01:03:26,162
He is the same guy
I have told you about!

867
01:03:26,435 --> 01:03:27,493
What did he do?

868
01:03:27,569 --> 01:03:28,627
I have seen him many times.

869
01:03:28,704 --> 01:03:30,638
He just comes here, sprays
perfume and then leaves.

870
01:03:30,706 --> 01:03:32,571
Stop! Stop! I say stop!

871
01:03:32,775 --> 01:03:35,437
Stop! Stop!
- Just keep walking.

872
01:03:35,511 --> 01:03:37,103
Security!
Call the police!

873
01:03:37,446 --> 01:03:40,108
Catch him! Security! Catch him!

874
01:03:40,449 --> 01:03:42,178
Hey! Hey! Leave!
- Mother.

875
01:03:43,919 --> 01:03:44,977
He has a wife.

876
01:03:46,188 --> 01:03:49,919
Only son of his parents.
And now he can never write again.

877
01:03:51,593 --> 01:03:52,651
He lost his right hand.

878
01:03:56,465 --> 01:03:57,523
Oh God!

879
01:03:58,534 --> 01:04:01,594
Shekhar, that guy is just 28, man.

880
01:04:06,208 --> 01:04:07,539
And you are just 32.

881
01:04:09,478 --> 01:04:10,536
You are still not scared.

882
01:04:13,482 --> 01:04:16,076
You can afford it but you
don't want to buy a car.

883
01:04:16,819 --> 01:04:21,756
Every day, you want to commute
only by train. Up and down!

884
01:04:21,824 --> 01:04:24,486
Don't start again,
Shekhar! - Listen to me.

885
01:04:25,494 --> 01:04:27,485
People can't wait to get
away from this country.

886
01:04:28,497 --> 01:04:30,488
But you prefer to refuse any such..

887
01:04:30,566 --> 01:04:32,033
..opportunities that come your way.

888
01:04:32,901 --> 01:04:34,493
Because you want to
stay in this country..

889
01:04:34,570 --> 01:04:36,231
..in India and reform it.

890
01:04:36,839 --> 01:04:38,170
You are a big patriot.

891
01:04:38,507 --> 01:04:40,566
What were we talking about
and what are you saying?

892
01:04:40,642 --> 01:04:43,577
Tell me one thing, how much
income tax do you pay?

893
01:04:44,780 --> 01:04:45,838
3 lakhs?

894
01:04:47,182 --> 01:04:49,514
Has the government ever filled one..

895
01:04:49,585 --> 01:04:51,917
..pothole on the road with that money?

896
01:04:55,858 --> 01:04:57,519
Nikhil, what I am trying to say is..

897
01:04:57,593 --> 01:05:00,528
..U.S, U.K present a far better lifestyle..

898
01:05:00,596 --> 01:05:02,120
..there is security there.

899
01:05:02,197 --> 01:05:04,859
So you go! Go to US, UK!

900
01:05:04,933 --> 01:05:06,992
Where you will get
a good lifestyle and security.

901
01:05:07,069 --> 01:05:08,127
You go!

902
01:05:12,541 --> 01:05:15,009
Of course, I am going!
You can rot here forever!

903
01:05:15,544 --> 01:05:16,602
Do one thing!

904
01:05:16,678 --> 01:05:18,669
Till the next blast occurs keep
traveling in local trains!

905
01:05:18,747 --> 01:05:20,146
Along with your wife. Fine!

906
01:05:20,816 --> 01:05:22,283
And now you are going
to have a baby too!

907
01:05:31,093 --> 01:05:32,958
Come on! Come on!

908
01:05:33,028 --> 01:05:35,553
Listen to me! - Leave!

909
01:05:35,631 --> 01:05:37,758
Papa!
- Come on!

910
01:05:40,168 --> 01:05:42,830
First he used to come alone,
today he brings his family.

911
01:05:43,171 --> 01:05:44,900
Tomorrow he might bring
his entire neighborhood.

912
01:05:44,973 --> 01:05:46,031
Security!

913
01:05:46,108 --> 01:05:49,168
If he is ever seen again then
file a police complaint! Fine!

914
01:05:49,244 --> 01:05:50,768
It's okay!
- Papa!

915
01:05:53,115 --> 01:05:54,173
Papa!

916
01:06:14,202 --> 01:06:15,260
I will open the door.

917
01:06:19,608 --> 01:06:20,802
Madam, I have come
from Mehta printers.

918
01:06:21,677 --> 01:06:22,735
Here are your cards.

919
01:06:49,638 --> 01:06:52,163
Sister! Are you alright?

920
01:07:28,677 --> 01:07:29,735
Hello.

921
01:07:30,145 --> 01:07:31,203
Who?

922
01:07:31,947 --> 01:07:33,005
Yes, just a minute.

923
01:07:33,081 --> 01:07:34,878
Suresh, there is a call for you.

924
01:07:36,818 --> 01:07:37,876
You have to take it now.

925
01:07:47,095 --> 01:07:48,153
Hello.

926
01:07:52,834 --> 01:07:53,892
Yes.

927
01:07:55,303 --> 01:07:56,895
I told you, I can't pay you right now.

928
01:07:58,707 --> 01:08:01,039
You will get it when I have the money.
Have faith in me.

929
01:08:04,246 --> 01:08:05,304
What?

930
01:08:07,983 --> 01:08:09,041
What will you do?

931
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:12,778
Do what you want.

932
01:08:13,722 --> 01:08:16,316
You will not get the money!
Do what you want!

933
01:08:23,398 --> 01:08:25,798
Please don't hand me
any calls without asking.

934
01:08:27,402 --> 01:08:28,869
And I will clear your bill soon.

935
01:08:28,937 --> 01:08:30,199
Have I asked you for the money?

936
01:08:30,272 --> 01:08:32,206
You haven't asked for it but
I can see it on your face, boss.

937
01:08:33,341 --> 01:08:34,740
Will you have some tea?

938
01:08:35,077 --> 01:08:38,069
Chhotu! Get tea for Suresh.
Take a seat.

939
01:08:51,226 --> 01:08:52,750
Hello, sir.
- Hello.

940
01:08:54,029 --> 01:08:57,487
Sir, did you find out
who did the bomb blast? - No.

941
01:09:00,035 --> 01:09:02,435
Did you arrest anyone or not?
- Not yet, but soon.

942
01:09:03,772 --> 01:09:04,830
Hurry up, sir.

943
01:09:04,906 --> 01:09:07,773
It's been so many days since
the bomb blast and still no arrests?

944
01:09:07,843 --> 01:09:08,969
Arrest somebody!

945
01:09:09,778 --> 01:09:12,440
Get in! Come on!
- Sir? What have I done?

946
01:09:13,048 --> 01:09:15,243
Should we arrest the ones
responsible for the bomb blast?

947
01:09:15,317 --> 01:09:17,785
Yes, sir. - Or should
we arrest just anyone?

948
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:19,519
Sorry, sir.
- Then!

949
01:09:19,788 --> 01:09:22,256
Sorry, sir! Sir!
- Leave! People!

950
01:09:29,931 --> 01:09:33,799
The public just loves to pester us
with impossible problems.

951
01:09:37,806 --> 01:09:39,330
Do you know what your problem is?

952
01:09:40,408 --> 01:09:43,275
An art film plays
incessantly in your mind.

953
01:09:44,279 --> 01:09:45,337
In black and white.

954
01:09:46,414 --> 01:09:50,077
Watch the film, if you want,
but don't get involved in its act.

955
01:09:52,087 --> 01:09:54,817
Find a nice corner seat in the theatre..

956
01:09:54,890 --> 01:09:56,949
..of your mind and just watch.

957
01:09:57,893 --> 01:10:00,828
Look at me, I have been
quietly watching this film..

958
01:10:00,896 --> 01:10:02,420
..for the last 35 years.

959
01:10:03,031 --> 01:10:04,089
Don't get involved!

960
01:10:08,036 --> 01:10:11,028
You mean I should spend
the next 35 years like you?

961
01:10:25,053 --> 01:10:34,189
"From where did this
storm arrive in a jiffy?"

962
01:10:35,397 --> 01:10:44,203
"From where did this
storm arrive in a jiffy?"

963
01:10:45,607 --> 01:10:50,203
"In just one breath. "

964
01:10:55,417 --> 01:10:57,282
"A bit!"

965
01:10:57,352 --> 01:10:59,081
"A bit!"

966
01:11:02,157 --> 01:11:08,221
"Life! Life!"

967
01:11:09,030 --> 01:11:14,229
"Life! Life!"

968
01:11:23,511 --> 01:11:29,245
"Suddenly what noise is
resonating in the ears?"

969
01:11:30,318 --> 01:11:35,984
"I just spoke to myself.. "

970
01:11:37,058 --> 01:11:43,122
"Suddenly what noise is
resonating in the ears?"

971
01:11:44,065 --> 01:11:49,264
"l just spoke to myself.. "

972
01:11:50,472 --> 01:11:52,463
"A bit!"

973
01:11:53,942 --> 01:11:56,137
"A bit!"

974
01:11:57,078 --> 01:12:02,607
"Life! Life!"

975
01:12:03,952 --> 01:12:09,151
"Life! Life!"

976
01:12:18,233 --> 01:12:23,967
"Suddenly why did
I see my own body?"

977
01:12:25,173 --> 01:12:30,975
"l wish I could talk to him a bit. "

978
01:12:32,113 --> 01:12:37,642
"Suddenly why did
I see my own body?"

979
01:12:38,987 --> 01:12:44,516
"l wish I could talk to him a bit. "

980
01:12:45,460 --> 01:12:47,985
"A bit!"

981
01:12:48,997 --> 01:12:50,988
"A bit!"

982
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:57,336
"Life! Life!"

983
01:12:58,740 --> 01:13:04,007
"Life! Life!"

984
01:13:13,154 --> 01:13:22,222
"From where did this
storm arrive in a jiffy? "

985
01:13:23,498 --> 01:13:32,236
"From where did this
storm arrive in a jiffy? "

986
01:13:34,042 --> 01:13:38,570
"In just one breath. "

987
01:13:43,518 --> 01:13:45,315
"A bit!"

988
01:13:45,387 --> 01:13:47,651
"A bit!"

989
01:13:50,325 --> 01:13:56,264
"Life! Life!"

990
01:13:57,132 --> 01:14:02,263
"Life! Life!"

991
01:14:04,072 --> 01:14:09,066
"Life! Life!"

992
01:14:10,144 --> 01:14:14,808
Didn't I tell you? Salman!
Exact Salman! - "Your name.. "

993
01:14:14,882 --> 01:14:15,940
Wonderful man!

994
01:14:16,017 --> 01:14:17,484
One minute.
You really look like him!

995
01:14:17,552 --> 01:14:18,883
He looks like him!

996
01:14:18,953 --> 01:14:20,215
Excuse me!
- Yes!

997
01:14:21,556 --> 01:14:22,614
Where did you buy the T-2hirt from?

998
01:14:23,824 --> 01:14:26,816
City Centre.
- Thank you. Ok.

999
01:14:26,894 --> 01:14:27,952
Hey Chhotu, take care.

1000
01:14:28,029 --> 01:14:29,223
Aamir Khan!

1001
01:14:29,564 --> 01:14:30,997
He really looks like Aamir Khan!

1002
01:14:31,065 --> 01:14:32,930
He should have been fair!
- We will apply limestone.

1003
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:34,058
Enough!

1004
01:14:34,835 --> 01:14:36,234
Stop it! That's enough!

1005
01:14:37,104 --> 01:14:38,799
Suresh! Look!

1006
01:14:44,078 --> 01:14:46,069
We will meet later.
- Fine, bye.

1007
01:14:46,147 --> 01:14:47,205
Ok, bye. Come on!

1008
01:14:50,585 --> 01:14:51,677
He is the one!
- Come.. Come!

1009
01:14:52,086 --> 01:14:53,246
Why are you wasting your time?

1010
01:14:53,854 --> 01:14:54,912
You had followed him the other day.

1011
01:14:54,989 --> 01:14:57,150
Could you find anything?
- Not you, I'm telling him.

1012
01:14:57,224 --> 01:14:59,124
You're out of your mind.

1013
01:14:59,193 --> 01:15:02,219
They have a bike!
Will you chase him on foot?

1014
01:15:08,736 --> 01:15:09,794
Isn't he your friend?

1015
01:15:12,873 --> 01:15:13,931
Yes.

1016
01:15:17,011 --> 01:15:18,069
No!

1017
01:15:51,112 --> 01:15:52,170
Rickshaw!

1018
01:15:52,913 --> 01:15:54,210
Come on, quickly.

1019
01:16:04,191 --> 01:16:06,659
Brother, did you just see?
- What?

1020
01:16:07,662 --> 01:16:09,653
That man parked a scooter there
and went away in a rickshaw.

1021
01:16:10,598 --> 01:16:11,656
So?

1022
01:16:14,035 --> 01:16:15,866
He deserted his scooter!

1023
01:16:48,202 --> 01:16:49,260
I am coming!

1024
01:16:49,970 --> 01:16:51,028
I am coming!

1025
01:17:14,261 --> 01:17:15,956
You are so late!
- Sorry.

1026
01:17:16,030 --> 01:17:17,122
Sit!

1027
01:17:20,267 --> 01:17:22,235
Come on Suresh,
let us go back.

1028
01:17:22,303 --> 01:17:24,134
That girl is his girlfriend.

1029
01:17:24,205 --> 01:17:27,732
Quiet you fool! Do you have
a telescope in your hands?

1030
01:17:29,009 --> 01:17:30,237
How do you know
who is under the veil?

1031
01:17:31,278 --> 01:17:35,214
Look at her gait! - You know,
they learn to act like that!

1032
01:17:36,016 --> 01:17:37,074
Come on.

1033
01:18:29,870 --> 01:18:32,464
"O dear saint Haji Ali!"

1034
01:18:36,343 --> 01:18:37,742
Brother, do you want a photo taken?
- I don't want it.

1035
01:18:37,812 --> 01:18:38,870
Brother, one photo.

1036
01:18:39,213 --> 01:18:42,205
Why are you scared now?
- Happy!

1037
01:18:42,283 --> 01:18:43,341
Come on.

1038
01:18:43,417 --> 01:18:45,180
"O dear saint Haji Ali!"

1039
01:18:45,252 --> 01:18:46,412
Didn't I tell you it's a girl?

1040
01:18:47,288 --> 01:18:48,346
So?

1041
01:18:48,422 --> 01:18:49,480
Can't girls be terrorists?

1042
01:18:49,824 --> 01:18:51,348
Who killed Rajiv Gandhi?

1043
01:18:51,826 --> 01:18:52,884
What was her name?

1044
01:18:54,094 --> 01:18:55,152
Dhanu.

1045
01:18:55,362 --> 01:18:56,420
Wasn't she a girl?

1046
01:18:56,497 --> 01:18:57,987
Do you know who he was?
- No.

1047
01:18:58,833 --> 01:18:59,891
He was the prime minister!

1048
01:18:59,967 --> 01:19:01,025
I know that.

1049
01:19:01,101 --> 01:19:05,401
The blast that took place at the gateway.
Who was it in it?

1050
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:06,898
That was a girl too.

1051
01:19:07,842 --> 01:19:08,900
Don't think, come on.

1052
01:19:11,278 --> 01:19:13,838
Hey, who did this to my scooter?
- Get away!

1053
01:19:13,914 --> 01:19:18,851
Hey, sir.
- Where are you going!

1054
01:19:19,119 --> 01:19:20,780
Inspector, my scooter?
- Get away! Come here!

1055
01:19:20,855 --> 01:19:22,516
Sir, who did this to my scooter?

1056
01:19:22,857 --> 01:19:25,189
Sir, who did this to my scooter?

1057
01:19:25,259 --> 01:19:26,385
Where did you go leaving it here?

1058
01:19:26,460 --> 01:19:27,859
Sir l.. - Why did you dash
off in the rickshaw?

1059
01:19:27,928 --> 01:19:29,793
Sir, listen to me. I am telling you.
My scooter broke down.

1060
01:19:29,864 --> 01:19:31,195
What is your name?
- My name is Ashok.

1061
01:19:31,265 --> 01:19:33,165
Where do you live?
- I live there.

1062
01:19:33,234 --> 01:19:34,394
Sir, it was an emergency,
that's why I left it here.

1063
01:19:34,468 --> 01:19:35,799
Show me your license!
- Sir, I will show you.

1064
01:19:36,871 --> 01:19:37,929
Here, is my license.

1065
01:19:38,138 --> 01:19:39,196
Sir, listen to me!

1066
01:19:39,273 --> 01:19:40,331
Who will assemble
my scooter back again?

1067
01:19:50,150 --> 01:19:51,310
That girl is in a veil.

1068
01:19:52,386 --> 01:19:53,876
Only her face is visible.

1069
01:19:53,954 --> 01:19:56,946
Why? What else do you want to see?

1070
01:19:57,424 --> 01:19:58,891
No, I mean..

1071
01:19:59,894 --> 01:20:00,952
They are like that.

1072
01:20:01,428 --> 01:20:03,089
They hide everything from the world.

1073
01:20:03,898 --> 01:20:05,525
We are the only ones
roaming around freely.

1074
01:20:15,109 --> 01:20:17,236
Suresh, how are you?
- Fine.

1075
01:20:17,311 --> 01:20:19,905
What are you doing these days?
The same computer business?

1076
01:20:19,980 --> 01:20:21,914
Yes. -Then I found you
at the right time.

1077
01:20:22,316 --> 01:20:24,841
These days I am working with them!

1078
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:27,979
They need 50-60 computers promptly.

1079
01:20:29,189 --> 01:20:30,247
You will profit a lot.

1080
01:20:30,324 --> 01:20:32,849
Give me some commission too.

1081
01:20:34,428 --> 01:20:35,588
But it is a bit urgent.

1082
01:20:36,530 --> 01:20:37,861
Come and meet them quickly.

1083
01:20:37,932 --> 01:20:40,924
If someone else gets the order
then neither of us will benefit.

1084
01:20:41,468 --> 01:20:42,594
So are you surely going to do it?

1085
01:20:43,470 --> 01:20:44,937
Fine. I'll be waiting for you.
- Okay.

1086
01:20:45,005 --> 01:20:46,097
See you.

1087
01:20:46,173 --> 01:20:50,007
"Saint Haji Ali!"

1088
01:20:50,077 --> 01:20:53,604
Good, if not the terrorist but
you got some business.

1089
01:20:55,015 --> 01:20:57,347
I don't want to do any business
with these people.

1090
01:20:57,418 --> 01:20:58,476
Understood.

1091
01:21:00,054 --> 01:21:02,614
Come on! Earn while
you are getting a chance.

1092
01:21:03,223 --> 01:21:04,281
In life, you should adjust..

1093
01:21:04,358 --> 01:21:05,950
Don't teach me
what I should do in life.

1094
01:21:10,364 --> 01:21:14,232
Where did they go? - I don't know.
They were right here.

1095
01:21:14,301 --> 01:21:15,529
What were you doing?
- Sorry.

1096
01:21:17,504 --> 01:21:20,098
Listen, there are plastic bottles
and jars in this bag.

1097
01:21:20,174 --> 01:21:21,903
Use this table and
other furniture yourself..

1098
01:21:21,976 --> 01:21:24,570
..don't sell it a junk.

1099
01:21:25,913 --> 01:21:27,904
The city of Mumbai will
observe silence for 2 minutes..

1100
01:21:27,982 --> 01:21:29,916
..and pay homage to the deceased!..

1101
01:21:29,984 --> 01:21:31,611
..The public mourning shall..

1102
01:21:32,252 --> 01:21:33,412
'On this occasion..'

1103
01:21:37,992 --> 01:21:40,654
Anusha, are you studying or watching TV?

1104
01:21:41,261 --> 01:21:42,319
Come on, switch off the TV.

1105
01:21:42,396 --> 01:21:45,661
If you fail this time,
your father will lecture me.

1106
01:21:46,066 --> 01:21:48,057
Mom, look at the size of this book.

1107
01:21:48,135 --> 01:21:51,002
Do you think I can read
it in a day and pass?

1108
01:21:51,071 --> 01:21:53,232
It's impossible mama!
I'm going to fail.

1109
01:21:53,540 --> 01:21:55,440
Aren't you ashamed
to say such a thing?

1110
01:21:55,509 --> 01:21:57,136
Mom, I have an idea.

1111
01:21:57,277 --> 01:22:02,010
Let's call the college and tell them
there's a big bomb in the college!

1112
01:22:02,082 --> 01:22:03,379
The exams will be cancelled!

1113
01:22:03,450 --> 01:22:06,942
Don't be ridiculous!
- Mom, it can really happen.

1114
01:22:07,287 --> 01:22:10,279
Do you know what, everybody is
so scared of this train bomb blast!

1115
01:22:10,357 --> 01:22:12,951
Just the other day, someone
called Delhi and said..

1116
01:22:13,027 --> 01:22:15,325
..there is a very
big bomb near India Gate.

1117
01:22:15,396 --> 01:22:17,261
The entire bomb squad
had reached there.

1118
01:22:17,331 --> 01:22:19,094
But did they find anything there?
Nothing!

1119
01:22:20,467 --> 01:22:22,628
The entire station was
evacuated in minutes.

1120
01:22:23,037 --> 01:22:24,197
But they didn't find anything there too.

1121
01:22:26,040 --> 01:22:29,476
Mom, you have no idea what
can be done with a rupee?

1122
01:22:39,586 --> 01:22:44,046
Police station!
There's a bomb in a mall.

1123
01:22:46,326 --> 01:22:48,055
There's a bomb at Center One Mall.

1124
01:22:49,563 --> 01:22:50,723
It will explode in 10 minutes.

1125
01:23:23,497 --> 01:23:24,555
What happened, sir?

1126
01:25:35,629 --> 01:25:39,156
Rupali, I think you need
to come out of it..

1127
01:25:39,233 --> 01:25:43,226
..as soon as possible.

1128
01:25:46,740 --> 01:25:49,903
And the only way is to get
involved in something else.

1129
01:25:52,746 --> 01:25:59,242
We were thinking..
Anandita will explain it to you.

1130
01:26:01,855 --> 01:26:08,192
Rupali, we were thinking of
doing a half hour story..

1131
01:26:08,262 --> 01:26:15,191
..about you and Ajay. Since you
were reporting right there..

1132
01:26:15,269 --> 01:26:20,730
..when all this happened, so.

1133
01:26:21,742 --> 01:26:23,607
I know it's very unfortunate!

1134
01:26:24,544 --> 01:26:25,636
You know what I am trying to say.

1135
01:26:26,747 --> 01:26:31,514
Of course if you have any
objections we won't do it.

1136
01:26:31,885 --> 01:26:33,944
Here is a rough script. And.

1137
01:27:13,860 --> 01:27:15,851
Enough! That's enough Bhoite!

1138
01:27:15,929 --> 01:27:19,695
Sir, no excuses today. It's your
retirement party today, Mr. Patil!

1139
01:27:19,766 --> 01:27:20,824
You will have to drink!

1140
01:27:21,868 --> 01:27:24,496
If I drink so much,
I will retire from this world.

1141
01:27:24,571 --> 01:27:28,667
What are you saying, Sir?
May you live for a 100 years!

1142
01:27:29,609 --> 01:27:33,909
I'm getting old now.
Time for illnesses to creep in..

1143
01:27:34,748 --> 01:27:35,806
You won't be ill,
if you follow my advice.

1144
01:27:36,450 --> 01:27:40,284
Exercise every day, build a few
muscles and you'll be fine.

1145
01:27:41,888 --> 01:27:44,356
Assume that I start exercising.
- Okay.

1146
01:27:45,359 --> 01:27:46,690
And I attain the fitness of a body builder.

1147
01:27:47,861 --> 01:27:52,594
But there's a bomb under my chair.

1148
01:27:53,633 --> 01:27:59,367
Bomb! I don't know
that I'm sitting on a bomb!

1149
01:28:00,807 --> 01:28:02,035
I'm busy showing off my body to you.

1150
01:28:02,642 --> 01:28:05,702
I'm busy showing off my body to you.
And BOOM!

1151
01:28:08,915 --> 01:28:12,043
Post-retirement I'm off to my village.
- Really?

1152
01:28:12,886 --> 01:28:16,322
Lest a rogue builder seizes
my land for construction..

1153
01:28:16,390 --> 01:28:19,052
..I want to do lots of farming.

1154
01:28:23,663 --> 01:28:29,499
There is a thief there,
who comes every day.

1155
01:28:30,404 --> 01:28:32,065
Who is the thief? It's a fox.

1156
01:28:33,940 --> 01:28:36,773
Every night it eats up the sugarcane.

1157
01:28:38,845 --> 01:28:45,478
I want to catch it red-handed.
And put him in jail.

1158
01:28:45,952 --> 01:28:49,353
In the zoo!
The animal garden. - Zoo!

1159
01:28:50,524 --> 01:28:55,018
Then I might just feel some
sense of accomplishment.

1160
01:28:59,900 --> 01:29:01,868
Don't laugh, I'm serious.

1161
01:29:04,871 --> 01:29:08,102
I haven't caught a single terrorist.

1162
01:29:10,710 --> 01:29:12,439
Or a famous thief.

1163
01:29:14,581 --> 01:29:16,105
I haven't done anything great.

1164
01:29:17,784 --> 01:29:19,615
In fact I haven't done anything.

1165
01:29:20,554 --> 01:29:21,612
I never got the chance.

1166
01:29:23,857 --> 01:29:25,051
But you guys should do some good.

1167
01:29:26,960 --> 01:29:29,121
Don't just blabber like me.

1168
01:29:39,005 --> 01:29:43,874
Looking at your eyes I feel you
should go to the toilet now.

1169
01:29:55,088 --> 01:29:56,715
Bhoite!
- Yes.

1170
01:29:56,857 --> 01:30:00,156
Don't eat too much Chinese food.
- Why?

1171
01:30:00,994 --> 01:30:02,928
Your eyes will start slanting.

1172
01:30:13,707 --> 01:30:15,800
Kadam! Kadam!

1173
01:30:15,876 --> 01:30:16,934
Open the door!

1174
01:30:17,010 --> 01:30:19,035
Kadam.
- Kadam, open the door!

1175
01:30:19,779 --> 01:30:21,178
Break the door.
- Push!

1176
01:30:22,048 --> 01:30:25,176
Kadam, open the door!
Kadam! Kadam!

1177
01:30:33,927 --> 01:30:35,053
Kadam! Kadam!

1178
01:31:01,555 --> 01:31:06,219
Yes, Kadam!

1179
01:31:12,032 --> 01:31:16,162
Calm down.. It's ok!

1180
01:31:51,104 --> 01:31:53,299
Nikhil?
- Yes!

1181
01:31:54,073 --> 01:31:55,563
Get me some water please?

1182
01:31:56,643 --> 01:31:57,701
Yes!

1183
01:32:19,465 --> 01:32:20,796
Sorry, you had to get up.

1184
01:32:22,135 --> 01:32:23,796
No problem.

1185
01:32:57,236 --> 01:32:59,227
Acute stress disorder.

1186
01:32:59,372 --> 01:33:02,239
That's what it's called.
There is nothing to it..

1187
01:33:02,308 --> 01:33:04,105
It's very, very common.

1188
01:33:04,711 --> 01:33:06,702
It's nothing to worry, Nikhil.

1189
01:33:06,846 --> 01:33:09,576
It will phase out as time passes,
don't worry.

1190
01:33:09,716 --> 01:33:13,846
It's been 4 days, Sheila.
- I know it's been 4 days. I know.

1191
01:33:14,120 --> 01:33:18,853
Take this medicine. There are drops too.
Don't forget them.

1192
01:33:19,726 --> 01:33:23,594
And if possible, try and
avoid loud sounds. Okay?

1193
01:33:24,530 --> 01:33:25,588
Yes!

1194
01:33:33,272 --> 01:33:34,603
Nikhil, tell me something.

1195
01:33:35,208 --> 01:33:38,143
Your experience of the bomb blast..

1196
01:33:38,211 --> 01:33:40,873
..have you shared it with anybody?

1197
01:33:48,221 --> 01:33:51,884
Nikhil, its okay to be scared.

1198
01:33:57,563 --> 01:33:58,621
Yes.

1199
01:34:05,204 --> 01:34:06,569
There is absolutely no hurry!

1200
01:34:06,773 --> 01:34:08,172
Just completely relax.

1201
01:34:09,776 --> 01:34:11,175
If there is anything
you feel like changing..

1202
01:34:11,244 --> 01:34:13,303
..then just go ahead.. yes!
- Take it.

1203
01:34:13,713 --> 01:34:14,771
Thank you.

1204
01:34:20,586 --> 01:34:22,645
Ready!
- Close that curtain!

1205
01:34:27,460 --> 01:34:28,518
Roll!

1206
01:34:29,929 --> 01:34:31,726
Production ID 14, take 1!

1207
01:34:32,932 --> 01:34:34,194
Action!

1208
01:34:35,201 --> 01:34:39,194
Hello, I am Rupali Joshi.
You know me..

1209
01:34:39,272 --> 01:34:41,467

..I'd like to pay homage
to the victims of..

1212
01:34:47,280 --> 01:34:50,215
..the train bomb blasts which occurred..

1213
01:34:50,283 --> 01:34:52,410
..on the 1 1th of July, 2006.

1214
01:34:53,886 --> 01:34:58,220
The 7l1 1 Relief Fund has been founded..

1215
01:34:58,291 --> 01:35:01,260
..to help the families of the victims.

1216
01:35:03,963 --> 01:35:09,230
I urge all of you to please contribute..

1217
01:35:09,302 --> 01:35:15,639
..generously to the 7l1 1 Relief Fund.

1218

We will do one more.
- Yes, yes, sure!

1219
01:35:18,978 --> 01:35:20,639
Not a problem!
- Action.

1228
01:35:44,337 --> 01:35:45,463

You know me as
a reporter for TV News.

1242
01:36:27,446 --> 01:36:32,577
1 1th July, 206..

1243
01:37:05,952 --> 01:37:07,010
Sorry!

1244
01:37:10,022 --> 01:37:11,080
I am..

1245
01:38:18,157 --> 01:38:20,421
A special announcement
for all the customers..

1246
01:38:20,493 --> 01:38:21,687
..present in our mall.

1247
01:38:22,161 --> 01:38:24,152
Please listen carefully
and do not panic!

1248
01:38:24,497 --> 01:38:26,431
I request you to cooperate and please..

1249
01:38:26,499 --> 01:38:28,433
..Leave the premises at the earliest!

1250
01:38:28,701 --> 01:38:30,635
Please don't touch any unknown thing.

1251
01:38:30,970 --> 01:38:33,438
Because we are looking
out for a suspected..

1252
01:38:33,506 --> 01:38:34,700
..bomb being placed in our premises.

1253
01:38:34,907 --> 01:38:36,568
But there is no need to panic!

1254
01:38:36,776 --> 01:38:38,038
But there is no need to panic!

1255
01:38:38,177 --> 01:38:39,838
Our security people will help you out.

1256
01:38:39,979 --> 01:38:41,571
Don't panic! Don't panic!

1257
01:38:42,181 --> 01:38:43,580
Don't panic! Don't panic!

1258
01:38:43,849 --> 01:38:45,578
Don't panic! Don't panic!

1259
01:38:45,918 --> 01:38:48,045
Don't panic! Don't panic!

1260
01:38:55,061 --> 01:38:58,462
It's nothing papa!
Please be careful! Walk slowly!

1261
01:39:02,535 --> 01:39:04,730
Papa, what happened? Papa!
What happened? Papa!

1262
01:39:05,504 --> 01:39:08,496
Papa, what happened? Papa!
What happened? Papa!

1263
01:39:08,874 --> 01:39:13,868
Somebody please help me!
Help me please!

1264
01:39:15,614 --> 01:39:18,208
Somebody please help me!

1265
01:39:18,751 --> 01:39:19,877
Papa, what's happening?

1266
01:39:19,952 --> 01:39:24,218
Help! Please help!

1267
01:39:27,626 --> 01:39:30,220
Somebody please help me!
- What's happening to you?

1268
01:39:30,563 --> 01:39:33,088
Get up, uncle! Carefully!

1269
01:39:33,165 --> 01:39:35,030
Are you alright?!

1270
01:39:42,508 --> 01:39:43,566
Papa, talk to me!

1271
01:39:43,642 --> 01:39:46,042
Relax, papa. Please!
- Carefully!

1272
01:39:50,049 --> 01:39:51,778
Are you fine, papa!

1273
01:39:53,185 --> 01:39:54,243
Run! Run!

1274
01:39:58,257 --> 01:39:59,519
Carefully!

1275
01:39:59,792 --> 01:40:00,918
Nothing will happen to you!

1276
01:40:10,603 --> 01:40:11,661
Come on, quickly!

1277
01:40:12,071 --> 01:40:13,129
Papa..

1278
01:40:20,746 --> 01:40:23,146
Nothing will happen to you! Papa!

1279
01:40:47,640 --> 01:40:49,574
An anonymous call made..

1280
01:40:49,642 --> 01:40:52,577
..to Raghuleela Mall situated in Kandivli..

1281
01:40:52,645 --> 01:40:54,044
..created a furor this afternoon.

1282
01:40:54,580 --> 01:40:55,638
The caller warned
the Mall authorities of..

1283
01:40:55,714 --> 01:40:56,772
..a possible explosive device
placed within its premises.

1284
01:40:56,916 --> 01:40:58,577
The entire mall was vacated..

1285
01:40:58,651 --> 01:41:01,176
..by the police and
searched thoroughly.

1286
01:41:01,320 --> 01:41:03,720
No explosives were found.

1287
01:41:03,989 --> 01:41:07,584
The police say, that after
a big terrorist activity..

1288
01:41:07,660 --> 01:41:10,185
..receiving such hoax calls is common.

1289
01:41:10,329 --> 01:41:13,594
These calls are made from
a public phone booth that's..

1290
01:41:13,666 --> 01:41:18,330
..why it is impossible to
find out who makes these calls.

1291
01:41:18,671 --> 01:41:21,606
The people that make such
calls don't realise that..

1292
01:41:21,674 --> 01:41:23,608
..they waste the time of the police..

1293
01:41:23,676 --> 01:41:25,735
..and the money of the people.

1294
01:41:26,145 --> 01:41:28,739
They are creating terror
amongst the people.

1295
01:41:29,014 --> 01:41:33,883
And in the ensuing furor,
anyone can lose their life.

1296
01:41:34,220 --> 01:41:36,154
After the 1 1th July bomb blast.

1297
01:41:36,355 --> 01:41:38,346
No one is ready to take a risk.

1298
01:41:40,226 --> 01:41:41,284
What is the matter?

1299
01:41:42,628 --> 01:41:45,358
..psychologists are trying to study..

1300
01:41:50,035 --> 01:41:51,093
Why are you crying?

1301
01:41:54,306 --> 01:41:56,968
Mumbai police has found that..
- What is the matter?

1302
01:42:00,179 --> 01:42:01,237
I..

1303
01:42:02,181 --> 01:42:05,639
..the psyche of pranksters
who make such hoax calls..

1304
01:42:16,262 --> 01:42:21,859
And this, right here..
is where we live.

1305
01:42:23,068 --> 01:42:29,064
Home sweet home. Nice, isn't it?

1306
01:42:31,877 --> 01:42:34,402
Hello.. Speaking.

1307
01:42:35,414 --> 01:42:38,076
Hey! How are you?

1308
01:42:39,351 --> 01:42:40,409
When did you arrive?

1309
01:42:40,753 --> 01:42:41,879
Vinod.
- Yes! Yes!

1310
01:42:42,755 --> 01:42:46,156
You're coming home, aren't you?

1311
01:42:46,825 --> 01:42:47,883
Let me talk to him.

1312
01:42:48,093 --> 01:42:49,685
Oh shut up, lost son of Bush.

1313
01:42:49,828 --> 01:42:51,090
What do you mean you are jetlagged?

1314
01:42:51,430 --> 01:42:52,954
Give me the phone.
- Just a minute.

1315
01:42:53,232 --> 01:42:54,961
Yes, talk to her.
- Vinod!

1316
01:42:55,100 --> 01:42:59,161
Hello Vinod.. Yes hello.

1317
01:42:59,305 --> 01:43:00,363
Just a minute,
I am not getting a signal!

1318
01:43:00,439 --> 01:43:02,100
I will go inside. Hello.

1319
01:43:02,441 --> 01:43:04,102
Yes, better now.

1320
01:43:04,376 --> 01:43:05,434
So, how was our flight?

1321
01:43:06,445 --> 01:43:08,106
It was so delayed.

1322
01:43:08,847 --> 01:43:10,109
So what time did you land then?

1323
01:43:10,849 --> 01:43:11,907
Yes!

1324
01:43:11,984 --> 01:43:13,383
How can we come to America?

1325
01:43:13,452 --> 01:43:14,783
He doesn't want to go to America.

1326
01:43:15,054 --> 01:43:16,783
No, no it is just a desire for us.

1327
01:43:16,989 --> 01:43:18,456
Yes! So..

1328
01:43:19,325 --> 01:43:21,452
Did Shweta and
Ishaan come along or not?

1329
01:43:23,329 --> 01:43:24,853
Very good, so when are you coming here?

1330
01:44:08,907 --> 01:44:10,932
Hello sir, how are you?

1331
01:44:13,044 --> 01:44:14,170
Come in, sir.. Have a seat..

1332
01:44:15,313 --> 01:44:16,371
Such a big man like you walking..

1333
01:44:16,448 --> 01:44:18,507
..the streets. It doesn't suit you, sir!

1334
01:44:18,917 --> 01:44:19,975
Come..

1335
01:44:21,353 --> 01:44:22,411
Come on.

1336
01:44:32,397 --> 01:44:33,455
Drive!

1337
01:44:41,539 --> 01:44:43,871
We are very fortunate
to be rubbing shoulders..

1338
01:44:43,942 --> 01:44:45,000
..with his eminence.

1339
01:44:45,343 --> 01:44:46,401
Who is he?

1340
01:44:47,946 --> 01:44:50,574
I don't know his name but
he is a very big man.

1341
01:44:53,284 --> 01:44:55,047
Sir, do you know what his name is?

1342
01:44:56,888 --> 01:44:58,048
Aadam Sheikh.

1343
01:45:01,092 --> 01:45:02,616
These people must really anger you.

1344
01:45:04,129 --> 01:45:06,256
If I were in your shoes,
I would've shot him.

1345
01:45:08,166 --> 01:45:10,634
The problem is that
I am not in your shoes.

1346
01:45:11,970 --> 01:45:13,961
Actually, I don't want
to be in your shoes.

1347
01:45:17,909 --> 01:45:20,343
Sawant, tell me something.

1348
01:45:21,312 --> 01:45:24,907
Suppose, you are on
a night shift and you spot..

1349
01:45:24,983 --> 01:45:30,046
..a man doing something wrong
and you stop him.

1350
01:45:30,989 --> 01:45:33,355
Now the man doesn't like it one bit!

1351
01:45:34,325 --> 01:45:36,919
He doesn't care that
you are a policeman.

1352
01:45:36,995 --> 01:45:38,986
..or that you are just doing your duty!

1353
01:45:39,631 --> 01:45:44,000
Instead he gets angry and
pushes you to the ground.

1354
01:45:44,436 --> 01:45:45,494
So?

1355
01:45:46,004 --> 01:45:47,266
So what will you do to him?
Tell me?

1356
01:45:47,672 --> 01:45:51,438
I'll beat him up all night
and break his bones.

1357
01:45:52,010 --> 01:45:54,604
It'll be difficult to distinguish
his femur from his skull.

1358
01:45:57,015 --> 01:45:58,482
That's our usual treatment..

1359
01:45:58,550 --> 01:45:59,608
Tell me something..
something different.

1360
01:46:00,185 --> 01:46:01,243
Different? Meaning?

1361
01:46:01,953 --> 01:46:06,287
Let's say, we didn't push him back.

1362
01:46:06,691 --> 01:46:09,023
Suppose we spare him.
- So?

1363
01:46:11,696 --> 01:46:17,100
This long-standing practice of
pushing each other will stop.

1364
01:46:17,602 --> 01:46:20,127
Yes.
- You didn't understand.

1365
01:46:21,039 --> 01:46:24,099
This is Aadam Sheikh, a Muslim.

1366
01:46:24,576 --> 01:46:26,066
And I am a Hindu,
Tukaram Patil.

1367
01:46:26,711 --> 01:46:31,705
Now suppose I push him.
And he pushes me back.

1368
01:46:32,450 --> 01:46:34,714
Then one Hindu stands by
my side in support.

1369
01:46:34,986 --> 01:46:37,045
And two Muslims stand by his side.

1370
01:46:37,188 --> 01:46:39,281
Four Hindus appear here,
eight Muslims there!

1371
01:46:39,357 --> 01:46:40,415
Hindus versus Muslims!

1372
01:46:40,492 --> 01:46:42,460
Everyone pushing each other.

1373
01:46:43,528 --> 01:46:44,586
It never stops.

1374
01:46:47,065 --> 01:46:48,123
It starts when you are young..

1375
01:46:48,199 --> 01:46:52,067
..and doesn't stop even
when you get old. Right?

1376
01:46:57,542 --> 01:47:00,170
I have grown old but I'm still
being pushed around.

1377
01:47:03,147 --> 01:47:04,614
I will retire soon.

1378
01:47:06,751 --> 01:47:11,017
But will you young men
think of finding a solution..

1379
01:47:11,089 --> 01:47:13,148
..for this game before you grow old?

1380
01:47:14,025 --> 01:47:15,083
Yes, of course.

1381
01:47:18,096 --> 01:47:19,188
Right?

1382
01:47:24,168 --> 01:47:25,601
Sir, what do you think?

1383
01:47:31,776 --> 01:47:33,038
Hey, we have wasted a lot..

1384
01:47:33,111 --> 01:47:35,170
..of the great man's time. Sorry sir!

1385
01:47:35,246 --> 01:47:36,304
Hey, stop the van!

1386
01:47:41,786 --> 01:47:43,117
Go. Goodnight, sir!

1387
01:47:51,062 --> 01:47:54,156
I am due to retire but our Kadam sir..

1388
01:47:55,466 --> 01:47:58,128
..will keep in touch with you.

1389
01:47:59,170 --> 01:48:01,798
Good night! Go.

1390
01:48:25,530 --> 01:48:28,590
Sorry uncle, we won't
do it again. We swear.

1391
01:48:28,700 --> 01:48:29,758
Please give us the ball.

1392
01:48:29,834 --> 01:48:34,168
Don't play cricket.
It's a colonial game.

1393
01:48:34,839 --> 01:48:39,503
Their cricket has brought
this ball on him.

1394
01:48:40,111 --> 01:48:41,169
Do you know what this is?

1395
01:48:43,114 --> 01:48:45,105
In the Mahabharat,
at Kurukshetra..

1396
01:48:45,183 --> 01:48:51,554
..Lord Krishna recited
the Gita to Arjun.

1397
01:48:52,657 --> 01:48:59,119
Lord Krishna says when morality is..

1398
01:48:59,197 --> 01:49:07,434
..in danger I take birth to destroy evil.

1399
01:49:07,839 --> 01:49:12,139
This 1 0,000 year..

1400
01:49:12,210 --> 01:49:17,614
..old knowledge is the gift of India.

1401
01:49:17,782 --> 01:49:20,649
Do you know how large
India was at that time?

1402
01:49:20,818 --> 01:49:24,151
Sri Lanka, Bangladesh,
Brahmadesh, Bhutan..

1403
01:49:24,222 --> 01:49:28,158
..Nepal, Pakistan,
Afghanistan were all..

1404
01:49:28,226 --> 01:49:31,218
..a part of ancient India.

1405
01:49:31,295 --> 01:49:35,391
It was all snatched away
and we did nothing.

1406
01:49:35,466 --> 01:49:37,229
But we're not cowards!

1407
01:49:38,803 --> 01:49:42,899
'Let's say, we didn't push him back.'

1408
01:49:43,174 --> 01:49:46,166
'Suppose we spare him.
'This long-standing..

1409
01:49:46,244 --> 01:49:49,805
..practice of pushing each
other will stop. - No.'

1410
01:49:50,348 --> 01:49:53,715
'You know what the biggest lie is?'

1411
01:49:53,918 --> 01:49:56,250
'That all religions are equal!'

1412
01:49:56,554 --> 01:50:01,253
'And everyone can live together.'

1413
01:50:02,360 --> 01:50:04,487
'Then one Hindu stands by
my side in support.'

1414
01:50:04,929 --> 01:50:06,760
'And two Muslims stand by his side.'

1415
01:50:06,931 --> 01:50:09,263
'4 Hindus appear here,
8 Muslims there!'

1416
01:50:09,333 --> 01:50:10,391
'Hindus versus Muslims!'

1417
01:50:10,468 --> 01:50:12,368
'Everyone pushing each other.'

1418
01:50:13,838 --> 01:50:16,204
'It starts when you are young
and doesn't stop..

1419
01:50:16,274 --> 01:50:17,332
..even when you get old.'

1420
01:50:18,676 --> 01:50:22,407
'Think of doing something different!'

1421
01:51:55,373 --> 01:51:56,567
We will observe until evening!

1422
01:51:57,308 --> 01:51:58,366
If everything is fine by the evening..

1423
01:51:58,442 --> 01:52:00,376
..then we will discharge him!
- Okay. - Okay?

1424
01:52:00,444 --> 01:52:02,537
What happened?
- Nothing! Come in.

1425
01:52:03,481 --> 01:52:04,675
Take care.
- Okay.

1426
01:52:05,650 --> 01:52:07,311
What did he say?
- Everything is fine.

1427
01:52:07,385 --> 01:52:08,443
There is nothing to worry about!

1428
01:52:08,519 --> 01:52:09,884
He will be discharged by evening.

1429
01:52:11,589 --> 01:52:14,717
By tickling my ears,
you will get better numbers.

1430
01:52:19,330 --> 01:52:23,960
Rupali Joshi, one of the youngest
and best T.V reporters.

1431
01:52:24,669 --> 01:52:26,330
You must have seen Rupali presenting..

1432
01:52:26,404 --> 01:52:28,838
..many amazing T.V news.

1433
01:52:29,440 --> 01:52:31,340
Rupali presented her best T.V report..

1434
01:52:31,409 --> 01:52:33,343
..when on the 26th of July..
- Mohit!

1435
01:52:33,411 --> 01:52:37,404
Rain wrecked havoc on
the metropolitan city of Mumbai.

1436
01:52:37,882 --> 01:52:39,349
Rupali bravely stood in the rain..

1437
01:52:39,417 --> 01:52:42,750
..and carried out her duty as a reporter.

1438
01:52:43,087 --> 01:52:45,351
And look, after a year there
are tears trickling down..

1439
01:52:45,423 --> 01:52:50,759
..Rupali's eyes. Presenting Rupali.
- The Unwed Widow!

1440
01:52:51,362 --> 01:52:52,420
But how?

1441
01:52:53,364 --> 01:52:55,628
On one side, reaching
new heights in her career, Rupali.

1442
01:52:55,900 --> 01:52:58,596
And on the other hand,
rising industrialist, Ajay Kumar.

1443
01:52:59,370 --> 01:53:01,634
Both loved each other a lot.

1444
01:53:01,873 --> 01:53:04,364
A wedding was planned
just two months later..

1445
01:53:04,442 --> 01:53:07,377
..on the second of October,
the birth anniversary..

1446
01:53:07,445 --> 01:53:10,573
..of the Father of the Nation,
Mahatma Gandhi.

1447
01:53:10,681 --> 01:53:12,876
Their engagement was very grand.

1448
01:53:13,384 --> 01:53:16,046
Beautiful wedding cards
were printed too.

1449
01:53:16,387 --> 01:53:18,378
On the morning of 1 1th July..

1450
01:53:18,456 --> 01:53:21,948
..they met, sharing a dreamy
breakfast with love.

1451
01:53:22,026 --> 01:53:24,392
But by the evening of
1 1th July, their dreams..

1452
01:53:24,462 --> 01:53:26,794
..plunged forever into darkness..

1453
01:53:29,533 --> 01:53:32,400
..when seven deadly blasts in
the Mumbai local trains..

1454
01:53:32,470 --> 01:53:34,768
..within eleven minutes.

1455
01:53:34,839 --> 01:53:38,400
As usual, Rupali was bravely reporting..

1456
01:53:38,476 --> 01:53:42,412
..from the blast site not
knowing that one of the..

1457
01:53:42,480 --> 01:53:46,780
..corpses around her
was of her husband, Ajay.

1458
01:53:47,418 --> 01:53:50,819
How did Ajay and Rupali
meet the first time!

1459
01:53:51,422 --> 01:53:52,480
We will see in a while.

1460
01:53:52,957 --> 01:53:54,481
What do you think?

1461
01:53:54,725 --> 01:53:57,421
After this terrible incident
that has occurred with her..

1462
01:53:57,495 --> 01:54:00,430
..will she be able to carry
out her role as the reporter..

1463
01:54:00,498 --> 01:54:01,556
..in the same manner, or not?

1464
01:54:01,933 --> 01:54:07,428
If your answer is a 'Yes',
Type Y RBR and if..

1465
01:54:07,505 --> 01:54:13,501
..your answer is a 'No' type
N RBR and SMS to 7776.

1466
01:54:13,711 --> 01:54:16,111
Don't forget to write your
name with your answer.

1467
01:54:16,514 --> 01:54:18,448
Keep watching only on T.V news.

1468
01:54:18,516 --> 01:54:20,006
Rupali-The Unwed Widow!

1469
01:54:46,477 --> 01:54:47,535
This is our kitchen.

1470
01:54:47,611 --> 01:54:50,011
Yes. - I want an identical kitchen, Nikhil.

1471
01:54:50,081 --> 01:54:51,810
Let's go then.
- Where to?

1472
01:54:52,149 --> 01:54:55,550
America! - America?
Hey that's great!

1473
01:54:56,754 --> 01:54:58,483
If you are really planning to come..

1474
01:54:58,556 --> 01:55:00,615
..Let me know so
I can apply for my leave.

1475
01:55:01,492 --> 01:55:03,983
Really! You must come there.

1476
01:55:04,228 --> 01:55:07,891
I promise, once you come there,
you will stay forever.

1477
01:55:08,566 --> 01:55:11,160
Oh! If only you had planned
this a little earlier.

1478
01:55:11,235 --> 01:55:12,634
Your delivery would
have been done there.

1479
01:55:13,504 --> 01:55:14,562
Just like Ishan,
your child would have been..

1480
01:55:14,638 --> 01:55:16,071
..an American citizen.

1481
01:55:16,574 --> 01:55:18,804
You mean, I will have to travel
to America to see my grandchild?

1482
01:55:20,578 --> 01:55:22,569
But I have rheumatic knees.

1483
01:55:22,780 --> 01:55:24,611
You don't have to walk to America.

1484
01:55:30,588 --> 01:55:31,646
Remember those days, Nikhil.

1485
01:55:31,756 --> 01:55:34,589
Of ticket less travels in the city bus.

1486
01:55:35,159 --> 01:55:36,524
And we were caught one day!

1487
01:55:36,594 --> 01:55:37,652
I do remember.

1488
01:55:37,995 --> 01:55:40,520
The local tea joint, the argument
of the neighbors..

1489
01:55:40,598 --> 01:55:43,897
..the Sunday afternoon cricket match.

1490
01:55:45,202 --> 01:55:46,260
I miss that!

1491
01:55:47,271 --> 01:55:50,604
Okay, now come on give me
a dance pose. Oh, lovely.

1492
01:55:50,674 --> 01:55:52,642
Anyways, everything
has changed here.

1493
01:55:52,777 --> 01:55:56,008
You know, these terrorists
and bomb blasts.

1494
01:55:56,614 --> 01:55:59,549
There are no guarantees
that a man who steps out..

1495
01:55:59,617 --> 01:56:03,053
..in the morning will return
safe and sound.

1496
01:56:03,654 --> 01:56:05,622
Which place in the world holds
such a guarantee, Nikhil?

1497
01:56:06,190 --> 01:56:09,626
Vinod, are you.. are you happy
with your life there?

1498
01:56:11,629 --> 01:56:12,687
I am good.

1499
01:56:13,297 --> 01:56:14,730
What more do you want from life?

1500
01:56:15,232 --> 01:56:18,633
My childhood ambition
was to go to America.

1501
01:56:19,303 --> 01:56:22,670
A big house, a big car,
a good lifestyle.

1502
01:56:23,240 --> 01:56:24,298
A healthy lifestyle.

1503
01:56:25,643 --> 01:56:26,905
I seem to have everything.

1504
01:56:29,313 --> 01:56:33,147
I work on Wall Street, the most
expensive street in the world.

1505
01:56:33,717 --> 01:56:36,652
After all, I live on paradise on earth.

1506
01:56:40,958 --> 01:56:42,687
But times are changing, Nikhil.

1507
01:56:43,260 --> 01:56:46,661
Two small planes shook the entire
country down to their roots.

1508
01:56:47,598 --> 01:56:48,656
Superpower!

1509
01:56:52,870 --> 01:56:54,599
The greatest security on the planet..

1510
01:56:54,672 --> 01:56:55,730
..could not protect the twin towers.

1511
01:56:57,174 --> 01:56:59,665
Previously tourists came
for the Twin Towers.

1512
01:57:00,244 --> 01:57:01,939
Now, they visit Ground Zero.

1513
01:57:13,157 --> 01:57:15,682
Every today you can see
someone crying there.

1514
01:57:15,860 --> 01:57:18,351
Even today, you see an
old woman carrying a wreath!

1515
01:57:24,702 --> 01:57:26,636
I think the next generation
will get used to all this..

1516
01:57:26,704 --> 01:57:30,697
..violence, bomb blasts.. bloodshed.

1517
01:57:31,142 --> 01:57:33,303
They will be used to
it since their childhood.

1518
01:57:33,377 --> 01:57:35,641
I think some children must
have heard about it..

1519
01:57:35,713 --> 01:57:37,305
..from their mother's womb.

1520
01:57:39,016 --> 01:57:40,313
It's never-ending Nikhil!

1521
01:58:05,843 --> 01:58:09,677
512 MB Ram, 80 GB hard disk,
keyboards, monitors..

1522
01:58:09,747 --> 01:58:12,113
..you will get everything original.

1523
01:58:12,683 --> 01:58:16,244
Hardware is fine but how
much for the software?

1524
01:58:17,421 --> 01:58:19,753
Nothing. It's for free.
I have it right here.

1525
01:58:20,791 --> 01:58:23,885
The Americans are rich
enough without our money..

1526
01:58:27,431 --> 01:58:31,424
But Suresh, all this should
be done in two days.

1527
01:58:31,702 --> 01:58:33,192
It will be done.
- Sure?

1528
01:58:33,270 --> 01:58:34,328
Sure!

1529
01:58:40,711 --> 01:58:41,769
Do you take cash?

1530
01:58:44,715 --> 01:58:45,773
Yes, of course.

1531
01:58:51,055 --> 01:58:53,785
Brother Feroze, I had told you
about it yesterday. - Yes.

1532
01:58:54,725 --> 01:58:56,192
Let's complete that
within two days too.

1533
01:58:56,794 --> 01:58:58,785
We will fix a meeting
whenever you say.

1534
01:58:59,063 --> 01:59:01,793
Call him on lunch tomorrow,
we will settle the matter there.

1535
01:59:03,867 --> 01:59:04,925
Our dear companion..

1536
01:59:05,169 --> 01:59:08,866
..Tukaram Patil retires from
active police duty today.

1537
01:59:09,740 --> 01:59:11,731
For the past 36 years,
he has served the department..

1538
01:59:11,809 --> 01:59:13,834
..at different police stations across the city.

1539
01:59:14,945 --> 01:59:16,810
Today is his last day of duty.

1540
01:59:17,748 --> 01:59:19,739
The ever-smiling Mr. Patil..

1541
01:59:19,817 --> 01:59:21,751
..has lowered the tension of..

1542
01:59:21,819 --> 01:59:23,116
..the people of the department.

1543
01:59:24,755 --> 01:59:26,746
Mr. Patil, your jokes and
humorous anecdotes..

1544
01:59:26,824 --> 01:59:28,451
..shall always be remembered.

1545
01:59:29,059 --> 01:59:30,754
On behalf of the Police Commissioner..

1546
01:59:30,828 --> 01:59:32,762
..senior officers and
the entire department.

1547
01:59:32,830 --> 01:59:34,161
I offer gratitude to Mr. Patil.

1548
01:59:36,200 --> 01:59:38,760
I also urge him to accept
this gift as a small token..

1549
01:59:38,836 --> 01:59:41,168
..of our gratitude and appreciation.

1550
01:59:51,415 --> 01:59:53,849
Hello, papa?
-Sejal is in labour.

1551
01:59:53,951 --> 01:59:55,942
We are taking her to Sanjivini Hospital.

1552
01:59:56,120 --> 01:59:59,089
You get there quickly.
- I'm coming..

1553
01:59:59,156 --> 02:00:02,182
Take Mr. Bhosle from
the first floor along with you..

1554
02:00:02,259 --> 02:00:04,124
Yes, yes, everyone is here.
You just come fast.

1555
02:00:04,194 --> 02:00:05,252
I am on my way..

1556
02:00:27,551 --> 02:00:29,075
I have to go to Andheri.

1557
02:00:29,153 --> 02:00:30,814
No sir, not there.

1558
02:00:30,888 --> 02:00:32,480
Please, it is very urgent.

1559
02:00:32,823 --> 02:00:34,882
No sir, there is too much traffic there.

1560
02:00:35,359 --> 02:00:36,826
My wife has been taken
to the hospital..

1561
02:00:36,894 --> 02:00:37,952
..she is going to have a baby.

1562
02:00:38,028 --> 02:00:39,461
It's necessary for me to go there.

1563
02:00:39,563 --> 02:00:41,997
Ok then. But it will take
at least an hour and half. - Yes.

1564
02:00:43,033 --> 02:00:44,091
An hour and half!

1565
02:00:44,168 --> 02:00:47,069
Why don't you take the train?
You will reach in just 20 minutes.

1566
02:00:55,578 --> 02:00:56,840
This is sir's money.

1567
02:00:57,013 --> 02:00:59,846
Come on, take it.

1568
02:01:03,019 --> 02:01:07,080
Listen. And this is for you.
- No!

1569
02:01:07,156 --> 02:01:09,886
Keep it, boy! Enjoy yourself!
- Thank you.

1570
02:01:13,596 --> 02:01:14,858
He gave this to me.

1571
02:01:15,932 --> 02:01:16,990
And a tea..

1572
02:01:17,867 --> 02:01:19,528
Brother Musa, how are you?

1573
02:01:19,602 --> 02:01:21,866
Yusuf.. how are you? - Good.
-Business seems to be good.

1574
02:01:33,950 --> 02:01:36,885
Now our beloved Mr. Patil
will say a few words.

1575
02:01:38,354 --> 02:01:39,878
No. No.
- Come on, speak up.

1576
02:01:40,557 --> 02:01:42,616
Patil sir, speak.

1577
02:01:46,329 --> 02:01:47,387
Speak!

1578
02:01:51,067 --> 02:01:54,969
I'm a small man from
a small village.

1579
02:01:56,472 --> 02:01:59,635
I was born in 1948.

1580
02:02:01,177 --> 02:02:05,910
My father would say,
Tukya I wanted to carry you..

1581
02:02:05,982 --> 02:02:07,916
..to the Red Fort in Delhi for..

1582
02:02:07,984 --> 02:02:11,010
..the celebration of independence..

1583
02:02:12,155 --> 02:02:16,057
But you fool,
you were born a year late.

1584
02:02:18,294 --> 02:02:21,457
I would say, father that's your fault.

1585
02:02:25,668 --> 02:02:29,536
My parents were illiterate.

1586
02:02:30,440 --> 02:02:33,932
But they sent me to school so I could..

1587
02:02:34,010 --> 02:02:40,415
..read and write. Well, I learnt
only how to read and write.

1588
02:02:43,519 --> 02:02:44,952
Today is my day of retirement so I shall..

1589
02:02:45,021 --> 02:02:46,079
..make a small confession..

1590
02:02:46,956 --> 02:02:51,689
I stole my teacher's spectacles.

1591
02:02:54,998 --> 02:02:56,488
I was thrown out of the school.

1592
02:02:57,567 --> 02:03:01,469
I don't know why, I always
had a fascination for specs.

1593
02:03:02,672 --> 02:03:03,969
As a child I felt that spectacles..

1594
02:03:04,040 --> 02:03:06,975
..allowed a man to see things far away.

1595
02:03:08,111 --> 02:03:09,169
When I finally got my glasses..

1596
02:03:09,245 --> 02:03:10,303
..I realized that far-2ightedness..

1597
02:03:10,380 --> 02:03:13,975
..was a virtue that required
a different perspective..

1598
02:03:14,050 --> 02:03:15,449
..which I was not capable of..

1599
02:03:17,020 --> 02:03:18,988
When they threw me out of school..

1600
02:03:19,055 --> 02:03:21,319
..my father said,
Tukya, you are a thief!

1601
02:03:21,724 --> 02:03:23,988
And when you grow up,
you shall become a bigger thief!

1602
02:03:25,395 --> 02:03:27,989
So when he heard that
the police force was recruiting..

1603
02:03:28,064 --> 02:03:32,000
..he said, Tukya, get out of here,
join the police force.

1604
02:03:34,270 --> 02:03:35,328
Around the same time..

1605
02:03:35,405 --> 02:03:38,397
..the mill where my father
worked went on strike.

1606
02:03:39,742 --> 02:03:41,004
It never ended.

1607
02:03:43,112 --> 02:03:47,014
Relying on the words
of the union leader..

1608
02:03:47,083 --> 02:03:48,607
..my father died!

1609
02:03:55,591 --> 02:03:58,025
He died and the mill got sold.

1610
02:03:58,628 --> 02:04:02,587
Today, a big, posh mall
stands in its place.

1611
02:04:04,767 --> 02:04:09,033
But whenever I see
a poor man in that mall..

1612
02:04:09,672 --> 02:04:13,073
I feel the strike and
the strife never ended for him..

1613
02:04:15,778 --> 02:04:17,177
Today my wife says to me..

1614
02:04:19,215 --> 02:04:22,048
..you've been serving
the police force for 36 years.

1615
02:04:23,052 --> 02:04:26,044
Today, when you retire,
ask your boss to show..

1616
02:04:26,122 --> 02:04:28,682
..your interview on the T.V.

1617
02:04:30,460 --> 02:04:31,518
why?

1618
02:04:31,594 --> 02:04:34,222
She says, these days they
interview anyone on the TV.

1619
02:04:34,330 --> 02:04:35,388
So what's wrong with you?

1620
02:04:36,265 --> 02:04:42,067
I said, no dear,
I don't want publicity.

1621
02:04:43,139 --> 02:04:44,697
I only want to do my duty.
That's all!

1622
02:04:47,543 --> 02:04:50,068
These days,
the trains are so crowded!

1623
02:04:53,316 --> 02:04:56,080
I suddenly realized it only today.

1624
02:04:57,220 --> 02:05:01,350
In the old days, the local
trains were never so crowded.

1625
02:05:03,726 --> 02:05:07,093
The younger generation
would never believe that..

1626
02:05:07,163 --> 02:05:09,290
..Mumbai was a clean and quiet city.

1627
02:05:11,167 --> 02:05:13,101
The city had no tensions.
My wife and I used to..

1628
02:05:13,169 --> 02:05:16,798
..regularly go to the airport
for our evening stroll.

1629
02:05:17,707 --> 02:05:19,834
And I've seen a plane
from such a close distance.

1630
02:05:20,543 --> 02:05:25,640
Yes, close enough to touch!
No need for security.

1631
02:05:25,715 --> 02:05:27,740
No checks. No fear.

1632
02:05:28,117 --> 02:05:33,111
No Hindu-Muslim riots or
communal tension. Nothing!

1633
02:05:35,625 --> 02:05:37,115
Children used to happily
enjoy fire crackers..

1634
02:05:37,193 --> 02:05:38,785
..during the festival of light.

1635
02:05:40,863 --> 02:05:46,199
Wonder who renamed these
crackers as atom bombs?

1636
02:05:52,775 --> 02:05:55,209
Do you know how
Mumbai came into existence?

1637
02:05:56,279 --> 02:05:59,874
There were seven smaller pieces of land.

1638
02:06:01,150 --> 02:06:04,586
They were brought together
and Mumbai was born.

1639
02:06:08,157 --> 02:06:10,148
The day when seven bombs exploded..

1640
02:06:10,226 --> 02:06:13,161
..in the trains,
I wondered, will it shatter..

1641
02:06:13,229 --> 02:06:17,757
..and divide Mumbai in seven parts again?

1642
02:06:23,739 --> 02:06:25,798
I looked into the mirror and said..

1643
02:06:25,908 --> 02:06:27,170
Tukya..

1644
02:06:28,177 --> 02:06:29,769
..you have become a philosophizing poet.

1645
02:06:31,180 --> 02:06:32,613
And that too in a police uniform.

1646
02:06:40,623 --> 02:06:44,719
I won't be wearing this uniform tomorrow.

1647
02:06:49,532 --> 02:06:50,931
I won't come to work either.

1648
02:06:56,606 --> 02:07:01,202
But I'll pray to God that in my next birth..

1649
02:07:01,277 --> 02:07:06,214
..if He decides to make me
a policeman again..

1650
02:07:11,754 --> 02:07:17,215
..I will dedicate my life
with complete integrity..

1651
02:07:17,293 --> 02:07:19,420
..to something real good.

1652
02:07:23,966 --> 02:07:28,232
There's some problem.. And I will
also pray that we are successful..

1653
02:07:28,304 --> 02:07:33,264
..in nabbing the ones responsible
for the bomb blasts.

1654
02:07:43,519 --> 02:07:46,784
I shall conclude here lest
I break out into tears.

1655
02:07:47,857 --> 02:07:49,256
And crying in a police
uniform is not allowed..

1656
02:07:49,325 --> 02:07:51,987
..so I think I need to go to the toilet.

1657
02:08:02,939 --> 02:08:07,273
So, Kadam?
I was just telling the boss..

1658
02:08:07,343 --> 02:08:10,369
..to end your suspension soon.

1659
02:08:11,013 --> 02:08:12,275
I told him that you are a good man..

1660
02:08:12,348 --> 02:08:14,282
..and even good people make mistakes..

1661
02:08:14,350 --> 02:08:15,476
He said he'll look into it.

1662
02:08:15,685 --> 02:08:19,348
Patil sir! Patil sir! Patil sir! Patil sir!

1663
02:08:22,291 --> 02:08:23,690
Forgive me!

1664
02:08:26,028 --> 02:08:27,893
Forgive me..

1665
02:08:33,469 --> 02:08:35,027
Can you pass me
the match box, please!

1666
02:08:45,381 --> 02:08:47,349
Will you have tea? Guddu!

1667
02:08:48,317 --> 02:08:49,375
Two cups of special tea!

1668
02:08:49,485 --> 02:08:50,543
I.. I don't want tea.

1669
02:08:51,721 --> 02:08:53,018
Now that I've ordered it, have some.

1670
02:09:10,339 --> 02:09:12,432
Oshiwara?
- No. - Come on.

1671
02:09:15,845 --> 02:09:17,779
Rickshaw.. Rickshaw..

1672
02:09:18,080 --> 02:09:21,015
Give me a rose.. Quick!
- Rs.5!

1673
02:09:21,617 --> 02:09:22,675
Taxi..

1674
02:09:24,954 --> 02:09:26,012
Taxi..

1675
02:09:29,959 --> 02:09:31,017
Rickshaw..

1676
02:09:33,529 --> 02:09:34,587
Come on!

1677
02:09:54,116 --> 02:09:55,378
Nice song!

1678
02:09:57,920 --> 02:09:58,978
Aamir Khan has performed so well.

1679
02:09:59,055 --> 02:10:00,955
"The mud of my country..

1680
02:10:02,124 --> 02:10:07,562
"The mud of my country..

1681
02:10:07,797 --> 02:10:08,991
Do you have faith in Sai Baba?

1682
02:10:09,398 --> 02:10:11,992
..is so fragrant."

1683
02:10:12,535 --> 02:10:13,593
Yes.

1684
02:10:23,479 --> 02:10:24,537
These are Baba's holy offerings.

1685
02:10:27,049 --> 02:10:28,983
I was in Shirdi,
these past few days.

1686
02:10:29,718 --> 02:10:31,413
When Baba's call knocks
at my heart, I have to go.

1687
02:10:33,155 --> 02:10:36,488
Here is a photo of Baba with
a calendar at the back.

1688
02:10:37,493 --> 02:10:38,653
Keep these offerings and have faith.

1689
02:10:42,998 --> 02:10:44,056
Thank you.

1690
02:10:49,438 --> 02:10:50,496
Taxi..

1691
02:10:52,007 --> 02:10:53,065
Let's go to that side.

1692
02:10:54,643 --> 02:10:57,168
Let's wait for some time,
then we will go. - Yes, fine.

1693
02:11:00,449 --> 02:11:01,711
Stop. Stop here.

1694
02:11:03,786 --> 02:11:08,450
Here.. your.. your taxi!

1695
02:11:15,564 --> 02:11:16,622
Carefully!

1696
02:11:23,539 --> 02:11:24,597
Oshiwara!

1697
02:11:57,506 --> 02:11:58,564
I deal in computers!

1698
02:11:59,241 --> 02:12:00,640
Business is down these days.

1699
02:12:01,844 --> 02:12:03,243
I have received a few orders,
let's see what happens.

1700
02:12:04,780 --> 02:12:05,838
What do you do?

1701
02:12:06,515 --> 02:12:07,573
I have an A/C..

1702
02:12:07,917 --> 02:12:09,509
Sit here.
- Hey Manya, come.

1703
02:12:10,920 --> 02:12:13,013
Yusuf, this is Manya.
- Hi. - Hi.

1704
02:12:13,589 --> 02:12:14,783
We lovingly call him fool!

1705
02:12:16,258 --> 02:12:17,520
Why?

1706
02:12:46,622 --> 02:12:47,680
This is Ashok.

1707
02:12:48,023 --> 02:12:49,547
How are you?
- Fine.

1708
02:12:49,625 --> 02:12:51,092
And this is Jhandu.
- Hi.

1709
02:12:51,227 --> 02:12:52,956
How are you? Come,
come, sit down. - Thanks.

1710
02:12:54,930 --> 02:12:58,991
Move.. See his size!
- Shut up!

1711
02:13:18,320 --> 02:13:20,049
Hey guys, I just received
a new sound clip.

1712
02:13:20,122 --> 02:13:23,580
It is hilarious!
You will laugh to death! Come.

1713
02:13:29,331 --> 02:13:32,323
I will take the bikes!
Let this get down first! Okay.

1714
02:13:51,954 --> 02:13:53,615
I still remember that sound clip..

1715
02:13:53,689 --> 02:13:54,747
..the one with Sunny Deol's voice.

1716
02:13:54,823 --> 02:13:57,053
Hey guys, stand up!
- Why?! What happened?

1717
02:13:57,726 --> 02:13:59,057
Don't you remember?
See the time.

1718
02:14:16,111 --> 02:14:19,706
What is happening?
Why has the train stopped suddenly?

1719
02:14:19,882 --> 02:14:20,940
Did something happen again?

1720
02:14:21,383 --> 02:14:22,645
It's nothing.
Last week at this time..

1721
02:14:22,718 --> 02:14:24,845
..the bomb blasts took place..

1722
02:14:25,654 --> 02:14:26,712
