4
00:01:11,791 --> 00:01:13,691

Accordingly to this will...
Raja's father-in-law,

Your one sorry is worth
Rs.750 crores.

20
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:08,938
The fault is not with law,
it's with you.

21
00:02:09,749 --> 00:02:12,718
Because l wanted
to win this case.

22
00:02:13,219 --> 00:02:14,777
But you wanted to make a
living out of this case.

23
00:02:15,221 --> 00:02:15,949
That's the difference.

24
00:02:16,122 --> 00:02:16,713
That isn't sir...

25
00:02:18,124 --> 00:02:19,113
You were a street lawyer
without a office,

26
00:02:19,358 --> 00:02:20,757
l made you go to
the supreme court.

27
00:02:21,127 --> 00:02:23,618
ln 20 years you've built

28
00:02:29,035 --> 00:02:30,332
...21 years old girl!

29
00:02:31,037 --> 00:02:33,005
Princess of Mirzapur

30
00:02:33,473 --> 00:02:35,373
When all others are giving
flower bouquets on her birthday.

00:02:35,808 --> 00:02:38,003
l've to present her with
crores of worth property.

l will...l will
definetely give.

33
00:02:42,482 --> 00:02:44,347
But she'll not be
alive to receive it.

34
00:02:46,285 --> 00:02:49,015
Before she lights the 21st
candle of her birthday,

35
00:02:49,489 --> 00:02:51,184
l'll kill her.

36
00:03:02,001 --> 00:03:03,730
l'm going to kill Maleeshwari.

37
00:04:08,901 --> 00:04:09,526
madam

38
00:04:10,469 --> 00:04:11,436
Grandpa is calling you.

39
00:04:46,973 --> 00:04:47,598
No one has seen it.

40
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,105
Broken a pot again?
You'll never reform.

41
00:04:56,315 --> 00:04:57,282
Lakshmi, wait.

42
00:04:58,217 --> 00:05:00,185
l'm asking you, tell me the truth
-what?

43
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:03,049
The matter about of breaking a pot,
only l and the pot know.

44
00:05:03,322 --> 00:05:06,120
Neither there's a piece of plant
or mark on the bumper,

45
00:05:06,359 --> 00:05:07,291
How did you find then?

46
00:05:07,526 --> 00:05:08,424
Pot is missing from there.

47
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,327
Coming sir

48
00:05:15,534 --> 00:05:17,001

00:05:24,377 --> 00:05:26,345
Why are you shivering sir?
-cold.

50
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:28,106
lf you feel so cold
can't you switch off the fan?

51
00:05:28,381 --> 00:05:30,246
That's why, l called you.
switch it off.

52
00:05:34,487 --> 00:05:36,045
Find my slippers also.

53
00:05:42,595 --> 00:05:43,493
Give me a cigarette.

54
00:05:49,201 --> 00:05:50,065
Lighter sir?

55
00:05:50,536 --> 00:05:53,835
lt's next to it, l'll take it
-Okay sir.

56
00:05:58,110 --> 00:05:58,633
Take god's offering.

57
00:06:00,112 --> 00:06:01,636
ls your stomach ache okay now?
-No Madam.

58
00:06:01,881 --> 00:06:06,113
Listen to me, fast for 7 Fridays

59
00:06:07,887 --> 00:06:10,754
lf l follow you not only pain
l'll also die.

60
00:06:25,705 --> 00:06:27,570
Good morning grandpa

61
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:30,131
lt seems you called me.
-Me?

62
00:06:31,177 --> 00:06:31,836
Lakshmi told me.

63
00:06:32,411 --> 00:06:33,708
She would've told to
make you get up.

64
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:38,647
ls it same thing for
it's breakfast every day?

65
00:06:39,185 --> 00:06:41,710
Can't you feed idli or
dosa to it?

66
00:06:42,188 --> 00:06:43,655
lf it eats all that,
it can't fly.

67
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:46,248
lt'll sleep till 10 AM like you.
-Grandpa.

68
00:07:44,316 --> 00:07:46,784
Malleeshwari...-what happened?

69
00:07:54,927 --> 00:07:56,861
lt is definitely the handiwork
of Bhavani Shankar, father.

70
00:07:57,363 --> 00:07:59,888
l don't know what
you do, Mr. Lawyer.

71
00:08:00,466 --> 00:08:02,024
l want him in jail
within next 24 hours.

72
00:08:02,802 --> 00:08:05,669
lt is easy to find the gun
that shot this bullet,

73
00:08:05,938 --> 00:08:08,372
But it's very difficult to find
who was the shooter.

74
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:10,672
But one thing l
can say for sure,

75
00:08:11,477 --> 00:08:12,671
They are losing the case

76
00:08:13,145 --> 00:08:16,342
That's why, they are planning
to kill Malleeshwari.

77
00:08:17,383 --> 00:08:19,851
Can't we do anything?

78
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:24,688
We can't do anything till
we get the judgement.

79
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:29,586
What if we send
Maleeshwari out from here?

80
00:08:38,871 --> 00:08:41,066
You know Murthy & family
in Vizag, don't you? -Yes.

81
00:08:42,541 --> 00:08:44,406
You've to stay with
them for few days.

82
00:08:45,678 --> 00:08:46,076
okay?

83
00:08:49,448 --> 00:08:49,971
Grandpa

84
00:08:50,783 --> 00:08:52,842
You'll be sad to leave me dear.

85
00:08:53,686 --> 00:08:56,120
But we are scared of
your safety here.

86
00:08:58,824 --> 00:09:01,918
Nobody will recognize you there
Listen to me.

87
00:09:04,163 --> 00:09:05,130
My sweet little girl.

88
00:09:06,599 --> 00:09:11,627

00:09:19,278 --> 00:09:20,575
Greetings father-in-law.

00:09:20,846 --> 00:09:23,474
Son -in-law, why did
you come urgently?

00:09:23,949 --> 00:09:25,177
Can l come in & tell or
shall l tell here only?

92
00:09:25,618 --> 00:09:28,143
Will it take so much time?
Then, come in & tell.

93
00:09:28,854 --> 00:09:29,479
Thank God

94
00:09:29,755 --> 00:09:31,586
Are you doing fine, dear?
-l'm fine.

95
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:33,587
Where's your daughter?
-She's in school.

96
00:09:33,792 --> 00:09:34,520
Where's mother-in-law?

97
00:09:34,793 --> 00:09:37,626
She went to a movie
with neighbor man.- what?

98
00:09:37,997 --> 00:09:39,191
His wife is also with them.

99
00:09:39,665 --> 00:09:41,860
Welcome in.-come.
please sit down.

100
00:09:43,235 --> 00:09:44,634
What's the news?

101
00:09:45,337 --> 00:09:47,237
l've come to talk about
my brother's marriage.

102
00:09:47,806 --> 00:09:49,205
l've brought the priest also
-Greetings.

103
00:09:49,575 --> 00:09:50,769
Look at his latest photo.

104
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:53,774
l've been seeing from childhood
why to see the photo of Prasad now?

105
00:09:54,813 --> 00:09:55,871
He has put on weight now.

106
00:09:57,917 --> 00:09:58,315
Look father-in-law

107
00:09:59,151 --> 00:10:01,244
You refused to give elder daughter
as she's older to him.

108
00:10:01,687 --> 00:10:02,119
we gave up.

109
00:10:02,588 --> 00:10:05,216
You said you've a proposal from your
wife's side for second daughter.

110
00:10:05,624 --> 00:10:06,215
And said your wife will
beat if you refuse.

111
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:07,114
So, we gave up again.

112
00:10:07,626 --> 00:10:08,786
At least you've to agree to give your
third daughter to him in marriage.

113
00:10:09,061 --> 00:10:11,825
Do you've to stress on it?
what does Varaprasad lack?

114
00:10:12,064 --> 00:10:15,090
Though not handsome, not well educated
or doesn't have much property.

115
00:10:15,301 --> 00:10:16,700
He's a bank employee.

116
00:10:18,971 --> 00:10:20,302
lf you ask your daughter
about her idea...

117
00:10:20,739 --> 00:10:21,831
Let's ask her right now.

118
00:10:22,975 --> 00:10:23,634
Coming dad

119
00:10:23,876 --> 00:10:25,969
Their mother loves all the
legendary chaste women.

120
00:10:26,212 --> 00:10:27,839
That's why she named
all after them

121
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,947
Savithri...Sakkubai
.she's Anasuya.

122
00:10:31,217 --> 00:10:33,651
Elder brother-in-law...
he has got you a marriage proposal.

123
00:10:33,986 --> 00:10:35,385
you know his brother
Varaprasad, don't you?

124
00:10:35,888 --> 00:10:37,321
Tell me your opinion about him.

125
00:10:48,701 --> 00:10:49,224
who is that?
how long do you know him?

126
00:10:49,935 --> 00:10:51,664
You know him for 2 months!

127
00:10:52,037 --> 00:10:53,163
How can your pregnancy
be 3 month old now?

128
00:10:53,706 --> 00:10:54,673
What does he do?

129
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:56,232
Does he have any savings or not?

130
00:10:56,809 --> 00:10:58,834
l don't know father.
- l don't like all this.

131
00:10:59,044 --> 00:11:01,911
l don't mind with many men
you'd affairs before marriage.

132
00:11:02,147 --> 00:11:04,115
But you must marry
only Varaprasad..

133
00:11:04,817 --> 00:11:07,342
because he's a bank employee.
-All Right.

134
00:11:12,992 --> 00:11:14,687
l don't know how to
tell him this, priest.

135
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:16,384
You don't worry.

136
00:11:16,862 --> 00:11:18,352
Everything will fall into it's place
once they're married.

137
00:11:18,864 --> 00:11:19,353
What are you saying?

138
00:11:19,765 --> 00:11:20,891
have you given up
this proposal too?

139
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:23,159
My brother-in-law needs
a girl not a mother

140
00:11:23,335 --> 00:11:25,098
Till now 24 proposals
have gone past.

141
00:11:25,337 --> 00:11:27,965
One more will make
it a silver jubilee.

142
00:11:28,207 --> 00:11:30,107
By the way, is your brother
fated to marry or not.

143
00:11:30,342 --> 00:11:32,970
l don't know about his fate,
but he's mad about marriage.

144
00:11:33,212 --> 00:11:35,976
He used to pester my mother to dress him
like a groom as a little boy.

145
00:11:36,215 --> 00:11:39,082
Hasn't left any temple or any god,
without offering prayers for marriage.

146
00:11:41,353 --> 00:11:51,854
Hail Lord Venkatesha.
Hail Lord tirumala.

147
00:11:52,264 --> 00:11:58,362
Lord of Lords! l'm in ecstasy.

148
00:12:03,842 --> 00:12:15,242
Hail Allah the great!

149
00:12:26,332 --> 00:12:39,973
Hail Lord sai Baba!

150
00:12:47,686 --> 00:12:49,881
Did you know how nice glimpse
l had in temple today?

151
00:12:50,155 --> 00:12:51,918
The coconut split into
exact 2 halves.

152
00:12:52,191 --> 00:12:53,317
Moreover a flower too

153
00:12:54,193 --> 00:12:56,218
That girl had morning sickness.
-True?

154
00:12:56,528 --> 00:12:59,361
Yes, she vomited as soon as
l told her your name.

155
00:13:00,299 --> 00:13:02,631
may be she didn't like my name.
-She loves some one else.

156
00:13:04,303 --> 00:13:06,362
No Problem brother.
This is quite common now.

157
00:13:06,972 --> 00:13:09,167
She's 3 month pregnant.
-Pregnant?

158
00:13:09,408 --> 00:13:10,170
No proud

159
00:13:10,542 --> 00:13:13,272
Sweets we took became offering
for her baby shower ceremony.

160
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:18,446
tears in her eyes and vomits to her.
l'm sick of it.

161
00:13:19,318 --> 00:13:20,945
What shall we do now?
-Let's have lunch.

162
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,278
She has cooked some non-sense.

163
00:13:22,554 --> 00:13:25,489
l'm not asking about now,
l'm asking about me.

164
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:27,986
Why are you anxious as if you'll
never marry in this life?

165
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:31,156
lt seems 60 babies out
of 100 born are girls.

166
00:13:31,363 --> 00:13:35,231
lf you plan properly you can
marry twice.-But when?

167
00:13:35,467 --> 00:13:37,367
Wait! what's so hurry?
-Hurry?

168
00:13:37,736 --> 00:13:40,330
All my classmates are married
and have 2 kids also.

169
00:13:40,739 --> 00:13:41,671
No need of all that

170
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,371
l brought Horlicks for sister-in-law
when she was carrying her.

171
00:13:43,609 --> 00:13:45,668
After birth l brought farex
after grown up complan.

172
00:13:46,044 --> 00:13:47,341
Now, l'm bringing her
everyday from school.

everything except work

Opening a new account
here is no big deal.

216
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:13,052

Greater fun is awaiting

232
00:17:31,403 --> 00:17:33,303
A sweet desire is
getting fulfilled.

233
00:17:33,538 --> 00:17:37,474
Come my hero. l'll give
what you desire.

234
00:17:37,843 --> 00:17:39,811

union with you.

237
00:18:36,668 --> 00:18:40,104
Memorizing me with
your first look

Don't vanish by bringing down
the curtains down slowly.

00:18:45,744 --> 00:18:49,111
Kissing me gently
and charming me

240
00:18:49,314 --> 00:18:54,183
Don't lit the passion of fire
overwhelming me.

241
00:18:55,087 --> 00:18:59,046
Suddenly, available of bones
have befallen on me

242
00:18:59,424 --> 00:19:02,985

My beauty is all yours

244
00:19:59,684 --> 00:20:03,176
How strange this feeling is.
Every cell of mine is excited.

245
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:08,324
Clam down my ruffled
passion a little.

246
00:20:08,727 --> 00:20:11,787
What's this shivering
of your lips & hips?

247
00:20:12,264 --> 00:20:16,564
Shall l drench you in
the rain of rises?

lsn't that the greatness
of martial relationship?

249
00:20:20,172 --> 00:20:22,163
Every moment is a bliss.

250
00:20:22,407 --> 00:20:26,309
Shall l give you all
the life my bliss of love?

251
00:20:30,949 --> 00:20:35,249
l've become your slave.

252
00:21:59,504 --> 00:22:01,597
Why are you crying sir?
Any bad memories?

253
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:04,235
Suddenly l felt like crying.
-Manager is calling you.

254
00:22:05,443 --> 00:22:06,000
Okay, come.

255
00:22:06,278 --> 00:22:07,677
Please talk to him and...
-l said l'll talk to him.

256
00:22:08,046 --> 00:22:10,571
Please come & sit.
-Coffee?- No please.

257
00:22:10,949 --> 00:22:13,144
Tea?
-Tell me the matter.

258
00:22:15,954 --> 00:22:17,581
You know about
Krishnaveni's matter.

259
00:22:17,956 --> 00:22:21,483
She have and her husband in
Hyderabad are facing difficulties.

260
00:22:21,993 --> 00:22:23,255
He's also working
with the same bank.

261
00:22:23,495 --> 00:22:26,157
So, if you accept for mutual transfer
and go to Hyderabad.

262
00:22:26,431 --> 00:22:27,159
He'll come here.

263
00:22:27,432 --> 00:22:28,592
Both will live here
like love birds...

264
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,490
They'll stop working in office
and start romancing.

265
00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:32,202
No Mr.Prasad...

266
00:22:32,437 --> 00:22:34,530
lnstead of bringing him here,
why can't you transfer her to Hyderabad?

267
00:22:34,773 --> 00:22:35,467
Headache will get rid
once for all.

268
00:22:35,674 --> 00:22:37,972
She owns a house here,
it's difficult to leave...

269
00:22:38,176 --> 00:22:40,201
Finding a house for rent in
Hyderabad is difficult for me too.

270
00:22:40,445 --> 00:22:42,538
Are you a married man?
What's your problem?

271
00:22:42,781 --> 00:22:45,477
That's the problem.
l was born & brought up here.

272
00:22:45,684 --> 00:22:46,480
No one is ready to give his
daughter in marriage to me.

273
00:22:46,685 --> 00:22:47,652
Who'll be ready in Hyderabad?

274
00:22:48,019 --> 00:22:48,986
What's the solution
to this problem?

275
00:22:49,187 --> 00:22:50,552
Simple! Tell her to
divorce her husband,

276
00:22:50,789 --> 00:22:52,017
and marry a local man.

277
00:22:52,257 --> 00:22:54,225
This is good idea.
-You keep quiet sir.

278
00:22:54,592 --> 00:22:56,992
lf you separate ideal couple
like Rama & Seetha,

279
00:22:57,228 --> 00:22:58,217
You'll never get married
in this life.

280
00:22:58,630 --> 00:22:59,153
Silly lady!

281
00:23:03,635 --> 00:23:04,465
My photographs.

282
00:23:11,509 --> 00:23:12,203
Who is he?

283
00:23:13,311 --> 00:23:15,074
ls he your husband?
-No.

284
00:23:15,246 --> 00:23:15,712
Thank god

285
00:23:16,081 --> 00:23:17,070
My future husband.

286
00:23:17,315 --> 00:23:21,046
He's also intrested to
open an account here.

287
00:23:21,319 --> 00:23:23,378
You needn't do anything.
he'll take care of everything.

288
00:23:23,755 --> 00:23:24,414
What will you do then?

289
00:23:24,656 --> 00:23:27,056
Will you have one soft drink
with 2 straws?

290
00:23:29,461 --> 00:23:30,621
Do you need any documents?

291
00:23:31,229 --> 00:23:33,129
One passport size photo.
Tenth class mark sheet.

00:23:33,365 --> 00:23:35,765

Rs.500 minimum balance

294
00:23:37,569 --> 00:23:40,766
lf you wait with the token
given by us for 2 hours.

295
00:23:41,239 --> 00:23:42,263
You'll get your pass book then.

296
00:23:42,707 --> 00:23:44,140
You didn't tell me all
this yesterday.

297
00:23:44,576 --> 00:23:45,770
You didn't bring him yesterday.

298
00:23:48,713 --> 00:23:51,204
l'll tell you a good news
if you pay Rs.3000.- what's it?

299
00:23:51,483 --> 00:23:53,280
Yesterday l got a
good proposal

300
00:23:53,585 --> 00:23:54,483
How many months old
pregnant she is?

301
00:23:55,253 --> 00:23:56,618
lt happened once.

302
00:23:56,821 --> 00:23:58,618
That doesn't mean every
girl will be pregnant.

303
00:23:58,823 --> 00:24:01,223
No, l'll not see another girl.

304
00:24:03,361 --> 00:24:05,727
This is the last.
-Don't get disappointed Prasad.

305
00:24:05,964 --> 00:24:07,397
ln another month
the bad mouth starts,

306
00:24:07,632 --> 00:24:08,792
Let's fix this proposal by then.

307
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,634
What couldn't happen in 10 years?
How can it happen in one month?

308
00:24:12,203 --> 00:24:13,500
You'll not say like this
on seeing her.

309
00:24:13,705 --> 00:24:16,731
Don't think l'm exaggerating.
l'll tell about her in 3 sentences.

310
00:24:16,975 --> 00:24:18,670
She's beautiful like
Aishwarya Rai.

311
00:24:18,877 --> 00:24:20,401
She sings like
Lata Mangeshkar.

312
00:24:20,779 --> 00:24:22,337
And dances like
Madhuri Dixit.

313
00:24:22,547 --> 00:24:24,174
No need of marriage to her.
Let her try for heroine's chance.

314
00:24:24,983 --> 00:24:27,349
How can a girl with so many
bad habits become my wife?

315
00:24:27,552 --> 00:24:29,417
Why do you get irritated
for simple things?

316
00:24:29,654 --> 00:24:32,418
They say god has created
all of us with a partner.

317
00:24:32,657 --> 00:24:34,557
The boy will be here
and hide the girl elsewhere.

318
00:24:34,793 --> 00:24:36,556
When the time comes
he'll make them meet.

319
00:24:36,828 --> 00:24:38,557
Likewise you'll also have a
partner fated to become yours.

320
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:40,354
Who's that? where's she?

321
00:24:40,598 --> 00:24:41,565
How am l to know
she's the girl?

322
00:24:41,833 --> 00:24:43,767
Will it rain flowers
when l meet the girl?

323
00:24:44,035 --> 00:24:44,899
Will the sky be
lit with lighting?

324
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:46,464
Will l hear any music
from back ground?

325
00:24:46,704 --> 00:24:49,935
Tell me about proposals?
l don't want tales

326
00:26:00,845 --> 00:26:01,607
Why are you doing
all this work?

327
00:26:01,846 --> 00:26:02,870
My wife will take care of it.

328
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:04,410
No problem..uncle

329

One minute, my husband
wants to talk to him

334
00:26:16,895 --> 00:26:18,624
l'm Subba Rao,
Can l speak to Mr. Murthy?

335
00:26:18,897 --> 00:26:19,829
He's not available.

336

That her true self.

337
00:26:22,033 --> 00:26:23,967
She appears intelligent
like lndira Gandhi.

338
00:26:24,135 --> 00:26:26,194
Her true color shows as
she opens her mouth.

339

She's not fated to

390
00:29:05,229 --> 00:29:05,957
Bye

391
00:29:07,899 --> 00:29:10,197
Will you tell him everything

l are going

398
00:29:38,196 --> 00:29:40,289
l just asked you
for a formality.

399
00:29:41,866 --> 00:29:42,355
Bye

400
00:29:51,309 --> 00:29:52,401
Do you also come to this
library regularity?

Are you a member here?
-Member? From years...

402
00:29:58,883 --> 00:30:01,408
lf you get a photo tomorrow,
we'll give you membership card.

403
00:30:07,792 --> 00:30:09,851
Why carry such a large book as if
you can understand it?

404
00:30:10,261 --> 00:30:11,193
This is my text book.

405
00:30:16,033 --> 00:30:18,399
Do you love children?

406
00:30:18,603 --> 00:30:19,535

00:30:23,708 --> 00:30:25,335
Not yet married?
what's your problem?

409
00:30:25,943 --> 00:30:28,741
l mean...basically l'm not
intrested in marriage.

410
00:30:30,281 --> 00:30:30,747
why?

411
00:30:31,282 --> 00:30:34,911
Because marriage is like eating
dinner in a 5 star hotel.

412
00:30:35,052 --> 00:30:37,486
lt'll be great fun to eat but
it'll pain while footing the bill.

413
00:30:40,625 --> 00:30:41,922
You mean?
-Didn't get me?

414
00:30:42,326 --> 00:30:43,258
Now, l'll tell you
in straight words.

415
00:30:43,761 --> 00:30:46,958
marriage is like rearing a cow.
lt'll be happy milking the cow.

416
00:30:47,432 --> 00:30:48,490
But disgusting while
cleaning the dung

417
00:30:48,733 --> 00:30:49,461
You mean?

418
00:30:50,334 --> 00:30:51,665
To tell you the truth,
l too don't know.

419
00:30:51,903 --> 00:30:53,871
Let's stop this discussion here.

420

Krishnaveni, your nail
l think you've forgotten.

431
00:32:01,305 --> 00:32:03,273
Don't keep it anywhere.
lt may hurt anyone any place.

432
00:32:03,975 --> 00:32:06,170
Bloody idiot.
He has eyes behind also.

433
00:32:06,377 --> 00:32:07,867
l'm going out lf manager

434

00:33:26,257 --> 00:33:28,225
Yes it's wrong. That's why l'm

446
00:33:35,399 --> 00:33:37,196

450
00:33:47,411 --> 00:33:50,073
Tell me one good reason, why l should

00:33:50,781 --> 00:33:52,043

Buy anyone sir. lt'll taste fantastic
- l don't want.

455
00:34:00,524 --> 00:34:01,286
lt's just Rs.2 a stick

456
00:34:01,525 --> 00:34:03,288
Not that l don't have money.
l don't like ice -cream.

457
00:34:04,195 --> 00:34:08,291
Am l a kid to eat your cheap
colored ice on broomstick?

458
00:34:08,566 --> 00:34:10,056
lf l see you again on beach.,

459
00:34:10,301 --> 00:34:11,393
l'll bury in beach sand
Be careful.

460
00:34:11,636 --> 00:34:12,330
GO away.

461
00:34:13,471 --> 00:34:14,335
l've seen plenty like you.

462
00:34:20,578 --> 00:34:22,478
Oh ! You too come to
this beach only.

463
00:34:23,147 --> 00:34:24,341
How many beaches Vizag has?

464
00:34:24,548 --> 00:34:26,106
Correct

465
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:30,482
lt's going to dark.
l think you've to go home.

466
00:34:32,323 --> 00:34:34,689
Who is there for me at home?
-Don't you've any one?

467
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:37,218
Why not? l've an elder brother
and sister-in-law.

468
00:34:37,728 --> 00:34:40,788
They have a 7 year old daughter
from 6 year marriage.- what's that?

469
00:34:41,198 --> 00:34:44,497
Sorry, they've 6 year old girl
from 7 year marriage.

470
00:34:45,636 --> 00:34:46,330
Don't you've good
relationship with them?

471
00:34:46,537 --> 00:34:48,334
No. no, they don't have good
relationship between themselves.

472
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:50,664
Brother is short tempered and
sister-in-law has great strength.

473
00:34:50,975 --> 00:34:52,408
So, naturally they are always
at loggerheads.

474
00:34:52,777 --> 00:34:54,404
They think of divorce
before every argument.

475
00:34:54,645 --> 00:34:56,670
They are not bothered about
their daughter's future.

476
00:34:57,314 --> 00:34:59,407
That's not a home,
but a 900 sq . ft. hell.

477
00:35:01,218 --> 00:35:02,185
What can you do?

478
00:35:05,222 --> 00:35:06,280
Locket is very good.

479
00:35:06,557 --> 00:35:08,218
This is not locket, but
Lord Anjaneya's amulet.

480
00:35:08,459 --> 00:35:10,290
My mother tied it when l
fell sick a little boy.

481
00:35:10,561 --> 00:35:12,426
Whatever l ask holding it,
the wish will be granted.

482
00:35:12,697 --> 00:35:13,686
Powerful god!

483
00:35:14,265 --> 00:35:16,290
That's why l'll die but
never remove it.

484
00:35:16,701 --> 00:35:18,396
lce cream.
-Shall we have an ice cream?

485
00:35:18,836 --> 00:35:19,860
Okay, l'll get it.

486
00:35:20,604 --> 00:35:22,799
Mango, graphs, orange, ice...
-Give me 2 ice creams.

487
00:35:24,041 --> 00:35:27,408
l'll not sell.
-Oh, ls it you? Please sir.

488
00:35:27,611 --> 00:35:29,943
We are selling cheap colored
ice on broom sticks.

489
00:35:30,381 --> 00:35:31,609
You'll spoil you health
if you eat this.

490
00:35:31,849 --> 00:35:33,407
l think you've taken my words
to your heart.

491
00:35:34,452 --> 00:35:35,919
l'll lose my honor before a girl.
-l'll not sell.

492
00:35:36,287 --> 00:35:37,254
l'll pay Rs.10.

493
00:35:38,055 --> 00:35:39,249
Rs.20 -No way.

494
00:35:39,623 --> 00:35:42,421
Settle it finally at Rs.50.
-No impossible.

495
00:35:42,626 --> 00:35:43,684
Come on take this. Give me.

496

Have it.

499
00:35:54,772 --> 00:35:55,966
Good! -Yes.

500
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:58,467
madam, please spare a rupee.

501
00:36:01,045 --> 00:36:02,535
You're also merciful like me.

502
00:36:03,047 --> 00:36:03,979
Just now, l gave this boy

503
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:07,314
l don't want.

504
00:36:09,386 --> 00:36:09,818
l don't want.

505
00:36:14,925 --> 00:36:15,983
Don't know who is mother is.

506
00:36:22,399 --> 00:36:22,888
l'm caught.

507
00:36:25,503 --> 00:36:26,800
How much? - Rs.100.

508
00:36:30,741 --> 00:36:32,038
lt seems he ahs to pay his
daughter's tuition fees.

509
00:36:32,643 --> 00:36:35,373
l generally shell out

00:37:04,909 --> 00:37:05,773
Excuse me, your bag.

What's all these accounts?
Keep it there.

518
00:37:14,251 --> 00:37:14,945

519
00:37:21,158 --> 00:37:21,783
What sir?

520
00:37:22,059 --> 00:37:25,551
By a razor, fair & lovely cream
and keep it in bath room.

521
00:37:26,096 --> 00:37:28,530
ls the girl fair?
-How did you find it?

522
00:37:28,766 --> 00:37:30,893
why would you buy a
costly fairness cream?

523
00:37:31,869 --> 00:37:32,836
lt's the problem you.

524
00:37:34,104 --> 00:37:34,934
You give an inch of liberty,
you take to a mile.

525
00:37:35,539 --> 00:37:38,167
ls she beautiful?
-Beautiful?

526
00:37:38,776 --> 00:37:42,735
She'll be like a mixture of
Aishwarya Rai & Kareena.

527
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:44,743
lf she's that great beauty,
will she marry you?

528
00:37:44,982 --> 00:37:46,745
Let's try, if she marries,
it's my luck.

529
00:37:46,984 --> 00:37:48,178
ls she refuses...
-lt's the girl's luck.

530
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:50,950
l mean did you speak
with the girl?

531
00:37:51,989 --> 00:37:54,549
Speak? we had an ice-cream
together in beach yesterday.

532
00:37:54,792 --> 00:37:55,884
Today also we'll meet
and eat something.

533
00:37:56,126 --> 00:37:57,559
How can you be so sure sir?

534
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:02,230
Asking me how!
l'm a born genius.

535
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,090
l left my bag with
Maleeshwari yesterday.

536
00:38:08,038 --> 00:38:09,266
You're studying 2nd class.

537
00:38:09,707 --> 00:38:12,141
Don't you know to borrow one from
side to subtract 9 from 8?

538
00:38:13,611 --> 00:38:16,808
You told it's wrong
to take loan, daddy.

539
00:38:17,047 --> 00:38:19,277
Nothing short in this cleverness.
Do your home work.

540
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,244
Are you Varaprasad's brother?

541
00:38:24,855 --> 00:38:25,822
Did he do anything to you?

542
00:38:26,857 --> 00:38:28,256
He left this bag in
my house yesterday.

543
00:38:29,059 --> 00:38:29,923
Why did he come
to your house?

544
00:38:30,394 --> 00:38:31,588
Unable to come to your house

545
00:38:39,436 --> 00:38:41,131
Are you going out?
-Yes.

546
00:38:42,006 --> 00:38:43,405
Can l talk to you for a minute?

547
00:38:44,909 --> 00:38:46,069
Sorry, l'm getting late
to my bus.

548
00:38:47,111 --> 00:38:49,306
You can get another bus
if you miss one.

549
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,648
But, you can't get a life
if you miss one.

550
00:38:51,849 --> 00:38:53,646
Your quotation is right.
But whose life?

551
00:38:53,784 --> 00:38:55,809
Why are you so stubborn?

552
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:57,749
This is not stubborness
but punctuality.

553
00:38:58,022 --> 00:38:58,886
l can't do my work if i don't
go at right time.

554
00:38:59,123 --> 00:39:00,886
lf you can't do one work...
l can do another work.

555
00:39:01,125 --> 00:39:02,353
But why are you
telling all this?

556
00:39:02,927 --> 00:39:04,019
because you are doing
a wrong thing

557
00:39:06,163 --> 00:39:08,324
Who gave you the right to play]
with your wife's life?

558
00:39:09,433 --> 00:39:12,129
Am l playing with her life?
She's playing with my life.

559
00:39:12,736 --> 00:39:14,863
Why are you still hiding?
Look. How she is crying?

560
00:39:15,439 --> 00:39:18,374
Are you crying?
-No, l was cutting onions.

561
00:39:18,742 --> 00:39:20,403
Don't tell lies,
You'll beget girls.

562
00:39:20,844 --> 00:39:23,278
No way, she had an operation.
-Don't change the topic.

563
00:39:23,514 --> 00:39:27,280
Who are you? why did you come here?
what do you want?

564
00:39:27,985 --> 00:39:29,748
l want you both to be happy.

565
00:39:30,454 --> 00:39:34,049
We are happy.
-No Varaprasad told me everything.

566
00:39:34,758 --> 00:39:37,090
Can't you live together at least
for your daughter?

567
00:39:38,095 --> 00:39:40,063
What will you achieve
by divorcing each other?

568
00:39:40,798 --> 00:39:41,287
Divorce?

569
00:39:48,372 --> 00:39:50,465
Why are you studying so sincerely?
lsn't your father in station?

570
00:39:52,042 --> 00:39:53,134
Take the chocolate.

571
00:39:53,811 --> 00:39:56,780
Chocolate must be big like this
-Okay.

572
00:39:57,481 --> 00:40:00,450
Sister-in-law, get me hot water,
l'll take bath & go out.

573
00:40:00,918 --> 00:40:01,441
lf l refuse...

574
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,114
l'll go out without
taking bath.

575
00:40:05,389 --> 00:40:06,947
Why is she so serious?

576
00:40:10,828 --> 00:40:13,228
Why are you roaming like
a rowdy with a belt around neck?

577
00:40:17,101 --> 00:40:18,398
Did Maleeshwari come here?

578
00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:21,164
You said said you'll be
going out of station.

579
00:40:21,872 --> 00:40:22,804
l've postponed it.

580
00:40:24,208 --> 00:40:25,539
l've little work outside.
l'll come immediately.

581
00:40:25,976 --> 00:40:27,409
You postpone it.

582
00:40:29,446 --> 00:40:31,073
l think it'll not be good to
fight before sister-in-law.

583
00:40:31,315 --> 00:40:32,509
No problem, it'll be fine.

584
00:40:33,650 --> 00:40:36,084
Dolly will get scared.
-She gave me the belt herself.

585
00:40:36,653 --> 00:40:37,210
l'm a little boy...

586
00:40:37,454 --> 00:40:39,081
That's why did you
tell her big lies...

587
00:40:39,323 --> 00:40:45,193
Brother no..-Stop.

588
00:40:55,039 --> 00:40:55,971
Give me a kilo eggs.

589
00:40:57,274 --> 00:40:58,571
One dozen? -Yes.

590
00:41:03,047 --> 00:41:04,605
How much? -Rs.12.

591
00:41:05,516 --> 00:41:08,576
lf one is Rs.12 then...

592
00:41:11,288 --> 00:41:13,153
Rs.144 for a dozen eggs!

593
00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:16,257
l didn't ask...she gave herself.
-will you take if she gives?

594
00:41:16,527 --> 00:41:18,017
Leave him.

595
00:41:19,430 --> 00:41:20,624
why are you sparing him
rhough he's lying?

596
00:41:21,098 --> 00:41:21,689
Didn't l spare you?

597
00:41:22,699 --> 00:41:25,998
You mean did l lie to you?
Did l lie to you?

598
00:41:26,437 --> 00:41:28,200
You mean, did l lie to you?

599
00:41:29,339 --> 00:41:31,204
Okay, l did .
Do you know why l lied?

600
00:41:32,443 --> 00:41:34,468
So, l can't speak about
cricket or movies with you.

601
00:41:34,711 --> 00:41:36,542
Fate and holy scripts
is out of question

602
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:38,543
What else can l talk with you?
Give me the bag.

603
00:41:39,116 --> 00:41:40,481
Whether l told you
lies or truths

604
00:41:40,684 --> 00:41:41,651
But it did help you in finding a
good friend like me, didn't it?

605
00:41:43,253 --> 00:41:45,221
They eat & throw away on road
banana peals.

606
00:41:46,457 --> 00:41:48,550
On road!
what if anyone slips & falls on it.

607
00:41:49,026 --> 00:41:50,755
Whatever l do never
hurts anyone.

608
00:41:52,629 --> 00:41:55,097
My sister-in-law or brother
are no ideal couple

609
00:41:55,232 --> 00:41:57,223
Sister-in-law sometimes
do beats my brother.

610
00:41:57,501 --> 00:41:58,399
after hearing all this.

611
00:41:58,635 --> 00:42:00,728
You might feel you've
misunderstand this peace.

612
00:42:01,171 --> 00:42:03,605
But, l don't feel for anything.
l'll forget all the past.

613
00:42:06,076 --> 00:42:08,738
Won't you listen to me?
That's all. ls it the final.?

614
00:42:09,179 --> 00:42:11,272
Are you the only to get angry.
l too get angry.

615
00:42:11,515 --> 00:42:13,380
l'll never show my beautiful face
to you in this life.

616
00:42:32,569 --> 00:42:48,042


617
00:42:50,053 --> 00:42:53,147
Your smiles...
are moonlit nights.

618
00:42:53,490 --> 00:42:56,687
are jasmines...
are rainbows...

619
00:42:56,927 --> 00:43:00,488
Let anyone say anything...

620
00:43:00,731 --> 00:43:03,962
what am l to say they are
nothing compared to your smile.

621
00:43:05,235 --> 00:44:01,748


622
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:09,160
Won't gold lose it's color
seeing your complexion?

623
00:44:10,067 --> 00:44:16,597
Won't hibiscus consider lucky to
bloom ad reach your hair?

624
00:44:17,107 --> 00:44:23,979
make a life size statue
in milk & flowers,

625
00:44:24,248 --> 00:44:27,684
Applying the bright
moonbeam on the body

626
00:44:27,918 --> 00:44:31,319
And giving it life
with honey.

627
00:44:31,688 --> 00:44:38,218
Won't Brahma, the creator feel proud
of himself for creating you?

628
00:45:21,004 --> 00:45:27,341
You never turn back to see me
though l chase you all the day.

629
00:45:28,245 --> 00:45:34,775
You'll never leave me a minute
all night with mischief dreams.

630
00:45:35,252 --> 00:45:38,483
lt's you everywhere l see.

631
00:45:38,922 --> 00:45:42,289
You'll trap in your love
Making me numb.

632
00:45:42,592 --> 00:45:45,823
You hug me with your smile.

633
00:45:46,063 --> 00:45:49,464
why are you tempting me
so much?

634
00:45:49,833 --> 00:45:52,893
Accept the crimes you've
committed on me.

635
00:45:53,270 --> 00:45:56,501
Are you blaming me after
committing crimes yourself?

636
00:47:04,808 --> 00:47:05,934
make it little bigger...
-Okay.

637
00:47:06,343 --> 00:47:07,310
Tomato gravy is good.

638
00:47:11,348 --> 00:47:12,440
Come, l'll give you also.

639
00:47:12,682 --> 00:47:14,877
No, sister-in-law, but brother is
satiated on seeing you like this

640
00:47:15,118 --> 00:47:16,551
My finger got cut.

641
00:47:16,787 --> 00:47:17,685
Finger got cut?
Then, eat with a spoon.

642
00:47:17,921 --> 00:47:19,013
lf you can't then stop eating

643
00:47:19,456 --> 00:47:21,822
You shouldn't behave like this
with a young bachelor around here.

644
00:47:22,058 --> 00:47:22,683
Why are you so angry?

645
00:47:22,926 --> 00:47:25,087
lf you get a wife in future,
she'll also feed you like this.

646
00:47:25,529 --> 00:47:26,689
You've been saying this
for the past 7 years.

647
00:47:26,930 --> 00:47:28,761
leave about marriage not even
my firs night happened.

648
00:47:29,699 --> 00:47:31,030
l meant...engagement.

649
00:47:31,468 --> 00:47:32,560
Time must be
favourable for anything.

650
00:47:32,803 --> 00:47:33,770
You should've intrest.

651
00:47:34,070 --> 00:47:36,004
My father refused your proposal as
your people couldn't dowry.

652
00:47:36,373 --> 00:47:38,034
l fought with him and
got you both married.

653
00:47:38,475 --> 00:47:40,033
Now, there's no dowry problem,
luckily father is also no more.

654
00:47:40,510 --> 00:47:42,375
But still he's doing nothing.
Think over it.

655
00:47:42,746 --> 00:47:44,543
Why did a girl come home
with brother' bag?

656
00:47:44,748 --> 00:47:46,943
Why did he go to ger house?
why did he forget this bag there?

657
00:47:47,184 --> 00:47:48,412
Why did he lie to
her about you?

658
00:47:48,652 --> 00:47:50,620
ls he in love with that girl?
That's why he took all this trouble?

659
00:47:50,854 --> 00:47:53,618
Did you think about asking all this?
-No.

660
00:47:53,990 --> 00:47:55,048
l didn't know who she is...

661
00:47:57,661 --> 00:47:59,060
That's her address and her
name is Malleeshwari.

662
00:47:59,863 --> 00:48:01,956
Her parents are also here.
Settle this issue quickly.

663
00:48:04,534 --> 00:48:06,058
we don't have any idea about
her marriage in near future.

664
00:48:07,437 --> 00:48:09,837
tell us, when are you planning.
we'll wait till then.

665
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:11,634
We never thought about it.

666
00:48:11,875 --> 00:48:14,639
Do you've any other proposal?
-Nothing like that.

667
00:48:15,045 --> 00:48:17,639
is she in love with anyone else?
-No.

668
00:48:17,914 --> 00:48:18,676
What's your problem then?

669
00:48:19,816 --> 00:48:21,545
maleeshwari is not daughter.
That's the problem

670
00:48:21,818 --> 00:48:22,216
You mean...

671
00:48:22,719 --> 00:48:24,687
She doesn't have parents.
She is an orphan.

672
00:48:24,921 --> 00:48:26,821
lt's good that she has got
such a good proposal.

673
00:48:27,057 --> 00:48:28,149
You don't think any more.

674
00:48:28,592 --> 00:48:30,685
What are you saying sir?
Do you know who is maleeshwari?

675
00:48:30,927 --> 00:48:32,622
l'm talking to then, ain't l?
you go inside.

676
00:48:35,165 --> 00:48:37,633
She has brought her from
native place to help her.

677
00:48:37,934 --> 00:48:39,697
You mean...maid servant?

678
00:48:40,203 --> 00:48:40,794
yes

679
00:48:44,508 --> 00:48:44,974
Then?

680
00:48:45,175 --> 00:48:45,698
You keep quiet.

681
00:48:46,977 --> 00:48:48,968
l think we've embarrassed you
wiyhout having details

682
00:48:49,212 --> 00:48:50,179
Please forgive us.
-No problem.

683
00:48:50,647 --> 00:48:51,579
Bye...Bye...

684
00:48:54,885 --> 00:48:56,819
Whaere's prasad?
-He is inside.

685
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:57,882
What's this man?

686
00:48:58,121 --> 00:48:59,679
lt seems some one has loaned
Rs.10 lakh to our bank.

687
00:48:59,890 --> 00:49:01,016
Rs.10 lakh & Rs.15000

688
00:49:01,791 --> 00:49:03,622
Giving loan to bank?
-That is...

689
00:49:04,561 --> 00:49:06,893
Don't come to bank from tomorrow.
l'll send your salary home.

690
00:49:09,566 --> 00:49:10,624
l want to talk with you.

691
00:49:16,339 --> 00:49:17,567
Come yes sir.

692
00:49:18,675 --> 00:49:20,040
Please come ....Sit here.

693
00:49:21,945 --> 00:49:23,810
What do you think of yourself?
-what happened?

694
00:49:24,047 --> 00:49:26,242
Will you send your people with
proposal just for talking with you?

695
00:49:26,716 --> 00:49:27,944
did my brother & sister-in-law come?

696
00:49:28,184 --> 00:49:31,017
They came with a priest
to fix date & time also.

697
00:49:31,955 --> 00:49:34,617
Sorry brother, l misunderstood
you all these days

698
00:49:34,858 --> 00:49:36,689
l never thought you're
such a rogue.

699
00:49:37,861 --> 00:49:39,294
l behaved normally
feeling pity on you.

700
00:49:39,729 --> 00:49:40,627
And you're taking undue advantage
and behaving crazily.

701
00:49:41,665 --> 00:49:45,101
l got insulted for your doing
in my house., ls it?

702
00:49:46,202 --> 00:49:47,635
Do you consider yourself
a great hero?

703
00:49:49,205 --> 00:49:52,606
will girls fall for your
toothy big smile?

704
00:49:52,976 --> 00:49:53,635
that is...

705
00:49:55,445 --> 00:49:57,310
l thought mad men were only
in vizag mental hospital.

706
00:49:57,681 --> 00:49:59,876
Now l know they're on roads
also after seeing you.

707
00:50:01,918 --> 00:50:05,877
Look, if you come to my house again,
you'll lose your respect.

708
00:50:06,122 --> 00:50:08,682
Do you want me to come to the library?
-Don't you've any sense?

709
00:50:08,925 --> 00:50:11,985
l've but, l'll use it limitedly.
-Don't unnecessarily incite me.

710
00:50:13,930 --> 00:50:15,329
l'm sparing you with
a warning this time.

711
00:50:15,699 --> 00:50:19,157
Next time, l'll beat you.
-All right wait for it.

712
00:50:21,705 --> 00:50:22,171
Fro me...

713
00:50:25,709 --> 00:50:27,836
Okay...l'll definitely take you
be ready.

714
00:50:28,845 --> 00:50:29,334
What is she saying?

715
00:50:29,913 --> 00:50:30,902
She's creating a scene to
take her to a movie.

716
00:50:31,181 --> 00:50:33,046
l couldn't take her yesterday,
that's why she's angry.

717
00:50:33,416 --> 00:50:37,284
Movie? lf such a girl request,
l'll go to graveyard also.

718
00:50:41,587 --> 00:50:43,214
He's an accountant
with Andhra Bank.

719
00:50:43,422 --> 00:50:44,912
Look he's here...
he has long life.

720
00:50:45,357 --> 00:50:46,585
My brother.
-Greetings.

721
00:50:46,825 --> 00:50:47,723
Prasad, one minute

722
00:50:48,827 --> 00:50:50,260
Boy is like sword.

723
00:50:50,496 --> 00:50:53,465
He was like a dagger
he's on diet now.

724
00:50:54,266 --> 00:50:56,393
He's raghava rao from
Bundar to see you.

725
00:50:56,602 --> 00:50:57,261
What about maleeshwari?

726
00:50:57,503 --> 00:50:58,561
Forget her.- Brother.

727
00:50:58,837 --> 00:51:00,805
At last we've got a good
proposal on it's own

728
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:02,405
You don't have any second
thoughts...just say yes.

729
00:51:02,608 --> 00:51:03,267
l'll take care of other things.

730
00:51:03,542 --> 00:51:05,271
Brother, listen to me
-Dear...-Coming.

731
00:51:13,318 --> 00:51:14,615
Greetings sir.-Greetings.

732
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:16,287
My daughter's photo.

733
00:51:18,090 --> 00:51:18,954
She's good.

734
00:51:19,992 --> 00:51:22,392
lf you tell him about
your dowry demands...

735
00:51:22,761 --> 00:51:24,991
l've to tell you about an
important thing above all.

736
00:51:25,364 --> 00:51:25,796
Go ahead.

737
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:29,265
l love a girl.

738
00:51:30,903 --> 00:51:32,871
l don't have any objection to
marry your daughter.

739
00:51:33,338 --> 00:51:33,963
What's in love?

740
00:51:34,339 --> 00:51:34,998
After bank closes at 5 pm,

741
00:51:35,441 --> 00:51:36,999
l'll go around with her for a hour
and reach home at 7 pm.

742
00:51:37,476 --> 00:51:39,000
After that it'll be with
your daughter only.

743
00:51:39,378 --> 00:51:39,969
What's her name?

744
00:51:40,946 --> 00:51:42,413
Name is also wonderful.

745
00:51:43,482 --> 00:51:44,005
What are you looking at?

746
00:51:44,483 --> 00:51:45,006
he says he loves some one else.

747
00:51:45,484 --> 00:51:47,679
You've suspecting will l take
care of her properly.

748
00:51:48,487 --> 00:51:50,387
We've a black & white Dyanora T.V.

749
00:51:50,622 --> 00:51:51,589
We brought a color T.V. Recently.

750
00:51:51,824 --> 00:51:54,384
Did we throw away the old T.V?
we are using it in bed room.

751
00:51:54,626 --> 00:51:55,354
This is also the same.

752
00:51:55,961 --> 00:51:58,020
That is love...this is marriage.
Both don't have any connection.

753
00:51:58,397 --> 00:51:59,591
lF you understand that,

754
00:51:59,832 --> 00:52:01,857
You needn't get worried
about public comments.

755
00:52:02,835 --> 00:52:04,700
Discuss other details with
my brother.l'll take leave.

756
00:52:06,405 --> 00:52:07,872
He has told you
everything clearly.

757
00:52:08,073 --> 00:52:09,370
Shall l fix the date
of marriage?

758
00:52:11,443 --> 00:52:12,705
Will he marry my daughter
loving some other girl?

759
00:52:13,011 --> 00:52:16,742
Not some girl, she's Maleeshwari.
She's very beautiful.

760
00:52:17,015 --> 00:52:18,778
did you bring this proposal
knowing everything?

761
00:52:19,017 --> 00:52:22,783
lf l see you again in
my street, you're dead.

762
00:52:24,556 --> 00:52:25,921
Where's he?
-He has left.

763
00:52:26,158 --> 00:52:27,648
Left? why?

764
00:52:27,893 --> 00:52:29,986
what will happen? your brother
told him about Maleeshwari.

765
00:52:33,465 --> 00:52:35,592
What's it brother?
-what did he tell him?

766
00:52:35,801 --> 00:52:37,666
You may also beat
me if you hear that.

767
00:52:37,903 --> 00:52:40,667
That concept is so new.
For god's sake leave me.

768
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:44,133
At last we got
a good proposal,

769
00:52:44,610 --> 00:52:46,134
ls this the way to treat them?
-What did l do?

770
00:52:46,612 --> 00:52:47,977
Didn't l tell you to forget
about Maleeshwari?

771
00:52:48,180 --> 00:52:49,147
What's so great about her?

772
00:52:49,615 --> 00:52:51,606
No parents, no property,
no caste, or race.

773
00:52:51,850 --> 00:52:53,283
She's a mid to them.

774
00:52:53,519 --> 00:52:54,713
How can you be happy
marrying such a girl?

775
00:52:55,754 --> 00:52:56,186
When l fell in love with her,

776
00:52:56,622 --> 00:52:58,487
l didn't know she was an orphan
and had no property.

777
00:52:58,690 --> 00:53:00,055
You know it now, don't you?
-So what?

778
00:53:00,225 --> 00:53:02,989
Will a lover of sweet, lose intrest
on knowing he has diabetes?

779
00:53:03,762 --> 00:53:05,491
lt's true Maleeshwari
doesn't have parents.

780
00:53:05,864 --> 00:53:08,196
But women don't have parents
after marriage. Husband is everything.

781
00:53:08,634 --> 00:53:09,828
That isn't a problem with me.

782
00:53:10,636 --> 00:53:11,660
Coming to property matter.

783
00:53:12,237 --> 00:53:13,829
Character is the biggest
asset to any girl.

784
00:53:14,540 --> 00:53:15,871
Maleeshwari is wealthy in that.

785
00:53:17,109 --> 00:53:17,939
Coming to caste.

786
00:53:18,343 --> 00:53:19,776
Caste which is used only to
fight and divide people.

787
00:53:20,012 --> 00:53:22,003
Caste which can't help
two lovers to unite,

788
00:53:22,247 --> 00:53:22,975
l hate it.

789
00:53:24,016 --> 00:53:26,246
People ask bride to be if she
can cook & do household work.

790
00:53:26,919 --> 00:53:29,046
But my future wife is very good
in that before marriage.

791
00:53:30,022 --> 00:53:31,546
You call Maleeshwari
as maid servant.

792
00:53:31,823 --> 00:53:33,120
l call her as one who
knows to work.

793
00:53:34,026 --> 00:53:36,221
l can tell people who can listen.
what am i to tell people who argue?

794
00:53:36,929 --> 00:53:37,725
Do as you wish.

795
00:53:46,838 --> 00:53:47,896
l've found Maleeshwari.

796
00:53:48,607 --> 00:53:50,131
You'll get her body
by tomorrow morning.

797
00:53:56,515 --> 00:53:57,846
l want to talk to you about
an important thing.

798
00:53:59,651 --> 00:54:02,119
My life depends on
your decision.

799
00:54:20,239 --> 00:54:22,673
Good book! ln that book the
hero kills the heroine.

800
00:54:22,908 --> 00:54:24,398
But it's revealed in the climax.
lt's suspence.

801
00:54:27,279 --> 00:54:29,577
why are you not talking to me?
what have l done?

802
00:54:30,148 --> 00:54:31,445
What do you want sir?
-Come later.

803
00:54:32,484 --> 00:54:33,382
l know your problem.

804
00:54:33,619 --> 00:54:35,678
You don't have any money, do you?
- l have.

805
00:54:36,622 --> 00:54:37,520
You know one thing.

806
00:54:38,056 --> 00:54:39,717
My salary is Rs.9000 after cuts.

807
00:54:41,159 --> 00:54:43,059
Even if we spend lavishy,
it won't cross Rs.5000.

808
00:54:43,295 --> 00:54:44,592
l'll give the balance to you.

809
00:54:45,297 --> 00:54:48,266
l'll leave to you. Buy gold or
bungalows. l'll not interfere.

810
00:54:49,067 --> 00:54:50,193
What would you like to have sir?
ldli...dosa...

811
00:54:50,402 --> 00:54:52,199
She gave 5 minutes after
chasing her for a week.

812
00:54:52,404 --> 00:54:53,701
Can't you wait?
will you die if you?

813
00:54:54,306 --> 00:54:55,364
Talking about idlies & Dosas...

814
00:54:55,641 --> 00:54:57,040
This problem will not arise
if wee get married.

815
00:54:57,242 --> 00:54:58,368
We can prepare idlies at home.

816
00:54:59,544 --> 00:55:00,533
l'll tell you a secret.
l've booked a flat in MVP Colony.

817
00:55:03,448 --> 00:55:04,312
My brother also doesn't know it.

818
00:55:04,549 --> 00:55:06,176
Nothing, they'll feel jealous,
That's why l didn't tell them.

819
00:55:09,554 --> 00:55:11,749
lt'll take one and a half minute
to walk from corner to corner.

820
00:55:12,891 --> 00:55:14,756
just say yes, l'll look after you
like a Princes.

821
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:17,453
A foot of jasmine garland every day.
A movie every week.

822
00:55:17,696 --> 00:55:18,594
A picnic every month

823
00:55:18,797 --> 00:55:21,265
A trip every year to Ooty or
Kodaikanal on LTC

824
00:55:22,234 --> 00:55:24,429
there's nothing rich people
like us can't do.

825
00:55:25,570 --> 00:55:26,537
No need to say it now

826
00:55:27,472 --> 00:55:28,268
l'll come tomorrow evening.

827
00:55:28,473 --> 00:55:30,771
Think over it and
say yes. Let's do it.

828
00:55:31,943 --> 00:55:35,845
Hey, two people are sitting here.
won't you ask or love about them?

829
00:55:36,281 --> 00:55:37,509
Are you a waiter or a jogger?

830
00:55:37,749 --> 00:55:38,807
Go and get 2 coffee.

831
00:55:56,768 --> 00:55:57,860
Food items here are fantastic.
-True?

832
00:55:59,871 --> 00:56:01,736
Did you bring it from the
stove or stove itself?

833
00:56:02,307 --> 00:56:02,932
What do you say?

834
00:56:04,209 --> 00:56:06,837
What is it? l'm asking and
you are saying nothing.

835
00:56:07,245 --> 00:56:08,644
ls the book more important than me?
Give me the book.

836
00:56:33,505 --> 00:56:34,802
l'm balaji speaking.

837
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:36,268
have you sent the
body to Hyderabad?

838
00:56:36,508 --> 00:56:38,806
No sir, l've just come
out of hospital.

839
00:56:39,311 --> 00:56:40,471
You failed to kill a girl.

840
00:56:40,879 --> 00:56:42,005
But claim yourself as
great professional killer.

841
00:56:42,481 --> 00:56:45,279
A man hit me at
a sensitive place.

842
00:56:45,751 --> 00:56:46,945
My hand fell into hot soup.

843
00:56:47,319 --> 00:56:50,379
l hit a pillar and as the door opened...
l couldn't complete my job.

844
00:56:50,655 --> 00:56:54,955
Listen...tell me if you can do it

a short-tempered man.

1014
01:12:02,700 --> 01:12:04,600
Oh No, now you're here.

1015
01:12:04,835 --> 01:12:06,268
Who are you? who is this girl?

1016
01:12:06,504 --> 01:12:07,732
why are you going to
Hyderabad at his hour?

1017
01:12:07,972 --> 01:12:09,906
won't you feel like beating any one
if they ask such questions?

1018
01:12:10,274 --> 01:12:10,797
Correct

1019
01:12:11,609 --> 01:12:13,941
Thank god! l don't ask.

-lt came to halt.

1022
01:12:24,555 --> 01:12:25,988
But why?-Flat tyre.

1024
01:12:28,326 --> 01:12:29,520
lt's difficult in this
darkness, madam.

1025
01:12:33,097 --> 01:12:34,792
Tell me the truth.
-There's no spare tyre.

1026
01:12:34,999 --> 01:12:35,988
Can't you tell me that first?

1027
01:12:36,500 --> 01:12:38,331
l thought of telling but was
scared you might get angry.

1028
01:12:38,569 --> 01:12:40,730
Di l think like a
short-tempered guy?

1029
01:12:41,005 --> 01:12:42,996
What do you think of me?
Am l a B.P patient?

1030
01:12:43,441 --> 01:12:44,533
l never get angry.

1031
01:12:44,909 --> 01:12:46,536

after you've said that.

1032
01:12:46,777 --> 01:12:48,972
What shall we do now?
-Let's go to sleep.

1033
01:12:49,447 --> 01:12:52,644
Any good hotel near by?
-Do you want a/c or non-a/c?

1034
01:12:53,484 --> 01:12:55,384
Why are you staring at me?
You needn't look that.

1035
01:12:55,619 --> 01:12:56,916
People get scared when you
look at them normally.

1036
01:12:57,154 --> 01:12:59,850
l'm not talking with you, shut up.
-Find your own way.

1037
01:13:00,825 --> 01:13:01,849
That's why l told you.

1038
01:13:02,827 --> 01:13:04,522
Though she's a girl.

1039
01:13:04,729 --> 01:13:05,388
Tell me the truth.

1040
01:13:05,629 --> 01:13:07,358
Very proud.
-This is correct.

1041
01:13:11,435 --> 01:13:12,060
Let's sleep here.

1042
01:13:12,837 --> 01:13:14,930
What are you thinking?
-How to go up?

1043
01:13:15,172 --> 01:13:17,697
No need to go up. Let's bring it down.
-Correct sir.

1044
01:13:17,975 --> 01:13:18,942
What are you waiting
for then? Start..

1045
01:13:21,979 --> 01:13:24,743
why are you defiling the bottle?
Shouldn't l drink it?

1046
01:13:25,015 --> 01:13:26,915
won't you drink?
-No.

1047
01:13:27,151 --> 01:13:28,083
Good! Hold this.

1048
01:13:31,455 --> 01:13:31,887
Give me that.

1049
01:13:33,958 --> 01:13:35,789
That's it. -lt's itching.

1050
01:13:36,127 --> 01:13:36,855
Come and sleep.

1051
01:13:37,561 --> 01:13:38,528
Pillow

1052
01:13:54,812 --> 01:13:56,439
Why are you putting up
a compound wall?

1053
01:13:56,847 --> 01:13:59,111
l don't want to see your
nasty face on walking up.

1054
01:13:59,517 --> 01:14:01,678
lt'll help us in not seeing
your face all the night.

1055
01:14:07,091 --> 01:14:08,991
Didn't sleep yet?
-No sir.

1056
01:14:09,527 --> 01:14:12,496
l've to sing or some one must narrate
a story to put me to sleep.

1057
01:14:12,696 --> 01:14:14,163
You don't sing a song,
l'll tell you a story.

1058
01:14:14,532 --> 01:14:15,863
Ghosts & devils shouldn't
come in the story

1059
01:14:16,100 --> 01:14:16,725
Are you afraid?

1060
01:14:16,967 --> 01:14:18,992
No, l thought no need of all
that crap at night.

1061
01:14:19,303 --> 01:14:21,533
Tell me a movie story.
-Movie story?

1062
01:14:23,774 --> 01:14:25,935
l was returning after watching
'kashmora' late night show.

1063
01:14:26,544 --> 01:14:28,739
lt was winter time.
More over mid-night.

1064
01:14:29,113 --> 01:14:30,671
Roads were all deserted

1065
01:14:31,148 --> 01:14:33,048
l increased the speed of bike
and turned in to a street,

1066
01:14:33,250 --> 01:14:34,581
A street light was burning
at other end of the street.

1067
01:14:34,819 --> 01:14:39,552
l heard a sound from distance.
-Dog?-No fox.

1068
01:14:40,825 --> 01:14:42,258
l went further up without
bothering about it.

1069
01:14:42,693 --> 01:14:43,990
there's a graveyard
at the end of the street.

1070
01:14:44,361 --> 01:14:46,056
l've to cross it to
reach my house.

1071
01:14:46,697 --> 01:14:48,790
When l reached the graveyard,
there was a loud noise

1072
01:14:49,033 --> 01:14:51,228
Street light went out.
l got scared.

1073
01:14:51,702 --> 01:14:54,796
l increased the speed further,
suddenly l heard a loud noise.

1074
01:14:55,306 --> 01:14:56,136
Flat tyre

1075
01:14:56,373 --> 01:14:57,237
Let his mouth get
a paralysis attack.

1076
01:14:57,608 --> 01:14:58,802
l got down from bike and
started walking fast,

1077
01:14:59,043 --> 01:15:00,271
l felt someone was
following me.

1078
01:15:00,744 --> 01:15:01,733
Suddenly l turned back,

1079
01:15:01,946 --> 01:15:03,243
l saw my friend
standing opposite to me.

1080
01:15:03,647 --> 01:15:04,807
l was surprised to see him,
and asked him, why are you here?

1081
01:15:07,084 --> 01:15:07,675
He said l'm staying here
only from past few days.

1082
01:15:08,419 --> 01:15:10,853
To get rid of fear
l asked him a cigarette.

1083
01:15:11,088 --> 01:15:12,612
He took out a cigarette from
his ear and gave me.

1084
01:15:13,324 --> 01:15:14,621
l said l don't have
a match box.

1085
01:15:14,892 --> 01:15:16,723
he said no problem and
showed his pointing finger.

1086
01:15:17,228 --> 01:15:18,627
There was a fire on
the tip of his finger.

1087
01:15:21,665 --> 01:15:23,792
padhu, l got afraid and
tried to look at his legs.

1088
01:15:24,235 --> 01:15:26,726
l saw his legs in the light
of burning pyres.

1089
01:15:26,904 --> 01:15:29,634
Every thing was normal but his feet
were facing other side.

1090
01:15:34,245 --> 01:15:35,303
Bloody fool wants to
hear stories.

1091
01:15:46,056 --> 01:15:51,016
Lord Anjaneya protect us.

1092
01:16:16,620 --> 01:16:39,466


1093
01:16:40,677 --> 01:16:43,669
My lover's beauty is
like tender young leaf.

1094
01:16:44,014 --> 01:16:46,812
her words are little harsh.

1095
01:16:47,517 --> 01:16:50,486
Don't consider yourself as
Legendary poet Kalidas.

1096
01:16:50,787 --> 01:16:53,654
Don't follow me.

1097
01:16:54,958 --> 01:16:57,859
How long do we've to keep fighting?

1098
01:16:58,495 --> 01:17:01,362
Am l not in troubles
because of you?

1099
01:17:01,832 --> 01:17:04,460
How soft you are
in anger too

1100
01:17:39,236 --> 01:17:40,669
You complain that l've
opened my heart.

1101
01:17:40,904 --> 01:17:42,462
But never give a serious
thought about it.

1102
01:17:42,706 --> 01:17:44,765
Am l not the only way to you?

1103
01:17:46,042 --> 01:17:47,600
You claim to have
been born for me,

1104
01:17:47,811 --> 01:17:49,142
and say you'll die for me.

1105
01:17:49,579 --> 01:17:51,547
What right do you've on me?

1106
01:17:52,983 --> 01:17:56,214
lf you ask l'll give my life.
why don't you believe me?

1107
01:17:56,586 --> 01:17:59,453
Why do you refuse and
keep away from you?

1108
01:17:59,923 --> 01:18:06,158
Don't say again and again same thing
don't torture and kill me.

1109
01:18:37,360 --> 01:18:38,793
When l come near,
you ask me to go away.

1110
01:18:39,029 --> 01:18:40,553
When l go away,
you get scared.

1111
01:18:40,831 --> 01:18:42,765
How am to cope up with this?

1112
01:18:44,167 --> 01:18:47,261
You always go against me.
lf l say right, you say left.

1113
01:18:47,704 --> 01:18:49,569
lt's always trouble with you.

1114
01:18:51,107 --> 01:18:54,565
Why are you running
away from me?

1115
01:18:54,711 --> 01:18:57,680
Give me yourself to me to bear you.

1116
01:18:58,048 --> 01:19:01,074
Charming with your
mesmerizing words

1117
01:19:01,318 --> 01:19:04,287
You slowly pulled me
towards you.

1118
01:19:04,788 --> 01:19:44,792


1119
01:19:48,932 --> 01:19:49,830
where's Padhu?

1120
01:19:50,066 --> 01:19:51,328
he hasn't come back
getting the car ready.

1121
01:19:51,601 --> 01:19:54,001
He'll not come unable
to tolerate you.

1122
01:19:54,371 --> 01:19:55,998
Where will he go?
He come back.

1123
01:19:56,373 --> 01:19:56,998
He'll never come back.

1124
01:19:57,474 --> 01:19:59,669
That's why l picked his
purse suspecting it.

1125
01:20:00,944 --> 01:20:03,913
did you steal?
-Yes, it's all your grace.

1126
01:20:04,381 --> 01:20:05,848
Yesterday l fought
today l stole.

1127
01:20:06,049 --> 01:20:07,016
Don't know what will
l do tomorrow?

1128
01:20:09,719 --> 01:20:10,515
What are you looking at?

1129
01:20:11,388 --> 01:20:14,516
Will you eat alone shamelessly?
won't you offer others?

1130
01:20:14,724 --> 01:20:16,692
You said you'll not eat defiled things
-That was yesterday.

1131
01:20:17,861 --> 01:20:19,726
lf you join politics
everyone will quit.

1132
01:20:23,533 --> 01:20:24,431
Keeping another one in pocket.

1133
01:20:25,001 --> 01:20:26,764
they said eating carrots will
increase your blood content.

1134
01:20:27,003 --> 01:20:28,402
But now l found
it's for others

1135
01:20:30,774 --> 01:20:32,833
How long do we've to walk?
-Just a kilometer.

1136
01:20:33,777 --> 01:20:35,574
That's all. -After that
you'll get used to it.

1137
01:20:40,450 --> 01:20:40,848
Come, let's cross.

1138
01:20:42,118 --> 01:20:43,085
l'll not get into water.

1139
01:20:44,554 --> 01:20:45,521
My slippers will get wet.

1140
01:20:45,889 --> 01:20:47,083
Then, give it to me.
l'll carry it.

1141
01:20:47,557 --> 01:20:48,581
l can't walk barefoot.

1142
01:20:56,499 --> 01:20:57,693
it's nice.

1143
01:20:57,934 --> 01:20:59,799
lt'll be nice to you but
l'm feeling the presure.

1144
01:21:01,671 --> 01:21:03,036
Can't you carry properly?

1145
01:21:03,273 --> 01:21:06,640
Am l a Professional coolie?
You are weighing like a bull.

1146
01:21:06,843 --> 01:21:07,707
Are you calling me a bull?

1147
01:21:07,944 --> 01:21:09,138
Okay, l'll call a bull
as Maleeshwari.

1148
01:21:09,512 --> 01:21:10,171
Shut up boy.

1149
01:21:10,747 --> 01:21:12,647
Calling me informally.
-l'll call you like that only.

1150
01:21:12,849 --> 01:21:13,838
'Unmarried' prasad!

1151
01:21:14,517 --> 01:21:15,040
Hold this.

1152
01:21:16,219 --> 01:21:16,810
This will not do.

1153
01:21:18,855 --> 01:21:20,482
lf you say that again,
l'll kill you, becareful.

1154
01:21:22,759 --> 01:21:23,521
l've vulcanized the tyre.

1155
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:25,694

How much? -Rs.1200

1160
01:21:37,807 --> 01:21:40,537
That's all. Looks like petrol prices
have fallen drastically. -Yes sir.

Give me a rupee.
-Can't you ask softly?

1166

Do l've to beg and fall at
your feet for a rupee?

1167
01:22:08,304 --> 01:22:09,931
lt's enought if you
don't hold my collar.

1168
01:22:16,646 --> 01:22:17,977
Don't move.
-Leave me.

Suddenly l felt
l was fainting.

1180
01:23:17,874 --> 01:23:19,102
When l opened my eyes,
l was here.

1181
01:23:19,342 --> 01:23:21,071
This is a lie
Shall we talk truth?

1182
01:23:21,344 --> 01:23:23,744
Hating you for last
night's incident,

1183
01:23:24,180 --> 01:23:26,444
You told me to tell the truth,
didn't you? -Go ahead.

1184
01:23:26,883 --> 01:23:29,078
l came here to
escape from you.

1185
01:23:29,486 --> 01:23:32,319
l got the tyre repaired and
filled with petrol tank,

1186
01:23:32,555 --> 01:23:33,749
l had a soft drink also.

1187
01:23:34,124 --> 01:23:36,115
l found my purse missing
after drinking it.

1188
01:23:36,359 --> 01:23:38,259
l met the manager immediately.

1189
01:23:38,828 --> 01:23:40,853
l got scared on seeing his anger.
-Next?

1190
01:23:41,164 --> 01:23:43,029
l understood my mistake
and setting his due.

1191
01:23:43,266 --> 01:23:45,496
l've understood the true
value of a purse.

1192
01:23:46,169 --> 01:23:46,965
Now l remember when
you said purse.

1193
01:23:47,337 --> 01:23:49,464
l found this purse last night
near the haystack. ls it yours?

1194
01:23:52,075 --> 01:23:53,372
This is a lie.
Tell me the truth.

1195
01:23:53,943 --> 01:23:55,968
l took it fearing
you might lose it.

1196
01:23:57,347 --> 01:24:00,475
No, no. no sir.
How many cars l had cleaned?

1197
01:24:02,085 --> 01:24:03,245
What's all his? -Bill.

1198
01:24:05,421 --> 01:24:06,388
What's this for?-Money.

1199
01:24:07,290 --> 01:24:08,814
She's going away casually.

1200
01:24:13,563 --> 01:24:16,498
l've to rob a bank to maintain
you, not work there.

1201
01:24:19,235 --> 01:24:20,293
How come you've
grown thin Padhu?

1202
01:24:20,470 --> 01:24:22,028
Do you've to work if your
purse is missing?

1203
01:24:22,238 --> 01:24:23,034
Can't you give away
your gold chain?

1204
01:24:24,574 --> 01:24:26,974
Can't you ask him to take
back his petrol?

1205
01:24:27,143 --> 01:24:29,304
lf l was so clever
why would l give you a lift?

1206
01:24:34,150 --> 01:24:34,582
Come quickly we're getting late.
wait...coming.

1207
01:24:35,018 --> 01:24:38,317
Ordering like a Princess...
l'm also getting late.

1208
01:24:44,194 --> 01:24:45,456
Padhu, pull over the car.
-why?

1209
01:24:45,728 --> 01:24:46,990
Stop, when she's asking you.

1210
01:24:49,966 --> 01:24:51,092
You go. there.

1211
01:24:52,302 --> 01:24:54,031
Try to understand.
women can't say everything.

1212
01:24:54,304 --> 01:24:56,101
Even men can't say anything
before you.-what?

1213
01:24:56,539 --> 01:24:57,631
Boy, get me 2 teas please.

1214
01:24:59,209 --> 01:25:00,972
Can l ask you a thing
if you don't mind?

1215
01:25:02,545 --> 01:25:03,944
Who is Maleeshwari to you?

1216
01:25:06,082 --> 01:25:07,106
She's my future wife.

1217
01:25:08,551 --> 01:25:11,042
You are lucky to find
a beautiful girl.

1218
01:25:11,654 --> 01:25:14,953
l didn't find her, she found me.
-Really? -Yes.

1219
01:25:16,659 --> 01:25:17,648
Knowing well l'll be in
library everyday.

1220
01:25:18,127 --> 01:25:19,992
She used to come to library
at 5 correctly.

1221
01:25:20,363 --> 01:25:22,388
Once finding library closed,
she came to my house.

1222
01:25:22,799 --> 01:25:24,699
Later she came to
my bank directly.

1223
01:25:25,368 --> 01:25:27,700
She came to my friend's
birthday party on a ship.

1224
01:25:29,038 --> 01:25:30,027
l had to gave in at last.

1225
01:25:30,473 --> 01:25:34,671
l was surprises at her perseverance.
-l'm also surprised.

1226
01:25:35,144 --> 01:25:37,339
What's so great in you that
made her chase you?

1227
01:25:39,382 --> 01:25:41,441
Sir, Maleeshwari is going
away in that auto.

1228
01:25:43,052 --> 01:25:45,020
She'll not take a step
also without me.

1229
01:25:46,155 --> 01:25:48,453
Sir, madam who went in that
auto gave this to you.

1230
01:25:50,860 --> 01:25:53,021
Thanks for giving lift
to Hyderabad and to,

1231
01:25:53,263 --> 01:25:55,197
'Unmarried' Prasad for
accompanying me.

1232
01:25:55,665 --> 01:25:57,565
Don't search for me.
-maleeshwari.

1233
01:26:05,208 --> 01:26:07,233
Shall l drop you in Jubilee
Hills Bus station?- why?

1234
01:26:08,211 --> 01:26:09,235
You'll get bus
to go back to vizag.

1235
01:26:09,545 --> 01:26:11,308
Will l go away in bus seeing
her go away in a auto?

1236
01:26:11,514 --> 01:26:13,379
Maleeshwari is my life.

1237
01:26:13,549 --> 01:26:15,244
l'll not have a drop of
water till l find her.

1238
01:26:17,453 --> 01:26:19,421
No sugar in tea.
Get me sugar please.

1239
01:26:21,691 --> 01:26:23,750
How can you find a girl
in such a large city?

1240
01:26:27,730 --> 01:26:30,631
This is phone bill, a call Maleeshwari
made to Hyderabad.

1241
01:26:30,867 --> 01:26:32,300
Let's find the address
from this number.

1242
01:26:33,269 --> 01:26:34,497
You are very clever.

1243
01:26:34,737 --> 01:26:35,567
Tell me the truth.

1244
01:26:36,506 --> 01:26:37,803
Getting rid of you is
very difficult

1245
01:27:01,230 --> 01:27:01,662
Uncle

1246
01:27:02,699 --> 01:27:04,667
Do you suspect anyone
in vizag?

1247
01:27:04,901 --> 01:27:07,529
No uncle, nobody knows
about Maleeshwari there

1248
01:27:08,004 --> 01:27:10,234
Who told you that she's
going to Hyderabad?

1249
01:27:10,473 --> 01:27:12,703
l told about a bank employee Prasad
saying Maleeshwari, didn't l?

1250
01:27:12,942 --> 01:27:15,308
His office peon informed me.
So l came here immediately.

1251
01:27:15,478 --> 01:27:17,378
why are you still pondering?

1252
01:27:17,580 --> 01:27:18,877
Let's file a case against
Bhavani Shankar

1253
01:27:19,248 --> 01:27:21,716
lf we file a case now,
till the case is settled.

1254
01:27:21,951 --> 01:27:25,250
Court will grant a stay on
transferring the property.

1255
01:27:25,421 --> 01:27:27,252
You mean we've to escape
if he plans an attack.

1256
01:27:27,490 --> 01:27:29,788
And get killed if caught.
Even then we mustn't squeal.

1257
01:27:29,926 --> 01:27:31,393
lf we do it'll be heard by
the law of court.

1258
01:27:31,627 --> 01:27:32,889
ls that all you say?
-No sir.

1259
01:27:33,296 --> 01:27:33,728
What no sir?

1260
01:27:33,963 --> 01:27:36,363
we are committing a mistake by
hiding Maleeshwari from public.

1261
01:27:36,866 --> 01:27:40,632
What she needs now is
publicity not security.

1262
01:27:41,871 --> 01:27:44,840
That's why let's arrange a
press conference.- After that.

1263
01:27:45,408 --> 01:27:46,375
Let's announce about
the property.

1264
01:27:46,876 --> 01:27:49,310
Let's announce about
the property.

1265
01:27:49,545 --> 01:27:51,945
And reveal the assassination
attempts on her.

1266
01:27:52,648 --> 01:27:54,172
But tell them you don't know
about the killer's identity.

1267
01:27:55,418 --> 01:27:58,046
They'll understand and
take a break.

1268
01:27:58,755 --> 01:28:00,848
This is good idea uncle.
-This will definitely work out.

1269
01:28:01,090 --> 01:28:02,853
Even if Maleeshwari slips,

1270
01:28:05,361 --> 01:28:07,522
people will decide it's handiwork
of bhavani shankar.

1271
01:28:14,470 --> 01:28:16,563
Arrange a press meet.

1272
01:28:16,806 --> 01:28:20,105
May be we are at wrong address.
-No, we are at correct address.

1273
01:28:21,043 --> 01:28:23,841
You asked me to find the address.
l found it l'll take leave now.

1274
01:28:24,147 --> 01:28:24,909
why are you scared?

1275
01:28:25,148 --> 01:28:26,115
Will they beat or
kill us if we enter?

1276
01:28:26,816 --> 01:28:28,340
l'll stay here only.
You go in and find out.

1277
01:28:29,619 --> 01:28:31,052
Let's go together.

1278
01:28:31,387 --> 01:28:33,048
What if anyone steals your vehicle.
-lt's insured, but l'm not,

1279
01:28:36,859 --> 01:28:39,350
Keep those chairs there.
why don't you understand?

1280
01:28:39,529 --> 01:28:40,962
Come on get going.

1281
01:28:41,764 --> 01:28:43,356
Keep that on it.
-One minute. -Do it.

1282
01:28:43,866 --> 01:28:45,060
Hold this mike for a minute.

1283
01:28:47,870 --> 01:28:48,427
why did you call me sir?

1284
01:28:48,671 --> 01:28:49,831
Get my cigarette
pack from upstairs.

1285
01:28:53,676 --> 01:28:54,438
Get lighter.

1286
01:28:57,213 --> 01:28:58,180
Who'll bring the ash tray?

1287
01:29:08,024 --> 01:29:09,992
Give me that ash tray.
-who wants it?

1288
01:29:10,593 --> 01:29:11,457
l've a husband, haven't l?

1289
01:29:11,727 --> 01:29:14,423
Expecting he'll ask l was carrying
cigarette & lighter in pocket.

1290
01:29:14,597 --> 01:29:16,030
l forgot ash tray and
he asked that only.

1291
01:29:17,733 --> 01:29:20,668
Like 'Bharata Ratna' award, he should
be given 'King of lazy'

1292
01:29:21,604 --> 01:29:22,502
Even that will be a waste,

1293
01:29:22,738 --> 01:29:24,899
He'll feel lazy to go
and forego it. My fate.

1294
01:29:29,078 --> 01:29:31,512
Should l be awarded
as 'King of Lazy'?

1295
01:29:31,848 --> 01:29:33,816
l'll remove your limbs
after the conference.

1296
01:29:34,083 --> 01:29:35,641
How could you hear all this?

1297
01:29:38,287 --> 01:29:40,482
Where's the mike?
where did you go away?

1298
01:29:41,757 --> 01:29:43,520
You go to the gate...stop.

1299
01:29:44,327 --> 01:29:46,522
What'll you do there?
Don't allow everyone inside?

1300
01:29:46,729 --> 01:29:48,094
Find out from which newspaper
and then send them in. Go.

1301
01:29:48,898 --> 01:29:49,489
Go.

1302
01:29:53,269 --> 01:29:54,201
Don't be afraid.

1303
01:29:58,908 --> 01:30:01,240
Which newspaper?
-'Eenadu'.

1304
01:30:06,682 --> 01:30:07,546
Come quickly.

1305
01:30:08,251 --> 01:30:10,981
May be they wouldn't have allowed if
we bought English paper. -Joke?

1306
01:30:17,960 --> 01:30:19,985
What would she be doing
in such a big house?

1307
01:30:20,963 --> 01:30:23,261
Teaching little children
for taking care of old

1308
01:30:23,633 --> 01:30:25,157
She must be do something
for her livelihood.

1309
01:30:25,401 --> 01:30:27,699
You must marry
and give her a life.

1310
01:30:29,205 --> 01:30:31,935
Let her come before me,
l'll remove all her difficulties.

1311
01:30:38,314 --> 01:30:40,282
You know about
Mirzapur Princely state.

1312
01:30:41,083 --> 01:30:45,281
You know a legal battle for property
is going on for 20 years.

1313
01:30:45,755 --> 01:30:49,657
To introduce the legal heir
of the property to you,

1314
01:30:49,892 --> 01:30:50,984
This press meet has been arranged.

1315
01:32:18,180 --> 01:32:19,147
Come let's go.

1316
01:32:37,466 --> 01:32:38,296
How nicely she cheated you?

1317
01:32:38,901 --> 01:32:41,233
She gave a brilliant performance
as poor girl though she was rich.

1318
01:32:42,071 --> 01:32:42,867
That's not cheating.

1319
01:32:43,472 --> 01:32:45,872
Though she's so rich,
she moved with us normally.

1320
01:32:46,342 --> 01:32:47,240
That's her greatness.

1321
01:32:47,476 --> 01:32:49,307
But still isn't it wrong to lie?

1322
01:32:49,912 --> 01:32:51,106
Maleeshwari didn't lie,

1323
01:32:52,148 --> 01:32:55,117
l lied to you that she loves me.

1324
01:32:56,352 --> 01:32:58,445
But your love for her
is true, isn't it?

1325
01:32:59,255 --> 01:33:03,885
Wrong, we must wish to see Taj Mahal.
we shouldn't wish to reside in it.

1326
01:33:18,240 --> 01:33:20,037
What's the meaning of this?

1327
01:33:20,309 --> 01:33:22,800
To publicize us as their enemies

1328
01:33:23,245 --> 01:33:25,042
What's their gain?

1329
01:33:26,082 --> 01:33:28,277
lf a rat announces there's
a cat in my house.

1330
01:33:28,517 --> 01:33:30,815
lf the rat dies, everyone will
suspect the cat.

1331
01:33:31,787 --> 01:33:33,721
You mean us.

1332
01:33:34,523 --> 01:33:35,490
What should the cat do now?

1333
01:33:36,325 --> 01:33:38,555
Should it stop eating
non-vegetarian food?- No need.

1334
01:33:39,095 --> 01:33:41,222
lnstead of killing openly,
You can poison her to death.

1335
01:33:41,831 --> 01:33:45,733
So, you say knife must be ours
but not our hands.

1336
01:33:49,705 --> 01:33:53,334
We mustn't be blamed
Maleeshwari must die.

1337
01:33:54,577 --> 01:33:59,537
Bobby, buy a organdy sari
a cotton blouse for this knife. -why?

1338
01:34:00,716 --> 01:34:01,341
Weather report

1339
01:34:07,389 --> 01:34:08,617
Cyclone warning

1340
01:34:09,725 --> 01:34:12,285
A low depression has formed
in bay of bangali.

1341
01:34:13,629 --> 01:34:16,621
lt may strike the
coast at any time.

1342
01:34:29,445 --> 01:34:29,843
Leave me.

1343
01:34:39,455 --> 01:34:42,424
l wished your welfare only.

1344
01:34:42,658 --> 01:34:49,427

This is the fate of heart.

1347
01:34:56,505 --> 01:34:58,735
This is the fate of man's life.

1348
01:35:00,509 --> 01:35:04,570
A man's heart will never
be happy. - l'll stop it.

1349
01:35:10,853 --> 01:35:12,753
You are always happy and

l'm not able to see you sad.

1351

1353
01:35:25,434 --> 01:35:26,492
Don't you feel like going back.

1354
01:35:27,102 --> 01:35:28,296
lnitally you'll feel like that only.

1355
01:35:28,571 --> 01:35:29,970
Once you get down 2 steps,
you'll get used to it.

1356
01:35:30,506 --> 01:35:30,995

She's sick she has sent her

Bring it quickly.

1386
01:37:35,597 --> 01:37:36,621
Why a flower vase here?

1387
01:37:45,174 --> 01:37:46,232
They don't know where
a vase should be.

1388
01:37:54,049 --> 01:37:55,277
This is more lazy than me.

1389
01:38:01,056 --> 01:38:03,251
Throwing down Rs.1000 worth pant
for Rs.10 worth flowers

1390
01:38:03,959 --> 01:38:05,017
They don't have any sense.

1391
01:38:18,774 --> 01:38:20,537
You? -Forgot me so quickly.

1392
01:38:20,776 --> 01:38:22,801
who allowed you inside?
-who will allow me?

1393
01:38:23,012 --> 01:38:25,003
Like drought to Anantapur and
power cut to Andhra Pradesh,

1394
01:38:25,447 --> 01:38:26,345
l've come on my own.

1395
01:38:26,582 --> 01:38:28,812
lf my grandpa comes
to know, he'll kill you.

1396
01:38:29,018 --> 01:38:30,986
Your grandpa BEGGED ME TO
STAY HERE, YOU KNOW THAT?

1397
01:38:31,453 --> 01:38:31,976
You're lying.

1398
01:38:32,454 --> 01:38:34,547
That's the boon given to you
by god, l can't lie.

1399
01:38:35,691 --> 01:38:37,818
Did l say anything wrong?
Did you ever tell one truth?

1400
01:38:37,926 --> 01:38:39,484
Your name is a lie.
Your plan is a lie.

1401
01:38:39,728 --> 01:38:41,593
Your phone number is a lie
Your claming orphan is a lie.

1402
01:38:41,830 --> 01:38:43,024
Did you tell truth any time?

1403
01:38:43,499 --> 01:38:44,659
Didn't you lie about your
brother & sister-in-law?

1404
01:38:44,967 --> 01:38:47,595
Whenever l lied,
it was for good only.

1405
01:38:47,836 --> 01:38:48,928
Unable to bear your
criminal intelligence,

1406
01:38:49,171 --> 01:38:50,729
No body dared to give his
daughter in marriage to you.

1407
01:38:53,509 --> 01:38:54,737
You can talk about anything.

1408
01:38:54,977 --> 01:38:57,036
But never talk about my marriage,
you'll lose your respect.

1409
01:38:57,846 --> 01:38:59,040
What will you do?
-why are you coming on me?

1410
01:38:59,415 --> 01:38:59,938
What'll you do?

1411
01:39:01,183 --> 01:39:04,812
Hey' Unmarried' Prasad, this is not
your Vizag. This is my place.

1412
01:39:05,421 --> 01:39:07,048
l'll get you lynched
here with my men.

1413
01:39:07,523 --> 01:39:09,753
Bloody Vamp!
l saved you from rowdies.

1414
01:39:09,992 --> 01:39:11,391
Will you get me
beated up by rowdies?

1415
01:39:12,227 --> 01:39:13,956
Shut up and wear your pant.

1416
01:39:15,798 --> 01:39:18,426
How much you'd teased me?
l'll take revenge.

1417
01:39:21,036 --> 01:39:24,096
You're not Maleeshwari.
You should've been named Ghost.

1418
01:39:26,708 --> 01:39:27,868
Food is ready.
-Bring it here.

1419
01:39:28,243 --> 01:39:29,676
No way, we've to go.

1420
01:39:30,045 --> 01:39:31,876
Rule or request? -Order.

1421
01:39:50,699 --> 01:39:51,529
How long do we've
to go further?

1422
01:39:51,767 --> 01:39:54,235
l don't like you calling
me like that. -Okay boy.

1423
01:40:00,109 --> 01:40:02,543
oh God! This looks like
not a walk to eat.

1424
01:40:02,778 --> 01:40:04,075
But a walk to
digest food eaten

1425
01:40:08,884 --> 01:40:09,612
Coming.

1426
01:40:14,556 --> 01:40:15,022
Lift?

1427
01:40:33,775 --> 01:40:35,242
Nice! Maleeshwari's mother?

1428
01:40:39,381 --> 01:40:40,075
l can't walk any further.

1429
01:40:43,385 --> 01:40:45,910
How far to go man?

1430
01:40:47,789 --> 01:40:48,346
This is dining hall.

1431
01:40:49,791 --> 01:40:51,816
l never felt so happy on
seeing god in Tirupathi also.

1432
01:40:52,060 --> 01:40:52,583
Open the door.

1433
01:41:06,241 --> 01:41:06,730
This way.

1434
01:41:20,022 --> 01:41:21,819
Pulse gravy? -Ghee?

1435
01:41:22,024 --> 01:41:23,082
Yes.-where?

1436
01:41:23,926 --> 01:41:24,654
lt's on the other end.

1437
01:41:25,294 --> 01:41:26,886
No need now l'll have it
tomorrow when l sit there.

1438
01:41:27,162 --> 01:41:28,220
l'll tell you a number
connect me a call.

1439
01:41:31,300 --> 01:41:32,927

Are you fine Prasad?
-Do you know a thing brother?

1443
01:41:46,181 --> 01:41:47,375
Maleeshwari is not a maid
servant with Murthys.

1444
01:41:47,749 --> 01:41:48,408
She's a Princes of Mirzapur.

1445
01:41:48,850 --> 01:41:50,374
Yes, l read it in newspaper.

1446
01:41:50,752 --> 01:41:51,946
l'm now in her palace only.

1447
01:41:52,321 --> 01:41:53,879
They gave me a room.

1448
01:41:54,089 --> 01:41:55,954
Tub in the bathroom
A/c in bedroom,

1449
01:41:56,191 --> 01:41:59,388
Phone in dining room.
A servant to massage me.

1450
01:41:59,895 --> 01:42:00,953
You've to see the cot

1451
01:42:01,230 --> 01:42:03,130
You don't feel like sleeping
on it if you see.

1452
01:42:03,365 --> 01:42:04,389
lf you sleep you won't feel
like coming out of it.

1453
01:42:04,900 --> 01:42:05,423
Are they taking care of
you so nicely?

1454
01:42:05,901 --> 01:42:07,766
l'm the king here, brother.

1455
01:42:08,036 --> 01:42:09,196
Not a wastrel.
what do you say?

1456
01:42:10,038 --> 01:42:11,938
How are sister-in-law and Dolly?

1457
01:42:12,140 --> 01:42:12,799
They are fine.

1458
01:42:13,041 --> 01:42:15,202
Tell sister-in-law to
clean by bike

1459
01:42:17,479 --> 01:42:19,447
She's not just wiping it clean,
in fact she's washing it daily.

1460
01:42:20,582 --> 01:42:23,016
Dolly is worried about you.
Talk to her.

1461
01:42:24,586 --> 01:42:25,018
Uncle

1462
01:42:25,254 --> 01:42:27,119
why are you worried dear?
l'll come back in a week.

1463
01:42:27,389 --> 01:42:30,358
Why did then mummy say
you'll never come back?

1464
01:42:31,159 --> 01:42:33,491
and we can live happily.

1465
01:42:36,298 --> 01:42:38,789
Rich people can never understand
middle class sentiments.

1466
01:42:41,637 --> 01:42:43,502
l think the way you addressed
me earlier is better.

1467
01:42:43,872 --> 01:42:45,271
Continue with it. Okay.

1468
01:42:45,574 --> 01:42:47,508
Come, let's go. lt's late night.

You carry on sir. l've work.

1470
01:42:49,645 --> 01:42:50,543
Do you remember the way back?

1471
01:42:51,313 --> 01:42:53,281
lf l see once l'll not forget
even after 10 years.

1472
01:42:53,649 --> 01:42:55,947
Sir...not that side...this way.

1473
01:42:59,321 --> 01:43:00,185
Remambers it seems?

1474
01:43:31,053 --> 01:43:31,917
l thought it was any bedroom.

1475
01:43:37,726 --> 01:43:39,921
Finding all the doors similar
l got little confused.

1476
01:43:41,229 --> 01:43:42,253
Can you guide me to my room?

1477
01:43:47,002 --> 01:43:48,936
What work do you've in that room
after Maleeshwari has slept?

1478
01:43:50,439 --> 01:43:53,306
Why are you silent?

1479
01:43:57,112 --> 01:44:00,343
Balu talks more and work less
But you're not like him.

1480
01:44:00,582 --> 01:44:04,018
You talk less and work less.
You are very dangerous.

1481
01:44:06,188 --> 01:44:06,984
Oh ! This one.

1482
01:44:13,395 --> 01:44:14,327
Your personality is good.

1483
01:44:14,730 --> 01:44:15,697
But you'll look like
a girl if you smile.

1484
01:44:16,164 --> 01:44:17,222
Practice to smile
from tomorrow.

1485
01:44:21,837 --> 01:44:23,270
Snoopy come. come.

1486
01:44:23,505 --> 01:44:25,200
lf you touch itis head.
lt'll bite you.

1487
01:44:25,407 --> 01:44:26,135
Mind your work.

1488
01:44:50,565 --> 01:44:51,725
Wrong.
-lt's not working.

1489
01:44:53,235 --> 01:44:54,725
Who are you?
-Venkatesh. -You mean?

1490
01:44:55,137 --> 01:44:56,798
Your inner soul.
-l don't care.

1491
01:44:57,139 --> 01:44:58,470
lsn't it sin to see
a girl swimming?

1492
01:44:58,707 --> 01:45:00,607
No, because she's
not seeing you.

1493
01:45:01,476 --> 01:45:03,341
l'm not able to convince myself.
Mad boy.

1494
01:45:03,578 --> 01:45:06,547
You are not seeing the girl.
You are seeing the far away building.

1495
01:45:06,915 --> 01:45:08,815
She has come in
between, that's all.

1496
01:45:09,718 --> 01:45:11,481
No, l'm seeing her only

1497
01:45:11,720 --> 01:45:13,688
Look at her from top to bottom.

1498
01:45:14,156 --> 01:45:15,487
But see that nobody sees you.

1499
01:45:15,724 --> 01:45:17,214
That's important, bye.

1500
01:45:39,481 --> 01:45:56,229


1501
01:45:57,599 --> 01:46:01,433
With her sultry she has
pierced a rose thron in my heart

1502
01:46:01,670 --> 01:46:04,400
Don't charm me, my dear.

1503
01:46:05,774 --> 01:46:09,574
Oh God! lf l get charmed
and arrested by your eyes.

1504
01:46:09,778 --> 01:46:12,406
l can't wriggle out
my self free.

1505
01:46:14,015 --> 01:46:17,917
Do you've to be so sexy
to break my penance?

1506
01:46:18,220 --> 01:46:21,781
Do you've to see so desirously
to incite passion in me?

1507
01:46:22,023 --> 01:46:24,651
Dear, you're a mischief arrow
aimed at me by cupid

1508
01:46:25,894 --> 01:46:29,762
Won't my sensuous heart
get shattered when you appear?

1509
01:47:02,998 --> 01:47:06,661
Your fiery beauty is lighting
fire to chill water.

01:48:32,887 --> 01:48:37,347
Do you've to eat me alive to
kindle passion in me?

01:48:37,525 --> 01:48:40,050
Come to relieve me
from my youthful problem.

01:49:43,958 --> 01:49:45,255

l didn't do anything
it only tried to kill me.

1529
01:50:17,125 --> 01:50:18,353
Do you've problems

1530
01:50:18,793 --> 01:50:22,024

Till now l was scared of dogs.

1531
01:50:22,263 --> 01:50:23,355
But Now l hate after
seeing this dog.

1532
01:50:23,798 --> 01:50:24,822
l brought your clothes.
How are you sir?

1533
01:50:25,033 --> 01:50:25,692
Can't you see me?

1534

What's your problem?

1535
01:50:28,970 --> 01:50:29,664
with a dog?

1536
01:50:30,505 --> 01:50:31,870
we must love dogs.

1537
01:50:36,311 --> 01:50:36,936

l too feel irritated
when l see him.

1541
01:50:48,150 --> 01:50:49,777
What's wrong if it
too feels the same?

1542
01:50:53,255 --> 01:50:54,222
Leave him.

1543
01:50:57,927 --> 01:50:58,951
lt might kill him.

1544
01:51:01,197 --> 01:51:03,495
why are you creating a ruckus
they both are playing a fun game.

1545
01:51:03,866 --> 01:51:04,890
lt's not playing. lt's hunting.

1546
01:51:18,447 --> 01:51:19,505
lt'll bite.

1547
01:51:32,915 --> 01:51:33,540
How did it happen?

1548
01:51:33,916 --> 01:51:35,110
lf feel down from the window

1549
01:51:36,051 --> 01:51:37,245
Did it die falling
from a window?

1550
01:51:37,520 --> 01:51:38,953
The window was on
the second floor.

1551
01:51:42,525 --> 01:51:45,085
What a great dog!
lt never barked.

1552
01:51:45,294 --> 01:51:46,420
lt used to bite now and then.

1553
01:51:48,964 --> 01:51:52,263
What a nice dog!
lt never bite once.

1554
01:51:54,403 --> 01:51:56,963
Most importantly it's mouth and
the saliva it let out.

1555
01:51:58,207 --> 01:52:01,267
God! lf there's a separate
heaven for dogs,

1556
01:52:01,544 --> 01:52:02,602
Let this dog also be
given a place there.

1557
01:52:02,978 --> 01:52:04,172
On this auspicious occasion,

1558
01:52:04,413 --> 01:52:08,110

marble grave for it.

01:52:11,253 --> 01:52:13,380
For me? - No, to the dog.

01:52:47,523 --> 01:52:48,455

One l washed & put it to dry in sun.

1574
01:53:21,390 --> 01:53:22,789
Another one?
-Dog tore it yesterday.

Did you note that truck's number?
-No sir.

1588

Do you suspect anyone?

1589
01:55:15,371 --> 01:55:15,837
No

1590
01:55:19,375 --> 01:55:22,572
we both know it is
not an accident.

1591
01:55:23,379 --> 01:55:28,009
Take my advice and talk to
Bhavani Shankar & settle the issue.

1592
01:55:28,650 --> 01:55:30,015
Or else this will take a heavy toll.

1593
01:55:31,987 --> 01:55:32,817
l'll take leave.

1594
01:55:34,456 --> 01:55:34,888
Okay

1595
01:55:36,859 --> 01:55:38,952
Let's talk to him
as he advices.

1596
01:55:39,194 --> 01:55:41,719
Talk to him? lt's a sin to
see his face also.

1597
01:55:41,997 --> 01:55:42,827
nasty man !

1598
01:55:47,136 --> 01:55:48,626

Drink it and go to sleep.

01:55:48,871 --> 01:55:50,429
l'll go home and send lunch.

1600
01:56:04,653 --> 01:56:05,119
Keep it there.

Doctor told you to take it now.

1602

You'll feel tried if you delay.
-Don't irritate me please.

1603
01:56:19,501 --> 01:56:21,025
Am l a little girl?
Don't l know?

1604
01:56:29,178 --> 01:56:30,577
You should've strength
at least scold me.

1605
01:56:37,719 --> 01:56:39,812
l've taken it, haven't l?
why are you still here? Go away.

1606
01:56:50,799 --> 01:56:52,858
l was little angry so...
-No problem.

1607
01:57:02,244 --> 01:57:03,973
Government should declare
a holiday today -why?

1608
01:57:04,680 --> 01:57:06,204
Every time l say sorry
when you scold ,me.

1609
01:57:06,582 --> 01:57:08,709
First time you've said sorry
after scolding me.

1610
01:57:21,196 --> 01:57:22,288
Who is Bhavani Shankar?

1611
01:57:26,068 --> 01:57:27,933
Won't you read newspaper everyday?

1612
01:57:28,670 --> 01:57:31,104
Little autos are killing

1613
01:57:34,977 --> 01:57:36,604
who are you the license?

1614
01:57:39,748 --> 01:57:42,774
Let's kill people without evidence.
Let's build house without cement.

1615
01:57:43,018 --> 01:57:44,110
Don't give me such lousy advices.

1616
01:57:45,254 --> 01:57:47,848
Rain without lighting, death without
a cry will never happen.

1617
01:57:48,123 --> 01:57:48,987
This time...

1618
01:57:49,925 --> 01:57:51,654
Killing Maleeshwari is
my headache now

1619
01:57:52,261 --> 01:57:53,819
Your duty is to ensure
there's no case.

1620
01:57:54,696 --> 01:57:55,993
Don't poke you nose
in other things.

1621
01:57:58,700 --> 01:57:59,166
Go.

1622
01:58:03,939 --> 01:58:05,099
when are you starting
the floor work?

1623
01:58:05,807 --> 01:58:06,831
May be in 4 days.

1624
01:58:15,184 --> 01:58:16,242
lf l leave your shirt,

1625
01:58:16,752 --> 01:58:17,912
You'll fall down faster
than the lift.

1626
01:58:18,520 --> 01:58:20,454
Your head will break
hitting the ground.

1627
01:58:21,089 --> 01:58:22,181
Next your neck with crack

1628
01:58:22,524 --> 01:58:24,822
Before you know your minds limbs
are broken. You'll be dead.

1629
01:58:25,194 --> 01:58:26,388
No...don't kill me.

1630
01:58:27,763 --> 01:58:29,287

You've ulcer,

1633
01:58:32,768 --> 01:58:35,168
You'll die if you eat good food.
why do you want property?

1634
01:58:35,871 --> 01:58:37,395
lf you kill your father,
you'll get a job.

1635
01:58:37,773 --> 01:58:38,865
You'll find gold if
you kill your mother.

1636
01:58:39,107 --> 01:58:40,404
You'll get property
if you kill a girl.

1637
01:58:40,776 --> 01:58:42,175
Forget all such nasty ideas.

1638
01:58:43,545 --> 01:58:45,308
lf you touch Maleeshwari again,

1639
01:58:45,814 --> 01:58:48,783
l'll kill you so mercilessly that your son
will get scared to see your body.

1640
01:58:52,821 --> 01:58:56,257
Don't waste time on
inquiring about me,

1641
01:58:56,825 --> 01:58:57,883

1644
01:59:05,167 --> 01:59:06,134

considerations.

1645
01:59:20,415 --> 01:59:21,814
Discharged?

1646
01:59:22,317 --> 01:59:23,181
Are you the in-charge?- No.

1647
01:59:23,452 --> 01:59:24,384
why do you disturb then?

1648
01:59:28,890 --> 01:59:30,289
Every one talks but don't
know what to talk.

1649
01:59:31,893 --> 01:59:33,884
Bag, don't know where
to keep things

1650
01:59:36,665 --> 01:59:37,859
Did he get discharged
so quickly?

1651
01:59:41,336 --> 01:59:42,200
Move Move....

1652
01:59:43,672 --> 01:59:44,570
You please come...

1653
01:59:46,575 --> 01:59:48,440
Move madam is coming.
-Please come.

1654
01:59:48,677 --> 01:59:49,439
why are you over acting?

1655
01:59:50,012 --> 01:59:51,036
There are steps here. Be careful

1656
01:59:51,246 --> 01:59:53,043
Leave my hand.
Am l a patient?

1657
01:59:54,349 --> 01:59:55,316
l'll open it.

1658
01:59:56,051 --> 01:59:57,211
Here...sit.

1659
02:00:02,524 --> 02:00:04,992
Not there...go to the front.

1660
02:00:10,299 --> 02:00:10,958
Go.

1661
02:00:16,071 --> 02:00:16,594
Look at there.

1662
02:00:16,972 --> 02:00:19,634
Big names and big hospitals.
But they leave patients mid air.

1663
02:00:20,075 --> 02:00:22,043
You watch road and drive.
Maleeshwari is in the car.

1664
02:00:26,748 --> 02:00:27,646
Are you comfortable?

1665
02:00:28,684 --> 02:00:31,084
You are acting too smart.
what's the matter?

1666
02:00:31,353 --> 02:00:33,287
Nothing.- No problem...come out.

1667
02:00:33,588 --> 02:00:35,021
You mustn't get angry.-Okay.

1668
02:00:42,264 --> 02:00:44,494
what's this?
-My investment on you.

1669
02:00:46,702 --> 02:00:49,330
The expenses l incurred on you
from Vizag to hyderabad.

1670
02:00:54,142 --> 02:00:55,336
You eat in Vizag that one.

1671
02:00:57,612 --> 02:00:59,045
Flower bouquet Rs.200.

1672
02:00:59,715 --> 02:01:01,239
l bought it for your
friend's birthday.

1673
02:01:01,483 --> 02:01:02,575

1674
02:01:04,753 --> 02:01:06,186
STD bill Rs.199.

1675
02:01:06,655 --> 02:01:08,486
the phone from petrol bunk

1676
02:01:09,324 --> 02:01:12,259
l spent lavishly on you
thinking you are poor girl.

1677
02:01:12,661 --> 02:01:15,289
l came to know you're filthy rich
after coming here.

1678
02:01:15,864 --> 02:01:17,491
l mean very wealthy.

1679
02:01:19,101 --> 02:01:21,433
l wouldn't have asked.

1680
02:01:22,104 --> 02:01:23,503
But l am a little
tight financially.

1681
02:01:24,106 --> 02:01:25,573

He made a little wish.

He wants you to become
his daughter-in-law.

1745
02:08:06,007 --> 02:08:07,099
What's there to object?

1746

Any way someday our families

What are you looking at?
Seek his blessings.

1749
02:08:21,189 --> 02:08:21,917
Good luck

1750
02:08:22,524 --> 02:08:24,583

that worry also.

1752

daughter-in-law

1753
02:08:28,663 --> 02:08:30,494
They'll give lot of gold
along with her.

02:08:37,405 --> 02:08:37,962
Take it, sister-in-law.

1755
02:08:38,206 --> 02:08:39,969
No, please. Doctor has advised
not to take drinks.

1756
02:08:40,208 --> 02:08:41,106
You're too much.

1757
02:08:41,409 --> 02:08:42,171
Doctor advised me also
not to take drinks.

1758
02:08:42,410 --> 02:08:43,308
Am l not drinking?

1759
02:08:43,545 --> 02:08:46,378
Doctor advised to stop liquor
and she soft drink.

1760
02:08:51,019 --> 02:08:53,180
why are you still
making her stand?

1761
02:08:53,454 --> 02:08:56,355
She's already wet.
She might catch cold.

1762
02:08:56,791 --> 02:08:57,223
why are you watching
with a smile?

1763
02:08:58,459 --> 02:09:00,154
Take her and wipe her dry.
-All right.

1764
02:09:00,361 --> 02:09:02,659
Take her quickly.
Lest he might catch cold.

1765
02:09:14,275 --> 02:09:15,037
One minute Prasad

1767
02:09:16,811 --> 02:09:19,336
You've to sleep in Balu's room
tonight if you don't mind.

1768
02:09:20,048 --> 02:09:22,039
You see lot of guests
and commotion.

1769
02:09:22,283 --> 02:09:25,047
Moreover Bhavani is very
particular about protocals.

1770
02:09:26,421 --> 02:09:28,355
He might take it bad if
you also stay here.

1771
02:09:28,656 --> 02:09:29,554
Elderly man !

1772
02:09:30,325 --> 02:09:33,226
we've to adjust.

1773
02:09:34,095 --> 02:09:36,290

1774
02:09:36,664 --> 02:09:38,632
balu, get Prasad's bag.

1775
02:09:40,768 --> 02:09:43,566
Then...-Brother.
Any secret?- Nothing.

1776
02:09:43,872 --> 02:09:46,170
prasad wants to leave,
l'm trying to stop him.

1777
02:09:46,441 --> 02:09:49,410
Tomorrow is Maleeshwari's birthday.

1778
02:09:49,677 --> 02:09:51,770
You stayed here till now,
why are you leaving today?

1779
02:09:57,151 --> 02:10:03,454
You help my collar form them
they held my legs.

1780
02:10:04,826 --> 02:10:07,624
will l leave crores worth
property for that?

1781
02:10:08,162 --> 02:10:09,151
All that is a lie

1782
02:10:10,164 --> 02:10:11,358
Do you know the truth?

1783
02:10:12,166 --> 02:10:14,293
l'll kill malleeshwari
by tomorrow morning.

1784
02:10:21,409 --> 02:10:22,467
Foolish man

1785
02:10:22,944 --> 02:10:25,174
Like allowing Veerapan to
guard Sandalwood farm

1786
02:10:26,281 --> 02:10:27,714
They've allowed me
to enter this place.

1787
02:10:27,949 --> 02:10:30,645
Come in brother-in-law...
Food is getting cold.

1788
02:10:32,654 --> 02:10:35,145
You must be here tomorrow and
arrange everything personally.

1789
02:10:48,670 --> 02:10:49,967
Sir...no problem.
l'll carry it.

1790
02:11:09,290 --> 02:11:09,949
They are like that only.

1791
02:11:10,625 --> 02:11:11,592
Only their homes are
large & spacious

1792
02:11:12,393 --> 02:11:13,417
lnside very small and congested

1793
02:11:15,863 --> 02:11:17,626
The man who tried to
kill madam till now

1794
02:11:17,865 --> 02:11:19,264
Suddenly he has
become a relative

1795
02:11:19,734 --> 02:11:22,430
You risked your life to save her
but you've become a burden.

1796
02:11:22,971 --> 02:11:23,938
What sort of people they are?

1797
02:11:25,640 --> 02:11:27,267
Even madam didn't thank you.

1798
02:11:28,309 --> 02:11:28,707
You're wrong balu.

1799
02:11:30,545 --> 02:11:33,514
You can work and ask for salary
You can lend money and ask interest.

1800
02:11:34,315 --> 02:11:36,647
But never ask thanks
after helping someone.

1801
02:11:39,454 --> 02:11:40,944
l'm working here for
the past 10 years.

1802
02:11:41,923 --> 02:11:43,322
l never saw a king here.

1803
02:11:43,925 --> 02:11:46,758
First time l am seeing
how a king would be.

1804
02:11:48,930 --> 02:11:51,660
Go away sir.
People like you shouldn't be here.

1805
02:11:52,533 --> 02:11:55,661
l'll go away.
l'll go away after this night.

1806
02:13:17,552 --> 02:13:18,712
l felt like someone entering
Maleeshwari's room.

1807
02:13:18,986 --> 02:13:19,714
l came in to check.

1808
02:13:19,987 --> 02:13:21,181
You came in and say some
one else had come in

1809
02:13:21,656 --> 02:13:23,089
Door is locked.
How did you enter?

1810
02:13:25,793 --> 02:13:27,226
True, some one had
entered this room

1811
02:13:27,662 --> 02:13:29,892
What's he doing here
at mid night?

1812
02:13:30,131 --> 02:13:31,758
Don't act smart.

1813
02:13:31,999 --> 02:13:34,194
He told me he'll kill
Maleeshwari tonight.

1814
02:13:34,569 --> 02:13:35,763
What are you blabbering?
Are you drunk?'

1815
02:13:36,003 --> 02:13:38,198
Just think over it.
They stage managed the accident.

1816
02:13:38,573 --> 02:13:40,040
They tried to kill her using
professional killers.

1817
02:13:40,241 --> 02:13:42,209
Will you believe them or me?
Tell me sir.

1818
02:13:44,345 --> 02:13:46,575
Malleeshwari, you tell them.
First you tell us.

1819
02:13:46,814 --> 02:13:48,577
why did you enter the room?

1820
02:13:48,816 --> 02:13:50,249
l don't mind if you
don't believe me.

1821
02:13:50,718 --> 02:13:52,709
But please don't believe him.
He'll never allow her to live.

1822
02:13:52,954 --> 02:13:54,251
malleeshwari, he's like a snake.
Never trust him.

1823
02:13:54,622 --> 02:13:56,283
Shut up.
-Calling him disrespectfully.

1824
02:13:56,724 --> 02:13:58,589
why are you talking with him?
Throw him out. -Go.

1825
02:13:59,794 --> 02:14:01,227
Sorry, l lied last evening.

1826
02:14:01,629 --> 02:14:02,960
Go man. go man.

1827
02:14:03,197 --> 02:14:04,255
Please listen to me sir.

1828
02:14:04,999 --> 02:14:05,431
Listen to me.

1829
02:14:05,666 --> 02:14:06,098
Listen to me.

1830
02:14:06,300 --> 02:14:09,269
lf l'd beaten the day you came
with a marriage proposal.

1831
02:14:09,637 --> 02:14:11,264
Things wouldn't have
reached this situation.

1832
02:14:11,439 --> 02:14:12,701
lt's our mistake to allow street
people into the palace.

1833
02:14:12,974 --> 02:14:14,305
Leave him
-You don't brother.

1834
02:14:14,742 --> 02:14:16,175
We mustn't spare him.
we must kill him.

1835
02:14:16,978 --> 02:14:20,175
wrong we, don't have any right
to kill another man.

1836
02:14:21,649 --> 02:14:24,641
lf you shout like this,
my son will wake up.

1837
02:14:25,853 --> 02:14:27,218
He'll ask why are you
beating him?

1838
02:14:27,855 --> 02:14:28,981
we've to tell him everything.

1839
02:14:29,257 --> 02:14:32,317
tomorrow we've a function
Do we need this trouble now?

1840
02:14:37,365 --> 02:14:39,993
lf you want to enter a room,
knock & then enter.

1841
02:14:40,701 --> 02:14:44,000
Don't break windows to enter
lt's wrong.

1842
02:14:44,238 --> 02:14:44,761
Come.

1843
02:14:54,982 --> 02:15:41,118


1844
02:15:42,396 --> 02:15:47,629
when and in whose heart you'll
enter as the flowing season?

1845
02:15:48,402 --> 02:15:53,499
why do you wipe out smiles from
the couple that trusts you?

1846
02:15:53,874 --> 02:15:58,777
Nobody knows it.
unsolved puzzle.

1847
02:15:59,647 --> 02:16:04,641
That's why your story

1849
02:16:34,148 --> 02:16:39,450
A temple with deity
of sadness

1850
02:16:39,954 --> 02:16:45,449
Separation is a hell.

1851
02:16:45,860 --> 02:16:51,162
Grief is the lamp.
pain is the Veda.

1852
02:16:51,766 --> 02:16:57,966
Curse is the blessing.
ls it Justified?

1853
02:16:58,773 --> 02:17:03,437
Consecration of tears.
Dispair the offering.

1854
02:17:03,678 --> 02:17:09,742
heart burn is your sacrificial fir.
oh my love.

1855
02:17:12,253 --> 02:17:48,616


1856
02:17:50,991 --> 02:17:56,293
No dream ever crossed
the boundary of eyelid.

1857
02:18:02,136 --> 02:18:07,369
No shine of lighting ever
remains on earth

1858
02:18:08,142 --> 02:18:13,876
Moonbeam is a mirage
deceiving eyes.

1859
02:18:15,082 --> 02:18:17,312
Through the wild forests,

1860
02:18:17,918 --> 02:18:19,886
lnto the lanes of
cheat & deceits,

1861
02:18:20,121 --> 02:18:26,117
ls it sin to travel with you?
Oh my love!

1862
02:18:32,400 --> 02:18:33,332
whose name should l offer
special prayers?

1863
02:18:49,316 --> 02:18:50,283
Greetings to everyone

1864
02:18:51,318 --> 02:18:53,479
Today is Maleeshwari's birthday.

1865
02:18:54,088 --> 02:18:57,956
A candle will increase as
the cake for anyone on this day.

1866
02:18:58,359 --> 02:19:03,888
But, on this birthday Maleeshwari's bank
balance will grow to Rs.750 crores.

1867
02:19:05,232 --> 02:19:09,999
Bhavani Shankar who had the
property under him for 20 years,

1868
02:19:10,237 --> 02:19:14,139
will legally handover
everything to her.

1869
02:19:14,575 --> 02:19:19,342
Likewise he's making Malleeshwari
his daughter-in-law too.

1870
02:20:27,381 --> 02:20:32,284
From now you're the legal heir
to the property with all rights.

1871
02:20:32,453 --> 02:20:33,477
Please sign it madam.

1872
02:20:49,570 --> 02:20:51,128
The property my father
bequeathed to me,

1873
02:20:56,577 --> 02:21:00,308
the property for which my grandpa
knocked the doors of law.

1874
02:21:02,249 --> 02:21:05,650
Few people tried to
kill me for this.

1875
02:21:06,587 --> 02:21:10,079
Failing in it, they're trying to
make me their daughter-in-law.

1876
02:21:12,493 --> 02:21:13,551
Allow me to speak, grandpa.

1877
02:21:17,398 --> 02:21:20,390
