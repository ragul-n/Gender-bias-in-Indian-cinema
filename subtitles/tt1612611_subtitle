1
00:00:54,035 --> 00:00:56,765
Rohan, where are you going?
- Mother, I'm getting my ball.

2
00:01:08,483 --> 00:01:09,973
Rohan, behave yourself.

3
00:01:27,469 --> 00:01:28,766
Rajeev. -Yes.

4
00:01:30,839 --> 00:01:32,136
What are you looking at?

5
00:01:33,508 --> 00:01:34,532
Nothing.

6
00:01:38,913 --> 00:01:41,143
Papa, let's go.
I'm getting bored here.

7
00:01:41,249 --> 00:01:43,080
Hey, let me start the car first.

8
00:01:46,521 --> 00:01:49,046
Finally. .
- Here we go.

9
00:01:51,393 --> 00:01:54,362
Mother, why did granny
go to God's house?

10
00:01:58,466 --> 00:02:00,991
She has gone to Rishikesh and
Hardwar for a pilgrimage.

11
00:02:01,603 --> 00:02:05,437
Papa, did God make
everything in this world?

12
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:07,799
Yes, Rohan.
Everything is made by God.

13
00:02:07,876 --> 00:02:10,709
Even you?
- Yes, Rohan. And even you.

14
00:02:10,812 --> 00:02:12,939
So sweet.
- Even our house in Mumbai?

15
00:02:13,314 --> 00:02:15,509
House and everything
in the house.

16
00:02:15,583 --> 00:02:18,108
Wow! Everything is done by
God in our house. .

17
00:02:18,486 --> 00:02:20,078
. . so what does papa do?

18
00:02:22,323 --> 00:02:23,620
You'll get it from me now.

19
00:02:24,392 --> 00:02:25,586
He says anything.

20
00:02:26,261 --> 00:02:28,821
Listen, Ronnie and Arushi are
coming, isn't it? -I know.

21
00:02:29,597 --> 00:02:30,859
I've arranged everything.

22
00:02:31,833 --> 00:02:32,857
You know. .

23
00:02:34,369 --> 00:02:35,836
. . I'll see Arushi
after two years.

24
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,299
This America is a strange place.
- Why?

25
00:02:42,844 --> 00:02:44,243
It turned Ranjit into Ronnie.

26
00:02:47,048 --> 00:02:49,243
Rajeev, now you're
being really mean, ok?

27
00:02:49,317 --> 00:02:50,375
I was just kidding.

28
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:52,219
I mean,
he's your brother-in-law.

29
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,981
I was just kidding.

30
00:03:32,127 --> 00:03:34,960
Aarti! Hey, Aarti!

31
00:03:36,164 --> 00:03:37,529
Come on. We've reached.

32
00:03:40,368 --> 00:03:41,630
We've reached.
- Yes, we've.

33
00:03:46,841 --> 00:03:48,399
Raksha. Raksha.

34
00:03:48,476 --> 00:03:49,738
Rohan. Raksha.

35
00:03:50,145 --> 00:03:51,271
Dear Rohan, get up.

36
00:04:05,793 --> 00:04:09,024
Hello, sir. I'm Arnub Goswami.
Site supervisor.

37
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:10,961
Hi, Goswami. -Welcome, sir.
Please. -Thank you.

38
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:13,690
Did you like it, sir?
- Nice house. Interesting.

39
00:04:14,435 --> 00:04:15,766
Rohan, where are you going?

40
00:04:15,837 --> 00:04:17,634
Rohan. -Yeah! -Raksha.

41
00:04:17,705 --> 00:04:19,104
Laxmi, look after them.

42
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:21,599
Actually, they both
are quite excited.

43
00:04:21,676 --> 00:04:23,268
Relax. Let it be.
- A little too much.

44
00:04:24,712 --> 00:04:26,509
Rohan. Rohan.

45
00:04:26,915 --> 00:04:27,939
Hey, Rohan.

46
00:04:28,249 --> 00:04:30,513
Sir, he's khan. Property agent.

47
00:04:30,585 --> 00:04:31,643
Hi, khan.

48
00:04:32,053 --> 00:04:33,077
Of this bungalow.

49
00:04:33,488 --> 00:04:35,080
Greetings, sir.
Hello, madam. -Hello.

50
00:04:35,156 --> 00:04:36,953
Goswami, please get the luggage.
- Ok, sir.

51
00:04:37,025 --> 00:04:39,721
Madam and you can check the
house. -Yes, sir. Come. -Jeetu.

52
00:04:39,794 --> 00:04:41,227
First let see this side.
- Come.

53
00:04:41,963 --> 00:04:43,555
Sir, you must've been
told that some. .

54
00:04:43,631 --> 00:04:44,928
. . work is pending in the house.

55
00:04:44,999 --> 00:04:46,660
Yes, I can see.
- It'll be done in a few days.

56
00:04:46,768 --> 00:04:48,065
You won't have any problems.

57
00:04:54,075 --> 00:04:55,099
Come, Rohan.

58
00:04:58,213 --> 00:04:59,874
Wow! -Look there.

59
00:05:00,882 --> 00:05:02,372
Sir, the forest
begins from there.

60
00:05:05,753 --> 00:05:07,721
So?
- Nobody goes there.

61
00:05:09,524 --> 00:05:12,618
Meaning? -I mean, madam. .
I mean nothing.

62
00:05:12,961 --> 00:05:14,758
That. . come. Let's check inside.

63
00:05:27,609 --> 00:05:28,633
Come.

64
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:34,445
I'll get this swimming pool
cleaned by this evening.

65
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:36,543
And sir,
the beach is out there.

66
00:05:37,585 --> 00:05:38,745
Come, sir.
- Nice view.

67
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:41,948
Sir, the living room is ahead.
The bedroom is there.

68
00:05:42,123 --> 00:05:43,920
And sir, there is bedroom
on this side too.

69
00:05:43,992 --> 00:05:47,155
And sir, there is one bedroom
even upstairs. -And kitchen. .

70
00:05:47,228 --> 00:05:49,423
Where is kitchen?
- Yes, madam. Come, I'll show you.

71
00:06:13,021 --> 00:06:14,079
What?

72
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:18,149
Papa.

73
00:06:20,328 --> 00:06:21,590
Come on. Give me your hand.

74
00:06:23,831 --> 00:06:24,855
Point out.

75
00:06:30,305 --> 00:06:31,397
Better.

76
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:33,539
Sister, let's go.
- Go.

77
00:06:33,641 --> 00:06:35,871
Come on. Go and play.
- Sister, catch me.

78
00:06:37,211 --> 00:06:38,940
Rohan. Rohan, wait.

79
00:06:53,961 --> 00:06:55,189
Sister, wait for me.

80
00:06:57,432 --> 00:06:59,798
Rohan, wait.
Let's wear our shoes.

81
00:07:00,835 --> 00:07:01,859
Stop, Rohan.

82
00:07:03,771 --> 00:07:06,433
Wow! In Mumbai we get to go
to beach only some times.

83
00:07:06,741 --> 00:07:09,005
But here we can play every day.

84
00:07:10,244 --> 00:07:11,268
Wow!

85
00:07:14,916 --> 00:07:17,680
Do you remember the last
time we went to the beach?

86
00:07:18,186 --> 00:07:19,744
We made sand castles.

87
00:07:20,755 --> 00:07:23,349
Hey! You were ill before that.

88
00:07:24,525 --> 00:07:27,187
Do you remember, aunt Madhu
had come home for the first time?

89
00:07:28,396 --> 00:07:29,829
Rohan, stop it.

90
00:08:02,196 --> 00:08:03,823
This garden is in a bad state.

91
00:08:04,065 --> 00:08:05,760
There is grass and
bushes around. .

92
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:07,596
Madam,
a man named Balu is coming.

93
00:08:07,668 --> 00:08:10,432
He'll take care of your garden
and work as watchman too.

94
00:08:10,505 --> 00:08:13,065
Yes, but this compound is. .
- Madam, everything will be done.

95
00:08:13,141 --> 00:08:15,109
Don't get tensed.
He'll be here soon.

96
00:08:15,643 --> 00:08:16,837
Ok, fine.
- Come, madam.

97
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,760
Sister. Sister.

98
00:09:18,239 --> 00:09:19,706
Who told you to go there?

99
00:09:20,107 --> 00:09:23,668
I didn't know that door would get
shut. -It was because of breeze.

100
00:09:23,744 --> 00:09:25,473
Now don't go anywhere
without telling us.

101
00:09:26,914 --> 00:09:29,041
Do you like the place?
- It's superb, papa.

102
00:09:29,116 --> 00:09:31,346
Superb. Enjoying yourself?
- Yes, papa.

103
00:09:31,452 --> 00:09:32,476
Give me five.

104
00:09:42,763 --> 00:09:44,355
keep this dinner set there.
- Ok.

105
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,864
What happened?

106
00:09:54,675 --> 00:09:55,699
Who are you?

107
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:58,108
I. .
- Balu, what are you doing here?

108
00:09:59,113 --> 00:10:00,341
Madam, he's Balu.

109
00:10:00,748 --> 00:10:01,874
I'd mentioned to you.

110
00:10:04,719 --> 00:10:07,153
Yes. That. .
- Madam, that. .

111
00:10:08,789 --> 00:10:10,757
What do you want me to
do in the garden?

112
00:10:11,125 --> 00:10:12,649
Yes, you go ahead.
I'll be there in a while.

113
00:10:18,432 --> 00:10:20,423
I don't know how everything
will be done, Rajeev.

114
00:10:20,501 --> 00:10:21,968
Both of you look very happy here.

115
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:24,170
It seems you like this
place a lot. -A lot?

116
00:10:24,672 --> 00:10:26,731
Such a big bungalow
and the beach!

117
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:29,904
These will be our best holidays.

118
00:10:30,344 --> 00:10:33,313
Best? Then go and enjoy.
And give me five for that.

119
00:10:33,381 --> 00:10:34,439
Yeah!
- Five.

120
00:10:35,249 --> 00:10:38,184
It's a big bungalow.
We've not yet seen it properly.

121
00:10:38,286 --> 00:10:39,310
Really?

122
00:10:39,387 --> 00:10:41,947
We should find a cupboard here. .

123
00:10:42,924 --> 00:10:45,119
. . which would lead
to another world.

124
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,352
Just like Narnia.

125
00:10:52,033 --> 00:10:53,864
Just like Narnia!

126
00:11:17,024 --> 00:11:20,619
"I sleepless. . "

127
00:11:21,228 --> 00:11:24,925
". . the night seems to be long. "

128
00:11:27,001 --> 00:11:29,663
"What's the matter. . "

129
00:11:44,185 --> 00:11:46,119
It's nothing, Rohan.
The breeze is doing it.

130
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,612
Let's go to sleep.

131
00:11:51,492 --> 00:11:52,823
Go to sleep, kids. It's late.

132
00:11:52,994 --> 00:11:55,622
Come on. -Ok, mother. -Come on,
Rohan. -Good night, mother.

133
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:57,391
Good night, mother.
- Good night.

134
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:07,037
Laxmi.
- Yes?

135
00:12:07,308 --> 00:12:09,105
Check the doors.
- Yes, madam.

136
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:11,041
And turn off the lights.
- Ok.

137
00:13:10,204 --> 00:13:11,671
What is it? What happened?

138
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:15,937
Nothing, it was just a nightmare.

139
00:13:20,481 --> 00:13:21,778
Nothing will happen. Go to sleep.

140
00:16:15,322 --> 00:16:17,882
Aarti.
- Coming.

141
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:19,583
I'm getting late.

142
00:16:19,994 --> 00:16:21,018
I know.

143
00:16:23,063 --> 00:16:24,963
Take this.
- Yes. Just a minute.

144
00:16:25,032 --> 00:16:27,330
Sister, take this.
- When will you return?

145
00:16:29,303 --> 00:16:31,669
When did you start questioning
like traditional wives?

146
00:16:32,206 --> 00:16:33,434
Can't I ask you?

147
00:16:33,507 --> 00:16:35,839
No.
But you never did it before.

148
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:38,845
Yes. But it's a new place
so generally. .

149
00:16:40,114 --> 00:16:41,138
Around 7.00- 7. 30.

150
00:16:42,182 --> 00:16:43,649
Give me the file.
- Oh! Sorry.

151
00:16:44,118 --> 00:16:46,416
By the way, come here.

152
00:16:48,222 --> 00:16:50,383
I really feel like
we just got married.

153
00:16:52,226 --> 00:16:53,591
Ok. You can think that.

154
00:16:54,161 --> 00:16:55,526
That's it.
- Yes.

155
00:16:55,763 --> 00:16:56,991
That's it.
- Bye.

156
00:16:58,332 --> 00:16:59,890
Rohan. Raksha.

157
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,092
Bye, papa.
- Take care.

158
00:17:01,201 --> 00:17:02,225
Bye, papa.

159
00:17:02,903 --> 00:17:04,165
All right. Bye.
- Have fun.

160
00:17:05,172 --> 00:17:06,196
Bye.

161
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,474
Yes, Goswami.
- Hello, sir. Let's go.

162
00:17:14,248 --> 00:17:15,272
Catch this, Rohan.

163
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:24,482
Rohan, you're too much.

164
00:17:44,645 --> 00:17:46,943
Rohan, let's go to the beach.

165
00:17:49,316 --> 00:17:51,511
Sister. Sister, wait for me.

166
00:17:51,585 --> 00:17:53,348
Sister.
- Enough. Enough.

167
00:17:54,621 --> 00:17:58,614
Sister, isn't there any other
kids to play with us?

168
00:17:58,959 --> 00:18:00,187
Why? Am I not here?

169
00:18:00,828 --> 00:18:02,989
Will I play only with you?

170
00:18:03,764 --> 00:18:05,994
Oh! Don't be over smart.

171
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,892
Or I won't play with you at all.

172
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:13,298
Rohan, let's see what
else is here. -Where?

173
00:18:20,714 --> 00:18:21,738
Leave the ball.

174
00:18:43,003 --> 00:18:44,971
Sister,
why are you we going there?

175
00:18:45,239 --> 00:18:46,604
Come on. Let's explore.

176
00:18:46,673 --> 00:18:48,300
What if we get lost?

177
00:18:48,842 --> 00:18:50,707
I know the way. Let's go, dumb.

178
00:19:18,072 --> 00:19:19,164
Rohan.

179
00:19:22,643 --> 00:19:23,701
Rohan.

180
00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:26,303
Rohan.

181
00:19:37,925 --> 00:19:38,949
Rohan!

182
00:19:45,065 --> 00:19:46,089
Rohan!

183
00:19:58,145 --> 00:19:59,169
Rohan!

184
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:27,798
Rohan!

185
00:20:52,032 --> 00:20:53,056
Rohan!

186
00:20:57,304 --> 00:20:58,669
Rohan, where are you?

187
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:04,334
Rohan!

188
00:21:08,515 --> 00:21:09,539
Rohan!

189
00:21:15,155 --> 00:21:16,281
Rohan, where are you?

190
00:21:20,661 --> 00:21:21,719
Rohan.

191
00:21:41,648 --> 00:21:42,740
Rohan, idiot!

192
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:46,018
Why? Didn't you get scared?
- Rohan, don't do it again. Ok?

193
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:47,917
I really got scared.

194
00:22:03,103 --> 00:22:04,161
Let's go.

195
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:53,103
Rohan.

196
00:23:58,318 --> 00:23:59,683
Rohan.

197
00:24:08,128 --> 00:24:09,186
Rohan.

198
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:08,588
Laxmi, bring the bread
and lady finger.

199
00:25:08,688 --> 00:25:09,916
Yes, madam.
- I want rice.

200
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:11,150
Rice?
- I want bread.

201
00:25:11,491 --> 00:25:13,322
Who will eat bread?
- Wait a minute. -Nobody.

202
00:25:14,461 --> 00:25:16,053
Laxmi, give it to him.
- Hi, vinay.

203
00:25:16,163 --> 00:25:17,255
Ok.
- Bread.

204
00:25:18,732 --> 00:25:19,756
Enough.
- Wow!

205
00:25:20,434 --> 00:25:21,458
You want bread?

206
00:25:21,601 --> 00:25:23,091
We got it
little early this time.

207
00:25:24,237 --> 00:25:25,261
Raksha.

208
00:25:27,407 --> 00:25:28,431
Superb. Fantastic.

209
00:25:29,209 --> 00:25:30,233
Mind blowing.

210
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,384
You ok?

211
00:25:49,362 --> 00:25:51,762
No, it's just. .
I don't feel so well.

212
00:25:52,365 --> 00:25:53,389
What happened?

213
00:25:54,568 --> 00:25:55,592
Nothing.

214
00:25:55,702 --> 00:25:56,828
I'm just a bit tired.

215
00:25:56,903 --> 00:25:57,961
So take it easy.

216
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:00,666
You don't need to do
everything at once.

217
00:26:01,675 --> 00:26:02,869
Why do you take stress?

218
00:26:03,944 --> 00:26:05,411
Want to see a doctor?
- No.

219
00:26:05,912 --> 00:26:07,345
Are you sure?
- Yeah.

220
00:26:07,747 --> 00:26:10,443
Ok, tomorrow Arushi and Ronnie. .
- I know they're coming.

221
00:26:10,517 --> 00:26:12,485
Go to sleep. -Yes. I'll do that.
- You'll feel better.

222
00:26:12,552 --> 00:26:13,576
Yeah.
- Ok, go.

223
00:26:32,272 --> 00:26:33,705
Raksha. Rohan.

224
00:26:34,107 --> 00:26:35,699
Don't you want ice-cream?
Come fast.

225
00:26:36,042 --> 00:26:37,066
Coming, mother.

226
00:28:04,965 --> 00:28:05,989
Sister.

227
00:28:07,801 --> 00:28:08,825
What happened?

228
00:28:11,471 --> 00:28:14,338
That. .
that doll was looking at you.

229
00:28:24,517 --> 00:28:25,677
Don't talk nonsense.

230
00:28:25,752 --> 00:28:26,946
I saw it, sister.

231
00:28:27,587 --> 00:28:31,819
That doll just turned
her head towards you.

232
00:28:37,664 --> 00:28:39,063
I'm not going to get scared.

233
00:28:39,466 --> 00:28:41,263
I'm going to beach.
You can come if you want.

234
00:28:52,312 --> 00:28:53,336
Mama.

235
00:28:53,513 --> 00:28:55,447
Rohan, it's just a doll.

236
00:28:55,882 --> 00:28:57,747
Rajeev, how are you talking?
Don't scold him.

237
00:28:57,884 --> 00:29:00,216
I'm not scolding him, I'm
explaining it to him. -But. .

238
00:29:01,121 --> 00:29:03,749
I know, but he's a kid.
He's scared. That's it.

239
00:29:03,823 --> 00:29:05,757
Mother. . -I'm. .
- What happened?

240
00:29:06,359 --> 00:29:07,986
Again?
- What is it?

241
00:29:10,664 --> 00:29:12,689
Rohan, it's nothing.
It's just a doll.

242
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,963
See?
- Again it. .

243
00:29:16,469 --> 00:29:17,834
It didn't do anything, Rohan.

244
00:29:17,904 --> 00:29:18,928
Balu.
- Yes, sir.

245
00:29:19,272 --> 00:29:20,830
Take this doll and
throw it out right now.

246
00:29:20,907 --> 00:29:22,841
Papa, please.
- Rajeev, please.

247
00:29:23,076 --> 00:29:25,237
Papa, not the doll, please.
- Raksha.

248
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,704
Sit there.

249
00:29:27,847 --> 00:29:29,109
Rajeev, this. .
- Sit there.

250
00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:32,982
Rajeev, listen to me.
You're just over-reacting.

251
00:29:33,586 --> 00:29:34,610
I'm over. .

252
00:29:36,589 --> 00:29:38,750
Didn't you hear me? Take it away.

253
00:29:39,059 --> 00:29:40,117
Rajeev.

254
00:30:22,168 --> 00:30:23,192
Let it be now.

255
00:30:25,672 --> 00:30:27,537
Ok, eat this ice-cream.

256
00:30:28,074 --> 00:30:29,132
I don't want it.

257
00:30:29,642 --> 00:30:30,939
Don't be stubborn, Raksha.

258
00:30:31,444 --> 00:30:32,672
I said, I don't want it.

259
00:30:32,879 --> 00:30:34,141
Sir, will bring a new doll.

260
00:30:34,848 --> 00:30:37,442
And come downstairs.
Rohan is waiting for you.

261
00:30:38,651 --> 00:30:39,879
I don't want a new doll.

262
00:30:39,953 --> 00:30:41,215
And I don't any want ice-cream.

263
00:30:42,956 --> 00:30:44,218
That doll wasn't so nice.

264
00:30:44,591 --> 00:30:46,388
It didn't look like a doll
but more like a human.

265
00:30:52,432 --> 00:30:54,457
Maybe papa and you
didn't like that doll.

266
00:30:54,701 --> 00:30:56,191
But I like that doll.

267
00:34:00,186 --> 00:34:01,210
Papa.

268
00:34:05,625 --> 00:34:06,717
Papa!

269
00:34:08,995 --> 00:34:10,121
Papa!

270
00:34:11,397 --> 00:34:12,421
Raksha.

271
00:34:12,899 --> 00:34:13,957
Papa! -Raksha!

272
00:34:14,033 --> 00:34:15,261
Raksha!
- What happened?

273
00:34:15,668 --> 00:34:17,158
What happened?
- What happened?

274
00:34:18,004 --> 00:34:19,904
What. . what happened?

275
00:34:20,006 --> 00:34:22,270
That. .
that doll was outside. -What?

276
00:34:22,342 --> 00:34:23,741
That. . was outside.

277
00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:27,138
There. . it was out. . out there.
- Where is the doll?

278
00:34:27,246 --> 00:34:28,975
What are talking about?
- What is she saying?

279
00:34:29,082 --> 00:34:32,074
It was outside, papa. -But when
I woke up, it wasn't there.

280
00:34:32,218 --> 00:34:34,083
There isn't any doll, Raksha.
- Just a minute.

281
00:34:34,153 --> 00:34:35,484
There is nothing.
- Listen to me.

282
00:34:35,688 --> 00:34:37,383
No, papa.
- There isn't any doll, Raksha.

283
00:34:37,724 --> 00:34:38,918
Look, nothing is there.

284
00:34:39,759 --> 00:34:41,158
Raksha, listen. Listen to me.

285
00:34:41,394 --> 00:34:42,861
Ok. .
- We'll bring a new doll. Ok?

286
00:34:43,363 --> 00:34:44,955
What's wrong
with the two of you?

287
00:34:45,198 --> 00:34:46,256
You scared him too.

288
00:34:46,699 --> 00:34:47,757
Come here.

289
00:34:48,167 --> 00:34:49,191
You all right?

290
00:34:49,302 --> 00:34:50,599
Come to me.
- Go to sleep.

291
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:52,729
You all right? -You must've
had a nightmare, dear.

292
00:34:54,907 --> 00:34:55,931
Go to sleep.

293
00:34:56,342 --> 00:34:57,502
Come on. Go to sleep.

294
00:34:57,844 --> 00:34:58,868
Ok?
- Go on.

295
00:34:59,112 --> 00:35:02,104
There's nothing. -You too go to
sleep. -Ok? -Put him to bed.

296
00:35:02,181 --> 00:35:03,307
It's nothing. Nothing.

297
00:35:03,716 --> 00:35:05,980
Ok? I'm here.
- Come on. Go to sleep. -Sleep.

298
00:35:06,085 --> 00:35:07,712
Good. Good boy.

299
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:15,851
Tomorrow Ronnie uncle and
aunt Arushi are coming.

300
00:35:16,729 --> 00:35:18,026
Go to sleep. Ok?

301
00:35:18,364 --> 00:35:19,422
Close your eyes.

302
00:35:20,466 --> 00:35:21,831
Good. Ok?

303
00:35:23,503 --> 00:35:25,266
I'm here.
- Nothing will happen, Raksha.

304
00:35:25,371 --> 00:35:26,668
Go to sleep. Ok?
- I'm here.

305
00:35:29,942 --> 00:35:31,603
Go to sleep.
Close your eyes. Come on.

306
00:36:13,619 --> 00:36:14,881
It's really hot. isn't it?
- Yes.

307
00:36:15,388 --> 00:36:17,356
Aunt Arushi!
- My darling.

308
00:36:17,623 --> 00:36:18,681
Yes, kids.

309
00:36:18,858 --> 00:36:20,325
You've grown so big.

310
00:36:21,461 --> 00:36:22,519
Brother.

311
00:36:23,996 --> 00:36:25,554
How are you, brother?
- I'm superb.

312
00:36:27,233 --> 00:36:30,293
Seeing the love of brother and
sister, tears came in my eyes.

313
00:36:30,636 --> 00:36:32,331
Enough! Funny as always.

314
00:36:32,605 --> 00:36:34,004
Look at her husband too, friend.

315
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:37,832
I can see you. -How are you?
- How are you, bro? -Superb.

316
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:39,241
Did you get the doll?
- Yes.

317
00:36:40,146 --> 00:36:41,670
There is a forest here.
- Really? Where?

318
00:36:48,187 --> 00:36:49,586
Rohan. Rohan.

319
00:36:50,089 --> 00:36:52,114
You be careful with that camera
now. -It's ok, Aarti.

320
00:36:52,258 --> 00:36:53,316
Don't worry.

321
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,219
Thank you aunt Arushi.
- You're welcome.

322
00:37:01,601 --> 00:37:02,625
Raksha.

323
00:37:02,969 --> 00:37:03,993
Come.

324
00:37:06,272 --> 00:37:07,296
What happened?

325
00:37:07,874 --> 00:37:09,205
You didn't like the doll.

326
00:37:09,942 --> 00:37:11,273
It's nice, but. .

327
00:37:11,811 --> 00:37:12,937
. . the old doll. .

328
00:37:13,913 --> 00:37:14,937
I see.

329
00:37:15,081 --> 00:37:17,242
You didn't like the doll
since I've brought it.

330
00:37:17,717 --> 00:37:19,742
No. It's not so.

331
00:37:20,953 --> 00:37:22,147
Of course she liked it.

332
00:37:22,221 --> 00:37:23,279
I hope so.

333
00:37:24,423 --> 00:37:26,015
Ok, let's have some fun.

334
00:37:26,392 --> 00:37:27,654
Yeah! But like what?

335
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:28,784
Where?
- Where?

336
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:31,788
Let's go to beach.

337
00:37:33,232 --> 00:37:35,166
I'll tell you a joke.
- Ok.

338
00:37:35,234 --> 00:37:36,758
Shall I? Hello.
- Yes. -Yes, please.

339
00:37:37,770 --> 00:37:40,000
When I was in college a
salesman came to our hostel.

340
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:43,700
He asked me, which shaving
cream do you use, sir?

341
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:45,443
I said of Philips.
- Ok.

342
00:37:45,645 --> 00:37:47,909
Rajeev. . -Just hang on.
- Ok. -Right?

343
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:51,279
Then he asked, which
after-shave do you use, sir?

344
00:37:51,350 --> 00:37:52,578
I said of Philips. Ok?

345
00:37:52,919 --> 00:37:54,546
Which deodorant do you use?

346
00:37:55,087 --> 00:37:57,749
I said of Philips. -Ok? -He asked
about soap. I said Philips.

347
00:37:57,823 --> 00:37:59,950
He asked shampoo.
I said Philips. -Philips.

348
00:38:00,726 --> 00:38:03,194
So finally he got irritated
and asked me, sir. .

349
00:38:03,729 --> 00:38:06,755
. . if I'm not wrong, Philips makes
only Tv and tape recorder.

350
00:38:06,866 --> 00:38:08,834
So. . -Yes. -Exactly. -All this. .

351
00:38:09,402 --> 00:38:10,767
So guess what I said.
- What?

352
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:12,264
Guess.
- What?

353
00:38:12,705 --> 00:38:14,730
I said Philips is the
name of my friend.

354
00:38:16,309 --> 00:38:18,072
Rajeev, I knew it.

355
00:38:18,144 --> 00:38:19,304
See. I knew it.

356
00:38:19,679 --> 00:38:20,941
What happened to him?

357
00:38:21,047 --> 00:38:22,105
Ha, ha, ha. What?

358
00:38:22,548 --> 00:38:23,742
What did you understand?

359
00:38:23,849 --> 00:38:27,012
That when papa was in
college, he was a thief.

360
00:40:30,509 --> 00:40:31,533
Do you remember. .

361
00:40:34,313 --> 00:40:35,507
. . the day she was born?

362
00:40:46,392 --> 00:40:47,416
Yeah.

363
00:40:55,968 --> 00:40:56,992
Rohan, come here.

364
00:40:57,169 --> 00:40:58,193
Rohan, hey.

365
00:42:43,843 --> 00:42:44,867
Ra. .

366
00:42:54,487 --> 00:42:56,921
What happened? What happened?

367
00:43:00,793 --> 00:43:01,987
Here. something. .

368
00:43:02,661 --> 00:43:03,958
Tell me something.

369
00:43:04,530 --> 00:43:05,690
There is something.

370
00:43:06,365 --> 00:43:07,389
Where?

371
00:43:07,666 --> 00:43:08,963
There is. .
- It's nothing.

372
00:43:09,502 --> 00:43:10,969
There is something.
- What?

373
00:43:11,237 --> 00:43:12,704
What? What?

374
00:43:13,439 --> 00:43:15,100
Relax, Aarti. Relax.

375
00:43:15,307 --> 00:43:18,640
I. . I can hear voices.

376
00:43:20,179 --> 00:43:21,942
Which voices, Aarti?
Nothing is here.

377
00:43:22,982 --> 00:43:25,746
There is. .
- There is something. Something.

378
00:43:26,318 --> 00:43:27,751
Hey, relax.
- There is something.

379
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:28,878
Aarti. . -I. .

380
00:43:29,221 --> 00:43:30,279
What?
- That. .

381
00:43:30,356 --> 00:43:32,790
Relax. Take a deep breath.
Take a deep breath.

382
00:43:33,425 --> 00:43:35,655
Relax. There is nothing. Ok?

383
00:43:35,761 --> 00:43:37,194
I can feel it.
- Aarti.

384
00:43:37,263 --> 00:43:38,321
It's nothing.

385
00:43:40,032 --> 00:43:42,660
Ok, come. Sit here. -No.
- I don't want to sit. -Aarti.

386
00:43:42,768 --> 00:43:45,396
Ok. Ok. Ok.
- I don't want to.

387
00:43:45,704 --> 00:43:47,035
Relax. Relax.
- I'm scared.

388
00:43:47,273 --> 00:43:48,297
Relax.

389
00:43:48,741 --> 00:43:49,799
Ah!

390
00:43:52,278 --> 00:43:53,575
There is nothing, Aarti.

391
00:43:59,919 --> 00:44:02,114
Take it easy.

392
00:44:08,193 --> 00:44:09,217
There. .

393
00:46:07,513 --> 00:46:11,279
Do you hear something?
- I heard some voices. -Where?

394
00:46:15,087 --> 00:46:16,111
Arushi. .

395
00:46:53,158 --> 00:46:54,182
Come.

396
00:46:57,463 --> 00:46:59,192
What was that?

397
00:46:59,465 --> 00:47:01,092
Just calm down, Arushi.

398
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:02,224
Please.

399
00:47:02,434 --> 00:47:03,662
Brother.
- What happened?

400
00:47:04,403 --> 00:47:05,427
Brother.
- What happened?

401
00:47:05,804 --> 00:47:07,294
What. . what happened?

402
00:47:08,207 --> 00:47:10,334
We. .
we were in the forest. . -What?

403
00:47:10,442 --> 00:47:11,841
Somebody was chasing us and. .

404
00:47:12,044 --> 00:47:13,102
Who was chasing you?

405
00:47:13,345 --> 00:47:14,972
We heard strange voices.
- What?

406
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:16,445
It was very confusing.

407
00:47:16,882 --> 00:47:18,076
It must be some animal.

408
00:47:18,150 --> 00:47:20,345
No, brother.
No. It wasn't an animal.

409
00:47:20,686 --> 00:47:22,313
There was no animal.
- Relax, Arushi.

410
00:47:22,387 --> 00:47:24,150
Relax. -There wasn't
any animal, brother.

411
00:47:24,289 --> 00:47:25,313
Aarti.

412
00:48:00,359 --> 00:48:01,917
Destruction!

413
00:48:03,962 --> 00:48:05,224
Infliction!

414
00:48:08,267 --> 00:48:09,757
Imminent!

415
00:48:13,071 --> 00:48:14,834
Destruction!

416
00:48:20,946 --> 00:48:21,970
Aarti.

417
00:48:29,988 --> 00:48:31,012
Aarti.

418
00:48:34,226 --> 00:48:35,250
Aarti.

419
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:44,628
Not Aarti, but Madhu!

420
00:48:50,742 --> 00:48:51,800
Mother.

421
00:48:52,878 --> 00:48:53,902
Raksha.

422
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:55,444
You haven't changed as yet.

423
00:48:56,715 --> 00:48:58,239
I'll do it, mother.
Don't bother me.

424
00:48:58,517 --> 00:48:59,745
Ok, did you see my doll?

425
00:49:00,352 --> 00:49:01,683
Doll? No.

426
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:03,144
Let's find it.

427
00:49:04,723 --> 00:49:05,849
I'll make them suffer.

428
00:49:07,593 --> 00:49:10,221
I'll make them suffer and
kill all of them. .

429
00:49:13,398 --> 00:49:15,161
. . whom you love.

430
00:49:29,047 --> 00:49:30,105
Yes, Rajeev.
- vinay.

431
00:49:32,284 --> 00:49:33,342
Madhu has returned.

432
00:49:34,486 --> 00:49:36,181
Which Madhu?
- Which Madhu! Madhu.

433
00:49:36,989 --> 00:49:39,048
Rajeev, you. . are you mad?

434
00:49:39,157 --> 00:49:41,557
Listen to me.
- Madhu is dead.

435
00:49:41,860 --> 00:49:44,920
I just heard her. Maybe she's
a ghost or something. I heard. .

436
00:49:45,264 --> 00:49:46,492
. . Aarti in Madhu's voice.

437
00:49:47,833 --> 00:49:49,994
Rajeev. Rajeev,
how. . how is this possible?

438
00:49:50,302 --> 00:49:52,236
vinay, I've no time.

439
00:49:52,537 --> 00:49:53,629
You. . Iisten to me.

440
00:49:54,239 --> 00:49:56,639
A gardener works at our place.
Balu.

441
00:49:56,875 --> 00:49:59,639
He said he'll bring a exorcist
from a nearby village. .

442
00:49:59,711 --> 00:50:02,271
. . but I don't trust him.
- You bring Manja here.

443
00:50:02,347 --> 00:50:04,508
Ok, Rajeev. Rajeev, relax.

444
00:50:04,983 --> 00:50:06,507
Hurry up.
Bring him quickly, vinay.

445
00:50:07,552 --> 00:50:08,917
Look, I'll do something. Ok?

446
00:50:09,621 --> 00:50:10,781
I'll bring Manja.

447
00:50:20,766 --> 00:50:21,790
Raksha.

448
00:50:23,702 --> 00:50:24,828
What happened, papa?

449
00:50:25,904 --> 00:50:27,269
What happened, Rajeev?

450
00:50:29,608 --> 00:50:30,632
Nothing.

451
00:50:31,877 --> 00:50:33,970
Papa, let's go on a drive.

452
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:36,311
I'm getting bored here.

453
00:50:37,049 --> 00:50:38,539
Even this beach
looks boring now.

454
00:50:38,817 --> 00:50:39,875
Yes, take them.

455
00:50:40,519 --> 00:50:41,611
We'll go tomorrow.

456
00:50:42,554 --> 00:50:44,954
Yeah! Rohan. Rohan, listen.

457
00:50:51,596 --> 00:50:54,087
I won't kill her so easily.

458
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:58,030
Didn't I say that I'll
make her suffer?

459
00:50:59,871 --> 00:51:01,498
You can't even escape, Rajeev.

460
00:51:03,241 --> 00:51:07,701
Because Aarti is with me.

461
00:51:10,315 --> 00:51:11,577
What did you say to vinay?

462
00:51:12,918 --> 00:51:13,942
To Balu?

463
00:51:17,389 --> 00:51:20,449
Go. Do what you want to do.

464
00:51:22,594 --> 00:51:24,721
Bring whomever you want.

465
00:55:33,745 --> 00:55:35,906
Again and again you're thinking
about. . -It's not so.

466
00:55:39,217 --> 00:55:42,084
It's not that I don't
want to forget it.

467
00:55:46,157 --> 00:55:47,181
Ronnie. .

468
00:55:49,394 --> 00:55:50,418
. . I don't know. .

469
00:55:53,198 --> 00:55:54,222
. . what it was.

470
00:55:58,203 --> 00:56:01,639
Just forget it.
It's no use thinking about it.

471
00:56:05,410 --> 00:56:08,243
I mean. . those voices. .

472
00:56:09,281 --> 00:56:12,114
That laughter. Those footsteps.

473
00:56:15,754 --> 00:56:16,948
Please forget all that.

474
00:56:20,058 --> 00:56:21,116
Please.

475
00:56:24,262 --> 00:56:27,629
And. . and just relax. Ok?

476
01:00:45,590 --> 01:00:46,852
I like that car.

477
01:00:47,659 --> 01:00:48,990
Rajeev. -Yes, vinay?

478
01:00:49,527 --> 01:00:51,188
That one. -That. .
- Manja. .

479
01:00:51,729 --> 01:00:52,821
Manja is dead.
- What?

480
01:00:52,997 --> 01:00:54,487
Yes, but. .
- His head was. .

481
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:57,067
He was beheaded.
- What?

482
01:00:58,503 --> 01:00:59,731
Rajeev, there. .

483
01:01:01,105 --> 01:01:02,436
Are Raksha and Rohan fine?

484
01:01:04,075 --> 01:01:05,303
They're with me, friend.

485
01:01:07,445 --> 01:01:10,972
Listen, Rajeev. I've found a man.

486
01:01:12,150 --> 01:01:13,549
He can surely help us.

487
01:01:14,419 --> 01:01:16,011
I'll bring him there
this evening.

488
01:01:17,288 --> 01:01:19,051
Look, Rajeev.
Take care of Raksha and Rohan.

489
01:01:21,759 --> 01:01:23,386
Papa, what happened?

490
01:01:24,996 --> 01:01:26,020
Nothing.

491
01:02:46,177 --> 01:02:48,168
Papa, what happened?

492
01:02:50,682 --> 01:02:52,547
Nothing.
Just an accident. -Accident?

493
01:02:52,917 --> 01:02:54,680
Get inside. Get in.

494
01:02:55,219 --> 01:02:56,277
Raksha, get in.

495
01:03:12,136 --> 01:03:15,663
So because they were corrupt. .

496
01:03:16,841 --> 01:03:20,504
. . you fired Madhu and her
husband from the job.

497
01:03:21,179 --> 01:03:23,079
Yes. And when I found
out that Madhu was. .

498
01:03:23,147 --> 01:03:24,739
. . doing black magic
on my daughter. .

499
01:03:25,483 --> 01:03:27,348
. . we took witch-doctor
Manja's help and. .

500
01:03:27,919 --> 01:03:29,011
. . he killed Madhu.

501
01:03:29,821 --> 01:03:32,585
It seems like everything was
over, but now it feels. .

502
01:03:32,857 --> 01:03:35,348
. . that Madhu has returned
as a ghost.

503
01:03:36,060 --> 01:03:37,118
But how?

504
01:03:37,962 --> 01:03:40,430
After dying where do people go?

505
01:03:41,299 --> 01:03:42,357
Nowhere.

506
01:03:43,701 --> 01:03:45,726
They're here around us.

507
01:03:46,938 --> 01:03:49,998
Nobody goes away from
this world forever.

508
01:03:51,242 --> 01:03:54,507
They return as spirits or ghosts.

509
01:03:55,646 --> 01:03:59,173
Madhu's hatred towards you
became an deep obsession.

510
01:04:01,119 --> 01:04:03,485
But she couldn't take
revenge in her lifetime.

511
01:04:03,921 --> 01:04:05,821
So she has returned.

512
01:04:05,923 --> 01:04:10,656
And to take revenge from you
she's using your wife's body.

513
01:04:15,633 --> 01:04:17,692
Now what? Now. .

514
01:04:18,770 --> 01:04:21,500
Can you bring Madhu's
husband here?

515
01:04:22,907 --> 01:04:26,536
He must've some
secrets of Madhu. .

516
01:04:27,278 --> 01:04:31,442
. . which can help me in
confronting Madhu's spirit.

517
01:04:32,083 --> 01:04:36,747
Until then it can be dangerous
for me to enter your house.

518
01:04:38,122 --> 01:04:41,114
I'll bring him. No matter
where ever he is, I'll bring him.

519
01:04:42,260 --> 01:04:44,558
Rajeev, take care.
I'll bring him.

520
01:04:50,101 --> 01:04:51,864
When her husband returns. .

521
01:04:52,737 --> 01:04:54,068
. . everything will be fine.

522
01:04:54,839 --> 01:04:57,399
Till then be careful.

523
01:04:58,309 --> 01:04:59,970
She's a ghost.

524
01:05:00,778 --> 01:05:04,771
And don't forget, your wife's
body is in her control.

525
01:05:06,818 --> 01:05:09,719
Now go and until they return. .

526
01:05:10,988 --> 01:05:13,422
. . take care of your daughter.

527
01:05:28,272 --> 01:05:30,900
Hail peace!

528
01:05:32,977 --> 01:05:37,710
Hail peace!

529
01:05:41,586 --> 01:05:42,610
Madam, tea.

530
01:05:45,022 --> 01:05:46,046
Madam. .

531
01:05:49,994 --> 01:05:51,018
Madam.

532
01:05:56,500 --> 01:05:57,558
Madam.

533
01:06:01,472 --> 01:06:02,734
