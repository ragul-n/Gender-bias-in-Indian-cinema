1
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:50,020
Sometimes it happens...

2
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,520
You're going about your normal routine...

3
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:56,770
Suddenly a new person enters your life...

4
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:00,810
Next thing you know, you're
getting to know each other...

5
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,900
You start liking the person

6
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:08,600
but then time...

7
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:13,230
it's not always on our side...

8
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:17,980
There are stories that end
before they begin....

9
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:21,350
Mine isn't the first...

10
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:24,060
Mine won't be the last either...

11
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:10,520
Seven?

12
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:11,060
No

13
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:12,690
Definitely 10/10

14
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,350
Listen,

15
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:18,730
this one is a 7/10

16
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:21,730
Which one?

17
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:23,020
The one in black?

18
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,140
No way! The one in pink

19
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:28,730
The one in black is not hot!

20
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:33,650
What about her?
Can we give her a 6?

21
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:36,940
No. Give her a tender coconut instead!

22
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:38,390
She looks really tired!

23
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,100
This will be the last time

24
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:47,850
Henceforth, I'm not going to help you
in this regard

25
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:52,060
Why can't you jog a little bit
at least in the morning?

26
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:54,940
One should always focus
on going forward in life...

27
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:56,810
but not here

28
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:01,480
Instead, you come here, drink tender coconut &
comment on girls, that's it!

29
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:04,190
C’mon don’t say that!
Sir does workout

30
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:06,100
But only with his eyes

31
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:07,650
Ah! See...

32
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,190
The eyes seem to have done their job!

33
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:11,440
Tarun...

34
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,230
Four kilometres in half an hour?

35
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,600
You think I'm some race horse
to do that distance?

36
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:20,770
Will your aunt even believe me
if I show this to her?

37
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:22,850
She definitely won't

38
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:26,480
How will you know the difficulties of
convincing one's wife?

39
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:29,770
You can't do a decent job of anything!

40
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:33,350
Come on, you should be
thanking me for helping you

41
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,060
And here you are shouting at
me for no fault of mine!

42
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:35,900
Look here,

43
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:40,020
being a husband is no easy job

44
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:42,440
I'd have gone home and
peacefully eaten my breakfast

45
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:45,560
And you had to ruin it all

46
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:48,020
Now I have to spend another half an hour...

47
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:50,350
to make sure the reading is believable

48
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:52,940
Ok, from tomorrow

49
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:55,520
I’ll ask aunty to accompany,
on your daily walks

50
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:57,190
It'll solve our problem

51
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:57,980
No, no...

52
00:04:58,190 --> 00:04:59,690
That’s not what I meant!

53
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:02,560
Ok, I'm done for now!

54
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,770
I think you were a little brash with him

55
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:06,100
What crap!

56
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,230
Tarun!

57
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:08,770
Having painted the silver skies

58
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:12,770
The sun now seeks to hide behind the clouds

59
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:18,140
Having painted the silver skies

60
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:22,140
The sun now seeks to hide behind the clouds

61
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:26,560
The gentle breeze is penning
the beautiful state of my mind

62
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:31,230
Filled with an ink of sweetness

63
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,770
And it seems like he’s savouring their company

64
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,440
Oh what a good morning...!

65
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:40,640
It’s a wonderful day...!

66
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:45,600
The morning raga has begun...!

67
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,980
Oh what a good morning...!

68
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:50,190
It’s a wonderful day...!

69
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:55,150
The morning raga has begun...!

70
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:27,600
In this beautiful world

71
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:32,690
there are smiles aplenty

72
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:37,390
Makes me want to gather
all of life’s beautiful moments

73
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:41,770
and embrace them every day

74
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:47,600
Having held my hand and
brought me this far,

75
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:51,850
life has unfolded a whole new chapter

76
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,980
This new feeling that has now
been evoked in me

77
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:00,770
I now desire to experience each day

78
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:03,100
Oh what a good morning...!

79
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,390
It’s a wonderful day...!

80
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:10,060
The morning raga has begun...!

81
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,440
Oh what a good morning...!

82
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,020
It’s a wonderful day...!

83
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:19,730
The morning raga has begun...!

84
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:25,270
Having painted the silver skies

85
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:29,270
The sun now seeks to hide behind the clouds

86
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:33,600
The gentle breeze is penning the
beautiful state of my mind

87
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:38,270
Filled with an ink of sweetness

88
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:42,850
And It’s a tale I want to listen to

89
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,640
You’ve given me such a useless card...

90
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:51,690
This game won't wrap up
even if we go on till noon!

91
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:53,600
Ok, get on with the game now...

92
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:55,940
Ah,

93
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:01,100
This card is useless, too

94
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:02,600
I don't need any of these

95
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:04,940
Show!

96
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:07,850
So soon?

97
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:10,940
Queen always chooses to be with me!

98
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,600
Yeah, right!

99
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,600
Looks like Tarun is here,
open the door please

100
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,310
Yes

101
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,060
No

102
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:24,270
I’m not moving from here, it’s lucky for me

103
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:25,440
You go open the door

104
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:27,770
Too much!

105
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,980
Such a lazy bum you've become!

106
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:33,310
Come

107
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:34,650
Isn't that Tarun?

108
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:35,690
Yes it is!

109
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,190
It’s ok, leave your shoes on

110
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:39,100
The maid hasn't come to clean yet

111
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:40,940
Oh! She hasn't?

112
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:43,150
Then uncle must be really upset!

113
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:44,900
Nothing of that sort

114
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,560
he’s gloating because,
he’s been winning all the games

115
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:53,100
Hi

116
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:54,060
Look at him,

117
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,810
He won’t move to even open the door,
fearing he’ll lose the lucky streak!

118
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,230
Tarun.. Such a lucky day it's been for me

119
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:03,020
We should've involved some stakes...
would have been more fun!

120
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:05,150
How come you've become so confident?

121
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:06,940
Today is my lucky day!

122
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,310
You know what?
He got seven jokers in one of the games!

123
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,520
Really!

124
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:13,850
I thought a pack of cards had only
six jokers. How did he get seven?

125
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:15,480
Of course there are seven jokers

126
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,350
Shut up now!

127
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,810
Tell me now, how did you
get seven jokers?

128
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:19,560
Ask him to get up from his chair

129
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,230
and you'll find out soon enough!

130
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:22,350
Lucky streak indeed!

131
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:24,520
Ok, move it now!

132
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,310
Ouch... my ear hurts...

133
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:30,520
So many joker cards!

134
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:32,560
At this age, you indulge in
all this cheating!

135
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,940
Like kids!!

136
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:36,640
At this age, we can't have kids for sure

137
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:38,770
At least let's act like them and
have some fun, no!

138
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:41,230
Such crap you speak sometimes,
Feel like hitting you with this!

139
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:42,020
Go on, do it

140
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:42,650
Kill me

141
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:45,440
I'd rather die that way
than to that disease!

142
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:49,060
Oh...C'mon Radha...

143
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:50,810
Uncle...

144
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:53,310
You're cured now, isn't it?

145
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:55,600
Then why rake it up now?

146
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:59,230
What pleasure do you get by
winding her up every day?

147
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,560
What else can we do at this age?

148
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:05,770
Other than pulling each other’s leg,
and making up after silly fights

149
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:07,940
It's the only fun we can have

150
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,560
By the way

151
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:12,770
how come you're dressed in formals today?

152
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:13,730
You're looking dapper

153
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:14,690
Nothing like that

154
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:18,640
I had a meeting with the CA about
the resort, so I'm heading to the city

155
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:19,810
Besides,

156
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:22,650
I have to go to the airport to
pick up a guest

157
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:23,390
So...

158
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,560
Ah! Ok.

159
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:26,270
Also, uncle..

160
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:29,270
I need to talk to you about the resort

161
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,350
I need your opinion

162
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,350
Listen...

163
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:34,890
I have always given you
the same sincere opinion

164
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,350
Go find a life partner

165
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:40,770
A partner who compliments you
completes you

166
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,190
No, please listen to me...

167
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:44,560
There's no second thoughts on that

168
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:47,270
if you go on, you won’t get breakfast and
will have to leave hungry

169
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:49,060
Listen,

170
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,730
let's go have breakfast

171
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:51,980
In case she does serve us that is!

172
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:53,650
I'm famished

173
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:58,690
I've jogged five kilometres this morning!
Do you know that?

174
00:11:58,770 --> 00:11:59,690
Indeed!

175
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:00,560
You're right!

176
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,230
Five kilometres!

177
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:14,020
Why my dear?

178
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,190
Why aren’t you shouting at me today?

179
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:19,560
I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have
mentioned about my illness

180
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,350
What do you want me to do now

181
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,770
Prostrate at your feet and ask for forgiveness?

182
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:25,100
Fine

183
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:26,270
Radha,

184
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,690
show me your dainty feet!

185
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:28,900
That's it

186
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:30,730
I want to reveal everything to him

187
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:33,230
Radha, this is our personal romance...
let it stay between us!

188
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:34,980
I'm not talking about the romance

189
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,900
I will ask him to accompany us
to the hospital tomorrow

190
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,020
Please don't

191
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:39,230
Why not?

192
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,100
Listen,

193
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:42,890
he already has enough worries
to deal with in the resort

194
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:47,140
Besides, the results might
also come out negative, isn't it?

195
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,150
Why do you want to
unnecessarily cause him worry?

196
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:49,690
Oh,

197
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:51,100
so romancing is on!

198
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:52,940
I hope I didn't disturb you two!

199
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,560
No way

200
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:55,890
Tarun,

201
00:12:56,230 --> 00:13:00,560
irrespective of who comes or goes,
our romance is an on-going one

202
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:05,230
Ah! Look at that sexy look she gave me!

203
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:06,890
This...

204
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:09,480
this is what makes me
go weak in my knees

205
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:12,350
Are you sure it's not the 5-km jog...

206
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,020
that made you go weak in the knees!

207
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:17,600
Tarun, please get the plates ready

208
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:19,810
if you let him,
he will go on with his nonsense

209
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:27,310
Hey no no no!!

210
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,600
Oh my God!

211
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:33,600
Sir, please come slowly

212
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,940
Yes, slowly

213
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,230
That is exactly what I also told you...

214
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,850
to come slowly...

215
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:44,640
Don’t you know that, if a cop ask
you to stop, you should do so?

216
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:45,770
Instead, you come and crash into me!

217
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:47,310
Sir, since your white cap was missing,

218
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:48,890
I didn't recognise that you were a cop.

219
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:51,270
I thought someone is asking for a drop,
so I didn’t stop

220
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,190
but you kept coming towards me,
and I crashed into you

221
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:53,940
Sir,

222
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:55,810
don't worry, you're absolutely fine.

223
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:56,770
You idiot!

224
00:13:57,020 --> 00:14:00,730
you crashed into me,
so you should be scared. Not me!

225
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:01,770
Sir,

226
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,850
somehow I've never been scared of cops

227
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:06,020
In fact, I love them. A lot!

228
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:10,560
Since my childhood,
I've always addressed cops as "uncle"

229
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,270
Is that so?

230
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:14,400
Then why don't you
lovingly pass on a 1000 rupee note to me?

231
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,100
But why?

232
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:17,600
Because you flouted rules while driving.
That's why!

233
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:18,150
Sir

234
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,480
the car had a Learner's board on it

235
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:23,230
In that case, since you don't have an L board,
add another Rs 500 and give me Rs 1500

236
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:24,690
Sir, give me a minute

237
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,650
I had pasted it just this morning

238
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:30,850
Oh, It's right here! On your pant

239
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:33,440
I don’t know how it made its way here!
Have a look

240
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,650
Stop with your drama!

241
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:38,980
Why weren't you alert while driving?

242
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:44,850
Ah! Now I get it!
You were busy looking at your girl

243
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:45,640
Sir

244
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:47,060
We're husband and wife, sir

245
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:49,600
Husband and Wife?

246
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:52,600
How dare you say that!

247
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:53,810
Yeah right!

248
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:56,940
In fact, you should be
thanking me for saving you

249
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:00,440
Anyway, seems like you
have conveniently forgotten that

250
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:02,020
I forget you

251
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,600
I forgive you

252
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:06,100
Yeah, yeah

253
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:07,140
forgive you only!

254
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,150
Coming to think of it,
in what way did you save me?

255
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:11,100
What?

256
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:13,940
Had I not stepped in and
spoken to that cop,

257
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:15,770
he’d have got to know
it was you who was driving the car

258
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:17,560
if he had got to know it was me

259
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:20,270
I’d have told him, you disturbed me

260
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,270
so I couldn’t concentrate on road

261
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,190
Then, he’d have thrashed you!

262
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:32,150
Had you concentrated, you’d have realised
some other things too, Swarna

263
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:35,520
Not only do I have to
teach you driving for free

264
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:38,100
but also get an earful from you for helping

265
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:39,850
Do one thing

266
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:44,440
Why don't you call that Dubai Sheikh &
ask him to find you a good driving instructor?

267
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:47,020
Why do you drag him into
all our conversations?

268
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:50,440
I know! Because you want to go to Dubai

269
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:53,100
You’ve got this sudden desire to learn driving

270
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:54,140
Oh really?

271
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:56,850
Then what?

272
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:58,900
You were scared to even sit on a bike

273
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:01,270
Ever since the Dubai proposal has come

274
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:04,770
You’re suddenly interested in
learning to cook and drive

275
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,350
I wasn't scared to sit on a bike

276
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,730
Rather I was scared to sit with you!

277
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:13,850
I haven't yet even got to
speak to him properly

278
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:16,350
and here you are already getting me
married to him

279
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:17,440
Really?

280
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:19,190
So the Dubai proposal
hasn't worked out yet?

281
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:20,850
I didn't say that..

282
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:22,640
The proposal has just come

283
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:25,560
And my aunt was saying that
it seems to be a good match

284
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:27,600
You know what?

285
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:29,140
That boy is self-made just like my father

286
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:31,190
He's worked really hard

287
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:33,890
What rubbish!
As if your father is some millionaire!

288
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:34,690
What?

289
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,020
Go on with what you were saying

290
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:38,600
You know what?

291
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:42,100
He left India with just Rs 5000

292
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:45,190
Today, he's the owner of
two electronic stores

293
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:46,310
What! Electronics store?

294
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:48,560
There's absolutely no profit in that!

295
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:50,890
You know my cousin Vinny, isn't it?

296
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:54,890
He ran his business for just two months.
He shut it down after that

297
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:59,890
In the end, he was left with
just an iron box

298
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:02,980
And it didn't work if there was no power!

299
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:06,940
Had he been around, I'd have made him
narrate his tale to you

300
00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:09,350
Why? Where's he?

301
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,520
He is in hiding

302
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,190
He had many loans to clear, so he ran away

303
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,480
He won't come back any time soon

304
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:18,640
Not everyone is like your cousin Vinny

305
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:21,230
The proposal that’s come to me
is form a very good family

306
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,480
He can marry anyone he chooses to

307
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:28,850
But my aunt was saying they want
a girl who’ll be a good housewife

308
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:31,100
You think everyone comes from a
low class family like yours

309
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:35,810
Hello! All the ladies in my family are
extremely independent

310
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:40,640
Tailoring, embroidery, doll making are
things they pursue to earn money

311
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:44,150
They won’t run off to Dubai
when they get a proposal from there

312
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:47,730
What? Should you say another word,
I'll beat you up!

313
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,600
Did you shift the gear?

314
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:10,690
Yes! But instead of moving forward,
it went in reverse!

315
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:12,560
Come

316
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:23,020
(Popular gourmet song from the movie
'Mayabazar' playing on radio)

317
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,480
Compromise?

318
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:25,850
Ah!

319
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:34,440
I asked you for ideas on how to woo her
and you're listening to the radio!

320
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:37,140
If I have to get ideas

321
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:38,770
I need some inspiration!

322
00:18:58,690 --> 00:18:59,480
Here...

323
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:00,810
A 60 for you and a 60 for me

324
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:02,100
Inspiration!

325
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:03,600
Compliment!

326
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:05,060
I got it!

327
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,390
Got it!

328
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:13,390
What?

329
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,520
I got a good idea!

330
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:15,850
Do one thing!

331
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:18,390
Go and confess your feelings to her

332
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:20,520
To her?

333
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:22,440
Confess everything?

334
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,270
If I had the courage to do so,
why would I ask you for help Kutty?

335
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,480
30. For courage

336
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:53,520
Now there's only one way out

337
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,020
What?

338
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:59,940
The hope for the jobless and the
extremely generous NRI Ismail Bhai!

339
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:01,940
Ismail Bhai?

340
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:03,310
Not just Ismail Bhai.

341
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:04,690
NRI Ismail Bhai!

342
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,310
Swarna!

343
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:09,060
I think Tarun sir is here...

344
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:27,350
Nothing of that sort, sir

345
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:29,600
It's not confirmed yet

346
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:31,020
If everything goes well

347
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:34,230
maybe in November things will be finalised

348
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:35,560
In November?

349
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:42,020
So I have to begin searching for
a new receptionist in six months?

350
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:45,730
Sir, that's what I told you,
nothing is confirmed yet

351
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,390
The way you're blushing right now

352
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,940
it looks like everything
will be confirmed soon

353
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:56,690
Fine

354
00:20:57,150 --> 00:20:59,060
Don't wait until the last moment to tell me

355
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:01,060
Please let me know
as soon as it gets confirmed

356
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:02,640
Have to hire a new receptionist isn't it?

357
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:06,940
And I'm sure you're aware that
it's not easy to find an efficient hand

358
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:10,890
Honest, liberal and intelligent type

359
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:14,890
This time, I'll ensure we hire someone
who's already married!

360
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:18,020
By the way, did you get that room cleaned?

361
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,140
We have some guests coming today...

362
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:21,850
for four days, right?

363
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:22,810
Yes sir

364
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:24,190
The honeymoon suite right?

365
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:25,270
I have got it cleaned

366
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:26,850
Only the decorations remain to be done

367
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:28,310
I'll get it done this noon

368
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,600
So everything will be fresh
when they arrive

369
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:31,560
Ok

370
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:32,940
Where's Pedro?

371
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:33,690
I don't know sir

372
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:34,940
Must be around somewhere

373
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,810
Have you e-mailed the documents to Rajeev?

374
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:55,520
Yes sir

375
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,770
I sent him yesterday

376
00:21:56,810 --> 00:21:58,140
The acknowledgement....

377
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,520
Pedro!!

378
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:01,940
Don't worry. I'm fine

379
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:03,140
Watch where you're going Pedro!

380
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:05,230
She’s getting married soon.
What if something happens to her?

381
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:06,310
Something happens to her?

382
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:07,810
I haven't done anything of that sir...

383
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:08,400
Idiot!

384
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:09,770
Are you blind?

385
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:11,640
You’re drunk early in the morning
and crash into me!

386
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:13,850
Swarna, I don’t like you accusing me of
being drunk at this hour!

387
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:16,520
When you crashed the car this morning,
did I say you were drunk?

388
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:18,900
If you both are done with your crashing stories,
can you go and clean the room?

389
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:20,600
Sir, the rooms have been cleaned

390
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:22,230
Only the decoration is pending

391
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:23,100
Isn’t it Swarna?

392
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:24,020
I know

393
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,980
I’ve already informed sir that
I’ll do it this noon

394
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:29,060
The guests who're coming today
are North Indians

395
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,020
I don't have to specially
explain their kind

396
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:35,690
Even if I get one bad review online,
then you'll see how bad a person I can be!

397
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:39,640
The whole resort has only one booking as of now

398
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:41,270
At least let’s take care of them well!

399
00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:50,640
Swarna, email that British couple &
request them to write a good review

400
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:52,100
They seem to have had a good time with us

401
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:53,440
I will follow up with them

402
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,100
I'll request them to write a good review

403
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:55,900
Sir

404
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:56,850
one more thing

405
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:58,730
The BSNL guys had called

406
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:00,270
Apparently, we haven't paid
the bills this month

407
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:02,600
Pedro, haven't we paid
the bills this month?

408
00:23:02,810 --> 00:23:04,560
Sir, we haven't paid
last month's bill either

409
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:06,190
And the one before that, too

410
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:07,100
Oh!

411
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:09,440
Ok, remind me next month

412
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,060
Hey

413
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:27,810
I hope you guys remember that uncle and
aunty's anniversary party is in two days!

414
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:28,980
Yes sir

415
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:31,390
Kutty and I are already making plans for it

416
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,810
Plan whatever you want

417
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:34,440
but please don't make butter chicken!

418
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:36,190
No sir, we won't

419
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,600
You don't worry sir

420
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:38,690
I'm here to take care of everything

421
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:39,940
I'll direct Kutty on what to do

422
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:41,020
Yeah right

423
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:44,270
it's like one blind man leading the other!

424
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:46,480
Ok then!

425
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,810
Murthy!

426
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:10,650
Ah! Started with this early in the morning!

427
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:13,390
You don't even have the patience
to wait till I leave the house!

428
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:15,350
No Radha. You're getting it all wrong

429
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:18,140
I was just surfing channels.

430
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,770
And by the time I could change to the next,
she came running from one side

431
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,650
and you came running from the other!

432
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:24,150
It's just a coincidence!

433
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:26,480
You've run enough for today

434
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:31,100
This is good

435
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:32,480
Learn some Yoga

436
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,440
Ah!!

437
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,390
Sure, sure

438
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,520
Yoga it is!

439
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:43,770
That's enough.
You don't have to learn Yoga

440
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,940
Go and water the plants

441
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:48,640
And you?

442
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:50,140
Off shopping?

443
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:50,890
Yes

444
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:54,520
To fetch some good health,
wisdom and God's blessings

445
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:55,730
Do you want anything?

446
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:56,810
Listen

447
00:24:56,980 --> 00:25:00,890
You won't find what I want in
your God's supermarket

448
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:01,940
So you can carry on

449
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,350
Damn!

450
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,190
Hello...

451
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:02,940
Hello sir... please tell me

452
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:04,270
Did you have a look at the brochure?

453
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:04,980
Yes, I did

454
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,390
Which is why I called you!

455
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,310
Are you happy?

456
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:09,980
And if you transfer the amount,
I'll also be happy

457
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:12,100
Vinod, What sort of a design is this?

458
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,350
Of the resort, sir

459
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,520
Resort?

460
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:16,270
Seems more like a ghost-ridden bungalow!

461
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:17,730
Sir, please don't scare me!

462
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:18,440
No!

463
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,230
It is me who is actually scared now!

464
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:24,020
After seeing this, the few guests
who’ll be coming to the resort will run away! What then?

465
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:25,900
Sir, please don't be tensed

466
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:27,690
I will change the design and give it to you

467
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:28,810
But please settle the amount

468
00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:29,520
No way!

469
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,310
Say whatever you want to say

470
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,060
unless you do a good job,
I will not pay you!

471
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:37,980
Sir, I'm asking you to settle
the accounts of the previous time

472
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,230
Oh

473
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:40,980
that!

474
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,890
I'll give it to you next time

475
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:44,650
I'm getting a call right now

476
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:45,770
I'll call you later

477
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:46,350
Ok?

478
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:47,100
Bye

479
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:55,270
Compliment

480
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:57,560
[Reads the meaning in Kannada]

481
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:01,100
Compromise

482
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:03,100
[Reads the meaning in Kannada]

483
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:11,230
What are you doing here, Pedro?

484
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:12,600
I'm thinking

485
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:13,690
About what?

486
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:16,650
About what your aunt said

487
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:20,770
I was wondering if she said
compliment or compromise

488
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:24,400
Oh god, it's pronounced as compromise

489
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,810
Foolish fellow!

490
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:27,560
Whatever

491
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:29,190
Didn’t your aunt say

492
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:34,020
That your Dubai Sheikh needs a wife
who will compliment his life?

493
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,980
I was wondering if she said
compliment or compromise

494
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:38,810
Compliment....Compromise....

495
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:40,230
actually what's the big difference anyway?

496
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:41,810
Compliment

497
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:43,350
(Kannada equivalent of compliment)

498
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:44,600
For example

499
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:47,650
if there’s mutual love and respect,
it’s compliment

500
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:48,650
Compromise

501
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,350
(Kannada equivalent of compromise)

502
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:51,730
For example

503
00:28:51,810 --> 00:28:55,640
in a marriage, a wife sacrifices all her dreams
for the sake of her husband

504
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:56,980
That is compromise

505
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:57,850
Now

506
00:28:57,850 --> 00:28:58,940
this Dubai Sheikh will be

507
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:01,890
sitting and conducting business
at his electronics store

508
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:02,770
And his wife?

509
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:05,350
She will be stuck in the kitchen
and only cook food

510
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,310
Washing utensils and all that

511
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:10,100
What do you think of all this?

512
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:12,350
I think you're really clever

513
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:15,020
I know you're being sarcastic

514
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:16,560
No I'm not

515
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:18,480
I'm complimenting you

516
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,350
Compliment

517
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,310
(Kannada equivalent of compliment)

518
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:24,060
Yes, Swarna is praising
the foolish ways of Pedro!

519
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,980
Swarna is praising me? Wow!

520
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:45,600
So

521
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:46,980
what would you like to have?

522
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:50,600
You know by now that
I'm not much of a coffee and tea drinker

523
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,690
That I wouldn't offer you
even if you asked for it!

524
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:55,270
What I meant was

525
00:29:55,850 --> 00:29:57,100
what would you rather hear first?

526
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,810
Good news or bad news?

527
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:02,060
Let's start with bad news

528
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:07,690
You don't have much capital left

529
00:30:07,850 --> 00:30:10,350
On an optimistic note,
your resort might run for another six months

530
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,690
If you sell your car,
maybe an additional four months

531
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:14,850
Ok

532
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,270
Go through this when you are free

533
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:18,690
And then

534
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:22,230
if your business doesn't improve in the
next six months....

535
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,390
If it doesn't improve...??

536
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,230
Now

537
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:28,310
Taneja group is the one and only option

538
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:29,940
What about bank loan?

539
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,100
I checked on that option. It's not possible

540
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:33,480
I tried my best

541
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:37,230
Taneja group is the best and sole option

542
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:39,940
That's not even an option Rajeev

543
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,900
I don't want to turn my resort into a concrete
jungle because of these corporate guidelines

544
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:45,810
Had that been the case,
I'd have done that long ago

545
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,390
I want to run it as per my vision

546
00:30:48,690 --> 00:30:49,770
Think about it and let me know

547
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:51,230
You have another six months

548
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:53,940
If your vision does change, let me know

549
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,600
There's nothing left to think about, Rajeev

550
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:58,480
Let me know if there's another option

551
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:00,640
Ok...

552
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:05,150
By the way, you were talking about
some good news

553
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:05,850
Oh that?

554
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:07,730
I totally forgot

555
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:10,480
My son is getting enrolled in Oxford

556
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,640
He is off to England next month

557
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:14,440
For higher studies

558
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,440
Here, have some sweets

559
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:35,690
Oh

560
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:37,020
Sorry Swarna!

561
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:39,480
I didn't know you were in between
changing outfits

562
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,270
You idiot

563
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:43,440
I was just double folding this bed sheet,
that's all

564
00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:55,730
Swarna, your heart!

565
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:59,270
That heart you’ve readied is beautiful!

566
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:04,480
Are you sweating?

567
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,020
Wait, just give me a minute

568
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:07,940
Now everything will be alright!

569
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,350
Pedro!

570
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,520
I've been working on it
for the past half an hour

571
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,390
and you've destroyed it
in just two seconds!

572
00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:16,600
Bloody moron!

573
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:18,060
Now you only redo it!

574
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:20,020
Swarna, sorry!

575
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,440
I promise I'll put everything back in place

576
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,600
without missing a single petal...

577
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,560
Moron?

578
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:33,690
Worthless fellow, walks around with a dictionary!
To hell with it!!

579
00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:56,190
What have you been upto dude?

580
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,230
The room looks nice and messy...

581
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,310
Mrs Mehra?

582
00:33:21,850 --> 00:33:23,850
I'm very sorry,
I got delayed with the audit...

583
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:25,150
I mean traffic

584
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:27,140
Hope you had a good flight

585
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,810
Where's Mr Mehra?

586
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:34,520
I hope he's not inside the ATM

587
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,060
Because it never works!

588
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:38,140
We'll stop on the way if required

589
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,390
He isn't here. It's just me, We can leave

590
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,850
Mr and Mrs Lobo?

591
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,140
No.

592
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:51,940
Where is Mr Mehra?

593
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:54,350
Is he coming later by any chance?

594
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:09,940
Sorry it's none of my business but...

595
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:12,850
is Mr Mehra joining us any time later?

596
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,310
I need to know a few hours ahead

597
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:21,150
in case any travel arrangements
have to be made

598
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,690
Mrs Mehra, if you can just tell me...

599
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,770
He died two months ago

600
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:30,020
I don't think he'll be joining us

601
00:34:30,810 --> 00:34:32,980
Now that you don't have to plan anything,
can we leave?

602
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:46,270
Hello uncle

603
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:49,390
Yes, I've left the airport and
am on my way now

604
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:51,730
I met the CA

605
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,850
No uncle, nothing has changed

606
00:35:53,850 --> 00:35:55,520
In fact, it has become worse

607
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:58,020
We have to take a decision soon

608
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:00,980
I hope there's some divine intervention

609
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:03,600
If not, we might have to
close down the resort

610
00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:06,270
Ok, sorry

611
00:36:06,770 --> 00:36:07,600
It's not about divine intervention

612
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:10,810
We need to make a decision soon

613
00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:14,060
I'll call you once I'm back

614
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:16,190
Ok, let me do one thing

615
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:17,940
I'll come and meet you

616
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:19,140
That's better

617
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:21,270
Tomorrow afternoon

618
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:22,600
Ok, bye

619
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:28,140
Hope my talk didn't wake you up..

620
00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:32,060
Do you mind if I play the radio?

621
00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:04,730
You can play whichever song you like

622
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:06,770
just because you're playing love songs

623
00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:08,770
I'm not going to jump out of the car
and commit suicide

624
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:10,310
You speak Kannada?

625
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,020
I mean you know the language!

626
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,770
I think so...

627
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:16,560
But your name....

628
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:20,980
Didn’t you men make the rules that the
wife has to take on her husband’s name

629
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:26,940
I was born and raised in North India

630
00:37:27,310 --> 00:37:28,730
But my father is from Mysuru

631
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:33,850
My father used to often say that
Mysureans will give up their life if need be

632
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:35,190
but they will never give up on their language
.

633
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:38,480
So growing up, I spoke a lot of Kannada at home

634
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:41,020
You could have said this in Kannada too,

635
00:37:41,350 --> 00:37:42,190
Anyway,

636
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,230
I'm Tarun

637
00:37:43,310 --> 00:37:44,770
I'm one of the owners of the resort

638
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:45,940
Yeah, I figured

639
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:49,730
Sorry, I overheard you
speaking on the phone

640
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:08,520
Your resort is in a good condition, right?

641
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:09,850
Why?

642
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:12,940
Your conversation on the phone and

643
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:15,900
this brochure...
it's making me a little scared

644
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:19,560
They refuse to do a good job
even if you pay them

645
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:21,190
What do I do?

646
00:38:21,810 --> 00:38:22,890
So tell me

647
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:24,980
what can I do there for four days?

648
00:38:25,810 --> 00:38:27,190
Take a look at that brochure...

649
00:38:29,270 --> 00:38:31,600
There are a lot of interesting places
you can visit

650
00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:33,060
If you look at the brochure

651
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,600
you might be sceptical

652
00:38:34,810 --> 00:38:36,480
But if you go to those places in person

653
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,140
you will like them for sure

654
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,150
We were even featured on Condé Nast
(international travel magazine) you know!

655
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:42,140
Yeah

656
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:45,350
I booked your resort
after seeing that article

657
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:50,190
But on the phone you sounded
as if it is not doing well

658
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:52,230
And when you go through the reviews online

659
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:55,980
a foreign guest wrote he vomited after
eating the butter chicken at your resort

660
00:38:56,650 --> 00:39:00,020
That is because he had downed
eight rounds of the local drink

661
00:39:00,770 --> 00:39:02,270
He kept saying, "I love desi"

662
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,440
What else will happen
if you drink like that?

663
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:07,600
And he blamed the whole fiasco on our food

664
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:09,480
What can I do?

665
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:11,980
Sometimes, time isn't on our side

666
00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:13,480
But then

667
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:15,520
I know good times are around the corner

668
00:39:15,650 --> 00:39:16,980
I’m sure our resort will see
good times, too!

669
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,980
Who knows? May be you brought along
some of those good times for us!

670
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:41,140
Cookie?

671
00:39:41,690 --> 00:39:42,600
No, I'm good

672
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:47,060
If you want me to stop at some place,
please let me know

673
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:17,900
Bathed in the radiance of the new moon
A star has lost its sheen

674
00:40:19,730 --> 00:40:27,940
In the distance echoes the hum
Of a bird in pursuit of a nest

675
00:40:28,850 --> 00:40:35,770
The silver skies are now filled
With the warm glow of daylight

676
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:44,980
The evening sky is adorned with
intoxicating colours

677
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:54,560
The jubilant mind is consumed by the
desire for love

678
00:40:55,980 --> 00:41:05,140
Shall I lose myself on this new journey...

679
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:13,730
And it seems like the green earth and the
azure skies are in agreement

680
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,690
What’s on your mind...

681
00:41:47,310 --> 00:41:48,350
Nothing

682
00:41:51,270 --> 00:41:52,060
I know

683
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,390
what it is that's on your mind..

684
00:41:54,650 --> 00:41:55,480
What?

685
00:41:57,270 --> 00:41:59,690
You must be thinking
what a weird woman right?

686
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:04,980
It's not yet two months
since this woman's husband passed away

687
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:07,980
and she's already come to our resort
to enjoy, isn't it?

688
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:09,900
No, you've got it all wrong

689
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:14,270
Is it so important to mourn openly
and make it obvious to the world?

690
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,810
Even to forget pain

691
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:21,770
the society expects us to follow
its rules and regulations

692
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:23,480
If we smile

693
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:24,850
people will say, look

694
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:27,560
how she's forgotten everything
so quickly and is smiling

695
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:30,980
If you cry,
then they'll say, "look, she's still crying"

696
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:35,150
It's so easy to pass
comments on someone, right?

697
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:38,270
Actually

698
00:42:39,350 --> 00:42:43,140
I didn't want to share
my personal matters with you

699
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:47,190
But you persisted with your questions,
so I had no choice

700
00:42:47,850 --> 00:42:48,810
Also

701
00:42:49,850 --> 00:42:56,140
I’d appreciate if you don't share this with
your staff at the resort

702
00:43:07,770 --> 00:43:10,690
I still have the agony inside me

703
00:43:12,810 --> 00:43:17,690
I’m frustrated to the core, you have no idea

704
00:43:21,350 --> 00:43:24,730
I’m unable to forget the past

705
00:43:27,770 --> 00:43:30,690
Maybe that’s why I’m talking to myself here

706
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:32,480
And even if you can hear me

707
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:34,890
please pretend you can’t

708
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:36,020
That’d be good

709
00:43:40,230 --> 00:43:42,190
No matter how hard we try

710
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:46,100
sometimes it’s not that easy to forget

711
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:48,020
You know when

712
00:43:49,270 --> 00:43:50,520
our prayers

713
00:43:51,190 --> 00:43:53,100
our favourite song

714
00:43:53,690 --> 00:43:55,520
our entire life...

715
00:43:56,060 --> 00:43:58,640
is dedicated to someone

716
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:03,020
how is it possible to forget them
that easily, tell me

717
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:05,560
But you know what?

718
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:09,350
You have to move on

719
00:44:11,230 --> 00:44:12,640
Not for anyone else

720
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:14,600
but for your own good

721
00:44:16,810 --> 00:44:20,270
Or else, the world would have
moved past you

722
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:21,190
But we

723
00:44:22,270 --> 00:44:25,980
Will be stuck in a rut with old memories

724
00:44:28,150 --> 00:44:29,480
On paper yes

725
00:44:29,650 --> 00:44:31,060
we are on our honeymoon

726
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:35,100
But two months ago, tragedy struck

727
00:44:35,810 --> 00:44:37,520
I could’ve cancelled the trip

728
00:44:37,770 --> 00:44:40,310
and wallowed in sympathy

729
00:44:42,190 --> 00:44:43,810
But I chose to move on

730
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:46,350
I chose to come here

731
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:57,190
God this is so weird

732
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:02,940
I didn’t come here to cry

733
00:45:45,190 --> 00:45:53,690
The mind seeks to escape into seclusion
To indulge in some peaceful moments

734
00:45:54,310 --> 00:45:59,940
Solitude is bliss

735
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:12,060
Even Mother Earth resonates my feelings

736
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:18,020
Won’t you do the same my dear Sun?

737
00:46:21,770 --> 00:46:30,270
Lend your ear to my inner voice

738
00:46:31,230 --> 00:46:37,140
And the poem that my eyes narrate

739
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:48,900
Shall I lose myself on this new journey

740
00:46:49,190 --> 00:46:58,520
And it seems the earth and
the azure skies are in agreement

741
00:46:58,650 --> 00:47:15,980
Bathed in the radiance of the new moon
A star has lost its sheen

742
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:59,110
Welcome to Under The Stars, Mrs Mehra

743
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:01,150
I hope you have a pleasant stay with us

744
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:02,400
Welcome madam

745
00:48:05,610 --> 00:48:06,360
Sir,

746
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:08,150
Mr Mehra?

747
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:09,860
He’ll join her later

748
00:48:09,950 --> 00:48:11,990
Apparently he had some urgent meeting to attend

749
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:13,740
Please get her luggage

750
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:14,490
Sir

751
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:16,490
the flowers will wilt soon

752
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:18,320
So, you too welcome to resort sir

753
00:48:20,070 --> 00:48:20,780
Hey!

754
00:48:23,070 --> 00:48:24,450
Shall I show her to the room?

755
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:26,070
It’s already quite late, you leave

756
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:27,200
I’ll do it

757
00:48:27,530 --> 00:48:28,320
It’s ok sir

758
00:48:28,490 --> 00:48:30,070
I’ll stay back even if it gets a little late today

759
00:48:30,150 --> 00:48:31,360
No Swarna, I’ll manage

760
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:32,900
I need to speak to her about something

761
00:48:33,070 --> 00:48:35,530
I have to discuss about her sightseeing trip tomorrow

762
00:48:35,610 --> 00:48:36,240
So...

763
00:48:36,570 --> 00:48:37,610
Is she okay?

764
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:39,530
Why?

765
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:42,200
She seemed a little dull, that’s why

766
00:48:42,530 --> 00:48:43,320
Of course

767
00:48:43,490 --> 00:48:47,240
her husband couldn’t join her
because of some last minute meeting

768
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:48,490
so she is a little upset

769
00:48:48,570 --> 00:48:50,200
How rude of him!

770
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:51,570
That too ditching her at the last minute!

771
00:48:51,650 --> 00:48:52,690
Please speak softly

772
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:54,110
She can understand Kannada

773
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:56,150
Besides, in the business world

774
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:58,190
meetings become more important than attending to family

775
00:48:58,240 --> 00:48:58,940
Sir

776
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:01,570
Is it the same in the
electronic business too?

777
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:07,740
Ok, you leave now.
Let’s meet in the morning

778
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:08,490
Good night

779
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:09,650
Ok sir!

780
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:13,030
So shall we go to the room?

781
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:16,650
I mean, let me show you the room

782
00:49:19,450 --> 00:49:24,280
Oh sorry. Pedro put this saying
flowers will wilt otherwise

783
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:45,740
Oh damn!

784
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:51,820
Sorry!! I’m very sorry!

785
00:49:51,990 --> 00:49:54,900
Just give me ten minutes
and I’ll have this cleared

786
00:49:55,740 --> 00:49:58,440
Or better still, shall I have
you shifted to another room?

787
00:49:59,610 --> 00:50:02,820
I hadn’t mentioned this
issue to any of the staff, so...

788
00:50:03,610 --> 00:50:04,740
Ok, I’ll be fine

789
00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:05,570
Sure?

790
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:07,820
Yeah, I’ll manage

791
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:11,200
Mrs Mehra,

792
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:12,360
what about dinner?

793
00:50:12,530 --> 00:50:14,280
Will you eat at the restaurant or

794
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:15,860
do you want to eat in?

795
00:50:16,450 --> 00:50:18,320
No I’m not hungry

796
00:50:19,070 --> 00:50:21,200
Don’t worry, there’s no
butter chicken on the menu

797
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:22,820
It’s not that

798
00:50:23,110 --> 00:50:25,070
I’m just tired, that’s all

799
00:50:26,530 --> 00:50:27,490
Ok

800
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:37,320
Good night

801
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:41,610
Good night

802
00:50:59,780 --> 00:51:00,570
Kutty

803
00:51:01,820 --> 00:51:03,400
apparently she doesn’t want dinner

804
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:05,740
It’s Thursday, isn’t it?

805
00:51:06,610 --> 00:51:07,780
Maybe she’s fasting

806
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:09,200
So you mean to say

807
00:51:09,740 --> 00:51:11,490
we get to eat all the chicken you’ve made?

808
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:14,820
Here I’m breaking my head
that we’ve run out of booze

809
00:51:14,820 --> 00:51:16,070
And you’re worrying about food!

810
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:19,610
It’s not just the bottles that are empty

811
00:51:20,610 --> 00:51:22,860
even my heart is now empty...

812
00:51:23,610 --> 00:51:25,150
Why?
Is it because of acidity?

813
00:51:25,570 --> 00:51:27,070
Everything is over Kutty...

814
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:28,280
It’s all over...

815
00:51:28,530 --> 00:51:29,780
gone down the drain

816
00:51:30,740 --> 00:51:32,650
Oh god, you’re crying over a
destroyed dictionary!

817
00:51:32,740 --> 00:51:33,990
Not just because of the dictionary

818
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:36,030
Now how will I learn English?

819
00:51:36,530 --> 00:51:38,030
How will I ever go to Dubai?

820
00:51:39,150 --> 00:51:40,900
Who said English is a must to go to Dubai?

821
00:51:41,030 --> 00:51:41,740
Then?

822
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:44,360
Remember I was talking about our NRI Ismail Bhai?

823
00:51:44,780 --> 00:51:47,570
He didn’t know a word of English
while he was going to Dubai

824
00:51:48,030 --> 00:51:50,400
If you asked him A for?
He’d reply A for Cat

825
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:51,610
Hahaha!

826
00:51:51,990 --> 00:51:52,990
But look at him now!

827
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:56,030
He’s a big janitor in Dubai
and has made lots of money

828
00:51:56,450 --> 00:51:57,490
I see

829
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:02,650
Listen

830
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:04,740
what do you mean by janitor?

831
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:08,820
Actually, even I don’t know

832
00:52:09,070 --> 00:52:10,070
But

833
00:52:10,150 --> 00:52:13,110
I’m sure that it’s a very high post

834
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:14,860
How else did he make so much money, then?

835
00:52:15,110 --> 00:52:16,400
The last time he came

836
00:52:16,650 --> 00:52:19,610
he had gold biscuits in his shoes

837
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:20,570
Oh my!

838
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:23,360
Gold biscuits?

839
00:52:36,450 --> 00:52:37,200
Kutty

840
00:52:37,570 --> 00:52:38,530
look at this

841
00:52:42,150 --> 00:52:43,570
I’m sorry

842
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:45,320
being road

843
00:52:46,570 --> 00:52:47,650
What does it mean?

844
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:51,690
What rubbish! It’s not road

845
00:52:52,110 --> 00:52:54,530
It’s roodey

846
00:52:59,570 --> 00:53:01,320
Roodey

847
00:53:04,030 --> 00:53:05,190
roodey?

848
00:53:28,860 --> 00:53:32,070
I know you don’t like it when I drink

849
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:35,940
But it’s been so long since you left me alone, no?

850
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:37,490
It is to celebrate that

851
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:40,320
I mean I'm sorry

852
00:53:41,110 --> 00:53:42,530
I'm sad...

853
00:53:42,610 --> 00:53:44,070
It’s just wine

854
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:50,990
Wasn't it you who said

855
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:54,900
Follow your dreams

856
00:53:55,450 --> 00:53:57,700
Without worrying about anything else...

857
00:54:01,030 --> 00:54:02,690
Remember that?

858
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:08,440
I am doing the same...

859
00:54:09,530 --> 00:54:11,280
But see..

860
00:54:12,570 --> 00:54:15,650
Now I have to worry about everything

861
00:54:16,490 --> 00:54:17,860
That too all alone...

862
00:54:25,110 --> 00:54:28,360
I didn’t even realise when
you left me behind and moved on

863
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:33,400
Had I known it,
I’d have stopped you for sure

864
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:35,860
At least I’d have tried

865
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:44,320
I seriously miss you man

866
00:54:48,110 --> 00:54:50,860
I can’t even ask you
when you will return

867
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:54,070
I can only try

868
00:54:55,990 --> 00:54:57,650
Weren’t you the one
who used to say that

869
00:54:58,860 --> 00:55:02,150
If you try hard enough,
you can get anything in this world?

870
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:08,030
But today I realised

871
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:15,900
However hard you try there are many things
you can't get in this world

872
00:55:20,110 --> 00:55:21,320
I'll keep trying

873
00:56:16,820 --> 00:56:23,400
Whilst turning the chapter of life

874
00:56:23,570 --> 00:56:30,200
Memories return, sometimes to haunt, sometimes not

875
00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:38,150
Apprehension envelopes me when I revisit old memories

876
00:56:38,740 --> 00:56:44,860
Even as colours of the sunset linger in my mind

877
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:59,570
Pacy emotions, a confused heart, this looks like a never ending tale

878
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:35,110
Won’t you engulf me
and caress my heart oh brilliant light...

879
00:57:35,860 --> 00:57:42,360
Won’t you surprise me like you do often?

880
00:57:43,110 --> 00:57:46,360
In the depths of my soul

881
00:57:46,820 --> 00:57:49,650
This is a voice that haunts me

882
00:57:50,450 --> 00:57:56,780
When I was hopeless while at crossroads

883
00:57:56,780 --> 00:58:11,070
I found hope in the dazzling dreams that took flight

884
00:58:32,610 --> 00:58:38,030
Happy Birthday to you!

885
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:40,900
Happy Birthday dear Tanya!

886
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:45,990
Happy Birthday to you!

887
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:48,650
Wake up sleepy head

888
00:58:48,650 --> 00:58:50,780
It's your birthday!

889
00:58:51,450 --> 00:58:54,610
Akash! What is this?

890
00:58:55,610 --> 00:58:58,940
Cake! I hope it's not too sweet

891
00:59:00,360 --> 00:59:03,150
What! Don’t give me that look

892
00:59:03,490 --> 00:59:07,150
You know I always give you
polite constructive criticism

893
00:59:17,860 --> 00:59:18,740
Akash!

894
00:59:23,030 --> 00:59:25,070
Akash! What's this?

895
00:59:26,860 --> 00:59:30,570
Will you marry me?

896
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:36,190
That's not even how you say it.
But...

897
00:59:36,650 --> 00:59:39,360
You know whatever you ask
I'm gonna say yes...

898
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:40,320
Yes!

899
00:59:40,610 --> 00:59:42,320
Yes.. Come here!

900
01:00:42,770 --> 01:00:43,770
Hey

901
01:00:43,900 --> 01:00:44,900
you're up already!

902
01:00:44,980 --> 01:00:46,020
Yeah

903
01:00:46,060 --> 01:00:48,640
I'm searching if I can find any other
complaints in your resort!

904
01:00:48,650 --> 01:00:49,600
Oh!

905
01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:52,270
For polite constructive criticism!

906
01:00:52,310 --> 01:00:53,520
Yes!

907
01:00:55,100 --> 01:00:57,020
How are you feeling today?

908
01:00:57,190 --> 01:00:57,980
Why?

909
01:00:58,270 --> 01:00:59,850
Do I look depressed?

910
01:00:59,980 --> 01:01:00,600
No

911
01:01:00,650 --> 01:01:01,900
You look happy!

912
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:04,810
Now you know why we're
featured on Condé Nast!

913
01:01:07,980 --> 01:01:10,230
Also, breakfast is ready, Mrs Mehra

914
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:12,150
Do you want to have it now or later?

915
01:01:12,190 --> 01:01:13,190
Tanya

916
01:01:13,900 --> 01:01:14,480
Oh!

917
01:01:14,770 --> 01:01:15,480
Tanya

918
01:01:15,980 --> 01:01:16,770
Breakfast?

919
01:01:31,150 --> 01:01:34,230
So you've decided to move to Kanpur?

920
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:35,520
Not sure

921
01:01:35,690 --> 01:01:36,940
I'm considering it

922
01:01:37,980 --> 01:01:39,520
Too many memories?

923
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:40,600
Yeah

924
01:01:41,310 --> 01:01:42,690
That's also one of the reasons

925
01:01:43,190 --> 01:01:44,140
But

926
01:01:45,060 --> 01:01:47,850
I can't decide if I should
run away from the memories

927
01:01:48,190 --> 01:01:51,890
or embrace them and live peacefully

928
01:01:52,850 --> 01:01:55,020
What do your parents think?

929
01:01:55,310 --> 01:01:56,850
Do they want to live in Kanpur?

930
01:01:56,980 --> 01:01:58,230
Or return back home?

931
01:01:58,230 --> 01:01:59,390
Coffee...
Initially...

932
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:00,730
Thank you

933
01:02:02,900 --> 01:02:06,100
Initially, my father wanted
to move back to Mysuru

934
01:02:06,270 --> 01:02:09,400
But my mother wasn't ready to
leave Kanpur and come

935
01:02:09,940 --> 01:02:12,640
You know, to leave behind the house,
relatives, North India and all that

936
01:02:12,690 --> 01:02:14,600
She just wasn't very comfortable

937
01:02:15,270 --> 01:02:17,480
So when I decided to live there

938
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:20,020
My father decided to buy
an apartment in Kanpur

939
01:02:20,940 --> 01:02:24,100
They felt it'd be easier to come and
visit their daughter and son-in-law

940
01:02:25,980 --> 01:02:27,230
It's strange, right?

941
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:29,350
In charting the future of their kids

942
01:02:29,480 --> 01:02:31,060
our parents forget to live their own lives

943
01:02:32,350 --> 01:02:33,230
Coffee?

944
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:35,520
Yes, please

945
01:02:38,560 --> 01:02:40,230
Did you like the breakfast?

946
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:44,020
You'll know when you read the review!

947
01:02:46,270 --> 01:02:47,600
No sugar for me please!

948
01:02:48,850 --> 01:02:49,850
I'm so sorry!

949
01:02:50,150 --> 01:02:51,600
I should've asked you
before I poured you coffee!

950
01:02:51,730 --> 01:02:55,310
Just a habit, you know. 
Akash used to always have two spoons

951
01:02:57,560 --> 01:02:59,140
Forget that. Let's not talk about it

952
01:02:59,230 --> 01:03:00,350
I will ask for another coffee

953
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:01,600
Hey, that's ok

954
01:03:02,350 --> 01:03:05,190
I'm sure the man you made
the coffee for was a great guy

955
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:06,600
Out of respect for him

956
01:03:06,650 --> 01:03:08,310
I'll drink it as it is

957
01:03:08,650 --> 01:03:09,480
Sure?

958
01:03:09,770 --> 01:03:10,850
Yes

959
01:03:22,730 --> 01:03:23,480
Listen up!

960
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:24,350
You know what?

961
01:03:25,060 --> 01:03:27,480
Tarun sir had his coffee with sugar today!

962
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:28,140
Huh?

963
01:03:28,190 --> 01:03:29,140
Indeed!

964
01:03:29,940 --> 01:03:31,480
And you know who put the sugar for him?

965
01:03:32,190 --> 01:03:33,020
Mrs Mehra!

966
01:03:33,850 --> 01:03:34,480
Oh...

967
01:03:34,900 --> 01:03:39,480
I think there'll be a huge ruckus
when Mr Mehra gets here!

968
01:03:39,690 --> 01:03:40,690
What's up guys?

969
01:03:41,810 --> 01:03:45,020
Tarun sir had his coffee with sugar, today

970
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:46,770
The reason is simple

971
01:03:47,480 --> 01:03:48,770
The person who stirred in the sugar was...

972
01:03:48,940 --> 01:03:49,980
Mrs Mehra!

973
01:03:51,270 --> 01:03:52,480
Please don't speak nonsense!

974
01:03:52,770 --> 01:03:54,190
She's already married!

975
01:03:54,440 --> 01:03:56,020
And her husband will be
here in a day or two

976
01:03:56,230 --> 01:03:56,890
Please remember that

977
01:03:56,980 --> 01:03:58,480
That's why even I am panicking!

978
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:03,400
Besides, what's the big deal about 
Tarun sir drinking coffee with sugar anyway?

979
01:04:04,270 --> 01:04:05,690
Of course, it is special

980
01:04:05,940 --> 01:04:09,100
Last time when Kutty served
him coffee with sugar

981
01:04:09,310 --> 01:04:12,440
He almost threw it on Kutty's face

982
01:04:12,900 --> 01:04:15,230
And our Kutty was so depressed 
because of that!

983
01:04:15,310 --> 01:04:16,140
Really?

984
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:19,270
Idiot, she didn't know anything about it,
And you had to mention it...

985
01:04:19,310 --> 01:04:20,600
Oh shut up Kutty!

986
01:04:20,650 --> 01:04:22,400
I told her purposely so she knows about it

987
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:25,770
Maybe Tarun sir felt like
drinking coffee with sugar today

988
01:04:25,850 --> 01:04:27,140
So he did. That's about it

989
01:04:27,900 --> 01:04:28,940
Yes Kutty

990
01:04:29,150 --> 01:04:31,230
Sometimes, even if things are obvious

991
01:04:31,270 --> 01:04:32,770
we are blind to it

992
01:04:32,980 --> 01:04:34,730
We understand everything rather late

993
01:04:46,900 --> 01:04:47,850
Good morning, ma'am!

994
01:04:47,940 --> 01:04:48,940
Good morning!!

995
01:04:49,940 --> 01:04:51,890
Looks like there aren't
any other guests in the resort...

996
01:04:52,020 --> 01:04:53,270
Surprising isn't it?

997
01:04:53,350 --> 01:04:54,230
Hmmm...

998
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:55,230
Yes

999
01:04:55,940 --> 01:05:00,190
But I'm surprised that you have come here alone

1000
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:01,560
So

1001
01:05:01,850 --> 01:05:03,640
When is your husband joining you?

1002
01:05:04,690 --> 01:05:06,390
May be in a day or two

1003
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:08,810
He is abroad on a business meeting

1004
01:05:08,940 --> 01:05:09,390
Oh

1005
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:10,440
Abroad!

1006
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:11,480
Where?

1007
01:05:11,770 --> 01:05:12,650
Dubai

1008
01:05:12,770 --> 01:05:14,020
Dubai!

1009
01:05:14,650 --> 01:05:16,560
Have you ever been there?

1010
01:05:16,770 --> 01:05:17,270
Yeah

1011
01:05:17,350 --> 01:05:18,270
A few times...

1012
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:19,140
Wow!

1013
01:05:19,730 --> 01:05:21,390
The next time you're in Dubai,

1014
01:05:21,480 --> 01:05:23,440
you must come home for lunch!

1015
01:05:23,770 --> 01:05:25,480
You have a house in Dubai?

1016
01:05:25,650 --> 01:05:26,940
Sort of...

1017
01:05:26,980 --> 01:05:28,190
Hey,

1018
01:05:28,810 --> 01:05:30,060
Not just a house

1019
01:05:30,150 --> 01:05:33,060
She also has two electronic showrooms,
a car and a dog

1020
01:05:33,810 --> 01:05:34,390
Really?

1021
01:05:34,560 --> 01:05:36,980
Apparently, there's nobody to feed the dog,
so she is going

1022
01:05:37,190 --> 01:05:38,310
Sir please!

1023
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:39,940
Actually, nothing is fixed yet

1024
01:05:40,310 --> 01:05:40,980
Come, let's go

1025
01:05:41,060 --> 01:05:43,190
Or else she'll never be done
with her Dubai tales

1026
01:05:44,940 --> 01:05:45,730
Bye

1027
01:05:49,060 --> 01:05:51,270
They both look so cute together, right?

1028
01:05:52,350 --> 01:05:55,640
If only she wasn't married....

1029
01:05:57,060 --> 01:05:59,890
You two also make an equally cute pair!

1030
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:08,390
Oh god! Look at the way you're blushing!

1031
01:06:09,980 --> 01:06:11,140
How far is it from here?

1032
01:06:11,190 --> 01:06:11,730
Huh?

1033
01:06:11,980 --> 01:06:12,980
How far is it?

1034
01:06:13,770 --> 01:06:16,190
About 15 kilometres

1035
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:18,140
But since the roads are good

1036
01:06:18,230 --> 01:06:20,140
it will take about 40 minutes!

1037
01:06:32,850 --> 01:06:34,770
Just for the record

1038
01:06:35,900 --> 01:06:38,730
that British couple who stayed with us...

1039
01:06:39,350 --> 01:06:41,270
have given us a five-star rating!

1040
01:06:41,980 --> 01:06:43,600
Aha!

1041
01:06:44,230 --> 01:06:48,690
Looks like I've brought luck to you...
I mean your resort!

1042
01:06:49,810 --> 01:06:51,190
Probably

1043
01:06:52,770 --> 01:06:54,980
But please don't take it with you
when you leave!

1044
01:06:55,190 --> 01:06:56,440
Will be tough then!

1045
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:57,980
No, no don't worry

1046
01:06:58,520 --> 01:07:00,020
When I leave

1047
01:07:00,150 --> 01:07:02,020
I'll only take my luggage with me

1048
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:03,150
Promise

1049
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:09,980
Excuse me!

1050
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:12,310
What happened?

1051
01:07:12,310 --> 01:07:13,600
One minute...

1052
01:07:19,560 --> 01:07:21,940
Who is calling you? Just answer it!

1053
01:07:22,190 --> 01:07:23,480
Why the hurry?

1054
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:25,230
I'll talk later. Come, let's go

1055
01:07:27,190 --> 01:07:28,100
Hello!

1056
01:07:29,900 --> 01:07:30,900
Tarun...

1057
01:07:31,100 --> 01:07:32,020
Tarun, what a surprise!

1058
01:07:32,100 --> 01:07:33,640
Somebody wasn't answering my call

1059
01:07:33,730 --> 01:07:35,980
So I decided to meet them face to face

1060
01:07:36,770 --> 01:07:37,810
What are you doing here

1061
01:07:38,060 --> 01:07:39,060
near a hospital?

1062
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:41,270
Just a casual visit

1063
01:07:41,350 --> 01:07:43,230
Aunty, I know you won't lie to me

1064
01:07:43,310 --> 01:07:45,060
Please tell me the truth

1065
01:07:45,150 --> 01:07:47,020
Doctor asked us to
get a check up done

1066
01:07:47,100 --> 01:07:48,190
So we're here

1067
01:07:48,310 --> 01:07:48,890
Why?

1068
01:07:48,940 --> 01:07:50,350
He wants to clear some doubt

1069
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:51,940
so he said it's better to get it checked

1070
01:07:51,980 --> 01:07:53,480
And you call this a casual visit??

1071
01:07:53,560 --> 01:07:54,140
Sorry

1072
01:07:54,150 --> 01:07:55,270
Is everything ok?

1073
01:07:55,350 --> 01:07:57,440
Everything is ok, except this man's head!

1074
01:07:57,810 --> 01:07:59,350
Just doesn't listen to anyone!

1075
01:07:59,480 --> 01:08:00,940
Please don't be afraid,

1076
01:08:01,060 --> 01:08:04,270
the man he's referring as mad is me, Murthy

1077
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:05,310
I am Tarun's uncle

1078
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:06,650
Hi uncle. I am Tanya

1079
01:08:06,690 --> 01:08:07,690
Hi

1080
01:08:08,230 --> 01:08:10,690
My dear, he keeps accusing me of
not listening to anyone

1081
01:08:10,810 --> 01:08:14,980
But does he keep us informed
about his whereabouts?

1082
01:08:15,230 --> 01:08:18,100
Tanya and I are going sightseeing

1083
01:08:19,810 --> 01:08:21,230
By the way, Tanya

1084
01:08:21,350 --> 01:08:22,270
I completely forgot

1085
01:08:22,310 --> 01:08:23,140
This is Radha

1086
01:08:23,190 --> 01:08:24,310
My better half

1087
01:08:25,060 --> 01:08:25,810
Radha

1088
01:08:25,810 --> 01:08:29,140
Tanya and Tarun are going "sightseeing"

1089
01:08:30,310 --> 01:08:32,640
Tanya, is a guest at our resort

1090
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:35,060
The one I went to the airport
to pick up yesterday

1091
01:08:35,270 --> 01:08:36,270
Yes, that's her

1092
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:37,270
Tanya

1093
01:08:38,060 --> 01:08:38,810
Tanya,

1094
01:08:38,940 --> 01:08:41,190
I'll tell Pedro to come and pick you up

1095
01:08:41,270 --> 01:08:42,400
He'll show you around

1096
01:08:42,440 --> 01:08:43,560
I have to be with my uncle

1097
01:08:43,690 --> 01:08:44,440
Tarun

1098
01:08:44,480 --> 01:08:45,980
Why complicate matters?

1099
01:08:46,150 --> 01:08:48,020
I'll take Tanya home along with me

1100
01:08:48,190 --> 01:08:50,600
You'll anyway come home
to drop uncle isn't it?

1101
01:08:50,770 --> 01:08:52,770
Let's have lunch together

1102
01:08:52,900 --> 01:08:54,270
You can go sightseeing after that

1103
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:56,560
Besides, it's always nice to go
sightseeing in the evening

1104
01:08:56,650 --> 01:08:57,270
Hmm... that...

1105
01:08:57,350 --> 01:08:58,770
No arguments! It's decided

1106
01:08:58,850 --> 01:08:59,600
Tanya

1107
01:08:59,650 --> 01:09:00,850
Come home with me

1108
01:09:00,850 --> 01:09:03,440
I'll make you some nice coffee.

1109
01:09:04,060 --> 01:09:05,270
Carry on

1110
01:09:05,400 --> 01:09:05,940
Tanya

1111
01:09:06,020 --> 01:09:06,560
Come

1112
01:09:06,900 --> 01:09:07,810
See you!

1113
01:09:11,810 --> 01:09:12,890
What?

1114
01:09:13,060 --> 01:09:13,980
Nothing!

1115
01:09:14,100 --> 01:09:15,940
Jeez! Tanya is a guest at our resort!

1116
01:09:16,060 --> 01:09:18,850
Hello! Did I even bring that matter up?!

1117
01:09:19,060 --> 01:09:20,520
Come

1118
01:09:32,770 --> 01:09:33,900
Coffee!

1119
01:09:34,230 --> 01:09:35,480
Thanks aunty!

1120
01:09:37,850 --> 01:09:39,480
Aunty, where did you buy this?

1121
01:09:39,650 --> 01:09:40,690
Jordan

1122
01:09:41,100 --> 01:09:41,980
You liked it?

1123
01:09:42,100 --> 01:09:43,480
Yeah, a lot!

1124
01:09:47,770 --> 01:09:49,810
So you've travelled all over?

1125
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:52,100
Not all over

1126
01:09:52,230 --> 01:09:53,230
But a lot

1127
01:09:55,190 --> 01:09:57,310
Since it's just the two of us,
we have time on our hands

1128
01:09:57,310 --> 01:09:58,390
We don't have kids...

1129
01:09:59,020 --> 01:10:00,100
So....

1130
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:02,150
Like that!

1131
01:10:04,060 --> 01:10:05,730
We wanted to go to Hawaii

1132
01:10:05,770 --> 01:10:06,770
Hawaii!

1133
01:10:06,810 --> 01:10:07,940
Yes

1134
01:10:08,650 --> 01:10:10,150
There's that song, right...

1135
01:10:10,520 --> 01:10:12,020
Something about the rainbow....

1136
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:13,230
the....

1137
01:10:13,310 --> 01:10:14,640
Somewhere

1138
01:10:14,810 --> 01:10:17,020
over the rainbow...

1139
01:10:17,230 --> 01:10:19,480
blue birds fly....

1140
01:10:22,230 --> 01:10:22,810
That's the one...

1141
01:10:22,850 --> 01:10:24,190
It's Murthy's favourite song

1142
01:10:24,350 --> 01:10:24,890
Wow!

1143
01:10:24,980 --> 01:10:26,690
Their colourful culture,

1144
01:10:26,810 --> 01:10:27,690
blue skies,

1145
01:10:27,770 --> 01:10:28,690
sandy beaches...

1146
01:10:28,900 --> 01:10:31,600
We had even booked our tickets

1147
01:10:32,150 --> 01:10:33,940
But then we got to know that

1148
01:10:34,310 --> 01:10:35,980
Murthy has cancer.

1149
01:10:37,270 --> 01:10:38,400
We'll be getting the reports tomorrow.

1150
01:10:39,230 --> 01:10:41,690
Everything should be clear

1151
01:10:41,980 --> 01:10:43,940
That's all I want

1152
01:10:44,150 --> 01:10:46,600
Aunty, I'm sure everything will be fine

1153
01:10:46,770 --> 01:10:50,440
You both will soon be drinking Mai Tai 
(a popular drink) in Hawaii

1154
01:10:51,650 --> 01:10:52,770
Thank you, Tanya

1155
01:10:52,810 --> 01:10:54,350
Tarun has promised us the same

1156
01:10:54,690 --> 01:10:56,890
He said he'll take us there.

1157
01:10:59,060 --> 01:11:00,770
Oh my god, aunty!

1158
01:11:01,190 --> 01:11:03,350
You are glowing in this picture!

1159
01:11:03,350 --> 01:11:04,890
You look so happy!

1160
01:11:07,850 --> 01:11:10,140
We clicked this in Kenya

1161
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:12,100
We were returning from Safari

1162
01:11:12,270 --> 01:11:13,850
Everybody was getting
their pictures taken

1163
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:15,440
Murthy suggested we get our picture taken too,

1164
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:17,270
I said ok and posed for the picture

1165
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:20,650
And just then Murthy
surprised me with a hug!

1166
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:24,980
If he does this in front of all,
won't I be shocked?

1167
01:11:25,150 --> 01:11:26,690
Didn't you shout at him?

1168
01:11:26,940 --> 01:11:28,890
But how can you shout at someone like Murthy!

1169
01:11:28,980 --> 01:11:31,440
So sweet, he looks like a baby here!

1170
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:32,770
But I didn't let him off that easily

1171
01:11:32,940 --> 01:11:34,020
I yelled at him

1172
01:11:34,440 --> 01:11:36,140
and asked him what made him do that

1173
01:11:36,940 --> 01:11:38,730
Apparently he read somewhere that

1174
01:11:39,350 --> 01:11:41,850
if a boy hugs his girl like this

1175
01:11:42,150 --> 01:11:43,770
it completes a circle

1176
01:11:43,940 --> 01:11:45,640
His and hers

1177
01:11:46,020 --> 01:11:47,480
It's a circle of warmth

1178
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:48,400
togetherness

1179
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:49,310
love

1180
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:51,900
and it completes her world

1181
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:53,940
And in this world

1182
01:11:54,100 --> 01:11:57,940
the woman is free to spread her wings
and fly to any height she wants to

1183
01:11:58,440 --> 01:12:00,690
Murthy said something else after this

1184
01:12:00,810 --> 01:12:02,100
Look...

1185
01:12:03,150 --> 01:12:05,900
You are the centre of my universe...

1186
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:08,810
Wow!

1187
01:12:12,770 --> 01:12:15,440
I hate sitting and waiting like this!

1188
01:12:15,980 --> 01:12:17,980
How long do we have to wait!

1189
01:12:18,060 --> 01:12:19,690
Time just doesn't seem to pass

1190
01:12:20,150 --> 01:12:21,520
Yes, I'm sure

1191
01:12:21,940 --> 01:12:23,940
But should you have been
sitting on a park bench

1192
01:12:24,020 --> 01:12:27,310
you would've had no trouble
passing time ogling at all the girls

1193
01:12:27,350 --> 01:12:28,390
..right?

1194
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:29,440
No, no

1195
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:31,480
That's not what I meant

1196
01:12:31,690 --> 01:12:33,100
Then what did you mean?

1197
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:35,810
I was feeling bad to make you wait here

1198
01:12:35,940 --> 01:12:39,980
Instead of you going sightseeing with that girl...

1199
01:12:40,350 --> 01:12:41,310
Uncle,

1200
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:42,690
she is our guest at the hotel

1201
01:12:42,770 --> 01:12:45,770
And I was just taking her out
to see some places, that's it!

1202
01:12:47,810 --> 01:12:49,100
That's it?

1203
01:12:51,100 --> 01:12:51,730
Yes, that's it!

1204
01:12:51,770 --> 01:12:52,600
Murthy...

1205
01:12:53,100 --> 01:12:54,100
Coming!

1206
01:13:07,810 --> 01:13:08,440
Aunty...

1207
01:13:09,480 --> 01:13:11,810
How did you meet uncle?

1208
01:13:12,770 --> 01:13:14,190
That's a long story

1209
01:13:14,810 --> 01:13:15,980
You can call it destiny

1210
01:13:18,900 --> 01:13:20,650
I was just 18 then

1211
01:13:21,810 --> 01:13:27,770
The first time I saw him,
I fell in love...

1212
01:13:31,150 --> 01:13:33,650
I felt like seeing him often

1213
01:13:34,270 --> 01:13:35,850
But that wasn't possible

1214
01:13:37,100 --> 01:13:38,690
My heart was wounded

1215
01:13:38,940 --> 01:13:40,560
But there was no balm to soothe it

1216
01:13:41,230 --> 01:13:43,310
Even if I wanted to go meet him,
that wasn't possible

1217
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:45,140
Ours was an orthodox family

1218
01:13:45,310 --> 01:13:47,730
They wouldn't let me
step out unaccompanied

1219
01:13:48,310 --> 01:13:49,140
Then?

1220
01:13:50,350 --> 01:13:52,640
Then one day, I found the balm
to soothe my wound

1221
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:55,150
I was buying vegetables at the bazar

1222
01:13:55,900 --> 01:13:57,350
And I saw him there

1223
01:13:58,060 --> 01:14:00,060
We exchanged smiles

1224
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:03,640
And thus started our talks

1225
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:08,980
We behaved as if we were the
only ones in this whole world

1226
01:14:09,560 --> 01:14:11,730
The first time he held my hand

1227
01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:13,940
The first time he kissed my cheeks

1228
01:14:15,480 --> 01:14:17,350
We soon started dreaming
of a future together

1229
01:14:17,810 --> 01:14:18,770
Wow..

1230
01:14:19,940 --> 01:14:21,100
And then?

1231
01:14:21,690 --> 01:14:23,140
And then..

1232
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:29,400
Soon my father came to me with a proposal

1233
01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:33,060
He asked me to marry a boy of his choice

1234
01:14:37,690 --> 01:14:38,940
And then?

1235
01:14:40,020 --> 01:14:43,270
I wanted to inform my man of this matter

1236
01:14:43,940 --> 01:14:46,060
But I just couldn't meet him

1237
01:14:47,350 --> 01:14:49,770
I didn't know what to do

1238
01:14:54,480 --> 01:14:55,600
And then...

1239
01:14:56,230 --> 01:14:58,310
I married the man
my father showed me

1240
01:14:58,400 --> 01:14:59,150
What?

1241
01:14:59,810 --> 01:15:01,850
And now I have spent 30 years with him

1242
01:15:02,190 --> 01:15:04,190
Aunty!! I don't believe this!

1243
01:15:04,810 --> 01:15:06,390
Didn't you find it tough?

1244
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:07,480
In the beginning it was...

1245
01:15:08,020 --> 01:15:09,440
I won't deny that

1246
01:15:10,310 --> 01:15:11,730
But everything became alright later

1247
01:15:12,980 --> 01:15:14,770
Where did I keep the monky jack?

1248
01:15:14,900 --> 01:15:17,600
Aunty, sorry if I made you uncomfortable

1249
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:19,850
Hey, please...
I was just asking...

1250
01:15:22,690 --> 01:15:23,480
Ah! Got it!

1251
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:24,940
You found the monky jack?

1252
01:15:25,060 --> 01:15:26,480
No, the tamarind!

1253
01:15:30,150 --> 01:15:31,350
Smells good, aunty!

1254
01:15:32,690 --> 01:15:37,850
There's no guarantee you
will get what you desire in life

1255
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:42,640
But you might end up getting something
better than what you desire.

1256
01:15:50,650 --> 01:15:52,150
I guess!

1257
01:15:58,350 --> 01:16:01,890
Words unsaid are beating to a rhythm

1258
01:16:02,350 --> 01:16:09,980
Teasing those old dear memories

1259
01:16:10,350 --> 01:16:13,940
Mystic river that the mind is

1260
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:17,810
It's caught in a swirl of emotions

1261
01:16:18,310 --> 01:16:21,310
How are you able to contain it?

1262
01:16:22,310 --> 01:16:25,850
Listen to me oh dear heart

1263
01:16:26,310 --> 01:16:29,850
Bring back the lost smile

1264
01:16:30,350 --> 01:16:33,140
with all the zeal and zest

1265
01:16:38,350 --> 01:16:41,850
Words unsaid are beating to a rhythm

1266
01:16:42,310 --> 01:16:49,940
And a new realization has dawned upon me

1267
01:16:50,310 --> 01:16:53,850
From the isle of dreams

1268
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:58,100
should I fetch you a beautiful life?

1269
01:16:58,350 --> 01:17:01,060
adorned with love

1270
01:17:12,230 --> 01:17:13,480
What are you watching, Swarna?

1271
01:17:14,980 --> 01:17:16,310
Oh this?

1272
01:17:16,520 --> 01:17:19,150
I've watched it, too. Such a bad film!

1273
01:17:21,900 --> 01:17:24,230
Just accept that you didn’t
understand the film!

1274
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:26,100
The movie is really nice

1275
01:17:26,770 --> 01:17:27,940
What is so nice about it?

1276
01:17:28,150 --> 01:17:29,980
She's dumped by her husband
yet she goes abroad

1277
01:17:30,020 --> 01:17:31,230
for her honeymoon

1278
01:17:31,310 --> 01:17:32,600
That too alone

1279
01:17:33,480 --> 01:17:35,520
How can it be called a honeymoon
if she's gone alone?

1280
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:36,850
It should be called 'Shani-Moon'

1281
01:17:36,980 --> 01:17:38,230
Look at her, Pedro

1282
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:41,690
She's a role model for the
girls of this nation

1283
01:17:41,980 --> 01:17:45,890
She has proved to male chauvinistic like you
that girls can lead an independent life

1284
01:17:46,060 --> 01:17:47,060
Yeah, yeah

1285
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:52,440
Is that why you are trying to impress that
Dubai Sheikh of yours by learning to drive?

1286
01:17:52,850 --> 01:17:55,140
I can't make you understand
these things, so let it be!

1287
01:17:56,980 --> 01:17:58,230
Oh look, Tanya ma'am is here!

1288
01:17:58,310 --> 01:17:59,270
Let's ask her.

1289
01:17:59,650 --> 01:18:00,400
Ma'am,

1290
01:18:00,850 --> 01:18:02,440
have you watched the movie 'Queen'?

1291
01:18:02,650 --> 01:18:03,230
Yes

1292
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:04,730
Isn't she the real hero?

1293
01:18:05,310 --> 01:18:05,730
Hey,

1294
01:18:05,810 --> 01:18:06,940
she's the heroine!

1295
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:11,350
We shouldn't be living
silently in this society

1296
01:18:11,560 --> 01:18:12,890
Let your husband get here

1297
01:18:12,940 --> 01:18:15,560
I'll ask him how could he
possibly leave you alone like this

1298
01:18:15,730 --> 01:18:18,520
and roam around for his meetings!

1299
01:18:18,810 --> 01:18:21,890
If business is so important,
he should've just married his work!

1300
01:18:22,020 --> 01:18:23,020
Isn't it?

1301
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:24,900
Ok, let me go freshen up

1302
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:31,600
You just have no grip
over your tongue, right?

1303
01:18:31,810 --> 01:18:32,480
Sir, I didn't mean it....

1304
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:33,690
Idiot!

1305
01:18:34,810 --> 01:18:35,600
Pedro,

1306
01:18:36,020 --> 01:18:37,310
what did I say wrong?

1307
01:18:37,480 --> 01:18:38,690
Serves you right!

1308
01:18:39,270 --> 01:18:40,810
Actually, you deserved more!

1309
01:18:40,980 --> 01:18:44,350
The other day when Kutty and I were
discussing the coffee and sugar episode

1310
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:45,940
how much you yelled at me

1311
01:18:46,730 --> 01:18:48,440
How is it even related to
what just happened?

1312
01:18:49,770 --> 01:18:50,730
Oh god!

1313
01:18:51,190 --> 01:18:53,890
Why are you so blind to the things
happening in front of you?

1314
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:14,480
(A popular Kannada song )

1315
01:19:22,550 --> 01:19:24,390
You're such a bad player!

1316
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:27,260
You lost your queen

1317
01:19:28,220 --> 01:19:30,800
My queen is on her way out, Kutty

1318
01:19:31,140 --> 01:19:33,640
and I can't do anything about it

1319
01:19:33,850 --> 01:19:35,930
Had he been like you and
gone on that he is helpless

1320
01:19:35,970 --> 01:19:38,260
you think NRI Ismail Bhai would've
been a big janitor in Dubai?

1321
01:19:38,260 --> 01:19:39,590
[RJ]..Welcome to our programme 'Love Guru'

1322
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:45,510
[RJ]..You've just listened to a song
from the film 'Padavaralli Pandavaru'

1323
01:19:45,800 --> 01:19:48,260
Checkmate!
[RJ]..we have the next caller on line

1324
01:19:48,850 --> 01:19:50,220
[RJ]..Who is this?

1325
01:19:50,260 --> 01:19:52,050
[Ramesh]..Hello, I'm Ramesh

1326
01:19:52,140 --> 01:19:53,510
[RJ]..So tell me Ramesh

1327
01:19:53,510 --> 01:19:54,510
Let's play another game?
[RJ]..where are you speaking from?

1328
01:19:54,600 --> 01:19:56,800
[Ramesh]..Until now I was speaking from my mouth

1329
01:19:56,890 --> 01:19:59,720
[Ramesh]..But today, I have called to speak
straight from my heart

1330
01:19:59,850 --> 01:20:04,470
[RJ]..Love Guru is always at the
service of his callers to offer his help

1331
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:06,930
[RJ]..Please tell me, what is your problem?

1332
01:20:07,100 --> 01:20:09,010
[Ramesh]..I'll come straight to the point

1333
01:20:09,140 --> 01:20:11,340
[Ramesh]..I am madly in love with a girl

1334
01:20:11,470 --> 01:20:13,890
[Ramesh]..But I'm unable to tell her my feelings

1335
01:20:13,970 --> 01:20:15,890
[Ramesh]..One suggests e-mailing her

1336
01:20:15,930 --> 01:20:18,090
[Ramesh]..the other suggests
texting her on WhatsApp

1337
01:20:18,350 --> 01:20:20,300
[Ramesh]..I feel helpless.
What shall I do?

1338
01:20:20,470 --> 01:20:21,930
[Ramesh]..Please help me

1339
01:20:22,260 --> 01:20:25,300
[RJ voice]..Do you really love her?

1340
01:20:25,510 --> 01:20:26,550
[Ramesh]..Yes

1341
01:20:26,680 --> 01:20:28,300
[RJ]..Does she know you?

1342
01:20:28,470 --> 01:20:29,350
[Ramesh]..Yes, of course!

1343
01:20:29,430 --> 01:20:30,930
[Ramesh]..She is my owner's daughter

1344
01:20:31,010 --> 01:20:32,590
[RJ]..Does she speak to you?

1345
01:20:32,640 --> 01:20:34,640
[Ramesh]..She came this morning

1346
01:20:34,640 --> 01:20:37,640
[Ramesh]..Ranted with me
for half an hour for not paying the electricity bill

1347
01:20:37,680 --> 01:20:41,890
[Ramesh]..But what does she know,
I bought her gift with the same money!

1348
01:20:41,930 --> 01:20:45,220
[RJ]..So you guys talk, but your love story is
not moving forward, isn't it?

1349
01:20:45,260 --> 01:20:46,300
[Ramesh]..Exactly!

1350
01:20:46,300 --> 01:20:48,760
[RJ]..Do you have a pen and paper with you?

1351
01:20:48,930 --> 01:20:51,510
[Ramesh]..I do. Wait a minute

1352
01:20:52,050 --> 01:20:53,090
[RJ]..Dear friends

1353
01:20:53,220 --> 01:21:00,010
[RJ]..Let's see what an important part
a love letter Plays in Ramesh's after this Ad

1354
01:21:00,300 --> 01:21:03,300
[RJ]..Let's take a break

1355
01:21:05,470 --> 01:21:06,720
My foot Nirma

1356
01:21:08,390 --> 01:21:10,510
a spoilsport this ad played
during this crucial point!

1357
01:21:12,430 --> 01:21:13,720
What are you guys upto?

1358
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:16,260
Writing a love letter, sir!

1359
01:21:16,930 --> 01:21:17,510
Sir

1360
01:21:17,550 --> 01:21:18,680
not a love letter

1361
01:21:18,760 --> 01:21:19,930
Just a letter

1362
01:21:20,050 --> 01:21:21,300
A letter?

1363
01:21:21,390 --> 01:21:22,340
Hmmmm

1364
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:25,050
Earlier, even I used to write letters

1365
01:21:25,180 --> 01:21:28,260
But now who has the time to
write or read them?

1366
01:21:30,430 --> 01:21:33,890
[RJ]..Welcome back to 'Love Guru' episode

1367
01:21:34,100 --> 01:21:39,220
[RJ]..Come let's listen to what
Ramesh writes in his love letter

1368
01:21:39,510 --> 01:21:41,470
[RJ]..Mr Ramesh, are you ready?

1369
01:21:41,550 --> 01:21:42,550
[Ramesh]..Ready Love Guru!

1370
01:21:42,680 --> 01:21:45,180
Please don't go by Tarun sir's words
[RJ]..Mr Ramesh, what's her name?

1371
01:21:45,220 --> 01:21:47,680
He has not been able to woo any girl!
[Ramesh]...Mallika

1372
01:21:47,680 --> 01:21:49,890
Concentrate on the show
[RJ]..Are you ready to pour feelings of your heart onto the paper?

1373
01:21:49,970 --> 01:21:51,100
[Ramesh]..Yes Love Guru!

1374
01:21:51,100 --> 01:21:52,720
[RJ]..Dear Mallika!

1375
01:21:52,760 --> 01:21:55,050
[RJ]..I will be wherever you are

1376
01:21:55,180 --> 01:21:56,340
[RJ]..Are you following the words?

1377
01:21:57,720 --> 01:22:00,970
[RJ]..I will be with you forever as your eyes,
as your voice.

1378
01:22:00,970 --> 01:22:06,220
[RJ]..I will stay as the shade
you need in a heated summer

1379
01:22:06,510 --> 01:22:08,260
[RJ]..When I had the
lovely company of yours by my side

1380
01:22:08,640 --> 01:22:12,510
[RJ]..I didn't notice it and now
I'm suffering all day craving for your love

1381
01:23:11,970 --> 01:23:13,300
Why did you stop playing?

1382
01:23:14,510 --> 01:23:17,390
And you have a new audience today!

1383
01:23:18,430 --> 01:23:20,390
I was trying a new tune

1384
01:23:21,350 --> 01:23:24,140
And I wasn't sure if the audience
would turn up!

1385
01:23:26,260 --> 01:23:27,640
I got your message

1386
01:23:28,430 --> 01:23:30,180
But I would've turned up even without it!

1387
01:23:31,180 --> 01:23:33,470
Poor Swarna,
how will she know of my situation?

1388
01:23:33,970 --> 01:23:35,800
She didn't do it intentionally

1389
01:23:36,010 --> 01:23:36,890
It's not that

1390
01:23:37,430 --> 01:23:40,300
Sometimes you have to do all that
for the audience to turn up!

1391
01:24:01,510 --> 01:24:02,890
What happened?

1392
01:24:03,260 --> 01:24:05,390
Did you stop to say sorry again?

1393
01:24:06,850 --> 01:24:08,640
It's strange, you know

1394
01:24:09,680 --> 01:24:11,760
Every time I play,

1395
01:24:12,640 --> 01:24:14,260
my audience

1396
01:24:15,550 --> 01:24:17,010
start dancing!

1397
01:24:17,930 --> 01:24:19,680
But my new audience...

1398
01:24:19,890 --> 01:24:21,300
they're so quiet

1399
01:24:21,550 --> 01:24:23,300
It's a bit boring you know

1400
01:24:25,050 --> 01:24:26,090
Dance!!

1401
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:30,850
Once upon a time I knew a dancer,

1402
01:24:31,140 --> 01:24:33,260
She would dance as soon as music picks up

1403
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:39,220
Now she's fond of sitting by the beach
and listening to songs!

1404
01:24:39,220 --> 01:24:40,260
That's it!

1405
01:24:41,930 --> 01:24:43,050
You know what?

1406
01:24:44,010 --> 01:24:46,470
You better meet her once in a while

1407
01:24:47,640 --> 01:24:48,590
Who knows,

1408
01:24:48,890 --> 01:24:50,720
she may be missing you...

1409
01:24:51,100 --> 01:24:52,050
Or

1410
01:24:52,350 --> 01:24:54,640
you could be possibly missing her!

1411
01:24:56,970 --> 01:24:58,100
Alright!

1412
01:24:58,510 --> 01:24:59,220
Ok

1413
01:25:00,050 --> 01:25:01,590
Let's say hi to her

1414
01:25:01,930 --> 01:25:03,050
But mind you

1415
01:25:03,470 --> 01:25:07,220
as far as I know,
she isn't such a great dancer

1416
01:25:07,850 --> 01:25:09,220
I'm warning you!

1417
01:25:14,550 --> 01:25:19,760
It’s a saga of the earth and the sky

1418
01:25:20,600 --> 01:25:25,680
Sailing on a sea of emotions

1419
01:25:26,470 --> 01:25:31,640
The gentle breeze sings a lullaby

1420
01:25:32,550 --> 01:25:37,760
And the twin stars playing a symphony

1421
01:25:38,600 --> 01:25:49,140
A bridge of beautiful emotions
has now blossomed between us

1422
01:25:50,600 --> 01:25:55,800
It’s a saga of the earth and the sky

1423
01:25:56,640 --> 01:26:01,720
Sailing on a sea of emotions

1424
01:26:25,850 --> 01:26:31,470
It seems as though the waves are here
to fathom the depths of the heart

1425
01:26:31,890 --> 01:26:36,930
So shall I embrace this new feeling...?

1426
01:26:37,890 --> 01:26:43,510
This gypsy heart of mine is now
fostering a whole new dream

1427
01:26:43,930 --> 01:26:48,970
but it is yet to be acknowledged

1428
01:26:49,850 --> 01:27:02,600
A new phase life of is teasing and beckoning me
from across the seas

1429
01:27:21,800 --> 01:27:24,260
Out here, my life

1430
01:27:24,970 --> 01:27:27,470
feels like an adventure

1431
01:27:29,430 --> 01:27:32,090
You are aware that my husband is no more

1432
01:27:33,430 --> 01:27:39,050
But at the resort, everyone thinks that
my husband will soon arrive from Dubai

1433
01:27:40,550 --> 01:27:42,260
Uncle and aunty think

1434
01:27:43,300 --> 01:27:46,800
I'm a guest and am single

1435
01:27:49,470 --> 01:27:50,720
One girl...

1436
01:27:51,510 --> 01:27:52,840
Three stories...

1437
01:27:54,600 --> 01:27:56,640
What's true and what's not

1438
01:27:57,550 --> 01:27:59,590
Everything is a matter of perspective

1439
01:28:01,970 --> 01:28:03,850
But life is like that, no?

1440
01:28:04,720 --> 01:28:07,470
Everybody has his/her own opinion about us

1441
01:28:08,140 --> 01:28:09,760
The funny part is

1442
01:28:10,600 --> 01:28:13,100
sometimes we ourselves will
not know who the real us is

1443
01:28:20,100 --> 01:28:21,760
What plans tomorrow?

1444
01:28:23,140 --> 01:28:24,640
A lot of shopping to do

1445
01:28:25,180 --> 01:28:27,090
Uncle and aunty's anniversary...

1446
01:28:27,100 --> 01:28:27,930
Hey look! Shooting star

1447
01:28:27,930 --> 01:28:29,300
Where?
Quick! Wish for something!

1448
01:28:29,350 --> 01:28:30,140
Not fair

1449
01:28:30,180 --> 01:28:31,090
Call it back

1450
01:28:31,640 --> 01:28:33,510
Just one wish is too tough.

1451
01:28:34,600 --> 01:28:36,470
You're late. It disappeared

1452
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:38,800
Hey look, there's another one!

1453
01:28:38,930 --> 01:28:39,640
Liar!

1454
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:46,300
What will you wish for
if you spot a shooting star?

1455
01:28:48,930 --> 01:28:49,640
Maybe

1456
01:28:52,050 --> 01:28:55,510
I'll ask it to bring back my old life

1457
01:28:58,100 --> 01:28:58,800
And you?

1458
01:29:02,430 --> 01:29:05,390
I'll ask it to give me a new life

1459
01:29:27,510 --> 01:29:29,590
Please wake up early at least today

1460
01:29:29,800 --> 01:29:32,720
You had promised to make
me breakfast today

1461
01:29:33,010 --> 01:29:34,300
I hope you remember that

1462
01:29:37,180 --> 01:29:38,090
What to do?

1463
01:29:38,300 --> 01:29:40,050
One doesn't even feel like
shouting at you...

1464
01:29:43,300 --> 01:29:44,760
But if I keep quiet

1465
01:29:44,850 --> 01:29:47,300
you only get more mischievous!

1466
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:50,590
Even though it's been 30 years
since we got married

1467
01:29:50,720 --> 01:29:53,640
I'm yet to figure you out!

1468
01:29:57,390 --> 01:29:58,970
Happy anniversary!

1469
01:30:00,390 --> 01:30:02,510
Looks like I'll have to
ready the breakfast even today

1470
01:30:03,010 --> 01:30:04,590
Anniversary special!

1471
01:30:41,640 --> 01:30:42,720
Happy anniversary!

1472
01:30:42,760 --> 01:30:43,930
Thank you!

1473
01:30:43,970 --> 01:30:45,470
Take a seat

1474
01:30:45,720 --> 01:30:46,890
Weren't you asleep?

1475
01:30:46,970 --> 01:30:48,050
Of course, I was

1476
01:30:48,220 --> 01:30:49,640
Your kiss

1477
01:30:49,890 --> 01:30:51,470
the cute wish...

1478
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:53,050
I didn't realise you did any of that!

1479
01:30:54,930 --> 01:30:55,510
Look

1480
01:30:56,010 --> 01:30:57,760
I've made this breakfast

1481
01:30:58,100 --> 01:31:01,050
Let me know how you like it

1482
01:31:01,260 --> 01:31:02,640
Every day when I make breakfast

1483
01:31:02,760 --> 01:31:04,800
you have complaints that
it lacks salt or spice

1484
01:31:05,050 --> 01:31:06,760
It's my turn to do that

1485
01:31:07,550 --> 01:31:11,550
To be frank, your cooking always lacks
salt, sweet and spice

1486
01:31:11,680 --> 01:31:13,140
But don't I eat it?

1487
01:31:13,260 --> 01:31:14,840
Will I do that intentionally?

1488
01:31:14,970 --> 01:31:16,850
It's as per the doctor's order
that I'm doing so

1489
01:31:18,800 --> 01:31:20,010
Did Tarun call?

1490
01:31:20,260 --> 01:31:22,300
No. But he never forgets to wish us

1491
01:31:22,390 --> 01:31:23,800
Wonder why he hasn't called?

1492
01:31:23,890 --> 01:31:25,180
You think he's with Tanya?

1493
01:31:27,220 --> 01:31:28,800
What do you think of her?

1494
01:31:30,220 --> 01:31:32,300
You have doubts about me even at this age?

1495
01:31:32,390 --> 01:31:33,430
Not that...

1496
01:31:33,640 --> 01:31:35,550
I'm talking about Tarun and Tanya

1497
01:31:35,890 --> 01:31:36,720
What do you think of them?

1498
01:31:36,930 --> 01:31:37,840
They make a good pair, right?

1499
01:31:56,180 --> 01:31:57,430
Is Tarun here, yet?

1500
01:31:59,300 --> 01:32:00,890
Not yet, ma'am

1501
01:32:02,430 --> 01:32:03,300
What's this?

1502
01:32:03,390 --> 01:32:05,680
You've spelt 'Happy' wrong!

1503
01:32:06,350 --> 01:32:10,140
Ma'am one has to be happy first to
spell it correctly, right?

1504
01:32:11,350 --> 01:32:12,430
Why, what happened?

1505
01:32:12,550 --> 01:32:13,640
What to do ma'am?

1506
01:32:13,800 --> 01:32:15,300
I'm just an ordinary driver here

1507
01:32:16,010 --> 01:32:18,260
And they have absolutely no respect for me

1508
01:32:18,640 --> 01:32:21,680
But had I been in Dubai and earning well?

1509
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:23,470
Then Swar...

1510
01:32:25,720 --> 01:32:27,180
Girls are like that madam

1511
01:32:27,720 --> 01:32:29,300
They all want boys from Dubai

1512
01:32:29,470 --> 01:32:30,850
Why do you feel that way?

1513
01:32:31,140 --> 01:32:32,430
Look at Tarun sir

1514
01:32:32,600 --> 01:32:34,390
He was in a good job in America

1515
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:35,300
But now

1516
01:32:35,470 --> 01:32:38,510
he's quit that life and is struggling here

1517
01:32:41,970 --> 01:32:42,430
Hi

1518
01:32:42,470 --> 01:32:43,300
Ready?

1519
01:32:43,930 --> 01:32:45,010
Sorry I am late

1520
01:32:45,050 --> 01:32:45,840
No problem

1521
01:32:47,220 --> 01:32:47,640
Hey!

1522
01:32:48,010 --> 01:32:49,890
What's this? You've spelt Happy wrong!

1523
01:32:50,390 --> 01:32:53,220
One has to be happy first to
spell it correctly, right?

1524
01:32:53,600 --> 01:32:55,350
What happened? You're out of brandy?

1525
01:32:56,550 --> 01:32:57,220
Ok

1526
01:32:57,510 --> 01:33:00,340
Give this receipt to Swarna
and ask her to file it

1527
01:33:00,970 --> 01:33:01,760
Come, let's go

1528
01:33:12,720 --> 01:33:13,430
Is it ready?

1529
01:33:13,430 --> 01:33:14,180
It's ready

1530
01:33:14,260 --> 01:33:16,050
Give me 5 minutes to pack it

1531
01:33:31,350 --> 01:33:32,010
Tarun

1532
01:33:32,720 --> 01:33:35,260
you love get pictures framed, right?

1533
01:33:35,350 --> 01:33:36,470
Yes, why?

1534
01:33:37,970 --> 01:33:38,970
Just asked that's all

1535
01:33:40,970 --> 01:33:42,680
But now everything is digital

1536
01:33:42,850 --> 01:33:44,760
Nobody bothers with getting
pictures printed

1537
01:33:46,430 --> 01:33:47,640
Don't know why

1538
01:33:47,890 --> 01:33:49,470
but digital has never impressed me

1539
01:33:50,260 --> 01:33:51,390
It's not even real

1540
01:33:51,600 --> 01:33:55,970
Books, music and photos,
I like physical copies of them all

1541
01:33:56,430 --> 01:33:59,010
I like to feel them in my hands

1542
01:34:01,720 --> 01:34:03,390
Just try holding a photograph

1543
01:34:04,890 --> 01:34:07,890
A story on all the goings on of that
day will run through your mind

1544
01:34:08,180 --> 01:34:10,140
Some would've occurred in real

1545
01:34:10,640 --> 01:34:12,800
others will be your imagination

1546
01:34:14,300 --> 01:34:17,220
Photos represent
a beautiful moment of our life

1547
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:20,470
If you frame it, it'll be saved for posterity

1548
01:34:21,260 --> 01:34:25,930
And whenever you look at it,
you can savour those beautiful moments

1549
01:34:26,640 --> 01:34:29,930
If it's digital, then it will stay in your memory card
in some corner of your house

1550
01:34:30,720 --> 01:34:32,180
And not in front of you!

1551
01:34:35,050 --> 01:34:35,840
Sir, ready

1552
01:34:36,050 --> 01:34:36,840
Coming!

1553
01:34:40,430 --> 01:34:41,390
Thank you!

1554
01:34:42,970 --> 01:34:43,470
Tanya

1555
01:34:45,100 --> 01:34:45,930
let's go?

1556
01:34:46,010 --> 01:34:46,550
Yeah,

1557
01:34:46,600 --> 01:34:47,850
just give me a moment...

1558
01:34:48,850 --> 01:34:50,260
Where's the restroom?

1559
01:34:51,800 --> 01:34:52,840
She means toilet!

1560
01:34:53,470 --> 01:34:54,350
It's behind here

1561
01:35:06,550 --> 01:35:08,180
How long did you live in the US?

1562
01:35:09,890 --> 01:35:11,010
About five or six years

1563
01:35:11,760 --> 01:35:15,010
But when I look back today,
I sometimes doubt if I ever lived there!

1564
01:35:17,050 --> 01:35:18,090
But who told you?

1565
01:35:18,300 --> 01:35:18,640
Ped..

1566
01:35:19,550 --> 01:35:20,720
let's leave that aside

1567
01:35:21,050 --> 01:35:22,890
What job were you pursuing?

1568
01:35:23,430 --> 01:35:25,720
I was working as a Business Analyst

1569
01:35:26,470 --> 01:35:28,470
Good job. Good pay

1570
01:35:28,760 --> 01:35:32,050
Travelling business class. Staying in exotic hotels

1571
01:35:33,220 --> 01:35:35,140
I had everything one would want in life

1572
01:35:35,930 --> 01:35:37,800
Good life, no?

1573
01:35:38,800 --> 01:35:40,970
Initially, even I felt the same

1574
01:35:41,260 --> 01:35:42,220
Then what happened?

1575
01:35:42,350 --> 01:35:43,930
Any problem raised?

1576
01:35:44,010 --> 01:35:45,970
I wondered what next.
That became the problem

1577
01:35:46,260 --> 01:35:47,300
What do you mean?

1578
01:35:48,680 --> 01:35:50,300
Every day the same routine

1579
01:35:50,890 --> 01:35:52,590
I felt like a robot

1580
01:35:53,300 --> 01:35:55,680
I was feeling as if I was programmed

1581
01:35:56,550 --> 01:35:58,390
So I felt the intense urge to run away from it all

1582
01:35:58,760 --> 01:35:59,550
Then?

1583
01:35:59,800 --> 01:36:00,840
I came away!

1584
01:36:01,100 --> 01:36:02,100
What?

1585
01:36:05,550 --> 01:36:09,430
Did you come alone or did you have company?

1586
01:36:10,390 --> 01:36:12,930
I wanted to come here with someone, but....

1587
01:36:13,550 --> 01:36:14,430
But??

1588
01:36:16,050 --> 01:36:18,430
She was looking at a future with me there,

1589
01:36:18,970 --> 01:36:21,430
I was looking a future for us here

1590
01:36:22,890 --> 01:36:26,050
Then I thought why should I
spoil her future and came alone

1591
01:36:26,390 --> 01:36:28,340
I returned and opened the resort here

1592
01:36:28,640 --> 01:36:30,470
Everything was going well...

1593
01:36:31,390 --> 01:36:33,470
except the butter chicken!

1594
01:36:50,100 --> 01:36:51,470
Oh sorry!

1595
01:36:56,100 --> 01:36:56,890
What's this?

1596
01:36:58,640 --> 01:36:59,390
For me?

1597
01:36:59,390 --> 01:37:00,010
Yes

1598
01:37:00,010 --> 01:37:01,140
Seriously?

1599
01:37:02,350 --> 01:37:04,800
I wanted to give it to you
on the day you were leaving...

1600
01:37:05,140 --> 01:37:06,140
Why?

1601
01:37:06,850 --> 01:37:09,260
Anyway, now that there's no surprise left

1602
01:37:09,850 --> 01:37:11,220
open it

1603
01:37:12,180 --> 01:37:13,220
Thank you!

1604
01:37:23,430 --> 01:37:24,800
Just in case

1605
01:37:25,140 --> 01:37:28,340
you chance upon a
beautiful moment in our resort

1606
01:37:29,430 --> 01:37:31,930
and feel like capturing it...

1607
01:37:38,700 --> 01:37:40,200
You're hopeless man...

1608
01:37:40,650 --> 01:37:41,690
Why?

1609
01:37:42,150 --> 01:37:43,650
Had I been in your place

1610
01:37:43,780 --> 01:37:44,940
not only would I have been
married to Swarna

1611
01:37:45,030 --> 01:37:47,240
but would've had two kids by the name
Raghavendra and Murali by now!

1612
01:37:47,700 --> 01:37:49,320
Raghavendra and Murali?

1613
01:37:49,610 --> 01:37:50,740
Why?

1614
01:37:51,110 --> 01:37:52,440
Those are the names of my grandfathers

1615
01:37:52,490 --> 01:37:53,320
If I have kids

1616
01:37:53,570 --> 01:37:54,780
I plan on naming them after my grandfathers

1617
01:37:54,820 --> 01:37:55,360
Haha!

1618
01:37:57,450 --> 01:37:58,650
What if you have daughters?

1619
01:38:01,450 --> 01:38:03,820
What’s important? Deciding my daughters
names or giving Swarna the letter

1620
01:38:04,240 --> 01:38:05,610
The letter is more important

1621
01:38:06,030 --> 01:38:07,150
Then listen carefully

1622
01:38:08,070 --> 01:38:10,900
There's pulao cooking in the cooker

1623
01:38:11,990 --> 01:38:14,990
give her the letter by the time
pulao is cooked

1624
01:38:15,530 --> 01:38:16,610
The rest for later

1625
01:38:16,780 --> 01:38:17,440
Ok

1626
01:38:31,700 --> 01:38:32,610
I know very well

1627
01:38:33,070 --> 01:38:34,450
that you won't give her the letter

1628
01:38:35,280 --> 01:38:37,030
I'll give it to her Kutty,
please shut up now

1629
01:38:37,280 --> 01:38:38,530
I'll definitely give it!

1630
01:38:38,990 --> 01:38:41,650
If you wanted to give it, why did you
leave it in the kitchen?

1631
01:38:44,450 --> 01:38:45,200
What's this?

1632
01:38:45,990 --> 01:38:46,990
Have you written her another letter?

1633
01:38:47,820 --> 01:38:48,610
Oh god

1634
01:38:48,700 --> 01:38:50,200
that's a receipt!

1635
01:38:51,150 --> 01:38:53,490
The one Tarun sir asked me to
give Swarna for filing

1636
01:38:56,240 --> 01:38:57,070
Kutty

1637
01:38:57,990 --> 01:39:00,320
I don't think a letter is necessary

1638
01:39:01,990 --> 01:39:04,030
I'll only go and
confess my feelings to her!

1639
01:39:04,400 --> 01:39:05,240
Look at her

1640
01:39:05,570 --> 01:39:07,240
so engrossed in the computer

1641
01:39:07,820 --> 01:39:09,780
As soon as she’s done chatting,
I’ll go tell her everything

1642
01:39:10,070 --> 01:39:10,860
Promise!

1643
01:39:12,030 --> 01:39:13,400
Don't give me all this bulls&*t.

1644
01:39:14,530 --> 01:39:15,740
Go give her the letter

1645
01:39:16,860 --> 01:39:17,440
Ok

1646
01:39:18,530 --> 01:39:20,400
The pulao is nearly cooked, now off you go!

1647
01:39:20,780 --> 01:39:22,320
No Kutty!

1648
01:39:22,860 --> 01:39:23,690
Go, give!

1649
01:39:24,360 --> 01:39:25,150
Go, give!

1650
01:39:25,240 --> 01:39:25,860
Give!

1651
01:39:26,610 --> 01:39:27,530
Give it....

1652
01:39:33,070 --> 01:39:33,700
Kutty, no!

1653
01:39:33,820 --> 01:39:35,240
She can see us

1654
01:39:35,490 --> 01:39:37,440
The pulao is done. Now go fast!

1655
01:39:39,820 --> 01:39:41,780
She is busy on that computer Kutty

1656
01:39:42,320 --> 01:39:44,240
Let her finish it. I promise to give it

1657
01:39:44,360 --> 01:39:46,900
I don't think her chat session
will be done soon

1658
01:39:47,490 --> 01:39:49,900
And you are too scared to
give her the letter

1659
01:39:50,530 --> 01:39:52,150
Looks like I only have to do something

1660
01:39:54,740 --> 01:39:56,570
Anyway you're coming in six months...

1661
01:40:00,990 --> 01:40:01,940
Damn!

1662
01:40:10,070 --> 01:40:10,950
Swarna....

1663
01:40:11,530 --> 01:40:12,110
What is it?

1664
01:40:12,110 --> 01:40:13,690
That..is..

1665
01:40:13,950 --> 01:40:15,320
What is it Pedro?

1666
01:40:19,450 --> 01:40:21,360
Tarun Sir has asked you to file this receipt

1667
01:40:22,280 --> 01:40:25,650
I had to do all this drama for him
to hand over that silly receipt!

1668
01:40:26,070 --> 01:40:27,070
Bloody hell!

1669
01:40:29,990 --> 01:40:31,530
To hell with him! And this letter!

1670
01:40:36,200 --> 01:40:37,070
Uncle, careful...

1671
01:40:37,150 --> 01:40:37,990
watch out!

1672
01:40:38,860 --> 01:40:41,490
You blindfold me and say watch out!

1673
01:40:42,280 --> 01:40:44,860
Uncle, it's nice
if there are surprises in life, no?

1674
01:40:44,900 --> 01:40:45,690
Ok, ok

1675
01:40:45,700 --> 01:40:47,070
Surprises it is!

1676
01:40:47,150 --> 01:40:47,820
Radha?

1677
01:40:47,860 --> 01:40:48,940
Uncle! It's me, Tanya!

1678
01:40:50,650 --> 01:40:53,400
Sorry, I mistook you for Radha

1679
01:40:53,650 --> 01:40:54,530
Yeah right!

1680
01:40:54,570 --> 01:40:56,740
You're always waiting for an opportunity
to flirt with someone!

1681
01:40:57,150 --> 01:40:58,320
Yeah, yeah...

1682
01:40:59,320 --> 01:41:00,070
Ok, are we there yet?

1683
01:41:00,200 --> 01:41:00,780
3,

1684
01:41:01,530 --> 01:41:02,110
2,

1685
01:41:02,700 --> 01:41:03,360
1...

1686
01:41:03,610 --> 01:41:05,240
Surprise!

1687
01:41:05,700 --> 01:41:06,820
Mr. Murthy

1688
01:41:07,280 --> 01:41:09,780
You always wanted to go to Hawaii, right?

1689
01:41:09,860 --> 01:41:12,070
See, now I have brought the Hawaii here!

1690
01:41:15,280 --> 01:41:15,940
Swarna!

1691
01:41:16,070 --> 01:41:17,030
ALOHA!

1692
01:41:18,610 --> 01:41:19,400
ALOHA!

1693
01:41:19,400 --> 01:41:20,820
Thank you!

1694
01:41:24,280 --> 01:41:25,530
Welcome drinks!

1695
01:41:25,610 --> 01:41:27,360
You're here, too!

1696
01:41:27,490 --> 01:41:30,240
How can there be a party without me!

1697
01:41:31,450 --> 01:41:32,700
Here, take it!

1698
01:41:32,990 --> 01:41:33,740
No, no not this.

1699
01:41:33,740 --> 01:41:34,820
This one!

1700
01:41:35,650 --> 01:41:37,740
The one that is marked is for you, sir!

1701
01:41:48,820 --> 01:41:50,150
Stop, stop...

1702
01:41:50,610 --> 01:41:51,690
let's all click a picture.

1703
01:41:51,950 --> 01:41:52,700
Smile please!

1704
01:42:10,110 --> 01:42:11,490
Hey Shahid!

1705
01:42:11,570 --> 01:42:13,280
When is your son returning from Dubai?

1706
01:42:13,280 --> 01:42:14,820
Next month

1707
01:42:16,320 --> 01:42:18,320
Must be returning with pots of money then!

1708
01:42:19,030 --> 01:42:20,190
Rajeev!

1709
01:42:20,490 --> 01:42:23,740
What's this?
You look like a goldmine yourself!

1710
01:42:24,200 --> 01:42:25,610
It's His blessings!

1711
01:42:25,740 --> 01:42:28,690
God's blessings or Taneja's blessings?

1712
01:42:33,280 --> 01:42:33,740
Hello

1713
01:42:33,820 --> 01:42:34,740
One more, on the rocks!

1714
01:42:34,860 --> 01:42:35,860
Kutty

1715
01:42:36,570 --> 01:42:38,820
have you ever had a drink 'on the rocks'?

1716
01:42:39,110 --> 01:42:40,190
Of course! Many times!

1717
01:42:40,320 --> 01:42:41,950
It's common at our place

1718
01:42:42,150 --> 01:42:44,190
Whenever our NRI Ismail Bhai is in town

1719
01:42:44,280 --> 01:42:45,650
He gets foreign brands

1720
01:42:45,700 --> 01:42:47,610
and we down it, sitting on the rocks!

1721
01:42:47,700 --> 01:42:49,030
That's how we drink! On the rocks!

1722
01:43:26,490 --> 01:43:28,360
Can I have your attention, please?

1723
01:43:36,110 --> 01:43:37,360
Ok

1724
01:43:38,400 --> 01:43:40,530
In the 'Prabhava' calendar

1725
01:43:42,030 --> 01:43:43,650
and in 'Abhijit' auspicious period

1726
01:43:44,650 --> 01:43:48,490
Having tied the knot with the
blessings of the elders

1727
01:43:48,570 --> 01:43:50,030
my uncle Murthy

1728
01:43:50,860 --> 01:43:52,650
and my aunt Radha....

1729
01:43:53,360 --> 01:43:59,610
are today successfully completing
30 years of married life and...

1730
01:44:00,200 --> 01:44:01,950
yeah, they're celebrating this occasion!

1731
01:44:01,950 --> 01:44:05,740
And even though it's been this long,
Murthy uncle

1732
01:44:05,950 --> 01:44:09,150
still likes to sit on the beach
and look at....

1733
01:44:09,530 --> 01:44:10,570
Tarun!

1734
01:44:11,280 --> 01:44:13,280
Enough of talking about me

1735
01:44:13,820 --> 01:44:15,110
Speak something about your aunty, too!

1736
01:44:15,490 --> 01:44:18,320
She has tolerated me for 30 years!

1737
01:44:18,740 --> 01:44:20,030
Ok, let's move on

1738
01:44:22,530 --> 01:44:25,070
Ok, talking about Radha aunty

1739
01:44:25,570 --> 01:44:29,110
no one can guess that she's been
married for 30 years!

1740
01:44:30,360 --> 01:44:32,190
The same charm

1741
01:44:32,570 --> 01:44:33,990
the same smile even today

1742
01:44:34,860 --> 01:44:36,860
How do you manage to do all this?

1743
01:44:37,530 --> 01:44:40,490
You have to come up here and
give us tips. Come

1744
01:44:40,530 --> 01:44:41,610
No Tarun

1745
01:44:41,900 --> 01:44:44,570
Your uncle has the same complaint
for the past 30 years

1746
01:44:45,030 --> 01:44:47,190
that I don't let him speak

1747
01:44:47,610 --> 01:44:49,610
And if he speaks,
I apparently don't listen to him

1748
01:44:50,030 --> 01:44:50,530
So

1749
01:44:50,820 --> 01:44:51,360
Murthy

1750
01:44:51,570 --> 01:44:53,780
today you talk and I'll listen

1751
01:44:54,240 --> 01:44:54,820
Fine

1752
01:44:59,490 --> 01:45:00,400
Radha

1753
01:45:01,740 --> 01:45:05,860
I became speechless the moment I saw you!

1754
01:45:08,280 --> 01:45:10,280
But today, I'll speak

1755
01:45:10,450 --> 01:45:11,280
ok?

1756
01:45:12,110 --> 01:45:15,240
Thank you!

1757
01:45:17,110 --> 01:45:18,530
All of you,

1758
01:45:19,320 --> 01:45:20,860
just look up for a moment

1759
01:45:22,820 --> 01:45:25,110
Apparently, there's someone up there

1760
01:45:25,570 --> 01:45:27,570
I was told

1761
01:45:27,990 --> 01:45:31,440
Apparently, he created a man first

1762
01:45:31,900 --> 01:45:33,740
after which he gave the man a riddle

1763
01:45:33,990 --> 01:45:36,820
He told him, I've created a girl
just for you

1764
01:45:37,110 --> 01:45:39,740
so go search for her

1765
01:45:40,650 --> 01:45:44,280
Many folks went off to solve this riddle

1766
01:45:44,450 --> 01:45:46,150
and lost themselves in the process

1767
01:45:46,530 --> 01:45:47,400
But

1768
01:45:47,740 --> 01:45:50,900
I never found that need to solve the riddle

1769
01:45:51,280 --> 01:45:52,490
I was born

1770
01:45:53,320 --> 01:45:56,110
and the path which I had to
tread on made itself known to me

1771
01:45:56,990 --> 01:45:58,740
When I opened my eyes,

1772
01:45:59,320 --> 01:46:05,200
my girl Radha was standing there
waiting for me

1773
01:46:05,820 --> 01:46:06,820
Thank you Radha

1774
01:46:07,360 --> 01:46:08,610
for being my soul mate

1775
01:46:12,400 --> 01:46:13,400
Listen here,

1776
01:46:13,990 --> 01:46:16,690
just in case you want to thank me,

1777
01:46:17,110 --> 01:46:18,530
don't do that just yet

1778
01:46:19,610 --> 01:46:22,360
Say thanks to the boy who is
standing here beside me

1779
01:46:24,030 --> 01:46:25,320
It's because of him

1780
01:46:25,450 --> 01:46:26,610
that you are alive

1781
01:46:27,110 --> 01:46:28,440
if not,

1782
01:46:29,320 --> 01:46:31,780
my wife here would've cursed you
every day...

1783
01:46:32,280 --> 01:46:34,070
that we don't have kids

1784
01:46:35,860 --> 01:46:36,690
What did you say?

1785
01:46:39,570 --> 01:46:40,320
Tarun

1786
01:46:41,280 --> 01:46:42,610
He's saying thanks!

1787
01:46:43,780 --> 01:46:44,610
Thank you!

1788
01:46:50,990 --> 01:46:52,030
Hey,

1789
01:46:52,950 --> 01:46:54,570
let's have some music!

1790
01:48:15,610 --> 01:48:16,400
Thank you Tarun.

1791
01:48:16,400 --> 01:48:17,400
Thanks a lot!

1792
01:48:18,200 --> 01:48:19,490
Awesome party

1793
01:48:20,740 --> 01:48:21,530
Thank you Tanya,

1794
01:48:21,610 --> 01:48:22,570
Thank you so much

1795
01:48:22,570 --> 01:48:24,990
No aunty, I should thank you

1796
01:48:25,240 --> 01:48:28,030
I had planned on staying here
alone for four days

1797
01:48:28,200 --> 01:48:29,950
But when I leave back tomorrow

1798
01:48:30,110 --> 01:48:31,740
I'm going to feel terribly lonely

1799
01:48:31,820 --> 01:48:32,860
Please don't say that

1800
01:48:33,110 --> 01:48:35,650
You can come here any time
you want and meet us

1801
01:48:35,820 --> 01:48:36,570
Thank you

1802
01:48:36,740 --> 01:48:37,570
Radha,

1803
01:48:37,820 --> 01:48:41,360
don't worry. She'll be back here soon

1804
01:48:41,650 --> 01:48:43,650
I know that for sure

1805
01:48:43,900 --> 01:48:44,820
Come, come

1806
01:48:45,860 --> 01:48:46,940
Bye both of you

1807
01:48:46,950 --> 01:48:47,700
Bye

1808
01:48:48,240 --> 01:48:50,320
Take care Tarun. Bye

1809
01:48:50,490 --> 01:48:51,280
Bye

1810
01:48:51,820 --> 01:48:52,610
Pedro,

1811
01:48:53,610 --> 01:48:55,070
I hope you're not drunk

1812
01:48:55,610 --> 01:48:58,030
Yes boy, careful

1813
01:48:58,150 --> 01:49:00,070
I have an aged wife here!

1814
01:49:00,240 --> 01:49:01,110
Yeah right!

1815
01:49:01,360 --> 01:49:02,030
Swarna

1816
01:49:02,450 --> 01:49:04,110
I had told you about the surprise,

1817
01:49:04,240 --> 01:49:04,940
please don't forget it!

1818
01:49:05,110 --> 01:49:05,650
Sure sir.

1819
01:49:07,570 --> 01:49:08,280
Sit properly Murthy!

1820
01:49:08,900 --> 01:49:09,440
Bye Tarun!

1821
01:49:10,360 --> 01:49:15,940
Somewhere over the rainbow,

1822
01:49:16,150 --> 01:49:18,940
bluebirds

1823
01:49:20,360 --> 01:49:21,400
Pedro

1824
01:49:21,780 --> 01:49:23,820
please don’t turn behind

1825
01:49:23,860 --> 01:49:26,900
I'm romancing my wife here

1826
01:49:27,280 --> 01:49:28,990
Can't you just stay quiet for a while?

1827
01:49:29,950 --> 01:49:32,110
Did I get married to you to sit quietly?

1828
01:49:33,780 --> 01:49:36,570
when i spotted the cross mark on the
tender coconut

1829
01:49:36,740 --> 01:49:38,690
I knew something was up

1830
01:49:39,280 --> 01:49:40,360
I was right! God help me!

1831
01:49:41,150 --> 01:49:44,320
Stop, stop, Pedro!

1832
01:49:44,450 --> 01:49:46,320
Why uncle? You want to puke?

1833
01:49:46,900 --> 01:49:48,030
No, no

1834
01:49:48,650 --> 01:49:49,780
The weather is so fabulous

1835
01:49:49,780 --> 01:49:53,320
I want to walk home
holding hands with Radha!

1836
01:49:53,530 --> 01:49:54,820
Are you crazy?

1837
01:49:55,200 --> 01:49:55,900
Uncle,

1838
01:49:55,900 --> 01:49:57,360
you're in not in a condition to walk

1839
01:49:57,610 --> 01:49:59,400
Let me drop you home now. Come

1840
01:49:59,530 --> 01:50:00,240
God

1841
01:50:00,360 --> 01:50:02,240
you're such a rookie!

1842
01:50:02,360 --> 01:50:06,860
You still have a lot to learn about romance
and that such a shame!

1843
01:50:07,200 --> 01:50:09,820
Stop. Stop. Stop

1844
01:50:10,490 --> 01:50:11,940
Right here.

1845
01:50:24,070 --> 01:50:24,860
Pedro,

1846
01:50:24,950 --> 01:50:25,860
Bye

1847
01:50:25,900 --> 01:50:26,690
Bye, uncle!

1848
01:50:26,990 --> 01:50:27,900
Swarna,

1849
01:50:28,320 --> 01:50:31,950
This boy is a little slow. Beware!

1850
01:50:32,030 --> 01:50:33,990
Ok, that's enough. You're too much!

1851
01:50:34,780 --> 01:50:36,110
Pedro, you make a move.

1852
01:50:36,200 --> 01:50:37,030
I'll take him home

1853
01:50:38,360 --> 01:50:40,690
Not just take me home.
Hold my hand and take me home

1854
01:50:40,780 --> 01:50:42,030
I'm holding your hand, come

1855
01:50:42,320 --> 01:50:42,820
Bye

1856
01:50:42,860 --> 01:50:43,610
Bye aunty

1857
01:50:51,950 --> 01:50:53,900
When you watch them together,

1858
01:50:54,490 --> 01:50:57,360
you start believing in love

1859
01:50:58,530 --> 01:51:00,860
I don't know what love looks like

1860
01:51:01,740 --> 01:51:04,820
but if it looks like this, it's nice

1861
01:51:07,320 --> 01:51:08,820
I'm talking rubbish now!

1862
01:51:09,150 --> 01:51:10,110
No Swarna

1863
01:51:10,360 --> 01:51:12,070
You're speaking sense!

1864
01:51:33,360 --> 01:51:34,280
What's all this Pedro?

1865
01:51:34,280 --> 01:51:35,570
Sshh!

1866
01:51:37,570 --> 01:51:39,860
When I came to you last noon,

1867
01:51:40,200 --> 01:51:42,400
it wasn't to give you
the receipt for filing

1868
01:51:42,700 --> 01:51:44,700
I wanted to talk to you

1869
01:51:45,610 --> 01:51:47,280
But what do I do Swarna?

1870
01:51:47,490 --> 01:51:51,190
When you start shouting,
I get tensed

1871
01:51:51,740 --> 01:51:53,150
Is that my mistake?

1872
01:51:54,400 --> 01:51:56,940
I know that you've been
dreaming about going to Dubai

1873
01:51:57,490 --> 01:51:59,740
I guess shortly you'll even get married
and move there

1874
01:52:01,240 --> 01:52:04,490
I too can stay mum and
not share my feelings with you

1875
01:52:05,280 --> 01:52:06,190
But

1876
01:52:06,360 --> 01:52:12,440
damn Pedro, you should have
just confessed your feelings to Swarna..

1877
01:52:13,320 --> 01:52:15,240
I don't want to make that mistake,

1878
01:52:15,240 --> 01:52:17,240
which is why I've gathered all my guts

1879
01:52:17,700 --> 01:52:19,530
and got this to confess my feelings to you

1880
01:52:20,490 --> 01:52:21,690
Swarna

1881
01:52:22,240 --> 01:52:23,740
I don't know if I'm right or wrong

1882
01:52:24,450 --> 01:52:26,490
Nor do I know if you'll accept my proposal
or reject it

1883
01:52:30,320 --> 01:52:31,530
I love you

1884
01:52:31,990 --> 01:52:33,610
from inside

1885
01:52:34,400 --> 01:52:36,110
Will you please marry me?

1886
01:52:36,200 --> 01:52:37,200
Are you done?

1887
01:52:38,070 --> 01:52:39,030
Can we leave?

1888
01:52:40,610 --> 01:52:42,360
You didn't even respond...

1889
01:52:44,030 --> 01:52:46,570
It'll take us 10 minutes to get home

1890
01:52:47,740 --> 01:52:49,190
Let me think about it then and tell you

1891
01:52:49,530 --> 01:52:50,860
You'll tell me no?

1892
01:53:01,400 --> 01:53:04,280
I have never taken chances in life

1893
01:53:05,820 --> 01:53:07,030
My entire life

1894
01:53:07,320 --> 01:53:08,700
I've had the same career goal

1895
01:53:09,820 --> 01:53:11,530
same set of friends

1896
01:53:12,780 --> 01:53:13,780
and the same man

1897
01:53:15,360 --> 01:53:17,320
I didn't take chances with anything

1898
01:53:19,150 --> 01:53:21,070
But I took the chance and came here

1899
01:53:22,360 --> 01:53:24,280
And I think I made the right choice

1900
01:53:25,490 --> 01:53:28,070
So, it's guaranteed that
we'll get a good review from you!

1901
01:53:30,240 --> 01:53:31,240
But

1902
01:53:31,950 --> 01:53:33,990
once I leave from here tomorrow

1903
01:53:34,860 --> 01:53:37,360
what if the old thoughts
start haunting me again?

1904
01:53:40,490 --> 01:53:43,360
If everything goes as per plan,
then you don't call that life

1905
01:53:44,360 --> 01:53:48,240
Life is a surprise package
in which you never know what to expect!

1906
01:53:50,320 --> 01:53:51,900
But sometimes,

1907
01:53:52,110 --> 01:53:54,190
even happiness scares me

1908
01:53:55,070 --> 01:53:59,400
Because it could be snatched away
from me at any moment!

1909
01:54:05,360 --> 01:54:07,900
Yet, it's very essential to have something
called hope in life

1910
01:54:09,070 --> 01:54:11,820
But you shouldn't hold on to to it tightly

1911
01:54:12,030 --> 01:54:13,650
It's fragile...like glass

1912
01:54:14,280 --> 01:54:18,860
we hold on to it tightly
thinking we might lose it

1913
01:54:19,030 --> 01:54:22,490
But in the process, we end up
hurting ourselves

1914
01:54:23,150 --> 01:54:25,530
It's not like that wound will not heal

1915
01:54:27,070 --> 01:54:28,490
but it takes time

1916
01:54:30,570 --> 01:54:32,110
I really hope so

1917
01:54:32,650 --> 01:54:34,690
I really hope it heals soon

1918
01:54:37,900 --> 01:54:39,030
Anyway,

1919
01:54:40,240 --> 01:54:41,610
good night

1920
01:54:43,400 --> 01:54:45,650
Thank you for the lovely evening

1921
01:54:47,320 --> 01:54:48,700
Good night

1922
01:54:49,280 --> 01:54:50,740
You have to be up at 5 am tomorrow

1923
01:54:50,900 --> 01:54:51,860
please remember that

1924
01:54:51,950 --> 01:54:52,610
Sure,

1925
01:54:52,900 --> 01:54:54,360
I can't wait to see that place!

1926
01:54:58,200 --> 01:54:59,070
Bye

1927
01:55:00,030 --> 01:55:01,070
Bye

1928
01:55:32,570 --> 01:55:32,950
Swarna,

1929
01:55:33,700 --> 01:55:34,950
I'm searching for a job in Dubai.

1930
01:55:35,360 --> 01:55:37,490
Ismail Bhai has promised
to get me a job there.

1931
01:55:38,240 --> 01:55:39,650
I'll go there and become
a successful janitor

1932
01:55:39,780 --> 01:55:40,940
and make lots of money!

1933
01:55:41,320 --> 01:55:42,200
Promise!

1934
01:55:43,200 --> 01:55:43,900
You idiot,

1935
01:55:44,280 --> 01:55:45,820
do you know what a janitor is?

1936
01:55:46,820 --> 01:55:47,990
One who cleans toilets!

1937
01:55:52,200 --> 01:55:52,650
Pedro,

1938
01:55:53,200 --> 01:55:55,450
love alone isn't enough to get married.

1939
01:55:56,740 --> 01:55:57,650
More than love,

1940
01:55:58,360 --> 01:56:00,070
Marriage also calls for
responsibility and commitment.

1941
01:56:01,030 --> 01:56:03,400
And by time you have children
and attend to family responsibilities

1942
01:56:03,950 --> 01:56:05,530
a good 20 years of your life
would've passed

1943
01:56:06,650 --> 01:56:07,360
And by then,

1944
01:56:08,110 --> 01:56:11,150
love is the last thing on your mind.

1945
01:56:12,860 --> 01:56:16,190
Sometimes, love alone
doesn't suffice to lead a life

1946
01:56:18,150 --> 01:56:19,490
And yes, one more thing.

1947
01:56:20,490 --> 01:56:21,820
My name is not Mallika.

1948
01:56:35,110 --> 01:56:36,240
Swarna

1949
01:56:37,280 --> 01:56:39,110
20 years later

1950
01:56:39,490 --> 01:56:41,190
you'll have all of this in your life

1951
01:56:41,400 --> 01:56:43,110
Except love

1952
01:56:44,610 --> 01:56:47,360
What will you do if you remember
this moment, then?

1953
01:56:49,950 --> 01:56:58,610
Your memories
have taken over the depths of my being

1954
01:56:58,820 --> 01:57:05,360
So please bear with me oh dear heart

1955
01:57:07,200 --> 01:57:13,820
Having lost myself in a sea of emotions

1956
01:57:15,610 --> 01:57:21,440
The romantic in me seeks to be steeped in love

1957
01:57:49,070 --> 01:57:52,490
The heart is pounding fast and loud

1958
01:57:53,240 --> 01:57:56,400
I am not able to contain the singing of my heart

1959
01:57:57,110 --> 01:58:02,650
Making me so uneasy yet so cosy

1960
01:58:05,240 --> 01:58:12,190
Memories that I have gathered, have brought me to a halt

1961
01:58:13,150 --> 01:58:19,190
Urging me to walk along with it, hand in hand..

1962
01:58:20,150 --> 01:58:25,610
Memories that I have gathered, have brought me to a halt

1963
02:00:38,400 --> 02:00:39,490
Ma'am

1964
02:00:39,570 --> 02:00:40,400
Please go to your room immediately

1965
02:00:40,400 --> 02:00:41,860
There's a surprise for you!

1966
02:00:46,320 --> 02:00:46,740
Sir

1967
02:00:46,740 --> 02:00:50,740
there's bigger surprise awaiting her than what you have planned!

1968
02:00:57,110 --> 02:00:57,780
Akash??

1969
02:00:58,150 --> 02:00:59,610
What are you doing here?

1970
02:00:59,650 --> 02:01:00,240
Tanya..

1971
02:01:00,610 --> 02:01:01,440
Please!

1972
02:01:01,860 --> 02:01:04,320
I don't want to talk to
people who're dead

1973
02:01:04,490 --> 02:01:06,900
And you are dead to
me a long time ago!

1974
02:01:07,240 --> 02:01:08,280
Tanya, give me a chance!

1975
02:01:08,280 --> 02:01:09,240
Chance?

1976
02:01:10,030 --> 02:01:13,570
The first time you cheated on me,
I should’ve dumped you

1977
02:01:13,780 --> 02:01:15,030
But I gave you a chance

1978
02:01:15,200 --> 02:01:16,610
That was my mistake!

1979
02:01:16,700 --> 02:01:18,530
Now you want me to give you
another chance??

1980
02:01:18,780 --> 02:01:20,070
Tanya, that was a mistake

1981
02:01:20,200 --> 02:01:22,200
I was drunk that night

1982
02:01:22,530 --> 02:01:24,530
Let me explain

1983
02:01:24,950 --> 02:01:27,740
That's all that girls need to do right?

1984
02:01:27,950 --> 02:01:30,740
When you guys have some explaining to do,
we must lend our ears!

1985
02:01:31,030 --> 02:01:32,900
When you cheat us and

1986
02:01:33,030 --> 02:01:35,070
run behind another woman

1987
02:01:35,400 --> 02:01:37,610
it becomes our duty to bring you
back on the right path!

1988
02:01:38,740 --> 02:01:40,610
In this whole scenario of
setting your life right

1989
02:01:40,780 --> 02:01:44,320
have you ever wondered what
happens to my life?

1990
02:01:45,990 --> 02:01:47,190
Akash

1991
02:01:47,570 --> 02:01:50,110
In this whole exercise of trying
to keep your dream intact

1992
02:01:50,110 --> 02:01:52,740
my dreams kept crumbling Akash!

1993
02:01:55,950 --> 02:01:56,820
Tanya

1994
02:01:57,320 --> 02:02:00,150
I don't understand any word you're saying!

1995
02:02:02,150 --> 02:02:03,150
Akash

1996
02:02:03,820 --> 02:02:05,200
all these years

1997
02:02:05,240 --> 02:02:07,440
even while I spoke in your language

1998
02:02:08,030 --> 02:02:10,860
you never tried to understand me

1999
02:02:11,650 --> 02:02:14,990
I did everything for you Akash

2000
02:02:15,400 --> 02:02:17,110
Everything and more

2001
02:02:18,400 --> 02:02:23,240
In this whole rigmarole of not losing you,
I ended up losing myself

2002
02:02:25,030 --> 02:02:28,690
You never truly wanted me, right?

2003
02:02:30,610 --> 02:02:34,490
What you actually wanted was
my concern for you

2004
02:02:34,700 --> 02:02:36,530
And the control you had over me

2005
02:02:36,570 --> 02:02:37,610
That’s it!

2006
02:02:38,700 --> 02:02:39,530
Tanya, listen to me

2007
02:02:39,530 --> 02:02:40,860
Don't touch me Akash!

2008
02:02:41,530 --> 02:02:43,900
Get out of here. It's sickening!

2009
02:02:45,070 --> 02:02:48,200
I told you that was a mistake!

2010
02:02:48,900 --> 02:02:49,400
Please..

2011
02:02:49,400 --> 02:02:50,240
No,

2012
02:02:50,650 --> 02:02:52,320
That wasn't the mistake

2013
02:02:52,530 --> 02:02:54,780
I'll say what the mistake was!

2014
02:02:55,900 --> 02:03:00,610
Every time you cheated on me,
I kept forgiving you, right?

2015
02:03:00,900 --> 02:03:02,110
That was the mistake!

2016
02:03:02,360 --> 02:03:03,860
Having forgiven you

2017
02:03:04,150 --> 02:03:06,610
I agreed to marry you, right?

2018
02:03:06,610 --> 02:03:08,610
That was the bigger mistake!

2019
02:03:12,860 --> 02:03:13,740
Akash

2020
02:03:13,860 --> 02:03:17,400
You were the centre of my universe

2021
02:03:18,900 --> 02:03:21,490
I always stood by you

2022
02:03:21,740 --> 02:03:22,860
Always

2023
02:03:23,950 --> 02:03:26,320
I kept thinking everything will be all right

2024
02:03:26,490 --> 02:03:28,320
But you didn't change a bit!

2025
02:03:30,030 --> 02:03:34,030
We had just one week to
go for the wedding

2026
02:03:35,240 --> 02:03:37,940
Anjali was my best friend Akash!

2027
02:03:38,200 --> 02:03:39,820
And you went ahead and....

2028
02:03:41,610 --> 02:03:43,690
Just leave Akash,

2029
02:03:44,320 --> 02:03:48,070
Just don’t let me make the
mistake of forgiving you again!

2030
02:03:48,490 --> 02:03:49,860
Just go away!

2031
02:03:52,200 --> 02:03:53,110
Tanya

2032
02:03:54,200 --> 02:03:56,450
I mostly don't understand what you're saying

2033
02:03:56,490 --> 02:03:58,740
but I told you I was not in my senses!

2034
02:03:59,320 --> 02:04:01,110
I was drunk that night!

2035
02:04:01,610 --> 02:04:04,150
I've come all the way to apologize!

2036
02:04:04,990 --> 02:04:07,030
I really want you back in my life...

2037
02:04:07,110 --> 02:04:09,490
I do want you back in my life...

2038
02:04:09,860 --> 02:04:13,360
please please forgive me please...

2039
02:04:34,860 --> 02:04:38,610
I'm.. trying to pretend,

2040
02:04:38,900 --> 02:04:41,110
I don't care

2041
02:04:41,490 --> 02:04:43,990
Trying to accept,

2042
02:04:44,200 --> 02:04:46,490
this is fair

2043
02:04:46,780 --> 02:04:49,240
Love ain't easy,

2044
02:04:49,400 --> 02:04:51,610
life is hard

2045
02:04:51,860 --> 02:04:54,400
Is this the end,

2046
02:04:54,570 --> 02:04:57,450
or this the start

2047
02:04:59,490 --> 02:05:02,070
Of something new!

2048
02:05:02,490 --> 02:05:04,650
I'm.. trying to believe,

2049
02:05:05,030 --> 02:05:06,940
we are through

2050
02:05:07,740 --> 02:05:12,860
So.. lift the shadow of the doubt,

2051
02:05:13,150 --> 02:05:15,280
You let me in,

2052
02:05:15,570 --> 02:05:18,200
now let me out!

2053
02:05:38,820 --> 02:05:45,320
I'm.. trying to pretend, I won't miss you

2054
02:05:45,490 --> 02:05:47,860
May be it's too late

2055
02:05:48,150 --> 02:05:50,360
or too soon

2056
02:05:50,490 --> 02:05:52,860
To wonder with,

2057
02:05:53,150 --> 02:05:55,860
To wonder why

2058
02:05:56,200 --> 02:06:03,700
May be this.. is not goodbye

2059
02:07:21,280 --> 02:07:23,110
Swarna, is Tanya there?

2060
02:07:23,240 --> 02:07:25,400
No, She left already

2061
02:07:25,610 --> 02:07:26,490
And then there's...

2062
02:07:59,070 --> 02:08:02,570
No parking here, hello!

2063
02:08:05,530 --> 02:08:06,740
Hello mister!

2064
02:08:06,740 --> 02:08:08,530
Can’t you hear me?

2065
02:11:38,400 --> 02:11:46,610
In the distance echoes the hum
Of a bird in pursuit of a nest

2066
02:11:47,530 --> 02:11:54,570
The silver skies are now filled
with the warm glow of daylight

2067
02:11:56,610 --> 02:12:03,650
The evening sky is adorned with intoxicating colours

2068
02:12:05,780 --> 02:12:13,280
The jubilant mind is consumed by the desire for love

2069
02:12:14,650 --> 02:12:23,440
Shall I lose myself on this new journey...

2070
02:12:23,820 --> 02:12:32,400
And it seems like the green earth and the azure skies are in agreement
