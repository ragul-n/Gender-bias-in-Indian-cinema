00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:33,000
*Let's dance*

3
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:41,000
*Let's set off
a storm together*

4
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
*Dance with me and steal
some color from the world*

5
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
*Get colorful*

6
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
*Get colorful*

7
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:03,000
*Let's dance*

8
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:11,000
*Let's set off
a storm together*

9
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
*Dance with me and steal
some color from the world*

10
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
*Get colorful*

11
00:03:19,000 --> 00:04:07,000
*So very colorful*

12
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:15,000
*There are so many faces...
mine ought to be recognized*

13
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:24,000
*There are so many big names...
may mine be mentioned too*

14
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
*Life would be great*

15
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
*The days would be mine,
so would the nights*

16
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
*And a joyous tune played
all the time...*

17
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:45,000
*Dance away*

18
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:53,000
*Let's kick up a
storm together*

19
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
*Dance with me; let's steal
some color from the world*

20
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
*Get colorful*

21
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:27,000
*Get colorful*

22
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
*Come to me, friends;
drive away my problem*

23
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:40,000
*The goodies fight among themselves;
I'm the sweeter one, they all say*

24
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
*They take me for a kid!*

25
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:49,000
*There's so much
of tension around*

26
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
*What would a man do...*

27
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
*who doesn't know how to
live it up in the world*

28
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
*They look for their
destiny in the parrots...*

29
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
*in the stars up above...*

30
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
*they hunt for their fortune...
but can't tell what it is*

31
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
*Should one believe
in oneself...*

32
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
*all obstacles would be
easy to overcome*

33
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
*And the world would
be in our hands*

34
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:27,000
*Dance away*

35
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:35,000
*Let's kick up a storm together*

36
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
*Let's steal some color
from the world*

37
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
*Get colorful*

38
00:06:43,000 --> 00:07:24,000
*Get colorful*

39
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
What's up?

40
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
You've ruined my dream!

41
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
What a dream!

42
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I was dancing and singing
and swaying away...

43
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,000
and the world was
swaying with me.

44
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I'm not going to
forgive you for this!

45
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Oh indeed. As if...
- Where's my file?

46
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
It's there on the table!

47
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
And where is the table?

48
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Under that heap of files.
- Found it!

49
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
*Enjoy yourself, O drunkard...*

50
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Not you too!
- Well?

51
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Who else has been bothering my wife?
- Look at the princess's airs!

52
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,000
She's late for work. And she says
I've ruined her dream!

53
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
That's not right, Mili.

54
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
She ruined your dream
while you slept.

55
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
And she ruined my dreams
while I still live!

56
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Have I ever complained?
- As if you'd be a big shot!

57
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Listen, darling...
- Yes?

58
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I had always dreamed, that:
*I'd never be a somebody*

59
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
*What have we to be...?*

60
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Aren't you going for your bath?
*- Why must we bathe...?*

61
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
What are you doing...?
Have you gone mad?

62
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Stop it!

63
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,000
You must be happy that your daughter
even dreams of what she wants to be.

64
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
All right. But dreams are fulfilled
only when man rises from his slumber.

65
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:16,000
But you dream only when you
go to sleep, understand?

66
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
What is it?

67
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
What are you doing?
- I'm studying.

68
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Are you really studying?
Or are you asleep?

69
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
He's studying... he isn't dreaming.

70
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Here I go...

71
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
My word, Motilal! You've taken to
your books so early in the day!

72
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I don't intend to spend 3 years
in Class 10 like you.

73
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
My little brother...

74
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I wasn't killing time in Class 10.
I was learning to dance.

75
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Because I'm not going to be
a clerk after those studies.

76
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I want to become an actress.

77
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Sister...
- Well?

78
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Could you give me an autograph?

79
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
How about a kick...?
Will that do?

80
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Mili! Aren't you leaving?
- I'll fix you, all right.

81
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
The camera isn't rolling.

82
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Whether the camera's
rolling or not...

83
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I'm a director whose mind
is always at work.

84
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I'm not competing with
the directors here.

85
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I'm competing with Hollywood.
So let me see the frame.

86
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
It's so very dark...
I can't see anything.

87
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Dark...? It must be
because of this cap.

88
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:05,000
As I said, "Hum Aapke Hain Koun"
is said to be a hit movie.

89
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
It has broken all records.

90
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
All that is okay. But do you
know the inside story?

91
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,000
No, I don't.

92
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
It was my script.
- Yours?!

93
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I was supposed to produce
the film originally.

94
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
And all those sequences are
actually part of my marriage!

95
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Really?
- But I said it's okay...

96
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Suraj is my own boy.
Let him direct the film.

97
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
And everyone praises the film today.

98
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
It's Suraj who is walking
away with all the credit...

99
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
but it was my story, after all!

100
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Gulbadan hasn't yet
reported for shooting.

101
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
It's a 9 'O clock shift.
And she isn't here at 12!

102
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
She's going to make
beggars out of my kids!

103
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I don't think I will
ever see this film.

104
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Don't stand there and grin.
Go and call her!

105
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Here she is...
so very punctual!

106
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Welcome, madam.

107
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Get a chair for mummy!

108
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Set it here.
- Of course, madam.

109
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Do you know the story before
the song sequence?

110
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
My baby doesn't know anything.

111
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Our heroine is in the village.
Out there, the cold breeze...

112
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Would you like a cold drink, dear?
- Sure.

113
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Could you send for
some fruit juice?

114
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Get a glass of fruit-juice.
- Two glasses.

115
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:51,000
As I said, there's a cool breeze
blowing in the village...

116
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I'd like a milk shake
with custard apple... okay?

117
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
A milk shake with custard apple.
- Make it two.

118
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Yes. Go on.
- With lots of ice.

119
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
This isn't a season for custard apple.
- Get it from somewhere!

120
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
It's available only in November.
- So get it in November!

121
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I've been explaining a sequence!

122
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:20,000
You're screaming!
You have scared my little girl!

123
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Send for the fan...
- Get the fan!

124
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Is this dress okay?

125
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Let's shoot the song first.
I'll narrate the story later.

126
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
The shot is ready.

127
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Tickets worth 10 going
for 30...

128
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Want one?

129
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Tickets worth 10
going for 30...

130
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:05,000
How much?
- 30 Rupees.

131
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Two tickets for me.
- So cough it up.

132
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
What?
- 60 bucks.

133
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,000
They're corner seats, I hope?
- Of course. At opposite ends.

134
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Give me some tickets, Munna.
Mine are finished.

135
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
How are you doing?
- Great.

136
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I come on foot and hail
a cab to go back home.

137
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Tickets for 10 Rupees
going for 30...

138
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Do you have any tickets?
- Want an advance booking?

139
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
You're kidding.
How much is it going for?

140
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Didn't you hear that?
For 30 Rupees.

141
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Could I have it for 15 Rupees?
- You get to watch half the film.

142
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Oh damn it...
- Come back here.

143
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I like your face.
Go and watch the film.

144
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Tickets for 10 Rupees
going for 30...

145
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Come here.
- What is it?

146
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Come here!
- Me...?

147
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
You've been selling tickets
in the black-market?

148
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Me? Do I look like
a black-marketer?

149
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,000
What was that about 30 Rupees then?
- I was looking for tickets myself.

150
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I'd happily pay 30 bucks for a ticket.
But there's no one around.

151
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Do you think I'm a fool?
Raise your hand!

152
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Stop kidding sir...
how'd I raise my hand at you?

153
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Raise your hands... go on!
- Hey! You're bullying me!

154
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Look at this, folks!

155
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
They let those who instigate
riots, go scot-free.

156
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
There was a scandal involving
billions in the stock market.

157
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Did they arrest anyone?
No.

158
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
But they will harass a poor guy
like me who wants to watch a film.

159
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Go ahead...

160
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Did you find something?
No?

161
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
You have humiliated me
publicly, haven't you?

162
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
What's going to happen
to this country...?

163
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Get lost, fellows!
This ain't no drama!

164
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
What sleight of hand!

165
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Hey black egg... get lost.
- Scram!

166
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Where's the rest of the gang?
- They've left.

167
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Let's make ourselves scarce...
things are heating up here.

168
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
What happened?

169
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,000
What kind of a director are you
to make her do such a dance?

170
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Aren't you ashamed to give her
such difficult steps?

171
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
This director is a fool!

172
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
He watches MTv and gets us
to do weird steps...

173
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Does anyone ask an actress
to do such difficult steps?

174
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:51,000
What if something had
happened to my girl?

175
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Don't get excited, mummy.
I'll handle it...

176
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Does it hurt?
- Don't worry...

177
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I'll have the steps changed.
- Like hell you will!

178
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
You should've known better than
ask her to do such steps!

179
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
You aren't hurt badly...
- Shut up! How isn't it bad?

180
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
What do you know?

181
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
You don't become a director
by merely wearing a viewfinder.

182
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
The poor baby has
sprained her ankle...

183
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
It's pack-up for the day...
Pack up!

184
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Hear me out, mummy, please...!
- Didn't you hear me? Pack up!

185
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Come, dear... let's go.

186
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Please, mummy!
I'll have it changed!

187
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I can't figure out of if we have
signed the girl or her mother!

188
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Why do the girls' mothers
ever attend a shoot?!

189
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I'm going to quit this place and
head straight for Hollywood!

190
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,000
What the hell! I'll go bust,
if you go to Hollywood!

191
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I don't care what happens to you!
That old hag...

192
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Calm down, please. I'll somehow make
them see reason and bring them...

193
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Why are you getting worked up?

194
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Sorry, Kamalji.
It's pack up.

195
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Would Julia Roberts' mother ever treat
Spielberg like I've been treated?

196
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Kamalji's leaving.
- What else will he do?

197
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
He's such a fine actor.

198
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
But the lady always finds
some excuse to throw a fuss.

199
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I think she's just not
interested in her work.

200
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Why must we bother?
We're getting paid.

201
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
How can you say such things?

202
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,000
We come here so we can learn
something and become good actors.

203
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
It isn't that we just
come here, dance and leave.

204
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Sorry, lady. I have no ambitions.
I'm happy where I am.

205
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Go ahead if you want
to make it big.

206
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:46,000
How're you doing?
- Fine.

207
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Switch on that fan.

208
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Get us some tea.
Quick.

209
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Read that sign. You pay cash.

210
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
If I had the money, wouldn't
I go to a five-star?

211
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I'll settle your account tomorrow.
- Sure?

212
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Of course. Whom else have I paid?

213
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Go on. And get me
some cookies.

214
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Did you get those tickets, Munna?

215
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
What're you screaming for?
- Mili! Come here!

216
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Why are you screaming?
- Sit down. Have a soft drink.

217
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
No. I'm going home.

218
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Sit for a while. I'll join you.
Get a cold drink for her.

219
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Prakash! You're smoking again?
- I'm kicking the habit tomorrow.

220
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
So... how's the shoot going?

221
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Don't even ask me.

222
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
The lead-lady made us work so
hard on a simple step today...

223
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
that we had it coming out
of our ears.

224
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I've been telling you
to give it up.

225
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
You're going to wear out
your shoes in those shoots.

226
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
You start lecturing me now...?
- It's true.

227
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I've seen life there on the footpaths.
- Try and think of something better.

228
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
You're wasting your time
like a worthless loafer.

229
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Find some job in a nice company.
- To hell with jobs!

230
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Rather than play a rich man's dog,
I'll enjoy my life out on the streets.

231
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I'll be my own boss...
Right, Pakya?

232
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Right!

233
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:55,000
You're never going to change.
- Where are you going, Mili!

234
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:01,000
*Listen to what I have
to say, guys...*

235
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:08,000
*Lead your life like I do*

236
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
*It's okay if I don't
own cars and bungalows*

237
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
*It's okay if I don't
have a bank balance*

238
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
*It's okay if I don't own
Tv's and videos*

239
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
*It's okay if I can't
flaunt fancy clothes*

240
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,000
*What must I worry
about all that?*

241
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
*I'll lead a carefree life*

242
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:34,000
*Listen to what I have
to say, friends*

243
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:41,000
*Lead your lives
the way I do*

244
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
*lt'd be great to own
cars and bungalows*

245
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
*With a bank balance to color
your days and nights*

246
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
*Tv's and videos would
be the icing on the cake...*

247
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
*to dress up well
would add to your status*

248
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
*value the good things in life*

249
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
*Mend your ways a bit*

250
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:08,000
*Listen to the philosophy
I follow, friends*

251
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:47,000
*And spend your lives
the way I do*

252
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
*Look at me...*

253
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,000
*I'm a prince who
acts on his whims*

254
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,000
*Wait for the world
to call you a prince...*

255
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
*Don't call yourself
a prince*

256
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
*The name is Munna...*

257
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
*I do just what pleases me*

258
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
*Why should I worry
about how business is*

259
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,000
*Why must I ever keep track
of people coming and going*

260
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
*You're ignorant about
the ways of the world...*

261
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,000
*in such a world
you will never make it*

262
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:27,000
*Listen to this philosophy, friends*

263
00:23:27,000 --> 00:24:00,000
*Lead your lives
as I do*

264
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,000
*Who knows about tomorrow*

265
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
*I live for today*

266
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
*Only those without
any confidence...*

267
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,000
*talk the way you do*

268
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
*Don't you ever say such a thing*

269
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
*They think I'm really tough*

270
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
*The heart of a lion I possess*

271
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,000
*No matter what,
I hold my head high*

272
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
*I wish you could see
beyond your nose*

273
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,000
*But you know nothing*

274
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:40,000
*Listen to me, guys*

275
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:46,000
*Lead your lives
like I do*

276
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,000
*It's be great own
cars and bungalows*

277
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
*Oh to have a bank balance that
would color your days and nights*

278
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
*Tv's and videos would
be such fun*

279
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,000
*Dressing well would
add to your status*

280
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
*Why must I worry
about all that?*

281
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,000
*I'd rather lead a carefree life*

282
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:13,000
*So listen to me, friends...*

283
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:22,000
*Lead your lives
the way I do*

284
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Kamal was fed up of the
lady's tantrums and left...

285
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,000
What ice cream will you eat?
Vanilla, raspberry, pineapple...?

286
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
I don't want an ice cream.
- I'm buying it for you.

287
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Have some.
- I don't want it. Let's go.

288
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Strange! I'm treating you to some
Ice cream, and you don't want it!

289
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:44,000
So what am I to do?

290
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
I didn't like that, Mili.
- What?

291
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
I felt like buying you an ice cream.
And you refused it!

292
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Oh come on, Munna. You take
offense for every little thing.

293
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
I didn't want an ice-cream
and so I refused it.

294
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
I only asked you to have an ice cream!
- There you go again...

295
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Did I say something wrong?
- What's right and what's wrong...?

296
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
You start a fight everywhere...
- What are you doing?

297
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
One banana. What loss is it to you?
- Pay up quietly!

298
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
What will you do if I don't?
Want a bloody punch?

299
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
One moment... how much is it?
- You're not going to pay, Mili!

300
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Will you take it away for free?
- You're asking for it!

301
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
I've already paid you, so keep quiet.
...c'mon, Munna... c'mon!

302
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:21,000
You don't know me, punk!
I'm famous around here!

303
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Mess with me and you'd never be
able to sell bananas here again!

304
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
What the hell was that, Munna?
- You shouldn't have paid him!

305
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Won't he ask you for money
when you pick up a banana?

306
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
It's not about money!
Can't I pay him?

307
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
But you didn't pay him.
- He acted as if I'd stolen a fortune!

308
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:39,000
It was you who started it, Munna.
- But he started the fight!

309
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:44,000
All right! You're not at fault.
Nor is he. I'm the one to blame!

310
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:51,000
So why fight with me
if it was your mistake?

311
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,000
What are you doing all alone, Motilal?
- Mili won't play with me.

312
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Not she... go ahead and bat.
I'll bowl an over.

313
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Mom!
- Here I am.

314
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Munna's going to drive me mad someday.
- Why? Did he get into a fight today?

315
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
It wasn't just a fight.
It was a scene!

316
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:18,000
What happened?
- We were walking together...

317
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,000
and there was this banana-seller.
Munna picked up a banana.

318
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
know what Munna said when the
poor man asked for his money?

319
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,000
What?
- "What loss will one banana make?"

320
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,000
You're laughing! And I know what I've
been through out there on the streets.

321
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Munna is mischievous, I know.
But he's good-hearted.

322
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Most orphans go berserk
without their parents.

323
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
But not him. He's a nice boy.
- Nice, my foot!

324
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Where the hell is it?

325
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,000
For a boy as little as you are,
you play shots like Tendulkar.

326
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
know what?
- What?

327
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Anyone can score sixers
off your bowling.

328
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Really?! Let me see.
Score a sixer...

329
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
You've had it, my boy!
You're going to get a thrashing!

330
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
What's happening out here?

331
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Motilal... who
smashed the pane?

332
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
It was Munna.
- What?

333
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Who was batting?
You? Or me?

334
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
I'm sure Munna's responsible
for all this, Mom.

335
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Is he innocent only because
he's your brother?

336
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Yes, he's my brother...
so what are you going to do?

337
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Quiet, Mili.

338
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Tell me the truth, Motilal.
Who broke the pane?

339
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Munna did.
- You're lying!

340
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Weren't you the one who was batting?
- But you said you'd score a sixer.

341
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
When did I say that?
- You said it, of course!

342
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Will you bully me because
I'm a kid?

343
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:49,000
A kid, eh...?
You're acting smart with me!

344
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:55,000
He's blaming me!
- It's all over, okay?

345
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
The story's over!
- What's over?

346
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Go and take a look at the kitchen.
- So?

347
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Whoever has done it
will clean the mess.

348
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
That's exactly what we don't know.
Who did it?

349
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Munna has done it, I say!
- You're lying again!

350
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Don't you touch me!
- No? I'll give you a slap!

351
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,000
I know you well, fatso.
Go on and clean the mess.

352
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
But...
- No arguments... go on.

353
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Very well...
I'll fix you later.

354
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Go ahead and laugh. You're always
waiting for a chance to laugh at me.

355
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
My sweet will.

356
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
I can laugh at anything
and anyone I wish.

357
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Really...?
- What's this between you now?

358
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
I've had enough of
their fights already.

359
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Come on inside and freshen up.
I'll give you something to eat.

360
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
That's something!

361
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
I'm leaving...
I'm going to the movies.

362
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Which film?
- That Raj Kamal starrer...

363
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Mr. Bond?
- Yes.

364
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
D'you have tickets for the film?
- Sure. I have two tickets.

365
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Wait till I get ready...
- Not you.

366
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,000
I'm going with a friend.
- Won't you take me then?

367
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Why must I take you along?

368
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Please, Munna...
I've been dying to see the film.

369
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Will you poke fun at me again?
- No.

370
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Will you be angry with me?
- Never.

371
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:35,000
All right. Go on and get ready.
I'll change, too.

372
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Kamal! Congratulations!

373
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
This film of yours
is a super hit too!

374
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
There was this distributor
who called from C.P.C.I.

375
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
He said the film would
gross more than 10 million.

376
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,000
The distributor from Delhi
said the same thing.

377
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
The film is bit weak
in Rajasthan, no doubt.

378
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
But it will pick up
by word of mouth.

379
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:10,000
In Bengal and Punjab, it's going
to break all box-office records!

380
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,000
This is what I came to tell you.

381
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Well then, I must leave now.

382
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,000
How about the heroine's call-sheet?
- I've spoken to her mom.

383
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
She said she would
confirm tomorrow.

384
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:33,000
My God! The movie must've begun.
- How are you?

385
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:37,000
C'mon now... we're already late.
The movie must've already begun.

386
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
It's full of songs in
the first half.

387
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Watch the songs on Tv
if you miss them.

388
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
No way. I'm going to
watch the whole film.

389
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Tickets for 10 Rupees
going for 30...

390
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Munna! There's your friend. Pakya.

391
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Tickets for 10 Rupees
going for 30...

392
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
So?

393
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
He's selling tickets
in the black-market!

394
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:02,000
He's had such a black life...
what else will he do?

395
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:07,000
What's that about his black life?
- You'd be shaken up...

396
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
if you get to know the
story of his life.

397
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Pakya's mother died when
he was just 5 years old.

398
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,000
His father, the alcoholic,
kicked the bucket soon after.

399
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Pakya had just one intention in life.
To get his only sister married.

400
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,000
He lived only so his
sister could be married.

401
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,000
But his bad luck. The suitor's parents
asked for so much of dowry...

402
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:34,000
that he has been selling tickets
in the black-market ever since.

403
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Tickets for 10 Rupees
going for 30...

404
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:43,000
No one could know Pakya has
such a sordid story behind him.

405
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,000
The truth about a man is never
obvious from the way he looks.

406
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Let's go.

407
00:32:52,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Show us to our seats, buster...
has the movie started?

408
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:06,000
This cinema hall is a furnace!
Start that fan!

409
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Will you let us
watch the film, please?

410
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Please let us watch the film.
- Stick to your wife, old man.

411
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Enjoying yourself, lady?
- Shut up, Munna!

412
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
You won't even let them
watch the movie in peace!

413
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:23,000
What a great shot!
- I bought it today. Readymade.

414
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
It's him I'm talking about.
Not you.

415
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,000
He wears a hired shirt. I've bought
mine with hard-earned money.

416
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Right?
- Oh yes.

417
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Take that foot off!

418
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Watch the movie... not my foot.
Look ahead.

419
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
I've bought a ticket, too.
- So you own the theater, eh?

420
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
You're showing off
to the girl, are you?

421
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Really? Wait till I fix you...

422
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Get up! What did you say?
- Don't touch me!

423
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:19,000
I won't touch...
I'll kick you!

424
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Hey Mili...

425
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
At least hear me out!

426
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Why aren't you answering me?

427
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,000
I've been calling out to you...
at least answer me.

428
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Get out of my way!

429
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,000
What have I done...?
Why are you so angry?

430
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Don't talk to me, I say!

431
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
What have I done?
- What have you done?

432
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Why did you get into a fight with him?
- Didn't you hear what he said?

433
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,000
I did. And I even saw what you did.
Who asked you to put your foot up?

434
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Great! You find fault only with me!
This isn't right, okay?

435
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,000
I've taken enough, Mili...

436
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Can't you live without
getting into fights?

437
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Now tell me something, uncle.
Why do you go to the movies?

438
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Why do you go to the movies?
For the fun of it, isn't it?

439
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,000
When I pay for my ticket,
won't I even sit comfortably?

440
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Sure you will.
- Then?

441
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:16,000
That doesn't mean you will kick
the man sitting in front of you.

442
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Now don't make up stories!
I haven't kicked anyone!

443
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,000
What's wrong if my foot
happened to touch him?

444
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Nothing wrong at all.
He was having a whale of a time!

445
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
What's happened, Munna?
- Nothing, aunt!

446
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,000
She takes everything to the limit!
So what if I stretched my feet?

447
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Was that guy more interested
in my foot?

448
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Everyone goes to the movies
to enjoy them.

449
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
That doesn't mean you can
kick people around.

450
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Tell me...
isn't that rather cheap?

451
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Isn't it?
- Absolutely.

452
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Talk to me!
I'll answer every accusation!

453
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,000
I don't want to talk to you, I said.
- See?

454
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,000
You decide this, uncle.
She doesn't even listen to me.

455
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,000
And it was such a rotten movie.
It drove me crazy.

456
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Listen... not a word
about the movie, okay?

457
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Why not? Because Raj Kamal,
your favorite, starred in it?

458
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Will a rotten film be good
just because he acts in it?

459
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,000
You're a big shot, aren't you?
- I'm the public!

460
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,000
I have a right to my opinion.

461
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
If I don't get value for my money,
he's finished!

462
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Even your favorite, Raj Kamal.
- Really?

463
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Of course!

464
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,000
My finger...!

465
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Are you hurt...?
What happened?

466
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Let me see...

467
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:48,000
You're always bothering me!

468
00:36:48,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Dad! You're laughing...?

469
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,000
See that?

470
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:27,000
It looks as if the stars
had descended to the earth.

471
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,000
With a house behind every star...

472
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,000
and a story behind
every household.

473
00:37:34,000 --> 00:38:08,000
They all look similar
from a distance.

474
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Munna... what are
you doing here?

475
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:16,000
I've been looking for you.
And you're dancing here all alone.

476
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,000
The lead-lady threw a fuss
and walked out again.

477
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
I thought I'd rehearse
for a while.

478
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
But what brings you here?

479
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:27,000
I created a scene at the
theater yesterday, didn't I?

480
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,000
I went home and thought
about the whole thing.

481
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,000
I felt very sorry.

482
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:38,000
I'm a hot-tempered guy, you know.
I flare up when provoked.

483
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,000
So I've brought two more tickets.

484
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
I'll show you the film today
without anymore fuss.

485
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Oh, get lost.

486
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Is this the set where you shoot?
The place you're so excited about?

487
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:59,000
All that blah blah...
what's go great about it?

488
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,000
We have better decorations during
our festivals in the streets.

489
00:39:02,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Really?

490
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:13,000
*What are you looking for...?
Tell me*

491
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
*Tell me...*

492
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,000
*You can have anything you want*

493
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:25,000
*Such is the magic I work*

494
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:39,000
*You will have
everything you want*

495
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:43,000
*What do you want...?
Tell me*

496
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
*Take it...*

497
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:49,000
*You can have my heart
if you wish*

498
00:40:49,000 --> 00:41:38,000
*What else will I wish for
except your heart...?*

499
00:41:38,000 --> 00:42:08,000
*Take a look at the things
you can see from here*

500
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:15,000
*Everything belongs to you*

501
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:22,000
*What have I to do with
all these things...?*

502
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:33,000
*I belong to you;
you belong to me*

503
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:41,000
*What are you looking for...?
Tell me*

504
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:47,000
*Ask me... how I feel*

505
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:57,000
*Let me have your
heart, darling...*

506
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:04,000
*how about it?*

507
00:43:04,000 --> 00:44:02,000
*Try and understand
what I'm saying*

508
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:09,000
*Come and take look
at the breath-taking view*

509
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:17,000
*Let me introduce you
to the spring*

510
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:24,000
*Forget the views
and the spring...*

511
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:35,000
*Come closer...
my heart beckons you*

512
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:39,000
*What do you want...?
Tell me*

513
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:47,000
*Take anything you wish*

514
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:51,000
*Such is the magic I weave*

515
00:44:51,000 --> 00:46:01,000
*You will have anything
you wish*

516
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,000
I've got to say something to you.
You won't tell anyone, will you?

517
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,000
Of course not. What is it?

518
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:09,000
I haven't spoken about it to anyone.
You're the only one.

519
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,000
No sweat.

520
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Mili...
- What has she done now?

521
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
Have you had another fight?
- Listen to me!

522
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:23,000
You start speaking even before
I've said something.

523
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Mili...

524
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:31,000
her folks likes me a lot.

525
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
They love me so very much.

526
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Her Mom and dad...
they're like family to me.

527
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,000
As for Mili...

528
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:45,000
I like her very much.

529
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,000
You understand what I say?
- Sure.

530
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:58,000
What?
- You like Mili. Her mom and dad too.

531
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:02,000
I... I want to marry Mili.

532
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,000
What? Come again, Munna!

533
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,000
I want to marry Mili.
- Marriage?

534
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Munna's getting married!

535
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Hey... forget it.

536
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,000
I'm serious.
And you're joking.

537
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:22,000
I'm delighted! But why're you
telling me all this?

538
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Go and tell your bride.
I'll only be a guest!

539
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,000
That's the problem.
Mili doesn't take me seriously.

540
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,000
What if I propose to her
and she laughs at me?

541
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Why would she laugh at you?
- You don't know how she is.

542
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:39,000
Forget all that.
You want to marry her, right?

543
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
So you'll have to propose
to her sooner or later.

544
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:45,000
You're right.

545
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Okay, I'll propose to her.
The moment I find an opportunity.

546
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Help!

547
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
She was scared!

548
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,000
You're such a crybaby, Mili.
How're you going to manage?

549
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:12,000
I'm going to scream even louder!
D'you know how scary it is?

550
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:16,000
This is nothing. In America
they have better games.

551
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
America indeed!
As if you've been there!

552
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
He has a railway pass.
He travels there everyday.

553
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:24,000
That's enough. Why do you keep
bothering her, Munna?

554
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
See? And you keep blaming me, mom!
- Enough!

555
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Aren't we going anywhere else?
C'mon...

556
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Where's your daddy?

557
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Did you enjoy the ride, Mili?

558
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Don't ask her, uncle!
- Shut up!

559
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,000
Remember the ride we took on
the beach before we married?

560
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Sure. And you had run out
of breath after the ride.

561
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
That was because you were with me!
- Really?

562
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Stop it...
not before the children.

563
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Let's go... are we going to stay here?
- Yes. Let's fight in the car.

564
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:03,000
No. Look at that ride there.
- Are we to do only what you wish?

565
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Quiet! Are you going
to fight even here?

566
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Go any place you want to go.
And we'll go wherever we wish.

567
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:25,000
We'll meet at lunch.
Okay?

568
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Talk to her!

569
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
Don't be silly...
there are people around.

570
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:34,000
This is the right time, I say!
Strike when the iron is hot!

571
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
You're crazy! This is no place
to talk about love.

572
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
This is a fair...
and we need silence.

573
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Silence? So I'll go away.
Why must I spoil the fun?

574
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:57,000
There she is... Go on!
And pour out your heart.

575
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Where's Pakya?

576
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,000
He's gone to fetch
some ice cream.

577
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,000
There's something I must tell you.

578
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Actually, there's something
I've got to tell you...

579
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Hurry up! I'm getting late!

580
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:22,000
As I said...
isn't this a great place?

581
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Listen... there's something
I must tell you.

582
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Yes?

583
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:35,000
As I said...
- Go on.

584
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Actually...

585
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
that ride we took, you know?

586
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:43,000
I was scared too.

587
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:46,000
Scared, weren't you?
- Terribly scared.

588
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,000
Isn't that true?
I knew it!

589
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Liar! ...c'mon!

590
00:50:52,000 --> 00:54:16,000
No! Don't hit me!

591
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Kamalji?

592
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
Who are you?

593
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:23,000
Me?

594
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:26,000
I'm Mili.

595
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:31,000
I see you everyday.
At the studio.

596
00:54:31,000 --> 00:55:06,000
I'm a dancer for choreographer
Saroj Khan's troupe.

597
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:09,000
What?! Gulbadan's getting married?

598
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Not just getting married.
She's walking out of our film too!

599
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Walking out? Why?
- We have a lot of love scenes.

600
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:20,000
And Sudhir doesn't approve!
- Now who is Sudhir?

601
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Her driver.

602
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,000
What has her driver
to do with our film?

603
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:32,000
He isn't just her driver.
He owns the car!

604
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:36,000
They're getting married.

605
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,000
You don't mean Gulbadan
is marrying her driver?!

606
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:43,000
Exactly. I went to meet
her Mom early this morning.

607
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:49,000
Her mom told me that since they go
from one studio to another...

608
00:55:49,000 --> 00:56:01,000
they fell in love and
are going to get married.

609
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:05,000
Imagine, Dada! A film heroine
and her driver. In the car.

610
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
They romance in the car.

611
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:10,000
And they marry in the car!

612
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Not even Spielberg
could dream of it!

613
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:17,000
To hell with Speilberg!
You're obsessed with him!

614
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:21,000
She's going to settle down
and I'm going to be ruined!

615
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:24,000
What's going to happen to me?
And to my film?

616
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:28,000
I'll be lynched by my creditors.
- Just tell me...

617
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:33,000
what I've got to do?

618
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Take the call, Motilal.
- Haven't I anything else to do?

619
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Yes, Mili here.

620
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:51,000
What?!

621
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:59,000
Yes, I'm free...

622
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:30,000
Okay...

623
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:35,000
Listen to this!
- Watch out...

624
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:39,000
know what? You're not
going to believe me!

625
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
What happened?

626
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:44,000
You know Raj Kamal, don't you?
- Which Raj Kamal?

627
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:48,000
The film star! Raj Kamal!
- So?

628
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
He telephoned me, Munna!

629
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:54,000
I've just spoken to him!
- Why did he call you?

630
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,000
Guess!
- Tell me.

631
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Try and guess!
- Tell me... I'm no astrologer.

632
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:05,000
He wants me to play the female lead
in his next film!

633
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:08,000
He has called me over
for a screen test tomorrow!

634
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:12,000
What are you talking about?
- It's true! I swear!

635
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
This is it, Munna!

636
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:20,000
I'll deliver such a performance,
speak my lines in such a way...

637
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
I'm going to shock all of them!

638
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:27,000
Your eyes are the most important
thing in acting.

639
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:31,000
Whatever lines you speak...
they must come from your heart.

640
00:58:31,000 --> 00:59:04,000
You must feel them... Okay?

641
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:07,000
Do you...?

642
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:24,000
Can you...?

643
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:27,000
Speak your lines!

644
00:59:27,000 --> 01:00:08,000
Can you...?

645
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Why must you cry?

646
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:16,000
It happens to all of us.
It happened even to me.

647
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:21,000
No, it doesn't.

648
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:25,000
I couldn't speak two lines.

649
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:28,000
I have no right to be there
in front of the camera.

650
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
It's not your mistake.

651
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:34,000
Let's cancel the shoot today.

652
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:39,000
Go home and rehearse your lines.
We'll shoot again tomorrow.

653
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:43,000
You'll do it tomorrow.
Don't worry...

654
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:47,000
Everything will be all right.

655
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:57,000
*Come back to me, my love.
I sing for you*

656
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:01,000
I'm not in!
- It's me, Munna!

657
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:06,000
Hide the bottle...

658
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:09,000
Open the door!
- One moment!

659
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
Sit down here quickly...

660
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:14,000
Hold this paper...
- What is it?

661
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:18,000
You read Rakesh's lines, okay?
- Who's Rakesh?

662
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:22,000
The hero of the film.
Read the lines after me, okay?

663
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:25,000
Let's get cracking.

664
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
What?

665
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Are you in love with me?

666
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:37,000
My God! I hadn't ever dreamed
you'd talk to me like this.

667
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:41,000
I've never thought
like that about you.

668
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:58,000
I don't even know what
to say to you...?

669
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:02,000
Don't stare at me! Read those lines!
It's your part after mine!

670
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:06,000
Well, sure...
- One moment.

671
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:10,000
Now what do I say...

672
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:16,000
"You mean you don't love me?"

673
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
"And I thought..."

674
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Give it to me.
- What now?

675
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:25,000
Is that the way to read...
like a parrot?

676
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
Can't you read it with some feeling?
Bloody idiot!

677
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:32,000
Nonsense! You barge into the room
and ask me to read Rakesh's lines.

678
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:37,000
Now who the hell is Rakesh?
I'm not reading anything!

679
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:41,000
All right. Don't read it!
- Of course I won't!

680
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:50,000
You don't need to do anything.

681
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:55,000
Do you know what happened there...
at the studio?

682
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:59,000
I talk so big out here.

683
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:06,000
And there... I couldn't speak
a single line when it mattered most.

684
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
Not a word.
I had forgotten everything!

685
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:12,000
I looked like a fool!

686
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:15,000
It was only because
of Mr. Raj Kamal...

687
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:20,000
that they agreed to give me
a second chance.

688
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:27,000
They want me there at 9 tomorrow.
And it's already 11.

689
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:31,000
I wanted to rehearse my lines
with someone.

690
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:35,000
So I came to you.

691
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:44,000
Who will help me,
if not you?

692
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
Why should you cry
over such a thing?

693
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:49,000
How would I know it
matters so much to you?

694
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
All right.
I'll speak those lines with you.

695
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:59,000
Once you have practiced with me,
you'll be an expert.

696
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:03,000
"Are you in love with me?
O God!"

697
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:07,000
"I've never thought of you like that"

698
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:11,000
Idiot! They're my lines.

699
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
Damn! I goofed up!

700
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:21,000
It's the other lines I speak.
Rakesh's...

701
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
Will you show me
how to say it?

702
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:27,000
"You know my sister
loves you, Rakesh"

703
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:30,000
"Do you want me to tell my sister
that you love me, and not her?"

704
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
"That you want to marry me?"

705
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:37,000
"Do you realize what she will
go through after hearing that?"

706
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:42,000
"Let alone saying such a thing to her
I can't even think of such a thing"

707
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
"My sister is a very
emotional person"

708
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:49,000
"If she even gets the feeling that
you're in love with me, not her..."

709
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:52,000
"she could even commit suicide"

710
01:04:52,000 --> 01:05:41,000
"Don't let that happen, Rakesh.
Save my sister, please"

711
01:05:41,000 --> 01:06:17,000
What's the time, mister?
- 5.30.

712
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:42,000
What's the time?
- 5.30.

713
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:46,000
What's the time?
- I told you. 5.30.

714
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:49,000
Why are you asking me again and again?
- So what's wrong?

715
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:52,000
I only asked you for the time.
I didn't snatch your watch.

716
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:56,000
Go ahead and read the newspaper.

717
01:06:56,000 --> 01:07:04,000
Mili! Watch out...
what are you doing?

718
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
Shut your eyes!
- What happened?

719
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
Shut your eyes, I say!
- But what's up?

720
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
Shut your eyes...
Go on.

721
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:17,000
Open your eyes now.

722
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
What's this?
- Idiot! It's a check!

723
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:22,000
I'm the heroine now!
- Don't tell me!

724
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:25,000
You've got the film?
- Yes!

725
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:32,000
Didn't I tell you, Mili?
My training's gonna help you!

726
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:53,000
She's a heroine now!

727
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:56,000
Stitch a shirt and trousers
in four hours. Hurry up.

728
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Four hours?
- Of course.

729
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
I'm giving my heroine
a party for the first time.

730
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:03,000
I must look like a hero.
Say what?

731
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
Where are you taking her?
- To a 5-star hotel.

732
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:08,000
I'm taking my heroine to a 5-star
hotel for the first ever time.

733
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:11,000
After a great Chinese meal,
I'll tell her how I feel.

734
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:14,000
It's hit or miss today.
- How will I do it in four hours?

735
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:19,000
Want me hang you up there...?
- I'll handle him. Go on.

736
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:23,000
Hurry up.

737
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:24,000
She's changing.

738
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:29,000
Paint your house again, aunt.
Your daughter's now a heroine.

739
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
Just paint the house, Munna?

740
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:34,000
We're going to get
a new bungalow now.

741
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:43,000
A great new bungalow.

742
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:48,000
Motilal, go to the tailor
and ask him to fetch my dress.

743
01:08:48,000 --> 01:09:06,000
Have I nothing better to do?
- Shirker! You do nothing!

744
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:12,000
Well? Say something!

745
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:15,000
You look ravishing.

746
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:18,000
The car has arrived, sis.
- Has it?

747
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:22,000
What car?
- Mili's going to Kamal's party.

748
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:25,000
What party?
- To celebrate the success...

749
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:28,000
of his film, "Mr. Bond".
They've even sent the car.

750
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:31,000
A Maruti 1000!

751
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:34,000
Do I look okay, Mom?
My hair...?

752
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:37,000
Give Mr. Kamal my regards.

753
01:09:37,000 --> 01:10:12,000
See you later!

754
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:18,000
Munna! I've got your clothes!

755
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:23,000
Here's your shirt and trousers.
Go and change!

756
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
You're gonna look great!
- Don't yell.

757
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:28,000
keep it in my room.

758
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:32,000
What's wrong? You were the one
who asked me to fetch it...

759
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:52,000
I've asked you to keep it in my room.
- Strange.

760
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
What a party!

761
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:57,000
What a glittering function.
A real showman this Raj Kamal is!

762
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:01,000
Do you call this a party?
It's rubbish!

763
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:06,000
I had launched my film.
In America.

764
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:10,000
know Bill Clinton?
He's very close friend of mine.

765
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:14,000
In his backyard,
we put up this huge set.

766
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:17,000
We broke a coconut
to launch the film...

767
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
and blew up the set with a bomb!

768
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:24,000
We shook up the Eiffel Tower!

769
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:28,000
But Eiffel Tower is in Paris,
isn't it?

770
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:54,000
Exactly!
It shook under the impact!

771
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
Hello...

772
01:11:56,000 --> 01:12:01,000
Mr. Kamal's over there.
This way, please.

773
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:04,000
Hello... will you have
something to drink?

774
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:15,000
No thank you.
- Have something?

775
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:19,000
So you are Mili...
wonderful!

776
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:22,000
Do you know me?

777
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:23,000
No...?

778
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:27,000
I'm the one who has
propped up the whole industry.

779
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:31,000
Know Rekha?
- Rekha?

780
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
The film actress...?

781
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:37,000
Oh yes. Rekha...

782
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:44,000
I was the one who gave
her the name Rekha.

783
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
She's so famous.

784
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
Who...?
- Rekha.

785
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:51,000
What did I give her?
- Her name.

786
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
I was the one who gave her
the first break.

787
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:56,000
And Sridevi. When she first
arrived in Bombay from Madras...

788
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:59,000
I was the one who taught her Hindi.
What did I teach her?

789
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:02,000
Hindi.
- Whom?

790
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
Sridevi.
- Forget Sridevi.

791
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:09,000
Take Amitabh Bachchan.
I've known him since he was a kid.

792
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:14,000
When he had left the industry
and was going away to Allahabad...

793
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:18,000
I stopped him at the railway station.
I asked him why he was leaving.

794
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:21,000
He said things weren't working out
and that he was going away.

795
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:25,000
I asked him to hang on.
I called Prakash Mehra...

796
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:28,000
and got him to sign "Zanjeer".
Which film...?

797
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
"Zanjeer"

798
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:33,000
So which film did I get
Amitabh Bachchan to star in?

799
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:38,000
I was the one.
I'll make your life too.

800
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:42,000
So you were the one who
got Amitabh Bachchan "Zanjeer"

801
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
Of course. There!
He knows it too!

802
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:48,000
Smart waiters we have nowadays!

803
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:53,000
And who called you here?
- The producer P.P. Did.

804
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:56,000
He is a childhood friend.
- Really?

805
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:00,000
Don't touch me!
- My name is P.P.

806
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:04,000
Really? Congratulations!
- Get out!

807
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:22,000
Bum! You drink free liquor
and talk nonsense... Get out!

808
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:29,000
I didn't know what to say!
He spoke such nonsense!

809
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:32,000
He talked as if he knew everyone
from Rekha to Amitabh...

810
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
right from their childhood!

811
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:38,000
You will meet even stranger people.
And everybody has a story to tell.

812
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:42,000
But I'm not here to
tell stories.

813
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:46,000
It's as if one gets to
see such a big world...

814
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:51,000
far removed from our daily lives.
Everything is so beautiful!

815
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:55,000
There are so many
beautiful things.

816
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:58,000
There's music, dance,
story, photography...

817
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:04,000
all of which go to make a film.

818
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
Who do you have in the family?

819
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:10,000
My Papa, Mom and a little brother.

820
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:15,000
He's a bit of a cartoon.
He's not interested in films.

821
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:18,000
But when there's a song being
played on Tv...

822
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
he keeps looking for me in
the maze of all the dancers...

823
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:28,000
"There you are, Mili",
he says!

824
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:41,000
Who do you have in the family?

825
01:15:41,000 --> 01:16:16,000
Let's go. We're getting late.

826
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:19,000
You've woken up early today.

827
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:22,000
When did I sleep that I'd wake up?

828
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
I couldn't go to sleep...

829
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
thinking about the things
that happened at the party.

830
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:31,000
*I can't go to sleep

831
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
*I find no peace

832
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
*Will someone get me
some tea...?*

833
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:38,000
*What are you looking for
in the newspaper?*

834
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:42,000
I'm looking for something
written about the party...

835
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:46,000
The party took place only last night.
Who'd get the stuff so early?

836
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:50,000
It'll take some time.
- It was no ordinary party, daddy.

837
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:55,000
It was a grand affair! D'you know
how many influential people attended?

838
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:59,000
It was simply terrific!

839
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,000
They used to take a picture
every other minute.

840
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:07,000
I was tired wearing a smile
for all the pictures!

841
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:16,000
What is it?

842
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:19,000
Well? What's so funny?

843
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:24,000
I come to you dressed so well.
And you laugh at me!

844
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
What's wrong with you?

845
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:31,000
And what's wrong with you, Munna?
What stuff are you wearing?

846
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:35,000
Stuff...? This is style, baby.

847
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:38,000
The latest fashion.
Better than the hero of your film.

848
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:43,000
Really?
But what's all that style for?

849
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:46,000
It's my happy birthday.

850
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:47,000
Your birthday?

851
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:50,000
Well? Can't I even have
a happy birthday?

852
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:53,000
I'm going to give you a party.

853
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:56,000
Where?

854
01:17:56,000 --> 01:18:00,000
Here you are...
I tipped him with 2 bucks.

855
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:03,000
Why did you have to bring me
to such a big hotel?

856
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:06,000
I'll show you what
life is all about.

857
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:11,000
This place is open 24 hours a day.
They've spent so much.

858
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
What is it?

859
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
Where'll I get a bite?

860
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:19,000
C'mon.

861
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:22,000
The guys here know me.

862
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:30,000
Where do you want to sit?
- Here?

863
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:38,000
This chair's slipping!

864
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
Anybody here?

865
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:54,000
Boy! Come here!

866
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:57,000
He wants to know what
you will eat.

867
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:03,000
So talk to me in Hindi...
what can I have?

868
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:08,000
No English stuff.
Give us something that is filling.

869
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:13,000
Get us some onions, to begin with.
And some brain-fry, usal and bread...

870
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:18,000
egg-curry and rice
with some curry.

871
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:21,000
Munna!
You don't get that stuff here!

872
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:25,000
No?

873
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:29,000
A rotten place! Do you guys
spend only on the furniture?

874
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:32,000
All right.
Get us anything you like.

875
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
And lots. I'm loaded with dough.

876
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
Think it's you who's eating.

877
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:39,000
Listen, switch on the fan.

878
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:46,000
Switch on the fan.
- The air conditioning is on, sir.

879
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:56,000
So turn it this way.

880
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:59,000
That Deepak of Tikuwadi...
- Deepak?

881
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
That chap who met us at the fair.

882
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:04,000
Oh yes. The guy with the bicycle?
- That's him.

883
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:08,000
What happened to him?
- He has settled down in life.

884
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:12,000
Settled down?
- I mean, he got married.

885
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:18,000
Really? Whom has he married?
- Chameli. Who lived in his colony.

886
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
They've got married.

887
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:24,000
They're very happy.

888
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:27,000
That's what I think too.
One must settle down.

889
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:30,000
You're right.

890
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:33,000
You think so too, isn't it?
Just what I think.

891
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:38,000
One must settle down in life.
Life would be settled if one...

892
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:43,000
What are you talking about, Munna?

893
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:48,000
Well... you think one must
settle down in life, isn't it?

894
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:51,000
That's just what I want.
To settle down in life.

895
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:56,000
I mean...

896
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:59,000
all I've told you is that
one must settle down in life.

897
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:06,000
Kamalji!

898
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:10,000
Mili!

899
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:13,000
You?
- What are you doing here?

900
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:19,000
I came here with my friend, Munna.

901
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:24,000
I know... you're a good fighter.

902
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:28,000
What are you doing here?
- I came to see Mr. Kamalakar Rao.

903
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:32,000
Kamalakar Rao? The director?
- Yes.

904
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
Want to meet him?
- Of course!

905
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:37,000
So let's go.
- Right now?

906
01:21:37,000 --> 01:22:27,000
I'll be back soon, Munna.
Let's go.

907
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:33,000
Hurry up and bring it!
- One moment. I'm coming.

908
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:37,000
White Gulab Jamum, mom?
- It's Rossogolla, not gulab-jamun.

909
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:40,000
But I asked for gulab-jamun!
- This is Mili's choice.

910
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:43,000
So I made rossogollas.
- Mili! Am I not your son?

911
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:47,000
Don't give me those filmi lines!
I'll make gulab-jamun tomorrow.

912
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
I want it today.
Or I'm not going to eat.

913
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:53,000
Don't be stubborn, son.
This is extremely delicious.

914
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:57,000
Try some...
- Not you. keep it back there!

915
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:00,000
Just one...?
- The doctor has forbidden it.

916
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:04,000
The doctor forbids sweet for me.
You forbid me from drinking...

917
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:08,000
Looks like everybody
is stopping me from living!

918
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:12,000
What are you doing? Didn't I say
I'd make some for you tomorrow?

919
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:15,000
You're partial towards Mili.
And you keep shouting at me!

920
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
I know I'm not your son!
- One slap you'll get!

921
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:20,000
Eat quietly...
- No, mom! Not for me.

922
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
Why not?
- I'm on a diet.

923
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:26,000
I'm the sucker! I woke up at 6
to make rossogollas for you...

924
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:29,000
and you're dieting, the doctor
forbids sweets for him...

925
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:32,000
and this chap doesn't like it!
Even Munna has refused to eat!

926
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:35,000
Why has Munna refused to eat?
He loves rossogollas.

927
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:39,000
I sent Motilal to call him.
He says he's not hungry.

928
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:44,000
Why didn't you come and eat?
- I'm not hungry.

929
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:47,000
Not hungry...?
You're okay, I hope?

930
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:50,000
I'm first class.
- So why aren't you hungry?

931
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:54,000
Just like that.

932
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:57,000
All right.
I'm not going to eat either.

933
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:01,000
Why not?
- Just like that.

934
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:05,000
But I am terribly hungry.
- So eat if you're hungry!

935
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
I won't.
- Why not?

936
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:13,000
Because I want to eat with you.

937
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,000
Let's go.

938
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:20,000
I can't understand your
mood nowadays, Munna.

939
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:24,000
That film industry of yours...
it's not right.

940
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:25,000
What?

941
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:29,000
know what Pakya said yesterday?

942
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:32,000
Who the hell is Pakya to say
anything about the film industry?

943
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
You are he and great
experts, are you?

944
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:38,000
Don't tell me! I've seen more
in the world than you have!

945
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:41,000
Behind all that glitter,
it's so bloody hollow!

946
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
Don't I know?

947
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:46,000
There are a few bad eggs, all right.
That doesn't make all of them evil.

948
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:49,000
Would I work with them
if they were like that?

949
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:52,000
Or don't you trust me at all?
- Did I say that?

950
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:55,000
That's just what you meant.
- You're twisting what I said!

951
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,000
You really do think like that.

952
01:24:57,000 --> 01:25:02,000
I said it only because
I'm worried about you.

953
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
Let's go and eat. C'mon.

954
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:07,000
C'mon...
- I'm not hungry.

955
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,000
C'mon, I say...
- I don't want to eat.

956
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:13,000
All right.
I'm not going to eat either.

957
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:20,000
I have rats in my tummy
out of hunger. Big ones.

958
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:26,000
Let's go.

959
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:31,000
The sea looks so beautiful
from out here!

960
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:35,000
Do you own all this land?
- The Government owns some too.

961
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,000
I'm kidding.

962
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:41,000
I want to build a house here.
- A house? Here?

963
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
That's right.
- But there's not a soul here!

964
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
That's precisely why.

965
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:50,000
People run behind you, Kamalji.
And you run away from them.

966
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:56,000
How do you feel when people
assemble in crowds...

967
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:59,000
to shake hands with you, or have
themselves photographed with you...

968
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:03,000
or some to even gape at you?

969
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,000
How d'you expect me to feel?
I know very well...

970
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:09,000
that they're looking for a Kamal
who fights twenty men on screen...

971
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:12,000
who runs around those trees
singing songs...

972
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:16,000
They don't seek the real Kamal
who had to go through so much...

973
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:19,000
to be the Kamal he is today.

974
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:22,000
Tell me, Kamalji.
How did you land your first break?

975
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:28,000
It's a very long story.
- I want to hear it. Now!

976
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:33,000
You'll find it boring.
- I really want to hear it. Please!

977
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:37,000
All right.

978
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:41,000
And then... Kamal turned "Kamalji"

979
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:44,000
The star!

980
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:47,000
Suchitra called me funny names too.

981
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:52,000
When I wore blue, she called me
"Neel Kamal" (the blue lotus).

982
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:57,000
When I did a scene in water, she
called me "Jal Kamal" (water lotus)

983
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:06,000
She said that Hollywood
would call me "Lotus kumar"

984
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:09,000
Who's Suchitra?

985
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:12,000
You'd have gone crazy with
laughter, if you had met you.

986
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:16,000
After I became a star,
I had lots of money.

987
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:25,000
I bought a car. I took Suchitra
on a long drive. To Khandala.

988
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:32,000
She kept cracking jokes
and I kept laughing...

989
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:41,000
I drove at top speed and...

990
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:45,000
In a matter of seconds,
it was all over.

991
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:58,000
Our dreams of marriage, of a
happy home... were all shattered.

992
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:07,000
I don't talk about it to anyone.
I can't help it sometimes...

993
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:38,000
We'll meet at the shoot tomorrow.

994
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:42,000
I must tell Mili about this!

995
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:48,000
You will? You don't have the
guts to tell her how you feel.

996
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:51,000
There you go again.

997
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:54,000
Had you been in my shoes,
you'd have known.

998
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:58,000
Admit it! You don't have the guts.
- As if you have it!

999
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
know what happened the other day?
- What?

1000
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:03,000
That female Meena...
- Deccan Queen?

1001
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:09,000
That's the one. She was passing by
Gautan Galli the other day.

1002
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:13,000
I caught hold of her and took her
to a quiet corner.

1003
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:18,000
"I want to marry you", I said.
"I'm going to get a room for us"

1004
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:22,000
"Our kids will go to an English school...
will you marry me", I asked.

1005
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:25,000
You said it to her?
- I did!

1006
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:28,000
What happened then?
- What else?

1007
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:31,000
She beat me with her slippers.
- What?!

1008
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:36,000
Slipper?
- Here it is!

1009
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:40,000
Smart-ass! You got beaten up.
And you still brag!

1010
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:43,000
You talk of daring!
- But I did it, didn't I?

1011
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:46,000
I'm not a coward like you!

1012
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:55,000
Show that daring anymore and you'll
soon have to peddle ladies-footwear!

1013
01:29:55,000 --> 01:30:04,000
You need a beating, Peter.
You're freaking out nowadays.

1014
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
They're shooting
a film out there.

1015
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:10,000
Oh yes! They're shooting
a film down there!

1016
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
Let's get down there
and take a look.

1017
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:36,000
Let's take a look at the heroine!
C'mon!

1018
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:45,000
A few strands of hair down
like this... the natural look.

1019
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:50,000
Just a few strands.

1020
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:54,000
That bus we wanted for tomorrow's
shoot... we can't have it, sir.

1021
01:30:54,000 --> 01:31:01,000
Could we manage with an autorickshaw?
- We'll manage with even a bicycle.

1022
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:05,000
What's okay?
- The autorickshaw...?

1023
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:08,000
I'll call pack up if
I don't have the bus!

1024
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:11,000
Your producer wants to
make the film with nothing!

1025
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:14,000
I'm not into television serials!
I'm making a 70 mm feature film!

1026
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:17,000
I'll halt the shoot if I don't
have the bus. Understand?

1027
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:20,000
I want the bus!
No compromises!

1028
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:26,000
How will someone ever make
a film like this? How?

1029
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:30,000
These rich guys are such misers!
And what will happen of art?

1030
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:34,000
I want to create things...
how will that happen?

1031
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:37,000
And I'm not competing
with the local guys!

1032
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,000
I'm competing with Copolla.
With Spielberg!

1033
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:43,000
How do I make them understand?
I just don't know!

1034
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:48,000
You tell me... how can anyone
ever make a real, artistic film?

1035
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:52,000
I understand your predicament.

1036
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:55,000
And who are you?
- I came to watch you shoot.

1037
01:31:55,000 --> 01:32:01,000
The shoot?
Get lost... Get going!

1038
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:05,000
The shot's ready, Miliji.
- The heroine's ready!

1039
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:11,000
Will you tango with me?

1040
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:16,000
Such an ill-mannered crowd.
I wonder where they come from.

1041
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:21,000
You there! Hero! If you're man
enough, how about fighting me?

1042
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:38,000
You get into fights in the movies.
How about a fight with me...?

1043
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:41,000
"I'm in love with you, Rakesh..."

1044
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:45,000
I love you too, baby!

1045
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:48,000
Don't pay any attention to them.
Just concentrate on your lines.

1046
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:51,000
Come, let's sing a song.

1047
01:32:51,000 --> 01:33:30,000
Hey darling...!

1048
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:34,000
Kamal... call me just Kamal.

1049
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:37,000
How can I be so informal?

1050
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:46,000
What's the problem? We've got to
work together, meet each other...

1051
01:33:46,000 --> 01:34:20,000
Imagine me calling you "Miliji"
for every little thing!

1052
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:26,000
Well? You think you're
very smart, don't you?

1053
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:29,000
You're the bully
in your locality.

1054
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:34,000
You talk so much when you're
up against the cops.

1055
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:37,000
But when it comes to saying
something to the girl...

1056
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:41,000
you blow a fuse!
You're speechless!

1057
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:49,000
You ought to drown out of shame,
you ass!

1058
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:53,000
Looks like I'll have to do
something about it.

1059
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:58,000
Had she been here right now,
I swear I'd have told her.

1060
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:05,000
What would you have said?
- I...

1061
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:11,000
What would you have said, Munna?

1062
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:23,000
I... what will I say?

1063
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,000
Damn it!

1064
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:28,000
Anybody around?

1065
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:31,000
Wake up, guys!

1066
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,000
Shut that thunder!

1067
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:34,000
Are you listening...?

1068
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:44,000
Wake up!

1069
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:47,000
Who is it? Why are you screaming?

1070
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:51,000
Who are you...?
Why are you yelling?

1071
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:54,000
Who the hell are you?
You've wrecked my windowpane!

1072
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:59,000
My heart is worth millions.
That has been wrecked.

1073
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,000
And you're crying over
a measly windowpanes!

1074
01:36:01,000 --> 01:37:25,000
Come down here...
I'll tell you my love story today.

1075
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:29,000
*What must I do and what
mustn't I do is the problem*

1076
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:34,000
*Someone tell me the way
out of this predicament*

1077
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:38,000
*On the one hand,
I'm very much in love with her...*

1078
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:42,000
*On the other hand,
I'm afraid to tell her*

1079
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:47,000
*What I must do and what I mustn't
is the problem*

1080
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:51,000
*Someone tell me the way
out of this predicament*

1081
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:55,000
*On the one hand,
I do love her*

1082
01:37:55,000 --> 01:38:46,000
*On the other,
I'm afraid to tell her*

1083
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:54,000
*I think everyday that
should I meet her...*

1084
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:58,000
*I'll tell her this,
and tell her that...*

1085
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:03,000
*I'll reveal to her
the secrets of my heart*

1086
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:07,000
*But she has to come before me
and my heart skips a beat*

1087
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:11,000
*And I find myself tongue-tied*

1088
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:16,000
*So what am I to do?
And what mustn't I do?*

1089
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:20,000
*Someone tell me a way out
of this predicament*

1090
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:24,000
*I sure do love her*

1091
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:28,000
*And I'm scared to tell her*

1092
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:33,000
*What am I to do...?
What mustn't I do?*

1093
01:39:33,000 --> 01:40:33,000
*Suggest a way out someone*

1094
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:41,000
*It's no big deal.
I could have said it to her*

1095
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:49,000
*All I'm scared of
is a refusal*

1096
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:54,000
*Must I tell her now?
Or later...? And where?*

1097
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:58,000
*She left, even as I wondered*

1098
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:02,000
*What am I to do...?
And what mustn't I?*

1099
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:06,000
*Suggest a way out of this,
someone*

1100
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
*Will someone...?*

1101
01:41:08,000 --> 01:42:07,000
*Will someone...?*

1102
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:12,000
Mili...

1103
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
She's gone to sleep.

1104
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
Gone to asleep?
- Yes.

1105
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:20,000
So early?
- She must've been tired.

1106
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:23,000
Come. Have a drink.

1107
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:25,000
What do you get
out of drinking?

1108
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:31,000
Some people drink to
forget their past...

1109
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:35,000
some drink to revive the memories.

1110
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:45,000
And there are guys like me who
drink without any reason, Munna.

1111
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:51,000
I want to ask you something, uncle.
I hope you won't mind?

1112
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:54,000
What are you talking about!

1113
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:58,000
Have you ever been in love?

1114
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:02,000
Love? What a topic to discuss, Munna!

1115
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:12,000
Let me pour myself
another drink. Okay?

1116
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:15,000
It happened when I was in the
first year of graduation.

1117
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:17,000
She was into the first year, too.

1118
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:22,000
For four years,
we came and went in the same bus...

1119
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:27,000
the same timing, the same route.

1120
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:29,000
Really?

1121
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:34,000
Our love story moved ahead
with the bus.

1122
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
What happened then?

1123
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:39,000
What else? She married someone
who drove around in a car...

1124
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:43,000
and I got left behind in the bus.
- But why?

1125
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:45,000
Not her mistake.

1126
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:49,000
We lost out because I wasn't sure
whether I should speak to her.

1127
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:54,000
I just couldn't tell her
how I felt!

1128
01:43:54,000 --> 01:44:01,000
You're telling me...
- I learnt a lesson, however.

1129
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:06,000
Cause no delay in
speaking your heart.

1130
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:10,000
You're right. Make no delay.

1131
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:24,000
Make no delay.

1132
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:29,000
I must leave now.
- Very well.

1133
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:39,000
Dada!

1134
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:40,000
What is it?

1135
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,000
Have you ever been in love?

1136
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:46,000
What...?
- Have you been in love?

1137
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:49,000
Tell me!
- I'll tell you!

1138
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:53,000
She was so very beautiful.

1139
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:56,000
But I couldn't have her.
- But I've found mine!

1140
01:44:56,000 --> 01:45:05,000
You've found Mili?!

1141
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:11,000
Got it?
- Mili...?

1142
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:16,000
They've got permission
for the outdoor shoot.

1143
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:19,000
In Goa?
- Don't shout.

1144
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:21,000
How did she go there?
- In a car.

1145
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:23,000
I know that.
But what for?

1146
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:26,000
She's gone to shoot for
the film. What else?

1147
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:29,000
How could she go away like that?
She didn't even tell me.

1148
01:45:29,000 --> 01:46:09,000
The producer made a sudden program.
So she left early this morning.

1149
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:13,000
*A life of loneliness...
that's not done*

1150
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:18,000
*You have no companion...
that's not done*

1151
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:23,000
*Give someone your love;
and have someone's love in return*

1152
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:28,000
*Love is what you want
in the world*

1153
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:33,000
*To lead a life of loneliness
is not done*

1154
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:38,000
*You have no companion...
that's not done*

1155
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:44,000
*Give someone your love;
enjoy her affection*

1156
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:49,000
*That's the best thing
in the world*

1157
01:46:49,000 --> 01:47:48,000
*To lead a life of loneliness
is not done*

1158
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:53,000
*You ought to dream of someone*

1159
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:57,000
*You ought to have
someone in your arms*

1160
01:47:57,000 --> 01:48:02,000
*You ought to have a companion
in your journey through life*

1161
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:08,000
*You must have a companion
in your journey through life*

1162
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:13,000
*Life though is a punishment...*

1163
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:18,000
*but to have someone
would make it fun*

1164
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:22,000
*To lead a life of loneliness
is hardly the thing*

1165
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:27,000
*You have no beloved;
that is hardly done*

1166
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:32,000
*Give your love to someone;
enjoy her love*

1167
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:37,000
*That's the best thing
in the world*

1168
01:48:37,000 --> 01:49:39,000
*To lead a life of loneliness
is hardly done*

1169
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:44,000
*Apart from the earth and the sky,
there's so much here*

1170
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:49,000
*The waves lash us...
here I am*

1171
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:54,000
*Even the moonlight seems
to be saying something to us*

1172
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:59,000
*Even the moonlight seems
to be saying something to us*

1173
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:04,000
*Something is saying something
to you from the heart*

1174
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:09,000
*Distances won't do...
come closer*

1175
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:13,000
*To lead a life of loneliness
is hardly the done thing*

1176
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:19,000
*You have no beloved...
that's hardly done*

1177
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:24,000
*Give her your love;
enjoy hers*

1178
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:29,000
*That's the best thing
in the world*

1179
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:34,000
*To lead a life of loneliness
is hardly the done thing*

1180
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,000
*It's hardly done...*

1181
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:39,000
*it's hardly done*

1182
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:58,000
*it's hardly done*

1183
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:03,000
*To lead a life of loneliness
is hardly the done thing*

1184
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:08,000
*You have no beloved;
that's not done*

1185
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:14,000
*Give someone your love;
enjoy her love...*

1186
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:21,000
Fantastic! If this song clicks,
our film's gonna be a hit!

1187
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:22,000
I'm not worried anymore.

1188
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:25,000
Will the film be a hit,
just because the song clicks?

1189
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:28,000
Of course! Look at the record
of any recent success.

1190
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:32,000
"Tezaab" for instance.
The number, "Ek, do, teen..."

1191
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:37,000
Or the case of "khalnayak".
"Choli ke peechhe kya hai..."

1192
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:38,000
Wasn't that a hit?

1193
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:41,000
You had four hit songs
in your last film.

1194
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:45,000
Why didn't the film do well?
- Well...

1195
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:49,000
It's up to the director
to make a hit film!

1196
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:52,000
Up to whom?
- The director.

1197
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:55,000
What...?
- The director, I said.

1198
01:51:55,000 --> 01:52:05,000
Whom is it up to to make a hit film?
- Up to you, sir!

1199
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:08,000
The loudmouth!

1200
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:12,000
Do you know why my
last film flopped?

1201
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:15,000
Well, what was the
name of the film...?

1202
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:17,000
That's not what
I'm talking about!

1203
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:26,000
I didn't take the print of my film
to the shrine at Tirupati. That's why!

1204
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,000
What are you doing up there?
Come here!

1205
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,000
Get back there!
- Don't touch me!

1206
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,000
I'm Mili's friend, I say!
- They all say that. Get lost!

1207
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:36,000
You'll get a punch!
Don't you touch me!

1208
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:39,000
There... you've had it!

1209
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:41,000
You must know whom
you're talking to.

1210
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:44,000
How did you get here?

1211
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,000
I've come straight
from the bus-station.

1212
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:50,000
You know him, Kamalji? Remember...
you met him at the restaurant?

1213
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:58,000
Oh yes... Raju.
- No. The name is Munna.

1214
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:04,000
What brings you here suddenly?
- Wouldn't I come today?

1215
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:07,000
But what for?
- Isn't it your birthday today?

1216
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:10,000
You haven't told us
it's your birthday!

1217
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:13,000
What's so great about that?

1218
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:21,000
Listen! It's Mili's birthday!

1219
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:24,000
What are you thinking about?

1220
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:27,000
Don't think too much.
Or you'll miss the bus.

1221
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:30,000
Remember the film you saw?
How did the hero...

1222
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:32,000
present a ring to the heroine
and they fall in love?

1223
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:36,000
Go ahead and give her the ring.
Play the hero!

1224
01:53:36,000 --> 01:54:18,000
Get on with it!

1225
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:22,000
Munna! Look at what
Kamalji has given me!

1226
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,000
It's beautiful, isn't it?

1227
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:29,000
I didn't want to take it.
But he insisted!

1228
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:37,000
It's so very beautiful.

1229
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:43,000
But I don't like it.

1230
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:51,000
It will look beautiful
only when you have worn it.

1231
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:58,000
One moment.

1232
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:07,000
What do you do for a living?

1233
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:12,000
I sell tickets in the black-market.
- What?

1234
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:22,000
I sell tickets in the black
outside cinema halls.

1235
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:26,000
It looks beautiful now.

1236
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:31,000
But not more than you are.

1237
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:37,000
Shall we go?

1238
01:55:37,000 --> 01:56:29,000
Munna! C'mon!

1239
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:40,000
Where's Munna?
- Who's that?

1240
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:43,000
When did you return from Goa?
- Last night.

1241
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:48,000
And you didn't even meet me!
- Why should I have met you?

1242
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:53,000
I was dying to know what happened.
- What was to happen?

1243
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:55,000
Did you talk to her?
- Talk to whom?

1244
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:58,000
Mili, of course! Who else?

1245
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
No, nothing.
- Nothing?

1246
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,000
Nothing, I say!
- Why not?

1247
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:05,000
I said there was nothing!
Don't bother me!

1248
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:08,000
You went to talk to her, right?
- But I didn't get the chance. So?

1249
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:11,000
Don't bother me!
Go away!

1250
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:15,000
*What is love...?*

1251
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:20,000
*It's so strange...*

1252
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,000
*It hurts*

1253
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:25,000
*It gives peace*

1254
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:40,000
*It gives joy.
It gives sorrow*

1255
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:45,000
*What is love...?*

1256
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:50,000
*It's so strange...*

1257
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:52,000
*It hurts*

1258
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:55,000
*It gives solace*

1259
01:57:55,000 --> 01:58:00,000
*It gives joy;
it gives sorrow*

1260
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:05,000
*What is love*

1261
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:09,000
*It's so strange*

1262
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:14,000
*It hurts;
it soothes*

1263
01:58:14,000 --> 01:59:05,000
*It gives joy;
it gives sorrow*

1264
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:10,000
*I spend my days
thinking about her*

1265
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:15,000
*My nights too,
I spend missing her*

1266
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:19,000
*I dream of our union*

1267
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:24,000
*And flowers and roses announce
the arrival of spring*

1268
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:29,000
*Bees swarm around the flowers*

1269
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:34,000
*May our hearts always
be filled with love*

1270
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:39,000
*What is love...?*

1271
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:43,000
*It's so strange*

1272
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:48,000
*It hurts;
it soothes*

1273
01:59:48,000 --> 02:00:34,000
*It gives sorrow;
it gives joy*

1274
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:39,000
*Like a dream
in my eyes*

1275
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:44,000
*Like a thought
in the form of a dream*

1276
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:48,000
*As we walk through
the hot sun...*

1277
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:54,000
*a beloved who would
provide me shade*

1278
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:56,000
*Our destination we
reach or not...*

1279
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,000
*be there storms...*

1280
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:03,000
*it teaches every lover
the way of life*

1281
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:08,000
*What is love...?*

1282
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:13,000
*It's so strange*

1283
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:18,000
*It hurts;
it soothes*

1284
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:23,000
*It's a source of happiness;
it gives sorrow*

1285
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:28,000
*What is love...?*

1286
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:32,000
*It's so strange*

1287
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:37,000
*It hurts;
it soothes*

1288
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:43,000
*It's a source of joy
and sorrows*

1289
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:46,000
Dada!
- Mr. P.P.?!

1290
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:50,000
*Give someone your love...
enjoy her affection*

1291
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:54,000
*That's the dearest
thing in the world*

1292
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:58,000
*To lead a life of loneliness
is no life*

1293
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:03,000
What's up?
- Our first print is out!

1294
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:06,000
Congratulations...
when was it out?

1295
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:11,000
I just saw it at the lab.!
What a film!

1296
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:15,000
Our distributors are going to
book each theater for 2 years!

1297
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:20,000
If this film doesn't click,
I'm going back to Ludhiana!

1298
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:23,000
As for Mili...
what a performance!

1299
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:26,000
She's fantastic!

1300
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:30,000
When can I see the film?
- Any time you want to!

1301
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:42,000
Sweeten his tongue!

1302
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:45,000
You've been sitting here and
I've been looking for you everywhere.

1303
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:49,000
There's a screening of my film.
At 8 p.m.

1304
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:51,000
Be there. I'll wait for you.
Don't be late!

1305
02:02:51,000 --> 02:03:10,000
Bring Pakya along too!

1306
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:15,000
What a fantastic dancer!
I haven't forgotten.

1307
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:17,000
Of course I'll remind him.

1308
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:26,000
There's a screening of
the film this evening.

1309
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:37,000
I want to give this to Mili.

1310
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:41,000
But I don't know why...
I have a fear.

1311
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:45,000
What fear?

1312
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:51,000
After Suchitra's death,
I'm scared of every joy.

1313
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:53,000
Lest the happiness be
snatched away from me.

1314
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:59,000
How can you think of such things?
You ought to be happy. Not scared.

1315
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:03,000
Besides, the two of you will
make a terrific couple.

1316
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:06,000
I have just one dream now.

1317
02:04:06,000 --> 02:05:24,000
I want to see you married.

1318
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:27,000
*What's wrong with you...?*

1319
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:31,000
*You have been
pestering me all the time*

1320
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:39,000
*You are so very beautiful...
how can I control myself*

1321
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:46,000
*Go away...
I feel shy*

1322
02:05:46,000 --> 02:06:58,000
*It's this charm of yours
that I'm bowled over by*

1323
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:06,000
*My God...!
You are so very insistent*

1324
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:13,000
*Let me go...
you've begun to scare me*

1325
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:21,000
*I've decided to spend my days
and nights, making love*

1326
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:29,000
*What makes you so scared
of my love, O beloved*

1327
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:36,000
*What's wrong with you...
You've been pestering me always*

1328
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:43,000
*You're so bewitching...
how can I keep myself in control*

1329
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:51,000
*Go away...
I feel shy*

1330
02:07:51,000 --> 02:08:37,000
*It's this very charm of yours
that has bowled me over*

1331
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:44,000
*Your fair arms, your body...
they make me so restless*

1332
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:48,000
*Your wet lips and
your intoxicating eyes...*

1333
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:51,000
*awaken the desires in me*

1334
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:55,000
*Let go of my arms...*

1335
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:59,000
*don't block my path*

1336
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:03,000
*Say not such things...*

1337
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:07,000
*Let me go*

1338
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:14,000
*What's gotten into you...?
You've been pestering me so*

1339
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:22,000
*You're so seductive...
how can I be unaffected?*

1340
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:29,000
*Go away...
I'm shy*

1341
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:51,000
*It's this very charm of yours
that has bowled me over*

1342
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:58,000
What's wrong? I've been calling out
to you and you're... what's up?

1343
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:02,000
And I wondered whether
I was late.

1344
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:04,000
Shall we go?

1345
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:08,000
I...
- Yes?

1346
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:17,000
There's something...
- What is it?

1347
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:20,000
Any problem with the film?

1348
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:24,000
God! Can't you think of anything
but the film?

1349
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:26,000
Not me.

1350
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:31,000
You've had so many releases, Kamal.
You won't understand.

1351
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:34,000
But to see myself on the screen
for the first time...

1352
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:36,000
do you know how scared I am?

1353
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:42,000
Have you ever been scared?
- No. Never earlier.

1354
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:44,000
What does that mean?

1355
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:49,000
Nothing. Shall we go?

1356
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:52,000
Welcome...

1357
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:56,000
Look. This is the response
before the film's release.

1358
02:10:56,000 --> 02:11:00,000
We'll need the army to control
the crowds on its release!

1359
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:03,000
Sit down...

1360
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:06,000
Get up, you guys.
Who are you?

1361
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:08,000
We're Mili's friends.
That heroine of yours...

1362
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:11,000
Fantastic! They're all the
heroine's and hero's friends.

1363
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:14,000
And the producer's enemies!
Are you here for a party?

1364
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:18,000
Never mind, P.P.
I'll see the film later.

1365
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:21,000
No, sir.
You will see the film today.

1366
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:25,000
Get up... do you want me
to call the security guards?

1367
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:28,000
They land up for a free show!
- Let's go, Pakya.

1368
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:33,000
Go on... don't stare!

1369
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:38,000
Please sit down, sir...
you too.

1370
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:42,000
I'll get them to start the film.
Okay?

1371
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:46,000
You guys are still here?
Didn't I ask you to go away?

1372
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:48,000
Don't you touch me!
Or you'll get a punch!

1373
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:50,000
Oh get lost!
You too...

1374
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:56,000
Whom do you think you're pushing!
I'll teach you a lesson!

1375
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:57,000
I'll smash your face!

1376
02:11:57,000 --> 02:12:05,000
Munna! What are you doing?

1377
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:11,000
I asked him to occupy another seat.
There are distributors here...

1378
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:14,000
and he started
abusing and hitting me.

1379
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:16,000
Munna! What behavior is this?

1380
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:19,000
It's our film! And this is how
you behave with the guests?

1381
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:22,000
At least listen to me, Mili...
- That's okay.

1382
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:30,000
Welcome, Mr. Kamal...
they're waiting for you.

1383
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:36,000
And Mili was angry with us, Munna!

1384
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:52,000
Let's go.

1385
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:59,000
One moment, Mili...

1386
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:02,000
This way, Mili...
this way!

1387
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:05,000
Kamal! What are you doing?

1388
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:09,000
You're a big star now!
So this is inevitable...

1389
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:12,000
Never mind all that.

1390
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:15,000
You haven't told me what
you think of my performance.

1391
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:19,000
What did I think of it?
The world applauded you!

1392
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:24,000
Not the world...
I want to know how you felt.

1393
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:27,000
Want to know the truth?

1394
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:32,000
That shot on the beach,
where you're looking at me...

1395
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:36,000
I just loved it.
You looked absolutely beautiful.

1396
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:40,000
I mean it.
- You're embarrassing me.

1397
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:43,000
I swear...

1398
02:13:43,000 --> 02:14:28,000
You looked beautiful...

1399
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:31,000
What for?

1400
02:14:31,000 --> 02:14:36,000
For those things I said
to you at the theater.

1401
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:39,000
I so badly wanted to see the film...

1402
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:44,000
that I told you whatever
came to my mind.

1403
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:49,000
I've made a mistake.
- How is it your mistake?

1404
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:51,000
There were so many
big personalities there.

1405
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:54,000
It wouldn't have been proper
for me to be among them.

1406
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:57,000
What you did was right.
I should have known better.

1407
02:14:57,000 --> 02:14:59,000
Munna! Why are you
saying such things?

1408
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:06,000
I admit I've made a mistake!

1409
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:13,000
Forget it.
How was the film?

1410
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:16,000
I can't believe it, Munna!

1411
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:19,000
People liked the film so much!

1412
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:24,000
There was applause in every scene!
As for me...

1413
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:27,000
they adored me, Munna!

1414
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:30,000
I missed you very much
when that happened.

1415
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:35,000
How I bored you to death
with my fascination for films.

1416
02:15:35,000 --> 02:15:39,000
Remember what a scene I created...

1417
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:41,000
when I came to your place
one night?

1418
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:43,000
I said, "You must rehearse with me"

1419
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:52,000
You should've been there, when the
audience applauded that scene today.

1420
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:54,000
The film has its premiere
the day after tomorrow.

1421
02:15:54,000 --> 02:16:00,000
I want us both to
watch the film together.

1422
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:09,000
Never have I awaited anything as
eagerly as I await this day, Munna.

1423
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:12,000
A dream I dreamt
as a child...

1424
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:15,000
will now be fulfilled.

1425
02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:20,000
And it has happened
thanks to Kamalji.

1426
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:25,000
Without Kamalji, I wouldn't
have been able to do anything.

1427
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:28,000
I don't know how I'd manage.

1428
02:16:28,000 --> 02:17:13,000
I wouldn't have
achieved so much.

1429
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:14,000
Welcome...

1430
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:15,000
You're so late!

1431
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:18,000
I didn't know what to wear!

1432
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:22,000
She took so much time, I thought
we'd reach for the silver jubilee.

1433
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:25,000
Where's Munna?
- He's not coming.

1434
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:27,000
He has sent this letter.
- What letter?

1435
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:30,000
How'd I know? Read it for yourself.
- But where is he?

1436
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:33,000
I don't know. But he
behaved very strangely.

1437
02:17:33,000 --> 02:17:37,000
He must be somewhere. Let's go.
- Yes. We'll see about him later.

1438
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:41,000
Funny chap. What's the fuss for?
- What happened?

1439
02:17:41,000 --> 02:19:36,000
Nothing.

1440
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:42,000
You have been watching a colorful
evening..."Rangeela" (colorful one).

1441
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:45,000
Are you happy?
- Very much!

1442
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:48,000
I want to tell you something
after the function is over.

1443
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:49,000
What is it?

1444
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:51,000
After the function.

1445
02:19:51,000 --> 02:20:02,000
Tell me!
- After the function.

1446
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:04,000
"I'm leaving Mili"

1447
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:08,000
"There's something I always
wanted to tell you"

1448
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:12,000
"I love you very much"

1449
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:16,000
"But I have come to
realize something today"

1450
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:18,000
"You aren't made for me"

1451
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:23,000
"I'm too small a man. And you
belong to the world of the rich"

1452
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:28,000
"It's someone like Kamal
that you should marry"

1453
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:31,000
"What Kamal can give you..."

1454
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:35,000
"I will never be able to"

1455
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:40,000
"But I can't bear to see you
with someone else, Mili"

1456
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:43,000
"I don't possess such a big heart"

1457
02:20:43,000 --> 02:20:49,000
"And so I'm leaving this town.
Forever"

1458
02:20:49,000 --> 02:20:56,000
"You must think I'm talking
nonsense at a time like this"

1459
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:58,000
"But, Mili..."

1460
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:05,000
"I had to tell you how I felt"

1461
02:21:05,000 --> 02:21:09,000
"Forgive me, if I have
done something wrong"

1462
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:11,000
"I'm leaving"

1463
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:33,000
"Good bye"

1464
02:21:33,000 --> 02:21:55,000
What's up?

1465
02:21:55,000 --> 02:21:59,000
Get the car, Kamalji!
I've got to go!

1466
02:21:59,000 --> 02:22:02,000
I must go immediately!
Get the car!

1467
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:07,000
What's happened...?

1468
02:22:07,000 --> 02:22:10,000
Munna has gone away.

1469
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:12,000
Munna who?

1470
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:15,000
Munna! You know him, don't you?

1471
02:22:15,000 --> 02:22:20,000
He has left.

1472
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:22,000
Did you leave the show
for something so little?

1473
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:25,000
You don't understand, Kamal.

1474
02:22:25,000 --> 02:22:28,000
Do you know what he thinks?

1475
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:30,000
He's so crazy!

1476
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:33,000
I don't know how he got
this notion that...

1477
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:36,000
that the two of us
have fallen in love...

1478
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:38,000
and that we're going
to get married.

1479
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:40,000
He's such a fool!

1480
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:41,000
He's leaving town.

1481
02:22:41,000 --> 02:22:44,000
He writes that he loves me.

1482
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:47,000
As if I'm not worried
about him at all.

1483
02:22:47,000 --> 02:22:49,000
I love him, too.

1484
02:22:49,000 --> 02:22:54,000
But that doesn't mean you walk out
on the one you love.

1485
02:22:54,000 --> 02:23:17,000
Where will I look for him?
Oh where?!

1486
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:21,000
Where's Munna?

1487
02:23:21,000 --> 02:23:25,000
He has left.
- Left? Where has he gone?

1488
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:28,000
Why do you want to know?
- Don't act funny, Pakya.

1489
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:32,000
Stop acting filmi with me!

1490
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:35,000
Do you know the things
he did for you?

1491
02:23:35,000 --> 02:23:38,000
With every penny he had saved,
he bought a gift...

1492
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:41,000
and went to Goa to meet you.
But gifts mean nothing to you!

1493
02:23:41,000 --> 02:23:43,000
He went to see your film.

1494
02:23:43,000 --> 02:23:46,000
He asked me to join him.

1495
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:49,000
And you insulted him
in front of everyone!

1496
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:51,000
Why?

1497
02:23:51,000 --> 02:23:55,000
Because you wanted to become
a big film star!

1498
02:23:55,000 --> 02:24:02,000
And here... on these pavements,
he spent nights dreaming of you.

1499
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:05,000
He kept me awake till
2 and 3 a.m. Every night.

1500
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:10,000
Why?
To talk to me about you!

1501
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:14,000
All the money he had
saved for his marriage...

1502
02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:17,000
he has given me
before leaving.

1503
02:24:17,000 --> 02:24:24,000
He said, "Use the money
for your marriage, Pakya"

1504
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:26,000
Damn it!

1505
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:31,000
I've begun to hate love and
marriage after knowing about you!

1506
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:39,000
Go away, Mili.

1507
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:42,000
We can discuss all
these things later, Pakya.

1508
02:24:42,000 --> 02:25:04,000
First tell us where Munna is.

1509
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:08,000
Munna!

1510
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:09,000
Mili? You?!

1511
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:12,000
Where are you going?

1512
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:19,000
What's all this about?

1513
02:25:19,000 --> 02:25:24,000
Now look, Mili. I wrote whatever
I had to say to you.

1514
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:26,000
And what did you write?
- I can understand, Mili.

1515
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:28,000
I understand everything.

1516
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:32,000
I don't want to be an obstacle.
I don't want to create a scene.

1517
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:34,000
Be happy, the two of you.

1518
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:37,000
I just want to see you happy, Mili.
I swear!

1519
02:25:37,000 --> 02:25:41,000
Munna!
What misunderstanding is this?

1520
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:44,000
What made you think that I'm in
love with her and want to marry her?

1521
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:46,000
How could you imagine
such things?

1522
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:50,000
We're actors, after all.
We spend time working together.

1523
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:52,000
That doesn't mean we'll
spend our lives together.

1524
02:25:52,000 --> 02:26:00,000
She left the premiere of her first
film to look for you all night.

1525
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:05,000
Mili loves you very much.
I swear.

1526
02:26:05,000 --> 02:26:11,000
That's what she herself told me.

1527
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:38,000
She's angry. Watch out, buddy.

1528
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:41,000
How'd I know you're in...

1529
02:26:41,000 --> 02:26:44,000
Not another word.
Or you're going to get a thrashing!

1530
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:47,000
You didn't tell me when you had to.
And you're saying it now!

1531
02:26:47,000 --> 02:26:49,000
You could have said it too.
- Sure, I could.

1532
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:51,000
Did you want me to scream
from rooftops that...

1533
02:26:51,000 --> 02:26:53,000
Why are you screaming now?
- Shut up!

1534
02:26:53,000 --> 02:26:56,000
Or I'll give you a pasting!
- Don't touch me, I warn you.

1535
02:26:56,000 --> 02:26:59,000
And you won't touch me either!

1536
02:26:59,000 --> 02:27:01,000
What are you going to do?
What...?

1537
02:27:01,000 --> 02:27:04,000
This is why I didn't tell you.
- So don't tell me!

1538
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:08,000
You will run away from me, will you?
Who do you think you are?

1539
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:12,000
Where will you go?
- I said sorry, haven't I?

1540
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:17,000
Don't hit me...
I said sorry.

1541
02:27:17,000 --> 02:27:19,000
Where will you go...?

1542
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:30,000
