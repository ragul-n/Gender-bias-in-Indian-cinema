00:21:39,804 --> 00:21:41,031
Where do your parents stay?

179
00:21:46,618 --> 00:21:48,985
Come to the ground tomorrow morning.
With running shoes...

180
00:22:00,066 --> 00:22:02,137
Hey, why did you take this road?

181
00:22:02,553 --> 00:22:05,522
-We have to head that way.
-Hanuman Festival is going on, sir.

182
00:22:05,729 --> 00:22:06,947
That road was blocked.

183
00:22:07,132 --> 00:22:09,554
There are people everywhere
around that statue, sir.

184
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:13,958
God, I'll never understand
these brainless people.

185
00:22:14,979 --> 00:22:16,995
Praying for Hanuman at home will
do, right?

186
00:22:18,527 --> 00:22:20,269
Why should they create all this mess?

187
00:22:22,165 --> 00:22:25,478
The one thing that keeps humans
going is not just fear of God, sir...

188
00:22:26,733 --> 00:22:27,929
It's the bravery he lends us!

189
00:22:28,996 --> 00:22:32,871
Not many can understand that
God is someone bigger than us...

190
00:22:34,201 --> 00:22:35,912
But a statue will prove that point.

191
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:40,819
The minute they lay their eyes
on such a huge statue of God...

192
00:22:42,347 --> 00:22:44,464
It will remind them of his greatness...

193
00:22:45,893 --> 00:22:47,682
And also fill them with strength.

194
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,572
And that strength keeps them
going, sir.

195
00:22:55,997 --> 00:23:00,856
That's why millions of people
visit that statue every year.

196
00:23:21,868 --> 00:23:23,672
Do we need this statue now?

197
00:23:24,999 --> 00:23:27,499
Not just a 'need'... It's a 'must'!

198
00:23:28,723 --> 00:23:33,004
For my father's name to be written in
rock... This has to be done at any cost.

199
00:23:33,854 --> 00:23:36,189
But this is too big a decision
to take at this point.

200
00:23:36,628 --> 00:23:40,394
Why don't we introduce some
special packages under his name?

201
00:23:40,568 --> 00:23:43,154
Like groceries for just 10 rupees.

202
00:23:43,254 --> 00:23:46,589
Paying all their hospital
bills at times...

203
00:23:46,782 --> 00:23:50,001
Because packages like these
will never go out of style.

204
00:23:51,624 --> 00:23:55,234
Next government will get them down to 5
rupees and name them after their leaders.

205
00:23:55,916 --> 00:23:56,986
What can we do then?

206
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:03,514
Let's name a railway station or
an airport after your father.

207
00:24:08,114 --> 00:24:10,458
You have been here
even before I was born.

208
00:24:10,944 --> 00:24:14,131
You should have known how many times
our Hyderabad airport changed names.

209
00:24:15,065 --> 00:24:17,588
I am telling you as I am here
even before you are born...

210
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:22,435
If we can manage to spend 10% of
that amount during the campaigning...

211
00:24:23,052 --> 00:24:25,818
We will win the elections
with the highest majority.

212
00:24:26,611 --> 00:24:30,196
Liquor and money will buy a single
vote during a single election.

213
00:24:30,833 --> 00:24:33,208
But the image that
their leader is a God...

214
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:35,409
It will work in every other election.

215
00:24:35,878 --> 00:24:39,370
That is why I have decided
to make my dad a God!

216
00:24:40,139 --> 00:24:41,389
What if you do?

217
00:24:43,786 --> 00:24:45,294
If my dad is a God...

218
00:24:45,789 --> 00:24:47,617
What will his son be?

219
00:24:50,374 --> 00:24:51,632
Got it...

220
00:24:54,556 --> 00:24:58,009
But will they believe him as a
God, with just a statue?

221
00:25:00,475 --> 00:25:02,366
Not just any statue, uncle.

222
00:25:02,594 --> 00:25:04,930
A statue that makes
even the Gods jealous.

223
00:25:05,767 --> 00:25:07,392
The public are just fools, uncle.

224
00:25:08,441 --> 00:25:10,613
One who praises them
are great humans!

225
00:25:10,824 --> 00:25:12,379
And who's no more are stars and Gods!

226
00:25:12,947 --> 00:25:15,916
Why do we have a Hanuman statue
at the border of every village?

227
00:25:16,277 --> 00:25:18,246
To fill the village with bravery.

228
00:25:18,678 --> 00:25:22,061
This statue will do
the same for our party.

229
00:25:22,542 --> 00:25:26,261
Even the opposition members will
look at him, standing tall!

230
00:25:28,168 --> 00:25:31,191
The next generations of students will
read this in their textbooks.

231
00:25:33,049 --> 00:25:34,205
That is why...

232
00:25:34,953 --> 00:25:39,031
I have decided to build my dad a
statue, that no history had ever seen.

233
00:25:41,983 --> 00:25:44,171
Keep a proposal for funds
with the high command.

234
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:05,531
Are you going to teach
them at least today?

235
00:26:05,905 --> 00:26:08,093
As if there is a deadline for that!

236
00:26:09,912 --> 00:26:11,005
Enough!

237
00:26:12,975 --> 00:26:16,646
Tell me... What you all aspire to be?

238
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:18,395
I'll be a SI (Sub-inspector).

239
00:26:18,826 --> 00:26:19,990
I'll be a movie star.

240
00:26:23,041 --> 00:26:24,244
Next...

241
00:26:25,807 --> 00:26:27,643
I'll be a scientist.

242
00:26:27,678 --> 00:26:31,553
I'll stop the water from
taking any more lives.

243
00:26:31,578 --> 00:26:36,595
I'll find a way to cleanse the
water that took my father away.

244
00:26:46,495 --> 00:26:47,613
Very good!

245
00:26:49,061 --> 00:26:51,499
From tomorrow onwards,
come to class on time.

246
00:26:52,258 --> 00:26:54,091
I'll teach you Science.

247
00:26:54,116 --> 00:26:55,444
[all]: OK, sir.

248
00:26:56,176 --> 00:26:59,700
That's all for today.
You can go play now. Go.

249
00:27:44,184 --> 00:27:46,442
Hey, Chinni fell unconscious.

250
00:27:52,264 --> 00:27:53,990
-Nurse...
-Sir...

251
00:27:55,557 --> 00:27:57,456
-Take the girl away.
-OK, sir.

252
00:28:00,837 --> 00:28:01,938
Slowly!

253
00:28:06,078 --> 00:28:08,367
Sir... My girl...

254
00:28:09,459 --> 00:28:11,646
What's there to ask? It's obvious!

255
00:28:12,803 --> 00:28:14,100
What's obvious, sir?

256
00:28:14,866 --> 00:28:17,710
Your husband had it...
The entire village has it...

257
00:28:18,163 --> 00:28:20,304
The great Uddanam kidney problem!

258
00:28:21,871 --> 00:28:23,636
Sir, what should I do now?

259
00:28:25,405 --> 00:28:27,249
I feel pity for your innocence.

260
00:28:28,506 --> 00:28:30,748
What we do for all those who
get affected... Dialysis.

261
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:36,068
It means, pumping out her blood,
cleaning it and injecting it back.

262
00:28:37,278 --> 00:28:41,364
You filled your blood with this poisonous
water, right? It has to be cleaned.

263
00:28:44,876 --> 00:28:47,603
Hey, why did you take my father away?

264
00:28:47,952 --> 00:28:50,061
Who will take me to school now?

265
00:28:50,167 --> 00:28:52,862
Who will buy me my favourite biscuits?

266
00:28:53,887 --> 00:28:56,669
Who will take my mom to the hospital?

267
00:28:56,694 --> 00:29:00,981
As if everything on this beach is yours...
How can you take away all of it?

268
00:29:04,149 --> 00:29:06,547
I won't let you take anyone else!

269
00:29:06,826 --> 00:29:08,186
I'll thrash you...

270
00:29:21,558 --> 00:29:25,644
Terrestrial organisms take-up
oxygen from the atmosphere...

271
00:29:25,784 --> 00:29:27,659
Whereas aquatic animals...

272
00:29:28,417 --> 00:29:29,777
Stop staring like that!

273
00:29:30,664 --> 00:29:32,812
Hit puberty fast and give me some rest.

274
00:29:33,242 --> 00:29:36,015
My body can't take this anymore.
Come on...

275
00:29:44,815 --> 00:29:46,330
What... Is this your first time?

276
00:29:46,355 --> 00:29:47,418
[continues to read]

277
00:29:48,527 --> 00:29:50,066
Take off your clothes...

278
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,129
Make it fast.

279
00:29:54,843 --> 00:29:56,054
Yeah.

280
00:29:56,843 --> 00:29:57,999
Faster!

281
00:30:15,734 --> 00:30:19,367
People think you are so beautiful
and even write poetry on you...

282
00:30:19,992 --> 00:30:22,524
I am sure they have never seen Jyothi.

283
00:30:23,286 --> 00:30:25,231
If they did,
they will never come back to you.

284
00:30:25,912 --> 00:30:29,170
I don't like people
gawking at me all the time.

285
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:33,522
I don't know when my mom
will understand my pain!

286
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:38,170
She thinks I have to be
working, just like her.

287
00:30:39,534 --> 00:30:40,721
I don't want this life.

288
00:30:42,121 --> 00:30:45,581
I want to live in a new
and a beautiful world.

289
00:30:47,483 --> 00:30:48,975
But whom should I ask?

290
00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:51,225
Tell her to ask me, just for once...

291
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:54,502
At least ask her to look at me.

292
00:30:55,348 --> 00:30:57,621
I'll lay my entire life at her feet.

293
00:30:58,210 --> 00:31:01,398
I want to run as far as
possible from this world.

294
00:31:01,914 --> 00:31:03,383
Let her ask me...

295
00:31:04,175 --> 00:31:06,144
And I'll take her to the
edges of this universe.

296
00:31:07,245 --> 00:31:10,901
What if my mom never gets to
know, even when I really hit puberty?

297
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:12,401
Such a great idea!

298
00:31:13,186 --> 00:31:15,952
Me... And my Jyothi next to me.

299
00:31:17,664 --> 00:31:20,351
Forever... Just we both...

300
00:31:22,546 --> 00:31:23,835
When is it going to happen?

301
00:31:24,008 --> 00:31:25,539
♪

302
00:33:09,118 --> 00:33:10,993
-Good morning, sir.
-Morning.

303
00:33:16,563 --> 00:33:17,735
See Mr. Bose...

304
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:22,060
Do you know what you have to do,
to make things move in this country?

305
00:33:24,191 --> 00:33:28,347
You want something to happen.
Means... You have a need.

306
00:33:28,952 --> 00:33:31,366
The one who works for
it will also have needs.

307
00:33:31,671 --> 00:33:36,139
Only when you can meet his
needs, your needs will be met.

308
00:33:36,795 --> 00:33:39,514
No no, mine is not a need, sir.

309
00:33:40,392 --> 00:33:42,197
It's about the lives of 100 kids.

310
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:44,328
I have been trying for 7 years.

311
00:33:44,762 --> 00:33:48,098
You are not releasing the funds
sanctioned for hostel restoration.

312
00:33:48,567 --> 00:33:51,434
The rainwater is dripping in.

313
00:33:51,869 --> 00:33:53,846
The kids are not being able to sleep well.

314
00:33:54,472 --> 00:33:57,902
It seems that you haven't
understood what I said.

315
00:33:58,096 --> 00:34:03,135
It's our need to do all this
on the name of our leader.

316
00:34:03,296 --> 00:34:06,203
But you named your hostel 'Bose'.

317
00:34:08,319 --> 00:34:12,342
Sir, tell me clearly,
what do you want to convey?

318
00:34:12,739 --> 00:34:17,138
Simple! Name your hostel after our
leader and the funds will follow.

319
00:34:30,498 --> 00:34:33,147
It's not as easy as changing the name...

320
00:34:34,488 --> 00:34:36,081
To change oneself!

321
00:34:38,661 --> 00:34:39,989
Remember that.

322
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:03,282
Grandpa!

323
00:35:05,905 --> 00:35:06,968
Sit down, master...

324
00:35:11,702 --> 00:35:13,202
Drink some water, uncle.

325
00:35:14,774 --> 00:35:18,289
Maybe I shouldn't say so,
but do you need all this?

326
00:35:19,407 --> 00:35:20,470
Listen...

327
00:35:21,455 --> 00:35:24,393
The kids are unable to sleep at night...

328
00:35:25,378 --> 00:35:28,418
Without proper sleep and proper food...

329
00:35:29,269 --> 00:35:31,214
How can they concentrate at school?

330
00:35:31,837 --> 00:35:32,837
That's why...

331
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:36,483
-I have decided to... Damn!
-Your student is here...

332
00:35:37,607 --> 00:35:40,139
-Rajesh... Come on!
-Grandpa...

333
00:35:41,288 --> 00:35:43,546
-Sit down.
-What happened? Why do you look hurt?

334
00:35:43,657 --> 00:35:45,071
It's nothing.

335
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,443
-How are you?
-I am good.

336
00:35:46,468 --> 00:35:47,982
-How's your health?
-Fine...

337
00:35:48,007 --> 00:35:50,734
-What about studies...
-God, he's talking about studies now...

338
00:35:50,852 --> 00:35:52,867
Now he'll make us sing 'Jana Gana Mana'.
Let's run!

339
00:35:52,892 --> 00:35:54,165
-Hey!
-Run!

340
00:35:56,801 --> 00:35:58,020
Look at them run!

341
00:36:00,183 --> 00:36:01,644
-Rajesh...
-Tell me, grandpa.

342
00:36:02,714 --> 00:36:07,250
You are the first among us,
to get a higher education.

343
00:36:08,493 --> 00:36:10,751
I feel so proud of you.

344
00:36:11,199 --> 00:36:12,793
Very proud!

345
00:36:14,482 --> 00:36:15,740
You...

346
00:36:18,768 --> 00:36:20,017
-Listen...
-Tell me, grandpa.

347
00:36:20,934 --> 00:36:24,551
One day... When I am no more...

348
00:36:26,678 --> 00:36:29,623
-Will you take care of these kids?
-Of course!

349
00:36:29,648 --> 00:36:30,935

01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:32,953
You can't even feel happy about the crop.
Oh, God!

701
01:10:33,531 --> 01:10:36,468
OK... Here is 20 grand...

702
01:10:37,351 --> 01:10:39,633
-The entire crop is mine.
-OK, sir.

703
01:10:39,721 --> 01:10:43,166
I'll pay you the remaining,
only after the harvest. OK?

704
01:10:43,366 --> 01:10:44,983
-OK, sir.
-Here you go.

705
01:10:46,586 --> 01:10:49,445
-Thank you so much, sir.
-Girl, study well.

706
01:10:49,876 --> 01:10:50,986
Bye.

707
01:11:01,941 --> 01:11:04,910
See... Grandpa paid us.

708
01:11:04,935 --> 01:11:07,503
Shall we go get some medicine for you?

709
01:11:20,491 --> 01:11:24,061
The preliminary estimation
is 30 million, sir.

710
01:11:24,592 --> 01:11:26,842
What? 30 million!

711
01:11:27,144 --> 01:11:30,355
Our state already has 30k crores of debt.

712
01:11:31,054 --> 01:11:34,155
It's impossible to get such
amount of money right now.

713
01:11:34,936 --> 01:11:37,686
We have recently released our
budget, right? That's money too.

714
01:11:38,018 --> 01:11:40,885
Even that budget was
based on more debts.

715
01:11:41,704 --> 01:11:45,173
We can't make ourselves a golden
crown out of debt money, right?

716
01:11:46,410 --> 01:11:50,246
If we make cuts on daily
supplies, the state will burn.

717
01:11:51,946 --> 01:11:53,875
I think you are not following me at all.

718
01:11:54,963 --> 01:11:56,588
We are not making any cuts there.

719
01:11:58,836 --> 01:12:02,735
Let's say our agenda is to feed
a hungry man until he's full.

720
01:12:03,383 --> 01:12:05,172
What if we don't feed him at all?

721
01:12:05,403 --> 01:12:08,590
He'll scream at the government,
unable to take hunger.

722
01:12:09,457 --> 01:12:13,324
But if we feed him half the amount,
he'll adjust with what he gets.

723
01:12:13,816 --> 01:12:15,050
He'll never fight back.

724
01:12:15,417 --> 01:12:16,652
The theory sounds good.

725
01:12:17,418 --> 01:12:18,824
But how can we implement this?

726
01:12:21,228 --> 01:12:23,634
Let's say I know my father
has 100 bucks in his pocket.

727
01:12:24,758 --> 01:12:26,219
If I take it directly...

728
01:12:26,752 --> 01:12:28,072
I'll get caught.

729
01:12:28,328 --> 01:12:30,172
So my plan is that...

730
01:12:30,897 --> 01:12:33,749
I'll take 20 bucks from dad.
20 more from mom.

731
01:12:34,295 --> 01:12:36,951
20 from the worship room
and 20 from my grandpa.

732
01:12:37,260 --> 01:12:41,949
I'll get to the mark of my 100,
taking amounts of 20 from many places.

733
01:12:42,329 --> 01:12:45,109
Even they won't question me back,
as it's just 20 bucks out of 100.

734
01:12:48,056 --> 01:12:49,689
So what shall we do now?

735
01:12:50,550 --> 01:12:52,331
We are not cutting off the entire funds.

736
01:12:53,087 --> 01:12:54,330
We are just making little cuts.

737
01:12:54,815 --> 01:12:57,190
Just - little - cuts!

738
01:12:59,328 --> 01:13:02,781
They'll question us if we don't help
them at all. Not when we do give some.

739
01:13:03,217 --> 01:13:06,171
The middle class will
never think out of the box.
