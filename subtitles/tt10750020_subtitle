00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:37,220
Title: PATTAS 
(FIREWORKS)

2
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:48,430
(Neyyattinkara Sub jail)

3
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:01,230
Don’t presume her to be like other woman

4
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,440
She has mastered the art of Adimurai 
( ancient Tamil martial art)

5
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:06,020
She has pierced the throat of the 
foreigner who killed her child

6
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:07,320
Sakthi

7
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:08,320
Sakthi

8
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:09,530
Leave me

9
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:11,390
I hate that laugh

10
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:12,580
Sakthi

11
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:18,130
Wake up Sakthi

12
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:22,790
Sakthi!

13
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:35,410
Sakthi

14
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:36,920
Sakthi

15
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:40,970
He broke my leg

16
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:23,650
The new sun has come into my house

17
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:28,820
It plays beautifully

18
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:34,310
The shoulders are loaded with joy

19
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:39,790
When I lift you, 
my hunger vanishes

20
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:45,960
You are the shadow near me 
that will bloom to the dawn

21
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:48,590
You are the one who spreads through the sky

22
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:51,570
You are the abundant beauty that glows

23
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,010
Come dear the best language

24
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,080
The path that the flowers have opened

25
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,520
I am the broken statue

26
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:02,210
You are the life that blossomed from it

27
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:07,790
Can the water go away from the sea

28
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:13,320
Can the fish live on the shore

29
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:19,360
Every second as I think of you, 
my heart melts

30
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:24,840
This small face in its purity, 
wipes out all the pain that I endured

31
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:30,320
To cherish you again in my lap, 
my womb is in penance

32
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:36,000
To lead a life without you; 
where do I commence ?

33
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:41,420
You are the only reason 
for my existence

34
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:47,280
Will the sun ever vanish away from the sky?

35
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:52,490
Is there a purest form of love 
better than a mother's love?

36
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:57,400
Rest your head 
to this lullaby

37
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:03,240
Close your eyes 
to this lullaby

38
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:08,460
Rest your head 
to this lullaby

39
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:14,810
Close your eyes 
to this lullaby

40
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:23,330
In Bangkok

41
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:28,880
This is the finals for the 
eight year of the MMA match

42
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:31,930
MMA is mixed martial art

43
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:36,010
It’s a game where within a 
cage people fight and win

44
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:39,240
Anyone who knows martial 
arts can participate

45
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:42,870
The rules and regulations 
for this is special

46
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:45,290
Amongst the games which are money spinners

47
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:50,460
This game occupies a 
very prominent spot MMA

48
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:56,390
Richard is going to win the finals 
for the fourth consecutive time

49
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:58,790
He's too ferocious in the fight

50
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,560
Whoa! Adam is knocked down

51
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,620
Richard won the match

52
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:10,020
The success formula behind Richard 
is the person who leads him

53
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:14,480
His father, his coach and former 
kickboxing champion Nilan

54
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:21,510
I am very happy to announce that

55
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:29,930
MR Nilan is going to be 
our contact in India

56
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:33,340
The place will be Chennai

57
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:38,450
I have being waiting for 
this moment for many years

58
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:39,670
I am very happy

59
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:42,030
How come your son is the 
champion for all these years

60
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:44,370
Isn’t there anyone else in India ?

61
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:48,050
I guess, there is no one in India 
who is as talented as my son

62
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:50,330
Bro!

63
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:52,250
Show your strength Bro

64
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:57,790
Punch it on right

65
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,090
87

66
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:02,910
Punch on the left

67
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:05,070
30...40...80...

68
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:07,800
87...It shows the same power 
on both hands for you

69
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:09,080
I think the machine is faulty

70
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,250
Did we come here to check this?

71
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:12,380
Come let’s get to work

72
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:17,340
(Thambaram thailaya kuppi 
Kathi para kappi)

73
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,940
Don’t you know when we are at work 
you should turn your phone off

74
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,700
Sorry bro. Forgot to 
put it on silent mode

75
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,010
It’s our guy, let me check what he wants

76
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:25,900
- Tell me bro! 
- Dear!

77
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:27,320
Can you please renew my internet

78
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:30,370
As you are in jail, I took 
pity and recharged it for you

79
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:32,310
First stop sharing your 
hotspot to these attendants

80
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:34,460
What to do! Instead of money 
they want internet

81
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,560
Next month I will come out

82
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:36,590
Then you come and do it

83
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:37,830
Dear! Listen, Puncture!

84
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,060
Which is your best 
moment in India?

85
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:41,620
My first championship cup

86
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:45,030
It’s always a special moment for me

87
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:49,470
And it has a special place in my 
heart and my academy in Chennai

88
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:52,960
Why this one is treated special 
and kept in a glass box

89
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:00,090
I think it’s silver

90
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:01,520
We can pawn this

91
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:02,250
Nonsense

92
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:05,030
If it was silver he would have pawned it

93
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,230
It’s rusted

94
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:09,870
Then we will wash this well 
and use it for our restroom

95
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,260
It’s very stressful without a mug

96
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:13,250
Is it!

97
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:15,890
Then pack everything

98
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:24,540
Tik tok freak

99
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,380
Hey Alexa! Play the 
song for funeral dance

100
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,040
See who I am!

101
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:41,560
She’s clueless what’s happening around her! 
Look at her dance

102
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,860
Give the phone

103
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:55,250
Hello

104
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,770
Sir I am from the police

105
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,620
It’s at your academy 
that there’s a break in

106
00:08:58,700 --> 00:08:59,200
What?

107
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:00,950
Theft at the academy ?

108
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:03,650
- Tell him I am not here 
- No, you're not the thief

109
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,890
- Don’t tell them I am here 
- Did we steal together

110
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,460
Hello

111
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:08,450
Your daughter is asking me not to tell you

112
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:09,990
My daughter ?

113
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,560
Sadhana is your 
daughter isn’t it ?

114
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:14,440
She’s my staff. Give her the phone

115
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:16,840
Staff?

116
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:18,480
Doofus!

117
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,380
But you were showing 
off like the owner!

118
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:22,130
Hello

119
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:23,270
Why did I leave you behind?

120
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,670
What were you doing until 
everything was stolen?

121
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:25,670
What's with the long face?

122
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,370
Sir...That..

123
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:29,460
Sorry sir

124
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,660
Go. Show them the CCTV footage

125
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:35,680
They first targeted the CCTV

126
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,680
Show them the hard disc.Should 
I tell you everything

127
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:42,800
Not just the hard disc, they 
did not spare even the cable

128
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:44,800
But the thieves who came are really dumb

129
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:46,330
They didn’t take the cash from the office

130
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:49,370
They just took away all 
these old cups and shields

131
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,170
Idiot! Senseless!

132
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,850
Do you know the value of that cup?

133
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:55,320
Worthless tin!

134
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:57,310
It won’t even total to RS 350

135
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,310
What’s the pride in gathering all this ?

136
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:02,450
Hey we took this for something else. 
Give me whatever you can

137
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:04,040
Else you will shower in lakhs

138
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:06,170
We are now millionaires

139
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:08,320
- Like I'll believe that! 
- What are you blabbering?

140
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:11,440
Sorry bro! Without your 
knowledge I swindled a big sum

141
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,720
When? Where?

142
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:16,550
He's useless

143
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:19,420
Separate them

144
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:20,760
Yes, come in

145
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,340
What’s this?

146
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:25,290
It’s a cheque for five lakhs

147
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:27,610
They have signed it and left it there

148
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:28,880
That’s why I just took it

149
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:30,830
On the way here I spoke to the manager

150
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:33,040
It will be shared in 70:30 ratio

151
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,440
Did I show you my worth?

152
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:36,050
It’s invalid

153
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:37,320
Invalid?

154
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:38,440
It’s invalid

155
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:42,030
Then why on earth do 10 people give this 
after they play and pose for photographs

156
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,220
That’s a dummy given for advertising

157
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:45,180
It’s invalid

158
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:48,210
- Are you sure? 
- Will they give such a big cheque

159
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:51,100
As the value is big I assumed 
the cheque will also be big

160
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:53,220
Shall I tell this out

161
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:56,060
- No 
- No need?

162
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,030
Can we leave?

163
00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:58,560
We will take it with us

164
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,130
It’s smooth and can be used to sleep on

165
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:03,020
Whatever!

166
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:04,960
It’s really shameful

167
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:07,310
Babu, find out who is behind this soon

168
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:09,200
- The inspector is here 
- Catch the thief before I reach!

169
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:10,020
I will take care

170
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:12,110
Sir

171
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,220
Don’t worry, they will be 
near the dump yard area

172
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:17,920
- We will catch them 
- Impossible, sir!

173
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:18,820
Sir

174
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:23,210
- It’s the work of audio thief 
- Audio thief? Who are they?

175
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:25,740
They are doing theft from 1990s

176
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:29,050
They will acknowledge the theft and leave 
behind a gift for the house members

177
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,090
We have taken 25 sovereigns 
of gold from your house

178
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:36,540
As a token of our appreciation 
we are leaving this nosepin

179
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:42,470
As you enjoyed the circus, 
we swindled everything

180
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:48,070
For the children to celebrate we are 
leaving this gift pack of fireworks

181
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:49,250
Happy Diwali!

182
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:52,560
We came in search of you and took 
away all the wealth from your house

183
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:59,250
In view of the upcoming festivals, 
here’s the pot to celebrate this pongal

184
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:00,630
Wonder what they left for us?

185
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,480
He has left dates for us

186
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:04,000
- Seed-less? 
- What should we do?

187
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,620
He'll tell us

188
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:06,170
Sir

189
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,090
Let’s take one each

190
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,280
Don’t touch!

191
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,120
- Fingerprints 
- Genius!

192
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:13,400
You can't nab them even 
with their footprints

193
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,810
They are not the one 
with the mind to theft

194
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,970
Theft is their mind

195
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:19,450
They are the incredibles!

196
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:57,050
I am area boy 
I am a naughty boy

197
00:12:57,130 --> 00:13:00,460
Without any qualms 
I am man of the mass

198
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:03,060
I am filled with love 
I am filled with glee

199
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,160
Without money 
I am still happy

200
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:10,990
Don’t try to show off with me

201
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:13,610
You will be gone before you can think

202
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,750
We will be hand in glove

203
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:18,460
And celebrate our friendship

204
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,030

Bro, chill bro

214
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,570
The fuel price has shot up

215
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:30,380
As we don’t have the car, 
it’s no problem

216
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:33,540
In chennai there’s no water

217
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:36,580
I don’t take a bath, 
so it’s no problem

218
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:39,600
I won’t think about tomorrow

219
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:42,650
When it’s a secret I won’t open my mouth

220
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:45,480
Those who trust me will never be let down

221
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:48,510
Those you ditch me 
I won’t take it to heart

222
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:52,980
Don’t try to show off with me

223
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:55,960
You will be gone before you can think

224
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:58,940
We will be hand in glove

225
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,500

I am telling you not to scream

245
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:19,120
Shut up

246
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:23,850
Gosh! So, you're finally 
getting released?

247
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,110
At least now be sensible

248
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:26,900
Keep it here

249
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,810
At least now, after getting out 
from here, live a decent life

250
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:32,110
- She’s an arrogant lady! 
- Go, mind your business

251
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:36,760
Go Kanya! Finish him off!

252
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:38,450
Have you checked her things properly

253
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:39,090
Yes ma'am

254
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:40,550
- Give it to her 
- Okay, ma'am

255
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:43,380
You could have 
easily shortened it

256
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:47,130
Unnecessarily you tried 
to escape 4 times and...

257
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,270
extended this to 16 years

258
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:51,600
Sign here

259
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:54,420
Your PCP account is closed

260
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,850
The salary that you worked 
for is RS 4.60 lakhs

261
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:58,730
Your bag

262
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:03,120
After you go out, control your anger. 
Calm down

263
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,120
Will come back

264
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:08,940
Never say that when you leave 
the jail or a place of death

265
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:09,960
Leave now

266
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:11,970
I will come back

267
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:19,120
I think the cops have sniffed us

268
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:21,060
Just pretend as if you know nothing!

269
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:22,190
Those two sir

270
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,300
How come!

271
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:24,690
I know sir

272
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:25,500
Hey!

273
00:17:25,570 --> 00:17:27,250
- Told you, don't mind them! You pothead! 
- We?

274
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:27,830
Come here

275
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:29,800
They are calling us bro

276
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,650
Bro! My stomach is churning 
Can I go home and come?

277
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,540
- Shut up and come 
- That’s a great idea bro

278
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:37,180
Sir

279
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:39,430
I heard about the two 
of you in this area

280
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,320
Do you know about the audio thief

281
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:43,550
The cassette companies 
have shut down ages ago

282
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,950
Now it’s only about memory card

283
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,660
I will tell them

284
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:48,270
Audio thieves are those 
who steal from a house

285
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:51,450
After that they sarcastically leave 
behind cash for the house expenses

286
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:52,790
- Ever heard of them? 
- I don’t know

287
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:53,740
They don’t know sir

288
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:55,080
I am listening

289
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:56,760
Will you do some work?

290
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:57,960
It depends on the work

291
00:17:58,890 --> 00:17:59,710
- Yeah 
- Yes

292
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,810
In this area if someone is loaded 
with money and spends it unreasonably

293
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:03,760
You should inform us

294
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:06,480
From today you both 
are police informers

295
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:07,730
- Okay 
- Sir

296
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:09,500
Thanks for giving us a Police job

297
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:14,330
For your physique you 
want a police job

298
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:15,680
He’s looking at me!

299
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,760
Why, aren’t you doing?

300
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:19,130
- Sorry sir 
- Salute sir

301
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:20,410
- Be sincere while on duty! 
- Yes sir!

302
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:38,100
Follow them

303
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:51,040
What are you doing?

304
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:52,020
What do you want?

305
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:54,560
Look, two guys are peeing 
from your compound wall!

306
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:56,410
- Peeing? 
- Yes. See there

307
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:57,750
Look at them both spraying all over!

308
00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:00,320
- These fellows are trouble! 
- They are facing the camera and doing it

309
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:01,140
Hey, who's that?

310
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:03,220
He’s so dumb

311
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,040
Guard, no hurry. Take your time

312
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:10,210
Bro, this way

313
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:13,080
Here is the MMA agreement copy

314
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,510
Greetings master

315
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:15,700
Come Vicky

316
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:17,990
Your daughter?

317
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:19,490
Yes master

318
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,400
- What’s your name? 
- Mahirani

319
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:23,570
Very nice name, 
what will you eat?

320
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,380
- Chocolate or ice cream? 
- Chocolate

321
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:27,480
Bring a chocolate

322
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:29,180
Tell me Vicky

323
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:31,640
Master, it’s about

324
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,200
They have selected you to play 
in Australia through auction

325
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:37,410
You have come here to 
get a code of conduct

326
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:41,290
Because I haven’t taken you 
anywhere and promoting my son

327
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:42,040
You are leaving from here?

328
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,180
Yes master. Even I have a family

329
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:46,210
What promotion is it?

330
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:47,280
UFC

331
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:49,330
Can you match their techniques?

332
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:50,780
Let’s get into an agreement

333
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,710
As you are going out I don’t know 
your skill level and condition

334
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:57,720
You need to uphold the name of the academy

335
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:58,950
- Babu 
- Sir

336
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:00,710
- Get the agreement drafted 
- Okay sir

337
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,300
Master

338
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:02,980
That’s not necessary

339
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:04,810
If you want the code of conduct

340
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,330
Put the gloves and come up

341
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,060
Boys continue

342
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:57,350
Dad!

343
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,860
Dad!

344
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:59,150
Hey! Catch her

345
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:00,300
Catch her!

346
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,630
Fire! It’s burning

347
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,810
Stop the fire

348
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:09,790
Stop the fire

349
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,510
Hold it! Hold it!

350
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:41,020
Uh-oh!

351
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:52,660
Look at these

352
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:54,580
- Hey who is this 
- Come inside

353
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,900
- Are you in a running race? 
- My dear, it’s you

354
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,450
In sometime my heart 
almost exploded

355
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:06,170
I though you will give me a grand 
reception as I come out of jail

356
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:07,910
You guys are running 
for your life

357
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:11,260
- Where did you keep your hand now? 
- It was itching so I just kept it here

358
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:13,500
Scratching, just get lost

359
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:16,940
Our firework, just blew 
up a big boxing academy

360
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:17,470
Quiet!

361
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:20,710
How did this mode of 
terrorism brew within you?

362
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:23,280
When we go to get some stuff 
we should just get that

363
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:24,510
We cannot burn things down

364
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:26,060
If we didn’t burn it it would bend

365
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:27,980
Can you tell me something 
that I will understand

366
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:30,740
The one responsible for all this is the 
girl Sadhana in the opposite house

367
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:31,850
Yes that girl

368
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,230
That girl!

369
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:35,420
What’s your problem with that girl?

370
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:38,300
She’s a timid girl who does not 
raise her head as she walks

371
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:44,440
It’s because of girls like 
this that we have rains

372
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:46,700
( talking)

373
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:49,680
How docile

374
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:51,570
You take it. You keep it

375
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:52,190
Hey!

376
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:54,090
Sister you get the water

377
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:55,110
Sister?

378
00:24:56,010 --> 00:24:58,340
Hey you are standing here for long. 
What do you want ?

379
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,100
Give me a Re 1 shampoo sachet

380
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:01,850
What’s this nonsense 
through the night

381
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,390
- It’s gas bro 
- Then join a cylinder company

382
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:05,030
For subsidy I can’t pledge my pride

383
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,420
From when did you have pride?

384
00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:08,330
- Seriously 
- Hey firework

385
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:09,670
- walk by the side 
- Why?

386
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:11,750
For how long will this 
girl walk behind you

387
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:12,310
Oh God!

388
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:15,390
You are going to school 
Can’t you ring the bell?

389
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:17,400
No uncle if if I ring the 
bell it will be noisy

390
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:19,970
They might be discussing something 
important and it will disturb them

391
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:21,710
- That’s why 
- You go my dear

392
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:27,300
See in the age of 
liptop, Facebook

393
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:28,760
Look at this girl in our street

394
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:31,720
- Flashback? 
- Yes

395
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:33,340
That was during the time 
she went to college

396
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:36,900
When she started working, that 
petty thing developed horns

397
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,410
Uncle who posted memes got arrested. 
Puncture, you're next

398
00:25:41,530 --> 00:25:43,130
How come you are leaving early ?

399
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:45,160
I am getting 70K salary

400
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:46,420
Don’t I need to leave early

401
00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:50,520
Do you know what’s 70K?

402
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:52,090
It’s seventy thousand

403
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:54,350
Hey shopkeeper

404
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,600
Do you have shampoo in a 5 liter pack?

405
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,550
I have kerosene in 5 liter pack

406
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:02,240
Then pour it out and 
burn down your shop. Good day

407
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:06,770
Ladyfingers , brinjal, potatoes ,Carrots

408
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:07,910
Hey vegetable man

409
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:09,340
Do you have broccoli

410
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:10,600
I don’t sell country chicken

411
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:13,440
Country brute, you ask for something else

412
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:18,440
Iceberg lettuce,jackfruit, avocado, 
black olives Do you have any of these?

413
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:19,890
I have nothing like this?

414
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:21,630
Then why the onions did you come?

415
00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:23,770
I came here to sell onions

416
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,140
Then give half a kilo of that

417
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:28,850
It’s okay leave it

418
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:32,100
She’s a working girl 
She’s earning something

419
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:34,150
She will show off for sometime

420
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:35,120
Is it a big deal?

421
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:36,800
If she shows it someone else it’s fine

422
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:39,160
If she shows it to us! 
Oh my god

423
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:40,870
What did she do?

424
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:43,430
Where will everyone keep the alarm?

425
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:45,280
Near the head or near the ear

426
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:48,170
She kept it for the entire area

427
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:51,560
Bro, the show's over. Let's go home

428
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:54,270
Sadhana alarm has gone off

429
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:56,020
Now we all need to get to work

430
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,850
First, we must find a place to bury you!

431
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:00,560
As if he’s a big agitator 
trying to change the world

432
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,180
She wants to exercise 
and for that...

433
00:27:09,050 --> 00:27:10,010
Take that stone

434
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:17,220
- Take that! 
- Game over!

435
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,160
You!

436
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:19,390
You broke it off. Now what?

437
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:22,260
Don’t talk in 
between, listen fully

438
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:29,580
Bro if we are angry she annoys us further

439
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:32,380
I was just wondering why 
Sadhana’s alarm didn’t go off

440
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,850
- There you go 
- Why is he promoting her everyday?

441
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,150
Break it dude

442
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:45,200
You are screaming as if 
you have an electric shot

443
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:46,270
What happened?

444
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:58,720
What’s this?

445
00:27:58,770 --> 00:28:00,770
- You just gave it for few people and closing it down 
- There’s no water

446
00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:02,910
Give me half a pot it’s urgent

447
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:03,810
It's empty

448
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:06,770
Hey she’s having a 
separate tube for herself

449
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:09,180
She’s taken more than half of it

450
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:12,340
If they ask her to do rainwater harvesting, 
she’s harvesting it for herself

451
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:13,930
Come

452
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:15,850
Bro, my stomach is churning

453
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:16,950
Bro!

454
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:18,030
Go

455
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:20,390
Why are you going into 
my house bathroom?

456
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,300
Don’t let him in. I am going

457
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:23,650
- You wait 
- Dad, you go

458
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,140
Will someone go to the 
bathroom to keep a bomb?

459
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:26,200
He’s going to attend 
nature’s call

460
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:28,710
Go to your house 
Dad, you go

461
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:29,240
Let me go

462
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:31,930
If you get all the water in 
this area where will we go

463
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,580
Why are you talking in this volume? 
Reduce it. Else it will explode

464
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:36,570
Bro, the storm is 
going to leash out

465
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:38,730
Don't fear bro

466
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:42,390
Let me use the bathroom for this

467
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,040
Look

468
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,890
If I take a bath in salt 
water it does not suit me

469
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:52,800
So I am paying RS 
2000 and buying water

470
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:56,260
If you want, you pay and get water

471
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:57,190
Understood?

472
00:28:58,090 --> 00:28:59,220
Sadhana

473
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,490
You don’t know whom you 
are locking horns with

474
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,860
Time to get some brand new clothes

475
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:08,530
Who is this parking the 
vehicle right in the middle?

476
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:10,840
Instead of the middle can 
I park it in your mouth?

477
00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:14,600
What are you doing in my area? I will fly 
pigeons on your face. Get out of here

478
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:17,650
This is the pick up point for Sadhana madam

479
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:19,840
It’s her order to park the car here

480
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:23,010
Bro, the election money 
is playing in full swing

481
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:25,140
We need not go for jobs 
for at least a month

482
00:29:25,610 --> 00:29:26,500
We can have a blast!

483
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:28,520
I need to go for the job 
Move the vehicle

484
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:29,090
Hello!

485
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:32,150
Madam gives RS 500 above the meter

486
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:35,800
I am watching you, you’re talking like *#$&

487
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:38,050
Move the vehicle else will stamp it over

488
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,740
Keep quite. Madam is coming

489
00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:45,090
What’s this they are wearing 
coordinated costumes

490
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:46,640
Still their dresses are incomplete!

491
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:49,150
It stinks of garbage

492
00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:51,320
For our standards should we live here?

493
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,600
You don’t have to, you can 
live in the graveyard

494
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:56,890
Ignore him, we should live in 
posh areas like Poes garden

495
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:59,080
At the age of being in the pyre 
he wants to be in Poes garden

496
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:02,180
Alexa play the song ( old 
Tamil song mocking them)

497
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:03,520
Who is Alexa?

498
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,870
Must be her dad's mistress

499
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:08,680
Awesome dear

500
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:12,010
Come on, dear

501
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:13,330
Leave

502
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:18,540
We were struggling but the 
entire area was glorifying her

503
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:19,310
#New moon Festival

504
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:21,660
# Cricket

505
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:24,930
Let’s take a selfie

506
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:27,180
We decided to show her who 
is the real show off!

507
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:28,920
We have donated RS 5000 
for the temple offering

508
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,710
Are you delighted with 
the flex hoarding?

509
00:30:30,770 --> 00:30:31,830
Yes! Looks good

510
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:35,370
Why can’t you just say Puncture? 
You say it’s Puncture alias Puncture

511
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:36,950
You call yourself Firework alias Sakthi

512
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:39,630
I don’t have a second name 
That’s why

513
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:40,900
Get lost

514
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:42,990
Now you will know who’s 
eminent in this area

515
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:44,180
When she sees our banner

516
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:49,760
RS 10000 for porridge drinking

517
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:51,180
Sadhana Sha

518
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:52,760
As if she’s from the family 
that ruled the capital

519
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:57,040
Changing it from a porridge pouring to a 
porridge drinking festival

520
00:30:57,090 --> 00:31:02,570
We invite Sadhana Sha to bring 
cheer and joy to this area

521
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:06,690
Sadhana madam is going to drink the 
porridge now. Is everyone ready?

522
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:09,320
"3 2 1"

523
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:19,550
A special thanks to all who have come 
for this porridge drinking festival

524
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:25,400
I can’t participate in 
today’s musical function

525
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:27,870
As my owner is traveling abroad

526
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:36,520
I am responsible for his movable 
and immovable properties

527
00:31:37,010 --> 00:31:38,400
We will be responsible to bring it down

528
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,080
We went there to damage her academy

529
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,600
The police who came to investigate made 
us informers and roped us with her

530
00:31:44,890 --> 00:31:46,690
You are police informers?

531
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:48,350
Reduce the shock

532
00:31:48,410 --> 00:31:52,470
To find the cups stolen under your 
management I have assigned two informers

533
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:54,510
See my informers

534
00:31:56,270 --> 00:31:57,270
Notice their style

535
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,360
They are the useless 
scoundrels near my house

536
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:02,830
They are not worthy of a penny

thieves used sneezing powder

539
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:08,470
These guys are useless

540
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,740

they are good informers

Greetings. I'm fine

543
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:15,160

- Handle 
- Did she ask police to handle her?

545
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:19,630
No it’s the handle of the 
cup lost by your owner

546
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:22,140
You know who found it?

Coming. In a minute

610
00:36:47,730 --> 00:36:48,910
The missing cheque

611
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:52,610
If it’s open will you just barge in

612
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:53,470
What’s this ?

613
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:59,810
This? Puncture is basically 
a sports person

614
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:02,450
They gave it to him when 
he was man of the match

615
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:03,560
What sport?

616
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,480
Pubg

617
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:08,900
- Pubg sport! 
- Pubg sport?

618
00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:09,430
Of course

619
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:12,980
They are jumping, running, 
chasing,shooting. It’s a sport

620
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:16,930
Then why have they given the cheque 
in the name of my boss Nilan

621
00:37:17,650 --> 00:37:18,760
Is it written like that?

622
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:21,610
He must have given so they 
must have put his name

623
00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:24,250
You have stolen the 
cheque and lying to me

624
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:27,270
What’s this noise? Won’t you 
let me relieve in peace?

625
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:30,860
He’s telling you and you are 
questioning him.

626
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,760
Puncture!

627
00:37:32,830 --> 00:37:35,550
You’re doubting us? Won’t you believe us?

628
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:37,960
It’s the washroom cup

629
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:41,880
It’s shinning because of 
the fantastic maintenance

630
00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:43,790
It’s not the washroom cup

631
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:46,030
It’s my boss cup, it’s 
his sentimental cup

632
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:49,090
For a year, I polished it everyday

633
00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:52,270
Bro, she found out

634
00:37:52,530 --> 00:37:54,800
- I told you so many times to throw it out 
- Then how will I clean up?

635
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,190
Run you crack head!

636
00:37:56,690 --> 00:37:59,590
You both are the ones who 
stole at our academy

637
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:02,570
Wait I will get you caught 
with the police right now

638
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:03,850
Call him

639
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:06,000
Before that there’s a short film. 
Do you want to see it?

640
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:07,540
It will be interesting

641
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:12,090
Here

642
00:38:12,810 --> 00:38:14,070
Hold it. It will be comfortable

643
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:16,810
Hey owner do you 
have a conscience?

644
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,500
Or at least some brains

645
00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:21,300
If you had why would you make 
that dumb guy the manager

646
00:38:21,530 --> 00:38:23,190
He’s asking me to sweep, to mop

647
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:26,080
And he’s asking me to 
polish the cup that you got

648
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:29,350
Watch one day I will get people to steal 
it and will then dump it at the dump yard

649
00:38:29,410 --> 00:38:30,390
Is it nice?

650
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:35,180
At the palatial bungalow 
young girl’s street dance

651
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:36,850
We will also tell the police

652
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:39,520
It was this girl who drew the 
plan for us and asked us to steal

653
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:42,870
You are in the opposite house. 
The manager already doubts you

654
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:44,460
The police will easily believe it

655
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:48,390
They will handcuff you. They 
will drag you across the streets

656
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:51,810
Those who kept the flex for you. 
Sadhana sha army

657
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,720
They will smear your flex with cow dung

658
00:38:53,990 --> 00:38:56,430
From the time you got this 
job, how audacious you were

659
00:38:56,490 --> 00:38:58,380
That’s why we did this. Got it?

660
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,530
You created a ruckus. In 
return I created a ruckus

661
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:01,860
That's it. Go now

662
00:39:03,370 --> 00:39:04,260
Hey Cylinder!

663
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:09,440
Broccoli! Do you 
want some broccoli

664
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:11,520
There’s the five liter shampoo

665
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:13,690
No give me the one rupee sachet

666
00:39:16,990 --> 00:39:20,150
Bro, as this Sadhana has toned down

667
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,830
The entire neighborhood is dull

668
00:39:23,290 --> 00:39:24,390
Where's everyone?

669
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:26,360
Yes. The whole place looks empty

670
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:28,190
You seem to have feelings for that girl

671
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:29,730
Feelings?

672
00:39:29,850 --> 00:39:31,370
Never

673
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,370
My eyes are always sturdy. It never waters

674
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:38,740
Bro that hot head is 
talking to the rouges

675
00:39:38,830 --> 00:39:40,430
What are they doing here?

676
00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:44,690
Bro, I think they are coming for us

677
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:45,940
Let’s check

678
00:39:48,890 --> 00:39:50,110
- Hey Sadhana

679
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:51,750
Why are you giving them money?

680
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,720
Why do you care?

681
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:56,000
Because of you guys my 
certificate is locked up

682
00:39:56,250 --> 00:39:58,290
I thought I will steal it with their help

683
00:39:58,510 --> 00:39:59,930
I got a job in another place

684
00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:01,890

Send them back

We will get it for you 
Send them away

00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:13,850
What's Cylinder thinking?

00:40:15,390 --> 00:40:16,520

- Yeah

691
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:17,850
Get out

692
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:18,530
Get out

693
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:22,440
- Hey Puncture 
- You are taking away our client!

694
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:23,830
Hey!

695
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:27,130
I will bathe you without water 
and will wipe you without towel

696
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:29,620
Leave. We know how to take 
care of our area girl

00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:31,010
- Am I right, dude? 
- Damn it!

698
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:34,900
Area? 
If I slit you

699
00:40:36,730 --> 00:40:37,740
Should I hold it?

700
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:46,450
Do you know what’s kung fu?

701
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,140
He’s a black belt in it

702
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:50,790
He’s showing us a circus. 
Let’s teach him a lesson

703
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:51,680

You have become friends?

711
00:41:05,890 --> 00:41:07,830
We sing the song of friendship

712
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:09,610
Don’t let go of him. 
He’s a brilliant boy

713
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:11,820
He won't spare the audio thief

714
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:13,460
- Like you will ever do that! 
- Come

715
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:16,000
There’s a spark on his face

716
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:18,330
Till this man is the police 
there’s no problem for us

717
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:22,840
Then take the file and 
burn down everything

718
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:24,920
If my file alone goes missing 
they will have their doubts

719
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:28,220
Bro, she’s a seasoned house burner

720
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:33,620
So you took that girl’s file 
and burnt down the place

721
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,320
This is your file right? 
Here

722
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:37,700
Thank you

723
00:41:37,890 --> 00:41:40,180
Also don’t quit 
immediately from the job

724
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:42,750
Just go for few days. 
Then quietly leave the job

725
00:41:43,870 --> 00:41:44,660
Did you call me?

726
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:46,600
- No 
- That’s fine

727
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:49,110
Puncture told me that you have 
taken great pain to get the file

728
00:41:49,150 --> 00:41:50,470
She might develop feelings for you

729
00:41:50,530 --> 00:41:53,620
Look Cylinder, basically I 
don’t like this nonsense

730
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:54,920
Get lost

731
00:41:54,990 --> 00:41:56,010
Cool buddy. Take care

732
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:57,130
A lemon juice for me

733
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:58,360
- Bro, what did she say? 
- She said "Get lost!"

734
00:41:58,440 --> 00:41:59,140
Cool buddy!

735
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:08,550
No need for a complaint. 
We will take care of it

736
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,670
I enquired about the Kanyakumari

737
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:12,710
She was in Kerala sub jail for 6 years

738
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:14,620
Then they shifted her to Kannur Jail

739
00:42:14,830 --> 00:42:15,900
Have asked for the details

740
00:42:20,130 --> 00:42:22,280
- Hello 
- Sir , retired commissioner Gangadharan?

741
00:42:22,390 --> 00:42:23,080
Yes

742
00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:25,520
Sir you enquired about Kanyakumari

743
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:28,030
- She was released 4 days ago 
- Thank you

744
00:42:28,430 --> 00:42:30,230
Nilan, she was released 4 days back

745
00:42:30,450 --> 00:42:32,890
Your doubts are right. 
The one who came was Kanyakumari

746
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,440
Did this work for you?

747
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:43,000
It won’t work for me

748
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:47,800
She get 70K, for her a guy 
who gets 90K will suit best

749
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:51,690
For our range, we 
need to work hard

750
00:42:51,770 --> 00:42:53,160
Work hard?

751
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:55,840
Is it easy to steal? Do you know 
how much we need to work for that?

752
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:57,260
True true that’s our duty

753
00:42:57,300 --> 00:43:01,200
With this hard earned money the girl 
should know how to run the family

754
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:03,820
Else it should be someone sharp 
who runs the business with me

755
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:04,470
Then it will be double okay

756
00:43:04,970 --> 00:43:07,650
I am proud to have brought you up

757
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:08,800
Thank you buddy

758
00:43:08,850 --> 00:43:09,890
Fine you said

759
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:14,200
Neither Love nor money invoved yet you 
have risked so much and burnt it down

760
00:43:14,310 --> 00:43:16,030
If your face gets caught on CCTV

761
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:20,100
Are we animals at the zoo to 
show our faces to the camera

762
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,840
Who is this? Looking just like a monkey

763
00:43:23,910 --> 00:43:25,610
Sir, a person’s face is captured here

764
00:43:26,750 --> 00:43:29,290
Dad Our MMA website is blocked

765
00:43:29,610 --> 00:43:32,590
They spoke to me from the technical 
department. What’s happening dad?

766
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:34,000
What’s happening?

767
00:43:34,090 --> 00:43:35,460
I will take care. You go

768
00:43:39,830 --> 00:43:42,210
One person has covered his 
face cleverly and escaped

769
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:55,440
If two people have come along

770
00:43:56,060 --> 00:43:57,380
Then she has some major plans

771
00:43:58,650 --> 00:44:00,170
Sorry sir. I am late

772
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:03,730
I offered prayers for the MMA to go well

773
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:04,860
Here’s the offering

774
00:44:08,550 --> 00:44:10,980
I told them to burn the files 
They have burnt the academy

775
00:44:13,290 --> 00:44:14,020
Puncture

776
00:44:15,690 --> 00:44:17,040
We should not spare her

777
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:17,700
Nilan

778
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:20,220
Leave it I will handle this. 
You take care of MMA

779
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:25,610
Greetings sir

780
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:27,280
Unofficially I need a small favor

781
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:29,590
Why are you using such phrases. 
Please tell will get it done

782
00:44:29,790 --> 00:44:31,860
I will send a photo of a 
lady through WhatsApp

783
00:44:31,950 --> 00:44:32,450
Yes sir

784
00:44:32,510 --> 00:44:34,430
Our men need to find her

785
00:44:34,590 --> 00:44:35,180
Definitely sir

786
00:44:35,290 --> 00:44:37,610
Either alive or dead

787
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:38,180
Alright sir

788
00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:39,490
Get your license

789
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:42,360
I don’t have proper papers. If they 
catch me they will fine me heavily

790
00:44:42,410 --> 00:44:44,580
Please get down. 
Your address is close by

791
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:47,080
Please get down. 
It’s just close by

792
00:44:47,370 --> 00:44:49,030

00:44:49,590 --> 00:44:50,960

00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:52,110

Come

796
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:55,160
Which locality? Where’s your house?

797
00:44:55,250 --> 00:44:56,680
Just close by in Kanchipuram

798
00:44:56,790 --> 00:44:57,740
Where are going at this time?

799
00:44:57,870 --> 00:44:58,710
To my relatives house

800
00:44:58,730 --> 00:44:59,680
What’s in your bag?

801
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:00,940
Just clothes

802
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,440
Open your bag

803
00:45:02,550 --> 00:45:04,730
Wait, that Cylinder is caling me

804
00:45:04,830 --> 00:45:05,650
Show what’s inside

805
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:06,400
Hello

806
00:45:06,450 --> 00:45:08,800
I told you to just burn the files. There’s 
another woman who has come with you

807
00:45:09,030 --> 00:45:10,180
I didn’t take anyone with me

808
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:11,890
- You didn’t? 
- Did I say that in Hindi?

809
00:45:11,930 --> 00:45:13,290
Alright. Be careful

810
00:45:13,550 --> 00:45:15,330
Oh! I know how to take care of myself

811
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:16,820
I will blow it once please

812
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:18,530
- Please sir 
- Me?

813
00:45:18,950 --> 00:45:20,220
Let me do it first

814
00:45:21,390 --> 00:45:23,430
Careful don’t suck up the machine

815
00:45:23,890 --> 00:45:24,710
There's nothing, sir

816
00:45:27,490 --> 00:45:29,790
- How come you have so much cash? 
- It’s my cash

817
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:32,250
- You need to see the higher officer 
- Hang up. I'll take care

818
00:45:32,630 --> 00:45:33,560
Shut up

819
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:35,160
I felt something was 
fishy when I saw you

820
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:39,850
Take everything and follow me

821
00:45:41,190 --> 00:45:43,550
Sir, the driver must not be drunk 
but the passengers can be

822
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:45,250
Here sir, you're looking 
for this, right?

823
00:45:45,470 --> 00:45:47,690
- You guys go home. I'll come later 
- Aren't you coming with us?

824
00:45:48,460 --> 00:45:50,590
Buy more booze while coming home

825
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:52,300
- Sir 
- What is it?

826
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:54,230
That lady has a lot of money

827
00:45:54,350 --> 00:45:55,570
She appears to be strange

828
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:57,180
Who is that?

829
00:45:58,280 --> 00:45:59,820
I asked her to come behind

830
00:46:01,070 --> 00:46:03,260
She was here. 
It was this lady

831
00:46:04,150 --> 00:46:06,100
- This one? 
- Yes

832
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:22,420
Leave it

833
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:30,130
You look like a respectable person

834
00:46:30,430 --> 00:46:33,590
Just give the bag and leave. 
It’s best for both of us

835
00:46:50,450 --> 00:46:52,060
My hand! My hand!

836
00:46:52,170 --> 00:46:54,170
Let go of my hand! It won't 
look good if I hit you

837
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:25,760
It’s intimidating?

838
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:32,260
You don’t know about me. Get lost. 
I am sparing you out of pity

839
00:47:34,550 --> 00:47:36,780
Looks like someone we know

840
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:39,420
What Bro? Did you 
manage to get something

841
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:41,200
Well, dude...

842
00:47:41,830 --> 00:47:45,540
I went. Think that lady is awesome. 
She just gathered over a dozen people

843
00:47:45,870 --> 00:47:48,050
That’s why just 
handled them and came

844
00:47:48,250 --> 00:47:49,430
Who, you?

845
00:47:49,930 --> 00:47:50,970
I saw it

846
00:47:51,350 --> 00:47:55,410
I saw your style. 
I also her supremacy there

847
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:57,010
Look, he's feeling embarrassed

848
00:47:57,050 --> 00:47:59,270
When we when to pee we saw it

849
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:03,000
Don’t talk about this to anyone

850
00:48:03,070 --> 00:48:05,840
She might be a rowdy baby

851
00:48:05,910 --> 00:48:10,710
In our job if we get caught we are doomed

852
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:13,000
Aren't you ashamed to talk like this?

853
00:48:13,580 --> 00:48:15,950
That lady has loads of money

854
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:19,470
Thought I'll trap her 
somehow but she got me

855
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:36,900
- Sir 
- Yes Sanjeevi

856
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:39,440
- Sir we saw the lady 
in the picture - Okay

857
00:48:39,450 --> 00:48:40,660
But when we tried to catch her

858
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:42,150
Just say it!

859
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:44,300
She was hurt on the 
head and she died

860
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:46,030
We were about to do that

861
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:48,410
You bring the corpse to Ennore yard. 
We will talk there

862
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:49,140
Okay sir

863
00:48:52,580 --> 00:48:54,680
If we take her there 
it’s of no use

864
00:48:54,810 --> 00:48:55,920
If we finish her off

865
00:48:56,420 --> 00:48:58,100
At least we will get that money

866
00:48:58,510 --> 00:49:00,710
Let's get done with this. 
These guys!

867
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:05,300
Get down

868
00:49:05,410 --> 00:49:07,400
The station is close by. You need to sign

869
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:08,220
Get down

870
00:49:19,710 --> 00:49:22,020
The police are going to do something. 
Take a video of it

871
00:49:24,830 --> 00:49:25,740
Give that bag

872
00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:27,510
Give it!

873
00:49:27,870 --> 00:49:28,720
Zoom

874
00:49:28,820 --> 00:49:29,830
If you don’t give it

875
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:32,510
Give it!

876
00:49:36,490 --> 00:49:38,170
Hey, trying to assault the police!

877
00:50:38,150 --> 00:50:39,950
Just see how viral this is going to be

878
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:55,060
It's fake one

879
00:50:58,380 --> 00:50:59,820
This is the real one

880
00:51:00,410 --> 00:51:01,910
It's not fake. It's real

881
00:51:07,270 --> 00:51:08,440
This is Adimurai

882
00:51:08,620 --> 00:51:10,560
Mother of all martial arts

883
00:51:10,930 --> 00:51:13,730
Adimurai evolved from South 
of India in Tamilnadu

884
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:15,150
It’s the mother of all 
self defense martial arts

885
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:21,140
From Adimurai evolved Cailat, 
Veronkai, Puttupiruvu, Eduteri

886
00:51:21,350 --> 00:51:25,500
All these have transformed world 
wide as Silat, Karate, Judo, Akiton

887
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:28,660
Our Muay Thai also evolved from Adimurai.

888
00:51:29,150 --> 00:51:32,210
When foreigners conquered 
India they banned Adimurai

889
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:35,720
Slowly it vanished from the Indian soil

890
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:37,750
People started to forget it

891
00:51:37,970 --> 00:51:42,320
Now when I see someone performing 
it with such precision

892
00:51:42,410 --> 00:51:43,520
I am taken aback

893
00:51:49,550 --> 00:51:52,530
How’s it? When you tried to catch her, 
she got hurt on the head and died

894
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:54,100
- Sorry sir 
- You!

895
00:51:54,390 --> 00:51:56,710
As they tried to extract money 
and since the video went viral

896
00:51:56,810 --> 00:51:59,780
The commissioner asked the case to 
closed as the fault was on them

897
00:52:02,090 --> 00:52:03,440
Your treatment won’t work

898
00:52:04,410 --> 00:52:05,620
Adimurai will only cure it

899
00:52:09,970 --> 00:52:11,440
As the academy was hit by fire

900
00:52:12,570 --> 00:52:15,190
They fear the safety of the players 
and ask us to shut down MMA

901
00:52:16,790 --> 00:52:19,130
I am going to meet the 
technical director in person

902
00:52:20,060 --> 00:52:21,790
By the time I am back from Bangkok

903
00:52:22,250 --> 00:52:24,120
I should hear the news that she’s dead

904
00:52:36,270 --> 00:52:37,690
Who are you? What do you want?

905
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:38,940
This?

906
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:40,690
This one?

907
00:52:41,270 --> 00:52:43,410
My son Puncture, 
my older son Firework

908
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:45,300
That’s me Kolusu. How’s the combo?

909
00:52:48,380 --> 00:52:50,930
If I had taken something from you, 
let me know will return it

910
00:52:51,150 --> 00:52:53,030
Don’t come in search and hit me

911
00:52:53,250 --> 00:52:55,030
Are you new to the job?

912
00:53:05,070 --> 00:53:05,900
Forgive me

913
00:53:07,380 --> 00:53:08,380
It was my situation

914
00:53:09,030 --> 00:53:10,730
I brought him up a thief

915
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:14,160
I thought he was dead

916
00:53:15,380 --> 00:53:17,300
You have brought him 
back in-front of my eyes

917
00:53:17,470 --> 00:53:18,560
I don’t know how to say...

918
00:53:21,980 --> 00:53:22,570
Where is he?

919
00:53:22,930 --> 00:53:25,400
- Take a big one 
- Big

920
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:27,170
- This? 
- Ok,bro

921
00:53:27,230 --> 00:53:28,330
Don't snatch like monkey!

922
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:32,050
In matters of food I am a monkey

923
00:53:32,130 --> 00:53:34,090
I didn’t deny that

924
00:53:35,190 --> 00:53:37,610
One guy is eyeing me for long

925
00:53:37,890 --> 00:53:38,980
Let me check him out

926
00:53:39,030 --> 00:53:41,060
- Go! Got Kinder joy? 
- I don't sell those

927
00:53:41,210 --> 00:53:42,310
Then why run a shop like this?

928
00:53:42,340 --> 00:53:44,730
What dear ? You’re eyeing me for long?

929
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:47,010
I want to check if you are 
the same monkey face?

930
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:49,380
Hey that’s me

931
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:51,620
The quality is so far. 
Can’t you get a new phone?

932
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:55,690
He burnt the academy and 
look at his audacity

933
00:53:55,780 --> 00:53:58,450
Bro they found out that we 
burnt down the academy

934
00:53:58,500 --> 00:53:59,190
Catch them

935
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:01,000
- Dude, take off! 
- Bro, run!

936
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:02,130
Catch them!

937
00:54:12,510 --> 00:54:19,410
( recorded message to 
recharge the phone)

938
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:21,340
There’s no signal

939
00:54:21,890 --> 00:54:24,830
They should be roaming somewhere around. 
Wait here will get them

940
00:54:25,060 --> 00:54:28,090
Yes it’s a good salary. They 
want me to join in two days

941
00:54:33,450 --> 00:54:34,570
Ms. Sumathi, you've put on weight

942
00:54:34,630 --> 00:54:36,020
Firecracker, you'll explode soon

943
00:54:36,110 --> 00:54:37,820
But looks like you'll explode first

944
00:54:39,870 --> 00:54:40,680
Did see two guys run this way?

945
00:54:40,780 --> 00:54:43,020
They went to the right!

946
00:54:49,630 --> 00:54:50,270
Tell me

947
00:54:50,470 --> 00:54:52,380
How many times should I call? 
Won’t you answer ?

948
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:53,680
Four times! What’s it?

949
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:55,910
That day I asked about that lady. 
You said you didn’t know

950
00:54:55,980 --> 00:54:59,120
Now she’s in your house. 
What are you both plotting ?

951
00:54:59,250 --> 00:55:01,940
We are running for our life. 
They have identified punture's face

952
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,360
If I get caught, I will definitely 
rope you and your father in

953
00:55:07,130 --> 00:55:09,080
Come soon. They are here

954
00:55:09,150 --> 00:55:10,780
We have been hiding for a long time

955
00:55:18,850 --> 00:55:19,350
Hello

956
00:55:19,390 --> 00:55:20,960
Sir, I saw the lady 
who came to kill you

957
00:55:21,370 --> 00:55:22,510
Saw her? 
Where?

958
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:24,510
Ennore yard

959
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:25,960
I will take care

960
00:55:26,650 --> 00:55:27,280
Yes Nilan

961
00:55:27,310 --> 00:55:30,250
Ganga I got the information that 
Kanyakumari is in Ennore yard

962
00:55:30,420 --> 00:55:31,870
Kill her! Kill her! Kill her!

963
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:39,830
You’re Kanyakumari?

964
00:55:40,790 --> 00:55:43,230
Uncle wanted you to come to Ennore yard

965
00:55:43,890 --> 00:55:45,440
I don’t know where it is?

966
00:55:45,540 --> 00:55:47,320
I can take you. Come

967
00:55:57,710 --> 00:55:59,010
You go get the car

968
00:56:06,850 --> 00:56:09,040
Drop her near Ennore yard

969
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:15,220
Puncture, why are you inviting trouble?

970
00:56:15,370 --> 00:56:16,870
- Yes, chief? 
- Where are you guys?

971
00:56:16,990 --> 00:56:19,340
We got that guy. We are chasing him

972
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:21,800
We found that lady. Come near Ennore yard

973
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:23,170
That guy is just close by

974
00:56:23,260 --> 00:56:24,540
That lady is most important. Come soon

975
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:25,910
Take the vehicle to Ennore yard

976
00:56:26,950 --> 00:56:27,790
Quick! Quick!

977
00:56:33,340 --> 00:56:33,840
Bro!

978
00:56:36,010 --> 00:56:39,370
That day you were boasting 
that’s it your area girl

979
00:56:39,550 --> 00:56:41,220
Come now

980
00:56:41,310 --> 00:56:44,620
Get lost. Do you know how many of 
them are chasing us from morning?

981
00:56:44,710 --> 00:56:46,480
- I didn’t get caught with anyone 
- Firework!

982
00:56:46,750 --> 00:56:48,690
Move

983
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:50,650
I was searching for you all over

984
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:52,660
This is his father

985
00:56:53,380 --> 00:56:54,560
- Hey! Firework 
- Hey!

986
00:56:54,610 --> 00:56:56,090
Show your skills dear

987
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:58,780
I have no sentiments

988
00:56:58,910 --> 00:56:59,560
That’s for you

989
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:01,810
My eyes never tear up

990
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:04,590
Don’t lose focus while talking. 
Finish my dad

991
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:07,070
Do a clean job. Don’t be angry dad

992
00:57:07,180 --> 00:57:08,060
Watch out!

993
00:57:09,030 --> 00:57:09,880
Get lost!

994
00:57:09,970 --> 00:57:11,820
- Don't leave me! 
- Catch them

995
00:57:25,740 --> 00:57:26,240
Look there

996
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,860
Bro she won’t leave 
without giving the money

997
00:57:34,230 --> 00:57:36,770
Someone is chasing there. 
Someone is chasing here

998
00:57:36,910 --> 00:57:39,670
Let’s loot the money from her and 
get away from here for sometime

999
00:57:39,710 --> 00:57:41,710
Our brains are the best!

1000
00:57:44,410 --> 00:57:45,950
Where did she go?

1001
00:57:49,230 --> 00:57:50,040
What uncle?

1002
00:57:50,170 --> 00:57:53,110
A lady came in search 
of me Did you see her?

1003
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:53,880
No uncle

1004
00:57:54,630 --> 00:57:56,160
- Fine 
- Who is she?

1005
00:57:57,470 --> 00:57:59,050
That’s Firework’s mother

1006
00:58:06,740 --> 00:58:09,270
- Please play the radio 
- Really? You want to hear songs now?

1007
00:58:09,550 --> 00:58:10,970
Shut up and sit down

1008
00:59:16,620 --> 00:59:17,120
Bro...

1009
00:59:17,660 --> 00:59:18,320
Steal it

1010
00:59:50,750 --> 00:59:52,260
You’re stop is next

1011
01:00:13,980 --> 01:00:15,870
You let go in the end

1012
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:21,120
I don’t know why. I feel something 
strange when I see her

1013
01:00:21,180 --> 01:00:23,440
Why are you looking at her face? 
Look at the money

1014
01:00:23,820 --> 01:00:25,240
There’s no passion

1015
01:00:25,300 --> 01:00:26,660
Put your papers and leave

1016
01:01:00,310 --> 01:01:00,810
Hey

1017
01:01:01,070 --> 01:01:03,270
Hey, that day I was in a 
good mood and didn’t steal

1018
01:01:03,300 --> 01:01:05,320
Today I will definitely do it. 
Let go of the bag

1019
01:01:06,570 --> 01:01:07,700
(Sakthi)

1020
01:01:12,070 --> 01:01:13,790
- Wait listen to me 
- Leave it

1021
01:01:13,860 --> 01:01:15,800
- Listen to me 
- Leave it

1022
01:01:16,620 --> 01:01:17,640
You should have that fear

1023
01:01:17,730 --> 01:01:19,550
- If I see you in my area 
- Wait

1024
01:01:20,710 --> 01:01:21,350
One minute

1025
01:01:56,950 --> 01:01:58,770
Did you nab it

1026
01:01:58,870 --> 01:01:59,970
Super bro

1027
01:02:00,290 --> 01:02:01,030
Hold her hands

1028
01:02:02,650 --> 01:02:04,180
Leave me

1029
01:02:05,300 --> 01:02:05,810
Leave me

1030
01:02:08,270 --> 01:02:10,540
This is our biggest sum so far

1031
01:02:10,810 --> 01:02:11,960
It’s in bundles

1032
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:29,450
Leave me

1033
01:02:32,950 --> 01:02:33,360
Bro

1034
01:02:33,950 --> 01:02:35,520
- What happened? 
- Nothing

1035
01:02:37,670 --> 01:02:40,740
On her hand my name Sakthi 
was tattooed. That’s why!

1036
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:42,970
Are you the only Sakthi?

1037
01:02:43,420 --> 01:02:44,580
Stop worrying for all this

1038
01:02:44,650 --> 01:02:46,250
First we need to discard this bag

1039
01:02:46,330 --> 01:02:48,290
Else they will sniff out with a dog

1040
01:02:48,450 --> 01:02:49,220
Fly away

1041
01:04:58,610 --> 01:04:59,970
Three dimensional rule

1042
01:05:10,230 --> 01:05:12,100
Just get him killed

1043
01:05:19,240 --> 01:05:22,700
Learnt to escape from the jungle

1044
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:26,680
Will break all the handcuffs 
to save the pride of the clan

1045
01:05:27,170 --> 01:05:31,000
Will take up Adimurai to wage this war

1046
01:05:31,230 --> 01:05:33,760
Will play in this arena

1047
01:05:34,660 --> 01:05:37,870
This is the group that fed on bravery

1048
01:06:45,740 --> 01:06:46,890
Why isn’t Ganga answering the phone?

1049
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:49,880
Brother don’t know who he is 
He’s creating a rampage here

1050
01:06:52,460 --> 01:06:54,280
Who is he? Show me his face

1051
01:06:54,340 --> 01:06:55,050
Will show now

1052
01:07:36,980 --> 01:07:46,690
Diraveyaperumal

1053
01:07:49,090 --> 01:07:52,750
What kindled you from inside and 
make you fight is Adimurai

1054
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:54,980
It’s the first self defense 
martial art of Tamilnadu

1055
01:07:55,020 --> 01:07:57,510
It’s was in the army of the Cheran, 
Cholas and the Pandya kings

1056
01:07:57,740 --> 01:08:00,480
From your ancestor Vellappa Mentor, 
came Muthaiya Mentor

1057
01:08:00,810 --> 01:08:02,170
He was a master of the craft

1058
01:08:02,380 --> 01:08:04,170
Even when the invaders cut his fingers

1059
01:08:04,460 --> 01:08:06,720
He thought the craft to others 
and spread its greatness

1060
01:08:07,050 --> 01:08:10,070
One such student who 
surpassed the mentor

1061
01:08:11,150 --> 01:08:13,330
Was your father, Diraveyaperumal

1062
01:08:51,280 --> 01:08:52,800
Diraveyam lost his parents

1063
01:08:52,940 --> 01:08:56,250
The dynasty and pride left 
behind by them was his wealth

1064
01:08:58,190 --> 01:09:01,830
There’s no one here to unlock 
the knots of Diraveyaperumal

1065
01:09:02,040 --> 01:09:05,350
If you challenge him, 
this is bound to happen

1066
01:09:05,670 --> 01:09:08,070
The only son of Muthaiya 
Mentor was Nilaparai

1067
01:09:08,260 --> 01:09:09,990
But he was not skilled in Adimurai

1068
01:09:10,550 --> 01:09:13,590
Our mentor always dreamt 
of him learning the craft

1069
01:09:24,220 --> 01:09:28,670
Don’t you know the pulse points 
where one will flip and fall

1070
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:31,010
There’s a rule written for the 
action and reaction for each hit

1071
01:09:31,050 --> 01:09:32,500
and the Subsequent reaction on 
each nerve, vein and muscle

1072
01:09:32,550 --> 01:09:35,080
It was written on the palm 
leaves 1000 years ago

1073
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:36,030
Why was it written?

1074
01:09:36,360 --> 01:09:38,680
Only to pass it on for the 
next generations to come

1075
01:09:38,840 --> 01:09:40,350
Let’s see if it has reached you?

1076
01:09:42,130 --> 01:09:44,550
Recite the scriptures for this technique

1077
01:09:45,110 --> 01:09:45,610
Tell

1078
01:09:45,830 --> 01:09:50,240
( reciting the scriptures in ancient 
Tamil about the technique of twist)

1079
01:09:51,470 --> 01:09:52,040
Complete it

1080
01:09:52,190 --> 01:09:56,040
They will press it with four fingers

1081
01:09:56,710 --> 01:09:57,630
Diraveyum

1082
01:09:57,700 --> 01:09:58,410
Yes master?

1083
01:10:00,830 --> 01:10:02,400
Recite the scripture

1084
01:10:03,230 --> 01:10:04,260
No need Master

1085
01:10:05,870 --> 01:10:07,690
I forgot, learnt it long back

1086
01:10:07,740 --> 01:10:09,370
Forgot! You?

1087
01:10:10,090 --> 01:10:11,080
Recite it

1088
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:22,640
( reciting the action and reaction to 
tackle the know in ancient Tamil)

1089
01:10:23,870 --> 01:10:24,550
Heard it?

1090
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:27,920
He knows it. He just...

1091
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:31,180
Trying to protect him?

1092
01:10:31,540 --> 01:10:33,470
He can’t receipt a word

1093
01:10:33,700 --> 01:10:36,210
I will do it, if I have 
a competent companion

1094
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:39,920
Competent companion

1095
01:10:40,520 --> 01:10:44,080
Kanya the craft of weaponry and 
mastering the skill these scriptures

1096
01:10:44,550 --> 01:10:47,890
When you perform recite the scriptures. 
Let our man hear it as well

1097
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:52,130
(Reciting ) The pride and devotion 
with with one performs the skills

1098
01:10:53,380 --> 01:10:54,560
Come on my man

1099
01:10:56,540 --> 01:11:02,430
(Reciting ) In lighting speed 
will the attack be for

1100
01:11:02,750 --> 01:11:07,980
It will split into two and 
one will sustain the war

1101
01:11:08,540 --> 01:11:11,700
Will pounce like a tiger 
and capture the crown

1102
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:15,180
Did you see your friend?

1103
01:11:15,250 --> 01:11:17,480
He deliberately lost. Can’t you see?

1104
01:11:17,770 --> 01:11:18,270
Get lost

1105
01:11:18,430 --> 01:11:20,710
Get lost. You heard the master!

1106
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:23,680
She learnt after you. You have lost to her

1107
01:11:24,440 --> 01:11:26,850
Learn at least something from Diraveyam

1108
01:11:27,540 --> 01:11:28,180
Leave it

1109
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:30,980
In the second part instead of 
parting left you parted right

1110
01:11:31,030 --> 01:11:32,550
Else your knife would 
have raised high

1111
01:11:34,780 --> 01:11:37,200
Our master says this only for you to excel

1112
01:11:37,260 --> 01:11:39,890
How can I learn?

1113
01:11:40,520 --> 01:11:41,890
Only if I am skilled can I perform

1114
01:11:42,650 --> 01:11:44,120
Leave it. It’s your father

1115
01:11:44,350 --> 01:11:46,840
When I failed in 10th grade As 
he insulted me before everyone

1116
01:11:46,890 --> 01:11:48,740
I should have stabbed him with the knife

1117
01:11:49,240 --> 01:11:50,420
It’s a mistake to have spared him

1118
01:11:50,460 --> 01:11:51,370
What are you talking?

1119
01:11:51,430 --> 01:11:52,770
Did I stab?

1120
01:11:53,160 --> 01:11:54,180
I am only taling in anger

1121
01:11:54,490 --> 01:11:56,520
Don’t you have some decorum 
even when you’re angry?

1122
01:11:56,620 --> 01:11:57,640
Talking like a lunatic

1123
01:11:59,710 --> 01:12:00,210
Yes

1124
01:12:00,410 --> 01:12:01,100
I am a lunatic

1125
01:12:01,450 --> 01:12:03,630
You won’t understand the pain 
and insults of this lunatic

1126
01:12:04,870 --> 01:12:07,010
If you keep back answering. 
What should I say?

1127
01:12:07,060 --> 01:12:09,520
What junior master, standing alone?

1128
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:10,910
Didn’t find a partner?

1129
01:12:11,190 --> 01:12:13,000
Will you partner with Kanya?

1130
01:12:13,080 --> 01:12:13,580
What?

1131
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:15,720
Asked if you will partner in a fight?

1132
01:12:15,850 --> 01:12:18,500
Morning won over your friend. 
Next in line is you

1133
01:12:18,660 --> 01:12:21,100
I wanted to ask you. Do 
you have some sense ?

1134
01:12:21,130 --> 01:12:22,650
At least you could have let go!

1135
01:12:22,680 --> 01:12:25,470
Junior master, should I let 
go because he’s Mentor’s son?

1136
01:12:25,590 --> 01:12:28,670
More than that the faith my 
mentor has in me is Supreme

1137
01:12:28,900 --> 01:12:30,750
I am sorry. Give way

1138
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:33,310
Where are the powder box 
and nits comb going now?

1139
01:12:34,390 --> 01:12:36,800
We are going to find her 
a groom like a superhero

1140
01:12:36,860 --> 01:12:38,430
Oh she’s a dream girl

1141
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:40,720
Irrespective of what you 
say I am a dream girl

1142
01:12:40,750 --> 01:12:42,850
Come and see the number of men eyeing me

1143
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:45,280
Where, where?

1144
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:47,740
Come with us will show you the crowd

1145
01:12:47,810 --> 01:12:49,320
Will come tomorrow

1146
01:12:54,020 --> 01:12:55,920
- How are you grandma? 
- I'm fine

1147
01:12:56,030 --> 01:12:58,800
- Give this medicine to Angalam when he comes home 
- Ok

1148
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:00,420
Don't drink it thinking 
it's some juice

1149
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:03,160
- Then it'll affect your health 
- Ok, dear

1150
01:13:04,130 --> 01:13:05,260
See you, grandma

1151
01:13:07,640 --> 01:13:11,250
What dream girl, there’s seems 
to less powder on your face?

1152
01:13:11,660 --> 01:13:13,240
Did they shut down the powder company?

1153
01:13:13,300 --> 01:13:16,300
There’s no dearth for this teasing. 
You forget what we discussed

1154
01:13:16,450 --> 01:13:17,870
Master! Greetings

1155
01:13:18,450 --> 01:13:19,950
Is she taking like a graduated girl?

1156
01:13:20,250 --> 01:13:22,470
I want unburden the responsibility 
and get her married

1157
01:13:22,470 --> 01:13:24,480
She’s adamant that she doesn’t like anyone

1158
01:13:24,770 --> 01:13:27,840
She’s already going for 
martial arts like other men

1159
01:13:28,450 --> 01:13:30,710
Why is self defense only for men?

1160
01:13:30,990 --> 01:13:34,580
Just see, will marry a man 
whose a master of Adimurai

1161
01:13:34,660 --> 01:13:36,500
Will teach my child 
in my womb the craft

1162
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:38,120
I will make him the master of masters

1163
01:13:38,230 --> 01:13:39,620
Fine

1164
01:13:39,750 --> 01:13:41,240
What did I say, I forgot!

1165
01:13:41,360 --> 01:13:43,120
You said you will help me find a groom

1166
01:13:44,100 --> 01:13:46,150
We will get her married 
according to her wish

1167
01:13:46,300 --> 01:13:49,170
Wherever he is we 
will bring him here

1168
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:55,260
He got the right grasp and struck him well

1169
01:13:55,310 --> 01:13:56,760
How’s this groom?

1170
01:13:57,260 --> 01:13:57,900
Rejected

1171
01:13:58,040 --> 01:14:00,280
The pride of a man is his mustache. 
He does not have that

1172
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:01,500
I see

1173
01:14:02,170 --> 01:14:03,360
You wanted a man with moustache, right?

1174
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:04,970
How’s this groom, Kanniappan?

1175
01:14:05,030 --> 01:14:07,450
If I get married to him, 
before me he will deliver a child

1176
01:14:07,620 --> 01:14:09,870
They brought a person in the 
last trimester for the game

1177
01:14:10,340 --> 01:14:11,010
Rejected

1178
01:14:11,050 --> 01:14:11,970
Name: Subramani

1179
01:14:12,660 --> 01:14:14,580
He has a mustache and no belly

1180
01:14:14,770 --> 01:14:15,830
I don’t like his name

1181
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:17,730
What’s the name that you like?

1182
01:14:18,290 --> 01:14:20,110
Junior mentor can we have a sword fight?

1183
01:14:20,580 --> 01:14:22,040
With you

1184
01:14:22,300 --> 01:14:24,890
You will get it to my neck 
and it will bring me shame

1185
01:14:26,410 --> 01:14:27,850
What? Remove that knife and talk

1186
01:14:28,020 --> 01:14:29,280
Single sword, parting scripture

1187
01:14:43,190 --> 01:14:44,670
You asked the name that I like

1188
01:14:46,450 --> 01:14:47,040
Diraveyum

1189
01:14:51,090 --> 01:14:52,410
From my younger days I like you

1190
01:14:53,110 --> 01:14:54,210
That why I learnt Adimurai

1191
01:14:55,090 --> 01:14:57,450
I feared our status disparity 
and did not tell you

1192
01:14:58,870 --> 01:14:59,750
Now I am telling you

1193
01:15:00,300 --> 01:15:01,150
I like you a lot

1194
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:03,040
I too like her

1195
01:15:03,090 --> 01:15:04,910
I think it’s only right that I tell you

1196
01:15:28,080 --> 01:15:33,070
There are some many desires 
Don’t know how to express it

1197
01:15:33,670 --> 01:15:38,250
It’s because of you the eyes didn’t rest 
Can’t find the reason

1198
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:43,660
The world is ours 
If you are with me

1199
01:15:44,380 --> 01:15:49,220
The heaven will open 
If I walk with you

1200
01:15:49,720 --> 01:15:54,530
The life is sweet 
When I rest on your shoulders

1201
01:15:54,770 --> 01:15:59,580
The wings will come out 
When I hold your hands

1202
01:15:59,670 --> 01:16:04,380
There’s no need to utter a word 
This is love

1203
01:16:04,730 --> 01:16:09,960
Inseparable you are always 
there in my thoughts

1204
01:16:10,050 --> 01:16:15,200
Irreplaceable you are 
always glued to my heart

1205
01:16:15,270 --> 01:16:20,490
Don’t leave my heart 
You are always in my thoughts

1206
01:16:20,710 --> 01:16:25,660
Without a loss 
With guard you in my heart

1207
01:16:49,130 --> 01:16:52,680
The feud between Master and his son 
exploded during the baby shower

1208
01:16:53,220 --> 01:16:54,500
Why can’t you get me married?

1209
01:16:54,810 --> 01:16:56,150
What’s this in public?

1210
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:02,130
A wife is not just to bear children. 
She should be for the heart and the mind

1211
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:03,640
Do you have it?

1212
01:17:04,200 --> 01:17:05,350
Useless fellow!

1213
01:17:15,240 --> 01:17:16,580
What’s all this? Why are you doing this?

1214
01:17:16,690 --> 01:17:18,980
Despite your father’s words 
he did not listening

1215
01:17:20,140 --> 01:17:21,220
You are reason for all this

1216
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:23,510
He’s constantly comparing 
with you and humiliating me

1217
01:17:23,630 --> 01:17:26,370
To get away from this humiliation I 
decided to go away from this place

1218
01:17:26,460 --> 01:17:27,940
But you won't let me do that either!

1219
01:17:59,290 --> 01:18:04,190
With my hands 
I capture the sky

1220
01:18:04,390 --> 01:18:09,500
When you look 
I fold my hands

1221
01:18:09,800 --> 01:18:14,870
I never call out my name

1222
01:18:15,020 --> 01:18:20,660
There’s not a day where I 
have not called out your name

1223
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:25,950
I should cross seven lives I 
should shoulder you every time

1224
01:18:26,150 --> 01:18:30,790
Even when I age, my eyes 
should search for you

1225
01:18:31,500 --> 01:18:36,610
When my life leaves the body 
Your face should come infront of me

1226
01:18:36,890 --> 01:18:41,590
Don’t leave my heart 
You are always in my thoughts

1227
01:18:43,570 --> 01:18:47,690
Muthaiya mentor, Nagarkoil 
small town Special tournament

1228
01:18:48,010 --> 01:18:49,740
Mathanda Marpor competition

1229
01:18:49,980 --> 01:18:50,920
What’s this?

1230
01:18:51,080 --> 01:18:54,580
Will you furnish copies of sports 
that you played on the streets?

1231
01:18:54,710 --> 01:18:56,020
Where’s your sports certificate?

1232
01:18:56,050 --> 01:18:57,450
Sir this is Adimurai

1233
01:18:57,660 --> 01:19:00,220
It’s our martial arts. It’s in 
existence for over one thousand years

1234
01:19:00,290 --> 01:19:01,690
I am learning it for over 12 years

1235
01:19:01,950 --> 01:19:03,370
My father was also a tutor

1236
01:19:03,540 --> 01:19:06,510
The branches of this are 
karate , Muay Thai

1237
01:19:06,630 --> 01:19:08,510
Did I ask you for the history?

1238
01:19:08,870 --> 01:19:09,950
- Amarnath 
- Sir

1239
01:19:10,090 --> 01:19:11,800
- How many years did you learn Karate for? 
- Three years

1240
01:19:11,910 --> 01:19:14,730
In three years he learnt 
karate and became a police

1241
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,320
Go and drink his ****

1242
01:19:17,100 --> 01:19:19,050
Like a crazy man learnt it for 12 years

1243
01:19:19,280 --> 01:19:21,530
Are you and father mad to have learnt it. 
Useless ****

1244
01:19:22,530 --> 01:19:23,880
Raising your hand with me

1245
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:26,190
Take this away!

1246
01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:28,120
Bringing in garbage like this

1247
01:19:28,240 --> 01:19:30,130
Is there a government 
recognition for all this ?

1248
01:19:31,460 --> 01:19:33,830
Sir I was telling you because 
you were unaware of it

1249
01:19:34,020 --> 01:19:36,290
Sir I can perform with skill

1250
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:38,650
Sir my mother is of hope that 
I will become a policeman

1251
01:19:38,720 --> 01:19:41,040
- I fall at your feet 
- Get lost

1252
01:19:42,250 --> 01:19:43,060
Please sir

1253
01:19:43,590 --> 01:19:45,580
Elango who learnt Adimurai from your father

1254
01:19:45,930 --> 01:19:48,630
Committed suicide as his police 
dream did not materialize

1255
01:19:48,900 --> 01:19:52,120
For our performers of 
Adimurai It was a huge shock

1256
01:19:55,410 --> 01:19:58,520
You used to always pamper him

1257
01:19:58,660 --> 01:20:00,870
I told you will get you a police uniform. 
Here have it

1258
01:20:01,660 --> 01:20:03,850
Next time I should see you in this uniform

1259
01:20:04,370 --> 01:20:07,920
See him with all the respect and garland

1260
01:20:07,990 --> 01:20:11,010
Did you buy the police uniform 
to see him in this state

1261
01:20:11,660 --> 01:20:14,240
You gave me hope that I will 
get my dream job ,Master

1262
01:20:14,500 --> 01:20:16,590
I only received humiliation and rejection

1263
01:20:16,680 --> 01:20:18,920
Several sports from other 
regions are recognized

1264
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:21,030
But the sport of our soil 
Adimurai is not recognized

1265
01:20:21,200 --> 01:20:22,620
This should not continue

1266
01:20:22,840 --> 01:20:25,430
You should take care of those 
dependent on Adimurai my master

1267
01:20:26,210 --> 01:20:27,450
Good morning

1268
01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:28,710
Regarding the petition I gave

1269
01:20:28,810 --> 01:20:30,260
I read your petition

1270
01:20:30,310 --> 01:20:33,980
If the Government helps all those who 
learnt Adimurai will get jobs in schools

1271
01:20:34,060 --> 01:20:35,420
Many families will prosper

1272
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:37,370
It has to be handled by the minister

1273
01:20:37,400 --> 01:20:39,630
Sir, you had promised to talk 
about Adimurai in assembly

1274
01:20:39,790 --> 01:20:41,610
Assuming I talk in the Assembly about this

1275
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:45,170
The opposition party will 
ask what is Adimurai

1276
01:20:45,420 --> 01:20:47,440
See, even I am unaware of it

1277
01:20:48,150 --> 01:20:50,940
See, pertaining to this 
you prepare a report

1278
01:20:51,070 --> 01:20:53,630
Of all involved,some videos and some papers

1279
01:20:53,700 --> 01:20:55,280
Then will take this to the government

1280
01:20:55,330 --> 01:20:58,810
To gain government recognition, 
we decided to do all they asked for

1281
01:20:59,230 --> 01:21:01,230
For Adimurai we built a community

1282
01:21:04,590 --> 01:21:06,630
This community is not just my dream

1283
01:21:06,690 --> 01:21:10,520
Having learnt the craft of Adimurai 
and waiting the government approval

1284
01:21:10,540 --> 01:21:11,600
It’s the dream of 
all those in pain

1285
01:21:11,710 --> 01:21:13,500
We can lose our wealth and materials

1286
01:21:14,060 --> 01:21:15,570
We should not lose our identity

1287
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:20,070
We aped the western and wore pants 
and shirt. That’s not a mistake

1288
01:21:20,380 --> 01:21:23,560
For that we should not degrade those 
wearing our traditional attire

1289
01:21:23,680 --> 01:21:27,040
In the name of modernity we are 
forgetting our traditions and customs

1290
01:21:27,330 --> 01:21:31,610
If we continue this we will have to see 
our traditional millets in showcase boxes

1291
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:35,130
What’s good for us, 
our soil knows

1292
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:38,450
Isn’t it our responsibility to 
preserve the pride of this soil

1293
01:21:38,660 --> 01:21:41,640
And we should take it 
to the next generation

1294
01:21:42,240 --> 01:21:45,820
To teach the world the pride of warriors 
our ancestors built the Kamdalur salai

1295
01:21:47,910 --> 01:21:51,080
To teach the world the pride of 
Adimurai is this institution

1296
01:21:53,430 --> 01:21:55,150
( instructing with the phrases of Adimurai)

1297
01:21:57,380 --> 01:22:00,240
Just as we were preparing for 
the government authorization

1298
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:04,170
Nilaparai returned home after 
five years with foreigners

1299
01:22:14,460 --> 01:22:18,190
Oh my! You have almost 
become a foreigner

1300
01:22:18,290 --> 01:22:19,820
These people came with you?

1301
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:22,080
Yes they have come 
here asking us a favor

1302
01:22:22,570 --> 01:22:24,000
- Will tell you later 
- Okay

1303
01:22:24,730 --> 01:22:25,450
This is Catherine

1304
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:27,560
- My wife 
- Greetings sister. Yes, you told me over phone

1305
01:22:27,950 --> 01:22:29,440
My son Richard

1306
01:22:29,670 --> 01:22:32,240
Richard, can’t you 
give him a Tamil name?

1307
01:22:32,350 --> 01:22:33,740
This is also nice. Come

1308
01:22:33,880 --> 01:22:36,290
Diraveyam , this is Edward, 
Catherine’s brother

1309
01:22:36,350 --> 01:22:37,080
Fine

1310
01:22:37,500 --> 01:22:40,590
For sometime I was in Madras. Samuel 
father’s son went to Italy to be a pastor

1311
01:22:40,720 --> 01:22:42,710
I went with him and learnt it there

1312
01:22:42,760 --> 01:22:43,990
In five years?

1313
01:22:44,830 --> 01:22:45,330
Yes

1314
01:22:46,220 --> 01:22:47,480
This is called kickboxing

1315
01:22:48,380 --> 01:22:51,100
To explain in your parlance, 
it’s like wresting here

1316
01:22:51,740 --> 01:22:53,340
But it’s world famous

1317
01:22:53,640 --> 01:22:55,000
I am a champion in this

1318
01:22:56,280 --> 01:22:57,150
Happy for you

1319
01:22:57,210 --> 01:22:58,780
There’s something else within you

1320
01:22:58,890 --> 01:23:02,410
Our master did not understand that

1321
01:23:02,830 --> 01:23:04,920
All your companions do the same?

1322
01:23:05,160 --> 01:23:06,250
- Yes 
- Nice

1323
01:23:06,300 --> 01:23:08,490
I want to start a 
kickboxing school pan India

1324
01:23:08,790 --> 01:23:10,290
Got permission from the government

1325
01:23:10,770 --> 01:23:11,790
Then I remembered you

1326
01:23:12,340 --> 01:23:17,390
Those who know Adimurai like you 
will learn kickboxing quickly

1327
01:23:17,640 --> 01:23:21,240
If you come as tutors for the academy, 
we can mint money

1328
01:23:21,680 --> 01:23:22,490
What do you say?

1329
01:23:23,700 --> 01:23:24,620
What are you thinking?

1330
01:23:28,300 --> 01:23:28,890
Will tell you

1331
01:23:37,500 --> 01:23:39,640
What are you wondering? 
Come in, I'll explain

1332
01:23:41,410 --> 01:23:43,330
Pinnal Nilai pose. Remember?

1333
01:23:43,620 --> 01:23:44,690
My favorite

1334
01:23:48,950 --> 01:23:50,670
- What's that? 
- The doll I made

1335
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:52,570
Our pride

1336
01:23:53,140 --> 01:23:54,350
- Here 
- No, thanks

1337
01:23:54,890 --> 01:23:57,290
Coconut water. Very hot; body cool

1338
01:23:57,850 --> 01:24:00,520
There are 1200 students 
studying under us

1339
01:24:00,860 --> 01:24:02,460
This is master's favorite section

1340
01:24:02,710 --> 01:24:04,420
At times, he sleeps here

1341
01:24:09,450 --> 01:24:11,460
How’s our institution?

1342
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:12,990
You wanted me to know why 
I was silent in the car

1343
01:24:13,130 --> 01:24:13,850
See that?

1344
01:24:13,980 --> 01:24:15,420
You have made my task easier

1345
01:24:18,950 --> 01:24:20,700
With just some small alterations

1346
01:24:21,800 --> 01:24:22,640
A ring set up there

1347
01:24:22,850 --> 01:24:25,130
A kickboxing storeroom, 
an office there

1348
01:24:25,570 --> 01:24:28,510
In three months this will become 
the main academy for India

1349
01:24:30,180 --> 01:24:31,440
Can earn in crores

1350
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:32,340
Then...

1351
01:24:33,430 --> 01:24:34,440
I will be Number 1

1352
01:24:34,830 --> 01:24:37,150
You should be the next in line 
and take care of everything

1353
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,400
Hey. Respond

1354
01:24:48,330 --> 01:24:50,380
As a friend I can give you my life

1355
01:24:51,120 --> 01:24:51,780
But...

1356
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:54,300
what you’re asking for is above my life

1357
01:24:54,380 --> 01:24:55,800
Hey sorry

1358
01:24:56,170 --> 01:24:58,680
I just felt like asking

1359
01:24:59,110 --> 01:25:00,700
Fine. I will leave

1360
01:25:00,900 --> 01:25:02,160
When our place is here, 
where do you want to go?

1361
01:25:02,160 --> 01:25:04,610
I came here only to gather 
people for kickboxing

1362
01:25:04,700 --> 01:25:06,870
I don’t think it will be appropriate

1363
01:25:06,900 --> 01:25:08,160
Gather good people

1364
01:25:08,680 --> 01:25:09,850
Why do you think otherwise?

1365
01:25:09,960 --> 01:25:12,390
Whatever suits you do it. 
Stay back here and do it

1366
01:25:12,530 --> 01:25:16,150
I will do all that you 
and your partners need

1367
01:25:26,680 --> 01:25:27,500
Saw this?

1368
01:25:28,380 --> 01:25:28,880
Van Damme

1369
01:25:29,090 --> 01:25:30,870
Today he’s the world’s greatest action hero

1370
01:25:31,030 --> 01:25:32,340
How is the fight in the movie?

1371
01:25:32,390 --> 01:25:33,120
Super

1372
01:25:33,280 --> 01:25:34,900
Do you know the name of this fight?

1373
01:25:35,370 --> 01:25:36,370
Kickboxing

1374
01:25:36,990 --> 01:25:38,420
This is the world’s leading sport

1375
01:25:39,410 --> 01:25:42,590
Just say it’s popular 
don’t say it’s the best

1376
01:25:43,730 --> 01:25:45,690
Is it even a sport when 
you shield your hands?

1377
01:25:45,960 --> 01:25:47,550
Our Adimurai is no way inferior

1378
01:25:47,920 --> 01:25:51,010
Which one? After learning for 12 years 
You all fight with hunger and poverty

1379
01:25:51,060 --> 01:25:52,620
Is that what you’re talking about. 
Look at me

1380
01:25:52,690 --> 01:25:55,000
I went out. After five years 
see how I have come back

1381
01:25:55,170 --> 01:25:57,950
This is not just a fight. 
It’s a money spinner

1382
01:25:59,200 --> 01:26:01,820
To sell yourself for money 
is not bravery

1383
01:26:07,970 --> 01:26:10,930
If what you have learnt is 
superior, can we fight one on one?

1384
01:26:11,680 --> 01:26:13,630
I am ready. 
Are you ready?

1385
01:26:15,580 --> 01:26:18,430
- We will never fight with **** woman 
- What?

1386
01:26:18,510 --> 01:26:20,350
He’s using foul language with our sister

1387
01:26:20,390 --> 01:26:20,890
What?

1388
01:26:21,350 --> 01:26:22,520
How dare you?

1389
01:26:22,870 --> 01:26:23,580
Muruga!

1390
01:26:24,680 --> 01:26:25,740
Was it a good punch?

1391
01:26:25,860 --> 01:26:28,320
What’s this? Getting into 
trouble with the host?

1392
01:26:29,330 --> 01:26:30,110
Look here

1393
01:26:30,440 --> 01:26:33,590
If you and your companions have 
to leave this place alive

1394
01:26:33,780 --> 01:26:35,500
Ask him to fall at his feet and apologize

1395
01:26:36,290 --> 01:26:37,000
What's he saying?

1396
01:26:37,090 --> 01:26:38,740
He’s asking you to say sorry and leave

1397
01:26:41,330 --> 01:26:42,460
I never ask sorry

1398
01:26:42,770 --> 01:26:45,940
If you want and if 
you’re able hit me back

1399
01:26:46,130 --> 01:26:47,110
What’s he saying?

1400
01:26:47,460 --> 01:26:48,800
Asking you to hit if you can

1401
01:26:50,280 --> 01:26:52,280
Take these gloves. You're like a leper

1402
01:26:55,620 --> 01:26:58,360
It’s a broken hand, 
so wear a glove

1403
01:27:01,210 --> 01:27:02,180
What the hell was that?

1404
01:27:12,050 --> 01:27:14,230
That’s the palm cut

1405
01:27:14,720 --> 01:27:17,610
Can you give a befitting reply 
with your boxing to this

1406
01:27:18,840 --> 01:27:20,350
Punching a wall is not bravery

1407
01:27:20,920 --> 01:27:24,110
Show your bravery by 
fighting with me

1408
01:27:24,930 --> 01:27:25,990
Tell us when and where

1409
01:27:26,810 --> 01:27:27,990
He's there

1410
01:27:28,100 --> 01:27:29,480
Tomorrow here

1411
01:27:30,060 --> 01:27:32,620
Master, you are talking back with him?

1412
01:27:32,640 --> 01:27:33,760
We can talk tomorrow go

1413
01:27:34,060 --> 01:27:34,890
Scared?

1414
01:27:37,180 --> 01:27:40,660
Scared , not for 
me, it’s for you

1415
01:27:41,710 --> 01:27:43,460
My mentor did not teach me to lose

1416
01:27:43,700 --> 01:27:44,770
The fight is proof

1417
01:27:45,040 --> 01:27:45,540
What?

1418
01:27:46,250 --> 01:27:48,010
- He’s saying we can fight and prove 
- I understand that much

1419
01:27:48,280 --> 01:27:49,120
What can I do?

1420
01:27:49,260 --> 01:27:50,420
If he loses...

1421
01:27:51,350 --> 01:27:54,170
all your Adimurai people should 
learn kickboxing from me

1422
01:27:55,790 --> 01:27:57,780
Wait, Master is talking 
and you’re walking out

1423
01:27:58,680 --> 01:28:00,310
If he wins...

1424
01:28:00,460 --> 01:28:04,800
you and your team should fall on the 
feet of this young boy and seek pardon

1425
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:11,170
If we lose he’s asking 
us to fall on his feet

1426
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:14,370
Yes will do

1427
01:28:32,180 --> 01:28:33,500
The rules for this game

1428
01:28:33,560 --> 01:28:36,720
The principles of adimurai 
Kailpol, Salait, Eduthari, Malla...

1429
01:28:36,780 --> 01:28:38,800
and Pootupurivu techniques 
can be used for attacking

1430
01:28:38,860 --> 01:28:42,160
Under the rules of kickboxing Knee 
kick, front kick, rounder kick...

1431
01:28:42,430 --> 01:28:44,360
Front hook, back hook,spinning kick...

1432
01:28:44,500 --> 01:28:46,420
and all punches can 
be used for attacking

1433
01:28:46,420 --> 01:28:48,160
Each round is for three minutes

1434
01:28:48,270 --> 01:28:49,850
One minute rest will be given

1435
01:28:49,960 --> 01:28:55,140
The players in the arena is will considered 
defeated when they fall out of the arena

1436
01:28:56,440 --> 01:28:58,480
My dear! Even now its not late

1437
01:28:59,090 --> 01:29:02,350
If you join the foreigners and fall on the 
feet of the young lad, it'l be humiliating

1438
01:29:02,600 --> 01:29:03,290
Let’s shake hands

1439
01:29:04,140 --> 01:29:05,450
You think I am the old Nilapirai

1440
01:29:05,720 --> 01:29:08,230
Will you ask your guys to learn kickboxing?

1441
01:29:08,480 --> 01:29:09,620
Then we will shake hands

1442
01:29:12,170 --> 01:29:13,410
Round 1

1443
01:29:40,540 --> 01:29:41,410
Master, please sit

1444
01:29:56,730 --> 01:29:57,600
Drop him out

1445
01:30:31,460 --> 01:30:32,470
Drink some water

1446
01:30:36,320 --> 01:30:37,470
Round 2

1447
01:30:47,770 --> 01:30:51,250
Learnt to escape from the jungle

1448
01:30:51,590 --> 01:30:55,160
Will break all the handcuffs 
to save the pride of the clan

1449
01:30:55,760 --> 01:30:59,430
Will take up Adimurai to wage this war

1450
01:30:59,890 --> 01:31:03,040
Will play in this arena

1451
01:31:03,320 --> 01:31:06,750
This is the group that fed on bravery

1452
01:31:16,460 --> 01:31:17,300
What's that?

1453
01:31:17,510 --> 01:31:18,590
It’s a Pinal Nilai

1454
01:31:18,980 --> 01:31:20,860
If the Adimuari warrior comes to this state

1455
01:31:21,150 --> 01:31:23,090
The opponent cannot touch 
the Adimurai warrior

1456
01:31:39,910 --> 01:31:40,540
That’s the way

1457
01:31:42,500 --> 01:31:43,710
My hand

1458
01:31:43,950 --> 01:31:44,780
Leave it

1459
01:31:45,660 --> 01:31:47,200
My hand

1460
01:31:50,010 --> 01:31:51,370
My hand. Leave it

1461
01:32:17,340 --> 01:32:18,590
My leg

1462
01:32:28,900 --> 01:32:29,630
Diraveyam

1463
01:32:31,490 --> 01:32:33,200
Are you lenient because 
he’s your friend?

1464
01:32:34,140 --> 01:32:36,490
When you step into the arena, 
the opponent is your enemy

1465
01:32:36,740 --> 01:32:38,000
Your bonds should fly

1466
01:32:38,110 --> 01:32:40,710
The challenge is on the 
pride of your Mentor and...

1467
01:32:41,180 --> 01:32:43,530
What you consider is over your life. 
The art of Adimurai

1468
01:34:17,160 --> 01:34:19,500
The time is not up. They 
rang the bell before that

1469
01:34:21,340 --> 01:34:22,080
Look Master

1470
01:34:22,450 --> 01:34:23,840
Why did you ring the bell earlier?

1471
01:34:44,980 --> 01:34:46,070
Round 3

1472
01:35:02,590 --> 01:35:06,250
Learnt to escape from the jungle

1473
01:35:06,510 --> 01:35:10,380
Will break all the handcuffs 
to save the pride of the clan

1474
01:35:10,610 --> 01:35:14,330
Will take up Adimurai to wage this war

1475
01:35:14,560 --> 01:35:18,060
Will play in this arena

1476
01:35:18,910 --> 01:35:19,990
Hit me if you can

1477
01:35:53,530 --> 01:35:54,450
Look dears...

1478
01:35:54,770 --> 01:35:57,460
Diraveyam asked you not to 
fall at the young boy’s feet

1479
01:35:57,650 --> 01:35:58,800
His heart is like that

1480
01:35:59,110 --> 01:36:02,860
For that we cannot hold our 
celebrations of winning the foreigners

1481
01:36:03,020 --> 01:36:04,240
Let’s burst the crackers

1482
01:36:07,090 --> 01:36:08,730
Is the pride standing tall

1483
01:36:09,190 --> 01:36:10,680
Is it exploding

1484
01:36:10,980 --> 01:36:12,600
It is crackling 
Is you nerve wrenching

1485
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:14,680
Is the enemy shattered

1486
01:36:15,010 --> 01:36:16,690
Valor is our clan

1487
01:36:16,990 --> 01:36:18,800
To chase the tiger is our task

1488
01:36:19,020 --> 01:36:22,620
The blend of sympathy and pride 
is this hardcore Tamizhman

1489
01:36:38,740 --> 01:36:40,350
This beginning is new

1490
01:36:40,630 --> 01:36:42,310
This history is new

1491
01:36:42,620 --> 01:36:44,460
No mankind

1492
01:36:44,630 --> 01:36:46,920
Has touched our achievements

1493
01:36:46,980 --> 01:36:48,510
Even on the deathbed

1494
01:36:48,760 --> 01:36:50,440
The spear will tear our heart

1495
01:36:50,540 --> 01:36:54,910
The enemy’s sword has 
never seen our back

1496
01:36:54,970 --> 01:36:56,790
One thousand hands will tear you down

1497
01:36:56,820 --> 01:36:58,730
You lift your spirits high

1498
01:36:58,830 --> 01:37:00,750
The one who tries to tear you

1499
01:37:00,780 --> 01:37:02,530
Should bow down and give way

1500
01:37:02,960 --> 01:37:07,000
This soil gives everything 
It leads us to prosperity

1501
01:37:07,110 --> 01:37:10,750
With its loving hands 
Will embrace us

1502
01:37:10,810 --> 01:37:14,960
Until you shield us

1503
01:37:15,070 --> 01:37:18,310
Our soil will always be supreme

1504
01:37:18,370 --> 01:37:19,850
Hunt the evil

1505
01:37:22,340 --> 01:37:23,780
Show the game 
The game is ready

1506
01:37:26,220 --> 01:37:27,770
Take the whip

1507
01:37:30,320 --> 01:37:31,800
Bring down the fort

1508
01:37:32,480 --> 01:37:32,980
Come on

1509
01:38:07,310 --> 01:38:10,800
Arts thrive on this soil 
This is our God

1510
01:38:11,030 --> 01:38:14,960
We listed to the art 
We guarded our tradition

1511
01:38:15,230 --> 01:38:18,720
We fancied the West 
Got muddled with it

1512
01:38:19,010 --> 01:38:22,570
Somehow we suffered with that

1513
01:38:22,670 --> 01:38:26,940
If you lose your roots 
In some other path you will wilt

1514
01:38:27,180 --> 01:38:31,030
If you believe in yourself 
You will create a new path

1515
01:38:31,290 --> 01:38:35,070
If you have pride, swirl your mustache 
Will be the hand of a great fighter Kattaboman

1516
01:38:35,360 --> 01:38:39,040
If you have fire within 
You will be the headgear of Bharathi

1517
01:38:39,090 --> 01:38:42,940
This soil gives everything 
It leads us to prosperity

1518
01:38:43,120 --> 01:38:46,660
With its loving hands 
Will embrace us

1519

Come on

1542
01:39:52,790 --> 01:39:53,730
We need more space, master

1543
01:39:53,860 --> 01:39:56,930
If there is no enough space then open the 
weapons warehouse. Let them sleep there

1544
01:39:56,930 --> 01:39:58,250
Go, he’s asking you to leave

1545
01:39:58,300 --> 01:39:59,080
Diraveyam

1546
01:39:59,150 --> 01:39:59,650
Yes Master

1547
01:40:01,150 --> 01:40:02,830
The foreigners group has banished

1548
01:40:03,500 --> 01:40:05,690
Why is this useless fellow 
still hanging out here?

1549
01:40:06,130 --> 01:40:10,320
He has come after a long time. I told 
him to stay back for few more days

1550
01:40:10,950 --> 01:40:11,450
Listen

1551
01:40:12,520 --> 01:40:14,780
You have a heart of gold 
and asking him to stay

1552
01:40:16,510 --> 01:40:17,680
As a father I know

1553
01:40:18,440 --> 01:40:19,240
That’s venom

1554
01:40:20,900 --> 01:40:21,900
Don’t trust too much

1555
01:40:22,270 --> 01:40:22,770
Be careful

1556
01:40:25,460 --> 01:40:27,250
You are simply saying something

1557
01:40:27,840 --> 01:40:29,750
Don't you usally sleep here? 
Where are you off to, now?

1558
01:40:29,820 --> 01:40:32,570
I won't stayback where he stays

1559
01:40:47,140 --> 01:40:47,950
What is it?

1560
01:40:48,600 --> 01:40:50,120
What work do you have here now?

1561
01:40:50,190 --> 01:40:52,130
Is it necessary that you have meet 
that horrible friend of yours?

1562
01:40:52,160 --> 01:40:55,140
When you go to see your friend 
can’t I go to see mine?

1563
01:40:55,180 --> 01:40:55,970
That’s valid

1564
01:40:56,220 --> 01:40:58,740
She’s getting married and leaving to 
Ceylon. I don’t know when she will be back

1565
01:40:59,660 --> 01:41:00,670
Forgive me Father

1566
01:41:02,010 --> 01:41:03,120
The fault lies on me

1567
01:41:04,110 --> 01:41:05,000
What are you saying?

1568
01:41:05,260 --> 01:41:06,900
What I did not understand for 35 years

1569
01:41:07,110 --> 01:41:08,130
I understood now

1570
01:41:08,470 --> 01:41:09,210
Nilaparai

1571
01:41:09,280 --> 01:41:10,690
I should have listened to you

1572
01:41:10,860 --> 01:41:12,650
No it’s dark

1573
01:41:12,680 --> 01:41:15,300
I should be sleeping alone, I will be 
scared. Aren’t you worried about all this?

1574
01:41:15,360 --> 01:41:17,930
If you are home, then you'll fight 
with the ghosts and save me

1575
01:41:17,930 --> 01:41:18,430
What?

1576
01:41:18,880 --> 01:41:19,530
What?

1577
01:41:24,790 --> 01:41:26,630
It’s for your good dear

1578
01:41:26,880 --> 01:41:28,000
Even this happiness...

1579
01:41:35,690 --> 01:41:37,850
How many times I was 
humiliated because of you

1580
01:41:38,880 --> 01:41:42,620
Those who have learnt Adimurai 
are alert even when they sleep

1581
01:41:43,080 --> 01:41:44,760
You can’t be killed through valor

1582
01:41:45,190 --> 01:41:47,630
Only through venom can we kill you. Die!

1583
01:41:50,330 --> 01:41:51,000
Give

1584
01:41:51,940 --> 01:41:55,480
I'll feel lonely without you, which is why 
I held your hand. How else do I put it?

1585
01:41:55,630 --> 01:41:57,030
Just one day, right

1586
01:41:57,220 --> 01:42:00,200
Oh is it? Hands off me! Hands off me!

1587
01:42:00,410 --> 01:42:01,970
Is that why you're holding my hand?

1588
01:42:24,940 --> 01:42:26,100
What are you staring at?

1589
01:42:26,370 --> 01:42:27,060
Aren’t you hungry?

1590
01:42:27,180 --> 01:42:27,680
Well...

1591
01:42:28,340 --> 01:42:31,370
My stomach hurts. Eating here after a 
long gap,the food is not suiting me

1592
01:42:31,550 --> 01:42:33,220
I will have bread

1593
01:42:34,070 --> 01:42:36,320
You say the food our soil is not suiting you

1594
01:42:36,540 --> 01:42:37,040
Not bad

1595
01:42:37,460 --> 01:42:38,980
Come I will also eat bread with you

1596
01:42:39,070 --> 01:42:39,700
Come let’s go

1597
01:42:42,880 --> 01:42:44,370
I am starving let’s go

1598
01:42:48,760 --> 01:42:50,070
Why are you sweating so much?

1599
01:42:51,370 --> 01:42:52,790
It’s very sultry

1600
01:42:53,100 --> 01:42:55,020
It's very sultry? Sister...

1601
01:42:55,630 --> 01:42:58,140
during childhood, we used 
to play together the whole day

1602
01:42:58,300 --> 01:42:59,980
No sweating then. 
Now he’s sweating

1603
01:43:00,300 --> 01:43:00,800
Is it?

1604
01:43:08,860 --> 01:43:12,280
I feel uneasy let me go 
see Master and come

1605
01:43:13,870 --> 01:43:14,940
At this hour?

1606
01:43:15,250 --> 01:43:17,750
Morning we are going for the 
feast, we will talk then

1607
01:43:18,960 --> 01:43:20,100
Yes we are going

1608
01:43:22,960 --> 01:43:24,240
Fine eat

1609
01:43:26,360 --> 01:43:28,270
Morning we have training sleep well

1610
01:43:28,470 --> 01:43:30,150
- Close the door there 
- Okay master

1611
01:44:08,690 --> 01:44:10,580
Come on, let's go! Go!

1612
01:44:13,300 --> 01:44:15,170
Come. Move fast

1613
01:44:15,540 --> 01:44:16,170
Get my son

1614
01:44:16,750 --> 01:44:17,970
Take her. Come

1615
01:44:18,270 --> 01:44:19,120
Go. Go

1616
01:44:26,450 --> 01:44:27,500
- Take care of him 
- Ok. Ok

1617
01:44:51,060 --> 01:44:52,700
Hey! Who locked this door from outside?

1618
01:45:23,040 --> 01:45:25,900
They had poisoned the food

1619
01:45:26,380 --> 01:45:29,200
The children are battling for life

1620
01:45:38,560 --> 01:45:39,110
Angalam?

1621
01:45:39,640 --> 01:45:41,130
Hey! Hey Angalam!

1622
01:45:41,230 --> 01:45:41,730
Angalam!

1623
01:45:41,920 --> 01:45:43,800
Master, look at him

1624
01:46:55,730 --> 01:46:59,600
You always said, ask me 
whatever I have will give it

1625
01:47:00,860 --> 01:47:03,800
To avenge the humiliation I 
faced, give me your life

1626
01:47:06,910 --> 01:47:08,930
Master told me you are a venom

1627
01:47:09,960 --> 01:47:10,910
I didn’t believe it

1628
01:47:14,880 --> 01:47:17,010
I just came out after killing him

1629
01:47:19,720 --> 01:47:23,730
He, you, both your Adimurai...

1630
01:47:26,110 --> 01:47:28,350
will be buried in the soil forever

1631
01:48:52,600 --> 01:48:53,730
Kanya!

1632
01:48:55,380 --> 01:48:56,460
Go away

1633
01:49:00,020 --> 01:49:00,730
Go

1634
01:49:01,050 --> 01:49:01,870
God!

1635
01:49:08,950 --> 01:49:10,450
Kill her as well

1636
01:49:10,860 --> 01:49:12,240
Don't spare her son either

1637
01:49:12,350 --> 01:49:13,470
Kill that boy

1638
01:49:28,280 --> 01:49:28,920
Go

1639
01:49:29,420 --> 01:49:31,240
- Go from here 
- How did this happen?

1640
01:49:33,090 --> 01:49:35,160
Listen to me. 
Go away from here

1641
01:49:37,560 --> 01:49:38,360
Just go

1642
01:49:42,070 --> 01:49:42,860
I will take care

1643
01:49:43,660 --> 01:49:44,620
Take the child and leave

1644
01:49:44,970 --> 01:49:45,880
Sakthi

1645
01:49:47,850 --> 01:49:49,970
Go to some other place

1646
01:49:50,490 --> 01:49:51,670
Go. Listen to me

1647
01:49:53,400 --> 01:49:54,680
I'll follow

1648
01:51:42,680 --> 01:51:45,030
After I regained consciousness and saw

1649
01:51:45,150 --> 01:51:46,390
You were at their feet

1650
01:51:49,470 --> 01:51:51,360
The institution which was built 
with passion was tainted as

1651
01:51:51,540 --> 01:51:54,510
One that was built without 
proper permissions and there was

1652
01:51:54,650 --> 01:51:57,060
An electrical short circuit 
and it burnt the place down

1653
01:51:57,190 --> 01:51:58,980
Nilaparai easily closed 
the case on those grounds

1654
01:51:59,100 --> 01:52:02,410
My testimony that I killed Edward 
to safeguard you was not accepted

1655
01:52:02,590 --> 01:52:04,780
The police searched the entire 
forest and could not find you

1656
01:52:04,970 --> 01:52:06,270
My statements proved to be false

1657
01:52:06,410 --> 01:52:08,690
I was sentenced to life 
for killing a foreigner

1658
01:52:10,780 --> 01:52:12,850
I heard your mourning 
sound on the foothills

1659
01:52:13,470 --> 01:52:15,210
I carried you from there

1660
01:52:15,360 --> 01:52:16,970
For 6 months you could not speak

1661
01:52:17,210 --> 01:52:19,040
When someone called out 
Sakthi you responded

1662
01:52:19,120 --> 01:52:20,980
Only then I knew your name was Sakthi

1663
01:52:22,640 --> 01:52:23,940
Every day I was in jail

1664
01:52:24,050 --> 01:52:26,270
I searched out for every 
single information about him

1665
01:52:26,640 --> 01:52:28,570
As soon I was released I 
came there to kill him

1666
01:52:28,650 --> 01:52:29,780
It was there that I saw you

1667
01:52:29,870 --> 01:52:32,960
I also knew about the tournament 
MMA that he was going to organize

1668
01:52:33,250 --> 01:52:35,980
Our dreams that were shattered, 
I decided to revive it

1669
01:52:36,080 --> 01:52:37,660
You should participate in MMA

1670
01:52:38,200 --> 01:52:40,620
You should show the world what’s Adimurai

1671
01:52:41,020 --> 01:52:42,620
Till then I will be your Mentor

1672
01:52:45,230 --> 01:52:45,910
Hey, Firework

1673
01:52:46,600 --> 01:52:48,380
Where are you both? Can’t find you?

1674
01:52:48,480 --> 01:52:51,610
As mother said, winning this 
tournament is secondary

1675
01:52:51,710 --> 01:52:54,450
Killing him and laying his head on my 
mother’s feet will be justice served

1676
01:52:54,460 --> 01:52:54,860
Listen!

1677
01:52:54,860 --> 01:52:56,020
I got hold of his car

1678
01:52:56,360 --> 01:52:57,450
The driver is with Puncture

1679
01:52:57,950 --> 01:52:59,900
After drinking you should eat

1680
01:52:59,970 --> 01:53:01,990
I am going to pick him up at the airport

1681
01:53:02,050 --> 01:53:03,530
Don’t do anything

1682
01:53:11,400 --> 01:53:13,900
Nilan, the date remains the same, right?

1683
01:53:14,230 --> 01:53:17,250
Yes Ganga, as fixed MMA 
will happen in 3 months

1684
01:53:17,410 --> 01:53:18,520
Do you know who came?

1685
01:53:18,680 --> 01:53:21,230
I enquired well. Its Diraveyum’s son Sakthi

1686
01:53:21,440 --> 01:53:22,880
I thought he was dead

1687
01:53:24,260 --> 01:53:27,120
All the leftovers are after my life

1688
01:53:27,460 --> 01:53:31,170
If I had left his corpse they would have 
celebrated and worshipped him after death

1689
01:53:31,280 --> 01:53:32,510
That’s why I burnt him to ashes

1690
01:53:32,590 --> 01:53:36,290
Now because of the same form 
and fire I am having trouble

1691
01:53:36,420 --> 01:53:38,070
Another thing 
He’s a thief

1692
01:53:38,510 --> 01:53:39,010
What?

1693
01:53:39,090 --> 01:53:41,960
They have seen him nab 
the bag from that lady

1694
01:53:42,110 --> 01:53:43,510
Diraveyum’s son is a thief?

1695
01:53:47,840 --> 01:53:49,420
It’s delightful to hear this

1696
01:53:49,580 --> 01:53:51,720
Unnecessarily I killed my father

1697
01:53:52,760 --> 01:53:54,330
Had he been alive now

1698
01:53:54,370 --> 01:53:58,830
I would have asked him to look 
at the state of Diraveyum’s son

1699
01:54:01,730 --> 01:54:04,880
If I die this second, 
I will die with joy

1700
01:54:08,380 --> 01:54:09,580
Who are you?

1701
01:54:10,860 --> 01:54:13,180
What are you up to? Where 
are you abducting me to?

1702
01:54:13,260 --> 01:54:15,620
Stop the car! Stop it! You idiot!

1703
01:54:26,420 --> 01:54:27,610
Who are you?

1704
01:54:30,010 --> 01:54:31,770
Have you seen me somewhere?

1705
01:54:32,090 --> 01:54:34,450
I came with the rage to kill you here

1706
01:54:35,300 --> 01:54:37,160
Only after you spoke I realized

1707
01:54:37,380 --> 01:54:38,820
What a big blunder I was about to commit

1708
01:54:38,910 --> 01:54:40,290
What my mother said was right

1709
01:54:40,840 --> 01:54:43,000
I will participate in the tournament 
that you are going to conduct

1710
01:54:43,390 --> 01:54:44,390
I will win over you

1711
01:54:45,510 --> 01:54:49,010
It’s not a pride to just add the 
father’s name as the last name

1712
01:54:49,240 --> 01:54:51,410
One should live up to that name

1713
01:54:51,720 --> 01:54:52,500
I will live up to it

1714
01:54:53,480 --> 01:54:53,980
My name is

1715
01:54:54,930 --> 01:54:55,580
Sakthi

1716
01:54:58,160 --> 01:55:00,050
Sakthi Diraveyaperumal

1717
01:55:00,110 --> 01:55:03,550
Come here to defeat me

1718
01:55:08,080 --> 01:55:11,160
I am coming alone, come and face me

1719
01:55:15,990 --> 01:55:18,530
Come here to defeat me

1720
01:55:18,630 --> 01:55:21,120
I am coming alone, come and face me

1721
01:55:21,400 --> 01:55:26,640
I am filled with rage

1722
01:55:28,370 --> 01:55:31,200
The technical head of MMA is 
the overall deciding authority

1723
01:55:31,430 --> 01:55:33,270
We are sending Sakthi’s application to him

1724
01:55:33,520 --> 01:55:35,920
These are remains from what was 
burnt down in our institution

1725
01:55:36,580 --> 01:55:38,420
Can you do the triangular sutra 
that you performed that day?

1726
01:55:38,560 --> 01:55:42,030
It’s momentary. It won’t 
come just like that

1727
01:55:42,130 --> 01:55:45,390
Even the mythological Abimanyu learnt 
charkayug partially In his mother’s womb

1728
01:55:45,570 --> 01:55:47,200
We have thought you that fully

1729
01:55:47,510 --> 01:55:51,300
You should start with the 
primary step advance

1730
01:55:51,550 --> 01:55:53,570
further, reach the zenith 
and then stand firm

1731
01:56:15,080 --> 01:56:15,580
Master

1732
01:56:16,050 --> 01:56:19,020
In the MMA tournament we are going 
to conduct, representing Adimurai...

1733
01:56:19,070 --> 01:56:21,020
Sakthi Diraviyaperumal will be taking part. 
Do the necessary formalities

1734
01:56:21,250 --> 01:56:23,160
It is a sign of respect 
from me towards Adimurai

1735
01:56:23,450 --> 01:56:24,210
Okay Master

1736
01:56:24,330 --> 01:56:25,140
It’s my pleasure

1737
01:56:28,010 --> 01:56:30,090
I was wondering how he will enter

1738
01:56:32,770 --> 01:56:33,820
Someone is helping him

1739
01:56:35,330 --> 01:56:37,360
Let him come. If we finish 
him outside, it’s a murder

1740
01:56:37,800 --> 01:56:39,450
If we finish him within the cage, 
it’s a sport

1741
01:56:39,650 --> 01:56:40,370
Mettalian

1742
01:56:40,610 --> 01:56:41,700
He’s Mettalian

1743
01:56:41,870 --> 01:56:44,170
He was arrested on charges of 
drugs and is in Bangkok jail

1744
01:56:44,290 --> 01:56:46,110
He has told us to get him on bail

1745
01:56:46,400 --> 01:56:48,500
He has so far killed 6 
opponents in the cage

1746
01:56:48,920 --> 01:56:51,390
Nilan's plan is to finish off Sakthi

1747
01:56:54,790 --> 01:56:56,690
You found a job for one lakh a month

1748
01:56:56,750 --> 01:56:57,580
Why don’t you leave?

1749
01:56:57,780 --> 01:57:01,010
The job that you do for the ones 
you like is no parallel for money

1750
01:57:01,100 --> 01:57:01,980
Ones you like?

1751
01:57:03,070 --> 01:57:04,640
What's with that stare, Cylinder?

1752
01:57:05,010 --> 01:57:05,910
Rain's pouring down!

1753
01:57:06,080 --> 01:57:07,680
So you won't bathe tomorrow

1754
01:57:08,190 --> 01:57:09,470
Even in those times I was

1755
01:57:09,620 --> 01:57:10,680
His mother is coming

1756
01:57:11,560 --> 01:57:12,060
Stillness

1757
01:57:12,750 --> 01:57:13,560
Hand movement

1758
01:57:13,920 --> 01:57:14,740
Jump

1759
01:57:14,900 --> 01:57:15,740
Mother

1760
01:57:15,870 --> 01:57:16,700
Take a step back

1761
01:57:16,750 --> 01:57:18,450
Be alert. You can do all this later

1762
01:57:18,730 --> 01:57:20,010
Stop it now

1763
01:57:20,230 --> 01:57:21,460
She’s in no mood for all this

1764
01:57:26,630 --> 01:57:28,300
His techniques are fairly fine

1765
01:57:28,380 --> 01:57:30,350
He does not have the fire of his father

1766
01:57:30,680 --> 01:57:32,350
I don’t know his techniques

1767
01:57:32,490 --> 01:57:34,150
I can’t even remember in my dreams

1768
01:57:34,190 --> 01:57:35,800
How can I match his skills?

1769
01:57:36,240 --> 01:57:36,740
You can

1770
01:57:37,390 --> 01:57:39,580
Leader! Leader! Leader!

1771
01:57:40,060 --> 01:57:42,600
As the head hails high 
The nerves split in rage

1772
01:57:42,740 --> 01:57:46,350
As it enters the arena 
It manifests manifolds to valor

1773
01:57:46,370 --> 01:57:47,500
In the presence of yore

1774
01:57:47,570 --> 01:57:50,330
The evil will banish

1775
01:57:50,510 --> 01:57:54,640
As you enter all alone 
The time is right for you being your innings

1776
01:57:54,770 --> 01:57:58,620
The wicked foxes who tease you

1777
01:57:58,760 --> 01:58:01,360
Should be burnt to ashes with 
the fire from your forehead

1778
01:58:01,430 --> 01:58:04,000
The stage is waiting to see who will lose

1779
01:58:04,080 --> 01:58:06,640
The wounds will transform 
you to be a winner

1780
01:58:06,710 --> 01:58:09,300
To fall and rise is the nature of a warrior

1781
01:58:09,420 --> 01:58:11,960
There’s no end in a war

1782
01:58:12,080 --> 01:58:14,640
The stage is waiting to see who will lose

1783
01:58:14,770 --> 01:58:17,030
The wounds will transform 
you to be a winner

1784
01:58:17,410 --> 01:58:20,100
To fall and rise is the nature of a warrior

1785
01:58:20,280 --> 01:58:22,820
There’s no end in a war

1786
01:58:23,160 --> 01:58:26,600
In two weeks we have MMA match 
on behalf of Nilan academy

1787
01:58:26,790 --> 01:58:29,010
You should all reach it to the public

1788
01:58:29,290 --> 01:58:31,900
Come here to fight me

1789
01:58:31,990 --> 01:58:34,330
I am coming all alone. Come here

1790
01:58:34,710 --> 01:58:38,680
I am burning in rage. 
Come now

1791
01:58:39,890 --> 01:58:42,400
Come here to fight me

1792
01:58:42,700 --> 01:58:45,150
I am coming all alone. Come here

1793
01:58:45,340 --> 01:58:47,820
I am burning in rage 
Come now

1794
01:59:52,670 --> 01:59:57,600
To combat him for the first 
time Adimurai martial arts

1795
01:59:57,690 --> 02:00:00,100
Sakthi Diruveyaperumal

1796
02:00:13,860 --> 02:00:16,680
I thought you will die in prison 
I thought you won’t come

1797
02:00:16,760 --> 02:00:20,520
For the sword placed on my neck, 
I still have scores to settle Kanya

1798
02:00:22,840 --> 02:00:24,960
Your son’s death will avenge that

1799
02:00:25,730 --> 02:00:28,310
Nilaparai, treating Diraveyum 
as your enemy is your fault

1800
02:00:28,520 --> 02:00:31,470
Not considering Sakthi as 
your enemy is a bigger fault

1801
02:00:31,660 --> 02:00:34,710
Has your son fought in 
about 100 MMA matches?

1802
02:00:34,740 --> 02:00:35,880
Don’t pin hopes

1803
02:00:36,380 --> 02:00:40,210
Having tried for many years, 
I could not master Adimurai

1804
02:00:42,010 --> 02:00:43,660
Will he learn it in 3 months?

1805
02:00:43,860 --> 02:00:45,580
Adimurai is just an art that you learn

1806
02:00:46,320 --> 02:00:47,870
It’s his blood

1807
02:01:02,670 --> 02:01:04,310
Come on Sakthi

1808
02:01:05,040 --> 02:01:05,760
How bro?

1809
02:01:05,890 --> 02:01:07,580
It’s our Adimurai, won’t we know

1810
02:01:07,700 --> 02:01:08,610
We will win

1811
02:01:08,680 --> 02:01:10,110
- Which place are you from? 
- Keezhadi

1812
02:01:10,160 --> 02:01:11,590
Play as you like

1813
02:02:47,530 --> 02:02:48,230
Break him down!

1814
02:02:48,280 --> 02:02:48,780
Sakthi

1815
02:02:49,570 --> 02:02:52,160
Apply the technique and 
come to the lion form

1816
02:03:11,160 --> 02:03:11,660
Sakthi

1817
02:03:13,220 --> 02:03:14,610
Come out 
The game is over

1818
02:03:21,690 --> 02:03:24,910
Wow! Sakthi used his Adimurai technique...

1819
02:03:25,070 --> 02:03:31,510
and have knocked out Mettalian, 
whom nobody could knockout so far

1820
02:03:31,790 --> 02:03:33,890
The countdown is on, let's wait and watch

1821
02:03:39,620 --> 02:03:41,760
Adimurai

1822
02:03:53,440 --> 02:03:55,110
Cheer him up! Come on!

1823
02:04:03,030 --> 02:04:06,500
In the meantime during the chaos 
Mettalian attacked with iron rod

1824
02:04:06,630 --> 02:04:09,670
Its still unclear if he can 
compete in the next round

1825
02:04:09,910 --> 02:04:11,620
Only after the medical 
certification will it be clear

1826
02:04:11,630 --> 02:04:12,910
He has to take at least a week’s rest

1827
02:04:13,300 --> 02:04:14,770
He can’t play the next match

1828
02:04:15,510 --> 02:04:17,620
Doctor he has to play the next match

1829
02:04:17,700 --> 02:04:19,730
With just his left hand 
how can he play the match

1830
02:04:19,800 --> 02:04:23,520
Look for our F2F committee 
we have certain norms

1831
02:04:23,990 --> 02:04:25,810
I can’t give a fitness certificate

1832
02:04:27,330 --> 02:04:29,750
As a foster partner I am fretting. 
How can you be like this?

1833
02:04:32,380 --> 02:04:35,340
I accidentally brought 
them up as thieves

1834
02:04:35,960 --> 02:04:38,980
Till date the police have not hit them

1835
02:04:39,540 --> 02:04:41,380
I always shield them

1836
02:04:42,360 --> 02:04:43,710
I took such care of them

1837
02:04:44,380 --> 02:04:46,510
You want to send him to 
fight with a broken hand!

1838
02:04:48,140 --> 02:04:49,370
He will play the next match

1839
02:04:52,950 --> 02:04:54,210
The emotions are running high!

1840
02:04:54,440 --> 02:04:55,500
Give him the certificate

1841
02:04:56,220 --> 02:04:57,130
Let him come and play

1842
02:04:59,260 --> 02:05:04,470
Puncture that Mettalian who 
broke my son’s hand, I will...

1843
02:05:04,670 --> 02:05:06,490
Does that broken hand hurt?

1844
02:05:07,530 --> 02:05:08,310
Does it hurt a lot?

1845
02:05:08,340 --> 02:05:10,190
For onlookers like us it hurts. 
Won’t it pain for him?

1846
02:05:10,620 --> 02:05:11,120
Correct

1847
02:05:11,900 --> 02:05:13,740
Just have a peg a sleep

1848
02:05:13,930 --> 02:05:17,410
You will wake up brisk and see 
how you spin in the morning

1849
02:05:18,290 --> 02:05:19,480
Wait dear, pour it

1850
02:05:19,820 --> 02:05:20,740
I am having

1851
02:05:20,890 --> 02:05:22,560
Not for you for him

1852
02:05:22,940 --> 02:05:23,440
Mentor

1853
02:05:23,930 --> 02:05:25,460
That old man with the beard?

1854
02:05:25,520 --> 02:05:30,060
Looking at him I can say with a pinch 
of pickle he can have a full bottle

1855
02:05:30,300 --> 02:05:32,600
Just treat is as a medicine and have it

1856
02:05:32,670 --> 02:05:34,520
When you were a kid, I 
used to give this...

1857
02:05:34,630 --> 02:05:35,710
I was making him practicing

1858
02:05:36,790 --> 02:05:38,430
You call your mother as Mentor

1859
02:05:38,940 --> 02:05:42,770
What fault did our Firework do that she’s 
hanging him upside down and training him

1860
02:05:42,820 --> 02:05:45,610
You drunkard. We are 
hanging upside down

1861
02:05:45,650 --> 02:05:46,710
What?

1862
02:05:47,430 --> 02:05:48,420
Oh my

1863
02:05:48,530 --> 02:05:50,810
My liquor will now flow through my nose

1864
02:06:32,840 --> 02:06:34,460
Yes this is ambidextrous

1865
02:06:37,690 --> 02:06:40,140
He has the same power as his 
right hand on his left hand

1866
02:06:41,060 --> 02:06:43,180
It shows the same power 
on both hands for you

1867
02:07:22,820 --> 02:07:25,240
Sakthi has advanced to the semi-finals

1868
02:07:25,280 --> 02:07:26,830
He will face

1869
02:07:26,860 --> 02:07:29,750
Undefeated champion, Richard Nilan

1870
02:07:31,100 --> 02:07:34,200
Richard wait for the right time to 
hit continuously on his right hand

1871
02:07:34,330 --> 02:07:35,310
And punch his collar

1872
02:07:36,750 --> 02:07:38,040
This is to be our game plan

1873
02:07:38,210 --> 02:07:39,000
Rabbit punch

1874
02:07:39,150 --> 02:07:40,200
It’s unethical

1875
02:07:40,510 --> 02:07:41,940
Sorry dad. Its against the sport

1876
02:07:42,010 --> 02:07:44,080
The man who killed our 
academy guys, Mettalin

1877
02:07:44,100 --> 02:07:45,750
It’s a huge mistake that 
you brought him back

1878
02:07:45,830 --> 02:07:47,780
Now you are asking me 
to do the same mistake

1879
02:07:50,410 --> 02:07:52,060
You can win him right?

1880
02:07:53,070 --> 02:07:53,850
Go do that

1881
02:08:03,120 --> 02:08:03,820
Tell me Sadhana

1882
02:08:03,910 --> 02:08:06,340
Through Richard, Nilan has 
planned to hit you on the neck

1883
02:08:06,410 --> 02:08:08,840
Through a rabbit punch and kill 
you right there in the cage

1884
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:10,020
And one more thing

1885
02:08:11,620 --> 02:08:12,120
Tell me

1886
02:08:13,080 --> 02:08:13,880
Hello, Sadhana

1887
02:08:14,560 --> 02:08:15,410
I can’t hear properly

1888
02:08:17,380 --> 02:08:17,880
Hello

1889
02:08:19,630 --> 02:08:21,100
Sakthi it’s time for the match

1890
02:08:21,720 --> 02:08:23,000
Ask her what it is?

1891
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:28,500
Bro...

1892
02:08:28,990 --> 02:08:32,120
They have hit Sadhana 
and broke her face

1893
02:08:33,950 --> 02:08:34,790
Just a minute

1894
02:08:37,010 --> 02:08:38,170
Hey what happened?

1895
02:08:38,330 --> 02:08:39,310
He found out

1896
02:08:40,680 --> 02:08:44,930
He has asked his son to use 
unethical ways to hit you

1897
02:08:45,490 --> 02:08:46,240
Watch out

1898
02:08:53,630 --> 02:08:54,560
All the best

1899
02:09:01,770 --> 02:09:06,710
Former champion Richard 
Nilan has given a walk over

1900
02:09:06,830 --> 02:09:10,740
So Sakthi Diraveyaperumall 
goes to the finals

1901
02:09:19,130 --> 02:09:20,980
Sakthi , don’t lose your composure in anger

1902
02:09:21,080 --> 02:09:23,370
Let the final match get over. We will see

1903
02:09:25,860 --> 02:09:28,560
What Kanya? Are you scared 
something will happen to your son?

1904
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:32,690
What dear? Hiding behind the 
back is called Adimurai?

1905
02:09:34,430 --> 02:09:36,010
Is this what your mother taught you?

1906
02:09:38,310 --> 02:09:39,910
I would have let him if he was in anger

1907
02:09:40,820 --> 02:09:42,080
He is after your life

1908
02:09:42,160 --> 02:09:42,660
Get lost

1909
02:09:44,770 --> 02:09:45,270
Who?

1910
02:09:47,190 --> 02:09:47,690
He?

1911
02:09:49,640 --> 02:09:50,610
Will he kill me?

1912
02:09:51,650 --> 02:09:52,710
Come hit me

1913
02:09:53,660 --> 02:09:54,380
Hit me

1914
02:09:55,190 --> 02:09:57,430
Can we have an agreement fight?

1915
02:09:57,570 --> 02:09:58,430
Right here?

1916
02:10:02,780 --> 02:10:05,870
Even if you walk away now 
Tomorrow you will be disqualified

1917
02:10:06,090 --> 02:10:07,710
I will say that you threatened my son...

1918
02:10:07,970 --> 02:10:09,400
and got a walk over

1919
02:10:09,600 --> 02:10:13,010
He won’t be alive to testify it’s false

1920
02:10:13,330 --> 02:10:15,260
For the pride I have killed my father

1921
02:10:15,640 --> 02:10:19,060
Is it your father’s blood in your body? 
I am doubtful of that

1922
02:10:27,490 --> 02:10:30,200
Sakthi today your fight is not inside

1923
02:10:30,780 --> 02:10:31,280
It’s outside

1924
02:10:31,470 --> 02:10:33,110
If you stare at me 
I will burn you down

1925
02:10:33,200 --> 02:10:35,790
If you think of touching me 
I will break you to pieces

1926
02:10:35,860 --> 02:10:39,040
Are you ready to face me alone 
I am ready to come alone

1927
02:10:39,160 --> 02:10:40,540
Inform your near and dear ones

1928
02:15:44,540 --> 02:15:45,280
My hand!

1929
02:16:25,260 --> 02:16:26,930
It’s my father’s blood

1930
02:16:28,790 --> 02:16:29,290
Get lost

1931
02:16:30,500 --> 02:16:34,660
There is no link between the 
agreement fight and MMA

1932
02:16:34,720 --> 02:16:36,590
Sakthi Diraveyaperumal 
can fight in the finals

1933
02:16:54,410 --> 02:16:57,270
Our new cage warrior champion

1934
02:16:57,360 --> 02:17:00,380
The undefeated Sakthi Diraveyaperumal

1935
02:17:00,450 --> 02:17:03,640
Me participating in this game 
Is beyond winning and losing

1936
02:17:04,950 --> 02:17:06,100
There’s something more 
important behind this

1937
02:17:06,170 --> 02:17:06,910
Usually...

1938
02:17:07,770 --> 02:17:10,260
there are parents who 
fulfill the child’s dream

1939
02:17:11,030 --> 02:17:15,400
I stand here as a privileged son 
who can fulfill the parents dream

1940
02:17:16,840 --> 02:17:18,430
My father’s name if Diraveyaperumall

1941
02:17:21,050 --> 02:17:26,590
He scarified his life to promote and preserve 
our traditional practice of Adimurai

1942
02:17:28,350 --> 02:17:33,160
His dream was to reach 
this Adimurai to everyone

1943
02:17:35,680 --> 02:17:38,070
Now my mother’s dream is also the same

1944
02:17:40,150 --> 02:17:41,550
Beside Adimurai...

1945
02:17:42,910 --> 02:17:47,050
we should not forget the pride, 
culture and purity of this soil...

1946
02:17:47,770 --> 02:17:49,780
in the name of being civilized

1947
02:17:50,620 --> 02:17:52,750
We should ensure the next 
generation is well aware of this

1948
02:17:52,860 --> 02:17:54,400
That's all. Thanks

1949
02:17:54,460 --> 02:17:56,630
My mom is my mentor. Big thanks to her

1950
02:17:56,690 --> 02:17:58,370
Stop talking about my dream. 
What is your dream?

1951
02:17:59,920 --> 02:18:01,570
Now there’s a person called Bruce lee

1952
02:18:01,900 --> 02:18:04,760
Who has promoted his country sport 
Kung fu by acting in few movies and

1953
02:18:04,790 --> 02:18:06,800
promoted it to the world

1954
02:18:07,190 --> 02:18:08,320
What a big achievement

1955
02:18:08,680 --> 02:18:10,640
Like him, if not to the whole world

1956
02:18:11,130 --> 02:18:14,530
At least the people of Tamilnadu 
should know about Adimurai

1957
02:18:14,650 --> 02:18:15,790
That will give me happiness

1958
02:18:15,900 --> 02:18:16,920
That's my dream

1959
02:18:18,390 --> 02:18:20,670
Adimurai, the Tamil martial art...

1960
02:18:20,740 --> 02:18:26,210
is being considered to be recognized as a 
sport by the Tamil Nadu sports ministry

1961
02:18:26,680 --> 02:18:31,320
Sakthi Diraveyaperumall's speech after 
winning the MMA competition in Chennai...

1962
02:18:31,420 --> 02:18:37,000
is considered to be the starting 
point for recognizing Adimurai
