1
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:15,750
Reimbursement certificate
is with the bill.

2
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:19,120
Tell your clerk
to file it soon.

3
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:21,290
Otherwise, it will
remain there.

4
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:23,660
Shall we go?

5
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,950
Yeah.

6
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,540
Oh, there is a bag too?

7
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:38,700
Hey, Rajan.

8
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:46,410
If you want to laugh,
do it before we leave.

9
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,450
What the...

10
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:52,910
Look at you!

11
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:54,790
Playing the batman!

12
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,080
Funny.

13
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:58,450
It's pouring like crazy...

14
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:13,870
Hey, take this.

15
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,200
I'll make a move.

16
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,620
I have leave
only till afternoon.

17
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:17,870
Got one more hour of class today.

18
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:19,040
Okay then.

19
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:22,790
Don't hesitate to call me or Shalini
if you need something.

20
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:24,950
No pretensions.

21
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,120
Carry on, sir.

22
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:28,120
Go and teach the kids something.

23
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,330
Listen, Baby...

24
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,660
Don't pull that thing
off your face.

25
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:38,660
Wait till your nose is
back in shape.

26
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,830
Scram.

27
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,830
Or I'll seize your dumb car and put you
behind the bars under Section 184.

28
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:44,040
Sure, you will.

29
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:13,000
'Nizhal'
[Shadow]

30
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:39,830
Baby...

31
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,500
Can you see me?

32
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:43,330
I can't see you...

33
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:46,040
Dear Kathri...
Kathrina...

34
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:46,660
Yeah?

35
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,040
Please fix this for me.

36
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:51,870
Mom...

37
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,370
Internet connection is poor here.

38
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:54,700
It's raining heavily.

39
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:57,040
Uncle's camera is switched off.
That's why.

40
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,410
Thundershowers,
it seems.

41
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:05,450
Son, I'll start from here
on the 17th.

42
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:07,790
I'll be there by
early morning on 18th.

43
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:09,290
Baby...

44
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:10,790
Are you listening?

45
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:13,620
Will you be there
at the airport?

46
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:14,790
Hello...

47
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:08,540
- Are Santha and Gopan on leave?
- No, sir. They are here.

48
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,410
Didn't expect you today.

49
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,410
Who didn't expect?

50
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,080
Yes, who?

51
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:17,950
Tell to clean it up. Quick.

52
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,250
- Sir.
- Yeah.

53
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:20,750
Is the CJM here?

54
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:22,750
Yes, sir. He is in his chamber.

55
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:23,790
Okay.

56
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:54,120
Boxers and football players use this.

57
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:57,330
To fix the broken nose bridge.

58
00:09:57,450 --> 00:09:59,500
Well, they have a strong reason to do so.

59
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:02,160
Now, tell me...

60
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:04,160
What if something has happened
to the guy on the bike?

61
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,330
Can you imagine?

62
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:08,200
That too, just for sideswiping your car?

63
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:10,200
He called me names.

64
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,040
So? Will you chase and
knock him off, right?

65
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:16,250
You're not just a union leader
in the law college anymore.

66
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:17,580
But a judicial officer.

67
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,750
Don't forget that.

68
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:22,450
Sir, time for the meeting.

69
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,410
Okay.

70
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:30,080
Law Secretary is in the guest-house.

71
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:32,120
Come, let's call on him.

72
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:34,660
If he is angry for some reason...

73
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,830
It will vanish if he sees this face.

74
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:38,120
Spare me, sir.

75
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,000
Hey...

76
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:40,540
Come with me.

77
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,700
Yes, at 8 O'clock...

78
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,370
I'll be there.

79
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:49,250
Okay.

80
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:57,450
You know, how hard it was to
convince that boy's parents?

81
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:00,910
On top of that, none of the cops
like you one bit.

82
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:03,080
All are waiting for an opportunity.

83
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:06,500
Fortunately, the traffic DCP is new here.

84
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,500
It's by using a threat that a case for
attacking a judge could spoil his future...

85
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:12,330
...we could settle the issue.

86
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:17,870
Baby, why commit such blunders
when you're awaiting a promotion?

87
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:21,910
That's why, even though
you don't like it...

88
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:24,700
I'm dragging you to meet
the Law Secretary.

89
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,370
I'm not coming today.

90
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:31,290
I don't want another problem
because I said something to him.

91
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:32,790
Sir, you go and meet him.

92
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:34,450
I'll get off here.

93
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:39,500
Shiva...

94
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,830
Stop at the shopping mall.

95
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:43,500
Pull over.

96
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:48,540
I don't carry an umbrella...

97
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:50,040
...and this rain.

98
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:02,750
Where is it raining, man?

99
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,830
- Baby...
- Hmm...

100
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:20,000
What happened?

101
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:30,540
Take us to the general hospital.

102
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:35,080
Go meet Dr. Basheer.

103
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:53,160
'Out Patient
Block'

104
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,160
Listen, Baby...

105
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:00,160
Call me after you meet the doctor.

106
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:02,750
Take a fitness certificate too from him.

107
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:05,910
When you join, let things
be in order on our part.

108
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,450
To tell you the truth...

109
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:27,330
I too have felt that these guys
should be run over.

110
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:29,790
I have lost some hair.

111
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,500
But I'm still fit.

112
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:38,700
You don't have any problem, Mr.Magistrate.

113
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:40,700
The rain will stop on its own.

114
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:44,080
We all go through this stage.

115
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:46,410
Most people try to hide it.

116
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,250
Or to forget it.

117
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,790
But if you really like...

118
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:53,910
I can call it by a convoluted name.

119
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,950
Post-traumatic stress disorder.

120
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,620
The shock after an accident. That's all.

121
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:29,290
Though Dr. Basheer put it lightly
to make me stress free...

122
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:31,290
I don't feel good about it.

123
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:34,000
That's why I want a second opinion.

124
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:37,000
If it's Shalini, she will tell
the truth on my face.

125
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,000
True.

126
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,330
In case of speaking out...

127
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,000
My wife is a pro.

128
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:48,040
Given the unbearable heat now...

129
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:50,700
I'll gladly switch positions with you, dude.

130
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:51,870
Dude Rajappan...

131
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:54,250
Only thundershowers, I don't feel cold.

132
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:56,950
Really? Then I don't want it.

133
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:13,000
What's it, man?

134
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:21,200
Travel agency has confirmed
a car and a driver.

135
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,410
He will be here tomorrow.

136
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:26,250
- Which is the car?
- Pardon me...

137
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:27,410
Which car?

138
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:29,910
If you offer to pay for fuel
at government rates...

139
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:31,910
You think you will get a Jaguar?

140
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:38,370
Got ice-cold beer in the fridge.

141
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:40,000
Can we have one?

142
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:42,660
- Hey Magistrate...
- Yeah?

143
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:44,160
Can I bring one for you?

144
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:47,330
Bore.

145
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:01,410
Hatchu...

146
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:03,410
What's up, dear?

147
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:05,790
Okay, come.

148
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:17,950
What's up? Are you chill?

149
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,370
- You want it?
- No.

150
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:28,370
Get me a tea. Strong one.

151
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:31,700
Dude...

152
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:33,910
Can you drink tea?

153
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:35,750
Yeah

154
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:40,950
This is sour, man.

155
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:44,450
What did Dr. Basheer tell you?

156
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:05,080
I was telling Baby...

157
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:06,540
Nothing to worry.

158
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:07,750
So far...

159
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:08,750
Oh.

160
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:10,410
If this persists...

161
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:12,910
We can think about other
interventions.

162
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:18,450
No need to start the Dr.Basheer's
medication for now, right?

163
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:20,500
Let us see.

164
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:26,040
Dr.Basheer is a psychiatrist
and I'm a psychologist treating children.

165
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:27,700
You can feel that difference.

166
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:28,830
Don't forget that.

167
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,370
He too is a 'Baby'.

168
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:31,540
Baby dear.

169
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:32,700
Right?

170
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,540
Talking of children...

171
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,870
Got an interesting case yesterday.

172
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:41,410
A boy in second grade.

173
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:43,290
Must be 7 or 8 years old.

174
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:46,450
Teacher told the kids to tell a story
during the leisure hour.

175
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:49,620
When the other kids narrated
the usual cat and crow stories...

176
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:52,290
Our man stood up and told
a great murder story.

177
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:54,830
Teacher and kids were horrified.

178
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:57,160
They called me there.

179
00:18:58,660 --> 00:18:59,830
What was the story?

180
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:03,540
He must have come up with it
from the TV shows or films he watched.

181
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:06,040
He doesn't feel guilty about it at all.

182
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:09,750
He was like...why did the teacher
and principal scold him for nothing?

183
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:11,750
I patted him for that.

184
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:14,250
Why discourage a budding
storyteller?

185
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:16,080
Kids of this generation...

186
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:18,290
You know how harmless I was...

187
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:21,790
Harmless, my foot.

188
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,540
The car from the travel agency.

189
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:38,200
I started early to arrive in time.

190
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:40,200
Installed the official name board too.

191
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,410
Did I scare you?

192
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:46,580
Got fooled. Burned all that I ate
in the morning.

193
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,410
- I forgot to ask your name.
- Kaif.

194
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:51,290
From Payyoli.

195
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:54,120
- Near Vadakara...
- Got it.

196
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:12,200
Switch on the wipers, man.

197
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:13,750
What? Wiper?

198
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:23,950
This is good.

199
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:27,620
Like headlights during daytime,
this too should become a rule.

200
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:49,910
Case # 12/1433

201
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:52,870
Date : 16-02-2019

202
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:56,250
Ashlee, Ismon, Vishnu, Shamal, Saijos

203
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:57,250
Sir...

204
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:00,450
College youth festival
will start next week.

205
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:03,830
It would be of great help
if you post it to next week.

206
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:10,660
During a students' protest...

207
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:14,540
Driver of a parked bus
was dragged out and beaten up.

208
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:20,870
Where do you work?

209
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:22,910
In the Payyannur bus depot.

210
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,250
Did you come all the way
from there for this hearing?

211
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:26,410
Yes, sir.

212
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:34,580
Two-way AC chair car
ticket for his travel...

213
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:36,950
Food, stay and other expenses...

214
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:40,330
Will your clients bear
the cost of all these?

215
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,500
If not, you may start your arguments
without wasting time.

216
00:21:58,410 --> 00:21:59,580
Come in.

217
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:05,290
Any problem?

218
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:06,450
Take a seat.

219
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:11,120
I'm thinking of taking a few more
days of leave.

220
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:12,290
Is it the other issue?

221
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:14,620
No, that's almost gone now

222
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:18,160
I feel weird with
this thing on my face.

223
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,700
I can remove it after a week.
Till then...

224
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:27,000
In the two weeks that you were in hospital,
we were postponing and reassigning cases.

225
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:31,250
It would be good if we clear some backlog
before the court closes for summer break.

226
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:33,200
You know the situation here.

227
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:35,950
I'll get back to you tomorrow, sir.

228
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:40,450
If you decide to go on leave,
inform the district judge.

229
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:45,660
Baby, want to eat lunch?

230
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:27,370
Yes

231
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,540
Are you busy?

232
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,870
No, tell me.

233
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:34,080
Remember the school kid
I told you about yesterday?

234
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:35,370
It's about him.

235
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:38,410
Can I meet you in person?

236
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:40,410
Hmm.

237
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:00,700
His name is Nitin.

238
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:03,370
Today, another teacher
saw this accidentally.

239
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:07,540
In his rough book, he has written
the story that I told you about.

240
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:12,410
I read it.
It's in Malayalam.

241
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,540
The style is that of a child.

242
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:16,910
It has typos, grammar errors and all that.

243
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:20,950
But the thing is, he was born
and brought up in Bangalore.

244
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:23,950
When his mom was transferred to
Info-park recently...

245
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:26,620
She enrolled him here
in the mid-term.

246
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:27,830
His father?

247
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
He is no more.
Died in an accident.

248
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,620
He has only his mother.

249
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:34,370
She is into motion graphics
or something like that.

250
00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:36,540
She is pretty famous in that field.

251
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:39,370
I called her. She is very angry.

252
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:42,750
Said we are taking the kid's
little pranks way too far.

253
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:52,910
The story is, killing a man and
drowning in a pond by tying him to a rock.

254
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,120
He is...

255
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,620
He seems to be a genius.

256
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:05,120
It's not that, Baby.

257
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:08,200
In the story, he clearly
refers to a place.

258
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:10,870
Which place?

259
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:14,040
Karuvatta.

260
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:17,080
It's in Alappuzha.

261
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,910
A remote village.

262
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,080
Didn't I tell you?

263
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,790
Nitin is not even familiar with
the places in this city.

264
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:23,950
Then how?

265
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:26,950
There's another thing.

266
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30,790
A sentence in the story
glaringly stands out.

267
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,700
That... It looks as if someone else
has written it.

268
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:47,410
My initial diagnosis after meeting
Nitin for the first time was wrong.

269
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:49,410
He has some problem.

270
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:52,250
Like me?

271
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:59,290
Can I meet him?

272
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:00,790
Why?

273
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:02,290
Just like that.

274
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:04,000
You know the law. Don't you?

275
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:06,160
It should be in the presence of the parent.

276
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,830
I told you, his mother is
over protective.

277
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:11,330
I'm not sure if she'll agree.

278
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,830
Try speaking with her.

279
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:31,120
The weight of all that
was read is enough...

280
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:33,620
To prevent from coming up floating.

281
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:42,450
She wants to meet you first
and then decide.

282
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:24,040
Sharmila, meet John Baby.
He is the judicial magistrate here.

283
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:34,580
I can understand why the school
engaged a psychologist for counseling.

284
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:37,620
But why court, judge and all that?

285
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:41,450
Please, this isn't official or anything.

286
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:43,620
Shalini and I are good friends.

287
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:46,660
We discuss cases whenever we meet.

288
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,830
When I heard about Nitin,
I wanted to meet him.

289
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,660
Hmm. A case?

290
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:53,660
After meeting, what?

291
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:57,870
No real purpose.
I want just a casual chat.

292
00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:02,250
Mr.Baby, Nitin is an intelligent
and creative kid.

293
00:28:02,410 --> 00:28:04,080
He has got good imagination.

294
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,250
I've never tried to curtail it.

295
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:09,910
After that incident,
he is too uncomfortable.

296
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:11,750
As if he has committed some crime.

297
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:13,750
You can't do this to my child.

298
00:28:15,290 --> 00:28:19,660
Sharmila, don't you feel strange about
the clear reference to the place?

299
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:26,330
Doctor, even grown-ups create stories
connecting things that they learn and hear.

300
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:29,540
Right? I know what it is.

301
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:32,700
He is a kid with a single parent.
That too, only the mother.

302
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:36,250
Even if times change, your science
and law will remain the same.

303
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:38,700
Even I had only my mother.

304
00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:42,580
So, I know that stigma very well.

305
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:45,290
Sharmila, let's stop.
Sorry for the trouble.

306
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:47,450
Let me tell you...

307
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:50,450
As far as I know,
this is serious enough...

308
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:53,330
...for the doctor or teacher
to report it to the authorities.

309
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,660
You mean, the police?

310
00:28:59,000 --> 00:28:59,830
Yes.

311
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:20,450
Ninth floor. I'll come by the stairs.

312
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:23,620
Healthy...

313
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:38,870
- What?
- Nothing.

314
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:28,250
This is Megha.
She takes care of Nitin.

315
00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:29,120
Part time.

316
00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:30,620
One minute...

317
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,000
- Is Niti back?
- Yeah.

318
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,660
- Did he eat anything?
- Lightly.

319
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:40,330
Leave then. Study well.
You have exams.

320
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,160
Want to serve them tea?

321
00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:48,200
- I'll manage it.
- OK.

322
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:51,250
What's on his face?

323
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:01,910
Niti...

324
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:05,290
I'm leaving. See you tomorrow.

325
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:13,660
Meghu...

326
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:21,700
Don't leave...

327
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:23,410
Meghu...

328
00:31:24,410 --> 00:31:25,410
Here...

329
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:27,250
You keep it.
Return it later.

330
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:29,580
- It's over.
- Really? OK.

331
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:44,830
Hi Nitin.

332
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:46,330
Hi doctor.

333
00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:50,200
He is my friend. Baby.

334
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,200
Hello.

335
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:55,580
Are you a doctor?

336
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:57,540
Hey, not at all.

337
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:02,080
You both drink coffee, right?

338
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,250
Yeah.

339
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:05,290
You want something?

340
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:14,330
Got another one like that?

341
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:16,660
Why not?

342
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,000
I'll get it.

343
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:21,370
Can I get a different colour?

344
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:24,200
I'll try for sure.

345
00:32:26,370 --> 00:32:27,370
Cool!

346
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:32,080
Got some super power?

347
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:33,250
Of course.

348
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:34,410
Really?

349
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:35,250
You bet.

350
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:37,910
Super power goes up at night.

351
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:39,290
Really super.

352
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:41,580
No, you're kidding me.

353
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:43,290
Hold my hand. See?

354
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:44,330
Goes up in a second.

355
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:45,290
Niti...

356
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:47,330
I've kept chocolate fudge there.

357
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,330
Okay...

358
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,700
Yeah. Thank you.

359
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,200
Thank you.

360
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:01,910
What's the judgement?

361
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:07,080
Didn't the teacher give you
the page of that story?

362
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:34,370
I will take a look and
give it to Shalini.

363
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:37,080
Thanks.

364
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:41,410
- See you.
- Bye.

365
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:42,580
Bye.

366
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:44,950
- Bye, Nitin.
- Bye, doctor.

367
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:08,200
What do you feel
after meeting him?

368
00:34:08,910 --> 00:34:11,410
Will there be kids
normal than him?

369
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:15,410
You won't find magistrates
normal than me, either.

370
00:34:18,450 --> 00:34:22,290
As you said, his mother is
a bit over protective.

371
00:34:23,290 --> 00:34:25,120
She knows something is wrong.

372
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:29,620
But since it's her own kid,
she'll take time to convince herself.

373
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:32,330
- Niti..
- Yeah...

374
00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:35,540
Take some more if you want.

375
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:41,200
Go and brush your teeth then.
Give to me.

376
00:34:43,410 --> 00:34:44,870
- Niti...
- Yeah.

377
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,580
How about an outing today?

378
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:47,540
Sure.

379
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,580
How is doctor's friend?

380
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:28,950
He rocks.
Got that Nightwing look.

381
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:31,660
Who is Nightwing?
Batman's friend?

382
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:33,290
Yeah.

383
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,330
But Nightwing is younger, right?

384
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,830
Batman is much elder to me, right?

385
00:35:41,370 --> 00:35:42,200
Oh...

386
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:43,700
Now I get it.

387
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,830
So, you're Batman!

388
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,200
Mm-hmm.

389
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:08,500
Green pond...

390
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Green toad...

391
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:18,700
When shattered medicine bottles
tore in and killed them...

392
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:23,040
Cries of toads and the sound
of Karuvatta church bell.

393
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:28,250
When a stone was tied to the
the chest and dipped in water...

394
00:36:28,410 --> 00:36:30,410
Drowned with the eyes wide open.

395
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:33,450
The weight of all that
was read is enough...

396
00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:35,290
To prevent from floating up.

397
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:44,000
- Good morning, sir.
- Mm.

398
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:50,000
There is a place, Karuvatta.
In Alappuzha.

399
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,500
Am I being transferred, sir?

400
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,040
Find out the police station there...

401
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,540
Tell the SHO to call me.

402
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:58,000
- It's urgent.
- Sure.

404
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:04,080
- Sir, the fake witness was tutored...
- My lord...

405
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,910
- He is levelling false accusations.
- My lord...

406
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:09,750
- When I tell the truth...
- Truth, it seems!

407
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:11,620
Enough. I can't let this go on.

408
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:17,450
Sir, my client A, bill number 529/01-6-2009...

409
00:38:17,450 --> 00:38:19,290
I have furnished the...

410
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:22,830
In Harippad station and
in the locality I told you about...

411
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:26,660
All the recently registered cases
and man missing reports.

412
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:29,370
Okay. Thank you.

413
00:38:31,870 --> 00:38:33,750
- Kaif, we'll go to Alappuzha tomorrow.
- Sure, sir.

414
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:35,370
Long trips are profitable anyway.

415
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:36,910
Mm-hmm.

416
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:11,750
Sir!

417
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:16,620
Satheesan sir left this morning
to Kochi for a case.

418
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:17,790
That's fine.

419
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:20,950
- I had asked for a details...
- I've arranged some, sir.

420
00:39:24,450 --> 00:39:25,290
Sir!

421
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:27,500
He is our senior CPO,
Sainuddin.

422
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:29,000
Take a seat, Sainuddin.

423
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:40,540
Sir, we've collected details of cases
in the three stations in this area.

424
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,540
In our jurisdiction
during the last three months....

425
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:45,200
There were two murders.

426
00:39:45,410 --> 00:39:46,870
Both were related to family feud.

427
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:49,250
The next one was a
highway accident.

428
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:51,290
That was section 304-A.

429
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:53,950
What about those two murders?

430
00:39:54,910 --> 00:39:57,790
One was stabbing and
the other was poisoning.

431
00:40:06,330 --> 00:40:08,540
Any deaths by drowning?

432
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:10,200
Yes, sir. There is one.

433
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,540
In Kariyilakulangara station.

434
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,750
Somasekharan, aged 47 years.

435
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,910
He fell into the well
at home and died.

436
00:40:22,410 --> 00:40:24,290
He went in to fetch
the lost bucket.

437
00:40:24,910 --> 00:40:26,620
Then? Did he get the bucket?

438
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:29,750
For that, we have to check
the mahassar, sir.

439
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,500
Sir, please drink tea.

440
00:40:40,330 --> 00:40:43,370
Sir, if you can tell me
what exactly are you investigating...

441
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,700
In the statements related to
a robbery case under trial...

442
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:50,910
There are pointers to some
incidents that happened around here.

443
00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:54,410
But in the case diary, I saw that
those leads aren't probed so far.

444
00:40:56,750 --> 00:40:58,950
It's just my curiosity.
That's all.

445
00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:02,120
Are there ponds around here?

446
00:41:03,290 --> 00:41:04,620
This is Alappuzha, sir.

447
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:06,330
Plenty of ponds and canals.

448
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:07,830
No, what I meant was...

449
00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:11,660
Unused ones covered by
algae and all, you know.

450
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:15,370
Pond covered with algae..?

451
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:18,540
Sainu sir, what about the
ruined pond in Karamoodu?

452
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:20,700
Yes, Vijayan.
Come in.

453
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:28,750
Vijayan is a local.

454
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:30,580
From the eastern side.
Thanappadi.

455
00:41:30,950 --> 00:41:32,620
Where exactly is this pond?

456
00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:35,290
About half a mile from here.

457
00:41:36,290 --> 00:41:39,330
You know the pond behind
the old health centre, right?

458
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:41,620
Okay, got it.

459
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,160
Dispensary?
What was it like?

460
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,500
There used to be a
full-time compounder there.

461
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:49,370
When the Taluk Hospital
was started...

462
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:51,040
Dispensary was closed down.

463
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:53,500
Then anti-social elements
occupied it.

464
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:55,700
Booze, gambling...
Pretty much everything.

465
00:41:55,750 --> 00:41:58,910
CI Sharaf sir rounded them up
and evacuated the place.

466
00:41:59,410 --> 00:42:03,250
After acquiring land for the road,
the local body demolished the building.

467
00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:05,450
When was it?

468
00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:09,450
Almost 7-8 years back.

469
00:42:18,330 --> 00:42:19,700
Let's go there.

470
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:26,160
Why not?

471
00:42:27,370 --> 00:42:30,250
- Vijayan, get the vehicle ready.
- Sure, sir.

472
00:42:33,910 --> 00:42:35,910
Is Karuvatta church that side?

473
00:42:35,910 --> 00:42:37,450
Church is towards the west, sir.

474
00:42:38,290 --> 00:42:39,290
I mean...

475
00:42:39,450 --> 00:42:41,910
Is it close enough to hear
the church bell?

476
00:42:42,790 --> 00:42:45,290
That depends on the strength
of the one who rings it.

477
00:43:08,950 --> 00:43:10,950
Vijayan, is this the route?

478
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:55,500
The dispensary was that side, sir.

479
00:43:57,330 --> 00:43:59,370
Students, take out your books.

480
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:09,200
It's summer. Haven't I told you
to drink plenty of water?

481
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:11,750
Lekha, get some water. Quick!

482
00:44:13,750 --> 00:44:15,080
- Mr. Vijayan.
- Sir.

483
00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:17,580
Can you get someone
who can dive in this?

484
00:44:18,790 --> 00:44:20,790
I can pay what they ask for.

485
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:22,790
Sure, sir. Let me try.

486
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:30,160
What is in here, sir?

487
00:44:33,370 --> 00:44:35,200
Let's hope there is nothing.

488
00:44:57,120 --> 00:45:00,000
It's dehydration.
We've given him IV.

489
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:02,830
He is okay now.
Right, Nitin?

490
00:45:03,330 --> 00:45:06,330
During the interval, he will run
in the hot sun around the ground.

491
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:08,540
But won't drink a drop of water.

492
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:10,370
He can avoid going to
the toilet, right?

493
00:45:10,370 --> 00:45:12,540

No.

banned and fake currencies...

...was packed in plastic bags and
thrown into a pond somewhere here.

00:51:40,830 --> 00:51:42,000
Just a courtesy call?

540
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,700
I had gone to Harippad yesterday.

541
00:51:45,830 --> 00:51:47,500
Wanted to tell you about that.

542
00:51:48,370 --> 00:51:50,200
Everyone knows about it now.

543
00:51:50,870 --> 00:51:52,370
District Judge informed me.

544
00:51:52,370 --> 00:51:54,370
He was informed by Home Secretary.

545
00:51:55,540 --> 00:52:00,580
It seems DGP asked why we need state police
if judges can directly investigate cases!

546
00:52:04,290 --> 00:52:09,120
Haven't I told you about my plan to
register for a PhD in Law University?

547
00:52:09,950 --> 00:52:15,160
For the proposal, I refer files in the
library and archives in my free time.

548
00:52:15,330 --> 00:52:17,830
When I read some old case diaries
belonging to that place...

549
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,660
I was curious to do some
interesting field work.

550
00:52:20,870 --> 00:52:22,500
The officers messed it up.

551
00:52:22,540 --> 00:52:25,870
I heard that you went there to
probe some fake currency case.

552
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:29,250
That was a spontaneous excuse
that I came up with.

553
00:52:29,410 --> 00:52:32,200
Baby, are you hiding something
from me?

554
00:52:32,870 --> 00:52:34,910
No. I swear.

555
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:41,950
Send me the details of those references.

556
00:52:42,790 --> 00:52:44,790
Sure, let me check and share those.

557
00:52:44,950 --> 00:52:46,660
Those are 7-8 years old.

558
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:50,500
Man, forensic guys say the
skeleton is at least 30 years old.

559
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:56,830
To confirm, they are sending it to
the anthropology lab in Delhi.

560
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:00,540
30 years back?

561
00:53:00,540 --> 00:53:02,870
This is getting even more complicated.

562
00:53:03,410 --> 00:53:07,250
On top of that, my boss and
the police chief are questioning me.

563
00:53:07,910 --> 00:53:09,750
I had spoken to Sharmila.

564
00:53:10,580 --> 00:53:13,120
For now, don't tell them
about these developments.

565
00:53:13,290 --> 00:53:14,290
No, I won't.

566
00:53:14,450 --> 00:53:16,290
She wants to meet you.

567
00:53:16,290 --> 00:53:17,450
You can tell her.

568
00:53:17,830 --> 00:53:19,500
Okay, I'll call her.

569
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:58,000
I've to discuss a few things with you.

570
00:54:00,330 --> 00:54:04,830
Mr.Baby, can we meet tomorrow?

571
00:54:15,290 --> 00:54:20,620
No, Niti has never spoken about
or written anything like this.

572
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:24,790
I secretly checked all the books
in his room.

573
00:54:25,290 --> 00:54:30,000
Poor kid. I was the one who insisted
that he learn to write and speak Malayalam.

574
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,330
It turned out to be like this.

575
00:54:32,330 --> 00:54:34,040
Is there someone who
Nitin is close to?

576
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:35,700
Either in Bangalore or here?

577
00:54:38,870 --> 00:54:43,580
We have no one who can
narrate

578
00:54:45,410 --> 00:54:49,250
I'm a mother who can't even
sing a lullaby properly.

579
00:54:53,580 --> 00:54:55,910
Anyway, don't reveal anything
to him for now.

580
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:57,790
Nitin is not in the
picture now.

581
00:54:57,830 --> 00:54:59,500
Let it stay that way
for now.

582
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Yes, Shalini told me. Thanks.

583
00:55:03,790 --> 00:55:05,160
After I left my lawyer's job,

584
00:55:05,330 --> 00:55:08,330
I am telling such blatant lies
only since last couple of days.

585
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:17,410
Through sessions with Nitin,
Shalini will find out what this is.

586
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:19,250
She is very good with children.

587
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:21,910
Mr.Baby...

588
00:55:22,410 --> 00:55:24,750
John too is like that, I think.

589
00:55:25,450 --> 00:55:27,750
You made friends with
Niti pretty fast.

590
00:55:29,580 --> 00:55:31,120
He calls you Bebo.

591
00:55:31,450 --> 00:55:32,450
Yeah?

592
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:35,450
The name Kareena Kapoor's
best friend Karan Johar calls her.

593
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:38,160
This boy!

594
00:57:01,750 --> 00:57:02,790
Stop it, you!

595
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:06,790
That's all I can do, sir.

596
00:57:18,830 --> 00:57:19,830
What?

597
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:22,370
Now the sky is clear of rainclouds.

598
00:57:22,870 --> 00:57:24,870
Just a pleasant sun shower.

599
00:57:25,540 --> 00:57:27,040
Like the proverbial fox's wedding.

600
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:28,870
Yeah, you were always a fox.

601
00:57:28,910 --> 00:57:31,700
Then the wedding. Get on with it!

602
00:57:31,750 --> 00:57:35,250
What's wrong with you?
It's just my love for the boy.

603
00:58:29,700 --> 00:58:32,370
I'm going home tomorrow.
Mom has returned.

604
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:35,200
I have to argue my case of why
I couldn't go to the airport to pick her.

605
00:58:35,250 --> 00:58:37,580
I've had it if I don't call on her.

606
00:58:37,750 --> 00:58:39,410
Bebo, can I come with you?

607
00:58:39,750 --> 00:58:41,750
Dear, no...

608
00:58:43,250 --> 00:58:46,620
Why not? Tomorrow is a holiday.
We can return by evening.

609
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:49,950
Sure.

610
00:58:50,620 --> 00:58:51,500
Yes!

611
00:59:55,950 --> 00:59:58,620
Don't give him too much at a time.

612
00:59:58,620 --> 01:00:01,330
As a kid, Baby too loved candies.

613
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:03,450
With his teeth full of cavities.

614
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:08,160
Then...

615
01:00:08,830 --> 01:00:11,660
Are you both in love or something?

616
01:00:12,540 --> 01:00:14,040
No, not at all.

617
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:15,750
My son and John are good friends.

618
01:00:15,870 --> 01:00:16,910
That's all.

619
01:00:19,080 --> 01:00:21,750
I am very open and direct
in my talk.

620
01:00:21,750 --> 01:00:24,080
Hope you don't mind, dear.

621
01:00:24,790 --> 01:00:28,620
I used to have small talk
with the neighbours in America...

622
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:31,620
My daughter and granddaughter
always warn me not to.

623
01:00:32,660 --> 01:00:36,330
While in law college, Baby had
an intense love affair.

624
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:38,330
She used to come here and all.

625
01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:41,200
Those days, his dad was alive.

626
01:00:41,330 --> 01:00:42,870
A sweet girl.

627
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:45,200
We all loved her.

628
01:00:45,700 --> 01:00:48,870
I don't know why. They fell out
with each other and broke up.

629
01:00:48,870 --> 01:00:50,870
Since then, he has been single.

630
01:00:55,410 --> 01:00:56,450
Here, take this.

631
01:01:13,830 --> 01:01:15,870
- Bebo...
- What's it, man?

632
01:01:16,540 --> 01:01:18,700
Are your thundershowers
receding?

633
01:01:22,410 --> 01:01:23,410
Yeah, man.

634
01:01:31,580 --> 01:01:33,290
Shall I tell you something?

635
01:01:35,450 --> 01:01:36,620
Yeah, go on.

636
01:01:37,290 --> 01:01:39,120
I know more stories.

637
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:02,450
Intermission

638
01:02:25,370 --> 01:02:27,370
So you don't know
anything else?

639
01:02:29,750 --> 01:02:33,580
Records from British era
have noted this aspect.

640
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:36,250
'Water bodies and crimes'

641
01:02:36,290 --> 01:02:42,120
The relations between water bodies
and crimes. That's my research topic.

642
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:46,830
But getting this skeleton
was a big coincidence.

643
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,830
- Strange!
- Yeah, very strange.

644
01:02:54,870 --> 01:02:57,540
Report from the lab in Delhi.

645
01:02:59,370 --> 01:03:02,040
The skeleton is of one Mohan.

646
01:03:04,410 --> 01:03:08,370
From that locality.
Had gone missing 28 years ago.

647
01:03:08,410 --> 01:03:12,450
He was a coconut palm climber.
Along with it some social work too.

648
01:03:12,580 --> 01:03:14,450
Some local activism and all.

649
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:36,250
Sir, you can't park here.

650
01:03:36,910 --> 01:03:38,580
- Sorry.
- Sir.

651
01:03:59,500 --> 01:04:04,700
I'm clueless about
where to start or how to proceed.

652
01:04:06,370 --> 01:04:11,200
I also don't know what to do. Yesterday
Shalini had talked with him for a long time.

653
01:04:11,250 --> 01:04:14,080
He didn't mention to her the new story.

654
01:04:15,080 --> 01:04:19,450
Shalini says he mentioned it to you
because he trusts you deeply.

655
01:04:31,790 --> 01:04:35,870
Anyway, I'm not asking him
anything about this story.

656
01:04:39,160 --> 01:04:43,040
I have been getting
offers from Europe.

657
01:04:43,700 --> 01:04:46,410
Sweden. Nice place.

658
01:04:46,580 --> 01:04:50,080
A change might help Nitin too.

659
01:05:04,660 --> 01:05:06,830
Rs. 1200?!
How will I pay it?

660
01:05:06,830 --> 01:05:10,370
Since the person is identified,
some new information may come up.

661
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:12,200
Then we can...

662
01:05:12,500 --> 01:05:15,250
Leave me.
I'll give the money.

663
01:05:16,410 --> 01:05:18,870
We'll see the further proceeding then.

664
01:05:59,950 --> 01:06:01,450
- Hey!
- Yes...

665
01:06:07,330 --> 01:06:10,450
Sir, it's my wife. If I don't pick up,
she'll be suspicious.

666
01:06:37,290 --> 01:06:39,660
A lady has been
waiting since morning.

667
01:06:40,290 --> 01:06:44,160
Is it about some case? Didn't you
say I can't meet like that?

668
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:46,540
Yes. She said it's
something personal.

669
01:06:46,660 --> 01:06:49,660
She is from Karuvatta,
she wanted me to inform you.

670
01:07:14,620 --> 01:07:17,660
I'm Bhanu.
I'm from Karuvatta.

671
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,540
Mohan was cremated
yesterday evening.

672
01:07:23,870 --> 01:07:26,160
We were engaged.

673
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:32,410
I waited 7-8 years
after he disappeared.

674
01:07:32,580 --> 01:07:36,580
Then married someone else.
Have 2 kids.

675
01:07:42,450 --> 01:07:44,830
Mohan had enemies?

676
01:07:45,500 --> 01:07:48,620
He was bold enough to oppose any injustice.

677
01:07:48,660 --> 01:07:50,660
Very proud and adamant.

678
01:07:51,450 --> 01:07:55,160
Someone once scorned him
in a gathering for his caste.

679
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:57,500
For that he turned down
his government teacher job...

680
01:07:57,540 --> 01:07:59,370
...and became a coconut palm climber.

681
01:08:03,040 --> 01:08:06,410
The day he went missing,
there was big chaos at our place.

682
01:08:06,910 --> 01:08:11,450
The dike broke at Thottappally estuary
and water had entered all the fields.

683
01:08:11,950 --> 01:08:15,580
Nobody knew where
or with whom he went.

684
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:21,660
He didn't go anywhere, he was
right there. No one realised it.

685
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:32,700
Sir, please tell me the truth.

686
01:08:34,540 --> 01:08:40,080
Wasn't it Mohan who informed you
that he was sleeping under that lake?

687
01:08:47,950 --> 01:08:49,790
Only I need to know.

688
01:08:55,330 --> 01:08:59,160
Great! All we were lacking
were some ghosts...

689
01:09:02,370 --> 01:09:05,540
What else! He is up to
scaring me with these stories...

690
01:09:07,410 --> 01:09:11,750
In a way, isn't she right?
Who would have told this to Nitin?

691
01:09:12,250 --> 01:09:14,080
Either the murderer.

692
01:09:14,750 --> 01:09:16,410
Or the one murdered.

693
01:09:16,750 --> 01:09:20,950
Enough with your theory.
You've been mad for a while...

694
01:09:22,790 --> 01:09:24,000
Where to?

695
01:09:24,290 --> 01:09:26,830
Let me have a drink.
Can't take this otherwise.

696
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:31,000
It's sure someone
told it to Nitin.

697
01:09:31,830 --> 01:09:34,160
Wonder why he is not admitting it.

698
01:09:34,370 --> 01:09:38,200
Is he scared?
Or is it something else...

699
01:09:40,540 --> 01:09:42,910
What about making him
narrate the new story?

700
01:09:45,250 --> 01:09:48,580
I can't. I can't even handle
the existing pressures.

701
01:09:48,790 --> 01:09:50,410
I was just saying...

702
01:09:53,450 --> 01:09:56,910
Mr. Magistrate, I need a drink before
I give you a piece of my mind.

703
01:09:59,160 --> 01:10:00,620
OK, I'll make a move.

704
01:10:01,330 --> 01:10:04,000
- Wait. Eat something.
- No.

705
01:10:07,700 --> 01:10:11,830
Come come.
Meghu, come.

706
01:10:16,750 --> 01:10:18,580
No need to hold hands, Meghu.

707
01:10:18,910 --> 01:10:20,580
Let me call my mom

708
01:10:20,700 --> 01:10:22,580
Go...slowly

709
01:10:23,410 --> 01:10:25,120
Don't wet your dress, Nitin.

710
01:10:39,330 --> 01:10:42,040
- Come on.
- No dear, you go.

711
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:47,000
- Bebo, come.
- Oh no. Go on.

712
01:10:49,700 --> 01:10:53,200
- Meghu, come. Let's play.
- Meghna, take care.

713
01:10:53,410 --> 01:10:55,750
- Meghu, come
- Hold my hand.

714
01:10:56,580 --> 01:10:59,290
Careful, Nitin.

715
01:11:09,830 --> 01:11:13,330
Sir, can I serve you
piping hot Banana fritters?

716
01:11:13,500 --> 01:11:15,540
Leave me alone, my dear!

717
01:11:21,370 --> 01:11:23,250
Come Meghu, run...

718
01:11:33,450 --> 01:11:36,120
I haven't told you
anything about Nitin's dad.

719
01:11:37,830 --> 01:11:41,290
Sachin was a special correspondent
with 'The Stateman'.

720
01:11:41,330 --> 01:11:43,120
We met in Delhi.

721
01:11:43,620 --> 01:11:49,370
Then we moved to Bangalore.
The marriage was registered there.

722
01:11:50,200 --> 01:11:51,870
Your families?

723
01:11:54,040 --> 01:11:55,870
It was just friends
and colleagues.

724
01:11:55,910 --> 01:11:58,910
Sachin's family was strongly
against it. Caste difference.

725
01:12:02,080 --> 01:12:05,790
I've told about me, right?
My parents died very early.

726
01:12:09,910 --> 01:12:14,290
Sachin was obsessed with
investigative stories. One after the other.

727
01:12:18,830 --> 01:12:22,870
One night he went to
meet a secret source.

728
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:25,370
In an unfinished building in the suburb.

729
01:12:29,580 --> 01:12:32,200
Accident? Or...

730
01:12:33,580 --> 01:12:34,750
Don't know.

731
01:12:36,910 --> 01:12:40,250
Nitin was born
the night Sachin passed away.

732
01:12:40,290 --> 01:12:41,790
Premature birth.

733
01:12:48,790 --> 01:12:56,040
Like that lady mentioned, what if Nitin
is getting these stories from his father?

734
01:13:06,410 --> 01:13:11,620
I've kept all of Sachin's computers
and files safe in Bangalore.

735
01:13:13,450 --> 01:13:15,950
Shall we go check?

736
01:13:35,700 --> 01:13:37,910
Meghu, come here!

737
01:13:43,910 --> 01:13:46,620
- Nitin!
- Coming.

738
01:13:51,290 --> 01:13:53,620
Bebo, come play.

739
01:13:57,330 --> 01:14:03,040
Let's hear your new story first.

740
01:14:04,040 --> 01:14:06,370
That one after this game.

741
01:14:08,870 --> 01:14:11,250
You know where
the story takes place?

742
01:14:16,250 --> 01:14:18,450
Is Cherai Thura
the name of a place?

743
01:14:47,580 --> 01:14:50,080
Nice!
Lovely family.

744
01:14:54,450 --> 01:14:57,290
It's an enormous swamp.

745
01:14:57,790 --> 01:15:00,000
In dark brown color.

746
01:15:00,500 --> 01:15:05,500
All the rotten fish of Cherai Thura
is dumped here.

747
01:15:06,160 --> 01:15:08,870
Thus it's full of fish.

748
01:15:09,870 --> 01:15:14,580
The fattie was also
dumped there, like the fish.

749
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:18,910
As he went down, bubs...

750
01:15:19,250 --> 01:15:22,750
- Bubbles?
- Ya, those will come up.

751
01:15:33,330 --> 01:15:36,000
What, he is speeding up again!

752
01:16:15,870 --> 01:16:16,870
Sir.

753
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:18,870
Sir, you can park
the car there.

754
01:16:25,250 --> 01:16:27,250
Why I insisted in meeting outside...

755
01:16:27,410 --> 01:16:31,950
There are two guys from special branch
in the station. Both are useless.

756
01:16:32,290 --> 01:16:33,790
They are from the association.

757
01:16:34,290 --> 01:16:37,000
Also, your profession is one
that's hated by police force.

758
01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:41,120
Because for the curses we say to people,
we get repaid in the courtroom.

759
01:16:43,830 --> 01:16:48,660
Good that you suggested meeting here.
We are saved of a special branch report.

760
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:55,200
- Aftab
- Yes?

761
01:16:55,700 --> 01:16:58,040
Are there any marshes nearby?

762
01:16:59,250 --> 01:17:02,250
Marshes and Mangroves,
you find here and there.

763
01:17:02,750 --> 01:17:05,290
I've found someone who can help you.

764
01:17:05,290 --> 01:17:07,620
An additional sub inspector
who retired when I joined.

765
01:17:07,750 --> 01:17:10,830
From around here.
He's a nice man. Name is Michael.

766
01:17:11,660 --> 01:17:13,660
I was just calling you, sir.

767
01:17:18,660 --> 01:17:20,330
What does the judge want?

768
01:17:20,540 --> 01:17:24,830
Michael, is there a marsh nearby?
A big one.

769
01:17:25,370 --> 01:17:28,870
Where fish waste from
the beach is dumped?

770
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:31,080
Ah got it. Meenmutti.

771
01:17:33,540 --> 01:17:35,620
If you are free,
can we go there?

772
01:17:36,450 --> 01:17:38,290
OK sir.

773
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:35,540
This is the Meenmutti marsh
you were asking for.

774
01:18:38,410 --> 01:18:41,580
How long has it been
since the marsh was filled?

775
01:18:41,870 --> 01:18:45,750
It will be... at least 25 years.

776
01:18:46,450 --> 01:18:50,660
It was the ancestral property of one Yohannan.
It had extended till the estuary.

777
01:18:50,950 --> 01:18:55,500
During the real estate boom in Kochi,
even the marsh became pricey.

778
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:59,540
There was lot of demand.
But, Yohannan didn't entertain any.

779
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,160
He was a peculiar kind.

780
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:07,540
Used to stand in for local body elections as
an independent candidate, distill his own arrack...

781
01:19:07,750 --> 01:19:13,910
A strange life... Intoxicated in
his own liquor, he died in this marsh.

782
01:19:14,870 --> 01:19:17,580
Then the land transaction
happened in a jiffy.

783
01:19:21,450 --> 01:19:26,160
Was this Yohannan a huge man?

784
01:19:26,500 --> 01:19:30,830
Of course. He could stand firm
even against a wild buffalo.

785
01:19:34,160 --> 01:19:36,370
How do you know all this?

786
01:19:38,040 --> 01:19:43,080
No, I was looking into
some old incidents as part of a research.

787
01:19:43,910 --> 01:19:47,250
Are you sure Yohannan's
death was by accident?

788
01:19:47,410 --> 01:19:51,790
I had just entered the service.
Was in reserve camp at Malappuram.

789
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:55,790
It's just what I heard over calls
and during visits to home.

790
01:19:55,910 --> 01:19:59,830
Our station must be having
old files. Right, Aftab sir?

791
01:21:02,080 --> 01:21:05,120
I searched around here.
This also isn't fiction.

792
01:21:06,160 --> 01:21:08,660
It's more than quarter century old.

793
01:21:11,330 --> 01:21:15,200
As you said, let's go to
Bangalore as soon as we can.

794
01:21:33,950 --> 01:21:35,910
Superintendent Sir, Look...

795
01:21:38,830 --> 01:21:40,160
Good... Sir.

796
01:21:40,330 --> 01:21:42,790
- You're not dead?
- No, sir.

797
01:21:42,830 --> 01:21:46,830
Under your watch, that magistrate went to
Cherai and caused all this trouble, right?

798
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:50,700
But sir, I didn't even reach Varappuzha bridge.
Before that this happened...

799
01:21:50,700 --> 01:21:51,830
Such idiots...

800
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:55,040
Dear sir, I can't bear
this detective work.

801
01:21:55,040 --> 01:21:59,580
I followed your instructions and
followed that magistrate for days.

802
01:21:59,910 --> 01:22:02,080
In the morning,
he goes to court.

803
01:22:02,250 --> 01:22:04,620
And in the evening roams around,
with his wife and kid...

804
01:22:04,750 --> 01:22:07,450
...at the beach and
expensive coffee shops.

805
01:22:07,450 --> 01:22:10,620
Wife and kid? Who were you
following all these days?

806
01:22:16,450 --> 01:22:18,500
Full family is there.
See the photo.

807
01:22:19,160 --> 01:22:23,040
You can enlarge it. How's it?

808
01:22:31,410 --> 01:22:35,450
Sudevan, I'll send a photo.
Ya, the same case.

809
01:22:35,910 --> 01:22:38,290
Trace that woman
and kid soon.

810
01:22:38,290 --> 01:22:41,120
Home, school or office.
Wherever it is, discreetly.

811
01:22:41,290 --> 01:22:43,290
Send someone with brains.

812
01:22:44,830 --> 01:22:48,160
Prosecution has failed to
establish that the accused...

813
01:22:48,330 --> 01:22:50,500
...has willfully committed
to the crime and...

814
01:22:57,040 --> 01:22:58,830
Call me when
you're done, sir.

815
01:23:03,870 --> 01:23:07,750
Police were at
Nitin's school for him.

816
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:12,950
They asked what's
his connection with you.

817
01:23:13,910 --> 01:23:16,120
I am scared.

818
01:23:18,290 --> 01:23:21,160
Don't worry.
I'll reach soon.

819
01:23:26,660 --> 01:23:30,000
They enquired about
me with the HRM.

820
01:23:30,540 --> 01:23:32,370
Again, about you.

821
01:23:34,200 --> 01:23:36,040
Nothing will happen.

822
01:23:36,580 --> 01:23:39,250
I've told everything to my chief Mr. Ajith.

823
01:23:39,870 --> 01:23:44,580
All investigations against both of you
will be called off immediately. I promise.

824
01:23:47,950 --> 01:23:51,120
But we need to find the truth
behind this as soon as possible.

825
01:23:51,620 --> 01:23:53,830
Let's go to Bangalore
with Nitin right away.

826
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,500
Are Sachin's files
in some locker?

827
01:24:03,870 --> 01:24:08,700
Sachin's editor.
He was everything to us.

828
01:24:09,410 --> 01:24:12,080
We had given everything to him.

829
01:24:12,410 --> 01:24:15,750
After retirement, he stays at Hoggenakal.

830
01:24:16,290 --> 01:24:20,620
I had called him.
But didn't say any of these.

831
01:24:22,290 --> 01:24:23,790
Hoggenakal...

832
01:24:24,450 --> 01:24:28,500
So it has to be by road.
But we shouldn't use our cars.

833
01:24:29,160 --> 01:24:30,160
Then?

834
01:24:32,660 --> 01:24:34,040
There's a way.

835
01:24:38,540 --> 01:24:42,040
Long trips are economical.
I always tell sir.

836
01:25:12,700 --> 01:25:16,040
Mobile is switched off.
We'll reach there early in the morning.

837
01:25:16,250 --> 01:25:19,580
I'm sure Nitin doesn't know
how he got these stories.

838
01:25:19,750 --> 01:25:24,450
But this deceased dad...
I don't know what to say, Baby.

839
01:25:25,250 --> 01:25:28,450
I just want to save Nitin from this tangle.

840
01:25:28,620 --> 01:25:31,620
What if we get some clue
from that man's files.

841
01:25:32,620 --> 01:25:33,830
Baby...

842
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:38,330
Sorry, Shalini. I'll call you later.
Just tell him.

843
01:25:45,700 --> 01:25:47,200
Do you like Parotta?

844
01:25:54,250 --> 01:25:55,580
Did you order?

845
01:26:00,910 --> 01:26:04,290
Poor kid!
He's enjoying this trip.

846
01:26:31,910 --> 01:26:34,620
"Story's burning like a fire..."

847
01:26:34,750 --> 01:26:38,790
"See the shadow lying
Lying on the fire"

848
01:27:25,540 --> 01:27:26,540
Come here, kid

849
01:27:27,580 --> 01:27:28,870
How are you feeling?

850
01:27:37,910 --> 01:27:40,790
- Hello. Mathias Pandya
- John Baby.

851
01:27:42,290 --> 01:27:43,120
Come in.

852
01:27:53,160 --> 01:27:56,540
He's Bahauddin.
Great chef!

853
01:27:57,200 --> 01:27:59,700
Can we have fish
in the afternoon?

854
01:28:00,540 --> 01:28:03,040
Fresh fish from Kaveri river.

855
01:28:36,200 --> 01:28:37,080
Sharmi...

856
01:28:42,410 --> 01:28:44,250
I can't look at it.

857
01:28:45,290 --> 01:28:47,120
You please go through them, John.

858
01:28:47,450 --> 01:28:48,750
I'll do it.

859
01:28:49,410 --> 01:28:51,620
The computers have passwords?

860
01:28:51,790 --> 01:28:57,160
The police had cracked it during
the investigation. Now there's nothing.

861
01:29:11,410 --> 01:29:12,580
Come on.

862
01:29:34,540 --> 01:29:35,700
Hey, look there

863
01:30:10,200 --> 01:30:12,000
Look at that.
See, mom.

864
01:31:43,160 --> 01:31:44,330
Bebo!

865
01:31:51,200 --> 01:31:53,040
I went boating

866
01:31:53,870 --> 01:31:55,700
- How was it?
- I enjoyed a lot

867
01:32:05,450 --> 01:32:09,410
I'm sure. What Nitin says are
not stories from Sachin.

868
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,200
Grenache 1972.

869
01:32:32,580 --> 01:32:35,040
Son, do you like beef curry?

870
01:32:38,910 --> 01:32:42,290
Fish from Kaveri,
Great chef, Alladin...

871
01:32:42,290 --> 01:32:44,290
- Bahauddin.
- Yeah, Bahauddin. That only.

872
01:32:44,290 --> 01:32:47,830
I thought it would be
a big deal. This is some...

873
01:33:04,410 --> 01:33:06,870
I've decided to move to Europe.

874
01:33:09,950 --> 01:33:13,290
Whatever is haunting him
is in this land.

875
01:33:14,290 --> 01:33:16,910
Over there,
he'll forget everything.

876
01:33:19,330 --> 01:33:20,830
Malayalam too.

877
01:34:46,200 --> 01:34:48,540
'He was everything to us.'

878
01:35:11,540 --> 01:35:15,370
[Garbled sounds]

879
01:36:12,040 --> 01:36:18,870
[Whispers] Choked his neck
and killed.

880
01:36:21,370 --> 01:36:31,620
Nothing in the world is
stronger than the final struggle.

881
01:37:42,290 --> 01:37:45,120
Ma'am, sir returned
early in the morning.

882
01:37:45,120 --> 01:37:48,000
He got a call about
some urgent case in the court.

883
01:37:48,160 --> 01:37:51,500
He asked you both to
return at your convenience.

884
01:38:16,120 --> 01:38:20,160
Are you sure that Sharmila isn't
aware that she is the problem?

885
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:22,120
Else?

886
01:38:22,830 --> 01:38:26,160
Will someone in their right mind
tell such stories to their kid?

887
01:38:26,330 --> 01:38:29,200
So the kid doesn't know
it's from his mom? Great!

888
01:38:31,700 --> 01:38:34,580
What his subconscious mind
registers during sleep...

889
01:38:34,700 --> 01:38:37,700
...is being recreated
somehow when awake.

890
01:38:39,540 --> 01:38:43,580
Sharmila also must have heard
stories in a similar manner.

891
01:38:43,910 --> 01:38:45,290
In her childhood.

892
01:38:55,830 --> 01:38:59,370
So, that's the secret behind
the age of these murders.

893
01:39:32,160 --> 01:39:33,330
Sir...

894
01:39:34,370 --> 01:39:36,500
It's late.
Should I stay back?

895
01:39:38,870 --> 01:39:40,540
No, Valsala.
You may leave.

896
01:40:08,040 --> 01:40:11,700
Will you get leave easily here,
like in government service?

897
01:40:13,370 --> 01:40:16,410
Isn't there any legal penalty
for such poor jokes?

898
01:40:28,120 --> 01:40:29,450
What happened?

899
01:40:29,910 --> 01:40:33,660
Leaving in the middle of the night,
not answering calls...

900
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:38,160
Nitin was quite sad. Is it some
international legal problem?

901
01:40:49,410 --> 01:40:52,910
Nitin got those stories
from you, Sharmila.

902
01:40:56,580 --> 01:40:57,910
What?

903
01:41:00,790 --> 01:41:02,450
What did you say, John?

904
01:41:11,830 --> 01:41:14,700
Those are stories which
you said during your sleep.

905
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:19,830
Sharmila...

906
01:42:23,540 --> 01:42:24,700
Here, have this.

907
01:42:30,040 --> 01:42:33,080
Shalini will pick Nitin
from the school in the evening.

908
01:42:54,160 --> 01:42:56,700
Is there something wrong with me?

909
01:42:59,870 --> 01:43:02,750
I was the one who was
asking this question for a while.

910
01:43:03,700 --> 01:43:04,910
Drink it first.

911
01:43:06,700 --> 01:43:08,040
This isn't like that.

912
01:43:10,080 --> 01:43:11,790
My child...

913
01:43:13,290 --> 01:43:14,290
Hey...

914
01:43:14,450 --> 01:43:17,660
You have heard these stories
from someone as a kid.

915
01:43:17,950 --> 01:43:21,330
That's still somewhere
inside your mind. That's all.

916
01:43:22,330 --> 01:43:25,330
What's all? Don't say
hollow words, John.

917
01:44:10,910 --> 01:44:14,910
If I investigate it myself, someone
who's tailing me will find out. That's why.

918
01:44:15,410 --> 01:44:17,250
You tell me the thing.

919
01:44:19,120 --> 01:44:20,450
It's about Sharmila.

920
01:44:21,290 --> 01:44:25,450
I need the details of her deceased mom.

921
01:44:30,660 --> 01:44:34,540
How many times I told you, John.
Mom was an ordinary government employee.

922
01:44:34,540 --> 01:44:36,200
A clerk at the water authority.

923
01:44:37,200 --> 01:44:39,370
How will she tell
murder stories?

924
01:44:39,540 --> 01:44:43,750
Dad died before I was two.
He was also a clerk at LIC.

925
01:44:44,910 --> 01:44:48,750
If you repeat the questions,
will any of these change?

926
01:45:01,160 --> 01:45:04,830
Shouldn't we get to the root of this?
That's why I...

927
01:45:06,660 --> 01:45:09,700
Any other close relatives,
family friends?

928
01:45:12,870 --> 01:45:15,910
I swear, there is no one
in my memory.

929
01:45:17,580 --> 01:45:20,870
Those stories are also
not in your memory, right?

930
01:45:29,790 --> 01:45:30,790
Hello.

931
01:46:06,330 --> 01:46:08,160
It'll end with this.
Right, Baby?

932
01:46:09,620 --> 01:46:12,040
Don't know if this is
the end or the beginning.

933
01:46:30,580 --> 01:46:33,290
We need to go somewhere.
Can you get out now?

934
01:46:33,290 --> 01:46:34,120
To where?

935
01:46:34,120 --> 01:46:37,500
I'll send location details in whatsapp.
I'll be there now.

936
01:48:00,160 --> 01:48:03,410
Is it for photocopy?
If it's a book, leave it here.

937
01:48:03,580 --> 01:48:05,410
I'll keep it ready tomorrow.

938
01:48:09,910 --> 01:48:13,290
The machine is young.
I can't run along.

939
01:48:14,910 --> 01:48:16,290
Viswanathan?

940
01:48:23,660 --> 01:48:24,660
Ya.

941
01:48:27,160 --> 01:48:28,870
Do you recognise her?

942
01:48:31,870 --> 01:48:33,000
Sharmila.

943
01:48:40,250 --> 01:48:41,410
Radhamani's...

944
01:48:52,500 --> 01:48:55,160
He wasn't just my mom's colleague.

945
01:48:55,830 --> 01:48:59,000
He was always around for everything.

946
01:48:59,660 --> 01:49:04,040
Even when she died, he was the one
active more than my relatives.

947
01:49:05,040 --> 01:49:07,700
Slowly we lost touch.

948
01:49:09,580 --> 01:49:12,540
After growing up,
I've wondered...

949
01:49:12,910 --> 01:49:15,910
...whether they were in love.

950
01:49:16,580 --> 01:49:17,790
Baby.

951
01:49:18,620 --> 01:49:20,120
He is conscious.

952
01:49:52,250 --> 01:49:53,290
Your son?

953
01:49:58,290 --> 01:50:02,160
He's a spitting image
of Radhamma. Come.

954
01:50:06,660 --> 01:50:07,660
Come on

955
01:50:14,700 --> 01:50:16,200
I'm Dr. Shalini.

956
01:50:17,080 --> 01:50:23,750
I wanted to ask you about some things
Sharmila heard in her sleep as a child.

957
01:50:29,910 --> 01:50:30,950
What?

958
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:35,330
Uncle...

959
01:50:36,160 --> 01:50:38,330
Listen to me carefully.

960
01:50:40,830 --> 01:50:42,700
This is very serious.

961
01:50:43,870 --> 01:50:49,910
Those things she heard as a child
lie deep in her subconscious mind.

962
01:50:50,580 --> 01:50:55,250
Some murders from
around 30 years back.

963
01:50:57,250 --> 01:51:00,450
Like her, it is being passed
on to her son in sleep.

964
01:51:05,620 --> 01:51:08,830
We know every vicious act
you committed.

965
01:51:22,200 --> 01:51:23,410
You...

966
01:51:24,580 --> 01:51:26,410
Weren't you asleep,
dear?

967
01:51:37,290 --> 01:51:38,950
Who's that old man?

968
01:51:41,330 --> 01:51:43,330
Another story teller like you.

969
01:51:47,870 --> 01:51:50,700
I haven't done
anything personally.

970
01:51:52,200 --> 01:51:54,700
It was to eliminate
the enemies of the party.

971
01:51:55,870 --> 01:51:59,540
That too, not directly.
Just coordination.

972
01:52:00,250 --> 01:52:05,450
Arranging the place,
occasion and people.

973
01:52:10,120 --> 01:52:15,160
I was the union leader.
Young and ambitious too.

974
01:52:15,660 --> 01:52:18,120
Didn't feel any hesitation.

975
01:52:19,660 --> 01:52:25,000
Since Radhamani got posted there,
I had some other dreams for the first time.

976
01:52:25,370 --> 01:52:31,410
She too liked it. But it wasn't
long since her husband died.

977
01:52:31,750 --> 01:52:34,750
What would relatives and
people around think?

978
01:52:35,080 --> 01:52:37,080
The times were such.

979
01:52:39,120 --> 01:52:41,290
Not so much different from now.

980
01:52:42,290 --> 01:52:48,660
Since Radhamma came to my mind,
I began to feel guilty about what I did.

981
01:52:49,500 --> 01:52:55,700
Some nights, in a heavily drunken state
I'll go to Radhamma's house.

982
01:52:56,200 --> 01:53:00,700
I'll cry and talk till I get some peace.

983
01:53:01,700 --> 01:53:07,750
She'll sit and hear everything
with the kid sleeping on her lap.

984
01:53:09,080 --> 01:53:10,750
Not saying anything.

985
01:53:15,080 --> 01:53:17,290
You were everything for her.

986
01:53:21,160 --> 01:53:24,450
Even after she passed away,
I haven't forgotten you.

987
01:53:24,830 --> 01:53:30,040
I had a feeling that you will be
leading a happy life somewhere.

988
01:53:32,040 --> 01:53:33,660
May be it's right.

989
01:53:35,580 --> 01:53:37,910
Party's insistence,
for the party.

990
01:53:38,580 --> 01:53:40,410
But they are all murders.

991
01:53:42,250 --> 01:53:45,120
Tomorrow upon discharge,
the police will arrest you.

992
01:53:47,250 --> 01:53:48,620
Believe me.

993
01:53:49,450 --> 01:53:52,120
I haven't done anything
with my hands.

994
01:53:52,660 --> 01:53:56,000
Save your confessions
for the police and court.

995
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:09,910
- Will you hold my bag, uncle?
- How heavy is it, man!

996
01:54:10,580 --> 01:54:13,750
Are you studying anything?
Or just playing 'Angry birds'?

997
01:54:13,910 --> 01:54:15,250
No.

998
01:54:15,410 --> 01:54:17,290
I used to be 'Angry birds'
top scorer.

999
01:54:18,450 --> 01:54:20,750
I had a video conference.

1000
01:54:21,910 --> 01:54:24,450
Let him come with us.
I'll drop back later.

1001
01:54:50,250 --> 01:54:53,950
I'll drop you at the bus stand.
Don't stay here any longer, uncle.

1002
01:54:54,750 --> 01:54:56,450
Dear, the police...

1003
01:54:57,290 --> 01:55:01,160
Now nobody knows.
You go somewhere before that.

1004
01:55:06,160 --> 01:55:09,540
Else perhaps
mom will be sad.

1005
01:55:34,790 --> 01:55:35,660
Hello.

1006
01:55:38,330 --> 01:55:39,330
No need.

1007
01:55:41,200 --> 01:55:44,370
You had left barehanded.
You'll need it.

1008
01:55:44,870 --> 01:55:46,660
Sure, I'll update.

1009
01:55:50,750 --> 01:55:52,580
He has left
the hospital.

1010
01:55:54,540 --> 01:55:56,910
Couldn't find him when
they went to change the drip.

1011
01:55:58,120 --> 01:56:01,620
Leave him. Why have police
and army in this old age?

1012
01:56:01,790 --> 01:56:03,620
How will you prove these?

1013
01:56:03,660 --> 01:56:09,330
You can imagine in what positions now
those who made him do all these will be.

1014
01:56:09,500 --> 01:56:14,540
If they want, they will strike down
him, you and even me.

1015
01:56:15,040 --> 01:56:16,370
What else!

1016
01:56:18,540 --> 01:56:21,370
Hatchu dear...
Let's play.

1017
01:56:53,370 --> 01:56:55,540
Hatchu dear...
Eat.

1018
01:57:03,750 --> 01:57:04,910
Bebo.

1019
01:57:04,950 --> 01:57:09,910
The old man at the hospital mentioned
one Radhamma, right? Who's that?

1020
01:57:10,120 --> 01:57:13,000
She's someone related
to you. Why?

1021
01:57:17,160 --> 01:57:18,330
What's it?

1022
01:57:20,540 --> 01:57:23,500
I know the story about
how a Radhamma was killed.

1023
01:57:53,500 --> 01:57:58,700
Radhamani had insisted on
ending the deadly politics.

1024
01:58:03,250 --> 01:58:04,910
I couldn't.

1025
01:58:06,200 --> 01:58:07,700
At last...

1026
01:58:09,410 --> 01:58:15,410
When I felt she will go away from me
and let out my secrets...

1027
01:58:20,500 --> 01:58:22,330
Radhamma's life...

1028
01:58:23,160 --> 01:58:25,000
As she writhed...

1029
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:28,160
She gazed at me last...

1030
01:58:30,700 --> 01:58:33,370
After the cremation, everyone left.

1031
01:58:33,870 --> 01:58:41,250
My heart hurt to see you sleeping tired
from crying in Radhamma's room.

1032
01:58:44,450 --> 01:58:51,290
Like I used to tell Radhamma,
I sat at your feet and confessed.

1033
01:58:52,290 --> 01:58:55,660
That was my mistake.

1034
01:58:57,660 --> 01:58:59,330
Believe me...

1035
01:58:59,830 --> 01:59:02,540
I haven't done anything
with my hands.

1036
01:59:04,200 --> 01:59:08,040
Maybe not to forget
what you did to my mom...

1037
01:59:08,540 --> 01:59:15,250
...my mind remembered
stories of other murders.

1038
01:59:16,080 --> 01:59:23,580
With mom's asthma and your political influence,
things were easy. Right?

1039
01:59:30,160 --> 01:59:33,000
'We know every vicious act
you committed.'

1040
01:59:33,370 --> 01:59:35,500
'Weren't you asleep, dear?'

1041
01:59:50,080 --> 01:59:56,120
That doctor girl said your son
also knows those stories.

1042
02:01:18,040 --> 02:01:19,370
Let her go

1043
02:02:32,200 --> 02:02:36,410
Dear, if you take it to school
give only to your close friends.

1044
02:02:36,750 --> 02:02:38,290
Cool, granny!

1045
02:02:42,910 --> 02:02:44,000
Careful.

1046
02:02:47,500 --> 02:02:48,330
Let's go.

1047
02:02:52,830 --> 02:02:54,660
You please insist.

1048
02:02:55,040 --> 02:02:58,160
Tell him to meet.
Maybe he'll agree.

1049
02:02:59,500 --> 02:03:03,910
That girl is now assistant professor
at Law College. Her mom is a lawyer.

1050
02:03:04,250 --> 02:03:06,870
So, they are all his tribe.

1051
02:03:07,580 --> 02:03:08,580
I'll tell him.

1052
02:03:10,620 --> 02:03:11,620
Go.

1053
02:03:12,450 --> 02:03:13,290
