Srivatsan called me

27
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,030
Silencer?

28
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,310
He said Pari is here

29
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,432
Pari?!!

30
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,035
lf we want to meet Pari, he asked us to
be at our college water tank at 8:00 a.m

31
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,398

in mid air to come back now

32
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:32,917
- Oh crap!

33
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,474

Amnesia or fashion!?

00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,510

Brother will be waiting for you
Take him to Andhra club

He is also Ramba Rao!

00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,238
Pari....

59
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,868

00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,068
Tell me. Where's Pari?

00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,959

Where is Pari

66
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,519
First check this out

67
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,116
Super!

68
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,877
l didn't ask you to praise my wife

69
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:17,837
See the bungalow behind her
4 million U.S dollars

70
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,073
- l am talking about bungalow
- Wife is average looking!

71
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,394
Swimming pool...heated

72
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,314
Living room
Maple wood flooring

73
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:34,835
My new Lamborghini 6496cc

74
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,595
Why are you showing all this
to us like a real estate agent?

75
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,352
Where is Pari?

76
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,477
Did you guys forget?
Come with me

77
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:43,631
Where's he off to?

78
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,431
Mark this date, guys

79
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,078
10 years later we'll meet here
same day...same place

80
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,671
We'll see who's made it big then

81
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,839
lt's a challenge. Will you be here?

82
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,509
lf you have the guts
agree to this deal

83
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,390
Do you remember?

84
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,873
l wagered a bet with that
smart-ass in this same place

85
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,991
l am a MAN, l won
You good-for-nothing losers!

86
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,392
Hit you!

87
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,192
Shameless fellow

88
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,480
l got down from a flight in mid air!
He forgot to even wear his pants

89
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:28,951
For past 10 years we've been
hunting for our friend Pari

90
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,635
We don't even know
if he is alive or not

91
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,673
Did you ask us to come here
to humor your ego?!

92
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:33,597
Chill, dude

93
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,195
l knew he won't be here

94
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,512
He's rubbing salt
on to our wounds!

95
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,710
Let's push him down

96
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,599
Venkat! Let go

97
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,955
Why did you ask us to come here?

98
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:44,956
To meet Pari

99
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,755
Lets go check
if he's a big shot or l am

100
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,912
Which means...
you know where he is?

101
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,277
Yes

102
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,150
Where is Pari?

103
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,637
He's in Ootacamund

104
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,991
Don't get it? Ooty!

105
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:29,790
No one can emulate my friend
He changed every fad and trend

106
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:34,758
Buddy, where did you disappear?

107
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,433
Daily we longed for our friend so dear

108
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:44,313
He embroidered our hearts in friendship

109
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,714
He made us teary-eyed with his kinship

110
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:13,395
Like a mother's lap is his shoulder

111
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,913
He's our umbilical cord linked far

112
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,716
Friendship beyond love so true

113
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:27,155
more than a flight of steps it grew

114
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,198
Your friendship is our treasure

115
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,597
You developed in us a new picture

116
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,793
We flew so high

117
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,351
like fluffy clouds in the sky

118
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,917
Paving our path with a new bouquet

119
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:45,910
why did you abandon us halfway?

120
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:50,437
Like a child searching for his mother

121
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,708
without you how can we go farther?!

122
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,114
No one can emulate my friend

123
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,799
He changed every fad and trend

124
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,640
Buddy, where did you disappear?

125
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,190
Daily we longed for our friend so dear

126
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,197
Pari

127
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,596
Panchavan Parivedthan

128
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,550
As unique as his name

129
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:25,958
What our teachers and parents didn't
in 20 years, he taught us in just 4 years!

130
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,517
He identified myself to me!

131
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,429
Life is a marathon

132
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,156
lf we don't run fast enough
others will overtake us!

133
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:38,154
Even to be born we have to
compete with 300 million sperms!

134
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,189
l was born in 1980 at 10:20 a.m

135
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,838
At 10:21 my dad announced,
''l've got an engineer-son''!

136
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,038
Venkat Ramakrishnan B.E

137
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,559
And my fate was sealed

138
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,273
But no one asked me
what l wanted to be!

139
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,597
Sevarkodi Senthil
Venkat Ramakrishnan

140

To buy tea & coffee, wash & iron clothes,

146
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,309
But studying is up to you

147
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,149
Fixed rate , No bargain

148
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,870
Hey! Millimeter
One minute

00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,228
You want to click snaps?

00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,119
This is kilobyte
This is mega byte

Oi! Out

00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,553
Hey! Millimeter
What's your meter?!

160
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,876
To carry 1 box for 1 km is Rs 2

00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:04,478
- For 2 boxes 2 kms Rs 8
- Here's a tenner For You

Okay...fine

Boss you are great

00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,073
Our seniors made us fall
at their feet, in our briefs

167
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,391
Though l fell at our seniors' feet
l looked up to see Pari's face!

168
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,594
That was my 1st glimpse of Pari

169
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:57,990
- Boss

170
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:58,951

00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,631
What sort of a name is this?

176
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,270
King Pari who gave up
his chariot for a creeper

177
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,316
Now give your pants to our boss

178

184
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,550
All is well

185
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:45,917
Are you a Christian?

186
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,635
Hey! James Bond!

187
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:52,717
Tell him what to do

188
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,917
Take off your pants, man
Or he'll piss on you

189
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,670
Why are you showing off
your Engish now?

190
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,278
l was born in Coimbatore
l studied in California

191
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,999
So little slow in Tamil

192
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,870
There's no rush
You can show off your Tamil

193
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,156
Why did you get into
your pants so soon?

194
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:14,878
Strip!

195
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,392
Remove your trousers

196
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,668
Otherwise he will bless you
with his 'pees-ful' offering!

197
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,238
Peaceful offering?

198
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,156
- What language is this?
- Archaic Thamizh!

199
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,709
Oi! Come out

200
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,434
lf you don't...
on your door...

201
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,276
...l'll pee

202
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,394
l'll count till 10

203
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:11,513
lf you don't come, l'll pee in front of
your door through out this semester

204
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:13,917
One

205
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,192
Two

206
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,112
Three

207
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,117
Four

208
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:28,992
Five

209
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:33,558
Six

210
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:36,792
Seven

211
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:42,278
Eight

212
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:45,477
Nine

213
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,392
Ten

214
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,073
Boss, you are great
Bless me

215
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,912
Salt water is a great conductor of electricity

216
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,709
We learnt that in 8th grade as theory

217
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,434
Pari applied it practically

218
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:54,749
Dr Virumandi Sandanam

219
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,635
Our college principal

220
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,997
Students fondly call him 'Virus'

221
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:04,869
Life was all about competitions
He never wished anyone to win

222
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:06,910
Time is precious to him

223
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:10,313
So much so, his shirts have
no buttons, only velcro!

224
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,999
He doesn't tie a tie
He wears it!

225
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:19,117
He's ambidextrous
like actor Rajini in the film Sivaji!

226
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:22,280
He even tries to write with
both his feet at the same time

227
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,230
After lunch he takes a power nap
for exactly 7 1/2 minutes

228
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,192
Even then, he makes use of that time
by putting up with unproductive work!

229
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:37,953
Strict orders to Govindhan to cut his nails,
shave, tweeze his nostril hair during break

230
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,396
Virus is bringing eggs for us
All of you come out

231
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:53,718
What is this?

232
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:54,791
- Cuckoo, sir

233
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,152
..And this?

234
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:57,951
Cuckoo's nest

235
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,032
Wrong

236
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,389
Cuckoo never builds her own nest

237
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,355
Do you know where a cuckoo lays her nest?

238
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,639
Always in a crow's nest

239
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,836
First day and he keeps talking of
cuckoos, crows and ciphers!

240
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,793
Seems like a bad omen!

241
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:16,348
When the eggs hatch,
do you know what happens?

242
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:23,870
Cuckoo's young ones
push the crows' eggs down

243
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:28,511
Competition is over

244
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,278
Life begins with murder

245
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:32,911
That is nature

246
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,677
Compete or die

247
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,675
You are like this cuckoo

248
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,795
These are crow's eggs
that you pushed down

249
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:50,396
Don't forget...every year we get
4 lakh applications to this college

250
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,912
Only 200 get selected

251
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:53,953
You are part of the 200

252
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,715
Others are broken eggs

253
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:06,911
My own son applied thrice
He ended up as a broken egg

254
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,993
Life is a race
You've got to run fast

255
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,437
Otherwise the one behind you
will trample and overtake you

256
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,796
Let me tell you a very interesting story

257
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,315
This is an astronaut's pen

258
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:27,230
Due to lack of gravity in outer space
ball point and fountain pens don't function

259
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:32,595
Many scientists at the expense of
many million dollars, have invented this pen

260
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:36,952
This space pen can be used at
any temperature at whatever angle

261
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:42,276
One day, when l was a student
our director called me

262
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:43,591
Virumandi Sandanam

263
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,474
Yes, sir
Come here

264
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:46,831
l got scared

265
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,999
He showed me this pen and said...

266
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,833
'This is a symbol of excellence
l'm gifting it to you

267
00:18:54,880 --> 00:19:00,477
The day you find an extra-ordinary
student like you, give this to him'

268
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:07,832
l am waiting to do so for past 32 years
l'm yet to find such a student

269
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:12,115
At least in this batch will one of you
be worthy of this pen?

270
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,795
Yes, sir

271
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,596
Hands down

272
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,195
Should l announce specially for you?

273
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:30,313
Sir, l have a doubt?
-ask

274
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,956
lf a pen didn't write in space
they could have used a pencil!

275
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,476
lt would have only cost Rs2!!!

276
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:45,472
Disperse

277
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,954
Time for class to begin

278
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,116
Oi! He's a real tough cookie!

279
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,479
Yesterday, he taught our seniors a lesson

280
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,833
Today, he made Virus speechless

281
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,189
We must be on our guard with him

282
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,957
You gave Virus himself a nasty medicine!

283
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,880
Boss, you are great
Bless me

284
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,953
Get up

285
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:15,949
You're not going to school?

286
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,515
lt's your father who pays?

287
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,279
Let him go
He's just a kid

288
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,710
You don't need fees
to study in a school

289
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,310
Just an uniform will do

290
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:32,593
Whichever school you like
get that uniform stitched

291
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,555
Sit in that class room
without uttering a single word

292
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,953
Who will find you out
in this crowd?

293
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:37,717
But if they do?

294
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,918
Change school
and change uniform

295
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:44,917
Did you hear that?

296
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,269
He has something...a spark!

297
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,038
He looks at ordinary stuff
in a totally new perspective

298
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,355
ln Virus's cuckoo flock
he stood apart as a peacock!

299
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:00,038
We were all professor's robots!
He was the only human amongst us

300
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,635
What is a machine?

301
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,109
What are you rejoicing?

302
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:11,990
My dream from childhood
is to become an engineer, sir

303
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:16,350
l am so happy to be here

304
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:20,116
Enough of being happy!
Define a machine

305
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:25,991
Sir, a machine is anything
that reduces human effort

306
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,669
Can you please elaborate?

307
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:37,557
Sir, whatever gadget makes time
and human effort easier is a machine

308
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:42,319
When we sweat,
we tap a switch

309
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,070
Fan...machine, sir!

310
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,992
lf we want to talk
to our friend far away

311
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,548
Phone...machine, sir

312
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,155
We are surrounded by machines!

313
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,758
From a pen's nib to a pant zip
it's a 'machine' world

314
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,269
One second up,
next second down

315
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,919
Up down
Up down

316
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:02,671
What's the definition?

317
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,312
That's what l was saying now

318
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,075
ls this what you'll write in your exam?

319
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:10,477
ls this a machine?

320
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,029
Up down
up down

321
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:13,672
ldiot!

322
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,031
Anybody else?

323
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:15,593
Sir?

324
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,271
Machines are any combination
of bodies so connected...

325
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:23,195
...that their relative motions are constrained
and by means of which force and motion

326
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:27,792
...may be transmitted and modified
as a screw and its nut or a lever arranged to turn

327
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,993
about a forearm or a pulley
about its pivot etc...

328
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,870
Especially a construction
more or less complex

329
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,117
consisting of a combination of moving parts...

330
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,515
...or simple mechanical elements

331
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:40,036
such as wheels, levers, cams etc

332
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,191
V.V.Good!

333
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:43,278
Perfect

334
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,391
Thank you sir

335
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,232
Please sit down

336
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,549
This is what l too said

337
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,919
...in simple terms

338
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,036
for everyone to grasp

339
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,788
You should then join a Govt. Arts college

340
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,755
But we should be able to understand
whatever we study, right sir?

341
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:04,036
What's the use of blindly
memorizing what's in our syllabus?

342
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,799
Oh! So you claim to be more
intelligent than these books?

343
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,510
lf you want to pass the exams
this is what you have to write

344
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,433
l just wan...
-Get out

345
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,399
lf you need to be told
in simple terms...get out!

346
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:22,397
ldiot!

347
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,956
So you got the definition of a machine

348
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:33,551
A machine is a combination of various elements
or links used to transform otherforms of energy into

349
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,388
Why are you back here?

350
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,518
l forgot, sir

351
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:38,272
What did you forget?

352
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:43,029
lnstruments that record, analyze, summarize,
organize, debate and explain information

353
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:46,716
...that are illustrated, non-illustrated, hard bound,
paperback, jacketed or non jacketed...

354
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,791
...with forward, introduction,
table of contents, index

355
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,316
that are intended for the
enlightenment, understanding

356
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,431
...enrichment, enhancement
and education of

357
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,398
the human brain through
sensory route of vision

358
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:57,317
...sometimes touch

359
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:08,238
Means?

360
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:10,756
Book, sir

361
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,512
Definition by the book

362
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:16,710
l forgot to take my books

363
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:17,716
That's why l came back

364
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,433
Why didn't you give this same
simple explanation earlier?

365
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,393
That's what l tried, sir...but

366
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,552
You don't like anything simplified!

367
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,156
Pari was an outstanding student

368
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:34,915
He'll forever be standing

369
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,835
None of the professors
liked the questions he asked

370
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,235
They'll immediately shoo him
out of the class

371
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,833
He'll promptly go and sit
in our seniors' class

372
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,390
When asked why, he'll philosophize that
knowledge can be sought in any level!

373
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,870
Similar to Pari in ideology
was Paneer Selvam

374
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,277
- Excuse me, sir

375
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,436
- Tell me, Paneer Selvam

376
00:24:58,800 --> 00:24:59,869
When's our convocation?

377
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:00,598
Why?

378
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,832
So that my parents
can come from my village, sir

379
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:06,152
l need to book train tickets for them
l am the 1st engineer from our village

380
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,948
Even my relatives want to come

381
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,549
1st call your dad

382
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,038
Please, please, hurry up
Don't waste my time

383
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:16,592
Hello

384
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:17,876
Father, l'm Paneer speaking

385
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,396
How are you, my son?

386
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,476
l am fine

387
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:25,030
Siva Prakasam, your son won't
become an engineer this year

388
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,790
So don't book tickets
and waste your money

389
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:29,796
Why, sir?

390
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,679
He didn't get his project ready in time

391
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,869
He didn't like the project l suggested
Of his own accord he chose to make

392
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:40,276
a toy helicopter that kids play with

393
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:41,829
He's a good student, sir

394
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,515
Hey! Listen to me
lt's very unrealistic

395
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,790
and it won't work

396
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:53,596
You might as well start a poultry farm for him
At least he can watch a cock fly!!!

397
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,079
l am in the completion stage

398
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:00,957
ls your project ready?

399
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,589
Just see my project once, sir

400
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,676
Submit it
l'll see it

401
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,513
Just give me some grace time
l'll submit it, sir

402
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:08,795
Why should l give you extension?

403
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,912
My father had a heart attack
and was hospitalized

404
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,758
l couldn't concentrate
in my studies, sir

405
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,389
Did you stop eating for 2 months?

406
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:19,317
No, sir

407
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,070
No, sir

408
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,711
Sunday morning, my son
died in a train accident

409
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,196
Monday morning l came to college

410
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,434
1st hour class in 'digital principles'

411
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,197
So don't give me
that bullshit Paneer Selvam

412
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:35,909
l can only feel sorry for you

413
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,799
l cannot give you an extension

414
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:38,632
Sir?

415
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:39,792
Go quit

416
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,352
Very close, sir

417
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:21,070
Right in front of my own eyes
l disappeared into thin air

418
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:30,631
l dissolved as an unseen star
now here...nowhere!

419
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:40,950
l hear my heart tatter threadbare
l didn't expect this nightmare

420
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:55,070
l hear my heart tatter threadbare
l didn't expect this nightmare

421
00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:00,119
l ask for rain, a few splashes
instead you reduce me to ashes

422
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:05,276
l ask for ray of light, few
my eyes, you take in lieu!

423
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:13,116
my dreams you stopped midway
will you let me continue somehow?

424
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:22,834
Pain and strain you piled on me
will you let me sleep now?

425
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,475
So well designed

426
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,673
Wireless camera on a helicopter

427
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,237
Useful for traffic update and security

428
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:40,552
Virus claims it won't fly
and this project is a failure

429
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,590
Why won't it fly?
We'll make it fly

430
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:48,592
Paneer ls almost there
Given a little more time

431
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:49,829
he'd have done it

432
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,236
Let it be a surprise to him
We'll make it fly

433
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:57,551
in front of his window
...and watch his reaction

434
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,795
from below on this screen

435
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,310
This is just excess baggage!

436
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,556
lf we do his assignment
who will do ours ?

437
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,915
Already we are flooded
with viva...test...quiz!

438
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,958
42 exams in every semester

439
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,598
Give me your hand
Place it on your heart

440
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:15,991
Repeat to yourself

441
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:16,916
All is well

442
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,549
All is well

443
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,833
Swami Pariyanandha
is chanting a new mantra

444
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:27,672
That means?

445
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,719
All is well means
it's all for the good

446
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,237
Positive thought
that only good will happen

447
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:37,075
ln our town there was a watchman
called Mariam Suzai

448
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:45,236
As soon as the sun sets
he will yell 'All is wellllllllll'

449
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:46,950
We'll all sleep peacefully

450
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,148
One night there was a burglary

451
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:54,350
Only then we knew our bro
was suffering from night blindness!

452
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:59,557
His 'all is well' slogan gave us
peace of mind to sleep in peace

453
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,430
l got enlightened that day

454
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:08,071
Our heart is a scaredy cat
Chicken hearted

455
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:09,712
Like him

456
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,678
We must bluff to our heart

457
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,632
However huge a problem
comes our way...

458
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:19,112
...we should tell our heart
'Chillax! All is well'

459
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,958
That will solve
all our problems?!

460
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:25,672
We'll get more courage
to face our problems

461
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,871
Remember this mantra
lt will come in handy for sure

462
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:01,471
lf heart's battery low in level
Charge it with 'all is well'

463
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:05,311
Defeat or distress spell
Dictum is 'all is well'

464
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,117
lf heart's battery low in level
Charge it with 'all is well'

465
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:17,071
Defeat or distress spell
Dictum is 'all is well'

466
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:20,633
lf your life gets too tight
loosen up to set it right

467
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:25,274
lf you live a bat's life, upside down
earth is hanging garden of Babylon

468
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:28,518
Thread in the doughnut of lentil
Tagline is 'all is well'

469
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,158
Bring that thread
to fly a kite overhead

470
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,432
lf on 31st there's cigarette shortage
'all is well' should be your adage

471
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:39,117
Beedi will do
to bond us true

472
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:44,356
lf heart's battery low in level
Charge it with 'all is well'

473
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:48,311
Defeat or distress spell
Dictum is 'all is well'

474
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:52,076
lf your life gets too tight
loosen up to set it right

475
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:56,514
lf you live a bat's life, upside down
earth is hanging garden of Babylon

476
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:59,718
Thread in the doughnut of lentil

477
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,478

479
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,357
Beedi will do
to bond us true

480
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:46,877
Hey there! White shirt guy
Book in your hand...why?

481
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:50,159
Are you well read?
Don't show-off, pinhead!

482
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:54,637
Hey! Dude! Hear me out
lt's foolish to learn by rote

483
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,519
Are you a stork
waiting for its prey?

484
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,757
Don't obsess
about marks and pray

485
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:02,278
Like a marble stuck in a soda bottle
should lessons choke at full throttle?

486
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:06,116
To overload your upper storey
is your brain a mere lorry?

487
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:10,311
Pack up your brains, seal it neat
Follow the route of your heart beat

488
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:13,958
Class topper isn't a hero marvel
Catch word is 'all is well'

489
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:17,912
Hero can become zero
'All is well' is your motto

490
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:21,877
Joker isn't of zero nature
'All is well' your signature!

491
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,551
ln a deck of cards
he's the hero for sure!

492

Beat on the desk
in harmony

496
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:19,913
Rock and roll
in tune with your soul

497
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:24,357
Should every student
be a jail-bird?

498
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,432
Sim trapped in a mobile
can they be captured?

499
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,558
Let's escape unhindered!

500
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:32,032
lf no latch on the restroom door
hum a song with its encore

501
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:35,957
You'll become number one priority
sought after singer celebrity

502
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,190
Lock up your brains, seal it neat
Follow the route of your heart beat

503
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:43,798
lnto your room if a snake does slither

504
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:46,511
Wave your exam paper it will disappear

505
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:51,671
lf you get a paunch with too much beer
'All is well' you must whisper

506
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,311
You'll be the perfect inspector!

507
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:59,630
lf heart's battery low in level
Charge it with 'all is well'

508
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:03,510

Buzzword is 'all is well'

loosen up to set it right

510
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:11,630
lf you live a bat's life, upside down
earth is hanging garden of Babylon

511
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:15,078
Thread in the doughnut of lentil
Tagline is 'all is well'

512
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,070
Bring that thread
to fly a kite overhead

513
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,957
lf on 31st there's cigarette shortage
'all is well' should be your adage

514

515
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:30,640
Thread in the doughnut of lentil
Tagline is 'all is well'

516
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,351
Bring that thread
to fly a kite overhead

517
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,479
lf on 31st there's cigarette shortage

518
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,231
Beedi will do
to bond us true

519
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:11,708
Paneer, my son
How could you

520
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,552
leave me and go?
You got away with it

521
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:34,195
Police didn't find out

522
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,637
Paneer Selvam's dad is also in the dark

523
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,599
Do you know what the cause of death is,
according to the post mortem report?

524
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,519
Pressure on windpipe
resulting in choking

525
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,471
They claim he died
due to pressure here

526
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,318
But he had pressure
here for 4 years

527
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,035
ls anyone aware of that?

528
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,399
Why was that not recorded?

529
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,237
Engineers find machines
for various needs

530
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:07,190
lf there was a machine to measure
this pressure, by now everyone will know

531
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,315
...this is not suicide

532
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:10,831
...but murder!

533
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:15,913
How dare you blame me
for Paneer Selvam's suicide?

534
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:20,952
How are we responsible, if a student
cannot handle academic pressure?

535
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,759
There are gazillion pressures in life

536
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,878
How can you blame
someone else for it?

537
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,111
l am not blaming you, sir

538
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,319
l am pointing a finger
at our system

539
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,992
l have statistics
to prove my point

540
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,878
lndia leads as # 01 country

541
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,632
in students committing suicide
For every 90 minutes a student

542
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,871
tries to commits suicide

543
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:50,553
More than ill-health or accident
death rate by suicide is higher

544
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,313
l am not bothered
about all your statistics

545
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:55,236
This is 1 of the finest
colleges in our country

546
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:58,157
lt is 32 years
since this college was started

547
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:02,472
From 28th rank
l've brought it to #1 rank

548
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,639
What are your standing in #1?

549
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:07,999
We refer to peeing also
as 'number 1 '

550
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,717
No one is allowed
to think out of the box

551
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,318
There's no respect
for innovative inventions

552
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:22,636
Their target is marks oriented,
cushy job or settle abroad only

553
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:28,435
You teach how to achieve good grades
Not how to excel as an engineer!

554
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:33,956
Then you teach me
- No, sir, l didn't mea...

555
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,637
Today we are going to see the thermal

556
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,151
Dr K.S, please take a seat

557
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:53,470
Students, he is soooper
intellectual and a genius

558
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:58,029
He knows more than
all the qualified teachers here

559
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:05,074
Today, Professor Dr Engineer Parivendhan
will teach us a lesson in engineering

560
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,679
- Sir, how can l...

561
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:08,796
- To you, now!

562
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,237
We do not have all day

563
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:39,509
Bi sent-hilator

564
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,957
Driven- katri- nation

565
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:55,196
l'll give you all 30 seconds time
Find out what these words mean

566
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,551
You can refer your books

567
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:01,196
Those who find the answer
please raise your hands

568
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:06,118
Let me see who is 1st
and who is last

569
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:10,199
Your time starts now

570
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:39,757
Time up

571
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:44,592
Time up, sir

572
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:52,313
None of you could
find the answer?

573
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:58,519
For 1 minute
rewind your lives

574
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:05,990
As soon as l wrote these 2 words
did any of you have feel electrified?

575
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:11,916
Did you feel an excitement
to learn something new?

576
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:13,718
Anyone?

577
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:17,876
No

578
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:22,909
As soon as l said start
all of you ran a race

579
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,915
What do you gain by falling all over
your books and getting A grades?

580
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,434
Are you increasing
your knowledge?

581
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:33,237
No, only your
pressure increases

582
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,750
This is a college
Not a pressure cooker!

583
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:43,552
Even in a circus, the lion, petrified
of the ring master's whip

584
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:44,716
...obeys his commands

585
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:49,275
Do we call it a well trained lion
...or well educated?!

586
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:52,314
Hello!
This is not a philosophy class

587
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,432
Explain what those 2 words mean

588
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,519
Sir, those words
don't exist

589
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:05,553
They are just names of my friends
Smoke screen!

590
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:15,398
Quiet

591
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,030
Nonsense, ls this the way
to teach engineering?

592
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,150
No, sir, l'm not here
to teach engineering

593
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:25,553
You are better equipped than me

594
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:28,633
l'm only teaching you
the right way to teach!

595
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:35,913
l have faith
you'll one day learn this

596
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:38,828
Bye, sir
All the best, sir

597
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:46,558
Quiet, l said

598
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:49,396
Your sons Senthil and Venkat

599
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:51,039
due to bad influence are deteriorating

600
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:52,475
... in their studies to dismal depths

601
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:55,598
Letter from Virus was
a bombshell in both our homes

602
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:59,113
Like Nagasaki and Hiroshima
our folks were devastated

603
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:02,315
My friends were invited home
to celebrate my birthday

604
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:09,396
Come in...do you see that
expensive air conditioner?

605
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:11,919
For my son to study
in the lap of luxury

606
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:13,832
l spent Rs15,000
to fit this, only in his room

607
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:16,396
l haven't got myself

608
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:17,871
l still travel in a scooter

609
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:22,953
All my 25 years of earning
l've spent on his education

610
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:27,078
For his future
l've sacrificed our happiness

611
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:33,559
His mother cooks the best raw rice for him
She makes eggs specially for him

612
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:36,793
Hey Venkat!
Are these snaps clicked by you?

613
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:39,512
Photography is his passion

614
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:41,468
He won't even spare a dog
or pig wandering on the road

615
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:43,314
He wants to become
a wild life photographer

616
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:47,796
- What's his % ?
- 91

617
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:50,998
He has slid down
from 94 to 91

618
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:55,675
ls my speech
so funny to you?

619
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:57,156
No, uncle

620
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:59,473
Snaps he has taken are so beautiful

621
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:01,229
Why do you want him
to be an engineer?

622
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:03,033
Let him be a famous
wild life photographer

623
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:07,355
Dear man, l beg you with folded hands

624
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:10,436
Don't confuse my son
and spoil his life

625
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:13,272
Venkat, lunch is ready

626
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:14,436
Pari, come

627
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,194
When you come next time

628
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:24,118
...if you come
before you leave

629
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:30,952
We had prepared our taste bud
for a home cooked gourmet meal

630
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:32,514
But my dad ruined our appetite

631
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:35,430
So we didn't even mind eating
paper at Senthil's house

632
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:40,553
His house seemed like a scene
from an old black and white film

633
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:43,072
...single room with a half dead father

634
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:47,192
...his mother Nirmala
with a whooping cough

635
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:49,512
...and an older sister
Jaya yet to be married

636
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:54,709
His mother was a school teacher,
retired, who lamented non-stop

637
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:57,550
lf a neighbor flashed a smile
she'd immediately ask a favor!

638
00:44:58,360 --> 00:44:59,156
His father was a post master

639
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:02,075
When he was paralyzed on 1 side
they were in deep debt all sides!

640
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:05,068
Whole family was tottering
on this couple's pension

641
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:07,515
Jaya is 28 now

642
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:10,351
Even the theatre usher wants
100 sovereign gold as dowry!

643
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:12,591
lf you don't study well,
how will she get married?

644
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:16,473
One kilo rice is ElGHT rupees!

645
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:18,639
Since wheat is only Rs 3
at the Govt. ration shop

646
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:19,876
...we can afford
to eat only rotis

647
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:22,390
Mother!!!

648
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:24,033
Shall l serve you tomato chutney?

649
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:29,271
Tomato is Rs 8 a kilo
Onion Rs 15 a kilo

650
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:30,432
MOTHER!

651
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,875
lf we get a complaint letter from
your college, how will we survive?

652
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:39,080
Looks like we need to go
to a jewelry shop to buy onions!

653
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:40,595
some more
tomato chutney?

654
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:43,674
No, thanks

655
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:46,077
Why are you disgracing me
in front of my friends like this?

656
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:48,636
Okay, l'll stick
glue on my lips

657
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:54,716
l've got to earn making
my throat go hoarse, for you

658
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:56,679
l should double up as maid
at home and do all the chores

659
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,479
...but not open my mouth!

660
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:01,279
l can pour my heart out
only to my son

661
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:03,278
Can l tell our difficulties
to your friends?

662
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:13,157
We were in a dilemma, whether
to console Senthil or his mother

663
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:16,439
We decided to 1st comfort
our stomach's hunger pangs

664
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:29,548
To relieve his constant itching
1 tube of Saibol ointment is Rs15

665
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:36,434
Do you want another roti?

666
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:42,560
This is enough,
thank you

667
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:49,072
Tomato is Rs 8 a kilo
Onion Rs 15 a kilo!

668
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:54,237
At least my mother gave us roti

669
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:55,395
His father shooed us away

670
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:57,392
Real sadist
Hitler

671
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,276
Yeah! Your mother is Mother Teresa
She gave us 'chest haired roti'!

672
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:04,069
lf you talk ill of my mother
l'll make mince meat of you

673
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:07,239
Why are you both fighting?
l'm dying of hunger

674
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:08,350
Let's go eat somewhere

675
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:10,357
Who'll pay?
Mother Teresa?!

676
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:15,549
You don't need cash
Just a cover will do!

677
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:17,836
Look over there

678
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:24,198
Good evening
-Welcome

679
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:25,396
How are your parents?

680
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:27,189
Can't you see them?
They are right behind me

681
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:27,992
Do you know them?

682
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:32,595
l'm so terrified

683
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:34,313
Even before we eat, l think,
l need to use the restroom

684
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:40,638
We must taste every single item
on the buffet menu, buddy

685
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:42,035
You'll burst and die

686
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:44,949
All we need to do is
download at intervals!

687
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:50,553
Ria...what the hell is this?

688
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:52,474
Why are you wearing
such an ancient watch?

689
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:53,909
What will people think of you?

690
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:56,229
You have a status to maintain
as Rakesh's fiancee

691
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:57,716
You'll become a famous doctor

692
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:00,874
People will mock at your watch
Throw that Rs 200 watch away

693
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:06,516
- Hi Handsome!
-Hi aunty!

694
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:08,555
Did you notice something?

695
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:09,512
Rubies?

696
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:11,229
Bought in Mandalay

697
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:15,515
Let's go meet David

698
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:21,950
Excuse me

699
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:23,872
Yes

700
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:25,589
Flowers

701
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:29,157
Please give me that glass

702
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:30,272
Why?

703
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:32,559
ln case you hit
my head with it

704
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:33,870
Why would l do that?

705
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:38,389
l want to give you some
free 'pearls of wisdom'

706
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:38,918
What?

707
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:41,992
Don't marry thatjackass!

708
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:44,037
Excuse me

709
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:45,189
He's not human(e)
Mr Price tag!

710
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:46,637
Listen

711
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:48,350
lf you marry him

712
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:50,671
...you'll be showered
with brands and their price lists

713
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:51,676
...but no life

714
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:52,238
Hello

715
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:53,550
Shall l show you a demo?

716
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:57,913
Would you like to know
how expensive his shoes are?

717
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:01,112
l won't ask
He'll himself volunteer

718
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:01,997
Just watch

719
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:06,556
Life is a brand
Even God is a brand

720
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:07,596
That's why l have brandy

721
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:09,318
Without a brand you are nothing

722
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:14,755
Oh! Shucks
- You fool!

723
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:18,715
He poured chutney
on my $300 shoes

724
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:22,998
My $300 shoes
My God!

725
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:23,877
How will l walk now?

726
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:24,872
Didn't l tell you?

727
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:26,629
Escaaaape!
Free advice!!

728
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:28,148
lt's your call

729
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:35,915
Dad, are they your guests?

730
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:38,397
Serve for me also

731
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:42,080
They are my students
Why are they here?

732
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:44,396
1 second

733
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,673
Hi ! You opened
my eyes to reality

734
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:49,751
Thank you so much

735
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:54,160
lt's no big deal
Social service is my hobby

736
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:57,592
Why don't you do 1 more
good deed for the day?

737
00:49:58,120 --> 00:49:59,348
Sure, Tell me

738
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:02,754
My dad is so stubborn
l should marry only Rakesh

739
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:05,918
You have a way with words

740
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:08,038
Can you show my dad also a demo?

741
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:10,075
Don't you worry

742
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:12,550
l'll make him tell
how much his briefs cost!

743
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:14,354
Senthil, pass that chutney

744
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:15,830
You are so sweet

745
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:21,079
- Where is your father?
- Right behind you.

746
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:30,591
All is well

747
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:35,877
Escape, Free advice

748
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:38,077
lt's your call!

749
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:41,311
What are you doing here?

750
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:47,317
We wanted to give our gift
to the bride and groom

751
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:49,830
You can hand it over to me
Bride happens to be my sister

752
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:54,792
l think l need to use the restroom!!!

753
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:02,079
Sir, how many
daughters do you have?

754
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:04,192
Empty

755
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:06,272
lt's not a gift cover
lt's a freebie cover!

756
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,069
We had kept a 1000 rupee note inside

757
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:10,351
Where did it disappear?

758
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:14,470
We never invited you
Maybe the groom did?

759
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:19,075
Actually...we belong
to science side

760
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:21,476
Explain that to me

761
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:24,110
Dad, he has a way with words

762
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:26,916
Give my dad your demo
Please

763
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:31,635
Sir, you know in Chennai,
very often, there's power failure

764
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:34,994
So many weddings are hassled

765
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:40,988
We want to invent an inverter
using battery of the cars parked here

766
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:44,677
- Wow!

767
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:46,190
lnvented inverter?

768
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:50,276
Design is ready, sir

769
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:56,676
Where's the design l gave you?

770
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:00,792
l gave it to Senthil ages ago

771
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:03,679
Senthil, design?

772
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:12,875
Sir, ask all your guests
to give me their car keys

773
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:14,991
l'll make an inverter
here, right now

774
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:18,160
You can invent stories
Not an inverter

775
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:20,990
Sir, trust me
l can

776
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:25,114
Since we invented it
at your daughter's wedding

777
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:28,234
...as an ode to you, we want to
name it as 'Virus inverter'

778
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:29,390
How does it sound?

779
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:32,473
Daaad! Your nick name is 'Virus'?
You never told us

780
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,230
Senthil and Venkat, be at my office
tomorrow during lunch break

781
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:46,878
Sorry sir, we'll pay you
back for the dinner

782
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:49,390
...in installments

783
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:51,759
We won't attend any wedding

784
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:53,554
Not even mine, sir!

785
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:55,354
l won't even get married, sir!!

786
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:57,558
Your parents shouldn't have got married!!!

787
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:00,393
World would be less by 2 idiots

788
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:06,389
ls he starting off
on a lecture spree?

789
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:07,112
Pay attention

790
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:14,275
Back to zeros and eggs?!

791
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:18,236
Monthly income of your friend
Panchavan Parivendhan's father

792
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:28,714
lf we remove 3 ciphers from that
it's Venkat's father's monthly salary

793
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:32,639
Remove 1 more zero

794
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:36,636
Rs 2500 is your entire family's
TOTAL monthly income, Senthil

795
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:42,555
l don't have to explain
your situation better than this

796
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:46,231
lf you want to study diligently
and pass with flying colors

797
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:50,112
...move to Srivatsan's room

798
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:55,032
lf you join with Pari
you'll end up in a garbage can

799
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:14,870
Dear boys

800
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:16,955
Do you want to shave?

801
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:18,594
No, sir

802
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:19,996
Then get lost

803
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:25,156
This is called 'divide and rule'!
Virus is trying to spoil our friendship

804
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:26,476
Don't be worried

805
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:28,912
We have to worry
He's the 'grade-giver'

806
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:31,313
lf we don't get good grades
we won't get a decentjob

807
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:36,230
l don't have a rich dad
to be cool about my future

808
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:37,949
Why are you lamenting like this?

809
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:40,038
Then do we have to
follow whatever he says?

810
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:41,396
All is well
All is well

811
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:43,273
You can play 2nd fiddle to him
l can't do that

812
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:45,119
Oi! You are crossing your limit

813
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:47,155
No, l'm saying
'let's be within our limits'

814
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:49,309
My family is depending on me

815
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:53,119
My mother's entire pension money
gets spent on my father's medicine

816
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:57,317
lf we don't give 50 sovereigns of gold
looks like my sister won't get married

817
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:03,195
lt's more than 5 years since
my mother wore a good sari

818
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:06,434
Mother Teresa wore
only a white sari all her life!

819
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:08,919
ls my family's suffering
entertainment for you?

820
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:13,118
We have to study to pass

821
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:16,349
But not to get great grades
or an awesome job

822
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:18,309
We should study to
enhance our knowledge

823
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:20,388
Don't go behind success

824
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,513
Choose a career you like

825
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:24,075
Follow your heart. Hone your skills

826
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:27,472
Work hard
Success will automatically follow

827
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:28,516
Many wise men have said this

828
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:31,311
Which wise man?
Pari-anandha the God-man?

829
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:33,676
Your pearls of wisdom, huh?

830
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:40,479
Senthil, don't get tensed
We'll all definitely pass

831
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:41,670
Nothing is impossible

832
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:44,355
Nothing is impossible?

833
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:50,274
Try to squeeze this
back into the tube

834
00:55:56,920 --> 00:56:00,390
Like how lndia got freed from the British
and got trapped with our politicians

835
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:04,037
Senthil, thinking he escaped from us
got into the clutches of Srivatsan

836
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:06,673
Our nickname for
Srivatsan is silencer

837
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:09,114
To magnify his memory

838
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:11,278
he gorged on...
...'lncrease l.Q Jelly'

839
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:15,589
God knows what crap that was!
Offensive smell of his flatulence

840
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:16,671
was beyond our nasal tolerance!

841
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:26,589
l didn't do it
Senthil, wasn't it you?

842
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:27,797
''Caution''
''Fart-king''

843
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:30,190
Silencer memorizes
non stop...18 hours a day

844
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:33,758
Day before the exam he'll ensure
...that others don't supersede

845
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:35,235
his grades by distracting them

846
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:39,235
He believed in 2 ways
of being the topper

847
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:40,959
1st make sure
he gets good grades

848
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:43,391
2 nd to ensure others
DON'T get good grades

849
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:48,198
To put an end to
Silencer's sly tricks

850
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:49,556
...and to save Senthil

851
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:51,314
...Pari came up with
a genius game plan

852
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:55,714
Our college principal
is an expert at teaching

853
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:58,072
Do you know the meaning
of all these Tamil words?

854
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:02,679
l don't need to know
l am a good memorizer

855
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:03,118
Go ahead

856
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:06,233
Srivatsan was selected to give
welcome speech on teachers' day

857
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:09,115
To impress Virus he asked Bose
to write a speech for him

858
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:10,998
...in chaste Tamil

859
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,558
Srivatsan
There's a call for you

860
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:25,074
Mr Bose, take a print out

861
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:25,837
l'll be right back

862
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:29,355
Why is there a sudden stink
of rotten cabbage here?!

863
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:34,276
Princi was just talking about you

864
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:36,517
ls that so?
l'll go see him then

865
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:37,710
Give this to Srivatsan

866
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:44,794
l'm calling from
the commissioner's office

867
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:48,910
- Are you Srivatsan from California?

868
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:50,229
- Yes sir, you are right

869
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:51,669
We've got classified information
...that you are part of a revolutionary

870
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:53,712
youth movement and you have secretly

871
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:58,551
...stored bombs in your hostel room

872
00:57:59,080 --> 00:57:59,910
Bomb?

873
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:03,909
That too a silent bomb

874
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:06,677
Don't be drama king!

875
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:09,914
lf we take you to station
and tap you in the right places

876
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:13,232
...every inch of truth will
automatically come out

877
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:15,119
No sir, it will pain, sir

878
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:17,628
Silencer's attention was
diverted to give Pari time

879
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:19,832
...to change certain words
in his speech strategically!

880
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:23,591
For example, karpikkum (to teach)
was changed to karpazhikkum (to rape)

881
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:26,233
Excuse me, sir
Did you call me?

882
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:27,357
Who are you?

883
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:34,035
Librarian Bose
Permanent staff, sir

884
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:36,630
Congratulations

885
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:44,952
One minute Commissioner wants
to talk to you

886
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:46,191
Sir...sir...sir

887
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:47,077
Silencer!

888
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:53,118
They say you are
yourself a human bomb!

889
00:58:54,920 --> 00:58:56,035
We've got reports
from intelligence

890
00:58:56,560 --> 00:58:59,836
Sir, wrong information
You can search my room, sir

891
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:01,229
Shut up...you

892
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:03,879
l know it's not in your room

893
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:07,155
l also know you've hidden it
somewhere behind you!

894
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:10,597
Apparently you are an expert
in releasing bombs

895
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:11,477
...invisible to the human eye!

896
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:16,398
lt's because of people like you that
there's a huge hole in the ozone layer!

897
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:20,191
This is a very important case in the city

898
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:22,839
lt's now changed hands to CBl

899
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:24,595
We'll be there anytime

900
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:28,553
Till then you should not leave
your college hostel premises

901
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:30,359
You are mistaking me for...

902
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:31,431
Hands up!

903
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:49,392
Hey! Silencer

904
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:50,915
Mr Bose asked me
to give this to you

905
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:51,632
You don't call me that

906
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:52,949
You Pari poori
scumbag of a crap cleaner!

907
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:55,469
lrritating fellows
Always sitting on the steps

908
00:59:58,200 --> 00:59:59,758
Principal never called me

909
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:03,031
l only said he was talking about you
Did l say he called you?!

910
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:07,192
Get lost!!

911
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:19,111
Warm welcome to Respected minister,

912
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:25,113
my dear teachers and my student buddies

913
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:32,635
Last week in the survey made by lndia Today
our college has the honor of been ranked

914
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:37,869
7th place in lndia
and 1st in Tamil Nadu

915
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:41,553
All credit goes to only 1 individual

916
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:45,590
Our college principal
Mr Virumandi Sandhanam

917
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:53,835
Voice is his, Words are mine!

918
01:00:57,720 --> 01:01:00,359
For the past 32 years
full credit goes to him, solely

919
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:06,676
...for many boys and girls in our college
to have been raped by him!

920
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:16,598
l was the one who substituted
rape for teach

921
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:21,792
Many have been raped by him

922
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:25,510
l am surprised how one single man

923
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,958
in his lifetime can rape
so many students

924
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:36,196
He has prepared himself thoroughly
for this from his adolescent years

925
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:38,471
...by reading appropriate books
and indulging in apt exercises

926
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:42,077
...thereby becoming
strong enough to do a good job!

927
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:48,470
We should all follow his footsteps

928
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:55,198
We as students here, today
...whichever corner of the world

929
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:56,594
we may be in, tomorrow

930
01:01:57,320 --> 01:02:00,198
...must take an oath
to rape just like him

931
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:11,952
We should prove that no one else
but an lEC student can rape so effectively!

932
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:16,796
Srivatsan!

933
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:23,430
The credit for that act will go only to
king of rape, our principal Mr Virumandi

934
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:28,908
Avatar of generosity in rape
Mr Virumandi sandhanam

935
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:40,872
Next, our respected kalavi minister

936
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:46,835
Kalavi means sex, right?

937
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,672
Sex is his existence

938
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:54,952
Kalvi (education)
became kalavi (sex)!!!

939
01:02:55,360 --> 01:02:58,511
For the sake of sex
he has awesome kongai

940
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:04,712
KoLgai (principle)
became kongai(breast)!!

941
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:07,196
Kongai means breast, nitwit!

942
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:09,551
Virumandi, why is he
talking total crap?

943
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:15,636
Minister for sex, our rape king
is scrutinizing your breasts intensely

944
01:03:21,720 --> 01:03:24,280
He is your designated
breast propaganda delegate!

945
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:28,474
How demeaning this is!

946
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:30,551
lt will soon be
talk of the town

947
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:34,150
...without doubt that he will
molest your breasts

948
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:38,595
Did you invite me here
to humiliate me like this?

949
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:40,638
Sir...sir

950
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:46,999
Today is teachers' day

951
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:51,229
Teacher's vocation is dedication
Sacrifice yourself to this service

952
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:55,120
This is the right moment to reward
...our teachers who have

953
01:03:55,120 --> 01:03:57,759
dedicated their lives to us
with kusuvaasam

954
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:58,398
Lord Shiva. help me!

955
01:04:00,760 --> 01:04:01,476
Art o' fart!

956
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:02,676
Our fart-king is rocking, man!

957
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:05,558
Vishwasam (gratitude)
became kusuvaasam (art o' fart)

958
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:07,433
How do we display
our art o' fart?

959
01:04:08,120 --> 01:04:09,314
Listen to our expert

960
01:04:09,840 --> 01:04:11,876
Art o' fart! is of 4 kinds

961
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:13,719
Do we need to
listen to this crap?

962
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:17,152
B.B.N.T
Big Bang No Tension

963
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:21,677
L.S.S.D
Little Spicy Slightly Disturbing

964
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:26,998
M.S.V.E
More Spicy Very Embarrassing

965
01:04:29,120 --> 01:04:31,156
S.B.D
Silent But Deadly

966
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:41,876
Thank you very much

967
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:45,676
What wrong did l do, sir?

968
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:46,796
l spoke high of you only

969
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:48,870
Don't kick me, sir

970
01:04:49,080 --> 01:04:50,559
Get out, you moron!

971
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:54,672
This is what happens,
if you learn by rote!

972
01:04:57,040 --> 01:04:58,268
What you memorize now
...may hold you

973
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:01,119
in good stead for 4 years
But the next 40 years

974
01:05:01,360 --> 01:05:02,475
it will rape you!

975
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:12,628
Fart-king really rocks

976
01:05:14,360 --> 01:05:15,156
You swines!

977
01:05:15,720 --> 01:05:16,516
Why did you do this to me?

978
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:18,829
How did l ever harm you?

979
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:21,676
Sorry Vatsan
Don't take anything personal

980
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:27,350
l won't forget this disgrace
till my dying day

981
01:05:28,520 --> 01:05:32,195
l'll think of it every minute
every second of my lifetime

982
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:34,871
Let it go
Don't get too hyper

983
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:37,670
We showed a demo to Senthil
Repercussions of mugging

984
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:39,269
Whatever is learnt
should be understood

985
01:05:39,960 --> 01:05:40,995
We should revel
in enjoying science

986
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:43,237
l have not come here
to enjoy reading science

987
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:45,275
Did you come to rape science?

988
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:47,876
silent but deadly

989
01:05:49,720 --> 01:05:50,391
Laugh to your heart's content

990
01:05:51,160 --> 01:05:53,276
Make fun of my learning methods

991
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:57,556
One day with these same methods
l'll be a successful celebrity

992
01:05:58,440 --> 01:06:01,318
l'll have the last laugh then!
You will be crying

993
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:03,239
You are in the wrong track, Vatsan

994
01:06:03,720 --> 01:06:05,278
l am on the right track

995
01:06:07,360 --> 01:06:09,112
You are on a different train,
l am on a different train

996
01:06:09,640 --> 01:06:11,870
Let's see who becomes successful 1st

997
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:17,315
Same day 10 years later
we'll all be back to the same station

998
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:20,235
Then we'll know who made it big

999
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:22,716
Want to bet on that?

1000
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:26,115
Let's see who wins
Come on

1001
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:29,079
l challenge you

1002
01:06:29,800 --> 01:06:30,949
lf you pride yourself
in being a man, say yes

1003
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:36,669
What is he doing?

1004
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:45,959
Don't forget this day

1005
01:06:50,560 --> 01:06:51,117
wowww!

1006
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:52,794
A brand is a brand always

1007
01:06:53,080 --> 01:06:56,231
This is a 1st time l've got
such an expensive gift, Rakesh

1008
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:57,549
You will be Rakesh's wife

1009
01:06:58,160 --> 01:06:59,434
Hereafter you have to be 'branded'!

1010
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:03,596
l'll be right back

1011
01:07:08,840 --> 01:07:10,068
Weren't you the one
who changed the subject?

1012
01:07:11,320 --> 01:07:12,070
Watch is soooper!

1013
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:13,152
Don't change the subject

1014
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:13,872
l didn't

1015
01:07:14,120 --> 01:07:14,711
You are change your watch

1016
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:15,836
l'm not talking of
our present conversation

1017
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:19,997
Kind of...

1018
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:21,468
What's your grouse
against my dad?

1019
01:07:22,120 --> 01:07:24,839
Nothing, l've even named
my inverter after him!

1020
01:07:25,320 --> 01:07:25,911
Take a look

1021
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:31,468
Why are you stressing out my dad?

1022
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:34,754
Your dad is not running a college
but a factory

1023
01:07:35,120 --> 01:07:36,394
Factory that churns out donkeys

1024
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:38,672
Like your donkey
standing over there

1025
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:43,551
You?!

1026
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:47,191
What audacity to call
my fiance a donkey?!

1027
01:07:47,560 --> 01:07:50,472
Because he is one
1st he studied engineering, then MBA

1028
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:51,869
Now he's working in a bank in USA

1029
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:54,832
Why study engineering
to work in a bank?

1030
01:07:55,840 --> 01:07:56,750
Your dad got taken in

1031
01:07:57,080 --> 01:07:59,548
...or he's from a money lending family
Just 'cos he's a topper and

1032
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:02,957
got you stuck with him for life

1033
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:06,717
To all these donkeys
life is just profit or loss

1034
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:08,918
As far as he is concerned
you are an asset to him

1035
01:08:10,200 --> 01:08:12,316
You are Prinicpal's daughter
You can afford to give a fat dowry

1036
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:14,313
You'll become a doctor
Your pocket will be well lined

1037
01:08:14,560 --> 01:08:15,913
You'll enhance his image

1038
01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:17,674
That's why he's making a bee line for you!

1039
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,319
He thinks of you as a brand

1040
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:21,238
...not as a woman

1041
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:23,068
What the hell do you think of yourself?

1042
01:08:23,440 --> 01:08:24,714
Are you saying
Rakesh doesn't love me?

1043
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:26,311
He bought this watch, right?

1044
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:27,677
Hold this for a moment

1045
01:08:28,280 --> 01:08:29,554
Only demos make you understand

1046
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:30,796
Just wait and watch!!

1047
01:08:31,960 --> 01:08:32,710
Hey! Rakesh!

1048
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:37,114
Where did you disappear Ria?
l was worried

1049
01:08:37,840 --> 01:08:41,037
Ria lost her new watch
That's what she's hunting for

1050
01:08:41,240 --> 01:08:42,639
Whaaaaat?
You lost that watch?

1051
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:43,956
No worries, Rakesh

1052
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:44,796
We can always
buy her another watch

1053
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:45,989
-Nonsense
-Thank you

1054
01:08:46,320 --> 01:08:46,672
Riiaaaaa

1055
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:48,599
lt's 4 lakhs, Ria

1056
01:08:48,840 --> 01:08:49,556
4 lakhs?!

1057
01:08:51,680 --> 01:08:53,591
My watch is just Rs 400
Both show the same time

1058
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:54,596
-Said up
- Okay, forget it

1059
01:08:55,080 --> 01:08:56,559
You are so careless, Ria

1060
01:08:56,880 --> 01:08:59,269
This careless attitude
is just disgusting

1061
01:08:59,760 --> 01:09:01,910
That was a limited edition watch
You just lost it

1062
01:09:02,240 --> 01:09:03,468
'cos you got it free

1063
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:06,231
Fine, wear your obsolete
oldie watch for dinner parties

1064
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:07,836
Why are you staring

1065
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:11,589
ls this how mature
you can be?!

1066
01:09:12,120 --> 01:09:13,473
l can't handle this

1067
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:15,471
Stop crying and
search for the watch

1068
01:09:16,360 --> 01:09:16,792
Damn it

1069
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:18,792
She doesn't care
if its a branded watch, man

1070
01:09:19,040 --> 01:09:19,916
She just doesn't get it

1071
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:26,552
What?

1072
01:09:27,240 --> 01:09:30,437
Your 4 lakh watch
Find some other hand for it

1073
01:09:30,760 --> 01:09:31,237
Donkey!

1074
01:09:38,720 --> 01:09:40,358
You are a very bold lady

1075
01:09:41,160 --> 01:09:42,718
You called him a donkey
straight to his face

1076
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:44,037
Get lost

1077
01:09:45,320 --> 01:09:49,359
l thought you'll thank me for saving you
instead you are cursing me!

1078
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:50,516
Okay, thank you

1079
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:51,637
Move aside

1080
01:09:57,200 --> 01:09:58,315
You don't love him at all

1081
01:09:59,040 --> 01:09:59,631
What do you mean?

1082
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:03,715
lf you truly loved him
if he stood before you...

1083
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:06,839
La la la laaaa....

1084
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:08,915
You'll hear music in your ears

1085
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:11,316
Butterflies will flutter in your heart

1086
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:16,356
Every inch of you
will bloom and blossom

1087
01:10:20,440 --> 01:10:22,351
Stars will appear
like a silver moon

1088
01:10:26,720 --> 01:10:27,948
All this will happen
in computer graphics

1089
01:10:28,200 --> 01:10:30,760
...in director Shankar's reel life,
not in our real life!

1090
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:35,911
lt will happen if you fall in love
with a man and not a donkey

1091
01:10:41,720 --> 01:10:42,357
Hello

1092
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:46,477
What?

1093
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:49,396
Oh God!

1094
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,116
Okay, l'll be there right now

1095
01:10:56,600 --> 01:10:59,956
Aren't you a medical student?
l need a favor

1096
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:00,871
Emergency please

1097
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:01,473
What?

1098
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:03,638
A patient is dying
Come with me

1099
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:04,272
Stupit

1100
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:11,515
What's the use of taking a Hippocratic oath
that you'll save a life without fear or favor?

1101
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:13,599
You'll anyways kill patients
once you are a doctor!

1102
01:11:14,840 --> 01:11:15,431
Come with me, please

1103
01:11:18,760 --> 01:11:20,478
You created a ruckus
in my sister's wedding

1104
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:22,552
You broke my engagement

1105
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:25,633
My dad is swallowing tablets
for blood pressure like peanuts

1106
01:11:26,720 --> 01:11:27,948
And here l am helping you!

1107
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:29,117
Unbelievable!!

1108
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:33,879
- Aunty, where is Senthil?

1109
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:35,076
- He is gone to get a taxi

1110
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:37,920
2 hours since he called
for an ambulance

1111
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:40,113
Even a pizza gets
delivered within 1/2 hour!

1112
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:41,435
What kind of a city this is!

1113
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:43,868
We must immediately
admit him in hospital

1114
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:56,359
Hey hey!. Hey stop!

1115
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:02,996
Move...move...move

1116
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:12,632
Emergency

1117
01:12:19,720 --> 01:12:21,790
Do you have any brains?
You brought my dad in a scooter

1118
01:12:23,400 --> 01:12:24,515
l couldn't get a flight
That's why

1119
01:12:25,080 --> 01:12:26,672
Don't be over smart!
Where's my dad?

1120
01:12:28,520 --> 01:12:29,157
Go and ask the doctor

1121
01:12:30,520 --> 01:12:31,509
lt was a close call, Ria

1122
01:12:32,160 --> 01:12:34,720
We'd have lost him
if you'd been a little late

1123
01:12:35,160 --> 01:12:36,673
Thank God you didn't wait
for the ambulance

1124
01:12:37,080 --> 01:12:39,071
He's alive thanks to
your presence of mind

1125
01:12:40,120 --> 01:12:41,235
Give me a call
incase you need me

1126
01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:51,151
Thank you, Pari

1127
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:54,594
How can you
thank your friend?!

1128
01:12:56,960 --> 01:12:58,916
Tomorrow is your exam
Leave now

1129
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:03,190
There are many exams in life
But only 1 dad!

1130
01:13:07,360 --> 01:13:09,157
Only when post master
is home safe and sound

1131
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:11,112
...we'll leave, don't worry

1132
01:13:20,920 --> 01:13:21,670
Forgive me, Pari

1133
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:26,109
l was terrified

1134
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:29,870
All is well

1135
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:35,958
Go in and see your father

1136
01:13:46,280 --> 01:13:48,748
This is a soooper dooooper scooter
lt has saved a life

1137
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:50,511
How much do you think it'll cost?!

1138
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:53,076
Pour chutney on it, l'll tell you!!

1139
01:13:59,040 --> 01:13:59,836
Happy lndependence day

1140
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:02,349
Today isn't August 15th

1141
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:03,915
For you it is August 15th!!

1142
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:06,478
You can wear your mom's watch
with absolute freedom

1143
01:14:07,240 --> 01:14:09,151
No donkey can question you!

1144
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:11,677
Can't ridicule it
as obsolete oldie watch

1145
01:14:12,120 --> 01:14:13,519
Take care, bye

1146
01:14:16,760 --> 01:14:18,716
How did you find out
that its my mom's watch?

1147
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:21,716
At your sister's wedding you were

1148
01:14:22,360 --> 01:14:25,432
dressed to kill from head to toe...
...watch alone wasn't trendy

1149
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:27,196
l just guessed

1150
01:14:29,640 --> 01:14:32,712
You must have missed
your mom a lot that day, right?

1151
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:37,037
Yes

1152
01:14:37,800 --> 01:14:39,028
She must have been a very beautiful lady

1153
01:14:39,680 --> 01:14:40,954
Ya, how do you know that?

1154
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:42,876
l've seen your dad!!!

1155
01:14:44,360 --> 01:14:48,558
Remember life is a race
Run...run...run fast

1156
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:50,758
...or those behind you
will trample you

1157
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:42,509

Unconditional love

1161
01:15:57,560 --> 01:16:01,348
l plucked a word out of
every language in an array

1162
01:16:02,240 --> 01:16:06,028
l braided them together
to make a love bouquet

1163
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:10,395
l offer it to you as my gift
with love as my wish list

1164
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:18,917
Know not how love struck a chord
with you of its own accord

1165
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:29,276
My life that was meandering
'coz of you found a meaning

1166
01:16:30,040 --> 01:16:33,749

Diameter & depth
on your bosom l'll analyze

1173
01:17:37,440 --> 01:17:41,194
Curve lines
on your waist l'll summarize

1174
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:50,675
Are you Plato's son in disguise?

1175
01:17:51,680 --> 01:17:55,389
Am l your lab to research & revise?

1176
01:17:56,400 --> 01:17:59,597
You are unwell and in misery
Your eyes show that clearly

1177
01:18:00,760 --> 01:18:04,309
To cure you of that malady
l prescribe my kiss as remedy

1178
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:06,953
With my stethoscope

Unconditional love

1184
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:09,598
You came in my dream like dejavu
King, you taunted me, why did you?

1185
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:14,117
You insisted l pay taxes as duty
while your heat waves 'hit' on me

1186
01:19:15,240 --> 01:19:18,676
With your blood on heat
you came near me for a treat

1187
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:23,753
Shall l fulfill your need
follow the cool moon's lead?

1188
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:28,316
Glass-moon, my eyes
you bedazzled bright

1189
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:32,956
On earth you cast
your shadow white

1190
01:19:33,960 --> 01:19:37,316
On a blade of grass you are the dew
crystal clear with a heart so true

1191
01:19:38,720 --> 01:19:41,951
You are a lap-top virus-free
Your soul shines a halo of purity

1192
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:45,190
My back yard jasmine!
You are so enchanting

1193

What happened?
Post master passed away, huh?

1205

...we'll all wonder why!

1214

-Steady yourself

Looks like Venus and
Lady Luck are smiling on me!

1217

Grand ma died back home

01:21:41,400 --> 01:21:41,991
Whose grand mother?

01:21:42,320 --> 01:21:43,116
His!!!
His grandma, sir

1225
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:47,959
Nothing to worry, sir
Everything is okay

1226
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:56,916
Sir, they are still writing

1227
01:21:58,640 --> 01:22:00,676
Hello!
Time up

1228
01:22:01,160 --> 01:22:03,879
Give us 5 minutes, sir
We started half hr late

1229
01:22:04,240 --> 01:22:06,390
Grandma died, sir
Please, sir

1230
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:10,872
As if we asked for his daughter's
mobile #, he's glaring daggers at us

1231
01:22:11,960 --> 01:22:14,428
He was busy arranging the papers
according to our respective roll numbers

1232
01:22:14,920 --> 01:22:16,638
ln that gap we finished
writing the exam

1233
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:18,952
- Thank you, sir

1234
01:22:19,080 --> 01:22:20,513
Too late
you can keep it

1235
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:21,789
Sir, sir...please, sir

1236
01:22:22,040 --> 01:22:22,677
Nothing doing

1237
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:25,549
Do you know who we are?

1238
01:22:26,040 --> 01:22:27,871
l don't care if you are
our chief minister's grand son

1239
01:22:28,400 --> 01:22:30,914
Reply only to questions we ask
Do you know our names?

1240
01:22:32,200 --> 01:22:33,349
At least our roll numbers?

1241
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:34,191
l don't know

1242
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:35,117
What will you do?

1243
01:22:36,200 --> 01:22:37,076
lt seems he doesn't
know our roll nubers

1244
01:22:37,320 --> 01:22:38,116
Escaaaaaaaape!

1245
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:42,876
Stop

1246
01:22:46,520 --> 01:22:47,316
Day of result

1247
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:50,277
Everyone was petitioning God

1248
01:22:51,360 --> 01:22:53,874
l've prayed to You, Trinity of Gods
every single day of my college life

1249
01:22:54,760 --> 01:22:57,513
l am not asking for distinction
Just let me scrape through

1250
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:04,397
Oi! Look right at the end

1251
01:23:07,320 --> 01:23:07,957
Your name is right

1252
01:23:08,440 --> 01:23:08,952
- The penultimate.

1253
01:23:10,880 --> 01:23:12,711
-Yours?
-2nd last.

1254
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:15,757
Pari?

1255
01:23:24,280 --> 01:23:24,757
No

1256
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:27,356
We were completely
down in the dumps with our life

1257
01:23:27,800 --> 01:23:29,358
We didn't really mind being last

1258
01:23:30,080 --> 01:23:32,071
We passed because of him
and to think he failed!

1259
01:23:32,320 --> 01:23:33,275
We were upset is an understatement!

1260
01:23:33,720 --> 01:23:35,676
How can it be?
lts just not possible

1261
01:23:36,240 --> 01:23:37,798
You can try re-valuation
-Go away

1262
01:23:41,400 --> 01:23:42,435
Why is he lamenting?

1263
01:23:44,200 --> 01:23:45,155
He got 2nd place

1264
01:23:46,080 --> 01:23:47,433
lsn't this too much?

1265
01:23:50,320 --> 01:23:50,957
Who is 1st then?

1266
01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:54,074
Panchavan Parivendhan!

1267
01:23:56,920 --> 01:23:57,511
Pari?!?

1268
01:24:05,720 --> 01:24:06,914
That's when we understood

1269
01:24:07,640 --> 01:24:09,596
lf our friend flunks,
we'll be down in the dumps

1270
01:24:10,160 --> 01:24:11,309
lf the same friend tops the class

1271
01:24:11,800 --> 01:24:12,835
...our mind's a mass of mess
like cooked noodles!

1272
01:24:13,680 --> 01:24:15,875
2 more people were
put off and resentful

1273
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,639
Panchavan Parivendhan
1st row right next to the director

1274
01:24:21,800 --> 01:24:24,030
Amalanathan
3rd row 3rd seat

1275
01:24:26,080 --> 01:24:28,514
Murali
2nd row 5th seat

1276
01:24:29,200 --> 01:24:30,394
Swaroopa
3rd row

1277
01:24:33,800 --> 01:24:37,076
ls it necessary to be seated
according to the rank?

1278
01:24:37,520 --> 01:24:40,239
Why?
What's your hassle?

1279
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:44,076
Ranking system itself is a hassle
like our caste system

1280
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:46,199
1st rank student
like a superior caste

1281
01:24:46,520 --> 01:24:47,873
Last rank student is low caste

1282
01:24:48,360 --> 01:24:48,997
lt is not nice, sir

1283
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:50,636
Do you have a brighter brainwave?

1284
01:24:51,680 --> 01:24:55,150
1st we should stop publicizing it
on the notice board

1285
01:24:55,600 --> 01:24:59,673
Why tell the whole world about
those who got low marks or failed

1286
01:24:59,960 --> 01:25:01,279
Why create a wedge?
An inferiority complex?

1287
01:25:01,880 --> 01:25:05,077
You consult a doctor
You are diagnosed with aids

1288
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:07,233
Just an example!

1289
01:25:07,760 --> 01:25:08,988
Doctor will tell you alone
in total privacy?

1290
01:25:09,200 --> 01:25:10,235
Or will he pin it up
on a notice board?

1291
01:25:11,640 --> 01:25:12,356
You see...sir

1292
01:25:13,440 --> 01:25:18,116
Basically what you are saying is whisper
each student's result into his ears

1293
01:25:18,640 --> 01:25:21,200
You are 1st
You are 2nd

1294
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:23,718
l am so sorry but you must

1295
01:25:25,680 --> 01:25:27,432
Sir, you are spraying!

1296
01:25:32,520 --> 01:25:37,230
What l'm trying to say is
ranks create discrimination

1297
01:25:39,800 --> 01:25:41,870
Since l am the class topper
l am sitting next to you

1298
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:43,878
My close friends
'cos they are last

1299
01:25:44,120 --> 01:25:45,678
...you've cast them
into some corner

1300
01:25:46,040 --> 01:25:46,870
Don't you feel sad for them

1301
01:25:47,560 --> 01:25:49,232
At least they are in the picture!

1302
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:51,835
lf they keep gallivanting with you...

1303
01:25:52,640 --> 01:25:54,517
...next time they won't
even be in the frame

1304
01:25:56,160 --> 01:25:59,755
They will neither pass
or get a decentjob

1305
01:26:00,440 --> 01:26:01,236
They will get a job, sir

1306
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:05,233
There are many companies that believe
in human brains instead of robots!

1307
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,355
l guarantee that

1308
01:26:10,480 --> 01:26:11,196
You guarantee it?

1309
01:26:13,800 --> 01:26:14,391
Bet, sir?

1310
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:18,279
-Govindhan
-Yes, sir.

1311
01:26:19,680 --> 01:26:22,831
Those 2 boys in the last row

1312
01:26:23,560 --> 01:26:28,714
lf 1 of them gets a job in our campus
interview, l'll remove my moustache

1313
01:26:29,920 --> 01:26:30,557
Okay, sir

1314
01:26:39,840 --> 01:26:40,352
Aiyo!

1315
01:26:40,680 --> 01:26:41,635
He put his usual
missile bomb!

1316
01:26:42,040 --> 01:26:43,234
He merged it
with the sound of the horn!

1317
01:26:43,400 --> 01:26:46,119
Hey septic tank!?
Are you still on that ?????

1318
01:26:46,480 --> 01:26:48,596
l didn't do it
Senthil???

1319
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:50,953
How can we forget
your dead rat smell?

1320
01:27:00,200 --> 01:27:00,916
Venkat, give me your wallet

1321
01:27:01,360 --> 01:27:03,396
2nd half of me is trembling
l'll get myself a pant

1322
01:27:03,640 --> 01:27:05,517
Why waste money?
Vatsan's suit is here

1323
01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:06,317
Put it on

1324
01:27:07,040 --> 01:27:08,598
Don't touch my shirt
lt will get dirty

1325
01:27:09,400 --> 01:27:09,752
Forget it

1326
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:11,399
Pari can identify you
even if you are in your boxers!

1327
01:27:11,960 --> 01:27:15,794
Sweater uncle, tell us how
to reach this place?

1328
01:27:16,440 --> 01:27:18,795
Why would l be selling
sweaters, if l can read this?

1329
01:27:19,120 --> 01:27:20,235
Poor man
He doesn't know to read

1330
01:27:20,520 --> 01:27:21,111
Do you intend to rape him?!

1331
01:27:22,480 --> 01:27:24,118
- You can talk?
- Yes

1332
01:27:24,640 --> 01:27:27,074
Do you know where
Panchavan Parivendhan lives?

1333
01:27:27,320 --> 01:27:28,594
Over there

1334
01:27:33,360 --> 01:27:33,792
Come, let's go

1335
01:27:41,440 --> 01:27:43,749
- Vatsan, your gnyana sundi churnam
-Thank you

1336
01:27:44,040 --> 01:27:45,109
- Where have you found?
- ln your pocket.

1337
01:27:45,400 --> 01:27:46,913
How dare you?!
That's my pant

1338
01:27:47,320 --> 01:27:48,196
Why do you differentiate
as yours and mine

1339
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:49,469
Bhagavd Gita says
everything belongs to everyone

1340
01:27:49,680 --> 01:27:50,715
Shut up!
l want my pant

1341
01:27:51,680 --> 01:27:52,112
Remove it

1342
01:27:52,960 --> 01:27:54,951
People might think

1343
01:28:04,960 --> 01:28:05,551
What happened?

1344
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:08,270
Pari's dad...

1345
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:16,719
-Where is Pari?
-Over there

1346
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:17,630
l feel awful

1347
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:20,994
As long as he was alive
he was everything to us

1348
01:28:21,280 --> 01:28:22,872
2 days back, l met him at
the collector's office

1349
01:28:29,120 --> 01:28:29,757
Pari?

1350
01:28:30,600 --> 01:28:31,112
Yes

1351
01:28:34,040 --> 01:28:34,597
Where is Pari?

1352
01:28:35,640 --> 01:28:36,197
- l am Pari!

1353
01:28:36,960 --> 01:28:39,428
l mean
Panchavarnan Parivendhan

1354
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:42,676
That's me

1355
01:28:43,080 --> 01:28:43,990
Tell me

1356
01:28:47,040 --> 01:28:49,235
Pari has changed
beyond recognition!

1357
01:28:51,800 --> 01:28:53,552
Pari, be brave

1358
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:12,392
Panchavan Parivendhan

1359
01:29:17,480 --> 01:29:18,151
Oi!

1360
01:29:37,720 --> 01:29:40,553
Same name, photo and degree
But person is different

1361
01:29:41,320 --> 01:29:42,548
Wonder what cover up has happened

1362
01:29:43,040 --> 01:29:45,349
Do you know what deja vu means?

1363
01:29:46,320 --> 01:29:49,596
We feel an event happening now
has already been experienced by us

1364
01:29:50,160 --> 01:29:51,036
lsn't that deja vu?

1365
01:29:52,240 --> 01:29:53,719
Do you know what's jamais vu?

1366
01:29:54,440 --> 01:29:55,156
Oh sure!

1367
01:29:55,840 --> 01:29:57,751
Relieving and not
zipping one's pant

1368
01:29:59,200 --> 01:30:04,035
An extra familiar event seen many times
is totally unfamiliar, as if seen for 1st time

1369
01:30:04,320 --> 01:30:05,355
We are all in the Jamaisvu mode now

1370
01:30:05,960 --> 01:30:08,190
Pari we saw in the photo
is our classmate Pari

1371
01:30:08,480 --> 01:30:10,198
But we have all forgotten
his face and imagine otherwise

1372
01:30:10,480 --> 01:30:12,152
This is my theory...howzatt?

1373
01:30:12,800 --> 01:30:13,596
Bombs you shell out are better!

1374
01:30:15,040 --> 01:30:17,600
How you got the address of Pari?
-- Yeah, tell us how

1375
01:30:18,280 --> 01:30:19,076
Hey! How dare you
take my biscuits?

1376
01:30:19,360 --> 01:30:22,272
l got them from San Francisco
Handmade and expensive

1377
01:30:22,760 --> 01:30:24,512
Specialy made for
Kosaksi Pasapugazh

1378
01:30:24,920 --> 01:30:26,831
Who is that
Kusuksy Pasapugazh?

1379
01:30:27,360 --> 01:30:31,797
Kosaksi Pasapugazh
Great scientitst

1380
01:30:32,360 --> 01:30:34,590
400 patents
World wants him

1381
01:30:34,840 --> 01:30:36,512
Can't meet him that easily

1382
01:30:37,080 --> 01:30:39,799
l've chased him for 1 whole year
and managed to get an appointment

1383
01:30:40,400 --> 01:30:46,748
lf only he signs my company deal
...l'll get a trillion dollar business

1384
01:30:47,360 --> 01:30:50,033
l'll be huuuuuuuuuuuge

1385
01:30:50,960 --> 01:30:54,032
Stop glorifying Pasapugazh
How did you get Pari's address?

1386
01:30:54,320 --> 01:30:55,958
You have to thank
Pasapugazh for that

1387
01:30:56,440 --> 01:31:01,389
My secretary Lara had come here
last month to meet Pasapugazh

1388
01:31:01,840 --> 01:31:04,149
She didn't get an appointment
but she found Pari

1389
01:31:06,720 --> 01:31:09,678
Only 1 man can lead us to Pari

1390
01:31:10,560 --> 01:31:12,198
Dad, forgive me

1391
01:31:12,880 --> 01:31:15,553
l'm a 'sin-ful son' for not
fulfilling your last wish

1392
01:31:16,200 --> 01:31:19,192
You wanted me to take you
on a pilgrimage to Kasi

1393
01:31:20,120 --> 01:31:22,953
l was waiting for the tender for
Optical fiber cable project in Ooty

1394
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:28,037
When l opened the tender
you closed your eyes, dad

1395
01:31:29,680 --> 01:31:30,874
l am sorry, dad

1396
01:31:31,560 --> 01:31:33,198
l haven't been a good son to you

1397
01:31:33,880 --> 01:31:34,949
How can you say this?

1398
01:31:36,520 --> 01:31:38,431
You are an engineer
and college topper

1399
01:31:39,080 --> 01:31:40,832
Your degree certificate is framed and
displayed on the wall for all to see

1400
01:31:41,400 --> 01:31:42,515
You are a very good son

1401
01:31:44,120 --> 01:31:46,429
What audacity to walk into
my house without permission?

1402
01:31:47,440 --> 01:31:48,395
Shall l put you behind bars?

1403
01:31:48,720 --> 01:31:49,835
You'll be the one counting bars

1404
01:31:50,360 --> 01:31:53,158
You've got a Rs15 Crore project with
a forged degree certificate as proof

1405
01:31:53,480 --> 01:31:55,471
That's our friend's degree
How did you get it?

1406
01:31:56,560 --> 01:31:57,231
Tell us

1407
01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:08,954
This is a 150 acre property

1408
01:32:10,360 --> 01:32:12,351
No one will know
if l kill and bury you here

1409
01:32:13,240 --> 01:32:14,389
Pay heed to my words and vanish!

1410
01:32:17,080 --> 01:32:19,071
l have to dissolve
my dad's ashes in Kasi

1411
01:32:20,440 --> 01:32:21,714
Shall l add yours also?

1412
01:32:24,880 --> 01:32:26,393
Oi! Lift his 'dad'!

1413
01:32:30,520 --> 01:32:31,589
Which way to go?

1414
01:32:33,760 --> 01:32:35,716
lt is my dad's
Give it to me

1415
01:32:37,520 --> 01:32:39,033
Tell us who you are

1416
01:32:39,320 --> 01:32:40,958
Or your dad will be dissolved
here instead of a holy place!

1417
01:32:41,240 --> 01:32:42,070
Give my dad's ashes back to me

1418
01:32:42,400 --> 01:32:44,197
Tell me the truth
or shall l empty him here?

1419
01:32:45,240 --> 01:32:46,878
l'll shoot you

1420
01:32:47,920 --> 01:32:49,512
You press the trigger
l'll flush him down the drain

1421
01:32:50,680 --> 01:32:52,113
l'll count till 3

1422
01:32:52,440 --> 01:32:53,589
Dump his dad in, Senthil

1423
01:32:58,040 --> 01:32:58,517
One

1424
01:33:01,400 --> 01:33:03,755
We don't mind dying
We won't let go of your dad

1425
01:33:05,400 --> 01:33:06,071
Two

1426
01:33:06,360 --> 01:33:07,554
Your dad's soul
will never rest in peace

1427
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:08,876
He'll keep haunting this toilet

1428
01:33:11,640 --> 01:33:12,789
No dad in this urn

1429
01:33:14,440 --> 01:33:15,759
We brought the wrong pot!

1430
01:33:16,680 --> 01:33:18,955
- lt is empty.
- Empty.

1431
01:33:20,280 --> 01:33:22,840
Empty it

1432
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:29,671
Hands up

1433
01:33:31,760 --> 01:33:33,796
Tell us now
Who are you?

1434
01:33:34,120 --> 01:33:35,235
Panchavan Parivendhan

1435
01:33:36,760 --> 01:33:40,036
l swear on my dad
whatever l'm saying is true

1436
01:33:40,920 --> 01:33:42,911
l am Pari
He is Pappu

1437
01:33:46,240 --> 01:33:47,309
He is our gardener's son

1438
01:33:48,520 --> 01:33:49,714
All of us called him Pappu

1439
01:33:50,560 --> 01:33:54,473
After his parents passed away
my dad brought him to live with us

1440
01:33:55,120 --> 01:33:58,908
Changing bulb, ironing clothes,
buying bread and eggs...

1441
01:33:59,280 --> 01:34:00,793
...he used to run these
small errands for us

1442
01:34:02,480 --> 01:34:03,959
His deepest desire was to study

1443
01:34:06,680 --> 01:34:08,511
He'd wear my old uniform
and go to school

1444
01:34:11,600 --> 01:34:13,272
He'd sit in whichever class
he liked and learn

1445
01:34:14,560 --> 01:34:15,549
l was a real dud
when it came to academics

1446
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:17,070
l used him

1447
01:34:17,800 --> 01:34:19,597
l asked him
to do my assignments

1448
01:34:20,400 --> 01:34:21,435
He even wrote
my exams for me

1449
01:34:23,120 --> 01:34:24,314
Everything was smooth sailing

1450
01:34:24,920 --> 01:34:25,511
One day...

1451
01:34:26,320 --> 01:34:29,357
...my teacher was stunned that a 6th grader
was able to solve a 10th grade sum

1452
01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:32,709
Which grade are you in, son?

1453
01:34:34,160 --> 01:34:34,956
What's your name?

1454
01:34:36,200 --> 01:34:36,996
We got caught

1455
01:34:38,120 --> 01:34:39,553
Since my dad was a big shot,

1456
01:34:40,640 --> 01:34:42,710
that teacher informed him 1st
...instead of the school principal

1457
01:34:43,360 --> 01:34:45,828
You began
so you complete it

1458
01:34:48,920 --> 01:34:51,798
People here greet me
with respect to my face

1459
01:34:52,560 --> 01:34:55,836
But they ridicule me
behind my back as an illiterate moron

1460
01:34:57,120 --> 01:34:59,156
My son should
never go through this

1461
01:35:00,480 --> 01:35:03,517
This boy wants to learn
My boy needs a degree

1462
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:05,790
Let him become an engineer

1463
01:35:06,360 --> 01:35:10,831
Let his degree certificate hang
on this wall as Panchavan Parivendhan

1464
01:35:12,160 --> 01:35:13,388
l went to London for 4 years

1465
01:35:14,120 --> 01:35:16,554
He studied instead of me in lEC

1466
01:35:17,440 --> 01:35:21,911
My dad made him promise he would
never meet his college mates again

1467
01:35:22,760 --> 01:35:24,159
He said, 'l will never meet anyone

1468
01:35:24,720 --> 01:35:27,553
But one day my 2 friends
will come in search of me for sure

1469
01:35:28,160 --> 01:35:29,354
What will you do, then?'

1470
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:34,228
He misses you both tremendously

1471
01:35:35,280 --> 01:35:36,429
l'll give you his address
Go meet him

1472
01:35:37,520 --> 01:35:38,635
But 1 condition

1473
01:35:39,600 --> 01:35:40,589
No one should
know this secret

1474
01:35:42,600 --> 01:35:43,112
Which secret?

1475
01:35:52,680 --> 01:35:53,954
My dad?!

1476
01:35:56,040 --> 01:35:58,838
Sir, you brought the wrong urn
Your dad is in this one!

1477
01:36:03,240 --> 01:36:03,797
Dad...thank God

1478
01:36:04,280 --> 01:36:06,350
What the hell is going on?
Who ls he?

1479
01:36:06,800 --> 01:36:07,869
Quick gun Murugan

1480
01:36:08,360 --> 01:36:11,033
lts too complicated a story for you
You'll need subtitles!!

1481
01:36:11,760 --> 01:36:13,751
- Where are we now?
- Dhanushkodi.

1482
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,070
- Why?
- To see Pari.

1483
01:36:16,920 --> 01:36:17,830
What is he doing there?

1484
01:36:18,680 --> 01:36:20,193
Don't know
We got the address of his school

1485
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:27,113
So Pari is a school teacher?

1486
01:36:27,560 --> 01:36:29,630
That's why he didn't
meet us at the water tank

1487
01:36:30,040 --> 01:36:32,315
l am Air Pixel lnc's vice president

1488
01:36:32,880 --> 01:36:34,199
He is a school teacher

1489
01:36:34,520 --> 01:36:36,670
A for apple
B for ball

1490
01:36:37,160 --> 01:36:38,115
C for cat

1491
01:36:38,520 --> 01:36:40,431
Yeah and D for donkey
F for fart!

1492
01:36:41,840 --> 01:36:45,833
l'll be signing an international deal with
kosaksi pasapugazh next week

1493
01:36:46,160 --> 01:36:47,229
He's a school teacher

1494
01:36:53,160 --> 01:36:55,549
Our respect for Pari
multiplied even more

1495
01:36:56,640 --> 01:36:57,550
We studied engineering to be

1496
01:36:58,320 --> 01:37:02,393
respected, travel abroad, cushy job
...beautiful wife, own a house

1497
01:37:02,760 --> 01:37:03,988
and car and be well settled

1498
01:37:04,480 --> 01:37:06,550
But he didn't study for any of these

1499
01:37:07,360 --> 01:37:10,113
Just to enhance his knowledge

1500
01:37:10,680 --> 01:37:12,193
He wasn't perturbed
about being last in class

1501
01:37:12,640 --> 01:37:14,312
...or proud of being first

1502
01:37:15,040 --> 01:37:16,792
Who landed in the moon 1st?

1503
01:37:17,320 --> 01:37:18,070
Neil Armstrong, sir

1504
01:37:18,680 --> 01:37:20,511
Obviously
it's Neil Armstrong

1505
01:37:20,920 --> 01:37:21,716
We all know that

1506
01:37:22,960 --> 01:37:24,473
Who was the 2nd to place his foot?

1507
01:37:26,080 --> 01:37:27,832
That's also Neil Armstrong, sir

1508
01:37:29,440 --> 01:37:30,589
How can he walk on 1 foot?!

1509
01:37:33,120 --> 01:37:33,711
Quiet

1510
01:37:36,520 --> 01:37:40,957
Who was the 2nd man?

1511
01:37:44,880 --> 01:37:47,952
Don't waste your time
lts not important

1512
01:37:49,040 --> 01:37:54,717
This world will never
remember the 2nd in tow

1513
01:37:56,680 --> 01:38:02,869
2 months ago we had 25 companies
with job offers for all of you

1514
01:38:03,840 --> 01:38:07,628
Which means you have a job in your hand
before you write your final exam

1515
01:38:09,360 --> 01:38:10,918
This is your last lap, my friends

1516
01:38:12,040 --> 01:38:13,155
Put your pedal to the metal

1517
01:38:13,640 --> 01:38:16,791
Accelerate and go out there
and make history

1518
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:20,637
Any questions?

1519
01:38:22,880 --> 01:38:23,915
Yes

1520
01:38:25,240 --> 01:38:27,674
if l get a job

1521
01:38:28,640 --> 01:38:30,995
but plug...
...fail the exams

1522
01:38:32,080 --> 01:38:33,513
will l still get the job?

1523
01:38:33,880 --> 01:38:34,835
Very good question

1524
01:38:36,880 --> 01:38:38,916
Does anyone else
share this doubt?

1525
01:38:41,800 --> 01:38:42,596
l thought as much

1526
01:38:44,240 --> 01:38:46,629
Please come onto the stage

1527
01:38:47,600 --> 01:38:49,192
Everybody give them a big hand

1528
01:38:57,120 --> 01:39:01,875
Past 4 years in lEC they have
continuously created history

1529
01:39:03,320 --> 01:39:04,196
...in occupying the last place!

1530
01:39:08,080 --> 01:39:12,631
Brains of these genius guys
if sold will fetch a hefty sum

1531
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:13,637
Do you know why?

1532
01:39:14,760 --> 01:39:17,320
Brains without
wear and tear

1533
01:39:22,440 --> 01:39:24,032
And to answer their question

1534
01:39:25,080 --> 01:39:29,631
...whether they pass or fail
theirjob won't be affected

1535
01:39:31,040 --> 01:39:33,600
...because they will not get a job!

1536
01:39:34,320 --> 01:39:35,116
l guarantee it

1537
01:39:36,400 --> 01:39:40,075
Names of these achievers
should be etched in gold

1538
01:39:41,240 --> 01:39:43,629
BlSENTHlLATOR
DRlVENKATRlNATlON

1539
01:39:45,080 --> 01:39:48,072
Please give them a big hand

1540
01:39:53,360 --> 01:39:56,955
He has raped us to the core
and torn our undies to shreds!!!

1541
01:39:57,560 --> 01:39:58,151
...publicly

1542
01:39:58,440 --> 01:39:58,872
God-dy buddy!

1543
01:40:00,920 --> 01:40:03,559
l'll come by foot to all your abodes!

1544
01:40:04,640 --> 01:40:08,918
But please stamp that Virus fella's ticket
and haul him to hell immediately

1545
01:40:10,280 --> 01:40:12,350
Can't tolerate his torture

1546
01:40:14,920 --> 01:40:19,072
Lord Yama, l beseach you
with folded hands

1547
01:40:20,040 --> 01:40:21,473
Please sentence him to
kumbhipaakam

1548
01:40:22,480 --> 01:40:23,151
That means?

1549
01:40:23,680 --> 01:40:25,079
Fry him alive in a huge tureen

1550
01:40:25,640 --> 01:40:29,110
He is ordering a special fry
Side-dish Virus 65!

1551
01:40:30,960 --> 01:40:31,551
Hey! You keep quiet

1552
01:40:32,720 --> 01:40:36,030
You happily seat yourself
in the front row next to Virus

1553
01:40:37,120 --> 01:40:39,714
We are the duds decorating
the corner of the last row

1554
01:40:40,880 --> 01:40:44,111
We don't even know
if we'll be in the picture next year

1555
01:40:46,160 --> 01:40:49,277
- Do you know why l top the class?
- Because we are last!

1556
01:40:51,880 --> 01:40:56,556
l like machines, that's why
l am enamored by engineering

1557
01:40:57,960 --> 01:40:59,552
Shall l tell you
what you are interested in?

1558
01:41:00,160 --> 01:41:00,637
ln what?

1559
01:41:02,760 --> 01:41:03,237
My bag, huh?

1560
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:05,513
Why are you meddling in my bag?

1561
01:41:08,280 --> 01:41:08,632
Here

1562
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,753
This is your interest
Go and post this 1st

1563
01:41:18,280 --> 01:41:23,718
5 years back this is the letter he wrote
to his favorite wild life photographer

1564
01:41:24,560 --> 01:41:26,869
What's his name?
BMW...

1565
01:41:27,440 --> 01:41:28,316
Benz Mathe

1566
01:41:31,080 --> 01:41:34,356
He wanted to apprentice
under him and work in Hungary

1567
01:41:35,280 --> 01:41:37,714
...but terrified of his dad
Hitler Ramakrishnan

1568
01:41:38,640 --> 01:41:40,073
...he never posted that letter

1569
01:41:42,200 --> 01:41:43,792
Dump engineering

1570
01:41:44,720 --> 01:41:46,278
Follow your dream
Wild life photography

1571
01:41:47,600 --> 01:41:50,273
Pursue your talent

1572
01:41:53,840 --> 01:41:58,072
What if A.R Rehman's dad
wanted him to be a great batsman

1573
01:41:59,360 --> 01:42:04,480
...or if Sachin Tendulkar's dad
wanted him to be an international composer

1574
01:42:05,320 --> 01:42:06,070
lmagine their respective plight

1575
01:42:07,120 --> 01:42:11,796
He loves photography
and wants to marry machines

1576
01:42:13,560 --> 01:42:14,515
Fooling yourself

1577
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:18,228
Sorry Pari-anandha

1578
01:42:20,320 --> 01:42:24,074
My love and wife
are both engineering

1579
01:42:24,760 --> 01:42:26,352
But tell me why
am l always last?

1580
01:42:27,560 --> 01:42:30,074
Tell me, Guruji

1581
01:42:31,880 --> 01:42:33,552
Because you are a coward

1582
01:42:34,680 --> 01:42:37,069
Scaredy cat
afraid of the future

1583
01:42:38,600 --> 01:42:42,070
Look at the number
of vow-threads on his wrist

1584
01:42:42,760 --> 01:42:45,672
1 for exam
1 for sister's wedding

1585
01:42:46,160 --> 01:42:46,990
1 for a decentjob

1586
01:42:49,560 --> 01:42:51,437
lf you are so worried
about your future

1587
01:42:51,640 --> 01:42:52,868
...how can you live life today?

1588
01:42:54,240 --> 01:42:56,151
How can you
be focused in your studies?

1589
01:42:56,600 --> 01:42:57,828
You make the thickest of friends

1590
01:42:58,600 --> 01:42:59,953
One is so petrified
he's dying all the time

1591
01:43:00,880 --> 01:43:01,995
The other is trying his best
to live by not dying!

1592
01:43:02,880 --> 01:43:04,359
He is the bravest of us all!

1593
01:43:04,640 --> 01:43:04,992
Why?

1594
01:43:05,920 --> 01:43:06,989
Are you not living a scared life?

1595
01:43:07,480 --> 01:43:08,356
Why am l scared?

1596
01:43:08,840 --> 01:43:10,114
You love Ria

1597
01:43:11,160 --> 01:43:12,878
Aren't you scared
to profess your love to her?

1598
01:43:14,080 --> 01:43:15,069
Bingo!

1599
01:43:15,720 --> 01:43:16,675
Keep quiet

1600
01:43:18,120 --> 01:43:19,838
lt's easy to give free advice

1601
01:43:20,480 --> 01:43:23,711
But to follow it is darn tough

1602
01:43:26,200 --> 01:43:28,953
lf you really have the courage
go and tell Ria

1603
01:43:30,760 --> 01:43:35,197
lf you tell
l ll also tell my dad

1604
01:43:35,600 --> 01:43:38,990
l want to follow my heart
l'll only be a photographer

1605
01:43:41,280 --> 01:43:45,910
l'll also remove all my sacred threads
and attend interview with confidence

1606
01:43:46,360 --> 01:43:46,997
Promise

1607
01:43:48,400 --> 01:43:49,150
Go and tell

1608
01:43:52,640 --> 01:43:54,790
Pari-anandha's halo
is switched off!

1609
01:43:55,400 --> 01:43:57,197
Go ahead
Fraidy cat

1610
01:44:07,560 --> 01:44:08,072
Come with me

1611
01:44:08,400 --> 01:44:09,116
Where?

1612
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:11,115
To cover your head
and sweet dreams!

1613
01:44:16,200 --> 01:44:20,716
Hey! Principal
Saturday is your funeral

1614
01:44:21,320 --> 01:44:22,833
Check out if there's a dog

1615
01:44:23,280 --> 01:44:24,872
Why? ls your tummy
somersaulting?

1616
01:44:31,360 --> 01:44:33,476
l'll break each tooth
of yours 1 by 1

1617
01:44:37,680 --> 01:44:39,830
Virus bacteria!

1618
01:44:43,360 --> 01:44:44,315
Sssssshhhh!

1619
01:44:46,760 --> 01:44:49,274
M.S.V.E
More Spicy Very Embarrassing

1620
01:45:00,440 --> 01:45:01,475
l'll give the back ground score

1621
01:45:05,040 --> 01:45:06,268
-Ria
- Who is it?

1622
01:45:09,560 --> 01:45:12,438
Don't make a noise
l am Panchavan Parivendhan

1623
01:45:14,840 --> 01:45:18,719
Listen to me 2 nimutes!

1624
01:45:19,720 --> 01:45:20,948
l'll leave after that

1625
01:45:22,160 --> 01:45:25,516
Why spend time talking?
Whatjoy does that bring?

1626
01:45:28,920 --> 01:45:29,432
Ria

1627
01:45:31,960 --> 01:45:34,474
Those 20 minutes l shared with you
in that scooter ride

1628
01:45:38,840 --> 01:45:42,276
... is the mosT beautiful
moments l'll treasure, all-ways

1629
01:45:49,440 --> 01:45:55,390
l want my whole journey of life
to be shared in that saaaaame way

1630
01:45:56,040 --> 01:45:56,756
Wowwww!

1631
01:45:59,440 --> 01:46:02,432
Just that thought
gives me a high!

1632
01:46:10,680 --> 01:46:11,430
Tell you, something

1633
01:46:13,240 --> 01:46:16,676
You come in my dream
daily in that same scooter

1634
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:19,319
...as my bride dressed in
your wedding finery

1635
01:46:21,800 --> 01:46:26,510
You remove your helmet
and come close to kiss me

1636
01:46:29,080 --> 01:46:30,115
...but the kiss gets missed

1637
01:46:31,200 --> 01:46:31,632
Why?

1638
01:46:32,640 --> 01:46:34,596
Our noses collide!
l woke up

1639
01:46:37,720 --> 01:46:38,391
idiot!

1640
01:46:38,880 --> 01:46:40,791
You could have bent
your head a little and kissed her

1641
01:46:45,560 --> 01:46:49,075
Sss-o-rry
l thought you were Ria

1642
01:46:49,760 --> 01:46:50,636
Could have been Ria

1643
01:46:51,600 --> 01:46:52,191
l'll kill you

1644
01:46:52,560 --> 01:46:53,436
Why did you spoil the fun?

1645
01:46:54,240 --> 01:46:55,992
lt took 'sir' 4 years to
muster up courage to say this

1646
01:46:56,720 --> 01:46:59,314
Ria, show him how to kiss
without your noses colliding

1647
01:46:59,960 --> 01:47:00,949
l grant you permission

1648
01:47:02,240 --> 01:47:03,036
Who is this?

1649
01:47:03,360 --> 01:47:03,917
My sister

1650
01:47:04,400 --> 01:47:05,037
- That one, who is it?

1651
01:47:05,440 --> 01:47:05,917
- His sister!

1652
01:47:11,600 --> 01:47:12,396
Stupid

1653
01:47:15,560 --> 01:47:18,120
He kicked me for the 1st time
when you were talking to me

1654
01:47:19,680 --> 01:47:20,157
He?

1655
01:47:22,200 --> 01:47:25,909
How do you know
he or she?

1656
01:47:26,360 --> 01:47:27,429
My dad consulted an astrologer

1657
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,514
...to ask if baby will be
doctor or engineer

1658
01:47:32,080 --> 01:47:33,479
Boy means engineer
Girl means doctor

1659
01:47:36,320 --> 01:47:39,198
Champ! You stay right in
Safer that way

1660
01:47:40,200 --> 01:47:41,633
lt's a circus out here

1661
01:47:42,800 --> 01:47:43,994
Your grandpa is the ring master

1662
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:46,672
He'll be whipping
everyone with his stick

1663
01:47:47,880 --> 01:47:51,429
Life is a race...run
Become an engineer

1664
01:47:54,200 --> 01:47:59,320
...but you listen to your heart

1665
01:48:00,520 --> 01:48:01,873
lf anyone bullies you

1666
01:48:03,200 --> 01:48:04,599
...put your hand
on your heart and simply say

1667
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:06,910
'All is well'

1668
01:48:07,640 --> 01:48:08,038
He's kicking

1669
01:48:08,920 --> 01:48:09,670
Repeat

1670
01:48:11,760 --> 01:48:12,715
All is well

1671
01:48:13,480 --> 01:48:15,038
He's kicking me again

1672
01:48:19,360 --> 01:48:22,318
All is well

1673
01:48:23,040 --> 01:48:24,314
Who is that?

1674
01:48:24,800 --> 01:48:25,949
Are you sending
my father a letter?

1675
01:48:26,360 --> 01:48:27,918
Here's your reply

1676
01:48:29,080 --> 01:48:29,990
go....GO!

1677
01:48:42,480 --> 01:48:43,037
Stand right there

1678
01:48:43,560 --> 01:48:44,072
You sit right there!

1679
01:48:44,400 --> 01:48:44,957
Who is that?

1680
01:48:45,480 --> 01:48:47,198
Your future son-in-law, Virus

1681
01:48:48,760 --> 01:48:50,512
We are your son-in-law's best men

1682
01:48:51,960 --> 01:48:53,234
Sevarkodi Senthil

1683
01:48:53,600 --> 01:48:55,238
Security!
Catch them

1684
01:49:22,240 --> 01:49:25,312
Next is advanced study
of compound pendulum

1685
01:49:26,720 --> 01:49:28,551
lts an irregular object
oscillating about its own axis

1686
01:49:30,040 --> 01:49:31,268
Let me demonstrate

1687
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:33,198
What is this?

1688
01:49:34,800 --> 01:49:35,391
What's inside?

1689
01:49:37,520 --> 01:49:38,873
Lead is the access
to this pencil

1690
01:49:41,240 --> 01:49:44,437
For a real pendulum
consisting of a swinging rigid body

1691
01:49:44,920 --> 01:49:47,878
...called a compound pendulum
length is more difficult to define

1692
01:49:49,120 --> 01:49:52,271
So a real pendulum swings
with the same period

1693
01:49:52,920 --> 01:49:56,833
...as a simple pendulum with
length = distance from pivot point

1694
01:49:59,360 --> 01:49:59,792
Where's Senthil?

1695
01:50:00,760 --> 01:50:01,351
Present, sir

1696
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:09,353
You are all here?

1697
01:50:12,120 --> 01:50:13,633
Good morning, sir

1698
01:50:13,840 --> 01:50:14,670
Where were you last night?

1699
01:50:16,040 --> 01:50:16,950
He was studying all night through

1700
01:50:17,720 --> 01:50:18,709
He was up whole night

1701
01:50:19,080 --> 01:50:19,478
Really?

1702
01:50:20,800 --> 01:50:24,349
2continuous nights of studying
he's drained out, sir

1703
01:50:25,640 --> 01:50:26,356
What are you blabbering?

1704
01:50:26,920 --> 01:50:29,036
What did 'sir' study to this extent
of getting dehydrated?!

1705
01:50:30,200 --> 01:50:33,033
lnduction motor, sir
Full chapter

1706
01:50:36,560 --> 01:50:38,869
ln that case, Mr Sevarkodi Senthil

1707
01:50:40,600 --> 01:50:44,479
...can you tell us
how an induction motor starts?

1708
01:50:57,200 --> 01:50:57,757
Oi! Stop

1709
01:50:58,600 --> 01:50:59,032
Stop it

1710
01:51:09,040 --> 01:51:10,632
Sir?
Rummmmm

1711
01:51:14,320 --> 01:51:16,470
-Mr Senthil
-Yes, sir.

1712
01:51:17,160 --> 01:51:19,435
Let's have a cup of tea
in my office.- Okay

1713
01:51:23,240 --> 01:51:23,831
Sir?

1714
01:51:25,760 --> 01:51:26,237
Close the door

1715
01:51:28,160 --> 01:51:29,673
Do you know to type?

1716
01:51:30,600 --> 01:51:31,157
l know, sir

1717
01:51:31,840 --> 01:51:33,193
Come..sit

1718
01:51:34,600 --> 01:51:35,510
l am sorry, sir

1719
01:51:35,800 --> 01:51:36,710
Please type

1720
01:51:38,520 --> 01:51:43,833
Dear sir,
l regret to inform you

1721
01:51:45,040 --> 01:51:45,711
that your son

1722
01:51:47,040 --> 01:51:50,669
...due to misconduct and
insubordination has been

1723
01:51:51,080 --> 01:51:52,718
No...no, delete it

1724
01:51:53,480 --> 01:51:53,878
Go back

1725
01:51:55,320 --> 01:52:01,156
...your son Sevarkodi Senthil
has been expelled from this college

1726
01:52:04,520 --> 01:52:08,035
Come on, type
Go ahead

1727
01:52:09,640 --> 01:52:12,108
Sir, my father will die

1728
01:52:12,800 --> 01:52:15,109
My decision is final

1729
01:52:16,920 --> 01:52:20,549
He is alive...barely
Only to see me as an engineer

1730
01:52:21,160 --> 01:52:24,038
You should have thought of it
before peeing in front of my house!

1731
01:52:25,080 --> 01:52:27,594
Just forgive me this 1 time, sir

1732
01:52:32,680 --> 01:52:35,069
Okay, delete your name
from the letter

1733
01:52:37,520 --> 01:52:40,956
Substitute it with
Panchavan Parivendhan

1734
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:46,995
l know he was with you, last night

1735
01:52:48,040 --> 01:52:50,838
Become an approver
l'll forgive you

1736
01:52:53,160 --> 01:52:55,913
l'll give you 7 1/2 minutes time
Think deeply and let me know

1737
01:53:44,440 --> 01:53:54,395
Does death also need
a 'good friend' on its side?

1738
01:53:55,640 --> 01:54:07,632
Deciding you are the best
death is dying for your last ride

1739
01:54:13,360 --> 01:54:23,031
God, dear God,
why do You need his life?

1740
01:54:24,400 --> 01:54:33,798
Take our lives instead,
why create this strife?

1741
01:54:34,880 --> 01:54:45,199
He is our rose shrub perennial
can death gulp him down?

1742
01:54:45,920 --> 01:54:49,037
Return his moments of laughter

1743
01:54:49,280 --> 01:54:50,599
Pari, look at that monitor

1744
01:54:52,560 --> 01:54:54,312
Shock due to the fall
has paralyzed the body

1745
01:54:54,800 --> 01:54:55,630
But his mind is alert

1746
01:54:56,560 --> 01:54:58,710
He can see us,
hear what we say

1747
01:54:59,000 --> 01:54:59,876
...but he cannot respond

1748
01:55:01,120 --> 01:55:02,394
Don't cry in front of him

1749
01:55:02,920 --> 01:55:05,354
Be normal
Motivate him

1750
01:55:06,280 --> 01:55:08,032
Make him happy
Make him laugh

1751
01:55:11,600 --> 01:55:13,750
Senthil, good news

1752
01:55:14,640 --> 01:55:16,278
Your dad is completely cured

1753
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:18,797
Ria got a new drug from USA

1754
01:55:20,440 --> 01:55:22,670
Do you have some kind of family vow?

1755
01:55:23,120 --> 01:55:24,633
One gets vertical
while the other goes horizontal

1756
01:55:25,400 --> 01:55:25,798
Get up

1757
01:55:26,520 --> 01:55:28,351
lt seems he loved
that midnight scooter ride

1758
01:55:28,880 --> 01:55:31,269
You won't believe this
He's now taken Ria's scooter

1759
01:55:31,480 --> 01:55:32,674
...to buy medicine for you

1760
01:55:33,480 --> 01:55:34,993
l hope he won't
create a major dent!

1761
01:55:41,640 --> 01:55:42,755
Venkat wants to talk to you

1762
01:55:43,240 --> 01:55:44,514
Through our hostel webcam

1763
01:55:45,840 --> 01:55:49,310
Virus has cancelled your suspension
Problem solved

1764
01:55:49,680 --> 01:55:50,351
Get up

1765
01:55:50,880 --> 01:55:53,633
We'll all go back
to college like old times

1766
01:55:54,080 --> 01:55:55,195
Cheer up, man

1767
01:55:57,920 --> 01:56:08,478
ln the abyss of your memory
can't you hear our voices talk?

1768
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:18,511
ln the upper storey of your heart
'down memory lane' can't you walk?

1769
01:56:18,760 --> 01:56:20,910
Happy birthday to you

1770
01:56:21,760 --> 01:56:22,476
Oi! Your favorite rum

1771
01:56:47,800 --> 01:56:50,439
Your mother's in a brand new sari

1772
01:56:50,720 --> 01:56:51,550
ln an exclusive shop

1773
01:56:52,080 --> 01:56:53,479
Her favorite purple

1774
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:55,194
lt's 2000 bucks, l believe

1775
01:56:55,440 --> 01:56:55,952
Look at your mother

1776
01:56:58,640 --> 01:57:00,073
Don't l look like yesteryear
actress K.R.Vijaya?

1777
01:57:00,480 --> 01:57:02,152
Notjust 1
but 10 sarees

1778
01:57:03,440 --> 01:57:04,270
Look at me

1779
01:57:05,440 --> 01:57:13,836
God, dear God
how can YOU lack mercy?

1780
01:57:16,240 --> 01:57:25,194
Despite her anguished cries
apathetic, how can you be?

1781
01:57:34,480 --> 01:57:36,232
Jaya

1782
01:57:38,040 --> 01:57:38,870
You know what?

1783
01:57:39,400 --> 01:57:40,549
Jaya's wedding has been fixed

1784
01:57:42,200 --> 01:57:47,957
Without even 10 paise dowry
Groom wants only Jaya

1785
01:57:48,320 --> 01:57:49,639
- That Jaya.
- lt's true.

1786
01:57:52,160 --> 01:57:53,798
Do you know who the groom is?

1787
01:57:55,840 --> 01:57:56,795
Take a wild guess!

1788
01:57:57,200 --> 01:57:58,349
Even you know him very well

1789
01:57:58,760 --> 01:58:00,318
He loves animals!

1790
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:03,638
l believe he wants to become
a wild life photographer

1791
01:58:04,320 --> 01:58:04,752
Believe me

1792
01:58:05,920 --> 01:58:07,035
Desperate idiot!
You are dead meat, man

1793
01:58:07,840 --> 01:58:09,159
Groom is no one
but...

1794
01:58:09,400 --> 01:58:11,197
...our Venkat!

1795
01:58:11,840 --> 01:58:13,637
We don't even have to spend on
photography for the wedding!

1796
01:58:14,160 --> 01:58:15,309
He'll click his own wedding snap

1797
01:58:15,960 --> 01:58:18,838
He's marrying your sister

1798
01:58:21,240 --> 01:58:24,232
Groom is free
Absolutely free

1799
01:58:33,360 --> 01:58:33,872
Senthil

1800
01:58:46,360 --> 01:58:47,270
Wowww! Look at his response

1801
01:58:47,960 --> 01:58:48,836
Senthil!

1802
01:58:51,320 --> 01:58:54,039
He'd have sat up like this even if you had
offered him tomatoes and onions!

1803
01:58:54,480 --> 01:58:55,833
How unfair to make me
lamb for the slaughter?

1804
01:58:58,680 --> 01:58:59,476
Buddy

1805
01:59:01,080 --> 01:59:01,796
Thanks Venkat

1806
01:59:02,800 --> 01:59:03,755
Your sacrifice is beyond compare!

1807
01:59:04,240 --> 01:59:05,070
Everything is fixed

1808
01:59:05,240 --> 01:59:07,708
Venkat has promised to marry your sister
in the next earliest auspicious day

1809
01:59:09,480 --> 01:59:09,992
Pari

1810
01:59:17,400 --> 01:59:18,913
ls there no limit
to your fibbing spree?

1811
01:59:23,840 --> 01:59:24,875
You had a great escape!

1812
01:59:42,480 --> 01:59:51,434
Buddy, my best friend,
shall l lend you my shoulder?

1813
01:59:53,640 --> 02:00:03,231
Every single day of your life
l'll be there for you, forever

1814
02:00:06,080 --> 02:00:06,796
Did you order a taxi?

1815
02:00:08,480 --> 02:00:09,037
l called for it

1816
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:10,432
Why do you need a taxi?

1817
02:00:11,320 --> 02:00:12,196
l'm attending our campus interview

1818
02:00:12,600 --> 02:00:13,191
Are you also attending it?

1819
02:00:13,960 --> 02:00:16,713
No, l am
You are going home

1820
02:00:18,480 --> 02:00:19,469
Why should l go home?

1821
02:00:20,680 --> 02:00:23,240
Don't you remember
we promised Pari that day?

1822
02:00:27,320 --> 02:00:28,070
Give me your tie

1823
02:00:28,600 --> 02:00:29,953
Don't play the fool
l'm going for the interview now

1824
02:00:30,760 --> 02:00:33,069
if you read this, l don't think
you will go for the interview

1825
02:00:33,560 --> 02:00:35,073
- What is it?
- A letter.

1826
02:00:36,520 --> 02:00:38,988
Benz Mathe from Hungary

1827
02:00:40,040 --> 02:00:40,995
Photographer it seems

1828
02:00:46,080 --> 02:00:46,990
You posted that letter?

1829
02:00:47,680 --> 02:00:49,989
lnternship for 1 year
in Brazilian rain forest

1830
02:00:51,760 --> 02:00:53,079
This face of yours
even gets a stipend!

1831
02:01:02,320 --> 02:01:03,275
My dad won't accept

1832
02:01:07,320 --> 02:01:12,792
Go and open your heart to him
Be brave. Convince your dad

1833
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:20,394
lf you have 2nd thoughts today
you'll regret this till you die

1834
02:01:22,760 --> 02:01:27,595
Everyone in their lives
will arrive at a crossroad

1835
02:01:29,240 --> 02:01:33,438
One side points to a campus interview
cushy life, a steady 9 to 5 job

1836
02:01:34,280 --> 02:01:38,717
The other side leads to a forest,
animals and photography

1837
02:01:42,160 --> 02:01:45,038
This will be the turning point in your life

1838
02:01:46,280 --> 02:01:46,996
Make up your mind

1839
02:01:55,680 --> 02:01:56,556
Will he like this gift?

1840
02:01:57,480 --> 02:02:00,392
We are already
knee deep in debts

1841
02:02:00,880 --> 02:02:03,235
ls this laptop necessary now?
That too, so expensive

1842
02:02:03,880 --> 02:02:08,112
Don't be silly
lt's his 1stjob

1843
02:02:09,680 --> 02:02:11,272
Our dream for decades
will be realized shortly

1844
02:02:12,760 --> 02:02:13,636
How can you be scrimping now?

1845
02:02:15,160 --> 02:02:15,672
Venkat!?

1846
02:02:22,240 --> 02:02:23,912
lsn't it your campus interview today?

1847
02:02:26,640 --> 02:02:27,197
l didn't go, dad

1848
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:28,352
Why?

1849
02:02:30,600 --> 02:02:32,192
l don't want to be an engineer, dad

1850
02:02:39,560 --> 02:02:41,437
What happened?
Accident?

1851
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:47,788
l jumped from my college building, sir

1852
02:02:50,760 --> 02:02:51,351
Why?

1853
02:02:53,320 --> 02:02:55,709
They dismissed me from college

1854
02:02:56,360 --> 02:02:56,792
For what?

1855
02:02:57,840 --> 02:03:02,755
l got drunk and peed
in front of our principal's house

1856
02:03:04,840 --> 02:03:08,037
That tattered tramp Pari
has brain washed you

1857
02:03:08,520 --> 02:03:10,033
l am not inclined
towards engineering, dad

1858
02:03:10,760 --> 02:03:13,069
Even if l become one
l'd be the worst engineer ever

1859
02:03:15,360 --> 02:03:20,912
Pari's simple belief is, do what you love
Then it won't be just a job, but sheerjoy!

1860
02:03:21,880 --> 02:03:24,997
What will you earn in
that middle-of- nowhere?

1861
02:03:25,880 --> 02:03:29,031
l won't earn much
But l'll learn a lot

1862
02:03:30,120 --> 02:03:33,317
ln 5 years, your classmates will be
well settled with car, bungalow etc

1863
02:03:33,920 --> 02:03:34,830
You'll feel bad, then

1864
02:03:35,160 --> 02:03:36,070
l'll be happy, dad

1865
02:03:37,760 --> 02:03:40,035
Only if l become an engineer
life-long l'll feel terrible

1866
02:03:40,680 --> 02:03:41,795
You'll be the laughing stock of our city!

1867
02:03:42,320 --> 02:03:45,471
Everyone's feeling so proud
my son will become an engineer

1868
02:03:46,560 --> 02:03:48,630
'To study in lEC, your son
must be truly blessed'

1869
02:03:48,760 --> 02:03:49,749
...Krishnamurthy uncle
says this all the time

1870
02:03:51,600 --> 02:03:52,635
What will they think now?

1871
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:56,116
Krishnamurthy uncle did not install
an air-conditioner in my room, dad

1872
02:03:57,080 --> 02:03:58,798
He did not pay my fees, dad

1873
02:04:00,160 --> 02:04:04,790
When l was a kid, he did not
carry me around the zoo, dad

1874
02:04:05,600 --> 02:04:06,715
You did all of this, dad

1875
02:04:07,400 --> 02:04:09,118
Only what you did matters to me, dad

1876
02:04:09,920 --> 02:04:12,275
Have you just come back from
watching a melodramatic film?

1877
02:04:12,920 --> 02:04:13,636
Don't give me dialogs!

1878
02:04:14,360 --> 02:04:17,909
Don't lose your cool
He's already upset

1879
02:04:18,360 --> 02:04:21,591
He might follow
Senthil's footsteps?

1880
02:04:22,840 --> 02:04:23,636
l shouldn't open my mouth

1881
02:04:25,720 --> 02:04:27,950
Fine, l won't utter a single word

1882
02:04:28,880 --> 02:04:32,111
lf l say something
'sir' will jump to his death!

1883
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:36,276
l won't commit suicide, dad
l promise

1884
02:04:39,880 --> 02:04:41,757
Dad, look at this

1885
02:04:43,320 --> 02:04:46,312
Pari kept your photo in my wallet
Do you know what he said?

1886
02:04:47,080 --> 02:04:50,516
lf ever you think of ending
your life, look at this snap

1887
02:04:51,520 --> 02:04:56,719
Just imagine what will happen
to their smile, if they see you dead

1888
02:05:02,280 --> 02:05:08,515
Dad, l'm here to talk frankly with you
Not threaten to commit suicide

1889
02:05:11,600 --> 02:05:15,195
Dad, what will happen
if l become a photographer?

1890
02:05:17,080 --> 02:05:17,910
l'll get less salary

1891
02:05:18,600 --> 02:05:20,431
Small house and small car

1892
02:05:22,120 --> 02:05:23,348
But my happiness will be unlimited, dad

1893
02:05:24,720 --> 02:05:25,516
l'll be very happy

1894
02:05:27,240 --> 02:05:33,395
l'll be contented if l can get
both of you simple new clothes

1895
02:05:34,680 --> 02:05:36,750
l've always listened to you
and toed your line

1896
02:05:37,800 --> 02:05:40,872
Just this once
let me listen to my heart

1897
02:05:43,040 --> 02:05:43,631
Please, dad

1898
02:05:58,080 --> 02:05:59,115
l'll return this

1899
02:06:02,400 --> 02:06:07,474
Venkat, how much will
a professional camera cost?

1900
02:06:09,480 --> 02:06:12,392
We can exchange this
and get you a camera

1901
02:06:15,280 --> 02:06:17,032
l'll pay extra if need be

1902
02:06:34,040 --> 02:06:34,677
You follow your heart

1903
02:06:36,160 --> 02:06:38,310
Why do you have
such low grades in all semesters?

1904
02:06:39,520 --> 02:06:40,191
Fear, sir

1905
02:06:42,120 --> 02:06:45,192
ln the beginning l was scoring
good grades in school

1906
02:06:47,240 --> 02:06:51,836
My parents always felt
l'd solve their financial burden

1907
02:06:53,240 --> 02:06:54,389
That's when my fear started

1908
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:58,070
l studied in a convent school till 5th grade

1909
02:06:59,400 --> 02:07:04,713
l was shifted to a tamil medium, Govt. school,
since we couldn't afford to pay the fees

1910
02:07:06,680 --> 02:07:09,319
When l came here and saw
everyone speaking English fluently

1911
02:07:10,480 --> 02:07:11,230
...l was terrified

1912
02:07:12,480 --> 02:07:13,993
My fear multiplied

1913
02:07:16,080 --> 02:07:17,752
There's a huge race here

1914
02:07:18,960 --> 02:07:21,713
lf you don't catch the 1st place
you are not respected

1915
02:07:22,920 --> 02:07:23,875
My fear became permanent

1916
02:07:25,440 --> 02:07:27,908
Fear is a huge hindrance to studies, sir

1917
02:07:29,600 --> 02:07:30,794
l prayed to all Gods
known and unknown

1918
02:07:31,640 --> 02:07:32,675
l tied various sacred threads on my wrist

1919
02:07:32,960 --> 02:07:35,599
l begged God to make
my zillion wishes to come true

1920
02:07:38,120 --> 02:07:41,317
l'd have been better off studying
instead of spending time praying

1921
02:07:42,680 --> 02:07:45,513
l cracked 16 or more bones
2 months of complete bed rest

1922
02:07:48,880 --> 02:07:49,915
That's when l got enlightened!

1923
02:07:51,680 --> 02:07:55,150
l didn't plead to God today
to somehow ensure this job

1924
02:07:56,040 --> 02:07:58,952
lnstead l thanked Him
for blessing me with such a life

1925
02:08:00,240 --> 02:08:03,550
Sir, l won't mind
even if you reject me

1926
02:08:05,280 --> 02:08:12,356
With the limited skill and intelligence l have
l am confident l'll succeed in life, somehow

1927
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:16,549
We don't want such an upfront
employee in our company

1928
02:08:17,800 --> 02:08:20,837
We want someone who will deal
with our clients in a more diplomatic way

1929
02:08:22,640 --> 02:08:23,550
You are too straight forward

1930
02:08:28,200 --> 02:08:33,320
But if you can assure us
that you can control your attitude

1931
02:08:34,560 --> 02:08:35,754
...we may consider you

1932
02:08:37,880 --> 02:08:41,793
Only after l broke both my legs
l learnt to stand on my own 2 feet!

1933
02:08:43,080 --> 02:08:44,752
This attitude was acquired
after many bruises

1934
02:08:45,520 --> 02:08:50,469
l can't change
You keep yourjob, sir

1935
02:08:52,240 --> 02:08:56,711
l'll preserve my attitude!
Sorry, sir

1936
02:08:57,160 --> 02:08:58,036
Don't misunderstand me

1937
02:09:01,640 --> 02:09:02,595
Wait

1938
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:06,673
l've interviewed countless
people for 25 years

1939
02:09:07,680 --> 02:09:11,639
They will just nod their heads
for whatever l demand!

1940
02:09:13,240 --> 02:09:14,309
Where are you from?

1941
02:09:14,840 --> 02:09:15,272
Sir?

1942
02:09:16,720 --> 02:09:18,995
Shall we discuss
your salary package?

1943
02:09:23,960 --> 02:09:24,949
Thank you, sir

1944
02:09:54,200 --> 02:10:01,231
Boss, you are great
Bless us

1945
02:10:35,320 --> 02:10:36,389
Govindhaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!

1946
02:10:41,800 --> 02:10:46,237
Sir, you swore you'll shave off
your moustache when he gets a job

1947
02:10:46,480 --> 02:10:47,037
Sirrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!

1948
02:10:55,640 --> 02:10:56,516
What's new, dad?

1949
02:11:01,160 --> 02:11:06,553
l feel naked!
My dignity is out for a toss

1950
02:11:09,400 --> 02:11:10,628
Sevarkodi Senthil

1951
02:11:11,520 --> 02:11:12,953
l won't accept this defeat

1952
02:11:14,120 --> 02:11:17,157
You'll get yourjob
only if you pass the final exam

1953
02:11:18,440 --> 02:11:23,195
One who sets the question paper is
Virumandi Sandhanam

1954
02:11:24,280 --> 02:11:25,713
That's not fair, dad

1955
02:11:27,040 --> 02:11:29,873
Everything is fair
in love and war

1956
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:34,436
This is world war 3!

1957
02:11:37,600 --> 02:11:39,830
Senthil, you are dead meat!

1958
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:44,750
Hey mate!

1959
02:11:46,120 --> 02:11:47,348
How come at this
unearthly hour?

1960
02:11:59,720 --> 02:12:00,516
Are you drunk?

1961
02:12:00,840 --> 02:12:03,991
Gin...lady's drink

1962
02:12:04,360 --> 02:12:05,952
lt hit my head

1963
02:12:06,680 --> 02:12:07,590
Maybe a gulp too much?!

1964
02:12:08,760 --> 02:12:09,909
l can see a glimpse
of our local Juliet!

1965
02:12:10,480 --> 02:12:11,549
Yes, my dear
Roadside Romeo!!!

1966
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:14,558
All for some courage?

1967
02:12:14,880 --> 02:12:15,596
Why do you need courage?

1968
02:12:17,440 --> 02:12:19,670
To pinch this key, soul mate!

1969
02:12:20,480 --> 02:12:20,992
Key to?

1970
02:12:23,160 --> 02:12:27,358
My dad's office duplicate keyyyyy!

1971
02:12:30,880 --> 02:12:34,475
Virus has set a question paper to
topple Senthil's grades to the ground

1972
02:12:36,560 --> 02:12:39,472
lts sealed in a cover, over there

1973
02:12:40,240 --> 02:12:41,229
Lift it

1974
02:12:42,840 --> 02:12:43,795
That's cheating

1975
02:12:44,440 --> 02:12:44,917
Not fair

1976
02:12:45,680 --> 02:12:48,148
Everything is fair
in love and war

1977
02:12:52,200 --> 02:12:52,837
Hey! Roadside Romeo!

1978
02:12:53,200 --> 02:12:54,918
l need to know a fact

1979
02:12:56,480 --> 02:13:00,268
Will your nose and my nose
collide when we kiss?

1980
02:13:03,480 --> 02:13:08,270
Gimme a smoothy smooch
Lets see if our noses...ouch!

1981
02:13:15,480 --> 02:13:16,435
Got a cigarette, mate?

1982
02:13:22,120 --> 02:13:23,473
Why are you giving me a jolt?

1983
02:13:24,440 --> 02:13:24,872
Sit here

1984
02:13:26,880 --> 02:13:28,393
Hey local Juliet!
Taste mohinja

1985
02:13:28,960 --> 02:13:29,710
Mohinka?

1986
02:13:30,200 --> 02:13:32,395
lts Burmese cuisine
l love it

1987
02:13:32,920 --> 02:13:36,310
Atho...Bejo
Mohinja...Kouse

1988
02:13:39,640 --> 02:13:40,277
Hey R.R!

1989
02:13:40,880 --> 02:13:47,752
You said Burmese, but this
sounds more like Malayalam

1990
02:13:58,920 --> 02:14:03,311
Panchavan Parivendhan
What kind of name is this?

1991
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:07,117
Yuck
Not stylish at all

1992
02:14:07,880 --> 02:14:11,156
l won't use your surname
after we are married

1993
02:14:12,960 --> 02:14:14,791
-Ria
- Yeah, R.R?

1994
02:14:15,560 --> 02:14:17,915
We can't get married

1995
02:14:22,280 --> 02:14:25,955
You have a duty
left over to fulfill?

1996
02:14:32,520 --> 02:14:33,999
You love someone else?

1997
02:14:40,600 --> 02:14:42,397
Don't tell me you are gay?

1998
02:14:47,800 --> 02:14:49,358
Then why are you
not proposing to me?

1999
02:14:55,960 --> 02:14:56,710
Are you impotent?

2000
02:15:02,360 --> 02:15:05,591
Prove it
Come on

2001
02:15:07,520 --> 02:15:10,239
Provvvvvvvve it

2002
02:15:39,600 --> 02:15:42,990
ls it there, do you know?
Does her waist show?

2003
02:15:43,840 --> 02:15:46,400
lf it is so slender you can't see
then it's lleana, so slim is she!!!

2004
02:15:47,760 --> 02:15:51,196
ls it your midriff
or a shop so fancy?

2005
02:15:52,040 --> 02:15:54,554
Umbrella beyond
that waist so dainty?

2006
02:15:56,200 --> 02:15:59,636
Dude, l'm summit of fruits exotic
l am a special plate of zinc!

2007
02:16:00,080 --> 02:16:03,197
Cache of kisses your lips store
Give me one to start the score

2008
02:16:04,680 --> 02:16:07,877
Oh peahen with kaajal and turmeric
You are Kanchenjunga train, aesthetic

2009
02:16:08,360 --> 02:16:11,989
Like my 6th finger your waist so tiny
considered lucky, you are cool, baby

2010
02:16:14,440 --> 02:16:17,716
Jelly fish, so slim, ready to spin
Flower as fragrant as jasmine

2011
02:16:18,080 --> 02:16:21,709
You glisten like brass and silver
Charming you, l hold you forever

2012
02:16:22,720 --> 02:16:29,478
Caressing your cheeks l adore
l'm here to pleasure you even more

2013
02:16:31,280 --> 02:16:34,431
Jelly fish, so slim, ready to spin
Flower as fragrant as jasmine

02:16:34,800 --> 02:16:42,229
You glisten like brass and silver
Charming you, l hold you forever

2015
02:16:42,480 --> 02:16:46,268
Caressing your cheeks l adore
l'm here to pleasure you even more

2016
02:17:11,400 --> 02:17:14,312
Just once dance and shake your belly
Shake the mountains to show your valley!

2017
02:17:15,600 --> 02:17:18,592
Point the spot, show the way
Hurry burry, kill me with no delay!

2018
02:17:19,400 --> 02:17:22,870
lf still wild and not addicted
spice me with kisses unlimited

2019
02:17:23,760 --> 02:17:26,957
Spook me, sin with me, high and low
my heart heaves for you to and fro!

2020
02:17:27,400 --> 02:17:30,551
l am young,
take me...ravish me

2021
02:17:31,520 --> 02:17:35,672
Oblige me, let's
live in my lips happily

2022
02:17:43,680 --> 02:17:46,831
Jelly fish, so slim, ready to spin
Flower as fragrant as jasmine

2023
02:17:47,320 --> 02:17:50,437
You glisten like brass and silver

2024

Caressing your cheeks l adore

02:18:34,320 --> 02:18:37,596
He savored my lips wholeheartedly
Like cardamom he nibbled me tenderly

2027
02:18:38,120 --> 02:18:41,590
His kisses sweet with tender nips
embedded the sea into my lips

2028
02:18:42,600 --> 02:18:45,876
Soft like satin, ready to be feasted
Ripened perfect, fresh to be tasted

2029
02:18:47,040 --> 02:18:49,873
Did he carve or chisel this figure
Model this graceful sculpture?

2030
02:18:50,320 --> 02:18:53,676
Are you Genghis Khan the conqueror?
Only to your kisses l'll surrender?

2031
02:18:54,520 --> 02:18:58,479
Am l queen of fruits, rare as Mangusthan?
ln your arms, landlocked like Kazakisthan?

2032
02:19:07,160 --> 02:19:10,550
ls it there, do you know?
Does her waist show?

2033
02:19:11,200 --> 02:19:13,953
lf it is so slender you can't see
then it's lleana, so slim is she!!!

2034
02:19:15,080 --> 02:19:18,834
ls it your midriff
or a shop so fancy?

2035
02:19:19,560 --> 02:19:22,074
Umbrella beyond
that waist so dainty?

2036
02:19:23,680 --> 02:19:27,275
Dude, l'm summit of fruits exotic

2037
02:19:27,840 --> 02:19:30,832
Cache of kisses your lips store
Give me one to start the score

2038
02:19:32,040 --> 02:19:35,555
Oh peahen with kaajal and turmeric
You are Kanchenjunga train, aesthetic

2039
02:19:36,080 --> 02:19:39,390
Like my 6th finger your waist so tiny
considered lucky, you are cool, baby

2040
02:19:41,920 --> 02:19:46,357

02:20:00,840 --> 02:20:01,511
- Stop the car

2045
02:20:02,080 --> 02:20:02,830
- What's the matter?

2046
02:20:03,120 --> 02:20:05,156
We never told Ria
we are meeting Pari

2047
02:20:05,880 --> 02:20:08,110
Stop the car, man
My bladder is bursting

2048
02:20:08,240 --> 02:20:10,549
- Shut up, dude
- You are in contact with her?

2049
02:20:10,960 --> 02:20:13,235
No, but l know her
land line number

2050
02:20:13,520 --> 02:20:14,589
Then 1st call her

2051
02:20:19,240 --> 02:20:21,470
There's no place for
'pees-ful' offering in this country

2052
02:20:21,920 --> 02:20:22,750
Hello!! Can l talk with Ria?

2053
02:20:23,160 --> 02:20:23,478
She is not here now

2054
02:20:24,120 --> 02:20:25,030
- ls she in the hospital?

2055
02:20:25,480 --> 02:20:26,390
- No, Coimbatore

2056
02:20:26,640 --> 02:20:27,311
Coimbatore?

2057
02:20:27,680 --> 02:20:29,352
She's getting married today

2058
02:20:35,400 --> 02:20:36,276
Ria is married?

2059
02:20:37,840 --> 02:20:38,590
Not till this moment

2060
02:20:39,240 --> 02:20:39,831
lf we go full throttle

2061
02:20:40,080 --> 02:20:40,796
...we'll reach
Coimbatore in 2 hours

2062
02:20:41,200 --> 02:20:42,030
We can spoil the wedding

2063
02:20:43,840 --> 02:20:45,831
Start the car
Make an 'U' turn

2064
02:20:46,280 --> 02:20:48,635
lmpossible
Straight to Dhanushkodi

2065
02:20:48,880 --> 02:20:50,074
We have to meet Pari
and return immediately

2066
02:20:50,360 --> 02:20:52,237
l have a meeting on Friday
with Kosakski Pasupugazh

2067
02:20:52,480 --> 02:20:53,071
Get into the car

2068
02:20:53,440 --> 02:20:54,236
lf l miss that, do you
know what will happen?

2069
02:20:54,560 --> 02:20:55,515
Japanese will get him

2070
02:20:56,040 --> 02:20:56,711
They are offering him ....

2071
02:21:15,040 --> 02:21:16,075
Rakesh weds Ria

2072
02:21:17,280 --> 02:21:17,951
Thanks for the suit

2073
02:21:21,440 --> 02:21:22,316
Virus will have a heart attack

2074
02:21:22,880 --> 02:21:24,871
We somehow create a ruckus
in both his daughters' weddings!

2075
02:21:25,600 --> 02:21:26,794
l'll exorcise, Ria

2076
02:21:27,240 --> 02:21:28,116
You rip off Mr Price tag

2077
02:21:37,480 --> 02:21:37,992
Venkat?!

2078
02:21:39,120 --> 02:21:39,950
We found Pari, Ria

2079
02:21:46,080 --> 02:21:47,479
- Sir?
- That's the groom?

2080
02:21:48,040 --> 02:21:49,393
How long will you take
to get an iron?

2081
02:21:49,640 --> 02:21:51,392
-Sorry, sir
-Give it to me, escape

2082
02:21:54,040 --> 02:21:55,678
Please give this inside, bro

2083
02:21:55,920 --> 02:21:57,035
Give the flowers to the bride

2084
02:21:57,560 --> 02:21:58,788
This is for the groom
to wear on the dais

2085
02:21:59,000 --> 02:22:00,831
lt is our custom

2086
02:22:01,120 --> 02:22:02,109
ls that so?

2087
02:22:02,520 --> 02:22:03,350
Hey mambo

2088
02:22:07,480 --> 02:22:07,912
Good morning, sir

2089
02:22:08,400 --> 02:22:09,469
Quick! lron my
sherwani, man

2090
02:22:10,200 --> 02:22:10,996
Hey mambo

2091
02:22:11,640 --> 02:22:13,870
l'm telling you we've found Pari
and you still want to marry that donkey

2092
02:22:14,520 --> 02:22:15,635
Are you insane, Venkat?

2093
02:22:15,920 --> 02:22:16,955
Don't fool yourself, Ria

2094
02:22:17,440 --> 02:22:18,077
You haven't forgotten
Pari even now

2095
02:22:18,520 --> 02:22:20,556
That's why you still eat
his favorite mohinja and kouse

2096
02:22:35,520 --> 02:22:36,157
That Rakesh?

2097
02:22:36,760 --> 02:22:38,113
How can a villain
ever turn a hero?

2098
02:22:38,560 --> 02:22:40,516
He'll tie around your neck, not the sacred
marriage thread but only price tag!

2099
02:22:41,000 --> 02:22:41,432
Shut up, Venkat

2100
02:22:42,200 --> 02:22:43,076
He has changed completely now

2101
02:22:43,720 --> 02:22:45,472
He doesn't talk about
brands or price these days

2102
02:22:45,720 --> 02:22:48,393
My 2 lakh worth
Rohit Bal sherwani!

2103
02:22:50,520 --> 02:22:51,475
Why the hell do you
guys eat chutney?!

2104
02:22:51,680 --> 02:22:52,590
lts your chutney, sir!

2105
02:22:52,800 --> 02:22:54,756
l'm late
What will l do for my dress?

2106
02:22:55,200 --> 02:22:55,837
Sorry, sir

2107
02:22:56,160 --> 02:22:56,751
Give me 2 minutes, sir

2108
02:22:57,160 --> 02:22:58,354
l'll clean it immediately
and be back in a jiffy

2109
02:22:58,800 --> 02:23:00,518
Go, man
Get it soon

2110
02:23:01,720 --> 02:23:03,119
Who the hell
invented chutney!?!

2111
02:23:03,760 --> 02:23:06,399
Ria, its late
Come out soon

2112
02:23:06,720 --> 02:23:08,312
Aunt, you look gorgeous!

2113
02:23:22,040 --> 02:23:23,473
Ria, l'm Senthil

2114
02:23:24,440 --> 02:23:26,874
Please don't create a big scene
They will chop me to pieces

2115
02:23:30,680 --> 02:23:31,192
Where is Rakesh?

2116
02:23:31,720 --> 02:23:33,039
What happened to
my sherwani, man?

2117
02:23:33,320 --> 02:23:34,833
Your house-keeping boy
took it with him

2118
02:23:35,080 --> 02:23:36,115
Chutney sherwani

2119
02:23:36,600 --> 02:23:37,476
Things have gone
beyond our control

2120
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:39,319
Go and ask
Rakesh to come

2121
02:23:40,200 --> 02:23:43,431
lf l go now they'll say
groom didn't like the bride

2122
02:23:50,560 --> 02:23:53,120
Senthil, right time for you both
to make your exit

2123
02:23:53,560 --> 02:23:54,390
Car is ready and waiting for you
Bring Ria

2124
02:23:55,880 --> 02:23:57,233
Hey! Just shut up
Don't shout

2125
02:23:57,480 --> 02:23:57,992
Sherwani

2126
02:23:58,320 --> 02:24:01,039
How come you are here, sir?
Who is on the dais then?

2127
02:24:01,440 --> 02:24:02,236
On the dais?

2128
02:24:08,440 --> 02:24:10,192
One more round
and we'll be married

2129
02:24:10,840 --> 02:24:12,159
l'm already a married man!

2130
02:24:12,760 --> 02:24:13,317
Let's leave

2131
02:24:13,640 --> 02:24:14,390
So will my dignity and respect

2132
02:24:15,120 --> 02:24:16,109
l'll be ridiculed by all

2133
02:24:17,440 --> 02:24:19,635
So you will spoil your life, huh?

2134
02:24:20,480 --> 02:24:20,992
Sevarkodi?

2135
02:24:21,160 --> 02:24:22,513
They'll gossip for max 1 week

2136
02:24:22,800 --> 02:24:23,835
After that?
They'll forget

2137
02:24:24,720 --> 02:24:25,311
Dad

2138
02:24:25,600 --> 02:24:30,390
lf you deny this out of fear
you'll regret your inaction till you die

2139
02:24:32,080 --> 02:24:35,629
Everyone in their lives
will arrive at a crossroad

2140
02:24:37,120 --> 02:24:38,030
One side points to

2141
02:24:40,120 --> 02:24:40,711
Housekeeping

2142
02:24:41,040 --> 02:24:42,268
Rakesh
Mr Price tag

2143
02:24:42,640 --> 02:24:43,709
'Your fate that's sealed' life

2144
02:24:44,320 --> 02:24:46,436
The other side leads to
Pari...love

2145
02:24:46,840 --> 02:24:47,795
The life you desired and dreamt

2146
02:24:49,760 --> 02:24:51,591
This is the moment
that's the turning point in your life

2147
02:24:52,480 --> 02:24:53,708
Make up your mind

2148
02:25:21,440 --> 02:25:22,350
Hurry up

2149
02:25:23,920 --> 02:25:26,036
Go...go...go...go...go

2150
02:25:44,800 --> 02:25:46,552
Ria, l have a doubt
-What?

2151
02:25:46,960 --> 02:25:49,428
What if Pari is married?
-Whaat?

2152
02:25:49,880 --> 02:25:51,074
He wouldn't have got married, Ria

2153
02:25:51,400 --> 02:25:51,752
lf he has?

2154
02:25:51,920 --> 02:25:52,670
We'll bring you back here?!

2155
02:25:53,520 --> 02:25:54,157
Cool...cool...cool

2156
02:25:54,360 --> 02:25:54,951
Try these biscuits

2157
02:25:55,280 --> 02:25:56,793
Hand made
Made in San Francisco

2158
02:26:00,200 --> 02:26:00,757
What's he doing here?

2159
02:26:01,560 --> 02:26:02,675
Fuelling the car
with his gas!

2160
02:26:03,880 --> 02:26:05,518
Taste this biscuit
lts really yummy

2161
02:26:09,040 --> 02:26:10,393
All is well
All is well

2162
02:26:12,080 --> 02:26:13,718
Till yesterday
l was a decent chap

2163
02:26:14,520 --> 02:26:17,193
ln this past 24 hours l created a scene
and forced a plane to land

2164
02:26:17,960 --> 02:26:20,190
lnstead of Kasi i tried to
dissolve the holy ashes in the loo

2165
02:26:20,800 --> 02:26:21,994
l kidnapped a bride

2166
02:26:22,560 --> 02:26:24,357
All of this for that idiot Pari

2167
02:26:27,840 --> 02:26:29,717
Pari too will go
that extra mile for his friends

2168
02:26:35,680 --> 02:26:37,352
Check where the red seal cover is

2169
02:26:39,240 --> 02:26:41,549
Pari was worried Senthil
might replay his suicide attempt

2170
02:26:41,800 --> 02:26:43,074
...if he didn't do well in his exams

2171
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:46,434
We went to Virus's office
to steal the question paper for him

2172
02:26:47,200 --> 02:26:48,394
We vowed not to
see the question paper

2173
02:26:49,160 --> 02:26:51,754
Such was our rightful thought
even in a wrong doing!!

2174
02:26:55,720 --> 02:26:57,711
Where has that darn man
hidden that damn paper?

2175
02:26:58,520 --> 02:26:59,430
Looks like dawn will break
before we lay our hands on it

2176
02:27:00,920 --> 02:27:01,989
Why don't you ask Ria?

2177
02:27:09,520 --> 02:27:11,397
l got finger cramps
dialing your # !?

2178
02:27:11,640 --> 02:27:12,197
Give me the phone

2179
02:27:12,440 --> 02:27:14,431
Hello dear brother-in-law
- Ria, you got a call

2180
02:27:14,880 --> 02:27:16,552
lf we say all is well
the baby kicks

2181
02:27:17,880 --> 02:27:19,359
Riaaaa...phone

2182
02:27:20,920 --> 02:27:22,478
l'll repeat all is well again

2183
02:27:23,000 --> 02:27:25,309
All...is...well!!

2184
02:27:27,120 --> 02:27:28,951
Pari, l found it

2185
02:27:31,040 --> 02:27:32,155
HellOoooo

2186
02:28:30,560 --> 02:28:31,515
Where are you coming from?

2187
02:28:34,600 --> 02:28:35,112
This is for you

2188
02:28:36,960 --> 02:28:37,358
What is this?

2189
02:28:38,120 --> 02:28:38,757
Question paper

2190
02:28:40,600 --> 02:28:42,556
Virus set this himself
to ensure you fail!

2191
02:28:48,760 --> 02:28:49,909
World's best friends
That's what you both are

2192
02:28:52,280 --> 02:28:53,872
1st you showed me
how to win the right way

2193
02:28:55,000 --> 02:28:56,228
Now you are showing me a wrong path

2194
02:28:59,320 --> 02:28:59,957
No need, buddy

2195
02:29:02,120 --> 02:29:02,996
l'll write what l know

2196
02:29:04,080 --> 02:29:05,308
Doesn't matter if l fail

2197
02:29:19,520 --> 02:29:19,918
Super trouper!

2198
02:29:20,800 --> 02:29:21,949
Senthil rose in our estimation

2199
02:29:22,520 --> 02:29:24,112
l wouldn't have minded
becoming his brother-in-law

2200
02:29:25,400 --> 02:29:26,549
l thought of
his sister Jaya

2201
02:29:32,800 --> 02:29:33,516
l controlled
my impulsive whim!

2202
02:29:38,320 --> 02:29:38,911
Sir?

2203
02:29:47,080 --> 02:29:47,956
You dirty mongrels!

2204
02:29:49,200 --> 02:29:49,598
Don't, sir

2205
02:29:50,080 --> 02:29:51,149
Will you change the system?

2206
02:29:54,080 --> 02:29:55,957
Will you pee in front of my house?

2207
02:29:57,400 --> 02:29:57,991
Please, sir

2208
02:29:59,520 --> 02:30:00,191
We are sorry, sir

2209
02:30:00,360 --> 02:30:01,076
You are rusticated

2210
02:30:02,320 --> 02:30:03,355
Leave the campus immediately

2211
02:30:04,560 --> 02:30:06,437
lf you don't leave by day break
l will call the police

2212
02:30:08,320 --> 02:30:09,275
Get out you rascals!

2213
02:30:11,040 --> 02:30:12,359
Rascals! All of you are rascals!!!

2214
02:30:20,640 --> 02:30:22,232
How did those scoundrels
get my office room key?

2215
02:30:23,640 --> 02:30:24,356
l was the one
who gave them , dad

2216
02:30:26,440 --> 02:30:30,479
lf l had given this key that day
to my bro, he'd be alive today

2217
02:30:30,920 --> 02:30:32,069
Ria...shut up

2218
02:30:33,840 --> 02:30:35,717
Did your son fall accidentally
from the train and die?

2219
02:30:37,000 --> 02:30:37,591
Shut up, Ria

2220
02:30:40,240 --> 02:30:42,196
You decided he should
be an engineer, dad

2221
02:30:43,240 --> 02:30:46,391
Did you ever ask him
what his dream was?

2222
02:30:48,120 --> 02:30:51,999
You pressurized him
to get 298.5 / 300

2223
02:30:52,840 --> 02:30:57,231
He chose to die instead of
writing the entrance exam

2224
02:31:01,000 --> 02:31:01,830
What is she saying?

2225
02:31:02,120 --> 02:31:02,950
She is blabbering, dad

2226
02:31:03,200 --> 02:31:05,430
l'll get your tablets
You go to your room, dad

2227
02:31:09,440 --> 02:31:10,509
Ria, what are you doing?

2228
02:31:11,640 --> 02:31:13,153
He wanted to study literature

2229
02:31:14,400 --> 02:31:18,279
To become a poet
was his dream

2230
02:31:19,720 --> 02:31:22,518
His last poem
was this suicide note, dad

2231
02:31:24,440 --> 02:31:25,919
Ria, will you keep quiet?

2232
02:31:26,440 --> 02:31:27,873
How long do you
want me to be silent, sis?

2233
02:31:29,040 --> 02:31:30,996
Once...atleast once

2234
02:31:31,640 --> 02:31:32,550
did you tell him
...that he could discontinue

2235
02:31:32,920 --> 02:31:36,390
if he didn't like engineering
...and follow his heart

2236
02:31:37,760 --> 02:31:39,113
He'd be alive today, dad

2237
02:31:40,920 --> 02:31:41,830
He'd be with us, now

2238
02:31:47,280 --> 02:31:48,110
He didn't commit suicide

2239
02:31:48,960 --> 02:31:54,478
Yes dad, it wasn't suicide
lt was murder

2240
02:32:10,160 --> 02:32:14,119
ln the continuous downpour
most roads in Chennai are flooded

2241
02:32:24,760 --> 02:32:25,556
Daaad?!

2242
02:32:27,280 --> 02:32:27,757
Shwetha?!

2243
02:32:29,960 --> 02:32:31,916
Millimeter, why are you
following me?

2244
02:32:32,280 --> 02:32:32,712
Go and study

2245
02:32:32,960 --> 02:32:34,439
l am following my heart
ls that wrong?

2246
02:32:35,120 --> 02:32:38,317
Please help
lt is an emergency here

2247
02:32:39,000 --> 02:32:40,319
Hey! What the hell?

2248
02:32:40,800 --> 02:32:42,438
ls there only
1 ambulance in this city?

2249
02:32:42,960 --> 02:32:46,111
Sir, what can l do?
Whole city is flooded

2250
02:32:46,720 --> 02:32:48,358
Don't know what to do
in this rain, Ria

2251
02:32:48,840 --> 02:32:49,511
l can't bear the pain

2252
02:32:49,920 --> 02:32:51,069
Hey! Shwetha!
What happened?

2253
02:32:51,160 --> 02:32:51,672
Pari?

2254
02:32:52,040 --> 02:32:53,075
Here...talk to Ria

2255
02:32:53,840 --> 02:32:57,230
ln the state she is in now, we can't
risk bringing Shwetha to the hospital

2256
02:32:57,560 --> 02:32:58,595
Listen to me

2257
02:32:59,080 --> 02:33:00,559
Aiyo! How do l make
you understand?

2258
02:33:01,040 --> 02:33:02,109
Her waterbag broke

2259
02:33:03,040 --> 02:33:04,359
Oi! Hello

2260
02:33:05,800 --> 02:33:07,756
Shwetha?!
Shwetha??

2261
02:33:12,120 --> 02:33:13,348
We are taking her
to the P.T hall, Ria

2262
02:33:15,800 --> 02:33:16,516
Switch on the light

2263
02:33:16,960 --> 02:33:18,837
- Where?
- Table tennis

2264
02:33:21,040 --> 02:33:22,155
Ria, we are in the P.T hall

2265
02:33:22,720 --> 02:33:23,914
Switch on the webcam

2266
02:33:31,360 --> 02:33:33,555
You'll be fine, sis

2267
02:33:34,320 --> 02:33:36,231
Ria, this pain is unbearable

2268
02:33:36,920 --> 02:33:38,273
Pari, we have no other option

2269
02:33:38,880 --> 02:33:41,997
So many babies have been delivered
when doctors and hospitals didn't even exist!

2270
02:33:43,560 --> 02:33:45,232
My sister's baby
will be safely delivered

2271
02:33:45,880 --> 02:33:46,471
...by you!

2272
02:33:50,800 --> 02:33:52,995
All is well
All is well

2273
02:33:53,560 --> 02:33:56,028
How dare you!
l'll murder all of you

2274
02:33:56,280 --> 02:33:59,352
Dad, please
Don't interfere in this

2275
02:34:02,040 --> 02:34:03,393
Venkat, get me towels
and a pair of scissors

2276
02:34:03,720 --> 02:34:06,678
Millimeter, bring clothes peg
and boiling hot water

2277
02:34:07,800 --> 02:34:09,950
Pari, cover Shwetha
with some sheet

2278
02:34:13,600 --> 02:34:14,476
Sis, push

2279
02:34:15,120 --> 02:34:15,757
Push...push

2280
02:34:17,560 --> 02:34:18,151
Come on, Shwetha

2281
02:34:18,440 --> 02:34:19,111
Grit your teeth and push

2282
02:34:21,160 --> 02:34:22,229
What do you mean
push...push?

2283
02:34:22,520 --> 02:34:22,952
l am not able to

2284
02:34:23,160 --> 02:34:25,799
Check if it is crowning

2285
02:34:26,200 --> 02:34:27,428
Crowning means?

2286
02:34:28,160 --> 02:34:29,991
See if the baby's head
is coming out

2287
02:34:32,320 --> 02:34:32,911
Come on, quick

2288
02:34:33,800 --> 02:34:34,596
GO!

2289
02:34:45,040 --> 02:34:47,190
No, it isn't crowning as yet

2290
02:34:48,120 --> 02:34:49,235
Shwetha...come on...push

2291
02:35:00,080 --> 02:35:01,638
She's exhausted, Ria

2292
02:35:02,880 --> 02:35:03,278
Shwetha!

2293
02:35:03,880 --> 02:35:04,551
Wake her up, dad

2294
02:35:05,160 --> 02:35:06,639
Otherwise it will lead
to complications

2295
02:35:07,200 --> 02:35:08,189
Shwetha

2296
02:35:09,160 --> 02:35:10,798
Looks like they will
need a vacuum pump

2297
02:35:11,160 --> 02:35:12,309
Where will they go
for a vacuum cup?

2298
02:35:13,920 --> 02:35:16,195
Vacuum cup?
How will that help?

2299
02:35:16,480 --> 02:35:16,878
Tell me

2300
02:35:17,360 --> 02:35:17,917
l'll show you

2301
02:35:19,240 --> 02:35:23,279
When the mother can't push the baby
a vacuum cup is inserted inside

2302
02:35:23,960 --> 02:35:29,193
lt will grip the baby's head tight
and help ease the baby out

2303
02:35:30,440 --> 02:35:31,236
l can do this

2304
02:35:32,280 --> 02:35:32,678
How?

2305
02:35:33,000 --> 02:35:33,750
Vacuum cleaner, sir

2306
02:35:34,760 --> 02:35:36,591
Pressure will be too high
in a vacuum cleaner, Pari

2307
02:35:36,880 --> 02:35:37,949
l can control the pressure

2308
02:35:38,320 --> 02:35:39,389
Can you get a vacuum cleaner?

2309
02:35:39,680 --> 02:35:40,715
There's 1 in my office

2310
02:35:41,360 --> 02:35:42,839
Venkat, you go
and get it right away

2311
02:35:43,280 --> 02:35:44,156
- Here's the key!
- Here's the key!!

2312
02:35:49,880 --> 02:35:51,393
Shwetha
Push...push

2313
02:35:55,400 --> 02:35:55,752
What happened?

2314
02:35:56,600 --> 02:35:57,919
What happened?
-l don't know

2315
02:36:02,560 --> 02:36:03,595
Ria.
-What happened?

2316
02:36:04,080 --> 02:36:04,592
No electricity

2317
02:36:05,320 --> 02:36:06,594
How will the vacuum cleaner work then?

2318
02:36:08,400 --> 02:36:11,358
Venkat, you get the vacuum cleaner
l'll make arrangements for electricity

2319
02:36:11,680 --> 02:36:11,998
How?

2320
02:36:12,720 --> 02:36:15,075
Millimeter, take Virus out
Quick

2321
02:36:15,320 --> 02:36:15,877
Sir, go out

2322
02:36:16,200 --> 02:36:16,837
Go out, sir

2323
02:36:18,240 --> 02:36:19,559
You molecule!
Behave yourself

2324
02:36:23,360 --> 02:36:25,555
Not this Virus!
Virus inverter that l invented!!

2325
02:36:26,200 --> 02:36:26,791
Go and get it fast

2326
02:36:27,600 --> 02:36:28,077
Sorry sir

2327
02:36:29,200 --> 02:36:30,792
Senthil, wake up
all the boys in the hostel

2328
02:36:31,240 --> 02:36:32,275
Get all the car batteries
you can lay your hands on

2329
02:36:33,800 --> 02:36:35,074
Don't forget the pressure gauge

2330
02:36:37,800 --> 02:36:38,471
Hey! Emergency

2331
02:36:39,040 --> 02:36:40,359
All of you come
to P.T hall immediately

2332
02:37:05,840 --> 02:37:06,272
Where is Pari?

2333
02:37:06,920 --> 02:37:08,478
l am here, sir

2334
02:37:13,360 --> 02:37:15,237
Senthil, switch everything off

2335
02:37:15,480 --> 02:37:16,515
Connect inverter
to the main board

2336
02:37:19,680 --> 02:37:20,635
Pari, vacuum cleaner

2337
02:37:21,800 --> 02:37:24,872
Venkat, bring the lens cleaner
that you use for your camera

2338
02:37:25,400 --> 02:37:26,879
You mean blower?
-Yeah...yeah

2339
02:37:27,960 --> 02:37:28,790
- Pari, blower

2340
02:37:30,680 --> 02:37:32,955
Fit this pressure gauge
in the vacuum cleaner's pipe

2341
02:37:58,080 --> 02:37:59,354
Pari, we are ready

2342
02:38:00,040 --> 02:38:00,836
Make sure switches are off

2343
02:38:03,160 --> 02:38:05,594
Switch on only
table-tennis lights and computer line

2344
02:38:13,160 --> 02:38:14,957
Heyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
Hurraaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay!

2345
02:38:15,920 --> 02:38:17,035
Senthil, switch on the computer

2346
02:38:22,320 --> 02:38:23,514
Love you, Pari

2347
02:38:24,200 --> 02:38:26,395
Venkat, switch it on

2348
02:38:33,920 --> 02:38:35,478
Ria, how much should
suction force be?

2349
02:38:35,680 --> 02:38:36,874
Not more than 0.5

2350
02:38:37,040 --> 02:38:37,916
Venkat, 0.5

2351
02:38:38,560 --> 02:38:38,958
Close it

2352
02:38:45,040 --> 02:38:46,314
Venkat, switch it off

2353
02:38:52,520 --> 02:38:53,873
Senthil, go near the table

2354
02:38:56,040 --> 02:38:58,600
Look at me, same way
push the baby down

2355
02:38:59,400 --> 02:39:00,150
Like this

2356
02:39:02,120 --> 02:39:03,519
Venkat, switch it on

2357
02:39:03,840 --> 02:39:05,319
Okay...on

2358
02:39:06,160 --> 02:39:07,229
Come on
Shwetha...push

2359
02:39:10,160 --> 02:39:10,956
Shwetha...push

2360
02:39:11,240 --> 02:39:12,639
Otherwise the baby is in danger

2361
02:39:16,480 --> 02:39:17,549
Baby's head is seen

2362
02:39:20,560 --> 02:39:21,549
Shwetha, push

2363
02:39:23,200 --> 02:39:23,916
Push...Shwetha...push

2364
02:39:39,400 --> 02:39:40,674
Venkat, off

2365
02:40:06,840 --> 02:40:08,478
Fix 2 clamps and
cut the umbilical cord

2366
02:40:09,240 --> 02:40:10,719
Venkat, clip it

2367
02:40:11,160 --> 02:40:11,876
Give me the scissors

2368
02:40:13,760 --> 02:40:14,556
Careful

2369
02:40:16,840 --> 02:40:17,955
Right in the centre

2370
02:40:22,680 --> 02:40:24,989
Ria, why is the baby not crying?

2371
02:40:30,720 --> 02:40:33,996
Champ!
Look at me

2372
02:40:34,320 --> 02:40:36,436
Pari, rub the baby's back

2373
02:40:41,880 --> 02:40:43,552
No, he isn't moving

2374
02:40:44,040 --> 02:40:45,473
Blow into the baby's mouth

2375
02:40:52,800 --> 02:40:53,357
Come on, champ

2376
02:40:55,600 --> 02:40:57,158
No movement at all, Ria

2377
02:41:02,680 --> 02:41:03,112
Oh God!

2378
02:41:05,440 --> 02:41:05,997
Ria..

2379
02:41:21,800 --> 02:41:22,710
Don't cry, Shwetha

2380
02:41:23,240 --> 02:41:23,956
Say 'all is well'

2381
02:41:30,640 --> 02:41:31,993
He kicked!

2382
02:41:34,360 --> 02:41:37,352
What?
-The baby kicked

2383
02:41:42,520 --> 02:41:43,589
All is well
Say 'all is well'

2384
02:41:54,600 --> 02:41:55,316
All is well

2385
02:42:43,680 --> 02:42:45,636
lf Virus only said, 'l want my
grandson to be an engineer'

2386
02:42:45,920 --> 02:42:47,558
...l intended to knock him down
with 1 solid kick to his intestines!

2387
02:42:48,400 --> 02:42:50,914
But Virus stunned us instead

2388
02:42:52,680 --> 02:42:53,476
Look at how he's kicking

2389
02:42:54,560 --> 02:42:55,788
Will you become a football player?

2390
02:42:56,760 --> 02:43:02,153
Follow your heart, my precious

2391
02:43:22,840 --> 02:43:23,272
Wait

2392
02:43:24,280 --> 02:43:24,871
Where are you off to?

2393
02:43:25,720 --> 02:43:26,630
l'm not finished with you

2394
02:43:27,800 --> 02:43:29,836
Do you remember that you asked me
a question on your 1st day of college?

2395
02:43:30,960 --> 02:43:32,712
Why a pencil cannot
be used in space?

2396
02:43:34,280 --> 02:43:36,953
lf the pencil's hook broke
due to zero gravity

2397
02:43:37,200 --> 02:43:38,076
...it will be orbiting there

2398
02:43:39,160 --> 02:43:40,957
There are chances of it poking
someone's eye or nose

2399
02:43:41,440 --> 02:43:44,477
...or it could damage any instrument

2400
02:43:45,040 --> 02:43:45,552
Do you know that?

2401
02:43:45,960 --> 02:43:46,676
You were wrong

2402
02:43:48,560 --> 02:43:51,950
You cannot be right all the time
Understand?

2403
02:43:53,840 --> 02:43:54,477
Yes, sir

2404
02:43:58,000 --> 02:43:59,592
This is an important invention

2405
02:44:00,760 --> 02:44:01,192
Understand?

2406
02:44:02,600 --> 02:44:02,998
Yes, sir

2407
02:44:03,600 --> 02:44:07,513
My director told me, 'when you see
an extraordinary student

2408
02:44:09,360 --> 02:44:11,237
...give this to him'

2409
02:44:23,320 --> 02:44:25,276
Go and study

2410
02:44:27,480 --> 02:44:29,948
After you pass your exams
go wherever you want to

2411
02:45:13,240 --> 02:45:15,595
Sir, 1 photo please

2412
02:45:37,680 --> 02:45:38,635
l clicked snaps

2413
02:45:39,160 --> 02:45:40,718
... for those precious moments
to always be in my casket of memories!

2414
02:45:42,920 --> 02:45:43,591
So emotionally charged

2415
02:45:44,160 --> 02:45:45,036
Whichever way we turned

2416
02:45:45,440 --> 02:45:47,192
...laughter, screams ofjoy,
woeful faces, tear-filled eyes,

2417
02:45:48,920 --> 02:45:49,875
needles in all our hearts
for parting from our friends

2418
02:45:50,720 --> 02:45:53,154
We planned to meet
at least once a year

2419
02:45:59,960 --> 02:46:02,918
l never thought that would be
the last time l'd see Pari

2420
02:47:00,000 --> 02:47:00,512
Senthil

2421
02:47:15,520 --> 02:47:16,999
Only Pari can run a school like this

2422
02:47:19,120 --> 02:47:19,518
Where is Pari?

2423
02:47:20,320 --> 02:47:22,550
There's a wine shop in every
street corner but can't find a toilet

2424
02:47:27,320 --> 02:47:28,469
Smile please

2425
02:47:28,680 --> 02:47:29,795
You can't click snaps of all this

2426
02:47:30,080 --> 02:47:31,115
Go away, kiddos

2427
02:47:31,560 --> 02:47:34,074
Sir, this is a wall
Not a rest room

2428
02:47:34,560 --> 02:47:36,630
lf l get there
l'll smash you 2

2429
02:47:37,120 --> 02:47:37,597
Get off

2430
02:47:54,720 --> 02:47:56,870
All this is Pari's antics
He's somewhere close by

2431
02:47:57,200 --> 02:47:57,632
Come

2432
02:48:02,480 --> 02:48:03,469
Excuse me, sir

2433
02:48:03,880 --> 02:48:05,791
Do you know where
Panchavan Parivendhan is?

2434
02:48:06,360 --> 02:48:07,236
Handsome guy

2435
02:48:07,840 --> 02:48:09,592
He'll forever be
repeating 'all is well'

2436
02:48:09,840 --> 02:48:11,353
They used to call him Pappu
when he was young

2437
02:48:11,800 --> 02:48:13,233
Cool...cool
Come with me

2438
02:48:15,040 --> 02:48:15,995
Bro, where's Pari?

2439
02:48:19,480 --> 02:48:20,595
Venkat sir, look at these

2440
02:48:20,840 --> 02:48:22,319
He'll never miss
any book of yours

2441
02:48:27,240 --> 02:48:28,753
Senthil sir, take a look

2442
02:48:29,320 --> 02:48:30,753
He checks your blog daily

2443
02:48:31,040 --> 02:48:32,837
He'll talk about your research
with such pride to the kids here

2444
02:48:38,800 --> 02:48:39,676
Do you remember this helmet?

2445
02:48:40,200 --> 02:48:41,553
Yours?
Got stolen, right?

2446
02:48:45,200 --> 02:48:47,760
Who are you?
How do you know our names?

2447
02:48:48,280 --> 02:48:49,030
You still can't recognize me?

2448
02:48:51,080 --> 02:48:53,196
Millimeter has become centimeter now!

2449
02:48:54,960 --> 02:48:55,790
Millimeter!?!

2450
02:49:00,040 --> 02:49:00,711
Oi! Millimeter

2451
02:49:05,000 --> 02:49:06,513
How did you cross
this many kilometers?

2452
02:49:06,800 --> 02:49:08,472
One day, l got a letter
with a train ticket

2453
02:49:08,880 --> 02:49:10,438
Do you want to go to school?
Jump into this train

2454
02:49:10,640 --> 02:49:11,117
l did just that!

2455
02:49:12,280 --> 02:49:13,918
He updated us with his flashback
as short and sweet as a ThirukkuraL

2456
02:49:14,560 --> 02:49:15,356
Our Parianandha is pure gold!

2457
02:49:17,280 --> 02:49:17,917
Where is that incorrigible idiot?!

2458
02:49:28,200 --> 02:49:30,350
Atlee, operate this

2459
02:49:38,720 --> 02:49:41,393
You come in my dream
daily in that same scooter

2460
02:49:42,440 --> 02:49:43,589
...as my bride dressed in
your wedding finery

2461
02:49:45,400 --> 02:49:48,517
You remove your helmet
and come close to kiss me

2462
02:49:49,560 --> 02:49:50,834
Awwww...ouch!

2463
02:49:51,600 --> 02:49:53,192
At least you could have said
bye to me before you left

2464
02:49:57,760 --> 02:49:58,351
Sorry

2465
02:50:00,800 --> 02:50:01,516
Are you married?

2466
02:50:02,200 --> 02:50:03,076
Marriage...?

2467
02:50:05,200 --> 02:50:05,791
Not yet

2468
02:50:06,640 --> 02:50:07,231
You?

2469
02:50:07,800 --> 02:50:08,357
More or less!!!

2470
02:50:09,160 --> 02:50:09,910
lncorrigible idiot?!

2471
02:50:13,960 --> 02:50:14,312
Then?

2472
02:50:15,800 --> 02:50:16,357
Then?

2473
02:50:17,600 --> 02:50:18,077
What else?

2474
02:50:19,880 --> 02:50:20,835
What...

2475
02:50:24,680 --> 02:50:25,749
Are you in love with someone?

2476
02:50:30,680 --> 02:50:31,112
Yes

2477
02:50:35,120 --> 02:50:35,632
Who?

2478
02:50:38,960 --> 02:50:39,676
Local Juliet!!!

2479
02:50:49,320 --> 02:50:51,151
Our noses didn't collide!

2480
02:50:52,440 --> 02:50:54,078
Yeah! That's right

2481
02:50:55,120 --> 02:50:55,757
Hey! Pari?

2482
02:50:58,120 --> 02:50:59,553
Hai Venkat!

2483
02:51:00,360 --> 02:51:02,828
Yeah now l'm crappy Venkat!
l'll slipper you to shreds

2484
02:51:03,880 --> 02:51:04,312
l can explain

2485
02:51:05,440 --> 02:51:05,917
Don't bother

2486
02:51:06,920 --> 02:51:07,670
Senthil?

2487
02:51:11,400 --> 02:51:11,957
Catch him

2488
02:51:15,160 --> 02:51:16,195
Listen to me

2489
02:51:18,760 --> 02:51:19,476
Where all we hunted for you

2490
02:51:20,200 --> 02:51:21,030
Couldn't you make one single call?!

2491
02:51:22,360 --> 02:51:23,952
Did you come
all this way to thrash me?!

2492
02:51:24,280 --> 02:51:26,271
4 blows on my behalf

2493
02:52:02,800 --> 02:52:05,109
Hey losers?
Having fun, huh?

2494
02:52:06,040 --> 02:52:08,156
Hey! Silencer?

2495
02:52:08,440 --> 02:52:10,271
Panchavan Paaarivendhan

2496
02:52:10,520 --> 02:52:13,557
Greetings, school master
Such a big shot you are

2497
02:52:14,240 --> 02:52:16,117
Village school teacher

2498
02:52:16,640 --> 02:52:19,552
A for apple
B for ball, it seems

2499
02:52:21,640 --> 02:52:23,870
We boarded the same train, same day

2500
02:52:24,360 --> 02:52:26,715
But your train went in reverse

2501
02:52:28,000 --> 02:52:30,116
Engineer to school teacher

2502
02:52:31,560 --> 02:52:33,949
How much is your salary, Pari?
Rs 5000?

2503
02:52:34,640 --> 02:52:35,755
That's just $100

2504
02:52:36,320 --> 02:52:39,676
My son's pocket money is much more
than what you earn in a month

2505
02:52:40,440 --> 02:52:42,192
Don't be drama king
Stop it

2506
02:52:42,640 --> 02:52:44,039
He is the one who over (re)acted!

2507
02:52:44,600 --> 02:52:48,479
''l'll change the educational system
l'll change the world'' he claimed

2508
02:52:49,000 --> 02:52:52,993
Now he's busy baby sitting
A glorified nanny!!

2509
02:52:53,640 --> 02:52:55,278
Will you manhandle this
low grade fellow or shall l?

2510
02:52:55,520 --> 02:52:56,111
Relax!

2511
02:52:56,320 --> 02:52:58,356
Didn't l tell you a decade ago

2512
02:52:58,760 --> 02:53:01,433
...that you'll all cry
and l'll have the last laugh!?

2513
02:53:06,920 --> 02:53:08,069
Sign here

2514
02:53:09,680 --> 02:53:12,752
Accept you lost
and that l won

2515
02:53:13,120 --> 02:53:14,951
Declaration of defeat

2516
02:53:15,760 --> 02:53:18,069
Oi! He's come
with an agreement

2517
02:53:19,640 --> 02:53:21,995
Hey! This is Virus's pen
How did you get it?

2518
02:53:22,320 --> 02:53:23,116
Pinched it?

2519
02:53:26,200 --> 02:53:28,236
This is for winners
Not for losers

2520
02:53:29,920 --> 02:53:33,117
Don't feel bad that
you lost our bet

2521
02:53:33,440 --> 02:53:36,318
lf ever you need
donation for your school

2522
02:53:36,880 --> 02:53:38,518
...don't hesitate
to call my assistant

2523
02:53:38,880 --> 02:53:39,312
Catch it

2524
02:53:40,120 --> 02:53:40,677
Funny guys!

2525
02:53:41,520 --> 02:53:43,829
A for apple
B for ball

2526
02:53:47,040 --> 02:53:48,029
He hasn't changed one bit

2527
02:53:48,440 --> 02:53:49,668
Just ignore that low grade fellow

2528
02:53:50,880 --> 02:53:55,237
l am so relieved your name is not
Panchavan Parivendhan

2529
02:53:55,960 --> 02:53:59,032
After we get married, imagine
if l am called Mrs Parivendhan!

2530
02:54:01,480 --> 02:54:03,311
What's your real name?

02:54:04,800 --> 02:54:05,710
Kosaksi Pasapugazh

2532
02:54:06,600 --> 02:54:07,157

You have 400 patents?
-Yes

2536
02:54:17,440 --> 02:54:19,158
l won't use this surname of yours
after we are married

2537
02:54:19,800 --> 02:54:20,277
Don't get hyper

2538
02:54:21,040 --> 02:54:22,712
Are you Vatsan's
Kosaksi Pasapugazh?

2539

Yeah...i think so

2541
02:54:27,680 --> 02:54:29,193
Whoever gave you
such a tongue twister name?!

2542
02:54:30,560 --> 02:54:31,754
Are you a scientist
or a teacher?

2543

But l also teach children

2544
02:54:37,760 --> 02:54:39,318

Low grade fella!!!

Which pen do you mean?

2557
02:55:20,360 --> 02:55:22,590
The one in your hand
that belongs to Virus

2558
02:55:28,240 --> 02:55:29,275
Mr Pasapugazh

2559
02:55:30,840 --> 02:55:32,159
Hi Mr Vatsannnn!

K for Karpazhippu(rape)!

2562
02:55:49,200 --> 02:55:51,760
This is all common in friendship

2563
02:55:55,920 --> 02:55:56,989
That's a good one, huh?

2564
02:55:57,760 --> 02:55:59,671

Don't go behind success
