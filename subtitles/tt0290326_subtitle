1
00:01:00,107 --> 00:01:05,101
"'I will not wish
for anything, but you"'

2
00:01:05,712 --> 00:01:11,116
'I will love you
till I live'

3
00:01:11,618 --> 00:01:15,714
"'love, love!"'

4
00:02:14,114 --> 00:02:19,245
'My eyes wish to see you'

5
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:25,114
'my heart wishes to love you'

6
00:02:28,728 --> 00:02:34,064
'i'm lost in your love'

7
00:02:34,668 --> 00:02:40,072
'how shall i tell you
what i'm feeling'

8
00:02:40,874 --> 00:02:43,069
'you will shy away'

9
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:54,885
'you will shy away'

10
00:02:55,589 --> 00:03:00,686
'i will play such a mischief
with my eyes'

11
00:03:01,495 --> 00:03:06,694
"'i will not wish
for anything, but you"'

12
00:03:07,501 --> 00:03:12,700
'i will love you
till i live'

13
00:03:24,718 --> 00:03:26,379
"'love, love!"'

14
00:03:56,082 --> 00:03:58,073
Your father must
be proud of you?

15
00:03:59,085 --> 00:04:00,484
'Wish this woulïve
happened, but..."

16
00:04:02,756 --> 00:04:06,351
parents died
in a road accident.

17
00:04:34,554 --> 00:04:36,784
You are a worthless man.

18
00:04:37,057 --> 00:04:38,046
You call your friend
from canada to mumbai...

19
00:04:38,858 --> 00:04:40,587
...and don't even come
to receive him at the airport.

20
00:04:41,061 --> 00:04:42,653
I'm going back
by the evening flight.

21
00:04:43,063 --> 00:04:44,325
"Look, I'm really sorry."

22
00:04:44,397 --> 00:04:46,058
My interview was going to be
aired on television.

23
00:04:46,099 --> 00:04:48,727
I went off to sleep waiting
for it. I couldn't watch it.

24
00:04:52,072 --> 00:04:54,870
Please forgive me.

25
00:04:55,342 --> 00:04:57,071
Atleast embrace me once.

26
00:04:57,477 --> 00:04:59,240
- Won't you embrace me?
- Say it once again.

27
00:05:03,483 --> 00:05:05,747
"How are you, friend?"

28
00:05:06,486 --> 00:05:07,885
How did you become wet?

29
00:05:07,921 --> 00:05:09,752
It's three days
since 'holi' got over.

30
00:05:09,823 --> 00:05:11,882
But our neighbour's kids
are still playing it.

31
00:05:12,092 --> 00:05:13,491
They threw a water
balloon at me.

32
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,228
They must be the kids next
door. They are very naughty.

33
00:05:18,098 --> 00:05:20,032
Do one thing.
Go and change.

34
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:23,035
I will change later.
First you make a drink for me.

35
00:05:23,103 --> 00:05:24,593
Did you see the time?

36
00:05:24,704 --> 00:05:26,501
If this is not the time
for a drink. Make coffee.

37
00:05:26,706 --> 00:05:27,900
I am making coffee.

38
00:05:28,608 --> 00:05:30,701
"Anyway, I will have to do
whatever you say today."

39
00:05:31,378 --> 00:05:32,709
Why don't you do one thing?

40
00:05:36,316 --> 00:05:39,046
How can anyone be comfortable
in a one room flat?

41
00:05:39,452 --> 00:05:43,445
Everything is
in the same room.

42
00:05:43,657 --> 00:05:45,557
Do one thing.
Built a bathroom hereitself.

43
00:05:48,528 --> 00:05:50,689
"By the way, this is
called a studio apartment."

44
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:53,324
You may call if a bungalow.
It will remain a one room flat.

45
00:05:55,068 --> 00:05:59,368
'That reminds me, you had built
a bungalow for yourself, right?"

46
00:05:59,472 --> 00:06:00,734
Why don't you stay there?

47
00:06:02,876 --> 00:06:04,070
"I had built it for my parents.
But after them..."

48
00:06:05,078 --> 00:06:06,477
...I don't feel like
going there.

49
00:06:08,081 --> 00:06:11,346
I go there every 'Diwali'
to light lamps.

50
00:06:14,087 --> 00:06:18,217
This year's FDA award has
proved that Shekhar is the best.

51
00:06:18,491 --> 00:06:20,584
Shekhar is the star
of the evening.

52
00:06:57,464 --> 00:07:00,399
"By the way, I do the same
in canada what you do here."

53
00:07:01,067 --> 00:07:04,059
I run a small industry by
the name of Shah industries.

54
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:16,071
'Add some love
to this drink'

55
00:07:19,753 --> 00:07:25,817
'o' beautiful maiden'

56
00:08:01,728 --> 00:08:05,220
'you are my destination'
'you are my fate'

57
00:08:05,465 --> 00:08:08,662
"'with you, I don't lack
for anything in life"'

58
00:08:09,068 --> 00:08:12,595
"'give me love,
take my heart"'

59
00:08:12,872 --> 00:08:15,864
"'o' beauty,
you are my darling"'

60
00:08:16,075 --> 00:08:19,067
'quench the thirst of my eyes'

61
00:08:32,025 --> 00:08:34,016
'o' my love! '

62
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:49,201
- Will you leave today itself?
- Yes.

63
00:08:49,309 --> 00:08:50,640
"- Nice to meet you.
- Me, too."

64
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:53,543
- Do you know what
a wedding dress is? - Yes.

65
00:08:54,047 --> 00:08:55,639
- Is this the one?
- Yes.

66
00:08:55,849 --> 00:08:58,647
Piya had asked for it.
I am getting married next week.

67
00:09:24,878 --> 00:09:28,405
"'I swear by god,
you are very dear to me"'

68
00:09:28,681 --> 00:09:32,082
'i love every style of yours'

69
00:09:32,352 --> 00:09:35,753
"'your loves is wonderful,
so is your beauty"'

70
00:09:36,089 --> 00:09:39,081
'you makes my heart go weak'

71
00:09:39,259 --> 00:09:42,092
'quench the thirst of my eyes'

72
00:09:46,499 --> 00:09:49,696
'add some love
to this drink'

73
00:09:55,108 --> 00:09:58,771
'o' my love! '

74
00:10:29,142 --> 00:10:31,736
I'm not joking.
Les place a bet of 100 -.

75
00:10:33,079 --> 00:10:34,740
I will certainly call you
to canada.

76
00:10:35,081 --> 00:10:36,571
I am very happy here.

77
00:10:38,084 --> 00:10:39,073
Alright then.

78
00:10:39,352 --> 00:10:42,685
I will take this note back from
you when you come to canada.

79
00:10:43,089 --> 00:10:44,488
Or else i lose the bet.

80
00:11:02,108 --> 00:11:07,603
"Hey mister, you will
make me miss my wedding."

81
00:11:08,114 --> 00:11:09,513
How much more time
will it take?

82
00:11:10,116 --> 00:11:12,641
I will miss the flight.
Why don't you think of that?

83
00:11:12,719 --> 00:11:13,777
I can't say
how long ill take.

84
00:11:13,853 --> 00:11:15,115
Is better if
you take another taxi.

85
00:11:17,523 --> 00:11:19,582
"Alright, tell me how far
the airport is from here?"

86
00:11:19,659 --> 00:11:20,853
One kilometer at the most.

87
00:11:20,927 --> 00:11:23,725
It will take 4 minutes by taxi.
You can even go walking.

88
00:11:28,134 --> 00:11:29,601
"Yes, i'm on the walk."

89
00:11:29,936 --> 00:11:31,403
The taxi broke down.

90
00:11:35,074 --> 00:11:40,205
This taxi driver is
stopping me from coming to you.

91
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:45,244
But i won't heed.
I will go walking.

92
00:12:52,585 --> 00:12:54,678
"Amar, listen.
Get up."

93
00:13:05,898 --> 00:13:07,559
Have you gone mad? We will
take him to the hospital.

94
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,090
Check his pulse.
He is dead.

95
00:13:09,235 --> 00:13:10,429
"Before going
to the hospital..."

96
00:13:10,603 --> 00:13:11,763
...we'll have to go to
the police station. Les go.

97
00:13:13,106 --> 00:13:14,403
No.

98
00:13:25,118 --> 00:13:26,779
"No, shekhar."

99
00:13:29,522 --> 00:13:30,716
What are you doing?

100
00:13:31,858 --> 00:13:33,189
Why did you
disconnect the phone?

101
00:13:33,326 --> 00:13:36,056
I've written such a romantic
poem. Now listen.

102
00:13:37,063 --> 00:13:38,052
Don't laugh.

103
00:13:41,534 --> 00:13:43,229
"'Without you, how can i live"'

104
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:46,131
'how can i live without you'

105
00:13:47,073 --> 00:13:48,734
'the nights seem
as long as ages'

106
00:13:49,542 --> 00:13:51,407
'the days seem
as long as ages'

107
00:13:52,478 --> 00:13:53,877
'you come back'

108
00:13:54,747 --> 00:13:58,683
"'my heart says,
come back"'

109
00:14:02,088 --> 00:14:04,079
'lonely i feel again'

110
00:14:05,091 --> 00:14:06,581
'i miss you again'

111
00:14:07,493 --> 00:14:09,085
'i am nervous again'

112
00:14:10,096 --> 00:14:11,893
'you are making me restless'

113
00:14:13,599 --> 00:14:17,091
"'come back, says my heart"'

114
00:14:18,704 --> 00:14:22,902
"'what all i've thought,
i have some many dreams"'

115
00:14:23,709 --> 00:14:28,271
'my heart has so many
wishes and desires'

116
00:14:29,582 --> 00:14:31,777
'storms pass through
my hear

117
00:14:32,718 --> 00:14:34,709
'i can't live without you'

118
00:14:35,655 --> 00:14:39,318
"'come back, says my heart"'

119
00:14:40,459 --> 00:14:43,656
"'come back, says my heart"'

120
00:14:45,064 --> 00:14:47,055
'how can i live without you'

121
00:14:47,867 --> 00:14:49,664
"'without you, how can i live"'

122
00:14:50,236 --> 00:14:51,726
"did you like my poem, amar?"

123
00:15:20,099 --> 00:15:23,694
"Shekhar, remove
your t shirt."

124
00:15:25,104 --> 00:15:26,093
Hurry up.

125
00:15:28,107 --> 00:15:29,438
Remove your t shirt quickly.

126
00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:08,068
Be careful.

127
00:16:28,501 --> 00:16:32,437
'We inquired in many houses,
but no one knows anything."

128
00:16:32,638 --> 00:16:34,629
Everyone says
they didn't see anything.

129
00:16:36,842 --> 00:16:38,969
We have taken
the details of the boy.

130
00:16:40,646 --> 00:16:42,443
His name was Amar Shah.

131
00:16:43,049 --> 00:16:46,450
He has a canadian passport.

132
00:16:47,653 --> 00:16:50,349
He had come to mumbai
by this morning's flight.

133
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:56,858
And he was returning
by the 4 o'clock flight.

134
00:16:59,398 --> 00:17:01,389
I found out from the hotel.

135
00:17:01,867 --> 00:17:06,065
"He was going to the airport,
but his taxi broke down."

136
00:17:07,073 --> 00:17:08,870
So he decided to go walking.

137
00:17:09,742 --> 00:17:12,472
His body lied here
till 40 minutes.

138
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:15,078
We got a call later.

139
00:17:15,481 --> 00:17:17,676
We have informed his family.

140
00:17:19,085 --> 00:17:20,575
They must be on their way.

141
00:17:21,754 --> 00:17:24,689
It takes 28 hours
to reach here from canada.

142
00:17:25,491 --> 00:17:26,890
"Okay, i'll leave."

143
00:17:34,433 --> 00:17:38,426
You know how long he was lying
on the road after the accident?

144
00:17:39,038 --> 00:17:41,029
"You don't, right?
A full 40 minutes."

145
00:17:41,841 --> 00:17:44,833
"If no one came to his rescue
then, now there's no need."

146
00:17:45,044 --> 00:17:46,534
We will manage.

147
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:52,847
"Come on, get going."

148
00:17:53,052 --> 00:17:54,644
There is no show going on here.

149
00:17:55,988 --> 00:17:58,047
Someone has lost his life.

150
00:17:59,992 --> 00:18:02,222
Go home back to sleep.

151
00:18:29,088 --> 00:18:31,955
"Mr. Shah, i am very sorry."

152
00:18:33,025 --> 00:18:38,019
"I promise you that some day,
that man..."

153
00:19:05,057 --> 00:19:08,254
i had come to mumbai for a day.
I had heard a lot about you.

154
00:19:08,327 --> 00:19:09,726
I thought i should meet you.

155
00:19:10,729 --> 00:19:12,321
You know what
a wedding dress is?

156
00:19:12,465 --> 00:19:15,059
Piya had asked for it.
Next week is my wedding.

157
00:19:19,338 --> 00:19:22,239
"Look, d'mello, he is
a z catogory minister."

158
00:19:22,675 --> 00:19:23,733
Divert the force.

159
00:19:24,477 --> 00:19:25,876
The arrangement
should be perfect.

160
00:19:26,579 --> 00:19:28,069
"Sir, i need permission."

161
00:19:29,482 --> 00:19:31,677
I want to put up checkposts
and find that vehicle.

162
00:19:31,884 --> 00:19:33,408
'Which vehicle, d'mello?"

163
00:19:33,486 --> 00:19:35,215
An accident has occured
as the milan subway.

164
00:19:36,088 --> 00:19:38,079
Three months have passed.

165
00:19:39,091 --> 00:19:40,388
"How do i forget, sir?"

166
00:19:43,596 --> 00:19:45,496
It doesn't affect
your record in anyway.

167
00:19:45,598 --> 00:19:46,587
Les go.

168
00:19:49,101 --> 00:19:51,092
But if affects my sleep.

169
00:19:52,771 --> 00:19:56,229
"If the accident has occured,
someone was surely driving."

170
00:19:57,109 --> 00:20:00,101
"And if someone was
driving the vehicle..."

171
00:20:01,113 --> 00:20:05,049
...i will keep the case
pending till i find him.

172
00:20:05,518 --> 00:20:06,917
Stop the car.

173
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:10,111
It is 1.35 a.m.
We are late.

174
00:20:10,523 --> 00:20:13,117
I didn't know we'll get stuck
in the traffic in the night.

175
00:20:15,528 --> 00:20:16,722
Give me.

176
00:20:19,131 --> 00:20:21,122
I'll park the car and
be back in 2 minutes.

177
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,631
The flight will leave
by the time you come.

178
00:20:27,139 --> 00:20:28,128
Please don't go.

179
00:20:31,076 --> 00:20:32,065
"Okay, go."

180
00:20:33,078 --> 00:20:35,478
- Take care. Okay?
- Yes.

181
00:20:35,748 --> 00:20:37,079
Forget what happened.

182
00:20:37,483 --> 00:20:39,246
I will call you up
as soon as i reach.

183
00:21:33,072 --> 00:21:36,735
"'What all i've thought,
i have some many dreams"'

184
00:21:37,876 --> 00:21:41,744
'my heart has so many
wishes and desires'

185
00:21:42,748 --> 00:21:44,613
'storms pass through
my hear

186
00:21:45,551 --> 00:21:47,348
'i can't live without you'

187
00:21:48,253 --> 00:21:51,689
"'come back, says my heart"'

188
00:21:53,492 --> 00:21:55,084
'how can i live without you'

189
00:21:56,095 --> 00:21:57,756
"'without you, how can i live"'

190
00:22:12,511 --> 00:22:13,842
les place a bet of 100 -.

191
00:22:15,114 --> 00:22:19,517
I will certainly call you
to canada.

192
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:24,787
I will take this note back from
you when you come to canada.

193
00:22:25,124 --> 00:22:26,921
I will certainly call you
to canada.

194
00:23:07,499 --> 00:23:09,831
"- The flight was a long one,
wasn't it? - Yes."

195
00:23:13,505 --> 00:23:14,767
Did you sleep well?

196
00:23:43,869 --> 00:23:45,393
I thought you must
have forgotten.

197
00:23:47,473 --> 00:23:48,872
"I tried very hard, but..."

198
00:23:49,074 --> 00:23:50,735
then what have
you come here for?

199
00:23:55,748 --> 00:23:56,806
What is your intention?

200
00:23:58,083 --> 00:23:59,812
I have come to apologise.

201
00:24:00,085 --> 00:24:02,679
You are too much! Do you
think they will forgive you?

202
00:24:03,088 --> 00:24:04,487
But i was not at fault.

203
00:24:04,556 --> 00:24:07,081
Only we know. No one else knows
that it was not your fault.

204
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,024
"Yes, maybe amar knows."

205
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:12,088
They will not forgive you.

206
00:24:12,364 --> 00:24:13,831
I will do whatever they say.

207
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,934
"Either hand me over to the
police, or punish me themselves."

208
00:24:17,503 --> 00:24:19,437
You have gone crazy.

209
00:24:20,105 --> 00:24:22,096
Since five years i have been
telling you to come to canada.

210
00:24:22,174 --> 00:24:24,369
You didn't come then.
You have come now.

211
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:26,205
And you're saying that you'll
accept any punishment they give.

212
00:24:26,378 --> 00:24:28,107
Do you know who all
are there in his family?

213
00:24:30,115 --> 00:24:34,711
"He has a sister, father,
grandmother, and his fiancee."

214
00:24:35,053 --> 00:24:36,714
At whose all hands will
you accept punishment?

215
00:24:37,055 --> 00:24:39,216
And why?
When it was not your fault?

216
00:24:40,859 --> 00:24:42,986
Try to understand.
It won't be easy.

217
00:24:44,196 --> 00:24:46,061
"Anyway, nothing
is easy, right?"

218
00:24:47,332 --> 00:24:49,323
"Neither for them,
nor for me."

219
00:24:49,735 --> 00:24:51,726
Alright then.
Do what your heart says.

220
00:24:53,071 --> 00:24:55,403
"Get in the car. You don't
want to listen to me, do you?"

221
00:25:52,064 --> 00:25:53,656
- Yes?
- Amar shah...

222
00:25:54,066 --> 00:25:56,660
- but he is...
- i know.

223
00:25:57,669 --> 00:25:59,660
- You are...?
- I work here.

224
00:26:00,472 --> 00:26:03,270
- Is anyone home right now?
- Grandma is doing her prayers.

225
00:26:03,342 --> 00:26:04,331
Come in.

226
00:26:09,481 --> 00:26:12,075
"Sit here, grandma will
come after her prayers."

227
00:26:39,044 --> 00:26:43,981
Greetings!
My name is shekhar malhotra.

228
00:26:46,051 --> 00:26:47,518
I've come from mumbai.

229
00:26:49,554 --> 00:26:53,046
I had met amar...

230
00:26:54,059 --> 00:26:57,051
...in mumbai.

231
00:26:59,464 --> 00:27:01,932
We met at a party.

232
00:27:04,336 --> 00:27:09,330
We spent quiet
some time together.

233
00:27:11,076 --> 00:27:15,069
'Then, amar left
for the airport..."

234
00:27:16,081 --> 00:27:20,347
...and i left for home.

235
00:27:28,093 --> 00:27:34,123
Amar met with
an accident with my car.

236
00:27:39,705 --> 00:27:44,733
"Sir, i and basko left
the party in my car."

237
00:27:45,978 --> 00:27:51,382
And the street was desolated
and i was driving very fast.

238
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:53,645
"I took a right turn..."

239
00:27:54,052 --> 00:27:58,318
"...there was a big bungalow
ahead, its gate. I don't know..."

240
00:27:58,857 --> 00:28:04,056
...where a small girl came
from running after her dog.

241
00:28:06,064 --> 00:28:08,055
She suddenly came
in front of my car.

242
00:28:08,233 --> 00:28:11,066
'To save her..."

243
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:14,402
...the moment i took
a right turn.

244
00:28:15,073 --> 00:28:17,667
And the car banged
against something. And...

245
00:28:18,877 --> 00:28:20,071
...i applied the brake.
I and basko got down...

246
00:28:21,079 --> 00:28:25,072
...and we came in front
of the car. We saw amar...

247
00:28:28,353 --> 00:28:33,017
amar was soaked in blood.

248
00:28:41,033 --> 00:28:42,432
If you still feel that...

249
00:28:45,037 --> 00:28:49,201
"...i am to be blamed, i
accept any punishment you give."

250
00:28:49,307 --> 00:28:51,639
Whom are you talking to?
Sir does not speak.

251
00:28:52,044 --> 00:28:57,710
"Since he cremated amar,
he does not speak nor listen."

252
00:28:59,051 --> 00:29:01,042
"You take a seat,
i will call grandma."

253
00:29:20,072 --> 00:29:21,471
Who is it?

254
00:29:23,675 --> 00:29:25,074
'Who was it, girdhari?"

255
00:30:17,529 --> 00:30:20,123
"Ms. Piya, we have evaluated
all the property."

256
00:30:20,532 --> 00:30:22,932
And all this property is not
worth even half the loan amount.

257
00:30:23,635 --> 00:30:26,297
"If the regular installment
does not reach of time..."

258
00:30:27,539 --> 00:30:29,871
...the entire property will
be auctioned by next 20th.

259
00:31:49,688 --> 00:31:52,088
'As if a life time
has passed...

260
00:31:55,093 --> 00:32:00,087
...staying awake'

261
00:32:12,377 --> 00:32:16,108
'as if i'm alive...

262
00:32:17,115 --> 00:32:22,781
...but not breathing'

263
00:32:23,722 --> 00:32:26,714
'as if there's a plea...

264
00:32:27,125 --> 00:32:33,064
...buried in your heart

265
00:32:46,678 --> 00:32:50,079
'as if you've said something...

266
00:32:51,082 --> 00:32:56,076
...through your eyes'

267
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:59,215
"look, we cannot
bring back amar."

268
00:32:59,491 --> 00:33:02,085
But right now
their major problem is...

269
00:33:03,094 --> 00:33:06,359
...their sinking business.
You can help them revive it.

270
00:33:06,564 --> 00:33:10,557
- Will they let me do that?
- Why will they not?

271
00:33:13,505 --> 00:33:17,100
I am trying my best to
get a six month extension.

272
00:33:18,376 --> 00:33:19,775
And what if we don't?

273
00:33:20,912 --> 00:33:22,607
Then they do the auction.

274
00:33:24,516 --> 00:33:25,778
Is there no other option?

275
00:33:27,118 --> 00:33:28,107
The best that can happen is...

276
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,782
...shah industries should
start running again like before.

277
00:33:32,524 --> 00:33:35,459
So that the market and
the bank gains confidence in us.

278
00:33:36,061 --> 00:33:37,858
And all this should happen
within a month's time.

279
00:33:39,664 --> 00:33:41,598
I am talking of a miracle.

280
00:33:43,868 --> 00:33:47,201
"Miracles happen only in stories,
mr. Jain, not in real life."

281
00:33:53,078 --> 00:33:56,070
"- Alright, I'll leave. I'll
call up in the evening. - Okay."

282
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:07,080
My name is Shekhar Malhotra.

283
00:34:07,892 --> 00:34:11,089
I had met amar in mumbai.

284
00:34:14,566 --> 00:34:18,093
He had given me an offer
to work for shah industries.

285
00:34:21,606 --> 00:34:25,599
"Mr. Shekhar, about 8 months ago,
in a road accident, amar..."

286
00:34:26,111 --> 00:34:28,102
i know.

287
00:34:32,450 --> 00:34:34,680
We don't have any vacancy now.

288
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:38,052
Just a minute. You can at least
check my credentials.

289
00:34:39,057 --> 00:34:41,685
"Look, mr. Shekhar..."

290
00:34:44,062 --> 00:34:45,051
look madam.

291
00:34:51,069 --> 00:34:53,401
I was sent to holand for
t.f.c. Exchange program.

292
00:34:59,577 --> 00:35:02,478
"In my previous job, i got 3
promotions within six months."

293
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:05,581
"In five years time, i was
made the vp of the company."

294
00:35:06,484 --> 00:35:10,386
"In mumbai, people say that
no one works better than me."

295
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:23,499
You want to work
with shah industries?

296
00:35:24,903 --> 00:35:26,768
What do you know
about shah industries?

297
00:35:27,105 --> 00:35:28,094
Come.

298
00:35:30,442 --> 00:35:34,037
"Before working here, know
some things about the company."

299
00:35:36,548 --> 00:35:38,038
"Do you know that
after amar's death..."

300
00:35:39,050 --> 00:35:42,042
...the price of our company's
shares fell drastically?

301
00:35:45,657 --> 00:35:46,646
This mr. Markis.

302
00:35:55,467 --> 00:35:56,661
And this is ms. Anna.

303
00:35:59,871 --> 00:36:01,065
'Within three months
after she joined..."

304
00:36:01,339 --> 00:36:03,671
...her mother underwent
an open heart surgery.

305
00:36:05,343 --> 00:36:06,674
The office sponsored it.

306
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:12,072
"Suddenly she felt, this office
is too far from her house."

307
00:36:21,092 --> 00:36:22,081
This is mr. Bhatia.

308
00:36:24,095 --> 00:36:27,496
Mr. Bhatia worked with
the company for 14 years.

309
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:31,034
He used to sit here
since five years.

310
00:36:34,038 --> 00:36:36,029
He had gone on a short leave.
He did not return till today.

311
00:36:37,842 --> 00:36:39,434
We recieve his resignation
by post.

312
00:36:43,047 --> 00:36:44,378
Everyone has the same story.

313
00:36:47,852 --> 00:36:49,376
'Today, in the stock
and finance market..."

314
00:36:50,054 --> 00:36:52,818
...shah industires
is a sinking ship.

315
00:36:53,858 --> 00:36:56,827
Please don't try to
board this ship.

316
00:36:58,062 --> 00:36:59,654
"Let those who
are sinking, sink."

317
00:37:01,065 --> 00:37:02,726
There is no place for you on it.

318
00:37:02,867 --> 00:37:06,735
"Madam, you want to
break amar's promise?"

319
00:37:07,672 --> 00:37:10,232
What promise are
you talking about?

320
00:37:13,077 --> 00:37:15,671
'With amar's death,
all his promises are broken."

321
00:37:18,583 --> 00:37:20,346
'The promises he made to you..."

322
00:37:23,087 --> 00:37:24,611
...and those who he made to me.

323
00:37:31,829 --> 00:37:35,356
"Madam, look,
i can help you."

324
00:37:37,435 --> 00:37:38,834
I don't even want
a salary for now.

325
00:37:40,838 --> 00:37:43,705
Maybe this sinking ship
can float again.

326
00:37:44,842 --> 00:37:46,173
Please think about it.

327
00:37:49,647 --> 00:37:52,047
You should have appointed
the boy for a few days.

328
00:37:53,051 --> 00:37:54,450
Maybe he coulïve helped us.

329
00:37:56,721 --> 00:37:58,712
"After all, amar
had selected him."

330
00:38:00,224 --> 00:38:02,055
There must be something
special about him.

331
00:38:04,462 --> 00:38:08,262
"I'm sure, there must be.
But is too late now."

332
00:38:08,866 --> 00:38:13,735
I had spoken to mr. Jain.
I have no hopes left.

333
00:38:13,871 --> 00:38:15,862
"One must never lose hope, child."

334
00:38:17,075 --> 00:38:18,736
The world survives on hope.

335
00:38:20,411 --> 00:38:23,847
"And then, your entire life
is ahead of you."

336
00:38:25,683 --> 00:38:28,243
Everybody is sorry
about amar's death.

337
00:38:29,587 --> 00:38:32,818
"But you have to forget
all this, and move ahead."

338
00:38:38,830 --> 00:38:40,627
I can never forget amar.

339
00:38:44,702 --> 00:38:46,294
"Hey, listen to me."

340
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:51,040
"Child, perhaps you can
make her understand."

341
00:38:54,045 --> 00:38:59,176
Amar is dead. Why is
she ruining her life?

342
00:39:02,053 --> 00:39:07,457
"Getting her married is our
duty, our responsibility."

343
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:12,223
"She was our daughter-in-law
before, not she is our daughter."

344
00:39:15,066 --> 00:39:18,467
"Don't worry, grandma.
Everything will be alright."

345
00:39:22,473 --> 00:39:26,068
God must have chosen
a prince for her somewhere.

346
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:32,743
'The day she meets him,
she will forget amar."

347
00:39:35,086 --> 00:39:36,417
"- But grandma...
- yes?"

348
00:39:37,488 --> 00:39:40,082
"It would be so nice, if piya
would become my sister-in-law."

349
00:39:50,101 --> 00:39:51,830
- I'll leave.
- Okay.

350
00:39:52,704 --> 00:39:57,038
"- Fufu must be waiting. I
had promised her. - Go, dear."

351
00:40:04,115 --> 00:40:05,844
What a strange man he is!

352
00:40:06,117 --> 00:40:08,108
He is ready to work
without pay?

353
00:40:08,286 --> 00:40:10,277
You should have appointed
him immediately.

354
00:40:10,788 --> 00:40:12,915
Who knows when someone
could be helpful.

355
00:40:15,126 --> 00:40:18,118
I was so rude to him that he
musve returned to mumbai.

356
00:41:46,083 --> 00:41:47,482
What are you doing?

357
00:41:48,352 --> 00:41:51,344
I was cleaning.
But the bulb had fused.

358
00:41:51,489 --> 00:41:53,889
I tried to repair it.
A short circuit took place.

359
00:41:54,091 --> 00:41:55,490
The siren started.
I didn't...

360
00:41:56,093 --> 00:41:59,824
the bulb is fused.
And i even go a electric shock.

361
00:42:03,367 --> 00:42:04,561
Shall i pick it?

362
00:42:07,605 --> 00:42:09,436
"- It is a fax.
- Oh, this?!"

363
00:42:10,107 --> 00:42:12,041
The machine is too small.

364
00:42:47,578 --> 00:42:49,808
"- Ms. Piya, this letter...?
- Yes?"

365
00:42:50,081 --> 00:42:51,070
Why did you throw it?

366
00:42:52,083 --> 00:42:53,573
It is of no use to me.

367
00:42:54,085 --> 00:42:55,780
Perhaps you did not
read it properly.

368
00:42:56,087 --> 00:42:57,577
They have asked for a quotation.

369
00:42:58,356 --> 00:42:59,880
It is an order worth
atleast 20 million.

370
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:05,090
- We can't take this order.
- We can at least try.

371
00:43:08,699 --> 00:43:11,099
"Look mr. Shekhar, the company
does not have enough money..."

372
00:43:11,502 --> 00:43:13,094
...to accept such a big order.

373
00:43:13,437 --> 00:43:14,768
We haven't got the order yet.

374
00:43:15,106 --> 00:43:17,574
'We'll get the money,
once we get the order."

375
00:43:18,609 --> 00:43:23,376
"Ms. Piya, i hope you have the
today's exchange rate list?"

376
00:43:41,065 --> 00:43:42,532
You will not send
this quotation.

377
00:43:44,535 --> 00:43:47,060
You are using my computer
without my permission.

378
00:43:51,075 --> 00:43:53,066
I had told you earlier that...

379
00:43:53,477 --> 00:43:55,468
...the company does not have
funds to handle such an order.

380
00:44:02,486 --> 00:44:03,578
I had told you yesterday...

381
00:44:06,090 --> 00:44:08,081
"in my previous job, i got
3 promotions within 6 months."

382
00:44:09,493 --> 00:44:10,755
"In the past 5 years,
i was made..."

383
00:44:11,095 --> 00:44:12,892
...the vice president
of the company. Why?

384
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:17,499
What do you think of yourself?

385
00:44:18,502 --> 00:44:20,902
Do you know that i allowed
you to come in this office?

386
00:44:21,505 --> 00:44:22,904
Because amar had promised you.

387
00:44:24,108 --> 00:44:27,509
And now you will tell me
which letter to respond to?

388
00:44:29,113 --> 00:44:32,549
"You used my computer, my entire
office without my permission."

389
00:44:33,451 --> 00:44:35,646
Do you know you
have no right to do this?

390
00:45:17,094 --> 00:45:18,823
We have received your quotation.

391
00:45:19,096 --> 00:45:20,688
The gm wants to meet you.

392
00:45:21,098 --> 00:45:24,431
- Will tomorrow 10 a.m.
Suit you? - Yes?!

393
00:45:32,043 --> 00:45:33,977
- This one?
- What printing is this?!

394
00:45:34,045 --> 00:45:35,034
The printer was bad.

395
00:45:37,048 --> 00:45:38,037
This?

396
00:45:39,050 --> 00:45:41,041
"- I am piya speaking.
- Yes, tell me."

397
00:45:41,185 --> 00:45:43,449
There's a stupid problem.

398
00:45:44,055 --> 00:45:46,853
- That boy shekhar...
- what happened to him?

399
00:45:47,458 --> 00:45:49,551
Nothing happened to him.
At least let me finish.

400
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:51,389
You scolded him again
and drew him out?

401
00:45:52,463 --> 00:45:55,796
"Yes.
And now, itbt called up."

402
00:45:56,267 --> 00:45:57,859
They gave me an appointment
of 10 a.m. Tomorrow.

403
00:45:58,669 --> 00:46:01,866
I am not even aware of
what quotation he had sent.

404
00:46:03,074 --> 00:46:05,008
Where do i look
for that nut now?

405
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:12,072
"Actually, i have this habit
since childhood..."

406
00:46:13,084 --> 00:46:16,485
"...that whenever i'm scolded,
i begin to feel hungry."

407
00:46:22,593 --> 00:46:24,584
"- Will you have?
- No, thank you."

408
00:46:28,499 --> 00:46:30,831
- Are all your phones
working fine? - Why?

409
00:46:32,436 --> 00:46:34,836
- You will receive a call.
- Whose call?

410
00:46:35,539 --> 00:46:39,976
From itbt. We had sent
them a quotation. They'll call.

411
00:46:40,644 --> 00:46:42,168
They've called me
at 10 a.m. Tomorrow.

412
00:46:42,546 --> 00:46:43,979
So you received
the call already?!

413
00:46:45,449 --> 00:46:46,973
Now do you agree
that i can work?

414
00:46:48,853 --> 00:46:51,583
Reach office at 9 am tomorrow.
It is a 45 minute drive.

415
00:46:53,457 --> 00:46:55,049
That means my job is confirmed.

416
00:47:01,065 --> 00:47:03,465
I will prepare the proposal.

417
00:47:03,667 --> 00:47:07,068
"You'll see, we both will
make this sinking ship..."

418
00:47:08,072 --> 00:47:09,801
...go around the world.

419
00:47:40,638 --> 00:47:42,037
Did you hear that?

420
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:46,305
Now this sinking ship
will go around the world.

421
00:47:46,644 --> 00:47:49,545
"'Without you, what is life"'

422
00:47:50,447 --> 00:47:52,779
'... what is life'

423
00:47:53,517 --> 00:47:57,044
"'without you, what is life"'

424
00:47:58,455 --> 00:48:01,788
"'without you, how can i live"'

425
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:07,554
'how can i live without you'

426
00:48:08,065 --> 00:48:12,058
'the nights seem
as long as ages'

427
00:48:13,070 --> 00:48:17,336
'the days seem
as long as ages'

428
00:48:18,075 --> 00:48:21,567
'you come back...

429
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:27,549
...says my hear

430
00:48:52,209 --> 00:48:56,043
'lonely i feel again'

431
00:48:57,047 --> 00:49:00,380
'i miss you again'

432
00:49:02,052 --> 00:49:05,647
'i am nervous again'

433
00:49:06,457 --> 00:49:11,053
'you are making me restless'

434
00:49:16,567 --> 00:49:20,731
"'in my heart,
there are several memories"'

435
00:49:21,071 --> 00:49:25,872
"'without you,
i am ionely now"'

436
00:49:26,343 --> 00:49:30,074
"'come back..."

'my heart had

'storms pass through

00:50:44,088 --> 00:50:48,491

"'come back..."

445
00:50:53,597 --> 00:50:57,897

446
00:50:58,602 --> 00:51:02,595
"'without you, how can i live"'

447
00:51:03,107 --> 00:51:08,101
'how can i live without you'

448
00:52:37,568 --> 00:52:39,058
i am talking to you.

449
00:52:39,236 --> 00:52:41,067
"Yes, it is obvious
you are talking to me."

450
00:52:41,238 --> 00:52:44,230
- What?
- You are talking to me.

451
00:52:46,076 --> 00:52:49,341
"Look, our relationship
is since past 12 years."

452
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:50,742
And i didn't expect
this from you...

453
00:52:51,081 --> 00:52:52,412
...after 12 years
of relationship.

454
00:52:52,683 --> 00:52:56,676
"Sir, you have a 12 yeara
relationship... with her?!"

455
00:52:57,488 --> 00:52:59,888
"If you keep quiet for a minute,
may understand what she means?"

456
00:53:00,557 --> 00:53:03,082
What did you say? What do we
have since past 12 years?

457
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:05,385
- Relationship.
- Oh!

458
00:53:06,096 --> 00:53:08,894
- What?!
- Do you have any doubt?

459
00:53:09,099 --> 00:53:10,566
No. There's not doubt.

460
00:53:10,601 --> 00:53:12,228
'When you are saying,
it must be true."

461
00:53:12,369 --> 00:53:16,362
But i was not aware of it.

462
00:53:17,107 --> 00:53:19,041
- You were what?
- I wasn't aware of it.

463
00:53:19,109 --> 00:53:21,907
I mean i didn't
have the knowledge.

464
00:53:22,279 --> 00:53:24,110
"Look, my boutique
has been buying cloth..."

465
00:53:24,381 --> 00:53:26,372
...from your company
since the past 12 years.

466
00:53:26,917 --> 00:53:29,909
And you say that you don't have
that? What was it you said?

467
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:31,052
Knowledge.

468
00:53:33,056 --> 00:53:35,854
I wondered which relationship
she is talking about.

469
00:53:37,728 --> 00:53:40,196
"Anyway, have a seat."

470
00:53:46,069 --> 00:53:47,661
Have a seat.

471
00:53:48,071 --> 00:53:49,470
"I had just one, i've kept it."

472
00:53:49,873 --> 00:53:52,671
"I mean to say make yourself
comfortable, then we can talk."

473
00:53:54,077 --> 00:53:55,806
"He meant sit down,
not put down."

474
00:53:58,882 --> 00:54:00,076
Now tell me.

475
00:54:01,351 --> 00:54:03,080
"Look, my boutique
has been buying cloth..."

476
00:54:03,587 --> 00:54:05,578
...from your company
since the past 12 years.

477
00:54:06,089 --> 00:54:07,681
We never faced
this problem earlier.

478
00:54:08,225 --> 00:54:10,022
'That ex-manager
of yours, mr. Aslam."

479
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:12,487
"At times, the cheque used to
reach on time, sometimes not."

480
00:54:13,030 --> 00:54:15,692
- He never complaint.
- It wasn't right either.

481
00:54:16,099 --> 00:54:17,760
- What won't right?
- To complaint.

482
00:54:18,569 --> 00:54:21,367
And this new manager
of yours...

483
00:54:22,506 --> 00:54:23,837
how dare he...

484
00:54:24,441 --> 00:54:28,571
he stopped the supply just
because one cheque was late.

485
00:54:29,379 --> 00:54:30,676
"Just a minute, madam."

486
00:54:32,049 --> 00:54:38,215
Your behaviour is upsetting
our relationship.

487
00:54:39,656 --> 00:54:41,453
Please don't talk
in code words.

488
00:54:41,858 --> 00:54:45,055
This is known as urdu
language in hyderabad.

489
00:54:45,562 --> 00:54:47,052
Please sit.

490
00:54:50,667 --> 00:54:53,067
This ordinary man
is called lftikhar.

491
00:54:54,471 --> 00:54:58,407
- Who is that?
- Is me.

492
00:54:58,875 --> 00:55:01,366
"I mean, my name is lftikhar."

493
00:55:01,478 --> 00:55:03,810
But people call me lfti
with love.

494
00:55:05,349 --> 00:55:06,748
My name is ayesha.

495
00:55:07,084 --> 00:55:08,881
People must be calling
you aya with love.

496
00:55:11,355 --> 00:55:17,225
"Ayesha, from now on, you will
keep in touch only with me."

497
00:55:20,497 --> 00:55:24,763
- What?!
- I mean contact.

498
00:55:25,102 --> 00:55:27,434
You will keep
a contact only with me.

499
00:55:27,604 --> 00:55:29,435
Not with this fool.

500
00:55:30,641 --> 00:55:34,702
"Anyway, i am not interested
in keeping a contact with him."

501
00:55:34,845 --> 00:55:37,439
- What?
- I don't feel.

502
00:55:37,648 --> 00:55:38,774
You don't wish.

503
00:55:39,449 --> 00:55:41,041
"- Alright, i'm not interested.
- Right."

504
00:55:41,718 --> 00:55:44,448
- I'll leave.
- How should i say?

505
00:55:45,055 --> 00:55:46,454
I have to go.

506
00:55:46,723 --> 00:55:48,384
- Do come again.
- Sure.

507
00:55:52,663 --> 00:55:55,063
- Do send the cloth.
- I will bring it myself.

508
00:55:57,868 --> 00:55:59,392
"Actually, today
is mili's birthday."

509
00:55:59,469 --> 00:56:02,597
I become confused when
i go to buy a gift alone.

510
00:56:03,340 --> 00:56:04,864
I'm sorry to bother you.

511
00:56:05,242 --> 00:56:07,335
No. Good that you told me.

512
00:56:07,477 --> 00:56:09,741
Or else mili would think
that i didn't even wish her.

513
00:56:14,685 --> 00:56:16,346
This also resembles mili.

514
00:56:18,488 --> 00:56:20,012
- Shall we buy it?
- Immediately.

515
00:56:20,490 --> 00:56:20,751
'The best way
to select a gift..."

516
00:56:22,092 --> 00:56:23,855
...is to take the decision
immediately.

517
00:56:33,437 --> 00:56:35,029
Where did you buy
this dress from?

518
00:56:37,441 --> 00:56:40,842
Why? Fufu has designed it.

519
00:56:41,311 --> 00:56:42,642
No.

520
00:56:44,848 --> 00:56:48,784
Don't you think this hat will
look nice with this dress?

521
00:56:51,054 --> 00:56:54,046
Yes. Ill look very nice.

522
00:56:57,461 --> 00:57:01,397
"If you don't mind, i would
like to gift this hat to you."

523
00:57:04,067 --> 00:57:05,864
I don't wear hats.

524
00:57:07,337 --> 00:57:08,668
Please try it once.

525
00:57:12,075 --> 00:57:14,873
Please try it once. I'll wear
it if you didn't like it.

526
00:57:33,697 --> 00:57:35,028
"I told you, didn't it!"

527
00:57:38,435 --> 00:57:41,131
Your face seems to have
bloomed with this hat.

528
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:47,771
Always stay happy like this.
You look good.

529
00:58:22,078 --> 00:58:24,239
Mili plays the piano very well.

530
00:58:26,683 --> 00:58:28,082
"If she continues to learn
like this..."

531
00:58:29,486 --> 00:58:31,317
...she'll play it
like me one day.

532
00:58:31,421 --> 00:58:32,683
Do you play the piano?

533
00:58:33,023 --> 00:58:36,186
Play? I play
the piano very well.

534
00:58:39,362 --> 00:58:40,761
I can even teach you.

535
00:59:28,345 --> 00:59:29,869
I thought you forgot.

536
00:59:31,081 --> 00:59:32,070
How can anyone forget
the birthday...

537
00:59:32,482 --> 00:59:33,915
...of the most beautiful
girl in the world?

538
00:59:36,586 --> 00:59:40,078
- And what have you bought
for me? - What can i give you?

539
00:59:41,758 --> 00:59:43,350
I've only snatched from you.

540
00:59:44,094 --> 00:59:46,392
"For now, this chocolate."

541
00:59:47,097 --> 00:59:48,496
But you can ask for
anything you like.

542
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:53,034
Alright. Not today.
But i'll ask some other day.

543
00:59:53,103 --> 00:59:54,434
You will have to give.

544
01:00:01,111 --> 01:00:02,100
What shall we go?

545
01:00:04,614 --> 01:00:07,708
Inform all your friends to
come there within half an hour.

546
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:40,074
"Mr. Ikti, you?!"

547
01:00:41,885 --> 01:00:44,080
- Do i look different?
- No.

548
01:00:44,754 --> 01:00:47,882
- I wasn't expecting you.
- I see!

549
01:00:48,892 --> 01:00:53,386
"I was passing from here, so
i felt that i'm very hungry."

550
01:00:55,098 --> 01:00:57,089
"I don't have
anything to eat, here."

551
01:00:58,101 --> 01:01:00,695
Yes! There's a sandwich left.
I'll get it right away.

552
01:01:03,606 --> 01:01:06,097
"- Do you have dinner?
- Yes, i do."

553
01:01:06,509 --> 01:01:08,568
Even i do. How nice!

554
01:01:09,612 --> 01:01:11,773
If you say so.

555
01:01:11,915 --> 01:01:15,783
"No. I mean if
we both had dinner..."

556
01:01:16,519 --> 01:01:19,716
...how about having it
together? - What?!

557
01:01:26,129 --> 01:01:29,121
"- Fufu, where is my gift?
- Here's your gift."

558
01:01:31,568 --> 01:01:35,060
"Lftikhar, she is my neice,
mili. Shekhar and piya."

559
01:02:14,511 --> 01:02:17,912
'This heart has seen
some many dreams'

560
01:02:19,115 --> 01:02:23,279
'what should i do
about these dreams'

561
01:02:24,120 --> 01:02:28,580
"'nor do i know,
neither my heart knows"'

562
01:02:29,426 --> 01:02:33,260
'i don't know
where my destiny lies'

563
01:03:10,900 --> 01:03:14,893
'it is difficult
to control my hear

564
01:03:15,572 --> 01:03:19,770
'it is difficult
to hide my feelings'

565
01:03:20,276 --> 01:03:22,506
'i am not crazy'

566
01:03:22,712 --> 01:03:24,703
'but i am sure'

567
01:03:25,115 --> 01:03:28,607
'she will make me crazy'

568
01:04:24,374 --> 01:04:28,367
'this heart yearns for her'

569
01:04:29,112 --> 01:04:33,310
"'lf i don't see her,
i feel restless"'

570
01:04:33,650 --> 01:04:38,053
"'my feelings,
she does not understand"'

571
01:04:38,655 --> 01:04:42,648
'everytime i keep thinking'

572
01:05:37,847 --> 01:05:40,441
- what happened? - he
is feeling breathless.

573
01:05:40,650 --> 01:05:42,174
Perhaps he is not even
able to breath properly.

574
01:05:43,052 --> 01:05:45,213
"Don't worry,
everything will be fine."

575
01:05:46,456 --> 01:05:49,186
"Yes, everything
is going fine indeed."

576
01:05:51,060 --> 01:05:54,860
Wonder who we have wronged.

577
01:06:03,473 --> 01:06:05,065
He is alright now.
He is sleeping.

578
01:06:06,476 --> 01:06:09,877
I think there's absolutely
nothing wrong with him.

579
01:06:10,580 --> 01:06:13,743
His problem is psychological.

580
01:06:14,083 --> 01:06:15,482
He does not want to live.

581
01:06:20,590 --> 01:06:23,889
Nothing is wrong with him.
He will be alright.

582
01:06:23,926 --> 01:06:25,689
You all were worrying
unnecessarily.

583
01:06:26,095 --> 01:06:29,360
- The doctor said he will be
discharged tomorrow. - Good.

584
01:06:29,499 --> 01:06:30,693
It is only a matter
of one night.

585
01:06:31,434 --> 01:06:34,028
You'll go home and take rest.

586
01:06:34,170 --> 01:06:35,432
I will bring him home
tomorrow morning.

587
01:06:36,339 --> 01:06:39,706
- I will stay with father.
- Why are you getting worried?

588
01:06:39,842 --> 01:06:42,037
"Grandma, i am not worried.
You all go home."

589
01:06:42,445 --> 01:06:43,707
"Alright, then
i will stay here."

590
01:06:45,048 --> 01:06:47,312
I will ask for help
when i need it.

591
01:06:53,356 --> 01:06:55,551
Where did mili go?
Just a minute.

592
01:06:56,059 --> 01:06:58,357
"Fufu, you proceed,
i will bring mili!"

593
01:07:14,677 --> 01:07:16,406
She has become so stubborn.

594
01:07:16,479 --> 01:07:18,470
"Our piya has become wise,
not stubborn."

595
01:07:20,083 --> 01:07:21,482
'What happened, mili?"

596
01:07:22,685 --> 01:07:25,085
Will father leave us and go?

597
01:07:27,090 --> 01:07:28,079
He will.

598
01:07:32,428 --> 01:07:36,421
"Do you know,
i had never thought..."

599
01:07:37,033 --> 01:07:39,831
...that my parents will
leave me and go away.

600
01:07:42,638 --> 01:07:46,199
But they both died one day.

601
01:07:49,846 --> 01:07:53,043
'That night,
god came in my dream."

602
01:07:54,317 --> 01:07:57,184
"He showered his love on me
and said 'sorry', too."

603
01:07:59,055 --> 01:08:03,856
There is a dearth of
good people in his world.

604
01:08:06,229 --> 01:08:08,789
'Whenever he needs
good people..."

605
01:08:10,466 --> 01:08:11,797
...he has to call them
from our world.

606
01:08:13,569 --> 01:08:17,061
"He told me that in some
other part of the world..."

607
01:08:18,074 --> 01:08:20,872
...a child needed parents.

608
01:08:22,612 --> 01:08:24,477
So he sent my parents there.

609
01:08:27,083 --> 01:08:29,483
Where did god send amar?

610
01:08:36,025 --> 01:08:37,424
"I don't know, mili."

611
01:08:40,430 --> 01:08:42,022
Will you tell god something?

612
01:08:44,033 --> 01:08:45,022
What?

613
01:08:46,202 --> 01:08:48,898
Tell him not to send
my father anywhere.

614
01:08:49,439 --> 01:08:51,430
I need him more.

615
01:08:53,443 --> 01:08:55,775
He will not send him anywhere.

616
01:09:28,878 --> 01:09:31,870
I know you don't need any help.

617
01:09:32,748 --> 01:09:35,080
I only came to give you tea.

618
01:10:06,115 --> 01:10:12,315
"'At every meeting..."'

619
01:10:12,655 --> 01:10:15,783
'... i feel... '

620
01:10:28,738 --> 01:10:33,072
'... that as if your gaze... '

621
01:10:34,076 --> 01:10:39,480
'... is asking me something'

622
01:10:59,602 --> 01:11:01,092
everything is clear to you.

623
01:11:03,372 --> 01:11:04,896
I don't want to deceive you.

624
01:11:05,908 --> 01:11:07,500
I had told you the truth.

625
01:11:12,114 --> 01:11:17,279
I don't have the courage
to speak the same truth again.

626
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:24,116
I have gained the pleasure
of having a family...

627
01:11:26,128 --> 01:11:27,618
...after a long time.

628
01:11:30,333 --> 01:11:31,732
I don't want to lose it.

629
01:11:41,877 --> 01:11:45,335
"- Shall i drop you home?
- No, thank you. I'll go."

630
01:11:55,591 --> 01:12:00,153
"'While walking, often..."'

631
01:12:01,263 --> 01:12:04,858
'... i feel that... '

632
01:12:18,114 --> 01:12:22,778
'... as if his gaze is... '

633
01:12:23,119 --> 01:12:28,523
'... secretly following me'

634
01:13:44,066 --> 01:13:48,469
'what happened?
You liked the snow, isn't it?"

635
01:13:49,739 --> 01:13:54,073
You always liked it.
Then what happened today?

636
01:13:56,078 --> 01:13:57,477
Tears are flowing
from these eyes?

637
01:14:00,349 --> 01:14:02,408
Time did not stop
after my death.

638
01:14:02,885 --> 01:14:05,752
The wind did not stop.
You did not stop breathing.

639
01:14:07,089 --> 01:14:08,488
This snow did not stop.

640
01:14:11,694 --> 01:14:13,628
Then how can your life stop.

641
01:14:17,500 --> 01:14:21,766
"Look piya, the time
we spend together..."

642
01:14:23,105 --> 01:14:25,903
...was neither in
my hands nor yours.

643
01:14:27,510 --> 01:14:29,102
That is only a fantasy.

644
01:14:31,046 --> 01:14:32,843
You should cry over a fantasy.

645
01:14:34,550 --> 01:14:37,849
Remember the time
we spend together.

646
01:14:39,455 --> 01:14:43,050
"And when you will recall that
time, you will only smile."

647
01:14:46,729 --> 01:14:48,458
I cannot come back.

648
01:14:50,065 --> 01:14:52,727
Life is waiting for you
with open arms.

649
01:14:56,572 --> 01:15:00,531
I know you cannot forget me.

650
01:15:01,677 --> 01:15:06,740
But remember me in such a
manner that i help you survive.

651
01:15:13,088 --> 01:15:14,749
"You like him, don't you?"

652
01:15:15,691 --> 01:15:17,090
Even i like him.

653
01:15:35,742 --> 01:15:37,767
I knew this nasty man
would give us an appointment.

654
01:15:39,278 --> 01:15:40,939
I had written such
a letter to him.

655
01:15:45,685 --> 01:15:48,813
He is really nasty. He has
given an appointment for 10 am.

656
01:15:48,955 --> 01:15:50,616
And it is a five
hour drive from here.

657
01:15:51,791 --> 01:15:53,281
You'll have to leave at 5 am.

658
01:15:53,459 --> 01:15:54,892
"Miss piya,
i'll leave right now."

659
01:15:55,061 --> 01:15:58,394
"But once this man is convinced,
he'll give us several orders."

660
01:15:58,731 --> 01:16:00,221
You were uselessly
losing courage.

661
01:16:00,900 --> 01:16:02,390
That he won't even meet us.

662
01:16:02,568 --> 01:16:04,058
"If you want, you
can lay a bet with me."

663
01:16:04,570 --> 01:16:05,730
That he'll give
the orders to us.

664
01:16:06,906 --> 01:16:08,396
Really.

665
01:16:26,259 --> 01:16:30,093
"One does not behave like
this, if he's not in love."

666
01:16:31,063 --> 01:16:33,588
You are always lost
in your thoughts.

667
01:16:33,933 --> 01:16:36,094
"Once the girl is mentioned,
your mood changes."

668
01:16:36,769 --> 01:16:38,737
Shall i tell you the truth?

669
01:16:39,272 --> 01:16:41,604
You have fallen in love!

670
01:16:42,942 --> 01:16:44,933
Don't start talking
in punjabi when drunk.

671
01:16:45,945 --> 01:16:48,277
Whether i speak in
punjabi after drinking...

672
01:16:48,447 --> 01:16:52,008
"...or drink before speaking
punjabi, you don't interrupt me."

673
01:16:52,118 --> 01:16:54,484
- Understand? - alright.
- Now hear hindi.

674
01:16:55,054 --> 01:16:58,319
"You will not accept it, but you
have fallen in love with piya."

675
01:16:59,058 --> 01:17:00,548
- Don't talk nonsense!
- Who are you hiding it from?

676
01:17:00,726 --> 01:17:03,217
From me? But you cannot
hide it from yourself.

677
01:17:04,897 --> 01:17:07,559
"Sometimes, someone's else's
fate helps your destiny."

678
01:17:09,001 --> 01:17:11,231
- What do you mean?
- I am talking about shekhar.

679
01:17:11,704 --> 01:17:13,569
You didn't want to
appoint him at all.

680
01:17:13,906 --> 01:17:17,034
- Now his fate has...
- not fate.

681
01:17:19,579 --> 01:17:22,070
"Shekhar is so hard
working and determined..."

682
01:17:22,582 --> 01:17:24,516
...that perhaps he doesn't
need the help of good fate.

683
01:17:25,251 --> 01:17:26,741
And the best thing is that...

684
01:17:27,019 --> 01:17:28,577
...that he had very
noble intentions.

685
01:17:29,055 --> 01:17:31,922
He always wants the entire
world around him to be happy.

686
01:17:33,659 --> 01:17:35,593
Such people are
very hard to find.

687
01:17:36,929 --> 01:17:40,262
"After amar, that office
seemed such that..."

688
01:17:40,366 --> 01:17:41,924
...i didn't have the
courage to enter it.

689
01:17:43,603 --> 01:17:46,936
"But today, i feel like
giving that office a new look."

690
01:17:47,607 --> 01:17:48,767
I want to take it
in a new direction.

691
01:17:50,610 --> 01:17:52,942
When will you start thinking
like this about your life?

692
01:17:54,547 --> 01:17:58,381
- How? - that you give
your life a beautiful turn.

693
01:18:02,889 --> 01:18:04,550
Do you like shekhar?

694
01:18:07,560 --> 01:18:10,222
He's a nice boy.
Think about it.

695
01:18:17,036 --> 01:18:19,561
It is after so long that
i am seeing you happy.

696
01:18:30,583 --> 01:18:32,073
What happened?
You look tired.

697
01:18:33,586 --> 01:18:35,076
No.

698
01:18:39,058 --> 01:18:41,754
'The boss kept fighting
till late at night, so..."

699
01:18:42,595 --> 01:18:44,085
why?

700
01:18:45,598 --> 01:18:47,088
"No, nothing."

701
01:18:58,544 --> 01:19:02,708
'Since i have seen you... '

702
01:19:03,082 --> 01:19:06,711
'... my heart is
lost in your thoughts'

703
01:19:07,720 --> 01:19:11,884
'what is it
that my heart... '

704
01:19:12,391 --> 01:19:16,384
'... is saying to my heartbeats'

705
01:19:16,996 --> 01:19:20,727
'i am falling in love'

706
01:19:21,100 --> 01:19:25,059
'i had to lose my heart
i am losing i

707
01:19:35,581 --> 01:19:39,677
'what are people saying'

708
01:19:40,086 --> 01:19:44,580
'i have started wondering'

709
01:20:25,898 --> 01:20:29,732
'what is the truth about me... '

710
01:20:30,569 --> 01:20:34,562
'what shall i tell you'

711
01:20:49,055 --> 01:20:52,923
'who am i... '

712
01:20:53,592 --> 01:20:57,858
'how long shall i hide this'

713
01:20:58,664 --> 01:21:02,691
'how much ever you
may hide from me... '

714
01:21:03,202 --> 01:21:07,536
'... i still know everything'

715
01:21:08,007 --> 01:21:12,205
'everybody will
tomorrow know... '

716
01:21:12,545 --> 01:21:16,709
'... about our love'

717
01:22:15,040 --> 01:22:16,530
- i had given the appointment...
- you are...

718
01:22:16,742 --> 01:22:18,209
you misunderstand.
I am not abhigyan.

719
01:22:36,061 --> 01:22:39,553
'This year, our company's turn-
over is 800 million dollars."

720
01:22:41,066 --> 01:22:44,558
"Compared to last year,
125 o/o growth."

721
01:23:10,062 --> 01:23:13,361
"Uncle, how many zeros
does 800 million have?"

722
01:23:14,066 --> 01:23:17,035
- Why?
- Have you ever noticed?

723
01:23:18,003 --> 01:23:20,369
'The bigger the bank
account figure becomes..."

724
01:23:21,040 --> 01:23:22,735
...life becomes ionelier.

725
01:23:24,143 --> 01:23:27,874
Nothing except work.

726
01:23:29,114 --> 01:23:30,877
"And then, stability is needed."

727
01:23:31,717 --> 01:23:34,550
"A stage, where life begins."

728
01:24:03,649 --> 01:24:06,174
Uncle... life!

729
01:24:12,024 --> 01:24:13,514
Had i not told you that...

730
01:24:13,859 --> 01:24:19,695
"...amid this hard work, life
will itself come to me one day."

731
01:24:21,033 --> 01:24:22,864
"Now, if life will carry
me away with it..."

732
01:24:23,869 --> 01:24:26,531
"...it is life's fault, not mine."

733
01:24:27,539 --> 01:24:29,871
And i hope life
will carry me away!

734
01:24:58,570 --> 01:25:00,231
And miss piya is
our managing director.

735
01:25:02,107 --> 01:25:03,734
- My name isn't very bad.
- What?

736
01:25:07,913 --> 01:25:10,746
We have studied your buying
pattern of the past five years.

737
01:25:29,501 --> 01:25:31,128
And one funny thing
we noticed is that...

738
01:25:31,603 --> 01:25:34,766
...after purchasing the material
you dispatched it within 10 days.

739
01:25:39,678 --> 01:25:41,771
"You purchased all the material
during the peak season..."

740
01:25:42,114 --> 01:25:44,446
...when the material
costs the most.

741
01:25:45,617 --> 01:25:48,279
"If you had purchased this
material during off season..."

742
01:25:48,954 --> 01:25:51,946
...it would cost you
about 25 o/o less.

743
01:25:54,226 --> 01:25:55,716
"Abhi, i only
want to say that..."

744
01:25:55,894 --> 01:25:57,555
"...whether anyone else offers
you this price or not..."

745
01:25:58,564 --> 01:26:00,896
...we want to offer this
off season price to you.

746
01:26:06,905 --> 01:26:08,896
You study our project report.

747
01:26:09,742 --> 01:26:12,905
And consider adding us
to your vendor's list.

748
01:26:24,590 --> 01:26:27,184
I have never come across such
a prepared supplier before.

749
01:26:34,600 --> 01:26:37,091
'That company may not be
doing very well today..."

750
01:26:38,737 --> 01:26:41,103
...but we can start with them
by giving them a small order.

751
01:26:43,942 --> 01:26:48,072
I think piya is the
girl who i was looking for.

752
01:26:49,948 --> 01:26:53,281
I want to know in detail about
shah industries and piya.

753
01:26:53,952 --> 01:26:56,716
I know everything about
that company and that family.

754
01:27:21,246 --> 01:27:22,907
"Calgary is a good
place, isn't it?"

755
01:27:23,582 --> 01:27:25,413
Calgary has always
been a good place.

756
01:27:26,585 --> 01:27:28,746
"No, uncle. It is
seeming better today."

757
01:27:29,254 --> 01:27:31,449
Why? Because piya lives here?

758
01:27:32,257 --> 01:27:34,589
Really? Piya lives in calgary?

759
01:27:46,071 --> 01:27:48,266
I want to open an
office in calgary.

760
01:27:48,941 --> 01:27:53,776
"Sure we will, son. But before
you think more about piya..."

761
01:27:54,546 --> 01:27:56,537
...i would like to know
who this shekhar is.

762
01:27:59,051 --> 01:28:01,042
"Yes, sir. One minute."

763
01:28:03,622 --> 01:28:05,146
Has our quotation reached you?

764
01:28:07,125 --> 01:28:08,615
One minute. Piya.

765
01:28:21,707 --> 01:28:24,403
Really? Congratulations.

766
01:28:29,047 --> 01:28:31,743
"Yes, we will surely come.
I will tell shekhar."

767
01:28:38,090 --> 01:28:39,580
He is opening an
office in calgary.

768
01:28:40,158 --> 01:28:42,092
He has thrown a party and
has invited us both to it.

769
01:28:56,041 --> 01:28:58,032
Is good that you have come.
I was waiting for you.

770
01:29:13,559 --> 01:29:15,049
"Some faces are simply
so lovable, right?"

771
01:29:21,900 --> 01:29:23,390
"You love piya, don't you?"

772
01:29:24,236 --> 01:29:26,727
"No, i don't."

773
01:30:08,113 --> 01:30:11,879
'Her beauty is stunning
i am losing my senses'

774
01:30:12,050 --> 01:30:14,211
'my heart is singing in joy'

775
01:30:25,731 --> 01:30:29,394
'i am looking at her
she doesn't know i

776
01:30:33,405 --> 01:30:35,566
'i am falling in love with her'

777
01:31:14,546 --> 01:31:18,038
'my life was not
so restless earlier'

778
01:31:18,283 --> 01:31:21,878
'wonder why i
sometimes feel that... '

779
01:31:22,087 --> 01:31:25,887
'... i don't want to be ionely
but she is not with me'

780
01:31:26,058 --> 01:31:29,721
'i can feel
her presence in my hear

781
01:31:30,162 --> 01:31:31,891
'don't ask what my condition is'

782
01:31:32,064 --> 01:31:33,725
'my heart is dancing today'

783
01:31:34,066 --> 01:31:37,126
'i may lose my senses'

784
01:31:47,512 --> 01:31:50,913
'her one look

785
01:31:51,083 --> 01:31:54,849
'wonder when
she came into my hear

786
01:31:55,020 --> 01:31:58,683
'i was ignorant till now
i have known today'

787
01:31:58,857 --> 01:32:02,691
'i am longing to make her mine'

788
01:32:03,061 --> 01:32:04,722
'my heart has recognized her'

789
01:32:05,030 --> 01:32:06,691
'i know her'

790
01:32:07,032 --> 01:32:09,865
'someone go and tell her this'

791
01:33:13,865 --> 01:33:15,526
will someone tell me
what the problem is?

792
01:33:15,867 --> 01:33:17,357
I am talking to you!

793
01:33:25,010 --> 01:33:27,103
You had told me that
abhigyan is a nice man.

794
01:33:27,546 --> 01:33:29,036
You had told me
he is a rich man.

795
01:33:29,147 --> 01:33:31,877
"And the most important, you also
told me that he loves piya."

796
01:33:32,050 --> 01:33:35,486
Then what is the cause of
your anger and dejection?

797
01:33:35,887 --> 01:33:38,048
"- Tell me.
- Yes, i had told you!"

798
01:33:38,557 --> 01:33:40,548
I had told you that
abhigyan is a nice man.

799
01:33:40,725 --> 01:33:42,158
I had said that he is rich.

800
01:33:42,627 --> 01:33:45,562
I had also said
that he loves piya.

801
01:33:47,566 --> 01:33:49,557
"But one thing that
i didn't tell you..."

802
01:33:50,735 --> 01:33:54,171
...is that i love piya too.

803
01:33:58,510 --> 01:34:00,000
I love piya.

804
01:34:04,015 --> 01:34:07,007
And the reason for this
anger and dejection is that...

805
01:34:07,853 --> 01:34:10,048
"...how much ever i may love
her, i could never tell her..."

806
01:34:10,689 --> 01:34:12,179
...that i love her.

807
01:34:13,859 --> 01:34:15,520
Because this time i will
not tell her the half truth.

808
01:34:15,694 --> 01:34:17,184
This time i will tell
her the complete truth.

809
01:34:17,863 --> 01:34:20,696
I will also say that
i caused amar's death.

810
01:34:24,536 --> 01:34:29,872
"Bosco, i will never be able
to tell her that i love her."

811
01:34:30,876 --> 01:34:32,366
And what if she says it?

812
01:34:34,546 --> 01:34:36,707
That day will be wonderful!

813
01:34:37,883 --> 01:34:43,446
"I cannot say yes,
and i won't be able to say no."

814
01:34:56,568 --> 01:35:01,904
These emotions are so stupid.

815
01:35:04,109 --> 01:35:07,237
They don't have
any sense of logic.

816
01:35:09,714 --> 01:35:13,582
- What happened now?
- It is so simple.

817
01:35:14,586 --> 01:35:18,818
"Right now, there's no better
option for piya than abhi."

818
01:35:21,493 --> 01:35:27,261
Wonder why we are
uselessly arguing.

819
01:35:48,119 --> 01:35:49,609
- Coming! - hurry!

820
01:35:50,088 --> 01:35:51,612
How much you shout!

821
01:35:58,063 --> 01:35:59,894
- Les go.
- Are you ready?

822
01:36:00,065 --> 01:36:02,727
'Wait! I am going
downtown, mummy."

823
01:36:02,901 --> 01:36:04,391
- I'll back in around 2 hours.
- Hurry up.

824
01:36:08,907 --> 01:36:12,343
- What happened? - isn't the
meeting with abhi at 2 pm today?

825
01:36:12,577 --> 01:36:14,067
"Yes, you have to go."

826
01:36:15,747 --> 01:36:18,807
- Both of us have to go.
- I spoke to abhi last night.

827
01:36:19,084 --> 01:36:21,245
I had asked him if it
was okay if only you go.

828
01:36:21,586 --> 01:36:24,919
Is not okay. And you should
have asked me before asking him.

829
01:36:25,156 --> 01:36:26,646
Didn't i ask you?

830
01:36:28,159 --> 01:36:31,253
"Shekhar, what has happened to
you? Go and get ready fast now."

831
01:36:32,397 --> 01:36:36,766
"Look, i have promised mili
that we'll go for cycling."

832
01:36:40,772 --> 01:36:42,262
Nobody will go for cycling.

833
01:36:42,607 --> 01:36:45,098
Now kindly go and get ready!
Abhi will come now.

834
01:36:45,944 --> 01:36:47,844
'We will have to go, or else
mili will be heartbroken."

835
01:36:47,946 --> 01:36:50,278
"- Go, shekhar, hurry up!
- Please. - he's come!"

836
01:36:50,615 --> 01:36:52,105
What shall i do now?

837
01:36:57,989 --> 01:37:01,550
"- So, you are going cycling
today? - Yes, just like that."

838
01:37:04,062 --> 01:37:07,054
- Shall we go?
- Les go.

839
01:37:22,914 --> 01:37:24,404
"Shall we go, mili?"

840
01:37:27,919 --> 01:37:29,409
"Les go, mili!"

841
01:37:30,922 --> 01:37:33,482
- What happened?
- Why did you lie?

842
01:37:34,592 --> 01:37:38,585
- When did i lie? - you had
yourself planned to go cycling.

843
01:37:38,797 --> 01:37:40,924
And you told her that
you had promised me?

844
01:37:41,933 --> 01:37:44,265
- Hadn't i promised?
- Don't lie.

845
01:37:44,602 --> 01:37:47,264
One must not lie to a
woman. One gets caught.

846
01:37:47,605 --> 01:37:49,596
"Really? So, you've
become a woman?"

847
01:37:50,608 --> 01:37:52,269
"Actually, i wanted just
the two of them to go."

848
01:37:52,944 --> 01:37:54,536
Thas why. Les go.

849
01:38:04,889 --> 01:38:07,551
Do you also feel
that abhi loves piya?

850
01:38:08,560 --> 01:38:10,221
"- Yes, maybe.
- And piya?"

851
01:38:11,563 --> 01:38:13,053
I don't know.

852
01:38:15,567 --> 01:38:17,899
Is it that you love piya too?

853
01:38:21,172 --> 01:38:22,696
'The gear got stuck.
Come, les go."

854
01:38:34,085 --> 01:38:35,575
Where are you going?

855
01:38:36,087 --> 01:38:37,577
'The office is
in downtown, right?"

856
01:38:39,924 --> 01:38:42,757
Shall i tell you something?
We don't have nay meeting today.

857
01:38:44,129 --> 01:38:46,723
I want to take
you to see my house.

858
01:38:49,734 --> 01:38:55,536
- Are you offended?
- Yes.

859
01:38:57,876 --> 01:39:00,709
"I have not met you often,
but i do understand you."

860
01:39:02,046 --> 01:39:04,879
"Six years ago, i
was exactly like this."

861
01:39:05,550 --> 01:39:07,040
I wanted to win
the entire world.

862
01:39:07,218 --> 01:39:08,879
I was a workaholic.

863
01:39:09,554 --> 01:39:11,715
I didn't realize
how the years went by.

864
01:39:12,891 --> 01:39:15,018
I was over worked
these last six years.

865
01:39:15,560 --> 01:39:17,721
I am seeing all that
happening with you.

866
01:39:19,564 --> 01:39:23,056
The desire to take back shah
industries to its earlier glory.

867
01:39:26,905 --> 01:39:28,395
I know everything.

868
01:39:32,577 --> 01:39:34,067
"Piya, this is
a strange phenomena."

869
01:39:34,579 --> 01:39:37,571
Work and life constantly
fight with each other.

870
01:39:38,082 --> 01:39:39,640
"And in the end, death wins!"

871
01:39:40,585 --> 01:39:42,746
"Both, life and work, lose!"

872
01:39:44,722 --> 01:39:47,247
"After losing six years,
i have only understood that..."

873
01:39:48,059 --> 01:39:50,926
"...i had should have taken out
time for myself, in that fight."

874
01:39:52,096 --> 01:39:55,031
"Anyway, i couldn't,
but i want you to."

875
01:39:56,868 --> 01:39:59,029
Sometimes! Without any reason.

876
01:40:00,438 --> 01:40:02,030
"I am sorry, i lied to you."

877
01:40:03,007 --> 01:40:07,535
But i just did that so that you
spare some time for yourself.

878
01:40:10,215 --> 01:40:11,705
Shall we go back?

879
01:40:15,887 --> 01:40:17,445
You wanted to
show me your house.

880
01:40:20,892 --> 01:40:24,555
Piya's a very nice girl. I hope
she finds herself a nice man.

881
01:40:24,729 --> 01:40:26,219
We are very worried about her.

882
01:40:27,899 --> 01:40:30,231
"Grandma, you are always
worried about others!"

883
01:40:30,902 --> 01:40:32,392
Don't you ever
worry about yourself?

884
01:40:32,904 --> 01:40:35,236
I am okay.
I am not so nice.

885
01:40:35,573 --> 01:40:37,063
I will find many men.

886
01:40:37,375 --> 01:40:42,403
Who says you are okay?
You are the best!

887
01:40:43,715 --> 01:40:45,580
You are the second
person who has said this.

888
01:40:46,718 --> 01:40:49,243
- Who was the first?
- Brother amar.

889
01:40:57,195 --> 01:40:58,685
Will you make me your brother?

890
01:41:02,033 --> 01:41:03,523
I already have.

891
01:41:11,876 --> 01:41:14,344
These are my parents.
They live in chicago.

892
01:41:14,545 --> 01:41:16,536
I surely go to meet
them once a month.

893
01:41:17,081 --> 01:41:19,379
"And everytime, they show me
the picture of a new girl..."

894
01:41:19,550 --> 01:41:21,211
...and waste the whole
evening on that topic.

895
01:41:22,053 --> 01:41:26,046
- And you? - i? I
explain to them that...

896
01:41:26,124 --> 01:41:27,614
...she cannot be searched for.

897
01:41:28,893 --> 01:41:32,226
"She will suddenly present
herself before me one day..."

898
01:41:32,630 --> 01:41:36,066
...and happiness will follow.

899
01:41:37,902 --> 01:41:40,234
'Thas true. But as
soon as you'll find her..."

900
01:41:40,571 --> 01:41:42,061
...don't be too late.

901
01:41:42,573 --> 01:41:46,031
"You are such a nice man, she
will not be able to refuse."

902
01:41:48,579 --> 01:41:51,912
Just approach her with
an engagement ring!

903
01:41:53,084 --> 01:41:54,915
Get married to her!

904
01:42:13,871 --> 01:42:15,702
"- Shall we go.
- Yes, les go."

905
01:42:19,043 --> 01:42:23,207
"Actually, you...
no, you proceed."

906
01:42:23,681 --> 01:42:25,273
I have some more work.

907
01:42:25,616 --> 01:42:27,709
Do it tomorrow.
I will help you with it.

908
01:42:28,553 --> 01:42:32,387
How much will you help me?
Let me also do something.

909
01:42:34,692 --> 01:42:37,718
It will just take about an
hour or so. I'll go later.

910
01:43:56,841 --> 01:43:59,366
"- Sir, you are not being fair.
- To whom?"

911
01:43:59,510 --> 01:44:01,000
To yourself.

912
01:44:02,013 --> 01:44:05,676
"I have told you to stick to
your job, not to interfere."

913
01:44:06,017 --> 01:44:09,919
I'm doing that. Beji sent me
from london to take care of you.

914
01:44:10,021 --> 01:44:11,682
"Look, beji has gone insane."

915
01:44:12,023 --> 01:44:16,687
"And where you are concerned, you
look like you are born foolish!"

916
01:44:16,861 --> 01:44:19,625
"- You are insulting me.
- Yes, i intended to."

917
01:44:27,205 --> 01:44:28,866
- What are you doing?
- I have felt offended.

918
01:44:30,541 --> 01:44:33,635
You continue to feel offended.
I will go and meet ayesha.

919
01:44:37,081 --> 01:44:39,015
What happened?
You were offended.

920
01:44:39,083 --> 01:44:41,347
"Yes, but i cannot afford
to be offended right now."

921
01:44:41,552 --> 01:44:43,213
This madam is very famous.

922
01:44:43,421 --> 01:44:45,889
"- She is... - if you'll say one
more word against ayesha..."

923
01:44:46,557 --> 01:44:49,549
- i'll pull out your eyes!
- You are strange!

924
01:44:49,894 --> 01:44:51,885
'The words will come from my
mouth, & you'll pull my eyes!"

925
01:44:52,063 --> 01:44:55,726
"Yes, it depends on my
mood, what i want to say."

926
01:44:55,900 --> 01:44:58,664
Stupid! You would understand
if you had ever fallen in love.

927
01:45:02,006 --> 01:45:08,036
"Love! You call what she
is doing with you, love?"

928
01:45:08,246 --> 01:45:10,908
This is fraud!
Total nonsense!

929
01:45:11,182 --> 01:45:16,586
Love is an emotion which
is felt from the heart.

930
01:45:16,754 --> 01:45:18,688
Come out of your dream world.

931
01:45:19,190 --> 01:45:23,251
"A beautiful spirit, and face."

932
01:45:23,594 --> 01:45:25,585
"- What? - When you
look into her eyes..."

933
01:45:25,930 --> 01:45:27,761
...you should be
able to see heaven!

934
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:32,433
But why am i wasting
my time with this fool?

935
01:45:35,673 --> 01:45:39,200
"- Yes, a fool!
- Yes, a fool!"

936
01:45:40,945 --> 01:45:42,435
You wait here.

937
01:46:02,567 --> 01:46:06,901
What is the matter?
You look very tense.

938
01:46:07,905 --> 01:46:12,569
"I am tense, and normally my
face never reflects my emotions."

939
01:46:12,677 --> 01:46:15,669
- Right! - i am
very worried about piya.

940
01:46:15,913 --> 01:46:17,403
Really?

941
01:46:18,916 --> 01:46:21,578
- What happened to piya? - she
didn't return home all night.

942
01:46:21,919 --> 01:46:24,251
She came at 7 o'clock
and left again at 8 o'clock.

943
01:46:25,256 --> 01:46:27,417
"If she works so hard,
won't she fall sick?"

944
01:46:27,925 --> 01:46:31,417
"Yes, but how do you
know that she was working?"

945
01:46:32,597 --> 01:46:37,432
It is possible that even
she has fallen in love.

946
01:47:16,574 --> 01:47:18,132
Help! My tie!

947
01:47:19,910 --> 01:47:22,071
You are unnecessarily
getting so worried.

948
01:47:22,146 --> 01:47:25,775
Call her up and talk to her.
Ask her where and how she is.

949
01:47:29,253 --> 01:47:31,312
You are so smart.

950
01:47:31,589 --> 01:47:33,079
You think of so much.

951
01:47:33,591 --> 01:47:35,786
Mr. Somako is saying that
this is a very big order.

952
01:47:35,926 --> 01:47:39,657
"And more than quality, you'll
pay personal attention to this."

953
01:47:42,099 --> 01:47:43,726
It has been our
company's policy...

954
01:47:43,834 --> 01:47:46,928
...to satisfy all our customers
with personal attention.

955
01:47:56,047 --> 01:47:58,277
She disconnected my call. Mine!

956
01:47:59,150 --> 01:48:00,708
Maybe she is busy in a meeting.

957
01:48:04,488 --> 01:48:07,321
"- You fool?!
- A beautiful face, sir."

958
01:48:08,159 --> 01:48:11,720
And the spirit!
Mind blowing!

959
01:48:32,583 --> 01:48:34,073
What happened?!

960
01:48:36,153 --> 01:48:37,643
Tell me what happened!

961
01:48:42,093 --> 01:48:43,583
What are you doing?

962
01:48:45,763 --> 01:48:47,754
- What happened?
- Do you know what happened?

963
01:48:47,932 --> 01:48:49,763
"Look, what has happened!"

964
01:48:52,603 --> 01:48:55,868
This is only a ring.
What are you crying for?

965
01:48:57,041 --> 01:48:59,703
Lfti wants to marry me!

966
01:49:01,712 --> 01:49:05,045
- And you? - even i want to!

967
01:49:40,918 --> 01:49:43,580
'The nights... '

968
01:49:46,090 --> 01:49:48,923
'... grow longer'

969
01:49:56,867 --> 01:50:01,861
'the nights grow longer'

970
01:50:02,206 --> 01:50:06,870
'suddenly one becomes sleepless'

971
01:50:07,545 --> 01:50:12,710
'the heart becomes restless
one starts waiting for someone'

972
01:50:13,217 --> 01:50:17,711
'when someone falls in love'

973
01:51:39,069 --> 01:51:43,904
'i have become crazy'

974
01:51:44,375 --> 01:51:47,742
'don't ask me what i wan

975
01:51:49,914 --> 01:51:54,681
'i have come into your arms'

976
01:51:55,052 --> 01:51:58,510
'i have found heaven
in your arms'

977
01:52:00,524 --> 01:52:03,015
'my heart is blooming
like a flower'

978
01:52:03,193 --> 01:52:05,855
'i have touched you
and lost my senses'

979
01:52:06,030 --> 01:52:11,195
'the heart is always restless'

980
01:52:11,535 --> 01:52:16,199
'when someone falls in love'

981
01:52:59,850 --> 01:53:04,514
'this heart soars like a birï

982
01:53:04,989 --> 01:53:08,356
'when one's dreams
are fulfilleï

983
01:53:10,527 --> 01:53:15,362
'dreams are just dreams'

984
01:53:15,666 --> 01:53:19,363
'they can never be our own'

985
01:53:21,038 --> 01:53:23,700
'one dreams even with open eyes'

986
01:53:23,874 --> 01:53:26,365
'when one finds true love'

987
01:53:26,543 --> 01:53:31,879
'one loses control on the heart
and cannot control oneself'

988
01:53:32,116 --> 01:53:36,712
'when someone falls in love'

989
01:54:41,018 --> 01:54:43,987
"since the last three months, our
installments are reaching timely."

990
01:54:44,555 --> 01:54:46,045
The bank is also
very happy with us.

991
01:54:46,890 --> 01:54:50,223
"At this rate, we will pay
off the loan in 10 years."

992
01:54:53,063 --> 01:54:55,429
- 10 years?! - yes.

993
01:54:55,899 --> 01:54:58,231
- It will take another 10 years?
- Yes.

994
01:55:03,507 --> 01:55:06,305
Wish god would present
me with some money.

995
01:55:08,078 --> 01:55:11,741
And would tell me
to pay off the loan.

996
01:55:13,083 --> 01:55:15,108
So that i could
free shah industries.

997
01:55:32,936 --> 01:55:38,602
"It must feel so good, to
work hard for small needs."

998
01:55:41,111 --> 01:55:44,945
I have so much and no
one to share it with.

999
01:55:47,618 --> 01:55:49,085
"Uncle, i want to marry piya."

1000
01:55:50,621 --> 01:55:52,953
It will be better if
you tell that to piya.

1001
01:55:54,992 --> 01:55:59,224
"She said, i should approach the
girl with an engagement ring."

1002
01:56:00,063 --> 01:56:02,224
And i should marry that girl!

1003
01:56:05,702 --> 01:56:07,294
I don't have the courage
to tell her that now.

1004
01:56:08,572 --> 01:56:10,062
She won't agree.

1005
01:56:10,574 --> 01:56:12,906
She wants to pay off all
of shah industries loan first.

1006
01:56:13,911 --> 01:56:17,074
And it may be too late by then.

1007
01:56:17,347 --> 01:56:20,748
It will be! Is it not
possible that we help her?

1008
01:56:22,252 --> 01:56:23,742
"It is very simple, piya."

1009
01:56:24,521 --> 01:56:28,252
The price of the shares of shah
industries is not very high now.

1010
01:56:29,760 --> 01:56:31,250
That is only because...

1011
01:56:32,062 --> 01:56:33,927
...the company is not doing
well since the last one year.

1012
01:56:34,932 --> 01:56:37,093
That is why the company had
to take a loan from the bank.

1013
01:56:38,602 --> 01:56:40,092
My offer is that...

1014
01:56:40,437 --> 01:56:42,769
...i will purchase 40 o/o
shares of shah industries.

1015
01:56:43,941 --> 01:56:45,772
This will have two advantages.

1016
01:56:45,842 --> 01:56:48,606
"One, because of my company's
reputation in the market..."

1017
01:56:49,213 --> 01:56:53,115
...the share value of shah
industries will increase.

1018
01:56:54,685 --> 01:56:58,985
"Secondly, the money you
will get for the 40 o/o stake..."

1019
01:56:59,890 --> 01:57:01,687
...you can pay off
your bank loan with it.

1020
01:57:11,902 --> 01:57:13,631
'Why will you do that, when..."

1021
01:57:13,904 --> 01:57:16,395
"...today, no one wants to buy
the shares of shah industries."

1022
01:57:18,909 --> 01:57:20,399
I'm also into investment.

1023
01:57:21,578 --> 01:57:25,742
"I have complete faith in you, in
shekhar & in shah industries."

1024
01:57:27,084 --> 01:57:31,077
"If shah industries needs
anything today..."

1025
01:57:31,588 --> 01:57:33,078
...it is money.

1026
01:57:33,724 --> 01:57:37,751
"And once the money comes in, the
share price will go so high..."

1027
01:57:38,595 --> 01:57:40,085
...that i will surely profit.

1028
01:57:40,597 --> 01:57:42,588
"And you can buy back
your shares, if you want."

1029
01:57:52,943 --> 01:57:54,877
I have given a lot of
thought to this proposal.

1030
01:57:55,879 --> 01:57:59,371
- And i think it is a
very good offer. - Yes.

1031
01:58:00,550 --> 01:58:02,040
But i want opinions
from all of you.

1032
01:58:02,886 --> 01:58:05,878
"Piya, mr. Girdhari had
started shah industries."

1033
01:58:06,556 --> 01:58:08,717
Then amar managed it
very well after him.

1034
01:58:09,059 --> 01:58:11,550
'Today, you and shekhar
are running it."

1035
01:58:12,396 --> 01:58:13,886
"Before giving my opinion..."

1036
01:58:13,997 --> 01:58:15,897
...we would like to take
even shekhar's opinion.

1037
01:58:34,318 --> 01:58:36,752
I am very thankful
to mr. Abhigyan...

1038
01:58:37,187 --> 01:58:39,246
...for having so much
faith on shah industries.

1039
01:58:40,590 --> 01:58:44,583
I am grateful that you
want to know my opinion.

1040
01:58:46,596 --> 01:58:49,258
I knew about this
proposal last night.

1041
01:58:51,068 --> 01:58:53,593
'Though i have no right..."

1042
01:58:54,604 --> 01:58:56,196
...yet i thought about
it late into the night.

1043
01:58:57,874 --> 01:59:00,707
I thought about what shah
industries really is.

1044
01:59:02,879 --> 01:59:05,040
"About 35 years ago..."

1045
01:59:05,982 --> 01:59:08,712
...mr. Girdharilal shah
came to canada from bombay.

1046
01:59:11,555 --> 01:59:13,045
You all became friends.

1047
01:59:13,557 --> 01:59:15,047
"And then, like a family."

1048
01:59:15,892 --> 01:59:17,951
Then this family
decided to do something.

1049
01:59:18,895 --> 01:59:20,886
"And hence, shah
industries was born!"

1050
01:59:22,566 --> 01:59:24,227
"As far as i know..."

1051
01:59:25,302 --> 01:59:27,998
...you all had decided that...

1052
01:59:28,905 --> 01:59:32,068
"...whether good or bad,
big or small..."

1053
01:59:33,143 --> 01:59:35,703
...shah industries would
remain within this family.

1054
01:59:36,313 --> 01:59:38,406
No outsider will
be allowed into it.

1055
01:59:40,250 --> 01:59:43,242
'Today, shah industries
desperately needs money."

1056
01:59:43,587 --> 01:59:45,248
"And if i'll listen
to my mind..."

1057
01:59:45,655 --> 01:59:48,590
...perhaps i will immediately
accept mr. Abhigyan's offer.

1058
01:59:49,593 --> 01:59:51,083
But i don't have this right.

1059
01:59:51,728 --> 01:59:55,528
"Because i have not made shah
industries, you have made it."

1060
01:59:57,534 --> 01:59:59,866
"And if i am understanding
your emotions correctly..."

1061
02:00:02,038 --> 02:00:04,598
...then you still have complete
faith on shah industries.

1062
02:00:05,876 --> 02:00:08,037
You still believe that
everything will be fine.

1063
02:00:09,546 --> 02:00:11,036
"In fact, all of you want..."

1064
02:00:11,415 --> 02:00:15,215
...shah industries to pass this
bad phase & stand on its feet!

1065
02:00:27,898 --> 02:00:31,732
I want to remind all of you that
i'd only asked for your opinion.

1066
02:00:33,904 --> 02:00:36,236
"And as managing director..."

1067
02:00:36,573 --> 02:00:39,235
...i want to inform all
you share holders...

1068
02:00:39,576 --> 02:00:41,908
...that i have
accepted this proposal.

1069
02:00:43,580 --> 02:00:45,411
How can she do it?!

1070
02:00:45,582 --> 02:00:47,345
And i will sign
the papers tomorrow.

1071
02:01:39,069 --> 02:01:40,559
"Did you call me, piya?"

1072
02:01:45,575 --> 02:01:47,065
'Why did you do it, shekhar?"

1073
02:01:49,079 --> 02:01:50,569
I just gave my opinion.

1074
02:01:52,582 --> 02:01:54,174
Even if that opinion
may go against me?

1075
02:01:55,519 --> 02:01:57,180
"Piya, you probably
did not notice..."

1076
02:01:57,521 --> 02:02:00,183
...but every person present
there was against your decision.

1077
02:02:00,857 --> 02:02:03,189
'Whatever i'm doing, is for
the benefit of the company."

1078
02:02:06,530 --> 02:02:08,521
"You were fighting earlier too,
for the company's benefit."

1079
02:02:09,032 --> 02:02:11,193
Alone! Even i was
not with you then.

1080
02:02:11,535 --> 02:02:13,730
"But the decision that
you have taken today..."

1081
02:02:13,870 --> 02:02:17,101
...was taken by leaving many
company associates behind.

1082
02:02:18,708 --> 02:02:20,198
"Me, too."

1083
02:02:20,544 --> 02:02:23,877
I want shah industries in
the same position as before.

1084
02:02:25,148 --> 02:02:26,638
At any cost!

1085
02:02:28,218 --> 02:02:29,981
"You can give me your
support, if you want."

1086
02:02:33,056 --> 02:02:35,354
"And if you want, you can
leave me alone and go."

1087
02:02:51,241 --> 02:02:52,731
Remember one thing.

1088
02:02:55,011 --> 02:02:57,241
"One feels happy on reaching
one's destination, when..."

1089
02:02:57,847 --> 02:02:59,337
...one has friends with him.

1090
02:03:01,985 --> 02:03:05,682
"I am nothing, but if you
reach your destination..."

1091
02:03:06,523 --> 02:03:10,687
"...without father,
grandma, and mili..."

1092
02:03:12,696 --> 02:03:14,186
...everything will be pointless.

1093
02:03:15,865 --> 02:03:17,355
Useless!

1094
02:03:24,040 --> 02:03:25,530
I'll take your leave.

1095
02:03:38,054 --> 02:03:44,015
'One moment has captured... '

1096
02:03:44,694 --> 02:03:47,720
'... the journey of a lifetime'

1097
02:04:00,510 --> 02:04:06,847
'as if life may have... '

1098
02:04:07,017 --> 02:04:11,010
'... moved very fas

1099
02:04:25,135 --> 02:04:27,194
"so, you will leave
everything and go?"

1100
02:04:28,204 --> 02:04:30,866
- You have gone mad!
- Times are not in my favour.

1101
02:04:32,542 --> 02:04:35,375
"Look, shah industries
does not need me anymore."

1102
02:04:35,879 --> 02:04:37,369
And the shah family?

1103
02:04:38,548 --> 02:04:40,038
Abhi loves piya very much.

1104
02:04:41,151 --> 02:04:43,381
"Once they get married,
everything will be alright."

1105
02:04:43,553 --> 02:04:45,214
- And what about your love?
- Mine?

1106
02:04:48,558 --> 02:04:51,220
'Why, don't you love piya?"

1107
02:04:52,562 --> 02:04:54,052
Maybe this is my punishment.

1108
02:04:54,564 --> 02:04:57,055
My happiness lies
in her happiness.

1109
02:04:58,902 --> 02:05:03,236
"And if you love someone, it is
not necessary that you get her."

1110
02:05:32,602 --> 02:05:34,593
"Shekhar? Is me, piya."

1111
02:05:35,205 --> 02:05:36,695
"Pick the phone, shekhar."

1112
02:05:39,275 --> 02:05:41,106
"Is piya, shekhar.
Please pick up the phone."

1113
02:05:46,049 --> 02:05:49,109
"Look, i am at the merger.
I'm all alone. No one has come."

1114
02:05:49,619 --> 02:05:51,610
Even you did not come.
Please pick up the phone if...

1115
02:05:53,623 --> 02:05:56,558
"shekhar, you supported me
when i had lost all hope."

1116
02:05:58,161 --> 02:06:00,994
Then how can you
leave me alone today?

1117
02:06:12,575 --> 02:06:14,907
"You understand that i should
go away from here, right?"

1118
02:06:19,916 --> 02:06:21,406
I am your culprit.

1119
02:06:28,158 --> 02:06:32,652
"I used to think that if i
can help you in any way..."

1120
02:06:33,596 --> 02:06:35,086
...it will be my repentance.

1121
02:06:36,599 --> 02:06:41,593
But no. Maybe my punishment
is that i shouldn't help you.

1122
02:06:42,605 --> 02:06:45,597
That i do not get your love.

1123
02:06:50,113 --> 02:06:56,143
"I'll leave. If possible,
please forgive me."

1124
02:07:36,593 --> 02:07:38,083
Please embrace me once.

1125
02:07:46,603 --> 02:07:49,094
"- Where is mili? - We don't
know, she has gone out."

1126
02:07:50,440 --> 02:07:51,930
She has given this for you.

1127
02:08:00,049 --> 02:08:02,040
I thought i will not
be able to stop you.

1128
02:08:02,685 --> 02:08:04,983
And i couldn't
even see you going.

1129
02:08:06,022 --> 02:08:08,047
One feels very hurt
when a brother leaves.

1130
02:08:09,058 --> 02:08:10,889
I will never make
anyone my brother again.

1131
02:08:36,252 --> 02:08:37,742
What is the matter?

1132
02:08:38,588 --> 02:08:40,078
What do you think you are doing?

1133
02:08:41,591 --> 02:08:43,081
For whom are you doing this?

1134
02:08:43,593 --> 02:08:45,083
"You are not doing it
for yourself, right?"

1135
02:08:47,263 --> 02:08:49,823
Have you given a thought to
why you are alone here today?

1136
02:08:50,600 --> 02:08:53,262
'Why are father, grandma
me or mili not here?"

1137
02:08:54,037 --> 02:08:55,527
Why isn't shekhar here?

1138
02:08:58,875 --> 02:09:02,038
"Before shekhar came, all
of us were ready for this."

1139
02:09:02,879 --> 02:09:06,212
'That one of these days, the bank
will auction shah industries."

1140
02:09:08,217 --> 02:09:10,651
"Only after shekhar came, every
thing had begun to go right."

1141
02:09:12,155 --> 02:09:14,953
'Today, shekhar is
returning back to bombay."

1142
02:09:17,160 --> 02:09:19,219
You are snatching
a son from a father.

1143
02:09:21,030 --> 02:09:22,554
A brother from his sister.

1144
02:09:24,567 --> 02:09:28,401
"And my child, you are separating
that person from yourself..."

1145
02:09:29,906 --> 02:09:31,396
...whom you love.

1146
02:09:31,908 --> 02:09:34,741
Go and stop him! Or else...

1147
02:09:36,112 --> 02:09:39,047
...you will become as ionely
in life as you've never been!

1148
02:10:03,873 --> 02:10:10,711
'This is the pain of love'

1149
02:10:25,695 --> 02:10:30,394
'don't go away from my life'

1150
02:10:30,900 --> 02:10:33,232
'don't go'

1151
02:10:33,569 --> 02:10:35,400
'please don't go'

1152
02:11:53,249 --> 02:11:54,682
'wait, shekhar!"

1153
02:12:03,025 --> 02:12:04,515
'What do you think, shekhar?"

1154
02:12:05,528 --> 02:12:07,359
'That you can enter my
life whenever you like..."

1155
02:12:07,430 --> 02:12:08,954
...and leave me
whenever you want?

1156
02:12:10,533 --> 02:12:12,524
You won't ask me?
You won't even tell me?!

1157
02:12:14,203 --> 02:12:17,195
"Look piya, i am not
needed here now."

1158
02:12:17,373 --> 02:12:18,863
Who doesn't need you?

1159
02:12:19,876 --> 02:12:22,709
"Father, grandma, mili, or me?"

1160
02:12:23,546 --> 02:12:26,037
"No piya, shah
industries doesn't."

1161
02:12:29,085 --> 02:12:31,713
Does only shah industries
exist between you and me?

1162
02:12:38,227 --> 02:12:42,891
Have you ever tried to know if
i need you in my life or not?

1163
02:12:47,570 --> 02:12:49,401
Did you ever try to
find out that...

1164
02:12:50,339 --> 02:12:52,569
"...after amar's death,
if i tried to live again..."

1165
02:12:52,675 --> 02:12:54,108
...it was only because of you?!

1166
02:13:01,517 --> 02:13:03,849
"Shekhar, have you ever
tried to know that..."

1167
02:13:04,854 --> 02:13:06,685
...i love you!

1168
02:13:11,360 --> 02:13:15,353
"Yes, shekhar.
I love you!"

1169
02:13:20,536 --> 02:13:22,026
I don't love you.

1170
02:13:24,540 --> 02:13:28,374
"- You are lying.
- No, this is the truth."

1171
02:13:30,613 --> 02:13:35,380
No! A woman's eyes can
never be mistaken like this.

1172
02:13:36,552 --> 02:13:38,042
You are lying!

1173
02:13:39,722 --> 02:13:42,885
Look into my eyes and tell
me that you don't love me.

1174
02:13:55,504 --> 02:13:57,495
I don't love you.

1175
02:14:04,647 --> 02:14:07,673
'What have i gaineï

1176
02:14:08,184 --> 02:14:10,846
'what have i los

1177
02:14:11,854 --> 02:14:15,187
'maybe the thought of that... '

1178
02:14:15,524 --> 02:14:18,186
'... is making my heart cry'

'lf i'll lose you
i won't be able to live'

1181
02:14:38,547 --> 02:14:40,071
"you can give me your
support, if you want."

1182
02:14:41,050 --> 02:14:43,416
"And if you want, you can
leave me alone and go."

1183
02:14:45,054 --> 02:14:48,546
"And if you love someone, it is
not necessary that you get her."

1184
02:14:49,725 --> 02:14:51,215
Don't you love piya?

1185
02:14:53,396 --> 02:14:54,886
I don't love you.

1186
02:14:56,565 --> 02:14:58,055
I won't make anyone
my brother again.

1187
02:14:59,902 --> 02:15:02,735
"After a long time, i have
got the love of a family."

1188
02:15:03,072 --> 02:15:04,562
I don't want to lose this.

1189
02:15:05,574 --> 02:15:08,441
But one thing i didn't
tell you is that...

1190
02:15:09,578 --> 02:15:11,068
...i love her too.

1191
02:15:11,747 --> 02:15:16,241
You are lying. A woman's eyes
cannot be mistaken like this!

1192
02:15:17,586 --> 02:15:21,920
"Yes, shekhar!
I love you!"

1193
02:15:23,759 --> 02:15:25,249
I love you!

1194
02:16:07,570 --> 02:16:09,902
"One year, seven
months and 18 days."

1195
02:16:16,579 --> 02:16:18,069
You'll not go by this plane.

1196
02:16:18,347 --> 02:16:20,907
"You will come with me after
4 hours, in another plane."

1197
02:16:21,083 --> 02:16:22,573
Come with me.

1198
02:16:27,923 --> 02:16:29,413
And i was thinking that...

1199
02:16:29,925 --> 02:16:32,257
...when priya will become free
of her responsibilities today...

1200
02:16:33,929 --> 02:16:37,763
"...then i will
present her a ring..."

1201
02:16:39,201 --> 02:16:40,930
that i will marry her!

1202
02:16:49,612 --> 02:16:51,102
Shall we sign the papers now?

1203
02:17:45,100 --> 02:17:48,263
"One year, 7 months
and 18 days."

1204
02:17:50,506 --> 02:17:52,440
Sometimes i thought i will
not be able to find you.

1205
02:17:55,010 --> 02:17:59,037
"But now, in 3 hours, i will
take you to india with me."

1206
02:18:03,018 --> 02:18:05,885
'Whenever i saw you,
you were sad."

1207
02:18:06,555 --> 02:18:08,045
I saw you
struggling with life.

1208
02:18:10,559 --> 02:18:13,722
'Today, i was hoping to
see you happy for once..."

1209
02:18:13,896 --> 02:18:16,558
...when the bank will return the
shah industries papers to you.

1210
02:18:18,434 --> 02:18:19,958
But i found you sad even today.

1211
02:18:22,905 --> 02:18:26,238
'To get these papers,
you did everything."

1212
02:18:26,909 --> 02:18:28,399
You have them today.

1213
02:18:29,578 --> 02:18:31,569
"So, god took away something
more important than them."

1214
02:18:35,084 --> 02:18:36,915
I want to see you happy.

1215
02:18:37,586 --> 02:18:39,076
"I want to give you
so much happiness..."

1216
02:18:39,188 --> 02:18:40,746
...that there is no place
left for sorrow in your life.

1217
02:18:42,091 --> 02:18:43,649
I know this is
not the right time.

1218
02:18:44,260 --> 02:18:45,750
"But whether good or bad..."

1219
02:18:46,929 --> 02:18:52,799
...i won't let any
moment make you sad.

1220
02:18:57,873 --> 02:19:00,706
I want to marry you.

1221
02:19:11,554 --> 02:19:13,283
You are a very nice man.

1222
02:19:16,025 --> 02:19:18,892
'That girl will indeed be
fortunate, who'll get your love."

1223
02:19:24,567 --> 02:19:26,899
But i have had my share
of love in my life.

1224
02:19:32,041 --> 02:19:35,067
"Now, my family will
decide about my life."

1225
02:19:37,580 --> 02:19:40,743
My father and grandmother.

1226
02:19:42,251 --> 02:19:46,585
I want to meet them right now.

1227
02:19:53,262 --> 02:19:54,695
Shall i tell you the truth?

1228
02:19:54,863 --> 02:19:56,694
"After investigating
for so many days..."

1229
02:19:56,765 --> 02:19:59,063
...i don't find this to be
a normal hit and run case.

1230
02:20:02,037 --> 02:20:03,527
The whole story.

1231
02:20:33,235 --> 02:20:37,569
'Aii the time... '

1232
02:20:38,240 --> 02:20:42,904
'... i keep thinking of you'

1233
02:20:55,858 --> 02:21:01,694
'my every breath... '

1234
02:21:02,197 --> 02:21:06,190
'... takes your name'

1235
02:21:18,547 --> 02:21:21,539
'there is some plea... '

1236
02:21:22,051 --> 02:21:27,887
'... buried in your hear

1237
02:21:51,080 --> 02:21:52,570
i'll take it.

1238
02:22:04,026 --> 02:22:05,516
Who is it?

1239
02:22:43,732 --> 02:22:46,895
"After 20 minutes, i..."

1240
02:22:47,903 --> 02:22:51,395
"...will leave this
place, forever."

1241
02:22:55,844 --> 02:22:59,678
I have hidden
something from you.

1242
02:23:02,651 --> 02:23:07,179
"And before leaving..."

1243
02:23:07,856 --> 02:23:11,257
...i want to tell
you everything.

1244
02:23:19,535 --> 02:23:21,025
Even i love you.

1245
02:23:25,307 --> 02:23:29,869
"Yes, priya.
I love you very much."

1246
02:23:32,548 --> 02:23:34,880
I was never able to tell you.

1247
02:23:40,055 --> 02:23:41,886
Do you want to know why?

1248
02:23:43,892 --> 02:23:45,382
Yes.

1249
02:23:46,895 --> 02:23:50,387
"Priya, will you hear a poem?"

1250
02:23:55,003 --> 02:23:58,336
"'Without you, how can i live"'

1251
02:24:01,009 --> 02:24:04,342
'how can i live without you'

1252
02:24:05,514 --> 02:24:07,641
'the nights seem
as long as ages'

1253
02:24:11,019 --> 02:24:13,283
'the days seem
as long as ages'

1254
02:24:14,990 --> 02:24:17,754
'you come back'

1255
02:24:19,528 --> 02:24:21,689
"'my heart says,
come back"'

1256
02:24:25,000 --> 02:24:26,865
'lonely i feel again'

1257
02:24:29,037 --> 02:24:31,369
'i miss you again'

1258
02:24:33,041 --> 02:24:36,033
'i am nervous again'

1259
02:24:37,012 --> 02:24:39,037
'you are making me restless'

1260
02:24:41,116 --> 02:24:44,711
"'come back, says my heart"'

1261
02:24:44,887 --> 02:24:46,878
"'in my heart,
there are several memories"'

1262
02:24:47,556 --> 02:24:50,218
'i am very ionely without you'

1263
02:24:55,564 --> 02:24:58,897
amar had never even
heard this poem.

1264
02:24:59,902 --> 02:25:02,393
I am the man...

1265
02:25:02,571 --> 02:25:05,563
...because of whom
amar met with an accident.

1266
02:25:10,078 --> 02:25:11,568
"Piya, listen."

1267
02:25:21,590 --> 02:25:23,080
There's a car behind you!

1268
02:26:18,080 --> 02:26:20,241
"Papa, i have
committed a grave sin."

1269
02:26:26,088 --> 02:26:27,919
I fell in love with a man...

1270
02:26:29,925 --> 02:26:31,586
...because of whom
amar lost his life.

1271
02:26:33,595 --> 02:26:35,495
I fell in love with a man...

1272
02:26:36,932 --> 02:26:39,765
...who lied to everyone and
became a part of our lives.

1273
02:26:44,272 --> 02:26:47,435
I never realized when i
fell in love with shekhar.

1274
02:26:49,778 --> 02:26:51,939
But i did all this unknowingly.

1275
02:26:56,051 --> 02:27:00,715
"But today, when
i know the truth..."

1276
02:27:02,457 --> 02:27:05,893
...why does my heart say that
i must stop him from leaving?

1277
02:27:08,897 --> 02:27:12,731
'Today, when my family made
a decision about my life..."

1278
02:27:14,636 --> 02:27:17,070
...why do i feel like rebelling?

1279
02:27:20,075 --> 02:27:22,407
I am no more your good daughter.

1280
02:27:24,579 --> 02:27:26,410
I am no more your good daughter.

1281
02:27:32,587 --> 02:27:38,082
Why do i still feel that
shekhar should return?

1282
02:27:39,594 --> 02:27:42,757
Even when i know that
he has killed amar.

1283
02:28:08,390 --> 02:28:13,054
Shekhar did not kill amar.

1284
02:28:16,064 --> 02:28:17,554
He didn't kill him.

1285
02:28:19,401 --> 02:28:25,567
We lost amar in a
road accident.

1286
02:28:26,908 --> 02:28:28,398
He left all of us!

1287
02:28:30,579 --> 02:28:34,913
'When shekhar came
home the first time..."

1288
02:28:39,921 --> 02:28:43,755
...he had told me
everything right then.

1289
02:28:48,763 --> 02:28:50,754
I didn't see that accident.

1290
02:28:54,536 --> 02:28:58,700
But the truth and honesty
that was in his eyes...

1291
02:28:59,875 --> 02:29:04,869
...was worth trusting.

1292
02:29:08,884 --> 02:29:15,380
"Even after knowing everything,
i have accepted shekhar."

1293
02:29:15,891 --> 02:29:18,382
Then how can you be a culprit?

1294
02:29:23,064 --> 02:29:27,023
'What shekhar
snatched from us..."

1295
02:29:31,573 --> 02:29:35,065
...we have snatched much
more than from himself.

1296
02:29:35,577 --> 02:29:39,138
For taking care of all of us.

1297
02:29:42,584 --> 02:29:46,577
Our amar has not left us.

1298
02:29:47,589 --> 02:29:49,079
He has returned!

1299
02:29:52,093 --> 02:29:53,583
He has returned.

1300
02:29:55,864 --> 02:29:58,697
Bosco had called. Shekhar
has met with an accident.

1301
02:29:58,867 --> 02:30:00,357
He is in hospital.

1302
02:30:40,575 --> 02:30:42,065
"Brother, please do not go."

1303
02:30:45,914 --> 02:30:49,748
Remember you had promised
me a birthday present?

1304
02:30:51,086 --> 02:30:53,919
"I want that present, brother.

1305
02:30:57,025 --> 02:31:00,722
You used to tell me that i
am the best girl in the world.

1306
02:31:01,863 --> 02:31:04,195
So this girl wants
her brother back.

1307
02:31:05,033 --> 02:31:06,523
Please come back.

1308
02:32:11,199 --> 02:32:12,689
I spoke to the doctor just now.

1309
02:32:13,034 --> 02:32:14,661
Shekhar is gaining
consciousness for little time.

1310
02:32:14,769 --> 02:32:16,532
And he is calling
out priya's name.

1311
02:32:16,705 --> 02:32:18,696
Doctors say that ill be better
for priya to stay with him now.

1312
02:33:31,379 --> 02:33:35,372
I had told you that i
want to see you happy.

1313
02:33:38,887 --> 02:33:41,219
Hold his hand and
sit next to him!

1314
02:33:42,557 --> 02:33:44,548
He won't be able to
leave you and go.

1315
02:33:48,229 --> 02:33:51,892
"Go piya, shekhar
is waiting for you."

1316
02:33:53,401 --> 02:33:54,834
Go!

1317
02:34:11,853 --> 02:34:17,018
A closed fist.
A ring in the fist.

1318
02:34:21,262 --> 02:34:23,253
"I free you from
this relationship, piya."

1319
02:34:35,877 --> 02:34:40,280
"Uncle, calgary is
not a nice place."

1320
02:34:59,901 --> 02:35:01,300
I am leaving.

1321
02:35:02,904 --> 02:35:05,236
"More than the law,
this family needs shekhar."

1322
02:35:13,314 --> 02:35:16,511
"Mr. D'mello,
i cannot believe this!"

1323
02:35:31,533 --> 02:35:34,934
"Piya, brother shekhar
has recovered.
