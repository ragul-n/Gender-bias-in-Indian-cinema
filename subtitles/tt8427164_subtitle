1
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:22,012
There can be only two reasons for someone
to run around at -2Â° at midnight.

2
00:01:22,412 --> 00:01:25,913
Either he has failed in his career...
Or in love...

3
00:01:25,913 --> 00:01:27,795
I'm at the top of my career.

4
00:01:27,795 --> 00:01:31,456
Don't know where I stand in my love life...

5
00:01:31,836 --> 00:01:36,588
LOVE STRUCK

6
00:01:50,215 --> 00:01:55,598
Let's go... Let's go...

7
00:01:55,598 --> 00:01:59,429
Ishaan, we want it safe...

8
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:06,683
All the best, Ishaan.

9
00:02:08,854 --> 00:02:11,275
Come on...
Stop the goal.

10
00:02:11,815 --> 00:02:14,437
Go for his face.
Crush it.

11
00:02:16,437 --> 00:02:18,728
Challenge accepted.

12
00:02:23,151 --> 00:02:25,532
Ishaan! Ishaan! Ishaan!

13
00:02:31,945 --> 00:02:35,616
Ishaan... Ishaan please...
Just three more minutes and the trophy is ours.

14
00:02:35,616 --> 00:02:36,657
Please try and understand.

15
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:40,239
They want you to lose your cool.
They've fixed the match.

16
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:43,910
Stay cool... Let's go...

17
00:02:46,162 --> 00:02:49,493
Pass the ball here...

18
00:02:53,295 --> 00:02:55,296
- Goal!
- Yes!

19
00:02:59,088 --> 00:03:00,918
- Hey, Rudra!
- Oh, s***!

20
00:03:33,395 --> 00:03:36,976
- Rintu, close the gate.
- Okay.

21
00:04:52,802 --> 00:04:54,263
Hey...

22
00:04:55,513 --> 00:04:57,355
Put that down!

23
00:04:57,894 --> 00:05:00,856
What's the rush?

24
00:05:04,358 --> 00:05:06,398
I'll see you in Kolkata.

25
00:05:07,229 --> 00:05:08,859
Is it this train you are taking?

26
00:05:08,859 --> 00:05:12,441
Do you know why they left the trophy?

27
00:05:12,441 --> 00:05:15,563
Because they knew
that the trophy belonged to us.

28
00:05:16,564 --> 00:05:20,445
- This is it.
- Okay.

29
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:22,657
- Bye... See you later...
- Bye...

30
00:05:22,776 --> 00:05:24,868
Just wait for two more minutes.

31
00:05:24,868 --> 00:05:25,448
Why?

32
00:05:25,448 --> 00:05:27,909
Samir is getting some cola for you.

33
00:05:27,909 --> 00:05:29,490
But I can buy it on the train.

34
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:31,740
It's not the normal cola.
It's mixed with vodka.

35
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:34,282
Really!

36
00:05:34,872 --> 00:05:36,323
Bro!

37
00:05:36,323 --> 00:05:38,204
I got the cola!

38
00:05:38,574 --> 00:05:41,035
Just a minute.
I'll get it right away.

39
00:05:45,327 --> 00:05:49,249
- You should go... You should go too...
- Oh yes, yes...

40
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:51,830
Catch it.

41
00:06:06,718 --> 00:06:08,388
S***!

42
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:12,761
S***!

43
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:16,342
No vodka for you... Bad luck.

44
00:06:18,973 --> 00:06:21,434
Challenge accepted.

45
00:06:40,903 --> 00:06:44,315
I knew it. If he accepted the challenge,
he'll win it.

46
00:06:44,315 --> 00:06:45,606
That's for sure.

47
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:52,569
Ishaan!

48
00:06:56,451 --> 00:06:58,112
You could have died, you know.

49
00:06:58,112 --> 00:06:59,243
Can't you see?

50
00:06:59,243 --> 00:07:01,113
You could've died.

51
00:07:20,502 --> 00:07:22,254
Are you mad?

52
00:07:40,092 --> 00:07:42,633
I'm okay. I'll call you back.

53
00:07:51,848 --> 00:07:52,478
Hello, Rahul.

54
00:07:52,478 --> 00:07:54,599
What's up? All good?

55
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:56,349
You won't believe what just happened.

56
00:07:56,349 --> 00:08:01,102
Ishaan, does it make sense
to risk your life for a silly dare?

57
00:08:01,142 --> 00:08:04,484
And since I risked my life, I found my life.

58
00:08:04,604 --> 00:08:06,195
Oh, really?

59
00:08:06,195 --> 00:08:10,696
I was going die but she came like an angel
and she saved my life.

60
00:08:10,897 --> 00:08:12,027
Is she beautiful?

61
00:08:12,067 --> 00:08:13,778
She's damn beautiful.

62
00:08:13,778 --> 00:08:15,149
Love at first sight.

63
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:16,779
You know what?
Her father...

64
00:08:16,779 --> 00:08:20,111
...should keep her locked up in a safe.

65
00:08:20,321 --> 00:08:20,782
Otherwise...

66
00:08:20,782 --> 00:08:23,953
...some guy like me will run away with her.
You know...

67
00:08:27,865 --> 00:08:28,906
Hello?

68
00:08:29,326 --> 00:08:32,367
Hello? Hello? Hello?

69
00:08:35,079 --> 00:08:38,119
Did you hear everything I said?

70
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,621
Excuse me...

71
00:08:40,751 --> 00:08:42,792
Ticket?

72
00:08:43,082 --> 00:08:45,123
Yes, one second.
Can you please hold this?

73
00:08:47,254 --> 00:08:48,795
What is this smell?

74
00:08:50,165 --> 00:08:51,627
This is nothing.
Here's the ticket.

75
00:08:51,837 --> 00:08:53,667
I can smell alcohol
and you're saying it's nothing.

76
00:08:53,667 --> 00:08:55,298
No, it's just cola.

77
00:08:55,298 --> 00:08:56,669
Give it to me.

78
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:59,050
This is mine.
Why should I give it to you?

79
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:01,971
If you're thirsty,
I can get you a bottle.

80
00:09:02,722 --> 00:09:04,262
I know it's yours.

81
00:09:04,472 --> 00:09:07,554
I just want to smell it.
I'll give it back to you.

82
00:09:09,975 --> 00:09:13,927
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

83
00:09:13,927 --> 00:09:15,347
Hey.

84
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:17,979
What did you just do?

85
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:23,771
We're allowed to drink alcohol
on international flights.

86
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:24,772
Why can't we drink on the train?

87
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:27,484
That bottle had alcohol.
Now, try and prove it.

88
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:28,774
You want proof?

89
00:09:31,895 --> 00:09:33,186
Hey...

90
00:09:33,777 --> 00:09:35,357
Show me your ticket?

91
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:37,608
You just threw my ticket out.

92
00:09:37,608 --> 00:09:40,239
Prove that you had a ticket.

93
00:09:42,111 --> 00:09:43,401
Oh god!

94
00:09:45,241 --> 00:09:49,784
I usually take Rs. 500 for such petty cases.

95
00:09:49,904 --> 00:09:51,905
But you've hurt my ego.

96
00:09:52,115 --> 00:09:55,367
That's why I'm deboarding you
500 KM from Kolkata.

97
00:09:55,367 --> 00:09:59,498
Sir, I have money...
I'll give you Rs. 500...

98
00:09:59,498 --> 00:10:04,001
Bye, bye, bye...
Don't try to board the train again.

99
00:10:04,251 --> 00:10:05,661
Do you still want proof?

100
00:10:09,294 --> 00:10:10,413
S***!

101
00:10:33,465 --> 00:10:36,136
- A bottle of water, please.
- Yes, one second.

102
00:10:36,676 --> 00:10:39,348
Please, hurry.

103
00:10:52,604 --> 00:10:54,685
What's up, darling?

104
00:10:54,685 --> 00:10:56,436
What are you doing here so late at night?

105
00:10:59,147 --> 00:11:02,109
Hey, what's your hurry, darling?

106
00:11:02,229 --> 00:11:05,190
Do you need some help with the water?

107
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:06,150
Help!

108
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:08,981
Seems like our lucky day.

109
00:11:08,981 --> 00:11:10,232
Will you help her?

110
00:11:10,232 --> 00:11:11,113
No, no, no...

111
00:11:11,113 --> 00:11:13,484
You're not loud enough.

112
00:11:13,484 --> 00:11:16,656
And there's no one else on this platform.

113
00:11:16,656 --> 00:11:17,325
Help!

114
00:11:17,325 --> 00:11:19,537
No one is coming to save you.

115
00:11:19,577 --> 00:11:21,238
No one...

116
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:26,910
S***!

117
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:28,581
Who is he?

118
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:32,083
Where did he come from?

119
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:48,420
What are you doing here?

120
00:11:52,463 --> 00:11:53,633
What are you...

121
00:11:55,054 --> 00:11:58,466
Were you thrown off the train
for drinking too?

122
00:12:01,557 --> 00:12:03,428
This is not alcohol.
This is water.

123
00:12:03,428 --> 00:12:05,098
You can keep it.

124
00:12:05,098 --> 00:12:06,059
Then what are you doing here?

125
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:06,970
Hey!

126
00:12:10,311 --> 00:12:13,063
- Here you go.
- Thank you, sir.

127
00:12:13,222 --> 00:12:14,223
Now tell me...

128
00:12:14,223 --> 00:12:17,064
I'm not a beggar.

129
00:12:18,315 --> 00:12:19,395
Then?

130
00:12:26,319 --> 00:12:32,232
Do you think you're Lord Krishna
trying to save Draupadi?

131
00:12:33,402 --> 00:12:37,404
- Lord Krishna was Draupadi's brother, right?
- Yes!

132
00:12:37,404 --> 00:12:39,325
Then, I'm not Lord Krishna...

133
00:12:42,577 --> 00:12:45,328
Then, consider yourself Lord Rama.

134
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:53,242
You think you're a bigshot hero?

135
00:12:53,242 --> 00:12:56,203
Have you seen our muscle power?

136
00:12:57,873 --> 00:13:01,455
We'll take you out like a fly.

137
00:13:07,959 --> 00:13:09,960
Challenge accepted.

138
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,211
Go, get him.

139
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:34,431
Get up, Madna! Get up!

140
00:13:34,431 --> 00:13:36,222
Why did you hit him so hard?

141
00:13:36,222 --> 00:13:42,356
Just imagine if Lord Rama was home
when Ravana had come to kidnap Sita?

142
00:13:43,305 --> 00:13:46,147
He would beat the life out of Ravana.

143
00:13:46,147 --> 00:13:47,558
Exactly!

144
00:13:47,558 --> 00:13:49,108
Hey!

145
00:14:10,949 --> 00:14:12,870
Hit him!

146
00:14:21,034 --> 00:14:23,245
Please let me go...

147
00:14:38,082 --> 00:14:40,383
Let him go.
He's my brother.

148
00:14:41,043 --> 00:14:43,465
Please don't beat him.
He's my brother.

149
00:14:50,428 --> 00:14:52,139
That hurts!

150
00:14:52,139 --> 00:14:54,470
Do you know what Lord Krishna said
in Ramayana?

151
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:58,431
Lord Krishna is in Mahabharata.
Not in Ramayana.

152
00:14:58,972 --> 00:15:02,514
There's only one hero in Ramayana and that's Lord Rama.
Just Lord Rama.

153
00:15:06,265 --> 00:15:11,058
Hello! I'm sending you the location on WhatsApp.
Bring all the guys here.

154
00:15:13,309 --> 00:15:15,309
- Who are you calling?
- Friends.

155
00:15:15,309 --> 00:15:20,352
- So, you're getting more goons?
- Yes... No...

156
00:15:23,103 --> 00:15:26,655
That phone was worth Rs. 19000.

157
00:15:26,655 --> 00:15:29,446
I'll not hit you.
Will you hit me?

158
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:38,821
Stop!

159
00:15:38,821 --> 00:15:43,203
I pray to you, goddess.

160
00:15:43,203 --> 00:15:46,244
Really? Why didn't you
think about it before?

161
00:15:48,785 --> 00:15:50,537
Stop it!

162
00:15:51,286 --> 00:15:53,458
He'll die.

163
00:15:55,709 --> 00:15:56,789
Go...

164
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:02,462
Were you trying to kill him?

165
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:05,293
When I'm angry, I lose control.

166
00:16:31,266 --> 00:16:33,977
Hi, I'm Ishaan.

167
00:16:49,524 --> 00:16:53,526
You don't need to thank me
but at least tell me your name.

168
00:16:54,147 --> 00:16:57,649
You didn't thank me either
for saving your life on the train.

169
00:17:06,113 --> 00:17:07,243
Thanks.

170
00:17:07,453 --> 00:17:09,994
- Khushi.
- Khushi? Nice name.

171
00:17:11,035 --> 00:17:12,826
- Are you from Kolkata?
- Yes.

172
00:17:13,116 --> 00:17:15,367
Where do you live in Kolkata?

173
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:23,250
What happens in this book is...

174
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:26,122
The hero and the heroine fall in love
but they don't end up together.

175
00:17:26,122 --> 00:17:28,334
The hero dies...
Very interesting book.

176
00:17:29,544 --> 00:17:31,255
Please read.

177
00:17:32,005 --> 00:17:33,586
Are you a sadist?

178
00:17:33,586 --> 00:17:35,877
I was just kidding.

179
00:17:35,967 --> 00:17:37,547
Do you know how tensed I am?

180
00:17:37,547 --> 00:17:40,259
I thought I'll keep my mind diverted
by reading.

181
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:42,090
You just ruined it.

182
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:45,052
Why are you tensed?

183
00:17:45,222 --> 00:17:48,843
This is the first time I saw goons
so up, close and personal.

184
00:17:48,843 --> 00:17:49,764
So sad.

185
00:17:49,764 --> 00:17:52,054
I feel like crying.

186
00:17:54,425 --> 00:17:55,636
When will I reach home?

187
00:17:55,636 --> 00:17:57,887
I only like my home.

188
00:17:59,768 --> 00:18:03,890
If you want you can call home.

189
00:18:04,851 --> 00:18:08,182
Why should I worry my folks?

190
00:18:09,353 --> 00:18:10,853
Mom is calling.

191
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:12,565
- Hello, Mom.
- Hey, hey...

192
00:18:13,275 --> 00:18:15,186
Hello, who's this?

193
00:18:16,026 --> 00:18:17,687
That's my phone.

194
00:18:21,649 --> 00:18:22,779
Hi, Mom.

195
00:18:22,779 --> 00:18:23,740
Who's that girl?

196
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:26,902
Khushi... She answered my phone by mistake.

197
00:18:26,902 --> 00:18:29,072
By mistake?

198
00:18:29,072 --> 00:18:30,322
Give her the phone.

199
00:18:32,114 --> 00:18:35,576
Why? It'll be very odd...

200
00:18:35,576 --> 00:18:37,697
I'm telling you to give her the phone.

201
00:18:37,997 --> 00:18:39,577
Hold on.

202
00:18:41,498 --> 00:18:42,579
She wants to speak to you...

203
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:45,830
- What will I say?
- I don't know...

204
00:18:48,452 --> 00:18:49,662
Hello, aunty.

205
00:18:49,832 --> 00:18:50,913
Actually...

206
00:18:50,913 --> 00:18:54,204
I thought it was my phone
and answered the call.

207
00:18:54,415 --> 00:18:55,915
We have the same phone.

208
00:18:55,915 --> 00:18:57,586
No, it's okay.

209
00:18:57,586 --> 00:19:00,127
But what are you doing with Ishaan?

210
00:19:00,127 --> 00:19:02,628
I missed my train, aunty.

211
00:19:02,839 --> 00:19:04,089
And Ishaan?

212
00:19:04,089 --> 00:19:05,630
He has missed his train too.

213
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:07,961
- Ishaan has missed his train?
- What?

214
00:19:08,211 --> 00:19:09,841
He has missed his train?

215
00:19:09,841 --> 00:19:11,593
I asked him to take the flight.

216
00:19:13,133 --> 00:19:16,965
So, both of you have missed
your train together, right?

217
00:19:16,965 --> 00:19:20,596
No, he missed it first.
Then I missed the train too.

218
00:19:20,596 --> 00:19:21,968
Give me the phone.

219
00:19:23,558 --> 00:19:26,019
Why are you scaring her?

220
00:19:26,019 --> 00:19:26,810
Ishaan...

221
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:29,931
I'll explain everything when I'm home.

222
00:19:29,931 --> 00:19:31,102
Okay.

223
00:19:31,722 --> 00:19:33,393
Don't be naughty.

224
00:19:33,393 --> 00:19:34,933
Okay, Mom. Bye.

225
00:19:37,064 --> 00:19:39,226
Why did you answer my phone?

226
00:19:39,316 --> 00:19:41,437
I thought my mom was calling.

227
00:19:41,437 --> 00:19:43,608
We've the same phone.
So, I answered it by mistake.

228
00:19:43,608 --> 00:19:45,528
Why will your mom call on my phone?

229
00:19:45,528 --> 00:19:47,780
I am tensed because of you.

230
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,692
- Because of me?
- Yes... Because of you.

231
00:19:51,611 --> 00:19:54,533
Okay... Then...

232
00:19:54,533 --> 00:19:56,194
What can I do to relieve your tension?

233
00:19:56,194 --> 00:19:58,986
Nothing. Just leave me alone.
And go sit there.

234
00:19:59,825 --> 00:20:01,036
Okay.

235
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:28,499
Just in case.

236
00:21:33,831 --> 00:21:35,831
Why are you sitting here?

237
00:21:35,912 --> 00:21:37,952
You asked me to come sit here.

238
00:21:37,952 --> 00:21:40,623
I didn't ask you sit so far away, either.

239
00:21:41,084 --> 00:21:44,416
A little close and a little far.

240
00:21:45,836 --> 00:21:50,249
Women are a mystery...

241
00:21:50,789 --> 00:21:54,630
Nothing is ever clear...

242
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:58,382
They are beyond the law

243
00:21:58,382 --> 00:22:02,384
And that's a lady for you...

244
00:22:03,635 --> 00:22:08,757
Hey, my phone... My phone...
Give me my phone back...

245
00:22:09,508 --> 00:22:12,299
S***! I was going to beat
my own high score.

246
00:22:12,299 --> 00:22:13,300
You ruined it.

247
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:15,140
Do you understand my pain now?

248
00:22:15,391 --> 00:22:20,102
This is exactly how I felt
when you revealed the book's climax.

249
00:22:20,763 --> 00:22:23,104
That was just for fun.

250
00:22:23,104 --> 00:22:25,015
I was making conversation with you.

251
00:22:25,015 --> 00:22:26,226
Really?

252
00:22:26,856 --> 00:22:27,686
Yeah.

253
00:22:27,686 --> 00:22:31,978
You were just trying to impress me.

254
00:22:32,269 --> 00:22:35,650
Why would I want to impress you?

255
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:42,363
Didn't you say my father should lock me up
in a safe?

256
00:22:42,363 --> 00:22:45,064
Why don't you suggest a bank?

257
00:22:48,366 --> 00:22:51,778
You heard everything?

258
00:22:52,028 --> 00:22:53,028
Yes.

259
00:22:53,318 --> 00:22:54,069
Oh.

260
00:22:55,659 --> 00:22:59,121
That's good in a way.
I won't have to start from scratch.

261
00:22:59,121 --> 00:23:00,992
You're such a big flirt.

262
00:23:00,992 --> 00:23:02,663
What's wrong with flirting?

263
00:23:02,663 --> 00:23:03,873
You don't think it's wrong.

264
00:23:03,873 --> 00:23:05,915
No... It's wrong to tease.

265
00:23:05,915 --> 00:23:07,325
Flirting is fine.

266
00:23:07,325 --> 00:23:09,206
And what's the difference
between the two?

267
00:23:09,376 --> 00:23:12,577
If the girl doesn't like it, it's teasing.

268
00:23:12,577 --> 00:23:14,749
And if she likes it, it's flirting.

269
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:20,002
I really don't want to waste
my energy talking to you.

270
00:23:20,002 --> 00:23:23,083
I'm very tired.
Please leave me alone.

271
00:23:23,543 --> 00:23:26,044
Let me first get a hold of you...
Then I can leave you...

272
00:23:34,468 --> 00:23:36,339
Are you hungry?

273
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:39,301
Wait.

274
00:23:39,301 --> 00:23:42,052
As if he's going to cook for me himself.

275
00:23:43,893 --> 00:23:45,434
What are you doing?

276
00:23:45,434 --> 00:23:47,765
I'm checking if I have
some food in my bag.

277
00:23:47,935 --> 00:23:49,725
No problem. It's okay.

278
00:24:18,319 --> 00:24:20,240
- Want some bread and omelette?
- Yes.

279
00:24:22,241 --> 00:24:24,112
Here you are...

280
00:24:55,177 --> 00:24:56,677
Hurry up.

281
00:25:07,432 --> 00:25:08,303
Khushi?

282
00:25:09,263 --> 00:25:10,844
Do you have a boyfriend?

283
00:25:11,935 --> 00:25:12,595
Yes!

284
00:25:13,686 --> 00:25:15,346
So, you're single?

285
00:25:15,977 --> 00:25:17,637
Okay, then. I love you.

286
00:25:19,438 --> 00:25:21,019
What the hell did you just say?

287
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:23,520
What are you saying?

288
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,441
Wait. Drink some water.

289
00:25:30,103 --> 00:25:31,694
What the hell did you just say?

290
00:25:31,854 --> 00:25:34,355
Don't think you heard me.

291
00:25:34,695 --> 00:25:36,196
I said I love you.

292
00:25:36,196 --> 00:25:37,777
No, I heard you.

293
00:25:37,777 --> 00:25:40,028
But all of a sudden, how can you say this?

294
00:25:40,028 --> 00:25:41,199
That's how I am...

295
00:25:41,199 --> 00:25:43,650
You just met me today.
How can you just say it?

296
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:47,282
I should have said it when I first saw you.
Sorry about the delay.

297
00:25:47,282 --> 00:25:50,243
That means you just blurt out
whatever comes to your mind.

298
00:25:50,243 --> 00:25:51,743
Don't you think before you speak?

299
00:25:52,454 --> 00:25:55,746
Yeah... I'm like this.

300
00:25:55,746 --> 00:25:57,826
And I'm not like this at all.

301
00:25:57,826 --> 00:26:00,458
I take time before I like someone.

302
00:26:00,708 --> 00:26:02,578
Yeah, okay. Take your time.

303
00:26:02,578 --> 00:26:06,291
You want to get to know me better...
But after that you'll have to like me.

304
00:26:06,411 --> 00:26:09,212
Liking someone and falling in love
with someone is not the same thing.

305
00:26:10,912 --> 00:26:12,914
All you have to do is like me...

306
00:26:12,914 --> 00:26:15,796
I'll make you fall in love with me
after that.

307
00:26:15,796 --> 00:26:17,626
It's not that easy, Ishaan.

308
00:26:18,046 --> 00:26:21,668
Train, friendship, love at first sight...
I don't believe in all this.

309
00:26:21,668 --> 00:26:23,589
Seriously, even I didn't.

310
00:26:23,589 --> 00:26:28,011
But I've started believing since today's train
was on time.

311
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:34,634
This rain is like you.
Waiting for a signal from the cloud.

312
00:26:34,634 --> 00:26:35,764
Takes it's time.

313
00:26:35,764 --> 00:26:38,517
Sometimes it doesn't rain
even when the clouds around.

314
00:26:55,394 --> 00:27:02,397
Now that I've missed the train

315
00:27:02,397 --> 00:27:09,901
The timetable has gone haywire

316
00:27:09,901 --> 00:27:14,243
And now I am caught,
And now I am stuck

317
00:27:14,243 --> 00:27:20,946
I've come to a halt at your level crossing

318
00:27:20,946 --> 00:27:25,499
You are absolutely right
Can't get you out of my sight

319
00:27:25,499 --> 00:27:29,950
You are all over my head and heart, alright

320
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:34,502
You are absolutely right
Can't get you out of my sight

321
00:27:34,502 --> 00:27:38,955
You are all over my head and heart, alright

322
00:27:39,335 --> 00:27:41,836
You might think I'm too forward

323
00:27:41,836 --> 00:27:44,167
Liking the same photo ten times

324
00:27:44,167 --> 00:27:46,458
You might think I'm a roadside romeo

325
00:27:46,458 --> 00:27:48,759
But I'm training to be Superman

326
00:27:48,759 --> 00:27:53,302
I'll do it or die trying

327
00:27:53,302 --> 00:27:57,634
You are absolutely right
Can't get you out of my sight

328
00:27:57,634 --> 00:28:02,056
You are all over my head and heart, alright

329
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:06,848
You are absolutely right
Can't get you out of my sight

330
00:28:06,848 --> 00:28:11,180
You are all over my head and heart, alright

331
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:32,150
Call me a guy from the hood

332
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:34,481
Who has winked at you

333
00:28:34,481 --> 00:28:36,822
You can show off hi-fi structure

334
00:28:36,822 --> 00:28:39,193
But I can finish it in one sip

335
00:28:39,193 --> 00:28:43,366
I'll do it or die trying

336
00:28:43,366 --> 00:28:47,828
You are absolutely right
Can't get you out of my sight

337
00:28:47,828 --> 00:28:52,330
You are all over my head and heart, alright

338
00:28:52,490 --> 00:28:57,082
You are absolutely right
Can't get you out of my sight

339
00:28:57,082 --> 00:29:01,664
You are all over my head and heart, alright

340
00:29:04,085 --> 00:29:10,669
May I have your attention please?

341
00:29:10,669 --> 00:29:14,801
Train is running late...

342
00:29:14,801 --> 00:29:20,134
Platform one, platform two
Platform one, two, three, four

343
00:29:20,134 --> 00:29:22,384
Call me a guy from the hood

344
00:29:22,384 --> 00:29:24,675
Who has winked at you

345
00:29:24,675 --> 00:29:27,006
You can show off hi-fi structure

346
00:29:27,006 --> 00:29:29,387
But I can finish it in one sip

347
00:29:29,387 --> 00:29:33,640
I'll do it or die trying

348
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:38,312
You are absolutely right
Can't get you out of my sight

349
00:29:38,312 --> 00:29:42,514
You are all over my head and heart, alright

350
00:29:42,684 --> 00:29:47,356
You are absolutely right
Can't get you out of my sight

351
00:29:47,356 --> 00:29:52,108
You are all over my head and heart, alright

352
00:29:57,861 --> 00:30:00,112
Ishaan, let's go.

353
00:30:00,362 --> 00:30:01,403
I'm not coming.

354
00:30:01,403 --> 00:30:03,444
Why? What happened?

355
00:30:04,074 --> 00:30:06,696
Unless you say "I love you",
I won't come.

356
00:30:06,696 --> 00:30:09,827
Stop being a brat and board the train.

357
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:19,161
Our journey is just beginning.

358
00:30:19,161 --> 00:30:23,494
Give me some time.
I'll let you know my decision tomorrow.

359
00:30:23,494 --> 00:30:25,124
Come on.

360
00:30:41,502 --> 00:30:43,673
My eyes were looking for Khushi.

361
00:30:44,134 --> 00:30:47,425
But my heart was sure
that we would meet again.

362
00:30:47,425 --> 00:30:50,546
I lost her at a station.

363
00:30:50,546 --> 00:30:54,138
But in this city of 205 square kilometers...

364
00:30:54,138 --> 00:30:58,970
I'll find her again.
With that certainty, I set foot in Kolkata.

365
00:31:03,972 --> 00:31:08,265
I looked for her everywhere.
But still didn't find her.

366
00:31:12,767 --> 00:31:14,859
Three months and ten days had passed.

367
00:31:15,268 --> 00:31:16,939
I joined college.

368
00:31:17,109 --> 00:31:20,560
But Khushi was still a mystery.

369
00:31:22,062 --> 00:31:28,984
Since then I've been searching for Khushi...

370
00:31:29,195 --> 00:31:31,526
Hi, I'm Rahul.

371
00:31:32,486 --> 00:31:34,028
- Hi.
- Hi.

372
00:31:34,368 --> 00:31:39,120
- Can we catch up after college?
- No, not interested.

373
00:31:42,071 --> 00:31:45,533
Ishaan, how long are you going to miss that girl?

374
00:31:45,533 --> 00:31:49,535
Friend. He encourages me when I like a girl.

375
00:31:49,535 --> 00:31:52,746
And he discourages me if I fall in love.

376
00:31:55,377 --> 00:31:58,169
How's college, Ishaan?

377
00:31:58,169 --> 00:31:59,420
Good, Mom.

378
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:04,632
Rahul, did your US visa
really get rejected four times?

379
00:32:04,962 --> 00:32:06,963
His UK visa has also been rejected.

380
00:32:08,463 --> 00:32:11,085
I've applied again.
And this time I'll get it for sure.

381
00:32:11,545 --> 00:32:14,046
You've already joined college here.

382
00:32:14,046 --> 00:32:16,637
Why are you still trying to apply abroad?

383
00:32:16,837 --> 00:32:20,219
I can't deal with my dad's torture.
Who wants to live in this stupid city?

384
00:32:20,219 --> 00:32:22,090
Abroad is abroad.

385
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:24,181
I'll see you later, Mom.
I'm running late.

386
00:32:24,181 --> 00:32:28,513
Don't start any trouble
with the seniors in college.

387
00:32:28,513 --> 00:32:32,596
If there's any issue, speak to your papa.
He'll sort it out with the principal.

388
00:32:32,596 --> 00:32:33,435
Okay, Mom.

389
00:32:33,435 --> 00:32:36,307
Don't worry. I'll handle everything.

390
00:32:36,977 --> 00:32:38,438
Let's go.

391
00:32:39,728 --> 00:32:43,150
What happened?
Please start.

392
00:32:49,813 --> 00:32:51,104
You also start.

393
00:33:05,281 --> 00:33:06,202
Ishaan.

394
00:33:07,322 --> 00:33:08,913
All the seniors are here.

395
00:33:12,075 --> 00:33:12,864
Hey!

396
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,921
First year?

397
00:33:28,622 --> 00:33:33,625
You can't answer properly?
You don't know how to respect your seniors?

398
00:33:34,754 --> 00:33:36,836
Let me handle this.

399
00:33:36,836 --> 00:33:37,966
Hey, listen.

400
00:33:38,427 --> 00:33:42,928
My dad is the principal's friend.
I'll complaint if you rag us.

401
00:33:42,928 --> 00:33:44,760
Oh really?

402
00:33:54,264 --> 00:33:55,685
Please let me go.

403
00:33:55,685 --> 00:33:58,016
- Didn't you say you're going to complaint?
- Sorry, sorry...

404
00:33:58,016 --> 00:34:00,977
- Please go ahead.
- I've made a mistake...

405
00:34:02,728 --> 00:34:06,310
- Is that Porsche yours?
- Yes.

406
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:11,192
- Management quota?
- No. Free seat.

407
00:34:11,192 --> 00:34:15,274
- Free seat? What's your rank?
- Six.

408
00:34:15,895 --> 00:34:18,356
- What's after the six?
- It's just six.

409
00:34:18,356 --> 00:34:20,987
Tell me your bio-data.

410
00:34:21,648 --> 00:34:24,029
I think his name is Ishaan.

411
00:34:24,029 --> 00:34:25,489
He's so handsome!

412
00:34:25,489 --> 00:34:27,740
He's ranked 6th in the MSAT.

413
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:30,072
I think he's six feet tall too.

414
00:34:30,072 --> 00:34:33,033
He drives a Porsche that means he's filthy rich.

415
00:34:33,033 --> 00:34:36,364
Saraswati, let's take him in our group.

416
00:34:36,404 --> 00:34:38,616
Our group's glamour quotient will go up.

417
00:34:38,616 --> 00:34:39,786
Shut up!

418
00:34:39,996 --> 00:34:43,458
Why are you all hitting on a junior shamelessly?

419
00:34:43,458 --> 00:34:46,119
What about when senior boys hit on junior girls?

420
00:34:46,119 --> 00:34:47,289
Why is it wrong when we do it?

421
00:34:47,289 --> 00:34:52,292
I get it but convincing Suresh
is going to be difficult.

422
00:34:52,292 --> 00:34:54,333
I don't think it'll be that easy.

423
00:34:54,373 --> 00:34:57,044
Why are you staring at me?
Do you want to hit me?

424
00:34:57,044 --> 00:34:58,585
Suresh...

425
00:35:00,666 --> 00:35:02,167
Found someone new to bully?

426
00:35:02,167 --> 00:35:04,878
Saraswati, you're updated
with the latest news always.

427
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:07,509
I just wanted to check him out
because he ranked so well.

428
00:35:07,509 --> 00:35:11,171
This is more like first come, first serve.

429
00:35:11,171 --> 00:35:13,512
So, you don't have a chance.

430
00:35:13,512 --> 00:35:17,304
Because we got to him first!

431
00:35:17,344 --> 00:35:18,134
Really?

432
00:35:18,134 --> 00:35:20,306
It's fixed. Got it?

433
00:35:20,766 --> 00:35:22,927
- Think about it.
- Why?

434
00:35:23,638 --> 00:35:27,139
Will you give me a golden biscuit
if I hand him over to you?

435
00:35:27,139 --> 00:35:28,890
Maybe something even better.

436
00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:30,060
What do you mean?

437
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:33,772
I mean First year, CSC, girl...

438
00:35:33,982 --> 00:35:36,643
I heard there was something with you...

439
00:35:36,643 --> 00:35:37,934
I might have heard wrong.

440
00:35:37,934 --> 00:35:39,355
It's all rumour.

441
00:35:39,355 --> 00:35:41,275
Then, it's okay.
No problem.

442
00:35:41,275 --> 00:35:42,737
I'll see you later.

443
00:35:42,737 --> 00:35:44,527
Wait... wait...

444
00:35:45,488 --> 00:35:46,898
Why did you ask me about that girl?

445
00:35:46,898 --> 00:35:49,569
If the rumour was true...

446
00:35:49,569 --> 00:35:53,652
...then I could handover that girl to you...

447
00:35:53,652 --> 00:35:56,903
...and taken this boy in our team.
That's it.

448
00:35:56,903 --> 00:36:00,364
But it's a rumour.
So, it's absolutely okay.

449
00:36:00,364 --> 00:36:03,286
- Okay, bye guys...
- Listen up.

450
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:04,787
Let me think about it.

451
00:36:08,658 --> 00:36:11,620
Okay... Take him.

452
00:36:13,041 --> 00:36:15,662
Don't forget to send the girl.

453
00:36:16,582 --> 00:36:18,043
Come with me.

454
00:36:18,043 --> 00:36:20,334
Ishaan! Ishaan!

455
00:36:24,877 --> 00:36:26,757
My friend.

456
00:36:29,589 --> 00:36:32,340
Yuck! We don't want him.
You come with me.

457
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:36,592
- Okay, sister.
- Ishaan! Ishaan!

458
00:36:39,343 --> 00:36:40,884
Chocolate boy.

459
00:36:40,884 --> 00:36:42,675
I know.

460
00:36:42,675 --> 00:36:46,056
I think he takes good care of his skin.
So handsome...

461
00:36:46,056 --> 00:36:48,968
I think he is naturally beautiful!

462
00:36:48,968 --> 00:36:49,678
You're right!

463
00:36:49,678 --> 00:36:51,059
Hurry up!

464
00:36:51,059 --> 00:36:52,810
Come, Ishaan.

465
00:36:53,219 --> 00:36:59,272
These are your sisters, Madhu, Priya,
Rani and Sudeshna.

466
00:36:59,272 --> 00:37:03,275
Why are introducing me as his sister?
I am not his sister.

467
00:37:03,435 --> 00:37:07,646
Did you feel bad?
Well, I felt bad too...

468
00:37:07,646 --> 00:37:10,728
When he called me sister...

469
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:13,439
Did you call her sister?

470
00:37:13,439 --> 00:37:14,730
Yes, sister.

471
00:37:14,861 --> 00:37:17,402
Listen, this is a college.

472
00:37:17,402 --> 00:37:22,984
You can make friends and girlfriends here.
No scope for sisters here.

473
00:37:23,694 --> 00:37:25,405
Okay, sister.

474
00:37:27,786 --> 00:37:29,947
Mr. Eiffel Tower, please take a seat.

475
00:37:30,077 --> 00:37:33,119
Do you think you are Swami Vivekananda?

476
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:34,789
Why are you calling everyone sister?

477
00:37:35,370 --> 00:37:38,792
No, not everyone.
Except for one person.

478
00:37:38,952 --> 00:37:40,243
Internet love?

479
00:37:40,243 --> 00:37:41,833
No, train love.

480
00:37:41,833 --> 00:37:43,163
But I missed her.

481
00:37:43,493 --> 00:37:44,835
What do you mean by miss?

482
00:37:44,835 --> 00:37:47,746
I mean...

483
00:37:52,378 --> 00:37:53,589
Useless!

484
00:38:00,251 --> 00:38:03,093
You could've at least taken some details
from the girl.

485
00:38:03,093 --> 00:38:07,175
I know nothing about her
except her name and city.

486
00:38:07,175 --> 00:38:09,887
- Where does she live?
- Here in Kolkata.

487
00:38:09,887 --> 00:38:12,177
- What's her name?
- Khushi.

488
00:38:13,098 --> 00:38:14,218
Khushi?

489
00:38:16,759 --> 00:38:20,221
I'm sure it's that girl.

490
00:38:20,221 --> 00:38:21,973
Sister... Sister!

491
00:38:21,973 --> 00:38:22,892
Stop it.

492
00:38:23,063 --> 00:38:26,685
What are you talking about?
What happened?

493
00:38:27,315 --> 00:38:29,316
What does she look like?

494
00:38:29,976 --> 00:38:31,647
Khushi...

495
00:38:31,647 --> 00:38:34,478
Tall, fair, very beautiful...

496
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:37,440
She looks like a foreigner.
But she's very reserved.

497
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:39,901
Must be her... That girl...

498
00:38:39,901 --> 00:38:41,022
Sister?

499
00:38:41,022 --> 00:38:45,573
I know a girl called Khushi.

500
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:49,776
And she is very much like the girl
you just described.

501
00:38:49,776 --> 00:38:52,527
Sister, sister, sister...
Please tell me...

502
00:38:52,527 --> 00:38:54,077
- I'll tell you under one condition.
- Tell me, sister.

503
00:38:54,077 --> 00:38:58,200
- Don't you dare call me sister again.
- Exactly.

504
00:38:58,779 --> 00:38:59,870
Okay, sister.

505
00:39:01,451 --> 00:39:02,912
Get out!

506
00:39:05,333 --> 00:39:07,334
Is that her?

507
00:39:07,744 --> 00:39:11,746
One minute.
God, please let it be her.

508
00:39:12,247 --> 00:39:15,537
Call her, not god.
See...

509
00:39:25,793 --> 00:39:27,383
Yes!

510
00:39:28,424 --> 00:39:31,596
Yes, sister. That's her.
Thank you, sister.

511
00:39:32,215 --> 00:39:34,797
Please hold my bag for a bit.

512
00:39:35,177 --> 00:39:37,928
He is crazy.

513
00:39:38,098 --> 00:39:39,850
Why are you smiling?

514
00:39:39,850 --> 00:39:41,850
But he still called you sister.

515
00:39:43,681 --> 00:39:45,643
Hey! Let's go.

516
00:39:46,102 --> 00:39:49,764
I'll give you this rose.
And I'll say I love you.

517
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:53,266
In return you have to just say
I love you too.

518
00:39:53,356 --> 00:39:54,356
Clear?

519
00:39:55,607 --> 00:39:57,018
Let's try.

520
00:39:58,018 --> 00:39:59,519
I love you.

521
00:40:00,859 --> 00:40:02,561
I love you.

522
00:40:07,773 --> 00:40:09,023
What the fish?

523
00:40:09,023 --> 00:40:12,025
Feel it... Feelings, bro...

524
00:40:12,025 --> 00:40:13,316
What feelings?

525
00:40:17,988 --> 00:40:21,029
You came into my life like a dream.

526
00:40:21,409 --> 00:40:23,490
And you left me in the dream.

527
00:40:24,241 --> 00:40:26,492
I have met you after such a long time.

528
00:40:26,912 --> 00:40:30,574
I don't know if this is a dream or reality.

529
00:40:30,783 --> 00:40:32,785
If this is reality...

530
00:40:34,495 --> 00:40:36,786
Then accept this rose.

531
00:40:36,786 --> 00:40:40,498
And if this is a dream, wake me up.

532
00:40:49,963 --> 00:40:51,133
Stop it.

533
00:40:52,044 --> 00:40:54,885
Hey, what are you doing?

534
00:40:55,216 --> 00:40:57,256
Are you trying to act smart
in front of your seniors?

535
00:40:57,337 --> 00:40:59,547
Relax, boss.
I know her from before.

536
00:40:59,587 --> 00:41:00,588
So what?

537
00:41:00,588 --> 00:41:02,929
That's why you'll talk to her?

538
00:41:03,219 --> 00:41:05,841
Why? What's wrong in talking?

539
00:41:05,841 --> 00:41:08,642
I'll tell you what the problem is.

540
00:41:08,682 --> 00:41:10,933
You will not talk to her.

541
00:41:11,684 --> 00:41:13,934
I will talk to her.

542
00:41:15,395 --> 00:41:19,647
I will not let you talk to her.

543
00:41:19,687 --> 00:41:22,519
Fine. Challenge accepted.

544
00:41:24,809 --> 00:41:26,850
What do you mean by, "Challenge accepted"?

545
00:41:32,903 --> 00:41:35,945
If you can hold on to my collar
for the next one minute...

546
00:41:35,945 --> 00:41:37,605
...then I promise...

547
00:41:38,066 --> 00:41:40,817
I'll never talk to this girl again
in my entire life.

548
00:41:41,277 --> 00:41:41,948
Okay.

549
00:41:41,948 --> 00:41:44,739
Bro, the principal is coming this way.

550
00:41:44,739 --> 00:41:48,321
Let him go.
We'll deal with him later.

551
00:41:48,321 --> 00:41:50,202
What are you doing?
The principal is coming.

552
00:41:50,202 --> 00:41:51,912
Let him go.

553
00:41:52,743 --> 00:41:54,034
Let him go, bro.

554
00:41:55,164 --> 00:41:56,995
40 seconds to go.

555
00:42:00,206 --> 00:42:01,207
Suresh...

556
00:42:01,707 --> 00:42:03,538
You'll be in trouble...
Let him go...

557
00:42:04,829 --> 00:42:07,330
Why is your hand trembling?

558
00:42:08,121 --> 00:42:11,371
Let him go or the principal
will suspend you.

559
00:42:13,963 --> 00:42:15,124
Let go...

560
00:42:16,964 --> 00:42:18,425
Suresh...

561
00:42:18,716 --> 00:42:19,876
Will you let him go?

562
00:42:24,298 --> 00:42:30,801
If you held on to my collar for a little longer
I would have never spoken to her again.

563
00:42:31,631 --> 00:42:35,383
Bad luck.
Now, I'm going to talk to her.

564
00:42:36,974 --> 00:42:41,437
Khushi, you'll never speak to him again.

565
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:51,891
Leave.

566
00:43:16,993 --> 00:43:19,074
Hi!

567
00:43:40,295 --> 00:43:42,295
Stop bugging me.

568
00:43:43,545 --> 00:43:47,418
Ishaan, finish these assignments.

569
00:43:47,588 --> 00:43:49,298
Really not in mood.
Can I do it later?

570
00:43:49,298 --> 00:43:52,340
I am not asking you.
I'm telling you to finish it.

571
00:43:54,551 --> 00:43:58,013
- What are you waiting for?
- I'm going...

572
00:43:58,553 --> 00:44:00,634
Hey, where are you going?

573
00:44:00,634 --> 00:44:01,595
To help him.

574
00:44:01,595 --> 00:44:05,347
Sit here and finish these assignments.

575
00:44:09,888 --> 00:44:11,729
Thank you, sister!

576
00:44:12,430 --> 00:44:14,851
Go on... Go...

577
00:44:15,851 --> 00:44:18,353
What are you smiling at?
Finish the work.

578
00:44:21,234 --> 00:44:24,436
What's with the attitude?

579
00:44:24,436 --> 00:44:26,066
Why aren't you talking to me?

580
00:44:26,066 --> 00:44:28,607
- What about the seniors?
- What about them?

581
00:44:28,607 --> 00:44:30,988
I've been looking all over for you
for the last three months.

582
00:44:30,988 --> 00:44:33,990
Facebook, Twitter... I couldn't find you anywhere.

583
00:44:33,990 --> 00:44:39,362
I was being harassed on social media.
That's why I deleted my accounts.

584
00:44:39,903 --> 00:44:43,445
Excuse me?
Who was harassing you?

585
00:44:43,445 --> 00:44:44,115
Was it me?

586
00:44:44,115 --> 00:44:47,996
Not you... There were others...

587
00:44:49,037 --> 00:44:52,909
- Why? You don't like me?
- Did I say that?

588
00:44:52,909 --> 00:44:55,371
That means you like me...

589
00:44:55,371 --> 00:44:56,951
Did I say that?

590
00:44:56,951 --> 00:45:00,373
Why aren't you saying anything?
Please say something.

591
00:45:02,163 --> 00:45:05,795
Actually, my dad had come to pick me up
at the station that day.

592
00:45:05,795 --> 00:45:09,007
And you were sleeping. So, I didn't wake you...

593
00:45:09,007 --> 00:45:10,257
Were you scared?

594
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:17,461
And what if your dad didn't come
and I was awake?

595
00:45:19,762 --> 00:45:22,884
Tell me, please...

596
00:45:23,803 --> 00:45:27,015
Actually, I had got a free seat at St. Mary's.

597
00:45:27,015 --> 00:45:30,557
But I paid money to get admitted in this college.

598
00:45:31,097 --> 00:45:33,769
Why? Is your father very rich?

599
00:45:33,769 --> 00:45:35,219
No...

600
00:45:37,311 --> 00:45:39,601
When I was putting your stuff back in your bag...

601
00:45:39,601 --> 00:45:41,562
That's when...

602
00:45:45,104 --> 00:45:47,685
I saw your college admission letter.

603
00:45:49,686 --> 00:45:50,817
What?

604
00:45:55,148 --> 00:45:56,690
Hey, Khushi...

605
00:45:56,940 --> 00:45:59,361
That means you joined this college for me?

606
00:45:59,901 --> 00:46:01,071
That means you love me.

607
00:46:01,071 --> 00:46:03,783
Hello, slow down.
What's your hurry?

608
00:46:03,783 --> 00:46:05,404
When you love someone...

609
00:46:05,404 --> 00:46:06,904
...and when they love you back...

610
00:46:06,904 --> 00:46:08,405
There's a different kick in it.

611
00:46:08,405 --> 00:46:10,787
I'm not here to "kick" you.

612
00:46:10,787 --> 00:46:12,157
Really? Then what?

613
00:46:12,537 --> 00:46:15,328
I heard this college is great in academics.

614
00:46:15,789 --> 00:46:18,120
- Okay, bye.
- Okay, I love you too.

615
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:21,241
I said bye.

616
00:46:21,241 --> 00:46:22,621
I heard something else.

617
00:46:22,621 --> 00:46:24,083
You're mad.

618
00:46:25,043 --> 00:46:26,454
Love you.

619
00:46:36,838 --> 00:46:39,960
Hi, this is my friend, Rahul.

620
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:42,921
I remember. He's the one
you were speaking to on the train.

621
00:46:43,172 --> 00:46:45,092
Yeah...

622
00:46:45,382 --> 00:46:47,304
Hey, nice to meet you, brother.

623
00:46:47,384 --> 00:46:49,055
Brother?

624
00:46:49,215 --> 00:46:52,426
Your friend will be my brother, right?

625
00:46:54,177 --> 00:46:58,309
You've made my friend your brother.
When are you going to say that you love me?

626
00:46:59,009 --> 00:47:01,181
But why am I her brother?

627
00:47:01,181 --> 00:47:03,011
Did you take Khushi's number?

628
00:47:03,812 --> 00:47:04,812
I forgot.

629
00:47:04,812 --> 00:47:05,853
What's wrong with you?

630
00:47:05,853 --> 00:47:09,184
You know what, communication
is important in any relationship.

631
00:47:09,224 --> 00:47:11,645
Who will you talk to now?
The wall?

632
00:47:12,186 --> 00:47:14,267
India is so polluted.

633
00:47:14,267 --> 00:47:17,729
Look at the dust on this car.
And there's a number on it.

634
00:47:19,109 --> 00:47:21,019
Hey, stop!

635
00:47:23,271 --> 00:47:24,942
What did I do?

636
00:47:25,072 --> 00:47:27,152
- The number...
- Yeah, number so what?

637
00:47:27,363 --> 00:47:29,824
Bro, that was Khushi's number.

638
00:47:31,615 --> 00:47:34,326
Extremely sorry... Sorry, sorry, sorry...

639
00:47:34,527 --> 00:47:38,658
98705 or 706...

640
00:47:44,081 --> 00:47:45,742
Hello? Who's this?

641
00:47:45,742 --> 00:47:47,743
Why didn't you call me?

642
00:47:48,623 --> 00:47:49,333
Khushi?

643
00:47:49,373 --> 00:47:50,334
Yeah.

644
00:47:51,375 --> 00:47:53,996
Your number got wiped off.
All thanks to Rahul.

645
00:47:54,166 --> 00:47:56,957
By the way, how did you get my number?

646
00:47:56,997 --> 00:47:58,538
I have my ways.

647
00:47:58,538 --> 00:47:59,839
Okay.

648
00:48:01,249 --> 00:48:02,210
Anyway...

649
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:03,590
Have you reached home?

650
00:48:05,171 --> 00:48:06,421
Okay, bye.

651
00:48:06,671 --> 00:48:07,842
Okay, I love you too.

652
00:48:07,842 --> 00:48:09,883
What? I said bye.

653
00:48:09,923 --> 00:48:11,964
But I heard something else.

654
00:48:12,544 --> 00:48:13,465
Stupid...

655
00:48:13,675 --> 00:48:15,136
Love you. Bye.

656
00:48:36,645 --> 00:48:38,687
Actually, I was born in London.

657
00:48:38,687 --> 00:48:40,898
Dad was a professor at St. Morris.

658
00:48:40,898 --> 00:48:43,359
That's where he met my mom
and they fell in love.

659
00:48:43,359 --> 00:48:45,810
Have you seen my IT files?

660
00:48:45,810 --> 00:48:46,941
No, I haven't.

661
00:48:46,941 --> 00:48:48,942
I need them urgently...

662
00:48:48,942 --> 00:48:52,234
I had kept them in the drawer.
Did you check properly?

663
00:48:54,564 --> 00:48:56,815
- Where have you kept them?
- I can't deal with so many things...

664
00:48:59,316 --> 00:49:01,118
Ishaan, see this.

665
00:49:01,408 --> 00:49:03,199
I got my UK visa.

666
00:49:03,489 --> 00:49:05,620
- Oh, wow!
- Congratulations!

667
00:49:05,620 --> 00:49:07,490
- Congratulations!
- Thank you!

668
00:49:07,781 --> 00:49:09,662
Take care of my friend.

669
00:49:09,662 --> 00:49:13,323
I love him a lot. Not like you.
But I do...

670
00:49:14,124 --> 00:49:15,784
- Bye... - Bye...
- See you later...

671
00:49:24,038 --> 00:49:26,250
You're missing Rahul a lot, aren't you?

672
00:49:27,380 --> 00:49:28,211
No, I'm fine.

673
00:49:28,211 --> 00:49:29,581
Khushi!

674
00:49:29,581 --> 00:49:31,462
Hey! Watch out!

675
00:49:32,083 --> 00:49:33,923
Let's see...
Who do you think you are?

676
00:49:34,174 --> 00:49:36,334
- Sorry, I'm really very sorry...
- Are you blind?

677
00:49:36,334 --> 00:49:38,886
- I'm so so sorry...
- What are you sorry about?

678
00:49:39,006 --> 00:49:40,926
Why are you apologizing, Khushi?

679
00:49:41,337 --> 00:49:43,758
You were driving on the wrong side
and you're only screaming?

680
00:49:43,758 --> 00:49:45,299
Why are you meddling?

681
00:49:45,299 --> 00:49:47,890
- But I said sorry...
- Just because you said sorry...

682
00:49:48,551 --> 00:49:50,141
You don't know how to talk to women?

683
00:49:50,141 --> 00:49:53,933
Ishaan, let him go...
Please don't fight.

684
00:49:53,933 --> 00:49:56,224
But they are wrong...

685
00:49:56,224 --> 00:49:59,346
Ishaan, please don't fight... Please let it go.

686
00:49:59,346 --> 00:50:00,686
Ishaan, let it be.

687
00:50:01,016 --> 00:50:03,557
Please... for me...

688
00:50:04,398 --> 00:50:06,058
My swear...

689
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:11,521
Sit in the car. I'll drive.

690
00:50:26,949 --> 00:50:29,160
Control your anger, Ishaan.

691
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:31,450
You have to manage your anger issues, please.

692
00:50:31,450 --> 00:50:32,952
You shouldn't be so impulsive.

693
00:50:32,952 --> 00:50:35,493
Why do you have to react to every small thing?

694
00:50:35,493 --> 00:50:37,203
I don't like it at all.

695
00:50:37,494 --> 00:50:39,244
I don't like it, either.

696
00:50:39,534 --> 00:50:41,076
- What?
- All this.

697
00:50:41,706 --> 00:50:43,707
That fact that you haven't said
you love me.

698
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:45,247
I don't like it either.

699
00:50:45,247 --> 00:50:47,788
When a boy proposes...

700
00:50:47,788 --> 00:50:50,830
And the girl says she'll think about it...

701
00:50:50,830 --> 00:50:53,501
You can assume that she has already decided
to say yes.

702
00:50:53,501 --> 00:50:54,922
But we don't say it out loud.

703
00:50:54,922 --> 00:50:55,833
Why?

704
00:50:56,332 --> 00:50:59,334
The way hearing "I love you"
gives you a kick...

705
00:50:59,544 --> 00:51:03,086
I get a kick out of not accepting it.

706
00:51:03,796 --> 00:51:06,127
When a boy is interested in a girl...

707
00:51:06,127 --> 00:51:09,339
Do you know how satisfying it is
to the ego?

708
00:51:10,379 --> 00:51:12,800
All girls love it
when the guy is chasing her.

709
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:15,092
It's a girl thing.
You won't understand.

710
00:51:15,431 --> 00:51:18,513
That means you girls want us guys to...

711
00:51:18,513 --> 00:51:20,304
...run after you all our lives.

712
00:51:20,304 --> 00:51:21,805
Do you doubt it?

713
00:51:24,136 --> 00:51:25,477
Hey, Khushi...

714
00:51:27,768 --> 00:51:29,309
You have to say it today.

715
00:51:29,309 --> 00:51:30,889
Puppy!

716
00:51:34,811 --> 00:51:36,392
You're too funny.

717
00:51:36,772 --> 00:51:40,104
If you can hold my hand like this
for one minute...

718
00:51:40,104 --> 00:51:43,276
Then I'll say what you want to hear.

719
00:51:51,319 --> 00:51:53,070
Ishaan, I was just kidding.

720
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:55,781
Ishaan, let go of my hand.

721
00:51:57,072 --> 00:52:00,203
Ishaan, let go of my hand
or you'll be in trouble.

722
00:52:00,953 --> 00:52:02,864
Let go of my hand, Ishaan.

723
00:52:03,074 --> 00:52:04,535
Ishaan, I was just kidding.

724
00:52:05,206 --> 00:52:07,327
Please, let go.

725
00:52:08,827 --> 00:52:10,498
Ishaan, please let go.

726
00:52:10,498 --> 00:52:13,460
There'll be a lot of problem...
Please let go.

727
00:52:14,039 --> 00:52:16,211
What are you doing?

728
00:52:16,461 --> 00:52:18,212
Are you bullying her?

729
00:52:18,792 --> 00:52:22,874
Three... Two... One...

730
00:52:25,166 --> 00:52:26,546
Now, say it.

731
00:52:26,796 --> 00:52:30,418
I told you I'll say it.
Not that I'll say it right now.

732
00:52:30,418 --> 00:52:32,509
How long are you going to keep me hanging?

733
00:52:38,512 --> 00:52:39,471
What?

734
00:52:40,302 --> 00:52:43,424
That day, if you could hold on to my collar
for just five more seconds...

735
00:52:43,424 --> 00:52:45,975
...then you wouldn't have to see this day.

736
00:52:54,599 --> 00:52:55,979
Let's go to the cafe.

737
00:52:57,350 --> 00:52:59,601
Suresh, just look at him.

738
00:53:00,642 --> 00:53:03,023
Hey, Khushi!

739
00:53:17,901 --> 00:53:19,281
Do you know what is today?

740
00:53:19,281 --> 00:53:20,192
No.

741
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:23,113
Today is Rakhi, festival for siblings.

742
00:53:23,193 --> 00:53:27,034
Every girl in the college is tying the holy string
on the person she considers brother.

743
00:53:27,114 --> 00:53:29,495
- But today is not Rakhi...
- I know...

744
00:53:29,495 --> 00:53:33,788
It's a custom, basically...
See there...

745
00:53:34,288 --> 00:53:35,789
See that girl.

746
00:53:36,539 --> 00:53:41,872
And you'll tie the rakhi on this cute boy here.

747
00:53:41,872 --> 00:53:43,952
- Hey...
- Hey... Hey...

748
00:53:43,952 --> 00:53:46,704
Cooperate for a bit.
It'll be over soon.

749
00:53:46,704 --> 00:53:47,955
Sod off.

750
00:53:48,165 --> 00:53:50,005
No, I won't do it.

751
00:53:50,005 --> 00:53:51,836
You have to.

752
00:53:52,587 --> 00:53:54,008
I will not do it!

753
00:53:54,258 --> 00:53:55,628
You have to!

754
00:53:55,628 --> 00:53:57,879
I said I will not!

755
00:54:05,133 --> 00:54:06,633
I will tie the Rakhi on you.

756
00:54:06,633 --> 00:54:09,465
And I will tie it on him and him and him too...

757
00:54:09,515 --> 00:54:12,306
I'll tie a rakhi on each
and every boy in college.

758
00:54:12,306 --> 00:54:14,217
But not on him.

759
00:54:15,308 --> 00:54:17,428
Because I love him.

760
00:54:21,351 --> 00:54:24,142
Ishaan, I love you.

761
00:54:46,823 --> 00:54:54,156
I can become a new man
If you want me to be

762
00:54:54,536 --> 00:55:02,120
I can become a wave
If you are the sea

763
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:09,624
I can become lost in thought
Everytime they talk about you

764
00:55:10,123 --> 00:55:17,628
I can be lost in the clouds
If you are the sky so blue

765
00:55:18,297 --> 00:55:28,503
Your fragrance drives me crazy
Dusk to dawn, unknowingly

766
00:55:28,503 --> 00:55:33,385
I am so lost without you

767
00:55:33,385 --> 00:55:43,639
Your smile brings rhythm
In my heart, unknowingly

768
00:55:43,930 --> 00:55:49,512
I am so lost without you

769
00:56:04,610 --> 00:56:05,691
Really?

770
00:56:07,611 --> 00:56:08,362
Ishaan.

771
00:56:08,362 --> 00:56:12,654
Yes, Mom..
Mom, this is... Khushi...

772
00:56:12,654 --> 00:56:14,274
My friend.

773
00:56:15,025 --> 00:56:16,196
Who?

774
00:56:17,075 --> 00:56:18,236
Close friend.

775
00:56:18,326 --> 00:56:19,577
Close friend?

776
00:56:20,117 --> 00:56:22,908
Like you and Rahul?

777
00:56:23,739 --> 00:56:26,450
No, aunty. Like you and uncle.

778
00:56:35,415 --> 00:56:41,878
Have you ever thought

779
00:56:41,918 --> 00:56:50,922
How far we've come in love

780
00:56:50,922 --> 00:56:57,385
Have you ever heard closely

781
00:56:57,385 --> 00:57:07,510
The birds singing about your love

782
00:57:07,510 --> 00:57:17,725
Your fragrance drives me crazy
Dusk to dawn, unknowingly

783
00:57:17,725 --> 00:57:22,607
I am so lost without you

784
00:57:22,607 --> 00:57:32,862
Your smile brings rhythm
In my heart, unknowingly

785
00:57:33,152 --> 00:57:38,735
I am so lost without you

786
00:58:04,377 --> 00:58:05,628
Yeah.

787
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:10,500
Why did you stop the car here?

788
00:58:10,881 --> 00:58:12,291
It's safe here now.

789
00:58:12,711 --> 00:58:15,172
What if your dad sees us?

790
00:58:15,172 --> 00:58:16,333
No one will see us.

791
00:58:16,333 --> 00:58:18,754
My dad will think I'm home.

792
00:58:18,754 --> 00:58:20,384
Okay...

793
00:58:22,136 --> 00:58:24,257
Then we can happily...

794
00:58:24,297 --> 00:58:26,047
...comfortably...

795
00:58:26,718 --> 00:58:30,010
For as long as we want...

796
00:58:30,470 --> 00:58:32,010
We can chat.

797
00:58:33,301 --> 00:58:34,301
Okay...

798
00:58:43,306 --> 00:58:44,557
What was that sound?

799
00:58:44,557 --> 00:58:45,597
Nothing.

800
00:58:49,519 --> 00:58:50,599
Chocolates?

801
00:58:50,599 --> 00:58:52,400
No, I hate chocolates.

802
00:58:54,151 --> 00:58:56,352
What is he so scared of?

803
00:59:02,655 --> 00:59:03,606
Khushi?

804
00:59:05,066 --> 00:59:06,607
Can I...

805
00:59:08,608 --> 00:59:10,158
Can I kiss you?

806
00:59:12,610 --> 00:59:15,241
Yes! Yes! Yes!

807
00:59:15,571 --> 00:59:16,992
Ishaan...

808
00:59:17,072 --> 00:59:19,243
It won't be right.

809
00:59:19,913 --> 00:59:21,494
Okay, fine.

810
00:59:25,116 --> 00:59:28,708
Khushi, just once... Please...

811
00:59:29,078 --> 00:59:30,288
Okay.

812
00:59:30,958 --> 00:59:32,459
Only one...

813
00:59:32,459 --> 00:59:33,830
Yeah, okay...

814
00:59:33,830 --> 00:59:35,120
A small one.

815
00:59:35,170 --> 00:59:36,791
Yeah, fine...

816
00:59:49,008 --> 00:59:54,010
- I didn't do anything...
- Hey, hey, hey... It's okay.

817
00:59:54,130 --> 00:59:55,630
No one heard that.

818
00:59:56,471 --> 00:59:57,631
It's okay.

819
01:00:02,934 --> 01:00:04,094
Khushi...

820
01:00:06,635 --> 01:00:07,976
I kissed you.

821
01:00:09,186 --> 01:00:10,347
When?

822
01:00:11,268 --> 01:00:12,598
What do you mean?

823
01:00:12,598 --> 01:00:15,189
Just right now...

824
01:00:15,390 --> 01:00:16,481
Where?

825
01:00:16,771 --> 01:00:21,603
What do you mean by where?
On your cheek...

826
01:00:21,853 --> 01:00:23,523
Is that enough for you?

827
01:00:24,064 --> 01:00:27,236
You only said a small one... So...

828
01:00:28,195 --> 01:00:29,947
What are you so scared of?

829
01:00:30,818 --> 01:00:31,897
Oh my god!

830
01:00:33,399 --> 01:00:34,529
Last chance to decide...

831
01:00:34,739 --> 01:00:36,860
If you kiss me,
you'll have to marry me.

832
01:00:38,151 --> 01:00:39,031
Ishaan!

833
01:00:39,031 --> 01:00:40,902
I didn't hear what you said.

834
01:00:40,902 --> 01:00:42,532
What did you just do?

835
01:00:42,532 --> 01:00:43,533
Just...

836
01:00:43,953 --> 01:00:45,153
One minute.

837
01:00:46,114 --> 01:00:47,365
Hey, it's 12 o'clock.

838
01:00:47,405 --> 01:00:48,285
So?

839
01:00:49,206 --> 01:00:50,616
Happy birthday!

840
01:00:50,616 --> 01:00:51,577
Thank you.

841
01:00:51,577 --> 01:00:54,618
But I'll give you your gift tomorrow.

842
01:00:54,618 --> 01:00:55,709
I don't want a gift.

843
01:00:56,119 --> 01:00:56,829
Why?

844
01:00:57,210 --> 01:00:58,541
I have you...

845
01:00:58,581 --> 01:00:59,581
What do you mean?

846
01:00:59,621 --> 01:01:01,082
I'll explain...

847
01:01:38,019 --> 01:01:39,520
When did you get here?

848
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:40,481
Just a while back.

849
01:01:40,481 --> 01:01:42,271
Do you only eat chocolates?

850
01:01:42,271 --> 01:01:43,812
I love chocolates.

851
01:01:44,232 --> 01:01:46,143
I hate chocolates.

852
01:01:46,143 --> 01:01:48,524
Why? What's wrong with chocolates?

853
01:01:48,524 --> 01:01:49,815
Just don't like it.

854
01:01:51,606 --> 01:01:53,647
Have one for me.

855
01:01:53,777 --> 01:01:55,567
- I don't want it, Khushi...
- Please take a bite.

856
01:01:55,567 --> 01:01:57,898
- No, please...
- Just one bite...

857
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:03,401
You threw away my chocolate?

858
01:02:03,651 --> 01:02:05,112
Yes...

859
01:02:06,282 --> 01:02:07,243
Okay.

860
01:02:08,823 --> 01:02:09,404
Now...

861
01:02:09,404 --> 01:02:10,575
What's this?

862
01:02:10,575 --> 01:02:12,285
- Now? Come on...
- What are you doing?

863
01:02:12,285 --> 01:02:13,787
- What are you doing?
- You have to take a bite...

864
01:02:15,327 --> 01:02:16,828
He's saying no...

865
01:02:16,828 --> 01:02:18,368
Why are you forcing him?

866
01:02:19,039 --> 01:02:20,199
Let him be.

867
01:02:34,256 --> 01:02:35,757
Should I try?

868
01:02:36,007 --> 01:02:37,708
Ishaan, please...

869
01:02:37,708 --> 01:02:40,009
This is not the right time...
Let's go.

870
01:02:40,009 --> 01:02:43,010
Ishaan, it's not a good time...
Let's go...

871
01:02:48,342 --> 01:02:52,015
Wow! Beautiful!

872
01:02:52,015 --> 01:02:53,675
It's great how you've kept him in control.

873
01:02:53,675 --> 01:02:54,596
See...

874
01:02:54,966 --> 01:02:58,098
If you give me some of your chocolate
I can be under your control too...

875
01:03:05,181 --> 01:03:08,222
Stop it! Stop it!
Ishaan... Ishaan... Stop it!

876
01:03:08,222 --> 01:03:09,974
Cool...cool...stop it!

877
01:03:09,974 --> 01:03:12,184
Stop, please! Stop it!

878
01:03:12,184 --> 01:03:13,685
Stop...

879
01:03:22,109 --> 01:03:24,900
Khushi, I'm really sorry... Really sorry...

880
01:03:30,983 --> 01:03:32,403
I didn't see it, bro...

881
01:03:35,735 --> 01:03:37,907
It wasn't intentional, bro...

882
01:03:45,040 --> 01:03:47,831
Ishaan! Ishaan, stop!

883
01:03:54,585 --> 01:03:56,335
Suresh, what's wrong?

884
01:03:57,126 --> 01:03:58,586
Get up... Get up...

885
01:03:59,207 --> 01:04:00,797
I am going to finish him off today.

886
01:04:01,998 --> 01:04:02,919
Go, get him...

887
01:04:03,128 --> 01:04:04,299
Don't let him go...

888
01:05:02,577 --> 01:05:05,118
Run... Run... He's coming this way...

889
01:05:43,006 --> 01:05:44,217
Ishaan, let go...

890
01:05:44,217 --> 01:05:46,258
- Ishaan, let go of him...
- Stop it!

891
01:05:46,258 --> 01:05:48,509
Ishaan, stop it! Stop it!

892
01:05:50,139 --> 01:05:53,261
Does the prestige of the college
mean anything to you?

893
01:05:53,261 --> 01:05:57,683
Do you even know how this behaviour
effects the other students?

894
01:05:57,683 --> 01:06:00,764
Even the goons on the streets
don't fight like this.

895
01:06:01,055 --> 01:06:04,186
What happened?
Who started the fight?

896
01:06:04,186 --> 01:06:05,437
Sir, he started it.

897
01:06:05,808 --> 01:06:07,058
He hit me first.

898
01:06:07,058 --> 01:06:08,559
Hey, don't lie.

899
01:06:08,768 --> 01:06:11,360
Sir, he misbehaved with Khushi.
That's why I hit him.

900
01:06:12,020 --> 01:06:14,061
Sir, do you know what they were doing?

901
01:06:14,811 --> 01:06:15,942
- Ishaan...
- Look at him, sir!

902
01:06:15,942 --> 01:06:18,153
Behave yourself!
Stop it!

903
01:06:18,403 --> 01:06:20,234
Khushi, tell me what happened?

904
01:06:20,234 --> 01:06:22,485
Did Suresh misbehave with you?

905
01:06:35,321 --> 01:06:36,661
No, sir.

906
01:06:38,533 --> 01:06:40,874
Weren't you there when the scuffle started?

907
01:06:41,665 --> 01:06:42,744
Yes, sir.

908
01:06:43,245 --> 01:06:47,247
What were you and Ishaan doing there?

909
01:06:47,247 --> 01:06:48,577
Sir...

910
01:06:49,668 --> 01:06:51,919
Don't try to act innocenet.

911
01:06:51,919 --> 01:06:54,881
I've heard about the two of you...

912
01:06:55,541 --> 01:06:57,081
It's not like that, sir.

913
01:06:57,081 --> 01:06:59,082
Ishaan and I are friends.

914
01:06:59,082 --> 01:07:01,294
We were discussing the Physics paper.

915
01:07:01,294 --> 01:07:03,385
That's when Suresh came...

916
01:07:03,965 --> 01:07:07,137
They started fighting over
the freshers' party...

917
01:07:07,336 --> 01:07:08,337
Then...

918
01:07:08,337 --> 01:07:10,548
Then what about your dress?

919
01:07:10,638 --> 01:07:12,259
How did it tear?

920
01:07:17,051 --> 01:07:19,472
It tore when I tried to stop their fight.

921
01:07:20,473 --> 01:07:22,894
So, Ishaan started the fight?

922
01:07:30,057 --> 01:07:31,148
Yes, sir.

923
01:07:31,148 --> 01:07:34,099
I didn't expect this from you, Ishaan.

924
01:07:34,099 --> 01:07:37,481
A girl has been maligned
because of you.

925
01:08:28,875 --> 01:08:30,466
What are you doing here?

926
01:08:32,627 --> 01:08:34,428
Why aren't you answering my calls?

927
01:08:37,049 --> 01:08:39,470
Khushi, I don't feel like
talking to you right now.

928
01:08:40,681 --> 01:08:42,092
Ishaan, please...

929
01:08:45,263 --> 01:08:47,475
I told you I don't feel like talking.

930
01:08:47,475 --> 01:08:50,436
I might just say something out of anger
that will hurt you.

931
01:08:51,136 --> 01:08:52,767
We don't need all this.

932
01:08:53,137 --> 01:08:54,478
We'll talk tomorrow.

933
01:08:55,058 --> 01:08:57,269
Just five minutes.
That's all I'm asking for.

934
01:09:02,061 --> 01:09:03,602
Talk to this.

935
01:09:06,484 --> 01:09:08,855
Don't talk to me like that.
I'm your girlfriend.

936
01:09:10,275 --> 01:09:11,606
Oh really?

937
01:09:12,316 --> 01:09:14,527
But you just said we're friends.

938
01:09:14,527 --> 01:09:16,818
Whatever happened there
was your mistake.

939
01:09:17,239 --> 01:09:18,819
Don't blame me for that.

940
01:09:19,990 --> 01:09:22,031
- What?
- Yes.

941
01:09:22,491 --> 01:09:26,033
I asked you not to
but you still picked up a fight with Suresh.

942
01:09:26,033 --> 01:09:28,074
And the matter escalated to the principal.

943
01:09:28,654 --> 01:09:31,325
I fought with him because
he misbehaved with you.

944
01:09:31,656 --> 01:09:32,956
Then whose fault is it?

945
01:09:32,956 --> 01:09:34,157
Mine or his?

946
01:09:34,787 --> 01:09:35,367
It's his fault.

947
01:09:35,367 --> 01:09:37,288
Then, why didn't you say so
in front of the principal?

948
01:09:37,288 --> 01:09:38,909
Why did you make me look bad
in front of everyone?

949
01:09:38,909 --> 01:09:40,160
Don't shout, Ishaan.

950
01:09:40,160 --> 01:09:42,621
If I complained about Suresh then...

951
01:09:42,621 --> 01:09:45,712
...he would have told the principal
what we're doing there.

952
01:09:45,752 --> 01:09:47,833
And my parents would come to know.

953
01:09:47,913 --> 01:09:48,874
Yeah... So?

954
01:09:49,164 --> 01:09:51,795
You've proposed to me in front
of the entire college.

955
01:09:52,335 --> 01:09:54,797
We've made out in the car
in front of your house...

956
01:09:58,219 --> 01:10:00,800
What was the big deal if the principal
got to know about us?

957
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:03,131
For that matter, even your parents?

958
01:10:03,131 --> 01:10:07,473
My parents would have been okay with it
if I gave them the news.

959
01:10:07,883 --> 01:10:11,555
But if the principal has to inform them
then our love is wrong.

960
01:10:12,226 --> 01:10:13,886
You don't care about all this.

961
01:10:14,016 --> 01:10:16,808
Because you just don't care
about the consequences.

962
01:10:17,058 --> 01:10:19,139
You don't think about anything at all.

963
01:10:20,139 --> 01:10:21,640
You're right.

964
01:10:21,640 --> 01:10:23,931
I only do things that I want to do.

965
01:10:24,231 --> 01:10:26,232
And I know it's the right thing to do.

966
01:10:26,312 --> 01:10:31,025
I don't calculate my moves according
to the situation in love like you.

967
01:10:31,025 --> 01:10:32,895
How dare you say that?

968
01:10:33,606 --> 01:10:35,937
My love for you is a calculative move?

969
01:10:36,687 --> 01:10:38,438
I finally understand...

970
01:10:38,858 --> 01:10:42,280
You didn't have a problem with someone
misbehaving with me.

971
01:10:43,110 --> 01:10:44,571
Your problem is that...

972
01:10:44,571 --> 01:10:47,112
...your ego was hurt in the principal's office.

973
01:10:47,112 --> 01:10:50,284
And that's why you're creating
a scene unnecessarily.

974
01:10:50,694 --> 01:10:53,325
I am the one creating a scene?

975
01:10:53,325 --> 01:10:56,996
Khushi, he misbehaved with you...

976
01:10:56,996 --> 01:10:58,287
All that is okay with you?

977
01:10:58,287 --> 01:11:00,448
You're absolutely fine with it?

978
01:11:03,580 --> 01:11:09,082
You said once that all girls love
when a boy is chasing her.

979
01:11:09,082 --> 01:11:12,504
It satisfies your ego when a boy is
following you around.

980
01:11:12,754 --> 01:11:15,956
That means you must have liked it
when he touched you.

981
01:11:16,335 --> 01:11:18,377
You loved it... Enjoyed it...
Didn't you?

982
01:11:32,093 --> 01:11:34,805
I was talking about you chasing me...

983
01:11:34,845 --> 01:11:37,056
Not some stranger...

984
01:11:37,266 --> 01:11:39,387
This is the problem with you, Ishaan.

985
01:11:39,387 --> 01:11:41,597
You don't think about
what you're blurting out.

986
01:11:41,597 --> 01:11:43,809
Something that can be settled
with a few words...

987
01:11:43,809 --> 01:11:46,430
You've made it into such a huge issue...

988
01:11:46,430 --> 01:11:48,932
Where have you stretched it to?

989
01:11:49,472 --> 01:11:51,102
I hate you, Ishaan.

990
01:11:51,313 --> 01:11:53,643
You're the biggest mistake of my life.

991
01:11:54,524 --> 01:11:58,065
You can be so angry because
of something small I said.

992
01:11:59,026 --> 01:12:04,188
And you expect me to tolerate someone
misbehaving with the person I love?

993
01:12:07,940 --> 01:12:09,481
You're right.

994
01:12:09,861 --> 01:12:11,693
I don't think before I speak.

995
01:12:11,693 --> 01:12:13,903
But whatever I say,
I say the right thing.

996
01:12:13,983 --> 01:12:16,364
I asked you not to give me the chocolate.

997
01:12:17,235 --> 01:12:19,236
You didn't listen to me.
You insisted.

998
01:12:19,866 --> 01:12:21,907
And that's why we have come to this situation.

999
01:12:23,738 --> 01:12:25,619
I didn't start this, Khushi.

1000
01:12:26,329 --> 01:12:28,451
But I'll end this.

1001
01:12:29,741 --> 01:12:31,162
I fought for you.

1002
01:12:31,162 --> 01:12:33,042
I'm hurt because of you.

1003
01:12:33,453 --> 01:12:34,833
This is not my ego.

1004
01:12:36,704 --> 01:12:38,455
This is my love.

1005
01:12:40,666 --> 01:12:43,047
But now I don't care
if you get it or not.

1006
01:12:43,047 --> 01:12:44,588
Because I really don't care.

1007
01:12:44,588 --> 01:12:45,838
Because I'm done...

1008
01:12:46,168 --> 01:12:47,800
...fighting with you...

1009
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:49,590
...and fighting for you.

1010
01:12:59,055 --> 01:13:00,886
I'm breaking up with you, Khushi.

1011
01:13:03,006 --> 01:13:04,758
You don't deserve this.

1012
01:13:08,469 --> 01:13:10,100
Now, go to hell!

1013
01:13:22,105 --> 01:13:25,477
SIX YEARS AFTER THE BREAK UP

1014
01:13:31,150 --> 01:13:35,573
We should pay attention to the youth.

1015
01:13:37,363 --> 01:13:40,195
- Our time is gone...
- You're right.

1016
01:13:40,195 --> 01:13:42,275
Let's see what they decide.

1017
01:13:42,525 --> 01:13:46,448
We just did whatever our parents
asked us to do...

1018
01:13:49,279 --> 01:13:50,119
Hi!

1019
01:13:50,909 --> 01:13:54,121
Ratul has landed a very good job in Australia.

1020
01:13:54,121 --> 01:13:55,992
Two lakh rupees salary per month...

1021
01:13:56,492 --> 01:13:58,493
Dollars, Mom, Dad...

1022
01:14:00,034 --> 01:14:00,665
Dollars...

1023
01:14:00,665 --> 01:14:03,376
Ishaan, drink the juice.

1024
01:14:03,416 --> 01:14:06,667
Ishaan, stop being a brat.

1025
01:14:06,707 --> 01:14:08,538
Ishaan, what are you doing?

1026
01:14:08,538 --> 01:14:12,089
Please, eat...
Give me the spoon.

1027
01:14:12,089 --> 01:14:13,590
Ishaan... Behave yourself.

1028
01:14:13,590 --> 01:14:15,961
If you finish your food,
I'll give you a chocolate.

1029
01:14:15,961 --> 01:14:20,294
Khushi, do you want to speak to Ratul alone?

1030
01:14:20,423 --> 01:14:21,504
Mom, I'm feeling shy...

1031
01:14:21,504 --> 01:14:23,005
Who is Ratul?

1032
01:14:27,717 --> 01:14:29,177
I'm Ratul.

1033
01:14:29,177 --> 01:14:32,049
Sorry, I forgot.

1034
01:14:32,049 --> 01:14:34,640
No, no, It's okay.
Can happen to anyone.

1035
01:14:36,301 --> 01:14:39,143
I heard you were born in London.

1036
01:14:40,223 --> 01:14:41,894
So, how do you live here?

1037
01:14:42,684 --> 01:14:46,016
I mean the London weather is so brilliant.

1038
01:14:46,016 --> 01:14:47,437
I've been there once.

1039
01:14:47,517 --> 01:14:49,267
Always drizzling.

1040
01:14:49,307 --> 01:14:51,228
It's very hot here.

1041
01:14:52,309 --> 01:14:53,810
Where did you live in London...
Watch out!

1042
01:14:53,810 --> 01:14:55,521
Why are you torturing me, Ishaan?

1043
01:14:55,521 --> 01:14:57,361
Why can't you be a little sensible?

1044
01:14:57,361 --> 01:14:58,482
Ishaan...

1045
01:14:58,732 --> 01:14:59,862
Ishaan...

1046
01:15:02,403 --> 01:15:04,565
Sorry, ma'am.
I am so sorry.

1047
01:15:04,565 --> 01:15:06,235
No, it's okay...

1048
01:15:06,235 --> 01:15:07,816
Ishaan, come with me...

1049
01:15:08,737 --> 01:15:11,738
What are you doing?

1050
01:15:12,198 --> 01:15:14,369
Now, finish your food.

1051
01:15:14,619 --> 01:15:16,990
- Do you know that kid?
- No...

1052
01:15:17,621 --> 01:15:19,031
Then how did you know his name?

1053
01:15:19,371 --> 01:15:22,373
His mom was calling him so...

1054
01:15:23,784 --> 01:15:25,495
Anyway, forget it.

1055
01:15:25,575 --> 01:15:27,206
So, tell me, Raj...

1056
01:15:27,206 --> 01:15:28,286
Raj?

1057
01:15:28,496 --> 01:15:29,537
Aren't you Raj?

1058
01:15:29,787 --> 01:15:31,878
I'm not Raj.
I'm Ratul.

1059
01:15:32,328 --> 01:15:34,169
You forgot again.

1060
01:15:34,209 --> 01:15:36,380
Sorry, it didn't register.

1061
01:15:36,380 --> 01:15:38,041
No, no, it's okay...
It can happen...

1062
01:15:38,041 --> 01:15:39,882
Don't know if it can happen so many times...

1063
01:15:40,172 --> 01:15:41,462
Bye, Khushi.

1064
01:15:42,293 --> 01:15:43,213
Bye, Rono.

1065
01:15:43,213 --> 01:15:44,924
Not Rono... Raj...

1066
01:15:45,835 --> 01:15:47,175
No, no... Ratul...

1067
01:15:47,505 --> 01:15:49,006
Ratul... Ratul...
My name is Ratul...

1068
01:15:49,006 --> 01:15:50,757
My name is Ratul.
Please remember.

1069
01:15:50,757 --> 01:15:51,547
Bye.

1070
01:15:51,717 --> 01:15:53,588
Ratul, Ratul, Ratul, Ratul, Ratul...

1071
01:15:53,588 --> 01:15:54,509
Let's go, Mom.

1072
01:15:54,509 --> 01:15:56,680
- My name is Ratul.
- Yes, let's go.

1073
01:15:57,761 --> 01:15:59,931
Don't be naughty.

1074
01:16:04,263 --> 01:16:09,435
The joy we get when we hear our beloved
say, " I love you"...

1075
01:16:09,435 --> 01:16:13,938
...is nothing compared to the pain of hearing
"I hate you" from her.

1076
01:16:13,938 --> 01:16:16,980
That pain has brought me this far.

1077
01:16:16,980 --> 01:16:19,060
And I came to London...

1078
01:16:24,523 --> 01:16:26,774
There are two ways to be happy in life.

1079
01:16:26,774 --> 01:16:30,446
First is to forgive
the one you can never forget.

1080
01:16:30,446 --> 01:16:34,158
Second is to forget
the one you can never forgive.

1081
01:16:34,158 --> 01:16:36,029
That's what I did.

1082
01:16:37,449 --> 01:16:42,781
I decided I'll stay
where my loved ones are.

1083
01:16:43,202 --> 01:16:47,494
I wanted to win each challenge
I put myself up to.

1084
01:16:47,494 --> 01:16:49,745
However, difficult it was.

1085
01:16:51,165 --> 01:16:53,287
I'm sure you remember Rahul.

1086
01:16:53,287 --> 01:16:56,499
My best friend.
He's my classmate and roommate.

1087
01:16:57,709 --> 01:16:59,210
Ria!

1088
01:16:59,210 --> 01:17:00,420
This is Ria.

1089
01:17:00,420 --> 01:17:03,792
Our landlord's daughter
and Rahul's girlfriend.

1090
01:17:03,792 --> 01:17:07,754
Yes, finally, my friend could find himself
a girlfriend.

1091
01:17:07,754 --> 01:17:09,004
What happened?

1092
01:17:10,715 --> 01:17:11,966
What do you think?

1093
01:17:12,296 --> 01:17:14,587
Is Ishaan going to top the exams?

1094
01:17:15,628 --> 01:17:17,929
I've no idea. No clue.

1095
01:17:17,929 --> 01:17:19,969
All the results are sealed.

1096
01:17:20,680 --> 01:17:22,841
I'm very tensed.

1097
01:17:22,841 --> 01:17:24,472
Aren't we all?

1098
01:17:24,472 --> 01:17:25,932
But our other friend...

1099
01:17:25,932 --> 01:17:28,383
He's already taking bets on it.

1100
01:17:28,634 --> 01:17:31,845
Do you want to bet?
How much do you want to bet?

1101
01:17:31,845 --> 01:17:33,516
- 10 Pounds.
- Okay!

1102
01:17:33,516 --> 01:17:34,687
This is Raju.

1103
01:17:34,687 --> 01:17:36,227
My other rommate.

1104
01:17:36,227 --> 01:17:37,848
It's best if I don't say much about him.

1105
01:17:37,848 --> 01:17:41,389
All you need to know is
that he's addicted to betting.

1106
01:17:41,389 --> 01:17:42,940
Good luck!

1107
01:17:43,191 --> 01:17:44,021
Have you lost your mind?

1108
01:17:44,021 --> 01:17:44,521
Why?

1109
01:17:44,521 --> 01:17:47,102
Your next mistake will cost us
the only aquarium we have left.

1110
01:17:47,102 --> 01:17:49,893
I've not come this far to sell aquariums.

1111
01:17:49,893 --> 01:17:51,645
I'll buy some new ones.

1112
01:17:51,645 --> 01:17:53,355
- 10 Pounds, baby.
- Shut up!

1113
01:17:53,355 --> 01:17:53,986
Where is Ishaan?

1114
01:17:53,986 --> 01:17:55,486
Ishaan, I don't know.

1115
01:17:55,486 --> 01:17:57,067
He's not here.

1116
01:17:57,067 --> 01:17:58,818
Then, please call him.

1117
01:18:00,819 --> 01:18:01,739
Oh my god!

1118
01:18:09,242 --> 01:18:13,455
Ishaan will be in the top three.
He's going for double.

1119
01:18:15,866 --> 01:18:20,209
The third place goes to Greg Milan.

1120
01:18:21,789 --> 01:18:23,830
- Thank you...
- Congratulations!

1121
01:18:23,830 --> 01:18:25,371
Call him again.

1122
01:18:31,414 --> 01:18:34,545
And the second place goes to...

1123
01:18:35,005 --> 01:18:35,836
Call him quick!

1124
01:18:35,836 --> 01:18:38,087
Elisa Angelova.

1125
01:18:38,087 --> 01:18:38,967
He's not answering.

1126
01:18:38,967 --> 01:18:40,628
Well done! Well done!

1127
01:18:41,298 --> 01:18:43,799
- Good job, Elisa.
- Well done.

1128
01:18:44,300 --> 01:18:45,670
Second place is gone too...

1129
01:18:45,670 --> 01:18:46,721
Don't think he has a chance.

1130
01:18:50,053 --> 01:18:54,014
No Indian has ever ranked first
in the university's history.

1131
01:19:00,978 --> 01:19:03,139
Why did Ishaan text "Challenge accepted"?

1132
01:19:03,139 --> 01:19:04,680
Is he crazy?

1133
01:19:12,483 --> 01:19:14,484
And the first place...

1134
01:19:19,146 --> 01:19:21,688
...goes to...

1135
01:19:27,650 --> 01:19:30,072
...Ishaan Chatterjee.

1136
01:19:30,611 --> 01:19:33,403
- Yes! Yes! Yes!
- Ishaan! Ishaan! Ishaan!

1137
01:19:33,403 --> 01:19:39,746
Ishaan! Ishaan! Ishaan! Ishaan!

1138
01:19:43,788 --> 01:19:44,748
Thank you, sir.

1139
01:19:46,700 --> 01:19:47,750
Thank you.

1140
01:19:48,330 --> 01:19:50,871
- Well done, Ishaan, well done.
- Thank you.

1141
01:20:06,629 --> 01:20:09,840
I scored such a hot girl for you...

1142
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:11,261
And you let her go.

1143
01:20:11,261 --> 01:20:12,261
Ishaan!

1144
01:20:13,422 --> 01:20:14,803
Hold this.

1145
01:20:14,843 --> 01:20:16,344
Good morning, uncle.
How are you?

1146
01:20:17,214 --> 01:20:19,806
Congratulations! We are proud of you!

1147
01:20:23,887 --> 01:20:25,138
What's this for, uncle?

1148
01:20:25,138 --> 01:20:27,059
Our prestige is sky high today.

1149
01:20:27,059 --> 01:20:28,600
We're very proud of you.

1150
01:20:28,600 --> 01:20:29,640
Correct, uncle.

1151
01:20:29,640 --> 01:20:31,471
He's India's pride.

1152
01:20:31,471 --> 01:20:34,682
Why India...
He's made all Bengalis proud.

1153
01:20:34,682 --> 01:20:36,894
He has made all Brahmins proud.

1154
01:20:36,894 --> 01:20:39,974
Never have any idea what he's talking about.

1155
01:20:39,974 --> 01:20:41,436
Why what do you want?

1156
01:20:41,436 --> 01:20:44,067
Do you want us to put face masks for you?

1157
01:20:44,067 --> 01:20:44,647
Shut up.

1158
01:20:44,647 --> 01:20:47,479
You shut up.
Get out of here.

1159
01:20:47,479 --> 01:20:49,650
What's wrong with you guys?

1160
01:20:49,820 --> 01:20:50,981
You don't know how respect your elders.

1161
01:20:50,981 --> 01:20:54,361
Uncle, do you want respect or rent?

1162
01:20:54,361 --> 01:20:55,152
What?

1163
01:20:55,613 --> 01:20:56,823
I can't take this, Ishaan.

1164
01:20:56,823 --> 01:20:59,034
Uncle, don't worry about them.

1165
01:20:59,034 --> 01:21:01,576
You've got me lovely flowers.

1166
01:21:01,656 --> 01:21:03,366
And the weather is lovely.

1167
01:21:03,366 --> 01:21:04,697
It's so peaceful here.

1168
01:21:04,697 --> 01:21:06,157
You don't have to talk to them.

1169
01:21:06,788 --> 01:21:09,239
By the way, what did you want to tell me?

1170
01:21:10,370 --> 01:21:11,490
Yeah, I remember.

1171
01:21:11,490 --> 01:21:13,411
Ishaan, give me your mom's phone number.

1172
01:21:13,831 --> 01:21:14,581
Why?

1173
01:21:14,872 --> 01:21:19,413
It's a matter of discussion for the adults.
You kids won't understand.

1174
01:21:19,413 --> 01:21:21,915
- Just give me the number.
- Okay, take it down.

1175
01:21:22,995 --> 01:21:24,246
Ishaan.

1176
01:21:24,996 --> 01:21:26,087
One second.

1177
01:21:26,087 --> 01:21:27,667
Ria is calling you.

1178
01:21:27,707 --> 01:21:30,089
Ria is calling you.
Go, talk to her.

1179
01:21:36,712 --> 01:21:40,214
My father wants to get us married.

1180
01:21:40,214 --> 01:21:41,135
What?

1181
01:21:44,385 --> 01:21:46,007
Don't worry. I'll manage.

1182
01:21:47,057 --> 01:21:49,388
Please, fix my wedding with Rahul.

1183
01:21:50,348 --> 01:21:52,430
Your wedding is my responsibility.

1184
01:21:52,849 --> 01:21:53,760
Thank you.

1185
01:21:55,141 --> 01:21:57,182
Ishaan... Ishaan...

1186
01:21:57,432 --> 01:21:59,063
Is this salt or sugar?

1187
01:22:01,143 --> 01:22:02,765
This is detergent.

1188
01:22:04,685 --> 01:22:08,147
I mixed it in my milk and drank it.

1189
01:22:08,147 --> 01:22:10,148
What will happen now?

1190
01:22:10,148 --> 01:22:11,729
I drank a lot of detergent, bro...

1191
01:22:13,319 --> 01:22:16,071
I will pee bubbles now...

1192
01:22:18,522 --> 01:22:19,232
Hey...

1193
01:22:19,903 --> 01:22:21,573
You look beautiful.

1194
01:22:21,984 --> 01:22:22,905
Thank you.

1195
01:22:24,024 --> 01:22:24,905
What's this?

1196
01:22:25,155 --> 01:22:26,445
Sweets from India.

1197
01:22:26,776 --> 01:22:27,907
All of it for me?

1198
01:22:28,577 --> 01:22:31,078
Please share and eat.

1199
01:22:31,078 --> 01:22:33,619
How about...

1200
01:22:33,619 --> 01:22:35,530
...we have it together at night?

1201
01:22:37,161 --> 01:22:38,121
Hey!

1202
01:22:38,371 --> 01:22:39,532
Mom is online.

1203
01:22:39,913 --> 01:22:41,163
Why did you tell them?

1204
01:22:41,583 --> 01:22:43,244
You could have told them later.

1205
01:22:43,534 --> 01:22:45,165
I was getting some entertainment for free.

1206
01:22:45,165 --> 01:22:47,286
- Hello, aunty.
- Hi, aunty. How are you?

1207
01:22:47,286 --> 01:22:48,167
Hi!

1208
01:22:48,167 --> 01:22:51,377
Aunty, we were just talking.

1209
01:22:51,377 --> 01:22:54,879
It didn't look like you were just talking.

1210
01:22:55,380 --> 01:22:57,040
It's time you got hitched.

1211
01:22:57,040 --> 01:22:59,711
We're depending on Ishaan for that.

1212
01:22:59,711 --> 01:23:03,794
Ishaan, I don't want you to help Rahul at all.

1213
01:23:04,674 --> 01:23:06,215
What are you saying, aunty?

1214
01:23:06,215 --> 01:23:08,796
Friends should help each other.

1215
01:23:08,796 --> 01:23:12,138
You'll get married and your friend will remain single?

1216
01:23:12,138 --> 01:23:13,469
How is that fair?

1217
01:23:13,598 --> 01:23:15,760
Aunty, you don't know anything.

1218
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:21,853
We've tried to set him up with a lot of girls.
He doesn't like anyone.

1219
01:23:21,853 --> 01:23:24,514
The other day, we introduced him
to a very pretty girl.

1220
01:23:24,514 --> 01:23:26,605
He directly told her he is not interested.

1221
01:23:26,605 --> 01:23:27,975
What can you say to that?

1222
01:23:28,305 --> 01:23:30,766
I don't like anyone, Mom...

1223
01:23:31,397 --> 01:23:32,227
Why?

1224
01:23:32,858 --> 01:23:35,689
In our country, people first get married.

1225
01:23:35,689 --> 01:23:37,270
Then they fall in love.

1226
01:23:37,270 --> 01:23:38,401
Hello, aunty.

1227
01:23:39,150 --> 01:23:41,272
Ishaan, don't hang up.

1228
01:23:43,063 --> 01:23:44,193
- What happened?
- Ishaan...

1229
01:23:44,773 --> 01:23:47,114
I have something personal to say
to my mom.

1230
01:23:49,656 --> 01:23:50,906
What was that all about?

1231
01:23:53,567 --> 01:23:55,029
Stop your girlfriend.

1232
01:23:55,239 --> 01:23:57,119
- Stop irritating...
- She is annoying me.

1233
01:23:57,369 --> 01:23:59,991
- Get lost...
- This isn't right.

1234
01:24:00,621 --> 01:24:02,031
Watch it! Watch it! Watch it!.

1235
01:24:02,031 --> 01:24:04,623
- Sorry. -Sorry.
- Sorry.

1236
01:24:08,705 --> 01:24:09,625
Hey.

1237
01:24:10,245 --> 01:24:10,916
Hey.

1238
01:24:12,706 --> 01:24:14,378
Did you consider my offer?

1239
01:24:15,037 --> 01:24:17,499
I'll take the offer only
if my friends are on the team.

1240
01:24:27,924 --> 01:24:30,755
Fine. I'll see you in the office tomorrow.

1241
01:24:39,259 --> 01:24:41,430
Good afternoon.
I'm Bill, Mike's assistant.

1242
01:24:41,430 --> 01:24:43,891
He requested you meet him in the canteen
if you don't mind.

1243
01:24:43,891 --> 01:24:45,012
- If you could come this way.
- Yes, sure.

1244
01:24:45,012 --> 01:24:46,222
- Thank you.
- Let's go.

1245
01:24:50,435 --> 01:24:51,095
Hey.

1246
01:24:51,435 --> 01:24:52,846
Sit down, guys. Sit down.

1247
01:24:56,937 --> 01:25:01,310
The Morgan and Trent Construction is planning
a township across a thousand acres.

1248
01:25:01,310 --> 01:25:05,022
Our company has won the contract
of row houses in New Hamilton.

1249
01:25:05,022 --> 01:25:08,693
We'd like you to design
the best row house model.

1250
01:25:08,693 --> 01:25:10,314
Don't worry, we'll get it done.

1251
01:25:10,605 --> 01:25:11,484
Good luck!

1252
01:25:12,275 --> 01:25:14,856
I'm not worried about the design at all.

1253
01:25:15,197 --> 01:25:17,357
Because I know you are the best.

1254
01:25:17,487 --> 01:25:18,949
What about our job security?

1255
01:25:19,029 --> 01:25:20,529
We have to be a little smart.

1256
01:25:20,659 --> 01:25:21,740
What do you mean?

1257
01:25:21,740 --> 01:25:25,321
We should have a good relationship
with the site manager. That's it.

1258
01:25:25,321 --> 01:25:26,612
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1259
01:25:26,612 --> 01:25:29,493
I can't get into all this.
It's up to you guys.

1260
01:25:30,284 --> 01:25:31,244
Okay.

1261
01:25:37,417 --> 01:25:38,118
Hello.

1262
01:25:38,118 --> 01:25:39,618
When are you getting here?

1263
01:25:39,618 --> 01:25:41,749
We can't come today.

1264
01:25:42,459 --> 01:25:43,670
Why? What's wrong?

1265
01:25:43,670 --> 01:25:46,372
Ria and I are working on something else.

1266
01:25:46,372 --> 01:25:48,713
Okay. Hang up.
Bloody excuses.

1267
01:25:52,674 --> 01:25:53,875
What's up, Raju?

1268
01:25:54,926 --> 01:25:58,337
I've bet a lot of money
on this India-Pakistan match.

1269
01:25:59,047 --> 01:26:01,969
Virat's performance is dependent on his wife...

1270
01:26:03,010 --> 01:26:05,841
You can bet on replay of matches too?

1271
01:26:06,841 --> 01:26:08,222
Replay match?

1272
01:26:08,722 --> 01:26:12,974
Just because of stupid fools like you
we were ruled by the Brits for 200 years.

1273
01:26:17,346 --> 01:26:18,937
- Hi!
- How are you doing?

1274
01:26:19,227 --> 01:26:21,308
- This way?
- Yeah, yeah...

1275
01:26:21,638 --> 01:26:23,099
Hi, good to see you.

1276
01:26:23,389 --> 01:26:27,311
A challenging project
in London's top architectural firm...

1277
01:26:27,311 --> 01:26:29,021
...was waiting for me.

1278
01:26:29,021 --> 01:26:30,893
Exactly the way I wanted.

1279
01:26:30,893 --> 01:26:33,104
Life is perfect.

1280
01:26:37,066 --> 01:26:38,446
Hey, Ishaan.

1281
01:26:38,446 --> 01:26:40,947
Let me introduce you to the site manager.

1282
01:26:58,786 --> 01:27:00,246
Ishaan?

1283
01:27:47,979 --> 01:27:49,930
Hey... You're back.

1284
01:27:50,931 --> 01:27:53,522
Is the site manager so ugly?

1285
01:27:55,563 --> 01:27:57,144
Did you know from before?

1286
01:27:57,774 --> 01:28:00,486
Of course, I knew...
I made it happen.

1287
01:28:04,397 --> 01:28:09,280
I knew you would get mad at me.
That's why I didn't say anything.

1288
01:28:09,360 --> 01:28:14,072
You're single. She's single.
It'll be great for everyone if you mingle.

1289
01:28:14,242 --> 01:28:17,324
Why have you taken the bat out?
Do you want to play cricket now?

1290
01:28:17,324 --> 01:28:18,614
Shut up.

1291
01:28:18,614 --> 01:28:19,535
Where's the ball?

1292
01:28:19,535 --> 01:28:21,866
Why? We have you.

1293
01:28:21,866 --> 01:28:22,906
Pardon.

1294
01:28:25,538 --> 01:28:26,497
That hurt.

1295
01:28:26,497 --> 01:28:29,369
No good deed goes unpunished...
Ishaan, you're hurting me.

1296
01:28:29,449 --> 01:28:31,200
What are you doing, Ishaan?

1297
01:28:31,200 --> 01:28:32,791
Please let him go...
You might injure him.

1298
01:28:32,791 --> 01:28:35,162
I'll tell you everything.
Please let him go.

1299
01:28:38,503 --> 01:28:41,835
Kill them both.
Scoundrels!

1300
01:28:42,586 --> 01:28:45,627
- Uncle is saying something...
- I'll tell you what he is saying...

1301
01:28:45,627 --> 01:28:47,548
Where will you run to?

1302
01:28:48,259 --> 01:28:51,210
- That is hurting me...
- Ishaan... Stop.

1303
01:28:51,210 --> 01:28:53,261
Ishaan, what's going on?

1304
01:28:53,261 --> 01:28:53,921
What happened?

1305
01:28:53,921 --> 01:28:55,462
I was just trying to help him.

1306
01:28:55,462 --> 01:28:56,962
Please tell me what's wrong?

1307
01:28:56,962 --> 01:28:58,463
Ria, where's my room?

1308
01:29:04,766 --> 01:29:05,966
Khushi?

1309
01:29:06,057 --> 01:29:08,097
What are you doing here, brother?

1310
01:29:12,770 --> 01:29:15,561
Did you know from before
that she's our site manager?

1311
01:29:16,222 --> 01:29:18,393
I swear, I didn't know.

1312
01:29:18,523 --> 01:29:21,184
I knew that the site manager
is a woman but...

1313
01:29:21,184 --> 01:29:24,226
I didn't know that the site manager is Khushi.

1314
01:29:24,226 --> 01:29:25,396
God promise.

1315
01:29:25,396 --> 01:29:26,357
Wait. Wait. Wait.

1316
01:29:26,567 --> 01:29:28,187
You all know each other from before.

1317
01:29:28,187 --> 01:29:29,648
Shut up.

1318
01:29:30,568 --> 01:29:32,980
She is Khushi from Kolkata.

1319
01:29:34,570 --> 01:29:35,231
What?

1320
01:29:36,031 --> 01:29:37,232
What is she doing here?

1321
01:29:38,152 --> 01:29:42,784
I thought if the site manager lives here
as a paying guest then...

1322
01:29:42,784 --> 01:29:43,825
Then what?

1323
01:29:44,785 --> 01:29:46,737
Our jobs will be secure.

1324
01:29:47,116 --> 01:29:48,367
Really?

1325
01:29:49,077 --> 01:29:50,698
It was his idea.

1326
01:29:56,581 --> 01:29:58,621
She will not stay here.

1327
01:29:59,452 --> 01:30:00,243
Ishaan...

1328
01:30:00,243 --> 01:30:01,623
What is this, Ria?

1329
01:30:01,623 --> 01:30:03,835
I had already checked in to the hotel.

1330
01:30:03,835 --> 01:30:05,665
You forced me to come here.

1331
01:30:05,665 --> 01:30:07,246
What is all this?

1332
01:30:07,246 --> 01:30:08,837
What is this nuissance?

1333
01:30:09,127 --> 01:30:09,707
Khushi...

1334
01:30:09,707 --> 01:30:10,668
Ria, I'm warning you.

1335
01:30:10,668 --> 01:30:12,338
If she stays here then...

1336
01:30:12,958 --> 01:30:13,799
Then what?

1337
01:30:14,460 --> 01:30:17,381
Then, I'll tell your father
that I'm ready to marry you.

1338
01:30:18,501 --> 01:30:20,593
- Ishaan...
- Just wait a minute...

1339
01:30:20,593 --> 01:30:25,055
Ishaan, you had promised
that you would get us married.

1340
01:30:25,055 --> 01:30:26,965
How can you go back on your word now?

1341
01:30:27,305 --> 01:30:29,847
I wanted to make her your sister-in-law.

1342
01:30:29,847 --> 01:30:32,057
And you're trying to make her
my sister-in-law.

1343
01:30:32,057 --> 01:30:35,810
You've finally realised your place in the world.

1344
01:30:37,261 --> 01:30:38,181
Who is she?

1345
01:30:38,931 --> 01:30:41,392
Dad, this is Khushi.
I told you about her.

1346
01:30:41,392 --> 01:30:42,473
Hello, uncle.

1347
01:30:42,473 --> 01:30:44,514
Hello... Where are you from?

1348
01:30:44,514 --> 01:30:45,565
Kolkata.

1349
01:30:46,144 --> 01:30:47,816
- Are you Brahmin?
- Yes.

1350
01:30:47,976 --> 01:30:50,066
What's your surname?

1351
01:30:50,066 --> 01:30:51,107
Mukherjee.

1352
01:30:51,147 --> 01:30:52,267
Really?

1353
01:30:56,820 --> 01:31:01,272
Do you know who owns the house
next to yours?

1354
01:31:01,402 --> 01:31:02,193
Who, uncle?

1355
01:31:02,193 --> 01:31:05,573
- It belongs to us!
- Really?

1356
01:31:06,194 --> 01:31:11,737
She is Brahmin. She's a distant relative.

1357
01:31:11,947 --> 01:31:13,368
She belongs to your community.

1358
01:31:15,198 --> 01:31:17,369
I'm sure you're feeling tired.

1359
01:31:17,579 --> 01:31:22,532
Let's go in. You can freshen up
and grab a bite.

1360
01:31:22,532 --> 01:31:24,784
- Okay, uncle.
- Come with me.

1361
01:31:28,084 --> 01:31:29,125
I'll do it.

1362
01:31:29,375 --> 01:31:30,376
Are you sure?

1363
01:31:30,495 --> 01:31:32,537
- No problem at all.
- Otherwise, I can do it too.

1364
01:31:42,962 --> 01:31:45,253
That looks raw...

1365
01:31:45,593 --> 01:31:47,463
Dad, Khushi...

1366
01:31:47,463 --> 01:31:52,507
I knew it, Khushi!
I knew you would make something for me.

1367
01:31:52,507 --> 01:31:53,927
I baked a chocolate cake.

1368
01:31:53,927 --> 01:31:56,468
- Wow! This looks delicious!
- Thank you.

1369
01:31:56,468 --> 01:31:58,300
Let me try.

1370
01:32:02,641 --> 01:32:06,143
Bengalis are the best cooks.

1371
01:32:06,393 --> 01:32:08,684
Ishaan, just try it.

1372
01:32:08,684 --> 01:32:13,106
What a super cake!

1373
01:32:13,646 --> 01:32:16,107
You must try it.

1374
01:32:16,107 --> 01:32:17,769
Just a bite...

1375
01:32:17,769 --> 01:32:21,940
No uncle... I don't like chocolates...

1376
01:32:22,150 --> 01:32:23,651
Excuse me.

1377
01:32:35,367 --> 01:32:36,698
Ishaan, wait.

1378
01:32:37,737 --> 01:32:40,489
Ishaan, I need to talk to you.
Please stop.

1379
01:32:40,489 --> 01:32:42,120
Ishaan, listen to me please...

1380
01:32:42,120 --> 01:32:43,781
Please, listen to me...

1381
01:32:44,071 --> 01:32:45,991
I'm sorry... Sorry...

1382
01:32:46,071 --> 01:32:47,913
Hey, watch it.

1383
01:32:48,493 --> 01:32:49,453
Sorry, ma'am.

1384
01:32:52,375 --> 01:32:55,036
Ishaan! Ishaan!

1385
01:32:56,327 --> 01:32:57,417
Ishaan!

1386
01:32:59,958 --> 01:33:02,170
We had a fight a long time ago...

1387
01:33:02,170 --> 01:33:03,880
We broke up. It's over.

1388
01:33:04,131 --> 01:33:05,921
This is very awkward for me too.

1389
01:33:05,921 --> 01:33:08,542
But people remain friends
even after they break up.

1390
01:33:08,542 --> 01:33:10,174
Can't we?

1391
01:33:20,178 --> 01:33:22,339
I don't like two things in life.

1392
01:33:23,260 --> 01:33:26,551
One is chocolate.
And the other is you.

1393
01:33:27,512 --> 01:33:29,263
Friendship, my foot.

1394
01:33:29,263 --> 01:33:31,183
Mind your own business.

1395
01:33:31,724 --> 01:33:33,474
You have no option, Ishaan.

1396
01:33:33,474 --> 01:33:36,846
You can behave in any way you want
in front of your friends.

1397
01:33:36,846 --> 01:33:38,227
What about in office?

1398
01:33:38,227 --> 01:33:40,098
Remember that I'm your superior.

1399
01:33:40,098 --> 01:33:41,399
What will you do there?

1400
01:33:41,399 --> 01:33:43,650
You have to report to me.

1401
01:33:58,816 --> 01:33:59,817
What is this?

1402
01:33:59,817 --> 01:34:00,948
My resignation letter.

1403
01:34:00,948 --> 01:34:02,699
What? Why?

1404
01:34:02,699 --> 01:34:04,609
I can't work under you.

1405
01:34:06,070 --> 01:34:08,161
You still haven't changed a bit, Ishaan.

1406
01:34:08,361 --> 01:34:11,203
You still take decisions,
impulsively and out of anger.

1407
01:34:12,613 --> 01:34:15,284
I can't be calculative like you.

1408
01:34:15,284 --> 01:34:16,575
What to do?

1409
01:34:17,456 --> 01:34:18,536
Fine.

1410
01:34:19,416 --> 01:34:21,327
I'll accept your resignation.

1411
01:34:21,327 --> 01:34:22,788
But what about your friends?

1412
01:34:23,039 --> 01:34:24,919
They'll do whatever I tell them to do.

1413
01:34:26,210 --> 01:34:28,421
Pack up your stuff.

1414
01:34:30,171 --> 01:34:32,082
Just hold on for a minute.

1415
01:34:32,082 --> 01:34:35,174
Let's just discuss this once
and then figure things out.

1416
01:34:35,964 --> 01:34:36,965
Please...

1417
01:34:46,219 --> 01:34:48,471
Ishaan, let's not rush into a decision.

1418
01:34:49,180 --> 01:34:51,721
Your sudden decisions affect us...

1419
01:34:51,721 --> 01:34:53,343
It'll leave us jobless.

1420
01:34:53,343 --> 01:34:56,014
It's true... He is right.

1421
01:34:56,805 --> 01:34:58,765
Why is she objecting now?

1422
01:34:59,306 --> 01:35:03,477
She is right. Finding a job
in this market is impossible.

1423
01:35:03,477 --> 01:35:04,388
Yeah...

1424
01:35:04,558 --> 01:35:06,439
My dad doesn't like him.

1425
01:35:06,439 --> 01:35:11,441
He'll throw me out of the house if I tell him,
Rahul is jobless and I want to marry him.

1426
01:35:11,441 --> 01:35:13,693
But I can't work under Khushi.

1427
01:35:13,693 --> 01:35:15,273
Why under?

1428
01:35:16,024 --> 01:35:17,354
Who said that?

1429
01:35:17,354 --> 01:35:18,195
I mean...

1430
01:35:18,195 --> 01:35:20,105
You're high above.
She's down below.

1431
01:35:20,105 --> 01:35:22,027
She's on the second floor.
And we are on the third floor.

1432
01:35:22,027 --> 01:35:24,778
Technically, she is under you.

1433
01:35:25,238 --> 01:35:26,529
I'm still not convinced.

1434
01:35:26,529 --> 01:35:27,609
But why?

1435
01:35:27,609 --> 01:35:30,820
If you're not convinced,
we'll be jobless, Ishaan.

1436
01:35:30,820 --> 01:35:35,203
If we didn't like the invigilator,
did we stop writing the exam?

1437
01:35:35,203 --> 01:35:39,705
Does the batsman stop playing
if he doesn't like the umpire?

1438
01:35:39,865 --> 01:35:42,076
It's the same here.

1439
01:35:42,076 --> 01:35:44,617
- Please... - Please...
- Please...

1440
01:35:47,408 --> 01:35:49,750
Alright... But...

1441
01:35:50,830 --> 01:35:52,541
I'm not going to talk to her.

1442
01:35:52,541 --> 01:35:53,251
No, no, no...

1443
01:35:53,541 --> 01:35:54,872
Fine...

1444
01:35:54,872 --> 01:35:56,413
You don't have to say anything.

1445
01:35:56,413 --> 01:35:57,754
I'll speak to her.

1446
01:35:58,254 --> 01:36:00,215
We just need your permission.

1447
01:36:02,626 --> 01:36:03,547
Okay.

1448
01:36:05,547 --> 01:36:07,378
Madam...

1449
01:36:07,378 --> 01:36:10,589
We want to withdraw Ishaan's resignation.

1450
01:36:10,589 --> 01:36:11,670
- Really?
- Yes...

1451
01:36:11,971 --> 01:36:12,970
Why?

1452
01:36:13,341 --> 01:36:20,224
We've convinced him with a lot of difficulty.

1453
01:36:20,224 --> 01:36:21,595
Will he work sincerely?

1454
01:36:21,595 --> 01:36:23,176
Of course... Guaranteed.

1455
01:36:23,176 --> 01:36:26,057
He is very, very, very...

1456
01:36:26,307 --> 01:36:27,518
...talented, madam.

1457
01:36:28,558 --> 01:36:30,099
And what about his attitude?

1458
01:36:30,099 --> 01:36:31,850
How much longer?

1459
01:36:32,930 --> 01:36:33,981
Oh, God!

1460
01:36:33,981 --> 01:36:35,892
Why are you requesting her like this?

1461
01:36:36,312 --> 01:36:37,682
Who is requesting?

1462
01:36:37,682 --> 01:36:39,524
Please save us, madam.

1463
01:36:40,523 --> 01:36:42,485
If you don't withdraw your resignation letter...

1464
01:36:42,485 --> 01:36:44,816
We'll be ruined, madam...

1465
01:36:45,487 --> 01:36:48,108
You're so talented you don't get these things.

1466
01:36:48,528 --> 01:36:52,149
Please, don't say no.

1467
01:36:52,149 --> 01:36:54,941
How will I explain to her?

1468
01:36:54,941 --> 01:36:58,032
Please try to understand our situation.

1469
01:36:58,072 --> 01:37:01,034
If you don't withdraw
your resignation letter after this...

1470
01:37:01,404 --> 01:37:05,116
Madam, I'll commit suicide.

1471
01:37:08,697 --> 01:37:10,328
Alright.

1472
01:37:10,869 --> 01:37:13,749
I'll withdraw it because you are begging me to...

1473
01:37:17,581 --> 01:37:19,952
Thank you... Thank you so much...

1474
01:37:24,205 --> 01:37:27,337
Hey, aren't you going to thank me?

1475
01:37:27,417 --> 01:37:29,587
I saved our jobs.

1476
01:37:29,958 --> 01:37:31,628
Follow me.

1477
01:37:39,762 --> 01:37:43,424
Good. You are at least concerned
about your friends.

1478
01:37:44,594 --> 01:37:46,095
What else can I do?

1479
01:37:46,345 --> 01:37:49,097
I can't be selfish like you.

1480
01:37:49,137 --> 01:37:52,809
Maybe, that's the difference
between you and me.

1481
01:38:02,393 --> 01:38:05,184
Ishaan, you and Raju take this one.

1482
01:38:05,394 --> 01:38:06,605
Ria and I will take this one.

1483
01:38:06,776 --> 01:38:09,147
And madam can take that one.
Does that work?

1484
01:38:09,147 --> 01:38:10,026
Nope.

1485
01:38:10,857 --> 01:38:12,068
I want that one.

1486
01:38:12,068 --> 01:38:13,148
You two can take that one.

1487
01:38:13,148 --> 01:38:14,689
Ria can take this one and...

1488
01:38:15,069 --> 01:38:16,690
I don't care where madam will stay.

1489
01:38:32,617 --> 01:38:34,329
So, this is the site.

1490
01:38:35,909 --> 01:38:38,740
You can't enter without the safety jackets.

1491
01:38:42,412 --> 01:38:44,623
You can't work without the helmets.

1492
01:38:47,585 --> 01:38:51,626
And no one can leave the site premises
without my permission.

1493
01:38:51,916 --> 01:38:52,997
Understood?

1494
01:38:53,297 --> 01:38:56,960
That's what you get for bringing
software engineers to a construction site.

1495
01:40:03,621 --> 01:40:04,491
Wow!

1496
01:40:05,992 --> 01:40:08,834
- Hey, Khushi, happy birthday!
- Thank you.

1497
01:40:09,584 --> 01:40:11,915
Ishaan, did you wish her?

1498
01:40:12,875 --> 01:40:14,036
No.

1499
01:40:14,837 --> 01:40:16,997
It's okay. He must have forgotten.

1500
01:40:18,037 --> 01:40:19,338
What's there to remember?

1501
01:40:19,919 --> 01:40:21,920
It's not like it's Gandhi's birthday.

1502
01:40:23,750 --> 01:40:24,881
Woah!

1503
01:40:25,922 --> 01:40:28,093
What a beautiful day!

1504
01:40:29,003 --> 01:40:30,924
Khushi, happy birthday!

1505
01:40:30,924 --> 01:40:32,004
Thank you.

1506
01:40:32,384 --> 01:40:35,846
Not bad, Rahul.
You remembered her birthday?

1507
01:40:35,846 --> 01:40:38,678
I hardly ever remember your birthday...
How can I remember hers?

1508
01:40:39,548 --> 01:40:40,388
Then?

1509
01:40:40,508 --> 01:40:42,179
Ishaan told me last night.

1510
01:40:46,851 --> 01:40:47,892
What?

1511
01:40:49,222 --> 01:40:50,513
I swear.

1512
01:40:50,513 --> 01:40:53,105
Didn't you tell me last night?

1513
01:40:59,268 --> 01:41:01,018
Happy birthday, madam!

1514
01:41:01,018 --> 01:41:07,482
Happy birthday to you!
Happy birthday to you!

1515
01:41:07,482 --> 01:41:10,523
- Happy birthday!
- Thank you, Raju.

1516
01:41:10,523 --> 01:41:14,274
Did you like the birthday song?

1517
01:41:14,525 --> 01:41:16,735
Who told you it's my birthday?

1518
01:41:16,735 --> 01:41:18,447
- Rahul?
- No...

1519
01:41:20,067 --> 01:41:21,528
Ishaan told me.

1520
01:41:22,568 --> 01:41:24,820
Don't say it...
Shut up! Shut up!

1521
01:41:27,031 --> 01:41:28,121
Facebook.

1522
01:41:28,621 --> 01:41:30,203
I don't have any account on Facebook.

1523
01:41:33,204 --> 01:41:34,995
Twitter?

1524
01:41:35,035 --> 01:41:36,575
What have you done, madam?

1525
01:41:36,575 --> 01:41:38,877
Even the biggest celebrities
have Twitter accounts.

1526
01:41:38,877 --> 01:41:40,707
You could have made an account to follow them.

1527
01:41:41,827 --> 01:41:43,289
Ishaan looks really angry.

1528
01:41:44,079 --> 01:41:45,289
Spitting fire through his eyes.

1529
01:41:45,289 --> 01:41:47,630
I can feel my back burning...

1530
01:41:47,920 --> 01:41:49,792
Oh no...

1531
01:41:59,466 --> 01:42:00,587
Memory.

1532
01:42:02,047 --> 01:42:03,969
Good or bad.

1533
01:42:05,839 --> 01:42:08,010
They stay with us all our lives.

1534
01:42:10,091 --> 01:42:11,892
It's a baggage we carry around.

1535
01:42:23,767 --> 01:42:24,768
Ishaan...

1536
01:42:27,099 --> 01:42:28,400
Where are you going with all your stuff?

1537
01:42:28,400 --> 01:42:30,901
It's a long weekend so...

1538
01:42:31,232 --> 01:42:34,233
We thought we'll make a quick trip home.

1539
01:42:34,233 --> 01:42:38,695
And Dad called.
He said he had some work.

1540
01:42:38,695 --> 01:42:39,986
What about you?

1541
01:42:40,355 --> 01:42:43,197
It's Khushi's birthday...
She's throwing a party.

1542
01:42:43,607 --> 01:42:47,239
If you say no, I won't go.

1543
01:42:47,529 --> 01:42:48,909
Fine, go ahead.

1544
01:42:53,452 --> 01:42:54,612
Ishaan...

1545
01:42:54,702 --> 01:42:57,243
It's a long weekend...

1546
01:42:57,704 --> 01:42:59,826
You can come with us...

1547
01:42:59,826 --> 01:43:02,036
We could have some good time together.

1548
01:43:02,036 --> 01:43:03,707
I can't... I have work.

1549
01:43:07,169 --> 01:43:09,329
Hey, useless fellow!

1550
01:43:09,830 --> 01:43:11,961
Why do come to work
when you don't know anything?

1551
01:43:12,541 --> 01:43:14,422
Ishaan, he doesn't understand Bengali.

1552
01:43:14,422 --> 01:43:16,003
But we do.

1553
01:43:16,003 --> 01:43:18,084
He was talking to us...

1554
01:43:18,464 --> 01:43:19,375
Let's go.

1555
01:43:24,928 --> 01:43:27,379
- Shall we leave?
- Yup.

1556
01:43:29,880 --> 01:43:31,590
Is he not coming with us?

1557
01:43:31,970 --> 01:43:34,341
He said he has some work.

1558
01:43:34,762 --> 01:43:38,474
Then, I'll stay back too.

1559
01:43:38,934 --> 01:43:40,765
But your birthday party?

1560
01:43:41,475 --> 01:43:45,347
If there's work to be done...
Then as the site manager, I have to stay.

1561
01:43:46,598 --> 01:43:48,849
Okay, let's go.

1562
01:43:49,479 --> 01:43:50,689
- Bye.
- Bye.

1563
01:43:50,979 --> 01:43:51,890
Bye.

1564
01:44:16,992 --> 01:44:18,072
Ishaan?

1565
01:44:24,615 --> 01:44:25,706
Ishaan, wait...

1566
01:44:32,369 --> 01:44:34,160
Ishaan, will you drop me home?

1567
01:44:47,166 --> 01:44:49,297
This is the number for a local cab service.

1568
01:44:50,468 --> 01:44:52,048
Call them and book a cab.

1569
01:45:02,594 --> 01:45:06,555
Hey, hey, hey, pretty lady...
Stop here.

1570
01:45:08,516 --> 01:45:11,558
Hey, pretty lady...

1571
01:45:11,558 --> 01:45:12,729
Help!

1572
01:45:12,729 --> 01:45:13,979
Come here...

1573
01:45:14,679 --> 01:45:15,930
Help!

1574
01:45:17,431 --> 01:45:19,681
Please, someone help me...

1575
01:45:19,892 --> 01:45:21,893
- Pretty lady, come with us...
- Let me go.

1576
01:45:21,893 --> 01:45:22,893
Leave me alone.

1577
01:45:23,233 --> 01:45:24,605
Please let me go.

1578
01:45:24,605 --> 01:45:28,105
Come here, come give me a kiss.
Let's go... Come with us.

1579
01:45:28,105 --> 01:45:29,647
Please let me go.

1580
01:45:42,993 --> 01:45:46,034
Hey, get your car out of the way.

1581
01:45:48,996 --> 01:45:50,656
What's your problem, mate?

1582
01:45:59,661 --> 01:46:03,583
Are you looking for a fight?

1583
01:46:04,543 --> 01:46:06,755
Do you want to fight with me, mate?

1584
01:46:07,374 --> 01:46:09,376
Told you to move your car, didn't I?

1585
01:46:25,764 --> 01:46:27,214
You ruined my Armani.

1586
01:46:27,214 --> 01:46:28,555
What?

1587
01:47:28,293 --> 01:47:29,744
Ishaan, stop.

1588
01:47:31,084 --> 01:47:32,746
Ishaan, let him go.

1589
01:47:33,836 --> 01:47:34,876
Stop it!

1590
01:47:34,876 --> 01:47:36,667
You'll beat him to death.

1591
01:47:40,209 --> 01:47:41,420
Stop it!

1592
01:47:46,923 --> 01:47:48,343
Hands up! Stay where you are.

1593
01:47:48,343 --> 01:47:49,594
Please don't move.

1594
01:47:49,594 --> 01:47:51,885
What's going on?

1595
01:47:53,215 --> 01:47:55,557
Don't move. Don't move.

1596
01:47:55,926 --> 01:47:57,057
Stay here.

1597
01:47:57,137 --> 01:47:58,508
Officer, he's innocent.

1598
01:47:58,508 --> 01:48:01,719
She's lying, officer.

1599
01:48:01,929 --> 01:48:05,261
He's lying. They're misbehaving with me
and he saved me from them.

1600
01:48:05,261 --> 01:48:07,812
I beat them up because he tore my button.

1601
01:48:07,812 --> 01:48:09,763
Shut up or you'll go to jail.

1602
01:48:09,763 --> 01:48:10,934
Do you know this guy?

1603
01:48:10,934 --> 01:48:13,144
Yes, sir. He is my boyfriend.

1604
01:48:13,645 --> 01:48:15,186
Stay right here.

1605
01:48:16,817 --> 01:48:19,478
Don't move.
Sorry for any confusion.

1606
01:48:20,859 --> 01:48:24,610
- On your knees... get down!
- What are you saying?

1607
01:48:24,610 --> 01:48:28,823
Ishaan, I didn't know what else to call you
so I called you my boyfriend.

1608
01:48:28,823 --> 01:48:30,573
I'm sorry...

1609
01:48:35,485 --> 01:48:38,827
I don't know what would have happened
if you weren't here today...

1610
01:48:38,827 --> 01:48:40,778
At least, my button would have been intact.

1611
01:48:41,578 --> 01:48:42,659
What?

1612
01:48:42,909 --> 01:48:44,370
Get in the car.

1613
01:48:50,873 --> 01:48:53,084
Ishaan, can I say something?

1614
01:48:55,535 --> 01:49:00,167
I had tried to put myself in your place
and thought a lot about our fight.

1615
01:49:01,788 --> 01:49:03,839
It was my fault.

1616
01:49:05,709 --> 01:49:07,291
I'm really sorry.

1617
01:49:08,881 --> 01:49:12,673
But have you ever thought about it
from my point of view.

1618
01:49:14,884 --> 01:49:15,715
No.

1619
01:49:16,925 --> 01:49:18,756
You said it's your fault.

1620
01:49:19,177 --> 01:49:22,258
There's nothing for me to reconsider.

1621
01:49:36,514 --> 01:49:41,937
How dare you? Living under my roof
and fooling around with my daughter....

1622
01:49:43,228 --> 01:49:47,020
Please hear me out...

1623
01:49:47,020 --> 01:49:49,311
Shut up... Not another word.

1624
01:49:49,311 --> 01:49:51,482
Uncle, that's enough.

1625
01:49:51,482 --> 01:49:52,983
Don't talk to me.

1626
01:49:52,983 --> 01:49:55,564
Do you know?
Do you have any idea what he has done?

1627
01:49:58,115 --> 01:49:59,235
Yes, I know.

1628
01:50:00,486 --> 01:50:01,616
Dad...

1629
01:50:02,987 --> 01:50:03,818
Mom knows too.

1630
01:50:04,068 --> 01:50:05,158
What?

1631
01:50:05,819 --> 01:50:08,070
You too?
Oh God!

1632
01:50:11,071 --> 01:50:14,203
So, all of you have made a fool of me.

1633
01:50:15,123 --> 01:50:17,164
Uncle, it not like that.

1634
01:50:17,324 --> 01:50:19,455
Rahul loves Ria a lot.

1635
01:50:19,455 --> 01:50:21,376
Love is not enough.

1636
01:50:21,376 --> 01:50:23,997
How can we marry Ria to him?

1637
01:50:23,997 --> 01:50:26,379
He doesn't deserve Ria.

1638
01:50:26,379 --> 01:50:27,709
Why, uncle?

1639
01:50:27,709 --> 01:50:30,250
He has good education. He has a great job.

1640
01:50:30,250 --> 01:50:31,631
He will take care of your daughter.

1641
01:50:31,631 --> 01:50:32,541
What else do you want?

1642
01:50:32,541 --> 01:50:34,633
He's not even from our caste.

1643
01:50:34,633 --> 01:50:37,214
We are upper caste, Brahmins.

1644
01:50:37,214 --> 01:50:39,965
And he is a lower caste, Kayashta.

1645
01:50:39,965 --> 01:50:42,006
There can never be a match.

1646
01:50:42,006 --> 01:50:43,796
Uncle, this is 2018.

1647
01:50:43,796 --> 01:50:45,548
These things don't matter anymore.

1648
01:50:45,548 --> 01:50:47,298
But it matters to me.

1649
01:50:47,298 --> 01:50:49,930
Because I was born in 1961.

1650
01:50:49,930 --> 01:50:51,720
And I believe in it.

1651
01:50:51,720 --> 01:50:54,012
My thought process is the same.

1652
01:50:54,342 --> 01:50:58,844
When the whites discriminate against us,
we call it racism.

1653
01:51:00,304 --> 01:51:03,516
We all huddle together and become Indians.

1654
01:51:04,267 --> 01:51:07,768
And those same Indians create trouble
when it comes to caste.

1655
01:51:07,939 --> 01:51:10,099
He is lower caste...
She is higher caste...

1656
01:51:10,099 --> 01:51:12,230
Why this hypocrisy, uncle?

1657
01:51:12,480 --> 01:51:14,941
Okay, please tell me something.

1658
01:51:15,652 --> 01:51:17,903
Which God do you believe in?

1659
01:51:18,063 --> 01:51:19,274
Lord Krishna.

1660
01:51:19,274 --> 01:51:20,984
Was he Brahmin?

1661
01:51:20,984 --> 01:51:23,816
God doesn't belong to any caste...

1662
01:51:23,816 --> 01:51:28,027
If God doesn't belong to any caste,
then why are we fighting over it?

1663
01:51:42,244 --> 01:51:44,496
Just look at them once.

1664
01:51:44,785 --> 01:51:47,247
They look beautiful together.

1665
01:51:47,537 --> 01:51:49,288
Please say yes, uncle...

1666
01:51:50,079 --> 01:51:52,830
You'll see they'll have
a very happy married life together.

1667
01:51:53,330 --> 01:51:55,421
And what if they don't?

1668
01:51:55,421 --> 01:51:57,872
What if they break up like you two?

1669
01:51:57,872 --> 01:51:59,333
What then?

1670
01:52:06,376 --> 01:52:10,218
I heard you two used to be in a relationship.

1671
01:52:10,218 --> 01:52:14,010
And now you don't even look at each other.

1672
01:52:16,091 --> 01:52:19,012
What if the same thing happens to them?

1673
01:52:20,303 --> 01:52:24,184
When a relationship breaks up,
two people are hurt.

1674
01:52:24,805 --> 01:52:27,476
And when a marriage falls apart,
two families are hurt.

1675
01:52:27,686 --> 01:52:31,889
You are hurting them now thinking about
what might happen in the future.

1676
01:52:32,099 --> 01:52:33,349
What will you do?

1677
01:52:33,389 --> 01:52:35,640
You'll throw Rahul out of the house.

1678
01:52:35,730 --> 01:52:39,102
Then, you'll marry Ria off to someone you like.

1679
01:52:39,102 --> 01:52:42,604
If that guy is good,
she'll be very happy.

1680
01:52:42,604 --> 01:52:45,025
She might even forget Rahul after some time.

1681
01:52:45,025 --> 01:52:49,236
But she'll never be able to forgive you.

1682
01:52:52,238 --> 01:52:56,490
She'll always carry the hurt
in her broken heart all her life.

1683
01:52:56,570 --> 01:53:00,452
She won't remember everything
you've given her.

1684
01:53:00,452 --> 01:53:03,783
But she'll remember the one thing
you've taken away from her.

1685
01:53:04,784 --> 01:53:07,075
We're human beings after all.

1686
01:53:07,075 --> 01:53:09,286
We don't remember the love.

1687
01:53:09,286 --> 01:53:13,158
We only remember the mistakes.

1688
01:53:17,710 --> 01:53:19,911
You won't be able to live with that.

1689
01:53:19,911 --> 01:53:23,793
I don't want to see you in a situation like that.

1690
01:54:06,934 --> 01:54:08,274
Ishaan!

1691
01:54:15,398 --> 01:54:18,029
- Thanks.
- Thank you so much.

1692
01:54:18,439 --> 01:54:20,240
Dad has agreed to our wedding.

1693
01:54:20,240 --> 01:54:23,282
- Wow! Congratulations!
- Thank you!

1694
01:54:23,612 --> 01:54:26,243
It's all because of you two.

1695
01:54:26,243 --> 01:54:28,074
So, when is the big day?

1696
01:54:28,114 --> 01:54:29,245
Next month.

1697
01:54:29,654 --> 01:54:30,905
What's the rush?

1698
01:54:32,076 --> 01:54:34,828
Her dad wanted it.
So, why not?

1699
01:54:35,117 --> 01:54:39,159
Listen, you'll have to help us
arrange the wedding, okay?

1700
01:54:41,910 --> 01:54:42,831
Us?

1701
01:54:42,831 --> 01:54:46,793
I understand it's a little difficult
for you guys but...

1702
01:54:46,793 --> 01:54:49,584
We don't have anybody else.

1703
01:54:51,165 --> 01:54:54,417
Don't worry.
We'll take all the responsibilities.

1704
01:54:55,547 --> 01:54:56,758
Thank you so much.

1705
01:54:56,758 --> 01:54:59,089
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

1706
01:54:59,089 --> 01:54:59,960
Rahul!

1707
01:55:00,129 --> 01:55:02,050
Rahul, your father-in-law is calling you.

1708
01:55:02,050 --> 01:55:04,211
They've fixed a date.

1709
01:55:08,384 --> 01:55:11,175
As you can see,
things are changing really fast.

1710
01:55:11,175 --> 01:55:13,766
- Bye, Khushi.
- Bye.

1711
01:55:26,472 --> 01:55:27,813
Khushi.

1712
01:55:37,397 --> 01:55:39,108
Thanks for everything.

1713
01:55:40,689 --> 01:55:42,279
And...

1714
01:55:45,030 --> 01:55:46,942
Happy birthday!

1715
01:55:47,651 --> 01:55:49,073
Thank you.

1716
01:56:31,553 --> 01:56:40,637
A long time ago, I had given you my secrets

1717
01:56:40,807 --> 01:56:50,012
Let's come together to mend our broken hearts

1718
01:56:50,012 --> 01:56:59,106
A long time ago, I had given you my secrets

1719
01:56:59,266 --> 01:57:08,481
Let's come together to mend our broken hearts

1720
01:57:08,570 --> 01:57:17,194
This whirlwind, this busy life
What is it trying to tell you and me?

1721
01:57:17,444 --> 01:57:26,829
Come as you are, come love me
That's all I want, come set me free

1722
01:57:27,080 --> 01:57:36,164
A long time ago, I had given you my secrets

1723
01:57:36,164 --> 01:57:46,038
Let's come together to mend our broken hearts

1724
01:58:04,007 --> 01:58:13,181
You must have done something
to me it seems

1725
01:58:13,181 --> 01:58:22,646
Days like kings and nights like queens
Send me a thousand dreams

1726
01:58:22,646 --> 01:58:31,811
You must have done something
to me it seems

1727
01:58:31,811 --> 01:58:40,944
Days like kings and nights like queens
Send me a thousand dreams

1728
01:58:40,944 --> 01:58:49,568
This whirlwind, this busy life
What is it trying to tell you and me?

1729
01:58:50,159 --> 01:58:59,204
Come as you are, come love me
That's all I want, come set me free

1730
01:58:59,204 --> 01:59:08,537
A long time ago, I had given you my secrets

1731
01:59:08,537 --> 01:59:18,423
Let's come together to mend our broken hearts

1732
01:59:45,725 --> 01:59:55,020
I have persuaded myself
I belong to you

1733
01:59:55,020 --> 02:00:04,065
I have lost myself
In my love for you

1734
02:00:04,065 --> 02:00:13,278
This whirlwind, this busy life
What is it trying to tell you and me?

1735
02:00:13,278 --> 02:00:22,323
Come as you are, come love me
That's all I want, come set me free

1736
02:00:22,323 --> 02:00:31,668
A long time ago, I had given you my secrets

1737
02:00:31,668 --> 02:00:41,542
Let's come together to mend our broken hearts

1738
02:00:56,129 --> 02:00:58,050
Ishaan.

1739
02:00:58,050 --> 02:01:01,342
Hey, look what I found?
Chocolates.

1740
02:01:01,342 --> 02:01:02,473
You love it don't you?

1741
02:01:02,473 --> 02:01:04,093
You still remember?

1742
02:01:24,143 --> 02:01:25,693
Yeah, hello?

1743
02:01:26,854 --> 02:01:29,695
Yeah, I told you about that project.

1744
02:01:39,900 --> 02:01:42,901
Why is the car moving like that?

1745
02:01:48,284 --> 02:01:50,745
Khushi, have you gone crazy?

1746
02:01:50,745 --> 02:01:51,906
I didn't realise...

1747
02:01:51,906 --> 02:01:53,366
What do you mean?

1748
02:01:53,366 --> 02:01:54,827
Are you a child?

1749
02:01:57,248 --> 02:02:00,580
- That means our car also...
- Yeah, obviously...

1750
02:02:28,053 --> 02:02:31,595
The darker the colour of henna,
the better the husband.

1751
02:02:31,595 --> 02:02:32,845
Really?

1752
02:02:33,426 --> 02:02:36,347
Rahul will suffer anyway
if he is not a good husband.

1753
02:02:38,348 --> 02:02:41,810
Has the colour of your henna darkened?

1754
02:02:41,810 --> 02:02:42,730
Obviously.

1755
02:02:42,730 --> 02:02:43,930
Is that so?

1756
02:02:43,930 --> 02:02:46,562
You are so confident
that you'll get a good husband?

1757
02:02:46,562 --> 02:02:48,523
Ishaan is a nice guy.

1758
02:02:53,315 --> 02:02:54,986
Wait... Wait... Wait...

1759
02:02:55,356 --> 02:02:56,647
What did you just say?

1760
02:02:57,897 --> 02:02:58,988
Naughty!

1761
02:03:01,739 --> 02:03:02,990
But you know, Khushi...

1762
02:03:02,990 --> 02:03:04,571
This is destiny...

1763
02:03:04,571 --> 02:03:07,902
You and Ishaan meeting
after so many years like this.

1764
02:03:08,533 --> 02:03:10,364
It's really amazing!

1765
02:03:10,574 --> 02:03:14,116
Rahul, you're getting married!

1766
02:03:15,196 --> 02:03:18,998
And Ishaan, you're next.

1767
02:03:20,158 --> 02:03:21,539
Please shut up.

1768
02:03:21,999 --> 02:03:23,540
Then what are you going to do?

1769
02:03:23,540 --> 02:03:25,370
Are you going to be like this forever?

1770
02:03:25,370 --> 02:03:30,623
I have nothing to say to you
if you're so blind.

1771
02:03:30,623 --> 02:03:32,414
- What do you mean?
- What do I mean?

1772
02:03:32,414 --> 02:03:34,375
Oh my darling!

1773
02:03:34,505 --> 02:03:36,456
They have patched things up.

1774
02:03:36,456 --> 02:03:38,797
They are in a whirlwind romance now.

1775
02:03:38,797 --> 02:03:40,338
And I don't know anything?

1776
02:03:41,298 --> 02:03:43,299
It's not like that.

1777
02:03:43,299 --> 02:03:44,590
Are you sure?

1778
02:03:44,590 --> 02:03:45,840
Okay.

1779
02:03:46,591 --> 02:03:49,762
Then swear on me...

1780
02:03:49,762 --> 02:03:53,214
...that you're not attracted to Khushi.

1781
02:03:54,214 --> 02:03:56,715
Tell him.

1782
02:03:58,557 --> 02:03:59,967
Hey...

1783
02:04:04,599 --> 02:04:07,851
We've all had girlfriends in life...

1784
02:04:08,521 --> 02:04:11,853
But we can never forget our first love.

1785
02:04:13,433 --> 02:04:15,644
Khushi is my first love.

1786
02:04:16,565 --> 02:04:19,646
I've never liked anyone after her.

1787
02:04:19,646 --> 02:04:22,107
When you first came here...

1788
02:04:22,938 --> 02:04:25,399
The way Ishaan was...

1789
02:04:25,399 --> 02:04:26,940
And now...

1790
02:04:26,940 --> 02:04:29,031
He's completely changed.

1791
02:04:29,031 --> 02:04:30,612
What a difference!

1792
02:04:31,032 --> 02:04:32,903
I really can't believe it.

1793
02:04:33,153 --> 02:04:37,615
Ria, when I used to be naughty as a kid...

1794
02:04:37,786 --> 02:04:40,367
...my mom would stop talking to me.

1795
02:04:40,367 --> 02:04:42,367
She wouldn't even let me sleep beside her.

1796
02:04:42,367 --> 02:04:44,618
I used to sleep in the living room.

1797
02:04:44,618 --> 02:04:47,540
But when I used wake up,
I would find her right next to me.

1798
02:04:47,950 --> 02:04:51,452
Some people pretend to love us.

1799
02:04:51,452 --> 02:04:54,494
And some people pretend
to be angry with us.

1800
02:04:54,494 --> 02:04:58,705
And the ones who pretend to be angry,
truly love us.

1801
02:04:59,796 --> 02:05:02,878
The day I saw Khushi for the first time
on that train...

1802
02:05:02,878 --> 02:05:05,799
I felt a strange excitement in my heart.

1803
02:05:06,128 --> 02:05:09,710
I was scared that she might reject me.

1804
02:05:11,921 --> 02:05:14,093
The effort I put in to make Khushi say that
she loves me...

1805
02:05:14,093 --> 02:05:17,214
...I've never done that for anything else.

1806
02:05:18,385 --> 02:05:22,557
Finally when she said, "I love you",
in front of 2000 students in college...

1807
02:05:22,557 --> 02:05:25,178
I just couldn't contain my excitement...

1808
02:05:25,178 --> 02:05:29,560
I was celebrating all the festivals together.

1809
02:05:30,721 --> 02:05:34,972
Why did you stop?

1810
02:05:34,972 --> 02:05:36,514
What else can I say?

1811
02:05:38,434 --> 02:05:42,016
Even after everything she made me look bad
in front of the principal.

1812
02:05:42,016 --> 02:05:43,937
She made my love look bad.

1813
02:05:45,817 --> 02:05:47,689
Do you know what she told me?

1814
02:05:47,689 --> 02:05:50,940
That I'm impulsive...
I don't think about what I say...

1815
02:05:51,400 --> 02:05:53,731
It had taken me six months to make her say
that she loves me.

1816
02:05:53,731 --> 02:05:56,152
And it didn't even take her six minutes for her
to say that she hates me.

1817
02:05:56,442 --> 02:05:58,074
I'm done.

1818
02:05:58,404 --> 02:06:01,865
But she saved you from the police.

1819
02:06:01,865 --> 02:06:04,327
She helped me because I helped her.

1820
02:06:04,327 --> 02:06:05,907
I loved her then.

1821
02:06:05,907 --> 02:06:07,238
And she made a fool out of me.

1822
02:06:07,238 --> 02:06:09,159
She behaves according to the situation.

1823
02:06:09,159 --> 02:06:10,659
Calculated love...

1824
02:06:10,659 --> 02:06:13,451
She's behaving nicely today.
But tomorrow she might hurt you.

1825
02:06:13,451 --> 02:06:15,332
Once is enough for me.

1826
02:06:17,243 --> 02:06:19,744
You're saying all this now but...

1827
02:06:20,164 --> 02:06:23,876
...you'll forget all this the moment
you see her.

1828
02:06:24,125 --> 02:06:26,588
Change is not in my character.

1829
02:06:27,207 --> 02:06:30,249
I don't have the bad habit of forgetting.

1830
02:06:30,749 --> 02:06:33,921
It's possible I'm still attracted to her.

1831
02:06:35,002 --> 02:06:38,793
But love...
That's not there anymore...

1832
02:06:50,348 --> 02:06:52,179
Hey, what's up?

1833
02:07:34,199 --> 02:07:35,370
What's this?

1834
02:07:35,370 --> 02:07:37,911
Some of your things...

1835
02:07:42,163 --> 02:07:43,784
Why didn't you throw them away?

1836
02:07:44,455 --> 02:07:46,786
I didn't feel like
throwing them away then...

1837
02:07:46,786 --> 02:07:49,287
And now, I can't keep them with me.

1838
02:07:50,288 --> 02:07:53,748
Yes, Ishaan! I behave according
to the situation.

1839
02:07:53,919 --> 02:07:56,920
Because I think.
Because I contemplate.

1840
02:07:57,250 --> 02:08:01,543
I had spoken like that in college
to protect our love.

1841
02:08:01,543 --> 02:08:05,794
I had spoken like that with the police
to protect you.

1842
02:08:06,085 --> 02:08:08,045
I was not trying to make a fool of you.

1843
02:08:08,045 --> 02:08:09,386
I wasn't trying to help you either.

1844
02:08:09,797 --> 02:08:13,298
Even if you understand everything now,
I really don't care.

1845
02:08:13,588 --> 02:08:15,510
Because I'm done.

1846
02:08:16,720 --> 02:08:20,642
We've forgotten a 6 year old love
and travelled 6000 miles...

1847
02:08:20,642 --> 02:08:25,054
But you're still not over a 6 minute fight
we had in college.

1848
02:08:26,094 --> 02:08:27,645
Move on, Ishaan.

1849
02:08:27,685 --> 02:08:29,096
It's time.

1850
02:08:51,236 --> 02:08:56,659
Empty days, empty nights
The lights have gone out

1851
02:08:56,659 --> 02:09:02,532
Without you, my life's over
There's no doubt

1852
02:09:06,994 --> 02:09:12,416
Empty days, empty nights
The lights have gone out

1853
02:09:12,416 --> 02:09:17,039
Without you, my life's over
There's no doubt

1854
02:09:17,039 --> 02:09:22,462
This useless pride takes you far away

1855
02:09:22,462 --> 02:09:28,084
I want to stop myself
But I can't seem to do it anyway

1856
02:09:28,084 --> 02:09:33,257
Empty days, empty nights
The lights have gone out

1857
02:09:33,257 --> 02:09:38,509
Without you, my life's over
There's no doubt

1858
02:09:59,268 --> 02:10:20,279
Each time I try to talk to you
Each time you misunderstand me

1859
02:10:20,279 --> 02:10:25,451
Empty days, empty nights
The lights have gone out

1860
02:10:25,451 --> 02:10:30,904
Without you, my life's over
There's no doubt

1861
02:11:01,839 --> 02:11:22,928
How do you sleep at night?
When I burn like a question in your heart?

1862
02:11:25,020 --> 02:11:30,433
This useless pride takes you far away

1863
02:11:30,433 --> 02:11:35,895
I want to stop myself
But I can't seem to do it anyway

1864
02:11:35,895 --> 02:11:41,238
Empty days, empty nights
The lights have gone out

1865
02:11:41,238 --> 02:11:46,900
Without you, my life's over
There's no doubt

1866
02:12:10,621 --> 02:12:15,254
What's wrong?
Why are you sitting here alone?

1867
02:12:18,125 --> 02:12:21,376
I had given Khushi these things.

1868
02:12:21,376 --> 02:12:27,209
The first time we met on the train...
I had given her this jacket.

1869
02:12:33,052 --> 02:12:38,925
I had thrown this ring away.
But she had kept it all these years.

1870
02:12:42,177 --> 02:12:45,809
I had only sent you my graduation photos.

1871
02:12:46,019 --> 02:12:49,020
How did Khushi get them?

1872
02:12:49,020 --> 02:12:55,182
After you left for London,
Khushi had come to meet us.

1873
02:12:57,974 --> 02:13:00,106
How is Ishaan, aunty?

1874
02:13:00,106 --> 02:13:04,227
Please give me a chance to say sorry.

1875
02:13:04,227 --> 02:13:07,228
Khushi, please try to understand.

1876
02:13:07,779 --> 02:13:09,780
Ishaan is very disturbed.

1877
02:13:09,780 --> 02:13:14,532
I think he needs some space.

1878
02:13:18,444 --> 02:13:20,074
Six years later...

1879
02:13:20,865 --> 02:13:23,786
Khushi came home again, Ishaan.

1880
02:13:23,786 --> 02:13:28,618
Memories, good or bad, remain with us.

1881
02:13:28,618 --> 02:13:35,162
If we were wrong in our love, our break up
would have been a sensible one.

1882
02:13:37,203 --> 02:13:44,457
But our mistake was in our fight...
In our egos.

1883
02:13:44,797 --> 02:13:51,299
If only we could talk it over calmly,
we could have sorted everything out.

1884
02:13:51,299 --> 02:13:56,002
Please, aunty...
I want to talk to him...

1885
02:13:56,002 --> 02:13:57,923
I need him.

1886
02:13:57,923 --> 02:14:00,424
Mom, why didn't you tell me about this before?

1887
02:14:00,424 --> 02:14:06,097
Because you weren't in a state
to understand all this.

1888
02:14:07,507 --> 02:14:10,139
Do you know what your problem is?

1889
02:14:10,139 --> 02:14:14,431
You are mad at her
and you love her.

1890
02:14:14,431 --> 02:14:17,762
Your anger is keeping her away.

1891
02:14:17,762 --> 02:14:22,144
And your love is not letting her go.

1892
02:14:22,855 --> 02:14:26,066
Control your anger for a bit, my son.

1893
02:14:26,066 --> 02:14:30,318
Otherwise you might lose a lot in life.

1894
02:14:33,149 --> 02:14:40,483
She loved me before she said she loved me.
And she loves me after she said she hated me.

1895
02:14:41,824 --> 02:14:50,448
So much time has passed
but I still haven't been able to forget her.

1896
02:14:51,949 --> 02:14:55,490
I've lost her once.

1897
02:14:55,490 --> 02:14:58,031
I can't lose her again.

1898
02:15:26,215 --> 02:15:27,256
This one?

1899
02:15:27,926 --> 02:15:29,006
Ria?

1900
02:15:29,847 --> 02:15:31,677
Where's Khushi?

1901
02:15:32,468 --> 02:15:34,639
I haven't seen her in a while.

1902
02:15:34,639 --> 02:15:37,350
Oh, okay.

1903
02:15:38,431 --> 02:15:39,761
Ishaan...

1904
02:16:11,366 --> 02:16:17,820
Khushi, where are you?
I just need one clue...

1905
02:16:41,881 --> 02:16:44,082
What are you doing here?

1906
02:16:45,633 --> 02:16:49,215
I am trying to distance myself
from a few things.

1907
02:16:49,835 --> 02:16:52,006
If you wanted to stay away
then why did you come close?

1908
02:16:52,006 --> 02:16:55,087
I wanted that before.
Not anymore.

1909
02:16:55,087 --> 02:16:56,548
Khushi...

1910
02:16:59,590 --> 02:17:03,431
I shouldn't have said those things.

1911
02:17:03,431 --> 02:17:05,553
I am sorry.

1912
02:17:05,553 --> 02:17:07,683
Please stay back.

1913
02:17:07,683 --> 02:17:09,474
Why?

1914
02:17:11,805 --> 02:17:14,347
For Rahul's reception.

1915
02:17:14,347 --> 02:17:17,598
Then, I can leave after the reception, right?

1916
02:17:17,598 --> 02:17:21,350
No, that's not what I meant.

1917
02:17:22,311 --> 02:17:25,442
Khushi, I...

1918
02:17:26,272 --> 02:17:27,523
I need you.

1919
02:17:27,523 --> 02:17:30,945
Where were you when I needed you?

1920
02:17:30,945 --> 02:17:35,567
Six years... Not a single phone call...
Not a single message.

1921
02:17:35,567 --> 02:17:38,158
I still came to you.

1922
02:17:38,158 --> 02:17:40,489
And what did you say?

1923
02:17:40,489 --> 02:17:46,242
I calculate my love...
I behave according to the situation...

1924
02:17:46,612 --> 02:17:48,993
You could say so casually
that there is no love between us.

1925
02:17:48,993 --> 02:17:50,614
Yes, I did.

1926
02:17:50,614 --> 02:17:52,995
But I said it out of anger.

1927
02:17:53,535 --> 02:17:57,827
Not from the heart...
It was from the head...

1928
02:17:57,827 --> 02:18:02,619
You've said you hate me
and you've still come back to me.

1929
02:18:02,619 --> 02:18:05,421
It's just the same.

1930
02:18:05,421 --> 02:18:10,753
We say a lot of things when we're angry
that we don't mean. You know that.

1931
02:18:14,716 --> 02:18:18,468
There are two things in my life
that have bothered me the most.

1932
02:18:18,468 --> 02:18:24,010
One is chocolate and the other is you.

1933
02:18:24,340 --> 02:18:26,631
You know what I would do as a kid?

1934
02:18:26,631 --> 02:18:29,263
I used to polish off packs of chocolates.

1935
02:18:29,263 --> 02:18:32,554
I had become fat because of chocolates.

1936
02:18:33,514 --> 02:18:37,056
People would laugh at me...
Just like you.

1937
02:18:37,687 --> 02:18:40,478
One day I felt very angry.

1938
02:18:40,478 --> 02:18:43,560
Not at the ones who laughed at me.

1939
02:18:43,560 --> 02:18:45,520
But at chocolates.

1940
02:18:45,520 --> 02:18:51,814
I had thrown away all the chocolates.
Comepletely stopped having them.

1941
02:18:51,814 --> 02:18:57,356
With time, I stopped craving chocolates.

1942
02:18:57,356 --> 02:19:03,149
After our fight, I thought
I would forget you if I didn't see you.

1943
02:19:03,149 --> 02:19:05,820
That's why I stayed away from you.

1944
02:19:07,901 --> 02:19:10,032
But you know what?

1945
02:19:11,153 --> 02:19:13,153
I was wrong.

1946
02:19:15,955 --> 02:19:19,907
Because I just liked chocolates.

1947
02:19:20,707 --> 02:19:22,908
That's why I could forget it.

1948
02:19:22,908 --> 02:19:27,330
But for you, I have love.

1949
02:19:28,410 --> 02:19:31,252
That's why I couldn't forget you.

1950
02:19:32,543 --> 02:19:36,004
Khushi, change is not in my character.

1951
02:19:36,004 --> 02:19:38,546
But I have changed.

1952
02:19:39,336 --> 02:19:41,667
Only for you.

1953
02:19:42,507 --> 02:19:48,590
You are my one bad habit that I can't quit.
In fact, I don't want to quit.

1954
02:19:48,880 --> 02:19:52,723
I thought I have left you behind a long time ago.

1955
02:19:53,343 --> 02:19:59,886
But you've always been with me...
Right here.

1956
02:20:01,557 --> 02:20:09,601
I don't know how much I love you.
Or what I can or can't do for you.

1957
02:20:10,021 --> 02:20:15,734
I just know that I can't live without you.

1958
02:20:18,485 --> 02:20:20,987
I love you, Khushi.

1959
02:20:21,986 --> 02:20:24,068
Please take me back.

1960
02:20:30,320 --> 02:20:34,032
You had asked me to be your Lord Rama
that day.

1961
02:20:34,993 --> 02:20:36,784
Will you be my Sita?

1962
02:20:37,655 --> 02:20:42,286
I've been ready since that day.

1963
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:53,581
If you kiss me,
you'll have to marry me.
