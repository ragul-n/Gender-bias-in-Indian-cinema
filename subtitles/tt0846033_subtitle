1
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:27,793
I could stand here with you forever.

2
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,669
Then you should, my love.

3
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,230
It is time.

4
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,076
I must go.

5
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:45,240
No, you must not do that please.

6
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,474
They will only tear us apart.

7
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,714
I will never let that happen.

8
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,436
I will convince them.

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,354
Please trust me.

10
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,672
You cannot change
the prejudice of your family.

11
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,470
But, I can try.

12
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,997
I will show them the purity of our love.

13
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,715
They will never understand
such a love as ours.

14
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,360
Their's is a world filled
with greed and hatred.

15
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,193
How can you risk what we have?

16
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,430
There is no other way.

17
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,352
I must protect us by facing them.

18
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,800
No. There must be.

19
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:18,151
No, let me go, let me go,

20
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,514
you're hurting me.

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:21,877
I am sorry.

22
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,398
Please heed my words!

23
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:02,677
Father.

24
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,280
Father, please,

25
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,670
I have come to...

26
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,876
Do not speak!

27
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,832
Why do you continue
to defy me like this

28
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:26,675
and reject all that our great family
holds so dear.

29
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,200
No, I...

30
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:35,275
By throwing yourself at that foul animal
you denounced our deity,

31
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,875
our culture, and your own future...

32
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,474
We have done no such thing!

33
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:48,231
M y whole life I've only honored you
and tried to fill you with pride.

34
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,995
Pride! I am filled with disgust.

35
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,276
M y love is a man you've never known.

36
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,470
No more of this!

37
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:02,872
Either you do exactly as I tell you
and honor the tradition as a daughter

38
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:07,113
or I will hunt that pagan down
and send him to the fires of narakha.

39
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,760
You know not what you say!

40
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,717
Silence!

41
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,038
No!

42
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,636
Maya, are you okay?

43
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,760
Yeah, I am fine.

44
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:26,675
I just keep having these weird,
lucid dreams.

45
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,873
They're getting more and more vivid.

46
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,277
Really?

47
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,631
How so?

48
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,516
Well, I woke up in the middle
of the night last night

49
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:41,959
with this dream mirroring
the Shiva/Shakti legend.

50
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,836
Again?

51
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,072
Yeah. Only this time,

52
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:47,997
I was in it.

53
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,356
You see, honey.

54
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,600
I told you were studying way too hard.

55
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,754
The stuff is starting to seep
into your subconscious.

56
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,471
I guess.

57
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,954
Maya, come on.

58
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,154
We've made it here.

59
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,797
You should be so happy.

60
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,031
Come here.

61
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,511
I am.

62
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,155
I'm just thinking.

63
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,480
About what, honey?

64
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,677
You know, this is the home
of my parents.

65
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,760
And my parents parents.

66
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,352
Yet... they never came back here.

67
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,277
They never revisited their family home.

68
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,158
You'd think at some point
they'd want to come back

69
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,515
but they never did.

70
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,360
Yeah, I wonder why?

71
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,594
I could never find out

72
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,515
from either of them.

73
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,319
I was lucky to have found the address
in my father's old diary.

74
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,159
I just hope somebody still lives there.

75
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,199
All the letters I sent were sent back
to me as "Return to Sender".

76
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,434
Sounds to me like someone's trying
to keep the skeletons

77
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,591
in the old family closet hidden, huh?

78
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,996
Well I guess we'll find out...

79
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,678
Coming to India
to gather information

80
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,797
for my thesis is so important,

81
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,749
but finding out more
about my family's background,

82
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,873
that's the real reason I came here.

83
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,519
Have you been here before, madam?

84
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,515
No. This is our first time to India.

85
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,800
Manicka Periyaveedu is
where you are going?

86
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:34,957
Yes.

87
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:37,957
Are you sure!

88
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,870
You want to go there.

89
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:43,035
Yes. I am sure.

90
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:44,677
Why?

91
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,520
Have you been there before?

92
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,956
I once went there long time ago.

93
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:52,155
But, no one goes there anymore.

94
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,952
Maya. It's so beautiful.

95
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,398
I hope that
we get a chance to stay here.

96
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,590
You want to stay here?

97
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,794
Yeah. Why not?

98
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,070
Where are you going?

99
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,591
No. No. I cannot stay here any longer.

100
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,677
What?

101
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,511
Hello. I am Maya Krishnan,
Krishnan's daughter.

102
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:25,830
Welcome Maya.

103
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,633
I am your Aunt Maya.

104
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,030
I've been waiting ages for you.

105
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,319
I am honored to meet you.

106
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,077
This is my best friend, Alexandria.

107
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:35,911
Call me Alex.

108
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,912
It is lovely to meet you, Aunt Maya.

109
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,280
Alex, you better learn to say Namaste.

110
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,270
That's pretty good.

111
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:50,230
Yes. It is excellent for one
who does not know our culture.

112
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,756
Please, wait here.

113
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,310
You are welcome here.

114
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,229
Please come inside.

115
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,356
You must be tired.

116
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:31,958
No, Aunt Maya,
we're not actually tired at all.

117
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,910
I'm actually quite surprised
to find you here.

118
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,035
Really?
And why would you say that?

119
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,080
Because I sent several letters
regarding my arrival to India

120
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,277
but I never had any response.

121
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,159
Strangely, they never arrived.

122
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,237
Well, the postal service
is most unreliable here.

123
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:55,951
Come.

124
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,160
Maya, this is your home.

125
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:03,798
You belong here,
not somewhere faraway.

126
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,878
I insist that you stay here.

127
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,840
Appu will get your things.

128
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,397
Appu?

129
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:14,311
Yes, he is the caretaker
of this Priyaveedu.

130
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,834
You will meet him soon enough.

131
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,195
Will you stay?

132
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,674
- Yes.
- Yes.

133
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,271
W onderful. Please follow me.

134
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,876
Maya, this is your room.

135
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,880
I hope you'll be happy here.

136
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,750
I'm sure I will.

137
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:55,479
This is a beautiful statue
of Ardhanareswara.

138
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,677
Aunt Maya,
your painting is amazing.

139
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:03,589
Thank you.
That one is my most favorite.

140
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,711
Maya, this is your bed.

141
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,397
It is made of medicinal wood.

142
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,475
No one exactly knows how old it is

143
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:17,558
but it has been in our family
for many centuries.

144
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,833
You mean you sleep on bare wood?

145
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,913
No pillows? No mattress?

146
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,431
Oh yes.

147
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,916
Only then you will get the full benefit.

148
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,796
The lovers must have
had strong backs.

149
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,071
Alex.

150
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,277
What, it's true.

151
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:36,279
Excuse me,
what do you mean Alexandria?

152
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:41,719
Sex on this bed, I just thought it
will be a bit uncomfortable, you know,

153
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,837
maybe a little painful

154
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:47,550
Pain and pleasure
are two sides of the same coin,

155
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,116
the dividing line is very thin...

156
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,271
Come Alexandria,
I will show you your room.

157
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,073
You mean we have separate rooms.

158
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,310
Of course,

159
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,720
this house has many rooms.

160
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:09,080
Most of them are vacant, you know.

161
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,477
This Periyaveedu
once belonged to a Prince.

162
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,031
It was from him
that it came to our family.

163
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,231
Really, do you know how?

164
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,560
It was a long time ago.

165
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,999
This house has many stories.

166
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:24,197
I would very much like to hear them.

167
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:28,037
Of course, but first get settled here.

168
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,716
I am sure it has been
a long journey for you.

169
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:34,597
And then I will tell you anything
that you need to know.

170
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:40,509
Excellent, I have so many questions.

171
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:44,273
And in time,
you will have many answers.

172
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,036
Alexandria, this is your room.

173
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,870
Is this also a medicinal bed?

174
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,838
No. However,

175
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:12,391
this room is given only to the honored
guests of the family.

176
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,398
This room is spotless.

177
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,557
Thank you.

178
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,350
Please make yourself
comfortable and relax.

179
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,431
Thank you, Aunt Maya.

180
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,795
You've been so kind.

181
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,514
Don't thank me, Maya.

182
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,680
It is my pleasure
to finally meet the child

183
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,956
born in the land beyond the oceans.

184
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,999
Well at least yours is soft!

185
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,517
Come, check it out.

186
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,314
Hello? Are you Appu?

187
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:12,549
Are you here for the hotels address
to collect our bags?

188
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:21,556
Here Appu.

189
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,000
It was nice meeting you.

190
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,754
What a character!

191
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,670
I know!

192
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,432
I wonder why he is acting so strange?

193
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,596
Maybe he got up on
the wrong side of the bed today?

194
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,831
Well, if his bed is anything like yours,

195
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:00,230
I would imagine
he would be eternally pissed.

196
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,839
Looks like some kind
of refreshments.

197
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,600
That's exactly what we need.

198
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,234
Toddy, you like?

199
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,117
Yeah...

200
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:17,997
You like.

201
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:18,957
I like.

202
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,556
Enjo y...

203
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,191
- Alex.
- Yeah.

204
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:10,758
Do you, do you see that over there?

205
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:13,551
What is that?

206
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:15,717
What is that?

207
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,354
Let's go see what it is.

208
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,509
Appu, I'm sorry
if we got off on the wrong foot.

209
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,359
What is with that guy?

210
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,276
Please don't mind.

211
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,154
He is afraid of new people.

212
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,476
But, somebody should teach him
some manners.

213
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:59,479
He is a simple man,
stuck in the past.

214
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:03,236
And you are the first visitors
that we've had in a long, long time.

215
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,154
Please don't feel offended.

216
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:09,197
His thinking is just little antiquated.

217
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:10,832
Please...

218
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,759
- Aunt Maya.
- Yes.

219
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,716
How was it like growing up
around here?

220
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,710
Was it as beautiful
and majestic as it is now?

221
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:27,709
Oh yes. Our family
was indeed very prosperous

222
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,870
when I was a young girl.

223
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,240
We had many advantages

224
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,960
that most people
in Tamil Nadu never dreamed.

225
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,675
Really, like what?

226
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:38,389
Like I had a tutor
when I was a little girl,

227
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,870
which was very uncommon.

228
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,838
I had the advantage
to do many things

229
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:45,310
which girls of my time could not.

230
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:51,032
Really? It sounds like your father
was as forward thinking as mine was.

231
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,395
Yes, he was.

232
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,277
He just...

233
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:59,195
did not truly understand
the nature of who I was.

234
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,916
I'm sorry
if I brought up a bad memory.

235
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:11,116
No, it's all right.

236
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:16,592
Such things are ancient history
and long resolved.

237
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:22,440
As you can see,
my friend loves to eat.

238
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,878
As long as it settles
in all the right places,

239
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,792
I can eat all I want.

240
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,232
It's good to satisfy such cravings.

241
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,679
So, are you enjo ying
your stay so far?

242
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,470
Yeah. We went
and saw all the sites of Ooty.

243
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,153
It's such a magical place.

244
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,517
I feel as though
I belong here already.

245
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,078
And, today we plan on getting lost
in the beauty of the forest.

246
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:49,115
The forest. It's beautiful.

247
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:52,156
Is there any place
that you recommend for us to see?

248
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:55,558
There are many caves in the forest
which are captivating.

249
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:58,953
Really? I would love to see them.

250
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,800
I think studying them
would help me with my thesis!

251
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,230
How do we find them?

252
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:06,270
It's been so long
since I've been there.

253
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,077
I can't give you exact directions,

254
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,398
but you'll know
when you will be close.

255
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:12,472
How?

256
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,074
By the stillness of the air,

257
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:21,312
when you can only hear
the sound of your breath

258
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,993
and the rhythm of your heart beat,

259
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:27,878
you will find the trail
that will lead you to them.

260
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,516
Sounds incredible!

261
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:34,433
It will seem so perfect
and so tranquil,

262
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,718
like you are home for the first time

263
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,512
in a long, long time.

264
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:46,394
We definitely have to go there!
Right, Alex?

265
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:52,235
Please, leave the plates.
Appu will take care of them...

266
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,756
Thanks, Aunt Maya.

267
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,275
Sorry for the trouble.

268
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,036
No trouble at all.

269
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:57,951
You are family.

270
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,470
Hey Maya...

271
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,317
take a look.

272
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,359
Why don't you go look for your caves?

273
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,159
I think I may stay here for a while.

274
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,556
I'll catch up with you later.

275
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,792
M y friend Alex the sleuth.

276
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,875
You know me

277
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,792
always trying to get
to the bottom of things.

278
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,679
- I'll meet you here later.
- Okay.

279
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,031
Milind?

280
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,520
Oh Milind.

281
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,958
By thr stillness of the air,

282
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:48,634
when you can only hear
the sound of your breath

283
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,753
and the rhythm of your heart beat,

284
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,160
you will find the trail

285
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,879
the will lead you to them.

286
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:12,831
Who's there?

287
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,719
I said, who's there?

288
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,196
You've had your fun,
now stop this game.

289
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,556
I'll say when the fun is over.

290
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,835
Give me my clothes!

291
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,996
That's not the way to talk to a lady.

292
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:39,158
A lady would not steal
a bare man's clothes.

293
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,516
But a vixen might?

294
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:44,515
There aren't any indigenous vixens
in these parts.

295
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,880
One must import them
for leisure to be framed on the rock,

296
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,351
only in the midst of waiting
for her mate

297
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,554
to present the day's kill.

298
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,156
You have a great imagination.

299
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,756
A painter has to have
a bountiful imagination.

300
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,190
What are you laughing at?

301
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,153
Well, Mr. Painter.

302
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,755
You aren't shy.

303
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,872
The flesh is to be reveled
and celebrated.

304
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,599
Besides, what am I suppose to do?

305
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,194
Hide my loins with a leaf?

306
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,754
You need much more than a leaf
to hide that, Milind.

307
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,399
Why you?

308
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,391
Wait...

309
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,070
How do you know my name?

310
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:30,679
Your wallet fell out of your trousers
and I couldn't help but notice your ID.

311
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,555
Mischievous fox I meet, nonetheless!

312
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,079
And what is your name, Ms. Vixen?

313
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:41,719
I like that. I like that a lot.

314
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,277
Alexandria.

315
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,634
In time,
all things transcend their very nature

316
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,120
and flow as they were meant to.

317
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,872
Welcome to my humble Gruham.

318
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,995
Oh, thank you.

319
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,236
I am sorry to intrude I was...

320
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:39,040
So you are curious by nature,
thirsting for knowledge?

321
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,911
Yes. I'm Maya.

322
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,673
A stranger in this country.

323
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,513
There are no strangers in this world.

324
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:51,280
Your name, do you know its meaning?

325
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,470
It has many meanings.

326
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:58,600
The reflection of the Infinite Being
in the material world is the one I prefer,

327
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,754
over just an illusion.

328
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:05,833
And what brings you here, Maya?

329
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,629
Luck, I guess,

330
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:13,074
and I'm working on my thesis
about the Goddess Parvati.

331
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:14,951
Interesting.

332
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:20,399
Your gruham, its incredible.

333
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,956
It's nothing
like I have ever seen or studied.

334
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:26,200
I can't believe such
a wondrous place exists.

335
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:31,039
Life is much more interesting
than the books.

336
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:34,796
You can acquire knowledge
from a manual,

337
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:40,753
but the art of what is learned
must be practiced in the flesh.

338
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:46,592
This is an impressive representation
of Shiva and Shakti.

339
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:50,673
Indeed, quite ancient too.

340
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:56,114
The feminine here is represented
in the form of his first wife Sati.

341
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,552
Oh, yes. I can see it now.

342
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:02,671
I've always thought of the tale
of the Infinite Being as beautiful,

343
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,598
yet profoundly sad.

344
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,077
In what way?

345
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:14,432
Shiva losing his first wife Sati
because of the ways of her father.

346
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:19,631
I suppose she had no choice,
and did it only out of love.

347
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:25,153
There is great sadness in his loss, but...

348
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,113
Sati is reincarnated.

349
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:29,956
She comes back to him.

350
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,593
And in the end they are one.

351
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,680
And what are you making over here?

352
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:45,751
Kama Rasa.

353
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,357
Love potion?

354
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,157
Yes.

355
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,315
Does it really work?

356
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:56,790
In conjunction with practicing
Vatsyayana's techniques.

357
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,200
The Kama Sutra.

358
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:04,833
Yes. The classic wisdom of his work
is a true path to enlightenment.

359
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,831
It taps into the human body's desires,

360
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,039
erasing conflicting emotions,

361
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:13,794
and leads the student
to the clarity of it all.

362
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:18,037
Really?

363
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,590
It's getting late.

364
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,360
I must meet my friends.

365
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:29,595
May I return tomorrow
and speak with you some more?

366
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:31,712
It would be helpful

367
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:34,599
if I could ask you some questions
regarding my thesis.

368
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:35,431
Of course.

369
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,478
You are welcome here
anytime you like.

370
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,269
Thank you, Mitra.

371
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:25,630
All right, come here. Well,

372
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:32,080
and this side up.

373
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,475
Good morning, Aunt Maya.

374
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,470
How are you today?

375
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:15,671
W onderful.

376
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,911
Today is such a beautiful
and vital day.

377
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:18,792
And you?

378
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,310
I'm ok.

379
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:24,391
I am just a little curious
where Maya is.

380
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:27,075
Oh yes. I saw her earlier.

381
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,716
I think she was going
into the forest again,

382
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,473
to the caves that she discovered.

383
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:36,159
I see. That explains it.

384
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,594
I guess I'll see her later then.

385
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:39,597
Yes.

386
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:43,196
And I'm sure she will be brimming
with exciting things to tell us of.

387
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:45,756
Aunt Maya...

388
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,835
W ould you mind
if I took your picture?

389
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,477
Picture?

390
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,433
Why would you want to take my picture?

391
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,439
Oh, you're so beautiful.

392
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:59,800
And I would love to have a memento
of our most gracious host...

393
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:01,631
May I?

394
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:02,472
Okay.

395
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:13,996
Thank you.

396
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,839
W ould you show me the photos?

397
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,510
Of course.

398
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:18,875
I'll make you a set.

399
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,631
I don't have any pictures of myself.

400
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,516
Really?

401
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,670
I'm surprised.

402
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,593
Life is full of surprises.

403
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:46,997
This is a rare Ayurvedic oil.

404
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:48,871
What does it do?

405
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,400
It helps in many ways.

406
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,758
Keeps the hair long and healthy.

407
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:06,554
Seeps into your pores
and opens the mind.

408
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,514
Smells of sandalwood.

409
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,559
The comb is made of sandalwood.

410
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,800
The oil is odorless.

411
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,751
Please, let me comb your hair.

412
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:29,431
Don't sneak up on people like that.

413
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:32,714
You see only what you want to see.

414
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,193
What the hell are you talking about?

415
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:37,757
I...

416
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,391
I...

417
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,800
you should have never come here.

418
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:42,871
What do you mean?

419
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:57,750
Sit there.

420
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:43,873
You're right. It feels wonderful.

421
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:32,034
Milind, are you painting
my back view today?

422
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:34,110
Not exactly.

423
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,635
What are you doing?

424
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:45,151
I am creating something different.

425
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:47,471
- Trust me.
- Okay.

426
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:29,510
You just got paint all over me.

427
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:32,069
I'm sorry. I meant to.

428
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:14,476
What are these leaves?

429
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:20,030
They are a rare and forgotten catalyst.

430
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:26,311
They stimulate nerve ends
and open one's deeper desires.

431
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:30,835
The great ancestors of this land
knew those secrets and shared them

432
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:31,831
with their acolytes.

433
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:34,913
That knowledge vanished through

434
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:38,357
time and the divine properties
of the leaves

435
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:41,753
was deemed unfit for man.

436
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:48,070
I can feel the heat rising in my body.

437
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:54,677
Mitra, I can't bear this torture...

438
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:58,592
This is the torture of desire.

439
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:03,956
It only increases the ultimate jo ys
of the union of male and female.

440
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:09,596
The highest peak
of pleasure known to mankind

441
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:12,559
is to simply surrender
your conscious mind.

442
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:15,794
Open it so that you will be complete.

443
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:20,871
Untie me...

444
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:22,151
please...

445
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:24,835
it's painful.

446
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:28,880
Pain and pleasure
are two sides of the same coin.

447
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,277
The dividing line is very thin.

448
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:32,197
This sari has been
in our family for decades.

449
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:38,430
Aunt Maya, it's gorgeous.

450
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:41,836
Is it yours?

451
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,195
It was.

452
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:50,120
But now it's yours.

453
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:54,635
Here, let me help you try it on.

454
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:06,396
And what was it like for you.

455
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:09,949
Your first time?

456
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:13,277
Your first love?

457
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:19,072
I mean, all of this, in my mind,

458
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:22,518
in my heart, in my body,

459
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:26,195
I have never known.

460
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:31,356
M y love,

461
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:45,357
my first and only love,

462
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:55,438
I will never forget.

463
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:02,592
No matter what time passes,

464
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:07,994
he is always with me.

465
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:11,236
In my dreams,

466
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:15,150
in my thoughts,

467
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:22,030
in everything...

468
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:35,760
So these feelings will always be?

469
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:38,797
Yes.

470
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:42,276
Like a flame,

471
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:46,754
you will feel the warmth
and the light

472
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:50,035
as well as the pain.

473
00:50:56,240 --> 00:51:00,393
Look, how lovely
you look in this sari, Maya.

474
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:03,512
You now belong to this land.

475
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:09,349
Thank you, Aunt Maya.

476
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:13,073
Thank you so much.

477
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:26,433
So, did you see them?

478
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:27,551
How'd they look?

479
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:30,280
Not bad. Some of them
didn't turn out right.

480
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:31,551
What do you mean?

481
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:32,750
Those shots right there.

482
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:34,559
It all came out strange.

483
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:36,357
What?

484
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:40,200
Why are all the shots of Maya
and the Mansion screwed up?

485
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:42,680
Are you sure this studio is alright?

486
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:44,271
Yeah.

487
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:46,556
Look, the forest pictures
came out right.

488
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:47,790
But how?

489
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:50,515
Why would these be okay
and everything else messed up?

490
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:51,557
I don't know.

491
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:53,472
Maybe the lighting
was wrong or something?

492
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:57,398
Look, I never take such crappy photos.

493
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:59,239
It's not the end of the world.

494
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:33,511
Good morning, Mitra.

495
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:40,759
Every morning is like this, Maya.

496
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:45,680
You look lovely in that sari,

497
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:48,991
like a Tamil Queen of a previous birth.

498
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:00,712
Mitra?

499
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:03,671
Yes Maya.

500
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,036
M y heart is yours.

501
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:15,356
And mine yours.

502
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:28,831
But there's more.

503
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:30,834
The film not being right.

504
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:33,238
And the strange servant Appu.

505
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:36,199
And every time I see Aunt Maya
she looks different.

506
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:37,518
Really?

507
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:39,320
And what does Maya think of all this?

508
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:41,478
I'm not sure. She's been busy.

509
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:45,312
In the last two weeks the only time
I've seen her is at the dining table

510
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:47,995
and every time we start to talk,
we get interrupted.

511
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,639
Sounds like you
just have nosy servants

512
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:52,757
and relatives relishing in the fact

513
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:53,956
that they have someone
to dote on again.

514
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:57,112
I keep on telling myself that,
but I'm just not sure.

515
00:58:58,520 --> 00:59:02,434
Look, you've said it's been a long time
since the place has had visitors.

516
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:05,479
Your friend Maya
is always gone working on her thesis.

517
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:11,434
So, you're in a big, lifeless house,
in a place you've never been in.

518
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:15,556
Our minds have a way of playing tricks
on us in such situations.

519
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:17,350
Maybe.

520
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:21,239
Look, everything's fine.

521
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:23,073
Go have a talk with your friend.

522
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:26,960
If that doesn't do it,
take a walk around the house.

523
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:29,440
I am sure you will end up scaring yourself

524
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:30,715
before anything happens.

525
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:08,672
M y god. I never imagined
that it could be like this.

526
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:13,758
I did'nt think
that I could ever experience such...

527
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:20,358
Maya, the body and soul are one.

528
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:25,032
Sex and love are the purest way
that man can celebrate

529
01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:26,634
and join with the Divine.

530
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:00,911
Hello!

531
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:12,077
Who's there.

532
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:49,592
Shit!

533
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:26,880
You should have listened to me.

534
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:30,754
I tried to warn you.

535
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:32,440
What is wrong with this place?

536
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:35,680
This is Manicka Periya Veedu...

537
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:38,670
There are spirits in the night air...

538
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:41,912
I know. I've seen them.

539
01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:44,313
She is searching for someone

540
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:47,555
who can bring her
back to the land of living...

541
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:49,279
Once inside...

542
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:52,232
she will never go away.

543
01:02:52,360 --> 01:02:53,635
What about Maya?

544
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:58,038
Her fate is sealed.

545
01:02:58,360 --> 01:02:59,999
I can't just leave her here!

546
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:06,749
What should I do?

547
01:03:07,160 --> 01:03:08,230
Take this book.

548
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:14,160
It is a book that holds the key
to saving your friend

549
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:21,152
and freeing her soul from the curse.

550
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:41,799
Go away, please go away,
before it's too late.

551
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:13,316
Seems to be an ancient
book of Indian mythology.

552
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:15,471
How is that supposed to help Maya?

553
01:04:15,640 --> 01:04:18,838
I don't know,
a guy just died giving you this.

554
01:04:21,840 --> 01:04:23,035
I just need some time.

555
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:25,995
I know very well
that something happened to her.

556
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:29,835
You don't know that for sure.

557
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:32,555
Everything is going to be ok.

558
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:34,838
Come here...

559
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:44,640
I really don't know
what I would do without you.

560
01:05:32,360 --> 01:05:33,077
What is that?

561
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:35,031
It's a palm leaf.

562
01:05:35,120 --> 01:05:37,112
I found it in the tome
that Appu gave to you.

563
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:38,077
A palm leaf?

564
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:43,870
Yes. Leafs like this are almost
like maps or keys to a puzzle.

565
01:05:44,560 --> 01:05:46,711
Prophets have been using them
for thousands of years.

566
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:48,477
What does it say?

567
01:05:48,560 --> 01:05:50,438
I mean, can you decipher it?

568
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:54,194
No. A very few people can.

569
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:56,671
Our best bet
is to go to the nearest temple,

570
01:05:56,760 --> 01:05:58,911
hopefully the priest there
will be able to help us.

571
01:05:59,000 --> 01:05:59,956
And what about the book?

572
01:06:01,640 --> 01:06:03,313
I'll explain this all to you later.

573
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:03,958
Let's go.

574
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:04,791
Wait.

575
01:06:05,080 --> 01:06:06,434
Let's go to the house first.

576
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:08,359
I want to see if Maya has returned.

577
01:06:08,680 --> 01:06:09,636
Are you sure?

578
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:10,797
Yes.

579
01:06:22,080 --> 01:06:25,357
Oh my god, I can't believe my eyes.

580
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:29,358
Well, believe it. Come, let's go.

581
01:06:32,560 --> 01:06:34,870
Wait here. Let me get her.

582
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:35,717
What?

583
01:06:35,800 --> 01:06:37,598
She'll get startled if we both go in.

584
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:39,560
Just let me do this.

585
01:07:04,040 --> 01:07:05,759
Hello, my sweet Alexandria.

586
01:07:06,680 --> 01:07:08,797
And how are you
this auspicious evening?

587
01:07:09,160 --> 01:07:10,560
What are you doing?

588
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:13,799
I am preparing myself for my love.

589
01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:15,434
Why do you ask?

590
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:17,400
Oh my god!

591
01:07:18,360 --> 01:07:20,192
What happened to your wrists?

592
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:22,671
Nothing.

593
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:24,799
They are the impressions of love.

594
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:29,832
They are a testament
to the evolution of one's being.

595
01:07:32,120 --> 01:07:36,239
Honey, where were you earlier?

596
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:40,911
I was dancing throughout the world
with my beloved Mitra.

597
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:43,873
Why are you so concerned?

598
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:45,510
Listen to me.

599
01:07:48,040 --> 01:07:49,076
This room?

600
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:51,155
Tell me what you see!

601
01:07:53,080 --> 01:07:55,311
I see a beautiful pristine room.

602
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:58,669
A reflection of my being fully realized.

603
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:02,040
What are you talking about?

604
01:08:05,240 --> 01:08:07,357
Honey, you're not safe here.

605
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:09,520
Please come with me now.

606
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:12,038
You're the one who is unsafe.

607
01:08:13,040 --> 01:08:16,033
You should be inebriated
with the passions of your painter.

608
01:08:16,240 --> 01:08:17,720
What else is there but love?

609
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:23,559
Listen, you must come with me now.

610
01:08:23,640 --> 01:08:24,437
No.

611
01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:25,351
Maya.

612
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:27,279
I said no.

613
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:29,193
What is wrong with you honey?

614
01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:32,200
I am alive for the first time in ages!

615
01:08:33,240 --> 01:08:35,835
I watched the sun set
over my homeland

616
01:08:37,080 --> 01:08:40,232
and finally blossomed
into the woman I meant to be.

617
01:08:46,280 --> 01:08:47,634
I love you.

618
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:50,392
Please come with me now.

619
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:12,760
What are you talking about?

620
01:09:23,840 --> 01:09:27,390
No. I don't need it.

621
01:09:46,120 --> 01:09:47,474
What are your names?

622
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:49,711
I am Milind.

623
01:09:50,680 --> 01:09:54,356
This is Alexandria and this is Maya.

624
01:09:55,320 --> 01:09:58,199
The child from beyond the oceans.

625
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:00,593
God bless you all...

626
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:02,840
especially

627
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:06,233
our dear Maya.

628
01:10:07,240 --> 01:10:11,951
Sir, is there anything you can tell us
about the palm leaf or about Maya?

629
01:10:12,760 --> 01:10:14,672
They were a great family.

630
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:21,274
She was the daughter

631
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:23,479
many years ago

632
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:27,191
she was very beautiful,

633
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:33,834
artistic.

634
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:36,910
She could sing

635
01:10:40,680 --> 01:10:41,796
paint

636
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:45,595
and dance

637
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:51,752
she was the youngest daughter
of the family

638
01:10:53,240 --> 01:10:59,953
her name still lingers
with adoration in my mind.

639
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:02,475
And what became of her?

640
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:07,637
She fell in love
with a stranger, a foreigner.

641
01:11:23,160 --> 01:11:24,833
She wanted to marry him.

642
01:11:26,720 --> 01:11:30,839
Such marriages were forbidden
in those families...

643
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:38,110
No one ever has known
where he came from.

644
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:42,920
He claimed to be a very holy person

645
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:48,840
and believed
that he was the avatar of Shiva.

646
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:57,437
He was a student of many religions.

647
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:05,040
It was rumored that
he frequently emulated and believed

648
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:10,674
that he possesses the powers
of the deities that he worshipped.

649
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:23,835
He lived in one of the nearby caves
and practiced his sorcery there.

650
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:25,995
In the caves?

651
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:30,072
Yes, in the caves.

652
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:37,197
When the knowledge of her lover
was known to her father

653
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:45,558
he forcefully tried to marry her
to another man from her own clan.

654
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:48,190
M y whole life,

655
01:12:48,280 --> 01:12:51,751
I have only honored you
and tried to fill you with pride.

656
01:12:51,880 --> 01:12:54,475
Pride! I am filled with disgust.

657
01:12:56,680 --> 01:12:58,751
M y love is a man you have never known.

658
01:12:58,840 --> 01:13:00,069
No more of this!

659
01:13:00,720 --> 01:13:03,952
Either you do exactly as I tell you

660
01:13:04,040 --> 01:13:06,396
and honor the tradition as a daughter

661
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:08,392
or I will hunt that pagan down

662
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:10,597
and send him to the fires of Narakha!

663
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:13,274
You know not what you say!

664
01:13:13,400 --> 01:13:14,356
Silence!

665
01:13:25,720 --> 01:13:26,551
No.

666
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:51,237
On the day it was announced
we were to be married...

667
01:13:51,640 --> 01:13:54,474
We? You were engaged to her?

668
01:13:54,760 --> 01:14:01,997
Yes. She was to be my bride,

669
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:06,872
but instead chose an immoral death...

670
01:14:07,680 --> 01:14:08,909
After she died,

671
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:16,440
the stranger killed her father
with one, quick blow...

672
01:14:32,840 --> 01:14:36,117
You have witnessed
the fall of this family.

673
01:14:38,360 --> 01:14:40,431
You have seen a god broken in two,

674
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:42,639
for this I curse you all.

675
01:14:44,840 --> 01:14:48,072
Every member of this wretched
family shall bear the pain

676
01:14:48,160 --> 01:14:49,719
that I feel this night

677
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:53,836
until my love returns to me
in the flesh.

678
01:14:58,720 --> 01:15:01,758
Family members began to die

679
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:04,795
by accidents

680
01:15:06,040 --> 01:15:08,032
mysterious diseases

681
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:18,873
but I was protected
from death by the deity

682
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:22,992
whom I have since served...

683
01:15:25,080 --> 01:15:29,154
Spared until the circle is closed

684
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:39,237
and I could hear her voice again...

685
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:44,759
How does the circle close?

686
01:15:45,640 --> 01:15:50,954
He who lives
by the sword must die by the sword,

687
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:56,033
baptized in fire which gave him life.

688
01:15:56,520 --> 01:15:57,670
The name?

689
01:15:57,880 --> 01:15:58,996
The girl that killed herself?

690
01:15:59,080 --> 01:16:00,639
Please tell us, what was her name?

691
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:04,677
Her name was...

692
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:13,070
You!

693
01:16:16,760 --> 01:16:17,671
Maya!

694
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:24,157
Maya!

695
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:54,391
The caves...

696
01:16:55,520 --> 01:16:56,397
the caves...

697
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:41,551
Mitra?

698
01:18:11,200 --> 01:18:13,510
Maya. M y sweet, beloved Maya.

699
01:18:13,880 --> 01:18:15,599
The night we shed our earthbound selves

700
01:18:15,680 --> 01:18:18,878
and become one forever
is finally come upon us.

701
01:18:19,680 --> 01:18:20,557
Are you ready?

702
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:22,110
Yes my love.

703
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:44,233
This has to be the way.

704
01:18:45,960 --> 01:18:46,837
I hope so.

705
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:50,760
Mitra, what are you doing?

706
01:18:59,040 --> 01:19:01,236
Mitra, what is the meaning of this?

707
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:05,195
You know why you are here.

708
01:19:05,640 --> 01:19:06,391
No.

709
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:08,719
You are the child beyond the oceans,

710
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:12,157
prophesied eons ago
to bring our souls together.

711
01:19:13,680 --> 01:19:17,117
You are the mirror image
of Aunt Maya, my lost love.

712
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:20,636
Aunt Maya?

713
01:19:22,200 --> 01:19:22,951
Me?

714
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:25,239
You share her destiny,

715
01:19:27,720 --> 01:19:29,996
and when we consummated
our love this day,

716
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:32,199
you and her became one.

717
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:36,074
I have returned to you.

718
01:19:37,680 --> 01:19:38,397
Yes.

719
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:40,751
Forever.

720
01:19:58,600 --> 01:20:02,276
No, I do not believe in past lives.

721
01:20:04,360 --> 01:20:05,271
If you love me,

722
01:20:05,360 --> 01:20:08,319
love me for who I am,
not who I represent.

723
01:20:09,520 --> 01:20:11,591
You do not represent. You are!

724
01:20:11,680 --> 01:20:13,831
No. I am only me.

725
01:20:14,040 --> 01:20:16,555
I will not let you do this again.

726
01:20:17,480 --> 01:20:20,234
You must trust me and believe.

727
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:23,472
I have only trusted you
and believed in us.

728
01:20:26,320 --> 01:20:27,800
Mitra, look at me.

729
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:32,713
The love we share is our own,
not some reflection of your past.

730
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:35,759
Please don't do this.

731
01:20:36,360 --> 01:20:37,680
I am sorry my love.

732
01:20:38,120 --> 01:20:39,600
This is the only way.

733
01:20:45,640 --> 01:20:46,710
Forgive me.

734
01:20:55,240 --> 01:20:56,959
By the stillness of the air,

735
01:20:57,760 --> 01:21:00,878
when you can only hear
the sound of your breath

736
01:21:01,240 --> 01:21:02,879
and the rhythm of your heartbeat,

737
01:21:03,880 --> 01:21:07,078
you will find the trail
that will lead you to them.

738
01:21:08,720 --> 01:21:09,676
This is a way.

739
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:13,715
Why? You taught me to love.

740
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:15,154
You taught me to feel.

741
01:21:15,480 --> 01:21:17,039
I gave you all of me.

742
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:20,877
You unlocked your own passions
and realized the truth.

743
01:21:37,040 --> 01:21:37,917
My love.

744
01:21:38,680 --> 01:21:41,434
Mitra, this is not the way.

745
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:43,752
No! This is our destiny!

746
01:21:44,360 --> 01:21:49,116
Our destiny is to be together,
for all eternity as ourselves.

747
01:21:50,280 --> 01:21:52,715
This child is not the vessel to that reality.

748
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:54,120
She is.

749
01:21:54,600 --> 01:21:57,195
She has her own destiny awaiting her.

750
01:21:58,800 --> 01:21:59,870
Too many

751
01:22:01,200 --> 01:22:04,750
too many perished
because of the wrongs done unto us.

752
01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:08,512
The suffering is over.

753
01:22:08,680 --> 01:22:12,151
How can you refuse
what we have dreamed of for so long.

754
01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:21,714
Ours is a tale of eternal longing
and desire.

755
01:22:23,480 --> 01:22:25,949
It should have ceased
with our natural deaths,

756
01:22:26,520 --> 01:22:28,352
not prolonged by your magic...

757
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:34,839
M y magic has kept our love alive,
all in anticipation of this moment.

758
01:22:58,440 --> 01:22:59,715
What are you doing?

759
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:21,194
Closing the circle.

760
01:23:21,560 --> 01:23:22,835
No!

761
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:45,231
Be with her now.
