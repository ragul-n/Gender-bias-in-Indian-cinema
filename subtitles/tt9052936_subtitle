1
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,680
- Don't kill us.
- Don't kill us..

2
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,840
Don't...

3
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,280
Let us go.

4
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,080
Hanif! Run away...

5
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,600
Someone, help!

6
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:07,280
Hanif Run away.
Run as fast as you can.

7
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,480
Run as fast as you can.

8
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,720
Run Hanif, run!

9
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,400
Catch him.

10
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,200
Run, Hanif.

11
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,480
Help!

12
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,960
Help!

13
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,080
Order, sir.

14
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,680
Lock and load.

15
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,920
Yeah...

16
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,240
'Sir, 24 bags were delivered
to this address.'

17
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,200
'We have found traces of 15 bags.'
Target is moving, sir.

18
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,720
- Yes, Husna.
- 'We found his home.'

19
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,960
Need to take the shot.

20
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,960
'According to these blueprints,
his bomb is sending a signal...'

21
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,680
- What?
- Order, sir.

22
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,880
Taking the shot.

23
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,480
Put everyone on high alert.

24
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:03,000
Check if check posts are doing okay.

25
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,000
I have put everyone on high alert.

26
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,160
Okay. Whatever are his instructions...

27
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,200
...we will have to follow them.

28
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,480
- Okay, sir.
- Come on.

29
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,240
Who is Warang?
Warang?

30
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,880
Sir, I am Warang.

31
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,160
The entire area is clear.

32
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,280
I spotted the boat.

33
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,320
- When did the boat arrive?
- I don't know.

34
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,280
So you are the Coast Guard,
but you have no clue...

35
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,360
...when the boat arrived.

36
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,920
Sir, I called it in as
soon as I spotted the boat.

37
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,720
I did my duty, madam.

38
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,760
The name of the boat, registration,
or who brought it here and when...

39
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,000
...you know nothing.

40
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,200
I mean...

41
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:38,720
More than half of this city's
security is posted at shores.

42
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,960
And still...

43
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:45,000
This is not duty,
it was carelessness on your part.

44
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,240
Rohit.

45
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,680
Look here.

46
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,240
- Sir this is...
- HMX.

47
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,120
Military grade.

48
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,560
Much more powerful than RDX.

49
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,640
How much do you think they smuggled in?

50
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,920
Judging by the size
of the compartment...

51
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,720
If they managed to
smuggle around 25-30 kilos...

52
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,920
...that would mean a thousand
or more people, at least.

53
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,320
Call sir.

54
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,400
Yes.

55
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,880
Yes, sir.

56
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,120
I know, but...

57
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,280
Yes, Sir.
I am with the ATS chief right now.

58
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,720
Yes.

59
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,560
How soon can
I get information from the IB?

60
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,920
Ma'am.

61
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,080
Okay. I am waiting.

62
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,440
Okay, thank you.

63
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,480
Ma'am, I'll take your leave.

64
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,200
Wait, Diwan.

65
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,240
IB will send us
information any minute.

66
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,520
Any minute?

67
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:04,040
25 kilos of HMX have
been smuggled in our city.

68
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,840
And we've no clue.

69
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:09,120
Maybe a day, five days, or even 10.

70
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,240
We don't know how many pieces
are already scattered around the city.

71
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,000
Every second is crucial
and you want a minute.

72
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:18,200
I understand, Diwan.
But we have to follow the procedures.

73
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,640
Home Minister.

74
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,720
Ma'am, you follow the procedure...

75
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,560
...and I'll do my duty.

76
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,360
Ronak?

77
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,120
- Yeah, Ronak.
- Sir, Mangesh Tawde, Narcotics.

78
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,120
Huh...

79
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,080
- Yes?
- Is Ronak your son?

80
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,000
Yes.

81
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,040
We conducted a raid
at the Blue Moon Hotel.

82
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,080
It was a rave party.

83
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,680
We also seized a large amount of drugs.

84
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,320
And took many youngsters in custody.

85
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,520
Your son was amongst them.

86
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,520
What do we do, sir?

87
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,000
You follow your procedure.

88
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,360
Shall we send all of
them for the drug test?

89
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,240
Obviously, all of them.

90
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,240
Yes, sir.

91
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,760
- Rautya.
- Yes, sir.

92
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,200
Take these two as well.
And hurry up.

93
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,080
Yes.

94
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,600
Let's go. Get up!

95
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,720
Ronak?

96
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,040
Sidhu.

97
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,560
I was waiting for Ronak.

98
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,880
Do you even know where your son is?

99
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,320
Yes, he's out partying with Ashish.

100
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,880
But he isn't answering my calls.

101
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,920
And he won't.

102
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,320
He was arrested in a Police raid.

103
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,440
They were in a rave party.

104
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,760
What?

105
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,440
How do you know?

106
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,120
They called me.

107
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,720
Oh my, God.

108
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,560
- Did you handle it, Sidhu?
- Yes.

109
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,720
They are taking him for a blood test.

110
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,280
Why didn't you stop them?

111
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,840
You should have brought him home.

112
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,040
We could have explained to him.

113
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,520
- Did you know he was doing drugs?
- No!

114
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,760
How...
How can he do drugs?

115
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,800
He's our son.

116
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,920
There must be some mistake.

117
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,640
If it's a mistake,
then he will come home.

118
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,160
Counter terror... But...

119
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,400
- Here are the names.
- What's the status?

120
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,840
- Any update?
- No, sir.

121
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,160
- Sir.
- OK sir.

122
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,400
- Sir.
- Sir.

123
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,440
Sir.

124
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,560
What about the CCTV Footage?

125
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,760
- Pass it to him.
- Yes.

126
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,760
- I want these three profiles, okay.
- Yes, ma'am.

127
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,720
Access CCTV footage.

128
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,840
Zoom in.

129
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,920
I don't have time. Hurry up.

130
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,200
What is this?

131
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,200
In the last two weeks...

132
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,360
Shirke, Diwan
sir is bringing the file, be ready.

133
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,440
Yes, sir.

134
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,080
- Come on, come on...
- Find it from this file.

135
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,040
- Yes, sir.
- Come on, guys. Fast.

136
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:08,040
"You are trapped in my iron grip.
And there is no way out."

137
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,560
"Let me tell you that
you're completely unaware..."

138
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,920
"...because no one's ever
escaped alive."

139
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,320
"You won't live to see the dawn."

140
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,800
"Better say your prayers now."

141
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:21,640
"I am going to kill you."

142
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,120
"Son... I don't give a warning."

143
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,240
"I don't give a warning."

144
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,400
"Hear the siren blaring aloud."

145
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,720
"There's a typhoon heading your way,
everyone clear-out."

146
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,160
"Bullet from my gun
or a hard right uppercut."

147
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,200
"Whatever you like..."

148
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,200
"...because we're going
to settle it once and for all."

149
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,640
"You think I am going easy on,
but this is a warning my son."

150
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,080
"Take this chance if you want,
because this is the last one."

151
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,440
"This is a race between
your life and my trigger..."

152
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,800
"...so do what you can."

153
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,280
"There's no second chance
when I deliver justice."

154
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,720
"Criminals drop dead,
end of chapter."

155
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,160
"Now that's my style,
I won't say no more."

156
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,520
"Be ready, son..."

157
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,520
"...I don't give a warning."

158
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:18,440
"You are trapped in my iron grip.
And there is no way out."

159
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,880
"Let me tell you that
you're completely unaware..."

160
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,280
"...because no one's
ever escaped alive."

161
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,640
"You won't live to see the dawn."

162
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,080
"Better say your prayers."

163
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:33,320
"I am gonna kill you."

164
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,320
"Son... I don't give a warning."

165
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,200
"I don't give a warning."

166
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,200
"I don't give a warning."

167
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,720
That one, please.

168
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,040
"I don't give a warning."
- Hey...

169
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,280
Hurry up.

170
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,800
- Easy, easy.
- Come on, come on.

171
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,840
- What's the report?
- He's an accident victim.

172
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,640
We've to stop the
bleeding immediately.

173
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,720
Nurse, prepare the stitches.

174
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,440
Could be a massive concussion.

175
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,440
Is there anyone from
the family accompanying him?

176
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,640
No, sir. The people present
at the site brought him in.

177
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,840
Get his ID from his wallet
and start the paperwork.

178
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,520
No wallet or phone.

179
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,880
What is your name?

180
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,160
Is there anyone we can call?

181
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,360
Can you hear me?

182
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,880
- Prepare a CT Scan.
- Yes, doctor.

183
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:05,960
What is this?

184
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,520
Nurse, scissors.

185
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,400
Hold.

186
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,160
What the hell.

187
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,280
Jai Hind, Sir.

188
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,760
Oh! Mr. Diwan.

189
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,520
You guys know the situation.

190
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:30,960
So why call me here?

191
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,200
We've some information, Diwan.

192
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,840
Couldn't be communicated
over the phone.

193
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
- Ma'am, Shinde.
- Yes.

194
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,280
We have found a suicide
bomber in Holy Spirit Hospital.

195
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,800
- He met with an accident.
- What?

196
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,320
Yes ma'am,
he's unconscious at the moment.

197
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,560
The entire hospital
wing has been evacuated.

198
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,920
- Okay, I'm sending a convoy.
- OK ma'am.

199
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,000
Take him to the Operation's
Base immediately.

200
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,520
- Yes.
- We are coming.

201
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,800
The Intelligence Base has been tracking
a man named Farooq Ali for two months.

202
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,680
We suspect he's a Sleeper Agent.

203
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:54,880
What?

204
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,000
And you're telling me this now?

205
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:57,960
Aren't we supposed
to be sharing information...

206
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,520
Sir, we have found a suicide bomber.

207
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,280
An accident victim was
brought in Holy Spirit Hospital.

208
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,920
And the Local Police claim
that there's a bomb on his chest.

209
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,280
- Rohit.
- Sir.

210
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,720
Follow up on Farooq Ali.

211
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,560
- IB has the information.
- Sir.

212
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,320
Hey! Open the door.

213
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,680
Open it!

214
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,240
Open the door, please!

215
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,600
Open the door, please!

216
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,440
Hmm.

217
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,640
Let me check.

218
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,080
Hey! Where do you think you're going?

219
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,400
- Hey, stop? huh?
- Listen to me.

220
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,000
Where?

221
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,600
Please. Listen to me.

222
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,360
Wait.

223
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,320
- Please listen to me, man.
- I said, stop.

224
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,920
Listen to me.

225
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,560
- Sir... There's a bomb on my...
- Stop.

226
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,560
- I said stop.
- Help me, sir.

227
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,480
Sir. Please.

228
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,680
Hey..

229
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,520
Hey, stop.

230
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,040
Stop.

231
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:26,800
Stop.

232
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,440
- Does everyone have the boy's picture?
- Yes, sir.

233
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,480
Comms check.

234
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,680
- Can you all hear me?
- Sir!

235
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:13,840
Disperse.

236
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,160
Where is room number 32?
- That way.

237
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,920
Who are you looking for?

238
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,920
Uh, Farooq.

239
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,240
He lives up there.
But he's not at home now.

240
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,440
Who are you?

241
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,000
I am his friend R... Riyaz.

242
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,160
When will he be back?

243
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,360
Haven't the slightest clue.

244
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,640
Must be out getting
some food or something.

245
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,280
I see...
See you then.

246
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,400
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

247
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:55,920
I found Farooq's place.

248
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,920
- Take your positions.
- Come on.

249
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,680
Farooq's not at home.
We'll have to wait for him.

250
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,240
What do you think?

251
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,120
Give me some time, sir.

252
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,760
I've never seen anything
like this before.

253
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,160
Sir. No ID, sir.

254
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,840
No phone, no wallet.

255
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,600
His fingerprints
are not on the record.

256
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,240
He's a professional.

257
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,760
Do as I say.

258
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,440
Go to the accident spot.

259
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,440
He has nothing on him.

260
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,760
Wouldn't have wandered too far,
on foot.

261
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,240
Sir.

262
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,160
Farooq.

263
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,360
- What?
- Someone came to see you.

264
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,480
Who?

265
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,520
Haven't the slightest clue.

266
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,440
The least you could've
done was ask his name.

267
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,720
Like a good neighbour.

268
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,440
I am not in charge of you.

269
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,560
Farooq.

270
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,200
His name was Riyaz.

271
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,920
Riyaz.

272
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,920
Gaitonde, Riyaz has arrived.

273
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,360
Maroon t-shirt,
and a shoulder over his bag.

274
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,080
Under any circumstance, do not shoot.

275
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,680
Let him go inside.
We'll nab him then.

276
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,320
Why is he coming back down?

277
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,560
I think he has seen me.

278
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,120
Move in. Move in. Move in.

279
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:45,920
Hey...

280
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,920
- Stop.
- Stop, you rascal.

281
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,520
Stop, you rascal.

282
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,960
- Stop.
- Stop.

283
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,240
Stop.

284
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,000
Hey... Farooq.

285
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,160
Move and you die.

286
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,360
Take it.

287
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,520
Do what you want, sir.

288
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,080
By my life rests in the hands of God.

289
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,720
I will rather die than say anything.

290
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,560
Doesn't matter.
We'll pry everything out of you.

291
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,040
Take him away.

292
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:25,920
Take him away.

293
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,240
Shut up.

294
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,200
- Take this to the bomb squad.
- Sir.

295
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,800
Search Farooq's house right now.

296
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,480
- Immediately.
- Sir.

297
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:57,040
Harish, can you get this out or not?

298
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,320
Sir, it's deeply
rooted inside his chest.

299
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,240
And this is filled with explosives.

300
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,960
And these electrodes are
directly connected to his heartbeat.

301
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,960
And the current generated from his
heartbeat is balancing this trigger.

302
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,920
Sum it up in one line.

303
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,960
His pulse is the bomb's battery.

304
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,320
If his heart stops beating,
the bomb will explode.

305
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,920
If he dies, or we take the bomb out,
it will still explode.

306
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,280
It's a deadman's switch.

307
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,560
But it didn't go
off during the accident.

308
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:24,000
Because HMX cannot be
triggered by force or by fire.

309
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:26,760
It needs an electric charge.

310
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,000
We've arrested Farooq.

311
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,280
I am sending him
to the safe house, now.

312
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:30,840
One more thing, sir.

313
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:33,360
We found a bomb in his bag as well.

314
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,200
Okay.

315
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,280
- We found another bomb.
- What?

316
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,080
Prepare him for the Narco test.

317
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:45,560
But sir, he's in terrible condition.

318
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,960
He's had a massive concussion.

319
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:50,560
He probably doesn't remember
anything due to the accident.

320
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,560
But the Narco test could be fatal.

321
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,600
He's right, sir.

322
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,200
Fine. Wake him up in 10 minutes.

323
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,880
I want to question him.

324
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,760
Okay, sir.

325
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:12,400
Today's story is dedicated
to my little angels.

326
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,160
So...

327
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:17,800
A little boy,
as old as our Rizwan here.

328
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:21,200
Was walking down the
path while rehearsing

329
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,400
the verses from the Holy Koran
and lost in his own thoughts.

330
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:28,000
When suddenly he realized
that he's come too far.

331
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:31,400
He found himself in the
middle of a dense forest...

332
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,360
...surrounded by only darkness.

333
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,360
Fear was evident on his face.

334
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:39,040
And his eyes welled up with tears.

335
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,680
Right before his tears
would trickle down on the ground...

336
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,680
...a huge hand came out of nowhere.

337
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:48,960
It had the brightest
tint of gold ever seen.

338
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,800
And as soon as the boy looked up...

339
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:59,600
...he noticed a big,
tall, genie standing in front.

340
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,360
In his bold voice, he said...

341
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,280
Come, my master.

342
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,160
I'll take you to an orchard...

343
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,800
..where candies grow
on trees like flowers.

344
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,720
Honey rains from the clouds.

345
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:16,320
Milk flows like a river. And
clouds are of the shape of balloons.

346
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:20,360
Would you like to go
to an orchard like that?

347
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,400
Yes.

348
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,240
Do you know where this orchard is?

349
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,520
In Paradise.

350
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:28,360
And the road to Paradise...

351
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,960
...leads through Tehreer-Al-Hind.

352
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,960
So the moral of today's story...

353
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,760
...Rizwan will tell all of you.

354
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:37,920
Rizwan.

355
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,400
So tell me, my son.

356
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,600
What do you want
to be when you grow up?

357
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,560
Mujahid!

358
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,680
What can you do for Tehreer-Al-Hind?

359
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,880
We shall sacrifice our
lives for Tehreer-Al-Hind.

360
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:55,920
But if our freedom is threatened...

361
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,800
...then we'll resort to Jihad.

362
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:00,840
Nothing can come
between Paradise and us.

363
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:03,240
- Nara-e-Takbir!
- Allah-hu-Akbar!

364
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:06,760
- Nara-e-Takbir!
- Allah-hu-Akbar!

365
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:09,640
My comrades, repeat after me.

366
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:13,600
Will you shed the blood
of infidels for your mission?

367
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,080
By the will of god!

368
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:17,520
Will you sacrifice your own lives?

369
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,960
By the will of God!

370
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,080
By the will of God!

371
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,560
By the will of God!

372
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,480
By the will of God!

373
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,200
By the will of God!

374
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:32,600
Brother, there's been
a situation in Mumbai.

375
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,680
The Grand Master wants
to have a word with you.

376
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,800
Greetings, sire.

377
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,720
Mumbai Police is on high alert.

378
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,200
This should've been all over by 9 am.

379
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,640
There has been a small glitch, sire.

380
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:55,040
But we'll take care of
it as soon as I reach Mumbai.

381
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,280
And it better be, Maqsood.

382
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,120
Our deal at stake.

383
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:02,480
The deal and Tehreer-al-Hind
will be a success, sire.

384
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:06,280
Please be patient,
like you always are.

385
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:10,240
Don't let my silence mislead you,
Maqsood.

386
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:13,800
Remember, IRP raised you from
the slums of Mumbai to the

387
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:16,240
messiah of Tehreer-al-Hind.

388
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,800
And if you fail, you'll be thrown
back into the gutters you came from.

389
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:24,120
I remember, sir. I very well do.

390
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:32,920
Just like IRP remembers
my role in winning Syria.

391
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,640
Can't look me in the eye?

392
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,600
Where am I?

393
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,800
Do you know what's on your chest?

394
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,240
Exactly what I've been asking.

395
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,080
What is this thing? Who put it there?

396
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,600
You are a suicide bomber.

397
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,800
Sui...

398
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,240
Sui... Suicide...

399
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,480
That's not possible, sir.

400
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:30,800
I don't know...

401
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,800
How many other suicide
bombers are out there?

402
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,240
What bombs?

403
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,600
How many other bombers are out there?

404
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:38,960
Sir, you're asking a question.
I know nothing about.

405
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,040
I haven't done anything.

406
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,680
One last time.

407
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,040
How many other bombers are out there?

408
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,040
You saw something.

409
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,960
Maybe a memory of some sort.

410
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,520
What was it?

411
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,440
I don't know, sir.

412
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,760
It's the same thing again and again.

413
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:26,840
What do you see?

414
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,920
Fire.

415
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,720
Did you start the fire?

416
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,320
I don't know.
But...

417
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,240
All I see is people are fighting.

418
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,640
Crying...

419
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:38,680
Dying...

420
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,000
Because of you?

421
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,480
I don't know, sir.

422
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,000
Where is it happening?

423
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,320
I don't know, sir.

424
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:51,840
I...

425
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,760
I can hear a voice saying...

426
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:59,240
- What voice?
- Run.

427
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,240
Run away...
'Run, Hanif.'

428
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:06,800
Hanif.

429
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:08,840
Hanif?

430
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,480
Is that your name?

431
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:16,880
My name is Hanif. Maybe.

432
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,080
Readings, please.

433
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:23,120
The polygraph readings are a match.

434
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,000
- What?
- He's telling the truth.

435
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,040
- Yeah...
- There's a small girl in Farooq's home.

436
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,560
What?

437
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,120
You know what, take her
to the Operation's Base as well.

438
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,240
And keep me updated.

439
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:00,360
Okay, sir.

440
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:16,920
- Shinde.
- Sir.

441
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,200
Farooq's bag must have a brand label.

442
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:21,760
Take a picture of it
and send it to me immediately.

443
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:41,160
"Welcome to Adventure Bags."

444
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:43,080
"Press One for Hindi..."

445
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:46,040
Sir, you've been questioning
me for two straight hours.

446
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:49,120
But honestly,
I don't remember a thing.

447
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,880
- Who is Farooq Ali?
- I don't know, sir.

448
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,920
You have a concussion on the head...

449
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,240
...and even the machine
says that you're not lying.

450
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:01,080
But people like you
are trained to deceive us...

451
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,200
Which training?

452
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,240
What training? What bomb?

453
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,080
I don't think I could
do something like this.

454
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,760
What do you mean by you can
never do something like this?

455
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:09,920
I don't know.

456
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:12,200
Maybe, it's my instincts.

457
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,880
This is instinct.

458
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,440
And this is training.

459
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,200
Received over a number of years.

460
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,040
Now, do you remember anything?

461
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:34,000
I told you everything I know.

462
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,680
According to you,
I was going to die anyway.

463
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,840
Feel free to do whatever
you like with me.

464
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,800
You're not afraid of dying?

465
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,280
Diwan, may I please see you.

466
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,040
Diwan, now.

467
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,840
May I have the room, please.

468
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:55,880
Yes, ma'am.

469
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,360
Yes, ma'am.

470
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,160
Take him out of the
city and finish him.

471
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,120
As you could see,
ma'am, I was getting through to him.

472
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:14,040
He's going to break.

473
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,600
We don't have the
luxury of time, Diwan.

474
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,720
He's a live bomb.

475
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,920
And this Department
is my responsibility.

476
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,800
You've arrested Farooq as well,
haven't you?

477
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:22,800
Extract information from him.

478
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:25,640
At least there is no
bomb strapped to his chest.

479
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:29,600
Okay, ma'am.
But I'll take him personally.

480
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:32,440
You don't have to, Diwan.
Diwan...

481
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:39,720
Come on.

482
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,960
- Have you seen this man?
- No, madam.

483
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,440
- Listen... Have you seen him?
- No, madam.

484
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,800
- No?
- No...

485
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,360
Mumbai Police, ATS.

486
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,560
I want information about this bag.

487
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:02,600
AB302.

488
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:03,960
I want every piece of detail you have.

489
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:04,880
Where it was delivered,

490
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,560
- Who made the delivery, everything.
- Yes, sir.

491
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,080
Come on.

492
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,520
Come on.

493
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:17,120
We had an order for
four different bags.

494
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,120
School bag, laptop bag, lunch bag...

495
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,160
Was it this man?

496
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:25,080
No, sir. He didn't pick up the bags.
My guy delivered the bags.

497
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:27,000
Chotu. You delivered these bags,
didn't you?

498
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:29,200
Yes, I've been there
a couple of times.

499
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:33,160
Sir, they ordered 4 different types
of bags, on 6 different occasions.

500
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:34,720
4 different types of bags,
on 6 occasions.

501
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:35,840
Adds up to 24 bags.

502
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,840
- Give me the receipt.
- Yes.

503
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,400
- Have you seen this man?
- No, I haven't.

504
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,280
No?

505
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,960
- Have you seen him?
- No, madam.

506
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,160
Have you seen him?

507
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,400
No, I haven't.

508
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:01,520
Mister, have you seen him?

509
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,160
No, madam.

510
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,280
Sir, Farooq's bag.

511
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,880
It's a mobile phone.

512
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,840
Meaning it can be remotely detonated.

513
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:21,720
You know what,
keep it in the bomb disposal van.

514
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:24,120
And take the van far away from Base.

515
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,920
This can be dangerous here.

516
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,400
- And be careful.
- Yes, sir.

517
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:30,880
Careful.

518
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:50,840
Sir, where are we going?

519
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,320
Do you remember anything?

520
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,760
- Where are we going, sir?
- Try to remember.

521
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:58,160
- First, tell me where are we going?
- To shoot you!

522
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:04,240
Hanif. Who is calling out your name?

523
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,960
How does it matter, sir?

524
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,560
I tried my best to remember.

525
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,360
Look at my condition.

526
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,720
What good will that do?

527
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:19,120
I want to know what's
in that head of yours?

528
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,800
I don't remember anything else.

529
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:27,400
I tried my best,
but that's all I could do.

530
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,040
Yeah, Rohit.

531
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,080
This area is very big.

532
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,080
I am trying.

533
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,240
I'll let you know if I find anything.

534
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:43,760
Okay.

535
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,560
Madam, Diwan sir has
taken him to the Salt pans.

536
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,040
Meaning end of story for him.

537
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,400
Okay, but we must find his house.

538
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,480
- Move.
- Okay.

539
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:59,880
Sir, Mangesh Tawde speaking.

540
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:02,320
- Yes.
- Your son's reports have arrived.

541
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:05,680
The tests are positive.

542
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,600
- Is he around?
- Yes, sir.

543
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,000
Give the phone to him.

544
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,080
Here, talk to him.

545
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:27,320
I am sorry, Dad.

546
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,360
Ronak.

547
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:31,600
Look, son.

548
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,480
Do exactly as they tell you.

549
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,200
I swear it was a mistake.

550
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,880
Just this one last time please.
Help me, please.

551
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,240
That's exactly what I am doing.

552
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,040
It will be good for you.

553
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:52,880
Dad...

554
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:14,040
Ronak? Is he your son?

555
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:16,800
Yes.

556
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:21,400
He's only a couple
of years younger to you.

557
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,560
Is he in trouble?

558
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,480
You'll handle it, sir.

559
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,320
Where is this address?

560
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,600
Okay.

561
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:04,960
Come on.

562
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:06,800
Come on.

563
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,800
This is the one.
Shinde.

564
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,000
Clear.

565
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,280
Someone move this desk quickly.

566
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,520
Order, sir.

567
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:13,920
Lock and load.

568
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:01,640
Dammit!

569
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:39,600
Yeah... - The delivery address is
a closed warehouse in Dharavi.

570
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:42,520
I think the entire
warehouse was emptied out.

571
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:45,120
And I also found traces of HMX.

572
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:48,240
Target is moving, sir.

573
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:50,920
24 bags were delivered
to this address.

574
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:55,360
Need to take the shot.

575
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,440
- Yeah, Husna.
- We found his home.

576
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:00,400
And there's a plethora of evidence.

577
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:04,240
Order, sir.

578
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:07,280
According to these blueprints,
his bomb is sending a signal...

579
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:09,440
...which connects with 24 other bombs.

580
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:11,480
All are wirelessly connected.

581
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:14,720
If he dies, then the other
24 bombs will also explode with him.

582
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:17,520
- What?
- Sir, Hanif is the trigger.

583
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:21,400
- Taking the shot.
- Hold it!

584
00:44:58,320 --> 00:44:59,320
Come on.

585
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:04,480
Come on.

586
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:10,000
Come on.

587
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:36,600
What did you tell the Police?

588
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,840
Speak up. What did you tell them?

589
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,880
What did you tell the Police?

590
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:48,920
Speak up.

591
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:56,640
Tie his hands in the front.

592
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:16,240
We need him alive.

593
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:01,360
Good.

594
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:06,920
You have not forgotten your teachings.

595
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:12,000
You have not forgotten your teachings.

596
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:19,120
You know me.
You're only unaware of who you are.

597
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:21,520
Don't worry, son.

598
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:24,120
You're back home.

599
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:25,680
Yes.

600
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:29,760
The apple of my eye. My son.

601
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:37,440
Enough.

602
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:41,440
It's okay, son. You're home now.

603
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:42,680
Enough.

604
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:44,280
Enough.

605
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:49,840
So Farooq... where are you from?

606
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:57,240
Speak up, Farooq.

607
00:50:57,840 --> 00:50:59,360
Where are you from?
Who are you working with?

608
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:00,800
Who is your leader?

609
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:02,000
Tell me.

610
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:07,080
It's turned off.
Now speak up.

611
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:19,120
Are you going to speak now?

612
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:26,080
You can strip my soul,
but I won't say a thing.

613
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:36,680
Speak up, Farooq. Come on.

614
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:39,000
It's going to be very painful.

615
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:39,960
Come on.

616
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:41,760
Come on.

617
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:46,040
Okay, fine.

618
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:53,000
Do you know, why everyone
wears a ring on this finger?

619
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:54,120
Do you?

620
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:57,000
Because the vein in this finger

621
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:02,520
connects straight to the heart.

622
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:07,560
If you don't speak up...

623
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:11,440
...the bag with the bomb
will be delivered to Hyderabad.

624
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:14,200
Your parents live there, don't they?

625
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:17,760
Yes.

626
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:20,600
I'll tell you, sir.

627
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:23,080
Come on. Okay, fine. Tell me.

628
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:26,840
- You have my daughter, don't you?
- Yes.

629
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:30,200
Take her to Hyderabad as well.

630
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:33,760
So we can all go to Paradise together.

631
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:52,640
No, no, no, Aruna.
This is not done.

632
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:56,120
How could you take such a
big decision without consulting me?

633
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:57,640
Sir, he's a live bomb.

634
00:52:58,080 --> 00:52:59,600
This was the only decision.

635
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:00,920
Only decision?

636
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:04,600
An army of terrorists is trotting
through the city with a live bomb.

637
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:06,760
Neither you nor Diwan could stop them.

638
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:10,000
The attack was sudden.
Maybe they were tracking the boy.

639
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:13,320
Or maybe they have
an informant on your team.

640
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:15,720
Sir, I trust the ATS.

641
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:18,080
But if there's one,
then Diwan will find the leak.

642
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:19,120
He better.

643
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:28,760
Pick up.

644
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:38,400
Sir.

645
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:53,120
Rohit.

646
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:58,120
I want everyone's cellphone tapped,
including mine.

647
00:53:58,360 --> 00:53:59,800
But, sir...

648
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:02,800
I beat the hell out of Farooq
but he wouldn't talk.

649
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:04,360
He will talk!

650
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:10,640
Prepare him for the Narco Test.

651
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:22,480
Sir. We finally have a breakthrough.

652
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:25,080
We've ID'd the terrorists
that died in the shootout.

653
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:26,560
They all belong to
different nationalities.

654
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:29,480
Uzbeki, Iranian, Chinese.
It's a fairly new organization.

655
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:30,640
Tehreer-Al-Hind!

656
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:34,040
RAW has sent these photos.

657
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:37,720
His name is Maqsood-Al-Mugasil.

658
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:39,200
Thanks to the funding from IRP...

659
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:41,240
...he's on his way to becoming the
head of a new terrorist organization.

660
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:44,000
He's no leader, just a bloody goon.

661
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:46,600
Many years ago,

662
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:49,560
he used to illegally seize
plots for politicians and Builders.

663
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:53,200
Has there been any more sighting?
- Yes, sir.

664
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:55,840
According to RAW, he's been
sighted twice in four months.

665
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:57,880
Robat Karim and Pokhara, Nepal.

666
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:02,520
Meaning now he's in Mumbai.

667
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:50,000
Your favourite.

668
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,200
Who...

669
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:00,800
- What is...
- Calm down.

670
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:02,000
Calm down.

671
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:05,200
You will get all your
answers in due time.

672
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:39,400
Who are you?

673
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:43,880
Who are you?

674
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:45,800
Hanif.

675
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:47,120
Who told you that?

676
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:48,400
The Police?

677
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:50,840
I remember.

678
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:52,840
How?
You've lost your memory.

679
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:54,680
Not everything...

680
00:56:57,120 --> 00:57:00,480
Just the voice...

681
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:02,240
Whose voice?

682
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:06,840
Whose voice?

683
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:10,520
I don't know.

684
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:13,320
But you do. You cannot forget it.

685
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:19,360
Your desire to attain Paradise
won't let you forget your purpose.

686
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:20,800
Remember...

687
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:23,120
Whose voice is it?

688
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:24,320
Whose voice?

689
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:26,120
- 'Hanif!'
- Who is that?

690
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:27,760
Who are you?

691
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:33,600
Kill them.

692
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:42,200
Hello. Hello.
Hello, Police Station.

693
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:43,640
- What is it?
- Hello.

694
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:45,560
- I am calling from Sewri Chawl...
- Father...

695
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:46,520
- Hello.
- Hello.

696
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:48,280
- Hello!
- Come on.

697
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:51,400
Catch him.

698
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:52,920
Come on.

699
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:54,920
But a riot has broken
out in Sewri Chawl.

700
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:56,360
They set our homes on fire.

701
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:58,280
We're on our way.
But it will take some time.

702
00:57:58,360 --> 00:57:59,200
Hello.

703
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:00,520
- Father, let's go.
- But when?

704
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:02,080
There's no one out here.

705
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:09,960
- Father, I am scared.
- Wait...

706
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:11,200
Father, let's go.

707
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:13,080
Father, let's go.

708
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:14,120
Father...

709
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:16,520
Keep pressing this redial
button over and over again.

710
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:18,400
- I'll be right back.
- Where are you going, father?

711
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:19,720
- Keep trying, son. I'll be right back.
- Father?

712
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:21,640
Keep trying. I am coming.

713
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:31,360
Hanif! Run away, son.

714
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:33,120
Run away I said.

715
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:35,520
Run as fast as you can.

716
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:37,320
As fast as you can.

717
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:38,600
Run away, Hanif.

718
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:39,800
Run!

719
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:42,520
This is wrong.

720
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:44,840
Father.

721
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:57,360
Burn down every house.

722
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:59,200
Empty everything.

723
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:03,240
But no one came to your rescue.

724
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:06,640
Police and Criminals are all the same.

725
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:11,000
That was your beginning.

726
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:13,120
Father!

727
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:14,800
Try to remember.

728
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:17,440
This was your plan.

729
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:20,960
When you came to me.

730
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:27,960
You have not forgotten your teachings.

731
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:32,960
Did you succeed in your endeavour?

732
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:44,960
I will personally make all
the bombs for the sleeper cells.

733
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:49,000
They will all be wirelessly connected,
and there will be only one trigger.

734
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:51,440
Me.

735
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:54,960
We have 24 Sleeper Cells in Mumbai.

736
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:56,480
For the first time...

737
00:59:57,240 --> 01:00:02,400
...24 simultaneous blasts
in the history of India.

738
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:04,160
No.

739
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:07,880
As soon as I remove
this bomb from my chest...

740
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:09,640
...in 10 seconds.

741
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:12,680
25 blasts, not 24.

742
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:18,920
We shall shake India from its core.

743
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:21,560
Because now it's your turn.

744
01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:41,000
- Do you know how to play X and 0?
- Hmm.

745
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:54,200
Wow. You are really good at this.

746
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:57,200
One more?

747
01:00:57,280 --> 01:00:58,760
Where is my father?

748
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:05,360
If you win the next two games,
then we'll call him.

749
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:06,600
Okay.

750
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:27,160
What is your name?

751
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:30,840
Farooq.

752
01:01:31,240 --> 01:01:32,520
Farooq.

753
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:34,280
What is your full name?

754
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:35,520
Fa...

755
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:37,880
Farooq Ali Khan.

756
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:39,560
Farooq Ali Khan.

757
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:42,040
Where do you work?

758
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:44,600
AC Repairing.

759
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:49,440
A-Class Service. Door-to-Door.

760
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:52,800
A-Class Service. Door-to-Door.

761
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:55,280
What is the name of your handler?

762
01:01:57,400 --> 01:01:59,040
What's the matter, Farooq?

763
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:01,960
It's forbidden to take his name.

764
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:06,560
Whose name is forbidden?

765
01:02:06,680 --> 01:02:08,440
Rafiq.

766
01:02:08,680 --> 01:02:10,240
Rafiq.

767
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:12,040
Rafiq.

768
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:15,360
What is Rafiq's full name?

769
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:16,840
Rafiq.

770
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:22,440
Rafiq Mohammad Ghani.

771
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:26,880
You know what,
let's play a different game.

772
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:28,520
This is a pretty simple game.

773
01:02:28,600 --> 01:02:29,400
We'll start with a question...

774
01:02:29,480 --> 01:02:32,240
...first I'll give the answers,
and then you. okay.

775
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:34,240
Like...

776
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:37,960
This bag.
My aunt gave me this bag.

777
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:39,560
And...

778
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:45,880
Dad's friend gave him this bag.

779
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:47,800
Very good.

780
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:51,720
My aunt gave me this bag last year,
at her home.

781
01:02:52,360 --> 01:02:57,640
Dad's friend gave him this
bag yesterday, at the carnival.

782
01:02:57,800 --> 01:02:58,880
Very good.

783
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:02,320
This is my aunt.

784
01:03:13,720 --> 01:03:15,240
Farooq.

785
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,800
What is your target?

786
01:03:20,560 --> 01:03:22,320
I don't know.

787
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:25,760
How many more are out there?

788
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:28,080
I don't know.

789
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:29,880
Where does Rafiq live?

790
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:32,840
No one knows.

791
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:39,160
Where does he work?

792
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:48,000
Grant Road, Old Mills.

793
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:51,320
Grant Road, Old Mills.

794
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:53,720
Old Mills...

795
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:16,480
Let's go.

796
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:29,840
Hello.

797
01:04:30,440 --> 01:04:32,360
I Hope your son's okay, Mr. Diwan.

798
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:40,640
You should take care of him.

799
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:44,160
Otherwise goods kids like turn
into bad kids like me.

800
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:46,040
So you remember everything now...

801
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:48,040
...or never forgot anything
in the first place.

802
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:50,280
You're the one forgetting, Mr. Diwan.

803
01:04:50,360 --> 01:04:51,880
So I thought I should jog your memory.

804
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:53,160
What?

805
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:56,160
24 bombs, which are connected to you.

806
01:04:56,240 --> 01:04:57,400
Enough.

807
01:04:57,760 --> 01:04:58,960
Now I have a question to ask you.

808
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:05,120
Why didn't you answer
your phone that night?

809
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:06,400
What?

810
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:09,360
Sewri Chawl, 2002.

811
01:05:11,080 --> 01:05:13,120
Why didn't you answer your phone?

812
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:21,360
- 'Doctor...
- Mr. Diwan, we're trying our best.'

813
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:22,760
'Don't worry.'

814
01:05:45,120 --> 01:05:46,840
'Congratulations, it's a boy.'

815
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:48,520
- 'They both are fine.
- Thank you, doctor.'

816
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:49,880
You can go inside."

817
01:05:51,040 --> 01:05:53,840
'Keep trying, son. I'll be right back.'

818
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:56,000
'Diwan sir will definitely
come to our rescue.'

819
01:05:56,080 --> 01:05:58,480
- 'Keep trying. I am coming.
- Yes.'

820
01:06:02,920 --> 01:06:04,960
But no one came to your rescue.

821
01:06:08,320 --> 01:06:09,560
It was all over.

822
01:06:10,560 --> 01:06:12,400
I didn't have my phone.

823
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:15,520
I didn't have my phone.

824
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:16,800
I know.

825
01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:21,240
I know that when you were
welcoming a new member to you family...

826
01:06:22,080 --> 01:06:23,520
...we lost everyone we had.

827
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:27,240
And the Police made
good of this incident.

828
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:28,480
Your fight is with me.

829
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,480
So come fight me.
Why target innocent people?

830
01:06:31,560 --> 01:06:33,360
Even my father was an innocent man.

831
01:06:33,880 --> 01:06:35,960
He was an informer
for the Police, and you...

832
01:06:36,560 --> 01:06:39,320
...but you let him die.

833
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:42,680
But now it's the System's turn to burn.

834
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:47,880
I've been fighting against this system
and criminals like you for 30 years.

835
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:50,640
And I am still standing my ground.

836
01:06:53,880 --> 01:06:56,800
Then today, I will teach you to kneel.

837
01:06:58,400 --> 01:06:59,600
Goodbye.

838
01:07:06,560 --> 01:07:08,400
Sir, he's bouncing the signal all over.

839
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:10,240
We can't pinpoint his location.

840
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:42,840
The bomb's activated meaning
Hanif is testing the signal.

841
01:07:43,040 --> 01:07:44,000
Yes, sir.

842
01:07:51,080 --> 01:07:52,560
Mohit, check the signal frequency.

843
01:07:52,680 --> 01:07:54,120
- Quick.
- Yes, sir.

844
01:08:24,320 --> 01:08:25,960
Sir, got the signal.

845
01:08:26,040 --> 01:08:27,560
Lock it. Lock it.

846
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:29,640
Locked.

847
01:08:46,160 --> 01:08:47,280
Let's go.

848
01:09:05,320 --> 01:09:06,560
Now we're safe.

849
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:09,360
All the bombs have been activated...

850
01:09:09,440 --> 01:09:11,600
...and I've also sent everyone
their train tickets.

851
01:09:11,960 --> 01:09:13,120
Except for one.

852
01:09:14,240 --> 01:09:15,520
Sleeper Cell no. 18.

853
01:09:15,720 --> 01:09:17,000
I cannot activate his bomb.

854
01:09:17,280 --> 01:09:18,400
Farooq Ali.

855
01:09:18,680 --> 01:09:19,720
He's in Police custody.

856
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:22,480
Maybe the Police have diffused his bomb.

857
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:23,520
What if he reveals the plan?

858
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:26,440
No need to worry.
He has no information...

859
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:29,840
...but his handler Rafiq,
he knows too much.

860
01:09:30,360 --> 01:09:33,360
- If the Police get to him...
- Don't worry.

861
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:38,240
I'll handle him.

862
01:09:38,720 --> 01:09:40,560
Then tonight at 12 o'clock.

863
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:43,080
With 24 blasts in 24 trains...

864
01:09:44,120 --> 01:09:46,960
...India will come face to
face with the morbid reality.

865
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:48,520
So be it.

866
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:51,240
I wish...

867
01:09:52,520 --> 01:09:58,000
I wish we could pray
together one last time.

868
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:08,800
Now I'll say my prayers in Paradise.

869
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:14,400
Go on my son.

870
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:16,440
May success be with you.

871
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:34,040
Yeah, Harish.

872
01:10:34,240 --> 01:10:35,680
We've diffused Farooq's bomb.

873
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:37,720
And also locked in on
the signal of Hanif's bomb.

874
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:41,200
It's crucial that Hanif
stays in the Operations Base.

875
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:43,000
It's the only place
where we can jam his signal.

876
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:44,840
Now we can diffuse all the bombs.

877
01:10:44,920 --> 01:10:47,080
Okay, Harish. Well done.

878
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:01,680
Greetings.

879
01:11:22,680 --> 01:11:24,120
Rafiq.

880
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:28,920
And who are you?

881
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:30,520
Brother Bashir has sent me.

882
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:35,480
Brother Bashir sent you?

883
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:37,840
Let me speak to him.

884
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:38,960
We don't have the time.

885
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:40,120
Farooq Ali has been arrested.

886
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:41,720
We must get out of here right now.

887
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:42,960
Farooq's been arrested?

888
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:44,360
- Do you have a bag?
- Hmm.

889
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:50,600
When was he arrested?

890
01:11:50,680 --> 01:11:52,520
I don't know. But we must
get out of here as soon as we can.

891
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:53,800
Keep this.

892
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:55,920
This too.

893
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,600
Sh***! Hanif!

894
01:12:03,680 --> 01:12:04,880
Rafiq!

895
01:12:07,160 --> 01:12:08,320
Hanif!

896
01:12:12,280 --> 01:12:13,960
Hey, stop.

897
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:54,840
Magnam Tours and Travels.

898
01:13:55,040 --> 01:13:56,040
This is Rafiq Ghani's ticket.

899
01:13:56,320 --> 01:13:57,280
From Ratnagiri to Mumbai.

900
01:13:57,920 --> 01:13:59,160
Magnam...

901
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:01,640
Magnam Tours and Travels.

902
01:14:02,160 --> 01:14:03,080
- Does this name ring a bell?
- Yes.

903
01:14:03,160 --> 01:14:06,800
The terrorist's vehicle we found at the
salt pans was registered to this name.

904
01:14:08,160 --> 01:14:10,120
You go give this evidence to sir.
I'll go check out this place.

905
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:11,280
Hmm.

906
01:14:46,240 --> 01:14:47,800
Scan all these documents.

907
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:50,200
And cross-check them with
all the names on our database.

908
01:14:50,280 --> 01:14:51,480
Yes.

909
01:14:53,160 --> 01:14:54,760
Ali. Hard drive.

910
01:14:55,040 --> 01:14:56,280
Check what's on it.

911
01:15:04,160 --> 01:15:05,320
Up there.

912
01:15:14,360 --> 01:15:15,400
Magnam.

913
01:15:34,720 --> 01:15:36,480
- Hello.
- Hello.

914
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:39,560
Can I get a good
package for North India?

915
01:15:39,640 --> 01:15:40,920
Of course.

916
01:15:45,720 --> 01:15:46,720
Here you go.

917
01:15:52,280 --> 01:15:53,320
Goodbye.

918
01:16:15,160 --> 01:16:16,400
Say Bashir.

919
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:21,240
Brother. If the transfer's done,
then you must leave immediately.

920
01:16:21,720 --> 01:16:23,160
The Police are on high alert.

921
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:26,520
The money's been transferred,
and that was important.

922
01:16:27,200 --> 01:16:32,200
Bashir, I'm waiting for our
organization to come in the limelight.

923
01:16:33,320 --> 01:16:35,920
Let the Flag of
Tehreer-Al-Hind's flag soar high.

924
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:38,720
This city has a habit.

925
01:16:39,240 --> 01:16:42,400
Bomb's go off, people die.

926
01:16:43,160 --> 01:16:46,240
Debates on TV, candle marches, and
then the security mellows down again...

927
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:49,640
...and everyone gets
busy with their own life.

928
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:52,880
Then we can leave without any worries.

929
01:16:54,240 --> 01:17:00,000
Because this city's
nature is Everything goes.

930
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:04,640
He's a live bomb,
we can't take any chance.

931
01:17:04,760 --> 01:17:06,920
Sir, we found a hard
drive from Rafiq's bag.

932
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:08,560
One name keeps surfacing
again and again.

933
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:09,800
Magnam Corporation.

934
01:17:10,480 --> 01:17:12,800
Registered address
is a small travel agency.

935
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:14,640
Their overseas account
runs into millions...

936
01:17:14,720 --> 01:17:17,280
...while their office
space is hardly 100 Sq. ft.

937
01:17:18,520 --> 01:17:20,320
Sir, look at this map.

938
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:22,640
It's some place in Mumbai,
but looks really very old.

939
01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:24,200
The map dates back to 1935...

940
01:17:24,280 --> 01:17:27,040
...but it's hard to decipher
what exactly the map is of.

941
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:38,040
And this one?

942
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:40,680
Yeah...

943
01:17:40,760 --> 01:17:42,840
Sir, I am right outside the shop.

944
01:17:42,920 --> 01:17:45,640
There's hardly any space for a couple
of people to stand comfortably...

945
01:17:45,720 --> 01:17:48,400
...but I just saw a
dozen people coming out.

946
01:17:48,720 --> 01:17:52,360
I am sure, there must be
a secret passageway behind the shop.

947
01:17:59,720 --> 01:18:01,000
Not behind it.

948
01:18:01,640 --> 01:18:02,880
Under it.

949
01:18:16,880 --> 01:18:20,240
"Look him straight in the eye."

950
01:18:20,320 --> 01:18:23,600
"Make him stop breathing."

951
01:18:23,680 --> 01:18:27,080
"Zest and enthusiasm
are a lethal combination."

952
01:18:27,160 --> 01:18:31,080
"Can raze the enemy to the ground."

953
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:37,320
"Show some courage and move ahead."

954
01:18:37,400 --> 01:18:41,320
"Do what nobody can."

955
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:52,240
"Stop this cat and mouse game,
because you're a lion."

956
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:54,320
"What's going to happen to you."

957
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:57,800
"We'll sever 100 heads
for each life we lose."

958
01:18:57,880 --> 01:19:01,240
"We promise to strip
your skin off your bones."

959
01:19:01,320 --> 01:19:04,520
"You're going to pay
for your insolence."

960
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:08,000
"Be ready to mourn over your death."

961
01:19:08,080 --> 01:19:11,400
"We'll give a fitting reply each time."

962
01:19:11,480 --> 01:19:15,760
"We'll turn you to ashes."

963
01:19:20,040 --> 01:19:23,440
"Show some courage and move ahead."

964
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:26,760
"Do what nobody can."

965
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:30,320
"Show some courage and move ahead."

966
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:35,080
"Do what nobody can."

967
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:53,000
- Ali, good to go.
- Copy.

968
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:05,080
Waiting on your orders, sir.

969
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:07,480
Are we safe to go?

970
01:20:07,560 --> 01:20:08,680
One second, sir.

971
01:20:12,200 --> 01:20:13,680
The shop's cameras have been hacked.

972
01:20:14,040 --> 01:20:15,760
Sir, clear to go.

973
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:18,840
- Copy.
- Move.

974
01:20:43,080 --> 01:20:44,280
Yes.

975
01:20:46,520 --> 01:20:47,560
What?

976
01:20:50,360 --> 01:20:52,760
Brother. The Police have us surrounded.

977
01:21:07,720 --> 01:21:10,200
They are coming in through the garage.

978
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:12,800
But the shop's entry looks clear.

979
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:14,120
I think we should go through there.

980
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:16,440
Then leave everything and let's go.

981
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:17,840
Come on.

982
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:41,800
Hold.

983
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:44,400
Come on.

984
01:21:46,640 --> 01:21:47,480
Hold.

985
01:21:54,520 --> 01:21:57,040
- Come back.
- Come back down, brother.

986
01:22:27,240 --> 01:22:28,200
Check your phone.

987
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:33,400
There's no network.

988
01:22:48,240 --> 01:22:50,160
They have jammed the network.

989
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:53,760
Don't worry, I'll do something.

990
01:26:00,720 --> 01:26:02,760
Hey... Stop.

991
01:26:04,120 --> 01:26:05,480
Stay back or I will shoot.

992
01:26:06,960 --> 01:26:08,840
Stay back or I will shoot.

993
01:26:11,680 --> 01:26:13,760
Take the children to safety.
Take the children to safety.

994
01:26:16,200 --> 01:26:17,560
Stop!

995
01:26:25,840 --> 01:26:28,120
Cover the children!

996
01:27:40,160 --> 01:27:42,440
I heard you were
an expert in your job.

997
01:27:42,640 --> 01:27:44,400
But now I've seen it myself.

998
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:47,120
Consider yourself lucky, Mr. SS Diwan.

999
01:27:47,480 --> 01:27:50,920
Because no ordinary
man gets to be face-to-face...

1000
01:27:50,960 --> 01:27:55,720
...with Maqsood-Al-Mugasil,
the soldier of Tehreer-Al-Hind.

1001
01:27:56,560 --> 01:27:57,920
You're a dealer.

1002
01:27:59,560 --> 01:28:03,880
A dealer thriving at the mercy
of politicians and builders.

1003
01:28:03,960 --> 01:28:05,680
How does it matter?

1004
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:10,440
Everything in this materialistic
world is for sale, Mr. Diwan.

1005
01:28:11,200 --> 01:28:16,480
Faith, honesty,
every relationship, every profession.

1006
01:28:16,720 --> 01:28:18,720
Even the country and patriotism.

1007
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:21,920
The nation,
its ruler and even the system.

1008
01:28:22,640 --> 01:28:24,680
This is just plain business.

1009
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:30,640
What about these reputed
hospitals and medical companies.

1010
01:28:32,640 --> 01:28:34,040
They bank on your fear of falling sick

1011
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:36,800
or dying. And feed off of it.

1012
01:28:37,680 --> 01:28:39,520
They do it in the name of science...

1013
01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:41,720
...and we do it in the name of Religion.

1014
01:28:42,760 --> 01:28:47,680
It's... Just plain business.

1015
01:28:48,360 --> 01:28:50,360
And I've come to shut down
that business.

1016
01:28:50,600 --> 01:28:51,840
What's the point?

1017
01:28:53,440 --> 01:28:55,360
It will all be over at 12 o'clock.

1018
01:28:56,680 --> 01:28:57,840
How?

1019
01:28:58,880 --> 01:28:59,800
Hanif?

1020
01:29:02,640 --> 01:29:03,960
He's rotting in prison.

1021
01:29:13,560 --> 01:29:15,360
What is the most you can do?

1022
01:29:15,440 --> 01:29:16,600
Arrest me.

1023
01:29:43,840 --> 01:29:48,520
"We may be tired."

1024
01:29:48,640 --> 01:29:53,160
"...but haven't lost hope."

1025
01:29:53,320 --> 01:29:57,720
"The night will pass..."

1026
01:29:57,800 --> 01:30:01,640
"...and the dawn shall rise again."

1027
01:30:02,280 --> 01:30:07,080
Every perspective says that

1028
01:30:07,240 --> 01:30:11,160
Why do you tolerate injustice?

1029
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:15,440
"I am obsessed."

1030
01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:18,800
"Make your own destiny."

1031
01:30:18,880 --> 01:30:23,280
"There's a fire left inside you."

1032
01:30:25,200 --> 01:30:29,440
"Make the sky bow at your feet."

1033
01:30:29,520 --> 01:30:32,480
"Make the earth shake
to your footsteps."

1034
01:30:32,600 --> 01:30:39,560
"There's a fire left inside you."

1035
01:30:49,640 --> 01:30:52,040
- Where is Hanif?
- They took him to you.

1036
01:30:52,120 --> 01:30:53,400
On whose orders?

1037
01:30:53,520 --> 01:30:55,320
I was told they were your orders, sir.

1038
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:19,680
'Father.'

1039
01:31:59,240 --> 01:32:00,400
For father.

1040
01:32:05,680 --> 01:32:06,920
For father!

1041
01:33:38,160 --> 01:33:39,760
Forget your bag and leave now.

1042
01:33:39,880 --> 01:33:41,160
Evacuate this compartment right now.

1043
01:33:41,240 --> 01:33:43,480
Come on. Keep moving.
Now.

1044
01:33:51,960 --> 01:33:53,440
Stop. Hold on.

1045
01:33:53,560 --> 01:33:54,680
- Hold on. Stop.
- What is happening?

1046
01:33:54,760 --> 01:33:56,520
Stop.
Why are we all together?

1047
01:33:56,600 --> 01:33:58,800
- Hold on.
- Stop. Stay where you are.

1048
01:33:58,880 --> 01:34:01,960
There's been a mistake.
There's been a mistake.

1049
01:34:02,040 --> 01:34:04,520
Stay where you are.

1050
01:34:05,800 --> 01:34:07,360
Everyone stand right there.

1051
01:34:08,160 --> 01:34:09,800
No, no one will make a move.

1052
01:34:42,240 --> 01:34:47,160
A huge explosion took place in the
train heading from Mumbai to Ahmedabad.

1053
01:34:47,400 --> 01:34:50,880
According to our sources,
20-25 people are feared to be dead.

1054
01:34:50,960 --> 01:34:54,800
Who is responsible for this blast, and
what was the motive behind this attack

1055
01:34:54,920 --> 01:34:58,400
are some of the questions
the ATS are yet to answer.

1056
01:34:58,640 --> 01:35:02,920
We're all waiting for a
statement from ATS Chief SS Diwan.

1057
01:35:14,280 --> 01:35:17,120
Sir, they are calling you.

1058
01:35:25,040 --> 01:35:27,120
Sir, the explosion occurred
in Compartment no. 10.

1059
01:35:27,360 --> 01:35:28,760
The compartment in front
of it was empty.

1060
01:35:29,080 --> 01:35:31,680
But, the main compartment
and the luggage compartment

1061
01:35:31,920 --> 01:35:33,520
have suffered severe

1062
01:35:33,920 --> 01:35:35,120
How many were in the compartment?

1063
01:35:35,280 --> 01:35:38,240
According to the railway manifest,
there were 24 people onboard.

1064
01:35:39,120 --> 01:35:41,040
But we've recovered only 23 bodies.

1065
01:35:41,160 --> 01:35:42,720
Sir. Look.

1066
01:35:42,920 --> 01:35:45,920
This bomb is exactly like
the one we found in Farooq's bag.

1067
01:35:46,120 --> 01:35:47,680
And looking at the
intensity of the blast...

1068
01:35:47,800 --> 01:35:49,800
...I presume there
were at least 4-5 bomb blasts.

1069
01:35:49,960 --> 01:35:53,000
We have also found
19-20 charred bomb parts.

1070
01:35:53,280 --> 01:35:55,760
I think they were all travelling
in the same compartment.

1071
01:35:58,040 --> 01:36:01,600
Some of the passengers claim that a lady
officer evacuated the front compartments.

1072
01:36:02,960 --> 01:36:05,240
We're trying to find out who she is.

1073
01:36:05,960 --> 01:36:06,920
Husna.

1074
01:36:08,160 --> 01:36:11,040
- Where is Hanif?
- They were bringing him to you.

1075
01:36:11,320 --> 01:36:13,480
They have an informant on your team.

1076
01:36:13,560 --> 01:36:15,280
'Diwan sir took him to the salt pans.'

1077
01:36:15,400 --> 01:36:16,640
'Meaning game over.'

1078
01:36:17,560 --> 01:36:20,040
'Brother Bashir,
they are taking him to the Salt Pans.'

1079
01:36:20,640 --> 01:36:24,040
'If he dies, 24 other bombs
will explode simultaneously.'

1080
01:36:24,160 --> 01:36:27,400
'Sir, Don't shoot...
Hanif is the trigger.'

1081
01:36:34,280 --> 01:36:35,240
Speak.

1082
01:36:35,320 --> 01:36:36,880
I apologize, sir.

1083
01:36:37,280 --> 01:36:39,000
But in order to achieve some goals...

1084
01:36:39,080 --> 01:36:41,280
...the righteous have
to be kept in the dark.

1085
01:36:41,440 --> 01:36:43,040
Your apology won't change anything.

1086
01:36:43,800 --> 01:36:46,440
What you did was wrong.

1087
01:36:47,800 --> 01:36:50,680
But if you had done it,
it would've become right.

1088
01:36:50,960 --> 01:36:51,960
Wouldn't it?

1089
01:36:52,520 --> 01:36:54,040
Look, Diwan sir.

1090
01:36:54,280 --> 01:36:57,720
I am not a protector like
you or a terrorist like them.

1091
01:36:58,200 --> 01:37:00,120
I am the fine line that
exists between the two.

1092
01:37:00,400 --> 01:37:01,920
Forcing Maqsood to come to Mumbai...

1093
01:37:01,960 --> 01:37:04,480
...and telling you about
his hideout was necessary.

1094
01:37:04,760 --> 01:37:07,600
Whatever I did,
it was all part of my plan.

1095
01:37:10,520 --> 01:37:12,480
'Honestly, I don't remember a thing.'

1096
01:37:12,520 --> 01:37:13,720
'You know who I am...'

1097
01:37:13,800 --> 01:37:16,200
...you've only lost yourself.'

1098
01:37:16,280 --> 01:37:18,360
'Rafiq. We must leave now.'

1099
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,000
'Magnam tours and travels.'

1100
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:26,840
Hard drive.

1101
01:37:30,600 --> 01:37:32,200
'I've sent everyone
their train tickets.'

1102
01:37:32,320 --> 01:37:34,360
'And there will be just one trigger.'

1103
01:37:34,680 --> 01:37:35,600
'Me.'

1104
01:37:36,320 --> 01:37:38,080
But why?

1105
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:42,080
That night changed everything.

1106
01:37:53,800 --> 01:37:55,400
He killed my father.

1107
01:37:56,320 --> 01:37:58,040
And burned down our homes.

1108
01:37:59,320 --> 01:38:01,680
So it was revenge.

1109
01:38:03,040 --> 01:38:04,720
We were only 10 years old...

1110
01:38:05,960 --> 01:38:08,800
...revenge seemed like the only option.

1111
01:38:09,640 --> 01:38:13,760
I spent a lifetime chasing Maqsood.

1112
01:38:14,920 --> 01:38:17,320
When we finally found him, I realized...

1113
01:38:17,440 --> 01:38:22,200
...that an ordinary goon had become
the leader of a terrorist organization.

1114
01:38:23,160 --> 01:38:25,920
Killing Maqsood wasn't as
important as finishing his ideology.

1115
01:38:26,040 --> 01:38:27,720
Finishing his Sleeper Cells.

1116
01:38:27,800 --> 01:38:30,120
- That was not your right.
- It is my right! It's everyone's right.

1117
01:38:30,880 --> 01:38:36,240
Every one of us believes that
such people should be publicly punished.

1118
01:38:38,080 --> 01:38:39,440
That's exactly what I did.

1119
01:38:39,960 --> 01:38:42,320
That compartment was
filled with Sleeper Cells.

1120
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:44,080
Not a single person was innocent.

1121
01:38:44,600 --> 01:38:46,640
I won't spare you two.

1122
01:38:48,680 --> 01:38:50,440
I don't expect anything less from you.

1123
01:38:52,440 --> 01:38:56,560
Now you do your job, and I'll do mine.

1124
01:38:59,360 --> 01:39:00,400
Goodbye.
