1
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,859
54.6 million kilometers.

2
00:01:38,844 --> 00:01:42,375
That's the distance
between the Earth and Mars.

3
00:01:43,242 --> 00:01:46,398
Travelling this distance
of 54.6 million kilometers

4
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:49,828
and reaching Mars
is my only aim.

5
00:01:52,797 --> 00:01:55,805
Light travels at a speed of
300,000 kilometers in a second.

6
00:01:57,515 --> 00:01:59,741
Man's thought is faster than that.

7
00:02:01,961 --> 00:02:05,078
That is how, saints used to
time travel in ancient times.

8
00:02:07,992 --> 00:02:09,398
I am going to do the same.

9
00:02:10,031 --> 00:02:11,313
Scientifically.

10
00:02:12,374 --> 00:02:13,788
People laugh if I say this.

11
00:02:14,891 --> 00:02:16,130
Would they have
laughed at me had I

12
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:17,413
said I want to be
like Virat Kohli

13
00:02:17,493 --> 00:02:19,220
or Sundar Pichai?

14
00:02:20,445 --> 00:02:22,156
They laughed at my father as well.

15
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:26,320
But he never bothered.

16
00:02:26,702 --> 00:02:28,718
He ignored everything
and kept moving on.

17
00:02:35,742 --> 00:02:36,953
The first time,

18
00:02:37,102 --> 00:02:40,789
my dad told me we were going to
Mars, I was super excited.

19
00:03:11,242 --> 00:03:12,297
Are you scared?

20
00:03:12,391 --> 00:03:14,188
I'm a little scared, dad.
- Come.

21
00:03:15,859 --> 00:03:18,898
I just don't want to leave you
alone on earth and go.

22
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:22,836
Can we definitely go to mars?

23
00:03:23,109 --> 00:03:24,477
We'll definitely go.

24
00:03:35,211 --> 00:03:38,093
No rocket is needed,
nor is any equipment required.

25
00:03:38,734 --> 00:03:43,008
My dad firmly believed, one can
travel to mars using one's brain.

26
00:03:44,528 --> 00:03:46,020
My dad is a genius.

27
00:03:56,364 --> 00:03:57,746
But nothing happened.

28
00:03:58,036 --> 00:04:00,137
My legs started aching,
standing for so long.

29
00:04:13,301 --> 00:04:17,575
I couldn't ask my dad why did
we fail to go to Mars?

30
00:04:18,817 --> 00:04:20,957
That's because, I knew
the question would hurt him.

31
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:27,972
But my mind said, there is some
truth in my dad's words.

32
00:04:55,294 --> 00:04:56,575
Twenty years!

33
00:04:57,051 --> 00:04:58,348
Like a robot,

34
00:04:58,817 --> 00:05:00,075
dad kept doing

35
00:05:00,411 --> 00:05:02,528
this experiment,
standing at the same place.

36
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:05,060
Dad, shall we go?

37
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,130
I understand your anger.

38
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:39,536
I have already narrated the story
of Ravan's Pushpaka Vimanam.

39
00:05:39,778 --> 00:05:41,823
Whenever Ravan wished...
- His Pushpak Plane appeared.

40
00:05:41,903 --> 00:05:44,856
And it took him to any place
he desired to reach.

41
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,380
That's because, it was Ravan's
thoughts that controlled it.

42
00:05:47,638 --> 00:05:49,521
We can travel through
our thoughts. Right?

43
00:05:49,935 --> 00:05:51,154
I am bored.

44
00:05:51,818 --> 00:05:53,803
We've been going to that hill
since twenty years.

45
00:05:54,037 --> 00:05:55,988
You've been trying
the same experiment since then.

46
00:05:56,068 --> 00:05:57,381
And you have been
failing in it.

47
00:05:57,537 --> 00:05:59,721
Not twenty years, even if it takes
a 100 years, it will happen.

48
00:05:59,801 --> 00:06:00,808
Because, it's a fact.

49
00:06:01,016 --> 00:06:02,313
So then where did you go wrong?

50
00:06:02,563 --> 00:06:04,016
One should have patience, Akash.

51
00:06:04,274 --> 00:06:05,494
Instead of going
to that hill, had

52
00:06:05,534 --> 00:06:06,865
you visited Sabarimala
for 20 years,

53
00:06:06,945 --> 00:06:08,545
you would've at least become
a Guruswamy.

54
00:07:25,654 --> 00:07:27,568
Two weeks back,

55
00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:30,138
didn't you tell me
you solved the equation?

56
00:07:30,286 --> 00:07:31,177
Yes, I did.

57
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:32,935
We partied back then.

58
00:07:36,693 --> 00:07:38,177
Let's party again.

59
00:07:39,201 --> 00:07:40,966
I really solved it this time.

60
00:07:41,638 --> 00:07:43,435
Really?
- I solved it.

61
00:07:44,169 --> 00:07:45,419
Did you?

62
00:07:45,779 --> 00:07:48,591
I solved the equation that my
dad couldn't for all these years.

63
00:07:49,638 --> 00:07:50,966
You solved the equation?

64
00:07:51,646 --> 00:07:53,654
He will wake up to
the solved equation tomorrow.

65
00:07:55,615 --> 00:07:56,755
He'll be happy.

66
00:07:57,576 --> 00:07:58,880
He will be happy.

67
00:07:58,982 --> 00:08:00,193
He will be highly elated.

68
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:01,817
He'll be highly elated.

69
00:08:01,911 --> 00:08:04,099
He will be highly elated.

70
00:08:04,911 --> 00:08:08,216
He will be extremely happy.

71
00:08:08,755 --> 00:08:10,560
He will be extremely happy.

72
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:19,371
He'll be very happy.

73
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:22,652
He will be highly elated.

74
00:08:37,441 --> 00:08:40,667
He'll be so happy.

75
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:44,878
He will be extremely happy.

76
00:08:51,848 --> 00:08:53,410
Your best friend Anand...

77
00:08:53,754 --> 00:08:56,473
His mom has complained
that he's missing since 3 days.

78
00:08:57,004 --> 00:08:58,504
You were last seen with him.

79
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:00,277
Where's Anand?

80
00:09:02,456 --> 00:09:05,644
'He will be extremely happy.'

81
00:09:08,574 --> 00:09:10,184
This is a de-addiction center.

82
00:09:10,652 --> 00:09:14,074
You were half dead when you
were found after a drug overdose.

83
00:09:14,418 --> 00:09:16,285
Your dad got you here.

84
00:09:25,589 --> 00:09:26,761
Where is Anand?

85
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:30,527
Is today Monday or Tuesday?

86
00:09:30,902 --> 00:09:34,051
Answer my question, first.
Where is Anand?

87
00:09:34,355 --> 00:09:37,417
Mister, do you know who sir is?
He is Thiruparkadal Kannan.

88
00:09:37,598 --> 00:09:39,605
Missing case expert.

89
00:09:39,723 --> 00:09:41,535
His question...
- I am talking.

90
00:09:44,012 --> 00:09:45,254
Do you see this coin?

91
00:09:45,355 --> 00:09:46,355
What if I do?

92
00:09:48,152 --> 00:09:49,152
What now?

93
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:50,410
It isn't visible.
- Right?

94
00:09:50,793 --> 00:09:51,848
You can't see the coin.

95
00:09:52,348 --> 00:09:53,793
This is called refraction.

96
00:09:54,035 --> 00:09:55,691
It is true that the coin
is not visible.

97
00:09:55,926 --> 00:09:57,504
That doesn't mean,
there's no coin.

98
00:09:57,871 --> 00:09:58,926
Similarly,

99
00:09:59,066 --> 00:10:01,574
you are looking for Anand
in a place he isn't.

100
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:03,613
Anand is definitely there.

101
00:10:03,824 --> 00:10:06,082
But he isn't here.
He is in some other place.

102
00:10:06,574 --> 00:10:09,014
Same incident can happen in
different places at the same time.

103
00:10:09,488 --> 00:10:11,556
A Thirupakadal
Kannan like you can

104
00:10:11,596 --> 00:10:13,824
be investigating
elsewhere like you.

105
00:10:14,402 --> 00:10:16,066
That's called Quantum Physics.

106
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,996
Do you believe I'm guilty?

107
00:10:19,441 --> 00:10:20,496
Do you?

108
00:10:21,285 --> 00:10:22,325
That's quite obvious, sir.

109
00:10:23,191 --> 00:10:24,238
Never mind, sir.

110
00:10:24,387 --> 00:10:26,598
But at least believe
the words of an accused.

111
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:28,270
Believe in me.

112
00:10:28,777 --> 00:10:31,121
I would not be talking to you
if I was guilty.

113
00:10:31,465 --> 00:10:32,520
I would've gone elsewhere.

114
00:10:33,184 --> 00:10:35,637
It's simple, sir. Won't it reflect
in my eyes if I lied?

115
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:37,316
Won't you see it in my eyes?

116
00:10:38,191 --> 00:10:39,746
Look into my eyes, sir.

117
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:48,519
Now, ask me anything.

118
00:11:22,522 --> 00:11:23,522
Fraud.

119
00:11:24,335 --> 00:11:25,600
Fraud.

120
00:11:25,991 --> 00:11:27,382
He is a fraud, sir.

121
00:11:27,554 --> 00:11:29,374
You have rightly identified him.

122
00:11:29,561 --> 00:11:30,952
But it is of no use.

123
00:11:31,054 --> 00:11:34,085
He is very confident
that you can do no harm to him.

124
00:11:34,265 --> 00:11:35,780
That is why, he is doing all this.

125
00:11:35,999 --> 00:11:37,405
You have this medicine.

126
00:11:39,124 --> 00:11:40,890
I've been taking this every day.

127
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,616
I don't think it is working.

128
00:11:42,999 --> 00:11:44,929
My anxiety seems to have increased.

129
00:11:45,085 --> 00:11:47,085
Sir, what did the physician
tell you?

130
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:50,600
The medicine will show its result
only after 90 days.

131
00:11:50,944 --> 00:11:53,842
It's been only two months, sir.
Isn't that too early to decide?

132
00:11:54,975 --> 00:11:56,460
You are right.

133
00:11:57,124 --> 00:11:59,084
They are frauds.
- Correct, sir.

134
00:11:59,288 --> 00:12:00,858
No one can fool you.

135
00:12:00,975 --> 00:12:02,155
Except me.
- What?

136
00:12:02,288 --> 00:12:04,328
I said, 'exactly'. Your phone is
ringing. Answer it.

137
00:12:08,546 --> 00:12:09,748
It's your wife.

138
00:12:09,921 --> 00:12:11,475
This is the 6th call
since morning.

139
00:12:11,858 --> 00:12:14,999
She is complaining, you beat her
up every night once you're drunk.

140
00:12:15,429 --> 00:12:16,858
Why do you drink every day?

141
00:12:17,046 --> 00:12:18,124
'Are you questioning me?'

142
00:12:18,318 --> 00:12:20,873
'I will make sure, you are
driven mad for this.'

143
00:12:21,405 --> 00:12:22,264
This is fate, sir.

144
00:12:22,358 --> 00:12:24,100
We need to meet the pastor.

145
00:12:24,429 --> 00:12:26,194
Velu, what you do is...

146
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:29,124
Hey, why are you standing there?

147
00:12:35,467 --> 00:12:37,959
Are you father-son duo
trying to fool me?

148
00:12:38,554 --> 00:12:40,382
Let's see for how long
will this continue.

149
00:12:41,038 --> 00:12:44,194
Do you have a proof
that my son did this?

150
00:12:44,546 --> 00:12:45,546
Proof, is it?

151
00:12:45,858 --> 00:12:47,163
Are you asking me for proof?

152
00:12:47,741 --> 00:12:48,757
I investigated.

153
00:12:49,116 --> 00:12:51,249
Not a single person had a good
opinion about your son.

154
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:53,733
When I met you last time,

155
00:12:53,827 --> 00:12:56,819
I told you everything that I knew,
without keeping any secret.

156
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:59,397
I have nothing new to say.

157
00:13:00,304 --> 00:13:01,507
May I go?

158
00:13:05,405 --> 00:13:07,108
What did he tell you, sir?

159
00:13:07,788 --> 00:13:08,936
He said, it's cake!

160
00:13:11,718 --> 00:13:12,929
Did he say that?

161
00:13:13,788 --> 00:13:15,028
I will tell you the truth, sir.

162
00:13:15,546 --> 00:13:17,491
It's true that I went to
Anand's room that day.

163
00:13:18,163 --> 00:13:20,538
But we did drugs and danced there.

164
00:13:21,537 --> 00:13:24,131
I swear in the name of God.
I really don't know about Anand.

165
00:13:26,007 --> 00:13:28,087
Those two fools thought,
I'd say something like this.

166
00:13:28,968 --> 00:13:30,968
They couldn't even look into
my eyes and speak.

167
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:33,874
They were staring as if they
made some mistake.

168
00:13:34,233 --> 00:13:36,843
You should have looked
at the SI's face.

169
00:13:39,421 --> 00:13:43,108
Akash, try to recall what happened
that night and tell me.

170
00:13:43,374 --> 00:13:45,468
I'll see our lawyer and find out
what can be done.

171
00:13:45,593 --> 00:13:47,833
This is your problem. If you were a
passionate scientist,

172
00:13:47,917 --> 00:13:49,715
you would've called and appreciated
me for I solved the equation.

173
00:13:49,795 --> 00:13:52,638
I solved the equation, mentioned
the co-ordinates and gave you.

174
00:13:52,888 --> 00:13:54,795
10.4489 degre North.

175
00:13:54,974 --> 00:13:57,771
77.5209 degree East.

176
00:13:58,076 --> 00:13:59,412
Are you pointing at Palani?

177
00:14:00,513 --> 00:14:03,803
I mean to say, the location you
chose to go to Mars was wrong.

178
00:14:04,068 --> 00:14:06,138
Akash, you're
an astro-physics student.

179
00:14:06,248 --> 00:14:08,295
How can you be so sure
that it's Palani?

180
00:14:08,435 --> 00:14:10,247
The Earth and Mars comes in line
at such short distance

181
00:14:10,327 --> 00:14:11,565
only once in twenty years.

182
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:12,842
Correct?
- Correct.

183
00:14:12,951 --> 00:14:14,972
That is going to happen
in the next 14 days, you agree?

184
00:14:15,052 --> 00:14:16,904
You must be here, Akash.
- Listen...

185
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:20,030
If I miss this line-up now, I'm not
sure when this will happen again.

186
00:14:20,123 --> 00:14:22,060
Can you say when it will happen?

187
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:24,326
It was your turn,
twenty years ago.

188
00:14:24,615 --> 00:14:26,513
Now, it is my turn.
I will do it.

189
00:15:21,382 --> 00:15:22,773
My new room-mate?

190
00:15:24,499 --> 00:15:25,499
Hi.

191
00:15:25,975 --> 00:15:27,069
I'm Andava Perumal.

192
00:15:29,437 --> 00:15:30,437
Oh, I see.

193
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:39,546
You are new to this place,
aren't you?

194
00:15:40,195 --> 00:15:41,593
I visit here often.

195
00:15:42,069 --> 00:15:45,163
I will give you some tips
as to how you should stay here.

196
00:15:46,962 --> 00:15:48,235
I am talking to you.

197
00:15:48,899 --> 00:15:50,907
You turned around and slept!

198
00:15:51,657 --> 00:15:54,118
Hey, I am talking to you.

199
00:15:58,611 --> 00:15:59,829
Andava Perumal...

200
00:16:00,407 --> 00:16:02,923
If I beat him, I'll be
the one in trouble.

201
00:16:04,072 --> 00:16:05,072
Relax.

202
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:07,070
Relax...

203
00:16:12,485 --> 00:16:17,212
(Song)

204
00:16:18,415 --> 00:16:19,555
Raga Gambhiranata.

205
00:16:20,758 --> 00:16:25,289
(Song)

206
00:16:26,172 --> 00:16:27,266
This is Natai.

207
00:16:28,032 --> 00:16:32,579
(Song)

208
00:16:32,735 --> 00:16:39,727
(Song)

209
00:16:40,024 --> 00:16:44,469
(Song)

210
00:16:55,649 --> 00:16:56,680
Jayantashree.

211
00:17:00,626 --> 00:17:03,071
Sir, pour it.
We need to finish by evening.

212
00:17:06,969 --> 00:17:09,445
Physician, how many pots
did you ask him to pour?

213
00:17:09,532 --> 00:17:10,329
108.

214
00:17:10,516 --> 00:17:12,656
You have no sense at all.

215
00:17:12,852 --> 00:17:15,359
Couldn't you have told him
at least 1008 or 5008?

216
00:17:15,438 --> 00:17:16,852
I cannot say just anything.

217
00:17:17,094 --> 00:17:19,186
If more water is poured over
his head, he'll catch cold.

218
00:17:19,266 --> 00:17:20,602
Is that so?

219
00:17:20,758 --> 00:17:23,251
The reason I am asking you is,
you told me that if I give him

220
00:17:23,337 --> 00:17:26,438
your medicine for three months,
he will lose his mental balance.

221
00:17:26,719 --> 00:17:28,665
I've been giving it to him
since two months.

222
00:17:28,876 --> 00:17:30,641
There's no result
as expected.

223
00:17:30,868 --> 00:17:32,102
Isn't he feeling more anxious?

224
00:17:32,251 --> 00:17:34,204
That's not enough,
he should burst.

225
00:17:34,407 --> 00:17:36,766
If that happens,
he will die immediately.

226
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:38,758
And then you will land in jail.

227
00:17:39,915 --> 00:17:42,618
There are two cases pending
in your name.

228
00:17:42,852 --> 00:17:45,915
Out of which the Sugandi
murder case is quite strong.

229
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:47,125
Beware.

230
00:17:52,047 --> 00:17:53,852
How will it be if Simbu
becomes the CM?

231
00:17:54,118 --> 00:17:56,094
He sounded really upset
over the phone yesterday.

232
00:17:56,508 --> 00:17:58,102
He wanted to be the CM
tomorrow itself.

233
00:17:58,219 --> 00:17:59,665
But how is that possible?

234
00:18:00,343 --> 00:18:01,734
Tomorrow is Sunday.

235
00:18:02,633 --> 00:18:04,473
There was a chance
if it was Monday or Tuesday.

236
00:19:34,782 --> 00:19:37,969
Oh! They don't let me be
in peace even for two minutes.

237
00:19:39,688 --> 00:19:41,328
They keep calling.

238
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:44,648
Sir, you are handling this case.

239
00:19:44,805 --> 00:19:47,399
Then how did Sir Pandian
hear about

240
00:19:47,618 --> 00:19:50,125
Anand's dead body
even before you knew?

241
00:19:50,461 --> 00:19:51,852
That is what I am wondering.

242
00:19:52,118 --> 00:19:54,678
I'm constantly trying to reach,
but he isn't answering his phone.

243
00:19:54,829 --> 00:19:55,829
Disconnect it, sir.

244
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,079
Why?
- If you call him now,

245
00:19:58,193 --> 00:19:59,980
he'll ask you to come
straight to the police station

246
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:02,310
So what?
- If you go there, in front of

247
00:20:02,389 --> 00:20:05,076
everyone else, he'll take you
to task. Is that needed?

248
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:06,428
What do you suggest?

249
00:20:06,505 --> 00:20:08,896
Before he goes there, let us
find out his current whereabout

250
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:10,662
and go, fall on his feet
right there.

251
00:20:11,537 --> 00:20:12,834
Okay, let's go to the station.

252
00:20:14,201 --> 00:20:15,318
I'll fall on his feet.

253
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,318
Who out of these two
is Mr Pandian?

254
00:20:43,943 --> 00:20:45,201
Sorry, sir.

255
00:20:46,129 --> 00:20:49,255
We couldn't catch Anand alive,
despite all our efforts.

256
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,350
We've informed his family.

257
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:54,717
Are you not ashamed of yourself?
Seven people!

258
00:20:55,084 --> 00:20:57,998
If you cannot load 300 gunny bags
in two trucks, why are you there?

259
00:20:58,162 --> 00:20:59,514
Hang up, I'll be there.

260
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,904
Sir, wash your face and go.

261
00:21:01,021 --> 00:21:02,748
Washing is what they do
over there.

262
00:21:04,092 --> 00:21:05,568
You said, he was Mr Pandian.

263
00:21:05,685 --> 00:21:07,693
I was about to say
that he isn't the one,

264
00:21:07,848 --> 00:21:09,193
but you jumped into
a conclusion.

265
00:21:26,407 --> 00:21:27,446
What is it?

266
00:21:28,298 --> 00:21:30,697
I thought you'd catch Anand
alive, but you got him dead.

267
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,290
Give me a towel.

268
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,087
No, sir. Actually...

269
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:35,251
What is it?

270
00:21:35,821 --> 00:21:37,415
Yes, sir. Anand...

271
00:21:38,197 --> 00:21:40,149
Yes or no? Stick to one answer

272
00:21:40,259 --> 00:21:40,962
Sir...

273
00:21:41,228 --> 00:21:43,478
Since he has been chasing
this case for long,

274
00:21:43,767 --> 00:21:46,259
he is in a confused
state of mind, sir.

275
00:21:46,806 --> 00:21:48,892
That is not true, sir.
I am fine.

276
00:21:49,369 --> 00:21:51,798
We even consulted a local
herbalist for this problem.

277
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:56,087
What does a herbalist got to do
in this case? - Sir...

278
00:21:56,376 --> 00:21:58,533
He is not an expert
only in medicines, but also

279
00:21:58,814 --> 00:22:02,571
in other practices using a betel
leaf for predictions. Heard it?

280
00:22:02,665 --> 00:22:03,845
A betel leaf for prediction?

281
00:22:03,994 --> 00:22:06,720
He used the betel leaf trick
and told us straight

282
00:22:06,869 --> 00:22:09,345
that Akash has committed
this murder. He has already

283
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:10,759
confirmed it to him, sir.

284
00:22:12,259 --> 00:22:15,853
Did he use a betel leaf to find
out Akash committed the murder?

285
00:22:18,197 --> 00:22:20,376
Yes, sir.
- So, the Sundar Rajan case

286
00:22:20,587 --> 00:22:23,027
has been delayed for too long.
Will he find that murderer too?

287
00:22:25,321 --> 00:22:26,883
He will, if we ask him to, sir.

288
00:22:27,455 --> 00:22:29,775
Why are you in the police
department? You don't deserve it.

289
00:22:32,415 --> 00:22:34,642
I will give you 48 hours.

290
00:22:35,634 --> 00:22:37,455
I want the real culprit. Got it?

291
00:22:37,869 --> 00:22:40,439
Find the person who is actually
behind this and close the case.

292
00:22:40,572 --> 00:22:42,947
Otherwise, your VRS,

293
00:22:43,197 --> 00:22:45,642
your pension,
you can forget everything.

294
00:22:45,876 --> 00:22:47,439
Explain it to him.

295
00:22:54,923 --> 00:22:55,923
No...

296
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:58,915
Why did you have to narrate
that story of betel leaf? - Sir...

297
00:22:59,251 --> 00:23:01,572
When he asked about Sunder Rajan,

298
00:23:01,798 --> 00:23:03,494
why did you agree unnecessarily?

299
00:23:03,775 --> 00:23:05,455
You are the one who put it
in our mind.

300
00:23:06,392 --> 00:23:07,931
I have a doubt, sir.

301
00:23:08,236 --> 00:23:09,236
What is it?

302
00:23:09,486 --> 00:23:11,494
Did he really need a facial
for this ugly face?

303
00:23:16,283 --> 00:23:17,595
In the end,

304
00:23:18,095 --> 00:23:20,970
I am not a part of
the band I formed.

305
00:23:23,478 --> 00:23:24,580
Like you said,

306
00:23:24,759 --> 00:23:27,970
I do drugs and in a high,
thrash up a few people

307
00:23:28,103 --> 00:23:30,220
during every show of mine.

308
00:23:30,642 --> 00:23:32,899
All of you are defamed
because of me. - No...

309
00:23:33,103 --> 00:23:35,165
No, listen to me.
- Each one of you.

310
00:23:35,376 --> 00:23:37,619
Suppose, there's a show tomorrow.

311
00:23:38,009 --> 00:23:39,830
We're going to do a show,
tomorrow.

312
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:40,946
Without me?

313
00:23:41,025 --> 00:23:43,852
No, let me finish. For example,
there's a show tomorrow.

314
00:23:43,977 --> 00:23:46,054
You will perform without me?
- No, hear me out first.

315
00:23:46,134 --> 00:23:47,783
Okay? We're doing a show tomorrow.

316
00:23:48,244 --> 00:23:49,642
Like this, you come out.

317
00:23:49,978 --> 00:23:52,645
Okay? How can we be sure,
you won't do this once out?

318
00:23:54,681 --> 00:23:56,618
Psycho... You are a psycho.

319
00:23:57,744 --> 00:23:59,220
Am I a psycho?

320
00:23:59,361 --> 00:24:01,814
Why are you beating me up?
Beat him up. Why only me?

321
00:24:01,915 --> 00:24:04,782
Beat him as well.
Why are you beating me alone?

322
00:24:17,656 --> 00:24:18,820
I should not have come.

323
00:24:19,874 --> 00:24:21,983
Looks like, you came to tell me
not to come here.

324
00:24:24,109 --> 00:24:25,109
Hey,

325
00:24:25,648 --> 00:24:26,976
go and sit elsewhere.

326
00:24:30,554 --> 00:24:31,554
Hey!

327
00:24:32,187 --> 00:24:34,586
I am a senior here.
You may change your place.

328
00:24:39,406 --> 00:24:42,726
This is what happens when one
has more calories in one's body.

329
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:44,422
One gets too hyper.

330
00:24:45,508 --> 00:24:47,633
You want to go to the South
and bang your head?

331
00:24:48,562 --> 00:24:50,070
That will reduce 150 calories.

332
00:24:50,695 --> 00:24:52,781
150 calories! It's a science fact.

333
00:24:54,109 --> 00:24:57,304
It's people like you who have more
chances of attempting suicide.

334
00:25:02,195 --> 00:25:03,476
I can see that in your eyes.

335
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:06,290
You will hang yourself to death
in this same room...

336
00:25:08,015 --> 00:25:09,015
Yes.

337
00:25:16,625 --> 00:25:18,672
That pastor is responsible
for all of this.

338
00:25:19,367 --> 00:25:21,211
He will die at my hands.

339
00:25:21,633 --> 00:25:23,047
It's confirmed. Suicide...

340
00:25:29,562 --> 00:25:30,898
Shall we flee from here?

341
00:25:36,101 --> 00:25:38,890
Should the two of us
escape from here?

342
00:25:43,827 --> 00:25:45,093
Trusting you?

343
00:25:45,499 --> 00:25:47,070
Who else can you trust
other than me?

344
00:25:51,593 --> 00:25:54,530
Shall we kill that pastor and flee?

345
00:25:57,726 --> 00:25:58,726
What do you say?

346
00:26:00,484 --> 00:26:01,585
Really?

347
00:26:03,334 --> 00:26:04,467
Really?

348
00:26:22,965 --> 00:26:24,762
Sir, those boys stole my bike.

349
00:26:24,882 --> 00:26:25,929
What color?

350
00:26:26,991 --> 00:26:28,914
What model was it?
- 2005, sir.

351
00:26:29,249 --> 00:26:31,009
Was the tyre new?
- I recently changed those.

352
00:26:31,101 --> 00:26:32,531
What's its mileage?

353
00:26:33,031 --> 00:26:35,109
40 kms, sir.
- Wait here.

354
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,140
Sir...

355
00:26:41,452 --> 00:26:42,452
Sir.

356
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:45,491
His bike is missing too...
- Please,

357
00:26:45,601 --> 00:26:47,765
track it down.
- Wait, I'm talking to him.

358
00:26:48,304 --> 00:26:50,679
He says, those two boys
stole it.

359
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:54,429
He also says, it gives 40 kms
per litre mileage.

360
00:26:54,968 --> 00:26:56,640
It was blessed by the pastor.

361
00:26:56,843 --> 00:26:58,366
Do you have any sense?

362
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,382
Sir is already worked up
for not being able to find them.

363
00:27:01,593 --> 00:27:04,156
Mr Pandian just humiliated him.

364
00:27:04,359 --> 00:27:06,484
And you're complaining
about your missing bike.

365
00:27:06,663 --> 00:27:07,663
Go away, sir.

366
00:27:13,726 --> 00:27:14,726
Sir...

367
00:27:15,398 --> 00:27:16,398
Sir...

368
00:27:17,405 --> 00:27:18,764
Mr Pandian told you

369
00:27:18,843 --> 00:27:22,023
to forget about your pension
and VRS forever.

370
00:27:24,577 --> 00:27:26,171
What does that mean, sir?

371
00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:31,281
Vadapazhani, Tiruthani,
Tiruchendur,

372
00:27:31,531 --> 00:27:33,968
Lord Murugan's temples
are in all these places too.

373
00:27:34,148 --> 00:27:36,171
Why do you insist on
going to Palani itself? - Hey!

374
00:27:36,366 --> 00:27:38,466
I am not going to Palani
to visit Lord Muruga's temple.

375
00:27:38,546 --> 00:27:39,546
So then?

376
00:27:39,663 --> 00:27:42,007
According to Science,
the only place where Mars'

377
00:27:42,124 --> 00:27:45,156
70% power reflects on Earth
is Palani.

378
00:27:45,741 --> 00:27:48,812
Have many people gone to Mars
from Palani temple already?

379
00:27:49,132 --> 00:27:50,523
You won't understand.

380
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:51,991
So explain to me.

381
00:27:52,523 --> 00:27:55,452
Do you know the power of human
thoughts? - Assume that I do.

382
00:27:56,273 --> 00:27:59,359
In this whole universe, human
thoughts travels faster than light.

383
00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:01,320
Do you get it?
How will you understand?

384
00:28:01,546 --> 00:28:03,960
I am thinking of being at a wine
shop now. Why am I not there?

385
00:28:04,023 --> 00:28:06,093
I need to reach... Ride faster.

386
00:28:48,174 --> 00:28:49,393
He is my son, sir.

387
00:28:49,549 --> 00:28:51,338
I am more concerned about him,
than you are.

388
00:28:51,494 --> 00:28:53,885
Don't call and disturb me
so often.

389
00:28:54,072 --> 00:28:56,798
Do you understand? I will
inform you immediately if he comes.

390
00:29:04,111 --> 00:29:06,697
I came to take my spacesuit.
I'll leave once I take it.

391
00:29:06,822 --> 00:29:08,510
You have no patience, Akash.

392
00:29:08,924 --> 00:29:11,244
You wait and see.
You won't go to Mars,

393
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:12,760
but instead land in jail.

394
00:29:13,643 --> 00:29:14,940
I was there for ten days.

395
00:29:15,096 --> 00:29:16,940
You thought of coming to
see me only once.

396
00:29:17,299 --> 00:29:19,580
Your plan was to retain me
there for three months.

397
00:29:19,776 --> 00:29:21,838
Why would I be happy
to send you there?

398
00:29:22,072 --> 00:29:23,658
I did that for your good.

399
00:29:24,111 --> 00:29:25,220
You are jealous, dad.

400
00:29:25,408 --> 00:29:28,666
You couldn't do what you aimed
at, for twenty long years.

401
00:29:29,502 --> 00:29:31,319
The second day after I solved
the equation, you put me

402
00:29:31,399 --> 00:29:32,491
in a de-addiction center.

403
00:29:32,611 --> 00:29:34,091
I realized your true
color right then.

404
00:29:37,533 --> 00:29:38,533
Sir...

405
00:29:40,955 --> 00:29:42,236
I have just one question.

406
00:29:43,205 --> 00:29:46,040
How far is Mars from Palani?
- Are you accompanying him?

407
00:30:09,048 --> 00:30:10,314
Actually, I have met you.

408
00:30:10,541 --> 00:30:12,701
At the de-addiction center.
You came to meet him there.

409
00:30:12,932 --> 00:30:13,986
I'm Andava Perumal.

410
00:30:14,713 --> 00:30:15,713
Hey...

411
00:30:16,049 --> 00:30:17,049
Let's go.

412
00:30:17,385 --> 00:30:19,291
Akash, keep this
cell phone with you.

413
00:30:19,791 --> 00:30:23,026
What for? Should I call to
inform you once I reach Mars?

414
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:24,861
Come, let us go.

415
00:30:25,838 --> 00:30:28,932
He won't take the phone, just inform
your whereabouts regularly.

416
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:30,776
You gave me only the phone.

417
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:32,740
I need to take your son
all the way to Palani.

418
00:30:33,799 --> 00:30:35,151
Here, take this as well.

419
00:30:36,713 --> 00:30:38,783
Will you transfer online
once this money is over?

420
00:30:40,291 --> 00:30:42,361
Tell me. How will you send more
once this is over?

421
00:31:45,956 --> 00:31:46,995
Shall we go, sir?

422
00:31:48,917 --> 00:31:51,174
Sir, why did you slap me now?

423
00:31:51,292 --> 00:31:52,964
Why did I slap you?
Two of them escaped

424
00:31:53,004 --> 00:31:54,417
on a bike right in front of you.

425
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:56,548
Instead of catching them,
you're standing idle here.

426
00:31:56,628 --> 00:31:58,838
Who went, sir?
There's no one.

427
00:31:59,049 --> 00:32:02,307
Akash and Andava Perumal
just left from here.

428
00:32:02,534 --> 00:32:04,143
Sir, no one went from there.

429
00:32:04,259 --> 00:32:06,283
Look, the road is isolated.

430
00:32:06,573 --> 00:32:09,971
Look over there, you can still
the smoke emitted by the bike.

431
00:32:10,424 --> 00:32:11,455
This is what

432
00:32:11,612 --> 00:32:14,448
happened in an English movie
wherein a Mathematics teacher...

433
00:32:14,588 --> 00:32:16,104
How am I related to
a math teacher?

434
00:32:16,229 --> 00:32:18,456
You are. He was as brilliant as you.

435
00:32:18,674 --> 00:32:22,424
But he saw things
no one else could.

436
00:32:26,213 --> 00:32:27,354
Do you see this jeep?

437
00:32:27,924 --> 00:32:30,026
Sir, this is the jeep we came in.

438
00:32:31,026 --> 00:32:32,409
Do you hear the sound?

439
00:32:32,581 --> 00:32:35,034
If you see the jeep, why didn't
you see them going?

440
00:32:35,378 --> 00:32:36,378
Sir...

441
00:32:36,768 --> 00:32:39,940
I think the physician's words
are coming true.

442
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:42,526
Did you take your medicine?
Tell me.

443
00:32:43,057 --> 00:32:44,127
No, did you?

444
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,122
Nothing will be
under your control

445
00:32:46,162 --> 00:32:47,604
if you don't take
medicine on time.

446
00:32:47,732 --> 00:32:50,857
He told you, things would get
out of control. Did you forget?

447
00:32:51,278 --> 00:32:53,669
Wait for a while, I'll go
and get your medicine.

448
00:33:00,193 --> 00:33:03,575
Hey, don't go by the main road.
Take the interior village roads.

449
00:33:04,043 --> 00:33:06,942
You want me to drop you
at Palani, right? I know the way.

450
00:33:12,973 --> 00:33:13,973
Hey...

451
00:33:14,457 --> 00:33:15,660
Why did you stop?

452
00:33:17,637 --> 00:33:18,746
I'm asking you.

453
00:33:18,934 --> 00:33:19,934
Get off.

454
00:33:20,934 --> 00:33:22,848
What is it?
- Get off, I say.

455
00:33:26,965 --> 00:33:28,223
Don't do this.

456
00:33:28,465 --> 00:33:30,075
Don't sing!

457
00:33:30,762 --> 00:33:32,192
Don't!

458
00:33:32,965 --> 00:33:34,762
Don't do this, I say!

459
00:33:34,957 --> 00:33:36,770
Don't play that.

460
00:33:37,418 --> 00:33:39,192
Don't play that, I say!

461
00:33:39,489 --> 00:33:43,192
Hey, he is playing it. I cannot
bear the sound. Ask him to stop.

462
00:33:44,457 --> 00:33:46,864
He is annoying me.

463
00:33:47,621 --> 00:33:50,551
Ask him to stop it.

464
00:33:51,004 --> 00:33:54,629
Stop, please...

465
00:33:55,027 --> 00:33:56,027
No!

466
00:34:07,829 --> 00:34:08,829
Did he go away?

467
00:34:09,689 --> 00:34:12,385
That dog is at a distance
of just 30 kilometers from here.

468
00:34:12,627 --> 00:34:15,665
Let us go to his house,
break his fingers.

469
00:34:15,838 --> 00:34:18,119
Then he will never be able to
play guitar in his lifetime.

470
00:34:18,596 --> 00:34:20,752
I have no time for that.
Start the bike, let's go.

471
00:34:20,963 --> 00:34:22,916
I am not your driver.
Don't treat me like one.

472
00:34:23,705 --> 00:34:25,785
We are short of time.
Come, let us go. - No, I can't.

473
00:34:26,783 --> 00:34:29,221
Listen to me.
- He is at a distance of 30 kms.

474
00:34:29,369 --> 00:34:31,094
Let's go straight there
and break his fingers.

475
00:34:31,174 --> 00:34:33,384
And then, I'll drop you
at Palani. Come, let us go.

476
00:34:39,924 --> 00:34:43,627
It's reflecting somewhere
near Dindivanam.

477
00:34:43,814 --> 00:34:45,158
Sir, how did you find out?

478
00:34:45,275 --> 00:34:47,314
I got the information
from our cyber cell.

479
00:34:47,486 --> 00:34:50,775
You mean, from Dandapani?
He is a useless fellow, sir.

480
00:34:50,978 --> 00:34:53,908
He always gives you
wrong information.

481
00:34:54,088 --> 00:34:56,572
That is why, I verified
with Shankar Lingam as well.

482
00:34:56,869 --> 00:34:59,049
Shankar Lingam is even worse, sir.

483
00:34:59,306 --> 00:35:01,759
He would've said something
to confuse us.

484
00:35:01,955 --> 00:35:03,283
And you believed him.

485
00:35:03,447 --> 00:35:04,885
This is your problem.

486
00:35:05,057 --> 00:35:07,721
Be it your wife or the department,
you suspect everyone.

487
00:35:07,955 --> 00:35:10,025
Suspicion is what helps us
earn our living, sir.

488
00:35:10,127 --> 00:35:12,721
Does that mean, you'll suspect
your own wife?

489
00:35:12,939 --> 00:35:14,462
No, sir.

490
00:35:14,783 --> 00:35:16,431
But in order to maintain
law and order,

491
00:35:16,551 --> 00:35:18,999
like how King Manuneethi Cholan
gave a name to the breasts...

492
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:21,025
He tied a bell to a cow.

493
00:35:21,135 --> 00:35:22,135
Is it?

494
00:35:22,252 --> 00:35:23,978
It must be right if you say so.

495
00:35:24,486 --> 00:35:27,150
No matter the entire department
helps you or not,

496
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,572
you left as an one-man army.

497
00:35:30,221 --> 00:35:31,947
I feel so proud to be

498
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:33,947
working with you, sir.

499
00:35:48,199 --> 00:35:49,199
Hey!

500
00:35:49,644 --> 00:35:50,769
How long will it take?

501
00:35:51,925 --> 00:35:55,058
You brought me along
saying that you'lll go to Mars.

502
00:35:55,558 --> 00:35:57,207
I believed you and came along.

503
00:35:57,527 --> 00:35:59,277
This is ordinary,
won't you believe this?

504
00:35:59,675 --> 00:36:00,988
You must believe in humans.

505
00:36:01,261 --> 00:36:02,472
Only then will life be good.

506
00:36:02,754 --> 00:36:05,363
I'll wait for you, but please
don't talk philosophy.

507
00:36:17,379 --> 00:36:18,447
Harish...

508
00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:21,838
Harish!

509
00:36:24,853 --> 00:36:25,978
Where are you?

510
00:36:27,885 --> 00:36:28,885
Hari...

511
00:36:30,923 --> 00:36:33,455
Hari... Where are you?

512
00:36:35,275 --> 00:36:36,056
Harish!

513
00:36:36,142 --> 00:36:40,306
If you don't make him defecate
and remove the 3 million stuff

514
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:42,588
in his stomach out,
I won't let you go alive.

515
00:36:42,759 --> 00:36:43,821
It's not my mistake.

516
00:36:44,307 --> 00:36:48,095
I gave him clear instructions to
swallow it in a specially made cover

517
00:36:48,244 --> 00:36:50,080
in Singapore and then
defecate it in India.

518
00:36:50,369 --> 00:36:52,760
He made a mistake by keeping
it in a balloon and swallowing.

519
00:36:53,111 --> 00:36:55,236
Don't scream at me
instead of asking him.

520
00:36:55,447 --> 00:36:57,471
Remember, I am a Government doctor.

521
00:37:04,135 --> 00:37:05,338
What did I tell you?

522
00:37:06,275 --> 00:37:07,666
Swallow it in Singapore.

523
00:37:08,002 --> 00:37:09,455
Come to India and defecate.

524
00:37:09,814 --> 00:37:10,932
Wasn't that simple?

525
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:13,322
Couldn't you do such a simple thing?

526
00:37:13,455 --> 00:37:14,588
Believe me, sir.

527
00:37:14,846 --> 00:37:17,822
I misplaced the cover he gave me,
in a hurry to reach the airport.

528
00:37:18,018 --> 00:37:20,283
I saw a balloon vendor
on my way.

529
00:37:20,564 --> 00:37:21,986
I bought a balloon from him,

530
00:37:22,113 --> 00:37:24,893
stuffed all your goods in it
and just swallowed it, sir.

531
00:37:25,189 --> 00:37:27,072
It's all inside my stomach.

532
00:37:27,307 --> 00:37:30,142
I'll give it to you once I defecate.
Please believe me, sir. - When?

533
00:37:30,618 --> 00:37:32,298
Hey, stop!
- Where is Harish?

534
00:37:32,549 --> 00:37:34,749
Fatso, where are you barging in?
- I'll break your head.

535
00:37:34,854 --> 00:37:36,330
Hey!
- Beat him up!

536
00:37:37,229 --> 00:37:38,229
Who are you?

537
00:37:38,424 --> 00:37:40,431
Hey, who are you?
- How dare you...

538
00:37:40,518 --> 00:37:42,322
He has got nothing to do with that.

539
00:37:42,501 --> 00:37:43,540
Sir, be seated.

540
00:37:43,744 --> 00:37:45,916
He is my guitarist friend
Harish's friend.

541
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:48,150
Sir, they are not related
in any other way.

542
00:37:48,346 --> 00:37:49,900
Please, sir. Be seated.

543
00:37:50,307 --> 00:37:52,424
He is a friend's friend, is it?
- Yes, sir.

544
00:37:53,141 --> 00:37:55,572
What are you doing here?
Why did you come?

545
00:37:56,025 --> 00:37:57,837
Hey, I'm asking you. Tell me.

546
00:37:58,002 --> 00:37:59,775
He left saying that he had a show.

547
00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:02,338
He is not at home right now,
you please leave.

548
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,205
He said what he had to.

549
00:38:04,393 --> 00:38:07,361
Now, run away before I break
your limbs and bones.

550
00:38:07,604 --> 00:38:09,684
I will deal with you guys
once I am back from Palani.

551
00:38:10,604 --> 00:38:12,143
It's cocaine worth
3 million rupees.

552
00:38:12,822 --> 00:38:15,462
You've kept it inside your stomach
for four hours and harassing us.

553
00:38:15,916 --> 00:38:17,601
You rascal!

554
00:38:17,721 --> 00:38:19,776
Tear his stomach apart
and take it out.

555
00:38:19,896 --> 00:38:21,682
Sir, I am a family man
with children.

556
00:38:21,885 --> 00:38:25,142
I will somehow take it out of my
stomach and hand it. Spare me.

557
00:38:25,494 --> 00:38:27,581
Can you give him an enema
and take it out?

558
00:38:27,701 --> 00:38:30,627
Of course, I can. But the balloon
inside his stomach will burst.

559
00:38:30,752 --> 00:38:33,572
Cocaine worth 3 million rupees will
go down the drain. Is that okay?

560
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:37,236
Cocaine worth 3 millions! You're
saying it so casually. - Sir...

561
00:38:37,596 --> 00:38:39,939
Aren't you gone yet?

562
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:41,916
Can I get cocaine for Rs 2000?

563
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:44,150
For Rs 2000? You...

564
00:38:46,158 --> 00:38:47,221
I have the money.

565
00:38:47,377 --> 00:38:50,221
Do I look like someone who sells
drugs for peanuts?

566
00:38:51,143 --> 00:38:52,393
Get out, you dog!

567
00:38:54,252 --> 00:38:57,007
Just crush this dog
and everything will be fine.

568
00:39:08,861 --> 00:39:10,236
How long did you make me wait?

569
00:39:25,525 --> 00:39:27,204
Did you break your friend's hands?

570
00:39:33,078 --> 00:39:36,117
Well, why is your cheek swollen?

571
00:41:27,074 --> 00:41:29,027
Hey, no. Please don't be afraid...

572
00:41:29,128 --> 00:41:31,613
Look... I am watching you
through this hole.

573
00:41:31,738 --> 00:41:33,698
Don't be afraid. Come on.

574
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,597
Come...

575
00:41:35,683 --> 00:41:37,308
Please... Sir...

576
00:41:37,418 --> 00:41:39,338
You seem to be a good man.
Please take this off..

577
00:41:39,418 --> 00:41:42,378
Yes, please. Come on, hold it.

578
00:41:42,472 --> 00:41:45,238
Come on, pull it off.

579
00:41:45,339 --> 00:41:47,582
Take only this off, not my head.

580
00:41:48,535 --> 00:41:51,222
Just miss! This exactly!

581
00:41:51,394 --> 00:41:53,800
In the same force, if something
hit me like that,

582
00:41:53,941 --> 00:41:55,487
I will die.
- Who are you?

583
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:57,980
I'm an IT employee, Karthik
Krishnamurthy who wants to die.

584
00:41:58,402 --> 00:42:00,563
It's okay if you don't shake hands
with me. I will lie down here.

585
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:03,230
Ride over my neck and kill me.
Okay?

586
00:42:03,323 --> 00:42:04,776
Why did you put that on your head?

587
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:06,527
That's a microwave oven.

588
00:42:06,668 --> 00:42:09,152
I saw on Youtube, an American
put his head inside it

589
00:42:09,284 --> 00:42:12,636
and turned the switch on.
The radiation roasted his head.

590
00:42:12,839 --> 00:42:15,150
I followed all the procedure rightly
to die in a similar manner.

591
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:17,441
But I think it's a China make.
It isn't working.

592
00:42:17,652 --> 00:42:20,339
Thank God, it worked as a helmet
and saved my life.

593
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,572
You saved me
by taking it off my head.

594
00:42:21,652 --> 00:42:24,441
Do me another favor by
killing me, please. I beg you.

595
00:42:24,605 --> 00:42:25,660
Hey...
- Stop it.

596
00:42:25,808 --> 00:42:27,486
You wanted to die, right?
So, put your head inside it and die.

597
00:42:27,566 --> 00:42:30,082
Why would I beg you if I wanted
to die using that?

598
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:31,792
Please...

599
00:42:31,871 --> 00:42:32,683
Will you leave?

600
00:42:32,777 --> 00:42:34,144
Please...

601
00:42:35,683 --> 00:42:37,949
Brother, the one in red shirt
has got up.

602
00:42:41,276 --> 00:42:42,370
Where are you going?

603
00:42:44,003 --> 00:42:46,360
I tried waking you, but you didn't.

604
00:42:46,722 --> 00:42:48,183
I'm running late, so I am leaving.

605
00:42:48,847 --> 00:42:50,660
You want to get up?

606
00:42:50,988 --> 00:42:53,425
Let me go.

607
00:42:55,035 --> 00:42:56,035
What if I didn't wake up?

608
00:42:56,425 --> 00:42:57,494
Will you leave me here and go?

609
00:42:57,574 --> 00:43:00,074
Hello... - If you lied
injured here,

610
00:43:00,316 --> 00:43:01,894
I would've taken you
to a hospital.

611
00:43:02,035 --> 00:43:03,329
You are standing right
in front of me, talking.

612
00:43:03,409 --> 00:43:05,690
Kill me and go. It's late...

613
00:43:05,871 --> 00:43:07,957
I was unconscious all this while.

614
00:43:08,347 --> 00:43:10,175
What if blood oozed out of my head?

615
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:11,252
Would you have left me here?

616
00:43:11,332 --> 00:43:13,996
It wasn't that serious. I knew,
you'd come around in some time.

617
00:43:14,222 --> 00:43:15,464
Are you a human?

618
00:43:15,636 --> 00:43:16,456
Brother!

619
00:43:16,582 --> 00:43:17,611
Were you riding the bike?

620
00:43:17,636 --> 00:43:19,886
Will you drive as fast as that
and run over me?

621
00:43:20,027 --> 00:43:21,168
Please, brother!

622
00:43:21,918 --> 00:43:22,918
Hey...

623
00:43:23,152 --> 00:43:25,213
Did you jump in front of our bike?
- Yes, I'll do that again.

624
00:43:25,293 --> 00:43:26,409
Please, kill me.

625
00:43:26,503 --> 00:43:27,980
So, that's you?
- Please! - Die!

626
00:43:29,636 --> 00:43:31,777
This exactly!

627
00:43:31,910 --> 00:43:34,402
If it hits in the same force,

628
00:43:34,503 --> 00:43:36,808
I will die. Come on,
start the bike.

629
00:43:36,855 --> 00:43:39,565
Don't you see the bike is damaged?
How will he run over you?

630
00:43:39,738 --> 00:43:41,675
Mechanic! I will call a mechanic

631
00:43:41,753 --> 00:43:43,384
and get your bike repaired.
And then you may kill me. Okay?

632
00:43:43,464 --> 00:43:44,767
Will your dad pay the mechanic?

633
00:43:44,887 --> 00:43:46,730
My dad need not pay, I will.

634
00:43:46,850 --> 00:43:48,079
Take as much money as you want.

635
00:43:48,159 --> 00:43:49,774
First, run the bike over me
and just kill me. - Hey!

636
00:43:49,854 --> 00:43:51,956
Assume, the bike is fixed.
It weighs about 200 kgs.

637
00:43:52,168 --> 00:43:54,648
Both of us together might weigh
200 kgs which makes it 400 kgs.

638
00:43:54,824 --> 00:43:56,496
How can this weight kill you?

639
00:43:57,042 --> 00:43:57,862
Dimwit!

640
00:43:58,011 --> 00:43:58,964
What is he saying?

641
00:43:59,035 --> 00:44:01,035
He is right, he is a scientist.

642
00:44:01,652 --> 00:44:03,160
His job is to confuse others.

643
00:44:03,691 --> 00:44:05,082
Will you pay me?
- Yes, I will.

644
00:44:05,269 --> 00:44:06,389
Okay, I will give you money.

645
00:44:06,628 --> 00:44:08,105
Give me the money.

646
00:44:08,386 --> 00:44:09,769
Go and lie there.
- I will.

647
00:44:10,299 --> 00:44:12,925
Like you said, in full speed...
- Full speed!

648
00:44:13,027 --> 00:44:14,697
I will run the bike
in full speed over you.

649
00:44:14,777 --> 00:44:16,177
Yes, do it.
- You will die for sure.

650
00:44:16,324 --> 00:44:17,746
I will die. Superb!

651
00:44:17,832 --> 00:44:19,550
I'll count the money...

652
00:44:19,714 --> 00:44:20,714
Give it here.

653
00:44:20,816 --> 00:44:21,816
Hold on.

654
00:44:22,207 --> 00:44:23,207
What?

655
00:44:23,503 --> 00:44:25,425
I will have to first call
the mechanic,

656
00:44:25,644 --> 00:44:29,222
he'll come here, fix the bike

657
00:44:29,402 --> 00:44:31,191
and ony then will you kill me.

658
00:44:31,425 --> 00:44:34,386
You are asking me money in
advance! Are you trying to fool me?

659
00:44:34,519 --> 00:44:35,519
Do you think I am a fool?

660
00:44:35,785 --> 00:44:39,573
You're such a fraud and I have to
take your help to even die.

661
00:44:40,371 --> 00:44:42,511
You're a fraud.
- Don't call me a fraud.

662
00:44:42,574 --> 00:44:44,769
What else will I call a fraud?

663
00:45:01,363 --> 00:45:03,261
Am I still not dead?

664
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:06,980
Sir...

665
00:45:07,316 --> 00:45:08,558
Did you get hurt, sir?

666
00:45:09,636 --> 00:45:11,630
Should we go to a hospital, sir?

667
00:45:11,917 --> 00:45:13,628
Since how many years
have you been driving?

668
00:45:14,152 --> 00:45:16,793
Sir, it's been eight years.

669
00:45:16,941 --> 00:45:17,964
Eight years?

670
00:45:18,739 --> 00:45:19,818
Do you have a license?

671
00:45:19,935 --> 00:45:21,310
I do have it.

672
00:45:22,435 --> 00:45:23,591
What about FC?

673
00:45:23,724 --> 00:45:26,903
There's enough time for that,
but why are you asking me all that?

674
00:45:27,068 --> 00:45:30,317
Can anyone jump in front of
a car so accurately?

675
00:45:30,465 --> 00:45:31,957
What? Did you jump purposely?

676
00:45:32,169 --> 00:45:34,529
You jumped in front of my car
to create a scene here, is it?

677
00:45:34,771 --> 00:45:38,044
I jumped right in front of the
wheel, you could still not kill me.

678
00:45:38,161 --> 00:45:40,568
Who gave you a driving license?
- Sir!

679
00:45:40,950 --> 00:45:43,892
It is you who jumped in front of
the car. I cannot kill... - Hey!

680
00:45:44,012 --> 00:45:45,012
Sir...

681
00:45:48,107 --> 00:45:49,778
I cannot!

682
00:45:50,497 --> 00:45:53,521
Please... Let me go. No...

683
00:46:18,388 --> 00:46:20,489
What happened?

684
00:46:20,622 --> 00:46:22,739
What's wrong with you?

685
00:46:36,825 --> 00:46:39,465
This is the last stock.

686
00:46:40,786 --> 00:46:43,146
You want...

687
00:46:44,091 --> 00:46:47,207
I will give half of this to you.
Is this all you have?

688
00:46:47,427 --> 00:46:49,286
Is fifty-fifty okay?
- Please...

689
00:46:49,755 --> 00:46:51,107
Is fifty-fifty okay?

690
00:46:51,832 --> 00:46:53,598
Is fifty-fifty okay?

691
00:46:53,763 --> 00:46:56,107
I will give it to you if you
say you'll share it with me.

692
00:46:56,302 --> 00:46:58,693
Say it's okay and I'll give you.
- Okay.

693
00:47:33,849 --> 00:47:36,427
Hello. - I'm Akash's dad
speaking, hand the phone to him.

694
00:47:36,629 --> 00:47:37,629
You old man!

695
00:47:37,871 --> 00:47:39,471
You've called in the wrong time.
Hang up.

696
00:47:53,950 --> 00:47:54,950
Hey!

697
00:48:03,255 --> 00:48:04,474
Has it been two hours?

698
00:48:05,247 --> 00:48:06,247
What?

699
00:48:08,895 --> 00:48:11,036
Where's that man with
a microwave on his head?

700
00:48:12,333 --> 00:48:13,372
What?

701
00:48:13,825 --> 00:48:15,146
What's wrong with us?

702
00:48:22,732 --> 00:48:25,590
'I thought only you were a joker.'

703
00:48:25,677 --> 00:48:27,841
'But your dad is a bigger joker.'

704
00:48:34,357 --> 00:48:36,724
He said that my calculation
was wrong.

705
00:48:37,310 --> 00:48:38,708
He even made fun of my dad.

706
00:48:38,918 --> 00:48:40,636
I warned him repeatedly,
but he did not stop.

707
00:48:40,716 --> 00:48:42,302
So, I beat him to death.

708
00:48:44,036 --> 00:48:45,395
Him?
- Anand.

709
00:48:45,802 --> 00:48:46,810
Anand?

710
00:48:50,318 --> 00:48:51,864
Who is Anand? Your class friend?

711
00:48:54,521 --> 00:48:55,677
Isn't he Anand?

712
00:49:12,423 --> 00:49:14,680
No, he isn't Anand.

713
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:18,358
Isn't he Anand?

714
00:49:21,889 --> 00:49:22,889
Hey!

715
00:49:24,030 --> 00:49:25,288
Didn't we come in the car?

716
00:49:26,132 --> 00:49:27,210
We came by bike.

717
00:49:27,882 --> 00:49:29,905
We came in the car.

718
00:49:30,030 --> 00:49:31,702
We came on a bike.
Look, it's over there.

719
00:49:33,045 --> 00:49:34,084
So, whose car is that?

720
00:49:37,218 --> 00:49:38,218
I remember.

721
00:49:38,608 --> 00:49:41,538
You and I were speeding on the bike

722
00:49:41,663 --> 00:49:44,116
and suddenly, a man came in
this car and bumped into us.

723
00:49:44,351 --> 00:49:45,515
Correct.

724
00:49:46,054 --> 00:49:47,812
He came in the car
and ran over our bike.

725
00:49:48,038 --> 00:49:49,038
Yes, that's right.

726
00:49:49,296 --> 00:49:51,016
He came in the car
and bumped into our bike.

727
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:55,100
Nonsense!

728
00:49:55,327 --> 00:49:56,710
It's utter rubbish!

729
00:50:00,179 --> 00:50:02,397
How can someone come
in a car and...

730
00:50:04,968 --> 00:50:06,132
Gosh!

731
00:50:06,804 --> 00:50:08,772
We have this dead body.

732
00:50:09,374 --> 00:50:11,226
And a car that has no wheel.

733
00:50:11,655 --> 00:50:15,342
That bike... - We have a car,
a bike and a deadbody.

734
00:50:15,601 --> 00:50:17,241
But none of the three
are of any use.

735
00:50:17,601 --> 00:50:18,819
First, clear that.

736
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:22,085
Shall we bury him?

737
00:50:23,663 --> 00:50:25,062
But we don't have a spade to dig.

738
00:50:25,288 --> 00:50:26,882
It's better to burn him.

739
00:50:27,585 --> 00:50:29,054
Correct, let us burn him.

740
00:50:29,241 --> 00:50:30,241
Oh...

741
00:50:32,550 --> 00:50:33,866
Hey!

742
00:50:34,624 --> 00:50:36,210
Aren't you a deadbody?

743
00:50:36,663 --> 00:50:37,788
Lie down at one place.

744
00:50:38,929 --> 00:50:40,015
Velu...

745
00:50:40,147 --> 00:50:42,327
Look over there. Do you see
those two fellows?

746
00:50:44,952 --> 00:50:49,093
Sir, two men are standing idle
under this hot sun.

747
00:50:49,421 --> 00:50:51,687
You are asking me if I can see them.

748
00:50:52,069 --> 00:50:54,177
You couldn't see them
when they fled on a bike that day.

749
00:50:54,257 --> 00:50:55,663
They weren't there.

750
00:50:55,851 --> 00:50:57,093
Now, they are really here.

751
00:50:57,265 --> 00:50:59,358
Sir, it's really difficult
to handle you.

752
00:50:59,601 --> 00:51:02,163
Sir, of course, I can see
the ones who are present.

753
00:51:02,327 --> 00:51:03,976
And those who aren't,
I cannot see them.

754
00:51:04,108 --> 00:51:06,296
How can I say otherwise?

755
00:51:06,483 --> 00:51:08,499
You want me to say what
you want to hear.

756
00:51:09,296 --> 00:51:10,866
Are they here or not?

757
00:51:11,202 --> 00:51:13,757
What do you want me to say,
they are here or not?

758
00:51:40,389 --> 00:51:42,358
Hey...
- Anand...

759
00:51:42,514 --> 00:51:44,460
He isn't listening to me.
Kill him. - Catch him.

760
00:51:48,835 --> 00:51:51,132
Sir, he is bulky.

761
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:52,835
So what? Catch him.

762
00:51:54,444 --> 00:51:56,452
Catch him, I say!

763
00:51:56,686 --> 00:51:58,624
Oh...

764
00:52:10,030 --> 00:52:12,467
No, not there!
- I know you.

765
00:52:12,663 --> 00:52:14,577
What are you doing there?

766
00:52:14,717 --> 00:52:16,639
I am not doing anything, sir.

767
00:52:16,983 --> 00:52:19,022
He is the one in action, sir.

768
00:52:19,178 --> 00:52:21,327
Hey...
- Catch him.

769
00:52:22,085 --> 00:52:23,577
Will you catch him?

770
00:52:25,483 --> 00:52:26,662
Handcuff him.

771
00:52:27,139 --> 00:52:28,217
Come on, do it.

772
00:52:28,538 --> 00:52:29,538
Handcuff him.

773
00:52:30,757 --> 00:52:32,061
No!

774
00:52:32,194 --> 00:52:33,522
Handcuff him.

775
00:52:33,811 --> 00:52:36,835
Come here, handcuff him.

776
00:52:37,264 --> 00:52:39,319
Hey, why are you handcuffing me?

777
00:52:39,936 --> 00:52:41,772
Velu!

778
00:52:46,491 --> 00:52:47,491
Sir...

779
00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:18,053
Come, let us go.

780
00:53:22,366 --> 00:53:23,889
Sir...

781
00:55:16,604 --> 00:55:17,604
Sir...

782
00:55:20,753 --> 00:55:21,753
Sir...

783
00:55:24,870 --> 00:55:25,870
Sir...

784
00:55:27,761 --> 00:55:28,761
Sir...

785
00:55:34,152 --> 00:55:35,152
Sir...

786
00:55:36,128 --> 00:55:37,206
Sir...

787
00:55:41,105 --> 00:55:43,113
You eye on others' wives.

788
00:55:43,722 --> 00:55:46,933
You got me married to a girl
who is five years older than me.

789
00:55:47,441 --> 00:55:49,347
But you make merry with her.

790
00:55:49,644 --> 00:55:50,855
For example,

791
00:55:51,144 --> 00:55:52,605
Sachin Tendulkar's wife

792
00:55:52,839 --> 00:55:54,495
is five years older than him.

793
00:55:54,753 --> 00:55:56,199
Aren't they happy?

794
00:55:57,183 --> 00:55:58,878
You asked me a question
very often.

795
00:55:59,206 --> 00:56:00,964
Why do I drink?

796
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:02,683
I drink because of you.

797
00:56:03,698 --> 00:56:05,901
You thought I was unaware
of all this.

798
00:56:06,519 --> 00:56:07,863
I know it very well.

799
00:56:08,113 --> 00:56:10,792
You used me as a pawn so that
you could have fun with my wife.

800
00:56:11,738 --> 00:56:15,128
This is what will happen
if you eye other man's wife.

801
00:56:15,972 --> 00:56:16,972
And...

802
00:56:43,331 --> 00:56:44,331
Velu...

803
00:56:44,652 --> 00:56:46,019
What were you doing?

804
00:56:46,870 --> 00:56:48,519
Sir, I was checking if

805
00:56:48,667 --> 00:56:51,089
they went this side
or escaped to that side.

806
00:56:51,464 --> 00:56:52,855
Don't lie to me, Velu.

807
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:54,706
Weren't you dancing?

808
00:56:54,878 --> 00:56:55,878
No, sir.

809
00:56:55,964 --> 00:56:58,972
I was really checking which side
the two of them could've gone.

810
00:56:59,378 --> 00:57:00,908
What are you holding
in your hand? - The key.

811
00:57:00,988 --> 00:57:02,058
Come and unlock me.

812
00:57:05,144 --> 00:57:07,472
They beat me up till I bled.

813
00:57:07,714 --> 00:57:09,018
How are you fit and fine?

814
00:57:09,253 --> 00:57:12,518
Sir, it's been 15 years since
Simran got married.

815
00:57:12,638 --> 00:57:13,671
You're asking me now.

816
00:57:13,864 --> 00:57:14,864
What are you blabbering?

817
00:57:14,972 --> 00:57:17,163
The two of them escaped. I asked
why you didn't catch them.

818
00:57:17,243 --> 00:57:18,306
And you're talking senseless things.

819
00:57:18,386 --> 00:57:21,206
Sir, it's been a week since there
is no water supply at my house.

820
00:57:21,370 --> 00:57:23,136
Velu, why are you talking
so irrelevant?

821
00:57:23,534 --> 00:57:26,550
Simran got married, there is no
water supply! What do you imply?

822
00:57:26,808 --> 00:57:29,331
Sir, why are you talking like this?

823
00:57:29,902 --> 00:57:32,066
You were hit on your head.

824
00:57:32,238 --> 00:57:33,678
I think that is why
you are confused.

825
00:57:33,863 --> 00:57:35,956
Sir, don't bother about
their escape.

826
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:37,261
We can catch them tomorrow.

827
00:57:37,566 --> 00:57:39,003
Your health is more
important to me.

828
00:57:39,167 --> 00:57:40,010
Come, sir.

829
00:57:40,167 --> 00:57:41,792
Come on, sir.

830
00:57:49,503 --> 00:57:50,503
Hey!

831
00:57:51,831 --> 00:57:53,542
Who are you?

832
00:57:54,667 --> 00:57:55,690
What's your name?

833
00:57:56,636 --> 00:57:58,253
How are you connected to them?

834
00:57:58,769 --> 00:57:59,824
Who are you?

835
00:58:00,284 --> 00:58:01,550
What's your name?

836
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:03,777
How are you connected to them?

837
00:58:04,042 --> 00:58:05,339
I am a policeman.

838
00:58:05,628 --> 00:58:06,949
I am a policeman.

839
00:58:07,277 --> 00:58:10,308
Sir, why are you repeating
his words?

840
00:58:10,472 --> 00:58:12,917
He is repeating my words.

841
00:58:13,238 --> 00:58:14,238
You stay quiet.

842
00:58:15,205 --> 00:58:16,370
Whose car is that?

843
00:58:16,644 --> 00:58:17,972
Whose car is that?

844
00:58:25,839 --> 00:58:26,949
Why are you laughing?

845
00:58:27,019 --> 00:58:28,449
Sir, I am not laughing.

846
00:58:28,542 --> 00:58:31,402
I'm crying on your pitiable state.

847
00:58:59,816 --> 00:59:01,839
It's your dad.
Want to speak?

848
00:59:10,113 --> 00:59:13,714
How will they handcuff a thief
who has only one hand?

849
00:59:15,214 --> 00:59:16,925
Didn't human come out of an ape?

850
00:59:17,144 --> 00:59:19,417
So then the monkeys now...

851
00:59:19,628 --> 00:59:22,480
Have they decided from when
will they start becoming humans?

852
00:59:23,027 --> 00:59:24,878
Why did they stop becoming
humans? Answer me.

853
00:59:29,824 --> 00:59:30,941
He is calling again.

854
00:59:31,277 --> 00:59:32,378
Want to speak?

855
01:00:04,514 --> 01:00:07,316
It's your father again.
He is repeatedly calling.

856
01:00:07,456 --> 01:00:10,284
Either take his call
or I will break this phone.

857
01:00:10,386 --> 01:00:12,800
Let me warn you. I'm going to
relieve myself. I'll be back.

858
01:00:25,527 --> 01:00:26,527
Hello.

859
01:00:27,011 --> 01:00:29,300
Do you want to know where I am,
whenever I go out?

860
01:00:29,636 --> 01:00:31,675
Why do you keep calling
and irritating me?

861
01:00:32,409 --> 01:00:34,027
Don't you understand
if I say it once?

862
01:00:34,683 --> 01:00:35,683
Disconnect the line.

863
01:00:37,175 --> 01:00:40,699
Your dad slipped and fell
in the morning.

864
01:00:41,034 --> 01:00:43,839
When I went to help him get up,
he didn't.

865
01:01:43,991 --> 01:01:44,991
Hey!

866
01:01:45,350 --> 01:01:46,756
If I was in your place,

867
01:01:46,936 --> 01:01:50,006
I would've left by now to see
that man for one last time.

868
01:01:50,795 --> 01:01:51,795
Let's go, dude.

869
01:01:57,201 --> 01:01:58,311
I am talking to you.

870
01:02:00,014 --> 01:02:01,366
What do you want
me to do?

871
01:02:01,490 --> 01:02:03,248
Do I leave all this and
mourn for my loss?

872
01:02:07,373 --> 01:02:09,576
Whether I go or not,
the funeral will happen.

873
01:02:14,561 --> 01:02:17,264
Agreed! My father has died.
What can be done?

874
01:02:19,553 --> 01:02:22,662
Even if I go, few people will
mourn with me. What next?

875
01:02:26,451 --> 01:02:29,100
Mourning for the dead is just
to appease the society.

876
01:02:30,756 --> 01:02:32,530
It won't bring
him back to life.

877
01:02:37,209 --> 01:02:38,451
It is a 20 year old dream.

878
01:02:39,639 --> 01:02:41,780
Going to Mars was
his only ambition.

879
01:02:45,491 --> 01:02:48,319
Fulfilling his dream is the
befitting funeral I can give him.

880
01:02:53,100 --> 01:02:54,795
I maybe his adopted son,

881
01:02:56,155 --> 01:02:57,311
but he is still my father!

882
01:03:06,014 --> 01:03:07,195
Adopted son?

883
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:26,569
I feel like taking a drag.

884
01:04:38,573 --> 01:04:39,940
Do you have
anything left?

885
01:05:50,073 --> 01:05:51,393
'Hotel Chola, sir!'

886
01:05:51,713 --> 01:05:54,963
'Our PC informed that your
bike is parked outside Hotel Chola.'

887
01:05:55,151 --> 01:05:57,666
Dude, do you know
where Hotel Chola is?

888
01:05:59,557 --> 01:06:02,104
'Sir, look around and give
me some landmark!'

889
01:06:03,354 --> 01:06:05,275
Sir, we are on a road.

890
01:06:05,424 --> 01:06:08,291
'Sir, road is quite generic.
Tell me what you see on road.'

891
01:06:08,635 --> 01:06:10,666
There is a huge
Tamarind tree here, sir.

892
01:06:10,862 --> 01:06:12,973
Dude, this road is full of
Tamarind trees.

893
01:06:13,028 --> 01:06:15,888
'Sir, don't test my patience.
Give me some landmark.'

894
01:06:16,169 --> 01:06:18,052
I can see a temple nearby.

895
01:06:18,231 --> 01:06:20,122
Lord Murugan's temple
I presume. - 'Yup!'

896
01:06:20,208 --> 01:06:22,083
'You're closeby. Pull over
the jeep.' - Hey!

897
01:06:22,849 --> 01:06:25,489
Hey, stop the cart.
- 'Sir, have you reached?'

898
01:06:25,731 --> 01:06:26,536
Yes!

899
01:06:26,794 --> 01:06:30,114
'Don't take the jeep in. The party
might notice. Park it outside.'

900
01:06:30,605 --> 01:06:32,387
Hey, this is the spot.
Stop here.

901
01:06:34,263 --> 01:06:35,833
Oops! - Sir, please pay
the fare!

902
01:06:36,020 --> 01:06:37,403
Dude, I am a Police.

903
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:38,708
Stop kidding me.

904
01:06:38,927 --> 01:06:41,442
Just admit that you don't
have money. I'll let go.

905
01:06:41,575 --> 01:06:43,169
Like I'll believe
you are a cop.

906
01:06:44,997 --> 01:06:47,583
No one respects me
without the uniform.

907
01:06:48,192 --> 01:06:49,997
Why? Do I not look
like a Police?

908
01:06:50,145 --> 01:06:51,349
No, sir.
- What?

909
01:06:51,442 --> 01:06:54,809
I mean I don't know
why he said so, sir.

910
01:07:14,176 --> 01:07:16,324
The local Police was right, sir.

911
01:07:16,450 --> 01:07:17,629
Our bike is here.

912
01:07:18,248 --> 01:07:19,444
Fine! If the bike is here

913
01:07:19,803 --> 01:07:21,092
they must also be here.

914
01:07:21,319 --> 01:07:22,694
Let's go check!

915
01:07:30,053 --> 01:07:31,662
In which room are the two men

916
01:07:31,772 --> 01:07:33,436
in this photo staying?

917
01:07:35,819 --> 01:07:38,888
Sir, they are the owners of this
place and died 13 years ago.

918
01:07:38,936 --> 01:07:40,256
I'm asking about these two.

919
01:07:41,123 --> 01:07:43,936
Sir, I just came to work and
I don't have these details.

920
01:07:44,764 --> 01:07:45,568
Check the register.

921
01:07:45,825 --> 01:07:48,775
Sir, I can't show the
register to random people.

922
01:07:49,455 --> 01:07:50,502
Call your owner!

923
01:07:50,572 --> 01:07:52,353
But their owner died
13 years ago.

924
01:07:52,454 --> 01:07:53,258
Hold on, dude.

925
01:07:53,459 --> 01:07:54,473
Call the incumbent owner.

926
01:07:54,606 --> 01:07:56,529
I don't see the owner.
Only he is here.

927
01:07:56,606 --> 01:07:58,532
Just shut up!
Call your owner now.

928
01:07:58,743 --> 01:08:00,016
Sir, who are you?

929
01:08:00,384 --> 01:08:01,524
Chennai Police.

930
01:08:02,321 --> 01:08:03,797
Cop? Can I see
your ID card?

931
01:08:03,868 --> 01:08:06,282
The two men in this photo
thrashed him and took it away.

932
01:08:07,095 --> 01:08:08,759
No jeep!
No ID!

933
01:08:08,891 --> 01:08:11,243
No baton! No uniform!
Just a big tummy!

934
01:08:21,587 --> 01:08:22,884
I sent 20 messages

935
01:08:23,141 --> 01:08:26,149
from your phone, dude. I sent
a text mentioning that I am

936
01:08:26,423 --> 01:08:29,274
Andava Perumal and that I feel bad
for not being part of the show.

937
01:08:29,509 --> 01:08:31,149
I asked them to send
me the location.

938
01:08:31,360 --> 01:08:33,080
I said it's fine even if
I don't get to sing

939
01:08:33,173 --> 01:08:35,282
and would like to
watch them perform.

940
01:08:35,501 --> 01:08:36,501
This is all I sent.

941
01:08:38,180 --> 01:08:39,524
I sent it 20 times, dude.

942
01:08:40,110 --> 01:08:42,446
But I didn't get any reply.
Not even a single response.

943
01:08:42,751 --> 01:08:45,415
He's sent me the location now,
just for the heck of it.

944
01:08:45,641 --> 01:08:47,595
He dares to send location
to Andava Perumal.

945
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:02,040
Come in, sir.

946
01:09:03,345 --> 01:09:06,962
Gosh! What do you think you are
doing, dude? Buddy!

947
01:09:07,267 --> 01:09:09,564
Hey, step down! - Sir, look at
what he is doing!

948
01:09:09,728 --> 01:09:11,228
Hey, who are you?

949
01:09:11,955 --> 01:09:13,384
Hey, do you know
who he is?

950
01:09:15,041 --> 01:09:16,181
Police, dude!

951
01:09:16,993 --> 01:09:18,462
So? Don't you have
any sense?

952
01:09:18,603 --> 01:09:20,375
Can't you see the 'Do not
disturb' sign on the door?

953
01:09:20,455 --> 01:09:23,392
I am not killing either of
you or some random man.

954
01:09:23,494 --> 01:09:24,986
I am ending my life.

955
01:09:25,259 --> 01:09:26,900
This is basic
human rights, dude.

956
01:09:26,978 --> 01:09:28,853
I don't like living here.

957
01:09:28,986 --> 01:09:30,466
Do you follow?
How does it bother you?

958
01:09:31,298 --> 01:09:34,392
How dare you disrespect us!
Rascal! I'll kill you!

959
01:09:34,548 --> 01:09:37,400
If you want to end your life,
why didn't you do it two hours ago?

960
01:09:37,634 --> 01:09:40,376
Why do it when I am in charge?
Look, sir. He wants to die

961
01:09:40,478 --> 01:09:41,998
with the ID!
- File a case on him, sir.

962
01:09:42,088 --> 01:09:45,213
He's barged into my room and
invades my privacy! File a case.

963
01:09:45,384 --> 01:09:46,291
Why me?

964
01:09:46,423 --> 01:09:48,088
Sir, file a case on
him now. - Sir!

965
01:09:48,236 --> 01:09:49,486
What is he saying?

966
01:09:50,353 --> 01:09:52,041
Sir, what is he saying?
- Get lost!

967
01:09:53,377 --> 01:09:56,072
Have you seen the two
men in this photo? - Go away, sir.

968
01:09:56,345 --> 01:09:57,463
Don't show me all this.

969
01:10:03,408 --> 01:10:05,853
Fraud! Fraud! Fraud!
They are big time frauds, sir.

970
01:10:06,127 --> 01:10:08,697
Why should I look at a fraud's
face before dying, sir?

971
01:10:08,884 --> 01:10:11,267
Sir, committing suicide
isn't easy!

972
01:10:11,634 --> 01:10:14,571
Please go, sir. I've lost the
will to die. I am upset.

973
01:10:14,783 --> 01:10:16,775
I'll find another place to die.
- Sorry, sir.

974
01:10:16,923 --> 01:10:18,830
Actually I've a doubt, sir.

975
01:10:19,080 --> 01:10:22,572
The suicide guy said he plans
to take his life, but - Sir! Sir!

976
01:10:22,728 --> 01:10:24,150
Didn't tell the reason.
- Sir! Sir!

977
01:10:24,369 --> 01:10:25,650
He is rushing out, sir.

978
01:10:25,838 --> 01:10:28,318
What if he attempts suicide
in another room? Please come, sir.

979
01:10:29,088 --> 01:10:31,720
I don't care. Go away.
Get out of my sight.

980
01:10:34,650 --> 01:10:36,267
Dude, where are you going?

981
01:10:37,563 --> 01:10:38,571
Come here!

982
01:10:41,408 --> 01:10:42,822
Why did you come?

983
01:10:43,127 --> 01:10:44,572
You're such a pain, sir.

984
01:10:46,478 --> 01:10:47,377
Why did you go?

985
01:10:47,494 --> 01:10:50,119
You asked us to get
out of your sight, sir.

986
01:10:50,283 --> 01:10:51,767
Will you just blindly follow?

987
01:10:52,368 --> 01:10:53,227
Use your brains!

988
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:54,400
Look!

989
01:10:54,556 --> 01:10:56,548
This suicide plot is
just a diversion.

990
01:10:56,759 --> 01:10:58,736
He has some connection
with these two men.

991
01:10:58,916 --> 01:11:02,087
So, I'm quite sure that they
are staying in this hotel.

992
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:06,244
Let's check every room in this
hotel. We can definitely nab them.

993
01:11:06,916 --> 01:11:09,150
I'm feeling bored. Give me
the keys. I'll leave.

994
01:11:11,588 --> 01:11:12,588
I need the keys!

995
01:11:19,603 --> 01:11:22,416
You don't own the liquor or
the bike! Do you follow?

996
01:11:55,111 --> 01:11:56,166
20 years!

997
01:11:56,338 --> 01:11:58,447
You've been aspiring to go to
Mars for over 20 years.

998
01:11:58,806 --> 01:11:59,837
Can you deny?

999
01:12:02,236 --> 01:12:03,408
I also have dreams.

1000
01:12:04,673 --> 01:12:05,775
My band!

1001
01:12:06,470 --> 01:12:07,571
I want to perform

1002
01:12:08,244 --> 01:12:09,267
before everyone!

1003
01:12:10,447 --> 01:12:11,447
I am unable to.

1004
01:12:18,572 --> 01:12:19,736
You'll never understand.

1005
01:12:20,275 --> 01:12:21,275
Not a chance.

1006
01:12:29,236 --> 01:12:31,306
Four blocks, seven floors.

1007
01:12:31,463 --> 01:12:33,353
228 rooms in total.

1008
01:12:33,673 --> 01:12:35,158
We should check
every room.

1009
01:12:36,056 --> 01:12:38,752
Hey! - I guess we'll take a week
to cover this corridor.

1010
01:12:38,822 --> 01:12:40,078
Go! - No! - When do we
begin with rooms?

1011
01:12:40,158 --> 01:12:42,541
What did I do?
- I won't let you. - Gosh!

1012
01:12:42,775 --> 01:12:45,095
Don't run! - Their fight
is never ending.

1013
01:12:45,306 --> 01:12:47,603
How do we handle
the suicide case, sir?

1014
01:12:48,041 --> 01:12:49,775
Let's just focus on
our assignment.

1015
01:12:49,892 --> 01:12:51,095
Okay! Carry on.

1016
01:12:54,166 --> 01:12:55,658
Hey!
- Fool!

1017
01:12:56,658 --> 01:12:57,658
Sir!

1018
01:12:58,055 --> 01:12:59,055
Bar!

1019
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:01,064
Are you here to drink
or nab the convicts?

1020
01:13:01,236 --> 01:13:03,041
Of course to nab
the convicts.

1021
01:13:03,150 --> 01:13:05,111
Why do want to
drink then? - No, sir.

1022
01:13:05,338 --> 01:13:06,775
Keep it low!
- Such a pain.

1023
01:13:07,423 --> 01:13:09,025
Let's discuss our plan
over drinks.

1024
01:13:09,338 --> 01:13:12,548
I know you plan on getting drunk.
But I am not falling for it.

1025
01:13:12,662 --> 01:13:14,685
Sir! - Excuse me.
- Yes please!

1026
01:13:15,779 --> 01:13:16,865
Hey!

1027
01:13:17,029 --> 01:13:18,193
Don't you want
to nab them?

1028
01:13:18,373 --> 01:13:21,826
Do you think the convicts will
have drinks at a public bar?

1029
01:13:22,380 --> 01:13:23,380
Correct, sir.

1030
01:13:23,748 --> 01:13:26,037
He wouldn't be puking
if he had got the

1031
01:13:26,427 --> 01:13:28,974
mix of soda and alcohol right.
Am I correct?

1032
01:13:29,662 --> 01:13:30,810
We got to check.

1033
01:13:31,044 --> 01:13:32,076
Wait! Let me call him.

1034
01:13:32,162 --> 01:13:33,584
Dude!
- Hey!

1035
01:13:33,873 --> 01:13:35,654
I mean let's go
check every room.

1036
01:13:45,826 --> 01:13:46,740
This won't suffice!

1037
01:13:46,849 --> 01:13:48,248
Hey, fetch me another round!

1038
01:13:52,248 --> 01:13:53,302
Hey buddies!

1039
01:13:53,490 --> 01:13:55,255
You won't kill
even if I beg you to.

1040
01:13:55,427 --> 01:13:57,255
Why are the cops looking
for you? - Cops?

1041
01:13:57,529 --> 01:14:00,404
Yes! The Police are
looking for you!

1042
01:14:00,716 --> 01:14:01,896
Give me
some water.

1043
01:14:03,341 --> 01:14:05,427
Just a glass of water.
Why do you glare at me?

1044
01:14:05,529 --> 01:14:07,076
What did the
Police ask you?

1045
01:14:07,998 --> 01:14:10,412
"Why do you refuse to
give water?" - Water!

1046
01:14:10,505 --> 01:14:12,724
"Are you from the
neighboring state?"

1047
01:14:13,076 --> 01:14:15,685
"Though they give in,
they don't let go of it!"

1048
01:14:15,794 --> 01:14:18,255
'Water! Water!' - I am asking you!
Why are you singing?

1049
01:14:18,435 --> 01:14:20,365
Stop singing and answer me.
- 'Oh water!'

1050
01:14:20,763 --> 01:14:23,037
What did the Police want?
- Answer us! - 'Oh water!'

1051
01:14:23,334 --> 01:14:25,333
How can you say I
didn't get my target?

1052
01:14:25,513 --> 01:14:27,568
I've done 45 in place of 25.
What more do you need?

1053
01:14:27,896 --> 01:14:29,318
I think he mistook
us for someone.

1054
01:14:29,490 --> 01:14:32,232
Don't call yourself a Team Leader.
You are not Malhotra

1055
01:14:32,537 --> 01:14:33,537
Let go!

1056
01:14:33,904 --> 01:14:36,240
Have I ever shirked off
from work? 10 years!

1057
01:14:36,474 --> 01:14:39,443
I've slogged hard
carrying out your orders.

1058
01:14:39,482 --> 01:14:40,584
'What did the cops ask?'

1059
01:14:40,693 --> 01:14:43,076
Supervisor's pet becomes manager.
Manager's favorite becomes

1060
01:14:43,154 --> 01:14:44,478
Team Lead. Team
Lead's choice goes

1061
01:14:44,518 --> 01:14:46,194
on-site. Sincere workers
like me lose out.

1062
01:14:46,724 --> 01:14:48,029
What did the cops want? - Hey!

1063
01:14:48,185 --> 01:14:49,951
Malhotra, don't say another word.

1064
01:14:50,365 --> 01:14:52,481
I'll hit you with this bottle.
It's my time now.

1065
01:14:53,075 --> 01:14:56,067
If only an IT employee gets a chance
to speak to the Team Lead

1066
01:14:56,318 --> 01:14:59,029
directly, I'm sure they
will rip him apart.

1067
01:14:59,216 --> 01:15:01,068
IT company!
My foot!

1068
01:15:01,849 --> 01:15:03,294
My death

1069
01:15:03,451 --> 01:15:05,865
will serve as a trigger
for every IT employee!

1070
01:15:11,287 --> 01:15:12,318
We don't have
much time, sir.

1071
01:15:12,388 --> 01:15:15,138
Let's ask them to install
CCTV in every room!

1072
01:15:15,388 --> 01:15:16,693
What do you think, sir?

1073
01:15:17,310 --> 01:15:18,716
English?
- Yeah!

1074
01:15:19,630 --> 01:15:21,739
CCTV is not a bulb to be
fixed as and when

1075
01:15:21,818 --> 01:15:23,107
you please!
- Sorry, sir.

1076
01:15:23,372 --> 01:15:24,372
Sir!

1077
01:15:27,753 --> 01:15:29,582
Something is not right!
- Correct, sir.

1078
01:15:29,912 --> 01:15:31,935
Those shades do not
look good on them.

1079
01:15:44,271 --> 01:15:45,310
Hey Velu!

1080
01:15:45,904 --> 01:15:47,373
How many heads
do you see?

1081
01:15:47,529 --> 01:15:49,409
Are you asking about
the first time or now, sir?

1082
01:15:49,771 --> 01:15:50,779
Second time?

1083
01:15:50,959 --> 01:15:51,959
One!

1084
01:15:52,209 --> 01:15:53,669
What about first time?
- Two!

1085
01:16:15,427 --> 01:16:17,037
Hey, you are already late.

1086
01:16:17,435 --> 01:16:18,638
Get the parcel!

1087
01:16:18,881 --> 01:16:20,646
Hold on!
Velu!

1088
01:16:21,138 --> 01:16:23,592
You say that you can hear even
what people don't say out loud.

1089
01:16:23,873 --> 01:16:25,342
Can you repeat whatever
he just said?

1090
01:16:25,489 --> 01:16:27,333
I didn't hear
him clearly, sir.

1091
01:16:27,490 --> 01:16:28,763
Can you ask
him to repeat?

1092
01:16:29,427 --> 01:16:31,052
You are Ramalingam's man.
Am I right?

1093
01:16:31,295 --> 01:16:32,951
Answer me!
- Hold on!

1094
01:16:33,677 --> 01:16:35,037
You don't have
to repeat all of it.

1095
01:16:35,185 --> 01:16:36,467
Just say the last
three words.

1096
01:16:36,552 --> 01:16:38,201
Did Ramalingam
send you here?

1097
01:16:38,342 --> 01:16:40,396
Ramalingam, dude.
Professor Ramalingam.

1098
01:16:40,482 --> 01:16:42,857
Hey! Hey! He's not a
professor or priest.

1099
01:16:43,115 --> 01:16:45,488
Just get the Rs 3 Million worth drug
out of his stomach, dude.

1100
01:16:45,568 --> 01:16:48,467
Just get the Rs 3 Million worth drug
out of his stomach, dude.

1101
01:16:48,545 --> 01:16:50,599
Hey Velu, Professor Ramalingam!

1102
01:16:50,732 --> 01:16:53,224
Akash's father. Where
is Akash? Tell me.

1103
01:16:53,537 --> 01:16:55,917
Ramalingam assured me that
though you don't look

1104
01:16:55,957 --> 01:16:58,131
like a physician, you
are a genius at work.

1105
01:16:58,349 --> 01:17:00,271
Are you not that guy?
Answer me!

1106
01:17:00,388 --> 01:17:01,584
Are you not the one?

1107
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:03,084
Are you kidding me?

1108
01:17:03,248 --> 01:17:05,021
Dude, do something!
Get the stock out.

1109
01:17:05,193 --> 01:17:07,092
Dude, do something!
Get the stock out.

1110
01:17:07,248 --> 01:17:08,513
What do you want
me to do?

1111
01:17:08,654 --> 01:17:11,802
Please get it out of me, sir.
- Do something.

1112
01:17:32,670 --> 01:17:33,935
Get it out of me, sir.

1113
01:17:34,068 --> 01:17:35,802
Get him to take a dump
and deliver stock!

1114
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:36,920
Stop it!

1115
01:17:40,521 --> 01:17:43,505
Do I look like someone
who induces poop?

1116
01:17:49,271 --> 01:17:50,576
105!

1117
01:17:50,989 --> 01:17:52,271
106!
- Sir!

1118
01:17:52,443 --> 01:17:53,443
Didn't you ask for 107?

1119
01:17:53,506 --> 01:17:54,709
Yes! 107!
- Come in!

1120
01:18:00,693 --> 01:18:01,693
Sir!

1121
01:18:01,935 --> 01:18:02,935
Sir!

1122
01:18:03,506 --> 01:18:06,107
Gosh! They've brutally
attacked a cop! Sir!

1123
01:18:08,537 --> 01:18:10,388
Do I have to get this
man to take a dump?

1124
01:18:10,638 --> 01:18:12,592
Poor thing! They've
attacked his head!

1125
01:18:12,959 --> 01:18:15,119
How can you get someone to
poop by hitting on the head?

1126
01:18:15,592 --> 01:18:17,326
Who are you, dude?

1127
01:18:17,693 --> 01:18:19,427
I am physician
Vaithyalingam.

1128
01:18:19,873 --> 01:18:21,154
Hopeless!

1129
01:18:21,459 --> 01:18:22,906
They mistook me for
you and beat me.

1130
01:18:22,946 --> 01:18:24,513
- But you can't pass
through the head.

1131
01:18:24,756 --> 01:18:25,974
Take a look at
my wound!

1132
01:18:26,138 --> 01:18:28,076
Don't I have to give you
tablets for excretion?

1133
01:18:28,318 --> 01:18:30,623
One tight slap!
You'll soil your pants!

1134
01:18:31,021 --> 01:18:32,021
Treat my wound!

1135
01:18:44,746 --> 01:18:46,629
I don't care what you do!

1136
01:18:46,848 --> 01:18:47,848
But I need a bike now.

1137
01:18:48,278 --> 01:18:50,598
Huh? - It's getting late.
I need a bike.

1138
01:18:51,645 --> 01:18:53,668
Do we beat him again
take his bike?

1139
01:18:56,286 --> 01:18:57,489
I'll find another bike.

1140
01:19:04,637 --> 01:19:05,637
Hey!

1141
01:19:05,895 --> 01:19:06,895
Come here!

1142
01:19:08,278 --> 01:19:09,575
Sir, what are you
doing here?

1143
01:19:10,489 --> 01:19:11,567
My God!

1144
01:19:12,043 --> 01:19:14,371
They've literally butchered
your head, sir.

1145
01:19:14,770 --> 01:19:15,973
Where were you?

1146
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:19,996
Sir, I went to call the local Police
as soon as you were in danger.

1147
01:19:21,098 --> 01:19:21,965
Where are they?

1148
01:19:22,082 --> 01:19:24,129
Only after I reached
the station, it struck me

1149
01:19:24,457 --> 01:19:27,246
that it would be a disgrace,
if they see you defeated!

1150
01:19:27,504 --> 01:19:29,629
So, I gave up on my idea
returned to spot.

1151
01:19:29,903 --> 01:19:31,575
Chuck it, sir.
Doesn't matter.

1152
01:19:31,809 --> 01:19:34,270
How do we deal with
this case further?

1153
01:19:35,387 --> 01:19:36,848
The astrologer had warned me

1154
01:19:37,567 --> 01:19:41,051
against taking up new cases
for next three months.

1155
01:19:41,465 --> 01:19:42,559
So?

1156
01:19:43,168 --> 01:19:44,879
We've got the bike.

1157
01:19:45,270 --> 01:19:46,340
Let's get back home!

1158
01:19:47,114 --> 01:19:48,137
Oh sure!

1159
01:19:49,246 --> 01:19:50,246
But if we go back now

1160
01:19:51,207 --> 01:19:52,411
your VRS

1161
01:19:53,286 --> 01:19:54,286
pension

1162
01:19:54,895 --> 01:19:56,012
honor

1163
01:19:56,520 --> 01:19:57,840
all of it will go down the drain!

1164
01:19:58,004 --> 01:19:59,004
Sir!

1165
01:19:59,153 --> 01:20:02,332
You must have a
graceful retirement, sir.

1166
01:20:02,809 --> 01:20:04,450
You deserve this honor!

1167
01:20:05,762 --> 01:20:07,184
What do you want
me to do now?

1168
01:20:07,356 --> 01:20:08,332
Your honor,

1169
01:20:08,418 --> 01:20:10,543
pride and respect
are being dragged

1170
01:20:10,629 --> 01:20:13,629
by Akash and Andava Perumal
to the highways!

1171
01:20:13,848 --> 01:20:16,723
Let's follow them
and revive it all.

1172
01:20:16,926 --> 01:20:20,137
Give it a thought, sir.
Your future is dependent on them.

1173
01:20:30,981 --> 01:20:31,981
Keep going, dude.

1174
01:20:32,161 --> 01:20:34,098
Head straight for 25KMS.

1175
01:20:34,770 --> 01:20:36,051
Google map says so!

1176
01:20:36,332 --> 01:20:39,028
There's still 25KMS left
to reach Concert's destination.

1177
01:20:39,286 --> 01:20:40,590
The Google map specifies

1178
01:20:40,762 --> 01:20:43,161
the distance to our destination.

1179
01:20:49,890 --> 01:20:50,890
You carry on!

1180
01:20:51,374 --> 01:20:52,944
Play to your heart's content.

1181
01:20:55,523 --> 01:20:56,883
I am coming there.

1182
01:20:59,500 --> 01:21:01,085
I'll break your hands first!

1183
01:21:03,781 --> 01:21:04,781
Carry on!

1184
01:21:05,797 --> 01:21:06,797
You keep going, dude.

1185
01:21:07,031 --> 01:21:09,388
Once we reach,
I'll sing!

1186
01:21:10,216 --> 01:21:12,326
We'll defeat the others
and rock the show!

1187
01:21:12,607 --> 01:21:16,404
Do you follow? - We go, we sing,
we conquer, we rock!

1188
01:21:16,646 --> 01:21:18,888
We go, we sing,
we conquer, we rock!

1189
01:21:19,005 --> 01:21:21,076
We go, we sing,
we conquer, we rock!

1190
01:21:21,224 --> 01:21:23,162
We go, we sing,
we conquer, we rock!

1191
01:21:23,255 --> 01:21:25,248
We go, we sing,
we conquer, we rock!

1192
01:21:25,426 --> 01:21:27,403
We go, we sing,
we conquer, we rock!

1193
01:21:27,560 --> 01:21:29,865
We go, we sing,
we conquer, we rock!

1194
01:21:46,943 --> 01:21:48,263
My master has advised me

1195
01:21:49,240 --> 01:21:50,240
Huh?

1196
01:21:50,896 --> 01:21:52,950
That the size of
the audience doesn't matter

1197
01:21:54,201 --> 01:21:55,607
keep up the good work!

1198
01:21:56,724 --> 01:21:57,724
Well said!

1199
01:22:01,435 --> 01:22:03,279
Where we sing,
the kind of audience

1200
01:22:03,521 --> 01:22:06,498
or the number of listeners
does not matter at all!

1201
01:22:07,857 --> 01:22:10,841
What matters is what we
sing and how we perform!

1202
01:22:14,098 --> 01:22:17,036
I never sing
to make others happy.

1203
01:22:17,607 --> 01:22:18,607
Not once!

1204
01:22:18,826 --> 01:22:20,771
I always sing for
my happiness!

1205
01:22:21,982 --> 01:22:23,451
Just to make me happy!

1206
01:22:36,568 --> 01:22:38,568
You've come to
the right spot.

1207
01:22:46,068 --> 01:22:47,255
Don't laugh, buddy!

1208
01:22:51,443 --> 01:22:54,310
I am telling you!
Stop laughing!

1209
01:22:56,231 --> 01:22:57,231
Hey!

1210
01:23:00,045 --> 01:23:01,146
Don't mock me.

1211
01:23:01,615 --> 01:23:04,904
Hey! Don't you hear me?
Stop laughing.

1212
01:23:05,037 --> 01:23:06,873
Hey! Stop laughing!

1213
01:26:39,572 --> 01:26:44,064
"What penance you did?"

1214
01:26:45,321 --> 01:26:48,514
"What penance you did"

1215
01:26:48,811 --> 01:26:52,757
"to beget the universal lord"

1216
01:26:53,030 --> 01:26:56,811
"as your dear son,
Mother Yashoda?"

1217
01:26:56,944 --> 01:27:00,311
"What penance you did"

1218
01:27:00,663 --> 01:27:04,585
"to beget the omnipresent"

1219
01:27:04,882 --> 01:27:08,491
"Lord as your son,
Mother Yashoda?"

1220
01:27:08,632 --> 01:27:11,405
"What penance you did?"

1221
01:27:11,624 --> 01:27:14,366
"What penance you did?"

1222
01:27:14,522 --> 01:27:17,936
"What penance you did?"

1223
01:27:21,327 --> 01:27:25,218
"Mother Yashoda!"

1224
01:28:44,819 --> 01:28:46,413
Hey Velu, ask him!

1225
01:28:46,765 --> 01:28:47,765
Okay!

1226
01:28:49,779 --> 01:28:52,866
Hey, do you serve tea?
My boss wants to know.

1227
01:28:53,022 --> 01:28:54,397
I didn't ask for tea, dude.

1228
01:28:54,616 --> 01:28:55,897
Do I order
a coffee then?

1229
01:28:57,054 --> 01:28:59,866
Show him the photo and
ask if he has seen them here!

1230
01:29:00,015 --> 01:29:01,015
Sure!

1231
01:29:01,179 --> 01:29:03,679
Sir, have you seen these
two men before?

1232
01:29:03,866 --> 01:29:05,093
Did they pass by here?

1233
01:29:05,780 --> 01:29:07,077
Virat Kohli!

1234
01:29:07,374 --> 01:29:08,421
Football player!

1235
01:29:08,515 --> 01:29:10,295
You seem smarter
than my boss!

1236
01:29:10,483 --> 01:29:12,468
Give me the tea!
That's enough! Give it.

1237
01:29:14,108 --> 01:29:15,108
What did he say?

1238
01:29:15,311 --> 01:29:16,663
Sir, he calls him
Virat Kohli.

1239
01:29:16,718 --> 01:29:17,789
Do you want some tea?

1240
01:29:18,921 --> 01:29:19,921
Get lost!

1241
01:29:43,843 --> 01:29:45,843
Have you seen these
two men before?

1242
01:29:46,937 --> 01:29:47,937
Answer me!

1243
01:29:50,913 --> 01:29:51,913
Sir!

1244
01:29:54,835 --> 01:29:56,757
I am conducting the inquiry!

1245
01:29:56,898 --> 01:29:58,390
Why do you rush then?

1246
01:29:58,656 --> 01:30:00,078
Sir, he is a lunatic.

1247
01:30:00,210 --> 01:30:02,203
Don't show all this to him.

1248
01:30:02,406 --> 01:30:04,414
Thank God!
I didn't ask him!

1249
01:30:04,632 --> 01:30:06,046
Can't you do
face reading?

1250
01:30:06,172 --> 01:30:07,797
You are quite
sassy with all this

1251
01:30:07,946 --> 01:30:09,430
but mess up at work!

1252
01:30:09,508 --> 01:30:10,508
Chuck it, sir.

1253
01:30:10,602 --> 01:30:12,403
You must be hungry!
Let's have a bun.

1254
01:30:12,653 --> 01:30:14,208
We have a long day ahead.

1255
01:31:38,394 --> 01:31:41,246
Have you heard of
Daedalus and Icarus story?

1256
01:31:43,496 --> 01:31:45,136
How will you manage
to eat on Mars?

1257
01:31:46,355 --> 01:31:47,753
Do you get food there?

1258
01:31:48,613 --> 01:31:50,035
Tell me!
- Father Daedalus

1259
01:31:50,347 --> 01:31:52,925
and his son Icarus
were imprisoned.

1260
01:31:53,707 --> 01:31:56,113
But Daedalus was a genius!

1261
01:31:56,917 --> 01:31:58,495
He made wings out of wax

1262
01:31:58,777 --> 01:32:00,550
to escape from the prison.

1263
01:32:00,902 --> 01:32:03,102
Is there any connection between
this story and our trek?

1264
01:32:04,722 --> 01:32:05,871
Father and son

1265
01:32:06,207 --> 01:32:08,238
flew out of the
prison soon!

1266
01:32:08,855 --> 01:32:10,652
While flying, the father
warned the son

1267
01:32:11,003 --> 01:32:12,941
against going close
to the sun!

1268
01:32:13,621 --> 01:32:15,777
But the son didn't not
listen to his father.

1269
01:32:16,418 --> 01:32:19,738
So, his wings melted and
he fell to the ground!

1270
01:32:21,574 --> 01:32:24,644
Are you saying the father and son
could fly without getting high?

1271
01:32:26,894 --> 01:32:28,136
My father flew away too!

1272
01:32:28,839 --> 01:32:30,136
Is he dead?
- Nah!

1273
01:32:30,792 --> 01:32:32,323
He ran away
with someone

1274
01:32:32,792 --> 01:32:34,174
and never returned.

1275
01:32:37,692 --> 01:32:41,177
'Did you see that? They've brought
the stock after strong warning!'

1276
01:32:41,560 --> 01:32:44,006
How dare you mess
with our boss?

1277
01:32:44,232 --> 01:32:46,849
He'll cut you out like
'Atho' noodles.

1278
01:32:47,123 --> 01:32:48,123
Get going!

1279
01:32:49,313 --> 01:32:50,485
I asked you to go on!

1280
01:32:50,837 --> 01:32:51,837
Get going!

1281
01:33:01,165 --> 01:33:03,563
What is this, brother? You used
words like Atho', tight!

1282
01:33:03,774 --> 01:33:05,860
You speak both in
English and Tamil.

1283
01:33:06,110 --> 01:33:07,860
I am unable to follow!

1284
01:33:08,103 --> 01:33:09,274
You need more

1285
01:33:09,454 --> 01:33:11,634
exposure for this, dear.

1286
01:33:12,048 --> 01:33:14,267
He says we've got the
stock after warning!

1287
01:33:14,665 --> 01:33:15,907
Who are those guys?

1288
01:33:16,524 --> 01:33:17,634
How will I know?

1289
01:33:25,696 --> 01:33:28,743
Hey, don't tell me that so many
people are eager to go to Mars.

1290
01:33:35,207 --> 01:33:36,535
I didn't say anything wrong.

1291
01:33:36,598 --> 01:33:40,652
I setup business for you at my
cost and send my men to assist you

1292
01:33:40,973 --> 01:33:43,598
whereas you are trying
to make a fool of me!

1293
01:33:44,434 --> 01:33:46,434
Believe me, sir.
I didn't do it.

1294
01:33:46,784 --> 01:33:49,229
No matter how many times you hit
me, my answer remains the same.

1295
01:33:49,309 --> 01:33:50,941
The stock is inside
his stomach!

1296
01:33:51,051 --> 01:33:53,160
Hey, I am not falling
for your tricks.

1297
01:33:53,504 --> 01:33:54,645
You took money
from me.

1298
01:33:54,785 --> 01:33:55,925
Yes, sir!
- How much?

1299
01:33:55,988 --> 01:33:57,394
Rs 3 Million, sir.
- Did you count?

1300
01:33:57,488 --> 01:33:58,949
Yes, sir.
- Was it right?

1301
01:33:59,481 --> 01:34:00,551
Where is the
stock? - Sir!

1302
01:34:00,762 --> 01:34:03,457
Sir, it is inside his stomach.
He is not passing it out.

1303
01:34:03,965 --> 01:34:05,504
We can slit open
and recover it.

1304
01:34:05,847 --> 01:34:08,027
Please slit it open
and take it, sir.

1305
01:34:08,098 --> 01:34:09,470
You are saying I can
slit his stomach

1306
01:34:09,510 --> 01:34:10,737
and take it. - He is lying, sir.

1307
01:34:10,817 --> 01:34:13,675
He has hidden it somewhere.
My stomach is empty.

1308
01:34:13,871 --> 01:34:15,613
Please believe me, sir.

1309
01:34:15,934 --> 01:34:17,621
Hey, don't you dare
mess with me.

1310
01:34:17,770 --> 01:34:19,496
I'll smash you
both to death!

1311
01:34:20,082 --> 01:34:21,082
Excuse me!

1312
01:34:21,176 --> 01:34:22,731
Can you shift this to
the other side?

1313
01:34:22,910 --> 01:34:24,192
I have an important
work here.

1314
01:34:24,566 --> 01:34:26,855
Hey, who are you?

1315
01:34:28,957 --> 01:34:30,410
Wait up!
Hey!

1316
01:34:35,340 --> 01:34:36,527
God is great!

1317
01:34:37,191 --> 01:34:38,106
I can feel God!
- Hey!

1318
01:34:38,199 --> 01:34:39,199
Who are you?

1319
01:34:39,473 --> 01:34:40,863
He is omnipresent!

1320
01:34:41,261 --> 01:34:41,980
Confirmed!

1321
01:34:42,082 --> 01:34:44,221
Hey, how are you
connected to him?

1322
01:34:44,331 --> 01:34:45,573
I don't know
who he is, sir.

1323
01:34:45,862 --> 01:34:46,962
'I blurted out
of fear, sir.'

1324
01:34:47,042 --> 01:34:50,237
Dude, did you get
scared looking at them?

1325
01:34:51,964 --> 01:34:53,417
If I were in your place,

1326
01:34:53,753 --> 01:34:55,034
no one would oppose me.

1327
01:34:55,112 --> 01:34:56,964
I'd have killed
every one of them.

1328
01:34:58,683 --> 01:35:01,636
Just like how you did at your
guitarist friend's house, is it?

1329
01:35:24,440 --> 01:35:25,440
Dude!

1330
01:35:25,651 --> 01:35:28,683
Are you trying to invoke some
spirit to take you to Mars?

1331
01:35:29,784 --> 01:35:31,331
You don't talk about it.

1332
01:35:31,526 --> 01:35:34,128
I know what's on your mind.
Please continue.

1333
01:35:37,933 --> 01:35:38,948
Ouch!

1334
01:35:43,330 --> 01:35:45,182
Dear God!
I'm exhausted.

1335
01:35:45,894 --> 01:35:46,659
Ouch!

1336
01:35:46,964 --> 01:35:50,081
Dude, I've an urgent work here.
Can you clear this spot?

1337
01:35:50,151 --> 01:35:52,127
Hey, you want to die.
Is that all?

1338
01:35:52,214 --> 01:35:53,323
Yes! I want to die.

1339
01:35:53,433 --> 01:35:55,440
I want to jump
off this cliff and die.

1340
01:35:55,558 --> 01:35:57,058
Can you clear out or not?

1341
01:35:57,230 --> 01:35:59,565
You're very unlikely to die
if you jump off here.

1342
01:35:59,675 --> 01:36:02,214
But if you try it
from another spot there...

1343
01:36:02,284 --> 01:36:03,284
Hey!

1344
01:36:03,495 --> 01:36:06,948
I'll decide where to
end my life, not you!

1345
01:36:07,378 --> 01:36:10,003
The wind speed is low here.
You'll get stuck in a tree.

1346
01:36:10,136 --> 01:36:11,355
Further, it is a slope!

1347
01:36:11,542 --> 01:36:13,409
But it is just rocks
on the other side.

1348
01:36:13,620 --> 01:36:16,370
Your head will burst the moment
you land. Death is certain!

1349
01:36:16,620 --> 01:36:18,612
No chances of survival!

1350
01:36:22,425 --> 01:36:23,612
You are a true friend!

1351
01:36:26,948 --> 01:36:28,378
You fatso!

1352
01:36:31,456 --> 01:36:34,221
We can definitely take it.
- I'll do it right away!

1353
01:36:34,433 --> 01:36:35,698
I'll slit his stomach!

1354
01:36:35,792 --> 01:36:38,659
Go on, sir! - Don't, sir.
The stock will get mixed with blood

1355
01:36:38,769 --> 01:36:40,401
and will turn useless.
No gains!

1356
01:36:40,487 --> 01:36:41,487
Please, sir.
- Stop it!

1357
01:36:41,839 --> 01:36:44,315
Earlier, you denied it!
Now, you say it'll get mixed.

1358
01:36:44,487 --> 01:36:45,753
Are you kidding me?
- Excuse me!

1359
01:36:45,987 --> 01:36:46,987
Hello, brothers!

1360
01:36:47,339 --> 01:36:49,034
This spot suits
my requirement.

1361
01:36:49,190 --> 01:36:51,057
Can you move aside?
- Who are you?

1362
01:36:51,636 --> 01:36:53,745
Sorry! I am Karthik Krishnamurthy,
IT employee.

1363
01:36:53,838 --> 01:36:57,369
Hey, are you planning something
by bringing in new people?

1364
01:36:57,535 --> 01:36:58,845
Not at all, sir.
I don't know him.

1365
01:36:58,925 --> 01:37:01,371
I am going to kill
all of you! - Hey!

1366
01:37:01,504 --> 01:37:02,520
How dare you?

1367
01:38:41,246 --> 01:38:43,270
You came here to
end your life.

1368
01:38:43,442 --> 01:38:45,473
You could have just
let him kill you. - Hey!

1369
01:38:45,660 --> 01:38:48,035
I don't trust his skills.
If he had slit my throat,

1370
01:38:48,060 --> 01:38:49,649
I'd have had
a painful death.

1371
01:38:49,797 --> 01:38:52,876
I got a gun
to avoid all this.

1372
01:38:53,735 --> 01:38:54,751
Sigh!

1373
01:38:55,087 --> 01:38:57,297
Hey, you'll die if
you jump from here.

1374
01:38:57,571 --> 01:38:58,977
Hey, you don't understand.

1375
01:38:59,087 --> 01:39:00,946
The speed of wind is
just 20 mph!

1376
01:39:01,016 --> 01:39:02,977
If I jump perpendicularly
at 90 degree, my body

1377
01:39:03,118 --> 01:39:06,251
will flip around. I'll just have
few fractures and not die.

1378
01:39:06,407 --> 01:39:10,016
Instead, if I shot myself, my body
would have hit the ground

1379
01:39:10,117 --> 01:39:12,367
at full gravitational force
and I'd have died.

1380
01:39:16,659 --> 01:39:18,819
He does not know the value of
time. Just keeps talking.

1381
01:39:20,135 --> 01:39:21,401
He came to end his life.

1382
01:39:22,026 --> 01:39:23,158
Let him die!
Dog!

1383
01:39:47,737 --> 01:39:48,995
You'll burn to death!

1384
01:39:49,143 --> 01:39:51,417
I am not responsible for you.
So, get back!

1385
01:39:55,010 --> 01:39:57,034
I am sure you aimed
the stone at me

1386
01:39:57,565 --> 01:39:59,268
with an intent to kill!

1387
01:40:00,643 --> 01:40:02,338
Tell me the truth!
- I don't know.

1388
01:40:03,682 --> 01:40:04,682
Maybe!

1389
01:40:05,354 --> 01:40:06,510
You are lying!

1390
01:40:07,229 --> 01:40:08,893
Do you know
why you spared my life?

1391
01:40:09,799 --> 01:40:11,198
You are very
fond of me and

1392
01:40:11,385 --> 01:40:12,628
I know it!

1393
01:40:12,854 --> 01:40:15,401
The most torturous fourteen
days of my life is

1394
01:40:15,534 --> 01:40:16,628
the time I spent with you!

1395
01:40:16,690 --> 01:40:19,588
You have no purpose
or ambition in life.

1396
01:40:19,831 --> 01:40:21,292
No man will want
to befriend you!

1397
01:40:23,073 --> 01:40:24,487
I'll definitely kill you now.

1398
01:40:24,846 --> 01:40:25,987
Go away!

1399
01:41:34,424 --> 01:41:35,682
Hey, go away.

1400
01:41:35,924 --> 01:41:37,596
No! I don't want
you to go.

1401
01:41:38,049 --> 01:41:39,799
You might have
suffered these 14 days. - Go!

1402
01:41:40,026 --> 01:41:41,604
But I had a good time.
- Go away!

1403
01:41:41,799 --> 01:41:43,284
I was very happy!
- Get lost!

1404
01:41:45,706 --> 01:41:47,401
I have no one.
- Get lost!

1405
01:41:48,401 --> 01:41:50,026
I won't let you go!

1406
01:41:50,354 --> 01:41:51,885
I will not let you go!

1407
01:41:52,346 --> 01:41:54,213
Go away! - No! I won't
let you go to Mars!

1408
01:41:55,221 --> 01:41:57,838
No! I can't let you go.
- Let go!

1409
01:41:58,080 --> 01:42:00,002
I will not let you go.
- Leave me alone.

1410
01:42:00,096 --> 01:42:01,503
There is no one
to take care of you!

1411
01:42:01,628 --> 01:42:03,534
I won't let you go!
- Leave me.

1412
01:42:03,776 --> 01:42:05,549
No! No! I won't
let you go!

1413
01:42:06,853 --> 01:42:08,056
Let me go, buddy!

1414
01:43:15,495 --> 01:43:16,948
You're wearing
a space suit.

1415
01:43:19,901 --> 01:43:20,995
How did I get here?

1416
01:43:35,198 --> 01:43:36,917
Did you also land on Mars?

1417
01:43:38,182 --> 01:43:39,690
Mars! My foot!

1418
01:43:39,846 --> 01:43:41,057
Here! Take this!

1419
01:43:41,878 --> 01:43:43,401
Take this kick!

1420
01:43:43,674 --> 01:43:47,260
I had plans to end my life.
Both of you ruined it for me.

1421
01:43:47,487 --> 01:43:49,948
I can excuse everything
but your logic of wind speed

1422
01:43:50,128 --> 01:43:51,526
and theory of slope.

1423
01:43:51,674 --> 01:43:53,854
Slope! Don't call yourself
a scientist.

1424
01:43:54,088 --> 01:43:56,456
Scientist! Scientist!
You fool!

1425
01:43:56,776 --> 01:43:59,581
Mars! Scientist!

1426
01:43:59,760 --> 01:44:01,424
Both of you have ruined...

1427
01:44:03,338 --> 01:44:04,338
Just go!

1428
01:44:04,971 --> 01:44:06,573
Such a hopeless life!

1429
01:44:07,838 --> 01:44:09,682
I want to die.

1430
01:44:10,042 --> 01:44:12,057
I don't know
what to do.

1431
01:44:14,073 --> 01:44:15,627
I should have
hanged myself.

1432
01:44:15,831 --> 01:44:17,128
Total flop!

1433
01:44:22,331 --> 01:44:25,393
You aimed to fly into
the outer space!

1434
01:44:25,549 --> 01:44:28,971
But we have rolled about
200 feet downwards!

1435
01:44:30,338 --> 01:44:31,534
Just 200 feet!

1436
01:44:32,057 --> 01:44:33,987
200 feet downwards!

1437
01:46:36,942 --> 01:46:37,942
Hey!

1438
01:46:38,645 --> 01:46:40,551
Will it occur again?

1439
01:46:41,668 --> 01:46:43,996
No! I didn't mean to ask
about our trip downward.

1440
01:46:45,145 --> 01:46:48,348
I am asking about alignment
of Earth with Mars.

1441
01:46:48,965 --> 01:46:50,184
You said something!

1442
01:46:50,309 --> 01:46:52,824
After how many years
will this occur again?

1443
01:46:53,856 --> 01:46:55,098
30 years!

1444
01:46:58,916 --> 01:47:00,518
30 more years?

1445
01:47:03,791 --> 01:47:05,495
30 years!

1446
01:47:06,518 --> 01:47:09,588
I don't care if it is 30 years or
300 years or 3000 years.

1447
01:47:10,088 --> 01:47:11,245
I'll definitely go to Mars!

1448
01:47:16,401 --> 01:47:18,080
30 years! Fine!

1449
01:47:19,323 --> 01:47:21,003
How can you be sure
about 3000 years later?

1450
01:47:23,612 --> 01:47:24,612
Are you out of your mind?

1451
01:47:24,768 --> 01:47:25,768
Hey!

1452
01:47:26,080 --> 01:47:27,088
I can do it.

1453
01:47:41,276 --> 01:47:43,760
Rifath Sharukh, a Tamil boy.
A school boy.

1454
01:47:44,143 --> 01:47:45,463
He's completed only
twelfth grade.

1455
01:47:45,737 --> 01:47:47,549
NASA has launched
his satellite.

1456
01:47:51,330 --> 01:47:53,073
There are lot of scientists
in our country.

1457
01:47:53,323 --> 01:47:55,971
Yet how could this young boy achieve
something that they couldn't?

1458
01:48:00,385 --> 01:48:01,432
How did he do it?

1459
01:48:05,909 --> 01:48:07,493
His victory is the
result of efforts

1460
01:48:07,533 --> 01:48:09,026
he put in all his
previous lives!

1461
01:48:31,760 --> 01:48:33,135
Did you smoke up?

1462
01:48:59,244 --> 01:49:00,244
Hey!

1463
01:49:00,588 --> 01:49:02,463
Don't leave me.
Wait! I'll come along.

1464
01:49:03,659 --> 01:49:04,659
Hey!

1465
01:49:05,057 --> 01:49:07,127
You aspired to go to Mars.
But you didn't make it.

1466
01:49:07,713 --> 01:49:09,112
What are you plans now?

1467
01:49:10,096 --> 01:49:11,096
Answer me!

1468
01:49:30,612 --> 01:49:32,518
Velu!
- Sir! - We got them.

1469
01:49:33,330 --> 01:49:34,635
Don't act in haste, sir.

1470
01:49:35,409 --> 01:49:37,768
They made you go around.
Let them come.

1471
01:49:38,088 --> 01:49:39,291
We'll corner them here.

1472
01:50:08,187 --> 01:50:09,930
We could have
caught them alive, sir.

1473
01:50:11,437 --> 01:50:12,984
Why did you shoot them?

1474
01:50:16,788 --> 01:50:17,944
Did I shoot?

1475
01:53:21,630 --> 01:53:24,833
'In the next birth'

1476
01:53:25,638 --> 01:53:28,372
'One fine day in Mars'

1477
01:53:41,231 --> 01:53:45,520
'[CODED MESSAGE]'

1478
01:53:45,810 --> 01:53:50,926
'[CODED MESSAGE]'
