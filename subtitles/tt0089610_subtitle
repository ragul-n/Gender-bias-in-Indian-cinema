1
00:01:16,527 --> 00:01:20,236
Lord Ganesha, I am Rupa,
Chaudhary's daughter.

2
00:01:20,927 --> 00:01:22,599
You would surely know me.

3
00:01:23,207 --> 00:01:27,678
Lord Ganesha, you know
our neighbour Meenakshi?

4
00:01:27,967 --> 00:01:30,765
Many boys came to see her
with a marriage proposal.

5
00:01:31,087 --> 00:01:32,839
Yet her alliance is not fixed.

6
00:01:32,927 --> 00:01:35,202
The villagers speak ill of her.

7
00:01:37,127 --> 00:01:42,201
You would know that a boy is
coming to see me tomorrow.

8
00:01:42,287 --> 00:01:45,006
Can you do something?

9
00:01:45,527 --> 00:01:50,203
Do something so that he
likes me at the first instance.

10
00:01:50,647 --> 00:01:52,842
Let my alliance be fixed. Okay?

11
00:01:55,007 --> 00:01:56,804
'Go round and round. '

12
00:01:56,887 --> 00:01:58,559
'Express your feelings. '

13
00:01:58,647 --> 00:02:01,639
'If the circle is complete, my wish
will be fulfilled or else it won't. '

14
00:02:04,047 --> 00:02:06,356
Lord Ganesha, you are great.

15
00:02:06,447 --> 00:02:07,926
You are God.

16
00:02:55,007 --> 00:02:56,918
Where are you going? Come here.

17
00:02:57,007 --> 00:02:58,599
Come here.

18
00:02:58,687 --> 00:03:00,723
Compete with some courage.

19
00:03:00,807 --> 00:03:04,277
Since long I am watching you
getting hit without hitting him back.

20
00:03:04,367 --> 00:03:05,482
Come here.

21
00:03:05,567 --> 00:03:06,841
Stand firmly.

22
00:03:06,927 --> 00:03:11,762
I am a grocer. I believe in
taking and not giving back.

23
00:03:11,847 --> 00:03:14,315
If someone abuses me,
I keep that safely too.

24
00:03:15,447 --> 00:03:16,596
Turn around.

25
00:03:19,087 --> 00:03:21,442
Keep this in your safe.
- Okay.

26
00:03:21,527 --> 00:03:23,836
Fool.
- Listen teacher.

27
00:03:24,527 --> 00:03:25,596
What is it?

28
00:03:25,687 --> 00:03:27,723
These guys are not paying their fees.

29
00:03:28,087 --> 00:03:29,156
Why?

30
00:03:29,367 --> 00:03:33,565
Your board states that you
teach Judo, Karate, Kung-fu. .

31
00:03:33,647 --> 00:03:35,638
. . but you teach only wrestling.

32
00:03:35,727 --> 00:03:37,922
Fool. Come down.

33
00:03:38,687 --> 00:03:39,756
Come.

34
00:03:40,567 --> 00:03:44,355
These guys think
that I am fooling them.

35
00:03:44,727 --> 00:03:48,720
Listen. If someone
shouts Judo and hits. .

36
00:03:48,807 --> 00:03:51,719
. .or shouts Kung-fu and hits. .

37
00:03:52,007 --> 00:03:56,046
. .or utters any foul
language and hit. .

38
00:03:56,127 --> 00:03:57,480
. .the effect will be the same.

39
00:03:57,567 --> 00:04:00,877
One who is whacked falls down. Right?

40
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:02,281
Go and teach them.
- Okay.

41
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:05,325
Go. - But sir, Karate
and Chinese martial art?

42
00:04:06,487 --> 00:04:11,038
Karate fighters yell
'yahoo' before fighting.

43
00:04:13,887 --> 00:04:14,956
'Yahoo! '

44
00:04:15,847 --> 00:04:18,600
Before fighting
Chinese fighters yell. .

45
00:04:19,967 --> 00:04:21,525
I don't know what they say.

46
00:04:22,687 --> 00:04:23,881
Prey!

47
00:04:35,247 --> 00:04:36,316
Go away!

48
00:05:27,847 --> 00:05:30,202
Village head had called for you.

49
00:05:30,887 --> 00:05:31,956
Why?

50
00:05:32,367 --> 00:05:34,483
There is a land dispute.

51
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:36,478
He wants you to settle the issue.

52
00:05:39,127 --> 00:05:40,480
He should do something too.

53
00:05:41,367 --> 00:05:43,039
He calls me for everything.

54
00:05:46,007 --> 00:05:48,043
Where did you take the cow?

55
00:05:49,127 --> 00:05:50,196
To aunt's place.

56
00:05:51,287 --> 00:05:52,436
Which aunt?

57
00:05:53,167 --> 00:05:54,316
Sita?

58
00:05:54,767 --> 00:05:56,120
My sister?
- Yes, sir.

59
00:05:58,607 --> 00:05:59,722
Why did you send the cow there?

60
00:06:00,167 --> 00:06:04,160
I had sent the cow to
the hospital for shots.

61
00:06:04,847 --> 00:06:07,407
But there was no result.
She doesn't give milk.

62
00:06:08,207 --> 00:06:10,596
A new bull has come at
your sister's place.

63
00:06:11,487 --> 00:06:12,636
Many cows have conceived.

64
00:06:12,927 --> 00:06:15,760
A bull has come or brother-in-law
has started this work too.

65
00:06:16,567 --> 00:06:18,285
If he could have his way, he would. .
- Keep quiet!

66
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:19,925
Don't utter nonsense.

67
00:06:20,767 --> 00:06:23,361
I want to know why you
went to that cheat's house.

68
00:06:26,127 --> 00:06:28,925
Don't you remember that he
took the golden bangles. .

69
00:06:29,247 --> 00:06:30,646
. .to give it to Sita as dowry,
to the goldsmith. .

70
00:06:31,487 --> 00:06:34,957
. .to find whether it was real
gold or not? - That's enough.

71
00:06:35,367 --> 00:06:38,279
Will you be his
enemy forever for that?

72
00:06:38,807 --> 00:06:41,082
Why don't you stop getting
angry for trivial matters?

73
00:06:42,127 --> 00:06:43,958
I don't want any
relationship with corrupt people.

74
00:06:45,727 --> 00:06:50,198
Take the cow and give it to
them who helped her conceive.

75
00:06:50,287 --> 00:06:52,323
Go!
- What are you doing?

76
00:06:52,847 --> 00:06:54,883
Will you give them a cow
for such a small issue?

77
00:06:57,887 --> 00:07:00,606
Why are staring at me? I
told you to take it away.

78
00:08:05,927 --> 00:08:08,282
Shameless! Immoral !

79
00:08:08,647 --> 00:08:10,126
Aren't ashamed?

80
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:14,400
Don't you have respect for women?
Teasing a decent girl?

81
00:08:14,687 --> 00:08:17,645
You're trying to
seduce me for a penny.

82
00:08:17,967 --> 00:08:20,686
May you rot in hell ! May you. .

83
00:08:29,687 --> 00:08:32,406
Come. Let's have fun.

84
00:08:33,007 --> 00:08:34,725
It's tickling.

85
00:08:58,887 --> 00:09:03,278
Wow! You look beautiful
in this red Indian dress.

86
00:09:03,847 --> 00:09:05,405
If I were a boy then. .

87
00:09:05,487 --> 00:09:07,205
Meenakshi ! Come here.

88
00:09:07,527 --> 00:09:10,644
Grandma, till the boy
doesn't see her, I won't move.

89
00:09:10,727 --> 00:09:11,842
I say come here.

90
00:09:12,127 --> 00:09:14,038
I am also saying something.
I won't move.

91
00:09:14,367 --> 00:09:15,595
I will force you to leave.

92
00:09:15,687 --> 00:09:17,598
Grandma, let her stay.
Don't drive her out.

93
00:09:17,847 --> 00:09:18,916
You don't know.

94
00:09:19,167 --> 00:09:23,285
I don't want this jinxed girl in the
house until this alliance is fixed.

95
00:09:35,607 --> 00:09:39,122
Lord Ganesha ! Don't make
my condition like Meenakshi.

96
00:09:39,887 --> 00:09:44,244
Please make him like
me at first sight!

97
00:09:55,567 --> 00:09:56,636
Greetings!

98
00:09:57,407 --> 00:09:58,556
Greetings!
- Come.

99
00:09:58,647 --> 00:10:00,000
Greetings!
- Come.

100
00:10:15,087 --> 00:10:16,202
They have come.

101
00:10:18,767 --> 00:10:19,836
Come, son.

102
00:10:20,047 --> 00:10:21,844
He is sitting. Look.

103
00:10:21,927 --> 00:10:25,317
He is wearing full pant. He
is surely educated. - Yes!

104
00:10:25,727 --> 00:10:28,605
Sir, for five years he
has studied in tenth grade.

105
00:10:28,687 --> 00:10:30,996
Wow! You need guts.

106
00:10:31,087 --> 00:10:34,045
People change their
grades in one year.

107
00:10:34,127 --> 00:10:37,244
He wanted to study
for another five years.

108
00:10:37,607 --> 00:10:39,598
In tenth grade.
- Yes.

109
00:10:40,007 --> 00:10:42,601
Leave education.
- That's what I did.

110
00:10:43,007 --> 00:10:45,726
If he gets used to be in tenth grade,
it will be painful in old age.

111
00:10:46,047 --> 00:10:48,242
By God's grace, we have land,
property, everything.

112
00:10:48,327 --> 00:10:49,806
There is no need for further studies.

113
00:10:50,007 --> 00:10:54,364
They are saying you studied
for five years in tenth grade.

114
00:10:54,887 --> 00:10:58,118
But in reality, you failed.

115
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:01,646
You passed.

116
00:11:02,087 --> 00:11:04,396
Girls, why have you gathered here?

117
00:11:04,487 --> 00:11:07,285
A boy has come with a
proposal for Rupa. - Which boy?

118
00:11:07,367 --> 00:11:09,358
He has come from Rajpura.
The boy is good looking.

119
00:11:09,447 --> 00:11:10,846
Let me see.

120
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:17,843
Nice. Good looking.

121
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:19,838
You have anointed yourself.

122
00:11:20,047 --> 00:11:24,677
Aunt. - He looks wise.
He is perfect for Rupa.

123
00:11:24,927 --> 00:11:26,963
Who is he? A companion.

124
00:11:28,767 --> 00:11:30,325
Didn't you find anyone else?

125
00:11:31,007 --> 00:11:32,804
From where did you get him?

126
00:11:34,207 --> 00:11:35,799
He looks like an ape.

127
00:11:37,047 --> 00:11:39,322
Look, he is staring like a thief.

128
00:11:40,527 --> 00:11:42,836
What was the need to bring him along?

129
00:11:43,247 --> 00:11:46,523
It was a mistake, aunt. I
won't bring him next time.

130
00:11:46,727 --> 00:11:47,842
All right.

131
00:11:52,687 --> 00:11:55,326
Go out and sit on the tractor.

132
00:11:56,127 --> 00:11:59,403
Not on the tractor. Go
and stand on the street.

133
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:03,039
But brother, let me
see the girl first.

134
00:12:04,367 --> 00:12:06,517
I don't want that. Go out.

135
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:07,882
But, brother. .

136
00:12:08,247 --> 00:12:10,841
Not on the street. Go to Rajpura.

137
00:12:10,927 --> 00:12:13,043
I don't have money for the bus.

138
00:12:13,687 --> 00:12:15,723
Then go walking.
- It's very far.

139
00:12:16,207 --> 00:12:18,038
Then run.
- Brother.

140
00:12:18,367 --> 00:12:19,482
Leave quickly.

141
00:12:21,007 --> 00:12:22,998
Greetings!
- Greetings!

142
00:12:23,327 --> 00:12:25,283
You are the groom.
- Yes.

143
00:12:26,567 --> 00:12:29,127
That's why I have sent Montu out.

144
00:12:29,967 --> 00:12:31,844
Mother said you have
come to see a girl.

145
00:12:32,087 --> 00:12:33,645
Yes.
- So I dressed up in a new dress.

146
00:12:33,887 --> 00:12:36,355
Is it good?
- Very good.

147
00:12:36,447 --> 00:12:39,041
But yellow would have been better.

148
00:12:49,767 --> 00:12:51,644
Do you like the
vermillion on my forehead?

149
00:12:52,287 --> 00:12:57,407
It is nice, but a longer
one would look better.

150
00:13:02,927 --> 00:13:05,236
What other things are
required to look better?

151
00:13:11,567 --> 00:13:13,125
You must wear underwear.

152
00:13:19,727 --> 00:13:22,764
Ask Rupa to get tea
and snacks for the guest.

153
00:13:55,927 --> 00:13:57,042
Why are you staring at?

154
00:13:58,567 --> 00:13:59,682
Clean this mess.

155
00:14:05,087 --> 00:14:08,523
You made a mess.
Couldn't you walk properly?

156
00:14:08,607 --> 00:14:10,962
What could I do? I
stumbled because of this dress.

157
00:14:11,287 --> 00:14:14,199
No problem. It happens sometimes.

158
00:14:15,447 --> 00:14:18,519
Now take this tea.
- I won't go.

159
00:14:18,807 --> 00:14:20,604
If you keep crying,
the groom will go back.

160
00:14:20,967 --> 00:14:22,923
Take Lord's name and go ahead.
- No!

161
00:14:23,167 --> 00:14:25,476
While serving tea, say something. .

162
00:14:25,567 --> 00:14:27,285
. .or they will think, you are dumb.
- Yes.

163
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:29,358
What should I say?
- Anything.

164
00:14:29,767 --> 00:14:32,964
Say, drink tea or it will get cold. '
- Yes.

165
00:14:33,047 --> 00:14:35,356
Mother, come with me.

166
00:14:35,447 --> 00:14:38,439
If this is the condition now, how
will you manage after the wedding?

167
00:14:38,527 --> 00:14:40,324
Will you take your granny along?
- Mother.

168
00:14:40,567 --> 00:14:41,841
Come on.
- No.

169
00:14:41,927 --> 00:14:43,121
Good girl !

170
00:14:50,847 --> 00:14:53,407
Oh God ! -Te. . Te. .

171
00:14:54,567 --> 00:14:57,798
Te. . Uh !

172
00:14:57,887 --> 00:14:59,161
Not uncle, dear.

173
00:14:59,247 --> 00:15:01,477
He is your father-in-law.
Call him father.

174
00:15:01,727 --> 00:15:03,683
T. . T. .

175
00:15:03,767 --> 00:15:05,200
Does she stammer?

176
00:15:05,367 --> 00:15:07,198
No. I don't stammer.

177
00:15:07,287 --> 00:15:10,518
I mean to say, tea will
get cold. Drink it quickly.

178
00:15:10,607 --> 00:15:12,723
Tea will get cold. Drink it quickly.

179
00:15:12,807 --> 00:15:14,479
Tea will get cold. Drink it quickly.

180
00:15:14,567 --> 00:15:16,285
Tea will get cold. Drink it quickly.

181
00:15:16,367 --> 00:15:17,482
Tea will get cold.

182
00:15:18,127 --> 00:15:19,196
Tea will get cold.

183
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:21,604
Give it to me.

184
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:24,116
What are you doing, son?

185
00:15:24,567 --> 00:15:27,400
Dad, we've come to see her.

186
00:15:27,967 --> 00:15:29,116
I've seen her.

187
00:15:30,967 --> 00:15:32,082
Very clearly.

188
00:15:33,287 --> 00:15:34,481
She's scared.

189
00:15:34,887 --> 00:15:37,606
She already fell once.
She'll fall again.

190
00:15:38,727 --> 00:15:40,319
Go! I'll serve tea.

191
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:52,876
Thank you very much.

192
00:15:52,967 --> 00:15:54,923
We'll tell barber Ganpat
to give you the message.

193
00:15:55,007 --> 00:15:56,486
We'll inform you.
- Okay.

194
00:15:56,567 --> 00:15:57,716
Come on.

195
00:16:01,887 --> 00:16:05,641
You remind me of my husband.

196
00:16:05,727 --> 00:16:08,400
What? I'm very young.

197
00:16:08,607 --> 00:16:10,279
At that time I was very young too.

198
00:16:11,247 --> 00:16:14,045
He too acted like you.

199
00:16:14,367 --> 00:16:18,155
After reaching home will you
write to us that you like the girl?

200
00:16:19,207 --> 00:16:20,640
I'll tell you now.

201
00:16:20,927 --> 00:16:22,804
I like your girl very much.

202
00:16:23,007 --> 00:16:26,363
I've decided to marry only her.

203
00:17:07,247 --> 00:17:14,517
''You're the first one to
fall in love with me. ''

204
00:17:14,607 --> 00:17:20,921
''You're the first one to
fall in love with me. ''

205
00:17:21,327 --> 00:17:24,876
''We like each other. ''

206
00:17:24,967 --> 00:17:29,279
''You've made my life. ''

207
00:17:30,607 --> 00:17:37,206
''You're the first one to
fall in love with me. ''

208
00:17:37,367 --> 00:17:40,882
''We like each other. ''

209
00:17:40,967 --> 00:17:45,483
''You have made my life. ''

210
00:17:46,647 --> 00:17:54,042
''You're the first one to
fall in love with me. ''

211
00:18:25,847 --> 00:18:29,157
''Your eyes are glowing like light. ''

212
00:18:29,367 --> 00:18:32,916
''They have enlightened my life. ''

213
00:18:33,167 --> 00:18:36,477
''Your promises are true. ''

214
00:18:36,687 --> 00:18:39,918
''I have given my life to you. ''

215
00:18:40,127 --> 00:18:43,437
''Your eyes are glowing like light. ''

216
00:18:43,607 --> 00:18:46,599
''They have enlightened my life. ''

217
00:18:46,687 --> 00:18:50,362
''Your promises are true. ''

218
00:18:50,527 --> 00:18:53,724
''I have given my life to you. ''

219
00:18:53,927 --> 00:19:01,800
''With your consent,
you've fulfilled my dream. ''

220
00:19:02,847 --> 00:19:10,162
''You're the first one to
fall in love with me. ''

221
00:19:40,127 --> 00:19:46,885
''Your face glows like
a glittering silver. ''

222
00:19:47,247 --> 00:19:54,039
''With your support, I've
got everything in this life. ''

223
00:19:54,247 --> 00:20:00,800
''Your face glows like
a glittering silver. ''

224
00:20:01,047 --> 00:20:07,566
''With your support, I've
got everything in this life. ''

225
00:20:07,847 --> 00:20:14,764
''With this new feeling,
you've pleased my heart. ''

226
00:20:16,407 --> 00:20:23,085
''You're the first one to
fall in love with me. ''

227
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:26,637
''We like each other. ''

228
00:20:26,727 --> 00:20:31,084
''You have made my life. ''

229
00:20:32,367 --> 00:20:39,205
''You're the first one to
fall in love with me. ''

230
00:20:59,807 --> 00:21:01,286
I am a boy too.

231
00:21:02,047 --> 00:21:03,958
You know me since I was a kid.

232
00:21:04,327 --> 00:21:06,887
I've played in your
courtyard as a child.

233
00:21:07,247 --> 00:21:10,922
Before asking outsiders, you
should've asked near ones.

234
00:21:11,487 --> 00:21:15,765
I dreamt about Rupa.

235
00:21:16,127 --> 00:21:21,076
I thought of marrying
Rupa with your blessings.

236
00:21:21,327 --> 00:21:25,161
But you've ruined my youth.

237
00:21:25,247 --> 00:21:26,521
And granny. .
- Listen, kid.

238
00:21:26,607 --> 00:21:30,566
Don't call me that.
I feel insignificant.

239
00:21:30,967 --> 00:21:34,960
If not a man, at least call me a boy.

240
00:21:35,047 --> 00:21:36,116
Keep it there.

241
00:21:36,207 --> 00:21:38,767
Aunt.
- You should've told Rupa's father. .

242
00:21:39,007 --> 00:21:41,396
. .about your feelings for her.

243
00:21:41,727 --> 00:21:43,718
Aunt. .
- Give me rolling pin and chair.

244
00:21:43,807 --> 00:21:46,685
You ask me to do household chores.

245
00:21:49,847 --> 00:21:52,919
God, my youth is getting wasted.

246
00:21:53,007 --> 00:21:55,567
On top of that, they want
me to talk to Rupa's dad.

247
00:21:56,407 --> 00:21:57,886
I don't want to get whacked.

248
00:21:58,167 --> 00:22:01,603
I'm too shy. .

249
00:22:01,687 --> 00:22:05,236
. .even to talk to Rupa.

250
00:22:05,327 --> 00:22:08,717
If you're shy, sit at home
like a coward. Don't harass us.

251
00:22:08,807 --> 00:22:11,401
Granny, don't incite me.

252
00:22:11,607 --> 00:22:13,916
Or else I will get violent.

253
00:22:14,207 --> 00:22:19,918
I will go to his
house and fight with him.

254
00:22:21,527 --> 00:22:23,404
''Eat and chant. . ''
- Nandu.

255
00:22:23,487 --> 00:22:24,556
''Lord ! ''

256
00:22:25,527 --> 00:22:27,199
Why are you shouting?

257
00:22:27,767 --> 00:22:30,998
I can hear you even on the road.
- Uncle, I didn't say anything.

258
00:22:31,207 --> 00:22:33,960
I was only complaining to granny.

259
00:22:34,127 --> 00:22:36,641
Yesterday someone came to see Rupa.

260
00:22:36,727 --> 00:22:39,446
But I wasn't informed.
Am I an outsider?

261
00:22:41,767 --> 00:22:43,246
I will keep this cane at its place.

262
00:22:44,007 --> 00:22:47,522
Yes. I said, at such occasion
there are my things to be done.

263
00:22:47,607 --> 00:22:50,405
At such times I
could've been of some help.

264
00:22:52,727 --> 00:22:58,245
I heard the boy is very
decent and looks handsome.

265
00:23:00,287 --> 00:23:03,836
But does Rupa like him?

266
00:23:04,247 --> 00:23:08,035
We like him and he likes Rupa.

267
00:23:08,687 --> 00:23:11,565
He promised to fix the
alliance on reaching home.

268
00:23:12,087 --> 00:23:16,399
He'll surely do that, but is he good?

269
00:23:16,927 --> 00:23:20,715
He has passed tenth grade.
He is the only son.

270
00:23:21,527 --> 00:23:22,596
What else do we want?

271
00:23:23,007 --> 00:23:27,842
That's fine, but is he good?

272
00:23:28,447 --> 00:23:29,926
He's from a well to do family.

273
00:23:30,767 --> 00:23:32,485
They have wealth and property.

274
00:23:33,047 --> 00:23:34,366
Rupa will be happy there.

275
00:23:34,447 --> 00:23:36,165
That's fine, but. .

276
00:23:37,727 --> 00:23:39,319
. . is he good?

277
00:23:39,527 --> 00:23:42,564
What else do you want, fool?
Does he need to have wings?

278
00:23:42,647 --> 00:23:45,764
No! I wanted to get fully satisfied.

279
00:23:46,487 --> 00:23:47,636
Stupid fool !

280
00:23:51,287 --> 00:23:53,357
With the electrification of
the fence, my work is done.

281
00:23:53,687 --> 00:23:56,645
Any animal that comes to
eat my crops at night dies.

282
00:24:00,807 --> 00:24:02,365
Electrician, take this.
- No, ma'am.

283
00:24:02,647 --> 00:24:05,036
I won't take up this risk.
- What risk?

284
00:24:05,847 --> 00:24:07,280
Today this pig died.

285
00:24:07,447 --> 00:24:09,677
What if some human get
electrocuted by this fence?

286
00:24:09,927 --> 00:24:11,485
I will be jailed for ten years.

287
00:24:11,927 --> 00:24:13,997
And what if your
husband touches the fence?

288
00:24:14,287 --> 00:24:16,881
Are you mad? I switch
it on late in the night.

289
00:24:17,047 --> 00:24:18,844
And I switch it off
first thing in the morning.

290
00:24:19,167 --> 00:24:21,362
Keep the money. You
have a family to feed.

291
00:24:21,447 --> 00:24:22,880
What if someone finds out?

292
00:24:22,967 --> 00:24:26,960
Nobody will know. Only I
know about this electric fence.

293
00:24:27,207 --> 00:24:28,686
Connect it quickly and leave.

294
00:24:28,767 --> 00:24:31,235
But you'll be responsible.
- Okay.

295
00:24:31,327 --> 00:24:34,080
Hurry. My son is about to come.
He shouldn't' see it.

296
00:24:36,607 --> 00:24:37,676
What's happening, Montu?

297
00:24:38,367 --> 00:24:40,562
Oiling the cycle, brother.

298
00:24:41,367 --> 00:24:43,323
Why?
- Meaning?

299
00:24:43,887 --> 00:24:47,323
I can ride the cycle
without oiling it. - But where?

300
00:24:52,287 --> 00:24:54,164
To see the girl.

301
00:24:54,687 --> 00:24:57,281
No, to meet her.
- Let's take the tractor.

302
00:24:57,527 --> 00:24:58,880
Its 1 9 miles away.

303
00:24:59,207 --> 00:25:01,641
Mom will question us
if we take the tractor.

304
00:25:01,727 --> 00:25:03,399
Hurry up.
- Okay.

305
00:25:03,487 --> 00:25:06,365
Wait for me. I'll comb my hair.

306
00:25:06,447 --> 00:25:08,199
Don't go.
- Why?

307
00:25:08,727 --> 00:25:12,640
We have to meet the girl, so. .

308
00:25:16,207 --> 00:25:18,357
You want to meet the girl?

309
00:25:18,847 --> 00:25:19,916
Yes!

310
00:25:25,447 --> 00:25:26,562
Show me your hand.

311
00:25:29,207 --> 00:25:31,163
Now rub it on your face.

312
00:25:32,327 --> 00:25:35,160
What are you saying?
- Do it quickly!

313
00:25:41,087 --> 00:25:42,486
Now you look like a fool.

314
00:25:47,487 --> 00:25:48,602
Brother!

315
00:25:48,687 --> 00:25:52,566
''There was a boy on the tractor.
He looked like a hero. ''

316
00:25:52,647 --> 00:25:55,639
Wait.

317
00:25:55,847 --> 00:25:57,838
You won't incur any loss. Wait!

318
00:25:58,607 --> 00:26:00,802
You won't incur any loss. Wait!

319
00:26:01,967 --> 00:26:03,161
What are you doing, uncle?

320
00:26:08,087 --> 00:26:09,202
Nothing.

321
00:26:09,287 --> 00:26:11,721
I was checking the goat.

322
00:26:12,367 --> 00:26:16,042
Don't lie. You were stealing milk?

323
00:26:16,247 --> 00:26:17,805
No. I. .

324
00:26:19,367 --> 00:26:22,120
Rupa. Listen, Rupa.

325
00:26:22,527 --> 00:26:27,237
Don't tell anyone or else
village council will defame me.

326
00:26:27,327 --> 00:26:29,841
And why do you care
about other's goats and milk?

327
00:26:32,247 --> 00:26:34,556
It's our goat and our milk.

328
00:26:36,447 --> 00:26:39,723
It's your goat. Then let's
keep the matter in the family.

329
00:26:39,967 --> 00:26:42,401
If you consider us family, why
didn't you come yesterday? - Yesterday?

330
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:47,204
I went to a nearby village
to teach someone a lesson.

331
00:26:47,767 --> 00:26:49,359
A wrestler challenged me.

332
00:26:49,447 --> 00:26:53,076
I knocked him down with one blow.

333
00:26:54,847 --> 00:26:57,441
Here. I kept it especially for you.

334
00:26:58,407 --> 00:27:01,479
But what was the occasion?
Anything special?

335
00:27:01,567 --> 00:27:02,761
Don't you know?

336
00:27:06,447 --> 00:27:08,642
The groom's family came to see me.

337
00:27:09,047 --> 00:27:12,278
Till yesterday you were a kid, and
today they are fixing your marriage.

338
00:27:12,367 --> 00:27:14,005
Not today. Yesterday.

339
00:27:14,087 --> 00:27:15,918
How's the boy? What's his name?

340
00:27:16,247 --> 00:27:18,522
Granny told me not to take his name.

341
00:27:19,167 --> 00:27:20,600
He lives in Rajpura.

342
00:27:21,167 --> 00:27:24,523
He's 22 years old with
fair complexion. - Okay.

343
00:27:24,807 --> 00:27:27,526
He's tall and wears trousers.
- Okay.

344
00:27:27,607 --> 00:27:29,484
He studied in tenth
grade for five years.

345
00:27:29,927 --> 00:27:32,725
For how many years?
- Five to six years.

346
00:27:32,807 --> 00:27:34,286
He wanted to study more.

347
00:27:34,367 --> 00:27:37,200
But his mother stopped him
fearing he would get habituated to it.

348
00:27:38,367 --> 00:27:41,598
This means he is
solidifying his foundation.

349
00:27:42,207 --> 00:27:43,560
Now I have to meet him.

350
00:27:44,607 --> 00:27:45,722
Listen.
- Yes?

351
00:27:46,647 --> 00:27:48,126
He'll take you along after marriage.

352
00:27:49,447 --> 00:27:50,721
I'll be left back.

353
00:27:51,887 --> 00:27:55,163
Have you thought who will
take care of this old man?

354
00:27:55,847 --> 00:27:57,166
Uncle.

355
00:27:58,207 --> 00:27:59,322
Uncle.

356
00:28:13,807 --> 00:28:16,844
Brother, the girl is a bombshell !

357
00:28:19,087 --> 00:28:23,956
I mean she is very beautiful.

358
00:28:24,407 --> 00:28:25,522
Wait here. I'll meet her.

359
00:28:25,607 --> 00:28:27,802
We've come from far to meet her.

360
00:28:28,247 --> 00:28:31,922
Listen. Give my regards to her.

361
00:28:35,967 --> 00:28:37,082
Rupa.

362
00:28:38,247 --> 00:28:40,078
No!
- Listen to me.

363
00:28:40,327 --> 00:28:41,396
No!

364
00:28:41,607 --> 00:28:43,245
Don't come closer.
- Listen to me.

365
00:28:43,727 --> 00:28:46,366
What happened?
- No!

366
00:28:48,447 --> 00:28:51,519
See who is flirting in our area.

367
00:28:51,847 --> 00:28:52,962
Bring him here.

368
00:28:53,527 --> 00:28:56,439
What happened,
brother? Why is she kicking?

369
00:28:56,527 --> 00:28:57,676
Nothing, pal. That's how she is.

370
00:28:58,047 --> 00:29:00,117
When I saw her first,
she cried like a kid.

371
00:29:00,207 --> 00:29:02,926
I came to meet her from far,
but she didn't talk to me.

372
00:29:03,007 --> 00:29:04,406
Look, she is running away.
- Okay.

373
00:29:04,487 --> 00:29:06,921
But what if she complains at her home?

374
00:29:07,367 --> 00:29:08,482
I don't care.

375
00:29:08,727 --> 00:29:10,524
Where have you come from?

376
00:29:12,767 --> 00:29:14,086
Mind your language.

377
00:29:14,407 --> 00:29:15,965
Don't be rude.

378
00:29:16,367 --> 00:29:17,720
Who are you?
- Teeth-breaker.

379
00:29:19,327 --> 00:29:20,965
What is that?

380
00:29:21,047 --> 00:29:22,321
We break teeth.

381
00:29:23,127 --> 00:29:27,279
Come with us quietly or
else we'll break your teeth.

382
00:29:27,367 --> 00:29:32,236
We're from Rajpura. We
break others' teeth.

383
00:30:17,967 --> 00:30:21,004
Rupa, what happened?
Why are you crying?

384
00:30:21,087 --> 00:30:22,918
The boy who came to see me yesterday. .

385
00:30:23,007 --> 00:30:25,475
. .crossed my path when I went
to fetch water from the river.

386
00:30:25,927 --> 00:30:27,963
I got scared when I saw him.

387
00:30:28,047 --> 00:30:29,560
He threatened me.

388
00:30:30,727 --> 00:30:31,955
I'll strangle you if you scream. '

389
00:30:32,407 --> 00:30:33,522
I'll kill you. '

390
00:30:34,327 --> 00:30:37,637
He's a demon. I won't marry him.

391
00:30:37,967 --> 00:30:41,164
Okay. Stop crying like
kids and come with me.

392
00:31:02,287 --> 00:31:04,118
You've faced amateurs.

393
00:31:04,847 --> 00:31:08,840
I'll send experts now.
Show them your tricks.

394
00:31:48,167 --> 00:31:49,236
Well done.

395
00:31:49,447 --> 00:31:52,245
Don't spare them.
Hit them with sticks.

396
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:53,840
Don't spare them.

397
00:31:54,367 --> 00:31:56,403
Hit everyone.

398
00:31:56,487 --> 00:31:58,284
Yes. Bravo!

399
00:32:21,287 --> 00:32:22,686
Oh no!

400
00:32:39,127 --> 00:32:42,119
Listen. Crawl there.

401
00:32:42,207 --> 00:32:45,961
And hit on his leg or
else he'll knock everyone.

402
00:32:46,327 --> 00:32:48,522
This is against the
rule of combat, sir.

403
00:32:48,607 --> 00:32:51,838
My honour is at stake. Do as I say.

404
00:32:51,927 --> 00:32:53,883
Crawl there!

405
00:32:53,967 --> 00:32:55,605
Crawl there!

406
00:33:07,567 --> 00:33:09,319
Hit him more!

407
00:33:15,567 --> 00:33:17,046
What have I done?

408
00:33:17,127 --> 00:33:19,277
Forgive me. Brother!

409
00:33:26,327 --> 00:33:28,682
Asha, they will kill him!

410
00:33:28,967 --> 00:33:32,960
He'll kill them. See
how he is beating them!

411
00:34:33,647 --> 00:34:34,921
Uncle wrestler!

412
00:34:35,007 --> 00:34:38,158
Stop! He's the boy who
came to see Rupa yesterday.

413
00:34:42,727 --> 00:34:44,683
Welcome, son-in-law!

414
00:34:45,727 --> 00:34:47,365
Welcome!

415
00:34:48,807 --> 00:34:50,399
You should've told us, dear.

416
00:34:50,687 --> 00:34:53,360
Think what would've happened to
you if this girl hadn't shown up?

417
00:34:53,447 --> 00:34:57,156
Thank your stars I didn't enter
the arena or it would've been worse.

418
00:35:00,167 --> 00:35:02,886
You're great in fighting
with sticks. Who taught you?

419
00:35:02,967 --> 00:35:04,116
Master Tajuddin.

420
00:35:04,407 --> 00:35:07,479
Taju? He was my disciple.

421
00:35:07,727 --> 00:35:09,240
Have some shame, shameless!

422
00:35:09,447 --> 00:35:12,519
My disciple's
disciple defeated you all.

423
00:35:14,647 --> 00:35:16,160
Son !

424
00:35:17,087 --> 00:35:18,315
You look fit.

425
00:35:18,807 --> 00:35:20,638
Do you drink goat's milk?
Buffalo's milk.

426
00:35:20,887 --> 00:35:22,002
Really?
- Yes.

427
00:35:22,087 --> 00:35:24,555
It's difficult to milk a buffalo.

428
00:35:24,647 --> 00:35:27,605
Let's go, Montu. - Okay. -
Because with one hand like this and. .

429
00:35:30,047 --> 00:35:31,480
Bye, son.

430
00:35:31,567 --> 00:35:35,845
If someone bullies you
on the path, mention me.

431
00:35:37,127 --> 00:35:38,196
Listen, brother.

432
00:35:38,287 --> 00:35:39,402
What is it now?

433
00:35:39,847 --> 00:35:42,600
Don't feel bad. It
wasn't Rupa's fault.

434
00:35:42,887 --> 00:35:44,923
She got scared on
seeing you all of a sudden.

435
00:35:45,127 --> 00:35:46,196
She is a kid.

436
00:35:46,447 --> 00:35:49,405
Are you her friend?
- Yes.

437
00:36:10,007 --> 00:36:11,520
Your friend is a kid.

438
00:36:12,007 --> 00:36:17,718
Tell her to lie in the cradle.

439
00:36:20,167 --> 00:36:21,282
Come on.

440
00:36:22,327 --> 00:36:25,205
Bye. See you later.

441
00:37:22,407 --> 00:37:26,400
''What kind of a beloved I have got?''

442
00:37:26,767 --> 00:37:30,760
''God save others from similar plight. ''

443
00:37:31,087 --> 00:37:34,966
''What kind of a beloved I have got?''

444
00:37:35,487 --> 00:37:39,082
''God save others from similar plight. ''

445
00:37:39,807 --> 00:37:48,078
''My youth will pass in
teaching her the meaning of love. ''

446
00:37:48,527 --> 00:37:57,162
''My youth will pass in
teaching her the meaning of love. ''

447
00:38:19,127 --> 00:38:27,603
''When I tease her with love,
she screams loudly. ''

448
00:38:28,047 --> 00:38:35,965
''She is dim-wit like a kid.
She looks like a doll. ''

449
00:38:36,447 --> 00:38:44,877
''This ignorant doesn't
understand the language of love. ''

450
00:38:45,247 --> 00:38:53,837
''This ignorant doesn't
understand the language of love. ''

451
00:39:02,807 --> 00:39:05,958
''What kind of a beloved I have got?''

452
00:39:07,087 --> 00:39:10,796
''God save others from similar plight. ''

453
00:39:11,487 --> 00:39:20,361
''My youth will pass in
taking care of her. ''

454
00:39:46,407 --> 00:39:54,724
''I don't know when she will
learn how to unite hearts. ''

455
00:39:54,927 --> 00:40:02,959
''She is an antic piece
in this modern world. ''

456
00:40:03,287 --> 00:40:11,365
''How can one fulfil
the desire of the heart?''

457
00:40:11,847 --> 00:40:20,198
''How can one fulfil
the desire of the heart?''

458
00:40:29,087 --> 00:40:32,124
''What kind of a beloved I have got?''

459
00:40:33,287 --> 00:40:36,882
''God save others from similar plight. ''

460
00:40:37,607 --> 00:40:45,685
''The romantic season will
pass in playing games with her. ''

461
00:40:46,127 --> 00:40:49,961
''What kind of a beloved I have got?''

462
00:40:50,407 --> 00:40:54,446
''God save others from similar plight. ''

463
00:40:54,647 --> 00:41:02,964
''My youth will pass in
teaching her the meaning of love. ''

464
00:41:04,807 --> 00:41:07,685
Seven. Eight. Ten. Eleven. Twelve.

465
00:41:08,887 --> 00:41:10,559
It's inauspicious.

466
00:41:11,447 --> 00:41:13,324
And now let's talk about 25th.

467
00:41:13,967 --> 00:41:15,366
It's inauspicious too.

468
00:41:15,767 --> 00:41:19,760
Priest, do you know
brother wants to marry soon?

469
00:41:20,127 --> 00:41:24,643
When you can't fix engagement
date when will he get married?

470
00:41:25,047 --> 00:41:26,275
Shut up, Montu !

471
00:41:27,727 --> 00:41:28,842
Wait.

472
00:41:29,327 --> 00:41:32,956
Priest, fix an
auspicious day in this month.

473
00:41:33,367 --> 00:41:34,436
Come on.

474
00:41:35,447 --> 00:41:39,725
Priest, can't this
auspicious day come sooner?

475
00:41:42,287 --> 00:41:45,279
With auspicious deeds,
auspicious days can come sooner.

476
00:41:46,207 --> 00:41:48,675
Do some more auspicious deeds.

477
00:41:49,967 --> 00:41:51,241
Bring the coat quickly.

478
00:41:53,087 --> 00:41:58,002
If not 25th how about 24th?

479
00:42:00,527 --> 00:42:01,642
23rd?

480
00:42:02,807 --> 00:42:03,956
22nd?

481
00:42:04,727 --> 00:42:06,319
Is 20th fine.
- It's up to you.

482
00:42:06,807 --> 00:42:09,367
Fix it as soon as possible.

483
00:42:09,447 --> 00:42:10,596
How about 1st?

484
00:42:10,687 --> 00:42:13,326
It already passed.

485
00:42:13,407 --> 00:42:15,284
Today is 5th.

486
00:42:18,527 --> 00:42:21,564
Then fix it on 10th.
Nothing can happen before that.

487
00:42:21,847 --> 00:42:23,166
Montu.
- Yes, uncle?

488
00:42:23,567 --> 00:42:25,603
Meet the bride's family.
- Okay.

489
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:28,598
First listen to him.
- Yes.

490
00:42:28,687 --> 00:42:29,961
Why are you running?

491
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:32,641
Tell them engagement
is fixed on 10th. - Yes.

492
00:42:32,727 --> 00:42:36,242
If they don't mind, fix the date.

493
00:42:36,327 --> 00:42:38,363
I'll be back in a jiffy.

494
00:42:38,447 --> 00:42:39,641
Go now.

495
00:42:43,007 --> 00:42:44,076
Where are you going?

496
00:42:44,327 --> 00:42:47,558
To fix the alliance of that girl. .

497
00:42:47,647 --> 00:42:49,763
I mean sister-in-law.

498
00:43:05,647 --> 00:43:06,762
Brother.

499
00:43:17,047 --> 00:43:19,402
Is anyone home?
- No.

500
00:43:19,727 --> 00:43:21,604
Dad is in the field,
mom in the temple. .

501
00:43:21,687 --> 00:43:23,882

gossiping in the neighbourhood.

502
00:43:23,967 --> 00:43:26,083
What do you want?

00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:30,676
Oh !

Listen. .
- Sit there. I'll get tea.

505
00:43:33,087 --> 00:43:34,156
No need.

506
00:43:34,727 --> 00:43:35,921
Please come.

507
00:43:37,327 --> 00:43:38,760
Listen. Nobody is home.

508
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:43,003
Let's sit together and
talk something sweet.

509
00:43:46,087 --> 00:43:48,043
If you don't come close, I will.

510
00:43:54,527 --> 00:43:55,801
No!

511
00:43:56,167 --> 00:43:58,806
Why are you coming here? Stop.

512
00:43:59,047 --> 00:44:01,845
Asha ! Kamla ! Vimla ! Aunt!

513
00:44:01,927 --> 00:44:03,679

00:44:21,567 --> 00:44:24,001
Tell him to leave as nobody is home.

517

He's your beloved from Rajpura.

518
00:44:26,407 --> 00:44:28,159
Vimla, you tell him.

519
00:44:28,247 --> 00:44:31,876
No. I feel shy to talk
to strangers. You tell.

520
00:44:31,967 --> 00:44:34,481
No. I'm stunned to see him.

521
00:44:34,567 --> 00:44:36,444
Aunt, you tell him.

522
00:44:36,727 --> 00:44:40,959
No. I feel shy to talk to young men.

523
00:44:53,207 --> 00:44:54,640
Son-in-law?

524
00:44:54,727 --> 00:44:56,319

Why have you come here
alone early in the morning?

528
00:45:06,887 --> 00:45:08,002
Anything special?

529
00:45:09,207 --> 00:45:12,085
I came to tell them we've
fixed the engagement date.

530
00:45:13,447 --> 00:45:17,838
To tell us the engagement
date or see your fiancace

531
00:45:17,927 --> 00:45:19,121
I'm not so lucky.

532
00:45:19,727 --> 00:45:21,718
On seeing me, she
runs as if I'm a ghost.

533
00:45:21,807 --> 00:45:23,798
Really?
- Yes. - I'll call her.

534
00:45:24,567 --> 00:45:26,398
Rupa.
- Yes, uncle?

535
00:45:26,487 --> 00:45:28,842
Get a glass of water, child.

536
00:45:28,927 --> 00:45:30,042
Okay.

537
00:45:30,367 --> 00:45:33,643
You need experience to do anything.

538
00:45:34,007 --> 00:45:35,963
You need idea to get your work done.

539
00:45:36,047 --> 00:45:40,325
You get experience with
age and idea from brain.

540
00:45:40,407 --> 00:45:43,080
I have both.

541
00:45:43,367 --> 00:45:46,279
Age and experience and brain.

542
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:48,961
I can do anything like. .

543
00:45:57,807 --> 00:45:58,876
Son, drink water.

544
00:46:02,847 --> 00:46:05,441
Here. Drink water.

545
00:46:06,287 --> 00:46:07,640
Customs.

546
00:46:07,887 --> 00:46:09,002
Respect.

547
00:46:09,287 --> 00:46:11,676
Our women folks are very traditional.

548
00:46:12,047 --> 00:46:16,279
Even old women come in
veil in front of strangers.

549
00:46:16,367 --> 00:46:17,800
Customs. Respect.

550
00:46:23,007 --> 00:46:24,565
I have another idea.

551
00:46:31,047 --> 00:46:33,356
Leave me. Leave me for God's sake.

552
00:46:33,687 --> 00:46:36,076
God won't help.

553
00:46:36,167 --> 00:46:37,395
Now let me see what you do?
- Leave me.

554
00:46:37,487 --> 00:46:39,205
Come.
- Leave me or else I'll scream.

555
00:46:39,287 --> 00:46:40,720
You're already screaming.

556
00:46:40,927 --> 00:46:42,997
Scream more. Louder.

557
00:46:43,487 --> 00:46:45,159
Leave me.

558
00:47:14,007 --> 00:47:15,884
Rupa !

559
00:47:16,367 --> 00:47:18,437
Wake up. I won't say anything.

560
00:47:19,647 --> 00:47:22,036
I'm Shekhar. Your fiancace.

561
00:47:23,167 --> 00:47:24,316
Rupa !

562
00:47:26,647 --> 00:47:29,320
Oh God ! This will
become a police case.

563
00:47:48,607 --> 00:47:50,165
If you scream, I'll strangle you.

564
00:47:50,807 --> 00:47:53,799
I cycle for 1 9 miles to meet you.

565
00:47:54,047 --> 00:47:56,800
But you flee like a scared hare.

566
00:47:56,887 --> 00:47:57,956
You !

567
00:48:01,527 --> 00:48:03,324
Can't you talk lovingly?

568
00:48:03,647 --> 00:48:05,956
Can I talk lovingly
with muffler in my mouth?

569
00:48:06,887 --> 00:48:09,685
I'll take it out. But talk properly.

570
00:48:09,967 --> 00:48:12,003
If you scream. .
- No.

571
00:48:21,927 --> 00:48:22,996
Talk properly.

572
00:48:23,207 --> 00:48:25,243
Couldn't you find any
other place to talk to me?

573
00:48:25,447 --> 00:48:27,324
What's wrong with this place?

574
00:48:27,407 --> 00:48:29,363
Those who do bad deeds come here.

575
00:48:32,007 --> 00:48:35,158
Let's too do something bad.

576
00:48:36,207 --> 00:48:38,402
Leave me.
- I told you not to scream.

577
00:48:38,607 --> 00:48:40,325
Leave me alone.

578
00:48:40,407 --> 00:48:41,556
Leave me!

579
00:48:45,287 --> 00:48:46,356
Go!

580
00:48:48,047 --> 00:48:51,198
But remember, I'll break the
engagement after reaching home.

581
00:48:52,127 --> 00:48:55,722
I'll tell my parents I don't like you.

582
00:48:56,247 --> 00:49:00,081
After that I'll see
someone else in your village.

583
00:49:01,327 --> 00:49:03,966
I know you can do anything. .

584
00:49:04,607 --> 00:49:08,202
. .as you're a male.

585
00:49:08,887 --> 00:49:10,525
You can see as many girls as you want.

586
00:49:11,007 --> 00:49:12,565
That's why you threaten me.

587
00:49:13,687 --> 00:49:16,076
Okay. You can see
other girls with pleasure.

588
00:49:16,567 --> 00:49:20,719
But on your return, you'll
get to see my corpse too.

589
00:49:26,687 --> 00:49:29,645
You're shrewd. You never
uttered a word earlier.

590
00:49:29,727 --> 00:49:31,877
What's shrewdness in that?

591
00:49:31,967 --> 00:49:34,401
I come to meet you from afar.
Can't you even talk to me?

592
00:49:35,927 --> 00:49:38,361
I'll talk to you if
you don't touch me.

593
00:49:38,727 --> 00:49:40,001
Speak loudly.

594
00:49:40,287 --> 00:49:43,120
I'll talk to you if
you don't touch me.

595
00:49:45,167 --> 00:49:48,682
Okay. Can I touch you after marriage?

596
00:49:52,167 --> 00:49:55,079
After marriage I'll touch you.

597
00:49:59,287 --> 00:50:01,755
I'll come here again to meet you.

598
00:50:11,407 --> 00:50:14,160
Uncle, why does this
wrestler observe silence. .

599
00:50:14,407 --> 00:50:15,601
. .on every full moon day?

600
00:50:15,887 --> 00:50:17,605
And where does he go to offer flowers?

601
00:50:17,847 --> 00:50:20,202
I'm observing it for
the past 30 years.

602
00:50:20,287 --> 00:50:21,515
I don't know where he goes.

603
00:50:21,927 --> 00:50:27,479
When I asked him once,
I got a swollen back.

604
00:51:01,527 --> 00:51:02,880
Here. I've come.

605
00:51:04,687 --> 00:51:07,520
What happened? Why are you staring me?

606
00:51:07,767 --> 00:51:10,725
I'm wondering if you're the
same girl whom I met yesterday.

607
00:51:12,047 --> 00:51:13,480
You were dumb till yesterday.

608
00:51:14,007 --> 00:51:15,156
I thought you wouldn't come.

609
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:20,202
I thought if you cycle
for 1 9 miles daily. .

610
00:51:20,407 --> 00:51:22,125
. .I should come to meet you.
- Really?

611
00:51:22,207 --> 00:51:23,799
I've got something for you.

612
00:51:23,887 --> 00:51:25,843
Dice to play Ludo.

613
00:51:26,127 --> 00:51:27,196
Do you like it?

614
00:51:27,287 --> 00:51:29,198
I'll get it tomorrow.
We'll play together.

615
00:51:36,287 --> 00:51:39,085
I've brought roasted
peanuts for you. Have some.

616
00:51:43,007 --> 00:51:44,156
What happened?

617
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:48,521
My ignorant one!

618
00:51:49,327 --> 00:51:51,602
Even Juliet never
did this for her Romeo.

619
00:51:52,167 --> 00:51:54,761
Poor Romeo died
without eating peanuts.

620
00:51:56,607 --> 00:51:57,926
Who was Romeo?

621
00:52:01,647 --> 00:52:03,046
What's the need to be angry?

622
00:52:05,567 --> 00:52:07,762
I think it's risky to marry you.

623
00:52:08,567 --> 00:52:11,127
What if you give me
peanuts on the first night?

624
00:52:13,007 --> 00:52:16,317
Do you know anything
about life after marriage?

625
00:52:17,247 --> 00:52:18,362
I know.

626
00:52:18,967 --> 00:52:20,878
Really? You know everything?

627
00:52:21,207 --> 00:52:23,163
Yes.
- Tell me.

628
00:52:23,767 --> 00:52:27,396
Wife takes tea for husband
first thing in the morning.

629
00:52:27,687 --> 00:52:28,881
Good. Then?

630
00:52:29,527 --> 00:52:32,837
Then gives him hot water to bath.
- Then?

631
00:52:33,207 --> 00:52:35,596
Then prepares breakfast for him.

632
00:52:37,127 --> 00:52:40,802
Then lunch and dinner. After that?

633
00:52:41,407 --> 00:52:42,726
After that. .

634
00:52:43,527 --> 00:52:44,596
Yes.

635
00:52:44,847 --> 00:52:46,917
A cup of tea again next morning. .

636
00:52:48,767 --> 00:52:53,158
There is an entire night
between dinner and breakfast.

637
00:52:53,607 --> 00:52:54,756
You forgot that.

638
00:52:55,407 --> 00:52:58,604
What will happen at night?

639
00:52:59,807 --> 00:53:01,604
At night?
- Yes.

640
00:53:01,887 --> 00:53:03,843
I know.
- What?

641
00:53:05,567 --> 00:53:07,876
Groom will rest on the bed at night.

642
00:53:08,567 --> 00:53:10,603
The bride will bring milk for him.

643
00:53:11,247 --> 00:53:13,283
The groom will take milk.

644
00:53:13,847 --> 00:53:16,077
Bride will lie on the bed.

645
00:53:17,007 --> 00:53:20,044
Do you know what the
groom will do next? - What?

646
00:53:20,607 --> 00:53:23,679
He will hug the bride.

647
00:53:23,767 --> 00:53:24,995
Good. Then?

648
00:53:25,447 --> 00:53:29,440
The bride will walk slowly.

649
00:53:29,767 --> 00:53:32,600
Where?
- To close the door.

650
00:53:34,807 --> 00:53:35,876
Then?

651
00:53:36,247 --> 00:53:38,363
She will return and
switch off the lights.

652
00:53:38,647 --> 00:53:41,400
Great. You're on the right path. Then?

653
00:53:41,887 --> 00:53:43,923
Then darkness.

654
00:53:44,767 --> 00:53:46,723
Don't you know what
happens in the darkness?

655
00:53:50,327 --> 00:53:51,442
Think.

656
00:53:51,527 --> 00:53:52,642
Think and answer me.

657
00:53:54,967 --> 00:53:56,195
Try to think.

658
00:53:56,367 --> 00:54:01,361
Maybe you have seen in some
movie or heard from some friend.

659
00:54:01,887 --> 00:54:03,161
Yes.
- Yes?

660
00:54:03,247 --> 00:54:05,044
I've seen in a movie.

661
00:54:05,527 --> 00:54:08,405
Lights were switched off. It was dark.

662
00:54:08,847 --> 00:54:12,601
Then two flowers united quivering.

663
00:54:13,047 --> 00:54:16,676
Then two birds brought
their bills together and. .

664
00:54:18,127 --> 00:54:21,676
Pal, you're talking about old movies.

665
00:54:22,087 --> 00:54:23,520
Talk about some new movies.

666
00:54:24,007 --> 00:54:25,440
What happens in that?

667
00:54:25,527 --> 00:54:30,601
Boys and girls interlock
their fingers like this and. .

668
00:54:30,687 --> 00:54:32,917
Do you know what that means?
- What?

669
00:54:34,247 --> 00:54:36,715
Listen. This is a boy's hand.

670
00:54:38,087 --> 00:54:39,406
And this is a girl's hand.

Do you know what happens next?
- Yes!

677
00:55:01,127 --> 00:55:05,723
After dinner I'll
massage you and put you to bed.

678
00:55:23,767 --> 00:55:25,644
Wait a second.

679
00:55:30,847 --> 00:55:31,962
Oh God !

680
00:55:35,767 --> 00:55:37,439
What happened?
- Thorn.

681
00:55:37,887 --> 00:55:40,276
I'll help you out.
- Leave me.

682
00:55:41,487 --> 00:55:43,045
Leave me. Don't touch me!

683

I'll slap you if you scream.

684
00:55:45,567 --> 00:55:46,716
Shut up!

685
00:56:28,367 --> 00:56:30,642
Look, when you'll come tomorrow. .

686
00:56:31,087 --> 00:56:34,124
. . no thorn will dare to prick you.

687
00:56:34,727 --> 00:56:36,126
What will you do?

688
00:57:07,167 --> 00:57:12,719
''Love. Love. ''

689
00:57:13,327 --> 00:57:18,685

01:00:20,807 --> 01:00:24,004
''I'll make even the
sky bow before you. ''

706
01:00:24,967 --> 01:00:33,397
''I'll give you all
the joy in this world. ''

707
01:00:33,487 --> 01:00:36,763
''I'll fulfil my promise of love. ''

708
01:00:37,527 --> 01:00:40,963
''I'll make even the
sky bow before you. ''

709
01:00:41,687 --> 01:00:49,844
''I'll give you all
the joy in this world. ''

710
01:00:49,927 --> 01:01:00,519
''Neither relations nor bonds,
but you need love to live. ''

711
01:01:00,767 --> 01:01:08,720
''Neither air nor water,
but you need love to live. ''

712
01:01:08,807 --> 01:01:19,240
''Neither money nor power,
but you need love to live. ''

713
01:01:19,447 --> 01:01:24,760
''Love. Love. ''

714
01:01:25,527 --> 01:01:30,760
''Love. Love. ''

715
01:01:31,647 --> 01:01:37,165
''Love. Love. ''

716
01:01:37,727 --> 01:01:39,524
''Love. ''

717
01:01:41,767 --> 01:01:44,804
We are done eating. Now what's left?

718
01:01:44,887 --> 01:01:47,162
The plates are left. But leave them!

719
01:01:51,927 --> 01:01:53,042
Okay.

720
01:01:53,487 --> 01:01:55,717
Stop kidding. Now
let's get back to business.

721
01:01:55,807 --> 01:01:57,320
Yes. Now let's get back to business.

722
01:01:58,127 --> 01:02:01,278
Sister, what do you want in
dowry from the girl's family?

723
01:02:01,567 --> 01:02:04,525
Nothing. We want the girl
to bring just three dresses.

724
01:02:05,247 --> 01:02:07,966
And the jewellery that they'll
give will be for their daughter.

725
01:02:08,847 --> 01:02:11,884
500 grams of jewellery.
And 50,000 cash.

726
01:02:12,847 --> 01:02:14,599
Right, dear?
- Yes. Absolutely right.

727
01:02:17,407 --> 01:02:18,556
Brother, did you hear?

728
01:02:20,007 --> 01:02:21,998
They want the girl to
bring just three dresses.

729
01:02:24,047 --> 01:02:25,719
And 500 grams of jewellery.

730
01:02:26,527 --> 01:02:28,358
And 50,000 cash.

731
01:02:31,487 --> 01:02:33,557
You are sitting in a market.

732
01:02:34,407 --> 01:02:35,601
Do you accept this deal?

733
01:02:38,527 --> 01:02:40,358
I'll be right back.
- Okay.

734
01:02:41,247 --> 01:02:42,396
Mr. Ganpat.
- Yes?

735
01:02:42,487 --> 01:02:43,602
Come in.

736
01:02:47,447 --> 01:02:49,597
Idiot! What have you done?
- Pardon?

737
01:02:50,047 --> 01:02:51,685
I had told you how much I can give.

738
01:02:52,207 --> 01:02:54,004
Landlord, it doesn't
make much of a difference.

739
01:02:54,207 --> 01:02:57,165
We'll negotiate.
- What negotiation !

740
01:02:58,047 --> 01:02:59,366
Why didn't you tell them the truth?

741
01:03:00,247 --> 01:03:01,726
From where will I bring 50,000?

742
01:03:03,367 --> 01:03:04,686
I was disgraced. .

743
01:03:17,007 --> 01:03:19,521
Leave. I'll be there.
- Okay.

744
01:03:27,527 --> 01:03:28,642
Exactly.

745
01:03:32,447 --> 01:03:34,085
Don't worry, sir.

746
01:03:34,167 --> 01:03:36,522
Landlord thinks that the
dowry demand is bit too much.

747
01:03:36,687 --> 01:03:38,723
I told him we will negotiate.

748
01:03:38,887 --> 01:03:41,845
Landlord turned pale on
hearing the amount of dowry.

749
01:03:41,927 --> 01:03:42,996
Did you see?

750
01:03:43,247 --> 01:03:46,045
We are from Rajpura. We talk clearly.

751
01:03:46,527 --> 01:03:48,802
We won't accept less
than what we asked.

752
01:03:49,447 --> 01:03:53,076
I can't bite off more than I can chew.

753
01:03:55,927 --> 01:03:57,042
You are big people.

754
01:03:57,807 --> 01:03:59,160
What you said is right.

755
01:04:00,727 --> 01:04:02,240
But I can't afford it.

756
01:04:03,647 --> 01:04:05,877
I had told Ganpat that I
can give 200 grams jewellery.

757
01:04:06,167 --> 01:04:07,725
And 20,000 cash.

758
01:04:09,487 --> 01:04:11,364
I don't know why he
didn't tell you that.

759
01:04:12,327 --> 01:04:15,046
You have come to my house.

760
01:04:16,167 --> 01:04:18,283
This is all that I can do for you.

761
01:04:19,487 --> 01:04:23,321
I'll give 300 grams of
jewellery and 30,000 cash.

762
01:04:24,247 --> 01:04:25,646
I can't give more than that.

763
01:04:25,847 --> 01:04:27,246
You are not doing charity.

764
01:04:27,407 --> 01:04:29,238
Whatever you are
giving is for your daughter.

765
01:04:30,967 --> 01:04:32,400
Sister, don't say that.

766
01:04:32,927 --> 01:04:35,600
Landlord has compromised.

767
01:04:36,407 --> 01:04:37,681
You too compromise.

768
01:04:38,407 --> 01:04:39,556
This alliance will be fixed.

769
01:04:39,727 --> 01:04:42,446
We are not used to compromising.

770
01:04:42,527 --> 01:04:44,358
Our son has passed the tenth grade.

771
01:04:44,447 --> 01:04:48,804
We'll get hundreds of proposals.
Just reply in 'yes' or 'no'.

772
01:04:56,807 --> 01:04:58,684
Don't be so stubborn.

773
01:05:00,247 --> 01:05:03,284
I beg of you ! Don't be so stubborn.

774
01:05:04,487 --> 01:05:06,557
You have everything
by the grace of God.

775
01:05:07,607 --> 01:05:09,438
Please agree and fix this alliance.

776
01:05:11,567 --> 01:05:12,636
I have only one daughter.

777
01:05:13,807 --> 01:05:15,206
And he's your only son.

778
01:05:16,727 --> 01:05:17,876
Please think of their happiness.

779
01:05:17,967 --> 01:05:22,040
You don't need to beg for
our happiness. Wipe your tears.

780
01:05:22,127 --> 01:05:24,595
For her find a boy
who is of your status.

781
01:05:26,007 --> 01:05:28,123
Mind your language!

782
01:05:28,727 --> 01:05:30,399
You don't know my uncle.

783
01:05:30,847 --> 01:05:34,203
His dignity is dearer
to him than his life.

784
01:05:34,767 --> 01:05:38,442
He is quiet because he
doesn't want to argue with women.

785
01:05:38,527 --> 01:05:40,438
Otherwise he would
have taught you a lesson.

786
01:05:40,527 --> 01:05:42,802
Tell him to take care of his daughter.

787
01:05:43,007 --> 01:05:45,202
His daughter is ugly and he
wants her to marry my son.

788
01:05:45,607 --> 01:05:49,043
But your son isn't a minister either.

789
01:05:49,247 --> 01:05:55,595
If you don't like
this proposal, get lost.

790
01:05:55,687 --> 01:05:57,484
Do you think we will sit here?

791
01:05:57,847 --> 01:06:01,476
No one cares for people
like you. My son is like gold.

792
01:06:01,647 --> 01:06:05,003
There is no dearth of girls for him.
- Then listen.

793
01:06:05,087 --> 01:06:08,841
Make your son stand in a market.

794
01:06:08,927 --> 01:06:11,395
You will get good
price there. Auction him.

795
01:06:11,487 --> 01:06:13,876
Why would we auction our son?

796
01:06:14,327 --> 01:06:15,760
Explain it to these beggars. .

797
01:06:15,967 --> 01:06:18,845
. .that if they don't find a boy
they'll have to sell their daughter.

798
01:06:18,927 --> 01:06:20,485
How dare you !
- Shut up!

799
01:06:25,607 --> 01:06:26,756
Enough is enough !

800
01:06:28,287 --> 01:06:31,916
I am giving you my daughter, not
selling some grains, for you to buy.

801
01:06:33,847 --> 01:06:36,156
I don't want to send her to
the house of greedy people.

802
01:06:36,247 --> 01:06:38,715
We wouldn't have stepped. .

803
01:06:39,127 --> 01:06:41,357
. . in such a lowly place
if we had known earlier.

804
01:06:41,447 --> 01:06:43,244
Come on, get up!

805
01:06:43,327 --> 01:06:44,760
Yes. Let's go.

806
01:07:18,687 --> 01:07:20,757
I am going to the fields.

807
01:07:21,887 --> 01:07:25,516
Call me if you get any message
from the village council. - Okay.

808
01:07:29,167 --> 01:07:30,282
Greetings!

809
01:07:34,287 --> 01:07:35,356
Come.

810
01:07:44,647 --> 01:07:45,762
Sit.

811
01:07:57,087 --> 01:08:00,682
Son-in-law, when did you come?
From which bus have you come?

812
01:08:00,767 --> 01:08:02,644
Mother, can't you see we are talking?

813
01:08:02,727 --> 01:08:05,685
But son-in-law has come, so. .
- Didn't you hear?

814
01:08:06,407 --> 01:08:07,522
Go in.

815
01:08:11,407 --> 01:08:13,204
So what brings you here?

816
01:08:16,967 --> 01:08:20,960
I have. .
- Look, I have to go out. So hurry up.

817
01:08:23,607 --> 01:08:26,326
I tried to convince my parents a lot.

818
01:08:26,967 --> 01:08:28,241
But they are still adamant.

819
01:08:29,967 --> 01:08:32,083
I had judged their acumen yesterday.

820
01:08:34,207 --> 01:08:35,481
Now why have you come here?

821
01:08:37,047 --> 01:08:38,162
Rupa and I. .

822
01:08:39,727 --> 01:08:40,876
I like Rupa.

823
01:08:43,407 --> 01:08:44,522
I want that. .

824
01:08:46,487 --> 01:08:50,480
If money is the problem,
keep this money.

825
01:08:57,007 --> 01:08:58,122
20,000.

826
01:08:58,287 --> 01:09:02,200
Give this to my parents
and fix this marriage.

827
01:09:07,007 --> 01:09:09,396
Your parents only called me a beggar.

828
01:09:10,567 --> 01:09:12,637
You have come to make me one.
- Please forgive me.

829
01:09:13,087 --> 01:09:15,476
But don't get me wrong. I was. .

830
01:09:16,887 --> 01:09:20,926
Don't tell my uncle
what's right and what's wrong.

831
01:09:21,007 --> 01:09:23,521
Rs. 20,000 is nothing !

832
01:09:23,807 --> 01:09:28,961
I'll sell myself, my house
and my land for my uncle.

833
01:09:29,047 --> 01:09:31,845
I can place 20,000 at my uncle's feet.

834
01:09:33,527 --> 01:09:34,801
Isn't it, uncle?

835
01:09:35,967 --> 01:09:38,037
Who asked you to meddle?

836
01:09:38,967 --> 01:09:40,082
Go away.

837
01:09:44,127 --> 01:09:48,678
Look son, your mother's words
revealed her character yesterday.

838
01:09:50,687 --> 01:09:52,439
I won't send my
daughter to that house. .

839
01:09:53,207 --> 01:09:54,765
. .where she would be
abused all the time.

840
01:09:54,967 --> 01:09:56,719
We won't stay in that
house after marriage.

841
01:09:57,127 --> 01:09:58,401
I have already decided.

842
01:09:59,447 --> 01:10:00,641
She is my step-mother.

843
01:10:01,527 --> 01:10:02,642
You don't know that.

844
01:10:05,007 --> 01:10:06,998
You are very Zealous, son.

845
01:10:08,967 --> 01:10:11,276
But problems aren't solved by Zest.

846
01:10:13,807 --> 01:10:16,924
I beg of you. Please keep this money.

847
01:10:17,327 --> 01:10:21,206
Stop all this. I am getting late.
I have to go to work.

848
01:10:27,447 --> 01:10:29,517
Have tea before leaving.

849
01:10:44,127 --> 01:10:45,685
God, what has happened?

850
01:10:45,767 --> 01:10:47,246
You brought us together.

851
01:10:47,887 --> 01:10:50,401
And now you have separated us. Why?

852
01:10:51,487 --> 01:10:54,240
Rupa.
- Shekhar!

853
01:11:07,647 --> 01:11:09,558
What has happened, Shekhar?

854
01:11:10,207 --> 01:11:11,560
We got everything.

855
01:11:12,327 --> 01:11:14,602
Then a breeZe of air
changed our fortunes.

856
01:11:16,247 --> 01:11:19,637
Thank our fortune that
made us meet each other. .

857
01:11:21,327 --> 01:11:23,966
. .and tied us together
by love and affection.

858
01:11:26,767 --> 01:11:30,555
And our parents'
decision can't severe this tie.

859
01:11:31,767 --> 01:11:35,077
What do I do? I can't
understand anything.

860
01:11:39,687 --> 01:11:42,360
Let's elope and get married.

861
01:11:43,007 --> 01:11:45,237
No! I won't do anything that. .

862
01:11:45,327 --> 01:11:47,921
. .would disgrace my father
in front of the village.

863
01:11:48,007 --> 01:11:50,805
We are not doing any sin.
We are going to get married.

864
01:11:54,567 --> 01:11:56,000
Listen to me, Rupa.

865
01:11:56,247 --> 01:11:58,397
Everything will be
fine after some time.

866
01:11:58,847 --> 01:12:00,758
By then we will get
married and return to them.

867
01:12:01,047 --> 01:12:02,639
And we'll apologiZe to them.

868
01:12:03,807 --> 01:12:05,843
I am sure they will forgive us.

869
01:12:05,927 --> 01:12:08,361
No! I can't leave my father.

870
01:12:10,007 --> 01:12:12,965
You're harping about your father.

871
01:12:13,687 --> 01:12:15,279
Did you come to meet me
with your father's permission?

872
01:12:15,807 --> 01:12:16,876
Why did you make promises?

873
01:12:17,247 --> 01:12:20,842
Why did you promise me we
will be together forever?

874
01:12:38,127 --> 01:12:39,196
Rupa. .

875
01:12:44,047 --> 01:12:45,685
. .you love me?

876
01:12:46,407 --> 01:12:47,556
Yes.

877
01:12:48,047 --> 01:12:50,515
I too can't live without you.

878
01:12:53,567 --> 01:12:54,682
Now listen.

879
01:12:55,447 --> 01:12:57,836
I will wait for you
here at 4 am tomorrow.

880
01:12:59,647 --> 01:13:02,081
I won't force you.

881
01:13:02,887 --> 01:13:06,402
If you come, I'll think
that our love has won.

882
01:13:07,647 --> 01:13:09,365
And if you don't come. .

883
01:13:09,447 --> 01:13:14,805
. .I'll think our love lost midway.

884
01:16:43,567 --> 01:16:46,718
Father, I erred. Please forgive me!

885
01:16:47,127 --> 01:16:50,085
I know I made a mistake.

886
01:16:50,447 --> 01:16:53,996
Please forgive me! I will
never repeat this mistake.

887
01:16:54,207 --> 01:16:56,402
For God's sake, forgive me.

888
01:17:00,207 --> 01:17:02,437
Dear, let's go in.

889
01:17:02,687 --> 01:17:03,802
Please forgive me!

890
01:17:10,727 --> 01:17:12,046
Listen !

891
01:17:12,127 --> 01:17:14,402
Son.

Open the door!
- Listen ! What are you doing?

893
01:17:17,727 --> 01:17:19,797
For God's sake, don't do this. No!
- Open the door.

894
01:17:19,887 --> 01:17:20,956
What are you doing?
- Open the door.

895
01:17:21,047 --> 01:17:24,437
Father, don' do that.

896
01:17:24,527 --> 01:17:28,805
For God's sake, don't do this.
- Open the door. No!

897
01:17:46,047 --> 01:17:50,006
Stop it!

898
01:18:00,967 --> 01:18:04,403
Father, I won't do it ever again.

899
01:18:14,902 --> 01:18:16,017
Come with me.

900
01:18:22,022 --> 01:18:25,537
Mr. Deendayal, the fence couldn't. .

901
01:18:25,702 --> 01:18:27,499
. . have got connected with
electric wire by itself.

902
01:18:28,062 --> 01:18:30,815
Inspector, don't ask me.
I don't know anything.

903
01:18:31,222 --> 01:18:32,860
My son is unconscious inside.

904
01:18:33,342 --> 01:18:34,775
I am worried about his life.

905
01:18:34,862 --> 01:18:37,376
Who looks after the garden?

906
01:18:37,742 --> 01:18:39,221
Does any gardener work there?

907
01:18:41,902 --> 01:18:46,817
She is the gardener and
the owner of that garden.

908
01:18:47,742 --> 01:18:53,897
Ask her. She is the
boss of this house.

909
01:19:08,382 --> 01:19:09,497
Montu, what happened?

910
01:19:09,942 --> 01:19:12,217
Uncle wrestler, brother
is unconscious inside.

911
01:19:12,302 --> 01:19:13,451
What are the police doing here?

912
01:19:13,662 --> 01:19:17,132
Come along. - Last night while
leaving the house, near the garden. .

913
01:19:26,342 --> 01:19:27,457
Landlord !

914
01:19:36,182 --> 01:19:39,094
The village chief has
summoned you in the village council.

915
01:19:39,942 --> 01:19:42,775
Girdhari's wall has fallen
into his neighbour's courtyard.

916
01:19:43,142 --> 01:19:44,211
He has complained about it.

917
01:19:44,622 --> 01:19:45,816
You have to give the verdict.

918
01:19:49,262 --> 01:19:52,015
I am busy with my fate's verdict.

919
01:19:53,382 --> 01:19:54,531
Tell the village chief that. .

920
01:19:55,502 --> 01:19:57,777
. .I can't decide for my own family.

921
01:19:59,942 --> 01:20:01,739
How will I face the village council?

922
01:20:04,342 --> 01:20:05,457
I. .

923
01:20:06,942 --> 01:20:09,502
I have been disgraced.

924
01:20:18,902 --> 01:20:20,017
Go.

925
01:20:24,222 --> 01:20:26,338
Son, why are you getting disheartened?

926
01:20:28,582 --> 01:20:31,016
You used to encourage others.

927
01:20:31,942 --> 01:20:36,220
And you are hiding here
for such a small thing.

928
01:20:37,542 --> 01:20:39,260
Shakuntala.
- Yes?

929
01:20:40,502 --> 01:20:42,015
Ask your daughter. .

930
01:20:43,502 --> 01:20:45,220
. .did she just cross the
threshold of your house. .

931
01:20:46,422 --> 01:20:49,016
. .or did she cross all her limits.

932
01:20:49,102 --> 01:20:50,581
Why are you saying such things?

933
01:20:52,022 --> 01:20:54,138
My daughter can never do that.

934
01:20:54,582 --> 01:20:56,732
She is very innocent. She gets. .
- Yes.

935
01:20:56,822 --> 01:20:58,778
The girl who elopes
is always innocent.

936
01:21:00,782 --> 01:21:02,738
She has proved her innocence nicely.

937
01:21:06,102 --> 01:21:07,694
People who are not in
control of their emotions. .

938
01:21:09,462 --> 01:21:11,293
. .can't see anything else.

939
01:21:13,382 --> 01:21:14,576
Go and ask her.

940
01:21:15,302 --> 01:21:18,214
If she has done anything
untoward we'll commit suicide.

941
01:21:18,302 --> 01:21:20,896
Don't utter such inauspicious things.

942
01:21:21,382 --> 01:21:24,055
I am sure she will
never cross her limits.

943
01:21:35,422 --> 01:21:38,175
Rupa, what are you doing?

944
01:21:39,582 --> 01:21:40,810
Aunt, come quickly!

945
01:21:41,582 --> 01:21:44,301
Rupa, what have you done?
- Mother!

946
01:21:44,782 --> 01:21:46,374
Don't be mad !

947
01:21:46,982 --> 01:21:51,897
I haven't done anything wrong.
I made a mistake.

948
01:21:52,222 --> 01:21:56,135
Tell father to
forgive me! To forgive me!

949
01:21:56,222 --> 01:21:58,258
Mother! To forgive me!

950
01:21:59,102 --> 01:22:00,171
Mother!

951
01:22:04,022 --> 01:22:05,091
Where are you going?

952
01:22:06,902 --> 01:22:09,257
To meet Rupa.
- Now there's no need to go there.

953
01:22:09,342 --> 01:22:11,458
I have fixed your
marriage somewhere else.

954
01:22:13,382 --> 01:22:15,179
They will take Rs. 100,000. cash.

955
01:22:15,382 --> 01:22:17,942
And I have already
taken 50,000 as token.

956
01:22:18,022 --> 01:22:21,014
I won't marry the girl
to whom you have sold me.

957
01:22:21,102 --> 01:22:23,252
Then will you disgrace
me in front of them?

958
01:22:23,662 --> 01:22:26,859
Say whatever you want to.
I'll marry only Rupa.

959
01:22:26,942 --> 01:22:29,740
Sure. Those beggars
are better than me.

960
01:22:29,822 --> 01:22:33,053
Why would you listen to me?
I am your step-mother?

961
01:22:34,742 --> 01:22:36,460
I have never
considered you my step-mother.

962
01:22:36,982 --> 01:22:38,495
I have loved you
more than my real mom.

963
01:22:39,262 --> 01:22:41,617
Why do you want to sell
my happiness for money?

964
01:22:41,782 --> 01:22:45,695
I have raised you. I spent
money on your education.

965
01:22:45,902 --> 01:22:47,779
Won't I recover the
money that I have spent?

966
01:22:48,462 --> 01:22:51,420
Last time I had run away stealthily.
That was my mistake.

967
01:22:52,702 --> 01:22:54,374
But today I'll go in
front of everyone.

968
01:22:54,462 --> 01:22:56,134
Let me see who stops me.
- Okay go.

969
01:22:56,222 --> 01:22:57,575
Where are you going, son?

970
01:22:57,662 --> 01:23:00,301
Stop it. He's young. .
- You shut up!

971
01:23:00,822 --> 01:23:04,337
Get one thing clearly. If you step
out of this house we'll disown you.

972
01:23:04,422 --> 01:23:05,537
You too hear me out.

973
01:23:05,622 --> 01:23:07,499
I'll never step in this house again.

974
01:23:08,142 --> 01:23:09,211
Son !

975
01:23:35,382 --> 01:23:37,737
Mother, ask him if he
would like to have anything.

976
01:23:41,382 --> 01:23:42,497
Yes.

977
01:23:47,262 --> 01:23:49,457
Son, eat something.

978
01:23:49,902 --> 01:23:51,301
You haven't eaten since yesterday.

979
01:24:00,382 --> 01:24:01,815
Shall I get something for you to eat?

980
01:24:03,982 --> 01:24:05,176
What did the doctor say?

981
01:24:05,902 --> 01:24:07,540
He has given an
ointment to apply on her feet.

982
01:24:07,622 --> 01:24:08,975
She will be fine in
two or three weeks.

983
01:24:09,822 --> 01:24:10,971
Did she eat anything?

984
01:24:14,182 --> 01:24:15,331
Did she eat anything?

985
01:24:16,662 --> 01:24:20,098
She has vowed she
won't have anything. .

986
01:24:20,182 --> 01:24:21,410
. . until you talk to her

987
01:24:22,102 --> 01:24:24,138
You know how stubborn she is.

988
01:24:24,822 --> 01:24:25,937
Not less than her father.

989
01:24:26,702 --> 01:24:27,976
After all, she is your daughter.

990
01:24:29,742 --> 01:24:31,892
Go and check on her once.

991
01:24:32,582 --> 01:24:34,300
It won't hurt your ego.

992
01:24:35,422 --> 01:24:36,821
After all, she is your own child.

993
01:24:39,302 --> 01:24:44,422
I too had pleaded with
you when you were small.

994
01:25:19,262 --> 01:25:20,411
Father. .

995
01:25:23,542 --> 01:25:25,851
Father, please forgive me!

996
01:25:26,262 --> 01:25:27,581
Please forgive me!

997
01:25:27,982 --> 01:25:30,496
I won't live if you
stay angry with me.

998
01:25:30,782 --> 01:25:34,092
I will die! I will die.

999
01:25:36,662 --> 01:25:37,777
I will die.

1000
01:25:40,062 --> 01:25:43,020
Father, just forgive me once.

1001
01:25:43,102 --> 01:25:47,141
I will never do this
mistake ever again. Never!

1002
01:25:47,382 --> 01:25:50,533
Never! Father!

1003
01:25:51,142 --> 01:25:52,291
Father!

1004
01:26:20,902 --> 01:26:26,056
''Love! Love! ''

1005
01:26:26,422 --> 01:26:34,215
''Love! Love! ''

1006
01:27:03,542 --> 01:27:06,215
''Tears roll out of my eyes. ''

1007
01:27:06,302 --> 01:27:08,896
''I am dying to meet you. ''

1008
01:27:09,142 --> 01:27:14,057
''I can't endure this
separation anymore. ''

1009
01:27:17,022 --> 01:27:19,490
''Tears roll out of my eyes''

1010
01:27:19,702 --> 01:27:22,421
''I am dying to meet you. ''

1011
01:27:22,582 --> 01:27:27,451
''I can't endure this
separation anymore. ''

1012
01:27:27,942 --> 01:27:32,936
''I'll forget myself. ''

1013
01:27:33,262 --> 01:27:36,811
''Only then will I forget you. ''

1014
01:27:36,982 --> 01:27:41,214
''Tears roll out of my eyes. ''

1015
01:27:41,302 --> 01:27:44,021
''I am dying to meet you. ''

1016
01:27:44,182 --> 01:27:49,131
''I can't endure this
separation anymore. ''

1017
01:28:29,862 --> 01:28:36,973
''Darling ! I admit I
won't be able to meet you. ''

1018
01:28:37,382 --> 01:28:45,733
''Even then my love for
you won't diminish. ''

1019
01:28:45,822 --> 01:28:52,853
''Darling ! I admit I
won't be able to meet you. ''

1020
01:28:53,142 --> 01:29:01,140
''Even then my love for
you won't diminish. ''

1021
01:29:01,982 --> 01:29:06,897
''I'll forget myself. ''

1022
01:29:07,182 --> 01:29:10,697
''Only then will I forget you. ''

1023
01:29:10,942 --> 01:29:15,060
''Tears roll out of my eyes. ''

1024
01:29:15,222 --> 01:29:17,975
''I am dying to meet you. ''

1025
01:29:18,062 --> 01:29:23,182
''I can't endure this
separation anymore. ''

1026
01:29:41,622 --> 01:29:46,537
''Love! Love! ''

1027
01:29:46,782 --> 01:29:54,018
''Love! Love! ''

1028
01:30:21,342 --> 01:30:23,298
'Father, just forgive me once. '

1029
01:30:23,382 --> 01:30:25,816
'I will never make
this mistake again. '

1030
01:30:40,022 --> 01:30:41,455
What happened to your feet?

1031
01:30:42,062 --> 01:30:44,098
Don't ask me, Shekhar.

1032
01:30:44,702 --> 01:30:46,181
It would be better if you don't ask.

1033
01:30:47,062 --> 01:30:49,496
Please forget me for God's sake.
- Forget you !

1034
01:30:49,742 --> 01:30:50,857
What are you saying, Rupa?

1035
01:30:51,102 --> 01:30:55,095
I. .
- I know you love me a lot.

1036
01:30:55,582 --> 01:30:58,494
And I can't live even for
a moment after losing you.

1037
01:30:58,582 --> 01:31:03,940
But in front of parents'
honour love is nothing.

1038
01:31:04,302 --> 01:31:06,020
Forget me.
- Don't say that.

1039
01:31:07,382 --> 01:31:08,781
Don't say that for God's sake.

1040
01:31:43,902 --> 01:31:45,858
Now you will not
step out of this house.

1041
01:31:46,662 --> 01:31:47,777
Explain it to her.

1042
01:31:48,622 --> 01:31:50,419
I have talked about her
marriage with some people.

1043
01:31:51,422 --> 01:31:54,459
If they even get a
whiff of her misdeeds. .

1044
01:31:54,982 --> 01:31:57,098
. .I will be completely disgraced.

1045
01:31:59,822 --> 01:32:02,131
I don't know why that
unlucky boy came into our lives.

1046
01:32:02,502 --> 01:32:04,140
Is he a father or a monster?

1047
01:32:05,382 --> 01:32:07,577
Rupa had to burn her
feet to pass the acid test.

1048
01:32:08,262 --> 01:32:11,811
Only to convince her
father that our love is pure.

1049
01:32:12,782 --> 01:32:16,218
I'll tell him that he has
no right to harass Rupa.

1050
01:32:16,702 --> 01:32:17,817
Rupa is mine.

1051
01:32:18,182 --> 01:32:20,696
And I will make her mine
in front of this world.

1052
01:32:21,542 --> 01:32:25,421
Son, acting hastily will be of no use.

1053
01:32:25,862 --> 01:32:28,934
I too want you to get married to Rupa.

1054
01:32:29,262 --> 01:32:34,575
But we'll convincer her dad
with wisdom and not haste.

1055
01:32:34,782 --> 01:32:36,738
Come and sit next to me. Come on.

1056
01:32:37,222 --> 01:32:40,931
Forget your anger and come here. Sit.

1057
01:32:42,222 --> 01:32:46,181
If you want to fulfil your desire. .

1058
01:32:46,622 --> 01:32:49,295
. .stay with me in my
house for a few days.

1059
01:32:49,822 --> 01:32:51,460
I will take you to
your destination of love. .

1060
01:32:51,542 --> 01:32:53,976
. . by feeding you goat's milk.

1061
01:32:54,342 --> 01:32:56,139
And if landlord comes in your way. .

1062
01:32:56,542 --> 01:32:58,851
. .I will turn him into a goat.

1063
01:33:02,702 --> 01:33:04,852
Hail Lord !

1064
01:33:11,182 --> 01:33:12,854
Son-in-law, you?

1065
01:33:13,222 --> 01:33:15,656
I heard you were electrocuted.
How are you now?

1066
01:33:16,142 --> 01:33:17,257
I am fine.

1067
01:33:18,422 --> 01:33:20,253
Rupa loves you a lot.

1068
01:33:20,582 --> 01:33:22,015
She adores you, poor thing.

1069
01:33:22,302 --> 01:33:23,860
She keeps on crying all the time.

1070
01:33:24,262 --> 01:33:25,536
But she fears her father.

1071
01:33:25,862 --> 01:33:27,614
Why don't you elope with her?

1072
01:33:29,382 --> 01:33:31,213
Her father is coming out.
- Beware!

1073
01:33:31,862 --> 01:33:36,492
We'll whack you and drive
you out. You don't know my son.

1074
01:33:36,702 --> 01:33:38,454
Who let you in this village?

1075
01:33:38,542 --> 01:33:41,340
It would be better
for you if you go away.

1076
01:33:41,782 --> 01:33:43,738
Or else. .
- What will you do?

1077
01:33:43,822 --> 01:33:45,221
What will we do?

1078
01:33:45,302 --> 01:33:47,372
You don't know us.

1079
01:33:47,462 --> 01:33:50,022
We'll cut you into pieces.

1080
01:33:52,422 --> 01:33:53,901
Do whatever you can.

1081
01:33:53,982 --> 01:33:55,938
If you hadn't been a woman,
I would have. .

1082
01:33:56,022 --> 01:33:58,616
If you hadn't been a man,
I too would have. .

1083
01:33:58,702 --> 01:34:01,421
Mother! Why are you arguing with them?

1084
01:34:01,622 --> 01:34:02,691
Get in.

1085
01:34:03,462 --> 01:34:06,818
You might be a wrestler.
This is not your ring.

1086
01:34:06,902 --> 01:34:08,301
My son is no less.

1087
01:34:23,142 --> 01:34:25,656
Uncle, the landlord is going alone.

1088
01:34:26,182 --> 01:34:28,776
He is the landlord, not a goat that. .

1089
01:34:28,862 --> 01:34:31,171
. .I can get hold of him and milk him.
- Then when will you talk to him?

1090
01:34:32,062 --> 01:34:33,734
You told me you will
appease him when he is alone.

1091
01:34:33,822 --> 01:34:37,258
It's not the right time.

1092
01:34:37,942 --> 01:34:41,139
Have patience. I
will manage everything.

1093
01:34:42,902 --> 01:34:44,858
Greetings, landlord !

1094
01:34:57,782 --> 01:34:59,056
How are you, Rupa?

1095
01:34:59,782 --> 01:35:01,056
How are your feet?

1096
01:35:02,462 --> 01:35:06,171
Rupa, have you given
breakfast to your father?

1097
01:35:06,982 --> 01:35:09,974
Rupa, ask him what does he want.

1098
01:35:10,502 --> 01:35:14,381
Give him and tell him to get lost.
- Rupa, tell your father. .

1099
01:35:14,542 --> 01:35:16,817
. . not to fear as I
haven't come to ask for money.

1100
01:35:18,182 --> 01:35:20,696
I have come here to talk clearly. .

1101
01:35:20,782 --> 01:35:24,218
. . if I can find something to sit.

1102
01:35:24,942 --> 01:35:27,251
You haven't done
anything to deserve a seat.

1103
01:35:27,542 --> 01:35:29,498
Don't preach me about my deeds.

1104
01:35:30,462 --> 01:35:33,818
Today I have come to
show you your deeds.

1105
01:35:33,982 --> 01:35:35,574
I won't keep quiet
even if you abuse me.

1106
01:35:36,262 --> 01:35:39,095
If you don't perform
your duty as a brother. .

1107
01:35:39,182 --> 01:35:44,939
Our ties were severed the
day you sheltered that boy.

1108
01:35:45,222 --> 01:35:48,134
I have come to talk to you about him.

1109
01:35:48,582 --> 01:35:50,015
That boy does not mean anything to me.

1110
01:35:50,262 --> 01:35:53,060
And if he does, it's
because of your daughter.

1111
01:35:53,862 --> 01:35:57,298
She loves him. She wants to marry him.

1112
01:35:58,382 --> 01:35:59,497
Rupa.

1113
01:36:04,702 --> 01:36:06,215
Will you tell him or shall I tell him?

1114
01:36:12,222 --> 01:36:15,134
Uncle, don't interfere in our matters.

1115
01:36:15,662 --> 01:36:18,813
I will marry the guy
whom my father selects.

1116
01:36:30,302 --> 01:36:31,417
Wow!

1117
01:36:31,982 --> 01:36:35,213
You talk so sweetly while crying.

1118
01:36:36,542 --> 01:36:39,454
Go in.

1119
01:36:47,702 --> 01:36:52,696
Landlord, you can't hear
the pain hidden in her voice.

1120
01:36:53,782 --> 01:36:56,376
You have put the rope of your
false dignity around her neck.

1121
01:36:57,262 --> 01:37:00,618
One day she will hang
herself with that same rope.

1122
01:37:02,382 --> 01:37:03,861
You did not hear Rupa?

1123
01:37:04,622 --> 01:37:06,260
I heard her suppressed voice.

1124
01:37:06,662 --> 01:37:08,618
I saw the pain hidden in her voice.

1125
01:37:09,102 --> 01:37:13,061
You can't see it. But I can
even see her dead body hanging.

1126
01:37:13,262 --> 01:37:14,331
Gama !

1127
01:37:14,422 --> 01:37:17,334
Landlord, I won't let
this murder happen again.

1128
01:37:17,982 --> 01:37:19,131
Listen to me carefully.

1129
01:37:19,382 --> 01:37:23,057
If I wanted, I could've made her
vanish within the count of ten.

1130
01:37:23,622 --> 01:37:26,216
But I care about
Rupa's dignity, not yours.

1131
01:37:27,262 --> 01:37:29,776
I am famous in this
village for being blunt.

1132
01:37:30,422 --> 01:37:32,572
Today for the first I am
saying anything after deliberation.

1133
01:37:33,262 --> 01:37:36,299
Listen to me. I beg of you !

1134
01:37:36,662 --> 01:37:38,095
Have mercy on your daughter.

1135
01:37:39,462 --> 01:37:42,181
And if you still won't budge,
listen carefully.

1136
01:37:43,262 --> 01:37:46,811
I'll shave half of my
moustache if I don't get her. .

1137
01:37:46,902 --> 01:37:50,099
. . married to the boy of
her choice within 30 days.

1138
01:37:52,742 --> 01:37:54,460
You too listen to me carefully.

1139
01:37:55,582 --> 01:38:00,133
If Rupa marries that same boy,
it would be after my death.

1140
01:38:06,462 --> 01:38:08,532
Did Rupa say anything?
- Yes.

1141
01:38:09,102 --> 01:38:11,093
She nodded her head
like a goat and said. .

1142
01:38:11,542 --> 01:38:14,056
''Uncle please don't
interfere in our matters. ''

1143
01:38:14,422 --> 01:38:17,732
''I will marry the guy
whom my father selects. ''

1144
01:38:18,102 --> 01:38:21,697
Father! Her father has
put a rope around her neck.

1145
01:38:21,782 --> 01:38:23,261
How will she say anything?

1146
01:38:26,142 --> 01:38:28,292
Don't worry, son.

1147
01:38:29,022 --> 01:38:30,899
I have challenged them. .

1148
01:38:31,262 --> 01:38:33,537
. .that I will shave
half of my moustache. .

1149
01:38:33,622 --> 01:38:36,534
. . if you don't get
married within 30 days.

1150
01:38:36,942 --> 01:38:39,172
Master, I too challenge him.

1151
01:38:39,462 --> 01:38:41,612
You shave it from this side and I
will shave it from the other side.

1152
01:38:41,702 --> 01:38:43,897
Do you have a moustache to shave?

1153
01:38:43,982 --> 01:38:46,177
Don't talk nonsense. Idiot!

1154
01:38:46,262 --> 01:38:47,331
Wrestler

1155
01:38:47,582 --> 01:38:48,810
Yes? - You have been
summoned to the village council.

1156
01:38:49,062 --> 01:38:50,211
Why?

1157
01:38:50,782 --> 01:38:52,613
I don't know. We'll come
to know when we reach there.

1158
01:38:53,102 --> 01:38:55,252
Okay. Go. I'll be there.
- Okay.

1159
01:38:56,222 --> 01:39:00,374
Get ready for a fight!

1160
01:39:01,422 --> 01:39:02,901
What happened? You're alone?

1161
01:39:03,102 --> 01:39:05,411
He said he'll come later.

1162
01:39:06,342 --> 01:39:07,775
No problem. Let him come.

1163
01:39:41,942 --> 01:39:44,297
Gama, the custom of
the village is that. .

1164
01:39:44,382 --> 01:39:46,850
. .whenever a culprit is
summoned to the village assembly. .

1165
01:39:46,942 --> 01:39:48,978
. . he stands humbly with folded hands.

1166
01:39:49,062 --> 01:39:51,496
But you have brought
this throne with you.

1167
01:39:51,822 --> 01:39:52,971
What does this mean?

1168
01:39:53,982 --> 01:39:56,416
This means I am innocent.

1169
01:39:56,862 --> 01:39:58,181
I have not committed any crime.

1170
01:39:58,262 --> 01:40:02,175
The village council will decide
whether you are a culprit or not?

1171
01:40:03,702 --> 01:40:05,738
First stand up and then answer.

1172
01:40:05,822 --> 01:40:07,175
First tell me my crime.

1173
01:40:07,542 --> 01:40:11,899
And boys don't
interrupt elders. Got it?

1174
01:40:11,982 --> 01:40:14,177
Gama, mind your tongue!
- Shut up, Ramsingh !

1175
01:40:14,262 --> 01:40:17,618
Your crime is that you have
given shelter to the boy. .

1176
01:40:17,702 --> 01:40:19,658
. .who has disgraced the village.

1177
01:40:19,742 --> 01:40:21,733
And blemished landlord's reputation.

1178
01:40:22,422 --> 01:40:25,141
Have I killed anyone?
Or robbed anyone?

1179
01:40:25,422 --> 01:40:27,731
Shut up! Gama will answer.

1180
01:40:27,822 --> 01:40:28,937
Why would he answer?

1181
01:40:29,022 --> 01:40:31,138
I am being accused. I will answer.

1182
01:40:31,222 --> 01:40:33,133
How dare you open your mouth?

1183
01:40:33,222 --> 01:40:36,180
Didn't you try to elope
with the landlord's daughter?

1184
01:40:38,542 --> 01:40:42,091
This boy didn't elope
with that girl forcibly.

1185
01:40:42,502 --> 01:40:44,811
And nor did he do
anything untoward with her.

1186
01:40:45,462 --> 01:40:49,171
That girl had left
her house willingly.

1187
01:40:49,622 --> 01:40:52,011
Because they love each other. .

1188
01:40:52,622 --> 01:40:54,340
. .and want to get married.

1189
01:40:54,542 --> 01:40:56,897
And if it's a crime to get married. .

1190
01:40:57,342 --> 01:41:02,132
. . not just this boy, but
that girl is equally culprit.

1191
01:41:02,502 --> 01:41:03,776
Gama is right.

1192
01:41:03,862 --> 01:41:06,057
You don't know the old man is clever.

1193
01:41:06,142 --> 01:41:08,417
He is fooling us with his sweet talks.

1194
01:41:08,502 --> 01:41:10,652
This is not the way to talk to him.

1195
01:41:11,782 --> 01:41:14,012
Then what's the right way, kid?

1196
01:41:14,342 --> 01:41:16,537
Bash up the boy and
throw him out of the village.

1197
01:41:16,622 --> 01:41:19,534
The decision will be made.
- Yes. Hit him!

1198
01:41:19,622 --> 01:41:20,691
Wait!
- Bash him.

1199
01:41:20,782 --> 01:41:24,570
If anyone tries to harm the boy,
I will break his bones.

1200
01:41:24,662 --> 01:41:25,981
Hit him.
- Move!

1201
01:41:27,542 --> 01:41:31,012
It is easy to have an
enmity with the villagers. .

1202
01:41:31,262 --> 01:41:33,696
. . but remember you are alone.

1203
01:41:33,902 --> 01:41:37,178
If you die, you won't
even get funeral rites.

1204
01:41:41,702 --> 01:41:45,695
I was born here and will die here.

1205
01:41:46,982 --> 01:41:51,533
You're not required
for my funeral rites.

1206
01:41:54,862 --> 01:41:56,454
Don't think I am all alone.

1207
01:41:58,102 --> 01:42:00,411
I have my son with me.

1208
01:42:01,822 --> 01:42:02,891
Shekhar.

1209
01:42:05,022 --> 01:42:06,694
He will carry my coffin.

1210
01:42:07,822 --> 01:42:09,460
He will light my pyre.

1211
01:42:11,102 --> 01:42:14,458
My son will stay here with me.

1212
01:42:15,902 --> 01:42:20,817
Let me see who has the guts, to
stop him from staying with me.

1213
01:42:22,462 --> 01:42:23,577
Come, son.

1214
01:42:27,462 --> 01:42:28,781
Come, son. Come.

1215
01:42:31,502 --> 01:42:36,451
Be ashamed ! He disgraced and
humiliated the entire village.

1216
01:42:36,542 --> 01:42:38,772
And you could not do a thing.

1217
01:42:42,862 --> 01:42:44,500
They will summon the village council.

1218
01:42:45,742 --> 01:42:47,300
They will summon the village council.

1219
01:42:50,022 --> 01:42:53,571
I am the doctor of this village.

1220
01:42:54,462 --> 01:42:58,375
I know every person in
this village very well.

1221
01:42:59,182 --> 01:43:04,461
They will summon me in
the council and examine me.

1222
01:43:05,702 --> 01:43:06,851
Village council.

1223
01:43:07,662 --> 01:43:12,782
Sir, when a man dies, the dog barks.

1224
01:43:14,742 --> 01:43:16,095
Let them bark.

1225
01:43:16,902 --> 01:43:20,099
You drink and let me drink too.
- Here.

1226
01:43:20,182 --> 01:43:21,297
Who is it?

1227
01:43:21,782 --> 01:43:23,818
You are thinking of yourself.

1228
01:43:24,262 --> 01:43:27,857
But what about the one for whom
the village council was summoned?

1229
01:43:28,822 --> 01:43:30,494
Uncle Gama, I am speaking the truth.

1230
01:43:30,942 --> 01:43:32,136
I am not intoxicated.

1231
01:43:32,942 --> 01:43:34,455
If I don't get Rupa. .

1232
01:43:36,262 --> 01:43:39,015
. .I will die like Romeo.

1233
01:43:39,342 --> 01:43:43,335
''Listen, have mercy on him. ''

1234
01:43:43,422 --> 01:43:45,219
''Yes! ''

1235
01:43:45,422 --> 01:43:49,813
''Help him to meet his Juliet. ''

1236
01:43:49,942 --> 01:43:51,819
''Yes! ''

1237
01:43:51,902 --> 01:43:57,181

''Yes! ''

1239

''Let's think about it. ''

1247
01:45:09,142 --> 01:45:18,255
''When it was time to get married,
the girl objected. ''

1248
01:45:18,662 --> 01:45:27,616
''The girl's father became a hurdle.
He wouldn't let us meet. ''

1249
01:45:27,822 --> 01:45:31,861
''Either kill me or let us become one. ''

1250
01:45:32,022 --> 01:45:35,731

live without love. ''

will do something untoward. ''

1256
01:46:23,782 --> 01:46:32,451
''I will commit
suicide at your threshold. ''

1257
01:46:32,662 --> 01:46:36,655
''Now, don't delay. Come, my dear. ''

1258
01:46:36,822 --> 01:46:40,371

1263

If you meet filthy women,
you will get filthy diseases.

1264
01:48:10,222 --> 01:48:13,851
And the one who marries. .

1265
01:48:14,582 --> 01:48:16,459
. .you will also get the same disease.

1266
01:48:17,062 --> 01:48:21,340
Speak softy! If anyone hears,
I will be defamed.

1267
01:48:21,422 --> 01:48:25,381
I am not telling you anything.
I am just publishing my medicine.

1268
01:48:25,462 --> 01:48:26,975
Uncle wrestler.

1269
01:48:27,542 --> 01:48:30,420
I have told you often
to call me uncle Gama.

1270
01:48:30,502 --> 01:48:33,062
Uncle Gama, come with me.
Rupa is calling you.

1271
01:48:33,142 --> 01:48:34,939
What is the urgency?

1272
01:48:35,022 --> 01:48:36,774
Come. I will tell you on the way.

1273
01:48:37,022 --> 01:48:39,456
Okay, first let me give him medicine.

1274
01:48:39,782 --> 01:48:40,897
What is wrong with him?

1275
01:48:41,742 --> 01:48:45,530
Actually he went to. .

1276
01:48:45,622 --> 01:48:49,297
I went to see a movie, 'Secret
knowledge. ' I fell from the stairs.

1277
01:48:49,382 --> 01:48:51,293
And I got hurt at a secret place.

1278
01:48:51,982 --> 01:48:53,415
How much do I owe you?

1279
01:48:53,622 --> 01:48:55,931
Rs. 50. .
- 50 !

1280
01:48:56,342 --> 01:48:58,731
Earlier you used to
take me only Rs. 5. .

1281
01:48:59,222 --> 01:49:00,974
Earlier this girl was not here.

1282
01:49:01,062 --> 01:49:03,132
Girl, listen.

1283
01:49:03,222 --> 01:49:06,294
Go ahead. I will send him. Go.

1284
01:49:07,942 --> 01:49:11,218
Take Rs. 5.

1285
01:49:12,342 --> 01:49:16,255
Listen, girl.
- No.

1286
01:49:16,622 --> 01:49:17,737
Listen.

1287
01:49:18,222 --> 01:49:19,940
Give me the medicine.
- Here.

1288
01:49:20,022 --> 01:49:22,616
I will get well?
- Yes. It will fall automatically.

1289
01:49:22,702 --> 01:49:23,851
Okay.

1290
01:49:26,942 --> 01:49:31,857
Your daughter is very
decent and beautiful, landlord.

1291
01:49:32,222 --> 01:49:35,692
Find an auspicious
date for the marriage.

1292
01:49:36,182 --> 01:49:38,412
We accept this alliance.

1293
01:49:54,422 --> 01:49:57,892
Dwarf, what's the matter?
Why are you crying?

1294
01:50:01,062 --> 01:50:03,212
What's the matter?
Will you say something?

1295
01:50:04,142 --> 01:50:08,374
Sir, you'll have to
shave your half moustache.

1296
01:50:08,862 --> 01:50:10,056
What nonsense!

1297
01:50:10,382 --> 01:50:14,261
Some people have come
with an alliance for Rupa.

1298
01:50:14,902 --> 01:50:18,451
What?
- Yes.

1299
01:50:22,022 --> 01:50:25,298
Don't cry. I will handle everything.

1300
01:51:04,982 --> 01:51:08,418
Come, Mr. Ghanshyam.
I was waiting for you.

1301
01:51:09,062 --> 01:51:10,177
Ghanshyam.

1302
01:51:11,142 --> 01:51:12,814
Landlord, if we had gone through. .

1303
01:51:12,902 --> 01:51:15,336
. .some other place, it
would've been better.

1304
01:51:15,862 --> 01:51:17,580
We wouldn't have seen your face.

1305
01:51:17,902 --> 01:51:19,096
What have I done?

1306
01:51:19,182 --> 01:51:20,581
Ask yourself.

1307
01:51:21,142 --> 01:51:23,292
Your daughter has a very bad name.

1308
01:51:23,382 --> 01:51:24,940
And you wanted her to
become my daughter-in-law.

1309
01:51:25,022 --> 01:51:26,819
She had eloped once. .

1310
01:51:26,902 --> 01:51:29,496
. .and I have heard that
boy is in this village.

1311
01:51:29,582 --> 01:51:32,619
Wasn't it your duty to
tell us everything clearly?

1312
01:51:32,702 --> 01:51:35,170
After marriage if. .
- Uncle, don't argue.

1313
01:51:35,742 --> 01:51:39,132
Don't ruin the mood as we've to
go to meet someone else. Come.

1314
01:52:00,742 --> 01:52:02,858
Get out!
- Father, what are you doing?

1315
01:52:02,942 --> 01:52:06,855
Leave me. - Get out.
And elope with that boy, wretched.

1316
01:52:06,942 --> 01:52:08,534
What are you doing?
- If this is your destiny. .

1317
01:52:08,622 --> 01:52:09,850
Move!
- No!

1318
01:52:09,942 --> 01:52:11,660
If that's your destiny. .

1319
01:52:11,982 --> 01:52:14,621
. .why did you return? Get out.
- Listen to me.

1320
01:52:14,702 --> 01:52:18,456
Don't dishonour us. Get out.

1321
01:52:21,222 --> 01:52:22,814
That's enough, Mr. Chaudhary.

1322
01:52:23,182 --> 01:52:26,015
Till now I was quiet. But not anymore.

1323
01:52:26,102 --> 01:52:29,412
No! What right do you have
to interfere in our matters?

1324
01:52:29,502 --> 01:52:32,539
What are you to me?
What's our relationship?

1325
01:52:32,622 --> 01:52:35,341
He is my father. Even
if he takes my life. .

1326
01:52:35,422 --> 01:52:37,697
. .who are you to
interfere in our matters?

1327
01:52:37,982 --> 01:52:39,097
Get out.

1328
01:52:40,342 --> 01:52:42,572
Why are you ruining our family?

1329
01:52:42,822 --> 01:52:44,494
Why are you staying in this village?

1330
01:52:44,582 --> 01:52:46,459
For your happiness. .
- For my happiness.

1331
01:52:46,662 --> 01:52:48,095
What happiness have you given me?

1332
01:52:48,342 --> 01:52:50,219
You have shattered my life.

1333
01:52:50,502 --> 01:52:53,653
If you want to see me happy,
leave this village.

1334
01:52:53,822 --> 01:52:56,700
Go away my life.

1335
01:52:57,302 --> 01:52:59,736
I can't bear to see
you even for a moment.

1336
01:52:59,982 --> 01:53:02,450
I hate you !

1337
01:53:06,982 --> 01:53:13,899
''You must forget me like this. ''

1338
01:53:14,182 --> 01:53:22,294
''The way dreams are
forgotten in the morning. ''

1339
01:53:22,382 --> 01:53:29,333
''You must forget me like this. ''

1340
01:53:29,702 --> 01:53:37,256
''The way dreams are
forgotten in the morning. ''

1341
01:53:38,422 --> 01:53:47,057
''I will forget myself,
only then I can forget you. ''

1342
01:53:47,262 --> 01:53:54,293
''Tears are flowing,
they are waiting to meet. ''

1343
01:53:54,382 --> 01:53:59,217
''I can't endure the separation. ''

1344
01:53:59,542 --> 01:54:08,371
''I will forget myself,
only then I can forget you. ''

1345
01:54:08,462 --> 01:54:15,413
''Tears are flowing,
they are waiting to meet. ''

1346
01:54:15,502 --> 01:54:21,020
''I can't endure the separation. ''

1347
01:54:53,982 --> 01:54:56,416
Son-in-law! Where are you going?

1348
01:54:56,702 --> 01:54:58,772
I am going. I am leaving this village.

1349
01:54:58,982 --> 01:55:04,215
You can't leave the
village before Rupa's problem. .

1350
01:55:04,702 --> 01:55:06,533
. .gets solved. .

1351
01:55:06,982 --> 01:55:09,655
. .whether the decision is in
your favour or against you.

1352
01:55:09,742 --> 01:55:14,258
The decision should be in by
Rupa's favour and for her happiness.

1353
01:55:15,102 --> 01:55:16,251
That's why I am leaving.

1354
01:55:22,182 --> 01:55:25,140
It's fine if you don't
care about your dignity.

1355
01:55:25,622 --> 01:55:26,850
But I do.

1356
01:55:27,622 --> 01:55:28,896
Don't be angry, uncle.

1357
01:55:30,062 --> 01:55:33,816
For this egoistic Chaudhary
has harassed his daughter.

1358
01:55:34,022 --> 01:55:35,091
And now. .

1359
01:55:40,742 --> 01:55:44,098
Listen carefully, you
won't leave the village.

1360
01:55:48,502 --> 01:55:49,821
Don't be angry.

1361
01:55:50,542 --> 01:55:51,861
I am doing this for
everyone's welfare.

1362
01:55:52,782 --> 01:55:53,851
Let me go.

1363
01:55:56,542 --> 01:56:01,252
Uncle, in the village
council you called me a son.

1364
01:56:02,582 --> 01:56:04,334
You may have said it unknowingly or. .

1365
01:56:04,422 --> 01:56:07,732
. .with excitement, but
I thought it was true.

1366
01:56:07,942 --> 01:56:10,376
Forget this father's
and son's relationship.

1367
01:56:10,822 --> 01:56:13,461
Before leaving, first decide with me.

1368
01:56:21,022 --> 01:56:23,013
You fleeing from this village. .

1369
01:56:23,622 --> 01:56:26,500
. . is not your
sacrifice for Rupa or love. .

1370
01:56:27,382 --> 01:56:29,054
. . but it is your cowardice.

1371
01:56:29,582 --> 01:56:33,211
Hit me. Fool !

1372
01:56:34,662 --> 01:56:36,732
I am indebted to you as
you called me your son.

1373
01:56:37,782 --> 01:56:41,092
Now even if you kill me,
I won't hit you.

1374
01:56:41,902 --> 01:56:43,699
Don't lecture me.

1375
01:56:53,822 --> 01:56:56,097
Uncle! Uncle.

1376
01:56:56,822 --> 01:56:57,937
Uncle!

1377
01:57:02,182 --> 01:57:03,297
Shekhar. .

1378
01:57:04,862 --> 01:57:10,255
. . if it had been my own son,
he too might have hit me.

1379
01:57:11,822 --> 01:57:16,976
But I hit you so much still
you didn't raise your hand.

1380
01:57:17,182 --> 01:57:18,297
Borne it all.

1381
01:57:21,302 --> 01:57:24,692
Son, you can go now.

1382
01:57:25,742 --> 01:57:26,891
I won't stop you.

1383
01:57:27,822 --> 01:57:30,939
Do me a favour.

1384
01:57:31,902 --> 01:57:35,133
I go to a tomb every full moon night. .

1385
01:57:36,342 --> 01:57:39,015
. .and light a candle
and offer flowers there.

1386
01:57:40,542 --> 01:57:41,975
Take me there, son.

1387
01:57:42,982 --> 01:57:44,973
Will you take me there?
- Yes.

1388
01:58:00,982 --> 01:58:06,420
All my youthful dreams
are buried in this tomb.

1389
01:58:09,942 --> 01:58:11,216
I too had a Rupa.

1390
01:58:13,102 --> 01:58:14,376
Like your Rupa.

1391
01:58:16,302 --> 01:58:18,133
This happened 30 years ago.

1392
01:58:19,902 --> 01:58:23,781
I went through the same thing
which you are going through.

1393
01:58:25,462 --> 01:58:30,092
She sacrificed her love
for her parents' wishes.

1394
01:58:31,222 --> 01:58:32,940
And I left her like you.

1395
01:58:33,542 --> 01:58:36,739
I know it was her wish and
she would be happy about it.

1396
01:58:39,142 --> 01:58:40,257
She got married.

1397
01:58:41,622 --> 01:58:43,817
She married where her
parents wished her to marry.

1398
01:58:44,822 --> 01:58:47,211
The same night. On the first night. .

1399
01:58:55,702 --> 01:58:57,135
She committed suicide.

1400
01:59:07,542 --> 01:59:08,816
I never got married.

1401
01:59:10,222 --> 01:59:11,780
But I decided that. .

1402
01:59:13,022 --> 01:59:18,733
. .I won't allow any girl
like Surekha to commit suicide.

1403
01:59:19,422 --> 01:59:21,174
That's why I am asking you not to go.

1404
01:59:22,102 --> 01:59:26,061
Don't leave Rupa or
she might commit suicide.

1405
01:59:26,622 --> 01:59:27,737
Don't go.

1406
01:59:37,822 --> 01:59:40,256
Mother, without
consulting anyone he printed. .

1407
01:59:40,342 --> 01:59:42,651
. .the wedding invitation.
- What are you saying?

1408
01:59:43,222 --> 01:59:46,771
At least find out who the boy is.

1409
01:59:47,102 --> 01:59:48,217
Go.

1410
01:59:54,022 --> 01:59:55,819
Distribute this card.
- Yes, uncle.

1411
01:59:58,902 --> 02:00:01,018
Whose wedding cards
are you distributing?

1412
02:00:01,702 --> 02:00:02,817
Rupa's.

1413
02:00:05,622 --> 02:00:07,055
You didn't ask who the boy is.

1414
02:00:09,182 --> 02:00:11,298
He is standing in
front of you. Atmaram.

1415
02:00:14,822 --> 02:00:19,020
A loafer. Have you gone craZy?

1416
02:00:19,942 --> 02:00:22,740
The whole world knows
about your grand-daughter.

1417
02:00:23,902 --> 02:00:25,460
Which gentleman will marry her?

1418
02:00:26,502 --> 02:00:29,141
Be grateful she won't be
spinster all her life.

1419
02:00:29,222 --> 02:00:32,259
Did you raise her up
to send her to hell?

1420
02:00:36,462 --> 02:00:39,340
What are you doing here,
fool? Go away.

1421
02:00:41,342 --> 02:00:46,496
Uncle, the first card should
be given to a special person?

1422
02:00:46,822 --> 02:00:48,301
Which whom should I begin?

1423
02:00:51,462 --> 02:00:52,577
I know that.

1424
02:00:54,782 --> 02:00:56,454
Is Gama home?
- Yes.

1425
02:00:56,662 --> 02:00:58,175
But today he has taken vow of silence.

1426
02:01:04,462 --> 02:01:05,577
No, I have not come to sit.

1427
02:01:06,222 --> 02:01:08,895
I have come to say there is
a happy occasion in my house.

1428
02:01:10,382 --> 02:01:12,338
You are our special relative?

1429
02:01:13,582 --> 02:01:15,015
How can you be forgotten?

1430
02:01:19,302 --> 02:01:21,099
Today I am getting Rupa married.

1431
02:01:22,422 --> 02:01:25,698
The boy is good. From our community.

1432
02:01:26,742 --> 02:01:27,811
Atmaram!

1433
02:01:30,582 --> 02:01:35,451
The one who marries you will
also die of the same disease.

1434
02:01:38,382 --> 02:01:39,451
It's the matter of joy.

1435
02:01:41,462 --> 02:01:42,656
Do come for the wedding.

1436
02:01:49,142 --> 02:01:50,211
Chaudhary. .

1437
02:01:51,902 --> 02:01:55,781
. .you very well know I never
broke my vow in these 30 years.

1438
02:01:56,742 --> 02:01:58,937
Today I can't keep silent.

1439
02:01:59,822 --> 02:02:01,255
Rupa is like a daughter to me.

1440
02:02:02,102 --> 02:02:04,013
You can't get her married to Atmaram.

1441
02:02:04,622 --> 02:02:06,294
He has a very serious disease.

1442
02:02:07,582 --> 02:02:10,221
Until yesterday you broke the
marriage talking ill of my daughter.

1443
02:02:11,142 --> 02:02:14,452
Today when you can't do anything
else you are talking ill of the boy.

1444
02:02:15,382 --> 02:02:19,011
Chaudhary, I have
treated Atmaram myself.

1445
02:02:19,102 --> 02:02:21,013
He has a serious disease.

1446
02:02:21,822 --> 02:02:25,292
If Rupa gets married to him,
her life will be destroyed.

1447
02:02:25,422 --> 02:02:28,095
She will die with his disease.
No, Chaudhary.

1448
02:02:28,382 --> 02:02:32,455
Your threat didn't work so
you are begging like a woman.

1449
02:02:33,582 --> 02:02:36,096
You are very weak, wrestler.
- I beg of you.

1450
02:02:36,222 --> 02:02:38,656
Chaudhary. No, Chaudhary!

1451
02:02:38,782 --> 02:02:41,250
No, Chaudhary!

1452
02:02:42,582 --> 02:02:43,651
Chaudhary!

1453
02:02:59,582 --> 02:03:00,651
Don't cry, uncle.

1454
02:03:01,142 --> 02:03:03,098
Your tears can't
affect a heartless person.

1455
02:03:04,182 --> 02:03:05,456
This wedding won't take place.

1456
02:03:06,302 --> 02:03:08,133
I won't allow Rupa
to die unnecessarily. .

1457
02:03:08,622 --> 02:03:10,021
. .even if I lose my life.

1458
02:03:11,782 --> 02:03:14,296
Get aside!

1459
02:04:25,102 --> 02:04:28,219
Why don't you speak?
Why are you quiet?

1460
02:04:28,622 --> 02:04:33,935
If you have some courage send
your daughter with that boy. .

1461
02:04:34,302 --> 02:04:38,580
. .or kill her yourself.

1462
02:05:02,582 --> 02:05:04,300
Come. Stand up.

1463
02:05:04,582 --> 02:05:06,140
Elope with that boy.

1464
02:05:06,622 --> 02:05:08,021
I will take care of your father.

1465
02:05:08,262 --> 02:05:09,331
Come on. Go!

1466
02:05:09,462 --> 02:05:14,456
No, mother. If I step out of this
house, father will kill himself.

1467
02:05:14,742 --> 02:05:18,451
No! - For his stubbornness, why
are you ruining your life, dear?

1468
02:05:19,342 --> 02:05:24,018
He was born stubborn.
Nobody knows him better than me.

1469
02:05:24,782 --> 02:05:26,579
I know him from the past 30 years.

1470
02:05:27,462 --> 02:05:32,695
But he never consulted me
for anything all these years.

1471
02:05:32,822 --> 02:05:34,221
Never asked my opinion.

1472
02:05:34,742 --> 02:05:37,939
I thought it was my destiny. .

1473
02:05:38,582 --> 02:05:41,016
. .to endure everything
even if he was wrong.

1474
02:05:41,982 --> 02:05:44,621
I will beg of him.

1475
02:05:44,862 --> 02:05:49,219
Dear, it's our reverence
that turns stones into idols.

1476
02:05:49,462 --> 02:05:53,341
Without it, it is just a stone.

1477
02:05:53,622 --> 02:05:57,376
You've respected your father enough.
Now it's his turn.

1478
02:05:57,462 --> 02:06:00,932
Yes. - If he doesn't understand,
forget him.

1479
02:06:01,062 --> 02:06:02,780
Go quickly. Go!

1480
02:06:03,582 --> 02:06:04,651
Just think it over.

1481
02:06:05,262 --> 02:06:08,572
It will be a great sin when
you will physically be with. .

1482
02:06:08,662 --> 02:06:12,098
. .someone and
emotionally with someone else.

1483
02:06:12,742 --> 02:06:13,811
No!

1484
02:06:13,942 --> 02:06:15,898
Even prostitutes don't do such things.

1485
02:06:16,862 --> 02:06:19,774
Go. I will take you to Shekhar.

1486
02:06:19,902 --> 02:06:21,017
Come on.

1487
02:06:52,742 --> 02:06:55,461
Aren't you ashamed to slap a woman?

1488
02:06:56,342 --> 02:06:58,014
Now don't leave any stones unturned.

1489
02:06:58,902 --> 02:07:03,339
You're about to kill your daughter.
Now strangle us too.

1490
02:07:03,702 --> 02:07:05,693
So that you can live in peace.

1491
02:07:07,302 --> 02:07:08,894
Don't say anything to him, mother.

1492
02:07:09,942 --> 02:07:11,455
He won't listen to anything.

1493
02:07:12,822 --> 02:07:15,939
He always did what he wanted.
He will continue to do so.

1494
02:07:17,102 --> 02:07:22,335
As he is a man, he
doesn't respect woman.

1495
02:07:22,982 --> 02:07:29,012
That's why he didn't even tell
me whom my daughter was marrying.

1496
02:07:30,302 --> 02:07:32,452
Don't I have any right on my daughter?

1497
02:07:33,822 --> 02:07:36,017
After all I am her mother.

1498
02:07:36,302 --> 02:07:37,621
You call yourself a mother.

1499
02:07:38,582 --> 02:07:41,699
And you are leading her to a
life where she can't face others.

1500
02:07:41,822 --> 02:07:45,371
She can face others
only when she is alive.

1501
02:07:46,382 --> 02:07:48,942
You are getting him married to a man. .

1502
02:07:49,462 --> 02:07:51,692
. .who can lead her only to death.

1503
02:07:52,182 --> 02:07:58,098
I can endure anything. But
not my daughter's death.

1504
02:07:59,302 --> 02:08:03,136
I carried her in my
womb for nine months.

1505
02:08:03,302 --> 02:08:05,452
I know what is a
father's duty and love.

1506
02:08:05,582 --> 02:08:06,901
What do you know?

1507
02:08:07,342 --> 02:08:10,220
Don't you know Rupa is
madly in love with Shekhar?

1508
02:08:10,582 --> 02:08:12,220
What is wrong with him?

1509
02:08:12,742 --> 02:08:16,337
He loves Rupa so much that he
has sacrificed everything for her.

1510
02:08:16,462 --> 02:08:20,933
But you don't want to get them
married for your stubbornness.

1511
02:08:21,062 --> 02:08:24,771
You can think what you please. So?

1512
02:08:24,902 --> 02:08:26,335
Still you call it love.

1513
02:08:27,022 --> 02:08:30,378
No. This is not a father's love.

1514
02:08:31,182 --> 02:08:33,616
But a man's ego.

1515
02:08:34,462 --> 02:08:37,579
If you want to learn how
to love, learn it from Rupa.

1516
02:08:38,302 --> 02:08:43,171
For her father's ego, she
even sacrificed her love.

1517
02:08:43,422 --> 02:08:45,458
Enough. Or. .

1518
02:08:45,582 --> 02:08:46,731
Or else what will you do?

1519
02:08:47,342 --> 02:08:51,301
You have already slapped.
Now kill me too.

1520
02:08:51,742 --> 02:08:54,654
Kill me. Strangle me. I say kill me.

1521
02:09:25,862 --> 02:09:26,931
Stop!

1522
02:09:27,182 --> 02:09:29,457
Uncle.

1523
02:09:31,182 --> 02:09:33,093
Stop him, uncle.

1524
02:09:33,222 --> 02:09:35,338
See what he has done to me
and to the wedding dais.

1525
02:09:35,462 --> 02:09:37,214
We're not in the state for
solemniZing the wedding.

1526
02:09:37,342 --> 02:09:40,459
He threatened me saying,
''Let me see how you marry Rupa. ''

1527
02:09:44,382 --> 02:09:47,738
Who can stop Rupa's marriage today?
- Yes.

1528
02:09:47,862 --> 02:09:49,580
Whatever I have decided is final.

1529
02:09:49,982 --> 02:09:54,021
No power can force me
to change my decision.

1530
02:10:07,102 --> 02:10:09,457
Rupa, come here.

1531
02:10:16,902 --> 02:10:17,971
Come.

1532
02:10:28,582 --> 02:10:31,096
Priest, proceed with the ceremony.

1533
02:10:54,462 --> 02:10:56,214
Uncle, what is this?

1534
02:10:57,222 --> 02:10:58,291
Yes. .

1535
02:10:59,782 --> 02:11:03,570
. . my Rupa will marry Shekhar.

1536
02:11:05,742 --> 02:11:07,653
My dear.
- Father.

1537
02:11:13,582 --> 02:11:19,452
Shakuntala, sometimes a man in
his pride and ego gets so blind. .

1538
02:11:20,382 --> 02:11:23,454
. .that he cannot
differentiate between right and wrong.

1539
02:11:24,982 --> 02:11:26,381
Your maternal love made me. .

1540
02:11:28,222 --> 02:11:31,931
. . remember my duty as a father.

1541
02:11:32,102 --> 02:11:33,171
No, uncle.

1542
02:11:33,382 --> 02:11:34,576
You cannot do this.

1543
02:11:34,822 --> 02:11:38,258
Rupa will get married to me.
The card has my name.

1544
02:11:38,382 --> 02:11:39,940
So I will sit for the ceremony.

1545
02:11:41,142 --> 02:11:42,211
Son. .

1546
02:11:44,022 --> 02:11:45,933
. .they love each other a lot.

1547
02:11:46,982 --> 02:11:48,210
Don't snatch their happiness.

1548
02:11:49,902 --> 02:11:52,894
I take the
responsibility and I promise. .

1549
02:11:53,982 --> 02:11:58,180
. .to get you married to a good girl.

1550
02:11:58,342 --> 02:12:01,812
Uncle, I'm not so wise.

1551
02:12:01,982 --> 02:12:03,938
Once I decide something,
I stick to it.

1552
02:12:04,262 --> 02:12:06,378
Rupa will marry only me.

1553
02:12:06,462 --> 02:12:08,020
Let me see who stops me.

1554
02:12:08,342 --> 02:12:09,741
No!
- Move!

1555
02:12:09,822 --> 02:12:12,336
No.
- Come. - Leave her! - No!

1556
02:12:15,182 --> 02:12:17,901
How dare you?

1557
02:12:18,742 --> 02:12:21,939
I am Rupa's father. I will get
her married where I want to.

1558
02:12:22,782 --> 02:12:24,295
Let me see who stops me.

1559
02:12:26,702 --> 02:12:28,613
Come on. Come.

1560
02:13:06,182 --> 02:13:07,934
Sit here.

1561
02:13:08,662 --> 02:13:12,701
Hit him!

1562
02:13:17,222 --> 02:13:18,575
You're bleeding profusely.

1563
02:13:18,782 --> 02:13:21,580
It's a sign of manhood.

1564
02:13:21,662 --> 02:13:24,301
But you showed you are a true man. .

1565
02:13:24,382 --> 02:13:26,850
. . by saving my
moustache from getting shaved.

1566
02:13:27,382 --> 02:13:28,576
Gama.
- Yes?

1567
02:13:29,022 --> 02:13:32,776
Give away the bride and make me happy.

1568
02:13:32,902 --> 02:13:35,894
Anyone of you can give the bride away.

1569
02:13:36,022 --> 02:13:38,820
But we will take home our
daughter-in-law without dowry.

1570
02:13:39,742 --> 02:13:41,175
Say it. Why don't you speak?

1571
02:13:41,302 --> 02:13:43,452
Yes. We'll take her without dowry.

1572
02:13:45,462 --> 02:13:56,020
''Neither wealth nor strength,
but we need love to live. ''

1573
02:13:56,142 --> 02:13:59,214
''Love! Love! ''

1574
02:14:00,102 --> 02:14:03,253
''Love! Love! ''

1575
02:14:04,262 --> 02:14:07,334
''Love! Love! ''

1576
02:14:08,422 --> 02:14:13,416
''Love! Love! ''
