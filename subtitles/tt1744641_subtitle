My Friend, our story begins long ago..

5
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:11,914
..when the Kingdom of Kosal was ruled by the great King Dashrath.

6
00:03:12,673 --> 00:03:14,953
The mighty Dashrath..

7
00:03:15,034 --> 00:03:17,034
..lived peacefully with his three beautiful wives..

8
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:19,354
..in his capital, Ayodhya.

9
00:03:19,513 --> 00:03:24,469
He had all that he desired, all.. except children.

10
00:03:25,673 --> 00:03:29,313
It was the only pleasure that God had deprived him off.

11
00:03:29,874 --> 00:03:33,394
Upon advice from the royal sage..

12
00:03:33,731 --> 00:03:35,673
..he performed ritual to obtain a son.

13
00:03:36,009 --> 00:03:38,113
On completing the ritual.

14
00:03:38,456 --> 00:03:42,673
King Dashrath was blessed with four hand some sons.

15
00:03:43,863 --> 00:03:47,534
Ram from Queen Kaushalya, Bharat from Kaykai..

16
00:03:47,726 --> 00:03:51,194
..and Sumitra's Laxman and Shatrughna.

17
00:03:52,154 --> 00:03:59,637
Over time, Ram's reputations brave warrior spread far and wide.

18
00:04:00,474 --> 00:04:01,985
So much so..

19
00:04:02,285 --> 00:04:04,376
..that the great sage Vishvamitr..

20
00:04:04,816 --> 00:04:09,696
..requested King Dashrath to send Ram..

21
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:13,687
..to protect his scared ritual from the dangerous demons, Tadka.

22
00:05:03,699 --> 00:05:04,749
After this.

23
00:05:05,192 --> 00:05:10,515
Sage Vishvamitr took Ram and Laxman to the Kingdom of Mithila..

24
00:05:12,295 --> 00:05:15,353
..where King Janak was hosting, a swayamwar..

25
00:05:15,434 --> 00:05:17,808
..a marriage contest to select a husband for his daughter, Sita.

26
00:05:18,134 --> 00:05:22,873
The go al of the contest was to string the majestic bow..

27
00:05:22,953 --> 00:05:25,634
..of lord Shiva in order to win Sita's hand in marriage.

28
00:05:26,393 --> 00:05:28,242
Brave and mighty princes from all over India..

29
00:05:28,482 --> 00:05:30,614
..could not even move it..

30
00:05:34,393 --> 00:05:37,194
The King of Himpur, the mighty Rohit Kumar,

31
00:05:37,381 --> 00:05:41,393
..is now approaching the podium.

32
00:06:13,927 --> 00:06:18,833
The mighty, Rohit Kumar, has failed the test!

33
00:06:21,359 --> 00:06:24,091
As a child my daughter Sita..

34
00:06:24,391 --> 00:06:26,761
..would lift this bow with such ease..

35
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:31,353
..is there no prince, strong enough to even string it now..

36
00:06:32,203 --> 00:06:34,354
Is there no warrior in this world..

37
00:06:34,434 --> 00:06:37,114
..capable of winning my daughter's hand?

38
00:07:03,547 --> 00:07:07,874
I, the King of Mithila, Janak, with great sadness, announce..

39
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:13,713
..the closing of the contest of my daughter Sita's marriage.

40
00:07:13,994 --> 00:07:19,196
Because there is no man on this earth worthy of her hand.

41
00:07:19,275 --> 00:07:20,353
Wait!

42
00:07:21,922 --> 00:07:24,273
This earth is not devoid of brave warriors!

43
00:07:25,033 --> 00:07:28,353
As long as the son's of Dashrath live.

44
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:31,994
My brother Ram, has slain the ferocious Tadka!

45
00:08:58,194 --> 00:08:59,429
Congratulations!

46
00:08:59,723 --> 00:09:03,116
Lord Ram, the son of Dashrath has won..

47
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:07,353
..King Janak's daughter, Sita's hand in marriage!

48
00:09:16,314 --> 00:09:22,776
Ram and Sita's marriage showered good fortune all over Ayodhya,

49
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:25,553
Laxman, Bharat and Shatrughna..

50
00:09:25,633 --> 00:09:28,153
..also got married to Sita's sisters,

51
00:09:28,334 --> 00:09:32,840
Urmilla, Mandvi and Shruta Kirti.

52
00:09:33,353 --> 00:09:37,473
Ayodhya had never seen such happiness before.

53
00:09:38,402 --> 00:09:40,074
The entire kingdom celebrated.

54
00:09:40,592 --> 00:09:42,473
Everything was in order.

55
00:09:43,147 --> 00:09:47,553
The people now looked to Ram, as the future king of Ayodhya.

56
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:50,918
King Dashrath was growing old.

57
00:09:53,132 --> 00:09:58,492
Kaykai.. I think Ram is now ready, to take over Ayodhya.

58
00:09:59,154 --> 00:10:01,314
I should retire now..

59
00:10:01,454 --> 00:10:03,194
You're right, my Lord.

60
00:10:03,914 --> 00:10:05,621
And this is the right time, too..

61
00:10:05,993 --> 00:10:08,309
..for the an no uncomment of your successor.

62
00:10:09,154 --> 00:10:12,034
And, Ram will be the best choice.

63
00:10:12,113 --> 00:10:14,633
But Bharat and Shatrughna are not here!

64
00:10:14,713 --> 00:10:18,113
So what.. Ram is the eldest and he..

65
00:10:18,873 --> 00:10:22,314
He has all the qualities of a King.

66
00:10:22,593 --> 00:10:24,393
I'll make the announcement today.

67
00:10:24,947 --> 00:10:27,994
Hear One!.. Hear All!..

68
00:10:28,139 --> 00:10:33,514
I have great news to the people of Ayodhya!

69
00:10:33,794 --> 00:10:37,554
The King of Kings, the mighty Dashrath..

70
00:10:37,633 --> 00:10:42,553
..has decided to crown the Prince Ram as King!!!

71
00:10:52,689 --> 00:10:57,453
Please accept my greetings, oh future queen of Ayodhya.

72
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:06,154
What's wrong my Queen.. Have I hurt you in some way?

73
00:11:07,394 --> 00:11:09,022
How can I trust a prince?

74
00:11:10,274 --> 00:11:12,178
Tomorrow you may find someone more beautiful..

75
00:11:12,689 --> 00:11:14,393
then she will be your Queen.

76
00:11:17,554 --> 00:11:19,295
Why do you say that Sita?

77
00:11:22,074 --> 00:11:24,382
I know that this plight can be unbearable for a woman.

78
00:11:25,514 --> 00:11:28,794
I have seen my own mother suffer through all of these miseries.

79
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:32,683
I know, the other woman in the house is like poison.

80
00:11:33,376 --> 00:11:37,001
You don't know Sita, but long ago,

81
00:11:37,161 --> 00:11:40,793
I have taken a vow that I will only be with one woman.

82
00:11:41,593 --> 00:11:45,549
And believe me, no other woman can deter me from this vow.

83
00:11:45,794 --> 00:11:50,914
I will have only one woman in my life and that woman is you!

84
00:11:51,508 --> 00:11:54,553
My lord, I too promise you,

85
00:11:55,034 --> 00:12:00,254
be it rain or shine, I will always be with you..

86
00:12:03,017 --> 00:12:05,687
Now will you be my Queen Sita?

87
00:12:09,718 --> 00:12:14,852
But life is never just a bed of roses.

88
00:12:15,434 --> 00:12:17,684
The good days were gone..

89
00:12:18,113 --> 00:12:24,460
..and misfortune was slowly creeping its way into the Kingdom of Ayodhya.

90
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:28,027
Here it comes! And look I win!

91
00:12:28,655 --> 00:12:29,746
You lose again.

92
00:12:33,222 --> 00:12:36,691
Huh.. enjoy my lady, laugh your hear out.

93
00:12:37,233 --> 00:12:40,074
Who knows what tomorrow will bring?

94
00:12:40,993 --> 00:12:42,079
What did you say?

95
00:12:43,808 --> 00:12:49,754
Eh..er Only if you spare my life, O'Queen.

96
00:12:50,154 --> 00:12:52,554
My Ram will be crowned tomorrow.

97
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:54,544
There is nothing to be afraid of.

98
00:12:55,194 --> 00:12:57,492
Speak.. speak without fear.

99
00:13:00,497 --> 00:13:04,393
This crowning will bring misfortune for you!

100
00:13:05,327 --> 00:13:07,088
What nonsense Manthra!

101
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:15,426
I only want the best for you O'Queen.

102
00:13:15,914 --> 00:13:20,040
You and your son Bharat are like my family!

103
00:13:21,953 --> 00:13:25,051
People in this palace are conspiring against you.

104
00:13:25,352 --> 00:13:27,728
Conspiring? What do you mean?

105
00:13:28,382 --> 00:13:30,913
Once Ram is crowned King,

106
00:13:30,993 --> 00:13:35,833
Kaushalya and Sumitra will reveal their true colours to you.

107
00:13:36,353 --> 00:13:39,684
They both are, jealous of the King's love for you..

108
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:41,380
..they are jealous of you..

109
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:48,054
No no.. My Ram will never let this happen.

110
00:13:48,459 --> 00:13:50,859
You keep singing Ram's praises and..

111
00:13:51,473 --> 00:13:54,506
..the moment he becomes King, he will only listen to his mother

112
00:13:54,587 --> 00:13:57,904
..and will throw you and Bharat out of Ayodhya.

113
00:13:59,096 --> 00:14:01,904
Even the King Dashrath won't have a say.

114
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:09,633
Do you remember the great war of Shamrasur?

115
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:11,283
Hmmm..?

116
00:14:11,713 --> 00:14:13,641
You saved the King's life..

117
00:14:13,766 --> 00:14:17,352
..and for that, he had granted you two boons.

118
00:14:19,747 --> 00:14:20,547
Hmmm..

119
00:14:20,914 --> 00:14:23,587
Which you are still holding, O'Queen.

120
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:26,593
Now is the time to ask for them.

121
00:14:26,772 --> 00:14:28,593
Now come to the point!

122
00:14:40,751 --> 00:14:43,981
Hmm.. I agree with you..

123
00:14:45,113 --> 00:14:47,213
..they dare to plot against me..

124
00:14:48,154 --> 00:14:52,074
..but why only fourteen years.. why no t death?

125
00:14:52,274 --> 00:14:53,554
No.. no my Queen!

126
00:14:54,257 --> 00:14:57,997
Ram is very popular.. there could be a rebellion.

127
00:14:58,742 --> 00:15:02,390
Fourteen years will rob him of his youth..

128
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:05,268
..he will be forgotten by then.

129
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:09,367
And there are Rakshas in the forest..

130
00:15:10,113 --> 00:15:15,271
Who knows, they might just finish him off, O'Queen..

131
00:15:25,487 --> 00:15:28,684
A stubborn Queen Kaykai, put her foot down.

132
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:32,416
She forced King Dashrath to declare..

133
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:36,988
..her own son Bharat as King, and banish Ram from the Kingdom.

134
00:15:42,021 --> 00:15:43,942
I have to honour my father's promise..

135
00:15:45,745 --> 00:15:46,867
..please let me go..

136
00:15:47,085 --> 00:15:49,986
I will see who dares to steal your birth right!

137
00:15:50,438 --> 00:15:52,427
I will kill Bharat!

138
00:15:52,733 --> 00:15:54,626
And if father comes in the way, I will..

139
00:15:54,876 --> 00:15:56,546
Stay calm Laxman.

140
00:15:57,747 --> 00:16:01,070
I don't want a tainted kingdom through immoral means.

141
00:16:01,993 --> 00:16:03,614
Prepare for my departure.

142
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:06,906
This is my order.

143
00:16:07,338 --> 00:16:09,761
I too will come with you.

144
00:16:12,865 --> 00:16:16,547
I have taken a vow, to be with you always..

145
00:16:16,804 --> 00:16:21,083
But Sita.. - If I break my vow, I will surely die.

146
00:16:45,786 --> 00:16:47,066
My son..

147
00:16:48,322 --> 00:16:49,867
..this is my bad luck..

148
00:16:50,257 --> 00:16:51,546
..my misfortune..

149
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:54,107
Forgive me my son..

150
00:16:54,402 --> 00:16:56,364
..forgive me..

151
00:16:57,179 --> 00:16:58,906
Don't say such things father..

152
00:17:00,849 --> 00:17:03,106
Fourteen years shall pass by in a blink of an eye.

153
00:17:04,447 --> 00:17:06,706
I beg you father, let me go.

154
00:17:13,193 --> 00:17:15,706
No, no! You are a warrior.

155
00:17:15,982 --> 00:17:20,883
On the strength of your sword rule Kosal my son.

156
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:24,661
Nothing like this has ever happened in our family, father..

157
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:28,440
And Ram, will never let it happen in his life.

158
00:17:30,116 --> 00:17:31,016
I'll go.

159
00:17:33,962 --> 00:17:34,962
Ram!

160
00:17:36,698 --> 00:17:38,186
Don't go Ram!..

161
00:17:38,722 --> 00:17:40,827
Ayodhya is yours.

162
00:17:41,654 --> 00:17:43,109
Disobey me son..

163
00:17:44,238 --> 00:17:47,667
Ram.. my son..

164
00:17:48,038 --> 00:17:49,467
Don't go..

165
00:17:49,739 --> 00:17:51,107
Don't go.. Ram..

166
00:17:51,427 --> 00:17:52,367
Don't go..

167
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:28,227
Ram.. Ram..

168
00:18:33,947 --> 00:18:35,807
Please let me come with you Ram..

169
00:18:36,475 --> 00:18:39,306
..who else will look after you there my brother!

170
00:19:09,386 --> 00:19:13,466
Carry on my lord, your duty is of prime importance.

171
00:19:14,527 --> 00:19:16,267
I will wait for you.

172
00:19:29,248 --> 00:19:33,707
Ram, Laxman and Sita proceeded towards Chitrakoot.

173
00:19:34,905 --> 00:19:37,507
Kevat, who was a devout follower washed their feet in reverence.

174
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:43,702
And helped them cross the river Ganges in his boat.

175
00:19:52,172 --> 00:19:54,459
Chirakoot's unmatched natural..

176
00:19:55,318 --> 00:19:57,867
..beauty helped them forget their sorrows..

177
00:20:00,091 --> 00:20:04,386
But, misfortune continued to shroud Ayodhya.

178
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:10,107
And King Dashrath who had lost the will to live died, sadly.

179
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:18,786
However, the noble Bharat refused..

180
00:20:19,063 --> 00:20:24,226
..to be part of his mother's conspiracy.

181
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:28,827
He traveled to Chitrakoot to plea with Ram to return to Ayodhya.

182
00:20:29,264 --> 00:20:32,064
The righteous Ram stood his ground.

183
00:20:32,251 --> 00:20:33,652
But so did Bharat..

184
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:39,227
..he returned to Ayodhya with Ram's slippers.

185
00:20:40,481 --> 00:20:45,833
The Kingdom of Ayodhya still remained under Ram.

186
00:20:51,296 --> 00:20:53,547
Destroying evil on the way and..

187
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:57,165
..guiding people towards virtue..

188
00:20:58,073 --> 00:21:00,877
..the three noble souls traveled together, across high mountains..

189
00:21:01,049 --> 00:21:02,762
..through deep forests for ten long years.

190
00:21:03,473 --> 00:21:06,827
Eventually they met the great sage Agastya..

191
00:21:07,254 --> 00:21:10,732
..who gifted the two brothers with divine weapons.

192
00:21:11,367 --> 00:21:12,746
The bows of Lord Vishnu..

193
00:21:12,981 --> 00:21:17,027
..and quivers that would never run short of arrows.

194
00:21:17,829 --> 00:21:20,831
Ram was now invincible.

195
00:21:21,788 --> 00:21:25,637
And then they headed to Panchvati.

196
00:21:26,369 --> 00:21:29,103
Thirteen years had passed.

197
00:21:29,803 --> 00:21:34,186
Laxman and Sita were looking for ward tore turning to Ayodhya.

198
00:21:35,465 --> 00:21:40,906
However Ram sensed that fate still had ore in store for them.

199
00:21:45,547 --> 00:21:47,707
Who's this charming young man?

200
00:21:48,809 --> 00:21:51,906
And what are you doing in this forest?

201
00:21:52,453 --> 00:21:55,186
I am Dashrath's son Ram, lady.

202
00:21:55,877 --> 00:21:56,778
And you?

203
00:21:57,253 --> 00:22:03,938
Me, I am the Queen of this forest, Shurpanakha.

204
00:22:05,975 --> 00:22:07,494
You are the Queen of this forest?

205
00:22:08,254 --> 00:22:10,666
Then please, come into my humble abode.

206
00:22:11,166 --> 00:22:14,026
No! You come with me.

207
00:22:14,646 --> 00:22:18,961
All the comforts are waiting for you.

208
00:22:19,511 --> 00:22:21,226
I cannot go with you.

209
00:22:21,955 --> 00:22:24,466
I am bound my a promise. You may go now.

210
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:29,547
My beauty is unparalleled.

211
00:22:30,317 --> 00:22:32,947
Except my proposal please..

212
00:22:33,212 --> 00:22:34,922
..you shall be the King of this forest.

213
00:22:35,001 --> 00:22:38,666
I respect women, I don't want to cause you any harm.

214
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:40,393
Please leave.

215
00:22:44,174 --> 00:22:45,946
You are a fool, Ram.

216
00:22:46,453 --> 00:22:49,986
Now I will make you my slave.

217
00:22:55,098 --> 00:22:56,049
Stop!..

218
00:22:56,176 --> 00:23:00,026
Aha.. two charming young men!

219
00:23:02,393 --> 00:23:03,666
What's wrong my Lord?

220
00:23:03,963 --> 00:23:09,626
Oh, I see, so this is why you have refused me, Ram.

221
00:23:09,948 --> 00:23:12,706
Now I will kill her first..

222
00:23:15,004 --> 00:23:15,954
LAXMAN!!!

223
00:23:16,885 --> 00:23:19,107
We don't kill women and children.

224
00:23:19,454 --> 00:23:20,355
And so..

225
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:25,267
Now, go away.

226
00:23:25,555 --> 00:23:28,387
Your powers of seduction are of no use anymore.

227
00:23:28,748 --> 00:23:32,797
Aaaahhhhh..

228
00:23:32,876 --> 00:23:35,386
Aaaahhhhh..

229
00:23:36,984 --> 00:23:39,587
I am mighty Ravan's sister, you fools!

230
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:43,546
You shall be punished.. punished for this.

231
00:24:13,459 --> 00:24:20,524
We.. are conquerors, we.. are rulers,

232
00:24:21,746 --> 00:24:24,754
we.. are Rakshas!!

233
00:24:27,447 --> 00:24:28,586
We are..

234
00:24:29,415 --> 00:24:31,307
Rakshas..

235
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:33,347
Rakshas..

236
00:24:40,047 --> 00:24:41,447
Commander, Prahast

237
00:24:44,836 --> 00:24:46,886
The Gods have revolted my Lord..

238
00:24:47,799 --> 00:24:50,502
..they have killed one of our commanders.

239
00:24:50,928 --> 00:24:52,271
Destroy them all!

240
00:24:53,398 --> 00:24:57,620
If any head is raised against Ravan (pause) cut if off!..

241
00:24:58,705 --> 00:24:59,706
crush it!

242
00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:01,415
be it a woman or a child.

243
00:25:02,203 --> 00:25:04,347
Kill them all.

244
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:09,011
- We are.. - Raskhas..

245
00:25:13,667 --> 00:25:15,035
Stay seated Vibhishan..

246
00:25:16,271 --> 00:25:19,666
I already know, what your going to say..

247
00:25:19,899 --> 00:25:22,998
But.. my Lord.. what about dharma?

248
00:25:23,078 --> 00:25:25,946
Don't you teach me about dharma, fool..

249
00:25:27,283 --> 00:25:30,746
Didn't you hear, sit down!

250
00:25:36,505 --> 00:25:38,586
Long live the great Lord of Lanka,

251
00:25:39,026 --> 00:25:40,427
Princess Shurpanakha is here..

252
00:25:40,703 --> 00:25:42,399
..she would like to see you urgently..

253
00:25:42,988 --> 00:25:43,947
Shurphanakha?

254
00:25:45,666 --> 00:25:47,186
What is she doing here?

255
00:25:48,369 --> 00:25:49,337
Send her in..

256
00:25:54,692 --> 00:25:56,186
Enough of acting, Shurphanakha!

257
00:25:57,108 --> 00:25:59,587
Get to the point what do you want?

258
00:26:27,433 --> 00:26:29,107
Court is adjourned for the day.

259
00:26:35,783 --> 00:26:37,309
What are you thinking about?..

260
00:26:39,165 --> 00:26:40,784
They have insulted your sister..

261
00:26:40,865 --> 00:26:43,685
Go, and destroy all of those women.

262
00:26:46,052 --> 00:26:48,186
Yes, Shurphanakha is stupid.

263
00:26:49,042 --> 00:26:52,186
Who knows? It could be a conspiracy of the Gods.

264
00:26:56,193 --> 00:27:00,307
But what about.. that woman.. Sita?

265
00:27:00,933 --> 00:27:04,757
Ssssshhhhhhhhaaaa.. Enough!

266
00:27:05,392 --> 00:27:08,557
All you ever think about is women..

267
00:27:10,245 --> 00:27:14,066
4It's dangerous.. very dangerous.

268
00:27:15,293 --> 00:27:17,867
I also think it is a conspiracy of the gods..

269
00:27:18,322 --> 00:27:19,706
Me too.. - Me too..

270
00:27:19,947 --> 00:27:21,929
Me too.. - Me too..

271
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:27,107
If this is a conspiracy by the Gods..

272
00:27:28,165 --> 00:27:31,706
Then I too can play the game of illusion..

273
00:27:36,777 --> 00:27:39,907
Hmm.. Sita..

274
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:52,546
Hmmm..

275
00:28:04,428 --> 00:28:05,946
What a beautiful deer!

276
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,466
It is very beautiful.

277
00:28:24,443 --> 00:28:25,587
Sita?

278
00:28:25,865 --> 00:28:29,436
Shh.. Speak softly.. it'll run away.

279
00:28:29,951 --> 00:28:32,467
Doesn't look like a conspiracy of the Gods.

280
00:28:34,409 --> 00:28:42,000
But Sita, is magnificent..

281
00:28:42,861 --> 00:28:44,146
amazingly beautiful.

282
00:28:47,807 --> 00:28:49,947
My Lord, please catch it for me..

283
00:28:50,651 --> 00:28:53,227
If it stays with me, I will be so happy.

284
00:28:54,582 --> 00:28:55,886
Please catch it for me..

285
00:28:56,370 --> 00:28:58,052
I'll take it to Ayodhya.

286
00:28:58,753 --> 00:29:00,155
Look how wonderful it is.

287
00:29:00,889 --> 00:29:02,966
It seems like its made out of gold.

288
00:29:05,036 --> 00:29:07,507
Wonder.. if it's an illusion?

289
00:29:09,856 --> 00:29:12,727
Aha.. what a beautiful deer..

290
00:29:13,548 --> 00:29:16,307
Please my Lord.. for me?

291
00:29:19,108 --> 00:29:23,307
So be it, Sita.. Laxman, I'm going after it.

292
00:29:23,573 --> 00:29:25,706
If I go far, be vigilant.

293
00:29:28,729 --> 00:29:31,427
Now the game begins..

294
00:30:26,087 --> 00:30:28,834
Laxman..

295
00:30:31,753 --> 00:30:34,593
Sita..

296
00:30:37,394 --> 00:30:39,713
This sounds like your brother's voice!..

297
00:30:39,793 --> 00:30:42,233
I think.. I think he's in trouble!

298
00:30:42,725 --> 00:30:45,793
Don't worry, it’s just not possible..

299
00:30:46,111 --> 00:30:47,184
Please, go inside.

300
00:30:47,443 --> 00:30:51,354
Laxman my brother..

301
00:30:51,736 --> 00:30:55,154
Listen.. you're brother is in trouble, he's calling you

302
00:30:55,587 --> 00:30:59,513
and you say there's no need to worry.. Go, go now!

303
00:30:59,594 --> 00:31:03,299
Not necessary.. My brother, in trouble? Impossible!

304
00:31:05,228 --> 00:31:08,025
What?.. Shame on you Laxman.

305
00:31:08,447 --> 00:31:12,069
Like mother Kaykai have you also lost your head?

306
00:31:12,588 --> 00:31:14,765
Do you also have your eye on Ayodhya, now?

307
00:31:16,272 --> 00:31:18,285
You can go alone, to Ayodhya.

308
00:31:18,713 --> 00:31:19,989
Don't say that.. please.

309
00:31:24,513 --> 00:31:27,793
Sita..

310
00:31:29,251 --> 00:31:32,539
I'll.. I'll go.. but I must ensure your safety first.

311
00:31:33,713 --> 00:31:36,452
Now this hut is secured with a magical spell.

312
00:31:36,753 --> 00:31:39,831
Promise me, whatever happens, you will not cross this line.

313
00:31:42,753 --> 00:31:44,993
Oh! Why did I wish for that deer..

314
00:31:45,486 --> 00:31:47,126
Alms, please!

315
00:31:49,555 --> 00:31:52,484
May you always be happy.. Are you alone?

316
00:31:52,914 --> 00:31:55,195
Uhh.. no O'Sage..

317
00:31:55,694 --> 00:31:58,091
My husband and his brother will be here soon.

318
00:32:00,634 --> 00:32:02,990
May I trouble you for some alms, my child?

319
00:32:03,482 --> 00:32:04,511
Certainly O'Sage..

320
00:32:15,772 --> 00:32:18,713
Please come here and accept this offering..

321
00:32:18,982 --> 00:32:20,771
I am an aesthetic my child..

322
00:32:21,513 --> 00:32:25,394
..even the shadow of a house is absolutely forbidden for me..

323
00:32:25,938 --> 00:32:29,149
you must come here to give me the alms..

324
00:32:29,594 --> 00:32:32,871
Forgive me, O'Revered one, I cannot do that.

325
00:32:33,033 --> 00:32:34,323
I cannot cross this line.

326
00:32:34,662 --> 00:32:38,274
This is an insult! A great insult!

327
00:32:39,233 --> 00:32:41,167
I'm not a beggar seeking alms..

328
00:32:41,248 --> 00:32:43,249
If you want to give it to me come here..

329
00:32:43,394 --> 00:32:44,814
or else I'll leave.

330
00:32:45,354 --> 00:32:49,953
But remember, an insult to a Sage at your doorstep,

331
00:32:50,033 --> 00:32:52,781
even the Gods will never forgive!

332
00:32:52,953 --> 00:32:54,914
I leave!!

333
00:32:54,993 --> 00:32:56,513
Please, wait, O' Sage!

334
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:07,459
Thank you my dear.

335
00:33:07,993 --> 00:33:11,073
May God make you Queen of the entire universe.

336
00:33:15,793 --> 00:33:17,434
What is this, you rogue?..

337
00:33:18,889 --> 00:33:20,402
Very beautiful.

338
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:24,049
You are really beautiful.

339
00:33:25,033 --> 00:33:28,098
Leave my hand, else you'll get killed.

340
00:33:28,303 --> 00:33:31,782
You look more beautiful when angry.

341
00:33:33,473 --> 00:33:34,522
Who are you?

342
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:36,405
How do you know my name?

343
00:33:36,677 --> 00:33:38,238
I'm Ravan!

344
00:33:38,941 --> 00:33:40,906
King of Lanka, Ravan.

345
00:33:41,137 --> 00:33:42,691
Ravan with ten heads.

346
00:33:42,988 --> 00:33:44,805
That Surpanakha's brother.

347
00:33:45,028 --> 00:33:47,165
..one, whose nose you had cut off.

348
00:33:47,562 --> 00:33:49,908
I've avenged you.

349
00:33:50,289 --> 00:33:53,469
Now you'll be my queen.

350
00:33:53,691 --> 00:33:54,756
Lord!

351
00:33:55,021 --> 00:33:56,251
Laxman!

352
00:33:56,548 --> 00:33:57,498
Help me!

353
00:33:57,687 --> 00:34:01,544
Don't feel sad. I'll give you all the respect.

354
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:04,394
You'll be my chief queen.

355
00:34:04,923 --> 00:34:06,046
C'mon.

356
00:34:06,748 --> 00:34:08,167
Be aware, Ravan.

357
00:34:08,522 --> 00:34:12,263
You've invited your death by kidnapping me.

358
00:34:12,923 --> 00:34:14,814
You'll be destroyed.

359
00:34:17,504 --> 00:34:18,727
Let's go.

360
00:34:27,097 --> 00:34:31,929
The malicious Ravan... abducted Sita and flew, south...

361
00:34:32,104 --> 00:34:37,344
But a large obstacle obstructed his path...

362
00:34:37,819 --> 00:34:39,984
the Vulture King.. Jatayu.

363
00:34:40,064 --> 00:34:41,153
O’Ram!...

364
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:45,524
Where are you?... Save me!

365
00:34:45,789 --> 00:34:48,975
When Ram and Laxman reached Panchvati..

366
00:34:49,330 --> 00:34:51,570
Sita was not there..

367
00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:56,500
they looked for her everywhere.. but she was nowhere to be found.

368
00:34:58,193 --> 00:34:59,787
Sister-in-law!

369
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,691
Sita..

370
00:35:04,865 --> 00:35:07,180
You will not be rescued my anyone Sita..

371
00:35:07,935 --> 00:35:10,099
You are now all mine

372
00:35:22,051 --> 00:35:23,436
Hold on coward!

373
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:27,314
There is nothing heroic in kidnapping a woman.

374
00:35:28,256 --> 00:35:29,370
Come and face me!

375
00:35:29,450 --> 00:35:30,850
Who are you, fool?

376
00:35:31,593 --> 00:35:33,642
Who dares to cross Ravan's path?

377
00:35:34,738 --> 00:35:36,531
Have you no fear of dying?

378
00:35:36,611 --> 00:35:39,511
I am Jatayu, The Vulture!

379
00:35:39,957 --> 00:35:41,106
Let her go..

380
00:36:18,850 --> 00:36:19,765
Sita..

381
00:36:22,495 --> 00:36:23,644
Where are you?..

382
00:36:27,131 --> 00:36:30,033
Has anyone seen my Sita?

383
00:36:31,709 --> 00:36:34,691
On the way Sita dropped some of

384
00:36:34,771 --> 00:36:37,551
her ornaments on the top of the "Rishyamukh" mountains..

385
00:36:37,912 --> 00:36:40,930
Where the Monkey Lord Sugreev, finds them.

386
00:36:41,571 --> 00:36:46,491
Searching for Sita, Ram and Laxman found the mortally wounded, Jatayu..

387
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:50,050
Moving further south..

388
00:36:50,542 --> 00:36:54,810
..they encountered a headless Raskhas - Kabandh..

389
00:36:54,890 --> 00:36:57,705
Who was actually a cursed God..

390
00:36:58,964 --> 00:37:04,371
Kabandh showed them the way to the hermitage of Sage Matang..

391
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,004
where a tribal woman, Shabari was waiting for them..

392
00:37:08,171 --> 00:37:10,029
She offered them berries..

393
00:37:11,182 --> 00:37:13,690
while tasting each and every one of them to make sure that

394
00:37:13,771 --> 00:37:15,930
they were sweet enough!

395
00:37:21,691 --> 00:37:24,955
After this.. they reached Kishkindha..

396
00:37:25,731 --> 00:37:28,290
the Kingdom of monkey - men.. Kishkindha.

397
00:38:04,644 --> 00:38:08,444
"Happiness is with us."

398
00:38:08,847 --> 00:38:12,606
"We make the existence."

399
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:16,339
"We're the kings of Jungle."

400
00:38:17,039 --> 00:38:20,797
"Fun is less."

401
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:42,481
"The world walks with us."

402
00:38:42,830 --> 00:38:46,584
"The sky stops with us."

403
00:38:46,834 --> 00:38:50,972
"We love Kiskindha more than our life."

404
00:38:51,051 --> 00:38:54,745
"Every attack of it is unique."

405
00:38:59,216 --> 00:39:03,088
"Come, monkeys, Jungle calls you."

406
00:39:03,392 --> 00:39:07,098
"Come, monkeys, Jungle calls you."

407
00:39:07,488 --> 00:39:11,361
Give a meaning to your life. Make the most of it.

408
00:39:11,551 --> 00:39:15,415
"Sing such a song that brings everyone together. "

409
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:42,033
It was Kabandh who told us about Surgreev, Hanuman..

410
00:39:43,490 --> 00:39:45,544
And you know all that followed..

411
00:39:46,211 --> 00:39:47,542
Now we are friends..

412
00:39:48,571 --> 00:39:51,754
But.. under Bali's reign of terror,

413
00:39:52,010 --> 00:39:54,050
do you think Surgreev can really help us?

414
00:39:54,370 --> 00:39:57,490
Laxman.. If we can be free of Bali..

415
00:39:57,731 --> 00:40:00,113
then Surgreev will do anything for us..

416
00:40:01,010 --> 00:40:03,213
if Lord Ram helps him..

417
00:40:03,490 --> 00:40:05,407
Surgreev will definitely win..

418
00:40:05,691 --> 00:40:07,230
What Bali did was wrong..

419
00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:10,097
No one treats his younger brother like that..

420
00:40:11,091 --> 00:40:14,542
But why are you with Surgreev, my friend?

421
00:40:14,930 --> 00:40:16,784
Surgreev loves his people,

422
00:40:17,073 --> 00:40:18,605
but Bali is a progressive thinker..

423
00:40:20,292 --> 00:40:23,289
We will only be happy under Surgreev's rule.

424
00:40:24,571 --> 00:40:25,371
Hmmm..

425
00:40:26,575 --> 00:40:28,144
Tomorrow's a big day for us..

426
00:40:28,767 --> 00:40:31,220
Tomorrow, Surgreev will challenge Bali to a duel!..

427
00:40:33,010 --> 00:40:35,450
Lets go.. Ram will be waiting us.

428
00:40:56,399 --> 00:40:58,454
Bali is very strong, Lord Ram!

429
00:40:58,810 --> 00:41:02,426
He has the power to smash mountains into mere dust..

430
00:41:02,642 --> 00:41:04,746
he uproots huge trees with his bare hands.

431
00:41:04,827 --> 00:41:06,345
How will you defeat him?

432
00:41:06,961 --> 00:41:09,946
What? are you doubting my brother's abilities?

433
00:41:10,450 --> 00:41:13,219
No.. No ! I'm just asking!

434
00:41:33,187 --> 00:41:34,551
Did you see that, my friend?..

435
00:41:35,586 --> 00:41:38,005
I'll challenge Bali right now!

436
00:41:46,292 --> 00:41:47,270
Bali!

437
00:41:49,008 --> 00:41:50,011
Bali!..

438
00:41:52,506 --> 00:41:54,636
Come out and face me!..

439
00:41:55,185 --> 00:41:56,866
You fool! Come out!!

440
00:42:36,028 --> 00:42:39,747
Careful, be gentle.. it hurts too much.. Ah!..

441
00:42:41,707 --> 00:42:43,314
If you didn't want to kill Bali,

442
00:42:43,975 --> 00:42:45,575
then why did you think of such a plan?

443
00:42:46,347 --> 00:42:47,466
To get me killed?

444
00:42:47,647 --> 00:42:49,366
What kind of a friend are you, Lord Ram?

445
00:42:49,865 --> 00:42:51,949
Try and understand my predicament, Surgreev?

446
00:42:52,455 --> 00:42:54,973
What if I had mistaken you for your brother Bali,

447
00:42:55,386 --> 00:42:56,636
and killed you instead.

448
00:42:56,810 --> 00:43:00,307
That's true! Both of you, look very similar.

449
00:43:00,495 --> 00:43:02,146
Whether it was Bali or you..

450
00:43:02,227 --> 00:43:03,946
it was difficult to distinguish.

451
00:43:04,026 --> 00:43:06,946
Let's try it once more.. Go once more..

452
00:43:07,113 --> 00:43:08,867
It's a different plan this time!

453
00:43:09,022 --> 00:43:13,988
No no, brother.. I know how great your plans are for me..

454
00:43:14,618 --> 00:43:16,050
I've experienced it already.

455
00:43:20,437 --> 00:43:22,617
We won't fail this time Surgreev.

456
00:43:23,066 --> 00:43:27,129
See, this time you're going to wear this garland!

457
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:28,638
Aaaaaahhhhhh..

458
00:43:42,386 --> 00:43:43,443
Bali..

459
00:43:45,176 --> 00:43:45,987
O'Bali..

460
00:43:53,414 --> 00:43:55,290
Fool, come out..!

461
00:45:49,595 --> 00:45:53,253
"Om.."

462
00:46:22,227 --> 00:46:24,392
For Lord Surgreev!

463
00:46:24,705 --> 00:46:25,886
Hail..

464
00:46:26,390 --> 00:46:28,253
Hail Bali's son Angad!

465
00:46:28,611 --> 00:46:33,278
Hail.. Hail.. Hail.. Hail..

466
00:46:33,508 --> 00:46:38,117
Hail.. Hail.. Hail..

467
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:41,089
Friends..

468
00:46:42,617 --> 00:46:44,640
Life gifts only one chance..

469
00:46:45,573 --> 00:46:49,636
we have to prove our mettle in this lifetime..

470
00:46:49,934 --> 00:46:51,321
Bali was my brother..

471
00:46:52,261 --> 00:46:55,513
but nothing is above the values and morals of life..

472
00:46:57,149 --> 00:47:00,073
I am the Monkey - Lord, Surgreev..

473
00:47:01,377 --> 00:47:04,107
will all of you stand by me?

474
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:06,403
Yes.. Yes!!

475
00:47:42,455 --> 00:47:44,046
So Bali's was killed..

476
00:47:44,722 --> 00:47:46,650
And one more important thing, my Lord.

477
00:47:47,615 --> 00:47:51,073
A large army of monkey men, have gathered in Kishkindha.

478
00:47:51,716 --> 00:47:53,267
How does that matter?

479
00:47:53,906 --> 00:47:55,616
Surgreev is King now..

480
00:47:56,151 --> 00:47:58,222
he must be showing off his new strength.

481
00:47:59,216 --> 00:48:00,696
Squad Commander Sushen,

482
00:48:00,868 --> 00:48:03,859
you along with your troops will proceed towards the east..

483
00:48:05,816 --> 00:48:08,140
General Taar, you will go westwards..

484
00:48:08,979 --> 00:48:11,484
Kesri, you will go to the north..

485
00:48:12,002 --> 00:48:14,294
I will give you all just one month’s time..

486
00:48:14,935 --> 00:48:17,242
You must return without fail within a month..

487
00:48:17,736 --> 00:48:20,660
with valid proof.. whether Mother Sita..

488
00:48:20,921 --> 00:48:23,010
..is in that direction.. or not

489
00:48:24,254 --> 00:48:28,345
Hanuman, Angad, Jaamvant and Nal-Neel,

490
00:48:29,332 --> 00:48:31,437
you are my greatest warriors.

491
00:48:32,376 --> 00:48:35,352
The chances of locating Sita are brightest towards the south.

492
00:48:36,376 --> 00:48:39,930
So, with Angad as your leader you will head south.

493
00:48:40,535 --> 00:48:43,336
But remember, only one month.

494
00:48:43,615 --> 00:48:48,095
We assure you, my Lord.. if we fail.. we will not return alive.

495
00:48:48,269 --> 00:48:51,819
But.. if we find mother Sita,.. how will she recognise us?

496
00:48:53,769 --> 00:48:57,415
If you find Sita.. show her this ring..

497
00:48:59,307 --> 00:49:00,942
She will accept you as her friend..

498
00:49:18,015 --> 00:49:22,095
Please eat, my dear.. going hungry is not the solution..

499
00:49:22,276 --> 00:49:23,476
How can I eat?

500
00:49:24,216 --> 00:49:27,232
When I know that, my Ram must be hungry.

501
00:49:33,338 --> 00:49:35,856
Ram.. it’s been three months..

502
00:49:35,935 --> 00:49:37,979
the southern group has still not returned!

503
00:49:42,060 --> 00:49:43,737
I have still not given up hope Laxman..

504
00:49:45,696 --> 00:49:49,495
If they are late, that means that hope is still.. alive.

505
00:50:16,055 --> 00:50:19,727
I'm getting old now..

506
00:50:24,609 --> 00:50:25,774
Hold on, my Lord..

507
00:50:26,935 --> 00:50:30,415
You are a vulture.. I'm sure you know of the Vulture King, Jatayu..

508
00:50:31,265 --> 00:50:34,558
Jatayu?.. He's my younger brother..

509
00:50:36,410 --> 00:50:37,633
How do you know him?

510
00:50:47,252 --> 00:50:48,689
My dear brother, Jatayu..

511
00:50:49,935 --> 00:50:54,260
This Ravan who has slain you.. will pay for this!

512
00:50:54,986 --> 00:50:56,321
He'll be slaughtered..

513
00:50:57,216 --> 00:51:00,539
Listen, friends! I have seen Ravan,

514
00:51:01,055 --> 00:51:04,496
flying to Lanka with a helpless woman..

515
00:51:04,825 --> 00:51:06,392
That must be mother Sita.

516
00:51:06,656 --> 00:51:07,456
Lanka?

517
00:51:08,256 --> 00:51:12,001
Yes, Lanka.. that is his kingdom..

518
00:51:12,925 --> 00:51:15,205
it is an island in the middle of this vast ocean.

519
00:51:16,455 --> 00:51:19,736
But how will we reach there, Lord Sampati?

520
00:51:19,816 --> 00:51:22,243
Not far from here from the edge of Mt. Mahendra,

521
00:51:22,676 --> 00:51:25,325
Lanka is a just a 100 miles away..

522
00:51:26,095 --> 00:51:27,735
The ocean is shallow there..

523
00:51:28,390 --> 00:51:30,794
as the Mainak range of mountains lie beneath..

524
00:51:31,276 --> 00:51:33,271
that's the shortest way to Lanka.

525
00:51:34,656 --> 00:51:35,910
We thank you my Lord..

526
00:51:36,785 --> 00:51:38,107
we are really grateful.

527
00:51:42,352 --> 00:51:46,278
Lanka is 100 miles from here.

528
00:51:46,539 --> 00:51:49,147
I leap 60 miles, without a break.

529
00:51:50,615 --> 00:51:54,936
I'm old but I still can go 80 miles.

530
00:51:55,463 --> 00:51:57,499
I can jump a 100 miles,

531
00:51:58,615 --> 00:52:03,179
but getting back could be difficult..

532
00:52:05,296 --> 00:52:06,597
So, what should we do now?

533
00:52:12,455 --> 00:52:13,526
I shall go..

534
00:52:14,376 --> 00:52:15,606
Wait prince..

535
00:52:16,347 --> 00:52:17,800
You are our leader..

536
00:52:18,696 --> 00:52:20,722
I know who's the right one to go..

537
00:52:21,336 --> 00:52:23,725
but he needs to be inspired first.

538
00:52:26,111 --> 00:52:27,597
Powerful young Hanuman!..

539
00:52:30,443 --> 00:52:31,732
Why so quiet?

540
00:52:36,415 --> 00:52:39,256
it's time Hanuman, to rise up..

541
00:52:40,935 --> 00:52:43,180
Rise, Hanuman!.. Rise,

542
00:52:43,805 --> 00:52:47,852
and show the world your power!

543
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:54,412
Lord Rise O'Great one.. Wake up.. Ram has is relying on you, wake up!

544
00:53:07,575 --> 00:53:09,842
Friends, do not worry..

545
00:53:10,109 --> 00:53:13,214
I shall fulfill Lord Ram's wishes..

546
00:53:57,856 --> 00:54:01,468
This is the Sea Kingdom of Sursa..

547
00:54:02,097 --> 00:54:04,347
who dares to trespass?

548
00:54:04,664 --> 00:54:07,050
You will have to, enter my mouth!

549
00:54:37,593 --> 00:54:40,636
O'serpent Mother, I have been inside your mouth.

550
00:54:41,535 --> 00:54:43,415
Your wish has been fulfilled.

551
00:54:44,415 --> 00:54:45,684
Now, let me leave please.

552
00:54:45,899 --> 00:54:49,031
Go, my blessings are with you.

553
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:48,198
Hmm.. so, this is Ravan's golden Lanka!

554
00:55:49,553 --> 00:55:50,760
This should be fun..

555
00:56:59,479 --> 00:57:02,879
Wow.. who would have thought that Hanuman was so talent.

556
00:57:02,959 --> 00:57:05,892
I have known him since he was a little child..

557
00:57:05,972 --> 00:57:07,319
..he was so playful..

558
00:57:07,470 --> 00:57:10,559
once he tried to swallow the sun thinking it was a fruit..

559
00:57:10,714 --> 00:57:15,800
but as fate would have it, he was cursed that

560
00:57:15,999 --> 00:57:21,559
unless someone inspires him, his powers would remain passive..

561
00:57:22,175 --> 00:57:25,193
So today I inspired him!

562
00:57:30,102 --> 00:57:31,599
Where could mother Sita be?..

563
00:57:31,919 --> 00:57:32,639
Where?

564
00:57:50,028 --> 00:57:51,278
Where is she?..

565
00:57:53,622 --> 00:57:54,620
What's this?

566
00:57:58,120 --> 00:58:01,769
Why don't you accept my proposal, my dearest Sita?

567
00:58:03,479 --> 00:58:08,407
Why are you wasting your life on that worthless Ram..

568
00:58:09,220 --> 00:58:11,200
I will keep you very happy..

569
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:13,861
Say yes, my beloved.. Say yes..

570
00:58:18,022 --> 00:58:21,280
You disgusting man! How many times must I say NO!

571
00:58:21,888 --> 00:58:23,803
Go! Count your days..

572
00:58:24,678 --> 00:58:27,267
My Ram will be here soon.

573
00:58:30,468 --> 00:58:32,480
You.. start counting your days..

574
00:58:32,977 --> 00:58:35,639
I had given you one years time to make up your mind..

575
00:58:35,888 --> 00:58:39,588
and now only 2 months remain,

576
00:58:40,111 --> 00:58:41,711
if you still don't agree,

577
00:58:42,896 --> 00:58:48,160
then be ready to face the consequences Ravan leaves.

578
00:58:56,077 --> 00:58:56,827
Ram..

579
00:58:58,376 --> 00:58:59,276
my Ram..

580
00:59:00,350 --> 00:59:01,697
where are you, my love?

581
00:59:02,787 --> 00:59:04,609
Should I just give up on life?

582
00:59:47,963 --> 00:59:49,276
Greetings Mother Sita..

583
00:59:49,763 --> 00:59:53,458
This.. this ring belongs to my Ram.

584
00:59:54,519 --> 00:59:57,679
Yes Mother.. my Lord Ram himself, gave it to me..

585
00:59:58,881 --> 01:00:01,377
I am his faithful.. disciple Hanuman.

586
01:00:02,357 --> 01:00:03,691
How is my beloved, Ram?

587
01:00:04,461 --> 01:00:06,185
and dear Laxman?

588
01:00:06,819 --> 01:00:09,100
How are they coping without me.

589
01:00:10,129 --> 01:00:12,513
Who's there to take care of them now?

590
01:00:13,053 --> 01:00:17,549
Mother.. after hearing about your wellbeing.. they will be relieved.

591
01:00:17,935 --> 01:00:24,141
Hanuman.. your news of my Lord, has filled my heart with great joy..

592
01:00:25,781 --> 01:00:30,541
after my Ram and Laxman, I will cherish you the most, always..

593
01:00:30,861 --> 01:00:33,501
Please tell Ram, that he must come soon..

594
01:00:34,060 --> 01:00:37,220
because after two months Ravan will kill me.

595
01:00:37,781 --> 01:00:42,661
If this is true.. then I will fly you out of here, on my shoulders.

596
01:01:04,461 --> 01:01:07,341
No, you must go.. and return soon with Lord Ram..

597
01:01:07,540 --> 01:01:09,309
Why don't you come with me, mother..

598
01:01:10,234 --> 01:01:11,976
Am I not like your son?

599
01:01:12,256 --> 01:01:12,956
No..

600
01:01:14,022 --> 01:01:15,279
for the sake of my honour..

601
01:01:15,861 --> 01:01:17,857
Ram has to come himself.

602
01:01:18,135 --> 01:01:21,421
But..? - And evil Ravan has to meet his fate..

603
01:01:26,461 --> 01:01:30,749
Take this.. take my bangle.. give this to Ram..

604
01:01:31,381 --> 01:01:32,629
he will understand.

605
01:01:33,941 --> 01:01:35,129
As you say, mother..

606
01:01:41,620 --> 01:01:44,273
Mother, I'm really hungry..

607
01:01:44,877 --> 01:01:47,885
may I eat some fruits from this garden?

608
01:01:50,220 --> 01:01:51,014
Go ahead..

609
01:02:02,926 --> 01:02:05,853
My lord, a monkey-man has barged into the garden,

610
01:02:06,220 --> 01:02:07,760
he has created quite a mess there.

611
01:02:08,021 --> 01:02:12,385
Go.. bring that damn monkey back to me.. alive!

612
01:02:13,620 --> 01:02:16,584
Who are you? And why have you come to Lanka?

613
01:02:17,084 --> 01:02:20,900
I am Kishkindha's King Surgreev's emissary, Hanuman.

614
01:02:21,100 --> 01:02:25,501
I am here to convey a message, from King Dhashrath's son, Shri Ram.

615
01:02:26,048 --> 01:02:31,789
You have abducted his wife Sita, and forcibly kept her in Lanka.

616
01:02:32,421 --> 01:02:36,502
I appeal to you, release Mother Sita and return her to Ram

617
01:02:36,861 --> 01:02:40,701
or else you will have to face the consequences of war and destruction.

618
01:02:40,861 --> 01:02:42,429
How dare you?

619
01:02:43,783 --> 01:02:45,130
You threaten Ravan!

620
01:02:45,789 --> 01:02:49,107
You dare to challenge Ravan.. The King of Lanka..

621
01:02:50,213 --> 01:02:51,113
Prahast!

622
01:02:52,236 --> 01:02:54,602
Kill this utterly worthless monkey.

623
01:02:55,510 --> 01:02:58,259
O'King, you should not kill a messenger,

624
01:02:58,461 --> 01:03:01,327
there must be some other punishment for his crime.

625
01:03:01,796 --> 01:03:05,140
Killing him would be unethical.

626
01:03:05,941 --> 01:03:06,691
Hmm..

627
01:03:08,126 --> 01:03:12,146
A monkey loves his tail more than anything else..

628
01:03:13,519 --> 01:03:17,941
set fire to his tail and drag him all over town

629
01:03:20,140 --> 01:03:21,358
It will be entertaining..

630
01:04:26,861 --> 01:04:28,100
What happened, Hanuman?

631
01:04:28,180 --> 01:04:29,501
I found Mother Sita..

632
01:04:31,140 --> 01:04:32,501
..and set fire to Lanka.

633
01:04:39,461 --> 01:04:40,560
Her bangle..

634
01:04:42,071 --> 01:04:42,897
Laxman..

635
01:04:43,863 --> 01:04:45,319
this is Sita's bangle..

636
01:04:46,401 --> 01:04:47,620
How is my Sita?

637
01:04:47,756 --> 01:04:49,141
Mother Sita is unhurt..

638
01:04:49,725 --> 01:04:52,453
And everyday she looks forward to seeing you..

639
01:04:53,540 --> 01:04:55,734
My lord, must not waste any time..

640
01:04:56,133 --> 01:05:00,100
Because, Ravan has threatened to kill her in 2 months time.

641
01:05:06,540 --> 01:05:07,490
Friends..

642
01:05:08,827 --> 01:05:12,271
I'm grateful that you all have gathered here for me..

643
01:05:13,778 --> 01:05:15,861
But, let me make this clear that, in supporting me,

644
01:05:15,941 --> 01:05:18,801
you are inviting danger for yourselves..

645
01:05:19,602 --> 01:05:22,100
I am fighting for my honour..

646
01:05:22,312 --> 01:05:23,662
but you are not bound by it..

647
01:05:25,553 --> 01:05:28,421
Rescuing Sita will mean facing the monstrous,

648
01:05:28,501 --> 01:05:32,158
Rakshas King Ravan and his ferocious army..

649
01:05:33,660 --> 01:05:36,550
Those who do not wish to fight, you are free to leave..

650
01:05:37,030 --> 01:05:41,899
but I, Ram son of King Dashrath assure you..

651
01:05:42,593 --> 01:05:44,789
that victory will be ours..

652
01:05:45,740 --> 01:05:50,380
and that, all the Raskshas will be eliminated from this earth.

653
01:05:50,551 --> 01:05:55,981
Long live Ram.. Long Live Ram..

654
01:05:58,501 --> 01:06:00,999
Now, nothing can deter me from this path..

655
01:06:01,807 --> 01:06:03,941
the Sea Lord himself will show me the way.

656
01:06:10,060 --> 01:06:14,220
Oh sea lord.. You are too proud of your vastness!

657
01:06:17,742 --> 01:06:19,191
You refuse me, the right of way?

658
01:06:21,060 --> 01:06:23,048
I will evaporate your ego..

659
01:06:23,636 --> 01:06:25,252
I will turn you into a desert..

660
01:06:50,301 --> 01:06:55,368
'Jai Ram'

661
01:06:59,999 --> 01:07:04,251
"Hail Ram's troop."

662
01:07:04,627 --> 01:07:06,749
"Give your best."

663
01:07:08,348 --> 01:07:11,245
"Hail Ram's troop."

664
01:07:13,216 --> 01:07:15,714
"Give your best."

665
01:07:22,740 --> 01:07:28,345
Vibhishan, you chose to leave your brother and to help our sworn enemy..

666
01:07:28,941 --> 01:07:33,794
I Rakshas King, Ravan banish you from Lanka forever.

667
01:07:34,203 --> 01:07:35,818
Go away traitor..

668
01:07:35,955 --> 01:07:38,296
Otherwise, you'll get killed.

669
01:07:44,714 --> 01:07:48,823
"Until Rama is with us, Victory is ours."

670
01:07:49,167 --> 01:07:53,109
"No one could defeat us. We rule the ocean."

671
01:07:53,580 --> 01:07:56,548
"When Ram and Lakhan.."

672
01:07:57,890 --> 01:08:00,169
"..two brothers are there."

673
01:08:01,830 --> 01:08:04,260
"Hail Ram's troop."

674
01:08:06,731 --> 01:08:09,120
"Give your best."

675
01:08:20,388 --> 01:08:25,348
Prahast.. call an emergency meeting, of all my commanders, immediately!

676
01:08:26,029 --> 01:08:29,242
Recall the armies from wherever they are deployed..

677
01:08:29,540 --> 01:08:32,189
Our (Rakshas) pride is being challenged.

678
01:08:33,727 --> 01:08:36,413
Almighty.. please protect my husband.

679
01:08:58,309 --> 01:09:01,229
The strongest in Ravan's army is Meghnaad.

680
01:09:02,989 --> 01:09:04,662
Kumbhkarn is asleep, most of the time..

681
01:09:04,949 --> 01:09:07,029
But he's also very dangerous.

682
01:09:08,628 --> 01:09:11,988
His other son, Prahast is the commander of his army..

683
01:09:12,239 --> 01:09:14,734
He has become famous due to Manidhdra.

684
01:09:15,145 --> 01:09:18,275
Ravan has warriors, one greater than the other, Lord Ram.

685
01:09:19,909 --> 01:09:22,265
He doesn't have moral strength, Vibhishan..

686
01:09:23,574 --> 01:09:25,934
His duplicity and sins will destroy him.

687
01:09:27,836 --> 01:09:30,588
I have come, with a message on behalf of Lord Ram.

688
01:09:30,668 --> 01:09:34,148
There is still time.. return Mother Sita.

689
01:09:34,878 --> 01:09:37,064
Your father was a dear friend, Angad.

690
01:09:37,775 --> 01:09:43,189
Join forces with me, and you will become the King of Kishkindha.

691
01:09:46,109 --> 01:09:49,468
I am more concerned about my people O'Rakshas Lord.

692
01:09:49,668 --> 01:09:52,788
Don't waste my time. Return mother Sita.

693
01:09:53,471 --> 01:09:56,789
Then go and tell your Ram..

694
01:09:57,109 --> 01:10:00,269
that in front of Ravan, he is still a child..

695
01:10:02,149 --> 01:10:07,749
He gathers a few scruffy creatures from the jungles..

696
01:10:11,636 --> 01:10:14,189
..and wants to defy me..

697
01:10:14,668 --> 01:10:18,019
Huh.. if you are so proud of your strength Ravan

698
01:10:18,868 --> 01:10:23,989
I challenge anyone here, to lift my foot.. who dares.

699
01:10:38,909 --> 01:10:39,785
Wait..

700
01:11:02,490 --> 01:11:04,345
It's pointless touching my feet, Ravan.

701
01:11:05,381 --> 01:11:09,628
Go and touch Lord Ram's, only he can save you..

702
01:11:09,708 --> 01:11:11,244
Long live Ram..

703
01:11:13,069 --> 01:11:14,379
Long live Ram..

704
01:11:20,263 --> 01:11:23,645
My Lord, that arrogant Ravan, insists on war.

705
01:11:48,342 --> 01:11:53,890
A beggar, with a rag tag army of silly animals,

706
01:11:54,342 --> 01:11:56,906
dares to challenge the mighty Ravan!

707
01:11:58,267 --> 01:12:01,021
I will teach him such a lesson, such a lesson,

708
01:12:01,101 --> 01:12:04,021
that no one..

709
01:12:04,221 --> 01:12:06,221
no one will ever threaten or..

710
01:12:06,302 --> 01:12:09,222
..invade our glorious Island of Lanka ever again.

711
01:12:09,423 --> 01:12:10,542
We are..

712
01:12:10,622 --> 01:12:11,954
Rakshas!!

713
01:14:10,806 --> 01:14:13,486
Lord Ram, this is Prahast's force..

714
01:14:14,269 --> 01:14:16,285
it is one third of Ravan's army..

715
01:14:16,365 --> 01:14:17,485
if we defeat them..

716
01:14:17,627 --> 01:14:19,763
we would significantly damage Ravan's power.

717
01:15:50,495 --> 01:15:53,972
My Lord, Ram is mightier than expected.

718
01:15:54,662 --> 01:15:59,096
And then these monkeys.. why don't you return Sita to him

719
01:16:10,290 --> 01:16:13,271
This wealth, this prosperity,

720
01:16:15,026 --> 01:16:17,490
this golden Lanka that you live in, my queen..

721
01:16:18,861 --> 01:16:20,828
All this, belongs to me.

722
01:16:22,540 --> 01:16:24,989
I earned it all myself through my might and..

723
01:16:27,681 --> 01:16:28,415
Sita..

724
01:16:30,136 --> 01:16:34,816
Sita is now a matter of self respect.

725
01:16:36,061 --> 01:16:42,150
And Ravan will never let his self respect be compromised..

726
01:16:43,096 --> 01:16:44,408
Understand, Mandodari..

727
01:16:45,194 --> 01:16:46,377
Not for anyone.

728
01:16:47,980 --> 01:16:50,736
What is it my friend? Anything important?

729
01:16:51,342 --> 01:16:54,815
My Lord, my men have informed me that tomorrow Ravan intends

730
01:16:55,664 --> 01:16:57,542
to send Kumbhkaran into battle with us.

731
01:17:41,507 --> 01:17:44,628
I want Ram's blood.

732
01:17:44,873 --> 01:17:46,156
Where is Ram?

733
01:18:04,498 --> 01:18:05,573
Ram!

734
01:18:48,553 --> 01:18:52,132
No.. No.. this is not possible..

735
01:18:52,553 --> 01:18:55,443
you can't leave me and go away like this my dear Laxman..

736
01:18:56,690 --> 01:18:59,674
How will I ever face mother Sumitra?

737
01:19:00,074 --> 01:19:01,728
I can feel a faint pulse..

738
01:19:02,354 --> 01:19:03,784
there may still be hope..

739
01:19:05,354 --> 01:19:09,194
He need are plant called Sanjivani that grows only on the Himalyas..

740
01:19:09,348 --> 01:19:12,105
But we don't have much time left.

741
01:19:12,434 --> 01:19:14,114
So, who will go.. Hanuman?

742
01:19:14,374 --> 01:19:15,354
I will go..

743
01:19:35,941 --> 01:19:37,223
Lord Sushen..

744
01:19:38,351 --> 01:19:40,593
where would I, find such a small herb?

745
01:19:40,673 --> 01:19:42,570
So I brought the whole mountain to you..

746
01:19:43,280 --> 01:19:45,374
Bless you Hanuman.. Bless you..

747
01:20:08,394 --> 01:20:09,293
Laxman..

748
01:20:13,415 --> 01:20:16,998
Now I will go.. and this time I will kill Hanuman first.

749
01:20:18,314 --> 01:20:19,381
Wait my son!

750
01:20:21,342 --> 01:20:24,562
This enemy is dangerous,

751
01:20:25,198 --> 01:20:29,673
we must be far more clever and tactful.

752
01:20:40,707 --> 01:20:43,052
You all are fighting for this, right?

753
01:20:59,263 --> 01:21:02,203
No!!!

754
01:21:03,534 --> 01:21:05,217
It is impossible!

755
01:21:05,846 --> 01:21:08,138
It must be Ravan's illusionary magic.

756
01:21:08,736 --> 01:21:10,131
I'll find out now.

757
01:21:14,074 --> 01:21:18,714
I have given you one year to make up your mind, my love.

758
01:21:18,994 --> 01:21:22,578
Now, only four days remain.

759
01:21:22,970 --> 01:21:25,175
I just came to remind you once again.

760
01:21:28,312 --> 01:21:30,559
Oh yes, take here.

761
01:21:31,501 --> 01:21:32,557
Take it.

762
01:21:33,149 --> 01:21:34,816
Your ram.

763
01:21:36,848 --> 01:21:40,776
Now I'll come after four days.

764
01:21:48,280 --> 01:21:50,200
I still don't have any information..

765
01:21:51,413 --> 01:21:53,460
My spy has not been able to find out anything yet.

766
01:21:54,280 --> 01:21:56,271
This means, that Sita may still be alive!

767
01:21:56,464 --> 01:21:58,480
And yes.. one more thing..

768
01:21:58,943 --> 01:22:01,761
Meghnad is performing a black magic ritual..

769
01:22:02,196 --> 01:22:03,141
What Ritual?

770
01:22:03,561 --> 01:22:05,281
If he succeeds in completing it,

771
01:22:05,360 --> 01:22:11,952
he will become invincible and no one will be able to defeat him.

772
01:22:12,641 --> 01:22:15,801
I know where Meghnad is performing this ritual..

773
01:22:16,024 --> 01:22:23,961
Omm.. Nikumbhalaay fat swaha..

774
01:22:24,040 --> 01:22:31,520
Omm.. Nikumbhalaay fat swaha..

775
01:22:45,150 --> 01:22:48,702
Mother, I want to give up my life.

776
01:22:53,561 --> 01:22:56,327
My child.. your husband is alive..

777
01:22:56,801 --> 01:23:00,040
I'm sure this is one Ravan's dirty tricks..

778
01:23:00,360 --> 01:23:04,409
I will find out.. I'm in touch with Vibhishan's men.

779
01:23:25,801 --> 01:23:27,757
Meghnad!!

780
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:34,599
My Lord, Ram now knows that Sita is alive..

781
01:23:35,601 --> 01:23:37,156
Vibhishan has revealed the secret.

782
01:23:41,160 --> 01:23:46,841
Ravan.. losing control like this is not in your nature at all..

783
01:23:47,891 --> 01:23:50,350
You've won over the nine planets.

784
01:23:51,102 --> 01:23:52,856
You are a mighty warrior.

785
01:23:53,632 --> 01:23:55,388
You are the greatest warrior..

786
01:23:55,798 --> 01:23:57,378
You've won all the three worlds.

787
01:23:57,458 --> 01:24:01,877
You are Ravan.. You are Ravan.. the great Ravan!

788
01:24:05,310 --> 01:24:08,021
I can never ever be defeated,

789
01:24:09,682 --> 01:24:14,021
I am Ravan, Ravan,

790
01:24:14,462 --> 01:24:17,800
Rakshas King Ravan.. Ravan.

791
01:25:08,293 --> 01:25:13,201
Stupid monkeys.. I will crush you like mosquitoes.

792
01:27:18,926 --> 01:27:22,064
No one can take my life ever!

793
01:27:22,263 --> 01:27:24,220
He is indestructible Lord Ram.

794
01:27:24,421 --> 01:27:26,904
I am immortal..

795
01:27:27,204 --> 01:27:28,880
the nectar of immortality lies in his navel.

796
01:27:29,055 --> 01:27:33,278
Ram.. your death by my hands is certain..

797
01:27:39,675 --> 01:27:41,141
On all fours sides Hanuman..

798
01:27:42,570 --> 01:27:43,604
Cowards..

799
01:28:03,485 --> 01:28:09,088
Hail Lord Ram!

800
01:28:10,079 --> 01:28:16,223
Hail Lord Ram!

801
01:28:16,650 --> 01:28:22,775
Hail Lord Ram!

802
01:29:16,669 --> 01:29:19,770
Hail Lord Ram!

803
01:29:19,851 --> 01:29:23,272
Hail Ram!

804
01:29:23,351 --> 01:29:26,206
Hail, Ram.

805
01:29:28,732 --> 01:29:30,432
Finally, Ravan is dead..

806
01:29:30,830 --> 01:29:33,355
All the Rakshas have run away..

807
01:29:33,806 --> 01:29:35,400
Ram has won..

808
01:29:36,468 --> 01:29:38,614
He'll be here any moment now..

809
01:29:40,939 --> 01:29:42,635
How will I face him..

810
01:29:43,315 --> 01:29:45,406
It’s been a year since I saw him..

811
01:29:48,718 --> 01:29:52,203
I don't know why I'm, blushing, like a new bride.

812
01:29:55,466 --> 01:29:59,066
Sita.. open your eyes, Sita..

813
01:29:59,793 --> 01:30:02,449
I'm here.. Your Ram.

814
01:30:03,064 --> 01:30:04,472
Is this a dream?

815
01:30:05,787 --> 01:30:09,945
No, no.. if I open my eyes, it may disappear.

816
01:30:10,100 --> 01:30:11,895
This is not a dream Sita..

817
01:30:12,570 --> 01:30:14,592
We have won..

818
01:30:17,457 --> 01:30:19,332
Please forgive me..

819
01:30:20,999 --> 01:30:22,917
I was not able to protect you.

820
01:30:23,105 --> 01:30:26,361
Don't say that, Laxman.. It was destiny..

821
01:30:27,110 --> 01:30:30,928
don't blame yourself.. Come now, let’s go home now..

822
01:30:31,836 --> 01:30:36,329
Fourteen years have passed.. Ayodhya will be waiting for us.

823
01:30:36,904 --> 01:30:38,785
For Mother Sita..

824
01:30:38,999 --> 01:30:40,360
Victory..

825
01:30:40,440 --> 01:30:42,257
For Lord Ram..

826
01:30:42,337 --> 01:30:45,061
Victory..

827
01:30:45,262 --> 01:30:47,456
Hail Ram!

828
01:30:51,999 --> 01:30:53,659
Hail Ram!

829
01:30:54,253 --> 01:30:56,294
Hail Ram!

830
01:30:58,293 --> 01:30:59,747
Hail Ram!

831
01:31:20,484 --> 01:31:21,441
Sister..

832
01:31:28,419 --> 01:31:30,582
Be the greatest King, my son.
