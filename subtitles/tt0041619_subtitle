00:02:14,447 --> 00:02:20,247
<i>30 years back,</i>
<i>on a stormy and rainy night</i>

2
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:42,930
<i>close to Allahabad, 2 miles away</i>
<i>from the railway station</i>

3
00:02:43,672 --> 00:02:49,200
<i>on the banks of Jamuna,</i>
<i>there is a bungalow called Sangam Bhavan</i>

4
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:52,747
<i>and is lying desolate</i>
<i>and vacant since ages.</i>

5
00:02:56,197 --> 00:03:04,157
<i>It is said that on the nights</i>
<i>of torrentia rainfall</i>

6
00:03:04,477 --> 00:03:08,961
<i>a boat appears from somewhere,</i>
<i>stops near this bungalow</i>

7
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:12,509
<i>which is situated</i>
<i>on the banks of river Jamuna.</i>

8
00:03:13,175 --> 00:03:17,303
<i>And then someone is heard</i>
<i>crying in the bungalow.</i>

9
00:03:21,247 --> 00:03:27,119
<i>People are scared of this place</i>
<i>and consider it inauspicious.</i>

10
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:35,961
<i>But in the quarters of</i>
<i>this desolate bungalow,</i>

11
00:03:36,138 --> 00:03:38,534
<i>an old gardener</i>
<i>still lives there</i>

12
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:43,197
<i>But a strange story narrated</i>
<i>by this old gardener</i>

13
00:03:44,209 --> 00:03:46,950
<i>is very famous about</i>
<i>this mansion</i>

14
00:03:47,411 --> 00:03:51,195
<i>that a very painful love story</i>
<i>had transpired here.</i>

15
00:03:53,673 --> 00:03:59,130
Yes sir, a very woeful love story
took place here.

16
00:04:00,144 --> 00:04:04,343
A 40-45 year old man

17
00:04:06,128 --> 00:04:08,798
would come here through the sea road
to build this mansion

18
00:04:08,981 --> 00:04:12,979
and would return back
the break of dawn.

19
00:04:14,826 --> 00:04:20,283
When the mansion was ready,
a beautiful woman came with him

20
00:04:20,671 --> 00:04:22,023
and started living here.

21
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:29,392
All day, she would anxiously wait
for the nightfall

22
00:04:30,483 --> 00:04:36,698
and she would sit at the river bank
waiting for her beloved.

23
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:45,055
Be it a storm or hurricane,
that man would come here at midnight.

24
00:04:46,069 --> 00:04:50,897
And would leave
at the break of dawn.

25
00:04:51,358 --> 00:04:55,142
One night, it was raining
very heavily

26
00:04:55,671 --> 00:04:59,254
there was a storm
in the river Jamuna

27
00:05:01,656 --> 00:05:07,813
the boat of love was rowing
towards it's destination

28
00:05:08,893 --> 00:05:13,377
when it got caught
in a whirpool and drowned

29
00:05:14,112 --> 00:05:18,738
but while drowning,
the last message that was heard was

30
00:05:19,121 --> 00:05:21,173
"Kamini,
don't get disheartened."

31
00:05:23,366 --> 00:05:29,581
"Don't let our love fail
with this blow of fate."

32
00:05:29,768 --> 00:05:33,351
"Our love has not failed
and never will."

33
00:05:33,803 --> 00:05:36,473
"I will come back again".

34
00:05:37,283 --> 00:05:40,794
With this assurance,
Kamini started searching

35
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:44,135
for her peace and love
in the waves of the river

36
00:05:44,311 --> 00:05:47,265
and finally one night,
she got caught

37
00:05:47,442 --> 00:05:50,039
in the whirpool
and drowned herself.

38
00:05:52,661 --> 00:05:58,117
And this beautiful mansion
of their love became desolate.

39
00:05:58,923 --> 00:06:02,434
After 40 years,
you are the first man

40
00:06:02,611 --> 00:06:05,007
who has come
to live here again.

41
00:06:06,368 --> 00:06:08,906
-That's it?
-Yes, that's it.

42
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:11,272
The story is over.

43
00:06:15,066 --> 00:06:17,533
No, it's not over.

44
00:06:17,989 --> 00:06:19,686
It was left incomplete.

45
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:23,447
You didn't tell me
who was that couple.

46
00:06:24,947 --> 00:06:27,485
Who they were and
where they came from

47
00:06:28,287 --> 00:06:30,469
is not known,
they died with that secret.

48
00:06:31,697 --> 00:06:37,912
After their death,
nobody came here asking for them.

49
00:06:38,516 --> 00:06:39,654
Since when
have you been here?

50
00:06:40,673 --> 00:06:42,370
I have been here right
from the beginning.

51
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:46,124
The garden in this mansion
has been grown by me.

52
00:06:46,936 --> 00:06:51,977
You bought this mansion,
you should know their whereabouts.

53
00:06:53,058 --> 00:06:56,214
No, I don't know,
I bought it in an auction.

54
00:06:57,373 --> 00:07:01,371
And in the documents
the owners name is blank.

55
00:07:01,687 --> 00:07:05,270
That is why I could not find
the original owners.

56
00:07:05,932 --> 00:07:09,372
You may not know anything

57
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:10,973
but don't you even
know the owner's name?

58
00:07:11,986 --> 00:07:14,311
The servants cannot know
the name of their masters.

59
00:07:15,117 --> 00:07:19,530
He never told me
and I never asked.

60
00:07:19,709 --> 00:07:22,306
Nobody mentioned his name

61
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,750
that is why I never knew.

62
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:28,502
Anyway, don't make
this mistake again

63
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:33,789
for information, you should know
the name of your new employer.

64
00:07:34,878 --> 00:07:36,930
You never know when
the need may arise.

65
00:07:37,106 --> 00:07:42,776
-My name is Hari Shankar.
-What are you saying?

66
00:07:44,272 --> 00:07:48,685
The whole of Cawnpore
and Allahabad know you.

67
00:07:49,491 --> 00:07:51,472
You are the son
of a famous Judge.

68
00:07:53,874 --> 00:07:58,145
May you flourish in this place.

69
00:07:59,233 --> 00:08:03,361
You must be tired
with the journey

70
00:08:03,547 --> 00:08:07,129
you please rest,
your bedroom is there.

71
00:08:08,278 --> 00:08:10,604
Your bed has been laid out.

72
00:08:12,662 --> 00:08:14,773
Are there any other
orders for me, sir?

73
00:08:16,977 --> 00:08:20,761
There is but you cannot carry
out on this stormy night.

74
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:23,897
You tell me sir, don't bother
about my inconvenience.

75
00:08:24,283 --> 00:08:26,264
How far is this mansion
from the city?

76
00:08:26,649 --> 00:08:28,416
Around four miles away.

77
00:08:29,432 --> 00:08:34,332
-Then you will have to walk.
-I will go, sir. You tell me.

78
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:38,156
-Do you know where Georgetown is?
-Which town, sir?

79
00:08:38,547 --> 00:08:40,599
Georgetown, which house
the bungalows of the barristers.

80
00:08:40,774 --> 00:08:41,783
It's close to the High Court.

81
00:08:41,957 --> 00:08:44,697
I know the place, where
do I have to go there?

82
00:08:44,949 --> 00:08:46,859
Go to Barrister
Shivnath's place.

83
00:08:47,037 --> 00:08:49,575
Tell him that his friend
from Cawnpore has come.

84
00:08:50,168 --> 00:08:53,050
Alright, sir.
I will take your leave.

85
00:10:21,435 --> 00:10:25,018
What mystery is this?
Who were you?

86
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,200
Why do you look like me?

87
00:10:40,188 --> 00:10:42,400
Is this your second birth?

What is the matter?

116
00:20:23,437 --> 00:20:26,735
What is the matter, Shankar?
What happened?

117
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:31,948
Wait, let me get
back into senses

118
00:20:33,109 --> 00:20:36,204
I want to be silent
for some time.

119
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,800
Why is my portrait here?

120
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:17,400
Shrinath, did I build this
mansion in my last birth?

121
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:24,500
And to complete my unfulfilled
love story, I have come here?

122
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,600
This is just a coincidence.

123
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:32,600
If it's a coincidence then
it's a very dangerous one.

124
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:39,600
And if that is a coincidence
then what did I see?

125
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,700
Why did I see that ghost?

126
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:49,100
The environment of this place
has influenced you.

127
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:52,600
It was nothing but
a hallucination.

128
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:58,100
No, I am not a hallucination,
I am a reality.

129
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:07,700
I am not a hallucination,
I am a reality.

130
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:27,182
Indeed, this place is very
dangerous and inauspicious.

131
00:22:27,573 --> 00:22:30,313
No wonder your father is
repenting buying this place.

132
00:22:31,053 --> 00:22:34,979
You did a very big mistake by
coming here alone in the night.

133
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:41,448
I came here alone because,
the story which is famous

134
00:22:42,186 --> 00:22:44,167
about this place, I wanted
to experience it myself.

135
00:22:45,317 --> 00:22:50,845
I didn't know this story would
be connected with my last birth.

136
00:22:55,963 --> 00:22:59,604
No, this is not right.

137
00:23:00,278 --> 00:23:01,700
Come with me.

138
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:06,850
You should not
fall for this so soon.

139
00:23:09,601 --> 00:23:12,342
You are an educated man,

140
00:23:13,638 --> 00:23:15,820
use your intelligence.

141
00:23:16,212 --> 00:23:21,455
It would be better
if you went back to Cawnpore.

142
00:23:27,067 --> 00:23:31,480
You did a very wise thing
by agreeing to go back to Cawnpore.

143
00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:35,309
Here, in Allahabad, you wouldn't
forget that unlucky mansion.

144
00:23:35,695 --> 00:23:37,604
And then there would be
more problems.

145
00:23:39,662 --> 00:23:43,500
You are aware that your father
has ordered me that several times.

146
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:47,207
The unlucky property
he has bought by mistake,

147
00:23:47,942 --> 00:23:49,923
I should sell it or auction it
as soon as possible.

148
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:56,737
And even you that going against
your father's wishes

149
00:23:57,336 --> 00:23:58,688
is a very big mistake.

150
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:01,396
You are right.

151
00:24:01,511 --> 00:24:04,251
Therefore, you should be away
from such things.

152
00:24:04,642 --> 00:24:10,857
Because only your fiancee
has a right over your life and thoughts.

153
00:24:11,948 --> 00:24:14,273
You belong to her.

154
00:24:15,219 --> 00:24:18,173
You're right.
But don't sell that mansion.

155
00:24:18,419 --> 00:24:21,230
Tell father that
it cannot be sold.

156
00:24:21,482 --> 00:24:27,840
I may get a shock if it is sold
and I won't be able to bear.

157
00:24:28,648 --> 00:24:30,831
Okay, I am going now.

158
00:24:31,084 --> 00:24:33,824
Listen, few of my things
are left back there.

159
00:24:34,007 --> 00:24:35,823
Please, get them.

160
00:24:35,863 --> 00:24:37,648
Okay, I will go there.

161
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:34,091

I was sure that
you would come back.

Why do you look so surprised?

00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,700

169
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,700
I am not a dream.

00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:57,292
Look at me closely.

00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,300
Don't touch me.

00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:17,200
Just look at me, talk to me.

173
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:21,500
Who are you?

174
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:35,220
In spite of explaining you,
you have come back here?

175
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:40,024
I didn't come,
I was called back.

176
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:44,191
You have been
very unjust to me.

177
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:49,073
I was seeing
a beautiful dream

178
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,811
and you startled me.

179
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:54,355
No, you were intoxicated
by that poison

180
00:28:54,535 --> 00:28:58,118
which you consumed thinking
it was a cold drink, let's go.

181
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,799
Slow poiosn often taste sweet.

182
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:08,904
And deceit is
always beautiful.

183
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,300
And an intelligent man
should know this.

184
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:24,500
♪ O ye, my beloved
♪ will come back

185
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:39,500
♪ O ye, my beloved
♪ will come back

186
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:54,100
♪ O ye, my beloved
♪ will come back

187
00:30:35,449 --> 00:30:40,075
Wait! Have you lost
your senses completely?

188
00:30:41,016 --> 00:30:45,772
Don't you understand your death
is playing tricks on you?

189
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:51,337
Perhaps you are right.

190
00:30:53,192 --> 00:30:55,244
I am feeling very helpless.

191
00:30:55,420 --> 00:31:04,981
Wrong a human being
has a heart and a mind too.

192
00:31:05,647 --> 00:31:08,114
Even when an animal is about
to be trapped in a snare

193
00:31:08,292 --> 00:31:10,617
he tries to save himself.

194
00:31:10,936 --> 00:31:12,917
And you, being a human being
don't get shocked?

195
00:31:13,372 --> 00:31:20,216
Sir, there is no scope
of arguement in this case of love.

196
00:31:21,095 --> 00:31:25,852
You will never win come here.

197
00:31:26,941 --> 00:31:27,949
Come to me.

198
00:31:34,942 --> 00:31:36,994
Sir

199
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,706
it's almost morning,
I am leaving

200
00:31:49,207 --> 00:31:51,188
but I want to tell you that

201
00:31:51,782 --> 00:31:56,409
don't try to come
between him and me

202
00:31:57,209 --> 00:31:58,906
or you shall regret.

203
00:32:23,095 --> 00:32:27,223
-What happened?
-Nothing.

204
00:32:37,498 --> 00:32:40,238
-Who is it?
-I am the gardener, sir.

205
00:32:40,699 --> 00:32:43,439
What happened sir,
what was this explosion?

206
00:32:45,082 --> 00:32:46,221
Come inside.

207
00:32:48,979 --> 00:32:52,834
-Yes, sir?
-The story you told me about this mansion

208
00:32:53,363 --> 00:32:56,245
you forgot to tell me the most
important part of the story.

209
00:32:56,495 --> 00:33:00,836
-Which part?
-The lady who was that man's lover

210
00:33:01,017 --> 00:33:02,570
her spirit roams around
in this mansion.

211
00:33:02,826 --> 00:33:06,681
-No, sir.
-But we have seen her many times.

212
00:33:07,349 --> 00:33:09,188
Perhaps you have hallucinated.

213
00:33:09,367 --> 00:33:11,964
I have been here
for the last 40 years.

214
00:33:12,359 --> 00:33:14,341
I would have surely
seen her once.

215
00:33:17,438 --> 00:33:23,038
It's strange! Okay, you go.

216
00:33:24,815 --> 00:33:27,211
Shall I send tea for you?

217
00:33:45,411 --> 00:33:47,594
I am asking you
for the last time

218
00:33:47,777 --> 00:33:49,129
Your tea, master.

219
00:33:54,735 --> 00:33:58,175
Keep it here. Go.

220
00:34:07,330 --> 00:34:11,458
I am asking for the last time,
won't you leave this evil house?

221
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,000
No.

222
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:18,400
So you have made up your mind
to die here?

223
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:24,618
If this is my fate then
I have no objection to it.

224
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:29,143
Then I will have
to sell this mansion.

225
00:34:30,292 --> 00:34:32,274
Never. You cannot sell it.

226
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:36,400
We will see about it later.

227
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,646
I have come to meet you both
because I need your help.

228
00:34:55,829 --> 00:34:59,613
I am surprised seeing you here.

229
00:34:59,936 --> 00:35:04,277
You never pass this way.
Tell me, what brought you here?

230
00:35:04,666 --> 00:35:10,266
My very close friend has fallen
in the snare of a woman

231
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:12,280
who is deceiving him
in the form of a spirit.

232
00:35:12,599 --> 00:35:14,094
The matter is getting
very critical.

233
00:35:15,104 --> 00:35:18,959
That very soon, either
he will become insane

234
00:35:19,697 --> 00:35:22,022
or will die.

235
00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:23,426
So?

236
00:35:23,466 --> 00:35:24,522
I want to divert
his attention from her

237
00:35:24,707 --> 00:35:33,225
so that we get enough time
to get him married.

238
00:35:34,310 --> 00:35:40,110
You both are famous for helping men
who have strayed

239
00:35:40,224 --> 00:35:43,249
that is why
I have come to you.

240
00:35:44,539 --> 00:35:48,465
But we are poison and you
want to use us as medicine?

241
00:35:48,922 --> 00:35:51,318
Won't it be reverse?

242
00:35:51,914 --> 00:35:55,769
I know it but
some deadly diseases

243
00:35:57,064 --> 00:35:58,558
are cured with poison.

244
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:04,189
In pain, morphine injection
is administered before medicine.

245
00:36:05,274 --> 00:36:07,326
Okay, you tell me the rates.

246
00:36:09,727 --> 00:36:16,015
Get the patient, money will be
decided on seeing the sickness.

247
00:36:16,164 --> 00:36:19,770
I will get him here
under some pretext.

248
00:36:21,904 --> 00:36:26,032
But he shouldn't think anything
else after he comes here.

249
00:36:26,149 --> 00:36:32,306
Be careful that the snare
you make should not be weak and loose.

250
00:36:32,411 --> 00:36:34,393
Let him come here.

251
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,612
He will come.

252
00:36:44,867 --> 00:36:46,919
He has come here.

253
00:36:47,024 --> 00:36:51,093
Make him wait until midnight and
see to it that he doesn't leave.

254
00:36:58,435 --> 00:37:00,487
I am sorry but
you will have to wait.

255
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:03,618
-How long?
-For some time.

256
00:37:04,698 --> 00:37:06,750
Alright, I will wait.

257
00:37:06,855 --> 00:37:10,924
But do inform her that
I am anxious to meet her.

258
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:13,355
I will convey your message.

259
00:37:13,466 --> 00:37:15,090
Thank you.

260
00:37:41,229 --> 00:37:43,281
Will I have to wait more?

261
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:47,455
-Are you bored?
-No, but…

262
00:37:47,561 --> 00:37:49,543
Then wait for some more time.

263
00:37:49,649 --> 00:37:54,761
But for how long?
I hope it's not for ages.

264
00:37:54,868 --> 00:37:59,980
I could be for ages but for you,
the wait is for few hours.

265
00:38:00,086 --> 00:38:03,111
The wait differs
from person to person.

266
00:38:08,367 --> 00:38:10,419
Please come, sir.

267
00:38:41,767 --> 00:38:43,819
Please come.

268
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:53,212
Please, sit.

269
00:39:00,554 --> 00:39:04,682
I am sorry that
you had to wait for so long.

270
00:39:04,799 --> 00:39:07,824
You look quite disturbed.

271
00:39:13,079 --> 00:39:17,207
I received
your notice this evening.

272
00:39:17,324 --> 00:39:21,393
I have come here
to discuss about it.

273
00:39:22,473 --> 00:39:24,525
Tell me.

274
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:28,699
This notice says that
the mansion called Sangam Bhavan

275
00:39:28,805 --> 00:39:31,830
has been bought by you.

276
00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:37,039
Therefore, I'll have to vacate
that place as soon as possible.

277
00:39:37,155 --> 00:39:41,912
But I cannot leave it.

278
00:39:43,348 --> 00:39:45,400
That is why I have come
here with a request

279
00:39:46,479 --> 00:39:50,607
that you have mercy on me
and sell it back to me.

280
00:39:51,698 --> 00:39:55,826
I will pay the price
you ask for.

281
00:39:56,917 --> 00:40:01,045
And all my life,
I will be indebted by your favor.

282
00:40:12,573 --> 00:40:14,625
Please, tell me.

283
00:40:19,879 --> 00:40:26,095
If you would earnestly ask for us,
we would not refuse you.

284
00:40:27,185 --> 00:40:33,401
I am glad that you didn't
ask for our heart.

285
00:40:35,535 --> 00:40:38,631
We will return that mansion
back to you.

286
00:40:38,737 --> 00:40:41,762
But on one condition.

287
00:40:41,868 --> 00:40:43,360
What?

288
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:48,025
We've heard that you are
a very good artist.

289
00:40:48,130 --> 00:40:49,460
Tell me.

290
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:52,072
Make a portrait
of us sisters

291
00:40:52,112 --> 00:40:57,418
in a way that it feels
the magic is one but the chants are two.

292
00:41:03,717 --> 00:41:05,769
I did not understand.

293
00:41:06,848 --> 00:41:12,020
You didn't? One arrow
and two bows.

294
00:41:12,137 --> 00:41:16,205
One view, two eyes.

295
00:41:16,312 --> 00:41:19,337
I still don't understand
the meaning.

296
00:41:19,443 --> 00:41:23,512
Okay wait, let me explain.

297
00:41:25,636 --> 00:41:27,688
Chandni, play the music.

298
00:41:46,511 --> 00:41:52,726
♪ Listen to me, O my dear

299
00:41:53,817 --> 00:42:00,032

I got your prey
right up to you

315
00:47:11,187 --> 00:47:15,256
and you could not even
ensnare him?

316
00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:19,432
You have ruined everything.

317
00:47:21,555 --> 00:47:26,726
Once the bird is out of
the cage, he flies even higher.

318
00:47:28,861 --> 00:47:31,957
Anyway, I will think
of some other way.

319
00:49:51,055 --> 00:49:53,107
Are you very restless for me?

320
00:49:53,212 --> 00:49:55,193
Yes.

321
00:49:59,405 --> 00:50:03,533
Do you know the consequences
of your restlessness?

322
00:50:05,667 --> 00:50:07,719
My death.

323
00:50:09,842 --> 00:50:13,970
-Have you decided?
-Look at me closely.

324
00:50:23,411 --> 00:50:25,463
Do you need an answer?

325
00:50:31,761 --> 00:50:37,977
Come if you are ready to die.

326
00:51:24,992 --> 00:51:30,164
-Where does this path lead?
-Don't you remember?

327
00:51:32,299 --> 00:51:34,351
You don't remember anything.

328
00:51:36,474 --> 00:51:41,645
A human being forgets
his last birth.

329
00:51:44,824 --> 00:51:47,919
That is why even
you have forgotten

330
00:51:48,025 --> 00:51:52,093
that you were my lover
in the last birth.

331
00:52:05,699 --> 00:52:10,871
This secret passageway leads
to the center of the mansion.

332
00:52:19,267 --> 00:52:21,320
You used to come to meet me
through this way.

333
00:52:21,425 --> 00:52:28,626
But I am not dead. That is why
I remember the past so well.

334
00:52:29,705 --> 00:52:33,833
You loved me
with utmost passion.

335
00:52:37,011 --> 00:52:44,272
You hid me here in this mansion,
away from the eyes of the world.

336
00:52:45,361 --> 00:52:51,577
I anxiously passed the hours
in the day to see you in the night.

337
00:52:51,694 --> 00:52:57,851
And you would come to meet me
every night, at any cost.

338
00:52:58,930 --> 00:53:05,146
And one night, on your way here,
you were enveloped by the river.

339
00:53:08,324 --> 00:53:12,452
And I died a torturous
death thinking about you.

340
00:53:12,569 --> 00:53:15,594
I remember it vividly.

341
00:53:18,761 --> 00:53:24,977
You took another birth and
were free from the woes of last birth

342
00:53:26,068 --> 00:53:31,239
But I have been wandering
around, looking for you

343
00:53:31,356 --> 00:53:39,601
sometimes in the valley of death
and sometimes on the road of life.

344
00:53:41,724 --> 00:53:45,852
And then you came
and I recognized you.

345
00:53:47,986 --> 00:53:54,202
You may not remember me but
my love nestles in your heart.

346
00:53:54,319 --> 00:53:57,344
And that has pulled you here.

347
00:53:57,450 --> 00:54:02,562
My love has compelled you
to die for me

348
00:54:02,669 --> 00:54:05,694
because, this is the only way
we both can unite.

349
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:10,912
If you die, your physical being
which is a barrier between us

350
00:54:11,019 --> 00:54:18,220
will fall and
our souls will unite.

351
00:54:37,043 --> 00:54:46,390
Come to unite with me,
you will have to jump in that river.

352
00:54:51,655 --> 00:54:52,663
Alright.

353
00:54:57,918 --> 00:54:59,970
But wait a minute

354
00:55:02,093 --> 00:55:07,264
I am afraid, what if again

355
00:55:10,443 --> 00:55:16,658
you disappear
in the darkness of death?

356
00:55:16,775 --> 00:55:21,887
-Then?
-I can come back to life.

357
00:55:22,968 --> 00:55:28,139
-How?
-Come, let me explain.

358
00:55:29,230 --> 00:55:33,358
If my spirit enters the body
of any such woman

359
00:55:33,475 --> 00:55:38,587
whom you like and can kill

360
00:55:38,694 --> 00:55:41,719
In that case, it is impossible
to get you alive.

361
00:55:41,825 --> 00:55:46,937
You don't have to find
such a woman, I'll tell you about her.

362
00:55:49,061 --> 00:55:56,322
A beautiful woman lives here,
with a veil covering her face

363
00:55:56,438 --> 00:56:00,506
and she serves you everyday.

364
00:56:00,613 --> 00:56:05,725
-Who is she?
-The gardener's daughter.

365
00:56:05,831 --> 00:56:07,812
-The gardener's daughter?.
-Yes.

366
00:56:07,919 --> 00:56:13,031
You lift her veil,
you may perhaps like her.

367
00:56:13,138 --> 00:56:17,206
And we may find
a way of our union.

368
00:56:18,286 --> 00:56:21,899
Alright.

369
00:56:21,939 --> 00:56:25,593
But before I come
in the form of that woman

370
00:56:25,593 --> 00:56:32,853
I want to be sure that
you won't change seeing me in her body.

371
00:56:38,118 --> 00:56:44,333
Forget her, I am willing to
accept you even as a serpent.

372
00:56:47,511 --> 00:56:50,607
-Then when should I come?
-Right now.

373
00:56:51,686 --> 00:56:54,782
I will vacate that body
for you right away.

374
00:56:54,888 --> 00:56:58,956
No, don't be in such a hurry.

375
00:56:59,063 --> 00:57:04,100
-Then when?
-When she gets tea for you in the morning.

376
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:08,351
You look at her closely

377
00:57:08,456 --> 00:57:11,481
and then decide.

378
00:57:12,561 --> 00:57:15,657
Now you go

379
00:57:19,868 --> 00:57:22,964
and wait for
the beautiful morning of our union.

380
00:57:36,568 --> 00:57:39,699
-Open the door.
-Who is it?

381
00:57:39,699 --> 00:57:44,871
Master?! What happened?

382
00:57:44,988 --> 00:57:46,969
Yes, master?

383
00:57:47,075 --> 00:57:50,100
Get the tea early
in the morning.

384
00:57:50,206 --> 00:57:52,188
Alright, sir.

385
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:58,450
-What is the matter, sir?
-Nothing.

386
00:57:58,556 --> 00:58:04,200
-Send the tea early.
-Shall I send it at 8 a. M?

387
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:07,300
No, at 6 a.m.

388
00:58:29,799 --> 00:58:32,895
Asha, wake up.

389
01:00:00,605 --> 01:00:02,657
No, I will not go.

390
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:51,600
Is he dead?

391
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,889
No, he is alive.

392
01:00:55,994 --> 01:00:59,019
Then take him along.

393
01:01:22,462 --> 01:01:24,514
Wait.

394
01:01:40,206 --> 01:01:42,258
Shiv, you go inside.

395
01:01:56,906 --> 01:01:58,958
Didn't you listen to me?

396
01:02:03,168 --> 01:02:05,220
Come with me.

397
01:02:11,518 --> 01:02:13,570
Sit down.

398
01:02:22,999 --> 01:02:28,171
Do you want to die running
after a shadow?

399
01:02:29,262 --> 01:02:35,477
Do you want to do injustice
to your fiancee without a reason?

400
01:02:37,612 --> 01:02:39,664
Look at me.

401
01:02:40,743 --> 01:02:45,915
You want to kill living beings
and bring the dead alive?

402
01:02:47,006 --> 01:02:49,058
Don't you want that?

403
01:02:52,224 --> 01:02:55,320
You can go if you want

404
01:02:58,487 --> 01:03:03,659
but only by moving me
from your path.

405
01:03:04,749 --> 01:03:12,010
And it won't be easy to move me
and walk towards your doom.

406
01:03:18,318 --> 01:03:21,414
I hope you know that? And yet,
if you insist on going

407
01:03:21,519 --> 01:03:23,500
then take this.

408
01:03:26,668 --> 01:03:29,764
Come on, take it.

409
01:03:36,062 --> 01:03:39,158
Now move me from your path.

410
01:03:39,263 --> 01:03:42,288
I asked Shiv to go
because, whatever

411
01:03:42,394 --> 01:03:46,463
would transpire between
you and me

412
01:03:46,569 --> 01:03:50,638
there should be
no witness to it.

413
01:03:50,744 --> 01:03:54,813
I have written a suicide note
that I am responsible.

414
01:03:55,893 --> 01:04:00,021
Pick up the gun,
what are you seeing?

415
01:04:01,112 --> 01:04:05,240
Shoot me, I am quite tough.

416
01:04:06,331 --> 01:04:10,459
And your aim is
also not that bad.

417
01:04:13,637 --> 01:04:15,689
Pick up the gun.

418
01:04:20,943 --> 01:04:22,995
Shoot me.

419
01:05:12,087 --> 01:05:14,139
What did you gain by doing this?

420
01:05:20,437 --> 01:05:27,697
That picture signified, even
I was happy once upon a time.

421
01:05:28,787 --> 01:05:30,839
I have ruined that today.

422
01:05:31,918 --> 01:05:35,014
My joys have been killed.

423
01:05:37,137 --> 01:05:42,309
I have yielded to my friends
and well wishers advice.

424
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:45,260
You have done the right thing.

425
01:05:45,300 --> 01:05:50,669
You will know later
how happy and peaceful you are.

426
01:05:50,776 --> 01:05:55,888
Pain can be created with
an incsion of an operation

427
01:05:55,994 --> 01:06:00,063
which is done
to cure a person.

428
01:06:02,187 --> 01:06:06,315
One day, you will forget
all the pain inflicted upon you.

429
01:06:13,668 --> 01:06:17,796
Yes, I will forget everything.

430
01:06:17,913 --> 01:06:21,982
I will stifle my feelings.

431
01:06:23,062 --> 01:06:27,190
I will forget her.

432
01:06:29,700 --> 01:06:44,000
♪ It is difficult

433
01:06:51,700 --> 01:07:04,200
♪ It is very difficult

441
01:10:25,212 --> 01:10:29,340
A bride hidden in her veil
looks very pretty.

442
01:10:30,431 --> 01:10:35,603
Like a dice in the palm, who can
make you win when it's opened.

443
01:10:36,694 --> 01:10:41,865
Tell me, what are
you going to win?

444
01:10:41,982 --> 01:10:48,139
For whom will you play,
for me or against me?

445
01:10:50,262 --> 01:10:53,358
At this moment,
you are my fate

446
01:10:53,463 --> 01:10:57,532
and my heart is beating
to catch a glimpse of you.

447
01:10:57,638 --> 01:11:01,707
Are you beautiful?

448
01:11:02,787 --> 01:11:05,883
Aren't you beautiful?

449
01:11:16,356 --> 01:11:20,484
Your hands are
beautiful and fair too

450
01:11:21,575 --> 01:11:24,671
it's shapely and fragile too.

451
01:11:32,500 --> 01:11:36,152
Now I would like to lift
your veil and look at my future.

452
01:11:39,319 --> 01:11:43,447
You are feeling shy? Of me?

453
01:11:46,625 --> 01:11:49,800
Oh! You are feeling shy
of the light? Alright.

454
01:12:11,500 --> 01:12:14,660
Now lift up your veil

455
01:12:14,700 --> 01:12:19,988
and let me see
how bright my future shines.

456
01:12:20,095 --> 01:12:25,207
Let me see the glow
of your face.

457
01:12:33,594 --> 01:12:41,898
♪ O ye, my beloved
♪ will come back

458
01:13:01,300 --> 01:13:02,600
Thank you.

459
01:13:04,100 --> 01:13:10,000
I am glad you reminded me that
I am caged too, just like you.

460
01:13:12,300 --> 01:13:17,200
I am helpless.

461
01:13:30,900 --> 01:13:32,900
What happened, Ranjana?

462
01:13:35,175 --> 01:13:38,271
Sister in law, I was humiliated.

463
01:13:39,300 --> 01:13:42,446
He was about to lift my veil

464
01:13:42,551 --> 01:13:47,663
and left it as if he stopped
himself from committing a sin.

465
01:13:47,770 --> 01:13:54,971
He went away outside leaving me
stunned and baffled.

466
01:13:58,138 --> 01:14:00,190
Didn't he come back?

467
01:14:00,295 --> 01:14:03,320
It would be better
if he would not come back.

468
01:14:03,426 --> 01:14:09,619
The fate of my future would
have been decided that time itself.

469
01:14:09,619 --> 01:14:14,260
But he came back
after some time and said

470
01:14:14,300 --> 01:14:25,239
that he would take me far away
and there he would love me.

471
01:14:25,345 --> 01:14:29,414
But I didn't understand
the meaning of his words.

472
01:14:35,713 --> 01:14:40,884
I fear that every night,
at the strike of 2 a.m.

473
01:14:41,001 --> 01:14:48,201
some clock will carry her message
that I shouldn't forget her.

474
01:14:48,307 --> 01:14:53,420
I got her message last night
too and I became restless

475
01:14:55,544 --> 01:14:59,672
that is why I want to go
to some desolate place

476
01:14:59,789 --> 01:15:03,857
where I cannot hear her.

477
01:15:04,938 --> 01:15:09,066
And I can do justice
with my poor wife.

478
01:15:09,182 --> 01:15:15,340
Whose love has to survive
amidst the storm in my life.

479
01:15:29,988 --> 01:15:33,083
-Whose letter is it?
-Your sister's.

480
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:42,800
<i>Sister in law, it's been</i>
<i>two years but</i>

481
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:47,900
<i>the veil of the nuptial night</i>
<i>still covers my face</i>

482
01:15:48,300 --> 01:15:54,991
<i>and I feel that this veil</i>
<i>will never be uncovered</i>

483
01:15:55,900 --> 01:15:59,060
<i>because, even I have</i>
<i>made up my mind that</i>

484
01:15:59,100 --> 01:16:03,260
<i>until he doesn't</i>
<i>uncover my veil</i>

485
01:16:03,300 --> 01:16:06,482
<i>I will not show him my face</i>

486
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:12,390
<i>I still have not understood</i>
<i>what kind of a man he is</i>

487
01:16:12,781 --> 01:16:17,953
<i>but he is cast over my life</i>
<i>like a deadly, deep secret</i>

488
01:16:19,044 --> 01:16:24,216
<i>and I fear him,</i>
<i>since the time we left home.</i>

489
01:16:24,333 --> 01:16:31,533
<i>I want you to know</i>
<i>what I have been going through</i>

490
01:16:32,100 --> 01:16:34,000
<i>Do you realize what a deadly</i>
<i>experience that was?</i>

491
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:52,900
I can't walk anymore.

492
01:16:54,500 --> 01:17:00,400
Be bold Ranjana, you still
have to travel a lot with me.

493
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:05,500
-I am very tired.
-Alright, rest for some time.

494
01:17:06,083 --> 01:17:10,839
No sir, it is very dangerous
to stay here in the night.

495
01:17:10,900 --> 01:17:15,060
On that hillock
is a famous rest house.

496
01:17:15,100 --> 01:17:18,060
By nightfall,
we will reach there.

497
01:17:18,100 --> 01:17:20,589
Let's go.

498
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:26,600
Be alert.

499
01:17:27,800 --> 01:17:31,000
-What happened?
-What is down there?

500
01:17:32,500 --> 01:17:34,500
It looks like a sea of fire.

501
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:40,800
It's not a sea of fire,
the tribe of this area

502
01:17:40,840 --> 01:17:44,460
are taking a woman
who has sinned

503
01:17:44,500 --> 01:17:47,726
to the temple of their deity,
so that she can be put to trial.

504
01:17:47,700 --> 01:17:49,100
What trial?

505
01:17:49,140 --> 01:17:55,500
To see if her husband's
accusation infidelty are right.

506
01:17:55,540 --> 01:17:57,000
How will they know it?

507
01:17:57,400 --> 01:18:00,900
She will dance in front
of the deity

508
01:18:00,940 --> 01:18:05,800
and in the middle of the dance,
the priest will aim

509
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:08,200
four knives one by one,
on her

510
01:18:08,240 --> 01:18:10,800
if she is not pierced
by a single knife

511
01:18:10,840 --> 01:18:12,300
then she will be
considered innocent.

512
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:15,600
It's a strange custom
Can we go there?

513
01:18:16,300 --> 01:18:18,900
No, we will not go there.

514
01:18:18,940 --> 01:18:23,400
Why not, if she doesn't die,
she will be proven innocent.

515

-You committed this murder?
-No.

670
02:02:32,687 --> 02:02:36,292
Yes, you have.
You hated your wife.

671
02:02:36,687 --> 02:02:39,084
And because of this hatred,
you poisoned her.

672
02:02:39,297 --> 02:02:41,932
No.

673
02:02:41,972 --> 02:02:44,647

02:03:14,706 --> 02:03:17,802
None of them is your wife.

680
02:03:18,186 --> 02:03:21,970
You surely cannot indentify her.

681
02:03:22,187 --> 02:03:26,149
You yourself said that
you have never seen your wife.

682
02:03:26,362 --> 02:03:31,059
You hated her and commited
atrocities on her.

683
02:03:31,059 --> 02:03:34,499
These are the letters
written by her, you killed her

684
02:03:34,712 --> 02:03:37,629
and the proof is this
testimony of your wife,

685
02:03:37,843 --> 02:03:41,449
which is in the police register
along with her signature.

686
02:03:41,844 --> 02:03:47,194
Ashamalan, daughter of Krishna,
please be present.

687
02:03:54,369 --> 02:03:58,544
She is the vile woman,
that sorceress

688
02:03:58,544 --> 02:04:02,328
because of whom,
this cruel man

689
02:04:02,719 --> 02:04:06,847
poisoned his innocent
and feeble wife.

690
02:04:07,068 --> 02:04:10,373
She is the vicious woman
who instigated him

691
02:04:10,373 --> 02:04:12,911
to commit this heinous offense.

692
02:04:17,331 --> 02:04:20,427
I object this accusation.

693
02:04:22,550 --> 02:04:24,946
The story of the accused
with this woman

694
02:04:25,160 --> 02:04:28,421
on which the public prosecutor
is stressing, is fabricated.

695
02:04:28,813 --> 02:04:33,296
And to prove my claim,
I present this evidence.

696
02:04:35,075 --> 02:04:40,247
This beautiful
and alluring face

697
02:04:40,468 --> 02:04:44,430
is of the woman who
was killed for her sake.

698
02:04:44,643 --> 02:04:49,293
I would like to question
the esteemed jury

699
02:04:49,688 --> 02:04:55,560
can you believe that an
illiterate gardener's daughter

700
02:04:55,950 --> 02:05:00,078
this shabbily dressed woman

701
02:05:00,299 --> 02:05:04,783
could be the reason for
a beautiful woman's murder?

702
02:05:05,344 --> 02:05:07,396
This ugly woman

703
02:05:14,738 --> 02:05:19,565
My real name is Asha.

704
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:25,128
I am the daughter of Krisha,
the gardener.

705
02:05:26,219 --> 02:05:30,347
The statement which
I am about to make

706
02:05:30,464 --> 02:05:33,489
every word of my statement
is worth pondering.

707
02:05:33,595 --> 02:05:36,620
That is why I request

708
02:05:36,726 --> 02:05:42,883
everyone to please listen
to my testimony carefully.

709
02:05:42,989 --> 02:05:48,101
The love story which is famous
connected with that mansion

710
02:05:48,207 --> 02:05:51,232
I too had heard that story from
my father several times.

711
02:05:52,313 --> 02:05:57,484
When I grew up, a desire
rose in my heart too.

712
02:05:58,575 --> 02:06:02,703
that I should also be loved
in the same manner

713
02:06:02,820 --> 02:06:05,845
but who could love a gardener's
daughter with so much passion?

714
02:06:05,951 --> 02:06:10,020
I could understand
this truth.

715
02:06:10,126 --> 02:06:16,282
That is why I thought of a new plan
to fulfill my desire.

716
02:06:16,389 --> 02:06:20,457
I would stealthily enter
the house at midnight

717
02:06:20,564 --> 02:06:26,721
and pretend to be the woman
who was loved in that palace.

718
02:06:27,800 --> 02:06:34,016
I would pretend to love
the man who built that house.

719
02:06:35,106 --> 02:06:40,278
Gradually, I was obsessed with
the idea that I am the woman.

720
02:06:40,395 --> 02:06:48,640
I fell in love with the picture
of the man who built the house.

721
02:06:48,745 --> 02:06:54,902
And then one night,
when I entered the mansion

722
02:06:55,981 --> 02:06:58,033
I saw him.

723
02:07:02,244 --> 02:07:05,340
First, I got scared and hid

724
02:07:05,445 --> 02:07:10,557
but then I saw his face
clearly, I was stunned.

725
02:07:11,638 --> 02:07:16,810
He looked exactly like
the man in the picture.

726
02:07:17,900 --> 02:07:24,116
He was the one for whom
I waited so long.

727
02:07:24,233 --> 02:07:28,301
He was born again and had
come to the same mansion.

728
02:07:29,381 --> 02:07:31,433
I was hiding and watching him.

729
02:07:33,556 --> 02:07:38,728
He saw his own picture.

730
02:07:38,845 --> 02:07:45,002
He had about me and started
thinking I was his Kamini.

731
02:07:46,081 --> 02:07:51,253
I took advantage of
the situation and decided

732
02:07:52,344 --> 02:07:57,516
that I would trap him
in my love

733
02:07:58,606 --> 02:08:03,778
and to convince him that
I am Kamini's spirit

734
02:08:04,869 --> 02:08:07,965
I took him along the secret
ways of the mansion.

735
02:08:09,044 --> 02:08:13,172
I feared that before my love
progressed, if he would know

736
02:08:13,289 --> 02:08:20,490
who I am then my beautiful
dream would get shattered.

737
02:08:26,788 --> 02:08:28,840
And when I was sure

738
02:08:29,919 --> 02:08:35,091
that even if he would know
I am the gardener's daughter

739
02:08:36,182 --> 02:08:38,234
he would not hate me

740
02:08:39,313 --> 02:08:44,485
I decided to reveal
my true self to him.

741
02:08:46,619 --> 02:08:49,715
I told him that

742
02:08:50,794 --> 02:08:55,966
I could be alive if he would
like to see me her body

743
02:08:56,083 --> 02:09:02,240
then he should kill her so
that I could enter her body.

744
02:09:11,669 --> 02:09:18,929
What I meant was that when
he opens that girl's veil

745
02:09:19,045 --> 02:09:25,202
he would recognize me.

746
02:09:28,369 --> 02:09:36,673
I intentionally played
this dangerous game

747
02:09:36,789 --> 02:09:39,114
I could have even lost my life.

748
02:09:39,329 --> 02:09:45,023
But I was in love with him.

749
02:09:46,113 --> 02:09:49,209
I was even ready to die.

750
02:09:52,375 --> 02:09:54,427
But unfortunately

751
02:09:55,507 --> 02:10:00,678
neither did I die nor
did I get him.

752
02:10:03,857 --> 02:10:07,985
And my beautiful dream
was shattered.

753
02:10:11,163 --> 02:10:17,378
Your honor, members of the jury,
the accused is innocent.

754
02:10:18,469 --> 02:10:24,685
He is not guilty.

755
02:10:26,819 --> 02:10:31,991
I start my defense
with these words.

756
02:10:35,169 --> 02:10:42,439
The claim that for his debase reasons
the accused murdered his wife.

757
02:10:42,545 --> 02:10:46,614
This is an allegation,
there is no evidence to prove it.

758
02:10:46,720 --> 02:10:50,789
Making false accusations
in a serious case of homicide

759
02:10:50,895 --> 02:10:56,008
and fabricating stories is like
committing one more murder.

760
02:10:57,088 --> 02:11:02,260
Loving someone and not being
able to forget that person,

761
02:11:02,377 --> 02:11:05,401
is it written in any book
of law that it is a crime?

762
02:11:05,508 --> 02:11:10,620
The accused tried his best
to forget his love

763
02:11:11,700 --> 02:11:16,872
but the so called innocent girl,
raked his wounds

764
02:11:16,989 --> 02:11:22,101
which wanted to heal and provoked
the fire which wanted to douse.

765
02:11:22,208 --> 02:11:27,320
Even she committed a sin which
is proved by these letters.

766
02:11:28,400 --> 02:11:33,572
She tortured herself to death.

767
02:11:35,707 --> 02:11:40,879
If you want to punish
an innocent man

768
02:11:40,995 --> 02:11:48,195
for the crime of this woman
who is helpless himself

769
02:11:48,302 --> 02:11:56,191
then forget about the law
and order that prevails.

770
02:11:58,669 --> 02:12:01,765
Members of the jury,
look here

771
02:12:01,870 --> 02:12:04,895
Iook into these barren eyes

772
02:12:05,002 --> 02:12:07,671
which carries an image
of a ruined life.

773
02:12:08,063 --> 02:12:11,159
Tell me, can you find
a trace of blood in them?

774
02:12:11,264 --> 02:12:15,333
Tell me, can you see
a spark in them

775
02:12:15,439 --> 02:12:18,464
which can be seen
in the eyes of a murderer?

776
02:12:18,570 --> 02:12:22,639
People who can differentiate
between good and bad

777
02:12:22,745 --> 02:12:26,814
you know that

778
02:12:27,894 --> 02:12:33,066
I have no written answer
to these claims

779
02:12:34,157 --> 02:12:37,253
therefore, please don't decide
on the basis of these letters

780
02:12:37,358 --> 02:12:40,383
don't forget that

781
02:12:43,620 --> 02:12:48,377
Jury, before you decide
the fate of the accused

782
02:12:48,769 --> 02:12:51,865
try to judge and
know very well that

783
02:12:51,970 --> 02:12:59,171
is this murder been an
allegation or committed by him.

784
02:12:59,277 --> 02:13:02,823
Remember my words that

785
02:13:03,035 --> 02:13:07,518
the accused is innocent.

786
02:13:07,627 --> 02:13:11,695
He is innocent!.

787
02:13:16,951 --> 02:13:21,079
But the court and
the jury thinks

788
02:13:21,195 --> 02:13:23,177
that the accused is guilty.

789
02:13:23,283 --> 02:13:27,352
Therefore, with deep regret

790
02:13:27,458 --> 02:13:30,483
we announce a capital
punishment for the accused.

791
02:14:17,488 --> 02:14:20,584
I have called you here
to tell you that

792
02:14:20,689 --> 02:14:23,714
I am going to die tomorrow.

793
02:14:24,794 --> 02:14:28,922
But you don't get
disheartened and feel sad.

794
02:14:30,013 --> 02:14:32,065
We shall meet again.

795
02:14:32,170 --> 02:14:37,805
-Where?
-In this world.

796
02:14:38,363 --> 02:14:40,415
I will come back.

797
02:14:40,520 --> 02:14:42,502
I will be born again.

798
02:14:42,608 --> 02:14:47,720
I have been born several times
in search of my love

799
02:14:49,844 --> 02:14:55,016
I will endure one more death.

800
02:14:56,107 --> 02:14:58,159
I will be born again.

801
02:14:59,238 --> 02:15:05,454
My love, my thirst, the love
for me in your eyes

802
02:15:05,571 --> 02:15:07,552
will pull me back here.

803
02:15:07,658 --> 02:15:11,727
But you don't die for me.

804
02:15:11,833 --> 02:15:15,902
Because if you die then in
the barren land of death

805
02:15:16,008 --> 02:15:24,253
we will unite but I don't
want to belong to you there.

806
02:15:25,402 --> 02:15:31,559
I want to get you here,
where I have always loved you

807
02:15:32,638 --> 02:15:35,734
I have been unsuccessful
and have gone back

808
02:15:35,839 --> 02:15:38,864
I am going to be hanged

809
02:15:38,971 --> 02:15:41,995
and I want to get you
in this world.

810
02:15:43,146 --> 02:15:46,170
That is why I want
a sacrifice from you.

811
02:15:46,277 --> 02:15:50,690
I want you to be snatched away
from me in this birth

812
02:15:51,426 --> 02:15:54,521
so that you are born again
for my sake

813
02:15:57,688 --> 02:16:00,784
I know it's
a very big sacrifice.

814
02:16:01,863 --> 02:16:07,035
But Kamini, if you want that
we should meet again

815
02:16:09,169 --> 02:16:12,265
then you will have to
pass this trial.

816
02:16:14,388 --> 02:16:19,560
Tell me, what have you decided?

817
02:16:20,651 --> 02:16:32,097
For you and to get you
I will pass any trial.

818
02:16:34,219 --> 02:16:38,348
You are very precious
for me and I want you.

819
02:16:40,482 --> 02:16:44,610
The sacrifice
you have asked for

820
02:16:44,727 --> 02:16:49,839
is far more difficult
than dying thousand deaths.

821
02:16:49,946 --> 02:16:55,746
And for a woman,
it is all the more difficult.

822
02:16:56,138 --> 02:17:01,310
But if I can get you
back at this cost

823
02:17:03,445 --> 02:17:06,540
then it won't be
an expensive deal for me.

824
02:17:09,707 --> 02:17:11,759
I am ready.

825
02:17:24,320 --> 02:17:29,491
-You heard our conversation?
-Yes, I heard.

826
02:17:32,670 --> 02:17:38,885
I want a final favor from you
in return of our friendship.

827
02:17:41,020 --> 02:17:46,191
Before I die, snatch away
my Kamini from me

828
02:17:46,308 --> 02:17:50,899
You get married to her

829
02:17:51,457 --> 02:17:57,673
so that I feel the pain
of this seperation in this very birth.

830
02:17:59,807 --> 02:18:02,903
And I don't have to endure any
other pains in the next birth.

831
02:18:03,982 --> 02:18:06,034
What are you saying?

832
02:18:06,139 --> 02:18:10,208
Don't argue with me.
I don't have more time.

833
02:18:10,419 --> 02:18:14,381
Answer me, yes or no?

834
02:18:14,594 --> 02:18:19,600
Shrinath, you have tried
everything to save me.

835
02:18:19,812 --> 02:18:22,730
Make one more last attempt.

836
02:18:22,944 --> 02:18:29,159
Do it today so that tomorrow,
I can see from the gallows

837
02:18:29,380 --> 02:18:32,476
that you snatched away
my Kamini from me in my interest.

838
02:18:33,207 --> 02:18:37,335
And to get her
in the next birth

839
02:18:37,556 --> 02:18:40,474
I have intimated my fate.

840
02:18:54,082 --> 02:18:57,178
Look at me for some time

841
02:19:01,388 --> 02:19:04,484
I want to look at you
to my heart's content.

842
02:19:10,782 --> 02:19:24,306
We have recieved a letter and
the contents are very dangerous.

843
02:20:16,538 --> 02:20:23,845
-What is it?
-A woman has written that

844
02:20:23,845 --> 02:20:29,539
she is committing suicide and

845
02:20:29,760 --> 02:20:33,200
she holds her husband
responsible for it.

846
02:20:33,413 --> 02:20:37,413
-Where is the letter from?
-The address says Cawnpore.

847
02:20:37,413 --> 02:20:39,466
And it's sent from Allahabad.

848
02:20:39,675 --> 02:20:42,937
The address of the sender
is not known.

849
02:20:43,676 --> 02:20:46,072
We are trying to
locate her husband.

850
02:20:46,800 --> 02:20:49,500
-What is the name of the sender?
-Ranjana.

851
02:21:10,814 --> 02:21:14,942
“Sister in law,
after a great pain

852
02:21:15,163 --> 02:21:17,380
I have known his secret

853
02:21:17,598 --> 02:21:23,293
I know he is not mine
and can never belong to me

854
02:21:23,513 --> 02:21:26,430
but I did not give up.

855
02:21:28,557 --> 02:21:35,818
If I cannot get him here,
I will get him in another world

856
02:21:36,907 --> 02:21:40,691
and to get him, I am going
towards my death

857
02:21:43,170 --> 02:21:50,430
and I am dying accusing him
of poisoning me

858
02:21:50,650 --> 02:21:53,607
so that he gets
death sentence for killing me

859
02:21:53,607 --> 02:21:58,258
and comes to me.”

860
02:22:00,914 --> 02:22:05,042
This letter proves that
she committed suicide.

861
02:22:06,800 --> 02:22:10,960
And this is the police report
regarding her signatures.

862
02:22:14,482 --> 02:22:19,654
Now you have look at them
closely and decide

863
02:22:20,600 --> 02:22:28,005
that are wrong evidences taking
an innocent man to the gallows?

864
02:23:04,582 --> 02:23:06,979
These are the orders
from the Chief Justice.

865
02:23:32,764 --> 02:23:34,816
Who is it?

866
02:24:11,382 --> 02:24:18,460
I tried to run a lot

867
02:24:18,500 --> 02:24:32,100
but I am glad
that my fate injured me again.

868
02:24:38,520 --> 02:24:44,736
Indeed after this
final sacrifice,

869
02:24:44,957 --> 02:24:48,919
after this,
nothing will be left to achieve.

870
02:25:05,657 --> 02:25:09,786
I am sorry that my last favor
proved to be expensive for you.

871
02:25:10,007 --> 02:25:12,924
My friendship has caused
you a great loss.

872
02:25:14,008 --> 02:25:19,179
But I shall make up
for all the loses.

873
02:25:21,314 --> 02:25:26,533
Don't feel disheartened,
the dilemma in which you are

874
02:25:26,533 --> 02:25:30,661
I have a solution
for that problem.

875
02:25:31,404 --> 02:25:37,976
Look at me.
Don't feel so sad.

876
02:25:39,058 --> 02:25:43,186
A human being should
not feel so sad.

877
02:25:56,700 --> 02:25:58,853
You were in a great hurry.

878
02:26:02,020 --> 02:26:09,000
No man could have
endured so much.

879
02:26:13,000 --> 02:26:17,160
You were in a great haste.

880
02:26:17,200 --> 02:26:20,000
And I was late in my sacrifice.
881
02:26:21:200 --> 02:26:24,700
But you will come back again.
