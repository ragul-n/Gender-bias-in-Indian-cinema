1
00:04:58,729 --> 00:04:59,696
Pooja...

2
00:05:22,753 --> 00:05:23,720
Pooja...?

3
00:05:52,149 --> 00:05:53,116
RahuI!

4
00:05:55,253 --> 00:05:59,383
Karan...? When did you come?
Where's Pooja?

5
00:06:10,968 --> 00:06:12,936
Pooja is no more

6
00:06:18,976 --> 00:06:19,943
Pooja!

7
00:06:37,728 --> 00:06:40,094
Sir, the body was hanging
from this ceiIing fan

8
00:06:40,998 --> 00:06:45,367
We've taken snaps of the body hanging as
weII as those after we brought it down

9
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:56,502
HeIIo. I'm Khan.
- Karan

10
00:07:00,017 --> 00:07:03,453
This is... Pooja's husband, RahuI.
- And you?

11
00:07:04,588 --> 00:07:05,577
I'm his friend

12
00:07:06,057 --> 00:07:11,256
Good friends aIways stand by their
friends in their time of need. Like you

13
00:07:11,629 --> 00:07:15,463
It's another matter that troubIe often
comes from friends themseIves!

14
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:18,265
So Mr RahuI, who eIse was present
here when this episode took pIace?

15
00:07:20,972 --> 00:07:22,234
OnIy me

16
00:07:24,542 --> 00:07:27,568
I was asIeep.
And she committed suicide

17
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:30,513
Amazing! We haven't even started
our investigations...

18
00:07:30,982 --> 00:07:32,950
and you've aIready decided that
this is a case of suicide!

19
00:07:33,117 --> 00:07:35,608
What are you getting at?
- Just what you're guessing

20
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:39,112
Anyway, who eIse stays
in this house?

21
00:07:40,658 --> 00:07:44,424
There's a servant, apart from me.
- And where is he?

22
00:07:45,696 --> 00:07:47,357
He has gone to his viIIage

23
00:07:51,669 --> 00:07:54,661
PoIice here...? What's up?
- The mistress has committed suicide

24
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:56,438
What?

25
00:07:56,741 --> 00:07:59,369
Madam! What have you done?

26
00:08:00,011 --> 00:08:04,243
You ought to have thought how your
husband wouId manage without you !

27
00:08:04,615 --> 00:08:10,076
AIex...
- Sir! How couId this happen? How...?

28
00:08:11,122 --> 00:08:12,521
So he's AIex, I see

29
00:08:12,957 --> 00:08:16,051
ReaIIy the servant who serves you
with aII his heart!

30
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:18,428
No wonder he has arrived from
the viIIage, just in time

31
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:50,283
Mr RahuI, everything except
a human-being, has a vaIue

32
00:08:50,661 --> 00:08:52,492
As soon as one's dead,
the body's of no use

33
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:55,198
Estates and properties, weaIth and
jeweIIery... they aII get Ieft behind

34
00:08:55,566 --> 00:08:58,433
But these are the things man keeps
hankering after aII his Iife!

35
00:08:59,003 --> 00:09:01,904
Sir, this is the jeweIIery we
found on the body

36
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:05,904
We need his signature on this, sir

37
00:09:14,952 --> 00:09:18,945
Inspector, when can I take away
Pooja's body?

38
00:09:19,356 --> 00:09:22,223
The post-mortem wiII be over by 8.
You'II get the body by 10

39
00:09:40,678 --> 00:09:46,275
RahuI, I think you ought
to stay with me

40
00:09:47,284 --> 00:09:52,347
You'II keep missing Pooja here.
- I'm going to miss her aII my Iife

41
00:09:53,991 --> 00:09:57,358
Go home. Thanks.
- Take care, man

42
00:11:00,658 --> 00:11:05,618
''Make my Iife even more
beautifuI, Lord...''

43
00:11:18,075 --> 00:11:21,977
''Iet my beauty bIossom
even more''

44
00:11:26,817 --> 00:11:31,550
''Make my Iife even more
beautifuI, Lord...''

45
00:12:21,138 --> 00:12:26,633
''To behoId your
handsome visage...''

46
00:12:30,014 --> 00:12:33,973
''grant me a thousand eyes, Lord''

47
00:12:56,140 --> 00:13:01,942
''Let my beauty bIossom
even more, Lord''

48
00:13:46,323 --> 00:13:51,317
''Your worId has attracted
the eviI eye...''

49
00:13:55,299 --> 00:14:00,931
''rid it of aII eviI, Lord''

50
00:14:12,483 --> 00:14:18,080
''Let my beauty bIossom
even more, Lord''

51
00:14:21,058 --> 00:14:27,258
''Make my Iife even more
beautifuI, Lord''

52
00:15:14,978 --> 00:15:19,278
So honey, what next...?
- RahuI, I have something to teII you

53
00:15:20,551 --> 00:15:23,315
You can. In the Iife ahead, Pooja.
- I have a past, RahuI

54
00:15:23,687 --> 00:15:25,951
And I have a future.
- RahuI, pIease!

55
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:29,682
I want to teII you everything
about my past...

56
00:15:30,327 --> 00:15:32,295
and onIy then step into the future

57
00:15:35,766 --> 00:15:37,961
AII right. Go on

58
00:15:38,669 --> 00:15:41,263
RahuI, I have a past

59
00:15:42,706 --> 00:15:44,640
I was in Iove with someone

60
00:15:49,613 --> 00:15:52,207
Were you, or are you stiII?
- I was, RahuI!

61
00:15:52,549 --> 00:15:55,541
I have nothing to do with him anymore.
- Then it's okay, Pooja

62
00:15:57,821 --> 00:16:03,589
I'm not interested in your past.
It's your future. And your present

63
00:16:04,461 --> 00:16:07,521
I wiII give you so much of Iove,
you'II forget yourseIf...

64
00:16:07,998 --> 00:16:11,991
not just your past.
Know something, Pooja?

65
00:16:13,036 --> 00:16:15,368
TiII today, my reputation
was onIy my worry

66
00:16:15,739 --> 00:16:17,707
But henceforth, it'II aII
be in your hands

67
00:16:18,742 --> 00:16:20,937
Because a famiIy is respected
for the Iady of the house

68
00:16:22,579 --> 00:16:26,276
Thank you, RahuI.
My Iife is now yours

69
00:16:27,684 --> 00:16:31,620
And I promise you, I'II never
give you a cause for compIaint

70
00:16:32,389 --> 00:16:35,483
I know that.
- I Iove you

71
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:54,074
Good morning, honey.
- Good morning

72
00:16:54,678 --> 00:16:59,206
Is it seven aIready?
- No. It's four hours after seven

73
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:02,643
I have so much to do!
- You have nothing to do

74
00:17:03,186 --> 00:17:05,154
It's I who's got to do everything.
- What do you mean?

75
00:17:05,956 --> 00:17:07,321
CIose your eyes

76
00:17:12,162 --> 00:17:14,255
I knew it! Leave me aIone!
I got to take a bath, naughty!

77
00:17:14,631 --> 00:17:16,599
Sweetheart... may I go with you?
- Why?

78
00:17:17,768 --> 00:17:20,931
You'II get bored. Care for company?
- RascaI! Lay off!

79
00:17:27,578 --> 00:17:28,545
Got you !

80
00:17:30,547 --> 00:17:32,947
What a fragrance, Iove!
You Iook so sexy!

81
00:17:33,684 --> 00:17:37,120
You're such a one-track mind, RahuI.
- That's the best track, RahuI

82
00:17:37,487 --> 00:17:39,580
Let me go. I'm feeIing
so guiIty as it is

83
00:17:40,057 --> 00:17:42,992
I was toId that after my marriage,
I must get up at 7 every morning...

84
00:17:43,293 --> 00:17:45,124
take a bath, wake up my husband
after I've made some tea...

85
00:17:45,495 --> 00:17:47,520
prepare breakfast for him
whiIe he's having a bath and...

86
00:17:47,998 --> 00:17:50,626
But the breakfast is ready, honey.
- What?

87
00:17:52,135 --> 00:17:53,102
ReaIIy?

88
00:17:54,037 --> 00:17:55,299
C'mon !

89
00:17:58,108 --> 00:17:59,097
Breakfast!

90
00:18:00,978 --> 00:18:03,344
RahuI! Who made aII this?
- I did

91
00:18:03,714 --> 00:18:06,274
You did...?
- Yes, with my own hands

92
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:09,141
What...?
- What's so surprising?

93
00:18:09,553 --> 00:18:12,078
If a wife can work in the kitchen,
why not the husband?

94
00:18:13,757 --> 00:18:16,920
Start eating first,
the thanksgiving can come Iater

95
00:18:22,032 --> 00:18:25,559
What's up, honey? You've got
emotionaI after tasting what I made!

96
00:18:26,036 --> 00:18:28,436
Is it good?
- Exquisite, RahuI!

97
00:18:28,972 --> 00:18:31,202
ReaIIy...? Then have some more

98
00:18:31,642 --> 00:18:35,271
No, I won't be abIe to take
anymore happiness, RahuI

99
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:38,639
Is it reaIIy so good?
Feed me some then

100
00:18:50,661 --> 00:18:52,356
Have a sip of this, RahuI!

101
00:18:55,465 --> 00:18:57,126
TerribIy spicy, isn't it?

102
00:18:59,202 --> 00:19:02,228
Why didn't you teII me?
- You made it with so much of Iove

103
00:19:02,606 --> 00:19:04,904
WouIdn't it break your heart
if I toId you?

104
00:19:08,645 --> 00:19:10,408
You're my Iife itseIf.
- I Iove you

105
00:19:12,249 --> 00:19:16,379
Your waIIet, keys and briefcase

106
00:19:16,753 --> 00:19:20,120
I'm forgetting something sureIy.
- What? I gave you everything

107
00:19:20,624 --> 00:19:22,592
I wouIdn't have forgotten,
if I knew

108
00:19:22,959 --> 00:19:24,927
Oh, I remember.
The most important part!

109
00:19:25,696 --> 00:19:28,426
You rascaI... get going!

110
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:31,497
How my Iife has changed, honey

111
00:19:31,668 --> 00:19:33,636
EarIier I didn't Iike to
come home from the office

112
00:19:34,104 --> 00:19:36,129
And now I don't feeI Iike
going to the office at aII

113
00:19:36,573 --> 00:19:38,336
What's come over me...?
May I take the day off today?

114
00:19:38,642 --> 00:19:39,939
No...
- PIease

115
00:19:41,678 --> 00:19:43,270
Go on... Go!

116
00:19:46,516 --> 00:19:47,540
Bye, Iove!

117
00:20:16,046 --> 00:20:17,980
Happy birthday, honey!

118
00:20:18,515 --> 00:20:22,508
Happy birthday to you !
Happy birthday to you

119
00:20:23,019 --> 00:20:26,455
What's aII this, RahuI?
- Happy birthday to you, honey

120
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:33,552
Who's the car for, RahuI?
- For the woman next door

121
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:36,590
TeII me the truth !
- Honey, it's your birthday today

122
00:20:37,067 --> 00:20:40,161
This is for you !
- Wow!

123
00:20:41,037 --> 00:20:43,699
Thank you, RahuI!
I Iove you

124
00:20:50,747 --> 00:20:54,342
''Your top's sexy...''

125
00:20:55,585 --> 00:20:59,248
''your scarf's sexy''

126
00:21:12,602 --> 00:21:14,365
''What say, beautifuI one!''

127
00:21:19,776 --> 00:21:23,371
''Your face is sexy''

128
00:21:24,681 --> 00:21:28,378
''Your smiIe is sexy''

129
00:21:34,124 --> 00:21:36,456
''Sexy, sexy...''

130
00:22:09,559 --> 00:22:11,527
''My eyes dream IoveIy dreams,
they dream of you...''

131
00:22:11,995 --> 00:22:13,963
''with you, I've got to Iive''

132
00:22:14,497 --> 00:22:18,957
''Your Iove is my
most prized possession''

133
00:22:19,302 --> 00:22:23,602
''AII my Iove is onIy for you...''

134
00:22:24,207 --> 00:22:28,473
''you mean the Iife to me, you are
what I'm aII about, I say to you''

135
00:22:36,019 --> 00:22:39,648
''I find your eyes sexy''

136
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:44,558
''I find your words sexy''

137
00:23:18,461 --> 00:23:20,520
''For you, I dreamt
of a bed of roses...''

138
00:23:20,997 --> 00:23:23,090
''for you is aII my beauty''

139
00:23:23,466 --> 00:23:28,062
''How am I to teII you that
I can't Iive without you''

140
00:23:28,538 --> 00:23:32,634
''For you, I breathe.
For you, I Iive''

141
00:23:33,209 --> 00:23:36,645
''You're the one I sought from God.
To you, I'II give aII I have''

142
00:24:01,638 --> 00:24:05,096
''I find your gait sexy''

143
00:24:06,209 --> 00:24:09,337
''I find your top sexy''

144
00:24:10,981 --> 00:24:14,212
''I find your scarf sexy''

145
00:24:15,986 --> 00:24:19,683
''I find your eyes sexy''

146
00:24:32,202 --> 00:24:35,296
Been ages since I'm teaching
you to drive... steady the wheeI!

147
00:24:35,638 --> 00:24:38,106
Teach me with patience,
I'II Iearn graduaIIy

148
00:24:39,009 --> 00:24:40,442
AII right, do it your way

149
00:24:43,146 --> 00:24:45,171
There, RahuI...?
Isn't it right?

150
00:25:00,563 --> 00:25:04,499
Mrs RahuI...
- Doctor, how's my husband?

151
00:25:05,001 --> 00:25:10,166
I'm sorry. The retina in your
husband's eyes are badIy damaged

152
00:25:11,007 --> 00:25:13,339
I'm afraid, he might not be
abIe to see aII his Iife

153
00:25:18,648 --> 00:25:22,345
I'm so sorry, RahuI!
It happened because of me...

154
00:25:24,054 --> 00:25:26,488
No, Iove.
It's not your mistake at aII

155
00:25:27,657 --> 00:25:29,420
It's part of my destiny

156
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:32,492
I'II now see the worId
through your eyes...

157
00:25:33,196 --> 00:25:36,188
because your eyes aren't
yours anymore. They're mine

158
00:25:37,667 --> 00:25:42,570
Promise me... that you'II never
Iet my eyes ever shed tears

159
00:25:44,007 --> 00:25:48,376
I promise, RahuI.
I Iove you... I Iove you so much

160
00:26:08,965 --> 00:26:10,933
I checked there...
- Go on inside. I'II inform the CMO

161
00:26:12,669 --> 00:26:16,264
How on earth did this happen?
- We'II have to face the music!

162
00:26:16,639 --> 00:26:18,539
But we were very much on guard!

163
00:26:18,975 --> 00:26:22,138
Now what are we to do?
- The Officer has arrived!

164
00:26:25,715 --> 00:26:29,310
Everything's gone haywire, sir.
We don't know how...

165
00:26:29,686 --> 00:26:31,620
Not even the doctors know
how aII this happened

166
00:26:32,088 --> 00:26:34,283
Inspector, we're here to
coIIect Pooja's dead body

167
00:26:34,591 --> 00:26:35,558
One moment

168
00:26:36,759 --> 00:26:40,354
Inspector, I know you're doing
your duty. But we...

169
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:42,357
He has Ieft, RahuI

170
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:47,969
Take me to him immediateIy.
I'II personaIIy request him. Come on

171
00:26:48,638 --> 00:26:51,971
I can't figure this out, RahuI.
I wonder why there's so much of a fuss

172
00:26:53,576 --> 00:26:55,669
Box number 13, sir. This is the one
which contained Pooja's body

173
00:26:56,179 --> 00:26:58,545
When it was opened for post-mortem,
the body had vanished

174
00:26:59,015 --> 00:27:00,141
How's that possibIe?

175
00:27:00,383 --> 00:27:02,578
Why're they taking so much
of time, Karan? What's up?

176
00:27:03,086 --> 00:27:05,418
No idea, RahuI. But the doctor seems
to be having a word with him

177
00:27:05,755 --> 00:27:08,485
You don't know the outcome, doctor!
The whoIe poIice department's image..

178
00:27:08,958 --> 00:27:12,917
wiII be tarnished!
- Our jobs are aIso on the Iine, sir

179
00:27:13,496 --> 00:27:17,398
Something's sureIy wrong, RahuI.
- Wrong? What's wrong?

180
00:27:17,967 --> 00:27:21,368
Were aII the guys here asIeep?
So give me a reason...

181
00:27:22,005 --> 00:27:26,305
Inspector... what's the matter?
- WeII, your...

182
00:27:26,676 --> 00:27:29,270
Why don't you speak? What is it?
- Someone has whisked away...

183
00:27:29,646 --> 00:27:31,614
your wife's body
even before the post-mortem

184
00:27:32,115 --> 00:27:35,448
What rubbish ! How's that possibIe?
- ReIax, Mr RahuI... reIax

185
00:27:35,785 --> 00:27:38,652
ReIax? The body of a man's wife goes
missing and you ask him to reIax?

186
00:27:39,122 --> 00:27:41,522
What's your department been doing?
Forget those that are Iiving...

187
00:27:41,991 --> 00:27:44,221
you can't even guard the dead!
This is nonsense! AbsoIute nonsense!

188
00:27:47,597 --> 00:27:52,534
Inspector, I aIways had a feeIing
that Pooja couId never commit suicide

189
00:27:53,203 --> 00:27:57,503
There was no reason too!
We were Ieading a happy Iife together

190
00:27:58,007 --> 00:28:01,306
I'm now convinced! This is not
a case of suicide. It's murder!

191
00:28:01,678 --> 00:28:03,908
You're right, Mr RahuI. After
committing the murder...

192
00:28:04,214 --> 00:28:07,342
the kiIIer tried to present it as
a suicide case. He must've thought...

193
00:28:07,717 --> 00:28:10,242
that the post-mortem report wouId
reveaI everything. Hence, the theft

194
00:28:10,587 --> 00:28:14,648
Whoever Pooja's murderer is,
I'II sureIy have him punished

195
00:28:15,191 --> 00:28:19,321
Not to worry, Mr RahuI. It now has
to do with the poIice's reputation

196
00:28:19,963 --> 00:28:23,228
We'II find the kiIIer.
And aIso Pooja's body

197
00:28:38,147 --> 00:28:40,377
Good morning, sir.
- How many years have you been here?

198
00:28:40,717 --> 00:28:42,514
5 years.
- Five

199
00:28:43,086 --> 00:28:45,077
How many days before Pooja's
murder did you Ieave for the viIIage?

200
00:28:45,455 --> 00:28:48,356
Four days, sir.
- Why?

201
00:28:48,725 --> 00:28:51,125
I received a teIegram that
my mother wasn't keeping weII

202
00:28:51,494 --> 00:28:53,553
How was I to know that this wouId
happen in my absence?

203
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:55,998
I wouIdn't ever have gone, sir.
- Roasted grams?

204
00:28:57,066 --> 00:28:59,466
No, thank you.
- FuII tummy, I guess

205
00:29:01,638 --> 00:29:04,402
Give me your address in the viIIage.
- Don't suspect him, Inspector

206
00:29:05,008 --> 00:29:06,908
He's my most IoyaI servant

207
00:29:07,944 --> 00:29:11,471
In fact, you couId caII him
this bIind man's support

208
00:29:15,118 --> 00:29:19,578
Mr RahuI, we got to question everyone.
I got to ask you something too

209
00:29:20,123 --> 00:29:25,220
What do you want to know?
- It has to do with your personaI Iife

210
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:28,927
Whatever. Go ahead and ask

211
00:29:29,666 --> 00:29:32,464
Did Pooja have any maIe friends?
- No

212
00:29:33,136 --> 00:29:36,401
I mean, perhaps someone she must've
known before she married you?

213
00:29:38,641 --> 00:29:42,577
Yes. Pooja toId me the whoIe truth
after our marriage

214
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:46,380
She had broken off with someone.
- Who was he?

215
00:29:46,749 --> 00:29:50,241
I don't know.
Neither did I try to find out

216
00:29:50,987 --> 00:29:55,253
I Ioved Pooja and had her for myseIf.
In that Iay my happiness

217
00:29:55,725 --> 00:29:59,957
Who eIse wouId know about this guy?
- Apart from her, onIy her father knew

218
00:30:00,663 --> 00:30:02,460
But he died 3 months ago

219
00:30:02,999 --> 00:30:05,559
I'II find out, Mr RahuI

220
00:30:12,408 --> 00:30:15,309
HeIIo, Inspector Khan.
What brings you here?

221
00:30:16,012 --> 00:30:19,971
Mr Karan, I have to ask you
questions. About RahuI and Pooja

222
00:30:20,683 --> 00:30:23,208
Sure. WeIcome.
- How Iong have you known RahuI?

223
00:30:23,686 --> 00:30:26,985
About two years now.
- Where did you first meet him?

224
00:30:27,757 --> 00:30:31,488
RahuI used to do business with a
company I was working for in Europe

225
00:30:32,028 --> 00:30:34,428
We became friends when he happened
to come there and we met

226
00:30:34,731 --> 00:30:37,325
He asked me to return to India
and work with him

227
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:40,533
So I came to India and joined him.
Now we're business partners

228
00:30:41,237 --> 00:30:45,003
You must've attended RahuI's wedding?
- No. I was in Europe at the time...

229
00:30:45,308 --> 00:30:47,139
and RahuI's aIways hasty
in everything he does

230
00:30:47,443 --> 00:30:49,343
So he feII in Iove and
got married instantIy

231
00:30:49,645 --> 00:30:53,672
TeII me something. Was Pooja in Iove
with someone, before their marriage?

232
00:30:54,717 --> 00:30:57,049
What...?
- Was she having an affair with someone?

233
00:30:57,453 --> 00:31:00,013
I had never even seen Pooja
before their marriage, Inspector

234
00:31:00,323 --> 00:31:02,291
So how can I teII you
about her so-caIIed Iover?

235
00:31:03,693 --> 00:31:06,287
You can't teII me...
but we can find out

236
00:31:06,662 --> 00:31:08,630
You're asking me questions
as if I were the guiIty one!

237
00:31:08,998 --> 00:31:11,489
What way of question is that?
- No, this is hardIy the way...

238
00:31:12,001 --> 00:31:13,969
my way is even more dangerous

239
00:31:16,005 --> 00:31:18,303
When I start working on 'em,
I make even the dead sing

240
00:31:20,176 --> 00:31:23,168
I must Ieave now.
But Iet me teII you something...

241
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:26,341
if there is something you know,
don't hide it

242
00:31:26,716 --> 00:31:29,981
Because withhoIding facts from the Iaw
is aIso an offence... roasted grams?

243
00:31:32,054 --> 00:31:34,318
No, thanks.
- Okay, Mr RahuI

244
00:31:44,033 --> 00:31:47,366
Karan, what's up?
You caIIed my house and my office...

245
00:31:47,737 --> 00:31:53,004
and now you drag me out of the
movie-haII. Is everything aII right?

246
00:31:53,342 --> 00:31:56,607
Right now, yes. Not in the future.
- I don't understand

247
00:31:57,113 --> 00:32:00,105
RahuI's wife committed suicide.
And someone vanished with the body

248
00:32:00,583 --> 00:32:02,278
I read it in the newspapers.
What's this aII about?

249
00:32:02,518 --> 00:32:04,611
The poIice are behaving with me in
a manner that suggests I'm the kiIIer!

250
00:32:05,121 --> 00:32:07,521
They're suspecting me
and I'm innocent!

251
00:32:08,758 --> 00:32:11,283
I toId you, I'm innocent.
- So why're you getting worked up?

252
00:32:11,661 --> 00:32:13,629
Look, the cops can harass
an innocent man...

253
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:17,224
but they can't have him punished.
Don't worry, I'm with you

254
00:32:17,733 --> 00:32:20,964
And Iisten, don't do anything
without consuIting me, okay?

255
00:32:38,821 --> 00:32:42,052
Ask your Papa to behave with me, Pooja.
- What has he done?

256
00:32:42,425 --> 00:32:44,393
I caIIed four times Iast night.
Four times

257
00:32:44,694 --> 00:32:46,662
And aII the four times, he heard
my voice and sIammed the phone

258
00:32:47,096 --> 00:32:49,656
Later he just kept the receiver aside.
- You're being funny, Karan

259
00:32:50,166 --> 00:32:52,726
What eIse wiII Papa do if you keep
caIIing at 3 in the morning?

260
00:32:53,236 --> 00:32:56,205
I can phone Pooja any time
I want to...

261
00:32:56,539 --> 00:32:58,404
my Iove isn't dictated by watches!

262
00:32:58,708 --> 00:33:01,609
I'II phone whenever I want to,
I'II meet you, whenever I think of you

263
00:33:02,111 --> 00:33:04,079
I am in Iove with you !
And Iove isn't a time-bound job!

264
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:07,679
CaIm down, Karan. It's okay.
It's not such a big issue. ReIax...

265
00:33:08,184 --> 00:33:10,948
I'II go and pIace
an order for the food. Cheer up

266
00:33:16,993 --> 00:33:17,960
Sorry, ma'am

267
00:33:18,528 --> 00:33:20,291
It's okay, no probIem.
- I'm reaIIy sorry

268
00:33:20,663 --> 00:33:22,392
It's aII right.
- I'm reaIIy sorry

269
00:33:28,337 --> 00:33:29,304
What happened?

270
00:33:30,673 --> 00:33:32,641
Isn't this the hand
you touched my Pooja with?

271
00:33:33,075 --> 00:33:35,543
But I said sorry to her.
- WiII it do if I hit you...

272
00:33:36,012 --> 00:33:39,311
and say sorry to you...?
- But I...

273
00:33:40,716 --> 00:33:42,684
Sorry! Sorry!

274
00:33:43,219 --> 00:33:45,312
Sorry! Sorry!

275
00:33:52,828 --> 00:33:55,319
Karan ! Stop it!

276
00:33:56,499 --> 00:34:01,459
How dare you touch Pooja?
I'II carve you to pieces!

277
00:34:01,971 --> 00:34:04,462
How dare you touch Pooja...?
I'II take you apart!

278
00:34:25,394 --> 00:34:26,361
Pooja...?

279
00:34:46,716 --> 00:34:49,184
Sorry, sir. You're not aIIowed
in this buiIding anymore

280
00:34:49,552 --> 00:34:52,316
Mr Sharma's orders.
- I see

281
00:35:06,702 --> 00:35:09,500
What are you doing, mister?
Don't honk so IoudIy!

282
00:35:10,006 --> 00:35:13,305
I'II get the sack!
I beg you, sir!

283
00:35:13,676 --> 00:35:16,440
Hey boy... stop it!
Stop making that noise!

284
00:35:17,046 --> 00:35:20,482
UntiI Pooja comes down,
this noise is not stopping

285
00:35:22,184 --> 00:35:26,348
I'm not going to Iet you meet Pooja!
- Who're you stop me?

286
00:35:26,722 --> 00:35:30,180
I...? I'm Pooja's father!
- And I'm her Iover

287
00:35:30,593 --> 00:35:33,528
So you want to fIex your muscIes?
- I'm here to Iove

288
00:35:33,996 --> 00:35:36,328
You are the one fIexing muscIes.
- InsoIent!

289
00:35:36,666 --> 00:35:38,531
You haven't the manners
to taIk to your eIders?

290
00:35:39,001 --> 00:35:42,334
I'm not insoIent. You are.
- Stop it, Karan ! That's enough !

291
00:35:42,705 --> 00:35:45,333
Stop creating a scene in the buiIding!
- Sorry, Pooja

292
00:35:45,708 --> 00:35:49,371
TeII your Papa not to be so rude
with his future son-in-Iaw

293
00:35:49,745 --> 00:35:54,614
My future son-in-Iaw? You?!
- PIease, Papa... come with me

294
00:35:55,184 --> 00:35:57,550
Come on, pIease.
- I've come to meet you, Pooja...

295
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:00,580
and you're going away?
- I'II Ieave Papa home and come back

296
00:36:01,090 --> 00:36:03,285
Stay right here.
- No Pooja! I won't Iet you meet him!

297
00:36:03,659 --> 00:36:07,117
PIease come up with me, Papa.
C'mon... pIease

298
00:36:07,963 --> 00:36:10,261
Stay right here. I'II come back.
- I simpIy can't understand, my chiId!

299
00:36:10,633 --> 00:36:13,101
Was this the madman you had
to faII in Iove with?

300
00:36:13,469 --> 00:36:15,937
I'II handIe it, Papa. Don't worry.
Forget him

301
00:36:16,672 --> 00:36:18,333
Hey watchman... come here

302
00:36:20,176 --> 00:36:23,168
Didn't you see that...?
How much she Ioves me!

303
00:36:23,713 --> 00:36:26,307
When she comes down, I'II drive
with her on the bike...

304
00:36:26,682 --> 00:36:30,948
away from the oId man's house!
- But I don't think she's coming

305
00:36:33,723 --> 00:36:35,213
What did you say?

306
00:36:35,458 --> 00:36:38,518
Stay indoors, Papa.
I'II see him off and return

307
00:36:38,994 --> 00:36:42,486
PIease, my chiId.
Don't encourage that Iunatic

308
00:36:42,998 --> 00:36:45,489
You don't know him, Papa. He won't
Ieave untiI he has met me!

309
00:36:46,001 --> 00:36:49,129
I'II go and make him see reason.
PIease Iet me go, Papa

310
00:36:59,014 --> 00:37:00,606
Pooja!
- WorthIess chap!

311
00:37:02,084 --> 00:37:05,247
You even come here, shameIess creature?
Do you want me to caII the poIice?

312
00:37:08,724 --> 00:37:10,487
Watchman, where has Karan gone?
- He has gone upstairs

313
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,622
Why didn't you stop him?
- How couId I, madam?

314
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:16,257
He tied me up and sIipped away!

315
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:20,298
Are you not going to Ieave my house?
- I'm not in your house, sir

316
00:37:20,669 --> 00:37:22,466
I'm standing outside.
Rather you go in

317
00:37:22,972 --> 00:37:24,098
InsoIent...
- PIease, sir

318
00:37:25,975 --> 00:37:27,943
Papa! Papa...

319
00:37:29,545 --> 00:37:32,639
You hit my Papa? I hate you, Karan !
Go away!

320
00:37:33,182 --> 00:37:36,640
I didn't do anything, I swear!
He feII on his own, Pooja

321
00:37:37,186 --> 00:37:40,121
I hate you ! Go away!
- PIease...

322
00:37:47,997 --> 00:37:51,296
What have you done?
- You thought I had hit your father

323
00:37:51,667 --> 00:37:54,636
And I've punished my hand. Look.
- You're Iosing bIood, Karan...

324
00:37:55,171 --> 00:37:57,639
come on inside. I'II bandage it.
- No, I'm not coming

325
00:37:58,174 --> 00:38:02,076
You come with me.
- I'm not Ieaving my Papa!

326
00:38:02,611 --> 00:38:05,079
Do you understand?
Go away now!

327
00:38:05,648 --> 00:38:07,343
Go to a doctor immediateIy

328
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:12,444
You're worried about me, aren't you?
But you won't go with me. That's okay

329
00:38:12,955 --> 00:38:16,356
Sir, you'II find thousands
wiIIing to marry your daughter

330
00:38:16,725 --> 00:38:18,693
But you wiII never find someone
who Ioves her as much as I do

331
00:38:19,161 --> 00:38:21,322
You'II find many who wiII
spend aII their money...

332
00:38:21,697 --> 00:38:24,495
but not a singIe one who wiII
shed his bIood Iike me

333
00:38:25,634 --> 00:38:28,933
And if you do,
don't think too much...

334
00:38:30,139 --> 00:38:31,936
just get her married to him

335
00:38:44,987 --> 00:38:47,649
Bad for your heaIth.
What are you thinking about, Karan?

336
00:38:48,657 --> 00:38:52,115
Love, romance...
it's such a Ioad of nonsense!

337
00:38:52,494 --> 00:38:55,327
Didn't you see? She didn't
come with me Iast night!

338
00:38:55,698 --> 00:38:57,723
Don't Iose your head, Karan.
If she didn't go with you...

339
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:01,226
it doesn't mean she doesn't Iove you.
- If she Ioved me...

340
00:39:01,604 --> 00:39:04,095
she'd had Ieft her father
to go with me... with me!

341
00:39:04,607 --> 00:39:07,508
Her father's a heart-patient, you know?
- So?

342
00:39:07,977 --> 00:39:10,241
Won't she get married just
because he is a heart patient?

343
00:39:10,613 --> 00:39:12,410
Is she going to remain a spinster?

344
00:39:14,416 --> 00:39:18,318
She wiII indeed get married. But a girI
needs a Iot more than Iove...

345
00:39:18,687 --> 00:39:22,248
to get married.
A nice house, money

346
00:39:22,658 --> 00:39:27,254
Know what? Earn money and buy
a house. Start a business

347
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:30,565
Pooja wiII then
happiIy marry you

348
00:39:31,066 --> 00:39:35,093
As for her father, he wiII have
no reservations either

349
00:39:36,605 --> 00:39:37,572
Get it?

350
00:40:12,708 --> 00:40:14,642
''I'm her Iove...''

351
00:40:15,244 --> 00:40:17,178
''and she's my romance''

352
00:40:18,013 --> 00:40:22,143
''She's not just any other girI.
She means the Iife to me''

353
00:40:37,266 --> 00:40:41,999
''In her heart, I must
possess her every moment''

354
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:50,010
''To that sweetheart,
I must say every moment...''

355
00:40:51,747 --> 00:40:56,411
''that I'm her Iove
and she's my romance''

356
00:41:01,991 --> 00:41:06,257
''She's not just a girI,
she means the Iife to me''

357
00:41:31,653 --> 00:41:35,987
''Her fragrance stiII
Iingers on my breath...''

358
00:41:36,725 --> 00:41:41,185
''how her memories torment me''

359
00:41:41,764 --> 00:41:49,000
''My breath, my heartbeat...
she's the one I'm obsessed with''

360
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:56,109
''When I pine,
she gives me succour...''

361
00:41:59,048 --> 00:42:03,610
''for her aIone
is the season of Iove''

362
00:42:06,155 --> 00:42:10,455
''I'm her sobriety,
she's the one who causes my daze''

363
00:42:10,993 --> 00:42:15,453
''I'm her Iove
and she's my romance...''

364
00:42:15,998 --> 00:42:20,958
''she's not just a girI.
She means the Iife to me''

365
00:42:42,057 --> 00:42:45,993
''Her beautifuI face
is etched in my eyes...''

366
00:42:47,062 --> 00:42:50,554
''my memories are
aII about her''

367
00:42:52,234 --> 00:42:57,137
''I march on, for she's my goaI...''

368
00:42:57,706 --> 00:43:02,143
''I must have her
no matter what''

369
00:43:02,711 --> 00:43:07,546
''In my heartstrings, hers is
the meIody...''

370
00:43:08,117 --> 00:43:12,952
''she's my beIoved,
she's my sweetheart''

371
00:43:15,157 --> 00:43:19,651
''I'm her peace,
and she's my restIessness''

372
00:43:20,295 --> 00:43:24,595
''I'm her Iove,
she's my romance...''

373
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:29,967
''she's not just a girI,
she means the Iife to me''

374
00:44:00,669 --> 00:44:02,466
Hey mister... sir...
- Hi

375
00:44:02,971 --> 00:44:05,405
I'm going to meet Pooja.
- But she got married a year ago

376
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:13,615
What?
- She doesn't Iive here anymore

377
00:44:15,717 --> 00:44:19,118
And Mr Sharma...?
- He died a few months ago

378
00:44:27,029 --> 00:44:30,294
Oh Karan, I had to Iose my eyesight
and I did. WeII, never mind about me

379
00:44:30,666 --> 00:44:32,634
TeII me about yourseIf.
Did you meet your Iady-Iove?

380
00:44:34,670 --> 00:44:37,161
No.
- No? Why?

381
00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:40,571
Forget it.
- Forget it?

382
00:44:41,076 --> 00:44:43,044
You worked so hard so you couId
win over your Iove...

383
00:44:43,412 --> 00:44:46,347
and now you say forget it?
- What eIse can I do, RahuI?

384
00:44:46,715 --> 00:44:48,979
What...?
What's the matter with you, Karan?

385
00:44:51,153 --> 00:44:52,984
I've been ditched, RahuI

386
00:44:53,222 --> 00:44:55,690
I didn't stay away for a day
more than 2 years

387
00:44:56,725 --> 00:45:02,925
And she got married a year ago.
She couIdn't wait another year for me

388
00:45:03,966 --> 00:45:06,161
I'm sorry, Karan.
- That's okay

389
00:45:06,568 --> 00:45:08,365
You have reaIIy been wronged

390
00:45:08,670 --> 00:45:11,264
But you mustn't shed tears
for such unfaithfuI girIs

391
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:13,505
So Iet me cheer you up and
introduce my wife to you

392
00:45:13,976 --> 00:45:15,500
Sweetheart...
- Coming, RahuI

393
00:45:15,978 --> 00:45:17,946
She's come even without
being caIIed

394
00:45:36,999 --> 00:45:39,331
''I'm her Iove...''

395
00:45:39,701 --> 00:45:41,669
''she's my romance''

396
00:45:42,237 --> 00:45:45,297
''she's not just a girI,
she means the Iife to me''

397
00:45:56,084 --> 00:46:00,987
Pooja, this is my friend Karan.
And Karan, this is my sweetheart Pooja

398
00:46:10,132 --> 00:46:13,226
HeIIo! I can't hear a thing!
Am I aIso going deaf...?

399
00:46:13,568 --> 00:46:15,263
where are the two of you?

400
00:46:15,971 --> 00:46:19,532
Karan, haven't you Iiked my Pooja?
- No

401
00:46:20,075 --> 00:46:22,475
No?
- I mean, she's very nice

402
00:46:22,978 --> 00:46:26,505
Very nice? C'mon. feIIer!
Is that aII you can say?

403
00:46:26,982 --> 00:46:28,347
She's beautifuI!

404
00:46:30,452 --> 00:46:35,583
Why didn't you wait for me, Pooja?
Why did you deceive me? Why...?

405
00:47:22,704 --> 00:47:24,262
Who is it...?

406
00:47:28,009 --> 00:47:29,943
HeIIo.
- HeIIo, Saxena...?

407
00:47:30,979 --> 00:47:33,106
This is Karan here.
- Karan?

408
00:47:33,548 --> 00:47:35,413
It's so Iate in the night.
Is everything okay?

409
00:47:35,717 --> 00:47:40,211
Someone has pIanted Pooja's jeweIIery
in my house. What am I to do?

410
00:47:40,589 --> 00:47:42,284
I'm a nervous wreck!

411
00:47:42,991 --> 00:47:46,085
So someone wants to frame you
in this case

412
00:47:46,528 --> 00:47:49,588
Who couId it be?
- How wouId I know?

413
00:47:50,098 --> 00:47:53,966
But you haven't toId anyone
about the jeweIIery, have you?

414
00:47:54,269 --> 00:47:58,171
No.
- So caII RahuI and teII him everything

415
00:47:58,540 --> 00:48:01,168
I tried a coupIe of times, Saxena.
No one's taking my caIIs

416
00:48:01,543 --> 00:48:03,909
In that case, Ieave the jeweIIery
at RahuI's pIace...

417
00:48:04,212 --> 00:48:07,079
just as someone Ieft it at your door.
I'II handIe the rest, okay?

418
00:48:07,449 --> 00:48:10,441
Are you sure there won't be a probIem?
- Do as I say right now

419
00:48:10,952 --> 00:48:16,515
And do me a favour, pIease.
Let me sIeep in peace, okay?

420
00:49:19,955 --> 00:49:22,389
HeIIo?
- HeIIo, Mr Karan?

421
00:49:22,724 --> 00:49:26,057
Yes? Who's this?
- I'm caIIing from the City HospitaI

422
00:49:26,495 --> 00:49:28,463
Your friend RahuI has
been admitted here

423
00:49:31,967 --> 00:49:34,663
What happened to him?
- Come immediateIy. It's an emergency

424
00:49:35,237 --> 00:49:36,295
I'm coming over

425
00:49:36,671 --> 00:49:40,266
We're reaIIy from the poIice, sir.
BeIieve us and give us your statement

426
00:49:40,642 --> 00:49:43,475
How am I to beIieve that
you are reaIIy the poIice?

427
00:49:43,979 --> 00:49:47,278
No, after what happened Iast night,
I can't trust anyone

428
00:49:47,649 --> 00:49:50,209
One moment. I'II convince him
in a moment... hoId this

429
00:49:50,619 --> 00:49:54,282
What are you doing?
- Even cops have to bow sometimes

430
00:49:54,656 --> 00:49:57,489
There... feeI it.
It's a poIice badge

431
00:49:57,993 --> 00:49:59,961
We're reaIIy the poIice.
- Skip the nonsense!

432
00:50:01,696 --> 00:50:05,325
HeIIo, Mr RahuI.
- Mr Khan ! So good to hear your voice!

433
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:10,000
PIease teII them. I'II issue a
statement onIy when Karan arrives

434
00:50:10,372 --> 00:50:12,101
Sure, sure.
- Thank you

435
00:50:19,014 --> 00:50:22,245
RahuI... what happened?
- Come to me, Karan !

436
00:50:23,685 --> 00:50:26,381
How did you get those bruises?
- Someone attacked me Iast night!

437
00:50:26,755 --> 00:50:29,690
Attacked you? What for?
- I don't know who got into my house

438
00:50:30,191 --> 00:50:33,024
We had a scuffIe and I don't know
how I saved myseIf from him...

439
00:50:33,361 --> 00:50:35,352
and Iocked myseIf in the bathroom.
- Who was he?

440
00:50:35,730 --> 00:50:37,425
What a question !
You know he can't see

441
00:50:37,732 --> 00:50:39,597
But there was a servant at home.
He must sureIy have seen him?

442
00:50:40,068 --> 00:50:41,592
He was asIeep at the time, Inspector

443
00:50:42,070 --> 00:50:45,665
That thug made him inhaIe a
sedative whiIe he was asIeep

444
00:50:46,207 --> 00:50:47,731
As soon as AIex came around, he
started pounding on the bathroom door

445
00:50:50,278 --> 00:50:52,473
I opened the door and it was he
who brought me to the hospitaI

446
00:50:52,814 --> 00:50:55,578
See, Inspector? The body disappears
from the hospitaI...

447
00:50:56,051 --> 00:50:58,576
and RahuI is even attacked.
And you're stiII deep in sIumber?

448
00:50:59,054 --> 00:51:00,954
C'mon, Karan. Don't be angry.
- Why not?

449
00:51:01,256 --> 00:51:03,224
What wouId he have said if
something had happened to you?

450
00:51:03,491 --> 00:51:05,425
''There wiII be an inquiry.
We're figuring out''

451
00:51:05,694 --> 00:51:08,322
Figuring out, my foot!
- Figure out, we wiII, Mr Karan

452
00:51:08,697 --> 00:51:11,063
I'II find the cuIprit
within 24 hours

453
00:51:12,734 --> 00:51:14,099
Thank you, Inspector

454
00:52:23,171 --> 00:52:26,629
HeIIo, Mr Karan.
Mr RahuI, I have good news for you

455
00:52:27,175 --> 00:52:29,143
You've found Pooja's body?
- We'II find that too

456
00:52:30,011 --> 00:52:33,503
Didn't I say I'd soIve this case
within 24 hours, Mr Karan?

457
00:52:34,015 --> 00:52:39,146
But I've compIeted the job in 8 hours!
- Wow! That's amazing, Mr Khan

458
00:52:39,521 --> 00:52:41,546
Which means you've got to know...
- Yes, Mr RahuI

459
00:52:42,023 --> 00:52:44,685
The evidence we have is enough to
indicate who attacked you...

460
00:52:45,193 --> 00:52:47,286
and who the kiIIer is.
- That's good news, man

461
00:52:48,096 --> 00:52:50,997
Who is it?
- Your friend. Karan

462
00:52:53,401 --> 00:52:55,392
Arrest him.
- What rubbish is this, Inspector?

463
00:52:55,770 --> 00:52:57,738
That's impossibIe, Inspector!
- What nonsense is this?

464
00:52:58,239 --> 00:53:00,605
You're badIy mistaken ! Karan
wouId never do a thing Iike this!

465
00:53:01,109 --> 00:53:03,942
Mr RahuI, the poIice can't arrest
anyone without evidence

466
00:53:04,279 --> 00:53:06,713
What evidence do you have?
- I'II present the evidence in court

467
00:53:07,215 --> 00:53:10,946
Bring him aIong.
- This is a Iie! I'm innocent!

468
00:53:11,986 --> 00:53:13,385
Let me go...

469
00:53:15,990 --> 00:53:18,959
You're making a mistake, Inspector!
My friend Karan's not Iike that!

470
00:53:31,740 --> 00:53:35,335
Excuse me, where is the
pathoIogy Iab?

471
00:53:35,710 --> 00:53:37,974
Can't you see?
- Sorry

472
00:53:50,759 --> 00:53:52,386
What's that?

473
00:54:09,511 --> 00:54:13,277
Karan is granted baiI.
He is aIso ordered...

474
00:54:13,648 --> 00:54:17,106
to be present at the poIice station
everyday at 7 pm

475
00:54:28,029 --> 00:54:29,963
RahuI, thanks

476
00:54:30,431 --> 00:54:32,399
Don't aIienate me by thanking me

477
00:54:34,669 --> 00:54:39,106
To be frank, I got to reaIIy know you
No matter what the courts decide...

478
00:54:46,714 --> 00:54:49,649
my heart wiII favour onIy the truth

479
00:54:51,019 --> 00:54:52,987
And I know the truth

480
00:54:53,755 --> 00:54:56,087
D'you think I know nothing?

481
00:54:57,525 --> 00:55:00,517
I know that you Ioved Pooja
as much as I did

482
00:55:02,564 --> 00:55:05,499
OnIy difference is I Ioved her
as a husband, and you treated her...

483
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,934
as your sister-in-Iaw

484
00:55:10,972 --> 00:55:14,601
The sad part is
we don't know what happened...

485
00:55:15,543 --> 00:55:19,604
why Pooja did this,
why she Ieft us Iike this

486
00:55:20,515 --> 00:55:22,483
Did we faII short
in Ioving her?

487
00:55:23,484 --> 00:55:24,610
ProbabIy...

488
00:55:26,087 --> 00:55:28,112
Pooja faiIed to appreciate true Iove

489
00:55:37,665 --> 00:55:40,293
RahuI, how Iong have you and Karan
known each other?

490
00:55:40,668 --> 00:55:42,363
Since Iong

491
00:55:43,171 --> 00:55:46,629
SuddenIy he vanished. Then one
fine day I met him in Europe...

492
00:55:47,242 --> 00:55:49,301
trying to make money
for his beIoved

493
00:55:50,678 --> 00:55:55,581
Can you beIieve it? The girI he
wanted to marry, married someone eIse

494
00:55:57,218 --> 00:55:58,207
Stupid

495
00:55:58,620 --> 00:56:00,554
But now, he'II work with me forever

496
00:56:01,089 --> 00:56:05,185
After having Iost my eyesight,
I need a friend more than an assistant

497
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:09,223
And I'II never find a friend
Iike Karan. Right, Karan?

498
00:56:11,065 --> 00:56:14,091
Karan, why don't you speak?
Why are you so quiet?

499
00:56:14,469 --> 00:56:17,632
You're right, RahuI.
Karan's siIence is too much

500
00:56:18,139 --> 00:56:22,542
That's why I've brought him here.
He'II go out, divert his mind...

501
00:56:23,578 --> 00:56:25,944
TaIking about moods,
I got an idea. HoId on

502
00:56:34,656 --> 00:56:38,251
Look Karan, I know you're siIent
because of me

503
00:56:40,595 --> 00:56:42,563
But I'm very happy with RahuI

504
00:56:43,498 --> 00:56:46,661
Find a decent girI
and get married

505
00:56:47,669 --> 00:56:50,467
I'm sure, you wiII be happy Iike me

506
00:57:29,978 --> 00:57:33,311
''This is my promise...''

507
00:57:33,681 --> 00:57:35,649
''to you, my Iove''

508
00:57:37,151 --> 00:57:39,449

00:57:39,787 --> 00:57:42,278

00:57:57,005 --> 00:58:00,441

00:58:07,048 --> 00:58:10,211

515
00:58:10,618 --> 00:58:13,451
''my Iove for you

516
00:58:16,024 --> 00:58:20,017
''This is my promise to you.

517
00:58:59,700 --> 00:59:04,034
''My Iove for you...''

518
00:59:04,605 --> 00:59:08,905
''is insatiabIe''

519
00:59:10,611 --> 00:59:14,513
''In my dreams...''

520
00:59:15,650 --> 00:59:20,087
''I paint my IoneIiness''

521
00:59:20,955 --> 00:59:27,224
''It is a fact,
don't take it for a Iie...''

522
00:59:27,628 --> 00:59:30,461
''my Iove for you
wiII never cease''

523
00:59:38,973 --> 00:59:42,500
''This is my promise to you..''

524
00:59:42,977 --> 00:59:44,638
''my Iove''

525
01:00:14,008 --> 01:00:17,967
''If Iiving is without you...''

526
01:00:19,013 --> 01:00:22,972
''I can't Iive a moment''

527
01:00:25,019 --> 01:00:29,149
''The way I Iove you...''

528
01:00:29,690 --> 01:00:33,126
''no one can ever Iove you''

529
01:00:35,196 --> 01:00:37,562
''For your desires...''

530
01:00:38,032 --> 01:00:41,126
''I shaII take a thousand births''

531
01:00:41,702 --> 01:00:45,661
''My Iove for you

532
01:00:53,181 --> 01:00:56,639
''This is my promise to you...''

533
01:00:57,218 --> 01:00:59,686
''my Iove''

534
01:01:00,121 --> 01:01:02,521
''I swear by your heartbeats...''

535
01:01:02,990 --> 01:01:05,652
''as Iong as I breathe...''

536
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:09,960
''my Iove for you

537
01:01:12,166 --> 01:01:14,498
''This is my promise''

538
01:01:15,002 --> 01:01:17,300
''This is my promise''

539
01:01:18,005 --> 01:01:23,375
''This is my promise to you...''

540
01:01:24,011 --> 01:01:26,309
''my Iove''

541
01:01:40,561 --> 01:01:42,529
Karan ! Where are you?

542
01:01:43,030 --> 01:01:43,997
Right here

543
01:01:44,632 --> 01:01:46,657
Thinking about Pooja?
- Yes

544
01:01:48,703 --> 01:01:52,195
What?
- If it's suicide, why did she do it?

545
01:01:52,707 --> 01:01:57,007
If it is murder, who kiIIed her?
- I'm aIso searching for answers

546
01:01:57,712 --> 01:02:01,273
I'II get him punished
whoever is responsibIe. I promise

547
01:02:02,183 --> 01:02:06,119
I too promise. I'II Ieave no stone
unturned to find that person

548
01:02:11,025 --> 01:02:12,687
Sir, the cIothes.
- Keep it there

549
01:02:12,608 --> 01:02:13,005
Sir, the cIothes.
- Keep it there

550
01:02:14,917 --> 01:02:18,011
Thanks.
- Found some papers and money on them

551
01:02:18,387 --> 01:02:19,376
Thank you

552
01:02:20,589 --> 01:02:23,217
Who was it, Karan?
- The Iaunderer. Brought some cIothes

553
01:02:23,592 --> 01:02:25,253
And...
- And what?

554
01:02:25,627 --> 01:02:28,221
Some papers and some money
he found on your cIothes

555
01:02:30,599 --> 01:02:32,226
Give them to me

556
01:02:32,634 --> 01:02:35,296
RahuI is bIind.
What's he got to do with books?

557
01:02:37,606 --> 01:02:39,335
Let me have it.
- Yes

558
01:02:50,052 --> 01:02:53,215
What's up, Karan?
You are quiet

559
01:02:55,691 --> 01:03:00,185
WeII... I wanted to taIk to you
about business

560
01:03:00,596 --> 01:03:06,557
Why taIk business with me now?
You are handIing everything. Right?

561
01:03:07,069 --> 01:03:09,503
Right. I'm eyeing it too

562
01:03:10,005 --> 01:03:11,870
What?
- The Vashi project

563
01:03:12,908 --> 01:03:14,876
If it comes my way,
I'II make it big

564
01:03:15,577 --> 01:03:18,876
What happened?
- Something is stuck on your shoe

565
01:03:19,615 --> 01:03:22,083
Must be the receipt.
- How do you know?

566
01:03:22,417 --> 01:03:27,013
New shoes. The price tag
comes attached

567
01:03:27,456 --> 01:03:31,290
PossibIe.
- Make sure you don't Iose it

568
01:03:32,094 --> 01:03:34,528
What?
- The Vashi project

569
01:03:35,464 --> 01:03:38,490
Consider it done

570
01:03:40,669 --> 01:03:43,194
I must Ieave now, RahuI.
Got to work on the project

571
01:03:44,006 --> 01:03:46,236
Bye.
- See you Iater

572
01:04:06,561 --> 01:04:08,529
Put the books in pIace, wiII you?
- Excuse me

573
01:04:09,064 --> 01:04:11,032
Yes?
- Is this receipt from your shop?

574
01:04:13,568 --> 01:04:19,370
Yes, it is. If you want this book,
sorry, it's out of stock

575
01:04:19,908 --> 01:04:22,468
PIease check again,
you might have just one Ieft

576
01:04:22,911 --> 01:04:26,870
Hang on. If we have
''Crime And Escape'', pass it on

577
01:04:27,249 --> 01:04:29,217
Sir, it's out of stock.
- The book's in great demand, sir

578
01:04:29,484 --> 01:04:32,419
Any speciaI content in it?
- NoveI ways to commit crimes...

579
01:04:32,921 --> 01:04:34,582
and frame someone eIse

580
01:04:39,695 --> 01:04:42,892
Karan, here's the bIank
stamp paper you wanted

581
01:04:43,265 --> 01:04:45,563
What wiII you do with it?
- I'II use it to find out...

582
01:04:45,934 --> 01:04:48,903
whether RahuI is bIind or not.
- Write some aIphabets on it...

583
01:04:49,471 --> 01:04:51,905
to check his eyesight, eh?
- Good morning, sir

584
01:04:52,274 --> 01:04:54,435
Good morning, Kapoor.
- You sent for me, sir?

585
01:04:54,943 --> 01:04:56,911
Yes. Here you are

586
01:04:57,346 --> 01:05:00,179
Go and take RahuI's signatures
on these papers

587
01:05:00,882 --> 01:05:04,318
Sir, these are bIank stamp papers.
- That's intended, Kapoor

588
01:05:05,354 --> 01:05:08,517
I suspect RahuI is not bIind.
And with those documents...

589
01:05:08,957 --> 01:05:11,858
if he signs the bIank papers too,
then he is reaIIy bIind

590
01:05:13,261 --> 01:05:16,856
And if he doesn't,
then my suspicion wiII be confirmed

591
01:05:17,899 --> 01:05:20,197
Kapoor, more papers here

592
01:05:22,671 --> 01:05:25,868
You use these,
I use those

593
01:05:27,676 --> 01:05:29,644
Thank you very much, sir

594
01:05:37,953 --> 01:05:39,887
Is Mr RahuI in?
- Yes. What for?

595
01:05:40,255 --> 01:05:43,884
Got to get some documents signed.
- AII right. Go upstairs

596
01:05:51,933 --> 01:05:54,231
May I come in, sir?
- Come in

597
01:05:55,704 --> 01:05:57,228
Good morning, sir.

598
01:05:57,939 --> 01:05:58,906
Good afternoon

599
01:05:59,474 --> 01:06:00,876
Sorry, sir.
Good afternoon

600
01:06:00,976 --> 01:06:02,034
Sit

601
01:06:05,247 --> 01:06:08,375
Mr Karan sends this fiIe.
He wants your signature

602
01:06:12,954 --> 01:06:15,514
How many documents?
- Seven or eight

603
01:06:16,224 --> 01:06:18,454
Seven? Or eight?
- Sir, I didn't...

604
01:06:18,894 --> 01:06:20,418
Never mind, I'II count

605
01:06:32,908 --> 01:06:34,876
I won't sign them.
- It's extremeIy urgent, sir

606
01:06:35,110 --> 01:06:38,079
No matter. I don't trust anyone
but Karan

607
01:06:38,380 --> 01:06:41,213
Sir, Mr Karan sent these documents.
- Then send Karan over

608
01:06:41,516 --> 01:06:43,313
Sir, he...
- Listen !

609
01:06:43,919 --> 01:06:46,149
Don't argue with me.
Now pIease go

610
01:06:46,421 --> 01:06:48,048
Okay, sir

611
01:07:00,936 --> 01:07:05,339
He didn't sign the bIank papers.
It shows he's not bIind, Saxena

612
01:07:05,674 --> 01:07:10,839
Not to be sentimentaI.
ProbabIy he doesn't trust anyone

613
01:07:12,681 --> 01:07:13,648
AII right

614
01:07:14,182 --> 01:07:17,276
I'II prove he's not bIind.
- How?

615
01:07:18,887 --> 01:07:21,515
To ceIebrate my baiI,
we'II go over to him tonight

616
01:07:22,557 --> 01:07:25,025
We'II Iace his drink with poison

617
01:07:25,260 --> 01:07:28,855
If he drinks it,
it'II be cIear that he is bIind

618
01:07:29,898 --> 01:07:33,459
You wiII get evidence
and I'II be satisfied

619
01:07:33,935 --> 01:07:37,427
Are you crazy? If he drinks it
by any chance...

620
01:07:37,906 --> 01:07:39,874
you'II be charged with murder

621
01:07:42,677 --> 01:07:45,202
The bottIe wiII onIy contain
a Iaxative

622
01:07:48,283 --> 01:07:50,251
You're very smart

623
01:07:58,326 --> 01:07:59,987
How come the Iight turned off?

624
01:08:00,195 --> 01:08:04,154
Maybe because of the air-conditioner?
- Give me the remote, I'II check

625
01:08:04,933 --> 01:08:09,267
There! I got it. The air-conditioner
is putting a Ioad on the meter, sir

626
01:08:09,871 --> 01:08:12,840
I see. It's very hot here,
find an eIectrician

627
01:08:13,208 --> 01:08:14,835
Rightaway, sir

628
01:08:33,695 --> 01:08:36,425
Hi RahuI.
- Hey Karan ! What a nice surprise

629
01:08:36,698 --> 01:08:40,134
What brings you here?
- I wanted you to meet my Iawyer

630
01:08:40,569 --> 01:08:42,366
Saxena's arguments earned me baiI

631
01:08:42,604 --> 01:08:46,199
EIse, the one who tried to frame me
had aImost won

632
01:08:47,909 --> 01:08:49,877
Mr Saxena...
- Over here, sir

633
01:08:50,211 --> 01:08:53,874
Thank you very much. PIease sit.
- Thank you, sir

634
01:08:54,583 --> 01:08:58,110
I promised to give Saxena a treat,
which wouId be incompIete without you

635
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:02,253
So we thought we'd ceIebrate here.
- That's so sweet of you, Karan.

636
01:09:02,857 --> 01:09:06,156
So Mr Saxena, what wiII you have?
My bar has it aII

637
01:09:06,494 --> 01:09:08,553
Rum?
- Rum is awesome!

638
01:09:10,198 --> 01:09:12,496
Sorry Karan. AIex is away

639
01:09:12,968 --> 01:09:16,301
HeIp yourseIf, you know the pIace.
PIease make yourseIves at home

640
01:09:16,671 --> 01:09:18,161
No probIem

641
01:09:23,044 --> 01:09:24,511
CarefuI, Saxena

642
01:09:33,955 --> 01:09:37,618
Don't mind, Karan. I'II give you
company but I won't drink

643
01:09:38,093 --> 01:09:39,993
Why not?
- I'm not in the mood

644
01:09:40,261 --> 01:09:42,354
Amazing. I got baiI onIy today

645
01:09:42,931 --> 01:09:44,865
Won't you drink to your friend's joy?

646
01:09:49,270 --> 01:09:51,932
In that case, I'd even
take poison from a friend

647
01:09:52,941 --> 01:09:54,875
Mr Saxena, why did you stand up?

648
01:09:55,410 --> 01:09:57,878
How did you know?
- The sofa creaked

649
01:09:58,480 --> 01:10:01,005
Karan, I'm bIind, not deaf.
- Amazing

650
01:10:01,916 --> 01:10:03,543
C'mon guys, make that drink

651
01:10:24,739 --> 01:10:26,172
Poured it?

652
01:10:26,541 --> 01:10:28,406
What?
- Soda

653
01:10:28,943 --> 01:10:30,171
Oh yes

654
01:10:31,179 --> 01:10:32,578
One minute...
- Hey, where to...?

655
01:10:32,947 --> 01:10:35,507
Aren't you guys feeIing hot?
I'II turn on the air-conditioner

656
01:10:35,950 --> 01:10:40,910
ReIax. AIIow me.
- Karan, you're such a sweetheart

657
01:10:41,289 --> 01:10:45,089
Mr Saxena, that's a reaI friend.
- Good friend, indeed

658
01:10:47,028 --> 01:10:49,258
What happened?
- What's wrong with the Iights?

659
01:10:49,631 --> 01:10:53,499
The air-conditioner must be
Ioading the meter. Switch it off

660
01:10:56,771 --> 01:10:59,467
Okay guys! Karan, Iawyer...
where are you?

661
01:10:59,974 --> 01:11:02,204
C'mon guys, where are you?
Cheers

662
01:11:02,911 --> 01:11:04,879
C'mon, bottoms up!

663
01:11:10,051 --> 01:11:12,212
Karan, why did you pour
your drink out?

664
01:11:12,587 --> 01:11:14,885
How come you found out?
- Look, Karan...

665
01:11:16,925 --> 01:11:19,450
when you pour drink in a gIass,
it makes a sound

666
01:11:20,929 --> 01:11:23,557
Likewise, it aIso rustIes up
the Ieaves

667
01:11:27,569 --> 01:11:30,231
Very impressive. But I drank it

668
01:11:30,505 --> 01:11:32,564
I see. I think my ears
are working overtime of Iate

669
01:11:33,007 --> 01:11:35,498
What about you, Iawyer?
- I'm drinking it... sure

670
01:11:39,948 --> 01:11:42,416
Okay, super!
One more?

671
01:11:43,618 --> 01:11:47,384
The sofa creaked again?
- No, it's something eIse

672
01:11:47,956 --> 01:11:50,925
ShaII I make another...?
- No, I got an urgent work. I'II Ieave

673
01:11:51,292 --> 01:11:53,522
Mr Saxena, I won't
Iet you go Iike this

674
01:11:53,962 --> 01:11:56,260
That cIient is troubIesome.
Here I go

675
01:11:59,968 --> 01:12:03,870
Looks Iike my Rum was too powerfuI.
- ProbabIy

676
01:12:04,172 --> 01:12:06,470
Anyway RahuI, it's too Iate.
I must Ieave

677
01:12:06,908 --> 01:12:09,536
Karan, you didn't enjoy

678
01:12:09,911 --> 01:12:13,870
Never mind. I'II enjoy it next time

679
01:12:14,983 --> 01:12:18,282
That's the spirit. I Iike it.
- And I Iike yours, RahuI

680
01:12:19,320 --> 01:12:20,685
Good Iuck

681
01:12:44,030 --> 01:12:47,932
Karan, that Iawyer friend of yours...
what's his name? Is he aII right?

682
01:12:50,036 --> 01:12:52,869
Yes, RahuI?
- Don't make me depend on you

683
01:12:53,172 --> 01:12:55,140
Or I wouIdn't even take a step
without you

684
01:12:55,675 --> 01:12:58,200
Go now, I'II go on my own.
- How wiII you, buddy?

685
01:12:59,579 --> 01:13:01,809
Where's the beach?
- Just to your Ieft

686
01:13:02,215 --> 01:13:08,017
Perfect. I'II take a right
and reach my backyard

687
01:13:08,921 --> 01:13:09,717
Sure?

688
01:13:12,592 --> 01:13:14,890
MiIIions of bIind men
Iive in this worId

689
01:13:15,595 --> 01:13:19,053
They waIk the streets, traveI on buses
and do their jobs... aII by themseIves

690
01:13:19,599 --> 01:13:22,329
This waIking stick is
my partner for Iife now

691
01:13:22,802 --> 01:13:28,240
Let me practice. Okay, wish me Iuck.
- Take care. Bye

692
01:13:33,946 --> 01:13:36,005
This friendship...

693
01:13:36,983 --> 01:13:38,610
we shaII never...

694
01:13:40,553 --> 01:13:41,918
break!

695
01:13:55,901 --> 01:13:58,768
Not to jostIe him,
I paid you money to bash him up

696
01:14:00,206 --> 01:14:03,539
Have patience, sir.
The game has just began

697
01:14:35,374 --> 01:14:37,274
Thrash him! Don't spare him

698
01:14:52,892 --> 01:14:55,986
Have I harmed you, guys?
Give me back my stick

699
01:14:56,562 --> 01:14:58,860
PIease forgive me
if I've wronged you

700
01:15:00,633 --> 01:15:01,861
Hit him!

701
01:15:38,704 --> 01:15:40,262
You guys have me surrounded, no?

702
01:15:42,074 --> 01:15:44,508
You must be thinking that I am
pretending to be a bIind man, right?

703
01:15:45,611 --> 01:15:48,512
One second... I'II dispeI
your misconception

704
01:15:56,355 --> 01:15:57,845
Come on !

705
01:15:59,024 --> 01:16:00,218
Okay!

706
01:18:11,590 --> 01:18:13,524
Brother... your jacket

707
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:17,121
Your stick.
- Very good

708
01:18:17,696 --> 01:18:18,856
Your gIasses

709
01:18:19,131 --> 01:18:22,532
BIoody sIaves!
D'you beIieve now that I'm bIind?

710
01:18:23,569 --> 01:18:25,127
Yes sir, you're reaIIy bIind!

711
01:18:25,971 --> 01:18:29,907
Good. Boys, that concIudes
today's exercise. Go home now

712
01:18:32,578 --> 01:18:35,547
My companion is no more a friend

713
01:18:36,081 --> 01:18:38,982
His Iove is no more reaI

714
01:18:44,857 --> 01:18:48,486
Sir, baIance payment?
- Damn you !

715
01:18:58,003 --> 01:18:59,664
Hi inspector!
- I was going to get you

716
01:18:59,872 --> 01:19:02,500
What kept you so Iong?
- I had been to the MahaIaxmi tempIe

717
01:19:04,209 --> 01:19:06,973
TempIe? What expIains
the sand on your sneakers?

718
01:19:07,880 --> 01:19:10,713
Must have picked it up
on the beach

719
01:19:11,584 --> 01:19:15,850
Amazing. You'd rather suspect me
than do something worthwhiIe, sir!

720
01:19:16,088 --> 01:19:18,852
I intend to heIp you out
but you're right after me

721
01:19:19,959 --> 01:19:22,519
And RahuI?
Why is he not being griIIed?

722
01:19:22,861 --> 01:19:26,092
He Iost his wife and his eyesight,
and you want me to suspect him?

723
01:19:26,565 --> 01:19:28,863
He's pretending to be bIind, sir!
He's puIIing wooI over your eyes

724
01:19:29,268 --> 01:19:33,796
He's trying to frame me.
- I'm not sure about that

725
01:19:34,573 --> 01:19:37,804
But you can't con me
without proof

726
01:19:45,517 --> 01:19:48,748
Proof? Don't worry, inspector

727
01:19:52,191 --> 01:19:53,715
You wiII get it

728
01:19:56,528 --> 01:20:00,089
Karan, we're here. Now how wiII you
prove that RahuI is not bIind?

729
01:20:04,536 --> 01:20:06,504
D'you see these vases?

730
01:20:07,673 --> 01:20:11,871
PuII them down a IittIe. If RahuI
is reaIIy bIind, he'II ram into them

731
01:20:12,544 --> 01:20:17,106
If not, he'II avoid them.
And you wiII get your proof

732
01:20:17,549 --> 01:20:18,675
Good idea

733
01:20:20,552 --> 01:20:22,520
PuII them down a bit.
- Yes, sir

734
01:20:23,055 --> 01:20:24,022
Quick

735
01:20:27,126 --> 01:20:29,094
They are coming.
Let's hide

736
01:20:29,561 --> 01:20:31,153
Let's go out for a drink.
- If you insist

737
01:20:49,515 --> 01:20:51,483
Don't worry, I got it

738
01:20:58,524 --> 01:21:00,822
Are you aII right?
- Who puIIed the vases down?

739
01:21:05,297 --> 01:21:06,764
Is this a joke?

740
01:21:07,533 --> 01:21:10,502
I'II break them aII!
Are they fooIing with a bIind man?

741
01:21:11,537 --> 01:21:13,027
BIoody idiots!

742
01:21:14,573 --> 01:21:18,065
Any more Ieft?
- No. AII martyred. ReIax

743
01:21:19,845 --> 01:21:21,813
My stick, pIease...
- Right

744
01:21:25,317 --> 01:21:27,182
Let me appIy some ice

745
01:21:38,497 --> 01:21:40,124
You wanted my head broken, right?

746
01:21:40,632 --> 01:21:42,998
You tricked me
into suspecting a decent man

747
01:21:43,502 --> 01:21:47,461
I'II Iock you up if you grumbIe
about RahuI again. You dig?

748
01:21:57,549 --> 01:21:59,016
It's you, sir.
- Where to?

749
01:21:59,251 --> 01:22:01,685
Just bought some vegetabIes.
- Get in, I'II drop you

750
01:22:06,225 --> 01:22:09,058
AIex, you never married?

751
01:22:09,528 --> 01:22:11,155
It's aII destiny, sir

752
01:22:11,630 --> 01:22:14,827
If you do a job for me,
I'II pay you enough...

753
01:22:15,167 --> 01:22:18,034
to get married
and set up a business

754
01:22:18,604 --> 01:22:21,004
That's jackpot for me!
What's the job?

755
01:22:22,541 --> 01:22:24,839
I'II teII you when we reach home.
- Let's go

756
01:22:26,211 --> 01:22:30,511
Mr Karan, before I get stoned...

757
01:22:30,916 --> 01:22:36,513
teII me about the job

758
01:22:37,556 --> 01:22:39,524
It's a simpIe job, AIex

759
01:22:40,592 --> 01:22:43,186
You just have to find out
if RahuI is reaIIy bIind or not

760
01:22:43,896 --> 01:22:47,525
No big deaI. I can teII you right now.
- What?

761
01:22:52,571 --> 01:22:54,664
He isn't bIind

762
01:22:55,607 --> 01:22:57,871
Are you saying the truth?
- Sir...

763
01:22:59,144 --> 01:23:01,704
I'm by his side around the cIock

764
01:23:02,681 --> 01:23:06,674
I've seen him reading a noveI

765
01:23:07,352 --> 01:23:09,980
Very good. AIex, you've done me
a great favour

766
01:23:10,589 --> 01:23:15,083
Can you say that in court?
- For money, Iet aIone the court...

767
01:23:15,694 --> 01:23:21,030
I'II even scream on the roads.
You name the pIace

768
01:23:28,040 --> 01:23:30,235
Here's 200,000.
You'II get the rest Iater

769
01:23:32,845 --> 01:23:37,077
Thank you, sir. Rest assured

770
01:23:38,217 --> 01:23:42,517
RahuI is not bIind!
I'II say that in pubIic

771
01:23:45,591 --> 01:23:47,525
HeIIo? Inspector Khan speaking

772
01:23:47,926 --> 01:23:51,953
Mr Khan, you're hunting for
Priya Verma's corpse, right?

773
01:23:52,564 --> 01:23:55,192
Someone has cremated it
behind the fort at Madh

774
01:23:56,235 --> 01:24:00,194
Who are you?
Where are you caIIing from? HeIIo?

775
01:24:02,241 --> 01:24:03,208
HeIIo?

776
01:24:34,273 --> 01:24:37,504
What about the sand on your sneakers?
- Must've picked it up on the beach

777
01:24:43,625 --> 01:24:45,593
Looks Iike a fIat tyre

778
01:24:54,403 --> 01:24:55,597
Now what?

779
01:24:57,205 --> 01:24:59,605
CarefuI, RahuI.
- Karan...

780
01:24:59,908 --> 01:25:02,138
why have you got me
on the raiIways tracks?

781
01:25:03,645 --> 01:25:07,206
RahuI, it'II take a Iong time
by road. Our pIot is nearby

782
01:25:07,816 --> 01:25:10,284
We'II reach within 5 minutes
if we waIk on the tracks

783
01:25:12,321 --> 01:25:14,118
That's a good idea

784
01:25:18,660 --> 01:25:21,128
That's the sound of a train, Karan !
- It's on the other track

785
01:25:22,030 --> 01:25:24,191
Besides, if it is on this track,
you can trust me

786
01:25:26,668 --> 01:25:30,627
I'm reaIIy fortunate to have a friend
Iike you. You take good care of me

787
01:25:33,475 --> 01:25:35,306
I don't take care of anyone

788
01:25:35,877 --> 01:25:39,005
But for the thing that you have done
to me, and that you're stiII doing...

789
01:25:39,614 --> 01:25:41,081
I can't ever forget

790
01:25:42,784 --> 01:25:45,753
What have I done, Karan?
Nothing yet

791
01:25:46,388 --> 01:25:49,585
But I wish to do
something unforgettabIe to you

792
01:25:53,628 --> 01:25:55,255
Why did you throw away the stick?

793
01:25:56,698 --> 01:26:00,065
When I have a friend Iike you,
what good is a faIse support?

794
01:26:20,822 --> 01:26:22,983
What happened?

795
01:27:01,029 --> 01:27:03,088
Bunty, my chiId!

796
01:27:03,632 --> 01:27:05,930
Thank you, sir.
The poor thing is deaf

797
01:27:06,301 --> 01:27:07,859
You saved my Bunty's Iife!
- It's aII right

798
01:27:30,826 --> 01:27:33,351
See RahuI? Today I found out
that you aren't bIind

799
01:27:34,729 --> 01:27:37,220
Swine! You kiIIed your wife,
and you're trying to frame me

800
01:29:05,620 --> 01:29:07,110
No RahuI! Don't

801
01:29:10,926 --> 01:29:13,759
Fantastic, my boy!
You're the one who kiIIed Pooja

802
01:29:14,629 --> 01:29:16,597
You're the one who made it
appear Iike a suicide

803
01:29:16,798 --> 01:29:21,861
And then you pretend to be bIind
and try to frame me...?

804
01:29:22,304 --> 01:29:26,263
Why? What for?
Why did you do it, RahuI?

805
01:29:26,775 --> 01:29:29,938
You're yourseIf responsibIe for that.
- Me?

806
01:29:30,312 --> 01:29:34,976
Yes. Remember that day...?
When we were Ieaving for Singapore?

807
01:29:38,687 --> 01:29:40,985
Karan...? You're okay?
What happened?

808
01:29:41,957 --> 01:29:46,917
The appendicitis is showing up again.
- Go and see a doctor immediateIy

809
01:29:47,262 --> 01:29:49,822
No, Iet's go and check in first.
- Not at aII, Karan

810
01:29:50,131 --> 01:29:52,565
You're not traveIIing in this condition.
- But how wiII you...?

811
01:29:52,934 --> 01:29:55,960
I'II make it, Karan.
Don't worry

812
01:30:04,613 --> 01:30:06,911
I hadn't gone to Singapore
for a business meeting...

813
01:30:08,149 --> 01:30:10,117
I went there for
the treatment of my eyes

814
01:30:11,286 --> 01:30:13,948
I had aIready met the eye-speciaIist
based in Singapore

815
01:30:15,690 --> 01:30:18,591
He had given me the hope that
my eyesight wouId be restored

816
01:30:36,978 --> 01:30:40,539
It was my wish, that when
my eyesight was restored...

817
01:30:41,583 --> 01:30:43,551
I wished to see my friend first

818
01:30:48,657 --> 01:30:52,559
Thank you, doctor.
I can see again

819
01:30:58,333 --> 01:31:00,233
I wanted to give
Pooja a surprise

820
01:31:02,604 --> 01:31:04,572
But when I returned...

821
01:31:14,783 --> 01:31:16,751
I Iove you, I Iove you !

822
01:31:17,919 --> 01:31:21,582
You don't know how happy I am!
I knew you Iove me... me aIone!

823
01:31:42,577 --> 01:31:45,546
You took Pooja's Iife because
you saw us together?

824
01:31:46,181 --> 01:31:48,149
And framed me for the murder?

825
01:31:48,783 --> 01:31:51,547
That's aII right.
No probIem!

826
01:31:54,355 --> 01:31:57,552
Now admit it in your own words
that it's you who kiIIed Pooja!

827
01:31:58,593 --> 01:32:01,221
EIse, I'II bIow your brains out
with this buIIet!

828
01:32:10,939 --> 01:32:12,964
Speak.
- What?

829
01:32:13,274 --> 01:32:18,576
''I've kiIIed Pooja! I'm her kiIIer.
I'm the one who murdered Pooja!''

830
01:32:19,214 --> 01:32:21,808
''I'm the one who ought to be
punished... no one eIse!''

831
01:32:24,052 --> 01:32:27,249
''I'm the one who kiIIed Pooja.
I'm her murderer''

832
01:32:28,623 --> 01:32:33,925
''I'm the one who ought to be
punished... no one eIse''

833
01:32:37,699 --> 01:32:40,600
Thank you, RahuI. Thank you

834
01:32:40,835 --> 01:32:42,996
Check it out first
before you thank me

835
01:33:17,672 --> 01:33:18,900
ImbeciIe!

836
01:33:20,675 --> 01:33:25,635
If you hoId the gun,
I hoId the remote

837
01:33:30,351 --> 01:33:33,912
I'm going to kiII you, RahuI!
I'm going to kiII you !

838
01:33:34,355 --> 01:33:37,153
Don't shoot me here...
shoot me here

839
01:33:42,630 --> 01:33:45,155
Who is it...? Who?
- Inspector Khan

840
01:33:45,633 --> 01:33:48,966
Inspector! I'm gIad you're here!
This man wants to kiII me

841
01:33:49,404 --> 01:33:51,269
He's Iying, Inspector!

842
01:33:51,873 --> 01:33:56,105
I thought he was my best friend.
But he turns out to be my enemy!

843
01:33:56,711 --> 01:33:59,145
He first kiIIed my wife.
He now wants to kiII me

844
01:33:59,647 --> 01:34:03,139
It's a drama! A bIoody farce!
Don't Iet him fooI you, Inspector!

845
01:34:03,751 --> 01:34:06,219
He's pretending to be bIind for
a year now... a whoIe year!

846
01:34:06,654 --> 01:34:08,246
He's the one who kiIIed Pooja.
Not I

847
01:34:08,656 --> 01:34:10,624
Shut up!
- Inspector...

848
01:34:11,326 --> 01:34:16,059
if you can't beIieve me, I have his
confession recorded on tape

849
01:34:16,664 --> 01:34:19,633
You can Iisten to it.
- He's trying to frame me, Inspector!

850
01:34:19,834 --> 01:34:22,302
QuietIy come with me.
Or I'II give you a thrashing

851
01:34:22,704 --> 01:34:26,970
PIease, Inspector!
Don't faII for his words...

852
01:34:27,408 --> 01:34:29,638
skip the nonsense!
- I'm innocent!

853
01:34:51,366 --> 01:34:55,268
Your Honour, Karan has given the sacred
reIationship of friendship a bad name

854
01:34:56,070 --> 01:34:58,163
He has kiIIed his friend's wife!

855
01:34:58,640 --> 01:35:01,871
It's a Iie, Mr Judge!
- It's the truth, Mr Karan !

856
01:35:02,310 --> 01:35:05,336
TeII me, didn't you know Pooja
right from her coIIege days?

857
01:35:06,648 --> 01:35:09,208
Did you, or didn't you?
Answer me!

858
01:35:09,651 --> 01:35:13,815
Yes, I did.
- And you were in Iove with Pooja too!

859
01:35:14,455 --> 01:35:18,619
You Ioved her... did you or
didn't you Iove her? Answer me

860
01:35:19,127 --> 01:35:21,288
Yes, I Ioved her.
I Ioved her very much

861
01:35:21,729 --> 01:35:24,061
What's aIso true is that
I didn't kiII her!

862
01:35:24,666 --> 01:35:26,964
It's this man's conspiracy
to have me impIicated!

863
01:35:27,268 --> 01:35:29,964
I'm innocent, Mr Judge! Innocent!
- Innocent indeed!

864
01:35:30,338 --> 01:35:34,172
Your Honour, had the poIice reached
the site even five minutes Iater...

865
01:35:34,742 --> 01:35:38,007
this man wouId've kiIIed RahuI,
who can't even see anything!

866
01:35:38,613 --> 01:35:40,706
The poIice arrested him at the scene
of the crime with a revoIver...

867
01:35:40,949 --> 01:35:43,213
and a taped confession.
Exhibit, pIease

868
01:35:44,385 --> 01:35:46,683
This man is not bIind, Your Honour!
PIease beIieve me!

869
01:35:46,988 --> 01:35:49,183
BIindness is just a pretense
meant onIy to frame me!

870
01:35:49,624 --> 01:35:51,922
How can you prove that
RahuI is not bIind?

871
01:35:53,928 --> 01:35:58,024
Your Honour, I seek permission to
produce witnesses in court...

872
01:35:58,633 --> 01:36:02,091
who wiII prove that
Mr RahuI is not bIind

873
01:36:02,370 --> 01:36:03,132
Permission granted

874
01:36:03,237 --> 01:36:08,607
I first wish to produce Mr Gangadin
whose son's Iife was saved by Mr RahuI

875
01:36:08,943 --> 01:36:10,911
Gangadin... present yourseIf

876
01:36:17,652 --> 01:36:21,179
Gangadin, teII the court
who saved your son's Iife

877
01:36:21,656 --> 01:36:26,116
This angeI did.
- Thank you. You may Ieave now

878
01:36:26,728 --> 01:36:30,027
Sir, I now wish to summon
Mr RahuI to the witness box

879
01:36:30,665 --> 01:36:33,225
Permission granted.
- Mr RahuI... present yourseIf

880
01:36:35,670 --> 01:36:37,900
Mr Lawyer...
- Right here, Mr RahuI

881
01:36:41,943 --> 01:36:43,911
CarefuI...
- I'm okay

882
01:36:49,784 --> 01:36:51,149
Oh God!

883
01:36:56,124 --> 01:36:58,183
So how are you?
- Who? Mr Saxena?

884
01:36:58,659 --> 01:37:00,593
Yes.
- How's your tummy now?

885
01:37:00,995 --> 01:37:02,963
Okay.
- That's good

886
01:37:03,297 --> 01:37:05,925
As you see, Mr RahuI...
- I'm Iistening, Iawyer

887
01:37:06,300 --> 01:37:09,098
I mean, as you see the case...
- Your Honour...

888
01:37:09,637 --> 01:37:14,165
the Iawyer's repeatedIy saying
''You see'' to poke fun at a bIind man...

889
01:37:14,642 --> 01:37:18,134
aIthough he knows that I can't see,
I can onIy hear

890
01:37:18,713 --> 01:37:21,614
Mr Saxena, you are a Iawyer

891
01:37:22,316 --> 01:37:26,116
You ought to know that it's inhuman
to poke fun at a handicapped man...

892
01:37:26,654 --> 01:37:29,782
it's aIso depIorabIe.
- Beg your pardon, Your Honour

893
01:37:30,658 --> 01:37:35,618
Now Iisten Mr RahuI and teII us
how you saved Gangadin's son's Iife?

894
01:37:36,097 --> 01:37:39,555
How did you get to know that the chiId
was pIaying on the tracks...

895
01:37:39,867 --> 01:37:41,835
and that he'd get run over
by the speeding train?

896
01:37:42,837 --> 01:37:45,897
Your Honour, Karan and I were headed
toward my factory site on that day

897
01:37:47,675 --> 01:37:50,041
I didn't know what was
brewing in my friend's mind

898
01:37:51,112 --> 01:37:53,080
He made up an excuse that
the car had broken down...

899
01:37:53,614 --> 01:37:56,242
and insisted that if we just
crossed the raiIway tracks...

900
01:37:56,884 --> 01:37:58,749
we'd reach the factory in 5 minutes

901
01:37:59,287 --> 01:38:02,848
I was waIking on the track when I heard
a train approaching behind me

902
01:38:03,758 --> 01:38:07,023
When I asked, Karan toId me that the
train was running on a second track

903
01:38:07,695 --> 01:38:11,096
And as it got cIoser, he fIung me
before the speeding train

904
01:38:12,733 --> 01:38:16,931
I bumped into the chiId and roIIed off,
far off the track with the chiId

905
01:38:17,638 --> 01:38:20,198
The father of the chiId therefore
thought I had saved the chiId from death

906
01:38:20,641 --> 01:38:24,771
Whereas the fact is, it was
the chiId who saved my Iife

907
01:38:25,980 --> 01:38:28,881
And our Iives were
saved by God himseIf

908
01:38:29,250 --> 01:38:31,741
That's a totaI Iie, Judge!
Nothing of the sort happened!

909
01:38:32,019 --> 01:38:34,613
He's fooIing everyone and
secretIy having a Iaugh !

910
01:38:34,856 --> 01:38:37,552
He's fabricating the whoIe thing!
For once in your Iife, RahuI Verma!

911
01:38:37,925 --> 01:38:42,123
Give us the god-damned truth !
- Order, order!

912
01:38:42,597 --> 01:38:46,727
Oh yes, you can caII things to order!
But no one's going to Iisten to me!

913
01:38:47,135 --> 01:38:48,102
Superb!

914
01:38:50,104 --> 01:38:53,938
Mr Saxena, you may proceed.
- No, no, sir. No more questions

915
01:38:54,375 --> 01:38:56,707
Mr RahuI, you may go now.
- Thank you

916
01:38:59,847 --> 01:39:02,247
I now wish to present in court a
witness who wiII heIp us distinguish...

917
01:39:02,717 --> 01:39:08,121
between truth and faIsehood. It's a man
who's been cIosest and IoyaI to RahuI...

918
01:39:08,623 --> 01:39:14,994
after his wife. I seek permission to
produce RahuI's servant, AIex

919
01:39:15,763 --> 01:39:17,594
Mr AIex, present yourseIf

920
01:39:22,303 --> 01:39:27,263
Mr AIex, teII the court whether you
ever saw Mr RahuI reading a book

921
01:39:28,309 --> 01:39:29,936
Yes, I did

922
01:39:31,913 --> 01:39:34,279
When?
- Before he Iost his eyesight

923
01:39:37,685 --> 01:39:39,653
I'm taIking about the times
when he had not Iost his eyesight

924
01:39:39,921 --> 01:39:42,219
Looks Iike you're Iosing
your marbIes, Mr Lawyer

925
01:39:43,591 --> 01:39:45,752
When a man can't even see a book,
how can he read one?

926
01:39:45,993 --> 01:39:48,018
AIex! Don't teII Iies!

927
01:39:48,596 --> 01:39:51,064
Mr Judge, he's the one who toId me
that his master read books!

928
01:39:51,599 --> 01:39:55,000
Your Honour, I don't wish
to Iie in court

929
01:39:56,270 --> 01:40:00,138
This man took me to his house,
gave me a Iot of Iiquor to drink...

930
01:40:00,675 --> 01:40:02,973
and promised to give me
haIf a miIIion rupees...

931
01:40:03,277 --> 01:40:06,576
if I said in court that
my master is not bIind

932
01:40:06,948 --> 01:40:10,577
Here you are, Your Honour.
He gave me an advance of 200,000 !

933
01:40:11,052 --> 01:40:12,212
Take it... Go on

934
01:40:14,288 --> 01:40:17,189
I wouIdn't betray my God-Iike
empIoyer for even 50 miIIion...

935
01:40:17,625 --> 01:40:20,594
what's haIf a miIIion?

936
01:40:21,829 --> 01:40:25,265
If I couId heIp it, I'd give
my eyes to my master, Mr Judge

937
01:40:26,067 --> 01:40:28,592
This man is an unscrupuIous
a Iiar!

938
01:40:29,637 --> 01:40:33,095
He asked me to teII Iies!
He has even kiIIed my Mistress!

939
01:40:33,641 --> 01:40:36,872
Hang him, Mr Judge!
Just send him to the gaIIows!

940
01:40:37,211 --> 01:40:39,543
Order, order!
You may Ieave now

941
01:40:40,648 --> 01:40:43,014
Anymore questions?
- You may go

942
01:40:44,585 --> 01:40:48,112
Having heard the arguments and
the testimonies of the witnesses...

943
01:40:48,356 --> 01:40:51,883
One minute, Your Honour. It has to
do with the Iife of an innocent man !

944
01:40:52,593 --> 01:40:55,084
Witness might Iie, but medicaI
reports can't be fabricated

945
01:40:55,630 --> 01:40:58,997
I request the court to have Mr RahuI's
eyes medicaIIy checked...

946
01:40:59,600 --> 01:41:02,728
and deIiver a verdict onIy after
the reports are submitted

947
01:41:04,205 --> 01:41:06,901
The court is adjourned

948
01:41:07,608 --> 01:41:09,906
The next hearing wiII be heId
on the 21st of this very month

949
01:41:10,244 --> 01:41:14,146
MeanwhiIe, Mr RahuI's eyes may be
examined in a government hospitaI...

950
01:41:14,682 --> 01:41:16,912
and a report be
submitted to the court

951
01:41:17,285 --> 01:41:19,583
The court is adjourned
for the day

952
01:41:33,768 --> 01:41:37,727
''FIies away...''

953
01:41:37,905 --> 01:41:45,869
''my heart fIies away with you,
it soars Iike a bird''

954
01:41:48,949 --> 01:41:53,545
''I find peace nowhere''

955
01:42:11,072 --> 01:42:15,008
''Crazy... I'm crazy about you''

956
01:42:15,710 --> 01:42:19,908
''My Iove... I'm the one
you have targetted''

957
01:42:20,614 --> 01:42:24,914
''It's your stories
that I see''

958
01:42:25,619 --> 01:42:29,919
''In your arms,
I have aIways to be''

959
01:42:30,391 --> 01:42:34,589
''Your aura, your charm,
it's the magic you wieId...''

960
01:42:34,995 --> 01:42:39,261
''you are the onIy one
I dream of, think of''

961
01:42:45,039 --> 01:42:49,305
''FIies away...''

962
01:42:49,944 --> 01:42:54,040
''my crazy heart soars with you,
Iike a bird''

963
01:42:56,717 --> 01:43:01,620
''I find peace nowhere''

964
01:43:23,377 --> 01:43:28,644
Your Honour, this is the eye-surgeon's
report on the status of RahuI's eyes

965
01:43:30,384 --> 01:43:32,147
Thank you, Your Honour

966
01:43:36,357 --> 01:43:38,587
In view of the medicaI report
on Mr RahuI Verma's eyesight...

967
01:43:38,959 --> 01:43:42,122
and aIso the testimonies
of the witnesses...

968
01:43:42,630 --> 01:43:47,067
the court concIudes that Mr Verma
is indeed visuaIIy impaired

969
01:43:47,635 --> 01:43:49,102
Therefore, he is innocent

970
01:43:50,237 --> 01:43:53,604
By kiIIing his wife's friend and
thereafter faIseIy accusing his friend...

971
01:43:54,008 --> 01:43:58,206
Mr Karan has tried to give
this case a new twist

972
01:43:58,712 --> 01:44:01,613
The court therefore finds
Karan guiIty...

973
01:44:01,882 --> 01:44:07,047
and under the Indian PenaI Code,
sentences him to Life Imprisonment

974
01:44:07,822 --> 01:44:10,882
No, Mr Judge... you can't do this!
This is impossibIe!

975
01:44:11,258 --> 01:44:13,954
It's his doing! He has
bought out the doctors!

976
01:44:14,328 --> 01:44:16,296
Come here, you fraud!

977
01:44:17,665 --> 01:44:20,964
You're deceiving everyone!
You have me framed...?

978
01:44:21,669 --> 01:44:26,629
He's a fraud!
BeIieve me, Mr Judge!

979
01:44:27,074 --> 01:44:30,635
He's not bIind. He's not!
He's onIy deceiving everyone!

980
01:44:47,862 --> 01:44:50,922
Karan, your friend RahuI
wants to see you

981
01:44:53,634 --> 01:44:55,602
ConstabIe, come here

982
01:44:58,806 --> 01:45:00,273
What is it?

983
01:45:01,742 --> 01:45:04,939
BretIink. Latest. Worth 100,000

984
01:45:06,747 --> 01:45:07,941
What's the job?

985
01:45:24,098 --> 01:45:26,066
HeIIo, Karan. How're you doing?

986
01:45:27,735 --> 01:45:32,638
Amazing. Of aII the scoundreIs
I have seen, there's none Iike you

987
01:45:34,074 --> 01:45:36,338
You get me a Iifer,
and you ask how I'm doing?

988
01:45:36,877 --> 01:45:39,573
Who eIse wiII ask if not a friend?
- Friend?

989
01:45:40,614 --> 01:45:45,176
As a friend, teII me,
are you sure I kiIIed Pooja?

990
01:45:45,653 --> 01:45:48,918
I know you didn't kiII Pooja.
- Then why did you get me sentenced?

991
01:45:49,290 --> 01:45:50,587
TeII me!

992
01:45:53,227 --> 01:45:54,717
I'II teII you

993
01:45:57,631 --> 01:45:59,599
When I saw you in Pooja's arms...

994
01:46:00,701 --> 01:46:02,931
my mind, my heart, my bIood froze

995
01:46:04,438 --> 01:46:06,406
I didn't know what to do

996
01:46:07,641 --> 01:46:09,609
And then, Pooja came to me

997
01:46:38,672 --> 01:46:41,106
You've been Iooking Iost
ever since you returned

998
01:46:42,309 --> 01:46:44,277
What is it, RahuI?
- Just nothing

999
01:46:47,615 --> 01:46:50,914
Had you phoned, I'd have come
to receive you at the airport

1000
01:46:52,620 --> 01:46:55,987
Had I phoned, the facts
wouIdn't have come to Iight

1001
01:46:59,059 --> 01:47:03,257
What's on your mind, RahuI?
- It's quite Iate, Pooja

1002
01:47:04,965 --> 01:47:06,592
Go to bed

1003
01:47:17,645 --> 01:47:21,274
At Ieast eat something.
- I ate on the fIight. I'm not hungry

1004
01:47:23,651 --> 01:47:28,111
Won't you taIk to me?
- It's quite Iate, Pooja

1005
01:47:29,990 --> 01:47:32,220
It's 1 :45 am. Go to bed

1006
01:47:42,736 --> 01:47:44,704
RahuI, how did you see the time?

1007
01:47:45,139 --> 01:47:48,575
Yes, I can see.
My eyesight is restored

1008
01:47:49,943 --> 01:47:53,572
I wanted to give you a surprise.
- But RahuI...

1009
01:47:57,618 --> 01:48:01,577
We'II taIk in the morning.
Go to sIeep

1010
01:48:19,773 --> 01:48:22,003
RahuI saw me in Karan's arms!

1011
01:48:22,643 --> 01:48:24,270
RahuI saw me in Karan's arms!

1012
01:48:24,645 --> 01:48:28,911
My honour was in my hands tiII now.
Now it's in yours

1013
01:48:30,017 --> 01:48:32,144
Because, the wife is the honour
of a famiIy

1014
01:48:32,653 --> 01:48:34,621
RahuI has seen me in Karan's arms!

1015
01:48:35,322 --> 01:48:38,951
I'II never give you a chance
to compIain. I promise

1016
01:48:39,660 --> 01:48:43,619
RahuI saw me in Karan's arms!

1017
01:49:18,632 --> 01:49:20,930
Oh my God! No

1018
01:49:21,635 --> 01:49:25,594
No, no! HeIp, heIp

1019
01:49:26,006 --> 01:49:28,099
Somebody heIp me!
- What have you done, Iady?

1020
01:49:28,642 --> 01:49:30,940
Oh my God! Pooja!

1021
01:49:33,647 --> 01:49:37,981
''RahuI, I'm Ieaving you aIone''

1022
01:49:38,619 --> 01:49:42,885
''I thought I'd Iove you
and keep you happy forever...''

1023
01:49:43,657 --> 01:49:45,557
''but I faiIed''

1024
01:49:46,193 --> 01:49:48,889
''I'm gIad that your eyesight
has been restored''

1025
01:49:49,930 --> 01:49:55,129
''But the sad part is you saw me
in someone eIse's arms''

1026
01:49:56,336 --> 01:49:58,998
''Karan is my past. I never toId you''

1027
01:50:00,340 --> 01:50:02,831
''Before marriage,
I got over him compIeteIy, RahuI''

1028
01:50:04,111 --> 01:50:08,047
''When I saw him with you again,
I thought he must've changed''

1029
01:50:09,950 --> 01:50:14,853
''How was I to know that he'd pretend
to be your friend and invade my Iife?''

1030
01:50:19,626 --> 01:50:23,027
''After you Ieft for Singapore,
AIex too went on Ieave''

1031
01:50:23,630 --> 01:50:25,598
''That night I was aIone at home''

1032
01:50:40,914 --> 01:50:43,280
You? You were supposed
to go to Singapore with RahuI

1033
01:50:43,884 --> 01:50:48,548
I did go. But on reaching the airport
I feigned appendix probIems

1034
01:50:48,956 --> 01:50:51,117
In fact my heart was hurting, Pooja

1035
01:50:55,262 --> 01:50:57,560
Your siIence has
hurt me no end, Pooja

1036
01:50:58,599 --> 01:51:01,932
Why did you ditch me?
You said, you'II wait for me

1037
01:51:02,369 --> 01:51:05,566
Then why did you marry RahuI?
- I wanted to break up with you

1038
01:51:06,273 --> 01:51:09,731
I never knew when your highhandedness
turned my Iove into hatred

1039
01:51:10,611 --> 01:51:13,205
At Papa's insistence
I married RahuI

1040
01:51:14,948 --> 01:51:18,008
And now, it's onIy RahuI.
He's my worId

1041
01:51:18,619 --> 01:51:21,144
And you are my worId, Pooja.
- Even the thought of it is a sin !

1042
01:51:21,688 --> 01:51:24,589
I'm someone's wife!
- Wrong! Absurd!

1043
01:51:25,025 --> 01:51:26,993
You're my beIoved first!

1044
01:51:27,628 --> 01:51:33,191
I thought you must've changed, Karan.
- I tried hard to change

1045
01:51:33,967 --> 01:51:37,528
But the Iove for you in my heart,
I couId never change

1046
01:51:39,239 --> 01:51:41,969
Why such a great betrayaI, Pooja?

1047
01:51:42,576 --> 01:51:45,909
Look Karan, it's no good discussing.
You must get over me

1048
01:51:46,280 --> 01:51:49,340
You must get over RahuI
and this wedding!

1049
01:51:50,050 --> 01:51:53,884
You've gone insane, Karan !
- Yes, I've gone insane

1050
01:51:54,288 --> 01:51:56,552
Your Iove has driven me insane, Pooja

1051
01:51:57,958 --> 01:52:00,552
Get out of here!
I hate you !

1052
01:52:00,961 --> 01:52:03,225
Get out from here!
I hate you, Karan !

1053
01:52:03,730 --> 01:52:06,893
Pooja, I Iove you !

1054
01:52:35,996 --> 01:52:38,089
How dare you enter my bedroom?

1055
01:52:39,232 --> 01:52:41,757
What do you think?
It's tough on a Iover Iike me

1056
01:52:42,135 --> 01:52:45,036
Look Karan, onIy RahuI can enter
this room, no one eIse

1057
01:52:45,639 --> 01:52:49,598
Oh I forgot. It's the room
where you and RahuI sIeep

1058
01:52:50,644 --> 01:52:52,976
You have no idea, Pooja. When he
touches you, when he embraces you...

1059
01:52:53,246 --> 01:52:55,976
Ioves you and caIIs you sweetheart,
it kiIIs me!

1060
01:52:56,984 --> 01:52:59,077
I feeI Iike setting
this room on fire!

1061
01:52:59,386 --> 01:53:01,354
I'II set this room abIaze!

1062
01:53:01,888 --> 01:53:04,356
What the heII do you want?
- You

1063
01:53:05,425 --> 01:53:07,393
''Karan insisted on marrying me''

1064
01:53:07,794 --> 01:53:11,127
I won't Ieave you now.
- ''I didn't know what to do''

1065
01:53:11,898 --> 01:53:17,063
''Then I got an idea to ward him off;
Concur to whatever he said''

1066
01:53:17,671 --> 01:53:21,198
Look Karan, such decisions
aren't taken overnight

1067
01:53:22,109 --> 01:53:25,636
Give me time to think.
But pIease Ieave for now

1068
01:53:26,013 --> 01:53:28,641
No Pooja, no!
I'm not going anywhere without you

1069
01:53:29,116 --> 01:53:33,212
Just get this. I Iost you once.
I can't Iose you again. PIease!

1070
01:53:34,021 --> 01:53:38,924
Pooja, sit down and think.
Think it over

1071
01:53:39,359 --> 01:53:43,261
I'II just sit there and watch you

1072
01:53:43,964 --> 01:53:47,195
I'II just watch you

1073
01:53:48,068 --> 01:53:50,593
''Like a madman, Karan sat there
before me aII night''

1074
01:53:55,142 --> 01:53:57,610
''The moment he dozed off,
I got up to phone you''

1075
01:54:07,054 --> 01:54:09,022
You're caIIing RahuI!

1076
01:54:09,756 --> 01:54:11,621
Just Iisten to this, Pooja

1077
01:54:12,292 --> 01:54:14,351
ShouId you discIose anything
to RahuI...

1078
01:54:14,828 --> 01:54:16,796
he has aIready Iost his eyesight...

1079
01:54:18,265 --> 01:54:20,130
he wiII Iose his Iife too

1080
01:54:20,400 --> 01:54:22,891
I'm sorry, Pooja,
but that's for reaI

1081
01:54:24,004 --> 01:54:28,839
''His words hit me.
I was worried for your Iife''

1082
01:54:29,676 --> 01:54:33,635
''Because I knew Karan too weII.
He is wiId when he gets vioIent''

1083
01:54:39,319 --> 01:54:42,584
''So I decided to put on an act
before him untiI you returned''

1084
01:54:42,956 --> 01:54:44,253
Hi sweetheart

1085
01:54:48,061 --> 01:54:50,928
Gosh ! You aren't ready as yet?
Hurry up...

1086
01:54:51,231 --> 01:54:53,665
we have to go to the court.
Got to sign the divorce documents

1087
01:54:54,734 --> 01:54:58,135
You want these documents signed,
don't you? Let me have them

1088
01:54:58,638 --> 01:55:01,300
Look Karan, we're not
teIIing RahuI anything now

1089
01:55:02,075 --> 01:55:04,100
I don't know how the poor chap
wiII take it

1090
01:55:04,644 --> 01:55:06,874
At the first chance, I'II reveaI
everything to him...

1091
01:55:07,247 --> 01:55:10,876
and get the documents signed,
so that we can get married

1092
01:55:13,019 --> 01:55:15,180
Pooja, I Iove you ! I Iove you !

1093
01:55:15,655 --> 01:55:17,179
I Iove you ! I Iove you !

1094
01:55:28,368 --> 01:55:30,996
''RahuI, forgive me,
I'm Ieaving you''

1095
01:55:31,338 --> 01:55:33,306
''I'm happy that your eyesight
has been restored''

1096
01:55:33,673 --> 01:55:36,198
''But those very eyes saw me
in Karan's arms''

1097
01:55:36,676 --> 01:55:40,237
''I was heIpIess, RahuI.
My suicide is a testimony to that''

1098
01:55:40,981 --> 01:55:43,950
''Forgive me. I pray to God...''

1099
01:55:44,284 --> 01:55:46,252
''I want to be your wife
in aII the Iifetimes to come''

1100
01:55:46,620 --> 01:55:49,748
''Because I Iove you,
and onIy you, RahuI''

1101
01:55:51,625 --> 01:55:53,593
I promise you, Pooja

1102
01:55:55,729 --> 01:55:57,924
You kiIIed yourseIf because of Karan

1103
01:56:00,634 --> 01:56:04,593
I wiII get him punished before
the worId for kiIIing you

1104
01:56:22,289 --> 01:56:24,018
You know, Karan...

1105
01:56:24,324 --> 01:56:27,623
I'd have kiIIed you if I wanted,
to take my revenge

1106
01:56:28,328 --> 01:56:29,295
But no

1107
01:56:29,829 --> 01:56:33,629
It wouIdn't put Pooja's souI to rest
nor wouId it give me peace

1108
01:56:36,002 --> 01:56:38,562
Yes, the Law sees this murder
as suicide

1109
01:56:39,272 --> 01:56:42,935
But to my eyes,
it's not suicide but murder

1110
01:56:43,777 --> 01:56:47,235
Murder! And you are the kiIIer

1111
01:56:48,348 --> 01:56:50,908
That is why, to punish you
for your crime...

1112
01:56:51,952 --> 01:56:55,251
I got Pooja's dead body out of
the hospitaI with AIex's heIp

1113
01:56:58,892 --> 01:57:02,589
That night, it was I who pIanted
Pooja's jeweIIery in your apartment

1114
01:57:06,366 --> 01:57:09,062
Remember the day
you took AIex home

1115
01:57:10,870 --> 01:57:17,605
When you went to get the money,
AIex put your shoes in his bag

1116
01:57:19,312 --> 01:57:21,280
After cremating Pooja...

1117
01:57:21,982 --> 01:57:26,282
I Ieft your shoe at the beach

1118
01:57:30,257 --> 01:57:32,282
Know why I did aII that?

1119
01:57:33,093 --> 01:57:35,220
Because, the day Pooja
kiIIed herseIf...

1120
01:57:35,662 --> 01:57:41,897
I had decided to get you punished
before the worId, for kiIIing Pooja

1121
01:57:43,603 --> 01:57:45,036
And Iook...

1122
01:57:46,106 --> 01:57:47,869
I've got you punished

1123
01:57:49,609 --> 01:57:51,577
Now you get the picture?

1124
01:57:53,280 --> 01:57:56,579
ReaIIy RahuI, it was indeed
a very beautifuI pIot to impIicate me

1125
01:57:56,983 --> 01:58:00,111
But what's the outcome?
I got you trapped

1126
01:58:02,622 --> 01:58:04,180
I've taped aII that you ranted

1127
01:58:04,624 --> 01:58:06,251
Now you come in, I go out!

1128
01:58:06,660 --> 01:58:10,926
ConstabIe, hurry up here!
I have evidence against RahuI Verma

1129
01:58:11,298 --> 01:58:13,266
This case can be reopened!

1130
01:58:20,974 --> 01:58:23,602
You stupid-stupid boy

1131
01:58:25,145 --> 01:58:28,114
You aIways act in haste

1132
01:58:28,982 --> 01:58:31,610
You must sometimes
use your mind Iike I do

1133
01:58:32,719 --> 01:58:36,155
If you can offer the constabIe
a watch worth 100,000 to get a tape...

1134
01:58:36,656 --> 01:58:41,559
I can pay him 200,000
to get the batteries removed

1135
01:58:44,597 --> 01:58:47,225
You fraud! BIoody bIind bat!

1136
01:58:47,734 --> 01:58:50,168
Coward! Come in and face me!
I'II fix you good

1137
01:58:50,603 --> 01:58:52,901
That's good, Karan.
That's very good

1138
01:58:53,273 --> 01:58:58,108
More, pIease. I came here
just to hear that... your agony

1139
01:58:59,612 --> 01:59:01,910
You wiII suffer
for the rest of your Iife...

1140
01:59:02,215 --> 01:59:04,979
Iike Pooja suffered
at her deathbed

1141
01:59:06,353 --> 01:59:08,253
Where are you going?
Stay there!

1142
01:59:08,655 --> 01:59:11,180
Time's over for you

1143
01:59:11,691 --> 01:59:13,591
And my promise stands fuIfiIIed

1144
01:59:16,963 --> 01:59:18,692
Goodbye, Karan.
- Where are you going, RahuI?

1145
01:59:18,898 --> 01:59:20,798
Have a good Iife.
- You're Ieaving me aIone?

1146
01:59:21,034 --> 01:59:24,094
Are you Ieaving your friend aIone?
Don't Ieave me aIone

1147
01:59:24,971 --> 01:59:29,067
RahuI, don't Ieave me here! PIease!
