1
00:00:13,228 --> 00:00:15,115
My God, it is cold!

2
00:00:15,371 --> 00:00:17,127
It must be 20 below
with the wind chill.

3
00:00:17,387 --> 00:00:19,526
This is no place for a Mexican.

4
00:00:19,979 --> 00:00:21,441
I thought you hated
night shift.

5
00:00:21,675 --> 00:00:23,585
I'm filling in for Haleh.

6
00:00:23,884 --> 00:00:25,793
We'll see plenty of
frostbite tonight.

7
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:29,126
And bum-sicles.
I hate the smell when they thaw.

8
00:00:38,763 --> 00:00:40,324
Place looks dead.

9
00:00:41,835 --> 00:00:43,974
Well, this guy certainly is.

10
00:00:45,995 --> 00:00:47,818
Randi, you know we got
a DB in the hall?

11
00:00:48,107 --> 00:00:50,758
The morgue's slow. I put him
near the door to keep cool.

12
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:52,449
- Good thinking.
- Is this right?

13
00:00:52,684 --> 00:00:54,145
Not a single patient.

14
00:00:54,412 --> 00:00:55,590
It's too cold to be sick.

15
00:00:55,851 --> 00:00:58,983
I guess I'm gonna have time to
work on my curriculum vitae.

16
00:00:59,244 --> 00:01:00,072
What's that?

17
00:01:00,331 --> 00:01:03,680
It's a fancy word for r Ásum Á.
I've got tenure review this week.

18
00:01:03,979 --> 00:01:05,889
- You wanna join the faculty?
- It'd be nice.

19
00:01:06,155 --> 00:01:09,865
Dr. Greene? Legal sent you
this letter and charts to be signed.

20
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:13,002
They're writing me up for not
co-signing charts.

21
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:14,820
Won't that hurt your chance?

22
00:01:15,083 --> 00:01:16,327
Won't help.

23
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:18,827
Competition pretty stiff?

24
00:01:19,052 --> 00:01:21,637
About 5'4", red hair, with a limp.

25
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:29,474
Lydia?

26
00:01:29,739 --> 00:01:31,561
How'd you like to make
an easy 50 bucks?

27
00:01:32,044 --> 00:01:32,774
How?

28
00:01:33,035 --> 00:01:35,752
I'm studying how exercise affects
the circadian rhythms...

29
00:01:36,011 --> 00:01:37,418
...of night shift workers.

30
00:01:37,708 --> 00:01:39,650
Is that why E-Ray's
doing jumping jacks?

31
00:01:39,884 --> 00:01:43,429
- Yes. But we need one more subject.
- My publishing deadline's in two days.

32
00:01:43,691 --> 00:01:45,284
So I'm kind of in a bind.

33
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:46,986
Sorry. Not interested.

34
00:01:48,395 --> 00:01:50,850
All right. We'll keep looking.

35
00:01:51,115 --> 00:01:52,195
Wendy.

36
00:02:02,603 --> 00:02:06,116
<i>Very good!</i>
<i>How much are a dozen bananas?</i>

37
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:14,725
- Very good!
- Thank you.

38
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:19,973
I left the packing till now.
I'll be here all night.

39
00:02:20,267 --> 00:02:22,340
- That presents opportunities.
- I have to pack.

40
00:02:22,572 --> 00:02:25,255
- Please!
- Come back at 3:00.

41
00:02:30,571 --> 00:02:33,124
Have you seen Carter?
Someone said he's in here.

42
00:02:33,388 --> 00:02:34,817
Doesn't look like it.

43
00:02:35,115 --> 00:02:38,431
- Sorry. Have a safe trip.
- Thank you. Bye-bye.

44
00:02:42,443 --> 00:02:43,458
Carol?

45
00:02:43,755 --> 00:02:44,518
Mary, what's up?

46
00:02:44,779 --> 00:02:45,859
Budget just came out.

47
00:02:46,091 --> 00:02:48,328
We've got a crisis conference
tomorrow morning.

48
00:02:48,619 --> 00:02:51,816
- Crisis conference?
- ER nursing's $94,000 over.

49
00:02:52,043 --> 00:02:52,872
Can't we add to it?

50
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:55,335
You're gonna have
to let two nurses go.

51
00:02:55,627 --> 00:02:57,220
But I'm understaffed as it is.

52
00:02:57,484 --> 00:02:59,272
Name me a department that isn't.

53
00:02:59,499 --> 00:03:01,158
The county's out of money.

54
00:03:01,419 --> 00:03:03,307
You've got three junior RNs:
Maylik...

55
00:03:03,563 --> 00:03:06,181
- Malik.
- Malik McGrath, Chuny Marquez and Conni...

56
00:03:06,443 --> 00:03:07,817
Oligario.

57
00:03:08,075 --> 00:03:09,504
You can keep one.

58
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:10,852
Which two get the ax?

59
00:03:11,755 --> 00:03:12,737
That's your decision.

60
00:03:13,004 --> 00:03:15,208
I don't know.
I've never done this before.

61
00:03:15,499 --> 00:03:18,947
I gotta have an answer by tomorrow.
Are you on tonight?

62
00:03:21,195 --> 00:03:22,122
Leave it on my e-mail.

63
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:24,681
Make sure I get it by
8 in the morning.

64
00:04:17,195 --> 00:04:19,617
If you could choose how to die,
how would you do it?

65
00:04:19,915 --> 00:04:21,159
That's morbid.

66
00:04:21,387 --> 00:04:23,656
If I could choose how to die,
I'd go by OD.

67
00:04:23,915 --> 00:04:26,850
- A stroke is better.
- Lf you survive, you're an end table.

68
00:04:27,115 --> 00:04:29,636
- Still no patients?
- Nope, but we got takeout.

69
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,329
We ordered you your usual.

70
00:04:31,627 --> 00:04:32,641
What do I owe you, Chuny?

71
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:34,468
- Put it away.
- Come on. Conni?

72
00:04:34,731 --> 00:04:36,225
- We got you covered.
- Thanks.

73
00:04:36,491 --> 00:04:38,662
- My hands cold?
- Oh, God! Sadist!

74
00:04:38,923 --> 00:04:41,476
I'm sorry about that
surprise Christmas morning.

75
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:42,600
Santa didn't come?

76
00:04:42,859 --> 00:04:45,445
I opened my door to
a homeless street urchin.

77
00:04:45,707 --> 00:04:48,096
- You opened my door.
- Right. I opened her door.

78
00:04:48,396 --> 00:04:50,632
- She stole Mom's silverware.
- I'll pay for it.

79
00:04:50,859 --> 00:04:53,478
- She won't take your money.
- I won't offer again.

80
00:04:53,739 --> 00:04:57,035
My New Year's resolution is to
resist charitable impulses.

81
00:04:57,323 --> 00:05:00,073
Risk Management said we're
overdue for a safety check.

82
00:05:00,331 --> 00:05:01,062
Why tell me?

83
00:05:01,323 --> 00:05:04,226
You're the safety officer.
They want it done tonight.

84
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:07,078
- I got 50 charts to do...
- Carol and I will take it.

85
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:09,282
What happened to resisting
charitable impulses?

86
00:05:09,547 --> 00:05:12,581
Speaking of, anyone wanna
sign up for a night shift study?

87
00:05:15,371 --> 00:05:16,997
Boy, it is dead!

88
00:05:17,259 --> 00:05:19,234
Finished my charts.
It's not even 9:00.

89
00:05:19,499 --> 00:05:21,604
- Want some action?
- What do you got in mind?

90
00:05:21,867 --> 00:05:25,413
Edson's sick, you can take
his place on the code team.

91
00:05:25,675 --> 00:05:26,471
Absolutely.

92
00:05:26,763 --> 00:05:27,810
Hey, John.

93
00:05:28,075 --> 00:05:29,187
He boned me, man!

94
00:05:30,827 --> 00:05:31,755
Benton wouldn't let you off?

95
00:05:32,107 --> 00:05:34,474
Two days is all I asked for.
Son of a bitch!

96
00:05:35,115 --> 00:05:36,839
You know, Dennis...

97
00:05:37,099 --> 00:05:40,416
...if Monique's with this other guy,
there's nothing you can do...

98
00:05:40,683 --> 00:05:42,342
...even if you did fly down there.

99
00:05:42,603 --> 00:05:44,970
I'd sure as hell like
the chance to try.

100
00:05:48,683 --> 00:05:51,334
You wanna go to that place
and get some fries with gravy?

101
00:05:51,595 --> 00:05:53,962
I wish I could.
I got all these charts to do.

102
00:05:54,571 --> 00:05:56,098
Okay. I hear you.

103
00:05:56,907 --> 00:05:59,296
If Benton asks, I'll be
back in an hour.

104
00:06:03,627 --> 00:06:05,515
I thought you finished the charts.

105
00:06:05,739 --> 00:06:08,936
I've listened to him moan about
that girlfriend for two weeks.

106
00:06:09,227 --> 00:06:10,405
Tonight is slow enough.

107
00:06:11,275 --> 00:06:12,584
Who's our first lucky customer?

108
00:06:12,843 --> 00:06:15,363
Lady fell asleep at McGoo's.
Waitress brought her in.

109
00:06:15,595 --> 00:06:18,378
She's kind of loopy. No I.D.
Says her name's Shelly.

110
00:06:19,435 --> 00:06:21,890
No needles!
I just wanna sleep.

111
00:06:22,155 --> 00:06:24,773
Temp's 103, and look at this.

112
00:06:25,643 --> 00:06:26,374
Photophobia.

113
00:06:26,924 --> 00:06:29,029
I'm Dr. Greene.
I need to examine you.

114
00:06:29,323 --> 00:06:30,184
Leave me alone!

115
00:06:31,243 --> 00:06:34,178
You have symptoms of meningitis,
which is really serious.

116
00:06:34,571 --> 00:06:37,320
We need to do a spinal tap
just to be sure.

117
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:40,706
Let me give you
a shot of antibiotics.

118
00:06:40,972 --> 00:06:42,182
No needles, I said!

119
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:48,903
If you do have meningitis and we
don't treat you, you could die.

120
00:06:49,163 --> 00:06:50,985
Die, cry, let me fry.

121
00:06:57,131 --> 00:06:58,342
Do you know where you are?

122
00:06:58,603 --> 00:07:02,433
In the hospital, talking to Dr. Greene
with a head like a bean.

123
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:05,416
Do you know what day it is?

124
00:07:05,707 --> 00:07:09,056
Thursday, January 16th.
Bing! Correct!

125
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:13,382
Alex Trebek, next:
Stupid Questions for $ 200.

126
00:07:14,923 --> 00:07:18,786
I'm 90o/o sure it's meningitis, which
is probably causing her mental status.

127
00:07:19,051 --> 00:07:20,229
She won't let me take blood.

128
00:07:20,491 --> 00:07:21,952
She can't make her own decisions.

129
00:07:22,219 --> 00:07:24,586
- I need a consent override.
- Run it by Risk Management.

130
00:07:24,843 --> 00:07:26,119
- No, I don't.
- Yeah, you do.

131
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:28,201
All consent overrides
go through Legal.

132
00:07:28,747 --> 00:07:31,081
Fine. Tell them
I'm doing a spinal tap...

133
00:07:31,307 --> 00:07:33,958
...on a demented woman
without her consent.

134
00:07:36,395 --> 00:07:40,105
Well, we've got some loose tile here.
And some crumbling grout.

135
00:07:40,395 --> 00:07:42,020
Faulty tile and grout.

136
00:07:42,283 --> 00:07:44,072
This could be trouble
in an open wound.

137
00:07:44,331 --> 00:07:45,738
Trouble indeed! Good catch.

138
00:07:45,995 --> 00:07:47,751
Did you note
the wobbly IV stands?

139
00:07:47,979 --> 00:07:49,801
Roger that.
You got a flair for this.

140
00:07:50,091 --> 00:07:51,618
Thank you.

141
00:07:52,235 --> 00:07:53,413
You know...

142
00:07:54,123 --> 00:07:56,360
...this clock could fall
right off the wall.

143
00:07:56,619 --> 00:07:58,626
I don't know how you do it.

144
00:07:59,403 --> 00:08:02,436
It's established that night work
disrupts circadian rhythms.

145
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:03,462
I've heard that.

146
00:08:03,723 --> 00:08:05,895
I hope to prove
moderate physical exertion...

147
00:08:06,187 --> 00:08:08,707
...can switch circadian rhythms
back into phase.

148
00:08:09,547 --> 00:08:11,205
When you say
"moderate physical exertion"...

149
00:08:11,467 --> 00:08:14,980
A few minute's exercise.
Jog around the block. Not strenuous.

150
00:08:15,243 --> 00:08:16,323
It's all set up.

151
00:08:16,619 --> 00:08:18,594
I don't know, I'm not in good shape.

152
00:08:18,827 --> 00:08:20,616
You look plenty healthy to me.

153
00:08:27,691 --> 00:08:28,705
Oh, my God!

154
00:08:29,003 --> 00:08:30,693
- Are you okay?
- What were you doing?

155
00:08:30,955 --> 00:08:32,417
Safety check. You okay?

156
00:08:32,651 --> 00:08:34,374
- I'm bleeding.
- I can stitch it up.

157
00:08:34,635 --> 00:08:36,642
I would prefer Jeanie.

158
00:08:39,371 --> 00:08:41,672
And you were doing so well.

159
00:08:50,091 --> 00:08:52,131
Maggie, you got anything good?

160
00:08:52,363 --> 00:08:54,502
Carol Hathaway dropped
a clock on Weaver's head.

161
00:08:54,731 --> 00:08:57,284
- Deliberately?
- I'm foggy on the details.

162
00:08:57,579 --> 00:08:59,303
We got paramedics pulling up.

163
00:08:59,563 --> 00:09:00,425
Now we're talking!

164
00:09:00,715 --> 00:09:03,879
- Nobody called for a surgical consult.
- I'm saving you the trouble.

165
00:09:04,139 --> 00:09:06,179
Found him on the floor
in acute distress.

166
00:09:06,475 --> 00:09:08,482
Chest and belly pain.
Vitals, normal.

167
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:09,794
Wouldn't let us start an IV.

168
00:09:10,059 --> 00:09:10,920
Does this hurt?

169
00:09:11,563 --> 00:09:12,424
Looks like a surgical abdomen.

170
00:09:12,683 --> 00:09:14,920
- I haven't made that assessment.
- You don't have to.

171
00:09:15,211 --> 00:09:17,098
Should I call for an Attending?

172
00:09:18,315 --> 00:09:20,551
Up and over!

173
00:09:21,675 --> 00:09:23,431
Let's get an IV started.

174
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:25,827
I think I hear a rub.

175
00:09:26,091 --> 00:09:27,368
I may have a pulsatile mass.

176
00:09:27,627 --> 00:09:28,837
Give me a 12-lead and a chest film.

177
00:09:29,099 --> 00:09:29,960
Get me a cross-table abdomen.

178
00:09:30,219 --> 00:09:31,080
- Which first?
- Chest.

179
00:09:31,371 --> 00:09:33,542
Abdomen.
He could have an aneurysm.

180
00:09:33,803 --> 00:09:35,942
- I don't want to miss an acute MI.
- I don't want to miss a triple-A.

181
00:09:36,235 --> 00:09:37,380
If it's an MI, he needs TPA.

182
00:09:37,611 --> 00:09:39,204
If it's an aneurysm,
he goes to O.R.

183
00:09:39,467 --> 00:09:40,677
Time is heart muscle.

184
00:09:40,971 --> 00:09:42,596
Ever have an aneurysm
blow up in your face?

185
00:09:42,859 --> 00:09:44,266
Hey, guys.

186
00:09:45,259 --> 00:09:46,404
I'm feeling much better.

187
00:09:46,699 --> 00:09:48,161
- You need to lie down.
- You need x-rays.

188
00:09:48,395 --> 00:09:49,322
No. I'm fine...

189
00:09:49,611 --> 00:09:52,393
...except for a stuffy nose.
Could I have a flu shot?

190
00:09:52,651 --> 00:09:53,796
I remember this dude.

191
00:09:54,059 --> 00:09:57,158
To get a ride to the hospital,
he calls 911 and plays possum.

192
00:09:57,387 --> 00:10:00,616
But I'm on Social Security.
I can't afford a cab.

193
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:02,882
And it's too cold for the bus.

194
00:10:03,147 --> 00:10:04,074
You want a flu shot?

195
00:10:04,331 --> 00:10:05,957
If it wouldn't be too much trouble?

196
00:10:06,219 --> 00:10:07,233
It's all yours.

197
00:10:07,499 --> 00:10:09,222
Gee, thanks!

198
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:12,778
I'm just saying, there's no point
in me going back to general surgery.

199
00:10:13,034 --> 00:10:13,983
You learned all there is?

200
00:10:14,251 --> 00:10:15,974
I want another Pediatric rotation.

201
00:10:16,235 --> 00:10:17,795
- Why?
- I want to be a pediatric surgeon.

202
00:10:23,659 --> 00:10:25,601
She said that my technique
was excellent.

203
00:10:27,723 --> 00:10:31,106
You're in luck. He's doing
a jejunal atresia tonight.

204
00:10:31,403 --> 00:10:34,305
If he'll take you,
you're back in Pediatric.

205
00:10:34,795 --> 00:10:36,705
Could I cover Pedes Sick-U?

206
00:10:41,547 --> 00:10:42,724
Anything else?

207
00:10:43,787 --> 00:10:45,314
No, thank you.

208
00:10:49,131 --> 00:10:51,880
- Chuny, you got that LP tray?
- By the door.

209
00:10:52,491 --> 00:10:54,379
Can you give us a hand?
We may need you.

210
00:10:54,635 --> 00:10:55,366
There's someone...

211
00:10:55,626 --> 00:10:57,634
Why won't you tell me your address?

212
00:10:57,931 --> 00:10:59,338
Excuse me. Who are you?

213
00:10:59,563 --> 00:11:00,676
Dr. Greene?

214
00:11:00,939 --> 00:11:04,419
Pat Guinet, Hospital Counsel. You
want to do a spinal tap on this patient?

215
00:11:04,683 --> 00:11:06,657
- That's right.
- She's not keen on the idea.

216
00:11:06,923 --> 00:11:08,930
I've assessed her
as mentally incompetent.

217
00:11:09,227 --> 00:11:11,114
We just had a fairly
coherent conversation.

218
00:11:11,339 --> 00:11:12,648
Is that a medical diagnosis?

219
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:16,394
Look, doctor, she's clearly
a borderline case.

220
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:18,658
We have been sued
by these patients in the past.

221
00:11:18,955 --> 00:11:21,475
I'm saving her life,
and you're talking legal exposure.

222
00:11:22,091 --> 00:11:23,040
That's why I'm paid.

223
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:24,834
I'm paid to help sick people.

224
00:11:25,099 --> 00:11:27,106
I'm not gonna wrestle
with you, doctor.

225
00:11:27,403 --> 00:11:28,930
I'm writing on the chart:

226
00:11:29,707 --> 00:11:33,504
"You're advised against treating
this woman without her consent."

227
00:11:33,739 --> 00:11:34,502
And you and anyone...

228
00:11:34,763 --> 00:11:38,341
...who assists you, will be
putting your jobs in jeopardy.

229
00:11:39,883 --> 00:11:41,345
Get a psych consult.

230
00:11:41,579 --> 00:11:45,223
If they agree she's incompetent,
put her on a hold and proceed.

231
00:11:45,931 --> 00:11:47,753
Until then, don't touch her.

232
00:11:56,683 --> 00:11:58,243
Just one more stitch.

233
00:11:58,538 --> 00:12:01,605
Have you given any more thought
to participating in my study?

234
00:12:01,835 --> 00:12:03,361
I've got paperwork I need to do.

235
00:12:03,595 --> 00:12:06,562
It won't take much time.
Just 15 minutes every couple hours.

236
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:09,729
- Lf we get busy, it'll be a problem.
- It's been slow so far.

237
00:12:12,107 --> 00:12:14,016
My being HIV-positive
won't skew the results?

238
00:12:14,283 --> 00:12:15,876
Won't make a bit of difference.

239
00:12:16,266 --> 00:12:18,852
Tonight's my last night to
collect data. And if l...

240
00:12:19,146 --> 00:12:21,830
My findings will be incom...
well, worthless, really.

241
00:12:22,091 --> 00:12:24,840
But see, if you're too busy,
I respect your decision.

242
00:12:25,674 --> 00:12:29,351
Just as I've always respected
and supported your decisions.

243
00:12:31,947 --> 00:12:33,889
What would I have to do?

244
00:12:34,154 --> 00:12:35,845
He scores!

245
00:12:40,395 --> 00:12:43,046
- We finally get a bonafide patient?
- But we can't touch her.

246
00:12:43,306 --> 00:12:45,510
She asked for another blanket
and a snack.

247
00:12:45,771 --> 00:12:48,138
So we're not a hospital,
we're a bed-and-breakfast?

248
00:12:48,395 --> 00:12:49,126
Psych come down?

249
00:12:49,387 --> 00:12:52,038
- No, not yet.
- Try again. I'll be in the lounge.

250
00:12:52,298 --> 00:12:55,594
- Call Missing Persons?
- Yeah, but no one's missed her.

251
00:12:56,011 --> 00:12:58,499
We got a wheelchair with no brakes...

252
00:12:58,762 --> 00:13:01,097
...and three IV stands
I think are wobbly.

253
00:13:01,355 --> 00:13:02,762
What do we do with them?

254
00:13:03,306 --> 00:13:04,037
Ugly!

255
00:13:04,299 --> 00:13:06,208
If it isn't my favorite thief.

256
00:13:06,442 --> 00:13:07,686
You got your wallet back.

257
00:13:07,914 --> 00:13:09,191
My mother's silverware?

258
00:13:09,482 --> 00:13:10,628
I didn't take it. I swear.

259
00:13:10,859 --> 00:13:13,248
Do I call Security,
or will you leave by yourself?

260
00:13:13,547 --> 00:13:16,394
No, listen, man.
I need some bread.

261
00:13:16,683 --> 00:13:17,544
No, serious.

262
00:13:17,962 --> 00:13:20,231
There's this dude trying to pimp me.
And I don't wanna...

263
00:13:20,523 --> 00:13:23,273
He says I gotta pay him
100 bucks, or he'll kill me.

264
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:25,123
Maybe we should tell the cops.

265
00:13:25,386 --> 00:13:26,597
I don't deal with cops.

266
00:13:26,827 --> 00:13:30,656
And I don't deal with liars who take
advantage of people who help them.

267
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:32,393
You're a creep. You know that?

268
00:13:32,747 --> 00:13:34,089
A creep and a pervert!

269
00:13:34,859 --> 00:13:37,030
That's right! This doctor
made me go down on him!

270
00:13:37,322 --> 00:13:38,751
He gave me VD.
He got me pregnant!

271
00:13:38,986 --> 00:13:41,442
And now he wants me
to pay for the abortion!

272
00:13:41,706 --> 00:13:43,015
Child molester!

273
00:13:44,779 --> 00:13:46,339
Lovely girl.

274
00:13:50,154 --> 00:13:52,543
I wanted to ask you about
a Pediatric surgical rotation.

275
00:13:55,179 --> 00:13:56,608
This isn't a good time.

276
00:13:56,843 --> 00:13:59,560
I'll be in Pedes Sick-U all night.

277
00:14:05,354 --> 00:14:08,071
- You were looking for me?
- You're on Sick-U with me.

278
00:14:08,331 --> 00:14:09,313
Isn't Zeidenberg on?

279
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:12,993
Order everyone's labs
and advance the drain on Bed 3.

280
00:14:17,386 --> 00:14:18,401
Here's one for you.

281
00:14:18,667 --> 00:14:20,096
"Longing for your embrace.

282
00:14:20,362 --> 00:14:24,072
Financial officer seeks life
of adventure with very special lady."

283
00:14:24,362 --> 00:14:26,370
- Forget it.
- Sounds like money, honey.

284
00:14:26,634 --> 00:14:28,457
What are we gonna talk about?
Dow averages?

285
00:14:29,995 --> 00:14:32,166
"Sensual M.D., 35.

286
00:14:32,459 --> 00:14:33,604
- 6' 1 ".
- I like tall.

287
00:14:33,866 --> 00:14:36,866
Makes up in passion what
he lacks in hair."

288
00:14:39,339 --> 00:14:40,287
Not me.

289
00:14:41,738 --> 00:14:43,462
I'm not so desperate to use personals.

290
00:14:43,691 --> 00:14:44,738
You calling me desperate?

291
00:14:45,515 --> 00:14:46,977
No. That's not what I meant.

292
00:14:47,242 --> 00:14:48,803
So where do you find all your dates?

293
00:14:49,066 --> 00:14:51,303
- I haven't had one in a while.
- See?

294
00:14:51,563 --> 00:14:53,188
Don't knock it till you try it.

295
00:14:54,026 --> 00:14:55,969
Dr. Greene,
psych's here on that lady.

296
00:14:56,715 --> 00:14:57,663
Who is it? McDonald?

297
00:14:57,931 --> 00:14:59,011
No, some intern.

298
00:15:06,923 --> 00:15:08,613
I didn't realize we were
coming down this hallway.

299
00:15:08,907 --> 00:15:10,794
Neither did I.

300
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:12,992
Which room was it, anyway?

301
00:15:13,707 --> 00:15:14,754
I don't know.

302
00:15:15,082 --> 00:15:17,952
It was either this door or this one.

303
00:15:18,218 --> 00:15:20,455
No, Doug. It's this one.

304
00:15:20,715 --> 00:15:22,984
Right. Lots of stolen
moments in there, huh?

305
00:15:23,274 --> 00:15:24,867
Yes, there were.

306
00:15:25,483 --> 00:15:26,825
So should we?

307
00:15:27,722 --> 00:15:29,097
- What?
- Open the door.

308
00:15:29,355 --> 00:15:30,599
Oh, yeah, sure.
Why not?

309
00:15:30,858 --> 00:15:33,411
Come on. You got it?

310
00:15:36,202 --> 00:15:38,919
- Did it always smell like this?
- I think it did.

311
00:15:39,179 --> 00:15:40,870
Now, if I remember...

312
00:15:41,131 --> 00:15:44,447
...I bet we still got some candles.

313
00:15:45,387 --> 00:15:47,721
- What?
- Yep! Look at this.

314
00:15:48,234 --> 00:15:49,445
Got a match?

315
00:15:49,739 --> 00:15:51,462
Oh, my God!

316
00:15:52,266 --> 00:15:55,048
Shelly, I'm gonna ask you to commit
three things to memory:

317
00:15:55,339 --> 00:15:58,951
A fire engine, a mobile home
and a pen.

318
00:15:59,211 --> 00:15:59,941
Why?

319
00:16:00,202 --> 00:16:01,380
Just try to remember them.

320
00:16:01,674 --> 00:16:03,103
Can you tell me the date?

321
00:16:03,338 --> 00:16:04,266
Get away!

322
00:16:04,554 --> 00:16:05,896
Temp's up to 103.5.

323
00:16:06,122 --> 00:16:08,227
Look, we're running out of time.

324
00:16:08,523 --> 00:16:10,083
Shelly? The date?

325
00:16:10,347 --> 00:16:12,616
I already told Dr. Greene-bean.

326
00:16:13,483 --> 00:16:14,890
Was she oriented to time?

327
00:16:15,147 --> 00:16:16,608
More or less.

328
00:16:16,842 --> 00:16:18,598
Oriented to time.

329
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:22,847
Shelly, can you spell "world"
backwards?

330
00:16:23,946 --> 00:16:28,256
U-O-Y
W-E-R-C-S.

331
00:16:30,507 --> 00:16:31,455
Screw you.

332
00:16:32,011 --> 00:16:32,741
Backwards.

333
00:16:33,162 --> 00:16:34,340
Right.

334
00:16:34,635 --> 00:16:36,457
Good concentration.

335
00:16:36,971 --> 00:16:39,753
Can you remember the things
I told you earlier?

336
00:16:40,043 --> 00:16:41,220
Yes.

337
00:16:41,802 --> 00:16:42,948
What are they?

338
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:45,857
A fire engine, a pen, a mobile home.

339
00:16:46,123 --> 00:16:48,578
Now leave me alone, cornpone.

340
00:16:49,482 --> 00:16:51,173
She's oriented to person,
time and place.

341
00:16:51,402 --> 00:16:53,442
Her mental status exam is normal.

342
00:16:53,739 --> 00:16:55,910
She's uncooperative,
she speaks in rhyme...

343
00:16:56,171 --> 00:16:58,822
...and doesn't care that she
could die without treatment.

344
00:16:59,082 --> 00:17:01,984
There are criteria for competence.
She doesn't meet them.

345
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:05,545
She's a woman with no I.D.,
found passed out in a restaurant.

346
00:17:05,802 --> 00:17:07,144
She doesn't meet the criteria.

347
00:17:07,402 --> 00:17:09,671
Do you realize your
decision could kill her?

348
00:17:10,186 --> 00:17:12,390
That kind of hyperbole
isn't very helpful.

349
00:17:12,683 --> 00:17:14,657
Patients have a right
to make bad decisions.

350
00:17:14,923 --> 00:17:18,338
- Not when they're demented.
- That's where we disagree.

351
00:17:20,171 --> 00:17:23,204
Get McDonald down here.
Tell him it's life or death.

352
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:30,119
Dr. Benton?

353
00:17:30,379 --> 00:17:32,484
The Serena kid's in
second-degree heart block.

354
00:17:32,778 --> 00:17:33,891
Where's his chart?

355
00:17:34,123 --> 00:17:36,905
- Kenner's patient?
- Yeah, but Kenner's back in surgery.

356
00:17:39,211 --> 00:17:40,138
Where are the labs?

357
00:17:40,427 --> 00:17:42,215
- On the chart.
- The calcium's not here.

358
00:17:42,474 --> 00:17:43,587
It wasn't picked up.

359
00:17:43,819 --> 00:17:48,161
Give him 30 of Lasix, IV push, and run
a liter of saline to diurese him.

360
00:17:48,459 --> 00:17:49,320
Where's Gant?

361
00:17:49,579 --> 00:17:50,855
I don't know.

362
00:17:51,114 --> 00:17:53,765
Dr. Fogg at Cambridge did
a similar study with rodents...

363
00:17:53,994 --> 00:17:57,704
...and could double serum cortisol
with five minutes on the treadmill.

364
00:17:57,994 --> 00:18:00,449
- How many more minutes do I have?
- Fifteen.

365
00:18:00,714 --> 00:18:03,103
Dr. Weaver, I'm getting
a reading of 500 lux.

366
00:18:03,371 --> 00:18:05,738
- Put the goggles on her.
- Goggles?

367
00:18:05,995 --> 00:18:07,369
The lights approximate daylight.

368
00:18:07,626 --> 00:18:10,277
We wanna make sure your body
thinks it's night.

369
00:18:11,946 --> 00:18:12,994
What else do I have to do?

370
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:16,454
One more exertion test, heart
and lung readings, and that's it.

371
00:18:16,971 --> 00:18:20,680
Wendy, let's take
the RPMs up to 90.

372
00:18:29,131 --> 00:18:30,854
I met the guy once last summer.

373
00:18:31,115 --> 00:18:33,384
Some type of mortgage broker.

374
00:18:34,699 --> 00:18:36,128
I don't know when
she started seeing him.

375
00:18:36,394 --> 00:18:39,264
Why are you here when a kid
is dying of hypercalcemia?

376
00:18:39,818 --> 00:18:41,640
You're supposed to monitor
his calcium.

377
00:18:41,962 --> 00:18:44,418
- I sent the labs in.
- Why, if you don't check them?

378
00:18:44,682 --> 00:18:45,544
It takes an hour.

379
00:18:45,834 --> 00:18:47,776
Look at this. 13.5!

380
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:50,912
- He went into a bradyarrhythmia.
- I was going to get them.

381
00:18:51,179 --> 00:18:53,568
Gant, that kind of excuse
kills patients.

382
00:18:54,059 --> 00:18:56,993
If you can't do the job,
then you don't need to be here.

383
00:18:58,187 --> 00:19:00,904
Make another stupid
mistake like that, you won't be.

384
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:13,314
Hey, you okay?

385
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:18,150
It's a code.
I'm on the code team.

386
00:19:18,442 --> 00:19:21,410
Listen, we'll talk, all right?
We'll talk when I get back?

387
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:27,876
It's weird, being down here again.

388
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:29,893
Makes me realize how unhappy I was.

389
00:19:30,123 --> 00:19:31,366
When you were with me?

390
00:19:31,595 --> 00:19:35,042
It wasn't your fault.
I just didn't think much of myself.

391
00:19:35,339 --> 00:19:38,917
- I'm sure I didn't help.
- A lot of stuff didn't help.

392
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:42,823
But it's just different now, you know?
I actually feel good.

393
00:19:43,082 --> 00:19:45,221
What's different besides us not
being together?

394
00:19:45,483 --> 00:19:47,719
I used to think I couldn't do things.

395
00:19:48,011 --> 00:19:49,352
Now I'm taking a pre-med course.

396
00:19:50,474 --> 00:19:52,962
I trust you did well
on your midterms.

397
00:19:53,226 --> 00:19:54,371
B plus.

398
00:19:54,635 --> 00:19:56,260
Clearly, you're not trying
hard enough.

399
00:19:58,571 --> 00:20:00,513
I guess it's about feeling in control.

400
00:20:00,778 --> 00:20:01,706
I guess.

401
00:20:01,963 --> 00:20:04,745
Of course,
there's things you can't control.

402
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:06,214
Such as?

403
00:20:06,474 --> 00:20:09,027
Administration's making me
fire two nurses.

404
00:20:09,899 --> 00:20:11,808
- Really?
- But don't tell anyone.

405
00:20:12,074 --> 00:20:14,114
They don't know, and I
don't know who it'll be.

406
00:20:14,378 --> 00:20:16,418
I'm not gonna say a thing.

407
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:18,438
You know what's really depressing?

408
00:20:18,731 --> 00:20:20,324
Being here right now...

409
00:20:20,586 --> 00:20:23,336
...makes me realize how much
happier I was back then.

410
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:28,582
- God, you're pathetic.
- Yes.

411
00:20:34,122 --> 00:20:36,010
- You on the code team?
- I was gonna ask you.

412
00:20:36,267 --> 00:20:38,722
- Where the hell is A-360?
- I was gonna ask that too.

413
00:20:38,986 --> 00:20:41,256
Do you know where A-360 is?
Somebody's having a heart attack.

414
00:20:41,514 --> 00:20:44,417
Sorry. Have you seen the men's
room? A toilet overflowed.

415
00:20:44,682 --> 00:20:46,504
Nope. Can't help you.

416
00:20:47,787 --> 00:20:49,380
"290, 310.

417
00:20:50,571 --> 00:20:51,498
320.

418
00:20:51,754 --> 00:20:53,664
- 330."
- It must be this way.

419
00:20:58,442 --> 00:20:59,904
- I'll do the central line.
- I will.

420
00:21:00,171 --> 00:21:02,953
- Have you run a code before?
- More than you have.

421
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:08,704
Well, here's the toilet.

422
00:21:10,538 --> 00:21:11,912
Code team? You're late.

423
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:13,348
Oh, no!

424
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:20,581
- I'll take over.
- I got it.

425
00:21:22,634 --> 00:21:23,779
He's got a rhythm.

426
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:25,568
- I got a good pulse.
- Thank God!

427
00:21:25,835 --> 00:21:29,697
CPR course finally paid off.
Now, if I could just find that john!

428
00:21:29,962 --> 00:21:31,271
Dr. Carter will show you.

429
00:21:33,962 --> 00:21:36,232
- Know why I hate going to a shrink?
- Why?

430
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:38,498
Because you have to
talk about yourself.

431
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:40,614
That's the point, Doug.

432
00:21:40,874 --> 00:21:43,263
It's embarrassing.
I tell her about my patients.

433
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:44,391
She lets you?

434
00:21:44,683 --> 00:21:48,709
She says I prefer talking about them
because solving their problems...

435
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:50,280
...is easier than solving my own.

436
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:52,482
It's probably true.

437
00:21:52,778 --> 00:21:54,883
Sometimes, yeah. Sometimes, no.

438
00:21:59,658 --> 00:22:02,047
You thinking about Charlie?

439
00:22:02,315 --> 00:22:04,137
I was tough on her today.

440
00:22:04,426 --> 00:22:06,663
Well, you know,
you gave her a chance.

441
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:11,145
Several. There's a certain point
you just gotta say, "No. It's over."

442
00:22:13,098 --> 00:22:15,432
Why do those words
sound familiar to me?

443
00:22:26,923 --> 00:22:29,476
Conni and I wrote
a personal ad for you. Wanna hear?

444
00:22:29,738 --> 00:22:30,666
Sure.

445
00:22:30,922 --> 00:22:33,126
"Sensitive doctor.
Tall, white and handsome."

446
00:22:33,386 --> 00:22:35,175
- Handsome? Really?
- Sure. Why not?

447
00:22:35,722 --> 00:22:37,347
"Loves the Cubs and Kawasakis."

448
00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:40,512
Hold on. I own a bike,
I don't know if I love it.

449
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:42,120
Chicks love guys with bikes.

450
00:22:42,314 --> 00:22:43,743
I got mine in the garage.

451
00:22:44,042 --> 00:22:44,806
Your bike?

452
00:22:45,066 --> 00:22:47,935
They let me keep it here.
But I haven't run it.

453
00:22:48,202 --> 00:22:50,438
- Your battery's gonna die.
- I gotta start it up.

454
00:22:51,658 --> 00:22:55,335
Don't mention the bike. I don't
wanna attract motorcycle chicks.

455
00:22:56,522 --> 00:22:57,667
Someone like me?

456
00:22:58,251 --> 00:22:59,745
No. I didn't mean...

457
00:23:00,042 --> 00:23:02,082
Shelly's gone
and so are her clothes.

458
00:23:02,314 --> 00:23:05,216
- Check the restrooms.
- I did that already.

459
00:23:05,482 --> 00:23:07,489
Did you see a female
patient leave here?

460
00:23:07,786 --> 00:23:08,899
Brown hair and red hat?

461
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:10,210
She just left.

462
00:23:10,506 --> 00:23:11,367
I'll get Security.

463
00:23:11,626 --> 00:23:13,448
Could you grab my coat?

464
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:25,512
Shelly? Shelly?

465
00:23:25,802 --> 00:23:28,136
Shelly, you need to come back inside.

466
00:23:28,362 --> 00:23:29,704
I want the bus.

467
00:23:29,962 --> 00:23:30,977
Listen to me.

468
00:23:31,242 --> 00:23:33,893
You're very sick.
We need to treat you.

469
00:23:34,154 --> 00:23:35,878
- Right away.
- Go away.

470
00:23:36,138 --> 00:23:37,764
Shelly, come on.

471
00:23:39,338 --> 00:23:42,120
Put me down!
I wanna go on the bus!

472
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:45,381
Put me down!

473
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:48,392
Help! Help!

474
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:54,664
Why are you hurting me?

475
00:23:54,922 --> 00:23:57,224
Grab her legs.
Chuny, take her shoulders.

476
00:23:57,546 --> 00:23:59,968
Malik, bring her knees
up to her chest.

477
00:24:00,266 --> 00:24:01,924
What are you doing?

478
00:24:02,346 --> 00:24:04,288
I'm gonna give you
a shot to numb the skin.

479
00:24:04,522 --> 00:24:06,278
No! No needles, please!

480
00:24:09,258 --> 00:24:10,534
I don't see a psych hold.

481
00:24:10,794 --> 00:24:12,966
- Help me.
- I got tired of waiting.

482
00:24:16,619 --> 00:24:17,731
Hold still.

483
00:24:18,698 --> 00:24:20,007
I want everyone's names.

484
00:24:20,234 --> 00:24:21,794
- Chuny Marquez.
- Lydia Wright.

485
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:22,853
Malik McGrath.

486
00:24:23,082 --> 00:24:24,326
No, please!

487
00:24:31,434 --> 00:24:32,961
I got fluid.

488
00:24:33,962 --> 00:24:37,410
There I was, baring my soul
in a way I never really had before.

489
00:24:37,674 --> 00:24:41,384
- All of a sudden, I hear snoring.
- I'm sorry. I'm so tired.

490
00:24:41,642 --> 00:24:45,090
Oh, God! I've got 51/2 hours
to make my big staff decision.

491
00:24:45,354 --> 00:24:47,012
- What am I gonna do?
- Sorry, what?

492
00:24:47,274 --> 00:24:48,518
You're hilarious.

493
00:24:48,778 --> 00:24:50,501
Oh, my God!

494
00:24:51,338 --> 00:24:52,450
Charlie?

495
00:24:52,714 --> 00:24:53,924
Get a gurney! Let's go!

496
00:24:54,186 --> 00:24:55,015
What happened?

497
00:24:55,274 --> 00:24:57,761
- He found me.
- The pimp? Hang on.

498
00:24:58,026 --> 00:24:59,782
Get the gurney, Conni!

499
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:02,850
Benton was out of line.

500
00:25:03,114 --> 00:25:04,707
- Was he?
- Way out of line.

501
00:25:05,066 --> 00:25:09,256
- I feel like punching out the bastard.
- Well, that would be unwise.

502
00:25:09,546 --> 00:25:11,488
I suppose I could tell Anspaugh...

503
00:25:11,722 --> 00:25:14,756
...but then again, I don't know.
I think Benton's right.

504
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:18,847
Lately, I've been one step behind,
five minutes too late.

505
00:25:19,114 --> 00:25:20,325
See you.

506
00:25:21,802 --> 00:25:23,590
- Aren't you covering the ER?
- It's dead.

507
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:26,501
What I wouldn't give
for a good five-car pileup.

508
00:25:28,202 --> 00:25:29,729
It's 3:00.

509
00:25:31,978 --> 00:25:34,312
Time for the
<i>Charlie Chan Mystery Movie.</i>

510
00:25:38,186 --> 00:25:39,647
What's the point of this exactly?

511
00:25:39,882 --> 00:25:42,817
To compare your cortisol
after indoor and outdoor exertion.

512
00:25:43,114 --> 00:25:45,503
- That's it?
- No more sweating after this.

513
00:25:45,770 --> 00:25:47,712
Get your knees up, like a drum major.

514
00:25:47,978 --> 00:25:49,538
That's it. There you go.

515
00:25:49,802 --> 00:25:51,624
Go! Go! Go!

516
00:25:53,610 --> 00:25:55,683
Okay, sweetheart.
Squeeze this hand.

517
00:25:55,946 --> 00:25:58,728
Good. All right.
Now squeeze this hand.

518
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:01,632
That's okay. That's all right.

519
00:26:01,898 --> 00:26:05,313
- I think she's got a broken right ulna.
- Ears are clear.

520
00:26:05,578 --> 00:26:07,683
Can you move your jaw for me?
Side to side.

521
00:26:07,946 --> 00:26:08,742
It hurts.

522
00:26:09,002 --> 00:26:11,457
That's okay.
You're gonna be fine.

523
00:26:11,754 --> 00:26:13,925
Let's get a panorex.
She's got a broken jaw.

524
00:26:14,154 --> 00:26:18,180
Let's get a film of the chest,
right arm, orbits.

525
00:26:23,945 --> 00:26:27,294
She has bruising around her groin.
She may have been raped.

526
00:26:31,402 --> 00:26:32,776
All right, kiddo.

527
00:26:34,474 --> 00:26:35,783
It's okay.

528
00:26:38,794 --> 00:26:40,867
Your idea's gonna
make you a millionaire?

529
00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:42,656
- Money in the bank.
- Let's hear it.

530
00:26:42,922 --> 00:26:44,100
Flypaper in a can.

531
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:47,329
Like aerosol. You spray it on
your car so bugs stick to it.

532
00:26:47,562 --> 00:26:49,864
You peel off one big sheet.
Then boom!

533
00:26:50,154 --> 00:26:52,259
- Your car is clean.
- You're kidding, right?

534
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:55,338
- I'll call it "Bug Off."
- That's the dumbest idea ever.

535
00:26:55,594 --> 00:26:57,252
Why not just clean it off
with a hose?

536
00:26:57,514 --> 00:27:00,863
Okay, I got another one.
Stethoscope condoms.

537
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:02,178
I don't even want to know.

538
00:27:02,442 --> 00:27:04,384
Take my advice.
Don't quit your day job.

539
00:27:11,914 --> 00:27:13,059
How's it going?

540
00:27:13,322 --> 00:27:14,467
Dr. Kenner.

541
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:17,151
We had a scare.
His calcium went up to 13.5...

542
00:27:17,418 --> 00:27:19,141
...which sent him into heart block.

543
00:27:19,402 --> 00:27:22,882
I had to diurese him.
I got him back to a normal sinus.

544
00:27:29,098 --> 00:27:31,170
Well, it looks fine now.

545
00:27:31,434 --> 00:27:33,768
- Good work.
- Thank you.

546
00:27:38,282 --> 00:27:41,348
I'd like to do another
Pediatric rotation...

547
00:27:41,609 --> 00:27:43,365
...and I'd like to do it with you.

548
00:27:44,618 --> 00:27:46,341
Correct me if I'm wrong.

549
00:27:46,602 --> 00:27:49,384
I understood that Dr. Keaton
isn't recommending you.

550
00:27:50,186 --> 00:27:51,593
She told you that?

551
00:27:51,850 --> 00:27:55,233
Well, it is a pretty small club.
We do talk occasionally.

552
00:27:55,530 --> 00:27:59,240
Dr. Kenner, I learned a lot
from Dr. Keaton...

553
00:27:59,497 --> 00:28:03,688
...but our styles were very different.
We didn't quite mesh.

554
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:09,858
Why don't you talk to her
and tell her your perspective...

555
00:28:10,122 --> 00:28:12,675
...about not meshing and so on.

556
00:28:13,641 --> 00:28:16,129
- Maybe she'll reconsider.
- And if she did?

557
00:28:17,034 --> 00:28:18,211
Then we could talk.

558
00:28:20,426 --> 00:28:22,979
Without a recommendation,
I really can't help you.

559
00:28:29,322 --> 00:28:30,304
Where am I going?

560
00:28:30,954 --> 00:28:32,710
To Radiology to take x-rays.

561
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:36,767
We'll use a machine called a CAT scan
to make sure your head's okay.

562
00:28:37,738 --> 00:28:38,567
I'm scared.

563
00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:41,188
It's okay.
I'll come with you.

564
00:28:46,985 --> 00:28:48,098
Hang on.

565
00:28:49,322 --> 00:28:50,783
Want me to get a rape kit?

566
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:53,417
I'm gonna talk to her
and see what happened.

567
00:29:03,434 --> 00:29:05,889
- Which bone would you choose?
- Maybe a finger.

568
00:29:06,122 --> 00:29:09,089
If I had to choose a bone to
break, I'd choose a clavicle.

569
00:29:09,354 --> 00:29:11,045
That's good.
No surgical intervention.

570
00:29:11,306 --> 00:29:14,721
- I'd go with a skull fracture.
- Oh, you would!

571
00:29:14,985 --> 00:29:16,033
Crazy!

572
00:29:16,297 --> 00:29:17,988
"Venture to Karachi on the rugged...

573
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:21,097
...Grand Trunk Road which,
while breathtaking...

574
00:29:21,353 --> 00:29:23,972
...is prone to landslides
and firefights...

575
00:29:24,233 --> 00:29:26,819
...by warring sectarian factions."

576
00:29:28,938 --> 00:29:29,985
Abby, don't go.

577
00:29:30,282 --> 00:29:32,289
Put the book down.

578
00:29:33,802 --> 00:29:34,663
Dr. Keaton?

579
00:29:34,954 --> 00:29:37,157
- Did you lock the door?
- I thought you did.

580
00:29:37,417 --> 00:29:38,345
Dr. Keaton, l...

581
00:29:43,338 --> 00:29:45,410
Peter, could you wait
outside, please?

582
00:29:55,786 --> 00:29:59,135
- Anything?
- Just doing the ink stain now.

583
00:29:59,401 --> 00:30:01,768
I admire you, Dr. Greene.
That took guts.

584
00:30:02,058 --> 00:30:03,684
Thank you for your support.

585
00:30:03,945 --> 00:30:07,840
Don't worry about that lawyer.
I'm going to take full responsibility.

586
00:30:08,106 --> 00:30:09,928
They can't fire all of us.

587
00:30:12,106 --> 00:30:16,448
Sorry if I offended you earlier
with that motorcycle crack.

588
00:30:16,746 --> 00:30:17,956
It takes a lot to offend me.

589
00:30:18,218 --> 00:30:22,887
But seriously, I'd be lucky
to find someone like you.

590
00:30:24,713 --> 00:30:26,274
Wanna get the lights?

591
00:30:36,937 --> 00:30:38,498
Is it meningitis?

592
00:30:39,721 --> 00:30:41,827
Cryptococcus.

593
00:30:42,058 --> 00:30:43,716
You were right.

594
00:30:55,466 --> 00:30:57,059
Randi, have you seen
a black binder?

595
00:30:57,290 --> 00:30:59,112
The nursing budget?

596
00:30:59,402 --> 00:31:01,704
It fell out of the cubby,
so I looked at it.

597
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:03,140
Well, where is it?

598
00:31:04,298 --> 00:31:05,956
Bad news for some people, huh?

599
00:31:06,218 --> 00:31:08,192
- You shouldn't have looked.
- I was curious.

600
00:31:08,458 --> 00:31:10,280
I took an accounting course.

601
00:31:10,537 --> 00:31:12,642
Well, that's no excuse.

602
00:31:15,626 --> 00:31:18,692
- It's the overtime that's killing you.
- What?

603
00:31:18,954 --> 00:31:22,249
ER nurses work 12-hour shifts.
After eight hours, they get overtime.

604
00:31:22,505 --> 00:31:25,734
- It's screwing with your budget.
- I don't know what else we can do.

605
00:31:25,993 --> 00:31:30,150
Put everybody on 8-hour shifts.
You'll save a hundred grand a year.

606
00:31:37,706 --> 00:31:41,667
I know teacher/intern relationships
can undermine reputations.

607
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:44,068
The innuendo and rumors.

608
00:31:45,066 --> 00:31:47,749
I need to know if you'll be
discreet about this.

609
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:51,206
I came by to see if you'd reconsider
writing me a recommendation.

610
00:31:53,514 --> 00:31:56,929
You've always complimented
my surgical skills...

611
00:31:57,194 --> 00:32:01,154
...and with a recommendation, I could
get another Pediatric rotation.

612
00:32:01,417 --> 00:32:02,432
And if I don't?

613
00:32:05,098 --> 00:32:06,472
What do you mean, if you don't?

614
00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:10,145
Will you report my relationship
with Dr. Carter?

615
00:32:12,329 --> 00:32:13,638
You think I'm threatening you?

616
00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:15,657
Are you?

617
00:32:19,561 --> 00:32:23,936
If your recommendation isn't based
on my abilities as a doctor...

618
00:32:24,809 --> 00:32:26,238
...I don't want it.

619
00:32:30,473 --> 00:32:32,197
I can't do that, Peter.

620
00:32:33,001 --> 00:32:36,482
You've got the makings
of an excellent surgeon...

621
00:32:36,745 --> 00:32:39,112
...but not a pediatric surgeon.

622
00:32:54,602 --> 00:32:57,471
Dr. Greene, another letter from Legal.

623
00:32:57,738 --> 00:33:00,356
What do you know?
I've been written up again.

624
00:33:00,618 --> 00:33:01,862
Twice in one night.

625
00:33:02,153 --> 00:33:04,390
They cc'd Anspaugh.
That was very thoughtful.

626
00:33:04,618 --> 00:33:05,381
Jerks.

627
00:33:05,641 --> 00:33:09,351
Why don't I just get some frames
and put these up on the wall?

628
00:33:09,610 --> 00:33:11,039
You should do it.

629
00:33:11,722 --> 00:33:14,591
- This is George Dunleavy.
- What can I do for you?

630
00:33:14,858 --> 00:33:17,891
The police said that you
may have found my sister, Shelly.

631
00:33:19,402 --> 00:33:21,638
A couple of days ago,
she said she was sick.

632
00:33:21,865 --> 00:33:23,294
I told her to see a doctor.

633
00:33:24,425 --> 00:33:26,432
I haven't heard from her since.

634
00:33:26,698 --> 00:33:29,153
Does your sister have any
psychiatric problems?

635
00:33:31,401 --> 00:33:33,474
She was pretty incoherent.

636
00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:36,258
Meningitis can cause
temporary dementia.

637
00:33:36,490 --> 00:33:37,919
Will she be all right?

638
00:33:38,185 --> 00:33:41,349
Take a day or two,
but she should be fine.

639
00:33:42,346 --> 00:33:44,517
- Thank you, doctor.
- Sure.

640
00:33:54,857 --> 00:33:58,370
I want you to know, Dr. Keaton
and I never talked about you.

641
00:33:58,633 --> 00:34:01,862
We never said anything about you
remotely negative, ever.

642
00:34:02,121 --> 00:34:05,187
Carter, it never occurred
to me that you had.

643
00:34:07,722 --> 00:34:09,631
We were just talking about you.

644
00:34:09,898 --> 00:34:13,760
Dr. Gant feels that you've treated
him inappropriately in public.

645
00:34:14,057 --> 00:34:16,959
Calling him lazy and stupid,
I understand?

646
00:34:17,225 --> 00:34:19,047
I said what he did
was lazy and stupid.

647
00:34:19,305 --> 00:34:22,567
It wasn't inappropriate.
His inattention almost killed a child.

648
00:34:22,857 --> 00:34:23,588
That's not true.

649
00:34:23,849 --> 00:34:24,798
You neglected your duties.

650
00:34:25,065 --> 00:34:27,847
If you feel that way, speak
to me. Don't yell at me in public.

651
00:34:28,105 --> 00:34:29,382
All right, settle down.

652
00:34:31,114 --> 00:34:32,543
You were there, weren't you?

653
00:34:33,578 --> 00:34:36,360
Do you feel Dr. Benton's reaction
was inappropriate?

654
00:34:40,618 --> 00:34:44,262
His language was strong, and I can
understand how Dennis feels.

655
00:34:46,185 --> 00:34:47,974
But given the circumstances...

656
00:34:49,161 --> 00:34:51,365
...I'm not sure
I'd call it inappropriate.

657
00:34:52,617 --> 00:34:56,033
Sounds like you have to
develop thicker skin, Dr. Gant.

658
00:34:56,297 --> 00:34:58,469
And if similar issues arise
in the future...

659
00:34:58,698 --> 00:35:01,862
...I suggest you take them up
with Dr. Benton directly...

660
00:35:02,153 --> 00:35:03,713
...before you come crying to me.

661
00:35:19,978 --> 00:35:23,971
The hard truth is, there's no money.
They want me to let people go.

662
00:35:24,266 --> 00:35:25,891
- So who gets fired?
- Nobody.

663
00:35:26,153 --> 00:35:29,797
I sent up a proposal that solves
our problems without losing jobs.

664
00:35:30,026 --> 00:35:32,098
- You cutting back hours?
- No.

665
00:35:32,361 --> 00:35:35,973
Instead of three 12-hour shifts,
everyone will work five 8-hour shifts.

666
00:35:36,234 --> 00:35:37,859
For the same money?

667
00:35:38,121 --> 00:35:39,233
A little less.

668
00:35:40,234 --> 00:35:43,103
But we have to work
four hours more a week.

669
00:35:43,370 --> 00:35:44,318
That sucks.

670
00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:46,788
Or two of you are history.

671
00:35:47,050 --> 00:35:48,806
- I don't buy that.
- They got the money.

672
00:35:49,066 --> 00:35:50,953
I'm not giving up my OT.

673
00:35:51,209 --> 00:35:54,176
None of us are. We got a contract
negotiation coming up.

674
00:35:54,409 --> 00:35:56,231
Management pulls this, we walk.

675
00:35:56,489 --> 00:35:57,984
That's right.

676
00:36:15,817 --> 00:36:18,053
I didn't think you'd
really go to Anspaugh.

677
00:36:18,857 --> 00:36:20,286
Look, I'm sorry.

678
00:36:20,521 --> 00:36:21,568
Don't worry about it.

679
00:36:22,218 --> 00:36:25,152
I didn't know what to say.
And with Benton standing there...

680
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:28,003
John, it's okay. I didn't mean
to put you on the spot.

681
00:36:30,985 --> 00:36:32,098
So we're cool?

682
00:36:32,874 --> 00:36:34,400
Yeah, we're cool.

683
00:36:36,425 --> 00:36:39,043
I'd better get back to the ER.
I'll see you later.

684
00:36:54,825 --> 00:36:59,495
It's like an x-ray of your head.
There's nothing to be afraid of.

685
00:37:00,874 --> 00:37:03,721
- Will you stay with me?
- I'm gonna be in the next room.

686
00:37:07,913 --> 00:37:09,604
Charlie, were you raped?

687
00:37:13,865 --> 00:37:15,687
Promise you won't tell the cops?

688
00:37:15,978 --> 00:37:17,800
I'm not gonna tell anybody.

689
00:37:27,913 --> 00:37:28,774
You'll be okay.

690
00:37:30,057 --> 00:37:31,137
Here we go.

691
00:37:36,073 --> 00:37:37,502
Okay, let's see.

692
00:37:42,825 --> 00:37:44,897
Hey, Mark! Mark!

693
00:37:47,017 --> 00:37:48,926
You forgot your curriculum vitae.

694
00:37:49,226 --> 00:37:50,655
Thanks!

695
00:37:50,921 --> 00:37:54,085
After tonight, I figure my chances
for making tenure are about nil.

696
00:37:54,345 --> 00:37:56,767
But I did my job,
and I can do my job somewhere.

697
00:37:57,033 --> 00:37:58,724
- Tenure or no tenure.
- Same here.

698
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:01,603
They're messing with our overtime.
I'll go someplace else.

699
00:38:01,865 --> 00:38:03,872
- That's the spirit!
- I gotta go.

700
00:38:04,169 --> 00:38:07,104
Chuny, you hungry?
Wanna grab some breakfast with me?

701
00:38:07,561 --> 00:38:08,292
Sure.

702
00:38:08,553 --> 00:38:12,230
First I gotta take the bike for
a spin just to charge the battery.

703
00:38:12,457 --> 00:38:14,083
Why don't I charge it up with you?

704
00:38:14,345 --> 00:38:15,970
Sure. Hop on!

705
00:38:26,601 --> 00:38:27,878
You want me to get in this box?

706
00:38:28,169 --> 00:38:30,111
"This box" is a body plethysmograph.

707
00:38:30,377 --> 00:38:33,639
- It accurately measures lung capacity.
- Why is that important?

708
00:38:33,898 --> 00:38:37,159
I need accurate specifications,
or I can't correlate the data.

709
00:38:37,385 --> 00:38:38,629
I'm sorry.
I get claustrophobic.

710
00:38:38,921 --> 00:38:40,743
Look at all the windows.
You can look out.

711
00:38:40,970 --> 00:38:42,213
I'm sorry. I can't.

712
00:38:42,441 --> 00:38:45,507
If you don't, I have to
throw out two months' work.

713
00:38:45,801 --> 00:38:47,459
- I'm not getting in.
- You're getting $50.

714
00:38:47,721 --> 00:38:48,736
- Shut up.
- Please?

715
00:38:49,002 --> 00:38:50,758
I'm sorry. It's final.
I can't.

716
00:38:51,945 --> 00:38:53,374
How about that?

717
00:38:53,641 --> 00:38:54,721
- Wendy.
- What?

718
00:38:55,018 --> 00:38:56,228
- Get in the box.
- Me?

719
00:38:56,457 --> 00:38:58,846
We'll test lung volume.
Then get on the bike.

720
00:38:59,113 --> 00:39:00,454
But it's almost daylight.

721
00:39:00,745 --> 00:39:03,745
Here, wear the goggles.
You won't know the difference.

722
00:39:09,705 --> 00:39:10,949
How is she?

723
00:39:12,809 --> 00:39:16,486
She's got a broken arm,
a lot of bruises.

724
00:39:17,225 --> 00:39:19,527
A concussion. She was raped.

725
00:39:19,785 --> 00:39:21,410
I'll get a kit
and call the police.

726
00:39:21,673 --> 00:39:23,266
When does the social worker
get here?

727
00:39:23,529 --> 00:39:26,049
They should be on now.
You want me to call?

728
00:39:29,865 --> 00:39:31,491
No. I'll do it.

729
00:39:49,482 --> 00:39:51,270
The eggs are burning.

730
00:39:52,137 --> 00:39:55,749
Oh, well. We'll just have
to make some more.

731
00:40:00,137 --> 00:40:01,185
I didn't call a surgeon.

732
00:40:01,449 --> 00:40:04,962
We finally got a good one.
Some guy got hit by the EI.

733
00:40:06,857 --> 00:40:09,378
- What you got?
- You got a mess. Take a look.

734
00:40:10,921 --> 00:40:12,382
Yuck! Which end is up?

735
00:40:12,617 --> 00:40:14,243
Jumped or fell in front of a train.

736
00:40:14,505 --> 00:40:17,636
Open skull fracture, multiple
extremity fractures, flailed chest.

737
00:40:17,897 --> 00:40:20,068
- Any signs of life?
- He's got a weak pulse.

738
00:40:20,329 --> 00:40:22,216
Now all he needs is a face.

739
00:40:23,785 --> 00:40:26,174
He's 60/40.
He ain't gonna last.

740
00:40:26,441 --> 00:40:28,830
Everybody, grab hold
on my count. 1, 2, 3!

741
00:40:29,098 --> 00:40:31,464
- What is this?
- Man versus moving El train.

742
00:40:31,721 --> 00:40:32,649
Suicide?

743
00:40:32,938 --> 00:40:34,498
He either jumped or tripped.

744
00:40:34,761 --> 00:40:35,524
Lost the pulse.

745
00:40:35,785 --> 00:40:38,119
Put O-neg on the rapid infuser.
Set up a central line.

746
00:40:38,345 --> 00:40:40,450
Page Gant. He's supposed to be
covering the ER.

747
00:40:40,745 --> 00:40:42,632
- I'll do it.
- How are his eyes?

748
00:40:42,889 --> 00:40:44,712
He's lost one,
and the other's swollen shut.

749
00:40:44,937 --> 00:40:46,311
Gray matter in the hair.

750
00:40:46,601 --> 00:40:47,681
Increased breath sounds.

751
00:40:47,913 --> 00:40:48,742
I'll put in a tube.

752
00:40:49,001 --> 00:40:50,311
It's a surgical procedure.

753
00:40:50,569 --> 00:40:51,998
- 32 French.
- Whose beeper?

754
00:40:52,265 --> 00:40:53,247
It's coming from him.

755
00:40:53,513 --> 00:40:55,553
- 10 blade.
- What number did you page Gant to?

756
00:40:55,817 --> 00:40:57,312
This room, 3376.

757
00:40:57,577 --> 00:40:59,170
That's the number on this pager.

758
00:41:01,257 --> 00:41:03,199
Oh, my God! The patient.

759
00:41:03,625 --> 00:41:05,119
It's Gant.

760
00:41:06,793 --> 00:41:07,905
Dennis?

761
00:41:09,769 --> 00:41:11,111
Oh, sweet Jesus!

762
00:41:11,401 --> 00:41:12,710
Carter, put the tube in!

763
00:41:13,481 --> 00:41:14,659
Seal him with thoraseal!
Move!

764
00:41:16,361 --> 00:41:18,695
- Flat line.
- Give me an amp of epi...

765
00:41:18,953 --> 00:41:21,026
...and atropine.
Let's go, Carter!

766
00:41:21,257 --> 00:41:22,205
I'm trying!

767
00:41:22,441 --> 00:41:24,099
Get it in! Get it in!

768
00:41:24,393 --> 00:41:25,440
It's in.

769
00:41:28,969 --> 00:41:30,082
Come on.
