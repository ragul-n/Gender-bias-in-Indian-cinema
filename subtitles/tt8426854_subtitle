1
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:45,330
Last night I just
wanted to kill myself.

2
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,080
Seemed like there's
no point to all this.

3
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,080
But then your face
flashed before my eyes.

4
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:13,120
What will you do without me?

5
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,450
Ayesha dear,
life is not like one of your books...

6
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,830
...where you can put a
full stop whenever you want.

7
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:21,580
No.

8
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,830
No, dear.

9
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,830
If you didn't want to get married,
you could've just told me.

10
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:29,000
It's been 7-years since that incident.

11
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,370
7-goddamn-years, Ayesha.

12
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,040
What is wrong with you?

13
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:38,620
How long can you live alone?

14
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,540
I am growing old.

15
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,540
- I can just...
- Yesterday, when I was getting ready.

16
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,160
Everyone around me was so happy.

17
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:58,540
But to me,
it was more like a commotion.

18
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:04,830
Actually, I was feeling so suffocated,
that it was getting difficult to breathe.

19
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:13,000
My entire life revolves
around this one question...

20
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:17,200
- ...that why didn't he show up, papa?
- Ayesha, no.

21
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:18,370
No, dear.

22
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:20,500
- Why didn't he show up, papa?
- Enough, dear.

23
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:21,290
Stop it.

24
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:25,160
Nothing happened. Nothing happened.

25
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,700
- Nothing happened.
- I am sorry.

26
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,040
- I am sorry. I am sorry, papa.
- No, no.

27
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,750
- I let you down.
- No, no.

28
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:32,830
- I couldn't go through with it.
- No.

29
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,410
I am so sorry.

30
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:36,450
It doesn't matter to me what
the people are going to think.

31
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,620
Just tell me...

32
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:41,370
Tell me what you want from life.

33
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:42,750
Tell me.

34
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:45,250
Papa...

35
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:49,620
I...

36
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:54,410
I want to go far away from
this atmosphere, and this situation.

37
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,080
- Can you give me 24 hours, please?
- Of course, dear.

38
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:01,410
Of course. Why not?

39
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:02,700
Just tell me where you want to go.

40
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:04,830
I'll book flight tickets right now.

41
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:05,540
Just...

42
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:09,500
Just cancel your book
reading session in Delhi.

43
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:13,500
No-no, papa. That's important.

44
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,080
How long will I keep
running from my past?

45
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:23,950
Please.

46
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:26,080
Please.

47
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:46,410
Am I talking to the one-book
wonder with a broken heart...

48
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,790
...who lived happily ever after.

49
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:49,580
Yes, you are.

50
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:52,660
I heard that you broke
your engagement with Samir.

51
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:54,950
Marriage is not for me.

52
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:58,040
I cannot make the same mistake again.

53
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:01,250
If you don't want to get married,
then start your next book.

54
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:02,910
I can't do it.

55
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,330
Whenever I open my laptop, I find
myself in the same situation again.

56
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:10,290
That same question...

57
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:13,700
The truth is Ayesha...
he never loved you.

58
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:16,870
He never loved you.

59
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:22,500
She hung up on me.

60
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:35,080
Yes, mom.

61
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,160
Dear, dear...

62
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:37,580
Yes, of course, mom.

63
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,160
Okay, let's go then.

64
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:41,250
Come on.

65
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:03,200
Mom.

66
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,250
Mom.

67
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:07,830
Mom.

68
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,750
Pulti, if you don't come now
then I'll leave you on the station.

69
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,120
- But mom, my shoe...
- What shoe?

70
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,540
The lace has come undone again.

71
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:20,910
How do your laces
come undone all the time?

72
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,290
You must be fiddling around with it.

73
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:23,700
I've told you a thousand times...

74
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:25,500
And you're laughing.

75
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:26,500
Come on, move.

76
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:39,620
S***

77
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:41,000
Cigarettes, man.

78
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:43,500
Pradhan.

79
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:44,540
Mrs. Pradhan.

80
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:45,500
Miss...

81
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:47,330
Oh, sorry.

82
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:48,500
Ms. Ayesha Pradhan.

83
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:50,750
- Seat no. 15.
- Is there a problem?

84
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,910
No problem, madam.
Just a small request.

85
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:57,500
What request?

86
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:00,370
- This is Mr. and Missus. Singh.
- Hello.

87
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:01,370
Newly married couple.

88
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:05,910
Their problem is that they booked
their tickets for a two-berth coup.

89
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,870
And for some reason, they
were allotted a four-sharing coup.

90
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,040
Well, this can be a system
error or maybe their agent.

91
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,450
But their first
journey's been spoiled.

92
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:18,000
So we had a request if you could...

93
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:19,700
Please, madam.

94
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,580
Okay.

95
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:22,830
Okay, madam.

96
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:23,500
Thank you, madam.

97
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:24,450
Very cooperative.

98
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:25,830
Say thank you to her.

99
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,160
Thank you.

100
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:28,120
I kept the keys on the fridge.

101
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:28,910
Please come, madam.

102
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,580
Please.

103
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:31,580
Yes, we've settled down.

104
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:32,950
No, there's no problem.

105
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,000
Yes, we're comfortable.

106
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:36,660
Yes, of course.

107
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:37,870
We'll leave as soon
as the train departs.

108
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:40,040
The same old, train special.

109
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:43,700
- Potatoes and bread.
- Mutton kebabs. And sweetmeat.

110
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:47,620
She knows everything.

111
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:49,000
No-no.

112
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:49,790
Yeah...

113
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:58,200
You keep it.

114
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:03,450
Passenger no. 4?

115
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:07,250
There he is.

116
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:09,040
Great.

117
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:10,950
Will he need a blanket?

118
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:13,910
Right away.

119
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:17,620
Devdas is laughing.

120
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:19,750
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

121
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:41,620
Anu.

122
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:43,870
Sorry.

123
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,540
My name is Anu. I am Anu.

124
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:48,250
Ayesha.

125
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:50,620
Ayesha... Anu.

126
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,830
A... A... What a coincidence.

127
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:55,290
Isn't it, dear?

128
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,620
And this is my daughter Pulti.

129
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,330
Pulti, say hi to aunty.

130
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:02,200
Hi, aunty.

131
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:03,830
Hi.

132
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,410
Actually, since the time we left home,
from Malad...

133
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:14,910
...I need to go to the toilet.

134
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:16,870
But you know, Pulti...

135
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:21,120
Can you look after
her for a minute, please?

136
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:22,580
I'll be right back.

137
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:23,290
Thanks.

138
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:31,700
Do you know why my name is Pulti?

139
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:32,620
Why?

140
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:35,500
Because I am always
up to some mischief.

141
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:38,290
But my father always...

142
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:40,870
Do you want to play a game?

143
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:42,870
Which one?

144
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:47,540
Can you kiss your elbow?

145
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:50,620
Yes.

146
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:51,540
Show.

147
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:08,000
Mummy.

148
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,000
- Mummy.
- What happened?

149
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,370
The train is leaving.

150
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,750
Your mom's in the bathroom.

151
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:13,580
Mummy...

152
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,250
- Pulti.
- Mummy...

153
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,160
Pulti.

154
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,950
- Mom, where were you?
- Why are you so worried?

155
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,950
- I was right here, dear. On the train.
- Excuse me.

156
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,250
Sorry.

157
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,750
Dear, I am sorry, I am sorry.

158
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,950
I hope she didn't
trouble you too much.

159
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:27,700
No.

160
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:29,500
- Mom...
- I am sorry.

161
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,540
- Thank you so much.
- No problem.

162
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:33,040
- Shall we talk to papa?
- No.

163
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:54,370
Thank you.

164
00:10:59,120 --> 00:10:59,790
Are you okay?

165
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:01,870
Yeah.

166
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:06,370
You look sad.

167
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:09,910
Takes one to know one.

168
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:13,870
Keep it.

169
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:25,360
Yes.

170
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:26,530
Yes, the train has left.

171
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:28,110
No, it's a lady.

172
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:30,280
Pulti is getting along
with her really well.

173
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:31,530
Yes.

174
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:32,780
We'll eat in a while.

175
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,360
Just a second. Talk to Pulti.

176
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:36,200
Say hello to papa.

177
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,450
Mom, how much longer
are you going to talk?

178
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:38,740
I am hungry.

179
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:40,110
Just two minutes, dear.

180
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:40,990
I'll give you. Just two minutes.

181
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:41,740
Please.

182
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:44,990
Dev, can I call you
after we've eaten, please.

183
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:47,650
You know she will start
lecturing me otherwise.

184
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:49,200
Okay, bye.

185
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,450
I'll serve your food, okay.

186
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,950
You were talking to Arjun, weren't you

187
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:58,150
What?

188
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:58,990
Arjun.

189
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:01,280
He looks fairer on TV.

190
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:06,650
You know, I spent a lot of money
to make him win the grand finale.

191
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:08,570
I used to vote on every episode.

192
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:09,650
Madness.

193
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:13,280
Tell me something, shall I serve your
food on a plate or will you help yourself?

194
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,030
No lunch, but thank you.

195
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:17,110
What happened, dear?

196
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,070
Thank you.

197
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:23,990
Wow...

198
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:27,360
You know, kebabs are her favorite.

199
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,240
She never shares it with anyone.

200
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:30,950
I think she likes you.

201
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:37,780
Actually, my sister-in-law
can cook only three things.

202
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:39,740
So whenever anyone
is traveling by train...

203
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:40,950
...she makes all three dishes.

204
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,240
Without even asking.

205
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,360
Actually, her father-in-law
just had a by-pass surgery.

206
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:49,280
So she was in a lot of trouble.

207
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,280
Her baby's just 8 months old.

208
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,400
So I just stayed with her for a month.

209
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:56,990
And, even my mother stayed
with her for a month before this.

210
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:02,110
Your mother stayed
with your sister-in-law?

211
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:06,530
Oh, no...my parents live in Roorki.

212
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,200
My mother-in-law.

213
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:09,570
Ohh...

214
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,490
Honestly, she is very supportive.

215
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:16,740
When she's around things
become very easy for me.

216
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:21,030
Where are you going?
Are you from Delhi?

217
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:23,030
Mumbai.

218
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:25,990
I see...so why are you going to Delhi?

219
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,610
I have a book-reading session.

220
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:31,150
You're going to Delhi to read a book.

221
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,650
I wrote that book.

222
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:36,150
Ohh...

223
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,570
So, you're a writer.

224
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:38,400
Nice.

225
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:39,900
Where in Delhi?

226
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,070
Def-Col.

227
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:42,950
Defense Colony.

228
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:43,700
Yeah...

229
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:44,700
I see...

230
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:47,070
We stay in Old Delhi.

231
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:49,650
Actually, my husband's family has
been living there from the beginning.

232
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,570
Our house is very famous in that area.

233
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:55,780
In fact, now that area
is known by our name.

234
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,280
Netaji's Manor.

235
00:13:58,110 --> 00:13:59,280
Do come over someday.

236
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,240
It's a great place...

237
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,200
Pulti. What happened?

238
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,570
- Mom...
- It's just a tunnel, dear.

239
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:06,320
It's okay.

240
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,070
Mom's here.

241
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:09,820
Don't be scared.

242
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:12,110
And you're a brave kid.

243
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:17,570
The heart of Old Delhi, this
is Netaji's manor, and it's heart...

244
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:24,400
...still beats...with our breath.

245
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,400
And these are one of
those remaining manors...

246
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:29,900
...which wasn't deserted
by the families living in it.

247
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,860
Guys welcome to my home.

248
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:35,570
Okay, guys,
that's my younger sister Renu.

249
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,740
India's Rising future star.

250
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:40,200
FIne. Rising future superstar.

251
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:41,450
Okay... whoa...

252
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,240
More importantly.

253
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,070
Do you see these walls?

254
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:49,450
These bricks were laid in 1858.

255
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,200
But...

256
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:52,900
- He's so cute.
- What are you doing?

257
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:55,450
Each brick is still
as young as before.

258
00:14:56,950 --> 00:14:57,610
Every...

259
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:58,780
What's wrong with you?

260
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,740
- Each stone...
- What?

261
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,450
Each stone has a story.

262
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:11,740
- Can you hear it?
- Yeah.

263
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:12,740
Come on.

264
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,900
Okay, guys, everyone follow me.

265
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:17,900
And walk carefully.

266
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:19,240
Somebody better ask a question.

267
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,990
And, these railings
are absolutely solid.

268
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:21,780
They are carved.

269
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:24,030
Walk carefully, one-by-one.

270
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:25,360
And this is the first floor.

271
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:29,780
And, everything on
this floor is antique.

272
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:33,860
And this particular painting behind
you used to be my grandpa's favorite...

273
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:36,360
...because it belongs to 1857...

274
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:37,820
When the war broke out.

275
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:40,030
There was a huge
revolution back there.

276
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:42,240
- What?
- A revolution at every level.

277
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:45,860
I came here to write my book,
and not to flirt around like you.

278
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:46,450
Exactly

279
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:47,240
- Exactly
- Come on.

280
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:48,030
That's it.

281
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:51,570
So since that time, till today...

282
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:59,320
So as promised friends, this tour had to
end with a traditional Mathur family meal.

283
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:03,820
So, I would like to introduce
you guys to the chef.

284
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:05,360
And my mom...

285
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:09,820
Mrs. Kamla Mathur.

286
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:13,740
Come on, guys.

287
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:17,860
So this is our family's
special mint chutney.

288
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:18,740
Mint chutney.

289
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:21,950
It's got coriander leaves,
garlic, ginger.

290
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:23,110
He's hot.

291
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,530
...there's a special way to eat it.

292
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:26,400
I'll tell you how to eat it.

293
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:29,820
So basically,
you have to dip it into the chutney.

294
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,280
He's not.

295
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,320
He is hot.

296
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:37,650
He's not.

297
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:38,700
He is hot!

298
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:40,700
Can I help you?

299
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:42,700
Hot.

300
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:45,700
It's very hot.

301
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:47,240
The food.
- Okay.

302
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,200
Drink some water.

303
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:50,240
Why Netaji's Manor?

304
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:52,900
Was there a famous
leader in your family?

305
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,610
- So...
- This house was earlier...

306
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:55,900
...called Mathur Niwas.

307
00:16:56,610 --> 00:17:00,200
But since Netaji came to live here,
this name became permanent.

308
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:03,110
- Netaji?
- Yeah, you see...

309
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:08,200
Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose.

310
00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:10,650
There he goes again.

311
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:16,950
It was the night of 16th December.

312
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:24,360
The aroma of sweet potatoes
and Independence was in the air.

313
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:31,570
Netaji had to travel to Afghanistan.

314
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,900
He had to save himself from
the enemies prying eyes for one night.

315
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:40,900
And then...

316
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:45,070
Baburam knocked on our door.

317
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,030
No, he didn't come to
sell his soft milk sweets.

318
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:53,200
He brought Netaji Subhash
Chandra Bose along.

319
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,280
Brother, Flatbreads.

320
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:57,200
Since then Mathur Niwas
became Netaji's Manor.

321
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:59,610
Are you some kind of a history buff?

322
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:01,820
Brother is Ph.D.

323
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:07,900
Within two years, he was promoted from asst.
professor to senior professor of history.

324
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:14,780
But you see, my brother loved
the old relics more than his salary.

325
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:17,150
Mom, what did brother used to say?

326
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:23,070
- The walls of the Red Fort...
- Reek of history.

327
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:25,030
Silly boy.

328
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:31,490
You see...a man's choices
make him what he is.

329
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:35,280
Isn't that what Papa used to say,
Mrs. Mathur?

330
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:41,240
And, if I hadn't chosen this,
then I would've never met you guys.

331
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:44,110
As I said, he's hot.

332
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:48,490
And you guys would've
never seen Netaji's Manor.

333
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:13,450
Anaida.

334
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:14,400
Anaida.

335
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:15,780
Pick up the phone.

336
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:19,030
Please, Anaida.

337
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:22,150
He used to love her a lot.

338
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:27,400
Arjun became a fan of Queen,
Metallica, and AC DC later.

339
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:30,280
Silly boy bowled her over
singing Kumar Sanu's songs.

340
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:30,950
Seriously, bro.

341
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:32,200
Which song did he sing?

342
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:36,650
"Just like one needs
to breathe...to stay alive..."

343
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:37,450
Oh, retro.

344
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:43,860
"Just like one needs
to breathe...to stay alive..."

345
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:50,990
"All I need is a sweetheart,
to fall in love."

346
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,450
- Hi.
- Hi.

347
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:10,650
Hey.

348
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:12,490
Oh, hi.

349
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:13,860
What are you doing here?

350
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:16,530
I want to talk to you.

351
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:18,900
Ohh...but my walk's
going to begin shortly, so...

352
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:20,820
Right. I know. I booked it.

353
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:21,780
Again.

354
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:25,700
If you're so in love with Delhi,
then I'll recommend you a book.

355
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:28,530
Raza Rumi's Delhi by Heart.

356
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:31,400
It will happen with Delhi as well.

357
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,650
The others will be here soon.

358
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:36,200
No one's coming.

359
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,070
Sorry.

360
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:39,280
It's just me.

361
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:39,990
No.

362
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:44,200
- There's Lara, Gaby, Sheila...
- Setu, Tike, Ranu.

363
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:45,950
All me.

364
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:48,030
You're completely crazy.

365
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:50,700
I mean not crazy, crazy.

366
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:54,200
But I want to be a writer,
so a little build up is necessary.

367
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,240
Can we sit and talk?

368
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:08,610
- Hello, uncle.
- Hello, son.

369
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:10,740
Do you like these cropped up lanes?

370
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:12,740
A lot.

371
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:18,110
See it from my point of view.

372
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:23,030
Everything is close.

373
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:27,450
Like they are asking
about each other's well-being.

374
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:34,070
Old homes, but connected roofs,
over-grown parapets.

375
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:37,150
And the commotion.

376
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:41,200
Aroma of spices.

377
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:43,110
- And...
- And?

378
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:49,070
And that boiling tea,
the extra-sweet syrup...

379
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:51,990
...that aunty with the
betel leaf and that balloon man.

380
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:56,530
These are not cropped up lanes.
This is my home.

381
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:01,070
How do you make
everything so beautiful?

382
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,490
Well...

383
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:06,200
It's because of my dad.

384
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:10,570
He used to give me a tour of these lanes
every day carrying me on his shoulder.

385
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:12,490
And every Sunday...

386
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:15,530
...he would take me to these monuments
and tell me about their history.

387
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:20,240
And you know,
even today when I conduct these tours...

388
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:23,360
...and try to indulge the people
in my world, and tell them my story...

389
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:26,110
...I feel like my dad is with me.

390
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:29,240
And that feeling makes
me feel alive again.

391
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:35,200
Come here, come here.

392
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:36,820
Smile.

393
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:40,320
Phones often get lost.

394
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:43,150
- This will be with me forever.
- Okay.

395
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,700
You think I am crazy, right?

396
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:47,240
No.

397
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:49,610
- Just a little.
- Why?

398
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:53,780
Well, you're going
sightseeing with a stranger.

399
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:55,570
You got to be a little
crazy to do that.

400
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:56,530
Why stranger?

401
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:59,900
Name; Dev Mathur.
Address; Netaji's Manor.

402
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:02,700
Okay.

403
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:08,740
- Can we take that walk again?
- Yeah, sure.

404
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,110
Come on.

405
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:19,280
"If you don't hold my hands..."

406
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:22,860
"...where else will I go."

407
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:27,360
"I am sure you know..."

408
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:30,990
"...that I am all yours."

409
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:38,950
"Our match...is made in Heaven."

410
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:45,200
"That's why we met on Earth,
isn't it?"

411
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:52,200
"I'm seeking refuge in your arms."

412
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:56,150
"Make me just like you are."

413
00:23:56,360 --> 00:24:00,110
"If I ever get lost..."

414
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:04,400
"...find me and bring me back."

415
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:08,280
"I'm seeking refuge in your arms."

416
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:12,070
"Make me just like you are."

417
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:15,950
"If I ever get lost..."

418
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:20,360
"...find me and bring me back."

419
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,740
"When you arrive..."

420
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:34,990
"...I pray that you never leave again."

421
00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:39,400
"When you're not in front of me..."

422
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:42,900
"...my heart gets restless."

423
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:51,150
"Let's sit together...and
time stands still."

424
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:59,280
"The grace of love
is visible...for you and me."

425
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:07,240
"Our match...is made in Heaven."

426
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:13,240
"That's why we met on Earth,
isn't it?"

427
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:20,240
"I'm seeking refuge in your arms."

428
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:24,150
"Make me just like you are."

429
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:28,150
"If I ever get lost..."

430
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:32,240
"...find me and bring me back."

431
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:36,200
"I'm seeking refuge in your arms."

432
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:40,240
"Make me just like you are."

433
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:44,240
"If I ever get lost..."

434
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:48,400
"...find me and bring me back."

435
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:51,860
"Oh yes, please do."

436
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:05,280
"Destiny has...brought you to me."

437
00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:13,450
"But I hope our destiny doesn't
take us on a separate journey."

438
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:21,650
"Let's live an entire
lifetime in this moment."

439
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:29,110
"Two lines may become
strangers again."

440
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:36,990
"Our match...is made in Heaven."

441
00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:43,200
"That's why we met on Earth,
isn't it?"

442
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:50,150
"I'm seeking refuge in your arms."

443
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:54,240
"Make me just like you are."

444
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:58,240
"If I ever get lost..."

445
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:02,530
"...find me and bring me back."

446
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:06,200
"I'm seeking refuge in your arms."

447
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:09,700
"Make me just like you are."

448
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:14,240
"If I ever get lost..."

449
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:18,450
"...find me and bring me back."

450
00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:21,700
"Oh yes, please do."

451
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:37,990
I am good at keeping in touch, huh.

452
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:40,530
So don't miss me.

453
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:46,240
Fine, I won't...miss you.

454
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:52,110
My Jalebi.

455
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:57,780
Do I look like a Jalebi to you?

456
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:00,950
No.

457
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:06,740
But you're just as sweet.

458
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:08,990
S***

459
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,150
S***

460
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,490
Anaida.

461
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:42,820
Anaida, listen.

462
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:47,610
You won't believe what happened to me?

463
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:52,740
Dev...

464
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:54,150
Dev...

465
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:55,780
Dev's wife.

466
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:01,030
I am sharing the
cabin with Dev's wife.

467
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:12,740
And listen Anaida, it's not just the wife
but his 7-year-old daughter as well.

468
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:14,200
7-years.

469
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:21,280
I don't know what to do.

470
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,030
No, no, no.

471
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,070
No!

472
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,030
My heart doesn't accept it.

473
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,450
How can I be so wrong?

474
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:43,700
He loved me.

475
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:46,360
He loved me, right.

476
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:52,320
I need to know.

477
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:55,990
I need to know, man. I need to know.

478
00:29:58,530 --> 00:29:59,530
I don't know.

479
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:02,110
I don't know.

480
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,400
I need to know.

481
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:07,990
Anaida?

482
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:09,900
Anaida?

483
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:12,700
Anaida?

484
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:07,450
Can you please change my cabin?

485
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,450
Any problem, madam?

486
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:13,150
But I want to change.

487
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,280
Give me 10 minutes.

488
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,820
We'll be arriving
in Kalyan Station soon.

489
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:18,990
I'll check and tell you.

490
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:20,570
Thank you.

491
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:37,560
"Your attention please passengers."

492
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:55,060
- Hurry up.
- Coming.

493
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:56,310
It's not this one.

494
00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:02,150
My, God.

495
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:05,940
- Is she your daughter?
- Yes.

496
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,810
- Pulti, say hi to aunty.
- Hi.

497
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:09,600
Hi.

498
00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:11,690
My Faizu.

499
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,560
Faizal. My grandson.

500
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:15,900
He's the same age.

501
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,690
He lives with his
mom and dad in America.

502
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,480
Wow! American grandson.

503
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:24,230
Uh, ho...what have you said, dear?

504
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,100
That's her biggest fear.

505
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,440
That her grandson
might become an America.

506
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:30,940
Whether we Delhiites
go to America or Africa.

507
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:32,690
But we stay remain Delhiites, aunty.

508
00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:34,350
Absolutely right.

509
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,150
That's not my fear.

510
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:39,520
I fear that he will forget us.

511
00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:42,270
Then dear,
then you show some generosity...

512
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:45,100
...and you remember
him on his behalf too.

513
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:45,770
Then you both will be happy.

514
00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:46,770
Forget it.

515
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:48,940
We're in the next cabin.

516
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:50,190
Come over, okay.

517
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:51,980
You're too much.

518
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:54,310
- Always joking about everything.
- Bless you.

519
00:32:54,650 --> 00:32:58,600
Tell me something,
will you marry me next time?

520
00:32:59,150 --> 00:32:59,850
Huh?

521
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,230
What kind of an answer was that?

522
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:07,770
Was it a yes or...just a question?

523
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:19,810
Stop.

524
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:23,150
What is she doing?

525
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:25,770
Who do you want so
early in the morning?

526
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:28,810
Hi.

527
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:30,100
Hello.

528
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:31,810
I had a question for you.

529
00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:33,020
What?

530
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:36,400
I want to marry you.

531
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,310
Huh?

532
00:33:37,770 --> 00:33:39,650
Was that a yes or
a rhetorical question?

533
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:40,350
Hurry up.

534
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,350
I haven't unloaded my bags yet.

535
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,770
Or else I'll head back to Mumbai.

536
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:52,480
If you can't say yes
can I say yes to her?

537
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:55,650
This call for some sweets.
Times are changing.

538
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:06,600
Madam. Hello, madam.

539
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:11,100
2nd and 3rd Ac are
completely full too.

540
00:34:12,810 --> 00:34:16,600
If you're having trouble
adjusting with the kid in the cabin...

541
00:34:17,310 --> 00:34:18,810
...then you can take my berth.

542
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:23,690
If you stand here like this,
then I won't feel nice.

543
00:34:25,350 --> 00:34:27,020
This is my home.

544
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,850
I can lie down anywhere I want.

545
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:34,440
Thank you.

546
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:58,730
'Last night I wanted to kill myself.'

547
00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:02,650
'Why didn't he show up, papa?'

548
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:04,900
'He never loved me.'

549
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:07,150
'Last night I wanted to kill myself.'

550
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:10,350
'That two-timer was
using you the whole time.'

551
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,310
'He never loved you.'

552
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:21,440
Aren't they a really nice old couple?

553
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:23,600
The happy-ever-after kind.

554
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,350
And people always spread
rumors that marriages don't last.

555
00:35:28,650 --> 00:35:29,190
Isn't it?

556
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:37,770
By the way,
if it wasn't for these marriages...

557
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:41,730
...then living alone in old-age
would be so difficult, isn't it?

558
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:46,150
It's difficult to
stay alone at any age.

559
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:53,100
And who told people don't
feel lonely even after marriages?

560
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,100
Right.

561
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:07,150
Loneliness never leaves
your side like your shadow.

562
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:17,690
I will never let Pulti leave me ever.

563
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:23,100
And your husband?

564
00:36:25,770 --> 00:36:28,020
He wouldn't even let her go to school.

565
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:32,310
You know, he's been to
Mumbai twice in one month.

566
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,020
Only to see Pulti.

567
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:36,100
- How sweet.
- Yeah.

568
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:40,190
Normally he's always
talking about Old Delhi.

569
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:44,810
But when he doesn't see Pulti,
that same house feels like jail.

570
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:49,600
His home is wherever I and Pulti are.

571
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,600
Like they say...

572
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:55,900
Home is Where your Heart is.

573
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,480
"Moment..."

574
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:51,520
"Everything stopped in a moment."

575
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:58,600
"When you held my hand with yours."

576
00:37:58,690 --> 00:38:02,100
"You go wherever I go."

577
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:05,690
"You're always by my side when I look.

578
00:38:05,770 --> 00:38:09,650
"I am the season
and you're the breeze."

579
00:38:09,730 --> 00:38:12,400
"Sweetheart."

580
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:16,440
"I laugh when you sing."

581
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:19,900
"I cry when you wither away."

582
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:23,980
"I get drenched in
the shower of your love."

583
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:27,060
"Sweetheart."

584
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:47,100
"My shadow looks just like you."

585
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:48,900
Come out, the guests are here.

586
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:54,690
"My condition is such these days..."

587
00:38:55,770 --> 00:38:59,440
"If I am the dawn,
you're the rays of the sun."

588
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:03,020
"If I am the mirror,
you're the image."

589
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:09,440
"Your company is so loving,
O companion."

590
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:17,400
"You gave me the colors of love."

591
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,440
Dev...

592
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:24,350
- "And pulled me towards yourself."
- Dev...

593
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:28,060
"Let's get lost somewhere..."

594
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:31,520
"...where this time stops forever."

595
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:35,650
"And tomorrow never comes."

596
00:39:35,730 --> 00:39:37,900
"Sweetheart."

597
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:06,020
I am getting very bored at home.

598
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:08,520
- Let's go somewhere.
- Where?

599
00:40:10,270 --> 00:40:11,020
Kashmir.

600
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,350
Not this month,
I have a lot of bookings.

601
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:15,940
Next month.

602
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:22,560
"If you want,
I'll give you a million dreams."

603
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:29,980
"If you're happy then so am I."

604
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:34,310
"You're unique..."

605
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:37,980
"You're one of a kind."

606
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:44,520
"You don't feel different to me."

607
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:48,230
Mom.

608
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:52,230
Dev. Ayesha smokes cigarettes.

609
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:58,150
I know, mom.

610
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:03,310
- It's just sometimes...
- You know.

611
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:07,850
She keeps the doors
to your room closed.

612
00:41:09,270 --> 00:41:11,980
The doors of this house
never remained closed.

613
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:15,400
This won't do in this house.

614
00:41:16,270 --> 00:41:18,560
But mom, she writes in there.

615
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:21,650
Will she writes with the doors open?

616
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,440
This is her house as well.

617
00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:27,560
Fine, I'll do something.

618
00:41:27,650 --> 00:41:28,600
I will tell her.

619
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:32,900
"Moment..."

620
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:38,650
"Everything stopped in a moment."

621
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:44,980
"When you held my hand with yours."

622
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:48,520
"You go wherever I go."

623
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:52,230
"You're always by my side when I look.

624
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:56,060
"I am the season
and you're the breeze."

625
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:58,900
"Sweetheart."

626
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:03,020
"I laugh when you sing."

627
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:06,650
"I cry when you wither away."

628
00:42:06,730 --> 00:42:10,600
"I get drenched in
the shower of your love."

629
00:42:10,690 --> 00:42:13,440
"Sweetheart."

630
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:42,900
Dev.

631
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:47,350
Dev.

632
00:42:48,690 --> 00:42:49,810
Yeah...

633
00:42:53,940 --> 00:43:00,270
Do you think that every love story
has a 'happily ever after' ending?

634
00:44:55,850 --> 00:44:57,850
Aunty, how is it?

635
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:02,100
Is it your mom's birthday?

636
00:45:02,190 --> 00:45:02,810
Yes.

637
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:03,520
Tomorrow.

638
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:11,650
Yes, madam. Did you call?

639
00:45:13,190 --> 00:45:14,230
Yes, I did.

640
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:15,850
When will this fourth
passenger arrive?

641
00:45:16,150 --> 00:45:18,230
Do you know anything or not?

642
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:19,810
Who will open the door for him?

643
00:45:20,850 --> 00:45:23,440
Oh yes, the fourth passenger, madam.

644
00:45:23,770 --> 00:45:25,480
He will board at Bhusawal station.

645
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:28,770
You see, the train is running late.

646
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:31,060
It will reach at 11:30.

647
00:45:31,150 --> 00:45:32,560
11:30? So late.

648
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:38,350
It will ruin our sleep,
and what if it's some weird guy?

649
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:40,600
It will be a surprise.

650
00:45:40,690 --> 00:45:42,060
Surprise!

651
00:45:42,350 --> 00:45:43,730
Ta-dah!

652
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:44,560
What?

653
00:45:44,770 --> 00:45:48,400
Senior copy-writer and the youngest
partner in their company ever.

654
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:51,310
Wow...congrats my Jalebi.

655
00:45:52,060 --> 00:45:53,100
Even I have a good news.

656
00:45:53,190 --> 00:45:53,940
Hello.

657
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:57,310
- Lonely Planet just...
- All the perks, 25% salary raise.

658
00:45:57,400 --> 00:46:00,900
Plus just 5 days work week,
meaning Saturday-Sunday holiday.

659
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:03,060
They are even giving
me a car for pickup and drop.

660
00:46:03,270 --> 00:46:05,270
- But...
- I can finally get out.

661
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:07,900
- But...
- Maybe now I can write my book.

662
00:46:10,230 --> 00:46:13,850
But you were trying for freelance,
weren't you?

663
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:17,230
I am bored of running my
laptop in the corners of this relic.

664
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:20,350
And Samir said since it's
a startup and I get to freelance...

665
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:22,310
If Samir said it,
then there's no problem.

666
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:25,150
Meaning?

667
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:28,060
Why do you have a problem with Samir?

668
00:46:30,350 --> 00:46:30,940
It's nothing.

669
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:35,190
I am happy if you're happy.

670
00:46:37,690 --> 00:46:38,400
I can see that.

671
00:46:40,730 --> 00:46:41,850
Ayesh...

672
00:46:44,690 --> 00:46:49,940
Since the time we met, you kept
saying that you hate regular life.

673
00:46:50,190 --> 00:46:51,650
You don't like routine.

674
00:46:52,310 --> 00:46:54,980
And now suddenly you take up this
9-5 job and without any discussion.

675
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:58,900
I mean you'll work
from Monday to Friday.

676
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:00,730
I have a busy schedule
on the weekends.

677
00:47:01,150 --> 00:47:03,350
So I am sorry if I am not
jumping with joy about this.

678
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:12,020
But okay, I am happy that
you will get out of this old relic.

679
00:47:14,060 --> 00:47:15,900
- You know I didn't mean it that way.
- It's fine.

680
00:47:17,270 --> 00:47:20,150
But yes, someday we'll
live in our own house.

681
00:47:20,690 --> 00:47:23,980
In a normal house. With regular doors,
windows, and a shower.

682
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:33,350
Ayesh...this house, Old Delhi,
the tours, it's not just a job for me.

683
00:47:33,980 --> 00:47:35,810
This is who I am. This is my life.

684
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:38,690
My roots are connected
with this house.

685
00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:41,900
When we migrated from Lahore
with nothing in our hands...

686
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:43,770
...this old relic gave us refuge.

687
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:45,020
Grandpa's dreams were...

688
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:47,310
...that the doors of this manor
should never be closed for anyone.

689
00:47:49,690 --> 00:47:50,400
No...

690
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:52,310
You might feel its
melodrama or whatever...

691
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:55,060
...but, if I leave this house
and family, then I can never be yours.

692
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:58,100
Because I will no longer be me, Ayesh.

693
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:04,940
So as backward as this sounds,
that's my truth.

694
00:48:08,940 --> 00:48:09,900
And my truth?

695
00:48:11,690 --> 00:48:13,480
This is not my destination.

696
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:15,230
It can be yours.

697
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:19,900
And what did you say?

698
00:48:20,690 --> 00:48:22,230
Backward? Melodramatic?

699
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:25,350
- Is that what you think about me?
- What else should I think?

700
00:48:26,730 --> 00:48:29,440
You're the one who said that wow,
this manor is so cool, so charming,

701
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:30,400
I can spend my entire life here.

702
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:31,060
Yes, I did.

703
00:48:31,150 --> 00:48:32,560
But even you said
that sooner or later...

704
00:48:32,650 --> 00:48:34,060
...you want to do something
more with your life.

705
00:48:34,150 --> 00:48:35,650
Beyond Old Delhi.

706
00:48:36,850 --> 00:48:38,150
Like your travel company.

707
00:48:38,690 --> 00:48:39,980
Why don't you ever think about that?

708
00:48:40,060 --> 00:48:41,440
I will...

709
00:48:42,270 --> 00:48:44,900
But when the time's right,
and on my own terms.

710
00:48:45,850 --> 00:48:48,770
And whether its old or whatever,
I am going to keep them in my plans.

711
00:48:51,650 --> 00:48:54,600
If you can see this world,
and understand me...

712
00:48:54,690 --> 00:48:56,730
...only then can we
be happy together, Ayesh?

713
00:48:58,350 --> 00:48:58,940
Otherwise?

714
00:49:13,060 --> 00:49:15,310
"I miss you so much...

715
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:16,100
Excuse me.

716
00:49:16,270 --> 00:49:18,190
The train's been standing
here for so long.

717
00:49:18,270 --> 00:49:19,150
How long is the halt here?

718
00:49:19,350 --> 00:49:20,400
We're trying to find out, sir.

719
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:23,310
According to me, I think there's another
train crossing, so the line's busy.

720
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:24,190
Ohh...

721
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:25,400
It started.

722
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:26,650
It started.

723
00:49:28,850 --> 00:49:30,650
Madam, coffee? Sir, coffee.

724
00:49:30,730 --> 00:49:31,900
No, thank you.

725
00:49:32,850 --> 00:49:35,190
- So, what was I saying?
- Come on.

726
00:49:35,270 --> 00:49:36,440
- What?
- Come on, let's go.

727
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:37,400
There's no network.

728
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:40,690
Were you trying to find out the
delay or trying to start the engine?

729
00:49:42,270 --> 00:49:48,980
Dear, you know...I am always late.

730
00:49:49,270 --> 00:49:51,520
Allah, there he goes again.

731
00:49:52,310 --> 00:49:54,980
Fine, I won't say it.

732
00:49:57,100 --> 00:50:01,730
Then...it should be just like
the one you used to convince me.

733
00:50:07,810 --> 00:50:12,730
"If you want to say something
important, or to keep a promise."

734
00:50:14,020 --> 00:50:18,690
"If you want to call him back,
or just call out to him."

735
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:24,020
"I am always...late."

736
00:50:26,020 --> 00:50:31,100
"If I want to save
someone...from a sorrow."

737
00:50:32,190 --> 00:50:34,270
"The truth was something else..."

738
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:37,230
"...and I had to tell her that."

739
00:50:38,650 --> 00:50:40,100
"I am always..."

740
00:50:41,020 --> 00:50:41,730
Excuse me.

741
00:50:42,020 --> 00:50:42,650
Sorry.

742
00:50:44,770 --> 00:50:53,480
"We'll never...part ways..."

743
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:56,650
"Never."

744
00:50:58,310 --> 00:51:02,900
"What else can I say..."

745
00:51:03,150 --> 00:51:03,850
Ayesha.

746
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:06,690
"To you..."

747
00:51:07,350 --> 00:51:12,150
"To you..."

748
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:31,400
Why did you do it, Dev?

749
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:35,980
You were cheating
on me all this while.

750
00:51:38,270 --> 00:51:39,480
You have a wife.

751
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:41,310
And a child.

752
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:43,850
I was wrong.

753
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:50,060
My body kept lying to me,
my heart kept lying to me.

754
00:51:50,150 --> 00:51:52,310
You never loved me!

755
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:02,020
I destroyed myself because of you.

756
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:05,020
I destroyed myself because of you!

757
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:10,940
Go! Celebrate your birthday
party with your wife and your kid.

758
00:52:12,810 --> 00:52:14,190
I can't live anymore.

759
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:16,400
I can't live anymore.

760
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:20,400
No...

761
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:22,350
Ayesha.

762
00:52:23,230 --> 00:52:23,980
Ayesha.

763
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:26,400
Ayesha.

764
00:52:27,980 --> 00:52:29,850
Oh, God. Dev!

765
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:31,560
I knew it.

766
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:35,020
You can never forget to
wish me first on my birthday.

767
00:52:35,270 --> 00:52:36,350
Thank you so much.

768
00:52:37,060 --> 00:52:38,810
Pulti, look who's here.

769
00:52:38,980 --> 00:52:40,150
Look, papa.

770
00:52:41,190 --> 00:52:45,810
Papa! How did you
get on a moving train?

771
00:52:46,310 --> 00:52:47,690
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

772
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:51,940
Papa got on the train
in Bhusawal station.

773
00:52:52,690 --> 00:52:54,560
But he was waiting
for the date to change.

774
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:58,310
To see this smile.

775
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:05,440
Papa, you brought a cake for mom,
but what did you get for me?

776
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:06,440
For you?

777
00:53:06,690 --> 00:53:07,900
Jalebi.

778
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:18,350
Happy Birthday to you.

779
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:20,650
My grump.

780
00:53:22,310 --> 00:53:24,810
It's a Mathur family tradition.
Come on.

781
00:53:25,350 --> 00:53:25,900
Really?

782
00:53:27,310 --> 00:53:28,650
I stay cooped up in my room all day.

783
00:53:28,730 --> 00:53:31,270
And now you've brought
me here on my birthday...

784
00:53:31,350 --> 00:53:32,310
...to treat me to some Jalebi.

785
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:36,850
But there's no better Jalebi than the
ones that you get in Parathe Wali Lane.

786
00:53:38,310 --> 00:53:39,100
I am pregnant.

787
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:41,310
What?

788
00:53:43,310 --> 00:53:44,020
Yeah.

789
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:52,440
- Boss...
- Yeah...

790
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:58,600
Pack twenty more boxes.
I am going to be a father.

791
00:54:02,730 --> 00:54:06,350
Ayesh, you have no
clue what this means to me.

792
00:54:08,060 --> 00:54:09,100
And mom...

793
00:54:09,730 --> 00:54:12,900
She's going to be a grandmother.

794
00:54:18,270 --> 00:54:20,350
- Don't look at me like this.
- Like what.

795
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:21,900
I don't want any child right now.

796
00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:23,730
We just got married, Dev.

797
00:54:23,810 --> 00:54:25,940
And there's much I
want to do with my life.

798
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:28,020
I am just 21.

799
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:31,310
I want to write.
I want to travel. See the world.

800
00:54:31,690 --> 00:54:32,810
I just started writing.

801
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:34,230
And this pregnancy
will ruin everything.

802
00:54:34,310 --> 00:54:36,400
It's too early for me,
Dev, I can't do it.

803
00:54:36,810 --> 00:54:38,100
How is it early?

804
00:54:39,270 --> 00:54:41,600
And who says you can't
do these things afterward?

805
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:45,440
And anyway, we can't take a life...

806
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:49,520
I can't do that, Ayesh.

807
00:54:51,770 --> 00:54:52,810
Sweety...

808
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:58,150
We'll have a daughter.

809
00:55:07,350 --> 00:55:08,690
What are you doing here?

810
00:55:08,770 --> 00:55:10,100
Come in and meet my husband.

811
00:55:10,190 --> 00:55:11,230
- No, it's okay.
- Why no?

812
00:55:11,310 --> 00:55:11,900
Come on.

813
00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:12,810
Come inside.

814
00:55:14,980 --> 00:55:16,060
This is Ayesha.

815
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:18,810
She is a writer,
of a best-seller novel.

816
00:55:21,100 --> 00:55:23,100
You know,
she's basically based in Mumbai...

817
00:55:23,230 --> 00:55:25,440
...but, she's going to Delhi
for a book reading session.

818
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:26,150
Okay.

819
00:55:26,730 --> 00:55:28,980
Ayesha, this is Dev.

820
00:55:29,230 --> 00:55:30,060
Your husband.

821
00:55:31,730 --> 00:55:32,980
Yes, my husband.

822
00:55:33,940 --> 00:55:34,520
Hi, Dev.

823
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:36,060
Hi.

824
00:55:36,270 --> 00:55:37,810
He owns a big travel company.

825
00:55:38,060 --> 00:55:40,230
Most of our work is
handled through the website.

826
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:41,690
But I handle the accounts.

827
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:44,900
I am an MBA after all,
and it should come to some use.

828
00:55:46,310 --> 00:55:48,730
You know, we built our
office right behind the manor.

829
00:55:48,810 --> 00:55:49,810
By renovating the place.

830
00:55:50,230 --> 00:55:53,190
- But I said...
- Mom, cut the cake.

831
00:55:53,270 --> 00:55:54,350
Just two minutes, dear.

832
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:56,440
Let us finish talking,
then we'll cut the cake. Okay.

833
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:57,650
But I made it clear.

834
00:55:57,730 --> 00:56:00,650
You can expand the business
as much as you want.

835
00:56:00,770 --> 00:56:02,350
But one day a week is reserved for us.

836
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:04,150
For me and Pulti.

837
00:56:04,730 --> 00:56:06,060
And we get that.

838
00:56:08,650 --> 00:56:11,730
Business has grown twin
folds for Disha Travel Company.

839
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:12,600
What?

840
00:56:14,650 --> 00:56:17,690
Actually, our daughter
Pulti's real name is Disha.

841
00:56:17,810 --> 00:56:20,650
So we named our company
Disha Travel Company after her.

842
00:56:20,770 --> 00:56:21,770
Isn't that nice?

843
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:28,810
- Diya.
- Nah...

844
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:31,150
Kaya.

845
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:32,100
Kaya?

846
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:34,400
She's our daughter and
not some skin care product.

847
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:39,690
Tara.

848
00:56:44,850 --> 00:56:46,020
How is Devika?

849
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:50,310
Tell mom, nice try.

850
00:56:51,230 --> 00:56:52,900
And what did your dad suggest?

851
00:56:53,980 --> 00:56:55,230
Devisha.

852
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:56,400
Excuse me.

853
00:56:57,770 --> 00:57:00,730
He was just trying to come up with
something nice but adding up our names.

854
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:02,730
Don't say anything about my dad.

855
00:57:03,770 --> 00:57:04,560
Fine.

856
00:57:10,150 --> 00:57:11,350
Actually...

857
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:17,480
That's not a bad idea.

858
00:57:20,060 --> 00:57:21,060
Dev.

859
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:22,980
Ayesha.

860
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:26,560
Disha!

861
00:57:30,770 --> 00:57:31,350
Dev.

862
00:57:32,190 --> 00:57:35,560
Ladies and Gentlemen.

863
00:57:35,770 --> 00:57:38,230
This announcement is
being made in public interest...

864
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:45,810
...that Dev's Ayesha and Ayesha's Dev
have found their 'Disha' (Direction)

865
00:57:55,350 --> 00:58:04,520
"The more I look at you...
I can't get enough of you."

866
00:58:05,020 --> 00:58:13,940
"The more I think about
you... I can't get enough of you."

867
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:24,190
"Our love clearly reflects
in your eyes and in mine."

868
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:33,690
"It beats in mine
your love and my love."

869
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:38,440
"My love and your love."

870
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:47,980
"The more I look at you...
I can't get enough of you."

871
00:58:48,690 --> 00:58:58,060
"The more I think about
you... I can't get enough of you."

872
00:59:08,690 --> 00:59:13,150
"It's little yours,
and a little mine."

873
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:17,980
"In fact, it's our dream together."

874
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:27,560
"A sweet tune that
I can hear these days."

875
00:59:28,060 --> 00:59:36,690
"All our sorrows will be
alleviated with just a smile."

876
00:59:36,850 --> 00:59:41,440
"My love and your love."

877
00:59:41,650 --> 00:59:46,600
"My love and your love."

878
00:59:54,310 --> 00:59:55,020
What happened?

879
01:00:01,100 --> 01:00:02,230
Shall we go out?

880
01:00:03,020 --> 01:00:03,650
No.

881
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:04,900
Please.

882
01:00:05,650 --> 01:00:06,270
No.

883
01:00:06,810 --> 01:00:11,350
"No lives forever..."

884
01:00:11,690 --> 01:00:16,150
"...but love stays forever and ever."

885
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:21,270
"The sun, the moon, and the breeze..."

886
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:25,440
"...will keep it alive."

887
01:00:26,310 --> 01:00:31,060
"Even after we're no more..."

888
01:00:31,190 --> 01:00:34,940
"...love will still
prevail in this world."

889
01:00:35,020 --> 01:00:39,520
"My love and your love."

890
01:00:39,850 --> 01:00:44,440
"My love and your love."

891
01:00:45,020 --> 01:00:53,850
"The more I look at you...
I can't get enough of you."

892
01:00:54,730 --> 01:01:04,190
"The more I think about
you... I can't get enough of you."

893
01:01:20,980 --> 01:01:22,020
Isn't the cake nice, dear?

894
01:01:23,770 --> 01:01:24,600
One photo, please.

895
01:01:27,190 --> 01:01:27,690
Smile.

896
01:01:27,980 --> 01:01:29,150
Dev, smile.

897
01:02:10,060 --> 01:02:11,730
- What a happy family.
- Ayesha, I...

898
01:02:11,810 --> 01:02:12,310
See.

899
01:02:13,310 --> 01:02:13,850
See.

900
01:02:15,060 --> 01:02:18,270
Dev, plus Ayesha...Disha.

901
01:02:20,060 --> 01:02:20,770
Disha.

902
01:02:22,060 --> 01:02:24,100
But my daughter could only be Disha.

903
01:02:24,190 --> 01:02:25,980
Couldn't you think
of a different name?

904
01:02:28,350 --> 01:02:28,980
Disha.

905
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:44,020
I am sorry that her
non-existence changed everything.

906
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:47,980
Everything.

907
01:03:07,980 --> 01:03:09,400
Why are you crying?

908
01:03:11,940 --> 01:03:14,440
I wasn't crying, I was sleeping.

909
01:03:16,020 --> 01:03:17,100
And you woke me up.

910
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:19,600
I must go to the toilet.

911
01:03:21,270 --> 01:03:22,600
Where are your parents?

912
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:29,940
Mom. Toilet.

913
01:03:30,020 --> 01:03:31,020
When did you get up, dear?

914
01:03:31,100 --> 01:03:31,980
Come, let's go.

915
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:11,730
You didn't get married.

916
01:04:15,270 --> 01:04:16,400
What does it look like?

917
01:04:18,770 --> 01:04:20,560
Would it have made
things easier for you?

918
01:04:36,650 --> 01:04:38,190
I am done.

919
01:04:38,270 --> 01:04:40,150
Done. So fast.

920
01:04:52,850 --> 01:04:57,190
There's one more thing that
irritates me more than your anger.

921
01:04:57,850 --> 01:04:58,650
What?

922
01:04:58,940 --> 01:05:01,020
Your silence, what else.

923
01:05:07,940 --> 01:05:09,810
Well, so things look serious.

924
01:05:11,650 --> 01:05:15,350
Fine. I'll have to do something,
like always.

925
01:05:23,060 --> 01:05:25,310
Greetings, dear. Bless you.

926
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:27,730
No, everything is all right.

927
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:32,940
I was saying that your
mother wants to talk to Faizal.

928
01:05:35,900 --> 01:05:37,980
Oh my, God. I completely forgot.

929
01:05:38,060 --> 01:05:39,230
It's nighttime out there.

930
01:05:39,900 --> 01:05:41,270
No, I am sorry.

931
01:05:41,560 --> 01:05:44,350
No, the train's running a little late.

932
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:45,730
We'll reach Gwalior in some time.

933
01:05:46,230 --> 01:05:47,650
No, dear. It's all right.

934
01:05:47,770 --> 01:05:49,190
Goodbye.

935
01:05:51,350 --> 01:05:52,940
Both, Father and son are sound asleep.

936
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:55,980
Why did you have to disturb
the children at this hour?

937
01:05:56,230 --> 01:05:59,270
I wasn't disturbing them.

938
01:05:59,850 --> 01:06:00,650
He's our son.

939
01:06:00,730 --> 01:06:02,850
I wanted to talk
to him and called him.

940
01:06:03,100 --> 01:06:05,600
Wishes don't keep track of time.

941
01:06:25,770 --> 01:06:26,560
Faizu.

942
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:30,690
My son.

943
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:49,270
Mom, hiccups again.

944
01:06:58,900 --> 01:07:00,520
Hiccups gone.

945
01:07:02,310 --> 01:07:05,350
Even my mother-in-law does
the same thing to cure hiccups.

946
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:07,400
One of her relatives
taught her this trick.

947
01:07:09,690 --> 01:07:10,600
Brother, some water.

948
01:07:14,770 --> 01:07:16,310
Careful Deva.

949
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:20,270
You two just got married, and
she already caught you by the nose.

950
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:28,690
You know mom,
there's no cure for hiccups.

951
01:07:28,940 --> 01:07:33,480
The least we can do is
try to divert their attention...

952
01:07:33,690 --> 01:07:34,980
...and hope the hiccups disappear.

953
01:07:44,500 --> 01:07:45,910
- I want Agra's sweet.
- Where?

954
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,120
I want Agra's sweet.

955
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:48,540
First, comb your hair.

956
01:07:48,620 --> 01:07:49,040
No.

957
01:07:49,080 --> 01:07:49,540
Wait.

958
01:07:49,620 --> 01:07:50,250
Papa, I am going.

959
01:07:50,330 --> 01:07:51,250
Please look after her.

960
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:52,620
- Pulti.
- Disha.

961
01:07:53,410 --> 01:07:54,080
Statue.

962
01:07:57,450 --> 01:07:59,200
I am your father, my child.

963
01:08:00,500 --> 01:08:03,700
So Disha wants to
taste Agra's sweets, huh.

964
01:08:04,500 --> 01:08:05,200
Release.

965
01:08:07,700 --> 01:08:08,750
Let's go.

966
01:08:12,330 --> 01:08:14,330
Where is he? Where is he?

967
01:08:14,750 --> 01:08:15,830
There he is.

968
01:08:16,330 --> 01:08:18,830
Arjun, I am Sunny Singh.

969
01:08:19,410 --> 01:08:22,790
You know my wife, Simar. She...

970
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:24,500
Actually,
we just got married yesterday.

971
01:08:24,580 --> 01:08:26,200
But she's a big fan of yours.

972
01:08:26,290 --> 01:08:26,830
She...

973
01:08:26,910 --> 01:08:28,370
You know your song "Tum Se".

974
01:08:28,660 --> 01:08:31,370
If you can sing that once for Simar,
then it will make her really happy.

975
01:08:31,790 --> 01:08:33,790
And the train's delayed by two hours.

976
01:08:34,120 --> 01:08:35,580
This will help you pass your time too.

977
01:08:35,790 --> 01:08:37,080
And my Simar will be happy as well.

978
01:08:37,290 --> 01:08:38,040
Right?

979
01:08:38,910 --> 01:08:39,790
I am sorry.

980
01:08:40,540 --> 01:08:41,160
What?

981
01:08:42,250 --> 01:08:43,870
I have a sore throat. I am sorry.

982
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:46,660
- That's okay, we'll get some medicines for...
- I said I am sorry.

983
01:08:49,330 --> 01:08:51,040
We artists are not
some public property.

984
01:08:52,660 --> 01:08:54,080
Now please,
and I am saying this politely.

985
01:08:57,080 --> 01:08:58,080
I am sorry.

986
01:08:58,700 --> 01:09:01,750
You know, just to make Simar happy...

987
01:09:02,370 --> 01:09:03,160
Anyway...

988
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:07,160
Sorry to disturb you.

989
01:09:25,660 --> 01:09:29,870
You know, I had a boyfriend
before I got married.

990
01:09:34,870 --> 01:09:36,410
I really loved him.

991
01:09:39,580 --> 01:09:41,000
More than you can imagine.

992
01:09:45,080 --> 01:09:48,040
- Everyone has a past.
- Correct.

993
01:09:54,500 --> 01:09:57,660
But Dev never asked
me anything about my past.

994
01:10:01,790 --> 01:10:02,830
Who? When?

995
01:10:04,540 --> 01:10:05,830
Where? How?

996
01:10:07,290 --> 01:10:07,910
Nothing.

997
01:10:11,540 --> 01:10:16,200
When I met him in his house,
I was assured about everything...

998
01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:19,250
...that I had heard about the Manor.

999
01:10:20,870 --> 01:10:25,370
You know, he took one look
at Pulti and took her in his arms.

1000
01:10:26,790 --> 01:10:28,910
He never asked me
for her father's name.

1001
01:10:30,160 --> 01:10:32,580
He just had one request
before the wedding.

1002
01:10:35,330 --> 01:10:37,200
That we'll call her Disha.

1003
01:10:39,910 --> 01:10:40,620
That's it.

1004
01:10:43,950 --> 01:10:45,000
You're right.

1005
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:49,410
Everyone has a past.

1006
01:10:51,540 --> 01:10:55,950
But only a few can see beyond it.

1007
01:11:14,700 --> 01:11:15,290
Dev.

1008
01:11:26,120 --> 01:11:27,080
I told you.

1009
01:11:27,370 --> 01:11:29,330
I told you.

1010
01:11:29,910 --> 01:11:31,580
Not to roam around on the bike.

1011
01:11:32,410 --> 01:11:36,000
But you two are over smart.
You think you know everything.

1012
01:11:36,450 --> 01:11:38,830
But you never listen to that
one person who bore two children.

1013
01:11:38,910 --> 01:11:41,120
Please, mom.
This is not the time for all this.

1014
01:11:42,040 --> 01:11:42,790
I see...

1015
01:11:43,790 --> 01:11:45,410
- So now you don't have time for me.
- Mom.

1016
01:11:45,580 --> 01:11:46,700
- Let's go inside.
- You don't have time for me.

1017
01:11:46,790 --> 01:11:47,410
Mom...

1018
01:11:47,790 --> 01:11:50,620
God knows whom they think they are.

1019
01:11:50,950 --> 01:11:52,580
We are not their enemys.

1020
01:11:52,910 --> 01:11:56,000
I wish they had listened to me.

1021
01:11:56,870 --> 01:11:58,790
- She thinks it's my fault.
- No.

1022
01:11:59,620 --> 01:12:01,160
She thinks it's my fault, Dev.

1023
01:12:01,410 --> 01:12:02,040
No.

1024
01:12:02,870 --> 01:12:06,330
And what about all the dinners,
functions, venerations and prayers.

1025
01:12:07,700 --> 01:12:09,580
Everyone knew it was
a difficult pregnancy.

1026
01:12:10,540 --> 01:12:12,410
You knew that I didn't
even want the baby.

1027
01:12:12,500 --> 01:12:13,290
I know.

1028
01:12:13,370 --> 01:12:15,000
- I know.
- But no.

1029
01:12:15,500 --> 01:12:17,660
You and your mother cornered me.

1030
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:22,000
I told you it was too soon.
I wasn't ready.

1031
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:24,700
I wasn't ready.

1032
01:12:25,330 --> 01:12:27,660
I wasn't ready. My baby wasn't ready.

1033
01:12:27,750 --> 01:12:28,370
I know.

1034
01:12:28,450 --> 01:12:30,250
My baby wasn't ready.

1035
01:12:31,330 --> 01:12:34,000
I lost the child. I am sorry.

1036
01:12:35,580 --> 01:12:37,160
It's not your fault, Ayesh.

1037
01:12:38,790 --> 01:12:40,160
It's no one's fault.

1038
01:12:42,290 --> 01:12:43,830
These things happen.

1039
01:12:47,830 --> 01:12:49,080
These things happen?

1040
01:12:52,370 --> 01:12:53,580
These things happen!

1041
01:12:54,950 --> 01:12:59,660
We lost our child, Dev.
Not missed some insurance policy.

1042
01:13:00,410 --> 01:13:01,580
These things happen!

1043
01:13:02,450 --> 01:13:04,580
Do you have any idea
what happened to me?

1044
01:13:05,500 --> 01:13:07,700
Does your mother know what I lost?

1045
01:13:08,330 --> 01:13:10,250
And she keeps telling
absurd things to me.

1046
01:13:10,410 --> 01:13:12,750
You think it doesn't
make a difference to mom?

1047
01:13:15,790 --> 01:13:17,620
That woman did every
possible thing for us.

1048
01:13:20,250 --> 01:13:23,000
And it wasn't just you and mom,
even I lost that child.

1049
01:13:23,200 --> 01:13:27,000
So why tell everyone
in the neighborhood?

1050
01:13:29,540 --> 01:13:31,330
Can't she keep it to herself?

1051
01:13:31,910 --> 01:13:34,750
Everyone's gathered downstairs
to watch this charade.

1052
01:13:34,830 --> 01:13:38,200
Ayesha, stop dragging
my mother into everything.

1053
01:13:41,620 --> 01:13:45,660
Don't put me in a position where I'll have
to choose between my mother and you.

1054
01:13:48,870 --> 01:13:49,910
And as for me...

1055
01:13:54,410 --> 01:13:57,000
Just because I wasn't carrying
the child, wasn't she a part of me?

1056
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:00,250
She wasn't a part of me?

1057
01:14:03,410 --> 01:14:04,830
I am not heart-broken?

1058
01:14:07,160 --> 01:14:08,160
I am not in pain?

1059
01:14:30,250 --> 01:14:30,870
Dev.

1060
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:33,580
Dev.

1061
01:14:36,160 --> 01:14:39,450
"Nothing is like...it used to be."

1062
01:14:39,910 --> 01:14:40,620
Dev.

1063
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:41,700
Dev.

1064
01:14:43,160 --> 01:14:43,910
Dev.

1065
01:14:44,160 --> 01:14:52,160
"Tears keep tricking...down my face."

1066
01:14:56,950 --> 01:14:58,540
Hey, are you blind?

1067
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:00,370
I am talking to you.

1068
01:15:00,450 --> 01:15:01,290
Look at me.

1069
01:15:02,370 --> 01:15:03,160
Why you...

1070
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:05,870
Beat him.

1071
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:08,120
Hit him.

1072
01:15:17,160 --> 01:15:22,790
"Nothing is like...
it used to be."

1073
01:15:23,250 --> 01:15:29,080
"Tears keep tricking...
down my face."

1074
01:15:29,410 --> 01:15:35,290
"The weather is no
longer it used to be."

1075
01:15:35,580 --> 01:15:41,330
"The clouds are here...but
there's no rain."

1076
01:15:41,700 --> 01:15:47,620
"What are this crossroads
we've come to?"

1077
01:15:47,910 --> 01:15:53,660
"The roads are still here...
but not the companion."

1078
01:16:10,750 --> 01:16:13,660
Have a sweet, brother Dev?
Its a daughter.

1079
01:16:18,750 --> 01:16:24,290
"Come let's walk down...
the same lane..."

1080
01:16:24,500 --> 01:16:30,620
"...where we experienced
those sweet fragrances."

1081
01:16:30,830 --> 01:16:36,660
"Maybe there's something left"

1082
01:16:36,830 --> 01:16:43,000
"Where we started this journey together"

1083
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:49,120
"The one that we've lost,
and is over."

1084
01:16:49,450 --> 01:16:55,500
"Maybe we can rekindle
that love again."

1085
01:17:20,200 --> 01:17:25,950
"What is this place
fate has brought us to."

1086
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:32,000
"Time's running its pace
but we're standing still."

1087
01:17:32,290 --> 01:17:38,450
"My dreams have breathed their last..."

1088
01:17:38,660 --> 01:17:44,500
"...and are lost
in the endless depths."

1089
01:17:44,580 --> 01:17:50,660
"Not a single sound that gets to us."

1090
01:17:50,830 --> 01:17:57,040
"We've alleviated from ourselves."

1091
01:17:57,080 --> 01:18:02,910
"Silence has cropped
up in our relationships."

1092
01:18:03,160 --> 01:18:09,080
"And the heartbeats are missing."

1093
01:18:09,410 --> 01:18:15,000
"Come back to me like before..."

1094
01:18:15,200 --> 01:18:21,120
"I need you to hold
me tight in your arms."

1095
01:18:21,410 --> 01:18:27,540
"I can't live in this darkness..."

1096
01:18:27,620 --> 01:18:33,540
"...let's bring back those dawns again."

1097
01:18:33,790 --> 01:18:40,910
"...let's bring back those dawns again."

1098
01:18:56,500 --> 01:18:57,080
Dev.

1099
01:18:57,950 --> 01:18:58,500
Dev.

1100
01:18:59,200 --> 01:19:00,700
Get up Dev, and come down.

1101
01:19:00,790 --> 01:19:01,500
What happened, mom?

1102
01:19:01,580 --> 01:19:03,120
Come down. Come on.

1103
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:04,040
What happened?

1104
01:19:04,700 --> 01:19:05,250
Come on.

1105
01:19:05,450 --> 01:19:06,160
What happened?

1106
01:19:06,580 --> 01:19:08,120
I don't know what's wrong with her.

1107
01:19:24,370 --> 01:19:25,410
What is this, Ayesh?

1108
01:19:28,160 --> 01:19:28,700
What is it?

1109
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:44,870
Maybe not every love-story
has a happily-ever-after ending.

1110
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:58,040
I am sorry, Dev.

1111
01:20:04,950 --> 01:20:06,000
I couldn't do it.

1112
01:20:21,410 --> 01:20:22,500
This marriage...

1113
01:20:23,660 --> 01:20:25,200
This marriage was a mistake.

1114
01:20:36,950 --> 01:20:38,910
I lost everything here.

1115
01:20:42,410 --> 01:20:43,660
My self-respect.

1116
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:47,290
My child.

1117
01:20:57,040 --> 01:20:58,500
I don't love you anymore.

1118
01:21:07,580 --> 01:21:11,160
I am leaving your home,
but not your life.

1119
01:21:14,580 --> 01:21:16,620
I wish I knew how to live without you.

1120
01:21:21,330 --> 01:21:22,830
But, I will try.

1121
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:31,910
No, mom.

1122
01:21:32,120 --> 01:21:32,830
Deva.

1123
01:21:33,950 --> 01:21:35,450
- Ayesha.
- Let her go.

1124
01:21:38,120 --> 01:21:39,160
Sister-in-law!

1125
01:22:33,040 --> 01:22:35,450
You know I wrote that song for her.

1126
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,040
But I vented my frustration
on that Sardar instead.

1127
01:22:39,660 --> 01:22:40,540
Sorry.

1128
01:22:41,700 --> 01:22:43,160
Why are you apologizing to me?

1129
01:22:43,700 --> 01:22:46,000
Look, Arjun. You were in love.

1130
01:22:46,120 --> 01:22:47,330
And you were completely
devoted to her.

1131
01:22:47,870 --> 01:22:50,120
I am not telling you to stop loving.

1132
01:22:50,660 --> 01:22:52,160
But you must change its course.

1133
01:22:53,200 --> 01:22:55,830
When it's not possible
to reach your destination...

1134
01:22:56,160 --> 01:22:58,790
...it's better to let
go at a beautiful turn.

1135
01:23:05,950 --> 01:23:06,530
Hi.

1136
01:23:08,900 --> 01:23:10,240
It's not right for me to stay here.

1137
01:23:10,280 --> 01:23:11,950
If I stay, then I'll take your side...

1138
01:23:12,030 --> 01:23:12,990
...and that's not right.

1139
01:23:13,490 --> 01:23:14,530
This is your family matter.

1140
01:23:14,650 --> 01:23:17,200
You guys decide what to do.
No problem.

1141
01:23:17,530 --> 01:23:18,240
Just solve it here.

1142
01:23:18,740 --> 01:23:19,450
It's all right.

1143
01:23:26,150 --> 01:23:27,030
Look, dear.

1144
01:23:32,820 --> 01:23:34,450
It takes only a moment to break ties...

1145
01:23:35,490 --> 01:23:38,030
...but takes an entire
lifetime to build one.

1146
01:23:40,150 --> 01:23:43,400
It's every woman's responsibility
to save her marriage.

1147
01:23:47,070 --> 01:23:48,650
That's not the point, mom.

1148
01:23:49,240 --> 01:23:51,530
The point is that
you guys love each other.

1149
01:23:52,200 --> 01:23:54,360
Stop acting like you guys don't.

1150
01:23:54,990 --> 01:23:57,450
Look, I know things
are not going right.

1151
01:23:57,820 --> 01:23:59,900
- But if...
- Why don't you two go somewhere?

1152
01:24:01,570 --> 01:24:04,950
Shimla. Manali, or maybe...

1153
01:24:05,030 --> 01:24:05,780
Kashmir.

1154
01:24:12,780 --> 01:24:13,900
Will you come?

1155
01:24:18,570 --> 01:24:31,400
"You're the one that
lights up my world."

1156
01:24:33,150 --> 01:24:46,860
- "You make my nights and dawn."
- Arjun! Yes!

1157
01:25:10,700 --> 01:25:13,780
"We'll never part ways..."

1158
01:25:14,200 --> 01:25:18,030
"Never... Never..."

1159
01:25:19,240 --> 01:25:22,450
"What else can I say..."

1160
01:25:22,610 --> 01:25:25,820
"To you..."

1161
01:25:26,200 --> 01:25:33,950
"You're the one that
lights up my world."

1162
01:25:34,200 --> 01:25:42,360
"You make my nights and dawn."

1163
01:25:42,900 --> 01:25:45,610
"We'll never part ways..."

1164
01:25:45,990 --> 01:25:50,360
"Never... Never..."

1165
01:25:51,200 --> 01:25:53,650
"What else can I say..."

1166
01:25:59,240 --> 01:26:02,070
"You're like a tale..."

1167
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:06,450
"You're like a sonnet."

1168
01:26:07,110 --> 01:26:14,240
"I want to keep hearing
you night and day."

1169
01:26:15,200 --> 01:26:17,900
"You're my peace of mind..."

1170
01:26:18,110 --> 01:26:22,900
"...the cure to every pain."

1171
01:26:23,200 --> 01:26:30,200
"I can't live a moment without you."

1172
01:26:30,240 --> 01:26:37,360
"You're the one that
lights up my world."

1173
01:26:38,200 --> 01:26:45,820
"You make my nights and dawn."

1174
01:26:46,900 --> 01:26:49,610
"We'll never part ways..."

1175
01:26:50,150 --> 01:26:54,320
"Never... Never..."

1176
01:26:55,200 --> 01:26:57,490
"What else can I say..."

1177
01:26:58,030 --> 01:27:02,530
"To you..."

1178
01:27:19,110 --> 01:27:26,490
"You're my journey and my caravan."

1179
01:27:27,240 --> 01:27:34,360
"You're my destination and my path."

1180
01:27:35,200 --> 01:27:42,110
"Your love's had this effect on me."

1181
01:27:43,200 --> 01:27:49,950
"Your footsteps makes my heart beat."

1182
01:27:50,200 --> 01:27:56,280
"You're the one that
lights up my world."

1183
01:27:58,240 --> 01:28:05,360
"You make my nights and dawn."

1184
01:28:06,990 --> 01:28:09,610
"We'll never part ways..."

1185
01:28:10,200 --> 01:28:13,400
"Never... Never..."

1186
01:28:15,200 --> 01:28:17,450
"What else can I say..."

1187
01:28:18,200 --> 01:28:21,700
"To you..."

1188
01:28:22,990 --> 01:28:25,950
"We'll never part ways..."

1189
01:28:26,200 --> 01:28:30,320
"Never... Never..."

1190
01:28:31,200 --> 01:28:33,610
"What else can I say..."

1191
01:28:34,070 --> 01:28:40,610
"To you..."

1192
01:28:46,200 --> 01:28:48,150
You were amazing, Arjun.

1193
01:28:48,320 --> 01:28:49,320
Thank you so much.

1194
01:28:49,490 --> 01:28:50,320
Let's go, dear.

1195
01:28:52,610 --> 01:28:53,400
Come on.

1196
01:28:54,740 --> 01:28:55,400
Yeah.

1197
01:28:58,610 --> 01:29:00,820
- Very nice, young man.
- Thank you, sir.

1198
01:29:01,030 --> 01:29:03,610
You sing from your heart.

1199
01:29:04,650 --> 01:29:07,030
Can I say something young man,
if you don't mind?

1200
01:29:07,110 --> 01:29:07,860
Of course.

1201
01:29:08,820 --> 01:29:11,030
Their love is out of the world.

1202
01:29:13,070 --> 01:29:15,490
Those who are not destined to meet.

1203
01:29:30,200 --> 01:29:32,530
Will you love me just like that?

1204
01:29:36,990 --> 01:29:37,740
What the...

1205
01:29:39,280 --> 01:29:40,860
- Music heals, bro.
- Correct.

1206
01:29:42,280 --> 01:29:43,530
That's a huge burden off my heart.

1207
01:29:44,570 --> 01:29:46,280
- Thanks, guys.
- Oh, come on.

1208
01:29:47,700 --> 01:29:52,240
The journey comes to an end,
but life goes on.

1209
01:30:03,070 --> 01:30:08,280
...Nizamuddin Express is
arriving on Platform no. 17.

1210
01:30:08,700 --> 01:30:11,070
Come on, papa. Let's go.

1211
01:30:13,820 --> 01:30:16,200
Why are you walking so slow? Let's go.

1212
01:30:19,650 --> 01:30:20,200
Sorry.

1213
01:30:22,280 --> 01:30:23,150
Thank you.

1214
01:30:25,990 --> 01:30:27,740
I should be saying thank you.

1215
01:30:29,030 --> 01:30:30,400
I ate all your food.

1216
01:30:31,700 --> 01:30:33,530
You were such a good company.

1217
01:30:36,200 --> 01:30:40,150
You don't know what you gave me.

1218
01:30:46,280 --> 01:30:47,240
My home.

1219
01:30:50,240 --> 01:30:51,280
My family.

1220
01:30:54,200 --> 01:30:54,860
Dev.

1221
01:31:00,650 --> 01:31:03,110
Actually,
I had a hunch when I saw you.

1222
01:31:06,110 --> 01:31:08,280
But, when you caught Dev's nose, I...

1223
01:31:11,650 --> 01:31:12,780
Anyway...

1224
01:31:15,610 --> 01:31:17,650
Maybe you won't want to meet me again.

1225
01:31:19,400 --> 01:31:21,360
But, I'll be happy to meet you.

1226
01:31:26,320 --> 01:31:28,110
You do have our address.

1227
01:31:31,200 --> 01:31:32,200
Do come over some day.

1228
01:31:33,240 --> 01:31:34,240
I'll really like that.

1229
01:31:39,740 --> 01:31:40,780
Thank you.

1230
01:32:30,360 --> 01:32:33,990
Papa. Statue over.

1231
01:32:34,240 --> 01:32:36,820
Mom, see what's wrong with papa.

1232
01:32:38,700 --> 01:32:40,610
Papa, what happened?

1233
01:32:41,900 --> 01:32:43,070
Papa.

1234
01:33:37,360 --> 01:33:38,360
I did come.

1235
01:33:41,360 --> 01:33:42,240
Kashmir.

1236
01:33:45,360 --> 01:33:46,570
I was there, Ayesh.

1237
01:33:49,950 --> 01:33:51,700
You were standing
in front of the stream,

1238
01:33:53,610 --> 01:33:55,700
Wearing a black color jacket.

1239
01:33:57,240 --> 01:33:58,780
You were looking at the water.

1240
01:34:00,360 --> 01:34:01,990
I can never forget that face.

1241
01:34:02,780 --> 01:34:05,530
Made me feel like I have
distanced you from yourself.

1242
01:34:06,450 --> 01:34:09,320
I don't think I ever loved
you more than at that moment.

1243
01:34:11,950 --> 01:34:13,860
Because everything
changed that moment.

1244
01:34:28,820 --> 01:34:31,700
It seemed like the entire universe
was trying to tell me something.

1245
01:34:31,780 --> 01:34:33,780
And I am so stupid
that I can't understand.

1246
01:34:37,990 --> 01:34:39,200
Then I saw you.

1247
01:34:41,200 --> 01:34:43,400
For the first time,
I thought about you.

1248
01:34:45,110 --> 01:34:51,780
Why should you make all
the sacrifice in your life?

1249
01:34:54,200 --> 01:34:56,030
Why can't I do something?

1250
01:35:21,070 --> 01:35:22,150
Did you ever think...

1251
01:35:25,860 --> 01:35:27,950
Why I started the divorce proceedings?

1252
01:35:29,780 --> 01:35:32,030
Why did I become the
bad guy in your view?

1253
01:35:38,240 --> 01:35:40,450
Because you were
complete even without me.

1254
01:35:43,200 --> 01:35:46,740
My Ayesha's world was much
bigger than Netaji's manor.

1255
01:35:48,650 --> 01:35:52,070
It was longer and broader.

1256
01:35:55,700 --> 01:35:58,070
I wonder what I was trying to do?

1257
01:36:01,650 --> 01:36:04,530
How can anyone contain
the sea in a well?

1258
01:36:11,150 --> 01:36:13,030
And as for your novel.

1259
01:36:15,400 --> 01:36:16,320
I read it.

1260
01:36:19,360 --> 01:36:20,610
Over and over again.

1261
01:36:24,900 --> 01:36:31,530
And after reading it,
I knew...that I am not your destination.

1262
01:36:35,780 --> 01:36:40,610
I was just happy that I could
give you a small push in your flight.

1263
01:36:43,820 --> 01:36:45,950
Don't let it go waste, Ayesha.

1264
01:36:47,950 --> 01:36:48,570
Please.

1265
01:36:55,900 --> 01:36:56,860
You know,

1266
01:36:59,240 --> 01:37:01,240
I read a story when I was a kid.

1267
01:37:02,700 --> 01:37:04,150
The story of two birds.

1268
01:37:06,150 --> 01:37:07,400
Their worlds were different.

1269
01:37:09,860 --> 01:37:14,240
One was made for the skies,
and the other for the cage.

1270
01:37:16,280 --> 01:37:18,570
But they fell in love.

1271
01:37:21,820 --> 01:37:23,360
Even after many efforts,

1272
01:37:25,530 --> 01:37:28,240
...the bird couldn't
live in the cage,

1273
01:37:29,740 --> 01:37:32,320
...nor could the other
one soar in the skies.

1274
01:37:35,360 --> 01:37:37,570
But their love never diminished.

1275
01:37:42,490 --> 01:37:43,400
Maybe...

1276
01:37:45,990 --> 01:37:48,320
Maybe we're like those birds, Dev.

1277
01:37:53,490 --> 01:38:00,240
For years I carried this burden, this
anger, that you never even loved me.

1278
01:38:04,030 --> 01:38:06,200
I never stopped loving you.

1279
01:38:09,490 --> 01:38:11,030
I had to let you go.

1280
01:38:17,990 --> 01:38:20,360
You changed the meaning of love.

1281
01:38:28,320 --> 01:38:29,150
Dev.

1282
01:38:32,360 --> 01:38:33,650
Will you take care of yourself?

1283
01:38:38,320 --> 01:38:40,450
I'll be eagerly waiting
for your next book.

1284
01:38:43,240 --> 01:38:43,900
Okay.

1285
01:39:17,700 --> 01:39:18,530
Let's go.

1286
01:40:05,110 --> 01:40:17,490
"You're the one that
lights up my world."

1287
01:40:19,650 --> 01:40:32,900
"You make my nights and dawn."

1288
01:40:41,650 --> 01:40:46,570
"We'll never part ways..."

1289
01:40:46,990 --> 01:40:52,900
"Never... Never..."

1290
01:40:53,200 --> 01:40:55,360
Their love is out of the world.

1291
01:40:56,820 --> 01:40:59,150
Those who are not destined to meet.

1292
01:41:16,070 --> 01:41:19,070
"We'll never part ways..."

1293
01:41:19,360 --> 01:41:23,610
"Never... Never..."

1294
01:41:24,400 --> 01:41:27,320
"What else can I say..."

1295
01:41:27,490 --> 01:41:31,070
"To you..."

1296
01:41:31,400 --> 01:41:38,990
"You're the one that
lights up my world."

1297
01:41:39,450 --> 01:41:47,650
"You make my nights and dawn."

1298
01:41:48,110 --> 01:41:50,570
"We'll never part ways..."

1299
01:41:51,110 --> 01:41:55,150
"Never... Never..."

1300
01:41:56,320 --> 01:41:59,570
"What else can I say..."

1301
01:42:04,450 --> 01:42:07,240
"You're like a tale..."

1302
01:42:07,450 --> 01:42:11,990
"You're like a sonnet."

1303
01:42:12,240 --> 01:42:19,240
"I want to keep hearing
you night and day."

1304
01:42:20,360 --> 01:42:23,240
"You're my peace of mind..."

1305
01:42:23,400 --> 01:42:27,740
"...the cure to every pain."

1306
01:42:28,360 --> 01:42:35,240
"I can't live a moment without you."

1307
01:42:35,400 --> 01:42:43,110
"You're the one that
lights up my world."

1308
01:42:43,400 --> 01:42:50,740
"You make my nights and dawn."

1309
01:42:52,200 --> 01:42:54,820
"We'll never part ways..."

1310
01:42:55,400 --> 01:42:59,320
"Never... Never..."

1311
01:43:00,360 --> 01:43:02,740
"What else can I say..."

1312
01:43:03,400 --> 01:43:07,150
"To you..."

1313
01:43:08,150 --> 01:43:11,240
"We'll never part ways..."

1314
01:43:11,400 --> 01:43:15,240
"Never... Never..."

1315
01:43:16,360 --> 01:43:18,820
"What else can I say..."

1316
01:43:19,240 --> 01:43:22,900
"To you..."

1317
01:43:23,450 --> 01:43:26,240
"To you..."
