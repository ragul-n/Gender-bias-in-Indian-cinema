1
00:01:00,326 --> 00:01:04,592
12 YEARS BACK...

2
00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:08,093
Ginger & Jaggery.

3
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:31,616
Visakapatnam.

4
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:33,783
There was a colony...

5
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:35,655
..in which there were 2 houses.

6
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:37,619
Bujji lived in one house

7
00:01:37,997 --> 00:01:39,396
and Chitti lived in the other.

8
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:43,633
Bujji likes Chitti...she was his life.

9
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:48,903
He wants to see, talk and
play with her always.

10
00:01:49,008 --> 00:01:50,999
He will do anything for her.

11
00:01:51,177 --> 00:01:52,769
Whatever she says.

12
00:02:01,988 --> 00:02:04,786
Bujji, hit him with a stone.

13
00:02:05,725 --> 00:02:09,058
Should l hit him from the front or back?
- Hit him from behind.

14
00:02:20,406 --> 00:02:22,067
Oh my God!

15
00:02:22,275 --> 00:02:25,073
Someone hit me with a stone.

16
00:02:25,278 --> 00:02:26,711
l'm bleeding.

17
00:02:26,913 --> 00:02:28,278
Who hit you?

18
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:30,176
l don't know.

19
00:02:30,383 --> 00:02:35,912
l was singing alone.

20
00:02:36,122 --> 00:02:39,182
A group song would have been better.

21
00:02:39,392 --> 00:02:42,088
He broke my head like a coconut.

22
00:02:42,362 --> 00:02:44,694
O-ve, a rare blood group.

23
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:49,731
Now, let him know who hit him.

24
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:54,598
Sir, l know who hit you.

25
00:02:54,807 --> 00:02:55,637
Who?

26
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:56,740
Myself.

27
00:02:57,911 --> 00:02:58,775
Run Chitti.

28
00:02:58,978 --> 00:02:59,774
Stop.

29
00:03:00,647 --> 00:03:02,547
He has become very stubborn.

30
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:03,875
Beat him.

31
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:05,380
Father..

32
00:03:05,585 --> 00:03:07,416
Why did you hit him?

33
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:08,416
Why did you hit him?
- Tell me.

34
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:10,111
Chitti told me to hit him.

35
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,623
Did Chitti tell you to hit him?
- Yes.

36
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:13,191
Mr.Venkatrao, it was your
daughter's orders.

37
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:15,054
Why did you do that?

38
00:03:15,662 --> 00:03:18,358
He drinks everyday & beats up his wife.

39
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:20,362
Even yesterday, he hit her so badly
that she started to bleed.

40
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:22,899
Not only that, he has a concubine too.

41
00:03:23,102 --> 00:03:24,126
So Chitti felt bad.

42
00:03:24,337 --> 00:03:25,895
Who is she to feel bad?

43
00:03:26,105 --> 00:03:27,299
lt's his desire to have a concubine.

44
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:29,475
Stop. Don't beat him.

45
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:33,203
Did you hit my husband
for my sake?

46
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:35,472
My good child.

47
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:39,140
lf he comes out again,
hit him with a bigger stone.

48
00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:40,751
Sure.
- Get lost.

49
00:03:40,954 --> 00:03:44,822
l mistook that boy unnecessarily.

50
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:49,586
One day, they had a fight.

51
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:51,388
A big fight.

52
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:55,932
Bujji pleaded but couldn't convince Chitti.

53
00:03:56,135 --> 00:03:58,797
Chitti was very angry.

54
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:02,307
Do you want this guava?

55
00:04:02,508 --> 00:04:03,998
No.

56
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:05,700
Atleast talk to me.

57
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:06,606
No. l won't.

58
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:08,212
l swear l won't talk to you.

59
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:11,881
Please stop.

60
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:13,252
Don't talk to me.

61
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:15,250
Please Chitti.

62
00:04:15,455 --> 00:04:17,082
l said don't talk to me.

63
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:18,850
For how many days?

64
00:04:19,058 --> 00:04:19,786
What?

65
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:23,053
For how many days
shouldn't l talk to you?

66
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,197
Years not days.

67
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:27,195
How many years?

68
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,264
10 to 12 years.

69
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:30,197
10 or 12?

70
00:04:32,171 --> 00:04:32,637
Okay.

71
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:34,397
l won't talk to you till then.

72
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:35,631
What will you give me?

73
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:40,479
l will marry you.

74
00:04:42,682 --> 00:04:44,650
Okay. Deal!

75
00:04:59,365 --> 00:05:00,195
Chitti,

76
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:04,193
Say ''Bye'' once.

77
00:05:05,938 --> 00:05:15,904
BHAVANI

78
00:05:24,457 --> 00:05:26,721
Father, Chitti is angry with me..

79
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,188
..and told me not to talk
to her for the next 12 years.

80
00:05:30,396 --> 00:05:33,854
l can't stay here without
talking to her.

81
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:36,401
So, l'm leaving home.

82
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,501
Forgive me, father.

83
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:40,903
Let's meet in our marriage.

84
00:05:41,607 --> 00:05:43,370
Regards, your Bujji.

85
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:52,708
Hey Bujji..

86
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:55,987
Chitti, what did you do to my Bujji?

87
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:58,487
Tell me the truth.
What did you do to him?

88
00:05:58,691 --> 00:05:59,680
What's your problem?

89
00:05:59,892 --> 00:06:01,052
What? He is gone.

90
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:01,726
Who?

91
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:03,452
My son Bujji has ran away from home.

92
00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:06,257
Chitti, what did you do to my son?

93
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:08,094
Tell me where he did he go?

94
00:06:08,267 --> 00:06:10,064
l beg you. Please tell me.

95
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:13,399
She put a condition

96
00:06:13,606 --> 00:06:15,369
What condition?
What are you talking?

97
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:17,167
He ran away because
of her condition.

98
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:18,776
Why blame my daughter unnecessarily?

99
00:06:18,978 --> 00:06:20,912
Forget all that. Arrest her.

100
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:22,479
Stupid. How can they arrest her?

101
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:24,240
Will you arrest a small girl?

102
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:26,775
You won't find him in any lodge.

103
00:06:26,986 --> 00:06:28,681
Because he has no money.

104
00:06:29,188 --> 00:06:30,086
He is just a small boy.

105
00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:31,449
He will come back.

106
00:06:31,657 --> 00:06:33,591
We know that he is a small boy.

107
00:06:33,793 --> 00:06:34,817
But he doesn't know that.

108
00:06:35,628 --> 00:06:39,155
Hey Chitti!

109
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:40,990
What did you do to my son?

110
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,224
Where did you send him?

111
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:44,926
You made him disappear, but now
concentrating on your studies.

112
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:47,902
Where did my son go?
Where did you hide him?

113
00:06:48,107 --> 00:06:49,005
Tell me.

114
00:06:49,342 --> 00:06:50,366
What's your problem?

115
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:52,877
Why are you after her?

116
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:55,113
Won't you allow her to study?
Will you kill her?

117
00:06:55,314 --> 00:06:56,008
Get inside.

118
00:06:56,215 --> 00:06:57,944
That's my greatest mistake.

119
00:06:58,151 --> 00:07:00,119
l must have killed you all long back.

120
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,048
My bad luck would've ended.

121
00:07:02,288 --> 00:07:03,755
l will kill you all at anytime.

122
00:07:03,956 --> 00:07:05,184
Where is my Bujji?

123
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:07,416
Where did my Bujji go?

124
00:07:08,127 --> 00:07:11,563
Bujji was this tall when l got married

125
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:12,958
He is such a mischievous boy

126
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:16,658
On my first night, he tried to
hit me with a vessel.

127
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:19,304
Brought up by a drunkard father, right?

128
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:23,373
Chitti, where is my son?

129
00:07:23,576 --> 00:07:25,271
Tell me.

130
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:26,775
Tell me.

131
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:31,315
Swinging at late night?

132
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:34,019
Not again.- He is swinging infront
of our house like a ghost.

133
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,380
Where is my son?

134
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:39,820
Hema, take your husband home.
- Have you started again?

135
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:41,425
Stop swinging, come on get down.

136
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:43,822
Where's our Bujji?
- Please take him away. - Come with me.

137
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:45,793
Keep the bag there.

138
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,132
Are you vacating this house?

139
00:07:48,334 --> 00:07:48,993
Can't you see?

140
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:51,261
Are you vacating this house?
Go.

141
00:07:51,537 --> 00:07:55,166
You chased away my only son.
Yourjob is done.

142
00:07:55,374 --> 00:07:57,604
Go.
- Yes, we are leaving to get rid of you.

143
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:01,177
Arrange it properly.- Okay go.
- Go - Come dear.

144
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,439
Get lost!
- We are not going to stay here.

145
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:09,515
Chitti! l'll kill you!

146
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:25,370
May be we shifted to this
place at a wrong time.

147
00:08:25,571 --> 00:08:29,769
l expected my son to become
like legendary Seetharamaraju.

148
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:32,467
So, shifted my family to Vizag.

149
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:36,136
But l never expected he'll also
leave home just like him.

150
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:39,876
He was born during the British rule,
so he became famous.

151
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:41,644
l wonder where he is now.

152
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:44,220
And wonder what he is doing!

153
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,055
l will beat you to pulp.

154
00:08:51,397 --> 00:08:53,558
Hit him. Don't leave him.

155
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:17,947
Hey, don't complicate the fight.

156
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:21,421
Today, my superstar Rajinikanth's film release.

157
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:24,093
l'll come out after watching the show,

158
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:25,924
we can fight later, okay?

159
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:27,356
Okay?

160
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:33,266
How dare he ogles at my sister,
l'm the local don here.

161
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:36,939
Want to watch the morning show?

162
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:39,008
l will show you the climax.

163
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:18,009
Come!

164
00:10:23,489 --> 00:10:33,455
BHAVANI

165
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:47,504
Buddy!

166
00:11:13,572 --> 00:11:14,266
Beat him!

167
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:29,650
You are dead meat now.

168
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:46,299
Buddy, we'll miss first half,
if you fight with him now.

169
00:11:59,318 --> 00:12:01,183
l won't even miss the titles.

170
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:06,347
Whether l punch once or hundred times,
the effect will be the same.

171
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,588
BOSS.....!

172
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:54,730
BHAVANI

173
00:12:59,311 --> 00:13:01,506
O Buddy!

174
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:03,580
He is too good!

175
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:15,627
He's a pathfinder to the
people of this country...

176
00:13:15,828 --> 00:13:21,130
People go mad at his style...

177
00:13:28,507 --> 00:13:38,473
BHAVANI

178
00:14:17,923 --> 00:14:20,892
Hats off to this style,
smile & a stunning walk...

179
00:14:21,093 --> 00:14:23,391
Why are you so jealous?

180
00:14:23,762 --> 00:14:26,492
He is the darling of masses...

181
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:28,894
Hold his flag high...

182
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:36,966
You are the saviour of artists,
fans & the people of Tamil Nadu...

183
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:42,605
You're the role model for
the generations to come...

184
00:15:57,389 --> 00:16:07,355
BHAVANI

185
00:16:22,214 --> 00:16:24,580
What happened?

186
00:16:24,783 --> 00:16:25,750
Why are you crying?

187
00:16:25,951 --> 00:16:29,944
You're going away to Vizag,
l feel very sad.

188
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:33,586
You don't understand my point.

189
00:16:33,792 --> 00:16:35,350
lt's been 12 years.

190
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:36,858
Chitti is waiting for me there.

191
00:16:37,062 --> 00:16:40,031
When you feel so bad for me
guess how sad she must be.

192
00:16:40,232 --> 00:16:43,258
Truth is you spent more time
with me than Chitti.

193
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:46,097
Yes, l was with you
but far away from her.

194
00:16:46,305 --> 00:16:47,101
lsn't there a difference!

195
00:16:48,941 --> 00:16:50,374
Come soon with Chitti.

196
00:16:50,576 --> 00:16:52,271
Sure. l've no job over there.

197
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:54,537
l'll be here on 50th day celebrations.
Okay?

198
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:56,715
Go home.

199
00:16:56,915 --> 00:16:57,540
Buddy...

200
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,218
Stop over reacting. Leave now.

201
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:02,114
Go mind your work.

202
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:14,689
There is a part known as
''Brain'' in our body.

203
00:17:15,434 --> 00:17:18,028
Use it, boys.

204
00:17:18,737 --> 00:17:20,500
When will Godavari come?
- What?

205
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:22,568
Godavari?
- Godavari?

206
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:24,037
Go straight & turn left.

207
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:25,267
You will find an inquiry counter.

208
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:26,944
lt's for people like you, go.

209
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:30,148
Got any idea when will Narasapur will come?

210
00:17:33,852 --> 00:17:34,910
l don't know.

211
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:35,916
l won't tell even if l know.

212
00:17:36,121 --> 00:17:37,918
What will you do?

213
00:17:38,123 --> 00:17:41,286
Staring at me? Will you hit me?

214
00:17:42,594 --> 00:17:45,654
Look at my face & talk.

215
00:17:45,864 --> 00:17:47,889
Look at my face & talk.

216
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,032
Face?

217
00:17:50,202 --> 00:17:52,102
Hey...Bujji.

218
00:17:52,304 --> 00:17:53,794
My Bujji!

219
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:56,331
You ran away from home some years back.

220
00:17:56,542 --> 00:17:57,736
Are you coming back now?
- Yes.

221
00:17:57,943 --> 00:17:58,932
Did you go home?

222
00:17:59,144 --> 00:18:00,509
Meeting me first on arrival?

223
00:18:00,946 --> 00:18:02,880
Your life will be wonderful hereafter.
- My foot!

224
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,014
What are you doing now, Sathi?

225
00:18:04,216 --> 00:18:06,514
Now my name is Tokyo Johnny & not Sathi.

226
00:18:06,718 --> 00:18:07,685
Why did you change your name?

227
00:18:07,886 --> 00:18:10,548
Notjust my name, even my status.

228
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:13,554
My business is spread across
China, Malaysia, Japan & Singapore.

229
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,693
l do only international business.

230
00:18:15,894 --> 00:18:17,293
Let's talk over a coffee.

231
00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:18,019
No.

232
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:19,959
Chitti will give me a cup of filter
coffee once l go home.

233
00:18:20,165 --> 00:18:21,860
Let's go.
- No.

234
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:24,693
Let's have coffee.
- No.

235
00:18:24,903 --> 00:18:25,631
One by two.

236
00:18:25,838 --> 00:18:28,102
There he is.
- Come on boys.

237
00:18:28,373 --> 00:18:30,068
Let's run buddy.

238
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:30,975
Why?

239
00:18:31,176 --> 00:18:33,269
l will tell you later. Escape!

240
00:18:38,517 --> 00:18:38,983
Escape first.

241
00:18:39,184 --> 00:18:39,980
Stop.

242
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:41,820
Run fast.
They will kill me if l get caught.

243
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,385
Stop.

244
00:18:46,158 --> 00:18:47,887
Run buddy.

245
00:18:52,364 --> 00:18:54,332
Beating them is easier
than running so hard.

246
00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:56,433
No. lt's better to escape.

247
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:10,105
BHAVANI

248
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:17,949
You don't know who they are.

249
00:19:19,424 --> 00:19:21,585
He is messing it up.

250
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:23,186
Stop.

251
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:27,623
You rascal.

252
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:30,065
ldiot.

253
00:19:39,745 --> 00:19:40,473
Stop.

254
00:19:41,313 --> 00:19:42,405
Take my belt.

255
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:57,487
Don't hit them.

256
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:58,162
Why?

257
00:19:58,363 --> 00:19:59,990
l beg you.
You don't know who they are.

258
00:20:00,465 --> 00:20:05,027
l don't care who they are.
Once l start to fight, l don't care who it is.

259
00:20:05,237 --> 00:20:07,296
l care about their broken limbs only.

260
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:19,851
Police Control room!

261
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,178
We need backup.

262
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:23,081
We are unable to control a man.

263
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:26,915
Who are you?
- Police.

264
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:29,457
You hit them nonstop
without heeding to my words.

265
00:20:29,661 --> 00:20:31,094
Why are they after you?

266
00:20:31,296 --> 00:20:32,593
What do you do?

267
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:33,822
Do what?

268
00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:35,431
Smuggling! He is a smuggler.

269
00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:36,464
Oh my God!

270
00:20:36,668 --> 00:20:37,999
Does this mean ''Tokyo Johnny''?

271
00:20:39,838 --> 00:20:41,465
How dare you hit the police!

272
00:20:46,211 --> 00:20:48,372
How did you get a cell phone inside the jail?

273
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:50,612
Why don't you say something?

274
00:20:50,816 --> 00:20:52,875
C'mon. Talk.

275
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:54,882
He is now a celebrity inside the jail.

276
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:57,385
Everything is fine here except this.

277
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:58,647
Bowl is of low quality.

278
00:20:58,857 --> 00:21:00,290
Low quality bowl?

279
00:21:00,492 --> 00:21:03,461
l met you first once l got
own from the train.

280
00:21:03,662 --> 00:21:05,289
You invited me for a cup of coffee.

281
00:21:05,497 --> 00:21:07,294
But landed up in central jail.

282
00:21:07,866 --> 00:21:08,491
Go.

283
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:10,798
l want to tell you something.

284
00:21:11,003 --> 00:21:13,028
What?
- l'm jailed for nothing.

285
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:16,005
l didn't commit any crime.

286
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,372
You're right.

287
00:21:19,578 --> 00:21:21,671
None of these guys committed any crime.

288
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,747
We put them in jail for fun.

289
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:25,882
No sir,

290
00:21:26,084 --> 00:21:28,314
lf you give me permission to go out,

291
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,248
l will meet Chitti tomorrow

292
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:30,045
and will be back day after.

293
00:21:30,255 --> 00:21:31,813
Chitti? Who is she?

294
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:35,419
Chitti is my heartbeat.

295
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:37,595
l have 10 such heartbeats.

296
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:40,287
l don't find time to meet them.

297
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:42,292
lt's about my love.

298
00:21:42,501 --> 00:21:45,959
lt's impossible, l said it is impossible.

299
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,934
l'm leaving tomorrow.

300
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:52,201
l informed you for courtesy.

301
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:54,743
You mean you will escape?

302
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,277
Will you escape from jail?

303
00:21:56,481 --> 00:22:01,145
lnforming me about your escape from jail?

304
00:22:02,621 --> 00:22:03,485
No sir...

305
00:22:04,389 --> 00:22:05,947
Who is he, brother?

306
00:22:06,224 --> 00:22:08,488
He is here for beating
10 policemen to pulp.

307
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:10,757
Escape!

308
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:15,724
l will rip your skin off.

309
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:19,997
Will you escape from jail?

310
00:22:20,205 --> 00:22:22,196
Hey...
- What?

311
00:22:22,407 --> 00:22:23,339
Who are you?

312
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:32,073
So, you were leading
a life with little brawls.

313
00:22:32,284 --> 00:22:35,048
ln the city of Chennai.

314
00:22:36,755 --> 00:22:38,620
Boy, go and play there.

315
00:22:38,824 --> 00:22:39,654
We have to talk.

316
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:40,825
Why is he asking me to play?

317
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:42,994
Am l a small boy?
- He is my man. Tell me.

318
00:22:44,429 --> 00:22:45,987
How much did you earn in
all these years in Chennai?

319
00:22:46,631 --> 00:22:49,122
Nothing.

320
00:22:49,334 --> 00:22:50,596
Don't you need money
to live with Chitti?

321
00:22:51,303 --> 00:22:52,600
Yes, l need it.

322
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:55,173
How much do you need?

323
00:22:55,874 --> 00:23:00,334
Rs. 5 lakhs or Rs.
10 lakhs or Rs. 15 lakhs.

324
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,938
Will you give me?

325
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:04,610
l will give you Rs.1 crore.

326
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:10,688
Will you kill a man?

327
00:23:10,922 --> 00:23:18,522
BHAVANI

328
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,789
You & Chitti can live happily.

329
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:25,860
lt's wrong to kill someone for money.

330
00:23:27,806 --> 00:23:30,866
But when it is Rs.1 crore,
it's little tempting.

331
00:23:33,345 --> 00:23:35,370
ls he a good man or a bad man?

332
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:36,706
He's a goon like us.

333
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:39,543
Okay then. Killing such a guy will not
have any emotional feeling.

334
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:40,714
Where is he?

335
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:42,451
l will tell you who it is later.

336
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:47,055
lf you escape from the jail,
this contract is yours.

337
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:48,791
That's your qualification.

338
00:23:49,528 --> 00:23:52,964
Our lawyer will meet you at
the 2nd Dhaba hotel from Vijayawada.

339
00:23:53,165 --> 00:23:56,225
Bujji, tell me if you are afraid.
l will kill him.

340
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:59,063
l will give you Rs.1000 more.
Kill him too.

341
00:23:59,371 --> 00:24:01,396
Why waste money?
l will kill him for free.

342
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:03,073
Buddy...
- What?

343
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:05,068
l would've gone home straight
from the station.

344
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:06,744
But l'm in jail for smuggling.

345
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:08,071
Now, l am forced to
accept a deal to kill.

346
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,510
lf l escape from jail tomorrow,
that will be another case.

347
00:24:10,715 --> 00:24:11,909
l wonder where my Chitti is.

348
00:24:30,535 --> 00:24:33,333
Where are you going?
- To Vizag, mother.

349
00:24:33,538 --> 00:24:35,563
Why?
- To meet Bujji.

350
00:24:36,274 --> 00:24:37,332
He must have come by now.

351
00:24:37,542 --> 00:24:39,339
lf your father knows this,
he will break your legs.

352
00:24:39,711 --> 00:24:45,411
Try to handle it somehow.
But l must go.

353
00:24:45,617 --> 00:24:48,848
Where are you going?
To meet Bujji?

354
00:24:49,287 --> 00:24:52,188
Do you still remember him?
An idiot who ran away from home.

355
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:54,858
He won't even remember
why he ran away from home.

356
00:24:55,393 --> 00:24:59,352
Did l ever behave like a father to you?
l was like your friend.

357
00:24:59,898 --> 00:25:02,526
Will you meet Bujji without caring me?

358
00:25:03,068 --> 00:25:05,536
Don't think that l know nothing
other than real estate.

359
00:25:05,737 --> 00:25:07,364
What she thinks is...

360
00:25:08,073 --> 00:25:09,540
Stop your patch work.

361
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:11,699
No more thinking.

362
00:25:13,144 --> 00:25:15,704
What if we get into this vegetable van?

363
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:17,209
lt might look very cheap.

364

We are no celebrities.

00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:28,884
Why are you carrying
an empty can like that?

366
00:25:30,428 --> 00:25:33,056
Something tells my sixth sense that...

You left the city but he is still

00:28:07,752 --> 00:28:09,379
That isn't your house.

420
00:28:09,754 --> 00:28:11,881
This is my Chitti's house.

421
00:28:12,157 --> 00:28:14,682

00:28:30,241 --> 00:28:33,210
- Who is Chitti?
- l'm your Bujji.

426
00:28:33,411 --> 00:28:35,038
Mother, someone named Bujji is here.

427
00:28:35,246 --> 00:28:36,213
There is no one called Chitti here.

428
00:28:36,414 --> 00:28:38,405
We are here for many years.
You get inside.

429
00:28:38,616 --> 00:28:39,708
Chitti is not here.
What to do now?

430
00:28:39,918 --> 00:28:42,386
Why ask me?
Ask your father instead.

431
00:28:42,587 --> 00:28:43,315
Oh God!

432
00:28:43,755 --> 00:28:44,722

00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:00,398
Bujji...

We used to play here.

440
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:05,967
You used to give me chocolates too.

441
00:29:06,177 --> 00:29:07,439
l never bought anything
to my own son.

442
00:29:07,645 --> 00:29:08,737
How would l have given you?
l don't believe you.

443
00:29:08,947 --> 00:29:10,915
You got drunk & fell down here.
- Yes.

444
00:29:11,116 --> 00:29:13,346
When aunty hit you with a rod,
you had sutures too.

445
00:29:13,551 --> 00:29:14,916
Yes, you did play here.

446
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:19,250
Chitti who used to live next door,
do you know where they are now?

447
00:29:19,457 --> 00:29:22,255
Bloody bitch! She was the reason
for my son to leave the home.

448
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:25,952
l abused them wildly for two long days
and they left unable to tolerate it.

449
00:29:26,164 --> 00:29:28,132
Do you've any idea where they are now?

450
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:30,096

451
00:29:30,668 --> 00:29:32,431
But you'll for one thing.

452
00:29:36,074 --> 00:29:38,372
Take it.
- Thanks boy!

453
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:45,044
lf Bujji had been with me,
he might've been like you if not so tall.

454
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:48,815
He left me, l'm alone,

455
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:50,783
l'm into the debt trap,

456
00:29:50,989 --> 00:29:53,480
had he been with me,
he would've been a support to me.

457
00:29:53,758 --> 00:29:56,454
Debts? How much could it be?

458
00:29:56,661 --> 00:29:58,629
5 or 6 lakhs!

459
00:29:59,264 --> 00:29:59,992

460
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:03,862
Keep these 10 with you.

461
00:30:04,602 --> 00:30:06,297
10? How much is it?

462
00:30:06,504 --> 00:30:08,335
10 means 10 lakhs.

463
00:30:09,607 --> 00:30:15,102
Keep it with you sir, we'll settle it
with Bujji when we find him.

464
00:30:15,713 --> 00:30:19,649
lf you're so good,
how good my Bujji would be then?

465
00:30:20,752 --> 00:30:24,313
You both come and
stay with me tonight,

00:30:24,522 --> 00:30:25,420

00:30:34,299 --> 00:30:36,324
Let's go to my home.

470
00:30:36,901 --> 00:30:40,462

l don't know where your parents are,
but l'll hack them to death.

476
00:30:58,223 --> 00:30:58,848
What nonsense?

477
00:30:59,057 --> 00:31:03,892
You terrorised us when you wore shorts,
now you're wearing jeans,

478
00:31:04,095 --> 00:31:05,357
what have you planned for us now?
l'll rip out your skin.

479
00:31:05,563 --> 00:31:07,394
She's insisting on giving
the phone numbers.

480
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:09,464
Why are you abusing somebody
early in the morning?

481
00:31:09,667 --> 00:31:12,363
A devil came early morning,
Chitti about whom you inquired yesterday.

482
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:13,935
Chitti? Where?

483
00:31:14,138 --> 00:31:16,698
Why are you shouting so loud?
She came to meet Bujji.

484
00:31:16,908 --> 00:31:17,806
l shouted and chased her out.

485
00:31:36,527 --> 00:31:46,493
BHAVANI

486
00:31:52,944 --> 00:31:56,744
Aren't you my Bujji?
Aren't you my son Bujji?

487
00:31:57,815 --> 00:32:01,046
l knew the moment you went out for
Chitti that you're my son Bujji...

488
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:04,115
Yes dad, l'm your son Bujji!

489
00:32:04,522 --> 00:32:06,251
Why didn't you tell me this till now?

490
00:32:07,659 --> 00:32:08,853
Where did you go away?

491
00:32:09,961 --> 00:32:11,826
How could you leave your dad?

492
00:32:13,197 --> 00:32:14,027
l was wrong dad.

493
00:32:14,699 --> 00:32:18,567
l went for Chitti not getting
angry on you, dad.

494
00:32:31,416 --> 00:32:32,542
Please forgive me son.

495
00:32:33,017 --> 00:32:35,281
l misunderstood you.

496
00:32:35,486 --> 00:32:38,046
l knew today how much you love Chitti.

497
00:32:38,256 --> 00:32:41,282
l abused and chased her away.

498
00:32:41,893 --> 00:32:46,227
No dad, l'm happy that
Chitti had come for me.

499
00:32:46,431 --> 00:32:49,889
She said she lives in Hyderabad
and her father is a realtor.

500
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:51,362
l refused to take her phone number.

501
00:32:51,569 --> 00:32:54,197
No problem, l'll go to Hyderabad
and meet Chitti.

502
00:32:54,405 --> 00:32:55,872

Don't tell stepmother.

505
00:32:59,877 --> 00:33:02,903
Passengers to Hyderabad get in,
l don't have much patience.

506
00:33:03,114 --> 00:33:05,082
Had you told your father
that you're Bujji,

507
00:33:05,283 --> 00:33:06,477
you could've got hold
of Chitti very easily.

508
00:33:06,684 --> 00:33:09,517
No problem, let's meet Venkat Rao there,
things will get easy.

509
00:33:09,721 --> 00:33:11,586
You don't get tensed.
- l've no tension.

510
00:33:11,789 --> 00:33:16,453
lf you see Chitti first,
how would you recognize her?

511
00:33:19,731 --> 00:33:21,255
You didn't get me.
- What?

512
00:33:21,466 --> 00:33:25,402
if l see her or if she's near me,

513
00:33:25,603 --> 00:33:27,366

514
00:33:27,572 --> 00:33:30,097
lt'll be like AR Rehman's musical show!

515
00:33:31,242 --> 00:33:33,107

516
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:34,709
Am l not talking to him seriously?

517
00:33:34,912 --> 00:33:36,470
Can't you see it? Stay there.

518
00:33:37,048 --> 00:33:43,544
When l see that girl,
my heart will go mad!

519
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:48,155
Get in!

520
00:33:48,626 --> 00:33:49,183

521
00:33:50,962 --> 00:33:54,363
Buddy, l've another doubt,
you're going in search of Chitti,

522
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:57,227
what if you meet another girl
more beautiful than Chitti?

523
00:33:57,435 --> 00:33:59,403
What if you fall for her?

524
00:33:59,604 --> 00:34:02,095
l don't want any other girl than Chitti.

525
00:34:02,306 --> 00:34:07,266
What if the girl really makes you go mad?

526
00:34:17,255 --> 00:34:27,221
BHAVANI

527
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:34,865

When will the bus reach Hyderabad?

533
00:34:50,788 --> 00:34:55,384
lf the bus doesn't reach Hyderabad at 6,
l'll get you off the bus at 6, right?

534
00:35:01,566 --> 00:35:06,196
You got angry on me while
boarding the bus, right?

535
00:35:10,808 --> 00:35:12,503
ls it necessary to you?
Look straight.

536
00:35:13,878 --> 00:35:17,370
You look very depressed, good!

537
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:22,241
But some girls look very ugly in depressed
mood, but you look great!

538
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:24,648
Continue the cry for some more time,

539
00:35:27,692 --> 00:35:29,216
what are you doing Bobji?

540
00:35:29,427 --> 00:35:31,019
Play a movie.
- Which movie?

541
00:35:31,229 --> 00:35:33,356
Hindi movie.
- No Hindi or English movies please,

542
00:35:33,564 --> 00:35:34,428
play a Rajinikanth film.

543
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:35,826
l played film 'Basha' yesterday.

544
00:35:36,033 --> 00:35:37,193
But l wasn't travelling yesterday.

545
00:35:37,401 --> 00:35:39,494
lmpossible, we too have some rules.

546
00:35:39,704 --> 00:35:42,901
When the Volvo bus is running,

547
00:35:43,441 --> 00:35:44,908
breaking open the window panes,

548
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:47,174
did you ever think that you'll fly out?

549
00:35:48,045 --> 00:35:48,602
Did you?

550
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:50,872
You want me to play 'Basha', right?
- Play!

551
00:36:01,592 --> 00:36:05,028
Watch the film!
Watches all unnecessary things.

552
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:16,438
Move!

553
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:26,049
Take out your purse!
- ls it robbery?- Yes.

554
00:36:26,284 --> 00:36:29,310
There's a Rajinikanth on screen
and one here in the bus.

555
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:33,650
How could you dare board a bus
with two Rajinikanths?

556
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:42,230
l narrated a scene just
a while ago, same feel!

557
00:38:39,617 --> 00:38:41,209
You bashed them all up!

558
00:38:44,755 --> 00:38:46,689
Let's go and have food at Dhaba.
- Will it be good?

559
00:38:46,891 --> 00:38:48,916
l'll be great like your fight.
- Then, let's go.

560
00:38:55,299 --> 00:38:58,393
Two plates of rotis, please.
- Okay, two plates of rotis.

561
00:39:07,778 --> 00:39:10,042
Buddy! Who is Chitti?

562
00:39:19,223 --> 00:39:29,189
BHAVANI

563
00:39:56,694 --> 00:40:00,425
My heart is going for you...

564
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:05,096
...you're mine...

565
00:40:14,211 --> 00:40:23,449
Chitti has come...
The girl has come...

566
00:40:51,482 --> 00:40:53,677
Shattered on seeing me...

567
00:40:53,884 --> 00:40:55,943
One touch and l'm finished...

568
00:40:56,153 --> 00:40:59,645
He plays all over me...

569
00:41:00,758 --> 00:41:05,092
Go boy, have a no-holds-barred ball...

570
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:08,891
Take on me,
tasty country chicken...

571
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:14,370
Never seen anyone like you...
l'm all fired up...

572
00:41:14,572 --> 00:41:18,736
l'll take on you and make you
sweat in pleasure...

573
00:41:32,923 --> 00:41:42,889
BHAVANI

574
00:42:23,173 --> 00:42:31,410
Pounce and loot me...All my nights
are yours...The time is all ours...

575
00:42:32,349 --> 00:42:40,415
Let's make the bliss ours...
Let's have the fun of life...

576
00:42:41,458 --> 00:42:43,585
lt's dangerous for you
to provoke me...

577
00:42:43,794 --> 00:42:50,097
l'll keep any eye on you...
l'll shake up you...

578
00:42:58,342 --> 00:43:08,308
BHAVANI

579
00:43:11,522 --> 00:43:14,491
Chitti! You're not from Vizag, right?

580
00:43:14,692 --> 00:43:17,126
No, l'm from Chilakalur.
- Thank God!

581
00:43:27,671 --> 00:43:28,638
The girl is here. Come...

582
00:43:28,839 --> 00:43:29,635
Hello.

583
00:43:31,542 --> 00:43:32,167
No problem.

584
00:43:32,376 --> 00:43:35,573
Your name?
- Rajinikanth!

585
00:43:37,147 --> 00:43:38,307
Bye.
- Okay.

586
00:43:42,252 --> 00:43:46,848
You went to Vizag despite
my warnings, okay, let's go.

587
00:43:47,825 --> 00:43:50,157
Had a happy journey?
- No.

588
00:43:50,527 --> 00:43:51,721
Can you do something for it?

589
00:43:52,363 --> 00:43:54,228
Tell me, where should we go now?

590
00:43:54,932 --> 00:43:57,366
Did you find Bujji?
- No.

591
00:43:57,801 --> 00:44:03,330
We can buy wrong property
or property with litigation,

592
00:44:03,907 --> 00:44:07,900
we can create documents for sites
which don't have any papers,

593
00:44:08,112 --> 00:44:10,376
how can we create a site
for the documents?

594
00:44:10,581 --> 00:44:12,481
Searching for Bujji is similar to it.

595
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:15,184
Can't you drive if we talk?

596
00:44:20,424 --> 00:44:21,220
Really?

597
00:44:23,927 --> 00:44:25,121
l'm coming there immediately.

598
00:44:34,772 --> 00:44:36,137
Look at this photograph.

599
00:44:37,141 --> 00:44:37,903
Average boy!

600
00:44:38,108 --> 00:44:40,008
He's a software engineer in America.

601
00:44:40,744 --> 00:44:41,938
Your opinion now?

602
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,614
He's very handsome!
- lsn't he?

603
00:44:44,882 --> 00:44:50,047
He runs a real estate business
too along with his software job.

604
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:53,619
Realtor in America!
That enchanted me.

605
00:44:54,558 --> 00:44:57,322
His site and documents are clear.

606
00:44:57,695 --> 00:45:00,391
lf Chitti okays him,
we can go for the registration.

607
00:45:00,597 --> 00:45:03,896
But Chitti may not agree till
the Bujji matter is settled.

608
00:45:04,101 --> 00:45:05,728
Bujji...? Where is Chitti?

609
00:45:05,936 --> 00:45:10,134
Why do girls always show
interest in disputed land?

610
00:45:13,477 --> 00:45:14,307
Where is Chitti?

611
00:45:14,611 --> 00:45:15,942
Sister is in her room.

612
00:45:21,685 --> 00:45:31,651
BHAVANI

613
00:45:37,701 --> 00:45:40,727
Girls spoil their lives with
such nasty dreams.

614
00:45:41,371 --> 00:45:43,601
Dreaming about Bujji, dear?

615
00:45:45,709 --> 00:45:48,735
Tell me next time when he comes in dream,
l need to talk to him.

616
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:50,277
Why?

617
00:45:51,315 --> 00:45:54,614
You're an intelligent girl,
did your MBA in London,

618
00:45:54,818 --> 00:45:56,149
why are you still thinking about Bujji?

619
00:45:56,353 --> 00:45:58,446
Where is he? Ask him to come out.

620
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:02,216
That's why l sent younger sister to
find him before l come here.

621
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:03,950
Did she find him? Did he come here?

622
00:46:04,194 --> 00:46:06,162
How can he come?
He'll come if he's there.

623
00:46:06,363 --> 00:46:09,298
Look my dear,
you need a good husband,

624
00:46:10,033 --> 00:46:13,025
husband must love his wife
and live with her,

625
00:46:13,237 --> 00:46:16,104
he must create a confidence he'll be
with her through thick and thin.

626
00:46:16,306 --> 00:46:18,433
You need a husband like that.

627
00:46:20,844 --> 00:46:22,106
You're right uncle,

628
00:46:22,846 --> 00:46:25,747
l never understood why l loved him
all these days,

629
00:46:26,116 --> 00:46:28,277
now l got it when you said it,

630
00:46:28,385 --> 00:46:33,413
the confidence you mentioned now,
he had created in me as a little boy.

631
00:46:45,869 --> 00:46:48,633
Lions...my sons are lions!

632
00:46:49,273 --> 00:46:50,365
But they are in jail now.

633
00:46:51,008 --> 00:46:52,635
They are in jail for 6 years now.

634
00:46:53,110 --> 00:46:55,874
lt makes me go mad with anger.

635
00:46:58,215 --> 00:47:01,048
l'm crippled in their absence.

636
00:47:01,752 --> 00:47:04,243
Okay, when are you getting them out?

637
00:47:04,788 --> 00:47:06,688
l'm asking you, when will you free them?

638
00:47:06,890 --> 00:47:08,619
lt's not as easy as you think,

639
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:10,225
their sentence is still on,

640
00:47:10,561 --> 00:47:12,791
atleast if their conduct had
been fair enough in jail,

641
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:14,964
l could have got them out
on August 15,

642
00:47:15,165 --> 00:47:18,396
but your sons broke the
heads of 4 other inmates.

643
00:47:21,338 --> 00:47:22,669
You needn't do your duty.

644
00:47:25,075 --> 00:47:28,169
You're on duty here because
l made him a Minister,

645
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:34,310
not only my sons,
l too knocked down many heads.

646
00:47:34,751 --> 00:47:37,379
For your elections,
l think you've forgotten it.

647
00:47:37,588 --> 00:47:40,148
Don't teach me rules and sections.

648
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:43,088
l don't care how you do it,

649
00:47:43,293 --> 00:47:46,729
my sons must be in
my home on August 15!

650
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:49,464
No problem.

651
00:47:50,033 --> 00:47:54,527
l didn't say sorry for slapping you,

652
00:47:54,738 --> 00:47:58,799
no, l fear you may not work
for me keeping it in mind.

653
00:47:59,276 --> 00:48:03,178
l do remember those who work for me
and those who don't also.

654
00:48:04,648 --> 00:48:06,343
Be on it.
- Okay sir.

655
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:07,478
Greetings sir.

656
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:15,321
l must kill Sivanna,
that's my life ambition.

657
00:48:16,093 --> 00:48:20,621
l've been trying for many years now,
but never succeeded till date,

658
00:48:21,031 --> 00:48:25,297
l must see him dead,
l don't mind the cost.

659
00:48:27,504 --> 00:48:29,165
You don't worry darling,
l'll take care of it.

660
00:48:29,373 --> 00:48:30,840
Take your hands off me.

661
00:48:32,342 --> 00:48:34,310
You don't know about Machi Reddy.

662
00:48:35,879 --> 00:48:37,005
Who is this Machi Reddy?

663
00:48:37,214 --> 00:48:38,772
Did you bring him without
any information?

664
00:48:38,982 --> 00:48:40,381
He's Machi Reddy!

665
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:46,183
What's the trouble between
you and Sivanna?

666
00:48:46,390 --> 00:48:49,655
l'll not tell you, got many issues,
you needn't know it.

667
00:48:50,661 --> 00:48:52,288
Will you kill him or not?
- l'll kill him.

668
00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:55,128
Do you know Sivanna?

669
00:48:58,435 --> 00:48:59,834
Have you seen him?

670
00:49:01,672 --> 00:49:04,038
Show Sivanna to him!

671
00:49:19,890 --> 00:49:29,856
BHAVANI

672
00:49:40,844 --> 00:49:41,367
Boss!

673
00:49:41,578 --> 00:49:42,704
Get me a tea.

674
00:49:50,253 --> 00:49:52,983
Though you're hand in glove
with Machi Reddy,

675
00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:55,520
keep out of cornering my boys,

676
00:49:55,859 --> 00:50:00,523
and my real estate business,

677
00:50:07,270 --> 00:50:09,101
go and tell Machi Reddy,

678
00:50:09,573 --> 00:50:12,667
his sons will die immediately
after coming out ofjail.

679
00:50:15,545 --> 00:50:17,570
They are safe in jail only.

680
00:50:18,148 --> 00:50:20,582
Return his service revolver.

681
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:22,511
Take it.

682
00:50:29,092 --> 00:50:33,495
l like police men,
so l'm sparing you.

683
00:50:34,498 --> 00:50:35,487
Be careful!

684
00:50:37,934 --> 00:50:41,028
Why did you fire at him?
l spared him because he's policeman.

685
00:50:41,238 --> 00:50:42,728
He unlocked the gun as you got up.

686
00:50:42,939 --> 00:50:47,774
Will you fire if he does it?
Take him to the hospital.

687
00:50:48,345 --> 00:50:50,711
Stop!

688
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:02,453
Finish him off!

689
00:51:05,395 --> 00:51:07,863
Don't kill me! No!

690
00:51:15,005 --> 00:51:16,632
Should l kill him?
- Yes.

691
00:51:17,507 --> 00:51:20,374
You haven't paid me a crore for nothing,
you've given me an impossible task.

692
00:51:21,545 --> 00:51:22,944
l need Rs.5 lakhs immediately.

693
00:51:23,146 --> 00:51:24,272
l gave you Rs.10 lakhs already.

694
00:51:24,514 --> 00:51:26,846
l didn't see him, had l seen him
l would've asked Rs.50 lakhs.

695
00:51:27,050 --> 00:51:28,210
Look at him!

696
00:51:29,019 --> 00:51:31,647
Rs.5 lakhs please,
or else my brain will go blank.

697
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:33,856
What? Money again?

698
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:35,121
What for he needs it?

699
00:51:35,325 --> 00:51:37,225
His brain will not work without money.

700
00:51:39,162 --> 00:51:42,131
Okay, ask him to come to Savera Plaza,
give him my number.

701
00:51:43,633 --> 00:51:46,363
Wait in the Savera Plaza,
Venkat will pay you there.

702
00:51:46,703 --> 00:51:47,601
Who is Venkat?

703
00:51:47,971 --> 00:51:49,097
Machi Reddy's son.

704
00:51:49,439 --> 00:51:51,202
Wait, l need a clarification.

705
00:51:51,575 --> 00:51:55,067
Two sons are in jail,
he's the third son, right?- Right.

706
00:51:55,879 --> 00:51:58,211
Do you know real estate Venkat Rao?
- No.

707
00:51:58,415 --> 00:52:00,883
Why?
- Just for fun. You go.

708
00:52:08,859 --> 00:52:11,020
Any real estate office here?
- No.

709
00:52:11,228 --> 00:52:13,753
Do you know real estate Venkat Rao?
- No.

710
00:52:17,234 --> 00:52:19,794
When did you come back from London?
- Yesterday.

711
00:52:20,437 --> 00:52:22,598
You promised to come,
why didn't you come to London?

712
00:52:22,806 --> 00:52:24,330
l couldn't come.

713
00:52:30,547 --> 00:52:31,946
Some guy is staring at me.

714
00:52:40,223 --> 00:52:42,851
Not me, l thought he came for me,

715
00:52:43,059 --> 00:52:44,617
for the mannequin, tell me.

716
00:52:44,828 --> 00:52:46,022
What else?

717
00:52:46,596 --> 00:52:49,588
My darling would be in
this size by now.

718
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:52,960
This height would do for me.

719
00:52:53,503 --> 00:52:55,061
l'll hold her like this.

720
00:52:56,273 --> 00:52:59,538
My golden girl, my sweetheart...
- l think he's a jerk.

721
00:52:59,743 --> 00:53:03,270
Where are you darling?
- He's hugging the doll.

722
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:05,982
l'll make my darling wear
the same outfit.

723
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:08,511
Where's the price slip?

724
00:53:09,653 --> 00:53:10,312
Here...?

725
00:53:11,688 --> 00:53:12,882
lt's here!

726
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:17,959
What are you doing?

727
00:53:19,162 --> 00:53:20,754
l'm lifting the skirt to see.

728
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:24,830
The skirt is not yours, right?

729
00:53:26,703 --> 00:53:27,965
What the hell are you talking?

730
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:31,174
l didn't do anything to you,
what's bothering you then?

731
00:53:31,408 --> 00:53:32,670
lnformal address?

732
00:53:35,679 --> 00:53:40,776
l'm not educated like you,
l'm a Chennai fish curry,

733
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:45,117
l'm little smelly,
but will taste great!

734
00:53:45,322 --> 00:53:46,380
What great?

735
00:53:50,493 --> 00:53:52,518
How could they allow such guys
into the complex?

736
00:53:52,729 --> 00:53:54,390
You carry on, l'll talk to him.

737
00:53:54,698 --> 00:53:55,426
Go.

738
00:53:57,033 --> 00:53:57,863
l'll take care.

739
00:53:59,669 --> 00:54:02,638
What man?
Why are you behaving silly?

740
00:54:04,874 --> 00:54:08,742
You're great like a Volvo bus!

741
00:54:09,646 --> 00:54:12,979
Have you seen my bus?
Want to see my chassis number?

742
00:54:13,183 --> 00:54:14,275
May l show it to you?

743
00:54:14,484 --> 00:54:15,644
l'm the latest model.

744
00:54:15,852 --> 00:54:20,482
lsuzu engine! More horsepower!

745
00:54:20,690 --> 00:54:23,181
Not horsepower but arrogance!
Bloody rogue!

746
00:54:29,899 --> 00:54:31,799
When l pat like this,
your nerves will show up,

747
00:54:32,002 --> 00:54:33,993
l can easily catch it,

748
00:54:34,204 --> 00:54:39,665
it seems if l pull, it'll be 100 metres long,
can l pull it out?

749
00:54:43,346 --> 00:54:44,074
Keep quiet!

750
00:54:45,215 --> 00:54:47,149
Where is he?
l'm here for half hour.

751
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:49,213
l can't see Venkat here.

752
00:54:49,452 --> 00:54:51,352
l'm Venkat!

753
00:54:52,155 --> 00:54:54,817
Get up...get up...

754
00:54:58,295 --> 00:55:01,492
Sorry, without knowing it was you
l tried to pull out your nerves.

755
00:55:03,867 --> 00:55:04,629
Take your money.

756
00:55:06,369 --> 00:55:07,427
You have the coffee.

757
00:55:08,238 --> 00:55:10,706
Do you know real estate Venkat Rao?

758
00:55:13,710 --> 00:55:17,168
You went to Bujji's house, right?

759
00:55:17,547 --> 00:55:19,447
Did his parents receive you well?

760
00:55:19,783 --> 00:55:22,183
They used wildest and choicest bad words!

761
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:25,447
l felt like killing myself.

762
00:55:26,323 --> 00:55:30,555
l took it easy because
they were shouting at you.

763
00:55:31,728 --> 00:55:34,322
Forget it, they might be in sorrows.

764
00:55:34,564 --> 00:55:39,001
Wouldn't Bujji be a handsome man now?

765
00:55:39,202 --> 00:55:43,730
l don't know about him but
l did meet a hero in the bus.

766
00:55:43,973 --> 00:55:50,037
Rajinikanth, the fight he did in
the bus was great!

767
00:55:50,246 --> 00:55:54,478
Shut up! l'm asking about Bujji and
you're talking about someone else.

768
00:55:56,453 --> 00:56:03,291
Bujji, my darling,
my sweetheart, my dear...

769
00:56:04,027 --> 00:56:08,521
Where are you?
What are you doing now?

770
00:56:21,144 --> 00:56:31,110
BHAVANI

771
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:41,954
My heart has fallen flat...

772
00:56:42,065 --> 00:56:44,590
You've trapped me in a net, my dear...

773
00:56:46,736 --> 00:56:51,730
Somehow come and join me, my dear...

774
00:56:51,841 --> 00:56:53,934
Show mercy on me,
come to me, my dear...

775
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:59,010
My love....

776
00:57:01,184 --> 00:57:05,712
Must reach you...
What should l do for it?

777
00:57:54,304 --> 00:57:58,934
Wherever l may be...
whatever l may be doing...

778
00:57:59,142 --> 00:58:03,101
You come before me
and tease me...

779
00:58:04,047 --> 00:58:08,507
Let what so ever one may say
and l may hear it...

780
00:58:08,718 --> 00:58:12,848
All l remember is
my sweet little Chitti only...

781
00:58:13,056 --> 00:58:22,692
l must meet him once...
Express my love to him...

782
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:40,506
BHAVANI

783
00:58:48,157 --> 00:58:51,649
Do you know real estate Venkat Rao?
- No sir.- No.

784
00:58:52,195 --> 00:58:53,992
Do you know real estate Venkat Rao?

785
00:58:54,397 --> 00:58:55,125
Venkat Rao?

786
00:58:56,099 --> 00:58:58,431
l don't know.
- Okay.

787
00:58:58,735 --> 00:59:01,033
What is Venkat Rao doing
that nobody knows him?

788
00:59:01,604 --> 00:59:06,234
l'm down and out, my dear
Come to me once my dear...

789
00:59:06,442 --> 00:59:10,503
Come to my dreams and
l'll arouse you...

790
00:59:11,214 --> 00:59:15,742
My childhood mate...
l've been searching you for long...

791
00:59:15,952 --> 00:59:19,979
You're hiding in my heart...

792
00:59:20,189 --> 00:59:23,249
Your thoughts are my lifeline...

793
00:59:24,961 --> 00:59:29,864
Entangle me...

794
00:59:50,386 --> 01:00:00,352
BHAVANI

795
01:00:12,508 --> 01:00:13,497
Do it fast!

796
01:00:14,377 --> 01:00:17,107
Are you a Tamil?
- Yes, brother.

797
01:00:17,714 --> 01:00:19,579
Give me a strong Tamil Nadu tea.

798
01:00:19,782 --> 01:00:21,909
Okay brother,
a strong tea for brother.

799
01:00:22,251 --> 01:00:24,947
How long have you been here?
- 10 years.

800
01:00:25,555 --> 01:00:27,523
House is good, whose house is it?

801
01:00:28,024 --> 01:00:30,151
Sivanna, a mafia don!

802
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:31,122
Does he live here?

803
01:00:31,327 --> 01:00:35,093
No, he lives here in day time only,
at nights he has another house.

804
01:00:35,298 --> 01:00:36,094
Second wife.

805
01:00:36,299 --> 01:00:38,767
Second wife? Really?
- Yes brother.

806
01:00:40,036 --> 01:00:44,769
Do you know real estate Venkat Rao?
- No brother.

807
01:00:45,008 --> 01:00:46,373
Okay, you carry on with your work.

808
01:01:05,995 --> 01:01:07,257
One coffee, please.
- Okay sir.

809
01:01:18,541 --> 01:01:28,507
BHAVANI

810
01:01:35,658 --> 01:01:36,818
Chihuahua?

811
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:39,726
A small dog with red shirt?

812
01:01:39,929 --> 01:01:41,362
With a small tail?

813
01:01:46,636 --> 01:01:48,831
Don't say it's under the basket.

814
01:01:49,138 --> 01:01:51,606
lf you say, you're dead!
- Will you kill me?

815
01:01:51,841 --> 01:01:54,139
lt annoyed me, so l covered it.

816
01:01:56,713 --> 01:02:01,082
lt came and licked me,
l hate getting licked.

817
01:02:01,284 --> 01:02:03,844
Dogs do lick, give it to me.

818
01:02:04,687 --> 01:02:07,178
Wait, this looks different.

819
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:09,688
l'll decide if it's dog or a fox.

820
01:02:11,728 --> 01:02:12,990
What's wrong with you?

821
01:02:13,196 --> 01:02:15,687
You either lift skirts or lift legs to see.

822
01:02:18,401 --> 01:02:19,595
Pervert?

823
01:02:19,802 --> 01:02:22,066
lf you call me a pervert again,
l'll throw this dog.

824
01:02:24,807 --> 01:02:25,899
Who are you?

825
01:02:27,376 --> 01:02:28,400
Will you stab me?

826
01:02:28,845 --> 01:02:30,107
Have you seen my height?

827
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:31,647
You are too small.

828
01:02:31,848 --> 01:02:34,248
l don't know whether to beat you or not.

829
01:02:35,051 --> 01:02:35,608
Take it.

830
01:02:38,454 --> 01:02:38,943
ldiot!

831
01:02:39,155 --> 01:02:44,422
Next time if it licks,
l'll cut the tongue.

832
01:02:44,727 --> 01:02:46,524
Not the dog's but yours.

833
01:02:46,996 --> 01:02:48,020
Get lost idiot!

834
01:02:54,003 --> 01:02:58,838
My Bujji has come back,
he settled all my loans...

835
01:02:59,675 --> 01:03:03,509
l'll go to Bhimavaram
and play card game...

836
01:03:03,713 --> 01:03:04,873
Lift the phone!

837
01:03:05,081 --> 01:03:07,072
Stake money...

838
01:03:10,953 --> 01:03:13,319
Sitting before that unlucky face
will not get any line though.

839
01:03:13,523 --> 01:03:14,251
Dirty face!

840
01:03:20,363 --> 01:03:24,823
Go to Bhimavaram...
- Can't you answer the call?

841
01:03:25,034 --> 01:03:27,093
What's there to enjoy in Bhimavaram?

842
01:03:27,303 --> 01:03:28,998
Why don't you answer the phone?

843
01:03:29,138 --> 01:03:30,662
You answer it.
- Wants to enjoy!

844
01:03:32,208 --> 01:03:34,870
l'm Chitti here, has Bujji come back?

845
01:03:35,077 --> 01:03:38,069
How many times do l've to tell you?
Can't you get it?

846
01:03:38,281 --> 01:03:42,843
No, l want to know about Bujji...
- Cut the line.

847
01:03:46,422 --> 01:03:47,684
What do you eat, food or...

848
01:03:49,826 --> 01:03:50,520
Tell me.

849
01:03:51,427 --> 01:03:55,227
There's a deposit of Rs.5 lakhs
on your name.- Rs.5 lakhs?

850
01:03:56,465 --> 01:03:58,626
Your cheque is ready.

851
01:03:58,835 --> 01:04:00,803
You can get all details from the bank.

852
01:04:01,003 --> 01:04:02,061
First take down my phone number.

853
01:04:02,271 --> 01:04:03,203
One minute madam.

854
01:04:04,540 --> 01:04:05,666
Tell me madam.

855
01:04:11,247 --> 01:04:12,407
What for this number?

856
01:04:12,849 --> 01:04:16,114
A guy named Bujji has deposited
money on your name,

857
01:04:16,319 --> 01:04:19,755
if he calls the number,
we'll deliver the cheque to you.

858
01:04:20,356 --> 01:04:23,519
Do l look like a foolish
mad woman to you?

859
01:04:24,093 --> 01:04:27,256
l'll beat you with slippers, bloody bitch,
hang up the phone.

860
01:04:27,864 --> 01:04:29,695
Bloody lClCl bank!
- Who is it?

861
01:04:29,899 --> 01:04:33,892
Next door Chitti, she played drama
to give her phone number.

862
01:04:34,203 --> 01:04:36,637
She has been a pain in
the neck from childhood.

863
01:04:37,173 --> 01:04:38,037
Oh God!

864
01:04:40,309 --> 01:04:41,003
No change, l'll pay you tomorrow.

865
01:04:41,244 --> 01:04:43,337
Do you know my son's number?

866
01:04:43,613 --> 01:04:45,911
l know he's in Hyderabad but
don't know his phone number.

867
01:04:46,115 --> 01:04:48,049
Chitti has given her phone number.

868
01:04:48,251 --> 01:04:49,582
This must reach him.
How?

869
01:04:49,785 --> 01:04:50,843
Did Chitti give her phone number?

870
01:04:51,053 --> 01:04:51,985
You don't get tensed, uncle,

871
01:04:52,188 --> 01:04:54,748
l'll meet him personally
and give it to him.

872
01:04:55,057 --> 01:04:59,926
We call him as Bujji,
but what is his real name?

873
01:05:00,129 --> 01:05:02,927
Lingaraju!
- Lingaraju?

874
01:05:03,132 --> 01:05:04,360
This is unjust.
- Why?

875
01:05:04,567 --> 01:05:07,365
Your father named you modernly
as Prabhas Raju.

876
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:09,435
but you've named your son
an outdated name Lingaraju.

877
01:05:09,639 --> 01:05:14,474
l named him after my father
as gratitude.

878
01:05:14,677 --> 01:05:16,577
Handover this to him.- Right away!
- You carry on.

879
01:05:20,149 --> 01:05:20,740
ls Chitti there?

880
01:05:20,950 --> 01:05:22,850
Chitti? Just a minute.

881
01:05:23,319 --> 01:05:26,220
See if Chitti is there...it's Sivanna!

882
01:05:28,457 --> 01:05:30,687
She's sleeping.
- She has slept.

883
01:05:31,027 --> 01:05:33,791
l know you all are playing a drama.

884
01:05:34,497 --> 01:05:37,125
Ask her to call me.
- Okay.

885
01:05:40,569 --> 01:05:42,764
What are you doing?
Tell me the progress.

886
01:05:42,972 --> 01:05:44,963
When are you killing him?
- Tonight!

887
01:05:46,142 --> 01:05:47,632
Tonight?
- Yes.

888
01:05:47,944 --> 01:05:48,535
He's going to kill him tonight.

889
01:05:48,744 --> 01:05:51,508
Who is he going to kill?
Ask him the detail.

890
01:05:52,281 --> 01:05:55,148
The man is Sivanna!
No ordinary man!

891
01:05:55,718 --> 01:06:00,712
Bujji is here for two days only,
did you show him the right Sivanna?

892
01:06:00,923 --> 01:06:01,787
Showed him the right Sivanna only!

893
01:06:01,991 --> 01:06:06,690
l have a doubt, ask him again if he's
planning to kill the right man.

894
01:06:06,896 --> 01:06:09,057
Who are going to kill?

895
01:06:09,265 --> 01:06:11,199
Who else? Sivanna!
- Where?

896
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:12,298
Near Moula Ali!

897
01:06:12,501 --> 01:06:13,900
Why would Sivanna come to Moula Ali?

898
01:06:14,203 --> 01:06:17,138
He'll definitely come,
he has a second wife there.

899
01:06:17,340 --> 01:06:21,208
Second wife?
He made the right inquiry.

900
01:06:21,510 --> 01:06:22,568
We too don't know that.

901
01:06:22,778 --> 01:06:25,178
We trust him, don't stop him.

902
01:06:26,349 --> 01:06:29,580
Tell him only one thing,
not to miss him!

903
01:07:13,429 --> 01:07:16,057
lf you see Sivanna,
pull out a gun and fire at him,

904
01:07:16,265 --> 01:07:19,291
brandishing daggers will not
be useful, bloody bastard!

905
01:07:32,081 --> 01:07:35,915
Can't l know if you come to my area
and inquire about me?

906
01:07:36,385 --> 01:07:41,152
Did you fall for the trap of
my second wife and second home?

907
01:07:41,624 --> 01:07:46,186
l don't have any second wife,
l set up this for you.

908
01:07:47,063 --> 01:07:48,963
l came to kill you.

909
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:51,423
May l?

910
01:07:59,508 --> 01:08:00,907
What happened?

911
01:08:01,277 --> 01:08:02,767
l found Sivanna.

912
01:08:03,846 --> 01:08:09,307
But the place is too crowded,
it may take half hour.

913
01:08:09,552 --> 01:08:11,349
Cut the line,
l'll call you after killing him.

914
01:08:12,054 --> 01:08:15,251
Are you blind?
20 people are around you.

915
01:08:15,458 --> 01:08:16,322
So what?

916
01:08:16,759 --> 01:08:19,455
l'm standing before you.
- So what?

917
01:08:19,795 --> 01:08:20,989
Aren't you scared?

918
01:08:21,630 --> 01:08:22,324
What's that?

919
01:08:22,531 --> 01:08:26,160
You're talking like a mad man.

920
01:08:26,368 --> 01:08:29,531
l'm not mad, l'm perfect.

921
01:08:29,839 --> 01:08:32,171
l came to kill you.

922
01:08:33,442 --> 01:08:37,708
l've killed many till now,

923
01:08:38,781 --> 01:08:41,011
but never killed a man with
an unstable mind.

924
01:08:51,694 --> 01:08:54,060
Boys! Kill him!

925
01:09:00,269 --> 01:09:10,235
BHAVANI

926
01:09:14,083 --> 01:09:17,348
Don't fire! He looks very interesting!

927
01:09:17,853 --> 01:09:19,878
Not with gun but kill him.

928
01:09:31,267 --> 01:09:33,462
Order tea for me.

929
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:52,587
Order a strong tea!
