1
00:00:29,843 --> 00:00:34,848
British Atrocitãþile not ended
when they started to kill and rob

2
00:00:34,883 --> 00:00:39,478
... and to remove prey
precious in the country.

3
00:00:46,526 --> 00:00:50,485
And you hurry up! Load the washing machine!
Put it in the back ...

4
00:00:58,872 --> 00:01:02,542
I took all their possessions.
What about people knew ã?

5
00:01:02,577 --> 00:01:07,846
I thought Not yet.

6
00:01:07,881 --> 00:01:12,511
Think about it quickly.
If King Azad Singh was ...

7
00:01:12,886 --> 00:01:18,847
as a country estate jefuiþi
not drop to life.

8
00:01:19,559 --> 00:01:23,859
Do not worry us.
Think about which I will survive.

9
00:01:25,899 --> 00:01:27,867
Prepares you to go to the airport.

10
00:01:29,903 --> 00:01:32,872
Put them on the list of martyrs!

11
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:40,599
Congratulations King!
A prince was born.

12
00:02:41,641 --> 00:02:43,939
Will Seaman.

13
00:02:52,986 --> 00:02:55,955
Here is a gift from me.

14
00:02:56,990 --> 00:03:01,620
King ...
- Fool!

15
00:03:01,995 --> 00:03:03,962
What happened?

16
00:03:03,997 --> 00:03:07,000
British attack
fort and looted everything.

17
00:03:07,035 --> 00:03:09,969
They left after they have killed many people.

18
00:03:52,045 --> 00:03:54,012
Continue to rob lndia.

19
00:03:54,047 --> 00:03:57,050
The country this fall -
the more you will climb you.

20
00:03:57,085 --> 00:03:59,018
I will recommend for promotion.

21
00:05:49,162 --> 00:05:51,790
Forgive me king.

22
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:58,126
Find mercy from
of innocent people after you.

23
00:06:08,181 --> 00:06:12,811
On and s!
I'll leave you nor I will.

24
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:20,489
I've seen since atrocitãþile way.

25
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:24,530
You have plundered the wealth of King Azad Singh
Get your killed and subjected and ii.

26
00:06:24,565 --> 00:06:27,165
Who's responsible for it?
You ... or ...

27
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,870
Azad Singh.
- Addresses them up with King Singh Azad.

28
00:06:30,905 --> 00:06:32,837
Not King. It would be called a traitor.

29
00:06:32,872 --> 00:06:35,840
He was revolted against the British government.

30
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:39,834
Putting to the test and self-esteem
you have instigated the revolt.

31
00:06:40,213 --> 00:06:43,716
It appears that you have been instigated by him,
Running Elena cousins.

32
00:06:43,751 --> 00:06:46,970
You have a weakness for Azad Sing
and everyone knows.

33
00:06:47,005 --> 00:06:50,189
In college, you and Azad
eraþi very apropiaþi friends.

34
00:06:51,224 --> 00:06:56,229
Do not forget that I came here with permission
My husband, Governor Philips

35
00:06:56,264 --> 00:06:58,231
to investigate this issue.

36
00:06:58,266 --> 00:07:00,198
Investigative indeed!

37
00:07:00,233 --> 00:07:04,237
And that a murderer - and the one at
Why hide from us.

38
00:07:04,272 --> 00:07:06,871
Only thieves to hide, Dyer.

39
00:07:06,906 --> 00:07:09,534
Floating above the enemies death.

40
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:22,553
Ticãlo and i! I want to avenge the blood
s and subjected me.

41
00:07:22,588 --> 00:07:26,592
Rather, King Singh Azad.
This country has seen enough blood.

42
00:07:26,627 --> 00:07:30,930
If you do not suporþi
White blood, Lady Helen ...

43
00:07:30,965 --> 00:07:33,899
why I subjected to blood and support my s?

44
00:07:34,267 --> 00:07:36,901
If we all shed the blood of one another ...

45
00:07:36,936 --> 00:07:40,606
maybe one day, the sacred waters and Gang
Yamuna will turn into blood.

46
00:07:40,641 --> 00:07:42,573
Thi stops you desire revenge.

47
00:07:42,608 --> 00:07:46,946
I promise to demand justice
for you my government.

48
00:07:46,981 --> 00:07:49,799
We do not want pity.
We want our right.

49
00:07:49,834 --> 00:07:52,583
I promise.
Îþi you get right.

50
00:07:52,618 --> 00:07:57,102
But promising that I want to
you will not fight them.

51
00:07:57,137 --> 00:08:01,586
Îþi my word, Lady Helen.
I'll start the fight.

52
00:08:14,307 --> 00:08:16,274
No, Simon!
I gave my word.

53
00:08:16,309 --> 00:08:20,268
You gave thi word, Elena.
We do not! Take it.

54
00:08:22,315 --> 00:08:27,275
Ticãlo and s! You attacked from behind.

55
00:08:30,323 --> 00:08:35,328
Alive or dead. 20,000 reward
Azad Singh for his capture

56
00:08:35,363 --> 00:08:37,296
At a party.

57
00:08:37,997 --> 00:08:42,335
No Indian will betray another Indian
for 20 or 25 thousand rupees.

58
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:46,339
And Singh Azad and will cost more.
E King.

59
00:08:46,374 --> 00:08:48,637
In the past.
Now there's a king.

60
00:08:49,342 --> 00:08:53,679
But how to get him?
- You can help me.

61
00:08:53,714 --> 00:08:55,647
But you're Indian.

62
00:08:56,015 --> 00:08:58,851
Half of my Indian blood is water.

63
00:08:58,886 --> 00:09:01,687
The other half is pure British.

64
00:09:01,722 --> 00:09:03,988
What do you want the reward?

65
00:09:04,023 --> 00:09:08,653
Not much ... just ...
see that white shack?

66
00:09:11,697 --> 00:09:13,664
Shack?
That's a palace!

67
00:09:13,699 --> 00:09:18,336
Sir, for you it's just a shack!
Has 100 rooms!

68
00:09:18,371 --> 00:09:24,332
If I give to that palace, I bring you
and the ta-su to your feet

69
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:26,677
Accept.

70
00:09:26,712 --> 00:09:28,679
But how do you catch?

71
00:09:28,714 --> 00:09:31,863
I will not catch. You'll catch it.

72
00:09:31,898 --> 00:09:35,013
I was just sleeping, I will manage.

73
00:09:39,058 --> 00:09:41,356
It seems that the doctor comes.

74
00:09:50,403 --> 00:09:52,371
Come on please.

75
00:09:53,406 --> 00:09:56,374
Sorry, King.
Reþinut I was little.

76
00:09:56,409 --> 00:10:01,414
And I thought in the past,
Your half British ...

77
00:10:01,449 --> 00:10:04,715
It's not as king.
Why do you say to something like that?

78
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:07,753
Undoubtedly, half
British blood is water

79
00:10:07,788 --> 00:10:10,722
But the other half is pure Indian.

80
00:10:13,092 --> 00:10:15,059
This is very deep wound.

81
00:10:15,094 --> 00:10:20,398
It would have been deep
if I enter the chest.

82
00:10:20,433 --> 00:10:23,732
It's just a small wound.
Use the knife to bullet Scotland.

83
00:10:47,793 --> 00:10:50,428
Bahadur! What's this?

84
00:10:50,463 --> 00:10:53,091
What animal keep angry?

85
00:10:55,134 --> 00:10:58,433
Animal yes, but it's very faithful.

86
00:10:58,804 --> 00:11:01,500
Bear no needle shoved his master.

87
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,778
This is the last.

88
00:11:14,153 --> 00:11:18,456
Someone once so heavy.
Thi can not pay any fee.

89
00:11:18,491 --> 00:11:24,163
A long life to you. Not only fees -
'll receive your property for life.

90
00:11:24,198 --> 00:11:28,122
Good King. Goodbye
- Thanks, buddy.

91
00:11:29,502 --> 00:11:32,130
When you return?

92
00:11:32,505 --> 00:11:38,466
You will not need now.
King ended treatment.

93
00:11:40,513 --> 00:11:45,473
Sir, do miracles.

94
00:11:53,859 --> 00:11:55,827
What happened to ...?

95
00:11:56,195 --> 00:11:57,822
I feel ameþit.
- God!

96
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,516
Durga, the enemies have surrounded us!

97
00:12:18,551 --> 00:12:20,886
Get it on our son
and get out of here immediately.

98
00:12:20,921 --> 00:12:23,889
Bahadur will be with you.
Do not refuse, Durga.

99
00:12:23,924 --> 00:12:26,187
We can not risk the life of our son.

100
00:12:29,895 --> 00:12:33,899
Durga. Today is our child's baptism.

101
00:12:33,934 --> 00:12:37,528
I'll do it before you send it.

102
00:12:44,243 --> 00:12:46,541
No.
I can see it.

103
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:50,548
But tomorrow everyone
I will see and wonder ...

104
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:56,255
give the name of the woman who was born
this man fearless.

105
00:12:56,290 --> 00:13:00,555
A man who smiles!

106
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:04,559
Leave Bahadur! Your back goes
responsibility for my clan.

107
00:16:13,786 --> 00:16:16,414
Whose child is that I brought a horse?

108
00:16:49,488 --> 00:16:51,455
What is my face?

109
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:55,119
I left the child here.
Where's my baby?

110
00:16:55,828 --> 00:16:59,787
I have not seen any children there.
- Whew!?

111
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,468
Do not you bring any child!

112
00:17:05,838 --> 00:17:07,806
So where has my baby gone?

113
00:17:08,507 --> 00:17:10,805
Who took my baby?

114
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:14,809
Where's my baby ...?

115
00:17:38,203 --> 00:17:41,874
Glad you came. Hold kid.
- Whose is it?

116
00:17:41,909 --> 00:17:44,502
I do not know.
The horse brought him.

117
00:17:46,545 --> 00:17:49,548
It's the same horse that brought
that kid at the orphanage!

118
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:52,176
And British soldiers watching him.

119
00:17:52,551 --> 00:17:56,202
This means that the child's life
is in danger.

120
00:17:56,237 --> 00:17:59,854
Nor can we teach children
this to the police.

121
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:03,193
And if he keeps next to us.

122
00:18:03,228 --> 00:18:07,900
I went to the temple of Goddess Durga's
I will pray for a child.

123
00:18:07,935 --> 00:18:10,528
She probably put my kid in her lap.

124
00:18:10,903 --> 00:18:14,538
Well. We will keep this baby.

125
00:18:14,573 --> 00:18:18,873
But jamun seeds not know what is!

126
00:18:25,584 --> 00:18:29,922
Azad Singh dared Traitor
to challenge the British government.

127
00:18:29,957 --> 00:18:33,943
We will punish in such a way that nobody ...

128
00:18:33,978 --> 00:18:37,895
will not dare to make his mistake.

129
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:43,083
The assessment compared the effort
Dr. Harry, the Government.

130
00:18:43,118 --> 00:18:48,236
Entitling her gift this
palace and give him the title of 'Sir'.

131
00:18:51,276 --> 00:18:54,613
Everybody praises UK
Hold-and that word, Sir.

132
00:18:54,648 --> 00:18:56,615
And when will come a proof of treason ...

133
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:58,583
will ruin the world.

134
00:18:59,618 --> 00:19:02,586
But you will not have the luck to see anything like this.

135
00:19:02,621 --> 00:19:10,629
Maybe not, but my son
will result in a day.

136
00:19:10,664 --> 00:19:13,597
It will avenge for your betrayal.

137
00:19:13,632 --> 00:19:16,968
And revenge
and elãtoria for the British.

138
00:19:17,003 --> 00:19:20,305
Will shake foundations of the British Empire.

139
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:23,274
Ordonaþi, Sir!

140
00:19:33,318 --> 00:19:38,620
Start!
Drag it to death ...!

141
00:19:40,993 --> 00:19:44,952
Lndia mother live!

142
00:20:09,688 --> 00:20:11,989
Whose policy stops you from you?

143
00:20:12,024 --> 00:20:17,029
High Command has decided that
Azad Singh may not be killed.

144
00:20:17,064 --> 00:20:19,998
It can be imprisoned.
These are the orders.

145
00:20:20,699 --> 00:20:22,667
Dezlegaþi it.

146
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:29,006
It's not fair to beg you for my life.

147
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:33,045
Death of Azad Singh today
had given birth to Althea 1000 Azad Singh

148
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,012
to free India.

149
00:20:35,047 --> 00:20:39,718
Not Singh Azad. Your life
is expensive for your people.

150
00:20:39,753 --> 00:20:45,724
His death will not affect the British government.

151
00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:49,359
Take it.
- Do not be proud, cuz Dyer.

152
00:20:49,394 --> 00:20:53,330
Nobody knows
how to change things.

153
00:20:58,737 --> 00:21:02,372
Drive more slowly.

154
00:21:02,407 --> 00:21:05,910
Learned to drive -
He does not even license.

155
00:21:05,945 --> 00:21:09,379
Sir Harry, it's your face
No license needed.

156
00:21:09,414 --> 00:21:11,750
It has no importance
if killing 2 or 4 people.

157
00:21:11,785 --> 00:21:14,051
A and E. But if the wounds and you?

158
00:21:14,086 --> 00:21:17,055
A bodyguard is always with her, Sir.

159
00:21:54,459 --> 00:21:58,395
Come Badal.
Let it start today.

160
00:23:10,535 --> 00:23:14,471
Mrs You see, this is called the hunter.

161
00:23:14,873 --> 00:23:18,809
It's used on wild animals
and bad people.

162
00:23:20,879 --> 00:23:23,473
I know and I use.

163
00:23:24,549 --> 00:23:28,178
If you grab it, cut you everywhere.

164
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:34,859
If you love and you move them and I will not do.

165
00:25:06,985 --> 00:25:10,921
I put the bodyguard in the car.

166
00:25:11,323 --> 00:25:13,291
And you ...!

167
00:25:13,992 --> 00:25:18,330
Let pride and apologize cereþi
that you gave to the machine over it

168
00:25:18,365 --> 00:25:20,297
Sorry! Why?

169
00:25:20,332 --> 00:25:24,336
I come from England,
but did not know what kind of people are here.

170
00:25:24,371 --> 00:25:26,303
Poor people deliberately fall
as washing our hands.

171
00:25:26,338 --> 00:25:30,342
If heaven is broken foot 5000 -
if you break your hand ... 10,000.

172
00:25:30,377 --> 00:25:33,310
And if you die, may require up to 50,000!

173
00:25:33,345 --> 00:25:42,654
Life is so worth it
Thi can not imagine that.

174
00:25:45,023 --> 00:25:48,360
Nothing to do than to tell you
hands together and asking for forgiveness.

175
00:25:48,395 --> 00:25:53,365
You talk as if it
the same rank with me-ta.

176
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,999
You can think of and a.

177
00:25:56,034 --> 00:25:59,003
For me, any parent
s mother, and the So ...

178
00:25:59,704 --> 00:26:03,375
You can not leave until you ask him for forgiveness.

179
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:05,343
Go ahead, ask for forgiveness.

180
00:26:06,378 --> 00:26:09,679
Well.
Forgive me.

181
00:26:16,314 --> 00:26:21,726
Can not talk. But despite
what I see pain on his face ...

182
00:26:21,761 --> 00:26:24,062
Her face says go, I forgive you.

183
00:26:24,097 --> 00:26:26,030
You can leave now.

184
00:26:27,065 --> 00:26:29,363
You go to the hospital.

185
00:26:30,402 --> 00:26:34,361
It's necessary.
These wounds should be treated.

186
00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:41,038
Hey Moti.
Take care of my mother.

187
00:26:42,414 --> 00:26:45,394
What's your name?

188
00:26:45,429 --> 00:26:48,375
A common name - Mard -

189
00:26:58,430 --> 00:27:02,457
Who feels the pain of others -
man's true.

190
00:27:02,767 --> 00:27:06,066
Today, instead of Raju Tongawala
Mard Tongawala îþi we say.

191
00:27:07,105 --> 00:27:10,074
What about Mom?
Let's keep that name?

192
00:27:39,127 --> 00:27:46,443
I am Tongawala Mard ...

193
00:27:47,145 --> 00:27:51,445
Enemies can hurt me not,
God is with me.

194
00:31:59,731 --> 00:32:04,327
Hey Badal. Are you drunk?
We have to go on.

195
00:32:07,405 --> 00:32:12,707
I told you to go to hospital.
Hey, come back.

196
00:32:19,417 --> 00:32:22,011
Orphanage!
Why are you here?

197
00:32:27,091 --> 00:32:29,726
Badal Hey!
What about you?

198
00:32:29,761 --> 00:32:32,730
Instead of the hospital, we brought you here?

199
00:32:44,776 --> 00:32:47,410
What is my son?

200
00:32:47,445 --> 00:32:50,414
I do not know why I brought the horse here!

201
00:32:54,786 --> 00:32:57,755
Mom, what are you doing there?

202
00:32:58,122 --> 00:33:02,827
Now many years and has left the child there.

203
00:33:02,862 --> 00:33:05,387
Nobody knows who took it.

204
00:33:07,465 --> 00:33:10,764
But Badal ...
why she came here ...?

205
00:33:20,812 --> 00:33:23,446
Brother Raju!
Come quickly.

206
00:33:23,481 --> 00:33:25,449
Harry and Simon tries
us to demolish slums.

207
00:33:29,487 --> 00:33:33,787
Mom. Ramu takes you to the hospital.
I have to go.

208
00:33:37,495 --> 00:33:42,500
There's something new.
It has turned into another Jalianwalan Bagh

209
00:33:42,535 --> 00:33:46,002
And stains on here
innocent blood.

210
00:33:46,037 --> 00:33:49,469
People slum.
This is the last warning.

211
00:33:50,174 --> 00:33:54,846
Do not Be încãpãþânaþi. You do not have guns.
You can not sit in front of that gun.

212
00:33:54,881 --> 00:33:57,814
I do not like, but I give
life for our land.

213
00:33:57,849 --> 00:34:06,450
The British government is not cannon to
to silence 400 million Indians.

214
00:35:48,626 --> 00:35:50,924
Get the þâncul him.

215
00:36:08,646 --> 00:36:10,648
What's happening here?

216
00:36:10,683 --> 00:36:13,616
Revolt.

217
00:36:13,651 --> 00:36:15,618
Revo!
Why?

218
00:36:15,653 --> 00:36:19,323
Even after a notification
previously refused to leave the neighborhood.

219
00:36:19,358 --> 00:36:21,290
You're refusal to name their rebellion!

220
00:36:21,325 --> 00:36:23,995
You order the judge to drain your neighborhood?

221
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:26,295
We lead the country, Elena.

222
00:36:26,330 --> 00:36:31,002
How to take down and how to build
should not have orders for it.

223
00:36:31,037 --> 00:36:33,021
General Dyer is right.

224
00:36:33,056 --> 00:36:34,971
You're the mayor of the city.

225
00:36:35,006 --> 00:36:37,270
A mayor must build your city
not to destroy it.

226
00:36:39,343 --> 00:36:44,014
City trash removal
does not mean its destruction.

227
00:36:44,049 --> 00:36:48,686
If you hate so much misery
you build houses on the poor -

228
00:36:48,721 --> 00:36:50,987
should have
construct your schools to children -

229
00:36:51,022 --> 00:36:54,025
hospitals for those who die without
medical care ...

230
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:56,360
instead you shoot people neînarmaþi.

231
00:36:56,395 --> 00:36:58,661
This discussion is pointless, Mrs.

232
00:36:58,696 --> 00:37:02,033
When we demolish slums
to build a zoo that

233
00:37:02,068 --> 00:37:04,035
to house animals
around the world.

234
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:06,335
That's not a bad thing.

235
00:37:06,370 --> 00:37:12,339
Yes. Slavery is not enough.
Sclavageste and animals.

236
00:37:12,374 --> 00:37:18,308
As to you as animals and slaves,
not just Indians.

237
00:37:18,716 --> 00:37:22,351
Because these fools
Our country does not advance.

238
00:37:22,386 --> 00:37:25,389
But when the Zoo will be
built here, the same people ...

239
00:37:25,424 --> 00:37:27,323
No DNA, no ...

240
00:37:28,392 --> 00:37:33,362
When it's done, the entry will is written ...

241
00:37:33,397 --> 00:37:35,331
"It is forbidden to enter
dogs and the Indians. "

242
00:37:45,409 --> 00:37:51,006
It seems that you are the spark
I saw it and years ago.

243
00:37:51,749 --> 00:37:53,717
Let him go.

244
00:37:57,755 --> 00:38:01,724
All damages suffered by people
slum will be borne by you.

245
00:38:01,759 --> 00:38:07,356
And if this guy is still harassed
you-lose mayoral Thi.

246
00:38:08,766 --> 00:38:13,402
For the first time I see a white heart.

247
00:38:13,437 --> 00:38:18,374
I made something for you
I did not even for a Brit -

248
00:38:20,444 --> 00:38:22,378
Thanks.

249
00:38:23,447 --> 00:38:27,383
Mrs Helen Long Life.

250
00:38:47,471 --> 00:38:52,476
Look how are you and your luggage
no truck you could not.

251
00:38:52,511 --> 00:38:57,114
Well, if you want to go, no nonsense.
- Just kidding. Wait.

252
00:38:57,149 --> 00:38:59,081
Where do you go?
- In Hell.

253
00:38:59,116 --> 00:39:01,819
You just want to go or
May and return to you.

254
00:39:01,854 --> 00:39:04,453
For now go with us.

255
00:39:04,488 --> 00:39:07,089
Just before Mayor Harry
when you return.

256
00:39:07,124 --> 00:39:12,129
If you touch any tongawala
We fight to the death.

257
00:39:12,164 --> 00:39:15,097
Wait ...!
Nobody wants to play with his life.

258
00:39:15,132 --> 00:39:20,764
I want to see what needs his face
Harry and the Englishman can not do.

259
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:25,434
You wanted to go to hell, right?
- Yes. - Go ahead.

260
00:39:34,852 --> 00:39:39,822
So, you are to the owner
the palace .-

261
00:39:39,857 --> 00:39:43,160
Mayor Harry - who wanted to demolish
neighborhood and leave us homeless.

262
00:39:43,195 --> 00:39:46,152
What father could not -
his face wants to do that?

263
00:39:47,164 --> 00:39:50,980
No. I understood you wrong.
I called from another cause.

264
00:39:51,015 --> 00:39:54,797
If you called me to see your
body, I've never seen.

265
00:39:55,172 --> 00:39:57,875
Tell me if you have another job -
otherwise have to go to my business.

266
00:39:57,910 --> 00:40:03,547
Îþi know affairs.
You're related to you all day Tonga

267
00:40:03,582 --> 00:40:05,514
How tigi headset?

268
00:40:05,549 --> 00:40:07,483
As many as needed.

269
00:40:07,885 --> 00:40:10,854
Way hay and I get food.

270
00:40:11,889 --> 00:40:15,559
God wake me hungry
but let me sleep and all of a.

271
00:40:15,594 --> 00:40:19,196
I gain the honorable existence.
I'm not asking for charity.

272
00:40:19,231 --> 00:40:21,824
After talking seem very arrogant.

273
00:40:22,199 --> 00:40:24,827
It's not arrogant, but self-esteem.

274
00:40:25,903 --> 00:40:30,203
Maybe your big palace
but she and my self respect.

275
00:40:32,209 --> 00:40:37,214
I like it. But I want to make even greater.

276
00:40:37,249 --> 00:40:39,734
I want to make my body guard.

277
00:40:39,769 --> 00:40:42,184
Do not accept your job, Mrs.

278
00:40:42,219 --> 00:40:44,725
No servant, no matter how large is

279
00:40:44,726 --> 00:40:48,226
and can not lift head
above the master's shoes.

280
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:51,595
May thinks you up. My ears
are not ordinary to hear denials.

281
00:40:51,630 --> 00:40:55,190
My lips are common not to say yes.

282
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:58,602
No doubt that is
born in a country of slaves.

283
00:40:58,637 --> 00:41:02,538
But my heart will not
never accept slavery.

284
00:41:18,956 --> 00:41:23,926
You have the power to hotãrâþi Mrs.
Do the way it wants you.

285
00:41:23,961 --> 00:41:28,898
Thanks to my heart will be when you cry
tears asking me to stop.

286
00:41:45,983 --> 00:41:47,950
Stop.

287
00:41:47,985 --> 00:41:49,987
If you're tired, you can rest a little.

288
00:41:50,022 --> 00:41:52,251
Are linked.
I can not run.

289
00:42:01,999 --> 00:42:06,265
Make sure my flogging
Thi causes the beats not in your hand.

290
00:42:07,304 --> 00:42:11,008
Look carefully.
- BÃ and let him be here in my hand.

291
00:42:11,043 --> 00:42:14,529
But the wounds of my heart will be alleviated.

292
00:42:14,564 --> 00:42:17,980
Wounded hearts are not alleviated, burn.

293
00:42:18,015 --> 00:42:22,611
If my heart burn
standby and they will make your wounds.

294
00:42:41,038 --> 00:42:44,633
What are you done?
Do not feel pain?

295
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:49,304
An iron man pain-Mrs.

296
00:42:50,047 --> 00:42:53,315
Mahatma Gandhi started an action.

297
00:42:53,350 --> 00:42:58,705
The blood of thousands of martyrs
was spilled that day in the salt.

298
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:04,026
This rubbing salt mix
with my blood of martyrs.

299
00:43:04,061 --> 00:43:09,658
Traitors can burn wounds.
It can burn wounds of the loyal.

300
00:43:13,370 --> 00:43:15,668
What's happening, baby?

301
00:43:16,373 --> 00:43:21,712
It's too proud.
I want to bring him to his feet.

302
00:43:21,747 --> 00:43:25,341
Leave that to us.

303
00:43:25,716 --> 00:43:31,018
Prepares you up. General Dyer comes
to tell you see the dance tonight.

304
00:43:37,094 --> 00:43:42,227
Lady Helen has saved you that day.

305
00:43:42,262 --> 00:43:47,360
Today, my daughter will destroy îþi pride.

306
00:44:13,430 --> 00:44:15,728
I agree with your daughter.

307
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:21,727
We decided that your daughter Ruby
My son will marry David.

308
00:44:22,773 --> 00:44:26,777
It is a matter of pride for me.
They ask Ruby.

309
00:44:26,812 --> 00:44:28,745
What to ask?

310
00:45:36,513 --> 00:45:38,504
Do not move anyone.

311
00:46:43,580 --> 00:46:46,208
No.
Leave me.

312
00:46:58,295 --> 00:47:01,230
Tell me mrs.
How do you feel up there?

313
00:47:04,301 --> 00:47:06,895
The body burns.

314
00:47:07,604 --> 00:47:10,607
But thousands of flowers are blooming in my heart.

315
00:47:10,642 --> 00:47:13,235
And each flower said ...

316
00:47:15,612 --> 00:47:21,244
There is modest to say.
However I can not stop to say.

317
00:51:36,539 --> 00:51:38,507
You exit it to make love?

318
00:51:38,875 --> 00:51:41,173
Nor would you get you lose milk teeth.

319
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:45,848
Do you bite that?

320
00:51:50,553 --> 00:51:54,853
What you wish you is shared,
not bite.

321
00:51:55,892 --> 00:51:58,193
When shared with me.

322
00:51:58,228 --> 00:52:00,856
Every fiber of my body wants you.

323
00:52:02,899 --> 00:52:06,858
Touch the strings transforms
the bud in bloom.

324
00:52:07,570 --> 00:52:11,908
You turn into flower po DNA
but you're too young for that.

325
00:52:11,943 --> 00:52:15,912
You are not logged yet finished puberty.
YouTube has not appeared.

326
00:52:15,947 --> 00:52:18,881
If something happens, it will be doomed.

327
00:52:19,916 --> 00:52:21,884
What will happen?

328
00:52:23,586 --> 00:52:25,213
Tell him.
How to explain?

329
00:52:27,257 --> 00:52:31,559
Poor girl.
You do not know.

330
00:52:31,594 --> 00:52:35,894
If you are under 18, this man
cavity kid will stay in seven years.

331
00:52:38,601 --> 00:52:41,570
And if not?

332
00:52:42,272 --> 00:52:45,241
Then ...
- Yes?

333
00:52:47,277 --> 00:52:50,576
If this ...
- A right?

334
00:52:55,285 --> 00:52:58,254
It's crazy!

335
00:53:22,312 --> 00:53:24,280
What is it?

336
00:53:25,648 --> 00:53:29,277
What ...?

337
00:53:30,987 --> 00:53:32,614
Let's go.

338
00:53:58,348 --> 00:54:01,017
I asked police to look for you everywhere.

339
00:54:01,052 --> 00:54:02,984
It was not necessary.

340
00:54:03,019 --> 00:54:06,022
The courage with which I took
here in front of you ...

341
00:54:06,057 --> 00:54:09,025
brought me here in the same way.

342
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:10,992
One minute ...!

343
00:54:11,027 --> 00:54:13,696
Where did you get those scratches?

344
00:54:13,731 --> 00:54:18,326
I'm from the thorns.

345
00:54:22,038 --> 00:54:24,336
What happened to you?
The Moti ...

346
00:54:24,707 --> 00:54:29,045
I happened to nothing
but what about the wounds on you?

347
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:32,014
Leave wounds,
how you burned your hand?

348
00:54:32,382 --> 00:54:36,684
It's just a hand, son.
But time to burn my whole body has arrived.

349
00:54:36,719 --> 00:54:40,348
Look Mom, never talked about this thing.
We bring the doctor immediately.

350
00:54:40,723 --> 00:54:43,692
Your father has gone to bring him.

351
00:54:44,060 --> 00:54:46,027
Jamun. Dr. Vine.

352
00:54:46,062 --> 00:54:50,733
At this age, her mother would be
nepoþii to play with.

353
00:54:50,768 --> 00:54:54,692
If more gate and you will burn the hand.

354
00:54:57,073 --> 00:55:01,042
In this case to employ a cook.

355
00:55:01,077 --> 00:55:05,081
In poor families, cooking
makes or mother or daughter.

356
00:55:05,116 --> 00:55:08,084
If you want, you can make a good daughter in the house.

357
00:55:08,119 --> 00:55:10,385
It's hard to finds you a good girl.

358
00:55:10,420 --> 00:55:13,423
A good girl falls from the sky
and either not coming to the palace.

359
00:55:13,458 --> 00:55:16,276
Look at your state ...
- It's not true.

360
00:55:16,311 --> 00:55:19,060
This Raju is not inferior to any king.

361
00:55:19,095 --> 00:55:24,100
Can not fall from heaven, but
if you want, I can bring to the palace.

362
00:55:24,135 --> 00:55:28,069
Do not talk of palaces son -
are only faþadã.

363
00:55:28,104 --> 00:55:31,107
Mr. Simon owes me 435 rupees
anna and 4 for the last few days.

364
00:55:31,142 --> 00:55:34,272
When I go to them I say take
that the master is away from the club.

365
00:55:34,307 --> 00:55:37,402
I decided to go to this club
money back to me.

366
00:55:44,454 --> 00:55:49,414
Moti, stay here. I'm back
After my money back.

367
00:55:51,127 --> 00:55:53,425
Why join?

368
00:55:53,796 --> 00:55:56,799
I'm going to take to Mr Simon
money bill.

369
00:55:56,834 --> 00:55:58,766
Do not see what is written there?

370
00:55:58,801 --> 00:56:01,283
If you do not know to read, I thi read it.

371
00:56:01,318 --> 00:56:03,765
Dogs and Indians not you in there.

372
00:56:04,207 --> 00:56:07,442
I want to cry about the fate lndiei ...

373
00:56:07,477 --> 00:56:11,106
where someone says a son
another son joined him and says ...

374
00:56:11,481 --> 00:56:14,817
"Dogs and Indians not allowed."

375
00:56:14,852 --> 00:56:18,154
You can cry all you want to go out.

376
00:56:18,189 --> 00:56:19,781
But you can not go inside.

377
00:57:01,864 --> 00:57:06,167
Oh you, Raju's father Tongawala!
- Yes, sir.

378
00:57:06,202 --> 00:57:09,539
Not yet you have awakened after drink
last night you came in?

379
00:57:09,574 --> 00:57:13,841
Sir, I do not drink.
You do not know to read?

380
00:57:13,876 --> 00:57:17,880
Yes I read. Do not burn the desire to enter -
I had to do this need.

381
00:57:17,915 --> 00:57:20,734
4 435 rupees and Anna are
payment of six weeks ago.

382
00:57:20,769 --> 00:57:23,162
I dull shoes
many trips to his office.

383
00:57:23,197 --> 00:57:25,555
Forgive me, sir. I will not leave
not until my money back.

384
00:57:25,590 --> 00:57:27,182
You talk too much ...

385
00:57:31,894 --> 00:57:36,566
Îþi you get the money. But after you
received in British hospitality.

386
00:57:36,601 --> 00:57:40,253
Drink. Yes, drink!
- No, sir. I'm not even touching it.

387
00:57:40,288 --> 00:57:43,906
Come on, drink.
- A As we said, do not drink liquor.

388
00:57:43,941 --> 00:57:46,875
It's very good.
- No, sir.

389
00:57:53,916 --> 00:57:55,884
I pour it into your mouth.

390
00:57:56,252 --> 00:57:58,588
Simon, tell you,
consequences will not be good.

391
00:57:58,623 --> 00:58:01,216
You'll see your own consequences.

392
00:58:22,945 --> 00:58:25,914
What is Moti?
What?

393
00:58:29,952 --> 00:58:31,920
Enough. Now allow it.

394
00:58:32,955 --> 00:58:36,584
Come here. Look.
What you want?

395
00:58:38,628 --> 00:58:41,597
This is your bill?

396
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:24,340
Simon. You've insulted enough.
Do not insult the money.

397
00:59:24,375 --> 00:59:27,308
We would consider as Goddess Lakshmi.

398
00:59:27,343 --> 00:59:31,973
Lakshmi is the name of my maid -
clean up our house.

399
00:59:33,015 --> 00:59:34,312
Dishes.

400
00:59:34,684 --> 00:59:36,651
Safely shoes.

401
00:59:36,686 --> 00:59:38,654
And it hit the shoe.

402
00:59:41,023 --> 00:59:44,343
Lakshmi 435
went down the drain.

403
00:59:44,378 --> 00:59:47,663
Look here for the remaining four anna coin.

404
00:59:48,698 --> 00:59:53,703
I rest -
but I have a stamp of King George 4 anna.

405
00:59:53,738 --> 00:59:58,663
On any sticks, arrive at the destination.

406
01:00:09,385 --> 01:00:12,019
Indians and dogs are not allowed and -

407
01:00:12,054 --> 01:00:15,683
Wherever you see a sign that
This may not dare to enter.

408
01:00:29,071 --> 01:00:32,370
These people have forced me to drink liquor.

409
01:00:38,414 --> 01:00:44,086
Dogs come as Indians
and has entered and horse.

410
01:00:44,121 --> 01:00:48,716
To throw them out,
May if you have a little dignity.

411
01:01:01,704 --> 01:01:04,673
I mean, anyone ...?

412
01:01:05,875 --> 01:01:08,844
You forced to drink liquor.

413
01:01:14,217 --> 01:01:17,518
It's bad taste like water.

414
01:01:17,553 --> 01:01:20,852
Îþi show you what's potent liquor Indian.

415
01:01:26,229 --> 01:01:31,234
If you drink it once,
will influence the whole life.

416
01:01:31,269 --> 01:01:33,534
I do not drink liquor Indian.

417
01:01:33,569 --> 01:01:37,198
Why? You can drink Indian blood -
but the Indian liquor?

418
01:01:47,583 --> 01:01:50,552
Continuation of the band,
I sing other's organs.

419
01:02:01,931 --> 01:02:06,561
Hey, and coward.
Where are you running?

420
01:02:08,604 --> 01:02:12,563
Get 435 rupees.

421
01:02:13,609 --> 01:02:18,614
Here. Deliver me from this dog.
Get everything.

422
01:02:18,649 --> 01:02:20,582
And a four-anna ticket.

423
01:02:27,290 --> 01:02:32,250
Moti Hai.
What I say to make him pieces?

424
01:02:37,300 --> 01:02:40,269
Hey Simon.
Where are you?

425
01:02:41,637 --> 01:02:46,976
Together with General Carr
Your 4-anna king drown.

426
01:02:47,011 --> 01:02:48,944
Jump to save them.

427
01:04:02,718 --> 01:04:05,016
Read up.
Read what you wrote.

428
01:04:33,082 --> 01:04:36,051
Leave them on the bag and i knew.
It is enough.

429
01:04:38,087 --> 01:04:40,385
I'll cruþa tongawala.

430
01:04:57,106 --> 01:05:00,109
I've saved them.
But there are people periculo and i. ..

431
01:05:00,144 --> 01:05:07,072
nobody knows where he lead the innocent.

432
01:05:10,786 --> 01:05:15,086
If something happened to you and I will die.

433
01:05:21,130 --> 01:05:25,134
Sorry for
Raju's behavior yesterday.

434
01:05:25,169 --> 01:05:29,303
I thoroughly rebuked.
It was wrong to rob you of and a.

435
01:05:29,338 --> 01:05:33,438
No matter. I do not kidnapped.
I went with him willingly.

436
01:05:34,143 --> 01:05:38,443
And just today, I came willingly.

437
01:05:39,815 --> 01:05:42,113
Today is my birthday, Mom.

438
01:05:42,485 --> 01:05:45,113
What are you doing dear?

439
01:05:46,155 --> 01:05:50,455
Thi-I felt my heart.
Let me touch your feet to tell you.

440
01:05:51,494 --> 01:05:57,500
Let your lives much, dear.
We only blessings for you.

441
01:05:57,535 --> 01:05:59,835
Only for this I came.

442
01:05:59,870 --> 01:06:02,133
Come each day.

443
01:06:03,172 --> 01:06:06,175
I invite you all to come to my birthday.

444
01:06:06,210 --> 01:06:08,142
You must Come tonight.

445
01:06:08,177 --> 01:06:11,812
What do we do? But if you want, and Raju ...

446
01:06:11,847 --> 01:06:16,018
I am not sure my program.
Depends on the state.

447
01:06:16,053 --> 01:06:20,189
There Raju. You must live.
Get it, it's your invitation.

448
01:06:20,224 --> 01:06:22,157
I came specifically to ask you.

449
01:06:23,192 --> 01:06:25,820
I'll wait.

450
01:06:32,535 --> 01:06:36,522
Have you seen the invitation?
It's for your birthday party mistress.

451
01:06:36,557 --> 01:06:40,509
Now you tell me? It takes someone
of the parties in the standby and the clothes?

452
01:06:41,544 --> 01:06:43,842
No.
Where?

453
01:06:47,216 --> 01:06:49,184
What's on your mind?

454
01:07:03,566 --> 01:07:05,864
Get a decent suit.
Quickly.

455
01:07:44,940 --> 01:07:48,569
It seems it's not in town.

456
01:07:51,614 --> 01:07:55,914
It's nice that you have not invited and the
Mr. Simon and Mr. Dyer.

457
01:07:56,619 --> 01:08:00,956
It's my birthday and I asked who I wanted.

458
01:08:00,991 --> 01:08:04,255
Who invited you?

459
01:09:18,367 --> 01:09:21,335
Goga! Who is that?

460
01:09:21,370 --> 01:09:25,374
Father can not be named -
aþa's father.

461
01:09:25,409 --> 01:09:28,343
And your dad is sitting next to you.

462
01:14:24,006 --> 01:14:25,639
At a party.

463
01:14:25,674 --> 01:14:28,643
You have to go to hospital.

464
01:14:29,011 --> 01:14:30,979
Do not you amestecaþi.

465
01:14:32,347 --> 01:14:34,645
I know what to do.

466
01:14:44,693 --> 01:14:46,991
Praise the Lord
child was not seriously injured.

467
01:14:48,030 --> 01:14:52,683
Rascal, elii wrong because your
my daughter could die.

468
01:14:52,718 --> 01:14:57,336
But I felt for tongawala
Rico and the bullet at the Chandelier

469
01:15:13,388 --> 01:15:18,060
Saving my daughter's life, that tongawala
became a hero in her eyes.

470
01:15:18,095 --> 01:15:24,066
And we can not arrest at
greatest villain ...

471
01:15:24,101 --> 01:15:27,035
because Mrs Elena.

472
01:15:27,402 --> 01:15:30,405
I heard that Ruby was hurt!
How is he?

473
01:15:30,440 --> 01:15:32,706
Saved.

474
01:15:32,741 --> 01:15:37,079
You can thank it's being saved,
but i can thank the man who saved her.

475
01:15:37,114 --> 01:15:41,379
The boy who saved her
deserves a reward, not your hate.

476
01:15:42,084 --> 01:15:45,383
Where's Ruby?
- In her room.

477
01:15:49,091 --> 01:15:52,726
Lady Helen is right.
Give them rewards and buy it.

478
01:15:52,761 --> 01:15:56,765
Then there will be the leader of slums.
It will be called a traitor.

479
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:59,063
This policy was and is ours.

480
01:16:03,438 --> 01:16:07,109
Goga. Tomorrow we get here on that
tongawala with respect.

481
01:16:07,144 --> 01:16:08,406
Very well, sir.

482
01:16:10,445 --> 01:16:13,448
Take these.
- Thanks, dear.

483
01:16:13,483 --> 01:16:16,416
These were the clothes of Mr. Lucky.

484
01:16:16,451 --> 01:16:21,081
What Lucky?
That proved to be very unlucky.

485
01:16:21,456 --> 01:16:24,084
He was wounded.

486
01:16:29,131 --> 01:16:32,430
Moti Hey!
What?

487
01:16:33,468 --> 01:16:37,427
Ruby is fine.
These are good news.

488
01:16:38,473 --> 01:16:42,442
Ruby is fine.
Drink and you.

489
01:16:42,477 --> 01:16:49,151
New. I drink HAS hishi. Come to
wedding of my daughter. Do you drink myself.

490
01:16:49,186 --> 01:16:54,783
Why to wait until then?
Get drunk today.

491
01:17:16,178 --> 01:17:21,161
Stops as soon as you see your horse here.

492
01:17:21,196 --> 01:17:26,144
Thi-I said, it's foreign, can not have.

493
01:17:29,524 --> 01:17:32,343
I ask to speak with him?

494
01:17:32,378 --> 01:17:35,163
Okay, I'll talk to him.

495
01:17:43,205 --> 01:17:46,173
Needless to minds.

496
01:17:46,208 --> 01:17:52,881
Thing is that Badal is in love with your horse.

497
01:17:52,916 --> 01:17:56,516
It's crazy.

498
01:17:56,551 --> 01:18:01,890
I showed the other mares 1000,
but he only wants it.

499
01:18:01,925 --> 01:18:03,857
It always stops here.

500
01:18:03,892 --> 01:18:09,196
Tell you that she marries,
no longer married or not.

501
01:18:09,231 --> 01:18:14,903
Listen, Mr. Curzon. Maybe
do not know, but your mare has grown up.

502
01:18:14,938 --> 01:18:19,863
Before you than is wrong,
should a mãritaþi.

503
01:18:21,910 --> 01:18:29,918
When your ancestors came to
visit this country, have objected? No.

504
01:18:29,953 --> 01:18:34,218
When they looked, took
country. I have objected? No.

505
01:18:34,589 --> 01:18:41,222
Despite atrocitãþilor,
people will argue. I have objected? No.

506
01:18:42,597 --> 01:18:46,556
Now I come to tell you peþim girl ...

507
01:18:47,602 --> 01:18:51,231
At least give us her.

508
01:18:53,275 --> 01:18:57,211
Do not see that we negotiate ...
do not mix!

509
01:19:01,283 --> 01:19:06,621
He is old and you prematurely.
He began to whiten.

510
01:19:06,656 --> 01:19:11,960
Think of me
if you're not thinking about him.

511
01:19:11,995 --> 01:19:14,929
Do not understand ...
