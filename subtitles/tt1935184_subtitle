00:02:01,988 --> 00:02:07,119
''Understand the gestures of eyes.''

8
00:02:27,547 --> 00:02:32,348
''The stars are at your feet.''

00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:36,980
''Every joy is here.''

10
00:02:39,859 --> 00:02:44,887
''The stars are at your feet.''

11
00:02:45,131 --> 00:02:49,761
''Every joy is here.''

12
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:52,833
''Every joy is here.''

13
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:57,103
''Express your feelings till
the night is young.''

14
00:03:00,146 --> 00:03:04,810
''Heed this heart..''

15
00:03:05,218 --> 00:03:10,417
''Understand the gestures of eyes.''

16
00:03:10,657 --> 00:03:14,525
''Shake, shake, shake.
Come, boom-boom.''

17
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:17,121
''Come, dance with me you all.''

18
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:19,928
''Everybody and all.''

19
00:03:30,643 --> 00:03:33,077
''There is no tomorrow.''

20
00:03:33,179 --> 00:03:35,545
''We both are young.''

21
00:03:35,648 --> 00:03:39,846
''There is love in the air.''

22
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,691
''There is no tomorrow.''

23
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:48,124
''We both are young.''

24
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:53,029
''There is love in the air.''

25
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:55,797
''There is love in the air.''

26
00:03:55,902 --> 00:04:00,839
''We've met this juncture
of youth.''

27
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:08,104
''Heed this heart..''

28
00:04:08,615 --> 00:04:13,575
''Understand the gestures of eyes.''

29
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:18,521
''This tender age is unrestrained.''

30
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:26,120
''Heed this heart..''

31
00:04:26,232 --> 00:04:31,067
''Understand the gestures of eyes.''

32
00:04:42,815 --> 00:04:45,841
Wow!
That was breathtaking, wasn't it?

33
00:04:46,152 --> 00:04:49,121
Now let's move to the next
stage of this evening.

34
00:04:49,822 --> 00:04:51,153

We're here to announce the best

l heard something..

44
00:05:29,095 --> 00:05:30,187
Well..

45
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:31,855
..he's my favourite..

46
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,564
..and the most talented.

47
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:35,534
Ajay Kapoor.

48
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,680
Congratulations. -Thank you.

49
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:56,446
Thank you so much.

50
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:05,219
Yes!

51
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:11,761
Oh no!

52
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:17,238
Oh God! l'm late.

53
00:06:23,616 --> 00:06:24,708
Oh no!

54
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:29,720
Enough, mom!

55
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,790
Why do kids hate food these days?

56
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:34,086
lt's notjust food..

57
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:36,328
..but they hate waking up
early in the morning too.

58
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:37,854
Now look at Ajay.

59
00:06:38,998 --> 00:06:39,987
He isn't here yet.

60
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,963
Such people are court-marshaled
in the army.

61
00:06:43,202 --> 00:06:45,329
Please, dad.
Not again. Not this morning.

62
00:06:45,938 --> 00:06:48,236
Child, he just need a chance..

63
00:06:48,674 --> 00:06:50,642
You start your army-stories.

64
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:52,142
l'm talking about Ajay.

65
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:53,801
His father was..

66
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:57,614
..an example for the army when
it came to discipline.

67
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,281
And he.. -Good morning.

68
00:06:59,385 --> 00:07:00,374
Good morning.

69
00:07:00,653 --> 00:07:01,642
Army stories again?

70
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:02,777
Yes. Want to hear?

71
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:04,948
No, aunt. l've important
meeting with a producer.

72
00:07:05,057 --> 00:07:07,321
l'm getting late.
-Have breakfast first.

73
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:08,783
Aunt..

74
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:11,787
l'll call you. Bye.

75
00:07:13,232 --> 00:07:15,097
Sir, the script is great.

76
00:07:15,701 --> 00:07:17,726
Each character is very lively.
-Good.

77
00:07:17,837 --> 00:07:19,828
And the entire look is up-market.

78
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:21,164
And the moments..

79
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:23,298
l've worked so hard..

80
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:26,378
When l give narration..
-No. l'll give narration.

81
00:07:27,146 --> 00:07:30,877
And then our hero comes
close to the heroine.

82
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:34,015
We'll play romantic music here.

83
00:07:35,087 --> 00:07:36,076
Leaves are flying.

84
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:38,151
Heroine is feeling shy.

85
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:40,783
Hero pulls heroine close to him.

86
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:44,095
Closer.. and closer.

87
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:47,926
And then our heroine
closes her eyes.

88
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:54,034
Their lips come in front
of one another, sir.

89
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:57,475
They both can feel each
other's breath.

90
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:00,370
Then suddenly the heroine's
brother comes in the middle.

91
00:08:02,181 --> 00:08:03,876
Why do brothers come
at the wrong time?

92
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:06,849
Can't the brother
enter a bit late?

93
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:08,045
We'll do it, sir.

94
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:09,777
But sir..

95
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:14,187
And in this scene..
the clothes should be drenched.

96
00:08:14,293 --> 00:08:17,262
Sir, all night l stayed
awake to write..

97
00:08:17,897 --> 00:08:19,922
..and thought of the same thing.

98
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,368
They both are in white clothes.

99
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:27,161
Mr. Mehta. -Yes?

100
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:30,275
When white clothes cling to body..

101
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,307
You wouldn't have thought of it.
-No, sir.

102
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:33,877
What a brilliant idea!

103
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:35,812
What a brilliant idea, sir!

104
00:08:35,915 --> 00:08:38,475
Mr. Mehta,
l'm not used to writing..

105
00:08:39,151 --> 00:08:41,244
..or else l can write
amazing scenes. Yes.

106
00:08:41,787 --> 00:08:44,312
And.. in the forest scene..

107
00:08:44,423 --> 00:08:46,516
..while running the
girl's clothes..

108
00:08:46,792 --> 00:08:48,453
..should get torn from places.

109
00:08:49,328 --> 00:08:50,818
How is it? -Wow!

110
00:08:51,797 --> 00:08:52,786
Wow!

111
00:08:53,065 --> 00:08:55,363
Sir, you've changed the flavor
of the entire scene.

112
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:58,731
You're so creative.
You're genius, sir. Genius!

113
00:08:58,971 --> 00:09:01,064
Ok.. we must start this movie.

114
00:09:01,574 --> 00:09:02,768
Sure, sir. Sure.

115
00:09:06,245 --> 00:09:07,234
Sir..

116
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:10,179
What was happening upstairs?
-What?

117
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:12,417
This kissing scene..
this waterfall..

118
00:09:13,152 --> 00:09:14,346
Sex element in every scene.

119
00:09:15,788 --> 00:09:17,085
lt sounds like a C-grade film.

120
00:09:18,324 --> 00:09:20,349
Sir, you're an award winning
director. -Yes.

121
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:22,121
You've won National Award.

122
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,197
So how can you make such films?

123
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:30,435
Ajay,
you're a greenhorn in this field.

124
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:35,563
l've 40 years experience
in this field.

125
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:38,901
You'll understand everything
slowly and slowly. Ok?

126
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:41,569
Sir, you've murdered my story.

127
00:09:42,181 --> 00:09:44,411
What did you say? Your story?

128
00:09:45,484 --> 00:09:47,315
ls this your story? Tell me..

129
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,088
..was there kissing scene
in your story?

130
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:51,979
No.

131
00:09:52,224 --> 00:09:53,953
Was there a waterfall
in your story?

132
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:55,516
No.

133
00:09:55,828 --> 00:09:57,090
So how can this be your story?

134
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:34,188
Hi, Ajay.

135
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:36,557
What happened?

136
00:10:39,905 --> 00:10:40,894
Nothing, Jia.

137
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:43,397
3 months..

138
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:46,410
l worked hard for 3 months.

139
00:10:49,281 --> 00:10:51,044
l toiled hard day and night
for this script.

140
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:54,951
Each and every line..

141
00:10:56,889 --> 00:10:58,948
l had put in so much effort,
Jia, in front of you.

142
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,087
l wanted my first
film to be a hit.

143
00:11:05,965 --> 00:11:07,091
But that scum Mehta..

144
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,558
He was acting in front
of the producer..

145
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:11,997
He blasted my script..

146
00:11:12,938 --> 00:11:14,371
..and l couldn't even do anything.

147
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:17,607
l'm so darn helpless! -Look..

148
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:20,603
..you can't give up like this,
Ajay.

149
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:22,675
You'll get another chance.

150
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:24,638
Have patience.

151
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:27,085
Someday you'll reach your goal.

152
00:11:49,141 --> 00:11:50,472
Yes. Come on.

153
00:11:55,981 --> 00:11:57,539
Hit it! Yes.

154
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,411
Use your hands! Come on.

155
00:12:00,186 --> 00:12:01,483
Today l'll make highest score.

156
00:12:09,695 --> 00:12:10,684
Jia.

157
00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:12,186
Hi.

158
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:17,729
What is the matter, Jia?

159
00:12:18,337 --> 00:12:19,326
You look upset.

160
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:21,435
Today is an important
moment of my life.

161
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,368
l wanted to share it with Ajay.

162
00:12:24,276 --> 00:12:26,073
But.. -Don't be upset.

163
00:12:26,345 --> 00:12:28,279
He must've forgotten.
-Well, l hope so.

164
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:31,072
Anyway,
it's time for my presentation.

165
00:12:31,784 --> 00:12:33,217
Hello, ladies and gentlemen.

166
00:12:37,223 --> 00:12:38,554
Could l've your attention please.

167
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:53,570
This software is so powerful..

168
00:12:54,206 --> 00:12:55,696
..that no virus can affect it.

169
00:12:56,242 --> 00:12:57,266
Nobody can hack it.

170
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:08,075
You're dead!

171
00:13:10,756 --> 00:13:12,621
Yes. l'm dead.

172
00:13:14,193 --> 00:13:15,592
How could l forget the meeting?

173
00:13:43,622 --> 00:13:45,214
Excuse me.
Where is conference room?

174
00:13:45,424 --> 00:13:46,550
That side. -Ok.

175
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:49,283
Astha.

176
00:13:49,528 --> 00:13:50,654
Come on. -Late again?

177
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:53,330
Sorry.
l forgot. -Let's go to my cabin.

178
00:13:53,432 --> 00:13:54,421
But..

179
00:13:57,236 --> 00:13:58,225
There she's.

180
00:14:03,475 --> 00:14:04,464
She's a genius.

181
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,057
2 years, gentlemen..

182
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:31,558
She looks angry.

183
00:14:35,774 --> 00:14:36,763
Congratulations.

184
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:39,174
lt was a sexy presentation,
l must say.

185
00:14:39,411 --> 00:14:40,776
Thank you. -Congratulations, Jia.

186
00:14:42,514 --> 00:14:43,776
l'm sorry, l couldn't make it.

187
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:46,213
But l'm sure you've
achieved your goal.

188
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,444
Jia, l'm very sorry.

189
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:51,612
Jia.

190
00:14:53,492 --> 00:14:55,824
Astha, are you coming to my
Software-Launch party?

191
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:57,885

192
00:14:58,464 --> 00:15:01,228
Let's go.
-Astha, talk to her. -Ok.

193
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:03,358
Astha, don't bring anyone else.

194
00:15:03,802 --> 00:15:04,791
lnvitees only.

195
00:15:05,704 --> 00:15:06,693
lnvitees only.

196
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:08,907
What the hell!
-Jia, l'm very sorry.

197
00:15:09,174 --> 00:15:11,301
You know when l write,
l lose track of time.

198
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:15,644
To save the heroine standing
on ship, if hero uses..

199
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,306
..helicopter instead of swimming..

200
00:15:17,816 --> 00:15:20,614
..will it suggest that he can
do anything to save his love?

201
00:15:21,553 --> 00:15:22,850
Jia, come on.

202
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:24,855
Go.. -l was lost in this theme.

203
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:26,782
Oh God!

204
00:15:27,192 --> 00:15:28,921
l lost track of time, Jia.
Come on.

205
00:15:29,895 --> 00:15:30,884
What happened?

206
00:15:31,397 --> 00:15:33,160
She doesn't seem to listen. -Go.

207
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:35,659
Bye. -Bye. -Jia.

208
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:36,757
Sit.

209
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:39,198
Oh, come on.

210
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:41,261
Jia, please.

211
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:45,475
Ok, done. You read the names
of shops on your side..

212
00:15:47,212 --> 00:15:49,180
..and l'll do the same on my side.

213
00:15:49,481 --> 00:15:52,143
This will improve our reading. Ok?

214
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:12,259
Jia.

215
00:16:14,239 --> 00:16:15,228
No..

216
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:26,715
He has written only four lines.

217
00:16:27,686 --> 00:16:28,675
Fraud!

218
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:32,450
This Ajay is too much!

219
00:16:33,258 --> 00:16:35,351
Don't vent Ajay's anger
on this mug?

220
00:16:46,038 --> 00:16:47,596
Don't be so angry, child.

221
00:16:47,706 --> 00:16:48,764
l'm not angry, mom.

222
00:16:49,441 --> 00:16:50,703
l'm just worried about him.

223
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:52,376
He has stopped writing.

224
00:16:52,911 --> 00:16:54,503
He's just obsessed
with his gaming.

225
00:16:54,646 --> 00:16:55,635
relax, child.

226
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:58,740
He should prepare next
concepts and ideas.

227
00:16:59,251 --> 00:17:00,411
One director cheated him..

228
00:17:00,819 --> 00:17:03,253
..it doesn't mean every
director will cheat.

229
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:04,915
Coffee is getting cold.

230
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:16,390
Jia.

231
00:17:19,438 --> 00:17:20,427
Look, child..

232
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:22,839
..l don't know what kind
of a writer Ajay is.

233
00:17:23,575 --> 00:17:24,564
But..

234
00:17:35,821 --> 00:17:37,311
..he's a very good human being.

235
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:39,382
l know.

236
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,391
Oh, Mr. Steve. -Sam.

237
00:17:43,662 --> 00:17:44,754
Welcome to the party.

238
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:46,019
Cheers.

239
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:48,355
Sir..

240
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,431
Want to have one -No, thanks.
-Ok, we'll share.

241
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:54,503
Yeah. -What are you doing?

242
00:17:54,873 --> 00:17:55,862
Which one is it?

243
00:17:55,974 --> 00:17:57,839
Scotch, of course.
What a question?

244
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:00,870
l mean how many glasses
did you drink.

245
00:18:01,046 --> 00:18:03,014
Army men don't count their drinks.

246
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:04,606
Uncle, having fun?

247
00:18:04,716 --> 00:18:07,583
What?
You're celebrating with milk?

248
00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:10,683
Uncle, this is fruit punch.
-But it's made with milk, right?

249
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,550
Be a man!

250
00:18:12,891 --> 00:18:13,880
Try scotch!

251
00:18:14,393 --> 00:18:15,826
Mr. Sam. -Hi.

252
00:18:16,528 --> 00:18:17,517

Ok.

257
00:18:26,738 --> 00:18:29,002
You'll be heading the department

258
00:18:29,808 --> 00:18:30,900
Thank you, sir. But..

259
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:34,745
As l told you earlier l'd prefer
to work in my own country.

260
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:36,639
Oh.. l totally understand.

261
00:18:36,748 --> 00:18:38,079
But consider it one more time.

262
00:18:38,584 --> 00:18:41,849
The door to my company is always
open to you, Miss Jia.

263
00:18:42,354 --> 00:18:44,413
Thank you, sir.

264
00:18:45,757 --> 00:18:46,849
Take care. -Thank you.

265
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,753
Bye. -Bye.

266
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:51,418
Are you mad?

267
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:54,558
l don't believe this.
You rejected this offer?

268
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,328
And.. what was that?

269
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,766
l'd prefer to work
in my own country.

270
00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:00,839
Oh my God. Jia!

271
00:19:01,373 --> 00:19:02,931
You don't get such chances
very often.

272
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:04,030
relax, Astha.

273
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:07,111
l don't want to leave
Ajay and my family.

274
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:09,672
You.. and Ajay..

275
00:19:11,783 --> 00:19:15,082
Oh.. l mean you're great
Typical lndian Women.

276
00:19:15,687 --> 00:19:16,915
You should've introduced me.

277
00:19:17,422 --> 00:19:18,582
My work would've bee done.

278
00:19:26,398 --> 00:19:27,888
Good morning, sir. -They've come.

279
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,025
Yes. They're waiting for
you in conference room.

280
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:33,004
Good morning. -Please be seated.

281
00:19:37,543 --> 00:19:38,703
Take a seat. -Thank you.

282
00:19:40,212 --> 00:19:42,737
Mr. Sharad,
what have you thought about it?

283
00:19:43,081 --> 00:19:44,070
About what?

284
00:19:44,216 --> 00:19:45,547
The builder's offer.

285
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:47,010
lt's a nice offer.

286
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:49,086
For the land of our trust..

287
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:51,182
..builder is ready to give
millions of rupees.

288
00:19:51,456 --> 00:19:53,856
He wants to make the biggest
Mall of Asia there.

289
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:55,426
Three trustees are against it.

290
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:57,023
But we three are ready.

291
00:19:57,563 --> 00:19:59,929
Now your vote will decide.

292
00:20:01,633 --> 00:20:03,533
Mr. Shah,
that land is children's park.

293
00:20:04,069 --> 00:20:06,867
And as a chairman, l don't want
to snatch children's right.

294
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:11,097
So not Mall but park
will be made there.

295
00:20:13,612 --> 00:20:15,512
Anything else.
-May l come in, sir?

296
00:20:17,015 --> 00:20:18,073
Yes, Seema.

00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:35,496
And 10 Lacs for Group Wedding.

301
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,603
And 25 Lacs for the trust..

302
00:20:40,706 --> 00:20:43,436
..that want to open hospital
in the village for the poor.

303
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:44,970
No.. they're fraud.

304
00:20:46,478 --> 00:20:48,070
They're not making hospital
for the poor..

305
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:51,644
..but nursing home to earn money.

306
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:54,480
You don't need to give
anything to them.

307
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:58,556
Ajay, when did you come?
-Just now.. -Sit.

308
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:05,620
This is the speech for your
Trust's annual meeting.

309
00:21:06,298 --> 00:21:07,458
Ah.. thank you.

310
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:17,098
Nice job! You're very talented.
-Thank you, sir.

311
00:21:17,209 --> 00:21:19,734
Did the work start on your film?
-No, sir.

312
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:22,544
Maybe it will never start.

313
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:27,009
Ajay, those who don't
fight get defeated.

314
00:21:28,687 --> 00:21:29,676
So keep fighting.

315
00:21:30,088 --> 00:21:31,885
One day,
the world will appreciate you.

316
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:34,748
Ok.

317
00:21:45,537 --> 00:21:47,061
Hello, sir.
-Jia, l've some work for you.

318
00:21:48,607 --> 00:21:50,507
Can you come to office
to make a website..

319
00:21:50,609 --> 00:21:52,008

320
00:21:52,277 --> 00:21:53,767
No problem, sir. l'll be there.

00:22:06,725 --> 00:22:08,920
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Constellation.

325
00:22:28,113 --> 00:22:30,809
Now CO Mr. Sharma of this museum..

326
00:22:31,316 --> 00:22:33,341
..will tell you about this
Constellation. Mr. Sharma.

327
00:22:33,785 --> 00:22:35,047
Thank you very much, sir.

328
00:22:36,154 --> 00:22:37,951
As Mr. Sharad told you..

329
00:22:39,124 --> 00:22:40,853
..this beautiful necklace..

330
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,125
..is called Constellation.

331
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:47,062
The most important thing about
this necklace is that..

332
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:53,300
..every diamond in it's flawless.

333
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:59,567
And that blue diamond..

334
00:23:01,346 --> 00:23:04,645
..was found in 1640..

335
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:06,679
..in Kolur mines of
Andhra Pradesh.

336
00:23:09,121 --> 00:23:11,146
lt's a diamond of
1 15 caret weight.

337
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:14,715
And till today such a diamond
was never found.

338
00:23:15,994 --> 00:23:18,827
The necklace studded
with it was made..

339
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:21,296
..for king of Gwalior for her the.

340
00:23:22,868 --> 00:23:25,132
At that time it's price..

341
00:23:26,204 --> 00:23:28,069
..was equal to 150
kilograms of gold.

342
00:23:28,673 --> 00:23:30,732
lt was stolen in British regime.

343
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:33,668
lt was stolen many
times after that.

344
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:36,973
lt was bought and sold
many times and today..

345
00:23:37,949 --> 00:23:39,746
..because of our archaeological
department..

346
00:23:39,985 --> 00:23:41,782
..Art and Culture department..

347
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:43,243
..it's with us.

348
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:47,384
And for the next 2 months,
it will be in this museum.

349
00:23:48,193 --> 00:23:49,182
After that..

350
00:23:49,294 --> 00:23:52,161
..it will be sent to different
states of the country..

351
00:23:52,964 --> 00:23:59,233
..for public exhibition of
our historical heritage..

352
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:01,705
..which will make us proud.

353
00:24:16,254 --> 00:24:17,243
Sorry, sir.

354
00:24:18,056 --> 00:24:21,287
This alarm is part of our
sound sensor system.

355
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,157
lt's used to security purpose.

356
00:24:25,063 --> 00:24:27,361
Whenever any voice or vibration..

357
00:24:27,999 --> 00:24:30,126
..crossed its decibel limit..

358
00:24:30,702 --> 00:24:32,329
..then the sound sensors
are activated.

359
00:24:33,104 --> 00:24:34,196
And alarm is set off.

360
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:37,434
Laser beam is on the next level.
lt's always on.

361
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:40,405
And believe me,
it can burn anything.

362
00:24:41,046 --> 00:24:44,482
And on the top level is
an invisible dome..

363
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:46,781
..which is bullet proof.

364
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:47,974
Bullet proof?

365
00:25:01,132 --> 00:25:03,032
You don't believe me? Look.

366
00:25:14,813 --> 00:25:16,280
This entire system
is computerized.

367
00:25:17,415 --> 00:25:18,780
Control room is in front.

368
00:25:19,451 --> 00:25:22,511
To deactivate this system,
there are two passwords.

369
00:25:23,421 --> 00:25:25,480
One is alphabetical and
other is numerical.

370
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:29,894
Both the passwords are
with our president.

371
00:25:30,128 --> 00:25:32,323
Wow! lnteresting!

372
00:25:33,231 --> 00:25:34,323

Turn left. Hit him!

378
00:25:49,347 --> 00:25:51,907
Hit him! Throw him down.

00:26:06,865 --> 00:26:08,765
Ajay. Mr. Sharad had phoned.

385
00:26:08,867 --> 00:26:10,266
A producer is looking

399
00:26:49,074 --> 00:26:50,405
Good joke, huh? -Yes, sir.

400
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:51,931
Sit.

As l'm a producer..

00:26:59,551 --> 00:27:01,951
..my story will be better, right?

405
00:27:04,155 --> 00:27:05,247
Good joke.

406
00:27:09,327 --> 00:27:10,316
Look..

407
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:15,088

408
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:18,165
Yes.
-Watch it twice very carefully.

409
00:27:19,204 --> 00:27:20,535
Translate it in Hindi.

410
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:22,295
And..

411
00:27:24,242 --> 00:27:25,231
..add some drama!

412
00:27:25,343 --> 00:27:27,174
But l've a better script, sir.

413
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:29,007
Keep it with you.

414
00:27:30,181 --> 00:27:31,443
lt'll be of use in future.

415
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:33,539
Watch this.

416
00:27:35,086 --> 00:27:37,418
Put situations for 4-5 songs.

417
00:27:38,623 --> 00:27:41,091

00:27:44,929 --> 00:27:46,863
The script will be ready!

420
00:27:47,899 --> 00:27:49,025
Good joke, sir.

421
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:52,966
But l can't do this work. -Why?

422
00:27:54,239 --> 00:27:56,434
Everyone does it. -They must be..

423
00:27:57,108 --> 00:28:00,202
..but this is theft.
-Son, you're very naive.

424
00:28:00,945 --> 00:28:04,676
This isn't theft. But inspiration.

425
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:06,439
lnspiration?

426
00:28:08,153 --> 00:28:10,644
Sir, because of people like you..

427
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:13,085
..we creative people
can't do anything.

428
00:28:13,391 --> 00:28:14,585
Good joke.

429
00:28:16,161 --> 00:28:17,185
Now l'm notjoking.

430
00:28:17,629 --> 00:28:18,618
You're a thief.

431
00:28:19,164 --> 00:28:21,655
Why don't you close this
production house..

432
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,694
..and open a grocery.

433
00:28:24,335 --> 00:28:26,895
Manipulate the weighting scale
and steal groceries too.

434
00:28:29,441 --> 00:28:31,375
What do you think of yourself?

435
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:33,272
ram! Jagan!

436
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:36,172
Do you think your Shakespeare?

437
00:28:36,614 --> 00:28:38,912
Throw him out!

438
00:28:39,017 --> 00:28:40,985
Leave me, l'm going.

439
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:49,549
God knows from where they
come to become writers!

440
00:28:50,128 --> 00:28:51,117
Yes.

441
00:28:51,362 --> 00:28:53,990
Ajay. When did you come? -Come on.

442
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:55,657
Why didn't you phone? -Yes.

443
00:28:56,267 --> 00:28:57,461
Ajay, how was the meeting?

444
00:28:58,603 --> 00:29:00,400
Ajay, l'm asking something.

445
00:29:00,505 --> 00:29:02,132
Just a second.
Let me crack the next level.

446
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,537
What happened with the producer?

447
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:06,006
He was a fool.
l refused his offer.

448
00:29:06,377 --> 00:29:07,366
Yes. -What?

449
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:09,504
He wanted me to copy
Hollywood film.

450
00:29:10,448 --> 00:29:11,710
Ajay, again..

451
00:29:11,983 --> 00:29:12,972
Jia.

452
00:29:13,184 --> 00:29:15,084
But Ajay.. -Stop nagging, Jia.

453
00:29:15,186 --> 00:29:16,278
Let me concentrate.

454
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:18,244
Yes.

455
00:29:19,657 --> 00:29:20,646
Yes.

456
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,751
Ajay, you and your stupid games!

457
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,489
Jia, this..

458
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:31,728
You shouldn't concentrate on
games but on your work.

459
00:29:32,003 --> 00:29:33,061
Jia, l'm doing that..

460
00:29:33,371 --> 00:29:35,236
l went to the studio to
meet producer. -Yes.

461
00:29:35,673 --> 00:29:37,402
But you refused to work for him.

462
00:29:37,709 --> 00:29:40,200
But Jia, l don't want to
do what he was asking.

463
00:29:40,678 --> 00:29:42,305
This isn't what l've
come here for.

464
00:29:42,413 --> 00:29:43,402
Oh really?

465
00:29:43,581 --> 00:29:44,707
What do you want to do?

466
00:29:45,383 --> 00:29:47,647
Come on. Something different.
Something unique!

467
00:29:47,752 --> 00:29:49,083
First do something normal.

468
00:29:49,254 --> 00:29:51,222
But how can it happen?
Do you know why?

469
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:54,252
Just because of these games.

470
00:29:59,364 --> 00:30:00,353
Jia.

471
00:30:03,501 --> 00:30:05,799
What are you doing?
-l should've done this long ago.

472
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:07,628
Jia.. -He exasperates me.

473
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:09,398
l'm fed up of him.

474
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:17,136
Jia.

475
00:30:48,146 --> 00:30:50,239
Ajay, two month..

476
00:30:51,249 --> 00:30:52,580
Do something in two months.

477
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:57,086
Or else l'll take the offer
of Australian company..

478
00:30:57,555 --> 00:30:58,852
..and go to Australia for ever.

479
00:31:03,394 --> 00:31:04,622
Your decision is wrong.

480
00:31:05,763 --> 00:31:07,321
l said what l had to.

481
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:09,765
Now you decide what
you want to do.

482
00:31:10,602 --> 00:31:11,796
Look, Jia.. -Ajay.

483
00:31:13,104 --> 00:31:14,799
remember! Two months.

484
00:31:16,341 --> 00:31:17,330
Only two months.

485
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:38,483
Munna, come here.

486
00:32:38,756 --> 00:32:40,781
Why didn't you come to
meet for so many days?

487
00:32:40,892 --> 00:32:42,189
How did you get hurt?

488
00:32:42,327 --> 00:32:43,589
Father hit me in anger.

489
00:32:44,228 --> 00:32:47,789
That day we forgot to go to market
while playing with you.

490
00:32:48,366 --> 00:32:51,699
l couldn't get anything and
everyone had to sleep hungry.

491
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:53,662
Take me to your father.

492
00:32:53,838 --> 00:32:56,807
No, brother. lf you come, father
will be more angry.

493
00:32:56,908 --> 00:32:57,932
He'll hit us more.

494
00:32:58,276 --> 00:32:59,265
Please go.

495
00:32:59,444 --> 00:33:01,241
We can't play everyday like you.

496
00:33:01,579 --> 00:33:04,446
We've to earn too to get food.

497
00:33:20,031 --> 00:33:21,658
Jia,
so much happened but you didn't..

498
00:33:21,766 --> 00:33:23,393
..feel the need to
tell me anything.

499
00:33:27,638 --> 00:33:28,627
Jeetu, pull over.

500
00:33:32,543 --> 00:33:33,635
Let's take Ajay along.

501
00:33:34,479 --> 00:33:35,468
No, sir.

502
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:37,276
There is less space.

503
00:33:38,249 --> 00:33:39,682
Ajay and l can't sit together.

504
00:33:40,985 --> 00:33:42,543
Do you know what you're saying?

505
00:33:43,988 --> 00:33:45,250
Very well.

506
00:33:50,495 --> 00:33:51,655
Time isn't with him.

507
00:33:52,997 --> 00:33:54,362
At least you support him.

508
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:56,663
Give him one more chance, Jia.

509
00:33:56,934 --> 00:33:57,992
l've given him that.

510
00:34:00,304 --> 00:34:01,293
We've to see..

511
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,803
..if Ajay can make
use of it or not.

512
00:34:07,912 --> 00:34:09,277
Ok.. let's go, Jeetu.

513
00:34:23,628 --> 00:34:25,391
Hello. Yes?

514
00:34:26,998 --> 00:34:27,987
Yes.

515
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:31,463
Oh sure. Just a moment.

516
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:33,659
Yes, tell me.

517
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:36,729
Yes.

518
00:34:38,009 --> 00:34:38,998
Ok.

519
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:42,703
Yes. Thank you.

520
00:34:43,014 --> 00:34:44,879
l'll surely tell him. Ok.

521
00:34:57,061 --> 00:34:58,085
What are you doing?

522
00:35:00,398 --> 00:35:01,422
l'm going, uncle.

523
00:35:03,835 --> 00:35:04,824
l've failed.

524
00:35:06,737 --> 00:35:07,829
Now l can't face Jia.

525
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:10,964
Son, army has one principle.

526
00:35:11,976 --> 00:35:14,467
We lose only when
he accept defeat.

527
00:35:15,546 --> 00:35:17,707
You fail only when you quit.

528
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:21,948
Take this.. they need a writer.

529
00:35:22,887 --> 00:35:23,911
Come on, take it.

530
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:25,847
All the best to you.

531
00:35:33,931 --> 00:35:35,023
Excuse me. -Yes, sir.

532
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:36,122
Which way to 302?

533
00:35:43,374 --> 00:35:45,001
Sir, take sweets.

534
00:35:46,077 --> 00:35:47,066
What for?

535
00:35:47,178 --> 00:35:50,739
Our sir has bought a
new flat in Juhu.

536
00:35:51,616 --> 00:35:53,106
Very good. -Yes, sir.

537
00:35:58,156 --> 00:35:59,953
Sir, you're called inside.

538
00:36:01,125 --> 00:36:02,387
How was that writer?

539
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:04,492
He was fine.

540
00:36:05,696 --> 00:36:07,926
Hello. Hi, l'm Ajay.

541
00:36:09,467 --> 00:36:10,559

00:36:24,215 --> 00:36:25,614
Very nice meeting you all.

Same here. -Yes?

550
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:29,452
Ajay, we all are friends.

551
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:31,749
We want to make a film.

552
00:36:32,823 --> 00:36:34,188
We've lots of money.

553
00:36:34,759 --> 00:36:36,727
But we need a very good script.

554
00:36:38,596 --> 00:36:40,996
We also have a very good subject.
-Ok.

555
00:36:41,098 --> 00:36:42,531
We tried a lot too.

556
00:36:43,801 --> 00:36:45,598
But.. it didn't work out.

557
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:48,095
We need a professional writer.

558
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:51,074
You know, the one who can
give it the right shape.

559
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:52,865
l understand.

560
00:36:54,478 --> 00:36:55,706
Can you do this work?

561
00:36:57,248 --> 00:36:58,408
Of course.

562
00:36:58,749 --> 00:36:59,738
l mean why not.

563
00:36:59,917 --> 00:37:01,475
What work have you
done before this?

564
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:05,180
Sir, l don't think it's important
to know what l did.

565
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:08,582
l think the important thing
is what l can do.

566
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:10,449
l like it.

567
00:37:12,163 --> 00:37:13,926
So you've to show what you can do.

568
00:37:14,832 --> 00:37:17,528
You've to make a very good
story on our subject.

569
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:19,635
How many days do you need?

570
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:22,638
8 days.

571
00:37:23,174 --> 00:37:24,163
Good.

572
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:28,211
When you bring the story,
you'll get the signing amount.

573
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:30,680
4 lacs for the entire movie.

574
00:37:31,148 --> 00:37:33,480
You'll get 50,000 at every stage.

575
00:37:33,985 --> 00:37:34,974
Perfect.

576
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:38,987
This is the concept of our film.

577
00:37:41,158 --> 00:37:42,182
Thank you, sir.

578
00:37:42,293 --> 00:37:43,726

Anybody for the championship?

584
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:02,143
Ajay is now busy with writing.

585

Well.. let's go for championship.

586
00:38:06,884 --> 00:38:07,908

Amazing plot!

590
00:39:28,232 --> 00:39:30,962
Sir, actually your story
was of bank robbery.

591
00:39:31,902 --> 00:39:33,665
But l've changed it a bit.

592
00:39:34,939 --> 00:39:37,237
Never mind that.
lnstead of bank robbery..

593
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:39,304
..heist in Jewelery museum..

594
00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:41,209
..will look better visually.

595
00:39:42,313 --> 00:39:43,302
right?

596
00:39:46,417 --> 00:39:49,784
Ajay, your writing has freshness.

597
00:39:50,421 --> 00:39:52,286
There is something. Good thoughts.

598
00:39:52,757 --> 00:39:53,917
Thank you. -You're good.

599
00:39:55,292 --> 00:39:56,281

600
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:57,819
Why waste time?

601
00:40:00,798 --> 00:40:02,766
Give him the money and
let the work progress.

602
00:40:02,867 --> 00:40:04,630
l want this script as
soon as possible.

603
00:40:05,803 --> 00:40:09,295
Ajay, how many days do you
need for a first draft?

604
00:40:10,875 --> 00:40:14,402
Nihal, l think screenplay will
be done in 12-15 days.

605
00:40:14,845 --> 00:40:16,073
l think that's okay with us.

606
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:18,882

607
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:21,312

a new caravan.''

625
00:44:15,085 --> 00:44:18,521

637
00:45:41,438 --> 00:45:42,427
What is this, Ajay?

638
00:45:42,773 --> 00:45:44,638
Do you remember two passwords
were required..

639
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:47,006
..to reach Constellation
in the museum? -Yes.

640
00:45:47,111 --> 00:45:49,136
Yes. One was alphabetical
and other numerical.

641
00:45:49,246 --> 00:45:50,235
right? -Correct.

642
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:53,740
l've found two such passwords
for my new scripts. -Tell me.

643
00:45:54,017 --> 00:45:57,544
You tell me,
what is Constellation in Hindi?

644
00:45:58,155 --> 00:45:59,713

645
00:46:00,290 --> 00:46:01,655

649
00:46:11,201 --> 00:46:12,190
Wow!

00:46:12,536 --> 00:46:13,525
l'll explain.

651
00:46:14,338 --> 00:46:17,501
As per Hindi mythology there
are 27 constellations.

652
00:46:23,046 --> 00:46:27,346
And these 27 constellations are
separated by 13.2 degrees.

653
00:46:35,325 --> 00:46:37,122
And this will be numerical code.

654
00:46:37,561 --> 00:46:40,223
Wow!
Alphabetical and numerical code.

655
00:46:40,497 --> 00:46:41,759
Yes. -That's amazing.

656
00:46:42,266 --> 00:46:44,996
Ajay, what was the need to spend..

657
00:46:45,102 --> 00:46:47,593
..so much energy to create code?

658
00:46:47,704 --> 00:46:50,138
l wanted to create
an authentic code.

659
00:46:50,841 --> 00:46:52,536
lf it had been a code of my game..

660
00:46:53,177 --> 00:46:55,737
What?
You're thinking of games again?

661
00:46:55,846 --> 00:46:58,246
Jia, l'm just trying to explain.

00:50:29,793 --> 00:50:32,421
And.. drive safely. Ok?

726
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:33,518
Yeah. -Bye.

727
00:50:42,839 --> 00:50:43,828
Your coffee, sir.

728
00:51:08,465 --> 00:51:11,764
Jia, our relation isn't because
of cookie, but our love.

729
00:51:12,803 --> 00:51:16,762
Then let's give a name
to this relationship.

730
00:51:17,774 --> 00:51:18,763
Meaning?

731
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:20,433
So let's get engaged.

732
00:52:31,515 --> 00:52:32,504
Ajay!

733
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:44,126
You stay here...

734
00:52:51,067 --> 00:52:52,159
Are you Ajay Kapoor?

735
00:52:58,041 --> 00:52:59,030
You?

736
00:52:59,142 --> 00:53:01,076
lnspector Gupte. Crime Branch.

737
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:03,001
ls it enough?

738
00:53:03,113 --> 00:53:05,411
Or do you want to see my lD card
and employment letter too?

739
00:53:05,515 --> 00:53:06,607
What is the matter, officer?

740
00:53:06,716 --> 00:53:09,446
l'll call you when l
want to talk to you.

741
00:53:10,453 --> 00:53:11,818
right now l want to talk to Ajay.

742
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:13,114
But what happened, sir?

743
00:53:14,925 --> 00:53:16,620
What were you doing in the museum?

744
00:53:17,727 --> 00:53:19,388
l was doing research
for my script.

745
00:53:19,896 --> 00:53:21,727
research for my script
or planning?

746
00:53:22,599 --> 00:53:23,588
What plan?

747
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:24,997
Constellation has been stolen!

748
00:53:31,174 --> 00:53:34,075
And we're sure that you're the
mastermind behind this plan.

749
00:53:35,545 --> 00:53:37,513
l came to arrest you.
Come with me.

750
00:53:37,847 --> 00:53:40,941
Just a minute, inspector.
You can't arrest him.

751
00:53:41,785 --> 00:53:42,945
l know some law too.

752
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:44,211
What proof do you've?

753
00:53:44,487 --> 00:53:47,820
Look, this is neither court
nor are you judge.

754
00:53:48,725 --> 00:53:51,489
Come to court for the evidence.
Ok?

755
00:53:52,162 --> 00:53:53,561
Come.. come.

756
00:53:53,830 --> 00:53:54,819
Officer.

757
00:53:54,931 --> 00:53:57,627
l was only researching.

758
00:53:57,734 --> 00:53:59,702
l didn't do anything.
l was only researching.

759
00:53:59,803 --> 00:54:01,668
Leave my hand.

760
00:54:02,005 --> 00:54:04,633
You can't take me like this.
Leave me.

761
00:54:08,144 --> 00:54:09,133
Hey.. -Come.

762
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:15,650
Yes, sir.
l'll be there. l'm on my way.

763
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:20,446
Take him carefully.
l'll meet the commissioner.

764
00:54:20,557 --> 00:54:21,546
Yes, sir.

765
00:55:27,090 --> 00:55:28,557
So what do you think, sir?

766
00:55:29,959 --> 00:55:32,519
Gupte, your investigation is
heading in the right direction.

767
00:55:32,629 --> 00:55:35,689
Thank you, sir. -Now we can
confidently face the media.

768
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:38,190
Kamble, send them in.

769
00:55:41,004 --> 00:55:43,063
We've information that
diamonds worth 100..

770
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:45,232
..Crore rupees were stolen
from the museum.

771
00:55:45,342 --> 00:55:47,139
Why is this news hidden
from media and public?

772
00:55:47,377 --> 00:55:48,537
Just a minute.

773
00:55:48,878 --> 00:55:49,936
One person at a time.

774
00:55:50,046 --> 00:55:52,105
Such ancient diamonds
were studded in it.

775
00:55:52,215 --> 00:55:53,682
lt was our country's heritage.

776
00:55:53,817 --> 00:55:55,546
Wasn't its security proper?

777
00:55:56,052 --> 00:55:58,043
lt's true that Constellation
has been stolen.

778
00:55:58,388 --> 00:56:01,323
But investigation is going on
so it's kept confidential.

779
00:56:01,591 --> 00:56:03,081
One who stole in spite
of high security..

780
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:06,629
..must be very intelligent.
-Please.. save yourjudgment.

781
00:56:07,597 --> 00:56:08,928
Don't turn this man into a hero.

782
00:56:09,232 --> 00:56:11,325
right now we only want to say..

783
00:56:12,035 --> 00:56:15,266
..mastermind has been nabbed and
investigation is going on.

784
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:16,361
Where is he?

785
00:56:29,419 --> 00:56:30,909
Please sit properly.

786
00:56:31,654 --> 00:56:33,918
Madan, he says please.

787
00:56:34,023 --> 00:56:35,684
lt seems he's new in this field.

788
00:58:39,516 --> 00:58:40,505
Yep.

789
00:58:45,421 --> 00:58:46,410
Oh no!

790
00:58:48,224 --> 00:58:50,192
Send security to the back side.
Ok?

791
00:58:51,461 --> 00:58:53,053
l think he won't be too far.

792
00:58:53,363 --> 00:58:54,352
Sir..

793
00:59:05,308 --> 00:59:06,502
All the corpses are sent.

794
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:08,336
But Ajay has fled.

795
00:59:09,412 --> 00:59:11,175
lt means Ajay isn't alone.

796
00:59:11,814 --> 00:59:12,940
He has accomplices too.

797
00:59:14,017 --> 00:59:16,110
We should've paid special
attention to his security.

798
00:59:18,121 --> 00:59:19,110
We'll see..

799
00:59:19,789 --> 00:59:21,256
Give his details to
all the informers.

800
00:59:22,358 --> 00:59:23,552
Keep an eye on his house.

801
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:26,828
Where can he go to escape?

802
01:00:40,603 --> 01:00:42,935
Don't cry anymore, child.

803
01:00:44,073 --> 01:00:46,564
Nothing will happen to Ajay.
He'll surely return.

804
01:00:47,944 --> 01:00:49,434
After all where could Ajay go?

805
01:00:50,913 --> 01:00:52,005
Police didn't find him.

806
01:00:53,449 --> 01:00:54,473
He didn't come home.

807
01:00:55,218 --> 01:00:57,152
He hasn't even contacted us.

808
01:00:59,088 --> 01:01:00,077
Did anything..

809
01:01:00,189 --> 01:01:01,178
No!

810
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:04,553
Nothing can happen to him.

811
01:01:06,596 --> 01:01:07,585
Nothing.

812
01:01:08,364 --> 01:01:09,888
May God protect him!

813
01:01:11,434 --> 01:01:14,096
But child, it's been 6 days.

814
01:01:14,971 --> 01:01:16,029
6 days.. 6 years.

815
01:01:17,373 --> 01:01:18,670
He has to return.

816
01:01:33,956 --> 01:01:35,617
Have faith in Jia's trust,
colonel.

817
01:01:37,293 --> 01:01:38,453
l'm sure Ajay will come.

818
01:01:38,661 --> 01:01:40,356
Mr. Sharad, l too want that..

819
01:01:40,963 --> 01:01:42,191
..he should return soon.

820
01:01:47,070 --> 01:01:48,059
Mr. Sharad.

821
01:01:49,338 --> 01:01:50,703
You've contacts at high places..

822
01:01:52,175 --> 01:01:53,164
..and sources.

823
01:01:54,744 --> 01:01:56,268
l'm sure you can find him.

824
01:01:57,246 --> 01:01:58,235
Look..

825
01:01:59,082 --> 01:02:02,245
..l too am as much worried
about Ajay as you're.

826
01:02:53,236 --> 01:02:54,396
You know what to do.

827
01:02:54,504 --> 01:02:55,493
Yes, sir.

828
01:03:36,112 --> 01:03:37,170
Keep lying down, son.

829
01:03:46,255 --> 01:03:47,381
l've done the dressing.

830
01:03:49,325 --> 01:03:50,758
By the way,
l'm veterinarian doctor.

831
01:03:51,194 --> 01:03:53,822
Don't worry.
l'll treat you properly.

832
01:03:55,364 --> 01:03:56,558
The wounds are very deep.

833
01:03:57,400 --> 01:03:58,560
They'll take time to heal.

834
01:03:59,836 --> 01:04:01,667
You've regained consciousness
after many days.

835
01:04:02,471 --> 01:04:03,802
Eat this biscuit and drink tea.

836
01:04:04,473 --> 01:04:05,462
And rest.

837
01:06:40,629 --> 01:06:41,618
Aunt, l..

838
01:06:42,031 --> 01:06:43,191
l know.

839
01:06:43,766 --> 01:06:44,824
You're leaving today.

840
01:06:45,468 --> 01:06:46,457
l've to go.

841
01:06:47,370 --> 01:06:49,201
Whatever you did for me
in these few days..

842
01:06:50,973 --> 01:06:52,372
Only a mother can do that.

843
01:06:54,543 --> 01:06:55,840
You gave me a new life.

844
01:06:58,881 --> 01:06:59,870
Keep it.

845
01:07:00,716 --> 01:07:01,705
No, aunt.

846
01:07:01,851 --> 01:07:02,840
All this..

847
01:07:02,952 --> 01:07:04,385
Money is only worth..

848
01:07:04,754 --> 01:07:06,381
..when it comes of use to someone.

849
01:07:06,689 --> 01:07:08,452
Or else they're only papers.

850
01:07:09,392 --> 01:07:10,381
Keep them.

851
01:07:13,429 --> 01:07:14,418
Bless you.

852
01:07:18,501 --> 01:07:20,469
Yes, sir. -What is in it?

853
01:07:20,569 --> 01:07:21,558
Parcel.

854
01:07:21,670 --> 01:07:23,638
l can see that. But what's in it?

855
01:07:23,939 --> 01:07:24,928
Koki.

856
01:07:25,041 --> 01:07:27,236
What's 'Koki'? -Check it.

857
01:07:27,343 --> 01:07:28,332
Hey, check it.

858
01:07:35,284 --> 01:07:36,273
Go now.

859
01:07:42,758 --> 01:07:43,884
This is for madam, Jia.

860
01:07:45,094 --> 01:07:46,254
Thank you.

861
01:08:59,435 --> 01:09:00,424
Hello.

862
01:09:00,970 --> 01:09:02,528
Where were you for so many days?

863
01:09:02,938 --> 01:09:03,927
Are you fine?

864
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:07,109
l'm fine, Jia.
-And you? -l'm fine, Ajay.

865
01:09:07,376 --> 01:09:08,536
We all were so worried.

866
01:09:09,778 --> 01:09:11,109
We'll meet and discuss that, Jia.

867
01:09:11,847 --> 01:09:13,144
Tell me about the police first.

868
01:09:13,582 --> 01:09:15,106
Police keep coming.

869
01:09:16,118 --> 01:09:17,517
Our phones are being tapped.

870
01:09:17,953 --> 01:09:19,420
We're been watched 24-7.

871
01:09:22,491 --> 01:09:23,480
Sir. Sir.

872
01:09:24,760 --> 01:09:26,159
A call came at Jia's cell phone.

873
01:09:26,428 --> 01:09:27,725
lt seems Ajay's on the line.

874
01:09:28,164 --> 01:09:29,461
He's near Mahim.

875
01:09:30,466 --> 01:09:31,455
Send the car.

876
01:09:55,791 --> 01:09:57,156
Follow that taxi.

877
01:10:46,642 --> 01:10:47,631
Ajay.

878
01:10:47,776 --> 01:10:48,902
Did anyone follow you?

879
01:10:50,946 --> 01:10:52,072
No, l don't think so.

880
01:10:53,215 --> 01:10:54,807
There was no news of you for days.

881
01:10:56,151 --> 01:10:57,140
Ajay, l was scared.

882
01:10:58,988 --> 01:11:01,252
l used to get such terrible
thoughts..

883
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:05,549
Now what, Ajay?

884
01:11:06,729 --> 01:11:07,923
What have you decided?

885
01:11:08,964 --> 01:11:10,454
Police think you're guilty.

886
01:11:12,268 --> 01:11:15,726
Since fled,
they're absolutely sure.

887
01:11:18,140 --> 01:11:19,835
l know l'll have to help myself.

888
01:11:22,778 --> 01:11:24,268
l'm sure those four
producers did it..

889
01:11:25,047 --> 01:11:26,537
..for whom l wrote the script.

890
01:11:27,950 --> 01:11:29,542
l always knew l was
passionate but..

891
01:11:30,152 --> 01:11:32,848
..l didn't know that because of
passion for my writing, l..

892
01:11:33,155 --> 01:11:34,520
..will crack the real code.

893
01:11:37,026 --> 01:11:38,687
Everything about them was fake.

894
01:11:39,061 --> 01:11:42,155
Their lD's,
names, address, everything.

895
01:11:43,632 --> 01:11:45,759
They used my intelligence
against me.

896
01:11:48,037 --> 01:11:49,504
They made such a clever plan.

897
01:12:02,051 --> 01:12:04,144
Those who help criminals
are criminals too.

898
01:12:06,121 --> 01:12:07,986
Why do you want to create
problems for yourself?

899
01:12:09,325 --> 01:12:11,725
Explain to Ajay to surrender.

900
01:12:13,295 --> 01:12:14,853
So that you can get him punished.

901
01:12:15,731 --> 01:12:17,130
Case solved. File closed.

902
01:12:20,002 --> 01:12:21,526
Look, Shinde! Patil.

903
01:12:21,770 --> 01:12:24,204
The people know how
Mumbai police work.

904
01:12:25,708 --> 01:12:27,107
You're perfectly right.

905
01:12:27,309 --> 01:12:28,936
Look, Ajay has been trapped.

906
01:12:29,912 --> 01:12:33,109
He just wanted his film
script to be perfect.

907
01:12:36,185 --> 01:12:37,812
His film script was perfect..

908
01:12:39,321 --> 01:12:41,050
..that's why Constellation
was stolen.

909
01:12:42,391 --> 01:12:45,155
Ajay must've taken entire
amount for his work.

910
01:12:45,828 --> 01:12:46,817
What?

911
01:12:47,162 --> 01:12:49,687
We heard you gave him
two months time.

912
01:12:50,232 --> 01:12:51,563
What else could he do?

913
01:12:52,234 --> 01:12:53,633
He did this in desperation.

914
01:12:54,837 --> 01:12:55,963
Love is such a thing!

915
01:12:56,372 --> 01:12:58,033
l understood your intention,
officer.

916
01:12:59,408 --> 01:13:00,773
But you can't do anything.

917
01:13:02,611 --> 01:13:03,737
He's too smart for you.

918
01:13:03,946 --> 01:13:04,935
We'll see.

919
01:13:06,248 --> 01:13:10,685
By the way, no criminal has
escaped Gupte till date.

920
01:13:13,088 --> 01:13:14,112
You can leave now.

921
01:14:12,314 --> 01:14:13,303
Come on.

922
01:14:13,749 --> 01:14:14,909
Come.

923
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:26,349
ls Ajay fine?

924
01:14:27,296 --> 01:14:28,285
Yes, sir.

925
01:14:28,931 --> 01:14:30,330
But he's very worried.

926
01:14:32,301 --> 01:14:33,825
Where is he? l want to meet him.

927
01:14:35,704 --> 01:14:36,966
l don't know where he'd be.

928
01:14:38,207 --> 01:14:40,903
To hide from police,
he keeps changing his location.

929
01:14:42,444 --> 01:14:45,845
And..
did you find those four producers?

930
01:14:46,815 --> 01:14:49,249
No, sir. All names and
addresses were wrong.

931
01:14:50,819 --> 01:14:52,719
Jia,
l think Ajay should surrender.

932
01:14:53,922 --> 01:14:56,049
He didn't do anything.
We'll hire a good lawyer..

933
01:14:57,025 --> 01:14:58,287
..and prove him innocent.

934
01:14:58,927 --> 01:14:59,916
No, sir.

935
01:15:00,929 --> 01:15:03,261
Until we don't get information
about those four..

936
01:15:04,333 --> 01:15:05,459
..Ajay won't surrender.

937
01:15:08,070 --> 01:15:10,504
Don't worry, Jia.
Everything will be fine.

938
01:15:12,908 --> 01:15:14,876
Tell Ajay if he needs my help..

939
01:15:16,044 --> 01:15:17,341
..he can phone me any time.

940
01:15:18,013 --> 01:15:19,241
Ok? Take care.

941
01:15:33,996 --> 01:15:35,463
Child, look at this.

942
01:15:37,332 --> 01:15:38,765
Which color is this?

943
01:15:39,268 --> 01:15:40,257
Yellow.

944
01:15:40,969 --> 01:15:42,960
Child, it's red. This is yellow.

945
01:15:43,405 --> 01:15:44,872
No, mom. lt's yellow.

946
01:15:45,207 --> 01:15:46,799
No, child. lt's red.

947
01:15:46,909 --> 01:15:48,399
No, mom. lt's yellow.

948
01:16:00,088 --> 01:16:01,988
No, child. lt's red. rED.

949
01:16:02,157 --> 01:16:05,251
The top you're wearing is yellow.
-This is red.

950
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:06,827
No, mom. lt's yellow.

951
01:16:07,229 --> 01:16:09,789
Do you've a license?

952
01:16:09,998 --> 01:16:11,090
l don't have license.

953
01:16:11,199 --> 01:16:12,427
Can't you see?

954
01:16:12,868 --> 01:16:14,495
You should've told me that
the signal was red.

955
01:16:15,103 --> 01:16:17,799
lt turned red in front of your
eyes but you didn't see.

956
01:16:18,073 --> 01:16:21,839
This is red.
-No, mom. lt's yellow.

957
01:16:21,944 --> 01:16:23,878
This is red and this is yellow.

958
01:16:23,979 --> 01:16:25,378
Jia, l think Neha is color blind.

959
01:16:26,148 --> 01:16:27,979
Try to hack rTO site anyhow.

960
01:16:28,283 --> 01:16:29,807
rTO site. Why?

961
01:16:30,385 --> 01:16:33,821
Because you've to find
out if any girl's..

962
01:16:34,356 --> 01:16:35,914
..license application
was rejected..

963
01:16:37,092 --> 01:16:38,787
..that too because of
color blindness.

964
01:16:39,394 --> 01:16:42,852
Because it's a rare case.
One in a million is color blind.

965
01:16:44,866 --> 01:16:45,855
Look, Jia..

966
01:16:47,102 --> 01:16:49,070
..it's very important
for us to find out.

967
01:17:13,328 --> 01:17:15,319
Ajay. Check your mail.

968
01:18:15,991 --> 01:18:17,151
Does Niharika live here?

969
01:18:17,492 --> 01:18:20,188
Yes, but madam went to club.

970
01:18:21,029 --> 01:18:22,018
Juhu club.

971
01:18:22,364 --> 01:18:24,992
No. ln Andheri.

972
01:18:25,233 --> 01:18:26,222
Who are you?

973
01:18:26,334 --> 01:18:28,063
Tell her that her writer
friend was here.

974
01:18:37,245 --> 01:18:38,234
Hello.

975
01:18:38,346 --> 01:18:39,404
Sir, Ajay speaking.

976
01:18:40,449 --> 01:18:41,973
l want to say something to you.

977
01:18:42,451 --> 01:18:44,442
Come to police station
and tell me.

978
01:18:44,686 --> 01:18:47,655
Sir, l'll come but with
proof of my innocence.

979
01:18:48,256 --> 01:18:49,348
Whom are you fooling?

980
01:18:50,358 --> 01:18:51,689
We know you're the real culprit?

981
01:18:52,494 --> 01:18:55,190
And it's in your interest to
surrender to the police.

982
01:18:55,297 --> 01:18:57,288
And tell us the name and address
of your accomplices.

983
01:18:57,399 --> 01:18:58,593
l've no accomplice.

984
01:18:59,468 --> 01:19:00,935
l'm not involved in this crime.

985
01:19:01,369 --> 01:19:03,064
real culprits are those
four producers.

986
01:19:03,505 --> 01:19:05,302
One of them will be found
in Andheri club now.

987
01:19:05,640 --> 01:19:06,629
Look, Ajay..

988
01:19:06,742 --> 01:19:07,674
Her name is Niharika.

989
01:19:07,743 --> 01:19:08,732
What?

990
01:19:09,444 --> 01:19:10,570
Hello! Hello?

991
01:19:59,795 --> 01:20:01,592
Hello. Yes, tell me.

992
01:20:03,165 --> 01:20:04,154
What?

993
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:06,526
Andheri club. Ok?

994
01:20:09,237 --> 01:20:11,705
Sir. There is information
from Andheri club.

995
01:20:12,207 --> 01:20:14,107
A girl named Niharika
was murdered.

996
01:20:16,044 --> 01:20:17,272
What was the name again?

997
01:20:17,379 --> 01:20:18,368
Niharika.

998
01:20:19,414 --> 01:20:21,211
l reached her with so difficulty.

999
01:20:23,819 --> 01:20:25,218
Now l don't know what to do.

1000
01:20:34,696 --> 01:20:35,685
Just think, Ajay.

1001
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:40,231
Some words.. some styles..

1002
01:20:41,169 --> 01:20:42,158
Some signs..

1003
01:20:43,538 --> 01:20:45,836
Ajay, there would be something..

1004
01:20:46,608 --> 01:20:48,132
..to find the path ahead.

1005
01:20:48,410 --> 01:20:49,672
l don't understand anything.

1006
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:55,207
ln fact, Jia, my brain
just doesn't work now.

1007
01:20:55,750 --> 01:20:56,774
Have patience, Ajay.

1008
01:20:58,520 --> 01:20:59,748
Everything will be fine.

1009
01:21:00,088 --> 01:21:03,182
How, Jia?
Will there be any miracle?

1010
01:21:05,393 --> 01:21:06,553
Nothing will happen.

1011
01:21:07,662 --> 01:21:08,788
You know something..

1012
01:21:09,764 --> 01:21:11,322
..my consequence will be that..

1013
01:21:12,167 --> 01:21:14,226
..l'll get punished for
the crime l didn't do.

1014
01:21:14,669 --> 01:21:15,658
lt won't happen.

1015
01:21:18,273 --> 01:21:20,764
Ajay, listen.
You go to Niharika's house.

1016
01:21:21,243 --> 01:21:22,301
And search there.

1017
01:21:22,744 --> 01:21:24,143
Maybe you can find a clue.

1018
01:22:19,668 --> 01:22:20,657
Sir, take sweets.

1019
01:22:20,869 --> 01:22:21,858
For what?

1020
01:22:22,237 --> 01:22:23,761
Our sir has bought a
new flat in Juhu.

1021
01:22:37,619 --> 01:22:38,608
Oh no!

1022
01:25:40,001 --> 01:25:40,990
Sir..

1023
01:25:41,102 --> 01:25:43,093
Get out.. -Hey, no!

1024
01:25:43,905 --> 01:25:44,894
Sir..

1025
01:25:45,540 --> 01:25:47,132
You fool.. -Stop!

1026
01:26:00,588 --> 01:26:02,021
Jia. Listen.

1027
01:26:09,130 --> 01:26:10,529
Tell me, what should l do?

1028
01:26:11,166 --> 01:26:12,155
Look, Jia..

1029
01:26:12,967 --> 01:26:15,094
..l met them first
on 10th October.

1030
01:26:16,204 --> 01:26:18,900
On the very same day he had
bought a flat in Juhu.

1031
01:26:20,108 --> 01:26:21,097
Now listen..

1032
01:26:21,776 --> 01:26:24,040
..hack the site of Stamp Duty.

1033
01:26:24,812 --> 01:26:26,404
But why Stamp Duty site?

1034
01:26:27,081 --> 01:26:29,015
Because they take photo
and fingerprints..

1035
01:26:29,117 --> 01:26:30,516
..of those who buy property.

1036
01:26:31,619 --> 01:26:35,077
Someone find out who bought flats
on 10th October in Juhu.

1037
01:27:03,151 --> 01:27:04,140
Vinay Shah.

1038
01:27:04,819 --> 01:27:06,116
Vineet Varma.

1039
01:27:11,125 --> 01:27:12,114
Hello.

1040
01:27:16,130 --> 01:27:17,461
Come on, guys. Let's go.

1041
01:28:23,564 --> 01:28:24,826
Get the ambulance. Come on.

1042
01:28:31,072 --> 01:28:32,266
l know Vinay got killed.

1043
01:28:33,675 --> 01:28:35,609
Jia, l don't why l feel that..

1044
01:28:36,077 --> 01:28:37,806
..there is someone besides
these four too..

1045
01:28:38,313 --> 01:28:40,281
..who doesn't want that police
should reach them.

1046
01:28:40,782 --> 01:28:41,771
Hey, get in.

1047
01:28:41,983 --> 01:28:43,280
But where are you taking me?

1048
01:28:59,667 --> 01:29:00,656
Who are you?

1049
01:29:00,768 --> 01:29:01,996
You don't recognize me?

1050
01:29:15,350 --> 01:29:17,284
You ask who l'm.

1051
01:29:21,923 --> 01:29:25,882
1 1 .. police of 1 1 precincts
are looking for me.

1052
01:29:27,195 --> 01:29:29,891
But nobody could nab me yet.

1053
01:29:32,767 --> 01:29:35,099
Hey.. come to the point.

1054
01:29:35,937 --> 01:29:37,234
Where is that container?

1055
01:29:37,772 --> 01:29:38,761
Which container?

1056
01:29:39,173 --> 01:29:41,073
Brother,
not container but Constellation.

1057
01:29:41,275 --> 01:29:42,299
Yes, that only..

1058
01:29:42,777 --> 01:29:43,766
Where is it?

1059
01:29:43,878 --> 01:29:45,812
l don't know anything
about Constellation.

1060
01:29:46,914 --> 01:29:48,142
l too was trapped.

1061
01:29:49,283 --> 01:29:50,307
l'm only a writer.

1062
01:29:51,252 --> 01:29:53,117
They made me write script
and then trapped me.

1063
01:29:53,955 --> 01:29:54,944
They used me.

1064
01:29:56,858 --> 01:29:58,621
l accept..

1065
01:29:59,394 --> 01:30:00,383
Forget container.

1066
01:30:02,063 --> 01:30:03,291
You write a script for me..

1067
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:07,595
..so that l can rob a big bank.

1068
01:30:07,935 --> 01:30:08,924
What?

1069
01:30:09,804 --> 01:30:12,068
You're very famous
in the underworld.

1070
01:30:14,909 --> 01:30:17,207
Sunny, take care of him.

1071
01:30:18,146 --> 01:30:19,135
He's very smart.

1072
01:30:20,181 --> 01:30:21,170
He's very sly.

1073
01:30:22,350 --> 01:30:23,339
Come.

1074
01:30:54,382 --> 01:30:55,371
Brother Sunny.

1075
01:30:56,284 --> 01:30:58,912
Nice bracelet!
Where did you get it made?

1076
01:31:00,121 --> 01:31:03,420
No, smarty. l got it from
Scorpion club. Got it?

1077
01:31:04,258 --> 01:31:06,954
VlP members get this for entry.

1078
01:31:07,995 --> 01:31:09,257
Big people come there?

1079
01:31:09,497 --> 01:31:11,226
Even people of film industry
come there.

1080
01:31:11,833 --> 01:31:14,028
Brother Sunny,
can l ask something?

1081
01:31:15,770 --> 01:31:17,328
What?
-Did anyone give you any chance?

1082
01:31:19,307 --> 01:31:21,138
You too look like a hero.

1083
01:31:21,909 --> 01:31:22,898
What a body!

1084
01:31:23,411 --> 01:31:24,844
These muscles..

1085
01:31:25,346 --> 01:31:27,940
..this face..
this height. Simply amazing!

1086
01:31:29,517 --> 01:31:32,486

What are you saying?

1089
01:31:37,758 --> 01:31:38,747
Yes.

1090
01:31:39,160 --> 01:31:42,288
l can get that role for you.

1091
01:31:43,464 --> 01:31:45,728
But you've to do a small
thing for me.

1092
01:31:46,100 --> 01:31:47,362
Tell me, what do l've to do?

1093
01:31:48,402 --> 01:31:50,495
Brother Sunny..

1094
01:31:51,272 --> 01:31:54,105
Help me get out of here. Please.

1095
01:31:54,909 --> 01:31:55,967
Want to hear a song?

1096
01:31:56,410 --> 01:31:57,399
Sure.

1097
01:32:04,452 --> 01:32:06,317
Do you hear the sound of anklets?

1098
01:32:07,221 --> 01:32:08,813
Do you think l'm a fool?

1099
01:32:15,263 --> 01:32:16,890
Smarty! Stay here.

1100
01:32:17,331 --> 01:32:19,492
l'll go and relieve myself.
Got it?

1101
01:32:26,340 --> 01:32:27,432
Brother Ajay!

1102
01:32:39,887 --> 01:32:40,876
Come fast.

1103
01:32:41,422 --> 01:32:43,754
We saw those goons bring you here.

1104
01:32:44,158 --> 01:32:46,023
Never mind. Untie me fast.

1105
01:32:47,428 --> 01:32:48,417
Careful.

1106
01:32:52,900 --> 01:32:54,231
Careful. Come on.

1107
01:32:55,503 --> 01:32:56,492
Come fast.

1108
01:33:00,441 --> 01:33:01,430
From here..

1109
01:33:09,050 --> 01:33:10,381
Ajay, where were you?

1110
01:33:10,484 --> 01:33:11,473
Jia, l'm fine.

1111
01:33:12,353 --> 01:33:14,514
Tonight in Scorpion club.

1112
01:33:15,323 --> 01:33:17,314
Tell Gupte one of the producer
can come there.

1113
01:33:17,425 --> 01:33:19,893
lf he comes, l'll gesture to him.

1114
01:33:20,161 --> 01:33:26,589
''Embers fly! Sparks fly!''

1115
01:33:28,169 --> 01:33:33,436
''lt spreads fire of love.''

1116
01:33:44,085 --> 01:33:48,818
''When love is kindled,
heart beats fast.''

1117
01:33:52,994 --> 01:33:57,454
''When love is kindled,
heart beats fast.''

1118
01:33:57,565 --> 01:33:59,931
''Passions run high.''

1119
01:34:00,234 --> 01:34:06,070
''The heart pines for love.''

1120
01:34:06,340 --> 01:34:10,538
''The heart pines for love.''

1121
01:34:15,182 --> 01:34:19,881
''When love is kindled,
heart beats fast.''

1122
01:34:19,987 --> 01:34:22,012
''Passions run high.''

1123
01:34:22,356 --> 01:34:28,420
''The heart pines for love.''

1124
01:34:28,529 --> 01:34:32,932
''The heart pines for love.''

1125
01:34:55,489 --> 01:34:59,550
''A beloved came in my life.''

1126
01:35:00,061 --> 01:35:03,360
''He cast a spell on me.''

1127
01:35:04,465 --> 01:35:08,902
''l restrained myself till
this tender age.''

1128
01:35:09,003 --> 01:35:12,302
''But now l'm in his control.''

1129
01:35:13,040 --> 01:35:17,033
''O' Lord! What can l do now?''

1130
01:35:17,144 --> 01:35:21,604
''When eyes are locked,
slumber is lost.''

1131
01:35:21,982 --> 01:35:24,314
''Lover rules the mind.''

1132
01:35:24,418 --> 01:35:30,379
''The heart pines for love.''

1133
01:35:30,491 --> 01:35:35,190
''The heart pines for love.''

1134
01:36:01,722 --> 01:36:09,219
''l eloped with my beloved.''

1135
01:36:10,564 --> 01:36:15,058
''l wanted to save myself
from the world.''

1136
01:36:15,336 --> 01:36:18,703
''But my heart didn't
listen to me.''

1137
01:36:19,673 --> 01:36:23,473
''O God!
What do l do as l'm trapped.''

1138
01:36:23,577 --> 01:36:28,310
''When youth comes to
blossom beauty..''

1139
01:36:28,415 --> 01:36:30,576
''..the heart goes crazy.''

1140
01:36:30,684 --> 01:36:36,748
''The heart pines for love.''

1141
01:36:37,024 --> 01:36:41,586
''The heart pines for love.''

1142
01:36:45,633 --> 01:36:50,468
''When love is kindled,
heart beats fast.''

1143
01:36:50,571 --> 01:36:52,596
''Passions run high.''

1144
01:36:52,706 --> 01:36:59,111
''The heart pines for love.''

1145
01:36:59,213 --> 01:37:03,377
''The heart pines for love.''

1146
01:37:03,517 --> 01:37:07,783
''The heart pines for love.''

1147
01:37:08,055 --> 01:37:12,287
''The heart pines for love.''

1148
01:37:12,393 --> 01:37:16,727
''The heart pines for love.''

1149
01:37:16,831 --> 01:37:21,530
''The heart pines for love.''

1150
01:37:59,106 --> 01:38:00,266
Leave that and follow him.

1151
01:38:50,724 --> 01:38:52,692
This case isn't as simple
as we thought.

1152
01:38:53,694 --> 01:38:54,888
Why do you feel so, sir?

1153
01:38:56,230 --> 01:38:58,528
l can understand that the plan
was made for greed of money.

1154
01:38:59,533 --> 01:39:02,525
But he doesn't seem to be capable
of so many murders.

1155
01:39:02,970 --> 01:39:04,631
And murders of those
people after..

1156
01:39:04,738 --> 01:39:06,296
..which he'll get trapped more.

1157
01:39:07,775 --> 01:39:09,675
Someone else is behind them.

1158
01:39:09,910 --> 01:39:10,899
lt's a big game.

1159
01:39:38,706 --> 01:39:39,536
Alright.

1160
01:39:41,642 --> 01:39:42,904
l think so.

1161
01:39:43,010 --> 01:39:44,238
Only one is left now.

1162
01:39:45,612 --> 01:39:46,601
Nihal.

1163
01:39:48,349 --> 01:39:49,611
Nihal was very quiet.

1164
01:39:52,920 --> 01:39:54,820
l think l heard him
speak just once.

1165
01:39:56,023 --> 01:39:57,183
Just once.

1166
01:39:58,959 --> 01:40:00,620
Maybe he was talking
to his girl friend.

1167
01:40:03,797 --> 01:40:04,855
lt was very strange.

1168
01:40:06,867 --> 01:40:07,856
What was it?

1169
01:40:07,968 --> 01:40:09,435
Don't forget tonight's party.

1170
01:40:11,372 --> 01:40:13,567
No, babes.
You're forgetting something.

1171
01:40:14,975 --> 01:40:15,964
l remember.

1172
01:40:17,277 --> 01:40:19,711
A kiss on the bed.
-A kiss on the toe.

1173
01:40:22,016 --> 01:40:23,005
A kiss on the bed.

1174
01:40:24,385 --> 01:40:25,409
A kiss on the toe.

1175
01:40:26,787 --> 01:40:27,811
What does this mean?

1176
01:40:30,524 --> 01:40:31,786
Seems to be incomplete lines.

1177
01:40:31,892 --> 01:40:33,883
Maybe his girl friend used
to complete these lines.

1178
01:40:34,895 --> 01:40:36,863
Anyway, with this..

1179
01:40:37,765 --> 01:40:38,754
Oh no!

1180
01:40:38,866 --> 01:40:39,958
Let's get out of here.

1181
01:40:58,685 --> 01:40:59,674
Hello, child.

1182
01:40:59,787 --> 01:41:02,278
Hi, aunt.
Hi, uncle. -Jia is there.

1183
01:41:02,423 --> 01:41:03,412
Ok.

1184
01:41:04,091 --> 01:41:05,251
Jia.

1185
01:41:10,731 --> 01:41:11,789
How was your holiday?

1186
01:41:12,032 --> 01:41:13,021
Great.

1187
01:41:13,667 --> 01:41:14,656
Guess what?

1188
01:41:16,303 --> 01:41:17,463
l'm getting engaged.

1189
01:41:17,938 --> 01:41:18,996
Oh really? -Yeah

1190
01:41:20,407 --> 01:41:21,567
So who is the lucky guy?

1191
01:41:21,809 --> 01:41:22,798
Alex!

1192
01:41:23,110 --> 01:41:24,338
He's so mysterious.

1193
01:41:24,812 --> 01:41:27,576
l mean..
he's my Mr. right. l'm so sure.

1194
01:41:29,316 --> 01:41:30,305
Excuse me.

1195
01:41:33,654 --> 01:41:35,019
Hi. Oh..

1196
01:41:36,423 --> 01:41:37,856
Yeah.
l'll be there in ten minutes.

1197
01:41:41,595 --> 01:41:42,755
l'm feeling shy.

1198
01:41:44,565 --> 01:41:45,554
l'll fly.

1199
01:41:49,770 --> 01:41:50,759
Alex.

1200
01:41:52,005 --> 01:41:53,632
What was that you
just said to him?

1201
01:41:53,907 --> 01:41:54,896
That..

1202
01:41:55,542 --> 01:41:56,531
lt's a poem.

1203
01:41:57,544 --> 01:41:59,774
Alex says the first line..

1204
01:42:00,714 --> 01:42:02,739
..and l complete the second line.

1205
01:42:05,152 --> 01:42:06,380
A kiss on the bed..

1206
01:42:08,055 --> 01:42:09,113
..l feel shy..

1207
01:42:12,559 --> 01:42:13,617
A kiss on the toe..

1208
01:42:14,495 --> 01:42:15,484
..l'll fly.

1209
01:42:18,765 --> 01:42:20,995
We both have written it.

1210
01:42:21,969 --> 01:42:23,027
l know it's stupid.

1211
01:42:23,971 --> 01:42:24,960
But we've fun.

1212
01:42:26,874 --> 01:42:28,000
When is the engagement?

1213
01:42:28,709 --> 01:42:29,698
Next month.

1214
01:42:30,377 --> 01:42:31,708
Oh. l've to show you this.

1215
01:42:32,980 --> 01:42:33,969
Look..

1216
01:42:43,557 --> 01:42:44,546
Oh no.

1217
01:42:46,426 --> 01:42:48,053
Jia, this is Nihal.

1218
01:42:53,133 --> 01:42:54,657
Alex. Nihal.

1219
01:42:57,905 --> 01:42:58,894
What now, Ajay?

1220
01:43:37,244 --> 01:43:38,404
Thank you.

1221
01:44:33,634 --> 01:44:34,623
Hey, get up.

1222
01:44:37,771 --> 01:44:39,739
Sir, we found this witness.

1223
01:44:40,574 --> 01:44:41,734
Sir, my name is Vinayak.

1224
01:44:42,175 --> 01:44:43,233
l saw that man..

1225
01:44:43,677 --> 01:44:45,542
..who shot that boy
outside the court.

1226
01:44:47,214 --> 01:44:48,704
Can you recognize his face?

1227
01:44:48,815 --> 01:44:49,804
Yes, sir.

1228
01:44:50,284 --> 01:44:51,512
Will you testify?

1229
01:44:51,618 --> 01:44:52,607
Yes.

1230
01:45:36,630 --> 01:45:37,619
Explain this.

1231
01:45:38,832 --> 01:45:40,663
Doesn't police have
better work than..

1232
01:45:40,767 --> 01:45:42,132
..to malign respected people?

1233
01:45:48,041 --> 01:45:49,030
respected?

1234
01:45:50,844 --> 01:45:51,833
Just a minute.

1235
01:45:54,881 --> 01:45:56,974
l've all the information.
Get the report.

1236
01:45:57,084 --> 01:45:58,073
Ok, sir.

1237
01:45:58,585 --> 01:45:59,643
Mr. Sharad.

1238
01:46:01,955 --> 01:46:04,924
Many respected people in
the world do big deeds..

1239
01:46:05,992 --> 01:46:11,020
..but they're respected only till
we find proof against them.

1240
01:46:11,164 --> 01:46:12,597
What's the proof against me?

1241
01:46:12,699 --> 01:46:16,135
An eye witness saw you shot Ajay.

1242
01:46:16,737 --> 01:46:18,830
lt's rubbish!
Where is that witness?

1243
01:46:18,939 --> 01:46:20,634
You can meet him in the court.

1244
01:46:20,741 --> 01:46:23,005
Ok.. can you take me to court?

1245
01:46:23,810 --> 01:46:27,075
l plan to take you to jail.

1246
01:46:27,914 --> 01:46:28,903
Then arrest me.

1247
01:46:30,884 --> 01:46:34,251
Not now..
but don't leave the city.

1248
01:46:35,188 --> 01:46:36,587
Tell your guards..

1249
01:46:37,324 --> 01:46:40,157
..to open the door for me when
l come to your house.

1250
01:46:41,828 --> 01:46:43,591
And.. it's a police's job.

1251
01:46:44,030 --> 01:46:46,225
We work even at night. Ok?

1252
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:48,058
l like his plan.

1253
01:46:49,169 --> 01:46:52,161
Time will decide who
punishes whom.

1254
01:46:55,809 --> 01:46:56,798
Mr. Sharad.

1255
01:46:57,978 --> 01:47:00,776
After all you got trapped
in Ajay and my plan.

1256
01:47:15,996 --> 01:47:19,693
Alex! l told you not to come here.

1257
01:47:21,668 --> 01:47:22,726
Why are you here?

1258
01:47:24,771 --> 01:47:25,795
Why are you here?

1259
01:47:26,840 --> 01:47:30,936
Sir, that.. l want to talk to you
about something important.

1260
01:47:31,144 --> 01:47:32,133
What is it?

1261
01:47:33,113 --> 01:47:34,102
Sir, your..

1262
01:47:34,981 --> 01:47:36,778
Your photo is published
in every newspaper.

1263
01:47:36,883 --> 01:47:38,851
No everything published in
newspaper is true, Alex.

1264
01:47:39,820 --> 01:47:41,447
l know it's Gupte's ruse.

1265
01:47:41,721 --> 01:47:45,020
You mean to say..
you didn't shoot at Ajay.

1266
01:47:45,292 --> 01:47:47,817
l've many men to shoot Ajay.

1267
01:47:48,328 --> 01:47:49,920
The way your 3 friends
got killed..

1268
01:47:50,030 --> 01:47:51,395
..Ajay too would've been killed.

1269
01:47:52,866 --> 01:47:54,731
l want Ajay to stay alive
so that he can..

1270
01:47:54,835 --> 01:47:56,462
..be accused of stealing
Constellation.

1271
01:47:57,437 --> 01:47:59,428
But l think Ajay has joined Gupte.

1272
01:48:00,240 --> 01:48:02,708
Just for your information,
when bullet was fired at Ajay..

1273
01:48:03,276 --> 01:48:06,404
..l was fishing on my yacht.
They can't prove a thing.

1274
01:48:06,947 --> 01:48:08,972
Thank God, sir. l got scared.

1275
01:48:10,517 --> 01:48:13,975
Sir, l've a contact who wants
to buy Constellation.

1276
01:48:14,254 --> 01:48:15,983
l don't need your contact.

1277
01:48:16,323 --> 01:48:18,018
Your work is over. You can go.

1278
01:48:18,124 --> 01:48:19,022
But sir,
l was talking of your profit..

1279
01:48:19,125 --> 01:48:20,786
To think about my profit..

1280
01:48:24,764 --> 01:48:25,753
Who are they?

1281
01:48:26,166 --> 01:48:28,999
Sir, they're Nrl's from USA.

1282
01:48:29,803 --> 01:48:30,792
Good.

1283
01:48:32,272 --> 01:48:33,261
Sit.

1284
01:48:33,373 --> 01:48:35,102
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

1285
01:48:36,376 --> 01:48:38,276
Nrl. -USA.

1286
01:48:38,378 --> 01:48:39,367
From USA.

1287
01:49:00,200 --> 01:49:02,896
Alex, wait here.
l want to show you something.

1288
01:49:05,338 --> 01:49:07,238
Gupte must've recorded
my confession.

1289
01:49:07,340 --> 01:49:08,898
Let's get out of this place.

1290
01:49:27,827 --> 01:49:29,192
l think there is some problem.

1291
01:49:29,496 --> 01:49:30,758
l'll check inside.

1292
01:49:31,264 --> 01:49:32,322
Sir, l'll come too.

1293
01:49:32,866 --> 01:49:34,834
No, you wait here. Listen..

1294
01:49:36,002 --> 01:49:37,560
Keep this gun.
Use it if you've to.

1295
01:49:38,271 --> 01:49:39,260
Ok, sir.

1296
01:50:27,354 --> 01:50:28,981
Shinde. -Yes, sir.

1297
01:50:29,089 --> 01:50:31,614
Seal the roads to airport.

1298
01:50:31,891 --> 01:50:33,483
Sharad will try to leave the city.

1299
01:50:34,394 --> 01:50:35,622
We can not let him escape.

1300
01:50:56,916 --> 01:50:58,247
Oh.. stop.

1301
01:51:00,553 --> 01:51:02,316
l had made such a nice plan.

1302
01:51:03,456 --> 01:51:07,552
Four producers.
Film's script. robbery story.

1303
01:51:08,628 --> 01:51:11,324
And Constellation would
be in my hand.

1304
01:51:12,265 --> 01:51:13,926
And nobody would even doubt me.

1305
01:51:14,167 --> 01:51:15,327
Why did you do all this?

1306
01:51:17,537 --> 01:51:18,526
Constellation.

1307
01:51:19,973 --> 01:51:23,340
Only a fool will leave a
beautiful thing like Constellation.

1308
01:51:25,712 --> 01:51:26,872
Ajay.

1309
01:51:29,449 --> 01:51:32,282
Sir, you've always helped me.

1310
01:51:33,553 --> 01:51:35,111
You've always supported
both of us.

1311
01:51:36,022 --> 01:51:38,354
Then today.. why did you get me
trapped in such a big crime?

1312
01:51:40,060 --> 01:51:41,891
Sir, please. Don't kill him.

1313
01:51:42,295 --> 01:51:43,284
Leave him.

1314
01:51:44,564 --> 01:51:47,089
We had many people to break
the security system.

1315
01:51:48,334 --> 01:51:51,303
But..
we needed him to crack the code.

1316
01:51:52,238 --> 01:51:56,402
Now he was gathering proofs
against me with Gupte.

1317
01:51:56,743 --> 01:51:59,712
He was trying to get me arrested.

1318
01:51:59,979 --> 01:52:00,968
So that's not fair.

1319
01:52:01,247 --> 01:52:04,478
For that l've to kill him.
Gun please.

1320
01:52:05,351 --> 01:52:06,375
ln that case..

1321
01:52:06,586 --> 01:52:08,486
Sir, please. Sir..

1322
01:52:08,655 --> 01:52:09,519
l am sorry.

1323
01:52:12,492 --> 01:52:15,188
No, no, no.
l won't kill him so easily.

1324
01:52:15,695 --> 01:52:16,684
Just see now.

1325
01:52:17,097 --> 01:52:18,462
You wanted to play games with me.

1326
01:52:19,566 --> 01:52:20,692
Then let's play a game.

1327
01:52:21,401 --> 01:52:22,390
Bell.

1328
01:52:40,186 --> 01:52:41,676
Now will activate the
bomb tied to Jia..

1329
01:52:41,788 --> 01:52:43,449
..which will be activated
in 10 minutes.

1330
01:52:44,491 --> 01:52:46,083
There is a code to
diffuse the bomb.

1331
01:52:46,192 --> 01:52:47,659
And l know you're champions
of codes.

1332
01:52:47,761 --> 01:52:50,457
For that you've to
reach that bomb.

1333
01:52:51,364 --> 01:52:52,991
But before that my
men will kill you.

1334
01:52:53,266 --> 01:52:56,133
But still try your luck.
Save your love.

1335
01:53:07,680 --> 01:53:08,669
Good luck.

1336
01:53:33,072 --> 01:53:34,061
Ajay.

1337
01:54:10,076 --> 01:54:12,237
Ajay, please. Stop.

1338
01:54:14,881 --> 01:54:16,610
Ajay, stop.
Stay away from the bomb.

1339
01:54:16,716 --> 01:54:18,115
l'll phone the bomb squad.

1340
01:54:18,218 --> 01:54:21,119
Sir, it's not needed.
You go and nab Sharad.

1341
01:54:22,088 --> 01:54:25,057
lf he flees from lndia,
we won't be able to nab him.

1342
01:54:25,792 --> 01:54:27,692
But Jia..
-Nothing will happen to Jia, sir.

1343
01:54:28,294 --> 01:54:30,455
l'm here.. you can go.

1344
01:54:31,898 --> 01:54:33,559
Are you sure? -Yes, l'm sure.

1345
01:54:35,101 --> 01:54:36,090
All the best.

1346
01:54:36,603 --> 01:54:40,232
Ajay, you too go.
Please go from here.

1347
01:54:40,340 --> 01:54:42,501
l didn't love you to leave
you alone like this.

1348
01:55:21,147 --> 01:55:23,206
Did you think you'll
flee the country..

1349
01:55:23,316 --> 01:55:24,806
..and we'll stand her applauding?

1350
01:55:25,585 --> 01:55:27,553
Stay back. Stay back.

1351
01:55:32,926 --> 01:55:34,291
You utter dialogues!

1352
01:55:35,495 --> 01:55:37,292
Throw his corpse in the ocean.

1353
01:55:50,343 --> 01:55:51,173
Jia!

1354
01:55:52,812 --> 01:55:55,804
lt's alphabetical code
can be Constellation.

1355
01:55:56,716 --> 01:55:59,310
Please, Ajay. Go from here.

1356
01:55:59,652 --> 01:56:01,415
Don't waste time. Please.

1357
01:56:33,753 --> 01:56:36,483
Constellation!

1358
01:57:09,288 --> 01:57:13,384
Jia, if alphabetical code
is Constellation..

1359
01:57:14,961 --> 01:57:16,826
..then numerical will
be related to it too.

1360
01:57:35,381 --> 01:57:36,405
Start the engine.

1361
01:57:36,816 --> 01:57:39,808
There is place for 7 digits.
What could it be?

1362
01:57:40,620 --> 01:57:41,746
lt won't be my code.

1363
01:57:42,588 --> 01:57:45,955
My code was only of six digits.

1364
01:57:46,526 --> 01:57:49,791
Constellations are twenty seven.

1365
01:57:49,896 --> 01:57:53,992
Moon revolves around these
constellations..

1366
01:57:55,001 --> 01:57:57,469
..in 27.3 days. Yes.

1367
01:57:57,570 --> 01:57:59,470
Ajay, two minutes are left.

1368
01:57:59,572 --> 01:58:01,506
Wait, Jia.
-Please. -Wait a second.

1369
01:58:03,509 --> 01:58:04,533
Point 3.

1370
01:58:05,511 --> 01:58:06,637
That means point 3.

1371
01:58:07,013 --> 01:58:08,446
3 is the seventh digit.

1372
01:58:09,382 --> 01:58:11,350
That makes it 27.

1373
01:58:11,884 --> 01:58:15,877
3. 13. 20.

1374
01:58:42,014 --> 01:58:44,448
Now there is no other option.
Enter the code.
