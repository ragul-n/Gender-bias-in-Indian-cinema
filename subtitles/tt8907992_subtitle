1
00:02:35,083 --> 00:02:38,833
The foreign king has come far away

2
00:02:38,916 --> 00:02:42,916
The foreign king has come far away

3
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,291
Has brought his well-groomed friends

4
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:51,291
Has brought his well-groomed friends

5
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:54,916
The foreign king has come far away

6
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,541
The handsome king

7
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:21,791
You're my queen and I'm your king

8
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:27,875
I've brought the ring of youth

9
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:32,041
You're my queen and I'm your king

10
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:35,375
I've brought the ring of youth

11
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:39,875
I speak my heart out, I don't shy away

12
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:45,541
I'll sing a country song on country music

13
00:03:48,291 --> 00:03:50,208
My king…

14
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:58,041
My king makes me feel like a queen

15
00:03:58,125 --> 00:04:04,291
I'll interlock you into my braid
I'll keep dancing

16
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:10,333
My king makes me feel like a queen

17
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:16,708
I'll interlock you into my braid
I'll keep dancing

18
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:38,833
I'll keep dancing
I'll keep dancing under the stars

19
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:44,666
We make a nice couple

20
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:48,833
I'll keep dancing
I'll keep dancing under the stars

21
00:04:49,416 --> 00:04:53,333
We make a nice couple

22
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:57,416
I'll dangle you in my earrings

23
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:02,375
I'll place you in my eyes
Instead of collyrium

24
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:07,875
My king…

25
00:05:09,916 --> 00:05:15,541
My king makes me feel like a queen

26
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:21,833
I'll interlock you into my braid
I'll keep dancing

27
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:27,541
My king makes me feel like a queen

28
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:34,208
I'll interlock you into my braid
I'll keep dancing

29
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:10,666
This is dangerous, Mira.

30
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,416
We are simple people.

31
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,333
It's not your job to go against gangsters.

32
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:17,833
It's the police's job
to send them to prison, not yours.

33
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,333
Shekhar, I'm a lawyer.

34
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:23,625
I know what you mean,

35
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:29,375
but I cannot just get scared
and let go of the case.

36
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:35,291
Mira, I really admire what you do.

37
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:38,708
But look at this. They're serious blokes.

38
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:44,416
- I'll file a police complaint.
- And how is that going to help?

39
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:48,166
We'll get police protection for a day
or a week or perhaps a month.

40
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:51,708
Then what? Today, it was a stone.
Tomorrow, it will be a bullet.

41
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:53,166
Shekhar, please. This…

42
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:56,250
Please what, Mira?

43
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:01,541
What if your pregnancy test is positive?
What will we do then?

44
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:08,291
Listen, Mira, please.

45
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:13,458
We are about to start a family. Right?

46
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:21,416
Your actions will not only compromise us,

47
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:24,625
but our child as well.

48
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:26,583
Yeah?

49
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:34,875
My client Joy Augustine has been
in hiding from the past three weeks

50
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:36,541
because of constant threats.

51
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:38,416
Even his family hasn't been spared.

52
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:42,125
Recently, though,
he came out of hiding courageously

53
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:45,833
to help the police solve the murder
of Mark Matthew, a pub employee.

54
00:09:45,916 --> 00:09:50,166
This pub is owned
by the accused, Mr. Jimmy Bagga,

55
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,416
whose gun was found in the killing.

56
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,333
Forensics have confirmed
that the bullet that killed Mark

57
00:09:55,416 --> 00:10:00,541
was a 9.07-millimeter caliber bullet
from a .37 short Colt pistol

58
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:03,125
owned, again, by Mr. Jimmy Bagga.

59
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:05,000
Wrong, Your Honor. As I mentioned earlier,

60
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:07,208
- I was not in town when this happened.
- Mr. Bagga...

61
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:10,708
I have nothing to do with
this unfortunate incident, sir. Please.

62
00:10:10,791 --> 00:10:14,250
Mr. Bagga, please do not speak
unless you're told to.

63
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:20,375
Keeping in mind the jury's verdict,
the witness statements,

64
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:22,666
and all the relevant evidence presented,

65
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:26,125
I conclude that the defendant, Mr. Bagga,

66
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:33,083
is proven to be guilty
and is sentenced to life imprisonment.

67
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:36,083
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

68
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:39,958
- Thank you, darling. You're wonderful.
- Thanks for all you did for my son.

69
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:41,833
- Take care of yourself.
- Always.

70
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:43,666
Stay away from guns and drugs.

71
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:46,583
- Stay away from trouble. Yeah?
- I promise I will.

72
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:50,583
- Okay, I'll see you.
- Thank you.

73
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:16,583
Hey, come here.

74
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:22,250
Have you thought of a name yet?

75
00:11:26,916 --> 00:11:27,958
Come on, let's go.

76
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:39,666
Wasn't that movie too intense?

77
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:43,583
You should stick to
watching light movies from now on.

78
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:47,041
Have you thought
about how they'll affect our child?

79
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:51,375
I don't want a child. I want a superstar.

80
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:55,041
I see. What's wrong
with having a boy-next-door?

81
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:56,958
I'm a Bachchan fan.

82
00:11:57,833 --> 00:11:59,833
Right. Which is why.

83
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:02,708
You good?

84
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:07,666
Keep this.

85
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:13,458
I have waited for this moment all my life.

86
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:17,125
Two months to go.

87
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:23,708
Tell me something.
Have you thought about work?

88
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:26,083
How you'll go about it?
How you'll manage it?

89
00:12:27,541 --> 00:12:29,708
No, I don't want to work.

90
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,166
I just want to spend
all my time with my baby.

91
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:36,833
Make his room,

92
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:41,250
play with him, just be with him.

93
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:48,458
Shekhar had told me
not to take that case, but I was adamant.

94
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:54,541
That mistake changed my life completely.

95
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:04,625
In your case, amnesia
is due to a psychological trauma.

96
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:08,291
In medical terms,
it's known as anterograde amnesia.

97
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:12,791
In this condition, a patient
cannot convert a short-term memory

98
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:16,083
into a long-term memory.

99
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:20,291
Patients retain things
only for a very short time.

100
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:27,875
The ones I… wanted to retain…

101
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:34,291
they're not in my life anymore.

102
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:42,625
We suppress the things we cannot forget.

103
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:46,041
And in that, vodka helps.

104
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:55,750
I had a miscarriage
because of that accident.

105
00:14:55,833 --> 00:14:57,833
I lost my child.

106
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:00,916
I was so busy fighting the pain,

107
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:05,583
I didn't realize
when I became dependent on alcohol,

108
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:09,833
and when it took Shekhar away from me.

109
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:21,791
I travel on this route every day
because it helps me look into my past.

110
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:23,666
I used to stay there.

111
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:27,208
My first house with Shekhar.

112
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:29,875
Best time of my life.

113
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:37,000
But the problem with best time
is that it doesn't last for long.

114
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:38,416
I should actually say that…

115
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:43,708
When I needed Shekhar the most…

116
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:46,916
he cheated on me.

117
00:15:48,916 --> 00:15:50,833
He betrayed me…

118
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,250
and married Anjali.

119
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:58,375
So this is your late-night hospital shift?

120
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:01,125
Mira, please don't create a scene.

121
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:25,958
Now Shekhar lives
in the same house with Anjali.

122
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:29,000
The place where I used to once live.

123
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:34,916
I travel in the same train every day.

124
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:40,708
I sit on this very seat every day
and watch the world outside.

125
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:46,583
I get to see
my most favorite house from here.

126
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:50,333
And I also get to see her…

127
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,625
the most favorite character of my story.

128
00:16:57,875 --> 00:17:00,958
I don't remember the first time I saw her.

129
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:09,000
But slowly,
I started feeling close to her…

130
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:13,000
because when I see her standing there,

131
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:16,333
I imagine myself.

132
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:21,708
Living a perfect life
with the perfect partner.

133
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:25,000
How can anyone stay so happy?

134
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:29,291
How can anyone's life be so perfect?

135
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:35,000
Will my life ever be
as perfect as her life is?

136
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,500
I don't know.

137
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,291
Maybe never.

138
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:42,458
The truth is…

139
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,958
I don't even know her name.

140
00:17:49,791 --> 00:17:50,791
Hello?

141
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:53,041
Yes?

142
00:17:57,083 --> 00:17:58,250
What's the name?

143
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:06,458
Where?

144
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:15,333
Okay, thanks.

145
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:24,041
There's a missing person report
from City Hospital.

146
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:27,791
Staff nurse "Nusrat John"
hasn't reported to duty in 24 hours.

147
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:29,458
And her phone is switched off.

148
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:30,916
Nusrat John?

149
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,375
Any criminal records
or any past records of disappearance?

150
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:37,166
No, ma'am. No such thing. She's clean.

151
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:53,541
She was here the afternoon of the 31st.
I met her myself.

152
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:55,333
Did she have a fight with anyone?

153
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:57,666
Not at all. Everyone loves her.

154
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:06,083
Anything you're missing that I should know
which might help? Anything?

155
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:09,791
There was this party
she wanted me to come for that evening

156
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:12,000
at 6:00, with her dance class friends.

157
00:19:12,708 --> 00:19:16,208
But, Officer, though we went there
together, I couldn't spot her later.

158
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,500
Whose party was it?

159
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:38,875
Which one?

160
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:41,208
That guy.

161
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:42,958
Nusrat had attended his party.

162
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,041
Since when do you know Nusrat?

163
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:49,791
Since the time she joined classes.

164
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:51,291
Are you trying to be smart?

165
00:19:52,916 --> 00:19:55,208
I can ask you these questions
back at the police station.

166
00:19:57,333 --> 00:20:00,125
We were dating before she was married.

167
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:02,208
Three months. That's it.

168
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:04,083
Really?

169
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:06,458
When did you see her last?

170
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,500
I don't remember.

171
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,041
Didn't she attend your party?

172
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:15,541
Don't know for sure.

173
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:19,291
There were more than 100 people.

174
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:20,958
And everyone was wearing masks.

175
00:20:21,916 --> 00:20:24,083
I didn't see her
even if she did attend it.

176
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:25,208
Are you sure?

177
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:27,708
Yeah.

178
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:30,708
Okay.

179
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:32,000
Can I go now?

180
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:45,625
We take many pro bono cases, too.

181
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:46,875
Our firm is small.

182
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:50,291
But trust me, it serves the people
just the way you think.

183
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:55,541
- Impressive.
- Thank you.

184
00:20:56,208 --> 00:21:00,916
But… you haven't taken
a single case since last year.

185
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:02,500
May I ask why?

186
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:08,500
Any problem?

187
00:22:02,416 --> 00:22:05,625
She reminds me of my past.

188
00:22:06,875 --> 00:22:08,958
I, too, used to be like her once.

189
00:22:10,041 --> 00:22:12,666
She's everything I lost.

190
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:16,291
I don't think
I have ever seen anyone so happy.

191
00:22:18,458 --> 00:22:21,125
I don't know whether this is jealously,

192
00:22:21,833 --> 00:22:25,125
self-pity, or desire.

193
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,583
I feel like flying when I see her dance.

194
00:22:31,791 --> 00:22:33,500
I feel like losing myself.

195
00:22:35,791 --> 00:22:40,833
Sometimes I think
if this is all real or is it just a dream?

196
00:23:06,125 --> 00:23:07,125
Hi.

197
00:23:08,083 --> 00:23:09,083
Anjali…

198
00:23:11,625 --> 00:23:13,125
What happened to you?

199
00:23:13,208 --> 00:23:17,250
Your ex, she keeps calling.
This is too much, Shekhar.

200
00:23:17,333 --> 00:23:18,791
How many times has she called you?

201
00:23:20,083 --> 00:23:21,250
She hasn't called me.

202
00:23:22,083 --> 00:23:23,208
Don't lie to me.

203
00:23:24,583 --> 00:23:27,208
- Okay, she has called me. Listen…
- I knew it.

204
00:23:27,291 --> 00:23:30,708
Make her understand, for God's sake.
She's losing it.

205
00:23:30,791 --> 00:23:32,625
Okay, I promise.

206
00:23:33,833 --> 00:23:36,208
I will talk to her, okay?

207
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:39,333
Don't let this ruin your mood.

208
00:23:39,416 --> 00:23:41,041
It's your birthday today, right?

209
00:23:42,125 --> 00:23:43,250
Let's take a picture.

210
00:23:46,583 --> 00:23:48,041
Look how pretty you look.

211
00:24:07,041 --> 00:24:08,041
Hey!

212
00:24:17,875 --> 00:24:20,333
Facebook and ex-wives
do not make good friends.

213
00:24:22,333 --> 00:24:25,125
Come on, Mira. It's over with him now.

214
00:24:27,958 --> 00:24:29,875
Can I have a couple of Jägers, please?

215
00:24:34,208 --> 00:24:35,208
Hey.

216
00:24:38,041 --> 00:24:40,541
Whatever little of Shekhar
that's left in you,

217
00:24:40,625 --> 00:24:41,833
I want to murder him.

218
00:24:44,208 --> 00:24:45,250
Come on.

219
00:24:50,625 --> 00:24:51,750
Yes, girl.

220
00:24:54,916 --> 00:24:55,916
Yes!

221
00:24:57,041 --> 00:24:58,250
Two more please. Repeat.

222
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:15,166
Monsoon cheated the clouds
The rain claims

223
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:20,458
I learned angry tears are not the same

224
00:25:25,541 --> 00:25:31,125
Monsoon cheated the clouds
The rain claims

225
00:25:31,208 --> 00:25:35,791
I learned angry tears are not the same

226
00:25:35,875 --> 00:25:41,958
I don't know why doesn't God hear
The pleas of the hurting soul

227
00:25:43,125 --> 00:25:47,833
I feel cheated, I feel mad

228
00:25:48,416 --> 00:25:53,833
I feel burned, I feel like a sad fool

229
00:26:14,875 --> 00:26:17,041
I feel cheated

230
00:26:19,833 --> 00:26:24,083
The deceitful bird has left
The wind heartbroken

231
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:30,208
The peepal tree is withering away

232
00:26:35,541 --> 00:26:40,958
The deceitful bird has left
The wind heartbroken

233
00:26:41,041 --> 00:26:46,000
The peepal tree is withering away

234
00:26:46,083 --> 00:26:51,458
Only the one who hurts screams in pain

235
00:26:51,541 --> 00:26:56,750
I feel cheated, I feel mad

236
00:26:56,833 --> 00:27:01,833
I feel burned, I feel like a sad fool

237
00:27:02,458 --> 00:27:04,958
I feel cheated

238
00:27:07,458 --> 00:27:10,208
I feel burned

239
00:27:21,291 --> 00:27:23,333
Kunal, a few friends of Nusrat
from the dance class

240
00:27:23,416 --> 00:27:25,541
said that she visited
a psychiatrist regularly.

241
00:27:25,625 --> 00:27:27,333
We need to question him.

242
00:27:30,375 --> 00:27:33,375
Dr. Hamid, I'm Inspector Kaur.

243
00:27:33,458 --> 00:27:35,666
Nusrat was very lonely at heart.

244
00:27:36,625 --> 00:27:38,000
Extremely emotional.

245
00:27:38,083 --> 00:27:40,375
She is only missing, Dr. Hamid.

246
00:27:40,458 --> 00:27:41,916
Why did you use "was"?

247
00:27:44,125 --> 00:27:45,375
I didn't mean that.

248
00:27:45,458 --> 00:27:47,208
What did you mean then?

249
00:27:50,041 --> 00:27:52,291
When was your last session with Nusrat?

250
00:27:55,166 --> 00:27:56,166
30th.

251
00:27:57,041 --> 00:27:58,625
A day before she disappeared.

252
00:28:00,916 --> 00:28:01,916
Yes.

253
00:28:04,083 --> 00:28:07,500
Any unusual behavior?
Did she have any problems with anyone?

254
00:28:09,166 --> 00:28:10,166
No.

255
00:28:13,291 --> 00:28:14,500
Last week…

256
00:28:15,291 --> 00:28:18,250
when I went to meet her
after her dance classes,

257
00:28:18,833 --> 00:28:20,666
she was talking to someone.

258
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:21,750
Hi.

259
00:28:22,958 --> 00:28:24,000
Where's my money?

260
00:28:25,583 --> 00:28:27,083
Don't fuck around with me, girl.

261
00:28:27,166 --> 00:28:30,500
If by tomorrow, you don't show up
with the next installment,

262
00:28:31,375 --> 00:28:33,166
I'll expose you to Anand.

263
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:35,708
You'll get your money.
Just stop chasing me.

264
00:28:38,625 --> 00:28:40,291
I did ask her about it,

265
00:28:40,375 --> 00:28:42,583
but she totally avoided that conversation.

266
00:28:43,416 --> 00:28:45,416
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

267
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:48,500
- Who was that?
- Just an old friend. Come.

268
00:28:48,583 --> 00:28:50,500
I thought she is hiding something.

269
00:28:51,416 --> 00:28:54,208
I guess she… had her secrets.

270
00:28:56,250 --> 00:29:01,416
Dr. Hamid,
has Nusrat ever told you about Rajiv?

271
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:02,625
Her ex-boyfriend.

272
00:29:04,708 --> 00:29:07,125
Rajiv was never her boyfriend.

273
00:29:07,208 --> 00:29:08,916
In fact, she never liked him.

274
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,833
- Bye, see you.
- See you.

275
00:29:14,208 --> 00:29:16,083
- You're all right?
- Yeah.

276
00:29:16,166 --> 00:29:18,125
You didn't call me back. I was waiting.

277
00:29:19,041 --> 00:29:20,458
I wasn't supposed to.

278
00:29:20,541 --> 00:29:22,375
You know I don't like to wait.

279
00:29:22,458 --> 00:29:25,083
- It's not my problem, Rajiv.
- I'm not done yet.

280
00:29:25,666 --> 00:29:27,833
Next time I call you,
make sure you pick up.

281
00:29:28,416 --> 00:29:29,708
That's not gonna happen.

282
00:29:29,791 --> 00:29:32,208
- Leave my hand.
- Make me.

283
00:29:32,291 --> 00:29:34,083
Leave my hand, asshole.

284
00:29:35,166 --> 00:29:37,041
At least I'm better
than your bloody husband!

285
00:29:40,375 --> 00:29:42,458
Okay then, all right, Dr. Hamid.

286
00:29:42,541 --> 00:29:44,125
Thank you for your cooperation.

287
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:46,083
Officer.

288
00:29:47,083 --> 00:29:48,166
Find her.

289
00:29:48,916 --> 00:29:50,166
Please.

290
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:52,666
I will.

291
00:29:59,208 --> 00:30:00,728
- Is everything in there?
- Yes, ma'am.

292
00:30:00,791 --> 00:30:03,208
All the recordings
between Dr. Hamid and Nusrat.

293
00:30:04,208 --> 00:30:05,291
All right, thank you.

294
00:30:07,166 --> 00:30:10,125
Imagine you could fly.

295
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:15,541
Then where would you go right now?

296
00:30:19,041 --> 00:30:20,208
Deep into the forest.

297
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:24,750
In absolute silence
where you can feel the breath you take.

298
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:41,625
If given a chance to reverse
any decision you have made in the past…

299
00:30:42,375 --> 00:30:43,625
that you'd want to change…

300
00:30:44,833 --> 00:30:47,125
What would you
want to change from your past?

301
00:30:52,958 --> 00:30:54,750
I don't want to change my past.

302
00:30:57,708 --> 00:30:58,958
I don't have any regrets.

303
00:31:03,375 --> 00:31:04,916
I want to change my present.

304
00:31:06,208 --> 00:31:07,208
Nusrat.

305
00:31:08,875 --> 00:31:10,166
Are you fucking deaf?

306
00:31:13,333 --> 00:31:14,333
Nusrat!

307
00:31:15,916 --> 00:31:17,500
What the fuck were you doing?

308
00:31:18,833 --> 00:31:20,833
Didn't you hear me calling out to you?

309
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:22,875
Nusrat, I'm talking to you!

310
00:31:26,458 --> 00:31:27,833
What do you want to talk about?

311
00:31:28,458 --> 00:31:31,041
I had called the hospital.
You weren't there.

312
00:31:32,291 --> 00:31:33,666
Care to tell me?

313
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:37,916
You wanted to talk or did you
run out of money to buy drugs?

314
00:31:42,416 --> 00:31:47,583
You're hurting me. Let me go.

315
00:31:48,416 --> 00:31:51,083
You're hurting me, Anand. Let me go!

316
00:31:55,916 --> 00:31:57,666
One day, I'm going to kill you.

317
00:32:12,791 --> 00:32:14,625
Anand is very possessive.

318
00:32:14,708 --> 00:32:17,541
He's dominating and tries controlling me.

319
00:32:26,541 --> 00:32:30,250
I told you I'll give you your money, mate.
Stop troubling me every day.

320
00:32:30,791 --> 00:32:31,791
Thank you.

321
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:47,750
The wife is missing
and the husband is busy shopping.

322
00:32:48,416 --> 00:32:50,708
It's her hospital that files
a missing person's report.

323
00:32:52,041 --> 00:32:53,916
Excuse me? And who are you?

324
00:32:58,416 --> 00:33:00,500
- Where is Nusrat?
- I don't know.

325
00:33:00,583 --> 00:33:03,208
- Then who does?
- How the hell am I supposed to know?

326
00:33:06,708 --> 00:33:11,291
Mr. Joshi, in such cases,
husbands are often the prime suspects.

327
00:33:13,291 --> 00:33:14,500
It's your choice.

328
00:33:16,791 --> 00:33:18,083
Anything I should know?

329
00:33:19,333 --> 00:33:20,666
We had our differences.

330
00:33:21,458 --> 00:33:23,041
Like normal couples do.

331
00:33:23,125 --> 00:33:26,000
In case of a normal married couple,
if the wife goes missing,

332
00:33:26,083 --> 00:33:29,291
her husband files a report.

333
00:33:29,875 --> 00:33:31,541
Doesn't seem to be the case here.

334
00:33:33,916 --> 00:33:35,000
A word of advice.

335
00:33:36,583 --> 00:33:38,916
Hiding the truth will only
bring you more trouble.

336
00:33:45,458 --> 00:33:48,291
- We were contemplating divorce.
- Why?

337
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:51,333
I think she's having an affair.

338
00:34:14,708 --> 00:34:18,125
I felt a little strange
that day when I saw her.

339
00:34:19,625 --> 00:34:21,083
Something wasn't right.

340
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,750
Perhaps something was bothering her?

341
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,916
I wish I could meet her, talk to her.

342
00:34:31,291 --> 00:34:32,416
Who is that?

343
00:34:33,958 --> 00:34:36,000
I have never seen him before.

344
00:34:40,833 --> 00:34:41,833
Who is he?

345
00:34:43,875 --> 00:34:45,750
What are they talking about?

346
00:34:46,333 --> 00:34:48,208
Is she having an affair?

347
00:34:49,125 --> 00:34:50,916
This is not her husband.

348
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,375
No, no, no.

349
00:34:53,041 --> 00:34:54,458
What are you doing?

350
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:57,750
Don't be stupid.
You can't ruin your marriage like this.

351
00:34:58,375 --> 00:35:00,833
No, no, no.

352
00:35:40,625 --> 00:35:42,625
Why is she cheating on her husband?

353
00:35:43,833 --> 00:35:45,041
What can you do?

354
00:35:47,625 --> 00:35:48,875
She's doing…

355
00:35:51,916 --> 00:35:53,875
the same thing that Shekhar did to me.

356
00:35:56,916 --> 00:36:00,083
Divorce is a sign of a strong woman.

357
00:36:01,625 --> 00:36:04,666
It's proof that
you don't take shit from anyone.

358
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:12,458
The perfect image I had of her in mind.

359
00:36:15,166 --> 00:36:17,458
She's ruining it.

360
00:36:20,166 --> 00:36:22,041
She's breaking it. She's…

361
00:36:24,875 --> 00:36:28,375
She's making a big fucking mistake!

362
00:36:29,125 --> 00:36:31,583
What will you get out of all this?

363
00:36:32,583 --> 00:36:34,375
Are you even listening to me?

364
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:36,541
You are losing it!

365
00:36:38,375 --> 00:36:39,791
Forget her.

366
00:36:44,708 --> 00:36:45,791
I can't forget her.

367
00:36:46,958 --> 00:36:48,250
I can't!

368
00:36:49,875 --> 00:36:50,875
She's wrong.

369
00:36:52,333 --> 00:36:56,000
She's the one who is losing it, not me!

370
00:36:57,083 --> 00:36:58,166
I'm not losing it!

371
00:36:59,458 --> 00:37:01,208
I have to stop her.

372
00:37:01,291 --> 00:37:04,791
- You sound betrayed.
- I have been betrayed.

373
00:37:06,041 --> 00:37:10,791
It feels like I'm fucking
losing everything again!

374
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,291
What Shekhar did to me, when he cheated…

375
00:37:18,375 --> 00:37:20,208
- Can we just...
- Today, once again…

376
00:37:20,291 --> 00:37:22,000
Stop talking about Shekhar.

377
00:37:27,083 --> 00:37:29,250
I feel like cursing him…

378
00:37:31,458 --> 00:37:32,750
I'll do just that.

379
00:37:34,041 --> 00:37:37,250
- Shekhar, you fucking son of a bitch!
- Stop it.

380
00:37:37,333 --> 00:37:40,333
Calm down. You're better than this.

381
00:37:42,041 --> 00:37:45,166
- If I could...
- You're too drunk. You should go home now.

382
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:46,250
If I could…

383
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:49,083
I would… I'd just go to her house…

384
00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:57,666
I'd grab her by her hair…

385
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:00,708
and smash her face on the table!

386
00:38:07,166 --> 00:38:12,625
Smash it!

387
00:38:12,708 --> 00:38:18,291
Till she fucking dies!

388
00:38:23,791 --> 00:38:25,666
Mira, don't do anything stupid.

389
00:38:26,333 --> 00:38:27,708
You will regret it.

390
00:38:42,416 --> 00:38:43,791
Ma'am, have a look at this.

391
00:38:52,166 --> 00:38:53,791
Where did you get this from?

392
00:38:53,875 --> 00:38:55,916
I questioned the guests
who had attended the party.

393
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,916
One of the guests
shared this video with us.

394
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,125
I also checked
that place's CCTV footage, ma'am.

395
00:39:00,208 --> 00:39:04,541
Look at this video.
Rajiv is forcing Nusrat into the basement.

396
00:39:04,625 --> 00:39:07,333
After we searched the place,
we found a broken mirror,

397
00:39:07,416 --> 00:39:10,208
a few drops of blood,
and Nusrat's mask there.

398
00:39:11,333 --> 00:39:12,416
We gotta go.

399
00:39:26,166 --> 00:39:27,166
Rajiv, bro.

400
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:29,050
- You need to go. The police are here.
- What?

401
00:39:29,083 --> 00:39:30,523
- They're coming for you now.
- Shit.

402
00:39:30,583 --> 00:39:31,708
You need to go, dude.

403
00:39:34,666 --> 00:39:37,708
- Stop there. You! Stop!
- This way!

404
00:39:37,791 --> 00:39:40,166
- Stop! Don't move!
- That side quick.

405
00:39:41,375 --> 00:39:42,208
Don't move!

406
00:39:42,291 --> 00:39:43,291
Get him!

407
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,166
You, stop!

408
00:39:53,666 --> 00:39:55,750
This way. There he goes.

409
00:40:03,083 --> 00:40:04,875
- Where did he go?
- There.

410
00:40:12,166 --> 00:40:13,416
You, stop!

411
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:20,833
Just stay fucking there!

412
00:40:27,833 --> 00:40:31,250
The mirror in the basement
of the party hall is broken.

413
00:40:31,333 --> 00:40:33,000
There are blood stains on the floor.

414
00:40:33,083 --> 00:40:35,041
Do you want to tell me what's going on?

415
00:40:43,458 --> 00:40:47,416
You were forcing yourself on Nusrat.
We have the CCTV footage.

416
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:49,208
What the hell is going on?

417
00:40:51,875 --> 00:40:53,125
You should talk to Komal.

418
00:40:54,916 --> 00:40:56,083
She'll tell you the truth.

419
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:02,208
Who is Komal now?

420
00:41:02,333 --> 00:41:05,541
Don't be such a tease. Let me see.

421
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:09,791
What're you doing?

422
00:41:09,875 --> 00:41:13,625
I thought you want to be a starlet.
Johnny's going to make you a viral star.

423
00:41:13,708 --> 00:41:15,916
You know how many
YouTube followers I've got?

424
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:18,458
Ma'am, this is Komal.

425
00:41:19,125 --> 00:41:20,583
That's Tony, her boyfriend.

426
00:41:21,458 --> 00:41:24,708
And that's Johnny.
Johnny had shot this video on the phone.

427
00:41:26,708 --> 00:41:30,125
Explain the blood stains
on the floor and the broken mirror.

428
00:41:34,333 --> 00:41:35,208
I'm waiting.

429
00:41:35,291 --> 00:41:38,250
This bastard touched my girl.
I should have killed him.

430
00:41:38,333 --> 00:41:39,791
- Hey!
- Rajiv!

431
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:43,666
No!

432
00:41:44,875 --> 00:41:46,125
Tony!

433
00:41:46,208 --> 00:41:47,250
Shut up!

434
00:41:49,333 --> 00:41:50,166
Fuck!

435
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:53,916
Ma'am, Nusrat left the party early.

436
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,250
She was in a hurry.

437
00:41:58,500 --> 00:41:59,583
It was my mistake.

438
00:42:00,750 --> 00:42:02,958
I should have stayed away from Rajiv.

439
00:42:04,416 --> 00:42:05,958
This was found in his bag.

440
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:12,875
- Take them out of my sight, please.
- Come on, you three. Come.

441
00:42:22,208 --> 00:42:26,666
Ma'am, if it's not him,
then who committed this crime?

442
00:44:21,291 --> 00:44:22,375
Hey!

443
00:44:55,333 --> 00:44:56,625
Hey!

444
00:46:35,416 --> 00:46:37,166
This is forensic.

445
00:46:37,250 --> 00:46:39,041
Go on forensics. Over.

446
00:46:39,125 --> 00:46:41,666
We have identified the body of Nusrat.

447
00:46:41,750 --> 00:46:47,583
We are doing a test kit,
but we need more manpower.

448
00:47:20,958 --> 00:47:24,583
According to forensics,
Nusrat was killed and then dragged.

449
00:47:24,666 --> 00:47:26,541
There are injuries on her back.

450
00:47:28,041 --> 00:47:30,791
That means the killer
wanted to kill her somewhere else,

451
00:47:31,375 --> 00:47:32,833
but he later changed his plans.

452
00:47:33,833 --> 00:47:35,708
There's one more thing, ma'am.

453
00:47:35,791 --> 00:47:38,333
Someone had come
to meet Nusrat that evening.

454
00:47:39,250 --> 00:47:40,291
What do you mean?

455
00:47:40,375 --> 00:47:42,416
- Let me show you something.
- Sure.

456
00:47:43,250 --> 00:47:45,458
Ma'am, this is
the CCTV footage from Nusrat's house.

457
00:47:45,541 --> 00:47:48,416
From the entry gate. That's Mira Kapoor.

458
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:51,291
But, Kunal, isn't it possible
that she was there to meet Anand?

459
00:47:52,958 --> 00:47:56,208
But according to Anand,
he's never seen her before.

460
00:47:58,041 --> 00:48:00,583
And, ma'am,
if you look closely, she looks angry.

461
00:48:00,666 --> 00:48:01,916
She might be drunk.

462
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
She has a history of alcohol abuse.

463
00:48:08,833 --> 00:48:10,583
What else do we know about Mira Kapoor?

464
00:48:10,666 --> 00:48:13,458
Well, like I said, alcoholic, divorced.

465
00:48:13,541 --> 00:48:16,041
She's a lawyer,
but for the last year she's been inactive.

466
00:48:16,875 --> 00:48:18,625
And how is she connected to Nusrat?

467
00:48:20,166 --> 00:48:24,333
Well, 30 feet away
from where we found Nusrat's body,

468
00:48:26,166 --> 00:48:27,166
we found this.

469
00:48:27,250 --> 00:48:29,416
Mira Kapoor, CitizenCard.

470
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:33,333
And we found blood samples
that don't match Nusrat.

471
00:48:33,416 --> 00:48:34,708
We have sent it for analysis.

472
00:48:34,791 --> 00:48:37,541
- This is not a coincidence.
- No, it's not.

473
00:48:38,250 --> 00:48:41,083
Now, ma'am, Mira stays in Redbridge,

474
00:48:41,166 --> 00:48:43,166
but she got down
at Greenwich station at 6:00.

475
00:48:43,250 --> 00:48:47,250
And she was outside Nusrat's house,
intoxicated, at 6:30, right?

476
00:48:47,333 --> 00:48:51,291
Exactly. And then she
reaches her home at 11:00 p.m.

477
00:48:51,375 --> 00:48:53,416
That means when Nusrat was murdered,

478
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:56,750
Mira Kapoor
was most probably in Greenwich.

479
00:48:56,833 --> 00:48:58,125
Yes, ma'am.

480
00:48:58,208 --> 00:48:59,416
And of course, looks like

481
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:02,041
she was present at the forest
where Nusrat's body was found.

482
00:49:05,583 --> 00:49:07,791
Guys, I need all the CCTV footage

483
00:49:07,875 --> 00:49:10,791
of all the shops and stations
close to Greenwich forest.

484
00:49:10,875 --> 00:49:14,750
We need to find out where exactly
Mira Kapoor was when the crime took place.

485
00:49:14,833 --> 00:49:15,833
Yes, ma'am.

486
00:50:29,791 --> 00:50:31,041
You fucking son of a bitch!

487
00:50:32,583 --> 00:50:35,708
Smash it till she fucking dies!

488
00:50:47,750 --> 00:50:49,041
If I could…

489
00:50:49,125 --> 00:50:52,125
I would… I'd just go to her house…

490
00:50:53,791 --> 00:50:56,125
and grab the back of her head.

491
00:50:56,750 --> 00:50:59,625
I would jerk her back, take her head…

492
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:05,458
and smash her…

493
00:51:05,541 --> 00:51:07,458
till she fucking dies.

494
00:51:07,541 --> 00:51:08,541
Hey!

495
00:51:43,208 --> 00:51:45,750
My memory is a puzzle…

496
00:51:48,125 --> 00:51:49,791
with a bunch of missing pieces.

497
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,208
What I remember…

498
00:52:00,083 --> 00:52:04,791
is something… I'd preferred not to.

499
00:52:06,666 --> 00:52:10,041
Congratulations
to the new head of cardiology.

500
00:52:10,125 --> 00:52:12,958
Finally, we have good news in our lives.

501
00:52:14,583 --> 00:52:15,583
Cheers.

502
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:30,916
What happened? How did you get hurt?

503
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
I tried to stop you
after your fourth drink.

504
00:52:34,166 --> 00:52:36,250
- You hit me with a corkscrew.
- Shit.

505
00:52:37,291 --> 00:52:38,500
Shit, I'm so sorry.

506
00:52:39,541 --> 00:52:41,375
My ex-husband used to say,

507
00:52:41,458 --> 00:52:43,125
"If you apologize…

508
00:52:44,791 --> 00:52:47,250
but keep doing the same damn thing

509
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,500
again and again and again…

510
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,416
it doesn't count, Mira."

511
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:58,375
The furniture of your house sucks.

512
00:53:00,041 --> 00:53:01,916
I'm really sorry for this.

513
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:07,750
My bosses were in there.

514
00:53:08,416 --> 00:53:10,666
This is ruining my reputation, my career.

515
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,500
You always think about yourself.

516
00:53:18,125 --> 00:53:20,125
I could never tell him…

517
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:23,875
that it wasn't me.

518
00:53:26,666 --> 00:53:28,333
That was my wound.

519
00:53:29,125 --> 00:53:30,125
The wound…

520
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:33,333
that never healed.

521
00:53:33,916 --> 00:53:35,208
Slowly…

522
00:53:36,875 --> 00:53:41,708
that wound spread all through my body.

523
00:53:55,208 --> 00:53:56,833
Mira, please sign these papers.

524
00:53:57,750 --> 00:53:59,000
What is it?

525
00:53:59,083 --> 00:54:00,250
Divorce papers.

526
00:54:00,333 --> 00:54:02,541
I'm done with our toxic relationship.

527
00:54:03,166 --> 00:54:05,125
This isn't the Mira I got married to.

528
00:54:06,125 --> 00:54:07,208
Have you gone mad?

529
00:54:07,291 --> 00:54:10,250
Mira, try to understand
what I'm saying. Please!

530
00:54:10,333 --> 00:54:11,583
Please just sign the papers.

531
00:54:11,666 --> 00:54:13,958
Both of us are unhappy.
Please try to understand.

532
00:54:14,041 --> 00:54:16,750
Shekhar, are you even listening?

533
00:54:16,833 --> 00:54:20,166
Mira, I beg you, let's end this.
The papers are right there, just...

534
00:54:20,250 --> 00:54:22,000
Shekhar!

535
00:54:23,916 --> 00:54:25,250
I'm here today…

536
00:54:26,625 --> 00:54:33,333
because there's a part of my past
that's gone missing.

537
00:54:38,375 --> 00:54:39,375
And I…

538
00:54:42,041 --> 00:54:44,458
want to remember it.

539
00:54:50,041 --> 00:54:51,375
I fear that…

540
00:54:53,458 --> 00:54:55,416
I might never be able to remember it.

541
00:55:01,833 --> 00:55:06,416
But I need to change my future.

542
00:55:11,583 --> 00:55:12,625
And for that…

543
00:55:16,375 --> 00:55:17,833
I want to remember.

544
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:22,666
I have to remember.

545
00:55:26,208 --> 00:55:28,166
I have to remember.

546
00:55:32,333 --> 00:55:35,208
I have to remember
what happened that night.

547
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:39,625
I have hurt Shekhar
in the past when I was drunk.

548
00:55:40,291 --> 00:55:45,833
I think perhaps, this time,
I have done the same with Nusrat.

549
00:55:53,416 --> 00:55:56,041
- Hey! How was class?
- Fine.

550
00:55:56,125 --> 00:55:59,083
- We drank a bit too much the other day.
- Yes.

551
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,750
- What the…
- Yeah.

552
00:56:03,833 --> 00:56:05,708
- How did you get hurt?
- Listen…

553
00:56:05,791 --> 00:56:08,500
- I need to talk to you.
- Ms. Mira Kapoor?

554
00:56:10,708 --> 00:56:12,583
We're here for a murder investigation.

555
00:56:12,666 --> 00:56:13,958
Can I ask you some questions?

556
00:56:19,958 --> 00:56:21,500
Do you know her?

557
00:56:24,791 --> 00:56:27,916
We found her body
near the lake in Greenwich forest.

558
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,125
No.

559
00:56:30,250 --> 00:56:31,333
Are you sure?

560
00:56:32,541 --> 00:56:33,541
Yeah.

561
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,666
So let me clarify this
once again with you.

562
00:56:38,875 --> 00:56:41,750
You never knew and never met Nusrat?

563
00:56:42,541 --> 00:56:44,833
And that day you were at work, right?

564
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:46,500
Yeah.

565
00:56:47,958 --> 00:56:50,416
You got down
at Greenwich station at 6:00 p.m.

566
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:53,000
because you wanted
to meet your ex-husband,

567
00:56:53,750 --> 00:56:56,750
but you canceled your plan
because you were not feeling well.

568
00:56:58,583 --> 00:57:01,083
Then you took a train
from Greenwich station

569
00:57:01,166 --> 00:57:03,583
and reached home around 11:00 p.m.?

570
00:57:04,250 --> 00:57:05,250
Correct?

571
00:57:06,041 --> 00:57:07,041
Yeah.

572
00:57:12,083 --> 00:57:13,208
What are you?

573
00:57:14,666 --> 00:57:15,708
A compulsive liar?

574
00:57:19,250 --> 00:57:20,708
How much more are you gonna lie?

575
00:57:23,166 --> 00:57:24,166
Let's start with this.

576
00:57:27,416 --> 00:57:30,333
Is this you
outside Nusrat's house at 6:30 p.m.?

577
00:57:33,041 --> 00:57:34,166
What were you doing there?

578
00:57:40,875 --> 00:57:42,458
I have no recollection of this.

579
00:57:44,125 --> 00:57:47,750
Must be a mistake.
Maybe I went to the wrong address.

580
00:57:47,833 --> 00:57:49,041
Give me the CitizenCard.

581
00:57:54,208 --> 00:57:55,500
How do you explain this?

582
00:57:57,750 --> 00:58:01,875
We found your CitizenCard
30 feet away from the body.

583
00:58:06,625 --> 00:58:09,541
- It was stolen a few days ago.
- Did you file a report for that?

584
00:58:10,125 --> 00:58:12,083
- I didn't find the time.
- Another lie.

585
00:58:15,125 --> 00:58:16,166
From 6:00 to 11:00…

586
00:58:17,583 --> 00:58:19,375
you didn't meet your ex-husband.

587
00:58:20,291 --> 00:58:23,875
- How did you spend these five hours?
- Officer, just take it easy.

588
00:58:24,458 --> 00:58:25,458
Excuse me?

589
00:58:26,250 --> 00:58:29,375
Your friend has been lying for 30 minutes.

590
00:58:29,458 --> 00:58:31,291
Not just to me but to you as well.

591
00:58:31,375 --> 00:58:33,000
She hasn't had a job since one year.

592
00:58:33,083 --> 00:58:35,041
Have you ever asked her
where she goes every day?

593
00:58:36,250 --> 00:58:38,916
Our team is searching the crime scene.

594
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,208
I don't have anything
to arrest you right now.

595
00:58:41,791 --> 00:58:43,458
Pray that we don't find anything.

596
00:58:45,916 --> 00:58:46,916
And…

597
00:58:47,833 --> 00:58:49,208
do yourself a favor.

598
00:58:50,666 --> 00:58:51,833
Remember.

599
00:58:52,625 --> 00:58:53,833
Try to recall.

600
00:58:57,375 --> 00:58:59,125
What were you thinking, Mira?

601
00:59:00,125 --> 00:59:03,583
Do you think you might have hurt her?

602
00:59:13,333 --> 00:59:14,583
I don't remember.

603
00:59:14,666 --> 00:59:18,166
Your drinking
is worsening the amnesia, Mira.

604
00:59:20,958 --> 00:59:23,958
But I can't sleep without it.

605
00:59:24,833 --> 00:59:26,875
I can't sleep.

606
00:59:26,958 --> 00:59:29,000
Passing out is not sleeping, Mira.

607
00:59:31,833 --> 00:59:33,625
Do you realize what can happen?

608
00:59:34,750 --> 00:59:37,875
You will have to remember
what happened at the forest.

609
00:59:37,958 --> 00:59:41,708
And if you can't remember,
there's going to be a lot of problems.

610
00:59:43,583 --> 00:59:44,583
Fucking die…

611
00:59:46,333 --> 00:59:47,333
Hey!

612
01:00:29,958 --> 01:00:30,958
Anand.

613
01:00:33,125 --> 01:00:34,125
Was it him?

614
01:00:43,375 --> 01:00:44,375
It's him.

615
01:00:48,041 --> 01:00:50,750
Dr. Hamid, Nusrat's psychiatrist.

616
01:00:52,333 --> 01:00:53,750
I had my doubts about him.

617
01:00:55,166 --> 01:00:56,250
It's definitely him.

618
01:00:57,250 --> 01:00:58,875
You are a lawyer.

619
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:00,375
I need to ask you something.

620
01:01:00,958 --> 01:01:02,583
I'd hired a private investigator…

621
01:01:03,166 --> 01:01:04,583
to follow Nusrat.

622
01:01:06,458 --> 01:01:09,625
If the cops come to know,
will I face a problem?

623
01:01:13,208 --> 01:01:15,458
Look, amnesia is memory loss.

624
01:01:16,250 --> 01:01:19,541
New memories cannot be created
because of brain damage.

625
01:01:20,666 --> 01:01:22,041
Rest of the functions are normal.

626
01:01:26,833 --> 01:01:28,083
So what about Mira?

627
01:01:29,666 --> 01:01:32,500
Is she… violent?

628
01:01:34,291 --> 01:01:35,416
I don't know.

629
01:01:38,041 --> 01:01:39,041
Fine.

630
01:01:39,916 --> 01:01:41,166
Then write down

631
01:01:41,250 --> 01:01:44,833
that Mira never told you anything
about Nusrat and sign the document.

632
01:01:45,416 --> 01:01:49,541
And God forbid, if I find out
that you know something,

633
01:01:49,625 --> 01:01:53,666
then you will not only be an accomplice
but also be charged for perjury.

634
01:02:02,875 --> 01:02:06,791
Mira had come to me
a few days after the incident.

635
01:02:08,416 --> 01:02:12,583
She said she
followed Nusrat into the forest…

636
01:02:14,041 --> 01:02:15,083
and then she blacked out.

637
01:02:15,166 --> 01:02:16,791
She doesn't remember more than that.

638
01:02:16,875 --> 01:02:19,166
I don't need more, doctor. Thank you so...

639
01:02:19,250 --> 01:02:22,750
Please understand, I know Mira very well.
She will never hurt anyone.

640
01:02:22,833 --> 01:02:23,833
Sure.

641
01:02:24,458 --> 01:02:25,666
I have something for you.

642
01:02:26,583 --> 01:02:29,291
You had asked me
to look out for CCTV footages

643
01:02:29,375 --> 01:02:31,500
at the nearby stations, shops, etc.

644
01:02:31,583 --> 01:02:35,000
We have received this CCTV file
from the High Road station.

645
01:02:35,083 --> 01:02:37,916
On 31st night at 10:30 p.m.,

646
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:41,000
Mira is seen at the platform,
waiting for the last train.

647
01:02:43,625 --> 01:02:47,125
High Road station? That's a small station.
What is she doing there?

648
01:02:48,125 --> 01:02:50,833
Maybe because it's
the nearest one to Greenwich forest?

649
01:02:53,791 --> 01:02:55,333
Have a look at her forehead.

650
01:02:56,750 --> 01:02:57,750
That's blood.

651
01:03:00,041 --> 01:03:01,375
It looks like fresh blood.

652
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:05,250
No, but why would Mira want
to kill Nusrat in the first place?

653
01:03:05,333 --> 01:03:06,833
I mean, it doesn't make sense.

654
01:03:08,083 --> 01:03:09,416
I would jerk her back,

655
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:11,541
take her head and smash her!

656
01:03:11,625 --> 01:03:14,416
Smash her.

657
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:17,375
Smash her till she fucking dies!

658
01:04:06,250 --> 01:04:08,583
- Hello.
- Mira Kapoor?

659
01:04:10,041 --> 01:04:11,916
I saw you on the 31st.

660
01:04:14,500 --> 01:04:15,833
Who is this?

661
01:04:16,791 --> 01:04:17,875
I am Walter.

662
01:04:18,458 --> 01:04:20,375
I know what happened
that night in the forest.

663
01:04:21,708 --> 01:04:23,166
But everything has a price.

664
01:04:23,875 --> 01:04:27,416
I'll pay. Just tell me
the time and the price.

665
01:04:27,500 --> 01:04:29,000
Good but don't involve the cops.

666
01:04:29,083 --> 01:04:32,041
I'll send you the drop-off details
when the time is right.

667
01:04:40,166 --> 01:04:43,333
Nusrat's murder took place
between 9:00 and 10:00 p.m.

668
01:04:43,416 --> 01:04:47,208
We have CCTV footage of you
at High Road station at 10:30 p.m.

669
01:04:48,375 --> 01:04:50,625
You don't have any alibi for that time.

670
01:04:50,708 --> 01:04:52,916
You are wasting my time.

671
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:58,291
Your visit to Nusrat's house,
station CCTV timings, Citizen pass…

672
01:04:58,833 --> 01:05:00,375
Your injuries, blood…

673
01:05:02,708 --> 01:05:03,833
You are a lawyer.

674
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,333
A damn good one.

675
01:05:09,291 --> 01:05:11,083
You know
what this means to the prosecution.

676
01:05:15,041 --> 01:05:17,041
I don't have a motive
to commit this murder.

677
01:05:17,666 --> 01:05:22,500
All these points and evidences
that you have are circumstantial.

678
01:05:23,333 --> 01:05:24,416
They won't stand.

679
01:05:25,708 --> 01:05:27,041
And my amnesia?

680
01:05:29,125 --> 01:05:30,375
Have you forgotten about that?

681
01:05:31,458 --> 01:05:34,250
This isn't enough. You cannot do anything.

682
01:05:34,833 --> 01:05:35,833
Fine.

683
01:05:36,875 --> 01:05:38,083
Let's leave it to court then.

684
01:05:39,833 --> 01:05:41,333
But for your information…

685
01:05:43,625 --> 01:05:46,000
we have a statement from your doctor.

686
01:05:47,291 --> 01:05:50,250
According to him, you fear…

687
01:05:52,333 --> 01:05:53,875
that you have hurt Nusrat.

688
01:05:55,500 --> 01:05:56,625
You are a smart lawyer.

689
01:05:57,541 --> 01:06:01,208
You can imagine
the jury's reaction over this statement.

690
01:06:22,875 --> 01:06:25,958
That morning,
I had seen Hamid and Nusrat together.

691
01:06:27,541 --> 01:06:29,500
- They were together, so...
- Mira, please.

692
01:06:30,875 --> 01:06:33,541
Your affair stories
can distract Anand, not me.

693
01:06:35,916 --> 01:06:37,833
Ma'am. You need to take this.

694
01:06:40,291 --> 01:06:41,875
Excuse me. Hello?

695
01:06:51,166 --> 01:06:53,166
Nusrat's autopsy report is ready.

696
01:06:53,833 --> 01:06:54,833
She was…

697
01:06:57,041 --> 01:06:58,875
pregnant when she was murdered.

698
01:06:58,958 --> 01:07:01,625
We also found
your blood samples at the crime scene.

699
01:07:04,125 --> 01:07:07,750
Ms. Mira Kapoor, you'll need
to come with me to the police station.

700
01:07:24,708 --> 01:07:26,166
Can I take my medicines?

701
01:07:48,958 --> 01:07:49,958
Check on her.

702
01:08:36,291 --> 01:08:37,333
No!

703
01:09:14,458 --> 01:09:15,458
Excuse me.

704
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,833
I literally try to make that
swish sound. I see you, bob.

705
01:09:26,916 --> 01:09:28,166
It is what it is.

706
01:09:29,541 --> 01:09:30,875
Hold on. Hold on a second.

707
01:09:33,458 --> 01:09:34,833
- Hi.
- What happened to you?

708
01:09:35,625 --> 01:09:36,833
I need your help.

709
01:09:37,583 --> 01:09:39,541
Anything. Just… say the word.

710
01:09:40,250 --> 01:09:41,458
I need a phone,

711
01:09:42,250 --> 01:09:43,375
I need cash.

712
01:09:45,583 --> 01:09:46,583
And…

713
01:09:49,208 --> 01:09:51,083
Gun. I need a gun.

714
01:10:11,500 --> 01:10:12,500
Hey, Doc.

715
01:10:13,333 --> 01:10:15,666
Who are you? What do you want?

716
01:10:16,416 --> 01:10:19,458
Who I am doesn't matter.

717
01:10:19,541 --> 01:10:23,000
- Look, if you want money, it's in the bag.
- I want the truth.

718
01:10:25,375 --> 01:10:26,750
Nusrat was pregnant.

719
01:10:28,416 --> 01:10:29,958
Did you know that?

720
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:37,500
Did you know that Nusrat was pregnant?

721
01:10:37,583 --> 01:10:40,000
- I don't know.
- Don't lie.

722
01:10:40,083 --> 01:10:42,250
I had seen you two together.

723
01:10:44,666 --> 01:10:47,916
- Were you having an affair with her?
- You're mistaken.

724
01:10:48,791 --> 01:10:51,625
- I am anyway going to prison.
- Okay.

725
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:54,666
Nusrat had asked me to come over.

726
01:11:26,041 --> 01:11:27,583
I want to meet you right away.

727
01:11:28,291 --> 01:11:29,625
Can you come over, please?

728
01:11:36,541 --> 01:11:37,916
I want to keep this child.

729
01:11:44,833 --> 01:11:46,000
I am scared.

730
01:11:52,750 --> 01:11:53,750
Why?

731
01:12:26,166 --> 01:12:27,541
Anand is not the father.

732
01:12:30,791 --> 01:12:31,791
What?

733
01:12:40,625 --> 01:12:41,625
So who?

734
01:12:42,333 --> 01:12:44,791
Who is the father?

735
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:50,958
I tried to find out,

736
01:12:52,666 --> 01:12:54,000
but she didn't tell me.

737
01:12:55,583 --> 01:12:58,958
She kept trying to contact him.

738
01:13:00,875 --> 01:13:06,791
She was confident that
by the evening she will sort this out.

739
01:13:08,708 --> 01:13:09,791
But that very night…

740
01:13:12,250 --> 01:13:13,291
she was murdered.

741
01:13:15,083 --> 01:13:16,375
This means…

742
01:13:17,625 --> 01:13:20,541
she was going to meet him in the evening.

743
01:13:22,750 --> 01:13:23,875
So…

744
01:13:24,875 --> 01:13:26,916
he could also be the killer.

745
01:13:37,708 --> 01:13:38,750
What are you?

746
01:13:39,708 --> 01:13:41,000
A compulsive liar?

747
01:13:41,666 --> 01:13:44,750
I have amnesia. I don't remember things.

748
01:13:45,333 --> 01:13:47,000
Why should I believe you?

749
01:13:47,083 --> 01:13:52,750
Do you realize I have
enough evidence to send you to prison?

750
01:13:54,416 --> 01:13:55,500
6:00 to 11:00…

751
01:13:56,916 --> 01:13:58,625
you didn't meet your ex-husband.

752
01:13:59,708 --> 01:14:01,666
How did you spend these five hours?

753
01:15:38,458 --> 01:15:39,458
Hey.

754
01:15:40,500 --> 01:15:41,500
Hi.

755
01:15:42,833 --> 01:15:44,041
Can I ask you something?

756
01:15:45,166 --> 01:15:46,166
Yeah, sure.

757
01:15:48,583 --> 01:15:49,833
Have you seen this girl?

758
01:15:52,375 --> 01:15:53,458
Are you sure?

759
01:16:02,833 --> 01:16:03,916
Have you…

760
01:16:04,666 --> 01:16:06,208
seen me here before?

761
01:16:06,291 --> 01:16:08,333
What? No.

762
01:16:11,458 --> 01:16:13,791
Okay. Thank you.

763
01:16:18,500 --> 01:16:21,541
Ma'am, the hunt for Mira is on.
We still haven't found her.

764
01:16:22,291 --> 01:16:24,083
Go and talk to her friend Priya.

765
01:16:24,166 --> 01:16:27,416
- Ma'am, the data has been transferred.
- Good. Can I have the phone back?

766
01:16:27,500 --> 01:16:29,416
Yes, ma'am.
There is something you should see.

767
01:16:29,500 --> 01:16:30,833
What?

768
01:16:30,916 --> 01:16:33,541
A call came through to Mira
the same day she escaped.

769
01:16:34,875 --> 01:16:35,708
So?

770
01:16:35,791 --> 01:16:38,916
Later that day, a text message
came through from the same number,

771
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:40,708
asking Mira to get money.

772
01:16:41,291 --> 01:16:42,583
Was it an extortion call?

773
01:16:43,958 --> 01:16:44,958
What?

774
01:16:49,291 --> 01:16:51,875
Can you trace this number for me, please?

775
01:16:51,958 --> 01:16:54,375
And give me the phone back. Yeah?

776
01:16:54,458 --> 01:16:55,625
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yeah.

777
01:17:22,916 --> 01:17:24,666
Hi, this isn't working. Please.

778
01:17:29,333 --> 01:17:31,958
Sorry, ma'am, I'm afraid
your card is out of balance.

779
01:17:32,041 --> 01:17:37,166
Your last journey was between
High Road and Redbridge at 8:30 p.m.

780
01:17:37,250 --> 01:17:39,250
- Sorry. Can you top it up, please?
- Yeah, sure.

781
01:17:39,958 --> 01:17:40,958
Here.

782
01:17:48,916 --> 01:17:49,916
Thank you.

783
01:17:59,208 --> 01:18:01,875
What time did you say
I took the last train?

784
01:18:01,958 --> 01:18:03,708
8:30 p.m., on 31st.

785
01:18:05,708 --> 01:18:06,875
From High Road?

786
01:18:07,625 --> 01:18:08,791
To Redbridge.

787
01:18:18,625 --> 01:18:19,625
Hello?

788
01:18:19,666 --> 01:18:23,666
Ma'am, Mira Kapoor was spotted
at Paddington Station an hour ago.

789
01:18:23,750 --> 01:18:24,833
What?

790
01:18:24,916 --> 01:18:28,083
Yes, ma'am. We're talking
to the people who saw her there.

791
01:18:30,250 --> 01:18:31,416
Yeah, I am on my way.

792
01:18:37,583 --> 01:18:39,625
Yeah. I'm sure it was her.
She's got this height.

793
01:18:39,708 --> 01:18:42,291
She had, like, a wound on her head. Yeah.

794
01:18:43,833 --> 01:18:45,458
It was quite deep. She ran this way.

795
01:18:45,541 --> 01:18:49,291
Dear friends,
welcome to this house of prayer.

796
01:18:49,375 --> 01:18:53,833
We've gathered together today
to remember our dear friend Nusrat.

797
01:18:54,666 --> 01:18:59,541
This is, for all of us,
a moment of great sadness.

798
01:19:00,208 --> 01:19:04,500
And yet,
there are so many wonderful memories

799
01:19:04,583 --> 01:19:09,250
that we want to recall now
and that we want to treasure.

800
01:19:11,541 --> 01:19:14,833
And so, in a moment of silence,

801
01:19:14,916 --> 01:19:19,458
let us bow our heads,
remember her, and pray.

802
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:27,833
- Amen.
- Amen.

803
01:20:13,666 --> 01:20:14,666
You.

804
01:20:15,833 --> 01:20:17,833
- Where's your phone?
- Why?

805
01:20:18,750 --> 01:20:20,375
Where's your phone? Show me your phone.

806
01:20:23,625 --> 01:20:26,000
- That is not your phone.
- It is my phone.

807
01:20:26,083 --> 01:20:28,166
You've stolen this phone.
That is not your phone.

808
01:20:28,250 --> 01:20:30,708
- What are you talking about? This is...
- Hand it over.

809
01:20:30,791 --> 01:20:32,625
- No.
- Hand it over.

810
01:20:32,708 --> 01:20:34,458
Should I call the cops?

811
01:20:34,541 --> 01:20:37,333
Give me the phone and the SIM card. Now.

812
01:20:45,041 --> 01:20:46,641
- It's good to see you.
- It's beautiful.

813
01:20:46,666 --> 01:20:48,375
Shame you couldn't come to our party.

814
01:20:48,458 --> 01:20:50,000
- Yeah.
- It would have been great.

815
01:20:50,083 --> 01:20:51,750
I hope you can make it next time.

816
01:20:53,708 --> 01:20:56,583
- Cheers then. Bye, take care.
- Take care, bye.

817
01:20:57,500 --> 01:20:58,916
It was nice seeing her. I know.

818
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:01,875
She couldn't even come
to the party yesterday.

819
01:21:01,958 --> 01:21:03,708
- That would have been great.
- Zehra.

820
01:21:03,791 --> 01:21:07,625
Mira, where have you been?
I haven't seen you in a million years.

821
01:21:08,625 --> 01:21:12,750
I tried contacting you so many times.
We were worried about you.

822
01:21:14,916 --> 01:21:17,875
After the party fiasco,

823
01:21:17,958 --> 01:21:21,416
I wanted to call you but…

824
01:21:23,375 --> 01:21:25,916
Shekhar suggested that I stay away.

825
01:21:26,500 --> 01:21:27,583
For what?

826
01:21:28,583 --> 01:21:31,958
- Shekhar told me that…
- What?

827
01:21:32,041 --> 01:21:35,916
…I said terrible things
about your furniture.

828
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,958
- What?
- I screamed and yelled at you.

829
01:21:38,041 --> 01:21:40,708
- I insulted you. I am...
- No.

830
01:21:40,791 --> 01:21:43,375
I'm really sorry.
I'm really sorry for that.

831
01:21:43,458 --> 01:21:45,541
Mira, are you all right?

832
01:21:45,625 --> 01:21:48,000
Because no such thing happened.

833
01:21:48,083 --> 01:21:49,708
No such thing happened.

834
01:21:49,791 --> 01:21:55,750
No, Shekhar said that I broke
some bottles and glasses,

835
01:21:55,833 --> 01:21:59,083
and I embarrassed you guys.

836
01:21:59,166 --> 01:22:03,416
And because of my behavior,
you fired Shekhar from his job.

837
01:22:04,541 --> 01:22:06,333
Really? That's rubbish.

838
01:22:07,166 --> 01:22:08,833
You were feeling pukish,

839
01:22:08,916 --> 01:22:11,458
so we let you rest in our study room.

840
01:22:12,750 --> 01:22:13,750
You okay?

841
01:22:15,375 --> 01:22:16,458
Lie down.

842
01:22:20,625 --> 01:22:21,625
Okay?

843
01:22:23,583 --> 01:22:24,750
She'll be fine.

844
01:22:29,166 --> 01:22:30,333
Hi. Have fun.

845
01:22:32,791 --> 01:22:33,791
That's it.

846
01:22:34,750 --> 01:22:36,916
And then you guys left.

847
01:22:38,083 --> 01:22:40,666
Sorry, Shekhar. Shekhar, sorry.

848
01:22:41,583 --> 01:22:43,583
Sorry? You're sorry?

849
01:22:44,791 --> 01:22:45,791
You're sorry?

850
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:50,750
First drama, then sorry.
Create a scene and then apologize.

851
01:22:50,833 --> 01:22:53,208
Look at me. Look at me!

852
01:22:55,416 --> 01:22:56,666
Look at yourself.

853
01:22:57,416 --> 01:22:59,416
You cannot even stand properly.

854
01:22:59,500 --> 01:23:02,500
You are so disgusting.

855
01:23:25,083 --> 01:23:27,875
We would've remembered
if something like that had happened.

856
01:23:30,166 --> 01:23:31,166
No.

857
01:23:33,375 --> 01:23:37,041
Then why did you fire him?

858
01:23:42,958 --> 01:23:43,791
Tell me.

859
01:23:43,875 --> 01:23:46,833
Because he was
harassing a female employee,

860
01:23:46,916 --> 01:23:51,541
and we didn't want to file a complaint
because Shekhar is an old friend.

861
01:23:51,625 --> 01:23:55,125
Trust me. You did nothing wrong.

862
01:23:55,208 --> 01:23:57,958
Good that you left him.

863
01:23:58,041 --> 01:24:00,500
You cannot trust him
when it comes to women.

864
01:24:05,458 --> 01:24:06,958
Are you okay, Mira?

865
01:24:19,750 --> 01:24:23,583
Who told you that pregnancy
would be risky after the accident?

866
01:24:23,666 --> 01:24:28,166
I told Shekhar very clearly,
everything is absolutely normal.

867
01:24:28,250 --> 01:24:31,916
There would be
no complications during pregnancy.

868
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:35,291
But he said you don't want kids anymore.

869
01:24:35,375 --> 01:24:36,500
Take care.

870
01:24:36,625 --> 01:24:40,250
We could try again.

871
01:24:42,208 --> 01:24:44,208
- This time I'll...
- Mira.

872
01:24:45,500 --> 01:24:47,208
I just met your gynecologist.

873
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:50,916
She said there are many complications.

874
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:52,708
You're medically still not fit for it.

875
01:24:52,791 --> 01:24:55,291
Why in these walls

876
01:24:55,375 --> 01:24:57,666
Have cracks started showing up

877
01:24:57,750 --> 01:25:03,083
There has to be a reason

878
01:25:03,166 --> 01:25:05,583
The distance suggests

879
01:25:05,666 --> 01:25:12,291
The sea has drowned every shore

880
01:25:14,041 --> 01:25:19,125
Pain lies awake in my sleepy eyes

881
01:25:19,208 --> 01:25:23,375
I feel shattered
Trying to keep everything together

882
01:25:23,458 --> 01:25:29,458
I feel defeated

883
01:25:29,541 --> 01:25:33,416
You were so selfish, my love

884
01:25:34,416 --> 01:25:37,250
I feel defeated

885
01:25:37,333 --> 01:25:41,375
You were so selfish, my love

886
01:25:42,250 --> 01:25:45,250
I feel defeated

887
01:25:45,333 --> 01:25:50,166
You were so selfish, my love…

888
01:25:50,291 --> 01:25:53,250
Congratulations
to the new head of cardiology.

889
01:25:55,416 --> 01:25:56,541
Drink some more.

890
01:25:56,625 --> 01:25:58,375
- No.
- Come on, drink some more.

891
01:25:58,458 --> 01:25:59,500
I'm going to sleep.

892
01:25:59,583 --> 01:26:02,083
Sit down and drink.

893
01:26:12,041 --> 01:26:13,083
What happened?

894
01:26:14,666 --> 01:26:15,958
How did you get hurt?

895
01:26:16,041 --> 01:26:18,166
I tried to stop you
after your fourth drink.

896
01:26:19,125 --> 01:26:21,541
- You hit me with a corkscrew.
- Shit.

897
01:26:22,666 --> 01:26:24,250
Shit, I'm so sorry.

898
01:26:35,583 --> 01:26:39,666
Did you hear me?
I want these papers signed by tomorrow.

899
01:26:43,208 --> 01:26:44,208
Shekhar.

900
01:26:44,833 --> 01:26:46,791
- Shekhar, I'm really sorry.
- Mira!

901
01:26:46,875 --> 01:26:50,333
Shekhar, I'm sorry.
I'll make everything okay.

902
01:26:50,416 --> 01:26:52,256
- Sign the papers.
- I'll make everything okay.

903
01:26:52,291 --> 01:26:55,250
- Mira, just sign the divorce papers.
- I can't sign them, please.

904
01:26:55,333 --> 01:26:57,093
- I said sign the papers!
- Give me a chance.

905
01:26:57,125 --> 01:26:58,166
Just sign the papers!

906
01:26:58,958 --> 01:27:01,416
Your love was a lie

907
01:27:01,500 --> 01:27:03,750
Your claims were a lie

908
01:27:03,833 --> 01:27:09,333
Losing our hearts to each other
Was also a lie

909
01:27:09,416 --> 01:27:11,958
Your love was a lie

910
01:27:12,041 --> 01:27:14,541
Your claims were a lie

911
01:27:14,625 --> 01:27:20,166
Losing our hearts to each other
Was also a lie

912
01:27:29,791 --> 01:27:31,750
My love

913
01:27:37,833 --> 01:27:40,583
I feel defeated

914
01:27:40,666 --> 01:27:44,500
You were so selfish, my love

915
01:27:53,416 --> 01:27:56,458
My love

916
01:27:56,541 --> 01:28:00,250
You were so selfish, my love

917
01:28:33,541 --> 01:28:36,250
I feel so trapped
in this marriage with Anand.

918
01:28:37,666 --> 01:28:39,958
He's become aggressive… again.

919
01:28:43,583 --> 01:28:46,750
I really don't know how
you deal with this. I swear to God.

920
01:28:47,833 --> 01:28:50,916
I felt so dead inside
before you came into my life.

921
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,333
You've given me a purpose to live again.

922
01:28:53,416 --> 01:28:56,250
Your kisses and hugs, they've set me free.

923
01:28:56,333 --> 01:28:57,625
I feel the same way.

924
01:28:58,583 --> 01:29:01,333
You are like
this breath of fresh air for me.

925
01:29:02,250 --> 01:29:04,208
I can't wait to meet you
in the forest today.

926
01:29:05,250 --> 01:29:09,666
Gonna pin you down to the backseat
of my car and really make love to you.

927
01:29:11,083 --> 01:29:12,708
And I am dying for it.

928
01:29:12,791 --> 01:29:15,500
I am dying to kiss
those beautiful lips of yours.

929
01:29:16,208 --> 01:29:17,541
Walter is blackmailing me.

930
01:29:17,625 --> 01:29:21,250
If we don't give him the money,
he'll take the photos to Anand.

931
01:29:44,666 --> 01:29:46,500
This is the footage
from last Thursday night.

932
01:29:46,583 --> 01:29:48,041
That's me, right there.

933
01:29:48,125 --> 01:29:50,666
Yeah, but that's 8:30 p.m., not 10:30 p.m.

934
01:29:51,375 --> 01:29:53,333
Did you give this footage to anyone else?

935
01:29:53,416 --> 01:29:55,416
No, but maybe the night-shift guy did.

936
01:29:57,041 --> 01:29:58,041
Talk to him.

937
01:29:58,125 --> 01:30:02,375
Just find out if anybody else had
access to this room in the last few days.

938
01:30:02,458 --> 01:30:03,750
That's gonna take more time.

939
01:30:04,500 --> 01:30:05,791
And more time means…

940
01:30:05,875 --> 01:30:07,208
More money, I know.

941
01:30:07,291 --> 01:30:09,708
Just take all the money you want.

942
01:30:09,791 --> 01:30:12,958
Just take it all. Just call him, please.
Please, can you find out?

943
01:30:56,916 --> 01:30:58,916
Oh, my God!

944
01:31:08,375 --> 01:31:09,416
My house…

945
01:31:10,208 --> 01:31:11,208
What?

946
01:31:29,583 --> 01:31:31,875
How many times have I told you
not to call on this number?

947
01:31:31,958 --> 01:31:33,958
Anand, Walter is dead.

948
01:31:34,041 --> 01:31:36,416
What? Who is this?

949
01:31:36,500 --> 01:31:41,000
- Mira.
- Mira? Why do you have Walter's phone?

950
01:31:41,083 --> 01:31:45,083
I don't have much time.
I need Walter's address.

951
01:31:45,166 --> 01:31:48,958
- Why? Who killed Walter?
- Don't waste my time.

952
01:31:49,041 --> 01:31:50,416
Cops are after me.

953
01:31:50,500 --> 01:31:53,416
I don't know about Walter,
but I think I know who killed Nusrat.

954
01:31:53,500 --> 01:31:55,791
Please, I need Walter's address.

955
01:31:57,833 --> 01:32:02,166
Or else, I'll have to tell the cops
that you had a PI following Nusrat.

956
01:32:03,166 --> 01:32:04,250
Send it.

957
01:32:04,333 --> 01:32:06,458
Okay, I will.

958
01:35:13,750 --> 01:35:15,458
What are you doing here?

959
01:35:15,541 --> 01:35:17,833
I told you not to meddle!

960
01:35:20,666 --> 01:35:23,083
You are like that unwanted dog

961
01:35:23,166 --> 01:35:27,125
that keeps following you no matter
how many times you kick it away.

962
01:35:30,458 --> 01:35:31,583
What do I do with you?

963
01:35:32,875 --> 01:35:35,708
No matter what I do, you are
anyway going to forget it by tomorrow.

964
01:35:40,583 --> 01:35:41,583
You want me?

965
01:35:43,416 --> 01:35:48,708
You want me.

966
01:36:12,458 --> 01:36:16,625
Mira. What do you want?
Why can't you just leave us alone?

967
01:36:16,708 --> 01:36:19,375
Shekhar, what the hell is this?

968
01:36:19,458 --> 01:36:21,625
Put some sense into that crazy woman.

969
01:36:21,708 --> 01:36:23,250
You said she won't be calling anymore.

970
01:36:24,083 --> 01:36:25,541
Why is she still calling you?

971
01:36:26,833 --> 01:36:28,041
I'll just check it.

972
01:36:28,791 --> 01:36:29,625
Hello?

973
01:36:29,708 --> 01:36:32,583
So you've saved
Nusrat's number under my name.

974
01:36:33,416 --> 01:36:34,833
It's over, Shekhar.

975
01:36:34,916 --> 01:36:36,958
There's no escaping this.

976
01:36:39,458 --> 01:36:40,500
What nonsense.

977
01:36:42,791 --> 01:36:44,375
How did you get Nusrat's phone?

978
01:36:45,166 --> 01:36:51,208
Your DNA will confirm
that you fathered Nusrat's child.

979
01:36:57,500 --> 01:36:59,166
You have 30 minutes.

980
01:36:59,250 --> 01:37:01,458
Come and meet me.

981
01:38:05,666 --> 01:38:06,833
Take a good look at them.

982
01:38:13,291 --> 01:38:14,791
- Nusrat's phone...
- Don't move.

983
01:38:20,666 --> 01:38:22,083
Where's Nusrat's phone?

984
01:38:22,166 --> 01:38:23,791
Step back, Shekhar.

985
01:38:28,541 --> 01:38:31,458
Okay.

986
01:38:32,708 --> 01:38:33,791
Talk.

987
01:38:36,541 --> 01:38:37,666
I remember.

988
01:38:39,500 --> 01:38:40,750
I remember everything.

989
01:38:42,375 --> 01:38:47,250
All those terrible things
that you said I had done…

990
01:38:48,833 --> 01:38:50,541
were actually done by you.

991
01:38:52,458 --> 01:38:56,208
I saw you in the forest that night.

992
01:38:59,541 --> 01:39:01,125
You killed Nusrat.

993
01:39:02,708 --> 01:39:04,291
What are you saying, Mira?

994
01:39:05,208 --> 01:39:06,791
Why would I kill Nusrat?

995
01:39:06,875 --> 01:39:08,583
- I have proof.
- Yeah?

996
01:39:08,666 --> 01:39:09,833
Tell me everything.

997
01:39:10,583 --> 01:39:13,208
Or else when the police
go looking for you tomorrow…

998
01:39:15,166 --> 01:39:17,250
they won't even find a body this time.

999
01:39:17,333 --> 01:39:20,291
You killed Nusrat. Tell me.

1000
01:39:29,041 --> 01:39:30,791
We need to talk.

1001
01:39:31,375 --> 01:39:32,583
Not now. Later.

1002
01:39:34,166 --> 01:39:36,333
Later, when? You'll meet in the evening?

1003
01:39:41,166 --> 01:39:42,458
Please.

1004
01:39:42,541 --> 01:39:44,875
Nusrat and I, we were having an affair.

1005
01:39:44,958 --> 01:39:45,958
Okay.

1006
01:39:46,833 --> 01:39:49,208
We were going to meet
in the forest like always.

1007
01:39:50,583 --> 01:39:52,375
But that day, you followed her.

1008
01:39:52,458 --> 01:39:53,458
Hey!

1009
01:39:54,166 --> 01:39:56,000
Why were you following her?

1010
01:39:57,583 --> 01:39:59,583
I had to bloody deal with you.

1011
01:40:01,833 --> 01:40:03,125
When I came back…

1012
01:40:05,458 --> 01:40:06,833
Nusrat surprised me.

1013
01:40:06,916 --> 01:40:07,916
I'm pregnant.

1014
01:40:14,750 --> 01:40:16,958
She told me she's pregnant,
and I asked her to abort.

1015
01:40:17,041 --> 01:40:21,000
I'll divorce Anand, like we had decided,

1016
01:40:22,041 --> 01:40:23,125
to start a family.

1017
01:40:23,791 --> 01:40:28,000
I don't want a child.

1018
01:40:29,750 --> 01:40:33,000
Especially not with you.

1019
01:40:33,583 --> 01:40:34,750
But she wouldn't listen.

1020
01:40:34,875 --> 01:40:36,250
I was leaving.

1021
01:40:36,333 --> 01:40:38,708
I was leaving her,
I was going away, but she kept talking.

1022
01:40:38,791 --> 01:40:40,416
She kept talking. She wouldn't stop.

1023
01:40:40,500 --> 01:40:42,208
I'll tell everyone that this is your baby.

1024
01:40:42,291 --> 01:40:44,375
I'll tell everyone
that you sexually exploited me.

1025
01:40:44,458 --> 01:40:45,625
You will rot in jail!

1026
01:40:45,708 --> 01:40:47,916
She kept on talking.
I didn't want to listen.

1027
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:52,083
I didn't want to listen to her,
but she kept talking. And then she said…

1028
01:40:52,166 --> 01:40:55,583
You used me.
You used Mira. You used Anjali.

1029
01:40:55,666 --> 01:40:57,625
Problem is with you, you sicko!

1030
01:40:58,208 --> 01:40:59,833
That's the moment, I grabbed her.

1031
01:41:00,750 --> 01:41:02,000
I was choking her to death.

1032
01:41:02,625 --> 01:41:06,041
And I could see her breath
just disappearing away.

1033
01:41:11,541 --> 01:41:12,916
She looked so beautiful.

1034
01:41:13,708 --> 01:41:15,875
I… I just wanted to kiss her.

1035
01:41:16,666 --> 01:41:18,500
I couldn't stop myself.

1036
01:41:18,583 --> 01:41:20,500
I kept going closer to her, but…

1037
01:41:29,541 --> 01:41:30,708
She collapsed.

1038
01:41:44,208 --> 01:41:46,333
You don't need to be scared of me, Mira.

1039
01:41:46,416 --> 01:41:47,958
I won't kill you.

1040
01:41:49,750 --> 01:41:51,166
I've always loved you.

1041
01:41:52,291 --> 01:41:53,916
I've got something for you.

1042
01:41:57,833 --> 01:41:58,958
Let's have a drink.

1043
01:41:59,791 --> 01:42:01,125
Yeah? Just you and I...

1044
01:42:01,208 --> 01:42:02,541
Stay back, Shekhar.

1045
01:42:08,041 --> 01:42:09,041
Okay.

1046
01:42:16,125 --> 01:42:17,500
Just one drink.

1047
01:42:21,125 --> 01:42:22,125
See.

1048
01:42:23,541 --> 01:42:24,791
I am sitting here.

1049
01:42:24,875 --> 01:42:26,291
I am going to sit here.

1050
01:42:26,375 --> 01:42:28,250
Think over it. Yeah?

1051
01:42:30,875 --> 01:42:31,875
One drink.

1052
01:42:35,458 --> 01:42:36,458
Come on.

1053
01:42:48,875 --> 01:42:50,083
When did you change, Shekhar?

1054
01:42:57,250 --> 01:42:58,791
You're not the Shekhar…

1055
01:43:00,208 --> 01:43:01,833
I fell in love with.

1056
01:43:07,291 --> 01:43:08,500
Or perhaps…

1057
01:43:09,750 --> 01:43:11,333
you've always been like this.

1058
01:43:14,875 --> 01:43:18,708
But I was too blindly in love to see this.

1059
01:43:31,041 --> 01:43:32,791
So you want your life back.

1060
01:43:34,666 --> 01:43:36,291
You want Nusrat's phone back.

1061
01:43:49,125 --> 01:43:50,125
Take it.

1062
01:43:51,208 --> 01:43:52,208
Mira…

1063
01:43:53,416 --> 01:43:56,875
Mira, I love you. I love you, Mira.

1064
01:44:38,916 --> 01:44:40,541
Then who killed Walter?

1065
01:44:44,958 --> 01:44:46,875
The black car.

1066
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:34,875
So you finally know the truth.

1067
01:47:38,625 --> 01:47:39,916
But what's the point?

1068
01:47:40,833 --> 01:47:41,833
Too late.

1069
01:47:43,791 --> 01:47:45,041
You were trying…

1070
01:47:46,458 --> 01:47:47,666
to frame me.

1071
01:47:48,958 --> 01:47:49,791
Why?

1072
01:47:49,875 --> 01:47:52,625
Why do you think I did this?

1073
01:47:59,500 --> 01:48:02,208
Jimmy Bagga was your father.

1074
01:48:03,125 --> 01:48:04,416
Because of you,

1075
01:48:04,500 --> 01:48:05,541
my father…

1076
01:48:06,375 --> 01:48:08,250
committed suicide in prison.

1077
01:48:11,500 --> 01:48:14,500
You are the one who sent him to prison.

1078
01:48:15,583 --> 01:48:20,416
Your father was a criminal
convicted by the court.

1079
01:48:22,541 --> 01:48:24,208
I just did my job.

1080
01:48:26,208 --> 01:48:30,041
The truth isn't always
what it seems to be, Mira.

1081
01:48:34,375 --> 01:48:36,250
I knew my father.

1082
01:48:37,541 --> 01:48:39,166
He could have never done such a thing.

1083
01:48:39,250 --> 01:48:45,500
And no law, court,
or judgment can change my belief.

1084
01:48:49,375 --> 01:48:51,541
You… were wrong.

1085
01:48:56,583 --> 01:48:57,958
That is what you think.

1086
01:49:01,958 --> 01:49:03,416
Because of you…

1087
01:49:05,458 --> 01:49:06,583
I lost my child.

1088
01:49:11,458 --> 01:49:13,375
You deserved more pain.

1089
01:49:15,458 --> 01:49:19,708
That's why I started shadowing you
after I saw you at the station.

1090
01:49:21,916 --> 01:49:24,625
That day, I followed you into the forest.

1091
01:49:25,166 --> 01:49:27,166
Shekhar and Nusrat were also there.

1092
01:49:27,916 --> 01:49:29,291
They were fighting.

1093
01:49:30,541 --> 01:49:33,958
Then Shekhar took it too far,
and Nusrat collapsed.

1094
01:49:37,041 --> 01:49:38,875
Shekhar got scared and left.

1095
01:49:43,458 --> 01:49:44,791
You were lying unconscious.

1096
01:49:46,875 --> 01:49:48,666
Shekhar hadn't killed Nusrat.

1097
01:49:48,750 --> 01:49:50,083
She was just unconscious.

1098
01:49:51,916 --> 01:49:53,291
When I saw you lying there,

1099
01:49:54,666 --> 01:49:57,333
I wanted to strangle you to death,

1100
01:49:59,708 --> 01:50:00,958
but I was unlucky.

1101
01:50:01,958 --> 01:50:05,416
Nusrat decided to show up right then.

1102
01:50:05,500 --> 01:50:08,458
Nusrat saw me strangling you.

1103
01:50:09,250 --> 01:50:12,833
And before she could expose me,
I had to get rid of her.

1104
01:50:14,916 --> 01:50:16,833
You left as soon as
you regained consciousness.

1105
01:50:23,875 --> 01:50:28,375
So you changed the timing of
the High Road station's CCTV footage.

1106
01:50:33,375 --> 01:50:36,875
And the person
I saw from the train, chasing Nusrat…

1107
01:50:39,958 --> 01:50:41,291
it was you.

1108
01:50:43,500 --> 01:50:45,708
She was the best opportunity…

1109
01:50:46,375 --> 01:50:47,458
to set you up.

1110
01:51:00,666 --> 01:51:01,666
Set me up?

1111
01:51:08,500 --> 01:51:14,625
I figured out
that Walter's killer had my phone,

1112
01:51:16,208 --> 01:51:18,958
because the killer knew about our meeting.

1113
01:51:21,500 --> 01:51:22,541
So I…

1114
01:51:23,875 --> 01:51:29,333
sent another message
to my phone from Walter's phone.

1115
01:51:39,083 --> 01:51:40,166
And see…

1116
01:51:41,208 --> 01:51:42,708
you read the message.

1117
01:51:46,083 --> 01:51:48,041
Dalbir Kaur Bagga…

1118
01:51:51,166 --> 01:51:54,083
I am the one who brought you here.

1119
01:52:40,583 --> 01:52:45,625
Our love was flawed

1120
01:52:47,041 --> 01:52:52,375
All I got was a bad name

1121
01:52:59,666 --> 01:53:04,458
Our love was flawed

1122
01:53:06,041 --> 01:53:11,083
All I got was a bad name

1123
01:53:12,458 --> 01:53:18,541
My wandering heart faced

1124
01:53:18,625 --> 01:53:23,541
Failure at every step

1125
01:53:24,833 --> 01:53:30,916
All my dreams shattered
Right before my eyes

1126
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:36,583
I feel shattered
Trying to keep everything together

1127
01:53:36,666 --> 01:53:43,250
I feel defeated

1128
01:53:43,958 --> 01:53:49,583
You were so selfish, my love

1129
01:53:49,666 --> 01:53:53,166
My love

1130
01:53:53,250 --> 01:53:58,458
You were so selfish, my love

1131
01:53:59,291 --> 01:54:02,750
I feel defeated

1132
01:54:02,833 --> 01:54:08,916
You were so selfish, my love

1133
01:54:12,166 --> 01:54:15,291
Your love was a lie

1134
01:54:15,375 --> 01:54:17,000
Your claims were a lie…

1135
01:54:17,083 --> 01:54:20,416
Today, I begin a new journey, a new train,

1136
01:54:21,458 --> 01:54:24,916
heading towards a new destination
with renewed hope.

1137
01:54:26,083 --> 01:54:29,458
It's a new life with a new beginning,

1138
01:54:30,458 --> 01:54:32,500
because I'm not the girl I used to be.

1139
01:54:33,916 --> 01:54:38,041
I am Mira Kapoor, and this is my story.

1140
01:54:43,916 --> 01:54:49,625
You were so selfish, my love

1141
01:54:49,750 --> 01:54:53,208
My love

1142
01:54:53,291 --> 01:54:58,541
You were so selfish, my love

1143
01:54:59,250 --> 01:55:02,708
I feel defeated

1144
01:55:02,791 --> 01:55:09,750
You were so selfish, my love

1145
01:55:36,916 --> 01:55:42,166
Monsoon cheated the clouds
The rain claims

1146
01:55:42,250 --> 01:55:47,541
I learned angry tears are not the same

1147
01:55:52,833 --> 01:55:58,125
Monsoon cheated the clouds
The rain claims

1148
01:55:58,208 --> 01:56:02,875
I learned angry tears are not the same

1149
01:56:02,958 --> 01:56:08,875
I don't know why doesn't God hear
The pleas of the hurting soul

1150
01:56:10,291 --> 01:56:15,375
I feel cheated, I feel mad

1151
01:56:15,458 --> 01:56:20,791
I feel burned, I feel like a sad fool

1152
01:56:20,875 --> 01:56:26,000
I feel cheated, I feel mad

1153
01:56:26,083 --> 01:56:31,375
I feel burned, I feel like a sad fool

1154
01:56:52,500 --> 01:56:54,916
I feel cheated

1155
01:56:57,791 --> 01:57:00,416
I feel burned

1156
01:57:02,666 --> 01:57:07,125
I waited for the moon during the day

1157
01:57:08,166 --> 01:57:12,708
I kept an earthen pot in the rain

1158
01:57:18,541 --> 01:57:23,083
I waited for the moon during the day

1159
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:28,958
I kept an earthen pot in the rain

1160
01:57:29,041 --> 01:57:34,666
Love makes even a smart one go crazy

1161
01:57:34,750 --> 01:57:39,958
I feel cheated, I feel mad

1162
01:57:40,041 --> 01:57:45,291
I feel burned, I feel like a sad fool

1163
01:58:07,208 --> 01:58:11,916
The deceitful bird
Has left the wind heartbroken

1164
01:58:12,833 --> 01:58:18,083
The peepal tree is withering away

1165
01:58:23,208 --> 01:58:28,500
The deceitful bird
Has left the wind heartbroken

1166
01:58:28,583 --> 01:58:33,583
The peepal tree is withering away

1167
01:58:33,666 --> 01:58:39,208
Only the one who hurts screams in pain

1168
01:58:39,291 --> 01:58:44,541
I feel cheated, I feel mad

1169
01:58:44,625 --> 01:58:49,791
I feel burned, I feel like a sad fool

1170
01:58:49,875 --> 01:58:55,041
I feel cheated, I feel mad

1171
01:58:55,125 --> 01:59:00,333
I feel cheated, I feel mad

1172
01:59:00,416 --> 01:59:05,875
I feel cheated, I feel mad

1173
01:59:26,833 --> 01:59:29,458
I feel cheated

1174
01:59:31,916 --> 01:59:34,666
I feel burned
