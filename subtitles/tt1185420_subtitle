resync for 720p: gperiklis

3
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,558
Hello (sris)?

4
00:06:17,635 --> 00:06:20,468
Sam! Where are you?!
- Mom!

5
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:23,270
Mom my foot! I've been
calling up the motel for a while.

6
00:06:23,344 --> 00:06:25,505
They said that you didn't
return since last night.

7
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:26,911
Chill, Mom!

8
00:06:26,982 --> 00:06:30,577
You have stopped obeying me
ever since your dad passed away.

9
00:06:30,654 --> 00:06:33,987
Mom, I was just two years
old when dad passed away.

10
00:06:34,058 --> 00:06:36,151
Shut up! Tell me where you are.

11
00:06:36,528 --> 00:06:37,586
I'm at my friend's place.

12
00:06:37,663 --> 00:06:38,925
Had you looked for a
house of your own..

13
00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:41,524
..you wouldn't have had to live
at a friend's place like this.

14
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:43,997
Who's this friend?

15
00:06:48,012 --> 00:06:49,206
A close friend, mom.

16
00:06:50,047 --> 00:06:52,948
It's your first day at work today.
Instead of fooling around..

17
00:06:53,019 --> 00:06:57,422
..with your friends, you should've
been praying all night.

18
00:06:57,491 --> 00:06:59,618
That's what I was
doing all night, mom.

19
00:06:59,694 --> 00:07:02,026
Okay. Okay. Don't forget
to call me tonight

20
00:07:02,197 --> 00:07:04,028
Okay, mom.
- Okay then, bye.

21
00:08:22,544 --> 00:08:24,136
Hey! Sam.

22
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,174
Hi, I'm Kunal.

23
00:08:26,349 --> 00:08:27,407
I know.

24
00:08:27,484 --> 00:08:28,542
How do you know?

25
00:08:34,393 --> 00:08:41,356
Oh Kunal! Oh Kunal!

26
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:44,235
Oh.. Kunal!

27
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:46,097
Before this, I hadn't
heard anybody's name..

28
00:08:46,177 --> 00:08:49,510
..so many times in one night.
I feel like I already know you.

29
00:08:50,716 --> 00:08:51,774
Thanks.

30
00:08:55,223 --> 00:08:57,487
I have to go. First day on the job.

31
00:08:58,427 --> 00:08:59,519
Wish you all the best!

32
00:09:00,464 --> 00:09:01,556
See you around.

33
00:09:01,731 --> 00:09:02,789
See you.

34
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:11,203
So you're actually a nurse?

35
00:09:12,481 --> 00:09:17,214
And you studied five years
to become one.. a nurse?

36
00:09:18,255 --> 00:09:21,156
But why?! I mean, you
could've studied the same..

37
00:09:21,226 --> 00:09:24,320
..and become a doctor. Why a nurse?

38
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:30,500
Nurse, I'm ready for my sponge bath.

39
00:09:59,513 --> 00:10:00,571
Hi, good looking!

40
00:10:00,648 --> 00:10:01,706
There's a bad news.

41
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:03,215
What? I have to come over to
your place again tonight..

42
00:10:03,285 --> 00:10:05,685
..for a creative meeting, right?

43
00:10:05,755 --> 00:10:08,223
Very funny! I hope
your sense of humour..

44
00:10:08,292 --> 00:10:10,317
..helps you to find a new house.

45
00:10:10,395 --> 00:10:11,453
Find a house?

46
00:10:12,431 --> 00:10:13,489
Oh! No. No.

47
00:10:13,566 --> 00:10:16,228
Oh yes! Yes. Yes, I've found
a new tenant and..

48
00:10:16,303 --> 00:10:19,431
..he's even paying me cash.

49
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:35,352
Taxi! Taxi, taxi. Come on, man!

50
00:10:35,863 --> 00:10:36,921
Taxi!

51
00:10:38,267 --> 00:10:39,325
Taxi!

52
00:10:41,338 --> 00:10:42,396
Taxi!

53
00:10:49,783 --> 00:10:51,444
Kunal?
- Sam, right?

54
00:10:51,518 --> 00:10:52,780
Right. Right.

55
00:10:52,854 --> 00:10:55,345
Look, dude I'm really sorry,
but I'm in a hurry.

56
00:10:55,491 --> 00:10:56,719
Why don't you get another cab?

57
00:10:57,361 --> 00:10:58,419
Okay.

58
00:11:01,366 --> 00:11:03,391
Wait a minute. Why should
I get another cab?

59
00:11:03,469 --> 00:11:04,527
I stopped this one first

60
00:11:04,604 --> 00:11:06,469
No, dude. I stopped this cab first.

61
00:11:06,774 --> 00:11:08,901
No, I stopped it first. It's my cab.

62
00:11:08,976 --> 00:11:10,307
No, dude. It's my cab.

63
00:11:10,379 --> 00:11:12,313
Hey, bro! This is my cab.
Do you guys want to tell me..

64
00:11:12,382 --> 00:11:13,644
..where you want to go
or do you want to get off?

65
00:11:15,653 --> 00:11:16,711
5th and Alpine..

66
00:11:52,771 --> 00:11:53,829
1 6 B.

67
00:11:54,441 --> 00:11:57,808
1 6th floor.
The elevators are that way.

68
00:12:03,486 --> 00:12:06,455
It's strange how we keep
bumping into each other

69
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:08,588
It's like fate

70
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:13,724
But what matters is who's
fated to get this house.

71
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:22,068
Come in.

72
00:12:43,442 --> 00:12:44,500
Wow!

73
00:12:57,462 --> 00:12:58,827
Hey! Why are you scaring me?

74
00:12:59,632 --> 00:13:00,690
Hey! You're lndian.

75
00:13:00,766 --> 00:13:02,063
No, I'm Chinese.

76
00:13:05,006 --> 00:13:06,064
Is this your house?

77
00:13:06,141 --> 00:13:07,836
No, it's the neighbours'.
Shall I call them?

78
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:10,037
No, no. We've come to
check out the house.

79
00:13:10,113 --> 00:13:13,207
Did you check it out?
Is it good? Now leave.

80
00:13:14,486 --> 00:13:16,477
What do you mean? - I mean,
didn't the agent tell you..

81
00:13:16,556 --> 00:13:17,648
..that 'baby'
lives alone over here.

82
00:13:19,893 --> 00:13:20,951
Baby?

83
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:22,988
Baby.

84
00:13:26,036 --> 00:13:27,094
Look, Baby..

85
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:30,765
Excuse me.
Men aren't allowed here.

86
00:13:30,842 --> 00:13:33,606
I want girls even in the
two vacant rooms here.

87
00:13:33,947 --> 00:13:37,178
After all, it's a question
of our security and honour.

88
00:13:37,751 --> 00:13:38,809
Did you hear that?

89
00:13:39,588 --> 00:13:46,585
Yes, security and honour.
But whose?

90
00:13:47,131 --> 00:13:49,099
No that.. there are two rooms..

91
00:13:51,004 --> 00:13:52,528
Sweet!

92
00:13:52,606 --> 00:13:54,870
You said sweet,
you're hitting on me.

93
00:13:54,942 --> 00:13:56,534
No..
- Get out! - No, no.. - Out!

94
00:13:56,612 --> 00:13:57,670
No..
- Out!

95
00:13:57,813 --> 00:13:59,610
Ma'am.. - Out! Out! Get out!
- No, wait. Wait..

96
00:13:59,682 --> 00:14:01,912
Out! Get out! Scoundrel!

97
00:14:03,555 --> 00:14:04,749
No boys, only girls.

98
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:07,622
Even we want that,
but not in that sense.

99
00:14:09,296 --> 00:14:10,820
Hey! Do you want a hot dog?
- Sure.

100
00:14:11,633 --> 00:14:14,124
So what else do you do other
than bumping into me everywhere?

101
00:14:14,303 --> 00:14:16,863
I work at Howard
Medical Centre. Two please!

102
00:14:17,941 --> 00:14:20,171
Oh doctor? That's cool!

103
00:14:20,244 --> 00:14:22,007
No, I'm actually a nurse.

104
00:14:22,981 --> 00:14:24,642
Do you also have to
wear a short skirt?

105
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,651
That's a very old one.

106
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:29,748
What do you do?

107
00:14:29,824 --> 00:14:30,882
I'm a photographer.

108
00:14:31,727 --> 00:14:35,254
Cool! So do you.. with
the models.. you know..

109
00:14:37,769 --> 00:14:39,999
Radical! When did
you come from lndia?

110
00:14:40,072 --> 00:14:41,130
Three years ago.

111
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:42,967
You've been looking for
a house for three years?

112
00:14:43,043 --> 00:14:46,672
I live at a friend's place.
But I have to vacate now.

113
00:14:46,748 --> 00:14:47,806
That too in two weeks.

114
00:14:49,819 --> 00:14:51,343
Tough luck, dude!
- Yes!

115
00:14:55,795 --> 00:14:56,853
Sir, are you okay?

116
00:14:56,929 --> 00:15:02,868
I'm fine. I'm fine. Really, I'm just..
it's just that my boyfriend..

117
00:15:02,937 --> 00:15:06,634
..has been sent to
lraq and I'm here and..

118
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:08,974
..we were so happy
after Afghanistan..

119
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,340
Everything was perfect.

120
00:15:10,716 --> 00:15:13,651
I mean, we were like the
perfect family and I just saw..

121
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,711
..the two of you standing
here and you look so happy.

122
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:18,314
My God! You just
reminded me so much of us.

123
00:15:18,393 --> 00:15:22,386
I mean, really. God
bless you both, I mean..

124
00:15:22,665 --> 00:15:26,066
I really wish you all
the happiness! - Thank you.

125
00:15:27,238 --> 00:15:28,296
Bye.

126
00:15:41,358 --> 00:15:42,757
Kunal.

127
00:15:42,826 --> 00:15:45,158
Are you crazy?!
- Listen to me. - Don't touch me!

128
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:48,893
Oh man! I'm not like that.
You're like my brother.

129
00:15:49,002 --> 00:15:51,698
I mean, you are my brother.
Albeit from another mother..

130
00:15:51,773 --> 00:15:52,831
..but you're my brother.

131
00:15:52,907 --> 00:15:54,772
Look, brother from another mother.

132
00:15:54,943 --> 00:15:57,241
You may be desperate, but I'm not.

133
00:15:57,714 --> 00:15:59,181
Do whatever you want to.

134
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,717
Come on buddy.
Had I been able to do it alone..

135
00:16:00,786 --> 00:16:01,844
..then I'd have done it.

136
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,785
But she won't believe my word alone.

137
00:16:04,891 --> 00:16:05,949
Listen to me.

138
00:16:06,026 --> 00:16:09,189
Look, even you agree that
the apartment is brilliant.

139
00:16:09,264 --> 00:16:11,027
Correct? Right.

140
00:16:12,468 --> 00:16:14,732
If we have to lie to an
old 'Baby' that we're gay..

141
00:16:14,805 --> 00:16:18,798
..in order to get that house,
then what difference does it make?

142
00:16:19,211 --> 00:16:23,045
It does make a difference.
I'm not gay.

143
00:16:23,117 --> 00:16:27,816
I know. I know this. You know this.

144
00:16:27,957 --> 00:16:30,755
And if you wish, I shall inform
every girl in Miami..

145
00:16:30,828 --> 00:16:33,991
..that you like girls.
We just won't tell Baby about it.

146
00:16:36,202 --> 00:16:40,832
Think about it. That
apartment has two rooms.

147
00:16:41,776 --> 00:16:42,936
The apartment is within our budget.

148
00:16:43,178 --> 00:16:45,942
And you're more desperate than me.

149
00:16:46,516 --> 00:16:50,418
I mean, you have a deadline
of two weeks. That's why..

150
00:16:52,023 --> 00:16:53,991
What do you say? Are you gay?

151
00:16:57,866 --> 00:16:59,857
You've come back!

152
00:16:59,934 --> 00:17:00,992
Baby!

153
00:17:01,971 --> 00:17:04,235
Are you taking advantage of
Baby just because she's alone

154
00:17:04,307 --> 00:17:07,105
No, no. No, you're
mistaken about us.

155
00:17:07,178 --> 00:17:08,236
What do you mean?

156
00:17:10,216 --> 00:17:11,274
Shall we come in and explain?

157
00:17:12,252 --> 00:17:13,549
Are you trying to be naughty?

158
00:17:14,221 --> 00:17:17,281
No, no. I'm taking permission.

159
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:21,991
Okay.

160
00:17:32,848 --> 00:17:33,974
What are you looking around for?

161
00:17:34,183 --> 00:17:35,582
Do you intend to steal?

162
00:17:36,853 --> 00:17:40,846
No, you're very funny. Actually
we should've told you earlier..

163
00:17:40,926 --> 00:17:43,520
..that we can rent this house.

164
00:17:43,596 --> 00:17:46,929
How can you rent it? I told you that
only girls are allowed.

165
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,299
We're both are girls.

166
00:17:54,444 --> 00:17:55,502
What?!

167
00:18:00,053 --> 00:18:03,887
Kunal and I are together.

168
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:05,152
Yes, I can see that.

169
00:18:05,627 --> 00:18:13,193
No, I mean we're with
each other.. you know..

170
00:18:13,271 --> 00:18:16,240
What are you saying?
I don't understand.

171
00:18:25,321 --> 00:18:30,054
Kunal is a special friend of mine.

172
00:18:34,433 --> 00:18:38,028
My most special friend.

173
00:18:39,274 --> 00:18:42,334
Yes, now I understand.
Today's friendship day.

174
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:44,209
Happy friendship day.
Happy friendship day.

175
00:18:44,281 --> 00:18:46,010
We're gay. He's my boyfriend.

176
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:47,141
Oh God! Oh, my God!

177
00:18:47,219 --> 00:18:48,618
Relax. Relax. Don't worry.

178
00:18:48,954 --> 00:18:51,582
Relax, sit down. Relax. Sit. Sit..

179
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,952
Relax, aunty. We're
telling you this..

180
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:58,022
..so that you think
carefully before deciding.

181
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:00,967
Exactly. And if there are two
girls staying here instead of us..

182
00:19:01,038 --> 00:19:03,472
..then just think about
what could possibly happen.

183
00:19:04,175 --> 00:19:05,972
They'd bring their
boyfriends here at night..

184
00:19:06,045 --> 00:19:12,075
..and then there would be parties,
cigarettes, booze, fooling around..

185
00:19:12,154 --> 00:19:13,212
Oh, my God!

186
00:19:13,288 --> 00:19:16,985
Yes. But if there
are two guys like us..

187
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:19,221
..then there's no
question of a third person..

188
00:19:19,463 --> 00:19:23,593
..because we're already
together and will always be.

189
00:19:24,337 --> 00:19:25,395
Isn't it, Kunal?

190
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:29,739
Moreover, as you said,
there's the security angle too.

191
00:19:30,145 --> 00:19:32,010
If two guys like us,
strong and fit..

192
00:19:32,082 --> 00:19:37,145
..stay with you, then you'll
have security too. Isn't it?

193
00:19:37,289 --> 00:19:40,747
Plus aunty, who pays
attention to age these days?

194
00:19:41,427 --> 00:19:44,191
You live alone in such a big house,
anything can happen..

195
00:19:44,532 --> 00:19:47,501
Why are you scaring me?
Anyway, I don't stay here.

196
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:49,093
Neha stays here.

197
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:50,496
Neha?

198
00:19:50,574 --> 00:19:52,542
Yes, my niece.

199
00:19:52,643 --> 00:19:54,133
Girl?!
- Sister's?!

200
00:19:56,115 --> 00:19:59,516
Sit quietly over here.
I'll be right back. - Okay.

201
00:20:06,062 --> 00:20:07,120
Dude..

202
00:20:09,401 --> 00:20:10,459
What's this twist in the story?

203
00:20:10,535 --> 00:20:12,503
Where did her sister's..
Neha crop up from?

204
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:15,801
Okay. I'm going.

205
00:20:16,076 --> 00:20:18,067
Going? Wait, sit down.
You talk about..

206
00:20:18,146 --> 00:20:20,808
..Leaving at the slightest.
Just wait. Let me think.

207
00:20:24,822 --> 00:20:28,087
Got it. Listen. I guess we'll have
to tell Neha the same thing that..

208
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,720
..we told aunty.

209
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:34,562
Are you crazy? One by one.

210
00:20:34,636 --> 00:20:37,298
Do you want to tell everybody
that we both are..

211
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:42,177
That we're gay.
Kunal, you're such a..

212
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:44,343
Think about it.

213
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:48,352
If the aunt is like this,
then how do you think Neha will be?

214
00:21:04,377 --> 00:21:08,814
If I had my way, then I'd say this to
aunty's entire family let alone Neha.

215
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:15,683
Hi.

216
00:21:39,727 --> 00:21:40,819
How can I help you?

217
00:21:40,895 --> 00:21:43,261
Neha dear, it's good that you came.

218
00:21:43,331 --> 00:21:45,492
These two boys have come
to check out the house.

219
00:21:47,271 --> 00:21:48,329
Aunty, they..

220
00:21:48,405 --> 00:21:50,930
I know they're boys.
Hey, tall guy! What's your name?

221
00:21:52,278 --> 00:21:53,336
Sameer.

222
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:54,811
And what's your name?

223
00:21:55,282 --> 00:21:57,580
Hi, I'm Kunal.

224
00:21:57,652 --> 00:21:58,710
Hi, Neha.

225
00:21:59,955 --> 00:22:04,358
Sameer, just a moment.
Could you excuse us? - Sure.

226
00:22:07,699 --> 00:22:08,757
Wow!

227
00:22:12,239 --> 00:22:14,799
Enough, let's go.

228
00:22:15,743 --> 00:22:16,835
What?! Why?!

229
00:22:16,912 --> 00:22:18,470
Aunty, how can I stay with two guys?

230
00:22:18,547 --> 00:22:22,745
Don't worry. They
both aren't what we are.

231
00:22:23,721 --> 00:22:25,245
What? Sindhi?

232
00:22:25,324 --> 00:22:29,920
Not Sindhi. They
both are modern boys.

233
00:22:29,997 --> 00:22:31,897
I can't pretend to be gay in
front of a girl like that.

234
00:22:31,967 --> 00:22:34,333
Okay, no problem. Don't be gay,
be homeless instead.

235
00:22:34,403 --> 00:22:36,803
No problem.
- They're boyfriend and girlfriend.

236
00:22:37,741 --> 00:22:38,833
Oh, gay!

237
00:22:39,444 --> 00:22:42,572
I won't stay in this house with
that girl, pretending to be gay.

238
00:22:42,748 --> 00:22:43,874
It's over. I'm going.

239
00:22:44,351 --> 00:22:47,752
Kunal, wait. Just wait. Calm down.

240
00:22:47,822 --> 00:22:50,290
It wasn't like this in
the old days. In our days..

241
00:22:50,359 --> 00:22:52,350
.. guys used to like girls.

242
00:22:52,428 --> 00:22:53,486
How sweet!

243
00:22:53,563 --> 00:22:54,962
Talk to Neha at least once.

244
00:22:55,032 --> 00:22:57,364
Who knows? Maybe only
the aunt requires girls!

245
00:22:57,502 --> 00:22:59,629
Yes, okay. I'm going.

246
00:22:59,705 --> 00:23:01,673
Kunal, just wait. Kunal..

247
00:23:03,377 --> 00:23:04,435
Hi!

248
00:23:05,313 --> 00:23:06,371
Nice room.

249
00:23:06,548 --> 00:23:08,982
Yes, I thought I'll
show you the room. - Sure.

250
00:23:09,052 --> 00:23:12,419
You've already seen this.
I hope you like it. - Sure.

251
00:23:12,823 --> 00:23:15,485
There are two rooms.
There's another one over there.

252
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,994
But there's only one bathroom.
It's connected.

253
00:23:19,333 --> 00:23:24,032
Wow! Actually, we both like
sharing bathrooms.

254
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:28,068
That way..

255
00:23:35,555 --> 00:23:36,613
Nice.

256
00:23:38,827 --> 00:23:39,885
Very nice.

257
00:23:42,565 --> 00:23:46,467
Sorry, this way.
So this is the bathroom.

258
00:23:47,972 --> 00:23:49,030
What's the rent?

259
00:23:49,375 --> 00:23:51,366
2,000 for each room.
But since you guys are the first..

260
00:23:51,445 --> 00:23:53,743
..you can decide
which one you want.

261
00:23:54,048 --> 00:23:56,039
Personally, I love this room.
- What do you mean 'which' room?

262
00:23:59,389 --> 00:24:01,550
Both of you will
share a room, right?

263
00:24:01,625 --> 00:24:02,683
What?

264
00:24:03,762 --> 00:24:05,457
Kunal..
- Shut up! Just shut up!

265
00:24:06,132 --> 00:24:07,497
We'll not share a room.

266
00:24:08,034 --> 00:24:11,526
It'll just be more expensive
for you. Two rooms, that's 4,000!

267
00:24:11,606 --> 00:24:13,403
Yes, Kunal. Neha is right.
- Yes!

268
00:24:13,476 --> 00:24:15,603
It'll be expensive.
- Okay, we'll find another place.

269
00:24:15,678 --> 00:24:20,706
No, no. Cute.
I love it when he jokes.

270
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:25,151
So sweet! Neha, actually,
we'll take both rooms.

271
00:24:25,425 --> 00:24:26,687
It'll be easier for you too.

272
00:24:26,761 --> 00:24:28,058
I mean you don't have to
look for another tenant.

273
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,490
Cool with me.
- Yes!

274
00:24:32,935 --> 00:24:34,493
Any questions?
- No, no.

275
00:24:34,838 --> 00:24:35,896
Are you single?

276
00:24:36,741 --> 00:24:37,935
Look at the terrace. It's beautiful.

277
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:39,442
The light is clear. Nice. Show me.

278
00:24:39,512 --> 00:24:40,570
Do you want to see it?
- Show me.

279
00:24:40,646 --> 00:24:41,704
Sort it out with her.

280
00:24:41,782 --> 00:24:42,840
I'll sort it out with her.
Will you stop doing this?

281
00:24:42,916 --> 00:24:44,110
Whats single?
- Just go and talk to her.

282
00:24:44,185 --> 00:24:47,177
Shut up
- Just keep aunty a way

283
00:24:48,458 --> 00:24:54,658
Wow! A pool.
- But listen.. huge apartment..

284
00:24:55,534 --> 00:24:57,729
didn't think when I bought it

285
00:24:57,804 --> 00:24:59,533
..and now the bank loan..

286
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:08,175
Neha, this whole gay thing.
You're cool with it, right?

287
00:25:09,487 --> 00:25:11,682
Because you know, what
difference does it make..

288
00:25:11,757 --> 00:25:13,622
You know, who's
straight and who's gay..

289
00:25:13,693 --> 00:25:16,560
Yes, absolutely! I mean,
it's your personal choice.

290
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:18,655
To each their own.
- Right, right. Thank you.

291
00:25:18,733 --> 00:25:20,132
Gay rights.
- Yeah! Yeah!

292
00:25:20,235 --> 00:25:25,696
Because your aunt
had scared us a bit..

293
00:25:25,944 --> 00:25:27,002
Aunt?

294
00:25:27,078 --> 00:25:28,670
Yes, your aunt. She's very scary.
- Don't worry about her.

295
00:25:28,747 --> 00:25:30,112
No, no. You'll get used to it.

296
00:25:30,182 --> 00:25:34,676
Yes, I hope so because
when we came she was like..

297
00:25:34,755 --> 00:25:37,656
We don't want boys.
We want girls..

298
00:25:37,726 --> 00:25:39,523
So you know, we both
were just wondering..

299
00:25:39,596 --> 00:25:43,532
..that if she's the only one
who has a problem with boys..

300
00:25:43,602 --> 00:25:45,695
..or do you also feel like that?

301
00:25:46,539 --> 00:25:49,167
Well, I didn't think
that I'd be with boys..

302
00:25:49,877 --> 00:25:51,276
Sam!

303
00:25:56,286 --> 00:25:58,015
Sam!

304
00:25:59,624 --> 00:26:01,819
Hey! What are you doing here?

305
00:26:04,864 --> 00:26:10,632
All this isn't allowed here.
Stand straight. What are you doing?

306
00:26:10,706 --> 00:26:11,764
What?

307
00:26:12,742 --> 00:26:14,232
What do you do professionally?

308
00:26:14,678 --> 00:26:16,111
Well, I'm a photographer.

309
00:26:18,317 --> 00:26:21,650
Will you click pictures if I model?

310
00:26:35,708 --> 00:26:38,199
Hey, tall fellow!
Why are you laughing?

311
00:26:38,278 --> 00:26:39,836
What do you do?

312
00:26:40,147 --> 00:26:41,205
I'm a nurse.

313
00:26:41,616 --> 00:26:46,349
Nurse?! Nurse, do they make
you wear short skirts too?

314
00:26:53,132 --> 00:26:56,101
Since when have the
two of you been a couple?

315
00:26:58,239 --> 00:26:59,331
Well, three years.

316
00:26:59,641 --> 00:27:00,699
Three years?!

317
00:27:01,243 --> 00:27:03,711
Wow!
- That's a really long time.

318
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:06,112
Very good. Very good.
Tell me your love story.

319
00:27:07,218 --> 00:27:08,276
Love story?!

320
00:27:08,387 --> 00:27:10,184
Where did the two of you
meet for the first time?

321
00:27:10,991 --> 00:27:12,049
We?

322
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:13,918
We..

323
00:27:14,061 --> 00:27:16,188
We.. we..

324
00:27:16,665 --> 00:27:17,757
Go on, tell us.

325
00:27:18,735 --> 00:27:19,827
Don't be shy.

326
00:27:19,902 --> 00:27:24,737
No, we met in Venice.

327
00:27:25,745 --> 00:27:26,871
Venice!

328
00:27:27,948 --> 00:27:31,315
I met Kunal in
Venice the first time.

329
00:27:48,376 --> 00:27:52,142
In that very first meeting,
Kunal showed me a thousand dreams.

330
00:27:53,116 --> 00:27:59,453
I felt as if I was standing
and the ground below was moving.

331
00:27:59,792 --> 00:28:04,786
My heart beat faster.
I gasped for breath..

332
00:28:04,966 --> 00:28:10,165
Is this my first love?

333
00:28:12,142 --> 00:28:15,236
For the next few days,
fate made us bump into each other.

334
00:28:15,815 --> 00:28:18,807
At times here, at times there..

335
00:28:23,826 --> 00:28:27,284
..and finally I gathered the
courage and said something to him.

336
00:28:27,765 --> 00:28:33,931
Why are you following me around?

337
00:28:40,182 --> 00:28:42,980
Alas! Why didn't my
tongue shred to pieces?!

338
00:28:43,286 --> 00:28:45,880
He left so suddenly that
I never saw him after that.

339
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,357
I searched a lot for him.

340
00:28:49,896 --> 00:28:51,864
I didn't even know his
name to call out to him!

341
00:28:52,031 --> 00:28:56,127
Dearest, beloved, my darling?

342
00:29:04,817 --> 00:29:06,876
But he was nowhere to be found.

343
00:29:07,052 --> 00:29:11,011
Tired and defeated,
I returned to my hotel.

344
00:29:11,559 --> 00:29:13,891
There was a letter waiting for me.

345
00:29:14,029 --> 00:29:17,157
My first love letter in
which it was written..

346
00:29:17,301 --> 00:29:19,929
At the seashore,
my heart calls out to you.. oh!

347
00:29:25,345 --> 00:29:28,837
I immediately wore my new
Gucci shoes with my Armani jacket..

348
00:29:28,917 --> 00:29:30,976
..and set off towards my destiny.

349
00:29:31,921 --> 00:29:36,381
Kunal was on the
other side of the sea.

350
00:29:36,928 --> 00:29:39,988
My legs trembled as
I moved towards him.

351
00:29:40,166 --> 00:29:42,862
Bathed in the moonlight,
with a rose clenched..

352
00:29:42,937 --> 00:29:46,930
..between his teeth, Kunal. Kunal..

353
00:30:01,462 --> 00:30:05,523
And then a sigh
escaped his soft lips.

354
00:30:05,635 --> 00:30:07,296
What a wonderful story!

355
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:10,097
It was beautiful.

356
00:30:10,175 --> 00:30:12,075
That's so sweet.
I think I'm going to cry.

357
00:30:12,144 --> 00:30:14,203
Sweet, baby. Sweet.

358
00:30:16,583 --> 00:30:19,245
All right.
- Yes.

359
00:30:19,455 --> 00:30:20,513
Okay.

360
00:30:24,127 --> 00:30:26,095
Welcome to the family.

361
00:30:34,008 --> 00:30:36,067
I'll be all right.
I'll be all right.

362
00:30:38,381 --> 00:30:39,439
I'll be all right.

363
00:30:40,017 --> 00:30:43,043
With you around,
the crooked pathways..

364
00:30:43,354 --> 00:30:48,018
Ridiculous and crazy talk,
everything seems fine.

365
00:30:48,495 --> 00:30:51,430
With you around,
false promises and..

366
00:30:51,499 --> 00:30:56,698
..the intentions of my
enemies all seem true.

367
00:30:57,541 --> 00:31:00,066
The only thing that
makes my heart skip a beat..

368
00:31:00,145 --> 00:31:02,272
..it's you. Only you.

369
00:31:02,348 --> 00:31:05,044
You're the one who makes me
laugh while I cry.

370
00:31:05,118 --> 00:31:07,313
You're the one..

371
00:31:07,388 --> 00:31:09,413
I don't know why.
- I don't know why.

372
00:31:09,491 --> 00:31:14,656
My heart knows that if
you're around, I'll be all right.

373
00:31:14,732 --> 00:31:17,064
I'll be all right.
I'll be alright.

374
00:31:17,135 --> 00:31:19,000
I don't know why.
- I don't know why.

375
00:31:19,071 --> 00:31:24,236
My heart knows that if
you're around, I'll be all right.

376
00:31:24,312 --> 00:31:26,644
I'll be all right.
I'll be all right.

377
00:31:45,775 --> 00:31:50,303
The entire world is on one
side and we're on the other.

378
00:31:50,682 --> 00:31:55,051
Every joy evaporates.
I find only sorrow.

379
00:31:55,122 --> 00:31:59,320
But when you smile for me,
the world seems all right.

380
00:31:59,395 --> 00:32:04,230
My life blooms again in a moment.

381
00:32:04,301 --> 00:32:05,529
I don't know why.

382
00:32:08,073 --> 00:32:09,472
I don't know why.
- I don't know why.

383
00:32:09,542 --> 00:32:14,741
My heart knows that if
you're around, I'll be all right.

384
00:32:14,816 --> 00:32:17,148
I'll be all right.
I'll be all right.

385
00:32:17,219 --> 00:32:19,084
I don't know why.
- I don't know why.

386
00:32:19,156 --> 00:32:24,355
My heart knows that if
you're around, I'll be all right.

387
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:26,455
I'll be all right.
I'll be all right.

388
00:32:30,171 --> 00:32:31,399
Yeah.. yeah, yeah.

389
00:32:31,473 --> 00:32:34,670
I'll be all right.
I'll be all right.

390
00:32:35,111 --> 00:32:36,169
Yeah.. yeah, yeah.

391
00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:39,510
I'll be all right.
I'll be all right.

392
00:32:39,784 --> 00:32:40,842
Yeah.. yeah, yeah.

393
00:32:41,119 --> 00:32:44,611
I'll be all right.
I'll be all right.

394
00:32:44,691 --> 00:32:45,749
Yeah.. yeah, yeah.

395
00:32:45,826 --> 00:32:49,227
I'll be all right.
I'll be all right.

396
00:32:59,145 --> 00:33:01,136
It's a friendship
that has blossomed..

397
00:33:01,214 --> 00:33:03,546
..with every passing moment.

398
00:33:03,885 --> 00:33:06,285
I don't know why I feel..

399
00:33:06,355 --> 00:33:08,152
..I know her.

400
00:33:08,224 --> 00:33:12,752
Because when you smile for me,
the world seems all right.

401
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:18,826
These passing
moments freeze right here.

402
00:33:19,173 --> 00:33:20,572
I don't know why..

403
00:33:20,741 --> 00:33:22,709
I don't know why.
- I don't know why.

404
00:33:22,777 --> 00:33:28,181
My heart knows that if
you're around, I'll be all right.

405
00:33:28,252 --> 00:33:30,243
I'll be all right.
I'll be all right.

406
00:33:30,321 --> 00:33:32,380
I don't know why.
- I don't know why.

407
00:33:32,458 --> 00:33:37,589
My heart knows that if
you're around, I'll be all right.

408
00:33:37,665 --> 00:33:39,724
I'll be all right.
I'll be all right.

409
00:33:39,801 --> 00:33:42,269
With you around,
the crooked pathways..

410
00:33:42,405 --> 00:33:47,274
Ridiculous and crazy talk,
everything seems fine.

411
00:33:47,445 --> 00:33:50,881
With you around,
false promises and..

412
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:55,444
..the intentions of my enemies,
all seem true.

413
00:33:55,890 --> 00:33:59,223
The only thing that
makes my heart skip a beat..

414
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:01,287
..it's you. Only you.

415
00:34:01,365 --> 00:34:03,890
You're the one who
makes me laugh while I cry.

416
00:34:03,969 --> 00:34:06,301
You're the one..

417
00:34:06,439 --> 00:34:08,304
I don't know why.
- I don't know why.

418
00:34:08,374 --> 00:34:13,607
My heart knows that if
you're around, I'll be all right.

419
00:34:13,683 --> 00:34:15,844
I'll be all right.
I'll be all right.

420
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:17,909
I don't know why.
- I don't know why.

421
00:34:17,988 --> 00:34:23,255
My heart knows that if
you're around, I'll be all right.

422
00:34:23,329 --> 00:34:25,559
I'll be all right.
I'll be all right.

423
00:34:25,632 --> 00:34:27,600
I don't know why.
- I don't know why.

424
00:34:27,668 --> 00:34:32,765
My heart knows that if
you're around, I'll be all right.

425
00:34:32,842 --> 00:34:35,333
I'll be all right.
I'll be all right.

426
00:34:41,888 --> 00:34:42,946
What happened?

427
00:34:43,023 --> 00:34:45,287
Mom, man! I mean, I've come
here all the way from London..

428
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:47,760
..yet I'm not able to
get mom off my back.

429
00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:50,355
Come on, Sam! How can anybody
want to get rid of their mom?

430
00:34:50,901 --> 00:34:52,835
You don't know my mom.

431
00:34:53,305 --> 00:34:54,363
Still..

432
00:34:54,539 --> 00:34:57,030
It's like a full-on
hardcore Punjabi ham scene.

433
00:34:57,477 --> 00:35:00,537
Tears pour down for the silliest
things, dialogues, everything.

434
00:35:00,915 --> 00:35:02,974
And day or night it's
always the same thing.

435
00:35:03,753 --> 00:35:06,313
Why don't you get married? Mrs.
Khanna's cousin from..

436
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:09,723
..Amritsar has two daughters.
It's a buffet.

437
00:35:09,794 --> 00:35:10,852
Choose whichever you want.

438
00:35:10,929 --> 00:35:15,059
Oh, my God! So you haven't
told your mom about you..

439
00:35:15,635 --> 00:35:17,068
You know, you and Kunal..

440
00:35:18,507 --> 00:35:21,840
No, she's very conservative.

441
00:35:23,347 --> 00:35:25,338
So tell me, Neha, if Sam
and I were not gay..

442
00:35:25,416 --> 00:35:27,850
..then would you have
had us as your tenants?

443
00:35:28,487 --> 00:35:30,352
Of course not! Because
if you hadn't been gay..

444
00:35:30,423 --> 00:35:33,358
..then sooner or later you
would have been interested in me..

445
00:35:33,428 --> 00:35:34,986
..and then life
would've become strange.

446
00:35:35,563 --> 00:35:37,758
Wow! You're so modest.

447
00:35:39,102 --> 00:35:41,969
Seriously, my mom and dad
wouldn't have allowed it.

448
00:35:43,442 --> 00:35:45,467
Mom?
- Dad?

449
00:35:46,379 --> 00:35:47,437
They're also there?

450
00:35:47,513 --> 00:35:54,612
No, they passed away in a car
crash. I was nine years old then.

451
00:35:58,663 --> 00:36:00,392
Since then I think
of them whenever..

452
00:36:00,465 --> 00:36:02,990
..I have to make an
important decision.

453
00:36:03,069 --> 00:36:05,503
Like what would they
have done in my position?

454
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:09,734
So what would they have said?

455
00:36:09,878 --> 00:36:10,936
About what?

456
00:36:11,147 --> 00:36:13,411
You know, about this
situation of ours.

457
00:36:13,484 --> 00:36:16,920
Oh! I think they'd have been a
little happy and a little sad too.

458
00:36:18,424 --> 00:36:19,482
Meaning?

459
00:36:20,159 --> 00:36:22,992
Happy because I'm
living with two strong men.

460
00:36:25,667 --> 00:36:26,759
And the butt talk?

461
00:36:28,438 --> 00:36:30,429
Sad.. sad.. why would they be sad?

462
00:36:30,508 --> 00:36:34,444
Right. And they'd be sad
that my roommates protect me..

463
00:36:34,513 --> 00:36:37,175
..not my husband or my boyfriend.

464
00:36:38,719 --> 00:36:41,586
That's ok, we're no
less than other men.

465
00:36:41,689 --> 00:36:43,020
We're two regular Gabbars
(villain in the film 'Sholay').

466
00:36:43,459 --> 00:36:44,517
Gabbar?!
- What?

467
00:36:44,593 --> 00:36:48,620
Yes, Gabbar. Gabbar Singh
from the movie 'Sholay.'

468
00:36:48,699 --> 00:36:49,791
But what does he
have to do with this?

469
00:36:50,067 --> 00:36:52,535
Come on, Kunal. Haven't you
seen the film? Gabbar was gay!

470
00:36:54,541 --> 00:36:55,599
Gabbar wasn't gay.

471
00:36:55,743 --> 00:36:57,472
Okay, if a man walks
around with a belt in his hand..

472
00:36:57,545 --> 00:36:59,570
..throughout a movie,
asking the same question..

473
00:36:59,648 --> 00:37:02,048
'How many men were there?'
Then he has to be gay, right?

474
00:37:02,485 --> 00:37:04,544
Shut up, Sam.
- Dude, Gabbar wasn't gay.

475
00:37:04,621 --> 00:37:06,714
Of course he was gay.
He was a full-on flamer.

476
00:37:06,791 --> 00:37:10,022
Shut up, Sam!
- He was.. he was gay. He was gay.

477
00:37:15,504 --> 00:37:17,495
Dude! - Now don't tell me
that there wasn't anything..

478
00:37:17,573 --> 00:37:18,767
..between Munna and
Circuit (movie characters).

479
00:37:19,142 --> 00:37:21,667
I mean, come on. That was
by far the most obvious one.

480
00:37:21,745 --> 00:37:23,235
Circuit addresses
Munna as a brother would.

481
00:37:23,915 --> 00:37:26,577
So? Even I call you
brother in public.

482
00:37:27,855 --> 00:37:29,720
Guys, what are you doing here?

483
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:30,848
We have to file papers.

484
00:37:31,259 --> 00:37:33,693
I know, but the queue
for gay couples is there.

485
00:37:34,129 --> 00:37:35,187
Queue for gay couples?!

486
00:37:35,265 --> 00:37:37,529
Yes. If you file a
petition as a couple then..

487
00:37:37,601 --> 00:37:40,661
..you get a
residency permit much faster.

488
00:37:40,839 --> 00:37:43,535
Maybe even in a year or else
it'll take you at least five years.

489
00:37:43,610 --> 00:37:46,602
What? You didn't know that?
Come on. I've got to get to work.

490
00:37:50,786 --> 00:37:52,549
You're absolutely insane,
you know that?

491
00:37:52,623 --> 00:37:55,888
Sam, Sam. Sam, open the door.

492
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,985
What? Are you serious? No.

493
00:38:00,967 --> 00:38:03,231
Come on, dude. I'll get
the papers in a year's time.

494
00:38:04,572 --> 00:38:06,767
Kunal, you were finding it
difficult to tell Neha about it.

495
00:38:06,842 --> 00:38:08,969
But now you want to
make us officially gay.

496
00:38:09,045 --> 00:38:11,070
Dude, we just have to sign a paper.

497
00:38:11,582 --> 00:38:13,641
If we're caught then
we're going straight to jail.

498
00:38:13,852 --> 00:38:15,683
Dude, no one's going to catch us.

499
00:38:27,605 --> 00:38:30,733
Sam, please do this for me.
I'll do anything for you, please.

500
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:33,677
Anything?
- Anything.

501
00:38:35,883 --> 00:38:37,680
I'll use the bathroom
first in the morning. - Done.

502
00:38:37,752 --> 00:38:38,946
You'll make coffee for me.
- Done.

503
00:38:40,623 --> 00:38:44,218
You'll introduce me to models.
- Promise, I swear. Done.

504
00:38:44,328 --> 00:38:45,625
Awesome. You'll have to schedule..

505
00:38:45,697 --> 00:38:47,358
..a fantastic photo shoot for aunty.

506
00:38:47,766 --> 00:38:49,996
Dude, done.

507
00:38:51,037 --> 00:38:56,703
Really? You're very desperate,
aren't you? Ok, done.

508
00:39:27,422 --> 00:39:29,322
He's here!

509
00:39:35,767 --> 00:39:39,294
The mayor's charity ball tonight.
- I know.

510
00:39:39,371 --> 00:39:40,770
Morning M! Pedro
Almadovar called three times.

511
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:44,139
I don't care and I know. I know.

512
00:39:45,781 --> 00:39:47,772
M darling, you look gorgeous today.

513
00:39:49,953 --> 00:39:51,011
Coffee?

514
00:39:52,123 --> 00:39:55,923
Neha darling, only you know what
I like to hear in the morning.

515
00:39:56,295 --> 00:39:57,353
Give me a kiss. Come.

516
00:39:58,398 --> 00:39:59,456
Got your mail.

517
00:39:59,734 --> 00:40:01,099
Speaking of males, come with me.

518
00:40:02,071 --> 00:40:03,129
What is this I hear?

519
00:40:03,205 --> 00:40:05,264
You are living with two guys,
you naughty girl?!

520
00:40:05,341 --> 00:40:06,467
I didn't know that
you had it in you.

521
00:40:06,743 --> 00:40:10,179
It's really not as exciting as
you think it is. Trust me. - Why?

522
00:40:10,482 --> 00:40:15,078
Because, as usual, both are hot,
good looking, funny and sweet but..

523
00:40:15,155 --> 00:40:16,213
What's the problem?

524
00:40:17,258 --> 00:40:18,350
Both are gay.

525
00:40:19,327 --> 00:40:21,818
Yummy, why don't you introduce me?

526
00:40:22,766 --> 00:40:26,327
M, why have you
received a letter from Diva?

527
00:40:29,909 --> 00:40:31,069
Aren't they competition?

528
00:40:33,981 --> 00:40:36,449
I'm quitting this job.
- What?!

529
00:40:36,518 --> 00:40:43,515
Diva has offered me a job.
As the new editor-in-chief.

530
00:40:43,795 --> 00:40:45,023
You're kidding, right?

531
00:40:45,364 --> 00:40:47,298
Why? Don't you think I can be
an editor-in-chief?

532
00:40:47,868 --> 00:40:49,859
Oh no, no. Not at all.

533
00:40:49,937 --> 00:40:55,876
In fact, it's just that
we'll really miss you, M.

534
00:40:55,945 --> 00:40:58,971
You liar. You're lying.
Everybody hates me.

535
00:40:59,216 --> 00:41:00,808
Just waiting for me to go.

536
00:41:00,886 --> 00:41:03,184
So that one of you can get
my chair and office.

537
00:41:03,823 --> 00:41:07,418
Okay, so you're right. Who's going to
get this chair and office?

538
00:41:10,166 --> 00:41:12,361
Actually, the decision is mine.

539
00:41:16,942 --> 00:41:19,137
Dinner at my place. Tomorrow night.

540
00:41:19,211 --> 00:41:20,508
Really? Why?

541
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:22,514
I'll introduce you to Sam and Kunal.

542
00:41:23,184 --> 00:41:24,913
I'm sure you'll love them.

543
00:41:24,986 --> 00:41:26,419
I'm sure I will.

544
00:41:28,224 --> 00:41:30,249
Are you mad? Why did you agree?

545
00:41:30,594 --> 00:41:34,086
She said that her boss wants
to meet us and you agreed.

546
00:41:34,166 --> 00:41:35,224
What else could I have said?

547
00:41:35,968 --> 00:41:37,936
Guess what, Neha? We're not gay..

548
00:41:38,004 --> 00:41:41,132
We were lying only because
your house is so beautiful.

549
00:41:41,542 --> 00:41:42,600
Come on. Seriously..

550
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,538
Yes?

551
00:41:45,982 --> 00:41:47,449
A letter from the
immigration office.

552
00:41:48,385 --> 00:41:49,477
What's written in it?

553
00:41:49,955 --> 00:41:51,047
I don't know.

554
00:41:54,895 --> 00:41:56,487
Read it, Kunal.
- Yes. - Yes.

555
00:41:57,065 --> 00:42:05,029
Thank you. Well..

556
00:42:07,112 --> 00:42:09,979
Yes, yes. They've
accepted our petition.

557
00:42:10,049 --> 00:42:13,018
All right! Show it to me!

558
00:42:19,930 --> 00:42:21,295
Why is only your name on it?

559
00:42:22,533 --> 00:42:23,591
How's that possible?

560
00:42:27,574 --> 00:42:29,166
Oh, rubbish!

561
00:42:29,610 --> 00:42:30,668
What happened?

562
00:42:32,347 --> 00:42:35,510
I've written my London address
in my form.

563
00:42:35,585 --> 00:42:39,021
So?
- So, my mother..

564
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,059
I'm not going to do
anything with any other man.

565
00:43:12,236 --> 00:43:14,431
I've told this to Sam earlier.
Now, you hear it too.

566
00:43:14,506 --> 00:43:16,098
Kunal, please don't do
this to me right now.

567
00:43:16,676 --> 00:43:19,008
My boss will be here
anytime now. Sam had promised me.

568
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:20,138
But I hadn't promised you.

569
00:43:22,584 --> 00:43:25,018
You! You had promised me.
When M comes here..

570
00:43:25,088 --> 00:43:27,613
..you'd better be ready.

571
00:43:31,764 --> 00:43:33,493
Good luck, brother.
- Yeah? - Yeah.

572
00:43:44,148 --> 00:43:45,206
M darling..

573
00:43:45,616 --> 00:43:46,674
Neha darling!

574
00:43:47,786 --> 00:43:49,083
So glad that you could come.

575
00:43:50,056 --> 00:43:51,114
It's a candle.

576
00:43:51,625 --> 00:43:54,287
Oh, fabulous!
I needed it so badly.

577
00:43:55,196 --> 00:43:56,254
Nice place.

578
00:43:56,432 --> 00:43:58,366
Really? You like it?
Thank you so much. There..

579
00:44:02,707 --> 00:44:06,302
Darling, your housemaid
is a fashion disaster.

580
00:44:06,379 --> 00:44:08,313
Get rid of her.
- No, no. M! M! M!

581
00:44:08,381 --> 00:44:10,076
You're.. you're fired. No, no,
one second. You're fired please..

582
00:44:10,151 --> 00:44:11,709
Out! Out!
- No, M. She's my aunt. My aunt.

583
00:44:13,488 --> 00:44:14,614
So sorry, aunty.

584
00:44:14,724 --> 00:44:15,816
What's that tied around your neck?

585
00:44:16,093 --> 00:44:18,118
Aunt, that's because he has a cold.

586
00:44:18,495 --> 00:44:21,692
Please keep this in the
kitchen and the microwave buzzed.

587
00:44:21,767 --> 00:44:22,825
I think dinner is ready.

588
00:44:24,371 --> 00:44:25,702
What did you want me to do?
Look at how she was dressed.

589
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:27,101
No, no, it's fine. Don't worry.

590
00:44:27,175 --> 00:44:28,369
Absolutely not my fault.
- Please.

591
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:41,925
M, this is Sam. Sam, this is M.

592
00:44:47,737 --> 00:44:53,471
Neha, you never told me
that your boss is so hot.

593
00:44:58,486 --> 00:45:00,351
I like hot.

594
00:45:05,763 --> 00:45:06,821
One moment..

595
00:45:12,138 --> 00:45:13,867
Oh, Kunal..

596
00:45:14,508 --> 00:45:16,499
Kunal darling!

597
00:45:17,445 --> 00:45:23,509
That's M.. the door..

598
00:45:23,788 --> 00:45:25,085
Shall I get it?
- I'll get it.

599
00:45:25,891 --> 00:45:26,949
He'll get it.

600
00:45:30,296 --> 00:45:31,354
So should we sit?

601
00:45:32,466 --> 00:45:33,797
Yes, I'd love to actually.

602
00:45:37,908 --> 00:45:39,273
Well, hello!
- Hello!

603
00:45:39,409 --> 00:45:42,276
Officer Javier from
the immigration office.

604
00:45:43,482 --> 00:45:46,815
Didn't you get the letter?
It said that someone would come by..

605
00:45:46,887 --> 00:45:48,878
..for a surprise inspection.

606
00:45:49,223 --> 00:45:50,417
Surprise inspection?

607
00:45:50,826 --> 00:45:54,262
You see, a lot of people
fake these things, you know.

608
00:45:54,564 --> 00:45:56,259
Pretend to be gay.

609
00:45:56,433 --> 00:45:59,197
Really? How desperate!

610
00:45:59,571 --> 00:46:05,168
I know. So I'm here
to keep my eye on you.

611
00:46:07,582 --> 00:46:12,451
Eye on me? Well.. Can I come in?

612
00:46:12,522 --> 00:46:15,047
Yes, sure. Sure.

613
00:46:19,232 --> 00:46:21,598
Sam, officer..

614
00:46:21,869 --> 00:46:22,927
Javier.

615
00:46:23,872 --> 00:46:26,602
From the immigrations office.

616
00:46:30,882 --> 00:46:35,979
Hi, officer!

617
00:46:37,892 --> 00:46:38,984
Just a second please.

618
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:41,421
Sure.
- Excuse me.

619
00:46:44,267 --> 00:46:45,962
Hell! What do we do now?

620
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:48,904
Son, now whatever is to
be done he is going to do.

621
00:46:49,908 --> 00:46:50,966
This is not funny, okay?

622
00:46:51,077 --> 00:46:52,271
Yes. Well, do I look
like I'm laughing?

623
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:54,538
Why has he come here?

624
00:46:54,648 --> 00:46:57,116
To check if we're truly
gay or just pretending to be.

625
00:46:57,252 --> 00:46:58,981
What do you mean? - Please..
please tell me what to do.

626
00:47:00,924 --> 00:47:02,653
Let's think.
Let's just stay calm. Think.

627
00:47:05,664 --> 00:47:07,495
Just think like a girl

628
00:47:11,672 --> 00:47:14,937
Hey, hero! Think like
a girl. Not about them.

629
00:47:15,478 --> 00:47:16,672
What do you mean think like a girl?

630
00:47:17,013 --> 00:47:19,675
I mean, talk to him
about his hair, his shoes.

631
00:47:19,951 --> 00:47:21,043
You know, this kind of thing.

632
00:47:23,088 --> 00:47:25,215
Think like a woman,
feel like a man.

633
00:47:25,692 --> 00:47:28,126
Think like a woman, feel like a man.
- Feel like a man.

634
00:47:28,963 --> 00:47:32,364
No idiot, think like a man,
feel like a.. confused.. come on!

635
00:47:32,468 --> 00:47:33,526
Okay.

636
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:47,715
Neha was telling me that
you're new here. - Nice shoes.

637
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:51,983
Yes, actually I'm from London and..

638
00:47:52,062 --> 00:47:55,998
..I work at Howard Medical Centre.

639
00:47:57,135 --> 00:48:00,195
Oh.. doctor. Doctor.

640
00:48:02,744 --> 00:48:04,075
Nurse. Nurse.

641
00:48:05,748 --> 00:48:08,308
My temperature is increasing.
Must be the wine.

642
00:48:11,689 --> 00:48:12,747
Shall we have some fun?

643
00:48:14,026 --> 00:48:16,517
What do you mean?
- I mean, fun..

644
00:48:16,629 --> 00:48:19,029
Oh, my God! Why don't we
play some music? Dance..

645
00:48:19,133 --> 00:48:22,125
I don't mind. I love dirty dancing.
Let's go. Yes.

646
00:49:53,499 --> 00:49:54,557
Who's that?

647
00:49:54,734 --> 00:49:56,634
My mother. Mom!

648
00:49:57,738 --> 00:49:58,796
Oh aunty!

649
00:50:05,582 --> 00:50:09,916
Son, I felt I had a bad dream.

650
00:50:12,192 --> 00:50:16,219
Aunty, feeling better?

651
00:50:16,564 --> 00:50:18,259
What's all this, son?

652
00:50:18,367 --> 00:50:21,200
No, mom. It's just that
we were playing a game..

653
00:50:21,271 --> 00:50:25,367
..and it was my turn. Can I just
see you outside for a second?

654
00:50:25,710 --> 00:50:27,678
Thank you. Come. Come.
We'll be right back.

655
00:50:27,813 --> 00:50:28,939
Relax. Just relax.

656
00:50:32,687 --> 00:50:34,712
Your mother doesn't
know about you, does she?

657
00:50:35,291 --> 00:50:41,821
How would she know,
poor baby? Come to daddy.

658
00:50:45,238 --> 00:50:47,968
Living a lie, and
that too, for others.

659
00:50:48,776 --> 00:50:53,236
It hurts. It really, really hurts.
Till today, I haven't told..

660
00:50:53,316 --> 00:50:55,307
..my mom and dad that their Murli..

661
00:50:56,286 --> 00:51:00,245
Murli?! - Murli.. me.. M..
you know, darling.

662
00:51:01,595 --> 00:51:03,358
No!

663
00:51:03,430 --> 00:51:04,488
God, she's back.

664
00:51:04,599 --> 00:51:06,499
Is this a house or a madhouse?!
- Mom!

665
00:51:06,602 --> 00:51:07,728
Don't you dare call me mother!

666
00:51:07,869 --> 00:51:10,269
Did you think even a
little about my old age..

667
00:51:10,406 --> 00:51:12,704
Now why are you sitting in
his lap. Get away from him!

668
00:51:12,943 --> 00:51:14,342
Let me talk to her. Let me

669
00:51:14,446 --> 00:51:16,641
Don't you dare touch
my son, you witch!

670
00:51:16,749 --> 00:51:18,410
You will have a
mother's curse on you

671
00:51:18,651 --> 00:51:19,709
Come back home. Come back home.

672
00:51:19,786 --> 00:51:22,687
Come to London with me.
You were better off there.

673
00:51:22,824 --> 00:51:25,657
You were with girls there.
Here, you are.. just come back home.

674
00:51:25,761 --> 00:51:26,819
No, no, no. One sec,
one sec, one sec.

675
00:51:26,896 --> 00:51:32,357
Let me talk to her. Aunty!
Aunty! Look at me. Look at me.

676
00:51:32,638 --> 00:51:37,803
Whether it's London or Miami,
your son is gay. He likes men.

677
00:51:37,911 --> 00:51:39,310
Wake up!

678
00:51:39,648 --> 00:51:40,706
Shut up!

679
00:51:40,882 --> 00:51:44,648
Mom! Don't listen to him, mom.
He's talking nonsense.

680
00:51:44,721 --> 00:51:45,779
I'm not gay.

681
00:51:46,324 --> 00:51:47,916
You told me
yourself that you are gay.

682
00:51:47,992 --> 00:51:49,050
He told you?

683
00:51:49,328 --> 00:51:51,694
No, aunty. Sam's telling the truth.
There's nothing to it.

684
00:51:51,831 --> 00:51:54,732
He'll obviously lie.
He's Sameer's boyfriend.

685
00:51:54,835 --> 00:51:55,893
Boyfriend?!

686
00:51:56,003 --> 00:51:58,062
Boyfriend?! Neha, you told
me that they both were single.

687
00:51:58,340 --> 00:51:59,671
They are..

688
00:51:59,909 --> 00:52:02,377
Single? No, no, no.
They are a couple.

689
00:52:02,746 --> 00:52:04,805
They applied for a
residency permit together.

690
00:52:04,949 --> 00:52:09,477
Rascal! You dared to lie to
your mother! I know everything.

691
00:52:09,723 --> 00:52:12,851
I received the letter.
That's why I've come here.

692
00:52:13,962 --> 00:52:15,862
Oh God! Grant me death!

693
00:52:15,931 --> 00:52:16,989
Mom!

694
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:19,364
What are you punishing me for, God?!

695
00:52:19,737 --> 00:52:23,901
No, mom.. - This uncle with the
yellow-shirt is after my child.

696
00:52:23,976 --> 00:52:25,034
Mom!

697
00:52:25,111 --> 00:52:26,578
Who is she talking to?

698
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:29,581
Come on, Sam, for how long
will you hide your love?

699
00:52:30,919 --> 00:52:34,650
I think it's time. Tell
your 'Venice story' to aunty.

700
00:52:34,891 --> 00:52:37,758
Venice?! You went to Venice?
- No, no..

701
00:52:37,862 --> 00:52:41,491
No, no. It's all my fault.
I never kept a check on you.

702
00:52:41,735 --> 00:52:42,793
Had I done so,
then you wouldn't be..

703
00:52:42,869 --> 00:52:43,927
..committing all these mistakes.

704
00:52:44,038 --> 00:52:47,906
Aunty, love isn't a mistake.
Love is blind. Isn't it?

705
00:52:48,043 --> 00:52:49,408
It isn't so blind that..

706
00:52:49,479 --> 00:52:51,413
..it can't differentiate
between a guy and a girl.

707
00:52:51,482 --> 00:52:52,540
Mom!

708
00:52:52,649 --> 00:52:56,710
Stop it, please! It's enough.
I'm struck with grief.

709
00:52:56,822 --> 00:52:58,016
Mom, listen to me. Mom!

710
00:52:58,124 --> 00:53:00,058
Thank you, son. I don't want
to listen to anything anymore.

711
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:01,422
Mom, please..

712
00:53:01,496 --> 00:53:06,524
You'll support me well..
- Mom!

713
00:53:10,074 --> 00:53:12,065
Your son rides the
bride's palanquin.

714
00:53:12,177 --> 00:53:13,508
Alas! You're done for!

715
00:53:13,913 --> 00:53:16,006
Your son rides the
bride's palanquin.

716
00:53:16,116 --> 00:53:17,708
Alas! You're done for!

717
00:53:22,458 --> 00:53:24,619
Ignoring the young damsels..

718
00:53:24,828 --> 00:53:26,819
What is this
dilemma of the heart?!

719
00:53:30,803 --> 00:53:32,896
Ignoring the young damsels..

720
00:53:33,006 --> 00:53:35,099
What is this
dilemma of the heart?!

721
00:53:35,209 --> 00:53:37,040
Ignoring the young damsels..

722
00:53:37,145 --> 00:53:39,204
What is this
dilemma of the heart?!

723
00:53:39,482 --> 00:53:41,541
Men express fondness for men..

724
00:53:41,819 --> 00:53:43,548
Men express fondness for men..

725
00:53:43,822 --> 00:53:45,585
The boy wearing the bride's gown..

726
00:53:45,858 --> 00:53:47,519
A mom's dream has been shattered.

727
00:53:47,827 --> 00:53:48,885
Mama's boy..

728
00:53:49,796 --> 00:53:51,661
Mama's boy has gotten spoilt.

729
00:53:51,766 --> 00:53:53,597
Mama's boy has gotten spoilt.

730
00:53:53,869 --> 00:53:55,666
Mama's boy has gotten spoilt.

731
00:53:55,872 --> 00:53:57,931
Mama's boy has gotten spoilt.

732
00:53:58,174 --> 00:54:00,039
Your son rides the
bride's palanquin.

733
00:54:00,110 --> 00:54:01,577
Alas! You're done for!

734
00:54:02,247 --> 00:54:04,238
Your son rides the
bride's palanquin.

735
00:54:04,517 --> 00:54:05,779
Alas! You're done for!

736
00:54:31,555 --> 00:54:35,548
God knows whose
evil shadow befell him.

737
00:54:39,866 --> 00:54:43,597
God knows whose
evil shadow befell him.

738
00:54:44,106 --> 00:54:47,803
He failed to admire the
shade of long tresses.

739
00:54:47,977 --> 00:54:49,945
He rots in the heat.
- Oh, my God!

740
00:54:50,047 --> 00:54:52,015
He behaves strangely.
- Oh, my God!

741
00:54:52,183 --> 00:54:54,151
Somebody set him straight.
- Stop him!

742
00:54:54,253 --> 00:54:56,312
He's possessed!
- Stop him!

743
00:54:56,623 --> 00:54:58,682
A pair of guys.. The girls weep.

744
00:54:58,860 --> 00:55:00,657
There wasn't any
need for them anymore.

745
00:55:01,063 --> 00:55:02,121
Mama's boy..

746
00:55:02,999 --> 00:55:04,660
Mama's boy has gotten spoilt.

747
00:55:04,968 --> 00:55:06,731
Mama's boy has gotten spoilt.

748
00:55:06,938 --> 00:55:08,769
Mama's boy has gotten spoilt.

749
00:55:08,874 --> 00:55:11,001
Mama's boy has gotten spoilt.

750
00:55:11,110 --> 00:55:13,203
Your son rides the
bride's palanquin.

751
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:15,339
Alas! You're done for!

752
00:55:15,617 --> 00:55:17,642
Your son rides the
bride's palanquin.

753
00:55:17,752 --> 00:55:19,617
Alas! You're done for!

754
00:55:19,755 --> 00:55:21,620
Ignoring the young damsels..

755
00:55:21,758 --> 00:55:23,623
What is this
dilemma of the heart?!

756
00:55:23,795 --> 00:55:25,695
Ignoring the young damsels..

757
00:55:25,898 --> 00:55:27,923
What is this
dilemma of the heart?!

758
00:55:28,034 --> 00:55:29,831
Men express fondness for men..

759
00:55:30,003 --> 00:55:31,971
Men express fondness for men..

760
00:55:32,239 --> 00:55:34,070
The boy wearing the bride's gown..

761
00:55:34,176 --> 00:55:36,644
A mom's dream has been shattered.

762
00:55:38,382 --> 00:55:40,077
Mama's boy has gotten spoilt.

763
00:55:40,385 --> 00:55:42,182
Mama's boy has gotten spoilt.

764
00:55:42,654 --> 00:55:44,383
Mama's boy has gotten spoilt.

765
00:55:44,657 --> 00:55:46,716
Mama's boy has gotten spoilt.

766
00:55:47,027 --> 00:55:48,688
Your son rides the
bride's palanquin.

767
00:55:48,930 --> 00:55:50,727
Alas! You're done for!

768
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,025
Your son rides the
bride's palanquin.

769
00:55:53,169 --> 00:55:54,966
Alas! You're done for!

770
00:56:04,351 --> 00:56:07,218
Hello, everyone.
I have an announcement to make.

771
00:56:07,422 --> 00:56:12,052
I've been asked to be the
new editor-in-chief of Diva.

772
00:56:12,262 --> 00:56:14,696
So let me introduce
you to your new boss..

773
00:56:14,766 --> 00:56:16,996
..the new editor-in-chief of Verve.

774
00:56:17,436 --> 00:56:20,701
Please put your hands together
and give a big warm welcome..

775
00:56:20,775 --> 00:56:23,710
..to your new boss,
Mr. Abhimanyu Singh.

776
00:56:36,730 --> 00:56:38,322
God, he's hot.

777
00:56:49,748 --> 00:56:52,740
Hello, everyone. I'm not
very good with speeches so..

778
00:56:52,820 --> 00:56:56,756
..Lets just take the day off
and get to know each other and..

779
00:56:56,825 --> 00:57:00,886
..also bid farewell
to the one and only M.

780
00:57:37,148 --> 00:57:39,548
Child? What happened?

781
00:57:41,154 --> 00:57:42,382
Did somebody say something?

782
00:57:44,124 --> 00:57:45,182
No, aunty. Nothing.

783
00:57:46,194 --> 00:57:48,025
Then are you practicing how to cry?

784
00:57:52,202 --> 00:57:53,829
Honestly, nothing happened.

785
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:58,503
Okay, then I'll fulfil
this formality by myself.

786
00:57:58,845 --> 00:58:02,906
Why are you crying,
dear? No, I'm not crying.

787
00:58:03,318 --> 00:58:04,444
Something has
happened for sure, dear.

788
00:58:04,586 --> 00:58:06,144
No, aunty. Nothing has happened.

789
00:58:06,589 --> 00:58:08,580
Did somebody say something to you?
- No.

790
00:58:09,861 --> 00:58:10,919
Now, tell me.

791
00:58:13,866 --> 00:58:16,858
I was told that
I'll be given a promotion..

792
00:58:16,937 --> 00:58:21,271
..and then that position
was given to somebody else.

793
00:58:22,612 --> 00:58:24,876
You're so upset over
such a small thing?

794
00:58:25,249 --> 00:58:27,012
I had worked so hard,
you know, aunty..

795
00:58:27,252 --> 00:58:28,879
I had so many plans..

796
00:58:28,954 --> 00:58:30,922
..they gave away the
job just like that.

797
00:58:31,924 --> 00:58:34,256
So, things didn't
happen as per your wishes.

798
00:58:35,096 --> 00:58:37,894
Do you know why? Because
there's something better..

799
00:58:37,967 --> 00:58:42,404
..in your life than this
job and this position.

800
00:58:42,940 --> 00:58:46,068
You won't be able to see
it now, but you will later.

801
00:58:47,647 --> 00:58:50,207
Whatever God does is for the best.

802
00:58:51,518 --> 00:58:53,645
I'm a mother. An expert
on these issues.

803
00:58:55,558 --> 00:58:59,289
Cheer up, dear. I'll make
nice ginger tea for you.

804
00:58:59,664 --> 00:59:02,030
Everything will be fine after that.

805
00:59:03,569 --> 00:59:05,400
Even Sam and Kunal's relationship?

806
00:59:09,611 --> 00:59:14,947
For the past three years,
your son hid the biggest truth..

807
00:59:15,019 --> 00:59:21,219
..of his life from you because he
knew that you wouldn't be pleased.

808
00:59:24,331 --> 00:59:28,233
You'll be happy, but Sam?

809
00:59:31,608 --> 00:59:33,974
If he can lie for your happiness..

810
00:59:34,045 --> 00:59:39,711
..then can't you accept
the truth for his happiness?

811
00:59:43,291 --> 00:59:50,026
Whatever God does is for the best.
Right, aunty? Isn't it?

812
01:00:11,163 --> 01:00:12,653
We'll have to redesign the magazine.

813
01:00:15,069 --> 01:00:16,127
Redesign.

814
01:00:16,304 --> 01:00:18,033
We'll have to present it
in a completely new manner..

815
01:00:18,107 --> 01:00:20,701
..and I want you to take
responsibility for that.

816
01:00:21,611 --> 01:00:22,669
Really?

817
01:00:22,780 --> 01:00:24,771
Because I think that only
you can handle this project.

818
01:00:29,122 --> 01:00:30,180
Okay, thanks.

819
01:00:31,458 --> 01:00:32,652
And one more thing..
- Yes?

820
01:00:32,794 --> 01:00:34,489
We'll launch our new
design with our next issue.

821
01:00:35,131 --> 01:00:36,428
That means you only have two weeks.

822
01:00:37,801 --> 01:00:40,167
Two weeks?! That's not possible.

823
01:00:40,438 --> 01:00:44,101
I know, but if there's
anyone who can do it, it's you.

824
01:00:46,446 --> 01:00:50,382
Okay. I get it.
- What?

825
01:00:51,086 --> 01:00:54,487
You didn't give me this
job because you trust me.

826
01:00:55,726 --> 01:00:58,092
You know that I can't
accomplish this task in two weeks.

827
01:00:58,363 --> 01:01:01,093
In fact, nobody can do it.
And then you'll have a reason..

828
01:01:01,167 --> 01:01:03,635
..to blame me, have me fired. Out!

829
01:01:04,472 --> 01:01:07,600
What?! - I've never seen such an
insecure and cheap person in my life.

830
01:01:09,612 --> 01:01:12,103
You know what?
Mr. Abhimanyu Singh..

831
01:01:12,183 --> 01:01:14,845
..I will not let you win.

832
01:01:47,832 --> 01:01:48,890
Come.

833
01:01:55,843 --> 01:01:56,901
May you live long!

834
01:01:57,913 --> 01:02:01,906
Mom! What are you doing?

835
01:02:04,656 --> 01:02:09,184
Son, forgive me. I couldn't
understand your love.

836
01:02:09,296 --> 01:02:10,558
Mom, I need to tell you something.

837
01:02:10,664 --> 01:02:12,791
Son, what kind of a mother am l?

838
01:02:13,501 --> 01:02:18,768
I prayed for my own
son's sorrows. Sorry.

839
01:02:26,220 --> 01:02:27,278
Oh great!

840
01:02:32,228 --> 01:02:36,528
I had bought these
bangles for my daughter-in-law.

841
01:02:36,634 --> 01:02:38,226
Oh, come on! Are you
really serious, Mom?

842
01:02:38,369 --> 01:02:42,237
Honestly, I don't know whether
you're my daughter-in-law..

843
01:02:42,309 --> 01:02:46,268
..or my son-in-law. But whatever
you are, accept it as a gift from me.

844
01:02:49,252 --> 01:02:54,349
And do observe a fast on
'Karva Chauth' for my son's long life.

845
01:02:54,626 --> 01:02:59,996
Mom! - I'll send you the offerings.
I'm leaving him in your care.

846
01:03:00,934 --> 01:03:02,799
I've brought him up with
a lot of love and care.

847
01:03:03,639 --> 01:03:04,936
Take good care of him.

848
01:03:05,874 --> 01:03:07,865
Now hurry up and seek my blessings.

849
01:03:08,278 --> 01:03:10,269
Come on, Sam. Seek mom's blessings.

850
01:03:12,284 --> 01:03:13,808
He called me mom.

851
01:03:14,287 --> 01:03:15,345
You're sick!

852
01:03:16,357 --> 01:03:21,590
May you live long! May you bear
children. Forget it. - Okay.

853
01:03:24,301 --> 01:03:27,702
Thank you for
bringing me close to my son.

854
01:03:28,907 --> 01:03:32,343
Listen to me. Find a nice
guy and get married.

855
01:03:32,779 --> 01:03:37,409
I'd have chosen you for Sam,
but he's already booked now.

856
01:03:39,322 --> 01:03:42,052
Sam and Kunal can never
be booked for me, aunty.

857
01:03:48,702 --> 01:03:49,862
They will always be mine.

858
01:03:57,080 --> 01:03:58,342
Okay. All right, all right.

859
01:04:14,371 --> 01:04:15,429
Come on, mom.

860
01:04:15,505 --> 01:04:16,563
God bless you, son.

861
01:04:16,741 --> 01:04:18,436
No, I was..
- Don't bother.

862
01:04:18,977 --> 01:04:20,740
Mom, I've to talk to you.

863
01:04:21,414 --> 01:04:23,382
That's the problem.
I agree that you're gay and..

864
01:04:23,451 --> 01:04:25,419
..that you don't have
any interest in girls.

865
01:04:26,121 --> 01:04:28,487
But can't you even see girls?

866
01:04:28,758 --> 01:04:29,816
What?

867
01:04:30,059 --> 01:04:34,758
Fool! Didn't you
notice that Neha was crying?

868
01:04:36,469 --> 01:04:38,130
Check on her and see what's wrong.

869
01:04:39,039 --> 01:04:41,030
Don't worry about me.
I'll go by myself.

870
01:04:41,142 --> 01:04:44,908
I'll call you up when I reach.
God bless you! God bless..

871
01:04:45,982 --> 01:04:47,609
Hello! Flight's on time.

872
01:04:47,751 --> 01:04:49,150
Yes, yes. Come, come.

873
01:04:57,030 --> 01:05:01,524
Your boss said one thing right.
If someone can do this job..

874
01:05:01,604 --> 01:05:02,662
..then it's only you.

875
01:05:04,474 --> 01:05:09,502
Exactly! You just provide the
ideas. He'll click the photos.

876
01:05:11,151 --> 01:05:13,585
And what will you do?
- I'll approve everything.

877
01:05:17,959 --> 01:05:19,483
At least you've smiled.

878
01:05:21,198 --> 01:05:25,601
But this wasn't my plan, you know.
- Plan?!

879
01:05:26,172 --> 01:05:31,940
Yes, my plan for life.
I mean, I'm 27, still single.

880
01:05:32,013 --> 01:05:33,537
My job sucks right now.

881
01:05:33,615 --> 01:05:38,484
My boss hates me and
I live with two hot guys..

882
01:05:38,556 --> 01:05:40,956
..who aren't
interested in me at all.

883
01:05:41,026 --> 01:05:43,017
I mean, that was
definitely not my plan.

884
01:05:44,163 --> 01:05:46,996
Then, what was your plan?

885
01:05:47,768 --> 01:05:52,501
In my plan, I'd have been the
boss of the magazine by now..

886
01:05:52,575 --> 01:05:57,535
..and maybe I'd even be
married to someone like you

887
01:05:59,852 --> 01:06:03,549
That's okay, man. You
had plans. Everybody does.

888
01:06:03,858 --> 01:06:07,555
I did as well. I planned to
be an actor when I grew up.

889
01:06:07,729 --> 01:06:10,664
To have millions of fans who'd take
pictures of me all day and night.

890
01:06:11,034 --> 01:06:12,934
Obviously that didn't happen.

891
01:06:15,274 --> 01:06:16,673
And neither does one
expect them to happen

892
01:06:18,912 --> 01:06:23,076
Childhood dreams
remain dreams. Right, Kunal?

893
01:06:25,187 --> 01:06:27,815
Oh, come on! No way.
Are you serious?

894
01:06:27,958 --> 01:06:29,016
What?

895
01:06:29,093 --> 01:06:30,583
You always wanted to
be a photographer?

896
01:06:30,962 --> 01:06:33,590
My dream came true. I can't help it.

897
01:06:34,066 --> 01:06:36,591
You know what, Neha? Let's go, man.

898
01:06:36,670 --> 01:06:40,071
Because there's no place for losers
like us in his perfect life.

899
01:06:40,175 --> 01:06:45,078
Lets go
to that corner and cry. - Come on!

900
01:06:45,149 --> 01:06:46,207
Come on!

901
01:06:46,284 --> 01:06:48,115
You know, guys. You're right.

902
01:06:49,288 --> 01:06:52,985
I'm happy and my
life is truly perfect.

903
01:06:55,630 --> 01:07:00,192
And that's only because
I have the two of you in my life.

904
01:07:01,939 --> 01:07:05,602
Think about it. Had
you married somebody..

905
01:07:05,678 --> 01:07:11,617
..and you had been
shooting at a beach in Miami..

906
01:07:11,686 --> 01:07:18,649
..then how would we
have met. We three losers?

907
01:07:21,333 --> 01:07:25,633
And whatever said and done,
this friendship is much more..

908
01:07:25,706 --> 01:07:31,042
..rocking than any plan
we might have had. Right?

909
01:07:38,690 --> 01:07:39,850
Kunal!

910
01:07:40,326 --> 01:07:43,659
Dude, that was really good.

911
01:07:43,731 --> 01:07:44,789
Group hug!

912
01:07:52,075 --> 01:07:53,133
Thank you.

913
01:07:54,379 --> 01:07:55,937
Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

914
01:07:57,016 --> 01:07:58,711
Bye, Sam.
- Goodnight.

915
01:07:59,386 --> 01:08:01,217
Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

916
01:08:01,422 --> 01:08:05,324
Listen, I hope he
doesn't fire me from the job.

917
01:08:07,398 --> 01:08:12,734
If he does something like that, then
I'll tell Kunal to break his legs.

918
01:08:13,406 --> 01:08:15,306
When will he put his
muscles to good use, after all?

919
01:08:15,809 --> 01:08:16,867
Chill. It'll be okay.

920
01:08:18,346 --> 01:08:24,182
Sam, love you.
- Sleep well.

921
01:09:24,606 --> 01:09:27,040
Oh, my Lord! Oh, my Lord!

922
01:09:27,277 --> 01:09:29,745
Why is the heart so happy? Why..

923
01:09:30,014 --> 01:09:35,680
Oh, my Lord! Oh, my Lord!

924
01:09:36,423 --> 01:09:39,688
Where is the sky and
where is the earth..

925
01:09:39,761 --> 01:09:43,424
I don't know. I don't know.

926
01:09:43,566 --> 01:09:47,627
Since my beloved arrived,
I've lost control of myself.

927
01:09:47,772 --> 01:09:50,741
I don't know..

928
01:09:51,611 --> 01:09:54,774
I've lost my senses.

929
01:09:55,383 --> 01:09:56,441
I built my castle of dreams.

930
01:09:56,518 --> 01:09:57,576
When did I open my eyes..

931
01:09:57,652 --> 01:10:00,587
I don't know. I don't know.

932
01:10:00,790 --> 01:10:04,658
Where is the sky and
where is the earth..

933
01:10:04,796 --> 01:10:07,788
I don't know. I don't know.

934
01:10:08,100 --> 01:10:10,660
Oh, my Lord! Oh, my Lord!

935
01:10:10,804 --> 01:10:13,637
Why is the heart so happy? Why..

936
01:10:13,776 --> 01:10:19,214
Oh, my Lord! Oh, my Lord!

937
01:10:19,417 --> 01:10:21,112
Got to be love..

938
01:10:21,787 --> 01:10:23,721
Got to be love..

939
01:10:24,090 --> 01:10:26,217
Got to be love..

940
01:10:26,827 --> 01:10:28,818
It's got to be love.

941
01:10:29,130 --> 01:10:30,825
Got to be love..

942
01:10:31,100 --> 01:10:33,125
'Because it's really got me going.

943
01:10:33,503 --> 01:10:34,731
It's got me going.

944
01:10:34,805 --> 01:10:36,705
Got to be love..

945
01:10:36,841 --> 01:10:38,502
'Because it's really got me going.

946
01:10:39,678 --> 01:10:44,638
How, when and where
did I become yours.

947
01:10:44,852 --> 01:10:50,188
I was lost in thought
while I fell in love.

948
01:10:50,259 --> 01:10:53,126
My dreams, my
heart and my breath..

949
01:10:53,197 --> 01:10:55,631
..caused such a flutter..

950
01:10:55,767 --> 01:11:00,602
This has happened many
times when I've looked at you.

951
01:11:01,509 --> 01:11:05,343
If you wish, this heart
shall always remain yours.

952
01:11:05,547 --> 01:11:10,416
What else do I say?
I don't know. I don't know.

953
01:11:10,822 --> 01:11:14,758
Where is the sky and
where is the earth?

954
01:11:14,894 --> 01:11:18,193
I don't know. I don't know.

955
01:11:18,333 --> 01:11:20,699
Oh, my Lord! Oh, my Lord!

956
01:11:20,870 --> 01:11:23,304
Why is the heart so happy? Why..

957
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:29,345
Oh, my Lord! Oh, my Lord!

958
01:11:29,648 --> 01:11:33,584
Where is the sky and
where is the earth?

959
01:11:33,654 --> 01:11:36,782
I don't know. I don't know.

960
01:11:37,225 --> 01:11:42,595
Since my beloved arrived,
I've lost control of myself.

961
01:11:42,733 --> 01:11:45,258
I don't know..

962
01:11:45,403 --> 01:11:46,597
I've lost my senses.

963
01:11:46,739 --> 01:11:48,331
I built my castle of dreams.

964
01:11:48,475 --> 01:11:50,739
When did I open my eyes..

965
01:11:50,811 --> 01:11:54,269
I don't know. I don't know.

966
01:11:54,550 --> 01:11:58,680
Where is the sky and
where is the earth?

967
01:11:58,756 --> 01:12:01,691
I don't know. I don't know.

968
01:12:01,835 --> 01:12:03,234
Got to be love..

969
01:12:03,371 --> 01:12:05,464
Because it's really got me going.

970
01:12:05,741 --> 01:12:07,231
It's got me going.

971
01:12:07,309 --> 01:12:08,571
Got to be love..

972
01:12:08,712 --> 01:12:10,577
Because it's really got me going.

973
01:12:10,715 --> 01:12:12,444
It's got me going.

974
01:12:12,583 --> 01:12:14,175
Got to be love..

975
01:12:14,253 --> 01:12:15,845
Because it's really got me going.

976
01:12:16,456 --> 01:12:17,753
It's got me going.

977
01:12:17,824 --> 01:12:18,916
Got to be love..

978
01:12:19,193 --> 01:12:21,218
Because it's really got me going.

979
01:12:21,363 --> 01:12:25,197
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'd like you all to meet..

980
01:12:25,268 --> 01:12:28,203
..the man of the hour.
Please give a big hand to our..

981
01:12:28,273 --> 01:12:31,401
..new chief editor,
Mr. Abhimanyu Singh.

982
01:12:34,481 --> 01:12:37,939
He shall arrive in this wait..

983
01:12:38,654 --> 01:12:42,920
My heart floats away to the
place which my dreams reveal.

984
01:12:44,828 --> 01:12:48,491
It feels like he's near me.

985
01:12:48,935 --> 01:12:53,872
Why is it so?
My eyes eagerly search for him.

986
01:12:54,842 --> 01:12:55,968
I've lost my senses.

987
01:12:56,245 --> 01:12:58,975
I built my castle of dreams.

988
01:12:59,249 --> 01:13:01,683
When did I open my eyes..

989
01:13:01,919 --> 01:13:04,319
I don't know..

990
01:13:04,523 --> 01:13:06,514
Where is the sky and
where is the earth?

991
01:13:06,659 --> 01:13:11,722
I don't know. I don't know.

992
01:13:11,967 --> 01:13:17,906
Since my beloved arrived,
I've lost control of myself.

993
01:13:17,976 --> 01:13:19,341
I don't know..

994
01:13:19,877 --> 01:13:21,344
I've lost my senses.

995
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:24,005
I built my castle of dreams.

996
01:13:24,284 --> 01:13:25,683
When did I open my eyes..

997
01:13:25,753 --> 01:13:29,018
I don't know. I don't know.

998
01:13:29,391 --> 01:13:33,487
Where is the sky and
where is the earth..

999
01:13:33,564 --> 01:13:35,691
I don't know. I don't know.

1000
01:13:35,767 --> 01:13:38,497
Good evening, everyone.
Thank you for being here tonight.

1001
01:13:39,905 --> 01:13:44,342
I'd like to introduce all of you
to someone who is very special.

1002
01:13:44,412 --> 01:13:47,313
Someone who's truly and
entirely responsible..

1003
01:13:47,383 --> 01:13:48,441
..for our success tonight.

1004
01:13:50,020 --> 01:13:54,389
Ladies and gentlemen,
Ms. Neha Melwani.

1005
01:14:23,067 --> 01:14:25,592
Oh, my Lord! Oh, my Lord!

1006
01:14:25,804 --> 01:14:28,102
Why is the heart so happy? Why..

1007
01:14:28,374 --> 01:14:30,808
Oh, my Lord! Oh, my Lord!

1008
01:14:31,044 --> 01:14:34,303
Oh, my Lord!

1009
01:15:02,079 --> 01:15:03,876
I'm sorry I dropped your ice cream.

1010
01:15:07,119 --> 01:15:09,553
Okay. How about
I buy you another one?

1011
01:15:12,060 --> 01:15:15,223
Please, please.
- Alright.

1012
01:15:16,032 --> 01:15:17,090
Okay.

1013
01:15:22,107 --> 01:15:23,699
What's your name?
- Veer.

1014
01:15:23,776 --> 01:15:24,834
What's your name?

1015
01:15:24,912 --> 01:15:27,244
My name is Neha.
- Thank you.

1016
01:15:28,116 --> 01:15:34,180
Thank you. Here you go.
- Okay, bye.

1017
01:15:55,154 --> 01:15:57,281
I didn't know that you were married.

1018
01:15:58,892 --> 01:16:02,953
I was. Not anymore. She left us.

1019
01:16:05,635 --> 01:16:09,628
I'm really sorry, Abhi.
I didn't realise.. I had no idea.

1020
01:16:09,908 --> 01:16:11,239
I didn't mean that she passed away

1021
01:16:12,145 --> 01:16:16,206
She left me for somebody else.
- Oh!

1022
01:16:17,185 --> 01:16:22,646
After Nisha left, I had to
ask my mom to stay with us.

1023
01:16:25,163 --> 01:16:27,996
At that point of time,
I needed her more than Veer.

1024
01:16:30,937 --> 01:16:32,871
But even she left us
a few months back.

1025
01:16:34,075 --> 01:16:35,133
For whom?

1026
01:16:39,215 --> 01:16:41,274
It's okay.
- I'm sorry.

1027
01:16:53,035 --> 01:16:55,936
Hello!
- Sam! - Hello!

1028
01:16:56,006 --> 01:17:00,238
Sam, guess what! I've been given
a big project to shoot. - Wow!

1029
01:17:00,312 --> 01:17:02,041
I know. I've to got go to
Philadelphia for the shoot today.

1030
01:17:02,115 --> 01:17:03,377
I'll be back tomorrow.

1031
01:17:03,850 --> 01:17:06,114
I'll be back tomorrow.
- You're leaving,

1032
01:17:06,988 --> 01:17:11,391
Don't go. - Sam, the food is
in the fridge, tell Neha also.

1033
01:17:11,727 --> 01:17:15,390
Ok. I'll miss you, my jiggereypoo.
- Bye, Sam. - Bye.

1034
01:17:25,013 --> 01:17:27,174
Ya hi! Neha Melwani, please.

1035
01:17:27,250 --> 01:17:30,185
Its a surprise, Neha.
Wait for two minutes.

1036
01:17:30,888 --> 01:17:34,016
Oh! But you can surprise me
without all this too, you know Sam.

1037
01:17:34,092 --> 01:17:35,150
Nope.

1038
01:17:39,032 --> 01:17:40,363
Right here.
- Okay.

1039
01:17:41,302 --> 01:17:44,066
Ready?
- Yes, please.

1040
01:17:49,781 --> 01:17:54,445
3-2-1..

1041
01:18:00,196 --> 01:18:01,254
Wow!

1042
01:18:01,330 --> 01:18:02,388
Surprised?

1043
01:18:06,304 --> 01:18:07,362
Yes!

1044
01:18:08,240 --> 01:18:09,298
Well, it's all yours.

1045
01:18:12,747 --> 01:18:13,805
Okay.

1046
01:18:55,139 --> 01:18:58,802
I want to give you something.
So that when you're 90 years old..

1047
01:18:58,877 --> 01:19:02,813
..and you've lost your memory,
you can't see clearly..

1048
01:19:02,883 --> 01:19:06,819
..you're hard of
hearing and basically..

1049
01:19:06,889 --> 01:19:11,826
..be alone then..

1050
01:19:11,896 --> 01:19:17,198
..then this will be
extremely useful to you.

1051
01:19:19,407 --> 01:19:21,068
Do you know why?
- Why?

1052
01:19:22,377 --> 01:19:26,837
Because it contains
every moment, every second..

1053
01:19:26,917 --> 01:19:31,911
..that I've spent
with my dearest friend.

1054
01:19:37,365 --> 01:19:39,856
I call it my Sam and Neha diary.

1055
01:19:43,406 --> 01:19:47,866
The first time you cooked for me..

1056
01:19:47,946 --> 01:19:53,111
..I enjoyed eating it.
And then I ate something else..

1057
01:19:54,890 --> 01:19:55,948
Digestive pills.

1058
01:19:56,024 --> 01:19:57,082
Sam!

1059
01:20:01,232 --> 01:20:05,601
The first time we went for a walk.
- I remember that.

1060
01:20:08,475 --> 01:20:11,967
We gazed at the sunset and
then at the moonlit night.

1061
01:20:13,348 --> 01:20:16,647
By the way, you were
looking very pretty that night.

1062
01:20:23,597 --> 01:20:24,655
Sam!

1063
01:20:25,432 --> 01:20:31,667
Our first moments of joy,
moments of laughter..

1064
01:20:34,011 --> 01:20:37,003
And then our first time in the rain.

1065
01:20:55,307 --> 01:20:58,970
You know what? This is
the most beautiful moment..

1066
01:20:59,046 --> 01:21:03,710
..in Sam and Neha's diary.

1067
01:21:07,491 --> 01:21:09,459
But here..
- Smile.

1068
01:21:14,001 --> 01:21:18,597
Sam, it's perfect.

1069
01:21:23,414 --> 01:21:24,472
Thank you.

1070
01:21:36,098 --> 01:21:37,463
Okay, let's go
through the book. Okay.

1071
01:22:08,343 --> 01:22:11,141
Co-chief editor, congrats.

1072
01:22:17,656 --> 01:22:19,590
This should've happened long back.

1073
01:22:28,538 --> 01:22:29,596
Have they just
given you a promotion..

1074
01:22:29,673 --> 01:22:31,163
..or will they increase
your pay as well? - Of course.

1075
01:22:32,110 --> 01:22:33,236
Here's your size, sir.

1076
01:22:33,312 --> 01:22:35,109
Thank you. Guys, I'm just coming.

1077
01:22:35,514 --> 01:22:39,109
Hey! I really like that.
Think I should try it on?

1078
01:22:39,186 --> 01:22:40,676
Yes. - Ok.

1079
01:22:50,669 --> 01:22:51,727
Neha!

1080
01:22:54,741 --> 01:22:56,606
Neha!
- Sam!

1081
01:23:05,757 --> 01:23:08,624
Neha, I want to tell you something.

1082
01:23:13,801 --> 01:23:15,769
It's just that..

1083
01:23:19,776 --> 01:23:23,234
I've been feeling Differently
towards you for the last few days.

1084
01:23:23,315 --> 01:23:24,373
Sam!

1085
01:23:25,785 --> 01:23:29,186
Just let me speak,
okay? Just one minute..

1086
01:23:31,760 --> 01:23:37,528
Whenever I'm with you,
I feel something different.

1087
01:23:37,601 --> 01:23:38,659
Sam.

1088
01:23:38,736 --> 01:23:41,466
I know. I know you're
going to say that I'm gay.

1089
01:23:42,541 --> 01:23:50,346
But just suppose..
suppose I wasn't gay. Then..

1090
01:23:50,420 --> 01:23:51,478
What would you have said?

1091
01:23:51,554 --> 01:23:52,612
Sam..

1092
01:23:52,689 --> 01:23:54,554
What'd you have said
other than my name, Neha?

1093
01:23:54,692 --> 01:23:56,557
Sam.
- Neha.

1094
01:23:57,562 --> 01:23:58,824
Sam.
- Neha.

1095
01:23:59,832 --> 01:24:02,232
Sam! What's wrong with you?!

1096
01:24:02,302 --> 01:24:03,360
Neha?!

1097
01:24:04,305 --> 01:24:05,363
Kunal?!

1098
01:24:06,308 --> 01:24:07,832
You love Neha?
- Yes, so?

1099
01:24:07,911 --> 01:24:09,242
No, you can't.
- Why?

1100
01:24:09,312 --> 01:24:10,370
Because I love Neha.

1101
01:24:10,448 --> 01:24:11,745
Guys, what are you doing?

1102
01:24:16,322 --> 01:24:17,721
You guys are getting
out of here right now.

1103
01:24:17,791 --> 01:24:18,849
This is so embarrassing, you know?

1104
01:24:18,926 --> 01:24:19,984
One minute.

1105
01:24:21,596 --> 01:24:22,790
Since when have you
been in love with Neha?

1106
01:24:22,865 --> 01:24:24,332
What do you mean since when?
Is there a time limit to it?

1107
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:25,867
Yes, offer open
only till stocks last.

1108
01:24:25,936 --> 01:24:28,632
Exactly. And Neha is
single now. So the sale is on!

1109
01:24:28,706 --> 01:24:30,731
Hey! This isn't a 'buy one
and get one free' scheme.

1110
01:24:30,809 --> 01:24:32,777
I came here before you,
so I'll tell her first.

1111
01:24:34,281 --> 01:24:35,407
That's it. That's it.

1112
01:24:39,888 --> 01:24:42,982
Disgusting! Disgusting behaviour!

1113
01:24:43,827 --> 01:24:47,524
No, no. Saw that? She hates you.

1114
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:50,296
Yes? And if she'd
heard what you had to say..

1115
01:24:50,370 --> 01:24:52,304
..then she'd have hated you
even more and more than that..

1116
01:24:52,372 --> 01:24:54,499
..she'll throw us out of the house.

1117
01:24:54,842 --> 01:24:57,037
So what, man?! Let her
throw us out. I don't care.

1118
01:24:57,647 --> 01:24:58,841
If I worry about that then I'll
never be able to tell her that..

1119
01:24:58,915 --> 01:24:59,973
..I love her.

1120
01:25:00,051 --> 01:25:02,611
No you can't because
no house equals no Neha.

1121
01:25:02,688 --> 01:25:03,746
You got it?

1122
01:25:06,392 --> 01:25:07,450
What do we do now?

1123
01:25:09,931 --> 01:25:12,399
Hey Sam, it's Neha's
birthday tomorrow.

1124
01:25:12,902 --> 01:25:15,393
I'm planning something
special for her.

1125
01:25:15,472 --> 01:25:18,407
I know a new place,
its really cool

1126
01:25:18,676 --> 01:25:20,473
After work I'll pick her
up and bring her there.

1127
01:25:20,913 --> 01:25:22,778
Meet us there by 9 sharp.

1128
01:25:23,950 --> 01:25:26,475
Enough is enough, Kunal.
Tell me, where are we going?

1129
01:25:26,554 --> 01:25:28,886
Nothing special.
Just dinner and a movie.

1130
01:25:31,694 --> 01:25:33,719
Where is Sam?
- Sam had some important work.

1131
01:25:50,988 --> 01:25:59,987
Kunal! Neha!

1132
01:26:25,970 --> 01:26:27,130
Kunal!

1133
01:26:28,641 --> 01:26:33,044
Wow! Kunal, I mean.. I must say,
it's a beautiful surprise.

1134
01:26:33,114 --> 01:26:34,172
It's fantastic.

1135
01:26:42,461 --> 01:26:43,519
What's this?

1136
01:26:44,797 --> 01:26:46,196
Will you have dinner with me?

1137
01:26:51,005 --> 01:26:52,063
Sure.

1138
01:27:44,013 --> 01:27:47,107
'Kuch Kuch Hota
Hai,' my favourite movie.

1139
01:27:47,184 --> 01:27:48,549
How do you know that?

1140
01:27:48,619 --> 01:27:49,677
Do you like it?

1141
01:27:50,055 --> 01:27:54,890
Are you kidding? I love it.
Oh it's perfect!

1142
01:27:54,962 --> 01:27:57,021
Come, let's go.

1143
01:28:10,784 --> 01:28:11,944
Just like her father.

1144
01:28:34,084 --> 01:28:35,142
What happened?

1145
01:28:42,629 --> 01:28:43,687
No music.

1146
01:30:23,102 --> 01:30:30,031
Hey, Kunal! What an idea!
You should've seen his face.

1147
01:30:30,346 --> 01:30:35,079
You were right. He gave a lot of
pleasure to my kitty party group.

1148
01:30:35,153 --> 01:30:36,279
This was your idea?!

1149
01:30:37,322 --> 01:30:38,380
What?

1150
01:30:40,393 --> 01:30:41,451
What?! You think it's funny?

1151
01:30:41,996 --> 01:30:43,861
Listen, Sam. Relax.

1152
01:30:43,932 --> 01:30:45,866
Relax?!
- Sam.

1153
01:30:50,340 --> 01:30:51,398
Kunal!

1154
01:30:58,318 --> 01:30:59,478
What's wrong with you guys?

1155
01:31:03,325 --> 01:31:08,126
If there's a problem
then we can talk about it.

1156
01:31:27,326 --> 01:31:29,920
They crossed the limit last night.
They were fighting.

1157
01:31:29,996 --> 01:31:31,088
Actually, hitting each other.

1158
01:31:33,067 --> 01:31:34,534
I mean, there's a
solution to everything.

1159
01:31:35,203 --> 01:31:36,261
What's the need to get violent?

1160
01:31:36,405 --> 01:31:38,202
Can you.. can you
just say something?

1161
01:31:38,274 --> 01:31:41,038
Please, I want to
play on my Play-station.

1162
01:31:45,417 --> 01:31:47,009
Veer. Veer!

1163
01:31:47,454 --> 01:31:54,553
Neha, I was
wondering if.. actually I'm..

1164
01:31:55,231 --> 01:32:00,100
I have invites to a party
tonight and if you wish..

1165
01:32:00,171 --> 01:32:01,229
I'd love to.

1166
01:32:04,244 --> 01:32:08,908
Oh no! I promised Sam and Kunal..

1167
01:32:08,984 --> 01:32:12,420
..that I'll take them out
so that they can chat..

1168
01:32:12,489 --> 01:32:14,480
..and sort out everything.

1169
01:32:14,558 --> 01:32:17,925
That's okay. Bring them along.
They can chat and maybe..

1170
01:32:17,996 --> 01:32:21,989
..the two of us as well.

1171
01:32:23,471 --> 01:32:25,666
Sounds good. You're sure, right?

1172
01:32:26,275 --> 01:32:27,674
Yeah!
- Okay.

1173
01:32:28,545 --> 01:32:31,013
10pm. The Delano.

1174
01:32:38,024 --> 01:32:40,959
Hello, ladies and
gentlemen and welcome here, to..

1175
01:32:41,029 --> 01:32:43,293
..the inaugural
children's charity event auction.

1176
01:32:43,366 --> 01:32:45,698
We've got some amazing
works of art here tonight.

1177
01:32:46,170 --> 01:32:48,968
The work you can see
over to my left is a piece..

1178
01:32:49,040 --> 01:32:51,440
..by the renowned
artist Humphrey Bovedink.

1179
01:32:51,510 --> 01:32:55,446
No, no, don't worry.
Sam and Kunal are with me.

1180
01:32:55,516 --> 01:33:00,044
You take your time,
Okay, bye. I'll see you.

1181
01:33:00,122 --> 01:33:06,061
..after the rigor mortis wore
off they flopped down to his sides.

1182
01:33:06,331 --> 01:33:08,993
This is an amazing piece of
art if we can start the bidding..

1183
01:33:09,068 --> 01:33:12,333
..right now, tonight.. at 2000.
2000! 2000! Do I have 2000?

1184
01:33:12,406 --> 01:33:15,398
Yes, we've got 2000
over there. 3000! 3000!

1185
01:33:15,478 --> 01:33:17,002
Any takers for 3000?

1186
01:33:17,079 --> 01:33:20,412
Thank you. 4000.
4000. Anybody for 4000?

1187
01:33:20,485 --> 01:33:21,747
All right. Guys, what's the problem?

1188
01:33:24,356 --> 01:33:26,620
Stop it. How long are you
going to keep fighting like this?

1189
01:33:26,693 --> 01:33:29,184
Talk to each other, just
spell it out, sort it out.

1190
01:33:31,566 --> 01:33:33,625
Fine. Kunal, you tell me.
I'll solve the problem.

1191
01:33:33,703 --> 01:33:34,761
Just tell me.

1192
01:33:36,540 --> 01:33:38,633
Do you want to know?
- Yes.

1193
01:33:38,710 --> 01:33:40,041
Do you really want to know?
- Yes, Sam.

1194
01:33:40,111 --> 01:33:41,169
I really want to know.

1195
01:33:41,247 --> 01:33:45,115
Fine. There's somebody
else in Kunal's life.

1196
01:33:45,185 --> 01:33:46,243
What?!
- What?!

1197
01:33:46,320 --> 01:33:47,651
3500. Thank you very much, sir.

1198
01:33:48,123 --> 01:33:49,590
He is cheating on me, the dog!

1199
01:33:49,658 --> 01:33:51,785
With whom?
- Rustom.

1200
01:33:52,529 --> 01:33:53,587
Rustom?
- Who's that?

1201
01:33:53,664 --> 01:33:55,131
His personal trainer.
- Mine?

1202
01:33:55,534 --> 01:33:56,592
Is this true, Kunal?

1203
01:33:56,668 --> 01:33:58,659
Yes, it is true.
Why are you asking him? Ask me.

1204
01:34:00,641 --> 01:34:03,075
Do you know that everyday
when he returns from the gym..

1205
01:34:03,144 --> 01:34:07,137
..I ask him so lovingly
if he worked out a lot.

1206
01:34:07,216 --> 01:34:08,683
And do you know what he replies?
- What?

1207
01:34:08,752 --> 01:34:12,153
Today, I did 1 00
pull-ups and 200 push-ups.

1208
01:34:12,657 --> 01:34:16,149
Now I know whom he was
doing his push-ups on.

1209
01:34:16,229 --> 01:34:17,287
I'm so sorry.

1210
01:34:18,165 --> 01:34:20,565
4000. 4000. Thank you.

1211
01:34:20,635 --> 01:34:21,693
Need a hug..
- I'm so sorry.

1212
01:34:21,770 --> 01:34:22,828
This is a lie.

1213
01:34:22,905 --> 01:34:24,099
No, it's true.

1214
01:34:24,574 --> 01:34:27,441
The truth is that
he can't do anything

1215
01:34:27,511 --> 01:34:28,569
What?!

1216
01:34:28,646 --> 01:34:29,840
What?!
- No.

1217
01:34:29,914 --> 01:34:31,609
4500. Thank you very much, madam.

1218
01:34:31,684 --> 01:34:32,742
Yes!
- Yes. No!

1219
01:34:32,819 --> 01:34:36,414
He's incapable, Neha. I've never
told this to anybody before this.

1220
01:34:37,659 --> 01:34:41,117
But I stood by him at
every step in life..

1221
01:34:41,197 --> 01:34:45,327
..and what did he give me
in return?

1222
01:34:45,403 --> 01:34:46,631
All I got was suspicion.

1223
01:34:48,474 --> 01:34:50,442
5000. Thank you very much, sir.

1224
01:34:50,711 --> 01:34:54,147
Oh yeah! Come outside
I'll clear your doubts

1225
01:34:54,215 --> 01:34:55,807
And I'll show you Rustom.
- Yes. - Yes.

1226
01:34:55,885 --> 01:34:57,216
Come on. Let's do it, man.
Come on!

1227
01:34:57,286 --> 01:34:58,685
Yes! Come on!
- Come on!

1228
01:35:10,739 --> 01:35:12,206
Oh! Jesus!

1229
01:35:14,710 --> 01:35:15,904
We should go.
- Okay.

1230
01:35:16,713 --> 01:35:18,305
Where are you going?

1231
01:35:18,516 --> 01:35:21,576
It was him.

1232
01:35:21,654 --> 01:35:23,178
Ladies and gentlemen,
there has been..

1233
01:35:23,256 --> 01:35:24,780
..a slight change in lot number one.

1234
01:35:24,858 --> 01:35:27,190
What we are offering you here at
this children's charity event..

1235
01:35:27,261 --> 01:35:29,923
..is an adults-only,
one night special.

1236
01:35:30,533 --> 01:35:35,266
A night of absolute debauchery
with these two gentlemen over here.

1237
01:35:40,280 --> 01:35:44,740
We're going to start the
bidding for both of them at $400.

1238
01:35:46,422 --> 01:35:49,949
400. Do I hear $400?

1239
01:35:52,297 --> 01:35:55,858
$1 0.
- $1 0?

1240
01:35:56,803 --> 01:36:01,297
Right, $1 0. Then could we have $20?

1241
01:36:01,376 --> 01:36:02,570
Come on, baby.
Take it off. Take it off.

1242
01:37:10,907 --> 01:37:12,340
$5000!

1243
01:37:12,409 --> 01:37:16,641
5000! Sold to the beautiful,
beautiful woman over there.

1244
01:37:27,697 --> 01:37:29,722
Nobody else has a right over
the two of you.

1245
01:37:31,569 --> 01:37:32,627
You belong to me.

1246
01:37:38,479 --> 01:37:47,979
My Indian girl, my Indian girl..

1247
01:37:49,061 --> 01:37:55,523
My Indian girl, my Indian girl..

1248
01:37:55,603 --> 01:37:57,434
Drop your earrings..

1249
01:37:57,506 --> 01:38:02,739
If your eyes meet hers,
then you shall melt.

1250
01:38:04,549 --> 01:38:06,414
Dance to the beats..

1251
01:38:06,486 --> 01:38:11,753
Everybody's heartbeat
matches your steps.

1252
01:38:12,594 --> 01:38:16,155
Sways her body and lays the trap.

1253
01:38:16,232 --> 01:38:19,565
Makes the heart grow restless.

1254
01:38:19,637 --> 01:38:23,038
Every Romeo agrees they
have never seen such a girl.

1255
01:38:23,108 --> 01:38:26,043
They have never seen such a girl.

1256
01:38:26,112 --> 01:38:29,604
I've seen millions of other girls.

1257
01:38:29,684 --> 01:38:33,279
There isn't anybody
like my Indian girl.

1258
01:38:33,356 --> 01:38:37,053
I've seen a million other girls..

1259
01:38:37,128 --> 01:38:40,791
..but the prettiest among
them is my Indian girl.

1260
01:38:40,866 --> 01:38:43,130
Who's the hottest
girl in the world?

1261
01:38:43,203 --> 01:38:47,606
My Indian girl, my Indian girl..

1262
01:38:47,676 --> 01:38:51,134
With her grooves,
she'll rock your world.

1263
01:38:51,215 --> 01:38:54,651
My Indian girl, my Indian girl..

1264
01:39:13,713 --> 01:39:20,642
My Indian girl, my Indian girl..

1265
01:39:21,657 --> 01:39:28,688
If you look at her hips sway,
it will add colour to your dreams.

1266
01:39:29,135 --> 01:39:35,597
When she holds their hands,
her lovers die smiling.

1267
01:39:35,676 --> 01:39:42,411
Search wherever you'd like,
but you won't find such a girl.

1268
01:39:42,486 --> 01:39:45,751
I've seen millions of other girls.

1269
01:39:45,824 --> 01:39:49,351
There isn't anybody
like my Indian girl.

1270
01:39:49,429 --> 01:39:53,160
I've seen a million other girls..

1271
01:39:53,234 --> 01:39:56,897
..but the prettiest among
them is my Indian girl.

1272
01:39:57,507 --> 01:39:59,839
Who's the hottest
girl in the world?

1273
01:40:00,244 --> 01:40:03,509
My Indian girl, my Indian girl..

1274
01:40:03,583 --> 01:40:07,246
With her grooves,
she'll rock your world.

1275
01:40:07,321 --> 01:40:10,518
My Indian girl, my Indian girl..

1276
01:40:10,592 --> 01:40:16,360
My Indian girl, my Indian girl..

1277
01:40:37,697 --> 01:40:44,569
Wherever I go,
every eye follows me.

1278
01:40:44,773 --> 01:40:51,440
Wherever I pause,
so do a million heartbeats.

1279
01:40:51,516 --> 01:40:55,247
Everybody's eyes told me
that they've seen a girl..

1280
01:40:55,321 --> 01:40:58,313
..Like me, only in their dreams.

1281
01:40:58,393 --> 01:40:59,860
A girl like me!

1282
01:40:59,928 --> 01:41:03,591
I've seen millions of other girls.

1283
01:41:03,667 --> 01:41:07,000
There isn't anybody
like an Indian girl.

1284
01:41:07,605 --> 01:41:10,631
I've seen a million other girls..

1285
01:41:10,710 --> 01:41:14,271
..but the prettiest among
them is my Indian girl.

1286
01:41:14,615 --> 01:41:17,778
Who's the hottest
girl in the world?

1287
01:41:17,853 --> 01:41:21,345
My Indian girl, my Indian girl..

1288
01:41:21,425 --> 01:41:24,690
With our grooves,
she'll rock your world.

1289
01:41:24,763 --> 01:41:28,563
My Indian girl, Indian girl..

1290
01:41:29,503 --> 01:41:31,368
Drop your earrings..

1291
01:41:31,439 --> 01:41:36,376
If your eyes meet hers,
then you shall melt.

1292
01:41:38,382 --> 01:41:40,316
Dance to the beats..

1293
01:41:40,384 --> 01:41:45,321
Everybody's heartbeat
matches your steps.

1294
01:41:46,393 --> 01:41:49,851
Sways her body and lays the trap.

1295
01:41:49,931 --> 01:41:53,389
Makes the heart grow restless.

1296
01:41:53,470 --> 01:41:57,338
Every Romeo agrees that they
have never seen such a girl.

1297
01:41:57,408 --> 01:41:59,342
They have never seen such a girl.

1298
01:41:59,945 --> 01:42:03,574
I've seen millions of other girls.

1299
01:42:03,651 --> 01:42:07,087
There isn't anybody
like my Indian girl.

1300
01:42:07,422 --> 01:42:10,687
I've seen a million other girls..

1301
01:42:10,761 --> 01:42:14,561
..but the prettiest among
them is my Indian girl.

1302
01:42:14,632 --> 01:42:17,760
Who's the hottest
girl in the world?

1303
01:42:17,838 --> 01:42:21,433
My Indian girl, my Indian girl..

1304
01:42:21,709 --> 01:42:24,769
With her grooves,
she'll rock your world.

1305
01:42:24,847 --> 01:42:28,442
My Indian girl, my Indian girl..

1306
01:42:28,519 --> 01:42:29,577
Who is that?

1307
01:42:30,389 --> 01:42:31,447
Neha's boss.

1308
01:42:33,726 --> 01:42:35,557
It seems her boss
wants to toss us out.

1309
01:42:36,830 --> 01:42:37,888
What do we do now?

1310
01:42:40,469 --> 01:42:43,438
Whatever we do,
we'll do it together.

1311
01:43:11,779 --> 01:43:13,610
Surprise!

1312
01:43:15,017 --> 01:43:16,780
Surprise! Dude, what's up?
- Huh?

1313
01:43:16,853 --> 01:43:17,911
Didn't you recognise me?
It's me. Kunal.

1314
01:43:17,988 --> 01:43:19,046
Neha's friend and roommate.

1315
01:43:19,123 --> 01:43:20,181
And I'm Sam.

1316
01:43:20,525 --> 01:43:22,516
Dude, what a house?! Awesome!

1317
01:43:22,595 --> 01:43:24,460
Yes, man. I hope you
don't have a problem.

1318
01:43:24,530 --> 01:43:26,464
We thought that
you're Neha's friend..

1319
01:43:26,533 --> 01:43:28,467
..and Neha's our friend.
They're all our friends..

1320
01:43:28,536 --> 01:43:30,731
..so everybody's
your friend. Cool? Cool!

1321
01:43:30,806 --> 01:43:31,966
Guys, let's have a party!

1322
01:43:34,077 --> 01:43:35,635
Don't be shy, buddy. Feel at home.

1323
01:43:36,047 --> 01:43:37,605
Dude, what do you think of Neha?

1324
01:43:37,816 --> 01:43:41,217
Neha. Neha is the
prettiest girl on the planet.

1325
01:43:41,554 --> 01:43:44,648
The loveliest. She's funny,
good looking, a little crazy.

1326
01:43:45,560 --> 01:43:46,618
Weren't you about to say this?

1327
01:43:46,695 --> 01:43:48,629
That's the problem.
You don't say anything.

1328
01:43:49,065 --> 01:43:50,225
Say something, buddy.

1329
01:43:52,570 --> 01:43:55,505
He's a shy fellow. No problem.

1330
01:43:55,841 --> 01:43:57,968
Don't worry. We'll say
whatever is to be said.

1331
01:43:58,044 --> 01:44:00,512
After all, they're all your friends.
You're Neha's friend. - Yes.

1332
01:44:00,581 --> 01:44:01,639
Neha's our friend?
- Exactly.

1333
01:44:01,716 --> 01:44:02,842
We will have to help you
- Yes, sounds like a deal.

1334
01:44:04,052 --> 01:44:07,078
So Neha, why do you like Abhi?

1335
01:44:07,156 --> 01:44:08,248
I think he's just about okay.

1336
01:44:08,592 --> 01:44:10,924
What?! Please! He's totally cool.

1337
01:44:10,996 --> 01:44:12,258
You look like a crazy fool.

1338
01:44:13,099 --> 01:44:16,159
Really? But it's an Armani, dude.

1339
01:44:16,236 --> 01:44:19,000
It is? Oh I see so you're willing
to sacrifice all of Neha's wishes..

1340
01:44:19,073 --> 01:44:20,540
..just for your Armani.

1341
01:44:28,620 --> 01:44:30,281
Bye, guys. I'm going. That's him.

1342
01:44:46,178 --> 01:44:51,275
He's not like most guys today
who think about just one thing.

1343
01:44:53,922 --> 01:44:54,980
What?

1344
01:44:55,058 --> 01:44:56,787
You have to do it.

1345
01:44:59,931 --> 01:45:01,330
No, I can't do it.

1346
01:45:04,070 --> 01:45:06,129
Why? No 'ting-tong'
in your 'ding-dong'?

1347
01:45:07,809 --> 01:45:10,676
I heard that you
like red wine a lot?

1348
01:45:12,148 --> 01:45:14,673
Yes, who told you?

1349
01:45:15,686 --> 01:45:20,623
Whoever told me also told me that
you get very naughty..

1350
01:45:20,693 --> 01:45:25,858
..after drinking red wine.

1351
01:45:27,637 --> 01:45:31,232
Shall I tell you something naughty?
Don't laugh, okay?

1352
01:45:31,308 --> 01:45:32,707
Okay.
- Promise? - Sure.

1353
01:45:34,178 --> 01:45:36,305
I think his chest hair is so sexy.

1354
01:45:44,126 --> 01:45:46,356
Ready? 1-2-3!

1355
01:45:49,868 --> 01:45:50,926
This place is really nice.

1356
01:46:00,683 --> 01:46:01,741
Like it?

1357
01:46:05,022 --> 01:46:06,080
Nice.

1358
01:46:06,157 --> 01:46:09,752
You know, the best thing about
him is that he's chivalrous.

1359
01:46:10,763 --> 01:46:13,698
I mean, he knows that
I'm a strong and successful..

1360
01:46:13,767 --> 01:46:18,761
..career woman, but he never
forgets that I'm also a girl.

1361
01:46:22,046 --> 01:46:24,310
Is she a helpless girl?
Are her hands broken?

1362
01:46:24,783 --> 01:46:25,841
Yes, but..

1363
01:46:25,918 --> 01:46:27,385
Then why do you have to pull
her chair, open her bottle..

1364
01:46:27,454 --> 01:46:28,978
Dude, treat her like an equal.

1365
01:46:29,055 --> 01:46:30,113
But I do..

1366
01:46:47,348 --> 01:46:50,476
Oh, okay.

1367
01:47:06,107 --> 01:47:07,904
Thanks, Pierre.
The table was perfect.

1368
01:47:07,977 --> 01:47:10,172
And we had such a great
time as usual. See you!

1369
01:47:13,351 --> 01:47:14,409
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1370
01:47:16,790 --> 01:47:18,121
What is wrong with you?

1371
01:47:22,330 --> 01:47:23,797
Neha. Neha. Neha..

1372
01:47:23,865 --> 01:47:25,332
Don't touch me.
- But Neha, listen..

1373
01:47:25,401 --> 01:47:28,529
What's wrong with you,
Abhi? You're acting so weird.

1374
01:47:29,140 --> 01:47:31,301
I mean, if you didn't like me,
then you could've told me.

1375
01:47:31,376 --> 01:47:32,809
Why do you have to behave like this?

1376
01:47:34,147 --> 01:47:37,207
Is this some sort of a joke?
Do you think this is funny? I don't.

1377
01:47:37,285 --> 01:47:40,812
Joke? Do you think it's a
joke to get yourself waxed?

1378
01:47:41,423 --> 01:47:43,891
Wearing these ridiculous clothes,
acting like an idiot

1379
01:47:44,161 --> 01:47:50,430
I don't think it's funny.
Do you see me laughing?

1380
01:47:50,503 --> 01:47:52,300
Do you? Forget it!

1381
01:48:03,454 --> 01:48:07,857
Look, I'm sorry.
I really want this to work and..

1382
01:48:07,927 --> 01:48:11,419
..I'm ready to do anything for that.

1383
01:48:13,435 --> 01:48:20,466
I'll wear these kind of clothes,
wax myself, anything. Okay?

1384
01:48:23,415 --> 01:48:25,940
But when did I ask
you to do all of this?

1385
01:48:35,499 --> 01:48:36,625
She loves it.

1386
01:48:37,402 --> 01:48:41,395
Hey you, bag of hair. It looks
good on top, not everywhere.

1387
01:48:42,509 --> 01:48:44,568
You're just jealous,
you hairless wonder.

1388
01:48:53,491 --> 01:48:57,518
Hey! Are you okay?

1389
01:49:05,541 --> 01:49:07,668
Do you love each other?

1390
01:49:13,485 --> 01:49:14,543
I didn't think so.

1391
01:49:17,291 --> 01:49:18,349
Neha..

1392
01:49:18,426 --> 01:49:19,484
How do I know this?

1393
01:49:22,031 --> 01:49:23,089
Abhi..

1394
01:49:24,568 --> 01:49:31,701
The two of you met him,
made him do all this..

1395
01:49:36,518 --> 01:49:38,713
Since when have you
been hiding this from me?

1396
01:49:39,556 --> 01:49:42,320
Neha, we wanted to tell you, but..

1397
01:49:42,393 --> 01:49:44,054
But you didn't tell me, Kunal.

1398
01:49:48,602 --> 01:49:53,471
Neha, look. Please.
Forget whatever has happened.

1399
01:49:53,542 --> 01:49:55,339
We're really sorry.

1400
01:49:56,613 --> 01:49:58,410
Henceforth, everything
will happen as per your wish.

1401
01:49:59,083 --> 01:50:01,608
I promise. Look, we really
didn't mean to upset you. It's not..

1402
01:50:01,687 --> 01:50:07,091
How is that, Sam? How can
everything be like old times?

1403
01:50:08,095 --> 01:50:13,089
I mean, the three of
us are best friends.

1404
01:50:15,606 --> 01:50:21,772
We live in the same house.
We like the same guy..

1405
01:50:28,525 --> 01:50:32,052
I know that Abhi is attractive
and when you met him in the party..

1406
01:50:32,129 --> 01:50:36,122
..you might've fallen for him..

1407
01:50:42,143 --> 01:50:47,137
Now, you tell me how everything
can be just like old times.

1408
01:50:49,554 --> 01:50:53,081
Somebody's heart will surely break..

1409
01:50:53,158 --> 01:50:55,683
..and that too,
because of one of us.

1410
01:50:56,564 --> 01:50:59,124
Actually, it'll be because of me.

1411
01:51:00,669 --> 01:51:05,629
Because Abhi only likes girls.

1412
01:51:05,710 --> 01:51:11,842
And I'm the only girl
among the three of us.

1413
01:51:15,691 --> 01:51:20,253
Sorry, keep him.
I don't want him. Keep him.

1414
01:51:22,466 --> 01:51:23,524
Why are you shouting?

1415
01:51:23,602 --> 01:51:25,729
Shouting? I'm not shouting.
Keep him. I don't want him.

1416
01:51:25,805 --> 01:51:27,864
I'll live without him.
I don't know about him.

1417
01:51:29,676 --> 01:51:31,541
Trust me. There is no
problem from my end.

1418
01:51:31,613 --> 01:51:32,875
See, it's all good.

1419
01:51:35,417 --> 01:51:38,318
You mean.. it's okay?

1420
01:51:38,389 --> 01:51:40,482
Really, take him.

1421
01:51:41,693 --> 01:51:43,217
Guys, I love you.
I love you guys so much.

1422
01:51:43,296 --> 01:51:44,354
Yes. Okay.

1423
01:51:48,503 --> 01:51:53,702
Okay, what do we do now?

1424
01:51:54,778 --> 01:51:57,440
A hard blow in a hard way.

1425
01:52:15,942 --> 01:52:18,672
No, I won't go to a boarding school.

1426
01:52:19,213 --> 01:52:21,306
No, Veer. Good children don't cry.

1427
01:52:21,749 --> 01:52:24,217
Neha and your dad have
planned everything out.

1428
01:52:24,486 --> 01:52:26,613
They'll throw you out
after their wedding.

1429
01:52:26,790 --> 01:52:30,692
No, that won't happen.
My dad loves me a lot.

1430
01:52:30,762 --> 01:52:32,320
This won't happen.

1431
01:52:32,531 --> 01:52:35,830
He used to. He loves
Neha now. Isn't it?

1432
01:52:37,238 --> 01:52:38,296
No!

1433
01:52:38,873 --> 01:52:41,569
Kunal, you shouldn't
make children cry.

1434
01:52:42,245 --> 01:52:43,303
What proof do you have?

1435
01:52:43,447 --> 01:52:46,848
Proof? When your dad
returns home tonight..

1436
01:52:46,985 --> 01:52:49,351
..you tell him that you're not well.

1437
01:52:49,888 --> 01:52:55,451
But then Neha will call and your
dad will leave you suffering..

1438
01:52:55,897 --> 01:52:57,262
..and go out with Neha.

1439
01:52:58,001 --> 01:53:01,698
Then you'll know how
much your dad loves you.

1440
01:53:01,805 --> 01:53:02,999
No!

1441
01:53:03,475 --> 01:53:06,273
Kunal, so mean.

1442
01:53:07,013 --> 01:53:08,605
Abhi's actually very sweet.

1443
01:53:08,949 --> 01:53:12,282
See, this is your problem.
Too sweet!

1444
01:53:12,353 --> 01:53:15,447
If you were to call him now you'd
get to know all about his sweetness.

1445
01:53:15,525 --> 01:53:17,652
Yes. He'd answer your call and say.

1446
01:53:17,795 --> 01:53:20,696
Hello! Hi, Neha. Oh,
I'm so sorry. Not today..

1447
01:53:20,766 --> 01:53:21,892
I'm not feeling well.

1448
01:53:22,702 --> 01:53:24,863
Shut up, guys. Why would he lie?

1449
01:53:25,339 --> 01:53:27,364
He came to office this morning.
And he was perfectly fine.

1450
01:53:27,441 --> 01:53:31,605
See, Neha. This is your problem.
You're too loyal.

1451
01:53:31,814 --> 01:53:33,372
Is there anybody else at his home?

1452
01:53:33,450 --> 01:53:35,384
Does he live with anybody else Mom?
Sister? Father?

1453
01:53:35,453 --> 01:53:37,045
Yes, he has a son. Anything else?

1454
01:53:37,322 --> 01:53:39,415
Alright so he'll say
his son isn't well.

1455
01:53:39,825 --> 01:53:41,816
He doesn't need to lie to me.

1456
01:53:41,961 --> 01:53:43,826
Neha, all guys are the same.

1457
01:53:43,898 --> 01:53:45,490
Yes, you can bet on that.

1458
01:53:46,768 --> 01:53:48,065
Yes, you're on.

1459
01:53:52,911 --> 01:53:53,969
Hello.
- Hi.

1460
01:53:54,612 --> 01:53:55,670
Hey Neha!

1461
01:53:55,748 --> 01:54:00,412
I was missing you a lot.
Let's do something exciting today.

1462
01:54:00,588 --> 01:54:03,352
Not tonight. It's a bit difficult.

1463
01:54:03,425 --> 01:54:06,053
Why? Are you suddenly not well?

1464
01:54:06,363 --> 01:54:09,890
No, not me. Veer isn't feeling well.

1465
01:54:10,869 --> 01:54:13,633
Veer? Fine.

1466
01:54:23,453 --> 01:54:24,511
Neha!

1467
01:54:24,989 --> 01:54:31,053
Hey! No fever. Do you want to
play videogames?

1468
01:54:31,131 --> 01:54:32,393
Yes!

1469
01:54:32,767 --> 01:54:35,668
Naughty boy! You just said
you're not feeling well?

1470
01:54:38,941 --> 01:54:43,878
Okay, you can play videogames.
But Can I go out for one hour?

1471
01:54:44,149 --> 01:54:46,083
No.
- Just one hour.

1472
01:54:46,152 --> 01:54:48,143
No.
- Please.

1473
01:54:48,755 --> 01:54:51,883
Okay.
- I love you.

1474
01:54:59,437 --> 01:55:02,429
You know, I think he
is jealous of you.

1475
01:55:03,443 --> 01:55:04,501
Of me?

1476
01:55:08,183 --> 01:55:13,849
You know I always knew that,
when I meet someone..

1477
01:55:14,191 --> 01:55:16,125
..I would have to
fight a little for him.

1478
01:55:16,194 --> 01:55:19,129
But with his 5 year old son I mean..

1479
01:55:19,465 --> 01:55:21,126
..that's really
something I not thought about.

1480
01:55:21,201 --> 01:55:24,932
I also knew that
when I meet someone..

1481
01:55:25,006 --> 01:55:26,473
..I would have to fight
for her a little bit..

1482
01:55:27,543 --> 01:55:31,570
..but with her 2 gay
friends never thought of that.

1483
01:55:31,915 --> 01:55:34,213
You know you very lucky
that both of them are gay..

1484
01:55:34,854 --> 01:55:36,515
..or else the
competition would be really tough.

1485
01:55:36,755 --> 01:55:39,690
Yes, but I would've won.

1486
01:55:41,562 --> 01:55:44,030
Really and why is that?

1487
01:55:44,868 --> 01:55:48,929
Because I am honest, I would never
lie to you or break your heart.

1488
01:55:50,008 --> 01:55:53,842
I would change myself but
never try to change you.

1489
01:55:59,522 --> 01:56:06,587
But most importantly, I would
win because I am really good in..

1490
01:56:13,674 --> 01:56:19,135
Abhi, I cant believe you
just said that. Oh my God!

1491
01:56:24,857 --> 01:56:27,223
Basketball match? So sweet!

1492
01:56:27,294 --> 01:56:29,990
Kunal, this is no time to joke.
I'm really serious.

1493
01:56:30,064 --> 01:56:33,033
That's what I'm saying.
It's very serious.

1494
01:56:33,569 --> 01:56:35,230
You'll are all going out
together for the first time.

1495
01:56:35,305 --> 01:56:37,569
You, your daddy and your new mummy.

1496
01:56:37,641 --> 01:56:40,735
Mummy? Will she shout at me?!

1497
01:56:40,812 --> 01:56:41,870
You'll have to shout at him, Neha.

1498
01:56:42,081 --> 01:56:44,311
If he misbehaves,
then you'll have to shout at him.

1499
01:56:44,585 --> 01:56:46,644
I can't shout at him.
He's so sweet.

1500
01:56:46,720 --> 01:56:49,587
Uncle, she won't beat me, right?

1501
01:56:49,658 --> 01:56:51,250
I think you should
give him a slap or two

1502
01:56:51,327 --> 01:56:53,318
Are you crazy?!
How can I slap a kid?

1503
01:56:53,630 --> 01:56:55,996
Think about it, Veer.
Today is the day you will have to..

1504
01:56:56,067 --> 01:56:58,001
..decide what you want
your future to be like.

1505
01:56:58,070 --> 01:56:59,128
What do you mean?

1506
01:56:59,204 --> 01:57:01,695
It's simple. Today is a trailor
of what the rest of..

1507
01:57:01,775 --> 01:57:03,709
..your life is going to be like.

1508
01:57:03,777 --> 01:57:05,608
Kunal, I'm really nervous.
Will you and Sam

1509
01:57:05,680 --> 01:57:07,341
Please come to the game.

1510
01:57:07,617 --> 01:57:10,142
Don't worry, we're here for you.

1511
01:57:10,354 --> 01:57:11,821
Thank you, uncle.

1512
01:57:12,357 --> 01:57:14,120
We're sick.
- Disgusting!

1513
01:57:16,796 --> 01:57:17,854
Hello!

1514
01:57:17,931 --> 01:57:19,296
Hello, may I speak with
Abhimanyu Singh please?

1515
01:57:19,367 --> 01:57:21,028
He's not here.
Can I take a message please?

1516
01:57:21,135 --> 01:57:22,363
Well, actually this is
about the ring he ordered.

1517
01:57:25,208 --> 01:57:26,266
The ring?

1518
01:57:35,856 --> 01:57:37,153
Enjoyed it?

1519
01:57:44,402 --> 01:57:48,702
Hello. Yes, speaking. No, you wait.

1520
01:57:49,409 --> 01:57:54,904
I'll come out. I'll just come.
- Yes, sure.

1521
01:58:08,802 --> 01:58:10,429
I want to go to the bathroom.

1522
01:58:12,074 --> 01:58:13,132
You want to go right now, Veer?

1523
01:58:13,208 --> 01:58:14,436
Yes, I want to go right now.

1524
01:58:16,447 --> 01:58:18,381
Veer, wait for two minutes please.

1525
01:58:18,449 --> 01:58:19,848
No, I want to go right now.

1526
01:58:20,118 --> 01:58:22,279
Veer, dad will be here in a minute.
He'll take you there.

1527
01:58:22,755 --> 01:58:24,188
No, I want to go right now.

1528
01:58:25,992 --> 01:58:29,120
Veer, please wait. Please.
Veer, where are you going?

1529
01:58:29,198 --> 01:58:30,893
Veer, stop it. Veer,
otherwise I'll give you..

1530
01:58:33,203 --> 01:58:34,261
Sit there.

1531
01:58:38,110 --> 01:58:46,779
Look, I'm sorry, okay? Papa..
- You're having fun.

1532
01:58:50,961 --> 01:58:53,486
Hello! Hey, where are you guys?

1533
01:58:55,834 --> 01:58:58,462
Hi, I'll be right back.

1534
01:58:58,773 --> 01:58:59,831
Okay.

1535
01:59:07,317 --> 01:59:09,046
Oh, my God! Thank God that
you guys are here.

1536
01:59:09,120 --> 01:59:10,883
You have no idea how
stressed I am. Okay?

1537
01:59:12,792 --> 01:59:15,090
After the two of you hung up,
I got another phone call.

1538
01:59:15,462 --> 01:59:19,364
Actually, the call was for Abhi.
From a jewellery store.

1539
01:59:20,469 --> 01:59:22,801
To tell him that the
engagement ring is ready.

1540
01:59:23,072 --> 01:59:24,801
And that it's going to be
delivered here, you know.

1541
01:59:28,513 --> 01:59:29,810
What you don't get it? He's going..

1542
01:59:29,882 --> 01:59:32,009
..to propose here at half-time.

1543
01:59:40,063 --> 01:59:41,121
Nice, isn't it?

1544
01:59:44,169 --> 01:59:46,865
You know, I'm really nervous.

1545
01:59:46,940 --> 01:59:51,536
What do you think? Yes
or no? What should I say?

1546
01:59:51,847 --> 01:59:53,075
I really hope she says yes.

1547
01:59:53,348 --> 01:59:54,576
I really can't make sense of it.

1548
01:59:54,917 --> 01:59:57,317
I mean, so quickly all this.

1549
01:59:57,387 --> 02:00:01,323
Honestly I hadn't even
thought about marriage.

1550
02:00:10,205 --> 02:00:11,934
Guys, come on. Say something.

1551
02:00:13,611 --> 02:00:17,103
What do I say? You think
I should do it? Shall I say 'yes'?

1552
02:00:20,386 --> 02:00:21,444
Say, 'no'.

1553
02:00:27,897 --> 02:00:28,955
Say 'no', Neha.

1554
02:00:29,032 --> 02:00:31,899
Please, papa. Please don't leave me.

1555
02:00:32,370 --> 02:00:35,430
I don't like her. She's very mean.

1556
02:00:35,909 --> 02:00:37,240
But why should I say, 'no'?

1557
02:00:39,246 --> 02:00:40,304
Forget it.

1558
02:00:40,381 --> 02:00:42,212
No, no, don't walk away from me.

1559
02:00:43,018 --> 02:00:44,076
Why are you saying, 'no'?

1560
02:00:44,153 --> 02:00:46,519
Neha, let it be.

1561
02:00:47,257 --> 02:00:48,588
What is your problem, Sam?

1562
02:00:48,660 --> 02:00:50,389
My problem is that
I'm in love with you.

1563
02:00:56,938 --> 02:00:58,428
Both of us love you, Neha.

1564
02:01:00,676 --> 02:01:04,635
Have you noticed nothing?
Are you really that blind?

1565
02:01:05,316 --> 02:01:06,374
Have you gone..

1566
02:01:06,952 --> 02:01:08,010
Relax, Sam.

1567
02:01:11,491 --> 02:01:13,959
But you both are..

1568
02:01:14,028 --> 02:01:15,086
We're not gay.

1569
02:01:18,167 --> 02:01:22,103
We lied to you.
And we're sorry for that.

1570
02:01:23,976 --> 02:01:25,637
We never thought
that this would happen.

1571
02:01:27,480 --> 02:01:29,175
That both of us would
fall in love with you.

1572
02:01:31,052 --> 02:01:33,247
And we can't apologise
to you for that, Neha.

1573
02:02:37,678 --> 02:02:41,444
I can't. I'm sorry.

1574
02:02:43,754 --> 02:02:46,518
Neha, Veer..

1575
02:02:49,161 --> 02:02:53,825
Veer, doesn't want..
I'm sorry, Neha.

1576
02:03:19,370 --> 02:03:20,428
I'm sorry.

1577
02:04:06,803 --> 02:04:07,861
Don't Sam.

1578
02:04:09,840 --> 02:04:14,209
Please go away from here.

1579
02:04:18,286 --> 02:04:22,655
I don't need any of you.

1580
02:04:26,965 --> 02:04:29,229
I don't need any of you in my life.

1581
02:04:31,471 --> 02:04:34,440
Just get out of my house.

1582
02:04:37,513 --> 02:04:38,571
Just go!

1583
02:05:13,697 --> 02:05:22,969
The light is a little less bright.
The rain is a little less wet.

1584
02:05:23,711 --> 02:05:32,779
The breeze blows less often.
Desires are less in life.

1585
02:05:33,425 --> 02:05:39,057
Time has stopped such that..

1586
02:05:40,001 --> 02:05:46,839
..it seems as if it waits for you.

1587
02:06:06,971 --> 02:06:13,376
Why does my every
breath seem to be crying?

1588
02:06:13,614 --> 02:06:19,917
Why do I seem to have
befriended loneliness?

1589
02:06:20,391 --> 02:06:26,387
I don't know what this is.

1590
02:06:26,899 --> 02:06:33,828
Every morning seems
to be a dark night.

1591
02:06:37,148 --> 02:06:46,420
The light is a little less bright.
The rain is a little less wet.

1592
02:06:46,827 --> 02:06:52,857
Time has stopped such that..

1593
02:06:53,437 --> 02:07:00,502
..it seems as if it waits for you.

1594
02:07:20,409 --> 02:07:26,678
Case no.E9147463,
petition for same sex residency,

1595
02:07:32,759 --> 02:07:36,752
Congrats from today,
you are officially gay.

1596
02:07:47,747 --> 02:07:48,805
Thanks.

1597
02:07:50,084 --> 02:07:52,314
- For what? For making me gay.

1598
02:07:54,757 --> 02:07:59,319
It's because I became gay
I found you, I found Neha..

1599
02:08:00,799 --> 02:08:02,323
..found a friendship and a family.

1600
02:08:04,471 --> 02:08:06,905
..today, when I walk out
that door.. It will all be over.

1601
02:08:14,017 --> 02:08:17,475
Don't get me wrong.
I love you, dude.

1602
02:08:19,759 --> 02:08:20,817
Me too.

1603
02:08:31,776 --> 02:08:32,834
Yes.

1604
02:08:43,259 --> 02:08:44,317
We need a group hug, don't we?

1605
02:08:46,530 --> 02:08:47,792
Let's go get our girl.

1606
02:08:59,981 --> 02:09:02,040
Hello!
- Hello, aunty. It's Sam.

1607
02:09:03,153 --> 02:09:04,211
Naughty boy!

1608
02:09:04,288 --> 02:09:05,482
Hi, is Neha there?

1609
02:09:05,557 --> 02:09:08,492
Neha, she's gone to Dilno.

1610
02:09:08,961 --> 02:09:11,521
Dilno?!
- Dilno. Dilno hotel.

1611
02:09:12,065 --> 02:09:13,555
The Delano hotel, aunty!

1612
02:09:13,835 --> 02:09:15,564
Okay, good. Thanks a lot.
See you soon.

1613
02:09:17,339 --> 02:09:18,966
Phone's off. Let's go.
- Delano hotel.

1614
02:09:47,548 --> 02:09:50,881
Hey! How are you?
Hey! Nice to see you.

1615
02:09:50,953 --> 02:09:54,150
You liked the show? All right,
I guess I'll see you.

1616
02:09:54,224 --> 02:09:55,555
Bye. - Thank you.

1617
02:10:04,505 --> 02:10:05,563
Neha.

1618
02:10:05,641 --> 02:10:08,235
Neha, come on.
Just hear us out. Please!

1619
02:10:10,915 --> 02:10:11,973
What?

1620
02:10:12,383 --> 02:10:19,915
Okay. Look, we know that we lied
to you. We broke your heart..

1621
02:10:19,993 --> 02:10:23,588
And.. and..

1622
02:10:26,202 --> 02:10:27,567
Will you say something?
You're good at this.

1623
02:10:27,671 --> 02:10:34,338
Yes, Neha, we know that we lied
to you. We broke your heart..

1624
02:10:34,948 --> 02:10:37,576
I just said that.
- I'm trying..

1625
02:10:38,019 --> 02:10:40,214
Try harder. Have you lost it?
What are you talking..

1626
02:10:40,289 --> 02:10:41,517
You know, you guys are
never going to change

1627
02:10:41,590 --> 02:10:42,682
Why am I even..

1628
02:10:43,627 --> 02:10:44,685
Hey!

1629
02:10:54,575 --> 02:10:55,633
Your hair's grown back!

1630
02:10:58,715 --> 02:10:59,977
When's the wedding?

1631
02:11:02,988 --> 02:11:05,149
Abhi and I aren't together anymore.

1632
02:11:09,730 --> 02:11:11,197
Veer didn't want..

1633
02:11:24,017 --> 02:11:25,279
See you, guys.
- Abhi!

1634
02:11:28,456 --> 02:11:33,621
Guys, we want to say
something to both of you.

1635
02:11:42,410 --> 02:11:45,106
Neha. Abhi.. guys.. come on.. Neha.

1636
02:11:45,213 --> 02:11:46,771
Just get out of my life.
Both of you!

1637
02:11:52,791 --> 02:11:54,088
Neha.
- Neha, come on.

1638
02:11:55,061 --> 02:11:56,323
Neha, we'll talk to Veer.

1639
02:11:56,562 --> 02:12:03,195
Don't. From today you
will not even go near Veer.

1640
02:12:04,473 --> 02:12:05,735
You got it?
- Abhi, look..

1641
02:12:05,809 --> 02:12:09,711
Veer's just five years old.
He's just a child and you both..

1642
02:12:12,285 --> 02:12:13,343
You guys disgust me!

1643
02:12:13,419 --> 02:12:14,681
Look, we were wrong.

1644
02:12:14,822 --> 02:12:16,312
We know that and that's
why we're apologizing.

1645
02:12:17,692 --> 02:12:21,184
Neha, we're willing to do
anything for your forgiveness.

1646
02:12:22,699 --> 02:12:24,724
Anything. Whatever it takes.

1647
02:12:26,637 --> 02:12:27,695
Let's just go.

1648
02:12:31,845 --> 02:12:35,645
Bruno! Dude, stop those two.
Stop right here sir

1649
02:12:35,717 --> 02:12:36,775
Yes, yes. Them. Them..

1650
02:12:43,261 --> 02:12:45,593
Ladies and gentlemen,
can I have your attention please?

1651
02:12:46,265 --> 02:12:51,396
Hey! Hi, I'm Sam and this
is Kunal and that is Neha.

1652
02:12:51,472 --> 02:12:52,803
Isn't she beautiful?

1653
02:12:53,542 --> 02:12:55,806
And that's Abhi
the love of her life.

1654
02:12:56,346 --> 02:12:59,679
She's our best
friend and we lied to her.

1655
02:13:00,552 --> 02:13:01,814
We told her that
we're a gay couple.

1656
02:13:05,225 --> 02:13:08,217
We lied. We're not gay.

1657
02:13:09,765 --> 02:13:12,290
We've done a lot of things
that we aren't proud of.

1658
02:13:12,502 --> 02:13:14,367
But we're trying
to say sorry to her.

1659
02:13:14,437 --> 02:13:16,496
Can you please tell
Neha to forgive us?

1660
02:13:16,574 --> 02:13:21,841
Come on, Neha, come on Neha
- Forgive them.

1661
02:13:22,183 --> 02:13:23,241
Come on, Neha.

1662
02:13:23,851 --> 02:13:25,443
Hey! You guys should beg and plead.

1663
02:13:28,925 --> 02:13:31,519
Neha, we beg you.

1664
02:13:32,330 --> 02:13:34,525
Get down on your knees and
tell her that you love her.

1665
02:13:38,738 --> 02:13:39,796
We love you, Neha.

1666
02:13:40,808 --> 02:13:42,332
Just give her a kiss.

1667
02:13:45,615 --> 02:13:47,742
Come on, give each other a kiss.

1668
02:13:48,686 --> 02:13:49,880
Yes, you're funny.

1669
02:14:01,370 --> 02:14:02,428
What?!

1670
02:14:02,839 --> 02:14:03,897
You want to be forgiven right..

1671
02:14:05,309 --> 02:14:07,368
..then kiss each other
right here, right now

1672
02:14:08,780 --> 02:14:10,907
..in front of everybody.

1673
02:14:14,256 --> 02:14:19,387
C'mon, guys! You like
being gay, right? Kiss!

1674
02:14:23,801 --> 02:14:25,928
Come on, guys! Do it for Neha.

1675
02:14:32,347 --> 02:14:38,343
Come on, Kunal. Let's do this.
Kunal, Come on. Ready?

1676
02:14:38,622 --> 02:14:39,680
Are you mad?

1677
02:14:40,025 --> 02:14:41,287
What difference does it make?

1678
02:14:41,694 --> 02:14:44,686
It does make a difference.
I'm not gay.

1679
02:14:44,765 --> 02:14:45,823
Yes, even I'm not gay.

1680
02:14:48,770 --> 02:14:55,437
But we have to do
this for Neha. Come on.

1681
02:14:57,382 --> 02:14:59,373
Okay, Okay. Okay, Okay. Okay!

1682
02:15:23,485 --> 02:15:24,543
I can't do this.

1683
02:15:25,688 --> 02:15:27,883
Come on, no.

1684
02:15:30,762 --> 02:15:34,357
I cannot. No, no..

1685
02:15:34,434 --> 02:15:38,370
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

1686
02:15:38,639 --> 02:15:42,632
No, let it be. It's fine.
I can't do it.

1687
02:16:05,477 --> 02:16:10,938
I would have never done this.
Not even for you.

1688
02:16:15,425 --> 02:16:18,417
These guys, they truly
are your best friends.

1689
02:16:18,495 --> 02:16:25,697
These passing
