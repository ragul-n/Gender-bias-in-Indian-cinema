1
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:44,302
The one, who is coming now, is G. K.

2
00:03:44,303 --> 00:03:46,003
That means Goragade Krishnamurthy.

3
00:03:46,004 --> 00:03:52,043
He will be revolving around the money
always like how earth revolves the Sun.

4
00:03:52,044 --> 00:03:55,980
But the wonder is... That money
alone is revolving around G. K only.

5
00:03:55,981 --> 00:03:58,449
He's strike perfectly.

6
00:03:59,718 --> 00:04:03,020
Improving his 40,000 crores
to one lakh crores...

7
00:04:03,021 --> 00:04:04,656
To become the topper
in world's millionaire

8
00:04:04,657 --> 00:04:06,290
list, is G. K's life ambition.

9
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:07,892
Her name is Rajalakshmi.

10
00:04:07,893 --> 00:04:10,127
GK's Partner cum business partner.

11
00:04:10,128 --> 00:04:14,189
He's his elder son. He's his
son-in-law, who stays in his house.

12
00:04:14,933 --> 00:04:16,867
She is G. K's daughter.

13
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:19,304
She's his daughter-in-law.

14
00:04:19,305 --> 00:04:24,742
They are G. K's family members. They
will be keep on working as machines.

15
00:04:24,743 --> 00:04:28,145
A naughty boy is there
in this machinery family.

16
00:04:28,146 --> 00:04:29,181
His name is Krishna.

17
00:04:29,182 --> 00:04:31,515
Not super star Krishna. Sri Krishna.

18
00:04:31,516 --> 00:04:33,350
If they are all working machines...

19
00:04:33,351 --> 00:04:35,120
He is like the repair,
which comes often.

20
00:04:35,121 --> 00:04:37,987
He's the tension &
he is the relief to this family.

21
00:04:45,831 --> 00:04:47,349
Greets, priest.
- What? Are they going to

22
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:48,866
offer anything equal
to his weight here?

23
00:04:48,867 --> 00:04:52,770
It's not for God. - Then...?
- It's for G. K sir's son.

24
00:04:52,771 --> 00:04:54,039
Today is his birthday.

25
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:57,208
What are they going to offer?
Is that jaggery or rice else?

26
00:04:57,209 --> 00:05:00,344
Why should they offer
jaggery or rice?

27
00:05:00,345 --> 00:05:01,947
They are going to keep
currency bundles.

28
00:05:01,948 --> 00:05:08,948
Currency notes! Money!

29
00:05:12,224 --> 00:05:15,226
Who is that cash boy, the one
is equal to currency notes?

30
00:05:15,227 --> 00:05:22,227
Govinda! He's the son
of goddess of wealth.

31
00:05:25,871 --> 00:05:28,406
We can't believe that he has
got so many crores. Right?

32
00:05:28,407 --> 00:05:29,999
Believe that at least only once.

33
00:05:33,979 --> 00:05:36,279
Send the full currency bundles
to Thirupathy temple.

34
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,373
- Okay, sir.
- Come on.

35
00:05:38,483 --> 00:05:40,886
Your son's weight is keep on
increasing every year.

36
00:05:40,887 --> 00:05:43,955
Let's give bonus to all of our staffs
in this happy moment, sir.

37
00:05:43,956 --> 00:05:45,056
Why bonus?

38
00:05:45,057 --> 00:05:47,024
Don't you know about bonus?

39
00:05:47,025 --> 00:05:49,025
I don't like giving money to others.
Don't you know that?

40
00:05:49,026 --> 00:05:50,829
I know that, sir.
You only don't know to offer.

41
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:54,565
Sir! Give alms.
Why are you coming closer?

42
00:05:54,566 --> 00:05:57,368
Stay away. - They are also
human being. Right, sir?

43
00:05:57,369 --> 00:05:58,401
They are nasty people.

44
00:05:58,402 --> 00:06:00,205
Leave them, dad.
Let's give Rs. 10 per head.

45
00:06:00,206 --> 00:06:02,273
Rs. 10 per head...? What do you say?

46
00:06:02,274 --> 00:06:05,409
Manoj! - Dad!
- Give Rs. 10 only to everybody.

47
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:06,411
They will share it themselves.

48
00:06:06,412 --> 00:06:09,080
Okay, dad. - Brother!
If it Rs. 10, it will be bad.

49
00:06:09,081 --> 00:06:10,515
Give Rs. 100 per head.
- Why do you say so?

50
00:06:10,516 --> 00:06:11,948
My dad will scold me. It's wrong.

51
00:06:11,949 --> 00:06:14,119
Here is Rs. 10, brother.
All of you share it carefully.

52
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,554
Wait, boy. - Why?
- Is this your birthday?

53
00:06:16,555 --> 00:06:20,324
It's mine. Take this Rs. 10
& buy chocolates.

54
00:06:20,325 --> 00:06:21,815
Hey! Give me that Rs. 100.

55
00:06:23,161 --> 00:06:25,063
Dear! We give this Rs.
100 as a gift to

56
00:06:25,064 --> 00:06:26,964
you on behalf of our
beggars association.

57
00:06:26,965 --> 00:06:27,965
Take it.

58
00:06:27,966 --> 00:06:30,234
Take Briyani & take a coke.

59
00:06:30,235 --> 00:06:32,637
All of you tell him
your birthday wishes.

60
00:06:32,638 --> 00:06:35,039
- Happy birthday to you.

61
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,167
You idiot! Why you too...?
Here. Buy chocolates.

62
00:06:50,522 --> 00:06:52,223
Why did you stop here
in this rainy time?

63
00:06:52,224 --> 00:06:53,924
Let's get drenched for sometime.
Get down.

64
00:06:53,925 --> 00:06:55,723
There is shower in your house. Right?

65
00:06:55,724 --> 00:06:57,520
- We won't wear dress there.
Right? Enjoy!

66
00:07:52,317 --> 00:07:53,375
Hey Kishore! Come, man.

67
00:08:24,349 --> 00:08:28,185
Eshwar! - Hey! Ghost has come.
Run off, boys.

68
00:08:28,186 --> 00:08:30,677
Ghost...?

69
00:08:38,597 --> 00:08:40,997
Stop there!

70
00:08:43,201 --> 00:08:44,259
Stop there!

71
00:08:53,211 --> 00:08:55,680
If I ask you to become a collector
or officers by studying well...

72
00:08:55,681 --> 00:08:57,443
Are you playing crazy games here?

73
00:08:59,251 --> 00:09:03,254
Come. Let's study. - Sathya!
Why do you compel our children?

74
00:09:03,255 --> 00:09:04,589
They are not interested
in studies. Right?

75
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:07,224
You are living in huts only
for being an illiterate.

76
00:09:07,225 --> 00:09:09,226
You leave me your children.

77
00:09:09,227 --> 00:09:11,795
Let me educate them & make
them a great person.

78
00:09:11,796 --> 00:09:15,027
Our children will not become collectors
by hearing your words. Right?

79
00:09:15,433 --> 00:09:18,469
Understand us now at least, Sathya.

80
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:22,706
If we send them for work instead of
sending them to school paying fees...

81
00:09:22,707 --> 00:09:24,775
We can get money for
our expenditures at least.

82
00:09:24,776 --> 00:09:26,107
Allow us to live like this.

83
00:09:28,647 --> 00:09:32,349
Hey children! Go & play. Go.

84
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:34,375
Hey! All of you should come
in the evening.

85
00:09:54,406 --> 00:10:01,406
Please, somebody educate
this area children.

86
00:10:02,847 --> 00:10:05,516
Hey Kishore!
I like that girl very much.

87
00:10:05,517 --> 00:10:07,551
Can she like me little bit at least?

88
00:10:07,552 --> 00:10:10,421
What lacks for you?
If she comes to know

89
00:10:10,422 --> 00:10:13,290
your richness, she
will cry to marry you.

90
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:14,192
Come. Let me introduce you to her.

91
00:10:14,193 --> 00:10:16,594
Let me play first. Give me.

92
00:10:16,595 --> 00:10:20,725
I only will play.
- Hey idiot! Stop it!

93
00:10:23,168 --> 00:10:25,295
Are you driving keeping
your eyes into your pocket?

94
00:10:25,704 --> 00:10:27,871
Why do you scold me?
Do you know who am I?

95
00:10:27,872 --> 00:10:31,642
I know, man. You're a millionaire,
who has lot of haughtiness.

96
00:10:31,643 --> 00:10:34,305
We have to murder all the millionaires.

97
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:37,781
- About turn!
- Hey!

98
00:10:37,782 --> 00:10:40,618
Are you scolding me
for those laborers?

99
00:10:40,619 --> 00:10:42,119
Who are labors?

100
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:46,457
They've changed as laborers
because of millionaires domination only.

101
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:49,193
Oh god! - Why are you
talking too much?

102
00:10:49,194 --> 00:10:51,462
Hey! If you talk to me,
I'll murder you.

103
00:10:51,463 --> 00:10:54,632
You've earned crores of money
by using poor people's blood.

104
00:10:54,633 --> 00:10:58,501
Let me anoint these poor children
by rich people's blood.

105
00:10:59,371 --> 00:11:02,273
She's not a naxalite, is she?

106
00:11:02,274 --> 00:11:04,574
Leave him, sister. Our dress is
an old dress only, isn't it?

107
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:05,770
Hey! Shut your mouth!

108
00:11:06,311 --> 00:11:09,680
Hey! I don't even like millionaires.

109
00:11:09,681 --> 00:11:12,349
Give money for their
new dresses with respect.

110
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:14,785
Or I will tear your tires.

111
00:11:14,786 --> 00:11:16,387
- Okay.
- Give me money.

112
00:11:16,388 --> 00:11:18,151
Here. Take it.

113
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:22,660
Take it, boys. Buy new dresses.
You also take it. - Okay, sister.

114
00:11:22,661 --> 00:11:27,264
This girl doesn't like
rich people it seems.

115
00:11:27,265 --> 00:11:30,723
Admiring this girl,
is tough it seems. Come on.

116
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:36,440
Ammu! - Hey! Leave me.
- What's my Tiff in today?

117
00:11:36,441 --> 00:11:38,242
If you touch me, I'll kill you.

118
00:11:38,243 --> 00:11:39,403
Oh god! Why are you so hot?

119
00:11:40,779 --> 00:11:44,682
Driver! Arvind...

120
00:11:44,683 --> 00:11:46,850
I'm coming, sir. I'm bringing the file.

121
00:11:46,851 --> 00:11:48,286
Let me come back now itself, darling.

122
00:11:48,287 --> 00:11:49,820
Why do you come, dog?

123
00:11:49,821 --> 00:11:50,955
He is disturbing me always.

124
00:11:50,956 --> 00:11:53,557
Hey! Won't you come
if I don't call you by your name?

125
00:11:53,558 --> 00:11:56,260
Is the name Arvind, necessity
for your driver face?

126
00:11:56,261 --> 00:11:57,660
Don't your parents have sense?

127
00:11:57,661 --> 00:11:58,897
To name you as Arvind...!

128
00:11:58,898 --> 00:12:01,398
My parents don't know that I'm going
to become a driver. Right, sir?

129
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:03,434
That's why they named me as Arvind.

130
00:12:03,435 --> 00:12:05,469
Why are you watching
into the suitcase?

131
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:07,529
Look downwards. Give me the file.

132
00:12:08,473 --> 00:12:10,703
Look here. Look there.

133
00:12:13,778 --> 00:12:17,781
- Your son has become charming.
- Why?

134
00:12:17,782 --> 00:12:19,816
I'm telling that marriage beauty
has come on his face.

135
00:12:19,817 --> 00:12:21,820
Why do you say so? Can't your
laborers speak good words?

136
00:12:21,821 --> 00:12:24,455
Why do you look me again?
Look downwards!

137
00:12:24,456 --> 00:12:29,360
Look that side! My son won't
fall in love with any girl.

138
00:12:29,361 --> 00:12:31,693
His wife should have
- 25,000 crores at least.

139
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:34,765
She'd not know about
the poverty instead of richness.

140
00:12:34,766 --> 00:12:36,733
You won't get married
in this birth it seems.

141
00:12:36,734 --> 00:12:38,635
I will marry her in this birth itself.
Wait and see.

142
00:12:51,549 --> 00:12:54,752
Torn slippers! Rs. 16!
Torn pants! Rs. 40.

143
00:12:54,753 --> 00:12:56,820
Shirt with holes. Rs. 32!
- I've worn it.

144
00:12:56,821 --> 00:12:58,589
Hey! Are we looking like
the real poor people?

145
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:00,357
- Real poor people
also won't be so bad.

146
00:13:00,358 --> 00:13:02,327
We are just acting here. Right?
That's why I've added more dosage.

147
00:13:02,328 --> 00:13:08,994
That girl is looking so soft sometimes &
so violent sometimes. I'm fearing, man.

148
00:13:10,568 --> 00:13:12,503
Look there. Your girl is coming.

149
00:13:12,504 --> 00:13:14,589
Is everything ready there?
I've given Rs.

150
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:16,673
100 per head & asked them to act well.

151
00:13:16,674 --> 00:13:18,335
Let's go there. Come on.

152
00:13:19,277 --> 00:13:26,277
Goddess Saraswathy!
Live long! Give me a boon, goddess.

153
00:13:26,451 --> 00:13:31,445
Give us education. - Not that,
uncle. Give us education.

154
00:13:36,528 --> 00:13:41,598
Children! Tell me.
A means... Amalapuram!

155
00:13:41,599 --> 00:13:43,902
What did you teach them?
- I taught them English letters, man.

156
00:13:43,903 --> 00:13:46,537
Children! A for apple.

157
00:13:46,538 --> 00:13:47,971
Keep your money inside.

158
00:13:53,845 --> 00:13:55,979
What, man?
- I've taught them like that only.

159
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:57,881
Why did you teach them 2 letters?

160
00:13:57,882 --> 00:14:00,282
Okay. Has she come?

161
00:14:01,753 --> 00:14:03,621
She's come. You proceed!

162
00:14:03,622 --> 00:14:05,489
- Is she seeing me?
- She's seeing me too.

163
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:12,490
Children! You'd study well & got good
name to your parents and our country.

164
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:13,765
What do you say, ma'am?

165
00:14:13,766 --> 00:14:16,632
If you say us so clearly,
what else we can say?

166
00:14:16,901 --> 00:14:19,102
You teach such a lesson
to our children daily.

167
00:14:19,103 --> 00:14:21,439
Oh god! They are not normal people.
If we

168
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,774
leave them, they will
finish us totally.

169
00:14:23,775 --> 00:14:26,109
Children! You study these
- 2 letters well today.

170
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:28,340
Let me come again tomorrow
& teach you 2 more letters.

171
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:35,619
Thanks a lot for teaching
to those children.

172
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:36,754
Is there your child also
in that group?

173
00:14:36,755 --> 00:14:38,789
No. I'm not yet married.

174
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:40,091
My friend is also unmarried.

175
00:14:40,092 --> 00:14:42,626
My name is Sathya. Your name...?

176
00:14:42,627 --> 00:14:43,862
My name is Sri Krishna.

177
00:14:43,863 --> 00:14:48,031
I'm a poor boy.
- Then... Your name...?

178
00:14:48,032 --> 00:14:50,067
- Kishore!
- Poor Kishore!

179
00:14:50,068 --> 00:14:51,568
Why poor Kishore?

180
00:14:51,569 --> 00:14:53,704
Somebody told his parents
that if they name

181
00:14:53,705 --> 00:14:55,839
him like that, their
poverty would go off.

182
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:58,775
Did their poverty go off?
- His parents passed away.

183
00:14:58,776 --> 00:15:00,544
He's become too poor.

184
00:15:00,545 --> 00:15:05,115
You people have become poor because of
those millionaires & not by your name.

185
00:15:05,116 --> 00:15:10,954
Yes. I don't like the word millionaire
alone in all the languages.

186
00:15:10,955 --> 00:15:13,023
Millionaire means...
- I got angry on them.

187
00:15:13,024 --> 00:15:14,492
Poor people means...?
- I take pity on them.

188
00:15:14,493 --> 00:15:17,394
I know these poor people's
problems from my childhood.

189
00:15:17,395 --> 00:15:20,198
Poor people will wake up
in the early morning,

190
00:15:20,199 --> 00:15:23,000
wear torn shirt & keep a torn towel...

191
00:15:23,001 --> 00:15:26,403
They will do lot of works
in front of millionaires.

192
00:15:26,404 --> 00:15:27,970
If they come back to their
hut in the evening...

193
00:15:27,971 --> 00:15:30,074
There won't be Gaiser for them
to take hot water.

194
00:15:30,075 --> 00:15:33,944
They won't have bed to sleep
& costly rice to eat.

195
00:15:33,945 --> 00:15:36,680
They won't have any non vegetarian
item to eat along with rice.

196
00:15:36,681 --> 00:15:38,049
They won't have gravy also finally.

197
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:41,051
One side is richness.
Another side is burning heart.

198
00:15:41,052 --> 00:15:43,820
One side is luxurious life.
Another side is stinking life style.

199
00:15:43,821 --> 00:15:48,992
Who can solve these
poor people's problems?

200
00:15:48,993 --> 00:15:50,494
Who can save them?

201
00:15:50,495 --> 00:15:52,395
Tell me, ma'am.

202
00:15:53,831 --> 00:15:56,199
People! Control me, man.

203
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,601
What are you doing?

204
00:15:57,602 --> 00:15:59,736
What will we poor people do, ma'am?

205
00:15:59,737 --> 00:16:02,706
Petrol bunk...!
- Your phone number?

206
00:16:06,844 --> 00:16:09,780
Let me call you often.
- Call me at any time, ma'am.

207
00:16:09,781 --> 00:16:12,116
My number too... - How do you
have a cell phone, dear?

208
00:16:12,117 --> 00:16:13,447
Let us leave, ma'am.

209
00:16:23,595 --> 00:16:26,830
Krishna! It's me Sathya.

210
00:16:26,831 --> 00:16:29,166
Is that you...? Just a minute.

211
00:16:29,167 --> 00:16:34,537
Kishore! Pour 2 liters of petrol
freely to that poor man.

212
00:16:35,873 --> 00:16:37,207
Let me pour 2 liters.

213
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:38,575
You're too great, sir.

214
00:16:38,576 --> 00:16:41,078
I'm helping to some
poor people in my salary.

215
00:16:41,079 --> 00:16:42,779
Why did you call me?

216
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:44,148
Where is your petrol bunk?

217
00:16:44,149 --> 00:16:47,651
Jubilee Hills! I'll come there
in another half an hour.

218
00:16:47,652 --> 00:16:49,653
- In half an hour...?
- Why? No. .?

219
00:16:49,654 --> 00:16:51,952
No. You come!

220
00:16:53,825 --> 00:16:55,892
What do you want? Diesel or petrol...?

221
00:16:55,893 --> 00:16:58,128
We need a job of filling those 2.

222
00:16:58,129 --> 00:16:59,530
I won't sell the jobs here.

223
00:16:59,531 --> 00:17:01,732
If I work here for sometime,
that's enough.

224
00:17:01,733 --> 00:17:03,666
Are these illicit notes? Real notes.

225
00:17:03,667 --> 00:17:05,136
Axis bank chit is there in it, right?
Check it out.

226
00:17:05,137 --> 00:17:07,604
Hey! Give them uniforms.

227
00:17:07,605 --> 00:17:08,902
- Change it, man.
- Okay.

228
00:17:13,011 --> 00:17:16,674
How is this Raja Sekar's get up?
Tell me.

229
00:17:18,182 --> 00:17:22,482
Your mother...! Mother!
Hey! Come there.

230
00:17:24,122 --> 00:17:25,903
It's a get up. - If she
finds you, that's all.

231
00:17:25,904 --> 00:17:27,683
- If she doesn't find
me, we are saved.

232
00:17:32,897 --> 00:17:35,195
Dear! Is not he looking like our son?

233
00:17:37,802 --> 00:17:39,169
He won't be my son.

234
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:42,639
If you say that my son buys a petrol
tank in Dubai, I'll believe that.

235
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,576
If you say that he works in an Andhra
petrol bunk, I won't believe that.

236
00:17:46,577 --> 00:17:47,703
- Hey!
- Come here.

237
00:17:48,646 --> 00:17:54,685
What's your name?
- Did you see? He's a dumb boy.

238
00:17:54,686 --> 00:17:55,887
Hey! Full tank!

239
00:17:55,888 --> 00:17:58,879
Hey! Back! It's a car.

240
00:18:03,161 --> 00:18:04,595
Why are you looking like that?

241
00:18:04,596 --> 00:18:07,164
It is common in our job, ma'am.
Otherwise we won't get food.

242
00:18:07,165 --> 00:18:08,299
You tell me the matter first.

243
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:10,183
Is your duty over?

244
00:18:10,184 --> 00:18:12,065
- My duty is over now. His
duty has got started just now.

245
00:18:13,171 --> 00:18:14,571
Sit on the scooter.

246
00:18:14,572 --> 00:18:16,173
Hey! Take care of the bunk.

247
00:18:16,174 --> 00:18:17,607
Come on.

248
00:18:20,111 --> 00:18:22,102
Petrol! Festival discount!

249
00:18:25,349 --> 00:18:28,752
Did you see?
Nobody is there to help them.

250
00:18:28,753 --> 00:18:30,488
Don't worry. You request
this with a good heart.

251
00:18:30,489 --> 00:18:32,222
So your wish will come true.

252
00:18:32,223 --> 00:18:34,691
Can it take place?
- Lt will take place definitely.

253
00:18:35,693 --> 00:18:41,798
Don't cry, guys.
Go to school & study. - Wait!

254
00:18:41,799 --> 00:18:43,067
Why are you crying?

255
00:18:43,068 --> 00:18:46,870
You wrote on the wall as somebody
should educate these poor children.

256
00:18:46,871 --> 00:18:48,272
It's changed our children's fate.

257
00:18:48,273 --> 00:18:52,075
A rich person has come forward
to educate our children.

258
00:18:52,076 --> 00:18:54,244
Who is he?
- He didn't tell us his name.

259
00:18:54,245 --> 00:18:58,281
Study well. Studies only can
change poor people's fate.

260
00:18:58,282 --> 00:19:00,842
Go. It's getting late
for the school. Right? Go.

261
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,349
- Bye, dad.
- Bye! Tata!

262
00:19:10,394 --> 00:19:14,364
Somebody has admitted those
poor children in the school as you said.

263
00:19:14,365 --> 00:19:18,201
I've prayed the god
as that person should live well.

264
00:19:18,202 --> 00:19:22,339
- Flower, ma'am!
- Did you see her?

265
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:24,900
She's selling flowers
in this studying age.

266
00:19:25,877 --> 00:19:28,979
- What's your name, dear?
- Chamanthi!

267
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:31,982
Are you selling flowers
having a flower name?

268
00:19:31,983 --> 00:19:33,951
Shall I sell these flowers?
- Okay, brother.

269
00:19:38,055 --> 00:19:44,294
Jasmine! Aunty! Take jasmine flowers.

270
00:19:44,295 --> 00:19:47,397
No mood. - Wear this flower.
You'll get mood. - Dear!

271
00:19:47,398 --> 00:19:50,300
He is telling that I will get mood
if I wear his flower.

272
00:19:50,301 --> 00:19:52,168
He may get mood. But we won't get it.

273
00:19:52,169 --> 00:19:53,805
You also buy a flower bunch, sir.
You'll get mood.

274
00:19:53,806 --> 00:19:55,390
Although I won't get mood.

275
00:19:55,391 --> 00:19:56,973
- You take 2 boxes of
electuary daily, then.

276
00:19:56,974 --> 00:20:03,974
Jasmine! Flower! Flower!

277
00:20:04,348 --> 00:20:06,917
Krishna! Why do you sell flowers?

278
00:20:06,918 --> 00:20:08,853
My name is not Krishna. Shoban Babu.

279
00:20:08,854 --> 00:20:11,421
- Flower!
- Hey! Stop! Hey you!

280
00:20:11,422 --> 00:20:12,684
Show me your face.

281
00:20:13,124 --> 00:20:19,723
Look my basket. Don't think
to see my face in the back side.

282
00:20:20,631 --> 00:20:25,001
You can't bear it.

283
00:20:25,002 --> 00:20:26,570
Why? Is your face, so bad?

284
00:20:26,571 --> 00:20:29,706
Can a flower vendor's face
be beautiful instead of bad?

285
00:20:29,707 --> 00:20:31,309
He resembles my brother exactly. Right?

286
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:34,477
- 7 people will be alike
in the world it seems.

287
00:20:34,478 --> 00:20:36,279
He is looking like a comedian.

288
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,182
- Come. Let's go.
- Do you say like that?

289
00:20:38,183 --> 00:20:41,451
Flower vendor! You resemble
my brother exactly.

290
00:20:41,452 --> 00:20:42,720
Have this Rs. 1000.

291
00:20:42,721 --> 00:20:45,455
Thanks, sir. Let me think you
as my brother & sister-in-law.

292
00:20:45,456 --> 00:20:49,292
Here. Take this flower. Flower...

293
00:20:49,293 --> 00:20:51,412
You'd go to school & study well. Okay?

294
00:20:51,413 --> 00:20:53,530
- Dear! I sold your jasmine
alone for Rs. 1000.

295
00:20:53,531 --> 00:20:55,328
Here. - Thank you, brother.
Shall we go.

296
00:20:56,173 --> 00:20:59,574
I've got a satisfaction
of helping a poor child.

297
00:21:00,611 --> 00:21:02,101
Your heart is too good.

298
00:21:10,587 --> 00:21:13,715
You're too beautiful.
- Am I beautiful?

299
00:21:15,225 --> 00:21:17,716
If you smile, you are too cute.

300
00:21:18,862 --> 00:21:20,022
You're too cute even
if you don't smile.

301
00:21:21,031 --> 00:21:23,766
If you come calmly like this,
you are too cute.

302
00:21:23,767 --> 00:21:26,636
What happened to you?
You've started praising me.

303
00:21:26,637 --> 00:21:28,103
I've not yet started
to praise you, ma'am.

304
00:21:28,104 --> 00:21:29,807
Leave it. Do you ask me
to start that now?

305
00:21:29,808 --> 00:21:32,575
King! Enough. Please move.

306
00:21:32,576 --> 00:21:33,634
Okay.

307
00:21:36,246 --> 00:21:42,913
Did you call me? - No. - I thought
that you've called me. Okay. Bye!

308
00:21:47,891 --> 00:21:54,891
My heart has got missed slowly.

309
00:21:57,868 --> 00:22:02,066
It is because of you, baby.

310
00:22:34,304 --> 00:22:39,809
You've admired my heart slowly.

311
00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:46,810
My heart has got missed
because of you, baby.

312
00:22:47,618 --> 00:22:53,723
Oh my lover! Is that my naughtiness?

313
00:22:53,724 --> 00:22:59,028
You only have hidden my heart.

314
00:22:59,029 --> 00:23:05,168
You've shown me the whole
world in my dream, baby.

315
00:23:05,169 --> 00:23:10,406
You've admired my heart slowly.

316
00:23:10,407 --> 00:23:17,407
My heart has got missed
because of you, baby.

317
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:51,278
Oh my sweet heart!
You're like a new river.

318
00:23:52,349 --> 00:23:57,286
Sophia! My mind has
turned towards you.

319
00:23:58,388 --> 00:24:03,726
Oh my dear! My heart is
missing after meeting you.

320
00:24:03,727 --> 00:24:09,063
I've searched it everywhere. I found
that I gave my heart to you finally.

321
00:24:12,369 --> 00:24:15,071
You're a net of colourful flowers.

322
00:24:15,072 --> 00:24:22,072
I'm getting melted in front of you
by my great love on you.

323
00:24:23,447 --> 00:24:28,851
You've admired my heart slowly.

324
00:24:28,852 --> 00:24:35,852
My heart has got missed
because of you, baby.

325
00:24:59,816 --> 00:25:04,344
Oh my lover!
You're a fragrance flower bunch.

326
00:25:04,955 --> 00:25:10,052
Supriya! I want to bite you
seeing your beauty.

327
00:25:11,094 --> 00:25:16,199
You join me slowly.
You do whatever you want.

328
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:19,001
You don't cross the limit
by your naughty plays.

329
00:25:19,002 --> 00:25:21,871
Why do you kiss me continuously?
Stop it.

330
00:25:21,872 --> 00:25:27,810
Hey! I've started loving your
prattling language, dear.

331
00:25:27,811 --> 00:25:34,811
Shall I satisfy your needs after
hearing your demands?

332
00:25:36,019 --> 00:25:40,956
You've admired my heart slowly.

333
00:25:41,525 --> 00:25:48,525
My heart has got missed
because of you, baby.

334
00:25:49,132 --> 00:25:52,966
My heart has got missed
because of you, baby.

335
00:26:11,955 --> 00:26:15,948
Sir! A girl is torturing me
from the past 3 months.

336
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:18,961
You...? In this age...?

337
00:26:18,962 --> 00:26:20,295
Did you understand in that sense?

338
00:26:20,296 --> 00:26:21,231
Tell me the matter first.

339
00:26:21,232 --> 00:26:24,166
That girl is having some
concepts to tell you it seems.

340
00:26:24,167 --> 00:26:25,395
Who is that girl?

341
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:27,362
See. It's that girl only.

342
00:26:29,873 --> 00:26:31,008
What are those concepts?

343
00:26:31,009 --> 00:26:33,175
Removing the poverty.

344
00:26:33,176 --> 00:26:36,946
It means... - You have to buy
some acres of land in the outer city.

345
00:26:36,947 --> 00:26:40,850
You have to grow & cultivate
many vegetables in that land.

346
00:26:40,851 --> 00:26:42,218
After cultivating...

347
00:26:42,219 --> 00:26:46,815
You have to distribute those vegetables
freely for Andhra poor people.

348
00:26:47,457 --> 00:26:50,459
Do you want me to
tell the next concept? - Tell me.

349
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:51,427
You've involved in this very well.

350
00:26:52,596 --> 00:26:55,429
We have to deposit

351
00:27:01,071 --> 00:27:02,936
Am I a Puttaparthi Sai Baba?

352
00:27:04,174 --> 00:27:05,474
Get out!

353
00:27:05,475 --> 00:27:08,177
I've got his scolding in the morning
itself because of this girl.

354
00:27:08,178 --> 00:27:10,579
- Can I get in, sir?
- You can go out.

355
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:11,979
Why do you say so, sir?

356
00:27:13,383 --> 00:27:15,078
You millionaires won't
get changed, man.

357
00:27:15,485 --> 00:27:17,953
We have to burn you
people altogether.

358
00:27:17,954 --> 00:27:20,320
Your haughtiness should
get controlled. Move!

359
00:27:21,258 --> 00:27:23,559
What is the sin of millionaires?

360
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:26,529
Humanity has got
reduced in this society.

361
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:27,431
What happened?

362
00:27:27,432 --> 00:27:31,400
I asked him to spend some crores
for poor people. He said impossible.

363
00:27:31,401 --> 00:27:33,494
How many crores, ma'am?
- Simply thousand crores.

364
00:27:35,405 --> 00:27:37,374
Don't you have any
other concept except

365
00:27:37,375 --> 00:27:39,342
destroying millionaires money?
- Shut up!

366
00:27:39,343 --> 00:27:43,609
Sathya! I think I've got all the disease
at the same time while seeing you.

367
00:27:44,681 --> 00:27:49,051
Poor Kishore!
Let's take people in 2 lorries.

368
00:27:49,052 --> 00:27:50,985
Let's murder those millionaires, man.

369
00:27:50,986 --> 00:27:52,147
Lorry strike. Don't be hurry.

370
00:27:53,123 --> 00:27:54,990
Do you have his phone number?

371
00:27:54,991 --> 00:27:56,193
I have got his land number.

372
00:27:56,194 --> 00:27:58,184
Hey! Pick up the phone.

373
00:27:59,496 --> 00:28:02,624
- You idiot!
- It's for you, sir.

374
00:28:04,101 --> 00:28:05,936
- Who is this?
- Why who is this, man?

375
00:28:05,937 --> 00:28:09,338
Your uncle is a pimp.
- Uncle is a pimp...?

376
00:28:09,339 --> 00:28:11,308
Who is that?
- Why do you bother about me?

377
00:28:11,309 --> 00:28:14,977
You useless fellow, who lives
in a grand office! - Who are you?

378
00:28:14,978 --> 00:28:17,276
I'm a poor man.
- Hey! Do you know who am I?

379
00:28:19,216 --> 00:28:20,684
What's there if you are G. K?

380
00:28:20,685 --> 00:28:25,087
You're a sweet in a sugar syrup.
It's G. K it seems.

381
00:28:25,088 --> 00:28:26,453
G. K is your father, man.

382
00:28:28,492 --> 00:28:30,493
You've scold that idiot very well.

383
00:28:30,494 --> 00:28:33,429
He will get phone allergy after this.

384
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:35,564
He will get afraid of poor people.

385
00:28:35,565 --> 00:28:38,067
Okay. Let's stop this topic now itself.

386
00:28:38,068 --> 00:28:40,001
Let's meet in the same
meeting by tomorrow.

387
00:28:40,002 --> 00:28:42,105
Until then poor people's problem...?
- That girl will take care of that.

388
00:28:42,106 --> 00:28:44,240
What does sweet in sugar syrup mean?

389
00:28:44,241 --> 00:28:46,793
That's like some sweet, sir.
If we call the sweet shop...

390
00:28:46,794 --> 00:28:49,345
- Not sweet. That's a booth.

391
00:28:49,346 --> 00:28:52,148
Booth...? I don't have a great
knowledge about booth, sir.

392
00:28:52,149 --> 00:28:53,617
Get out if you don't
have that knowledge.

393
00:28:53,618 --> 00:28:57,212
Get out, you sweet in sugar syrup.

394
00:29:06,596 --> 00:29:12,601
Sheela is youthful. Sheela is
the sweet in sugar syrup.

395
00:29:12,602 --> 00:29:14,661
Sheela is the sweet in sugar syrup.

396
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:38,794
Come on. He's finished. Come.

397
00:29:38,795 --> 00:29:41,497
Stop there. Nobody should
move from here.

398
00:29:41,498 --> 00:29:44,366
Let me do his work instead of him.

399
00:29:44,367 --> 00:29:48,037
Don't be hurry. That's not a road
to walk. That's a rope. - I know that.

400
00:29:48,038 --> 00:29:49,772
But to help a poor man...

401
00:29:49,773 --> 00:29:52,071
Not only on rope.
I can walk on the water also.

402
00:30:11,328 --> 00:30:14,129
Dear! Look my brother.
He is doing rope-walking.

403
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:17,833
Your brother may be like a thief.
But if you say so, I won't believe that.

404
00:30:17,834 --> 00:30:20,336
No. He's my brother only.
See him clearly.

405
00:30:20,337 --> 00:30:23,105
If you have that much
of doubt, you call him.

406
00:30:23,106 --> 00:30:24,630
Oh my god! My sister!

407
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:29,401
Oh my god! My call center.

408
00:30:34,784 --> 00:30:37,651
Where is Krishna?
- He's there on the sky at present.

409
00:30:39,856 --> 00:30:44,093
It means...
Is he doing the rope-walking?

410
00:30:44,094 --> 00:30:46,228
Rope walking...?
Where are you now?

411
00:30:46,229 --> 00:30:47,787
I'm here only on the road.

412
00:30:49,299 --> 00:30:51,600
Oh god! We're finished.

413
00:30:51,601 --> 00:30:55,304
Why rope walking? We're watching the
cricket in Calcutta Eden garden stadium.

414
00:30:55,305 --> 00:30:59,332
Our man is catching sixes
& fours on the air.

415
00:31:02,579 --> 00:31:04,680
Dear! I've worried unnecessarily.

416
00:31:04,681 --> 00:31:07,741
He is not my brother it seems.
- Did you hear my words?

417
00:31:29,506 --> 00:31:36,506
He's fallen on her well. You'd not
see this film. Hey! Get up! It's a road.

418
00:32:18,421 --> 00:32:21,957
Tell me. - I don't know
why I didn't get sleep.

419
00:32:21,958 --> 00:32:23,692
Oh pity! How now...?

420
00:32:23,693 --> 00:32:26,629
If I tell you a matter,
I can sleep happily.

421
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:29,231
What's that? Not now.

422
00:32:29,232 --> 00:32:33,502
You open your door by tomorrow
morning at 6 o'clock sharply.

423
00:32:33,503 --> 00:32:34,868
Let me tell you my thought.

424
00:34:00,056 --> 00:34:03,826
I love you baby. You are my life.

425
00:34:03,827 --> 00:34:07,596
Let me play with you
using your beauty.

426
00:34:07,597 --> 00:34:11,567
I love you, Barbie. You're my lover.

427
00:34:11,568 --> 00:34:15,368
I'll give my beauty in your hands.

428
00:34:22,946 --> 00:34:27,716
I've seen centimeter hip in you
& millimeter shining in you.

429
00:34:27,717 --> 00:34:30,743
I've walked to many
kilometers for you.

430
00:34:34,891 --> 00:34:38,657
You're the brother of mister of lndia.

431
00:35:08,825 --> 00:35:12,127
Love is there in between you
& me, dear.

432
00:35:12,128 --> 00:35:16,498
You've approved my love
& my line has become clear now.

433
00:35:16,499 --> 00:35:20,435
Wherever I go. You came there
& admired my heart.

434
00:35:20,436 --> 00:35:23,939
You've given me a torture &
you've given a tender to my heart.

435
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:30,940
I'm like a love soldier. You come
& share my chillness, dear.

436
00:35:31,948 --> 00:35:34,974
You've turned me crazy on you.

437
00:35:35,919 --> 00:35:38,547
You've hijacked my heart.

438
00:35:39,422 --> 00:35:44,587
I'm praying in the junction
to get you only.

439
00:35:46,496 --> 00:35:49,932
I love you, Barbie. You're my lover.

440
00:35:49,933 --> 00:35:53,802
I'll give my beauty in your hands.

441
00:35:53,803 --> 00:35:57,172
I love you baby. You are my life.

442
00:35:57,173 --> 00:36:01,041
Let me play with you
using your beauty.

443
00:36:32,442 --> 00:36:39,442
Can any six pack hero give
a great craze & kick like you?

444
00:36:39,616 --> 00:36:46,616
Can any charming girl give a glamour
like you & compete with you in beauty?

445
00:36:47,123 --> 00:36:51,526
You've moved all
the handsome men in a side.

446
00:36:51,527 --> 00:36:54,229
You've turned my feelings
towards you, dear.

447
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:58,567
You've induced me to steal you.

448
00:36:58,568 --> 00:37:01,731
You've played the
volley ball game with me.

449
00:37:02,639 --> 00:37:06,769
You've taken away
as a train engine, man.

450
00:37:09,078 --> 00:37:12,948
I love you baby. You are my life.

451
00:37:12,949 --> 00:37:16,785
Let me play with you
using your beauty.

452
00:37:16,786 --> 00:37:20,756
I love you, Barbie. You're my lover.

453
00:37:20,757 --> 00:37:25,194
I'll give my beauty in your hands.

454
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:34,300
What? - Will there be
twins in the world?

455
00:37:34,301 --> 00:37:37,800
- Why twins? 7 people
will be alike in world.

456
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:43,545
7 people, grandma...?
- Yes, dear.

457
00:37:43,546 --> 00:37:45,598
You grandpa & I have
seen a guy in petrol

458
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:47,649
bunk, who resembles
your uncle exactly.

459
00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:51,053
Is it so? We also had seen
a boy like Krishna selling flowers.

460
00:37:51,054 --> 00:37:54,890
We also had seen a guy exactly
like Krishna walking on the rope.

461
00:37:54,891 --> 00:37:57,985
- Am I right?
- Lt means... Are there

462
00:38:00,163 --> 00:38:01,997
You don't have intelligence, sir.

463
00:38:01,998 --> 00:38:06,101
Is it? - That's why Rs. 2000 in your
salary from this month... - Sir! - Cut!

464
00:38:06,102 --> 00:38:09,237
7 people will resemble the same
in the world. It's true.

465
00:38:09,238 --> 00:38:13,971
But 3 of them are roaming in Panchagutlu
in Hyderabad. That's a wonder.

466
00:38:15,011 --> 00:38:17,793
It means...
- We suspect that our younger

467
00:38:17,794 --> 00:38:20,574
sir is playing different rolls drama.

468
00:38:24,587 --> 00:38:26,089
Okay. Who are there in your family?

469
00:38:26,090 --> 00:38:28,023
Oh! That's a great cricket team.

470
00:38:29,926 --> 00:38:32,622
Is your mother, a house wife?
- No. My dad's wife.

471
00:38:33,196 --> 00:38:36,164
Not that. What is she doing?

472
00:38:36,165 --> 00:38:38,667
How can a poor lady
have a great business?

473
00:38:38,668 --> 00:38:44,239
My mom is selling green
chilly Bujjis. - Bujjis...?

474
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:47,175
Oh pity!
- My sister is selling vegetables.

475
00:38:49,178 --> 00:38:52,814
My sister-in-law is selling flower
& coconuts near the temple.

476
00:38:52,815 --> 00:38:54,182
- Meena!
- Are you okay?

477
00:38:54,183 --> 00:38:55,784
What is your brother-in-law doing?

478
00:38:55,785 --> 00:38:59,988
That idiotic brother-in-law
is ironing clothes.

479
00:38:59,989 --> 00:39:01,623
What a shame! Let me die.

480
00:39:01,624 --> 00:39:03,615
- Your brother!
- Lorry...!

481
00:39:04,727 --> 00:39:06,728
He is telling richly about me.

482
00:39:06,729 --> 00:39:07,923
He has a great affection on me.

483
00:39:08,831 --> 00:39:11,050
Does your brother have a lorry?

484
00:39:11,051 --> 00:39:13,268
- Not lorry. He will be
loading luggage in lorry.

485
00:39:16,639 --> 00:39:20,142
Leave them. They are
earning doing tough jobs.

486
00:39:20,143 --> 00:39:22,844
It's true. My mom is a poor lady.

487
00:39:22,845 --> 00:39:25,279
My dad is hard worker.
My sister-in-law is a cleaver worker.

488
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,383
Sister is blind worker.
My brother-in-law is a timing worker.

489
00:39:27,384 --> 00:39:31,019
Your brother...? - Chiranjeevi.
That's simple worker.

490
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:35,057
Don't feel for it. I'd like
to see your family only once.

491
00:39:35,058 --> 00:39:36,993
Okay. Let me bring them
to Birla temple by tomorrow.

492
00:39:36,994 --> 00:39:40,095
Birla temple...? No need.
That's a millionaires temple.

493
00:39:40,096 --> 00:39:43,865
Poor people won't come there.
- Is there partiality in temples too?

494
00:39:43,866 --> 00:39:47,002
Yes. You bring them to Rama's
temple in Krishna Nagar.

495
00:39:47,003 --> 00:39:50,005
Okay. - Will your family members
come stopping their work?

496
00:39:50,006 --> 00:39:51,374
My family members have
a great affection on me. Right?

497
00:39:51,375 --> 00:39:53,810
I'm their soul. If they
have to sacrifice their

498
00:39:53,811 --> 00:39:56,244
soul for me, they will
compete to sacrifice.

499
00:39:56,245 --> 00:40:00,215
If I give them signal, that's enough.
Everybody will come by only share auto.

500
00:40:00,216 --> 00:40:01,417
Why do you worry? I'll bring them.

501
00:40:01,418 --> 00:40:02,714
Come on.

502
00:40:04,687 --> 00:40:08,214
Comrades! We'd not
co-operate him. - Okay.

503
00:40:09,025 --> 00:40:10,185
Live unity.

504
00:40:11,327 --> 00:40:14,663
Everybody has assembled here.
- Let me convince them. Hai, mom!

505
00:40:14,664 --> 00:40:15,731
Hai, sister-in-law!

506
00:40:15,732 --> 00:40:16,891
Hai, sister!

507
00:40:25,141 --> 00:40:27,909
Hear my words.
- Hello, brother-in-law!

508
00:40:27,910 --> 00:40:28,934
Hello, brother.

509
00:40:36,018 --> 00:40:38,286
Why are you people terrific today?

510
00:40:38,287 --> 00:40:40,723
Why do you ask about us?
Tell us the matter first.

511
00:40:40,724 --> 00:40:44,159
Nothing, brother-in-law. You'd help me.

512
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,287
Leave my buttons.
Tell me what I have to do.

513
00:40:47,330 --> 00:40:50,265
I think something has hurt you people.
What happened, brother?

514
00:40:50,733 --> 00:40:54,102
What, man?
Am I a luggage loader in lorry?

515
00:40:54,103 --> 00:40:58,073
What? Am I selling flowers
& coconuts in temple?

516
00:40:58,074 --> 00:41:01,042
- Am I a vegetable vendor?
- Stop it!

517
00:41:01,043 --> 00:41:03,745
I beg you all. Leave me, please.

518
00:41:03,746 --> 00:41:05,313
Who is that girl?

519
00:41:05,314 --> 00:41:08,416
Let me tell you. She's your co-sister.
She's your sister.

520
00:41:08,417 --> 00:41:10,786
She's your sister-in-law!
You know her relationship.

521
00:41:10,787 --> 00:41:13,121
- Sister! For you...
- Why are they?

522
00:41:13,122 --> 00:41:15,490
She's our daughter-in-law.
Is that all?

523
00:41:15,491 --> 00:41:20,862
What now! We'd come to Krishna Nagar
Rama temple & meet that girl. Right?

524
00:41:20,863 --> 00:41:22,731
My mom is a Manapuram gold.

525
00:41:22,732 --> 00:41:23,858
Enough, man.

526
00:41:26,769 --> 00:41:29,067
We are ready.

527
00:41:30,106 --> 00:41:31,773
We are also ready.

528
00:41:31,774 --> 00:41:34,910
Shall we go? Why did you
wear this suit & saree?

529
00:41:34,911 --> 00:41:36,412
Why do you look us like that?

530
00:41:36,413 --> 00:41:37,913
- We're not going for Kala
Mandir new shop opening.

531
00:41:37,914 --> 00:41:39,948
Why? Aren't our sarees good?

532
00:41:39,949 --> 00:41:43,518
Sarees are beautiful. But you have to
wear faded sarees. - We won't wear it.

533
00:41:43,519 --> 00:41:46,888
Please sister-in-law! For me.
- How can we get faded sarees now?

534
00:41:46,889 --> 00:41:49,324
Wait! Let me bring that to you.

535
00:41:49,325 --> 00:41:50,383
Come, man.

536
00:41:51,861 --> 00:41:54,429
What, boss?
Do you want the Tiff in again?

537
00:41:54,430 --> 00:41:56,489
- Not for Tiff in.
- Then...?

538
00:41:58,167 --> 00:42:04,834
How is this? - No. - That one...?

539
00:42:07,410 --> 00:42:11,813
The center piece...? - Why do
you look us like that, boss?

540
00:42:11,814 --> 00:42:14,339
Come on. You have to remove your
dresses urgently. You remove first.

541
00:42:15,351 --> 00:42:17,419
- No.
- We are not that type, sir.

542
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:20,255
Am I that type?
- I'm also not that type, sir.

543
00:42:20,256 --> 00:42:22,091
We're also not that type.
Do you have many

544
00:42:22,092 --> 00:42:23,925
- faded dresses?
- We've got more pieces.

545
00:42:23,926 --> 00:42:25,154
Go & get me that.

546
00:42:28,364 --> 00:42:30,999
- Here.
- We need this bag only.

547
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,168
If we give it to you, what can we wear?

548
00:42:32,169 --> 00:42:34,966
Here is Rs. 50,000. You people
purchase new dresses in this money.

549
00:42:38,341 --> 00:42:45,341
You're an offering king.
- Hey! No. - Boss! - No!

550
00:42:50,953 --> 00:42:53,289
Stop it, man. Slum dog
millionaires are waiting there.

551
00:42:53,290 --> 00:42:55,023
Come on.

552
00:42:55,024 --> 00:42:56,357
Here is the faded dresses bag.

553
00:42:56,358 --> 00:42:58,160
You select your own
choice from it & wear.

554
00:42:58,161 --> 00:43:02,290
Selection in torn dresses too...? Wear
something in this & come. - Yeah. Catch.

555
00:43:03,966 --> 00:43:05,433
Go & change it fast.

556
00:43:18,581 --> 00:43:24,486
How are we now? - You people are
too beautiful. Give me your hand.

557
00:43:24,487 --> 00:43:28,356
You...! - if I had known that
I'd have got this state...

558
00:43:28,357 --> 00:43:30,059
I'd have not come
as your house son-in-law.

559
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:33,495
You won't be fail to wear
this until I'm here. Come.

560
00:43:33,496 --> 00:43:36,829
Come.

561
00:43:40,202 --> 00:43:43,371
Rao sir will come. Give him
a cheque of 2 crores. Okay.

562
00:43:43,372 --> 00:43:44,873
Why didn't she come here yet?

563
00:43:44,874 --> 00:43:46,842
Is she a priest in this
temple to come in time?

564
00:43:49,945 --> 00:43:51,139
She's come.

565
00:44:03,059 --> 00:44:04,926
Uncle! Aunt is too cute.

566
00:44:04,927 --> 00:44:07,095
Come, Sathya.
We are waiting here for you.

567
00:44:07,096 --> 00:44:11,066
My mom! My sister!
My sister-in-law! My brother-in-law!

568
00:44:11,067 --> 00:44:12,625
- My brother!
- They are their children.

569
00:44:12,968 --> 00:44:15,095
- Greets!
- Greets!

570
00:44:23,479 --> 00:44:26,681
Why are you dresses torn like this?

571
00:44:26,682 --> 00:44:29,583
We didn't get a piece,
which is torn more than this.

572
00:44:30,586 --> 00:44:35,323
Sorry, aunty. I knew that you're poor.
But I didn't expect this level.

573
00:44:35,324 --> 00:44:39,194
We are not normal. We are too poor.

574
00:44:39,195 --> 00:44:43,264
Do you know who is the cause
for your poverty today?

575
00:44:43,265 --> 00:44:45,567
It's he only. What did he do?

576
00:44:45,568 --> 00:44:48,303
He only showed all
of them to you. Right?

577
00:44:48,304 --> 00:44:51,139
He means that. - Those millionaires
are the cause for your this situation.

578
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:54,337
Poor people are being suffered
for millionaires money thirsty.

579
00:44:54,944 --> 00:44:57,970
There are crores of black money
in their cup board.

580
00:45:02,084 --> 00:45:04,382
These are 500 crores. Be careful!

581
00:45:06,455 --> 00:45:11,324
There are many types of cars
in each & everybody's house.

582
00:45:19,001 --> 00:45:22,070
Costly sarees. - Pack that 10 lakhs
worth saree. - Okay, ma'am.

583
00:45:22,071 --> 00:45:25,039
Costly necklace.
- Pack that 2 crores necklace.

584
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:25,508
Okay, ma'am.

585
00:45:25,509 --> 00:45:28,476
Some people are becoming
millionaires abducting others money.

586
00:45:28,477 --> 00:45:32,313
Poor people are dying by poverty
because of millionaires money mind only.

587
00:45:32,314 --> 00:45:34,716
Millionaires are roaming
with haughtiness.

588
00:45:34,717 --> 00:45:37,948
We have to make them stand
in queue & shoot them.

589
00:45:40,990 --> 00:45:43,254
If you talk like this, we are fearing.

590
00:45:44,093 --> 00:45:45,427
Why do you fear, aunty?

591
00:45:45,428 --> 00:45:47,589
Our family members don't
know about violence.

592
00:45:48,264 --> 00:45:50,232
Pity! I've threatened
you unnecessarily.

593
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:54,162
I'll come to your house tomorrow.
Can you tell me your address?

594
00:45:54,570 --> 00:45:58,139
Address...? We don't know.
- Don't you know your address?

595
00:45:58,140 --> 00:46:01,075
I only know our address clearly.
Let me tell you. Come on.

596
00:46:01,076 --> 00:46:02,703
- Go.
- He will tell you.

597
00:46:12,087 --> 00:46:14,155
Is this a place, where people can stay?

598
00:46:14,156 --> 00:46:15,424
Why did you bring us here?

599
00:46:15,425 --> 00:46:17,016
To live here.

600
00:46:17,493 --> 00:46:21,129
Mom! You've seen the palace for all
these days. You're seeing the slum now.

601
00:46:21,130 --> 00:46:22,130
That's all.

602
00:46:22,631 --> 00:46:24,499
Come in. Welcome!

603
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:26,127
This is our palace.

604
00:46:27,169 --> 00:46:29,070
This is our poor house.

605
00:46:29,071 --> 00:46:31,372
- How is this?
- Is this a house, man?

606
00:46:31,373 --> 00:46:34,209
Oh man! Kill my character.
Let me run off.

607
00:46:34,210 --> 00:46:35,711
Is this a T. V serial
to kill your character?

608
00:46:35,712 --> 00:46:37,212
Please adjust for an hour.

609
00:46:37,213 --> 00:46:40,281
Did you tell her this address?
I've told her. She might be coming now.

610
00:46:40,282 --> 00:46:42,273
- Let's leave.
- See there.

611
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:46,354
Come on. Do some works.

612
00:46:46,355 --> 00:46:48,290
Kishore! Teach lessons to children.

613
00:46:48,291 --> 00:46:52,260
A means hunger. B means
liveliness. - Brother-in-law!

614
00:46:52,261 --> 00:46:53,662
I think petrol is over in this.

615
00:46:53,663 --> 00:46:55,425
How can we cook now, then?

616
00:47:00,269 --> 00:47:03,805
Come, dear. Is this your house?

617
00:47:03,806 --> 00:47:07,075
Hey! Don't you believe it? Do you
think that we are playing a drama?

618
00:47:07,076 --> 00:47:09,377
My brother is doing comedy.

619
00:47:09,378 --> 00:47:12,514
Poor people won't play dramas.
Millionaires only will play drama.

620
00:47:12,515 --> 00:47:15,216
- Dear!
- I've brought it for you.

621
00:47:15,217 --> 00:47:16,775
Take it. Dresses!

622
00:47:25,227 --> 00:47:26,426
Why are you looking like that?

623
00:47:26,427 --> 00:47:27,663
Don't you like these dresses?

624
00:47:27,664 --> 00:47:30,798
Why not? We never had seen
such dresses in our lifetime.

625
00:47:30,799 --> 00:47:32,300
- Am I right, mom?
- Yes, man.

626
00:47:32,301 --> 00:47:35,532
Zari work is also there.
- Feel happily.

627
00:47:35,804 --> 00:47:38,406
How can we feel happily
seeing these dresses?

628
00:47:38,407 --> 00:47:41,740
How our servants will feel, when
we offer them dresses? Feel like that.

629
00:47:43,612 --> 00:47:46,481
Here. Torn saree. Wear this
for junior N. T. R's marriage.

630
00:47:46,482 --> 00:47:48,649
Here. Wear this on Prabhu
& Nayanthara's marriage.

631
00:47:48,650 --> 00:47:50,586
Here. Wear this on Trisha's marriage.

632
00:47:50,587 --> 00:47:52,554
Wear this on somebody's marriage.

633
00:47:53,556 --> 00:47:58,393
Very happy, ma'am.
We never had worn such dresses.

634
00:47:58,394 --> 00:48:00,462
We didn't think that we'd see
such a dress in our lifetime.

635
00:48:00,463 --> 00:48:02,530
Don't worry. We also will
get a good time. - Yes.

636
00:48:02,531 --> 00:48:04,590
How can you get? Those millionaires
won't allow you to get it.

637
00:48:05,634 --> 00:48:08,537
She's started again.

638
00:48:08,538 --> 00:48:11,439
- Our children won't have books
to read & come up in life.

639
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:12,908
They won't have proper schools.

640
00:48:12,909 --> 00:48:17,211
They won't have food.
- Lt means food...? - Yes.

641
00:48:17,212 --> 00:48:19,237
We are eating Pizzas daily.

642
00:48:21,150 --> 00:48:23,418
That's bun pieces.

643
00:48:23,419 --> 00:48:27,446
Pity! They've thought
the bread pieces as Pizza.

644
00:48:28,624 --> 00:48:30,615
You've found out it.

645
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:33,895
Okay. I didn't see
your father until now.

646
00:48:33,896 --> 00:48:34,863
What is he doing?

647
00:48:36,231 --> 00:48:40,691
He is selling bananas moving
to each & every streets.

648
00:48:42,871 --> 00:48:46,705
Banana! Banana!

649
00:48:47,710 --> 00:48:49,837
Pity! Scoundrel!

650
00:48:51,814 --> 00:48:53,615
He is the base of our family.

651
00:48:53,616 --> 00:49:00,616
He is keep on moving his banana vehicle
not to stop our life like vehicle.

652
00:49:01,523 --> 00:49:05,526
Banana! - Wait!
How much is this? - Rs. 30.

653
00:49:05,527 --> 00:49:06,695
Just a minute, sir.

654
00:49:06,696 --> 00:49:10,765
Can you give for Rs. 25?
- Rs. 25...? Sir! Just a minute!

655
00:49:10,766 --> 00:49:12,600
Can you give for Rs. 25 or not?

656
00:49:12,601 --> 00:49:14,902
I won't reduce from Rs. 30.
- Let me move, sir.

657
00:49:14,903 --> 00:49:17,639
Can't you give for Rs. 25? - I can't
reduce even a single paise, sir.

658
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:19,440
Hey! Idiot! Don't you have sense?

659
00:49:19,441 --> 00:49:21,693
Let me move it, sir. - Can
you stop your vehicle

660
00:49:21,694 --> 00:49:23,945
in the middle for your
useless business?

661
00:49:23,946 --> 00:49:25,312
Let me move it now itself, sir.

662
00:49:25,313 --> 00:49:26,315
Do you know my time value?

663
00:49:26,316 --> 00:49:30,852
For how many times I have to tell you?
Let me move it, sir. Move, man.

664
00:49:30,853 --> 00:49:32,686
Let's talk there after
moving my vehicle.

665
00:49:32,687 --> 00:49:34,490
How it will be if you are so angry?

666
00:49:34,491 --> 00:49:35,684
Move.

667
00:49:57,379 --> 00:49:59,646
Why this dress? You've dressed
yourself like a bridegroom.

668
00:49:59,647 --> 00:50:00,916
Is today your wedding day?

669
00:50:00,917 --> 00:50:02,650
No, sir. My birthday.

670
00:50:02,651 --> 00:50:05,253
Are you a Nepal king
to celebrate your birthday?

671
00:50:05,254 --> 00:50:06,954
You're an after all driver.

672
00:50:06,955 --> 00:50:08,684
Can you also celebrate your birthday?

673
00:50:09,858 --> 00:50:14,862
What, man? Can't drivers take birth
& can't they celebrate their birthday?

674
00:50:14,863 --> 00:50:19,232
You give us a less salary
& ordering us too, idiot.

675
00:50:21,003 --> 00:50:23,271
Why are you looking me
like beating me?

676
00:50:23,272 --> 00:50:26,941
We live under your feet.
How can we beat you, sir?

677
00:50:26,942 --> 00:50:30,605
You laborers are
haughty people? Come.

678
00:50:32,848 --> 00:50:36,050
Sir! We have a cheque,
what our ma'am should pass urgently.

679
00:50:36,051 --> 00:50:37,853
Ma'am has not yet come to the office.

680
00:50:37,854 --> 00:50:39,654
- Didn't she come?
- Yes, sir.

681
00:50:39,655 --> 00:50:41,782
Sister! Do you want lip stick
for this dress to?

682
00:50:44,426 --> 00:50:45,960
I'll call you later on.

683
00:50:45,961 --> 00:50:49,564
Auto! All of you get in.
Sister! You sit here.

684
00:50:49,565 --> 00:50:53,835
Not comfortable. Is this a costly car
for comfort? It's an auto. Sit here.

685
00:50:53,836 --> 00:50:55,804
Boss! Go to Krishna Nagar.

686
00:50:56,772 --> 00:50:58,506
Follow that auto.

687
00:50:58,507 --> 00:51:00,809
Sir! I think everybody is going
for picnic by auto.

688
00:51:00,810 --> 00:51:02,401
Why did they get this fate?

689
00:51:08,684 --> 00:51:10,743
My brother-in-law is cute in this
dress instead of suit. Right?

690
00:51:11,887 --> 00:51:14,685
Stop here. Stop!

691
00:51:16,358 --> 00:51:17,893
Hai, Sathya. - How long it is
since you came here?

692
00:51:17,894 --> 00:51:19,427
Just now, aunty. Where did you go?

693
00:51:19,428 --> 00:51:20,829
- Big Bazaar.
- Vegetable bazaar.

694
00:51:20,830 --> 00:51:27,830
We went to vegetable bazaar
& came back with empty hands.

695
00:51:38,514 --> 00:51:40,615
How did such a rich car
come to this colony?

696
00:51:40,616 --> 00:51:41,548
Why car?

697
00:51:44,419 --> 00:51:45,545
Hai, grandpa.

698
00:51:46,555 --> 00:51:48,853
Is he your dad?
- No. Their grandpa.

699
00:51:49,892 --> 00:51:55,663
My dad only. Dad! Have you sold
all the bananas & bought this car?

700
00:51:55,664 --> 00:51:57,965
I'll break your teeth.

701
00:51:57,966 --> 00:52:00,802
Yes. If bananas ripe too much,
it will get spoiled.

702
00:52:00,803 --> 00:52:03,571
Dad! Punish me well after going home.

703
00:52:03,572 --> 00:52:04,671
Don't say me anything here alone.

704
00:52:04,672 --> 00:52:05,707
Please, let me beg you.

705
00:52:05,708 --> 00:52:07,975
Dear! Our Krishna is in love
on that girl.

706
00:52:07,976 --> 00:52:09,895
She doesn't like millionaires.

707
00:52:09,896 --> 00:52:11,813
- Are you people acting
like poor for that?

708
00:52:11,814 --> 00:52:15,616
Yes. He told that you're also
doing banana business.

709
00:52:15,617 --> 00:52:17,984
Banana business. - Let's change
that as apple business.

710
00:52:17,985 --> 00:52:19,621
It will be rich, won't it be?
- Shut up!

711
00:52:19,622 --> 00:52:22,089
Not that, uncle.
You see that girl only once.

712
00:52:22,090 --> 00:52:23,819
You'll like her definitely.
- Yes, dad.

713
00:52:27,429 --> 00:52:29,597
That girl...?
- Yes, brother-in-law.

714
00:52:29,598 --> 00:52:32,733
She is roaming to distribute
millionaires money to poor people.

715
00:52:32,734 --> 00:52:35,970
Do you know her? - I know her.
But she doesn't know me.

716
00:52:35,971 --> 00:52:37,131
Oh god! Escaped!

717
00:52:38,974 --> 00:52:40,464
Just a minute, dad.

718
00:52:41,543 --> 00:52:46,810
Why is your father looking like
a millionaire wearing suit & boot?

719
00:52:48,550 --> 00:52:50,618
My dad is having a millionaire friend.

720
00:52:50,619 --> 00:52:52,820
He used to offer his
old clothes to my dad.

721
00:52:52,821 --> 00:52:55,671
Who is he? - Sugirama Reddy!
- Who is he?

722
00:52:55,672 --> 00:52:58,521
- The one, who is
standing near that car.

723
00:53:01,029 --> 00:53:02,894
He's my father's childhood friend.

724
00:53:04,967 --> 00:53:07,765
Shall we tell him my poverty
removing concept?

725
00:53:08,871 --> 00:53:11,066
She's irritating me.

726
00:53:11,573 --> 00:53:14,542
Why don't you talk to me?
- Not now, Sathya.

727
00:53:14,543 --> 00:53:15,771
Let's tell him later on.

728
00:53:16,812 --> 00:53:18,143
Okay. Let me leave.

729
00:53:21,183 --> 00:53:24,118
Greets, uncle. How is your business?

730
00:53:24,119 --> 00:53:27,680
- Banana business!
- Shit!

731
00:53:47,809 --> 00:53:51,745
What is he doing?
- He's doing Yoga to control his anger.

732
00:53:53,515 --> 00:53:55,608
My anger is not getting
controlled at any cost.

733
00:53:57,019 --> 00:53:58,853
Did you people turn as a mad?

734
00:53:58,854 --> 00:53:59,955
What are you looking at me?

735
00:53:59,956 --> 00:54:02,690
As Krishna likes that girl...!

736
00:54:02,691 --> 00:54:05,160
Is it enough if he alone likes her?
I want

737
00:54:05,161 --> 00:54:07,628
a doll also should
costly in this house.

738
00:54:07,629 --> 00:54:10,996
How did you think that I could
accept her as my daughter-in-law?

739
00:54:15,837 --> 00:54:19,507
He's told that I'm a banana
vendor for his love.

740
00:54:19,508 --> 00:54:24,178
He will tell you people as Bujji,
vegetables & flower vendors in future.

741
00:54:24,179 --> 00:54:25,578
He's told that only already, dad.

742
00:54:27,916 --> 00:54:32,553
She is not so beautiful like Aishwarya
Rai to marry her playing drama.

743
00:54:32,554 --> 00:54:35,785
She is not a rich girl,
who has come from Ambani family.

744
00:54:36,692 --> 00:54:42,129
I want to be the topper
in world richest people's list.

745
00:54:42,130 --> 00:54:45,630
She has an idea to share
millionaires properties

746
00:54:45,631 --> 00:54:49,130
to poor people & make them also poor.

747
00:54:51,073 --> 00:54:54,873
That girl is not our daughter-in-law
even if the whole earth gets broken.

748
00:55:00,849 --> 00:55:02,345
If she doesn't become
our daughter-in-law,

749
00:55:02,346 --> 00:55:03,841
our family will get broken.

750
00:55:13,128 --> 00:55:18,259
We have hundred crores here. You people
tell me your daily social service.

751
00:55:20,669 --> 00:55:23,704
We can't say. Because we don't
know about social service at all.

752
00:55:23,705 --> 00:55:26,173
But Sathya is doing at least
one social service per day.

753
00:55:27,576 --> 00:55:33,572
I thought her helping heart as great
than our idle currency bank balance.

754
00:55:34,349 --> 00:55:37,184
Happiness that I didn't get
while roaming in your A/c car...

755
00:55:37,185 --> 00:55:39,016
I got that happiness
while acting for her.

756
00:55:40,322 --> 00:55:43,591
With the belief as you people
will understand my love...

757
00:55:43,592 --> 00:55:44,692
I loved her.

758
00:55:44,693 --> 00:55:46,193
I'll marry only Sathya.

759
00:55:46,194 --> 00:55:48,992
This is not my opinion.
Decision & that is final.

760
00:56:01,109 --> 00:56:06,614
Dear! How we love our Krishna!
Krishna also loves her that much!

761
00:56:06,615 --> 00:56:09,311
Don't deny their love. Please.

762
00:56:10,852 --> 00:56:14,288
What can I alone do, when you
people have joined together?

763
00:56:15,157 --> 00:56:18,125
- You proceed, then.
- Thanks, dear.

764
00:56:18,126 --> 00:56:21,118
Do you know anything about her family?

765
00:57:42,978 --> 00:57:45,071
Hey! Kill that idiot!

766
00:58:11,473 --> 00:58:13,964
Hey! Come, guys. Let's run off.

767
00:58:16,178 --> 00:58:20,014
Hey! Who are you?
- Hey! Don't leave him.

768
00:58:20,015 --> 00:58:23,143
Hey! Leave me! Sathya!

769
00:58:26,321 --> 00:58:27,720
Leave me!

770
00:58:46,975 --> 00:58:49,170
Brother! I've brought Sathya.

771
00:59:15,237 --> 00:59:17,228
Who has tied her?
- It's me only, brother.

772
00:59:18,206 --> 00:59:21,039
Do you think her as our
enemy's daughter to tie her?

773
00:59:21,876 --> 00:59:23,173
My daughter!

774
00:59:25,447 --> 00:59:29,516
What's this, dear? For how many
times you will run off from our house?

775
00:59:29,517 --> 00:59:31,852
I thought that my mom only
took birth again.

776
00:59:31,853 --> 00:59:34,054
If anything happens to you,
can I be alive?

777
00:59:34,055 --> 00:59:35,289
Tell me, dear.

778
00:59:35,290 --> 00:59:38,790
If you don't share your
properties & crores

779
00:59:38,791 --> 00:59:42,290
of money poor people,
I'll run off again.

780
00:59:44,165 --> 00:59:46,301
How can we live after sharing
our properties totally?

781
00:59:46,302 --> 00:59:49,828
How can I make your marriage?
- I'll save you.

782
00:59:50,572 --> 00:59:55,309
If you ask about my marriage...
l love a guy.

783
00:59:55,310 --> 01:00:00,304
Are you loving a guy?
Who is he? I'll chop him into pieces.

784
01:00:04,052 --> 01:00:06,452
- Who is he?
- He is very poor.

785
01:00:12,460 --> 01:00:15,863
What's this? It's looking
like a villain house.

786
01:00:15,864 --> 01:00:17,298
How can I get inside?

787
01:00:17,299 --> 01:00:19,633
Not only him. I like his family too.

788
01:00:19,634 --> 01:00:20,965
- Brother!
- Where do you take me?

789
01:00:24,172 --> 01:00:27,408
He is roaming here and there
in front of our house.

790
01:00:27,409 --> 01:00:28,933
That's why I have suspected him
& brought him here.

791
01:00:31,179 --> 01:00:32,614
Are you people human beings or robots?

792
01:00:32,615 --> 01:00:34,481
Can you kidnap a girl?

793
01:00:34,482 --> 01:00:39,286
Do you know her background
actually? She's an orphan.

794
01:00:39,287 --> 01:00:42,120
Poor girl!

795
01:00:43,058 --> 01:00:45,426
Do you know who is she?
His daughter.

796
01:00:45,427 --> 01:00:47,928
Do you know him? Naginidu!

797
01:00:47,929 --> 01:00:51,165
50% of properties in this Kurnool,
is his properties.

798
01:00:51,166 --> 01:00:52,498
He's an owner of crores of money.

799
01:00:52,499 --> 01:00:53,524
She is his daughter.

800
01:00:55,303 --> 01:00:57,639
Are you a millionaire?
- No. My dad is a millionaire.

801
01:00:57,640 --> 01:01:00,674
If Chiranjeevi is a millionaire,
is not Ramcharan a millionaire?

802
01:01:00,675 --> 01:01:03,544
If Dr. D. Ramanaidu is a millionaire,
is not Venkatesh sir a millionaire?

803
01:01:03,545 --> 01:01:06,146
If Nagarjun sir is a millionaire,
is not Nagachetan a millionaire?

804
01:01:06,147 --> 01:01:07,449
You tell me about you first.

805
01:01:07,450 --> 01:01:10,976
I loved him only.
His name is poor Krishna.

806
01:01:15,323 --> 01:01:19,026
What is your father's business?
- His dad is doing banana business.

807
01:01:19,027 --> 01:01:21,694
His mom's is doing Bujji business.
His sister is doing vegetable business.

808
01:01:21,695 --> 01:01:23,229
His brother-in-law is
doing ironing business.

809
01:01:23,230 --> 01:01:24,497
His sister-in-law is
doing flowers business.

810
01:01:24,498 --> 01:01:25,633
I'm doing petrol filling business.

811
01:01:25,634 --> 01:01:29,236
It's not a business.
It's a laborer? S work for survival.

812
01:01:29,237 --> 01:01:31,103
Brother! Total family
is a cheap business.

813
01:01:31,104 --> 01:01:32,968
I don't like them.

814
01:01:34,476 --> 01:01:37,711
Look, dear. My daughter likes you.

815
01:01:37,712 --> 01:01:40,579
That's all. It means I too like you.

816
01:01:48,456 --> 01:01:53,587
If Venkatapa's people
have attacked before us...

817
01:01:55,630 --> 01:01:58,098
Just miss, brother.

818
01:02:04,406 --> 01:02:09,276
Useless dogs! You're not useful
for any work instead of taking meat.

819
01:02:09,277 --> 01:02:12,012
Narasimha came there & saved her
at the murdering time, brother.

820
01:02:12,013 --> 01:02:17,508
If I think about it, I think somebody
is leaking our matter there.

821
01:02:20,021 --> 01:02:20,680
Venkatapa brother!

822
01:02:22,090 --> 01:02:25,058
What, Durga? What's the matter?

823
01:02:25,059 --> 01:02:27,561
If he finds that I'm only
passing his information here...

824
01:02:27,562 --> 01:02:30,292
That Naginidu will remove
your head also along with mine.

825
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:36,737
Nobody is brave there
to remove our heads.

826
01:02:36,738 --> 01:02:42,540
That Naginidu will die by my hands
only as a revenge of killing my grandpa.

827
01:02:54,022 --> 01:02:55,223
Tell me, Durga.

828
01:02:55,224 --> 01:02:59,092
Naginidu is leaving to Hyderabad
regarding his daughter's marriage.

829
01:02:59,093 --> 01:03:01,027
This is the correct time to attack him.

830
01:03:06,301 --> 01:03:08,002
What? There are many
people around your house.

831
01:03:08,003 --> 01:03:09,703
They are having sickles in hands.

832
01:03:09,704 --> 01:03:12,172
Do you belong to any
king's hereditary?

833
01:03:12,173 --> 01:03:15,006
No. - Is your father doing
a sickle business?

834
01:03:15,276 --> 01:03:19,613
No. - Then? - My dad is a great
factionist. - Factionist...?

835
01:03:19,614 --> 01:03:21,181
It means... Raktha Charithra!

836
01:03:21,182 --> 01:03:23,050
Part 1 or 2...?

837
01:03:23,051 --> 01:03:25,485
Oh god! It's like part 3!

838
01:03:33,061 --> 01:03:33,584
Oh god!

839
01:03:42,470 --> 01:03:46,236
Hey! Bring your sickles
& finish those rowdies.

840
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:07,125
Sathya! Come!

841
01:04:16,538 --> 01:04:19,200
- Dad!
- Sathya!

842
01:04:40,428 --> 01:04:43,522
Hey! We'd take her to hospital.
Start the jeep. - Okay, brother.

843
01:05:16,931 --> 01:05:20,230
Hey! I've come to fight with you.
Why did you run off without seeing me?

844
01:05:37,452 --> 01:05:38,752
Hey! Is that you?

845
01:05:38,753 --> 01:05:40,311
Betrayer!

846
01:05:41,489 --> 01:05:44,890
What should I do his hand now?
- Give him. - Keep it safely.

847
01:05:46,794 --> 01:05:48,489
Stop it near that tractor.

848
01:05:50,331 --> 01:05:51,821
Stop it here.

849
01:05:57,939 --> 01:05:59,702
Come on.

850
01:06:08,282 --> 01:06:13,379
- Dash him and murder him.
- Dash him!

851
01:06:23,923 --> 01:06:25,982
Come on. Catch our tractor!

852
01:06:30,463 --> 01:06:34,700
Who is he? - Naginidu's future
son-in-law it seems.

853
01:06:34,701 --> 01:06:36,403
He is staying in Hyderabad it seems.

854
01:06:36,404 --> 01:06:38,570
- You man!
- Tata!

855
01:06:38,571 --> 01:06:40,801
You will die by my hands only.

856
01:07:02,930 --> 01:07:07,567
You don't feel, dear. I won't leave
them, who have attacked our family.

857
01:07:07,568 --> 01:07:09,870
I'll murder them on the road.

858
01:07:09,871 --> 01:07:13,507
Not on the road, brother.
We'd strike their back bone.

859
01:07:13,508 --> 01:07:16,610
If you do rowdism like this, our family
members won't agree our marriage.

860
01:07:16,611 --> 01:07:19,780
We'd give consent to have your
cheap business family alliance.

861
01:07:19,781 --> 01:07:21,616
- Not you people.
- Don't get angry, sir.

862
01:07:21,617 --> 01:07:24,684
Our family members will get
fainted seeing the blood.

863
01:07:24,685 --> 01:07:28,855
Your family will attack others
bravely & see their blood always.

864
01:07:28,856 --> 01:07:30,949
- So what?
- Wait, Narasimha!

865
01:07:37,565 --> 01:07:38,965
What should we do now?

866
01:07:38,966 --> 01:07:40,751
If my family members
should not know you

867
01:07:40,752 --> 01:07:42,536
as a factionist, you
have to do as I say.

868
01:07:42,537 --> 01:07:45,639
Impossible. I've agreed
for your marriage, right?

869
01:07:45,640 --> 01:07:47,241
Do you think that I will act
according to your words?

870
01:07:47,242 --> 01:07:49,944
It's not a Dhuriyodhana
or Bheema's role.

871
01:07:49,945 --> 01:07:52,645
It's a poor man's role. I hate that.

872
01:07:53,881 --> 01:07:56,616
Dear! You did many things for him
from his childhood. Right?

873
01:07:56,617 --> 01:07:58,915
- Please. Act this time alone.
- No!

874
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:04,583
- Listen to me. Please.
- No. I won't act.

875
01:08:08,663 --> 01:08:11,599
If we stay in this house for 2 days, we
will get all the health problems freely.

876
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:14,601
I've got it already.
- They've come. - Come, uncle.

877
01:08:14,602 --> 01:08:16,636
- He's my dad.
- Greets, sir.

878
01:08:16,637 --> 01:08:18,537
Greets. Sit down, brother.

879
01:08:21,275 --> 01:08:24,978
Look, sir. - I'm seeing you only.
You tell me.

880
01:08:24,979 --> 01:08:28,081
Our elders say that we'd send
our daughter to a rich house...

881
01:08:28,082 --> 01:08:30,750
& take our bride from poor family.

882
01:08:30,751 --> 01:08:33,887
But the reason for sending
my daughter to such a poor family is...

883
01:08:33,888 --> 01:08:36,723
My daughter loves your son.
That's why...

884
01:08:36,724 --> 01:08:37,658
I'm also like that.

885
01:08:37,659 --> 01:08:41,261
I've agreed this marriage without any
interest as my son loved your daughter.

886
01:08:41,262 --> 01:08:44,165
Brother! He's giving
a pose like a multi

887
01:08:44,166 --> 01:08:47,067
millionaire even if he
is a banana vendor.

888
01:08:47,068 --> 01:08:48,869
He's bridegroom's father. Right?

889
01:08:48,870 --> 01:08:50,670
- What are you doing in
your native, brother?

890
01:08:50,671 --> 01:08:54,198
L... He's a head master
& he's a Mathematics master.

891
01:08:55,243 --> 01:08:57,211
Why did he say me as a head master?

892
01:08:57,212 --> 01:09:00,647
You remove your enemies heads.
So he says you as a head master.

893
01:09:00,648 --> 01:09:02,980
I'm counting those.
So I'm a Mathematics master.

894
01:09:03,050 --> 01:09:06,753
It means yours is
an educated family. - Yes.

895
01:09:06,754 --> 01:09:08,688
Are you the banana vendor?

896
01:09:13,794 --> 01:09:20,794
How much do you get per day?
- Rs. 100. - For you all...? - Rs. 100!

897
01:09:24,038 --> 01:09:25,672
What can we buy for Rs. 100?

898
01:09:25,673 --> 01:09:28,009
If we order people to produce
a knife itself, they demand us Rs. 200.

899
01:09:28,010 --> 01:09:31,001
Why knife?
- That's banana cutting knife.

900
01:09:34,749 --> 01:09:39,286
Is this your own house?
- No. It's a rental hut.

901
01:09:39,287 --> 01:09:44,190
Rental hut...? Brother!
Please come out just for a while.

902
01:09:44,191 --> 01:09:45,215
I'll be back now.

903
01:09:47,995 --> 01:09:50,623
What, man?
- Brother! Very poor family.

904
01:09:52,767 --> 01:09:56,236
Cheap business.
They don't have any own house also.

905
01:09:56,237 --> 01:09:59,639
Is this necessary for our daughter?
- We've got more money. Right?

906
01:09:59,640 --> 01:10:02,943
Let's make them to do rich business.
- Rich business...?

907
01:10:02,944 --> 01:10:05,174
If we face the loss in their business,
we also should push vegetable vehicle.

908
01:10:06,147 --> 01:10:07,681
What should I do now? Tell me.

909
01:10:07,682 --> 01:10:09,783
Brother! Let's do a thing.

910
01:10:09,784 --> 01:10:13,019
Let's stay here itself for a month
& observe their business well.

911
01:10:13,020 --> 01:10:15,121
Let's confirm this alliance after that.

912
01:10:15,122 --> 01:10:18,358
It's a good idea.
Let's tell them. Come.

913
01:10:18,359 --> 01:10:20,759
I think you've decided
to go to your native.

914
01:10:20,828 --> 01:10:22,929
- Very good. Hey! They've started.
- No!

915
01:10:22,930 --> 01:10:25,266
We've decided to stay here
for a month. - For a month...?

916
01:10:25,267 --> 01:10:26,900
You stay here. We will leave out.

917
01:10:26,901 --> 01:10:28,869
Sister! I think he is too
short tempered.

918
01:10:28,870 --> 01:10:30,905
Not that. If some
people sleep here, some

919
01:10:30,906 --> 01:10:32,939
people should sleep
sitting on the ground.

920
01:10:32,940 --> 01:10:34,807
If you also come here, everybody
should sleep standing like this.

921
01:10:34,808 --> 01:10:35,910
Why do we suffer like that, dad?

922
01:10:35,911 --> 01:10:38,845
You've got a millionaire friend.
Right? Let's go to his house.

923
01:10:38,846 --> 01:10:40,946
Let me convince him. Please.
- Who is my millionaire friend?

924
01:10:40,947 --> 01:10:42,677
It's you only, dad.
It's our house only.

925
01:10:43,217 --> 01:10:47,120
Come. All of you take your luggage.
Come fast. - Ln our house...?

926
01:10:47,121 --> 01:10:51,057
Oh my fate!
- We won't agree this, boss.

927
01:10:51,058 --> 01:10:53,126
Why? - We won't agree this. - Why?

928
01:10:53,127 --> 01:10:58,765
Not that. - Why? - If we act
as millionaires like how you told...

929
01:10:58,766 --> 01:11:01,868
We will be practiced in A/c rooms
& free cars drive, boss.

930
01:11:01,869 --> 01:11:05,772
We have to eat Pizzas in the daytime
& take wine in the nighttime.

931
01:11:05,773 --> 01:11:07,808
If we get practiced these
facilities, can we

932
01:11:07,809 --> 01:11:09,843
follow those in our
salary from next month?

933
01:11:09,844 --> 01:11:13,346
If we get practiced
wearing costly sarees...

934
01:11:13,347 --> 01:11:14,782
What will be our state, boss?

935
01:11:14,783 --> 01:11:19,352
If your job is over, you'll throw us
like an used cigarette.

936
01:11:19,353 --> 01:11:23,756
How do you know about our suffers
of becoming lean without rich food?

937
01:11:24,025 --> 01:11:26,693
I'll take care of you
without making you lean.

938
01:11:26,694 --> 01:11:28,184
Shit! Why do you take care of me?

939
01:11:28,729 --> 01:11:30,197
I've understood your feelings.

940
01:11:30,198 --> 01:11:33,733
Let me sanction your one month
comforts throughout your lifetime.

941
01:11:33,734 --> 01:11:36,703
- Boss!
- What happened again?

942
01:11:36,704 --> 01:11:42,742
Oh our king! - Stop it!
I've got a fate to hear this.

943
01:11:42,743 --> 01:11:44,545
Shut up! Hey! I'm
telling you now itself.

944
01:11:44,546 --> 01:11:46,346
Your acting should be realistic.

945
01:11:46,347 --> 01:11:52,081
Not only washing vessels.
We will play any role very well.

946
01:12:00,728 --> 01:12:03,263
I thought their friend's bungalow
as a ghost bungalow.

947
01:12:03,264 --> 01:12:04,465
It's very grand bungalow only.

948
01:12:04,466 --> 01:12:06,801
This is my friend's bungalow.
- Yes. This

949
01:12:06,802 --> 01:12:09,135
is not his bungalow.
That man's bungalow.

950
01:12:09,136 --> 01:12:10,771
We didn't ask you that matter. Right?

951
01:12:10,772 --> 01:12:13,763
Silence!
Millionaire Mithra sir is coming.

952
01:12:30,096 --> 01:12:31,358
Why is he falling down like this?

953
01:12:32,598 --> 01:12:35,624
Is he alive? - If he gets up,
he is alive it seems.

954
01:12:36,902 --> 01:12:39,271
What happened? - I wanted
to come down in a high range.

955
01:12:39,272 --> 01:12:42,140
You've fallen down in this range.
No over action. Mind your range.

956
01:12:42,141 --> 01:12:46,168
Get up! Nothing.
He's fallen down by mistake.

957
01:12:46,245 --> 01:12:48,347
He's millionaire Mithra.
- I'm millionaire Mithra!

958
01:12:48,348 --> 01:12:51,180
His name is Naginidu.
He's my in-law!

959
01:12:54,286 --> 01:12:58,518
He is looking like a painter.
Is he a house owner?

960
01:12:59,125 --> 01:13:01,992
This man & I were studied
in the same class in our childhood.

961
01:13:03,028 --> 01:13:05,196
I've become a great man
for my knowledge.

962
01:13:05,197 --> 01:13:10,435
This idiot didn't study well
& he is earning selling bananas.

963
01:13:10,436 --> 01:13:13,104
Although he is
my childhood friend. Right?

964
01:13:13,105 --> 01:13:15,073
That's why I've agreed you
people's stay here.

965
01:13:17,276 --> 01:13:21,980
Greets, sir. - This beautiful lady...
Is she beautiful?

966
01:13:21,981 --> 01:13:23,448
- She is my daughter.
- Greets, sir.

967
01:13:24,383 --> 01:13:27,519
They are my family members!
- Greets, boss.

968
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:31,022
Greets! Why is their slang, wrong?

969
01:13:31,023 --> 01:13:33,651
They are from East Godhavari.
So that is their slang.

970
01:13:34,493 --> 01:13:36,027
Krishna! Tell them.

971
01:13:36,028 --> 01:13:38,397
We've come home now itself. Right?
Let me tell him later on.

972
01:13:38,398 --> 01:13:39,955
No problem. Tell him!

973
01:13:40,332 --> 01:13:42,100
Why do you get afraid, dear?

974
01:13:42,101 --> 01:13:46,060
Tell me, man. - Nothing, sir.
You're a great millionaire. Right?

975
01:13:47,339 --> 01:13:48,674
That girl is having
some concepts it seems.

976
01:13:48,675 --> 01:13:51,110
Tell me. - Sir! There
are poor people, who

977
01:13:51,111 --> 01:13:53,545
take food once for 2
days in this country.

978
01:13:53,546 --> 01:13:57,248
Unlucky people, who die without
having small medical treatments also.

979
01:13:57,249 --> 01:13:58,448
There are more people like them.

980
01:13:58,449 --> 01:13:59,644
She's started again, uncle!

981
01:14:00,486 --> 01:14:03,354
Poor students, who had quit their
studies without paying their fees.

982
01:14:03,355 --> 01:14:06,524
Drivers, who work for silly salaries.

983
01:14:06,525 --> 01:14:10,628
Workers, who can't get even
Rs. 100 per day for their hard work.

984
01:14:10,629 --> 01:14:12,028
They are suffering a lot.

985
01:14:15,334 --> 01:14:16,596
What's this?

986
01:14:20,506 --> 01:14:22,607
Yes. We know about those suffers.

987
01:14:22,608 --> 01:14:25,310
We know about their painful stories.

988
01:14:25,311 --> 01:14:26,410
How do you people know about that?

989
01:14:26,411 --> 01:14:28,380
You people are millionaires,
aren't you? - Yes.

990
01:14:29,715 --> 01:14:33,785
So... if you donate 10 crores
to poor people, it will be good.

991
01:14:33,786 --> 01:14:35,515
Why only 10 crores?
Let me give you 20 crores.

992
01:14:35,721 --> 01:14:39,157
You man! Give me that cheque book.

993
01:14:39,158 --> 01:14:40,593
What does a cheque book mean?

994
01:14:40,594 --> 01:14:43,528
I'm writing & paying your salary
for every month. Right?

995
01:14:43,529 --> 01:14:45,690
Give me that book.
- Salary... For me?

996
01:14:46,532 --> 01:14:49,194
- Is it that?
- Hey deaf! Cheque book!

997
01:14:54,573 --> 01:14:56,475
Sir! You didn't write the amount in it.

998
01:14:56,476 --> 01:14:59,177
You write it.
- Okay. Your signature...?

999
01:14:59,178 --> 01:15:03,081
My servant will do such a silly job.
Sign in it, man. - Okay.

1000
01:15:03,082 --> 01:15:07,051
If he signs in his cheque leaf,
it won't be passed. Right?

1001
01:15:07,052 --> 01:15:09,654
If he signs, that won't be passed.
- Won't it be passed?

1002
01:15:09,655 --> 01:15:13,358
He's given you the cheque. Right? Let
me sign in it, when his mood is good.

1003
01:15:13,359 --> 01:15:15,384
Let show you the house.
Come! Come on!

1004
01:15:17,763 --> 01:15:20,098
Hey! Bangles! You are shoe!

1005
01:15:20,099 --> 01:15:22,192
Come. - Where?
- Let me tell you. Come!

1006
01:15:30,643 --> 01:15:33,211
- What's this?
- Don't you know this?

1007
01:15:33,212 --> 01:15:36,238
Romance! - Romance means...?
- Don't you know about romance?

1008
01:15:37,283 --> 01:15:38,773
Okay. Shall I teach you?

1009
01:16:53,225 --> 01:16:59,630
Hey! A star has come
from the sky for me now.

1010
01:16:59,631 --> 01:17:05,729
I'm like a milky moon.
I've got more affection on you.

1011
01:17:06,739 --> 01:17:13,739
She's like a star & flower.
I don't know how to explain her beauty.

1012
01:17:56,655 --> 01:18:02,855
Hey! Flower like girl!

1013
01:18:03,462 --> 01:18:10,301
I've seen a beautiful love
in your eyes.

1014
01:18:10,302 --> 01:18:16,935
You hug my beauty. I've got
immersed into your kiss like sea.

1015
01:18:19,978 --> 01:18:26,978
You're a beautiful statue.
Let me show the camphor to you.

1016
01:18:27,352 --> 01:18:34,352
There is no any place, where the sun
& moon got mingled together.

1017
01:19:42,828 --> 01:19:49,667
I was controlling my lustful
feelings for all these days.

1018
01:19:49,668 --> 01:19:56,403
Your smile is pure like the jasmine
flower. Shall I admire you?

1019
01:19:59,344 --> 01:20:06,083
My dreams are not yet over. I have
to dance with you for many more aeons.

1020
01:20:06,084 --> 01:20:13,084
There is no any place, where the war
& peace got mingled together.

1021
01:20:38,550 --> 01:20:42,687
Doing residential works, is too
tough than doing a business.

1022
01:20:42,688 --> 01:20:44,883
Hey! Look him!
He's sleeping here with snore.

1023
01:20:47,125 --> 01:20:54,125
This city has never seen such
a beautiful for all these days.

1024
01:20:55,601 --> 01:21:00,129
With shyness...
- Hey Arvindsamy! Stop it!

1025
01:21:07,079 --> 01:21:09,146
See how this pig is sleeping!

1026
01:21:09,147 --> 01:21:14,685
Get up! - If you beat us,
we won't act in our character.

1027
01:21:14,686 --> 01:21:16,787
- Hey wait!
- Leave him, dad.

1028
01:21:16,788 --> 01:21:18,380
I think everybody has got
involved in their characters well.

1029
01:21:20,792 --> 01:21:21,850
This phone is disturbing me.

1030
01:21:23,095 --> 01:21:24,153
Who is that?

1031
01:21:25,731 --> 01:21:29,667
He's routine only.
But he feels that he is too different.

1032
01:21:29,668 --> 01:21:32,053
He's planned to make
Sri Krishna as his

1033
01:21:32,054 --> 01:21:34,438
son-in-law & take over
their properties fully.

1034
01:21:34,439 --> 01:21:37,141
It's me Melimbangaru Reddy.

1035
01:21:37,142 --> 01:21:39,210
24 carats.
- We don't need you.

1036
01:21:39,211 --> 01:21:41,846
- Cut your call.
- Why, man?

1037
01:21:41,847 --> 01:21:43,515
Don't you understand
the meaning of Melimbangaru?

1038
01:21:43,516 --> 01:21:46,550
Bangaru uncle, man!
- Oh! America Bangaru...?

1039
01:21:46,551 --> 01:21:47,452
How are you, uncle?

1040
01:21:47,453 --> 01:21:50,087
Not as how. Ask me where are you.

1041
01:21:50,088 --> 01:21:52,590
Where will you be? I'll be there
near Buddha statue in Hyderabad.

1042
01:21:52,591 --> 01:21:54,660
You'll be there near statue
of Liberty in America.

1043
01:21:54,661 --> 01:21:57,754
You've done a mistake there only.
I'm there in front of your house, man.

1044
01:21:58,597 --> 01:21:59,896
Why did you come suddenly?

1045
01:21:59,897 --> 01:22:02,198
No any natural calamity will
come informing us in advance.

1046
01:22:02,199 --> 01:22:03,235
They will come suddenly only.

1047
01:22:03,236 --> 01:22:04,793
I've come to thrill you people.

1048
01:22:06,004 --> 01:22:07,538
Bangaru uncle has come to lndia.

1049
01:22:07,539 --> 01:22:09,140
- For what?
- To thrill us it seems.

1050
01:22:09,141 --> 01:22:11,439
Idiot! Isn't this thrill enough for us?

1051
01:22:12,077 --> 01:22:13,711
Uncle!

1052
01:22:13,712 --> 01:22:18,172
Hey Kishore! Look at there.

1053
01:22:20,085 --> 01:22:24,647
Oh my uncle!

1054
01:22:25,557 --> 01:22:28,559
Uncle! I've come to lndia
regarding my business.

1055
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:31,929
If you bless me through your hands,
I can get more profits, uncle.

1056
01:22:31,930 --> 01:22:36,067
Bless me, uncle.

1057
01:22:36,068 --> 01:22:38,836
How softly you're...!

1058
01:22:38,837 --> 01:22:42,206
Hey! You're just a driver.
Why do you bless me?

1059
01:22:42,207 --> 01:22:44,732
Why driver?
I'm the owner of this house.

1060
01:22:46,011 --> 01:22:47,511
Are you the owner?

1061
01:22:47,512 --> 01:22:48,843
Uncle! Uncle!

1062
01:22:50,015 --> 01:22:57,015
Who can guess about
the happening matters?

1063
01:22:59,024 --> 01:23:06,024
Who can get escaped
from the fate's play?

1064
01:23:07,299 --> 01:23:09,233
Brother! Are you fine?

1065
01:23:09,234 --> 01:23:11,920
I'm okay. Why are you
people looking like

1066
01:23:11,921 --> 01:23:14,605
this as a failed real
estate businessman?

1067
01:23:14,606 --> 01:23:16,424
Brother! Is there a
stinking cloth in your

1068
01:23:16,425 --> 01:23:18,242
hands through which you earned crores?

1069
01:23:18,243 --> 01:23:20,245
That's not a stinking cloth,
aunty. That's a dirty cloth.

1070
01:23:20,246 --> 01:23:21,679
Some cloth, man.

1071
01:23:21,680 --> 01:23:24,014
Tell me the reason
for your this position.

1072
01:23:24,015 --> 01:23:26,950
That's... - Why are you
people dumb? Answer me.

1073
01:23:35,260 --> 01:23:36,827
Talk to me. Answer me.

1074
01:23:36,828 --> 01:23:40,924
That's my dad played cards last night.
He lost his properties totally in that.

1075
01:23:44,169 --> 01:23:47,304
Did he lose thousands of crores
by gambling in one night?

1076
01:23:47,305 --> 01:23:48,707
That too, when this joker also played.

1077
01:23:48,708 --> 01:23:50,808
You...! Shut up!
- What can we do?

1078
01:23:50,809 --> 01:23:53,145
He only got the joker in the game.
I've failed in that.

1079
01:23:53,146 --> 01:23:56,647
Let him lose.
What were you people doing?

1080
01:23:56,648 --> 01:23:58,750
We people played altogether.
- Did you people play altogether?

1081
01:23:58,751 --> 01:24:01,585
Is this a holy festival
to play altogether?

1082
01:24:01,586 --> 01:24:04,588
It's a gambling. If we get failed,
our life will get turned totally.

1083
01:24:04,589 --> 01:24:10,961
If I see you all, I'm getting irritated.
- No. You'd say as you feel for them.

1084
01:24:10,962 --> 01:24:12,664
You've grown up well.
But your brain didn't get developed.

1085
01:24:12,665 --> 01:24:16,934
Uncle! Ups & downs are common in life.

1086
01:24:16,935 --> 01:24:19,130
I didn't think that
you'd become so down.

1087
01:24:20,639 --> 01:24:23,207
Here! Take this Rs. 1000 & buy dresses.

1088
01:24:23,208 --> 01:24:25,293
You'd not play cards in this money.
If you

1089
01:24:25,294 --> 01:24:27,378
- play, this useless will win.
- Hey you!

1090
01:24:27,379 --> 01:24:28,712
Shut your mouth!

1091
01:24:28,713 --> 01:24:31,982
Dad! Is my marriage fixed
with my uncle? - It's fixed, dear.

1092
01:24:31,983 --> 01:24:33,151
You get fixed with him.

1093
01:24:33,152 --> 01:24:36,620
We have to play cards
outside together.

1094
01:24:36,621 --> 01:24:38,322
Come! She's got fixed it seems.

1095
01:24:38,323 --> 01:24:40,223
You come, dear. You also come.

1096
01:24:43,862 --> 01:24:47,832
Selfish fellow! Did you see how
he has changed after mistaking us?

1097
01:24:47,833 --> 01:24:48,731
Leave him.

1098
01:24:48,732 --> 01:24:50,184
We've got an opportunity to understand

1099
01:24:50,185 --> 01:24:51,636
people's real face
because of this get up.

1100
01:24:51,637 --> 01:24:54,271
What, in-law? Didn't you go out
for your business until now?

1101
01:24:54,272 --> 01:24:57,641
We are leaving out, in-law! Let's go.

1102
01:24:57,642 --> 01:25:00,711
I also should go to office. Come.
- Do you say that as necessary?

1103
01:25:00,712 --> 01:25:02,780
I've got involved with
my character, man.

1104
01:25:02,781 --> 01:25:06,150
You're acting too much. If you don't
reduce it, I'll cut your matter.

1105
01:25:06,151 --> 01:25:07,718
Let me leave, uncle.

1106
01:25:07,719 --> 01:25:09,687
- Let's go.
- Come on!

1107
01:25:10,922 --> 01:25:13,958
Ln-law's family has gone
out for their business.

1108
01:25:13,959 --> 01:25:16,994
Let's also go & watch their business.

1109
01:25:16,995 --> 01:25:19,190
Let's watch our in-law's
sales first. Come.

1110
01:25:20,966 --> 01:25:22,695
- Keep this bike.
- Okay, sir.

1111
01:25:27,105 --> 01:25:30,174
Dad! You have to come out
with me urgently.

1112
01:25:30,175 --> 01:25:34,011
Where? - Head master has come out
to watch your banana business.

1113
01:25:34,012 --> 01:25:37,047
If you sell the bananas in market
for sometime, this danger will go off.

1114
01:25:37,048 --> 01:25:39,684
I won't come, man. - Please, dad. If you
don't come, our marriage won't happen.

1115
01:25:39,685 --> 01:25:43,176
Let me hold your feet.
Please, dad. For us...! - Okay.

1116
01:25:49,394 --> 01:25:50,694
Dad! Not that way!

1117
01:25:50,695 --> 01:25:52,390
This way!

1118
01:25:54,332 --> 01:25:56,266
You be into the car.
Let me make your pushcart ready.

1119
01:25:59,337 --> 01:26:02,907
Bananas! Dozen if for Rs. 25. Come!

1120
01:26:02,908 --> 01:26:05,043
For how much you can sell this
pushcart along with these fruits?

1121
01:26:05,044 --> 01:26:06,977
Rs. 5000. Can you buy it?

1122
01:26:06,978 --> 01:26:11,347
Here is Rs. 10,000. You have it
& go leaving your cart here.

1123
01:26:12,884 --> 01:26:14,317
- Thank you, sir.
- Go.

1124
01:26:17,255 --> 01:26:19,348
- You can come.
- Okay!

1125
01:26:31,069 --> 01:26:33,737
Do you know who am I?
- Why should I bother about you, man?

1126
01:26:33,738 --> 01:26:35,069
You're looking like a banana vendor.

1127
01:26:37,175 --> 01:26:41,812
- Come, dad.
- Have they come?

1128
01:26:41,813 --> 01:26:42,912
They have not yet come, dad.

1129
01:26:42,913 --> 01:26:45,148
I'll leave in an hours time
whether they come or not.

1130
01:26:45,149 --> 01:26:46,484
You've brought me here
before when I take my lunch.

1131
01:26:46,485 --> 01:26:50,254
I'm hungry. - Shall I get you Pizza?
- Here...? I don't want it.

1132
01:26:50,255 --> 01:26:53,958
- Do you want to eat banana?
- No.

1133
01:26:53,959 --> 01:26:56,325
Okay. They can come here at
any time. You start your sales.

1134
01:26:57,195 --> 01:26:59,062
How can I sell these,
when no customer has come here?

1135
01:26:59,063 --> 01:27:00,932
Customers won't come, dad.
You only should call them.

1136
01:27:00,933 --> 01:27:02,456
- You call them.
- Oh!

1137
01:27:02,968 --> 01:27:04,568
Banana!

1138
01:27:09,040 --> 01:27:11,775
Dad! If you call stylish like this,
no customer will come.

1139
01:27:11,776 --> 01:27:12,810
Watch me now.

1140
01:27:12,811 --> 01:27:16,914
Sweet banana fruits!
Come, guys. Cheap rate!

1141
01:27:16,915 --> 01:27:21,151
You'd shout like this. - Your love may
die or not. I won't shout so.

1142
01:27:21,152 --> 01:27:23,253
Please, dad. This time alone. For me.

1143
01:27:23,254 --> 01:27:26,323
How much is per dozen?
- Why did he come here?

1144
01:27:26,324 --> 01:27:28,892
He's looking like my boss.
No. Impossible!

1145
01:27:28,893 --> 01:27:33,497
You're looking like my boss son.
- Your brain is too poor, sir.

1146
01:27:33,498 --> 01:27:35,899
It means... Is he my boss?

1147
01:27:35,900 --> 01:27:38,095
Why is this get up, then?
- Not get up! Set up!

1148
01:27:39,838 --> 01:27:42,339
I'm going to do a banana
business. It's a practice.

1149
01:27:42,340 --> 01:27:44,141
You're a superb businessman, sir.

1150
01:27:44,142 --> 01:27:46,872
How much is per dozen?
- Rs. 200 only.

1151
01:27:47,212 --> 01:27:52,049
Rs. 200 only...? I think you don't have
enough experience in banana business.

1152
01:27:52,050 --> 01:27:54,152
If you demand such a high amount,
your business will get spoiled.

1153
01:27:54,153 --> 01:27:57,087
If I start a banana business,
I will sell these for Rs. 200.

1154
01:27:57,088 --> 01:27:59,590
Can't you buy it?
- They sell it just Rs. 20, sir.

1155
01:27:59,591 --> 01:28:02,326
Go out, then.
- No, sir. I'm saying... - Out!

1156
01:28:02,327 --> 01:28:03,794
Don't shout, sir.

1157
01:28:09,300 --> 01:28:11,718
Are you stopping your
banana pushcart for

1158
01:28:11,719 --> 01:28:14,135
your silly business?
- Let me move, sir.

1159
01:28:21,012 --> 01:28:26,350
Our anger is our enemy
& our patience is our friend.

1160
01:28:26,351 --> 01:28:29,153
I thought this on that day itself
seeing your anger.

1161
01:28:29,154 --> 01:28:30,989
As you would become
such a cheap businessman.

1162
01:28:30,990 --> 01:28:33,390
Shout louder. You won't
get any customer, then.

1163
01:28:33,391 --> 01:28:38,996
Banana! Dozen is for Rs. 25.

1164
01:28:38,997 --> 01:28:41,065
Dozen is for Rs. 25. Please come.

1165
01:28:41,066 --> 01:28:43,467
- Come, guys.
- Come, guys.

1166
01:28:43,468 --> 01:28:45,286
Sweet fruit! Tasty fruit!
- Very good, dad.

1167
01:28:45,287 --> 01:28:47,104
You'd shout like this only.

1168
01:28:47,105 --> 01:28:50,174
Not only this cart. You will sell
this too. Shout! - Shut up!

1169
01:28:50,175 --> 01:28:51,825
Hotness in a side &
hunger in another side.

1170
01:28:51,826 --> 01:28:53,474
Why didn't they come here yet?

1171
01:28:55,480 --> 01:28:56,980
Dad! They've come.

1172
01:28:56,981 --> 01:28:58,282
Shout well!

1173
01:28:58,283 --> 01:29:03,987
Banana! Come, guys.
Sweet & fresh bananas!

1174
01:29:03,988 --> 01:29:05,989
Crazy bananas.

1175
01:29:05,990 --> 01:29:08,492
You people take this today
& give me the money tomorrow.

1176
01:29:08,493 --> 01:29:12,529
Dozen is for Rs. 25. Come, guys.

1177
01:29:12,530 --> 01:29:16,398
I thought badly. Ln-law is too
talented in his business.

1178
01:29:17,402 --> 01:29:23,207
Come, guys. Dear! We are hungry.
Give us 2 bananas, please.

1179
01:29:23,208 --> 01:29:27,010
Go, man. We're dying here.
Why do you disturb us? Go.

1180
01:29:27,011 --> 01:29:30,314
Dozen is for Rs. 25. We are hungry.
Give us 2 bananas, dear.

1181
01:29:30,315 --> 01:29:32,616
Hey! No donation & nothing!
Leave away.

1182
01:29:32,617 --> 01:29:35,953
Dear! We are old people.
We are dying because of hunger.

1183
01:29:35,954 --> 01:29:39,056
Please give us 2 bananas.
You'll have goodness.

1184
01:29:39,057 --> 01:29:44,620
Hunger...? Here. Take it.

1185
01:29:51,569 --> 01:29:55,403
Why did you give your fruit to her?
- Her health is not good.

1186
01:29:59,010 --> 01:30:03,447
Come. Here! You both eat it.

1187
01:30:03,448 --> 01:30:04,642
Take it.

1188
01:30:05,550 --> 01:30:08,018
- Eat it.
- Enough, dear.

1189
01:30:08,019 --> 01:30:10,354
What's this, old man? Get up!

1190
01:30:10,355 --> 01:30:12,220
Krishna! Give me money.

1191
01:30:14,259 --> 01:30:17,227
Here. Have this money.

1192
01:30:17,228 --> 01:30:19,263
You take her to a hospital.

1193
01:30:19,264 --> 01:30:23,394
If you need any help...
Hey! Give me my address.

1194
01:30:24,602 --> 01:30:27,204
If you need any help,
come to this address.

1195
01:30:27,205 --> 01:30:28,605
Let me help you.

1196
01:30:28,606 --> 01:30:32,342
That god only had sent you
to satisfy our hunger.

1197
01:30:32,343 --> 01:30:35,712
Your hands should offer
others always like this.

1198
01:30:35,713 --> 01:30:38,546
That god should bless you well.

1199
01:30:43,354 --> 01:30:48,091
Did you see him? He didn't sell more.
But he's donations are more.

1200
01:30:48,092 --> 01:30:51,295
He gave him banana, money
& his visiting card too.

1201
01:30:51,296 --> 01:30:52,764
He will sell his cart too.

1202
01:30:52,765 --> 01:30:56,433
Can a banana vendor
have a visiting card?

1203
01:30:56,434 --> 01:31:01,505
I didn't see those things. - Then?
- I've seen the goodness in him.

1204
01:31:01,506 --> 01:31:04,304
My daughter is too lucky.

1205
01:31:09,447 --> 01:31:11,312
They've gone. Shall we go?

1206
01:31:13,117 --> 01:31:14,584
Let's go.

1207
01:31:28,199 --> 01:31:30,292
Why are you thinking something?

1208
01:31:31,402 --> 01:31:33,803
People say that our stomach
will feel our hunger.

1209
01:31:33,804 --> 01:31:36,203
But eyes have felt that today.

1210
01:31:37,175 --> 01:31:39,743
I didn't feel my hunger
properly after my birth.

1211
01:31:39,744 --> 01:31:43,236
But I've come to know
the pain of hunger today.

1212
01:31:46,084 --> 01:31:49,110
Instead of the happiness by improving

1213
01:31:56,527 --> 01:31:59,196
In the yearly income of
Welfare Group of industries...

1214
01:31:59,197 --> 01:32:02,299
I've decided to donate
- 30% of its profit.

1215
01:32:02,300 --> 01:32:05,602
We issue apartments
to all of our staffs.

1216
01:32:05,603 --> 01:32:08,071
Expenditures for their
children's education...

1217
01:32:08,072 --> 01:32:11,769
My company is going to take over
their family's monthly expenses totally.

1218
01:32:24,622 --> 01:32:29,293
Hey brother-in-law! Hello!

1219
01:32:29,294 --> 01:32:35,465
Why are you going by your
car wearing suit & boot?

1220
01:32:35,466 --> 01:32:36,634
You lost your properties
fully, didn't you?

1221
01:32:36,635 --> 01:32:38,403
I played the cards
game again last night.

1222
01:32:38,404 --> 01:32:40,170
I got the joker this time.

1223
01:32:40,171 --> 01:32:41,470
I've got back my properties fully.

1224
01:32:41,471 --> 01:32:42,640
You are great, brother-in-law.

1225
01:32:42,641 --> 01:32:45,009
You're looking like
Mayabazar cinema Ranga

1226
01:32:45,010 --> 01:32:47,377
Rao after getting
back your properties.

1227
01:32:47,378 --> 01:32:49,505
Let me come tomorrow
& get your blessings.

1228
01:32:53,418 --> 01:32:56,153
I asked you not to quarrel with
my brother for this only, right?

1229
01:32:56,154 --> 01:32:59,890
Not that. Quarrel! - Dad!
Is my marriage fixed with my uncle?

1230
01:32:59,891 --> 01:33:02,257
I'll fix it. How did I get you both?

1231
01:33:07,131 --> 01:33:11,500
Idiots! We've found them.

1232
01:33:11,903 --> 01:33:16,239
We have to know the capacity
of this house owner.

1233
01:33:16,240 --> 01:33:17,298
Yes, brother.

1234
01:33:17,775 --> 01:33:22,735
Leave it. We've got a good
daughter-in-law for these days suffers.

1235
01:33:23,648 --> 01:33:27,140
Somebody is there.
If we ask them, they will say us.

1236
01:33:28,820 --> 01:33:34,190
Come. I'll give Rs. 100. Come, man.

1237
01:33:36,861 --> 01:33:40,597
We need the information
about this house owner.

1238
01:33:40,598 --> 01:33:41,733
What information do you want?

1239
01:33:41,734 --> 01:33:44,463
We have to know the capacity
of this house owner.

1240
01:33:45,670 --> 01:33:47,570
I'll give you Rs. 100.

1241
01:33:51,376 --> 01:33:54,174
Hello! Police station!

1242
01:33:58,383 --> 01:34:01,852
Uncle! I've found that house,
where Naginidu is staying.

1243
01:34:01,853 --> 01:34:06,490
Tell me. - That house owner is
not an ordinary man, uncle.

1244
01:34:06,491 --> 01:34:07,392
What did he do, man?

1245
01:34:07,393 --> 01:34:13,764
Police station has become so alert as
soon as that house servant called them.

1246
01:34:13,765 --> 01:34:17,166
They've turned me into pieces, uncle.

1247
01:34:18,836 --> 01:34:24,708
You Prabhakar!
I've got that Naginidu's address.

1248
01:34:24,709 --> 01:34:29,408
They should not stamp
this boundary again.

1249
01:34:31,749 --> 01:34:33,784
Don't be hurry. I'll
give you one by one.

1250
01:34:33,785 --> 01:34:35,819
How much do you want?

1251
01:34:35,820 --> 01:34:39,923
Wait! It's too hot.
- Her business is too good, man.

1252
01:34:39,924 --> 01:34:43,424
Yes. - Oh! If my sister
continues her Bujji

1253
01:34:43,425 --> 01:34:46,924
business, your dad's
business will go down.

1254
01:34:48,299 --> 01:34:50,467
You man! How do my mom
know to prepare Bujjis?

1255
01:34:50,468 --> 01:34:52,601
Bujjis & those people are
also readymade. - Readymade...?

1256
01:34:52,602 --> 01:34:54,400
I gave Rs. 100 per head & sent there.

1257
01:35:01,579 --> 01:35:03,638
They are working hard for food.

1258
01:35:13,257 --> 01:35:15,559
Your friend has got
a good taste, uncle.

1259
01:35:15,560 --> 01:35:17,661
He's built his house so grandly!

1260
01:35:17,662 --> 01:35:19,663
He's suffered a lot, sir.

1261
01:35:19,664 --> 01:35:24,267
House is 6 years...
- Why are you standing lazy there?

1262
01:35:24,268 --> 01:35:26,759
- Go & mind your work.
- Sorry, sir.

1263
01:35:31,442 --> 01:35:33,643
You also do some works here.

1264
01:35:33,644 --> 01:35:36,545
If you sit freely, you won't
earn crores of properties.

1265
01:35:38,583 --> 01:35:42,619
He is looking so weak. But he tortures
everybody like a dinosaur, brother.

1266
01:35:42,620 --> 01:35:48,354
If it was Royala Seema, I'd have
broken his head & threw to our dogs.

1267
01:35:48,759 --> 01:35:52,629
Uncle! Do you want
to visit any tourist spot?

1268
01:35:52,630 --> 01:35:55,066
No, dear. - Brother!
Do you want to have any juice?

1269
01:35:55,067 --> 01:35:57,334
Get us some chilly Bujjis.

1270
01:35:57,335 --> 01:36:01,471
Mom! Split those Bujjis
& pour some lime juice into it.

1271
01:36:01,472 --> 01:36:04,007
Let me pour it, dear.

1272
01:36:04,008 --> 01:36:07,811
I was roaming by BMW car.
He asks me to prepare chilly Bujji.

1273
01:36:07,812 --> 01:36:11,815
He asks me to split it
& pour lime juice into it.

1274
01:36:11,816 --> 01:36:14,584
Okay. Where is this cook Geetha?

1275
01:36:14,585 --> 01:36:15,987
She's taking a shower bath.

1276
01:36:15,988 --> 01:36:17,984
This cooking assistant Lakshmi.

1277
01:36:17,985 --> 01:36:19,980
- See. She's sitting
having face pack there.

1278
01:36:22,527 --> 01:36:24,794
I'm dying by their build ups.

1279
01:36:24,795 --> 01:36:27,030
Okay. What flour
we have to use for Bujjis?

1280
01:36:27,031 --> 01:36:30,333
Wheat flour. - Is it?
- Hey! No! Rice flour, aunty.

1281
01:36:30,334 --> 01:36:32,969
Oh! Some flour!
Give me those chilies first.

1282
01:36:32,970 --> 01:36:36,106
What happened, aunty?
You're tensed it seems.

1283
01:36:36,107 --> 01:36:39,976
Nothing. Your dad asked
chilly Bujjis it seems. - Is it so?

1284
01:36:39,977 --> 01:36:41,410
Let me cut these chilies.

1285
01:36:41,411 --> 01:36:42,572
You mix the batter, aunty.

1286
01:36:45,049 --> 01:36:48,450
My dad likes green
chilly Bujjis very much.

1287
01:36:49,787 --> 01:36:53,557
Oh blood! What's this, dear?

1288
01:36:53,558 --> 01:36:54,525
Why were you not careful, dear?

1289
01:36:54,526 --> 01:36:57,694
Why didn't you work carefully?
- Blood! How did it take place?

1290
01:36:57,695 --> 01:36:59,822
It's a small wound only, brother.
- No problem, aunty.

1291
01:37:00,631 --> 01:37:03,498
Why do you say as a small wound?
She's got bleeding here.

1292
01:37:06,370 --> 01:37:09,464
Ma'am! I'm coming.

1293
01:37:15,947 --> 01:37:19,015
Ma'am! I'm coming.

1294
01:37:19,016 --> 01:37:22,452
- Hey Arvind! Where did you go?
- Sir!

1295
01:37:25,022 --> 01:37:29,993
Why did they run here? - Get us
the first aid box. Take her fast.

1296
01:37:29,994 --> 01:37:31,985
Ask them to come fast.

1297
01:37:33,898 --> 01:37:35,066
Hey! Come, men.

1298
01:37:35,067 --> 01:37:37,364
We've come, sir.

1299
01:37:46,177 --> 01:37:49,544
- Is it paining?
- No, aunty.

1300
01:37:53,417 --> 01:37:55,035
How did she get this cut?

1301
01:37:55,036 --> 01:37:56,653
- To prepare Bujjis...
- Stop preparing Bujjis.

1302
01:37:56,654 --> 01:37:58,589
Let's order that from
- 5 star hotel if needed.

1303
01:37:58,590 --> 01:38:01,157
Shut up, dad. What's our range
& how can we order 5 star hotel Bujjis?

1304
01:38:01,158 --> 01:38:04,658
We are poor people. Right?
- Why did these

1305
01:38:04,659 --> 01:38:08,158
millionaires run here
hearing your call?

1306
01:38:09,166 --> 01:38:14,399
Until you're our guests... We are your
servants even if we are millionaires.

1307
01:38:15,473 --> 01:38:18,141
Stop this Bujji matter
& all of you do your works.

1308
01:38:18,142 --> 01:38:21,009
- Come, man.
- Sorry, sir.

1309
01:38:23,881 --> 01:38:25,148
What happened?

1310
01:38:25,149 --> 01:38:30,644
My mother is no more. I've got an aunty
like my mother because of you.

1311
01:38:42,466 --> 01:38:47,037
What, brother? Got tears
looking your daughter's suffer...?

1312
01:38:47,038 --> 01:38:51,841
No, man. My eyes have got
practiced seeing bleedings...

1313
01:38:51,842 --> 01:38:54,245
My eyes could not bear seeing
their utmost affection.

1314
01:38:54,246 --> 01:39:00,206
My mom, who has come in between
these people, is a lucky fellow.

1315
01:39:04,855 --> 01:39:06,890
Come fast!

1316
01:39:06,891 --> 01:39:08,943
We have to act well & fix
her marriage definitely.

1317
01:39:08,944 --> 01:39:10,994
- Is my marriage fix with uncle?

1318
01:39:10,995 --> 01:39:12,860
I'll fix it, my dear baby.

1319
01:39:17,101 --> 01:39:24,101
Is this a dream or real?
This is the life.

1320
01:39:31,882 --> 01:39:35,382
Is this a dream or real?
This is the life.

1321
01:39:35,383 --> 01:39:38,882
- What happened again, uncle?

1322
01:39:39,256 --> 01:39:42,025
Poverty is playing 20- 20
match with my dad.

1323
01:39:42,026 --> 01:39:45,562
Last night... - Yes. You've played
the cards game last night.

1324
01:39:45,563 --> 01:39:48,798
You're saying that he joker
& you lost everything. Is that all?

1325
01:39:48,799 --> 01:39:52,802
Brother! Won't you stop playing cards
even if you fail for many times?

1326
01:39:52,803 --> 01:39:57,207
Not that. You've to say
as cards game. - Something, dad.

1327
01:39:57,208 --> 01:40:01,144
Is my marriage fixed with my uncle
or not? - You want that. Right?

1328
01:40:01,145 --> 01:40:03,146
That's all. Hey! Take her, man.

1329
01:40:03,147 --> 01:40:05,148
They will give you a banana daily.
Eat that.

1330
01:40:05,149 --> 01:40:09,586
Ln-law! We want to talk to you.

1331
01:40:09,587 --> 01:40:12,055
Who is he? Your cards partner...?

1332
01:40:12,056 --> 01:40:16,659
Not that, brother. We're going to
make our Krishna marry his daughter.

1333
01:40:16,660 --> 01:40:18,810
It's a poor alliance like us.

1334
01:40:18,811 --> 01:40:20,960
- What is he doing?
- Head master, uncle.

1335
01:40:23,934 --> 01:40:25,702
He's not like a head master.

1336
01:40:25,703 --> 01:40:27,136
He's looking like a rowdy,
who removes others heads.

1337
01:40:28,038 --> 01:40:31,207
He's not a normal man.
He's like a police dog.

1338
01:40:31,208 --> 01:40:33,610
Okay. You do this business
at least very well.

1339
01:40:33,611 --> 01:40:34,811
Live happily.

1340
01:40:34,812 --> 01:40:37,847
Come. Head master!
Do you know cards game?

1341
01:40:37,848 --> 01:40:40,784
- No.
- You don't learn to play it too.

1342
01:40:40,785 --> 01:40:42,353
Otherwise you will get
to push the cart like them.

1343
01:40:42,354 --> 01:40:45,220
My sister is drying in the hot sun.

1344
01:40:47,057 --> 01:40:48,757
Why are you standing here
itself until now?

1345
01:40:48,758 --> 01:40:50,661
If we stay here,
it will become a gambling club.

1346
01:40:50,662 --> 01:40:53,696
Come. - Is there nothing in between
my uncle & me? - It's there.

1347
01:40:53,697 --> 01:40:58,828
You both shout & sell bananas.
Go. Come, dear.

1348
01:41:00,204 --> 01:41:02,272
Don't play gambling. Let me beg you.

1349
01:41:02,273 --> 01:41:05,008
Ln-law! We thought about everything.

1350
01:41:05,009 --> 01:41:07,977
We like your alliance in all aspects.

1351
01:41:07,978 --> 01:41:11,014
Let's fix the Muhurtham on a good day.

1352
01:41:11,015 --> 01:41:12,573
Very happy, in-law.

1353
01:41:20,357 --> 01:41:21,758
Hey girl! Is that you?

1354
01:41:21,759 --> 01:41:24,727
If you know about my boss,
you'll get shocked. Do you know that?

1355
01:41:24,728 --> 01:41:27,263
If I hear your words, I'm very happy.

1356
01:41:27,264 --> 01:41:29,858
Let me meet your boss once
& leave after thanking him.

1357
01:41:47,284 --> 01:41:51,855
Greets! She'd told us about some schemes
to remove poverty here before. Right?

1358
01:41:51,856 --> 01:41:53,257
She's come to meet you, sir.

1359
01:41:53,258 --> 01:41:58,991
If you turn once... No, sir. She's come
to thank you. Just turn, sir.

1360
01:42:00,764 --> 01:42:02,129
Leave him. No problem.

1361
01:42:02,399 --> 01:42:05,702
He told me about your
social service, sir.

1362
01:42:05,703 --> 01:42:12,703
Very happy. People, who donate the
currency notes are great than gods.

1363
01:42:15,779 --> 01:42:16,803
Let me leave, sir.

1364
01:42:21,685 --> 01:42:23,887
- We've escaped.
- We're saved, sir.

1365
01:42:23,888 --> 01:42:26,880
- Let's leave out from here.
- Okay, sir.

1366
01:42:29,059 --> 01:42:31,060
Sorry, ma'am. I could not
show you my boss.

1367
01:42:31,061 --> 01:42:32,688
No problem, sir.

1368
01:42:41,872 --> 01:42:44,807
- That photo...
- My boss family.

1369
01:42:46,377 --> 01:42:50,074
You told that somebody helped
to poor people. - This family only.

1370
01:42:56,287 --> 01:42:58,186
What's there if I hadn't
introduced you my big boss?

1371
01:42:58,187 --> 01:42:59,890
My small boss has come.
Let me introduce him to you.

1372
01:42:59,891 --> 01:43:00,720
Come!

1373
01:43:22,913 --> 01:43:24,210
You keep this coat.

1374
01:43:36,827 --> 01:43:37,960
My name is poor Krishna, sir.

1375
01:43:37,961 --> 01:43:39,163
I'm working in a petrol bunk.

1376
01:43:39,164 --> 01:43:41,791
I've come wearing
a suit expecting a job here.

1377
01:43:42,800 --> 01:43:44,300
How can I give you a job, sir?

1378
01:43:44,301 --> 01:43:46,303
You're our prince.
- Prince is Mahesh Babu, isn't he?

1379
01:43:46,304 --> 01:43:48,430
You're our small boss.
- That also Mahesh Babu.

1380
01:43:50,441 --> 01:43:53,142
Not that, sir.
- Sir! Understand my position first.

1381
01:43:53,143 --> 01:43:55,012
Understand me, sir.
- Why do you blink your eyes, sir?

1382
01:43:55,013 --> 01:43:57,981
Understand me.
- Sir! I want this job definitely, sir.

1383
01:43:59,283 --> 01:44:01,410
Whatever may be the job, sir.
I'll do it.

1384
01:44:04,121 --> 01:44:07,390
Let me hold your feet
& all your body parts, sir.

1385
01:44:07,391 --> 01:44:09,293
Why do you hold me, sir?
- For my job, sir.

1386
01:44:09,294 --> 01:44:11,961
Don't deny me, sir.
- No need to act hereafter.

1387
01:44:11,962 --> 01:44:13,156
I've come to know everything.

1388
01:44:16,300 --> 01:44:17,867
She's seen your photo inside, sir.

1389
01:44:17,868 --> 01:44:20,837
Who told her everything?
- It's me only.

1390
01:44:20,838 --> 01:44:22,999
I'm the story, screenplay,
direction & everything.

1391
01:44:23,974 --> 01:44:25,908
Shouldn't I do direction, sir?

1392
01:44:29,179 --> 01:44:31,044
Your daughter-in-law is coming.
Position change.

1393
01:44:36,286 --> 01:44:39,922
Tell me. Did you finish that work?

1394
01:44:39,923 --> 01:44:41,557
I'm millionaire speaking.

1395
01:44:41,558 --> 01:44:42,855
Who is there?

1396
01:45:03,480 --> 01:45:04,538
What happened, dear?

1397
01:45:06,984 --> 01:45:09,509
You people are millionaires,
aren't you?

1398
01:45:13,557 --> 01:45:17,326
You people are acting like
servants in your house. Right?

1399
01:45:17,327 --> 01:45:23,099
Brother! We thought them as
a cheap family. They are a rich family.

1400
01:45:23,100 --> 01:45:26,135
No, man. They are a golden family.

1401
01:45:26,136 --> 01:45:30,173
Not that. - I've tortured you
people very much.

1402
01:45:30,174 --> 01:45:32,642
We liked you very much, dear.

1403
01:45:32,643 --> 01:45:35,945
We've acted like this to get you
as our daughter-in-law.

1404
01:45:35,946 --> 01:45:40,178
How can I get such a nice co-sister
even if I spend crores of money too?

1405
01:45:41,552 --> 01:45:44,987
I'm telling you, am I not?
It's not your fault, dear.

1406
01:45:44,988 --> 01:45:46,580
Tell her. Control yourself, dear.

1407
01:45:47,491 --> 01:45:50,119
Kishore! Business is very dull.
- Yes, uncle.

1408
01:45:51,028 --> 01:45:53,110
It's too hot. Business
was too dull today.

1409
01:45:53,111 --> 01:45:55,192
Here. I earned only Rs. 50 today.

1410
01:46:04,174 --> 01:46:07,577
What? Are you feeling as
I've earned only Rs. 50?

1411
01:46:07,578 --> 01:46:10,342
This is common in business.
Right, Kishore?

1412
01:46:12,382 --> 01:46:15,952
Forgive me, uncle. I've tortured
you people very much.

1413
01:46:15,953 --> 01:46:17,284
Get up!

1414
01:46:23,393 --> 01:46:28,097
Stop this marriage, uncle.
I'm not eligible for this family.

1415
01:46:28,098 --> 01:46:30,633
I got thousands of crores idle with me.

1416
01:46:30,634 --> 01:46:34,270
But good mind of serving
to living people, is there in you.

1417
01:46:34,271 --> 01:46:38,040
No, uncle. You don't know
about our family.

1418
01:46:38,041 --> 01:46:41,177
Our family members don't deserve
to stand in front of you too.

1419
01:46:41,178 --> 01:46:42,645
Education is great than money.

1420
01:46:45,482 --> 01:46:47,984
We'd go to school before
he comes to know the truth.

1421
01:46:47,985 --> 01:46:50,019
No. My dad...
- Sathya! Don't talk further.

1422
01:46:50,020 --> 01:46:52,454
You don't hurt anybody by your guilty
feeling. Everything is going on well.

1423
01:46:52,455 --> 01:46:54,358
- Not that, Krishna.
- Sathya! Please.

1424
01:46:54,359 --> 01:46:57,326
Believe me. - Why are you having
an useless meeting here?

1425
01:46:57,327 --> 01:46:59,328
Why don't you do some works here?

1426
01:46:59,329 --> 01:47:01,627
Hey fatty! I'm telling you only.

1427
01:47:03,233 --> 01:47:05,001
Are you beating a millionaire?

1428
01:47:05,002 --> 01:47:07,596
I won't play this character. You man!

1429
01:47:08,572 --> 01:47:09,873
You need not play
this character anymore.

1430
01:47:09,874 --> 01:47:12,542
Is it so? Am I your driver now?
Should I remove my dress now?

1431
01:47:12,543 --> 01:47:18,614
No need, idiot. Our Krishna & Sathya's
betrothal should be grand tomorrow.

1432
01:47:18,615 --> 01:47:20,082
- Okay, man.
- Hey!

1433
01:47:44,081 --> 01:47:46,184
You've come to own my beauty fully.
You've given me the signal.

1434
01:47:46,185 --> 01:47:48,418
You've come forward & tried to kiss me.

1435
01:47:48,419 --> 01:47:53,023
Your naughtiness is too much.

1436
01:47:53,024 --> 01:47:57,527
Your naughtiness is too much.
How is your health, man?

1437
01:47:57,528 --> 01:48:00,163
You've given me your beauty freely.

1438
01:48:00,164 --> 01:48:03,833
I'm very active because
of my youthfulness.

1439
01:48:03,834 --> 01:48:06,069
My health is very good, baby.

1440
01:48:06,070 --> 01:48:10,370
My health is very good, baby.

1441
01:48:43,007 --> 01:48:45,542
You've come like a thief here.

1442
01:48:45,543 --> 01:48:48,144
You're not stopping your
robbery hearing my words too.

1443
01:48:48,145 --> 01:48:52,582
You're coming near me & torturing me
to play with you romantically.

1444
01:48:52,583 --> 01:48:57,254
You're hurrying a lot to enjoy with me.
What can I tell you?

1445
01:48:57,255 --> 01:49:01,885
You're hurrying a lot to enjoy with me.
What can I tell you?

1446
01:49:06,097 --> 01:49:08,632
Hey! If I praise your beauty,
you are being so temper.

1447
01:49:08,633 --> 01:49:11,201
You're admiring my heart
by your plates daily.

1448
01:49:11,202 --> 01:49:13,403
You asked me to meet you
in the lemon tree farm.

1449
01:49:13,404 --> 01:49:16,006
If I come there,
you're refusing me and running.

1450
01:49:16,007 --> 01:49:20,543
Believe my words, dear.
I've taken birth for you only.

1451
01:49:20,544 --> 01:49:25,174
Believe my words, dear.
I've taken birth for you only.

1452
01:49:55,112 --> 01:49:58,138
That's it. Well done!

1453
01:50:04,955 --> 01:50:09,426
If I ask you to keep the flower
on my hair, you touch my hip.

1454
01:50:09,427 --> 01:50:11,695
You're not at all stopping your plays.

1455
01:50:11,696 --> 01:50:14,230
You're holding my hands toughly
without allowing me to move.

1456
01:50:14,231 --> 01:50:18,735
You're using me well
& you are making to feel for it.

1457
01:50:18,736 --> 01:50:23,537
You're using me well
& you are making to feel for it.

1458
01:50:28,245 --> 01:50:30,481
I've got a good name in my native.
I've

1459
01:50:30,482 --> 01:50:32,716
become a cheap man after
seeing your beauty.

1460
01:50:32,717 --> 01:50:37,520
If I see your charming beauty,
I'm coming forward to impress you.

1461
01:50:37,521 --> 01:50:42,158
Let me hold your hands, baby. Let's be
awakened throughout the night.

1462
01:50:42,159 --> 01:50:46,996
Let me hold your hands, baby. Let's be
awakened throughout the night.

1463
01:50:46,997 --> 01:50:49,333
You've come to own my beauty fully.
You've given me the signal.

1464
01:50:49,334 --> 01:50:51,668
You've come forward & tried to kiss me.

1465
01:50:51,669 --> 01:50:56,239
Your naughtiness is too much.
How is your health, man?

1466
01:50:56,240 --> 01:51:01,007
Your naughtiness is too much.
How is your health, man?

1467
01:51:30,274 --> 01:51:31,536
Murder them, guys.

1468
01:51:40,785 --> 01:51:43,117
What's this? Krishna!
- No, Krishna.

1469
01:51:47,558 --> 01:51:48,354
No, man.

1470
01:52:20,558 --> 01:52:23,823
- Mom!
- Aunty!

1471
01:52:45,149 --> 01:52:52,149
Who are they? - Ln-law! - I won't agree
a bride from such a rowdy family.

1472
01:52:54,859 --> 01:53:00,092
All of you leave out
before I ask you to go out.

1473
01:53:01,265 --> 01:53:08,265
We are leaving, uncle.
Forgive us for cheating you.

1474
01:53:14,678 --> 01:53:21,451
I don't deserve to hold your feet
& apologize to you also.

1475
01:53:21,452 --> 01:53:22,886
Forgive us, in-law.

1476
01:53:22,887 --> 01:53:24,821
Come, dear.

1477
01:53:32,363 --> 01:53:39,363
We are ghosts like how you said.
But our daughter is a gold, sir.

1478
01:53:44,441 --> 01:53:45,237
Gold!

1479
01:54:20,678 --> 01:54:27,584
This sickle is my enemy, which
spoiled my peace for all these days.

1480
01:54:28,619 --> 01:54:33,856
I wanted to revenge my enemies
by chopping their body. But...

1481
01:54:33,857 --> 01:54:38,385
I could not find that this sickle itself
would spoil my daughter's life.

1482
01:54:40,898 --> 01:54:43,733
I've killed many people.

1483
01:54:43,734 --> 01:54:47,470
Many people offered their souls for me.

1484
01:54:47,471 --> 01:54:51,601
Let me pray those families
apologizing to them.

1485
01:54:55,713 --> 01:54:59,849
Let me give my properties to their
family, who died because of me.

1486
01:54:59,850 --> 01:55:04,913
Let me leave this sickle
from today onwards.

1487
01:55:24,041 --> 01:55:29,345
I'm a normal person now. If anybody
has an enmity on me now too...

1488
01:55:29,346 --> 01:55:33,442
I'm ready to keep my soul
also in their feet.

1489
01:55:49,867 --> 01:55:51,994
Sathya! Dear Sathya!

1490
01:55:53,971 --> 01:55:58,408
Where is she? - Dad has sent our
Sathya's family from our house.

1491
01:55:58,409 --> 01:56:04,714
What did she do? If he sends them
angrily, what were you doing?

1492
01:56:04,715 --> 01:56:07,946
We were watching him
like dolls, ma'am.

1493
01:56:15,059 --> 01:56:16,994
You at least would have
questioned your father.

1494
01:56:16,995 --> 01:56:19,792
I didn't know what to ask my dad, mom.

1495
01:56:20,364 --> 01:56:24,100
He will be there in A/c always.
He stood in the hotness for me.

1496
01:56:24,101 --> 01:56:25,466
He lived in the hut.

1497
01:56:29,640 --> 01:56:33,543
He left his life & he's got
into the involvement.

1498
01:56:33,544 --> 01:56:35,878
To make my lies true...

1499
01:56:35,879 --> 01:56:37,938
He acted like a servant
in his own house.

1500
01:56:39,950 --> 01:56:44,546
I've tortured you all for my selfishness
to get succeeded in my love.

1501
01:56:45,556 --> 01:56:48,057
You may forgive me now too. But...

1502
01:56:48,058 --> 01:56:51,550
I don't have a stamina
to bear your mercy.

1503
01:56:54,064 --> 01:56:58,668
You people sacrificed your
happiness for my love until now.

1504
01:56:58,669 --> 01:57:02,799
I've planned to leave Sathya
for your happiness now.

1505
01:57:16,687 --> 01:57:17,984
Start the car.

1506
01:57:28,732 --> 01:57:30,700
Brother! Look there!

1507
01:57:31,802 --> 01:57:33,360
Ln-law! Is that you?

1508
01:57:35,606 --> 01:57:37,173
Can we come inside?

1509
01:57:37,174 --> 01:57:41,838
Can anybody refuse such
a great happiness? Come, in-law!

1510
01:57:46,850 --> 01:57:48,374
See, who has come.

1511
01:57:56,527 --> 01:58:01,726
Ln-law! Sathya should become
our family's daughter-in-law.

1512
01:58:03,500 --> 01:58:05,067
Without fail, in-law.

1513
01:58:05,068 --> 01:58:08,765
But you both should not
become our relatives.

1514
01:58:15,212 --> 01:58:18,712
Very happy, in-law.
You've given a place for

1515
01:58:18,713 --> 01:58:22,212
my daughter in your
temple like family.

1516
01:58:22,619 --> 01:58:26,077
Even if people like me don't
get a place in your family...

1517
01:58:27,491 --> 01:58:31,794
No problem. Not only coming to your
house for my daughter's happiness.

1518
01:58:31,795 --> 01:58:35,959
I won't pass my death message
also to your family.

1519
01:58:36,834 --> 01:58:37,994
Brother!

1520
01:58:40,604 --> 01:58:44,096
Sathya! Shall we go out?

1521
01:58:46,076 --> 01:58:47,907
You go, dear.

1522
01:58:52,816 --> 01:58:58,521
I'm very happy for your arrival
here to take me, uncle.

1523
01:58:58,522 --> 01:59:01,821
To what extent Krishna loves you!
I also love my dad like him.

1524
01:59:03,026 --> 01:59:07,053
My dad has sacrificed his enmity
& rowdism for me.

1525
01:59:08,098 --> 01:59:12,802
If I come leaving him alone
for my love now...

1526
01:59:12,803 --> 01:59:16,830
Mine will not be a love.
It will become a selfishness.

1527
01:59:20,677 --> 01:59:26,115
I don't have selfishness.
I can't come along with you.

1528
01:59:26,116 --> 01:59:28,949
Forgive me, please.

1529
01:59:42,566 --> 01:59:45,067
I had cut their relationship
because of my anger on them.

1530
01:59:45,068 --> 01:59:46,703
I like Sathya. That's not the reason.

1531
01:59:46,704 --> 01:59:49,839
I refused them fearing as
Venkatapa would murder you...

1532
01:59:49,840 --> 01:59:51,808
& Sathya by his enmity on Naginidu.

1533
01:59:51,809 --> 01:59:54,043
Venkatapa only has
brought this problem, uncle.

1534
01:59:54,044 --> 01:59:55,705
If we murder him,
our problem will be solved.

1535
01:59:56,747 --> 02:00:00,183
We'd not murder Venkatapa.
His evil mind only.

1536
02:00:01,585 --> 02:00:04,820
You useless man.
Who made you a lawyer, man?

1537
02:00:04,821 --> 02:00:11,821
You people are useless. You can't bring
out my son from an attempt murder case.

1538
02:00:12,562 --> 02:00:13,824
What a lawyer you are!

1539
02:00:15,933 --> 02:00:19,433
My son should come out to kill that

1540
02:00:19,434 --> 02:00:22,933
Naginidu even if he
has given up rowdism.

1541
02:00:22,940 --> 02:00:23,998
Leave away!

1542
02:00:29,880 --> 02:00:33,333
Greets, sir. I'm Sri Krishna.
Your fan.

1543
02:00:33,334 --> 02:00:36,786
- You call up to any
famous actor & not to me.

1544
02:00:36,787 --> 02:00:39,822
My name is Venkatapa, Kurnool.

1545
02:00:39,823 --> 02:00:42,058
Correct, sir. You're my favorite hero.

1546
02:00:42,059 --> 02:00:45,695
When I was roaming in Kurnool without
having money to go to my native...

1547
02:00:45,696 --> 02:00:47,254
You only gave me Rs. 30
& helped me, sir.

1548
02:00:48,198 --> 02:00:51,233
Did I give you Rs. 30?
When did I give you, man?

1549
02:00:51,234 --> 02:00:54,937
Yes, sir. I've gone with that
Rs. 30 like our Chiranjeevi sir.

1550
02:00:54,938 --> 02:00:57,668
I've earned hundred crores
like Shivaji Rajini sir.

1551
02:00:59,343 --> 02:01:01,243
Have you earned hundred crores?

1552
02:01:01,244 --> 02:01:03,612
What do you say now?

1553
02:01:03,613 --> 02:01:04,913
Are you going to give me your money?

1554
02:01:04,914 --> 02:01:07,250
If you are not ashamed to ask me,
I feel ashamed to give you, sir.

1555
02:01:07,251 --> 02:01:12,210
So let me do social service spending
hundred crores on your name, sir.

1556
02:01:13,323 --> 02:01:15,742
He's my fan. He is going
to do social service

1557
02:01:15,743 --> 02:01:18,160
spending 100 crores
on my name it seems.

1558
02:01:18,161 --> 02:01:20,162
He may be a mental, uncle.

1559
02:01:20,163 --> 02:01:23,733
You, your father
& your grandpa are mental.

1560
02:01:23,734 --> 02:01:25,134
He is my fan, man.

1561
02:01:25,135 --> 02:01:28,004
That Venkatapa is
a dangerous person & a devil.

1562
02:01:28,005 --> 02:01:29,339
If you say that he's got changed,
we won't believe that.

1563
02:01:29,340 --> 02:01:36,340
Yes. - You'd believe it. Our Venkatapa
also changed as a golden man.

1564
02:01:37,247 --> 02:01:40,983
He's planned to live with an ambition
to do social service always.

1565
02:01:40,984 --> 02:01:44,420
That's why, he has sent lakhs of rupees
for your food. Here is the cash.

1566
02:01:44,421 --> 02:01:46,922
1 lakh for rice...?
- Yes.

1567
02:01:46,923 --> 02:01:49,075
If he gives 1 lakh for
rice, how much he'll

1568
02:01:49,076 --> 02:01:51,227
pay for your provision items?
Think of it.

1569
02:01:51,228 --> 02:01:52,855
Give us that rice money first.

1570
02:01:54,031 --> 02:02:01,031
Take it. Greet Venkatapa.
- Venkatapa! Live long!

1571
02:02:02,973 --> 02:02:06,342
Nobody will be unhealthy
in this village hereafter.

1572
02:02:06,343 --> 02:02:08,777
Treatment is free in
this Venkatapa hospital.

1573
02:02:10,013 --> 02:02:14,279
Venkatapa water supply. Venkatapa has
solved this village's water problem.

1574
02:02:18,088 --> 02:02:19,739
What's this, sir?

1575
02:02:19,740 --> 02:02:21,390
- It's a social service
center of Venkatapa.

1576
02:02:21,391 --> 02:02:25,127
Brother! Our whole village is
praising you a lot.

1577
02:02:25,128 --> 02:02:28,731
Is it so? - Venkatapa hospital.
Venkatapa's provision store.

1578
02:02:28,732 --> 02:02:31,367
Venkatapa's orphanage.
Venkatapa's 109.

1579
02:02:31,368 --> 02:02:33,703
Venkatapa's water supply.
Venkatapa's free electricity.

1580
02:02:33,704 --> 02:02:36,238
Didn't he build the Venkatapa toilet?
- He's built that too.

1581
02:02:36,239 --> 02:02:39,975
Brother! You've become a god to our
people because of this appreciation.

1582
02:02:39,976 --> 02:02:40,944
Yes, brother.

1583
02:02:40,945 --> 02:02:43,179
Uncle! Our life is over.
- Why, man?

1584
02:02:43,180 --> 02:02:44,943
People are building your
temple in our village.

1585
02:02:46,416 --> 02:02:49,180
Are they building my temple?

1586
02:02:54,291 --> 02:02:57,960
Greets, sir. - Why are
you guys wishing me?

1587
02:02:57,961 --> 02:03:00,463
Our master only told us.
- What did they tell you?

1588
02:03:00,464 --> 02:03:06,869
Parents, ancestors
& Venkatapa are our gods.

1589
02:03:06,870 --> 02:03:08,929
He's told you correctly.
Follow his words.

1590
02:03:09,940 --> 02:03:12,342
I've got a son, brother.
We've kept your name only to him.

1591
02:03:12,343 --> 02:03:14,761
My name...? Why? - Not only this child.
They've

1592
02:03:14,762 --> 02:03:17,179
changed all the children's names here.

1593
02:03:17,180 --> 02:03:21,048
You bless my son
to live long years, brother.

1594
02:03:30,460 --> 02:03:37,460
Why do you cry like a child, uncle?
- I've murdered many people by my hands.

1595
02:03:37,834 --> 02:03:40,462
I've never had blessed anybody
to live for 100 years, man.

1596
02:03:41,404 --> 02:03:47,309
Whatever it is.
Living like a human, is very tough.

1597
02:03:49,146 --> 02:03:52,482
Sir! Sit down! - Why, priest?
- People want

1598
02:03:52,483 --> 02:03:55,818
to anoint you by milk
for your service.

1599
02:03:55,819 --> 02:03:58,420
Anointment of milk for me...?

1600
02:03:58,421 --> 02:04:03,154
Our country is the pure country.
It'd live long.

1601
02:04:04,461 --> 02:04:09,023
Our country is a holy country.
Praise it!

1602
02:04:10,066 --> 02:04:17,066
This person has gone up today. He's the
support of everybody all the time.

1603
02:04:21,211 --> 02:04:28,211
Why should they anoint me by milk?
- You're our god. - Yes, brother.

1604
02:04:29,252 --> 02:04:32,521
You're our Badrachalam!
- You're our Annavaram!

1605
02:04:32,522 --> 02:04:34,422
You're our Ponavaram!

1606
02:04:42,098 --> 02:04:47,469
Why do you pour less amount
of milk? Pour more milk.

1607
02:04:47,470 --> 02:04:51,270
I'd get drenched properly.

1608
02:04:52,108 --> 02:04:54,477
I've got tears while seeing
this milk anointment.

1609
02:04:54,478 --> 02:04:56,845
Why are they showing a love on me?

1610
02:04:56,846 --> 02:05:00,907
Venkatapa is not a human being.
- Then what? - God!

1611
02:05:03,620 --> 02:05:09,158
Om Namo Venkatapa!
Live long! Oh! Atom bomb!

1612
02:05:09,159 --> 02:05:14,630
He's the image of factionist!
He's a don!

1613
02:05:14,631 --> 02:05:18,829
He's the one, who throws
different types of bombs.

1614
02:05:21,438 --> 02:05:28,037
This Kurnool man is equal
to Lord Shiva too.

1615
02:05:30,347 --> 02:05:37,347
He's got wisdom to serve the people.

1616
02:05:38,955 --> 02:05:45,127
Why should we need other gods?
You're our god, man.

1617
02:05:45,128 --> 02:05:48,628
He's the Xerox copy
of Lord Venkateswara!

1618
02:05:48,629 --> 02:05:52,128
Come & praise him, man.

1619
02:05:54,237 --> 02:06:00,376
Venkatapa! Live long.
He's serving the people. Enjoy it!

1620
02:06:00,377 --> 02:06:05,481
His killing hands have changed
as serving hands.

1621
02:06:05,482 --> 02:06:09,919
We are eating Pulav by your favour.

1622
02:06:12,589 --> 02:06:19,361
This Sun has given us
cell phone freely.

1623
02:06:19,362 --> 02:06:25,164
He's become a statue in our family
by improving our financial status.

1624
02:06:28,238 --> 02:06:35,144
You're a brave man.
You've given us our needs.

1625
02:06:35,145 --> 02:06:42,145
You give us your properties, king.

1626
02:06:43,720 --> 02:06:48,190
This lion like hero has done well.

1627
02:06:48,191 --> 02:06:52,194
He's the lion, who has
started doing goodness.

1628
02:06:52,195 --> 02:06:56,231
He's become great than
donor Krishna Devarayar.

1629
02:06:56,232 --> 02:07:00,069
He's the lion, who has
given us the free current.

1630
02:07:00,070 --> 02:07:07,070
He's become a hero,
whom everybody praises.

1631
02:07:08,178 --> 02:07:12,014
You're the donor & brave man, brother.

1632
02:07:12,015 --> 02:07:16,251
What's the difference in between you
& broadminded people?

1633
02:07:16,252 --> 02:07:20,122
A heart has started beating
in this iron man.

1634
02:07:20,123 --> 02:07:23,659
He's become a human by
forgiving everybody.

1635
02:07:23,660 --> 02:07:27,429
He was factionist yesterday.
He's a Buddhist now.

1636
02:07:27,430 --> 02:07:31,066
He was like Narakasura.
He's changed as a graceful man now.

1637
02:07:31,067 --> 02:07:34,670
This ten heads Ravana
has changed as Lord Rama.

1638
02:07:34,671 --> 02:07:38,240
He's become our god throwing
away his killing sickle.

1639
02:07:38,241 --> 02:07:42,277
Oh man! You're our god!

1640
02:07:42,278 --> 02:07:45,611
I've got a doubt.
There is a flower in your ears.

1641
02:07:51,488 --> 02:07:56,792
His hatred has got changed.

1642
02:07:56,793 --> 02:08:00,593
Why don't you end your enmity?

1643
02:08:02,165 --> 02:08:09,165
If you both join your killing
hands together, that's good.

1644
02:08:12,475 --> 02:08:18,080
You both throw away your sickles.

1645
02:08:18,081 --> 02:08:22,317
You both become friends.

1646
02:08:22,318 --> 02:08:28,457
In this violent
& terrific Royala Seema...!

1647
02:08:28,458 --> 02:08:31,655
We've cleaned this Royala Seema.

1648
02:08:33,496 --> 02:08:37,398
It's become succeeded, guys.

1649
02:08:44,274 --> 02:08:49,143
Let's celebrate if these

1650
02:08:58,354 --> 02:09:02,724
if you both are joined together,
we will celebrate it daily.

1651
02:09:02,725 --> 02:09:05,660
Our problems will go off forever.

1652
02:09:10,667 --> 02:09:14,136
Brother! Your dad & Naginidu
have joined together.

1653
02:09:14,137 --> 02:09:15,764
There's no any factionist
in our village it seems.

1654
02:09:16,706 --> 02:09:19,470
- My dad! My mom!
- Greets!

1655
02:09:26,850 --> 02:09:28,408
Greets, uncle.

1656
02:09:43,600 --> 02:09:46,262
Don't go. Don't...!

1657
02:10:09,292 --> 02:10:12,327
Why do you stop me, dad?
Let me murder him.

1658
02:10:12,328 --> 02:10:15,464
Whom do you murder, man?

1659
02:10:15,465 --> 02:10:18,333
Who gave us the right
of killing a person?

1660
02:10:18,334 --> 02:10:20,202
They've mesmerized you, dad.

1661
02:10:20,203 --> 02:10:23,739
Yes. They've changed me
a human by mesmerizing me.

1662
02:10:23,740 --> 02:10:28,243
Are you killing him, whose mom
has brought you out from jail...

1663
02:10:28,244 --> 02:10:30,303
after when you hurt his mom?

1664
02:10:32,315 --> 02:10:35,284
Can you murder Nagini,

1665
02:10:35,285 --> 02:10:39,381
who is ready to live bravely instead
of living like a coward by rowdism?

1666
02:10:41,858 --> 02:10:45,928
If you don't change, that's
my fault for bringing up you.

1667
02:10:45,929 --> 02:10:48,830
Murder me by your sickle.
- No, dad.

1668
02:10:48,831 --> 02:10:50,832
- No.
- Let me commit suicide myself.

1669
02:10:50,833 --> 02:10:54,503
Leave me, dad.
- Let me kill myself.

1670
02:10:54,504 --> 02:10:57,239
You leave the sickle.
- Leave me, dad.

1671
02:10:57,240 --> 02:10:58,434
Throw away that.

1672
02:11:03,479 --> 02:11:05,344
Throw away that.

1673
02:11:19,495 --> 02:11:20,655
Well done!

1674
02:11:25,234 --> 02:11:28,734
A factionist was suppose
to be an obstacle

1675
02:11:28,735 --> 02:11:32,234
for their love. Let me join them now.

1676
02:11:33,610 --> 02:11:36,245
Let me prove that factionists
won't do only murders.

1677
02:11:36,246 --> 02:11:38,880
They will do social service also.

1678
02:11:38,881 --> 02:11:42,442
Let me wish you all.

1679
02:11:51,461 --> 02:11:55,631
Did your brother make some other girl
as his daughter-in-law refusing me?

1680
02:11:55,632 --> 02:11:58,767
Let me fight with him. What should
we do these bombs, brother?

1681
02:11:58,768 --> 02:12:02,636
Why do you have bombs in hands?
Throw away them.

1682
02:12:07,276 --> 02:12:09,811
Dad! Bangaru uncle!
- Why did he come here?

1683
02:12:09,812 --> 02:12:14,349
Brother! - I told that I'd not come
to this Nellore for this only.

1684
02:12:14,350 --> 02:12:19,354
It's not Nellore. Kurnool, idiot. - Dad!
Is there nothing in between me & uncle?

1685
02:12:19,355 --> 02:12:24,418
It's there. - Come. - You've
spoiled my dreams, son-in-law.

1686
02:12:30,967 --> 02:12:33,386
You've got me a saree.
You've sighted me.

1687
02:12:33,387 --> 02:12:35,804
You've come forward
& tried to kiss me.

1688
02:12:35,805 --> 02:12:42,805
Why do you tease me?
How is your health?

1689
02:12:44,881 --> 02:12:51,881
I'm there in an enjoying young age.
My health is very good, baby.

1690
02:13:30,426 --> 02:13:32,561
You've come here like a thief.

1691
02:13:32,562 --> 02:13:35,397
You're not stopping your robbery
even after hearing my words.

1692
02:13:35,398 --> 02:13:39,768
You've entered in me & made me
to dance along with you.

1693
02:13:39,769 --> 02:13:44,506
You've hurried a lot & you've tortured
me a lot by your charming beauty.

1694
02:13:44,507 --> 02:13:49,069
You've hurried a lot & you've tortured
me a lot by your charming beauty.

1695
02:13:52,381 --> 02:13:54,984
You're looking too
cute & you're admiring

1696
02:13:54,985 --> 02:13:57,586
my heart by your hair style daily.

1697
02:13:57,587 --> 02:14:02,057
You call me to lemon tree farm.
If I come there, you show your temper.

1698
02:14:02,058 --> 02:14:09,058
Believe my words, dear.
I've taken birth for you only.

1699
02:14:09,083 --> 02:14:13,083
