1
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:14,720
Halal Designs.

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,400
The women there, took advantage...

3
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:20,160
of my client's fragile
psychological state.

4
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,240
That cannibal?

5
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:22,920
I saw it on the news.

6
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,520
Call your media guy. - 'Cannibal
Shehnaz didn't turn her house'

7
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,560
'into a slaughterhouse
all by herself.'

8
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,760
Churails!
- Down with them!

9
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,240
Churails!
- Down with them!

10
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,520
Churails!
- Down with them!

11
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,720
Ma'am, you didn't even think
that this could...

12
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,840
sabotage your husband's
political career?

13
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,720
Sara, what the hell is wrong with
you? - Jamil, I've to go.

14
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,680
Do you understand?
- At least think of the kids!

15
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,120
Tell me how I can help you.

16
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,560
Arrest me.

17
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,600
But don't humiliate the others.

18
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,200
We need to rectify the mistake.

19
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,520
Churails!
- Down with them!

20
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,040
Churails!
- Down with them!

21
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,560
Churails!
- Down with them!

22
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,920
Bring the shutter down.

23
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,200
And hire a security company.

24
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,240
Babli!

25
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,320
My daughter.

26
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,880
I need to find her.

27
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,800
I was meant to be there.

28
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,760
How will we get through this?

29
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,640
There's no news of Sheila.
Please find her.

30
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,840
One, two, three, four...

31
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,520
Five, six, seven, eight.

32
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,040
Cut. Cut!

33
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,080
Where is the stylist?

34
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,520
I keep saying that her navel
should be visible!

35
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,040
Why does she keep pulling
her pants up?

36
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,800
Navel! This is not a navel!

37
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:14,920
"I am a witch."

38
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,760
"My eyes cast black magic."

39
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:25,280
"I wander in the darkness of night."

40
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:31,240
"My aura will instil fear in you."

41
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:34,120
"Witch.
- It's my reincarnation."

42
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,040
"Witch.
- It's the end of your story."

43
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,600
'CHURAILS'

44
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,600
6. BEAUTY...

45
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:03,960
'Do you know the strangest
thing about our public?'

46
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,880
'Even their hate is fickle.'

47
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,120
'In just a few weeks,'

48
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,920
'we had become old news.'

49
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,640
Yeah, hello!

50
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,320
Hey, you're coming, right?

51
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,720
Yeah.

52
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,760
Listen...

53
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,960
It wasn't your fault, okay?

54
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,760
Yeah, I'll see you.
- Alright.

55
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,280
Jeez!

56
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,680
Let them in.

57
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,000
Are you alright?

58
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,880
Jiya,
showing up here again and again...

59
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,800
They fired me from the agency.
- Why?

60
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,520
I was asking everyone about Sheila.

61
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,680
It's been over two months.

62
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,440
What if something bad has
happened to my sister?

63
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,160
How long were you in
the hospital for?

64
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,440
An entire week.
- A week?

65
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,720
It was completely burnt.

66
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,360
Boss came to visit?

67
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,760
Tell me...

68
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,920
How did you manage without
Jugnu for a week?

69
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,240
Did you eat something, Dilbar?

70
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,640
Yes, I'll eat.

71
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,600
Did you find out?

72
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,520
Nothing showing up for 'Fauzia Ali'?

73
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,400
No ID number, no address.

74
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,720
Try 'Fauzia Karim Ali'.

75
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,920
Okay.

76
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,760
For now, keep this between us.

77
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,120
Zubaida?

78
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,040
Okay.

79
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,920
It feels so good.
We are together and happy.

80
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,840
But look at her.

81
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,080
She hasn't said a word
since she's come back.

82
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,960
I think she's still in shock.
- Poor thing.

83
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,080
Your voice is worse today.

84
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,760
What do you do?
- I haven't done anything!

85
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,040
Did you eat something?

86
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,720
Shall I get you something?

87
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,040
Get me some juice.

88
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,960
What are you doing here?

89
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,440
Come. Let's go outside.

90
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,120
Fun place, right?

91
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,640
Come out.

92
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,040
This is also a lot of fun.

93
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,800
Come. Leave this.

94
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,840
I can't do this.

95
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,960
Can't do it.

96
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,240
Suddenly, everything inside me...

97
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,120
has come to a standstill.

98
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,840
It's not happening.

99
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,160
Leave it then.

100
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,120
Go.

101
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,800
You've taken after your father,
after all.

102
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,720
Yeah, so what?

103
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,280
We don't know...

104
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:55,600
how to drag out these meaningless
relationships.

105
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,040
I can't do it anymore.

106
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,680
Okay.

107
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,120
Then go.

108
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,640
What did Myra do?
She ended up going with him!

109
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,280
No!
- Didn't even look back! Believe me!

110
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,840
Oh my god, you guys! Stories!

111
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,600
So shall we go?
- Yeah, you guys go!

112
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,200
So where did Zeeshan go?
- He never met her again!

113
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:40,440
About fucking time!

114
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,800
Oh! Are you alright?
- Yeah.

115
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,120
What are they doing here?

116
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,120
Hi!

117
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,280
Hi.

118
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,080
Oh! Please.

119
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,960
I can't believe this.

120
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,320
That poor girl has been knocking
at your door for over a month...

121
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,760
and you...
- Our Sheila! Ours!

122
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,960
Why didn't you tell us earlier?
- I went to the police station.

123
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,440
A missing person report
was already filed.

124
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,680
They're looking into it.
- Looking into it.

125
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:31,160
We have to find her, our way.

126
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,080
There is no 'our way', dammit!

127
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,760
All of you were right, I was wrong.

128
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,720
We shouldn't have reopened the shop.

129
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,960
We should've hired security.
We became...

130
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,480
I became very impatient
and impulsive.

131
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,120
Just forget about what
we used to be.

132
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,240
You really know how
to betray your own.

133
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,760
What?
- Oh, is this what we are doing!

134
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,600
This is what you want?
- What did you just say?

135
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,800
Stop! Stop!
- What did she mean?

136
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,320
Sara! Enough!

137
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,400
Sa...
- Wait.

138
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,400
I can't do this.
- Just wait a second.

139
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,520
The scene is such that...

140
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:33,480
We were too used to
'Men Will Suffer.'

141
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:40,160
So in your absence,
we made an impulsive decision.

142
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,240
What decision?

143
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,520
So, what do you think?

144
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,400
You have no idea how many...

145
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,760
circumcision parties I've organised,
just to fund this.

146
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,040
And wait till you see upstairs.

147
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,960
It's brilliant.

148
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,160
All of you have lost your mind.

149
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,760
Our shop was burnt down.

150
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,440
Babli just about survived. No.

151
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,960
No way.

152
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,680
Babli just about survived...

153
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,960
and after surviving,
she did nothing.

154
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,520
You can say 'no way,
no way' as much as you want...

155
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:28,080
but our house has collapsed.
We must build it back again.

156
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,640
So round two began at your house?

157
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,440
Lime green...

158
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,080
Or fuchsia?

159
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,080
I've asked you a question, madam.

160
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,600
I think, fuchsia.

161
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,600
"What is it?"

162
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,080
"What is this?"

163
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,960
"What is this?"

164
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:47,360
"What is this?"

165
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:50,720
"I have woken up."

166
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,920
"I have woken up."

167
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,600
"I have woken up."

168
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,120
"I have woken up."

169
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:10,920
"Now we'll create a ruckus."

170
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,240
"Now we'll create a ruckus."

171
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,840
"Now we'll create a ruckus."

172
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:22,160
"It's my turn."

173
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:27,240
"What is this?"

174
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,240
"What is this?"

175
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,520
"What is this?"

176
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,440
"Be ready!"

177
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,920
Did we get anything
out of her family?

178
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,960
They've lied in the past too.

179
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,320
According to Rida,
Sheila was very happy.

180
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,880
She used to send money home.

181
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:52,280
I spoke with some people
in the industry.

182
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,400
Sheila was about to be a star.

183
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,240
Sheila was working
with Juice Talent.

184
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,960
Juice? KK?

185
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,920
Why are you standing here?
Go and serve!

186
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,880
I agree.

187
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,800
Nothing beats the taste of freshly
hunted meat. - Yeah?

188
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:18,360
The two of you didn't join
the entire season.

189
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,800
We caught this gorgeous,
gorgeous deer on the last day.

190
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,120
So tender!

191
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,120
It's the agency, buddy.

192
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,200
It doesn't even give me
a chance to breathe.

193
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:31,080
There's so much content being
made now. - Excuse me.

194
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,200
Jugnu!

195
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,960
Hey!
- Thank you.

196
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:39,560
Fabulous! - Oh,
come on, look at this lovely garden.

197
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,160
It made my job very easy.

198
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,680
How do you find time for this?

199
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:45,360
You just have to be passionate
about things. Believe in it.

200
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,560
Gardening in that way is like...

201
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,560
It's like politics.

202
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,600
How are things with Jackson?

203
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:55,320
Good, good, yeah, yeah, good.
- Yeah?

204
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:58,080
That's good. Just a second.
- Yeah.

205
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,720
Oh God!

206
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,000
Hi, uncle!

207
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,600
How've you been?
- Good.

208
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:11,240
And what's this retirement
buzz I'm hearing?

209
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:14,040
Well,
it took me 30 years to realise...

210
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,120
you cannot teach idiots anything...

211
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,360
let alone history.

212
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,120
I am focused on writing my book now.

213
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:24,120
'Gender, Power and Colonialism.'

214
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,080
They'll probably...

215
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,600
put a 'fatwa' on me for
my radical views.

216
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:34,240
But hey,
one must live one's truths, right?

217
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,160
I mean, it's not as if...

218
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,520
you listened to us about...
- Just one second.

219
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,720
I already see a difference...

220
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,480
the confidence, the discipline.

221
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,800
I mean, you can...

222
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,520
What happened to her?

223
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,360
I don't know.
You were telling me about Adeel.

224
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,320
Yes. Look...

225
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,920
I know he is still young.

226
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,040
But KK and I really swear by the
British education system.

227
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,920
Call me old fashioned.

228
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,480
But the stature of an all boys
boarding school is incomparable.

229
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:12,080
Instilling brotherhood, passion.

230
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,080
They all turn out to be go-getters.

231
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,760
I get that. But...

232
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:19,760
I can't send Salaar and
Sameer alone like that.

233
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,520
Mothers have to be strong, darling.

234
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,480
I think you should go and check
on her. - I should, right?

235
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,680
Go, go!

236
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,960
I'm going to join the boys
and their hunting talk.

237
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,160
God, stalker much?

238
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,760
How're you feeling?

239
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,840
Why is it called morning sickness
when it goes on all day long?

240
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,040
It'll get better soon.

241
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,120
Did you tell Jackson?

242
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,520
I gotta get back to work.

243
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,120
You should tell him.

244
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,440
Tell him!

245
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,200
It's all about achieving
geometrical perfection.

246
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,960
We've got to get the
cheekbones popping.

247
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:28,120
You've outdone yourself.
- Yes!

248
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,160
It's two sessions.

249
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:33,360
And the best thing,
it's completely non-invasive.

250
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:36,400
I mean,
it's not even surgery, so to speak.

251
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,520
Ladies.
- Hi.

252
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,040
This man, best in town.

253
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,880
Thank you, buddy.
You're much too kind.

254
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,720
Shahnawaz...

255
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,920
Okay, come inside.

256
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,480
My bag's in the lounge.
- Okay!

257
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,800
Buddy. Ladies.
- Oh, sure.

258
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,080
Maria's friends?
- Yeah.

259
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,880
The models.
- Yeah.

260
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,760
I can get you some interesting work.

261
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,360
Who represents you?

262
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,520
Everything looks great.

263
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,320
Atiq's wedding will be even better.

264
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,400
I'm sure.

265
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,920
Shit.

266
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,080
Sorry.
- Are you okay? Are you fine?

267
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,840
Wait, I... Are you okay?

268
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:24,080
You came drunk?
- Drunk?

269
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,320
No.

270
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,640
I just...
- Yeah.

271
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,880
What are you doing?

272
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,360
What is this?

273
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,960
Sorry, I'm late.

274
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,080
I've ordered a steak for you.

275
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,640
Rare, okay?

276
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,680
Yup, rare is good.

277
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:17,120
I'm trying not to eat meat
these days, so...

278
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,800
Ma'am. Anything else, ma'am?

279
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,360
No, no, nothing else.

280
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,920
You go.
- Okay, thank you.

281
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,480
Hmm.

282
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:28,880
The steak here is fantastic.

283
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,440
So?

284
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,520
About the fire.

285
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,720
Did you find out anything?
Any update?

286
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,600
Police is looking into it,
but what will they find out?

287
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:43,040
You fingered the public.

288
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:46,360
They turned into maniacs,
as simple as that.

289
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,880
In the dark of the night...

290
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,600
with no surveillance cameras
on that street.

291
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,560
Where does one go looking for them?

292
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,480
It's a dead end.

293
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,560
Bon Appetit.

294
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,560
By the way...

295
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,960
Tanvir had a stroke, a few days ago.

296
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,080
Well, minor, but...

297
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:54,400
He's been weak ever since.

298
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:59,240
And prison has never
been kind to anyone.

299
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,880
Specially those coming from money.

300
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,960
You broke my brother's heart.

301
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,040
What...

302
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,040
Are you serious?

303
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,840
I broke his heart?

304
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:22,200
He made a career out of looting
everyone, and...

305
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:25,640
I broke his heart?
- You married a fucking negro!

306
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,720
You brought us disgrace.

307
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,160
To create a buzz,
you could've married someone white.

308
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,680
Like I did.

309
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:37,480
People would've gossiped for a few
days, then forgotten about it.

310
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,280
But no! You'd to marry a black guy.

311
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,960
It was only after that
bloody Jackson...

312
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,040
that things went downhill
for your father.

313
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,680
He lost his edge, his sharpness...

314
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,760
ended up in a fucking prison!

315
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:55,120
Don't you walk away from me, Jugnu!

316
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,400
Hey!

317
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,240
Turn the fan here!

318
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,520
Too busy cooling his own pubes!

319
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,960
You like it, yeah?

320
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,360
Me too.

321
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,800
Those moves.

322
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:33,160
"Look at me."

323
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:36,760
"Come an take me in your arms."

324
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,160
"Come and quench my thirst."

325
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:44,440
"Come and me me tonight."

326
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,440
This one's hot too, but...

327
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,240
This one's hotter?

328
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:58,320
This one, Shakeela Siddiqui...

329
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,920
Is lost.

330
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,760
Lost as in?

331
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,320
As in...

332
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,360
She's disappeared. Missing.

333
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,240
It's been two months.

334
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:11,360
Her dad filed a missing persons
report, but no luck.

335
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,280
Can you help...

336
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,480
Boss?

337
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,880
You're asking so...

338
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,080
I can.

339
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,880
You, sit... No?

340
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,000
Jiya...

341
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,680
These are the only clothes
Sheila had?

342
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,080
What do you mean?

343
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,080
The entire cupboard is full.

344
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:34,080
All her clothes were here.

345
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,120
I saw them.

346
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,080
Suitcase.

347
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,720
Sheila had a red suitcase.

348
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,080
It's not here anymore.

349
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:59,360
She came back and took her stuff?

350
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,960
Or someone else did.

351
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,080
How did it go with Ifti?

352
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,680
Don't ask.

353
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,080
I'll be outside.

354
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:22,240
If I catch Juice's Wi-Fi,
maybe I can access their system.

355
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,720
Okay.

356
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,160
"Youth!"

357
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,920
"Oh My God!"

358
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:44,080
"I am a naughty girl!"

359
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,760
"Naughty naughty girl."

360
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,320
"Naughty naughty girl."

361
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:57,160
What can I say?
It's the nature of our business.

362
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,840
Girls come, girls go.

363
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:02,320
Even if under contract,
you can't really force them to stay.

364
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:06,200
But this girl has vanished.
As in, missing.

365
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,800
She must be having a
fling with someone.

366
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,240
They all do.

367
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,920
She must have run away with him.

368
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,960
I really wouldn't worry about it.

369
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:16,560
And, why did you fire
Jiya from the agency?

370
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,320
Because she was asking questions
about Sheila?

371
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,960
Oh, is that what she's saying?

372
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,960
Look, if you fail to perform...

373
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,480
you don't book jobs...

374
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,560
why should I keep you on my roster?

375
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,760
Beauty aside...

376
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,680
In order to survive
in this industry...

377
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,000
you need guts.

378
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,720
Not all girls can hack it.

379
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,320
I accessed the archive files
on both Sheila and Jiya...

380
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,840
from the Juice database.

381
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,120
Look at the agreed amount
for this commercial.

382
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,200
And the talent agency's commission.

383
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:48,840
It was in Juice's interest
to keep Sheila around.

384
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:54,520
What is this product? Jalwa?

385
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:05,280
"Jalwa showed its splendour"

386
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:08,480
"and in no time I was"

387
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:11,480
"light, light!"

388
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:15,080
"My skin so white, white."

389
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,960
"Jalwa worked its magic"

390
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:23,160
"and now even he says"

391
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:26,320
"bright, bright!"

392
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:30,080
"My skin so white, white."

393
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:36,360
In the '90s, Jalwa fairness cream
and powder were famous.

394
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,920
Then fell off the grid.

395
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:41,360
Now they're rebranding Jalwa,
and launching it again.

396
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,480
A new advert was to be
shot for the relaunch.

397
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,920
Sheila was hired for it.

398
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,800
It would be a part of Sherry's
skincare and makeup line.

399
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:50,160
Sherry, from Sherry's Salon.

400
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:54,320
"I am the queen of lightening."

401
00:28:55,520 --> 00:29:00,240
"I am the queen of lightening."

402
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:03,960
"They call me 'hawa hawai'!"

403
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:07,160
"Hawa hawai!"

404
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,160
She was pretty.
Had a fair complexion.

405
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:12,080
And I've always been keen on
giving new talent a chance.

406
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,880
Enough with the same,
overused actresses!

407
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,360
Stars. What stars?

408
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,760
Why would Sheila leave
this opportunity?

409
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,240
That is the problem.

410
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:25,240
These girls don't understand
commitment.

411
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:29,840
Last minute, I'd to find a
replacement for the TVC.

412
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,120
What base are you using, dear?

413
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,080
NC 45.

414
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,760
Apply 35.
Why are you making her darker?

415
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,760
And apply it on the neck too...

416
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,520
so the shade matches.

417
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,080
So, Sherry...

418
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,720
why was Jalwa off market
for so long?

419
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,160
Competition, darling.

420
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,480
Competition.

421
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,880
My husband... Well, he's dead now...

422
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:54,520
but he ran the business
until he was alive.

423
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:57,240
New products kept coming
into the market.

424
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,640
And we stared losing out.

425
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,720
Eventually,
I'd to sell the company's...

426
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,600
majority shares to save
it from bankruptcy.

427
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,600
Wow.

428
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,600
Remember,
there was an actress named Tabinda?

429
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,760
She also used to be
the face of Jalwa.

430
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,280
Yes.
- Am I right?

431
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,600
Tabinda.

432
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,920
She was a star in the true sense.

433
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,160
Dream girl of that era.

434
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,120
Life is strange, isn't it?

435
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:29,120
With time,
everything comes to an end.

436
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,120
Tabinda Rafi.

437
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,080
Old school Lollywood.
Maybe red-light district, not sure.

438
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:43,760
In 1997, she became the face
of Jalwa for a few years.

439
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:47,480
And by 2012,
she retired and moved to Islamabad.

440
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,480
I dug out her address.

441
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,520
One of us should visit her.

442
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,520
Hmm. Maybe.

443
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,720
But what about this?

444
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,920
Resham and Munni are already on it.

445
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,240
Mister, don't lose them.

446
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:07,200
Yes mister, please drive faster.

447
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,440
Go closer.
- But not too close!

448
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,160
What if we get caught?

449
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:32,600
Fate keeps bringing us
back to this hotel!

450
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,960
All we do in this job is smell sex.

451
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,640
She's here!

452
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,120
Wait on the side. I'm coming.

453
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,960
I will sell her stuff!

454
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,840
So then where did it all go?

455
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,400
How do I know?

456
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,520
She left me and ran away, the bitch!

457
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,640
Said she loved me.

458
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:38,320
You're still using, aren't you?

459
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:53,960
When there's nothing to hide...
- Fucking nothing to hide!

460
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,800
Are you that dumb?

461
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,120
They'll throw me in prison.

462
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,120
You... You promise me.

463
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,640
Promise me that you won't
tell anyone, anything.

464
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,080
I won't.

465
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,320
Don't blow the money on meth!

466
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,920
So, Jiya was lying?

467
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,840
Madam, please...

468
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,680
Co-operate. It's for your own good.

469
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:53,640
Eat!
- Eat this?

470
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,120
Yeah.

471
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,880
I think,
I shouldn't have brought you here.

472
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,720
Then why did you?
- What do you mean, why did I?

473
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,520
Why did you bring me here?

474
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:22,360
I thought you'd like it. - Boss,
I've been trying for so long...

475
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,360
to have dinner with
you just one time.

476
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,880
And you brought me here.

477
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,960
Listen,
we can even go to a food stall...

478
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,720
as long as it's clean.

479
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,600
Clean can go fuck itself.

480
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,800
What the fuck is this idiot doing?

481
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,320
Dilbar, you need... Stop!

482
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:46,160
Stop! S...

483
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,800
I'd to literally walk through
fire to get this chance.

484
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:00,800
And it took you no time
to show me my place.

485
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,080
Hey!
- What the...

486
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:08,680
Fuck!

487
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:28,600
All of these people
are fucking nuts.

488
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,000
Hello. What?

489
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:36,800
I'm coming.

490
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:57,120
Everyone isn't designed to rule,
or to be in a position of power.

491
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:00,320
Some operate at their best
capacity when subjugated.

492
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,720
That's a fact of life.

493
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,800
Is that what's in your book?

494
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,520
Well, part of it, yes.

495
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:12,400
I go into a lot more
detail about how...

496
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,840
the lack of stratification
leads to disorder.

497
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,080
Where did you go to school, Ifti?

498
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,560
Ah!

499
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,880
I was briefly at Grammar...

500
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:27,040
then a boarding school in Kent,
and then Oxford.

501
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,680
What about you, Jackson?

502
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:35,080
Where did you study before
you went to New York?

503
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:36,760
Me?

504
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,080
I went to a state school in Croydon.

505
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,240
Anyway.

506
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:46,280
So, what I was saying, was that...

507
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:49,080
History shows us that...

508
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:53,440
as devastating as certain
situations were, or...

509
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:55,640
appeared to be at that time...

510
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:57,520
they served a bigger purpose.

511
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,480
Of streamlining and...

512
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:02,240
Placing communities where
they belonged.

513
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:03,920
You talking race?

514
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,360
I think,
what Ifti is trying to say is...

515
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,720
Look...

516
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:10,840
I'm not talking about you lot,
but for us...

517
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:14,560
Say, take the Raj for instance.

518
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,640
People like painting it in a...

519
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:21,320
Terrible light,
as some dark period in our history.

520
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,200
But truth be told, we...

521
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,600
Needed them to fix us up.

522
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,560
After all,
there's something to be said...

523
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:32,080
about the natural hierarchy
of colour.

524
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,760
Whoa!
- Hey, hey, hey!

525
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,960
Jackson, back off. Hey!
- Please, Jackson.

526
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,200
Jackson!

527
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,240
What's wrong with you, man?
Back off. - Back off, Jackson.

528
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,120
Back off, Jackson!

529
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,880
This is what you married! This!

530
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:01,600
I told you it's in their blood,
in their DNA.

531
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:02,880
They can't help themselves!

532
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,400
Go home, Jackson!

533
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,360
A garden party.

534
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,200
A fucking garden party.

535
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,400
A rabbit. A peacock.

536
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,360
A mineral water pool in a country
where people die...

537
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,080
because of lack of drinking water.

538
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,600
Who the fuck are you people?

539
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,200
Please, go home. Just don't...

540
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,840
Don't say anything else, okay?

541
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,640
You know, I love you, right?

542
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:25,720
You're my man. You're my beautiful
- Your beautiful black man?

543
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,400
Your rebellion?

544
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,960
One life you got.

545
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:34,960
One fucking life.

546
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,400
And this is what you
guys do with it.

547
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:46,520
Alright, Ifti? Sure?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

548
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,920
Come, have a seat.

549
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,680
Just get some water.

550
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:03,080
What was going on with you?

551
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,840
Nothing.

552
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,880
I think, I...

553
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,440
Needed time, I guess.

554
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:14,600
I wasn't getting over
what had happened.

555
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:19,400
I needed to be with my kids...

556
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,000
my husband.

557
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:28,080
No way we can claim insurance
on the arson.

558
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,920
It's going to be a complete
write-off, as expected.

559
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:33,800
I'm sorry.

560
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,240
You're alright. You're safe.

561
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,120
That's all that matters.

562
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,080
KK called.

563
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:46,240
He was saying something
about you visiting...

564
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,880
digging around for someone?

565
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:49,960
I thought, we stopped all that.

566
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,120
It's stopped.

567
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,960
But this is personal.

568
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,400
This girl used to work for me.

569
00:40:57,240 --> 00:41:00,720
I promise you, it's nothing like
before, I'm being very careful.

570
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:03,680
In fact,
Jugnu is handling everything, so...

571
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,960
There's nothing for
you to worry about.

572
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:12,960
I trust you.

573
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,720
You were right.

574
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:28,400
It's not the universe,
but people who fuck us up.

575
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,320
That too, those we consider our own.

576
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:33,920
Talk to Babli, apologise to her.

577
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:37,960
There's one good thing in your life,
you'll lose that too.

578
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:42,280
Don't let go what is yours, dear.

579
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,440
Are you done? Leave.

580
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:50,840
Go.

581
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:11,680
Motherfucker!
- Open the fucking door!

582
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,600
Nobody moves!
- Get back!

583
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,120
Stay still,
or I'll blow your brains out!

584
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:19,800
Step back!

585
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:23,480
Shit!

586
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:25,800
Fuck! Fuck!

587
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:35,480
Get off me!
- You little bitch!

588
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:40,040
We were gonna get married.

589
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,320
I was to leave all this. Just...

590
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:47,240
I needed a little more time.

591
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:53,280
When Sheila called me
for the last time...

592
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:56,800
She was crying.

593
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:00,160
She said she can't do all this.

594
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:02,760
Can't do what?

595
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,280
This fake, superficial work.

596
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:10,680
She was offered this face cream ad.

597
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:15,200
Sheila didn't want to do it.

598
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:17,720
Was that it?

599
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:19,960
Then why did you hide?

600
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:22,760
I got scared!

601
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:27,240
Police torture for no reason.
Force a confession...

602
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:32,800
He's spewing lies, the junkie.

603
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:34,720
Take him, boss.

604
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,120
What is all this?

605
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:39,120
Boss, I'm telling the truth.

606
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:42,080
Boss, I'm telling the truth!
- Nothing. Come, you fucker!

607
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:46,080
I don't know where she is, sir!

608
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:48,840
I don't know where she is!

609
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:50,040
Sir!
- Speak!

610
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:51,120
Motherfucker!

611
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:53,200
You gonna lie to me,
you sisterfucker! - Sir!

612
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:55,600
You liar!
- I don't know. Sir!

613
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:59,120
Tell me.
- I don't know, sir!

614
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:01,840
Sir, I don't know!

615
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:03,240
I really don't know.

616
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:07,120
Get him down.

617
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,040
He's my brother.

618
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:18,480
He's got a good heart.

619
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:20,040
He's decent.

620
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:23,520
But he just got addicted.

621
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:26,600
How long have you been escorting?

622
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:30,080
She was going to be a star...

623
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,520
And you were going nowhere.

624
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:34,120
Junkie number one.

625
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,080
It must have hurt, right?

626
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:42,080
To see her on TV...

627
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,320
On the internet.

628
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:46,760
Oh lover boy.

629
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:50,400
"Oh lover boy. Oh..."

630
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:53,120
Strangers getting horny
over your girl.

631
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:55,960
You couldn't tolerate it, right?

632
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:57,240
Sir, that's not it.

633
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:04,840
Look at me.

634
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:10,760
Everyone thinks you're an asshole.

635
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:14,880
You're a demon in everyone's eyes.

636
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:21,080
But what I see...

637
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:24,240
Is a helpless...

638
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:27,640
Innocent child.

639
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:31,120
Yes, sir.

640
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:35,080
You... You can see, right?

641
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:37,480
You understand, right?

642
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:40,840
A child...

643
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:43,040
That is tired...

644
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:46,680
Of running...

645
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:49,440
And now he is...

646
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:52,960
desperate to tell me
the whole truth.

647
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:55,800
Yeah?

648
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:02,880
It's our bit on the side.

649
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:05,080
Money is good.

650
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:08,680
But it's not what you think.

651
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:11,080
I don't have sex with them.

652
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:13,640
I just give company.

653
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:15,960
We have dinner together.

654
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:19,080
The men open up to us.

655
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:23,120
The way they can't with their wives.

656
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:27,160
But I never attended those parties.

657
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:29,760
It's my fault, sir.

658
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:34,360
I used to ask her to
go to those parties.

659
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:35,880
What parties?

660
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:40,040
If I'd just stopped her,
she would be here today.

661
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:44,000
Tell me.

662
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:46,840
What parties?

663
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:50,400
I'm here for you.

664
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:57,800
Actresses and models
from the industry...

665
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:00,120
The new, upcoming ones...

666
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:02,880
They go there.

667
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:06,840
They entertain the men.

668
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,040
The agency organises it all, sir.

669
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:16,600
The girls are made to sign an
agreement, so they keep quiet.

670
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:22,160
I've heard there's a different
ambience there.

671
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:25,680
At a secluded beach hut...

672
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:27,720
Late at night...

673
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:30,960
Wealthy, older men come there.

674
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:34,280
I was never invited, but...

675
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,640
Sheila used to attend regularly.

676
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,560
I know what you must be thinking.

677
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:47,200
What kind of man does this?

678
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:51,160
But there was money, sir.

679
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:53,560
I was helpless. What was I to do?

680
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:59,720
I kept sending her,
and she kept going.

681
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:11,920
Sir, I made a mistake.
A huge mistake!

682
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:13,320
Green or red?

683
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:15,480
Sir?

684
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:22,080
I'm gonna burst your ass
open with chillies.

685
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:25,040
But you can decide, red or green?

686
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:27,720
Sir, no. Sir!
- Sir, forgive me.

687
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:28,720
It'll burn, sir!

688
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:31,440
Sir, forgive me. - Grind it well
and shove it all up his ass.

689
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:32,800
Sir, forgive me. I know nothing.

690
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:34,400
I didn't do anything.
My ass will be on fire!

691
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:35,800
Oh, nothing will happen.
Nothing at all.

692
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:37,800
Yes, it'll burn, you cocksucker!
- Forgive me, sir!

693
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:40,120
I don't know anything!
- Motherfucker!

694
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:14,960
There's something you should know.

695
00:49:57,840 --> 00:49:58,840
'Hello?'

696
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:04,240
'Hello?'

697
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:07,440
Hey, Jackson.
- 'Hey.'

698
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:09,080
It's uh...

699
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:15,120
I uh...

700
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:18,080
Sorry, is this a bad time?

701
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:19,560
'Um, no.'

702
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:21,800
'Is everything alright?'

703
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:25,160
Yeah, everything is fine. Just...

704
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:32,320
Are you...

705
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:35,640
Do you have guests over?
- 'No'.

706
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:36,880
'That's Elijah.'

707
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:38,480
'My son.'

708
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:44,640
'Hello?'

709
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:48,320
'Hello?'

710
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:49,760
'Hello?'

711
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:52,040
'Jugnu!'

712
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:56,360
'Hello?'

713
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:06,920
What is it?

714
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:13,440
Jackson, I...

715
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:17,280
I am...

716
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:28,000
Nothing. Just uh...

717
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:31,600
It was a good ride, wasn't it?

718
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:51,200
One good thing came
out of the stroke.

719
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:52,720
My daughter came to visit.

720
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:57,440
Jackson has a son.

721
00:51:58,760 --> 00:51:59,920
That's good.

722
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:05,840
We decided this together, Jugnu.

723
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:08,160
No, you decided.

724
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:10,600
I just went along with it.

725
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:12,840
Because you were my father.

726
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:15,240
How could you make a wrong
decision for me?

727
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:18,040
My love, I tried...

728
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:20,360
to protect you.

729
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:23,960
If you and Jackson had a baby...

730
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:26,080
Then he wouldn't look
as 'white' as us?

731
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:32,040
I didn't even tell him.

732
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:34,120
There was no need to tell him.

733
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:36,520
Your life was here.

734
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:38,120
His was in New York.

735
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:42,560
He may have stayed if he knew.

736
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:46,960
And you wanted to cage him
through fatherhood.

737
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:49,160
And you would've flown
away yourself.

738
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:52,320
Just like your mother.

739
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:13,760
You have to find Sheila.

740
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:28,600
"When you look for me, and
call for me; I will call out."

741
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:31,640
'In this city of 15 million...'

742
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:35,240
"These
self proclaimed protectors..."

743
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:37,960
'There are 15 million monsters...'

744
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:44,120
"When you look for me, and
call for me; I will call out."

745
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:47,480
"When they tell you..."

746
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:50,360
'Who will find 15 million ways...'

747
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:53,160
'To tear you up,'

748
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:55,080
'cut you open...'

749
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:57,960
"When you look for me, and
call for me..."

750
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:01,240
'And swallow you whole,
in the blink of an eye.'

751
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:09,720
"He is the keeper of the night!"

752
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:15,040
"This can't be true."

753
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:19,000
"Let's read on..."

754
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:23,160
"Look for it."

755
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:26,760
"I can't locate you."

756
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:33,280
"When god questions me,
I will dance my way through."

757
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:41,520
"She has become the keeper..."

758
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:44,080
I found Mehak.

759
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:46,480
She lives in a girls' hostel.

760
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:48,480
She's using her birth name.

761
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:58,320
"I am a seeker."

762
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:07,480
"My father is looking for me..."

763
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:15,600
"My mother loves me."

764
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:23,360
"I will placate my own."

765
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:30,760
"They have become the keepers."

766
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:36,320
"She is in trouble."

767
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:38,760
"She did not draw boundaries."

768
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:44,720
"She is in trouble."

769
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:47,520
"She is in trouble."

770
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:55,560
"When you look for me,
I will call out."

771
00:55:56,280 --> 00:56:02,960
"When the keeper of
the night speaks..."

772
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:10,960
"Too many troubles..."

773
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:20,200
"Forget your problems."

774
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:27,480
"This should be buried in
the night."

775
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:34,960
"Get rid of your problems."

776
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:43,880
"She is in trouble."

777
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:52,160
"She is in trouble."

778
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:58,480
"When you look for me,
I'll call out..."

779
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:01,080
'And inside the belly of a beast,'

780
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:03,320
'what beauty will you find?'

781
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:10,520
"The keepers of the night."

782
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:15,960
"When you look for me,
I'll call out."

783
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:21,640
"They are keepers of the night."

784
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:25,640
"Keepers of the night."

785
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:36,680
'You'll have to come! Come with me!'

786
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:39,520
'Leave me, you bad wolf!
Where are you taking me? Help!'

787
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:41,880
'I'm saying come with me!
- Somebody, save me!'
