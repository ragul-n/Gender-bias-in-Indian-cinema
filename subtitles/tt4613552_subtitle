00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:01,960
RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

2
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:06,060
THE STORIES AND CHARACTERS DEPICTED
HERE WERE INSPIRED BY OUR HISTORY

3
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,530
NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED DURING
THE FILMING OF THIS PRODUCTION.

4
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,500
For the men who died...

5
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:19,780
God is the Greatest.

6
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,500
God is the Greatest.

7
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:39,020
God is the Greatest.

8
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,280
Peace be upon you and God’s blessings.

9
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:53,320
Peace be upon you and God’s blessings.

10
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:04,320
Our brothers ask for your
blessing one last time.

11
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,860
-Do you bless them?
-We bless them!

12
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,100
-Do you bless them?
-We bless them!

13
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,160
-Do you bless them?
-We bless them!

14
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:15,230
If God permits,
they will forgive us as well.

15
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:19,930
For our Prophet Muhammad’s intercession...

16
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,600
...for our brothers’ soul...

17
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:25,300
...for our tribe’s unity and abundance...

18
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:26,930
For God’s mercy...

19
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,930
...recite Al Fatiha prayer.

20
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:11,360
My Beys...

21
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,830
My heroes...

22
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,200
Wise men of my tribe...

23
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,130
...I know what is in your hearts...

24
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:23,860
...we have the right for revenge
from this lowlife.

25
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:30,500
He should not get away with the blood he
shed and the curses he got for cruelty.

26
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,960
But...

27
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,300
...executing this lowlife is not for us.

28
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:53,100
His sentence should be given
by Sultan Aladdin.

29
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:59,530
Suleyman Shah...

30
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,800
...how many mothers are mourning now.

31
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,660
They think about their loved ones
who died at the hands of Kara Toygar.

32
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:09,040
What you are saying makes us even suffer more.

33
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:13,920
You are so unaware! When did you see
our Bey make our tribe bow down in shame?

34
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:17,500
Our Bey knows what is best for all of us.

35
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:20,800
My Beys...

36
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:24,830
...we have the right to blood,
that is a fact but...

37
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,530
...practicing eye for an eye
is not an honor for us.

38
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:33,200
The sentence for collaborating with
the Crusaders and betraying the state...

39
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,200
...should be given by Sultan Aladdin.

40
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:38,460
Does anyone have an objection?

41
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:53,400
Commander Sari Boru shall take Kara Toygar
to Konya and deliver him to the sultan.

42
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:59,830
The lowlife dog will understand
before his last breath that...

43
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:03,100
...treachery would be punished
sooner or later.

44
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,930
Commander, you are a lucky man.

45
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:32,500
You will see this pig drowning
in his own blood.

46
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,830
We have to set on the road
to Aleppo in two days.

47
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,100
Are the preparations completed?

48
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:05,160
We have packed everything, Bey. Only
the dismantling of the carpet workshop...

49
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:07,030
...and the tents are left.

50
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,020
The herd has also set off, my Bey.

51
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:12,020
I sent some trusted Alps
with the herders as well.

52
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:28,520
Then the job of taking the agreement to
El Aziz and building the stables...

53
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:31,200
...and sheep pens shall be...

54
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,960
...yours, Gundogdu.

55
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,130
Father, with your permission...

56
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:07,000
-Father?
-Suleyman!

57
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:09,230
Suleyman!

58
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,120
-My Bey?
-Father?

59
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:21,100
I seek refuge in God from Satan, the Accursed one.

60
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,940
In the name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful.

61
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,140
Ya Sin

62
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:29,460
By the wise Qur’an

63
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:32,680
Truly you are of those sent

64
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:35,920
On a straight path

65
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,840
A revelation of the Mighty, the Merciful

66
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:45,420
That you might warn a folk whose fathers
were not warned, so they are heedless.

67
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:51,740
Indeed, the word was proved true against the greater part of them, for they believe not.

68
00:10:51,740 --> 00:11:00,900
Surely, we have put on their necks yokes reaching unto the chins, so they are made stiff-necked.

69
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:06,740
And We have set a bar before them
and a bar behind them

70
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:11,860
and (thus) have covered them so that they see not.

71
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,600
Now it is up to you.

72
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:12,860
You will go to Sultan Aladdin
and tell him everything.

73
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,400
You will tell him that Kayis...

74
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:21,300
...kidnapped the traitor Shahzadas
you were taking to Konya...

75
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:28,200
...then used their names to get support
from other Turkmen tribes for an uprising.

76
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:34,230
They want to rise up
and overthrow Sultan Aladdin.

77
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:40,360
I could not acknowledge such a thing,
so I set off again...

78
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:44,330
...to take the rebellious
Shahzadas to Konya.

79
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:50,300
They ambushed me. Killed all my soldiers.

80
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:56,260
My most trusted commander, Sari Boru.

81
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:03,500
They cut his throat, right in front of me.

82
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:08,960
You will take an army from
Sultan Aladdin and bring them here.

83
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:12,530
Kayis will understand
why they call you the Fire of Wrath.

84
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:17,830
Then you will return back to
Konya and become the right hand...

85
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:21,030
...of the sultan you have just saved.

86
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:39,000
I did what I could do.

87
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:43,160
Unfortunately his fever is not going down.

88
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:49,530
They only thing we can do now is pray.

89
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,360
Our Bey...

90
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:11,400
...would like us to do our chores
and jobs whatever happens.

91
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,530
We all know our jobs and chores.

92
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,600
When he opens his eyes...

93
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:23,300
...he should see that all is done.

94
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:29,300
We have a long road
ahead of us to Aleppo...

95
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,400
...but none of us shall give up.

96
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,200
ALEPPO

97
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,160
Welcome back, my Sheikh.

98
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,900
Thank you, my Pir's grandson.

99
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:36,030
May God have his mercy over us.

100
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,460
Your heavenly grandfather had said...

101
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:42,960
...“each bird flies with its own kind.

102
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,600
Eagles with eagles. Crows with crows.”

103
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,200
Aleppo has become very crowded.

104
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:05,130
Eagles are at one gate
and crows on the other.

105
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,890
They all have different wishes.

106
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:12,060
Some are after their food, not caring
about whether it is lawful or not...

107
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:18,540
...others are after a post. They don't
care whether God has given consent or not.

108
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:23,860
And when those plot against you, God (also) plots.

109
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:31,460
-Without doubt, God is the best of plotters!
-Dear God. Of course.

110
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:55,000
Good news for you, Selcan Hatun.

111
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,430
Your intuition was right.

112
00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:03,130
From now on you will not only live for
your husband, but for your son as well.

113
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:28,240
A long journey awaits Ertugrul and us.

114
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:32,660
We are impatient to leave...

115
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:36,740
...but this will be the hardest
journey I will be on.

116
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:38,100
I know.

117
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:42,380
Be my confidant, my comrade, Sultan.

118
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:52,920
-If only things were different.
-If only.

119
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:57,130
I heard that...

120
00:18:57,430 --> 00:18:59,530
...Suleyman Shah is not well.

121
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:05,800
They say he is sleeping and waiting for death!

122
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:11,560
They say he waits for
his time in his deathbed.

123
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:18,230
We piled more problems over his troubles.
We became a big burden for him.

124
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:21,260
May God help him.

125
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,130
Amen.

126
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,230
Suleyman Shah said that...

127
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:44,200
...Gundogdu Bey will be going to Aleppo.
She will take you there, Halime.

128
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,000
Gundogdu Bey?

129
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:58,200
Do not forget to dismantle this.

130
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:06,260
Tie them well.
We have a long road ahead of us.

131
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,200
So you came, Kurdoglu.

132
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:29,900
When you hear the things I am going
to say, you will be surprised.

133
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:34,560
The identities of our valuable guests
who brought...

134
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:38,600
...nothing but dark clouds over our tribe
are revealed.

135
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:48,600
Numan who claimed to be a trader
was actually a Seljuk Shahzada.

136
00:21:57,530 --> 00:22:01,460
But what is your intention
of telling me this news, Selcan Hatun?

137
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:06,860
I saw what you can do with
a piece of information, Kurdoglu.

138
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:21,960
My father and uncle Kurdoglu
went on a hunt one day.

139
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:24,230
They were both around our ages then.

140
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:28,560
-Uncle Kurdoglu fell of his horse.
-Why? Did something happen to the horse?

141
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:32,500
The horse had startled because
there was a big bear in front of them.

142
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,900
What did Kurdoglu do?

143
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:38,830
My uncle could not do anything
because his leg was broken.

144
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,530
When that bear was about to
tear my uncle apart...

145
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,400
...my father came and
killed the bear with his spear.

146
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,860
You father is very brave.

147
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:49,060
They became blood brothers then.

148
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,000
Yigit, you will be going tomorrow.

149
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:57,430
When you go, please don’t forget that
you have a brother in Kayi tribe.

150
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,600
Let us go.

151
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:27,330
Yigit...

152
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,030
...look.

153
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:36,560
Run.

154
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:39,320
Oh God, who has given Luqman al-Hakeem the secret...

155
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:42,060
...protect us from incurable troubles.

156
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,240
They are upstairs.

157
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,330
Welcome, Nasir.

158
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:13,560
You called for me, sir.

159
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:22,030
Go to El Aziz immediately and tell him to
stop Kayis from settling at our borders.

160
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:26,360
-But, sir, Titus...
-I cannot waste time by talking about...

161
00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:28,600
...the stupid decisions Titus made.

162
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:34,800
He is only a pawn
who thinks he is a vizier.

163
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:38,960
It is very hard to dissuade
El Aziz from his decision.

164
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:41,530
He really liked the Kayis.

165
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:46,720
Is El Aziz's love for the Kayis so much...

166
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:54,060
...to take the risks of infecting
whole Aleppo with plague?

167
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:10,830
Did you manage to find the person
who sent the spies to kill Ertugrul?

168
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:16,560
According to the information I have, the
Templars have mobilized all their spies.

169
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:20,460
I am trying to uncover
their sources within the palace.

170
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,500
Come, Nasir, come. Come.

171
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:31,860
Sir, the problem is important,
I did not want to wait for the morning.

172
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,460
Intelligence have been informing
about the plague in Anatolia.

173
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:42,500
I wanted to be sure whether our potential
allies have been plagued or not.

174
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:47,500
Sir, I know, you like Kayis very much.

175
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:53,120
I also believe that they are cut out for
in case of a Crusaders’ attack...

176
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:57,020
-But...
-But what, Nasir?

177
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:03,360
Sir, unfortunately
most of their livestock have perished.

178
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:06,300
Don’t...

179
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,930
...reject them from our borders, Nasir.

180
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:12,200
Do you understand? Don’t.

181
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:18,860
When he brings the agreement,
I personally want to talk with Ertugrul.

182
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:39,060
Come on now, Gundogdu.
All the Beys have gathered in the tent.

183
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:40,960
Today is the day.

184
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:45,030
Do not talk like
my father has died, Kurdoglu.

185
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:50,200
You are the tribe’s son as much as
you are your father’s son, Gundogdu.

186
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:54,460
Will you sit in your tent like
a woman while your tribe is in trouble?

187
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:02,400
As we move down to the plains from
the highlands the troubles shall cease...

188
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,400
...and my father will get well.

189
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,900
I have nothing else to say, Kurdoglu.

190
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:11,560
Do you know what you will face while going
down to the plains from the highlands?

191
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,800
What are you trying to say, uncle?

192
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,100
I am saying that...

193
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:21,200
...this path we are taking
is not wise, son.

194
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:26,000
This is the headquarter’s decision
and my father’s order.

195
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:28,100
This is my final word, Kurdoglu.

196
00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:32,060
Do you think that I want to be
the acting Bey...

197
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:36,800
...and to sit in the tent
under your father’s shadow?

198
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:38,800
Don’t you know me, Gundogdu?

199
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:43,330
Wasn’t it you who said your father is
too old to perform his Bey duties...

200
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,960
...and asked me to support you
to become the new Bey?

201
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:49,200
Didn’t I tell you that I would be
supporting you until the end?

202
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,300
What is your cause now?

203
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:56,030
I am an old man with only
a few years to live.

204
00:28:56,230 --> 00:29:01,260
I told you numerous times that the tribe
needs a brave, determined Bey like you.

205
00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:06,230
I would like you to trust me
until I save you from these problems...

206
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:09,060
...and make you a Bey in our new home.

207
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:13,960
Come to the point, uncle.

208
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:19,300
I have learned the real identity
the ominous guests Ertugrul brought here.

209
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:26,800
I know that Numan and his son are from
the Seljuk dynasty, they are Shahzadas.

210
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:31,560
Those people you were complaining about
are from the Seljuk dynasty, Hatun.

211
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:37,500
The man called Numan is a Shahzada and
that girl you look down on, is a sultan.

212
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:44,160
If we deliver them...

213
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:47,530
...the Sultan would award our tribe.

214
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:52,860
We can settle in the best places of
Seljuk territory.

215
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:57,930
What do you want from me, Kurdoglu?

216
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,130
Give up on Aleppo.

217
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:07,900
Aleppo will be our doom.

218
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:10,360
We should take them tonight...

219
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:14,360
...and deliver them
to the Sultan, Gundogdu.

220
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:34,800
May God heal you for our sake and
for the sake of Kayi tribe!

221
00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:21,500
My Bey...

222
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,360
...we are ready for the ambush.

223
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:17,200
You look surprised!

224
00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:21,200
Alpargu, leave us.

225
00:34:36,130 --> 00:34:37,460
I was expecting you.

226
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:42,600
But I was not expecting you, Gundogdu.

227
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:49,230
Kurdoglu will go at night
to ambush a tent and kidnap a Shahzada...

228
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:53,100
...and I will miss this party.
How can this be?

229
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:57,980
You wanted them to leave yesterday...

230
00:34:57,980 --> 00:35:00,440
...and today you are guarding their tent, huh?

231
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:06,560
Well, it’s you who is trying to be the tribe’s Bey
by deceiving people with a high hand...

232
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:09,460
...so, let me guard the tents...

233
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:11,200
...uncle.

234
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:15,900
There should be one, guarding the tribe...

235
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:18,160
...to keep it safe from dangerous people!

236
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:22,620
We wouldn’t want people just riding into the tribe swinging their swords.

237
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:30,240
Now tell me, where did you learn
this Shahzada issue?

238
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:35,960
When I went to Kara Toygar
as a messenger, I put out feelers on him.

239
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,060
I connected the dots.

240
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:41,830
Why did you keep it as a secret until now?

241
00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:48,400
I did it for the same reason as Suleyman Shah
who even hid it from his own sons!

242
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:54,400
You are lying.

243
00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:02,160
You asked, I answered.

244
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:08,460
Now, whoever brought you into doubt,
go and question them!

245
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:14,360
The people you have been complaining about
are from the Seljuk dynasty, Hatun.

246
00:36:14,530 --> 00:36:19,000
The man called Numan is a Shahzada and
that girl you look down on, is a sultan.

247
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:53,230
-Brother, I need to talk with you.
-Not now.

248
00:36:53,530 --> 00:36:55,430
-Brother!
-I said, not now, Dundar!

249
00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:51,900
Gundogdu...

250
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:55,600
...is there something wrong?

251
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:01,900
Was it you who told Kurdoglu that
Numan and his son were Shahzadas, Hatun?

252
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:06,430
-What happened?
-Answer me. Did you tell him or not?

253
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:10,360
What Shahzada, Gundogdu?
What are you talking about?

254
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:13,430
What made you so angry?

255
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:16,830
Kurdoglu learned that
they are Shahzadas, Hatun.

256
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:22,930
What did he do then?

257
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:27,530
I don’t know his intention
but he wanted to imprison them.

258
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:31,400
-Where are the Shahzadas?
-They left with Ertugrul.

259
00:38:33,130 --> 00:38:36,100
I want you to take the agreement
to El Aziz, Ertugrul.

260
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:38,460
But brother,
my father gave this duty to you.

261
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:41,060
Very well, and I am giving it to you.

262
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:44,040
We should do what we know best, Ertugrul.

263
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,400
Don’t you always say...

264
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,180
let the headquarter be yours
and hunt mine?

265
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:54,560
-And you let them go? What are you up to?
-What is it to you?

266
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:58,830
-Did you tell him or not?
-I did not tell, Gundogdu.

267
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:02,160
What business can I have with Kurdoglu?

268
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:06,230
Did Kurdoglu tell you
that he heard it from me?

269
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:13,800
He said that it was someone else.
But if you told him, Hatun...

270
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,130
...may God be my witness that...

271
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:21,100
You were not like this.
Something happened to you.

272
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:25,600
Don’t you trust the woman
who is carrying your child in her womb?

273
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,500
To your wife who is going to
give you a son?

274
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:51,430
My Bey, Ertugrul and his Alps have left.

275
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:55,030
Round up the men you trust,
they should go after them.

276
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,430
Tell them not to refrain from
shedding blood if needed.
