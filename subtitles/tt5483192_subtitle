1
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,000
1! 2! 3! 4!

2
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,880
- 1!
- 2! 3! 4!

3
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,640
1! 2! 3! 4!

4
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,360
1! 2! 3! 4!

5
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,720
Hello. I'm waiting for him.

6
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,000
You are telling me now?

7
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,960
Sir, shall I serve you vegetable rice?

8
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,160
No. I'm already tensed since morning.

9
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,680
I'm not able to have
breakfast peacefully.

10
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,840
What if the shooting gets cancelled?

11
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,480
Okay. Please send somebody else, sir.

12
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,240
- 1! 2! 3! 4!
- Hurry up, sir.

13
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,600
- It's urgent.
- What's going on?

14
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,960
The solo dancer met
with an accident, sir.

15
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,880
So what can I do?

16
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,200
With just two cameras and
junior dancers, how can we shoot?

17
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,080
Sir, please wait.
Let's me check what's going on there.

18
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,800
- What do we do now?
- Keep talking.

19
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,200
- He will surely send somebody else.
- Just shut up.

20
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,800
- Sir--
- Sir, why are you getting angry?

21
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,760
Ask him.

22
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,040
The solo dancer met
with an accident, sir.

23
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,400
What? The solo dancer
met with an accident, sir?

24
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,760
Yes, sir.

25
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,480
- What's his condition?
- He is serious.

26
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,520
- So he won't come.
- No, sir.

27
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,040
Forget about him. What about us?

28
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,400
I need 5 lakhs rupees by evening
to pay people. Where will I get it from?

29
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,640
Don't worry.

30
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,360
You've put up such a wonderful set.
There's dance master Tribuvan...

31
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,840
...there are dancers, there's everybody.

32
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,840
You want the song to be good and
I will make a wonderful song for you.

33
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,680
What about the solo dancer?

34
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,920
My assistant is a good dancer.

35
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,360
He looks like a hero.
He will do a wonderful job. Don't worry.

36
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,920
- Are you confident?
- 100 percent.

37
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,480
- Sure?
- 101 percent.

38
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,680
- I needn't worry?
- No.

39
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,280
- Can I believe you? Who is he?
- Yes.

40
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,560
Dev!

41
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,240
 "Dynamic Prince!"

42
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,960
 "You are--"

43
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,080
 "You are--"

44
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,360
 "You are done for."

45
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,080
 "You are done for."

46
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:39,760
 "All you people,
give way, the dynamic prince is coming."

47
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:45,920
 "All you people,
give way, the dynamic prince is coming."

48
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,960
 "Making millions, people became rich."

49
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,800
 "At last, they only owned a grave."

50
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,720
 "Hey you, let's become hero."

51
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:58,000
 "There will be problems in life."

52
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,720
 "You are done for."

53
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:03,560
 You are done for."

54
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,840
 "You are done for."

55
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,480
 "You are done for."

56
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,800
 "You are done for."

57
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,480
 "You are done for."

58
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:21,680
 "All you people,
give way, the dynamic prince is coming."

59
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,600
 "Prince."

60
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,680
 "Getting greedy,
don't hurt your loved ones..."

61
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,880
 "...and then try to give excuses."

62
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,640
 "Prince. Dynamic Prince."

63
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,840
 "If you think you are the
most intelligent man in the world..."

64
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,880
 "...you are a biggest fool."

65
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:09,760
 "If you know how to get fooled..."

66
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:15,920
 "...the person with
you himself will fool you."

67
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,440
 "Confront life without fear."

68
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,640
 "There will be ups and downs in life."

69
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,680
 "You are done for."

70
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,640
 "You are done for."

71
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,560
 "You are done for."

72
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,440
 "You are done for."

73
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,680
 "If the baby doesn't cry,
it won't get milk."

74
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,000
 "And if you want
to live life without..."

75
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,800
 "...toiling hard, even wealth
is not enough."

76
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,400
 "Prince. Dynamic Prince."

77
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,480
 "After you enjoy seeing the moon..."

78
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,640
 "...don't try to stitch clothes for it."

79
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:26,040
 "It is bad era."

80
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:32,320
 "People are only after money."

81
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,320
 "Wake up. Wake up now."

82
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,480
 "Life is not as you think it is."

83
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:41,440
 "You are done for."

84
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:44,400
 "You are done for."

85
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:47,400
 "You are done for."

86
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,280
 "You are done for."

87
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,760
 "Dynamic Prince."

88
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,960
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

89
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,920
I will call you later.

90
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,720
Has everyone come?

91
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,240
- They've been waiting for you, sir.
- Okay.

92
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,360
What about the boy?

93
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,920
We asked him to come at 11.
He will come.

94
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:32,920
Okay.

95
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,720
We came on time.

96
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,000
- Hi, Vignesh.
- Hi.

97
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,160
Hi. How are you?

98
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,480
- Good. Hello, Venktesh.
- Yeah. Please sit.

99
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,720
- Did I keep you waiting?
- No. We came just five minutes back.

100
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,840
- Krishna, bring coffee.
- Okay, sir.

101
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,760
Venktesh,
did he narrate the story to you?

102
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,320
It seems he left a DVD.

103
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,960
What? DVD?

104
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,240
I don't know much about it. I was
busy yesterday, hence I couldn't watch.

105
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,240
- Krishna.
- Yes, okay.

106
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,080
- Play the DVD.
- Okay, sir.

107
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,640
It seems this is how the
younger generation narrate stories.

108
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,200
100 percent.
People will surely like the story.

109
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,480
It's a wonderful story.
It is very interesting.

110
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:07,080
Is he crazy? He is supposed to narrate
the story, but he has given a DVD.

111
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:07,920
I liked it very much.

112
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,960
Does it have story?

113
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,440
He has taken options from crazy people.

114
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,600
Krishna, switch it off.

115
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:16,320
Vignesh, it seems to be different.

116
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,760
Let's wait and watch.

117
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,720
It is a wonderful story.

118
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,440
We are curious to know the climax.

119
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,120
The interval block is good.

120
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,360
And the story narration is wonderful.

121
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,960
I liked the twist in the story.

122
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,680
Sir, he's here.

123
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,200
Send him in.

124
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,160
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

125
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,320
Come, sit.

126
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,040
Hello, sir.

127
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,000
- Hello.
- Hello.

128
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,320
Sit.

129
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,240
- What is your name?
- Dev.

130
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,960
I heard the story is very good.

131
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,200
I saw the DVD.

132
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,280
Oh.

133
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,760
But now,
I want you to narrate the story.

134
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,840
- Okay, sir.
- Okay.

135
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,880
- Krishna, wait outside.
- Okay.

136
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,680
Sir, just a minute. Let Krishna be here.

137
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,640
Why?

138
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,640
We all are from film industry.

139
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,120
We see story from
a different view point.

140
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,320
They will watch from
audience view point.

141
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,080
You need the suggestions from
two persons for a good story, sir.

142
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,920
Quite interesting. Okay. Get started.

143
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,000
- Okay. Sir, my story--
- Please wait.

144
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,120
You say you will narrate the story.

145
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,280
Keeping whom in mind as
hero you will narrate the story?

146
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,480
For me, my story
itself is the hero, sir.

147
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,240
Otherwise,
anybody would suit the character.

148
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,720
- But--
- Look, Vignesh, he was right.

149
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,360
Look, whoever comes
to narrate the story...

150
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,920
...they say the story
itself is the hero.

151
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,680
But when you narrate the story...

152
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,200
...you will have to keep a hero in mind.

153
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,480
Do one thing.

154
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,320
- The story is written by you, right?
- Yes, sir.

155
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,800
Assume you are the hero of
the story and narrate the story.

156
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,960
Okay, sir.

157
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:45,400
Sir, a playground,
an apartment beside the playground.

158
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,240
The hero lives in the last floor.

159
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,120
Good morning.

160
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,040
To hell with your good morning.

161
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,520
I guess the lazy boys
you are still sleeping.

162
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,720
Yes, they are still asleep. I'm up.

163
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,120
You're a talented fellow
who doesn't have time sense.

164
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:34,840
If there is no sincerity,
how will you become a director?

165
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,920
Show your sincerity at least to me.

166
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:42,720
Wake up now.
Get ready fast. It's 8 o'clock.

167
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,080
8?

168
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,160
8?

169
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:45,920
8?

170
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,040
The cabbie would've
called me many times.

171
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,400
16 missed calls.

172
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,040
Hello.

173
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,920
I called you several times.

174
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,360
Your number was busy.

175
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,720
I'm coming. I'm coming in 10 minutes.

176
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,200
Come here.

177
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,840
Why are you in a hurry?

178
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,000
He is in a hurry,
because he has to rush to office.

179
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,040
But why are you in a hurry?

180
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,560
I have to go for jogging.

181
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,160
- At 8 o'clock?
- Yes.

182
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,360
People go to jogging at 6...

183
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,240
...because they've to prepare
breakfast for their children.

184
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,560
Some go at 8,
because their college is at 10.

185
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,600
Only then I will be able to lose weight.

186
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,480
I see that.

187
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,680
I'm already late.

188
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,360
Oh my God.

189
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,440
What happened?

190
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,160
I got visa for London.

191
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,680
I have to go.

192
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,040
I also have to brush.

193
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,440
I will do both at the same time.

194
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:35,720
You got the visa, but I already
done with immigration checking.

195
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,400
My driver is in a hurry.

196
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:50,840
Then ask him to go to public toilet.

197
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,600
No. I'm standing with
my pant unzipped. No.

198
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,160
Wait.

199
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,760
Please.

200
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:10,640
You got visa and he is
done with immigration check...

201
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:17,320
...but my flight is already taking off.

202
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,680
Darn it.

203
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,640
The fatso is already flying.

204
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:23,840
 "Will you say yes or will you say no?"

205
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,200
He is singing.

206
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,120
Won't you go to bathroom?

207
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,920
I do both at the same time.

208
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,240
Hi.

209
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,200
Come in.

210
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,400
You didn't say how aunt looks.

211
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,360
Who is aunt here?

212
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,120
It's me.

213
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,240
You are aunt?

214
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,320
I don't believe.

215
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:18,000
How'd anyone dare to call
you aunt in this attire, aunt?

216
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,160
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

217
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:23,040
You look more beautiful
than the film heroines.

218
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:26,440
They should learn how
to become beautiful from you.

219
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,920
No.

220
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,720
What 'no' aunt?

221
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,640
Raveena will come in
the pretext of drawing design.

222
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,480
Aishwarya will come in the
pretext of performing veneration.

223
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,000
Deepika will come in the
pretext of lighting the lamp.

224
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,120
Diana will come in the
pretext of warding off evil eye.

225
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,160
Stop it. Otherwise, she will
ask me to become like Salman Khan.

226
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,160
- Ami... what's his name?
- Amir Khan.

227
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,840
She will threaten me
to become like Amir Khan.

228
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,160
- Serve chutney.
- Did you see?

229
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,000
Uncle agreed to you indirectly.

230
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,000
It is a lie.

231
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,440
A lie? Okay.

232
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,160
So you won't serve breakfast
to the person who lied?

233
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,560
It is my plate. I will serve
in another plate. Keep it here.

234
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,480
Slap me if you want to,
but don't let me starve.

235
00:14:56,520 --> 00:15:00,120
She won't let you starve,
but to slap you, look, she is coming.

236
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,800
Is this the time you come?

237
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,520
I came exactly on breakfast time.

238
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,800
- Come fast. It's getting late.
- Coming.

239
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,200
Hurry up.

240
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,720
It is my new sari. It will get soiled.

241
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,480
- Use uncle's loin cloth.
- What about uncle?

242
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,880
I will get him a sari.

243
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,120
- Bye.
- Idiot.

244
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,440
- Bye, dad.
- See you.

245
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,360
- Pavi, have breakfast.
- Mother, it's already late.

246
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,280
- Have little and go.
- Oh God.

247
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,240
Go slowly.

248
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,880
Did you hear me? Go slowly.

249
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,200
- Okay.
- Mother, I will eat outside. Okay? Bye.

250
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,440
Pavitra, did have a haircut?

251
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,800
No. Why?

252
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,800
Beauty should come naturally.

253
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:56,040
Your hair was so beautiful,
but you have ruined it.

254
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,560
Open your hair.

255
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,200
Hey. What?

256
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,240
Nothing.

257
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,160
Okay.

258
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,840
- Pavi.
- Yes.

259
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,160
Look, it is beautiful dress.

260
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,760
If you wear it,
you will look beautiful than the dummy.

261
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,040
Like the dummy doesn't have head,
you think I don't have mind?

262
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,360
- If you didn't like it, never mind.
- Come.

263
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,360
It is designers wear.
What do I say?

264
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,240
It was not good.

265
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,840
Look, the box is so beautiful.

266
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:41,440
It is not good too.

267
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,440
- Are you crazy?
- Come.

268
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,440
- What are you searching for, Pavi?
- Come.

269
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,120
Look...

270
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:48,320
Hey.

271
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,800
You asked me to hurry
just to buy curtains?

272
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,320
Yes. You select.

273
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,680
How would I know the kind
of dresses you wear in your bedroom?

274
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,880
You do it yourself.

275
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,640
Please, Dev.
You know the colour of my room.

276
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:07,240
It is difficult to handle girls.
Poor boys don't know that.

277
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,640
Stop laughing and show us the curtains.

278
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,800
Which one, sir?

279
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,320
Blue...

280
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,160
Relax. Wait a minute.

281
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,640
- The design next to it.
- This one, sir?

282
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,120
Show me the one in the middle.

283
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,080
- This one?
- Yes.

284
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:25,600
Wow.

285
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,520
Just a minute.

286
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,800
Here you are, sir.

287
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:30,600
Did you like it?

288
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,760
Here, madam.

289
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,120
Superb.

290
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,000
I didn't see it.

291
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,640
Boys not only watch girls,
they also see the dresses they wear.

292
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,800
- Shall we bill it?
- Okay.

293
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:42,600
Come.

294
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,560
Thanks.

295
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,320
Pavi.

296
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:57,600
Pavi.

297
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,000
Yes.

298
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,280
What are you thinking?

299
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:05,240
There is only one thing
I think about all the time.

300
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,720
I will be very happy
if the dream comes true.

301
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,920
You are not only dreaming,
you also working really hard, Pavi.

302
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,040
Your dream will come true. Don't worry.

303
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,400
Drink.

304
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,200
Do you love me?

305
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,440
Please tell me. Do you love me?

306
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:22,120
- Say it for once.
- That's not so.

307
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,560
I'm asking you since days.

308
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:24,800
Do you love me?

309
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,000
Drink.

310
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,520
I'm drinking it, I can't eat it.

311
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,120
Good serve!

312
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,680
- Come on!
- Come on! Give!

313
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,160
Kill it!

314
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,400
Come on!

315
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,320
Pass the ball. Come on, Lacchu!

316
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,440
Well done, Lacchu!

317
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,800
Lacchu.

318
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:01,160
Lacchu.

319
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,480
Come on!

320
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,240
Well done. Pass it to Lacchu.

321
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,840
- Lacchu.
- Yes.

322
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,720
You are playing really well.
You justified your captainship.

323
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:13,480
Not just become a captain. I
want to get selected for the state team.

324
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,720
Don't worry.
You will achieve it one day.

325
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:16,920
Thank you, sir.

326
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:17,480
Good luck.

327
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,000
Lacchu!

328
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,160
- Hi.
- Lacchu!

329
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,640
It was very good.

330
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,240
What?

331
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:26,840
Your game.

332
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,880
Lacchu.

333
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,400
Who is it?

334
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,440
It's Lacchu.

335
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,560
Lacchu!

336
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,360
I will open the door.

337
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:57,080
Lacchu!

338
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,480
Be decent.

339
00:19:59,160 --> 00:19:59,960
Hi.

340
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,720
Stop it.

341
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,040
Where is Dev?

342
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,120
He is there.

343
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,880
Hi, Dev. What are you doing?

344
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,400
He is writing to his father.

345
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,760
Oh. He is writing to my father-in-law.

346
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,960
Writing letter about me?

347
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:24,520
Laxmi, we are your friends,
doesn't mean you behave like this.

348
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,160
It is the nature of the law
to get attracted to each other.

349
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,480
If the fruit is pure, it will
be kept before God for veneration.

350
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:33,120
If the woman is pious, they
will respect her. Try to understand.

351
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:36,000
What, Dev? I was here to give breakfast.

352
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,120
You gave it, leave now.

353
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,520
Look, she has brought something.

354
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,160
It's over.

355
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:47,920
They will eat anything you give them.

356
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,680
Dev, I brought it for you.

357
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,400
Even if they eat,
my stomach will get filled. Please go.

358
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,400
You are arrogant to me all the time.

359
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,360
You always avoid me.

360
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,560
What did you say?

361
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,920
When you don't even listen to me...

362
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,720
...how will you understand me?

363
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,480
Darn it.

364
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,480
Did you eat everything?

365
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,320
I thought I will have it yesterday...

366
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:24,440
Vidya, you came to me.

367
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:28,840
When I held your hand, you kicked me.

368
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,120
At last, I'm drinking liquor in grief.

369
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,520
Just shut up.

370
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:37,160
Das alias Devdas.

371
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,120
You fell in love,
but you know nothing about love.

372
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:43,360
Like liquor cures
hangover of the liquor...

373
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:46,360
...similarly,
only a girl can cure girl's hangover.

374
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,320
Get married immediately.

375
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,680
- It's impossible.
- Why?

376
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:56,480
Vidya climbed on my
heart wearing heels sandal.

377
00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:01,400
She walked away, but her footprints...

378
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,000
She ditched you.

379
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,680
Footprints.

380
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,040
Footprints.

381
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:11,120
If one pancake gets ruined,
you can make another one.

382
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:14,520
But if the pan itself is broken,
what will you do?

383
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,000
- I will have the batter.
- Idiot.

384
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:20,360
Pancake batter or mosquito spray?

385
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,520
Hey, I'm serious.

386
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:25,400
Yes, you and I are
talking about it seriously.

387
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:28,480
Look, even though Veda changes,
Vidya will never change.

388
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,200
- Forget her.
- That's right.

389
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,080
I can't.

390
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:36,200
Drunkards realize the next
morning what they said last night.

391
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,920
We are fools to listen to him.

392
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:46,320
People set alarm to wake up,
but you fix alarm to sleep.

393
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,320
Be quiet.

394
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:50,840
If I don't message Pavi at 10,
she will come here and create ruckus.

395
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:54,480
I know you both very well.

396
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,360
No matter how much you
quarrel with each other...

397
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,000
...you will make up within few minutes.

398
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,320
But only I know the pain
I go through in those few minutes.

399
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,680
You just--

400
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:04,560
Okay.

401
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,840
You talk about few minutes...

402
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:10,240
...but I lost Vidya forever,
I painful it'd be for me.

403
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,360
Alright.

404
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,600
Pavi.

405
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,960
Wake up. You are sleeping
without having dinner.

406
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,240
No, mother. I'm not hungry.

407
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,320
Your health will get spoilt
if you sleep empty stomach.

408
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,880
Get up and have dinner.

409
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,400
Oh. You have temperature.

410
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,040
You have fever.

411
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,640
- Let's go to the doctor. Get up.
- No, mother.

412
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:37,000
I will be fine if I rest.

413
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:41,760
Get up. You have temperature.
You think you'll be fine if you rest?

414
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,560
Come on, mother.
I hate injections and pills.

415
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,280
You never listen to me.

416
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,080
Your father is not back yet.

417
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,200
- I will call Dev.
- No, mother.

418
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,680
- Be quiet.
- Don't call him.

419
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,840
Look, he has also messaged.

420
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,320
Hello, Pavi.

421
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,840
Not Pavi, aunt here.

422
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:02,520
Tell me, aunt.

423
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:05,480
Pavi has fever.
She has high temperature.

424
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,560
She is sleeping without having dinner.

425
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,000
And she is refusing to come to doctor.

426
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,920
Please tell her.

427
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,400
Okay aunt, I will come right away.

428
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,480
Okay, come fast.

429
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,440
Vishu--

430
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:23,840
Come in.

431
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,600
Come. She has fever.
She has high temperature.

432
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,680
- She is refusing to come to doctor.
- Aunt, relax. Where is she?

433
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,000
- She is upstairs. Come.
- I will go and check.

434
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:32,640
Pavi.

435
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:33,880
Pa...

436
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,040
Pavi.

437
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:41,200
Get up. You have high temperature.

438
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,200
Why did you refuse to go to doctor?
Get up.

439
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,800
I will be fine by morning.

440
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,760
Not morning,
I want you to become fine right now.

441
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,320
Get up. I said get up.

442
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,800
I want sleep.

443
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,040
Sleep after you visit the doctor.
Let's go.

444
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,680
- Aunt, give me a shawl.
- Okay.

445
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:54,520
Get up.

446
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,920
Listen to me.

447
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,720
What happened?

448
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,240
You have to say what happened, doctor.

449
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,840
Will the fever subside at once?

450
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,480
I'm examining her. Be quiet.

451
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,800
What? I won't go even if you want me to.

452
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:14,760
Go on.

453
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,840
Doctor, will the fever subside
today itself if she consumes the pills?

454
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,440
Not today, it will subside in two days.

455
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,200
Then why do you prescribe such pills?

456
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,680
Prescribe something by which
she will be fine today itself.

457
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,640
Am I the doctor or you?

458
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,320
Come on, doctor.

459
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:32,520
I brought the patient to you
and you ask me if you are a doctor?

460
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:36,600
Mister, it is not ordinary fever.
It is infection.

461
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,520
If it is infection, then inject her.
You are a doctor.

462
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,360
Don't I know that? You will teach me?

463
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,800
That's why I am doing, doctor.

464
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,880
I mean what's wrong in teaching
things that you don't know?

465
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,360
Dev.
Be quiet.

466
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,440
Doctor, please give the prescription.

467
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,920
Doctor, how much is the fees?

468
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:53,840
Pay it in the reception.

469
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,800
Should I bring her tomorrow?

470
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:00,320
If she's fine,
don't come, otherwise, come.

471
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,720
Then she won't be fine by today.

472
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,000
Okay.

473
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:05,200
When should she take the pills?
After food or before food?

474
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,440
After food.

475
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,280
What about her diet?

476
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,520
Bread, milk, starch, curd rice...

477
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:12,800
Doctor, she doesn't
all this when she is fine...

478
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,480
...now that she is unwell,
how will she be able to eat all this?

479
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:18,240
- Give her something.
- Okay.

480
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,040
Dev.

481
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:19,720
Doctor.

482
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,240
Oh, no.

483
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:23,600
Nurse.

484
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,680
Let's go. He fainted.

485
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,800
- They are back.
- Coming.

486
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,160
What did the doctor say?

487
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,320
He is a very bad doctor, uncle.

488
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,240
Why? What happened?

489
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,080
Forget it. It's a big story.

490
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,240
Please go and bring hot water.

491
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,440
Let she go upstairs and rest.

492
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,120
Okay.

493
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:45,760
Go.

494
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:47,680
Dev.

495
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,400
Uncle.

496
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:53,200
Even the sun that rises
everyday sets its time is over.

497
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,440
But you are not like that.

498
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,920
When someone is in trouble,
you come at any time.

499
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,000
You will be happy.

500
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,080
Uncle, I will be happy
if all of you are happy.

501
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,040
Go.

502
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,680
Slowly. Slowly.

503
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,840
Did you see? You have high
fever and you refuse to go to doctor.

504
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,600
- Aunt, here you are.
- Yes.

505
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,240
Here, have some.

506
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,120
- Give it to me. I will feed her.
- No, I will feed her.

507
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,720
You go to sleep, aunt. I will feed her.

508
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,080
I will eat only little.

509
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,800
Obviously. Will you be able
to eat as much as what the doctor said?

510
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,080
I will feed you very little.

511
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,440
Here, have the pill.

512
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,600
- Medicine?
- Yes, medicine.

513
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,160
Careful.

514
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:45,640
Dev.

515
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,160
Dev.

516
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:51,200
You didn't go home? You stayed here?

517
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:57,000
You had high fever, hence I stayed back.

518
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,680
It's just fever,
why do you worry so much?

519
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,320
You falling ill is
like heart failure to me.

520
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,920
Okay. How are you?

521
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,880
I'm fine. You go and rest.

522
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:14,960
Okay.

523
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,520
Are you sure?

524
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,080
Yes.

525
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:22,640
Bye.

526
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,920
Bye. Take care.

527
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,560
Sir, greetings. How are you?

528
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,920
I'm fine.

529
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,520
I have good news.

530
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:43,960
There is a producer
named Bidappa in Madekeri.

531
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,320
He is looking for a good story.

532
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,120
I have recommended your name.

533
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,160
Thank you, sir.

534
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,360
Don't thank me.
I know who talented you are.

535
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,120
You are going to
Madekeri tomorrow itself.

536
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,400
Okay, sir. I will go.

537
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:58,240
This year belongs to you, Dev.
God bless you.

538
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,600
Thank you, sir. Thank you so much.

539
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,720
I'm wearing shoes.

540
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,840
You naughty...

541
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,640
Hey.

542
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,040
Why didn't you come home last night?

543
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,440
Pavi was ill.

544
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,480
- How is she?
- She's fine.

545
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:21,800
Where are you going?
Let's go for jogging.

546
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:26,640
Buddy, I'm not fat like you.
You carry on.

547
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,680
I have to go to Madekeri to
narrate the story to the producer.

548
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,480
- Where? You are going to Madekeri?
- Yes.

549
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:36,120
Buddy, you are going to Madekeri.
Please bring homemade liquor.

550
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,240
I am going to Madekeri to
narrate the story to the producer.

551
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,480
Not to bring liquor.

552
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:42,120
Buddy.

553
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:45,080
The producer will be
impressed with your story.

554
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,400
You are very talented.

555
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:49,080
I will surely play
comedian in your films.

556
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:52,520
You are very intelligent.
Please bring liquor.

557
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,400
Alright. I will bring.

558
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,600
I'm going to sleep. No one disturb me.

559
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,400
Disturb you?

560
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:06,040
I will kill the one who disturbs you.
I won't spare even the mosquitoes.

561
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,200
Bye, buddy.

562
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:10,480
Madekeri liquor.

563
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,400
What if he forgets to bring it?

564
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:14,640
Buddy, Madekeri liquor.

565
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:20,200
Buddy, listen to me.
I want only whiskey. I want one bottle.

566
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,920
What happened?
I looked everywhere in the ground...

567
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:37,520
...but I don't see any girl.

568
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,440
Hi, darling.

569
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:42,840
Hi.

570
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,720
Hi.

571
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,080
Hi.

572
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,840
Hi, darling.

573
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,880
Offer biscuit to uncle too.

574
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,040
I won't.

575
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,240
She got scared.

576
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,360
Take her to the liquor
and get her amulet.

577
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,360
Actually, she got scared seeing you.

578
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,120
Why?

579
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,760
Because your face is very rare.

580
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,160
Otherwise,
she would've thrown the biscuit to you.

581
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,560
What? She would've thrown biscuit to me?

582
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,360
Sorry. She would've offered.

583
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,480
Shall we go?

584
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,360
- Yes.
- Let's go.

585
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,640
Did you get scared seeing uncle?

586
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,480
- Yes, mother.
- Hi.

587
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:37,560
Hi, Vishwa.

588
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,720
- Hi.
- Are you going to work?

589
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:39,640
Yes.

590
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:42,240
He said you were unwell. How are you?

591
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,880
I'm fine. Where is Dev?

592
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:44,720
He is sleeping inside.

593
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:45,680
Okay. Bye.

594
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:46,320
Bye.

595
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,240
He is sleeping.

596
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:52,080
He told me not to allow
anyone to disturb him.

597
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,880
Move aside, fatso.

598
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,720
What? Fatso?

599
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:56,960
Sorry. Dev.

600
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:57,800
Dev.

601
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,920
Dev, come on, get up.

602
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,640
Dev, please get up.

603
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,640
Pavi, you're already here?

604
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:09,080
I'm sorry.
Get ready fast. We need to go somewhere.

605
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,120
You get angry if we wake you up.

606
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,680
She's our friend.

607
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,640
You wake up when girls
come and sleep when boys come?

608
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:19,560
Sleep.

609
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,360
That's how boys are.

610
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,120
I see.

611
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,160
- Idiot. You go and get ready.
- Okay.

612
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,760
- I was talking about boys.
- Go.

613
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:26,520
- Useless.
- You.

614
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:28,520
I will slap you.

615
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:38,400
Pavi, where are we going?

616
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,360
To Modagalu(clouds).

617
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:39,960
Modagalu?

618
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,560
We are going to Modagalu.

619
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,600
- New course.
- Okay.

620
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,200
If I complete it,
my dream will come true.

621
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,080
Very good.

622
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:49,080
I have to update any new course
which is relevant to my studies.

623
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,400
Correct.
Which way?

624
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,320
Keep going, I will tell you.

625
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,280
Okay.

626
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,720
Coming Monday is the last day.

627
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:08,000
- So come and register at the earliest.
- Okay.

628
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:08,840
- Okay?
- Sure.

629
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:11,840
Yes.

630
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:12,920
- Thank you.
- You are welcome.

631
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:14,920
Hi.

632
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,360
Yes? How can I help you?

633
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,360
- The new course called Clouds.
- Yes.

634
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,080
I want the details.

635
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,680
Do you have work experience?

636
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:22,160
Yes.

637
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,000
Okay. That's fine.

638
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,640
It will be three months course.

639
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:27,800
Rs. 60,000 fees and we
have only limited seats, ma'am.

640
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,960
Okay. No problem.
I will join as soon as possible.

641
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:30,760
- Okay. Sure.
- Thank you.

642
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,640
- Pavi.
- Yes.

643
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:37,840
Rs. 60,000 is the fees. What
if you get a job abroad before that?

644
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,960
If you need something,
you will have to sacrifice something.

645
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,840
Okay. You just want to keep studying.

646
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:46,120
Don't talk cheap about education.

647
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,200
What do you know about education?

648
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:49,560
Okay?

649
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,600
Okay.

650
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:55,640
Love for caring and
knowledge for argument.

651
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:57,600
Knowledge is just for experience.

652
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:00,040
Just one word is enough for salvation.

653
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,640
I'm a follower of Sarvagyna.

654
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:06,400
If Sarvagyna was alive,
he would've at least done graduation.

655
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,640
Okay. Are you free now?

656
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,160
Yes. Why?

657
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:11,800
Shall we go for movie?

658
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:13,400
Okay.

659
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,320
Alright. Wait.

660
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,560
I will call Nani.

661
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:19,920
Hello.

662
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:22,200
Hello, Nani.
Come to Meenakshi mall immediately.

663
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:22,960
Why?

664
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,880
Someone has left one peg of liquor,
come and drink it.

665
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:26,800
Am I so cheap?

666
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,880
Then why would anyone
call you to the mall?

667
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,320
- Let's go for a movie.
- Okay.

668
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:32,920
Let's go. He said he will come.

669
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,160
Dev, I liked the songs very much.

670
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,240
Right. Me too.

671
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,120
Did you like the hero?

672
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:41,840
Yes.

673
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,040
- Heroine?
- Yes.

674
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,000
What about fights?

675
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:44,840
Too perfect.

676
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,320
Did you like the villain?

677
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,040
Yes.

678
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,240
Did you like me?

679
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,040
Dev.

680
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,720
He is calling now. Idiot.

681
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:59,800
That's unfair.
Why didn't you come for the movie?

682
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:03,640
I'm sorry. A girl from Kerala
mesmerised me with her eyes.

683
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:09,000
Buddy, I called to remind
you to bring liquor from Madekeri--

684
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,320
I'm going to Madekeri tomorrow.

685
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,680
I will get it. What's the hurry?

686
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:15,400
- Hang up.
- Okay, buddy.

687
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,480
- Dev.
- Yes.

688
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:17,840
Are you going to Madekeri?

689
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:18,600
Yes.

690
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:19,480
Why?

691
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,920
To narrate the story to the producer.

692
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,040
Why didn't you tell me?

693
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,800
When I left from your house,
the manager called me...

694
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,440
...and asked me to meet the producer.

695
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:29,840
I was asleep at home,
you came and took me to the institute...

696
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,600
...and then we came here. I forgot.

697
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:32,320
Okay.

698
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:35,600
I will listen to your story
first and then the producer. Okay?

699
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:38,920
Okay.
But Pavi, aren't you getting late?

700
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:39,840
Won't you go home?

701
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:41,560
One minute.

702
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,520
Yes, Pavi.

703
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:50,760
Hello, mother. Dev and I have
come to the mall to watch movie.

704
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,320
I will go to Dev's
house and come tomorrow.

705
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:53,960
Is it okay?

706
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,400
Okay. Do that.

707
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,480
Don't forget to have dinner.

708
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:58,760
Okay, mother.

709
00:36:59,120 --> 00:36:59,760
Bye.

710
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,440
Bye.

711
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:02,440
Okay?

712
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,040
- Yes.
- Never mind. It'll be interesting. Go on.

713
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,160
- Snacks!
- Hi.

714
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,280
Give it to me. Please.

715
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,960
Sit here. You will be comfortable.

716
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:15,240
You never bring snacks
when we are drinking liquor.

717
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:15,800
Give me.

718
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:16,760
You keep eating all the time.

719
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:20,320
I brought this because our director
will be narrating the story today.

720
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:23,200
Pavi, when Dev starts
narrating the story...

721
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,920
...it is more like watching the move.

722
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,240
His narration is so interesting.

723
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,680
You guys are here.

724
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:30,520
Are you ready to listen?

725
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,720
Yes. Get started.

726
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:37,520
Buddy, tell a story which has fights,
bloodshed, murder, riots.

727
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:38,400
Shut up.

728
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,760
There are no such things in my story.

729
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:43,880
We shouldn't encourage
the audience about bad things.

730
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:47,480
In my story,
there will be husband and wife, lovers.

731
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:50,400
There is also a character
like Vidya in my story.

732
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:11,120
 "Girl."

733
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:16,200
 "Girl."

734
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:23,320
 "Agree to me."

735
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:36,960
 "I'll be dead if I see your smile."

736
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:44,720
 "Golden deer,
if I come after you, I'm finished."

737
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:49,360
 "You never replied to my message."

738
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:53,120
 "O boy, I surrender myself to you."

739
00:38:53,160 --> 00:39:00,640
 "I'm not such kind of a guy."

740
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,280
 "Hey girl."

741
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:08,120
 "You are very dangerous."

742
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:15,800
 "If I come after you,
people will laugh at me."

743
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:25,000
 "I'll be dead if I see your smile."

744
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:32,560
 "Golden deer,
if I come after you, I'm finished."

745
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,760
 "You got it all."

746
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,640
 "Say."

747
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,600
 "Say something."

748
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:39,480
 "Say."

749
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,200
 "Say something."

750
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:43,080
 "Say."

751
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,800
 "Say something."

752
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:56,360
 "I don't want shopping.
I don't want cinema."

753
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,680
 "Just love me forever."

754
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:04,000
 "Don't gaze at me. Don't touch me."

755
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:07,480
 "Get going from here."

756
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:15,560
 "When you smile at me,
I go head over heels."

757
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:19,640
 "I'm not the one who
falls for your beauty."

758
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:23,080
 "Stay away from me."

759
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:27,000
 "I'm a teenage girl."

760
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:30,840
 "My lips are damaged."

761
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:35,040
 "I'm not such kind of a guy."

762
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:41,040
 "Hey girl."

763
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,840
 "You are very dangerous."

764
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:53,240
 "If I come after you,
people will laugh at me."

765
00:40:54,920 --> 00:41:02,840
 "I'll be dead if I see your smile."

766
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:09,400
 "Golden deer,
if I come after you, I'm finished."

767
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:42,440
 "You have now become
the need of my life."

768
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:50,200
 "You try to beguile with
your talks and kiss me."

769
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:58,200
 "When I come close to you,
why do you run away from me?"

770
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:05,800
 "I have no time to fall in love.
Stay away from me."

771
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:09,800
 "I'm a teenage girl."

772
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:13,560
 "My lips are damaged."

773
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:20,880
 "I'm not such kind of a guy."

774
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,480
 "Hey girl."

775
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:28,760
 "You are very dangerous."

776
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:35,280
 "If I come after you,
people will laugh at me."

777
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:45,520
 "I'll be dead if I see your smile."

778
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:52,160
 "Golden deer,
if I come after you, I'm finished."

779
00:42:56,560 --> 00:43:01,160
Lacchu! Lacchu!
Aren't you going to coaching classes?

780
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,240
Oh God.

781
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:03,880
- Are you coming?
- Coming, father.

782
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:06,520
Oh God. I'm late.

783
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:19,840
Dev.

784
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:21,840
It's morning.

785
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:28,440
Morning.

786
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,520
Dev, I will go home.

787
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:31,400
Okay.

788
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:34,400
Did you like my story?

789
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:36,520
The story is superb.

790
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:40,000
Your narration is
like watching the movie.

791
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:41,680
Your story is interesting.

792
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:45,240
Pavi.

793
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:49,880
Did you really like my story?

794
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:51,760
I liked it very much.

795
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:53,320
Did you like me?

796
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:56,400
Dev, this is too much. Bye.

797
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:59,760
Pavi, have coffee and go.

798
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:01,040
No, thanks.

799
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:05,520
Want to have coffee?

800
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:09,560
Oh God.

801
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:11,760
What about you girls?

802
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:16,240
No one wants to have coffee with me.

803
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:18,640
You only drink liquor.

804
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:32,640
What are you doing?

805
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:34,840
Buddy, I see myself there.

806
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:39,560
That's for people who
are intelligent and not fat.

807
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:41,440
Why? What will happen if I'm there?

808
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:43,000
Nothing, the wall will break.

809
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:46,080
Forget that.

810
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:49,080
You are going to Madekeri,
bring the stuff.

811
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:52,120
If you say stuff again, I will kick you.

812
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:53,800
- Why?
- I won't get it.

813
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:55,720
Please don't do that, Dev.

814
00:44:56,560 --> 00:45:00,320
That's the only thing
which can ease my pain.

815
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:05,840
I still haven't forgotten Vidya and
if you don't bring liquor, I will die.

816
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:09,880
I don't know if you are
addicted to girls or liquor.

817
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:12,840
If you binge drink,
you will die very soon.

818
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:14,240
You.

819
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:15,760
Check who is it.

820
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,640
Coming.

821
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:18,200
Who...?

822
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:20,240
Dev.

823
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:22,720
Lacchu, what happened?

824
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:25,640
Look here, tell me what happened?

825
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:29,360
Rupa, come on. Come. Move.

826
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:31,760
Move. Why are you standing here?

827
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:34,320
Sir, there is no air in the ball.

828
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,440
I forgot the air pump.

829
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:38,880
There are no shops around, sir.

830
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:41,080
If you so careless, none of you
will get selected for the state team.

831
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,640
Lacchu, I had confidence on you.

832
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:47,560
Instead of wandering around, couldn't
you keep all these things in mind?

833
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:49,480
Okay. One of you bring the ball.

834
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:51,280
Sir, shall I come?

835
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:52,880
Come.

836
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:56,640
If you want to get selected in the
state team, you should have seriousness.

837
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:58,800
- Don't be careless.
- Sorry, sir.

838
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:01,120
You do the same mistake repeatedly.

839
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:03,280
Darn it.

840
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:06,360
Today's Friday,
she must've gone to the temple.

841
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:12,000
Come.

842
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:16,440
Lacchu, the pump is there. Fill the air.

843
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:18,000
- I will freshen up and come.
- Okay, sir.

844
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:31,360
 "Come, my beloved."

845
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:35,320
 "Come, my beloved."

846
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:47,480
Lacchu, stop watching TV.
We are getting late. Let's go.

847
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:50,440
Sir, it is my favourite song.
Please, sir.

848
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:52,720
Show the same interest on the game.

849
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:54,640
- Let's go.
- Okay, sir.

850
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:16,720
No!

851
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:18,640
He tried to misbehave with me.

852
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:20,160
But I managed to get away.

853
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:23,960
Who is responsible for it?

854
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:28,000
What do you mean?
Only two of us were there.

855
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:30,120
You are responsible
for him to misbehave.

856
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:35,520
A lotus blooms in muck
so that it is safe from people.

857
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:38,720
A rose grows with
thorns to protect itself.

858
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:43,160
When flowers can protect themselves
though they don't last long...

859
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:46,360
...you girls have to save
your honour all your life...

860
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:48,480
...you need to be more protective.

861
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,800
I scolded you the other day so that
you don't come across such situation.

862
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:55,320
Shouldn't girls be like
the way they want to be?

863
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:57,280
Don't we have the freedom?

864
00:47:57,560 --> 00:48:00,440
Freedom is not given,
one had to attain it.

865
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:04,320
I'm just telling you the kind of
freedom you have attained. That's all.

866
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,880
Okay. What do you want to do now?

867
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:09,600
Do you want to lodge
complaint against him?

868
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:10,400
Me?

869
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:12,120
No, should I ask the
girl next door to it?

870
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:13,200
That's not so, Dev.

871
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:16,640
He has been a coach in our
college for the last 12 years.

872
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:20,360
If we lodge complaint against him,
my hard work of 12 year will go in vain.

873
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:21,800
Come with me.

874
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:28,640
Buddy, you say she is your girl.
Won't you go?

875
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:34,960
I can go, but I might kill him.

876
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:00,800
Hey! Are you blind?

877
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:03,080
Who is blind? Beat him.

878
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:07,080
Beat him!

879
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,480
Those who misbehave with girls
will be given the same punishment.

880
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:19,920
Either I should thrash him.

881
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:21,880
How dare you mess with you?

882
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:23,720
Or watch him being thrashed.

883
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:25,200
Are you happy?

884
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:26,920
Dev, let's go from here immediately.

885
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:40,480
It I who call, it my currency that's
getting over, but why does he get upset?

886
00:49:57,600 --> 00:50:03,760
 "Come close to me."

887
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:06,480
 "Where are you?"

888
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:09,160
Your mouth stinks.

889
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:22,880
 "Come close to me."

890
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:32,160
Hi, Dev. What happened? Did you make it?

891
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:35,120
Almost. The producer
liked the story very much.

892
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:40,880
Not just the producer,
even the audience will like the film.

893
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:41,720
Don't worry.

894
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:42,840
Thanks.

895
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:44,360
Alright. Come here, let's meet.

896
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:48,040
Pavi, Nani wants to party.

897
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:49,280
Why should I throw party?

898
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:52,440
Not you, I'm throwing a party,
so please join us.

899
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:56,080
Oh. Sorry, Dev. I have work to do.

900
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:57,680
In case, I'm able to come...

901
00:50:57,960 --> 00:50:59,360
...I will call you and come.

902
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:01,840
Okay. Bye.

903
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:02,800
Bye.

904
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,000
Hey! Lacchu!

905
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:12,240
Lacchu!

906
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:13,600
Touch my cheeks.

907
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:15,160
Lacchu!

908
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:16,680
Lacchu!

909
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:21,800
Lacchu, it is a boring name.

910
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:24,520
What do your parents call you?

911
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:26,680
Laxmi. What do your parents call you?

912
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:36,600
When I'm close,
they call out my name slowly...

913
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:41,560
...when I'm far, they call out loudly.

914
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:43,440
I like it.

915
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:45,240
I love it.

916
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:48,920
Cheers.

917
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:52,480
Vidya, where are you?

918
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:54,240
- Buddy.
- Yes.

919
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:56,000
Has anyone seen me act in drama?

920
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:57,960
You've never acted in drama.

921
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,240
It was S. Satish.

922
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:03,440
I think he was standing beside
his juniors in the college. Right?

923
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:06,640
- I'm not talking about his drama.
- Then?

924
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:07,920
I'm talking about his drama.

925
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:10,040
Similar situation.

926
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:15,160
It is killing the person sitting
in the front with the bottle.

927
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:18,400
- Have you seen that?
- No.

928
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:19,960
- Deva.
- Tell me.

929
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,240
He always calls out Vidya's name...

930
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:24,920
...my BP shoots up...

931
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:30,120
...and then I will break
his head with the bottle...

932
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:31,360
...I will kill him.

933
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:35,160
- I already died when Vidya ditched me.
- My God.

934
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:36,680
I only alive--

935
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:40,600
If you talk about Vidya again,
I will kill you.

936
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:47,720
You're beautiful, wonderful!

937
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:51,440
Dev, you will become
a wonderful director.

938
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:54,600
Every film you make
will surely be a hit.

939
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:58,880
The producers will come after you.

940
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:02,080
You are a star director.

941
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:07,240
I don't want star. I just want
to become a good director. That's all.

942
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:12,760
Buddy, you're lucky, that's
why two girls are in love with you.

943
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:13,400
Right.

944
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:16,880
One of them pleads you
to fall in love with her.

945
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:18,840
She is still studying.

946
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:23,080
I see.

947
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:24,160
What about Pavi?

948
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:27,160
What about Pavitra?

949
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:29,520
She can't do anything without you...

950
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:32,160
...and you can't stay without her.

951
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:32,880
Point.

952
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:37,560
Deva, the moon can be on
a holiday on the no moon day.

953
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:42,840
But have you ever stopped
messaging Pavi even for a day?

954
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:44,960
Tell me.

955
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,400
Point no.2.

956
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:50,760
When her body temperature is high,
you call ill. Why?

957
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:52,640
I used to experience the same thing.

958
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:54,880
It is love.

959
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:02,400
It is friendship.
That's why I care about her so much.

960
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:11,840
Buddy, care, concern, commitment,
quarrel, anger, forgiveness...

961
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:17,000
...all put together is love.

962
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:17,800
Correct.

963
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,400
Look, you don't confess
that you are in love with Pavi.

964
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:23,600
But at least confess
that you are in love.

965
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:26,240
You love her without your own knowledge.

966
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:30,680
You mean, it's love?

967
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:32,000
100 percent.

968
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:37,760
So, I am in love with Pavi?

969
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:39,680
200 percent.

970
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:42,400
So, even Pavi is in love with me?

971
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:44,480
300 percent.

972
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:45,800
Yes.

973
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:53,720
As you guys say,
even I think I'm in love with Pavi.

974
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:56,360
You finally confessed.

975
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:00,280
You think I will say like that? No.

976
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:05,240
Even if you see a brother and a sister
going on bike, you say they are lovers.

977
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:09,800
You don't know the difference
between love and friendship.

978
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:14,920
Love isn't blind.

979
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:18,880
Your mind that looks with
bad intention towards love is blind.

980
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:29,320
I had no such feeling towards Pavi.

981
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:34,320
We are good friends
and continue to be the same.

982
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:40,960
Look, if any of you become sober
by what I said, please have another peg.

983
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:44,800
I'm very sorry.
Have one more peg. Good night.

984
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:46,240
This is for you.

985
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:50,760
Nobody understands love.

986
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:54,320
Even love doesn't understand anybody.

987
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:57,640
Hey, shut up and drink.

988
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:06,040
Hey, stop ringing the bell.

989
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:11,400
What's the hurry? What happened?

990
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:15,720
Why? I'm talking to you.
Won't you answer me?

991
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:18,040
Father, allow me to be in peace.

992
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:24,640
Peace? We are lenient towards
you so that you live in peace.

993
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:26,400
It is you who has ruined peace.

994
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:27,840
Father.

995
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:30,680
What happened?

996
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,440
How would I know?

997
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:33,800
Alright. I will ask her.

998
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:35,320
She won't say anything.

999
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:37,280
Let's talk in the morning.

1000
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:44,480
Darn it.

1001
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:50,600
'Even I think I'm in love with Pavi.'

1002
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:08,480
'You have called is currently busy.'

1003
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:42,240
'The number you have dialed is
not responding at the moment.'

1004
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:43,600
'Kindly try again later.'

1005
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:51,880
Hello.

1006
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:54,480
Hello, aunt. Dev here.

1007
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:55,960
Where is Pavi?

1008
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,080
I don't know what happened.

1009
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:58,960
She was angry when
she was returned home.

1010
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,640
Her father tried to talk to her,
but she didn't talk to him.

1011
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:02,560
Did you two quarrel?

1012
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:04,600
No, aunt. I didn't meet her today.

1013
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:06,440
- What has happened to her?
- I don't know.

1014
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:09,880
She didn't have dinner too.
She is sleeping in the room.

1015
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:11,400
Okay. I will come there.

1016
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:12,680
Okay, come fast.

1017
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:41,480
Dev, come and see her.
She's not talking to us.

1018
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:42,640
I don't know who she is upset with.

1019
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:44,240
- I will talk to her, aunt.
- Come.

1020
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:21,160
Pavi.

1021
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:23,480
Pavi.

1022
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:30,920
I heard you are upset.
I heard you didn't have dinner too.

1023
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:32,320
What happened?

1024
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:44,240
You said you are going out,
did anything happen there?

1025
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:51,240
Since your silent,
even your phone is in silent mode.

1026
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:54,760
Did your parents...?

1027
00:59:57,480 --> 00:59:59,120
I guess you are angry with me.

1028
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:01,760
What did I do?

1029
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:06,200
Pavi, I'm talking to you and--

1030
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:09,320
Pavi, I'm sorry if I have erred.

1031
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:11,360
- Pavi, listen to me.
- Don't touch me.

1032
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:12,720
Pavi, listen to me.

1033
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:14,040
Pavi.

1034
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:18,320
Pavi, you have the
right to get angry on me...

1035
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:19,880
...but tell me the reason.

1036
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:30,840
Pavi, why are you being so stubborn?

1037
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:34,640
Pavi, listen to me.

1038
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:39,080
I will be able to understand
only if you tell me what happened.

1039
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:40,600
Leave me.

1040
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:50,720
Pavi. There is limit to be patient too.

1041
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:52,880
If there is any problem, tell me.

1042
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:54,160
Let's find a solution.

1043
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:55,520
If you behave like this...

1044
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:58,120
I don't want you or your friendship.

1045
01:00:58,440 --> 01:01:01,360
I don't even want to talk to you.
Get out.

1046
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:06,680
Alright. I am angrier than you.

1047
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:10,200
I won't talk to you
until you talk to me.

1048
01:01:50,360 --> 01:01:52,920
 "Don't forget."

1049
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:55,920
 "Don't forget my friendship."

1050
01:01:56,520 --> 01:02:01,760
 "Don't stay without me."

1051
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:07,560
 "When you are cheated in love,
only your heart is hurt."

1052
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:14,080
 "But when friendship is spoilt,
the entire life is ruined."

1053
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:17,160
 "Don't forget."

1054
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:19,880
 "Don't forget my friendship."

1055
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:07,360
 "If you go away from
me without talking...

1056
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:13,560
 ...how can I live in pain?"

1057
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:19,400
 "Though we unite,
there will be differences."

1058
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:25,720
 "Why don't you understand me?"

1059
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:31,480
 "Our friendship is pure than breeze."

1060
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:36,160
 "Please smile at least now."

1061
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:40,400
 "You are my life."

1062
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:44,200
 "How can I live without you?"

1063
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:46,800
 "Don't forget."

1064
01:03:47,080 --> 01:03:52,960
 "Don't forget my friendship."

1065
01:04:11,960 --> 01:04:14,840
Pavi has not been talking to
me for the last three months, father.

1066
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:16,360
I don't know the reason.

1067
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:18,000
It is very painful, father.

1068
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:27,120
Sorry, guys.

1069
01:04:27,160 --> 01:04:38,680
 "Without you,
I don't even want to breathe the air."

1070
01:04:39,080 --> 01:04:51,000
 "I think a friend like you
was born just for me, believe me."

1071
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:56,760
 "I wonder why I lost your friendship."

1072
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:01,640
 "Finally, my heart broke into pieces."

1073
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:09,040
 "I cry thinking about you."

1074
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:12,480
 "Don't forget."

1075
01:05:56,200 --> 01:05:57,280
Pavi?

1076
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:34,440
Darn it.

1077
01:06:59,240 --> 01:07:00,080
Excuse me.

1078
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:06,240
Pavi.

1079
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:10,440
Why did you come here?

1080
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:14,960
Tell me. Why are you
looking at me like that?

1081
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:16,960
Pavi, I--

1082
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:20,360
Your intentions are bad.
Why did you come here?

1083
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:21,800
Pavi, I--

1084
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:24,200
Don't talk. I'm not talking to you.

1085
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:25,960
Then why have you come here?

1086
01:07:26,360 --> 01:07:27,880
- Pavi, please listen to me--
- Hey!

1087
01:07:28,520 --> 01:07:30,000
Your intentions are bad.

1088
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:32,720
Intentions?
Pavi, between you and me--

1089
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:36,320
Look, don't ruin my career
by talking about us here.

1090
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:41,280
Nobody here knows that
we divorced each other.

1091
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:44,560
Pavi, I--

1092
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:45,880
Get lost.

1093
01:08:12,080 --> 01:08:14,800
Do you now know why he
didn't accept your proposal?

1094
01:08:15,320 --> 01:08:16,520
I can't believe this.

1095
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:18,240
I can't believe this.

1096
01:08:18,680 --> 01:08:20,760
Friendship can turn into love...

1097
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:22,720
...but how can love
turn into friendship?

1098
01:08:23,680 --> 01:08:27,760
Lacchu, love came to an end
even before he could fall in love.

1099
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:32,360
He couldn't get Pavitra through love,
but he got her through friendship.

1100
01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:36,840
That's why he says friendship
is greater than love.

1101
01:08:38,320 --> 01:08:42,480
But why did they divorce each
other when they like each other so much?

1102
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:45,600
Hey, you are his childhood friend,
right? Please tell me everything.

1103
01:08:46,920 --> 01:08:54,480
There are some things by which you feel
the pain even when you hear about it.

1104
01:08:56,520 --> 01:08:57,480
Alright, go.

1105
01:08:57,520 --> 01:09:00,640
Please, Nani. You told me
so many things. Tell me even this.

1106
01:09:00,920 --> 01:09:03,320
I'm not asking you just
because I want to hurt someone.

1107
01:09:03,360 --> 01:09:05,280
I loved Dev so much.

1108
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:07,760
I want to know what happened.
Please.

1109
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:09,800
Alright.

1110
01:09:10,040 --> 01:09:14,520
Dev shouldn't know that
I have told you everything.

1111
01:09:17,840 --> 01:09:21,120
God, by your grace there
was ample rainfall...

1112
01:09:21,480 --> 01:09:26,600
...and there has been good harvest.

1113
01:09:27,320 --> 01:09:30,960
Our farmers are so happy.

1114
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:38,000
Bless the villagers that
they live happily and peacefully.

1115
01:09:38,440 --> 01:09:39,880
Bless us.

1116
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:43,640
- Father.
- Yes.

1117
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:45,000
Everyone is waiting outside.

1118
01:09:46,120 --> 01:09:47,880
- Also ask your sister to come.
- Okay.

1119
01:09:48,720 --> 01:09:49,400
Hurry up.

1120
01:09:49,440 --> 01:09:50,240
Has all the sacks been delivered?

1121
01:09:50,280 --> 01:09:51,640
- Greetings, sir.
- Greetings.

1122
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:53,440
- How are you?
- Fine.

1123
01:09:54,040 --> 01:09:54,960
Where are the rest of them?

1124
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:56,240
- They are coming.
- They are coming?

1125
01:09:56,280 --> 01:09:57,200
- Yes.
- Okay.

1126
01:09:57,240 --> 01:09:58,240
Why did you summon us, sir?

1127
01:09:58,520 --> 01:09:59,840
What are you asking?

1128
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:03,120
When there is new harvest...

1129
01:10:03,160 --> 01:10:05,480
...it is the tradition of our ancestors
to distribute it.

1130
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:07,520
You have already done a lot for us.

1131
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:09,400
You look after us like your children.

1132
01:10:09,680 --> 01:10:11,040
What else could we ask for, sir?

1133
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:16,360
Only because you people toiled hard,
I've been able to make so much money.

1134
01:10:16,760 --> 01:10:21,280
God has given me money just
to distribute to people like you.

1135
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:23,720
God bless you, sir.

1136
01:10:23,960 --> 01:10:27,120
Dear, please come and
distribute it to everyone. Come.

1137
01:10:30,160 --> 01:10:31,600
Pick it up. Slowly.

1138
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:34,480
- Come. Take it.
- Come. Take it.

1139
01:10:45,720 --> 01:10:47,280
Didn't you give him pill before food?

1140
01:10:47,320 --> 01:10:48,320
I did give him.

1141
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:53,680
I've only been eating millet
balls and pills for the last one month.

1142
01:10:53,720 --> 01:10:55,720
Please give me rice at least today.

1143
01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:59,080
As per the doctor's advice, you
cannot have rice for another two months.

1144
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:04,160
My God. He doesn't want me to have rice.
I give rice even to him every month.

1145
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:05,120
Do one thing.

1146
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:08,520
I will be in the bungalow
tomorrow morning. Ask him to meet me.

1147
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:10,960
He won't come.

1148
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:13,840
He is scared if the
elephant will stamp him.

1149
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:17,240
Not just stamp him,
I will have him smashed.

1150
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:24,080
- How is the food?
- Tasty.

1151
01:11:24,120 --> 01:11:24,920
Darn it.

1152
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:29,000
What has happened to her?

1153
01:11:30,040 --> 01:11:31,240
- Father-in-law.
- Yes.

1154
01:11:31,720 --> 01:11:33,560
My daughter looks upset today.

1155
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:36,240
Your daughter is angry.

1156
01:11:36,280 --> 01:11:40,160
Our village Goddess
Mariyamma has loomed on her.

1157
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:43,760
I will talk to her,
pacify her and bring her. Have food.

1158
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:47,280
What is it, dear?

1159
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:49,920
What happened?

1160
01:11:55,560 --> 01:11:59,320
She looks so beautiful even in anger.

1161
01:12:00,240 --> 01:12:02,560
I hope you are not angry with me.

1162
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:07,280
Tell me what happened, dear?

1163
01:12:08,160 --> 01:12:10,680
Will you punish the one who
commits mistake in this village?

1164
01:12:10,720 --> 01:12:12,160
Of course.

1165
01:12:12,200 --> 01:12:15,080
Will you spare the one who
tarnished the dignity of this family?

1166
01:12:15,320 --> 01:12:19,320
The person who does that,
I will hack him to pieces.

1167
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:22,080
- Grandpa.
- Yes.

1168
01:12:22,120 --> 01:12:23,320
Do you know what happened?

1169
01:12:23,680 --> 01:12:24,920
- Come.
- Leave me.

1170
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:26,160
- We are getting late to school.
- Leave me.

1171
01:12:26,200 --> 01:12:27,520
- Please come.
- I won't come.

1172
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:29,240
The watchman will complain. Come.

1173
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:31,520
- I don't care. Leave me.
- Come.

1174
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:36,200
If you don't come with me now,
you will die for real.

1175
01:12:36,240 --> 01:12:37,720
I don't care.

1176
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:42,120
I want to whistle for fights,
clap for the climax...

1177
01:12:43,160 --> 01:12:46,840
...and memorize the dialogue
and only then come to school.

1178
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:47,720
Is that all?

1179
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:50,360
That's all.

1180
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:51,320
My geometry box.

1181
01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:58,720
Yes. It is your geometry box,
but I need money to watch the film.

1182
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:00,600
I will complain to grandpa.

1183
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:01,640
Go ahead.

1184
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:04,200
Good boy.

1185
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:06,760
I'm always a good boy.

1186
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:14,320
Sir, what time is the show?

1187
01:13:14,360 --> 01:13:15,200
The show has already started.

1188
01:13:15,240 --> 01:13:16,760
- Really?
- Yes.

1189
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:24,640
I won't spare him today.

1190
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:28,040
He is getting spoilt day by day.

1191
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:29,360
Correct.

1192
01:13:29,680 --> 01:13:31,040
Are you happy now?

1193
01:13:31,080 --> 01:13:35,040
No. He must come and grandpa must
beat him, only then I will be happy.

1194
01:13:35,080 --> 01:13:37,480
- Look--
- I won't spare him today.

1195
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:39,000
I will beat him.

1196
01:13:42,240 --> 01:13:43,080
Go.

1197
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:46,080
Grandpa, he's here.

1198
01:13:46,120 --> 01:13:48,760
Catch him. Don't let him go.

1199
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:49,920
- Stop.
- Don't let him go.

1200
01:13:49,960 --> 01:13:51,840
- Leave me!
- Don't let go!

1201
01:13:51,880 --> 01:13:52,760
You are finished.

1202
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:55,160
You've come to high school and...

1203
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:57,040
...you already started going
for movies bunking school?

1204
01:13:57,080 --> 01:13:58,400
Now, you are passionate about movies...

1205
01:13:58,440 --> 01:13:59,840
...later, you will be
passionate about pancakes.

1206
01:13:59,880 --> 01:14:00,680
I won't spare you today.

1207
01:14:00,720 --> 01:14:01,360
Correct, grandpa.

1208
01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:02,840
Grandpa, I'm sorry.

1209
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:04,000
I will go with her
to school from tomorrow.

1210
01:14:04,040 --> 01:14:04,400
Don't trust him.

1211
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:06,680
I know how to make you see sense.
Go inside.

1212
01:14:06,720 --> 01:14:09,440
- Grandpa, sorry. Please leave me.
- Don't spare him.

1213
01:14:09,480 --> 01:14:11,080
I won't spare you!

1214
01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:12,160
Father, no.

1215
01:14:12,200 --> 01:14:13,920
Grandpa, don't beat me. Please don't.

1216
01:14:14,160 --> 01:14:15,600
- Grandpa.
- What do you think of yourself?

1217
01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:20,400
- How dare you steal money?
- Grandpa, she is lying.

1218
01:14:20,440 --> 01:14:23,400
Brother-in-law, don't be surprised.
It happens every day.

1219
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:24,520
How dare you steal money?

1220
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:26,720
- Come and sit.
- How dare you steal money?

1221
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:29,040
Are you happy now?

1222
01:14:29,560 --> 01:14:31,560
I'm feeling a little happy.

1223
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:34,760
But I want to see it for once.

1224
01:14:35,880 --> 01:14:38,200
Will you steal her money again?

1225
01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:39,800
Grandpa, it's hurting.

1226
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:41,600
I've been pampering you a lot.

1227
01:14:41,960 --> 01:14:43,920
- Scream.
- Grandpa!

1228
01:14:43,960 --> 01:14:45,240
- How dare you...?
- Grandpa!

1229
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:48,480
Grandpa, that's cheating.

1230
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:54,640
- What do we do now?
- Go. She found out.

1231
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:55,920
What happened?

1232
01:14:55,960 --> 01:14:57,560
Grandpa, what's this?

1233
01:14:58,040 --> 01:15:01,000
Drama. We were just pretending.
How can I beat you both?

1234
01:15:01,040 --> 01:15:03,480
I can never beat you.

1235
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:07,120
You both are like the apple of my eyes.

1236
01:15:07,160 --> 01:15:09,320
Even if one of you is hurt,
I can't tolerate.

1237
01:15:11,560 --> 01:15:12,800
Feed her.

1238
01:15:13,240 --> 01:15:14,240
- Feed her.
- Okay.

1239
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:15,200
Feed her.

1240
01:15:15,240 --> 01:15:15,840
Have it.

1241
01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:16,960
- Have it.
- Have it.

1242
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:18,200
Have it.

1243
01:15:18,240 --> 01:15:18,760
Feed her.

1244
01:15:22,240 --> 01:15:23,520
Come, let's have food.

1245
01:15:33,960 --> 01:15:34,760
'Dimaak'.

1246
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:36,080
I will watch it today itself.

1247
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:42,240
Grandpa, I'm getting
late to college. Stop it.

1248
01:15:42,280 --> 01:15:43,000
Where are you taking me?

1249
01:15:43,040 --> 01:15:44,640
I want to show you something.

1250
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:46,320
- Father--
- I know very well.

1251
01:15:46,360 --> 01:15:48,080
You must've bought a new sari for Pavi.

1252
01:15:48,120 --> 01:15:49,520
You are wrong.

1253
01:15:49,560 --> 01:15:50,840
Open your eyes.

1254
01:15:52,040 --> 01:15:54,160
New bike? For whom?

1255
01:15:54,200 --> 01:15:56,800
Chennabasappa has become old...

1256
01:15:56,840 --> 01:15:59,640
...hence I bought
him a bike from foreign.

1257
01:16:00,160 --> 01:16:01,680
You are so silly.

1258
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,880
Do I have 10 grandsons?

1259
01:16:04,120 --> 01:16:06,440
You are my only grandson.

1260
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:08,320
Your happiness is mine.

1261
01:16:08,360 --> 01:16:09,200
Here.

1262
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:12,600
- Grand, bless me.
- Be happy.

1263
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:14,920
- Shall I go to college in bike?
- Go ahead.

1264
01:16:14,960 --> 01:16:15,720
Then will you go by cart?

1265
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:16,720
- Father.
- Go.

1266
01:16:16,760 --> 01:16:18,520
- Go.
- Go slowly.

1267
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:20,040
- Go slowly.
- Okay.

1268
01:16:22,120 --> 01:16:22,600
Bye.

1269
01:16:22,640 --> 01:16:23,320
Bye.

1270
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:26,560
Enjoy yourself! Bye!

1271
01:16:27,720 --> 01:16:29,240
'Nanu Nanna Kanasu (dream).'

1272
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:31,640
My dream is cinema.

1273
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,600
Let me see what the
dream in this film is.

1274
01:16:35,920 --> 01:16:37,160
- Krishnappa.
- Yes.

1275
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:39,000
Your daughters have grown up.

1276
01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:43,880
Instead of getting them married off,
why are you spending all your money?

1277
01:16:44,280 --> 01:16:50,360
Request the government
to provide you with land.

1278
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:52,680
- I will announce in the village council--
- Grandpa, I'm going to college.

1279
01:16:52,720 --> 01:16:54,200
Grandpa, I'm going to college.
Bless me first.

1280
01:16:54,720 --> 01:16:56,680
Science always first, Arts next. Okay?

1281
01:16:56,720 --> 01:16:59,120
Is an omniscient great or a scientist?

1282
01:16:59,160 --> 01:17:00,440
Both are not great.

1283
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:02,280
We are great. Illiterates.

1284
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:03,040
How?

1285
01:17:03,080 --> 01:17:07,880
We use the things discovered by you.

1286
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:11,240
You are great, grandpa. Learn from him.

1287
01:17:12,280 --> 01:17:13,000
- Bye, grandpa.
- Bye, grandpa.

1288
01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:14,080
Bye.

1289
01:17:14,360 --> 01:17:15,440
Don't quarrel.

1290
01:17:15,480 --> 01:17:16,920
- Go to the college happily.
- Okay, grandpa.

1291
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:17,840
Okay, grandpa.

1292
01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:22,560
You love your
grandchildren so much, sir.

1293
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:24,440
I don't want anything else, Krishnappa.

1294
01:17:24,680 --> 01:17:26,480
They are my world.

1295
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:29,000
They are like the apple of my eyes.

1296
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:30,920
Even if one eyes is hurt,
I become blind.

1297
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:31,920
That's right, sir.

1298
01:17:31,960 --> 01:17:35,400
Lord Mahadesha has granted
us happiness till now...

1299
01:17:36,160 --> 01:17:39,880
...if He continues to do so,
I will be very happy.

1300
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:43,000
Sir.

1301
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:45,240
Why? What happened?

1302
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:48,320
My chest is aching.

1303
01:17:48,680 --> 01:17:49,520
Ma'am.

1304
01:17:57,720 --> 01:17:59,840
Sir, you are perfect alright.

1305
01:18:00,280 --> 01:18:02,960
I will prescribe some medicines,
have them. Don't worry.

1306
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:04,840
It's very common when you become old.

1307
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:07,480
- Just pills, doctor?
- That's enough.

1308
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:10,560
- Give him these medicines regularly.
- Okay.

1309
01:18:11,200 --> 01:18:12,360
I will visit again.

1310
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:18,000
Don't panic after hearing me what I say.

1311
01:18:19,560 --> 01:18:21,440
Your father had a mild heart attack.

1312
01:18:22,440 --> 01:18:23,400
Doctor?

1313
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:24,440
Don't worry.

1314
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:27,000
Take good care of him.

1315
01:18:27,480 --> 01:18:28,720
Give him these medicines regularly.

1316
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:30,360
I will check him often.

1317
01:18:31,400 --> 01:18:32,920
Doctors don't know anything.

1318
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:36,760
Won't I know the condition of my health?

1319
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:38,120
- What are you saying, father?
- Father-in-law.

1320
01:18:40,360 --> 01:18:41,560
Don't delay anymore.

1321
01:18:43,560 --> 01:18:45,960
Please fulfil my last wish.

1322
01:18:47,240 --> 01:18:48,680
- Last wish?
- What is it?

1323
01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:55,160
I want to see my grandchildren
getting married before I die.

1324
01:19:01,320 --> 01:19:03,720
Why? Why did you fall silent?

1325
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:05,160
No.

1326
01:19:05,200 --> 01:19:07,920
I beg of you.
Please fulfil my last wish.

1327
01:19:07,960 --> 01:19:09,040
- No, father.
- That's enough.

1328
01:19:10,160 --> 01:19:11,960
Okay, father-in-law.
We will do as you say.

1329
01:19:14,240 --> 01:19:16,240
I don't want to get married now.

1330
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:19,800
I've been having several
dreams since my childhood.

1331
01:19:20,680 --> 01:19:23,400
I will go and tell
grandpa about my dreams.

1332
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:26,680
Your grandpa has told
us about his last wish.

1333
01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:29,880
You can add another
dream to your dreams...

1334
01:19:30,160 --> 01:19:32,000
...but for your grandpa,
it is his last wish.

1335
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:34,880
If you don't get married,
your grandpa will die.

1336
01:19:34,920 --> 01:19:37,240
If I get married,
will he live for thousand years?

1337
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:39,880
Pavi, you are talking too much.

1338
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:42,840
If not today,
I will never be able to talk.

1339
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:44,400
Grandpa brings justice to people...

1340
01:19:44,440 --> 01:19:46,200
...but he's doing injustice
with his granddaughter.

1341
01:19:47,280 --> 01:19:49,400
Being a mother, won't you think?

1342
01:19:49,440 --> 01:19:52,320
We know better than you
how your life should be, Pavi.

1343
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:53,840
Mother--

1344
01:19:53,880 --> 01:19:57,560
Look, I don't know whether
or not you need your grandpa...

1345
01:19:58,200 --> 01:19:59,960
...but I need my father.

1346
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:03,000
- I hope you need your mother.
- Mother.

1347
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:10,280
Look, I'm here to convey our decision...

1348
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:12,880
...and not to know your opinion.

1349
01:20:25,400 --> 01:20:27,640
Pavi, why are you sitting like this?

1350
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:32,200
Relatives have come home,
they are asking for the bride.

1351
01:20:32,240 --> 01:20:33,240
But you--

1352
01:20:33,480 --> 01:20:38,080
- Mother, that's not so. I--
- Look, I know what you want to say.

1353
01:20:39,040 --> 01:20:41,200
One has to repay for the favours.

1354
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:43,680
You have to protect
your grandpa's dignity.

1355
01:20:44,040 --> 01:20:46,520
Stop crying. Get ready fast and come.

1356
01:20:47,800 --> 01:20:48,920
You are a good girl.

1357
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:37,480
 "The drums are being played loudly."

1358
01:21:37,720 --> 01:21:43,040
 "The auspicious period is nearing,
get on the dais."

1359
01:21:43,080 --> 01:21:46,680
 "Bathing with turmeric."

1360
01:21:46,720 --> 01:21:50,880
 "You're so beautiful."

1361
01:21:51,240 --> 01:21:55,240
 "It is my daughter's marriage."

1362
01:21:55,280 --> 01:21:58,760
 "Marriage procession."

1363
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:02,640
 "Fate written by Lord Brahma."

1364
01:22:06,920 --> 01:22:10,440
 "Two hearts are meeting."

1365
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:14,480
 "It is the growth of the clan."

1366
01:22:18,680 --> 01:22:26,480
 "The drums are being played loudly."

1367
01:22:26,520 --> 01:22:30,280
 "The auspicious period is nearing,
get on the dais."

1368
01:23:05,840 --> 01:23:12,840
 "I drop grains on your head and bless
you to live happily all your life."

1369
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:14,840
 "Don't worry."

1370
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:18,520
 - "Let there be happiness.
- In your life."

1371
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:23,200
 - "Let there be love.
- In your life."

1372
01:23:23,240 --> 01:23:27,000
 "Take the seven holy rounds
and tie the nuptial chain."

1373
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:30,880
 "Touch the nuptial
chain and make promises."

1374
01:23:30,920 --> 01:23:34,760
 "Get on the cart and travel."

1375
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:38,720
 "May you both live
a happy married life."

1376
01:23:38,760 --> 01:23:42,640
 "Let's decorate the dais..."

1377
01:23:42,680 --> 01:23:46,440
 "...for the beautiful couple."

1378
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:27,160
 "Our house is like a garden and
you remain as married woman forever."

1379
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:31,280
 "There are mantras, there are chants."

1380
01:24:31,320 --> 01:24:35,160
 "There is happiness in our tears."

1381
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:39,120
 "You will always have our blessings."

1382
01:24:39,400 --> 01:24:43,000
 "Our hearts are like a temple."

1383
01:24:43,360 --> 01:24:46,960
 "Promises are made in heaven."

1384
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:50,920
 "Patience is like God."

1385
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:58,320
 "Beautiful wedding
dais and delicious feasts."

1386
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:10,280
 "God bless this newly wedded couple."

1387
01:25:46,440 --> 01:25:49,120
Go inside, dear. Don't feel shy.

1388
01:25:49,360 --> 01:25:50,960
Don't feel shy. Go.

1389
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:13,880
Pavi, what are you doing?

1390
01:26:14,320 --> 01:26:15,880
This is for you to sleep.

1391
01:26:16,120 --> 01:26:18,160
For me? Why?

1392
01:26:19,120 --> 01:26:21,360
You can't? I will sleep.

1393
01:26:21,400 --> 01:26:24,240
Pavi, what's going on?

1394
01:26:24,760 --> 01:26:28,640
I thought you will
come and offer me milk.

1395
01:26:29,080 --> 01:26:31,840
You don't deserve it.

1396
01:26:33,480 --> 01:26:34,800
Pavi, what have I done?

1397
01:26:36,840 --> 01:26:39,920
Pavi, your eyes are red. Did you cry?

1398
01:26:41,160 --> 01:26:43,200
You see my eyes crying...

1399
01:26:43,640 --> 01:26:45,520
...don't you see my
desires getting ruined?

1400
01:26:46,200 --> 01:26:48,520
Don't you see my dreams
getting shattered?

1401
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:51,480
Pavi, dreams don't get shattered.

1402
01:26:52,200 --> 01:26:54,840
I'm with you. I will support you.

1403
01:26:54,880 --> 01:26:56,400
Who are you to support me?

1404
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:01,800
First of all,
do you know what my dreams are?

1405
01:27:04,120 --> 01:27:06,440
I wanted to go to
Bangalore and do masters...

1406
01:27:07,760 --> 01:27:09,240
...I wanted to go to foreign...

1407
01:27:12,160 --> 01:27:14,560
...I wanted to achieve something
by which people feel proud of me.

1408
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:15,920
Is that all?

1409
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:18,360
You can still pursue your dreams, Pavi.

1410
01:27:21,560 --> 01:27:23,120
How will I be able to do it...

1411
01:27:23,840 --> 01:27:25,280
...if I'm rendering my service
to you in this house?

1412
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:28,800
Once a girl gets married, it's
impossible for her to achieve anything.

1413
01:27:30,440 --> 01:27:33,240
Look, Pavi, everyone has dreams.

1414
01:27:34,440 --> 01:27:38,680
Things that we don't want to do,
God makes us do it on purpose.

1415
01:27:39,800 --> 01:27:43,680
You can always change your mind, Pavi.

1416
01:27:45,080 --> 01:27:48,880
Did you watch any
film before marrying me?

1417
01:27:50,040 --> 01:27:51,480
This dialogue is from which movie?

1418
01:27:52,520 --> 01:27:54,840
I don't like this marriage.

1419
01:27:56,080 --> 01:27:56,600
Why?

1420
01:27:56,640 --> 01:27:59,000
Because I don't like you.

1421
01:27:59,840 --> 01:28:02,640
Yes. I don't like you.

1422
01:28:03,240 --> 01:28:04,720
I don't like you.

1423
01:28:09,960 --> 01:28:13,440
If this is the situation on
the very first night, what about--

1424
01:28:13,480 --> 01:28:15,680
- Pavi--
- What about the future?

1425
01:28:15,720 --> 01:28:20,040
Look, please don't scream.
Everyone will hear you.

1426
01:28:20,560 --> 01:28:25,200
Alright, I won't scream.
I beg of you. Leave me.

1427
01:28:41,640 --> 01:28:46,320
Pavi, if you don't like me, I
won't touch you though you are my wife.

1428
01:28:47,680 --> 01:28:50,280
Even I'm a human being, not an animal.

1429
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:52,760
It was grandpa's wish.

1430
01:28:53,240 --> 01:28:55,640
I agreed for the marriage
thinking even you agreed, Pavi.

1431
01:28:56,640 --> 01:28:58,680
Otherwise, I wouldn't have agreed.

1432
01:29:04,080 --> 01:29:05,200
Sorry.

1433
01:29:07,520 --> 01:29:08,680
Don't be sorry.

1434
01:29:10,320 --> 01:29:14,320
You stamped whether it is knowingly
or unknowingly, it is the ant that dies.

1435
01:29:15,280 --> 01:29:20,320
Had you told me that you don't
want to get married, I would've agreed.

1436
01:29:22,280 --> 01:29:26,760
But you said you don't like me.
That's hurting me.

1437
01:29:27,200 --> 01:29:27,960
Never mind.

1438
01:29:28,280 --> 01:29:31,640
To live happily together,
there is no need for registration, Pavi.

1439
01:29:32,280 --> 01:29:35,800
But to live the way you want,
divorce is necessary.

1440
01:29:36,680 --> 01:29:37,840
I will do something.

1441
01:29:40,160 --> 01:29:41,280
Thanks, Dev.

1442
01:29:42,160 --> 01:29:47,400
But remember. No one,
grandpa, no one should know about it.

1443
01:29:48,720 --> 01:29:50,320
- Okay?
- Okay.

1444
01:29:50,360 --> 01:29:51,440
One more condition.

1445
01:29:52,240 --> 01:29:56,480
You should forget all this
and be close to me like a friend again.

1446
01:29:57,840 --> 01:30:04,280
Only then I will be able to
support you in fulfilling your dreams.

1447
01:30:05,480 --> 01:30:07,240
Okay. Go and sleep.

1448
01:30:07,480 --> 01:30:10,160
Dev, I will sleep down.

1449
01:30:10,880 --> 01:30:12,480
Will you listen to me at least now?

1450
01:30:13,960 --> 01:30:15,000
Go.

1451
01:30:24,080 --> 01:30:25,080
Sleep.

1452
01:31:03,440 --> 01:31:05,680
Dev.

1453
01:31:06,840 --> 01:31:08,680
Will we surely get it today?

1454
01:31:09,960 --> 01:31:12,960
We have applied on mutual understanding,
we will surely get it.

1455
01:31:28,200 --> 01:31:29,040
Come.

1456
01:31:37,720 --> 01:31:40,720
Dev, so many people today?
They are here for divorce?

1457
01:31:40,760 --> 01:31:43,120
No. They are here for marriage feast.

1458
01:31:43,160 --> 01:31:44,720
Dev, stop joking.

1459
01:31:44,760 --> 01:31:46,480
Then why do people come to court?

1460
01:31:46,880 --> 01:31:48,560
Will so many people get
divorce at the same time?

1461
01:31:49,360 --> 01:31:53,760
Pavi, in our country there is
mass wedding, there is no mass divorce.

1462
01:31:55,640 --> 01:31:56,640
I don't have money.

1463
01:31:56,680 --> 01:31:58,480
Dev, will we get divorce for sure?

1464
01:31:58,520 --> 01:32:01,440
Of course. Don't worry. Sit.

1465
01:32:01,480 --> 01:32:03,960
If you don't give me money,
I won't divorce.

1466
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:05,440
- I said I can't.
- You can't refuse.

1467
01:32:05,480 --> 01:32:06,200
I can't give you money.

1468
01:32:06,240 --> 01:32:08,080
How will I raise our child?
I don't care.

1469
01:32:08,120 --> 01:32:10,400
I don't want you or your child. Go away.

1470
01:32:10,440 --> 01:32:12,640
Dev, why are they quarrelling?

1471
01:32:14,160 --> 01:32:17,720
They are actually here to quarrel.
Climax fight.

1472
01:32:18,080 --> 01:32:19,640
Climax fight?

1473
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:23,680
They can't quarrel after divorce.
Hence, it is their final quarrel.

1474
01:32:23,720 --> 01:32:27,200
Oh.
But we didn't quarrel?

1475
01:32:27,680 --> 01:32:31,680
- So you want us to quarrel? Come on.
- Yes.

1476
01:32:31,960 --> 01:32:32,720
- Come on.
- Fight.

1477
01:32:33,080 --> 01:32:34,280
- Come on.
- Fight.

1478
01:32:34,560 --> 01:32:35,920
Come on.

1479
01:32:36,400 --> 01:32:41,480
They will never stop fighting.
They have a daughter. How will they...?

1480
01:32:42,920 --> 01:32:44,480
What are you lovers doing in the court?

1481
01:32:44,520 --> 01:32:45,680
They look like husband and wife, sir.

1482
01:32:45,720 --> 01:32:48,400
May they live happily together forever.

1483
01:32:48,960 --> 01:32:50,120
No, no.

1484
01:32:53,280 --> 01:32:57,720
Your honour, my clients had
applied for divorce six months ago.

1485
01:32:58,160 --> 01:33:00,760
For the last six months...

1486
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:04,640
...all the efforts to unite on behalf
of the court went in vain.

1487
01:33:05,120 --> 01:33:09,640
Therefore, I request the
court to grant them divorce.

1488
01:33:11,800 --> 01:33:14,160
Dev!

1489
01:33:14,960 --> 01:33:17,880
Pavitra!

1490
01:33:18,400 --> 01:33:19,760
Mr. Dev, come here.

1491
01:33:21,440 --> 01:33:22,680
Stand here.

1492
01:33:25,080 --> 01:33:26,760
Pavi, fold your hands.

1493
01:33:35,080 --> 01:33:41,560
Did you both apply for
divorce on your own will?

1494
01:33:41,880 --> 01:33:43,160
Yes, your honour.

1495
01:33:46,920 --> 01:33:50,000
Whatever is mentioned in this paper,
do you agree it is true?

1496
01:33:50,400 --> 01:33:52,840
Yes.

1497
01:33:52,880 --> 01:33:53,960
Yes.

1498
01:33:57,320 --> 01:34:02,000
Do you have the courage
to face the society after divorce?

1499
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,440
What's there to be ashamed about it,
your honour?

1500
01:34:05,480 --> 01:34:07,160
The situation demands. That's it.

1501
01:34:07,840 --> 01:34:11,320
Dear, was it a love marriage
or arranged marriage?

1502
01:34:14,520 --> 01:34:15,640
Arranged marriage.

1503
01:34:15,680 --> 01:34:19,720
During the time of marriage, you get
married before your parents, siblings...

1504
01:34:19,960 --> 01:34:24,080
...hundred of friends
and relatives in grand pomp...

1505
01:34:24,400 --> 01:34:28,160
...but now,
you both have come alone for divorce.

1506
01:34:28,440 --> 01:34:30,080
You have no vision in life.

1507
01:34:31,240 --> 01:34:35,080
As you have applied for
divorce on your own will...

1508
01:34:35,640 --> 01:34:41,240
...it is clear for the court
that you're not doing it on compel...

1509
01:34:41,760 --> 01:34:45,240
...the court is accepting your divorce.

1510
01:34:52,680 --> 01:34:54,600
Pavi, sit in the car, I will come.

1511
01:34:54,640 --> 01:34:55,640
Okay.

1512
01:34:56,080 --> 01:34:57,120
Sir, just a minute.

1513
01:34:57,160 --> 01:34:57,520
Yes, Dev.

1514
01:34:57,560 --> 01:34:58,520
I have a small request.

1515
01:34:58,560 --> 01:34:59,080
Tell me.

1516
01:34:59,680 --> 01:35:02,200
Will you please send both
the divorce papers to my address?

1517
01:35:02,720 --> 01:35:03,680
Okay. I will send.

1518
01:35:03,720 --> 01:35:04,840
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

1519
01:35:04,880 --> 01:35:05,760
Okay.

1520
01:35:10,920 --> 01:35:14,520
Like this, they are still
friends even after divorce.

1521
01:35:15,400 --> 01:35:23,520
Dev who is sacrificing his life just
to fulfil her dreams is really great.

1522
01:35:23,960 --> 01:35:27,280
Is love towards him increasing?

1523
01:35:27,320 --> 01:35:29,200
No, I have developed
more respect for him.

1524
01:35:29,520 --> 01:35:31,640
They both have to unite again.

1525
01:35:31,920 --> 01:35:34,440
They should live life together.

1526
01:35:34,960 --> 01:35:37,520
Dear, whom do you want to unite?

1527
01:35:38,360 --> 01:35:44,120
Well...
You and Pavi should unite.

1528
01:35:48,960 --> 01:35:52,120
Look, I thought no
one should know about it.

1529
01:35:52,880 --> 01:35:54,880
Because it is about a girl's life.

1530
01:35:55,840 --> 01:35:58,440
But this idiot told you everything.

1531
01:35:59,040 --> 01:36:00,480
Forget about it right here.

1532
01:36:00,720 --> 01:36:01,800
Dev--

1533
01:36:03,080 --> 01:36:06,080
I don't want anyone interfering
in my personal life.

1534
01:36:06,480 --> 01:36:09,880
I may be a stranger to you,
but for me, you are not a stranger.

1535
01:36:10,480 --> 01:36:11,720
I will unite you both.

1536
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:19,280
The anger itself shows
how much you love her.

1537
01:36:20,080 --> 01:36:22,080
I will surely unite you both.

1538
01:36:25,960 --> 01:36:26,840
No.

1539
01:36:27,320 --> 01:36:28,760
Not again.

1540
01:36:43,360 --> 01:36:44,200
Tell me, buddy.

1541
01:36:44,240 --> 01:36:46,120
Dev, I have good news.

1542
01:36:46,160 --> 01:36:47,040
What is it?

1543
01:36:47,080 --> 01:36:49,440
There's interview going on
for analyser post in our office.

1544
01:36:49,800 --> 01:36:52,000
Those who get selected stand
a chance to go to Canada for training.

1545
01:36:52,040 --> 01:36:53,080
And guess what?

1546
01:36:53,360 --> 01:36:55,880
If you perform well, they
will also provide you with placement.

1547
01:36:55,920 --> 01:36:57,720
Ask Pavi to attend.

1548
01:36:58,240 --> 01:37:01,080
Buddy, help her to get selected.

1549
01:37:01,360 --> 01:37:02,720
Do you have to say it?

1550
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:10,600
'Don't come before
me or call and disturb me.'

1551
01:37:10,640 --> 01:37:12,120
But I have to inform her.

1552
01:37:22,240 --> 01:37:24,680
'The number you have called..'

1553
01:37:29,200 --> 01:37:32,000
Pavi, the phone is ringing, answer.

1554
01:37:33,240 --> 01:37:34,600
Okay, mother.

1555
01:37:39,240 --> 01:37:40,600
Hello, aunt. It's Dev.

1556
01:37:41,240 --> 01:37:42,320
Sorry, wrong number.

1557
01:37:43,720 --> 01:37:45,120
Who is it?

1558
01:37:45,960 --> 01:37:47,120
Wrong number, mother.

1559
01:38:05,560 --> 01:38:06,640
Aunt.

1560
01:38:07,360 --> 01:38:10,120
Come. It's been a long time seeing you.

1561
01:38:10,720 --> 01:38:13,840
Dev, did you remember us only today?

1562
01:38:14,680 --> 01:38:16,680
You are asking me despite
of knowing everything.

1563
01:38:17,520 --> 01:38:19,960
I called on the landline,
you said wrong number.

1564
01:38:20,680 --> 01:38:24,280
Oh. Let it be. Come, have coffee.

1565
01:38:24,320 --> 01:38:25,320
No, thanks.

1566
01:38:26,360 --> 01:38:29,520
Vishwa had called.
There is job opening in his company.

1567
01:38:30,080 --> 01:38:31,760
Please send Pavi, aunt.

1568
01:38:32,240 --> 01:38:33,640
Don't tell me.

1569
01:38:33,880 --> 01:38:36,040
She is upstairs.
Tell her and take her there.

1570
01:38:36,080 --> 01:38:36,840
Mother.

1571
01:38:37,160 --> 01:38:40,120
Mother, why do you ask
a stranger to talk to me?

1572
01:38:40,160 --> 01:38:43,480
This is my life.
I don't like anyone interfering.

1573
01:38:43,720 --> 01:38:44,600
Ask him to go.

1574
01:38:45,200 --> 01:38:48,600
Pavi, why are you talking like this?
Be quiet.

1575
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:50,760
- Dev--
- Never mind, aunt. I will leave.

1576
01:39:07,960 --> 01:39:08,960
According to the complaint of--

1577
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:10,240
- Excuse me, sir.
- Hello. Yes?

1578
01:39:10,920 --> 01:39:13,760
I told you about a candidate
named Pavirtra. It's her.

1579
01:39:14,280 --> 01:39:15,240
- Good afternoon, sir.
- Good afternoon.

1580
01:39:15,280 --> 01:39:15,880
Good afternoon.

1581
01:39:16,280 --> 01:39:17,240
My resume.

1582
01:39:17,280 --> 01:39:18,040
What is your name?

1583
01:39:18,080 --> 01:39:18,720
Pavitra.

1584
01:39:18,760 --> 01:39:19,320
Take your seat.

1585
01:39:19,360 --> 01:39:20,040
Thank you.

1586
01:39:43,920 --> 01:39:45,240
I have also comple--

1587
01:39:46,520 --> 01:39:48,040
- Sorry, sir. Excuse me.
- Yeah.

1588
01:39:51,640 --> 01:39:52,880
And--

1589
01:39:53,280 --> 01:39:55,480
- Yes.
- Buddy, it's me.

1590
01:39:55,720 --> 01:39:57,200
Did Pavi come? What happened?

1591
01:39:57,240 --> 01:39:58,640
She has come. The interview is on.

1592
01:39:58,680 --> 01:40:00,120
Call later. Okay? Bye.

1593
01:40:09,880 --> 01:40:11,920
Okay. You are shortlisted and--

1594
01:40:12,280 --> 01:40:13,440
- So, Vishwa.
- Sir.

1595
01:40:13,480 --> 01:40:15,360
No, you can arrange
the appointment letter.

1596
01:40:15,400 --> 01:40:16,120
Sure, sir.

1597
01:40:18,240 --> 01:40:20,040
Okay. Congrats.

1598
01:40:20,080 --> 01:40:21,520
- Thank you, sir.
- Good.

1599
01:40:21,920 --> 01:40:23,040
- Congrats.
- Thank you so much.

1600
01:40:23,400 --> 01:40:24,240
- All the best.
- Thank you.

1601
01:40:26,080 --> 01:40:28,320
Oh my God. My dream has come true.

1602
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:32,000
Thank you so much, Vishwa.
Thank you so much for this.

1603
01:40:32,040 --> 01:40:34,040
You need to thank Dev.

1604
01:40:35,760 --> 01:40:38,320
Don't talk about him to me.

1605
01:40:38,360 --> 01:40:39,240
Why?

1606
01:40:40,480 --> 01:40:43,280
He betrayed me in
the name of friendship.

1607
01:40:43,960 --> 01:40:45,720
And his intentions are also not right.

1608
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:47,000
Impossible.

1609
01:40:47,040 --> 01:40:50,840
His intentions are bad?
No chance. Who said so?

1610
01:40:50,880 --> 01:40:53,480
Why should anybody say?
I heard it myself.

1611
01:40:53,760 --> 01:40:55,280
Will you tell me what happened?

1612
01:40:56,440 --> 01:40:57,720
I will tell you.

1613
01:40:59,800 --> 01:41:04,160
'As you guys say,
even I think I'm in love with Pavi.'

1614
01:41:06,200 --> 01:41:09,040
In that case, you should
be proud to have a friend like him.

1615
01:41:09,400 --> 01:41:10,760
Why are you getting upset?

1616
01:41:11,320 --> 01:41:14,240
You only heard that much.

1617
01:41:14,560 --> 01:41:17,240
You didn't hear what
you should've heard.

1618
01:41:17,880 --> 01:41:20,360
'I have no such
intentions towards Pavi.'

1619
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:25,640
'We are good friends and
we will continue to be the same.'

1620
01:41:28,280 --> 01:41:31,480
Did you now know what place
he has given for you in his heart?

1621
01:41:32,160 --> 01:41:36,520
He is glad that he got you
through friendship if not through love.

1622
01:41:37,560 --> 01:41:41,040
Losing a friend like him, it
is you who will be under loss not him.

1623
01:41:45,640 --> 01:41:48,920
I want to meet him.
Where will he be?

1624
01:41:49,160 --> 01:41:52,960
He is at home. He had just
called to inquire about the interview.

1625
01:42:11,680 --> 01:42:13,000
Pavi?

1626
01:42:15,880 --> 01:42:17,160
Dev.

1627
01:42:19,800 --> 01:42:20,800
Pavi.

1628
01:42:23,320 --> 01:42:24,240
Pavi.

1629
01:42:26,280 --> 01:42:27,680
Pavi.

1630
01:42:27,720 --> 01:42:29,040
Don't cry.

1631
01:42:29,800 --> 01:42:30,720
Come on.

1632
01:42:31,360 --> 01:42:32,600
Listen to me, Pavi.

1633
01:42:33,400 --> 01:42:34,640
Look at me.

1634
01:42:35,200 --> 01:42:37,960
Pavi, don't cry.

1635
01:42:40,520 --> 01:42:43,800
Pavi, look at me. Come on.

1636
01:42:44,240 --> 01:42:47,720
Dev, sorry. I'm so sorry.

1637
01:42:49,280 --> 01:42:50,960
You don't have to apologize to me.

1638
01:42:51,400 --> 01:42:54,600
Never mind.
What about the interview?

1639
01:42:55,400 --> 01:42:58,920
Why do you get punished
for else's mistakes?

1640
01:42:59,640 --> 01:43:02,520
You need to ask those who punish me.

1641
01:43:03,240 --> 01:43:04,960
Let me tell you something, Pavi.

1642
01:43:05,520 --> 01:43:08,160
Never suspect those
who are closer to our heart.

1643
01:43:08,680 --> 01:43:11,520
And if you suspect,
never have that person in your life.

1644
01:43:11,560 --> 01:43:13,960
Sorry.
Are you still angry?

1645
01:43:15,680 --> 01:43:17,880
If you don't tell me about
the interview, I will get angry.

1646
01:43:19,760 --> 01:43:21,120
I've been selected.

1647
01:43:21,160 --> 01:43:24,400
Thank God.
I was tense since morning.

1648
01:43:24,800 --> 01:43:28,440
Very good.
Did you tell your parents about it?

1649
01:43:28,960 --> 01:43:30,800
Not yet. Give me your phone.

1650
01:43:31,080 --> 01:43:32,720
Does anyone give such
good news over the phone?

1651
01:43:33,280 --> 01:43:35,560
Go and tell them in person.
They will feel happy.

1652
01:43:36,440 --> 01:43:37,280
- Okay.
- Come.

1653
01:43:37,320 --> 01:43:38,400
Okay.

1654
01:43:39,800 --> 01:43:41,160
Dev, stop.

1655
01:43:41,200 --> 01:43:43,040
What is it? Are you done
with the second round of jogging?

1656
01:43:43,480 --> 01:43:45,240
Yes. I believe Pavi was here.

1657
01:43:45,280 --> 01:43:46,960
Yes. Everything is fine now.

1658
01:43:47,200 --> 01:43:48,360
Buddy, good news.

1659
01:43:48,400 --> 01:43:49,800
Pavi got the job.

1660
01:43:49,840 --> 01:43:52,080
She will go to Canada
as soon as the visa comes.

1661
01:43:52,400 --> 01:43:55,440
Even my girl got selected
for the state team.

1662
01:43:55,480 --> 01:43:56,640
- Really?
- Yes.

1663
01:43:57,800 --> 01:44:01,600
Poor girl.
I was very rude to her the other day.

1664
01:44:01,840 --> 01:44:03,880
- Where is she?
- She just went to the ground.

1665
01:44:03,920 --> 01:44:06,760
Okay. I will meet her later. Come.

1666
01:44:18,440 --> 01:44:20,560
You finally achieved. Very good.

1667
01:44:23,240 --> 01:44:24,520
- I will see you later.
- Okay. Bye.

1668
01:44:24,560 --> 01:44:25,280
Hi, Dev.

1669
01:44:27,520 --> 01:44:28,400
Dev.

1670
01:44:28,800 --> 01:44:29,760
Congratulations.

1671
01:44:29,800 --> 01:44:30,440
Thank you.

1672
01:44:30,480 --> 01:44:31,840
Hereafter, you need to focus more.

1673
01:44:32,200 --> 01:44:34,480
When you get an opportunity,
you must utilize it.

1674
01:44:35,080 --> 01:44:37,520
By the way,
does your coach still trouble you?

1675
01:44:37,560 --> 01:44:40,600
No, Dev. He couldn't know
that it was we who got him thrashed.

1676
01:44:41,720 --> 01:44:43,360
Talk softly. Somebody might hear you.

1677
01:44:43,400 --> 01:44:44,000
Oh, sorry.

1678
01:44:44,040 --> 01:44:45,920
Alright. You carry on.
I will see you later.

1679
01:44:45,960 --> 01:44:47,280
Okay. Bye.

1680
01:44:56,760 --> 01:44:59,800
So, it was you who got me thrashed.

1681
01:45:01,120 --> 01:45:02,280
How dare you?

1682
01:45:02,320 --> 01:45:04,120
Sir, it wasn't me.

1683
01:45:05,560 --> 01:45:08,160
I heard you talk to him.

1684
01:45:08,200 --> 01:45:12,520
No, sir. I was just watching. That's it.

1685
01:45:21,320 --> 01:45:24,200
All these days, I taught
you how to play game on the field.

1686
01:45:25,160 --> 01:45:29,040
For a change, I will teach you
how to play game in the dressing room.

1687
01:45:29,960 --> 01:45:30,880
Boys.

1688
01:46:09,400 --> 01:46:10,520
Dev.

1689
01:47:32,680 --> 01:47:34,120
Leave me.

1690
01:50:02,640 --> 01:50:05,120
1Even if the woman if your wife,
if she doesn't like it, never touch her.

1691
01:50:05,160 --> 01:50:06,680
That's manliness.

1692
01:50:06,720 --> 01:50:08,280
Scoundrel.

1693
01:50:15,760 --> 01:50:18,000
She was a common girl then.

1694
01:50:18,400 --> 01:50:20,800
Now, she has the support
of people of Karnataka.

1695
01:50:21,200 --> 01:50:26,600
Just one compliant, you will go to jail.

1696
01:50:27,360 --> 01:50:28,760
Beware.

1697
01:50:41,720 --> 01:50:42,240
Hello.

1698
01:50:42,280 --> 01:50:43,480
Can I speak to Ms. Pavitra?

1699
01:50:43,960 --> 01:50:46,360
- Yes.
- We are calling from Nuances Analysis.

1700
01:50:46,400 --> 01:50:47,800
Your visa and passport are ready.

1701
01:50:48,560 --> 01:50:50,880
So, get ready to fly for
Canada the day after tomorrow.

1702
01:50:53,160 --> 01:50:54,960
Thank you. Thank you so much.

1703
01:50:58,720 --> 01:50:59,400
Mother.

1704
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:01,600
Mother. Where are you?

1705
01:51:01,640 --> 01:51:03,560
- What?
- I'm so happy.

1706
01:51:03,920 --> 01:51:05,040
Mother.

1707
01:51:05,360 --> 01:51:06,480
What happened?

1708
01:51:06,880 --> 01:51:07,720
What happened?

1709
01:51:07,760 --> 01:51:08,640
Father.

1710
01:51:08,680 --> 01:51:10,600
Tell us what it is,
even we will feel happy.

1711
01:51:10,640 --> 01:51:12,440
I'm going to Canada in two days.

1712
01:51:12,480 --> 01:51:13,240
- Really?
- Really?

1713
01:51:13,280 --> 01:51:14,840
I got a call from the office.

1714
01:51:14,880 --> 01:51:16,760
All formalities are done. Yes.

1715
01:51:16,800 --> 01:51:17,960
Great.

1716
01:51:19,560 --> 01:51:21,240
May God grant you success.

1717
01:51:22,240 --> 01:51:26,200
Finally, your dreams will come true.
I'm very happy.

1718
01:51:26,240 --> 01:51:27,240
Thank you, father.

1719
01:51:27,280 --> 01:51:29,800
Pavi, inform Dev about it right away.

1720
01:51:30,040 --> 01:51:31,480
Yes.

1721
01:51:31,840 --> 01:51:34,520
No, father.
I want to tell him in person.

1722
01:51:34,920 --> 01:51:38,520
I want to see Dev's reaction
when I tell him I'm going to Canada.

1723
01:51:38,560 --> 01:51:40,080
Okay. I'm getting late. Bye.

1724
01:51:47,280 --> 01:51:49,200
- Look--
- Dev, happy news.

1725
01:51:49,240 --> 01:51:49,640
What is it?

1726
01:51:49,680 --> 01:51:52,440
I got my visa and tickets. I'm
going to Canada the day after tomorrow.

1727
01:51:54,200 --> 01:51:59,040
Superb, Pavi. Finally, your
dream has come true. I'm very happy.

1728
01:51:59,080 --> 01:52:03,680
Thank you so much.
I'm here to tell you about it in person.

1729
01:52:04,240 --> 01:52:05,880
I need to shop urgently.

1730
01:52:06,120 --> 01:52:08,320
You have to be with
me the entire day. Okay?

1731
01:52:08,360 --> 01:52:09,720
- Go and get ready.
- Okay.

1732
01:52:11,400 --> 01:52:12,240
Pavi.

1733
01:52:12,720 --> 01:52:16,200
Won't you throw a party for us?

1734
01:52:16,520 --> 01:52:18,680
Are you happy that I'm going?

1735
01:52:19,680 --> 01:52:23,400
Let's at least mourn.

1736
01:52:25,320 --> 01:52:26,960
Neither for happiness or for mourning.

1737
01:53:44,240 --> 01:53:45,480
Hey, what?

1738
01:53:48,200 --> 01:53:49,000
Here.

1739
01:53:57,920 --> 01:53:59,200
- I hope you didn't forget anything.
- No.

1740
01:53:59,240 --> 01:54:00,320
- You can't go again tomorrow.
- You are back.

1741
01:54:00,360 --> 01:54:00,880
Yes, mother.

1742
01:54:00,920 --> 01:54:01,360
Yes.

1743
01:54:01,400 --> 01:54:03,120
You finished shopping too.

1744
01:54:03,680 --> 01:54:06,120
It was possible because Dev came along.

1745
01:54:06,160 --> 01:54:07,400
Is this the only thing?

1746
01:54:07,440 --> 01:54:10,600
No, mother. It is because
of him all my dreams have come true.

1747
01:54:12,080 --> 01:54:13,880
It was Vishwa who informed
you about the interview...

1748
01:54:13,920 --> 01:54:16,320
...and it was you who pass it.
I did nothing.

1749
01:54:16,760 --> 01:54:18,040
But still, Dev--

1750
01:54:18,080 --> 01:54:20,520
There is no time to talk.
Where is father?

1751
01:54:20,560 --> 01:54:21,800
I'm here.

1752
01:54:22,680 --> 01:54:25,080
- What is it? Hi, Dev.
- Hi.

1753
01:54:25,120 --> 01:54:26,120
Have you become baggage boy?

1754
01:54:26,360 --> 01:54:28,040
Father, are the papers ready?

1755
01:54:28,280 --> 01:54:29,360
I have kept everything ready.

1756
01:54:29,400 --> 01:54:32,960
Mother, please pack this.
And keep the cosmetics separately.

1757
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:33,760
- Okay.
- It's here.

1758
01:54:33,800 --> 01:54:34,960
Dev, I will freshen up and come. Okay?

1759
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:36,800
Okay. I will help aunt.

1760
01:54:36,840 --> 01:54:37,680
Okay.

1761
01:54:43,240 --> 01:54:44,320
- Dev.
- Yes.

1762
01:54:45,640 --> 01:54:47,680
She broke the marriage the other day...

1763
01:54:48,920 --> 01:54:51,240
...now, she is going
away breaking relationships.

1764
01:54:51,880 --> 01:54:54,800
Our efforts failed
before her stubbornness.

1765
01:54:55,640 --> 01:54:57,080
Dev, at least you--

1766
01:54:57,120 --> 01:54:59,760
- Aunt, how can I tell her?
- Yes, Dev.

1767
01:55:00,080 --> 01:55:02,040
You have to talk to her.
If you don't--

1768
01:55:02,080 --> 01:55:03,520
- Mother, come here.
- Aunt--

1769
01:55:12,680 --> 01:55:13,760
Leave early to the airport tomorrow.

1770
01:55:13,800 --> 01:55:15,320
- Dev, let's go.
- Where to?

1771
01:55:15,360 --> 01:55:18,400
Father, I have some work with Dev.
I need to go.

1772
01:55:18,440 --> 01:55:19,560
- Go.
- Let's go.

1773
01:55:21,160 --> 01:55:23,520
Dev, you forgot an important work.

1774
01:55:23,920 --> 01:55:25,160
Me? What is it?

1775
01:55:25,720 --> 01:55:27,000
Come, I will tell you.

1776
01:55:27,040 --> 01:55:28,840
Pavi, give me the key. I will drive.

1777
01:55:29,440 --> 01:55:30,760
Okay.

1778
01:56:02,480 --> 01:56:04,920
If both are together like this,
it would be great, isn't it?

1779
01:56:05,400 --> 01:56:06,400
Yes.

1780
01:56:07,240 --> 01:56:08,880
I see a change in her.

1781
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:13,000
I feel she won't go leaving
us and Dev, isn't it?

1782
01:56:16,800 --> 01:56:18,400
Cheers.

1783
01:56:22,960 --> 01:56:27,800
Friends, I'm throwing a party
today as Pavi is going to Canada.

1784
01:56:27,840 --> 01:56:28,800
- Superb.
- Wonderful.

1785
01:56:28,840 --> 01:56:29,400
Thank you.

1786
01:56:29,440 --> 01:56:32,880
It is she who is throwing the party.
Why are you clapping for him?

1787
01:56:32,920 --> 01:56:33,840
- I knew it.
- It's okay.

1788
01:56:34,680 --> 01:56:37,480
No matter who throws the party,
but it is we who is celebrating.

1789
01:56:37,720 --> 01:56:38,800
- Right.
- You are right. I agree.

1790
01:56:38,840 --> 01:56:40,360
- Correct.
- Correct.

1791
01:56:40,400 --> 01:56:43,320
Have a wonderful journey.

1792
01:56:43,880 --> 01:56:45,960
- Pavi, wish you good luck.
- Thanks.

1793
01:56:46,480 --> 01:56:49,760
No matter who the sponsor is,
make a drink, let's continue the party.

1794
01:56:50,240 --> 01:56:51,320
Come on.

1795
01:56:56,240 --> 01:56:57,440
No.

1796
01:57:00,200 --> 01:57:01,600
Only cold drink for you.

1797
01:57:01,840 --> 01:57:04,080
Cold drink? No way, I want beer.

1798
01:57:04,120 --> 01:57:05,480
Beer? That's it?

1799
01:57:05,720 --> 01:57:06,480
- Okay?
- Yes.

1800
01:57:06,520 --> 01:57:07,080
Amazing.

1801
01:57:09,200 --> 01:57:10,720
- Thank you.
- Give me too.

1802
01:57:12,720 --> 01:57:13,920
I'm done.

1803
01:57:14,240 --> 01:57:16,600
Once he starts,
he doesn't stop drinking.

1804
01:57:16,640 --> 01:57:19,360
Drink and die. Catch it.

1805
01:57:19,880 --> 01:57:20,680
Me too.

1806
01:57:20,720 --> 01:57:21,400
Catch it.

1807
01:57:26,080 --> 01:57:29,400
Pavi, why are you sitting here alone?

1808
01:57:34,560 --> 01:57:35,840
Why are you looking at me like that?

1809
01:57:38,320 --> 01:57:39,680
Look there.

1810
01:57:40,880 --> 01:57:45,400
I wish we were kids all our life.

1811
01:57:47,800 --> 01:57:49,440
But why are you talking about it now?

1812
01:57:49,680 --> 01:57:52,880
Yes. I shouldn't
be talking about it now.

1813
01:57:53,760 --> 01:57:55,920
I should've asked my
mother the other day itself...

1814
01:57:56,480 --> 01:57:58,040
...whether the person
who's about to die...

1815
01:57:58,360 --> 01:58:00,120
...or the person who's still
living is important.

1816
01:58:00,360 --> 01:58:01,720
It is too late now.

1817
01:58:02,080 --> 01:58:04,520
I ruined your life.

1818
01:58:07,920 --> 01:58:09,080
Pavi, close your eyes.

1819
01:58:09,880 --> 01:58:10,680
Why?

1820
01:58:11,160 --> 01:58:12,520
Close your eyes, I will tell you.

1821
01:58:13,480 --> 01:58:15,160
Forget the past.

1822
01:58:16,120 --> 01:58:20,120
Forget all the bad incidents
that took place in your life.

1823
01:58:21,040 --> 01:58:22,440
Open your eyes like a new-born baby...

1824
01:58:22,480 --> 01:58:24,080
...who's seeing the world
for the first time.

1825
01:58:27,480 --> 01:58:28,320
Thank you.

1826
01:58:29,640 --> 01:58:30,480
Let's go.

1827
01:58:31,480 --> 01:58:32,400
- Dev.
- Yes.

1828
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:37,960
Will you please sing the
climax song from your story?

1829
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:38,920
Please.

1830
01:59:11,120 --> 01:59:15,720
 "Why did you leave me and go?
You could've been with me."

1831
01:59:16,080 --> 01:59:20,520
 "Who do I scold now? You or myself?"

1832
01:59:20,760 --> 01:59:24,200
 "Answer me?"

1833
01:59:25,040 --> 01:59:27,280
 "Did you find some other guy?"

1834
01:59:27,320 --> 01:59:29,400
 "Did you find some other guy?"

1835
01:59:29,440 --> 01:59:31,720
 "Is he good as me?"

1836
01:59:31,760 --> 01:59:34,040
 "Is he good as me?"

1837
01:59:34,440 --> 01:59:39,000
 "Why did you leave me and go?
You could've been with me."

1838
01:59:57,160 --> 02:00:05,240
 "One of your sandals is in my room,
there is the other one?"

1839
02:00:06,120 --> 02:00:14,920
 "The rose you gave me has dried up,
I feel like crying."

1840
02:00:15,520 --> 02:00:24,600
 "Shall I find another
girl or should I wait for you?"

1841
02:00:25,320 --> 02:00:29,840
 "Let's talk and sort
out our differences."

1842
02:00:29,880 --> 02:00:33,720
 "Let's have watermelon juice."

1843
02:00:34,200 --> 02:00:36,520
 "Let's quarrel again."

1844
02:00:36,560 --> 02:00:38,600
 "Let's quarrel again."

1845
02:00:38,640 --> 02:00:40,920
 "Where shall we meet?"

1846
02:00:40,960 --> 02:00:43,400
 "Where shall we meet?"

1847
02:00:43,440 --> 02:00:48,720
 "Why did you leave me and go?
You could've been with me."

1848
02:00:55,240 --> 02:00:57,360
 "He is right."

1849
02:01:20,440 --> 02:01:29,320
 "It was just a minor issue,
how can you walk away from me?"

1850
02:01:29,760 --> 02:01:33,960
 "Alright, I will take the blame on me."

1851
02:01:36,280 --> 02:01:40,960
 "All the promises were broken."

1852
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:45,800
 "I had kissed you stealthily."

1853
02:01:45,840 --> 02:01:50,440
 "How will I ease my pain?
Which liquor shall I go?"

1854
02:01:50,480 --> 02:01:53,960
 "I want to ease my pain."

1855
02:01:54,520 --> 02:01:56,960
 "How much will I drink?"

1856
02:01:57,000 --> 02:01:59,160
 "How much will I drink?"

1857
02:01:59,200 --> 02:02:01,440
 "Those who know, please tell me."

1858
02:02:01,480 --> 02:02:03,840
 "Those who know, please tell me."

1859
02:02:03,880 --> 02:02:09,920
 "Why did you leave me and go?
You could've been with me."

1860
02:02:29,840 --> 02:02:31,720
Nani, where is Dev?

1861
02:02:33,080 --> 02:02:34,760
He must be dancing somewhere.
Go and find him.

1862
02:02:35,040 --> 02:02:36,760
I did look, but I couldn't find him.

1863
02:02:38,880 --> 02:02:40,920
He must be writing to his father. Go.

1864
02:02:41,200 --> 02:02:42,520
Writing to his father?

1865
02:02:48,640 --> 02:02:51,880
As Pavi desired,
she is going to Canada tomorrow, father.

1866
02:02:52,400 --> 02:02:53,880
Bless her.

1867
02:02:59,240 --> 02:03:00,160
Pavi?

1868
02:03:00,640 --> 02:03:01,480
What's this?

1869
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:03,040
Pavi--

1870
02:03:23,840 --> 02:03:26,840
'Pavi has not been talking to
me for the last three months, father.'

1871
02:03:27,160 --> 02:03:28,520
'I don't know the reason.'

1872
02:03:29,200 --> 02:03:30,880
'It is very painful, father.'

1873
02:03:31,320 --> 02:03:34,920
'Firstly,
you abandoned me and now, Pavi.'

1874
02:03:35,440 --> 02:03:36,960
'Why does it happen to me?'

1875
02:03:37,360 --> 02:03:39,760
'Is it wrong to think that
everybody should be happy?'

1876
02:03:52,480 --> 02:03:53,880
Why have you kept this here?

1877
02:04:04,560 --> 02:04:05,640
What's this?

1878
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:10,440
You stooped so low for me?

1879
02:04:13,320 --> 02:04:17,960
It says that you are an impotent.

1880
02:04:20,640 --> 02:04:21,920
Why did you do like this?

1881
02:04:22,560 --> 02:04:26,800
We needed a strong
reason for divorce, Pavi.

1882
02:04:47,840 --> 02:04:51,000
Did you see, Pavi?
He is always like this.

1883
02:04:51,640 --> 02:04:53,320
For his self-satisfaction...

1884
02:04:53,360 --> 02:04:58,040
...he used to write letters
and keep them before his parents.

1885
02:05:06,920 --> 02:05:07,920
Stop it.

1886
02:05:11,400 --> 02:05:12,920
It is very painful.

1887
02:05:14,400 --> 02:05:20,240
There is curiosity in every
scene whether or not both will unite.

1888
02:05:22,160 --> 02:05:26,040
Nowadays, people consider
love to be just sexual pleasure...

1889
02:05:26,280 --> 02:05:28,640
...but you have
portrayed it as God. Wow.

1890
02:05:30,440 --> 02:05:32,680
People say I'm stonehearted.

1891
02:05:33,080 --> 02:05:35,560
But today, you made me emotional.

1892
02:05:35,840 --> 02:05:36,960
You are great.

1893
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:37,880
Thank you, sir.

1894
02:05:38,880 --> 02:05:40,240
Nagaraj, bring the cheque book.

1895
02:05:40,280 --> 02:05:40,800
Okay, sir.

1896
02:05:40,840 --> 02:05:44,840
All these years, we have portrayed
friends as husband and wife in films.

1897
02:05:45,120 --> 02:05:46,080
- Sir.
- But--

1898
02:05:46,120 --> 02:05:51,160
..for the first time, you've
portrayed husband and wife as friends.

1899
02:05:52,160 --> 02:05:54,520
It is a new effort in love stories.

1900
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:55,960
- Dev.
- Sir.

1901
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:59,080
Like you said, your story is the hero.

1902
02:06:02,080 --> 02:06:03,280
Give him the guesthouse
key today itself.

1903
02:06:03,320 --> 02:06:03,880
Okay, sir.

1904
02:06:03,920 --> 02:06:04,960
- Dev.
- Sir.

1905
02:06:05,960 --> 02:06:06,520
Here.

1906
02:06:07,760 --> 02:06:09,040
Get started with your
work from today itself.

1907
02:06:09,080 --> 02:06:09,880
Okay, sir.

1908
02:06:10,240 --> 02:06:13,880
Love which has patience and dance
which doesn't miss a beat never fail.

1909
02:06:14,160 --> 02:06:16,720
It is the same with your story too.

1910
02:06:17,400 --> 02:06:18,440
Good luck.

1911
02:06:18,680 --> 02:06:19,680
- Thank you, sir.
- All the best.

1912
02:06:19,720 --> 02:06:20,320
Thank you.

1913
02:06:22,440 --> 02:06:24,160
Sir, wait a minute.

1914
02:06:24,840 --> 02:06:26,520
I liked the story very much.

1915
02:06:26,560 --> 02:06:27,040
Thanks.

1916
02:06:27,080 --> 02:06:28,960
Will you mind if I asked you something?

1917
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:29,480
Tell me.

1918
02:06:29,520 --> 02:06:32,200
What about the climax
scene in your story?

1919
02:06:32,720 --> 02:06:36,240
I'm curious to know. Please tell me.

1920
02:06:37,560 --> 02:06:39,000
Even I will know the
climax only tomorrow.

1921
02:06:40,320 --> 02:06:42,440
What do you think the climax should be?

1922
02:06:42,480 --> 02:06:44,840
It will be justice
only if both unite, sir.

1923
02:06:50,640 --> 02:06:54,560
Firstly, You grant sorrow and
then grant happiness to good people...

1924
02:06:54,960 --> 02:06:58,600
...if it is true,
please don't let Dev down.

1925
02:06:59,280 --> 02:07:01,920
Dev is such a good boy
who doesn't even address us...

1926
02:07:01,960 --> 02:07:04,440
...as in-laws thinking Pavi
will get angry.

1927
02:07:04,880 --> 02:07:06,160
Please do justice to him.

1928
02:07:06,440 --> 02:07:08,280
At least now, change Pavi's mind.

1929
02:07:08,680 --> 02:07:10,440
She shouldn't go leaving him.

1930
02:07:10,840 --> 02:07:13,000
Please unite them, God.

1931
02:07:14,440 --> 02:07:17,840
Are you praying to God
that Pavi shouldn't leave Dev...

1932
02:07:17,880 --> 02:07:19,200
...and to unite them?

1933
02:07:20,800 --> 02:07:21,680
Yes.

1934
02:07:22,960 --> 02:07:24,760
We tried to advise her.

1935
02:07:26,440 --> 02:07:27,960
We also scolded her.

1936
02:07:28,960 --> 02:07:31,280
But she is being stubborn.

1937
02:07:32,520 --> 02:07:34,200
I don't know what to do.

1938
02:07:36,120 --> 02:07:38,280
Even the sun and the
moon from the same sky...

1939
02:07:38,680 --> 02:07:40,880
...cannot get away from
the game of night and day.

1940
02:07:41,440 --> 02:07:44,880
The moon is unaware
of the power of the sun.

1941
02:07:45,760 --> 02:07:50,600
Pavi will understand Dev
only when the darkness is gone.

1942
02:07:51,200 --> 02:07:52,480
When will that happen?

1943
02:07:54,920 --> 02:07:56,280
God Himself has to decide.

1944
02:08:02,080 --> 02:08:03,080
Dev.

1945
02:08:04,120 --> 02:08:05,480
I'm ready.

1946
02:08:05,920 --> 02:08:07,400
You are coming to the airport,
aren't you?

1947
02:08:08,720 --> 02:08:13,040
You have to come. There's something
I want to talk to you about.

1948
02:08:13,280 --> 02:08:14,640
Okay? Okay. Bye.

1949
02:08:16,880 --> 02:08:18,320
What could it be?

1950
02:08:18,360 --> 02:08:21,520
Maybe she will tell Dev
that she won't leave him and go.

1951
02:08:22,120 --> 02:08:26,000
She has seen Dev's
humanity all these days.

1952
02:08:26,720 --> 02:08:28,520
She must be feeling shy to tell us.

1953
02:08:28,920 --> 02:08:30,200
Hence, she is calling him.

1954
02:08:30,240 --> 02:08:31,120
Aishu.

1955
02:08:31,520 --> 02:08:33,640
I hope what you are saying comes true.

1956
02:08:34,960 --> 02:08:35,960
Father, shall we leave?

1957
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:37,440
Yes, I'm coming.

1958
02:08:37,480 --> 02:08:38,600
Father, I'm getting late.

1959
02:08:38,640 --> 02:08:41,160
Okay, let's go.
Go first.

1960
02:08:52,840 --> 02:08:54,320
We are very late.

1961
02:09:02,400 --> 02:09:03,520
Uncle, Pavi?

1962
02:09:03,800 --> 02:09:05,880
She was waiting for you.
Why are you late?

1963
02:09:05,920 --> 02:09:06,920
Traffic, uncle.

1964
02:09:07,200 --> 02:09:09,480
You could've at least called me?

1965
02:09:09,520 --> 02:09:12,600
I knew you were coming
and there was time too.

1966
02:09:12,640 --> 02:09:13,400
Then where's Pavi?

1967
02:09:13,440 --> 02:09:15,640
She has gone to exchange currency.

1968
02:09:16,480 --> 02:09:17,520
Hey Pavi!

1969
02:09:18,160 --> 02:09:18,840
Hi.

1970
02:09:18,880 --> 02:09:19,600
Hi.

1971
02:09:20,480 --> 02:09:21,840
- Happy journey.
- Thank you.

1972
02:09:22,080 --> 02:09:24,920
Even you have to move from
state level to national level.

1973
02:09:24,960 --> 02:09:26,320
Sure.

1974
02:09:26,360 --> 02:09:28,880
I will become a player at
national level before you come back.

1975
02:09:29,920 --> 02:09:33,480
You go to international level,
she will go to national level...

1976
02:09:33,520 --> 02:09:35,800
...and we will remain as we are.

1977
02:09:35,840 --> 02:09:36,720
Come on, Nani.

1978
02:09:37,080 --> 02:09:39,760
Even you should become
a famous comedian.

1979
02:09:40,200 --> 02:09:44,120
Only a good actor can live in the hearts
of people. You have to become one.

1980
02:09:44,160 --> 02:09:45,800
Talk to Das too.

1981
02:09:45,840 --> 02:09:49,120
Otherwise, he will drink all
day saying Pavi didn't talk to me.

1982
02:09:50,240 --> 02:09:54,640
Das, stop drinking
and achieve something.

1983
02:09:55,080 --> 02:09:55,520
Okay, Pavi.

1984
02:09:55,560 --> 02:09:56,040
Dev.

1985
02:09:56,080 --> 02:09:56,880
Yes.

1986
02:09:58,160 --> 02:10:01,080
We forgot something important.
Tell me what is it?

1987
02:10:03,400 --> 02:10:05,080
- Dev, I'll just come.
- Okay.

1988
02:10:18,360 --> 02:10:19,840
What could it be?

1989
02:10:19,880 --> 02:10:20,760
I don't know.

1990
02:10:29,280 --> 02:10:30,680
Do you know what the important thing is?

1991
02:10:32,920 --> 02:10:34,760
- I don't know.
- It is to thank Vishwa.

1992
02:10:35,040 --> 02:10:38,960
Vishwa supported our dreams and efforts.

1993
02:10:40,280 --> 02:10:41,000
Thank you so much.

1994
02:10:41,040 --> 02:10:41,600
It's okay.

1995
02:10:48,720 --> 02:10:49,880
Open it.

1996
02:11:04,560 --> 02:11:05,280
Thanks.

1997
02:11:05,320 --> 02:11:09,680
Even when God grants you one thing,
He takes away the other thing.

1998
02:11:10,480 --> 02:11:13,400
But you gave me whatever I asked for.

1999
02:11:13,720 --> 02:11:16,720
I know how much you
suffered because of me.

2000
02:11:17,560 --> 02:11:21,120
And I also know how
much I made you suffer.

2001
02:11:21,960 --> 02:11:26,240
At that point of time, you understood
me keeping yourself into my shoes.

2002
02:11:26,280 --> 02:11:29,840
Sorry, Dev. I couldn't be you.

2003
02:11:39,880 --> 02:11:41,000
Mother.

2004
02:11:43,800 --> 02:11:45,760
Finally, you did what you wanted to do.

2005
02:11:45,800 --> 02:11:48,000
No, mother. You're wrong.

2006
02:11:50,200 --> 02:11:52,240
I only achieved what I wanted to.

2007
02:11:54,400 --> 02:11:57,480
My intention is not to hurt anybody.

2008
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:04,480
Will you both bless me?

2009
02:12:04,760 --> 02:12:08,680
Parents always want
their children to be happy.

2010
02:12:09,520 --> 02:12:13,360
We don't stop you from doing
anything you want so that you're happy.

2011
02:12:14,880 --> 02:12:16,280
Wherever you are, be happy.

2012
02:12:17,360 --> 02:12:18,360
Take care of yourself.

2013
02:12:20,720 --> 02:12:21,600
Bye.

2014
02:12:34,840 --> 02:12:37,560
'Do you like me?'

2015
02:12:38,440 --> 02:12:41,240
'Do you like me?'

2016
02:12:41,880 --> 02:12:43,720
I can't see her going away.

2017
02:12:43,960 --> 02:12:45,080
Tell me when she's gone.

2018
02:12:46,880 --> 02:12:48,080
Is she gone?

2019
02:12:49,240 --> 02:12:50,400
Not yet.

2020
02:12:50,640 --> 02:12:51,920
'Do you like me?'

2021
02:12:51,960 --> 02:12:52,960
Is she gone?

2022
02:12:55,680 --> 02:12:58,080
Buddy, she turned around.

2023
02:13:00,520 --> 02:13:04,320
Dev, I like you.

2024
02:13:13,760 --> 02:13:16,960
Buddy... she said she likes me.

2025
02:13:17,760 --> 02:13:19,360
My Pavi said she likes me.

2026
02:13:20,160 --> 02:13:22,480
- She said--
- Stop it.

2027
02:13:22,520 --> 02:13:25,800
I thought she will hug
and say 'I love you' to you.

2028
02:13:26,880 --> 02:13:29,280
Are you both doing melodrama?

2029
02:13:30,160 --> 02:13:34,040
You both bring bad name to love.

2030
02:13:34,800 --> 02:13:35,920
Bad name.

2031
02:13:37,240 --> 02:13:39,280
We brought bad name to love?

2032
02:13:39,880 --> 02:13:42,080
How? How?

2033
02:13:42,880 --> 02:13:45,120
Don't you know we are friends?

2034
02:13:49,240 --> 02:13:53,240
Look Nani, love can be
shared only between two people...

2035
02:13:53,960 --> 02:13:57,520
...but friendship can be
shared with the entire world.

2036
02:13:58,560 --> 02:13:59,960
What did she say?

2037
02:14:00,960 --> 02:14:02,520
She said she likes me.

2038
02:14:03,680 --> 02:14:06,360
She never said she loves me. No.

2039
02:14:09,480 --> 02:14:11,240
You fulfilled her dreams...

2040
02:14:11,840 --> 02:14:14,320
...but she ended up to
be just a dream in your life.

2041
02:14:15,200 --> 02:14:18,200
You still talk good about her.

2042
02:14:19,480 --> 02:14:20,560
Don't you get angry?

2043
02:14:22,520 --> 02:14:24,080
Why should I get angry, uncle?

2044
02:14:25,400 --> 02:14:29,080
Since we got divorced,
doesn't mean we are enemies.

2045
02:14:30,560 --> 02:14:35,680
As a good friend,
I helped her in fulfilling her dreams.

2046
02:14:37,520 --> 02:14:38,600
Is it wrong, uncle?

2047
02:14:40,200 --> 02:14:41,880
It is we who wronged, Dev.

2048
02:14:43,400 --> 02:14:47,080
Since we were stubborn the other day,
your life got ruined.

2049
02:14:47,920 --> 02:14:51,160
That's why I was never stubborn, aunt.

2050
02:14:51,200 --> 02:14:53,600
What about your future?

2051
02:14:54,880 --> 02:14:55,880
What do I say, uncle?

2052
02:14:56,360 --> 02:14:59,040
A person loses his leg in an accident...

2053
02:14:59,720 --> 02:15:03,520
...if he screams 'my leg',
will he get back his leg? No.

2054
02:15:04,120 --> 02:15:05,840
He lost it and he
will never get it back.

2055
02:15:07,920 --> 02:15:09,040
It is the same with love.

2056
02:15:09,320 --> 02:15:12,080
Once it comes to an end, it's over.

2057
02:15:13,080 --> 02:15:16,720
I'm not a Superman
to achieve impossible.

2058
02:15:17,520 --> 02:15:19,080
I'm a common man too.

2059
02:15:20,440 --> 02:15:24,240
We have to find our own ways.

2060
02:15:25,280 --> 02:15:28,120
If I got addicted to liquor
thinking my life is ruined...

2061
02:15:28,760 --> 02:15:30,360
...I would've become like Das.

2062
02:15:31,400 --> 02:15:34,280
But I accepted Pavi as my friend.

2063
02:15:35,120 --> 02:15:36,800
I say it again.

2064
02:15:37,800 --> 02:15:39,400
Pavi is only my friend.

2065
02:15:40,520 --> 02:15:42,720
Though people misunderstood
our friendship...

2066
02:15:43,200 --> 02:15:45,280
...we were still good friends.

2067
02:15:46,360 --> 02:15:49,080
That doesn't mean I
will be alone all my life.

2068
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:52,080
Even man needs a woman.

2069
02:15:52,560 --> 02:15:54,720
Similarly,
even woman needs the support of a man.

2070
02:15:55,680 --> 02:15:57,280
It is the law of nature.

2071
02:15:59,280 --> 02:16:00,320
Look at Lacchu.

2072
02:16:00,360 --> 02:16:02,560
She said she loves me very much...

2073
02:16:03,240 --> 02:16:04,600
...but I said I can't accept her love.

2074
02:16:05,520 --> 02:16:07,200
I had my own reasons.

2075
02:16:07,920 --> 02:16:10,440
It was my duty to fulfil Pavi's dreams.

2076
02:16:11,520 --> 02:16:12,760
Lacchu was still studying.

2077
02:16:13,200 --> 02:16:16,200
She was trying hard to get selected
for state level volleyball team.

2078
02:16:16,840 --> 02:16:19,560
I didn't want to distract her.

2079
02:16:20,920 --> 02:16:22,480
Even I had my grandpa's wealth...

2080
02:16:23,120 --> 02:16:25,040
...but I never had my own status.

2081
02:16:26,480 --> 02:16:28,680
Now, both of us have
a status in the society.

2082
02:16:29,320 --> 02:16:31,320
I have the ability to look after her.

2083
02:16:31,720 --> 02:16:33,840
All these days,
I refused to accept her love...

2084
02:16:34,120 --> 02:16:35,320
...did she get upset?

2085
02:16:36,200 --> 02:16:37,240
She didn't.

2086
02:16:38,720 --> 02:16:41,800
Now, if I tell her I love her,
will she get upset?

2087
02:16:43,760 --> 02:16:45,040
Why are you looking at me like that?

2088
02:16:45,920 --> 02:16:47,280
Do you like me?

2089
02:16:47,880 --> 02:16:49,560
Like you? Hey.

2090
02:16:50,520 --> 02:16:53,800
You are my life. I love you so much.

2091
02:16:59,360 --> 02:17:06,680
 "I'll be dead if I see your smile."

2092
02:17:07,120 --> 02:17:14,320
 "Golden deer,
if I come after you, I'm finished."

2093
02:17:14,360 --> 02:17:18,520
 "You never replied to my message."

2094
02:17:18,560 --> 02:17:22,400
 "O boy, I surrender myself to you."

2095
02:17:22,440 --> 02:17:29,760
 "I'm not such kind of a guy."

2096
02:17:30,960 --> 02:17:33,480
 "Hey girl."

2097
02:17:34,840 --> 02:17:37,960
 "You are very dangerous."

2098
02:17:38,640 --> 02:17:44,960
 "If I come after you,
people will laugh at me."

2099
02:17:47,360 --> 02:17:54,120
 "I'll be dead if I see your smile."

2100
02:17:55,240 --> 02:18:01,720
 "Golden deer,
if I come after you, I'm finished."

2101
02:18:01,760 --> 02:18:02,960
 "You got it all."

2102
02:18:03,000 --> 02:18:04,800
