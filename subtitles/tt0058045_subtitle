1
00:03:32,492 --> 00:03:33,959
You are a rich man today, Bansi.

2
00:03:34,494 --> 00:03:36,462
Have you thought of
what you'll do with Rs.50?

3
00:03:36,563 --> 00:03:37,962
l'll buy a coat,
a very good coat.

4
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,968
Raj, what will
you buy with your Rs.50?

5
00:03:43,503 --> 00:03:47,963
l want to buy a bed. My back
is broken sleeping on the floor.

6
00:03:48,508 --> 00:03:51,204
Why don't we together
buy a bed?

7
00:03:51,511 --> 00:03:53,479
l have seen a bed for
Rs.100 in the flea market.

8
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:56,981
A royal bed with a
thick mattress on it.

9
00:03:57,517 --> 00:04:00,213
- Mattress. -So soft, we'll fall
asleep the moment we lie down

10
00:04:01,521 --> 00:04:02,488
What do you think?

11
00:04:09,529 --> 00:04:16,992
Raj, you give me Rs.50,
we'll buy a suit of Rs.100.

12
00:04:17,203 --> 00:04:19,228
You wear the suit,
l'll wear the coat.

13
00:04:19,539 --> 00:04:21,006
Or l'll wear the suit,
you wear the coat.

14
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:24,237
That's the problem with this
plan. Why don't you understand?

15
00:04:24,544 --> 00:04:26,512
Without the suit,
the coat is useless.

16
00:04:26,613 --> 00:04:28,012
And without the coat,
the suit is useless.

17
00:04:28,214 --> 00:04:30,512
ls there anything that is
more comforting than sleep?

18
00:04:31,051 --> 00:04:33,019
lf man does not sleep,
how will he dream?

19
00:04:33,219 --> 00:04:35,244
And without dreams,
life is worthless.

20
00:04:35,555 --> 00:04:38,251
You will realise the worth
when l get the bed home.

21
00:04:38,558 --> 00:04:43,018
When you return tired from the
studio, sleep will await you.

22
00:04:43,563 --> 00:04:47,021
The dream fairy
will put her arms around you.

23
00:04:47,567 --> 00:04:49,535
And you will
fall asleep peacefully.

24
00:04:49,636 --> 00:04:52,036
Give me the Rs.50,
l'll get the bed.

25
00:05:18,598 --> 00:05:23,058
Damn! We are ruined.

26
00:05:24,104 --> 00:05:29,565
- ls this a bed?
- No, it's a drum.

27
00:05:29,676 --> 00:05:32,076
l'm out of breath bringing it
here. Help me.

28
00:05:33,613 --> 00:05:37,572
No. When l bought the harmonium,
you were very angry.

29
00:05:37,684 --> 00:05:40,312
You had questioned where l will
keep the harmonium ...

30
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:41,587
in such a small room.

31
00:05:41,688 --> 00:05:45,089
Now l ask you,
where will you keep this cot?

32
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:49,322
Talk with respect. This is
not a cot, it is a bed.

33
00:05:51,031 --> 00:05:55,635
Raj, even now l say, it was
better if you had bought a coat.

34
00:05:55,635 --> 00:05:58,103
You would wear the coat,
l would wear the suit.

35
00:05:58,638 --> 00:06:00,105
Or l would wear the coat,
you would wear the suit.

36
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:05,100
- You are a thankless man.
- What is thankless about this?

37
00:06:07,647 --> 00:06:09,342
Actually, l have
bought this bed for you.

38
00:06:09,649 --> 00:06:11,344
l work in the morning.

39
00:06:11,651 --> 00:06:14,119
l return at midnight
and get up by 6 am.

40
00:06:14,254 --> 00:06:18,122
- How many hours do l sleep?
- 1 , 2...six hours.

41
00:06:18,658 --> 00:06:23,118
You work at night, return in the
morning and sleep until midnight.

42
00:06:23,663 --> 00:06:25,130
Tell me, how many
hours do you sleep?

43
00:06:27,667 --> 00:06:31,125
-:18 hours. - Doesn't
that make this bed yours?

44
00:06:31,671 --> 00:06:33,639
You should actually be
contributing 3 times the money.

45
00:06:34,174 --> 00:06:36,142
lf l contribute Rs.50,
you should contribute Rs.100.

46
00:06:36,676 --> 00:06:38,644
l have been looted in this deal.

47
00:06:39,679 --> 00:06:44,139
- You are right.
- Then give me some more money.

48
00:06:44,684 --> 00:06:47,152
- Money?
- Give me a loan.

49
00:06:49,689 --> 00:06:52,658
Your letter had come.
l forgot to give you.

50
00:06:53,693 --> 00:06:55,661
Give my money.

51
00:06:56,196 --> 00:06:59,654
- Whose letter is it?
- Ramesh's letter from Ahmedabad.

52
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,668
His boss' daughter is coming
to Bombay for the first time.

53
00:07:03,703 --> 00:07:08,402
- Read further. - She will
reach on the evening of 6th.

54
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:12,166
l want you to receive her
at the station.

55
00:07:12,712 --> 00:07:16,409
She may stay here for 2-3 days.
By then, her father will arrive.

56
00:07:16,716 --> 00:07:19,685
She is a rich man's daughter,
a little eccentric.

57
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:23,678
l know it's a bother, but
remember,she's my boss' daughter.

58
00:07:24,224 --> 00:07:28,183
lf you treat her well, she may
be pleased & give me a promotion.

59
00:07:28,728 --> 00:07:30,696
My life will be made.

60
00:07:31,731 --> 00:07:36,191
- Her name is Rekha. She looks...
- What is the date today?

61
00:07:36,736 --> 00:07:40,194
- 6th.
- Then what are you doing here?

62
00:07:41,741 --> 00:07:45,199
Raj listen!
Don't bring that girl here.

63
00:07:46,412 --> 00:07:50,439
You're my friend, and l kept you
here only on the condition ...

64
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,718
that no girl
will come between us.

65
00:07:52,819 --> 00:07:56,448
There is only one thing l
have saved in this house ...

66
00:07:56,756 --> 00:07:57,723
my character.

67
00:07:57,957 --> 00:07:59,720
Nothing will happen
to your character.

68
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:01,454
You are a strange man.

69
00:08:01,761 --> 00:08:03,319
Will the daughter of such
a rich man live in this hovel?

70
00:08:03,429 --> 00:08:05,454
l will put her up
in some nice hotel.

71
00:08:05,765 --> 00:08:07,392
- l'm going.
- Bye.

72
00:08:09,435 --> 00:08:12,233
Listen, fix the bed.

73
00:08:36,796 --> 00:08:39,264
Madam...madam...
Bombay has arrived.

74
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,768
- Bombay?
- Yes, Bombay.

75
00:09:05,825 --> 00:09:12,287
Hello. Are you Rekha? You
have come from Ahmedabad, right?

76
00:09:12,832 --> 00:09:15,801
l searched the entire train.
l thought you had not come.

77
00:09:15,902 --> 00:09:18,302
- You must have fallen asleep.
- Yes.

78
00:09:18,838 --> 00:09:24,003
- But who are you? - l am
Raj Kumar, Ramesh's friend.

79
00:09:24,344 --> 00:09:27,006
He wrote to me that you are
coming, so l came to take you.

80
00:09:27,113 --> 00:09:29,308
Let's go.
Where is your luggage?

81
00:09:29,849 --> 00:09:32,317
- Luggage?
- Don't you have any luggage?

82
00:09:33,853 --> 00:09:35,821
Maybe it's following.

83
00:09:36,856 --> 00:09:37,823
Let's go.

84
00:09:45,865 --> 00:09:48,333
Your ticket...your ticket?

85
00:09:49,869 --> 00:09:53,828
- Ticket.
- You don't have it? Rs.24.90.

86
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:57,341
- What? - Rs.24.90.
- Rs.24?Don't you have a ticket?

87
00:09:58,878 --> 00:10:02,245
Do you have money?
...You have no money either?

88
00:10:03,383 --> 00:10:06,841
- You pay for her.
- But ...

89
00:10:07,086 --> 00:10:08,053
Pay up.

90
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:21,867
Come.

91
00:10:27,907 --> 00:10:32,867
Name..Rekha.
She has come from Ahmedabad.

92
00:10:33,913 --> 00:10:36,882
She will return to Ahmedabad.

93
00:10:37,917 --> 00:10:40,385
Arrival date...6th. Departure
date...she doesn't know it yet.

94
00:10:46,926 --> 00:10:50,885
She will stay
for...for a few days.

95
00:10:53,933 --> 00:10:57,630
Reason for
coming...on a holiday.

96
00:11:01,274 --> 00:11:02,241
Sign here.

97
00:11:04,944 --> 00:11:06,411
Sign here.

98
00:11:13,953 --> 00:11:16,922
This is a nice hotel,
you won't have any problem here.

99
00:11:17,023 --> 00:11:20,925
Show her to her room,
l'll come some other time.

100
00:11:21,461 --> 00:11:22,428
Good day.

101
00:11:22,962 --> 00:11:24,429
Boy, room number:39.

102
00:11:31,971 --> 00:11:34,940
- How much?
- Rs.3.

103
00:11:35,975 --> 00:11:37,943
Here you are....thank you.

104
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,439
- Rekha, you?
- Rs.3.

105
00:11:51,991 --> 00:11:55,950
You are a strange girl. Why did
you leave the hotel & come here?

106
00:11:56,062 --> 00:11:59,361
l cannot stay there.
People stare at me over there.

107
00:11:59,499 --> 00:12:00,966
l feel scared among strangers.

108
00:12:02,001 --> 00:12:04,469
Then where will you live?

109
00:12:04,804 --> 00:12:07,295
- Where you live.
- Not at all!

110
00:12:08,674 --> 00:12:10,972
l myself live as someone's
guest, how can you live there?

111
00:12:11,077 --> 00:12:16,982
People will...Take Rs.3
and go back.

112
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:20,484
- l don't want money.
- Then do as you please.

113
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:21,587
l am going.

114
00:14:07,126 --> 00:14:08,821
Do you intend to
stand here all night?

115
00:14:10,796 --> 00:14:12,764
l cannot go to a hotel.

116
00:14:13,132 --> 00:14:15,600
You don't want to
take me where you live.

117
00:14:16,135 --> 00:14:18,603
The night can
be spend in the street.

118
00:14:19,138 --> 00:14:20,833
You go and take rest.

119
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:26,100
l cannot take rest. How can
l leave you here and go up?

120
00:14:27,146 --> 00:14:29,114
- Hello.
- Hello.

121
00:14:30,149 --> 00:14:33,778
- You did go earlier.
- That is why l came back.

122
00:14:34,153 --> 00:14:38,317
Come up and see
the condition l live in.

123
00:14:38,424 --> 00:14:40,619
lt's impossible for
you to stay there. Come.

124
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,628
Wait, l'll follow first,
you follow me later.

125
00:15:14,694 --> 00:15:16,662
Just look at the
state of the room.

126
00:15:17,196 --> 00:15:20,563
- lt's very nice. - l've heard
a hell hole is bigger than this.

127
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,895
Two of us manage to live
here with great difficulty.

128
00:15:23,202 --> 00:15:25,170
Where two people can live,
even three can.

129
00:15:25,271 --> 00:15:26,670
You are used to living
in a huge mansion.

130
00:15:26,806 --> 00:15:30,173
- lt will be difficult for you.
- Don't worry about me.

131
00:15:30,276 --> 00:15:33,177
How can l not? Look at you,
you are so delicate.

132
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:35,179
This room has no ventilation.

133
00:15:35,281 --> 00:15:37,909
There are lots of mosquitoes
too. What if you fall sick?

134
00:15:38,217 --> 00:15:40,185
l won't fall sick.

135
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:42,187
Look Rekha ...

136
00:15:44,223 --> 00:15:46,589
How do l say...this
room doesn't belong to me.

137
00:15:46,726 --> 00:15:48,193
l myself live
here under obligation.

138
00:15:48,294 --> 00:15:51,695
And he always tells me
no woman should come between us.

139
00:15:52,231 --> 00:15:54,199
l won't come between you two.

140
00:15:54,433 --> 00:15:56,697
Heed me even now and
go and live in a hotel.

141
00:15:57,236 --> 00:15:59,704
lf l had to live in a hotel,
why would l come here?

142
00:16:02,241 --> 00:16:03,606
But why don't you understand?

143
00:16:03,743 --> 00:16:05,608
lf Bansi comes, even l will
be thrown out along with you.

144
00:16:05,745 --> 00:16:07,212
That's all the more better.

145
00:16:08,247 --> 00:16:10,715
- We both will go out.
- You are a strange woman.

146
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:12,215
You are putting me in
trouble along with you.

147
00:16:12,451 --> 00:16:14,214
Bansi will come
in the morning ...

148
00:16:16,055 --> 00:16:19,218
He'll come in the morning.
Alright, there is one solution.

149
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:22,222
lt's just a matter of two days,
then your father will arrive.

150
00:16:22,328 --> 00:16:23,625
We'll manage somehow.

151
00:16:23,763 --> 00:16:25,230
But Bansi must not know.

152
00:16:25,331 --> 00:16:28,232
Let him assume we two live here,
l mean, only he and me live here.

153
00:16:29,268 --> 00:16:31,964
We will leave before he
arrives here in the morning.

154
00:16:32,271 --> 00:16:33,238
Alright.

155
00:16:35,274 --> 00:16:37,242
You sleep here,
l'll sleep outside.

156
00:16:37,343 --> 00:16:39,971
What is this? l will sleep on
the bed and you will sleep out?

157
00:16:40,279 --> 00:16:42,975
Then can l ask you to sleep out?

158
00:16:43,282 --> 00:16:45,250
Or should l say we'll
both sleep here? Oh no!

159
00:16:45,351 --> 00:16:48,252
l'm going out. Close the door.

160
00:17:31,831 --> 00:17:36,291
- Who is it?
- Sorry, l'd forgotten.

161
00:17:46,345 --> 00:17:48,711
- Damn!
- What happened?

162
00:17:48,848 --> 00:17:52,045
Bansi is coming. lf he knows
you are here, l'll be doomed.

163
00:17:52,351 --> 00:17:55,320
- Listen, take care.
- Okay.

164
00:18:09,368 --> 00:18:12,337
Good morning Bansi.
How was the shooting?

165
00:18:12,438 --> 00:18:13,837
How it always is.

166
00:18:14,373 --> 00:18:17,342
l mean, how was the scene?

167
00:18:17,443 --> 00:18:21,345
The director
didn't know the scene.

168
00:18:21,714 --> 00:18:24,342
And the story writer
didn't know the story.

169
00:18:26,385 --> 00:18:28,853
The heroine didn't turn up,
the hero got angry.

170
00:18:29,388 --> 00:18:32,391
And the producer vented
all his anger on us.

171
00:18:32,391 --> 00:18:36,350
We made everyone laugh all night,
& had a headache in the morning

172
00:18:37,396 --> 00:18:42,698
l thought l'll reach
home and take a bath.

173
00:18:42,902 --> 00:18:44,870
And then practice.

174
00:18:45,404 --> 00:18:49,363
You have come back tired,
and must be hungry too.

175
00:18:49,475 --> 00:18:51,102
Take a bath and practice later.

176
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:52,877
Why don't you
have breakfast first?

177
00:18:53,012 --> 00:18:54,877
Look how much
l care for your health.

178
00:18:55,414 --> 00:18:58,872
- Good idea. - Eat eggs.
- l'll order them.

179
00:19:03,422 --> 00:19:07,882
Mohammed, get a
boiled egg and toast.

180
00:19:09,428 --> 00:19:12,397
Bansi, you didn't get
the newspaper today?

181
00:19:12,498 --> 00:19:15,899
Newspaper?
l forgot, l'll get it.

182
00:19:19,104 --> 00:19:20,071
Listen.

183
00:19:26,445 --> 00:19:28,913
- What is it?
- l washed my saree.

184
00:19:29,448 --> 00:19:34,408
- What will you wear now?
- Give me anything.

185
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:41,927
Take.

186
00:19:43,963 --> 00:19:44,930
Pants?

187
00:19:48,133 --> 00:19:50,761
Halt. The money is in my pant.
l'll give it to you.

188
00:19:56,475 --> 00:19:59,444
- Raj, my pant was here.
- Pant?

189
00:19:59,545 --> 00:20:02,446
Yes, l removed it and
kept it here just now.

190
00:20:02,548 --> 00:20:04,846
- Where is it?
- You are mistaken, Bansi.

191
00:20:04,984 --> 00:20:06,451
You came back from the
studio like this only.

192
00:20:07,486 --> 00:20:09,716
l think, you must have tied
this bedsheet in some scene.

193
00:20:09,822 --> 00:20:11,449
And you left
your pant in the studio.

194
00:20:12,491 --> 00:20:15,460
You want to pay him?
l'll pay him.

195
00:20:15,561 --> 00:20:17,461
Your money and my money
is no different.

196
00:20:19,498 --> 00:20:21,466
- How much?
-:10 annas.

197
00:20:24,003 --> 00:20:25,868
Let's go out,
it's stuffy in here.

198
00:20:26,005 --> 00:20:28,803
- Let me rest ...
- Come on.

199
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:34,479
lt's so nice and windy here.

200
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:37,481
-But l want to sit on the bed...
-Sit here.

201
00:20:38,517 --> 00:20:41,975
- We have paid Rs.100 for the bed
- Read today's news.

202
00:20:42,521 --> 00:20:45,490
News? Let's read cinema news.

203
00:20:47,526 --> 00:20:51,895
-'Chhaya' is running in Swastik.
-Which movie is running in Globe?

204
00:20:52,031 --> 00:20:54,898
'Salaam Memsab'
But that theater is not good.

205
00:20:56,035 --> 00:20:57,002
There are many bed bugs there.

206
00:20:57,202 --> 00:21:02,504
l had gone to watch a film
there & was badly bitten by bugs

207
00:21:03,542 --> 00:21:05,510
- Your breakfast has come.
- Where is the tea?

208
00:21:05,611 --> 00:21:08,011
- l'll get it.
- Quick!

209
00:21:10,349 --> 00:21:15,013
These people are nuts, they
never bring the proper order.

210
00:21:16,555 --> 00:21:21,015
'Gharana' is also running ...

211
00:21:25,564 --> 00:21:28,533
- l'm hungry.
- Hungry?

212
00:21:30,069 --> 00:21:33,527
- Eat when we go out.
- l'll die by ...

213
00:21:35,774 --> 00:21:36,741
Stay here ...

214
00:21:43,082 --> 00:21:46,051
A bus stuck between ...

215
00:21:46,585 --> 00:21:49,554
Raj, a bus got stuck
between two trams.

216
00:21:50,589 --> 00:21:55,049
With great difficultly ...

217
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:05,058
And a tram got punctured.
l mean, a bus got punctured.

218
00:22:06,105 --> 00:22:08,073
Strange!

219
00:22:09,608 --> 00:22:12,076
- Let's read race news.
- Okay.

220
00:22:13,612 --> 00:22:14,579
Poona races ...

221
00:22:22,121 --> 00:22:23,588
There was an egg in this.

222
00:22:23,689 --> 00:22:27,090
- lt's in your stomach.
- My stomach?

223
00:22:27,226 --> 00:22:30,593
How is that possible? Man can
do only one thing at a time.

224
00:22:30,696 --> 00:22:33,096
He can either eat, or read.

225
00:22:33,298 --> 00:22:36,790
You did both. You ate the egg,
and also read the paper.

226
00:22:40,139 --> 00:22:42,107
- Maybe...
- Read further.

227
00:22:42,975 --> 00:22:45,603
ln the fifth race ...

228
00:22:48,647 --> 00:22:50,615
People made Rs.1 1 of Rs.10.

229
00:22:58,157 --> 00:23:00,625
- Read again.
- Rs.6661 .

230
00:23:02,661 --> 00:23:04,128
That's made my mouth water.

231
00:23:06,665 --> 00:23:09,133
Rs.6000...that's big money.

232
00:23:09,668 --> 00:23:12,637
Raj, there was a toast in this.
Where did it go?

233
00:23:12,738 --> 00:23:15,639
Where the egg went.

234
00:23:16,675 --> 00:23:18,370
How is that possible?

235
00:23:18,677 --> 00:23:20,144
What's wrong with you, Bansi?

236
00:23:20,679 --> 00:23:23,648
You left your pant in the studio,
and looked for it at home.

237
00:23:23,749 --> 00:23:25,649
You ate the egg and
asked where the egg is.

238
00:23:25,751 --> 00:23:27,378
Now you are
questioning about the toast.

239
00:23:27,686 --> 00:23:29,153
What's wrong with you?

240
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:34,158
- l don't know. Maybe l ate it.
- Read further.

241
00:23:38,697 --> 00:23:40,665
Let me drink the tea first,
or there will be a problem again.

242
00:23:43,702 --> 00:23:45,670
lt was so hot.

243
00:23:46,705 --> 00:23:47,672
Who asked you
to drink it so fast?

244
00:23:47,773 --> 00:23:50,674
What else could l do? Or you'd
tell me again l drank it.

245
00:23:50,776 --> 00:23:53,074
Now do you believe
you did drink the tea?

246
00:23:53,212 --> 00:23:55,180
- Yes.
- Read further.

247
00:23:56,715 --> 00:23:59,684
The tea was good.
Now l'll take a bath and rest.

248
00:24:00,719 --> 00:24:02,687
Bansi wait...Bansi..Bansi!

249
00:24:03,722 --> 00:24:05,690
- Bansi listen...
- No.

250
00:24:12,731 --> 00:24:14,028
Let's leave quickly.

251
00:24:14,133 --> 00:24:16,192
We have no other option but
to stay out all day ...

252
00:24:16,335 --> 00:24:18,428
and return in the evening
when Bansi is not here.

253
00:24:18,737 --> 00:24:22,434
- Let's go...
- Like this?

254
00:24:22,741 --> 00:24:25,437
- Then how?
- ln a towel and pants?

255
00:24:25,744 --> 00:24:27,211
lf anyone sees you,
what will they say?

256
00:24:27,346 --> 00:24:28,438
But my saree is wet.

257
00:24:28,747 --> 00:24:31,716
lt's wet?
Where is it?

258
00:24:44,263 --> 00:24:45,730
You stay here.

259
00:25:23,302 --> 00:25:26,169
- Take, wear this.
- Whose is it?

260
00:25:26,305 --> 00:25:28,273
Whoever's, why do you care?
Just wear it.

261
00:25:30,309 --> 00:25:32,777
- How do l wear it?
- Like everyone wears it.

262
00:25:35,814 --> 00:25:38,783
Oh! Hurry up,
Bansi may come out.

263
00:25:46,825 --> 00:25:49,794
- Hey! Husband! - Why are
you shouting? What is it?

264
00:25:49,895 --> 00:25:52,295
- Someone took my saree.
- Then what is this?

265
00:25:52,497 --> 00:25:54,522
My saree was black,
this one is red.

266
00:25:54,833 --> 00:25:57,301
- Which one was better?
- This is better.

267
00:25:57,502 --> 00:25:59,800
- Then you have benefited.
- But it is wet.

268
00:25:59,905 --> 00:26:01,805
So what?
Wear it when it dries up.

269
00:26:04,843 --> 00:26:07,812
See Raj, there are all kinds
of thieves in this world.

270
00:26:08,347 --> 00:26:10,315
Someone picked the
saree in broad daylight.

271
00:26:14,519 --> 00:26:18,148
Listen...l am ready.

272
00:26:19,858 --> 00:26:22,486
- See. Now you look good.
- What?

273
00:26:22,861 --> 00:26:27,821
l mean, let's go. We'll
have to go the way we came.

274
00:26:28,367 --> 00:26:30,335
No one must
know we are together.

275
00:26:30,535 --> 00:26:32,503
l'll go first, you follow me.

276
00:26:39,878 --> 00:26:42,847
This is Gateway of lndia.

277
00:26:45,884 --> 00:26:50,344
See that?
That's King Shivaji's statue.

278
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:14,378
- What are they taking?
- Food.

279
00:27:15,914 --> 00:27:18,883
- For who?
- For those who work in offices.

280
00:27:19,918 --> 00:27:22,386
Why don't they eat from home
and come, or go home and eat?

281
00:27:22,921 --> 00:27:24,388
They cannot spare
time from work.

282
00:27:25,924 --> 00:27:28,893
- Why do they work?
- To eat.

283
00:27:29,928 --> 00:27:32,897
The people of this city are
strange. They work to eat ...

284
00:27:32,998 --> 00:27:34,397
but don't have time to eat.

285
00:28:08,967 --> 00:28:13,427
- Listen! This is strange.
- What happened?

286
00:28:13,572 --> 00:28:17,941
My saree has come back.
That saree was so nice.

287
00:28:18,176 --> 00:28:20,667
lf your destiny is bad,
what can l do?

288
00:28:20,979 --> 00:28:23,948
- l told you to pick it in
the morning. - But it was wet.

289
00:28:24,049 --> 00:28:26,449
Pick this up,
or even this will go missing.

290
00:28:29,488 --> 00:28:34,289
Look what times are here!
There is cheating everywhere.

291
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:24,338
- Bansi, how are you?
- l'm fine.

292
00:29:24,443 --> 00:29:27,003
What is the matter?
You have come early today.

293
00:29:27,112 --> 00:29:29,512
Yes, our shooting got canceled.

294
00:29:30,048 --> 00:29:33,506
The heroine went
out with the villain.

295
00:29:34,052 --> 00:29:36,748
- With the villain? - Yes.
The director was almost in tears.

296
00:29:37,055 --> 00:29:41,014
The vamp wiped his tears and
the producer sang a sad song.

297
00:29:41,259 --> 00:29:43,022
- That was sad.
- And our shooting got canceled.

298
00:29:45,063 --> 00:29:47,759
But what are you doing here? The
bed is inside & you are outside?

299
00:29:48,066 --> 00:29:51,229
lt was very hot inside.

300
00:29:51,336 --> 00:29:53,531
lt was cooler here, so l
thought of sleeping outside.

301
00:29:54,072 --> 00:29:58,031
Good. You feel hot inside,
l feel cold outside.

302
00:29:58,143 --> 00:30:01,044
- You sleep out, l'll sleep in.
- Why don't you also sleep out?

303
00:30:01,146 --> 00:30:03,376
There's a nice wind blowing.
l'll put your mattress here.

304
00:30:03,582 --> 00:30:06,449
You will feel very hot inside.

305
00:30:06,585 --> 00:30:12,046
No, l'd rather feel hot inside
than catch a chill outside.

306
00:30:12,157 --> 00:30:15,058
- You understand? - You also
try to understand, Bansi.

307
00:30:15,594 --> 00:30:21,055
Even l have a share in that
bed. Even l have paid for it.

308
00:30:21,166 --> 00:30:24,567
- Even l have a right to use it.
- Yes, but the door is closed.

309
00:30:25,103 --> 00:30:29,267
When l came out, it got locked.
lt doesn't open.

310
00:30:29,441 --> 00:30:33,070
Why do you sorry? When doors get
locked in the studio ...

311
00:30:34,112 --> 00:30:35,079
we push like this and open.

312
00:30:45,123 --> 00:30:48,092
Sleep outside indeed!
He wants me to freeze.

313
00:30:48,627 --> 00:30:50,094
Even l have paid for the bed.

314
00:30:55,133 --> 00:31:00,594
Raj, whose room did l enter?
What floor have l come on?

315
00:31:00,805 --> 00:31:03,103
lt is our floor and our room.
Why, what is the matter?

316
00:31:04,142 --> 00:31:06,610
- Our floor and our room?
- Yes. What happened?

317
00:31:07,145 --> 00:31:08,840
l'm asking you,
what's going on?

318
00:31:09,147 --> 00:31:10,842
How do l know,
l was praying.

319
00:31:11,149 --> 00:31:14,118
- What were you doing before
praying? - l was praying.

320
00:31:14,219 --> 00:31:16,119
What were you doing before
praying praying?

321
00:31:16,655 --> 00:31:18,623
Even before that l was praying.

322
00:31:19,157 --> 00:31:22,126
You are praying
a lot these days.

323
00:31:22,227 --> 00:31:25,128
Come inside and l'll
introduce you to your prayer.

324
00:31:27,365 --> 00:31:35,136
- Who is she? - She?
Remember l'd received a letter?

325
00:31:36,174 --> 00:31:37,141
She is the same girl.

326
00:31:37,242 --> 00:31:39,540
She could not live with strangers
in the hotel so she came here.

327
00:31:39,678 --> 00:31:44,138
Raj, what had l told you when
l let you stay in my room?

328
00:31:44,249 --> 00:31:46,410
That no girl
will come between us.

329
00:31:46,518 --> 00:31:49,885
- Then what is this? - She is a
girl, but she's not between us.

330
00:31:50,188 --> 00:31:54,147
You know l have saved
only one thing in Bombay.

331
00:31:54,259 --> 00:31:56,659
- And that is...
- Your character, right?

332
00:31:56,795 --> 00:31:58,160
l told her, but she started
crying, ...

333
00:31:58,263 --> 00:31:59,662
and you know how
soft-hearted l am.

334
00:32:00,198 --> 00:32:01,665
That's my problem too.

335
00:32:01,866 --> 00:32:05,666
l worry how you will face this
tough world with a soft heart.

336
00:32:08,006 --> 00:32:09,667
Did you hear that?
Didn't l tell you?

337
00:32:09,808 --> 00:32:11,571
lf you have problems,
even we have them.

338
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:13,507
Go away, we are not
responsible for the whole world.

339
00:32:13,712 --> 00:32:16,909
But where will l go in
the middle of the night?

340
00:32:17,215 --> 00:32:19,683
- To hell.
- Where will l sleep?

341
00:32:19,818 --> 00:32:22,184
- On the footpath.
- l'll freeze in the cold.

342
00:32:22,287 --> 00:32:23,914
As if Bansi cares.

343
00:32:24,222 --> 00:32:27,191
There is only one thing he has
saved in Bombay, his character.

344
00:32:28,226 --> 00:32:30,194
Get that? Now go away.

345
00:32:30,428 --> 00:32:32,919
Hey mister, whose house is this?

346
00:32:33,231 --> 00:32:34,926
- Yours.
- Who pays the rent?

347
00:32:35,233 --> 00:32:38,691
- You do. - Then who are
you to throw her out?

348
00:32:39,037 --> 00:32:42,200
Does anyone throw out a girl
in the middle of a cold night?

349
00:32:42,307 --> 00:32:44,537
lf anything happens to her,
what will people say?

350
00:32:44,743 --> 00:32:45,937
What will your friend say?

351
00:32:46,244 --> 00:32:48,712
And most important,
what will your heart say?

352
00:32:50,248 --> 00:32:54,207
- What is your name?
- Rekha.

353
00:32:55,253 --> 00:32:59,212
You sleep here. We'll sleep out
in the cold. We're used to it.

354
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:04,228
And close the door.

355
00:33:11,770 --> 00:33:14,238
Raj, the moon is beautiful.

356
00:33:15,273 --> 00:33:21,735
The moon...the moon is here,
not here.

357
00:33:25,283 --> 00:33:29,743
Let's sleep...Gee! lt's cold.

358
00:33:40,298 --> 00:33:43,267
Give old clothes,
take new utensils in exchange.

359
00:34:16,534 --> 00:34:19,298
New utensils
against old clothes?

360
00:34:34,352 --> 00:34:38,311
Look! lsn't this the saree that
was drying here yesterday ...

361
00:34:38,423 --> 00:34:39,913
and went missing in the evening?

362
00:34:40,358 --> 00:34:41,325
Look.

363
00:34:48,867 --> 00:34:51,335
- Who is this girl?
- Seems to be new.

364
00:34:51,436 --> 00:34:53,336
Wonder whose house
she has come to.

365
00:34:53,438 --> 00:34:56,839
We'll see where she takes the
utensils and goes.

366
00:34:58,877 --> 00:35:00,344
She's come...come in.

367
00:35:06,384 --> 00:35:09,353
- She went to Bansi's house.
- Bansi and Raj?

368
00:35:10,388 --> 00:35:13,846
- Among two bachelors...
- A young girl??

369
00:35:14,392 --> 00:35:18,351
God!!!
What the world has come to.

370
00:35:18,463 --> 00:35:20,863
You get in, wife.

371
00:35:22,901 --> 00:35:28,771
- Bansi, buy some utensils.
- Why do we need utensils?

372
00:35:28,907 --> 00:35:30,875
- We eat in a hotel.
- And die in a hospital.

373
00:35:31,409 --> 00:35:35,368
Between the hotel and hospital
comes a home.

374
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:39,382
Now that you have arranged a
girl, why don't you settle down?

375
00:35:41,419 --> 00:35:44,877
Mind your tongue, that girl
is my friend's boss' daughter.

376
00:35:45,423 --> 00:35:47,118
She has only
come for three days.

377
00:35:47,425 --> 00:35:50,121
What did l say
that you are taking offense?

378
00:35:50,428 --> 00:35:53,124
lt's a very close relationship.

379
00:35:53,431 --> 00:35:55,899
My friend's boss' daughter!

380
00:35:58,937 --> 00:36:00,905
He's gone crazy.

381
00:36:01,439 --> 00:36:02,406
Let's go, Raj.

382
00:36:05,443 --> 00:36:08,139
l haven't
practiced since many days.

383
00:36:08,446 --> 00:36:10,141
l feel like practicing today.

384
00:36:10,448 --> 00:36:13,747
- Don't do that, Bansi.
- Why?

385
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:16,750
l mean,
who will give you company?

386
00:36:16,955 --> 00:36:19,423
- You. Play the tabla with me.
- No, my fingers hurt.

387
00:36:19,791 --> 00:36:23,158
- Nonsense. - The last
time you practiced, ...

388
00:36:23,461 --> 00:36:24,928
the neighbor's
baby had started crying.

389
00:36:25,063 --> 00:36:26,928
So what?
We live in a free country.

390
00:36:27,065 --> 00:36:29,932
That baby has a right to cry,
and l have a right to practice.

391
00:37:07,005 --> 00:37:08,973
Bansi, that girl
is crying again.

392
00:37:09,507 --> 00:37:11,975
Bansi, that girl
is crying again!

393
00:37:13,511 --> 00:37:15,479
Bansi, the baby's
mother is coming.

394
00:37:18,516 --> 00:37:20,484
Stop your singing.
My baby is crying.

395
00:37:20,585 --> 00:37:24,487
She is not crying because of my
singing, she is hungry.

396
00:37:24,589 --> 00:37:25,988
Go and feed her.

397
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:27,487
Close the window.

398
00:37:28,526 --> 00:37:29,993
Open it,
let there be ventilation.

399
00:37:43,541 --> 00:37:46,999
- Lovely smell!
- lt's of food.

400
00:37:47,545 --> 00:37:51,003
ls the hotel
guy making fritters?

401
00:37:51,549 --> 00:37:55,508
No, l think someone
is frying kachoris.

402
00:37:56,554 --> 00:37:58,522
l'm beginning to feel hungry.

403
00:38:11,569 --> 00:38:14,037
Kachoris are being fried
in our house.

404
00:38:14,172 --> 00:38:15,139
And we thought it was outside.

405
00:38:16,574 --> 00:38:19,042
They are hot, and crispy too.

406
00:38:21,579 --> 00:38:23,046
They are tasty.

407
00:38:25,583 --> 00:38:28,552
Where did you get the
utensils from? The neighbours?

408
00:38:28,653 --> 00:38:30,746
No, l bought them.

409
00:38:31,089 --> 00:38:34,547
Bought? And the money?

410
00:38:34,659 --> 00:38:37,560
Why do you need money?
Bombay is such a nice city.

411
00:38:37,662 --> 00:38:39,562
l gave old clothes and
bought new utensils in exchange.

412
00:38:39,664 --> 00:38:41,564
Very good!

413
00:38:44,102 --> 00:38:46,570
- My clothes!
- You have only two pairs.

414
00:38:46,671 --> 00:38:49,071
One is hanging there, and you've
given the other in the laundry.

415
00:38:49,607 --> 00:38:51,575
- You scream unnecessarily.
- My clothes were saved.

416
00:38:52,610 --> 00:38:55,579
But my clothes? l didn't
give them in the laundry.

417
00:39:05,123 --> 00:39:07,591
Did you sell my old clothes
for these new utensils?

418
00:39:07,959 --> 00:39:10,587
- l did well, didn't l?
- Yes. - Shut-up, Bansi!

419
00:39:10,695 --> 00:39:13,596
Madam, you have sold our clothes
today, tomorrow you will sell us.

420
00:39:14,632 --> 00:39:17,999
Have you thought
of what we will wear?

421
00:39:18,302 --> 00:39:21,100
l am a poor man. l'd got a pant
stitched with great difficulty.

422
00:39:21,639 --> 00:39:23,334
l had gone hungry for days
and got two shirts for myself.

423
00:39:23,641 --> 00:39:26,610
How do l say this? Shining
utensils don't fill a stomach.

424
00:39:26,744 --> 00:39:30,009
- You understand?
- You made the girl cry.

425
00:39:30,148 --> 00:39:31,115
Shut-up Bansi!

426
00:39:31,649 --> 00:39:36,109
-l cannot say anything to girls.
-Alright!

427
00:39:47,165 --> 00:39:50,623
Please stop crying,
l cannot take it.

428
00:39:50,735 --> 00:39:51,702
Please stop crying.

429
00:39:54,672 --> 00:39:56,139
lf anyone sees,
what will he say?

430
00:39:57,742 --> 00:40:00,643
l have given
you a lot of trouble.

431
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:04,978
You are very angry with me?

432
00:40:05,183 --> 00:40:07,151
No...no.

433
00:40:11,689 --> 00:40:13,657
lt is not your fault, Rekha.

434
00:40:14,692 --> 00:40:19,391
The truth is that a man
becomes so tough ...

435
00:40:19,697 --> 00:40:21,665
fighting the battle of life ...

436
00:40:21,766 --> 00:40:23,996
that he forgets a woman
is very soft hearted.

437
00:40:24,202 --> 00:40:26,170
And that she
gets hurt very easily.

438
00:40:26,904 --> 00:40:27,871
The way you are hurt.

439
00:40:29,707 --> 00:40:33,165
l'm sorry. Now smile.

440
00:40:36,214 --> 00:40:37,181
Smile!

441
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:43,187
Very good.

442
00:40:44,722 --> 00:40:45,689
Smile.

443
00:40:47,225 --> 00:40:50,194
Raj, you have a radio programme
today. Let's go.

444
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:55,199
l had forgotten. l am going
to sing on radio today.

445
00:40:58,736 --> 00:41:01,705
l had forgotten. l am going
to sing on radio today.

446
00:41:35,773 --> 00:41:39,470
- Where did this radio come from?
- Assume l bought it?

447
00:41:39,777 --> 00:41:41,745
Bought?
But what about the money?

448
00:41:41,846 --> 00:41:44,747
Why do we need money?
Bombay is such a nice city.

449
00:41:44,849 --> 00:41:47,147
l gave an old thing
and in exchange ...

450
00:41:47,285 --> 00:41:49,480
- What did you sell now?
- Not yours, Bansi's.

451
00:41:49,787 --> 00:41:52,756
- What?
- Musical instruments.

452
00:41:52,857 --> 00:41:54,256
- Musical instruments?
- l did right?

453
00:41:54,792 --> 00:41:56,259
Now l will be
able to hear your song.

454
00:41:56,394 --> 00:41:59,488
lt's not the question of my
song, but Bansi's practice.

455
00:41:59,797 --> 00:42:00,764
When he comes ...

456
00:42:21,819 --> 00:42:26,279
He's come!
Switch it off.

457
00:42:32,830 --> 00:42:34,798
- Shooting cancel?
- Yes.

458
00:42:35,333 --> 00:42:40,293
We were all thankful. Even l
thought l'll go home & practice.

459
00:42:40,438 --> 00:42:43,805
Practice? But the neighbor's
baby starts crying.

460
00:42:44,842 --> 00:42:46,810
Even that is not
a problem today.

461
00:42:46,978 --> 00:42:50,311
They are noT home.
Their door is locked.

462
00:42:50,848 --> 00:42:53,817
lt's a nice
opportunity to practice.

463
00:42:54,852 --> 00:42:56,820
lt is said that you should not
practice on an empty stomach.

464
00:42:56,921 --> 00:42:58,411
lt's bad for the health.

465
00:42:58,856 --> 00:43:01,222
lf the rats in the stomach
also start singing ...

466
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:02,826
the song becomes a chorus.

467
00:43:03,861 --> 00:43:08,628
- Eat something first.
- Rekha,l'll give you good news.

468
00:43:08,866 --> 00:43:14,327
l have already eaten & the rats
in my stomach are fast asleep.

469
00:43:14,872 --> 00:43:17,568
Music is waiting
to come to my lips.

470
00:43:17,875 --> 00:43:21,834
Move!...Radio?
Where did the radio come from?

471
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:24,848
- lt just came. - Where did you
get the money to buy it?

472
00:43:24,949 --> 00:43:26,849
- Why do you need money?
- Bombay is such a nice city.

473
00:43:26,951 --> 00:43:29,249
Sell old things and buy
new things in exchange.

474
00:43:29,387 --> 00:43:33,847
Don't joke. Where are
my musical instruments?

475
00:43:33,958 --> 00:43:36,358
Where my pant and shirts went.

476
00:43:36,894 --> 00:43:39,362
Bansi, look what
a lovely radio it is.

477
00:43:39,897 --> 00:43:43,856
You should have atleast asked
me before selling my things.

478
00:43:43,968 --> 00:43:45,936
Was l asked when
my things were sold?

479
00:43:46,037 --> 00:43:48,267
Then, you had said
why l am getting angry.

480
00:43:48,406 --> 00:43:49,873
Now l am telling you, Bansi,
why are you getting angry?

481
00:43:49,974 --> 00:43:51,874
Listen to the radio,
you'll feel nice.

482
00:43:52,410 --> 00:43:55,379
Damn your radio! How will l
become a music composer now?

483
00:43:55,913 --> 00:44:00,873
Bansi, music composers are not
dependent on a harmonium.

484
00:44:00,985 --> 00:44:02,885
Tansen, the great composer,
had never seen a harmonium.

485
00:44:03,587 --> 00:44:06,886
Or all harmonium makers
would be great composers.

486
00:44:06,991 --> 00:44:09,619
A composer is one who, whatever,
he touches, ...

487
00:44:09,927 --> 00:44:11,394
becomes a musical instrument.

488
00:44:12,930 --> 00:44:15,899
- ls it? - Yes.
- Shall l show you? - Yes.

489
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,968
- Wait.
- He's said a great thing.

490
00:44:39,457 --> 00:44:41,425
''They call me ...''

491
00:44:41,959 --> 00:44:44,928
''They call me Kallu, the singer''

492
00:44:46,964 --> 00:44:51,424
''We will make a nice pair''

493
00:44:51,969 --> 00:44:54,938
''lf l am one note,
you are another''

494
00:44:57,475 --> 00:45:01,935
''We will make a nice pair''

495
00:45:30,007 --> 00:45:33,966
''l am the king of song,
you are the queen of notes''

496
00:45:44,021 --> 00:45:47,980
''We sing and narrate our story''

497
00:45:50,027 --> 00:45:53,986
''You are the life of my songs''

498
00:46:00,037 --> 00:46:04,997
''Your songs have that magic in
them, O Kallu singer''

499
00:46:05,543 --> 00:46:10,003
''We will make a nice pair''

500
00:46:33,571 --> 00:46:37,530
''Tell me where
our destination lies''

501
00:46:48,085 --> 00:46:51,543
''Where there is the
union of beauty and love''

502
00:46:54,091 --> 00:46:57,549
''Then our destination
is this home''

503
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:06,069
''Look into my eyes''

504
00:47:09,106 --> 00:47:13,065
''We will make a nice pair''

505
00:47:40,638 --> 00:47:44,597
''The world
recognizes me by face''

506
00:47:54,652 --> 00:47:58,611
''You are a loafer,
a nut, a crazy guy''

507
00:48:01,158 --> 00:48:04,616
''No one realizes
what l am at heart''

508
00:48:10,167 --> 00:48:15,127
''There is none like you,
O Kallu singer''

509
00:48:16,173 --> 00:48:20,132
''We will make a nice pair''

510
00:49:19,236 --> 00:49:25,197
- You are back early today.
- Early? l think l am very late.

511
00:49:25,309 --> 00:49:27,607
Late by years, decades.

512
00:49:27,745 --> 00:49:30,213
- What have you bought?
- Open it and see.

513
00:49:33,250 --> 00:49:35,946
lt's beautiful.
Who have you bought it for?

514
00:49:36,253 --> 00:49:38,221
The one l have bought
it for is also beautiful.

515
00:49:38,422 --> 00:49:41,949
- Who?
- Assume it is you.

516
00:49:42,259 --> 00:49:46,719
- Me?
- Try it on. Go.

517
00:49:50,601 --> 00:49:53,570
A letter has come for you.
lt's kept on the radio.

518
00:50:06,784 --> 00:50:12,245
Dear friend, l was busy,
so l could not write earlier.

519
00:50:12,356 --> 00:50:16,258
lt must have been a bother, but
my boss' daughter, Rekha ...

520
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:19,261
could not come to
Bombay for some reason.

521
00:50:25,969 --> 00:50:29,928
My boss' daughter, Rekha could
not come to Bombay ...

522
00:50:30,307 --> 00:50:31,274
for some reason.

523
00:50:31,375 --> 00:50:34,276
She has dropped the
idea for the time being.

524
00:50:41,318 --> 00:50:43,286
How do l look?

525
00:50:46,323 --> 00:50:47,290
Who are you?

526
00:50:50,327 --> 00:50:52,693
- You are not Rekha.
- Then who am l?

527
00:50:52,830 --> 00:50:57,028
That is what l am asking you.
Who are you? Who are you!!

528
00:50:58,335 --> 00:51:02,032
- Why did you play this game?
- Game? What game?

529
00:51:02,339 --> 00:51:05,308
Do you know what this letter
states?Rekha never left Ahmedabad

530
00:51:05,409 --> 00:51:10,039
Why did you cheat me until
today? Why did you lie to me?

531
00:51:10,347 --> 00:51:15,307
l didn't cheat or lie. l just
answered what you asked me.

532
00:51:15,853 --> 00:51:20,313
- Even today, your answer is the
same, isn't it? - But l ...

533
00:51:20,424 --> 00:51:22,824
You are cheating again,
lying again.

534
00:51:23,861 --> 00:51:26,728
l did so much for you. l
tolerated Bansi's abuses, ...

535
00:51:26,864 --> 00:51:28,331
l made enemies
with my neighbours.

536
00:51:28,432 --> 00:51:29,831
And you are lying to me only.

537
00:51:30,367 --> 00:51:32,835
l didn't lie!!

538
00:51:33,570 --> 00:51:38,337
How do l tell you who l am,
where l have come from.

539
00:51:39,376 --> 00:51:43,335
What is left to say now? So
what if your face is innocent...

540
00:51:43,447 --> 00:51:47,349
- but your heart is evil.
- Whatever l am, l am before you.

541
00:51:47,451 --> 00:51:50,852
Accept me if you like,
reject me if you like.

542
00:51:51,388 --> 00:51:54,084
Where is the question
of accepting of rejecting now?

543
00:51:54,391 --> 00:51:56,359
Had l known before, l wouldn't
have been cheated like this.

544
00:51:56,460 --> 00:51:59,088
You still don't know who is
being cheated and who ...

545
00:51:59,196 --> 00:52:00,163
Nor do l want to know!

546
00:52:01,398 --> 00:52:04,367
Go away from here.
Go away!

547
00:52:24,922 --> 00:52:25,889
Hello Rekha.

548
00:52:26,423 --> 00:52:29,881
Rekha, you are sitting here?
What is the matter?

549
00:52:30,427 --> 00:52:33,396
- Nothing.
- Fought with Raj?

550
00:52:35,432 --> 00:52:38,401
- You must have sold
something again. - No.

551
00:52:38,502 --> 00:52:43,906
Then?..l understand. Raj has
become very hot headed these days

552
00:52:44,441 --> 00:52:46,136
He fights with you sometimes,
and fights with me sometimes.

553
00:52:46,443 --> 00:52:48,138
Come, let's teach him a lesson.

554
00:52:48,445 --> 00:52:50,913
He has thrown me
out of the house.

555
00:52:52,249 --> 00:52:56,743
- What did you say? - l know
l am such a bother for you two.

556
00:52:57,454 --> 00:52:59,422
But where do l go alone?

557
00:53:00,457 --> 00:53:05,417
There you go again! Who is he
to throw you out of the house?

558
00:53:05,796 --> 00:53:06,763
Come with me. Come.

559
00:53:12,469 --> 00:53:14,437
Come...don't be afraid.

560
00:53:14,972 --> 00:53:16,940
Let me see how
he throws you out.

561
00:53:18,475 --> 00:53:20,841
Don't stare at me!
You are always fighting.

562
00:53:20,978 --> 00:53:22,445
Who are you to throw her out?

563
00:53:24,982 --> 00:53:26,449
Read this letter.

564
00:53:39,496 --> 00:53:41,964
Raj, come out with me.

565
00:53:50,507 --> 00:53:51,474
Come here.

566
00:53:53,510 --> 00:53:56,968
- This is strange. Who is she?
- Who knows who she is ...

567
00:53:57,114 --> 00:53:58,877
where she has come from.
l asked her so many times ...

568
00:53:59,016 --> 00:54:01,484
but she refuses to answer.
So l threw her out.

569
00:54:02,019 --> 00:54:04,487
-But you brought her back again.
-How was l to know.

570
00:54:04,588 --> 00:54:06,215
She was sitting on
the stairs and crying.

571
00:54:06,523 --> 00:54:07,990
l was worried about
what the neighbours will say.

572
00:54:08,125 --> 00:54:10,491
We had told them she is going
to leave in two days.

573
00:54:10,594 --> 00:54:11,561
What will we tell them now?

574
00:54:14,331 --> 00:54:15,298
l have an idea.

575
00:54:15,532 --> 00:54:18,501
Many trains go out of Bombay
to Delhi, Calcutta, Madras.

576
00:54:18,602 --> 00:54:23,005
You go along with her and
get off at the next station.

577
00:54:23,540 --> 00:54:25,508
We'll be rid of her.
What do you think of the idea?

578
00:54:28,545 --> 00:54:29,512
Good idea.

579
00:54:48,565 --> 00:54:52,023
Bombay is such a huge,
and such a strange city.

580
00:55:13,590 --> 00:55:19,551
''As much as l have loved you,
who will love you that much?''

581
00:55:59,136 --> 00:56:07,100
''You avoided me, you hurt me,
you even broke my heart''

582
00:56:08,145 --> 00:56:15,608
''You tried a lot to leave me,
but l did not leave you''

583
00:56:17,154 --> 00:56:21,352
''Your indifference,
your cruelty''

584
00:56:25,662 --> 00:56:33,125
''As much as l tolerated''
who will tolerate that much?''

585
00:56:38,675 --> 00:56:44,136
''As much as
l have loved you ...''

586
00:57:15,212 --> 00:57:22,675
''My eyes only behold your image,
and no one else's''

587
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:30,683
''l loved you, l desired you,
l worshipped only you''

588
00:57:32,729 --> 00:57:36,688
''Taking your home
to be a temple ...''

589
00:57:40,737 --> 00:57:47,700
''as much as l bowed down,
who else will?''

590
00:57:53,750 --> 00:57:59,211
''As much as
l have loved you ...

591
00:58:24,781 --> 00:58:27,477
Seem to be in
great spirits, Bansi.

592
00:58:27,784 --> 00:58:33,484
- Why are you carrying
this stick? - lt's necessary.

593
00:58:33,790 --> 00:58:37,487
lt's better you throw out the
one you have given shelter to.

594
00:58:38,295 --> 00:58:39,489
Who are you talking about?

595
00:58:39,796 --> 00:58:41,764
The one who everyone
is talking about.

596
00:58:42,299 --> 00:58:46,258
Raj had said her father'll come
in two days and take her away.

597
00:58:46,469 --> 00:58:49,768
lt's so many days now. Wonder if
she even has a father or not.

598
00:58:50,807 --> 00:58:52,502
Shanker, you are unnecessarily
getting angry.

599
00:58:52,809 --> 00:58:57,269
- She has already left. - Then
who is the one who is upstairs?

600
00:58:58,315 --> 00:59:00,783
Upstairs? What are you saying?

601
00:59:08,158 --> 00:59:09,125
Come here.

602
00:59:11,161 --> 00:59:12,128
Raj, come here.

603
00:59:20,837 --> 00:59:22,805
You didn't leave her
in the train?

604
00:59:23,340 --> 00:59:24,807
What could l do?
She came back.

605
00:59:24,908 --> 00:59:27,206
- How did she come back?
- Your plan was bad. - Nonsense!

606
00:59:27,344 --> 00:59:30,541
l have another plan.
Tomorrow is Sunday.

607
00:59:30,847 --> 00:59:33,315
Thousands of
people visit the beach.

608
00:59:33,850 --> 00:59:35,818
l will take her
for a stroll there.

609
00:59:36,353 --> 00:59:39,322
l will leave her in the crowd.
She doesn't know the ways here.

610
00:59:39,522 --> 00:59:40,489
She will be lost.

611
00:59:45,862 --> 00:59:46,829
Give me one.

612
00:59:49,866 --> 00:59:50,833
How much?

613
01:01:17,954 --> 01:01:27,420
''As much as l have loved you,
who will love you that much?''

614
01:01:44,981 --> 01:01:48,940
How strange this Bombay city is.
l'd get lost here without you.

615
01:01:54,991 --> 01:01:57,960
We have walked around so much,
that l have begun to feel sleepy.

616
01:03:12,068 --> 01:03:14,036
l am like this balloon...

617
01:03:15,071 --> 01:03:18,529
which is made of air,
and disappears in air.

618
01:03:21,077 --> 01:03:24,774
Today, l actually felt you
deliberately left me there ...

619
01:03:25,081 --> 01:03:26,048
and ran away.

620
01:03:28,084 --> 01:03:33,044
l did run away, Rekha.
l ran far away from you.

621
01:03:34,591 --> 01:03:37,059
But later l realized, l am
not running away from you ...

622
01:03:37,160 --> 01:03:38,559
l am running away from myself.

623
01:03:40,096 --> 01:03:42,064
You won't leave me now,
will you?

624
01:03:42,599 --> 01:03:45,568
Honestly, l cannot live
even a moment without you.

625
01:03:46,102 --> 01:03:49,560
What do you think?
Can l live without you?

626
01:03:51,107 --> 01:03:56,568
What is this?....Let me see.

627
01:03:57,113 --> 01:04:00,571
- So matters have reached here?
- Leave...leave!

628
01:04:13,129 --> 01:04:14,096
Wait!

629
01:04:15,632 --> 01:04:17,099
Damn you!

630
01:04:19,135 --> 01:04:23,595
Sorry, l wasn't looking.
But it's not my fault. See...

631
01:04:24,140 --> 01:04:25,107
l understand.

632
01:04:25,208 --> 01:04:28,109
Today is Friday.
God bless the couple.

633
01:04:29,479 --> 01:04:32,107
Friday? You mean, she and l?

634
01:04:33,149 --> 01:04:35,617
Thank you, sir.
Did you hear that? lt's Friday!

635
01:04:37,153 --> 01:04:40,611
''Whether it is
Friday night or day''

636
01:04:45,161 --> 01:04:48,619
''Promise to meet me again''

637
01:04:49,365 --> 01:04:52,857
''l'll meet you on Sunday again''

638
01:04:53,169 --> 01:04:57,128
''l have promised to
love you, my love''

639
01:05:33,876 --> 01:05:37,175
''l remember our secret meetings''

640
01:05:38,214 --> 01:05:41,183
''Your avoiding everyone's eyes
and coming secretly''

641
01:05:52,228 --> 01:05:55,686
''Don't ask how
l spent my nights''

642
01:05:56,232 --> 01:05:59,690
''Your blue eyes
cast a magic spell''

643
01:06:01,738 --> 01:06:05,196
''The attack of your eyes
have left a sweet pain''

644
01:06:05,742 --> 01:06:09,200
''l have promised to love you...''

645
01:06:38,274 --> 01:06:42,233
''Not just my life, l can
give up everything for you''

646
01:06:42,779 --> 01:06:46,237
''Don't act proud, heed me''

647
01:06:56,793 --> 01:07:00,251
''Come on, don't bore me''

648
01:07:00,797 --> 01:07:03,994
''Go and lie to someone else''

649
01:07:06,302 --> 01:07:09,760
''This is the heart of a lover''

650
01:07:10,306 --> 01:07:14,265
''l have promised to love you...''

651
01:07:42,338 --> 01:07:45,796
''Don't come out in the
streets all dressed up''

652
01:07:46,342 --> 01:07:50,301
''That's how secrets
gets exposed''

653
01:08:00,356 --> 01:08:03,814
''lf the world puts
hurdles in our way''

654
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:07,818
''l will fly and
come to meet you''

655
01:08:10,366 --> 01:08:13,824
''When you are with me,
l don't fear anything''

656
01:08:14,370 --> 01:08:17,828
''l have promised to love you...''

657
01:08:55,411 --> 01:08:59,108
You? Over here?
l mean, you had left.

658
01:08:59,415 --> 01:09:01,110
Yet you are here?

659
01:09:01,417 --> 01:09:05,376
l had left.
...But he brought me back.

660
01:09:05,488 --> 01:09:09,891
- Where is he?
- l am here.

661
01:09:10,426 --> 01:09:14,385
-We will decide this today, Raj!
-Bansi...outside.

662
01:09:17,433 --> 01:09:21,893
Bansi, we'll decide this today!
Either you will stay here, or me.

663
01:09:22,438 --> 01:09:24,906
Bansi, you want to end years
of friendship in minutes?

664
01:09:25,441 --> 01:09:27,136
You know we have been living
together since years.

665
01:09:27,443 --> 01:09:30,412
Even you know l have saved
my character since years.

666
01:09:30,513 --> 01:09:33,914
l work in films,
but l never look at any girl.

667
01:09:34,050 --> 01:09:35,415
Nor has anyone ever
doubted my character.

668
01:09:35,518 --> 01:09:38,146
But today, everyone
is gossiping about me.

669
01:09:38,454 --> 01:09:40,149
You are right, Bansi.

670
01:09:40,456 --> 01:09:44,916
We have decent women
living in our homes.

671
01:09:45,461 --> 01:09:46,928
There is no place
for such women here!

672
01:09:47,129 --> 01:09:48,619
Don't you dare say another word!

673
01:09:48,731 --> 01:09:51,427
Raj, leave him.
Who all will you fight with?

674
01:09:51,534 --> 01:09:55,766
- Hats off to you, Bansi.
You do what you say. - Shut-up!

675
01:09:55,972 --> 01:09:57,439
Don't interfere
between two friends.

676
01:09:58,474 --> 01:10:01,932
l am warning you Raj, either
this girl will stay here, or l.

677
01:10:02,478 --> 01:10:05,936
Bansi, try to understand.

678
01:10:06,482 --> 01:10:09,451
She is alone, and wonder what
problems have brought her here.

679
01:10:09,552 --> 01:10:12,453
And then, we don't even know who
she is, where she has come from.

680
01:10:12,555 --> 01:10:13,954
lt is just a matter of few days.

681
01:10:14,090 --> 01:10:15,455
As soon as we know,
we'll send her away.

682
01:10:15,558 --> 01:10:17,185
- Let her stay here until then.
- No!

683
01:10:17,493 --> 01:10:19,188
lf she stays here, l'm leaving.

684
01:10:19,495 --> 01:10:21,463
Then you sit and
deal with the neighbours.

685
01:10:39,181 --> 01:10:40,148
Bansi left?

686
01:10:42,518 --> 01:10:46,477
Yes...what do l do?

687
01:10:46,589 --> 01:10:50,821
Even you don't tell me anything.
Your address, family, siblings.

688
01:10:51,027 --> 01:10:52,494
How do l tell you, ...

689
01:10:52,595 --> 01:10:54,995
how do l make you believe
l have no one in the world?

690
01:10:56,198 --> 01:10:59,497
lf l have anyone, it is you.
Only you.

691
01:12:33,629 --> 01:12:37,087
Leave me! Let me die.

692
01:12:37,233 --> 01:12:38,996
Have courage,
don't feel dejected.

693
01:12:39,135 --> 01:12:46,098
Why live in a world where people
make fun of your helplessness?

694
01:12:46,642 --> 01:12:49,611
l hate such a world.
Leave me!

695
01:12:50,146 --> 01:12:52,114
l hate the whole world.

696
01:12:52,648 --> 01:12:55,116
Say that you hate me too.

697
01:12:55,651 --> 01:12:59,109
lt's not that, Raj. You have
earned a bad name because of me.

698
01:12:59,655 --> 01:13:01,350
Your friend, Bansi, left you.

699
01:13:01,657 --> 01:13:05,115
Bansi is my friend.
l know how to convince him.

700
01:13:05,327 --> 01:13:07,227
and l can even shut up the people
l have thought of everything.

701
01:13:07,329 --> 01:13:09,627
What have you thought of?
Who all will you answer?

702
01:13:10,166 --> 01:13:12,134
What will you say?
Who am l?

703
01:13:12,668 --> 01:13:15,637
l don't even want
to know who you are.

704
01:13:15,738 --> 01:13:18,639
Whatever you are,
whoever you are, l'll accept you.

705
01:13:19,008 --> 01:13:23,138
- l'll marry you, Rekha.
- Marry?

706
01:13:26,182 --> 01:13:28,650
Our marriage is a
strange marriage.

707
01:13:29,185 --> 01:13:31,153
The groom is himself
dressing up the bride.

708
01:13:32,688 --> 01:13:35,156
You must have
attended many marriages.

709
01:13:35,691 --> 01:13:38,660
Have you ever
heard of such a thing?

710
01:13:39,695 --> 01:13:42,163
l am more fortunate
than the others.

711
01:13:42,698 --> 01:13:47,397
lf l was a prince,
l'd deck you up in diamonds.

712
01:13:47,703 --> 01:13:50,171
l'd gift you jewelry
studded with precious stones.

713
01:13:50,906 --> 01:13:53,670
But l am a Prince (Rajkumar)
only in name.

714
01:13:54,210 --> 01:13:56,678
l can only afford
glass bangles for my bride.

715
01:13:58,714 --> 01:14:03,174
Even diamonds are worthless
against these glass bangles.

716
01:14:05,387 --> 01:14:07,685
This is how orphans
get married, Rekha.

717
01:14:08,057 --> 01:14:11,424
We only have a band player
who is a pauper like me.

718
01:14:11,727 --> 01:14:13,695
And a hungry priest
who will get us married.

719
01:14:13,796 --> 01:14:15,195
Neither will the groom come
riding a horse ...

720
01:14:15,331 --> 01:14:16,696
nor will the
bride sit in a palanquin.

721
01:14:18,234 --> 01:14:22,694
No guests, nor any relatives to
cry while giving away the bride.

722
01:14:22,805 --> 01:14:26,036
No parents, no bed
done up with flowers.

723
01:14:26,742 --> 01:14:32,703
No sweets, no band, no rituals,
no giving away of the bride.

724
01:14:33,749 --> 01:14:35,717
And then, who will
give away the bride?

725
01:14:36,252 --> 01:14:37,219
l will.

726
01:14:38,754 --> 01:14:40,722
- We are there for you.
- Here's your flower veil.

727
01:14:40,823 --> 01:14:43,223
And look down, the boys are
decorating the marriage podium.

728
01:14:43,759 --> 01:14:45,226
Come and have a look.

729
01:14:58,774 --> 01:15:02,073
Come here...look.

730
01:15:05,781 --> 01:15:09,239
See! Now it's not orphans
who are getting married.

731
01:15:09,785 --> 01:15:13,744
There cannot be a marriage
without sweets. Here they are.

732
01:15:13,856 --> 01:15:17,087
We'll represent the bride,
who'll represent the groom?

733
01:15:17,293 --> 01:15:21,252
l'll tell you. He'll
represent the groom.

734
01:15:21,397 --> 01:15:25,265
Okay, but arrange for a horse,
a palanquin, a band.

735
01:15:42,818 --> 01:15:45,286
Bansi, where did
you get the band from?

736
01:15:45,821 --> 01:15:48,790
A wedding scene was
shot at the studio today.

737
01:15:48,891 --> 01:15:53,191
The producer called for the band.
l requested the director ...

738
01:15:53,329 --> 01:15:55,797
if l could take the band
for my friend's wedding.

739
01:15:55,898 --> 01:15:58,799
He allowed me to take the band
and canceled the shooting.

740
01:15:59,335 --> 01:16:00,302
He's such a good man.

741
01:16:00,502 --> 01:16:01,469
Ready?

742
01:16:07,843 --> 01:16:11,802
See! What large hearted people
live in these small homes.

743
01:16:37,373 --> 01:16:41,332
You sacred us. You didn't
open the door all night ...

744
01:16:41,543 --> 01:16:45,343
all through the next day,
and it's night again.

745
01:16:45,881 --> 01:16:48,850
Have you forgotten
your days, wife?

746
01:16:49,084 --> 01:16:52,247
Don't you feel ashamed to say
such things in her presence?

747
01:16:52,388 --> 01:16:53,355
Take tea, dear.

748
01:16:55,090 --> 01:16:56,352
ls Raj still sleeping?

749
01:16:57,393 --> 01:16:59,361
Wake him up, all the
neighbours are waiting.

750
01:16:59,495 --> 01:17:00,860
Alright, let's go.

751
01:17:19,915 --> 01:17:23,612
You just heard folk music from
Hashim Khan.

752
01:17:23,919 --> 01:17:25,386
We now present ...

753
01:17:25,921 --> 01:17:28,389
A song by the famous
radio singer Raj Kumar.

754
01:17:31,427 --> 01:17:33,395
- The radio is switched off.
- Why?

755
01:17:34,129 --> 01:17:35,892
Drink tea first, then sing.

756
01:17:38,267 --> 01:17:42,897
This is great. The first thing a
man needs in the morning is tea.

757
01:17:43,939 --> 01:17:46,908
- Then you won't get it.
- Why?

758
01:17:47,009 --> 01:17:49,307
Because it is not morning,
it is night.

759
01:17:49,445 --> 01:17:52,414
Night? Then why did
you wake me up so early?

760
01:17:52,948 --> 01:17:55,416
lt is the next night.

761
01:17:55,951 --> 01:17:58,920
Next night?
Where did the day go?

762
01:18:05,961 --> 01:18:11,422
l know. The day hid in the
shade of your tresses.

763
01:18:12,468 --> 01:18:15,926
lt went to sleep like me.
Even l feel like sleeping.

764
01:18:16,472 --> 01:18:19,930
No, not now.
Everyone is waiting for us.

765
01:18:20,476 --> 01:18:21,943
Waiting for us? Why?

766
01:18:22,044 --> 01:18:25,946
They have thrown a party in
honour of our marriage.

767
01:18:27,983 --> 01:18:33,683
-l don't remember.
-Do you remember we are married?

768
01:18:33,989 --> 01:18:39,450
-When did we get married? - When
these flowers had not withered.

769
01:18:41,997 --> 01:18:42,964
These flowers?

770
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:46,968
Who cares about
these flowers now.

771
01:18:51,006 --> 01:18:53,975
l have the blossoms
of the world in my arms.

772
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:28,999
''Let the world
become our enemy''

773
01:19:34,049 --> 01:19:38,008
''l am your groom,
you are my bride''

774
01:20:16,091 --> 01:20:20,050
''The world had stopped me''

775
01:20:20,596 --> 01:20:25,056
'' But l had to belong to you''

776
01:20:39,114 --> 01:20:43,073
''This union had to happen,
so it did''

777
01:20:44,119 --> 01:20:48,078
''Let the world
become our enemy''

778
01:21:17,152 --> 01:21:20,849
''My heart was
desperate for someone''

779
01:21:21,156 --> 01:21:25,115
''My eyes were
craving to see you''

780
01:21:39,675 --> 01:21:43,634
''Love finally came our way''

781
01:21:44,179 --> 01:21:48,138
''Let the world
become our enemy ...''

782
01:22:21,216 --> 01:22:25,175
''l came in a palanquin to
the house of the moon''

783
01:22:26,221 --> 01:22:30,180
''l have brought home the
moonlight as my bride''

784
01:22:44,239 --> 01:22:48,699
''We have committed
no heist or fraud''

785
01:22:49,244 --> 01:22:53,203
''Let the world
become our enemy ...''

786
01:23:14,603 --> 01:23:17,231
'Heaven'? Who made this?

787
01:23:17,606 --> 01:23:22,236
- l did.
- You? l don't understand.

788
01:23:22,344 --> 01:23:28,249
l want to proclaim that if there
is heaven on earth, it is here.

789
01:23:28,784 --> 01:23:31,252
ln this city,
this colony, this home.

790
01:23:32,788 --> 01:23:36,246
Then let's stick this
proclamation outside. Come.

791
01:23:42,297 --> 01:23:47,257
l want to proclaim to the world
that there was only a hovel here

792
01:23:47,369 --> 01:23:49,269
An angel came
and turned it to heaven.

793
01:23:52,307 --> 01:23:53,274
Heaven.

794
01:24:00,315 --> 01:24:02,283
- Sister-in-law!
- Bansi, you?

795
01:24:02,384 --> 01:24:05,478
You have come after many days.
How did you think of us today?

796
01:24:05,587 --> 01:24:10,786
Rekha, l have no one in the
world except you and Raj.

797
01:24:11,326 --> 01:24:13,294
Since it is Divali today, so l
thought of coming ...

798
01:24:13,395 --> 01:24:14,794
and feasting with you.

799
01:24:15,330 --> 01:24:17,298
- Where is Raj?
- He has gone out.

800
01:24:17,399 --> 01:24:21,301
He said he will be back by seven.
Sit, l'll make tea for you.

801
01:24:21,403 --> 01:24:23,803
Very good!

802
01:24:24,339 --> 01:24:27,308
Even l have paid for this bed.

803
01:24:28,343 --> 01:24:29,310
lt's okay.

804
01:24:35,350 --> 01:24:39,047
We even have a stove now?
Very good.

805
01:24:39,354 --> 01:24:41,322
Are you happy?

806
01:24:42,357 --> 01:24:43,824
You don't have
fights now, do you?

807
01:24:44,359 --> 01:24:47,328
That is why Raj
is all praise for you.

808
01:24:48,029 --> 01:24:50,827
He says Rekha
is the smile on his lips.

809
01:24:51,032 --> 01:24:52,522
She is the
fragrance of his breath.

810
01:24:52,634 --> 01:24:58,834
lt is all due to his love for
me, or l am no one special.

811
01:24:59,374 --> 01:25:03,674
No, it is true, he cannot live
even a moment without you now.

812
01:25:04,379 --> 01:25:06,142
- Shall l ask you something?
- Yes.

813
01:25:06,381 --> 01:25:11,842
Today is our first Divali.l want
to give him a gift, but what?

814
01:25:13,388 --> 01:25:16,357
Shall l tell you?
There is a ready made suit.

815
01:25:16,458 --> 01:25:18,358
l have been eying
it since many days.

816
01:25:19,394 --> 01:25:22,852
The suit fits me and Raj.

817
01:25:23,398 --> 01:25:24,865
This is the shop
where you will get it.

818
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:29,369
- This is a great idea.
- You buy this suit.

819
01:25:29,738 --> 01:25:31,706
And l'll buy silver coins.

820
01:25:31,807 --> 01:25:34,105
Do you know what we'll
do in the evening?

821
01:25:34,409 --> 01:25:37,378
- We are going to pray.
- Yes. Make tea.

822
01:27:08,503 --> 01:27:12,462
- What happened?
- A woman came under the bus.

823
01:27:16,011 --> 01:27:19,469
- Want to see?
- No, l cannot watch an accident.

824
01:27:21,516 --> 01:27:22,483
Will she survive?

825
01:27:39,334 --> 01:27:41,495
- When did you come? - l'm
getting bored since two hours.

826
01:27:42,537 --> 01:27:46,234
- What have you stuck on your
head? - A silver coin.

827
01:27:46,541 --> 01:27:50,500
Don't you know, it's Divali
today. We worship silver coins.

828
01:27:50,679 --> 01:27:53,011
Where is Rekha?

829
01:27:53,548 --> 01:27:57,006
Great idea. l have sent her out.
She will be back soon.

830
01:27:57,552 --> 01:28:02,012
Doctor, she is my only daughter.
Her life is in your hands.

831
01:28:02,557 --> 01:28:05,025
Please save her
life at any cost.

832
01:28:05,160 --> 01:28:07,526
Don't worry,
she is not badly injured.

833
01:28:07,629 --> 01:28:09,028
There is no danger to her life.

834
01:28:09,564 --> 01:28:11,259
When will she regain
consciousness?

835
01:28:11,566 --> 01:28:13,261
l have given her
another injection.

836
01:28:13,568 --> 01:28:15,035
She will regain
consciousness soon.

837
01:28:26,081 --> 01:28:27,275
Why have you called me?

838
01:28:27,582 --> 01:28:29,550
The wedding guests are expected
and l yet have a lot to do.

839
01:28:29,651 --> 01:28:32,279
- What is the matter?
- First convince your daughter.

840
01:28:32,587 --> 01:28:35,055
- What for?
- She is refusing to get married.

841
01:28:43,598 --> 01:28:46,567
Chanda,
what is this l am hearing?

842
01:28:47,602 --> 01:28:50,298
- l don't want to marry Kuvar.
- Why?

843
01:28:50,605 --> 01:28:54,302
- l have seen him.
- ls he ugly?

844
01:28:54,943 --> 01:28:58,310
- No, he is very handsome.
- ls he poor?

845
01:28:58,613 --> 01:29:00,581
- No, he is very rich.
- Then what's the problem?

846
01:29:02,617 --> 01:29:05,085
l have seen the
mansion in which he lives.

847
01:29:05,620 --> 01:29:08,088
l have also met the
people he lives with.

848
01:29:08,623 --> 01:29:12,081
- What do you mean?
- Don't ask me that, father.

849
01:29:12,627 --> 01:29:13,594
Answer me.

850
01:29:17,632 --> 01:29:20,601
He was with a nautch girl,
and all sozzled.

851
01:29:21,636 --> 01:29:23,604
l could not
see what happened next.

852
01:29:23,838 --> 01:29:25,601
l could not hear what he spoke.

853
01:29:25,707 --> 01:29:28,335
That's all? And l thought
it was something major.

854
01:29:31,146 --> 01:29:33,114
This itself is a
very major thing for me.

855
01:29:33,314 --> 01:29:36,613
- You have to marry him.
- You are being unfair, father.

856
01:29:36,718 --> 01:29:40,119
- What did you say?
- Sir, you cannot compel Chanda.

857
01:29:40,655 --> 01:29:42,122
lt's the question of her life.

858
01:29:44,159 --> 01:29:46,957
Ranjit, who are you
to interfere in our matters?

859
01:29:47,062 --> 01:29:48,962
- But ...
- Get out of here!

860
01:29:51,666 --> 01:29:54,635
Chanda, l have
no time for arguments.

861
01:29:55,170 --> 01:29:57,638
Kuvar's family is coming
along with their guests.

862
01:29:57,739 --> 01:30:01,641
All our relatives have arrived.
Just think of my honour.

863
01:30:01,876 --> 01:30:03,639
Think of my life!

864
01:30:03,878 --> 01:30:06,642
l plead with you,
stall this marriage.

865
01:30:06,748 --> 01:30:09,376
- Ask the groom to return.
- Ask the groom to return indeed!

866
01:30:09,684 --> 01:30:11,845
What nonsense you talk.
You think it's child's play?

867
01:30:12,187 --> 01:30:14,655
That is what l am saying,
this is not child's play.

868
01:30:14,756 --> 01:30:17,156
lt's a question of my life.Think
twice before you do anything.

869
01:30:17,692 --> 01:30:19,660
l am doing everything
after due thought.

870
01:30:19,761 --> 01:30:21,388
l don't need your advice.

871
01:30:21,496 --> 01:30:23,157
l know what is
good or bad for you.

872
01:30:23,298 --> 01:30:26,165
That's the problem,what you think
is good for me is bad for me.

873
01:30:26,367 --> 01:30:28,335
This marriage won't take place!

874
01:30:33,208 --> 01:30:36,666
This marriage won't take place.

875
01:30:37,212 --> 01:30:40,181
l will give up my life,
but l'll not get married.

876
01:30:40,315 --> 01:30:42,180
No dear,
we won't get you married.

877
01:30:42,717 --> 01:30:49,680
Father, ask
the groom to go back.

878
01:30:57,732 --> 01:31:01,691
The groom went back long ago.
The marriage won't take place now

879
01:31:01,803 --> 01:31:05,204
lt just won't.
l will not compel you.

880
01:31:05,740 --> 01:31:06,707
Father...

881
01:31:13,748 --> 01:31:16,717
-The band that was playing now?
-Band?

882
01:31:19,754 --> 01:31:24,714
That stopped playing. l won't do
anything against your wishes now.

883
01:31:24,826 --> 01:31:27,226
ln your happiness lies mine.

884
01:31:27,762 --> 01:31:31,220
Father, you are so good.

885
01:31:43,778 --> 01:31:47,737
- Father... - What happened?
- This is not our home.

886
01:31:49,784 --> 01:31:54,244
- No, this is a hospital.
- Hospital?

887
01:31:57,792 --> 01:32:01,751
That water front?

888
01:32:03,798 --> 01:32:07,256
- lt's the sea.
- Sea?

889
01:32:07,802 --> 01:32:12,262
- ln aipur?
- No, this is Bombay.

890
01:32:14,809 --> 01:32:17,437
- Since when are we here?
- Since three days.

891
01:32:18,313 --> 01:32:19,780
What had happened to me?

892
01:32:21,816 --> 01:32:24,785
You got hurt
and fell unconscious.

893
01:32:27,822 --> 01:32:34,523
You slapped me so hard
that l fell unconscious ...

894
01:32:34,829 --> 01:32:36,296
and you had
to bring me to Bombay?

895
01:32:36,831 --> 01:32:44,795
Bansi, look....
How does this sign look?

896
01:32:45,406 --> 01:32:48,864
- lt looks like heaven.
- That's what the sign says.

897
01:32:50,411 --> 01:32:51,378
l understand.

898
01:32:52,413 --> 01:32:56,873
Which means, your daughter
fell unconscious in aipur ...

899
01:32:57,018 --> 01:32:58,383
and regained
consciousness in Bombay.

900
01:32:59,420 --> 01:33:01,718
Which means she slept there,
and woke up here.

901
01:33:01,823 --> 01:33:04,383
But what about the three months
she spent outside?

902
01:33:04,492 --> 01:33:06,392
Assume she was sleeping
for those three months.

903
01:33:06,494 --> 01:33:08,894
lt was a dream she saw ...

904
01:33:09,430 --> 01:33:11,398
which she forgot
after she woke up.

905
01:33:11,499 --> 01:33:14,400
Take my advice and don't
even try to ask her ...

906
01:33:14,502 --> 01:33:16,902
how she spend those three months
and where she spent them.

907
01:33:17,438 --> 01:33:21,807
She may lose her memory again,
lose control over her brain ...

908
01:33:21,943 --> 01:33:24,411
and despite finding your
daughter, you may lose her.

909
01:33:24,946 --> 01:33:28,404
- Maybe forever.
- Thank you, doctor.

910
01:33:30,451 --> 01:33:34,410
l am fine now.
Take me home to mother.

911
01:33:34,956 --> 01:33:38,414
Alright, take rest,
l'll ask the doctor.

912
01:34:09,991 --> 01:34:12,459
- Mummy!
- Child.

913
01:34:14,495 --> 01:34:18,454
You are back! You don't know how
l spent the 3 months without you

914
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:20,968
- Three months?
- Yes dear.

915
01:34:21,169 --> 01:34:23,967
She's a mother, she spent
three days like three months.

916
01:34:24,505 --> 01:34:26,973
- Go and take rest.
- Yes, go and rest.

917
01:34:30,511 --> 01:34:34,470
You are too much.You told Chanda
she has come after three months.

918
01:34:35,516 --> 01:34:39,475
Remember, she must never know
she's returned after 3 months

919
01:35:14,889 --> 01:35:16,015
l looked around the whole city.

920
01:35:16,157 --> 01:35:18,250
Railway station, hospital,
police station, ...

921
01:35:18,559 --> 01:35:20,026
but l could
not find her anywhere.

922
01:35:20,161 --> 01:35:22,254
l even told my
colleagues at the studio.

923
01:35:22,563 --> 01:35:23,928
They joined me in the search.

924
01:35:24,065 --> 01:35:27,034
25 of us were looking for her,
but we could not find her.

925
01:35:29,570 --> 01:35:34,530
- What will happen now?
- She left the way she had come.

926
01:35:40,581 --> 01:35:44,039
Raj, look at your state.
What have you done to yourself?

927
01:35:44,252 --> 01:35:45,810
For God sake, forget her, Raj.

928
01:35:49,090 --> 01:35:53,550
- l should forget her? - Yes.
- l should forget my wife?

929
01:35:54,595 --> 01:35:59,055
Forget my life? When l
don't even know how she is...

930
01:35:59,600 --> 01:36:02,569
where she is.
Whether she is alive or ...

931
01:36:04,605 --> 01:36:08,063
Please find her Bansi,
or l will suffocate to death.

932
01:36:14,615 --> 01:36:16,583
Don't miss target.

933
01:36:17,118 --> 01:36:19,586
Then why target at all?

934
01:36:20,621 --> 01:36:24,079
lf you don't find it hanging
there tomorrow, change my name.

935
01:36:24,625 --> 01:36:27,321
You can say that now, but
when you come face to face ...

936
01:36:27,628 --> 01:36:28,595
you'll die with fear.

937
01:36:29,630 --> 01:36:34,590
Just think, he is a man eater.
He has taken many lives.

938
01:36:35,636 --> 01:36:37,103
- Lay a bet?
- Bet.

939
01:36:41,642 --> 01:36:45,100
Raj, a comic play is
going to be conducted on radio.

940
01:36:45,246 --> 01:36:47,612
Hear this, you'll
be pleased as punch.

941
01:36:47,715 --> 01:36:49,342
They asked for you.

942
01:36:49,650 --> 01:36:52,619
l told them Raj and me
will charge Rs.100.

943
01:36:53,154 --> 01:36:56,123
lsn't that great?
They even agreed. Let's go.

944
01:36:56,657 --> 01:36:59,956
No Bansi,
l won't be able to do it.

945
01:37:00,394 --> 01:37:03,625
What nonsense are you talking?
Once you do the rehearsal ...

946
01:37:03,731 --> 01:37:08,361
you'll feel fine. l'll even
give you the Rs.100 l get.

947
01:37:08,669 --> 01:37:13,129
You can buy whatever you like.
Atleast give consent now. Come.

948
01:37:13,674 --> 01:37:15,642
l won't be able to do it, Bansi.

949
01:37:19,680 --> 01:37:21,648
How long can
l run the house alone?

950
01:37:32,693 --> 01:37:39,155
lf that's the case...l'll leave.

951
01:37:40,201 --> 01:37:43,170
Raj, you will leave your Bansi?

952
01:37:44,705 --> 01:37:48,163
Won't you try to understand me?

953
01:37:48,709 --> 01:37:53,669
l am not so cheap.
l can earn for you all my life.

954
01:37:57,218 --> 01:37:59,186
Forgive me, Bansi.

955
01:38:00,721 --> 01:38:04,179
Since Rekha has gone missing,
l'm in a daze.

956
01:38:04,325 --> 01:38:09,194
That's why l'm looking for ways
to get you out of these 4 walls

957
01:38:09,397 --> 01:38:11,695
So that you can forget Rekha.

958
01:38:12,733 --> 01:38:17,193
l feel so miserable
seeing you in this state.

959
01:38:17,738 --> 01:38:22,698
lt is such a long time since
l saw a smile on your face.

960
01:38:25,746 --> 01:38:28,214
Smile..that's better.

961
01:38:29,750 --> 01:38:30,717
Let's go.

962
01:38:33,254 --> 01:38:38,453
- Hello Mr.Mathur. - Ranjit,
we were just talking about you.

963
01:38:38,759 --> 01:38:40,727
- How is everyone at home?
- They are fine.

964
01:38:40,962 --> 01:38:43,726
- What about your hunting?
- That's on.

965
01:38:43,831 --> 01:38:45,731
l hunted an
antler a few days back.

966
01:38:45,833 --> 01:38:47,733
- Great.
- What's great about that?

967
01:38:47,835 --> 01:38:49,462
- My daughter hunted a lion.
- Lion?

968
01:38:49,770 --> 01:38:53,729
Yes, that too, a man-eater.
He had killed 3-4 men.

969
01:38:53,841 --> 01:38:55,741
lf you don't believe me,
go and ask her.

970
01:38:55,876 --> 01:38:57,741
His skin is
hanging in her room.

971
01:38:57,845 --> 01:38:59,745
- l'll go and ask her.
- Go.

972
01:39:01,282 --> 01:39:05,742
Now save your elephant,
it's going to die.

973
01:39:06,787 --> 01:39:09,255
Check and mate.

974
01:39:19,800 --> 01:39:24,760
Raj, recognise her.
Recognise who she is.

975
01:39:26,474 --> 01:39:29,500
- She's Rekha.
- No, she's Chanda.

976
01:39:29,810 --> 01:39:31,778
She is the daughter
of a rich landowner.

977
01:39:32,013 --> 01:39:36,780
She has killed a lion. They state
here the lion was a man-eater.

978
01:39:37,818 --> 01:39:41,777
No Bansi, she is Rekha.
She is Rekha.

979
01:39:42,023 --> 01:39:45,789
The same innocent face,
lost eyes ...

980
01:39:46,827 --> 01:39:49,796
- What's all this about?
- l'll tell you.

981
01:39:50,331 --> 01:39:51,798
A rich girl ran away from home.

982
01:39:51,899 --> 01:39:55,300
A poor guy put
his heart at her feet.

983
01:39:55,836 --> 01:39:59,795
She played with his heart.
When she got tired, she left...

984
01:40:00,341 --> 01:40:01,808
to hunt another prey.

985
01:40:02,343 --> 01:40:04,811
No Bansi,
Rekha is not like that.

986
01:40:04,912 --> 01:40:07,813
l know her. There is
some mystery behind this.

987
01:40:07,915 --> 01:40:11,817
lt's very simple. She is a rich
man's daughter,you're a poor man

988
01:40:12,853 --> 01:40:17,813
- Bansi, l'll go to aipur.
- What are you doing?

989
01:40:17,925 --> 01:40:18,892
lnstead of the lion, ...

990
01:40:18,993 --> 01:40:20,620
your picture will be
published in the next issue.

991
01:40:20,861 --> 01:40:24,558
And the caption will read,
'new prey of Chanda'

992
01:40:27,868 --> 01:40:32,328
You are very naive. Rekha
will be overjoyed to see me.

993
01:40:32,540 --> 01:40:36,840
She will hug me and say,
'Raj, where were you until now?'

994
01:40:37,378 --> 01:40:38,845
'Where had you disappeared?'

995
01:40:38,979 --> 01:40:41,846
And me, l will
not even talk to her.

996
01:40:42,083 --> 01:40:44,847
- Do you know what will
happen then? - What?

997
01:40:45,886 --> 01:40:48,855
She will cry, plead,
and ask for pardon.

998
01:40:49,390 --> 01:40:52,359
- And tell me everything.
- You are a fool.

999
01:40:53,094 --> 01:40:55,858
lf that was the case,
why did she leave you?

1000
01:40:55,963 --> 01:40:58,864
And if she did leave, why did
she not think of you until now?

1001
01:40:59,900 --> 01:41:01,367
l am sure there is some
mystery behind this.

1002
01:41:01,502 --> 01:41:03,060
That's what
l'm going to find out.

1003
01:41:03,404 --> 01:41:05,065
l am sure she
is having some problem.

1004
01:41:05,406 --> 01:41:06,873
Hope it's the way you think.

1005
01:41:07,908 --> 01:41:10,376
What makes you happy,
makes me happy too.

1006
01:41:10,911 --> 01:41:13,379
But l still
fail to understand this.

1007
01:41:13,914 --> 01:41:16,883
A rich landlord's daughter
and you ...

1008
01:41:17,118 --> 01:41:21,077
Bansi, you will understand
everything when l bring her back.

1009
01:41:21,422 --> 01:41:23,390
You'll understand everything.
l am leaving now.

1010
01:41:27,428 --> 01:41:32,889
- You will take only these many
clothes? - l don't have any more.

1011
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:35,230
People will laugh if
you go there in this state.

1012
01:41:35,436 --> 01:41:37,904
They'll poke fun at the
landowner's son-in-law.

1013
01:41:38,939 --> 01:41:42,397
When l got married, l borrowed a
suit from the laundry for a day.

1014
01:41:42,943 --> 01:41:44,911
He won't give it
to me for so many days.

1015
01:41:46,447 --> 01:41:49,644
l have an idea. The head of the
costume department ...

1016
01:41:49,950 --> 01:41:51,645
in my studio is my friend.

1017
01:41:51,952 --> 01:41:54,420
l'll get some from him.
What do you say?

1018
01:41:54,555 --> 01:41:56,648
What would l
do without you, Bansi?

1019
01:41:56,957 --> 01:41:58,925
Don't say such things,
l don't like it.

1020
01:41:59,026 --> 01:42:01,426
You can collect it on the way.

1021
01:42:32,993 --> 01:42:33,960
All lndia Radio.

1022
01:42:36,997 --> 01:42:39,966
- Are you Mr.Raj Kumar?
- Yes.

1023
01:42:41,001 --> 01:42:45,961
l think, you must stop singing
and start writing stories.

1024
01:42:47,007 --> 01:42:50,465
l am sure you will succeed.
You write very well.

1025
01:42:51,011 --> 01:42:53,172
Even stories are
weaved from reality.

1026
01:42:53,514 --> 01:42:55,379
lf this is a story, it is true.

1027
01:42:55,516 --> 01:42:56,983
lt is my life story.

1028
01:42:57,351 --> 01:42:59,717
But how is
that possible, Mr.Raj?

1029
01:43:00,020 --> 01:43:04,389
- This cannot be true.
- How do l make you believe me?

1030
01:43:04,525 --> 01:43:06,993
l have even got married to her
in Bombay.

1031
01:43:07,228 --> 01:43:08,195
ln Bombay?

1032
01:43:10,030 --> 01:43:12,999
But that girl
has never been to Bombay.

1033
01:43:13,234 --> 01:43:17,500
Perhaps you don't know that the
girl mentioned in this letter...

1034
01:43:18,038 --> 01:43:21,496
l don't only know her,
but her entire family.

1035
01:43:22,042 --> 01:43:24,510
Her father is
one of my good friends.

1036
01:43:24,712 --> 01:43:26,680
l meet him often.

1037
01:43:27,548 --> 01:43:34,010
You will be surprised to know
that the girl is not married yet

1038
01:43:36,056 --> 01:43:38,524
The way you don't
believe my story ...

1039
01:43:39,059 --> 01:43:41,527
even l don't understand
what you are saying.

1040
01:43:42,062 --> 01:43:47,022
l plead with you, just tell me
a way l can meet Rekha once.

1041
01:43:47,268 --> 01:43:49,031
l will be grateful
to you for life.

1042
01:43:50,070 --> 01:43:54,530
l am sure the girl you are
looking for is not Chanda.

1043
01:43:55,075 --> 01:43:58,533
Yet, for your satisfaction,
l'll give you her address.

1044
01:43:59,580 --> 01:44:02,048
Go and see the
mansion in which she lives.

1045
01:44:04,084 --> 01:44:07,053
You will realise your mistake.

1046
01:44:11,091 --> 01:44:12,058
Here you are.

1047
01:44:13,093 --> 01:44:14,060
Thank you.

1048
01:44:15,095 --> 01:44:19,054
Mr.Raj, do meet me
before leaving for Bombay.

1049
01:44:20,434 --> 01:44:23,562
Sure. Thank you.

1050
01:45:02,142 --> 01:45:06,101
Come Mr.Raj.
Did you see the mansion?

1051
01:45:09,650 --> 01:45:13,108
Yes, the mansion,
and even Chanda.

1052
01:45:13,654 --> 01:45:15,622
There is no difference
between Rekha and Chanda.

1053
01:45:16,156 --> 01:45:17,623
But Rekha is my wife.

1054
01:45:19,660 --> 01:45:23,619
l am sure you are mistaken.
Two people can look alike.

1055
01:45:24,164 --> 01:45:26,132
Your eyes can make a mistake.

1056
01:45:26,667 --> 01:45:28,635
Before her father
comes to know about you ...

1057
01:45:29,169 --> 01:45:31,797
and he takes some
action against you ...

1058
01:45:32,172 --> 01:45:34,140
l'd advice you to return
to Bombay immediately.

1059
01:45:35,175 --> 01:45:37,143
l won't go back
to Bombay without Rekha.

1060
01:45:37,244 --> 01:45:42,648
Mr.Raj, remember, you will
get burnt if you play with fire.

1061
01:45:42,850 --> 01:45:47,651
The fire is already lit,
l have to get burnt.

1062
01:45:49,189 --> 01:45:52,647
Mr.Raj, you have my sympathies.

1063
01:45:55,195 --> 01:45:58,164
l will give you another
chance to clear your doubts.

1064
01:45:59,199 --> 01:46:00,666
But on one condition.

1065
01:46:14,214 --> 01:46:18,173
''As much as
l have loved you ...''

1066
01:46:22,222 --> 01:46:33,190
''As much as l have loved you,
who will love you that much?''

1067
01:47:10,771 --> 01:47:15,231
''You were disloyal to me
so many times''

1068
01:47:15,776 --> 01:47:19,234
''l took it as your style''

1069
01:47:21,281 --> 01:47:25,741
''lf you made a mistake ...''

1070
01:47:26,286 --> 01:47:28,754
''l blamed myself for it''

1071
01:47:31,291 --> 01:47:35,751
'' Before you, l kept smiling ...''

1072
01:47:41,301 --> 01:47:45,761
''and fooling myself''

1073
01:47:46,306 --> 01:47:49,764
''Who will fool himself so much?''

1074
01:47:56,650 --> 01:48:02,282
''As much as l have loved you...''

1075
01:48:34,855 --> 01:48:39,315
''You were proud
of my love for you''

1076
01:48:39,459 --> 01:48:43,327
''Try to recollect those days''

1077
01:48:44,865 --> 01:48:53,330
''When you wrote
my name on your hand''

1078
01:48:55,375 --> 01:48:59,835
''The innocence of your style''

1079
01:49:05,385 --> 01:49:09,344
''As hard as l fell for it''

1080
01:49:10,390 --> 01:49:14,349
''Who will fall as hard?''

1081
01:49:20,901 --> 01:49:27,864
''As much as l have loved you...''

1082
01:49:51,431 --> 01:49:56,391
You sing so well. There is
so much pain in your voice.

1083
01:49:58,438 --> 01:50:01,407
lt feels like l
have heard you before.

1084
01:50:01,942 --> 01:50:06,402
Yes, not only heard ...

1085
01:50:08,649 --> 01:50:12,415
lt is strange.
Whenever l hear such songs ...

1086
01:50:12,519 --> 01:50:14,419
l feel l have heard them before.

1087
01:50:14,554 --> 01:50:18,923
- Even you liked this song?
- Congratulations uncle.

1088
01:50:19,559 --> 01:50:22,153
lf you present
such artistes always...

1089
01:50:22,462 --> 01:50:24,930
all of lndia will only
listen to aipur radio.

1090
01:50:26,466 --> 01:50:28,934
l'll take your leave, good bye.

1091
01:50:29,970 --> 01:50:30,937
Good bye.

1092
01:50:31,972 --> 01:50:32,939
Listen ...

1093
01:50:38,478 --> 01:50:40,946
You had promised
to remain silent.

1094
01:50:42,482 --> 01:50:44,950
The silence is
intolerable now.

1095
01:50:46,987 --> 01:50:50,445
When your heart bleeds,
how can your lips remain sealed?

1096
01:50:50,824 --> 01:50:54,954
- Uncle, aunt! Come here!
- Letter from Raj?

1097
01:50:55,095 --> 01:50:56,790
- My Raj's letter!
- Read it.

1098
01:50:56,997 --> 01:50:59,465
lt is my Raj's letter,
l will read it at leisure.

1099
01:50:59,566 --> 01:51:00,965
Please read it.

1100
01:51:03,503 --> 01:51:04,970
'Dear Bansi ...'

1101
01:51:08,008 --> 01:51:11,967
'Dear Bansi, l met Rekha'

1102
01:51:12,512 --> 01:51:14,480
'But she did not recognise me'

1103
01:51:16,016 --> 01:51:18,985
'And then suddenly the next day,
they left for Kullu'

1104
01:51:19,519 --> 01:51:20,884
They left for Kullu?

1105
01:51:21,521 --> 01:51:23,489
'l thought
even l'll go to Kullu'

1106
01:51:23,724 --> 01:51:25,692
'l didn't have money'

1107
01:51:26,193 --> 01:51:27,990
Now he'll ask me
to send him money.

1108
01:51:28,528 --> 01:51:30,894
'l thought of
calling for money from you'

1109
01:51:31,031 --> 01:51:31,998
l told you.

1110
01:51:32,532 --> 01:51:35,000
'But by God's grace,
l got to do a show on radio'

1111
01:51:35,202 --> 01:51:37,227
Thank you!
My money was saved.

1112
01:51:37,537 --> 01:51:40,995
'l will leave for Kullu
after l finish this show'

1113
01:51:41,208 --> 01:51:44,507
Where all will my poor Raj
run after this woman?

1114
01:51:45,212 --> 01:51:46,179
God!

1115
01:51:47,047 --> 01:51:50,244
Come Raj Kumar.
Did you get your payment?

1116
01:51:50,550 --> 01:51:51,517
Yes, thank you.

1117
01:51:52,552 --> 01:51:55,020
You have done me another
favour by giving me this show.

1118
01:51:55,555 --> 01:51:57,250
l'll take your leave.
lf l come this way again ...

1119
01:51:57,557 --> 01:51:59,024
l'll surely come to meet you.

1120
01:51:59,893 --> 01:52:01,520
Are you returning
to Bombay today?

1121
01:52:01,762 --> 01:52:05,027
l am not going to Bombay,
l am going to Kullu.

1122
01:52:05,565 --> 01:52:08,033
- Kullu? - Yes.
- What for?

1123
01:52:09,236 --> 01:52:12,034
Rekha is over there.
Good bye.

1124
01:52:22,916 --> 01:52:25,544
Hello. Give me:235.

1125
01:52:28,588 --> 01:52:35,551
Hello, who's calling.
...Oh! How are you?

1126
01:52:36,930 --> 01:52:42,061
A guy has come from Bombay who
says he married Chanda in Bombay

1127
01:52:42,269 --> 01:52:43,236
What!!

1128
01:52:43,937 --> 01:52:47,304
l tried to stop him, but he
is following her to Kullu.

1129
01:52:47,607 --> 01:52:49,074
How dare he!

1130
01:52:50,610 --> 01:52:52,578
He has told you today, tomorrow,
the whole of aipur will know.

1131
01:52:54,614 --> 01:52:57,583
l'll go to Kullu right away.
Thank you.

1132
01:53:23,977 --> 01:53:27,606
''My beau will come drawn to me''

1133
01:53:32,652 --> 01:53:35,621
''Just let my
sighs make the effect''

1134
01:53:35,856 --> 01:53:39,622
''Just let the heartache begin''

1135
01:53:40,160 --> 01:53:43,618
''My beau will
come drawn to me ...''

1136
01:54:11,691 --> 01:54:16,651
''He will make
a hundred excuses''

1137
01:54:20,200 --> 01:54:22,668
'' But he will surely come
to pacify me''

1138
01:54:23,203 --> 01:54:25,000
''Of my annoyance ...''

1139
01:54:25,205 --> 01:54:26,672
''my being hurt ...''

1140
01:54:31,211 --> 01:54:34,669
''just let the cruel man know''

1141

''My beau will

1142
01:55:00,740 --> 01:55:04,198
''How will complaining help?''

1143
01:55:06,746 --> 01:55:09,214
''Only love will''

1144
01:55:10,250 --> 01:55:11,717
''The love is here''

1145
01:55:11,952 --> 01:55:13,715
'' But it has not
reached there yet''

1146
01:55:18,258 --> 01:55:21,716
''Just let the journey end''

1147
01:55:22,262 --> 01:55:25,720
''My beau will

01:55:55,795 --> 01:55:58,764
''How can l sleep?''

1149
01:56:01,801 --> 01:56:04,770
''Even he will lie awake''

01:56:05,005 --> 01:56:06,768
''What my state is ...''

1154
01:56:50,850 --> 01:56:53,819
- Daddy, you? When did you come?
- Just a while ago.

1155
01:56:53,920 --> 01:56:56,821
- But you didn't inform.
- What was the need?

1156
01:56:56,923 --> 01:56:58,322
We made the programme
suddenly and just came.

1157
01:56:58,525 --> 01:57:00,322
- Any reason?
- Not really.

1158
01:57:11,871 --> 01:57:16,831
- Does any man name Raj Kumar
live here? - l am Raj Kumar.

1159
01:57:18,878 --> 01:57:21,346
- Can l come in?
- Please do.

Please be seated, l'll close it.

1162
01:57:34,894 --> 01:57:37,863
- Do you know who l am?
- No.

1163
01:57:38,098 --> 01:57:41,363
My name is Thakur Karan Singh.
l am a rich landowner.

1164
01:57:41,901 --> 01:57:45,359
l am respected
in the entire city.

1165
01:57:46,406 --> 01:57:49,864
l am also the father of a
daughter ...

1166
01:57:49,976 --> 01:57:51,876
who can do anything for her.

1167
01:57:52,412 --> 01:57:54,880
- You are Rekha's father?
- Not Rekha, Chanda.

1168
01:57:55,248 --> 01:57:56,875
And you are forgetting
whose daughter she is.

1169
01:57:57,917 --> 01:57:59,612
Who you call Chanda is Rekha,...

1170
01:57:59,919 --> 01:58:01,887
and even you are forgetting
whose wife she is.

1171
01:58:02,122 --> 01:58:04,386
lt's all a lie.
You have fabricated a story.

1172
01:58:04,924 --> 01:58:06,892
Here's money for your story,
go away from here.

1173
01:58:08,928 --> 01:58:10,395
Your and my relationship
is such ...

1174
01:58:10,530 --> 01:58:12,395
that l should
be seeking your blessing.

1175
01:58:12,932 --> 01:58:15,400
But you lowered yourself in
my esteem by showing me money.

1176
01:58:15,935 --> 01:58:18,403
l don't want money,
l want Rekha.

1177
01:58:18,538 --> 01:58:20,904
- l got married to her.
- Where? - ln Bombay.

1178
01:58:21,441 --> 01:58:22,908
- When?
- Three months ago.

1179
01:58:23,943 --> 01:58:25,638
That place exists
where we got married.

1180
01:58:25,945 --> 01:58:28,243
There are witnesses,
you can ask them.

1181
01:58:28,448 --> 01:58:31,246
- You can ask your daughter.
- l have already asked her.

1182
01:58:31,951 --> 01:58:34,419
She doesn't know
anyone by your name.

1183
01:58:34,554 --> 01:58:35,919
She has never met you.

1184
01:58:37,957 --> 01:58:41,415
- Can l meet Rekha once?
- Why?

1185
01:58:45,965 --> 01:58:48,934
For a moment forget that
you are a rich landowner.

1186
01:58:49,969 --> 01:58:51,937
That the whole
city respects you.

1187
01:58:52,772 --> 01:58:54,933
Also forget that you are
the father of a daughter.

1188
01:58:56,476 --> 01:58:58,944
Just believe that you
are an ordinary man.

1189
01:58:59,979 --> 01:59:02,948
And live in an
ordinary colony in Bombay.

1190
01:59:03,049 --> 01:59:05,449
That you have to work
hard to make a living.

1191
01:59:07,987 --> 01:59:12,447
And then you meet a girl,
who is alone and helpless.

1192
01:59:12,992 --> 01:59:16,951
You give her shelter.
You stay hungry, but feed her.

1193
01:59:18,998 --> 01:59:21,967
You let her sleep in the room,
& yourself sleep in the verandah

1194
01:59:23,203 --> 01:59:27,970
People talk ill about you.
You take the neighbor's abuses.

1195
01:59:30,009 --> 01:59:33,968
She leaves one day,
to commit suicide.

1196
01:59:36,015 --> 01:59:38,984
You save her,
she expresses her love for you.

1197
01:59:40,019 --> 01:59:43,978
You marry her,
you treat her as a Goddess.

1198
01:59:46,025 --> 01:59:53,488
And then, on Divali,
she suddenly disappears.

1199
01:59:54,033 --> 01:59:56,001
Your body remains,
the life gone from it.

1200
01:59:57,036 --> 01:59:59,732
And when you come looking
for your life, ...

1201
02:00:00,039 --> 02:00:02,507
people keep wads
of money before you.

1202
02:00:03,042 --> 02:00:05,510
Life cannot be
valued against money.

1203
02:00:06,546 --> 02:00:09,014
Now if you like,
you can shoot me.

1204
02:00:23,062 --> 02:00:28,364
You can meet Chanda once,
but on one condition.

1205
02:00:28,568 --> 02:00:31,036
Her decision will be final.

1206
02:00:31,571 --> 02:00:34,039
For you, and me.

1207
02:00:34,574 --> 02:00:37,543
lf she tell me she
is married to you ...

1208
02:00:38,077 --> 02:00:41,046
l will myself
escort her to your home.

1209
02:00:41,581 --> 02:00:45,540
And if she says
you are lying ...

1210
02:00:45,685 --> 02:00:51,055
Then l promise l will go very
far away from Chanda's life.

1211
02:00:52,091 --> 02:00:54,059
And will never
mention her name again.

1212
02:00:55,094 --> 02:01:00,555
- You sing on Bombay radio?
- Sometimes on aipur radio too.

1213
02:01:01,768 --> 02:01:07,570
- Where do you live in Bombay?
- What.....Bombay?

1214
02:01:11,611 --> 02:01:17,572
ln a buildiNg which houses lots
of rooms.One of the rooms is mine

1215
02:01:18,117 --> 02:01:20,585
Earlier, l used
to live with my friend.

1216
02:01:21,321 --> 02:01:24,586
- Then a girl came along.
- Girl?

1217
02:01:25,124 --> 02:01:31,586
Yes. Such a big city, and she
was all alone and helpless.

1218
02:01:32,131 --> 02:01:36,591
l gave her shelter in my home,
in my heart.

1219
02:01:38,137 --> 02:01:40,435
- But do you know what she did?
- What?

1220
02:01:40,640 --> 02:01:44,599
She married me,
gave me so much love.

1221
02:01:45,144 --> 02:01:48,113
And then, on Divali night, when
there was brightness all around...

1222
02:01:49,148 --> 02:01:50,615
she disappeared
in that brightness.

1223
02:01:51,150 --> 02:01:55,519
She went away somewhere,
dumping me in the dark.

1224
02:01:55,655 --> 02:01:58,123
- Didn't you look for her?
- l did.

1225
02:01:58,658 --> 02:02:01,923
l even found her, but she
doesn't recognise me.

1226
02:02:02,161 --> 02:02:06,120
How can a wife not
recognise her husband?

1227
02:02:06,666 --> 02:02:09,134
- Where is she?
- Here. - Here?

1228
02:02:10,169 --> 02:02:13,138
- Yes, in this house.
- This house?

1229
02:02:13,239 --> 02:02:14,206
Right before my eyes.

1230
02:02:25,184 --> 02:02:27,152
Don't you still
recognise me, Rekha?

1231
02:02:29,188 --> 02:02:31,156
Then say all that was a lie.

1232
02:02:31,257 --> 02:02:35,557
The wedding band, the henna on
your hands, your dot.

1233
02:02:35,695 --> 02:02:39,153
Rekha, you are my wife.
You are my wife!

1234
02:02:47,206 --> 02:02:49,674
Daddy, what kind of
people do you invite home?

1235
02:03:27,914 --> 02:03:32,715
''The love you had given me''

1236
02:03:33,252 --> 02:03:38,212
''l am returning
that love of yours''

1237
02:03:38,758 --> 02:03:43,218
''You won't have
any complains now''

1238
02:03:43,763 --> 02:03:48,723
''l am going out of your life''

1239
02:03:49,268 --> 02:03:54,228
''The love you had given me ...''

1240
02:04:23,970 --> 02:04:28,270
''You didn't even
let me realise''

1241
02:04:28,808 --> 02:04:31,276
''You brought me at such
a turning point ...''

1242
02:04:31,377 --> 02:04:34,278
''and then shattered my heart''

1243
02:04:47,994 --> 02:04:52,294
''Forget making me yours''

1244
02:04:53,332 --> 02:04:57,792
''You did not leave me fit
to belong to someone else''

1245
02:05:03,843 --> 02:05:08,303
''What do l say about
your unfaithfulness''

1246
02:05:09,348 --> 02:05:13,307
''lt makes me ashamed
of my faithfulness''

1247
02:05:14,353 --> 02:05:19,313
''The love you had given me ...''

1248
02:05:49,889 --> 02:05:53,848
''No one will come after you now''

1249
02:05:54,393 --> 02:05:59,353
''No one will
call out to you now''

1250
02:06:12,912 --> 02:06:17,372
''Who are you turning back
and looking at, O my heart?''

1251
02:06:17,917 --> 02:06:22,877
''Who do you have
who will stop you?''

1252
02:06:28,928 --> 02:06:33,388
''May you have all
the worldly pleasures''

1253
02:06:33,933 --> 02:06:38,893
''l have to be ruined,
l am being ruined''

1254
02:06:39,438 --> 02:06:44,398
''The love you had given me ...''

1255
02:07:16,976 --> 02:07:22,437
Shanker! Aunt!
Raj has sent a parcel for me.

1256
02:07:26,152 --> 02:07:28,950
Look, l won't give
you anything from this.

1257
02:07:29,155 --> 02:07:30,452
Okay!

1258
02:07:38,497 --> 02:07:41,955
- This is the coat l gave him.
- A letter.

1259
02:07:44,170 --> 02:07:45,137
Read it.

1260
02:07:47,506 --> 02:07:48,973
'Dear Bansi...'

1261
02:07:49,508 --> 02:07:50,475
The same again.

1262
02:07:52,178 --> 02:07:55,978
'Look what a
turn life has taken'

1263
02:07:56,515 --> 02:07:58,983
'You were right'

1264
02:07:59,518 --> 02:08:02,487
'That poor man's
Rekha was someone else'

1265
02:08:03,189 --> 02:08:05,987
'She is a rich landowner's
daughter, Chanda'

1266
02:08:08,527 --> 02:08:11,985
'Forget me'

1267
02:08:13,032 --> 02:08:15,000
'Don't try to look for me'

1268
02:08:18,537 --> 02:08:21,995
'Who cares
whether l live or die?'

1269
02:08:22,541 --> 02:08:26,500
'l am sending the suit,
return it'

1270
02:08:28,547 --> 02:08:33,007
'Give my regards
to Shanker and aunt'

1271
02:08:36,055 --> 02:08:39,024
'Don't try to look for me'

1272
02:08:42,061 --> 02:08:44,029
'Your, only yours, Raj'

1273
02:08:46,565 --> 02:08:47,532
My Raj!

1274
02:10:16,655 --> 02:10:18,623
Aunt, Chanda
has fallen unconscious.

1275
02:10:45,684 --> 02:10:46,651
No doctor!

1276
02:11:06,705 --> 02:11:09,674
- The doctor...
- He told me.

1277
02:11:12,711 --> 02:11:14,178
And you believed him?

1278
02:11:15,214 --> 02:11:19,674
But l ask,
how is this possible?

1279
02:11:20,719 --> 02:11:22,186
lt is possible.

1280
02:11:23,055 --> 02:11:28,687
So you know?
Yet you didn't tell me.

1281
02:11:29,728 --> 02:11:32,196
You kept me in the dark,
you deliberately cheated me.

1282
02:11:34,733 --> 02:11:36,701
lt is fate that has cheated us.

1283
02:11:38,737 --> 02:11:42,195
You had lost your memory.

1284
02:11:42,741 --> 02:11:43,708
Memory?

1285
02:11:48,747 --> 02:11:51,716
- Then what happened?
- You were lost.

1286
02:11:52,751 --> 02:11:55,720
What happened during that
period, no one knows.

1287
02:11:56,255 --> 02:12:00,214
l only know that you lived
in Bombay for three months.

1288
02:12:01,760 --> 02:12:04,228
But you told me l was
there only for three days.

1289
02:12:04,763 --> 02:12:06,458
What else could l say?

1290
02:12:06,765 --> 02:12:10,223
A young girl stays out
of home for three months ...

1291
02:12:10,769 --> 02:12:12,737
lf people hear,
what will they say?

1292
02:12:13,772 --> 02:12:15,239
What will they assume?

1293
02:12:17,776 --> 02:12:22,236
And what happened with me, if
anyone hears, what will he say?

1294
02:12:22,781 --> 02:12:25,750
lf one thinks about it,
he'll drown in shame.

1295
02:12:27,286 --> 02:12:31,746
l realise today that the
radio singer was right.

1296
02:12:33,125 --> 02:12:35,491
And l humiliated him and
threw him out of the house.

1297
02:12:36,795 --> 02:12:38,763
Daddy, we must leave
for Bombay today itself.

1298
02:12:39,798 --> 02:12:42,767
l am ready to take Chanda
to Bombay immediately.

1299
02:12:43,302 --> 02:12:45,770
But where will
l look for him there?

1300
02:12:45,904 --> 02:12:48,771
Don't worry about that.

1301
02:12:49,141 --> 02:12:52,770
l will write a note for you. You
will get his address from there.

1302
02:12:54,313 --> 02:12:55,280
Thank you.

1303
02:13:08,327 --> 02:13:09,794
Rekha! Welcome.

1304
02:13:10,329 --> 02:13:15,289
The whole
colony was missing you.

1305
02:13:16,335 --> 02:13:20,795
But you did wrong. You left
the one who gave you shelter...

1306
02:13:21,340 --> 02:13:23,308
who saved your life.

1307
02:13:24,843 --> 02:13:26,310
Saved my life?

1308
02:13:54,373 --> 02:13:55,840
You are back!

1309
02:13:56,208 --> 02:13:59,336
Since you have left, no one has
sung, 'Kallu, the singer' song.

1310
02:14:02,381 --> 02:14:03,348
Kallu, the singer?

1311
02:14:03,882 --> 02:14:08,842
''They call me Kallu, the singer''

1312
02:14:09,388 --> 02:14:13,848
''We will make a nice pair''

1313
02:14:44,923 --> 02:14:46,891
Rekha, where had you gone?

1314
02:14:46,992 --> 02:14:50,621
No marriage has been conducted
with as much pomp ...

1315
02:14:50,929 --> 02:14:51,896
as yours and Raj's.

1316
02:14:51,997 --> 02:14:52,964
Marriage?

1317
02:15:24,963 --> 02:15:27,431
Daddy, this is the
place where l used to live.

1318
02:15:27,966 --> 02:15:31,424
l will apologise to him.
l have hurt him terribly.

1319
02:16:08,674 --> 02:16:13,976
- Rekha, you?
- Yes.

1320
02:16:17,516 --> 02:16:20,485
What have you come here for now?
Everything is over.

1321
02:16:21,019 --> 02:16:24,477
What is left now? Didn't you
feel ashamed to come here now?

1322
02:16:25,023 --> 02:16:26,991
Didn't your feet falter
stepping in this house?

1323
02:16:27,092 --> 02:16:30,493
Go away, go away from here!

1324
02:16:31,029 --> 02:16:34,487
- Where is he?
- Who he? Raj Kumar?

1325
02:16:35,033 --> 02:16:38,400
You care so much for him?
You have come very soon.

1326
02:16:38,537 --> 02:16:41,005
Please tell me where he is,
l plead with you.

1327
02:16:41,540 --> 02:16:42,507
Shall l tell you where he is?

1328
02:16:44,543 --> 02:16:48,502
Even l don't know where he
went in his zombie state.

1329
02:16:49,047 --> 02:16:50,514
Only God knows where he is.

1330
02:16:51,049 --> 02:16:53,517
l will be pleased
to hear he is alive.

1331
02:16:53,652 --> 02:16:57,520
No! Please don't say that,
for God sake!

1332
02:17:16,275 --> 02:17:20,041
- Can you do me a favour?
- What do you want?

1333
02:17:21,413 --> 02:17:24,041
- Let me stay here.
- Here?

1334
02:17:24,583 --> 02:17:26,551
But how will you live here?

1335
02:17:26,818 --> 02:17:29,048
Come back home.
We will inform the police.

1336
02:17:29,154 --> 02:17:30,553
We will publish
a missing report ...

1337
02:17:30,689 --> 02:17:32,054
announce his name on radio.

1338
02:17:32,157 --> 02:17:34,057
We'll find him.

1339
02:17:34,159 --> 02:17:39,563
No daddy, a married woman's
home is her husband's home.

1340
02:17:41,099 --> 02:17:45,559
This is my home,
this is my world, everything.

1341
02:17:46,305 --> 02:17:48,796
l will wait here for him.

1342
02:17:49,107 --> 02:17:52,076
And my heart says he
will surely come one day.

1343
02:17:56,114 --> 02:18:01,074
Excuse me.Give this room to her,
l'll pay whatever price you say.

1344
02:18:01,620 --> 02:18:04,589
Sir, we may be poor ...

1345
02:18:05,123 --> 02:18:06,590
but we are large hearted.

1346
02:18:07,626 --> 02:18:11,585
lf she is your daughter,
even l am like her father.

1347
02:18:12,631 --> 02:18:15,429
Child, this house
now belongs to you.

1348
02:18:16,134 --> 02:18:17,601
Stay here.

1349
02:18:42,160 --> 02:18:44,128
Our marriage is a
strange marriage.

1350
02:18:45,163 --> 02:18:47,131
The groom is himself
dressing up the bride.

1351
02:18:48,667 --> 02:18:51,135
You must have
attended many marriages.

1352
02:18:51,503 --> 02:18:54,131
Have you ever
heard of such a thing?

1353
02:18:54,673 --> 02:18:58,131
l am more fortunate
than the others.

1354
02:18:58,677 --> 02:19:03,478
lf l was a prince,
l'd deck you up in diamonds.

1355
02:19:03,582 --> 02:19:06,642
l did not lie!!

1356
02:19:07,386 --> 02:19:09,149
How do l make you understand ...

1357
02:19:09,254 --> 02:19:12,655
how do l tell you
where l have come from?

1358
02:19:13,692 --> 02:19:17,150
What is left to say now? So what
if your face is innocent ...

1359
02:19:17,396 --> 02:19:18,886
your heart is not.

1360
02:19:19,197 --> 02:19:21,165
You still didn't
recognise me, Rekha?

1361
02:19:23,201 --> 02:19:24,668
Then say all that was a lie.

1362
02:19:25,203 --> 02:19:28,661
The wedding band, the henna on
your hands, your dot.

1363
02:19:29,207 --> 02:19:32,665
Rekha, you are my wife.
You are my wife!

1364
02:20:31,269 --> 02:20:32,236
'Heaven'?

1365
02:21:16,648 --> 02:21:19,776
Rekha, take care of your baby.

1366
02:21:32,330 --> 02:21:33,297
My baby!

1367
02:21:35,333 --> 02:21:37,028
Raj, he has soiled
my clothes many times.

1368
02:21:42,340 --> 02:21:43,307
'Heaven!'
