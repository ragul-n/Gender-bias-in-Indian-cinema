{\an8}RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

3
00:12:29,084 --> 00:12:32,084
THE STORIES AND CHARACTERS DEPICTED
HERE WERE INSPIRED BY OUR HISTORY

4
00:12:34,741 --> 00:12:37,741
NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED DURING
THE FILMING OF THIS PRODUCTION.

5
00:12:50,088 --> 00:12:51,488
You pander!

6
00:12:52,621 --> 00:12:54,188
I will kill you.

7
00:12:55,821 --> 00:12:57,488
What did you want from my wife?

8
00:13:05,721 --> 00:13:07,888
Unfortunately, I got you without
your weapon.

9
00:13:09,254 --> 00:13:11,154
I have never imagined like that.

10
00:13:14,488 --> 00:13:16,821
It should not have been this easy,
Gundogdu.

11
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:43,654
Come on!

12
00:13:44,854 --> 00:13:49,388
Gundogdu Bey! Give a holler!

13
00:13:49,488 --> 00:13:50,821
I am here!

14
00:14:02,388 --> 00:14:03,754
I will be back Gundogdu!

15
00:14:06,088 --> 00:14:09,821
I will never give up until your kin is
nonexistent! Know it!

16
00:14:19,288 --> 00:14:20,788
Gundogdu!

17
00:14:22,888 --> 00:14:24,588
Gundogdu!

18
00:14:26,321 --> 00:14:28,454
Gundogdu!

19
00:14:31,521 --> 00:14:33,088
Have you forgiven me?

20
00:14:33,888 --> 00:14:37,854
Before I die, tell me that you have
forgiven me. Forgive me.

21
00:14:39,154 --> 00:14:40,421
Hatun.

22
00:14:40,788 --> 00:14:41,854
Selcan.

23
00:14:42,088 --> 00:14:44,521
For God's sake. God forbids.

24
00:14:44,688 --> 00:14:47,421
How can it be? Open your eyes! Selcan!

25
00:14:47,488 --> 00:14:49,754
Open your eyes for me! For God's sake.
For our baby.

26
00:14:51,854 --> 00:14:53,588
Bey. Selcan Hatun.

27
00:15:01,321 --> 00:15:04,354
Go, tell the healer. One of you,
go tell the healer, right now!

28
00:15:04,788 --> 00:15:06,521
Come on, hurry up!

29
00:15:37,488 --> 00:15:39,488
Hold on Selcan.

30
00:15:40,521 --> 00:15:41,554
Hold on Hatun.

31
00:15:41,821 --> 00:15:44,621
Hold on for me, hold on for our baby...

32
00:15:45,154 --> 00:15:46,454
...hold on Selcan.

33
00:15:47,754 --> 00:15:49,854
Hurry! Hurry!

34
00:16:10,321 --> 00:16:11,454
She lost so much blood.

35
00:16:11,521 --> 00:16:12,688
Hurry up for God's sake.

36
00:16:12,754 --> 00:16:15,721
Leave Bey. We will take it from here.

37
00:16:23,354 --> 00:16:25,388
Sister! Sister!

38
00:16:25,454 --> 00:16:27,521
Gokce! My sister stop! Stop sister!

39
00:16:27,888 --> 00:16:30,554
Let them, let them do their job.

40
00:16:35,321 --> 00:16:36,821
Brother!

41
00:16:37,521 --> 00:16:38,754
Brother! What happened?

42
00:16:38,821 --> 00:16:41,754
While Titus was trying to kill me...

43
00:16:42,154 --> 00:16:43,688
...Selcan shielded herself to protect me.

44
00:16:44,121 --> 00:16:45,154
How is she now?

45
00:16:45,621 --> 00:16:48,188
She is not good at all. She is not good
at all my brother.

46
00:16:50,521 --> 00:16:52,188
Alps went after him.

47
00:16:52,454 --> 00:16:53,888
On your happiest day...

48
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:57,754
God damn it!

49
00:17:01,488 --> 00:17:02,588
My brother.

50
00:17:06,488 --> 00:17:10,188
I promise you he will pay for the thing
he has done.

51
00:17:10,254 --> 00:17:11,488
If God permits, my brother.

52
00:17:11,621 --> 00:17:13,221
It is all my fault!

53
00:17:13,354 --> 00:17:16,888
It all happened because of me!
I should not have talked to her like that.

54
00:17:17,221 --> 00:17:19,088
Gokce do not say that. Pull yourself
together.

55
00:17:31,888 --> 00:17:33,321
Selcan.

56
00:17:39,188 --> 00:17:42,654
Send ten Alps towards Kurtbogazi.
Find the trace of that bastard!

57
00:17:43,288 --> 00:17:44,588
Find him!

58
00:17:45,488 --> 00:17:46,521
Abdurrahman.

59
00:17:46,821 --> 00:17:48,188
As you wish, Bey.

60
00:17:49,488 --> 00:17:51,521
My son. How are you?

61
00:17:52,554 --> 00:17:54,354
How can I be Mother?

62
00:17:57,588 --> 00:18:02,221
We have conquered the castle
but the victory is still far away.

63
00:18:42,888 --> 00:18:47,388
Until that bastard Titus is dead,
this matter will not be settled Bey.

64
00:18:47,721 --> 00:18:51,154
At first Dundar,
now my daughter-in-law Selcan.

65
00:18:51,488 --> 00:18:53,621
That degenerate is blinded by revenge.

66
00:18:53,888 --> 00:18:58,121
If given half the chance, he would
have killed Gundogdu in that very place.

67
00:18:58,754 --> 00:19:00,688
He got him without a sword
by the nomad tents.

68
00:19:03,121 --> 00:19:05,121
I wonder who's turn is it now?

69
00:19:06,454 --> 00:19:07,521
How is Selcan?

70
00:19:08,121 --> 00:19:09,454
Her condition is dire Bey.

71
00:19:10,388 --> 00:19:13,288
Poor girl sacrificed herself for Gundogdu.

72
00:19:15,088 --> 00:19:16,721
May God be pleased of her.

73
00:19:20,388 --> 00:19:22,254
What have we been through Hayme?

74
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:26,388
As Selcan said once...

75
00:19:26,854 --> 00:19:30,854
...everything started when Ertugrul
brought Halime.

76
00:19:31,388 --> 00:19:33,121
Only with her presence...

77
00:19:34,088 --> 00:19:36,688
...did we realize the purulence in
our nomad tent.

78
00:19:39,621 --> 00:19:44,521
The lid blindfolded us was lift off
thanks to our daughter Halime.

79
00:19:45,654 --> 00:19:48,454
If God permits, we will get rid of this
purulence Bey.

80
00:19:48,721 --> 00:19:50,688
When our daughter Selcan recovers...

81
00:19:51,354 --> 00:19:55,621
...the peace we are longing for will come
to our nomad group, if God permits.

82
00:19:56,754 --> 00:19:59,188
After you safely return.

83
00:20:00,454 --> 00:20:03,388
If God permits, Hanim. If God permits.

84
00:20:03,688 --> 00:20:08,654
The proxy of our nomad group and the seal
of Seigniory is entrusted to you.

85
00:20:10,121 --> 00:20:13,188
And the glory of our nomad group is
entrusted to you as well.

86
00:20:13,254 --> 00:20:15,188
Do not worry, Bey.

87
00:20:17,188 --> 00:20:19,221
As long as I have you, I will never worry.

88
00:20:26,721 --> 00:20:28,654
It is time to take the road.

89
00:20:32,888 --> 00:20:34,621
Let me help you Bey.

90
00:20:50,321 --> 00:20:51,554
Bey.

91
00:20:51,888 --> 00:20:53,521
We will have a grandchild.

92
00:20:55,554 --> 00:20:57,354
Selcan is pregnant.

93
00:21:21,288 --> 00:21:23,321
I increased the security precautions
in the nomad group.

94
00:21:24,154 --> 00:21:26,554
However, if you do not have to,
do not go out of the nomad group.

95
00:21:26,688 --> 00:21:28,321
Do not worry about us Ertugrul.

96
00:21:29,854 --> 00:21:32,154
Your duty is heavy.

97
00:21:33,588 --> 00:21:36,154
Come back honorably, that is enough.

98
00:21:44,854 --> 00:21:49,821
The day you were shot by that traitor
still haunts me...

99
00:21:53,788 --> 00:21:58,588
...you falling to my arms,
sacrificing yourself for me.

100
00:22:00,654 --> 00:22:03,354
Everyone sacrifices their life for
their beloved, Ertugrul.

101
00:22:04,888 --> 00:22:06,621
Selcan did the same thing.

102
00:22:08,221 --> 00:22:11,788
After all the things she did to you,
you are still protecting Selcan.

103
00:22:13,354 --> 00:22:17,488
We all know indeed, her heart is
still pure.

104
00:22:18,421 --> 00:22:21,321
After all she broke bread with your
mother and father.

105
00:22:27,621 --> 00:22:29,854
Titus will never give up Ertugrul.

106
00:22:34,321 --> 00:22:39,254
He even tried to kill a little baby
to take the revenge of his brother Bisol.

107
00:22:41,621 --> 00:22:43,521
He is blinded by it.

108
00:22:44,654 --> 00:22:47,154
He got so out of hand that he even
harms women.

109
00:22:50,121 --> 00:22:51,588
I am sure he will come after you.

110
00:22:52,754 --> 00:22:56,554
I wish he would come and get
his destruction.

111
00:22:58,188 --> 00:22:59,454
He will.

112
00:22:59,521 --> 00:23:00,721
I have no doubt.

113
00:23:08,388 --> 00:23:11,321
Do not feel sad for that our wedding day
brought such pain to us, Ertugrul.

114
00:23:14,888 --> 00:23:17,688
Every day you came back home is
my wedding day.

115
00:23:20,454 --> 00:23:22,754
I only want you to be careful, alright?

116
00:23:32,554 --> 00:23:37,254
As long as you keep praying for my well
being, what is there to fret?

117
00:23:43,388 --> 00:23:44,754
Godspeed.

118
00:23:45,688 --> 00:23:47,421
May sun not burn your skin.

119
00:23:48,188 --> 00:23:49,754
May rain not make you cold.

120
00:23:51,288 --> 00:23:53,254
Nothing may get in your way.

121
00:23:55,008 --> 00:23:58,441
May it be easy to come back
to your nomad group.

122
00:24:25,908 --> 00:24:27,075
Stop, son.

123
00:24:27,341 --> 00:24:29,508
That load will not fit into that
sack anymore.

124
00:24:29,575 --> 00:24:31,641
Are we not going to take
the chest with us, Efendi?

125
00:24:32,475 --> 00:24:33,641
Do I have your permission?

126
00:24:34,375 --> 00:24:35,675
Come in.

127
00:24:38,275 --> 00:24:39,275
<i>Peace be upon you.</i>

128
00:24:39,341 --> 00:24:41,075
<i>And peace be upon you.</i>

129
00:24:47,441 --> 00:24:50,375
It is time to leave your nomad group, son.

130
00:24:51,541 --> 00:24:53,308
Will I be able to see you again?

131
00:24:53,441 --> 00:24:55,375
Surely one day our paths will cross.

132
00:24:56,041 --> 00:24:57,441
From Andalusia to here...

133
00:24:57,508 --> 00:24:59,375
...many place resided us.

134
00:24:59,875 --> 00:25:01,575
Many opened their hearts to us.

135
00:25:02,141 --> 00:25:06,408
However, none of them were as peaceful
as the Kayi nomad group.

136
00:25:06,475 --> 00:25:08,208
May God grants you blessings.

137
00:25:09,241 --> 00:25:10,475
Thank you.

138
00:25:10,975 --> 00:25:13,275
We had received you in our hard times.

139
00:25:14,141 --> 00:25:16,341
I witnessed your hard times.

140
00:25:16,541 --> 00:25:17,541
However...

141
00:25:18,175 --> 00:25:21,475
...as a seed sprouted to a new life...

142
00:25:21,908 --> 00:25:26,208
...I witnessed the pain of a new
resurrection in the Islam world.

143
00:25:28,041 --> 00:25:31,275
From now on, everything is in your
hands Ertugrul.

144
00:25:31,675 --> 00:25:33,208
You should know that.

145
00:25:33,575 --> 00:25:35,575
You become the ones who is entrusted
a mission...

146
00:25:36,375 --> 00:25:39,375
...may God give power to you
and your nomad group.

147
00:25:39,608 --> 00:25:41,441
May God let nothing to stand in your way.

148
00:25:42,341 --> 00:25:43,441
Amen.

149
00:25:44,975 --> 00:25:46,575
And may nothing stands in your way
as well.

150
00:26:02,575 --> 00:26:04,108
You forgot to take the chest, Efendi.

151
00:26:07,441 --> 00:26:12,141
As I have told you before son,
the deposit have found its owner now.

152
00:26:15,141 --> 00:26:17,075
For the moment do not open it.

153
00:26:17,675 --> 00:26:20,608
When the day comes, it will open for you.

154
00:26:23,875 --> 00:26:25,408
May I ask what is it inside?

155
00:26:27,041 --> 00:26:30,475
We could say that it is a little gift
which will help you when you feel the...

156
00:26:31,041 --> 00:26:36,575
...draught or swelter while carrying out
the task that your fate bring upon you.

157
00:26:39,675 --> 00:26:41,508
It is somewhat hard to open the chest.

158
00:26:43,408 --> 00:26:47,008
It has always been hard to breach
the shell and reach to the jewel inside.

159
00:26:47,608 --> 00:26:49,175
When the time comes...

160
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:52,241
...you will breach the shell and reach
the jewel inside.

161
00:27:45,508 --> 00:27:46,608
Gokce Hatun...

162
00:27:48,008 --> 00:27:49,908
...I trust Selcan in your hands.

163
00:27:51,241 --> 00:27:54,475
Not only her but our baby, as well.

164
00:27:57,908 --> 00:27:59,975
May nothing stand in your way,
Gundogdu Bey.

165
00:28:00,608 --> 00:28:02,141
Be at ease.

166
00:28:02,908 --> 00:28:05,208
Both Halime and Mother Hayme are here
with us.

167
00:28:08,208 --> 00:28:10,875
If God permits, my sister will get better
until your return.

168
00:28:11,541 --> 00:28:12,608
If God permits.

169
00:28:13,075 --> 00:28:14,275
Safely.

170
00:28:19,441 --> 00:28:21,641
Halime Sultan...

171
00:28:22,508 --> 00:28:23,675
...welcome to our community.

172
00:28:24,175 --> 00:28:25,508
You came with graces.

173
00:28:26,375 --> 00:28:27,975
Thank you, Gundogdu Bey.

174
00:28:28,541 --> 00:28:30,441
I am honored by your words.

175
00:28:31,475 --> 00:28:33,308
Do not worry about Selcan Hatun.

176
00:28:33,541 --> 00:28:35,108
May God let nothing stand in your way.

177
00:28:35,641 --> 00:28:37,908
Amen. Safely.

178
00:29:14,508 --> 00:29:16,408
How is your wife, brother?

179
00:29:22,641 --> 00:29:24,141
We are going far.

180
00:29:25,508 --> 00:29:27,941
If you wish so, you should not
leave her alone.

181
00:29:28,674 --> 00:29:30,208
How can it be, brother?

182
00:29:31,441 --> 00:29:34,541
While Oghuzs fighting to death
with Mongols...

183
00:29:35,541 --> 00:29:38,875
...we should be united, we should
stand as one, like my father says.

184
00:29:39,875 --> 00:29:43,175
No doubt, I too will come to show him
that I support him.

185
00:29:47,908 --> 00:29:49,175
Is everything ready, Bamsi?

186
00:29:50,275 --> 00:29:52,208
We, Bey, we are always ready.

187
00:30:40,675 --> 00:30:42,208
-My brave boy.
-Brother.

188
00:30:42,575 --> 00:30:44,008
I trust this land to you.

189
00:32:23,641 --> 00:32:28,375
My grand grandfather Gokalp,
gave this ring to his son, Kizil Buga.

190
00:32:29,375 --> 00:32:32,541
And Kizil Buga, gave this to my father
Kaya Alp.

191
00:32:34,341 --> 00:32:36,575
And now I am trusting this to you.

192
00:32:38,641 --> 00:32:40,675
I may never come back.

193
00:32:41,408 --> 00:32:46,641
When the time comes, it is your duty
to give this to nomad group's Bey.

194
00:32:50,675 --> 00:32:53,041
This, firstly is your duty, Bey.

195
00:34:33,575 --> 00:34:37,675
May nothing stand in your way.

196
00:34:37,908 --> 00:34:43,275
May nothing stand in your way.

197
00:34:44,341 --> 00:34:47,608
May God let nothing stand in your way.

198
00:34:47,941 --> 00:34:51,475
May nothing stand in your way.

199
00:35:17,575 --> 00:35:20,275
I should not have spoken with you
that way, sister.

200
00:35:22,075 --> 00:35:23,941
However wrong it may be...

201
00:35:24,608 --> 00:35:26,175
...sinful it may be...

202
00:35:27,275 --> 00:35:29,475
...I should not have act that way to you.

203
00:35:33,175 --> 00:35:36,075
I should have respected you, sister.

204
00:35:37,041 --> 00:35:39,308
Forgive me sister, please.

205
00:35:46,075 --> 00:35:48,341
You are a part of me.

206
00:35:52,041 --> 00:35:54,541
Look, we will be blessed with a newborn.

207
00:35:56,141 --> 00:35:58,075
Sister you have to live.

208
00:36:00,108 --> 00:36:04,941
For Gundogdu Bey, for your baby,
you have to live sister.

209
00:36:07,308 --> 00:36:09,875
Do not give up sister, please.

210
00:36:30,541 --> 00:36:31,575
Gokce.

211
00:36:39,075 --> 00:36:44,075
It seems that Gundogdu has forgiven her,
as our Suleyman Shah.

212
00:36:44,608 --> 00:36:46,141
Thank God.

213
00:36:51,908 --> 00:36:55,375
From now on, everything will be
as good as the old days, Gokce.

214
00:37:00,241 --> 00:37:01,375
From now on...

215
00:37:02,175 --> 00:37:07,008
...we should not shadow our own happiness
which we earned by our bloody tears...

216
00:37:07,075 --> 00:37:11,975
...by blaming neither ourselves,
nor others.

217
00:37:16,175 --> 00:37:18,908
If God permits, my daughter Selcan will
get better as well.

218
00:37:18,975 --> 00:37:20,508
If God permits.

219
00:37:26,008 --> 00:37:29,241
Let us hope the pain in our nomad group
will come to an end, if God permits.

220
00:37:34,675 --> 00:37:36,941
You do understand me, do you not
my daughter?

221
00:39:17,408 --> 00:39:18,908
It is me, Titus.

222
00:39:19,041 --> 00:39:20,408
I could not realize that it is you,
my Lord.

223
00:39:21,508 --> 00:39:23,441
-Did you bring what I asked for?
-Yes, my Lord.

224
00:39:40,875 --> 00:39:41,941
Is there any news?

225
00:39:42,041 --> 00:39:46,008
Master Titus, Suleyman and his sons will
meet Oghuz Beys in...

226
00:39:46,075 --> 00:39:47,875
...a caravansary by the Euphrates.

227
00:39:48,108 --> 00:39:49,375
Oghuz Beys you say?

228
00:39:51,408 --> 00:39:53,075
What is happening, Cornelius?

229
00:39:53,175 --> 00:39:54,641
What are these Turks trying to do?

230
00:39:55,108 --> 00:39:58,341
It is said that they are seeking
an alliance against Mongols, my Lord.

231
00:40:01,641 --> 00:40:03,141
Damn them.

232
00:40:04,975 --> 00:40:06,608
Is the ambassador of Seljuk coming,
as well?

233
00:40:06,675 --> 00:40:09,508
Yes, my Lord. Aleaddin Keykubat
will send...

234
00:40:09,975 --> 00:40:12,241
...Ata Bey Celaleddin Karatay himself.

235
00:40:13,441 --> 00:40:17,508
This alliance is not solely
against the Mongols...

236
00:40:17,641 --> 00:40:21,341
...but against the crusader army as well.

237
00:40:22,241 --> 00:40:23,575
These Muslims.

238
00:40:26,241 --> 00:40:31,475
If they learn to act as one for once, this
will be the end of all of us, Cornelius.

239
00:40:32,375 --> 00:40:33,908
I cannot let that happen.

240
00:40:34,975 --> 00:40:38,541
Suleyman and his offspring must never
reach the caravansary.

241
00:40:38,908 --> 00:40:40,241
What do you want me to do, my Lord?

242
00:40:40,408 --> 00:40:41,641
Go at once.

243
00:40:42,341 --> 00:40:44,308
I will follow Ertugrul.

244
00:40:44,941 --> 00:40:46,208
Gather the men.

245
00:42:38,941 --> 00:42:40,141
Sun is about to set.

246
00:42:41,075 --> 00:42:42,441
Let us spend the night here.

247
00:43:14,241 --> 00:43:15,541
Have a look around.

248
00:43:15,675 --> 00:43:17,041
As you wish, Bey.

249
00:43:51,075 --> 00:43:52,541
We were in the roads for days, brother.

250
00:43:57,475 --> 00:43:58,941
You kept your silence.

251
00:44:00,875 --> 00:44:02,208
This saddens all of us.

252
00:44:03,175 --> 00:44:04,875
However, father is the most worried.

253
00:44:06,675 --> 00:44:08,108
Get yourself together.

254
00:44:09,508 --> 00:44:11,341
Our duty has much importance.

255
00:44:13,141 --> 00:44:14,441
You are right.

256
00:44:15,975 --> 00:44:17,975
You are right brother...

257
00:44:18,108 --> 00:44:20,375
...however I cannot stop myself
from thinking about Selcan.

258
00:44:21,441 --> 00:44:24,141
And that heathen called Titus, as well.

259
00:44:27,141 --> 00:44:29,475
Our maker will grant Selcan to you.

260
00:44:30,041 --> 00:44:31,175
I believe that.

261
00:44:32,041 --> 00:44:33,241
And Titus.

262
00:44:34,541 --> 00:44:36,141
The one gives him to you will be me.

263
00:44:37,108 --> 00:44:41,141
You will punish him for what he did to
both Dundar and your wife.

264
00:44:44,375 --> 00:44:46,008
Trust me.

265
00:44:49,341 --> 00:44:51,175
Father wishes to speak with us.

266
00:44:52,308 --> 00:44:53,575
Let us go.

267
00:45:05,508 --> 00:45:07,175
Be seated my sons.

268
00:45:18,008 --> 00:45:19,475
It is safe here, Bey.

269
00:45:23,641 --> 00:45:26,008
Since Titus has not attach us...

270
00:45:27,375 --> 00:45:29,975
...he must be planning a trap for us
which we cannot escape.

271
00:45:31,208 --> 00:45:32,341
You are right father.

272
00:45:33,108 --> 00:45:35,541
He learned the cost of directly
attacking us.

273
00:45:36,675 --> 00:45:38,575
He will set the trap near caravansary.

274
00:45:39,108 --> 00:45:42,108
If God permits, we will reach caravansary
at sundown tomorrow.

275
00:45:42,275 --> 00:45:44,408
If God permits, son. If God permits.

276
00:45:46,141 --> 00:45:47,141
We are few in numbers.

277
00:45:47,875 --> 00:45:49,108
Our duty is crucial.

278
00:45:50,008 --> 00:45:53,041
We can surprise him by taking a road that
no one can anticipate.

279
00:46:07,008 --> 00:46:09,208
This time he should be the one
falling our trap, father.

280
00:46:11,541 --> 00:46:14,041
We need to finish this job without
any bloodshed.

281
00:46:14,541 --> 00:46:18,408
But the most important thing is,
reaching caravansary in one piece.

282
00:46:40,908 --> 00:46:41,941
Ointment is ready.

283
00:46:42,675 --> 00:46:45,241
Eygis told me to put it on before
it loose its efficiency.

284
00:46:47,408 --> 00:46:49,675
I will do it Halime. Put it there.

285
00:47:00,408 --> 00:47:01,675
Mother.

286
00:47:03,041 --> 00:47:04,075
Halime.

287
00:47:06,408 --> 00:47:09,275
Wait daughter, I have things to say.

288
00:47:15,908 --> 00:47:17,975
We would like to enlarge the rug house.

289
00:47:18,041 --> 00:47:19,608
It seems that, from Damascus to Konya...

290
00:47:19,675 --> 00:47:23,275
...everyone is asking for our rugs,
our textiles.

291
00:47:23,941 --> 00:47:25,075
Praise be.

292
00:47:25,408 --> 00:47:31,208
Even the merchants coming from Constantine
are asking for our goods.

293
00:47:31,941 --> 00:47:35,475
We will send Wild Demir to Aleppo to
buy new handlooms.

294
00:47:35,975 --> 00:47:37,408
This will cost us, Mother.

295
00:47:37,941 --> 00:47:41,408
We will be using the loot that we obtained
from crusaders.

296
00:47:43,141 --> 00:47:45,008
There is one more thing.

297
00:47:46,575 --> 00:47:49,341
Both Suleyman Shah and me...

298
00:47:50,008 --> 00:47:53,341
...want you to become
the head of the rug house.

299
00:48:01,241 --> 00:48:04,008
So our wedding preparations should
continue as well, Mother.

300
00:48:04,075 --> 00:48:05,675
Of course, it will continue daughter.

301
00:48:05,908 --> 00:48:08,108
We should not be cut away from our
entertainment, right?

302
00:48:08,408 --> 00:48:10,208
You are right. Of course.

303
00:48:10,441 --> 00:48:13,641
If God permits, my daughter Selcan
also will get better.

304
00:48:24,208 --> 00:48:26,575
I am saying that the peace will come to
our nomad group however...

305
00:48:29,375 --> 00:48:33,375
...I do not know what is this
grayness I feel, Halime.

306
00:48:37,208 --> 00:48:39,041
Simply, you are weary Mother.

307
00:48:40,108 --> 00:48:41,375
Get some rest.

308
00:48:42,408 --> 00:48:45,275
Wild Demir and I will prepare
for the rug house.

309
00:48:45,341 --> 00:48:46,675
Do not worry, Mother.

310
00:48:49,675 --> 00:48:51,408
Thank you, my dear daughter.

311
00:48:53,408 --> 00:48:54,908
Thank you.

312
00:48:56,641 --> 00:48:58,508
Let us put the ointment on her at once.

313
00:49:14,441 --> 00:49:15,575
You both, go there.

314
00:49:16,341 --> 00:49:17,675
And you, return to your spots.

315
00:49:21,475 --> 00:49:23,675
Put two more men behind those bushes.

316
00:49:25,041 --> 00:49:26,941
First act should be done by them.

317
00:49:27,341 --> 00:49:29,641
After that, second archer unit will
attack to the Alps.

318
00:49:30,208 --> 00:49:31,308
And finally cavalcade.

319
00:49:31,375 --> 00:49:32,675
Yes, my Lord.

320
00:49:33,275 --> 00:49:34,608
You all, return to your spots.

321
00:51:25,308 --> 00:51:26,441
What happened?

322
00:51:26,908 --> 00:51:29,475
There is no one here.
What do you wish us to do?

323
00:51:34,308 --> 00:51:36,508
Get ready. We are going to caravansary.

324
00:51:38,241 --> 00:51:39,975
Get ready. We are leaving.

325
00:51:40,908 --> 00:51:42,308
Run Ertugrul.

326
00:51:42,641 --> 00:51:44,341
Let us see how far you can go.

327
00:51:48,341 --> 00:51:51,475
What if Banu Cicek fall for a brave man.
What can you do?

328
00:51:54,641 --> 00:52:00,041
As a wild flower like that withering,
would bees leave it alone, brother?

329
00:52:02,375 --> 00:52:07,141
Let us say bees become scared seeing that
Banu is so lively...

330
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:13,408
...what if her father gives his daughter
to a brave...

331
00:52:13,941 --> 00:52:17,141
...ball of fire man then what can you do?

332
00:52:19,475 --> 00:52:20,875
You know what.

333
00:52:25,541 --> 00:52:26,908
What a foreboder man you are!

334
00:52:26,975 --> 00:52:28,675
-What did I say?
-Damn the things you said.

335
00:52:29,441 --> 00:52:30,875
Brother Turgut...

336
00:52:32,908 --> 00:52:37,908
...this shy rooster do not stop
splitting hairs. He will do nothing.

337
00:52:38,408 --> 00:52:42,541
If he is fallen for her, we need to nudge
this lazy brother a little.

338
00:52:44,341 --> 00:52:46,108
You are a wicked man.

339
00:52:50,575 --> 00:52:53,175
I wonder what will Titus do when he
realizes he cannot spot us.

340
00:52:53,941 --> 00:52:56,375
Surely, he will follow us until we reach
to caravansary.

341
00:52:56,641 --> 00:52:58,641
This will be the last trace
he will follow, father.

342
00:54:22,041 --> 00:54:24,141
Live long, Suleyman Shah.

343
00:54:24,208 --> 00:54:26,108
Live long, Ertugrul Bey.

344
00:54:26,241 --> 00:54:28,275
Live long, Gundogdu Bey.

345
00:54:28,341 --> 00:54:32,475
May your hands that collapsed the castle
of crusaders, will never bare hardship.

346
00:55:00,208 --> 00:55:01,208
Suleyman.

347
00:55:02,008 --> 00:55:03,541
Korkut.

348
00:55:09,208 --> 00:55:10,541
Welcome to you all.

349
00:55:10,908 --> 00:55:11,975
Thank you.

350
00:55:12,241 --> 00:55:14,541
Welcome, Suleyman Bey.

351
00:55:15,008 --> 00:55:17,608
The great Beys of Oghuz, thank you.

352
00:55:18,241 --> 00:55:20,141
Praise be.

353
00:55:20,241 --> 00:55:24,008
It seems that you overpowered
the crusaders with your brave sons.

354
00:55:25,308 --> 00:55:29,375
They have to wait forever to be able to
gather their army back together again...

355
00:55:29,675 --> 00:55:31,574
...to overpower us.

356
00:55:35,541 --> 00:55:37,408
I am not saying this because
I am their uncle.

357
00:55:38,941 --> 00:55:41,975
As long as you have these
brave sons of yours,...

358
00:55:42,241 --> 00:55:44,875
...you can sweep over their armies
as well.

359
00:55:45,375 --> 00:55:47,375
Thank you, Korkut. Thank you.

360
00:55:48,341 --> 00:55:50,641
How is my sister Hayme?

361
00:55:51,141 --> 00:55:52,541
She sent her regards.

362
00:55:53,075 --> 00:55:54,641
Wishes you well, Korkut.

363
00:55:59,941 --> 00:56:01,275
Korkut Bey is here as well.

364
00:56:03,141 --> 00:56:05,575
It is time to talk then.

365
00:56:07,541 --> 00:56:09,541
Should we ask for Banu Cicek for you?

366
00:56:09,975 --> 00:56:11,508
Are you trying to drive me mad?

367
00:56:12,641 --> 00:56:14,141
Make way.

368
00:56:15,341 --> 00:56:17,108
Come, let us toy with him.

369
00:56:17,575 --> 00:56:20,108
Do not. We have things to do.

370
00:56:23,475 --> 00:56:24,941
We did not forget that...

371
00:56:25,008 --> 00:56:28,275
...our son Ertugrul saved us from a major
disaster, Suleyman Bey.

372
00:56:29,175 --> 00:56:30,475
Thank you.

373
00:56:32,608 --> 00:56:34,875
<i>Suleyman Shah is not here with us.</i>

374
00:56:34,941 --> 00:56:38,308
<i>Because he collaborated with crusaders.</i>

375
00:56:38,375 --> 00:56:39,441
<i>Lie!</i>

376
00:56:40,041 --> 00:56:42,941
<i>This ignoble, casts aspersions on us.</i>

377
00:56:43,141 --> 00:56:45,908
<i>The ones sow discord among Islam world...</i>

378
00:56:46,275 --> 00:56:50,441
<i>...the ones who are trying to keep us</i>
<i>from pray in Jerusalem...</i>

379
00:56:50,908 --> 00:56:57,008
<i>...now are trying to shatter Seljuk Empire</i>
<i>by set Oghuzs against one another.</i>

380
00:56:57,141 --> 00:57:03,075
<i>This waste of a man who is trusted armies</i>
<i>by Selahaddin Ayyubi's descendants...</i>

381
00:57:03,575 --> 00:57:05,875
<i>...is standing before you</i>
<i>as a crusader army dog.</i>

382
00:57:27,541 --> 00:57:28,875
<i>May peace be upon you.</i>

383
00:57:28,941 --> 00:57:29,941
<i>And peace be upon you.</i>

384
00:57:30,008 --> 00:57:31,175
<i>And peace be upon you.</i>

385
00:57:31,608 --> 00:57:36,108
Suleyman Shah came with his sons Gundogdu
and Ertugrul, Ata Bey.

386
00:57:37,941 --> 00:57:42,241
Thank God we heard about the conquest
that you have done with your sons...

387
00:57:42,308 --> 00:57:43,575
...Suleyman Shah.

388
00:57:43,641 --> 00:57:47,408
Our Sultan, Aleaddin Keykubat asked me
to bring his regards...

389
00:57:47,475 --> 00:57:51,875
...as well as his greetings to you
and your sons.

390
00:57:53,008 --> 00:57:54,875
Thank you, Ata Bey Karatay.

391
00:57:55,441 --> 00:57:57,541
Give him my regards as well.

392
00:57:58,575 --> 00:58:04,241
May he accept the gift that we brought him
for his marriage with Damascus queen.

393
00:58:05,641 --> 00:58:07,175
Thank you, Suleyman Shah.

394
00:58:08,008 --> 00:58:11,175
Without your efforts,
our Sultan's wedding...

395
00:58:11,241 --> 00:58:12,475
...would not be taking place.

396
00:58:13,075 --> 00:58:16,608
Our Sultan's love and respect will not
leave your side.

397
00:58:17,075 --> 00:58:18,475
May God bless you.

398
00:58:19,508 --> 00:58:23,908
Go ahead get seated, get some rest.
Let them bring ayran to us.

399
00:58:23,975 --> 00:58:26,075
Let my nieces catch their breath.

400
00:58:26,241 --> 00:58:27,441
Go ahead.

401
00:58:52,475 --> 00:58:53,941
Ertugrul has come.

402
00:58:54,175 --> 00:58:56,975
White bearded men will be receiving
Ertugrul this evening.

403
00:59:40,375 --> 00:59:41,608
Hatuns.

404
00:59:45,075 --> 00:59:46,408
I have things to say.

405
00:59:48,175 --> 00:59:50,508
You are working for days without a break.

406
00:59:51,241 --> 00:59:53,575
Some of you weaves cloths,
some of you weaves rugs.

407
00:59:54,308 --> 00:59:57,208
Some of you stitches clothing for Alps,
some of you prepares armor.

408
00:59:57,608 --> 00:59:58,875
However...

409
00:59:59,008 --> 01:00:04,108
...even after we bought handlooms,
we did not make as much goods as intended.

410
01:00:05,041 --> 01:00:06,508
I know you are weary.

411
01:00:07,508 --> 01:00:12,241
But what will we do if we take
migration path up again?

412
01:00:13,208 --> 01:00:17,575
What is more, the clothing and armor that
we made for Alps are not enough.

413
01:00:18,575 --> 01:00:20,275
What I want to say Hatuns...

414
01:00:21,208 --> 01:00:23,375
...until Suleyman Shah returns
to our nomad group...

415
01:00:24,075 --> 01:00:26,408
...we have to reach the numbers
he gave us.

416
01:00:27,375 --> 01:00:30,641
I am willing to teach my job to our
willing young women.

417
01:00:31,675 --> 01:00:35,441
If we increase our numbers,
we will be able to make more goods.

418
01:00:40,041 --> 01:00:41,575
Do you understand me, Hatuns?

419
01:00:41,641 --> 01:00:45,341
-Understood, Halime.
-Understood.

420
01:00:46,175 --> 01:00:48,175
Thank you Hatuns. May is be easy.

421
01:00:48,241 --> 01:00:49,675
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

422
01:00:55,908 --> 01:00:58,475
It is clear that she will be the
Mother of our nomad group in the future.

423
01:00:58,975 --> 01:01:01,875
She is already aching to be in her
mother in law's favor.

424
01:01:37,141 --> 01:01:38,441
How is your back, father?

425
01:01:40,975 --> 01:01:44,941
It is nothing compared to facing
a sore like Kurtoglu, son.

426
01:01:45,675 --> 01:01:47,508
We pull through many sores.

427
01:01:49,575 --> 01:01:53,008
Hearing that from Konya Palace to
Cairo Palace...

428
01:01:53,908 --> 01:01:59,941
...everyone praising you,
brings me honor son.

429
01:02:01,175 --> 01:02:03,141
Your abilities and...

430
01:02:03,675 --> 01:02:05,508
...intelligence surpassed me tenfold.

431
01:02:06,575 --> 01:02:07,941
Not at all, father.

432
01:02:08,208 --> 01:02:09,875
It should surpass, son.

433
01:02:10,441 --> 01:02:16,241
You are the only one among us
that has Bey vision and state vision.

434
01:02:17,975 --> 01:02:21,575
Upon seeing your abilities...

435
01:02:22,375 --> 01:02:24,041
...I realized this fact as well.

436
01:02:25,475 --> 01:02:32,175
You showed us that our nomad group
will live on.

437
01:02:33,308 --> 01:02:34,941
After I am gone...

438
01:02:35,341 --> 01:02:37,675
...you will shoulder the burden of
our nomad group.

439
01:02:38,308 --> 01:02:39,308
Father.

440
01:02:39,375 --> 01:02:41,408
Your brother knows this as well, son.

441
01:02:41,941 --> 01:02:43,241
He embraced it.

442
01:02:44,208 --> 01:02:46,275
You should prepare yourself to this,
as well.

443
01:02:49,441 --> 01:02:53,075
It is certain that we will return to our
nomad group with a new mission, son.

444
01:02:54,008 --> 01:02:56,308
May God favor us.

445
01:02:57,908 --> 01:02:59,075
Amen, father.

446
01:03:10,341 --> 01:03:11,541
Then what happened Konur Alp?

447
01:03:12,075 --> 01:03:14,508
Banu Cicek did not marry that man
as well Turgut.

448
01:03:14,875 --> 01:03:16,141
Gosh.

449
01:03:16,241 --> 01:03:20,641
Among many candidates, why does not she
pick one?

450
01:03:21,175 --> 01:03:23,241
It is said that she has fallen
for someone.

451
01:03:23,441 --> 01:03:24,675
Gosh.

452
01:03:25,208 --> 01:03:26,908
I wonder who is that man?

453
01:03:30,108 --> 01:03:31,641
Have you seen Ertugrul Bey?

454
01:03:33,075 --> 01:03:34,541
Here he comes.

455
01:03:42,475 --> 01:03:43,508
What did Dogan do?

456
01:03:44,641 --> 01:03:47,275
He is tending the servants of caravansary,
Bey.

457
01:03:47,508 --> 01:03:51,608
Like you said brother, do not be surprised
if there is a crusader among them.

458
01:03:52,008 --> 01:03:55,275
Bamsi and I will take a look around
as well.

459
01:03:55,475 --> 01:03:58,408
Let us see if that waste of a man
Titus came so far out here.

460
01:04:00,575 --> 01:04:01,641
Be careful.

461
01:04:01,875 --> 01:04:03,908
-As you wish, Bey.
-As you wish, Bey.

462
01:04:10,108 --> 01:04:11,375
Turgut.

463
01:04:12,108 --> 01:04:14,541
I do not like this Afsin Bey, brother.

464
01:04:15,308 --> 01:04:21,275
Especially when they do things in secret
with Bey, I became very irritated.

465
01:04:22,275 --> 01:04:23,508
Irritated, brother.

466
01:04:27,241 --> 01:04:29,275
Let us mind our business, brother.

467
01:04:31,341 --> 01:04:32,508
Come with me.

468
01:04:41,941 --> 01:04:43,341
You will go in alone.

469
01:04:45,308 --> 01:04:46,608
Why are you not coming in, Afsin?

470
01:04:47,341 --> 01:04:49,241
Our rank is not sufficient, Bey.

471
01:04:52,275 --> 01:04:54,008
Go ahead.

472
01:05:20,329 --> 01:05:21,363
May peace be upon you.

473
01:05:22,429 --> 01:05:25,363
And peace be upon you.
Son of Suleyman Shah, Ertugrul.

474
01:05:25,529 --> 01:05:26,896
Be seated.

475
01:05:35,396 --> 01:05:36,929
You asked for me.

476
01:05:37,529 --> 01:05:38,563
Yes, son.

477
01:05:39,163 --> 01:05:43,496
We asked for you to see the face of the
one we have been hearing about.

478
01:05:44,163 --> 01:05:47,996
To understand the mind of the one we
have seen before us.

479
01:05:52,963 --> 01:05:54,063
I am listening.

480
01:05:55,529 --> 01:05:57,196
You have been in and out of many wars...

481
01:05:58,229 --> 01:05:59,963
...go through many hardships...

482
01:06:00,163 --> 01:06:02,563
...meeting enemies, seeing the world.

483
01:06:03,829 --> 01:06:06,429
Tell me, what is the state of the world.

484
01:06:09,763 --> 01:06:11,296
World is in a crisis.

485
01:06:13,029 --> 01:06:16,363
On one hand there is crusaders,
on the other Mongols...

486
01:06:17,163 --> 01:06:20,863
...and then there is us, fighting a war
over Anatolia.

487
01:06:22,163 --> 01:06:26,129
All in power knows that
dominating the Anatolia...

488
01:06:27,363 --> 01:06:29,829
...means dominating the world.

489
01:06:31,829 --> 01:06:34,796
Then, which one of you will succeed
in your opinion?

490
01:06:40,863 --> 01:06:43,196
Crusaders came here with a great force.

491
01:06:43,796 --> 01:06:47,263
When they departed they had the purpose of
taking hold of the Jerusalem.

492
01:06:48,196 --> 01:06:49,229
However...

493
01:06:50,229 --> 01:06:53,029
...every time they arrived here
they forgot their purpose and...

494
01:06:53,096 --> 01:06:54,363
...went for the loot instead.

495
01:06:56,063 --> 01:06:57,229
Mongols...

496
01:06:57,496 --> 01:06:58,963
...they want to come to Anatolia...

497
01:07:00,429 --> 01:07:03,429
...however they are like a hungry wolf
attacking the herd.

498
01:07:04,129 --> 01:07:05,563
They go back once they are full.

499
01:07:06,896 --> 01:07:08,496
Then us?

500
01:07:09,296 --> 01:07:11,063
What do you say about us?

501
01:07:14,229 --> 01:07:18,896
We first came to Anatolia under the
leadership of Tugrul and Cagri Bey's.

502
01:07:19,529 --> 01:07:21,929
Then Sultan Alparslan...

503
01:07:22,329 --> 01:07:25,363
...with battle of Manzikent,
opened the doors of Anatolia for us.

504
01:07:27,129 --> 01:07:28,296
However...

505
01:07:29,763 --> 01:07:31,063
...our unity is broken down.

506
01:07:33,363 --> 01:07:35,029
If we can unite...

507
01:07:35,763 --> 01:07:37,163
...and provide justice...

508
01:07:38,496 --> 01:07:40,229
...Anatolia will be ours.

509
01:07:41,796 --> 01:07:45,296
Son, if you wish these lands to be ours...

510
01:07:48,329 --> 01:07:50,096
...you need to listen to me carefully.

511
01:07:51,863 --> 01:07:55,896
And not even once, you will leave our
advices aside.

512
01:08:38,463 --> 01:08:41,129
Even my weapon sheds rubies...

513
01:08:41,563 --> 01:08:45,829
...as long as I am alive I will fight
for this purpose.

514
01:08:47,196 --> 01:08:51,229
And I will wave the flag of justice once
more in Anatolia.

515
01:09:14,015 --> 01:09:15,115
Gokce.

516
01:09:18,548 --> 01:09:20,082
Gokce.

517
01:09:22,215 --> 01:09:23,915
I brought you supper.

518
01:09:43,148 --> 01:09:45,282
Gokce, have I done something to
break your heart?

519
01:09:56,548 --> 01:09:58,148
My sister was always ambitious.

520
01:10:00,448 --> 01:10:02,148
She committed many sins.

521
01:10:04,482 --> 01:10:06,448
But she was right at one thing.

522
01:10:08,182 --> 01:10:09,582
Ertugrul.

523
01:10:12,682 --> 01:10:16,048
When Ertugrul saved you from crusaders and
brought you to our nomad tent...

524
01:10:18,548 --> 01:10:21,648
...she told me that nothing will be
the same ever again.

525
01:10:25,515 --> 01:10:26,915
She was right.

526
01:10:33,015 --> 01:10:35,048
Maybe if you did not came
to this nomad tent...

527
01:10:36,148 --> 01:10:38,982
...this would not happen to my sister,
Halime.

528
01:10:42,015 --> 01:10:44,015
Are you still talking about Ertugrul,
Gokce?

529
01:10:46,582 --> 01:10:49,382
I thought that you were done with this
matter after everything that happened.

530
01:10:49,948 --> 01:10:50,948
I am done.

531
01:10:52,915 --> 01:10:54,348
While suffering this pain...

532
01:10:54,882 --> 01:10:57,282
...while ripping Ertugrul
out of my heart...

533
01:10:58,082 --> 01:11:00,582
...I did not do this for your sake,
Halime.

534
01:11:02,282 --> 01:11:03,615
I did it for Ertugrul.

535
01:11:06,082 --> 01:11:07,348
For his happiness.

536
01:11:10,682 --> 01:11:13,248
I hope that you will cherish him
the way he deserves.

537
01:11:19,548 --> 01:11:21,282
I will take my leave then.

538
01:12:11,115 --> 01:12:12,115
Mother.

539
01:12:12,182 --> 01:12:14,615
<i>O God, let Your Peace come upon</i>
<i>Muhammad and the family of Muhammad.</i>

540
01:12:17,982 --> 01:12:19,382
Mother, are you alright?

541
01:12:22,182 --> 01:12:26,348
May God favor us daughter,
I had a dream, I am alright.

542
01:12:26,948 --> 01:12:28,382
May God favor us.

543
01:12:29,482 --> 01:12:31,348
Wait Mother, I will give you some water.

544
01:12:39,615 --> 01:12:41,115
Take it Mother, drink.

545
01:12:50,082 --> 01:12:52,948
I have been seeing the same dream
in the last couple of days.

546
01:12:53,915 --> 01:12:57,515
A river, flows thick and fast.

547
01:12:59,615 --> 01:13:01,048
However.

548
01:13:01,482 --> 01:13:02,915
However what, Mother?

549
01:13:06,082 --> 01:13:09,315
However, Suleyman...

550
01:13:42,448 --> 01:13:45,048
Master Titus, there is no way to go in.

551
01:13:46,315 --> 01:13:47,582
How about the kitchen?

552
01:13:48,148 --> 01:13:50,215
Unfortunately we were not able to
poison the cauldrons.

553
01:13:50,415 --> 01:13:53,448
They are pouring the food out and make it
once more in their own ways.

554
01:13:53,882 --> 01:13:56,415
Korkut Bey brought women from his
nomad tent to prepare food.

555
01:13:57,482 --> 01:14:00,282
Then, are we able to learn
what they are discussing inside?

556
01:14:00,415 --> 01:14:03,915
Of course, my Lord.
Our inside man will come to inform you.

557
01:14:21,215 --> 01:14:24,348
Are you talking about fighting against
Mongols, Karatay?

558
01:14:25,215 --> 01:14:29,248
To protect the state of Aleaddin,
do you want to sacrifice us...

559
01:14:29,315 --> 01:14:31,348
...while there is so few of us
left already?

560
01:14:31,415 --> 01:14:35,982
The state of Sultan Aleaddin, opened
his arms to the fullest to embrace Oghuzs.

561
01:14:36,415 --> 01:14:40,015
Bad blood in the past has been dealt with.

562
01:14:40,215 --> 01:14:41,282
To what cost?

563
01:14:41,615 --> 01:14:43,482
There is blood shed all over us.

564
01:14:44,582 --> 01:14:47,682
What happens when Sultan Aleaddin
abdicate the throne?

565
01:14:49,048 --> 01:14:51,915
Similar to old days,
who knows what the new Sultan...

566
01:14:52,215 --> 01:14:54,382
...after acquiring the throne,
will do to us?

567
01:14:59,948 --> 01:15:01,282
Hayat Bey is right.

568
01:15:01,348 --> 01:15:04,148
Every hardship falls on us, nomads.

569
01:15:04,948 --> 01:15:07,315
We will fight to our last breath.

570
01:15:07,948 --> 01:15:10,648
However, no one stood beside us
in our hard times.

571
01:15:10,882 --> 01:15:12,048
He is right.

572
01:15:12,648 --> 01:15:14,348
What Hayat Bey said is right.

573
01:15:14,415 --> 01:15:16,115
We are always the ones that left behind.

574
01:15:27,482 --> 01:15:28,648
Beys...

575
01:15:29,882 --> 01:15:31,215
...elders of my kin...

576
01:15:32,548 --> 01:15:34,182
...I agree with you
from the bottom of my heart.

577
01:15:36,082 --> 01:15:37,682
We were belittled for being nomads.

578
01:15:38,948 --> 01:15:42,548
Both Ayyubis and Farisis acted this way.

579
01:15:44,115 --> 01:15:45,448
We were pushed around.

580
01:15:46,882 --> 01:15:49,615
However, Sultan Aleaddin is different.

581
01:15:50,648 --> 01:15:52,382
Like Ata Bey said...

582
01:15:53,082 --> 01:15:54,615
...he opened his arms to embrace
all of us.

583
01:15:56,415 --> 01:16:00,015
Great Beys of my kin
whom I know their bravery well...

584
01:16:01,148 --> 01:16:04,148
...there is no one among ourselves
who does not know how many Alps...

585
01:16:04,215 --> 01:16:07,082
...fallen martyr fighting against
crusaders.

586
01:16:08,448 --> 01:16:10,182
We learned many things in this war.

587
01:16:10,515 --> 01:16:14,182
We would like to hear what you learned
from you, Ertugrul Bey.

588
01:16:17,648 --> 01:16:21,015
Every problem starts from within.

589
01:16:22,115 --> 01:16:23,482
I say...

590
01:16:23,548 --> 01:16:25,882
...we should not be the mite that
gnaw to this almighty sycamore...

591
01:16:25,948 --> 01:16:28,615
...which has been planted
by Alparslan himself.

592
01:16:29,682 --> 01:16:34,515
If this almighty sycamore falls over,
we all will get buried by it.

593
01:16:35,482 --> 01:16:40,248
Our voyage that started in Otuken, will
come to an end in this beautiful land.

594
01:16:50,382 --> 01:16:51,515
Beys...

595
01:16:52,415 --> 01:16:55,415
...against Mongol demons coming
in waves from east...

596
01:16:56,582 --> 01:17:00,015
...and crusaders rise deviously
from west...

597
01:17:01,215 --> 01:17:07,048
...our job is to unite as one
under the holy coat of Ahmet Yesevi.

598
01:17:08,415 --> 01:17:10,615
If we cannot become united as one...

599
01:17:12,215 --> 01:17:14,648
...we would be betraying both
our voyage from Otuken...

600
01:17:15,615 --> 01:17:18,415
...and the heritage of Yesevi.

601
01:17:24,515 --> 01:17:26,115
May almighty God...

602
01:17:26,548 --> 01:17:29,315
...preserves us from
disobeying our prophet's legacy.

603
01:17:33,682 --> 01:17:37,215
For that, great Beys of Oghuzs...

604
01:17:39,048 --> 01:17:41,482
...I say it is time to unite as one.

605
01:17:43,115 --> 01:17:45,215
Islam world is shattered.

606
01:17:46,882 --> 01:17:48,682
The resurrection fire that we scorch...

607
01:17:49,482 --> 01:17:54,182
...will spread to the world and a new Turk
seigniory will come to light.

608
01:18:03,548 --> 01:18:04,682
Now...

609
01:18:05,448 --> 01:18:09,148
...I say that we unite against Mongols...

610
01:18:10,182 --> 01:18:12,348
...and close our ranks in Anatolia.

611
01:18:26,315 --> 01:18:28,115
Do you agree to this unity Beys?

612
01:19:07,248 --> 01:19:08,915
Suleyman Shah...

613
01:19:09,482 --> 01:19:12,415
...history will write this things that
you have done one day.

614
01:19:21,015 --> 01:19:23,648
We are throwing ourselves into
the fire again.

615
01:20:27,215 --> 01:20:29,948
Up until today, this degenerate entrapped
us time and time again.

616
01:20:32,482 --> 01:20:35,215
Now it is his turn to be entrapped.

617
01:20:39,215 --> 01:20:44,215
God is the most favorable of the ones
that set traps.

618
01:20:48,682 --> 01:20:50,448
Come on.

619
01:21:04,448 --> 01:21:07,348
I know that we have no other choice
as well, father.

620
01:21:08,082 --> 01:21:13,382
However, is it right to go against
Mongols, solely with swords at hand?

621
01:21:15,582 --> 01:21:17,115
You talk about a unity.

622
01:21:17,615 --> 01:21:19,415
What if the unity breaks down?

623
01:21:20,348 --> 01:21:22,882
Then, what can we do all alone?

624
01:21:25,382 --> 01:21:27,915
I feel your worries as well, son.

625
01:21:28,615 --> 01:21:32,515
However Kayis destiny is already set.

626
01:21:33,515 --> 01:21:35,082
Our way points towards Anatolia.

627
01:21:36,282 --> 01:21:38,282
And there is no way back from it.

628
01:21:40,448 --> 01:21:43,115
May God favor us.

629
01:21:46,248 --> 01:21:47,648
Thank you, brother.

630
01:22:00,615 --> 01:22:01,915
Bey.

631
01:22:02,915 --> 01:22:04,182
Bey you were right.

632
01:22:04,448 --> 01:22:06,048
Titus is here.

633
01:22:07,282 --> 01:22:10,248
He came by the caravansary
with his knights.

634
01:22:11,115 --> 01:22:12,382
We confirmed his location.

635
01:23:48,282 --> 01:23:50,048
Finally.

636
01:23:50,415 --> 01:23:52,048
Our paths came across.

637
01:23:52,582 --> 01:23:56,215
Let us see if you are as brave as you are
going against women and children.

638
01:23:57,415 --> 01:24:01,248
At least I am not as stupid as going
against the whole world as you do.

639
01:24:01,615 --> 01:24:07,182
As long as you follow God's will,
no matter if you are alone Titus.

640
01:24:08,315 --> 01:24:11,648
But a lost demon like you would not
be able to understand that.

641
01:24:13,015 --> 01:24:17,882
I will collapse the order that you created
by treachery and betrayal, around you.

642
01:24:18,215 --> 01:24:20,515
Me and my kin.

643
01:24:20,682 --> 01:24:22,148
So do we.

644
01:24:22,682 --> 01:24:25,282
We will not stop until you go back
the hell you came from.

645
01:24:25,582 --> 01:24:28,915
We all came from God,
we will return to him.

646
01:24:30,015 --> 01:24:33,148
But soon you will see the hell
you will go back to.

647
01:24:33,982 --> 01:24:35,915
Come and send me there then.

648
01:28:47,315 --> 01:28:48,648
Kill me Turk.

649
01:28:58,882 --> 01:29:00,515
You are the destiny of my brother.

650
01:29:17,415 --> 01:29:19,582
Victory will be God's.

651
01:29:22,048 --> 01:29:25,448
We do not doubt that, praise God.

652
01:29:48,248 --> 01:29:49,415
We have a long way ahead.

653
01:29:49,982 --> 01:29:51,248
Thank you, brother.

654
01:29:52,015 --> 01:29:54,582
We should not keep the ones missing us
waiting any longer.

655
01:31:04,182 --> 01:31:05,482
Thank you.

656
01:31:12,082 --> 01:31:14,615
Upon seeing you people will think that
you are not a new bride...

657
01:31:14,682 --> 01:31:16,482
...but a mourning widower, Halime Sultan.

658
01:31:18,882 --> 01:31:19,882
What is wrong?

659
01:31:20,415 --> 01:31:22,115
Why are you so sad?

660
01:31:24,515 --> 01:31:25,648
Gokce.

661
01:31:33,015 --> 01:31:35,148
Tell me. What happened?

662
01:31:38,348 --> 01:31:40,348
She still talks about Ertugrul.

663
01:31:42,682 --> 01:31:44,148
How about her heart?

664
01:31:48,148 --> 01:31:50,215
The wound of her heart poisons her tongue.

665
01:31:53,515 --> 01:31:56,382
I do not know how long
this will go on, Aykiz.

666
01:31:58,482 --> 01:32:00,915
She told Ertugrul that he is
as her brother however...

667
01:32:01,115 --> 01:32:03,115
Her heart will get cold, do not worry.

668
01:32:05,448 --> 01:32:10,482
While trying to put out the fire in her
heart, she went through a lot of pain.

669
01:32:12,648 --> 01:32:14,182
Finally, Selcan.

670
01:32:15,648 --> 01:32:19,215
There is no one that she can confide
in as well.

671
01:32:21,882 --> 01:32:25,015
Do not give her a hard time.
It will all pass.

672
01:32:26,948 --> 01:32:28,882
What if it does not happen
the way you think?

673
01:32:31,315 --> 01:32:33,148
Then what can we do, Aykiz?

674
01:32:35,182 --> 01:32:38,182
How can we face one another
in this nomad tent?

675
01:32:50,315 --> 01:32:51,582
Good bye.

676
01:32:52,215 --> 01:32:53,348
Thank you, Afsin.

677
01:32:54,648 --> 01:32:58,015
After you set your nomad tent, I will come
as soon as possible, if God permits.

678
01:33:20,182 --> 01:33:21,515
Afsin Bey.

679
01:33:23,382 --> 01:33:24,948
I will tell you one thing.

680
01:33:25,948 --> 01:33:27,082
Do tell.

681
01:33:28,448 --> 01:33:31,082
Say the thing you have been keeping
to yourself and be at ease.

682
01:33:34,015 --> 01:33:35,982
Father of lineage Yigit.

683
01:33:38,315 --> 01:33:39,582
Did you kill him?

684
01:33:49,948 --> 01:33:51,115
Bamsi.

685
01:33:56,082 --> 01:33:57,582
I am sorry, Bey.

686
01:33:58,148 --> 01:34:00,348
I could not get a hold of my tongue again.

687
01:34:02,115 --> 01:34:04,382
We were always one of those who
had a duty, Bamsi.

688
01:34:06,015 --> 01:34:08,548
May God help us in our new duty.

689
01:34:10,148 --> 01:34:12,348
May God grant you to be the ones...

690
01:34:13,382 --> 01:34:15,882
...not hurting their loved ones
but helping their lives prosper.

691
01:34:37,148 --> 01:34:39,082
Good bye.

692
01:34:52,248 --> 01:34:53,282
Father.

693
01:34:56,015 --> 01:34:57,248
Father.

694
01:34:58,015 --> 01:34:59,615
We can stay in caravansary, if you wish.

695
01:34:59,982 --> 01:35:01,215
We can leave tomorrow.

696
01:35:01,482 --> 01:35:03,082
I am alright, alright.

697
01:35:03,615 --> 01:35:05,882
We have much to do in our nomad group.

698
01:35:06,482 --> 01:35:10,648
It became our destiny to migrate again
before the end of summer.

699
01:36:09,148 --> 01:36:14,215
It is said, Korkut Ata from Hayat tribe,
one man stands tall.

700
01:36:15,615 --> 01:36:16,982
Korkut Ata says...

701
01:36:19,315 --> 01:36:25,215
...in those times, when a boy does not
shed blood they would not name him.

702
01:36:26,415 --> 01:36:28,348
And they would not give their ranks
to Beys.

703
01:36:29,148 --> 01:36:30,382
-Gosh!
-Gosh!

704
01:36:31,115 --> 01:36:34,315
When the boys ride horses, wield swords,
shoot arrows...

705
01:36:35,148 --> 01:36:36,682
...be brave as you are...

706
01:36:37,148 --> 01:36:40,448
...then they would become subjected to
the training of becoming an Alp.

707
01:36:41,148 --> 01:36:44,448
Do you think we do deserve such training,
as Suleyman Shah says, Wild Demir?

708
01:36:46,982 --> 01:36:48,348
Of course my brave boy.

709
01:36:49,215 --> 01:36:52,482
Did you not open the way to us
to go into the castle of crusaders?

710
01:36:54,148 --> 01:36:55,982
Did you not stand against enemies
in Aleppo?

711
01:36:56,548 --> 01:37:02,682
Did you not protect our ancestors' honor
by not being fooled by their threats?

712
01:37:03,882 --> 01:37:05,582
Dundar...

713
01:37:05,882 --> 01:37:10,048
...you, did you not save your father,
your family and your nomad group...

714
01:37:10,448 --> 01:37:15,115
...by standing against the cowardly Titus?

715
01:37:16,081 --> 01:37:18,915
If you did not, Kurtoglu would unite...

716
01:37:19,948 --> 01:37:22,581
...with him and kill your father and
your brothers.

717
01:37:26,315 --> 01:37:27,982
I did not do anything, Wild Demir.

718
01:37:28,282 --> 01:37:29,648
Only...

719
01:37:32,215 --> 01:37:33,515
Dundar.

720
01:37:34,182 --> 01:37:36,882
The best quality of an Alp is humility.

721
01:37:37,982 --> 01:37:40,282
As I see it, thank God you both have it.

722
01:37:41,182 --> 01:37:46,315
Humility, honesty, hospitality,
generosity.

723
01:37:48,282 --> 01:37:50,915
An Alp should not act arrogantly.

724
01:37:52,182 --> 01:37:54,182
Should not think himself as superior.

725
01:37:56,282 --> 01:37:59,482
Kara Polat should own his mind's sword.

726
01:38:00,615 --> 01:38:02,348
Should act without pity.

727
01:38:04,682 --> 01:38:07,582
One cannot become an Alp if he is fond
of riches.

728
01:38:08,515 --> 01:38:11,015
Though he cannot be a man as well,
anyhow.

729
01:38:12,115 --> 01:38:15,115
The one you call Alp should learn to tan
somebody's hide from his ancestors.

730
01:38:15,382 --> 01:38:17,382
He should stand a man on his horse.

731
01:38:18,182 --> 01:38:21,082
Children plays with mind's sword,
but man must own it.

732
01:38:23,448 --> 01:38:28,315
He should protect other's order.
He should not know lies.

733
01:38:29,382 --> 01:38:33,648
Shedding blood is not enough to become
an Alp.

734
01:38:38,148 --> 01:38:43,448
Virtue and merit are the most important
things that made one an Alp, indeed.

735
01:38:44,548 --> 01:38:46,948
And of course, a sword.

736
01:38:50,115 --> 01:38:55,082
An Alps needs a sword as virtuous and
skillful as he is.

737
01:38:57,148 --> 01:38:58,948
I am making these swords for you.

738
01:39:00,415 --> 01:39:04,648
As I did for Suleyman Shah, Gundogdu
and Ertugrul.

739
01:39:11,482 --> 01:39:13,615
Where did Suleyman Shah go, Wild Demir?

740
01:39:14,382 --> 01:39:18,615
There is no way to run from the Mongols
that chase us for years, brave boy.

741
01:39:19,348 --> 01:39:23,648
It is high time to make a unity and
stop this calamity.

742
01:39:25,648 --> 01:39:29,548
We either win and live or we die.

743
01:39:30,415 --> 01:39:31,882
There is no other way.

744
01:39:37,982 --> 01:39:39,215
Is that the reason of them leaving?

745
01:39:40,182 --> 01:39:41,415
Yes, son.

746
01:39:42,682 --> 01:39:44,615
May God help them.

747
01:39:45,615 --> 01:39:47,282
Amen.

748
01:39:59,397 --> 01:40:01,463
Should we rest here for a while, Bey?

749
01:40:03,730 --> 01:40:05,663
You take me for an old man.

750
01:40:07,563 --> 01:40:08,830
How could that be, father?

751
01:40:09,963 --> 01:40:12,363
You could take all of us down,
with God's help.

752
01:40:14,397 --> 01:40:16,330
We said it for the horses.

753
01:41:13,897 --> 01:41:14,897
Bey.

754
01:41:16,363 --> 01:41:19,330
Let’s go cross the river first and
take a look around.

755
01:41:21,730 --> 01:41:22,730
Hurry.

756
01:42:09,397 --> 01:42:11,230
I am thankful to you, my God.

757
01:42:12,730 --> 01:42:16,697
Thank you for giving us a heart to stop
and listen to all this beauty...

758
01:42:16,897 --> 01:42:22,530
...you have created and to embrace them
with good sight.

759
01:42:24,530 --> 01:42:27,297
Thank You for letting me
follow Your way for a lifetime...

760
01:42:27,497 --> 01:42:31,997
...and permitting me to raise
my brave sons.

761
01:42:34,797 --> 01:42:39,763
Thank You, for giving me a short and
pleasant life, like the sound...

762
01:42:39,863 --> 01:42:45,330
...of this nightingale,
united with my sons' mother.

763
01:43:48,630 --> 01:43:50,697
Father.

764
01:43:51,997 --> 01:43:53,263
Father!

765
01:43:57,563 --> 01:43:58,563
Father!

766
01:44:05,630 --> 01:44:06,630
Father!

767
01:45:43,763 --> 01:45:45,730
I trust our nomad group in your hands.

768
01:45:47,830 --> 01:45:51,363
Protect our nomad group...

769
01:45:51,463 --> 01:45:54,963
...from all the kinds of evil,
like you do for your wives...

770
01:45:56,563 --> 01:45:57,997
...and for your children.

771
01:46:13,530 --> 01:46:15,963
Obey the laws of our ancestor Oghuz...

772
01:46:17,197 --> 01:46:20,996
...and the state of Seljuk
that came from it.

773
01:46:23,430 --> 01:46:24,497
Be one and lively.

774
01:48:23,230 --> 01:48:24,230
Bey?

775
01:48:26,863 --> 01:48:27,963
Bey.

776
01:48:34,363 --> 01:48:35,397
Bey!

777
01:50:14,630 --> 01:50:16,797
Rest in peace, Bey.

778
01:50:45,597 --> 01:50:47,797
I intend to say my prayers
for God's sake.

779
01:50:48,463 --> 01:50:49,963
To pray for the Meyyit.

780
01:50:50,830 --> 01:50:51,830
For a man...

781
01:51:40,363 --> 01:51:42,363
What are your thoughts on the deceased?

782
01:51:42,430 --> 01:51:43,563
He was a good person.

783
01:51:43,930 --> 01:51:46,263
-Do you give your blessings?
-Yes, we do.

784
01:51:46,830 --> 01:51:49,597
-Do you?
-Yes, we do.

785
01:51:49,930 --> 01:51:52,263
-Do you?
-Yes, we do.

786
01:58:12,530 --> 01:58:18,897
<i>Brave sons of Kayi,</i>
<i>may God, Who turns night into day...</i>

787
01:58:19,197 --> 01:58:22,663
<i>...day into sun, bare witness,</i>
<i>this is not a tale.</i>

788
01:58:24,530 --> 01:58:28,497
<i>The story I will tell is the real story</i>
<i>of a blessed way and voyage...</i>

789
01:58:29,563 --> 01:58:34,863
<i>...that will reach from Otuken mountains</i>
<i>to Anatolia...</i>

790
01:58:35,330 --> 01:58:38,730
<i>...from Anatolia to many conquests</i>
<i>and conquerors.</i>

791
01:58:39,597 --> 01:58:44,297
<i>This story is the story that made</i>
<i>our Bey, Suleyman Shah...</i>

792
01:58:44,397 --> 01:58:47,197
<i>...amongst many other Beys.</i>

793
01:58:48,330 --> 01:58:51,597
<i>Suleyman Shah is the one who</i>
<i>never turned his back on humility...</i>

794
01:58:51,697 --> 01:58:54,430
<i>...bravery, chivalry...</i>

795
01:58:54,530 --> 01:58:57,630
<i>...and God's justice,</i>
<i>the one who knew that...</i>

796
01:58:57,730 --> 01:59:01,397
<i>...being united as one means to exist...</i>

797
01:59:01,497 --> 01:59:05,863
<i>...the one who is the gem of</i>
<i>the Turkic history...</i>

798
01:59:05,963 --> 01:59:10,197
<i>...to be told by our ancestors</i>
<i>until today...</i>

799
01:59:10,397 --> 01:59:13,863
<i>...and from this day forth.</i>

800
01:59:17,330 --> 01:59:21,563
<i>From Oghuz Khan to today,</i>
<i>from today to many Sultans...</i>

801
01:59:21,663 --> 01:59:26,930
<i>...and many conquests, he is a victorious</i>
<i>Bey in our glorious history...</i>

802
01:59:29,730 --> 01:59:35,263
<i>...who has been entrusted to carry on</i>
<i>yesterday's history to tomorrow’s.</i>

803
01:59:37,363 --> 01:59:40,763
<i>He protected this trust with his own life.</i>

804
01:59:43,363 --> 01:59:45,563
<i>He never let his nomad group go</i>
<i>hungry or be alone.</i>

805
01:59:46,663 --> 01:59:49,263
<i>He never turned his back on God's justice.</i>

806
01:59:50,197 --> 01:59:53,197
<i>He always knew his God</i>
<i>and his ancestor's laws.</i>

807
01:59:54,697 --> 01:59:59,230
<i>He fought but never lost either</i>
<i>to his own self or to the enemy.</i>

808
02:00:00,997 --> 02:00:04,363
<i>Neither the betrayals that came from</i>
<i>the ones who are close to him nor...</i>

809
02:00:04,430 --> 02:00:07,597
<i>...other hardships were able to</i>
<i>turn him away from his ways.</i>

810
02:00:08,863 --> 02:00:13,297
<i>Neither the cruelty of a tyrant, nor the</i>
<i>power of the heathen could stop him.</i>

811
02:00:16,730 --> 02:00:19,563
<i>For him, Kayi was entrusted to him</i>
<i>by his children.</i>

812
02:00:20,997 --> 02:00:25,397
<i>He carried that trust to this day,</i>
<i>as a Bey, as a Shah...</i>

813
02:00:25,497 --> 02:00:29,597
<i>...as Suleyman Shah, so that you could be</i>
<i>conquerors so that...</i>

814
02:00:29,863 --> 02:00:35,597
<i>...there will be no cruelty or</i>
<i>tyrants left, with God's permission.</i>

815
02:00:37,297 --> 02:00:40,463
<i>Now that trust is yours.</i>

816
02:00:41,397 --> 02:00:44,730
<i>It is a debt. It is our burden.</i>

817
02:00:45,763 --> 02:00:47,897
<i>May God bestow his graces upon him.</i>

818
02:00:49,430 --> 02:00:52,897
<i>And may God put you in the way</i>
<i>of many conquests, if God permits.</i>

819
02:00:54,263 --> 02:00:58,563
<i>Do not forget my children,</i>
<i>you are his descendants.</i>

820
02:00:59,697 --> 02:01:03,663
<i>Never forget that</i>
<i>you are his descendants.</i>

821
02:03:56,763 --> 02:03:58,230
My Shah went to heaven.

822
02:04:30,763 --> 02:04:35,630
Father? Where is my father?
Where is my father, brother?

823
02:04:39,663 --> 02:04:41,230
You have to be strong.

824
02:04:43,597 --> 02:04:45,597
Your father would’ve also wished for that.

825
02:06:00,497 --> 02:06:04,763
Let him, let him feel the pain of his
closest friend, Aykiz.

826
02:06:22,663 --> 02:06:23,663
Is it true?

827
02:07:21,797 --> 02:07:22,797
Ertugrul.

828
02:07:55,797 --> 02:07:57,563
My father died in peace.

829
02:08:00,580 --> 02:08:02,480
Any other way would not suit him,
anyhow.

830
02:08:08,647 --> 02:08:10,113
May he rest in peace.

831
02:08:13,213 --> 02:08:14,647
May God give you longevity.

832
02:08:16,913 --> 02:08:18,247
Before he died...

833
02:08:20,480 --> 02:08:21,980
...he asked us to go to Anatolia.

834
02:08:24,180 --> 02:08:27,013
A hard and painful life starts
once more, Halime.

835
02:08:27,513 --> 02:08:28,613
It is okay.

836
02:08:30,580 --> 02:08:32,880
Wherever you are
is my home, after all.

837
02:08:34,613 --> 02:08:37,113
And where my nomad group goes is
my homeland as well.

838
02:08:38,980 --> 02:08:40,213
May God keep you beside me.

839
02:09:01,847 --> 02:09:05,513
If God gives us a son,
we should name him Suleyman.

840
02:09:07,913 --> 02:09:10,313
For that blessed man's sacred memory.

841
02:10:29,013 --> 02:10:30,080
Bey.

842
02:10:32,347 --> 02:10:34,613
Your father tells me that
he died in peace.

843
02:10:39,247 --> 02:10:40,480
You are right, Wild Demir.

844
02:10:44,213 --> 02:10:45,213
He died in peace.

845
02:10:49,647 --> 02:10:55,180
God's and his loved ones' names
on his tongue, in peace.

846
02:11:00,613 --> 02:11:02,480
Where are we going to migrate, Bey?

847
02:11:06,647 --> 02:11:09,980
We will go to the path that Alparslan
cleared, Wild Demir.

848
02:11:12,947 --> 02:11:15,480
We can go to your father's grave and
say our prayers for him...

849
02:11:15,547 --> 02:11:17,447
...before the winter comes, can we not?

850
02:12:54,247 --> 02:12:55,247
Be seated.

851
02:13:13,147 --> 02:13:16,047
In the 99 names of almighty God,
who creates with his word...

852
02:13:16,513 --> 02:13:20,080
...and blesses our hearts with faith.

853
02:13:21,413 --> 02:13:24,213
In the name of the God.

854
02:13:33,313 --> 02:13:38,547
My Beys, my brave men,
supremes of my nomad group...

855
02:13:39,313 --> 02:13:42,013
...welcome, you bring grace to us.

856
02:13:42,113 --> 02:13:43,113
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

857
02:13:43,213 --> 02:13:44,247
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

858
02:13:49,980 --> 02:13:53,247
Our Bey, Suleyman Shah, assigned me
as a substitute before he died.

859
02:13:55,147 --> 02:13:59,247
Now, we will determine
our nomad group's future...

860
02:13:59,347 --> 02:14:01,847
...without Suleyman Shah.

861
02:14:04,413 --> 02:14:06,947
We are relieved to hear that...

862
02:14:07,513 --> 02:14:12,313
...Suleyman Shah assigned you as
a substitute, Mother Hayme.

863
02:14:12,547 --> 02:14:16,513
Otherwise, we would now
be dealing with...

864
02:14:16,613 --> 02:14:18,013
...the Bey issue and be stumbling.

865
02:14:20,113 --> 02:14:23,047
Thank you, Wild Demir. Thank you.

866
02:14:25,913 --> 02:14:29,280
In the last discussion that we had
with Oghuz Beys, it was said that...

867
02:14:29,380 --> 02:14:32,313
...the Mongols were harassing Anatolia.

868
02:14:33,380 --> 02:14:38,313
Small Mongol units started running raids
in Anatolia lands.

869
02:14:39,647 --> 02:14:43,013
It is high time to stop this
flock of cruelty.

870
02:14:45,980 --> 02:14:50,247
What can we do when there are a thousand
Mongol for every Kayi, Mother Hayme?

871
02:14:52,647 --> 02:14:54,513
Not only us Kayis...

872
02:14:55,513 --> 02:14:59,613
...all the Oghuz nomad groups know that
this alliance is the last resort.

873
02:15:01,180 --> 02:15:06,280
For that, all the Oghuz nomad groups
will gather in Anatolia.

874
02:15:07,947 --> 02:15:12,147
If we do not stand up as one, and stand
tall...

875
02:15:12,913 --> 02:15:16,147
...if we keep bad blood between us...

876
02:15:16,847 --> 02:15:20,380
...we can only be the prey for those
jackal Mongols. Prey!

877
02:15:30,080 --> 02:15:32,480
That said,
it is still good to be cautious.

878
02:15:34,480 --> 02:15:38,180
As you know, we endured many hardships
and sufferings coming to Aleppo.

879
02:15:41,380 --> 02:15:43,313
As we are free from the crusaders...

880
02:15:43,513 --> 02:15:45,980
...why would we set off on
another journey, once again?

881
02:15:48,113 --> 02:15:49,113
Son.

882
02:15:51,313 --> 02:15:57,013
Suleyman Shah made an effort
to create this alliance.

883
02:15:59,213 --> 02:16:03,280
On one hand, there are crusaders
and on the other, there are Mongols.

884
02:16:04,213 --> 02:16:07,080
A new world order is
being set as a shameless...

885
02:16:07,180 --> 02:16:10,847
...ruthless and bloody order as it is.

886
02:16:11,947 --> 02:16:16,080
In this order, we need to be together,
either with the scared dogs...

887
02:16:16,180 --> 02:16:21,280
...or with the Alps who are standing tall.

888
02:16:26,047 --> 02:16:31,380
I say, in this mortal life,
let us go against the world!

889
02:16:34,080 --> 02:16:37,647
Even if we know that only one of us
will stand in the end...

890
02:16:39,380 --> 02:16:41,113
...let us fight these tyrants.

891
02:16:49,647 --> 02:16:51,013
And I say...

892
02:16:53,280 --> 02:16:55,647
...it is high time to seek revenge
on the Mongols.

893
02:16:57,880 --> 02:17:04,080
They killed our children,
our mothers, our sisters.

894
02:17:05,013 --> 02:17:08,480
If we do not stand against them...

895
02:17:09,347 --> 02:17:11,647
...this world will not find peace.

896
02:17:15,580 --> 02:17:17,013
You are right, Wild Demir.

897
02:17:18,513 --> 02:17:22,313
Now, what do you say to
going back to the Anatolia lands...

898
02:17:23,947 --> 02:17:25,347
...that we came from, Beys?

899
02:17:48,380 --> 02:17:50,547
I do not wish to set off.

900
02:17:56,213 --> 02:17:59,347
However, headquarters
has reached a verdict...

901
02:18:02,080 --> 02:18:03,880
...and surely I must concur.

902
02:18:05,047 --> 02:18:06,047
Thank you.

903
02:18:06,613 --> 02:18:07,647
Thank you.

904
02:18:14,547 --> 02:18:19,147
Hit the drums.
It is time for us to set off on a journey.

905
02:18:20,613 --> 02:18:24,313
It is time to stop those Mongol bandits!

906
02:18:26,347 --> 02:18:28,180
May God help us all.

907
02:18:28,413 --> 02:18:29,413
Amen!

908
02:18:33,913 --> 02:18:38,913
Kayis set on the road
for the resurrection of Anatolia.

909
02:18:40,613 --> 02:18:47,180
As they set forth, history would change.

910
02:18:48,347 --> 02:18:54,880
As they set forth, cruelty would end
and justice would prevail.
