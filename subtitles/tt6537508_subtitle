1
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,020
Gattu.

2
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:28,339
Silence.
- Descends.

3
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:30,540
I come.

4
00:02:32,874 --> 00:02:34,594
What?

5
00:02:34,595 --> 00:02:36,375
We're late.

6
00:02:36,376 --> 00:02:38,936
Rakhi is the festival of brothers and sisters.

7
00:02:38,937 --> 00:02:40,427
But here.

8
00:02:40,428 --> 00:02:44,808
The girls took the opportunity to force the boys to be their brothers.

9
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:47,380
What we fear the most.

10
00:02:47,411 --> 00:02:52,911
This is when a girl or a boy forcing his family to become her brother.

11
00:02:52,952 --> 00:02:58,052
This is why it gathers early morning in the clock tower.

12
00:02:58,483 --> 00:03:01,143
But the bad news coming soon.

13
00:03:01,144 --> 00:03:03,114
Well, here's one.

14
00:03:03,115 --> 00:03:05,115
Brothers, brothers.

15
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:07,390
Calm. - What is it ?

16
00:03:07,691 --> 00:03:09,617
Bad news. - Calm down.

17
00:03:09,688 --> 00:03:12,838
Bhura, bad news, we have four victims.

18
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,570
Gattu, your friend, Mahesh, it's over for him.

19
00:03:15,571 --> 00:03:17,052
It's over, who did this?

20
00:03:17,073 --> 00:03:20,043
Your neighbor, Binny Arora.

21
00:03:22,579 --> 00:03:24,449
There she is...

22
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:26,950
This rotting our lives.

23
00:03:26,951 --> 00:03:28,551
Binny Arora.

24
00:03:28,952 --> 00:03:30,242
Jaydev, brother.

25
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:31,183
Oncle Nautiyal.

26
00:03:31,184 --> 00:03:33,284
Binny, let me go.

27
00:03:33,285 --> 00:03:35,285
I'll let you go over.

28
00:03:35,286 --> 00:03:39,196
Mr. Monga, Mr Sherma, come.

29
00:03:39,198 --> 00:03:41,208
Let me go, I have done nothing!

30
00:03:41,209 --> 00:03:45,170
First, tell me about your relationship with Ritu. - Who is Ritu?

31
00:03:45,191 --> 00:03:47,991
Grandma, he's lying, I saw!

32
00:03:47,992 --> 00:03:49,921
That's why I brought him here.

33
00:03:49,922 --> 00:03:52,572
That's it, huh?

34
00:03:52,573 --> 00:03:55,143
Stop!

35
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:59,060
Go, do come Ritu. - Yes.

36
00:04:00,142 --> 00:04:01,662
You'll know, Ritu!

37
00:04:01,663 --> 00:04:03,863
I have no connection with it.

38
00:04:06,045 --> 00:04:08,445
Here Ritu. - Approach.

39
00:04:10,447 --> 00:04:13,617
Stepdaughter, get the dish.

40
00:04:14,497 --> 00:04:15,557
Here it is.

41
00:04:15,558 --> 00:04:18,108
Come on, put it, the rakhi.

42
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:20,860
Just go.

43
00:04:20,861 --> 00:04:22,701
Ritu, do not do that, no, no.

44
00:04:22,702 --> 00:04:24,983
No, let me.

45
00:04:24,984 --> 00:04:27,719
Go for it.

46
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,987
Ritu, what are you doing?

47
00:04:28,988 --> 00:04:31,223
Give him the node. - Leave me alone.

48
00:04:31,624 --> 00:04:33,624
It's perfect.

49
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:36,000
Give her the cake.

50
00:04:36,001 --> 00:04:37,859
Take in a bit.

51
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,150
Congratulations.

52
00:04:40,151 --> 00:04:41,731
Take it. - Yes.

53
00:04:41,732 --> 00:04:43,712
No longer revolves around it.

54
00:04:43,713 --> 00:04:45,732
It's your sister now.

55
00:04:45,733 --> 00:04:46,733
Go.

56
00:04:46,734 --> 00:04:50,064
I will avenge, Binny. - Go Go !

57
00:04:50,065 --> 00:04:51,395
Uncle Nautiyal. - Yes.

58
00:04:51,396 --> 00:04:53,438
An aside, there are still three.

59
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:55,139
So prepare rakhis.

60
00:04:59,471 --> 00:05:03,251
I asked Mahesh, what's your relationship with her.

61
00:05:03,252 --> 00:05:07,979
He remained silent without a word.

62
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:10,735
The courage of your grandfather ...

63
00:05:10,736 --> 00:05:11,991
Courage...

64
00:05:11,992 --> 00:05:14,141
The courage of your grandfather ...

65
00:05:14,142 --> 00:05:17,442
He said out loud in front of everyone.

66
00:05:17,473 --> 00:05:20,273
If I do not marry Dolly, darling.

67
00:05:20,274 --> 00:05:24,426
I will destroy London with ...

68
00:05:25,781 --> 00:05:29,760
Your grandfather was a tiger.

69
00:05:29,761 --> 00:05:30,561
Grandmother...

70
00:05:30,562 --> 00:05:32,547
My husband is also a tiger.

71
00:05:32,548 --> 00:05:35,048
Just like grandfather.

72
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:37,060
I see these girls everywhere.

73
00:05:37,061 --> 00:05:38,121
In grocery stores.

74
00:05:38,122 --> 00:05:39,222
At the vegetable market.

75
00:05:39,223 --> 00:05:40,993
And in supermarkets.

76
00:05:40,994 --> 00:05:44,154
We all know that there are others before Mahesh.

77
00:05:44,155 --> 00:05:47,955
They give too much freedom to their daughters.

78
00:05:47,956 --> 00:05:53,076
They are listening to music and talking on the phone.

79
00:05:53,099 --> 00:06:00,379
Jaydev must find two good husbands for Binny and Ritu.

80
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:04,380
Otherwise, Binny will surely run away with a guy.

81
00:06:04,381 --> 00:06:05,951
Do not say that.

82
00:06:05,952 --> 00:06:09,472
The neighborhood girls are our mothers and sisters.

83
00:06:09,473 --> 00:06:11,993
Is it not, Gattu? - Oh, you think?

84
00:06:11,994 --> 00:06:16,123
I do not have a sister, but I do not want to be the brother of Binny.

85
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:17,435
Binny Arora...

86
00:06:17,436 --> 00:06:20,245
She is my childhood love.

87
00:06:20,246 --> 00:06:23,126
It is not ordinary, it's a bomb.

88
00:06:23,127 --> 00:06:26,090
I would take her to school every day.

89
00:06:26,111 --> 00:06:30,111
We played together.

90
00:06:31,143 --> 00:06:35,993
I helped her with her homework instead of playing cricket.

91
00:06:35,994 --> 00:06:38,894
We spent together all the festivals of Navratri.

92
00:06:38,895 --> 00:06:41,525
I loved him, but I could never tell him.

93
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:43,686
The girls wanted to become my sisters.

94
00:06:43,687 --> 00:06:47,337
I need love, not fraternity.

95
00:06:47,379 --> 00:06:52,079
If I do not tattoo my name Binny, I will not be Gattu.

96
00:06:52,561 --> 00:06:54,821
You missed your shot, focus.

97
00:06:54,822 --> 00:06:57,722
Bhura, I send him a friend request? - Of course.

98
00:06:57,763 --> 00:06:59,963
If evil is?

99
00:06:59,964 --> 00:07:01,844
Love takes courage.

100
00:07:01,845 --> 00:07:05,656
If Binny was my beloved, I would have done anything for her, believe me.

101
00:07:05,657 --> 00:07:07,087
Catches the ball.

102
00:07:07,088 --> 00:07:09,088
Removes this mobile.

103
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:11,240
Sorry.

104
00:07:11,241 --> 00:07:13,491
What's the score ? - Fifty.

105
00:07:13,492 --> 00:07:15,832
Do not worry, you'll see.

106
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:20,473
Here is the brother of your beloved. - ajju.

107
00:07:20,474 --> 00:07:23,304
Gattu, I can play today? - What?

108
00:07:23,305 --> 00:07:25,954
You're the captain now. - It is true ?

109
00:07:25,955 --> 00:07:27,955
Because I'm telling you.

110
00:07:27,956 --> 00:07:31,656
How to contact you if necessary?

111
00:07:31,657 --> 00:07:34,757
Give me your number. - Gattu, I have no laptop.

112
00:07:34,758 --> 00:07:37,988
Ah, you have no cell!

113
00:07:37,989 --> 00:07:39,319
So that your sister.

114
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:44,020
Brother Gattu principle, I never give my sister's number.

115
00:07:44,021 --> 00:07:46,111
It is to talk to you, what did you think?

116
00:07:46,112 --> 00:07:48,187
How to contact you?

117
00:07:48,198 --> 00:07:50,448
Brother, this is my principle.

118
00:07:50,449 --> 00:07:53,449
That's still true to your principles.

119
00:07:54,226 --> 00:07:56,626
No problem, you will warm up.

120
00:07:56,627 --> 00:07:59,027
Thank you, brother Gattu.

121
00:07:59,629 --> 00:08:03,232
He made you upset. - Do not make fun of me.

122
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:04,273
Let's go.

123
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:07,075
First we must win this game.

124
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,720
Brother.

125
00:08:11,726 --> 00:08:14,776
Why not write a letter.

126
00:08:14,777 --> 00:08:16,977
Then we'll see.

127
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:18,327
The idea is good.

128
00:08:18,351 --> 00:08:19,861
And if I get caught?

129
00:08:19,862 --> 00:08:26,662
Send an anonymous letter, no one will know.

130
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:30,740
Let me first express my feelings and then we'll see.

131
00:08:30,741 --> 00:08:31,741
Let's go.

132
00:08:41,657 --> 00:08:43,657
Hi. - Hi.

133
00:09:10,042 --> 00:09:12,622
Ajju Go, go.

134
00:09:12,623 --> 00:09:14,623
Quick.

135
00:09:18,082 --> 00:09:20,012
Mr Nautiyal.

136
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:22,000
Monsieur.

137
00:09:22,262 --> 00:09:23,652
Monsieur.

138
00:09:23,653 --> 00:09:25,592
Yes. - Because ...

139
00:09:25,593 --> 00:09:26,193
What?

140
00:09:26,194 --> 00:09:28,654
We need help. - Now ?

141
00:09:28,655 --> 00:09:29,815
Gattu.

142
00:09:29,826 --> 00:09:32,866
Hé Gattu!

143
00:09:32,867 --> 00:09:35,067
Cat is here.

144
00:09:35,785 --> 00:09:38,675
Do not worry, I got it.

145
00:09:38,676 --> 00:09:39,726
What is happening ?

146
00:09:39,727 --> 00:09:41,767
Gattu, va chez Binny.

147
00:09:41,768 --> 00:09:44,368
What? - Go home Binny.

148
00:09:44,669 --> 00:09:46,888
The grandmother is ill.

149
00:09:46,889 --> 00:09:50,289
Do not worry, I'll get the doctor.

150
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:54,391
It happened suddenly, I do not know what she has.

151
00:09:54,392 --> 00:09:56,302
It will be fine.

152
00:09:56,303 --> 00:09:58,103
Grandma, what have you?

153
00:09:58,104 --> 00:10:00,484
Grandma, say something?

154
00:10:00,505 --> 00:10:02,070
Grandma, get up.

155
00:10:02,071 --> 00:10:04,361
Gattu.

156
00:10:04,367 --> 00:10:05,217
Hé Gattu.

157
00:10:05,218 --> 00:10:07,218
Come here !

158
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:08,630
Look at my grandma?

159
00:10:08,631 --> 00:10:11,631
Come on, let it breathe.

160
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,450
Not with his hand.

161
00:10:13,451 --> 00:10:14,728
With the mouth. - Huh?

162
00:10:14,729 --> 00:10:16,429
Blow in her mouth. - My mouth ?

163
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:17,730
Mouth-to-mouth

164
00:10:17,792 --> 00:10:19,555
Well, I do. - Gattu quickly.

165
00:10:19,557 --> 00:10:20,880
Mamie. - Grandma.

166
00:10:20,881 --> 00:10:23,431
Quick, do mouth-to-mouth. - A moment.

167
00:10:23,432 --> 00:10:25,432
Go fast.

168
00:10:27,493 --> 00:10:28,323
Mamie !

169
00:10:28,324 --> 00:10:29,739
Mamie !

170
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:31,230
Mamie.

171
00:10:31,231 --> 00:10:34,371
Gattu, what are you doing? Why are you looking Binny?

172
00:10:34,372 --> 00:10:38,472
What are you doing ? Spread the word-of-mouth.

173
00:10:38,472 --> 00:10:39,912
Enter Doctor.

174
00:10:39,913 --> 00:10:41,623
Gattu, stand aside.

175
00:10:41,637 --> 00:10:43,687
Let the doctor examine her.

176
00:10:43,688 --> 00:10:46,088
I was ... - Go ahead, Doctor.

177
00:10:46,089 --> 00:10:49,589
My daughter, calm down. - Grandma.

178
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,960
Oh my God !

179
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,460
I'm sorry, sir Nautiyal.

180
00:10:57,461 --> 00:10:59,251
She died.

181
00:10:59,252 --> 00:11:01,120
You can inform the family.

182
00:11:01,121 --> 00:11:02,920
Mamie. - My sisters.

183
00:11:02,921 --> 00:11:05,821
I beg you, do not cry, where Jaydev?

184
00:11:05,822 --> 00:11:09,652
Jaydev is in Meerut for three days. - We should call him.

185
00:11:09,654 --> 00:11:11,344
Do not Cry.

186
00:11:11,345 --> 00:11:13,395
Ajju, take care of your mother.

187
00:11:13,396 --> 00:11:16,946
Ritu, come with me, we have to inform the family.

188
00:11:16,947 --> 00:11:22,798
Doctor, we need the death certificate. - Send someone to my office.

189
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:25,849
Be brave, Ms. Arora, we are with you.

190
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:27,850
Do not worry.

191
00:11:30,001 --> 00:11:33,001
Ajju, pay attention to your mother.

192
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,160
Binny. - Yes.

193
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:43,970
Gattu.

194
00:11:44,758 --> 00:11:46,518
Do not leave.

195
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:48,519
I'm afraid.

196
00:12:26,464 --> 00:12:29,416
If only this night never ends.

197
00:12:29,417 --> 00:12:32,357
You, me and the body of your granny ...

198
00:12:32,358 --> 00:12:35,458
... stay here forever.

199
00:12:36,359 --> 00:12:38,739
For I look at you ...

200
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:40,340
... look at you ...

201
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:42,342
... look at you.

202
00:12:44,353 --> 00:12:45,863
Bhur, Bhur.

203
00:12:45,864 --> 00:12:48,144
Gattu, where are you, we have a match?

204
00:12:48,145 --> 00:12:50,325
What are you saying ? Cancels the game.

205
00:12:50,326 --> 00:12:52,526
The granny Binny died.

206
00:12:52,961 --> 00:12:56,261
You forced me to play when my grandmother died.

207
00:12:56,262 --> 00:12:59,522
You must understand, Bhura, I must be near Binny.

208
00:12:59,522 --> 00:13:01,322
Take care of the team. - Well.

209
00:13:01,325 --> 00:13:03,765
But you have to win her heart. - Do not worry.

210
00:13:03,786 --> 00:13:05,256
Gattu.

211
00:13:05,257 --> 00:13:06,527
I go. - Okay.

212
00:13:06,528 --> 00:13:08,528
Calm down.

213
00:13:10,896 --> 00:13:12,146
Come. - Yes Dad.

214
00:13:12,148 --> 00:13:14,948
I want everything on the list.

215
00:13:14,949 --> 00:13:16,049
Okay. - Okay.

216
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:18,462
But how can you bring it all alone?

217
00:13:18,483 --> 00:13:21,033
Binny Take your sister with you to the market.

218
00:13:21,034 --> 00:13:23,634
It's four in the afternoon.

219
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:28,840

220
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:30,841

A second. - What?

222
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:34,341
Wait a second.

Prepare me everything.

239
00:14:17,994 --> 00:14:21,494
It'll take at least fifteen minutes. - Yes.

240
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,890
Binny.

241
00:14:23,891 --> 00:14:25,991
You have not eaten since yesterday.

242
00:14:25,992 --> 00:14:27,312
Yes.

243
00:14:27,313 --> 00:14:29,143

00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:37,190
Two special teacups.

248
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:41,860
Binny.

249
00:14:41,861 --> 00:14:45,521
I'm sorry for your grandmother.

250
00:14:45,522 --> 00:14:46,879
I am sorry.

251
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:50,920
Binny, do not worry, I'm with you.

252
00:14:50,921 --> 00:14:51,420
Okay.

253
00:14:51,421 --> 00:14:54,221
How do you say Kriya Karam in English?

254
00:14:54,222 --> 00:14:55,672
Kriy ?

255
00:14:55,678 --> 00:14:56,288
Yes...

256
00:14:56,289 --> 00:14:58,058
You flunked twice.

257
00:14:58,059 --> 00:15:01,639
I flunked once, that's all.

258
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,240
Ah !

259
00:15:03,271 --> 00:15:05,011
I spent a contest this year.

260
00:15:05,012 --> 00:15:06,642
Oh! Why this year?

261
00:15:06,643 --> 00:15:09,103
Have not you left college for two years?

262
00:15:09,104 --> 00:15:12,924
I spent contest last year.

263
00:15:12,944 --> 00:15:16,344
Binny, you know that the private is not safe.

264
00:15:16,345 --> 00:15:18,355
Listen to what I wrote on Facebook.

265
00:15:18,356 --> 00:15:19,926
My dear friends.

266
00:15:19,927 --> 00:15:23,627
I share bad news with a sad heart.

267
00:15:23,628 --> 00:15:24,828
I wrote. - Yes.

268
00:15:24,829 --> 00:15:28,899
My grandmother is dead, come all.

269
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:32,501
The funeral will be held today at 16h.

270
00:15:32,502 --> 00:15:36,402
I need your support and your prayers for the grandmother.

271
00:15:36,403 --> 00:15:37,753
For Binny Arora.

272
00:15:37,754 --> 00:15:39,254
Its good ? - Well, Binny.

273
00:15:39,255 --> 00:15:41,085
I can publish? - Of course.

274
00:15:41,086 --> 00:15:45,966
I think one thing, Binny, Can we become friends on Facebook?

275
00:15:45,968 --> 00:15:49,538
I can then share your message. - Yes we can.

276
00:15:49,549 --> 00:15:50,749
I sent? - Yes.

277
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,750
Come on, drink some tea.

278
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:56,910
The grandmother died at the right time.

279
00:15:56,911 --> 00:16:01,711
Thus ends grandmother of history and ours begins.

280
00:16:22,625 --> 00:16:27,825
Only you in my heart.

281
00:16:27,826 --> 00:16:33,226
Let's be together forever.

282
00:16:33,227 --> 00:16:38,427
Leave me a place in your heart.

283
00:16:38,428 --> 00:16:43,828
To give a chance to love.

284
00:16:43,829 --> 00:16:49,049
I pray every day for one thing.

285
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:53,050
I want to be all the time with you.

286
00:16:53,134 --> 00:16:59,934
And I promise I will never tire of you.

287
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:05,235
I want to be with you forever.

288
00:17:05,236 --> 00:17:09,836
I want to be with you forever.

289
00:17:10,637 --> 00:17:15,837
I want to be with you forever.

290
00:17:15,838 --> 00:17:21,138
I want to be with you forever.

291
00:17:36,685 --> 00:17:43,735
You were my only love, oh, the one that I really liked.

292
00:17:43,736 --> 00:17:47,326
... the only one I really liked.

293
00:17:47,327 --> 00:17:51,027
I see you in my dreams.

294
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:54,428
You are my only dream.

295
00:17:54,429 --> 00:17:57,928
My only dream.

296
00:17:57,929 --> 00:18:03,279
I'm at my best with you.

297
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:09,040
I am fascinated by you.

298
00:18:09,061 --> 00:18:14,141
I pray every day for one thing.

299
00:18:14,142 --> 00:18:19,702
I want to be all the time with you.

300
00:18:19,734 --> 00:18:25,034
And I promise I will never tire of you.

301
00:18:25,035 --> 00:18:30,335
I want to be with you forever.

302
00:18:30,336 --> 00:18:35,706
I want to be with you forever.

303
00:18:35,707 --> 00:18:41,007
I want to be with you forever.

304
00:18:41,008 --> 00:18:46,208
I want to be with you forever.

305
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:10,814
Bhura, you should have come.

306
00:19:10,815 --> 00:19:12,315
Is this jure.

307
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,770
We put grandma out of sandalwood.

308
00:19:14,771 --> 00:19:17,157
And after ? - Just Gattu Nautiyal.

309
00:19:17,158 --> 00:19:18,548
Brother.

310
00:19:18,549 --> 00:19:23,049
We can not stop telling me: Gattu, do this, do that!

311
00:19:24,173 --> 00:19:28,413
Everything rested on my shoulders.

312
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,760
You should have come, Bhura.

313
00:19:30,825 --> 00:19:35,825
I had a big order, but I will come to your wedding.

314
00:19:37,879 --> 00:19:39,879
OK, stop, stop.

315
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:44,931
Brother, you're gonna go, head high. - Of course, Bhura.

316
00:19:44,932 --> 00:19:46,608
Of course, brother.

317
00:19:46,609 --> 00:19:47,699
Listening. - Yes.

318
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,045
I take your bike. - Okay.

319
00:19:49,046 --> 00:19:50,346
I must bring Binny. - Yes.

320
00:19:50,347 --> 00:19:52,195
You agree ? - Of course, brother.

321
00:19:52,196 --> 00:19:53,659
Of course.

322
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:55,040
There she is.

323
00:19:55,067 --> 00:19:57,867
Good luck.

324
00:19:58,321 --> 00:19:59,911
It's the same thing. - Yes.

325
00:19:59,912 --> 00:20:01,912
Salut Binny.

326
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:05,170
Who is it ? - A neighbour.

327
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:10,690
One.

328
00:20:10,691 --> 00:20:11,691
What?

329
00:20:11,692 --> 00:20:13,692
One.

330
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:19,491
Take a seat.

331
00:20:19,492 --> 00:20:20,872
Why are you laughing ?

332
00:20:20,873 --> 00:20:22,273
Take a seat.

333
00:20:22,274 --> 00:20:24,574
Come, sit down. - No.

334
00:20:26,275 --> 00:20:28,275
Gattu.

335
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:31,255
Brother, I know it's annoying.

336
00:20:31,256 --> 00:20:33,116
Gattu I planned everything.

337
00:20:33,129 --> 00:20:37,117
I begin, then you, then Bhura.

338
00:20:37,118 --> 00:20:38,818
Are you kidding me ?

339
00:20:38,819 --> 00:20:40,049
Go away.

340
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:42,600
Gattu, why are you talking like that?

341
00:20:42,601 --> 00:20:44,301
You want to be captain?

342
00:20:44,302 --> 00:20:46,702
You are unable to hold a bat, Will in.

343
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:51,334
My second principle is that of non-humiliation, think about it.

344
00:20:51,335 --> 00:20:53,125
Tell him to go away otherwise ...

345
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:55,196
Go, Will in, ajju.

346
00:20:55,197 --> 00:20:56,176
He is angry.

347
00:20:56,177 --> 00:20:58,477
Penses-and well. - Va-t-on.

348
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:01,910
Okay, calm down.

349
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:07,220
She looked at me, pretending not to know me.

350
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:11,350
These are things that happen.

351
00:21:11,351 --> 00:21:13,351
OK, let's go. - Go yourself.

352
00:21:13,352 --> 00:21:14,942
Go. - Go yourself.

353
00:21:14,943 --> 00:21:18,343
It is you who begin. - I do not want, Will in.

354
00:21:18,349 --> 00:21:19,249
Come here, ajju.

355
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:22,250
I am upset and he wants me to play.

356
00:21:29,701 --> 00:21:31,101
Gattu.

357
00:21:31,102 --> 00:21:34,502
Ajju must play cricket! Aunt.

358
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:36,200
Gattu.

359
00:21:36,201 --> 00:21:38,601
Ajju should play cricket.

360
00:21:38,612 --> 00:21:41,112
Of course, ajju will play.

361
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:46,495
Binny, ajju is the team captain. - Do not try to fool me.

362
00:21:46,496 --> 00:21:49,476
Gattu, listen, I have a lot of responsibilities.

363
00:21:49,477 --> 00:21:51,077
Grandmother just died.

364
00:21:51,078 --> 00:21:52,678
Ritu will marry.

365
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:54,709
Listen ... listen.

366
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:58,390
Please, stop thinking about all these things, bye.

367
00:21:58,391 --> 00:22:02,941
Binny, have you forgotten what I did at the funeral?

368
00:22:02,942 --> 00:22:03,372
What?

369
00:22:03,373 --> 00:22:06,843
And you even offered me a juice.

370
00:22:06,844 --> 00:22:09,754
And you disturb me for that?

371
00:22:09,826 --> 00:22:11,196
Do you want a rakhi?

372
00:22:11,197 --> 00:22:14,087
I'll pass you the rakhi and finish this story.

373
00:22:14,088 --> 00:22:15,978
Binny, Binny...

374
00:22:15,979 --> 00:22:17,419
What, huh?

375
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:22,246
No, nothing, do what you want and say no more.

376
00:22:22,247 --> 00:22:24,362
All my efforts have fallen into the water.

377
00:22:24,363 --> 00:22:26,863
Go get the rakhi.

378
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:33,620
You've never been with a girl before, so I forgive you.

379
00:22:33,621 --> 00:22:38,321
Mr Gattu, love requires courage, bye.

380
00:22:38,322 --> 00:22:42,232
I am brave, Binny, tell me what I should do?

381
00:22:42,639 --> 00:22:44,639
OK I...

382
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,860
I'll spend the night at your door.

383
00:22:47,861 --> 00:22:48,726
All night long.

384
00:22:48,727 --> 00:22:49,897
Go, Will in.

385
00:22:49,898 --> 00:22:51,023
In bare feet.

386
00:22:51,024 --> 00:22:52,524
Bye.

387
00:22:52,525 --> 00:22:55,125
I'll wait outside.

388
00:22:57,737 --> 00:23:00,837
I can not find my shoes.

389
00:23:01,238 --> 00:23:05,788
I went to the bank, but not the temple.

390
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:08,190
Then...

391
00:23:08,192 --> 00:23:11,052
Dad, I bring it from home chokla.

392
00:23:11,053 --> 00:23:13,653
I have a stomach ache.

393
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:21,400
I did not enter through the back door.

394
00:23:28,695 --> 00:23:29,895
Papa.

395
00:23:29,896 --> 00:23:31,365
Do not get mad.

396
00:23:31,366 --> 00:23:32,966
I've decided...

397
00:23:32,967 --> 00:23:36,827
... to get a tattoo here on the neck.

398
00:23:36,828 --> 00:23:38,397
What?

399
00:23:38,398 --> 00:23:40,198
You want to get a tattoo?

400
00:23:40,199 --> 00:23:41,479
As Shahrukh Khan.

401
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:44,180
You know what they say about you?

402
00:23:44,181 --> 00:23:48,081
They say you're a lazy, good for nothing.

403
00:23:48,082 --> 00:23:50,732
When are you going to find you a job? - Calm down.

404
00:23:50,733 --> 00:23:52,553
His studies have been for nothing.

405
00:23:52,554 --> 00:23:53,654
Listen, my son ...

406
00:23:53,656 --> 00:23:57,852
You're going to be a public official and tattooing is frowned upon.

407
00:23:57,853 --> 00:23:59,453
Mom, I want to get tattooed.

408
00:23:59,475 --> 00:24:01,795
Five thousand rupees is what I ask.

409
00:24:01,796 --> 00:24:04,246
Five thousand rupees?

410
00:24:04,247 --> 00:24:06,717
Do you know what it's five thousand rupees?

411
00:24:06,718 --> 00:24:07,868
Five thousand rupees.

412
00:24:07,869 --> 00:24:09,869
You spend your days in the streets.

413
00:24:10,209 --> 00:24:14,709
People Lucknow change sidewalk seeing you.

414
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:15,886
Five thousand rupees.

415
00:24:15,887 --> 00:24:18,387
The son of Mohan works abroad.

416
00:24:18,388 --> 00:24:20,547
And you what do you do ?

417
00:24:20,548 --> 00:24:23,078
You live in total recklessness.

418
00:24:23,079 --> 00:24:25,888
Completely disconnected from reality.

419
00:24:25,889 --> 00:24:28,859
What are you looking for ? - I can not find my shoes.

420
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:31,320
I looked everywhere. - Look under the bed

421
00:24:31,321 --> 00:24:34,321
I looked everywhere, even under the bed

422
00:24:35,473 --> 00:24:37,353
Dad. - Yes.

423
00:24:37,354 --> 00:24:40,593
Looking for your blue shoes? - Are any there any other?

424
00:24:40,594 --> 00:24:45,694
I gave them to Bhura, his shoes were worn.

425
00:24:45,695 --> 00:24:47,755
You gave them? - Yes.

426
00:24:47,756 --> 00:24:50,186
You gave to Bhura? - Yes.

427
00:24:50,187 --> 00:24:52,867
Why not give your shoes?

428
00:24:52,868 --> 00:24:56,168
His feet, what do they have more to give it mine?

429
00:24:56,169 --> 00:24:57,419
If you had a job.

430
00:24:57,420 --> 00:25:00,195
You should have bought me a second pair.

431
00:25:00,196 --> 00:25:02,076
You really irresponsible.

432
00:25:02,077 --> 00:25:05,377
If you were a good father, you would have paid me the tattoo.

433
00:25:05,378 --> 00:25:06,878
What? - She'll scream.

434
00:25:06,879 --> 00:25:09,154
Yes, why only my shoes?

435
00:25:09,155 --> 00:25:11,049
Give her as my clothes.

436
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:14,315
I could linger in Lucknow naked.

437
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,920
Naked!

438
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:18,190
Get up.

439
00:25:18,191 --> 00:25:20,211
Get up and go out.

440
00:25:20,221 --> 00:25:22,526
Get out, out!

441
00:25:22,547 --> 00:25:24,697
I'm going out. - Outside.

442
00:25:24,698 --> 00:25:27,098
I am leaving. - Let him take his dinner.

443
00:25:27,099 --> 00:25:28,799
No, Mom, it's okay.

444
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,320
Do not come begging me. - Why you beg?

445
00:25:32,321 --> 00:25:33,441
I am leaving. - Go outside.

446
00:25:33,443 --> 00:25:37,543
I do not want to eat and I do not want to live here.

447
00:25:37,544 --> 00:25:39,664
It's your fault. - How is my fault?

448
00:25:39,666 --> 00:25:44,566
He thinks I'm scared of you. - Who will make the salad?

449
00:25:44,567 --> 00:25:47,967
I can not do everything. - I'll make the salad.

450
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,705
What is that ?

451
00:26:39,706 --> 00:26:41,710
Milk mixed with water.

452
00:26:41,711 --> 00:26:45,211
What do you say ? - Go away.

453
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:49,790
Idiot.

454
00:26:53,335 --> 00:26:56,295
Give me a cake.

455
00:26:56,299 --> 00:26:58,299
I want one too.

456
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:03,930
Another spicy.

457
00:27:03,931 --> 00:27:05,931
I want the same thing.

458
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:07,930
Revealed!

459
00:27:07,931 --> 00:27:10,131
I was there first.

460
00:27:10,182 --> 00:27:12,802
I'll pay for it, Binny, do not forget.

461
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:13,910
You think ?

462
00:27:13,911 --> 00:27:15,300
You're going to seduce me.

463
00:27:15,301 --> 00:27:18,051
By staying outside my door like an old movie.

464
00:27:18,052 --> 00:27:19,722
It's stupid.

465
00:27:19,723 --> 00:27:22,223
This is not courage.

466
00:27:24,244 --> 00:27:24,904
Binny, - What?

467
00:27:24,905 --> 00:27:26,015
Have you got a second?

468
00:27:26,016 --> 00:27:26,866
What do you want ?

469
00:27:26,867 --> 00:27:28,725
I want to talk to you in private.

470
00:27:28,726 --> 00:27:30,726
vas-y.

471
00:27:35,727 --> 00:27:38,040
Benny, I do not like chasing girls.

472
00:27:38,041 --> 00:27:40,041
I am educated.

473
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:45,300
I should have confessed long ago, but I'll do it now.

474
00:27:45,301 --> 00:27:47,181
I like you.

475
00:27:47,182 --> 00:27:50,682
You must decide what you want.

476
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:57,246
You are brave all the time, or just when you speak?

477
00:27:57,247 --> 00:27:58,932
Binny, test-moi.

478
00:27:58,933 --> 00:28:00,933
I'm ready.

479
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:04,930
Come with me.

480
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:09,320
Where are you taking me Binny? - Shut up.

481
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:19,440
That one? - Yes.

482
00:28:19,441 --> 00:28:20,511
You want my death ?

483
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:24,200
You want love, then, do it for love.

484
00:28:24,201 --> 00:28:27,011
Binny, it will strangle me. - Go ahead.

485
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:29,020
Yes OK.

486
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:44,040
Again.

487
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:51,010
Catch it. - Binny, fast, save ourselves.

488
00:28:51,021 --> 00:28:52,791
Gattu, I do not like fugitives.

489
00:28:52,792 --> 00:28:54,472
You did that at half.

490
00:28:54,473 --> 00:28:56,063
You want to declare your love?

491
00:28:56,064 --> 00:28:58,765
You see, there are so many girls here, go ahead.

492
00:28:58,766 --> 00:28:59,666
What?

493
00:28:59,667 --> 00:29:01,247
Declare your love.

494
00:29:01,268 --> 00:29:02,168
vas-y.

495
00:29:02,169 --> 00:29:03,569
Whose ?

496
00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:06,330
Binny.

497
00:29:06,331 --> 00:29:07,631
Hum.
- Comment ?

498
00:29:07,632 --> 00:29:10,082
Well. - Alright Alright.

499
00:29:10,810 --> 00:29:12,410
You.

500
00:29:12,411 --> 00:29:15,311
You're going to cause me problems.

501
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:23,110
Well, I'm going.

502
00:29:46,585 --> 00:29:48,285
Health.

503
00:29:50,865 --> 00:29:52,665
I managed ...

504
00:29:52,666 --> 00:29:54,106
It will be for next time.

505
00:29:54,107 --> 00:29:55,836
Binny, listen.

506
00:29:55,837 --> 00:29:58,767
You want me to make a declaration of love to a girl?

507
00:29:58,768 --> 00:29:59,568
Yes.

508
00:29:59,568 --> 00:30:01,588
I do this to you, huh?

509
00:30:01,589 --> 00:30:02,514
What?

510
00:30:02,515 --> 00:30:05,515
I declare my love to you.

511
00:30:06,516 --> 00:30:07,388
Binny.

512
00:30:07,389 --> 00:30:08,689
Binny, Binny.
- Bye.

513
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:10,130
Let's be friends, at least.

514
00:30:10,151 --> 00:30:12,151
Lets be friends. - Bye

515
00:30:12,152 --> 00:30:16,622
We are neighbors, we are together every day.

516
00:30:16,655 --> 00:30:20,365
What you did is nothing compared to what awaits you.

517
00:30:20,366 --> 00:30:24,366
Why are you doing this ? Even Sita did not suffer it to Rama.

518
00:30:24,387 --> 00:30:25,237
vas-y.

519
00:30:25,238 --> 00:30:27,597
Go talk to my brother on our wedding.

520
00:30:27,598 --> 00:30:30,468
If I talk to him, do not you retracted.

521
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:31,607
Not at all.

522
00:30:31,608 --> 00:30:32,958
Talk to him first.

523
00:30:32,959 --> 00:30:35,359
You are-and ... vas-y.

524
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:41,160
I have pictures in my eyes.

525
00:30:41,181 --> 00:30:43,181
This is the one without a beard?

526
00:30:43,182 --> 00:30:44,322
Ah bearded!

527
00:30:44,323 --> 00:30:46,473
Yes, it is.

528
00:30:46,474 --> 00:30:48,474
Thank you.

529
00:30:51,670 --> 00:30:53,670
Yes talk. - Nothing.

530
00:30:54,542 --> 00:30:56,662
You've for a long time with this?

531
00:30:56,663 --> 00:30:59,288
It is time to find a husband to your sister.

532
00:30:59,289 --> 00:31:01,349
That's what I do. - Yes.

533
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:03,350
Why are you worried?

534
00:31:06,999 --> 00:31:08,649
Who is he?

535
00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:09,945
That one?

536
00:31:09,946 --> 00:31:11,946
A second.

537
00:31:16,581 --> 00:31:17,771
Have you finished?

538
00:31:17,772 --> 00:31:20,472
You want to continue. - It's okay.

539
00:31:22,324 --> 00:31:25,324
Something else ? - No that's all.

540
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:28,830
I am leaving. - Yes.

541
00:31:29,201 --> 00:31:31,201
Okay.

542
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,020
Gattu, you cheated.

543
00:31:37,021 --> 00:31:38,246
No, I did not cheat.

544
00:31:38,247 --> 00:31:40,047
You asked me to talk about marriage.

545
00:31:40,048 --> 00:31:42,548
Not our wedding.

546
00:31:42,749 --> 00:31:45,119
It seeks a husband for Ritu.

547
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,520
Binny, Binny.
-Yes.

548
00:31:47,551 --> 00:31:49,821
If only you say yes .

549
00:31:49,846 --> 00:31:54,046
This will give me courage to talk to your brother.

550
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:17,290
It is obvious that something is happening.

551
00:32:17,291 --> 00:32:21,291
Did you notice something different.

552
00:32:21,292 --> 00:32:25,002
I see nothing.

553
00:32:25,003 --> 00:32:27,782
Tell me what is happening ?

554
00:32:27,783 --> 00:32:31,753
We are here together, you and me.

555
00:32:31,754 --> 00:32:35,582
How can you not see what is happening?

556
00:32:35,583 --> 00:32:39,229
You're the cause of my tears.

557
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:42,922
You're the reason for my smile.

558
00:32:42,923 --> 00:32:49,623
I'm lost in your memories.

559
00:32:50,434 --> 00:32:58,164
I also think about you all the time.

560
00:32:58,185 --> 00:33:05,685
You're the only one I think.

561
00:33:05,715 --> 00:33:13,215
I can not stop thinking about you.

562
00:33:13,517 --> 00:33:16,317
In your memories.

563
00:33:22,015 --> 00:33:25,515
We met in one place.

564
00:33:25,516 --> 00:33:29,226
Where people do not meet.

565
00:33:29,237 --> 00:33:32,987
This is the same place and the same paths.

566
00:33:32,988 --> 00:33:37,688
But nothing seems as before.

567
00:33:37,689 --> 00:33:41,539
I wonder what kind of intoxication we will have the next day.

568
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:45,386
You were a stranger, now you're mine.

569
00:33:45,387 --> 00:33:49,227
I want you to understand that, but I can not find the words.

570
00:33:49,228 --> 00:33:52,328
Tell me what is happening ?

571
00:33:52,329 --> 00:33:56,029
We are here together, you and me.

572
00:33:56,030 --> 00:34:00,030
How can you not see what is happening?

573
00:34:00,031 --> 00:34:03,803
You're the cause of my tears.

574
00:34:03,804 --> 00:34:07,341
You're the reason for my smile.

575
00:34:07,342 --> 00:34:12,972
I'm lost in your memories.

576
00:34:12,973 --> 00:34:14,973
I'm lost.

577
00:34:14,974 --> 00:34:22,474
I also think about you all the time.

578
00:34:22,616 --> 00:34:29,616
You're the only one I think.

579
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:35,425
I can not stop thinking about you.

580
00:34:35,426 --> 00:34:36,449
Gattu. - Yes.

581
00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:37,650
You know that...

582
00:34:37,651 --> 00:34:40,630
Your family and mine live in the same neighborhood.

583
00:34:40,631 --> 00:34:42,431
I know since childhood.

584
00:34:42,432 --> 00:34:43,532
I am lucky.

585
00:34:43,533 --> 00:34:46,293
Sometimes my mother, your mother sometimes ...

586
00:34:46,294 --> 00:34:47,854
Binny... Binny.

587
00:34:47,855 --> 00:34:50,425
Me too ... Binny.

588
00:34:50,426 --> 00:34:52,526
Binny Hey!

589
00:34:52,527 --> 00:34:55,027
Who's that person ? - It does not concern you.

590
00:34:55,028 --> 00:34:58,576
You forget what you did, you destroyed my love.

591
00:34:58,577 --> 00:35:01,777
You did not have the courage, if you had, you would have spoken.

592
00:35:01,778 --> 00:35:03,437
Okay, Binny, you're right.

593
00:35:03,438 --> 00:35:05,202
But today...

594
00:35:05,203 --> 00:35:08,753
I curse you and your brother become Gattu.

595
00:35:08,754 --> 00:35:10,374
Gattu! - Mahesh, I did what?

596
00:35:10,385 --> 00:35:11,135
Cancel your fate.

597
00:35:11,136 --> 00:35:12,736
I cancel anything.

598
00:35:12,737 --> 00:35:15,035
You'll attach a rakhi.

599
00:35:15,036 --> 00:35:15,786
Gattu ...

600
00:35:15,788 --> 00:35:16,659
What are you waiting for ?

601
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:19,060
Pursue him and canceled the spell.

602
00:35:19,472 --> 00:35:21,072
Mahesh.

603
00:35:21,073 --> 00:35:22,053
Mahesh.

604
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:26,870
Binny. - Yes.

605
00:35:26,871 --> 00:35:29,201
What is it ?

606
00:35:29,202 --> 00:35:30,932
Gattu poursuit Mahesh.

607
00:35:30,933 --> 00:35:33,713
Why he says? - I will tell you the way.

608
00:35:33,714 --> 00:35:36,614
Well, up and keep me well.

609
00:35:47,765 --> 00:35:51,965
On returning from the office, I saw Binny to the market.

610
00:35:51,971 --> 00:35:55,441
She was sitting on the bike Bhura.

611
00:35:55,442 --> 00:35:57,442
Bhur?

612
00:35:59,343 --> 00:36:02,316
The seller of milk? - Yes.

613
00:36:02,490 --> 00:36:05,460
The son of Dhappi? - Yes.

614
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:08,740
Should I tell Jaydev? - No no.

615
00:36:08,741 --> 00:36:11,341
It can be misinterpreted.

616
00:36:11,742 --> 00:36:14,692
This girl has no good reputation.

617
00:36:14,941 --> 00:36:20,141
Today, a great event, Mother Sherawali happens.

618
00:36:21,524 --> 00:36:26,524
Mother carries the wishes of your faithful.

619
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:34,816
We are in your hands, give us your grace!

620
00:36:34,817 --> 00:36:40,467
I am delighted to see your enchanting face.

621
00:36:40,468 --> 00:36:42,583
You sing beautifully.

622
00:36:42,584 --> 00:36:45,590
Raj, aunt, if you have any questions, do not hesitate.

623
00:36:45,591 --> 00:36:46,846
No need for questions.

624
00:36:46,892 --> 00:36:49,162
I prepared a whole file on Ritu.

625
00:36:49,163 --> 00:36:51,963
Raj My son, I will send to you by email.

626
00:36:51,964 --> 00:36:54,854
Examine it calmly, and then make your decision.

627
00:36:54,855 --> 00:36:56,555
Is it not, Jaydev? - Yes, aunt.

628
00:36:56,999 --> 00:36:59,629
Gattu, engagement Ritu are coming soon.

629
00:36:59,637 --> 00:37:03,047
Now it's our turn. -Very well.

630
00:37:03,048 --> 00:37:05,253
You seem eager to marry.

631
00:37:05,254 --> 00:37:09,254
Come this side, I see you better!

632
00:37:09,591 --> 00:37:13,191
I'll have a job right after the competition results.

633
00:37:13,192 --> 00:37:17,532
We will make a lavish wedding.

634
00:37:17,533 --> 00:37:20,158
Gattu, turn around.

635
00:37:20,159 --> 00:37:23,264
No, I prefer to look at you.

636
00:37:23,265 --> 00:37:24,235
Why are you hiding ?

637
00:37:24,236 --> 00:37:26,286
You're always on the phone.

638
00:37:26,287 --> 00:37:26,887
Papa.

639
00:37:28,689 --> 00:37:31,189
With whom you spoke?

640
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,400
What is it ?

641
00:37:33,401 --> 00:37:36,031
What is there ? You failed, as always.

642
00:37:36,032 --> 00:37:38,232
The results were published.

643
00:37:38,233 --> 00:37:40,633
So what will you do now?

644
00:37:40,634 --> 00:37:42,494
You're a disgrace.

645
00:37:42,495 --> 00:37:45,285
With whom you spoke?

646
00:37:45,286 --> 00:37:47,586
Let me see that. - No.

647
00:37:47,597 --> 00:37:49,687
Leave me alone.

648
00:37:51,589 --> 00:37:54,789
You sure I failed? - Be damned.

649
00:38:04,652 --> 00:38:06,272
Gattu.

650
00:38:06,273 --> 00:38:07,823
Binny ?

651
00:38:07,824 --> 00:38:09,099
You are not scared ?

652
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:10,525
I'm not afraid of anyone.

653
00:38:10,526 --> 00:38:12,316
I brought food.

654
00:38:12,317 --> 00:38:15,497
Gattu, tu as encore mal?

655
00:38:15,498 --> 00:38:18,418
I do not suffer because of it.

656
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:21,870
I suffer because he has done before you.

657
00:38:21,871 --> 00:38:23,941
I can tell you one thing ? - Yes.

658
00:38:23,942 --> 00:38:26,142
I never imagined ...

659
00:38:26,143 --> 00:38:29,343
What you and I are together.

660
00:38:30,003 --> 00:38:31,759
Yes.

661
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:35,160
Neither do I. I've never imagined.

662
00:38:36,952 --> 00:38:40,512
Gattu, I did not like to see your father beat you

663
00:38:40,513 --> 00:38:43,343
Only my father can do that.

664
00:38:43,344 --> 00:38:46,044
No one can touch me.

665
00:38:46,045 --> 00:38:47,845
I failed my exam this year.

666
00:38:47,846 --> 00:38:49,516
I will try next year.

667
00:38:49,517 --> 00:38:53,997
While Binny is with you, you do not will fail.

668
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:55,958
Binny, Binny.
- Oui.

669
00:38:55,959 --> 00:38:58,089
Reste encore un peu. - Cat!

670
00:38:58,090 --> 00:39:00,090
Binny.

671
00:39:00,191 --> 00:39:04,291
Take me in your arms, it's cold here.

672
00:39:04,292 --> 00:39:06,292
After marriage.

673
00:39:06,293 --> 00:39:09,593
Binny, listen to me.

674
00:39:09,594 --> 00:39:14,594
Leave your window open so I feel your perfume.

675
00:39:22,272 --> 00:39:24,272
Hey you !

676
00:39:31,653 --> 00:39:33,653
You!

677
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:24,610
Do not say his name before me.

678
00:40:24,611 --> 00:40:27,651
He failed his competition.

679
00:40:27,672 --> 00:40:31,324
I'm fed up to pay her studies.

680
00:40:31,325 --> 00:40:33,525
All he wants ...

681
00:40:33,526 --> 00:40:35,625
This is to get a tattoo.

682
00:40:35,626 --> 00:40:37,016
And play cricket.

683
00:40:37,017 --> 00:40:39,917
And talk on the phone all day.

684
00:40:39,918 --> 00:40:43,143
You're right, but violence is not the solution.

685
00:40:43,234 --> 00:40:47,934
I tried to reason with him, but in vain.

686
00:40:47,935 --> 00:40:49,585
I can not anymore.

687
00:40:49,586 --> 00:40:51,586
Thank you.

688
00:40:52,558 --> 00:40:53,548
uncle listening.

689
00:40:53,549 --> 00:40:56,649
You're more experienced than me.

690
00:40:56,650 --> 00:41:01,220
But corporal punishment is make things worse.

691
00:41:01,221 --> 00:41:04,721
So what do you want me to do?

692
00:41:06,213 --> 00:41:08,513
If you want...

693
00:41:08,514 --> 00:41:11,914
... he can come work with me.

694
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:13,750
He studied during the day.

695
00:41:13,751 --> 00:41:16,351
And it works with me at night.

696
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:19,820
I send you all his salary.

697
00:41:19,822 --> 00:41:22,652
Think about it and give me your answer.

698
00:41:22,653 --> 00:41:25,303
No need to think, son.

699
00:41:27,155 --> 00:41:32,325
You help me as a son, not as a neighbor. - No no.

700
00:41:32,326 --> 00:41:33,796
Binny.

701
00:41:33,797 --> 00:41:34,897
Yes.

702
00:41:35,898 --> 00:41:39,818
Because you're like my son.

703
00:41:39,819 --> 00:41:43,154
As a senior, I have to tell you something.

704
00:41:43,155 --> 00:41:44,485
Okay.

705
00:41:44,486 --> 00:41:47,486
My son...

706
00:41:47,487 --> 00:41:50,487
I saw my daughter Binny ...

707
00:41:50,529 --> 00:41:53,429
... With Bhura.

708
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:56,620
I too have seen. - What?

709
00:41:57,970 --> 00:42:00,470
I told you. - Yes.

710
00:42:00,890 --> 00:42:01,580
Yes.

711
00:42:01,581 --> 00:42:03,981
She saw them too.

712
00:42:04,521 --> 00:42:05,721
With him.

713
00:42:05,722 --> 00:42:07,377
What does it mean ?

714
00:42:07,378 --> 00:42:09,378
She was with Bhura ...

715
00:42:12,004 --> 00:42:13,104
With him ?

716
00:42:13,105 --> 00:42:14,374
Yes.

717
00:42:14,375 --> 00:42:16,755
With Bhura? - Yes.

718
00:42:16,756 --> 00:42:18,256
Gattu.

719
00:42:18,267 --> 00:42:19,787
Gattu.

720
00:42:19,788 --> 00:42:21,848
Sure, he still sleeps.

721
00:42:21,849 --> 00:42:23,114
Gattu.

722
00:42:23,167 --> 00:42:25,667
Here it is.

723
00:42:26,493 --> 00:42:28,953
Touch his foot.

724
00:42:28,984 --> 00:42:30,144
Touch his foot.

725
00:42:30,145 --> 00:42:33,095
You're going to work with him, touch his foot.

726
00:42:33,096 --> 00:42:34,749
Tell him the truth.

727
00:42:34,750 --> 00:42:36,700
Everything you know about Binny.

728
00:42:36,701 --> 00:42:38,400
Go.

729
00:42:38,451 --> 00:42:40,751
What, Dad?

730
00:42:40,752 --> 00:42:43,022
Binny, is not like your sister?

731
00:42:43,023 --> 00:42:44,723
Then tell him everything.

732
00:42:44,724 --> 00:42:45,409
Spoken.

733
00:42:45,410 --> 00:42:47,410
Gattu.

734
00:42:49,042 --> 00:42:51,482
Hello uncle, brother, hello, aunt.

735
00:42:51,483 --> 00:42:54,053
Gattu, we'll be late for the game.

736
00:42:54,054 --> 00:42:56,124
My aunt ... - Binny, how are you?

737
00:42:56,125 --> 00:42:57,125
Well.

738
00:42:57,126 --> 00:43:00,526
Aunt, I want a little butter.

739
00:43:03,490 --> 00:43:05,990
Gattu, let's go. - Yes.

740
00:43:10,956 --> 00:43:12,716
What is the problem ?

741
00:43:12,717 --> 00:43:14,757
Say, you play with the phone?

742
00:43:14,758 --> 00:43:18,958
Make sure the microphone is connected, go!

743
00:43:18,969 --> 00:43:20,739
You're wasting your time.

744
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:22,770
How to give him the role of Shiva?

745
00:43:22,771 --> 00:43:24,001
Where is Mandi?

746
00:43:24,002 --> 00:43:25,262
It's his first day.

747
00:43:25,263 --> 00:43:26,533
Why this role?

748
00:43:26,534 --> 00:43:28,234
Go get Mandi. - Yes.

749
00:43:28,235 --> 00:43:30,235
I will go get him.

750
00:43:33,415 --> 00:43:34,415
No no.

751
00:43:34,416 --> 00:43:36,116
Gattu, sit down.

752
00:43:36,117 --> 00:43:39,187
I came to talk to you.

753
00:43:39,188 --> 00:43:41,638
Gattu, I'm upset for two days.

754
00:43:41,639 --> 00:43:43,939
What is this, brother?

755
00:43:45,934 --> 00:43:47,857
Tell me the truth.

756
00:43:47,858 --> 00:43:51,083
When is the relationship between Benny and Bhura did it start?

757
00:43:51,084 --> 00:43:54,084
I do not know.

758
00:43:55,036 --> 00:43:58,036
Bhura, the guy selling us milk?

759
00:43:58,737 --> 00:44:01,297
Since when are they together?

760
00:44:01,298 --> 00:44:02,058
Tell me ?

761
00:44:02,059 --> 00:44:04,929
I know nothing.

762
00:44:06,991 --> 00:44:08,991
Listen, Gattu.

763
00:44:09,533 --> 00:44:11,023
As ajju ...

764
00:44:11,024 --> 00:44:12,514
As Binny ...

765
00:44:12,515 --> 00:44:14,705
You too.

766
00:44:14,706 --> 00:44:16,185
You're a brother to me.

767
00:44:16,186 --> 00:44:18,196
Your brother ?

768
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:19,436
I'm not?

769
00:44:19,437 --> 00:44:20,837
Non.

770
00:44:20,838 --> 00:44:22,628
What is happening ?

771
00:44:22,629 --> 00:44:24,419
I ask you for the last time.

772
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:29,865
When the relationship between Benny and Bhura did it start?

773
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:32,440
You're not going to talk.

774
00:44:33,005 --> 00:44:34,475
I know Gattu.

775
00:44:34,476 --> 00:44:36,256
You are loyal.

776
00:44:36,257 --> 00:44:39,117
You do not denounce your friend.

777
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:41,720
But your silence ...

778
00:44:42,321 --> 00:44:44,321
That speaks volumes.

779
00:44:44,322 --> 00:44:46,532
Brother, the truth is that Bhura ...

780
00:44:46,533 --> 00:44:48,733
No, that's enough.

781
00:44:48,734 --> 00:44:50,954
I understood.

782
00:44:50,955 --> 00:44:52,175
It is not your fault.

783
00:44:52,176 --> 00:44:53,766
Continue your work.

784
00:44:53,767 --> 00:44:55,767
Goodbye.

785
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:02,820
Oh ! The son of Dhappi?

786
00:45:02,821 --> 00:45:04,531
Binny more ...

787
00:45:04,532 --> 00:45:08,592
Brother, this is the same guy who sells us milk?

788
00:45:08,632 --> 00:45:12,372
But it's been that no longer comes.

789
00:45:12,373 --> 00:45:14,583
That was before he just keeps coming.

790
00:45:14,584 --> 00:45:16,240
How did you know?

791
00:45:16,241 --> 00:45:18,531
Cat here me a dit.

792
00:45:18,532 --> 00:45:19,832
Brother.

793
00:45:19,833 --> 00:45:20,933
Now...

794
00:45:20,934 --> 00:45:23,554
And my marriage, in all this?

795
00:45:23,555 --> 00:45:25,010
And our reputation?

796
00:45:25,011 --> 00:45:28,211
Do not worry, everything will be fine.

797
00:45:28,383 --> 00:45:31,683
Above all, do not say anything to anyone.

798
00:45:33,885 --> 00:45:35,185
Jydev.

799
00:45:35,186 --> 00:45:37,625
The truth is difficult to accept.

800
00:45:37,626 --> 00:45:43,076
This affects us as a neighbor, heard rumors about your sister.

801
00:45:43,077 --> 00:45:45,447
I do not know if I should tell you?

802
00:45:45,448 --> 00:45:47,098
What do you say, aunt?

803
00:45:47,099 --> 00:45:49,639
I tell you the truth.

804
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:51,449
He saw a motorcycle with Bhura.

805
00:45:51,450 --> 00:45:53,420
Continue to expand your clothes.

806
00:45:53,421 --> 00:45:56,455
My son, you know how are the young.

807
00:45:56,486 --> 00:46:00,186
The laptop is their whole life.

808
00:46:00,187 --> 00:46:01,887
You have to know to be flexible.

809
00:46:01,888 --> 00:46:03,078
Listening.

810
00:46:03,079 --> 00:46:05,909
I am older than you.

811
00:46:05,910 --> 00:46:07,425
So my advice.

812
00:46:07,426 --> 00:46:09,211
Do not do anything.

813
00:46:09,212 --> 00:46:13,412
Because love is like a raging sea.

814
00:46:13,413 --> 00:46:16,623
We can not contain it.

815
00:46:16,634 --> 00:46:21,005
Do not worry, this relationship will not last.

816
00:46:21,006 --> 00:46:23,246
What is needed is monitored.

817
00:46:23,247 --> 00:46:26,096
How to do ? I work all the time.

818
00:46:26,097 --> 00:46:29,167
Do not say that we are with you.

819
00:46:29,168 --> 00:46:31,167
We are a family.

820
00:46:31,168 --> 00:46:33,768
Expect the wedding Ritu's over.

821
00:46:33,769 --> 00:46:40,370
And I promise you that I will do Bhura a brother Binny.

822
00:46:40,371 --> 00:46:42,271
You can be sure.

823
00:46:42,272 --> 00:46:45,372
Jaydev, you're not used to it.

824
00:46:45,373 --> 00:46:47,223
Because you're single.

825
00:46:47,224 --> 00:46:48,324
Yes.

826
00:46:48,325 --> 00:46:50,925
Let us agree.

827
00:46:50,926 --> 00:46:53,726
Binny has no brothers.

828
00:46:53,727 --> 00:46:55,247
But three brothers.

829
00:46:55,249 --> 00:46:58,249
Toi, Ajju et Gattu.

830
00:46:59,451 --> 00:47:02,651
Ajju will be inside and outside Gattu.

831
00:47:02,652 --> 00:47:04,852
Gattu.

832
00:47:05,252 --> 00:47:07,402
One thing is certain.

833
00:47:07,403 --> 00:47:09,443
The neighborhood girls are sisters.

834
00:47:09,444 --> 00:47:10,554
Yes Dad.

835
00:47:10,555 --> 00:47:12,855
Yes, listen, Gattu.

836
00:47:12,856 --> 00:47:15,926
Now you have to watch Binny.

837
00:47:15,927 --> 00:47:19,357
Thou you taking to college in the morning and you brought the evening.

838
00:47:19,358 --> 00:47:23,058
One more thing, make sure she does not meet Bhura.

839
00:47:23,059 --> 00:47:24,489
Including ?

840
00:47:24,490 --> 00:47:25,390
Jydev.

841
00:47:25,391 --> 00:47:29,171
What is the start time of Benny? - Half past eight.

842
00:47:29,172 --> 00:47:31,572
Yes that's right.

843
00:47:35,110 --> 00:47:37,710
He surely from view.

844
00:47:38,541 --> 00:47:40,041
Your brother likes me.

845
00:47:40,042 --> 00:47:42,441
He asked me to take you to college. - What?

846
00:47:42,442 --> 00:47:45,079
You just come to have this job. How could you?

847
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:47,650
Only through my charisma.

848
00:47:47,651 --> 00:47:50,275
I have earned the trust of your whole family.

849
00:47:50,276 --> 00:47:51,126
Gattu.

850
00:47:51,127 --> 00:47:52,407
I'm afraid.

851
00:47:52,408 --> 00:47:54,998
Everything must say to my brother.

852
00:47:54,999 --> 00:47:57,499
Binny, nothing will happen.

853
00:47:57,533 --> 00:47:59,633
I will talk soon to your brother.

854
00:47:59,634 --> 00:48:01,294
Do not worry.

855
00:48:01,295 --> 00:48:04,195
You are mine forever.

856
00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:08,945
I have two good news.

857
00:48:08,946 --> 00:48:09,796
The first...

858
00:48:09,797 --> 00:48:13,247
Ritu has been accepted and the wedding is confirmed.

859
00:48:13,248 --> 00:48:15,148
Thank God.

860
00:48:15,149 --> 00:48:18,389
A little cake, aunt? - I'll take later.

861
00:48:18,390 --> 00:48:19,970
Hear more ...

862
00:48:19,971 --> 00:48:22,671
You remember the aunt and uncle Raj.

863
00:48:22,672 --> 00:48:24,272
They have a son, Rahul.

864
00:48:24,273 --> 00:48:26,092
He works in France. - Yes.

865
00:48:26,093 --> 00:48:29,263
He was seduced by Binny.

866
00:48:29,264 --> 00:48:31,564
I sent you his profile.

867
00:48:31,565 --> 00:48:34,645
You will do two weddings at the same time.

868
00:48:34,646 --> 00:48:37,236
Aunt, you know ... Binny

869
00:48:37,237 --> 00:48:39,187
You're worried about her studies.

870
00:48:39,188 --> 00:48:42,358
She will continue her studies in France.

871
00:48:42,359 --> 00:48:43,529
Think about it.

872
00:48:43,530 --> 00:48:46,197
You will not find better than him.

873
00:48:46,208 --> 00:48:50,123
Yes, it's true, aunt, this is a good family.

874
00:48:50,124 --> 00:48:52,234
So where's the problem ?

875
00:48:52,235 --> 00:48:56,065
The groom's family to see you tomorrow.

876
00:48:56,066 --> 00:48:59,513
Go ahead, make the engagement and the wedding.

877
00:48:59,514 --> 00:49:03,414
So take some cake. - Yes.

878
00:49:09,965 --> 00:49:12,235
No reason to worry. - Yes.

879
00:49:12,236 --> 00:49:15,636
I want to impress Jaydev.

880
00:49:15,637 --> 00:49:18,697
He'll think I'm all set. - Yes.

881
00:49:18,698 --> 00:49:20,998
What he will do is get you the rakhi.

882
00:49:21,059 --> 00:49:23,159
Let him do. - Let him do.

883
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:24,885
Your plan is perfect.

884
00:49:24,886 --> 00:49:27,036
Jaydev, we must act.

885
00:49:27,037 --> 00:49:28,187
Listen to me.

886
00:49:28,188 --> 00:49:33,588
This affects not only your family, but the whole neighborhood.

887
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:40,340
Here they are.

888
00:49:40,341 --> 00:49:42,041
She is my sister.

889
00:49:42,052 --> 00:49:43,142
Hi, uncle. - Hi.

890
00:49:43,173 --> 00:49:43,973
Hi brother.

891
00:49:43,974 --> 00:49:45,874
Listen, my son ...

892
00:49:47,610 --> 00:49:49,490
How dare you seduce my sister?

893
00:49:49,491 --> 00:49:50,963
You dare to seduce my sister?

894
00:49:50,964 --> 00:49:52,884
Calm. - Who do you think you are?

895
00:49:52,885 --> 00:49:57,335
If you approach yet Binny, I'll kill you.

896
00:49:57,336 --> 00:50:00,536
Here's the money for your milk, keep the rest.

897
00:50:00,537 --> 00:50:03,956
Tell him who I am. - You are the brother of Binny.

898
00:50:03,957 --> 00:50:06,177
How dare you slap me?

899
00:50:06,179 --> 00:50:08,319
You made a mistake. - Go away.

900
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:10,859
My mother did not slapped me. - Will it, bastard.

901
00:50:10,860 --> 00:50:13,090
Do you know who I am ? - I am not afraid.

902
00:50:13,091 --> 00:50:17,611
You get more milk, drink water. - We'll see.

903
00:50:17,612 --> 00:50:20,317
Jaydev, you made a mistake. - Let's move on.

904
00:50:20,318 --> 00:50:21,388
One.

905
00:50:21,419 --> 00:50:22,429
Come back here.

906
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:27,020
You should not have hit him.

907
00:50:27,021 --> 00:50:29,621
He is the son of Dhappi.

908
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:35,960
That's why you brought me here? - No no.

909
00:50:36,311 --> 00:50:39,741
No one ever hit me. - I know it.

910
00:50:39,742 --> 00:50:43,292
Out of respect for Binny, I did nothing. - Yes, Bhura, I know.

911
00:50:43,293 --> 00:50:48,093
This is a family of wayward. - Calm down.

912
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:50,374
It's okay.

913
00:50:50,375 --> 00:50:53,475
I came to the rakhi and he slapped me.

914
00:50:53,476 --> 00:50:55,576
Bhura, I'll talk to him.

915
00:50:55,577 --> 00:50:58,319
It's okay, do not cry.

916
00:50:58,320 --> 00:50:59,820
And your ear?

917
00:51:00,021 --> 00:51:03,181
It hurts and I have a ringing in the ear.

918
00:51:03,182 --> 00:51:04,912
Show me.

919
00:51:04,913 --> 00:51:07,533
You have nothing.

920
00:51:07,534 --> 00:51:09,274
Bhur.

921
00:51:09,275 --> 00:51:11,275
I will avenge you, I swear.

922
00:51:12,177 --> 00:51:15,647
I'm going to kill him. - You're right, Bhura.

923
00:51:15,648 --> 00:51:18,748
It's okay, do not cry.

924
00:51:20,749 --> 00:51:22,349
You take a beer?

925
00:51:22,350 --> 00:51:25,850
No, I want juice. - You take a juice.

926
00:51:27,190 --> 00:51:29,590
Let's go.

927
00:51:29,591 --> 00:51:32,772
What is it between you and Bhura? - Bhura?

928
00:51:32,773 --> 00:51:35,873
I have nothing to do with Bhura. - Binny, do not lie!

929
00:51:35,874 --> 00:51:41,014
Come back here, stop eavesdropping.

930
00:51:41,015 --> 00:51:43,315
If they see you, they will get into trouble.

931
00:51:43,516 --> 00:51:45,116
Shut up.

932
00:51:45,117 --> 00:51:46,897
You do not want to tell me ?

933
00:51:46,898 --> 00:51:48,328
What are you doing, Jaydev?

934
00:51:48,329 --> 00:51:49,809
What, Mom?

935
00:51:49,810 --> 00:51:51,399
Look what she did.

936
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:54,220
I swear on Grandma that I have nothing to do with Bhura.

937
00:51:54,221 --> 00:51:56,525
Swear on my head, not grandmother.

938
00:51:56,626 --> 00:51:57,626
Mother, one minute.

939
00:51:57,627 --> 00:51:58,317
Brother.

940
00:51:58,318 --> 00:52:02,318
I swear I have no relationship with Bhura.

941
00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:04,119
You see, Mom?

942
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:06,280
She lies to me.

943
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:07,999
Where's your cell?

944
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:08,599
Here it is.

945
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:10,490
Ajju, keep it, do not give it.

946
00:52:10,491 --> 00:52:12,591
Put him inside. - Give me the SIM card.

947
00:52:12,592 --> 00:52:14,862
Ajju ... ajju. - Do not give him.

948
00:52:14,863 --> 00:52:17,203
Mum. - I will destroy this notebook.

949
00:52:17,204 --> 00:52:19,494
Shut up, Ritu. - You are the cause of everything.

950
00:52:19,495 --> 00:52:20,895
Ritu, shut up.

951
00:52:20,896 --> 00:52:23,696
Oh ! Shut up !

952
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:26,600
Listen to me now.

953
00:52:26,610 --> 00:52:28,610
That's enough.

954
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:32,790
Listen, Binny ...

955
00:52:32,791 --> 00:52:34,919
Tomorrow engagement Ritu.

956
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:37,570
There is someone who will come to you.

957
00:52:37,623 --> 00:52:40,263
Please do not be mean to your sister.

958
00:52:40,264 --> 00:52:41,664
His marriage was decided.

959
00:52:41,665 --> 00:52:44,795
Binny...

960
00:52:44,796 --> 00:52:47,646
You will come.

961
00:52:47,647 --> 00:52:50,847
Whether you want it or not.

962
00:52:50,848 --> 00:52:53,898
Do not let her out, Mom. - My son, you ...

963
00:52:53,899 --> 00:52:54,719
Yes talk.

964
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:57,370
Ajju, you know the password?

965
00:52:57,381 --> 00:52:59,045
Mandi has not returned.

966
00:52:59,046 --> 00:52:59,846
Come back.

967
00:52:59,847 --> 00:53:01,346
Tell Gattu I just see it.

968
00:53:01,347 --> 00:53:03,947
Shut up, let me listen.

969
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:07,240
All right, aunt? - Hi, son.

970
00:53:07,261 --> 00:53:12,161
I like to walk after dinner.

971
00:53:15,738 --> 00:53:17,038
Yes talk.

972
00:53:21,589 --> 00:53:22,239
Mouna.

973
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:25,240
You have to see the holding of Shiva.

974
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:31,800
You crying Cat.

975
00:53:31,801 --> 00:53:33,970
I slapped Bhura unconsciously.

976
00:53:33,971 --> 00:53:35,561
I raised my hand on Binny.

977
00:53:35,562 --> 00:53:38,062
I am not well.

978
00:53:38,122 --> 00:53:40,502
I wanted everything to be perfect.

979
00:53:40,503 --> 00:53:43,103
I only fear for Ritu.

980
00:53:43,404 --> 00:53:46,224
Have you talked to Bhura?

981
00:53:46,225 --> 00:53:48,225
Not yet.

982
00:53:48,838 --> 00:53:51,128
I made the right decision.

983
00:53:51,129 --> 00:53:56,229
Tomorrow engagement Ritu and also those of Binny.

984
00:53:57,430 --> 00:53:59,250
Engagement Binny?

985
00:53:59,251 --> 00:54:00,851
Yes.

986
00:54:00,852 --> 00:54:03,032
I found him a good match.

987
00:54:03,033 --> 00:54:05,953
I have a lot of things to do.

988
00:54:05,954 --> 00:54:10,619
I'll get there, you're busy in here, a brother there, a brother here?

989
00:54:10,620 --> 00:54:15,120
Please, Gattu, I'll go sort it out.

990
00:54:20,910 --> 00:54:22,910
The number dialed is unavailable.

991
00:54:22,931 --> 00:54:28,531
And now, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to God Shiva.

992
00:54:32,420 --> 00:54:34,646
Lord Shiva is underway.

993
00:54:34,647 --> 00:54:36,647
He is on his way.

994
00:54:36,999 --> 00:54:38,999
Mandi, where is he?

995
00:54:44,049 --> 00:54:45,449
Sir, get up.

996
00:54:45,450 --> 00:54:47,210
You're okay ?

997
00:54:47,211 --> 00:54:49,471
Get up. - It's okay.

998
00:54:49,472 --> 00:54:51,792
Yes I'm allright thanks. - What, thank you?

999
00:54:51,794 --> 00:54:55,094
You demolished the car and you apologizing? - I did not hit ...

1000
00:54:55,095 --> 00:54:56,494
You drive too fast. - What?

1001
00:54:56,495 --> 00:54:58,075
I ... - I'll hit you.

1002
00:54:58,076 --> 00:55:00,296
Brother, I'm in a hurry, I have to go.

1003
00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:03,087
Wait, where are you?

1004
00:55:03,088 --> 00:55:05,988
He tries to run away. - No sir.

1005
00:55:05,989 --> 00:55:10,849
Let me go now, I'll pay tomorrow for the damage.

1006
00:55:10,850 --> 00:55:11,860
Get him!

1007
00:55:11,861 --> 00:55:12,631
Take it.

1008
00:55:12,632 --> 00:55:14,632
I have to go.

1009
00:55:24,415 --> 00:55:26,365
We must avoid a trial.

1010
00:55:26,366 --> 00:55:28,386
Mr Gattu Nautiyal was brought here ...

1011
00:55:28,387 --> 00:55:30,817
I came, sir. - Here is the commissioner.

1012
00:55:30,818 --> 00:55:32,568
Bhur ... Bhur.

1013
00:55:32,934 --> 00:55:34,469
Gattu, okay?

1014
00:55:34,470 --> 00:55:35,695
Let me out. - Yes.

1015
00:55:36,012 --> 00:55:38,652
What is the matter? - Everything is in order.

1016
00:55:38,653 --> 00:55:42,543
Mishra, release the young man.

1017
00:55:42,549 --> 00:55:44,281
Bhura, the keys to your bike. - What?

1018
00:55:44,282 --> 00:55:45,812
Give me the keys.

1019
00:55:45,813 --> 00:55:48,193
Gets my laptop. - Thank you for everything.

1020
00:55:48,194 --> 00:55:48,954
Gattu ...

1021
00:55:49,055 --> 00:55:52,095
Mom, how are you, Mom? - I have...

1022
00:55:52,096 --> 00:55:53,946
What are you doing ? Mom, leave us alone.

1023
00:55:53,952 --> 00:55:55,222
Mom says to him.

1024
00:55:55,223 --> 00:55:58,923
I told you to leave, mom. - Mum !

1025
00:55:59,570 --> 00:56:01,696
What are you doing, Binny? Why all of this ?

1026
00:56:01,698 --> 00:56:04,398
Why this scandal? - You had to see me.

1027
00:56:04,399 --> 00:56:07,641
Our reputation is at stake, Binny! Listen, Binny.

1028
00:56:07,642 --> 00:56:10,342
Accept the engagement, the type is good.

1029
00:56:10,373 --> 00:56:11,848
Come, I beg you.

1030
00:56:11,888 --> 00:56:14,288
Please.

1031
00:56:16,020 --> 00:56:17,620
Binny.

1032
00:56:17,621 --> 00:56:19,621
Come here.

1033
00:56:20,483 --> 00:56:22,483
She comes.

1034
00:56:39,513 --> 00:56:42,213
Pass it the ring finger.

1035
00:56:45,313 --> 00:56:47,313
Very well.

1036
00:56:54,390 --> 00:56:56,790
Congratulations, dear Sister.

1037
00:56:59,339 --> 00:57:01,539
Congratulations.

1038
00:58:56,890 --> 00:58:58,910
Binny, it's my fault.

1039
00:58:58,911 --> 00:59:03,042
It's not your fault, it's mine, I should have any say.

1040
00:59:03,043 --> 00:59:06,343
I also should have talked with Jaydev.

1041
00:59:06,344 --> 00:59:10,124
Gattu, whatever happens, do not leave me. - What?

1042
00:59:10,125 --> 00:59:12,405
Binny can not live without you.

1043
00:59:12,406 --> 00:59:15,927
Gattu, I'm sorry. - Binny, why you are you apologizing?

1044
00:59:15,928 --> 00:59:18,248
It is not your fault.

1045
00:59:19,249 --> 00:59:21,679
Are we fled Gattu?

1046
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:24,610
But, it will harm the marriage Ritu.

1047
00:59:24,611 --> 00:59:27,131
So what do we do ?

1048
00:59:27,132 --> 00:59:30,132
I thought I was strong to stand up to my brother.

1049
00:59:30,133 --> 00:59:31,873
Do not say that.

1050
00:59:31,874 --> 00:59:34,874
You're still strong.

1051
00:59:36,122 --> 00:59:37,722
I'll talk with Jaydev.

1052
00:59:37,723 --> 00:59:40,163
No, it will affect the wedding Ritu.

1053
00:59:40,164 --> 00:59:41,334
Find another idea.

1054
00:59:41,335 --> 00:59:46,885
An idea that will allow Binny to be to you and Ritu to marry.

1055
00:59:46,922 --> 00:59:52,122
Gattu, my reputation is already tarnished by rumors Bhura and me.

1056
00:59:52,212 --> 00:59:53,712
Do something, Gattu.

1057
00:59:53,713 --> 00:59:55,883
Please.

1058
00:59:55,892 --> 00:59:58,332
This is for you. - Do not bother, Mom.

1059
00:59:58,333 --> 01:00:00,773
Take it, go ahead.

1060
01:00:00,774 --> 01:00:02,974
Take it, my friend.

1061
01:00:02,985 --> 01:00:04,025
Mom listening.

1062
01:00:04,026 --> 01:00:05,825
I want to tell you something. - Yes.

1063
01:00:05,826 --> 01:00:08,656
Having listened to you ...

1064
01:00:08,667 --> 01:00:13,247
... I understood why the voice of Binny was so beautiful.

1065
01:00:18,045 --> 01:00:19,695
Brother ... - Speak.

1066
01:00:19,696 --> 01:00:22,796
Mandi called, he would be absent tonight.

1067
01:00:22,802 --> 01:00:24,342
Nevermind, I present.

1068
01:00:24,348 --> 01:00:28,178
Rahul, here Gattu, our neighbor across the street.

1069
01:00:28,179 --> 01:00:30,679
Hi, Gattu! I am Rahul. - I'm Shiv.

1070
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:32,980
Oh Shiv !

1071
01:00:33,032 --> 01:00:34,152
It's an iPad?

1072
01:00:34,153 --> 01:00:35,933
iPad What? Touch his foot.

1073
01:00:35,934 --> 01:00:37,764
Never mind.

1074
01:00:37,765 --> 01:00:39,105
Yes, it's an iPad.

1075
01:00:39,106 --> 01:00:40,706
There are games? - Of course.

1076
01:00:40,707 --> 01:00:42,082
I will show you.

1077
01:00:42,083 --> 01:00:44,082
Mom, this is my brother.

1078
01:00:44,083 --> 01:00:44,933
Here.

1079
01:00:44,934 --> 01:00:47,434
Thank you, brother.

1080
01:00:47,861 --> 01:00:52,081
Raj asked me to give it to Ritu, can I do it?

1081
01:00:52,082 --> 01:00:53,103
Yes of course.

1082
01:00:53,104 --> 01:00:55,904
Gattu, take him upstairs.

1083
01:00:57,612 --> 01:01:00,212
Binny, Rahul comes here.

1084
01:01:01,589 --> 01:01:03,089
Binny, see if it's there.

1085
01:01:03,090 --> 01:01:03,990
Look ...

1086
01:01:03,991 --> 01:01:05,791
See if he's there.

1087
01:01:05,792 --> 01:01:06,462
Look ...

1088
01:01:06,463 --> 01:01:08,163
What are you doing ?

1089
01:01:08,164 --> 01:01:10,694
Hi, stepsister.

1090
01:01:10,695 --> 01:01:12,695
I hope not to disturb you.

1091
01:01:12,702 --> 01:01:15,302
No, why do you say that?

1092
01:01:15,303 --> 01:01:19,603
In fact, the relationship does not preclude tact.

1093
01:01:19,603 --> 01:01:21,693
My brother sent you ...

1094
01:01:21,694 --> 01:01:23,108
A gift.

1095
01:01:23,109 --> 01:01:24,369
It is true ? - Yes.

1096
01:01:24,370 --> 01:01:26,070
And he asked me ...

1097
01:01:26,071 --> 01:01:28,071
One minute.

1098
01:01:29,459 --> 01:01:31,259
I have to bow down!

1099
01:01:31,260 --> 01:01:34,210
It's a gift for you, my brother Raj.

1100
01:01:34,211 --> 01:01:36,011
Thank you.

1101
01:01:36,012 --> 01:01:38,512
I also have a gift ...

1102
01:01:39,602 --> 01:01:41,782
... For your sister Binny.

1103
01:01:41,807 --> 01:01:43,557
So...

1104
01:01:43,558 --> 01:01:45,758
... I can ? - Go ahead.

1105
01:01:45,759 --> 01:01:48,119
You are very romantic.

1106
01:01:48,120 --> 01:01:51,120
It's your fiancée?

1107
01:01:51,211 --> 01:01:54,011
Up to you to decide. - Well !

1108
01:01:55,507 --> 01:01:57,737
Salut, Binny.

1109
01:01:57,738 --> 01:01:59,738
How are you ?

1110
01:02:00,910 --> 01:02:02,910
Well.

1111
01:02:03,777 --> 01:02:06,037
Nice to finally meet you.

1112
01:02:06,038 --> 01:02:07,358
And...

1113
01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:10,059
And I'll tell you something.

1114
01:02:11,041 --> 01:02:15,071
In France, I'm a fan of your songs.

1115
01:02:15,947 --> 01:02:20,025
Mom sent me a video of you, I've seen several times.

1116
01:02:20,051 --> 01:02:22,171
And...

1117
01:02:22,172 --> 01:02:24,071
I've seen it again and again.

1118
01:02:24,072 --> 01:02:26,172
And...

1119
01:02:26,173 --> 01:02:28,873
Again.

1120
01:02:29,412 --> 01:02:32,132
Ah ! wait, I've a gift for you.

1121
01:02:32,133 --> 01:02:34,183
It's an iPhone.

1122
01:02:34,184 --> 01:02:39,384
You can record songs & send em to me.

1123
01:02:39,385 --> 01:02:40,685
Thank you.

1124
01:02:40,724 --> 01:02:43,494
Will you join me for a coffee?

1125
01:02:43,495 --> 01:02:48,625
Mmm, i've to ask at home.

1126
01:02:48,626 --> 01:02:50,586
Ok.

1127
01:02:50,962 --> 01:02:53,462
Ask then.

1128
01:02:55,037 --> 01:02:57,037
And...

1129
01:02:58,263 --> 01:03:00,763
You're so beautiful.

1130
01:03:01,405 --> 01:03:03,405
Bro lets go down.

1131
01:03:04,002 --> 01:03:06,002
Lets go.

1132
01:03:08,092 --> 01:03:11,612
Rahul, the meal is almost ready.
- Honestly, am not hungry.

1133
01:03:11,613 --> 01:03:12,283
What do you mean?

1134
01:03:12,284 --> 01:03:17,824
If you don't mind can I take binny out for a coffee?

1135
01:03:17,825 --> 01:03:18,645
Yes, take her.

1136
01:03:18,646 --> 01:03:19,916
Is she refusing ?

1137
01:03:19,947 --> 01:03:22,287
No, not like that.
- I'll tell her.

1138
01:03:22,288 --> 01:03:24,158
Thank you.

1139
01:03:24,169 --> 01:03:25,988
All problems.

1140
01:03:25,989 --> 01:03:27,889
Oh, Shiv, Problem is !

1141
01:03:27,948 --> 01:03:30,248


1142
01:03:30,249 --> 01:03:33,069
I need a sim for Binny.

1143
01:03:33,070 --> 01:03:37,340


1144
01:03:37,341 --> 01:03:39,941


1145
01:03:42,462 --> 01:03:44,462


1146
01:03:44,487 --> 01:03:47,227
I need your ID. - My card ?

1147
01:03:47,228 --> 01:03:48,928
Why ?

1148
01:03:50,429 --> 01:03:51,179
Nothing.

1149
01:03:51,180 --> 01:03:54,180
I appreciate that, thank you.

1150
01:04:02,702 --> 01:04:04,702
Ah! Hold on.

1151
01:04:05,032 --> 01:04:07,732
Come on, sit down. - Thank you.

1152
01:04:13,185 --> 01:04:14,215
OK then...

1153
01:04:14,216 --> 01:04:15,176
Bye-law. - Bye.

1154
01:04:15,177 --> 01:04:17,297
I come next time?

1155
01:04:17,298 --> 01:04:18,797
Yes you can.

1156
01:04:18,798 --> 01:04:20,798
Goodbye, son.

1157
01:04:33,541 --> 01:04:36,191
Gattu, do not forget the money.

1158
01:04:36,192 --> 01:04:40,522
I want my hand, or I tell everything to my brother.

1159
01:04:41,239 --> 01:04:43,739
Bad boy.

1160
01:05:05,236 --> 01:05:10,006
My only wish.

1161
01:05:10,007 --> 01:05:14,707
It is to be with you.

1162
01:05:14,708 --> 01:05:19,228
I can not tell you.

1163
01:05:19,229 --> 01:05:24,729
You must understand by yourself.

1164
01:05:25,961 --> 01:05:30,581
Come here, let me look at you.

1165
01:05:30,582 --> 01:05:36,682
And dive into the depths of your eyes.

1166
01:05:36,693 --> 01:05:42,793
For no one can find me.

1167
01:05:42,794 --> 01:05:47,494
My only wish.

1168
01:05:47,495 --> 01:05:52,295
It is to be with you.

1169
01:05:52,296 --> 01:05:57,096
I can not tell you.

1170
01:05:57,097 --> 01:05:58,597
You must understand by yourself.

1171
01:05:58,598 --> 01:06:01,368
Binny is very lucky.

1172
01:06:01,369 --> 01:06:04,269
She found a good match.

1173
01:06:05,181 --> 01:06:07,851
It will make a good husband.

1174
01:06:07,852 --> 01:06:10,752
Oh my God !

1175
01:06:11,827 --> 01:06:15,667
Everything is perfect, Gattu.

1176
01:06:15,668 --> 01:06:18,948
They make a cute couple.

1177
01:06:18,949 --> 01:06:22,049
Bhura, it's over.

1178
01:06:22,050 --> 01:06:22,650
Get ready.

1179
01:06:22,651 --> 01:06:26,886
When you're not with me.

1180
01:06:27,187 --> 01:06:31,587
I lost all my bearings.

1181
01:06:31,588 --> 01:06:36,418
I ... Mmm ...

1182
01:06:36,419 --> 01:06:41,139
When you walk away from me, even for a second.

1183
01:06:41,140 --> 01:06:45,890
My heart's worried about you.

1184
01:06:45,891 --> 01:06:50,521
I can not live without you.

1185
01:06:50,522 --> 01:06:56,382
You are my Everything.

1186
01:06:56,513 --> 01:07:02,813
You are my only refuge.

1187
01:07:02,854 --> 01:07:07,534
My only wish.

1188
01:07:07,535 --> 01:07:12,325
It is to be with you.

1189
01:07:12,326 --> 01:07:17,026
I can not tell you.

1190
01:07:17,027 --> 01:07:21,627
You must understand by yourself.

1191
01:07:21,628 --> 01:07:26,308
My only wish.

1192
01:07:26,309 --> 01:07:30,809
It is to be with you.

1193
01:07:42,032 --> 01:07:43,502
It seems...

1194
01:07:43,503 --> 01:07:47,503
... that your luck has turned.

1195
01:07:48,513 --> 01:07:52,723
Bhura, I have trouble understanding ...

1196
01:07:52,724 --> 01:07:58,724
Why those who call Rahul are they bad?

1197
01:07:59,716 --> 01:08:01,946
In the movie...

1198
01:08:01,947 --> 01:08:03,277
... Kuch Kuch Hota Hai .

1199
01:08:03,278 --> 01:08:06,091
This romantic film ...

1200
01:08:06,092 --> 01:08:08,548
... tell me that piqued the girlfriend of Salman?

1201
01:08:10,549 --> 01:08:11,389
Rahul.

1202
01:08:11,390 --> 01:08:12,470
And in the movie ...

1203
01:08:12,471 --> 01:08:14,390
Dil Kkk To Pagal Hai K

1204
01:08:14,391 --> 01:08:17,431
Tell me that piqued girlfriend Akshay?

1205
01:08:19,432 --> 01:08:20,622
Rahul. - Rahul.

1206
01:08:20,624 --> 01:08:24,084
The other film which remained on display for years ...

1207
01:08:24,085 --> 01:08:25,005
... DDLJ .

1208
01:08:25,006 --> 01:08:26,686
DDLJ , I saw it.

1209
01:08:26,697 --> 01:08:30,197
The star of this film called Singh.

1210
01:08:30,208 --> 01:08:32,538
Tell me who seduced his daughter.

1211
01:08:32,539 --> 01:08:33,689
Who...?

1212
01:08:33,690 --> 01:08:35,364
Rahul? - Rahul.

1213
01:08:37,116 --> 01:08:38,825
No, brother, no!

1214
01:08:38,842 --> 01:08:40,342
Non.

1215
01:08:40,343 --> 01:08:42,343
That was a Raj.

1216
01:08:42,344 --> 01:08:43,422
Raj was the hero.

1217
01:08:43,423 --> 01:08:46,624
Raj or Rahul is the same person.

1218
01:08:46,632 --> 01:08:49,832
They are the same.

1219
01:08:51,546 --> 01:08:55,486
It's over, Bhura's all over.

1220
01:08:55,488 --> 01:08:56,738
Everything is finished.

1221
01:08:56,779 --> 01:09:01,079
If you want your love story ends well.

1222
01:09:01,080 --> 01:09:04,980
You definitely have to commit a crime.

1223
01:09:05,012 --> 01:09:09,582
Brother, there is only one way to get rid of Rahul.

1224
01:09:09,583 --> 01:09:11,373
What's this ?

1225
01:09:11,404 --> 01:09:13,704
The death.

1226
01:09:13,705 --> 01:09:15,655
You have to kill him.

1227
01:09:15,656 --> 01:09:17,706
What is that ?

1228
01:09:18,677 --> 01:09:20,677
You...

1229
01:09:20,965 --> 01:09:22,525
What do you have in mind?

1230
01:09:22,526 --> 01:09:25,126
Are you kidding or what? - No.

1231
01:09:25,127 --> 01:09:26,827
What about you ?

1232
01:09:26,834 --> 01:09:32,174
If you do not like weapons, an accident will do.

1233
01:09:32,196 --> 01:09:35,796
An accident, it does not bother you?

1234
01:09:35,882 --> 01:09:38,462
It's over, Bhura's all over.

1235
01:09:38,463 --> 01:09:39,703
No no.

1236
01:09:39,704 --> 01:09:43,805
No, I'll kill myself. - No, brother.

1237
01:09:43,806 --> 01:09:45,156
No, it is not finished.

1238
01:09:45,157 --> 01:09:47,822
Romeo Must Die. - No no.

1239
01:09:47,823 --> 01:09:50,523
Go, tell it to Binny.

1240
01:09:50,524 --> 01:09:54,144
Romeo Must Die. - Do not say that, brother.

1241
01:09:54,146 --> 01:09:55,846
Do not talk like that.

1242
01:09:55,847 --> 01:09:58,317
We will kill Rahul.

1243
01:09:58,318 --> 01:09:59,458
We will kill him.

1244
01:09:59,459 --> 01:10:00,787
Bhur ...

1245
01:10:00,789 --> 01:10:02,190
Now ...

1246
01:10:02,190 --> 01:10:07,049
Now the hero of each film must be called Gattu .

1247
01:10:07,050 --> 01:10:08,060
Comment ?

1248
01:10:08,061 --> 01:10:09,821
Gattu .

1249
01:10:09,822 --> 01:10:11,822
Rahul K

1250
01:10:11,982 --> 01:10:13,012
Gattu , ...

1251
01:10:13,013 --> 01:10:14,522
Gattu will be the hero.

1252
01:10:14,523 --> 01:10:16,023
Gattu will be the hero?

1253
01:10:16,024 --> 01:10:19,024
 Gattu ...

1254
01:10:19,025 --> 01:10:21,145
The brother of Gattu? This is Bhura.

1255
01:10:21,146 --> 01:10:22,016
Bhur ...

1256
01:10:22,017 --> 01:10:23,647
Bhura, you will be the brother of Gattu.

1257
01:10:23,648 --> 01:10:25,078
Brother, Binny's my sister.

1258
01:10:25,079 --> 01:10:27,979
And Jaydev ... one. - No.

1259
01:10:27,980 --> 01:10:31,330
He keeps telling me, you're my brother .

1260
01:10:31,331 --> 01:10:33,051
You are my brother .

1261
01:10:33,052 --> 01:10:35,202
I want to be her brother.

1262
01:10:35,203 --> 01:10:39,503
Brother, you're getting married and I will be your witness.

1263
01:10:39,504 --> 01:10:41,584
It will not come up in the Eiffel Tower.

1264
01:10:41,585 --> 01:10:45,635
It will rise in the Clock Tower.

1265
01:10:45,636 --> 01:10:46,996
Yes Yes.

1266
01:10:46,997 --> 01:10:50,687
It will go up in the clock tower, not the Eiffel Tower.

1267
01:10:50,698 --> 01:10:51,748
The girl goes ...

1268
01:10:51,749 --> 01:10:56,239
I mean, Binny go up in the tower with you.

1269
01:10:56,261 --> 01:10:57,331
Gattu is your brother.

1270
01:10:57,341 --> 01:10:58,901
Who me ? - You're my brother.

1271
01:10:58,902 --> 01:11:01,652
Gattu is your brother. - Gattu is my brother.

1272
01:11:01,653 --> 01:11:03,033
It's decided...

1273
01:11:03,034 --> 01:11:04,034
And Rahul ...

1274
01:11:04,035 --> 01:11:08,035
Rahul, you can consider him dead.

1275
01:11:10,628 --> 01:11:12,238
We must kill him.

1276
01:11:12,239 --> 01:11:14,038
We must end.

1277
01:11:14,039 --> 01:11:15,734
I want to sleep.

1278
01:11:15,735 --> 01:11:16,605
Who is here ?

1279
01:11:16,606 --> 01:11:19,706
What happens to the body?

1280
01:11:20,362 --> 01:11:24,212
Thrown into the river Gomti. - In the river!

1281
01:11:24,213 --> 01:11:26,313
Hey, young?

1282
01:11:28,022 --> 01:11:29,502
You drank wine?

1283
01:11:29,503 --> 01:11:31,923
No, it is not wine. - Some wine ?

1284
01:11:31,944 --> 01:11:32,874
What? - We drank ...

1285
01:11:32,875 --> 01:11:34,125
Uncle...

1286
01:11:34,126 --> 01:11:38,656
We drank to relieve pain, that's all.

1287
01:11:38,694 --> 01:11:41,294
You sleep, I'll talk to him.

1288
01:11:41,295 --> 01:11:42,960
What's happening ? - Listen, Bhura.

1289
01:11:42,961 --> 01:11:44,261
You're going to sleep, hein?

1290
01:11:44,262 --> 01:11:45,982
You sleep, right?

1291
01:11:45,983 --> 01:11:47,183
Uncle...

1292
01:11:47,184 --> 01:11:49,184
I have to go.

1293
01:11:49,417 --> 01:11:51,218
A moment. - Yes.

1294
01:11:51,219 --> 01:11:53,459
What is this bullshit? - Blarney?

1295
01:11:53,460 --> 01:11:54,369
Blarney?

1296
01:11:54,370 --> 01:11:55,470
Uncle...

1297
01:11:55,971 --> 01:11:56,915
Uncle...

1298
01:11:56,916 --> 01:11:59,116
Bhura has nothing to do with it.

1299
01:11:59,117 --> 01:12:02,287
Bhura is my friend. - His close friend.

1300
01:12:02,288 --> 01:12:05,933
Bhura wanted to kill him so that I get my love.

1301
01:12:05,934 --> 01:12:07,264
What? - Yes...

1302
01:12:07,265 --> 01:12:09,865
I'm discouraged. - I'll kill him.

1303
01:12:09,869 --> 01:12:12,149
Et Binny?

1304
01:12:12,160 --> 01:12:14,910
Binny, since childhood, Bhura.

1305
01:12:14,911 --> 01:12:16,581
Since childhood...

1306
01:12:16,582 --> 01:12:19,282
It's nothing in there.

1307
01:12:19,283 --> 01:12:20,753
What is it ? - Nothing.

1308
01:12:20,753 --> 01:12:22,053
Bhura, you sleep? - Yes.

1309
01:12:22,054 --> 01:12:23,851
Bhura, you sleep? - Yes.

1310
01:12:23,852 --> 01:12:25,952
You have to sleep.

1311
01:12:25,953 --> 01:12:26,903
I am going to sleep.

1312
01:12:26,904 --> 01:12:29,104
Uncle, I must go.

1313
01:12:29,113 --> 01:12:31,243
I have to go back home.

1314
01:12:31,244 --> 01:12:31,844
Yes.

1315
01:12:31,844 --> 01:12:34,914
Gattu listening, tell me first, which is Binny?

1316
01:12:34,915 --> 01:12:37,415
Binny, uncle?

1317
01:12:37,416 --> 01:12:39,316
Binny...

1318
01:12:39,317 --> 01:12:41,046
It is my love, is not it?

1319
01:12:41,047 --> 01:12:42,077
It's my love.

1320
01:12:42,078 --> 01:12:44,078
It is the love of his life.

1321
01:12:44,783 --> 01:12:47,783
Uncle, you'll know who she is.

1322
01:12:47,784 --> 01:12:49,984
When it comes to buy milk. - Milk ?

1323
01:12:49,985 --> 01:12:52,085
Yes...

1324
01:12:52,086 --> 01:12:54,086
The vigils prayers.

1325
01:12:54,102 --> 01:12:57,900
Lord Shiva.

1326
01:12:59,278 --> 01:13:01,278
Uncle, I'm sorry.

1327
01:13:01,279 --> 01:13:02,679
I have to go.

1328
01:13:02,680 --> 01:13:05,180
Uncle, rest, okay?

1329
01:13:05,502 --> 01:13:08,302
It's cold, you need to sleep too.

1330
01:13:08,303 --> 01:13:10,953
Bhura, do not kill him. - I did not kill him.

1331
01:13:10,954 --> 01:13:14,274
Bhura, do not kill him. - I did not kill him.

1332
01:13:14,275 --> 01:13:16,275
Good night, Uncle.

1333
01:13:20,142 --> 01:13:24,542
What is he talking about? - Leave him, he is unhappy.

1334
01:13:24,543 --> 01:13:25,843
His heart is broken.

1335
01:13:25,856 --> 01:13:27,666
On va kidnapper Binny.

1336
01:13:27,667 --> 01:13:28,957
Good night.

1337
01:13:28,958 --> 01:13:30,459
The information is true.

1338
01:13:30,460 --> 01:13:32,660
We only talk about this.

1339
01:13:32,661 --> 01:13:35,061
The girl is engaged to him by force.

1340
01:13:35,081 --> 01:13:36,861
The brother of the girl slapped Bhura.

1341
01:13:36,902 --> 01:13:39,642
How dare he slap Bhura?

1342
01:13:39,643 --> 01:13:42,173
I will destroy his family.

1343
01:13:42,174 --> 01:13:46,504
Uncle, it deserves a correction. - Come on, sit down.

1344
01:13:47,552 --> 01:13:48,752
Listen.

1345
01:13:48,753 --> 01:13:50,522
You all know.

1346
01:13:50,542 --> 01:13:55,022
We condemn marriage with foreigners!

1347
01:13:55,028 --> 01:13:56,288
That is why.

1348
01:13:56,289 --> 01:13:58,499
I have to see the brother of the girl.

1349
01:13:58,500 --> 01:14:00,299
It should include ...

1350
01:14:00,300 --> 01:14:04,100
That in the interests of her sister.

1351
01:14:04,100 --> 01:14:07,450
She must marry someone else.

1352
01:14:07,452 --> 01:14:09,152
To avoid any misunderstanding.

1353
01:14:09,153 --> 01:14:12,803
As for Bhura, if I see him prowling around the girl.

1354
01:14:12,804 --> 01:14:16,104
I will punish myself.

1355
01:14:16,605 --> 01:14:18,115
Hello, uncle.

1356
01:14:18,116 --> 01:14:20,916
Do you speak English before your uncle.

1357
01:14:20,917 --> 01:14:23,057
You can not greet in Hindi?

1358
01:14:23,058 --> 01:14:24,658
Who is Binny?

1359
01:14:24,669 --> 01:14:26,569
Come here.

1360
01:14:26,580 --> 01:14:28,805
I do not come. - Come on.

1361
01:14:28,806 --> 01:14:31,626
I do not come if you want, just yourself.

1362
01:14:31,627 --> 01:14:35,477
This is me coming? You'll see.

1363
01:14:35,478 --> 01:14:37,018
He fled the loose.

1364
01:14:37,019 --> 01:14:39,499
Bijender. - Yes.

1365
01:14:39,502 --> 01:14:41,902
Lead me to the brother of the girl.

1366
01:15:03,618 --> 01:15:05,138
Listen, Jaydev.

1367
01:15:05,139 --> 01:15:07,119
Jaydev, it's him.

1368
01:15:07,190 --> 01:15:08,850
Okay.

1369
01:15:08,851 --> 01:15:10,451
Listen, Jaydev.

1370
01:15:10,452 --> 01:15:12,032
The fact is that...

1371
01:15:12,033 --> 01:15:14,533
... your sister...

1372
01:15:20,142 --> 01:15:21,342
My uncle...

1373
01:15:21,353 --> 01:15:23,353
Listen to me first.

1374
01:15:23,354 --> 01:15:28,804
I slapped Bhura because he seduced my sister.

1375
01:15:28,805 --> 01:15:32,045
You would have done the same for me.

1376
01:15:32,046 --> 01:15:36,426
We are poor, but honorable, an impeccable reputation.

1377
01:15:36,567 --> 01:15:38,817
You, on the cons ...

1378
01:15:38,818 --> 01:15:40,768
... are a family of criminals.

1379
01:15:40,769 --> 01:15:45,299
Everyone is aware of your illegal activities.

1380
01:15:45,300 --> 01:15:48,600
I can not let my sister marry your son.

1381
01:15:48,601 --> 01:15:51,601
I'd rather strangle.

1382
01:15:51,602 --> 01:15:55,802
Uncle, the truth is bitter. - How dare you ?

1383
01:15:55,803 --> 01:15:57,703
Hey, Bijender! - Sorry.

1384
01:15:57,774 --> 01:15:59,824
Move back, stand away.

1385
01:15:59,825 --> 01:16:01,525
What is that ?

1386
01:16:01,526 --> 01:16:03,926
Remind me your name. - Jaydev.

1387
01:16:03,927 --> 01:16:05,927
Jydev ...

1388
01:16:06,449 --> 01:16:11,379
First, regarding the reputation of my family.

1389
01:16:11,380 --> 01:16:13,099
Yes you are right.

1390
01:16:13,100 --> 01:16:18,180
What about the illegal activities of my family.

1391
01:16:18,181 --> 01:16:21,260
Yes you are right.

1392
01:16:21,262 --> 01:16:26,142
No respectable father accepts such a family for her daughter.

1393
01:16:26,143 --> 01:16:28,243
Yes. - Well.

1394
01:16:28,302 --> 01:16:30,922
So listen to me. - Yes.

1395
01:16:30,923 --> 01:16:34,703
Your sister will be married to someone in my family.

1396
01:16:34,705 --> 01:16:36,375
Comment ?

1397
01:16:36,407 --> 01:16:37,291
What?

1398
01:16:37,292 --> 01:16:41,642
If she refuses to get married, I will not hesitate to kill.

1399
01:16:41,653 --> 01:16:45,223
Or attach to the end of the ceremony.

1400
01:16:45,224 --> 01:16:50,408
She married someone from my family. - How are you, uncle?

1401
01:16:51,023 --> 01:16:52,413
What is he saying ?

1402
01:16:52,414 --> 01:16:54,614
Hey, uncle. - Uncle

1403
01:16:54,615 --> 01:16:56,115
Listen to me, uncle.

1404
01:16:56,116 --> 01:16:58,116
What say you, uncle?

1405
01:16:58,117 --> 01:16:59,017
What do you say ?

1406
01:16:59,018 --> 01:17:00,818
Uncle, listen to me.

1407
01:17:00,819 --> 01:17:02,609
Stop beg.

1408
01:17:02,610 --> 01:17:05,580
I'll call the police, who think he is?

1409
01:17:05,601 --> 01:17:07,531
You're going to call the police? Call her.

1410
01:17:07,532 --> 01:17:08,492
Go.

1411
01:17:08,494 --> 01:17:11,364
Call the police, the army, everyone you want.

1412
01:17:11,365 --> 01:17:14,215
The decision of the uncle is irrevocable.

1413
01:17:14,216 --> 01:17:16,786
We will not let you take our daughters.

1414
01:17:16,807 --> 01:17:18,307
We can do everything.

1415
01:17:18,308 --> 01:17:20,728
Do what you want.

1416
01:17:20,729 --> 01:17:23,959
You'll see, we'll kidnap her wedding day.

1417
01:17:23,960 --> 01:17:26,560
I raised my sister as if she was my daughter.

1418
01:17:26,561 --> 01:17:29,031
I will not let you near him.

1419
01:17:29,032 --> 01:17:31,292
What are you going to do ?

1420
01:17:31,293 --> 01:17:32,573
You can not do anything.

1421
01:17:32,574 --> 01:17:33,574
Do you see it ?

1422
01:17:33,575 --> 01:17:35,875
He is a criminal.

1423
01:17:35,906 --> 01:17:36,956
Come back here.

1424
01:17:36,957 --> 01:17:39,427
Step aside. - Do not touch it.

1425
01:17:39,428 --> 01:17:40,588
That's your man?

1426
01:17:40,589 --> 01:17:43,289
It seems that your women are stronger than men.

1427
01:17:43,290 --> 01:17:45,090
I'll hit him.

1428
01:17:45,091 --> 01:17:47,091
Who threw that shoe?

1429
01:18:04,267 --> 01:18:05,017
Dhappi!

1430
01:18:05,018 --> 01:18:07,218
This is Dhappi, flee.

1431
01:18:07,242 --> 01:18:09,242
Go.

1432
01:18:56,512 --> 01:18:59,512
Hi to you ! - Be blessed.

1433
01:19:00,913 --> 01:19:04,013
It's about this girl.

1434
01:19:06,062 --> 01:19:09,462
Where does she live ? - It is there.

1435
01:19:21,159 --> 01:19:24,159
It will break loose.

1436
01:19:36,520 --> 01:19:41,350
It is decided, Bhura going to marry that girl.

1437
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:45,320
If anyone objects to this marriage.

1438
01:19:45,321 --> 01:19:49,611
I will bring the area to fire and blood.

1439
01:19:50,042 --> 01:19:53,002
Ajju, calm down. - How does he dare ?

1440
01:19:53,004 --> 01:19:56,704
She is my sister and I have to protect her.

1441
01:19:56,706 --> 01:19:59,047
Let me out, I'll kill him.

1442
01:19:59,048 --> 01:20:00,798
I will kill Bhura.

1443
01:20:00,802 --> 01:20:03,317
Mom, I'm very angry.

1444
01:20:03,318 --> 01:20:04,298
Binny.

1445
01:20:04,299 --> 01:20:06,299
It's all because of you.

1446
01:20:06,319 --> 01:20:08,034
Your younger brother is angry.

1447
01:20:08,035 --> 01:20:10,635
Your older brother is threatened.

1448
01:20:10,636 --> 01:20:14,036
Binny, you're a selfish girl.

1449
01:20:14,037 --> 01:20:19,076
Ritu, I have said many times that I have no relationship with Bhura.

1450
01:20:19,077 --> 01:20:20,257
Do me a favor.

1451
01:20:20,258 --> 01:20:22,658
Go see Gattu, it will tell you everything.

1452
01:20:22,659 --> 01:20:24,881
Binny, Gattu told your brother ...

1453
01:20:24,882 --> 01:20:27,501
... that you are in relation Bhura. - What?

1454
01:20:27,502 --> 01:20:31,672
Yes, Binny, Gattu told him that you have a relationship.

1455
01:20:31,674 --> 01:20:33,229
Cat him home?

1456
01:20:33,230 --> 01:20:34,819
Why do not you believe me?

1457
01:20:34,820 --> 01:20:36,160
Gattu, Gattu, Gattu ...

1458
01:20:36,161 --> 01:20:39,861
Gattu Nautiyal said you're having an affair with Bhura.

1459
01:20:39,862 --> 01:20:43,062
Binny, because of you, my marriage is in danger.

1460
01:20:43,063 --> 01:20:45,763
If I do not get married, I will not let anyone get married.

1461
01:20:45,764 --> 01:20:48,664
You are selfish.

1462
01:20:48,971 --> 01:20:52,261
What can I do to make my sisters marry?

1463
01:20:52,262 --> 01:20:56,622
They'll kidnap her. - How are you, they'll kidnap her ?

1464
01:20:56,644 --> 01:20:59,594
We're with you all will be well.

1465
01:20:59,614 --> 01:21:04,034
We must unite and stand together.

1466
01:21:04,035 --> 01:21:06,735
Monga, I mean.

1467
01:21:06,736 --> 01:21:08,936
I can continue. - Yes.

1468
01:21:09,385 --> 01:21:10,985
Thank you.

1469
01:21:11,263 --> 01:21:13,163
So, I said ...

1470
01:21:13,164 --> 01:21:17,274
What happened to Jaydev, it can happen to anyone.

1471
01:21:17,275 --> 01:21:19,545
Yes he is right. - Yes of course.

1472
01:21:19,546 --> 01:21:20,096
Yes.

1473
01:21:20,147 --> 01:21:23,597
Well, if we do nothing.

1474
01:21:23,598 --> 01:21:25,938
Things will get worse. -Yes.

1475
01:21:25,948 --> 01:21:28,798
Our task therefore is to protect the area.

1476
01:21:28,805 --> 01:21:30,305
Of course !

1477
01:21:30,306 --> 01:21:32,506
I have to talk to you.

1478
01:21:32,507 --> 01:21:33,557
You are right.

1479
01:21:33,558 --> 01:21:34,806
Ah, Binny...

1480
01:21:34,857 --> 01:21:38,117
Binny marry Rahul, whatever happens. - Of course.

1481
01:21:38,118 --> 01:21:42,588
If someone approaches Binny, one bursts his eyes.

1482
01:21:42,589 --> 01:21:44,389
What? - Nothing.

1483
01:21:46,091 --> 01:21:49,241
If they want war ...

1484
01:21:49,242 --> 01:21:52,592
... we will make them.

1485
01:21:52,633 --> 01:21:55,542
Yes. - We are ready.

1486
01:21:56,082 --> 01:21:57,562
Did you hear, Jaydev?

1487
01:21:57,563 --> 01:22:00,063
We are all with you.

1488
01:22:00,063 --> 01:22:02,573
You have all supported me.

1489
01:22:02,597 --> 01:22:06,537
Ask the blessing of the gods to fight these criminals.

1490
01:22:06,538 --> 01:22:08,216
Yes of course.

1491
01:22:08,232 --> 01:22:10,082
Let a little party.

1492
01:22:10,083 --> 01:22:14,703
Glory to the gods. - Glory to the gods.

1493
01:22:22,690 --> 01:22:25,301
Holy mother of God.

1494
01:22:26,953 --> 01:22:27,572
Mother...

1495
01:22:27,573 --> 01:22:32,283
Today, a great event, Mother Sherawali happens.

1496
01:22:32,284 --> 01:22:34,034
Mother Sherawali happens.

1497
01:22:34,035 --> 01:22:40,548
Mother carries the wishes of your faithful.

1498
01:22:40,549 --> 01:22:42,929
We are in your hands.

1499
01:22:42,930 --> 01:22:47,079
We are in your hands, give us your grace!

1500
01:22:47,110 --> 01:22:51,440
I am delighted. - Glory to the gods.

1501
01:22:51,441 --> 01:23:01,721
I am delighted to see your enchanting face.

We sing your praises and we parons you a red scarf.

1503
01:23:09,123 --> 01:23:13,404
Mother hears the prayers of those who bow down to you.

1504
01:23:13,425 --> 01:23:17,795
All the faithful danced in joy.

1505
01:23:17,796 --> 01:23:22,176
Everybody sing your praises.

1506
01:23:22,177 --> 01:23:23,987
Praise to the divine mother.

1507
01:23:23,988 --> 01:23:26,248
You are my world.

1508
01:23:26,259 --> 01:23:32,779
You are my refuge.

1509
01:23:32,780 --> 01:23:38,480
Oh Mother, hear our prayers and realize our dreams!

1510
01:23:40,881 --> 01:23:45,231
Sanctifying your name ...

1511
01:23:45,232 --> 01:23:50,132
Oh sanctifying your name, my dreams come true!

1512
01:23:50,133 --> 01:23:54,473
I am glad...

1513
01:23:54,493 --> 01:24:03,193
I am delighted to see your enchanting face.

1514
01:24:03,194 --> 01:24:05,843
Nice to see your enchanting face.

1515
01:24:05,844 --> 01:24:09,774
We sing your praises and we parons you a red scarf.

1516
01:24:09,775 --> 01:24:11,375
Glory to the mother.

1517
01:24:11,605 --> 01:24:13,705
Glory to the Divine Mother.

1518
01:24:13,706 --> 01:24:14,786
Glory to the mother.

1519
01:24:14,787 --> 01:24:18,427
Mother hears the prayers of those who bow down to you.

1520
01:24:18,428 --> 01:24:29,387
I am glad...

1521
01:24:29,388 --> 01:24:33,388
Glory to the mother.

1522
01:24:33,890 --> 01:24:42,290
I am delighted to see your enchanting face.

1523
01:24:42,291 --> 01:24:46,291
Nice to see your enchanting face.

1524
01:24:56,523 --> 01:24:58,383
Binny.

1525
01:24:58,384 --> 01:24:59,834
You is right?

1526
01:24:59,835 --> 01:25:01,780
Yes why ?

1527
01:25:01,781 --> 01:25:02,681
Nothing !

1528
01:25:02,682 --> 01:25:05,482
Enters and closes the door.

1529
01:25:07,502 --> 01:25:10,102
I close the door ? - Yes.

1530
01:25:14,403 --> 01:25:17,103
Come, sit down.

1531
01:25:21,502 --> 01:25:23,447
Binny...

1532
01:25:23,448 --> 01:25:26,048
Sorry about the other day.

1533
01:25:26,049 --> 01:25:28,759
Do not worry, I got it.

1534
01:25:28,760 --> 01:25:31,350
Sit down first.

1535
01:25:31,351 --> 01:25:34,451
You have already arranged everything.

1536
01:25:34,452 --> 01:25:37,942
Tell me, you drink coffee?

1537
01:25:39,943 --> 01:25:42,953
I will even poison of your hands.

1538
01:25:42,954 --> 01:25:45,004
Okay, good.

1539
01:25:45,005 --> 01:25:47,201
Let's go to the balcony.

1540
01:25:47,202 --> 01:25:49,202
On the balcony ?

1541
01:25:53,126 --> 01:25:56,826
Would you like a hug ? - Oh yes.

1542
01:25:58,102 --> 01:26:00,212
Let's ...

1543
01:26:00,213 --> 01:26:02,533
... a French kiss. - Oh yes.

1544
01:26:02,534 --> 01:26:05,534
Yes, a French kiss.

1545
01:26:08,092 --> 01:26:11,312
Binny, are you sure?

1546
01:26:11,313 --> 01:26:13,083
Yes.

1547
01:26:13,102 --> 01:26:14,522
Why not here ?

1548
01:26:14,555 --> 01:26:16,555
You can see us.

1549
01:26:16,556 --> 01:26:19,906
It's better on the balcony, right?

1550
01:26:19,907 --> 01:26:22,337
Yes it's sure.

1551
01:26:22,338 --> 01:26:23,038
Yes.

1552
01:26:23,039 --> 01:26:26,139
Let's go ? - Yes let's go.

1553
01:26:30,592 --> 01:26:31,882
Gattu.

1554
01:26:31,883 --> 01:26:33,713
Yes.

1555
01:26:35,862 --> 01:26:40,862
Why your mother said bad things about me?

1556
01:26:40,922 --> 01:26:42,882
What?

1557
01:26:42,883 --> 01:26:44,883
No, Binny, my mother said nothing.

1558
01:26:44,884 --> 01:26:49,584
Gossip, they are a tradition in your family?

1559
01:26:49,592 --> 01:26:51,192
Why do you say that, Binny?

1560
01:26:51,193 --> 01:26:53,019
Forget it.

1561
01:26:53,030 --> 01:26:57,030
The goddess, she is entering someone's body?

1562
01:26:57,031 --> 01:26:58,291
Forget it.

1563
01:26:58,292 --> 01:26:59,881
Tell me, Gattu.

1564
01:26:59,892 --> 01:27:02,392
Did she take possession of a body?

1565
01:27:02,393 --> 01:27:04,293
No why ?

1566
01:27:04,294 --> 01:27:06,134
It will not do.

1567
01:27:06,135 --> 01:27:09,554
Because she will come here.

1568
01:27:09,555 --> 01:27:11,555
She will come here?

1569
01:27:13,692 --> 01:27:15,692
Binny.

1570
01:27:16,510 --> 01:27:17,360
Binny.

1571
01:27:17,361 --> 01:27:18,561
Tell me, Gattu ...

1572
01:27:18,562 --> 01:27:22,361
... who spread this rumor Bhura and me?

1573
01:27:22,362 --> 01:27:24,062
Binny is ...

1574
01:27:24,063 --> 01:27:25,063
I said nothing.

1575
01:27:25,064 --> 01:27:29,824
Gattu, you are a coward and you'll stay.

1576
01:27:29,825 --> 01:27:31,765
It was you who said that to Jaydev?

1577
01:27:31,766 --> 01:27:33,655
Is it not, Gattu?

1578
01:27:33,656 --> 01:27:36,976
You betrayed the trust Binny? - No.

1579
01:27:36,977 --> 01:27:39,801
Gattu, you are a coward.

1580
01:27:39,802 --> 01:27:43,182
I have not told anyone. - You're lying to me !

1581
01:27:43,183 --> 01:27:46,683
No, Goddess, I am not lying.

1582
01:27:46,710 --> 01:27:50,810
Binny, see you with Rahul ...

1583
01:27:50,931 --> 01:27:52,331
What?

1584
01:27:52,332 --> 01:27:53,192
Gattu ...

1585
01:27:53,193 --> 01:27:54,293
Shut up.

1586
01:27:54,294 --> 01:27:56,343
Shut up, Gattu.

1587
01:27:56,344 --> 01:27:58,744
Why did you do it ?

1588
01:27:58,745 --> 01:28:01,465
We could conquer the world together.

1589
01:28:01,466 --> 01:28:04,496
Now I lost everything.

1590
01:28:04,502 --> 01:28:10,052
How many times have I asked you about Bhura?

1591
01:28:10,078 --> 01:28:14,968
You could at least think about my honor and respect my feelings.

1592
01:28:14,969 --> 01:28:17,999
Binny, I ... - What?

1593
01:28:24,017 --> 01:28:27,247
You destroyed my life. - Binny, do not say that.

1594
01:28:27,249 --> 01:28:29,249
Do not touch me.

1595
01:28:35,289 --> 01:28:37,339
I was going to say it.

1596
01:28:37,540 --> 01:28:39,660
Binny ?
Qu'a-t-elle, Binny ?

1597
01:28:39,661 --> 01:28:42,661
Gattu, what did it, Binny? - It is owned.

1598
01:28:42,662 --> 01:28:44,662
What happened to my sister?

1599
01:28:44,663 --> 01:28:45,818
Binny.

1600
01:28:45,819 --> 01:28:47,019
Gattu brings water.

1601
01:28:47,020 --> 01:28:48,820
Call Jaydev.

1602
01:28:48,922 --> 01:28:49,830
Binny.

1603
01:28:49,832 --> 01:28:52,332
Binny, wake up, sister.

1604
01:28:54,433 --> 01:28:56,872
Doctor. - She has nothing.

1605
01:28:56,873 --> 01:29:00,313
Do not worry, she's fine.

1606
01:29:00,314 --> 01:29:03,084
Possession is the cause of all this.

1607
01:29:03,085 --> 01:29:05,085
It's the season !

1608
01:29:05,589 --> 01:29:09,219
This will relieve tranquilizer.

1609
01:29:09,220 --> 01:29:10,620
Doctor, your fees?

1610
01:29:10,621 --> 01:29:13,321
No fees to pay.

1611
01:29:13,431 --> 01:29:16,798
I do not demand fees for cases of possessions.

1612
01:29:16,799 --> 01:29:19,899
Let us pray the Gods. - Glory to the gods.

1613
01:29:28,176 --> 01:29:32,676
No, child, no one will say anything.

1614
01:29:32,678 --> 01:29:34,417
Do not worry.

1615
01:29:34,418 --> 01:29:36,193
Everything will be perfect.

1616
01:29:36,194 --> 01:29:37,769
Do not Cry.

1617
01:29:37,770 --> 01:29:39,770
Go.

1618
01:29:41,322 --> 01:29:43,332
Two with sticks. - No sticks.

1619
01:29:43,333 --> 01:29:47,533
Two guys with guns at the door of Binny and two in the hallway.

1620
01:29:47,534 --> 01:29:49,134
Tell me, Tirchu. - Speak.

1621
01:29:49,135 --> 01:29:52,985
How many men and weapons, willing you?

1622
01:29:52,986 --> 01:29:56,167
I have five men with rifles and ten with sticks.

1623
01:29:56,168 --> 01:29:58,142
Ten five with sticks and with guns?

1624
01:29:58,143 --> 01:30:00,703
Hey Gattu! Tirchu pay tribute to uncle.

1625
01:30:00,704 --> 01:30:03,404
Be blessed my child, sit down.

1626
01:30:03,405 --> 01:30:06,690
Tirchu, everyone can have sticks.

1627
01:30:06,691 --> 01:30:09,414
Mets with seven firearms. - Okay.

1628
01:30:09,415 --> 01:30:13,815
I want two miles for every man and three miles for weapons.

1629
01:30:13,816 --> 01:30:15,916
OK.

1630
01:30:15,917 --> 01:30:18,662
Here is a down payment, the rest after the wedding.

1631
01:30:18,663 --> 01:30:24,413
Binny and Jaydev should be under close supervision.

1632
01:30:24,414 --> 01:30:28,214
Okay, do not worry. - Hello.

1633
01:30:31,166 --> 01:30:33,166
Cat sois béni.

1634
01:30:35,068 --> 01:30:36,643
Health.

1635
01:30:36,644 --> 01:30:38,774
What is it ?

1636
01:30:38,775 --> 01:30:39,875
Uncle.

1637
01:30:39,876 --> 01:30:42,475
There is a misconception about Binny.

1638
01:30:42,476 --> 01:30:43,926
Binny ?

1639
01:30:43,927 --> 01:30:45,787
Oh, this girl?

1640
01:30:45,788 --> 01:30:48,388
What's the misunderstanding? - Uncle, Bhura ...

1641
01:30:48,389 --> 01:30:50,139
Do not worry about that.

1642
01:30:50,140 --> 01:30:52,280
Dhappi just been released from prison.

1643
01:30:52,281 --> 01:30:54,811
It is being pampered son.

1644
01:30:54,812 --> 01:30:57,742
Since you are friends, he will pamper you too.

1645
01:30:57,743 --> 01:30:59,343
vas-y!

1646
01:31:03,552 --> 01:31:06,452
Dad, I have sore legs.

1647
01:31:09,442 --> 01:31:11,842
You want to marry outside our family?

1648
01:31:11,843 --> 01:31:15,283
Have you thought about the impact it would have on the family?

1649
01:31:15,284 --> 01:31:17,684
You thought about it?

1650
01:31:18,586 --> 01:31:20,586
You!

1651
01:31:21,258 --> 01:31:23,098
Take a seat. - Sorry.

1652
01:31:23,099 --> 01:31:26,209
Your people have used Tirchu.

1653
01:31:26,210 --> 01:31:27,970
Tirchu?

1654
01:31:27,971 --> 01:31:31,041
Dhappi can crush Tirchu by blowing on it.

1655
01:31:31,042 --> 01:31:32,272
Yes I know it.

1656
01:31:32,273 --> 01:31:34,573
I came out of prison a week ago.

1657
01:31:34,609 --> 01:31:37,659
So, I'll kill a few.

1658
01:31:37,660 --> 01:31:39,660
Listen to me.

1659
01:31:40,592 --> 01:31:42,992
You two are close friends.

1660
01:31:42,993 --> 01:31:45,203
As in the movie Sholay .

1661
01:31:45,204 --> 01:31:48,624
You and Bhura have grown up together. - Yes.

1662
01:31:48,660 --> 01:31:51,560
I do not want you to become an orphan.

1663
01:31:51,561 --> 01:31:54,161
So tell your father to drop.

1664
01:31:54,162 --> 01:31:56,142
Otherwise, I kill him. - Yes.

1665
01:31:56,143 --> 01:31:57,283
Including ? - Yes.

1666
01:31:57,295 --> 01:31:59,295
Where is...

1667
01:31:59,296 --> 01:32:02,376
Where is this girl who is the cause of all this?

1668
01:32:02,377 --> 01:32:05,577
Lead me to it. - Uncle ...

1669
01:32:06,578 --> 01:32:08,778
Lead me to it or I kidnaps.

1670
01:32:08,779 --> 01:32:12,109
Yes, uncle, I'll lead you to it.

1671
01:32:16,403 --> 01:32:19,623
Talk to your father and be done.

1672
01:32:19,624 --> 01:32:24,124
Brother, I was raised by my mother without really knowing my father.

1673
01:32:24,146 --> 01:32:26,376
He was always in jail.

1674
01:32:26,377 --> 01:32:30,097
I do not know how he was released.

1675
01:32:30,098 --> 01:32:34,228
My maternal uncle fled with a girl.

1676
01:32:34,229 --> 01:32:35,168
He killed her.

1677
01:32:35,169 --> 01:32:38,569
My father was killed in front of my mother.

1678
01:32:38,972 --> 01:32:42,412
Honor crimes are still perpetuated in my family.

1679
01:32:42,413 --> 01:32:44,833
I can not help it, it's a matter of honor.

1680
01:32:44,834 --> 01:32:48,834
If I oppose, I will be killed.

1681
01:32:50,522 --> 01:32:52,272
I see three dead bodies.

1682
01:32:52,273 --> 01:32:54,693
Yours, mine and that of Binny.

1683
01:32:54,694 --> 01:32:56,684
No, there is a fourth body.

1684
01:32:56,685 --> 01:32:58,685
This is Nautiyal uncle.

1685
01:33:00,067 --> 01:33:02,167
What can I do ?

1686
01:33:03,598 --> 01:33:06,098
It's up to you.

1687
01:33:10,537 --> 01:33:13,807
Save at least your father.

1688
01:33:13,808 --> 01:33:18,418
Mr. Monga, we have neither president nor vice president.

1689
01:33:18,420 --> 01:33:20,702
We must be united to defend us.

1690
01:33:20,703 --> 01:33:22,033
I agree, Mr Nautiyal.

1691
01:33:22,044 --> 01:33:23,994
But we are peaceful people.

1692
01:33:23,995 --> 01:33:26,394
While they are killers.

1693
01:33:26,395 --> 01:33:27,065
U.S. too.

1694
01:33:27,066 --> 01:33:29,895
We must learn to defend ourselves. - How?

1695
01:33:29,896 --> 01:33:32,836
By killing a first and a second ... - Dad.

1696
01:33:32,838 --> 01:33:34,363
Yes talk.

1697
01:33:34,364 --> 01:33:35,514
Hi, uncle. - Hi.

1698
01:33:35,515 --> 01:33:37,405
What is it ? - Can I talk to you?

1699
01:33:37,406 --> 01:33:39,706
A second. - Yes.

1700
01:33:44,117 --> 01:33:45,997
What is it ?

1701
01:33:45,998 --> 01:33:48,118
I come from Dhappi.

1702
01:33:48,124 --> 01:33:51,174
He had threatened to kill you.

1703
01:33:51,175 --> 01:33:52,764
You are my only father.

1704
01:33:52,765 --> 01:33:54,175
I am an orphan.

1705
01:33:54,176 --> 01:33:56,876
And my mother is a widow.

1706
01:33:57,242 --> 01:33:59,582
You never hurt anyone.

1707
01:33:59,583 --> 01:34:01,983
Why all of this ?

1708
01:34:01,984 --> 01:34:03,984
Please, Dad.

1709
01:34:03,985 --> 01:34:06,385
Follow me.

1710
01:34:11,522 --> 01:34:12,672
What is that ?

1711
01:34:12,673 --> 01:34:13,873
It is...

1712
01:34:13,874 --> 01:34:16,074
It's the White House.

1713
01:34:16,202 --> 01:34:19,002
The home of America's president.

1714
01:34:19,394 --> 01:34:21,654
I want to be president.

1715
01:34:22,255 --> 01:34:24,535
No vice president.

1716
01:34:24,536 --> 01:34:26,506
Who remembers the vice president?

1717
01:34:26,507 --> 01:34:27,377
Nobody.

1718
01:34:27,378 --> 01:34:31,258
Lemon accompanying the tandoori chicken.

1719
01:34:31,259 --> 01:34:33,529
Who remembers?

1720
01:34:33,530 --> 01:34:36,050
Everyone talks about the chicken.

1721
01:34:36,051 --> 01:34:37,791
Who am I ?

1722
01:34:37,792 --> 01:34:39,792
Nutiyl?

1723
01:34:39,793 --> 01:34:41,343
I am the lemon.

1724
01:34:41,344 --> 01:34:42,564
Citron.

1725
01:34:42,565 --> 01:34:44,115
I have become a chicken.

1726
01:34:44,116 --> 01:34:45,516
And to be a chicken.

1727
01:34:45,540 --> 01:34:49,540
Everything I need is a war.

1728
01:34:51,832 --> 01:34:54,232
Father and son Bush, what did they do?

1729
01:34:54,233 --> 01:34:55,402
The war.

1730
01:34:55,403 --> 01:34:59,103
When people are bored, they wage war.

1731
01:34:59,109 --> 01:35:02,839
And after the war, a new leader appears.

1732
01:35:02,840 --> 01:35:04,380
At the end of the matter.

1733
01:35:04,381 --> 01:35:08,251
I'll be the leader of this district.

1734
01:35:08,252 --> 01:35:10,852
Are you afraid of a mere threat?

1735
01:35:10,853 --> 01:35:13,353
Fils de Nautiyal?

1736
01:35:13,843 --> 01:35:15,623
You're probably surprised.

1737
01:35:15,624 --> 01:35:20,624
Do not forget that I was a real hard in college.

1738
01:35:21,216 --> 01:35:23,916
I closed the city for sixteen days.

1739
01:35:23,917 --> 01:35:28,817
A curfew was declared by Hemchander Nautiyal.

1740
01:35:29,419 --> 01:35:31,099
No need to be afraid.

1741
01:35:31,100 --> 01:35:32,210
One more thing...

1742
01:35:32,211 --> 01:35:35,441
You must stay on good terms with Bhura.

1743
01:35:35,442 --> 01:35:40,712
We need information about the strength of the enemy.

1744
01:35:41,023 --> 01:35:45,546
Continue to tell me what's going on there.

1745
01:35:45,547 --> 01:35:47,547
Mr. Monga.

1746
01:35:49,407 --> 01:35:51,607
It's beautiful, but too expensive, Mom.

1747
01:35:51,608 --> 01:35:55,028
Binny, take it, it is superb.

1748
01:35:55,041 --> 01:35:57,671
Look at that one. - That one.

1749
01:35:58,773 --> 01:36:00,673
Hello, uncle. - Gattu.

1750
01:36:00,674 --> 01:36:01,634
I arrive.

1751
01:36:01,655 --> 01:36:04,655
It's pretty, make us see others saris.

1752
01:36:08,725 --> 01:36:10,015
Welcome, uncle.

1753
01:36:10,016 --> 01:36:12,666
Uncle, I want to ask you something.

1754
01:36:12,667 --> 01:36:15,687
Can you see far? -Shut up.

1755
01:36:15,688 --> 01:36:17,318
Why far?

1756
01:36:17,319 --> 01:36:19,949
I want to see up close.

1757
01:36:19,950 --> 01:36:22,140
Listen to me carefully...

1758
01:36:22,141 --> 01:36:25,931
I have to see the girl before giving my consent.

1759
01:36:25,932 --> 01:36:28,232
The opinion of Bhura has no value.

1760
01:36:28,243 --> 01:36:30,643
Okay, but ... - You talk a lot.

1761
01:36:30,644 --> 01:36:32,644
Shut up.

1762
01:36:32,924 --> 01:36:35,354
Where is the girl ?

1763
01:36:35,355 --> 01:36:36,415
It's that one ?

1764
01:36:36,416 --> 01:36:38,716
Uncle there.

1765
01:36:38,717 --> 01:36:40,317
Where is she ?

1766
01:36:41,327 --> 01:36:43,327
There she is. - Or ?

1767
01:36:43,379 --> 01:36:46,479
She dressed in yellow. - this one ?

1768
01:36:46,881 --> 01:36:49,151
It's that girl?

1769
01:36:49,152 --> 01:36:50,702
Yes.

1770
01:36:50,703 --> 01:36:52,703
It's that girl?

1771
01:36:54,675 --> 01:36:56,675
She is very beautiful.

1772
01:36:56,676 --> 01:37:00,376
A gorgeous girl! What a guy!

1773
01:37:00,377 --> 01:37:03,857
Tell me the truth, or I will kill you.

1774
01:37:03,858 --> 01:37:08,058
This girl really loves my son Bhura?

1775
01:37:10,020 --> 01:37:13,360
I know that diamonds are carbon.

1776
01:37:13,371 --> 01:37:16,591
But this does not explain the love diamond for my son.

1777
01:37:16,596 --> 01:37:19,196
It's strange.

1778
01:37:19,197 --> 01:37:21,247
I will bless my daughter. - No.

1779
01:37:21,248 --> 01:37:22,248
I must bless.

1780
01:37:22,249 --> 01:37:24,859
No, not now.

1781
01:37:24,860 --> 01:37:28,560
I have to give her a present. - Uncle ... Uncle.

1782
01:37:28,561 --> 01:37:30,701
How to leave without talking to her?

1783
01:37:30,702 --> 01:37:33,802
I beg you, Uncle, it's a matter of honor.

1784
01:37:33,803 --> 01:37:37,163
Okay, since you're her brother, give her that.

1785
01:37:37,164 --> 01:37:38,761
Ok !

1786
01:37:38,762 --> 01:37:40,112
Give it to her. - Yes.

1787
01:37:40,113 --> 01:37:42,713
Do not forget to give it to her. - Yes.

1788
01:37:46,445 --> 01:37:48,845
Choose the saari you want.

1789
01:37:48,846 --> 01:37:51,346
Binny loved it.

1790
01:37:51,347 --> 01:37:52,887
Its color is very beautiful.

1791
01:37:52,888 --> 01:37:55,188
Binny, I want to talk to you.

1792
01:37:57,590 --> 01:38:00,220
The child missed the Nautiyal uncle.

1793
01:38:00,221 --> 01:38:02,301
Stop following me.

1794
01:38:02,302 --> 01:38:04,642
I know you have nothing to do.

1795
01:38:04,643 --> 01:38:09,283
So I thought you could use the juice for my wedding.

1796
01:38:09,284 --> 01:38:10,774
Binny ... Please, Will in.

1797
01:38:12,046 --> 01:38:13,447
Mom, is not it pretty?

1798
01:38:13,448 --> 01:38:19,748
Look how beautiful is the bindi on the forehead of the bride.

1799
01:38:19,769 --> 01:38:24,419
Look how beautiful the bindi bride.

1800
01:38:25,412 --> 01:38:27,312
Yes.

1801
01:38:30,293 --> 01:38:32,193
Ajju, answer the phone.

1802
01:38:32,194 --> 01:38:34,234
Binny, it is busy.

1803
01:38:34,235 --> 01:38:38,135
Gattu, brother, give him the phone, please.

1804
01:38:41,378 --> 01:38:47,878
Watch as the anklet of the bride is beautiful.

1805
01:38:49,115 --> 01:38:50,345
Hello.

1806
01:38:50,346 --> 01:38:51,646
Hi Rahul.

1807
01:38:51,647 --> 01:38:55,597
Where are you, I miss you?

1808
01:38:55,598 --> 01:38:58,598
Tell me, have you finished your shopping?

1809
01:38:58,602 --> 01:38:59,719
Yes, I finished.

1810
01:38:59,720 --> 01:39:01,388
Send me photos.

1811
01:39:01,389 --> 01:39:02,220
What pictures ?

1812
01:39:02,221 --> 01:39:04,191
Those of your clothes.

1813
01:39:04,192 --> 01:39:06,192
Oh !

1814
01:39:06,322 --> 01:39:09,192
But first, give me a hug.

1815
01:39:09,193 --> 01:39:10,793
What do you mean ?

1816
01:39:10,794 --> 01:39:15,794
You live in France, I guess you want a French kiss.

1817
01:39:15,856 --> 01:39:18,796
Tell me you do not want.

1818
01:39:18,797 --> 01:39:21,297
Not now, I'm in henna ceremony.

1819
01:39:21,298 --> 01:39:23,308
Make a list and I will do.

1820
01:39:23,309 --> 01:39:27,804
My list is long, it would take a lifetime.

1821
01:39:27,824 --> 01:39:28,824
Non.

1822
01:39:28,825 --> 01:39:33,045
Look how beautiful is the bindi on the forehead of the bride.

1823
01:39:33,046 --> 01:39:37,046
Look how beautiful the bindi bride.

1824
01:39:50,798 --> 01:39:52,728
Gattu ...

1825
01:39:52,729 --> 01:39:54,509
Gattu, what is it?

1826
01:39:54,510 --> 01:39:55,950
Brother Gattu.

1827
01:39:55,951 --> 01:39:57,951
What is it ?

1828
01:39:59,082 --> 01:40:01,082
Have you got your gun? - Yes.

1829
01:40:01,083 --> 01:40:05,533
Why this sudden change? - You were right that day.

1830
01:40:05,534 --> 01:40:08,134
He had to kill Rahul.

1831
01:40:10,599 --> 01:40:13,369
Do not waste time, give me the gun.

1832
01:40:13,370 --> 01:40:17,170
Brother, he's with me, take it.

1833
01:40:18,202 --> 01:40:21,142
But it is useless to kill Rahul.

1834
01:40:21,143 --> 01:40:23,793
Binny will not marry Rahul.

1835
01:40:23,794 --> 01:40:26,994
Binny will marry me.

1836
01:40:27,102 --> 01:40:31,172
Why have you taken my father see Binny?

1837
01:40:31,342 --> 01:40:33,562
He lost his head.

1838
01:40:33,563 --> 01:40:35,527
He chose the names of our children.

1839
01:40:35,528 --> 01:40:40,528
He wants to become a grandfather and playing with his grandchildren son.

1840
01:40:41,828 --> 01:40:47,128
He sent the uncle Gajender offer gifts of marriage.

1841
01:40:47,847 --> 01:40:49,997
Brother...

1842
01:40:50,031 --> 01:40:52,711
Only my death can stop this chaos.

1843
01:40:52,712 --> 01:40:54,732
Kill me. - No, Bhura.

1844
01:40:54,733 --> 01:40:56,833
Kill me, brother, kill me.

1845
01:40:57,234 --> 01:40:59,234
Not you !

1846
01:41:01,052 --> 01:41:05,352
You're all I have left.

1847
01:41:10,444 --> 01:41:13,244
Gattu, mon ami ...

1848
01:41:13,245 --> 01:41:15,645
You do not deserve that.

1849
01:41:15,726 --> 01:41:19,626
Why does not want me?

1850
01:41:24,462 --> 01:41:26,912
You see, Bhura ...

1851
01:41:26,913 --> 01:41:31,013
Binny always thought that I'm a liar and a bum.

1852
01:41:31,014 --> 01:41:33,014
Yes.

1853
01:41:33,031 --> 01:41:35,131
Wait and see.

1854
01:41:35,132 --> 01:41:39,082
I planned something special for Binny.

1855
01:41:39,083 --> 01:41:41,233
Who will not be forgotten anytime soon by Binny Arora.

1856
01:41:41,234 --> 01:41:45,004
The wedding Bhura and Binny is decided.

1857
01:41:45,005 --> 01:41:48,005
Even God can not cancel.

1858
01:41:48,006 --> 01:41:49,306
Et Dhappi ...

1859
01:41:49,307 --> 01:41:50,986
He can not forget the humiliation.

1860
01:41:50,987 --> 01:41:53,747
One of your women launched a shoe.

1861
01:41:53,748 --> 01:41:59,558
Yesterday, he was attacked by delivering gifts.

1862
01:41:59,559 --> 01:42:01,385
Your father...

1863
01:42:01,386 --> 01:42:04,314
Your father is their leader?

1864
01:42:04,315 --> 01:42:05,605
Listen, Gattu.

1865
01:42:05,606 --> 01:42:07,666
Your father must die, that's all.

1866
01:42:07,667 --> 01:42:10,287
I have to kill him.

1867
01:42:10,352 --> 01:42:15,512
I'll kill the wedding morning, okay? - Okay, uncle.

1868
01:42:15,913 --> 01:42:20,233
I have a letter from Binny's father Bhura.

1869
01:42:20,235 --> 01:42:21,965
Who is the father of Bhura?

1870
01:42:21,966 --> 01:42:25,466
Father, it's you. - I am your father ?

1871
01:42:27,082 --> 01:42:29,332
Uncle, I'll read it.

1872
01:42:29,333 --> 01:42:31,333
I can ? - Yes.

1873
01:42:32,527 --> 01:42:34,447
respected father.

1874
01:42:34,448 --> 01:42:35,798
Salutations.

1875
01:42:35,803 --> 01:42:37,633
My uncle, greetings.

1876
01:42:37,639 --> 01:42:38,989
Be blessed.

1877
01:42:38,990 --> 01:42:41,490
Uncle Bijender and Gajender, my greetings.

1878
01:42:41,502 --> 01:42:45,931
I'm fine and I hope you are well.

1879
01:42:45,932 --> 01:42:50,377
Gattu is brave, intelligent and trustworthy.

1880
01:42:50,378 --> 01:42:53,948
After consultation with Gattu, I decided that as soon as Ritu ...

1881
01:42:53,949 --> 01:42:55,852
Ritu is her older sister.

1882
01:42:55,868 --> 01:42:57,838
When Ritu marry.

1883
01:42:57,839 --> 01:43:01,869
I'll run away with Gattu and I will come to marry Bhura.

1884
01:43:01,870 --> 01:43:03,150
It's a good idea.

1885
01:43:03,151 --> 01:43:10,251
This is the only way to avoid a bloodbath.

1886
01:43:11,522 --> 01:43:14,282
I'm sorry for Bijender uncle.

1887
01:43:14,283 --> 01:43:17,283
Your future daughter-Binny.

1888
01:43:24,122 --> 01:43:26,452
This is a very nice letter.

1889
01:43:26,453 --> 01:43:30,193
All I got was convocations.

1890
01:43:30,202 --> 01:43:33,652
Bhura, I'm proud of you.

1891
01:43:33,952 --> 01:43:38,452
Finally, this idiot has found a real gem.

1892
01:43:38,453 --> 01:43:41,523
She is beautiful and very intelligent.

1893
01:43:41,524 --> 01:43:44,584
Listen, I will do as she said.

1894
01:43:44,585 --> 01:43:46,285
Yes it's good.

1895
01:43:46,302 --> 01:43:47,200
Listening.

1896
01:43:47,201 --> 01:43:49,201
Come here.

1897
01:43:50,082 --> 01:43:53,202
You will accompany the bride at the wedding of Bhura.

1898
01:43:53,203 --> 01:43:54,732
Nobody is better than you.

1899
01:43:54,733 --> 01:43:56,368
Hé Dhappi!

1900
01:43:56,370 --> 01:43:58,195
This is the father to do that.

1901
01:43:58,196 --> 01:44:02,166
I said that her brother was going to do, then he will do it, that's all.

1902
01:44:02,167 --> 01:44:04,367
Uncle, I'm his neighbor.

1903
01:44:04,368 --> 01:44:06,968
You're a good brother.

1904
01:44:08,265 --> 01:44:10,195
Binny my angel.

1905
01:44:10,196 --> 01:44:12,556
I begin with a poem, and I say hello.

1906
01:44:12,617 --> 01:44:14,617
Health.

1907
01:44:15,562 --> 01:44:17,812
My love for you is a burning fire.

1908
01:44:17,860 --> 01:44:22,770
If we do not get married, everything will burn in a fiery blaze.

1909
01:44:22,772 --> 01:44:25,302
Fortunately, your brother is single.

1910
01:44:25,303 --> 01:44:27,903
If he was married ...

1911
01:44:28,202 --> 01:44:29,652
Continue.

1912
01:44:30,553 --> 01:44:34,553
If he was married, his wife would be a widow.

1913
01:44:34,652 --> 01:44:39,582
Fear not, especially not the father of Gattu.

1914
01:44:39,583 --> 01:44:43,213
My father will kill him first.

1915
01:44:43,214 --> 01:44:44,023
What?

1916
01:44:44,024 --> 01:44:46,024
I warned you.

1917
01:44:47,026 --> 01:44:53,636
Cherie, who opposed and tried to prevent the marriage.

1918
01:44:53,637 --> 01:44:56,797
Bhura and his family will kill him.

1919
01:44:56,798 --> 01:45:00,798
I will come to free you from this hell.

1920
01:45:02,137 --> 01:45:09,217
I have a contact there, it will inform you of our arrival.

1921
01:45:09,572 --> 01:45:12,552
Who is it ? - I do not know.

1922
01:45:13,602 --> 01:45:17,602
Your love, Bhura.

1923
01:45:19,054 --> 01:45:21,534
He asked me to deliver the letter to Binny.

1924
01:45:21,535 --> 01:45:25,135
I thought I would let you know after reading it.

1925
01:45:25,136 --> 01:45:27,586
Binny is a hothead.

1926
01:45:27,587 --> 01:45:31,787
I hope she does not run away. - Brother, one minute.

1927
01:45:31,789 --> 01:45:34,919
Binny will fly over my dead body.

1928
01:45:34,920 --> 01:45:37,020
I am with you.

1929
01:45:37,592 --> 01:45:39,952
Gattu, stay here and do not move.

1930
01:45:39,953 --> 01:45:41,833
Watch her.

1931
01:45:41,834 --> 01:45:43,513
It should tell anyone.

1932
01:45:43,514 --> 01:45:45,884
But brother ... - Shut up.

1933
01:45:45,885 --> 01:45:50,185
I'm doing this to save your marriage.

1934
01:46:02,764 --> 01:46:06,164
It's not my fault.

1935
01:46:16,366 --> 01:46:18,666
Turn off the light.

1936
01:46:22,272 --> 01:46:24,572
Turn off the light.

1937
01:46:42,572 --> 01:46:44,022
Hello.

1938
01:46:44,023 --> 01:46:46,223
The police station ?

1939
01:46:47,054 --> 01:46:48,904
A second.

1940
01:46:48,905 --> 01:46:51,105
M. Tirchu ... M. Tirchu Pehelwaan ...

1941
01:46:51,106 --> 01:46:53,906
You have not kept your promise.

1942
01:46:53,927 --> 01:46:57,157
There are few men here, you have to double the guard.

1943
01:46:57,158 --> 01:46:58,508
What are you saying ?

1944
01:46:58,509 --> 01:47:00,529
Do not worry, everything will be fine.

1945
01:47:00,540 --> 01:47:01,010
Hey, Jydev.

1946
01:47:01,011 --> 01:47:03,631
Gattu, you have to stay near Binny.

1947
01:47:03,632 --> 01:47:05,052
Binny se change.

1948
01:47:05,053 --> 01:47:08,593
Rest at his door, please. - Okay, take this.

1949
01:47:08,594 --> 01:47:10,429
Do not worry, everything is in place.

1950
01:47:10,430 --> 01:47:12,230
Jaydev, the police are outside.

1951
01:47:12,231 --> 01:47:13,091
The police ? - Yes.

1952
01:47:13,092 --> 01:47:14,092
The police ? - Yes.

1953
01:47:14,122 --> 01:47:16,722
One moment, I'll talk to them.

1954
01:47:20,263 --> 01:47:21,013
What, sir?

1955
01:47:21,014 --> 01:47:23,274
We heard threats, what is it?

1956
01:47:23,275 --> 01:47:24,485
What, Inspector?

1957
01:47:24,491 --> 01:47:25,711
It is for you to tell me.

1958
01:47:25,712 --> 01:47:27,912
They planned to detonate a bomb.

1959
01:47:27,913 --> 01:47:29,753
What do you mean ?

1960
01:47:29,754 --> 01:47:33,764
It's a marriage is serious, who are these people?

1961
01:47:33,765 --> 01:47:36,265
Let me do.

1962
01:47:37,457 --> 01:47:38,801
What's all this?

1963
01:47:38,802 --> 01:47:41,752
You know when a girl marries.

1964
01:47:41,769 --> 01:47:45,079
The rejected lovers spread such rumors.

1965
01:47:45,080 --> 01:47:46,500
What do you want, Binny?

1966
01:47:46,501 --> 01:47:48,211
You need anything more?

1967
01:47:48,212 --> 01:47:51,912
Brother, tell me what happens. - I will slap you.

1968
01:47:51,913 --> 01:47:53,093
Brother.

1969
01:47:53,094 --> 01:47:54,363
Do not raise your hand.

1970
01:47:54,364 --> 01:47:56,064
Stay out of this, Gattu!

1971
01:47:56,065 --> 01:47:58,875
Brother, I ... - You think I do not love?

1972
01:47:58,876 --> 01:48:00,876
She is my sister first ...

1973
01:48:00,877 --> 01:48:03,077
... Then your sister.

1974
01:48:03,078 --> 01:48:03,918
Yes brother. - Brother.

1975
01:48:03,929 --> 01:48:07,409
Do what you want, the procession will arrive soon.

1976
01:48:07,410 --> 01:48:09,050
Gattu, what's happening?

1977
01:48:09,051 --> 01:48:11,221
Do not worry, I'm here.

1978
01:48:11,222 --> 01:48:13,222
I'm here.

1979
01:48:15,412 --> 01:48:17,842
Right! I'm heading out. - Yes.

1980
01:48:17,843 --> 01:48:19,843
Go away.

1981
01:48:20,630 --> 01:48:22,570
Gattu. - Binny, I'm going.

1982
01:48:22,571 --> 01:48:24,821
Go away please !

1983
01:48:24,822 --> 01:48:25,762
What is it, Binny?

1984
01:48:25,763 --> 01:48:27,763
There is nothing, there is marriage.

1985
01:48:27,774 --> 01:48:30,274
Put your makeup.

1986
01:48:38,582 --> 01:48:41,462
Do not worry, the police left.

1987
01:48:41,473 --> 01:48:43,373
Marriage can continue.

1988
01:48:43,374 --> 01:48:45,334
Uncle, you do not understand.

1989
01:48:45,335 --> 01:48:47,335
This is part of Dhappi plan.

1990
01:48:47,336 --> 01:48:49,136
The police are in cahoots with him.

1991
01:48:49,137 --> 01:48:52,637
Why did the police come?

1992
01:48:53,919 --> 01:48:55,219
The police ! - Police ?

1993
01:48:55,220 --> 01:48:58,590
I'll be right back. - More ...

1994
01:48:58,591 --> 01:49:00,791
Jaydev.

1995
01:49:04,208 --> 01:49:05,783
Come. - Brother, what are you doing?

1996
01:49:05,784 --> 01:49:07,804
Hush, not a word.

1997
01:49:07,805 --> 01:49:09,005
Brother? - hush!

1998
01:49:09,006 --> 01:49:10,736
What?

1999
01:49:10,737 --> 01:49:12,575
The guests and the police are here.

2000
01:49:12,576 --> 01:49:14,176
The police ? - Yes.

2001
01:49:14,177 --> 01:49:17,707
They threatened to kidnap you. - What say you, brother?

2002
01:49:17,708 --> 01:49:19,709
See, Rahul. - Gattu.

2003
01:49:19,710 --> 01:49:20,710
Gattu.

2004
01:49:20,711 --> 01:49:22,811
Gattu, I do not want problems.

2005
01:49:22,812 --> 01:49:25,012
I want everything to go smoothly.

2006
01:49:25,013 --> 01:49:27,363
I entrust to you the honor of the family.

2007
01:49:27,364 --> 01:49:30,164
Take your sister to a safe place.

2008
01:49:30,165 --> 01:49:33,335
Brother, you must understand that ... - I beg you.

2009
01:49:33,336 --> 01:49:34,786
Please, Binny.

2010
01:49:34,787 --> 01:49:35,967
Listening...

2011
01:49:35,975 --> 01:49:38,625
Do what Gattu says.

2012
01:49:38,626 --> 01:49:41,056
I'll call you as soon as it calms down.

2013
01:49:41,057 --> 01:49:41,657
Go.

2014
01:49:41,658 --> 01:49:44,208
Brother, please, listen to me. - Leave.

2015
01:49:44,209 --> 01:49:46,709
Binny, come with me. - Leave.

2016
01:49:59,010 --> 01:50:04,880
Glory to the gods who always listen.

2017
01:50:04,881 --> 01:50:07,111
The bride will put the mangalsutra.

2018
01:50:07,112 --> 01:50:09,195
Cat, where you m'emmènes?

2019
01:50:09,196 --> 01:50:10,766
Gattu, let me go.

2020
01:50:10,767 --> 01:50:12,497
Gattu, where you taking me? - Follow me.

2021
01:50:12,508 --> 01:50:13,868
Gattu, please.

2022
01:50:13,869 --> 01:50:14,519
Leave me.

2023
01:50:14,520 --> 01:50:16,920
Gattu.

2024
01:50:18,572 --> 01:50:20,732
Mahesh.

2025
01:50:20,733 --> 01:50:22,173
Get up.

2026
01:50:22,174 --> 01:50:24,114
Reverse your fate, go.

2027
01:50:24,115 --> 01:50:26,365
We must reverse your fate.

2028
01:50:26,374 --> 01:50:29,374
What is it ? - Do what I say.

2029
01:50:39,062 --> 01:50:42,842
You get married or you run away you or you are already married?

2030
01:50:42,843 --> 01:50:44,843
Stupid !

2031
01:50:46,142 --> 01:50:49,902
Now, do not swear, it's sometimes true.

2032
01:50:49,903 --> 01:50:52,803
Hold your tongue.

2033
01:50:53,345 --> 01:50:56,145
This marriage be blessed.

2034
01:50:56,146 --> 01:50:59,246
This marriage be blessed.

2035
01:51:16,076 --> 01:51:18,546
Sir, would you like some tea?

2036
01:51:18,547 --> 01:51:20,547
No thanks.

2037
01:51:41,847 --> 01:51:44,247
You're very pretty, Binny.

2038
01:51:44,962 --> 01:51:48,262
Your nose ring ...

2039
01:51:57,570 --> 01:51:58,500
Binny.

2040
01:51:58,501 --> 01:52:04,701
I suppose our presence here surprises you, right?

2041
01:52:05,672 --> 01:52:07,752
Binny, me too, I was surprised.

2042
01:52:07,753 --> 01:52:12,793
When Jadev asked me about your relationship with Bhura.

2043
01:52:13,514 --> 01:52:15,914
Binny, I thought ...

2044
01:52:16,416 --> 01:52:19,716
I thought it was unimportant.

2045
01:52:19,717 --> 01:52:23,517
I never thought the impact ...

2046
01:52:25,219 --> 01:52:28,719
I should have told the truth to your brother.

2047
01:52:30,096 --> 01:52:31,596
Binny, I know ...

2048
01:52:31,597 --> 01:52:34,897
I know I'm not brave.

2049
01:52:35,292 --> 01:52:38,292
But I love you very much, Binny.

2050
01:52:38,972 --> 01:52:41,672
I love you since childhood.

2051
01:52:42,164 --> 01:52:46,144
You see, I managed to bring you here in your wedding dress.

2052
01:52:46,145 --> 01:52:49,545
You have to admit that I have good ideas.

2053
01:52:50,706 --> 01:52:56,506
Perhaps, after all, I can be like you.

2054
01:53:00,057 --> 01:53:04,947
I know you marry anyone except me.

2055
01:53:04,948 --> 01:53:08,508
Even if that's tea seller.

2056
01:53:08,709 --> 01:53:11,709
Okay, not the tea seller.

2057
01:53:15,070 --> 01:53:17,370
Binny, you have to make a decision.

2058
01:53:17,716 --> 01:53:24,116
You have to choose between going to France or stay here.

2059
01:53:25,668 --> 01:53:28,668
Binny, I admit I made mistakes.

2060
01:53:29,119 --> 01:53:33,119
Do not punish me for the rest of my life.

2061
01:53:37,052 --> 01:53:38,637
Take your time, Binny.

2062
01:53:38,638 --> 01:53:41,638
I'm not in a hurry.

2063
01:53:46,912 --> 01:53:47,592
Yes, uncle.

2064
01:53:47,593 --> 01:53:50,813
Did you arrive at the place of marriage? We arrive !

2065
01:53:50,814 --> 01:53:53,494
My bike broke down.

2066
01:53:53,495 --> 01:53:55,575
Your motorcycle is down?

2067
01:53:55,576 --> 01:53:56,556
Where are you ?

2068
01:53:56,557 --> 01:53:58,577
I am at Fountain Park.

2069
01:53:58,578 --> 01:54:01,478
Do not move, it happens.

2070
01:54:03,402 --> 01:54:06,432
You've still for long?

2071
01:54:06,433 --> 01:54:08,433
Take your time.

2072
01:54:10,335 --> 01:54:12,335
Okay.

2073
01:54:15,492 --> 01:54:16,852
The ceremony is perfect.

2074
01:54:16,853 --> 01:54:18,853
The dialed number ...

2075
01:54:27,858 --> 01:54:32,758
The number dialed is unavailable.

2076
01:54:38,632 --> 01:54:43,962
Grandfather, Bhura and daughter are not there. - Where did they go ?

2077
01:54:44,020 --> 01:54:45,070
Uncle.

2078
01:54:45,071 --> 01:54:47,571
This guy says to have seen them.

2079
01:54:48,482 --> 01:54:50,582
One.

2080
01:54:50,583 --> 01:54:53,553
Have you seen a girl in a wedding dress?

2081
01:54:53,554 --> 01:54:56,014
Yes, I saw it.

2082
01:54:56,015 --> 01:54:58,415
Was there someone with her? - Yes, one guy.

2083
01:54:58,416 --> 01:55:00,716
Go away.

2084
01:55:04,534 --> 01:55:07,474
This is a very serious crime.

2085
01:55:07,475 --> 01:55:11,235
They removed my stepdaughter.

2086
01:55:11,236 --> 01:55:13,766
And they removed Gattu too.

2087
01:55:13,827 --> 01:55:16,127
Uncle ... Uncle.

2088
01:55:16,809 --> 01:55:18,279
Uncle, I'm worried.

2089
01:55:18,280 --> 01:55:22,570
The phone Gattu is down. - You think Dhappi ...

2090
01:55:22,571 --> 01:55:25,971
Where is Binny? - She's with Gattu.

2091
01:55:25,972 --> 01:55:27,702
Tirchu Pehelwaan.

2092
01:55:27,703 --> 01:55:29,364
Distributes weapons.

2093
01:55:29,365 --> 01:55:31,665
Here they are.

2094
01:55:31,666 --> 01:55:33,666
Quickly.

2095
01:55:35,948 --> 01:55:38,248
Do not spare anyone.

2096
01:55:40,949 --> 01:55:43,949
Here they are, let us fly!

2097
01:55:51,032 --> 01:55:52,977
Where is Gattu?

2098
01:55:52,978 --> 01:55:54,558
Where is Binny?

2099
01:55:54,559 --> 01:55:59,209
I ask you, where are Binny and Gattu?

2100
01:55:59,222 --> 01:56:01,392
I ask you, where are Gattu and Binny?

2101
01:56:01,393 --> 01:56:03,713
Stop repeating everything.

2102
01:56:03,714 --> 01:56:06,914
I ask you, where are Gattu and Binny?

2103
01:56:07,972 --> 01:56:10,372
Here, Gattu and Binny.

2104
01:56:18,235 --> 01:56:19,955
Bravo, Gattu.

2105
01:56:19,956 --> 01:56:22,526
Bring your sister here.

2106
01:56:22,527 --> 01:56:24,987
No, bring your sister here.

2107
01:56:24,988 --> 01:56:27,149
Bring your sister here Gattu.

2108
01:56:27,150 --> 01:56:28,777
No, bring your sister here.

2109
01:56:28,778 --> 01:56:29,598
Gattu ...

2110
01:56:29,602 --> 01:56:30,982
Bring your sister here.

2111
01:56:30,983 --> 01:56:32,883
Gattu, bring your sister here.

2112
01:56:32,884 --> 01:56:34,201
Binny brought here.

2113
01:56:34,202 --> 01:56:34,942
Bring your ...

2114
01:56:34,943 --> 01:56:37,458
She's not my sister! - What?

2115
01:56:37,519 --> 01:56:40,989
She may be your sister, but not mine.

2116
01:56:40,990 --> 01:56:44,070
Why should I be her brother?

2117
01:56:44,071 --> 01:56:47,051
For years, I had to hide.

2118
01:56:47,052 --> 01:56:51,012
To avoid having a rakhi.

2119
01:56:51,013 --> 01:56:52,863
You remember what you told me?

2120
01:56:52,864 --> 01:56:53,689
You were telling me.

2121
01:56:53,700 --> 01:56:56,570
The neighborhood girls are sisters, not mothers.

2122
01:56:56,571 --> 01:56:58,321
Why ?

2123
01:56:58,322 --> 01:57:02,242
Why take these ancient traditions?

2124
01:57:02,674 --> 01:57:07,134
In case of breakdown of marriage, there is a solution, divorce.

2125
01:57:07,135 --> 01:57:10,715
This link that you impose on us, how to break it?

2126
01:57:10,716 --> 01:57:14,016
Which court should we go?

2127
01:57:14,562 --> 01:57:16,062
Brother...

2128
01:57:16,063 --> 01:57:17,863
I can protect her.

2129
01:57:17,874 --> 01:57:20,974
It is not necessary to be her brother.

2130
01:57:20,975 --> 01:57:23,975
The husband did not he protect his wife?

2131
01:57:23,976 --> 01:57:28,936
Tell me, is he a guy who sees a beautiful girl and says:

2132
01:57:28,938 --> 01:57:30,028
What girl !

2133
01:57:30,029 --> 01:57:31,288
If she was my sister.

2134
01:57:31,289 --> 01:57:32,789
Nobody thinks so.

2135
01:57:32,801 --> 01:57:34,821
You were looking for a husband to your sister.

2136
01:57:34,822 --> 01:57:37,122
Why did you choose a type of France?

2137
01:57:37,123 --> 01:57:40,533
What is wrong with people here?

2138
01:57:40,534 --> 01:57:43,084
It was enough to look in front of you ...

2139
01:57:43,105 --> 01:57:45,305
... To see me.

2140
01:57:47,102 --> 01:57:51,102
You do not have the right to decide who will be my sister.

2141
01:57:51,784 --> 01:57:54,684
I'm tired of being brother.

2142
01:57:55,685 --> 01:57:58,885
It is normal that a man notices a beautiful girl.

2143
01:57:58,886 --> 01:58:01,185
Why did he not? It's normal.

2144
01:58:01,186 --> 01:58:04,186
Do not accept it if it is not well.

2145
01:58:04,187 --> 01:58:07,121
So why this brotherhood?

2146
01:58:07,123 --> 01:58:09,123
Is it not, Binny?

2147
01:58:12,112 --> 01:58:13,182
Binny.

2148
01:58:13,183 --> 01:58:16,183
I want to say loud and clear.

2149
01:58:16,213 --> 01:58:17,613
I love you...

2150
01:58:17,614 --> 01:58:19,814
I love you so much.

2151
01:58:22,025 --> 01:58:26,625
I love you since childhood and I always will.

2152
01:58:27,002 --> 01:58:30,502
I do not want to be your brother.

2153
01:58:34,903 --> 01:58:37,093
What do you say of courage?

2154
01:58:37,114 --> 01:58:40,714
This is what I expect from you, silly.

2155
01:58:41,902 --> 01:58:43,902
I love you.

2156
01:58:44,802 --> 01:58:47,702
Stop !

2157
01:58:47,703 --> 01:58:51,303
Nobody move or I'll shoot!

2158
01:58:54,242 --> 01:58:56,662
Hé, Gattu ...

2159
01:58:56,663 --> 01:58:58,313
I want to tell you...

2160
01:58:58,314 --> 01:59:01,574
... what you said touched me.

2161
01:59:02,833 --> 01:59:04,833
Give me your hand.

2162
01:59:08,702 --> 01:59:11,702
Marry her. - Thanks, Rahul.

2163
01:59:14,582 --> 01:59:16,132
Kill him.

2164
01:59:16,133 --> 01:59:18,833
Fuyons !

2165
01:59:28,594 --> 01:59:30,824
The men stopped hiding.

2166
01:59:30,845 --> 01:59:34,675
If someone wants to make a girl your sister.

2167
01:59:34,676 --> 01:59:36,710
Tell him...

2168
01:59:36,711 --> 01:59:38,351
What are you saying ?

2169
01:59:38,352 --> 01:59:40,752
Make it your sister.

2170
01:59:46,296 --> 01:59:51,096
This is a remixed version of Rishi Rich.

2171
02:00:02,955 --> 02:00:04,680
Rishi rich !

2172
02:00:04,681 --> 02:00:06,661
Juggy D !

2173
02:00:06,662 --> 02:00:09,112
raftaar lyric poet!

2174
02:00:09,113 --> 02:00:15,963
My darling, my love, I am ready to sacrifice everything for you.

2175
02:00:15,964 --> 02:00:22,964
My darling, my love, I am ready to sacrifice everything for you.

2176
02:00:22,965 --> 02:00:30,265
Tu es mien.

2177
02:00:37,015 --> 02:00:44,025
We are made for each other, the whole nation knows.

2178
02:00:44,026 --> 02:00:50,506
We are made for each other, the whole nation knows.

2179
02:00:50,527 --> 02:00:54,527
I am a simple man and I want to be part of your family.

2180
02:00:54,528 --> 02:00:57,761
I love your sister, do not put yourself in the way of that.

2181
02:00:57,762 --> 02:01:01,062
I love your sister and I want to marry her.

2182
02:01:01,063 --> 02:01:04,413
I will preserve the honor of your family.

2183
02:01:04,414 --> 02:01:08,044
I will do everything for it lacks nothing.

2184
02:01:08,045 --> 02:01:11,945
I love your sister, I want to make my wife.

2185
02:01:11,946 --> 02:01:14,946
Your husband is right, sister.

2186
02:01:15,456 --> 02:01:22,339
Do not look with your eyes, look with your heart.

2187
02:01:22,341 --> 02:01:29,386
Why look elsewhere when you have a woman like you?

Our childhood friendship became a love story.
