1
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:22,770
Very good!
This is your next program.

2
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:27,770
News flash! Murder in a train
just ahead of Igatpuri!

3
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:32,640
News flash! Murder in a train
just ahead of Igatpuri!

4
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,790
Come, come!
How may I serve you?

5
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,640
Look, do you have
any unique gems?

6
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,760
Something very special?
- Yes, I do. I do.

7
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:52,690
I want to present it
to my wife as a gift.

8
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:55,300
Sir, I have a very unique gem.

9
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:57,840
Just what you are looking for.
Let me show you.

10
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,490
Look at this.

11
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:05,180
Look at this.

12
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:10,460
Very good.

13
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,420
How much will it be worth?

14
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,020
Only a hundred
thousand rupees.

15
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:17,390
Ring it up!
- As you wish.

16
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:32,460
Hello! Yes, this is
Hiralal Jewellers.

17
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,440
The Prince?

18
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:36,600
Yes, he's here.

19
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,260
I'll call him, Princess.

20
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,070
It's a call for you, Prince.

21
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:47,000
Hello! Oh, hello darling!

22
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:50,450
Darling, I've purchased
a very beautiful..

23
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:52,050
...and unique gem for you.

24
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,400
Yes.

25
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:55,310
What's that you say?

26
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:58,170
American car?
Hundred thousand rupees?

27
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:00,320
Not a problem.
I'll give you cheque for..

28
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:01,750
...a hundred thousand
once I get home.

29
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,600
What? He's asking for cash?

30
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,900
The car dealer is
asking for cash?

31
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,050
Why is he is insisting?
He can take a cheque.

32
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:12,120
Cash! Look, darling!

33
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:14,480
I'm giving all
my cash to the jeweller.

34
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:18,860
Also today is Saturday
and the banks are closed.

35
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:21,410
Alright. I'll purchase the
gem the day after tomorrow.

36
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:22,730
As you wish.

37
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,250
Women are amazing! Sir!

38
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:30,730
Sir, sir! Why the day after
tomorrow? Take it today.

39
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:32,820
Why should you delay
an auspicious activity?

40
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:35,360
What's the difference between
your cheque and cash?

41
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:37,440
As you wish!

42
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,150
God bless! Here, take this.

43
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,700
Sir, do visit us again.

44
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:52,370
Treat this shop as your own.

45
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:55,150
If I get customers like you,
I will be blessed, Sir.

46
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:58,000
God bless! God bless!

47
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:17,250
As soon as he left,
the cheque has disappeared.

48
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:19,340
Oh no! I'm robbed!
I'm ruined! I'm ruined!

49
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:22,080
Guard! Guard, stop that car!

50
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:23,510
I'm ruined! I'm ruined!

51
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:24,730
Did that guy with
the car run away?

52
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:27,090
I'm ruined! Someone catch him!

53
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,910
Do you have his number?
- Yes.

54
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,150
Come on!

55
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:37,190
Police! Police!
- Yes.

56
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:39,270
I am Hiralal Jeweller speaking.

57
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,350
Bring that cheque
personally right away.

58
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:47,060
What? Don't worry.

59
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,260
Police will definitely
find those crooks.

60
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,140
What did you say
was the car number?

61
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:55,620
MRD

62
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:59,620
5619

63
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:39,910
<i>As soon as I saw
your beautiful eyes..</i>

64
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:44,260
<i>...my heart got influenced.</i>

65
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:48,610
<i>Please take care of me,
my friends.</i>

66
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:52,720
<i>It's become difficult to
take care of myself.</i>

67
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:16,550
<i>My heart is filled
with dreams of you.</i>

68
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:21,460
<i>Just like pictures
on a wall.</i>

69
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:25,070
<i>Why have I fallen for you?</i>

70
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,770
<i>I am angry on love for it.</i>

71
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:32,340
<i>I am robbed.</i>

72
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,570
<i>My heart isn't
mine anymore.</i>

73
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,720
<i>I am ruined.</i>

74
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:39,340
<i>What can I
tell you, beloved?</i>

75
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:43,610
<i>The magic of your
eyes is evil.</i>

76
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,760
<i>He is my culprit.</i>

77
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:52,350
<i>As soon as I saw
your beautiful eyes..</i>

78
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:56,460
<i>...my heart got influenced.</i>

79
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:26,790
<i>I have always wanted to save
myself from beautiful women.</i>

80
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:29,090
<i>I swear on you.</i>

81
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,220
<i>I live in dreams.</i>

82
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:35,590
<i>I tried to save myself
from beautiful girls.</i>

83
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:42,700
<i>But gosh! Our eyes met and
I got the heartache.</i>

84
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:45,130
<i>Listen to me, beloved.</i>

85
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:53,720
<i>When you smiled and looked at
me, I was in love with you.</i>

86
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:58,390
<i>As soon as I saw
your beautiful eyes,</i>

87
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:02,280
<i>...my heart got influenced.</i>

88
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,660
<i>Please take care of me,
my friends.</i>

89
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:12,170
<i>Its become difficult to
take care of myself.</i>

90
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:23,360
Is this your car?
- Yes. What's the matter?

91
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,150
You'll have to come to
the police station with us.

92
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:27,780
Why? - You'll know
when we get there.

93
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,010
Nita, go home.

94
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:35,920
I need to go with them.
- No!

95
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:38,220
I won't let you go
with these cops.

96
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:41,660
Silly! The cops are here
to serve the people.

97
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,880
Not to harass them.

98
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:44,840
There must be some
misunderstanding.

99
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:47,020
If I go with them, I can
cure the misunderstanding.

100
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:48,620
Taxi!

101
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,020
Go on! I'll meet you
here again tomorrow.

102
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,200
Same time. Ok?

103
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,190
Come on.

104
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:11,420
Sir. Sorry, we made a mistake.

105
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,710
No problem. You can
follow me in the jeep.

106
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,990
I'll drive the car.

107
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:28,220
First they show him currency
worth 150 thousand rupees.

108
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,560
So that the shop keeper
doesn't doubt them.

109
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:34,870
Then they give
him this cheque.

110
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:39,110
It's from someone's stolen
cheque two months ago.

111
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:41,890
Even the ink on this
cheque disappears.

112
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:45,200
The getaway car has...

113
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:48,050
...CID officer,
Shyam's number on it.

114
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,680
The entire con is pulled off in
such a way that you can't get..

115
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:56,220
...any clues from
their actions.

116
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:59,980
Sir, maybe we will get some
clues if we send the cheque..

117
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:02,940
...to the chemical analyser.

118
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:08,750
Hello! - Yes.

119
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:10,910
Can I speak to
Inspector Shyam?

120
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,070
I'm his relative.

121
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,430
Shyam, it's a call for you.

122
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:17,790
It's your relative.
- Relative?

123
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:21,030
Hello! Who's speaking?

124
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:26,800
I'm the one who used
the number off your car.

125
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:30,140
I wanted to thank you for it.

126
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:32,800
Maybe you don't know..

127
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:35,230
...the consequences of pulling
such a prank on the police.

128
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,180
Inspector Shyam,
this is not a joke.

129
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:41,420
This is just a small
demonstration..

130
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,510
...for your department and you.

131
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:49,360
To tell you not to come
in our way the next time.

132
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:52,590
Else, I'll give you
more demonstrations..

133
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,990
...that will make
you blink in awe.

134
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,870
Brilliant! Excellent!

135
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:58,330
But who will blink...

136
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:03,340
Hello?

137
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:04,590
Hello?

138
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,050
Hello?

139
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,400
Sir, this call was
made from a public..

140
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:10,780
...telephone booth in Juhu.

141
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:12,770
How can these crooks
dare to do that!

142
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:15,510
They are openly
threatening the police.

143
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:16,940
Inspector Shyam.

144
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:19,230
I'm handing over
this case to you.

145
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:21,950
It's imperative to
arrest these crooks.

146
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:24,630
It's a matter of reputation
for the police department.

147
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,960
The department's reputation
is my reputation.

148
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:32,630
Sorry, Inspector.

149
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,390
We can't find out anything
about the ink which..

150
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:36,950
...disappeared
from this cheque.

151
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,010
Keep this in the records. - Ok.

152
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,540
Thank you.

153
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:59,630
Shyam! Shyam! I was waiting
for you for so long!

154
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,840
Sorry, Nita. I got delayed.

155
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,800
What happened yesterday?
- Why did they take you?

156
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:08,810
They should take me daily.

157
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,500
At least you'll hug me.

158
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:15,610
I'm worried about you and
you're worried about hugging.

159
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:19,850
Remember, someday
a cop will take you too.

160
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:22,210
What's the matter? -What?

161
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:25,870
What's the matter?
- The matter is...

162
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,720
The matter, it's a secret!
Come here.

163
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:30,040
Come! I'll tell you.

164
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:33,410
Sit.

165
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:35,750
What kind of secret is it?

166
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,550
Should I tell you? - Yes.

167
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,680
The man that you love..

168
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:43,540
...he's a cop.

169
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:49,520
You mean, you are... - Yes.

170
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:51,750
You lied to me..

171
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:53,180
...that you're an art student.

172
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:54,560
It was true.

173
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,000
I love you.

174
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,020
Love is an art too.

175
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:01,770
Liar! - But, but...

176
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,070
No matter what,
I am all yours.

177
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,050
Don't get angry.

178
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:09,260
Give me a smile. - Let me go!

179
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:10,530
Give me a smile first.

180
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:12,590
I'm scared of you.

181
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:14,300
Don't be scared.

182
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:16,690
The cops are here
to serve the public.

183
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:19,000
Not to scare the public.

184
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:21,850
Come near. - No! - Come near.

185
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:24,350
No! - Come near.

186
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,070
Let me go!

187
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:35,720
Come! - Come!

188
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:47,130
Bye! - Bye!

189
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,560
Inspector Shyam!

190
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:03,490
Don't dare to cross
paths with us.

191
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:06,420
Else, I'll give you
demonstrations..

192
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:08,990
...which will make
you blink in awe.

193
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,830
Amazing! Excellent!

194
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:12,150
But who will blink...

195
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,330
...make you blink in awe.

196
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:21,830
Amazing! Excellent!

197
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:23,250
But who will blink...

198
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,690
<i>Darling, I said..</i>

199
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,440
<i>You heard me.</i>

200
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:32,150
<i>My darling, I said..</i>

201
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,900
<i>You heard me, beloved.</i>

202
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:38,340
<i>You heard what
my heart said to yours.</i>

203
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:43,430
<i>Darling, I said..</i>

204
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:46,040
<i>You heard me.</i>

205
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:48,790
<i>My darling, I said..</i>

206
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:51,470
<i>You heard me, beloved.</i>

207
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:55,290
<i>You heard what
my heart said to yours.</i>

208
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:26,700
<i>I make miracles during
a conversation.</i>

209
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:37,070
<i>I reside in your
heart like a dream.</i>

210
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:45,950
<i>I reply to you
through my eyes.</i>

211
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:56,420
<i>I question you
through my eyes.</i>

212
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:00,250
<i>Darling, I said..</i>

213
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:02,610
<i>You heard me.</i>

214
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:05,500
<i>Darling, I said..</i>

215
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,970
<i>You heard me.</i>

216
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:12,080
<i>You heard what my heart
said to yours.</i>

217
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:43,180
<i>I am a bit anxious for you.</i>

218
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:53,330
<i>You look a bit anxious too.</i>

219
00:20:54,760 --> 00:21:01,940
<i>Our conditions are similar.</i>

220
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:12,660
<i>Why don't we both
fall in love?</i>

221
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:16,260
<i>Darling, I said..</i>

222
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:18,780
<i>You heard me.</i>

223
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:21,660
<i>Darling, I said..</i>

224
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:23,950
<i>You heard me.</i>

225
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:27,990
<i>You heard what my heart
said to yours.</i>

226
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:57,290
<i>Romantic conversations in
this beautiful evening.</i>

227
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:07,720
<i>We don't get these evening
again in our youth.</i>

228
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:15,930
<i>There's a talk of
love on my lips.</i>

229
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:26,450
<i>Your lips have the
story of our love.</i>

230
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:29,920
<i>Darling, I said..</i>

231
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:32,810
<i>You heard me.</i>

232
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:35,530
<i>My darling, I said..</i>

233
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:37,810
<i>You heard me, beloved.</i>

234
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:41,120
<i>You heard what my heart
said to yours.</i>

235
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,060
<i>Darling, I said..</i>

236
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:48,640
<i>You heard me.</i>

237
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:51,180
<i>My darling, I said..</i>

238
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,650
<i>You heard me, beloved.</i>

239
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:57,760
<i>You heard what my heart
said to yours.</i>

240
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:07,840
Hi handsome!

241
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,760
Did you recognise me?

242
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:13,100
In the entire country,
there is just woman..

243
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:15,360
...who calls me handsome.

244
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:17,410
Miss Lily.

245
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:20,550
Thank you.

246
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:25,130
Yes.

247
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:26,980
The one who loved you but..

248
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:30,670
...whom you always
stayed away from.

249
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,370
It's not that.

250
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:35,640
During college, I concentrated
on my studies completely.

251
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:37,620
But now...

252
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:40,030
What now?

253
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:48,620
What's the matter? - Nothing.

254
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:50,710
We've met after ages.

255
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,870
I want to talk to you about
a lot of things, Shyam.

256
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:55,370
But not here.

257
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:58,190
I feel claustrophobic
with this crowd.

258
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:01,670
Women always speak in tongues.

259
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:06,430
I want to ask you
a lot of things. Ok?

260
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,520
Let's go.

261
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:11,620
Number one speaking.

262
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,600
CID inspector Shyam has
followed us here.

263
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:19,620
I've put Lily to follow him
and take care of him.

264
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:23,870
Very good.
Lily does her job well.

265
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:25,920
But you must be careful.

266
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:29,260
The enemy is very smart and
a handsome young man.

267
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:31,350
Yes, boss. Anything else?

268
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,440
Is the plans for
the evening ready?

269
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:34,820
Yes, boss.

270
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,060
How long have you been here?

271
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:40,840
I've been here a few months.

272
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:42,230
You've changed a lot.

273
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:45,020
I didn't recognise you.
- Really?

274
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,380
I don't understand.

275
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,260
Where did you
disappear once the..

276
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:51,460
...college education got over.

277
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:54,520
You knew about my father.

278
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:57,480
You know what a gambler
and alcoholic father..

279
00:24:57,540 --> 00:25:01,440
...leaves for his daughter.

280
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:03,980
A mountain of debts.

281
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:07,040
That happened with me too.

282
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:11,390
I was left helpless
in this world.

283
00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:15,420
What happened next?
- Don't ask what happened next.

284
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:17,160
For next two or three years..

285
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:20,750
...there was darkness
in my life.

286
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:24,610
Then someone rescued me
from that darkness.

287
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:26,350
And I...

288
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:27,950
You know..

289
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:30,800
...I used to love dancing.

290
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:34,840
I thought of making
that my livelihood.

291
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:38,070
You must be making good money.

292
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:42,010
Shyam, I earn enough
to live well.

293
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:43,500
You must have your own car.

294
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:45,450
You loved cars from
the beginning.

295
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:47,230
I am so silly!

296
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:48,800
I kept talking about myself.

297
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,760
I never even asked you how
you spent so many years.

298
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,080
After passing the BA exams..

299
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:55,370
...I went to Bombay
looking for a job.

300
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:57,770
I'm a medical representative.

301
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,340
I sell medicines.
- Did you get married?

302
00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:03,480
Nothing for me.
I'm patient of loneliness.

303
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:07,720
Maybe two patients
can get together..

304
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:10,440
...and cure each other.

305
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:19,690
Why do you look scared?
- Not at all!

306
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:24,450
Shyam, excuse me.
I'll be back.

307
00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:26,990
Ok?

308
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:15,480
A second threat within
twenty four hours.

309
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:19,890
I believe those
crooks needed Lily.

310
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:22,220
Mr. Kapoor, I have a hunch..

311
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:24,240
...that there will some
event in the evening.

312
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:28,310
If we arrest Lily we will
get to know all the crooks.

313
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:30,570
We don't have any
evidence against Lily.

314
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:35,200
But I believe we can catch
this gang only with Lily's help.

315
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:39,450
Hello? Speaking.

316
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:42,400
What did you say?
Just ahead of Kalyan.

317
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:45,050
Boxes were thrown out
of a running train.

318
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:46,750
What was in those boxes?

319
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:48,940
Silver.

320
00:28:50,050 --> 00:28:51,170
What was the car's number?

321
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:53,530
Ok.

322
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,640
Sorry, Mr. Shyam.

323
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:03,630
The car number
that you've given us..

324
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:05,680
...is not registered with us.

325
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,830
I see.

326
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:09,230
Anyway, thank you.
- Ok, sir.

327
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:17,020
Good morning!
- Good morning!

328
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:19,110
Is Ms. Lily the cabaret
dancer in this hotel?

329
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:21,580
She's not here at the moment.
- And her home address?

330
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:23,250
I'll just look in.

331
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:54,380
When are you throwing a party?

332
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:56,440
You should be giving
us a party. - Why?

333
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,710
Because you have
passed this year.

334
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:49,180
What?

335
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:52,830
Hey!

336
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:55,030
Nita? - Yes.

337
00:30:55,890 --> 00:30:57,290
Is this a dream or reality?

338
00:30:58,050 --> 00:30:59,200
A dream.

339
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:05,770
A dream that will become
a reality very soon.

340
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:08,840
Shyam.

341
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:12,640
I will talk to your
mother in the evening..

342
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:14,340
...when I visit your home.

343
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:17,160
No, Shyam. Not now.

344
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:22,580
Nita, you always avoid the
conversation about marriage.

345
00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:25,820
No, Shyam. It's not that.

346
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:28,220
Why don't you try
to understand?

347
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:30,070
I have some responsibilities.

348
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,530
Once they're complete, then...

349
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:37,260
Give me your responsibilities.

350
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:50,870
Bye!

351
00:31:56,570 --> 00:31:58,660
Hi handsome! - Lily?!

352
00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:01,340
You and here? How did you
get my home address?

353
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:02,940
If one has determination..

354
00:32:03,010 --> 00:32:05,380
...people can find the secrets
to the moon and stars.

355
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:08,340
Can't I find the
address to your home.

356
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,320
Why did you take the
trouble to come so far?

357
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:12,480
To know the status of my fate.

358
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:14,780
I came to ask..

359
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:17,410
...you whether what you
asked me last night..

360
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,330
...was a joke?

361
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:21,600
Shyam never jokes about
such matters, Lily.

362
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:26,670
Then why did you disappear
by leaving me alone.

363
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,420
Where were you when I returned
from the cloak room?

364
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,260
That's what I wanted to
know from you, Lily.

365
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:33,970
Where was I last evening?
When I was waiting for you..

366
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,480
...some men attacked me.

367
00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:38,090
Some heavy object hit me
in the head and...

368
00:32:38,150 --> 00:32:39,890
I was unconscious.
- Unconscious?!

369
00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:41,520
Yes, unconscious.

370
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:44,380
When I came around,
I was lying somewhere else.

371
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:46,950
Did you get hurt a lot?
- Not much.

372
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:50,710
You get hurt in love.

373
00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:52,870
Who did this to you?

374
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:54,430
I know.

375
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:56,900
Who?

376
00:32:57,210 --> 00:32:58,400
Some enemy.

377
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:01,010
Which enemy?

378
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:03,140
Can you tell me?

379
00:33:04,410 --> 00:33:06,640
What do you mean?
- This was definitely..

380
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:09,110
...the work of one
of your admirers.

381
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:15,700
There is only name in
my list of lovers.

382
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:19,860
Yours! - And those
who love you?

383
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:21,330
How do I know?

384
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:26,200
Shyam, you should always
take care of yourself.

385
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,550
Don't worry.

386
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,270
What are you doing
this evening?

387
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:32,670
The same job.

388
00:33:33,290 --> 00:33:34,620
I'll meet you at the hotel.

389
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,680
Right now, I need to go for
some urgent work. I will...

390
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:42,100
Is there some work
more important than me?

391
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:46,900
No. But I need to work.

392
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:07,400
<i>Why did I fall in love?</i>

393
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:11,710
<i>Why did I make
myself anxious?</i>

394
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:16,370
<i>I wait for you every
evening and morning.</i>

395
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:20,610
<i>Day and night
I wait for you.</i>

396
00:34:21,370 --> 00:34:24,790
<i>Why did I fall in love?</i>

397
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:29,040
<i>Why did I make
myself anxious?</i>

398
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:33,770
<i>I wait for you every
evening and morning.</i>

399
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:37,970
<i>Day and night
I wait for you.</i>

400
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:42,610
<i>Why did I fall in love?</i>

401
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:04,480
<i>I have applied kohl
in my eyes.</i>

402
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:08,000
<i>I have put a dot
on my forehead.</i>

403
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:16,310
<i>If you come now,
I won't worry.</i>

404
00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:25,250
<i>Quietly, my desires have
awakened in my heart.</i>

405
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:33,780
<i>If someone sees me this way,
I will be ruined.</i>

406
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:38,620
<i>Why did I groom myself?</i>

407
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:42,860
<i>Why did I make
myself anxious?</i>

408
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:47,350
<i>I wait for you every
evening and morning.</i>

409
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,250
<i>Day and night
I wait for you.</i>

410
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:55,700
<i>Why did I fall in love?</i>

411
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:20,290
<i>Today's the day,
for which I have..</i>

412
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:23,850
<i>...tortured myself like
Goddess Radha.</i>

413
00:36:24,610 --> 00:36:32,920
<i>Today my heart has become
even more restless.</i>

414
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:37,380
<i>I don't want to be
deceived in love.</i>

415
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:40,970
<i>That's cause
my heart is simple.</i>

416
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:49,660
<i>May he not lie to me
about our union today.</i>

417
00:36:50,590 --> 00:36:54,250
<i>Why did I confess?</i>

418
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:58,700
<i>Why did I make
myself restless?</i>

419
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:03,030
<i>I wait for you every
evening and morning.</i>

420
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:07,710
<i>Day and night
I wait for you.</i>

421
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:12,480
<i>Why did I fall in love?</i>

422
00:37:25,490 --> 00:37:27,380
You've bloomed like
a bud ever since..

423
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:29,540
...you've passed your
exam, my dear.

424
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,470
Take some offerings, dear.

425
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,590
May God fulfil
all your wishes.

426
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:43,580
May your father return soon.

427
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:52,220
You've decorated
the home as if...

428
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:54,370
Someone's going to come, mum.

429
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:57,570
Who is it, dear?

430
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:00,290
Ever since your father left..

431
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:02,410
...no one comes here.

432
00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:03,900
He is..

433
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:07,150
...a police officer. - Police!

434
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:09,610
What more does the
police want from us?

435
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,890
Nothing, mother. He is coming
to take your permission.

436
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:18,720
He wants to marry your
daughter. - You mean..

437
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:22,700
Yes, mother.
Few months ago we met.

438
00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:25,060
And then we kept
on meeting everyday.

439
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:29,140
If you meet him then you'll
also like him, mother.

440
00:38:29,470 --> 00:38:33,380
I hope you've told him who
your father is? - No, mother.

441
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:38,460
I had thought that I'll pass
B.A degree and take up a job.

442
00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:43,400
We'll save some money and
appeal in the Supreme Court.

443
00:38:43,770 --> 00:38:45,860
So that we can get father
released from the prison.

444
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:47,920
And then I'll get married.

445
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,250
But he has left
with no choice.

446
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,340
He said that from
henceforth all..

447
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,950
...your responsibilities
are mine.

448
00:38:56,790 --> 00:38:59,430
Today when he comes,
I'll tell him everything.

449
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:05,560
The dreams which you have
dreamt, forget them. - But why?

450
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:08,730
Will a police officer marry
a murderer's daughter?

451
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:11,820
But father is innocent.
He has been framed.

452
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:17,390
We know that he is innocent.
But who believes us?

453
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:19,230
The police say that
he is the criminal.

454
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:21,210
The Law says that
he is the criminal.

455
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:26,960
Mother, he has arrived.
He'll definitely help us.

456
00:39:35,130 --> 00:39:37,680
Father! - Don't raise your
voice. Shut the door.

457
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,890
You have come back.
They have released you?

458
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,120
They have not released me.
I've left them and come.

459
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:43,860
I've escaped from the prison.

460
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:45,840
Why are you both
just gaping at me?

461
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:48,880
Before the police arrive,
we'll go away somewhere far.

462
00:39:49,010 --> 00:39:50,300
Kamala, get my clothes.

463
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:52,910
I want to get rid of these
prison clothes instantly.

464
00:39:55,130 --> 00:39:56,250
Mother..

465
00:40:09,570 --> 00:40:11,310
Hello! Police station?

466
00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:14,100
But where will we run away
from the law? - Anywhere!

467
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,390
I've told you once.
- Father, I am scared..

468
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:19,570
Now what do you want? You want
me to go back to that hell?!

469
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:26,860
God! I am fed up of this life.

470
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:31,120
Father! - What are you doing?!
- Father..

471
00:40:31,450 --> 00:40:33,830
It is better to die than
go back to the prison.

472
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:36,330
Then thrust this dagger
in my chest. - Mother!

473
00:40:36,850 --> 00:40:39,810
Father, whatever you
wish will happen.

474
00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:43,290
We are ready to
do whatever you say.

475
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:48,260
Okay. Then come with me. Come!

476
00:40:51,530 --> 00:40:53,520
Stop! - Who are you?!

477
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:56,680
Mother, he's the one.

478
00:40:57,690 --> 00:40:59,250
He has come to take
your blessings.

479
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:01,970
He wants you to give him your
daughter's hand in marriage.

480
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:03,220
That will also happen.

481
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:05,980
But first you give
your hand in my hand.

482
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:08,960
What do you mean? - You are
an escaped convict..

483
00:41:09,450 --> 00:41:11,010
...and I am a police officer.

484
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:15,500
Shyam!

485
00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:19,400
To hide one crime, you want
to commit another crime?

486
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:21,940
My father is innocent, Shyam.

487
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:24,240
The wrongs which the world
has done to him..

488
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:26,920
...has made him to
lose his senses.

489
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:28,340
I'll not go back to
the prison.

490
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:31,430
I'll hit my head on
the wall and die here.

491
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:35,400
You please stand quietly..

492
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:38,330
...till the police come.
- Shyam..

493
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:40,490
Shyam, don't be too ruthless.

494
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:44,760
God forbid if father has to
go back to prison then..

495
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:49,810
On behalf of my other
I beg of you.

496
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:54,270
Nita, would you like
a dishonest man for a husband?

497
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:59,450
Shyam, please save my father.
Please save my father.

498
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:01,610
Otherwise our family
will be destroyed.

499
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:04,310
We'll not be able
to take this blow.

500
00:42:04,870 --> 00:42:09,120
I swear by your love that
my father is innocent.

501
00:42:09,570 --> 00:42:11,730
I too swear by
your love, Nita..

502
00:42:12,310 --> 00:42:15,350
...if he is innocent then I'll
try my level best to save him.

503
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:17,400
I do not believe
the police anymore.

504
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:20,180
Earlier too the police had
said that he's innocent..

505
00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:21,540
...and that
he would be released.

506
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:23,530
But what happened?
What did I get?

507
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,350
Hardships in the prison and
working in the hot sun..

508
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:28,780
...breaking stones.
I got blisters in my hands.

509
00:42:29,330 --> 00:42:31,880
Your Law is blind.
It is cruel.

510
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:35,080
The Law is made to protect
the truth and human beings.

511
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:37,370
But sometimes even
it can also make a mistake.

512
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:39,840
Because the scales of Law
are in the hands of us humans.

513
00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:43,210
I.. I'll investigate
this case deeply..

514
00:42:44,010 --> 00:42:45,300
...and find out the truth.

515
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,360
By the time you finish
your investigation..

516
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:48,710
...we'll be destroyed, Shyam.

517
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:50,110
Nita..

518
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:52,680
...the way I can't deceive
my love in the same manner..

519
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:55,570
...I can not shirk
from my duty.

520
00:42:55,770 --> 00:42:58,560
I am fed up hearing
about Law and duty.

521
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:01,100
But have you ever thought
about the one who has..

522
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,710
...completely surrendered
herself to you..

523
00:43:03,950 --> 00:43:06,010
...you have some duty
towards her too?

524
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:11,360
Didn't you say that all
my responsibilities are yours?

525
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:16,380
Thinking of that only
I am doing all this.

526
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:22,840
Father!

527
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:28,370
Father.. - Kamala.. Daughter..

528
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:30,320
Father..

529
00:43:31,010 --> 00:43:32,450
Mother!

530
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:37,350
How many times?

531
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:39,990
Nita..

532
00:43:40,930 --> 00:43:42,040
I'll come some other time.

533
00:43:42,290 --> 00:43:45,450
You dare not come back here.
- Get out of here.

534
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:48,140
Nita.. - I do not want
to hear anything!

535
00:43:48,790 --> 00:43:53,320
I didn't know I was in love
with a stone and not a human.

536
00:43:53,870 --> 00:43:56,940
You get out of here
and never come back.

537
00:44:02,470 --> 00:44:05,740
Sir, this is the copy of
the courts ruling. - Thank you.

538
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:11,690
Ramdev Vs The State
of Maharashtra.

539
00:44:14,570 --> 00:44:16,800
According to
the eye witnesses..

540
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:20,040
...on hearing
Ramdev's screams..

541
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:23,320
...and the other employees..

542
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:25,610
...of the firm ran towards
Shyamlal Mehta's room.

543
00:44:26,470 --> 00:44:29,600
On entering the room they saw
that the safe was open and..

544
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:32,530
...lot of currency notes were
scattered all over the floor.

545
00:44:32,730 --> 00:44:36,780
Shyamlal Mehta was lying down
dead on the floor near them.

546
00:44:37,990 --> 00:44:39,210
At a little distance
Ramdev was standing..

547
00:44:39,270 --> 00:44:41,830
...screaming with the dagger
in his right hand.

548
00:44:42,130 --> 00:44:43,840
Murder! Murder! Murder!

549
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:49,720
Ramdev's both hands and the
dagger were smeared in blood.

550
00:44:50,790 --> 00:44:55,220
It is obvious that with
the intension of stealing..

551
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:57,690
...the money,
Ramdev murdered Shyamlal.

552
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:23,670
Shyam..

553
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:27,570
...you are very tense today.

554
00:45:28,990 --> 00:45:30,700
That's why I've come to you.

555
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:34,360
I wish it was the truth.

556
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:37,110
It is the truth Lily.

557
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:40,660
I find peace coming near you.

558
00:45:41,620 --> 00:45:42,740
Really?!

559
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:45,880
Its not your fault.

560
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:48,800
Men are like that.

561
00:45:48,890 --> 00:45:50,040
Lily...

562
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:53,290
Women are a beautiful
mystery that men make the..

563
00:45:53,350 --> 00:45:55,340
...same mistakes
over and over. But..

564
00:45:55,990 --> 00:45:57,320
...yet he doesn't understand.

565
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:02,990
I'll explain this riddle.

566
00:46:04,170 --> 00:46:05,320
Promise?

567
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:07,380
First make the mistake.

568
00:46:13,870 --> 00:46:15,020
Lily...

569
00:46:15,820 --> 00:46:20,250
To understand you, I'll make
a hundred mistakes.

570
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:23,650
But I don't drink.

571
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:25,360
Why?

572
00:46:26,230 --> 00:46:28,490
The intoxication from life is
sufficient enough for me.

573
00:46:41,810 --> 00:46:43,000
Darling..

574
00:46:44,390 --> 00:46:46,200
...my clothes are left there.

575
00:46:46,510 --> 00:46:48,360
And I can't come out now.

576
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:50,090
Please give it to me.

577
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:09,440
Shyam..

578
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:13,620
...you sell medicines
across the world.

579
00:47:14,270 --> 00:47:17,030
But you can't cure
your own illness.

580
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:20,680
I can tell you the
cure for your illness.

581
00:47:22,310 --> 00:47:24,130
Because I know
how to value love.

582
00:47:32,470 --> 00:47:34,770
What happened?!
- Nothing.

583
00:47:35,150 --> 00:47:36,260
No, tell me!

584
00:47:36,850 --> 00:47:38,670
Lily, when time comes
I'll tell you everything.

585
00:47:39,390 --> 00:47:41,590
Okay. I'll wait.

586
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:45,560
But once a woman decides
about something then..

587
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:48,790
...she anyhow gets it.

588
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:55,360
B.A. 1st division.
Good! Good qualification.

589
00:47:55,990 --> 00:47:57,980
What's your father's name?
- Ramdev.

590
00:47:58,700 --> 00:47:59,820
What does he do?

591
00:48:01,450 --> 00:48:02,570
What's the matter?

592
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:09,460
He.. He is in the prison.
- In prison?!

593
00:48:09,730 --> 00:48:12,410
He was framed and sentenced
in a murder case.

594
00:48:12,930 --> 00:48:14,080
I'm sorry..

595
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:17,950
The firm will be defamed.

596
00:48:18,250 --> 00:48:19,370
Next!

597
00:48:27,610 --> 00:48:28,730
Nita!

598
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:34,790
Nita! - I am not your Nita.

599
00:48:35,270 --> 00:48:37,500
What's wrong with you?!
- Do not harass me.

600
00:48:38,610 --> 00:48:41,090
At least listen to me.
- Do not follow me, or I'll..

601
00:48:41,150 --> 00:48:43,590
Nita, I know that in your
eyes I am a very bad man.

602
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,710
But I've not done
anything bad.

603
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:47,550
If you've not done
anything bad..

604
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:49,500
...then why are
you make excuses?

605
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:51,690
Nita, I want to
tell you something.

606
00:48:52,250 --> 00:48:55,070
About you.. About your father.

607
00:48:55,310 --> 00:48:58,900
Let us be. Already you've
done enough for us.

608
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,960
Whatever I've done, it's for
your father's advantage.

609
00:49:02,090 --> 00:49:03,630
It was my duty.

610
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:06,800
Then do your duty
and forget me.

611
00:49:06,930 --> 00:49:08,040
Nita..

612
00:49:09,190 --> 00:49:11,000
...you are saying this?
- Yes!

613
00:49:11,730 --> 00:49:14,170
Think that I never
met you in life.

614
00:49:15,070 --> 00:49:16,330
You've simply said it.

615
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:18,520
But how should
I tell my heart?

616
00:49:19,110 --> 00:49:20,220
Mr. Shyam..

617
00:49:20,710 --> 00:49:23,490
...the heart can be a one's
good friend or a foe.

618
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:27,460
Do not give it a chance to
become your sworn enemy.

619
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:34,040
You did not recognize
a friend's touch.

620
00:49:44,290 --> 00:49:47,530
Madam, love between a thief
and police is not good.

621
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:48,750
Get inside.

622
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:05,150
Boss! The way she and
Inspector Shyam are getting close..

623
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:07,010
...could prove fatal for us.

624
00:50:07,310 --> 00:50:10,490
Lily, before you sell
yourself to inspector Shyam..

625
00:50:10,510 --> 00:50:12,400
...you should think
twice. - Boss!

626
00:50:12,530 --> 00:50:14,140
I am not a fool..

627
00:50:14,170 --> 00:50:15,640
...that I'd play
with my life for..

628
00:50:15,660 --> 00:50:17,190
...the sake of
my heart's calling.

629
00:50:17,230 --> 00:50:19,120
That's what I was
going to tell you.

630
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:21,850
Whoever deceives me
meets with his death.

631
00:50:21,930 --> 00:50:23,810
But I love life.

632
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:25,490
So instead of selling myself..

633
00:50:25,510 --> 00:50:27,780
...I want to buy
Inspector Shyam.

634
00:50:27,810 --> 00:50:31,260
If you're speaking the
truth then I am happy.

635
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:32,760
But for that
it is very necessary..

636
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:34,670
...that you order Jogi...

637
00:50:34,690 --> 00:50:38,660
...that he does what
I say for a few weeks.

638
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:40,470
Okay.

639
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:43,180
Not you may go.

640
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:47,440
You don't know me.

641
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:50,020
I was living abroad
for a few years.

642
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:51,620
I have returned today.

643
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:54,650
I came immediately as
I heard about Mr. Ram Dev.

644
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:57,260
Don't know what condition
you might be in.

645
00:50:57,740 --> 00:50:58,860
Look!

646
00:50:59,580 --> 00:51:03,000
As a friend I have
some responsibilities.

647
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:06,450
No, no! We're already
indebted to you.

648
00:51:06,750 --> 00:51:08,780
That you took the
trouble to come here.

649
00:51:09,570 --> 00:51:11,660
Even God abandons
you during bad times.

650
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:13,820
But how can I forget.

651
00:51:14,270 --> 00:51:16,300
Mr. Ramdev was
my good old friend.

652
00:51:16,910 --> 00:51:20,990
If you want to help me,
get Nita a job.

653
00:51:24,110 --> 00:51:26,660
If she gets a job, all our
difficulties will be solved.

654
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:29,830
As you wish. I know
a lot of companies.

655
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:32,160
I'll speak to them tomorrow
and get Nita a job.

656
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:35,110
Thank you very much!
- No, there's no need for it.

657
00:51:35,180 --> 00:51:37,100
Ok, madam. I'll bid adieu.
Greetings.

658
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:49,870
Ms. Judy, this is Ms. Nita.

659
00:51:50,410 --> 00:51:51,530
Our new receptionist.

660
00:51:51,770 --> 00:51:55,050
Explain to her all the duties
around here. - Yes, sir.

661
00:51:57,690 --> 00:52:00,060
I'll get the reservation
chart for tomorrow.

662
00:52:05,380 --> 00:52:08,450
Nita, did you like the job?
- Yes.

663
00:52:08,780 --> 00:52:11,160
Continue to work hard
with dedication.

664
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:13,940
I'll get you a better job
once I get the opportunity.

665
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:15,680
You'll get a better salary.

666
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:17,550
Thank you.

667
00:52:25,710 --> 00:52:29,910
We are doing our best in the
Hiralal jeweler's case.

668
00:52:30,130 --> 00:52:32,630
But yet nothing is known
about the culprits.

669
00:52:32,860 --> 00:52:37,060
They have to be arrested,
find out about them anyhow.

670
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:51,680
Is there a room booked in the name
of Mr. Tesumal Ludhani?

671
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:53,100
I had sent a telegram.

672
00:52:53,130 --> 00:52:55,130
Sir, your room
has been booked.

673
00:52:56,550 --> 00:53:00,550
Fill this register
and sign here.

674
00:53:00,580 --> 00:53:03,480
In which language?
- In English.

675
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:06,800
In English? Ok, I'll sign,
and you fill up the rest.

676
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:12,620
Come sir.

677
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:31,160
Yes, it's Hiralal speaking.
- This is Tesumal Ludhani.

678
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:33,980
Yes, I have got the diamonds.

679
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:40,260
Come now.
I have come for you.

680
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:46,300
I'll finish my work and
return by train tonight.

681
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:51,520
But come fast.
- Yes, I'll be there soon.

682
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:04,500
Come, Hiralal.
- Greetings! - Greetings!

683
00:54:04,530 --> 00:54:09,930
Sit down.
Tell me, how are you?

684
00:54:10,350 --> 00:54:15,450
Show me the diamonds.
- I will, but did you got cash?

685
00:54:15,470 --> 00:54:17,670
I have, why are
you so impatient?

686
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:22,200
I'm not impatient.
Both of us are jewelers.

687
00:54:22,220 --> 00:54:26,320
This is black marketing.
The deal should be good. - Yes.

688
00:54:27,950 --> 00:54:33,250
Look at them.
- They are great.

689
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:37,170
How much do they cost?
- I won't charge you more.

690
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:39,990
For you I'll charge
just 150,000 Rupees.

691
00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:45,420
150,000 Rupees.
Take this.

692
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:51,840
Here.
When will you come again?

693
00:54:51,870 --> 00:54:56,270
Now, I'll come frequently.
- Okay, I'll leave.

694
00:54:56,290 --> 00:55:01,190
But you didn't drink anything.
- Both of us jewelers.

695
00:55:01,210 --> 00:55:06,010
We will keep meeting again.
Now I'll leave.

696
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:09,140
Okay, greetings!
- Greetings!

697
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:19,660
Operator, connect
me to the proprietor.

698
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:24,680
Proprietor? This is Tasumal
Ludhani speaking.

699
00:55:25,010 --> 00:55:27,010
There is some work for you.

700
00:55:28,030 --> 00:55:31,790
I want a 1st class
ticket to Ilhabad...

701
00:55:31,810 --> 00:55:38,060
in Kolkata Express
for tonight.

702
00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:46,480
I want the ticket anyhow.
Thank you.

703
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:54,900
Greetings, Proprietor.
- Sir, here is your ticket.

704
00:55:55,230 --> 00:55:59,830
You yourself got my ticket?
- So that I could meet you.

705
00:55:59,850 --> 00:56:01,850
You took so much trouble.

706
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:05,380
We're sorry that you're
leaving today itself.

707
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:06,700
You didn't give us
a chance to serve you.

708
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:11,520
You'll get many chances.
I am going to come here regularly.

709
00:56:11,550 --> 00:56:16,150
Yes. - Please summon
a taxi for me to leave.

710
00:56:16,170 --> 00:56:18,170
You get ready, I'll call
for a taxi right away.

711
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:20,200
Okay. Thank you very much.

712
00:56:20,420 --> 00:56:23,220
A ticket from
Mumbai to Ilhabad.

713
00:57:18,590 --> 00:57:22,590
When will you serve it? - At around
9 p.m. at Igatpuri station.

714
00:57:22,610 --> 00:57:23,210
Okay.

715
00:57:24,420 --> 00:57:28,420
Pure vegetarian.

716
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:36,900
This is the compartment.
There is no compartment here.

717
00:57:36,930 --> 00:57:39,430
Here it is. Hurry up.
Load the baggage.

718
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:43,520
Where are you going, come out.

719
00:57:43,550 --> 00:57:47,550
Sir, money? - I don't a 100
rupee note, do you have the change?

720
00:57:47,870 --> 00:57:50,970
Sir, this is just 10 rupee.
- It's okay, come tomorrow.

721
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:04,380
Even you use it.
It is very useful.

722
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:07,100
I learnt this in an air plane.

723
00:58:07,130 --> 00:58:10,430
There, air troubles your ears,
and here the coal.

724
00:58:10,450 --> 00:58:13,750
Here, take it.
Help yourself. Take it.

725
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:37,040
So sorry. - Never mind.

726
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:49,590
Sir, read your newspaper!

727
00:58:50,980 --> 00:58:52,720
Are you travelling alone?

728
00:58:53,170 --> 00:58:55,060
Someone's with me. You.

729
00:58:59,950 --> 00:59:01,110
Thank you.

730
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:14,950
How far are you going?
- Nashik.

731
00:59:15,820 --> 00:59:17,980
I see. You live there?

732
00:59:18,950 --> 00:59:20,310
I work there.

733
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:23,890
I teach dance in
the Indian Dance School.

734
00:59:24,340 --> 00:59:27,960
Oh, so you teach dance?
Very good! Very good!

735
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:34,540
What is your name?
- Kalavati.

736
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:40,570
My name is Pyare.
I mean Mr. Pyarelal!

737
00:59:40,870 --> 00:59:44,700
But my friends and
the people who love me..

738
00:59:45,180 --> 00:59:46,440
...lovingly call me Pyare!

739
00:59:48,420 --> 00:59:49,530
Pyare.

740
00:59:50,330 --> 00:59:52,420
Pyare! - Pyare!

741
00:59:53,190 --> 00:59:54,730
What do you do?

742
00:59:57,390 --> 01:00:02,090
Nothing! I don't do anything.
I'm from a rich family.

743
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:06,100
Before doing something
I am thinking what should I do?

744
01:00:06,230 --> 01:00:08,820
After all what is
the aim of my life?

745
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:10,310
Did you understand anything?

746
01:00:11,970 --> 01:00:13,090
You did not.

747
01:00:13,990 --> 01:00:15,140
That's the problem.

748
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:17,440
Even my family does
not understand.

749
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:19,800
That's the reason why our
country could not progress.

750
01:00:19,910 --> 01:00:22,240
Our country's millions
and billions of youths..

751
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:24,710
...have not understood
what they have to do.

752
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:29,860
But you are different.

753
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:32,750
By your beautiful demeanor..

754
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:35,880
...it reflects that you
were born to dance.

755
01:00:36,150 --> 01:00:38,240
And I am a lover of art.

756
01:00:38,830 --> 01:00:40,680
Wow! Wow!

757
01:00:41,410 --> 01:00:45,170
Your lovely eyes and
this swan like neck..

758
01:00:45,930 --> 01:00:47,220
Wow!

759
01:00:58,110 --> 01:01:01,270
Tea! Tea! - Hey,
give a cup of tea!

760
01:01:02,140 --> 01:01:06,120
Igatpuri has come. But the
waiter has not got the food.

761
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:07,430
Food?!

762
01:01:09,140 --> 01:01:11,920
Ms. Kalavati!
- Just Kalavati.

763
01:01:12,270 --> 01:01:13,670
Oh, one and the same thing.

764
01:01:14,110 --> 01:01:16,200
I have forgotten to
order for food.

765
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:18,990
We'll take
refreshments at Karjat.

766
01:01:19,850 --> 01:01:22,120
By the time it reaches
here it goes cold.

767
01:01:22,290 --> 01:01:24,800
Okay! Okay! Please come.

768
01:01:25,420 --> 01:01:26,530
Nice!

769
01:01:36,660 --> 01:01:37,770
Hello!

770
01:01:41,140 --> 01:01:42,440
Hello!

771
01:01:44,550 --> 01:01:45,670
Hello!

772
01:01:51,550 --> 01:01:54,230
Oh! Please come!
Please sit down!

773
01:01:54,570 --> 01:01:55,690
Please sit.

774
01:01:56,630 --> 01:01:57,740
Sit down! Thank you!

775
01:01:58,750 --> 01:02:00,530
Boy! Waiter! Butler!

776
01:02:00,700 --> 01:02:03,520
Do not make noise!
What will people think?

777
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:05,650
It's getting late!
Boy! Waiter! But..

778
01:02:05,710 --> 01:02:07,250
Please relax.

779
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:10,730
There's still a lot of time.

780
01:02:11,660 --> 01:02:15,180
Tell me, sir. - We've not come
here to talk but to eat.

781
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:17,160
But sir, if you don't talk
then how will you get food.

782
01:02:17,290 --> 01:02:19,740
Vegetarian or non-vegetarian?
Vegetables or mutton?

783
01:02:20,630 --> 01:02:21,780
What all is there?

784
01:02:22,340 --> 01:02:24,430
Mutton special, mutton fry,
mutton masala, mutton gravy..

785
01:02:24,490 --> 01:02:26,310
...mutton mince or coca-cola?

786
01:02:26,510 --> 01:02:30,490
For sir, potato and peas,
biryani (Fried rice)..

787
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:32,710
And piping hot bread.

788
01:02:33,190 --> 01:02:34,900
And madam, for you?

789
01:02:36,500 --> 01:02:38,380
You tell me what should I eat?

790
01:02:38,450 --> 01:02:40,530
Madam will eat what I eat.

791
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:41,930
Okay sir and madam.

792
01:02:41,990 --> 01:02:43,220
And listen! Come here.

793
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:45,830
Bring hot chutney also for me.

794
01:02:46,550 --> 01:02:48,960
Look sir, whatever you want
to order, order at one go.

795
01:02:49,020 --> 01:02:50,770
I have a lot of work.
- Okay! Okay!

796
01:02:50,830 --> 01:02:53,130
Get hot chutney for me.

797
01:02:53,720 --> 01:02:55,880
Okay? - Hot chutney?!
- Hurry up! Hurry up!

798
01:02:56,570 --> 01:02:59,330
Sir! - Yes, keep it here.
Here! Keep it here.

799
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:03,400
Now where are the fritters?
- I'll get it right now, sir.

800
01:03:03,460 --> 01:03:04,580
Hurry up!

801
01:03:07,780 --> 01:03:09,070
Very good food!

802
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:22,120
Oh! The train is leaving!
- It's not our train.

803
01:03:22,670 --> 01:03:26,570
It is Bombay bound train.
- Oh! Thank God!

804
01:03:27,540 --> 01:03:28,690
I got scared.

805
01:03:31,050 --> 01:03:33,600
Sir, where do you have to go?
- To hell.

806
01:03:33,660 --> 01:03:35,650
Sir, why are you getting
angry for nothing?

807
01:03:35,710 --> 01:03:38,260
The Kolkata Express was
leaving that's why I asked.

808
01:03:41,630 --> 01:03:42,920
Oh! Water.

809
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:52,590
Sir! Sir, bill!

810
01:03:52,830 --> 01:03:54,960
Take it from the madam.
- Sir, madam has gone.

811
01:03:55,370 --> 01:03:57,080
What? She's gone?!

812
01:03:57,150 --> 01:03:59,830
8 rupees, sir!
- Here take 10 rupees.

813
01:04:03,060 --> 01:04:05,500
Hey! Wait!

814
01:04:07,100 --> 01:04:09,330
My luggage! Stop the train!

815
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:14,330
Station Master!
Station Master!

816
01:04:14,470 --> 01:04:16,990
Station Master!
- He's in that room. - Oh!

817
01:04:18,470 --> 01:04:20,360
Sir, may I come in?!

818
01:04:27,350 --> 01:04:28,820
Station Master sir..
- What is it?

819
01:04:28,910 --> 01:04:30,830
I am looted.
I've lost everything.

820
01:04:30,930 --> 01:04:32,640
What happened?
- The train has left!

821
01:04:32,810 --> 01:04:35,140
The train has left?!
The train had to go.

822
01:04:35,210 --> 01:04:38,410
And my luggage is also gone.
See, here is my ticket.

823
01:04:38,930 --> 01:04:41,270
This is which Puri? - Igatpuri.

824
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:42,550
Now I am stuck here.

825
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:46,110
You do not worry.
I'll telephone right now.

826
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:48,290
Your luggage will be unloaded
at the next station.

827
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:50,590
My luggage will be
there and I here.

828
01:04:50,690 --> 01:04:52,680
You'll also be sent
by the next train.

829
01:04:52,740 --> 01:04:54,410
I see! Thank you!

830
01:05:04,810 --> 01:05:06,290
Nishik! - Yes?

831
01:05:07,460 --> 01:05:10,390
Okay. When the train arrives
we'll unload the luggage.

832
01:05:11,080 --> 01:05:12,930
What did you say?
Mr. Pyarelal?

833
01:05:13,510 --> 01:05:15,290
1st class B compartment?

834
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:53,650
Which other passenger was
travelling in this compartment?

835
01:06:53,780 --> 01:06:56,610
A girl who must have
got off at the station.

836
01:06:56,880 --> 01:06:58,480
Her ticket valid till Igatpuri.

837
01:06:58,760 --> 01:07:00,790
And a man who's
name was Pyarelal.

838
01:07:01,190 --> 01:07:02,310
Pyarelal?

839
01:07:02,380 --> 01:07:04,440
Who missed his train
at the police station?

840
01:07:04,740 --> 01:07:06,560
For whose luggage
we got a call?

841
01:07:08,150 --> 01:07:09,230
Oh I see!

842
01:07:17,300 --> 01:07:18,420
Yes!

843
01:07:19,910 --> 01:07:21,030
What?

844
01:07:22,070 --> 01:07:24,190
Yes. Mr. Pyarelal?

845
01:07:25,790 --> 01:07:27,680
Yes. He's here.

846
01:07:30,180 --> 01:07:31,290
Ok.

847
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:34,070
Ok.

848
01:07:42,910 --> 01:07:44,870
Keep an eye on that man.

849
01:07:47,750 --> 01:07:49,530
But he shouldn't
know about it.

850
01:08:31,300 --> 01:08:35,770
Brother, do you have a matchbox?
Well, I don't smoke.

851
01:09:01,850 --> 01:09:05,970
The child born is healthy!
The mother is also healthy!

852
01:09:06,240 --> 01:09:08,990
Small family..
Happy family!

853
01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:19,700
Listen, when is
the train arriving?

854
01:09:21,540 --> 01:09:22,660
It is going to come now.

855
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:24,720
Coolie! Get my luggage!

856
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:27,010
Give me tea.

857
01:09:30,100 --> 01:09:31,850
Tea. - Here.

858
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:19,650
Station Master!
Station Master!

859
01:10:19,820 --> 01:10:21,390
Are you the Station Master?
- Yes.

860
01:10:21,460 --> 01:10:23,520
I am Pyarelal.
Give me my luggage.

861
01:10:23,580 --> 01:10:25,700
Oh, we were waiting for you.

862
01:10:26,190 --> 01:10:28,000
Come. - Come on.

863
01:10:31,370 --> 01:10:33,780
Come. - You found my luggage.

864
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:35,380
This is it! Thank you.

865
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:38,680
And this?

866
01:10:41,950 --> 01:10:43,870
Quiet! Do you think ..

867
01:10:43,930 --> 01:10:46,270
...we'll believe you
and let you go?

868
01:10:46,780 --> 01:10:49,300
I'll go mad. I'll go mad.

869
01:10:50,050 --> 01:10:52,570
When I speak,
you tell me to shut up!

870
01:10:53,320 --> 01:10:55,910
When I'm quiet you
ask me to speak up!

871
01:10:56,460 --> 01:10:58,650
When I'm sleeping,
you ask me to wake up!

872
01:10:58,720 --> 01:10:59,870
Those are my orders!

873
01:10:59,930 --> 01:11:02,020
I'm not a murderer
or a killer.

874
01:11:02,090 --> 01:11:04,500
If you didn't commit
the murder then who did?

875
01:11:04,910 --> 01:11:07,180
When you got out at Igatpuri
station for lunch was there..

876
01:11:07,690 --> 01:11:09,690
...anyone else in
the compartment?

877
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:11,840
The businessman.
- Dead or alive?

878
01:11:12,250 --> 01:11:13,650
He was having lunch. Lunch!

879
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:16,120
Why did you go to
the refreshment room?

880
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:18,730
To eat. Every man gets hungry.

881
01:11:18,860 --> 01:11:20,890
The food could be ordered
in the compartment.

882
01:11:22,340 --> 01:11:24,400
What's the reason to go
to the refreshment room?

883
01:11:25,090 --> 01:11:26,630
One girl. - Oh!

884
01:11:26,900 --> 01:11:29,940
Yes, sir. There was a girl
in the compartment.

885
01:11:30,590 --> 01:11:32,820
She said that
we'll dine there.

886
01:11:33,020 --> 01:11:34,490
Do you know that
girl from before?

887
01:11:34,940 --> 01:11:37,060
No, sir. - It was
our first meeting.

888
01:11:37,550 --> 01:11:40,060
I saw her. She saw me.

889
01:11:40,360 --> 01:11:43,080
She acted coy.
I acted even more coy.

890
01:11:43,630 --> 01:11:45,970
Then we chatted.

891
01:11:46,490 --> 01:11:48,680
She lovingly gave me
a Nagpur orange.

892
01:11:48,990 --> 01:11:52,060
Then we went to the
refreshment room for lunch.

893
01:11:52,710 --> 01:11:55,020
Suddenly that girl
disappeared from there.

894
01:11:55,110 --> 01:11:57,700
Ok. - Yes! - This means that..

895
01:11:58,210 --> 01:11:59,330
...the girl got back to her..

896
01:11:59,390 --> 01:12:01,210
...compartment before
the train left.

897
01:12:01,270 --> 01:12:03,020
I don't know that.
- What do you know?!

898
01:12:03,080 --> 01:12:04,410
I don't know.

899
01:12:04,470 --> 01:12:05,770
When I turned around
after washing my hands..

900
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:07,300
...the girl was gone.

901
01:12:07,640 --> 01:12:10,230
When I ran towards the
platform, the train had left.

902
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:12,270
What did you say your
name was? - Pyarelal.

903
01:12:12,370 --> 01:12:17,560
Pyarelal, Can you recognise
twenty to thirty girls?

904
01:12:17,690 --> 01:12:19,200
Forget twenty to thirty!

905
01:12:19,330 --> 01:12:21,630
I'll recognise Kalavati
amongst millions.

906
01:12:21,700 --> 01:12:22,950
Kalavati! - Yes, sir.

907
01:12:23,090 --> 01:12:25,120
She's given me
her address too.

908
01:12:25,420 --> 01:12:28,690
She teaches dance in this city
at the Indian Dance Academy.

909
01:12:29,250 --> 01:12:31,370
I think she teaches
aggressive dancing.

910
01:12:34,850 --> 01:12:35,960
Mr. Pyarelal.
- Yes.

911
01:12:36,240 --> 01:12:38,090
Maybe you haven't
committed the murder.

912
01:12:38,330 --> 01:12:40,490
If I haven't committed the
murder, please let me go.

913
01:12:40,620 --> 01:12:41,840
Thank you very much
for the investigation.

914
01:12:42,810 --> 01:12:44,280
Bye! - Wait a second,
Mr. Pyarelal.

915
01:12:45,150 --> 01:12:49,390
Till we don't find
Ms. Kalavati's we can't let you go.

916
01:12:49,560 --> 01:12:52,210
We'll go to the address
that you've given us.

917
01:12:53,460 --> 01:12:55,210
Together! - Together?!

918
01:12:55,830 --> 01:12:57,120
Sir.

919
01:12:57,570 --> 01:12:58,680
Together!

920
01:13:02,710 --> 01:13:06,270
Indian Dance School!
Got it! Come on! Hurry up!

921
01:13:10,020 --> 01:13:12,220
Mr. Peon!
- Who do you want, sir?

922
01:13:12,420 --> 01:13:13,990
Is there a Ms. Kalavati here?

923
01:13:14,060 --> 01:13:15,910
Yes, sir.
She teaches dance here.

924
01:13:16,180 --> 01:13:18,100
Oh, very good. This is it.

925
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:19,590
We have to meet her.

926
01:13:19,660 --> 01:13:20,610
Tell her we are here.
What should I do?!

927
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:22,170
She is taking the rehearsal.

928
01:13:22,230 --> 01:13:23,380
You'll have to
wait for some time.

929
01:13:23,450 --> 01:13:25,410
Okay, we'll wait. You please
sit down. - Yes, I'll sit down.

930
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:27,980
Thank you!

931
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:15,330
<i>Under the shadow
of the stars!</i>

932
01:14:15,530 --> 01:14:19,890
<i>My beloved came quietly!</i>

933
01:14:20,160 --> 01:14:23,920
<i>He came and held my hand!</i>

934
01:14:23,990 --> 01:14:27,330
<i>What should I do?!</i>

935
01:14:27,960 --> 01:14:31,480
<i>Oh, what should I do?!</i>

936
01:14:32,790 --> 01:14:37,250
<i>Under the shadow
of the stars!</i>

937
01:14:37,310 --> 01:14:41,220
<i>My beloved came quietly!</i>

938
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:44,830
<i>He came and held my hand!</i>

939
01:14:44,900 --> 01:14:47,270
<i>What should I do?!</i>

940
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:27,560
<i>That man from the
city was a thief.</i>

941
01:15:31,900 --> 01:15:35,880
<i>That man from the
city was a thief.</i>

942
01:15:36,180 --> 01:15:39,150
<i>He robbed me of my sleep.</i>

943
01:15:40,360 --> 01:15:44,080
<i>He's a sweet talker.</i>

944
01:15:44,150 --> 01:15:47,640
<i>I, the village
belle, trusted him.</i>

945
01:15:48,710 --> 01:15:52,950
<i>Those romantic eyes.
Those lovely talks.</i>

946
01:15:53,020 --> 01:15:56,920
<i>Those romantic eyes.
Those lovely talks.</i>

947
01:15:57,200 --> 01:16:00,330
<i>How can I forget?!</i>

948
01:16:00,470 --> 01:16:01,760
<i>What should I do?!</i>

949
01:16:01,820 --> 01:16:04,050
<i>Oh, what should I do?!</i>

950
01:16:04,540 --> 01:16:05,900
<i>What should I do?!</i>

951
01:16:05,960 --> 01:16:08,190
<i>What.. What should I do!?</i>

952
01:16:09,270 --> 01:16:13,520
<i>Under the shadow
of the stars!</i>

953
01:16:13,580 --> 01:16:17,790
<i>My beloved came quietly!</i>

954
01:16:17,860 --> 01:16:21,280
<i>He came and held my hand!</i>

955
01:16:21,590 --> 01:16:22,740
<i>What should I do?!</i>

956
01:16:56,130 --> 01:17:03,370
<i>The ruthless didn't have
mercy on my tender age.</i>

957
01:17:08,690 --> 01:17:15,800
<i>The ruthless didn't have
mercy on my tender age.</i>

958
01:17:16,940 --> 01:17:21,060
<i>His eyes peered at me.</i>

959
01:17:21,180 --> 01:17:24,220
<i>Like an arrow
shoots from the bow.</i>

960
01:17:25,430 --> 01:17:29,600
<i>He did not hear any excuse.</i>

961
01:17:29,670 --> 01:17:33,430
<i>He did not hear any excuse.</i>

962
01:17:33,670 --> 01:17:36,910
<i>I pleaded a lot with him.</i>

963
01:17:36,980 --> 01:17:38,090
<i>What should I do?!</i>

964
01:17:38,160 --> 01:17:40,500
<i>Oh, what should I do?!</i>

965
01:17:41,080 --> 01:17:42,200
<i>What should I do?!</i>

966
01:17:42,270 --> 01:17:44,600
<i>What.. What should I do!?</i>

967
01:17:45,960 --> 01:17:50,170
<i>Under the shadow
of the stars!</i>

968
01:17:50,230 --> 01:17:54,410
<i>My beloved came quietly!</i>

969
01:17:54,550 --> 01:17:57,790
<i>He came and held my hand!</i>

970
01:17:57,920 --> 01:17:59,850
<i>What should I do?!</i>

971
01:18:10,140 --> 01:18:11,250
Listen!

972
01:18:13,550 --> 01:18:16,260
But you..
- My name is Kalavati.

973
01:18:16,430 --> 01:18:17,550
Tell me what is it?

974
01:18:19,740 --> 01:18:21,930
Something is wrong.
She is not the same girl.

975
01:18:22,940 --> 01:18:24,860
Is there any other
girl called Kalavati?

976
01:18:24,990 --> 01:18:26,390
No. I'm the only one.

977
01:18:26,770 --> 01:18:28,790
I am sorry. It's a mistake
because of the name.

978
01:18:34,250 --> 01:18:37,450
It means, that girl gave you
her name and address wrong.

979
01:18:38,350 --> 01:18:39,640
According to the
railway reservations..

980
01:18:39,710 --> 01:18:42,570
...her name was Geeta and her
ticket was up to Igatpuri.

981
01:18:43,540 --> 01:18:46,050
But what would
she gain by deceiving me?

982
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:48,200
This girl is definitely
connected with..

983
01:18:48,270 --> 01:18:49,670
...businessman
Tesumal's murder.

984
01:18:49,800 --> 01:18:52,240
That's why she did not
want you to know her..

985
01:18:52,300 --> 01:18:53,770
...real name and address.

986
01:18:54,290 --> 01:18:57,250
Strange!
Such a beautiful girl..

987
01:18:57,700 --> 01:19:00,140
...and so sly and cunning?

988
01:19:00,300 --> 01:19:04,590
Pyare, until that girl is
found, you'll stay with me.

989
01:19:04,930 --> 01:19:06,710
Because only you
recognize her.

990
01:19:07,300 --> 01:19:08,860
It means that
I am your prisoner?

991
01:19:08,930 --> 01:19:10,780
Not a prisoner but
my companion.

992
01:19:11,860 --> 01:19:12,930
Your companion?

993
01:19:13,700 --> 01:19:17,120
Companion, I am fed up of
roaming about with you.

994
01:19:17,320 --> 01:19:20,450
Actually some of
my relatives live here.

995
01:19:20,590 --> 01:19:23,170
Can I go and meet them? Yes,
definitely you may go.

996
01:19:23,300 --> 01:19:24,560
But you should
return soon, okay?

997
01:19:24,690 --> 01:19:27,210
This vehicle will take you
there and bring you back.

998
01:19:27,270 --> 01:19:29,530
No! If I go by this
police vehicle..

999
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:31,720
...then my relatives
will think..

1000
01:19:31,790 --> 01:19:33,080
...that I am some
thief or a hooligan.

1001
01:19:33,320 --> 01:19:34,690
I'll go walking.

1002
01:19:34,820 --> 01:19:36,150
You trust me, right?

1003
01:19:36,210 --> 01:19:37,500
Yes of course, I trust you.

1004
01:19:37,710 --> 01:19:39,180
Come, I'll drop you
to the taxi.

1005
01:19:51,480 --> 01:19:55,350
Here, take 30 rupees. If you
want more I'll give later.

1006
01:19:56,080 --> 01:19:58,560
So much money?
10 rupees are fine.

1007
01:20:00,700 --> 01:20:01,820
Thank you.

1008
01:20:05,330 --> 01:20:06,450
Hey, taxi!

1009
01:20:07,170 --> 01:20:09,370
Down the meter.
Come on, hurry up.

1010
01:20:09,440 --> 01:20:11,390
I am in a hurry.
I've a very important work.

1011
01:20:13,050 --> 01:20:14,600
No, I don't want. Hey, Tonga!

1012
01:20:14,760 --> 01:20:16,750
Down your meter.
Come on, hurry up!

1013
01:20:16,810 --> 01:20:17,890
Come on. Don't waste time!

1014
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:19,980
Oh, what to do..

1015
01:20:22,730 --> 01:20:23,840
Keep an eye on him.

1016
01:20:34,490 --> 01:20:38,630
There is a thief
after you, traveler.

1017
01:20:51,950 --> 01:20:54,180
Hey, stop the Tonga! Stop!

1018
01:21:00,620 --> 01:21:03,020
Oh, it's the same girl.
Stop! Stop!

1019
01:21:03,220 --> 01:21:04,380
Hey, taxi driver!

1020
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:29,150
My key!

1021
01:21:59,340 --> 01:22:01,720
In 7 years what's your score?

1022
01:22:02,930 --> 01:22:06,130
Three?! You are
far way behind me.

1023
01:22:06,340 --> 01:22:08,980
Are you doing family planning?

1024
01:22:10,370 --> 01:22:14,550
I? By the grace
of God I have 7.

1025
01:22:14,690 --> 01:22:16,430
And 8th one..

1026
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:18,870
...is expected. - Mother!

1027
01:22:19,210 --> 01:22:21,860
Mother, think of me
also as your child.

1028
01:22:21,990 --> 01:22:24,080
But at least let me make
a telephone call. - Shut up!

1029
01:22:24,390 --> 01:22:26,660
Aren't you ashamed of
calling young woman mother?

1030
01:22:26,720 --> 01:22:28,200
Some old hag must
be your mother.

1031
01:22:28,260 --> 01:22:29,660
Get lost!

1032
01:22:30,760 --> 01:22:32,020
Can I make a call?

1033
01:22:38,170 --> 01:22:40,160
Hello! Hello, police station?

1034
01:22:40,780 --> 01:22:42,520
I'd like to speak to
Inspector Shyam.

1035
01:22:42,590 --> 01:22:43,710
Hurry up! Hurry up!

1036
01:22:44,780 --> 01:22:46,350
Hello, Inspector Shyam?

1037
01:22:46,630 --> 01:22:49,000
I am Pyarelal speaking.
Yes! Yes!

1038
01:22:49,480 --> 01:22:51,040
I am speaking from
the telephone.

1039
01:22:51,700 --> 01:22:54,010
Listen, the girl whom we are
looking for is right here.

1040
01:22:54,730 --> 01:22:58,220
Yes! I am at the corner of
the 1st street near the..

1041
01:22:58,390 --> 01:23:00,450
...Bharat Tourist Lodge, waiting
for you. Come soon. Hurry up!

1042
01:23:01,410 --> 01:23:02,560
How much?

1043
01:23:03,220 --> 01:23:04,340
Keep the rupee.

1044
01:23:10,210 --> 01:23:12,100
Why hasn't inspector
Shyam come yet?

1045
01:23:12,440 --> 01:23:13,800
Hey, stop!

1046
01:23:13,870 --> 01:23:16,100
Oh! What are you doing?

1047
01:23:16,510 --> 01:23:17,630
Stop!

1048
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:20,270
Come on!

1049
01:23:27,370 --> 01:23:28,480
Come on!

1050
01:23:29,590 --> 01:23:31,100
Hurry up! Hurry up!

1051
01:23:33,980 --> 01:23:36,390
Excellent! Thank you for
coming, Inspector Shyam.

1052
01:23:39,820 --> 01:23:42,580
Didn't I tell you that this
girl can not escape from me?

1053
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:44,000
Now you'll see.

1054
01:23:49,390 --> 01:23:50,540
Caught you!

1055
01:23:52,210 --> 01:23:53,320
But the girl is not here.

1056
01:23:53,390 --> 01:23:54,650
You had seen the girl
getting into this room?

1057
01:23:54,710 --> 01:23:56,310
I had seen her myself.

1058
01:23:56,380 --> 01:23:57,950
She went in this same
8 number room.

1059
01:23:58,020 --> 01:23:59,900
Then where is the girl?
- I don't know where she has gone.

1060
01:24:00,040 --> 01:24:01,600
She has fooled us once more.

1061
01:24:03,620 --> 01:24:05,220
Now what happened?
Where are you going?

1062
01:24:06,120 --> 01:24:07,940
Who was in room no.8
a little while ago?

1063
01:24:08,280 --> 01:24:09,400
Ms. Prabhavati.

1064
01:24:09,740 --> 01:24:12,530
Prabhavati?! But she'd said
that her name was Kala..

1065
01:24:13,050 --> 01:24:14,200
But she is not in the room.

1066
01:24:14,270 --> 01:24:16,010
She left a short while
ago for the station.

1067
01:24:16,080 --> 01:24:18,070
She is boarding Kolkata
Express and going to Mumbai.

1068
01:24:18,440 --> 01:24:19,560
Thank you.

1069
01:24:47,390 --> 01:24:50,590
Oh, the train has left and
it has taken the girl too.

1070
01:25:51,510 --> 01:25:53,540
You meet me at the Igatpuri
station with the jeep.

1071
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:54,710
Okay!

1072
01:27:23,390 --> 01:27:24,960
Don't know where
she is hiding.

1073
01:27:28,020 --> 01:27:29,140
The girl could not be found.

1074
01:27:30,070 --> 01:27:31,510
You'll have to go
to Mumbai. - Ok.

1075
01:27:32,130 --> 01:27:33,280
Come on, let's go.

1076
01:27:57,460 --> 01:28:00,350
Hello! Inspector Shyam
is trailing me.

1077
01:28:00,660 --> 01:28:02,220
I've alighted at Igatpuri.

1078
01:28:02,430 --> 01:28:03,690
They are reaching Mumbai.

1079
01:28:24,240 --> 01:28:26,550
Come on! Come on!
- I am feeling sleepy.

1080
01:28:26,610 --> 01:28:28,280
I want to sleep - Come on!

1081
01:28:28,350 --> 01:28:31,070
Till the girl is found,
I won't let you rest.

1082
01:28:32,660 --> 01:28:33,780
Yes, please?

1083
01:28:35,870 --> 01:28:37,720
I want to see Kolkata
Express's reservation..

1084
01:28:37,880 --> 01:28:39,390
...chart for yesterday.

1085
01:28:39,690 --> 01:28:40,910
Please sit down. - Thank you.

1086
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:48,680
B compartment..

1087
01:28:49,400 --> 01:28:50,660
Mr. Pyarelal.

1088
01:28:51,310 --> 01:28:52,500
Booking by Pyarelal.

1089
01:28:53,400 --> 01:28:57,130
Businessman Tesumal, booking
by Mehta & Co. Travel Agents.

1090
01:28:57,780 --> 01:29:01,340
Ms. Geeta, booking by
Mehta & Co. Travel Agents.

1091
01:29:03,490 --> 01:29:06,040
Mehta & Co. Travel Agents..

1092
01:29:08,080 --> 01:29:11,080
Yes. The day before yesterday
we had booked 2 seats..

1093
01:29:11,460 --> 01:29:14,350
...on Kolkata Express.
What say? - Yes!

1094
01:29:14,520 --> 01:29:16,820
No.1 - Tesumal Ludhani.

1095
01:29:17,410 --> 01:29:19,670
He booked the ticket
from Hotel Hilltop.

1096
01:29:19,950 --> 01:29:21,200
What say? - Yes!

1097
01:29:21,620 --> 01:29:23,320
No.2 - Ms. Geeta.

1098
01:29:23,810 --> 01:29:25,730
She herself booked the ticket.

1099
01:29:25,860 --> 01:29:29,140
Her address is Young Girls'
Hostel, Bandra 50.

1100
01:29:30,380 --> 01:29:32,020
Yes. - Yes!

1101
01:29:32,120 --> 01:29:33,760
Let's go! Thank you.

1102
01:29:39,600 --> 01:29:41,670
You've been told many
times that you should..

1103
01:29:41,730 --> 01:29:43,720
...come on time. But you..

1104
01:29:43,780 --> 01:29:45,630
Good evening, madam!
- Greetings.

1105
01:29:45,900 --> 01:29:47,190
But.. It's a matter of shame.

1106
01:29:47,540 --> 01:29:48,760
When you are a pure Indian..

1107
01:29:48,820 --> 01:29:50,220
...still you use
a foreign language.

1108
01:29:50,390 --> 01:29:52,870
What language are
you speaking?

1109
01:29:53,100 --> 01:29:54,920
Lord, please forgive them.

1110
01:29:55,120 --> 01:29:57,320
They have forgotten their
culture and language.

1111
01:29:57,700 --> 01:30:00,450
Tell me, why have
you come here?

1112
01:30:00,510 --> 01:30:04,240
We.. We want to personally
meet Ms. Geeta.

1113
01:30:04,310 --> 01:30:06,680
You want to personally
see Ms. Geeta. You go.

1114
01:30:06,850 --> 01:30:07,960
Okay. - Sit down.

1115
01:30:08,860 --> 01:30:10,010
Sit down.

1116
01:30:10,150 --> 01:30:11,900
Which Geeta? - Sit here.

1117
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:14,120
Is he asleep?

1118
01:30:15,200 --> 01:30:17,460
Which Geeta? Geeta Kapoor,
Geeta Khosla, Geeta Pandy..

1119
01:30:17,530 --> 01:30:18,780
...or Geeta Verma?

1120
01:30:19,160 --> 01:30:21,710
But mister, what's
the reason to meet her?

1121
01:30:26,540 --> 01:30:29,810
Oh! We have 6 Geetas here.

1122
01:30:29,950 --> 01:30:32,880
Can you call all
of them here? - Sure!

1123
01:30:35,170 --> 01:30:37,250
Sheela, call all Geetas.

1124
01:30:45,290 --> 01:30:46,930
Greetings!

1125
01:31:01,540 --> 01:31:04,150
Our Geeta is not amongst them.

1126
01:31:05,780 --> 01:31:07,110
You please ask them to go.

1127
01:31:07,380 --> 01:31:08,500
All of you may go.

1128
01:31:09,400 --> 01:31:12,530
1, 2, s, 4, 5..

1129
01:31:13,610 --> 01:31:15,530
...but where is the 6th Geeta?

1130
01:31:15,800 --> 01:31:17,720
I am the 6th Geeta.

1131
01:31:18,270 --> 01:31:19,600
Mother, you...?

1132
01:31:20,290 --> 01:31:21,860
Isn't there some young Geeta?

1133
01:31:22,410 --> 01:31:25,760
Yes, upstairs in my room
there's another Geeta.

1134
01:31:25,930 --> 01:31:27,080
Bhagvad Geeta (Holy Book).

1135
01:31:27,150 --> 01:31:28,650
If you say then
I can bring it also here.

1136
01:31:28,710 --> 01:31:30,840
No! No! Please don't
take trouble. Anyway..

1137
01:31:30,900 --> 01:31:32,340
...good night! I mean,
pleasant night.

1138
01:32:44,170 --> 01:32:46,620
Yes, sir? - I want a
suite or a double room.

1139
01:32:50,820 --> 01:32:51,940
We are sorry,
sir. A suite..

1140
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:53,960
...or a double room
is not available.

1141
01:32:54,510 --> 01:32:59,490
We have singles. - But we are
two people and I.. I..

1142
01:33:00,210 --> 01:33:01,470
Take two single rooms, sir.

1143
01:33:02,300 --> 01:33:03,380
Okay!

1144
01:33:08,770 --> 01:33:10,410
Are these rooms
near each other?

1145
01:33:10,650 --> 01:33:12,720
Sorry, sir. They are not.

1146
01:33:14,440 --> 01:33:15,560
Will do.

1147
01:33:16,740 --> 01:33:17,850
Thank you, sir.

1148
01:33:19,730 --> 01:33:22,380
Your name, sir. - Mr. Shyam
Kumar and Mr. Pyarelal.

1149
01:33:24,250 --> 01:33:27,390
Address? - 1994 Main
Street, Poona.

1150
01:33:28,640 --> 01:33:30,670
Medical representative.

1151
01:33:31,280 --> 01:33:32,610
Will you sign here?

1152
01:33:52,330 --> 01:33:53,480
Bye, Julie! - Nita!

1153
01:33:54,070 --> 01:33:56,270
You and here?
- I am a receptionist here.

1154
01:33:56,330 --> 01:33:58,220
Listen to me.
- I am sorry!

1155
01:34:13,800 --> 01:34:14,950
Take this.

1156
01:34:17,520 --> 01:34:19,060
Listen, here's the room key.

1157
01:34:19,160 --> 01:34:20,480
I'll be back in short while.

1158
01:34:25,730 --> 01:34:26,850
Nita!

1159
01:34:29,590 --> 01:34:32,000
Nita, I know that you
don't like meeting me.

1160
01:34:32,270 --> 01:34:34,720
But I think it's very
important to tell you..

1161
01:34:34,780 --> 01:34:36,970
...that the people where
you work are not very nice.

1162
01:34:37,460 --> 01:34:39,410
How good are good people,
I have experienced.

1163
01:34:39,930 --> 01:34:41,880
And if anybody
sees you talking..

1164
01:34:41,940 --> 01:34:43,100
...to a murderer's
daughter then?

1165
01:34:43,160 --> 01:34:44,560
Don't be stubborn, Nita.

1166
01:34:44,690 --> 01:34:46,330
You father has
committed a murder.

1167
01:34:46,400 --> 01:34:48,320
What good will it do
to punish yourself?

1168
01:34:48,800 --> 01:34:50,230
And I've read
the Police report..

1169
01:34:50,290 --> 01:34:52,700
...and the court's decision.

1170
01:34:52,760 --> 01:34:55,170
Every evidence and witness
statements are all against him.

1171
01:34:55,690 --> 01:34:56,910
Those evidences are planted.

1172
01:34:56,970 --> 01:34:58,720
Those witness
statements are false.

1173
01:34:58,780 --> 01:35:00,010
How can you say that?

1174
01:35:00,770 --> 01:35:03,030
When my father
entered that room..

1175
01:35:03,240 --> 01:35:05,360
...the firm's owner was
lying there, bleeding.

1176
01:35:06,090 --> 01:35:08,360
Father went and drew out
the dagger from his chest..

1177
01:35:09,010 --> 01:35:11,350
...and tried to stop
the bleeding.

1178
01:35:11,690 --> 01:35:13,200
But when that did not happen..

1179
01:35:13,260 --> 01:35:15,420
...he started screaming
and shouting.

1180
01:35:15,690 --> 01:35:16,950
People gathered there.

1181
01:35:17,470 --> 01:35:18,900
But nobody thought..

1182
01:35:18,960 --> 01:35:20,080
...that a murderer
after committing..

1183
01:35:20,150 --> 01:35:21,260
...a murder tries to escape.

1184
01:35:21,680 --> 01:35:24,050
He does not scream
and call people.

1185
01:35:25,050 --> 01:35:28,050
Nita, today you've drawn
my attention to a new point.

1186
01:35:28,570 --> 01:35:30,450
If your father is
really innocent..

1187
01:35:30,720 --> 01:35:32,680
...then I'll try my level
best to save him.

1188
01:35:33,050 --> 01:35:34,200
This is my promise to you.

1189
01:35:34,550 --> 01:35:35,700
This is my oath.

1190
01:35:36,290 --> 01:35:38,320
But in order to fulfill
your promise..

1191
01:35:38,480 --> 01:35:40,020
...if your duty
stops you then?

1192
01:36:09,650 --> 01:36:11,580
Hello! Police headquarters?

1193
01:36:12,230 --> 01:36:13,870
This is Inspector
Shyam speaking.

1194
01:36:24,090 --> 01:36:25,210
Okay!

1195
01:36:26,670 --> 01:36:27,780
Come in!

1196
01:36:31,640 --> 01:36:32,760
Hi handsome!

1197
01:36:33,660 --> 01:36:34,810
Hi, Lily!

1198
01:36:35,850 --> 01:36:38,990
First tell me where were you?

1199
01:36:39,330 --> 01:36:42,500
I was out of town for
an important work. But..

1200
01:36:42,980 --> 01:36:44,490
...who told you
that I am here?

1201
01:36:45,280 --> 01:36:49,330
No one tells the flower,
where's the bee.

1202
01:36:50,150 --> 01:36:54,510
Wherever be the flower,
the bee follows. - Really?!

1203
01:36:55,680 --> 01:36:56,840
But Shyam..

1204
01:36:57,490 --> 01:36:58,790
...you have your
own house here..

1205
01:36:59,300 --> 01:37:01,050
...then why are you
staying in this hotel.

1206
01:37:01,150 --> 01:37:02,440
To be near you.

1207
01:37:06,430 --> 01:37:08,630
I don't believe it. - Why?

1208
01:37:10,050 --> 01:37:14,890
I feel that you are playing
some game with me.

1209
01:37:16,730 --> 01:37:17,960
You don't believe me?

1210
01:37:21,740 --> 01:37:23,250
Then how should
I make you believe?

1211
01:37:25,080 --> 01:37:27,730
By staying in front
of my eyes always.

1212
01:37:31,030 --> 01:37:33,100
Tonight you are my guest.

1213
01:37:36,670 --> 01:37:38,520
There is a special
program in the hotel.

1214
01:37:38,650 --> 01:37:40,640
And it is the last
night of this year.

1215
01:37:41,610 --> 01:37:44,430
And I want you to be with me..

1216
01:37:45,470 --> 01:37:46,980
...when the new year starts.

1217
01:37:48,710 --> 01:37:49,860
I agree.

1218
01:37:56,950 --> 01:37:58,700
A man can live without food.

1219
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:00,330
He can even live
without sleep.

1220
01:38:00,430 --> 01:38:01,650
But without clothes..

1221
01:38:03,250 --> 01:38:04,960
Excuse me.. Oh!

1222
01:38:08,020 --> 01:38:10,700
He is my friend. He is
staying in the same hotel.

1223
01:38:10,760 --> 01:38:12,200
Oh! - Come on, Pyare. Why are
you hiding there? Come out.

1224
01:38:12,260 --> 01:38:14,870
No. I am very shy of people.

1225
01:38:14,940 --> 01:38:16,130
Are you a girl? - No!

1226
01:38:16,190 --> 01:38:17,860
Then are you a boy? - No!
- Then what are you?

1227
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,120
Oh no! I am not that!

1228
01:38:20,540 --> 01:38:22,660
The thing is that
I am very shy of girls.

1229
01:38:22,730 --> 01:38:24,550
But she is my friend Lily.

1230
01:38:24,610 --> 01:38:26,150
There's no need
to hide from me.

1231
01:38:26,210 --> 01:38:27,920
Then tell your friend to hide.

1232
01:38:28,300 --> 01:38:29,940
How can I come naked
in front of her?

1233
01:38:30,390 --> 01:38:32,510
Okay, let's go.
- But why!

1234
01:38:33,620 --> 01:38:36,210
Shyam! - Yes? - Do not
forget your promise.

1235
01:38:37,240 --> 01:38:40,210
And yes, bring along
your friend too.

1236
01:38:40,270 --> 01:38:41,380
Why not?!

1237
01:38:43,570 --> 01:38:46,580
She's gone? Is she coming
back.. - What is this?

1238
01:38:47,120 --> 01:38:49,190
The thing that
I was feeling very hot.

1239
01:38:49,240 --> 01:38:50,920
So in a hurry I bathed
with my clothes on.

1240
01:38:51,260 --> 01:38:53,490
Now only this towel
is left to wear..

1241
01:38:53,560 --> 01:38:55,480
...which is also not ours.
- Okay, take some money.

1242
01:38:55,580 --> 01:38:56,730
The shops are still open.
Send somebody..

1243
01:38:56,860 --> 01:38:58,120
...to get you some clothes.
- Okay. - And listen..

1244
01:38:58,570 --> 01:39:00,240
...get ready soon. We've to
go to the hall downstairs.

1245
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:01,600
Lots of people are coming.

1246
01:39:01,670 --> 01:39:02,780
It's possible
that Geeta also come.

1247
01:39:02,850 --> 01:39:04,250
I am going to wear the
clothes and go to sleep.

1248
01:39:04,310 --> 01:39:06,860
I am very sleepy. - Then,
to sleep a towel is enough.

1249
01:39:07,130 --> 01:39:09,360
Why is the towel also
necessary? - It is not.

1250
01:39:09,530 --> 01:39:12,170
No! No! I was just joking.
You took it seriously.

1251
01:39:12,240 --> 01:39:13,640
No! I'll come!
- Ok. - I'll come!

1252
01:39:13,700 --> 01:39:15,590
You do understand the
situation, but take time.

1253
01:39:16,170 --> 01:39:17,290
It's alright.

1254
01:39:29,430 --> 01:39:34,200
<i>I've yet not given my heart,
how would I know?</i>

1255
01:39:34,260 --> 01:39:38,550
<i>I've yet not given my heart,
how would I know?</i>

1256
01:39:38,610 --> 01:39:41,440
<i>I'm innocent and
you a stranger.</i>

1257
01:39:41,500 --> 01:39:43,420
<i>Why should I agree?</i>

1258
01:39:47,660 --> 01:39:52,160
<i>I've yet not given my heart,
how would I know?</i>

1259
01:39:52,360 --> 01:39:56,530
<i>I've yet not given my heart,
how would I know?</i>

1260
01:40:19,740 --> 01:40:23,430
<i>We have met just today.</i>

1261
01:40:24,230 --> 01:40:27,710
<i>There are complaints
on our lips.</i>

1262
01:40:29,240 --> 01:40:32,370
<i>We'll meet more often.</i>

1263
01:40:33,690 --> 01:40:37,070
<i>Then we'll talk about love.</i>

1264
01:40:37,970 --> 01:40:41,730
<i>We have met just today.</i>

1265
01:40:42,670 --> 01:40:46,220
<i>There are complaints
on our lips.</i>

1266
01:40:47,400 --> 01:40:50,740
<i>We'll meet more often.</i>

1267
01:40:52,060 --> 01:40:55,510
<i>Then we'll talk about love.</i>

1268
01:40:58,390 --> 01:41:02,820
<i>I've not yet loved,
how would I know?</i>

1269
01:41:02,910 --> 01:41:05,740
<i>I'm innocent and
you a stranger.</i>

1270
01:41:05,800 --> 01:41:07,270
<i>Why should I agree?</i>

1271
01:41:11,890 --> 01:41:16,420
<i>I've yet not given my heart,
how would I know?</i>

1272
01:41:16,660 --> 01:41:21,260
<i>I've yet not given my heart,
how would I know?</i>

1273
01:41:41,850 --> 01:41:45,750
<i>I've heard it hundred
times from people.</i>

1274
01:41:46,580 --> 01:41:50,520
<i>That love is intoxicating.</i>

1275
01:41:51,550 --> 01:41:54,900
<i>I'll take two sips
and then I'll tell.</i>

1276
01:41:55,970 --> 01:41:59,870
<i>Then I'll tell
you how I feel.</i>

1277
01:42:00,250 --> 01:42:03,810
<i>I've heard it hundred
times from people.</i>

1278
01:42:04,600 --> 01:42:08,580
<i>That love is intoxicating.</i>

1279
01:42:09,580 --> 01:42:12,960
<i>I'll take two sips
and then I'll tell.</i>

1280
01:42:14,030 --> 01:42:18,150
<i>Then I'll tell
you how I feel.</i>

1281
01:42:20,500 --> 01:42:25,000
<i>I've not drunk this wine,
how would I know?</i>

1282
01:42:25,160 --> 01:42:29,620
<i>I've not drunk this wine,
how would I know?</i>

1283
01:42:29,720 --> 01:42:32,400
<i>I'm innocent and
you a stranger.</i>

1284
01:42:32,470 --> 01:42:33,900
<i>Why should I agree?</i>

1285
01:42:38,240 --> 01:42:43,120
<i>I've yet not given my heart,
how would I know?</i>

1286
01:43:03,990 --> 01:43:06,220
Rita, my darling..

1287
01:43:06,980 --> 01:43:08,830
Oh, no!

1288
01:43:09,420 --> 01:43:10,530
Oh!

1289
01:43:19,160 --> 01:43:23,550
Rita, my darling!

1290
01:43:24,930 --> 01:43:27,130
Come! Come!

1291
01:43:28,520 --> 01:43:30,680
Oh! Heavy!

1292
01:43:34,080 --> 01:43:35,380
I'll be back soon!

1293
01:43:43,720 --> 01:43:47,660
What's this?
Is it Rita or a demon?

1294
01:43:54,890 --> 01:43:56,110
Why have you come
to this hotel?

1295
01:43:56,180 --> 01:43:57,990
I have come here to sleep.

1296
01:43:58,060 --> 01:44:00,910
Tell me the truth or
I'll strangle you.

1297
01:44:01,290 --> 01:44:03,420
I've come here to
recognize a murderer.

1298
01:44:03,480 --> 01:44:04,670
There is a girl named Geeta.

1299
01:44:04,740 --> 01:44:08,880
If you try to recognize
Geeta then I'll kill you.

1300
01:44:10,370 --> 01:44:11,740
If you want to live..

1301
01:44:11,940 --> 01:44:14,730
...then right now go away from
this hotel and this city. Go!

1302
01:44:15,070 --> 01:44:17,550
I'll do whatever
you say, my lord.

1303
01:44:17,610 --> 01:44:20,090
If you don't do that then
I'll have to do this.

1304
01:44:28,390 --> 01:44:29,510
Pyare!

1305
01:44:31,840 --> 01:44:33,130
Pyare!

1306
01:44:34,590 --> 01:44:35,920
Pyare!

1307
01:44:37,020 --> 01:44:38,350
Pyare!

1308
01:44:45,650 --> 01:44:47,810
What's the matter?
Why do you look troubled?

1309
01:44:47,880 --> 01:44:49,550
Nothing! Nothing!

1310
01:44:49,620 --> 01:44:51,020
You're concealing
something from me.

1311
01:44:51,080 --> 01:44:53,240
A few minutes ago you
couldn't even wake up.

1312
01:44:53,370 --> 01:44:56,270
And now.. - I can't tell you.
I can't tell you.

1313
01:44:56,330 --> 01:44:58,670
Don't forget that you're
talking to a police inspector.

1314
01:44:58,730 --> 01:45:01,320
And if I want I can
send you to prison.

1315
01:45:01,380 --> 01:45:02,780
You'll send me to prison.

1316
01:45:02,840 --> 01:45:04,200
He'll kill me.

1317
01:45:04,440 --> 01:45:06,530
What should I do?
- Who'll kill you?

1318
01:45:07,010 --> 01:45:08,830
Tell me! Tell me!

1319
01:45:09,270 --> 01:45:10,880
When I opened
the lock and came in..

1320
01:45:10,940 --> 01:45:12,200
...there was a terrible
man in here.

1321
01:45:12,410 --> 01:45:13,880
He tried to strangle me.

1322
01:45:13,970 --> 01:45:17,420
And he said that if you try
to recognised Geeta..

1323
01:45:17,620 --> 01:45:19,260
I will kill you.

1324
01:45:19,330 --> 01:45:20,840
Where's the room key?
- It was with me.

1325
01:45:21,070 --> 01:45:22,960
If the key was with you,
how did he get in?

1326
01:45:23,330 --> 01:45:25,530
He knows that best.
He ordered me..

1327
01:45:25,730 --> 01:45:28,860
...that I should leave this
hotel and city immediately.

1328
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:31,680
This means there are
other people behind..

1329
01:45:31,750 --> 01:45:33,190
...this murder other than Geeta.

1330
01:45:33,250 --> 01:45:34,680
This hotel is their den.

1331
01:45:34,880 --> 01:45:37,810
Do you know they were
following us when we arrived?

1332
01:45:37,870 --> 01:45:40,350
I want to go.
Stop following me.

1333
01:45:40,410 --> 01:45:42,500
You won't go anywhere.
You'll stay here.

1334
01:45:42,570 --> 01:45:44,460
I'm scared. - I'm with you.

1335
01:45:44,800 --> 01:45:46,470
Don't you trust me? - I do!

1336
01:45:46,540 --> 01:45:47,790
Come with me to my room.

1337
01:45:48,310 --> 01:45:50,610
Come. Will your
pyjamas fit me?

1338
01:45:56,910 --> 01:45:59,100
Come on, undress and
go to sleep. - What?

1339
01:46:00,040 --> 01:46:02,620
But I sleep in my pajamas
in the night.

1340
01:46:02,850 --> 01:46:04,670
My night suit is inside.
Go and take it.

1341
01:46:11,660 --> 01:46:13,260
I am here.
- Then come and sleep.

1342
01:46:13,640 --> 01:46:15,940
You please sleep here.
I'll sleep there.

1343
01:46:16,010 --> 01:46:17,510
Just give me a pillow.

1344
01:46:17,920 --> 01:46:19,770
Here you are.
- Thank you.

1345
01:46:25,020 --> 01:46:27,210
Good night!
- Good night!

1346
01:47:03,880 --> 01:47:06,840
Shyam! - Lily, come with me.

1347
01:47:10,770 --> 01:47:13,320
I am very anxious
about you, Lily. - Why?

1348
01:47:13,790 --> 01:47:15,120
I am a police inspector..

1349
01:47:15,500 --> 01:47:18,010
...and have come here to nab
some notorious criminals.

1350
01:47:18,070 --> 01:47:19,190
I know.

1351
01:47:19,260 --> 01:47:21,590
In spite of knowing you are
playing the love game with me?

1352
01:47:21,690 --> 01:47:23,360
To confuse me?

1353
01:47:23,570 --> 01:47:26,250
No, Shyam. I really love you.

1354
01:47:26,390 --> 01:47:27,580
You are lying.

1355
01:47:28,060 --> 01:47:30,950
Lily, you know very
well what you are.

1356
01:47:32,970 --> 01:47:34,530
The criminals
whom I am searching..

1357
01:47:34,600 --> 01:47:36,240
...are in this hotel only.

1358
01:47:36,790 --> 01:47:38,460
And you are
connected with them.

1359
01:47:38,710 --> 01:47:42,500
Lily, if I want I can
arrest you but I pity you.

1360
01:47:43,050 --> 01:47:46,220
May be you are doing this
under some duress and stress.

1361
01:47:46,810 --> 01:47:51,800
But I hope that when the Law
nabs them you are not with them.

1362
01:47:52,940 --> 01:47:55,550
What do you want?
- Their names.

1363
01:47:56,520 --> 01:47:59,240
If you promise me that you'll
make me yours then..

1364
01:47:59,300 --> 01:48:00,630
In the matters of heart..

1365
01:48:00,690 --> 01:48:02,130
...there should not be
any conditions, Lily.

1366
01:48:02,750 --> 01:48:05,260
But it is not
safe to talk here.

1367
01:48:05,500 --> 01:48:07,100
They are very dangerous.

1368
01:48:07,440 --> 01:48:09,370
I'll change and be
back in a minute.

1369
01:48:09,670 --> 01:48:11,480
Till then you
wait for me here.

1370
01:50:13,600 --> 01:50:14,710
Pyare!

1371
01:50:18,990 --> 01:50:20,320
Operator!

1372
01:50:21,080 --> 01:50:22,550
Give me the police control.

1373
01:50:22,960 --> 01:50:24,700
Police control,
inspector Shyam here.

1374
01:50:25,010 --> 01:50:28,120
Car No. KLP 4761 has just
now left from Hotel Hilltop.

1375
01:50:28,320 --> 01:50:30,900
Immediately take over the car
and arrest the people in it.

1376
01:50:31,200 --> 01:50:32,320
That's it.

1377
01:50:39,240 --> 01:50:40,390
Drive faster!

1378
01:50:44,770 --> 01:50:46,590
Hurry up! Hurry up! Faster!

1379
01:50:47,630 --> 01:50:48,740
Good!

1380
01:50:49,640 --> 01:50:50,760
Drive faster!

1381
01:50:53,190 --> 01:50:54,340
Faster! Hurry!

1382
01:50:54,900 --> 01:50:56,010
Hurry up!

1383
01:50:56,390 --> 01:50:57,650
Hurry up! Faster!

1384
01:50:59,210 --> 01:51:00,400
Faster! Faster!

1385
01:51:00,980 --> 01:51:02,730
They are gaining on us!

1386
01:51:03,420 --> 01:51:05,510
Yes! Very good! Faster!

1387
01:51:09,020 --> 01:51:11,470
Good! Very good!
Drive faster! Faster!

1388
01:51:11,530 --> 01:51:12,820
Very good! Very good!

1389
01:51:23,950 --> 01:51:25,690
Come out!
- What's the matter?

1390
01:51:25,760 --> 01:51:27,460
Who is the owner of
this car? - I am.

1391
01:51:27,670 --> 01:51:29,450
Come to the police station.
- But what have I done?

1392
01:51:29,510 --> 01:51:31,440
You'll know once there.
Take him.

1393
01:51:46,910 --> 01:51:48,420
Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

1394
01:51:51,290 --> 01:51:52,660
Your name? - John.

1395
01:51:53,760 --> 01:51:55,790
Last night when
the police arrested you..

1396
01:51:56,300 --> 01:51:58,710
...from where were you coming?
- I was just roaming about.

1397
01:51:58,840 --> 01:52:01,490
Looking for passengers.
My car is a private taxi.

1398
01:52:01,940 --> 01:52:05,140
Yesterday your car was at
Hotel Hilltop? - No, sir.

1399
01:52:05,940 --> 01:52:08,390
I am saying that it was there.
I saw it myself.

1400
01:52:08,790 --> 01:52:10,540
It must be some other
car, inspector.

1401
01:52:11,120 --> 01:52:13,250
You are lying.
- I am telling the truth.

1402
01:52:16,550 --> 01:52:17,880
You can not deceive us.

1403
01:52:18,190 --> 01:52:19,790
You may believe or not.

1404
01:52:20,240 --> 01:52:21,990
I have not gone to that Hotel
for the past many days.

1405
01:52:22,080 --> 01:52:24,800
And besides me no one
else drives that car.

1406
01:52:25,080 --> 01:52:28,010
Believe me.
- Inspector Kapoor! - Yes, sir.

1407
01:52:28,630 --> 01:52:30,410
I think he is telling
the truth. Release him.

1408
01:52:32,100 --> 01:52:33,950
Here, take your license.
- Thank you, sir.

1409
01:52:35,270 --> 01:52:36,390
Inspector Shyam..

1410
01:52:44,490 --> 01:52:46,520
You were told to leave
this city and go. - Yes.

1411
01:52:46,580 --> 01:52:47,690
Then why did you not go.

1412
01:52:47,760 --> 01:52:49,960
When you release me
then I'll go, right?

1413
01:52:50,090 --> 01:52:51,840
Don't worry! - Thank you.

1414
01:52:52,320 --> 01:52:54,130
When you starve
for 2 to 4 days..

1415
01:52:54,410 --> 01:52:56,920
...then you'll automatically
go away from the world. Tony..

1416
01:52:58,090 --> 01:53:00,020
...keep a stern
eye on this man.

1417
01:53:00,360 --> 01:53:02,310
Don't give him anything
to eat and drink.

1418
01:53:02,370 --> 01:53:04,500
I won't get even porridge?
- Shut up!

1419
01:53:08,500 --> 01:53:09,610
Orange!

1420
01:53:09,780 --> 01:53:12,010
Eat more oranges
in the train!

1421
01:53:12,640 --> 01:53:15,600
You wanted to love
that girl, Pyarelal.

1422
01:53:15,870 --> 01:53:17,870
Now you'll go to
meet the God.

1423
01:53:18,060 --> 01:53:20,150
Now go and eat lovely
oranges there.

1424
01:53:20,530 --> 01:53:21,830
Water!

1425
01:53:22,870 --> 01:53:23,980
Water!

1426
01:53:28,640 --> 01:53:31,250
Oh! She is the same girl.

1427
01:53:31,320 --> 01:53:33,440
The one who had fed me
orange in the train.

1428
01:53:33,510 --> 01:53:35,500
I found her!
I found the girl.

1429
01:53:35,570 --> 01:53:37,940
Inspector Shyam,
come fast I found the girl.

1430
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:39,640
Now where will you escape?

1431
01:53:40,680 --> 01:53:41,970
No! No! - Eat it!

1432
01:53:42,040 --> 01:53:44,070
No, I'll not eat
the orange by your hand.

1433
01:53:44,120 --> 01:53:47,090
I'll not eat. Shyam,
come soon the girl is found.

1434
01:53:47,430 --> 01:53:51,400
What are you doing?
Oh! Deceit! Deceit!

1435
01:53:51,640 --> 01:53:53,280
A decent man is deceived.

1436
01:53:53,410 --> 01:53:56,970
Oh, now where has she gone?
Inspector Shyam!

1437
01:54:08,830 --> 01:54:10,190
The police have
release you? - Yes.

1438
01:54:10,250 --> 01:54:12,280
I hope nobody
has followed you?

1439
01:54:12,340 --> 01:54:15,270
I hope nobody has followed you?
I clearly denied everything.

1440
01:54:15,330 --> 01:54:18,150
Good! Very good! Look,
we had sent Raja..

1441
01:54:18,220 --> 01:54:21,260
...in the guise of a beggar
to find out about you.

1442
01:54:21,320 --> 01:54:23,550
Did he meet you? - I'd seen him
outside the police station.

1443
01:54:23,610 --> 01:54:25,120
He should be here
any minute now.

1444
01:54:26,670 --> 01:54:29,220
You keep an eye on Pyare.
- Ok, boss.

1445
01:55:23,980 --> 01:55:26,380
So, you've come back after
fooling the police?

1446
01:55:27,110 --> 01:55:29,720
Now drink to your heart's
content. Enjoy yourself.

1447
01:55:32,460 --> 01:55:34,840
I also will drink
coca-cola! - Shut up!

1448
01:55:42,280 --> 01:55:46,000
Raja, come and
play two hands.

1449
01:55:47,010 --> 01:55:48,120
No?

1450
01:56:16,620 --> 01:56:18,610
Beware! Do not step forward.

1451
01:57:19,210 --> 01:57:22,730
Bloody fools! Shyam came
and freed Pyare.

1452
01:57:22,860 --> 01:57:25,860
And our men just keep gaping
at him. Shame on you.

1453
01:57:26,410 --> 01:57:28,600
Sorry, Boss.
Now what should be done?

1454
01:57:29,160 --> 01:57:34,410
Find Pyarelal and somehow
silence him forever. - Ok, Boss.

1455
01:57:34,790 --> 01:57:36,790
And instruct our men that..

1456
01:57:36,910 --> 01:57:39,470
...no one should go back to
that place. - Okay, Boss.

1457
01:57:42,200 --> 01:57:44,990
Enough! It's just enough!
Let me go!

1458
01:57:45,060 --> 01:57:46,840
No, Pyarelal. Until..

1459
01:57:46,900 --> 01:57:48,790
...Geeta and her companions
are not arrested..

1460
01:57:48,850 --> 01:57:50,970
...you'll stay in Mumbai.
Under the police protection.

1461
01:57:51,350 --> 01:57:52,990
If you go out then
it is possible..

1462
01:57:53,060 --> 01:57:54,560
...that they might
try to harm you.

1463
01:57:54,730 --> 01:57:57,590
Now how can I stay in Mumbai?

1464
01:57:57,760 --> 01:58:01,800
Neither do have clothes to eat
nor money to wear. - No! No!

1465
01:58:01,860 --> 01:58:03,950
Clothes to wear and money to
eat will be given to you.

1466
01:58:04,020 --> 01:58:05,170
Do not worry at all.

1467
01:58:05,410 --> 01:58:07,260
Take whatever amount of
money you want from me.

1468
01:58:08,230 --> 01:58:09,340
Hey!

1469
01:58:11,250 --> 01:58:13,730
Hey! She is that girl.

1470
01:58:13,790 --> 01:58:14,910
She is Geeta!

1471
01:58:15,150 --> 01:58:17,280
You are a crackpot. Every girl
looks like Geeta to you.

1472
01:58:17,340 --> 01:58:19,120
But I am saying
that she is Geeta.

1473
01:58:19,290 --> 01:58:21,660
She is the one for whom
you are harassing me.

1474
01:58:21,730 --> 01:58:22,840
The girl is right
under your nose..

1475
01:58:22,910 --> 01:58:23,870
...and you pose
you don't know?

1476
01:58:23,930 --> 01:58:26,110
Pyare, look at this
picture carefully.

1477
01:58:26,320 --> 01:58:29,040
Do not try to make
a fool out of me?

1478
01:58:29,100 --> 01:58:31,930
I think you have also shook
hands with those goons.

1479
01:58:31,990 --> 01:58:34,080
I'll lodge a complaint with
the Police Commissioner.

1480
01:58:34,150 --> 01:58:35,330
Are you sure that
she is Geeta?

1481
01:58:35,400 --> 01:58:38,220
I take an oath on holy book
Geeta that she is Geeta!

1482
01:58:38,290 --> 01:58:40,030
She is Geeta! She is Geeta!
She is Geeta!

1483
01:58:50,810 --> 01:58:52,840
Hilltop Hotel! Good afternoon!

1484
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:55,200
Good afternoon.
I am Shyam speaking.

1485
01:58:55,440 --> 01:58:57,560
I want to talk to you about
something very important.

1486
01:58:57,630 --> 01:59:00,380
Sorry! I don't have
time to talk idle.

1487
01:59:00,900 --> 01:59:04,140
I am talking as a C.I.D
police officer right now.

1488
01:59:04,210 --> 01:59:06,300
If I want can summon
you rlght away..

1489
01:59:06,360 --> 01:59:08,220
...by sending the police
vehicle. But..

1490
01:59:08,730 --> 01:59:10,400
...but I don't want to do this.

1491
01:59:10,640 --> 01:59:12,530
That's why this evening
you'll meet me..

1492
01:59:12,590 --> 01:59:14,480
...on the shore of the
same lake where..

1493
01:59:15,240 --> 01:59:17,050
...where we used to meet.

1494
01:59:48,810 --> 01:59:54,240
'Hey! - Nita, is this
a dream or the truth?'

1495
01:59:54,970 --> 01:59:56,260
'Dream.'

1496
01:59:56,710 --> 01:59:59,390
'Now go away.
And never come back.'

1497
02:00:02,340 --> 02:00:06,590
'I had never thought that
you'll become so hard.'

1498
02:00:09,890 --> 02:00:13,350
'Nita, you don't
even remember that..

1499
02:00:14,070 --> 02:00:17,380
...we had taken an oath of
living and dying together.'

1500
02:00:18,590 --> 02:00:20,160
'We had made many promises.'

1501
02:00:21,100 --> 02:00:22,530
'Dreamt a lot of dreams.'

1502
02:00:32,750 --> 02:00:35,300
'Nita, you have also
forgotten those days..

1503
02:00:36,300 --> 02:00:40,170
...when we used to
sing love duets.'

1504
02:00:40,230 --> 02:00:43,060
<i>Oh, my darling!</i>

1505
02:00:43,120 --> 02:00:45,350
<i>Oh, my darling!</i>

1506
02:00:45,700 --> 02:00:52,520
<i>Leave my drape,
you heartless man.</i>

1507
02:00:52,690 --> 02:00:58,050
<i>Leave my drape,
you heartless man.</i>

1508
02:00:58,500 --> 02:01:02,890
<i>I've become restless.</i>

1509
02:01:03,020 --> 02:01:05,150
<i>Oh, my darling!</i>

1510
02:01:05,870 --> 02:01:08,100
<i>Oh, my darling!</i>

1511
02:01:32,940 --> 02:01:38,270
<i>In name only you
are my darling.</i>

1512
02:01:38,510 --> 02:01:44,460
<i>In name only
I'm your beloved.</i>

1513
02:01:44,530 --> 02:01:49,890
<i>The flower's play with
your silky hair.</i>

1514
02:01:49,960 --> 02:01:55,320
<i>I just keep gaping
from afar.</i>

1515
02:01:55,770 --> 02:01:58,210
<i>No! No! - Yes! Yes!</i>

1516
02:01:58,510 --> 02:02:00,990
<i>By God, no! - Why not?</i>

1517
02:02:01,510 --> 02:02:06,870
<i>Mad lover is your name.</i>

1518
02:02:07,420 --> 02:02:11,670
<i>I am in love with you.</i>

1519
02:02:11,870 --> 02:02:14,140
<i>Oh, my darling!</i>

1520
02:02:30,590 --> 02:02:35,850
<i>In the whole world, my love.</i>

1521
02:02:36,230 --> 02:02:42,080
<i>There must not be
another lover like you.</i>

1522
02:02:42,140 --> 02:02:47,360
<i>To steal the sleep
and rob the peace.</i>

1523
02:02:47,680 --> 02:02:52,930
<i>Some thief should
learn from you.</i>

1524
02:02:53,520 --> 02:02:55,820
<i>No! No! - Yes! Yes!</i>

1525
02:02:56,410 --> 02:02:58,600
<i>Belle!
- What is it, my love?</i>

1526
02:02:59,470 --> 02:03:09,320
<i>I am your paramour.
I kept awake the night.</i>

1527
02:03:09,490 --> 02:03:12,010
<i>Oh, my darling!</i>

1528
02:03:12,310 --> 02:03:14,610
<i>Oh, my darling!</i>

1529
02:03:16,520 --> 02:03:21,850
<i>Leave my drape,
you heartless man.</i>

1530
02:03:22,190 --> 02:03:26,610
<i>I've become restless.</i>

1531
02:03:26,750 --> 02:03:28,830
<i>Oh, my darling!</i>

1532
02:03:29,390 --> 02:03:31,350
<i>Oh, my darling!</i>

1533
02:03:57,080 --> 02:03:59,390
<i>Let it be wind.</i>

1534
02:03:59,690 --> 02:04:02,300
<i>Let it be light.</i>

1535
02:04:02,550 --> 02:04:07,250
<i>I won't let them touch you.</i>

1536
02:04:08,500 --> 02:04:13,710
<i>If you are jealous, hide me
in your heart, my love.</i>

1537
02:04:19,870 --> 02:04:22,250
<i>No! No! - Yes! Yes!</i>

1538
02:04:22,590 --> 02:04:25,070
<i>My queen!
- What is it, my king?</i>

1539
02:04:25,750 --> 02:04:31,220
<i>Your body is like
a rain cloud.</i>

1540
02:04:31,390 --> 02:04:35,820
<i>My eyes are thirsty.</i>

1541
02:04:35,910 --> 02:04:38,670
<i>Oh, my darling!</i>

1542
02:04:38,760 --> 02:04:41,070
<i>Oh, my darling!</i>

1543
02:04:42,450 --> 02:04:48,100
<i>Leave my drape,
you heartless man.</i>

1544
02:04:48,400 --> 02:04:52,760
<i>I've become restless.</i>

1545
02:04:52,930 --> 02:04:55,440
<i>Oh, my darling!</i>

1546
02:04:55,670 --> 02:04:57,040
<i>Oh, my darling!</i>

1547
02:05:18,600 --> 02:05:19,720
Nita..

1548
02:05:22,050 --> 02:05:23,900
Nita, I want to
ask you something.

1549
02:05:25,070 --> 02:05:26,990
I am waiting to hear it.

1550
02:05:29,840 --> 02:05:33,490
People change but their
names don't change.

1551
02:05:34,430 --> 02:05:37,540
What do you mean? - Since
when did you become Geeta?

1552
02:05:37,980 --> 02:05:39,130
My name is Nita.

1553
02:05:39,550 --> 02:05:40,870
May be you have forgotten.

1554
02:05:41,430 --> 02:05:42,580
You said it right.

1555
02:05:43,230 --> 02:05:44,460
People change.

1556
02:05:44,700 --> 02:05:45,920
On 30th December..

1557
02:05:45,980 --> 02:05:47,900
...why had you gone to
Nashik by Kolkata Express?

1558
02:05:48,530 --> 02:05:51,830
I did not go anywhere. I was here.
- You are lying.

1559
02:05:52,050 --> 02:05:54,150
This is not lies.
And even if it is...

1560
02:05:54,180 --> 02:05:57,780
...may I know who
are you to ask this?

1561
02:05:57,800 --> 02:06:00,600
Who all were involved with
you in Tesumal's murder?

1562
02:06:02,120 --> 02:06:04,120
Don't try to act innocent.

1563
02:06:04,150 --> 02:06:08,250
Tell me the truth. I can send
you to jail right now if I wish.

1564
02:06:08,270 --> 02:06:12,270
Shyam, I didn't imagine
that you could be so mean.

1565
02:06:12,300 --> 02:06:14,200
I rejected your love.

1566
02:06:14,220 --> 02:06:16,520
So you want to take a
revenge and malign me...

1567
02:06:16,540 --> 02:06:19,540
...by using your position.

1568
02:06:34,560 --> 02:06:39,260
You were warned for the last
time, don't try to mess with us.

1569
02:06:39,280 --> 02:06:41,680
Even then, you did not heed.
Now...

1570
02:06:44,810 --> 02:06:46,810
All the murders which
took place in the trains...

1571
02:06:46,830 --> 02:06:48,830
...they were all for
diamonds and jewelry.

1572
02:06:48,850 --> 02:06:51,450
All the people left
from Hotel Hill Top.

1573
02:06:51,480 --> 02:06:53,280
And their seats
were booked together...

1574
02:06:53,300 --> 02:06:56,000
...through Mehta
& Company Travel Agents.

1575
02:06:56,980 --> 02:07:01,380
And in every murder,
there was some girl involved.

1576
02:07:02,410 --> 02:07:06,310
This time the girl
who has helped them...

1577
02:07:06,830 --> 02:07:08,830
I'm ashamed to say.

1578
02:07:09,550 --> 02:07:11,650
She was my would be fiancee.

1579
02:07:14,480 --> 02:07:17,980
At least I'm glad that
personal relationship...

1580
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:20,300
...did not make
you neglect your duty.

1581
02:07:20,330 --> 02:07:25,330
We need evidence to
arrest all these people.

1582
02:07:25,650 --> 02:07:27,650
I have thought
of a plan for that.

1583
02:07:27,670 --> 02:07:30,170
You have full
permission on our behalf.

1584
02:07:30,200 --> 02:07:32,200
You can do anything you wish.

1585
02:07:47,430 --> 02:07:48,430
As soon as you called...

1586
02:07:48,460 --> 02:07:51,160
...I've booked the
best hotel room for you.

1587
02:07:52,270 --> 02:07:54,270
Listen.

1588
02:07:54,300 --> 02:07:57,900
Is there any kind
of danger here?

1589
02:07:57,920 --> 02:08:00,920
I have very precious
things with me.

1590
02:08:00,940 --> 02:08:03,840
What do I have?
- Very precious things.

1591
02:08:03,870 --> 02:08:07,370
But don't worry. Consider
this hotel like your home.

1592
02:08:09,890 --> 02:08:12,090
Please sign here,
we'll fill up the rest.

1593
02:08:19,470 --> 02:08:24,770
You are Lord of which place?
- I am not, I was a landlord.

1594
02:08:25,100 --> 02:08:27,800
We lost our land.

1595
02:08:27,820 --> 02:08:29,820
Now I'm only lord.

1596
02:08:32,300 --> 02:08:35,700
Please come. Waiter,
bring his luggage to the room.

1597
02:08:38,650 --> 02:08:41,350
You can tell me if I can
do anything else for you.

1598
02:08:41,380 --> 02:08:43,380
Nothing special.

1599
02:08:44,370 --> 02:08:47,670
I've come here
only for a day or two.

1600
02:08:47,690 --> 02:08:51,190
I have some diamonds.

1601
02:08:51,210 --> 02:08:53,210
What do I have?
- Diamonds.

1602
02:08:53,240 --> 02:08:55,040
Which I want to sell.

1603
02:08:55,060 --> 02:08:56,360
Can you tell me the name of...

1604
02:08:56,390 --> 02:08:59,490
...one of the big
diamond merchants here?

1605
02:08:59,510 --> 02:09:02,210
I will present the bigger
diamond merchant to you.

1606
02:09:02,230 --> 02:09:05,030
But there's one thing.
I accept money in black.

1607
02:09:05,060 --> 02:09:06,760
In what?
- In black?

1608
02:09:06,780 --> 02:09:08,480
You can talk it out yourself.

1609
02:09:08,510 --> 02:09:11,210
I will send him to you.
He won't refuse to you.

1610
02:09:11,230 --> 02:09:15,230
Alright. Send him to me
tomorrow at 4 p.m.

1611
02:09:15,250 --> 02:09:21,650
And book a 1st class ticket
of Calcutta Express.

1612
02:09:22,580 --> 02:09:26,580
And look, there are very
precious diamonds in these bags.

1613
02:09:26,600 --> 02:09:28,400
Is it safe to keep
them in this room?

1614
02:09:28,420 --> 02:09:31,320
Don't worry at all.
Consider this as your home.

1615
02:09:39,710 --> 02:09:44,410
Wow!
What a priceless diamond!

1616
02:09:44,940 --> 02:09:48,540
It's worth Rs. 1 lakh.

1617
02:09:48,560 --> 02:09:51,360
It will be sold for
Rs. 2 lakh in the market.

1618
02:09:51,390 --> 02:09:53,590
How much?
- Rs 2 lakhs.

1619
02:09:54,360 --> 02:09:56,860
Rest of the diamonds
are in the box.

1620
02:09:56,880 --> 02:09:58,880
Where are they?
- In the box.

1621
02:09:58,900 --> 02:10:01,400
But I want just these diamonds.

1622
02:10:01,430 --> 02:10:06,630
Because I have... look...
just this much money. Look.

1623
02:10:06,650 --> 02:10:09,350
How much ever money
you have, is enough.

1624
02:10:09,380 --> 02:10:11,380
What is enough?
- Money.

1625
02:10:11,400 --> 02:10:13,700
But I won't give you a receipt.

1626
02:10:13,720 --> 02:10:15,720
What will I not give?
- Receipt.

1627
02:10:15,750 --> 02:10:19,850
Forget the receipt.
I want your trust.

1628
02:10:19,870 --> 02:10:23,470
I will take your leave.
Goodbye.

1629
02:10:23,500 --> 02:10:25,500
What did I say?
- Goodbye!

1630
02:10:38,840 --> 02:10:40,840
Here's your train ticket.

1631
02:10:40,860 --> 02:10:42,860
Is your work done properly?

1632
02:10:42,890 --> 02:10:46,290
Well! Not yet.

1633
02:10:46,310 --> 02:10:49,210
Had the money to buy
only a few diamonds.

1634
02:10:49,240 --> 02:10:51,540
I have many diamonds
left with me.

1635
02:10:52,500 --> 02:10:55,100
I have enough
money for 5-6 months.

1636
02:10:55,120 --> 02:10:57,120
I'll see later.
- Right.

1637
02:10:59,530 --> 02:11:02,230
I'll come downstairs,
it's time for my train.

1638
02:11:02,450 --> 02:11:03,950
Yes, sir.

1639
02:11:49,900 --> 02:11:52,800
Sorry, I touched
you by mistake.

1640
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:54,120
No problem.

1641
02:11:54,950 --> 02:11:57,880
You can make such beautiful
mistakes frequently.

1642
02:12:11,440 --> 02:12:12,560
What? - What?

1643
02:12:14,540 --> 02:12:17,740
Your voice sounds like..

1644
02:12:18,050 --> 02:12:19,940
...I've met you before.

1645
02:12:21,910 --> 02:12:24,630
But I can't recollect
where I've met you.

1646
02:12:24,700 --> 02:12:25,810
Can I tell you?

1647
02:12:26,400 --> 02:12:27,940
Where? - In your dreams.

1648
02:12:28,940 --> 02:12:31,460
Every man has a picture
in his heart..

1649
02:12:31,830 --> 02:12:33,230
...of the one
he loves the most.

1650
02:12:33,500 --> 02:12:35,760
Suddenly when that face
comes before him..

1651
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:39,490
...he feels that they know
each other for a long time.

1652
02:12:40,320 --> 02:12:41,720
But can't remember
their names.

1653
02:12:43,420 --> 02:12:46,760
My name is Priya.

1654
02:12:48,250 --> 02:12:49,650
My name is..

1655
02:13:10,870 --> 02:13:13,170
Ms. Priya.
- Just Priya.

1656
02:13:13,300 --> 02:13:15,910
Priya, we haven't
ordered food.

1657
02:13:16,260 --> 02:13:18,070
Let's go to
the refreshment room.

1658
02:13:18,550 --> 02:13:20,410
It'll get cold by
the time it gets here.

1659
02:13:21,410 --> 02:13:22,970
Sure. Come on! Come on!

1660
02:13:25,340 --> 02:13:27,710
Excuse me. We're going out,..

1661
02:13:28,230 --> 02:13:30,710
...take care of my luggage.
- My pleasure.

1662
02:13:31,010 --> 02:13:33,070
I'll take care of your
luggage. - Thank you.

1663
02:13:55,540 --> 02:13:56,830
Give sir some water, Pandu.

1664
02:13:58,810 --> 02:13:59,990
What will you eat, sir?

1665
02:14:00,200 --> 02:14:02,640
Mutton special, mutton fry,
mutton korma, mutton keema..

1666
02:14:02,700 --> 02:14:03,750
...or soda?

1667
02:14:04,100 --> 02:14:05,320
Let the lady order.

1668
02:14:06,320 --> 02:14:07,510
Correct? - Correct!

1669
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:17,950
This trip and
opportunity comes once.

1670
02:14:18,880 --> 02:14:21,920
Don't know when
we'll meet again.

1671
02:14:22,680 --> 02:14:25,530
If you help me,
we'll meet soon.

1672
02:14:31,790 --> 02:14:32,910
Is that our train?

1673
02:14:33,570 --> 02:14:36,530
There's plenty of
time for our train.

1674
02:14:37,040 --> 02:14:38,160
Eat your food.

1675
02:14:42,860 --> 02:14:45,370
Sir, you want to go by the
Calcutta express, right?

1676
02:14:45,710 --> 02:14:47,040
Your train is about to leave.

1677
02:15:02,550 --> 02:15:04,630
I told you we'll meet soon.

1678
02:15:05,820 --> 02:15:06,930
The police must be..

1679
02:15:14,650 --> 02:15:16,220
My heart's wish was..

1680
02:15:16,950 --> 02:15:24,610
...that I die in the arm
of my beloved Shyam.

1681
02:15:29,610 --> 02:15:33,380
But not as his beloved.
But as a criminal.

1682
02:15:33,690 --> 02:15:34,870
Till date I used to think..

1683
02:15:34,940 --> 02:15:37,270
...that you could never
understand me and my love.

1684
02:15:37,510 --> 02:15:40,120
But today I got to know
what a big fool I was.

1685
02:15:40,370 --> 02:15:42,150
I could not recognize you.

1686
02:15:42,770 --> 02:15:44,550
What can a criminal's
daughter..

1687
02:15:44,850 --> 02:15:47,050
...be other than
a criminal herself?

1688
02:16:04,160 --> 02:16:09,940
Yes, Shyam. I.. I have
played this dirty game.

1689
02:16:11,710 --> 02:16:16,900
I thought that you will
start hating Nita.

1690
02:16:17,490 --> 02:16:21,320
I wanted to have you.

1691
02:16:21,460 --> 02:16:24,140
But Nita..

1692
02:16:25,140 --> 02:16:26,960
...forgive me.

1693
02:16:31,160 --> 02:16:32,310
Lily!

1694
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:06,480
Tell me, what's your
true identity?

1695
02:21:13,390 --> 02:21:14,830
My name is Anokhelal.

1696
02:21:16,630 --> 02:21:21,920
I'm not the manager of Mehta
and Company and Hotels Hilltop.

1697
02:21:23,270 --> 02:21:24,460
I'm the owner.

1698
02:21:30,410 --> 02:21:32,330
I murdered..

1699
02:21:33,400 --> 02:21:36,440
...my elder brother
under greed.

1700
02:21:37,680 --> 02:21:40,010
They caught poor, innocent..

1701
02:21:46,130 --> 02:21:48,020
Poor, Ram Dev.

1702
02:21:57,230 --> 02:21:59,820
Inspector Shyam,
Congratulations!

1703
02:22:00,780 --> 02:22:02,210
You have increased
the department's..

1704
02:22:02,280 --> 02:22:03,840
...reputation by
catching the thugs.

1705
02:22:04,290 --> 02:22:05,370
I'm very happy.

1706
02:22:09,230 --> 02:22:10,670
Well, best of luck!

1707
02:22:13,900 --> 02:22:17,170
We can't forget your
debt for life.

1708
02:22:17,440 --> 02:22:21,380
Father, I have fulfilled
the promise I made to Nita.

1709
02:22:21,690 --> 02:22:24,550
Son, this is your
responsibility too.

1710
02:22:24,720 --> 02:22:26,750
Of course! Of course!
Why not!

1711
02:22:27,050 --> 02:22:29,040
Shyam, I'll better go now.

1712
02:22:29,410 --> 02:22:30,740
My train is about to leave.

1713
02:22:30,980 --> 02:22:34,290
I don't know till now,
what I should do in my life.

1714
02:22:34,600 --> 02:22:36,410
But I understand one thing..

1715
02:22:36,650 --> 02:22:39,430
Never to eat an orange from
an unknown woman's hands.

1716
02:22:39,560 --> 02:22:42,080
Neither do you! But you can!

1717
02:22:42,150 --> 02:22:43,300
Orange from Nagpur!

1718
02:22:43,920 --> 02:22:45,320
Take it. Take it.
OK, bye. Bye!

1719
02:22:45,520 --> 02:22:46,640
Bye! Bye!

1720
02:22:46,700 --> 02:22:51,200
<i>As soon as I saw
your beautiful eyes,</i>

1721
02:22:51,260 --> 02:22:55,580
<i>...my heart got influenced.</i>

1722
02:22:55,650 --> 02:22:59,820
<i>Please take care of me,
my friends.</i>
