00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:44,065
CHEMMANNOOR

2
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:52,478
Long live revolution.
Long live revolution.

3
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:55,648
Long live revolution.
Long live revolution.

4
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:58,818
Long live communist party.
Long live communist party.

5
00:01:59,018 --> 00:02:07,483
Long live communist party.
Long live communist party.

6
00:02:12,765 --> 00:02:22,731
[Skipped item nr. 6]

7
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:37,784
This is comrade Mukundan.

8
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:42,026
Since he became a leader
of the Party in Chemmannur...

9
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:52,697
...and conducted many such small and big...
...protests he got many such beatings.

10
00:02:53,406 --> 00:02:58,867
Mukundan's political life starts from his
high school days... and not now.

11
00:02:59,078 --> 00:03:04,380
In all the protests of the students, Mukundan
was their young leader, and grew up thus.

12
00:03:05,084 --> 00:03:09,384
When he became an adult Mukundan was
known in all communist circles.

13
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:14,887
He was a worshipper of Fidel Castro.
Cuba was like his mother country.

14
00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:18,162
So he got his nick name
as Cuba Mukundan.

15
00:03:20,433 --> 00:03:21,730
This is comrade Anwar.

16
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:25,232
If Mukundan is fire
then Anwar was a torch.

17
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:28,407
Just like Mukundan,
Anwar too was an atheist.

18
00:03:28,608 --> 00:03:33,068
And if at all there was a God that was
the Party & his comrade Mukundan.

19
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:35,577
Long live communist Party.
Long live communist Party.

20
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:39,183
This strike was against
contractor cum owner...

21
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:42,912
...Kunjunni's leather factory,
and their decision was not...

22
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:47,248
...to allow the factory to function without getting
permission from the environment people.

23
00:03:51,798 --> 00:03:54,062
The protestors were all beaten up,
and the main protestors...

24
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:56,235
...are arrested by the police
and taken away.

25
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:59,097
The owner of the leather Factory, Kunjunni...

26
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:05,108
...was a smart man to get his work done
which ever party comes to power.

27
00:04:05,478 --> 00:04:07,446
He has roots even in the Gulf.

28
00:04:09,482 --> 00:04:13,942
Gopala, the comrades who were protesting at
the factory were beaten up & arrested by the police.

29
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,947
I got the information Raghavan sir.

30
00:04:16,155 --> 00:04:18,282
I heard that about 5-10 of them
are seriously injured.

31
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:20,119
Mukundan are also in hospital.

32
00:04:20,727 --> 00:04:22,024
I heard that too.

33
00:04:22,228 --> 00:04:26,562
Since the protest are lead by Mukudan, the
police must have beaten him up a little more.

34
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,968
I am very proud of him.

35
00:04:29,168 --> 00:04:32,729
He went on strike, got beaten up and is in
hospital for fighting for a good cause.

36
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:33,633
You sit down.

37
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:34,965
George.
- What?

38
00:04:35,174 --> 00:04:36,141
Get some tea for him.
- Yes.

39
00:04:36,342 --> 00:04:36,808
Sit down.

40
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:41,379
This is Mukundan's father Society Gopalan.
Brother Gopalan for the people.

41
00:04:42,081 --> 00:04:45,812
He is proud to be born poor
and live as a poor man.

42
00:04:46,185 --> 00:04:48,312
He was one of the founder
members of the party

43
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:50,819
and has a major share in the
making grass root level workers.

44
00:04:55,194 --> 00:04:58,823
This is comrade, Karunan.
A practical Politician.

45
00:04:59,032 --> 00:05:02,263
A new face. One of the brains
in the Party.

46
00:05:02,935 --> 00:05:08,999
In his speeches you will hear, compromise...
...cut them down etc words too.

47
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:14,005
His main motto is don't look down
when climbing up.

48
00:05:15,214 --> 00:05:18,843
As I had on some party media work,
I could not reach in time for the Dharna.

49
00:05:20,386 --> 00:05:24,186
Mukundan, getting always involved in such
beatings. Where it's going to end?

50
00:05:25,558 --> 00:05:28,527
The people of this state and the party...
...wants Mukundan alive.

51
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:29,695
Hence this should not
repeat again.

52
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:32,364
We've to do some thing for that?
- What to do?

53
00:05:33,132 --> 00:05:34,360
Let us get out from the hospital...

54
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:37,369
...we will burn the factory of the man
who set the... police on us.

55
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:41,529
Anwar, that is not a practical step.
Kunjunni has come from, Dubai.

56
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:45,541
We have to reach an amicable solution
without any loss of face for the party.

57
00:05:45,978 --> 00:05:47,878
Wasn't it a decision taken
by the whole party.

58
00:05:48,414 --> 00:05:50,882
Then why this language
of compromise now?

59
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,718
We can't let our party
people get killed.

60
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:58,115
If possible negotiate it peacefully is the
decision of the managing committee.

61
00:05:58,591 --> 00:06:01,719
Any way, as soon as you guys get out
from here we all will go see him.

62
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:03,725
We will try and see,
what do you say?

63
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:06,398
Let us get well,
then we will decide.

64
00:06:10,269 --> 00:06:11,736
Oh! Come in. Come in.

65
00:06:14,941 --> 00:06:16,806
It is just a minute before I arrived.

66
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:18,238
Please sit down.

67
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:24,811
Mukundan, should not
misunderstand me.

68
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:29,748
I had only told the police to remove the
protestors from the Factory premises.

69
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:33,188
But I never expected them
to use baton Charge etc.

70
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:38,829
You did not have the brains to know that
if people are unwilling to move, then...

71
00:06:39,031 --> 00:06:42,432
...the police will use force and
then it will turn violent?

72
00:06:42,635 --> 00:06:45,195
Hey let it go.
Isn't it all past Mukundan?

73
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,430
Since comrade did not get beaten up...
...you think like that.

74
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:49,942
We have not come here...
...to discuss any compromise.

75
00:06:50,476 --> 00:06:52,376
We came to tell you the
situation plainly in person.

76
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:57,946
Many wells around the
factory are polluted.

77
00:06:58,317 --> 00:07:01,844
The factory will not work for even a day
without finding a solution for this pollution.

78
00:07:02,221 --> 00:07:05,054
I have agreed that I will do it, isn't it?
But it will take time.

79
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:08,852
And till then the loss I will
face if I shut the factory...

80
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:12,620
Let us do one thing.
10 people whom Mukundan...

81
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:15,629
...will decide, comrades are jobless isn't it...
...I will give them job in my factory.

82
00:07:16,002 --> 00:07:20,462
Bribing the party. Mister this protest
is against social evil.

83
00:07:20,673 --> 00:07:22,140
Not against unemployment.

84
00:07:22,341 --> 00:07:24,741
Isn't it a good thing that our
people get a job, Mukundan?

85
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:26,309
Comrade should not talk like that.

86
00:07:26,679 --> 00:07:33,983
No. I... we make the strike a success.
But without much loss for both sides.

87
00:07:34,353 --> 00:07:36,150
Isn't that called a compromise?

88
00:07:37,356 --> 00:07:39,824
Many memoranda have gone
to the government.

89
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:44,493
There is no question of allowing anything...
...that affects the lives of people living here.

90
00:07:47,533 --> 00:07:48,898
There is only one compromise.

91
00:07:49,101 --> 00:07:51,501
Set up the plant for treatment of the
polluted water at your earliest.

92
00:07:51,704 --> 00:07:53,672
Till then shut the factory.
We will see.

93
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:56,332
Hey, Mukundan.

94
00:07:57,376 --> 00:07:58,001
Mukundan.

95
00:07:59,912 --> 00:08:03,575
Do these beggars have any idea that
the treatment plant costs?

96
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:05,848
What did you say?
To make the strike a success?

97
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:07,952
In publicaly...

98
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:10,349
You must have the courage
to oppose... it publicaly.

99
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:16,026
The day when you stop fearing such guys,
that day you & your party will be saved.

100
00:08:16,562 --> 00:08:19,122
To make such people grow...
...in stature is dangerous.

101
00:08:19,565 --> 00:08:23,695
I heard that this rascal will be
candidate for the next election.

102
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,866
You just comb your hair...
...place that specs on and walk like this.

103
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:30,540
If you don't do anything before the mud is
eroded away from below your feet...

104
00:08:30,743 --> 00:08:31,710
...then you won't be anywhere.

105
00:08:33,746 --> 00:08:37,614
If I do anything in a haste
it will a political mistake.

106
00:08:38,751 --> 00:08:40,946
Get him when I get a chance.

107
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:44,213
The chance will come, Mr. Kunjunni.

108
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:51,628
Dad, I going out.
- Wait I am coming too.

109
00:08:57,770 --> 00:08:59,067
Where are you going so early
in the morning?

110
00:08:59,505 --> 00:09:01,234
There is a cutting of plants in Melkavu.

111
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:04,739
Oh! What plant are you cutting off?

112
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:07,242
They have planted plantain
trees in paddy fields.

113
00:09:07,446 --> 00:09:08,970
We will cut off all the plantain plants.

114
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:10,910
Even plantains are a part
of agriculture, Mukundan.

115
00:09:11,117 --> 00:09:13,813
It may be. But you can't
make rice with plantains.

116
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,422
Dosa, Puttu, Idli, and rice...

117
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:22,423
For all these basic food of Malayalees...
we need rice only.

118
00:09:22,628 --> 00:09:24,323
If you stop planting rice...
...where will we go for rice?

119
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:28,862
Does dad say we wait open mouthed for
rice laden trucks to come from Andhra?

120
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:29,762
I did not say so.

121
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:33,769
Then let's do this. This cutting is
party decision. We have to do this.

122
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:39,602
Mukundan, that E.P. Gopi was a party member...
...isn't it? I heard that he was suspended.

123
00:09:39,812 --> 00:09:41,609
Yes. Dad doesn't know the reason?
- No.

124
00:09:41,814 --> 00:09:43,111
He was not simply suspended.

125
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:46,285
The party got a report that
he secretly drinks liquor.

126
00:09:46,485 --> 00:09:49,113
If a party leader who has to be a role
model for others does like this,

127
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:51,688
not only suspension he may
even be dismissed.

128
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:53,950
If you see like that then you may have
to dismiss many such people.

129
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,287
If many people drink
we will dismiss many.

130
00:09:57,496 --> 00:09:59,123
When Communist Party
ruled Russia...

131
00:09:59,498 --> 00:10:01,466
...there were very few of them
who did not drink Vodka.

132
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:04,465
Yes the Communism in Russia broke up...
...as they went on drinking Vodka.

133
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:09,132
Dad should remember one thing.
After the party's revival, i.e. After 1964...

134
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,304
...we don't recognize Russia.

135
00:10:11,677 --> 00:10:16,137
Yes, before 64, we recognized leaders...
...who drank Vodka.

136
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:19,318
That is because the party
was mistaken.

137
00:10:19,518 --> 00:10:22,976
When a mistake is made, the party corrects it...
...even after 30 or 40 years, isn't it?

138
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:25,316
Yes, that is correct.
If that is so...

139
00:10:25,524 --> 00:10:29,153
...if you realize that today's
cutting of plantain trees...

140
00:10:29,528 --> 00:10:31,996
...was a mistake then will you the same cutters
will plant these plantain trees and give?

141
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:36,066
Now Vodka, cutting plantain trees...
...are two different topics. - I see.

142
00:10:36,268 --> 00:10:40,329
We do have some doubting masters like dad
in the party too. Old age is the reason.

143
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:44,276
I don't have any doubt about
the Party principle.

144
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:47,344
Very good thing.
I won't say much.

145
00:10:47,546 --> 00:10:50,276
Some times you may suspend saying...

146
00:10:50,883 --> 00:10:53,181
...I am an anti party.
Yes, in party work there is no dad and son.

147
00:10:53,552 --> 00:10:56,851
Yes I know that.
I don't know why...

148
00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:01,520
I feel like saying this,
which I did not feel before.

149
00:11:02,728 --> 00:11:08,030
I know it is past the age.
Yet you get married.

150
00:11:08,734 --> 00:11:11,532
Marriage? Dad, I don't want to marry.
It won't work. - Why?

151
00:11:11,737 --> 00:11:13,534
I too thought of this topic.

152
00:11:14,073 --> 00:11:18,874
Even if I marry a... grass root level
worker from the party...

153
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:22,045
...when she becomes a wife, she will turn...
...into an ordinary Malayalee woman.

154
00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:24,713
She will go to one side with
house, husband and kids.

155
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:28,717
If I go beyond that then she will start...
...dominating the husband.

156
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:31,888
Only such things occurs in our country...
...and with our women.

157
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:36,221
Only if it was China, or Cuba what deep
understanding the women there have?

158
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:39,398
Oh! It is not so easy
to go there and marry.

159
00:11:39,765 --> 00:11:41,232
Mukundan, I say this seriously...

160
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:45,234
...I don't know how long I will be alive now.
- My thing too is somewhat similar.

161
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:47,804
Who knows when the police
will beat and kill me?

162
00:11:48,107 --> 00:11:51,406
Dad, marriage is an obstacle
to party affairs.

163
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:52,803
You don't say such things.

164
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:55,411
If that is so, then how did Marx marry?

165
00:11:55,614 --> 00:11:58,412
I have read somewhere that
he regretted that later on.

166
00:11:58,617 --> 00:12:01,586
I have not read that anywhere.
Even if that was correct, do one thing.

167
00:12:01,854 --> 00:12:05,085
Now you get married.
Then after some time leave her.

168
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:07,684
Mukundan.

169
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:11,088
Who? Abbas? When did come from Dubai?
- I came yesterday.

170
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:13,758
You came yesterday and
where are you till now?

171
00:12:13,966 --> 00:12:15,263
Had to deliver a few letters.

172
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,763
I considered the annual day of
youth federation... and took leave.

173
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:21,201
This time we have to do it well.
I will bear the expense for that.

174
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,608
The party has not come
that such situation...

175
00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:26,277
...that we should do the annual day
with the money of the bourgeois.

176
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:27,946
Why did you say so, Mukundan?

177
00:12:28,547 --> 00:12:30,606
I left this place as I could not
bear the loans... I had on me.

178
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:33,942
Even though in Dubai am I not...
...worker who makes his blood run like water?

179
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:36,848
The point here is for whom
you are working.

180
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:41,950
To increase the finances of multinational
companies, the blood you convert to water...

181
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:43,958
you should make it in
Chemmannor, isn't it?

182
00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:46,723
Where ever one worker works...
...he should get his wages, isn't it?

183
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:51,301
When I spill the same blood in Dubai that I spill here
I get twelve times the amount I get here.

184
00:12:51,837 --> 00:12:53,896
That instead of burying that...
...I send it here every month isn't it?

185
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:55,130
Only with that it is not over.

186
00:12:55,508 --> 00:12:57,635
Hey, Mukundan why you
argue with, Abbas?

187
00:12:57,843 --> 00:12:59,868
Since he went to,
Dubai he won't become bourgeois.

188
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:01,546
I was only testing him.

189
00:13:01,747 --> 00:13:03,408
His old fervor has not reduced so far.

190
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:06,550
Mukundan, Mukundan,

191
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,147
lawyer Ramakrishnan...
called from Trivandrum.

192
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:13,825
The government has... ordered for the
shutting of the factory. -ls it true?

193
00:13:14,026 --> 00:13:16,654
Hey.

194
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:22,831
Long live revolution.
Long live revolution.

195
00:13:23,035 --> 00:13:28,996
Locked it. Locked it.
We got the factory locked.

196
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:32,511
Long live revolution.
Long live revolution.

197
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:44,686
"You are the flowering tree from
the soil where..."...blood was spilt."

198
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:49,350
"A nation in which many
such flowers bloomed."

199
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:54,022
"See my comrades,
on the street that we came in..."

200
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:58,192
"...see the words written
in the blood of many."

201
00:13:58,404 --> 00:14:06,209
"Revolution, red salutes."

202
00:14:07,913 --> 00:14:12,213
"The arms used in this war
are not sharp arms."

203
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:16,718
"It is a battle field where
things are fought..."

204
00:14:16,922 --> 00:14:21,291
"...we should see that our
revolutionary ideas don't die"

205
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:26,226
"With victory we should do away
with the darkness."

206
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:35,072
"The ideas we planted
and reared so long..."

207
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:39,574
"...the history says that they
are harvested and looted."

208
00:14:39,778 --> 00:14:44,238
"Many crores of people gave
their lives to prevent."

209
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:48,910
"...fought and won over
the relief for people."

210
00:15:02,134 --> 00:15:03,101
Fire.

211
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:11,766
"The stirring words which
opens up our country..."

212
00:15:11,977 --> 00:15:16,437
"...it all comes back as
question in our lives."

213
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:25,455
"The hearts that witnessed such killings."

214
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:29,788
"...were shattered with tears drying up."

215
00:15:29,995 --> 00:15:37,959
"Red salutes. Red salutes."

216
00:15:39,338 --> 00:15:43,638
"Remember that we have
a long way to go."

217
00:15:43,842 --> 00:15:48,302
"Be careful that one does
not go astray on the way."

218
00:15:48,514 --> 00:15:52,814
"You should concentrate
on the aim all the time."

219
00:15:53,018 --> 00:15:57,648
"You should succeed without
failing on the way."

220
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:06,492
"Not thinking of tomorrow
today itself we should do it."

221
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:11,068
"We should write unforgettable
stories on the way."

222
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:15,673
"The idea of equality will
never die in this world."

223
00:16:15,874 --> 00:16:20,174
"We have only one dream,
then now and for ever."

224
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:24,679
"The idea of equality will
never die in this world."

225
00:16:24,883 --> 00:16:29,183
"We have only one dream,

226
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:34,518
then now and for ever."

227
00:16:34,893 --> 00:16:40,024
Brother Gopalan. Hey hold him. Hold him.
- Get some water. Soon.

228
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:14,895
What is the matter?

229
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,498
Manager Krishnan has come
from the co-op. Bank.

230
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:19,569
To see dad? Let him see him.

231
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:21,899
Hey, not that. To say something else.

232
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:28,310
How is your dad?

233
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:29,639
He is in the same state.

234
00:17:31,283 --> 00:17:31,908
What is the matter?

235
00:17:32,117 --> 00:17:35,985
I don't know whether I should
this at this time.

236
00:17:36,955 --> 00:17:39,082
Though the society and the
bank is of the party...

237
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:42,924
...as a manager in the bank
I have some responsibility.

238
00:17:44,129 --> 00:17:48,589
When he became conscious did he...
...say about anything else?

239
00:17:48,967 --> 00:17:49,695
What matter?

240
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:53,836
Is it not the money taken from the money got
by selling paddy from the rice mill.

241
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:55,707
Who took the money?

242
00:17:56,141 --> 00:18:00,100
For some urgent need of the society brother,
Gopalan had taken 20 lakhs.

243
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:01,710
For society's urgent need?

244
00:18:02,147 --> 00:18:03,842
Such an urgent has not come till now.

245
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:07,283
I have seen the accounts till yesterday.
- I don't know that.

246
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:09,781
There is a proof of withdrawal from
the bank... in the bank.

247
00:18:11,223 --> 00:18:13,691
If it was not used for the
society's need then...

248
00:18:13,892 --> 00:18:15,519
...what did brother Gopalan
do with that money?

249
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,620
Did he say anything about
this to Mukundan?

250
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:19,855
I don't know anything.

251
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:23,963
It has become a problem isn't it?

252
00:18:24,837 --> 00:18:28,295
This was an unexpected
even in the party.

253
00:18:28,907 --> 00:18:32,968
Gopalan, who was a role model in the party
what did he do with this amount?

254
00:18:33,178 --> 00:18:34,805
Discussions and enquiries
took place.

255
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:40,074
At the end the party took a decision
to take a severe action on Gopalan.

256
00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:42,645
This is very tragic matter.

257
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:44,322
Who is this Society Gopalan?

258
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:47,317
At a time when the British flags
were flying...

259
00:18:47,526 --> 00:18:50,222
...a man who fought for the
party without fear.

260
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:52,991
Truly he is founder of the
party in Chemmannoor.

261
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:58,767
The man who founded the society the man
who made the base of the party here...

262
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,598
and today the same party
wants to rusticate him?

263
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:03,741
That too when Gopalan, is in a
helpless state lying in a hospital.

264
00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:06,677
In the enquiry conducted by the commission
which the party appointed,

265
00:19:07,045 --> 00:19:09,843
that amount was not spent for the
sake of the society. - Yes.

266
00:19:10,048 --> 00:19:14,178
Then does it not mean that Society
Gopalan has misused that amount? - Yes.

267
00:19:14,386 --> 00:19:17,014
Then why do we try to white wash him?

268
00:19:17,556 --> 00:19:20,184
If some one else pays this amount
on behalf of Gopalan,

269
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,459
then can't we avoid the action
of suspension, isn't it?

270
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:26,188
Does not the party have the responsibility
of saving a true leader of the party?

271
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:28,363
When this is known outside what will
happen to the image of the party?

272
00:19:29,067 --> 00:19:30,694
The party's image will shine still better.

273
00:19:31,236 --> 00:19:35,696
Whoever does the mistake will get punished
is the message that will reach the people.

274
00:19:36,074 --> 00:19:38,042
Who will pay the amount in
the bank you are saying?

275
00:19:38,243 --> 00:19:41,041
We can talk about that after
stopping the suspension action.

276
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:43,242
May be if the Kunjunni
owner helps us out?

277
00:19:43,749 --> 00:19:46,718
But we may have to compromise
a little in the factory matter.

278
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:48,716
That will not happen for any reason.

279
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:53,485
As a secretary the responsibility
for punishing is mine.

280
00:19:54,092 --> 00:19:57,493
As his son I take the responsibility of taking
that amount as a loan repayment.

281
00:19:57,696 --> 00:20:00,290
Mukundan, is it an amount
that you can take on you?

282
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:01,891
I have to take it.

283
00:20:03,435 --> 00:20:06,893
But till I repay the amount...
...the party should give me leave.

284
00:20:07,606 --> 00:20:10,302
You should get me some time too
from the bank... for the repayment.

285
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:12,238
If that is so, then why dismiss, Gopalan?

286
00:20:13,011 --> 00:20:14,911
We were together since childhood.

287
00:20:15,614 --> 00:20:18,310
No one knows, Gopalan as much
as I know him.

288
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:21,078
I won't agree to the decision
of his suspension.

289
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:24,085
That is a personal opinion of Rama Unni.

290
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,086
This is the party's decision.

291
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:29,922
Diwakaran, read the verdict.

292
00:20:35,467 --> 00:20:36,934
Comrades, as per the decision given by the...

293
00:20:37,135 --> 00:20:41,936
enquiry committee which looked into matter
has recommended that Gopalan be suspended...

294
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:44,108
from the party's primary membership.

295
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:48,439
Mukundan, brother Gopalan passed away.

296
00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:02,722
If you don't know that your party has
CID work even then I know it.

297
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:05,196
Hence I told you not
to tell on the phone.

298
00:21:05,397 --> 00:21:07,297
I had gone to Gopalan's funeral. - Ok.

299
00:21:07,499 --> 00:21:11,799
In a way, his sickness and subsequent death
made it advantageous for us, isn't it?

300
00:21:12,904 --> 00:21:15,634
Tell me, how did you make it stick?

301
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:20,536
When he took an amount as
a loan for the society...

302
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:25,809
a blank cheque was taken as security
duly signed by him, and I had kept it safely.

303
00:21:26,518 --> 00:21:29,885
I wrote twenty lakhs in that
and withdrew the money.

304
00:21:30,689 --> 00:21:33,157
If found out it is a case
where I will go inside.

305
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:36,828
But I am confident that you
two won't leave me in lurch

306
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:43,161
Will we leave you to suffer who made the guy
who got me trapped, caught in this?

307
00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:45,497
Then what next in this matter?

308
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:50,908
Go with dignity, some things are still in heart.
I will let you know the rest.

309
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:53,668
I have to basically go to Trivandrum?
- For whom?

310
00:21:53,879 --> 00:21:57,337
There state committee is going on there.
I will go there and call. - Ok, sir.

311
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:19,201
What Mukundan, this is?
You are sitting here?

312
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:21,703
I was to come to the junction
in the evening.

313
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,607
From tomorrow I am opening
the tea shop.

314
00:22:24,309 --> 00:22:26,709
Last few days we were thinking about you.

315
00:22:27,145 --> 00:22:28,874
Is it a small load that you have taken up?

316
00:22:29,748 --> 00:22:31,477
It is a load of 20 lakhs.

317
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:35,310
How long will it take to repay the 20 lakhs
loan if you sell tea and Dhal Wada?

318
00:22:35,587 --> 00:22:36,611
Is it practical?

319
00:22:36,988 --> 00:22:38,546
I do not know any other work.

320
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:41,883
Or I will have to go climb
coconut trees or go fishing.

321
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:45,557
If you climb coconut trees you will get scars
but won't make so much money.

322
00:22:45,764 --> 00:22:48,164
We thought it from all the angles.

323
00:22:48,433 --> 00:22:50,901
Even the district committee has
doubts in your case.

324
00:22:51,269 --> 00:22:54,500
If Mukundan is not be able to repay the
loan isn't it a black spot on the party?

325
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:57,740
Hence we all got together
and have reached a decision.

326
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,074
What decision?

327
00:23:04,449 --> 00:23:07,748
Anyway Mukundan, has taken the decision to
take leave from the party isn't it?

328
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:14,252
That time, meaning, 2 or 3 years
why don't you go to, Dubai and work? - What?

329
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:21,332
Kumaran, who was selling iced sweets
daily worker, Vasu, Carpenter Balan...

330
00:23:22,033 --> 00:23:24,194
many such people went to Gulf
and became rich.

331
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:26,769
Is the party's decision
to make me rich?

332
00:23:27,706 --> 00:23:30,539
If the loan amount is in lakhs...
...lakhs are needed for repaying it.

333
00:23:31,042 --> 00:23:33,533
If anyone else wants to help...
...Mukundan does not agree.

334
00:23:33,979 --> 00:23:38,109
Don't even dream that you will run
the tea shop and repay the loan.

335
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:40,278
When you say Dubai...

336
00:23:40,719 --> 00:23:42,949
If needed I will go either
to Cuba or China.

337
00:23:43,321 --> 00:23:45,221
Cuba and China are communist countries...

338
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:47,949
but they don't have any law
to offer a job to a foreigner.

339
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,559
Even so if you do get a job...

340
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:52,127
Cuba and China don't have the
capacity handsome salaries.

341
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:53,695
Who said so? Fidel Castro...

342
00:23:53,899 --> 00:23:59,633
Since he was permanently against the U. S
the situation there is very bad.

343
00:24:00,338 --> 00:24:02,306
We all thought it over well
and then came here.

344
00:24:02,674 --> 00:24:04,642
Karunan's brother-in-law Sidharthan
is in Dubai.

345
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:07,470
There is no problem to get
a visa through him.

346
00:24:09,748 --> 00:24:14,811
The District committee says a leader
like Mukundan is needed in Dubai.

347
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:18,088
Isn't it a place where thousands
of Malayalees are working isn't it?

348
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:20,656
They have problems.
But they are not organized.

349
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:25,726
The District committee thinks that you can
solve most of their problems.

350
00:24:26,531 --> 00:24:29,500
There are even talks about giving
voting rights to the expats there.

351
00:24:29,701 --> 00:24:33,159
Hence we should get them to our
ways as early as possible.

352
00:24:33,371 --> 00:24:34,497
Mukundan, need not know anything.

353
00:24:34,773 --> 00:24:36,070
We will take care of everything.

354
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:38,503
Just prepare mentally to go to, Dubai.

355
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:40,007
That is all Mukundan has to do.

356
00:24:46,117 --> 00:24:47,175
The bus is coming.

357
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:57,526
Don't be troubled.
Just think of it as a place change.

358
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:02,364
Marx has said that there is only thing that
does not change that is change itself.

359
00:25:03,101 --> 00:25:04,864
Though it is for repayment of loan...

360
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:07,971
I am going there to solve the worker's
problems over there isn't it?

361
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:26,389
Get in. Get in.
Ok, you can go. Right.

362
00:25:27,425 --> 00:25:28,392
Red salute.

363
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:43,404
Our good wishes. Our good wishes.
Our good wishes. Thousands of good wishes

364
00:26:15,941 --> 00:26:18,000
Isn't this first time you are
coming to, Dubai?

365
00:26:18,276 --> 00:26:23,475
Yes. My only solace was
that Sidharthan is here.

366
00:26:24,549 --> 00:26:27,484
How is it here?
The party is functioning well here isn't it?

367
00:26:29,788 --> 00:26:33,588
I know that I should not ask such a question
my comrade's brother-in-law.

368
00:26:34,292 --> 00:26:36,089
How long it is since Sidharthan is here?

369
00:26:36,294 --> 00:26:37,158
About 5 years.

370
00:26:37,996 --> 00:26:41,090
What does Mukundan expect
when you say party functioning etc.

371
00:26:41,466 --> 00:26:42,831
What I mean by it is as yourself...

372
00:26:43,034 --> 00:26:47,937
your comrades too are ensured
leading a good life as yourself...

373
00:26:48,206 --> 00:26:52,700
To do away with bourgeois powers
that try to exploit them.

374
00:26:52,911 --> 00:26:55,379
All those things are included
in the laws of this government.

375
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:56,376
It may be.

376
00:26:56,748 --> 00:27:00,377
Yet I heard that there are
many Capitalist here.

377
00:27:01,219 --> 00:27:04,711
To tell you the truth I wanted
to go to China or Cuba.

378
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:07,456
Then Cuba would have improved. Cuba.

379
00:27:11,496 --> 00:27:16,798
Mukundan, see this tunnel,
it is about 1.5 km long.

380
00:27:17,168 --> 00:27:19,534
Is there such a tunnel in Cuba
which you said?

381
00:27:23,508 --> 00:27:26,068
See the sky scrapers standing.

382
00:27:26,277 --> 00:27:28,802
Will the whole Cuba will come
to one such building?

383
00:27:29,014 --> 00:27:32,814
Siddhartha. We ourselves should
not talk lowly about Cuba.

384
00:27:33,118 --> 00:27:33,812
Then one more thing...

385
00:27:34,285 --> 00:27:37,652
Fidel Castro has never said
that the tall building...

386
00:27:37,922 --> 00:27:39,651
...in a country determines the
growth of that country.

387
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:43,658
I see. So that is how you got the
name as Cuba Mukundan.

388
00:27:45,797 --> 00:27:50,097
So you have come for party functioning,
or to repay the loan of your dad?

389
00:27:50,535 --> 00:27:52,002
My intention is both.

390
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:57,505
I have to study the worker's problems
and report them all in time. Yes.

391
00:28:00,378 --> 00:28:10,913
God is Great.

392
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:15,923
There will be many things that
Mukundan doesn't like.

393
00:28:16,394 --> 00:28:19,454
So don't organize some strike and become
an enemy of the government here.

394
00:28:19,831 --> 00:28:21,355
That I will never do Siddhartha.

395
00:28:21,966 --> 00:28:23,934
This place has provided jobs
to many Keralites...

396
00:28:24,135 --> 00:28:27,866
who were hungry, and jobless
over there, isn't it?

397
00:28:28,139 --> 00:28:29,470
Can we forget that?

398
00:28:29,674 --> 00:28:30,868
Oh! So you know all that, isn't it?

399
00:28:31,076 --> 00:28:34,477
Sure. But are workers being exploited.

400
00:28:34,946 --> 00:28:37,471
Do they getjustice? That I will enquire.

401
00:28:37,682 --> 00:28:39,445
Will you get time for all that after work?

402
00:28:39,818 --> 00:28:41,445
Time of work is 8 hours isn't it?
- Yes.

403
00:28:41,686 --> 00:28:44,951
Just 4 more hours after that.
Still there are 12 more hours.

404
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:48,721
Let that be. What will be
the nature of my job?

405
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:50,158
Now I can't say that.

406
00:28:50,361 --> 00:28:53,888
But if you don't do yourjob properly then the
nature of those who make you work will change.

407
00:29:09,614 --> 00:29:10,308
Here hold it.

408
00:29:10,949 --> 00:29:13,918
Hey, why did you get it here?
If you kept it in the room it will be ok.

409
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:15,746
No. It is always convenient
to carry it with you.

410
00:29:15,954 --> 00:29:18,650
Not only that, you will actually see all the
problems of the workers yourself and study.

411
00:29:18,857 --> 00:29:21,655
And the pen paper file etc to make
the report is all in this bag, isn't it?

412
00:29:22,127 --> 00:29:23,094
Hey do it soon.

413
00:29:24,896 --> 00:29:27,023
Hey, Greetings.
- Greetings.

414
00:29:34,973 --> 00:29:36,941
Are you a Malayalee?
- What?

415
00:29:37,475 --> 00:29:38,772
He is a Pakistani.

416
00:29:39,978 --> 00:29:41,275
Here Mukundan, will work here.

417
00:29:42,046 --> 00:29:44,776
Here?
- Yes. At present here.

418
00:29:45,316 --> 00:29:48,012
In fact Mukundan, you are man from a
Labor Supply Company.

419
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:52,312
That is when a Company doesn't have
enough workers on its own...

420
00:29:52,557 --> 00:29:55,617
the Labor supply company
supplies its men on hire.

421
00:29:55,827 --> 00:29:57,886
On hire? Men?
- Yes.

422
00:29:58,496 --> 00:30:01,624
If you work here today, next week
you may work at some other place.

423
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:04,232
Hence you can study in details the
various problems that workers...

424
00:30:04,602 --> 00:30:06,627
come across in many types of
companies in much detail.

425
00:30:06,838 --> 00:30:09,306
What will be the nature of my job?

426
00:30:09,707 --> 00:30:10,901
That you will know immediately.

427
00:30:11,109 --> 00:30:12,633
You just go with him you will know.
I am going.

428
00:30:12,844 --> 00:30:17,907
Hey if you go like that, then how will
I reach my room in the evening?

429
00:30:18,449 --> 00:30:20,144
The company will give you
a place to stay.

430
00:30:20,351 --> 00:30:22,148
It also provides the transport
to reach there.

431
00:30:22,353 --> 00:30:23,320
I have arranged for all that.

432
00:30:23,521 --> 00:30:24,920
Won't that be a bother for the company?

433
00:30:25,123 --> 00:30:26,818
Not at all. The company won't
be troubled at all.

434
00:30:27,025 --> 00:30:28,822
The company has a very broad heart.

435
00:30:29,694 --> 00:30:30,661
Ok, sir.
- Ok, sir.

436
00:30:31,196 --> 00:30:33,391
Siddha...
- Red Salute.

437
00:30:35,366 --> 00:30:36,162
Come on.

438
00:30:38,203 --> 00:30:41,502
Either you take or don't. You can go.

439
00:30:49,714 --> 00:30:52,512
Wear this and come.
Wear this and come.

440
00:31:08,132 --> 00:31:09,360
Keep your things there.

441
00:31:09,901 --> 00:31:11,368
What?
- Hey keep it there.

442
00:31:11,903 --> 00:31:13,700
Hey told you to keep the bag there.
- I see.

443
00:31:16,474 --> 00:31:18,032
Go and work.
- What?

444
00:31:18,243 --> 00:31:19,540
Go and work.

445
00:31:20,745 --> 00:31:23,043
Keep those things on his head.
- Yes sir.

446
00:31:31,589 --> 00:31:34,387
Go behind. Go behind.
Go behind.

447
00:31:45,603 --> 00:31:48,401
Hey, Malbari, here, here. Bring it up.

448
00:32:25,076 --> 00:32:25,940
Load up.

449
00:32:46,764 --> 00:32:48,789
Are you a Malayalee?
- What?

450
00:32:58,843 --> 00:33:00,970
Are you a Malayalee?
- Yes.

451
00:33:01,846 --> 00:33:04,974
What is the problem?
- Name?

452
00:33:06,284 --> 00:33:06,978
Aravindan.

453
00:33:07,185 --> 00:33:08,413
From which place of Kerala are you?

454
00:33:09,354 --> 00:33:10,651
Chenganoor. What for?

455
00:33:11,456 --> 00:33:13,151
How long are you in this company?

456
00:33:14,425 --> 00:33:16,325
About 5 years, what do you want?

457
00:33:16,527 --> 00:33:19,655
Are you satisfied with
facilities provided here?

458
00:33:19,864 --> 00:33:20,489
If we are not then?

459
00:33:21,099 --> 00:33:24,330
If you are not then you have to
tell me why you are not satisfied.

460
00:33:24,535 --> 00:33:26,435
What if we tell you?
- I will find a solution.

461
00:33:26,637 --> 00:33:27,501
Who? You?

462
00:33:28,373 --> 00:33:30,841
If you want to know everything
you can go and ask there.

463
00:33:38,149 --> 00:33:39,514
Put this on his head.

464
00:33:48,459 --> 00:33:49,187
Go.

465
00:33:50,661 --> 00:33:52,026
Work Shirker.

466
00:33:57,235 --> 00:33:58,600
Hold it. Oh!

467
00:34:17,422 --> 00:34:20,220
Still there is half an hour more for
today's work to get over isn't it?

468
00:34:20,425 --> 00:34:23,952
What? There are 4.5 hours
for today's work to finish.

469
00:34:25,163 --> 00:34:29,725
Then the work timings over here
is not eight hours? - Eight hours?

470
00:34:30,701 --> 00:34:34,068
This is very bad isn't it?
Is there no one to question?

471
00:34:34,272 --> 00:34:36,832
Who is the Union Secretary over here?
- Union?

472
00:34:37,341 --> 00:34:38,399
There he comes.

473
00:34:38,776 --> 00:34:42,303
He is the Union Secretary, Treasurer,
President all in one here.

474
00:34:42,513 --> 00:34:43,912
Just tell him.

475
00:35:20,384 --> 00:35:21,544
I want to go to toilet.

476
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:41,564
Long live revolution.
Long live revolution.

477
00:36:26,751 --> 00:36:27,615
Come on go inside.

478
00:36:28,753 --> 00:36:30,380
Sir come here.

479
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:33,050
This is the new man that
the supervisor told about.

480
00:36:33,758 --> 00:36:37,387
So you wore the Uniform the
moment you left our place, isn't it?

481
00:36:38,763 --> 00:36:41,732
Which is my room?
- Room?

482
00:36:42,667 --> 00:36:43,998
This is your room.

483
00:36:44,602 --> 00:36:48,129
From today you are the occupier
of this 6 foot bed.

484
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:51,667
In the factory, you were inquiring
many things weren't you?

485
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:52,900
What were those things?

486
00:36:53,444 --> 00:36:56,242
I was looking at the faces of the workers
and understanding their nature.

487
00:36:56,447 --> 00:36:58,142
Did you do so?
- Yes, I understood.

488
00:36:58,449 --> 00:37:01,748
I understood that the workers
here are more of pretenders.

489
00:37:13,798 --> 00:37:17,598
Did you get that what I told you?

490
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:18,831
Siddhartha.

491
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:33,446
Siddhartha. Siddhartha. Siddhartha.

492
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:36,616
It was you, Mukundan?

493
00:37:37,154 --> 00:37:38,280
How many times I yelled?

494
00:37:38,489 --> 00:37:40,116
Did you? I could not hear due
to all this noise.

495
00:37:40,324 --> 00:37:43,293
Then how is Mukundan, now?
How is your work etc? Very good isn't it?

496
00:37:43,494 --> 00:37:44,620
It is very good. - Yes.

497
00:37:45,329 --> 00:37:49,629
A special comfort is there.
A comfort that did not get so long.

498
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:52,130
Then all the people who work with
you are also comfortable like you, isn't it?

499
00:37:52,336 --> 00:37:54,531
Yes. Since they are enjoying
this comfort for so long,

500
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:56,569
they did not feel so comfortable as I felt.

501
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:58,639
If there is some such thing
then note it and keep it.

502
00:37:58,876 --> 00:38:00,707
You have to give a report to
the party secretary isn't it?

503
00:38:01,078 --> 00:38:03,069
That I am noting from time to time.
- I see.

504
00:38:03,347 --> 00:38:05,645
Carry weights for 12 hours continuously...

505
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:10,080
...taking a bath in the open,
eating salt less Khaboos...

506
00:38:10,354 --> 00:38:12,322
I have no objection any of them?
- Then what is the problem?

507
00:38:12,523 --> 00:38:16,823
But if I could work in place that
was more airy and with more light,

508
00:38:17,061 --> 00:38:18,153
then it would have been much better.

509
00:38:18,362 --> 00:38:21,160
Why you ask for a little air
and little light?

510
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:25,330
I will get you to place, with good air
and good light. Enough? - That is enough.

511
00:39:19,056 --> 00:39:22,719
With good air
and good light

512
00:39:35,106 --> 00:39:35,902
Who is it?

513
00:39:37,274 --> 00:39:42,234
That man has not come to work today.
Do one thing...

514
00:39:47,451 --> 00:39:48,850
Are you a Malayalee?
- Yes.

515
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:51,645
Good. I want to meet your boss.

516
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:54,585
I have written complaint in full detail...

517
00:39:54,792 --> 00:39:56,851
about this organization and about
the injustices done here.

518
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:58,085
I want to give to the boss over here.

519
00:39:58,863 --> 00:40:00,592
Who are you?
- I am no one special.

520
00:40:00,798 --> 00:40:02,265
You can say that a man
who understands...

521
00:40:02,466 --> 00:40:04,764
the problems of workers and
also tries to solve them.

522
00:40:05,469 --> 00:40:08,438
The M. D is in a meeting.
- I will wait. You just give it to him.

523
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:22,776
Red Salute, Comrade.
Welcome to, Dubai.

524
00:40:25,489 --> 00:40:27,684
Hey what is this Mukundan, going?

525
00:40:28,826 --> 00:40:30,794
Since there was some
misunderstanding...

526
00:40:30,995 --> 00:40:32,792
...in our place should show it
even in a foreign country?

527
00:40:33,497 --> 00:40:34,623
Come, Mukundan. Sit down.

528
00:40:44,341 --> 00:40:47,640
Sit down. Tell me how are things?

529
00:40:47,845 --> 00:40:50,643
Have you come here after locking
up the companies in our place?

530
00:40:50,848 --> 00:40:53,316
Hey, relax I was justjoking.

531
00:40:53,517 --> 00:40:56,145
What you want to drink?
Tea, coffee, juice...

532
00:40:56,687 --> 00:41:00,589
...just a minute.
Miss Merlin, get me a juice.

533
00:41:02,359 --> 00:41:03,826
Did you see the complain I gave?

534
00:41:04,028 --> 00:41:05,393
Yes, I saw it. I read it.

535
00:41:07,364 --> 00:41:09,992
Here too your political functioning
seems to be continuing Is it?

536
00:41:10,701 --> 00:41:14,159
Though a complaint, when I saw
Malayalam I was taken aback.

537
00:41:14,872 --> 00:41:18,171
You have found out all the problems
and have written it all in full detail.

538
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:24,179
As a Union leader, to always
engage in labor discussions

539
00:41:24,381 --> 00:41:27,680
to say as far as I am concerned
is a very nostalgic experience.

540
00:41:28,052 --> 00:41:32,512
After leaving our place I really miss it.
Keep it here.

541
00:41:32,723 --> 00:41:35,749
Juice please. - Have it. Have it.

542
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,526
It is an organization where hundreds
of people are working, isn't it?

543
00:41:38,729 --> 00:41:40,356
I did not know when Mukundan joined.

544
00:41:41,131 --> 00:41:44,464
Hence according to previous experience
and capacity of the comrade...

545
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:46,192
I could not give you a job.

546
00:41:47,137 --> 00:41:48,695
Only now I feel relaxed.

547
00:41:49,907 --> 00:41:53,866
At least now you understood that I did not
go on strike due to any personal vendetta.

548
00:41:54,078 --> 00:41:56,876
I am very satisfied.
- I forgot all that at that time itself.

549
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:59,547
Now your present problem
is a good job for you.

550
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:03,043
Whatjob will I give to, Mukundan?

551
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:06,652
Your experience is to instigate
workers to strike isn't it?

552
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:07,721
But never mind.

553
00:42:08,325 --> 00:42:12,728
The bestjob for comrade without much
physical trouble, a suitable job for you.

554
00:42:14,164 --> 00:42:14,994
Comrade you do one thing.

555
00:42:15,432 --> 00:42:20,563
Here, these data you feed them
in this Laptop.

556
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:30,408
In a country where unemployment
is on the increase

557
00:42:30,614 --> 00:42:33,583
Know that there is no food for them.

558
00:42:33,784 --> 00:42:37,083
First get the work for all hands.

559
00:42:37,288 --> 00:42:40,257
Then we can bring in computer.

560
00:42:40,457 --> 00:42:43,085
Let the computer go to dogs.

561
00:42:43,294 --> 00:42:46,161
Though the party has changed
its views slightly from the old outlooks...

562
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:48,589
personally I am against the computers.

563
00:42:48,799 --> 00:42:50,426
Not because you don't know, isn't it?

564
00:42:52,202 --> 00:42:53,260
Ok, let it go.

565
00:42:54,071 --> 00:43:00,442
The story so far if you ask, comrade
Cuba Mukundan came to, Dubai to make money.

566
00:43:01,312 --> 00:43:04,713
Doesn't know to work physically.
Doesn't know the language.

567
00:43:05,215 --> 00:43:06,614
Does not know the computer too.

568
00:43:07,051 --> 00:43:09,451
The people who know these too
are struggling over here.

569
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:16,124
And the only job you know is to organize strikes.
You can't do that here at all.

570
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:22,630
When you have your self realized that
you are good for nothing, keep thatjuice there.

571
00:43:23,334 --> 00:43:24,562
Get out of here.

572
00:43:52,029 --> 00:43:56,329
CD. CD.

573
00:43:58,869 --> 00:44:00,996
You Malabari?
- Yes.

574
00:44:02,606 --> 00:44:06,667
Mammuti, Mohanlal, Siraskopi.
- What?

575
00:44:15,252 --> 00:44:20,087
Mammuti, Mohanlal, Siraskopi.

576
00:44:23,027 --> 00:44:25,154
Siroskopi, no. Suresh Gopi.

577
00:44:25,462 --> 00:44:26,258
Siroskopi.

578
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:28,498
Siroskopi, no. Suresh Gopi.

579
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:31,827
You film? Sell CD?

580
00:44:32,302 --> 00:44:33,826
Saudiram. Saudiram.

581
00:44:34,872 --> 00:44:42,005
No job, no house, no TV.
You Nepali?

582
00:44:42,212 --> 00:44:45,181
I Sumi, China.
- China?

583
00:44:46,216 --> 00:44:47,342
Communist China?

584
00:44:48,485 --> 00:44:50,009
Great Communist China.

585
00:44:51,055 --> 00:44:54,923
I wish you get a job when we meet again
you should buy CD from me then.

586
00:44:57,127 --> 00:45:00,187
A china which has no evil doers
and no bad people.

587
00:45:00,497 --> 00:45:03,694
A china where labor
is always respected.

588
00:45:04,001 --> 00:45:07,368
China is a very good country...

589
00:45:07,638 --> 00:45:09,538
...where good people are born.
China is very good.

590
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:12,937
A china which has no evil doers
and no bad people.

591
00:45:13,477 --> 00:45:17,106
A china where labor is
always respected.

592
00:45:18,449 --> 00:45:19,939
Madam CD?
- No thanks.

593
00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:30,390
China. China. Wait.

594
00:45:32,996 --> 00:45:35,487
You China? I Kerala. Communist.

595
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:39,228
China full Communist.
Kerala full Communist.

596
00:45:39,436 --> 00:45:44,567
Your Mao Tse Tung is P. Krishna Pillai.
Long live Revolution.

597
00:45:46,043 --> 00:45:50,412
Before when there was a war between
China and India, we stood by China.

598
00:45:50,948 --> 00:45:53,917
Then Quit India strike. 1942.

599
00:45:54,184 --> 00:45:58,348
Britain, we stood by them in your support.
You should not forget that.

600
00:45:58,555 --> 00:46:01,251
You selling pirated Cds. Bad. Very bad.

601
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:06,589
I can't understand what you are saying.

602
00:46:07,998 --> 00:46:08,692
China.

603
00:46:13,403 --> 00:46:14,870
More difficult than even beggars.

604
00:46:15,639 --> 00:46:19,439
Who is it? Thief. Thief.
Thief. Thief.

605
00:46:22,012 --> 00:46:24,446
Come running. Save me.
Thief. Thief.

606
00:46:25,048 --> 00:46:25,707
Who is a thief?

607
00:46:25,916 --> 00:46:29,113
I just searched for some water in your bag.
For that you shout like this?

608
00:46:29,319 --> 00:46:30,946
When you touch my bag,
shouldn't you ask me?

609
00:46:31,155 --> 00:46:33,282
If I should ask you, you should
be near the bag isn't it?

610
00:46:34,491 --> 00:46:40,293
Yes. A dupe told me to come to this park
and he will introduce me to person for a job.

611
00:46:40,497 --> 00:46:44,627
This field is 600 acres big, and I am going around
this place since morning in search of him.

612
00:46:45,269 --> 00:46:47,794
He duped me. I am so hungry
I might die.

613
00:46:48,172 --> 00:46:52,131
When I was so thirsty,
I looked for water in the bag.

614
00:46:52,342 --> 00:46:56,472
I see. When one sees this tie etc one thinks
you are a big man in a big post.

615
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:58,147
You too don't have a job, isn't it?

616
00:46:59,383 --> 00:47:00,315
Whatjob do you do?

617
00:47:00,517 --> 00:47:02,314
If I had any then would I come...
...and sleep in this park?

618
00:47:04,188 --> 00:47:07,817
Then if you see, we both are vehicles
that run on the same route, isn't it?

619
00:47:08,692 --> 00:47:11,593
By the by I will introduce myself.
I am James Trivandrum.

620
00:47:12,296 --> 00:47:14,628
I see, I am Mukundan, Chemmannoor.
- Thank you.

621
00:47:16,633 --> 00:47:20,000
Then we have common basic
subject to be discussed.

622
00:47:20,204 --> 00:47:22,172
If you don't mind come along.
- What?

623
00:47:22,873 --> 00:47:25,341
Sorry, you don't know Arabic, isn't it?
Come with me.

624
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:35,508
Green apple, good to eat. 10 dirham,
120 Indian rupees. Don't want?

625
00:47:41,491 --> 00:47:44,426
6 Dirham 50 fills. It is 75 Indian Rupees.

626
00:47:44,628 --> 00:47:46,357
But we don't have a place
to cook, do we?

627
00:47:47,064 --> 00:47:48,861
Let us see something
which is very low priced...

628
00:47:49,066 --> 00:47:52,297
...and which we can eat
as soon as we buy it.

629
00:47:52,736 --> 00:47:55,967
There it is. I got it.
Let us take 4.

630
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:57,199
Khuboos(bread).

631
00:48:00,577 --> 00:48:02,306
This is Yogurt.
Both together Mukundan dirhams.

632
00:48:02,512 --> 00:48:05,538
It is 24 Indian rupees.
At least is this Ok? - Yes.

633
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:08,547
Give. From tomorrow Ramzan
fasting begins.

634
00:48:08,752 --> 00:48:12,449
Then one can't eat anything in public.
Though it has an advantage.

635
00:48:12,689 --> 00:48:15,886
Since there are no mosquitoes
we can sleep in the park isn't it?

636
00:48:16,093 --> 00:48:18,561
Yes you can, but the snacks we bought
will be wasted isn't it?

637
00:48:18,762 --> 00:48:20,229
If we lie there the police
will take it away.

638
00:48:20,430 --> 00:48:22,557
After that they will take care of our food.

639
00:48:22,766 --> 00:48:26,395
Now hold this. There you have
to pay the bill. Go. Go.

640
00:48:35,345 --> 00:48:37,905
When I came to Dubai,
I stayed here.

641
00:48:38,115 --> 00:48:41,983
Then don't make any noise, or any
trouble VIPs are staying nearby.

642
00:48:44,955 --> 00:48:47,583
Later I may forget. Take out 10 dirhams.
- What for?

643
00:48:48,191 --> 00:48:51,490
Didn't you see me give 20 Dirhams to lie
in this place to the watchman?

644
00:48:51,695 --> 00:48:53,026
Half of that amount is 10.

645
00:48:53,297 --> 00:48:56,266
I saw you talking to him but I did not
see you give him anything.

646
00:48:56,466 --> 00:48:59,594
Will any one give bribe openly?
Give me 10 dirhams.

647
00:49:01,805 --> 00:49:04,774
If I give you 10 then I don't even have
money to even buy cold water.

648
00:49:06,076 --> 00:49:08,101
For that there is a way.
From tomorrow fasting starts.

649
00:49:08,312 --> 00:49:09,836
We need not eat anything
during the day, isn't it?

650
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:11,777
The fasting is for only
the Muslims isn't it?

651
00:49:12,649 --> 00:49:14,378
Whoever fasts will get blessings.

652
00:49:14,584 --> 00:49:16,779
That is what is said in Quran. Ok?

653
00:49:17,054 --> 00:49:18,851
When one ends fast what will we eat?

654
00:49:19,523 --> 00:49:22,151
The God who gave you mouth will show...
...you a way to feed it too.

655
00:49:22,492 --> 00:49:24,653
I have found of some ways too.

656
00:49:24,928 --> 00:49:29,422
If we had some onion and two green chilly...
...I would enjoy eating it.

657
00:49:32,002 --> 00:49:35,096
If only I could get a job before
my visit visa... ended.

658
00:49:36,373 --> 00:49:38,204
This is my 7th visit visa.

659
00:49:38,442 --> 00:49:41,878
6 times I went and came
...from Iran to change visa.

660
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:43,205
And now this one.

661
00:49:44,014 --> 00:49:46,881
Why didn't James get
a job for so long?

662
00:49:47,351 --> 00:49:48,249
There is substance in it.

663
00:49:48,452 --> 00:49:49,384
The moment the interviewer looks...

664
00:49:49,586 --> 00:49:53,716
. at my face with little care,
they surely find who I am.

665
00:49:53,924 --> 00:49:55,221
I don't know why?

666
00:49:55,425 --> 00:49:58,087
Even if I fill my face with...
courtesy,

667
00:49:58,395 --> 00:50:01,922
in between the frauds which...
...are hidden in me comes out.

668
00:50:06,536 --> 00:50:08,265
When it is time to end the
fast a call for prayer...

669
00:50:08,472 --> 00:50:09,461
...will start on the loud speaker.

670
00:50:09,706 --> 00:50:12,174
At that time, see the fruits etc
kept over there...

671
00:50:12,376 --> 00:50:14,207
...all that are free, we too can have it.

672
00:50:14,411 --> 00:50:15,901
Hey that is not correct.

673
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,175
Not correct? Then you do one thing...

674
00:50:18,382 --> 00:50:20,282
...go to a star hotel, and eat.

675
00:50:20,584 --> 00:50:21,846
You don't have money
in the pocket...

676
00:50:22,052 --> 00:50:24,077
...and are dying of hunger here.

677
00:50:25,122 --> 00:50:27,613
Now see, there is no caste or
religion for the eatables.

678
00:50:28,825 --> 00:50:31,555
Then if any one has any doubt...

679
00:50:31,828 --> 00:50:34,388
...just take this keep it on the head.

680
00:50:34,598 --> 00:50:36,065
I don't have such a cap.

681
00:50:36,433 --> 00:50:37,297
You have a kerchief, isn't it?
- Yes, I have.

682
00:50:37,501 --> 00:50:38,832
Then take it out and tie it
on the head.

683
00:50:39,770 --> 00:50:42,864
When the call for prayer starts...
...the attack starts.

684
00:50:43,306 --> 00:50:43,897
This...

685
00:50:47,611 --> 00:51:00,888
God is Great.
- Come on. God is Great.

686
00:51:01,158 --> 00:51:02,386
Don't make a noise.

687
00:51:31,054 --> 00:51:32,612
If God had given one more hand...

688
00:51:38,562 --> 00:51:39,324
Now hold this.

689
00:51:40,330 --> 00:51:42,730
What for?
- To fill it. Oh god!

690
00:51:42,999 --> 00:51:44,933
I will kill you.

691
00:51:48,305 --> 00:51:49,363
Fill it up.

692
00:51:55,045 --> 00:51:55,670
Let that too be taken.

693
00:51:59,382 --> 00:52:01,282
Look like this small bag isn't enough.

694
00:52:01,485 --> 00:52:03,419
Tomorrow onwards we should
get a gunny bag.

695
00:52:08,525 --> 00:52:08,991
Excuse me...

696
00:52:09,192 --> 00:52:10,853
This man Abbas, is he from our place?

697
00:52:11,061 --> 00:52:12,756
Yes. He is a close friend too.

698
00:52:22,405 --> 00:52:24,373
This is a fish market isn't it, why here?

699
00:52:24,574 --> 00:52:26,667
They had told me to ask for him here.

700
00:52:26,877 --> 00:52:28,572
Is he an owner of a fish company?

701
00:52:28,778 --> 00:52:30,006
Not that he won't be one.

702
00:52:30,914 --> 00:52:33,109
I did not want to...
...trouble any one.

703
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:34,340
But in this situation...

704
00:52:34,551 --> 00:52:37,281
If you don't mind you talk
to him about me too.

705
00:52:44,427 --> 00:52:46,486
Hey, pack that fish.

706
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:50,531
Yes. Fish. Fish. Fish.

707
00:52:52,068 --> 00:52:53,695
Mukundan, how come you are here?

708
00:52:55,438 --> 00:52:56,962
You came here on any party work?

709
00:52:59,576 --> 00:53:00,474
Come I will tell you.

710
00:53:05,949 --> 00:53:06,881
Madam. Madam. Come. Come.

711
00:53:07,083 --> 00:53:08,744
Does he have any other business too?

712
00:53:08,952 --> 00:53:11,182
Yes, he too has work in dry fish too.

713
00:53:12,088 --> 00:53:13,146
I see.

714
00:53:17,961 --> 00:53:19,258
Where has he gone?

715
00:53:21,431 --> 00:53:23,661
So, Kunjunni took out his anger on you.

716
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:24,834
I don't know.

717
00:53:25,268 --> 00:53:28,032
I never expected that Mukundan...
...will get into such a situation.

718
00:53:28,305 --> 00:53:29,738
You want a job isn't it?

719
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:31,566
If only you had come just 5 minutes before...

720
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:33,265
...I would have fixed you up.

721
00:53:33,543 --> 00:53:35,909
Any way be here... I will just go to
vegetable market and come.

722
00:53:41,318 --> 00:53:43,786
You have seen your friend isn't it?
Now shall we go?

723
00:53:45,121 --> 00:53:47,282
Let him come here.
If you are in a hurry you go.

724
00:53:47,490 --> 00:53:48,957
Hey I am not in a hurry.

725
00:53:49,159 --> 00:53:51,593
Today I don't have...
...any important interviews.

726
00:54:01,004 --> 00:54:02,767
What is so special in the papers?

727
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:05,706
This is Karunan. My friend.

728
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:08,002
He is standing for an election as an MLA.

729
00:54:08,211 --> 00:54:08,677
I see.

730
00:54:08,878 --> 00:54:10,812
You are a man with high connections...
...in our place isn't it?

731
00:54:11,014 --> 00:54:14,211
And here you are... eating
Khuboos(bread) and yogurt. Very bad.

732
00:54:19,422 --> 00:54:21,890
Hey your friend is waving out
to you from there.

733
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:23,354
Come. Come. Come.

734
00:54:26,329 --> 00:54:29,787
Mukundan, do you see the
Arab standing there? - Yes.

735
00:54:30,267 --> 00:54:31,564
The man is a big man.

736
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:33,232
He has man with many companies.

737
00:54:33,436 --> 00:54:34,334
He is my permanent customer.

738
00:54:34,537 --> 00:54:36,630
If he wants he can give you a job.

739
00:54:37,907 --> 00:54:39,704
He is a kind man. He will help.

740
00:54:39,909 --> 00:54:41,308
I have told him about you.
Just tell him you are...

741
00:54:41,511 --> 00:54:43,809
...Abbas's friend.
I am going to the shop.

742
00:54:44,014 --> 00:54:47,450
There is no one there.
Let us meet in the evening when I am free. Ok.

743
00:54:54,624 --> 00:54:55,591
Greetings.

744
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:57,726
Greetings.

745
00:54:58,061 --> 00:54:59,619
Are you a friend of Abbas?

746
00:55:01,064 --> 00:55:04,659
Good. How much money brother?
- 10 Dirhams.

747
00:55:04,868 --> 00:55:05,630
I will take it.

748
00:55:06,936 --> 00:55:08,494
No leave it.

749
00:55:08,705 --> 00:55:10,263
It is no trouble. I will take it.

750
00:55:10,507 --> 00:55:11,132
Ok then come along.

751
00:55:13,410 --> 00:55:14,240
What did that Arab say?

752
00:55:14,444 --> 00:55:15,001
I will tell him everything.

753
00:55:15,211 --> 00:55:17,475
You don't know Arabic isn't it?
- Come with me.

754
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:25,019
Come in the night.
I am going to Malaysia for a month.

755
00:55:26,323 --> 00:55:28,484
Come to my office.
I will do something.

756
00:55:30,427 --> 00:55:33,863
You should come today.
I will fix everything.

757
00:55:40,403 --> 00:55:41,665
Ok bye.
- Thanks.

758
00:55:51,114 --> 00:55:51,739
What happened?

759
00:55:52,115 --> 00:55:55,380
He is going to Malaysia for a month.

760
00:55:55,585 --> 00:55:59,043
I said can't you give us a job and
then go later... after a day or two.

761
00:55:59,255 --> 00:56:01,416
He says he has to go today itself.

762
00:56:01,758 --> 00:56:05,558
I have an urgent interview.
I just remembered that.

763
00:56:05,762 --> 00:56:07,855
Now shall I leave?

764
00:56:20,477 --> 00:56:22,877
Where has brother Abdulla gone?
- Gone somewhere.

765
00:56:24,314 --> 00:56:25,542
A little sugar.

766
00:56:26,516 --> 00:56:28,143
You took one Parotha(bread)...

767
00:56:28,351 --> 00:56:30,649
...and you want to have one kg
sugar with it isn't it?

768
00:56:30,854 --> 00:56:32,014
The persons who don't take curry with it...

769
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:34,281
...giving little sugar is ok.

770
00:56:34,491 --> 00:56:36,721
For that should you have...
...like this?

771
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:38,893
Ok, I don't want sugar.

772
00:56:54,911 --> 00:56:56,378
God's grace.

773
00:57:10,427 --> 00:57:12,122
What is this, Indian Rupee?

774
00:57:12,328 --> 00:57:14,193
Dirham is finished.
Aren't you a Malayalee?

775
00:57:14,397 --> 00:57:15,887
You can send Indian Rupees
to India isn't it?

776
00:57:16,099 --> 00:57:18,397
Hey, don't make trouble.
You better give... Dirhams.

777
00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:19,693
I don't have Dirhams friend.

778
00:57:19,903 --> 00:57:22,394
If so you should have told before eating.

779
00:57:22,839 --> 00:57:25,967
For this Indian Rupees should I come to...
...Dubai and do business?

780
00:57:26,176 --> 00:57:31,307
Even in India it won't be taken
in any airport.

781
00:57:31,514 --> 00:57:33,106
Now take it back.
- What is the problem?

782
00:57:33,850 --> 00:57:37,149
He ate stomach full and
gives India Rupees.

783
00:57:38,655 --> 00:57:40,850
Never mind. I will change
the money and give.

784
00:57:41,958 --> 00:57:43,858
Now I will take care here.

785
00:57:44,127 --> 00:57:46,152
Go there and remove...
...those plates.

786
00:57:46,996 --> 00:57:47,860
On that table.

787
00:57:48,598 --> 00:57:49,724
Thank you very much.

788
00:57:49,933 --> 00:57:51,230
Good that you were a Malayalee.

789
00:57:51,434 --> 00:57:54,597
After the fast there was no food
in the mosque, isn't it?

790
00:57:57,774 --> 00:58:00,538
I came to know that you did not
come to the... mosque to pray.

791
00:58:01,110 --> 00:58:02,907
Don't you go to temples...
...in India?

792
00:58:03,446 --> 00:58:05,812
Since in our place there is no
Mosque or Temple...

793
00:58:06,015 --> 00:58:08,415
...I could get introduced
to the Gods directly.

794
00:58:09,352 --> 00:58:13,152
Must be that you must
be liking non believers.

795
00:58:13,456 --> 00:58:15,424
They won't call you often
and bother you, isn't it?

796
00:58:15,625 --> 00:58:18,150
I don't think about those things.

797
00:58:20,630 --> 00:58:23,326
Now, you did not get any job?
- No.

798
00:58:23,666 --> 00:58:25,190
Whatjob do you know?

799
00:58:25,702 --> 00:58:27,465
I have an experience...
...of running a tea shop in our place.

800
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:28,602
Is it? - Yes.

801
00:58:30,139 --> 00:58:32,334
Here two people have gone on leave.

802
00:58:32,809 --> 00:58:34,970
I doubt whether one fellow
will return back.

803
00:58:35,545 --> 00:58:38,446
If you are interested you can
join us here for now.

804
00:58:38,648 --> 00:58:41,811
Suleiman, had called and said...
...he would come next week.

805
00:58:42,018 --> 00:58:43,542
Yes, we will see that at that time.

806
00:58:45,355 --> 00:58:48,654
He is my son in law.
Now don't bother about him.

807
00:58:50,727 --> 00:58:53,890
Brother, give me a cold coca cola.
- Yes sir.

808
00:58:54,998 --> 00:58:57,296
Keep that luggage in
one side, go inside.

809
00:58:57,500 --> 00:59:00,958
Then go and give that man
a bottle of coca cola.

810
00:59:05,074 --> 00:59:05,699
Coca cola?

811
00:59:05,909 --> 00:59:10,312
Hence I am telling the American
Cola companies... to Quit India.

812
00:59:13,583 --> 00:59:16,746
Don't think anything.
We are against Coca Cola.

813
00:59:17,053 --> 00:59:20,318
What? Did Coca cola bit
you are something?

814
00:59:23,526 --> 00:59:24,686
I won't give that.

815
00:59:25,261 --> 00:59:27,126
You are a communist isn't it?

816
00:59:28,398 --> 00:59:33,062
Hey did I not tell not to fix a wash basin...
...in the dining hall many times isn't it?

817
00:59:33,870 --> 00:59:38,170
If it is not as I said I won't
give single paise? What?

818
00:59:39,075 --> 00:59:41,441
Last I bought cement,
what happened to that?

819
00:59:42,345 --> 00:59:45,178
You said you'd finish construction in a year.
...and give me the key,

820
00:59:45,381 --> 00:59:46,405
and now it is three years.

821
00:59:46,883 --> 00:59:50,216
What? Did I not give you money?

822
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:55,216
Hey, Kuriakose don't play those...
...contractor games with me.

823
00:59:55,525 --> 00:59:56,822
If Verghese has money to
waste money on the...

824
00:59:57,026 --> 00:59:58,152
...phone to scold the
contractor in India...

825
00:59:58,361 --> 01:00:00,090
...you could build house in
India with that money.

826
01:00:02,465 --> 01:00:05,195
He said he make a house
I will make him do it.

827
01:00:05,868 --> 01:00:09,702
At least for a day I want
to stay there.

828
01:00:09,906 --> 01:00:12,773
Then God take me up
the very next day.

829
01:00:13,409 --> 01:00:17,209
A new man too is coming.
Abdulla called and told me.

830
01:00:17,547 --> 01:00:19,777
Then share of rent will reduce a little.

831
01:00:20,116 --> 01:00:22,448
With that money, we can purchase one...
...sack of cement with it.

832
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:26,384
"Sister he is mad about you..."

833
01:00:26,589 --> 01:00:30,548
Hey, now he is in the bathroom.

834
01:00:30,793 --> 01:00:32,522
If he bathes...
...like this all money will be lost.

835
01:00:32,762 --> 01:00:36,198
This guy needs 100 litres
of water to bathe.

836
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:38,528
Hey Sirish, finish it soon.

837
01:00:38,735 --> 01:00:42,034
Hey, Varghese I did not take a
bathe due to cold.

838
01:00:42,271 --> 01:00:44,239
Let Sirish take that water too.

839
01:00:44,474 --> 01:00:46,203
When we stay together like this
don't see... these small things.

840
01:00:46,409 --> 01:00:49,105
No don't... - Hey leave it, Varghese.
Has every one come?

841
01:00:49,312 --> 01:00:52,179
Yes. All are in front of the TV.

842
01:00:52,415 --> 01:00:55,612
Though the election is in Kerala...
...all the interest is here.

843
01:00:56,452 --> 01:01:00,548
Which ever beggar wins he won't reduce
the price... of cement and steel.

844
01:01:00,757 --> 01:01:02,088
Then what benefit is there for me?

845
01:01:10,133 --> 01:01:13,967
Greetings. This is news from Asianet.
Now the main Headlines.

846
01:01:14,871 --> 01:01:17,738
Tomorrow there will be a good crowd...
...in Bashir's barber shop.

847
01:01:17,940 --> 01:01:20,204
Shaping moustaches,
tonsuring and all that.

848
01:01:21,277 --> 01:01:24,906
Some who have decided not to come out...
...of the coat even if one dies...

849
01:01:25,114 --> 01:01:27,378
...one can see him dressed as a man.

850
01:01:27,950 --> 01:01:29,747
He has bet that if P.K. Nair is defeated...

851
01:01:29,952 --> 01:01:32,352
...he has promised not to wear
that coat any more.

852
01:01:32,555 --> 01:01:36,389
True, but if Kunnathoor Jacob
gets defeated...

853
01:01:36,693 --> 01:01:40,857
...you should stop writing poems which...
...human can't tolerate.

854
01:01:41,464 --> 01:01:44,126
Then the literary world will
come to stand still.

855
01:01:44,333 --> 01:01:47,666
You who walks with a beauty parlor...
...all 24 hours,

856
01:01:47,970 --> 01:01:49,631
will not understand the...
...pain that people feel.

857
01:01:54,343 --> 01:01:57,335
Here is the new tenant with us.
Mukundan.

858
01:01:59,816 --> 01:02:03,547
This is Nambiar. He is a PRO
in a private company.

859
01:02:03,820 --> 01:02:07,051
Among the Malayalees here,
he is well known.

860
01:02:07,557 --> 01:02:08,285
Hello.

861
01:02:08,825 --> 01:02:11,350
Right from 1971 I am here.

862
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:13,552
It is that day he entered this coat.

863
01:02:13,763 --> 01:02:15,594
Then till today he has not
come out of it.

864
01:02:15,998 --> 01:02:18,125
They know him only as Coat Nambiar.

865
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:21,859
I am Pongunni, That is Varghese...
- Hi.

866
01:02:22,071 --> 01:02:22,799
I am Sirish.

867
01:02:23,005 --> 01:02:24,700
I am Anandan.
- I am Abu.

868
01:02:25,274 --> 01:02:27,071
I am Viswam Kathalikkad.

869
01:02:27,343 --> 01:02:29,004
If you have reading habit then
you would have heard.

870
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:31,569
Mukundan is a communist.

871
01:02:31,848 --> 01:02:34,009
Your poetry doesn't come
in their papers.

872
01:02:37,687 --> 01:02:40,656
Sihabuddin from Karunagapalli
won from Quilon.

873
01:02:40,857 --> 01:02:46,659
He defeated the usual
winner R. Gopakumar.

874
01:02:46,863 --> 01:02:50,094
In Kozhikode candidate Najeeb defeated...

875
01:02:50,299 --> 01:02:54,235
...his nearest rival Mohd.
Jabbar by 762 votes.

876
01:02:54,704 --> 01:02:59,073
This is the first time a socialist
party is winning here.

877
01:02:59,408 --> 01:03:05,074
Long live communism.
Long live our leader.

878
01:03:05,281 --> 01:03:08,682
Now we got the result
from Chemmannoor.

879
01:03:08,885 --> 01:03:10,512
P.P. Karunan, from there
defeated his nearest...

880
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:13,484
...rival Sudhakaran by 7304 votes.

881
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:18,822
He is my colleague.

882
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:20,785
We were together...
...functioning in the party.

883
01:03:22,231 --> 01:03:24,961
But the majority has reduced a lot.

884
01:03:37,914 --> 01:03:40,883
Hello, yes. I will give.

885
01:03:42,652 --> 01:03:50,855
Hello. Yes, Mukundan.
Red Salute comrade.

886
01:03:51,294 --> 01:03:53,592
Yes, I saw the new of
your victory on TV.

887
01:03:54,197 --> 01:03:56,131
But the majority has reduced a lot.

888
01:03:57,033 --> 01:04:03,199
I have made a list of things to
be done... our constituency.

889
01:04:03,606 --> 01:04:07,565
Now stop going around...
...TV channels, Newspapers etc.

890
01:04:07,944 --> 01:04:10,879
Where there is no Assembly you should be...
...present in Chemmannoor.

891
01:04:11,147 --> 01:04:12,114
Yes. Yes.

892
01:04:12,882 --> 01:04:15,976
We will take care of thing over
here with the comrades.

893
01:04:17,053 --> 01:04:19,351
Comrade should not think of it
and worry about it.

894
01:04:20,456 --> 01:04:23,152
Then do you remember
why you went there?

895
01:04:23,659 --> 01:04:26,492
The Bank Manager calls in between
and... worries us.

896
01:04:27,163 --> 01:04:29,927
The money you get send here...
...without spending lavishly.

897
01:04:30,132 --> 01:04:33,295
Try to repay the bank loan...
...as soon as possible.

898
01:04:33,669 --> 01:04:37,196
I won't say about spending
lavishly the money I get.

899
01:04:37,473 --> 01:04:38,599
My card is about to finish.

900
01:04:39,475 --> 01:04:41,375
Tell all the comrades... that I inquired
about all the comrades.

901
01:04:41,577 --> 01:04:42,509
Ok. Ok.

902
01:04:44,146 --> 01:04:46,637
Look like Cuba Mukundan is
gone from our hands.

903
01:04:46,883 --> 01:04:48,441
When he went there he
forgot everything.

904
01:04:48,651 --> 01:04:50,448
He forgot the bank loan,
forgot this place...

905
01:04:50,653 --> 01:04:52,518
...forgot the Party and
his comrades too.

906
01:04:55,658 --> 01:04:58,718
He is minting money in Dubai, isn't it?

907
01:05:07,937 --> 01:05:09,962
One Suleimani.
- One Suleimani.

908
01:05:18,247 --> 01:05:20,613
Hey, get that tea quickly.
- Yes.

909
01:05:22,018 --> 01:05:23,417
Mukunda, why are you here?

910
01:05:23,786 --> 01:05:24,980
Hey, Abbas?

911
01:05:25,187 --> 01:05:26,620
I have a job here.

912
01:05:26,856 --> 01:05:27,379
Here?
- Yes.

913
01:05:27,590 --> 01:05:30,320
Then did you leave the job I gave with that Arab...
...I introduced in the market?

914
01:05:30,526 --> 01:05:31,993
That Arab did not give me work.

915
01:05:32,194 --> 01:05:33,821
It seems the next day he is
going somewhere...

916
01:05:34,030 --> 01:05:35,224
...and that he would come
6 months later only.

917
01:05:35,431 --> 01:05:37,490
That is what he said to James
who was with me.

918
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:40,828
It was James who spoke to him.
- I do not know Arabic.

919
01:05:42,038 --> 01:05:44,802
The next I met him he said that he gave...
...the job to my friend, that is you.

920
01:05:53,649 --> 01:05:56,311
Greetings, boss.
I am Abbas the fisherman.

921
01:05:56,652 --> 01:05:57,619
How are you?

922
01:05:58,421 --> 01:06:01,481
There is a friend of mine working there.

923
01:06:01,891 --> 01:06:02,983
Is he there now?

924
01:06:07,063 --> 01:06:09,657
Ok. Ok. Thanks. Bye.

925
01:06:10,733 --> 01:06:11,700
What is the matter?

926
01:06:12,168 --> 01:06:13,692
That fellow took thatjob.

927
01:06:14,170 --> 01:06:15,603
It is that cheat who was with you.

928
01:06:15,805 --> 01:06:18,706
He is a permanent staff in that company.
- Who that James?

929
01:06:21,277 --> 01:06:23,745
Though we had difference of
opinion in Chemmannoor...

930
01:06:24,146 --> 01:06:27,445
...I had high regards for you.

931
01:06:27,984 --> 01:06:30,782
The determination and courage you
showed... to defend our place,

932
01:06:30,987 --> 01:06:33,182
you could show a little of it...
...in your own life isn't it?

933
01:06:33,389 --> 01:06:34,720
What has happened to you?

934
01:06:37,293 --> 01:06:40,626
They made a story that Comrade Society Gopalan
...made a scam for money in the party...

935
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:42,297
...and you swallowed
that story fully...

936
01:06:42,498 --> 01:06:44,796
...and took up the responsibility to repay it...
...and for that you came to Dubai.

937
01:06:45,368 --> 01:06:47,199
I did not believe that Gopalan did so.

938
01:06:47,403 --> 01:06:48,768
And you his own son believed it?

939
01:06:49,005 --> 01:06:51,473
I did not believe it.
But proofs were so.

940
01:06:51,674 --> 01:06:53,141
Proof. What happened then?

941
01:06:53,342 --> 01:06:55,469
That Karunan got in your place...
...and became an MLA too.

942
01:06:55,678 --> 01:06:57,612
I don't want to become
an MLA or a minister.

943
01:06:57,813 --> 01:07:01,613
I and dad did not work in
the party for posts.

944
01:07:01,851 --> 01:07:04,945
But to stop non merited
people getting posts...

945
01:07:05,154 --> 01:07:07,384
...in the party and to fulfill the responsibility
...towards the Party and the people...

946
01:07:07,590 --> 01:07:10,491
...it is the duty of the party functionary to accept
...the posts given to them.

947
01:07:11,394 --> 01:07:14,295
If something happens to
resign or take leave...

948
01:07:14,497 --> 01:07:16,260
...who are you?
Are you A.K. Antony?

949
01:07:24,373 --> 01:07:26,364
My Lucy, send the children
to school then...

950
01:07:26,575 --> 01:07:28,941
...go to the building site
and stand there.

951
01:07:29,512 --> 01:07:32,447
In a wink's time they will sell off
cement sacks... steel rods.

952
01:07:33,015 --> 01:07:34,346
Ok, here the card is over.

953
01:07:34,683 --> 01:07:35,945
Chicken fry and Biriyani is ready.

954
01:07:36,852 --> 01:07:39,047
Daily chicken?
This will not do.

955
01:07:39,255 --> 01:07:40,984
I have cholesterol,
I won't give my share.

956
01:07:41,190 --> 01:07:43,055
You need not give for today.

957
01:07:43,259 --> 01:07:46,387
This is from me. Tomorrow my daughter...
...is getting married.

958
01:07:46,629 --> 01:07:50,360
Oh! If that is so, if I have one piece...
...my cholesterol won't increase.

959
01:07:50,566 --> 01:07:52,534
If you don't have to give share...
...even if you have daily,

960
01:07:52,735 --> 01:07:54,293
you won't fall sick.
Isn't it sir?

961
01:07:54,804 --> 01:07:57,295
What ever it is don't give
Coat Nambiar any chicken.

962
01:07:58,107 --> 01:07:58,869
Hey, you have come?

963
01:07:59,608 --> 01:08:00,905
Who is it? A friend?

964
01:08:01,110 --> 01:08:03,169
Yes. He is Abbas.
He is from my place.

965
01:08:03,379 --> 01:08:04,107
In which company do you work?

966
01:08:04,313 --> 01:08:06,008
Not in a company.
I work in the fish market.

967
01:08:06,482 --> 01:08:08,450
In Dubai or Sharjah?
- In Dubai itself.

968
01:08:09,418 --> 01:08:11,909
You both wash your hands and come.
- What is special today?

969
01:08:12,254 --> 01:08:15,280
My daughters marriage day.
I see. A happiness for that.

970
01:08:15,558 --> 01:08:16,183
You sit here.

971
01:08:16,392 --> 01:08:18,019
I will bring one more plate too.

972
01:08:18,661 --> 01:08:20,492
Come let us sit inside.
- Yes.

973
01:08:25,334 --> 01:08:27,802
When your daughter is getting married then...
...why did you not go home?

974
01:08:28,571 --> 01:08:30,539
What will I do going there now?

975
01:08:30,806 --> 01:08:32,467
For wedding what is needed
is gold and money.

976
01:08:32,675 --> 01:08:34,643
That I have sent as needed.

977
01:08:34,844 --> 01:08:37,745
For seeing all the things,
she has Uncles.

978
01:08:37,980 --> 01:08:39,971
My three brothers too are there.

979
01:08:40,449 --> 01:08:43,646
With the ticket money I can buy more gold.

980
01:08:43,986 --> 01:08:45,783
I am not needed at all there.

981
01:08:46,589 --> 01:08:48,887
But last night daughter had called.

982
01:08:49,091 --> 01:08:53,892
She asked dad, why did you not...
...come for the wedding and cried.

983
01:08:54,763 --> 01:08:56,993
I too could not control.

984
01:09:00,302 --> 01:09:00,996
Don't cry.

985
01:09:29,832 --> 01:09:38,900
"Thathithga thai dhom
clap to the tunes."

986
01:09:39,275 --> 01:09:48,240
"Thathithga thai dhom
clap to the tunes."

987
01:09:52,955 --> 01:10:02,262
"The village people ask
when I will return?"

988
01:10:02,464 --> 01:10:11,031
"I too don't want to return back here."

989
01:10:11,740 --> 01:10:20,114
"The frogs that cry endlessly..."
"In the fields I saw in my memory."

990
01:10:21,150 --> 01:10:30,388
"I saw the drying plants in
the sun in my dreams."

991
01:10:30,593 --> 01:10:39,626
"The village people ask
when I will return?"

992
01:10:40,002 --> 01:10:48,967
"I too don't want to return back here."

993
01:11:04,026 --> 01:11:12,832
"Thathithga thai dhom
clap to the tunes."

994
01:11:13,035 --> 01:11:17,495
"In shape the flowers,
in full moonlight..."

995
01:11:17,706 --> 01:11:22,336
"...When the boats of
Tiruvonam move on..."

996
01:11:22,544 --> 01:11:26,947
"In shape the flowers,
in full moonlight..."

997
01:11:27,149 --> 01:11:30,346
"...When the boats of
Tiruvonam move on..."

998
01:11:31,887 --> 01:11:36,347
"My place which the waves
touch forever call me back..."

999
01:11:36,558 --> 01:11:41,018
"...like the sweet dreams with the
sweetness of the coconut water."

1000
01:11:41,397 --> 01:11:52,865
"The village people ask
when I will return?"

1001
01:11:53,075 --> 01:12:02,711
"I too don't want to
return back here."

1002
01:12:23,772 --> 01:12:32,908
"When the oars move the boat on my chest
the pains came out as a song."

1003
01:12:33,115 --> 01:12:42,183
"When the oars move the boat on my chest
the pains came out as a song."

1004
01:12:42,458 --> 01:12:51,765
"In the song that was sung from the heart..."
"...I heard the whimper behind it."

1005
01:12:51,967 --> 01:13:03,105
"The village people ask
when I will return?"

1006
01:13:03,712 --> 01:13:12,780
"I too don't want to return back here."

1007
01:13:13,155 --> 01:13:21,460
"The frogs that cry endlessly..."
"In the fields I saw in my memory."

1008
01:13:22,498 --> 01:13:31,463
"I saw the drying plants in
the sun in my dreams."

1009
01:13:32,007 --> 01:13:41,314
"The village people ask
when I will return?"

1010
01:13:41,517 --> 01:13:50,824
"I too don't want to return back here."

1011
01:13:51,393 --> 01:13:53,418
Hey, go. Go there.

1012
01:13:54,897 --> 01:13:59,163
Ritish, after him it is me.
You go there.

1013
01:14:01,403 --> 01:14:03,997
Hey, coat come out.

1014
01:14:08,410 --> 01:14:09,536
How long you took?

1015
01:14:09,912 --> 01:14:13,006
Should I not finish taking bath, Varghese?
- Ok, go.

1016
01:14:17,519 --> 01:14:19,817
Latest CD. New CD.

1017
01:14:35,103 --> 01:14:35,569
You run away. Go.

1018
01:14:56,825 --> 01:14:58,486
Me, there...

1019
01:15:20,148 --> 01:15:21,672
You fool, where did you come from?

1020
01:15:21,884 --> 01:15:25,820
I lost all my earning.
Are you riding bicycle blindly?

1021
01:15:26,154 --> 01:15:28,679
Why police coming. I afraid.

1022
01:15:30,392 --> 01:15:32,917
You don't say anything.
All my earning was in that bag.

1023
01:15:33,228 --> 01:15:35,628
What I will do?
Get lost from here.

1024
01:15:36,098 --> 01:15:37,827
Why angry? I love China.

1025
01:15:38,333 --> 01:15:39,732
You fool. Fool.

1026
01:15:55,183 --> 01:16:00,348
Oh, God. Oh, God.

1027
01:16:16,471 --> 01:16:17,768
If you lie like this for a while it is ok.

1028
01:16:17,973 --> 01:16:19,372
Everything will be alright. Ok?

1029
01:16:19,641 --> 01:16:20,869
You are a Malayalee?
- Yes.

1030
01:16:21,577 --> 01:16:24,137
Half the people in the Gulf
are our people.

1031
01:16:24,646 --> 01:16:27,114
What is daughter's name?
- Maya.

1032
01:16:27,683 --> 01:16:29,844
Where in Kerala?
- Near, Kannanoor.

1033
01:16:31,253 --> 01:16:32,185
I am from Chemmannoor.

1034
01:16:32,387 --> 01:16:34,787
Is it? My house too near there.

1035
01:16:35,023 --> 01:16:38,618
Do you know a retired headmaster Balan...
...from Cherkarai? - Yes.

1036
01:16:38,827 --> 01:16:41,091
He is my dad.
- Is it? Yes.

1037
01:16:41,330 --> 01:16:43,628
Isn't he the right wing Communist
party leader... Balan teacher?

1038
01:16:43,832 --> 01:16:45,231
He has taught me in school.

1039
01:16:55,911 --> 01:16:58,573
Though the war is in Iraq,
Palestine and Lebanon...

1040
01:16:58,780 --> 01:17:01,214
...it is being suffered by us poor people.

1041
01:17:01,416 --> 01:17:03,976
What Karim? Did any one put a bomb on
your head... in the market place?

1042
01:17:04,186 --> 01:17:06,313
Bomb? This is a missile.
A missile.

1043
01:17:06,521 --> 01:17:09,581
What rise of prices for fish
and vegetables.

1044
01:17:10,359 --> 01:17:13,419
Then till the war is over
I will go to the market.

1045
01:17:13,629 --> 01:17:15,221
I too want to see if the
prices come down.

1046
01:17:15,430 --> 01:17:18,365
Uncle, you go to the room
and take rest.

1047
01:17:18,734 --> 01:17:20,998
Don't move more.
You have slip disc. It is a risk.

1048
01:17:21,203 --> 01:17:22,830
I will look after the management
and accounts

1049
01:17:23,038 --> 01:17:27,065
...and give you the whole accounts
in the room, in the night everyday.

1050
01:17:27,275 --> 01:17:30,574
Yes. In spite of me being here...
. money goes missing from here.

1051
01:17:31,413 --> 01:17:33,278
From today when I am not there...

1052
01:17:33,482 --> 01:17:34,847
...let Mukundan handle the cash here.

1053
01:17:37,052 --> 01:17:38,781
I am not used to sit and work.

1054
01:17:38,987 --> 01:17:41,785
Then from today get used to it.
What?

1055
01:17:42,758 --> 01:17:43,247
Yes.

1056
01:17:45,560 --> 01:17:47,323
A man who just came yesterday...

1057
01:17:47,562 --> 01:17:48,859
...who doesn't utter God's name,
a non believer...

1058
01:17:49,064 --> 01:17:51,259
...and you entrust him with cash?

1059
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:53,495
I am you own son in law,
that too a believer...

1060
01:17:53,802 --> 01:17:56,635
...yet you don't value me?

1061
01:17:56,838 --> 01:17:58,999
Don't teach me, about believers
and non believers.

1062
01:17:59,441 --> 01:18:01,136
There is caste which is
neither of these.

1063
01:18:01,343 --> 01:18:04,972
Con men. The say Kabada Viswasi
in Malayalam.

1064
01:18:05,414 --> 01:18:07,609
Mukundan, is an atheist.

1065
01:18:07,983 --> 01:18:11,180
But he doesn't do anything
that God doesn't like.

1066
01:18:11,586 --> 01:18:13,110
Mukundan, come here and sit.

1067
01:18:13,321 --> 01:18:14,618
I will go to the mosque and come.

1068
01:18:15,857 --> 01:18:16,619
You come.

1069
01:18:18,593 --> 01:18:21,858
Sit here. Sit here. Sit here.

1070
01:18:23,265 --> 01:18:23,959
Sit here.

1071
01:18:25,033 --> 01:18:25,897
I will come now.

1072
01:18:51,660 --> 01:18:53,992
I brought you from the airport.

1073
01:18:54,296 --> 01:18:56,196
I took you up to the job places.

1074
01:18:56,465 --> 01:19:00,231
And you left one day without even...
...saying a single word to me.

1075
01:19:00,969 --> 01:19:02,869
Where all I inquired and found
this place do you know?

1076
01:19:03,071 --> 01:19:04,766
Why did you take so much
trouble and found me?

1077
01:19:05,574 --> 01:19:06,700
I understood everything.

1078
01:19:07,542 --> 01:19:09,772
Since I organized a strike before
Kunjunni's... leather factory,

1079
01:19:09,978 --> 01:19:11,070
you all trapped me
and got me here.

1080
01:19:11,580 --> 01:19:12,604
All these was for revenge isn't it?

1081
01:19:13,582 --> 01:19:15,846
I told you I would go to
China or Cuba.

1082
01:19:16,051 --> 01:19:16,813
You all did not agree.

1083
01:19:17,018 --> 01:19:19,452
They said there are trees
on which money grows.

1084
01:19:19,654 --> 01:19:22,179
I didn't see any of those, so far.

1085
01:19:22,524 --> 01:19:25,288
I just want to know now
if Karunan too was in this.

1086
01:19:26,161 --> 01:19:27,355
Which, Kunjunni boss?

1087
01:19:27,562 --> 01:19:29,757
The owner of the labor supply company...
...Kunjunni Boss.

1088
01:19:30,098 --> 01:19:32,123
Isn't it his leather factory... we went on
strike against and got it locked up.

1089
01:19:32,334 --> 01:19:34,302
I do not know of any Kunjunni boss...

1090
01:19:34,503 --> 01:19:36,130
...and I don't know of any of your
issues in Kerala too.

1091
01:19:36,505 --> 01:19:37,972
Mukundan, is deep in loan,
get him...

1092
01:19:38,173 --> 01:19:41,165
...so Uncle said to me
when he called me up.

1093
01:19:41,376 --> 01:19:44,243
I went to Kallikandi Haneef
and told him the matter.

1094
01:19:44,446 --> 01:19:45,708
It was he who arranged all this.

1095
01:19:45,914 --> 01:19:48,280
Now if you need any otherjob,
I will get it for you.

1096
01:19:48,850 --> 01:19:51,080
I don't want yourjob,
neither do I want to see you.

1097
01:19:52,354 --> 01:19:55,619
But Uncle calls me and
inquires about you.

1098
01:19:56,725 --> 01:19:58,249
Shouldn't you repay the bank loan?

1099
01:20:00,028 --> 01:20:01,689
Every month if you send
a small amount...

1100
01:20:01,897 --> 01:20:03,660
...it will be like dissolving
asafoetida in the ocean.

1101
01:20:04,699 --> 01:20:07,759
I have told Uncle, that I will make
you join in my... chit fund.

1102
01:20:08,036 --> 01:20:10,402
If it is so you can repay a big amount...
...at one go, isn't it?

1103
01:20:10,639 --> 01:20:12,607
If I feel like joining any chit funds...

1104
01:20:12,808 --> 01:20:14,275
...I will find a suitable to me.

1105
01:20:14,476 --> 01:20:16,103
If you don't trust me ask Abdullakka.

1106
01:20:16,311 --> 01:20:17,505
He too is there in my Chit fund.

1107
01:20:17,712 --> 01:20:18,701
I won't leave you.

1108
01:20:18,947 --> 01:20:25,216
You ate, drank and now say...
...that you don't have money?

1109
01:20:25,987 --> 01:20:29,616
This is usual talk all the useless people
give when they come here.

1110
01:20:40,402 --> 01:20:42,768
Hey, she says she lost
all her money...

1111
01:20:42,971 --> 01:20:44,370
...and she is hungry
for two days.

1112
01:20:44,573 --> 01:20:46,131
She says she will...
...give it after a few days.

1113
01:20:47,075 --> 01:20:48,269
So that is the matter.

1114
01:20:48,476 --> 01:20:51,445
Karim, I will write her money
in my account.

1115
01:20:51,913 --> 01:20:53,437
Who is she?
Is she your Uncle's daughter?

1116
01:20:55,116 --> 01:20:56,515
You money I give.

1117
01:20:57,085 --> 01:21:01,044
But you Chinese taking Coco Cola...
...is not good. No. No.

1118
01:21:07,863 --> 01:21:10,127
Stop. Stop. I will tell you.

1119
01:21:10,599 --> 01:21:11,623
What did she tell about me?

1120
01:21:11,833 --> 01:21:13,164
She said it was you made
her like this.

1121
01:21:13,368 --> 01:21:14,062
In this time you did that too?

1122
01:21:14,269 --> 01:21:16,100
Hey no. It is her misunderstanding.

1123
01:21:16,371 --> 01:21:17,463
Hey you know Chinese isn't it?

1124
01:21:17,672 --> 01:21:20,072
Just call her. I want to tell her
that I am innocent.

1125
01:21:20,275 --> 01:21:21,765
All that I will tell, but what about
joining the chit fund?

1126
01:21:21,977 --> 01:21:24,036
That I will do later.
You call her.

1127
01:21:25,714 --> 01:21:27,409
Or else, since I am busy now...

1128
01:21:27,616 --> 01:21:31,052
...either today or tomorrow can we
meet in some restaurant?

1129
01:21:39,461 --> 01:21:42,760
The Chinese comrades even eat
their food in a unique style.

1130
01:21:42,964 --> 01:21:46,263
Yes. But looks like she has food
for the first time. Got a good speed.

1131
01:21:46,635 --> 01:21:47,602
Don't say that.

1132
01:21:47,802 --> 01:21:50,270
Since she has no time to waste
she must be hurrying.

1133
01:21:51,473 --> 01:21:53,634
I have brought the Chit fund book.

1134
01:21:53,842 --> 01:21:55,275
Take God's name and sign here.

1135
01:21:56,311 --> 01:21:56,902
Here take this pen.

1136
01:22:05,053 --> 01:22:07,681
Ok. Then that matter is done.

1137
01:22:07,889 --> 01:22:08,947
Now come to the topic.

1138
01:22:09,157 --> 01:22:10,988
Which topic? You tell me.
I will ask her.

1139
01:22:12,527 --> 01:22:15,963
How far has communism
gone in China?

1140
01:22:16,164 --> 01:22:18,530
Will it immediately overtake the U.S. Or...
...will take some more time? Ask her.

1141
01:22:19,935 --> 01:22:20,833
Ask her.

1142
01:22:23,038 --> 01:22:27,668
If it is 5 pm in China then
what will be the time in America?

1143
01:22:28,410 --> 01:22:29,138
5 O' clock

1144
01:22:30,111 --> 01:22:31,408
Did she say it will take five years?

1145
01:22:31,613 --> 01:22:32,204
Yes. Yes.

1146
01:22:32,414 --> 01:22:35,577
She said in five years China...
...will overtake the U.S.

1147
01:22:39,621 --> 01:22:41,816
In order drive away such evil forces...

1148
01:22:42,090 --> 01:22:48,893
...we are supporting our traditional
enemy Congress only from outside.

1149
01:22:49,364 --> 01:22:51,696
Only from outside.

1150
01:22:52,033 --> 01:22:55,298
Hence China is not angry with me isn't it?

1151
01:22:58,707 --> 01:23:01,676
Ask her if she knows about
the comrades from Kerala.

1152
01:23:01,876 --> 01:23:02,535
Ask her.

1153
01:23:02,944 --> 01:23:06,573
I heard you people eat worms. Is it true?

1154
01:23:07,015 --> 01:23:10,746
Yes, we eat only clean worms.

1155
01:23:11,219 --> 01:23:16,623
Silk worm, worms in Rose...
beetles all these are good to ate.

1156
01:23:17,058 --> 01:23:17,786
The jokes of this girl.

1157
01:23:18,026 --> 01:23:18,856
What did she say?

1158
01:23:19,160 --> 01:23:23,529
She says she knows all the Malayalee...
...Communist leaders.

1159
01:23:23,698 --> 01:23:26,724
Comrades, A.K. G, E.M. S
Krishna Pillai, Nayanar...

1160
01:23:26,968 --> 01:23:30,131
...are all like fore fathers for her.

1161
01:23:31,106 --> 01:23:31,834
It is?

1162
01:23:32,407 --> 01:23:33,135
Yes.

1163
01:23:35,276 --> 01:23:36,743
Do you know Achundanandan?

1164
01:23:39,080 --> 01:23:40,638
Opposition. Opposition.

1165
01:23:44,085 --> 01:23:46,417
Do you know Pinarayi?

1166
01:23:49,858 --> 01:23:53,885
There is no such problem as
enemies think about them.

1167
01:23:54,095 --> 01:23:56,689
Friends. No problem.

1168
01:23:57,599 --> 01:23:59,396
No problem. Friends.

1169
01:24:00,535 --> 01:24:01,467
Very good friends.

1170
01:24:13,748 --> 01:24:16,342
Yes. How much is it?
- Twenty five.

1171
01:24:16,551 --> 01:24:21,113
Get out. You cheat. Idiot.
Trying to fool me?

1172
01:24:21,322 --> 01:24:22,516
Sorry madam.

1173
01:24:23,324 --> 01:24:26,054
No rent. No room.
Get lost. Go.

1174
01:24:36,071 --> 01:24:39,529
What? No room.

1175
01:24:49,751 --> 01:24:53,551
No cry, come. Come.

1176
01:25:09,270 --> 01:25:11,898
This is a Chinese woman.

1177
01:25:12,173 --> 01:25:15,734
Looks like she is driven out
since she did not pay the rent.

1178
01:25:15,944 --> 01:25:18,742
If Maya, can help she can
get an accommodation.

1179
01:25:20,281 --> 01:25:23,739
Since your dad's is
a right wing communist...

1180
01:25:23,952 --> 01:25:25,749
...I know that you are more
sympathetic with Russia.

1181
01:25:25,954 --> 01:25:28,752
Yet you must remember that China too
is communist country.

1182
01:25:29,424 --> 01:25:31,790
What is the connection between
you and this Chinese woman?

1183
01:25:32,293 --> 01:25:37,253
Since olden times there is a relation
between China and Kerala isn't it?

1184
01:25:37,465 --> 01:25:39,092
Chinese nets, China clay dishes.

1185
01:25:39,300 --> 01:25:39,925
Hence?

1186
01:25:40,201 --> 01:25:43,432
Nothing, but if you help it will
be an obligation.

1187
01:25:43,972 --> 01:25:46,941
Temporarily I will keep her with me.

1188
01:25:47,208 --> 01:25:49,768
But without knowing details
about this girl...

1189
01:25:49,978 --> 01:25:52,446
About that I take full responsibility.
There won't be any trouble.

1190
01:25:52,981 --> 01:25:55,279
Balan teacher. Russian communist.

1191
01:25:55,483 --> 01:25:56,950
Daughter Maya. No problem.

1192
01:25:57,218 --> 01:25:59,778
But at the place where
I stay the rent is more.

1193
01:25:59,988 --> 01:26:01,615
However much is the rent I will give.

1194
01:26:01,823 --> 01:26:04,621
First you tell her the matter
and comfort her.

1195
01:26:07,162 --> 01:26:08,629
She doesn't have any one else.

1196
01:26:18,806 --> 01:26:20,603
Don't worry I will find a bed for you.

1197
01:26:22,744 --> 01:26:24,712
Mukundan will pay the rent

1198
01:26:25,246 --> 01:26:26,213
Is it true?

1199
01:26:32,820 --> 01:26:34,788
Thank you very much.

1200
01:26:49,537 --> 01:26:53,337
Then everything as I said.
There is no one at the shop.

1201
01:27:02,383 --> 01:27:06,513
Interval... before China invades Kerala

1202
01:27:28,643 --> 01:27:31,612
Don't you have to get up in
the morning and go to work?

1203
01:27:31,813 --> 01:27:34,441
Haven't you finished writing
all nonsense about your place?

1204
01:27:34,649 --> 01:27:36,617
This to be sent for a competition.

1205
01:27:36,818 --> 01:27:41,118
Last year's award, due to the grudges
of the committee people, I missed it.

1206
01:27:42,290 --> 01:27:43,484
Why you have kept your hand like this?

1207
01:27:43,691 --> 01:27:44,658
Have a chest pain?

1208
01:27:44,959 --> 01:27:48,326
Take care. Last year
Kunju Kader went home.

1209
01:27:48,529 --> 01:27:49,826
He had such a heart pain.

1210
01:27:50,365 --> 01:27:52,162
He said it was gas and
did not take care.

1211
01:27:52,433 --> 01:27:53,832
He did not get up.

1212
01:27:54,035 --> 01:27:56,162
There are many types
of pains isn't it?

1213
01:27:56,704 --> 01:27:58,001
This is different.

1214
01:27:59,207 --> 01:28:01,835
This a heartache which has pleasure.

1215
01:28:14,555 --> 01:28:21,188
Comrade, just open the curtain let me
atleast see a bit of the sky.

1216
01:29:10,044 --> 01:29:15,846
"At the horizon the flowers
of our wishes will bloom."

1217
01:29:16,050 --> 01:29:22,011
"Where is the garden where
never withering flowers bloom?

1218
01:29:22,290 --> 01:29:24,520
"Let us go and harvest."

1219
01:29:24,726 --> 01:29:27,854
"I will give you company."

1220
01:29:28,062 --> 01:29:33,864
"Is there a sickle like the
moon in the sky?"

1221
01:29:34,235 --> 01:29:40,037
"The bangles make a noise
when I cut the harvest."

1222
01:30:13,608 --> 01:30:19,569
"Even if I don't sleep or
if I am sleep..."

1223
01:30:19,781 --> 01:30:22,579
"...you are in my day dreams."

1224
01:30:22,784 --> 01:30:25,082
"You are the red star in that dream."

1225
01:30:25,453 --> 01:30:31,255
"The magic of your love
makes me smile."

1226
01:30:31,459 --> 01:30:36,920
"The white moon makes me sleepless."

1227
01:30:37,131 --> 01:30:39,759
"You are the woman
from a place I like."

1228
01:30:39,967 --> 01:30:42,765
"I can see your red face
in darkness too."

1229
01:30:42,970 --> 01:30:45,438
"Let us go round alone
in the boat for rides."

1230
01:30:45,640 --> 01:30:49,269
"Let us sing loves song there."

1231
01:30:49,477 --> 01:30:54,938
"Come with me,
give me company."

1232
01:30:55,149 --> 01:31:01,110
"At the horizon the flowers
of our wishes will bloom."

1233
01:31:01,389 --> 01:31:07,453
"Where is the garden where the never
withering flowers bloom?

1234
01:31:31,519 --> 01:31:36,980
"I am speechless and stunned..."

1235
01:31:37,191 --> 01:31:43,494
"...When I and you are alone
and in love."

1236
01:31:43,698 --> 01:31:49,659
"Even the winds around
sing in lilting tunes."

1237
01:31:49,871 --> 01:31:55,002
"And it brings the fragrance
of flowers with it."

1238
01:31:55,209 --> 01:31:57,677
"Love drips from your eyes."

1239
01:31:58,212 --> 01:32:00,680
"You lovely girls I am in
love with you."

1240
01:32:01,215 --> 01:32:04,013
"The one who is always
in my sweet dreams."

1241
01:32:04,218 --> 01:32:07,346
"I will make a garland and
put it on your neck."

1242
01:32:07,555 --> 01:32:13,187
"Come with me, give me company."

1243
01:32:13,461 --> 01:32:19,024
"At the horizon the flowers
of our wishes will bloom."

1244
01:32:19,233 --> 01:32:25,194
"Where is the garden where the never
withering flowers bloom?

1245
01:32:25,573 --> 01:32:27,700
"Let us go and harvest."

1246
01:32:28,075 --> 01:32:31,203
"I will give you company."

1247
01:32:31,479 --> 01:32:37,042
"Is there a sickle like the
moon in the sky?"

1248
01:32:37,251 --> 01:32:43,212
"The bangles make a noise
when I cut the harvest."

1249
01:33:09,884 --> 01:33:10,851
Hey. Mukundan

1250
01:33:12,053 --> 01:33:13,179
What happened, Mukundan?

1251
01:33:13,888 --> 01:33:17,016
What happened?
- Nothing.

1252
01:33:22,063 --> 01:33:24,031
Hello. Yes, I got it.

1253
01:33:25,266 --> 01:33:27,029
It is our sister Maya.

1254
01:33:30,404 --> 01:33:31,200
Hello, Maya...

1255
01:33:31,806 --> 01:33:37,540
Yes, Mukundan nothing very serious
our Chinese comrade fell down.

1256
01:33:37,745 --> 01:33:40,873
What? It is a great wonder.

1257
01:33:41,082 --> 01:33:42,709
I too just fell down.

1258
01:33:43,084 --> 01:33:44,551
Did that girl too fall down now?

1259
01:33:44,752 --> 01:33:46,720
If it is so, then we both
fell down together.

1260
01:33:46,921 --> 01:33:48,889
Hey, it was yesterday.

1261
01:33:49,590 --> 01:33:52,058
When I saw in the morning,
I saw a little wound.

1262
01:33:52,259 --> 01:33:53,886
I just took her to the doctor
and am returning.

1263
01:33:54,428 --> 01:33:57,056
Nothing serious.
Just a little wound.

1264
01:33:57,498 --> 01:33:58,556
Where are you both now?

1265
01:33:58,766 --> 01:34:00,893
We are at the road next
to the creek.

1266
01:34:01,102 --> 01:34:02,569
The way to my room.

1267
01:34:03,104 --> 01:34:05,072
I just informed, Mukundan.

1268
01:34:05,606 --> 01:34:06,732
Just do one thing.

1269
01:34:06,941 --> 01:34:07,908
That be there, I will come right now.

1270
01:34:08,309 --> 01:34:11,005
Hey, no. Mukundan
need not come.

1271
01:34:11,245 --> 01:34:13,713
I want to come. I am coming.
I will come.

1272
01:34:17,785 --> 01:34:18,752
What happened, Mukundan?

1273
01:34:18,953 --> 01:34:20,921
A serious accident,
I will come now.

1274
01:34:21,122 --> 01:34:22,248
Accident? Where?

1275
01:34:22,523 --> 01:34:23,421
I will return and tell you all.

1276
01:34:35,336 --> 01:34:36,268
Hey, here. Here.

1277
01:34:42,009 --> 01:34:47,140
Hey, her hand. What happened?

1278
01:34:47,348 --> 01:34:48,815
Actually what happened?

1279
01:34:49,850 --> 01:34:53,308
You fall, I morning fall. Very pain.

1280
01:34:55,556 --> 01:34:56,989
Ask her if it is very painful?

1281
01:34:57,191 --> 01:34:59,318
Did I not tell you over the phone that
it is nothing to worry about?

1282
01:34:59,527 --> 01:35:00,494
Then why are you so tensed?

1283
01:35:00,761 --> 01:35:03,491
If anything happens to China,
then Kerala, cannot bear it.

1284
01:35:03,764 --> 01:35:06,324
Then it is an international communist
meet isn't it?

1285
01:35:06,867 --> 01:35:11,167
I never expected that there will such
a connection between dream and reality.

1286
01:35:11,372 --> 01:35:12,498
Which dream?

1287
01:35:12,873 --> 01:35:15,000
That is a different dream.

1288
01:35:15,209 --> 01:35:19,168
Since I rushed when I came in hurry
I did not buy anything.

1289
01:35:19,380 --> 01:35:20,176
What to buy?

1290
01:35:20,381 --> 01:35:22,849
When one comes to see a sick person
should not one get something.

1291
01:35:23,050 --> 01:35:24,347
I will go and bring some
apple or orange.

1292
01:35:24,552 --> 01:35:25,678
Hey nothing is wanted.

1293
01:35:25,886 --> 01:35:27,012
Even if needed I will buy and give her,

1294
01:35:27,221 --> 01:35:29,849
And say that you got it for her.
- That too will do.

1295
01:35:30,224 --> 01:35:34,854
If we get some herbal oil
from our place and give?

1296
01:35:36,731 --> 01:35:37,857
What do you want to do?

1297
01:35:38,065 --> 01:35:40,693
It is good for such hits,
wounds and scalds.

1298
01:35:41,235 --> 01:35:42,532
I did not ask that.

1299
01:35:42,803 --> 01:35:45,533
Even when I said don't come
why did you run and come?

1300
01:35:45,806 --> 01:35:50,038
That...
- I understood it.

1301
01:35:50,411 --> 01:35:51,537
What did you understand?

1302
01:35:51,812 --> 01:35:54,372
Tell me what you want to tell her.
I will tell her.

1303
01:35:54,582 --> 01:35:55,708
Shall I get apple for her?

1304
01:35:55,916 --> 01:35:59,215
Let the apple be there.
Answer my question...

1305
01:35:59,420 --> 01:36:01,388
Shall I tell her what all you said?

1306
01:36:01,589 --> 01:36:05,389
Hey, don't. If there is
such things to say...

1307
01:36:05,593 --> 01:36:08,721
...I will say it personally. Isn't that correct?
And also pleasurable?

1308
01:36:08,929 --> 01:36:10,897
In which language will
Mukundan say that?

1309
01:36:11,098 --> 01:36:15,432
That... Maya can teach me how to say
all that in Chinese.

1310
01:36:15,970 --> 01:36:18,063
It is getting for me to go to work.

1311
01:36:20,608 --> 01:36:21,404
You come with me.

1312
01:36:46,300 --> 01:36:48,097
Nambiar sir, Siddharthan has come.

1313
01:36:48,302 --> 01:36:49,769
He is going to pick the name of this
month's choice for the chit fund.

1314
01:36:50,137 --> 01:36:52,935
Didn't you see?
My coat is not yet dried.

1315
01:36:53,140 --> 01:36:54,437
Hey whom to show that sir?

1316
01:36:54,642 --> 01:36:56,610
Come, this time you may be lucky.

1317
01:36:56,877 --> 01:37:02,281
Me? Chit fund? If I did have such luck
would I be lying this here?

1318
01:37:08,689 --> 01:37:09,781
Hey, who is it?

1319
01:37:09,990 --> 01:37:13,790
After staying such a long time with you all
I did not see such a scene?

1320
01:37:13,994 --> 01:37:16,792
That coat must be crying right now.

1321
01:37:16,997 --> 01:37:19,124
Isn't this the first time in life
it is away from him?

1322
01:37:20,501 --> 01:37:24,301
Sirish, you pick up one chit.
Pick my name.

1323
01:37:25,005 --> 01:37:27,303
Third daughter's husband
has asked for...

1324
01:37:27,508 --> 01:37:30,306
...imported Fridge and TV.

1325
01:37:30,711 --> 01:37:33,145
My daughter is not that fair.

1326
01:37:33,347 --> 01:37:36,475
Fridge and TV, here the house work
is not over yet.

1327
01:37:36,851 --> 01:37:41,311
If my name comes then I will pour
the next floor and finish the work.

1328
01:37:41,856 --> 01:37:42,823
God.

1329
01:37:45,926 --> 01:37:46,984
All see.

1330
01:37:47,361 --> 01:37:48,828
Who is the lucky man?

1331
01:37:51,031 --> 01:37:51,827
Who is it?

1332
01:37:53,701 --> 01:37:55,669
It is Mukundan.
- Who me?

1333
01:37:58,539 --> 01:38:02,498
It is good. He is the most
needy among all.

1334
01:38:02,710 --> 01:38:05,008
I can repay the loan upto
three fourth the amount.

1335
01:38:05,212 --> 01:38:07,180
What I sent so far is gone
in interest itself.

1336
01:38:07,381 --> 01:38:09,849
Then I will bring the cash
within a week.

1337
01:38:11,085 --> 01:38:12,677
You don't worry.

1338
01:38:12,953 --> 01:38:15,353
I have a person in the new showroom.

1339
01:38:15,556 --> 01:38:19,356
We can arrange to send TV
or Fridge from here itself.

1340
01:38:19,560 --> 01:38:21,357
Now son in law should not get
angry without these.

1341
01:38:27,902 --> 01:38:29,369
God.

1342
01:38:36,243 --> 01:38:37,210
Mukundan.

1343
01:38:37,978 --> 01:38:39,707
Which goon?
- Mukundan.

1344
01:38:40,080 --> 01:38:45,541
Mukundan, he is go. God.

1345
01:38:45,786 --> 01:38:51,224
Room cleaning every day, one man.

1346
01:38:51,592 --> 01:38:54,220
This cleaning Mukundan.

1347
01:38:54,428 --> 01:38:58,728
Cleaning, water, soap powder,
broom, cleaning...

1348
01:38:59,266 --> 01:39:00,233
Mukundan.

1349
01:39:00,434 --> 01:39:01,059
What?

1350
01:39:02,770 --> 01:39:05,898
Oh Shanmu? He is going on leave
in December.

1351
01:39:07,107 --> 01:39:08,074
Mukundan.

1352
01:39:08,342 --> 01:39:12,403
Oh. My dear sister... God how will I make
her understand?

1353
01:39:12,613 --> 01:39:16,071
Mukundan. No come. No come.

1354
01:39:16,283 --> 01:39:19,411
You go. And Mukundan come.
You come.

1355
01:39:23,457 --> 01:39:25,755
Oh, God. I am saved.

1356
01:39:28,462 --> 01:39:31,761
God, this China pot will
take me and go, I feel.

1357
01:39:32,032 --> 01:39:34,592
Now she should not come again
with some doubt.

1358
01:39:38,973 --> 01:39:39,598
Where is, Mukundan?

1359
01:39:39,807 --> 01:39:42,275
Mukundan, is... Hey it is you.

1360
01:39:42,476 --> 01:39:44,774
Today is Mukundan's duty
for cleaning the room.

1361
01:39:45,045 --> 01:39:45,943
He will be late to come.

1362
01:39:46,146 --> 01:39:48,444
You just tell this China Pot here
and make her understand.

1363
01:39:58,659 --> 01:40:00,126
Karim, call Mukundan on the phone.

1364
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:09,128
Mukundan, it is me. I had brought
the Chit fund money.

1365
01:40:10,070 --> 01:40:12,630
No I have to go to Jabel Ali
for an important work.

1366
01:40:12,840 --> 01:40:14,808
I thought Mukundan will be here.

1367
01:40:15,075 --> 01:40:16,303
Karim is here.

1368
01:40:16,510 --> 01:40:19,138
Don't give in his hands.
- Ok.

1369
01:40:20,180 --> 01:40:24,480
Then Chinese woman has
come here to see you.

1370
01:40:25,853 --> 01:40:26,649
Is it?

1371
01:40:26,854 --> 01:40:28,651
Yes. Shall I give her and
send it to you.

1372
01:40:28,856 --> 01:40:30,824
You can confidently send it with her.

1373
01:40:31,091 --> 01:40:34,993
She knows where I stay.
- Ok. Ok.

1374
01:40:35,696 --> 01:40:37,323
What a joke.

1375
01:40:38,432 --> 01:40:40,332
Count this and see.
- Why?

1376
01:40:40,534 --> 01:40:43,662
I need a witness.
He told to send the money with her.

1377
01:40:51,045 --> 01:40:52,012
80000 Dirhams.

1378
01:40:52,212 --> 01:40:53,179
Here is 2000 more.

1379
01:40:53,380 --> 01:40:55,348
Then it is 82000 dirhams.

1380
01:40:55,549 --> 01:40:57,176
That is in India it is 10 lakhs.
- Yes.

1381
01:40:57,384 --> 01:40:58,851
Then give it here.

1382
01:41:00,721 --> 01:41:03,349
Mukundan is waiting for you.
Give this cash to him.

1383
01:41:27,081 --> 01:41:28,878
Okay.
- Thank you.

1384
01:41:32,086 --> 01:41:36,045
Karim, get me some of your special
Chicken fry & two breads for me.

1385
01:41:36,256 --> 01:41:38,224
You just said You had to
urgently go to Jabel Ali.

1386
01:41:38,425 --> 01:41:39,892
Who said?
- You said.

1387
01:41:40,160 --> 01:41:41,718
Yes, Jabel Ali, isn't it?

1388
01:41:41,929 --> 01:41:46,229
After having come so far can I go without having
your special Ginger chicken fry?

1389
01:41:46,433 --> 01:41:50,392
This is the first time in my life a person
said my cooking is good.

1390
01:41:50,604 --> 01:41:51,901
Today I will kill you in the pot.

1391
01:42:45,659 --> 01:42:46,785
What she did not come so far?

1392
01:42:47,661 --> 01:42:51,620
Siddharthan is here. Yes.

1393
01:42:52,332 --> 01:42:53,299
It is Mukundan.

1394
01:42:53,834 --> 01:42:54,801
It seems that girl has not come so far.

1395
01:42:55,002 --> 01:42:57,129
What? Did not reach?

1396
01:42:57,504 --> 01:42:58,471
God! She duped us?

1397
01:43:03,177 --> 01:43:04,144
Where is she? Su Min?

1398
01:43:04,344 --> 01:43:05,811
She went back her country.

1399
01:43:06,013 --> 01:43:07,139
What? Went back home?
- Yes.

1400
01:43:07,347 --> 01:43:10,145
Her flight must have taken off
half an hour before.

1401
01:43:10,350 --> 01:43:11,647
What? What is the problem

1402
01:43:11,852 --> 01:43:14,980
She duped. She ran away with
the Mukundan's Chit fund money.

1403
01:43:15,255 --> 01:43:17,485
She? Hey, she won't do
any such thing.

1404
01:43:18,192 --> 01:43:19,159
Is it true?

1405
01:43:19,359 --> 01:43:20,485
Why blame her?

1406
01:43:20,694 --> 01:43:23,162
When he told me to give the money
with her I too did so.

1407
01:43:23,363 --> 01:43:25,831
It was good that Karim was
a witness to this.

1408
01:43:26,033 --> 01:43:27,159
Or else I would have been blamed
for stealing the money.

1409
01:43:30,370 --> 01:43:32,838
In the morning we stepped out
together from the room.

1410
01:43:33,273 --> 01:43:35,332
She had not said anything
about going home then.

1411
01:43:35,542 --> 01:43:38,340
At about 10 am she called
and asked for a loan.

1412
01:43:38,545 --> 01:43:40,513
I did not have money
immediately to give her.

1413
01:43:40,714 --> 01:43:44,844
Then after an hour when she called again
she said she got the money...

1414
01:43:45,052 --> 01:43:47,020
...and said that she is going home.
But...

1415
01:43:47,287 --> 01:43:51,018
Now did you understand?
The actual color of your comrades?

1416
01:43:51,291 --> 01:43:54,021
They send all duplicate items
through out the world.

1417
01:43:55,395 --> 01:43:56,692
She too is a duplicate.

1418
01:43:56,897 --> 01:43:59,195
A duplicate not worth more than
a one quarter of rupee.

1419
01:44:11,245 --> 01:44:13,042
Do you feel better now?

1420
01:44:13,313 --> 01:44:14,211
Want to go to hospital?

1421
01:44:26,760 --> 01:44:30,560
What? What happened?
- Feel very weak.

1422
01:44:30,764 --> 01:44:35,064
Today the Arab who is the building owner
has asked me to come to his office.

1423
01:44:35,335 --> 01:44:37,064
Why? Did he increase the rent again?

1424
01:44:37,337 --> 01:44:38,235
Not that.

1425
01:44:38,438 --> 01:44:43,899
He has given a notice to vacate our shop
as quickly as possible.

1426
01:44:45,112 --> 01:44:48,912
A big project is coming at that place.

1427
01:44:49,116 --> 01:44:51,744
It is a prime place in Dubai.

1428
01:44:51,952 --> 01:44:55,251
A small cafeteria at that place
is of no use to him.

1429
01:44:56,290 --> 01:44:58,588
We all have become useless things.

1430
01:45:01,795 --> 01:45:03,092
Don't be troubled.

1431
01:45:03,363 --> 01:45:05,763
We will see some other place.

1432
01:45:05,966 --> 01:45:08,093
Or there must some other way too.

1433
01:45:08,368 --> 01:45:09,767
Now if we have to get such a place...

1434
01:45:09,970 --> 01:45:11,938
...we will have to give
five times the rent.

1435
01:45:12,306 --> 01:45:15,104
To even pay the rent we will have to
start some dance bar.

1436
01:45:16,643 --> 01:45:21,273
Maybe God's will must that
it should end like this.

1437
01:45:22,482 --> 01:45:28,114
I had come here to stay for 4 or 5 years
and solve the family's problems.

1438
01:45:28,388 --> 01:45:34,793
Now it is 34 years, now I can't think
of anything else.

1439
01:45:34,995 --> 01:45:37,293
I have to vacate the place soon.

1440
01:45:37,998 --> 01:45:40,296
Those who can stay can do so.

1441
01:45:40,500 --> 01:45:42,627
Or else can go back home.

1442
01:45:43,670 --> 01:45:46,798
Only that we can do isn't it?

1443
01:46:00,854 --> 01:46:02,321
Hey, you are lying down here?

1444
01:46:04,024 --> 01:46:05,651
Don't you know Abdulla, is going?

1445
01:46:05,859 --> 01:46:06,826
He is asking for you.

1446
01:46:25,112 --> 01:46:28,411
Though this going and coming
is going on for long,

1447
01:46:28,682 --> 01:46:32,083
even now I am tensed
while traveling.

1448
01:46:32,686 --> 01:46:35,086
Here is your passport and ticket.
Keep it carefully.

1449
01:46:35,689 --> 01:46:37,247
Where has Mukundan gone?

1450
01:46:38,959 --> 01:46:40,927
Doesn't he know it is time
for the flight?

1451
01:46:42,295 --> 01:46:43,262
There he is.

1452
01:46:47,634 --> 01:46:48,931
Where were you so long?

1453
01:46:51,304 --> 01:46:54,273
All that is happening
is unexpected.

1454
01:46:54,808 --> 01:47:01,441
I will never forget you.
I will never forget you.

1455
01:47:03,150 --> 01:47:04,617
You are a very good man?

1456
01:47:09,756 --> 01:47:12,122
Why do you cry son?
God will save you.

1457
01:47:48,061 --> 01:47:49,756
My dear countrymen
and friends...

1458
01:47:49,963 --> 01:47:53,763
...our son of Chemmannoor,
Minister Karunan...

1459
01:47:53,967 --> 01:47:58,768
...is accepting his post tomorrow.

1460
01:47:59,139 --> 01:48:06,102
I here by request one and all
to take part in the function.

1461
01:48:12,886 --> 01:48:16,447
I am Krishna Warrior, I am the Manager
of the Co Operative bank.

1462
01:48:16,656 --> 01:48:18,954
Minister's close friend.
Please connect me to him.

1463
01:48:31,838 --> 01:48:34,807
How many days I am trying for
comrade in the mobile?

1464
01:48:35,008 --> 01:48:37,306
For a full week I am making some
excuse and am holding off.

1465
01:48:38,178 --> 01:48:40,305
When the Society people
repaid the loan...

1466
01:48:40,580 --> 01:48:43,140
...are asking for the cheque
given as security.

1467
01:48:43,850 --> 01:48:45,647
Now from where will I take
it and give?

1468
01:48:46,520 --> 01:48:47,612
Come inside.

1469
01:48:50,023 --> 01:48:52,321
For five minutes, all of you
please be outside.

1470
01:49:04,037 --> 01:49:05,664
I gave excuses like Cheque
is misplaced...

1471
01:49:05,939 --> 01:49:07,998
...I will search for it etc.

1472
01:49:08,208 --> 01:49:09,675
They have a doubt now.

1473
01:49:10,043 --> 01:49:11,670
Then they want to see the
cheque with which...

1474
01:49:11,878 --> 01:49:13,675
Society Gopalan, withdrew
the money.

1475
01:49:13,880 --> 01:49:16,849
They have the number of the cheque
given as security to the bank.

1476
01:49:17,217 --> 01:49:19,014
If they come to know both
are the same then.

1477
01:49:19,219 --> 01:49:20,686
What is the way out?

1478
01:49:21,054 --> 01:49:25,514
I have to agree that I did that
as per your instructions.

1479
01:49:25,725 --> 01:49:27,693
Comrade should talk to them...

1480
01:49:27,894 --> 01:49:29,691
...and somehow get me
out of this mess.

1481
01:49:29,896 --> 01:49:34,526
I should talk? It is only 5 days
after I took oath as a minister.

1482
01:49:34,734 --> 01:49:36,861
If I talk then it will mean that...

1483
01:49:37,070 --> 01:49:40,528
...I am involved in it too.

1484
01:49:40,740 --> 01:49:43,709
If so what will be my condition
in the cabinet and the party?

1485
01:49:44,110 --> 01:49:46,544
Even otherwise, I have many
enemies in the party.

1486
01:49:46,913 --> 01:49:48,210
Do one thing.

1487
01:49:48,582 --> 01:49:50,209
Just say it was all a mistake,

1488
01:49:50,417 --> 01:49:53,215
say that... we will return the
amount which Mukundan sent.

1489
01:49:53,653 --> 01:49:55,211
What does comrade say?

1490
01:49:55,422 --> 01:49:59,381
Can extremists like Anwar,
be brushed off like that?

1491
01:49:59,926 --> 01:50:02,895
His favorite leader Mukundan
had to go away...

1492
01:50:03,096 --> 01:50:04,222
...due to this problem, isn't it?

1493
01:50:04,431 --> 01:50:05,898
You talk to them and see.

1494
01:50:06,099 --> 01:50:07,566
Comrade should speak.

1495
01:50:07,767 --> 01:50:10,895
If I say this they will
beat me and kill me.

1496
01:50:11,104 --> 01:50:13,572
Under no condition
I can get into this mess.

1497
01:50:14,274 --> 01:50:15,741
Didn't I do it on your instructions?

1498
01:50:15,942 --> 01:50:18,410
There is no proof for that, isn't it?
- That means...

1499
01:50:18,678 --> 01:50:20,908
Think on your own and
do something man.

1500
01:50:21,114 --> 01:50:22,240
I have thousands of problems now.

1501
01:50:22,449 --> 01:50:23,916
Tomorrow's function is pressing.

1502
01:50:24,284 --> 01:50:25,581
We will see later.

1503
01:50:32,292 --> 01:50:35,090
It is a rule of warfare no to shoot
a surrendered man.

1504
01:50:35,495 --> 01:50:38,430
That is the only reason that I am not
crushing this dirty fellow...

1505
01:50:38,798 --> 01:50:43,258
Comrade Karunan is enjoying and
our beloved is struggling somewhere.

1506
01:50:43,470 --> 01:50:45,938
We have to immediately let all people
concerned know of this scam.

1507
01:50:46,139 --> 01:50:48,107
We should file a betrayal case
against Warriors.

1508
01:50:48,475 --> 01:50:51,603
Not only that, all the comrades
in Chemmannoor who love the party,

1509
01:50:51,811 --> 01:50:54,439
should not partake in today's Minister
Karunan's function today.

1510
01:50:54,714 --> 01:50:56,113
It is not a proper action.

1511
01:50:56,316 --> 01:50:58,443
Due to hard work of our party workers...

1512
01:50:58,718 --> 01:51:00,948
...we have got power with majority.

1513
01:51:01,154 --> 01:51:03,122
We got a minister too in,
Chemmammoor too.

1514
01:51:03,523 --> 01:51:05,957
Just believing what a bank
manager says...

1515
01:51:06,159 --> 01:51:08,957
...boycotting the Minister's function
is not the right action.

1516
01:51:09,162 --> 01:51:12,290
Whether minister or any one else has
to be punished if he has done wrong.

1517
01:51:12,832 --> 01:51:14,299
Now if you get this mess out...

1518
01:51:14,501 --> 01:51:16,128
...it will defame the party
and our government.

1519
01:51:16,336 --> 01:51:18,133
The opposition will take the advantage...

1520
01:51:18,338 --> 01:51:19,134
...and go full swing against us on this.

1521
01:51:19,339 --> 01:51:21,807
Let them. Only if the thieves
in the party...

1522
01:51:22,008 --> 01:51:23,305
...is thrown out then the
party will be clean.

1523
01:51:23,510 --> 01:51:25,637
Neither Chemmannoor nor the party
needs such a minister.

1524
01:51:25,845 --> 01:51:27,472
Only Comrade deciding on
that isn't enough.

1525
01:51:27,847 --> 01:51:30,975
Who said this is only Anwar's decision?

1526
01:51:32,519 --> 01:51:37,149
You forgot the honest party man
known as Society Gopalan.

1527
01:51:38,024 --> 01:51:40,322
He died very badly.

1528
01:51:41,194 --> 01:51:44,322
At one time, Gopalan was the party here.

1529
01:51:44,531 --> 01:51:45,657
The man who plotted against him...

1530
01:51:45,865 --> 01:51:48,493
...should not stay in the party
even for a minute.

1531
01:51:48,768 --> 01:51:50,326
Don't tell us old stories sir.

1532
01:51:50,537 --> 01:51:52,334
At this point you don't know
the position of the party.

1533
01:51:52,539 --> 01:51:53,836
Party is supreme for us.

1534
01:51:54,040 --> 01:51:56,167
The most Supreme is the people.

1535
01:51:56,376 --> 01:51:59,174
The Party is made for the
people by the people.

1536
01:51:59,379 --> 01:52:01,506
Only deserving people need stay in it.

1537
01:52:02,048 --> 01:52:04,016
The beggar is some one's agent.

1538
01:52:04,217 --> 01:52:07,516
He has been purposely sent to
defame Minister Karunan's name.

1539
01:52:07,787 --> 01:52:09,345
Do you have any proof that the Minister
told you to do this?

1540
01:52:12,726 --> 01:52:14,853
We will break your limbs
if you lie to us.

1541
01:52:16,563 --> 01:52:25,028
Minister Karunan, the son of the soil is coming
in the vehicle take part in the function.

1542
01:52:25,238 --> 01:52:28,537
Come and welcome him.
Bless him.

1543
01:52:28,808 --> 01:52:30,207
Let this function get over.

1544
01:52:30,410 --> 01:52:34,039
He has come here for the function
all the people welcome

1545
01:52:34,247 --> 01:52:39,879
and bless our son of the soil,
Minister Karunan the great from our place.

1546
01:52:49,763 --> 01:52:51,731
Minister Karunan congrats.

1547
01:52:52,766 --> 01:53:02,073
Minister Karunan congrats.

1548
01:53:02,442 --> 01:53:04,239
Congrats to Chemmannor.

1549
01:53:04,444 --> 01:53:06,071
Congrats to Chemmannor.

1550
01:53:06,946 --> 01:53:10,074
Anyway we have to give
the information to Secretariat.

1551
01:53:10,784 --> 01:53:13,252
I don't think that will be of
any use by that.

1552
01:53:13,953 --> 01:53:16,922
What proof is there
to blame, Karunan?

1553
01:53:17,123 --> 01:53:18,920
Manager Worrier's statement is proof.

1554
01:53:19,125 --> 01:53:21,423
When the Party inquires
if Warrior denies then?

1555
01:53:21,961 --> 01:53:24,429
Then Warrior won't be alive.

1556
01:53:24,798 --> 01:53:27,767
If we do that Karunan will be
saved permanently.

1557
01:53:32,806 --> 01:53:36,606
I feel very pained when
I think of Mukundan.

1558
01:53:37,343 --> 01:53:41,279
For no fault of his he is
suffering somewhere.

1559
01:53:41,481 --> 01:53:43,608
Is there any news where he is now?

1560
01:53:44,984 --> 01:53:48,283
Many of my friends in the Gulf
are still looking for him.

1561
01:53:48,488 --> 01:53:50,115
So far no news.

1562
01:53:50,323 --> 01:53:52,450
Friends may not be interested in this.

1563
01:53:52,659 --> 01:53:54,456
We should have gone personally
and look for him.

1564
01:53:54,828 --> 01:53:55,795
Personally means?

1565
01:53:55,995 --> 01:53:57,292
We should go there and
search for him.

1566
01:53:57,497 --> 01:54:02,457
Yes. Why should Mukundan
suffer now in a foreign land?

1567
01:54:02,669 --> 01:54:09,472
What I say is Anwar himself should
go and look for him.

1568
01:54:10,777 --> 01:54:13,143
I had thought of that many times sir.

1569
01:54:13,346 --> 01:54:19,478
But... No. There should not be
any more delay.

1570
01:54:24,357 --> 01:54:29,317
Hello, now where have you reached?
Yes.

1571
01:54:31,030 --> 01:54:33,999
Hello. Hello. Hello.
- Look here.

1572
01:54:38,371 --> 01:54:39,998
I'm Anwar.
- I am Maya.

1573
01:54:40,206 --> 01:54:41,002
Understood.

1574
01:54:41,374 --> 01:54:43,842
Was a little trouble to get the way isn't it?
- Yes, a little.

1575
01:54:44,544 --> 01:54:47,342
I had told mother not to send anything.

1576
01:54:47,547 --> 01:54:50,345
Mother thinks that this Mango Pickle
is not available here.

1577
01:54:50,550 --> 01:54:52,347
Simply at all she troubles people.

1578
01:54:52,552 --> 01:54:54,850
The people at home can show
their love in only these ways.

1579
01:54:55,054 --> 01:54:57,181
Mother had said it will remain for
a long time without getting spoiled.

1580
01:54:57,390 --> 01:54:59,517
In that confidence I delayed so long.
Here take.

1581
01:54:59,726 --> 01:55:00,693
Thank you.

1582
01:55:00,960 --> 01:55:03,019
I was trying to get a driving license.

1583
01:55:03,229 --> 01:55:04,526
Last week I passed the test.

1584
01:55:04,731 --> 01:55:05,698
Did you get a job?

1585
01:55:05,965 --> 01:55:08,195
No. I have seen a second hand pick up.

1586
01:55:08,735 --> 01:55:11,363
To tell you the fact I have not
come here seeking a job.

1587
01:55:11,571 --> 01:55:12,868
I came here in search of a man.

1588
01:55:13,072 --> 01:55:15,870
This job is only to survive till I find him.
That is there is to it.

1589
01:55:16,075 --> 01:55:18,373
Aren't you from Chemmannoor?
- Yes.

1590
01:55:18,778 --> 01:55:20,370
Who did you say you came to search?

1591
01:55:20,580 --> 01:55:23,549
A Mukundan.
He was our party leader.

1592
01:55:23,750 --> 01:55:24,876
He was a very close friend of mine.

1593
01:55:25,084 --> 01:55:28,053
No, he was just like my own brother.

1594
01:55:28,254 --> 01:55:30,552
Since last 3 years we have
no news of him.

1595
01:55:30,757 --> 01:55:32,224
I know Mukundan.

1596
01:55:32,425 --> 01:55:33,722
What? You know Mukundan?

1597
01:55:34,427 --> 01:55:37,055
Maya. Maya come soon.
- Coming.

1598
01:55:39,098 --> 01:55:40,895
Today is a day when we have
more patients.

1599
01:55:41,100 --> 01:55:43,034
Come to Abru in the evening.
- Yes.

1600
01:55:57,650 --> 01:56:03,486
Such innocent and true Malayalee
I have never seen in my Gulf life.

1601
01:56:03,723 --> 01:56:08,683
I could not understand how that girl
deceived a simpleton like Mukundan.

1602
01:56:10,096 --> 01:56:13,588
When Mukundan, stood there stunned with
the shock that she went with the money...

1603
01:56:13,800 --> 01:56:15,893
...to China, that is still in my memory.

1604
01:56:16,069 --> 01:56:18,537
After coming here the first person
I looked for was Siddharthan.

1605
01:56:18,738 --> 01:56:21,536
But I came to know that he was in some
business tour in Europe.

1606
01:56:22,075 --> 01:56:24,543
Then I went to the place
where Mukundan was staying.

1607
01:56:24,744 --> 01:56:26,541
Now a Pakistani family is staying there.

1608
01:56:28,581 --> 01:56:31,880
First the money he was sending
home stopped for a while.

1609
01:56:32,318 --> 01:56:35,048
But for last one year again money
is coming to the bank.

1610
01:56:35,321 --> 01:56:37,221
Money comes through Western Union.

1611
01:56:37,423 --> 01:56:40,881
With that as a clue, I went with Abbas
and inquired in that office.

1612
01:56:41,427 --> 01:56:44,396
But some one else is sending
on Mukundan's name.

1613
01:56:44,597 --> 01:56:48,226
I tried to contact that person,
but could not.

1614
01:56:48,768 --> 01:56:51,737
When I get the vehicle,
I can search a little more easily.

1615
01:56:54,107 --> 01:56:56,735
Mukundan, is there.
He is somewhere.

1616
01:56:57,010 --> 01:57:03,415
I have to find him. Bye.
- Ok.

1617
01:57:08,421 --> 01:57:12,755
Maya. It is four years since
you went home isn't it?

1618
01:57:15,628 --> 01:57:17,425
All your sister's work is done isn't it?

1619
01:57:18,631 --> 01:57:20,258
Now you need not send any
more money home.

1620
01:57:20,466 --> 01:57:21,763
You must see your own things.

1621
01:57:23,803 --> 01:57:26,431
Advise is not mine but your mother's
who told me to tell you this.

1622
01:57:30,977 --> 01:57:35,937
Anwar. I gave you Varghese's number.
Call him. Don't forget.

1623
01:57:43,990 --> 01:57:46,288
Though I changed my place
of stay many times...

1624
01:57:46,492 --> 01:57:49,791
...I could not throw this.
I have not so far opened this.

1625
01:58:11,717 --> 01:58:30,331
Red Salute. Red Salute.
Red Salute. Red Salute.

1626
01:58:33,706 --> 01:58:34,832
I will take only this.

1627
01:58:36,542 --> 01:58:39,010
All who stayed with us
went in different ways.

1628
01:58:39,212 --> 01:58:40,679
Many went back home.

1629
01:58:41,214 --> 01:58:43,682
Now Karim is working
in dance bar here.

1630
01:58:43,883 --> 01:58:46,010
He is a useless man,
but yet meet him and see.

1631
01:58:46,719 --> 01:58:53,784
"Friend, What do the
heartbeat say?"

1632
01:58:54,127 --> 01:58:56,527
Hey you did not have it?

1633
01:58:59,565 --> 01:59:01,192
You did not say anything
about Mukundan.

1634
01:59:02,235 --> 01:59:06,365
When we were together, I and Mukundan
were against each other.

1635
01:59:06,572 --> 01:59:11,874
Nothing he won't allow me to take money
from my own father in law.

1636
01:59:12,145 --> 01:59:14,545
Poor, I understood him
only after he left.

1637
01:59:15,081 --> 01:59:18,881
After that Chinese girl cheated him
I did not see, Mukundan again.

1638
01:59:19,519 --> 01:59:23,979
Some one said that he went to work
in some military canteen in Iraq.

1639
01:59:24,490 --> 01:59:26,458
"Friend, What do the heartbeat say?"

1640
01:59:27,260 --> 01:59:32,220
If that is so, then who knows
what happened to him now?

1641
01:59:32,598 --> 01:59:36,056
No one will know whether he is dead or alive.
"Friend, What do the heartbeat say?"

1642
01:59:43,876 --> 01:59:47,243
But in this world where ever
a bomb is blasted...

1643
01:59:47,446 --> 01:59:55,410
or a plane falls when people are accounted
for there is always a Malayalee there.

1644
01:59:56,155 --> 02:00:01,923
Now when there is no more
news about him...

1645
02:00:02,628 --> 02:00:05,597
Wait. You said you were
a driver, isn't it? - Yes.

1646
02:00:05,798 --> 02:00:07,356
Shall I come with you to
the Market on Friday?

1647
02:00:08,568 --> 02:00:11,264
A small side business.
I will tell you.

1648
02:00:23,916 --> 02:00:26,942
Poor fellow. If he was
in Kerala it self...

1649
02:00:27,153 --> 02:00:29,587
...by now he would have been
some Minister or an MLA.

1650
02:00:30,823 --> 02:00:33,883
To think that he came here
and struggled with us.

1651
02:00:35,595 --> 02:00:40,191
This Minister Karunan whom you talk of
stays in our Hotel when comes to Dubai.

1652
02:00:41,067 --> 02:00:45,470
He does not come here often to
enquire of his fellow countrymen.

1653
02:00:46,505 --> 02:00:53,638
You get to see the other
side of such big people.

1654
02:01:16,469 --> 02:01:18,994
With the date expired bread
what business you are doing?

1655
02:01:19,538 --> 02:01:22,837
Even after two days after the expired date
it doesn't get spoiled for two more days.

1656
02:01:23,042 --> 02:01:24,907
But if you sell at the shops
the police catches.

1657
02:01:25,211 --> 02:01:31,241
Hence I take it to farms
where they grow cattle.

1658
02:01:31,717 --> 02:01:33,184
A service for animals.

1659
02:01:42,395 --> 02:01:46,126
I send the money I get by
selling the bread home.

1660
02:01:46,832 --> 02:01:49,699
It comes of some use
at home for expenses.

1661
02:01:51,103 --> 02:01:53,628
Now only I am there for them.

1662
02:02:16,929 --> 02:02:19,625
Brother, do you need bread
for the cattle?

1663
02:02:20,766 --> 02:02:21,391
I don't know.

1664
02:02:22,435 --> 02:02:24,630
This fellow will talk only
if you catch his legs.

1665
02:02:38,617 --> 02:02:39,413
Mukundan.

1666
02:02:48,961 --> 02:02:49,757
Anwar.

1667
02:02:58,904 --> 02:02:59,598
Mukundan.

1668
02:03:25,097 --> 02:03:26,962
I had lost hopes of seeing you again.

1669
02:03:28,401 --> 02:03:34,033
There is no place where I did not ask about you.
How is Mukundan here?

1670
02:03:34,740 --> 02:03:36,264
For quite some time I am here.

1671
02:03:37,576 --> 02:03:43,037
They had sent me to Gulf. This too is Gulf.
Only it is in far flung area.

1672
02:03:43,916 --> 02:03:45,713
These are trees where money grows

1673
02:03:47,086 --> 02:03:50,886
I water them, graze cattle,
I am pulling on like this.

1674
02:03:52,258 --> 02:03:54,158
How did you get Karim?

1675
02:03:55,528 --> 02:03:57,962
When I was asking about you I met him.

1676
02:03:58,264 --> 02:03:59,492
You did not go to Iraq?

1677
02:04:02,034 --> 02:04:02,898
Come I will tell you.

1678
02:04:11,110 --> 02:04:15,342
I do not know who made that story
that I have gone to Iraq.

1679
02:04:16,449 --> 02:04:19,316
After Abulla left, there was vacuum.

1680
02:04:19,618 --> 02:04:23,315
I decided not to disturb known
people for a job again.

1681
02:04:23,689 --> 02:04:24,986
I roamed about in many places.

1682
02:04:25,524 --> 02:04:28,186
To quench the hunger I did
what everjob I got.

1683
02:04:28,561 --> 02:04:32,861
Sometimes for two, three days
there is no job nor any food.

1684
02:04:33,199 --> 02:04:36,327
In one such situation I only
remember falling unconscious.

1685
02:04:36,569 --> 02:04:39,936
When I came to I was lying
in an Arab's house.

1686
02:04:40,372 --> 02:04:42,932
That man gave me food
and gave me shelter.

1687
02:04:43,576 --> 02:04:49,105
One day he asked me whether I could do
something to get this place in shape.

1688
02:04:53,319 --> 02:04:56,117
After that night and day
I was just working.

1689
02:04:56,822 --> 02:05:01,350
Before in our Chemmannoor
we dug wells and roads.

1690
02:05:02,595 --> 02:05:05,462
I thought this too is Chemmannoor...

1691
02:05:06,332 --> 02:05:10,632
and in these three years
I made this place like this.

1692
02:05:12,171 --> 02:05:17,370
Mukundan, who thinks of Chemmannoor in every
breath the same Chemmannoor cheated you.

1693
02:05:18,777 --> 02:05:23,146
The loss of money, blaming Society
Gopalan was all a scam.

1694
02:05:23,682 --> 02:05:26,480
Keeping the bank manager
I front comrade Karunan.

1695
02:05:26,852 --> 02:05:29,650
No, a game played by the
Minister Karunan played.

1696
02:05:34,527 --> 02:05:36,324
Karuna had a clear agenda

1697
02:05:36,529 --> 02:05:38,497
He implemented and succeed in it.

1698
02:05:39,198 --> 02:05:44,158
You struggled so long for something
you had no connection with.

1699
02:06:34,153 --> 02:06:35,950
Hello, Anwar.

1700
02:06:48,334 --> 02:06:50,461
It is that Chinese girl who
cheated Mukundan.

1701
02:07:15,694 --> 02:07:23,658
That day that girl came to the Cafeteria
to ask for some money from you.

1702
02:07:23,969 --> 02:07:29,669
Siddharthan, that day had said he had to go
to Jabel Ali after giving your money to you.

1703
02:07:31,310 --> 02:07:33,505
After giving the money to that Chinese...

1704
02:07:34,046 --> 02:07:39,006
ordered food and sat there
instead of going to Jabel Ali.

1705
02:07:39,485 --> 02:07:41,112
At that time itself I should
have doubted him.

1706
02:07:48,293 --> 02:07:49,783
Shu Min. Shu Min.

1707
02:07:53,399 --> 02:07:55,867
Since Mukundan went out
on some urgent work...

1708
02:07:56,168 --> 02:07:58,033
he told her he would give
the money himself...

1709
02:07:58,404 --> 02:08:03,706
that he would give her ticket at the
airport and make her believe him.

1710
02:08:04,243 --> 02:08:07,644
When Shu Min said she will see
Mukundan and bid farewell,

1711
02:08:07,846 --> 02:08:11,213
Siddharthan said it was time for her flight,
and sent her to the airport.

1712
02:08:22,094 --> 02:08:22,719
Taxi.

1713
02:08:27,599 --> 02:08:28,327
Get in.

1714
02:08:45,718 --> 02:08:49,017
First Uncle, then brother in law.

1715
02:08:51,490 --> 02:08:52,684
Never mind.

1716
02:08:54,293 --> 02:09:00,596
I read somewhere that unless
we allow others cannot betray us.

1717
02:09:02,401 --> 02:09:06,462
It is my mistake.
Now no use of blaming any one.

1718
02:09:09,908 --> 02:09:11,273
Where is that girl now?

1719
02:09:11,677 --> 02:09:14,942
We did not how you would react
when come to know the truth,

1720
02:09:15,180 --> 02:09:16,306
we did not bring her inside.

1721
02:09:16,648 --> 02:09:17,672
Maya get her.

1722
02:09:38,704 --> 02:09:42,538
Forgive me, really I don't know.

1723
02:10:11,670 --> 02:10:14,537
As Mukundan thought she
is not a communist.

1724
02:10:16,475 --> 02:10:22,436
Her boyfriend was hounded by Govt.
For protesting against communism.

1725
02:10:26,985 --> 02:10:31,615
She came here to send money
for his treatment.

1726
02:10:32,658 --> 02:10:35,627
Now when she hears communists
she hates them.

1727
02:10:39,998 --> 02:10:45,129
Said that comrade, EMS, Krishna Pillai etc
were household names and now...

1728
02:10:50,075 --> 02:10:54,239
When you did not know her language, Siddharthan
must have told you all these lies. Isn't it?

1729
02:10:55,013 --> 02:10:56,708
They are all in Karim's hotel.

1730
02:10:57,182 --> 02:11:00,151
To study the problems of the Indian
expats here the minister's tour.

1731
02:11:00,352 --> 02:11:07,155
No. It is a function to award some
expats with gold laden shawl,

1732
02:11:07,359 --> 02:11:10,157
with no gold in it.
He has come for that.

1733
02:11:10,362 --> 02:11:13,820
Yes. I am the Anchor for one such
function tomorrow are Dera.

1734
02:11:14,066 --> 02:11:15,761
What time tomorrow?

1735
02:11:16,101 --> 02:11:21,334
Thus with work and religion
he came on top of the...

1736
02:11:21,640 --> 02:11:24,837
...expatriate Indian community here.

1737
02:11:25,043 --> 02:11:27,409
I am very happy to be a chief guest
in the felicitation...

1738
02:11:28,046 --> 02:11:34,508
of our Kunjunni who works hard for
the betterment of this and our nation.

1739
02:11:41,059 --> 02:11:45,018
Anwar told me everything, but I did not
understand hiding away from us.

1740
02:11:45,564 --> 02:11:47,862
Mukundan we were all here...

1741
02:11:49,902 --> 02:11:51,870
Let it go, no use of talking any more.

1742
02:11:52,571 --> 02:11:54,539
Minister Karunan is talking
on the stage.

1743
02:11:55,207 --> 02:11:56,697
Sweeper Kunjunni is being
given a golden shawl.

1744
02:11:57,142 --> 02:12:00,441
Next to Mr. Kunjunni, who is the
pride of Malayalees...

1745
02:12:00,646 --> 02:12:02,876
is a function to award him
with Pravasee Ratna.

1746
02:12:03,081 --> 02:12:07,541
For that I request Minister Karunan
on the stage.

1747
02:12:08,253 --> 02:12:11,450
I also request Mr. Kunjunni too
to receive the award.

1748
02:12:41,687 --> 02:12:46,818
Dear expat friends,
this land encouraged me...

1749
02:12:47,025 --> 02:12:52,486
...as a businessman and
as a man in society.

1750
02:12:52,965 --> 02:12:58,995
This your encouragement gladdens me.
Thanks a thousand thanks.

1751
02:12:59,871 --> 02:13:02,396
When I see the faces of Malayalees...
I think of a poetry.

1752
02:13:02,607 --> 02:13:05,508
When one smells the love
of the Malayalee people...

1753
02:13:05,711 --> 02:13:11,513
I forget the kick of the camels,
and the troubles here.

1754
02:13:12,150 --> 02:13:14,675
Then to remind of a special thing...

1755
02:13:14,886 --> 02:13:21,792
I have kept my latest music album for
sale at the counter outside the auditorium.

1756
02:13:22,327 --> 02:13:25,125
I humbly beg all the music lovers
to purchase...

1757
02:13:25,297 --> 02:13:32,465
...buy one copy of the same
and bless this humble man.

1758
02:13:32,904 --> 02:13:40,208
The name of my new album
is Loving eyes. Thanks

1759
02:13:59,398 --> 02:14:00,262
Mukundan

1760
02:14:03,769 --> 02:14:06,067
the minister who came for the expat...

1761
02:14:06,271 --> 02:14:07,898
...award function in Karim's hotel
have all booked...

1762
02:14:08,106 --> 02:14:09,403
...for a desert camp for tonight.

1763
02:14:09,608 --> 02:14:15,171
A camp meant for 500 people is booked for only
25 people by Minister Karunan and Kunjunni.

1764
02:14:15,380 --> 02:14:18,838
Means giving away the money of the
balance 475 people for nothing.

1765
02:14:19,284 --> 02:14:21,411
They won't do so unless they are
trapping a big rat.

1766
02:14:21,620 --> 02:14:26,421
When we watched the hotel we got
a list of foreigners in the Hotel.

1767
02:14:26,892 --> 02:14:29,087
Looks like our party has got
good influence in the gulf.

1768
02:14:30,695 --> 02:14:33,095
Anyway we are trying some things.

1769
02:14:33,965 --> 02:14:35,091
Mukundan, come with us, I will tell you.

1770
02:14:35,967 --> 02:14:36,763
Good evening.

1771
02:14:39,004 --> 02:14:41,268
Call later. Please have it sir.

1772
02:14:41,807 --> 02:14:44,275
Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

1773
02:14:55,153 --> 02:14:57,280
We have to please many...

1774
02:14:57,589 --> 02:15:00,114
...convince the party people,
close the opposition's mouth.

1775
02:15:00,392 --> 02:15:02,622
Then dealing in such materials...

1776
02:15:02,828 --> 02:15:03,954
...we have to fear the common public too.

1777
02:15:04,496 --> 02:15:07,363
To tell you the truth,
I am taking a risk.

1778
02:15:07,666 --> 02:15:10,965
Then did you get in this deal to catch
a fish without wetting the hand?

1779
02:15:11,169 --> 02:15:17,233
What I am saying is will these whites
will do as they say?

1780
02:15:17,442 --> 02:15:21,469
Leave all that to me.
I have talked in detail to them.

1781
02:15:21,913 --> 02:15:24,711
You be without fear.
Aren't we in the opposition?

1782
02:15:24,916 --> 02:15:28,909
We will make some noise in the assembly.
- But we will do what is needed.

1783
02:15:32,958 --> 02:15:35,984
Be careful. You know where
to keep it right? Go.

1784
02:15:37,529 --> 02:15:38,587
Any problem?

1785
02:15:38,797 --> 02:15:42,597
There is no problem, on the whole
he is taking a big risk.

1786
02:15:42,801 --> 02:15:45,326
So the understanding between
us is very important.

1787
02:15:45,537 --> 02:15:47,334
Everything should be prompt
and perfect.

1788
02:15:47,539 --> 02:15:50,007
We discussed it and decided
everything is alright.

1789
02:15:50,208 --> 02:15:52,676
Yes. Yes I know.
But this problem...

1790
02:15:53,211 --> 02:15:53,939
I have told you...

1791
02:16:01,419 --> 02:16:03,444
No use of repeating again and
again the same thing.

1792
02:16:03,655 --> 02:16:06,180
Take money from the white man,
and shake his hands.

1793
02:16:06,458 --> 02:16:10,360
You can inform him the date of signing
the deal after going to Kerala.

1794
02:16:10,562 --> 02:16:12,359
Give it madam.
- Okay.

1795
02:16:13,732 --> 02:16:14,756
Here you go.
- Thank you

1796
02:16:19,137 --> 02:16:19,967
Thank you madam.

1797
02:18:50,188 --> 02:18:56,149
Siddhartha, get up. Is there no one
to give tea or anything?

1798
02:18:57,028 --> 02:18:58,495
No one is to be seen.

1799
02:18:58,797 --> 02:18:59,764
No one?

1800
02:19:01,066 --> 02:19:03,762
Brother Karim.
Where has he gone?

1801
02:19:05,737 --> 02:19:10,106
Karim. Even the cars we came
in can't be seen.

1802
02:19:10,308 --> 02:19:12,936
What? What?
Can't see any of the drivers too.

1803
02:19:13,578 --> 02:19:16,069
Can't see the cars too.
- What happened?

1804
02:19:17,315 --> 02:19:19,112
Can't get my mobile phone too.

1805
02:19:19,651 --> 02:19:22,119
Siddhartha, call the tour operator
and give him some bad words.

1806
02:19:22,320 --> 02:19:24,049
Playing with us in a foreign land?

1807
02:19:24,556 --> 02:19:25,853
Hey can't find my mobile.

1808
02:19:26,758 --> 02:19:27,782
I can't find my mobile too.

1809
02:19:29,094 --> 02:19:30,618
If no one's mobile can be found?

1810
02:19:30,895 --> 02:19:32,522
Looks like some one is
doing it purposely.

1811
02:19:33,665 --> 02:19:35,132
Then what shall we do?

1812
02:19:35,333 --> 02:19:37,733
Didn't you both organized all this?
Then you are asking me?

1813
02:19:39,003 --> 02:19:59,687
Karim. Karim...

1814
02:20:22,313 --> 02:20:23,780
A vehicle is coming.

1815
02:20:27,552 --> 02:20:30,248
Let them come here.
Then we will do something.

1816
02:21:08,493 --> 02:21:11,394
Since you did not have any mobile
you could not contact anyone isn't it?

1817
02:21:11,596 --> 02:21:12,494
Mukundan, you...

1818
02:21:13,765 --> 02:21:15,733
You did not forget my name isn't it?
I am glad.

1819
02:21:15,934 --> 02:21:17,401
There was no news about you.

1820
02:21:17,602 --> 02:21:19,069
When I asked around some
said you went to Iraq...

1821
02:21:19,270 --> 02:21:23,900
Hey no. Where shall I go from the place
which comrade Karunan found for me.

1822
02:21:27,278 --> 02:21:29,405
Come, let us go in that tent and talk.

1823
02:21:29,681 --> 02:21:30,909
It is a long time since I saw you.

1824
02:21:31,282 --> 02:21:35,241
No, Karunan. This sun and
sand I am use to.

1825
02:21:36,721 --> 02:21:40,987
In the heat which the poor
party people developed...

1826
02:21:41,292 --> 02:21:43,260
...the Karunan who enjoyed everything...

1827
02:21:43,528 --> 02:21:45,996
...I know will find it difficult
to withstand this heat.

1828
02:21:46,798 --> 02:21:48,527
Why does Mukundan, talk like this?

1829
02:22:02,247 --> 02:22:03,771
Do you remember these
people from Chemmannoor?

1830
02:22:04,215 --> 02:22:06,274
This is Karim.
He helped us a little.

1831
02:22:06,584 --> 02:22:08,108
No need to talk more, Mukundan...

1832
02:22:08,319 --> 02:22:09,946
...we should beat him and kill him.
- No. Wait.

1833
02:22:11,155 --> 02:22:17,458
The poor man who went around for
party his whole life, my father

1834
02:22:17,829 --> 02:22:19,797
...how did you feel like...
cheating him, Karunan?

1835
02:22:21,332 --> 02:22:24,790
With the friends you got now,
you are betraying...

1836
02:22:25,003 --> 02:22:28,461
...your party in Kerala and
the people who elected you.

1837
02:22:28,673 --> 02:22:29,970
I can't make that ok.

1838
02:22:30,575 --> 02:22:33,635
I can forget what you did
to my father and me.

1839
02:22:34,112 --> 02:22:36,808
Now I have got used to getting cheated.

1840
02:22:37,348 --> 02:22:39,248
All the money I made with my sweat,

1841
02:22:39,517 --> 02:22:40,484
your brother in law...
...cheated and took it away.

1842
02:22:40,685 --> 02:22:42,915
I did not. What are you saying?
- Don't talk.

1843
02:22:56,701 --> 02:22:57,827
I could pardoned that too.

1844
02:22:58,303 --> 02:23:01,067
But for making an innocent
girl an accused...

1845
02:23:01,272 --> 02:23:03,001
...you have get punished by
the laws of this land.

1846
02:23:03,207 --> 02:23:05,334
The police are waiting for you outside.

1847
02:23:06,711 --> 02:23:07,939
What is your aim?

1848
02:23:08,379 --> 02:23:10,847
Do you think you have grown
so big to threaten us?

1849
02:23:11,382 --> 02:23:14,180
Karunan, is the most powerful
minister in Kerala.

1850
02:23:14,485 --> 02:23:16,510
We too are not less. Understand?

1851
02:23:16,721 --> 02:23:20,680
I know Mr. Kunjunni boss.
You are all smart too.

1852
02:23:20,892 --> 02:23:24,350
A party made fight the
bourgeois exploitation...

1853
02:23:24,562 --> 02:23:27,030
...you are able to change
it a little now.

1854
02:23:27,231 --> 02:23:29,859
You think for the pains and
troubles you experienced before,

1855
02:23:30,201 --> 02:23:32,965
you want to enjoy some
good time now...

1856
02:23:33,171 --> 02:23:36,299
...and people like Karunan
are able to do so too.

1857
02:23:37,809 --> 02:23:41,370
But this life in which of betrayal and
plotting cheating, is this all a life?

1858
02:23:41,579 --> 02:23:42,739
Stop it.

1859
02:23:42,947 --> 02:23:45,438
You villain don't talk.
If you do I will cut your tongue.

1860
02:23:46,017 --> 02:23:51,546
Karuna, our party is the sweat,
blood and tears of people.

1861
02:23:51,756 --> 02:23:54,054
Sitting on the chest of those people...

1862
02:23:54,258 --> 02:23:56,886
...today you confirmed the deal
with that foreigner today

1863
02:23:59,364 --> 02:24:02,458
From today afternoon it will be field
day for the TV channels in Kerala.

1864
02:24:02,667 --> 02:24:03,565
The face of the White man...

1865
02:24:03,768 --> 02:24:04,894
...Karunan's and Kunjunni's face
with a bag full...

1866
02:24:05,103 --> 02:24:06,730
...of dollars has come well in
the camera we kept there.

1867
02:24:06,938 --> 02:24:08,906
If by afternoon today you are able
to reach the hotel today

1868
02:24:09,173 --> 02:24:11,141
...then you can see on
the TV everything.

1869
02:24:12,944 --> 02:24:17,847
And when you go back they will
welcome you with...

1870
02:24:18,049 --> 02:24:21,416
...a garland of slippers
and rotten eggs.

1871
02:24:22,820 --> 02:24:25,914
You are living on strength
of the party people.

1872
02:24:26,124 --> 02:24:29,924
If that is not there you are just
Thottathil Parambil Karunan.

1873
02:24:31,295 --> 02:24:32,592
So now we are going.

1874
02:24:32,797 --> 02:24:34,924
If you walk about 50 kilometers
on this sand...

1875
02:24:35,133 --> 02:24:36,691
...you won't fail to reach the main road.

1876
02:24:37,301 --> 02:24:38,427
We are taking Siddharthan.

1877
02:24:38,803 --> 02:24:40,100
To hand over to the police.
Come on.

1878
02:24:40,304 --> 02:24:40,827
Uncle.

1879
02:24:40,972 --> 02:24:44,840
Leave him. Let's escape from here
- You and your...

1880
02:24:45,943 --> 02:24:46,967
Oh, God.

1881
02:24:51,149 --> 02:24:53,777
Ok the let us see, comrade.
Red Salute.

1882
02:25:08,666 --> 02:25:12,261
Hey, I am feeling tired, thirsty & giddy.
- Get up and come.

1883
02:25:13,938 --> 02:25:15,303
Where are you going.
- What we will do?

1884
02:25:15,506 --> 02:25:21,638
Now we have walk. That Mukundan
should be killed, you wastrel.

1885
02:25:34,926 --> 02:25:38,657
A little money.
My earning of last three years.

1886
02:25:40,264 --> 02:25:43,324
If he gets good treatment if your
friend will become better...

1887
02:25:44,936 --> 02:25:45,994
...for that you must accept this.

1888
02:25:47,038 --> 02:25:49,563
You came here for that purpose, isn't it?

1889
02:25:50,608 --> 02:25:54,510
May be he wants your company
and love more than the treatment.

1890
02:25:55,713 --> 02:25:58,841
Let both of you have a good life.

1891
02:26:04,489 --> 02:26:09,927
I don't want, though not intentionally
yet I was a cause of all your troubles.

1892
02:26:11,229 --> 02:26:14,858
The love you had for me
which I did not realize...

1893
02:26:15,333 --> 02:26:17,130
...that too I am not able
to give it back.

1894
02:26:17,502 --> 02:26:21,700
And now this is all you have
and how can I accept that?

1895
02:26:21,906 --> 02:26:25,364
From Childhood China
was my dream land.

1896
02:26:27,578 --> 02:26:33,210
I don't know whether I loved you
or the china in you.

1897
02:26:34,185 --> 02:26:38,053
This was the money which I saved for
paying back a loan which was not there.

1898
02:26:38,422 --> 02:26:39,946
Now it is of no use to me.

1899
02:26:41,425 --> 02:26:46,954
Communist principle is that not to have
more money than you need for life.

1900
02:26:47,265 --> 02:26:50,063
The rest for the people who struggle.

1901
02:26:50,835 --> 02:26:53,736
Now you need this money.
You must take it.

1902
02:27:07,852 --> 02:27:15,759
May be I won't see you again,
but I will never forget you, is what she said.

1903
02:27:41,986 --> 02:27:45,183
On what basis you decided that
you don't need that money?

1904
02:27:45,990 --> 02:27:49,949
If you become sick?
For the life when you come home?

1905
02:27:50,161 --> 02:27:51,128
You don't need money for anything?

1906
02:27:53,731 --> 02:27:57,531
A practical communist is a man
who lives for others.

1907
02:27:58,402 --> 02:28:00,632
I don't have any worries
about myself.

1908
02:28:01,072 --> 02:28:02,801
The life here taught me if one
has a heart to work...

1909
02:28:03,074 --> 02:28:07,238
...there is a solution to
everything in this world.

1910
02:28:08,212 --> 02:28:09,975
Then about coming back to Kerala...

1911
02:28:10,581 --> 02:28:12,378
...a society not knowing
the price of labor...

1912
02:28:12,683 --> 02:28:14,241
...if they get a small percentage...

1913
02:28:14,485 --> 02:28:22,085
...will close the eyes on any injustice done
talking only about opportunity and forgetting...

1914
02:28:22,460 --> 02:28:24,325
...duty does not need me.
- They need you.

1915
02:28:24,862 --> 02:28:28,389
A leader knowing the value of labor
knowing the duties and opportunities...

1916
02:28:29,033 --> 02:28:32,992
...leading by example is needed
by the people today.

1917
02:28:34,872 --> 02:28:37,670
Anwar, I won't become
a leader of any one.

1918
02:28:38,409 --> 02:28:44,439
I am experiencing a great equality among
the cattle and the plants here.

1919
02:28:45,049 --> 02:28:47,176
In that way I am quiet satisfied.

1920
02:28:47,718 --> 02:28:49,845
No, Mukundan cannot
escape like that.

1921
02:28:50,888 --> 02:28:55,188
You have the responsibility to get the wronged
people back again on the track.

1922
02:28:55,459 --> 02:29:00,692
Haven't you told me many times that
a communist man's life is endless.

1923
02:29:01,799 --> 02:29:04,199
Can Mukundan escape from it?

1924
02:29:30,428 --> 02:29:45,571
Congrats. Congrats. Congrats.
Congrats. Many, many Congrats.

1925
02:29:49,113 --> 02:29:52,412
These hands won't tire now.
These legs won't get weak now.

1926
02:29:52,783 --> 02:30:03,591
It is time to be lead by people like Cuba Mukundan
By example and experience.

1927
02:30:03,794 --> 02:30:07,924
"You are the flowering tree from
the soil where... Blood was spilt."

1928
02:30:08,132 --> 02:30:12,592
"A nation in which many
such flowers bloomed."

1929
02:30:12,803 --> 02:30:17,172
"See my comrades, on the
street that we came in..."

1930
02:30:17,375 --> 02:30:24,713
"...See the words written in the blood of many."
"Revolution, red salutes."
