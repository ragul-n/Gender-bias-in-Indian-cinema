Good morning, baby...

2
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:39,366
Are you awake?

3
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:41,500
Baby?

4
00:04:45,432 --> 00:04:48,868
You've been sleeping

00:04:49,332 --> 00:04:51,167
Baby, l'm coming in now...

00:04:53,866 --> 00:04:57,135
Your mom will lecture me,
like always...

7
00:05:18,065 --> 00:05:20,300
Sir...!

8
00:05:20,899 --> 00:05:22,166
Sir...!!!

9
00:06:01,933 --> 00:06:03,734
Hey forensic team...

10
00:06:04,332 --> 00:06:05,966
Found something?

11
00:06:06,132 --> 00:06:07,366
Make it quick.

12
00:06:13,065 --> 00:06:14,332
Sachin...

13
00:06:16,165 --> 00:06:19,167
What's going on?

14
00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:23,733
Tell me, what's happened?

15
00:06:23,799 --> 00:06:24,866
Ayesha...

16
00:06:25,866 --> 00:06:27,701
What's happened?
- Ayesha...

17
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:31,299
Hold on, ma'am...
- Get aside!

18
00:06:31,366 --> 00:06:32,366
You can't go in...

19
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,900
Hold on, ma'am.

20
00:06:35,966 --> 00:06:37,067
We are in the middle
of a crime scene...

21
00:06:37,132 --> 00:06:38,700
Get her out...
- Come...

22
00:06:38,766 --> 00:06:39,933

Come on, get up.
- Take her out.

25
00:06:44,065 --> 00:06:45,166
Go.

26
00:06:50,632 --> 00:06:51,833
Aarti...

27
00:06:52,933 --> 00:06:57,070
We got to be strong...

28
00:07:17,799 --> 00:07:19,133

- Yes, sir.

29
00:07:19,632 --> 00:07:20,966
Get me a shot of the right hand...

30
00:07:21,099 --> 00:07:22,800
...zoom in on it.

31
00:07:23,065 --> 00:07:24,733
Can you see the hair-strand?
- Yes, sir.

32
00:07:24,899 --> 00:07:25,733
Dabbang!

33
00:07:25,799 --> 00:07:27,233
Yes, sir...
- Come.

34
00:07:28,065 --> 00:07:29,232
Bring me the forceps.

35
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:51,967
Who saw the body first?

36
00:07:55,232 --> 00:07:57,200
Will someone answer me!?

37
00:07:58,265 --> 00:07:59,299
l...

38
00:08:00,866 --> 00:08:01,933
Your name?

39
00:08:02,799 --> 00:08:04,700
Remi Fernandes.

40
00:08:05,466 --> 00:08:06,800
Your relation to the victim?

41
00:08:07,933 --> 00:08:08,900
Remi's been...

42
00:08:08,966 --> 00:08:11,535
...with our family for thirty years...

43
00:08:11,733 --> 00:08:12,733
She is family.

44
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:16,135
You'll get your turn...

45
00:08:16,866 --> 00:08:18,100

46
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:19,599

...l was Ayesha's nanny too...

50
00:08:41,866 --> 00:08:44,535
What time did you see the body?

51
00:08:47,099 --> 00:08:48,967
...what time?

52
00:08:50,866 --> 00:08:52,000
Six-thirty.

53
00:08:53,065 --> 00:08:54,766
Who else was at home at that time?

54
00:08:55,466 --> 00:08:56,667
Me...

55
00:08:56,899 --> 00:08:58,033
Mr. Sachin...

56
00:08:58,666 --> 00:09:02,903
...and Ayesha...

57
00:09:03,132 --> 00:09:03,799
...Chetan...

58
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:05,568
No, Chetan wasn't there...

59
00:09:06,065 --> 00:09:07,566
Who's Chetan?

60
00:09:08,599 --> 00:09:09,933
He works here too.

61
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Chetan's done this...

62
00:09:11,065 --> 00:09:13,700
...please,
for God's sake, look for him...

63
00:09:13,766 --> 00:09:17,069
Shut up!
...don't interrupt...

64
00:09:17,132 --> 00:09:19,667
...let us do our work!

65
00:09:20,933 --> 00:09:22,668
Sit down quietly.

66
00:09:23,032 --> 00:09:24,733
Sit down...

67
00:09:30,466 --> 00:09:31,567
Yes, ma'am.

68
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:34,969
How long has Chetan
been working here?

69
00:09:35,566 --> 00:09:37,401
l don't know...

70
00:09:37,933 --> 00:09:39,668
...maybe...

71
00:09:39,799 --> 00:09:42,101
Two-three months...

72
00:09:42,566 --> 00:09:43,667
Where is he now?

73
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,801
l haven't seen him since morning...

74
00:09:46,899 --> 00:09:50,035
So, Chetan has not been seen in
the house since the body was found?

75
00:09:50,733 --> 00:09:51,834
No...

76
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,601
When did you see him last?

77
00:09:53,966 --> 00:09:55,600
Last night.

78
00:09:56,899 --> 00:09:57,699
Night.

79
00:09:57,766 --> 00:09:58,800
What time?

80
00:09:58,866 --> 00:10:02,402
At about eleven...

81
00:10:02,632 --> 00:10:03,699
Where are the servant quarters?

82
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,970
The cupboard's empty...

83
00:10:38,499 --> 00:10:39,099
...he's gone.

84
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:42,666
Did you find something?

85
00:10:42,733 --> 00:10:43,667
No, sir.

86
00:10:44,566 --> 00:10:46,834
Did Chetan have any
belongings in his room?

87
00:10:47,499 --> 00:10:48,566
Lots, sir...

88
00:10:50,065 --> 00:10:51,966
...his clothes...

89
00:10:52,432 --> 00:10:54,700
...a mirror, his comb, toothbrush...

90
00:10:54,966 --> 00:10:56,067
...photographs of his God...

91
00:10:56,132 --> 00:10:57,733
...holy books, etc...

92
00:10:57,799 --> 00:11:00,401
Eveything's gone now...

93
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:03,901
Listen, do you have
Chetan's documents?

94
00:11:04,532 --> 00:11:06,767
Chetan Chunilal Tiwari...

95
00:11:08,733 --> 00:11:11,469
Who referred him to you?

96
00:11:12,499 --> 00:11:13,633
Sudhakar Mishra...

97
00:11:13,866 --> 00:11:15,000
Who's he?

98
00:11:16,032 --> 00:11:19,535
He supplies food to our clinic...

99
00:11:20,332 --> 00:11:21,433
...he'd got Chetan to me...

100
00:11:22,632 --> 00:11:24,033
...he'd said Chetan
was his brother-in-law...

101
00:11:24,099 --> 00:11:26,000
Hmm, brother-in-law...

102
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:28,333
Dabbang, pass me that pen...

103
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:34,034
Whose pen is this?

104
00:11:36,032 --> 00:11:37,366
...anSWer me...

105
00:11:37,766 --> 00:11:38,967
...whose pen is it?

106
00:11:43,866 --> 00:11:45,400
Ayesha...?

107
00:11:46,632 --> 00:11:47,599
What?

108
00:11:50,499 --> 00:11:51,066
My daughter's...

109
00:11:51,332 --> 00:11:55,069
Do you take me for a fool?

110
00:11:55,899 --> 00:11:58,067
Students don't use
such expensive pens.

111
00:11:58,332 --> 00:12:02,002
Find Chetan, he'll slip away
while you waste your time here...

112
00:12:02,265 --> 00:12:03,299
Shut up!

113
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:10,701
Don't scream at a policeman.

114
00:12:11,766 --> 00:12:14,301
All of you will come
to the police station, now.

115
00:12:17,933 --> 00:12:20,402

116
00:12:22,299 --> 00:12:23,566

You can go, ma'am.
Please go...

121
00:12:41,332 --> 00:12:42,499
Yes doctor...tell me...

122
00:12:43,699 --> 00:12:44,900

00:12:45,699 --> 00:12:47,367
l was at the hotel Meridian...

124
00:12:48,766 --> 00:12:50,367
...in Madh Island...

125
00:12:53,499 --> 00:12:55,367
...till eleven.

00:13:04,265 --> 00:13:08,936
...and l went off to sleep.

128
00:13:14,632 --> 00:13:18,602
When Remi woke me
up this morning...l...

129
00:13:23,733 --> 00:13:24,934
Doctor...

130
00:13:26,632 --> 00:13:33,405
...you never mentioned
all this earlier...

131
00:13:33,799 --> 00:13:37,369
...the innocent victim,
that you are...

132
00:13:37,699 --> 00:13:39,200
Dabbang! Come here...

133
00:13:39,265 --> 00:13:40,633
Please...find the killer...please...

134
00:13:40,699 --> 00:13:44,436
Take him for the medical
examination...

135
00:13:47,466 --> 00:13:48,667
Patil...

136
00:13:48,866 --> 00:13:51,602
A doctor's being doctored!

137
00:13:53,699 --> 00:13:54,666
Speak up!

138
00:13:57,632 --> 00:13:59,467
l don't have all day...

139
00:13:59,532 --> 00:14:03,702
Sir...l was on duty,
at the main gate...

140
00:14:05,432 --> 00:14:06,466
Alright...

141
00:14:07,699 --> 00:14:16,507
Did you see anyone entering
the apartment after ten last night?

142
00:14:18,332 --> 00:14:19,566
Sir...

143
00:14:19,632 --> 00:14:23,202
...that boy from the
bungalow across the road...

144
00:14:23,232 --> 00:14:24,266
What's his name?

145
00:14:24,332 --> 00:14:25,833
Riyaz Noorani...

146
00:14:25,899 --> 00:14:27,667
'Riyaz Noorani'...right?

147
00:14:27,733 --> 00:14:29,534
Yes...
- So, what about him?

148
00:14:30,165 --> 00:14:31,332
Sir...

149
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:32,900
Riyaz had come to the apartment...

150
00:14:34,165 --> 00:14:37,468
...at around eleven...

151
00:14:37,532 --> 00:14:38,366
And then...?

152
00:14:38,432 --> 00:14:41,768
An hour later...

153
00:14:42,199 --> 00:14:44,234
Dr. Sachin Mahajan
reached his apartment...

154
00:14:44,299 --> 00:14:45,667
Tell me the exact time.

155
00:14:47,733 --> 00:14:49,534
Twelve...
...midnight...

156
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,700
Hmm, midnight?

157
00:14:50,766 --> 00:14:52,200
Ok, continue...

158
00:14:52,632 --> 00:15:00,673
After ten or fifteen
minutes of Sachin's arrival,

159
00:15:01,299 --> 00:15:03,801
...Riyaz left the
building in a huff...

160
00:15:04,065 --> 00:15:07,067
Did you hear any noise
from inside the apartment?

161
00:15:07,132 --> 00:15:08,533
Like a fight...or someone screaming?

162
00:15:10,232 --> 00:15:11,333
No, sir...

163
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:14,168
Tell me the truth or...

164
00:15:14,232 --> 00:15:15,566
Sir...

165
00:15:15,799 --> 00:15:20,236
...when Riyaz left the building...

166
00:15:20,299 --> 00:15:23,235
...his arm was bleeding and
there was a bandage around it.

167
00:15:23,499 --> 00:15:25,200
He was in a fit of anger...

168
00:15:26,199 --> 00:15:27,733
You can leave now. Go!

169
00:15:29,632 --> 00:15:31,734
He left home at eleven last night...

170
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:34,234
...to meet a friend...

171
00:15:34,299 --> 00:15:36,334
...he hasn't returned since then...

172
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,134
There's nothing to wory about...

173
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:39,800
...this isn't the first time...

174
00:15:40,199 --> 00:15:43,268
...he stays out for days together...

175
00:15:43,332 --> 00:15:44,800
...with his cellphone off.

176
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:46,668
Young people...can't stop them...

177
00:15:50,265 --> 00:15:55,470
What was his relation
with Ayesha Mahajan?

178
00:15:59,499 --> 00:16:00,766
Who's Ayesha?

179
00:16:02,265 --> 00:16:06,669
Dr. Sachin and Dr. Aarti Mahajan's
daughter, from across the street.

180
00:16:09,299 --> 00:16:12,235
Riyaz has many girlfriends.

181
00:16:12,566 --> 00:16:15,368
We can't keep track of all of them...

182
00:16:15,699 --> 00:16:17,167
Well...

183
00:16:18,566 --> 00:16:21,635
...this girl has been murdered.

184
00:16:22,299 --> 00:16:25,635
And your son Riyaz was in her
bedroom at the time of the murder.

185
00:16:27,332 --> 00:16:30,768
Not so funny now, hmm?

186
00:16:31,733 --> 00:16:33,167
Dabbang...let's go.

187
00:17:11,499 --> 00:17:13,334
Scratch marks on his chest...

188
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:15,467
...and a lump on
the back of his head...

189
00:17:15,532 --> 00:17:18,001
We've sent his blood for the tests...

190
00:17:18,299 --> 00:17:20,300
Did you get any lead on Chetan?

191
00:17:20,366 --> 00:17:22,935
The police is not answerable to you.

192
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:40,600
Where?

193
00:17:52,165 --> 00:17:53,366
Hey underpants...

194
00:17:53,399 --> 00:17:55,334
Who's Sudhakar Mishra?

195
00:17:57,065 --> 00:17:58,933
Yes sir, it's me...

196
00:17:58,966 --> 00:18:00,500

00:18:01,032 --> 00:18:03,200
Yes, sir...
And, you sir?

198
00:18:03,432 --> 00:18:05,333
Can't you see who we are?

199
00:18:05,399 --> 00:18:06,967
What's your relation
to Chetan Tiwari?

200
00:18:07,232 --> 00:18:09,100
...he's my brother-in-law...

201
00:18:09,165 --> 00:18:11,534
Where is he now?

202
00:18:11,933 --> 00:18:12,933
What's the matter, sir?

203
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,302
You'll find out.

204
00:18:15,366 --> 00:18:16,200
Dabbang...he's yours...

205
00:18:16,265 --> 00:18:19,201

208
00:18:23,265 --> 00:18:27,602
Where's Chetan Tiwari?

209
00:18:28,299 --> 00:18:29,867
Don't ty my patience...

210
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,635
...l'll hit you where it hurts most...
You'll never stand erect then.

211
00:18:32,899 --> 00:18:33,866
Tell me now, where's Chetan!?

212
00:18:33,933 --> 00:18:36,502
l haven't heard from him
for the last two days.

213
00:18:36,966 --> 00:18:39,234
So, you don't know, huh?

214
00:18:43,632 --> 00:18:45,233
l'm telling the truth...

215
00:18:48,199 --> 00:18:51,335

00:18:55,099 --> 00:18:56,600
Dabbang...
- Yes, sir.

217
00:18:56,866 --> 00:19:00,803
This Chetan Tiwari hails from Bihar...

218
00:19:01,399 --> 00:19:04,068
This guy spat out
his hometown address...

219
00:19:06,265 --> 00:19:10,369
Send this info to
the Bihar Police, now!

220
00:19:22,099 --> 00:19:24,801
Sir, this Chetan Tiwari
has a criminal record...

221
00:19:25,165 --> 00:19:27,267
These rich people ought to...

222
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:30,535
...employ domestic help
only after police verification.

223
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:31,866
But do they ever learn?

224
00:19:31,933 --> 00:19:33,534
What now, sir?
- Now...

225
00:19:34,866 --> 00:19:37,201

226
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,201

00:19:46,199 --> 00:19:49,101
...l'd place the time of
the murder at around 12:30 a.m...

229
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:53,002
There are scratches on
the victim's arms and shoulders...

230
00:19:53,899 --> 00:19:56,835
There was a struggle
before death...

231
00:19:57,199 --> 00:20:00,502
Rape?

232
00:20:00,566 --> 00:20:01,900
No.

233
00:20:02,065 --> 00:20:08,271

We are helpless against God's wish...

00:20:40,199 --> 00:20:41,233
That's true...

240
00:20:41,966 --> 00:20:43,367
Are you guys leaving this place?

241
00:20:45,232 --> 00:20:47,367
The Police has sealed our apartment.

242
00:20:47,933 --> 00:20:51,803
Stay with me till things get sorted...

243
00:20:52,065 --> 00:20:53,366

244
00:20:53,432 --> 00:20:57,235
...but we'll be staying with
Aarti's parents for a while.

245
00:20:57,866 --> 00:20:59,801

Take care Aarti...

254
00:21:13,165 --> 00:21:14,966
See you...bye.

255
00:21:26,132 --> 00:21:27,366
Come on...

256
00:21:36,499 --> 00:21:40,736
l'm sory your holiness,

257
00:21:42,366 --> 00:21:43,934
Dr. Sachin Mahajan...

258
00:21:44,299 --> 00:21:46,300
You're under arrest...

259
00:21:47,165 --> 00:21:48,165
What the hell are you talking about!?

260
00:21:48,399 --> 00:21:52,803
You're the prime suspect
for your daughter's murder.

261
00:21:52,866 --> 00:21:53,900
There's some misunderstanding...

262
00:21:53,966 --> 00:21:56,468
You can say that in court, ma'am.

263
00:21:56,733 --> 00:21:57,333
Dabbang, take him.

264
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:59,234
Just a moment!
You can't just do this...!

265
00:21:59,299 --> 00:22:01,067
Come on,
quick now, l don't have all day.

266
00:22:01,132 --> 00:22:02,399
Hold on, listen to me...

267
00:22:02,666 --> 00:22:06,736
There's some misunderstanding...
Listen inspector...please...

268
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:08,000

Please...just listen...one second,

271
00:22:12,699 --> 00:22:15,334
Let go of me! Don't touch me...!
- Hold him...come on...

272
00:22:15,399 --> 00:22:17,100
Struggling is not going to help you...
- Come on...

273
00:22:17,165 --> 00:22:19,000
Please, at least listen
to me once...please...

274
00:22:20,899 --> 00:22:22,867
Your honour...

275
00:22:22,933 --> 00:22:24,934
Dr. Sachin Mahajan's
blood report states that...

276
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,037
...he was under the influence
of alcohol that night...

277
00:22:29,699 --> 00:22:32,435
A pen, that has Dr. Mahajan's
fingerprints, was found...

278
00:22:33,132 --> 00:22:35,367
...lying on the floor
near the victim's body.

279
00:22:35,432 --> 00:22:37,267
The police discovered
from his clinic that...

280
00:22:37,332 --> 00:22:40,868
...Dr. Sachin often
carried this sort of pen...

281
00:22:41,933 --> 00:22:44,135
A blood-stained shirt
was discovered...

282
00:22:44,299 --> 00:22:50,838
...in the common garbage
dump inside the building premises.

283
00:22:50,899 --> 00:22:52,100
Objection your honour,

284
00:22:52,165 --> 00:22:53,799
The blood-stains on this shirt...

285
00:22:53,866 --> 00:22:55,200
...are not of the victim
- Ayesha Mahajan.

286
00:22:55,265 --> 00:22:57,166
Yes...you're right.

287
00:22:58,432 --> 00:22:59,633
Sir...

288
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,268
According to the forensic tests...

289
00:23:03,899 --> 00:23:07,235
...these blood-stains
belong to a 'young male'...

290
00:23:07,299 --> 00:23:09,267
...who as per the Police
is most probably...

291
00:23:09,332 --> 00:23:10,666
...Riyaz Noorani...

292
00:23:10,733 --> 00:23:13,769
...who's been absconding
since the night of the murder.

293
00:23:14,866 --> 00:23:16,634
And - as per the DNA tests...

294
00:23:17,165 --> 00:23:20,334
...the scratch marks on Dr.
Sachin Mahajan's body...

295
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:28,173
...were made by the deceased
Ayesha Mahajan and vice-versa!

296
00:23:28,833 --> 00:23:35,706
A hair-strand, proven by DNA tests
to be Dr. Sachin Mahajan's hair...

297
00:23:36,132 --> 00:23:41,237
...was found between
the victim's fingers.

298
00:23:43,833 --> 00:23:47,236
The post-mortem report states that...

299
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:50,702
Ayesha Mahajan, at the time of her
death, had been pregnant for a month.

300
00:23:57,933 --> 00:24:00,235
Sir, the case is cystal clear.

301
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:04,802
That night, a drunk Dr. Sachin
reached home at midnight...

302
00:24:05,599 --> 00:24:08,835
...only to see Riyaz
Noorani...a Muslim youth...

303
00:24:09,032 --> 00:24:11,167
...inside his daughter's bedroom.

304
00:24:11,532 --> 00:24:14,635
...he flew into a rage
and attacked Riyaz.

305
00:24:14,666 --> 00:24:16,601
Though Riyaz escaped...

306
00:24:16,866 --> 00:24:19,969
...Ayesha succumbed to
Dr. Mahajan's murderous rage.

307
00:24:20,032 --> 00:24:20,932
He's lying, your honour...!

308
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,001
Then, to destroy the evidence...

309
00:24:23,265 --> 00:24:25,700
...he tried disposing
his blood-stained shirt.

310
00:24:25,899 --> 00:24:26,733
And finally...

311
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:31,570
J
...he bribed his servant Chetan Tiwari
to leave with his belongings...

312
00:24:31,799 --> 00:24:32,633
...so that...

313
00:24:32,699 --> 00:24:35,735
...Chetan becomes the prime suspect.

314
00:24:37,299 --> 00:24:38,800
The next witness please...

315
00:24:38,866 --> 00:24:41,802
...lnspector Ram Charan Pandey
- Bihar Police.

316
00:24:41,866 --> 00:24:42,733
Sir...

317
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:45,635
...we've scanned
the whole of Bihar...

318
00:24:45,699 --> 00:24:50,737
...but there's no trace
of Chetan Tiwari anywhere.

319
00:24:50,899 --> 00:24:53,268
He was affiliated
to the mob in Bihar.

320
00:24:53,632 --> 00:25:01,606
He's hiding at the moment.

321
00:25:04,566 --> 00:25:11,172
l don't remember much
of what happened that night...

322
00:25:14,132 --> 00:25:15,867
l'd had one drink too many...

323
00:25:17,966 --> 00:25:23,071
...and when l drink excessively, l do
not remember much the next morning...

324
00:25:24,132 --> 00:25:25,466
But...Ayesha...

325
00:25:27,032 --> 00:25:28,700
...was our only child...

326
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:33,100
She was my child...

327
00:25:35,132 --> 00:25:36,566
My Ayesha...

328
00:25:39,766 --> 00:25:42,568
There's some mistake here...

329
00:25:43,165 --> 00:25:45,100
There's some mistake...

330
00:25:45,165 --> 00:25:46,799
l didn't kill her...

331
00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:53,638
She was my child...

332
00:25:59,532 --> 00:26:02,401
Please believe me...

333
00:26:03,466 --> 00:26:05,067
Dr. Sachin Mahajan...

334
00:26:05,532 --> 00:26:08,534
...is remanded to
judicial custody...

335
00:26:08,866 --> 00:26:13,170
...till the defense council
submits the defense statement.

336
00:26:29,933 --> 00:26:30,933
lnspector Malwade,

337
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,769
How did you crack this case so quickly?

338
00:26:33,833 --> 00:26:35,401
lt's our duty, ma'am.

339
00:26:35,466 --> 00:26:37,034
We did it sincerely. That's all.

340
00:26:37,099 --> 00:26:38,033
Mr. Malwade...Mr. Malwade...
one question please...

341
00:26:38,099 --> 00:26:40,100
Do you think Chetan
Tiwari will be apprehended?

342
00:26:40,165 --> 00:26:41,699
Of course, he'll be caught!

343
00:26:41,899 --> 00:26:45,068
What do you suppose we do inside the
Police station? Eat roasted peas?

344
00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:49,934
Ayesha was our eveything, Aarti...

345
00:26:53,733 --> 00:26:56,602
...we could have spent
more time with her...

346
00:26:59,032 --> 00:27:00,466
Sachin...

347
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:03,567
...what exactly happened that night?

348
00:27:03,632 --> 00:27:06,668
You know - when l drink too much...

349
00:27:06,733 --> 00:27:11,003
...l can't remember
much the next morning...

350
00:27:14,399 --> 00:27:15,833
...you know that...

351
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:22,534
Aarti, you too?

352
00:27:32,866 --> 00:27:35,001
...even you don't trust me...?

353
00:27:36,833 --> 00:27:41,671
l don't believe this!

354
00:27:44,766 --> 00:27:45,600
Smita ma'am...

355
00:27:45,666 --> 00:27:49,870
...this lady has lost her daughter...

356
00:27:50,466 --> 00:27:53,068
...and her husband has been falsely
accused of killing his own daughter...

357
00:27:53,632 --> 00:27:58,970
The Police have wrapped
up the case in haste...

358
00:27:59,733 --> 00:28:03,503
...without analyzing
the evidence thoroughly...

359
00:28:05,032 --> 00:28:08,268
This is an appeal to you ma'am,
from our NGO...

360
00:28:08,966 --> 00:28:12,035
...please help this lady get justice.

361
00:28:13,632 --> 00:28:15,367
l'll look into it.

362
00:28:48,833 --> 00:28:49,900
Paraskar...

363
00:28:50,833 --> 00:28:52,301
Sunil Paraskar...

364
00:28:53,566 --> 00:28:55,401
...from the C.B.l.
(Central Bureau of Investigation)

365
00:28:58,766 --> 00:29:00,200
Walnuts?

366
00:29:00,566 --> 00:29:01,967
They're good for the brain...

367
00:29:03,666 --> 00:29:05,367
Alright.

368
00:29:08,566 --> 00:29:12,836
The Police did such
a good job on your case...

369
00:29:13,766 --> 00:29:15,467
...that we...the C.B.l.
had to be called in.

370
00:29:16,499 --> 00:29:19,401
But for you, it's like
moving from hell to high waters.

371
00:29:24,265 --> 00:29:25,566
Not funny?

372
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:27,900
Not a problem.

373
00:29:29,232 --> 00:29:32,702
Only one person ever
Iaughs at my jokes...

374
00:29:34,666 --> 00:29:35,767
Me.

375
00:29:40,466 --> 00:29:42,734
Anyway, l studied your file...

376
00:29:43,866 --> 00:29:46,702
The post-mortem report says that...

377
00:29:47,899 --> 00:29:49,900
...the incision on Ayesha's neck...

378
00:29:50,733 --> 00:29:53,302
...was a single steady cut...

379
00:29:54,599 --> 00:29:59,303
...a neat and clean slice...

380
00:30:00,432 --> 00:30:03,368
...two inches deep...

381
00:30:04,432 --> 00:30:05,800
...through tissue...

382
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:07,699
...muscle...

383
00:30:07,766 --> 00:30:09,400
...and flesh...

384
00:30:09,466 --> 00:30:11,768
Don't do this!

385
00:30:11,833 --> 00:30:13,201
Enough...

386
00:30:13,499 --> 00:30:17,402
Leave me alone! Please...

387
00:30:23,332 --> 00:30:24,933
But then, Dr. Mahajan...

388
00:30:25,966 --> 00:30:27,801
...it struck me...

389
00:30:28,933 --> 00:30:32,236
...weren't you heavily
drunk that night?

390
00:30:33,466 --> 00:30:34,900
Were you pissed drunk or not!?

391
00:30:36,599 --> 00:30:40,536
Yes. - A drunk man couldn't have made
such a neat and precise cut.

392
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:43,966
Exactly!

393
00:30:46,933 --> 00:30:48,367
Therefore...

394
00:30:48,766 --> 00:30:51,835
...tell me what exactly
happened that night?

395
00:30:56,866 --> 00:30:58,367
l don't remember anything...

396
00:30:58,699 --> 00:31:02,903
l don't remember...
- We have ways of refreshing memories...

397
00:31:04,299 --> 00:31:05,433
Like these walnuts.

398
00:31:05,733 --> 00:31:06,834
l didn't kill my daughter.

399
00:31:06,899 --> 00:31:09,268
...she was my daughter...
why would l kill her...?

400
00:31:09,332 --> 00:31:13,335
Because Dr. Sachin Mahajan...

401
00:31:14,366 --> 00:31:21,339
...there's more to
you than meets the eye.

402
00:31:21,599 --> 00:31:22,666
What?

403
00:31:25,599 --> 00:31:27,267
What do you mean?

404
00:31:27,632 --> 00:31:29,734
What are you going to do?

405
00:31:30,432 --> 00:31:32,167
All the bloody proof
is already against me.

406
00:31:32,232 --> 00:31:34,567
l didn't kill my daughter, damn it!

407
00:31:35,699 --> 00:31:37,734
That estate agent had called...

408
00:31:38,733 --> 00:31:40,301
...you must have been avoiding him,
l'm sure...

409
00:31:40,466 --> 00:31:41,733
Do you know about Ashok Kamble...?

410
00:31:42,132 --> 00:31:43,299
What about him?

411
00:31:43,632 --> 00:31:48,903
He's purchased his own
apartment...isn't he junior to you?

412
00:31:49,165 --> 00:31:50,332
Yeah, so what?

413
00:31:50,466 --> 00:31:51,366
So...

414
00:31:51,566 --> 00:31:52,800
Where will we stay after you retire?

415
00:31:52,866 --> 00:31:57,136
This Govt. apartment
won't be ours then...

416
00:31:57,432 --> 00:31:58,299
Have you given this a thought?

417
00:31:58,366 --> 00:31:59,633
Yes, l think about it eveyday.

418
00:31:59,799 --> 00:32:02,334
That's all you do...think!

419
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:04,834
Asha, it's not easy
to buy an apartment.

420
00:32:05,232 --> 00:32:07,500
No seller bids below ten million.

421
00:32:08,065 --> 00:32:10,400
...how do you expect me to afford it?

422
00:32:11,265 --> 00:32:12,666
How the hell did
Ashok Kamble afford it?

423
00:32:12,733 --> 00:32:14,134
Don't know.

424
00:32:14,332 --> 00:32:15,366
But l'll know soon...

425
00:32:15,599 --> 00:32:17,701
...when the dept. raids his house.

426
00:32:19,466 --> 00:32:20,733
Excuse me?

427
00:32:22,232 --> 00:32:24,200
Someone's at the door for you...

428
00:32:25,132 --> 00:32:26,266
Yeah, l'm coming...

429
00:32:27,199 --> 00:32:31,336
Go, catch up with your brother...

430
00:32:35,232 --> 00:32:36,299
Yes, tell me...

431
00:32:36,466 --> 00:32:37,800
We are from the ICICl bank...

432
00:32:38,065 --> 00:32:39,099
Yeah, so?

433
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:43,169
You haven't paid the mortgage on
your car for the past three months.

434
00:32:44,132 --> 00:32:45,399
Next month...

435
00:32:47,165 --> 00:32:48,165
For sure...

436
00:33:03,366 --> 00:33:04,633
Yeah, Parvez...

437
00:33:05,132 --> 00:33:07,634
Get Dr. Mahajan's apartment
ready for a re-examination.

438
00:33:12,265 --> 00:33:13,399
Please come.

439
00:33:25,366 --> 00:33:26,500
How do you like the house, Parvez?

440
00:33:26,566 --> 00:33:28,034
lt's grand, sir...

441
00:33:57,032 --> 00:33:57,766
Where's the girl's room?

442
00:33:58,032 --> 00:33:58,699
Upstairs, sir...

443
00:33:58,966 --> 00:34:00,434
And the father's room?
- That's upstairs too.

444
00:34:00,566 --> 00:34:01,967
Let's go...

445
00:34:47,432 --> 00:34:48,566
The pen was found here, right?

446
00:34:48,632 --> 00:34:50,000
Yes, sir...

447
00:35:03,332 --> 00:35:05,067
Parvez...
- Sir...

448
00:35:06,132 --> 00:35:07,500
...it's cracked at the bottom.

449
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:10,933
Could have fallen, or...

450
00:35:23,265 --> 00:35:24,466
Look at this garment...

451
00:35:25,099 --> 00:35:26,166
Sir, it's torn...

452
00:35:26,265 --> 00:35:27,466
Torn by someone's bare hands...

453
00:35:27,866 --> 00:35:29,234
Check those drawers.

454
00:35:45,065 --> 00:35:45,965
Bring the kit...

455
00:35:46,032 --> 00:35:47,032
Sir...

456
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:52,433
Put off the lights.

457
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:02,868
There are blood-stains here,
someone has washed something here...

458
00:36:02,899 --> 00:36:05,134
Sir, should l take a swab...?
- The trace is too faint.

459
00:36:05,332 --> 00:36:06,866
You won't be able to take a swab.

460
00:36:39,399 --> 00:36:42,268
Sir...this is Dr. Sachin's bedroom...

461
00:36:42,432 --> 00:36:43,499
Yeah...

462
00:36:55,032 --> 00:36:56,533
Sir...that's Riyaz's blood...

463
00:36:56,899 --> 00:36:57,899
How do you know?

464
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,935
Sir, the District Attorney
mentioned it in court.

465
00:36:59,966 --> 00:37:01,400
But the report merely states
- 'Young male'.

466
00:37:01,799 --> 00:37:03,000
Do the Police have
Riyaz's blood sample?

467
00:37:03,265 --> 00:37:04,399
No, sir...
- So, then?

468
00:37:06,833 --> 00:37:10,436
Do you think, that after attacking
Riyaz and murdering his own daughter...

469
00:37:10,499 --> 00:37:16,738
...Dr. Mahajan would go off to sleep
in the same blood-stained shirt?

470
00:37:16,966 --> 00:37:18,100
Not possible, sir...

471
00:37:18,399 --> 00:37:20,768
But he was heavily drunk,
so anything is possible...

472
00:37:21,466 --> 00:37:22,466
lt's possible, sir...

473
00:37:24,866 --> 00:37:26,100
ls it possible or not possible?

474
00:37:26,165 --> 00:37:27,799
Don't know, sir...
- Walnuts?

475
00:37:27,866 --> 00:37:29,033
l got them, sir.
- Eat...

476
00:37:36,265 --> 00:37:37,432
Can you hear me!!?

477
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,501
Yes sir, l can hear you...

478
00:37:49,165 --> 00:37:50,432
Parvez, can you hear me!?

479
00:37:50,499 --> 00:37:53,001
Yes sir, tell me.
l can hear you clearly!

480
00:37:53,332 --> 00:37:54,232
Yes sir, tell me...

481
00:37:54,399 --> 00:37:55,299
Tell you what?

482
00:37:55,366 --> 00:37:57,000
You were saying
something from inside?

483
00:37:57,065 --> 00:37:57,832
Of course not.

484
00:37:57,899 --> 00:37:59,300
You've started imagining things now.

485
00:38:06,899 --> 00:38:08,367
Close the door.

486
00:38:49,099 --> 00:38:50,333
Are you mad at me?

487
00:38:50,766 --> 00:38:52,734
No sir, why?

488
00:38:53,165 --> 00:38:55,033
l've been teasing
you since morning...

489
00:38:55,099 --> 00:38:56,200
No sir, not at all.

490
00:38:56,833 --> 00:38:58,067
Should l continue then...?

491
00:39:00,265 --> 00:39:03,034
Send this for forensic analysis...
- Sir.

492
00:39:03,366 --> 00:39:06,635
The knife's handle has Dr. Sachin
Mahajan's fingerprints on it.

493
00:39:06,799 --> 00:39:09,034
And - the victim Ayesha
Mahajan's fingerprints too...

494
00:39:09,199 --> 00:39:11,668
That proves there was
a struggle between them.

495
00:39:12,232 --> 00:39:14,334
Does the blade have blood-stains?

496
00:39:14,766 --> 00:39:15,933
No.

497
00:39:16,933 --> 00:39:18,601
...only the handle
has fingerprints, right?

498
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,134
Yes.

499
00:39:20,265 --> 00:39:22,834
That means someone washed
the blade holding the handle?

500
00:39:23,199 --> 00:39:24,600
Possible.

501
00:39:25,099 --> 00:39:28,368
The cut on Ayesha's neck -

502
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,335
- could that cut have been
made with this surgical knife?

503
00:39:31,699 --> 00:39:32,966
Yes, it's possible.

504
00:39:35,265 --> 00:39:36,165
Alright.

505
00:39:45,866 --> 00:39:48,201
Fresh after a bath, Chhotelal?

506
00:39:49,132 --> 00:39:50,266
So...?

507
00:39:50,799 --> 00:39:51,866
Sir...l...

508
00:39:52,132 --> 00:39:54,000
...l fell asleep...

509
00:39:54,265 --> 00:39:56,333
You fall asleep
eveyday at 1 .30 a.m...

510
00:39:57,232 --> 00:39:58,866
...and you continue napping
till 5 a.m., don't you?

511
00:39:59,699 --> 00:40:00,733
Sir...

512
00:40:00,866 --> 00:40:06,137
...l work elsewhere in the day,
l get tired, so l fall asleep sir...

513
00:40:06,199 --> 00:40:07,366
What time do you assume duty?

514
00:40:08,299 --> 00:40:10,000
Sir, 10 p.m...

515
00:40:10,599 --> 00:40:12,167
What do you do between 10 p.m.
to 1 :30 a.m.?

516
00:40:12,232 --> 00:40:14,634
Sir, l am on duty, sir...

517
00:40:14,966 --> 00:40:16,200
And you don't visit the loo?

518
00:40:17,666 --> 00:40:21,336
When you got to go,
you got to go. Right?

519
00:40:22,332 --> 00:40:25,635
So, 3 minutes to go,
3 minutes to come back...

520
00:40:26,199 --> 00:40:27,633
...and how long does
it take for you...to do it...?

521
00:40:27,699 --> 00:40:29,801
Sir, 2 minutes or so...

522
00:40:29,866 --> 00:40:31,067
That's it?

523
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:34,766
...and then you smoke, right?

524
00:40:34,933 --> 00:40:39,270
No way, sir...
- Then what are these..# candles'?

525
00:40:39,666 --> 00:40:41,034
l smoke sir...
- So you smoke...

526
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:43,267
The building's staff toilet...

527
00:40:43,332 --> 00:40:46,301
...was filled with your
'candles' this evening...

528
00:40:47,232 --> 00:40:53,905
So, that night, some person may have
entered or exited the building...

529
00:40:53,966 --> 00:40:55,701
...and you may have not seen him...

530
00:40:55,966 --> 00:40:57,167
...coming or going out.

531
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:58,667
Right?

532
00:40:58,733 --> 00:40:59,633
Yes, sir...

533
00:41:00,933 --> 00:41:02,601
You'll be saying this in court.

534
00:41:25,099 --> 00:41:26,533
l'm terribly sory...

535
00:41:26,599 --> 00:41:27,733
...you had to wait...

536
00:41:27,799 --> 00:41:28,900
...l'm Dr. Hansal...

537
00:41:28,966 --> 00:41:30,067
...l was caught up
in a delicate surgey...

538
00:41:30,132 --> 00:41:31,566
...it took more time
than expected...sory.

539
00:41:31,632 --> 00:41:33,233
No issues.
You're a heart surgeon after all.

540
00:41:33,632 --> 00:41:34,766
You guessed it right.

541
00:41:34,866 --> 00:41:37,101
Matters of the heart are delicate.

542
00:41:37,299 --> 00:41:38,700
l just hope...

543
00:41:39,099 --> 00:41:40,767
. . .yOU neVer eVer
require my services...

544
00:41:40,833 --> 00:41:42,201
My heart is fine...

545
00:41:42,799 --> 00:41:44,667
...but my brain gets a
little messed up, sometimes...

546
00:41:46,699 --> 00:41:48,033
l completely understand...

547
00:41:48,099 --> 00:41:50,835
...my patients go mad too...

548
00:41:51,632 --> 00:41:52,566
...after they hear my fee...

549
00:41:52,632 --> 00:41:53,733
l can see that.

550
00:41:53,799 --> 00:41:55,800
Well...

551
00:41:56,232 --> 00:41:58,567
...l manage to earn
my bread and butter...

552
00:41:58,833 --> 00:42:02,136
What will you have?
- That's Dr. Sachin Mahajan's apartment.

553
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,067
lsn't it?

554
00:42:05,632 --> 00:42:07,834
That's Ayesha's bedroom window.

555
00:42:08,232 --> 00:42:10,033
lf the curtains were open...

556
00:42:10,866 --> 00:42:13,201
...one could see who's
coming in there, or going out.

557
00:42:13,866 --> 00:42:15,000
What do you say?

558
00:42:16,632 --> 00:42:18,233
Brinda...

559
00:42:18,699 --> 00:42:19,966
You two haven't met...

560
00:42:20,566 --> 00:42:21,700
That's my wife, Brinda...

561
00:42:21,766 --> 00:42:23,667
Brinda, this is...
- Paraskar...

562
00:42:23,733 --> 00:42:25,901
Sunil Paraskar from the C.B.l...

563
00:42:27,099 --> 00:42:27,866
l'll see you later...

564
00:42:27,933 --> 00:42:31,603
l've seen you before, on T.V.?

565
00:42:32,466 --> 00:42:34,935
Brinda has been an
actress and model...

566
00:42:35,165 --> 00:42:37,567
...but that was before she met me.
Isn't that right, sweetheart?

567
00:42:37,632 --> 00:42:38,666
Yes.

568
00:42:39,899 --> 00:42:41,667
Why don't you sit down?

569
00:42:45,165 --> 00:42:48,034
How was your relation
with Dr. Sachin...?

570
00:42:49,165 --> 00:42:49,965
Doctor?

571
00:42:50,032 --> 00:42:51,666
He's one of my good friends.

572
00:42:52,566 --> 00:42:53,934
ln fact, he's close to me.

573
00:42:55,499 --> 00:42:56,833
And to you, Mrs. Brinda?

574
00:42:57,599 --> 00:42:59,100
l hardly know him.

575
00:43:00,399 --> 00:43:02,100
To me, he is...you could say...

576
00:43:03,466 --> 00:43:04,700
...an acquaintance.

577
00:43:04,966 --> 00:43:06,500
l see...

578
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,668
These are...

579
00:43:12,499 --> 00:43:14,734
...Dr. Mahajan's call records.

580
00:43:16,065 --> 00:43:18,600
You've called him forty-five times...

581
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,401
...in the last two months.

582
00:43:20,466 --> 00:43:21,733
We're good friends...

583
00:43:22,866 --> 00:43:24,133
And did you...

584
00:43:25,032 --> 00:43:27,701
...know about their
'friendship', doctor?

585
00:43:28,666 --> 00:43:29,967
Dr. Hansal...?

586
00:43:32,766 --> 00:43:33,733
No...

587
00:43:33,799 --> 00:43:35,000
...not really...

588
00:43:35,666 --> 00:43:39,136
You're a bigger liar than your wife.

589
00:43:41,499 --> 00:43:42,900
Mr. Paraskar...

590
00:43:43,899 --> 00:43:45,734
l must ask you to leave now.

591
00:43:55,566 --> 00:43:57,567
May l ask you to shut up now?

592
00:43:58,466 --> 00:43:59,967
l'm not here on a social visit.

593
00:44:06,466 --> 00:44:07,033
Hansal, l'll see you later.

594
00:44:07,332 --> 00:44:08,066
Sit down.

595
00:44:11,399 --> 00:44:14,802
Ma'am, sit down.

596
00:44:21,366 --> 00:44:22,834
On the 28th of August...

597
00:44:24,432 --> 00:44:25,633
...Mrs. Brinda...

598
00:44:27,799 --> 00:44:30,635
...you called Sachin in the evening...

599
00:44:31,399 --> 00:44:34,101
...and then you called
the hotel Meridian.

600
00:44:37,466 --> 00:44:42,370
l was at the Meridian this morning.

601
00:44:43,933 --> 00:44:44,867
Brinda Chhabria.

602
00:44:44,933 --> 00:44:48,403
She last booked a room
with us on 28th August.

603
00:44:49,766 --> 00:44:50,967
Had she come with this gentlemen?

604
00:44:51,032 --> 00:44:52,066
No sir...

605
00:44:52,399 --> 00:44:53,700
...not with him.

606
00:44:54,332 --> 00:44:56,600
ln fact, this gentleman...

607
00:44:56,632 --> 00:44:58,667
...had come here inquiring about her,
just like you.

608
00:44:58,899 --> 00:45:00,800
Do you have a booking
in the name of...

609
00:45:00,866 --> 00:45:01,967
...Brinda Chhabria?

610
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:03,366
Yes, Brinda Chhabria...

611
00:45:04,366 --> 00:45:06,668
Had Brinda come alone?

612
00:45:07,966 --> 00:45:09,767
No, sir.

613
00:45:09,833 --> 00:45:13,803
Another gentleman had joined her...

614
00:45:13,833 --> 00:45:17,403
...he often comes here with her.

615
00:45:17,466 --> 00:45:18,533
Was it him?

616
00:45:18,833 --> 00:45:19,900
Yes, sir.

617
00:45:19,966 --> 00:45:20,966
lt was him...

618
00:45:21,499 --> 00:45:23,467
Was there any confrontation
between these two men?

619
00:45:23,699 --> 00:45:26,768
No sir, l don't think
they spoke to each other...

620
00:45:30,399 --> 00:45:31,833
How are you so sure?

621
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:34,800
You remember eveything
in such detail...

622
00:45:35,833 --> 00:45:37,534
Sir, l remember because...

623
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:41,002
...that day this gentleman had a
brawl in the lobby, with a young lad.

624
00:45:41,265 --> 00:45:44,401
Our staff had to stop them.

625
00:45:44,466 --> 00:45:48,403
Show me the list of all
reservations you booked that day.

626
00:45:48,466 --> 00:45:49,466
That day, we had...

627
00:45:49,532 --> 00:45:51,934
Mr. Vijay Sharma, Mr.
Pradeep Singh Chauhan...

628
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,001
...Mr. Riyaz Noorani...
- Riyaz Noorani...

629
00:45:56,666 --> 00:45:57,500
Who was he with?

630
00:45:57,566 --> 00:46:00,702
A girl in her teens.

631
00:46:01,265 --> 00:46:02,265
Was it her?

632
00:46:02,332 --> 00:46:03,966
Yes, sir...it was her.

633
00:46:04,232 --> 00:46:05,800
Good morning sir...how may l help you?

634
00:46:05,866 --> 00:46:07,901

635
00:46:09,699 --> 00:46:10,332
Yes, sir.

636
00:46:10,399 --> 00:46:12,300
At the same time...

637
00:46:12,366 --> 00:46:14,501
...this gentleman was waiting
for the elevator in the lobby...

638
00:46:14,566 --> 00:46:15,566
...and...

639
00:46:25,499 --> 00:46:26,566
Dad..

640
00:46:29,799 --> 00:46:30,866
What's happening?

641
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:34,199
Dad...?

642
00:46:34,265 --> 00:46:35,833
What the hell are
you doing with this guy?

643
00:46:35,899 --> 00:46:37,567
One second, let me explain...

644
00:46:37,632 --> 00:46:39,233
Riyaz...Stop!

645
00:46:39,265 --> 00:46:40,332
Dad!...

646
00:46:40,599 --> 00:46:43,201
Riyaz, please don't...

647
00:46:44,366 --> 00:46:46,434
l am sory dad, leave him...

648
00:46:46,499 --> 00:46:48,500
Dad! Please stop!

649
00:46:48,766 --> 00:46:52,703
Dad, stop it!
Please stop!

650
00:46:52,766 --> 00:46:55,268
How dare you touch me!?

651
00:46:55,332 --> 00:46:58,468
l'll get you, you bastard!
Who the hell do you think you are...?

652
00:46:58,532 --> 00:47:01,234
Sir...please sir...relax...don't...

653
00:47:01,799 --> 00:47:02,866
And then...

654
00:47:03,132 --> 00:47:04,833
...he took the girl away.

655
00:47:04,899 --> 00:47:07,334
And the other gentleman...

656
00:47:07,399 --> 00:47:08,767
...left silently too.

657
00:47:10,699 --> 00:47:12,267
Mr. Paraskar...

658
00:47:12,599 --> 00:47:15,501
These are our personal matters...

659
00:47:16,766 --> 00:47:17,833
lf you could...

660
00:47:17,899 --> 00:47:19,734
...shield us from the public eye...

661
00:47:19,799 --> 00:47:21,867
...we'd reward you appropriately.

662
00:47:23,766 --> 00:47:26,869
According to
Dr. Sachin Mahajan's call records...

663
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:35,367
Are you hinting at a bribe?

664
00:47:35,432 --> 00:47:37,233
No. Me? When?

665
00:47:37,332 --> 00:47:39,767
You just did...

666
00:47:39,833 --> 00:47:41,301
When did l say that?

667
00:47:41,366 --> 00:47:43,468
l was tying to say
something else, that...

668
00:47:43,532 --> 00:47:44,900
Oh, so l misunderstood?

669
00:47:45,165 --> 00:47:46,266
Yes, there's been
a misunderstanding...

670
00:47:46,332 --> 00:47:47,399
Oh, ok...

671
00:47:48,366 --> 00:47:50,501
So, as per the call records...

672
00:47:50,833 --> 00:47:55,537
...you called Dr. Sachin
Mahajan at 11 p.m. that night...

673
00:47:56,466 --> 00:47:57,300
So...?

674
00:47:57,366 --> 00:47:58,633
He's a good friend...

675
00:47:59,299 --> 00:48:00,600
...l call him often...

676
00:48:01,666 --> 00:48:03,334
...what's wrong in that?

677
00:48:03,399 --> 00:48:04,700
Right...

678
00:48:11,699 --> 00:48:13,534
And quite a friend he's been...

679
00:48:14,232 --> 00:48:15,399
...right, Mrs. Brinda?

680
00:48:15,833 --> 00:48:17,668
You have no right to insult my wife...

681
00:48:23,165 --> 00:48:24,799
After dropping Ayesha home...

682
00:48:26,332 --> 00:48:28,100
Sachin Mahajan left again...

683
00:48:28,165 --> 00:48:29,432
...for hotel Meridian...

684
00:48:31,332 --> 00:48:33,534
...where Brinda was waiting for him.

685
00:48:34,199 --> 00:48:35,300
Get in...

686
00:48:37,099 --> 00:48:39,801
You're never going
to meet that boy again...

687
00:48:40,132 --> 00:48:41,466
ls that bloody clear...?

688
00:48:50,632 --> 00:48:51,833
Hey...it's been two hours...

689
00:48:52,099 --> 00:48:55,502
l know, l know...
- ...you didn't even bother to call me...

690
00:48:55,566 --> 00:48:56,633
l'm really sory.

691
00:48:56,699 --> 00:49:00,235
And then, at 11 p.m., Riyaz Noorani...

692
00:49:01,132 --> 00:49:05,269
...came to meet Ayesha
Mahajan at her apartment.

693
00:49:09,699 --> 00:49:10,766
l don't want to listen to you.

694
00:49:11,032 --> 00:49:11,766
Ayesha...

695
00:49:12,032 --> 00:49:14,401
He's my dad!
How could you hit him Riyaz!?

696
00:49:14,466 --> 00:49:17,669
Ayesha, l'm here only for you...

697
00:49:17,733 --> 00:49:23,538
And it's possible that at that time,
you might have seen Riyaz...

698
00:49:24,132 --> 00:49:25,633
...entering Ayesha's room,
from here...

699
00:49:38,065 --> 00:49:39,266
That's it...

700
00:49:40,599 --> 00:49:42,100
You got the pe_ect opportunity...

701
00:49:42,165 --> 00:49:44,133
...to repay your 'friend'...

702
00:49:55,432 --> 00:49:56,399
Hello...

703
00:49:56,466 --> 00:49:57,633
Hello, Sachin!

704
00:49:58,032 --> 00:49:59,233
...where are you?

705
00:50:00,466 --> 00:50:02,134
l'm with a patient...what's
the matter?

706
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:05,267
That Muslim boy...

707
00:50:06,432 --> 00:50:07,533
Noorani...

708
00:50:09,265 --> 00:50:12,368
He's inside Ayesha's
bedroom at the moment...

709
00:50:12,432 --> 00:50:13,766
What?
- Yes.

710
00:50:14,599 --> 00:50:15,666
l just saw him with my own eyes.

711
00:50:15,733 --> 00:50:17,501
What shit are you talking about?

712
00:50:17,566 --> 00:50:19,668
Listen, l'm coming there...
- What happened?

713
00:50:19,733 --> 00:50:22,001
l need to go.
- What happened?

714
00:50:22,065 --> 00:50:22,999
...l'll be back, Brinda.

715
00:50:23,065 --> 00:50:25,167
That's enough, Mr. Paraskar!

716
00:50:25,466 --> 00:50:27,568
What are you tying to prove!?

717
00:50:28,332 --> 00:50:31,301
You'll find out,
in court, Dr. Hansal...

718
00:50:34,065 --> 00:50:35,299
Bye.

719
00:50:39,666 --> 00:50:41,167
Parvez...
- Yes, sir...

720
00:50:41,232 --> 00:50:43,767
Hansal or Brinda?
- You got them both by their tails, sir...

721
00:50:44,032 --> 00:50:46,367
Which of them has a motive?

722
00:50:46,432 --> 00:50:47,666
Both.

723
00:50:48,065 --> 00:50:50,233
Hansal could have done
it to get even with Sachin.

724
00:50:50,332 --> 00:50:51,599
Or Brinda could have done it...

725
00:50:51,666 --> 00:50:52,700
...because she may be
wanting to mary Sachin...

726
00:50:52,766 --> 00:50:55,001
...and he might be refusing
for Ayesha's sake.

727
00:50:55,599 --> 00:50:58,368
Either of them could have
paid someone to get this done...

728
00:50:59,099 --> 00:51:01,134
Someone like...Chetan Tiwari...

729
00:51:01,199 --> 00:51:02,400
...or even Remi.

730
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,569
l spent more time with
Ayesha than her mother.

731
00:51:06,699 --> 00:51:08,467
When was Dr. Aarti ever at home?

732
00:51:08,699 --> 00:51:10,600
Your quarter is right
below Ayesha's room, right?

733
00:51:10,933 --> 00:51:15,203
Yes. - Yet,
you didn't hear anything that night?

734
00:51:16,632 --> 00:51:21,603
Actually, l'd heard something...

735
00:51:30,032 --> 00:51:31,333
A vey faint noise...

736
00:51:31,499 --> 00:51:37,271
lt was like someone was
moving the furniture upstairs.

737
00:51:38,065 --> 00:51:43,637
But then, the noise stopped.
So l went back to sleep.

738
00:51:45,232 --> 00:51:47,100
Alright, Mrs. Remi Fernandes...

739
00:51:47,299 --> 00:51:50,468
lnform Dr. Aarti
that l'm here to see her...

740
00:51:51,032 --> 00:51:53,200
Am l through?
- Yes.

741
00:51:56,432 --> 00:51:57,566
Sir...

742
00:51:57,632 --> 00:51:59,100
...one request.

743
00:51:59,566 --> 00:52:01,434
l am not 'Mrs# ...

744
00:52:02,466 --> 00:52:03,900
...just 'Miss'...

745
00:52:03,966 --> 00:52:05,100
Ok...

746
00:52:05,165 --> 00:52:07,400
..# Miss' Remi Fernandes...

747
00:52:16,032 --> 00:52:17,333
How old are these reports?

748
00:52:17,399 --> 00:52:19,300
l'd taken them the last time l came...

749
00:52:19,366 --> 00:52:20,266
lt's been four months...

750
00:52:20,332 --> 00:52:22,967
The C.B.l. is here.

751
00:52:24,499 --> 00:52:26,100
Ask them to wait.

752
00:52:26,165 --> 00:52:27,966
l'll see them in a minute.

753
00:52:31,199 --> 00:52:33,134
l've resumed work...

754
00:52:33,632 --> 00:52:35,533
...to divert my mind, but...

755
00:52:37,899 --> 00:52:39,600
...it keeps coming back to me...

756
00:52:40,199 --> 00:52:43,435
Apart from your family, who
else had the keys to your house?

757
00:52:43,933 --> 00:52:45,601
One set is with Remi...

758
00:52:45,866 --> 00:52:49,469
And another set of keys is with
Dr. Hansal Chhabria...

759
00:52:49,532 --> 00:52:52,134
...we'd kept a spare set
with him in case of emergencies.

760
00:52:53,866 --> 00:52:56,268
What do you think
of Hansal and Brinda?

761
00:52:56,532 --> 00:52:59,902
Hansal and Sachin are good friends...

762
00:53:02,032 --> 00:53:02,499
And...

763
00:53:02,566 --> 00:53:04,100
...Brinda?

764
00:53:05,366 --> 00:53:06,934
No comments, eh?

765
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,167
l don't like her...

766
00:53:11,232 --> 00:53:12,566
Oh...

767
00:53:14,833 --> 00:53:21,506
Did you know about Ayesha and Riyaz?

768
00:53:24,132 --> 00:53:25,099
No.

769
00:53:25,165 --> 00:53:28,801
Sir, Riyaz was overly
possessive about Ayesha.

770
00:53:29,232 --> 00:53:32,335
He'd often threatened her...

771
00:53:32,566 --> 00:53:35,201
l don't give a shit what
your parents think of me, Ayesha!

772
00:53:35,265 --> 00:53:37,900
The next time you
speak of breaking up...

773
00:53:39,499 --> 00:53:41,033
...l'll kill you.

774
00:53:41,366 --> 00:53:42,800
Got it?

775
00:53:43,899 --> 00:53:50,005
Sir, he dropped out of college,
he's a hooligan...a goon.

776
00:53:56,532 --> 00:54:00,469
Did you know about this?

777
00:54:00,733 --> 00:54:03,769
Sachin had mentioned
that Riyaz and his friends...

778
00:54:03,966 --> 00:54:05,033
...weren't good company.

779
00:54:05,366 --> 00:54:07,167
Hey skin-head...next weekend...

780
00:54:07,232 --> 00:54:08,266
...we're going to Lonavala...alright?

781
00:54:08,332 --> 00:54:10,934
No, let's go to Goa instead...
- No dude...Lonavala.

782
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,102
No, Goa...

783
00:54:13,899 --> 00:54:15,467
Let's ty Alibaug.

784
00:54:15,733 --> 00:54:16,867
No, Lonavala will be more fun...

785
00:54:16,933 --> 00:54:17,400
Alibaug guys...

786
00:54:17,466 --> 00:54:22,270
''Who's that!?
She makes my heart go ga-ga!''

787
00:54:25,933 --> 00:54:28,268
'Ga-ga'...?

788
00:54:28,833 --> 00:54:29,466
Parvez...

789
00:54:29,733 --> 00:54:30,733
...round them up...

790
00:54:30,766 --> 00:54:32,167
What have we done? Sir?

791
00:54:32,232 --> 00:54:33,099
Sir...

792
00:55:09,899 --> 00:55:10,766
Sir...

793
00:55:10,833 --> 00:55:12,334
...you can't do this.

794
00:55:12,399 --> 00:55:15,835
We know the law, you can't touch us...

795
00:55:15,899 --> 00:55:17,667
...we're entitled
to call for a lamer...

796
00:55:17,733 --> 00:55:19,401
Sir! Please sir...

797
00:55:19,666 --> 00:55:22,268
...please let me go...

798
00:55:46,065 --> 00:55:47,433
Have you acted before?

799
00:55:50,199 --> 00:55:50,866
Sir?

800
00:55:50,933 --> 00:55:53,268
'Acting'...have you acted before?

801
00:55:54,966 --> 00:55:56,300
No.

802
00:55:57,199 --> 00:55:59,234
What oozes out
when one gets beaten?

803
00:55:59,766 --> 00:56:00,366
Sir...

804
00:56:00,632 --> 00:56:02,633
Not from down there,
from up here...

805
00:56:02,966 --> 00:56:05,034
One screams, sir...

806
00:56:05,099 --> 00:56:06,767
Yes.

807
00:56:06,799 --> 00:56:08,233
So, scream as loud as you can...

808
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:10,366
...or else you'll get it for real...

809
00:56:11,332 --> 00:56:14,134
No! Sir please! No!

810
00:56:15,799 --> 00:56:17,333
Sir please! No!

811
00:56:18,866 --> 00:56:21,735
No! Sir please!

812
00:56:22,265 --> 00:56:23,699
Sir please!

813
00:56:24,666 --> 00:56:28,136
No! Sir please! No!

814
00:56:52,265 --> 00:56:54,266
Yes, now...

815
00:56:55,032 --> 00:56:56,600
...tell me about the law...

816
00:56:56,799 --> 00:57:03,305
Sir...Riyaz wanted to elope with
Ayesha. He'd planned it out with us...

817
00:57:03,566 --> 00:57:07,636
But Ayesha refused consistently.
We know nothing else, sir...

818
00:57:07,699 --> 00:57:09,934
We don't know anything else, sir...

819
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,068
We don't know where he
is now...we haven't heard from him...

820
00:57:12,132 --> 00:57:13,299
We don't know.

821
00:57:13,566 --> 00:57:15,534
We don't know where he is now...

822
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:17,033
He hasn't contacted
us since then, sir...

823
00:57:17,099 --> 00:57:19,601
...we are telling the truth, sir...
l swear...

824
00:57:30,799 --> 00:57:32,901
Wow, sir! That was too cool!

825
00:57:32,966 --> 00:57:34,634
You screwed them inside out.

826
00:57:34,699 --> 00:57:36,033
Thank you so much sir,
for letting me act...

827
00:57:38,866 --> 00:57:42,803
Aah, been a while
since l've done that...

828
00:57:44,132 --> 00:57:45,766
...enjoyed it thoroughly...

829
00:57:46,299 --> 00:57:47,266
Let's have lunch?

830
00:57:47,532 --> 00:57:49,100
Yes, sir.
- Start.

831
00:57:49,966 --> 00:57:53,936
lt's possible that
Riyaz killed Ayesha.

832
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,602
Or maybe he got her
killed by Chetan Tiwari.

833
00:57:56,866 --> 00:57:58,167
What could be the motive, sir?

834
00:57:58,733 --> 00:58:01,702
Possessiveness.

835
00:58:02,566 --> 00:58:03,900
What's your lunch?

836
00:58:03,966 --> 00:58:05,133
Egg sandwich?

837
00:58:06,599 --> 00:58:08,534
Same old dish.

838
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:14,504
Ayesha may have insisted
on ending their relation that night...

839
00:58:14,699 --> 00:58:16,634
...that could have
triggered him off...

840
00:58:16,899 --> 00:58:20,636
Sir, we'll know the truth
once we nab Chetan Tiwari.

841
00:58:21,532 --> 00:58:24,935
Chetan's brother-in-law...
Sudhakar Mishra.

842
00:58:25,933 --> 00:58:27,034
Keep an eye on him.

843
00:58:57,132 --> 00:58:58,600
Sir...

844
00:58:58,866 --> 00:59:02,035
...he's left his place, like evey
night, he's carying a bag as usual.

845
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,101
Sir!

846
00:59:59,432 --> 01:00:01,801
Kanheri caves?

847
01:00:05,666 --> 01:00:07,501
Kanheri caves?

848
01:00:17,165 --> 01:00:19,100
Where did he want to go?

849
01:00:19,165 --> 01:00:20,933
Borivali National Park...

850
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,401
Kanheri caves.

851
01:00:32,499 --> 01:00:34,067
Sir, l'm at Kanheri caves...

852
01:00:35,099 --> 01:00:37,434
Sir, he's ahead of me...

853
01:01:03,399 --> 01:01:04,833
Tell me...
- Sir, he's right ahead of me...

854
01:01:04,899 --> 01:01:06,066
l can see him.

855
01:01:06,766 --> 01:01:09,835
Conceal yourself...

856
01:01:10,332 --> 01:01:11,599
Don't stop him. Let him pass.

857
01:01:11,833 --> 01:01:13,734
l want to see who's he feeding?

858
01:01:13,799 --> 01:01:14,866
Okay, sir.

859
01:03:05,265 --> 01:03:06,232
Yeah, Parvez...

860
01:03:06,299 --> 01:03:08,200
Yes, sir...did you see someone?

861
01:03:09,733 --> 01:03:11,201
There were two of them...

862
01:03:11,632 --> 01:03:12,599
...they got away...

863
01:03:12,766 --> 01:03:14,267
But sir, who were they?

864
01:03:47,232 --> 01:03:48,299
Open the tiffin box.

865
01:03:57,132 --> 01:03:58,433
Taste it.
- Sir...

866
01:03:58,499 --> 01:04:00,601
Don't wory, we're in a hospital.

867
01:04:10,265 --> 01:04:11,699
What is it?

868
01:04:12,165 --> 01:04:14,133
lt's beef, sir.

869
01:04:15,265 --> 01:04:19,502
Would Chetan 'Tiwari'
a Hindu Brahmin eat be_f?

870
01:04:19,899 --> 01:04:21,300
Not possible, sir.

871
01:04:22,466 --> 01:04:23,500
Are you done?

872
01:04:23,566 --> 01:04:25,200
One second, sir...
- Get lost!

873
01:04:25,265 --> 01:04:26,633
Will you operate on me next?

874
01:04:28,733 --> 01:04:30,134
Show me the knife...

875
01:04:37,699 --> 01:04:39,500
A butcher's blade...

876
01:04:39,733 --> 01:04:43,236
No fingerprints, l'm sure.
The handle is covered by cloth.

877
01:04:43,632 --> 01:04:44,699
No, sir.

878
01:04:45,299 --> 01:04:46,166
Clever.

879
01:04:46,232 --> 01:04:50,235
Cloth handle with an uneven su_ace,
impossible to extract fingerprints.

880
01:04:50,799 --> 01:04:52,567
But sir, who do you
think was inside the caves?

881
01:04:54,332 --> 01:04:55,499
Riyaz Noorani?

882
01:04:56,666 --> 01:04:58,067
And who was...

883
01:04:58,132 --> 01:05:00,267
...the other man who attacked you?

884
01:05:01,599 --> 01:05:03,133
Chetan Tiwari?

885
01:05:03,366 --> 01:05:04,800
He might have gone to meet Riyaz...

886
01:05:06,065 --> 01:05:08,100
Sudhakar Mishra will
give us all the answers.

887
01:05:08,766 --> 01:05:09,666
Take him in custody, now.

888
01:05:09,733 --> 01:05:10,767
Sir...

889
01:05:11,566 --> 01:05:13,334
...we received a call.

890
01:05:15,099 --> 01:05:15,766
Saying what?

891
01:05:15,833 --> 01:05:17,334
Sudhakar has not reached home.

892
01:05:40,265 --> 01:05:41,165
Did he fall off a moving train?

893
01:05:41,232 --> 01:05:43,467
Yes sir, it seems he
fell off a moving train...

894
01:05:44,632 --> 01:05:46,100
Did you find a tiffin box,
near his body?

895
01:05:46,165 --> 01:05:47,199
Tiffin...?

896
01:05:49,566 --> 01:05:51,334
You're from Mumbai, right?
- Yes, sir.

897
01:05:51,499 --> 01:05:52,733
Don't you know what a tiffin box is?

898
01:05:53,199 --> 01:05:54,433
Hey, was there a tiffin
box next to this body?

899
01:05:54,499 --> 01:05:56,701
No sir, we didn't find
any tiffin box next to the body.

900
01:06:04,366 --> 01:06:06,101
Sunil...
- Hmm...

901
01:06:06,332 --> 01:06:07,566
This cut...

902
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:08,700
What about it?

903
01:06:08,766 --> 01:06:11,335
Sunil, anything could have happened...

904
01:06:11,399 --> 01:06:13,601
lt's nothing...just a scratch...

905
01:06:15,666 --> 01:06:17,234
Are you done, nurse Asha?

906
01:06:17,766 --> 01:06:20,568
l'm really sory.

907
01:06:20,766 --> 01:06:22,100
Sory...

908
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:30,070
Didn't Hansal Chhabria
offer you something?

909
01:06:31,399 --> 01:06:32,500
Yeah, so?

910
01:06:33,699 --> 01:06:35,333
Why don't you accept the offer?

911
01:06:38,632 --> 01:06:40,100
Get aside...!

912
01:06:42,366 --> 01:06:43,500
Sunil...

913
01:07:02,466 --> 01:07:03,433
Sunil...

914
01:07:03,499 --> 01:07:05,067
To tell you the truth...

915
01:07:05,232 --> 01:07:08,301
...you are the most
selfish person l've met.

916
01:07:09,432 --> 01:07:12,334
Your ego means more
to you than your children.

917
01:07:13,132 --> 01:07:15,234
This whole fracas
is an ego trip for you.

918
01:07:15,666 --> 01:07:20,037
You care a damn for your family!

919
01:07:36,366 --> 01:07:37,967
Hello...Riyaz...

920
01:07:38,032 --> 01:07:39,233
Your mother is worried sick...

921
01:07:39,299 --> 01:07:40,667
...she's asking you
to come back home...

922
01:07:42,199 --> 01:07:44,568
...forget all this now...

923
01:07:45,232 --> 01:07:47,334
...just come back.
Listen...

924
01:07:48,232 --> 01:07:53,337
l'm speaking to you
because your mom told me to...

925
01:07:55,599 --> 01:07:57,434
Do you know the C.B.l.
had rounded us up?

926
01:07:57,499 --> 01:08:00,134
This is getting serious now...so
just come back while you still can...

927
01:08:00,199 --> 01:08:01,500
...hello...hello...

928
01:09:32,566 --> 01:09:33,500
Take him away...

929
01:09:40,299 --> 01:09:41,299
Parvez...!

930
01:12:06,332 --> 01:12:12,371
Tell me! What happened
in the apartment that night!?

931
01:13:27,599 --> 01:13:28,833
Sir, l'm sure...

932
01:13:29,232 --> 01:13:31,701
Chetan Tiwari and
Riyaz are hand-in-glove.

933
01:13:34,799 --> 01:13:35,332
Sir...

934
01:13:35,599 --> 01:13:37,167
Riyaz Noorani has been located.

935
01:14:56,966 --> 01:14:58,100
Sudhakar Mishra's house...

936
01:14:58,165 --> 01:14:59,466
Open it.

937
01:15:26,232 --> 01:15:27,533
Pick this up...

938
01:15:55,866 --> 01:15:57,400
Silver.

939
01:15:57,766 --> 01:15:58,766
Sir, if you recall...

940
01:15:58,833 --> 01:16:02,736
...Dr. Sachin had silver
cutley at his house too.

941
01:16:05,132 --> 01:16:06,032
Come...

942
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,035
Chetan pocketed these
spoons from here.

943
01:16:24,032 --> 01:16:26,434
But then, if Chetan
took away meagre belongings...

944
01:16:28,499 --> 01:16:29,933
...like his toothbrush, comb, etc...

945
01:16:32,766 --> 01:16:35,869
Why would he leave behind
a silver spoon in Sudhakar's house?

946
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:40,002
Maybe for safekeeping,
maybe he just didn't get the time.

947
01:16:47,899 --> 01:16:50,468
The evidence is in this house.

948
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:52,501
Think Parvez, think hard!

949
01:16:55,099 --> 01:16:56,066
Sir...

950
01:17:12,366 --> 01:17:13,467
Parvez...

951
01:17:15,566 --> 01:17:16,566
...come, sit...

952
01:17:17,966 --> 01:17:19,400
Oh! Sory...

953
01:17:31,065 --> 01:17:32,032
This pair, sir?

954
01:17:32,099 --> 01:17:33,033
Yes...

955
01:17:41,766 --> 01:17:43,667
Male...size 7...

956
01:17:44,799 --> 01:17:45,966
They are Chetan's, for sure...

957
01:17:48,499 --> 01:17:49,900
Obviously, Remi wouldn't wear these...

958
01:17:50,966 --> 01:17:52,367
When he ran off with eveything...

959
01:17:52,632 --> 01:17:53,866
...why did he leave his shoes behind?

960
01:17:55,733 --> 01:17:56,834
Come...

961
01:17:57,632 --> 01:17:59,000
Chetan's room...?
- Yes, that one sir...

962
01:17:59,265 --> 01:18:00,666
Servant's bathroom?
- That one sir...

963
01:18:01,599 --> 01:18:05,970
Go upstairs...enter Ayesha's
room and come out. Quick!

964
01:18:27,499 --> 01:18:28,600
Parvez...

965
01:18:30,899 --> 01:18:31,799
Sir...

966
01:18:32,366 --> 01:18:33,800
Remi's quarter is below this, right?

967
01:18:35,666 --> 01:18:36,800
Yes, sir. Right below this.

968
01:18:38,566 --> 01:18:39,900
Actually, l'd heard something...

969
01:18:39,966 --> 01:18:42,001
...like someone was moving
the furniture upstairs...

970
01:18:42,265 --> 01:18:43,666
...a vey faint noise...

971
01:18:43,933 --> 01:18:46,902
Move the furniture from this spot...

972
01:19:45,733 --> 01:19:46,834
Get a screwdriver...

973
01:20:06,699 --> 01:20:09,902
Chetan's toothbrush, comb
and eveything else is right here.

974
01:20:28,466 --> 01:20:34,872
l want you to fight
Dr. Sachin Mahajan's case...

975
01:20:36,265 --> 01:20:37,199
You see...

976
01:20:37,265 --> 01:20:38,866
l'm almost retired now.

977
01:20:39,332 --> 01:20:41,867
l take up only select cases.

978
01:20:42,966 --> 01:20:47,437
l can't take this case. l'm sory.

979
01:20:49,532 --> 01:20:53,569
Mr. Ajwani, you've rarely
ever lost a case in your career.

980
01:20:54,833 --> 01:20:57,302
This case really
needs your expertise.

981
01:20:58,866 --> 01:21:00,567
Please reconsider...

982
01:21:01,466 --> 01:21:02,633
Mrs. Brinda...

983
01:21:02,866 --> 01:21:05,602
l am really sory.

984
01:21:13,299 --> 01:21:14,633
Please...

985
01:21:21,165 --> 01:21:22,533
Please...

986
01:21:34,299 --> 01:21:38,403
This is a classic case of a frame-up,
your honour.

987
01:21:38,733 --> 01:21:42,536
The scratches found on
Dr. Sachin Mahajan's...

988
01:21:42,599 --> 01:21:45,335
...and Ayesha Mahajan's bodies...

989
01:21:45,532 --> 01:21:51,471
...prove that there was
a struggle between them.

990
01:21:51,666 --> 01:21:54,201
That does not prove...

991
01:21:54,432 --> 01:21:56,300
...that Dr. Sachin Mahajan...

992
01:21:57,065 --> 01:21:58,666
...murdered Ayesha.

993
01:21:59,132 --> 01:22:01,801
Dr. Sachin Mahajan is Ayesha's father.

994
01:22:03,099 --> 01:22:08,504
That night, he might have
beaten her up, to discipline her.

995
01:22:08,766 --> 01:22:10,334
And in that struggle...

996
01:22:10,632 --> 01:22:15,136
...they could have scratched
each other with their nails.

997
01:22:15,199 --> 01:22:16,533
And it's possible...

998
01:22:17,099 --> 01:22:18,667
...that some third person
may have seen them...

999
01:22:19,399 --> 01:22:21,467
...and taken advantage.

1000
01:22:23,299 --> 01:22:26,669
The blood reports have established...

1001
01:22:26,733 --> 01:22:31,304
...that Dr. Sachin Mahajan
was heavily drunk that night.

1002
01:22:34,833 --> 01:22:38,169
This is a carefully
planned double murder...

1003
01:22:38,232 --> 01:22:41,668
...not an act of drunken impulse.

1004
01:22:41,733 --> 01:22:49,540
lt's impossible that a heavily
drunk Dr. Sachin could've done it.

1005
01:23:24,199 --> 01:23:29,537
Dr. Sachin Mahajan is
granted anticipatoy bail.

1006
01:24:04,265 --> 01:24:06,300
Give me the bag...
- No, l'm fine...

1007
01:24:09,199 --> 01:24:13,136
Aarti, l've been waiting
to tell you this since years...

1008
01:24:13,466 --> 01:24:15,367
One second...
- Just listen...

1009
01:24:16,632 --> 01:24:17,632
Please, Aarti.

1010
01:24:18,566 --> 01:24:21,268
l was concerned about Ayesha...

1011
01:24:22,199 --> 01:24:24,634
...it would affect her mind,
her studies...

1012
01:24:26,099 --> 01:24:30,403
...custody cases have
an adverse effect on kids.

1013
01:24:32,332 --> 01:24:33,499
But now, l think...

1014
01:24:34,299 --> 01:24:36,367
...there's no point in continuing...

1015
01:24:37,933 --> 01:24:39,367
...this mechanical marriage of ours...

1016
01:24:44,933 --> 01:24:45,933
You and Brinda...?

1017
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:47,067
Yes...

1018
01:24:47,265 --> 01:24:48,532
Since a long time...right?

1019
01:24:48,599 --> 01:24:51,268
lt's not what you think...

1020
01:24:51,366 --> 01:24:53,167
She's taking you for a ride...
- No, she's not, that's not true...

1021
01:24:53,232 --> 01:24:55,367
She's tying to...
- Can you just take her away Remi, please?

1022
01:24:55,432 --> 01:24:59,435
No...just listen to me, Sachin...

1023
01:24:59,499 --> 01:25:01,167
We'll talk about this but not here...

1024
01:25:01,232 --> 01:25:02,066
...don't create a scene here!

1025
01:25:02,099 --> 01:25:03,066
Listen to me, Sachin...

1026
01:25:03,132 --> 01:25:04,900
She's taking you for a ride...
- we'll talk about it...

1027
01:25:04,966 --> 01:25:06,467
Sachin, just listen to me...

1028
01:25:07,399 --> 01:25:10,135
She's taking you
for a ride Goddamnit!

1029
01:25:24,432 --> 01:25:26,433
We've spent so much time here.

1030
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:31,303
l have a surprise for you.
Go in.

1031
01:25:44,866 --> 01:25:46,033
Home...?

1032
01:25:46,366 --> 01:25:50,036
For a few days,
this hotel suite will be our home.

1033
01:26:19,566 --> 01:26:21,067
Excuse me, ma'am...

1034
01:26:22,132 --> 01:26:24,133
l'm Sachin's friend...Mahesh Limaye.

1035
01:26:24,199 --> 01:26:25,400
Oh...

1036
01:26:28,466 --> 01:26:30,401
J
l'd come here from Mumbai
for some work...

1037
01:26:30,466 --> 01:26:33,235
...Sachin sent these sweets for you.

1038
01:26:33,532 --> 01:26:34,966
Sweets?

1039
01:26:35,165 --> 01:26:37,534
He didn't call me about this...

1040
01:26:38,432 --> 01:26:41,101
Must have slipped his mind...

1041
01:26:43,933 --> 01:26:44,900
Anyway...thank you, ma'am...

1042
01:26:44,966 --> 01:26:48,803
Wait, come in,
you can't just leave like this...

1043
01:26:48,866 --> 01:26:49,566
No ma'am, it's pe_ectly fine...

1044
01:26:49,833 --> 01:26:51,000
Have a cup of tea at least...

1045
01:26:51,065 --> 01:26:52,900
No, ma'am, thanks a lot...
- Come, son...

1046
01:26:52,933 --> 01:26:54,067
Ok...

1047
01:26:55,099 --> 01:26:56,333
You haven't even tasted anything...

1048
01:26:56,399 --> 01:26:59,135
No ma'am, thanks... - have something,
at least... - l'll have this...

1049
01:26:59,199 --> 01:27:00,466
...it looks good...

1050
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:06,770
So, when are you
visiting Mumbai next?

1051
01:27:07,032 --> 01:27:08,266
Not sure...

1052
01:27:10,799 --> 01:27:14,335
Sachin, Aarti, Remi
they talk about you all the' time.

1053
01:27:17,432 --> 01:27:18,866
What's the matter, ma'am?

1054
01:27:19,265 --> 01:27:22,501
ls Mr. Mahajan not too fond of Remi?

1055
01:27:23,299 --> 01:27:25,434
Curious, aren't you?

1056
01:27:26,099 --> 01:27:28,434
Are you really Sachin's friend...

1057
01:27:29,032 --> 01:27:30,733
...or someone else?

1058
01:27:33,132 --> 01:27:34,833
Now that you've figured it out,

1059
01:27:36,366 --> 01:27:39,435
...tell me about Ayesha's murder.

1060
01:27:39,933 --> 01:27:41,768
By the way, my name is Paraskar...

1061
01:27:42,265 --> 01:27:44,233
Sunil Paraskar from the C.B.l.

1062
01:27:45,332 --> 01:27:47,067
We don't know anything.

1063
01:27:49,933 --> 01:27:52,235
l don't understand you.

1064
01:27:52,933 --> 01:27:55,769
Sachin is your son,
Ayesha was your grand-daughter.

1065
01:27:56,032 --> 01:27:57,800
They are not my family,

1066
01:27:57,866 --> 01:28:04,038
...yet, l was attacked.

1067
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:06,267
l could've been killed.

1068
01:28:06,866 --> 01:28:10,436
My wife pesters me day
and night to accept bribes...

1069
01:28:11,332 --> 01:28:13,033
She's worried that
if l die,...

1070
01:28:13,666 --> 01:28:15,167
...how'll she support the kids?

1071
01:28:16,065 --> 01:28:17,332
Anyway, thanks for the tea.

1072
01:28:17,399 --> 01:28:21,703
These sweets are good.

1073
01:28:21,766 --> 01:28:23,200
Please do taste them.

1074
01:28:25,699 --> 01:28:28,034
We don't know what happened there.

1075
01:28:28,399 --> 01:28:32,803
But, beware of that woman Remi,...

1076
01:28:34,332 --> 01:28:38,736
...she's capable of anything.

1077
01:28:42,232 --> 01:28:43,299
Parvez...

1078
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:46,934
Yes, sir...

1079
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,202
Were you on Sudhakar Mishra's
tail on the night of 18th Oct.?

1080
01:28:49,265 --> 01:28:50,666
Yes, sir.

1081
01:28:50,699 --> 01:28:52,133
Repeat all that you
saw at Borivali station.

1082
01:28:52,199 --> 01:28:53,400
Why sir?

1083
01:28:54,199 --> 01:28:55,900
Was my pop sipping lemonade there!?

1084
01:28:56,366 --> 01:28:59,068
Oh yes...Remi...Remi Fernandes...

1085
01:28:59,632 --> 01:29:01,667
Call her for an interrogation, now.

1086
01:29:01,733 --> 01:29:02,733
Ok, sir.

1087
01:29:05,833 --> 01:29:08,101
Where were you on
the night of 18th October?

1088
01:29:09,866 --> 01:29:11,100
18th October...

1089
01:29:12,766 --> 01:29:14,234
l don't know sir...

1090
01:29:16,132 --> 01:29:18,634
Who was sipping lemonade
at Borivali station then?

1091
01:29:19,866 --> 01:29:21,968
Borivali station?

1092
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,168
l must have gone to meet my mother...

1093
01:29:29,899 --> 01:29:31,166
Where does your mother stay?

1094
01:29:32,032 --> 01:29:33,233
Vasai...

1095
01:29:35,165 --> 01:29:37,100
So, what were you doing
at Borivali station then?

1096
01:29:37,332 --> 01:29:38,266
Came to drink lemonade, eh?

1097
01:29:38,332 --> 01:29:39,866
No...

1098
01:29:41,065 --> 01:29:43,300
There's no direct train to Vasai.

1099
01:29:43,766 --> 01:29:47,870
So l change trains
at Borivali station.

1100
01:29:58,032 --> 01:29:59,633
Remi Fernandes...

1101
01:30:06,165 --> 01:30:07,866
Sir...please...

1102
01:30:08,733 --> 01:30:10,167
Where's Mr. Fernandes?

1103
01:30:10,699 --> 01:30:12,700
There's no Mr. Fernandes...

1104
01:30:13,165 --> 01:30:15,066
...l'm not married...

1105
01:30:26,265 --> 01:30:28,033
Any affair?

1106
01:30:30,366 --> 01:30:32,034
Any affair?

1107
01:30:32,199 --> 01:30:35,936
No, sir...

1108
01:30:37,065 --> 01:30:39,000
Why are you joking sir?

1109
01:30:46,199 --> 01:30:47,600
Am l joking?

1110
01:30:47,866 --> 01:30:49,634
Am l joking!?

1111
01:30:50,332 --> 01:30:52,233

1114
01:31:00,032 --> 01:31:03,602
l swear on God and cross my heart.

1115
01:31:03,666 --> 01:31:07,603
l've not done anything...
sir...please...

1116
01:31:07,666 --> 01:31:09,701
Take her for a complete
medical check-up, now!

1117
01:31:09,766 --> 01:31:11,801
Please, sir...

1118
01:31:11,833 --> 01:31:15,536
Come...
- Sir, please...

1119
01:31:15,599 --> 01:31:16,933
Come...
- Please...

1120
01:31:16,966 --> 01:31:19,902
Sir, please...
- Come...

1121
01:31:19,966 --> 01:31:21,767
Sir...

1122
01:31:26,132 --> 01:31:28,234
This woman is sexually active.

1123
01:31:28,799 --> 01:31:32,202
She has even given birth,
at least once.

1124
01:31:55,065 --> 01:32:01,504
When did your daughter
Remi visit you last?

1125
01:32:02,799 --> 01:32:03,799
Tell me...

1126
01:32:03,866 --> 01:32:06,835
When was the last time
Remi came to meet you?

1127
01:32:09,132 --> 01:32:10,533
She does not remember.

1128
01:32:10,599 --> 01:32:12,167
She's got Alzheimer's.

1129
01:32:12,232 --> 01:32:14,534
She can't remember much.

1130
01:32:19,566 --> 01:32:25,104
Remi's husband does
not let her come here...

1131
01:32:25,632 --> 01:32:27,533
What is she saying?

1132
01:32:27,733 --> 01:32:29,034
She's saying that...

1133
01:32:29,099 --> 01:32:32,035
...Remi's husband does
not allow Remi to come here.

1134
01:32:32,065 --> 01:32:33,466
Remi's 'husband'?

1135
01:32:33,532 --> 01:32:34,599
Yes.

1136
01:32:42,099 --> 01:32:43,233
Ma'am...

1137
01:32:44,499 --> 01:32:46,534
What's Remi's husband's name?

1138
01:32:47,065 --> 01:32:48,766
He's asking you...

1139
01:32:48,833 --> 01:32:51,535
What's Remi's husband's name?

1140
01:32:52,499 --> 01:32:54,767
What's Remi's husband's name?

1141
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:57,501
She doesn't remember.

1142
01:32:57,566 --> 01:33:00,635
lf you could ask her
one more time, please...

1143
01:33:00,833 --> 01:33:03,669
l'm sory, it's her time to rest...

1144
01:33:03,733 --> 01:33:06,869
...we can't risk stressing
her out too much.

1145
01:33:19,966 --> 01:33:22,001
Have you ever seen Remi's husband?

1146
01:33:22,733 --> 01:33:23,867
No.

1147
01:33:31,899 --> 01:33:37,738
Remi was vey beautiful
when she was young...

1148
01:33:37,799 --> 01:33:39,133
She says...

1149
01:33:39,399 --> 01:33:43,569
Remi was vey beautiful in her youth...

1150
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:52,800
Yes, sir. Tell me...

1151
01:33:52,833 --> 01:33:54,701
Sachin's phone is not reachable,
where is he right now?

1152
01:33:54,733 --> 01:33:56,468
Sir, he's moved with
Brinda to the hotel Meridian.

1153
01:33:56,532 --> 01:33:57,766
Take your team and reach
Meridian quickly, now!

1154
01:33:57,833 --> 01:33:58,833
Sir? What's the matter?

1155
01:33:58,866 --> 01:34:00,767
Sachin could be in danger,
get there now, fast!

1156
01:34:00,833 --> 01:34:01,800
Ok, sir.

1157
01:34:14,966 --> 01:34:16,634
We were at the lobby...

1158
01:34:16,699 --> 01:34:21,637
...when the room service
person called us from this suite...

1159
01:34:21,699 --> 01:34:23,033
Sir, he's killed himself.

1160
01:34:24,065 --> 01:34:25,900
Out of guilt, probably.

1161
01:35:40,366 --> 01:35:41,900
Did anyone ask for
a duplicate swipe card?

1162
01:35:42,032 --> 01:35:43,666
No sir. No chance.

1163
01:35:43,899 --> 01:35:45,567
We are vey strict about that.

1164
01:35:57,799 --> 01:35:58,599
Parvez...

1165
01:35:58,766 --> 01:35:59,733
Sir...

1166
01:36:00,466 --> 01:36:01,466
Assemble all of them inside Dr.
Sachin's apartment...

1167
01:36:01,532 --> 01:36:03,233
...tomorrow,
first thing in the morning.

1168
01:36:03,299 --> 01:36:04,533
Alright sir, l'll do it.

1169
01:36:29,799 --> 01:36:33,602
The 28th of August, Dr.
Sachin Mahajan, drunk to the bone...

1170
01:36:33,666 --> 01:36:35,734
...reached his
apartment at midnight...

1171
01:36:59,366 --> 01:37:00,533
Dad?

1172
01:37:03,466 --> 01:37:04,633
Dad?

1173
01:37:06,699 --> 01:37:07,566
Dad?

1174
01:37:07,599 --> 01:37:09,534
Ayesha wait, l'll explain...

1175
01:37:10,699 --> 01:37:14,536
Sir, we were tying
to sort things out...

1176
01:37:14,599 --> 01:37:16,500
Dad! Dad!

1177
01:37:16,566 --> 01:37:19,568
Dad! No! Please!

1178
01:37:27,632 --> 01:37:28,699
Dad!

1179
01:37:34,466 --> 01:37:36,267
Dr. Sachin Mahajan
genuinely did not remember...

1180
01:37:36,566 --> 01:37:38,701
...whatever happened after that.

1181
01:37:40,265 --> 01:37:41,566
Dad...

1182
01:37:42,165 --> 01:37:43,466
Dad...

1183
01:37:44,165 --> 01:37:45,266
ls there blood?

1184
01:37:46,599 --> 01:37:47,833
There's no blood...

1185
01:37:47,899 --> 01:37:49,333
lt's a swelling...

1186
01:37:53,265 --> 01:37:54,432
Sory...

1187
01:38:01,499 --> 01:38:02,766
At that time...

1188
01:38:04,733 --> 01:38:06,568
Remi and Chetan...

1189
01:38:06,632 --> 01:38:09,134
...were fast asleep inside
their respective quarters.

1190
01:38:10,065 --> 01:38:10,832
Careful, Riyaz...

1191
01:38:11,099 --> 01:38:12,633
Careful...
- Keep your calm...

1192
01:38:12,666 --> 01:38:15,101
l just hope dad doesn't
remember all this tomorrow...

1193
01:38:15,165 --> 01:38:16,399
Whenever he drinks too much...

1194
01:38:16,432 --> 01:38:17,766
...he doesn't remember
much the next day...

1195
01:38:17,833 --> 01:38:19,568
Let's hope he doesn't remember this...

1196
01:38:19,632 --> 01:38:20,799
Ayesha, the knife...

1197
01:38:21,399 --> 01:38:22,533
Oh, shit...come...

1198
01:38:24,466 --> 01:38:25,733
Just pick it up...

1199
01:38:35,366 --> 01:38:37,768
Alright, just leave now...
- l'm leaving, you take care...

1200
01:38:43,599 --> 01:38:47,102
l think Hansal would be able
to tell us what happened next...

1201
01:38:49,332 --> 01:38:51,701
That's right. l did call
Sachin to tell him about Riyaz.

1202
01:38:52,099 --> 01:38:53,600
l wanted to get back at Sachin.

1203
01:38:55,399 --> 01:38:58,301
But l did not kill
that cute little girl...

1204
01:38:58,733 --> 01:39:00,167
Why would l...?

1205
01:39:00,566 --> 01:39:01,633
But...

1206
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:05,301
l know who killed her...

1207
01:39:05,666 --> 01:39:06,566
Who?

1208
01:39:06,632 --> 01:39:10,168
Your beautiful wife...
l mean ex-wife, Brinda?

1209
01:39:12,399 --> 01:39:14,467
Brinda doesn't have the
guts to do this sort of thing...

1210
01:39:14,733 --> 01:39:16,034
Do you, Brinda?

1211
01:39:19,299 --> 01:39:22,001
Then, who do you think did it?

1212
01:39:25,299 --> 01:39:26,433
This woman!

1213
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:28,134
Wrong!

1214
01:39:29,165 --> 01:39:32,067
How can a mother kill her own child?

1215
01:39:35,699 --> 01:39:37,500
How can a mother kill her own child?

1216
01:39:38,599 --> 01:39:40,000
Am l right?

1217
01:39:42,099 --> 01:39:45,402
You were in a relation with Sachin,
since an early age...

1218
01:39:45,466 --> 01:39:46,433
Sir...?

1219
01:39:46,632 --> 01:39:47,632
A physical relation...

1220
01:39:47,699 --> 01:39:49,033
Sir, please...

1221
01:39:51,599 --> 01:39:53,500
Sir...

1222
01:39:54,666 --> 01:39:58,536
And this relation continued
till you both were grown up...

1223
01:40:01,566 --> 01:40:03,167
No, sir.
- Right.

1224
01:40:03,232 --> 01:40:04,533
Sir, please...

1225
01:40:04,599 --> 01:40:07,635
No, ma'am...

1226
01:40:11,566 --> 01:40:15,670
You could never be
Mrs. Sachin Mahajan...

1227
01:40:16,632 --> 01:40:22,704
...so you settled with being
Mrs. Remi Mahajan, didn't you?

1228
01:40:23,666 --> 01:40:28,470
l won't use the word
'mistress' or 'keep'...

1229
01:40:28,532 --> 01:40:30,634
Sir, please...

1230
01:40:30,699 --> 01:40:32,267
Since l really respect women...

1231
01:40:32,399 --> 01:40:33,366
No, no, don't get me wrong Remi...

1232
01:40:33,466 --> 01:40:35,668
...l'm saying, you
really loved Sachin...

1233
01:40:35,699 --> 01:40:36,633
Please...l beg you...

1234
01:40:36,666 --> 01:40:40,436
You loved him so much that you
could have done anything for him...

1235
01:40:41,432 --> 01:40:43,267
That's why he kept you with him,
didn't he?

1236
01:40:43,666 --> 01:40:46,268
Please...

1237
01:40:48,232 --> 01:40:52,102
And then, one day,
you gave him some 'good' news...

1238
01:40:53,332 --> 01:40:54,533
Sachin had to say it just once...

1239
01:40:54,599 --> 01:40:57,034
...and she would have aborted
the child without a question.

1240
01:40:59,099 --> 01:41:00,533
But, Sachin didn't do that...

1241
01:41:02,599 --> 01:41:05,535
Because,
after three years of marriage...

1242
01:41:08,566 --> 01:41:10,334
...he knew by now
that his wife Aarti...

1243
01:41:12,566 --> 01:41:15,335
...cannot give birth.
She's infertile.

1244
01:41:15,699 --> 01:41:17,033
l'm sory...

1245
01:41:20,499 --> 01:41:24,402
l confirmed this through
the gynecologists...

1246
01:41:25,132 --> 01:41:25,966
...in Ahmedabad...

1247
01:41:26,032 --> 01:41:28,067
Are you the family
physician for the Mahajans?

1248
01:41:28,299 --> 01:41:29,400
l have a few questions for you...

1249
01:41:29,466 --> 01:41:31,501
You visited these gynecologists
for treatment, didn't you?

1250
01:41:31,966 --> 01:41:35,035
All this is irrelevant!!
- Alright.

1251
01:41:35,332 --> 01:41:37,033
Coming back to the stoy...

1252
01:41:37,099 --> 01:41:40,202
Sachin then sent...

1253
01:41:41,265 --> 01:41:44,334
...Remi away to her
mother's house in Goa...

1254
01:41:46,032 --> 01:41:49,135
...where Remi gave birth to
a beautiful little baby girl...

1255
01:41:53,232 --> 01:41:54,132
...Ayesha.

1256
01:42:01,265 --> 01:42:02,399
Next, Sachin convinced Aarti...

1257
01:42:02,466 --> 01:42:06,870
...that he's adopting a
baby girl from an orphanage...

1258
01:42:07,632 --> 01:42:08,933
Aarti agreed...

1259
01:42:18,032 --> 01:42:22,870
This is Ayesha's birth certificate,
from the birth registy office...

1260
01:42:25,065 --> 01:42:26,166
lt's fake.

1261
01:42:29,866 --> 01:42:32,201
Then, when Sachin
started a clinic here...

1262
01:42:33,132 --> 01:42:35,300
...he called Remi back to Mumbai
and employed her as a nurse.

1263
01:42:35,532 --> 01:42:37,233
l am Remi.
- Come in.

1264
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:44,871
You may wonder now,
- How did Aarti not know this...?

1265
01:42:46,099 --> 01:42:52,472
l'm sure she must have suspected it...

1266
01:42:54,132 --> 01:42:57,435
But, Sachin Mahajan
was a seasoned player...

1267
01:42:59,799 --> 01:43:01,500
...he successfully convinced
Aarti othemise.

1268
01:43:02,532 --> 01:43:06,569
But then,
one day after eighteen years...

1269
01:43:07,332 --> 01:43:11,002
...Aarti finally saw
Remi and Sachin together...

1270
01:43:29,232 --> 01:43:30,800
lsn't that right, Aarti ma'am?

1271
01:43:33,399 --> 01:43:34,867
Why are you doing this?

1272
01:43:36,032 --> 01:43:37,366
Haven't we suffered enough?

1273
01:43:38,032 --> 01:43:41,135
Why are you humiliating us so?

1274
01:43:41,199 --> 01:43:42,433
Weren't you in Pune, that night?

1275
01:43:44,566 --> 01:43:45,566
What?

1276
01:43:45,966 --> 01:43:47,967
Weren't you in Pune
on the night of the murder?

1277
01:43:50,232 --> 01:43:51,366
Yes...

1278
01:43:53,032 --> 01:43:54,900
That's where l'm a bit confused.

1279
01:43:56,299 --> 01:43:58,834
The operation that
you were called for...

1280
01:43:59,966 --> 01:44:01,267
...the amputation...

1281
01:44:02,432 --> 01:44:06,402
...was over before
you reached the hospital.

1282
01:44:07,799 --> 01:44:09,167
Since it was an emergency...

1283
01:44:09,232 --> 01:44:13,002
...a junior doctor had executed
the operation, in your place.

1284
01:44:13,065 --> 01:44:15,400
Operation records from
Bhagwati Hospital, Pune...

1285
01:44:15,866 --> 01:44:17,133
...the doctor's name,

1286
01:44:18,132 --> 01:44:19,233
the time of the operation, etc...
- l reached a bit late...

1287
01:44:19,299 --> 01:44:20,433
Right.

1288
01:44:21,232 --> 01:44:22,499
And this...

1289
01:44:23,432 --> 01:44:26,034
...the taxi service...

1290
01:44:28,866 --> 01:44:31,101
...that dropped you here
at your doorstep at 11 :45 p.m.

1291
01:44:31,499 --> 01:44:33,033
You were here, weren't you?

1292
01:44:33,232 --> 01:44:35,867
You reached here
at eleven forty-five...

1293
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:48,800
How is this relevant?

1294
01:44:48,866 --> 01:44:50,200
What has it got to do with anything?

1295
01:44:52,332 --> 01:44:53,833
You tell us - how's it relevant?

1296
01:44:55,332 --> 01:44:56,399
What are you tying to say?

1297
01:44:56,666 --> 01:44:59,035
What the hell are you tying to say?

1298
01:44:59,099 --> 01:45:00,033
lf all this is not relevant...

1299
01:45:00,099 --> 01:45:01,834
...then why the hell
are you getting worked up!?

1300
01:45:04,332 --> 01:45:05,399
What?

1301
01:45:19,065 --> 01:45:21,267
No one knew that
Aarti had reached home...

1302
01:45:23,132 --> 01:45:26,401
Dr. Sachin Mahajan,
drunk to the bone...

1303
01:45:27,265 --> 01:45:30,034
...reached his
apartment at midnight...

1304
01:45:52,099 --> 01:45:53,400
And then...

1305
01:45:53,666 --> 01:45:55,300
Careful, Riyaz...please be careful...

1306
01:45:55,332 --> 01:45:58,101
Keep your calm...l'm doing it right...

1307
01:45:58,899 --> 01:46:00,767
Careful, please...

1308
01:46:03,833 --> 01:46:06,001
Riyaz, please, go now...

1309
01:46:06,099 --> 01:46:09,836
l'm going...
- Leave now, please...

1310
01:46:25,032 --> 01:46:27,601
Just leave now, please...
- l'm leaving, you take care...

1311
01:46:56,232 --> 01:46:58,901
This was the best
opportunity Aarti'd ever get...

1312
01:46:58,966 --> 01:47:01,568
...to get even with
Sachin and his family.

1313
01:47:02,699 --> 01:47:07,637
Why are we even listening
to this man's gibberish?

1314
01:47:13,632 --> 01:47:14,933
And then, Aarti...

1315
01:47:58,232 --> 01:47:59,633
Bullshit!

1316
01:48:00,532 --> 01:48:01,900
You accused Sachin earlier,

1317
01:48:02,099 --> 01:48:03,166
And now me!

1318
01:48:03,599 --> 01:48:05,801
You know what?
Just get out of my house...

1319
01:48:06,165 --> 01:48:07,065
Just get out!

1320
01:48:07,132 --> 01:48:08,666
Just get out of here...

1321
01:48:08,733 --> 01:48:10,768
Just get out of here...
- Ma'am, please calm down...

1322
01:48:10,833 --> 01:48:12,568
What the hell are you doing?
- What's he tying to do?

1323
01:48:12,632 --> 01:48:15,201
Ma'am, it's a C.B.l. inquiy...
- What are you doing?

1324
01:48:15,466 --> 01:48:16,466
Ma'am, it's a C.B.l. inquiy...

1325
01:48:16,532 --> 01:48:18,467
Please, stay calm. Ma'am, please...

1326
01:48:18,733 --> 01:48:19,934
Please, sit down...

1327
01:48:21,799 --> 01:48:26,136
Cary on your discourse,
Mr. Paraskar...

1328
01:48:27,165 --> 01:48:29,901
Actually, it slipped my mind...

1329
01:48:30,165 --> 01:48:32,534
...how would you explain
Chetan's death?

1330
01:48:32,599 --> 01:48:33,900
lnspector Malwade?

1331
01:48:34,165 --> 01:48:35,032
You've begun taking
this madman seriously?

1332
01:48:35,099 --> 01:48:38,535
When Aarti emerged from
Ayesha's room after killing her...

1333
01:48:38,733 --> 01:48:41,769
...Chetan may have stepped
out of his room too...

1334
01:48:41,799 --> 01:48:42,900
...maybe to use the loo.

1335
01:48:42,966 --> 01:48:45,535
That's when...

1336
01:48:46,065 --> 01:48:49,468
...he might have seen her.

1337
01:48:57,566 --> 01:48:59,801
Anything...just anything!

1338
01:48:59,966 --> 01:49:01,100
Anything...

1339
01:49:02,132 --> 01:49:05,702
Then, you struck a deal with Chetan.

1340
01:49:07,432 --> 01:49:08,533
Did you not strike a deal!?

1341
01:49:13,866 --> 01:49:15,400
Careful.

1342
01:49:35,032 --> 01:49:38,802
Mr. Paraskar, with all due respect
to your experience in the C.B.l...

1343
01:49:38,866 --> 01:49:40,901
...your theoy here
is completely wrong.

1344
01:49:40,966 --> 01:49:43,168
This could not have been the work
of a delicate lady.

1345
01:49:43,432 --> 01:49:44,599
lt's impossible.

1346
01:49:44,966 --> 01:49:47,001
Dr. Aarti Mahajan...

1347
01:49:47,666 --> 01:49:49,067
...is an orthopedic surgeon.

1348
01:49:51,666 --> 01:49:59,874
She amputates human
limbs - arms, legs...

1349
01:50:00,632 --> 01:50:03,167
...clean, precise...

1350
01:50:05,733 --> 01:50:07,968
...with her skilled,
trained and strong hands.

1351
01:50:08,833 --> 01:50:09,733
So?

1352
01:50:09,899 --> 01:50:10,733
Like this...

1353
01:50:10,799 --> 01:50:11,666
Hey!

1354
01:50:15,699 --> 01:50:17,000
Do not ty that again.

1355
01:50:34,599 --> 01:50:37,935
And with these strong,
trained hands...

1356
01:50:38,466 --> 01:50:42,002
...she concealed Chetan's
body below the floorboards.

1357
01:51:23,032 --> 01:51:25,934
And then, at 1 :30 a.m., when...

1358
01:51:26,499 --> 01:51:30,569
...the security guard had fallen asleep,
she silently made her exit.

1359
01:51:31,432 --> 01:51:32,800
Aarti knew...

1360
01:51:33,099 --> 01:51:35,935
...that Chetan's body
would be discovered soon...

1361
01:51:36,432 --> 01:51:37,599
...and that's exactly what she wanted.

1362
01:51:38,632 --> 01:51:40,767
So that the noose gets
tighter around Sachin's neck.

1363
01:51:42,833 --> 01:51:44,100
ln the morning...

1364
01:51:44,966 --> 01:51:46,500
...Remi saw Ayesha's body...

1365
01:51:46,566 --> 01:51:47,533
Sir...!

1366
01:51:48,099 --> 01:51:49,633
Remi woke Sachin up,

1367
01:51:50,933 --> 01:51:52,601
They wept bitterly for their child,
and then...

1368
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:54,267
...in a hasty attempt
to protect Sachin...

1369
01:51:54,332 --> 01:51:57,702
...Remi tried to dispose
his blood-stained shirt off...

1370
01:51:58,466 --> 01:51:59,567
Finally...

1371
01:52:00,766 --> 01:52:02,567
lt was time for
Aarti's final vendetta.

1372
01:52:02,799 --> 01:52:04,800
The lock of that hotel
suite was neither forced...

1373
01:52:04,866 --> 01:52:05,733
...nor damaged nor tampered with.

1374
01:52:05,799 --> 01:52:13,306
The only logical explanation,
for the killer to have got in, is...

1375
01:52:20,299 --> 01:52:24,903
...that Sachin invited
the killer in, himself.

1376
01:52:25,699 --> 01:52:28,435
You'd visited Sachin at the hotel...

1377
01:52:28,466 --> 01:52:29,834
...with the divorce papers, right?

1378
01:53:06,199 --> 01:53:09,235
Then who killed my son Riyaz!!!?

1379
01:53:11,366 --> 01:53:12,333
And, sir...

1380
01:53:12,399 --> 01:53:15,835
...who killed poor
old Sudhakar Mishra?

1381
01:53:24,499 --> 01:53:25,533
He did.

1382
01:53:27,299 --> 01:53:31,202
Aarti had bought off Malwade,
right at the beginning.

1383
01:53:47,632 --> 01:53:51,268
Riyaz contacted you, as soon
as he heard of Ayesha's death.

1384
01:53:51,466 --> 01:53:52,967
Ayesha's dad has killed her...

1385
01:53:53,866 --> 01:53:55,434
...l want to kill him,
with my own hands.

1386
01:53:56,199 --> 01:53:57,333
But, by then...

1387
01:53:57,599 --> 01:54:00,268
...Mr. Malwade had been bought over...

1388
01:54:00,466 --> 01:54:02,501
There's this young guy, Riyaz.

1389
01:54:03,165 --> 01:54:05,400
He says - Sachin has killed Ayesha.

1390
01:54:06,299 --> 01:54:09,402
He wants to kill Sachin
with his own hands.

1391
01:54:09,799 --> 01:54:10,900
What do we do with him?

1392
01:54:11,165 --> 01:54:12,699
Control him for now.

1393
01:54:14,232 --> 01:54:15,766
Tell him that this
is not the right time.

1394
01:54:16,899 --> 01:54:19,501
lf the law does not convict Sachin...

1395
01:54:20,799 --> 01:54:22,333
...then we'll use this boy.

1396
01:54:22,599 --> 01:54:24,634
lf the law failed to punish Sachin...

1397
01:54:25,899 --> 01:54:28,434
...Aarti would've used
Riyaz to punish him.

1398
01:54:28,499 --> 01:54:31,902
You were present at the scene
of crime at the time of the murder.

1399
01:54:32,165 --> 01:54:33,733
And there's a deep gash on your arm.

1400
01:54:33,799 --> 01:54:37,569
The defense lamer could
put the blame of the murder on you.

1401
01:54:37,699 --> 01:54:39,901
lt's best that you go
underground for some time now.

1402
01:54:40,165 --> 01:54:43,134
lf Sachin is convicted, then you
can come forth and give a statement.

1403
01:54:43,366 --> 01:54:45,601
lf he gets out on bail,
you can kill him.

1404
01:54:45,866 --> 01:54:49,636
Malwade then pressurized
Sudhakar Mishra...

1405
01:54:50,165 --> 01:54:52,133
...into delivering food to Riyaz.

1406
01:54:52,199 --> 01:54:53,700
Do you wish to come
clean from this case?

1407
01:54:53,766 --> 01:54:57,202
Yes sir, please.
- Then do as l say.

1408
01:54:58,199 --> 01:55:03,170
One day, Malwade visited
Kanheri caves to check on Riyaz.

1409
01:55:05,399 --> 01:55:06,666
But instead, he saw that...

1410
01:55:06,733 --> 01:55:10,403
...Parvez and l had tracked down this
hideout by trailing Sudhakar Mishra.

1411
01:55:11,499 --> 01:55:13,067
So, he attacked me...

1412
01:55:16,699 --> 01:55:18,834
Since we'd seen Sudhakar
Mishra coming there...

1413
01:55:20,232 --> 01:55:22,534
...you killed him off too.

1414
01:55:25,799 --> 01:55:27,734
You picked up the tiffin
box from the tracks...

1415
01:55:29,499 --> 01:55:32,134
...since it had Riyaz's fingerprints.

1416
01:55:34,099 --> 01:55:37,735
l still managed to deduce that
it was Riyaz holed up at the caves.

1417
01:55:38,332 --> 01:55:39,833
lt's beef, sir.

1418
01:55:40,432 --> 01:55:43,301
Had Riyaz opened
his mouth to the C.B.l...

1419
01:55:43,366 --> 01:55:45,634
Tell me! What happened
in the apartment that night!?

1420
01:55:46,099 --> 01:55:54,207
...yOUr 9ame WaS Up, SO yOU...

1421
01:56:11,366 --> 01:56:14,135
Mr. Malwade, thanks for...

1422
01:56:15,265 --> 01:56:18,267
You bastard! You killed my only son!

1423
01:56:18,332 --> 01:56:21,134
l won't spare you!
l'll buy you with your uniform...

1424
01:56:21,199 --> 01:56:24,068
l'll finish you and your family!

1425
01:56:24,132 --> 01:56:26,067
Let go of me! Let me at him!

1426
01:56:26,132 --> 01:56:29,335
Get lost...

1427
01:56:29,699 --> 01:56:32,601
You have no evidence,
Mr. Paraskar.

1428
01:56:38,432 --> 01:56:41,768
You have no evidence.

1429
01:56:42,032 --> 01:56:46,035
You are my evidence.

1430
01:56:47,666 --> 01:56:50,001
Take him away!

1431
01:56:50,532 --> 01:56:52,033
Hey, take him away!

1432
01:56:52,099 --> 01:56:55,268
Yes sir.
Come on, get him.

1433
01:56:56,165 --> 01:56:59,234
You can't touch an officer in uniform!

1434
01:56:59,299 --> 01:57:02,035
Come on, move!

1435
01:57:02,265 --> 01:57:04,133
l'll fix you guys...

1436
01:57:09,165 --> 01:57:13,068
l found an old photograph
of Remi at her mother's place.

1437
01:57:14,032 --> 01:57:23,641
ln an 18-year old Remi's face,
l saw an 18-year old Ayesha.

1438
01:57:25,466 --> 01:57:31,438
And that's when all the little
pieces of this mystey fell in place.
