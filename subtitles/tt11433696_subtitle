1
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,320
Generations are changing.

2
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,720
Girl Child is scaling heights.

3
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,720
From cooking in the kitchen...

4
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,240
to getting worldwide
honor, she is grown so much.

5
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,680
But when faced with the
claws of a a few cruel men.

6
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,520
She often becomes the victim.

7
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,840
So, let's save Girl Child
and save womanhood.

8
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:41,840
Remember.

9
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,320
Their safety is our responsibility.

10
00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:11,080
We want...
Justice!

11
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:47,480
We want...
Justice!

12
00:02:47,480 --> 00:03:01,200
We want...
Justice!

13
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,200
Who is this guy?

14
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,600
What did he even do?

15
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,920
Why are they burning his cutouts
by spending so much money?

16
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,080
Do not strain your brain
with this confusion.

17
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,280
You should get to know my
story if you want to know me.

18
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,280
Come with me.

19
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,840
Virat is coming! Virat is coming!

20
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,240
Virat is coming! Virat is coming!

21
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,560
Virat! Virat! Virat!

22
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,800
Anger, Affection, Sorrow, Joy,
Happiness and Sadness...

23
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:18,440
These are all emotions that
change with time and reason.

24
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,960
Similarly, love is also an emotion.

25
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,800
What is the guarantee that it will not change?

26
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,520
No. No. No. No.

27
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:32,880
I do not ask for my moms permission
to do anything or go anywhere.

28
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:37,920
But when in a committed relationship,
you are expected to do that.

29
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,920
What the hell, guys! I mean, seriously?

30
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,960
I bloody condemn it.

31
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,280
I condemn it. We all condemn it.

32
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:47,160
Looking at you guys, I remember a saying.

33
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,560
It goes, Behind every successful man,
there is a woman.

34
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,720
Girls, it is definitely true
when you reverse the roles.

35
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,080
Likewise, for every unsuccessful man,
there is a woman behind him.

36
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,080
The point to be noted is.

37
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,240
There are more unsuccessful men
in our country than successful ones.

38
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,080
Yes! Yes!

39
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,800
Our Constitution gave us
fundamental rights to live freely.

40
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:13,240
But we're ruining them in the
name of committed relationships.

41
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,680
We are losing our damn right.

42
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,720
Yes! Yes! Yes!

43
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:19,200
When you get into a
committed relationship.

44
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:22,160
It is a one-way ticket for them to hurt you.
It is a fact.

45
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,360
You must be thinking.

46
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,200
I have a sad love story.
I must’ve had a bad break up.

47
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,440
But, that is not the case.
My dear brothers and sisters.

48
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,480
It is the teachings of these legends.

49
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,800
If you still do not get why
I am against relationships.

50
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:40,880
I have compiled 108 of my
best learnings into this book.

51
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,800
This is not just a book. My dear
brothers and sisters, this is our life.

52
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,400
What’s our goal?

53
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:51,600
No love! No love!

54
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,960
What is our agenda?

55
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,720
Freedom! Freedom!

56
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,760
Finally, what is our slogan?

57
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:02,800
Solo life is so better!
Solo life is so better!

58
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,920
Everybody, listen up!

59
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,120
Just be solo.

60
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,160
Say it again.

61
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,640
Solo life is so better.

62
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,840
Everybody, listen up!

63
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,240
Just be solo.

64
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,480
Say it again.

65
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,800
Solo life is so better.

66
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,400
Say it aloud, bachelor.

67
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,240
Solo life is so better.

68
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,400
Do not get tangled in this drama

69
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,640
No one can get you out of it

70
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:04,800
You will keep drowning, dear.

71
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,560
Love is a path filled with thorns.

72
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,400
Why do not you trust me!

73
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,800
Do not just walk blindly,

74
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,360
It is so dangerous.

75
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,720
Say it aloud bachelor.

76
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,440
Solo life is so better.

77
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,840
Say it aloud bachelor.

78
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,640
Solo life is so better.

79
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:37,120
We are all on a spiritual path.

80
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,800
These relations will not fetch us anything.

81
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:46,280
All the elderly people
know this harsh truth

82
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:50,720
But they keep lying to us.

83
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,400
Solo life is so better.

84
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,920
Listen to me bachelor.

85
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:02,240
Say it aloud bachelor.

86
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,760
Solo life is so better.

87
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,480
Say it aloud bachelor.

88
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,960
Solo life is so better.

89
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,480
Boys and Girls.

90
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,640
Everybody listen.

91
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,920
Just be solo.

92
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,120
Say it again.

93
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,560
Solo life is so better.

94
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,720
Everybody listen.

95
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,040
Just be solo.

96
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,280
Say it again.

97
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,800
Solo life is so better.

98
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,960
What is this, dear?
You have bought all rotten vegetables.

99
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,520
You should have double checked, right?

100
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,000
How do you expect me to cook these?

101
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:55,360
And, how many times do I have to tell you?

102
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,400
And, how many times do I have to tell you?

103
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:01,520
Mom, you could have left the world smoothly.

104
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:04,120
But you had to rip me of my
sanity by marrying me to her.

105
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:08,000
You are happy, right?
You must be having fun up there.

106
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:13,480
Uncle, I have motivated the youth
greatly with your inspiration.

107
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,560
You are amazing, man.

108
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:18,480
You cannot handle things at home.

109
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,040
But you are giving out crappy advice.

110
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,920
What? She is still home?
Did not she go out?

111
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,120
At least you get some
sense into your brain.

112
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,600
Because I have been a
fool, I am cautioning him.

113
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,000
Well, this is an everyday scene.

114
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,120
By the way, are they here?
Yes, uncle.

115
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:31,960
Let us go.

116
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,600
I insisted that he does not marry.
But he did not give a damn.

117
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,000
He was so cool back then.
Young and charming.

118
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,720
Ever since he got married,
he’s become stagnant.

119
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,240
Uncle, what about Rajesh?

120
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,480
Rajesh lived like a King.

121
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,840
He gave up, you know.

122
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,080
I mean, he got married
and lost all his confidence.

123
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:53,920
Destroyed! He did not listen
to anybody. Got depressed.

124
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,240
Hey. Why did not you tell me?

125
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,200
Why did not you look?

126
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,600
What the hell!

127
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:02,240
You know that is not happening.

128
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,160
We should definitely capture this moment.

129
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:08,400
We should definitely capture this moment.

130
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:12,600
He thinks he is a pro cinematographer.
Half his pictures are out of focus.

131
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:15,080
He is the reason my passport
application got rejected.

132
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,080
Today is the last day, bro.
I will never drink again.

133
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,840
Hey! What is this?

134
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,560
Please. Please.
It comes only once a year. Please.

135
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,040
Okay. Go ahead.

136
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,120
Happy birthday!

137
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:56,640
Hello.

138
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,800
Happy birthday, Love.

139
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,680
Thanks, Mom.

140
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,640
Dad wants to talk.

141
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,560
Talk to you later, mom. Bye.

142
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,640
Virat Happy birthday!

143
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,360
Why did you cut my call
when I was wishing you?

144
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,920
According to poem no. 36, we should
keep our family emotions under control.

145
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,160
Otherwise, we will see a downfall in life.

146
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,120
The last 4 years have been amazing, huh?

147
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,240
Everything from the past seems amazing.

148
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,080
You are coming to the
farewell tomorrow, right?

149
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,760
Definitely.
Thanks to my fellow students and faculty.

150
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,320
I am just leaving the college.

151
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,800
Our ideology is going to remain the same.

152
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:45,080
If so I get married in the future.

153
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,560
That is the day we have truly parted ways.

154
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,360
Solo life is
So better!

155
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,720
That is good.

156
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,280
What is next for you, bro?

157
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,480
Why do you want to know?

158
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,320
Why? What are you going to do, bro?

159
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,200
When Dharma Raju goes to the jungle?
Pandavas do not go to Australia, do they?

160
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,160
We will go wherever he goes.

161
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,040
Virat
Hmm?

162
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,800
I need to talk to you.

163
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:07,520
Tell me.

164
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:12,280
Not here. It needs to be in private.

165
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,720
Do not stretch it. Come to the point.

166
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,600
I have a party to attend.

167
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,200
I have a party to attend.

168
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,760
Umm. I love you.

169
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,440
Are you out of your mind?

170
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,880
What did you just say?
What the hell is wrong with you?

171
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:28,160
I have known you all these years.

172
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,760
Your company, your style, the way you talk.

173
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:33,360
I really like you.

174
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,800
That is why I feel like I want you,
all to myself.

175
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,680
Just because the ventilation is good.

176
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,480
you do not claim a rented
house as your own, do you?

177
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,160
Same theory applies to me as well.

178
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,520
I am not going to say I will think about it.

179
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,280
It is all crap, okay?

180
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,360
But I have a good offer for you.

181
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,120
Because you say you are hot for me.

182
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,800
I mean, in your words, love.

183
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,920
I will give you the directions
to my friends place.

184
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,120
Let us create good memories tonight.

185
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:06,880
Let us go?

186
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:08,520
What do you say?

187
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,640
I said I love you and you rejected me.

188
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:17,440
In the future, in case you do not
find love when you most need it.

189
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,640
That is when you will realize my pain.

190
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,520
Happy farewell, darling!

191
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:33,240
Bro, she is Miss Vizag.

192
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,560
10 guys have been after
her from our college itself.

193
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,560
She proposed so cutely
and you still rejected her?

194
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:47,760
Listen. Sometimes, God tests us
to see if we will stick to our principles.

195
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,200
Come on. Let us celebrate.

196
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,440
Hey! You better do not bring
that camera to Hyderabad.

197
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,160
What are these for? Remove them.

198
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:57,680
Hey!

199
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:03,360
Hey! You are never home
when you are here in Vizag.

200
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,680
Now you are going all the way to Hyderabad.

201
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,080
Stay in touch on phone, okay?

202
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,640
Mom, no lectures before leaving.

203
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,440
Shall I drop you at the station?

204
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,720
No need. My friends are coming.

205
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,000
Let me know if you need money.

206
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:17,200
No, thanks.
I got a job in an event management company.

207
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,160
He did not tell me either.

208
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:23,800
Really? Why did not you tell me?

209
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:24,960
What is there to tell?

210
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,960
So, you are going to
remain solo even there?

211
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,520
Mom, I am running late.
I have to meet Venu uncle on the way. Bye.

212
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,400
Bye.

213
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,600
Murali, did you guys start?

214
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,120
Yeah.

215
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,640
Uncle Uncle
Hmm?

216
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,560
I am leaving.

217
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,680
What? You are leaving today?
Hmm.

218
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,120
Did you plan everything?

219
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,200
All set, uncle.

220
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,240
I will work in an event management
company for a few years.

221
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,040
Start my own company soon.

222
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,720
And enjoy the rest of my solo life.

223
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,080
You are just amazing!

224
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,640
Want to have some coffee?

225
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,440
No, auntie.

226
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,600
Ask him to take his pill after coffee.

227
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,080
We do not want his blood
pressure rising again.

228
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:15,440
When did it rise by the way?

229
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,160
We had a huge fight because
I came home drunk last night.

230
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,280
You know that Smoking and Drinking is
injurious to health disclaimer before a movie.

231
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,840
You know that Smoking and Drinking is
injurious to health disclaimer before a movie.

232
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:27,440
Someone should pass a disclaimer saying
Marriage and wives are injurious to health.

233
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:31,440
Sounds nice, uncle. I will put it in my book.

234
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,200
Go ahead.

235
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,320
One more thing. My
friend Mohan lives there.

236
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,320
You can go to him in case you
need anything. He will help you out.

237
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:38,960
Hmm.

238
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:42,280
Hyderabad! What a city!

239
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,160
Hey, Sandeep.
Put the camera aside and move that couch.

240
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
No one comes near the kitchen, okay?

241
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,280
No one will even try, bro.
You are our official cook.

242
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,640
Why did you put the bag on crockery?

243
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,320
Hey! Decrease the volume.

244
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,480
Where is the Vajpayee photograph?

245
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,560
It should be there. Check.

246
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:11,560
Look where the fridge is.
What is with you guys?

247
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,640
Hold on a minute.
I will set up everything and then arrange it.

248
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,200
How can I do everything by myself, bro?

249
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,560
Hey, you are from Vizag, right?

250
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,120
Yes. How do you know?

251
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:21,520
It is the way you end
every sentence with a bro.

252
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,800
Good observation. Did you
settle in? I am from near Anakapalli.

253
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,280
Oh.

254
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,640
Can you cook?

255
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,160
No.

256
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,480
Find me if you need anything.
I live one floor under you.

257
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,840
He does not let me talk.

258
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:31,800
And this is my husband.

259
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,800
Hello. If you want anything, please ask me.

260
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:34,560
Okay. Okay.

261
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:37,040
Do not feel shy. We
belong to the same place.

262
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,640
We must help each other out.

263
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,960
We will come find you in
case we need anything.

264
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,360
Let me arrange it. I can do it.
-It is okay. Please go.

265
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,520
Do not come through the window again.
-Okay. Let me know if you need anything.

266
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,600
Bro, we are making chicken fry tonight.

267
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,560
Do not strain yourself.

268
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:45,480
Hi, guys. My name is Virat. I am from Vizag.

269
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,520
Did you have to make such
a loud sound to say that?

270
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,320
The sound was not about introducing myself.

271
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,520
It is about something else.

272
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,520
What is it, bro?

273
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:58,040
I do not like the way you guys work.

274
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,440
Is it so? Tell us how to work then.

275
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:04,760
I am not going to pass
statements like Work is Worship.

276
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,840
You should love what you are doing.

277
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,440
Or just go home.

278
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,560
Finally, my point is,
we should enjoy our work.

279
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,080
Not let it burden us.

280
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,160
So, what I am trying to
say is, romance your job.

281
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,520
Whoa! Well said, bro.
Come on. Clap for him, guys.

282
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,800
Hey! Do not!

283
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,800
What were you lecturing about?

284
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,280
How to romance work, maam.

285
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,800
Over smart, huh

286
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,760
Thank you, maam.

287
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,600
Welcome to the company.

288
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,400
I do not belong to anyone.

289
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,720
I have a world of my own.

290
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,040
And that’s my music.

291
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,080
Bro, you did not hit nails
into the walls, did you?

292
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,720
Someones doing it. Is it your dad?

293
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,800
Vajpayee? Abdul Kalam?

294
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,080
Hello, bro. Who are you?

295
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,440
I am the owners ma.

296
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,640
I know you are a man.
Who said any different?

297
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,280
Hey! I was going to
say I am the owners son.

298
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,200
Uff!

299
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,640
My name is Govinda Gouda.

300
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:21,000
Bro, you need to pay the rent on time.

301
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,840
I mean, we have got EMIs to pay.

302
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,560
Your maam told us everything.

303
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,920
Of course, she did.

304
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:33,440
One more thing.
You should definitely attend my wedding.

305
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,280
Why did you all turn around at
once like a gang of psycho killers?

306
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,280
He is the only guy out of sync.

307
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,640
I was just kidding.

308
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,480
You have got owls eyes.

309
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,560
Just for fun.

310
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,000
I need to talk to you, bro.

311
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,320
Come to the point.

312
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:01,880
Why, bro?

313
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,080
What do you mean?

314
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:03,720
Marriage!

315
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,520
Marriage. It is a good thing, bro.

316
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,520
Really fun!

317
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:14,000
We are partying with
colleagues in the evening.

318
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:14,960
You drink, right?

319
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,480
Bro, I am a pro.

320
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,400
When you are through with your second
peg and your wife calls to keep tabs.

321
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,720
You will definitely get frustrated
and I guarantee you that.

322
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,880
Would it still it be fun then?

323
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,680
Why would I be frustrated, bro?
Would not I be happy?

324
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:30,160
And I would not be with
colleagues at this time anyway.

325
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:34,960
If I go home, that is where the real fun is.

326
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,120
Why does not he get it?

327
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,440
Let me put this out loud and clear.

328
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,840
He who gets fooled on April 1st,
despite knowing it’s Fool’s Day.

329
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,840
And he who gets married, despite
knowing that he had be fooled every day.

330
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,040
They had never find happiness in their life.

331
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:53,240
You guys passed out in 2012.

332
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,120
But I passed out in 2002.

333
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,920
Awarded Best Employee for 10 years.

334
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,840
Let me also put this out loud and clear.

335
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:14,560
It is pretty hard to stop a hunter
on his chase and a player in form.

336
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:21,440
Just as hard it is to stop a young
lad like me from getting married.

337
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:25,120
Like really, really, really hard!

338
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,000
Got it?

339
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,160
Hey, psycho killers gang!

340
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,080
Attend the wedding if you wish.

341
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,720
If you do not, just have the food and leave.

342
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,520
As you wish.

343
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,560
It’s my wedding. My wish.

344
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,040
Govind Gouda!

345
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:43,440
In Gods name!

346
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,600
Bro, we are anyway.
Let us eat something and go.

347
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,000
Items are really delicious.
Want to have dessert?

348
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,600
You hog!
-Sure.

349
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:56,120
Hey! Who is that having
dinner without permission?

350
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,440
It is 300 rupees per plate.

351
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,560
Hey! It is the psycho killers gang.

352
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,040
I invited you guys as a formality.

353
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,440
You really showed up!

354
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:07,280
You guys are eating first anyway.
Do not spread hate talk, okay?

355
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:10,840
Meghana, please do it as I say.
Do not ask me so many questions, man.

356
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,080
Why is he acting all fancy?

357
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,040
Work from home, is it?

358
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,560
He is your event organizer.

359
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,840
Your first event!

360
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,080
Fashion show?
No.

361
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,240
Music concert?
No.

362
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,520
Marriage event.

363
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:28,840
I will not do it, maam.

364
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,240
You have to do it!

365
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,000
We had an agreement.

366
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,120
Okay, maam.

367
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,200
This must be the twist of the century.

368
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:41,800
You lectured me about how marriage sucks.

369
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:45,440
Now you have more stuff
to do here than the priest.

370
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,240
Now you have more stuff
to do here than the priest.

371
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,960
You get it?

372
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:51,680
We need someone to
help you ruin your life, right?

373
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,880
What did he just say?

374
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,480
He told you about the future.
But the present is more important to me.

375
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:00,000
Hey, cameraman! Why are you
focusing on the bride-grooms friend?

376
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:00,400
Hey, cameraman! Why are you
focusing on the bride-grooms friend?

377
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,400
The groom is here.

378
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,080
Do not make me knock you down.
Who hired this idiot?

379
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,520
Do not spread hate talk after eating, okay?
Get lost!

380
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,280
Speed up the flower decoration.

381
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,040
Quick. Quick.
We are running late.

382
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,040
I feel sorry for you.

383
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:25,080
I would not wish this upon your worst enemy.

384
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,520
Tough task, man.

385
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:30,360
Like really, really, really tough.

386
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,640
Govind Govind
Yes, dad?

387
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:33,960
Wedding has been called off.

388
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:34,960
What? Wedding has been called off?

389
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:38,040
Dad, stop joking at this point in time.
I do not like it.

390
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,760
I am not joking, son.
The wedding has been called off for real.

391
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:41,600
Why?

392
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,560
They were the ones to call it off.

393
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,680
You can not find a better way out,
I am telling you.

394
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,280
Govind, let us not fight.

395
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,760
Wedding has been called off. Be happy.

396
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,080
No, this is not done.
It is just a strategic timeout.

397
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,240
I will convince them.

398
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,240
Hey, I heard you called off the wedding.

399
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,520
You think this is a joke?

400
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,400
By the way, where’s the bride, bro?

401
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,120
She is blushing. Maybe it is her.

402
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,440
You fool! Look here.

403
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,520
You told me she looks smoking hot.

404
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,360
That is what is making me upset.

405
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,920
Girls look horrible without makeup.

406
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,320
It is a fact.

407
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,640
But this girl looks
horrible even with makeup.

408
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,680
Imagine my wrath.

409
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,680
Look at her!

410
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,760
I offered to give her a new
life because I have a big heart.

411
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,720
But she says she does not like me.

412
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,800
Hey, you! What is the problem?
Bro.

413
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,920
What is the problem?

414
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,520
Hey! Careful.

415
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,560
What did you say your
age was when we first met?

416
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:44,080
Some digit between 25-30.

417
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,680
Do not give me the age on
your 10th grade certificate.

418
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,120
I want to know the original date.

419
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:51,360
38 running. 37 years passed.

420
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:57,000
A 37 year old guy like you wants to
marry a 23 year old beautiful girl like me?

421
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,320
Did you seriously call yourself beautiful?

422
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,360
Hey, you!

423
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,800
Uncle, forgive me.

424
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,880
You fooled us about your age to
marry my little girl. How dare you!

425
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,640
Uncle, cool down.

426
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,480
Age gap is quite common.

427
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:13,920
Sachin and his wife were born
5 years apart, you know that?

428
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,560
5 years?
They have 2 kids.

429
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,400
Really?

430
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,560
Govind, I have a small doubt.

431
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,320
5 years gap can be overlooked.

432
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,640
But this seems like a generation gap.

433
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,080
I will look after her like a father would.

434
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:23,680
Who the hell am I then?

435
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,040
You are the step-father.
Get out of my sight.

436
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:27,080
I am trying to convince them, right?

437
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,040
Go look after the event.

438
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,880
Uncle, what is your problem?

439
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:30,960
You are the problem.

440
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:31,960
Come on! I am 6 feet tall.

441
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:34,280
I got it. You go. I will talk.

442
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,880
What are you saying now?

443
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,560
Wedding is cancelled.
Hold on a minute.

444
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,440
You do not have to do it.

445
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,560
We are only calling off the wedding.

446
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,120
Who the hell said that?

447
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,840
Who the heck are you?
She is my girl.

448
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:48,640
Wedding is cancelled. Get out of here.

449
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:55,400
Govind, I would not wish
this upon my worst enemy.

450
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:58,480
It is like really, really, really bad.

451
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,560
Thanks for telling us about his age.

452
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,560
Whatever.

453
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,040
You fool! What did you tell him?

454
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,640
You fool! What did you tell him?

455
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,080
Admit it. Govind is a lucky fellow.

456
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,400
You know what I think?

457
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,280
That girl is the lucky one.

458
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,120
Why?

459
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:08,840
Do not you see it?

460
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,480
He passed out in 2002.

461
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,640
Been the Best Employee for 10 years.

462
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,400
Owns a lavish apartment.
And is a single child.

463
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,400
Do not call her lucky.

464
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,600
I elevated his character by mentioning
the 10 years Best Employee thing.

465
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,320
It is not elevation. It is a revelation.

466
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:22,440
I should not have shared my
background story with you guys.

467
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,880
I should just hit myself with a sandal.

468
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:24,960
Shoe would be better, bro.

469
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,200
He is also throwing punch lines at me.

470
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,680
Yellappa, get me drinks, please.

471
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,640
It is okay if there is no water.

472
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,160
I will just fetch some from the
swimming pool and crash.

473
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,280
I will just fetch some from the
swimming pool and crash.

474
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:34,560
Govind, why are you so worked up?

475
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:34,840
You gave her the consent
to hurt you for a lifetime.

476
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:37,360
You gave her the consent
to hurt you for a lifetime.

477
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,600
What did she do?

478
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,400
She hurt you for a day and left you.

479
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,280
You should be happy.

480
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,920
Bro, that is one torturous philosophy.
I do not get it.

481
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:58,720
Say no to marriage

482
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,320
Do not commit this mistake

483
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,040
Say no to marriage

484
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:07,320
Do not commit this mistake

485
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,120
You cannot bear the torture after marriage

486
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,880
Great poet Vamana has already said this

487
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,880
I wish this punishment is not
imposed on my enemies also

488
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,520
I wish this punishment is not
imposed on my enemies also

489
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,120
Marriage is torture

490
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:22,160
Marriage is a heavy baggage
which you can not carry, my brother.

491
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,640
Marriage is a heavy baggage
which you can not carry, my brother.

492
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:28,280
This is a big ocean and you will drown in it.

493
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:31,560
Marriage is all the following.
Torture, Fracture, Puncture, Rupture

494
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,120
Be careful, my brother.

495
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,240
Say no to marriage

496
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,840
Do not commit this mistake

497
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,520
Say no to marriage

498
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,880
Do not commit this mistake

499
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:51,280
Bro, it is my sisters birthday.

500
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,400
Bro, it is my sisters birthday.

501
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:53,360
Get lost!

502
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,360
You can not bear the torture after marriage

503
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:01,000
Great poet Vamana has already said this

504
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,200
I wish this punishment is not
imposed on my enemies also

505
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,640
I wish this punishment is not
imposed on my enemies also

506
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:06,000
Marriage is torture

507
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,560
Why do you say no to marriage?

508
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:43,840
You Got to Make It Work And See It Shine,

509
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:48,640
Life looks colourful if a girl is with you?

510
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,280
It is so cheerful

511
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:57,000
All your freedom will be lost

512
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,880
Your kingdom will collapse

513
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:02,320
Why should your life stop at a dead end?

514
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:05,320
All the life lies in the weekend

515
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:10,720
Do not disturb your space, pace and peace.

516
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:15,520
Do not run towards the oasis in the desert

517
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:18,600
Marriage is as poisonous as a snake,
and you can not win this game.

518
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,360
Be careful, my dear brother.

519
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,360
Say no to marriage

520
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,960
Do not commit this mistake

521
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,680
Say no to marriage

522
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,920
Do not commit this mistake

523
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,920
Happy Good boy!

524
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:56,880
What is up, Murali? Why are you pacing?

525
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:00,320
Bro, I need to talk to you.

526
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:01,160
Tell me.

527
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:04,720
The thing is.

528
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:06,440
Come to the point already.

529
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,720
My family fixed my marriage.

530
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,200
Tell them you are not interested.

531
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:19,160
Grandma is in a critical condition.

532
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,280
She wants to witness my
wedding before she passes.

533
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:25,200
So, my family is pressurizing
me to get married.

534
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:26,560
What the hell!

535
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,120
We wanted to spend the rest of
our lives without any inhibitions.

536
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,320
Why are you doing this now?

537
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:36,280
You cannot get married just because
your grandmas health is worsening.

538
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:44,160
To be honest, I also
want to get married, dude.

539
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,160
We can not be solo for life, right?

540
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,640
Bro Bro.

541
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,920
What? You want to get married?

542
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:59,360
And you are making excuses that
someone in your familys dying.

543
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:02,600
You said you had follow me wherever I go.
All the way to Australia even.

544
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:03,800
You were messing with me, huh?

545
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,560
Come on. Come on.

546
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:06,840
Bugger off!

547
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,960
Bro, hear me out.

548
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:21,800
You are a cheater.

549
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:24,160
Get lost, you idiot!

550
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,320
Happy! Good boy.

551
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:00,280
Hey, Smart Chef! Why are you pacing?

552
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,760
Are you also getting married?

553
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,120
Yes, dude. You guessed it right.

554
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,200
I will knock you down, idiot!

555
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,520
Are you guys possessed or something?

556
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:09,000
Each one of you is getting married.

557
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:10,800
Just kidding, bro.

558
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,520
Hey! Where are you going?

559
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:13,840
Want me to send packing?

560
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:16,320
I was just kidding. Just for fun.

561
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,600
You were kidding, huh? Just for fun?

562
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:22,520
What? Did someone bring up marriage?

563
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,320
Hell, no!

564
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,280
Sure?
Yeah.

565
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:27,280
How long since you read the book?

566
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,600
It is been 5 years, bro.
-So long, huh?

567
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,200
Mug it up tonight and
recite it to me tomorrow.

568
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:32,880
Okay?

569
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,320
Good night, bro.

570
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,000
Ah!

571
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:40,440
What about you?

572
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,080
Do you also plan on getting married?

573
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,360
I just read the book, bro.

574
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,320
Very good.

575
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,680
Pour the beer.
Okay.

576
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:52,280
Hey, Chaitu! Did you read the book?

577
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:57,080
Did you mug up all the poems?

578
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:00,120
If you say the word
‘Marriage one more time.

579
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:06,800
He also left?

580
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,600
He did.

581
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,920
What? Did he leave?

582
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,800
His clothes aren’t here.

583
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,000
I am sure he left through the window.

584
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,440
Oh, really? I didn’t know.

585
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:27,720
Hey! If you have any such ideas,
warn me in advance.

586
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:28,640
I will prepare myself.

587
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,760
You think I am like those idiots?

588
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,440
Do not have any doubts about me.

589
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,640
I told you I will be with you forever.

590
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:35,800
Come. Let us go.

591
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,680
He is not going.

592
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:49,440
Sandeep Sandeep

593
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:01,920
Sorry, bro. My marriage is also fixed.

594
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:13,680
I should have known when
you said you are not like them.

595
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:14,800
At least they gave me a heads up.

596
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,520
You did not even do that.
You are a cheater!

597
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:20,840
I thought only love and
marriage could hurt us.

598
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:23,240
You guys have taught me
that friends are no exception.

599
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:26,360
I am the Founder of the
Union Solo Life Is So Better.

600
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,320
I do not need any of you.

601
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,000
Challenge!

602
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:33,800
Uncle.

603
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:34,440
What is up?

604
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,960
The three other guys
who were with me, just left.

605
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,120
Did they leave?

606
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,040
Of course, they did.

607
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:39,560
Of course, they did.

608
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:42,080
I have always been skeptical about Murali.

609
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,080
He was the first one to leave.

610
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,040
Dear !

611
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:45,640
What?

612
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,800
You promised to take me to
the hospital today. Remember?

613
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:50,440
I will. I am on the phone with Virat.

614
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,400
Whoa!

615
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:55,840
Do not worry. Karma will come full circle.

616
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,840
You are right, uncle. They will pay for this.

617
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,680
You are good, right?

618
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,560
Of course, uncle. I am doing great.

619
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:02,600
I am glad.

620
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,040
Okay, uncle. Bye.

621
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,880
Virat Solo Life Is So Better.

622
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,200
Cheers!

623
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,560
Come on. Come on. Girlfriend!

624
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,120
Hey, Happy! Happy!

625
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,760
You traitor! Come on, not you too!

626
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,280
Come on. Come on.

627
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:30,800
Hey! Get lost!

628
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,080
Look. I am going to marry you only.

629
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:04,040
I have made my decision. You should do too.

630
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,480
Call me back.

631
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:09,080
What is up, bro? I do not
see you around anymore.

632
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,440
It is your poor sight because of your age.

633
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:12,680
Whoa! Cracking jokes on me, huh?

634
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:13,560
Easy!

635
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:16,600
After your psycho killers gang left,
your energy kind of came down.

636
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,880
So did your electricity and water bill.

637
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:19,840
Like really.

638
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:20,720
Happy?

639
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,960
It is been my nature since I was a kid.

640
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:42,840
Hey! Murthy bro interview is airing.

641
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:50,320
You do not save up to buy a
house and properties anymore.

642
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:51,160
Trust me.

643
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,840
There is no almarah at
my place. So, that is that.

644
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,560
You are amazing.

645
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:59,320
Be free. Be happy. That is it.

646
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:00,400
That is it.

647
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:03,840
But, what I really believe is.

648
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,240
Everyone should get married.

649
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:12,560
Murthy bro. What are you saying?

650
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:14,880
You should get married at the supposed age.

651
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,440
Abide by the Law of Nature.

652
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,080
Law of Nature?

653
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,520
Hey! Do not say another word.

654
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,080
I now regret not getting married.

655
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:31,560
Murthy bro! Is it really you talking?

656
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:35,240
When I looked outside my window one day.

657
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,320
I noticed two birds flying.

658
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,440
Birds?

659
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:46,480
Two birds, two snakes and two pigs
are making a home for themselves.

660
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:48,080
What the hell, Murthy bro!

661
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:51,880
I am saying it as a friend
to the future generations.

662
00:39:54,360 --> 00:40:00,600
Youth of today, do not avoid
marriage to achieve your goals.

663
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:04,760
Get married at the right
time and have a bunch of kids.

664
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:14,360
Stay happy. All the best.

665
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,360
All the best?

666
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:23,400
Is marriage really important?

667
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:24,280
Damn!

668
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,320
Why did Murthy bro say that?

669
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:32,120
Usually, he would not have said that.

670
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:34,440
He must have gone wrong somewhere.

671
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:38,440
Two pigs, two wild animals and two birds.

672
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:39,600
Everything is.

673
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,560
Okay. Focus.

674
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:47,400
Okay.

675
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:51,680
Get married, brother.

676
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:52,680
Murthy bro!

677
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:53,680
Your coffee, sir.

678
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,280
Not here. No.

679
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,200
Two birds!

680
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:09,480
Two snakes!

681
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:10,880
Not again!

682
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:14,480
I have to get out of here. Right now.

683
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:15,840
Oh, my god!

684
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:19,960
Come on, Virat! Come on!

685
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:25,760
Yes! Yeah! Murali, super!

686
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:32,560
Virat, you are a single man show.
You are just amazing!

687
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:44,880
Hey Happy! Where are you?

688
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:47,000
Hey Happy! Where are you?

689
00:41:58,720 --> 00:41:59,880
How are you son?

690
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:01,360
Have it. It is a festive day.

691
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,200
Here.

692
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:03,040
No. No.

693
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,960
I am like your mother. Have it.

694
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:17,200
Ah! Water.

695
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:20,920
Hey! I will not ask for it.

696
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:40,920
Gray hair?

697
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:43,240
I have grays.

698
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,280
Uncle Uncle

699
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:46,880
Drop me at school, please.

700
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:47,640
Who is he calling?

701
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,040
I am talking to you, uncle.

702
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,520
Uncle! Please, uncle!

703
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:56,880
Uncle!
Do not call me Uncle, kid!

704
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:58,640
Uncle!

705
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:03,520
Who are you calling uncle, huh?

706
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:03,920
You.

707
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,520
Do I look like an uncle to you?
Yes.

708
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:06,640
Call me Bro.

709
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:07,360
Call me Bro.

710
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:10,320
Bro, I will never call you Uncle again.

711
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:13,760
I will crush you if you call
me Uncle again. Get out!

712
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:17,080
Uncle, my foot!

713
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:18,120
Fatty!

714
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:19,800
Bye, uncle. See you, uncle.

715
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:22,160
Mommy, uncle is beating me.
You are so done for, kid!

716
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:34,000
What is uncle doing here?

717
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:35,880
He did not even give me a call.

718
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:42,840
Uncle!

719
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:44,600
Hold on. I'm coming.

720
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:45,280
Hey!

721
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:46,400
Come. Come.

722
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,080
When did you arrive in Bangalore?

723
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:55,480
I had some work with Mohan.
So I came this morning.

724
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:58,600
You arrived this morning
and did not bother to call me.

725
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:01,040
Whoa! You have changed a lot.

726
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,360
No, I did not.

727
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:04,920
I just forgot to call.

728
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:07,160
You must have fought with aunt.

729
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:08,240
It is okay to forget.

730
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:13,080
It is been 4 months since
your aunt passed away.

731
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:20,240
Uncle!

732
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:22,640
Are you alright?

733
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,000
No, I am not.

734
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,200
When she was with me.

735
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:39,240
I took her for granted and
fought with her all the time.

736
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:42,560
I have realized her value once she was gone.

737
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:47,120
Whom do I fight with now?

738
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:51,320
There is nobody to talk to when I get home.

739
00:44:56,600 --> 00:45:01,360
I thought my mom forced her
into my life before leaving the world.

740
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:06,920
But it was only after
your aunt passed away.

741
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:11,840
That I realized my mom
made my wife take her place.

742
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:20,720
We are of the assumption that the
whole world is ours, excluding them.

743
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:24,240
But they believe that we
mean the world to them.

744
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:32,400
We are so blind to their love all the time.

745
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:41,560
Women are intelligent
beings with a good heart.

746
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:47,160
They find out what we need
and do it for us in advance.

747
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:49,920
And when they are gone.

748
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:52,320
They make us realize how much we need them.

749
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,080
It is over.

750
00:45:58,400 --> 00:45:59,400
I will leave.

751
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:00,920
It is time.

752
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:03,320
Bye.

753
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:13,560
Hey! When you said
Solo Life Is So Better.

754
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:15,800
I also encouraged you.

755
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:18,680
Sorry, man.

756
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:22,320
That is not true.

757
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:29,240
Because sometimes to wipe our tears.

758
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:33,560
Even both the hands
do not seem to be enough.

759
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:36,200
Trust me.

760
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:38,480
Think about it.

761
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:58,000
Hello, mom.

762
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:58,800
Tell me.

763
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,960
Why did not you tell me
Sudha auntie passed away?

764
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:02,960
I tried calling you many times.

765
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:04,280
But you cut my calls.

766
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:07,800
I was going to tell you later.

767
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:09,760
But Venu uncle told me not to.

768
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:12,640
He did not want to
disturb you for no reason.

769
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:15,520
Okay, mom. Bye.

770
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:45,400
Hello, bro.

771
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:46,320
Hey, Virat!

772
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:47,040
Tell me, bro.

773
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:50,120
Guys, come to my flat
this weekend urgently.

774
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:52,400
We have been waiting for your call, dude.

775
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:53,400
We will be there.

776
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:55,520
Bro
Tell me.

777
00:47:55,800 --> 00:48:00,000
Thanks for forgiving me
and making this call, man.

778
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:05,320
Happy! Go and play.

779
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:08,760
What do you guys do?

780
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:10,240
Nothing much.

781
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:12,560
I am managing our gold shop in Vizag.

782
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:14,600
My wife is managing me and our kid.

783
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:15,720
It is all good.

784
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:18,480
You know Infosys company, right?
In the next lane.

785
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:20,920
Hey! Is it the same job
your uncle offered you?

786
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:22,800
I will simplify it.

787
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:24,480
Generally, people settle
down and get married.

788
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:25,800
But this guy got married
and then settled down.

789
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:28,680
Stop it! You will get the first
prize for being a party pooper.

790
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:29,400
It is true though.

791
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:30,040
What about you?

792
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:31,520
I own a fashion studio.

793
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:33,440
He clicks pictures of hot chicks.

794
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:35,520
Man, I am a fashion photographer.

795
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:36,520
Stop it, guys!

796
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:38,200
What about your own event
management company?

797
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:41,280
It is set up.

798
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:43,520
Then why are you sounding so dull?

799
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:46,640
I met Venu uncle unexpectedly.

800
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:50,240
It is been many days since
Sudha auntie passed.

801
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:57,040
He is someone who loves me dearly. Still,
he chose not to share his pain with me.

802
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:59,440
Made me realize how far I have come from him.

803
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:04,840
My parents must have gone through
so much pain when it came to me.

804
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:06,840
I realize that now.

805
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:13,640
We are pretty strong until a certain age.

806
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:18,760
We assume that we have
a lot of time to enjoy our life.

807
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:20,480
That is what I exactly felt too.

808
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:25,320
Generally, we differentiate life as
teenage, middle age and old age.

809
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
But there is an age nobody is aware of.

810
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:31,520
It is the age where you shift from 29 to 30.

811
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:34,400
That is when you go bald,
get a tummy and gray hair.

812
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:36,920
If there are so many physical changes.

813
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:38,840
Just imagine the amount
of pressure mentally.

814
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:43,840
Our friends, who were with us till then.

815
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:45,880
They go separate ways.

816
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,920
No, bro. At that time.

817
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:50,000
Come on! I do not mean you guys.

818
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:51,800
I am just saying it casually.

819
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:59,560
The philosophy I believed
in sounds good on paper.

820
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:01,560
or to makes memes on social media.

821
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:07,120
But practically, life is a much
bigger deal than what I presumed.

822
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:15,040
So, I have decided to get married.

823
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:20,000
Whoa! We have been dying to hear that.

824
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,960
Now we need to find you a partner.

825
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,240
Leave it to us. We will get it done.

826
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:25,560
There are so many girls in our class.
One of them must be available.

827
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:30,200
Hey, Priyanka! How are you?

828
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:31,400
What is the matter?

829
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:33,840
You know Virat, right?

830
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:34,960
He is young and energetic.

831
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:37,160
He just confessed that
he wants to get married.

832
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:38,160
What do you say?

833
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:39,800
I do not want to hear a thing about him.

834
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:40,720
I will kill you!

835
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:42,840
He is the villain in my love story.

836
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:44,040
No, listen.
Where is he right now?

837
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:45,040
Share his location with me.

838
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:46,920
But I do not have Whatsapp.
Bye.

839
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:51,040
Hello, Srujana. Virat wants to get married.

840
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:51,720
What do you say?

841
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:54,000
There are already 4
guys on my waiting list.

842
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,320
If Virat is fine with it, he will be the 5th.

843
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:57,080
No, thanks.

844
00:50:57,480 --> 00:50:58,080
Uh-huh.

845
00:50:58,120 --> 00:51:00,480
Guys, why are you going
on a girl hunt for him?

846
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:02,080
Bro, do you know who is
the perfect match for you?

847
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:04,120
It is Raasi. You guys
are made for each other.

848
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:05,560
She proposed so beautifully in college.

849
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:07,000
She proposed so beautifully in college.

850
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:10,080
Because you say you are hot for me.

851
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:12,560
I mean, in your words, love.

852
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:15,320
I will give you the directions to my place.

853
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:18,440
Let us create good memories tonight.

854
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:19,840
Let us go?

855
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:25,480
If she remembers what I told her last time.

856
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:27,080
She will screw my life.
Stop it, man.

857
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:29,760
Rajnikanth also insulted Ramya
Krishna several times in Narasimha.

858
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:31,480
Still, she remained unmarried for him.

859
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:33,200
Same case with Raasi.
She would wait for you.

860
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:34,440
She would.

861
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:36,120
She must.

862
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:43,560
Okay. Find out where she lives now.

863
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:48,440
She was crazy about him back then.

864
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:49,240
She had definitely wait.

865
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:49,960
Did you find her?

866
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:50,920
Found her ID.

867
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:56,920
Dude, her status says Single.
Yes!

868
00:51:56,920 --> 00:51:58,160
She is still waiting for you, man.

869
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:00,600
Did not I say you guys
are meant for each other?

870
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:02,560
Sometimes,
we look everywhere but in our pockets.

871
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,280
She is your girl, man.

872
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:15,920
Why are you still hesitant?

873
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:17,440
I told you she had wait for you.

874
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:18,800
Come on.

875
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:22,040
Hey, leave the engine on.
We will elope with her if needed.

876
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:23,840
Come on!

877
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:28,320
You are Mr. Virat, right?
Yeah.

878
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:30,560
You are Mr. Virat, are not you?
Yes.

879
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:33,360
Sir, Mr. Virat is here!
Mr. Virat has arrived!

880
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:37,040
See? Even the house help knows you.
She is waiting for you, man.

881
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:39,000
Uncle Uncle!

882
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:44,400
Virat! What a surprise, man! Come.

883
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:46,160
I mean, great to see you!

884
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:48,160
That is good. Come in.

885
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:52,640
Love you, man.

886
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:58,680
You know what? Raasi
used to talk a lot about you.

887
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:02,640
By the way, would you
like to have tea or coffee?

888
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:06,520
No, thanks. I am good.
I had like to talk to Raasi.

889
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:08,560
Yeah, sure. Why not?

890
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:12,280
One second, love. One second.

891
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:16,080
Hey, Raasi. You have a
pleasant surprise. Talk to him.

892
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:20,360
Hey, Virat.

893
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:21,600
Damn!

894
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:23,160
Hi.

895
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:24,600
Hi, Raasi.

896
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:29,280
Nice, man. I cannot believe you visited.
I wish I was there.

897
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:31,920
So, what is up? How are you? Tell me!

898
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:34,280
Any good news?

899
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:35,600
What is happening?

900
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:36,840
Did you get married?

901
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:41,840
Oh! Sorry. I forgot.

902
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:45,960
You are Virat, the legendary leader of
the movement Solo Life Is So Better.

903
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:47,920
Why would you get married?

904
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:54,040
Actually, Raasi
My opinion on marriage has changed.

905
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:55,040
What?

906
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:56,640
Mommy
-What are you saying?

907
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,800
Be quiet.
-It is about marriage actually.

908
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:04,320
Mommy. I want to talk to my mommy.

909
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:06,240
Sir, she wants to talk
to her mother. Let her.

910
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:08,320
Actually, he is Raasi's kid.

911
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:11,400
We got her married after Engineering.

912
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:13,400
She went to UK on business last week.

913
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:30,720
He said all that crap about
Rajnikanth and Ramya Krishna.

914
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:33,320
He said something else as well.

915
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:35,680
Not looking in your pockets.
Well, pockets have holes sometimes.

916
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:37,280
I will make a hole on your face now.

917
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:39,280
Let it go, bro.
We have got a lot of options.

918
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:40,640
Just relax. We will sort it out.

919
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:44,400
Stop it. Let us go.

920
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:47,000
Here. Leave the engine on, my foot!

921
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:51,960
I better find a girl for myself instead
of depending on my silly friends.

922
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:54,240
Okay.

923
00:54:57,760 --> 00:54:58,560
Right. Sending.

924
00:54:58,560 --> 00:54:59,880
Right. Sending.

925
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:02,000
Yes!

926
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:07,040
What kind of a twist is this?

927
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:08,880
No worries. There are so many other girls.

928
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:18,120
Oh, shit! It is tough.

929
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:21,960
Hey! This one looks familiar.

930
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:39,160
Nah! She is different.

931
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:43,320
Madam.

932
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:51,280
Why is she blushing so much?

933
00:55:57,240 --> 00:55:57,960
It's done.

934
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:05,480
Damn! She is killing me with her glances.

935
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:16,920
I need to get some clarity about this.

936
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:18,720
I really need God right now.

937
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:28,000
Excuse me, maam.
-Yeah.

938
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:39,400
Madam, you.

939
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:45,000
Madam, you sent a request on
my profile in the matrimonial site.

940
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:46,200
It was by mistake, right?

941
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:51,760
[in Telugu] No, Virat.
I did it voluntarily.

942
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:53,160
She speaks Telugu?

943
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:57,400
I am learning Telugu also.

944
00:56:57,920 --> 00:56:58,680
What for?

945
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:01,000
I have recently heard that.

946
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:02,480
What did you hear?

947
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:05,600
That you changed your
opinion about marriage.

948
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:07,840
So?

949
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:11,040
My opinion about marriage has also changed.

950
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:11,720
Hmm.

951
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:15,840
Actually, I am pretty
shy to say these things.

952
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:19,200
My family will come and talk to you.

953
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:20,480
Regarding?

954
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:22,200
Our marriage.

955
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:31,000
Marriage?
Yeah.

956
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:33,000
With you?

957
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:39,320
Actually, you are supposed to
ask me to marry your daughter.

958
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:41,520
How could I marry you, madam?

959
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:43,080
What are you talking, Virat?

960
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:45,080
You are also getting gray hair.

961
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:54,800
How is my single strand of gray
hair equal to your million strands?

962
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:57,560
No, Virat. Please think about it.

963
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:59,280
How can you even ask me that?

964
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:02,400
Man! All the couples you’ve separated.

965
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:03,800
They are seeking revenge on you.

966
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:04,880
It is called karma.

967
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:05,880
You deserve this.

968
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:08,960
Madam, do not feel bad.

969
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:09,720
Please do not.

970
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:12,520
I will find a super match for you. Trust me.

971
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:15,120
Please stop getting ideas about me.

972
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:16,240
Bye, madam.

973
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:17,920
Madam, I will not forget.

974
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:20,520
I will find you a super match.

975
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:22,000
See you, maam. Bye.

976
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:23,400
Oh, my god!

977
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:26,160
Bro!

978
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:28,520
Listen up, bro!

979
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:30,040
I am getting married, yo!

980
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:31,720
You are invited, bro!

981
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:33,440
Bros come first, yo!

982
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:36,600
Hey, Govind! What’s happening?

983
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:37,840
My wedding got fixed.

984
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:39,920
Whoa! Congratulations!

985
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:40,680
So you are finally getting married.

986
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:41,400
So you are finally getting married.

987
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:44,040
Bro! You should come to the wedding.

988
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:46,720
I am not in the mood, Govind.

989
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:48,400
Why should you be in
the mood for my wedding?

990
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:50,440
Oh! Is that what you understood?

991
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:52,560
I do not have the patience, Govind.

992
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:53,720
Why do not you just go ahead with it?

993
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:56,360
Gather patience, bro.

994
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:58,040
Want to know why?

995
00:58:58,040 --> 00:59:02,000
You have seen me get rejected by a girl.

996
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:05,480
Now I want you to see me
get married to a super-hot girl.

997
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:08,200
Then I can live in peace.

998
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:09,840
Do not go about seeking
revenge at this time.

999
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:10,920
Get married happily.

1000
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:13,080
No, bro! You should come
and watch my wedding.

1001
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:16,160
I did not ask you to do any
of the work there, did I?

1002
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:17,760
I just want you to be my guest.

1003
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:18,640
And you have a problem with that also.

1004
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:21,520
You should attend my wedding. That is it.

1005
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:24,120
You know you give me a hard time.
Like really, really hard time, Govind.

1006
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:26,680
You go ahead.
I will get ready and join you.

1007
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:28,640
Listen up, bro!

1008
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:30,320
Come downstairs, yo!

1009
00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:31,680
I will wait for you, bro.

1010
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:32,960
It is my nuptial night, bro.

1011
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:34,120
I am damn happy, bro.

1012
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:35,600
Like really, really happy, bro.

1013
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:36,440
Uff!

1014
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:38,240
Come fast. We have not got much time.

1015
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:39,040
I am telling you before itself.

1016
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:41,720
You cannot criticize the food at the buffet.

1017
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:43,240
You should adjust.
And go find dad.

1018
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:44,840
He must be meeting some auntie sneakily.

1019
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:46,320
Let’s go?
Bro!

1020
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,040
What is that?

1021
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:50,880
It is the breath of a wounded lion.

1022
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:51,840
How does it sound?

1023
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:55,200
By the way, why are we taking a bus?

1024
00:59:55,240 --> 00:59:55,920
Come on, bro!

1025
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:57,720
Wedding is in a small village near Vizag.

1026
00:59:57,720 --> 01:00:00,600
Location is really, really, really grand.

1027
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:03,200
Hey! You said it like it is
Miyapur or Dilsukhnagar.

1028
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:04,880
I am not coming. You go.

1029
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:05,960
Bro!

1030
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,640
Ugh! What?

1031
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:11,320
If you do not come, you will never
get married. This is my curse.

1032
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:12,920
What the hell, man!

1033
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:15,840
I will go put clothes on. Go.
Bro.

1034
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:17,800
What now?

1035
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:18,880
Get lost!

1036
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:22,400
Come fast. Quick. Quick.

1037
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:25,320
Do not walk like you are on the ramp.

1038
01:00:25,320 --> 01:00:27,400
I might turn into a skeleton right here.
Come fast.

1039
01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:40,880
Priest, it is the Lord
Ganeshs prayer next, right?

1040
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:42,240
Lord Ganeshs prayer.

1041
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:47,000
Hello. You missed 2 chants.

1042
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,760
I have watched the movie
Srinivasa Kalyanam 3 times.

1043
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:51,600
You cannot miss the chants. Read properly.

1044
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:54,200
Stop!

1045
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:54,960
Bro!

1046
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:56,720
Hey!

1047
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:58,880
You should watch Lord Ganeshs prayer.

1048
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:00,440
That is why I invited you.

1049
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:03,640
Watch. Watch.

1050
01:01:03,640 --> 01:01:04,680
You carry on.

1051
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:06,960
Where are you from?

1052
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:07,880
Vizag, sir.

1053
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:08,920
Are you married?

1054
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:09,960
No, sir.

1055
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,440
We are looking for alliances
for my brothers daughter.

1056
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:14,840
Sir! Give me your number.

1057
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:16,400
Sure. We will talk after the wedding.
Okay.

1058
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:17,400
Bring the bride.

1059
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:19,000
Bring her quickly.

1060
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:21,160
Bro!

1061
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:24,000
Do not look there. Look here.
Watch. Watch.

1062
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:27,000
Girl is smoking hot.

1063
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:29,360
You are being such a sadist.

1064
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:43,520
I gave a missed call to your number.
-Okay.

1065
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:45,520
It is time. Tie the holy thread.

1066
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:47,160
Finally!

1067
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:48,720
Give it to me.

1068
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:51,640
Lift her braid up.

1069
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:55,840
Whoa! Bro can not see her this way.

1070
01:01:55,840 --> 01:01:57,280
I should make sure he sees it.

1071
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:05,400
I do not want this wedding.

1072
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,560
I am used to this crap.
First let me tie the holy thread.

1073
01:02:08,560 --> 01:02:09,080
Stop.

1074
01:02:09,080 --> 01:02:09,720
Come on!

1075
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:12,440
Dad, I do not want this wedding.

1076
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:13,760
What do you mean?

1077
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:15,920
I spoke to you before doing any of this.

1078
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:17,120
You cannot say that now.

1079
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:19,840
I did not have clarity till now.
But now I do.

1080
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:20,480
What is that?

1081
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:21,320
I am in love.

1082
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:29,600
You should have told us earlier.

1083
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:30,960
Is this the place and time to do it?

1084
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:32,160
I almost tied the holy thread.

1085
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:33,440
Dad, I am telling you.

1086
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:33,680
I do not want this wedding.

1087
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:34,840
I do not want this wedding.

1088
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:35,880
I am in love.

1089
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:38,160
Priest, hold this and stay here.
Wedding is not called off yet.

1090
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:40,560
You said you are in love. Who is the guy?

1091
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:43,080
Tell me! Who is the guy?

1092
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:45,240
I said, who is the guy?

1093
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:08,520
Son, the bride says she wants to marry you.

1094
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:10,160
Why would she point at me? Come on!

1095
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:11,560
Yeah. She is pointing at you.

1096
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:22,280
You should come and watch my wedding.

1097
01:03:22,280 --> 01:03:23,760
You should come and watch my wedding.

1098
01:03:26,080 --> 01:03:28,040
I will not marry anybody but him.

1099
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:04,040
What is this, Amrutha?

1100
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:05,440
Dad, I already told you.

1101
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:07,040
I am not marrying anybody except him.

1102
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:08,000
No, listen.

1103
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:09,960
Mom, you do not interfere.
You do not know anything about this.

1104
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:11,160
That is final, dad.

1105
01:04:14,360 --> 01:04:16,640
I need to tell you something, man.

1106
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:19,200
Govinds wedding got cancelled.

1107
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:21,600
The bride chose me.

1108
01:04:22,560 --> 01:04:25,280
She looked at me and said
she will not marry anybody else.

1109
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:27,200
I swear, man.

1110
01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:29,040
You should have been there.

1111
01:04:29,080 --> 01:04:30,040
Call him back.

1112
01:04:31,080 --> 01:04:32,360
What have you done, bro?

1113
01:04:32,360 --> 01:04:33,280
What did I do, bro?

1114
01:04:33,320 --> 01:04:35,400
You only said, Listen up, bro!

1115
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:36,680
I am getting married, yo!

1116
01:04:36,680 --> 01:04:38,040
You are invited, bro!

1117
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:40,680
You should come and watch my wedding.

1118
01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:42,760
You were going crazy.

1119
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:45,240
I cannot help it if she falls for me.

1120
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:48,760
I might not be powerful here.
But I dare you to come to Hyderabad.

1121
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:51,240
I will talk to my mom and
increase the rent by 15K.

1122
01:04:51,240 --> 01:04:52,760
That is such a weird warning, man.

1123
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:53,680
Go. Go. Go on.

1124
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:54,880
You are supposed to attend
a wedding bearing gifts.

1125
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:56,400
Not impress the bride
and take her with you.

1126
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:58,720
How is it my fault that
she is flattered by me?

1127
01:04:58,840 --> 01:05:00,520
I knew it when I saw you guys.

1128
01:05:00,520 --> 01:05:01,760
You are really a psycho killers gang.

1129
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:03,840
Govind, your life is ruined!

1130
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:05,080
This banner is equal to shit now.

1131
01:05:05,080 --> 01:05:07,240
Man, your marriage got fixed because of me.

1132
01:05:07,240 --> 01:05:08,640
You owe me.

1133
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:10,320
Get on the bus. Come on!

1134
01:05:10,360 --> 01:05:12,360
I will show you what I am made of,
once we get home.

1135
01:05:13,960 --> 01:05:14,520
Excuse me.

1136
01:05:15,720 --> 01:05:17,520
Mr. Venkata Ramana wants
you at the wedding venue.

1137
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:17,600
Mr. Venkata Ramana wants
you at the wedding venue.

1138
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:18,680
Coming.

1139
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:23,520
Hello.

1140
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:27,400
Please come. Sit.

1141
01:05:37,320 --> 01:05:41,280
I thought the entire village will bless my
daughter at the wedding and head home.

1142
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:44,920
But they headed home
laughing at me mockingly.

1143
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:49,760
More than power and stature.

1144
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:52,240
My daughters happiness
is more important to me now.

1145
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:59,080
I have had this feeling that maybe
she does not want this wedding.

1146
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:05,600
When she pointed at you
and said she had marry you.

1147
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:07,680
I felt shaken at first.

1148
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:11,440
But when I thought about it.

1149
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:14,440
I realized that if everything goes to plan.

1150
01:06:14,520 --> 01:06:16,240
There is no point to the existence of God.

1151
01:06:20,080 --> 01:06:21,880
Will you marry my daughter?

1152
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:30,320
Do not worry. It is my responsibility
to protect your power and stature.

1153
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:31,000
Do not worry. It is my responsibility
to protect your power and stature.

1154
01:06:31,040 --> 01:06:33,960
Your daughter pointed at me and
said I am the only guy she will ever marry.

1155
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:35,200
Your daughter pointed at me and
said I am the only guy she will ever marry.

1156
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:36,560
It is destiny, sir.

1157
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:37,920
It is not in our hands really.

1158
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:42,960
You can talk to my parents
and then fix the date.

1159
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:47,280
And if you do not mind,
can I talk to your daughter once?

1160
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:49,800
Of course, you can.

1161
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:51,800
Go. Go.
Thanks, sir.

1162
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:54,680
Krishna uncle, why did you leave
the lights on? Pack up everything.

1163
01:06:57,480 --> 01:06:58,280
Hi.

1164
01:06:59,560 --> 01:07:02,640
Listen, it is all been pretty
confusing since last night.

1165
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:06,280
You looked at me and
immediately said that you love me.

1166
01:07:06,320 --> 01:07:08,520
That you would not marry anybody but me.

1167
01:07:08,840 --> 01:07:11,720
But, you do not even know me.

1168
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:14,480
Sir! Who says I do not know you?

1169
01:07:14,840 --> 01:07:15,680
Sir?

1170
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:17,800
You are our God in disguise.

1171
01:07:18,040 --> 01:07:21,160
What? God in disguise? And me?

1172
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:22,000
How?

1173
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:25,800
You should peek into my
story if you want to know me.

1174
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:31,360
We went to my aunts place for
the summer after 10th grade exams.

1175
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:47,520
Wow! Love is such a great feeling, right?

1176
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:49,520
Hey! Your brother Rahul is here.

1177
01:07:49,960 --> 01:07:51,000
When did you come?

1178
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:54,920
Rahul had a love failure
and attempted suicide.

1179
01:07:55,120 --> 01:07:56,400
That’s when I thought.

1180
01:07:56,480 --> 01:08:00,160
Whoa! Maybe love is not
as mushy as in the movies.

1181
01:08:00,440 --> 01:08:04,480
We had a lecturer called Sirisha.
She was always smiling.

1182
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:06,960
She got married and then a month later.

1183
01:08:07,080 --> 01:08:08,480
We saw her crying.

1184
01:08:08,760 --> 01:08:10,160
Her husband was a psycho.

1185
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:12,600
He had torture her for something
as petty as smiling and crying.

1186
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:14,320
That’s when I thought again.

1187
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:18,480
Whoa! So marriage isn’t
such a mushy affair either.

1188
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:22,120
When I was in a dilemma whether
to accept love and marriage.

1189
01:08:22,360 --> 01:08:23,560
I heard a voice.

1190
01:08:23,560 --> 01:08:25,840
We should badly condemn love and marriage.

1191
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:28,120
Yes! Yes! Yes!

1192
01:08:30,320 --> 01:08:32,640
We get irritated to chop
vegetables at home.

1193
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:33,960
But when we fail in love.

1194
01:08:33,960 --> 01:08:37,160
We do not think twice to slit our wrists.

1195
01:08:37,160 --> 01:08:39,200
Why do you want torture in your life, huh?

1196
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:42,960
No! We should strongly
condemn love and marriage.

1197
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:46,160
Yes! Yes! Yes!

1198
01:08:49,440 --> 01:08:52,520
You are my God in disguise, sir.

1199
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:56,200
Every poem of yours has changed my life.

1200
01:08:58,120 --> 01:08:58,800
And then?

1201
01:08:59,080 --> 01:09:01,800
Sir, you do not fancy the
concept of love anyway.

1202
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:03,520
And you are strictly against marriage.

1203
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:06,000
Even God cannot convince you.

1204
01:09:06,040 --> 01:09:06,880
My dad does not stand a chance.

1205
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:07,480
My dad does not stand a chance.

1206
01:09:08,160 --> 01:09:12,400
So, I thought I could escape,
using you as the bait.

1207
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:15,200
Escape, huh?

1208
01:09:15,960 --> 01:09:18,600
Back then,
you came into my life and gave me clarity.

1209
01:09:18,680 --> 01:09:21,400
Now, you have come back into
my life to show me a way out.

1210
01:09:21,720 --> 01:09:22,920
You are just amazing, sir.

1211
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:25,040
He came back to save me.

1212
01:09:26,160 --> 01:09:27,680
Sir, give me your number.

1213
01:09:28,240 --> 01:09:29,040
988

1214
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:29,720
988

1215
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:31,200
56

1216
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:32,560
03

1217
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:33,560
64.
64.

1218
01:09:34,120 --> 01:09:35,880
Sir, I will call you as
soon as I arrive in Vizag.

1219
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:38,160
Bye, sir. Thank you!

1220
01:09:38,160 --> 01:09:38,920
Okay.

1221
01:09:57,960 --> 01:09:59,600
Mom, what are you looking at?

1222
01:10:00,520 --> 01:10:02,880
You never visit, despite my repeated calls.

1223
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:06,880
Now that you did out of the blue,
looks like it’s going to rain.

1224
01:10:06,920 --> 01:10:08,080
I am shocked.

1225
01:10:08,200 --> 01:10:09,840
That is too much.
Let us go inside.

1226
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:10,880
Hmm.

1227
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:14,560
Hey! What brings you home suddenly?

1228
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:16,080
Are you here on some work?

1229
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:20,240
I am here for a friend’s wedding.

1230
01:10:23,080 --> 01:10:25,840
Hey! If there are any clothes outside,
bring them in.

1231
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:27,640
It is definitely going to run. Go!

1232
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:34,200
A girl who believes in your philosophy,
showed up in your life.

1233
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:36,720
On top of that, she used you
to escape from the wedding, eh?

1234
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:39,800
That is what they call destiny.

1235
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:42,120
So, did you like the girl?

1236
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:43,960
I mean.

1237
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:46,400
I do, uncle.

1238
01:10:46,440 --> 01:10:47,880
You are blushing. That is a first.

1239
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:52,680
Hello.

1240
01:10:52,680 --> 01:10:54,760
Hello! It is me, sir. Amrutha.

1241
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:56,080
Yeah, tell me.

1242
01:10:56,120 --> 01:10:57,240
I am also in Vizag.

1243
01:10:58,080 --> 01:11:01,160
If you are free tomorrow,
some of us friends are going out.

1244
01:11:01,240 --> 01:11:03,160
If you could come with me.

1245
01:11:03,160 --> 01:11:05,240
I am free. I will definitely join you.

1246
01:11:05,240 --> 01:11:06,800
Okay, sir! Bye.

1247
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:10,280
Take care.

1248
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:14,880
Hey. Where are we going?

1249
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:16,320
Lankagramam, sir. It is nearby.

1250
01:11:16,680 --> 01:11:18,240
Due to the recent storm.

1251
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:21,280
Fishermen lost their nets and boats.

1252
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:23,920
We collected funds and bought a few nets.

1253
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:25,160
Now we are going to distribute them.

1254
01:11:25,160 --> 01:11:25,960
Nice.

1255
01:11:26,440 --> 01:11:28,360
Where are you currently placed?

1256
01:11:28,720 --> 01:11:31,440
I am working as a junior
lecturer in our college.

1257
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:33,280
Oh! Very nice.

1258
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:34,480
Our college.

1259
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:37,840
I have a doubt.
Tell me, sir.

1260
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:39,160
Because I was at the wedding.

1261
01:11:39,160 --> 01:11:40,680
you pointed at me and
got the wedding called off.

1262
01:11:40,760 --> 01:11:41,760
What if I had not showed up?

1263
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:43,000
I would have gotten married, sir.

1264
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:43,440
What?

1265
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:43,920
What?

1266
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:45,680
Yes. I would have gone in
for my nuptial night as well.

1267
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:49,680
I had decided to come out
of the bedroom in 10 minutes?

1268
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:50,720
and declare that Govind is impotent.

1269
01:11:50,720 --> 01:11:51,240
and declare that Govind is impotent.

1270
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:54,200
Govind.

1271
01:11:54,200 --> 01:11:55,160
Is not that a great plan?

1272
01:11:55,200 --> 01:11:57,480
Yeah. Yeah. Mind blowing plan.

1273
01:11:57,480 --> 01:11:58,520
Mind blowing!

1274
01:12:08,160 --> 01:12:10,880
God bless you, dear!

1275
01:12:18,120 --> 01:12:19,000
What is this?

1276
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:20,600
What is this, huh?

1277
01:12:21,720 --> 01:12:24,880
How could you get on with
this without intimating me first?

1278
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:30,520
Even I have lost nets
and boats. Give me 10 nets.

1279
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:31,160
10?

1280
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:34,520
Ravan has 10 heads.
Give me a net per each head.

1281
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:36,800
Who is he, bro?

1282
01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:39,000
He is like bad omen in this village.

1283
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:42,040
He cannot take it when
something is going well.

1284
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:44,520
Hope he drowns with the hurricane.

1285
01:12:44,600 --> 01:12:46,800
Hey! Go get the money.

1286
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:49,080
Hey!

1287
01:12:50,720 --> 01:12:52,800
Take your hands off.

1288
01:12:52,840 --> 01:12:53,960
Respect women.

1289
01:12:53,960 --> 01:12:57,480
Oi! Who the hell are you? Huh?

1290
01:12:57,720 --> 01:12:58,280
Who are you?

1291
01:12:58,520 --> 01:13:00,400
Why do you care, bro?

1292
01:13:01,240 --> 01:13:02,600
I have been watching you, okay?

1293
01:13:02,720 --> 01:13:04,640
You talk about Ravan and Lanka.

1294
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:06,560
Looks like you are well versed in the epics.

1295
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:08,040
Because I love Ravan.

1296
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:09,920
There is this small drama.
Would you like to be a part of it?

1297
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:11,040
What drama?

1298
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:12,880
Suppose, just suppose.

1299
01:13:13,480 --> 01:13:15,520
You are the Ravan of this Lanka.

1300
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:16,760
Yes. Yes.

1301
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
This is Goddess Sitas hermitage.

1302
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:23,360
You should enter like Ravan
and kidnap Goddess Sita.

1303
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:25,760
You get everything there is here.

1304
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:27,000
Where is Sita, bro?

1305
01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:29,640
He is Sita. Just take him, bro.

1306
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:32,480
Sita, what are you looking at?
Go to your hermitage.

1307
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:34,960
Go fast.

1308
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:38,760
It is the epics. Let us go in order.

1309
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:43,600
You should cross the line
drawn by Laxman to take Sita.

1310
01:13:44,240 --> 01:13:46,360
Laxman Oh, Laxman.

1311
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:46,880
Bro!

1312
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:48,680
Come quickly and draw the line.

1313
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:51,000
Coming. Coming.

1314
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,920
Come. Come. Quick.

1315
01:13:56,840 --> 01:13:58,200
Here goes the line, bro!

1316
01:13:58,280 --> 01:14:00,640
It is not really the line drawn by Laxman.

1317
01:14:00,680 --> 01:14:02,440
Cross it and get Sita. Go!

1318
01:14:23,560 --> 01:14:25,360
Where are you going?
Bro! Bro! Bro!

1319
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:28,600
Want to cross Laxmans line?
Not so easy.

1320
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:31,240
Want to cross the line, is it?

1321
01:14:31,240 --> 01:14:32,560
Try. Try. Try.

1322
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:34,880
Hey, bro! What’s going on?

1323
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:38,040
It is the line drawn by Laxman.
It possesses powers.

1324
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:40,960
Be careful when you cross.

1325
01:14:42,920 --> 01:14:44,640
Ravans soldiers are down.

1326
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:47,280
It is time for Ravan
to enter the battlefield.

1327
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:48,320
Come on. Quick.

1328
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:50,840
Ravan will enter. No doubt about it.

1329
01:14:56,520 --> 01:14:57,920
Why did you stop, bro?

1330
01:14:58,200 --> 01:15:00,440
I get the part about the
line drawn by Laxman.

1331
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:02,520
But, would not that contradict
the course of the tale?

1332
01:15:03,200 --> 01:15:04,320
What do you mean, bro?

1333
01:15:04,360 --> 01:15:07,280
Sita crosses the line
and Ravan kidnaps her.

1334
01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:09,880
Ravan does not cross the line in the story.
It is wrong.

1335
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:13,000
That is a good logic, bro.

1336
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:14,520
You are right.
I know.

1337
01:15:14,520 --> 01:15:16,520
Sita, cross the line and come forward.

1338
01:15:16,520 --> 01:15:19,160
I am here for you.
Do it.

1339
01:15:19,400 --> 01:15:21,160
Cross it. Cross it.

1340
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:24,760
Sita crossed the line, dude!

1341
01:15:25,880 --> 01:15:28,240
Bro! What are you doing?

1342
01:15:28,240 --> 01:15:31,360
It is easy to kidnap Sita
when Rama is not around.

1343
01:15:31,560 --> 01:15:33,880
But when Rama is in the hermitage.

1344
01:15:33,880 --> 01:15:37,720
You should know how it
feels to kidnap Sita. Bro!

1345
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:46,680
Come on, Ravan. Come on.
Leave me, bro.

1346
01:15:46,680 --> 01:15:50,200
If he is Ravan, that
makes you his soldier, eh?

1347
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:52,640
I know how to teach you a lesson.

1348
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:55,200
You call this Lanka and yourself Ravan, eh?

1349
01:15:56,680 --> 01:15:59,880
I am going to rip your skin off.

1350
01:15:59,960 --> 01:16:01,720
Bro, no!
Bro, stop!

1351
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:03,560
Come on, Ravan. Come on!

1352
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:05,320
Ravan, my foot!

1353
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:09,280
He smacked us like hell, bro.

1354
01:16:09,280 --> 01:16:12,840
When Rama is in the hermitage,
you do not mess with Sita, guys.

1355
01:16:12,840 --> 01:16:12,920
When Rama is in the hermitage,
you do not mess with Sita, guys.

1356
01:16:13,480 --> 01:16:14,560
Drive the chariot.

1357
01:16:15,360 --> 01:16:16,840
Grandpa, here you go.

1358
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:20,520
After today, it feels like.

1359
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:23,560
If only Lord Rama was
with Goddess Sita that day.

1360
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,920
Goddess Sita wouldn’t
have to go through so much.

1361
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,040
Grandpa has great timing!

1362
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:42,000
Goddess Sita should
always be beside Lord Rama.

1363
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:43,800
Goddess Sita should
always be beside Lord Rama.

1364
01:16:45,240 --> 01:16:46,640
This is the correct frame.

1365
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:51,400
Hey, is this me?

1366
01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:53,600
Hey, is this real?

1367
01:16:53,680 --> 01:16:58,040
I look new to myself

1368
01:16:58,200 --> 01:17:04,800
This solo life is pushing me towards you
after meeting you.

1369
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:07,240
Love has reached me this way.

1370
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:10,720
Bye, sir!
-Bye.

1371
01:17:11,440 --> 01:17:12,760
Strange.
-Sir!

1372
01:17:13,320 --> 01:17:14,800
You are just amazing, sir!

1373
01:17:15,080 --> 01:17:16,480
Why do you say that?

1374
01:17:16,480 --> 01:17:18,760
You knocked the shit out of them.

1375
01:17:18,760 --> 01:17:20,360
Oh, that.

1376
01:17:20,360 --> 01:17:23,600
You are always around,
whenever I am in a tough situation.

1377
01:17:24,720 --> 01:17:27,360
I swear.
It feels great to have you by my side.

1378
01:17:28,120 --> 01:17:28,880
Bye, sir!

1379
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:12,720
She has met me and
brought sparkle in my eyes

1380
01:18:13,080 --> 01:18:17,320
She sounded like a new music.

1381
01:18:17,560 --> 01:18:22,080
She smiled like diamonds flooded the place.

1382
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:26,040
She shined like a full moon in the sea.

1383
01:18:26,040 --> 01:18:30,600
The sky has turned into rainbow for me.

1384
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:35,120
If this opportunity is skipped,
I will not get it back

1385
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:39,680
If you accept,
i will stay with you as your husband

1386
01:18:39,720 --> 01:18:45,000
It feels like this has already happened

1387
01:18:45,080 --> 01:18:47,320
Hey, is this me?

1388
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:49,600
Hey, is this real?

1389
01:18:49,680 --> 01:18:52,880
I look new to myself

1390
01:18:52,880 --> 01:18:53,000
Virat i love you
I look new to myself

1391
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,480
Virat I love you
Virat i love you

1392
01:18:55,480 --> 01:18:55,640
Virat I love you

1393
01:18:55,640 --> 01:19:03,200
This solo life is pushing me towards you
after meeting you?

1394
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:16,160
Sir, let us dance.

1395
01:19:16,160 --> 01:19:17,400
Sir, let us dance sir.
Sir, let us dance.

1396
01:19:17,400 --> 01:19:17,560
Sir, let us dance sir.

1397
01:19:17,560 --> 01:19:18,800
Come sir. Please
No
Come, Sir. Please.
-No. Please.

1398
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:18,840
Come, Sir. Please.
-No. Please.

1399
01:19:18,840 --> 01:19:19,640
Please sir Come.
Come, Sir. Please.
-No. Please.

1400
01:19:19,640 --> 01:19:19,880
Please sir Come.

1401
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:20,600
Come on!
Please sir Come.

1402
01:19:48,040 --> 01:19:50,880
It’s like a snow fall in the summer

1403
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:52,720
Something miracle has happened

1404
01:19:52,760 --> 01:19:55,560
And I cannot believe it.

1405
01:19:57,280 --> 01:19:59,880
It is like a monsoon in the winter

1406
01:19:59,880 --> 01:20:01,800
Many wonders are happening

1407
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:04,720
And I promise, you’ve done all these.

1408
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:11,720
My life completely feels new.

1409
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:16,200
It was like this, never before.

1410
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:18,600
Hey, is this me?

1411
01:20:18,640 --> 01:20:20,880
Hey, is this real?

1412
01:20:20,960 --> 01:20:25,160
I look new to myself

1413
01:20:25,480 --> 01:20:34,240
This solo life is pushing me towards you
after meeting you.

1414
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:57,360
Hey, is this me?

1415
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:01,960
Hey, is this real?

1416
01:21:02,520 --> 01:21:05,160
Sir, you
-Tell me.

1417
01:21:05,640 --> 01:21:07,680
You should come to our college tomorrow.

1418
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:10,920
Why?
-Surprise!

1419
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:13,440
I will tell you when you come.

1420
01:21:13,680 --> 01:21:14,160
Oh!

1421
01:21:14,840 --> 01:21:16,360
Surprise, huh. I will be there.
-Yay.

1422
01:21:16,360 --> 01:21:18,640
10:00 clock sharp.
-I will be there by 09:30.

1423
01:21:26,480 --> 01:21:27,720
Sir, please come.

1424
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:28,480
Come where?

1425
01:21:28,480 --> 01:21:29,520
I will tell you. Come with me.

1426
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:30,360
Coming.

1427
01:21:32,600 --> 01:21:33,240
Oh. Sorry.

1428
01:21:33,240 --> 01:21:33,280
Oh. Sorry.

1429
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:38,200
Yeah, please.

1430
01:21:38,440 --> 01:21:39,680
You said it is a surprise.

1431
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:41,280
Why do you keep me waiting?

1432
01:21:41,280 --> 01:21:42,560
Just say what it is.

1433
01:21:42,760 --> 01:21:44,120
I will tell you. Come with me.

1434
01:21:44,120 --> 01:21:46,200
I know you will tell me. But.

1435
01:21:58,000 --> 01:21:58,960
What is this?

1436
01:21:59,000 --> 01:21:59,920
It is nice, right?

1437
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,320
Yeah, but.

1438
01:22:01,320 --> 01:22:03,720
The cut-out and grand welcome.

1439
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:04,680
What is going on?

1440
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:06,480
There is more.

1441
01:22:06,480 --> 01:22:07,600
What? There’s more?

1442
01:22:08,240 --> 01:22:09,560
What do you mean?

1443
01:22:10,920 --> 01:22:11,760
Oh, god!

1444
01:22:13,800 --> 01:22:15,040
What's happening?
-Sir!

1445
01:22:16,240 --> 01:22:18,320
Do not just stand there.
There is more to the surprise.

1446
01:22:18,320 --> 01:22:19,440
Surprise?
Yeah.

1447
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:20,640
What surprise?

1448
01:22:20,640 --> 01:22:21,720
Come. I will show you.

1449
01:22:23,680 --> 01:22:26,200
Virat sir! Virat sir!

1450
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:46,640
One more cut out?

1451
01:22:47,560 --> 01:22:48,960
How many more, guys?

1452
01:22:50,280 --> 01:22:53,960
Okay. Okay. Cool.
Yeah. Yeah. Sit down.

1453
01:22:55,840 --> 01:22:57,080
They are all.

1454
01:22:57,160 --> 01:22:59,280
They are our union members, sir!

1455
01:22:59,320 --> 01:23:02,480
We expanded the Union after you left.

1456
01:23:03,240 --> 01:23:04,520
Our Union?

1457
01:23:04,520 --> 01:23:07,920
We want your speech!

1458
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:08,080
We want your speech!

1459
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:11,080
We want your speech!

1460
01:23:11,080 --> 01:23:12,120
What speech?

1461
01:23:12,680 --> 01:23:13,920
This speech, sir.

1462
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:16,200
But I did not prepare.

1463
01:23:18,040 --> 01:23:18,840
Please! Please! Please, sir!

1464
01:23:18,840 --> 01:23:21,240
Please! Please! Please, sir!

1465
01:23:21,240 --> 01:23:22,760
Okay. Okay.

1466
01:23:25,200 --> 01:23:27,680
Okay. Okay. Please calm down.

1467
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:34,680
In life, after a certain time.

1468
01:23:34,680 --> 01:23:37,280
Love becomes
- Solo life is so better.

1469
01:23:38,360 --> 01:23:39,880
They are hard to ignore.

1470
01:23:40,520 --> 01:23:41,960
Okay. Okay.

1471
01:23:42,440 --> 01:23:44,760
Okay. Calm down.

1472
01:23:46,840 --> 01:23:50,280
In life, after a certain time,
marriage becomes.

1473
01:23:50,280 --> 01:23:53,000
Solo Life Is So Better!
Solo Life Is So Better!

1474
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:54,120
What the hell!

1475
01:23:55,040 --> 01:23:58,880
Please calm down. Please!

1476
01:24:00,120 --> 01:24:02,720
Sir, Please, huh.

1477
01:24:06,240 --> 01:24:07,600
Poem no. 48!

1478
01:24:08,400 --> 01:24:10,880
Lovers look happy only
when they are taking a selfie.

1479
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:14,200
Married couples look happy
only for the wedding photographs.

1480
01:24:14,200 --> 01:24:16,000
Rest of the time, they are sad as hell.

1481
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:19,840
We are confined to a
coffin after death anyway.

1482
01:24:20,320 --> 01:24:23,680
At least when we are alive,
let’s live out of the box.

1483
01:24:25,800 --> 01:24:27,840
Damn! They are not stopping.

1484
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:29,680
She is not stopping either.

1485
01:24:30,840 --> 01:24:31,640
Solo! Solo!

1486
01:24:31,640 --> 01:24:32,320
Solo! Solo!

1487
01:24:32,320 --> 01:24:35,280
Finally, what is our slogan?

1488
01:24:35,280 --> 01:24:35,520
Finally, what is our slogan?

1489
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:37,200
Solo Life Is So Better!

1490
01:24:42,240 --> 01:24:46,760
Sir! I know you fumbled during the speech
because you have not done this in so long.

1491
01:24:46,840 --> 01:24:49,200
Actually, I prepared a different speech.

1492
01:24:49,320 --> 01:24:49,840
Oh.

1493
01:24:50,080 --> 01:24:52,400
But, you rocked!

1494
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:53,560
Thank you, sir.

1495
01:24:53,800 --> 01:24:59,520
I never expected that a small initiative
by me will grow into something as big.

1496
01:24:59,560 --> 01:25:00,920
Sir, I have one more thing to tell you.

1497
01:25:01,200 --> 01:25:03,080
One more thing?

1498
01:25:03,480 --> 01:25:07,400
In 10 days, there is a huge
college fest in Andhra University.

1499
01:25:07,400 --> 01:25:10,760
We are talking about our
philosophy in that fest.

1500
01:25:10,760 --> 01:25:11,960
Just imagine, sir.

1501
01:25:12,280 --> 01:25:14,120
There were only 500 members here.

1502
01:25:14,160 --> 01:25:16,160
There, we will have 5000 members.

1503
01:25:16,200 --> 01:25:16,880
Oh!

1504
01:25:17,280 --> 01:25:18,640
5000 members!

1505
01:25:18,640 --> 01:25:19,280
Hmm.

1506
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:19,960
Very nice.

1507
01:25:20,280 --> 01:25:21,920
Good spirit.
Thank you, sir.

1508
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:24,120
I have your support, right?

1509
01:25:24,240 --> 01:25:26,080
Of course, you do. Why not?

1510
01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:29,360
Who is the Founder?
You.

1511
01:25:29,640 --> 01:25:30,600
Right.

1512
01:25:30,680 --> 01:25:31,720
Who wrote that book?

1513
01:25:31,720 --> 01:25:32,440
You again.

1514
01:25:32,440 --> 01:25:34,400
I am that idiot. I mean, I am the writer.

1515
01:25:34,400 --> 01:25:35,640
Of course. It is you!

1516
01:25:35,880 --> 01:25:37,480
You will definitely have my full support.

1517
01:25:37,480 --> 01:25:39,240
Do not worry. God bless you.
-Thank you so much, sir!

1518
01:25:39,280 --> 01:25:40,760
I have got something to take care of.

1519
01:25:41,400 --> 01:25:44,040
I will see you later.
Sure, sir. Sure.

1520
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:45,760
Bye.
Bye, sir.

1521
01:25:45,760 --> 01:25:47,360
Thank you so much, sir!

1522
01:25:47,360 --> 01:25:48,680
Yes!

1523
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:54,000
Hello.

1524
01:25:54,040 --> 01:25:55,000
Where are you?

1525
01:25:55,080 --> 01:25:57,040
100 meters away from a mental asylum.

1526
01:25:57,040 --> 01:25:58,080
First tell me who you are.

1527
01:25:58,880 --> 01:26:01,040
I am Amrutha father.

1528
01:26:01,440 --> 01:26:02,960
Uncle Uncle Sorry.

1529
01:26:02,960 --> 01:26:04,160
I do not have your number.

1530
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:05,280
Tell me.

1531
01:26:05,680 --> 01:26:06,640
It is okay.

1532
01:26:06,760 --> 01:26:08,200
What are you doing there anyway?

1533
01:26:08,480 --> 01:26:11,080
I am visiting somebody I know.

1534
01:26:11,640 --> 01:26:13,760
Priest wants to fix a date.

1535
01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:15,320
Did you speak with your family?

1536
01:26:15,320 --> 01:26:17,000
Before that, I need to talk to you.

1537
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:19,080
I am coming down to your place.

1538
01:26:19,440 --> 01:26:21,400
Sure. Definitely. Come.

1539
01:26:25,080 --> 01:26:25,560
Come.

1540
01:26:29,800 --> 01:26:30,880
Wash your feet.

1541
01:26:36,160 --> 01:26:38,400
Come on! Do it properly.

1542
01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:40,600
Wash them. I will pour the water.

1543
01:26:40,600 --> 01:26:41,880
It is okay.
Wash them.

1544
01:26:41,880 --> 01:26:42,560
Nice.

1545
01:26:43,560 --> 01:26:44,160
Now come in.

1546
01:26:44,760 --> 01:26:45,400
Come. Sit.

1547
01:26:45,400 --> 01:26:46,280
Have it.
No, thanks.

1548
01:26:46,520 --> 01:26:47,360
Give me that towel.

1549
01:26:47,440 --> 01:26:49,320
Go and take care of the lunch arrangements.

1550
01:26:49,360 --> 01:26:49,800
Alright.

1551
01:26:49,800 --> 01:26:51,320
Sit down.
-You also sit down.

1552
01:26:55,160 --> 01:26:57,720
Did you talk to your
parents about the marriage?

1553
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:01,720
Please pay attention
to what I’m about to say.

1554
01:27:03,480 --> 01:27:05,120
That day at the wedding.

1555
01:27:05,160 --> 01:27:08,520
Your daughter did not point at
me so that she could marry me.

1556
01:27:11,040 --> 01:27:14,560
She did it to completely
avoid the concept of marriage.

1557
01:27:15,720 --> 01:27:19,040
And the reason she has strongly
decided against marriage is also.

1558
01:27:21,280 --> 01:27:22,120
Me!

1559
01:27:28,040 --> 01:27:28,640
Brother-in-law.

1560
01:27:29,120 --> 01:27:30,680
Hey. What brings you here?

1561
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:32,760
My elder daughter is getting married.

1562
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:34,400
That is great news.

1563
01:27:35,320 --> 01:27:36,640
What does the guy do?

1564
01:27:36,640 --> 01:27:38,440
He works in Mahindra in Hyderabad.

1565
01:27:38,440 --> 01:27:39,480
You brought good news.

1566
01:27:39,480 --> 01:27:42,360
Lucky man! Go and tell this to your sister.

1567
01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:44,200
Sister Sister

1568
01:27:45,040 --> 01:27:46,360
My elder daughter is getting married.

1569
01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:47,960
That is my brother-in-law.

1570
01:27:48,520 --> 01:27:51,120
His daughter is getting married.

1571
01:27:55,680 --> 01:27:57,240
I really like your daughter, sir.

1572
01:27:58,800 --> 01:28:00,760
I have decided to marry her.

1573
01:28:01,080 --> 01:28:03,600
Actually, I am here to tell you that.

1574
01:28:03,880 --> 01:28:06,280
I promise you that I will change your
daughter is opinion and marry her.

1575
01:28:06,320 --> 01:28:07,160
Trust me.

1576
01:28:07,360 --> 01:28:08,520
How can I?

1577
01:28:09,320 --> 01:28:10,560
First, you were against love.

1578
01:28:10,760 --> 01:28:12,000
Then you were against marriage.

1579
01:28:12,160 --> 01:28:13,720
You preached the same to everybody.

1580
01:28:13,840 --> 01:28:16,000
My daughter got influenced
and said no to marriage.

1581
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:21,240
Even the huge Earth we live on,
it rotates methodically.

1582
01:28:21,560 --> 01:28:23,520
Process is the core of Nature.

1583
01:28:23,640 --> 01:28:24,640
How can you deny that
and make such decisions?

1584
01:28:24,640 --> 01:28:26,960
How can you deny that
and make such decisions?

1585
01:28:28,600 --> 01:28:30,280
Even the Earth that rotates methodically.

1586
01:28:30,280 --> 01:28:32,040
It has earthquakes sometimes.

1587
01:28:33,240 --> 01:28:35,840
It takes time to adjust.

1588
01:28:35,960 --> 01:28:37,200
Give us time, sir.

1589
01:28:41,280 --> 01:28:43,320
I will leave. Bye.

1590
01:28:43,960 --> 01:28:45,120
Have lunch and go.

1591
01:28:50,600 --> 01:28:52,000
Hey, Chaitu. When did you come?

1592
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:53,240
This morning.

1593
01:28:53,240 --> 01:28:55,720
Did you hear? My art has fans in Japan.

1594
01:28:55,720 --> 01:28:57,600
They are going crazy with our stuff.

1595
01:28:58,360 --> 01:29:00,080
Hey, Virat! Why are you late, bro?

1596
01:29:00,080 --> 01:29:01,480
Come on. Enjoy the party. Come.

1597
01:29:01,960 --> 01:29:02,520
Coming, bro.

1598
01:29:02,520 --> 01:29:03,320
No one called you, bro.

1599
01:29:03,320 --> 01:29:04,000
They did.

1600
01:29:04,280 --> 01:29:04,880
Coming. Coming.

1601
01:29:08,520 --> 01:29:10,400
I put him in an uncomfortable spot.

1602
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:12,000
And he asked me to have lunch before I go.

1603
01:29:15,440 --> 01:29:18,920
Today, I witnessed a father’s joy,
whose daughter was going to get married.

1604
01:29:19,640 --> 01:29:22,480
Also a father is distress, who is worried
that his daughter will not get married.

1605
01:29:23,080 --> 01:29:25,240
I caused him that fear and anxiety.

1606
01:29:27,320 --> 01:29:30,400
That is why I should end what I started.

1607
01:29:30,720 --> 01:29:34,280
Otherwise, this guilt
will haunt me forever.

1608
01:29:34,760 --> 01:29:36,000
Why do not you just tell her, man?

1609
01:29:36,040 --> 01:29:36,920
How can I?

1610
01:29:36,920 --> 01:29:38,560
Do you know what she says when we meet?

1611
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:39,800
Sir, you are great.

1612
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:41,000
Sir, you are amazing.

1613
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:42,960
Sir, you are out of the world.

1614
01:29:43,280 --> 01:29:44,240
When she says such stuff.

1615
01:29:44,280 --> 01:29:45,840
What do you expect me to say in return?

1616
01:29:47,120 --> 01:29:49,360
Alright. Suppose I tell her
like you just asked me to.

1617
01:29:49,360 --> 01:29:50,240
Suppose.

1618
01:29:50,320 --> 01:29:51,240
What if she is not convinced?

1619
01:29:51,240 --> 01:29:52,800
What then?

1620
01:29:54,200 --> 01:29:55,680
She will not trust me ever again.

1621
01:29:55,680 --> 01:29:55,840
She will not trust me ever again.

1622
01:29:56,080 --> 01:29:57,320
I cannot take that risk, dude.

1623
01:29:57,320 --> 01:29:58,120
I just cannot.

1624
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:00,240
What do you say we do now?

1625
01:30:00,400 --> 01:30:02,400
That meeting can not happen, no matter what.

1626
01:30:02,440 --> 01:30:04,160
The only way to do that is to change them.

1627
01:30:04,160 --> 01:30:05,240
And the only way to change them is.

1628
01:30:05,240 --> 01:30:08,000
I should make Amrutha turn off
her brain and feel from her heart.

1629
01:30:08,280 --> 01:30:09,280
Stop it, man!

1630
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:16,800
Now I get why Lord Hanuman’s statue
is placed at the outskirts of the village.

1631
01:30:16,880 --> 01:30:17,680
Why?

1632
01:30:18,040 --> 01:30:19,880
Lord Hanuman is not married.

1633
01:30:19,960 --> 01:30:21,640
So they put him near the
border to guard the place.

1634
01:30:24,720 --> 01:30:26,560
Oh. It is dads birthday.

1635
01:30:27,800 --> 01:30:29,680
Drink quickly. My wife’s calling.

1636
01:30:43,640 --> 01:30:44,840
Mom
-Yes?

1637
01:30:44,920 --> 01:30:46,200
Put daddy on the line, please.

1638
01:30:46,840 --> 01:30:47,880
Dear

1639
01:30:48,120 --> 01:30:48,800
It’s Virat.

1640
01:30:53,720 --> 01:30:54,560
Hello, Virat.

1641
01:30:55,520 --> 01:30:56,160
Hello, dad.

1642
01:30:57,800 --> 01:30:59,320
The thing is.

1643
01:30:59,440 --> 01:31:00,040
What?

1644
01:31:00,720 --> 01:31:01,800
Happy birthday, dad.

1645
01:31:03,080 --> 01:31:04,360
Are you drunk?

1646
01:31:04,400 --> 01:31:05,840
Oh, my god! No!

1647
01:31:06,040 --> 01:31:07,600
I just wanted to tell you and I did.

1648
01:31:07,800 --> 01:31:09,400
Alright. Come home soon.

1649
01:31:09,640 --> 01:31:10,840
Sure. Bye.

1650
01:31:11,640 --> 01:31:12,680
What is gotten into him?

1651
01:31:12,880 --> 01:31:14,920
He said birthday wishes
and gave me a shocker.

1652
01:31:16,080 --> 01:31:18,880
Everybody falls in
love with my paintings.

1653
01:31:19,120 --> 01:31:21,120
I will tell you the technique.

1654
01:31:21,400 --> 01:31:22,120
You can go.

1655
01:31:22,160 --> 01:31:24,640
He will explain the depth
of the painting. Go.

1656
01:31:25,320 --> 01:31:28,520
Hey, Virat! You should come
to my art exhibition tomorrow.

1657
01:31:29,160 --> 01:31:31,240
It is my best work.

1658
01:31:31,720 --> 01:31:35,160
With this, FF Hussain will
become MF Hussain. Wait and see.

1659
01:31:40,640 --> 01:31:42,800
Hey! Did you prep FF Hussain properly?

1660
01:31:42,800 --> 01:31:45,120
Bro, do not worry.
I have got it under control.

1661
01:31:45,160 --> 01:31:46,120
That is why I am worried.

1662
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:20,440
Hi, sir.

1663
01:32:21,600 --> 01:32:24,240
Amrutha, you look ho.

1664
01:32:27,680 --> 01:32:28,760
You look really beautiful in this saree.

1665
01:32:28,760 --> 01:32:29,720
Thank you, sir.

1666
01:32:39,400 --> 01:32:40,400
Where are we, sir?

1667
01:32:40,960 --> 01:32:42,840
I told you about an important
person in my life, right?

1668
01:32:43,200 --> 01:32:44,240
We’re here to meet him.

1669
01:32:44,520 --> 01:32:45,680
Okay.
-Please.

1670
01:32:47,960 --> 01:32:49,360
Hi, uncle.
Come.

1671
01:32:50,200 --> 01:32:51,520
This is my uncle Venu.

1672
01:32:51,520 --> 01:32:52,440
Hi, uncle.

1673
01:32:52,560 --> 01:32:55,160
Some of the poems from
our philosophy came from him.

1674
01:32:55,440 --> 01:32:58,200
Uncle, then you should
definitely attend our Solo meeting.

1675
01:32:58,360 --> 01:33:00,280
How come? He is a changed man now.

1676
01:33:00,280 --> 01:33:01,200
He is changed?

1677
01:33:01,360 --> 01:33:01,960
Yeah.

1678
01:33:01,960 --> 01:33:03,320
Sudha auntie makes really good coffee.

1679
01:33:05,520 --> 01:33:08,240
I am also not bad at it, okay?

1680
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:09,360
Sit down.

1681
01:33:11,640 --> 01:33:14,560
Hey, did not you tell her yet?

1682
01:33:14,560 --> 01:33:15,560
How could I?

1683
01:33:15,560 --> 01:33:16,760
If I tell her that.

1684
01:33:16,760 --> 01:33:18,520
You cannot imagine the terror that follows.

1685
01:33:18,600 --> 01:33:19,960
Should I cover for you then?

1686
01:33:20,040 --> 01:33:21,760
Please do not say anything.

1687
01:33:21,760 --> 01:33:24,200
I am working it out from my end.
Go make coffee. That is enough.

1688
01:33:24,400 --> 01:33:25,680
You think so?
Yes.

1689
01:33:27,960 --> 01:33:31,800
I had a slip of tongue earlier.
Pardon me, huh.

1690
01:33:34,680 --> 01:33:35,880
Uncle, your coffee is just amazing.

1691
01:33:36,240 --> 01:33:37,000
Thank you!

1692
01:33:38,800 --> 01:33:40,400
Uncle, you also get
ready. We will go together.

1693
01:33:40,400 --> 01:33:42,600
Why me? You guys carry on.

1694
01:33:43,640 --> 01:33:44,360
Come on, let us go.

1695
01:33:44,400 --> 01:33:46,960
Hold on. She just said my coffee was good.
Let her finish it.

1696
01:33:47,080 --> 01:33:48,640
Do not rush her.

1697
01:33:50,560 --> 01:33:51,680
Amrutha, listen.

1698
01:33:51,800 --> 01:33:52,560
Yes, uncle?

1699
01:33:52,640 --> 01:33:55,960
No vehicle runs properly
without a minimum of 2 wheels.

1700
01:33:55,960 --> 01:33:56,120
No vehicle runs properly
without a minimum of 2 wheels.

1701
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,320
Ships and boats are doing
just fine with zero wheels, uncle.

1702
01:33:59,320 --> 01:34:00,840
Sir, that is poem no. 72, right?

1703
01:34:01,480 --> 01:34:02,960
You are so sharp!

1704
01:34:03,440 --> 01:34:04,280
Let us go?

1705
01:34:04,440 --> 01:34:05,760
Bye, uncle.
Bye dear.

1706
01:34:06,360 --> 01:34:07,440
See that?

1707
01:34:15,120 --> 01:34:17,880
Your uncle tried to tell me something.

1708
01:34:17,920 --> 01:34:20,160
It is nothing really. Forget about it.

1709
01:34:20,480 --> 01:34:21,120
Okay.

1710
01:34:21,640 --> 01:34:23,840
Shit! Shit! Shit!

1711
01:34:26,320 --> 01:34:27,640
He told me it’s an art exhibition.

1712
01:34:27,680 --> 01:34:29,120
Mentioned nothing about the Titanic theme.

1713
01:34:29,400 --> 01:34:30,960
Let us go back.

1714
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:34,080
Sir! Sir! We are here now.

1715
01:34:34,080 --> 01:34:35,000
Let us take a look and leave.

1716
01:34:35,400 --> 01:34:37,800
I am staying only because you want to.

1717
01:34:40,240 --> 01:34:41,360
These are all my creations.

1718
01:34:41,360 --> 01:34:43,160
Hey, idiot! Do not press whatever you want.

1719
01:34:43,200 --> 01:34:44,840
They will be here any minute now.
They are coming. Hold on.

1720
01:34:44,840 --> 01:34:47,160
Come. Come. I will show you.

1721
01:34:49,840 --> 01:34:54,000
Hey! Why did not you tell
me the theme was Titanic?

1722
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:55,600
Amrutha left. Thank god!

1723
01:34:55,800 --> 01:34:56,440
All set?

1724
01:34:56,440 --> 01:34:57,240
All set, bro.

1725
01:34:57,240 --> 01:35:00,600
Your plan will make Amrutha feel
from her heart instead of the brain.

1726
01:35:05,440 --> 01:35:07,960
Stop making stupid faces
and turn on the music.

1727
01:35:09,920 --> 01:35:12,920
This is where Jack and
Rose have seen each other.

1728
01:35:12,920 --> 01:35:14,360
For the first time.
On the ship.

1729
01:35:16,800 --> 01:35:19,480
See? Jack and Rose look crazy together.

1730
01:35:19,480 --> 01:35:20,600
It’s an art by me!

1731
01:35:21,200 --> 01:35:23,320
Well done, FF Hussain. Come. Come.

1732
01:35:23,400 --> 01:35:25,080
I will show you one more masterpiece.

1733
01:35:27,120 --> 01:35:30,480
This is where Jack and
Rose loved each other.

1734
01:35:31,280 --> 01:35:32,000
See the depth?

1735
01:35:32,440 --> 01:35:33,360
Not the sea depth.

1736
01:35:33,480 --> 01:35:35,000
See the depth of my heart.

1737
01:35:35,800 --> 01:35:37,560
Oh, man! Do not you look at the ship.

1738
01:35:37,920 --> 01:35:40,520
Please look at Jack
and Roses relationship.

1739
01:35:40,560 --> 01:35:41,600
That is the main thing.

1740
01:35:43,280 --> 01:35:44,160
Come. Come. Come.

1741
01:35:48,120 --> 01:35:51,200
This is where Jack and Rose made love.

1742
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
Hey, bald head. It is not a bold story.

1743
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:57,640
It is a great love story.

1744
01:35:58,960 --> 01:36:01,520
Hey, young lady! Why are you so curious?

1745
01:36:01,840 --> 01:36:03,040
Do you like this love story?

1746
01:36:04,440 --> 01:36:05,840
This is not a love story.

1747
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:07,400
What do you mean?

1748
01:36:08,360 --> 01:36:10,080
This is a Nature’s revenge story.

1749
01:36:10,840 --> 01:36:11,520
Revenge?

1750
01:36:11,560 --> 01:36:13,440
Whoa! How is that?

1751
01:36:13,440 --> 01:36:14,640
Tell me. No, tell me.

1752
01:36:15,320 --> 01:36:17,960
Listen. According to poem 62.

1753
01:36:17,960 --> 01:36:18,080
Listen. According to poem 62.

1754
01:36:18,080 --> 01:36:18,840
Poem?

1755
01:36:19,080 --> 01:36:20,960
Sir, explain them clearly.

1756
01:36:20,960 --> 01:36:22,000
Why me?

1757
01:36:22,080 --> 01:36:24,480
You are in a good flow. Go with it.

1758
01:36:24,880 --> 01:36:25,720
Okay, sir.

1759
01:36:26,680 --> 01:36:29,160
In the first painting, when the two meet.

1760
01:36:29,160 --> 01:36:33,040
Sky gave a signal through
lightening that they should not talk.

1761
01:36:36,680 --> 01:36:37,480
Really?

1762
01:36:37,680 --> 01:36:38,160
Yeah.

1763
01:36:38,480 --> 01:36:41,280
In the second painting, when he proposes.

1764
01:36:41,320 --> 01:36:44,520
A big wave signaled them
no by rising up and high.

1765
01:36:44,560 --> 01:36:45,200
Seriously?

1766
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:48,240
Whoa!

1767
01:36:48,360 --> 01:36:49,720
When they were making love.

1768
01:36:49,720 --> 01:36:54,640
The iceberg signaled them not to do it.

1769
01:37:01,680 --> 01:37:04,240
According to this and what my sir said.

1770
01:37:04,240 --> 01:37:07,560
Every time a guy and a
girl get into a relationship.

1771
01:37:07,600 --> 01:37:10,400
Nature sends them some signal against it.

1772
01:37:10,760 --> 01:37:13,240
Do you know what happens
when you ignore the signal?

1773
01:37:14,280 --> 01:37:16,200
What?
-I will show you.

1774
01:37:16,200 --> 01:37:16,280
What?
-I will show you.

1775
01:37:18,440 --> 01:37:18,920
Come.

1776
01:37:23,480 --> 01:37:25,680
This is the destruction that will happen.

1777
01:37:29,640 --> 01:37:32,440
That is why this is a
Natures revenge story.

1778
01:37:33,880 --> 01:37:35,040
Useless fellow!

1779
01:37:40,520 --> 01:37:43,200
I did not know my painting
meant such extreme things.

1780
01:37:45,040 --> 01:37:46,080
Breaking news!

1781
01:37:46,120 --> 01:37:49,720
Devotees smash their leader for
preaching a philosophy he does not follow.

1782
01:37:50,760 --> 01:37:52,240
I want nothing to do with this.

1783
01:37:55,800 --> 01:37:56,720
Hello, Amrutha. Tell me.

1784
01:37:56,720 --> 01:38:01,400
Hello, sir. We admitted mom
in the hospital this afternoon.

1785
01:38:01,400 --> 01:38:02,240
Which hospital?

1786
01:38:17,360 --> 01:38:18,200
What happened?

1787
01:38:18,640 --> 01:38:20,320
Mom had a heart stroke.

1788
01:38:20,640 --> 01:38:21,880
She is getting a stent.

1789
01:38:42,800 --> 01:38:44,880
She will be fine. Do not worry.

1790
01:38:49,440 --> 01:38:50,080
Doctor?

1791
01:38:50,120 --> 01:38:51,840
It could have been critical.

1792
01:38:52,080 --> 01:38:53,760
We did an angiogram and inserted a stent.

1793
01:38:53,840 --> 01:38:55,400
You can see her in the morning.

1794
01:38:55,720 --> 01:38:56,760
Okay, doctor.

1795
01:38:57,880 --> 01:39:00,040
How many times have I
told you let us go to the doctor?

1796
01:39:00,160 --> 01:39:00,920
You never listen!

1797
01:39:01,880 --> 01:39:03,520
Now see. You are in pain.

1798
01:39:04,240 --> 01:39:05,880
What would we do without you?

1799
01:39:06,600 --> 01:39:10,800
Ah, come on, dad!
I can not watch your melodrama anymore.

1800
01:39:11,120 --> 01:39:12,360
She is fine, right?

1801
01:39:13,880 --> 01:39:15,400
Doctors will take care of her.

1802
01:39:16,280 --> 01:39:17,360
You do not worry.

1803
01:39:24,400 --> 01:39:27,000
I got really worried
when this happened, sir.

1804
01:39:27,760 --> 01:39:29,120
What if something happened to her?

1805
01:39:29,280 --> 01:39:30,920
I would have had to
postpone my Australia plan.

1806
01:39:30,920 --> 01:39:31,240
I would have had to
postpone my Australia plan.

1807
01:39:32,320 --> 01:39:33,360
What Australia plan?

1808
01:39:33,880 --> 01:39:35,320
Oh, I did not tell you.

1809
01:39:35,480 --> 01:39:37,080
I am going to Australia in 10 days.

1810
01:39:37,240 --> 01:39:38,640
I did not tell my parents either.

1811
01:39:39,640 --> 01:39:40,840
Why all of a sudden?

1812
01:39:41,400 --> 01:39:45,160
They will start all that emotional
drama about marriage in some days.

1813
01:39:45,200 --> 01:39:47,480
You are good, sir. You will convince anybody.

1814
01:39:47,480 --> 01:39:48,920
I cannot do that.

1815
01:39:48,920 --> 01:39:50,920
That is why I have decided
to go far from them.

1816
01:39:54,680 --> 01:39:56,760
Get a squeeze of lemon.

1817
01:39:59,480 --> 01:40:01,160
Why is he dull, man?

1818
01:40:01,200 --> 01:40:03,040
Amruthas leaving to Australia.

1819
01:40:06,280 --> 01:40:07,240
So what now?

1820
01:40:07,320 --> 01:40:08,080
I do not know.

1821
01:40:10,200 --> 01:40:12,200
That bloody book! I am going to rip it off.

1822
01:40:12,200 --> 01:40:13,840
Those poems are screwing with my head.

1823
01:40:41,800 --> 01:40:45,640
Life has turned dark for the
person who invented the bulb.

1824
01:40:45,680 --> 01:40:49,560
Sim card has been blocked for the
tele communications owner itself.

1825
01:40:49,680 --> 01:40:53,640
Google maps has forgot
it’s way back to home.

1826
01:40:53,720 --> 01:40:57,720
Bad time has started for the
watch which shows us the right time.

1827
01:40:57,760 --> 01:41:05,680
I have just lit the match stick
and the whole house caught fire.

1828
01:41:05,800 --> 01:41:13,760
I words i have told in the past life
are now effecting my bright future.

1829
01:41:13,840 --> 01:41:15,600
Do not leave me Amrutha.

1830
01:41:15,600 --> 01:41:17,680
I will become a drunkard

1831
01:41:17,800 --> 01:41:21,760
I swear, I will become lonely
if you leave me and go.

1832
01:41:21,840 --> 01:41:23,520
Do not leave me Amrutha.

1833
01:41:23,520 --> 01:41:25,640
I will become a drunkard.

1834
01:41:25,800 --> 01:41:29,880
I swear, I will become lonely
if you leave me and go.

1835
01:41:46,640 --> 01:41:47,200
Let us go.

1836
01:41:47,360 --> 01:41:48,240
Hey Stop Stop.

1837
01:41:49,120 --> 01:41:50,120
Let us go to the University, sir.

1838
01:41:50,200 --> 01:41:50,680
Why?

1839
01:41:50,680 --> 01:41:52,000
I have to look over the
meeting arrangements.

1840
01:42:17,920 --> 01:42:21,800
You are not a kid to
console you with a chocolate.

1841
01:42:21,920 --> 01:42:25,800
You are so strong like
gum and you torture me.

1842
01:42:25,920 --> 01:42:29,840
I can not slap you, even if I want to.

1843
01:42:29,960 --> 01:42:32,960
You will kill me, if I want
to hug you say this.

1844
01:42:32,960 --> 01:42:33,920
You will kill me, if I want
to hug you say this.

1845
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:40,040
Do not be like a stone?
If you think with your heart,

1846
01:42:40,040 --> 01:42:41,680
You will change your decision.

1847
01:42:41,680 --> 01:42:46,000
Open the gate of your
heart and peep into it.

1848
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:49,840
You can find me, because you love me.

1849
01:42:49,920 --> 01:42:53,920
Do not leave me Amrutha
I’ll become a drunkard.

1850
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:57,960
I swear,
I will become lonely if you leave me and go.

1851
01:42:58,040 --> 01:43:01,920
Do not leave me Amrutha
I will become a drunkard

1852
01:43:02,040 --> 01:43:06,120
I swear,
I will become lonely if you leave me and go.

1853
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:22,560
Let us collect the passport
and flight tickets and go.

1854
01:43:24,080 --> 01:43:25,720
Sir, you also come with me.

1855
01:43:25,800 --> 01:43:27,640
You go. I will wait outside.

1856
01:43:27,880 --> 01:43:28,960
Okay. I will just come.

1857
01:43:42,560 --> 01:43:43,280
Sir, let us go.

1858
01:43:51,640 --> 01:43:53,720
You come so close to me.

1859
01:43:54,280 --> 01:43:57,280
Before I scream and ask
you to stay, you go far away.

1860
01:43:59,600 --> 01:44:01,520
Why do not you stay? Please!

1861
01:44:04,680 --> 01:44:06,120
You know how this feels like?

1862
01:44:06,640 --> 01:44:09,680
It is like giving a boon and then
immediately cursing the person.

1863
01:44:12,120 --> 01:44:13,680
What are you saying, sir?

1864
01:44:17,360 --> 01:44:21,960
I am saying this with the
experience of travelling solo in life.

1865
01:44:22,560 --> 01:44:25,800
When you are travelling alone, even
the smallest distance feels the farthest.

1866
01:44:25,800 --> 01:44:28,640
When you are with someone, even
the longest distance feels the closest.

1867
01:44:31,200 --> 01:44:34,440
The happiness I never
had in these 30 years.

1868
01:44:34,440 --> 01:44:36,480
You gave me that in just
the last couple of days.

1869
01:44:36,800 --> 01:44:40,320
Why do not you let this happiness
remain for a lifetime, Amrutha?

1870
01:44:43,480 --> 01:44:45,480
I want to marry you, Amrutha.

1871
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:47,000
Stop it, sir!

1872
01:44:49,840 --> 01:44:54,240
I have believed in your
philosophy like it is the Vedas.

1873
01:44:54,640 --> 01:44:56,120
How can you say this now?

1874
01:44:56,760 --> 01:44:57,480
No, listen.

1875
01:44:57,480 --> 01:44:59,280
So you have been manipulating
us all these years.

1876
01:44:59,280 --> 01:45:00,880
Pretending these last few days.

1877
01:45:00,880 --> 01:45:02,240
And cheating us this whole time.

1878
01:45:03,320 --> 01:45:04,360
You are a cheater!

1879
01:45:05,600 --> 01:45:08,040
Never show me your face again. Please!

1880
01:45:09,240 --> 01:45:09,920
Amrutha!

1881
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:15,440
Sir!

1882
01:45:16,280 --> 01:45:16,800
Let us go?
It is done.

1883
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:17,640
Let us go?
It is done.

1884
01:45:29,400 --> 01:45:30,040
Bye sir.

1885
01:45:31,840 --> 01:45:34,120
Sir! I got my VISA.

1886
01:45:34,240 --> 01:45:35,800
I will leave once the meeting is done.

1887
01:45:36,240 --> 01:45:37,840
Everything will go smoothly, right?

1888
01:45:38,280 --> 01:45:38,920
Hmm.

1889
01:45:38,920 --> 01:45:40,000
Thank you, sir. Bye!

1890
01:45:53,640 --> 01:45:55,240
Virat! Virat!

1891
01:45:55,720 --> 01:45:56,960
Wake up.
What is it, dad?

1892
01:45:57,440 --> 01:45:58,360
What happened?

1893
01:45:58,360 --> 01:46:00,120
I will tell you. Come with me.

1894
01:47:19,440 --> 01:47:23,160
Loneliness has been waging
a war at me every night.

1895
01:47:23,920 --> 01:47:26,120
I have been fighting it with courage.

1896
01:47:26,480 --> 01:47:27,520
But last night.

1897
01:47:28,240 --> 01:47:30,760
My courage lost to loneliness.

1898
01:47:31,840 --> 01:47:33,960
You might think that I am okay.

1899
01:47:34,760 --> 01:47:36,200
But I am not at all fine.

1900
01:47:36,960 --> 01:47:38,520
I do not mean to hurt you.

1901
01:47:39,560 --> 01:47:42,840
It is just that I can not live like this.
So I am dying.

1902
01:47:44,160 --> 01:47:44,880
Forgive me.

1903
01:47:46,040 --> 01:47:49,400
Solo life is a soulless life.

1904
01:48:42,400 --> 01:48:44,920
Hey, Virat! Solo Life Is So Better!

1905
01:48:45,240 --> 01:48:47,320
Sometimes to wipe our tears.

1906
01:48:47,320 --> 01:48:48,840
Even both the hands
do not seem to be enough.

1907
01:48:48,840 --> 01:48:50,840
You are my God in disguise, sir.

1908
01:48:51,040 --> 01:48:53,680
I promise you that I will change your
daughters opinion and marry her.

1909
01:48:53,720 --> 01:48:55,480
I am leaving to Australia in 10 days.

1910
01:49:08,320 --> 01:49:12,120
After watching uncle take his life
because he couldn’t bear the loneliness.

1911
01:49:14,560 --> 01:49:15,600
I am scared.

1912
01:49:17,320 --> 01:49:21,280
I understand what a big mistake I have done.

1913
01:49:24,960 --> 01:49:26,680
What hurts me is.

1914
01:49:26,720 --> 01:49:30,160
I could make so many people
believe that love and marriage hurt you.

1915
01:49:30,880 --> 01:49:35,600
But I am unable to convince one girl that
love and marriage are a good thing. Damn it!

1916
01:49:37,600 --> 01:49:38,880
Amruthas crazy, mom.

1917
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:42,680
She took me for my words and decided to go to
Australia to distance herself from everybody.

1918
01:49:43,960 --> 01:49:46,120
I do not get how I can convince her.

1919
01:49:46,600 --> 01:49:49,400
She will understand when you tell
her that your opinion has changed.

1920
01:49:54,120 --> 01:49:56,200
They say it is okay to lie to any
extent to make a marriage happen.

1921
01:49:56,280 --> 01:49:59,600
But nobody wonders What if one of
those lies made the marriage crumble?

1922
01:50:00,840 --> 01:50:03,720
Because you believed your
philosophy was right back then.

1923
01:50:03,720 --> 01:50:04,800
You advocated it strongly.

1924
01:50:05,440 --> 01:50:08,240
Now when you believe that is wrong,
much strongly than before.

1925
01:50:08,400 --> 01:50:09,840
Why are you hesitating?

1926
01:50:11,240 --> 01:50:12,640
Go tell her.

1927
01:50:17,200 --> 01:50:18,440
You are right, dad.

1928
01:50:24,720 --> 01:50:25,280
Hello.

1929
01:50:26,120 --> 01:50:26,840
Amrutha.

1930
01:50:26,960 --> 01:50:28,520
I need to see you urgently.

1931
01:50:28,840 --> 01:50:30,200
Can you come to Kailasagiri?

1932
01:50:30,280 --> 01:50:31,920
Sure, sir. I will be there.

1933
01:50:32,160 --> 01:50:33,360
Okay. Bye.

1934
01:50:38,440 --> 01:50:40,040
Hello. Where are you?

1935
01:50:40,080 --> 01:50:41,240
Hello, dude.

1936
01:50:42,080 --> 01:50:43,200
Who are you, bro?

1937
01:50:43,400 --> 01:50:45,640
Ravan from Lanka.

1938
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:47,400
What are you doing on the phone?

1939
01:50:47,560 --> 01:50:53,000
You only told me that the right time to
kidnap Sita is when Rama is not around.

1940
01:50:53,720 --> 01:50:54,520
I took her.

1941
01:50:54,640 --> 01:50:58,720
Dude, you do not need
Hanuman to find out the location.

1942
01:50:58,840 --> 01:51:00,800
I am at the port area.

1943
01:51:01,080 --> 01:51:02,360
Come and get Sita.

1944
01:51:02,640 --> 01:51:05,360
Then I will agree that you are Lord Rama.

1945
01:51:29,360 --> 01:51:30,600
Dude!

1946
01:51:35,200 --> 01:51:38,720
You knocked me down last
time because I was short of soldiers.

1947
01:51:38,840 --> 01:51:41,960
This time, I am here
with an entire battalion.

1948
01:51:43,280 --> 01:51:44,800
Well prepared!

1949
01:51:45,880 --> 01:51:47,280
This is Kumbhakarna.

1950
01:51:47,280 --> 01:51:48,680
This is Indrajit.

1951
01:51:49,880 --> 01:51:51,800
I dare you to beat them now and take her.

1952
01:51:52,880 --> 01:51:54,120
Take her!

1953
01:51:54,240 --> 01:51:55,040
Go!

1954
01:52:52,160 --> 01:52:53,520
Ten heads have been smashed.

1955
01:52:54,240 --> 01:52:55,360
What about you?

1956
01:52:56,160 --> 01:52:57,320
You only tell me, dude.

1957
01:52:57,560 --> 01:53:01,080
Be it Lanka or the port.

1958
01:53:01,360 --> 01:53:03,360
Lord Rama prevails in the end.

1959
01:53:03,440 --> 01:53:05,960
Dude, you are Rama. That is final.

1960
01:53:06,480 --> 01:53:07,320
Can I go now?

1961
01:53:07,560 --> 01:53:08,040
Hmm.

1962
01:53:09,200 --> 01:53:10,800
Dude gave me absolute clarity yet again.

1963
01:53:10,800 --> 01:53:11,800
Let’s get out of here.

1964
01:53:11,840 --> 01:53:13,360
What about Sita?

1965
01:53:17,600 --> 01:53:19,840
Some guy calls himself Ravan
and argues it immediately.

1966
01:53:19,840 --> 01:53:22,200
Everybody calls you Rama.
But you do not get it.

1967
01:53:22,680 --> 01:53:23,880
What are you saying?

1968
01:53:23,880 --> 01:53:27,200
I wanted to meet you to talk
about something important.

1969
01:53:27,360 --> 01:53:29,000
Actually, I only wanted to talk to you.

1970
01:53:30,240 --> 01:53:32,920
You should know what
happened before you called.

1971
01:53:32,960 --> 01:53:34,320
Get everything ready, okay?

1972
01:53:34,320 --> 01:53:34,920
Okay, bye.

1973
01:53:35,960 --> 01:53:39,920
Amrutha. Bank Manager called.

1974
01:53:41,080 --> 01:53:43,240
We do not have to go for a loan for money.

1975
01:53:44,160 --> 01:53:45,640
Tell me how much you need.

1976
01:53:45,680 --> 01:53:47,160
I will arrange it for you.

1977
01:53:47,480 --> 01:53:48,800
Dad, why?

1978
01:53:48,880 --> 01:53:50,600
I will not trouble you anymore, Amrutha.

1979
01:53:52,080 --> 01:53:53,400
Do whatever you want.

1980
01:53:53,960 --> 01:53:59,320
But, do not forget that you are
all that me and your mothers got.

1981
01:54:03,400 --> 01:54:06,280
Poor guy! I feel sorry for him.

1982
01:54:06,360 --> 01:54:08,600
There is nothing going on between us, dad.

1983
01:54:08,760 --> 01:54:12,000
He strictly condemns
relationships and emotions.

1984
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:12,120
He strictly condemns
relationships and emotions.

1985
01:54:15,200 --> 01:54:17,800
If there is nothing going
on between you two.

1986
01:54:17,840 --> 01:54:21,240
Why did you call him when
you have so many friends?

1987
01:54:22,480 --> 01:54:24,480
If he had no emotions.

1988
01:54:24,480 --> 01:54:27,520
Why did he spend the entire
night here with us like family?

1989
01:54:31,160 --> 01:54:33,960
Do you know why I was so
worried about your mother?

1990
01:54:35,600 --> 01:54:39,520
Because only I know how my
life is going to be without her.

1991
01:54:42,960 --> 01:54:45,320
All this might sound like melodrama to you.

1992
01:54:45,960 --> 01:54:48,600
But when he is no more by your side.

1993
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,040
You will feel the lack of his presence.

1994
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:05,280
If only Lord Rama was
with Goddess Sita that day.

1995
01:55:05,280 --> 01:55:06,600
Goddess Sita wouldn’t
have to go through so much.

1996
01:55:06,600 --> 01:55:08,280
Goddess Sita wouldn’t
have to go through so much.

1997
01:55:15,600 --> 01:55:18,920
You are always around,
whenever I am in a tough situation.

1998
01:55:19,720 --> 01:55:22,240
Solo life is soul less life.

1999
01:55:27,680 --> 01:55:28,320
Oh.

2000
01:55:30,040 --> 01:55:32,200
There is great love between us, sir.

2001
01:55:32,440 --> 01:55:33,560
Listen, Amrutha.

2002
01:55:33,600 --> 01:55:35,040
According to poem no. 65.

2003
01:55:35,040 --> 01:55:37,240
Enough of your poems, sir.

2004
01:55:37,720 --> 01:55:39,360
I am telling you it is all crap.

2005
01:55:39,360 --> 01:55:40,240
Yes. It is wrong.

2006
01:55:40,240 --> 01:55:44,080
Turn your brain off for once
and think with your heart.

2007
01:55:46,400 --> 01:55:47,880
Please. You will understand.

2008
01:55:47,880 --> 01:55:50,840
No, Amrutha. According to
my philosophy, Solo Life.

2009
01:56:06,880 --> 01:56:10,560
I will tell you something if
you promise not to let go.

2010
01:56:10,760 --> 01:56:11,240
Hmm?

2011
01:56:11,440 --> 01:56:14,920
I already knew that my
philosophy was trash.

2012
01:56:15,600 --> 01:56:19,240
Hey. Do not let go. Hold tight. Tighter.

2013
01:56:21,280 --> 01:56:22,640
It is not just about love.

2014
01:56:22,640 --> 01:56:24,560
When you are honest in your approach.

2015
01:56:24,600 --> 01:56:27,840
Even Nature favors you automatically.

2016
01:56:29,400 --> 01:56:30,360
Sir! We are good now.

2017
01:56:30,360 --> 01:56:31,440
Sir! We are good now.

2018
01:56:31,440 --> 01:56:33,080
But, what about our members?

2019
01:56:33,080 --> 01:56:36,120
We want
Justice!

2020
01:56:42,880 --> 01:56:44,320
Poem no. 44.

2021
01:56:44,400 --> 01:56:47,960
You only told us not to give
anyone the consent to hurt us.

2022
01:56:48,560 --> 01:56:50,720
But just because everything is
going well for you, you hit on a girl.

2023
01:56:51,280 --> 01:56:53,880
You know how difficult that is?
Hitting on a girl.

2024
01:56:56,120 --> 01:56:57,600
Okay. Calm down.

2025
01:56:58,120 --> 01:57:01,320
Dude, listen to me. Try to understand.

2026
01:57:01,880 --> 01:57:04,880
We feel sad when the hero and heroine
are not together by climax in a movie.

2027
01:57:04,960 --> 01:57:07,840
But if there’s no guy or
girl in your life in reality.

2028
01:57:07,840 --> 01:57:09,200
You do not have to let others hurt you.

2029
01:57:09,200 --> 01:57:10,480
You will hurt yourself.

2030
01:57:10,560 --> 01:57:11,840
Poem no. 35.

2031
01:57:12,320 --> 01:57:13,920
Law of Nature.

2032
01:57:13,920 --> 01:57:16,400
I am coming to that point. Law of Nature!

2033
01:57:16,400 --> 01:57:17,680
What did Murthy bro say
in the interview that day?

2034
01:57:17,680 --> 01:57:17,920
What did Murthy bro say
in the interview that day?

2035
01:57:18,080 --> 01:57:21,080
Two birds. Two snakes. All the
creatures are abiding by the Law of Nature.

2036
01:57:21,320 --> 01:57:23,840
We humans should do too.
We should get married.

2037
01:57:23,840 --> 01:57:24,960
Solo Life Is So Better, sir.

2038
01:57:24,960 --> 01:57:28,560
Yes! So better! So better!
But until when? What is your age?

2039
01:57:28,840 --> 01:57:30,400
I will be 20 soon.

2040
01:57:30,400 --> 01:57:32,040
That is the problem.

2041
01:57:32,280 --> 01:57:36,400
Once you are 30, do you know
how it feels to be called an uncle?

2042
01:57:37,480 --> 01:57:41,600
How it feels when an auntie,
much older than you, proposes marriage.

2043
01:57:42,520 --> 01:57:45,440
How it feels when you realize
your own philosophy is wrong.

2044
01:57:46,400 --> 01:57:49,280
Listen, kid.
I am saying this from my own experience.

2045
01:57:49,280 --> 01:57:52,760
Trust me. Solo Life Is Not So Better.
It is So Boring.

2046
01:57:52,920 --> 01:57:54,640
What? You do not believe me?

2047
01:57:54,800 --> 01:57:55,280
Alright then.

2048
01:57:55,360 --> 01:58:01,960
I will write another compilation of 108 poems on why
you should love and why you should get ma

2049
01:58:01,960 --> 01:58:03,200
Would that convince you?

2050
01:58:04,600 --> 01:58:05,600
When will you write it, sir?

2051
01:58:09,120 --> 01:58:10,120
Sir, I have a doubt.

2052
01:58:10,720 --> 01:58:13,280
There is no decor or relatives.

2053
01:58:13,440 --> 01:58:14,440
When are you getting married, sir?

2054
01:58:14,840 --> 01:58:16,200
When am I getting married?
Yes sir.

2055
01:58:22,880 --> 01:58:25,760
Bro, really, really thanks.

2056
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:27,840
You have got me a great alliance.

2057
01:58:30,960 --> 01:58:36,400
Sister-in-law is average.
My wife is smoking hot.

2058
01:58:38,520 --> 01:58:41,840
Hey! I have watched Srinivasa
Kalyanam movie once again.

2059
01:58:41,920 --> 01:58:43,920
You have missed a chant somewhere.

2060
01:58:43,960 --> 01:58:44,560
Say it.

2061
01:58:45,280 --> 01:58:47,760
That is right. Say it loudly.

2062
01:58:47,880 --> 01:58:49,000
He forgot!

2063
01:58:49,280 --> 01:58:51,800
Govind! You are really a pain.
