 I am worried about

94
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:31,708

95
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:33,166

It's the servants duty to touches his master's feet, Munna

00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,375
 Oh so now it's about duties

112

Do you want me to put my weight on these carriers?

133

00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:34,375
The carriers do not take care of anything

140
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:38,666
 I will clean it right away

141
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:43,000

Greetings father - Live long son

152
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:15,166
Weren't you supposed to come last evening?

153
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:16,083
 Were you stranded somewhere?

154
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:17,833
 Yes..I was coming here

155
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:20,416
but I came to know that D'souza Sir...is ill..

156
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:22,041

Dinesh D'souza? - Yes

158
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,958
 He is in a very bad state

159
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:27,916
 It's all because of his deeds

160
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:28,833
 He himself is responsible

161
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:32,791
But father...he wasn't wrong in getting married to a child-widow

162
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:36,583
 What else? He married a widow

163
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:39,208
He quit his religion.. and embraced some other religion

164
00:09:39,708 --> 00:09:40,541
 What could be more sinful?

165
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:41,833
 Is this a sin?

166
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:45,791
Look son...we are the high-caste Brahmins..

167
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:47,500
..we should not be associated with them

168
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,583
 Please don't go there..hereafter

00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:49,625

You say..is it three or five? - Five

186
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:15,750
Tell me quickly... - Alright down

187
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:19,416
you lose..five 1...2...3...4..5

188
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:20,958
 I will not play with you

189
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:23,291
 Don't bother..you cry when you lose

190
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:25,000
I won't talk - Alright

191
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,208
 To can go walking from tomorrow

192
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:28,916
 I will not take you in my carriage

193
00:11:29,416 --> 00:11:32,708
You thought of our childhood, didn't you?

194
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:36,458
 Nothing goes away..Asha

195
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:40,458
 ... but things change

196
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:42,750
 That is right

197
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:45,708
What were you thinking.. sitting here alone?

198
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:49,791
Father fell asleep.. and so I came here

199
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:56,000
I come here..when.. I am too worried

200
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,041
 Come...let me take you out

201
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:01,541
You will be in trouble, if anyone sees you with me

202
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:04,500
Why? - I am a Christian Deepak

203
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,791
But you are still the same Asha to me... Come

204
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:09,000
 No let it be

205
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:13,125
 Come or remember five beatings?

206
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:17,125
 Common... get up

207
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:39,625
 "New travelers... on a new path"

208
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:46,958
 "New travelers... on a new path"

209
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:50,625
"You haven't changed.. neither have I"

210
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:54,208
 "...but everything else has changed"

211
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:58,208
 "New travelers... on a new path"

212
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:23,708
"The memories of childhood... is like the mark on a rock"

213
00:13:34,791 --> 00:13:41,583
"The memories of childhood... is like the mark on a rock"

214
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:48,541
"I haven't seen the first love disappear from hearts so easily"

215
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:56,166
"The storms of times couldn't blow off these lamps"

216
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:59,916
"You haven't changed.. neither have I"

217
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:03,458
 "...but everything else has changed"

218
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:07,458
 "New travelers... on a new path"

219
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:36,375
"Something that changes with time, isn't called love"

220
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:54,250
"Something that changes with time, isn't called love"

221
00:14:54,750 --> 00:15:01,250
"The one who turns his back isn't called a friend"

222
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:08,791
"A friend is one who stay with us in our sorrows"

223
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:12,458
"You haven't changed.. neither have I"

224
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:16,000
 "...but everything else has changed"

225
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:23,291
 "New travelers... on a new path"

226
00:15:23,791 --> 00:15:26,958
"You haven't changed.. neither have I"

227
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:30,541
 "...but everything else has changed"

228
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:34,541
 "New travelers... on a new path"

229
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,375
 I am on my way God

230
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:56,000
 Lord Krishna I am on my way

231
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,666
Where are you going? What happened to you?

232
00:15:59,166 --> 00:15:59,791
Leave me - Father

233
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:01,416
Leave me - Sir

234
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:02,208
 Deepak

235
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:03,583
 I want to go to my God

236
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:05,416
I want to go to Lord Krishna

237
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:06,458
 What are you doing?

238
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:09,208
Please control yourself.. you should.. - No

239
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:10,541
You need rest - No

240
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:15,791
Sleep... lie down - No

241
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:19,166
What has happened? Deepak what has happened to father?

242
00:16:19,666 --> 00:16:22,625
Why is he behaving like this? - Dear...the world is very ruthless

243
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:24,666
 Father..- They didn't let me live

244
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:27,916
They will not let you live too - What are you saying Sir?

245
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:31,291
Asha will live... with all the respects

246
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:32,958
 I promise you

247
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:35,541
Did you hear that? I promise you

248
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:39,250
 What did you say?

249
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:42,208
You are making a promise? - Yes

250
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:43,541
 Did you hear that?

251
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:46,000
 the promise given by Deepak

252
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:50,125
 is the only thing I am leaving for you

253
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:54,375
 You have my blessing

254
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:58,375
 You should live happily

255
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:16,500
 Father...

256
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,500
 Father

257
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:32,750
 Father

258
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:37,625
Did you call for me, father? - Yes

259
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:42,000
Accountant..take this I will check it later

260
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,291
 Where were you last night?

261
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:46,750
 D'souza Sir..passed away last night

262
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:48,916
I was late...as I had to wait for his burial

263
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:51,875
Why?...were there no other people in this village?

264
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:54,416
...that you had to go for such a good deed

265
00:17:54,916 --> 00:17:56,500
 Didn't I ask you not to go there?

266
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,291
 Father...I am a Doctor too

267
00:17:58,791 --> 00:18:00,958
It's my duty to treat a sick man

268
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:03,750
 And so I cannot listen to you

269
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:07,833
You have done your duties as a Doctor

270
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:12,416
What answer do you have for whatever happened at the temple?

271
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:14,708
It was the last wish of a man on his death bed

272
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:16,791
that he visits the shrine of Lord Krishna

273
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:19,291
And... - You fulfilled his wish

274
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:22,500
Yes..I didn't do anything wrong father

275
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,041
The society decides the good and the bad...

276
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:26,666
 ..not me or you

277
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:28,875
Our society doesn't allow D'souza and his daughter...

278
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:30,500
 ..to enter the temple

279
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,458
 And so they cannot got to the temple

280
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:37,166
And still you created a chaos there...why? What for?

281
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:41,500
Father... no one is untouchable for me

282
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,750
 There isn't any caste difference

283
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:47,500
My duty is to serve a man and give him life

284
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,208
..I do not agree with you society, your thoughts

285
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:57,208
 Pardon me

286
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:16,083
 What is all this Asha?

287
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:21,541
The reason and support that I stayed here for has

288
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:24,541
I will taking the evening train.. - Where to?

289
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:28,041
 Anywhere...I do not know

290
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:29,833
 You must not be aware that...

291
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:33,625
..I promised something to Masterji's, right here

292
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:36,291
The promise that would change our lives upside down..

293
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:38,791
 ..what would we do with it, Deepak?

294
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:41,708
I release you from that promise - No Asha..

295
00:19:42,208 --> 00:19:44,416
...that promise will not change my life upside down..

296
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:46,000
 ..instead my life would be sorted

297
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,750
 I need you Asha

298
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:50,541
Listen...we will go far away from here

299
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:53,708
We will serve the poor, helpless and troubled people

300
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:55,041
 We will start an hospital

301
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:57,125
I have come with this dream to village

302
00:19:57,625 --> 00:20:00,208
I need your support to fulfill my dreams

303
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:03,500
Deepak - Tell me..will you support me?

304
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,916
Tell me Asha... will you support me?

305
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:11,916
 Deepak

306
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:30,958
Now the groom can put vermillion on the bride's forehead

307
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:34,583
 Stop

308
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:38,583
 Father..is that you?

309
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:44,541
You haven't done a good thing, Priest

310
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:46,708
 Bless your daughter-in-law

311
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:49,666
You haven't made me proud to bless you

312
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:51,625
I have to tell you something Come with me

313
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:54,916
Speak whatever you want to speak right here

314
00:20:55,416 --> 00:20:57,500
 Our family matters should only...

315
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:58,791
 ..be discussed in our house

316
00:20:59,291 --> 00:20:59,708
 Come

317
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:02,083
Come Asha - No

318
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:06,083
 I want to talk only to you

319
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:09,833
Priest I give you twenty-four hours... ...

320
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:13,833
 ... ..to leave this village

321
00:21:15,916 --> 00:21:18,375
Don't worry Asha... I will be back soon

322
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:22,750
 Please take care of her

323
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:24,250
 Don't worry sister-in-law

324
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,000
 He is the only son

325
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,750
Zamindar (Landlord) will be a little mad

326
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:30,791
 ...but he will be fine

327
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:33,125
 Do you see them?

328
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,500
 They are our ancestors...

329
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,500
 ..who brought pride to our family

330
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,083
I can proudly say..in the presence of these great men..

331
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:48,541
...that I have never done anything to disgrace them

332
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:50,958
 You are the only heir to this family

333
00:21:51,458 --> 00:21:52,583
 By whatever you have done today..

334
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:56,500
..not only me..you have disgraced all of them

335
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,625
But I had promised a man on his death bed

336
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:04,416
Why did you promise things... without a thought?

337
00:22:04,916 --> 00:22:06,541
 Anyways... nothing has changed yet

338
00:22:07,041 --> 00:22:08,208
 The witness of your wedding..

339
00:22:08,708 --> 00:22:10,333
 ..can still be asked to keep quiet

340
00:22:10,833 --> 00:22:14,041
 Send that girl to an orphanage

341
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:16,083
Give her any amount of money she wants

342
00:22:16,583 --> 00:22:20,500
 Father...Asha is now my wife

343
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:26,125
Do you think...whatever you are saying...is right?

344
00:22:26,625 --> 00:22:28,875
 I know it's wrong

345
00:22:29,375 --> 00:22:31,500
But you took a wrong decision first

346
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:32,833
 You are an high-caste Brahmin...

347
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:34,041
 ..and the girl is a Christian

348
00:22:34,541 --> 00:22:35,625
 She can never become your wife

349
00:22:36,125 --> 00:22:36,916
 Forget her, son

350
00:22:37,416 --> 00:22:39,000
 This isn't possible father

351
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:42,916
 I am helpless

352
00:22:43,416 --> 00:22:47,250
If you are helpless..then this family is also helpless

353
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:50,833
..and I am helpless..for the sake of the pride of our family

354
00:22:51,333 --> 00:22:53,458
Do you want me to disown you from all the rights to this family

355
00:22:53,958 --> 00:22:57,125
... just for the sake of Dinesh Chand's daughter?

356
00:22:57,625 --> 00:22:59,125
 Whatever you think is right...

357
00:22:59,625 --> 00:23:01,125
 I would agree to whatever you say

358
00:23:01,625 --> 00:23:04,375
I am leaving this village, along with Asha

359
00:23:04,875 --> 00:23:06,333
 Bless me, father..

360
00:23:06,833 --> 00:23:09,375
...so that I could serve the poor and the unfortunate - Let it be..

361
00:23:09,875 --> 00:23:11,500
 ...this isn't needed

362
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,458
Listen son... I am telling you for the last time

363
00:23:15,958 --> 00:23:17,500
Save this family from getting disgraced

364
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,166
You can repent for the mistake that you committed

365
00:23:19,666 --> 00:23:21,625
I don't think of it as a mistake, father

366
00:23:22,125 --> 00:23:25,333
Remember that...you will in no way be related to me

367
00:23:25,833 --> 00:23:27,708
 ..not to me..or to this family

368
00:23:28,208 --> 00:23:30,583
 The family that you are so proud of..

369
00:23:31,083 --> 00:23:33,666
... the heir of the same family promises you

370
00:23:34,166 --> 00:23:37,500
...that I will never misuse your name or the name of this family

371
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,416
 I will live an anonymous life

372
00:23:40,916 --> 00:23:44,083
I will not tell anyone that you are my father

373
00:23:44,583 --> 00:23:48,083
I give my last respects to you and my ancestors

374
00:23:48,583 --> 00:23:51,541
 Please accept it...if you can

375
00:23:52,041 --> 00:23:54,875
Please don't go...listen to me Munna

376
00:23:55,375 --> 00:23:57,125
 Sir...what a misconstrue!

377
00:23:57,625 --> 00:23:58,791
 He is the heir to this family

378
00:23:59,291 --> 00:24:01,291
 Please stop him, Sir

379
00:24:01,791 --> 00:24:03,541
 Let him go, Girdhari

380
00:24:04,041 --> 00:24:06,000
I would think that God hasn't given me any children

381
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:10,000
 Sir...please don't do that

382
00:24:13,791 --> 00:24:16,125
 What are you thinking, Asha?

383
00:24:16,625 --> 00:24:17,833
 I was thinking...

384
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:21,458
..we were travelling towards the village in an evening like this..

385
00:24:21,958 --> 00:24:24,416
...and today we are leaving the village

386
00:24:24,916 --> 00:24:27,375
No Asha...we are not leaving the village

387
00:24:27,875 --> 00:24:30,041
We are going towards a new world

388
00:24:30,541 --> 00:24:34,041
With my Asha...with new hopes ...Isn't it?

389
00:24:48,958 --> 00:24:50,958
 Chandramukhi..

390
00:24:51,458 --> 00:24:54,666
Here have these bananas... oranges

391
00:24:55,166 --> 00:24:56,041
 I have turned breathless...

392
00:24:56,541 --> 00:24:56,708
 ..looking for holy water

393
00:24:57,208 --> 00:25:00,666
 You can eat this..

394
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:02,791
 What is the matter, Sir?

395
00:25:03,291 --> 00:25:05,541
You are having tea..in front of the ladies compartment

396
00:25:06,041 --> 00:25:09,458
What are you trying to do? - Whatever you are

397
00:25:09,958 --> 00:25:12,333
Am I having tea...glancing at you and making a sound?

398
00:25:12,833 --> 00:25:16,333
 I am helpless

399
00:25:19,375 --> 00:25:20,541
 Bless you!

400
00:25:21,041 --> 00:25:23,750
I shouldn't have had tea standing here..

401
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:25,125
 ..but what can I do?

402
00:25:25,625 --> 00:25:30,083
I the one I am glancing at... is right here

403
00:25:30,583 --> 00:25:32,541
 Her?...I got it

404
00:25:33,041 --> 00:25:34,708
 I have been married for nine years

405
00:25:35,208 --> 00:25:35,958
 I have almost forgotten it

406
00:25:36,458 --> 00:25:38,375
I have been married for less than nine days..

407
00:25:38,875 --> 00:25:39,291
 ..and so I made the mistake

408
00:25:39,791 --> 00:25:41,625
 Bless you!..you can make any sound

409
00:25:42,125 --> 00:25:45,125
You are fun Do you play chess?

410
00:25:45,625 --> 00:25:46,250
 Yes...a little

411
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:47,791
 Then come into my compartment

412
00:25:48,291 --> 00:25:49,083
 let's have a game

413
00:25:49,583 --> 00:25:51,041
...will chat - Yes...common

414
00:25:51,541 --> 00:25:53,166
Chandramukhi..I am taking him to my compartment

415
00:25:53,666 --> 00:25:57,166
 Chess...Hail chess!

416
00:26:04,125 --> 00:26:05,541
 One thing is for sure

417
00:26:06,041 --> 00:26:09,500
the journey is spoiled if you wife accompanies you

418
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,375
Excuse me? - Didn't you understand? - No

419
00:26:12,875 --> 00:26:15,375
We have been married for nine years

420
00:26:15,875 --> 00:26:20,416
My eyesight has weakened looking at the same face day and night

421
00:26:20,916 --> 00:26:22,583
 The eyes too need a tonic

422
00:26:23,083 --> 00:26:26,000
You look very jovial - Look like?... I am

423
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,583
Is it? - Yes...my name is Rasiklal

424
00:26:29,083 --> 00:26:32,083
 Bless you!

425
00:26:32,583 --> 00:26:33,291
 What business are you into?

426
00:26:33,791 --> 00:26:35,583
Is taking care of father's business call our own business?

427
00:26:36,083 --> 00:26:37,916
Yes...Of course - I do the same

428
00:26:38,416 --> 00:26:39,541
 There is a dye factory in Kolkata...

429
00:26:40,041 --> 00:26:43,291
 ..and a business into Banarasi saris

430
00:26:43,791 --> 00:26:46,541
 Save your elephant

431
00:26:47,041 --> 00:26:49,750
 My elephant is gone Sir

432
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:53,458
 ...but you should save your soldier

433
00:26:53,958 --> 00:26:55,291
 Hey...you are expert player

434
00:26:55,791 --> 00:26:56,458
 What do you do?

435
00:26:56,958 --> 00:26:58,083
I cleared my medical examinations this year

436
00:26:58,583 --> 00:26:59,291
Medical? - Yes

437
00:26:59,791 --> 00:27:01,125
 Then you will open a dispensary...

438
00:27:01,625 --> 00:27:02,625
 ..in a big city

439
00:27:03,125 --> 00:27:04,666
No..if every Doctor goes to the city..

440
00:27:05,166 --> 00:27:08,541
..who will take care of the people form the village

441
00:27:09,041 --> 00:27:10,500
 I was looking for someone like you

442
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,166
I have finally met you What is your name?

443
00:27:13,666 --> 00:27:16,333
Its..Deepak - It's a very good name

444
00:27:16,833 --> 00:27:18,000
 Bring light into my life

445
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:21,541
Send me to heavenly abode - What are you saying?

446
00:27:22,041 --> 00:27:23,833
 Didn't you understand?

447
00:27:24,333 --> 00:27:28,125
All rich people.. want to do good deeds

448
00:27:28,625 --> 00:27:30,166
 Some give charity..some build temples

449
00:27:30,666 --> 00:27:31,833
I want to serve the poor, Doctor

450
00:27:32,333 --> 00:27:33,958
 Sir..I too want to serve the poor..

451
00:27:34,458 --> 00:27:36,791
..but I have no resources as of now

452
00:27:37,291 --> 00:27:38,708
 I am trying to tell you the same thing

453
00:27:39,208 --> 00:27:40,916
I had started a dispensary in my village

454
00:27:41,416 --> 00:27:42,125
 ..I hired Doctors too..

455
00:27:42,625 --> 00:27:43,791
..but no one wants to stay in a village

456
00:27:44,291 --> 00:27:46,791
 You can run the dispensary, Doctor

457
00:27:47,291 --> 00:27:49,541
The dispensary will be yours.. but I will invest the money

458
00:27:50,041 --> 00:27:52,500
You will serve...but I will be respected...you get that?

459
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,500
 You have fulfilled my desires

460
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,166
 I will get down with you

461
00:27:59,666 --> 00:28:00,708
 Bless you, Doctor

462
00:28:01,208 --> 00:28:02,208
 I can die peacefully now

463
00:28:02,708 --> 00:28:05,041
I will not be sad even if you beat me in this game

464
00:28:05,541 --> 00:28:09,041
 Here you go..check mate

465
00:28:20,916 --> 00:28:24,416
Shall I start, Doctor? - Yes

466
00:28:28,333 --> 00:28:30,500
 What shall I say?

467
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,416
 Say brothers and sisters..

468
00:28:35,916 --> 00:28:39,208
 Brothers...and sis

469
00:28:39,708 --> 00:28:42,458
 Sisters? have you lost it?

470
00:28:42,958 --> 00:28:45,125
Don't you see my wife is sitting right in front

471
00:28:45,625 --> 00:28:46,791
 Sister?

472
00:28:47,291 --> 00:28:51,500
Then say... the people of this village

473
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,083
 Bless the people of this village...

474
00:28:54,583 --> 00:28:55,791
 ..and the Chieftain

475
00:28:56,291 --> 00:28:58,958
This dispensary...this Anand Ashram

476
00:28:59,458 --> 00:29:02,041
 ..is being started again

477
00:29:02,541 --> 00:29:10,000
God has sent this Doctor to serve you this time

478
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,708
This dispensary was locked for two years

479
00:29:13,208 --> 00:29:14,583
 the Doctor had ran away

480
00:29:15,083 --> 00:29:17,458
He didn't like to stay in the village

481
00:29:17,958 --> 00:29:22,583
This Doctor has pledged to stay in this village and serve you

482
00:29:23,083 --> 00:29:26,583
Hail the Doctor.. Applaud

483
00:29:30,708 --> 00:29:33,208
 Now your duty is to help him

484
00:29:33,708 --> 00:29:37,208
..and lock everyone in our dispensary

485
00:29:41,125 --> 00:29:43,333
 Not everyone...only the sick

486
00:29:43,833 --> 00:29:45,708
 Not everyone...only the sick

487
00:29:46,208 --> 00:29:47,000
 So that...

488
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:48,625
 So that..it brings me respect

489
00:29:49,125 --> 00:29:52,625
So that it brings pride to our village. Applaud

490
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:00,750
 Dear... - Yes

491
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:02,000
 Show sister-in-law our house

492
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:02,875
 I will do that

493
00:30:03,375 --> 00:30:05,083
 Come I will show you around

494
00:30:05,583 --> 00:30:09,250
 Yes Doctor...how was the speech?

495
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:10,166
 Very good

496
00:30:10,666 --> 00:30:12,750
The people applauded Isn't it Chieftain?

497
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:15,166
There is nothing to be said about it

498
00:30:15,666 --> 00:30:17,916
 I am good at giving speeches

499
00:30:18,416 --> 00:30:19,958
...but my feet tremble..when I speak

500
00:30:20,458 --> 00:30:23,958
It happens in the beginning - Is it?...that's why

501
00:30:24,458 --> 00:30:27,000
 Doctor...this is for your patients..

502
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:28,750
 ..and this is your place to stay

503
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:30,458
 There is everything here..

504
00:30:30,958 --> 00:30:32,333
 ..but if you still need something..

505
00:30:32,833 --> 00:30:33,208
 ...write to me..

506
00:30:33,708 --> 00:30:35,875
 ..I will send it from the city

507
00:30:36,375 --> 00:30:37,958
 You have trapped me

508
00:30:38,458 --> 00:30:39,708
 I will not forget your favours

509
00:30:40,208 --> 00:30:43,000
 What are you saying, Doctor?

510
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:47,083
Chieftain..the Doctor should be respected.. the way I am

511
00:30:47,583 --> 00:30:51,541
 Don't you worry, Sir

512
00:30:52,041 --> 00:30:56,416
 Listen... it's time for our train

513
00:30:56,916 --> 00:30:58,625
 Doctor...we have to leave

514
00:30:59,125 --> 00:31:00,583
 Will you be leaving today?

515
00:31:01,083 --> 00:31:04,041
I have to take care of the businesses in the city too - But Sir..

516
00:31:04,541 --> 00:31:06,583
...the villagers will not let you go today

517
00:31:07,083 --> 00:31:08,208
 Why? Why will they not let me go?

518
00:31:08,708 --> 00:31:12,208
The villagers have arranged a cultural programme

519
00:31:18,208 --> 00:31:22,041
Listen...Doctor is asking us to leave tomorrow

520
00:31:22,541 --> 00:31:24,541
 He is right... go tomorrow

521
00:31:25,041 --> 00:31:26,333
 Come

522
00:31:26,833 --> 00:31:30,125

Tell her not to flirt with me this time - Why?

526
00:31:40,291 --> 00:31:42,958
My wife is with me - I got it

527

528

 "I will come...whenever you want"

00:32:08,666 --> 00:32:13,000
 "I will come...whenever you want"

531
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:16,416

 "I will praise our friendship"

535
00:32:32,541 --> 00:32:36,041

 "Don't be scared of the world"

538
00:33:02,958 --> 00:33:05,833
 "Gulp the passions of my beauty"

539

 "Make the night colourful"

540
00:33:13,208 --> 00:33:16,083
 "This is a night of happiness"

541
00:33:16,583 --> 00:33:19,583
 "Don't be scared of the world"

542
00:33:20,083 --> 00:33:22,958

00:33:33,583 --> 00:33:41,958
 "I will give myself to you"

546
00:33:42,458 --> 00:33:47,208
 "I will come...whenever you want"

547
00:33:47,708 --> 00:33:51,208
 "I will come...whenever you want"

548
00:34:09,375 --> 00:34:15,750
"The one who is planning to cheat... meet me in secret"

549
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:26,125
"Meet me in a crowd...if you are loyal to me"

550
00:34:26,625 --> 00:34:32,958
"The one who is planning to cheat... meet me in secret"

551
00:34:33,458 --> 00:34:39,833
"Meet me in a crowd...if you are loyal to me"

552
00:34:40,333 --> 00:34:42,708
"Call me only if you are going to be true to me'

553
00:34:43,208 --> 00:34:46,541
 "Don't look at me sitting there"

554
00:34:47,041 --> 00:34:51,708
"I will not return .. once I come"

555
00:34:52,208 --> 00:34:56,541
 "I will come...whenever you want"

556
00:34:57,041 --> 00:35:02,791
 "Call me lovingly... Test me"

557
00:35:03,291 --> 00:35:06,666
"This love from our childhood.. is very dear to me"

558
00:35:07,166 --> 00:35:11,750
 "I will praise our friendship"

559
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:15,750
 "I will come...whenever you want"

560
00:35:34,208 --> 00:35:34,875
 Oh! Girdhari!

561
00:35:35,375 --> 00:35:39,750
It's very late in the night Aren't you sleeping?

562
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:43,750
I will - Shall I ask you something, Sir?

563
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:46,333
Please look for your son

564
00:35:46,833 --> 00:35:50,250
 Not required...you can go

565
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:53,541
 Place this bed like this

566
00:35:54,041 --> 00:35:55,041
 This isn't right

567
00:35:55,541 --> 00:35:56,500
 ..the head rest should be on that side

568
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,625
 Alright..do as the lady Doctor says

569
00:36:00,125 --> 00:36:04,708
 Go..Is it fine lady Doctor?

570
00:36:05,208 --> 00:36:05,875
 Pick it...

571
00:36:06,375 --> 00:36:07,708
 Keep this here...

572
00:36:08,208 --> 00:36:10,500
 ..and this here

573
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,958
 Alright

574
00:36:13,458 --> 00:36:14,500
Have you fixed it properly? - Yes

575
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,500
 Alright

576
00:36:20,291 --> 00:36:22,333
Has Raskilalji sent the medicines? - Yes

577
00:36:22,833 --> 00:36:25,208
 Alright...you can keep it inside

578
00:36:25,708 --> 00:36:28,541
 Asha

579
00:36:29,041 --> 00:36:30,500
Asha..look.. - What is it?

580
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,083
Rasiklal has sent too many medicines

581
00:36:32,583 --> 00:36:36,083
 Thank God...nothing is lacking anymore

582
00:36:42,375 --> 00:36:44,458
 Doctor, please check my mother

583
00:36:44,958 --> 00:36:47,500
What happened, Dukhiya Aunt? - I always have fever, Doctor

584
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,708
She sneaks into the kitchen and eats pickle

585
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:50,750
 So what?

586
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:52,083
 Does your wife prepare it for me?

587
00:36:52,583 --> 00:36:53,333
 I make it myself..and eat it

588
00:36:53,833 --> 00:36:55,375
I have understood Dukhiya Aunt

589
00:36:55,875 --> 00:36:56,958
 you have to stop eating pickle

590
00:36:57,458 --> 00:36:59,708
Asha...admit her to Ward number 2

591
00:37:00,208 --> 00:37:00,958
Come Aunt - Take her

592
00:37:01,458 --> 00:37:02,458
 Please let me stay here

593
00:37:02,958 --> 00:37:04,708
 My daughter-in-law..

594
00:37:05,208 --> 00:37:08,708
..has made my life hell at home

595
00:37:11,125 --> 00:37:16,000
Asha, isn't this a gulmohar tree? - Yes

596
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:19,541
This is the symbol of our love - Is it?

597
00:37:20,041 --> 00:37:25,458
Do you know Gulmohar has a specialty - What is that?

598
00:37:25,958 --> 00:37:28,041
 If we love each other a lot

599
00:37:28,541 --> 00:37:30,833
 its flowers would be deep red

600
00:37:31,333 --> 00:37:31,958
 Is it?

601
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:34,500
 And if we do not love each other

602
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,500
..then the flowers would turn yellow

603
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:43,500
Shall I give this gulmohar something? Right now..

604
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,333
Now? - What are you doing?

605
00:37:45,833 --> 00:37:47,541
 Listen to me Asha

606
00:37:48,041 --> 00:37:51,541
 Look when this tree grows up

607
00:37:52,041 --> 00:37:56,125
 ..we will build a dais around..

608
00:37:56,625 --> 00:38:00,375
We will lie under it... on a mattress

609
00:38:00,875 --> 00:38:03,541
 The flowers will shower on us

610
00:38:04,041 --> 00:38:06,375
An what the flowers that will bloom in our house...

611
00:38:06,875 --> 00:38:08,125
 Will see then

612
00:38:08,625 --> 00:38:12,125
 Listen

613
00:38:16,083 --> 00:38:20,125
 Hey...come here

614
00:38:20,625 --> 00:38:21,458
 What is it, your majesty?

615
00:38:21,958 --> 00:38:25,458
 Tell me is it up or down?

616
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:28,250
 Up or down?

617
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:31,916
Tell me is it five or three beatings?

618
00:38:32,416 --> 00:38:34,416
Five beatings...say it quickly - Up

619
00:38:34,916 --> 00:38:38,416
 Up

620
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:44,916
Down... - You have lost it

621
00:38:45,416 --> 00:38:48,833
Five beatings - You want to hit me five times

622
00:38:49,333 --> 00:38:50,708
What else? - Alright beat me

623
00:38:51,208 --> 00:38:54,500
I will definitely beat you - Beat

624
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,333
Hey.. - Don't look

625
00:38:56,833 --> 00:38:57,833
 This wasn't the bet..

626
00:38:58,333 --> 00:39:02,708
 I will hereafter..lose all the bet

627
00:39:03,208 --> 00:39:06,625
 My wifey

628
00:39:07,125 --> 00:39:08,750
 Here

629
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:12,541
Devideen... take your medicine - Yes Sister

630
00:39:13,041 --> 00:39:17,250
Look...first the medicine in the bottle and then these pills

631
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:20,625
..after that again the medicine in this bottle

632
00:39:21,125 --> 00:39:25,458
Laxmi... give me your card - then the medicine in the bottle

633
00:39:25,958 --> 00:39:27,125
 Sister..I didn't understand

634
00:39:27,625 --> 00:39:29,416
 What did you say?

635
00:39:29,916 --> 00:39:31,500
First the medicine in the bottle.. - in the bottle...

636
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,166
 ..and then the pills

637
00:39:34,666 --> 00:39:37,041
I am not talking about liquor served in bottle

638
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:40,083
What else?...- I will not let you consume that ever again

639
00:39:40,583 --> 00:39:41,250
 I will leave it...

640
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:45,500
I can never disobey you - Get going now

641
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:51,750
What has he written? Wait for moment - Yes

642
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:53,375
 What have you written?

643
00:39:53,875 --> 00:39:54,875
 Atleast write it clearly

644
00:39:55,375 --> 00:39:57,166
 it is written very clearly

645
00:39:57,666 --> 00:39:58,375
 What is it? Where is it?

646
00:39:58,875 --> 00:40:01,583
 This...Soda-bicarb

647
00:40:02,083 --> 00:40:04,291
Is this soda-bicar? - Yes

648
00:40:04,791 --> 00:40:09,541
But your love has more effect than the medicines

649
00:40:10,041 --> 00:40:12,458
 What are you doing?

650
00:40:12,958 --> 00:40:16,583
These people need love and care.. along with medicines

651
00:40:17,083 --> 00:40:19,500
 And what about me?

652
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,500
 Oh my God

653
00:40:24,541 --> 00:40:28,041
 Laxmi...atleast take your medicine

654
00:40:33,041 --> 00:40:34,625
 I feel very cold, Doctor

655
00:40:35,125 --> 00:40:36,416
Are you feeling cold? - Yes

656
00:40:36,916 --> 00:40:38,125
 Which pond do you drink water from?

657
00:40:38,625 --> 00:40:39,875
The pond which everyone drinks from

658
00:40:40,375 --> 00:40:41,000
 That is the problem...

659
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:43,583
...you have been drinking malaria instead of water

660
00:40:44,083 --> 00:40:47,583
Firstly we have to take care of that pond

661
00:40:51,208 --> 00:40:54,166
Throw the lime...throw it in all the corners

662
00:40:54,666 --> 00:40:56,083
 And look.

663
00:40:56,583 --> 00:41:00,208
hereafter...the water from this pond should only be used to drink

664
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:03,500
 No bathing and washing clothes in this

665
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,125
You get that? - Whatever you say - Alright

666
00:41:06,625 --> 00:41:06,875
 Excuse me.

667
00:41:07,375 --> 00:41:08,958
Are you Dr.Deepak? - Yes...and you?

668
00:41:09,458 --> 00:41:10,416
I am a reporter from Bharat Samachar newspaper

669
00:41:10,916 --> 00:41:11,875
Greetings - Greetings

670
00:41:12,375 --> 00:41:14,833
You have changed the face of this village

671
00:41:15,333 --> 00:41:17,541
..and so I want to publish your interview in my newspaper

672
00:41:18,041 --> 00:41:19,625
...so that - My interview? - Yes

673
00:41:20,125 --> 00:41:22,000
 What will you do with my interview?

674
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:26,416
Come.. - Common

675
00:41:26,916 --> 00:41:27,291
Doctor - Yes

676
00:41:27,791 --> 00:41:29,708
The miracle that you have performed in this village - Yes..

677
00:41:30,208 --> 00:41:30,916
 ...this could set an example...

678
00:41:31,416 --> 00:41:32,875
...for other others from the city to migrate to the village

679
00:41:33,375 --> 00:41:35,541
 I believe that there will a day..

680
00:41:36,041 --> 00:41:37,541
..when the Doctors would realize that..

681
00:41:38,041 --> 00:41:40,583
..these villages need them - you are right

682
00:41:41,083 --> 00:41:43,250
Doctor, I would like to see your hospital

683
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:46,625
 Doctor, do you work all alone?

684
00:41:47,125 --> 00:41:49,375
No...my wife helps me a lot - Alright

685
00:41:49,875 --> 00:41:51,791
The truth is that she is my strength and inspiration

686
00:41:52,291 --> 00:41:53,166
it's absolutely necessary to meet her

687
00:41:53,666 --> 00:41:54,250
 Yes..sure..come

688
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:56,625
 Doctor can I take your picture?

689
00:41:57,125 --> 00:42:00,625
Picture? - Sharmaji

690
00:42:04,458 --> 00:42:07,416
Sir...give me your spectacles, let me wipe it

691
00:42:07,916 --> 00:42:08,250
 What is the matter?

692
00:42:08,750 --> 00:42:11,041
Look what is printed in the newspaper - What is it?

693
00:42:11,541 --> 00:42:13,250
 They have praise our dear Munna..

694
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:14,708
 ..they have published his picture too

695
00:42:15,208 --> 00:42:16,833
 Lord Shiva has answered my prayers

696
00:42:17,333 --> 00:42:18,250
 We have found him

697
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:22,125
 Look at the way Munna is smiling

698
00:42:22,625 --> 00:42:23,166
 He isn't smiling..

699
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:25,875
..but making a fool of me infront of the world

700
00:42:26,375 --> 00:42:27,791
 ..because I am left alone

701
00:42:28,291 --> 00:42:32,625
 Take it away..I don't want to see it

702
00:42:33,125 --> 00:42:34,708
 Can't you hear?

703
00:42:35,208 --> 00:42:36,791
 You shouldn't be mad at me

704
00:42:37,291 --> 00:42:39,250
 Call him back

705
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:41,208
 Everyone commits a mistake, Sir

706
00:42:41,708 --> 00:42:43,375
 This isn't a mistake, Girdhari

707
00:42:43,875 --> 00:42:46,875
I would have forgiven him..if it was a mistake

708
00:42:47,375 --> 00:42:50,666
But he has purposely revolted against his family

709
00:42:51,166 --> 00:42:53,125
 ...I am unable to forgive that

710
00:42:53,625 --> 00:42:58,250
Do not utter his name... go away

711
00:42:58,750 --> 00:43:02,250
 Let it be

712
00:43:26,875 --> 00:43:29,708
Master...has turned out to cold hearted

713
00:43:30,208 --> 00:43:32,916
Munna...stop acting stubborn... and come with me

714
00:43:33,416 --> 00:43:35,458
But how would that help, Girdhari Uncle?

715
00:43:35,958 --> 00:43:37,375
 I will apologize to him

716
00:43:37,875 --> 00:43:43,458
...but father will not accept Asha as his daughter-in-law

717
00:43:43,958 --> 00:43:45,125
Asha.. -Yes

718
00:43:45,625 --> 00:43:47,958
Asha...come take a look.. Girdhari Uncle is here

719
00:43:48,458 --> 00:43:51,875
Girdhari Uncle she wasn't fortunate to take blessings from my father..

720
00:43:52,375 --> 00:43:55,458
 ..you should bless her

721
00:43:55,958 --> 00:43:56,708
 Bless you dear

722
00:43:57,208 --> 00:43:58,583
 May you be fortunate

723
00:43:59,083 --> 00:44:01,625
Hey...you have turned impure..now that you have touched her

724
00:44:02,125 --> 00:44:03,875
 What will happen now?

725
00:44:04,375 --> 00:44:07,541
I have turned pure after touching her, Munna

726
00:44:08,041 --> 00:44:10,541
 Do you want me to go to hell...

727
00:44:11,041 --> 00:44:12,416
..by insulting a good daughter-in-law like her?

728
00:44:12,916 --> 00:44:14,166
 What shall I bring for your Uncle?

729
00:44:14,666 --> 00:44:16,416
Tea or sherbet? - Don't worry Uncle..

730
00:44:16,916 --> 00:44:17,625
..she will prepare it in the holy water

731
00:44:18,125 --> 00:44:19,708
 Are you pulling me?

732
00:44:20,208 --> 00:44:23,458
Daughter-in-law...only tea or sherbet is not going to help..

733
00:44:23,958 --> 00:44:27,750
I spent four hours in the train just eating two banana's

734
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:29,416
 I am guest...

735
00:44:29,916 --> 00:44:34,250

 You have found sandalwood

739
00:44:42,083 --> 00:44:43,666
 We are unfortunate...

740
00:44:44,166 --> 00:44:47,666
..daughter-in-law is a form of Goddess Laxmi

741
00:44:53,458 --> 00:44:54,291
 Doctor...

742
00:44:54,791 --> 00:44:58,625

 Oh my God..what is the matter?

747
00:45:08,875 --> 00:45:09,750
 The hospital is progressing...

748
00:45:10,250 --> 00:45:11,208
..a special ward is under construction..

749
00:45:11,708 --> 00:45:13,750
 The nurse too should look special

750
00:45:14,250 --> 00:45:16,625
But she shouldn't be looking so beautiful..

751
00:45:17,125 --> 00:45:18,833
..or the Doctor will forget his duties

752
00:45:19,333 --> 00:45:21,125
 Stay away

753
00:45:21,625 --> 00:45:23,208
 Stay away..huh?

754
00:45:23,708 --> 00:45:24,750
Hey...Dinu - Yes Sir

755
00:45:25,250 --> 00:45:30,916
Go get the photographer...who stays near the station - Alright

756
00:45:31,416 --> 00:45:32,625
 Why a photographer?

 Now I am nurse...

760
00:45:41,750 --> 00:45:43,333
 Walk with me like a Doctor

761
00:45:43,833 --> 00:45:45,500
 Is it?

762
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,375
 Alright

763
00:45:48,875 --> 00:45:51,458
 Aunt Dukhiya...

764
00:45:51,958 --> 00:45:53,208
 ..why has the fever increased?

765
00:45:53,708 --> 00:45:56,125
Son..I will be fine.. why did you bother?

766
00:45:56,625 --> 00:46:00,041
 Get up... pull your tongue out

767
00:46:00,541 --> 00:46:01,250
 The body is feverish...

768
00:46:01,750 --> 00:46:02,416
 ...the cough is in the chest..

769
00:46:02,916 --> 00:46:03,625
 What is there in the mouth?

770
00:46:04,125 --> 00:46:08,291
 What is in there!...Let me show you

771
00:46:08,791 --> 00:46:09,291
 What is this?

772
00:46:09,791 --> 00:46:10,750
 So what? its pickle

773
00:46:11,250 --> 00:46:12,541
 You have been eating pickle again

774

00:46:15,208 --> 00:46:17,458
 Aunt Dukhiya..I cannot treat you

776
00:46:17,958 --> 00:46:19,333
You can go home... Spare me

00:46:19,833 --> 00:46:23,625
Son...let me stay here.. I am happy here

778
00:46:24,125 --> 00:46:26,333
If I go home...my daughter-in-law..

779
00:46:26,833 --> 00:46:29,666
 ..asks me to do all the chores

780
00:46:30,166 --> 00:46:32,541
 Daughter-in-law...isn't it good?

781
00:46:33,041 --> 00:46:35,708
 Didn't I ask you to throw it out?

782
00:46:36,208 --> 00:46:37,541
 You have started eating it

783
00:46:38,041 --> 00:46:39,750
 Go...and throw it away

784
00:46:40,250 --> 00:46:41,958
 Alright

785
00:46:42,458 --> 00:46:44,833
Aunt Dukhiya...go home and take rest

786
00:46:45,333 --> 00:46:48,000
Asha...what happened? - I fell giddy

787
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:50,875
Giddiness? Why? Are you feeling alright?

788
00:46:51,375 --> 00:46:52,541
 Wow..Doctor..

789
00:46:53,041 --> 00:46:55,541
..is this what you learned as doctor? - Why?

790
00:46:56,041 --> 00:46:57,500
..Something in her stomach is making her giddy

791
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:58,708
 Something in her stomach?

792
00:46:59,208 --> 00:47:03,500
 Did you understand daughter-in-law?

793
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,791
Hey...Asha...is it true? Tell me

794
00:47:09,291 --> 00:47:12,333
 What will happen...Aunt Dukhiya?

795
00:47:12,833 --> 00:47:14,625
What else?..you will have a son - A son right?

796
00:47:15,125 --> 00:47:18,625
A son? - Yes - Let me feed you some pickle

797
00:47:28,041 --> 00:47:29,541
 Chose one among these

798
00:47:30,041 --> 00:47:30,541
 Why?

799
00:47:31,041 --> 00:47:35,041
I want to know if it's a boy or a girl

800
00:47:35,541 --> 00:47:36,750
 This isn't needed

801
00:47:37,250 --> 00:47:37,833
 I already know

802
00:47:38,333 --> 00:47:39,583

803
00:47:40,083 --> 00:47:44,375

804
00:47:44,875 --> 00:47:47,125

807
00:47:52,208 --> 00:47:54,416
Will you send him to a foreign country?

808
00:47:54,916 --> 00:47:56,541
No...what if he never comes back to the village?

809
00:47:57,041 --> 00:47:57,833
 Why will he not?

810
00:47:58,333 --> 00:48:00,083
I will pull his ears and bring him here

811
00:48:00,583 --> 00:48:02,291
 But he will go to study abroad

812
00:48:02,791 --> 00:48:05,083
 The things that you didn't achieve..

813
00:48:05,583 --> 00:48:06,916
 ..he will surely achieve it

814
00:48:07,416 --> 00:48:11,208
Yes...but.. - Tell me...won't you send him abroad?

815

"I have tied all your love into my veil"

840
00:51:25,541 --> 00:51:29,041
"I will see new charms of your beauty..in every moment"

841
00:51:58,875 --> 00:52:01,416
Aunt... - Why are you getting impatient?

842
00:52:01,916 --> 00:52:03,166
Everything is fine Go take rest

843
00:52:03,666 --> 00:52:05,500

 You should go get a mid-wife

00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:31,791
 The mid-wife is scared..

854
00:52:32,291 --> 00:52:33,666

 Why isn't the baby crying?

00:57:03,166 --> 00:57:06,666
 This is impossible...Asha

912
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:11,458
 Doctor...

913
00:58:11,958 --> 00:58:14,083
..please save my father - What happened?

914
00:58:14,583 --> 00:58:15,583
He fall from the tree and hurt his head

915
00:58:16,083 --> 00:58:18,041
Hurt his head? - Yes

916
00:58:18,541 --> 00:58:19,500
 Alright...take him to the hospital

917
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:23,500
 I will be there soon

918
00:58:26,625 --> 00:58:29,166
Dinu... Aunt Dukhiya...is someone around?

919
00:58:29,666 --> 00:58:30,791
 Please take care of the baby

920
00:58:31,291 --> 00:58:34,708
Give the baby to me - Uncle?

921
00:58:35,208 --> 00:58:37,541
I had come to visit Baba Tarakhnath

922
00:58:38,041 --> 00:58:39,833
I met the Chieftain of this village there

923
00:58:40,333 --> 00:58:41,875
 He told me about everything

924
00:58:42,375 --> 00:58:43,833
 Give me the baby

925
00:58:44,333 --> 00:58:46,291
Take care of him... - Yes

926
00:58:46,791 --> 00:58:47,291
 I will be back soon

927
00:58:47,791 --> 00:58:51,291
 My darling son...

928
00:59:01,750 --> 00:59:06,208
Munna...listen to me... let's go back home

929
00:59:06,708 --> 00:59:11,958
No Uncle...that is not possible - Why not, son?

930
00:59:12,458 --> 00:59:14,833
 The house there looks deserted

931
00:59:15,333 --> 00:59:18,916
The father...wanders around like a crazy man

932
00:59:19,416 --> 00:59:20,500
 Listen to me...

933
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,583
 ..do not torment your old father

934
00:59:23,083 --> 00:59:24,625
 Let's go back home

935
00:59:25,125 --> 00:59:29,416
All the doors to go back are closed, Uncle

936
00:59:29,916 --> 00:59:31,458
 This is my home now

937
00:59:31,958 --> 00:59:33,875
 This is my world

938
00:59:34,375 --> 00:59:38,000
Every wall and pillar reminds me of Asha

939
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:43,291
 How can I leave all of this?

940
00:59:43,791 --> 00:59:46,166
Then...give me your son - to you?

941
00:59:46,666 --> 00:59:50,541
I will bring him up... educate him..and make him a Doctor

942
00:59:51,041 --> 00:59:54,791
...in the house...where his mother was never respected?

943
00:59:55,291 --> 00:59:57,875
 No Uncle...this isn't possible

944
00:59:58,375 --> 01:00:01,333
Don't make your son suffer for your father's deeds, Munna

945
01:00:01,833 --> 01:00:03,375
 I will keep him close to me

946
01:00:03,875 --> 01:00:05,000
 Please send him with me

947
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:10,166
No Uncle...this is the only remains of Asha

948
01:00:10,666 --> 01:00:14,291
I cannot send him to that house - But how will you take care of him?

949
01:00:14,791 --> 01:00:16,666
How will you find time to take care of him...

950
01:00:17,166 --> 01:00:18,666
...when you are busy with your patients?

951
01:00:19,166 --> 01:00:20,208
 How will he study?

952
01:00:20,708 --> 01:00:22,750
How will you fulfill daughter-in-law's last wish?

953
01:00:23,250 --> 01:00:25,916
Will he become a Doctor...by studying in the village school?

954
01:00:26,416 --> 01:00:27,041
 Think about it

955
01:00:27,541 --> 01:00:30,375
 Alright... but I have a condition

956
01:00:30,875 --> 01:00:31,833
 What is it?

957
01:00:32,333 --> 01:00:34,500
No one should know that he is my son

958
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,500
How is that possible? - No Uncle

959
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:37,500
 This is the condition...

960
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,708
If you promise that you will never tell my father..

961
01:00:41,208 --> 01:00:43,625
..about his parents.. then you can take him

962
01:00:44,125 --> 01:00:46,500
If you are adamant.. then I promise you

963
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,250
 Yes...take him..and...

964
01:00:49,750 --> 01:00:53,250
..Uncle...I am giving him to you and only you

965
01:00:58,208 --> 01:01:01,250
Sir...give me you spectacle.. let me wipe it

966
01:01:01,750 --> 01:01:05,250
What do I have to write? - Look... what is written on it?

967
01:01:08,625 --> 01:01:12,750
This orphaned child..a baby from a high-...

968
01:01:13,250 --> 01:01:15,583
..what is this? - Must be Brahmin

969
01:01:16,083 --> 01:01:17,000
 ...high-caste Brahmin family

970
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:18,083
 Whoever gets this baby...

971
01:01:18,583 --> 01:01:21,083
..should leave him at an orphanage Would be a favour

972
01:01:21,583 --> 01:01:22,583
He doesn't know to write.. who has written this?

973
01:01:23,083 --> 01:01:24,000
 How would I know?

974
01:01:24,500 --> 01:01:26,708
This was tied to the baby's neck

975
01:01:27,208 --> 01:01:29,833
Sir...I committed a good deed unknowingly

976
01:01:30,333 --> 01:01:31,500
 How would I know that...

977
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,583
 ..this was a Brahman's child?

978
01:01:34,083 --> 01:01:36,041
Who are you talking about? - The baby

979
01:01:36,541 --> 01:01:38,291
I was returning after bathing at the river..

980
01:01:38,791 --> 01:01:41,083
 ..suddenly I heard a child crying

981
01:01:41,583 --> 01:01:42,291
 I went forward to look at it..

982
01:01:42,791 --> 01:01:46,083
..I saw a baby crying at the river strand

983
01:01:46,583 --> 01:01:47,750
 I couldn't leave it there

984
01:01:48,250 --> 01:01:49,875
 I bought it here

985
01:01:50,375 --> 01:01:53,375
Have you brought it here? Have you gone crazy?

986
01:01:53,875 --> 01:01:54,916
 God knows..who does it belong to?

987
01:01:55,416 --> 01:01:56,333
 Why did you bring it here?

988
01:01:56,833 --> 01:01:57,666
 How big is the baby?

989
01:01:58,166 --> 01:01:59,500
 Five to six months

990
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,750
Five or six months only? - Yes

991
01:02:02,250 --> 01:02:03,458
 It's a Brahmin's child...

992
01:02:03,958 --> 01:02:06,083
 ..we have to take care of it

993
01:02:06,583 --> 01:02:08,541
 No...let's not carry the burden

994
01:02:09,041 --> 01:02:10,500
How will be take care of such a small child?

995
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:16,333
 The way we took care of Munna

996
01:02:16,833 --> 01:02:19,791
 I mean...wouldn't we take care...

997
01:02:20,291 --> 01:02:24,750
 ...if it was Munna's baby?

998
01:02:25,250 --> 01:02:28,125
 You have uttered his name again

999
01:02:28,625 --> 01:02:30,291
 Didn't we bring him up?

1000
01:02:30,791 --> 01:02:31,500
 What did we get in return?

1001
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:35,666
Did he even bother to see if we were dead or alive?

1002
01:02:36,166 --> 01:02:39,583
Motherhood and desires do not go hand in hand, Girdhari

1003
01:02:40,083 --> 01:02:42,208
No...the baby will not stay in this house

1004
01:02:42,708 --> 01:02:43,875
You are putting me in trouble..

1005
01:02:44,375 --> 01:02:46,041
Where will I leave the innocent baby?

1006
01:02:46,541 --> 01:02:48,625
Wouldn't I be committing sin? -Its not about sin..

1007
01:02:49,125 --> 01:02:52,083
...you are burdening yourself

1008
01:02:52,583 --> 01:02:54,625
Girdhari... our loved one has turned his back on us

1009
01:02:55,125 --> 01:02:56,750
...how could this god forsaken baby be ours?

1010
01:02:57,250 --> 01:03:00,750
 Arrange some other place for it

1011
01:03:04,250 --> 01:03:06,750
 Silly boy!...are you laughing?

1012
01:03:07,250 --> 01:03:10,541
Grandpa..has asked me to take you somewhere else

1013
01:03:11,041 --> 01:03:12,791
 If you want to stay in this house...

1014
01:03:13,291 --> 01:03:16,791
..you have to cry, to convince your grandfather...Common

1015
01:03:22,791 --> 01:03:26,291
 Is the baby still here?

1016
01:03:29,166 --> 01:03:32,666
 Why is it crying?

1017
01:03:34,250 --> 01:03:38,000
 Girdhari...

1018
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:39,416
 ..the baby has been crying

1019
01:03:39,916 --> 01:03:43,500
 ... Why don't you pacify it?

1020
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:44,958
 Is he alone?

1021
01:03:45,458 --> 01:03:49,916
 Govind...Jaganath

1022
01:03:50,416 --> 01:03:52,625
Looks like all of them are sleeping

1023
01:03:53,125 --> 01:03:55,625
Girdhari.. - Hey Govind...come here

1024
01:03:56,125 --> 01:03:57,375
Master is calling for me - Let him call

1025
01:03:57,875 --> 01:04:02,291
You should hide inside... you should do your work

1026
01:04:02,791 --> 01:04:03,125
 The baby has been crying...

1027
01:04:03,625 --> 01:04:07,416
 ...and no one is bothered

1028
01:04:07,916 --> 01:04:11,000
 The baby has been crying

1029
01:04:11,500 --> 01:04:13,083
 There is no one here

1030
01:04:13,583 --> 01:04:15,041
The baby will cry... when he is alone

1031
01:04:15,541 --> 01:04:16,625
 Quiet...

1032
01:04:17,125 --> 01:04:21,125
 Quiet...

1033
01:04:21,625 --> 01:04:24,750
 Quiet

1034
01:04:25,250 --> 01:04:27,208
 Hey...he turned quiet

1035
01:04:27,708 --> 01:04:29,541
 Sir...what are you doing here?

1036
01:04:30,041 --> 01:04:31,833
Where were you? The baby has been crying since very long

1037
01:04:32,333 --> 01:04:33,166
 I had gone to get milk

1038
01:04:33,666 --> 01:04:36,500
I was sleeping peacefully when I went

1039
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:40,583
 Must have seen a scary dream

1040
01:04:41,083 --> 01:04:44,666
What are you looking at Sir? - Its strange Girdhari...

1041
01:04:45,166 --> 01:04:46,625
Deepak looked similar.. when he was a child

1042
01:04:47,125 --> 01:04:49,166
The same eyes..the face... look properly...

1043
01:04:49,666 --> 01:04:51,875
..doesn't he look more like Deepak

1044
01:04:52,375 --> 01:04:54,083
Didn't you notice? - How could I?

1045
01:04:54,583 --> 01:04:56,916
You have been scolding me.. since I got the baby

1046
01:04:57,416 --> 01:04:59,750
Listen...do you remember.. when Deepak cried when he was small..

1047
01:05:00,250 --> 01:05:01,666
...he used to turn quiet, when I shouted at him

1048
01:05:02,166 --> 01:05:02,833
 Yes..I remember that

1049
01:05:03,333 --> 01:05:05,958
I shouted at him to be quiet.. and he turned quiet

1050
01:05:06,458 --> 01:05:07,500
 Look he is looking at me

1051
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:09,541
 What are you looking at?

1052
01:05:10,041 --> 01:05:12,333
 Hey...why are you smiling?

1053
01:05:12,833 --> 01:05:15,625
 Wow...such a cute baby

1054
01:05:16,125 --> 01:05:20,375
Motherhood and desires do not go hand in hand, Girdhari

1055
01:05:20,875 --> 01:05:22,708
That is alright...this is just a small baby

1056
01:05:23,208 --> 01:05:25,291
God knows who does it belong to?

1057
01:05:25,791 --> 01:05:27,541
Why should we be a part of this sin?

1058
01:05:28,041 --> 01:05:29,541
I will drop it somewhere in the morning

1059
01:05:30,041 --> 01:05:31,583
Where? - Somewhere..

1060
01:05:32,083 --> 01:05:32,916
 ... he was picked from the road...

1061
01:05:33,416 --> 01:05:33,916
 I will drop it back to the road

1062
01:05:34,416 --> 01:05:36,416
Are you crazy? Will you throw away such a small baby?

1063
01:05:36,916 --> 01:05:39,291
What else can I do? - I was thinking..

1064
01:05:39,791 --> 01:05:40,708
 What were you thinking?

1065
01:05:41,208 --> 01:05:41,916
You said that you would take care of it...

1066
01:05:42,416 --> 01:05:45,625
Why don't you do that? - Me?...No I can't do that

1067
01:05:46,125 --> 01:05:48,250
Why not?...Didn't you take care of Deepak?

1068
01:05:48,750 --> 01:05:51,291
I am in a problem.. When I thought of raising it up..

1069
01:05:51,791 --> 01:05:52,500
 ..you asked me to drop it

1070
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:53,791
And now when I am ready to give it away...

1071
01:05:54,291 --> 01:05:54,708
 ...you are asking me to raise it

1072
01:05:55,208 --> 01:05:58,166
Tell me clearly..what to do? - Why are you getting offended?

1073
01:05:58,666 --> 01:06:00,625
 A bay is a form of God

1074
01:06:01,125 --> 01:06:04,458
Raise it... Go to sleep

1075
01:06:04,958 --> 01:06:08,458
 Alright...if you say

1076
01:06:10,583 --> 01:06:12,750
Hey...you have trapped the old man...

1077
01:06:13,250 --> 01:06:14,750
 ...by showing your face

1078
01:06:15,250 --> 01:06:18,750
 Prankster!

1079
01:06:30,333 --> 01:06:34,666
I feel very lonely without Pappu

1080
01:06:35,166 --> 01:06:38,708
 The loneliness is killing me

1081
01:06:39,208 --> 01:06:42,875
I am busy with work during the day

1082
01:06:43,375 --> 01:06:46,875
 ..and still I am restless

1083
01:07:27,583 --> 01:07:32,333
 "I left everyone for you"

1084
01:07:32,833 --> 01:07:37,458
 "...but you left me"

1085
01:07:37,958 --> 01:07:48,000
"How could you break the promise to live and die together?"

1086
01:07:48,500 --> 01:07:53,250
 "I left everyone for you"

1087
01:07:53,750 --> 01:07:58,500
 "...but you left me"

1088
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:02,500
"How could you brake the promise to live and die together?"

1089
01:08:35,625 --> 01:08:45,541
 "We dreamed under this tree"

1090
01:08:46,041 --> 01:08:55,750
"A storm ruined...the orchard of dreams"

1091
01:08:56,250 --> 01:09:00,666
 "The orchard of dreams"

1092
01:09:01,166 --> 01:09:11,375
"I didn't know, my world would come to an end so soon"

1093
01:09:11,875 --> 01:09:15,375
"How could you brake the promise to live and die together?"

1094
01:09:48,166 --> 01:09:57,875
"Why did time snatch your veil from my hands?"

1095
01:09:58,375 --> 01:10:07,416
"Of what use is life to me, when you are no more?"

1096
01:10:07,916 --> 01:10:12,875
 "Of what use is life to me?"

1097
01:10:13,375 --> 01:10:23,208
My love, why did you change the rituals, by taking a different path?"

1098
01:10:23,708 --> 01:10:33,583
"How could you break the promise to live and die together?"

1099
01:10:34,083 --> 01:10:37,583
 "I left everyone for you"

1100
01:10:46,666 --> 01:10:50,708
Raja babu... looks what have I got for you

1101
01:10:51,208 --> 01:10:53,416
Welcome..Lord... I didn't see you since morning..

1102
01:10:53,916 --> 01:10:54,208
 Where were you?

1103
01:10:54,708 --> 01:10:57,500
 Raja Babu has twisted my back..

1104
01:10:58,000 --> 01:10:59,041
...by asking me to play horse for him

1105
01:10:59,541 --> 01:11:00,000
 ...and so I brought this

1106
01:11:00,500 --> 01:11:02,666
Very good...you have gifted me salvation

1107
01:11:03,166 --> 01:11:06,333
Have you forgotten about the old man in this house...

1108
01:11:06,833 --> 01:11:08,166
..would you be busy with the child forever?

1109
01:11:08,666 --> 01:11:10,291
Are there no other people in this house?

1110
01:11:10,791 --> 01:11:11,500
 Tell me what is it?

1111
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:12,541
 Do nothing

1112
01:11:13,041 --> 01:11:14,708
Take this wooden horse to the stable..

1113
01:11:15,208 --> 01:11:16,666
..and sit on it... get that?

1114
01:11:17,166 --> 01:11:20,666
Yes I did... I am in trouble anyways

1115
01:11:31,791 --> 01:11:34,291
 What are you doing?

1116
01:11:34,791 --> 01:11:35,791
 Why are you messing with that?

1117
01:11:36,291 --> 01:11:36,916
 I want the horse

1118
01:11:37,416 --> 01:11:39,416
Are you a Prince..to ask for a horse?

1119
01:11:39,916 --> 01:11:43,416
 Get down

1120
01:11:45,750 --> 01:11:47,166
What happened? Why did you drop the books?

1121
01:11:47,666 --> 01:11:48,833
 Why did you pull my ears?

1122
01:11:49,333 --> 01:11:54,291
How dare you talk to me with attitude? - I will teach you a lesson

1123
01:11:54,791 --> 01:11:55,916
Hey get down.. why did you climb on my back?

1124
01:11:56,416 --> 01:11:58,958
Common horsy - You have turned into a horse

1125
01:11:59,458 --> 01:12:00,791
 Sit properly or you will fall

1126
01:12:01,291 --> 01:12:02,500
Common horsy.. - Yes I will

1127
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:09,375
 Common horsy..

01:12:15,250 --> 01:12:18,416

01:12:18,916 --> 01:12:23,375
I am walking - Common horsy..

1131
01:12:23,875 --> 01:12:26,916
Girdhari Uncle..please give me my whip

1132
01:12:27,416 --> 01:12:30,958
 Get down

1133
01:12:31,458 --> 01:12:35,000
Did you see the notorious one? He turned me into a horse

1134
01:12:35,500 --> 01:12:37,500
 Don't cry dear

1135
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:39,250
 This isn't a good horse

1136
01:12:39,750 --> 01:12:43,250
I will buy you a good horse Come

01:12:57,125 --> 01:13:00,208

 The Doctors are anchorites...

1148
01:13:42,166 --> 01:13:44,250
 ...why adorn this facade?

1149
01:13:44,750 --> 01:13:46,166

01:13:52,916 --> 01:13:54,791
 I have sent him away

1153
01:13:55,291 --> 01:13:57,833
...to a friend's house - Why?

1154
01:13:58,333 --> 01:14:00,000
 Meaning... just like that

1155
01:14:00,500 --> 01:14:03,041
 How would I raise him here?

1156
01:14:03,541 --> 01:14:05,541
We were not strangers, Doctor - No sister-in-law...

1157
01:14:06,041 --> 01:14:06,583

1158
01:14:07,083 --> 01:14:09,625

Come my darling...won't you come to me?

1161

 She is very mischievous

1162
01:14:18,416 --> 01:14:19,458
 She keeps me busy

1163
01:14:19,958 --> 01:14:21,125
She hides the pieces of my chessboard

1164
01:14:21,625 --> 01:14:23,583
Is it? - She loves me so much...

1165
01:14:24,083 --> 01:14:25,333
 ...that my heart feel pleasant

1166
01:14:25,833 --> 01:14:27,208
 The house is chirpy

1167
01:14:27,708 --> 01:14:32,833
Doctor...a house is incomplete without children

1168
01:14:33,333 --> 01:14:34,458
 Enough Raja babu

1169
01:14:34,958 --> 01:14:36,375
 No more...I am very tired

1170
01:14:36,875 --> 01:14:38,833
No Girdhari Uncle...I will ride it faster

1171
01:14:39,333 --> 01:14:42,541
Oh God... faster? Enough Raja Babu...

1172
01:14:43,041 --> 01:14:44,000
 ...let's go back

1173
01:14:44,500 --> 01:14:46,750
 No uncle...a little more

1174
01:14:47,250 --> 01:14:49,125
Oh God... - Faster

1175
01:14:49,625 --> 01:14:52,750
Sir Vikram Singh..are you done with horse ridding?

1176
01:14:53,250 --> 01:14:55,666
Yes - Very good

1177
01:14:56,166 --> 01:14:59,000
Grandpa..I will not go with Girdhari uncle tomorrow

1178
01:14:59,500 --> 01:15:00,458
 Why is that?

1179
01:15:00,958 --> 01:15:02,750
 He doesn't let me ride faster

1180
01:15:03,250 --> 01:15:07,708
Notorious one...I am tired running after you...

1181
01:15:08,208 --> 01:15:09,250
..and he says...I don't let him ride faster

1182
01:15:09,750 --> 01:15:11,375
 He is right Girdhari...

1183
01:15:11,875 --> 01:15:14,416
looking at your paunch...I am sure..you must not be running at all

1184
01:15:14,916 --> 01:15:17,166
Dear...ride the horse faster starting tomorrow

1185
01:15:17,666 --> 01:15:18,875
 Alright Grandpa

1186
01:15:19,375 --> 01:15:22,875
 I am in trouble

1187
01:15:39,291 --> 01:15:41,541
Is this a horse or an aero plane?

1188
01:15:42,041 --> 01:15:45,416
Does anyone ride the horse like that? - Peace

1189
01:15:45,916 --> 01:15:47,208
 Girdhari Uncle..the great..

1190
01:15:47,708 --> 01:15:50,666
..Will the horse ride me...or will I ride the horse?

1191
01:15:51,166 --> 01:15:52,208
 Think over it

1192
01:15:52,708 --> 01:15:55,291
Did you hear that Sir? - He is right..

1193
01:15:55,791 --> 01:15:58,708
...he is the grandson of Pratap Narayanlal Chaudhary

1194
01:15:59,208 --> 01:16:01,500
Did you get it...paunchy? Come inside

1195
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:07,208
My paunch has turned out to be a problem

1196
01:16:07,708 --> 01:16:11,750
 Son...this is your ticket

1197
01:16:12,250 --> 01:16:16,791
You are the first to go abroad from our family

1198
01:16:17,291 --> 01:16:19,875
The culture and the lifestyles there...

1199
01:16:20,375 --> 01:16:23,125
 ...misleads many

1200
01:16:23,625 --> 01:16:27,666
I believe that you will not forget your faith and culture

1201
01:16:28,166 --> 01:16:29,583
 Don't you worry, Grandpa

1202
01:16:30,083 --> 01:16:33,416
After all I am your grandson - Absolutely

1203
01:16:33,916 --> 01:16:35,750
 I trust you son...

1204
01:16:36,250 --> 01:16:39,541
...but it's a foreign land You will meet different people..

1205
01:16:40,041 --> 01:16:41,083
 ...who would cheat you

1206
01:16:41,583 --> 01:16:43,458
And so I was asking you to be careful

1207
01:16:43,958 --> 01:16:46,750
Sir...I have heard they eat horse meat..

1208
01:16:47,250 --> 01:16:48,916
 ..and also serve alcohol

1209
01:16:49,416 --> 01:16:51,958
 And the girls...trap you

1210
01:16:52,458 --> 01:16:53,666
 Girdhari Uncle..the great..

1211
01:16:54,166 --> 01:16:55,583
...that is why I am not taking you along

1212
01:16:56,083 --> 01:16:58,541
 What if some girl traps you?

1213
01:16:59,041 --> 01:17:01,541
 Sir..he is teasing me

1214
01:17:02,041 --> 01:17:03,083
 Come Uncle...lets pack the bags

1215
01:17:03,583 --> 01:17:07,083
Alright Grandpa... - Alright

1216
01:17:11,791 --> 01:17:14,500
 Asha...do you know?

1217
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:18,541
... your Prakash has gone abroad today

1218
01:17:19,041 --> 01:17:21,958
 Your dreams have come true

1219
01:17:22,458 --> 01:17:25,958
 Aren't you happy?

1220
01:17:39,583 --> 01:17:42,958
 Check-mate

1221
01:17:43,458 --> 01:17:45,541
 How long will I play alone?

1222
01:17:46,041 --> 01:17:47,333
 Isn't the Doctor coming?

1223
01:17:47,833 --> 01:17:51,333
 Kiran

 ...he will be here soon

1229
01:18:03,125 --> 01:18:05,083
 God knows...where is he!

1230
01:18:05,583 --> 01:18:09,625
 How long will I play alone?

1231
01:18:10,125 --> 01:18:11,541
 Play

1232
01:18:12,041 --> 01:18:16,041

01:18:16,541 --> 01:18:18,416
Uncle...you are here - Uncle

01:18:33,541 --> 01:18:34,958
I was waiting for you.. as I finished my turn

1240
01:18:35,458 --> 01:18:36,208
 Daddy...uncle must be tired..

1241
01:18:36,708 --> 01:18:37,833
 ...atleast let him eat something

1242
01:18:38,333 --> 01:18:39,000
 Bring it here

1243
01:18:39,500 --> 01:18:41,125
Sit...I have started the game - Come...- But Sir..

01:18:41,625 --> 01:18:42,791
 ..I have to go back soon

1245
01:18:43,291 --> 01:18:45,000
I had come here to purchase medicines

1246
01:18:45,500 --> 01:18:48,541
How long will the medicines and patients hold you?

1247
01:18:49,041 --> 01:18:51,375
You spent your life, serving the people

1248
01:18:51,875 --> 01:18:53,625
You have forgot playing chess too

1249
01:18:54,125 --> 01:18:55,333
 Play your turn

1250
01:18:55,833 --> 01:18:57,666
 I am no more used to this, Sir

1251
01:18:58,166 --> 01:19:00,000
 Change your habits

1252
01:19:00,500 --> 01:19:01,083
 Here...

1253
01:19:01,583 --> 01:19:04,375
 This is our age to play chess

1254
01:19:04,875 --> 01:19:05,500
 The children have grown up

1255
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:06,958
Kiran will be married in some days

1256
01:19:07,458 --> 01:19:09,083
Chandu..will take care of the business.. and...

1257

...your Pappu too must have grown up

1258
01:19:12,625 --> 01:19:13,333
 Where is he?

1259
01:19:13,833 --> 01:19:17,208
The people I sent him for studies...

1260
01:19:17,708 --> 01:19:18,541
 ...have adopted him

1261
01:19:19,041 --> 01:19:20,333
Adopted him? - Yes

1262
01:19:20,833 --> 01:19:22,625
Never mind... hire an assistant

1263
01:19:23,125 --> 01:19:24,083
 ..and come here forever

1264
01:19:24,583 --> 01:19:27,041
 We will play chess day and night

1265
01:19:27,541 --> 01:19:31,041
I have an assistant Sir but... - What are you waiting for?

1266
01:19:31,541 --> 01:19:33,541
Call him - There is still time

1267
01:19:34,041 --> 01:19:35,875
 The boy is studying abroad

1268
01:19:36,375 --> 01:19:37,458
 Who is studying abroad, Uncle?

1269
01:19:37,958 --> 01:19:39,541
The future assistant of your Doctor Uncle

1270
01:19:40,041 --> 01:19:42,333
What is his name? - Prakash

1271
01:19:42,833 --> 01:19:46,541
Prakash?..Is this the same Prakash, who studied at Scottish?

1272
01:19:47,041 --> 01:19:50,250
How do you know that he studied at Scottish?

1273
01:19:50,750 --> 01:19:52,791
 She not only knows but believes

1274
01:19:53,291 --> 01:19:54,708
 I have named him Mr. Nal

1275
01:19:55,208 --> 01:19:57,000
Nal...meaning a pipe.. what sort of a name is this?

1276
01:19:57,500 --> 01:19:58,250
 Not a pipe

1277
01:19:58,750 --> 01:19:59,916
 When there was a play at college...

1278
01:20:00,416 --> 01:20:01,541
...Sister played the role of Damayanti

1279
01:20:02,041 --> 01:20:03,708
..and he was ... - Oh that Nala

1280
01:20:04,208 --> 01:20:06,291
 Uncle, shall I show you Nala's photo?

1281
01:20:06,791 --> 01:20:07,291
 Yes...

1282
01:20:07,791 --> 01:20:10,208
His photo is in Sister's chemistry book..

1283
01:20:10,708 --> 01:20:12,625
 ..between 36 and 37 page

1284
01:20:13,125 --> 01:20:16,458
One moment..I hope he plays chess

1285
01:20:16,958 --> 01:20:18,708
Wait I will teach you a lesson Chandu

1286
01:20:19,208 --> 01:20:21,291
My problem is solved I will play another game...

1287
01:20:21,791 --> 01:20:23,458
 ...for the sake of it

1288
01:20:23,958 --> 01:20:25,166
 I will miss the train at six

1289
01:20:25,666 --> 01:20:27,500
Never mind...take the train at ten

1290
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,291
 You have put me in trouble

1291
01:20:30,791 --> 01:20:33,750
Don't worry.. your son will be fine

1292
01:20:34,250 --> 01:20:36,458
 Don't think...go to your house

1293
01:20:36,958 --> 01:20:38,708
 Uncle... when did you arrive?

1294
01:20:39,208 --> 01:20:41,625
 Munna...I have a good news for you

1295
01:20:42,125 --> 01:20:43,958
Tell me - Your son...

1296
01:20:44,458 --> 01:20:45,958
 ..is coming back the day after

1297
01:20:46,458 --> 01:20:47,541
 ...after achieving his degree

1298
01:20:48,041 --> 01:20:49,375
Day after? - Yes

1299
01:20:49,875 --> 01:20:52,083
The plane lands here at two in the afternoon

1300
01:20:52,583 --> 01:20:54,916
You should surely come at the airport

1301
01:20:55,416 --> 01:20:56,916
 I want to meet him, Uncle..

1302
01:20:57,416 --> 01:21:00,541
..but he will not recognise me

1303
01:21:01,041 --> 01:21:04,083
So what?..you should still come to the airport

1304
01:21:04,583 --> 01:21:06,500
 Alright...I will be there

1305
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:10,500
 Come home with me

1306
01:21:49,208 --> 01:21:53,791
My FRCS...how are you? Hope you are fine

1307
01:21:54,291 --> 01:21:55,333
Put the garland on him - Move aside Sir..

1308
01:21:55,833 --> 01:21:57,458
What happened? - Look

1309
01:21:57,958 --> 01:21:59,333
What are you doing Girdhari Uncle..the great?

1310
01:21:59,833 --> 01:22:01,916
You are touching the feet of the one who taught walking

1311
01:22:02,416 --> 01:22:04,666
It's a servants duty to touch his Master's feet

1312
01:22:05,166 --> 01:22:05,875
Look Grandpa.. - Lets go home...

1313
01:22:06,375 --> 01:22:09,375
..will complete the rest of the duties there. - Come

1314
01:22:09,875 --> 01:22:12,333
Girdhari..he came alone.. he didn't bring a girl alone

1315
01:22:12,833 --> 01:22:15,000
Raja babu...have you brought a girl alone?

1316
01:22:15,500 --> 01:22:17,541
 I have...she is in this bag

1317
01:22:18,041 --> 01:22:21,541
 She is very fair

1318
01:22:47,041 --> 01:22:49,166
 Son...I was saying..

1319
01:22:49,666 --> 01:22:53,416
...you cleared the medical exams.. your earned a degree abroad

1320
01:22:53,916 --> 01:22:56,541
 What are you planning to do now?

1321
01:22:57,041 --> 01:22:59,625
I will work, Grandpa - Work?

1322
01:23:00,125 --> 01:23:03,333
Why? - I thought you will start a hospital...

1323
01:23:03,833 --> 01:23:05,500
 ...in the village

1324
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:09,291
No one in our family has ever worked

1325
01:23:09,791 --> 01:23:12,041
But Grandpa...I finalized everything when I was abroad

1326
01:23:12,541 --> 01:23:13,208
 It's a foreign Company.

1327
01:23:13,708 --> 01:23:14,375
The work is related to medical research

1328
01:23:14,875 --> 01:23:16,916
Raja Babu..will you not be a Doctor?

1329
01:23:17,416 --> 01:23:18,750
 Girdhari Uncle..the great..

1330
01:23:19,250 --> 01:23:21,708
...I will be doing something bigger than that

1331
01:23:22,208 --> 01:23:23,416
 Invent new medicines...

1332
01:23:23,916 --> 01:23:25,750
...invent new treatments You get that?

1333
01:23:26,250 --> 01:23:26,916
 I don't know

1334
01:23:27,416 --> 01:23:28,750
 I understood, Prakash

1335
01:23:29,250 --> 01:23:31,583
I thought you will start an hospital for the poor...

1336
01:23:32,083 --> 01:23:33,500
 ..in this village

1337
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,666
 But Grandpa..I have signed a bond

1338
01:23:37,166 --> 01:23:39,250
 Have you signed a bond?

1339
01:23:39,750 --> 01:23:45,791
What can I say now? Do What you like

1340
01:23:46,291 --> 01:23:48,333

1341
01:23:48,833 --> 01:23:51,166
 Play your turn

1342
01:23:51,666 --> 01:23:52,458
 What did you say?

1343
01:23:52,958 --> 01:23:55,083
 Hey...what happened to you?

1344
01:23:55,583 --> 01:23:57,041

01:23:57,541 --> 01:24:00,125

1346

 ...at the Medical Research Centre

1355
01:24:23,916 --> 01:24:27,875
Uncle..I wasn't expecting this from your Prakash

1356
01:24:28,375 --> 01:24:30,458
No..this is not possible - What happened?

1357
01:24:30,958 --> 01:24:32,833
 Prakash..cannot do this

1358
01:24:33,333 --> 01:24:36,833
Doctor... - Uncle..

1359
01:24:48,625 --> 01:24:50,708
Did you take a degree from abroad...

1360
01:24:51,208 --> 01:24:52,833
...just to work here? - Excuse me?

1361
01:24:53,333 --> 01:24:54,833
Is it alright...if you sell this knowledge...

1362
01:24:55,333 --> 01:24:57,291
...so that you are paid.. three thousand Rupees a month?

1363
01:24:57,791 --> 01:25:00,333
Who are you? - I am a Doctor too

1364
01:25:00,833 --> 01:25:02,333
I am not as good as you... but still...

1365
01:25:02,833 --> 01:25:04,500
..I would like to tell you something

1366
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:09,041
 Come with me

1367
01:25:09,541 --> 01:25:13,041
 Come...be seated

1368
01:25:14,208 --> 01:25:14,708
 Tell me

1369
01:25:15,208 --> 01:25:16,375
 Look son...

1370
01:25:16,875 --> 01:25:20,208
... a Doctor's life is not just to earn money..

1371
01:25:20,708 --> 01:25:23,291
...they should serve the poor and the ill

1372
01:25:23,791 --> 01:25:25,250
 But...what are you trying to say?

1373
01:25:25,750 --> 01:25:29,250
 I want to tell you many things

1374
01:25:32,208 --> 01:25:35,791
Look son...there is a small village

1375
01:25:36,291 --> 01:25:40,458
I had started a dispensary there... twenty-five years back

1376
01:25:40,958 --> 01:25:44,958
I was fresh out of the medical school

1377
01:25:45,458 --> 01:25:48,583
I too could have earned money staying in the city

1378
01:25:49,083 --> 01:25:51,458
 But son...money isn't everything

1379
01:25:51,958 --> 01:25:53,833
The people in villages suffer from various illnesses

1380
01:25:54,333 --> 01:25:57,541
They die..but there is no one to treat them

1381
01:25:58,041 --> 01:26:00,958
The villagers have no means for their treatment

1382
01:26:01,458 --> 01:26:02,083
 They are helpless

1383
01:26:02,583 --> 01:26:04,500
You know the helplessness of the sick villagers..

1384
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:08,458
 ..as you too were born in a village

1385
01:26:08,958 --> 01:26:12,458
 How do you know that?

1386
01:26:13,916 --> 01:26:18,416
No Son... I know your family very well

1387
01:26:18,916 --> 01:26:19,583
 Ohh! I see.

1388
01:26:20,083 --> 01:26:21,708
I thought...the way you have been talking to me...

1389
01:26:22,208 --> 01:26:25,708
 ..I thought you know me very well

1390
01:26:27,541 --> 01:26:28,458
 Hello.

1391
01:26:28,958 --> 01:26:29,291
 Yes Sir.

1392
01:26:29,791 --> 01:26:30,541
 I will be right there

1393
01:26:31,041 --> 01:26:33,041
I will have to go - Sure

1394
01:26:33,541 --> 01:26:35,958
Look...don't feel offended...

1395
01:26:36,458 --> 01:26:38,375
 ...I said too many things to you

1396
01:26:38,875 --> 01:26:41,291
No...I like whatever you told me - Is it?

1397
01:26:41,791 --> 01:26:44,000
I would like to meet you again... if you could spare some time

1398
01:26:44,500 --> 01:26:46,916
 Yes...tell me when can I come next?

1399
01:26:47,416 --> 01:26:48,375
 You don't have to bother...

1400
01:26:48,875 --> 01:26:49,625
 Write down your address...

1401
01:26:50,125 --> 01:26:52,333
 ..I will meet you tomorrow evening

1402
01:26:52,833 --> 01:26:56,333
Tommorow evening? - Yes - Alright

1403
01:27:01,875 --> 01:27:02,666
Sister, I am going to play the match

1404
01:27:03,166 --> 01:27:03,833
 Alright ...go

1405
01:27:04,333 --> 01:27:05,166
 Wow.

Are you going to a friend's wedding?

1407
01:27:10,541 --> 01:27:12,375
A movie? - Wrong

1408
01:27:12,875 --> 01:27:13,791
 Then why are you decked up?

1409
01:27:14,291 --> 01:27:16,333
Can't I wear good clothes at home?

1410
01:27:16,833 --> 01:27:17,083
 Why not?

1411
01:27:17,583 --> 01:27:20,250
Go and play...I am in mood to wear good clothes

1412
01:27:20,750 --> 01:27:23,250
 Mood? all of a sudden?

1413
01:27:23,750 --> 01:27:27,041
 Wait a minute. Let me think.

1414
01:27:27,541 --> 01:27:30,000
 Doctor Uncle had come yesterday...

1415
01:27:30,500 --> 01:27:33,625
...and Mr. Nal is coming in today isn't it?

1416
01:27:34,125 --> 01:27:36,458
Chandu...you will be having beatings - I am not interested

1417
01:27:36,958 --> 01:27:38,333
 I will have food at nine

1418
01:27:38,833 --> 01:27:42,208
Sister...why don't you ask Doctor Uncle to talk to father?

1419
01:27:42,708 --> 01:27:45,041
What should he talk? - Whatever is in your mind

1420
01:27:45,541 --> 01:27:47,708
I will show you what is in my mind Wait - Oh my God

1421
01:27:48,208 --> 01:27:50,041

 I will teach you a lesson...

1423
01:27:51,583 --> 01:27:55,083
 ..when you come back in the evening

1424
01:27:58,041 --> 01:28:01,541

1425
01:28:05,041 --> 01:28:08,250

My sister is mad at me - Is it?

01:28:43,416 --> 01:28:44,166
 She has closed the door...

1437
01:28:44,666 --> 01:28:45,291

 It's me...Dr. Prakash

...who has come from the heaven to this earth

1487
01:30:41,041 --> 01:30:43,416
What are you saying? - I am telling the truth

1488
01:30:43,916 --> 01:30:45,083

I was afraid if you would like my ideas - What are you saying?

1505
01:31:31,833 --> 01:31:33,500
Your ideas have taught me something new

1506
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:35,541
A Doctor's life is not for himself...

1507
01:31:36,041 --> 01:31:36,916
...but for others - Yes

1508
01:31:37,416 --> 01:31:40,750

1509
01:31:41,250 --> 01:31:44,750

01:31:58,333 --> 01:32:00,208
I was telling him things about my village

1515
01:32:00,708 --> 01:32:04,000

1516

 But...what shall I talk to you?

1521
01:32:24,666 --> 01:32:27,375
Hey...haven't you learned this abroad...

1522
01:32:27,875 --> 01:32:31,291

01:32:31,791 --> 01:32:32,791
Excuse me? - Yes

1524
01:32:33,291 --> 01:32:35,125
 Have you recognised me?

1525
01:32:35,625 --> 01:32:37,500
 I feel I have seen you somewhere

1526
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:38,875
Don't you? - Yes

1527
01:32:39,375 --> 01:32:39,625

01:32:41,916 --> 01:32:44,166

01:32:44,666 --> 01:32:46,250
Hurray...I have defeated Pappadwala

1531
01:32:46,750 --> 01:32:48,083

01:32:49,625 --> 01:32:52,166
Congratulations! - Hello Gentleman!

1534
01:32:52,666 --> 01:32:53,666

01:32:54,166 --> 01:32:55,791
...and you are still safe - What?

1536
01:32:56,291 --> 01:32:57,541
 Chandu..this is Dr. Prakash

1537
01:32:58,041 --> 01:32:59,291
 Oh! No! What a joke!

1538
01:32:59,791 --> 01:33:01,500
I had asked him to be Dr.Prakash

1539
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:02,625
 He is Dr. Prakash for real

1540
01:33:03,125 --> 01:33:04,458
 Impossible!

1541
01:33:04,958 --> 01:33:07,166
His face doesn't match with the photo

1542
01:33:07,666 --> 01:33:09,166
Whose photo? - King Nal

1543
01:33:09,666 --> 01:33:10,750
Will bring it right away... - Wait

1544
01:33:11,250 --> 01:33:14,333
The same play..where you played Damayanti, is it?

1545
01:33:14,833 --> 01:33:17,083
Between the pages of 36 and 37... in her Chemistry book..

1546
01:33:17,583 --> 01:33:18,916
 ... is your photo

1547
01:33:19,416 --> 01:33:19,541
 Give him one slap!

1548
01:33:20,041 --> 01:33:21,541
 Why get mad at him?

1549
01:33:22,041 --> 01:33:25,916
He lies too much - But I think he is telling the truth

1550
01:33:26,416 --> 01:33:27,541
 Isn't he telling the truth?

1551
01:33:28,041 --> 01:33:31,500
Sister...please see if this is right? - I will not

1552
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:32,958
 Please.

1553
01:33:33,458 --> 01:33:35,000
Why did you misbehave in the presence of Dr. Prakash?

1554
01:33:35,500 --> 01:33:36,291
 What would he think?

1555
01:33:36,791 --> 01:33:40,416
What will he think? Shall I call him and ask?

1556
01:33:40,916 --> 01:33:44,416
That's your wish... you can do if you want to

1557
01:33:55,625 --> 01:33:55,916
 Hello!

1558
01:33:56,416 --> 01:33:56,791

01:34:04,333 --> 01:34:06,375
 Chandu...what is it?

No..I am not - No?

1566
01:34:11,291 --> 01:34:13,833

I said I won't talk - Wont talk?

1569
01:34:19,666 --> 01:34:22,916
Sister..says that she will not speak to you

1570
01:34:23,416 --> 01:34:24,208
 Why did you hang up?

1571
01:34:24,708 --> 01:34:25,791
And why did you say that I will not talk?

1572
01:34:26,291 --> 01:34:27,500
 You said you didn't wanted to talk

1573
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,166
 Go away... fool

1574
01:34:30,666 --> 01:34:34,166
 She yells at me for no reason

1575
01:34:52,625 --> 01:34:52,958
 Hello!

1576
01:34:53,458 --> 01:34:54,458
 Hello! Dr. Prakash?

01:34:54,958 --> 01:34:56,375
 Yes speaking..who are you?

I love you - Love me? What are you saying?

1580

I mean..don't you know any girl who loves you?

1581
01:35:08,458 --> 01:35:11,083
No...I don't know of any girl who loves me

1582
01:35:11,583 --> 01:35:13,375
 ..and I too don't love any girl

1583
01:35:13,875 --> 01:35:15,875
 Thank God!..I just wanted to know this

1584
01:35:16,375 --> 01:35:17,666
 Now I can sleep peacefully...

1585
01:35:18,166 --> 01:35:20,291
 ...you too should sleep peacefully

1586
01:35:20,791 --> 01:35:24,291
 Has he hung up?

1587

Listen - Yes

1588
01:35:33,791 --> 01:35:34,708

 Thank you

1591
01:35:47,583 --> 01:35:51,416

Experiment. - Experiment?

 What are you experimenting?

1596
01:36:03,250 --> 01:36:05,333
That...this tube has a love of a boy...

1597
01:36:05,833 --> 01:36:07,208
...and this tube has the love of a girl

1598
01:36:07,708 --> 01:36:09,916
I want to see what happens if they are mixed

1599
01:36:10,416 --> 01:36:11,375
 What will happen?

1600
01:36:11,875 --> 01:36:12,208

 You ruined my experiment

1604
01:36:18,291 --> 01:36:20,291
Everything will be ruined if you do wrong things at the wrong time

1605
01:36:20,791 --> 01:36:22,541
Is it? What else should I do at this hour?

1606

At this time...its six... you should love someone at this time

 Hello!

 Aren't you feeling sleepy?

1617
01:36:55,416 --> 01:36:57,500
Who are you? You call me everytime..

1618
01:36:58,000 --> 01:36:59,916
I am Kiran's childhood friend

1619
01:37:00,416 --> 01:37:01,458
 I stay opposite to her

1620
01:37:01,958 --> 01:37:04,958
Yes..but what is the purpose of calling me and harassing me always?

1621
01:37:05,458 --> 01:37:10,458
It's nothing...I just want you to know my friend

1622
01:37:10,958 --> 01:37:13,625
How do you know about Kiran's heart?

1623
01:37:14,125 --> 01:37:15,375
 She hides nothing to me

1624
01:37:15,875 --> 01:37:17,125
 The things is that...

1625
01:37:17,625 --> 01:37:19,166
 ...Kiran loves you a lot

1626
01:37:19,666 --> 01:37:20,958
 Have you lost your brains?

1627
01:37:21,458 --> 01:37:22,666
 It's the matter of hearts...

1628
01:37:23,166 --> 01:37:24,250
 ..and you are talking about brains

1629
01:37:24,750 --> 01:37:29,208
Look...I have no interest in falling for matters of the heart

1630
01:37:29,708 --> 01:37:31,166
 What shall I tell my friend?

1631
01:37:31,666 --> 01:37:33,541
 Say that...I do not like...

1632
01:37:34,041 --> 01:37:37,541
..such ultra-modern... crazy and insane girls - Quiet

1633
01:37:48,250 --> 01:37:50,125
You? - Thank God you have come during the day

1634
01:37:50,625 --> 01:37:51,708
You must have come here with an excuse

1635
01:37:52,208 --> 01:37:53,166
Go on - Not you...

1636
01:37:53,666 --> 01:37:54,708
..but I am here to meet Dr. Deepak

1637
01:37:55,208 --> 01:37:56,333
uncle has gone back to the village

1638
01:37:56,833 --> 01:37:57,750
But I wanted to tell him...that I...

1639
01:37:58,250 --> 01:37:58,875
..am coming to the village on Sunday

1640
01:37:59,375 --> 01:37:59,875
On Sunday? - Yes

1641
01:38:00,375 --> 01:38:01,708
You can go to the village and tell this

1642
01:38:02,208 --> 01:38:02,666
 Why are you standing here?

1643
01:38:03,166 --> 01:38:03,500
 You are a weird girl

1644
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:05,375
You behave like this... to someone who has come to your house...

1645
01:38:05,875 --> 01:38:07,250
 Don't you have manners?

1646
01:38:07,750 --> 01:38:08,208
 What can I do?

1647
01:38:08,708 --> 01:38:10,750
I am a crazy...insane and modern girl

1648
01:38:11,250 --> 01:38:14,500
Oh...you have got the news - Yes..

1649
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:18,125
..and now you know that I have no manners, I am ill-mannered

1650
01:38:18,625 --> 01:38:23,583
 Look...you can go from here

1651
01:38:24,083 --> 01:38:25,583
 What a blast!

1652
01:38:26,083 --> 01:38:27,416
 I am really sorry Dr. Prakash.

1653
01:38:27,916 --> 01:38:28,750
 I feel pity for you

1654
01:38:29,250 --> 01:38:31,125
 Chandan...tell me something...

1655
01:38:31,625 --> 01:38:33,041
...does your sister have a best friend?

1656
01:38:33,541 --> 01:38:33,875
 Why not?

1657
01:38:34,375 --> 01:38:36,125
Kala Gupta..she is eighteen years old...

1658
01:38:36,625 --> 01:38:38,500
...she is beautiful...and still unmarried

1659
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:41,083
The one who stays in the house right there?

1660
01:38:41,583 --> 01:38:42,375
 That is a maternity home

1661
01:38:42,875 --> 01:38:44,625
Is it a maternity home? - Yes

1662
01:38:45,125 --> 01:38:46,750
But what is the matter? -Your sister...

1663
01:38:47,250 --> 01:38:48,375
 Nothing... I will make a move

1664
01:38:48,875 --> 01:38:52,375
Sister...must have fooled him Sister...

1665
01:39:09,500 --> 01:39:11,541
Here... - I don't want money - Why?

1666
01:39:12,041 --> 01:39:15,541
Because you are Doctor's guest - Is it?

1667
01:39:23,041 --> 01:39:25,416
Who are you looking for? Doctor isn't home

1668
01:39:25,916 --> 01:39:27,416
When will he come? - God knows

1669
01:39:27,916 --> 01:39:28,500
 He will come some time

1670
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:33,708
Oh God!...will he go elsewhere.. if not his home?

1671
01:39:34,208 --> 01:39:37,708
Are you his wife? - God!

1672
01:39:38,208 --> 01:39:40,250
Are your brains stuffed with cow dung?

1673
01:39:40,750 --> 01:39:42,041
Please forgive me I made a mistake

1674
01:39:42,541 --> 01:39:45,541
Mistake?...I very well know people from the city

1675
01:39:46,041 --> 01:39:48,083
You come into the house... seeing that I am alone..and you say...

1676
01:39:48,583 --> 01:39:49,625
 What are you saying?

1677
01:39:50,125 --> 01:39:51,500
 How dare you?

1679
01:39:55,666 --> 01:39:57,291
What kind of ill-mannerism is this? Boorish!

1680
01:39:57,791 --> 01:39:59,166
 And bow you call me boorish

1681
01:39:59,666 --> 01:40:00,750
You? - Yes it's me

1686
01:40:08,958 --> 01:40:10,958

01:40:27,541 --> 01:40:31,208
Why are you standing? Please sit

1695
01:40:31,708 --> 01:40:32,708
 Did you see my house?

1696
01:40:33,208 --> 01:40:34,250
 You have stayed abroad...

01:40:34,750 --> 01:40:36,250
..and are used to staying in the Palace

1698
01:40:36,750 --> 01:40:39,125
 Anyways...however the house is..

I didn't find anything unfamiliar here

1701
01:40:44,125 --> 01:40:47,500
 I am very happy...Prakash

1702
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,500

...looks like it's going to be a grand welcome

1725
01:41:47,041 --> 01:41:48,291
Again you are talking like a fool

1726
01:41:48,791 --> 01:41:51,708
It's a woman's duty to welcome and serve

1727
01:41:52,208 --> 01:41:55,000
Is it? - Yes

1728
01:41:55,500 --> 01:42:02,750

1744
01:44:17,083 --> 01:44:24,791
"The oceans of beauty..can make anyone crazy"

1745
01:44:25,291 --> 01:44:33,541
"The oceans of beauty..can make anyone crazy"

1746
01:44:34,041 --> 01:44:37,625
"Now that you have come into my heart, why don't you come into my life"

1747
01:44:38,125 --> 01:44:41,333
 "A life will find life"

1748
01:44:41,833 --> 01:44:45,958

"This story started with you... it will end with you"

1751
01:45:11,125 --> 01:45:14,041
Greetings Doctor - Where were you going?

1752
01:45:14,541 --> 01:45:15,916
I am going to take care of the fields

1753
01:45:16,416 --> 01:45:18,625
The sparrow have been eating up the fields

1754
01:45:19,125 --> 01:45:20,458
 You have lost your leg..

1755
01:45:20,958 --> 01:45:22,250
 If the wound gets severe...

1756
01:45:22,750 --> 01:45:24,458
...you may lose your life Get that?

1757
01:45:24,958 --> 01:45:25,833
 What can I do Doctor?

1758
01:45:26,333 --> 01:45:26,916
The crops are ready to be harvested...

1759
01:45:27,416 --> 01:45:28,625
 ...but there is no one to do it

1760
01:45:29,125 --> 01:45:33,958
 Go... go and do as you please

1761
01:45:34,458 --> 01:45:35,791
 What happened to him?

1762
01:45:36,291 --> 01:45:39,458
A small wound with a thorny iron string..

1763
01:45:39,958 --> 01:45:42,333
He treated it with cow dung and mud

1764
01:45:42,833 --> 01:45:43,583
 When he came to me with it...

1765
01:45:44,083 --> 01:45:45,500
 ...there was a gangrene already

1766
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:47,416
Gangrene? - Yes

1767
01:45:47,916 --> 01:45:51,541
 The leg had to be imputed

1768
01:45:52,041 --> 01:45:55,541
 Come

1769
01:45:57,708 --> 01:46:00,208

01:46:00,708 --> 01:46:02,583
...died suffering from cholera

1771
01:46:03,083 --> 01:46:05,125
 And she became crazy

1772
01:46:05,625 --> 01:46:09,125
 Come

1773
01:46:14,958 --> 01:46:17,541
He is in his last stage of tuberculosis

1774
01:46:18,041 --> 01:46:19,750
 When I got the news...

1775
01:46:20,250 --> 01:46:25,000
...this poor man was out of the reach of treatment

1776
01:46:25,500 --> 01:46:28,125
 His family member left him

1777
01:46:28,625 --> 01:46:32,125
He is waiting for his death now

1778
01:46:40,958 --> 01:46:41,666
 Come

1779
01:46:42,166 --> 01:46:43,041

01:46:52,500 --> 01:46:54,666
 They are in a very bad state

1783
01:46:55,166 --> 01:46:58,833
I have decided that I will come here...

1784
01:46:59,333 --> 01:47:00,708
 ...as soon as I finish my bond

1785
01:47:01,208 --> 01:47:04,500
I will serve the poor... along with you

1786
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:07,958
Is that true Prakash? - Yes

1787
01:47:08,458 --> 01:47:11,958
 I am very happy Prakash

1788
01:47:21,375 --> 01:47:23,875
 Kiran...whose picture is this?

1789
01:47:24,375 --> 01:47:28,708
 This is Aunt

1790
01:47:29,208 --> 01:47:33,333
On seeing her...I felt... - What did you feel Prakash?

1791
01:47:33,833 --> 01:47:37,500
Like I know her...I have seen her somewhere

1792
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,250
You have seen her? - Yes

1793
01:47:40,750 --> 01:47:42,625
 I haven't ever seen my mother...

1794
01:47:43,125 --> 01:47:46,333
...but I have vivid image of her in my mind

1795
01:47:46,833 --> 01:47:48,333
I feel...she must have been like this

1796
01:47:48,833 --> 01:47:55,583
Prakash...do you think of her as your mother? - Yes

1797
01:47:56,083 --> 01:48:02,416
 Prakash...think of her as your mother

1798
01:48:02,916 --> 01:48:05,291
 Kiran dear...

1799
01:48:05,791 --> 01:48:07,500
 What happened to him?

1800
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,791
 Uncle loved Aunt a lot

1801
01:48:11,291 --> 01:48:14,791
He made her tomb right here after her death

1802
01:48:31,750 --> 01:48:34,625
 Asha...do you know?

1803
01:48:35,125 --> 01:48:38,625
Prakash is here today Your Prakash

1804
01:48:53,791 --> 01:48:55,750
Give me your hand - Why?

1805
01:48:56,250 --> 01:48:59,541
 Give it

1806
01:49:00,041 --> 01:49:01,625
 What is this?

1807
01:49:02,125 --> 01:49:03,083
 So that you remember

1808
01:49:03,583 --> 01:49:05,125
 What should I remember?

1809
01:49:05,625 --> 01:49:07,375
That you have to talk to Grandpa

1810
01:49:07,875 --> 01:49:10,958
When you got to Grandpa and greet him

1811
01:49:11,458 --> 01:49:14,000
 You will remember when you see this

1812
01:49:14,500 --> 01:49:17,041
And you will tell Grandpa...that I love a...

1813
01:49:17,541 --> 01:49:20,875
Listen...I will think of you even without the ring

1814
01:49:21,375 --> 01:49:22,375
 You get that?

1815
01:49:22,875 --> 01:49:26,375
Really? - Yes

1816
01:49:29,208 --> 01:49:30,500
 Hey...listen

1817
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:31,958
Where are you taking me? - Train

1818
01:49:32,458 --> 01:49:38,333
The train is here...say up or down? - Up

1819
01:49:38,833 --> 01:49:40,125
What will you give me if I win?

1820
01:49:40,625 --> 01:49:41,791
Whatever you want.. and if it's a down..

1821
01:49:42,291 --> 01:49:43,916
...you have to give me whatever I want - I agree

1822
01:49:44,416 --> 01:49:47,458
 Let it be down

1823
01:49:47,958 --> 01:49:52,000
Let it be down...Oh God Lord Ganesh

1824
01:49:52,500 --> 01:49:54,458
 Let it be down

1825
01:49:54,958 --> 01:49:58,833
Let it be down..Lord Ganesh I will offer prayers

1826
01:49:59,333 --> 01:50:03,250
You lose - I lose...now what?

1827
01:50:03,750 --> 01:50:05,250
Turn around - Turn around...why?

1828
01:50:05,750 --> 01:50:08,250
 Turn around...don't look back...

1829
01:50:08,750 --> 01:50:11,791
..and don't listen either - Alright

1830
01:50:12,291 --> 01:50:16,583
What is this? - Don't turn...or look

1831
01:50:17,083 --> 01:50:20,291
Kiran..if this is the punishment if I lose..

1832
01:50:20,791 --> 01:50:24,291
 ...then I will lose all my life

1833
01:50:28,375 --> 01:50:30,041
 Prakash.

1834
01:50:30,541 --> 01:50:32,500
 Uncle

1835
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:35,833
 Prakash..it's time for your train, Son

1836
01:50:36,333 --> 01:50:38,750
Common...I am ready - Alright...come

1837
01:50:39,250 --> 01:50:42,750
 Come

1838
01:50:45,791 --> 01:50:47,958
Uncle...I am not capable as of now

1839
01:50:48,458 --> 01:50:52,250
 Bless me...that I become like you

1840
01:50:52,750 --> 01:50:54,166
 Hey...what are you doing son?

1841
01:50:54,666 --> 01:50:57,291
Now that you call me your son.. let me do my duties as a son

1842
01:50:57,791 --> 01:50:59,250
 Bless you

1843
01:50:59,750 --> 01:51:03,250
 I will leave, Kiran

1844
01:51:10,583 --> 01:51:13,166
 If you like the girl then it's ok.

1845
01:51:13,666 --> 01:51:15,083
 Why will I refuse?

1846
01:51:15,583 --> 01:51:18,250
But who is the girl? - Kiran

1847
01:51:18,750 --> 01:51:20,916
 That's a good pair

1848
01:51:21,416 --> 01:51:22,625
 Prakash (Light) and Kiran (sunrays)

1849
01:51:23,125 --> 01:51:25,833
 I was asking about her father?

1850
01:51:26,333 --> 01:51:28,166
 His name...family...caste..

1851
01:51:28,666 --> 01:51:30,583
 I don't know any of it...

1852
01:51:31,083 --> 01:51:32,708
 ...but his name is Mr. Rasiklal Verma

1853
01:51:33,208 --> 01:51:37,916
Verma?...which means they aren't Brahmins

1854
01:51:38,416 --> 01:51:40,916
Who cares about the caste these days?

1855
01:51:41,416 --> 01:51:42,750
 I do...son

1856
01:51:43,250 --> 01:51:46,333
 Marriage isn't for your happiness

1857
01:51:46,833 --> 01:51:48,875
Family and society too is important

1858
01:51:49,375 --> 01:51:52,333
But Grandpa..I am not getting married for the society

1859
01:51:52,833 --> 01:51:54,166
I am getting married for myself

1860
01:51:54,666 --> 01:51:58,791
There are good girls in the Brahmin community too

1861
01:51:59,291 --> 01:52:01,708
There must be...but what have I got to do with them?

1862
01:52:02,208 --> 01:52:05,250
What? - Sir..let it be

1863
01:52:05,750 --> 01:52:07,750
 Quiet Girdhari

1864
01:52:08,250 --> 01:52:10,166
 Listen to me carefully...Prakash...

1865
01:52:10,666 --> 01:52:11,916
 ..till the day I am alive...

1866
01:52:12,416 --> 01:52:15,708
...no girl from a different community can come into this house

1867
01:52:16,208 --> 01:52:22,000
Do you get that? - Grandpa..I have always obeyed you

1868
01:52:22,500 --> 01:52:23,875
But I will not be able to listen to you this time

1869
01:52:24,375 --> 01:52:27,166
Why not? - I will only get married to Kiran

1870
01:52:27,666 --> 01:52:29,458
 You...you cannot do that

1871
01:52:29,958 --> 01:52:31,833
 I will get married only to Kiran

1872
01:52:32,333 --> 01:52:33,625
 The same things are happening again

1873
01:52:34,125 --> 01:52:35,583
He too will...just like Munna

1874
01:52:36,083 --> 01:52:38,083
 You are responsible for this

1875
01:52:38,583 --> 01:52:42,916
I was patient...after throwing out my dear son out of this house

1876
01:52:43,416 --> 01:52:45,083
 Where did you bring him from?

1877
01:52:45,583 --> 01:52:48,833
You made him sit on the throne.. from the streets

1878
01:52:49,333 --> 01:52:51,000
Sir... - I too accepted him...

1879
01:52:51,500 --> 01:52:54,125
 ...coming into your talks

1880
01:52:54,625 --> 01:52:57,125
What did you say? Am I not the son of this house?

1881
01:52:57,625 --> 01:53:00,458
 No son...you belong to this house

1882
01:53:00,958 --> 01:53:04,125
 Tell me...who am I?

1883
01:53:04,625 --> 01:53:06,333
You don't need to know all of this

1884
01:53:06,833 --> 01:53:08,500
You should be the way you are

1885
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:13,458
I understand...my parents have no identity

1886
01:53:13,958 --> 01:53:16,250
You had brought me from the streets

1887
01:53:16,750 --> 01:53:20,708
You had pity on me... just to forget about you son...

1888
01:53:21,208 --> 01:53:21,916
 Isn't it?

1889
01:53:22,416 --> 01:53:24,208
 Why didn't you let me die?

1890
01:53:24,708 --> 01:53:27,166
Do you want to say that I did a sin...

1891
01:53:27,666 --> 01:53:28,833
 ...by bringing you up?

1892
01:53:29,333 --> 01:53:31,750
I don't know anything about good and bad deeds

1893
01:53:32,250 --> 01:53:34,541
 I was alone in this world...

1894
01:53:35,041 --> 01:53:36,333
 ..and I will always be alone

1895
01:53:36,833 --> 01:53:38,166
 This is my identity

1896
01:53:38,666 --> 01:53:41,875
I do not need your sympathies hereafter

1897
01:53:42,375 --> 01:53:44,250
 Raja babu...don't go..Stop

1898
01:53:44,750 --> 01:53:46,000
 Let him go...

1899
01:53:46,500 --> 01:53:49,416
 Sir stop him...call him back

1900
01:53:49,916 --> 01:53:52,500
This shouldn't happen - Let it happen

1901
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:53,875
 He will do whatever he wants...

1902
01:53:54,375 --> 01:53:55,583
...I will not be able to do anything

1903
01:53:56,083 --> 01:54:00,541
 How will I say...Sir?

1904
01:54:01,041 --> 01:54:03,041
Tell me something Girdhari - Yes

1905
01:54:03,541 --> 01:54:07,500
Does love...motherhood...has no value in this world?

1906
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:09,666
 Is everything a lie?

1907
01:54:10,166 --> 01:54:11,375
 Everything would be fine..Sir...

1908
01:54:11,875 --> 01:54:13,500
 Give me a little time

1909
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:17,500
 Everything would be fine

1910
01:54:31,333 --> 01:54:32,958
You?...when did you come back from the village?

1911
01:54:33,458 --> 01:54:35,125
 Come...come inside

1912
01:54:35,625 --> 01:54:37,000
Kiran - Yes

1913
01:54:37,500 --> 01:54:39,416
 I have come to say goodbye

1914
01:54:39,916 --> 01:54:40,958
 You should forget me

1915
01:54:41,458 --> 01:54:42,666
 What are you saying?

1916
01:54:43,166 --> 01:54:44,750
 I am right Kiran

1917
01:54:45,250 --> 01:54:46,541
 I have come to know today...

1918
01:54:47,041 --> 01:54:48,875
 ..that I have no identity

1919
01:54:49,375 --> 01:54:50,625
 Who are my parents?

1920
01:54:51,125 --> 01:54:52,250
 Which family do I belong to?

1921
01:54:52,750 --> 01:54:54,625
 I know nothing about it

1922
01:54:55,125 --> 01:54:59,625
Kiran...I am no longer eligible to get married to you

1923
01:55:00,125 --> 01:55:01,458
 But...

1924
01:55:01,958 --> 01:55:03,583
the girl's father should be worried...

1925
01:55:04,083 --> 01:55:06,083
...about the boy's eligibility... not the boy

1926
01:55:06,583 --> 01:55:09,041
Do you love Kiran? - Yes

1927
01:55:09,541 --> 01:55:11,583
Does Kiran love you? Say

1928
01:55:12,083 --> 01:55:13,083
 Yes

1929
01:55:13,583 --> 01:55:15,708
This means you are useless - Excuse me?

1930
01:55:16,208 --> 01:55:19,458
Yes... I wanted a useless boy like you...

1931
01:55:19,958 --> 01:55:22,125
...who values love and not the family

1932
01:55:22,625 --> 01:55:27,750
Bless you... listen.. I found a... - Bless you

1933
01:55:28,250 --> 01:55:32,000

1934
01:55:32,500 --> 01:55:34,541
 Here son...have sweets

1935
01:55:35,041 --> 01:55:36,125
You are giving me so much respect...

1936
01:55:36,625 --> 01:55:36,958
 ...even after knowing the truth

1937
01:55:37,458 --> 01:55:38,708
 You are misunderstanding

1938
01:55:39,208 --> 01:55:40,291
 This is just about marriage

1939
01:55:40,791 --> 01:55:41,541
You will only be respected in this house...

1940
01:55:42,041 --> 01:55:45,166
..lonely if you learn to play chess Get that?

1941
01:55:45,666 --> 01:55:49,166
What are you looking at? Common

1942
01:55:51,958 --> 01:55:53,583
What are you looking at? Eat

1943
01:55:54,083 --> 01:55:57,583
You have the sweets - Bless you

1944
01:56:13,916 --> 01:56:17,875
What is groom's father's name?

1945
01:56:18,375 --> 01:56:19,833
Why are you putting us in trouble, priest?

1946
01:56:20,333 --> 01:56:22,958
Take the name of the Creator... he is a father to all

1947
01:56:23,458 --> 01:56:26,208
How is that possible? - Alright

1948
01:56:26,708 --> 01:56:28,125
 I will tell you the father's name

1949
01:56:28,625 --> 01:56:29,875
 I will pay you extra money...

1950
01:56:30,375 --> 01:56:31,208
 ...get them married

1951
01:56:31,708 --> 01:56:32,625
 Forgive me Sir...

1952
01:56:33,125 --> 01:56:34,375
I cannot get them married... unless...

1953
01:56:34,875 --> 01:56:36,041
... I am not told the name of groom's father

1954
01:56:36,541 --> 01:56:40,541
Do you want to know his father's name?

1955
01:56:41,041 --> 01:56:43,416
Father's name is Pratap Narayan Rai Chaudhary

1956
01:56:43,916 --> 01:56:46,041
Grandfather's name is Pratap Narayan Rai Chaudhary

1957

 You?

1958
01:56:48,250 --> 01:56:51,541
You thought I would give up, isn't it?

1959
01:56:52,041 --> 01:56:54,500
He is... - He is the Zamindar of Haripur...

1960
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:57,291
 ...Mr. Pratap Narayan Rai Chaudhary

1961

start with the rituals..before the auspicious time passes

1965
01:57:06,041 --> 01:57:07,625
 Hey...bring a chair

1966
01:57:08,125 --> 01:57:11,791
Priest...now you know everything right?

1967
01:57:12,291 --> 01:57:13,666
 Let's begin

1968

01:57:28,250 --> 01:57:31,125
 Master has changed now Munna

1970
01:57:31,625 --> 01:57:35,458
He has organized a party to welcome the bride and the groom

1971
01:57:35,958 --> 01:57:38,250
Is it? - He called me and said..

1972
01:57:38,750 --> 01:57:42,750
...I am missing him on this happy occasion

1973
01:57:43,250 --> 01:57:47,583
Common dear...I am here to take you - No Uncle

1974
01:57:48,083 --> 01:57:50,416
This isn't possible anymore - Why not?

1975
01:57:50,916 --> 01:57:52,708
 Have you turned stone hearted?

1976
01:57:53,208 --> 01:57:56,000
Master is not going to live long

1977
01:57:56,500 --> 01:57:57,833
He is alive today...but he may not live tomorrow

1978
01:57:58,333 --> 01:58:00,375
Don't you want him to be happy at this age?

1979
01:58:00,875 --> 01:58:03,375
 No Uncle... don't say that...

1980
01:58:03,875 --> 01:58:06,166
 Try to understand...if I come back

1981
01:58:06,666 --> 01:58:10,583
...my meditation and practice will be of no use..

1982
01:58:11,083 --> 01:58:12,500
 Why will it be of no use?

1983
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:15,791
Wouldn't your wife would have gone to bless her son...

1984
01:58:16,291 --> 01:58:16,958
 ..if she was alive?

1985
01:58:17,458 --> 01:58:19,250
 You have to do all her duties

1986
01:58:19,750 --> 01:58:22,791
..or her soul wouldn't rest in peace - No Uncle

1987
01:58:23,291 --> 01:58:26,083
 Don't say that Uncle

1988
01:58:26,583 --> 01:58:30,333
 What if someone recognizes me?

1989
01:58:30,833 --> 01:58:31,625
 Who will recognise you?

1990
01:58:32,125 --> 01:58:33,583
You have been staying away for so many years

1991
01:58:34,083 --> 01:58:35,166
 You have changed

1992
01:58:35,666 --> 01:58:36,250
 No one will recognise you

1993
01:58:36,750 --> 01:58:40,875
 Don't be stubborn...come

1994
01:58:41,375 --> 01:58:44,875
 Asha

1995
01:59:05,041 --> 01:59:08,166
Munna how do you feel? Isn't it good?

1996
01:59:08,666 --> 01:59:12,166
 Come

1997
01:59:25,958 --> 01:59:26,791
Girdhari Uncle - What is it?

1998
01:59:27,291 --> 01:59:28,333
Where were you? Master was looking for you

1999
01:59:28,833 --> 01:59:29,791
You should go to him soon - Alright

2000
01:59:30,291 --> 01:59:32,125
 Come

2001
01:59:32,625 --> 01:59:36,875
 No uncle..you go

2002
01:59:37,375 --> 01:59:40,791
Alright... the bride and grooms room is right there.. - Alright

2003
01:59:41,291 --> 01:59:44,791
You go...I will be back - Alright

2004
02:00:09,041 --> 02:00:10,541
 Bless you...

2005
02:00:11,041 --> 02:00:13,208
 Prakash I just met your grandfather

2006
02:00:13,708 --> 02:00:17,000
He is a big hearted man... I am very pleased

2007
02:00:17,500 --> 02:00:19,500
Listen...com here - What happened?

2008
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:22,958
Why are you sitting between the ladies? Go out

2009
02:00:23,458 --> 02:00:26,958
 Oh!...the ladies?

2010
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:31,500
 What happened next?

2011
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:33,500
 Here... you can start

2012
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:34,541
 What is this for?

2013
02:00:35,041 --> 02:00:38,000
You will be singing now - Yes...please sing a song

2014
02:00:38,500 --> 02:00:42,000
 I do not know to sing

2015
02:00:46,291 --> 02:00:49,791
 Bring the sweets

2016
02:01:10,750 --> 02:01:12,791
Gopinath.. - Yes Sir

2017
02:01:13,291 --> 02:01:15,458
I hope all the arrangements are done? - Yes Sir

2018
02:01:15,958 --> 02:01:19,458
 Do take care of the guests

2019
02:02:14,083 --> 02:02:17,000
 I want all your blessings

2020
02:02:17,500 --> 02:02:21,125
My generation is coming to an end

2021
02:02:21,625 --> 02:02:26,166
I don't know...whatever I did is right or wrong..

2022
02:02:26,666 --> 02:02:28,916
..I want this family to be taken ahead

2023
02:02:29,416 --> 02:02:32,500
..and so I have accepted everything

2024
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:37,625
You all should bless the bride and the groom

2025
02:02:38,125 --> 02:02:42,000
The injustice that I did.. by sending my son away...

2026
02:02:42,500 --> 02:02:45,250
 ..I am propitiating for the same

2027
02:02:45,750 --> 02:02:47,208
 I wish my son was here

2028
02:02:47,708 --> 02:02:52,458
He could have seen... I have changed a lot

2029
02:02:52,958 --> 02:02:57,500
Father - Who is that?

2030
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:00,583
 Who is it?

2031
02:03:01,083 --> 02:03:05,125
 Who called me?

2032
02:03:05,625 --> 02:03:08,875
 Who called me?

2033
02:03:09,375 --> 02:03:12,958
 Girdhari

2034
02:03:13,458 --> 02:03:15,083
Who are you? Why have you come here?

2035
02:03:15,583 --> 02:03:17,750
Girdhari - What happened, Master?

2036
02:03:18,250 --> 02:03:20,041
 I felt that...

2037
02:03:20,541 --> 02:03:21,625
 Hey listen... who are you?

2038
02:03:22,125 --> 02:03:22,916
 Who do you want to meet?

2039
02:03:23,416 --> 02:03:25,375
 No one...let me go

2040
02:03:25,875 --> 02:03:28,416

Uncle...is that you? - Look son..

Why are you creating a chaos? He is my uncle - Uncle?

Uncle...why are you going? - No - Bless you Doctor

Listen.. - What is the commotion?

2055
02:04:03,291 --> 02:04:04,833

Girdhari Uncle...let me go - No...how can you go?

I have to go - Girdhari Uncle...what's happening?

2071
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:09,708

 What could I do master?

Munna had bonded me with a promise

2081
02:05:55,250 --> 02:06:00,416
I understand son...please forgive me

2082
02:06:00,916 --> 02:06:03,833
I have hurt you a lot - What are you saying, father?
