3
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:24,750
I'll fly away in an airplane

4
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:27,410
You won't be able to catch me

5
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:53,010
I'll signal to you from far away
and make you yearn for me

6
00:02:53,540 --> 00:03:00,720
I'll look at you from the moon
and then hide myself

7
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:30,410
On long and difficult paths...

8
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,200
streets and markets

9
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:54,150
My wheel speeds like a motorcar

10
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:59,310
The world speeds by

11
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:11,580
The sun goes by and so does the moon

12
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:17,420
A play of light and darkness

13
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,850
The world runs behind me...

14
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:25,980
while I move ahead

15
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:35,610
I'll hold your hand
and take you far away

16
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:40,780
You won't be able to
get hold of me

17
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:49,346
I'll fly away in an airplane

18
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:51,970
You won't be able to catch me

19
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:02,320
Get down, dear. Boss will be
going to the party.

20
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:05,560
I won't. Come, Chander,
you, too, should accompany us.

21
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:09,850
- Come down, Lata. I'm getting late.
- No, I will accompany you.

22
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:15,160
- Children don't attend parties.
- Then why is mother going with you?

23
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,830
I am not going.
Come on, come down.

24
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:20,900
No, father.
I will accompany you.

25
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:27,410
You're such a nice girl. I, too,
get you whatever you ask for.

26
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:32,270
Didn't I get you a toy cat
which made sounds when pressed?

27
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:35,230
What would you like
to have today? Tell me!

28
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:38,816
All right.
Give me this watch.

29
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,580
- All right.
- Why're you insisting? Come down.

30
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:44,320
Don't say anything now.
Here, take it.

31
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:50,090
Come on, Chander. Let's play.
It's such a nice watch.

32
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:53,150
No, go with your mother.

33
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:57,800
Come here.
Come on, come here

34
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:15,460
What say? If you're seen around,
I will beat you.

35
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,670
Come on. Get lost.

36
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,640
Let's go.

37
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,460
Mother, get me a watch.

38
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,440
Just a while ago, Lata's father
gave her such a nice watch.

39
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,296
Where would I get you one?

40
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:57,900
Mother, if you don't get me one,
who else will?

41
00:06:58,510 --> 00:06:59,910
I want a watch!

42
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,590
- What's this?
- It's wheat.

43
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,460
What's it used for?

44
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:10,380
Do you think I'm a child?
You sell wheat flour.

45
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:15,870
- What becomes of the wheat flour?
- You bake bread and we eat it.

46
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:24,460
You're right. If we don't eat bread,
we can't survive.

47
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:28,780
But one can survive
without a watch.

48
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:34,090
- Mother, why do people wear a watch?
- Not everybody...

49
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:39,650
Only the fortunate ones
can own a gold watch.

50
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:45,320
Your father, too,
had a gold watch.

51
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:47,090
Give me that one.

52
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:53,030
- That one...
- What happened to it?

53
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:58,590
That watch got crushed in
the form of wheat-flour...

54
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:03,890
and consumed by us
in the form of a bread.

55
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:15,090
You used to say he'd
surely return one day.

56
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:23,930
Son, let me tell you
truthfully today.

57
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,980
Your father was taken away by God.

58
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:34,790
God left you behind with me
as a reminder of your father.

59
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:44,200
And I wonder why God has
left me behind.

60
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:53,090
I think about it for hours.
But I can't understand anything.

61
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,576
Son...

62
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,900
Ladies and gentlemen...

63
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:03,750
I feel so sad to
inform you that...

64
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:08,620
our dear Deputy has been
transferred to Bombay.

65
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,060
To tell you the truth...

66
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:18,980
there hasn't been a better
supporter of us poor people.

67
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:25,480
We sincerely pray that wherever
he lives, he should be happy.

68
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:34,960
I am so thankful for the love
of all you people.

69
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:39,990
I am truly saddened
to be distanced from you.

70
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:49,320
Who knows, I might get an opportunity
to serve you all once again.

71
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:57,720
I once again thank all of you.

72
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,560
- Where is Lata?
- I don't know.

73
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:18,126
Just check. She must be
playing there with Chander.

74
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:20,490
Go and fetch her quickly.
It's time for the train.

75
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:21,850
All right.

76
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:35,430
- We're leaving for Bombay.
- Why?

77
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:38,030
Father says we've
been transferred to Bombay.

78
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,110
- When will you return, Lata?
- Mother says we won't come back.

79
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:45,300
- Then when will we meet?
- When you come there.

80
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,890
- With whom will I come?
- With your father.

81
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:55,940
I told mother yesterday
to write a letter to father...

82
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:58,150
and get me a watch
like Lata has.

83
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:02,770
But she said that he can't
get one. Neither can he come.

84
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,440
- Where is he?
- In God's home.

85
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,480
- God doesn't let my father come.
- If you like my watch, take it.

86
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:14,790
- What will you do, then?
- My father will get me another.

87
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,180
Here, take it.

88
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:21,200
Whenever I feel like playing with you,
I'll play with your watch.

89
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:24,060
Wait, Lata. Let me also
give you something.

90
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,880
Dear, the train is ready. Everybody
is getting angry. Come on.

91
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,760
- Wait, I'm coming.
- We'll all leave you..

92
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,690
You'll be left alone. Here I go.

93
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:42,800
Wait, I'm coming.

94
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:04,010
Lata! Lata!

95
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:46,290
The toy has broken, my child.
It's broken

96
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,550
Your life is full of sorrows

97
00:12:57,390 --> 00:13:00,070
The toy has broken

98
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:08,280
Everything is in god's hands

99
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:13,350
We are mere puppets

100
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:20,220
All of us are like toys,
good and bad

101
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,740
Go ahead. Buy the toys

102
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:28,400
They are better than people

103
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:33,890
Buy an idol of god,
buy a map of India

104
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:36,620
This is from Japan

105
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,400
This is Lallu, this is Gyan

106
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:42,480
This is Kallu, this is Pran

107
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:47,790
Why are you crying Chandrabhan?

108
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:53,620
Don't cry, my child!
You are a son of the motherland

109
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:58,920
Buy a bow and arrow

110
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:05,410
Buy some cigarettes and 'paan'

111
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:12,230
My toys cost only two annas.
Go ahead kids. Buy them

112
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:17,890
There are paper-made toys, too,
which don't break easily

113
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:30,590
The toy has broken, my child.
It's broken

114
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:33,720
Your life is full of sorrows

115
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:39,210
The toy has broken

116
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:44,830
Everything is in god's hands

117
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:49,980
We are mere puppets

118
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,970
- Where were you, son?
- Lata has left.

119
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:09,320
I'm asking you where you were.

120
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:12,140
I was sitting and staring
at the places...

121
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,670
where I used to play with Lata.

122
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:18,750
- Why are you wasting time?
- Why did Lata go away, mother?

123
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:21,950
How can big and small be together?

124
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:25,620
Lata isn't big.
She's my own age.

125
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:27,880
She's as old as you.

126
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:33,190
But she was born into
an affluent family.

127
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,030
And she'll be married
to a wealthy man.

128
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:42,990
- Mother, won't I ever see her again?
- Why not? You surely can.

129
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,700
But to meet Lata,
you'll have to study...

130
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:49,820
- and do some very good work.
- I'll study hard, mother.

131
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,350
I'll do everything so
I can see Lata again.

132
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,320
May God make it happen.

133
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:01,770
Come, eat food now.

134
00:17:57,490 --> 00:18:02,040
Renu, such an enchanting name!

135
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,170
She writes equally well.

136
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:10,120
But how did you know about Chander
and Lata's childhood events?

137
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,320
I'll have to ask you that
when I visit you in Bombay.

138
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:19,130
In Bombay I'll have to search
for you and someone else, too.

139
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:23,950
Search for whom, you might ask?
Lata, I would answer.

140
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:25,730
And who's Lata?

141
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,480
There was a girl.

142
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:40,650
Why are the memories of the past
coming back to me?

143
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:46,500
Sorrowful tales...

144
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:50,280
and sad melodies

145
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:55,530
Why are they playing?

146
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:59,760
Why are they haunting me?

147
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:29,510
My smiling face..

148
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:35,800
Hides many tears

149
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:44,700
Why are the memories of the past
coming back to me?

150
00:19:56,380 --> 00:20:01,830
I wonder why I can't forget...

151
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:05,760
the people of my past

152
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:22,900
I can't stop the melancholy
churning within

153
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:29,930
I'm like a fire..

154
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:38,840
Whose flame is dying out

155
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:47,340
Why are the memories of the past
coming back to me?

156
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:04,440
I tried a lot, but Chander
couldn't study very much.

157
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,550
Now he's become fond
of making sitars.

158
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:15,050
I wanted him to be educated
and become an inspector.

159
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:19,140
You, too, used to be
known as the constable.

160
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:22,840
You too were so fond of
playing sitar.

161
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:31,010
Remember, you used to say that
a skill is far better than a job.

162
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:36,330
May God bring him success
in this field.

163
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:40,040
And may your name become glorious.

164
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:57,270
Eat your meal, dear.
What are you thinking?

165
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,910
- Nothing.
- You're surely thinking something.

166
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:06,450
Mother, shall I go to Bombay?

167
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:09,420
Bombay? What made you think
of going to Bombay?

168
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:13,590
Come on, eat your meal now.
Who will give you food there?

169
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:16,540
- I am not a child, mother.
- Of course not.

170
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:19,820
Open your mouth.
Open.

171
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:23,900
You can't even eat food yourself.
And you want to go to Bombay.

172
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:25,830
Here...

173
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:31,600
Here, take more.

174
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:44,940
- Yes?
- Is it ready?

175
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:50,140
- But I don't make knives.
- I mean, is my sitar ready or...?

176
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,226
- There's still more to do.
- You've been saying that for six months.

177
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:55,580
- You seem to be an idiot.
- What did you say?

178
00:22:56,300 --> 00:23:00,520
What's six months? It might take
fifteen years to do it properly.

179
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:05,380
Return it to me untuned. It might
not get tuned even in this lifetime.

180
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:08,830
That too is possible. There's
your sitar. You may take it away.

181
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:13,050
How wonderful! This is
how business should be.

182
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:16,710
It takes fifteen years to tune a sitar...

183
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:19,370
or maybe you just haven't learned
how to tune a sitar?

184
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:21,890
Prakash! When did you
come from Bombay?

185
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:26,980
I wrote dozens of letters.
But you didn't reply to any.

186
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:29,230
I've only come to
meet your mother.

187
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:33,120
Why are you getting angry?
I couldn't find time to reply.

188
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:40,400
I can see that. You didn't even
make one sitar in six months!

189
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:43,680
You really are wasting your time.

190
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:50,250
Times are such that artists
don't have any future.

191
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:54,390
This desolate Jehanabad
has no admirers.

192
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,480
I've written a thousand times
to come to Bombay...

193
00:23:56,820 --> 00:24:00,070
invest as much money as you like,
and open a shop. I've no objections.

194
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:04,130
But you're one of those who
prefers to lead the same life.

195
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:08,640
A lot of your life
has already been spent.

196
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,130
Some of it remains.
That too will pass away.

197
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:15,720
You're prepared to die here.
But not to go to Bombay.

198
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:18,470
It's possible that we poor people
might not like...

199
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:21,140
the affluent atmosphere
of your Bombay city.

200
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,380
You aren't too educated.
You developed a liking for sitar.

201
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:30,710
In this too, you can't even tune
a sitar even after six months?

202
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,360
I'll have you make a decision
before I leave. Either here or there.

203
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:38,760
It's better if you shift your
attention that way.

204
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:41,640
My decision is dependent
on my mother's decision.

205
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:44,520
Really? So be it, then.

206
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:53,570
Greetings, mother.

207
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:58,900
Bless you, dear.
When did you come, Prakash?

208
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:02,320
I've just arrived. I haven't seen
you for a long time.

209
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:05,550
- So I came over to meet you.
- Bless you.

210
00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:08,300
May you make more progress in life.

211
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:10,160
You should also pray that...

212
00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:12,550
I don't have to see you
in such a condition again.

213
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:18,680
There are mostly poor people
living in this world.

214
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:26,540
If not here, your eyes might have
to see such sights elsewhere.

215
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:30,190
Why do you ask for prayers...

216
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:36,970
which God never paid heed to
after creating this world?

217
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:40,460
I can't bear to see you
in this condition.

218
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:43,830
Instead of explaining to me...

219
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:49,020
Do you hear, Chander?

220
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:52,340
I've been hearing this forever.

221
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:55,890
But the world is so cruel. It doesn't
allow any opportunity to understand.

222
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,630
I don't want to hear such
timid statements.

223
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:04,210
I can't bear to see
your mother's condition.

224
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:08,650
A mother who never let her
miseries be known to you...

225
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:11,680
a mother who spent her whole
life at the grinding the stone...

226
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:15,290
and you never allowed these weak
and pure hands to rest.

227
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:18,490
Look at her blisters once.
Consider her old age...

228
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,510
and look at your youth once.

229
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:23,140
If you stomp on the ground,
water can come out of it.

230
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:25,340
But you're hell bent on
making her die of thirst.

231
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:29,780
Mother, stop this noise.
I can't bear to hear it.

232
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:32,140
Please stop it.

233
00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:40,110
The world will go on like this.
Nobody can stop it.

234
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:44,800
One cannot stop the world.
But I will make you stop this.

235
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:47,240
You'll have to accompany
me to Bombay.

236
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:52,520
Please don't refuse.
Or I will be disheartened.

237
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:02,330
Please give your assent.

238
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:07,980
Since you're asking me so lovingly,
how can I refuse you?

239
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,960
May God keep you happy always.

240
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:12,600
The decision has been made.

241
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:18,170
Forgive me if I said
anything harsh to you.

242
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,530
Not at all. You were showering flowers.

243
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:26,760
I feel as if I am collecting all
the happiness from Jehanabad.

244
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,430
One just needs
two things in life.

245
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:33,560
One, a friend.
And two, a wife.

246
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:36,400
- Have you found one?
- It's been ages.

247
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:38,450
I was only waiting for
you to make the choice.

248
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:03,200
A hundred rupees?
It's very expensive.

249
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:06,340
For you, it's very inexpensive.

250
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:10,810
For this price,
I should get married instead.

251
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:16,270
That's a good idea. Go ahead.
But don't forget me.

252
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:19,580
If a child is born,
take home a free sitar.

253
00:28:23,650 --> 00:28:24,850
Excuse me.

254
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:27,630
- Is my sitar ready?
- Yes, of course.

255
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:38,650
Have you played and checked it?
I suppose it's proper.

256
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:42,120
Why don't you play it
and check for yourself?

257
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:43,500
All right.

258
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,500
Why'd you snatch away the sitar?

259
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:10,890
If you're fond of playing the sitar,
then learn how to play it.

260
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:45,730
It doesn't seem to be in tune.

261
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,980
How would you know if it's in tune?
You don't even know how to play it.

262
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:51,290
I think your teacher is very ignorant.

263
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,840
Absolutely ignorant.

264
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:58,270
I'll fire him today.
You may teach me.

265
00:29:58,590 --> 00:30:01,480
I'm a Rajput.

266
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:05,710
That's surprising.

267
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:08,340
You're more fond of a sitar
than a sword?

268
00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:12,750
Yes, it's a matter of time.

269
00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:16,880
Then take advantage of time,
and take the job.

270
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:20,650
- What do you say?
- Why waste my time and yours?

271
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:23,150
- Take away the sitar.
- All right.

272
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:25,780
- How much do I owe?
- 16 rupees and 10 annas.

273
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:34,600
Here's the sitar.

274
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,260
Take your change,
3 rupees and 6 annas.

275
00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:49,810
- You may keep it.
- What for?

276
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:53,480
- As baksheesh.
- I won't take any baksheesh.

277
00:30:54,050 --> 00:30:57,840
Here's your money. You won't
take it? Then I'll throw it away.

278
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:02,130
How can you reject money
which has already come in?

279
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:03,760
You shouldn't interfere in everything.

280
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,650
Give it to me. I'll
return it to her myself.

281
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,080
Here it is!

282
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:24,890
- Why did you come here?
- To survey the shop.

283
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:26,930
Who are you to survey the shop?

284
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:29,960
Not now. But we'll see
what happens in future.

285
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:33,440
- He's not fit to run a shop.
- Really?

286
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:36,250
- Shall I take possession?
- Get lost, will you?

287
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:48,300
- How's work going?
- The shop is doing very well.

288
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:51,710
That's nice. So you've
grown fond of it?

289
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:56,120
- I've grown fond since childhood.
- I meant the shop.

290
00:31:56,290 --> 00:32:01,090
- But who've you grown fond of?
- I don't know myself.

291
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:03,670
How wonderful! Everything
about you is puzzling.

292
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:08,380
- The entire world is puzzling.
- I don't understand.

293
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,930
- How am I to blame?
- I am to blame.

294
00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:15,350
I came just to ask you
how the shop is doing.

295
00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:18,520
How you are feeling? And
whether you're happy or not?

296
00:32:19,050 --> 00:32:23,240
As far as the shop is concerned,
it's doing very well.

297
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:28,830
As for my happiness,
I'm not destined for it.

298
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:32,530
If it's possible for me
to make your happiness possible...

299
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:36,080
let me know. I'll try
to do something about it.

300
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,706
Money can't remedy every problem.

301
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:43,880
If not money, can my hands and
legs be of any service to you?

302
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:48,790
- No, that's not possible.
- Then God save you. I'm leaving.

303
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:52,980
Two or three races
must have already been run.

304
00:32:53,770 --> 00:32:55,770
Go and emerge victorious.

305
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:09,590
You work all day and read all night.
How can you remain healthy like this?

306
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:13,050
Will you get up or
shall I throw the book?

307
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,376
Here...

308
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:22,300
- How could you do this, mother?
- I've been asking you to eat food.

309
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,880
But you're not listening!

310
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:33,480
Mother, you're utterly ruthless.

311
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,740
You're right, son.

312
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:40,880
Every mother is ruthless.

313
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:52,140
You became upset, mother?
Anyway, pardon me, mother.

314
00:33:53,670 --> 00:33:55,070
You're such a fool!

315
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:38,830
- What are you doing? Give it to me.
- Take it.

316
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:42,800
- I'll beat you.
- I, too, have hands.

317
00:34:43,409 --> 00:34:45,226
I'll complain to father.
Shall I call out for him?

318
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:46,490
Go ahead!

319
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:48,830
- Father!
- Father!

320
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:51,410
- Come here, Munnu.
- Here I come.

321
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:11,940
'Renu'

322
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:26,250
You've written a wonderful
book, Ms. Renudevi.

323
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:30,180
It's really wonderful!

324
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:36,350
Do you have a copy of
'Tute Hue Taar'?

325
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,570
You're very fortunate.
10,000 copies were printed.

326
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:43,730
I have just one copy left.
All copies sold out fast.

327
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:46,420
- All of them have been sold?
- Can they remain unsold?

328
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,816
- She's an amazing writer.
- How nice!

329
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:51,830
- That's why I came rushing.
- It's quite natural.

330
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:53,980
- Here's the money.
- Thank you.

331
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:58,240
- Give me a copy of 'Tute Hue Taar'.
- All the copies have been sold.

332
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:02,530
You might return in a couple of months
after it's reprinted.

333
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:11,890
'Renu's second offering,
in fond memory of Jehanabad.'

334
00:36:16,930 --> 00:36:20,590
My greetings to the writer
of 'Toote Hue Taar'.

335
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:22,296
Bless you.

336
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:27,570
You've written so well!

337
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:30,390
The heart begins to beat faster.

338
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:33,230
One becomes so breathless...

339
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:37,970
and it works like lightning
for the broken hearts.

340
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:42,630
I hope you are well. When
did you suffer a heartbreak?

341
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:45,940
One of these days.

342
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:50,460
You had better watch out.
A heartbreak is very painful.

343
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:54,660
- Even smiles turn into tears.
- Really?

344
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:59,680
You speak like an experienced person.
Have you suffered a heartbreak?

345
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,860
Not something ordinary,
but a very acute heartbreak.

346
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:06,090
That's why your songs
have so much pain.

347
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,040
Here, take 5 rupees.

348
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:12,300
Donate it to some poor person,
lest you suffer some misfortune.

349
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:17,430
Yes, father?

350
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:20,640
- Greetings, Uncle.
- Bless you.

351
00:37:21,290 --> 00:37:24,850
I read your book.
It's very well written.

352
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:29,480
- Thanks.
- Uncle, you are merely praising.

353
00:37:30,330 --> 00:37:33,250
- You should give her something.
- Yes, that's why I've come.

354
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:35,880
You like watches
very much, don't you?

355
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:39,200
Remember, you received a watch from me
during your childhood...

356
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:40,960
which you lost somewhere.

357
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:45,210
Now I've brought a very good
watch for you. Take good care of it.

358
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:47,750
- Here...
- Thank you.

359
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:50,240
- I hope your mother is well.
- Yes.

360
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:29,430
Come to me, my beloved

361
00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:34,980
I am incomplete without you

362
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:43,800
Come and make my life complete

363
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:15,210
My tears dry up before falling

364
00:39:32,890 --> 00:39:39,420
My desires remain unfulfilled

365
00:39:39,770 --> 00:39:46,310
Come and make my life complete

366
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:59,860
I know the consequences
of falling in love

367
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:24,220
I hope you'll come back someday

368
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:31,120
Come and make my life complete

369
00:40:38,330 --> 00:40:44,800
You are the only one I loved

370
00:41:02,850 --> 00:41:09,360
I've waited for you all these years

371
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:15,990
My life is incomplete without you

372
00:41:41,470 --> 00:41:45,690
I am forced to say today that
Chander is ruining the shop.

373
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:48,720
Really? How did you come to know?

374
00:41:49,370 --> 00:41:55,100
I saw it myself. I swear,
just a few days ago...

375
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:58,320
a girl gave three rupees
10 annas as baksheesh.

376
00:41:59,170 --> 00:42:01,870
Chander was about to throw
the money away. I stopped him.

377
00:42:03,330 --> 00:42:06,720
So we're losing money, and our
Prakash is being fooled.

378
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:09,670
Then what?
Chander is filling his own pockets.

379
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:15,170
You should visit the shop
sometimes and keep me informed.

380
00:42:15,430 --> 00:42:20,670
It would be better if you
give me the shop...

381
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,770
and send Chander away.

382
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:26,450
All right. I'll get you the shop.

383
00:42:27,290 --> 00:42:32,330
Rather, I would say that Chander is
handling the shop very well.

384
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:35,740
You may send me away
to Jehanabad.

385
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:39,390
Hey! What are you saying?
You're changing your statements?

386
00:42:39,610 --> 00:42:44,310
Just turn around and see for
yourself. I'll be right back.

387
00:42:45,350 --> 00:42:48,000
- You must have believed him.
- Whether I believe him or not...

388
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:51,180
but to which account should
I write the 1,000 rupees?

389
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:53,286
- To the shop's account.
- I haven't been able to...

390
00:42:53,310 --> 00:42:56,740
- understand the shop account.
- Why do you need to understand?

391
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:00,510
Why not? How can one leave the
shop in an outsider's charge?

392
00:43:00,610 --> 00:43:03,410
Is Chander an outsider?
I've know him since childhood.

393
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:07,160
- He's my best friend.
- Friends can ruin others.

394
00:43:07,570 --> 00:43:11,350
Chander is among those friends
who will ruin himself...

395
00:43:11,390 --> 00:43:12,990
rather than see me be ruined.

396
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:15,940
You need not interfere in
matters between me and Chander.

397
00:43:16,330 --> 00:43:19,010
You cannot order me.
I am your mother.

398
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,140
Then should I leave home
and go away?

399
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:24,010
Did I say that?
Here's the 1,000 rupees.

400
00:43:55,890 --> 00:43:57,290
Come on. Come home.

401
00:44:16,650 --> 00:44:18,980
Now that I'm coming home, what
are you staring at? Come on.

402
00:44:49,970 --> 00:44:53,420
- Do you intend to die or what?
- I haven't reached that stage yet.

403
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:56,460
So you spend Sundays chasing cars?

404
00:44:56,670 --> 00:44:59,370
Not at all. I thought
it was someone I knew.

405
00:44:59,690 --> 00:45:01,940
Who's this person who's
known to you?

406
00:45:02,210 --> 00:45:06,240
- There's a gentleman.
- Is it a gentleman or a lady?

407
00:45:06,470 --> 00:45:08,060
You suspect unnecessarily.

408
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:10,710
Anyway, don't tell me
if you don't want.

409
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:14,220
- What book are you reading?
- It's titled 'Toote Hue Taar'.

410
00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:39,580
After a very long time...

411
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:42,480
my heart beat faster today again.

412
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:45,890
Just like it used to beat
during my childhood.

413
00:45:47,430 --> 00:45:49,950
He's likely to be
the same person.

414
00:45:51,250 --> 00:45:56,470
Otherwise I wouldn't have gazed
towards someone so anxiously.

415
00:45:58,310 --> 00:46:03,330
Call out to me

416
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:07,940
I'm waiting for you

417
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:16,460
My heart is full of hope

418
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:21,760
I'm waiting for you

419
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:36,230
Come to me.
The night is passing

420
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:44,920
Come, it's a beautiful
moonlit night

421
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:11,370
Even the stars in the sky...

422
00:47:11,470 --> 00:47:15,500
are about to retire

423
00:47:25,410 --> 00:47:29,920
Where are you, my love?

424
00:47:30,140 --> 00:47:33,730
I'm waiting for you

425
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:38,870
Call out to me

426
00:47:55,580 --> 00:47:59,350
My life seems so dreary

427
00:47:59,450 --> 00:48:04,030
Oh, why?

428
00:48:16,250 --> 00:48:20,630
The stars are witness...

429
00:48:20,950 --> 00:48:24,330
to my restlessness

430
00:48:36,570 --> 00:48:41,120
I yearn for you

431
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:45,230
Where are you?

432
00:48:55,150 --> 00:48:59,320
The sky looms above me
like a monster

433
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:03,430
as I wait for you

434
00:49:30,830 --> 00:49:33,180
He says I don't know
how to play the sitar.

435
00:49:35,780 --> 00:49:39,000
He must be right.
I might not know how.

436
00:49:42,650 --> 00:49:47,500
But he doesn't even understand
that melody and rhythm...

437
00:49:47,870 --> 00:49:49,370
are related to the heart.

438
00:49:52,270 --> 00:49:55,310
If the rhythms of love are formed
in the strings of the heart...

439
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:59,690
I would know how to
play a sitar automatically.

440
00:50:08,950 --> 00:50:11,670
Wake up, dear.
It's eight o'clock.

441
00:50:13,110 --> 00:50:15,230
What should I do about it?

442
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:18,290
The master is waiting for you
to teach you dancing.

443
00:50:18,790 --> 00:50:22,940
Tell him my limbs are sore.
No dancing today.

444
00:50:23,130 --> 00:50:26,510
Your hands and feet hurt because
you learn for one day...

445
00:50:26,570 --> 00:50:28,160
and stay absent for six days.

446
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:29,930
Who asked you to learn dancing?

447
00:50:30,340 --> 00:50:32,510
Once the master was appointed,
you lost interest.

448
00:50:32,730 --> 00:50:34,230
Come on, get up now.

449
00:50:50,310 --> 00:50:52,470
Aha! 'Aawaz' (Voice).

450
00:50:55,180 --> 00:51:01,410
If it features Renu's poems, it has
a voice. Otherwise it is voiceless.

451
00:51:01,690 --> 00:51:03,090
There is Renu's poem.

452
00:51:04,390 --> 00:51:06,090
The annual subscription
has been worth it.

453
00:51:06,350 --> 00:51:07,890
She writes so well.

454
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:14,510
My eyes are sleepless,
the stars shine and blink

455
00:51:25,510 --> 00:51:29,880
- The sitar has broken again.
- Yes, it has.

456
00:51:31,090 --> 00:51:33,910
It's suffering from being handled
by unskilled hands.

457
00:51:34,940 --> 00:51:37,700
I, too, feel pity
for this injured sitar.

458
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:41,940
It is voiceless. It cannot
even make any pleas.

459
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:46,120
There are just the ears which
can hear its silent pleas.

460
00:51:46,630 --> 00:51:50,520
Undoubtedly. Sometimes even I am
shocked during my dreams.

461
00:51:51,150 --> 00:51:53,360
It's possible it might be the
impact of its pleas.

462
00:51:53,490 --> 00:51:57,910
It's possible. By the way,
what brings you here today?

463
00:51:58,490 --> 00:52:01,920
I've already told you.
The sitar has broken again.

464
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:03,680
Leave it behind.
I'll fix it.

465
00:52:04,550 --> 00:52:06,250
- When should I return?
- In a week.

466
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:14,550
One week? Seven days!
That's too long.

467
00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:19,610
How will I spend the days?
I mean, without the sitar.

468
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:22,120
- It's my hobby, after all.
- I'm helpless.

469
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:23,760
It'll take that much time.

470
00:52:24,410 --> 00:52:29,660
In that case, lend me another
sitar during the period.

471
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:31,750
I'll amuse myself with it.

472
00:52:32,060 --> 00:52:34,990
I don't want yet another
sitar to be murdered.

473
00:52:35,710 --> 00:52:39,330
You are very ruthless.
Anyway, I'll return tomorrow.

474
00:52:39,970 --> 00:52:42,290
In fact, I'll come
and inquire every day.

475
00:52:42,790 --> 00:52:46,550
- I'll take it when it's mended.
- Why trouble your feet?

476
00:52:46,990 --> 00:52:50,520
Not the feet.
I have a motor car.

477
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:52,460
You'll be wasting your time.

478
00:52:52,770 --> 00:52:54,470
The sitar can't be
repaired so quickly.

479
00:52:54,550 --> 00:53:00,660
What else do I have to do?

480
00:53:00,810 --> 00:53:03,180
Very well then. As you please.

481
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:06,700
- Goodbye then.
- Goodbye.

482
00:53:11,670 --> 00:53:12,870
What luck!

483
00:53:14,110 --> 00:53:16,300
I couldn't solve my own puzzle.

484
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:19,330
And this lady has come
with yet another puzzle.

485
00:53:29,210 --> 00:53:36,390
My eyes are sleepless,
the stars shine and blink

486
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:41,060
Why not write to Renu?

487
00:53:42,470 --> 00:53:48,860
If I could meet her, perhaps I would
get to know of Lata through her.

488
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:55,120
But where will I get
Renu's address?

489
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:58,920
Why not write to this editor?

490
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:01,020
That's it!

491
00:54:10,810 --> 00:54:17,100
Ms. Renudevi...

492
00:54:21,110 --> 00:54:23,370
I've been an editor for ten years.

493
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,120
But before now, I have never
received so many letters.

494
00:54:26,820 --> 00:54:31,070
This Renu is just a beginner,
and so many letters?

495
00:54:34,950 --> 00:54:37,640
Here, get these delivered
to Ms. Renu's home.

496
00:54:57,510 --> 00:55:00,660
I see everything swaying today.

497
00:55:01,630 --> 00:55:07,500
I feel as if everything
is swaying and singing.

498
00:55:08,690 --> 00:55:15,820
I wonder if I'm singing alone,
or the world is singing with me.

499
00:55:16,290 --> 00:55:20,140
You appear very happy today. Have
you seen some saffron fields or what?

500
00:55:20,660 --> 00:55:23,110
There are no saffron fields here.

501
00:55:24,010 --> 00:55:26,470
Here, only mustard can blossom.

502
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:29,130
You don't need mustard.

503
00:55:30,100 --> 00:55:32,130
You are so youthful.

504
00:55:33,180 --> 00:55:36,860
And to add to it, there's
the sweet syrup of love.

505
00:55:56,680 --> 00:55:57,980
I have...

506
00:56:01,370 --> 00:56:06,090
lost my heart to someone.
I'm in love

507
00:56:17,420 --> 00:56:20,600
I expressed my feelings...

508
00:56:22,050 --> 00:56:25,310
through my eyes

509
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:58,770
He looked at me with love

510
00:56:59,670 --> 00:57:01,330
I blushed

511
00:57:16,420 --> 00:57:20,090
My stole slipped off

512
00:57:20,610 --> 00:57:25,300
I felt coy

513
00:57:26,230 --> 00:57:30,270
My heart I lost...

514
00:57:30,490 --> 00:57:33,710
when I met his gaze

515
00:57:49,590 --> 00:57:53,110
The love in my heart...

516
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:57,060
fills my entire being

517
00:57:58,410 --> 00:58:01,950
My youthful beauty...

518
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:09,420
has an admirer

519
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:14,340
My life has found new meaning

520
00:58:14,630 --> 00:58:17,940
I'm in love

521
00:58:18,780 --> 00:58:20,160
I have...

522
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:28,300
lost my heart to someone.
I'm in love

523
00:58:32,350 --> 00:58:34,610
You're reading the letters
from your admirers?

524
00:58:35,770 --> 00:58:37,730
Give me this letter.
Let me read it.

525
00:58:39,100 --> 00:58:46,070
Wow! He writes, The most beautiful
Renudevi, my greetings to you.

526
00:58:47,430 --> 00:58:49,860
Ever since the day I
read your poetry...

527
00:58:51,190 --> 00:58:53,720
believe me, I have gone mad.

528
00:58:55,540 --> 00:58:59,310
I read your books
throughout the day...

529
00:59:00,930 --> 00:59:04,880
and sleep at night
with your books on my heart.

530
00:59:07,610 --> 00:59:12,370
May you live and die with
the books on your heart.

531
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:15,560
Listen to what this
gentleman writes.

532
00:59:16,260 --> 00:59:18,580
But he appears to
be a serious person.

533
00:59:20,020 --> 00:59:22,620
My dreams are visible
in your poems.

534
00:59:23,410 --> 00:59:29,440
My suppressed cries and stifled
sighs appear together at places.

535
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:34,100
I feel as if someone
is talking to me.

536
00:59:34,570 --> 00:59:35,970
How well written!

537
00:59:37,110 --> 00:59:39,270
He appears to be
a lovesick person.

538
00:59:39,910 --> 00:59:41,210
Finally he writes...

539
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:46,180
Madam, do reply to my letter.

540
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:49,260
I just want to talk
to you for a while.

541
00:59:49,750 --> 00:59:52,760
- Do call him, Lata.
- What nonsense!

542
00:59:53,220 --> 00:59:55,820
- We'll get a bad name.
- What's bad about it?

543
00:59:56,980 --> 00:59:58,300
It'll be interesting.

544
00:59:58,610 --> 01:00:02,480
- What if he yearns for us?
- He'll get a resounding slap.

545
01:00:04,030 --> 01:00:05,530
I'm not ready for this.

546
01:00:05,860 --> 01:00:09,680
You stay seated in the car.
I'll pose as Renu and meet him.

547
01:00:10,010 --> 01:00:13,430
- But where will we meet him?
- There are several places.

548
01:00:13,910 --> 01:00:16,330
Give me some paper.
I'll write the letter.

549
01:00:45,910 --> 01:00:47,210
Lata's memento...

550
01:00:49,530 --> 01:00:53,390
Perhaps I might find the missing
link of our lost world.

551
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:57,170
You'll surely find it.
What missing link?

552
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:01,560
You've come at the right time.

553
01:01:02,020 --> 01:01:04,790
- May God give you my own life too.
- Why's that?

554
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:07,410
Because I have to go
on some urgent business.

555
01:01:07,790 --> 01:01:09,490
Please look after the shop for a while.

556
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:11,740
I'm sorry, but I'm not free.

557
01:01:12,070 --> 01:01:16,150
I'm asking you this decently, because
I consider you to be a decent person.

558
01:01:16,340 --> 01:01:17,930
I'm not a decent person. All right?

559
01:01:23,470 --> 01:01:26,180
Let me tell you,
you'll be losing money.

560
01:01:26,440 --> 01:01:28,386
- How's that?
- The same girl...

561
01:01:28,410 --> 01:01:30,260
is going to come
to the shop today...

562
01:01:30,740 --> 01:01:32,716
who gave that three rupees
and ten annas baksheesh.

563
01:01:32,740 --> 01:01:33,940
- Really?
- Yes.

564
01:01:35,860 --> 01:01:37,060
She's arrived.

565
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:40,310
Collect sixteen rupees eight annas
and give her the sitar. I'll be back.

566
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:51,020
Is my sitar ready?

567
01:01:53,970 --> 01:01:55,270
Yes, of course.

568
01:01:57,740 --> 01:01:59,910
- Who are you?
- I'm a man.

569
01:02:00,630 --> 01:02:03,490
Where's that person who's always here?

570
01:02:04,050 --> 01:02:09,500
He has moved ahead.

571
01:02:09,880 --> 01:02:12,850
You are very impolite.
I'll collect the sitar from him.

572
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:16,960
You don't want the sitar?
You want that person?

573
01:02:17,300 --> 01:02:18,400
Yes.

574
01:02:19,210 --> 01:02:21,730
- I know everything.
- What do you know?

575
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:23,530
- Nothing.
- Get me my sitar.

576
01:02:32,540 --> 01:02:33,840
Here it is.

577
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:36,520
This? What's this?

578
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:39,601
This is a musical instrument
meant to be played by ghosts.

579
01:02:44,530 --> 01:02:45,830
Here's 17 rupees.

580
01:02:46,930 --> 01:02:49,160
My sitar is over there.
I'll go get it.

581
01:03:01,830 --> 01:03:04,930
- What's your name?
- Mohan.

582
01:03:07,510 --> 01:03:13,340
You can eat opium for the balance.

583
01:03:14,020 --> 01:03:15,320
What a donkey!

584
01:03:21,990 --> 01:03:23,640
Excuse me. Are you Renu?

585
01:03:25,240 --> 01:03:28,680
Don't be scared. I am Chander.
You have called me.

586
01:03:29,930 --> 01:03:32,040
Please see who this person is.

587
01:03:36,580 --> 01:03:38,230
Just see what he wants.

588
01:03:39,180 --> 01:03:41,890
- What's the matter? Who are you?
- Excuse me. I am mistaken.

589
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:45,880
What nonsense! Get lost!

590
01:03:46,690 --> 01:03:47,890
Let's go.

591
01:04:16,850 --> 01:04:19,220
- It appears to be this person.
- How would you know?

592
01:04:21,060 --> 01:04:22,360
We'll know soon.

593
01:04:25,720 --> 01:04:27,020
What's your name?

594
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:30,800
What's your name?

595
01:04:32,450 --> 01:04:34,050
- Did you write the letter?
- No.

596
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:36,626
If you give me the address,
I'll write from home.

597
01:04:36,650 --> 01:04:38,050
Get away from here.

598
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:40,716
Let's go home.
You'll earn us a bad name.

599
01:04:40,740 --> 01:04:43,330
- Get lost.
- How can a thirsty man go away...

600
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:45,656
after reaching the banks of
the rivers Ganges and Jamuna?

601
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:46,780
Scoundrel!

602
01:05:00,840 --> 01:05:02,690
- Why is this person here?
- Who?

603
01:05:03,510 --> 01:05:05,510
- I'll tell you later.
- Where are you going?

604
01:05:05,980 --> 01:05:10,770
- I'll be back.
- I won't let you go.

605
01:05:10,990 --> 01:05:12,390
No, no, let go.

606
01:05:31,910 --> 01:05:33,560
Here, the sitar has
broken once again.

607
01:05:34,180 --> 01:05:37,570
- You've come here too?
- What else could I do?

608
01:05:37,870 --> 01:05:41,490
I didn't find you there. There was
a strange person at the shop.

609
01:05:41,810 --> 01:05:43,410
What if somebody sees us here?

610
01:05:44,100 --> 01:05:47,790
I'll say I had gone
to your shop for the sitar.

611
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:50,940
And when I learned
you came here for sightseeing...

612
01:05:51,270 --> 01:05:54,160
- I came here.
- Please go away from here.

613
01:06:11,050 --> 01:06:13,560
Why are you looking around
with such a frightened look?

614
01:06:15,820 --> 01:06:18,500
So, you're waiting for someone.

615
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:22,590
I know now! I'm the same person.

616
01:06:22,970 --> 01:06:24,790
- Who are you?
- The same person...

617
01:06:24,870 --> 01:06:27,730
- for whom you're waiting.
- I'm not waiting for anybody.

618
01:06:28,280 --> 01:06:30,110
I come here for a stroll sometimes.

619
01:06:31,050 --> 01:06:32,950
Then let's stroll together today.

620
01:06:34,690 --> 01:06:37,070
Just see how enchanting
the weather is.

621
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:53,680
- Who was he?
- You'll know in a few days.

622
01:06:54,190 --> 01:06:57,490
Did you bring me with you for this?
I won't come with you ever again.

623
01:06:58,050 --> 01:06:59,350
Don't get upset.

624
01:06:59,620 --> 01:07:02,050
How could I know he'd be here?

625
01:07:02,900 --> 01:07:06,760
But he's a strange man.
He gets angry at the drop of a hat.

626
01:07:07,100 --> 01:07:10,680
He must be pretending to be angry
just to impress you.

627
01:07:10,950 --> 01:07:15,190
So be it. But he didn't even
speak to me properly today.

628
01:07:15,530 --> 01:07:18,190
That's because you're
always chasing him around.

629
01:07:18,450 --> 01:07:21,750
Disappear for a week.
He'll search all over for you.

630
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:24,180
But with which heart?

631
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:26,640
Nowadays, when in love...

632
01:07:26,940 --> 01:07:29,120
one should use the brain
as well as the heart.

633
01:07:31,650 --> 01:07:34,690
Look at this. He forgot his watch.

634
01:07:35,420 --> 01:07:38,330
I got a memento to
amuse myself with.

635
01:07:44,330 --> 01:07:46,520
Something lost shouldn't
be considered a memento.

636
01:07:47,540 --> 01:07:48,980
Return his watch.

637
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:52,170
It's possible it's someone else's memento.

638
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:54,700
Come on. Let's go now.

639
01:08:08,020 --> 01:08:12,310
My childhood sweetheart,
don't forget me

640
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:18,070
The world will mock me

641
01:08:42,189 --> 01:08:46,749
I won't be able to bear separation

642
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:53,209
I won't be able to express my sorrow

643
01:08:55,590 --> 01:08:59,010
The world is so cruel

644
01:09:03,810 --> 01:09:05,210
Where do I go?

645
01:09:06,850 --> 01:09:11,120
I live in the hope of meeting you

646
01:09:11,490 --> 01:09:16,560
The world will mock me

647
01:09:28,649 --> 01:09:33,249
I spend the night counting stars

648
01:09:35,840 --> 01:09:40,040
I wish you were by my side

649
01:09:42,189 --> 01:09:45,519
You are so far away...

650
01:09:50,240 --> 01:09:51,540
I'm so restless

651
01:09:53,160 --> 01:09:57,230
This world has no idea
how I pine

652
01:09:57,840 --> 01:10:02,850
Come, before the world scorns me

653
01:10:14,760 --> 01:10:19,290
No one can understand

654
01:10:21,770 --> 01:10:25,680
My loved ones seem so distant

655
01:10:27,950 --> 01:10:31,280
My heart weeps.
It calls out to you

656
01:10:35,630 --> 01:10:37,330
It calls out to you

657
01:10:38,950 --> 01:10:42,970
Listen to my plea

658
01:10:43,530 --> 01:10:48,460
The world will mock me

659
01:10:50,490 --> 01:10:54,450
My childhood sweetheart,
don't forget me

660
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:59,980
The world will mock at me

661
01:11:04,890 --> 01:11:08,130
Ramu, oh Ramu...

662
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:13,420
- get me some drinking water.
- I'll get it.

663
01:11:29,660 --> 01:11:31,230
- Has Chander returned?
- No.

664
01:11:33,390 --> 01:11:35,760
- What's the time?
- It's 11 o'clock.

665
01:11:36,590 --> 01:11:37,790
11 o'clock?

666
01:11:39,860 --> 01:11:44,230
Chander hasn't returned yet.
Where has he gone?

667
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:48,570
Where does he go away?

668
01:11:51,960 --> 01:11:53,500
I'll ask him today.

669
01:11:53,980 --> 01:11:56,020
Take this. I won't drink.

670
01:11:57,390 --> 01:12:00,210
He must be coming any time now.
Go and warm his food.

671
01:12:02,940 --> 01:12:04,690
He must be feeling scared alone.

672
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:08,720
I've even told him to get married.

673
01:12:10,050 --> 01:12:12,310
For how long can I live,
looking forward to it?

674
01:12:23,860 --> 01:12:26,590
Chander, dear, where were you?

675
01:12:28,230 --> 01:12:31,430
You know I've had a fever since morning.

676
01:12:32,360 --> 01:12:33,980
I've been waiting for you.

677
01:12:35,380 --> 01:12:38,960
Didn't I tell you to
return early today?

678
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:41,010
But you never listen.

679
01:12:41,450 --> 01:12:42,550
Greetings.

680
01:12:45,750 --> 01:12:49,780
It's you, Prakash?
Bless you.

681
01:12:51,110 --> 01:12:53,220
I'm don't understand everything
very well these days.

682
01:12:55,170 --> 01:12:56,770
You're suffering from a high fever!

683
01:12:57,160 --> 01:13:00,200
Yes, the worst fever
is my old age.

684
01:13:00,460 --> 01:13:03,420
Come inside, lest you catch cold.

685
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:14,530
I was waiting for Chander. He hasn't
yet returned from the shop.

686
01:13:15,450 --> 01:13:17,150
He must have got some urgent work.

687
01:13:30,540 --> 01:13:33,380
The first responsibility of a son
is to serve his mother.

688
01:13:34,340 --> 01:13:36,470
There can be nothing
more important.

689
01:13:37,510 --> 01:13:41,690
- I will surely question him today.
- No, no, dear. Please don't.

690
01:13:41,750 --> 01:13:43,050
You take rest.

691
01:13:45,640 --> 01:13:48,600
Look after her. I'll go
and fetch the doctor.

692
01:14:05,690 --> 01:14:08,000
Where were you, Chander?

693
01:14:08,970 --> 01:14:10,366
I had some business.

694
01:14:10,390 --> 01:14:13,220
- Where?
- I had some work.

695
01:14:14,890 --> 01:14:19,650
Don't I have the right to ask you
what was so important?

696
01:14:20,020 --> 01:14:24,870
You surely have the right. After all,
you opened the shop for me.

697
01:14:25,820 --> 01:14:28,620
Tell me, your servant
is at your service.

698
01:14:28,690 --> 01:14:32,500
Stop your nonsense.
I'm not referring to the shop.

699
01:14:32,940 --> 01:14:35,820
Then what else?
Don't try to hide from me.

700
01:14:36,540 --> 01:14:38,296
I can't handle the shop.
Arrange something else.

701
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:40,050
Chander, come to your senses.

702
01:14:40,690 --> 01:14:42,860
I'm asking you because
of your mother's ailment.

703
01:14:43,480 --> 01:14:45,030
Don't misunderstand me.

704
01:14:45,190 --> 01:14:47,680
Why do you relate everything to mother?

705
01:14:48,180 --> 01:14:51,120
Speak frankly. You say one thing,
while meaning another.

706
01:14:51,170 --> 01:14:52,840
- You're telling me this?
- Yes.

707
01:15:02,170 --> 01:15:06,150
Today, a poor man raised his
hand on the wealthy.

708
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:15,010
No, a friend has slapped
another friend.

709
01:15:17,950 --> 01:15:20,060
Go and see for yourself
your mother's condition.

710
01:15:20,590 --> 01:15:22,090
She has a very high fever.

711
01:15:23,080 --> 01:15:24,880
I'll go and fetch
the doctor right away.

712
01:15:56,230 --> 01:15:58,590
My heart rejoices

713
01:15:59,210 --> 01:16:01,950
My life is blissful

714
01:16:23,350 --> 01:16:27,290
With a smile on my face...

715
01:16:27,850 --> 01:16:33,170
with a blush on my cheeks...

716
01:16:47,080 --> 01:16:52,680
my heart sings

717
01:16:58,630 --> 01:17:00,980
As I miss him...

718
01:17:01,540 --> 01:17:04,430
my heart rejoices

719
01:17:04,460 --> 01:17:07,350
My life is blissful

720
01:17:25,150 --> 01:17:33,150
My feelings are beyond my control

721
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:48,550
My life has found new meaning

722
01:17:54,540 --> 01:17:56,940
Love is in the air

723
01:17:57,480 --> 01:18:00,260
My life is blissful

724
01:18:00,390 --> 01:18:03,230
My heart rejoices

725
01:18:18,120 --> 01:18:21,050
I can't reduce the price below 400 rupees.

726
01:18:21,610 --> 01:18:23,280
400 rupees is too much.

727
01:18:23,620 --> 01:18:24,920
As you please.

728
01:18:25,320 --> 01:18:28,040
- What's your opinion?
- Buy it.

729
01:18:28,490 --> 01:18:31,570
For a hobby, even 10,000
rupees is a low price.

730
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:33,260
I've only quoted 400 rupees.

731
01:18:42,450 --> 01:18:45,200
- What's happened to him?
- Perhaps bitten by some scorpion.

732
01:18:45,440 --> 01:18:48,390
- Must be crazy.
- And made us crazy, too.

733
01:18:49,070 --> 01:18:50,370
Let's go home.

734
01:19:23,370 --> 01:19:27,590
- What are you looking for, son?
- Nothing. I've lost something.

735
01:19:28,220 --> 01:19:30,990
- I've lost something, mother.
- What's the matter, dear?

736
01:19:31,780 --> 01:19:34,950
I've noticed for many days, now,
you seem to be so lost.

737
01:19:35,540 --> 01:19:37,770
Tell me what the matter is.

738
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:41,476
Nothing, mother. What should
I tell you? I've lost something.

739
01:19:41,500 --> 01:19:44,790
You won't tell your mother?
Tell me.

740
01:19:46,270 --> 01:19:50,480
Mother, I've lost something.
What should I tell you?

741
01:20:00,040 --> 01:20:08,040
Oh God, I cannot ask You to
reduce my love for him.

742
01:20:10,220 --> 01:20:18,220
But give me strength so
I can ask after his well being.

743
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,450
You were so worried
over this ordinary watch?

744
01:20:56,050 --> 01:20:57,450
It's no ordinary watch.

745
01:20:57,640 --> 01:20:59,640
This watch is more precious
to me than my own life.

746
01:20:59,880 --> 01:21:02,340
In that case, your life
is in my fingers.

747
01:21:02,770 --> 01:21:04,550
How will that help?

748
01:21:06,040 --> 01:21:07,440
You are very merciful.

749
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:10,720
How did you find this watch?

750
01:21:10,810 --> 01:21:13,360
You were so afraid
you dropped it in the park.

751
01:21:13,930 --> 01:21:15,830
I happened to see it.

752
01:21:16,070 --> 01:21:18,000
You've been very obliging today.

753
01:21:18,290 --> 01:21:21,240
Mere words won't do.
Get me some baksheesh.

754
01:21:21,870 --> 01:21:24,430
Remember, I gave you baksheesh that day?

755
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:27,740
You are very mischievous.
What's your name?

756
01:21:27,940 --> 01:21:31,170
- Basanti. And what's yours?
- Chandra.

757
01:21:35,150 --> 01:21:40,060
Every place brightens up
with its light.

758
01:21:41,450 --> 01:21:43,640
But I remained in the dark
till today.

759
01:21:43,850 --> 01:21:45,150
Yes, of course.

760
01:21:45,670 --> 01:21:49,700
Someone who is always
surrounded by spring...

761
01:21:51,040 --> 01:21:52,900
how would that person
have the time...

762
01:21:53,630 --> 01:21:56,960
to glance at Chandra's (moon)
spotted face?

763
01:21:58,720 --> 01:22:03,190
I'll always look at it.
I mean, at the moon.

764
01:22:05,110 --> 01:22:07,270
This watch seems to have
some deep mystery.

765
01:22:07,590 --> 01:22:10,550
- Very deep.
- Deeper than the ocean?

766
01:22:10,640 --> 01:22:12,390
Yes, much deeper.

767
01:22:13,400 --> 01:22:15,740
In that case, I wouldn't be able
to reach to its depths.

768
01:22:15,950 --> 01:22:17,550
I wouldn't even advise you that.

769
01:22:18,360 --> 01:22:21,670
It's very dangerous to try to reach
to the depths of the ocean.

770
01:22:22,730 --> 01:22:27,520
Very well. I won't try to reach
to those depths.

771
01:22:28,870 --> 01:22:36,760
But I do have the right to sit on
the seashore and count its waves.

772
01:22:40,920 --> 01:22:42,850
All right. Goodbye, then.

773
01:22:43,460 --> 01:22:44,560
Goodbye.

774
01:22:50,920 --> 01:22:53,340
You keep on counting the
waves of the ocean...

775
01:22:54,310 --> 01:22:58,940
and I, with the
help of this watch...

776
01:23:00,320 --> 01:23:02,160
will keep on counting
the beats of life.

777
01:23:09,920 --> 01:23:12,100
Why would you write now, Chandra?

778
01:23:13,400 --> 01:23:15,350
Your Lata will herself
write to you.

779
01:23:47,780 --> 01:23:50,850
- I have much to say to you.
- About what?

780
01:23:52,030 --> 01:23:53,430
His name is Chandra.

781
01:23:54,590 --> 01:23:57,000
And he truly appears to be
crazy about someone.

782
01:23:57,970 --> 01:24:00,670
Crazy people are
indeed very clever.

783
01:24:01,570 --> 01:24:07,850
And those crazy about love can make
the whole world go crazy.

784
01:24:08,690 --> 01:24:10,030
You're right, Lata.

785
01:24:11,300 --> 01:24:13,900
He was becoming mad over
losing the watch.

786
01:24:15,060 --> 01:24:19,670
If he hadn't got the watch, I wonder
what would've become of him?

787
01:24:20,740 --> 01:24:23,290
You can see for yourself.
I'm a poetess.

788
01:24:24,010 --> 01:24:26,550
I know other people's
pain and sufferings very well.

789
01:24:27,380 --> 01:24:29,260
I can guess the whereabouts
of the heartbeats...

790
01:24:29,500 --> 01:24:31,620
by checking the pulse of love.

791
01:24:37,290 --> 01:24:40,450
Gosh, the pulse is so fast.

792
01:24:41,220 --> 01:24:42,820
Are you coming straight from there?

793
01:24:43,880 --> 01:24:46,650
If you had been feeling
as I do...

794
01:24:48,750 --> 01:24:50,920
perhaps you wouldn't
have laughed like that.

795
01:24:51,480 --> 01:24:53,770
I've been playing with fire
for years.

796
01:24:54,670 --> 01:24:58,820
You've just begun.
You'll forget after a few days.

797
01:24:59,320 --> 01:25:04,760
It seems like I've been
lost in his love.

798
01:25:07,500 --> 01:25:09,690
One gains only after losing.

799
01:25:10,790 --> 01:25:15,890
I can't give an answer to this today.
I've got something else today.

800
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:18,910
I swear, I've got something.

801
01:25:20,260 --> 01:25:21,760
What have you got, Lata?

802
01:25:22,380 --> 01:25:24,500
- A lost heart.
- From where?

803
01:25:25,100 --> 01:25:26,790
- From you.
- From me?

804
01:25:28,550 --> 01:25:30,570
That's the title of my song.

805
01:25:31,430 --> 01:25:32,830
What's wrong with you?

806
01:25:33,260 --> 01:25:37,030
Nothing. That day you seemed
to see everything swaying.

807
01:25:37,430 --> 01:25:40,090
Today, I'm feeling as if
everything is swaying.

808
01:25:48,630 --> 01:25:53,260
My lost love I've found.
The world seems so beautiful

809
01:25:53,300 --> 01:25:57,710
There's joy all around

810
01:26:09,560 --> 01:26:13,650
To be happy always,
everyone should be in love

811
01:26:27,660 --> 01:26:31,780
Don't think what the word might say

812
01:26:34,590 --> 01:26:39,086
My lost love I've found.
The world seems so beautiful

813
01:26:39,110 --> 01:26:43,130
There's joy all around

814
01:26:50,340 --> 01:26:54,560
I still remember everything

815
01:27:08,130 --> 01:27:12,390
All the moments spent together

816
01:27:14,910 --> 01:27:19,486
My lost love I've found.
The world seems so beautiful

817
01:27:19,510 --> 01:27:23,340
There's joy all around

818
01:27:28,130 --> 01:27:31,710
The eyes speak the language of love

819
01:27:39,380 --> 01:27:43,560
The world remains oblivious

820
01:27:46,110 --> 01:27:50,500
My lost love I've found.
The world seems so beautiful

821
01:27:50,550 --> 01:27:54,400
There's joy all around

822
01:27:59,430 --> 01:28:03,670
You bring back childhood memories

823
01:28:18,970 --> 01:28:22,990
You give me a reason to live

824
01:28:25,610 --> 01:28:29,906
My lost love I've found.
The world seems so beautiful

825
01:28:29,930 --> 01:28:34,180
There's joy all around

826
01:28:42,230 --> 01:28:46,960
With this letter, you'll learn
the whereabouts of your Lata.

827
01:29:08,920 --> 01:29:11,760
I'll be going to Mr. Radhababu's
home today at 4 o'clock.

828
01:29:13,970 --> 01:29:16,740
You get there between
8 and 9 o'clock.

829
01:29:16,860 --> 01:29:18,960
- All right.
- And listen...

830
01:29:19,330 --> 01:29:21,320
- What will you wear?
- I'll wear a suit.

831
01:29:21,700 --> 01:29:26,510
The suit again? You'd better
wear a sherwani coat.

832
01:29:26,540 --> 01:29:29,270
You see, mother, don't ask me
to wear a sherwani coat.

833
01:29:29,860 --> 01:29:33,260
I appear a bit fat in a sherwani
coat. What if the matter...?

834
01:29:33,390 --> 01:29:38,770
You'll be attending a joyous
occasion. Don't wear a suit.

835
01:29:38,990 --> 01:29:40,890
It's very difficult to wear
a sherwani coat.

836
01:29:41,180 --> 01:29:44,430
Is it easy to bring home
a girl after marriage?

837
01:29:44,740 --> 01:29:48,820
Mother, if you ask me to wear a
sherwani coat, I'll leave home.

838
01:29:49,460 --> 01:29:51,916
And if you insist on wearing
a suit, then I'll leave home.

839
01:29:51,940 --> 01:29:54,400
Hold on, mother. I will
wear a sherwani coat.

840
01:29:54,460 --> 01:29:57,640
But you'd better make sure
you finalize the alliance.

841
01:29:58,120 --> 01:29:59,640
Finalize the alliance!

842
01:30:25,640 --> 01:30:31,930
A black sherwani, a churidar-pyjama,
where are you heading to?

843
01:30:34,260 --> 01:30:39,260
A black sherwani, a churidar-pyjama,
where are you heading to?

844
01:30:42,310 --> 01:30:45,140
- Both of us look very deadly today.
- Yes, we do.

845
01:30:45,780 --> 01:30:48,700
I've arrived at the right time.
Otherwise, you'd have been disappeared.

846
01:30:49,030 --> 01:30:50,730
You have to accompany
me today. Come on.

847
01:30:50,800 --> 01:30:53,070
- Where?
- There's a feast for you today.

848
01:30:54,170 --> 01:30:58,450
- A feast? Where?
- At my future wife's place.

849
01:30:59,180 --> 01:31:03,260
Congratulations. I would have
surely accompanied you.

850
01:31:04,260 --> 01:31:06,900
But I've just learned of someone's
whereabouts after several years.

851
01:31:07,060 --> 01:31:10,020
- About whom?
- My future wife, perhaps.

852
01:31:10,260 --> 01:31:13,070
That's not fair. You have
to accompany me today.

853
01:31:13,220 --> 01:31:15,140
You're not so selfish, Prakash.

854
01:31:15,510 --> 01:31:20,920
Selfish? I have made just one
request in this lifetime.

855
01:31:21,130 --> 01:31:25,590
But at what time, dear?
Please consider the circumstances.

856
01:31:26,740 --> 01:31:29,270
At such a time,
even if God calls me...

857
01:31:30,300 --> 01:31:32,640
I'll have to ask for
some time from Him too.

858
01:31:33,070 --> 01:31:34,570
All right. As you wish.

859
01:31:35,040 --> 01:31:38,370
But who's your future wife?

860
01:31:39,150 --> 01:31:42,230
Not now. I don't want to bring
a bad name to anybody.

861
01:31:43,160 --> 01:31:44,660
Then let's use the car.

862
01:31:45,440 --> 01:31:49,140
I feel like taking a walk right now.

863
01:31:49,290 --> 01:31:52,480
Why are you being so difficult?
Let me take you in the car.

864
01:31:53,220 --> 01:31:57,370
You want to know
where she lives, don't you?

865
01:31:59,970 --> 01:32:01,530
Carry on.
Emerge victorious.

866
01:32:03,280 --> 01:32:05,170
You, too, enjoy yourself.

867
01:32:43,950 --> 01:32:45,820
What's the program after
the meals, Basanti?

868
01:32:46,530 --> 01:32:47,990
How would I know, Uncle?

869
01:32:50,340 --> 01:32:53,530
I hear you're responsible for
all the arrangements for the day.

870
01:32:55,020 --> 01:32:57,060
Are you going to perform your
dance after the meals?

871
01:32:57,570 --> 01:33:02,200
There's no fixed program.
But I can't refuse you.

872
01:33:03,090 --> 01:33:04,590
I'll do as you wish.

873
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:07,740
- Bless you.
- Bless you.

874
01:35:28,140 --> 01:35:30,680
My feet hurt because
of dancing for you...

875
01:35:31,010 --> 01:35:34,380
- yet you came here?
- I'm feeling uneasy.

876
01:35:35,030 --> 01:35:36,950
Why are you feeling uneasy?

877
01:35:39,670 --> 01:35:41,350
I feel like reciting a couplet.

878
01:35:42,220 --> 01:35:44,540
You may call me whatever you like...

879
01:35:44,830 --> 01:35:46,860
but I won't let you recite
a couplet right now.

880
01:35:51,270 --> 01:35:52,670
Tell me something, dear.

881
01:35:53,970 --> 01:35:57,730
Who's this poet gentleman wearing
a tight pyjama and a sherwani coat?

882
01:35:58,330 --> 01:36:01,010
- How would I know?
- Yes, of course. How would you know?

883
01:36:02,060 --> 01:36:03,760
Is that why you felt shy and left?

884
01:36:05,420 --> 01:36:08,660
His features are a bit rough,
but he's a nice person.

885
01:36:09,280 --> 01:36:11,080
Have you asked if
he's a poet or not?

886
01:36:11,460 --> 01:36:13,220
Nonsensical talk isn't always befitting.

887
01:36:17,320 --> 01:36:18,520
Yes, aunty?

888
01:36:18,780 --> 01:36:22,340
They liked your dance so much,
they want to see it again.

889
01:36:22,770 --> 01:36:25,380
No, aunty. My legs are sore.

890
01:36:26,040 --> 01:36:28,660
Anyway, don't dance.
But why don't you come along?

891
01:36:29,490 --> 01:36:31,090
Why don't you come too, Lata?

892
01:36:31,550 --> 01:36:35,290
Let her be. You know, don't you,
that she's feeling shy? Come on.

893
01:36:35,760 --> 01:36:38,630
I knew earlier that she...

894
01:38:00,190 --> 01:38:02,610
I said I wouldn't let her
indulge in poetry today.

895
01:38:03,040 --> 01:38:05,320
- You still didn't listen.
- You have returned again?

896
01:38:07,600 --> 01:38:09,570
I was into such
beautiful poetry.

897
01:38:10,570 --> 01:38:12,510
I had begun such a beautiful poem.

898
01:38:14,240 --> 01:38:16,860
I wonder what I was about to say.

899
01:38:17,230 --> 01:38:21,960
At this late hour? Aren't you afraid
to be in this deserted place?

900
01:38:22,380 --> 01:38:25,810
I wasn't alone. My Chandra (moon), too,
was with me.

901
01:38:26,210 --> 01:38:28,270
Where's Chandra (moon)? Let me see, too.

902
01:38:33,540 --> 01:38:34,840
Look over there!

903
01:38:38,530 --> 01:38:41,080
It hid behind dark clouds
upon seeing you.

904
01:38:45,420 --> 01:38:47,080
I couldn't hold myself back.

905
01:38:48,250 --> 01:38:50,720
Otherwise Chandra wouldn't
have had to hide.

906
01:38:52,090 --> 01:38:55,120
Come with me.
I want to speak with you.

907
01:38:56,060 --> 01:38:59,570
You're never going to spare me.
You've become a real pain in the neck.

908
01:39:00,750 --> 01:39:01,950
You're right.

909
01:39:03,260 --> 01:39:05,890
Wait awhile. Let me
bid goodbye to Chandra.

910
01:39:06,710 --> 01:39:07,910
Go ahead.

911
01:39:09,060 --> 01:39:12,930
Goodbye, Chandra.
This menace is taking me away.

912
01:39:13,670 --> 01:39:15,480
You may greet Chandra daily.

913
01:39:16,420 --> 01:39:18,850
But this menace will
never return again.

914
01:39:22,150 --> 01:39:24,220
Why are you talking
like a mad person?

915
01:39:25,640 --> 01:39:27,430
I have been driven mad.

916
01:39:28,330 --> 01:39:30,210
- Who made you mad?
- You did.

917
01:39:30,690 --> 01:39:35,930
- I did?
- Did I cause you any harm...

918
01:39:36,670 --> 01:39:38,350
that I've had to
undergo such a punishment?

919
01:39:40,190 --> 01:39:43,350
What are you saying?
I don't understand.

920
01:39:44,060 --> 01:39:46,110
Are you still trying to hide?

921
01:39:48,110 --> 01:39:50,080
You caused me a heartache.

922
01:39:51,330 --> 01:39:56,350
You crushed my desires.
And I couldn't even know.

923
01:39:57,370 --> 01:39:59,940
You knew that I love Chandra.

924
01:40:01,150 --> 01:40:05,070
You even knew that he
loves only you.

925
01:40:06,390 --> 01:40:08,130
But you never told me.

926
01:40:09,480 --> 01:40:11,780
Is this what the world
means by 'friendship'?

927
01:40:12,630 --> 01:40:14,770
Can you still claim
to be my friend?

928
01:40:14,920 --> 01:40:17,240
It was already too late when I learned.

929
01:40:18,340 --> 01:40:21,630
I couldn't tell you.
I couldn't find the right words.

930
01:40:22,570 --> 01:40:24,060
You had proceeded very far.

931
01:40:24,700 --> 01:40:28,750
You only wanted to test your love.

932
01:40:29,520 --> 01:40:33,490
To test him and see if he
proved himself in love or not.

933
01:40:34,460 --> 01:40:39,360
You never considered how your deadly
experiment would affect me!

934
01:40:40,270 --> 01:40:45,320
I, who begins to laugh heartily,
even at a mere smile from you...

935
01:40:46,080 --> 01:40:50,690
and who begins to shed tears
upon seeing your sullen face.

936
01:41:00,270 --> 01:41:06,320
For you love is like
the first drop of rainfall.

937
01:41:08,850 --> 01:41:14,330
But for me, love is suffocating
oneself to death.

938
01:41:36,170 --> 01:41:41,520
My dreams are shattered

939
01:41:44,500 --> 01:41:49,550
The one I considered my own...

940
01:41:49,940 --> 01:41:55,370
turned out to be a stranger

941
01:42:14,540 --> 01:42:19,830
It's not the fault of others

942
01:42:20,450 --> 01:42:25,760
My loved ones have betrayed me

943
01:42:25,980 --> 01:42:31,380
Oh, what it has come to be

944
01:42:31,720 --> 01:42:36,970
My dreams are shattered

945
01:42:53,540 --> 01:42:56,300
Stop weeping, oh my heart

946
01:42:59,260 --> 01:43:01,980
Don't be disappointed

947
01:43:02,090 --> 01:43:07,390
This was destined

948
01:43:10,370 --> 01:43:15,090
Crying won't help

949
01:43:16,110 --> 01:43:21,650
This had to happen

950
01:43:21,760 --> 01:43:27,170
My dreams are shattered

951
01:43:38,370 --> 01:43:43,450
The dreams I had...

952
01:43:44,140 --> 01:43:49,460
have to be forgotten

953
01:43:52,710 --> 01:43:55,390
They'll never come true

954
01:43:58,460 --> 01:44:03,790
My dreams are shattered

955
01:44:06,810 --> 01:44:12,020
The one I love...

956
01:44:12,460 --> 01:44:17,970
doesn't love me

957
01:44:18,080 --> 01:44:23,390
My dreams are shattered

958
01:44:42,390 --> 01:44:43,910
Have you had tea?

959
01:44:44,580 --> 01:44:47,780
We asked for water but it hasn't arrived.
I wonder how long it takes for tea..

960
01:44:48,360 --> 01:44:49,850
Mohan!

961
01:44:51,210 --> 01:44:54,110
Where are you, Mohan?
There's neither water nor tea.

962
01:44:54,240 --> 01:44:56,760
What should I do? I am alone.
I just got the sweet drinks made.

963
01:44:57,100 --> 01:44:58,700
- Chander didn't come?
- No, he didn't.

964
01:44:58,860 --> 01:45:01,590
Why would he? After all,
he's the head of the house.

965
01:45:02,090 --> 01:45:04,190
Do you believe he's
the servant of this house?

966
01:45:04,320 --> 01:45:05,920
- Then what?
- Shut up, will you?

967
01:45:06,010 --> 01:45:08,130
Why should I shut up?
I've been here for twenty years.

968
01:45:08,300 --> 01:45:12,440
I asked Mr. Prakash to invest some
money and help me start a hotel...

969
01:45:13,140 --> 01:45:16,280
start a grocery shop,
or even a haircutting saloon.

970
01:45:16,440 --> 01:45:18,490
- But nothing for me.
- Get out of here.

971
01:45:18,570 --> 01:45:20,700
- I'm going.
- Why're you scolding him?

972
01:45:20,870 --> 01:45:23,830
He's right. He's a lot
better than Chander.

973
01:45:24,660 --> 01:45:26,256
He might be, in your opinion.

974
01:45:26,280 --> 01:45:28,300
But, in my opinion Chander is
much superior to me.

975
01:45:28,440 --> 01:45:30,630
- What does Chander have?
- He might not have anything.

976
01:45:31,100 --> 01:45:33,240
But he doesn't approach
anybody asking for alms.

977
01:45:33,780 --> 01:45:35,856
Only after pleading with him
a thousand times did he come here.

978
01:45:35,880 --> 01:45:38,530
I see that Chander has gained
a higher status than myself.

979
01:45:38,800 --> 01:45:41,040
He's dependent on us.
How can he compare himself with us?

980
01:45:41,230 --> 01:45:44,740
You and Chander have
your respective places.

981
01:45:45,120 --> 01:45:47,290
It doesn't mean
you can insult my friend.

982
01:45:47,460 --> 01:45:48,960
What a friend he is!

983
01:45:49,330 --> 01:45:51,680
Once you have money,
there are plenty to plunder it.

984
01:45:51,840 --> 01:45:54,380
And when you don't have money,
there are no thieves.

985
01:45:54,720 --> 01:45:58,040
Mother, you can't call my friend
a thief in my presence.

986
01:45:58,770 --> 01:46:00,570
I won't stay in this
home any longer.

987
01:46:01,190 --> 01:46:02,690
Gosh! What have I said?

988
01:46:03,050 --> 01:46:05,070
Are you in your senses, Prakash?

989
01:46:05,480 --> 01:46:08,640
At whom are you yelling?
At your mother? Aren't you ashamed?

990
01:46:09,200 --> 01:46:10,720
You shouldn't interfere in everything.

991
01:46:11,150 --> 01:46:12,850
This is a matter between
mother and me.

992
01:46:13,070 --> 01:46:15,550
Your insult is my insult.
I won't tolerate it.

993
01:46:16,680 --> 01:46:19,880
My dear, you will have
to bear it.

994
01:46:21,200 --> 01:46:24,090
If you're out to serve the poor, you
should be prepared to face insults.

995
01:46:26,950 --> 01:46:29,920
Anyway, calm yourself now.
There are guests sitting outside.

996
01:46:30,680 --> 01:46:33,630
Aha! Your future wife
will be coming today.

997
01:46:34,280 --> 01:46:37,730
Come on, smile. Or shall
I slap you? Shall I?

998
01:46:38,270 --> 01:46:39,470
Go ahead.

999
01:46:43,340 --> 01:46:46,220
I'm sorry. I was a bit delayed.
Would you like to smoke?

1000
01:46:48,060 --> 01:46:49,360
How about you?

1001
01:46:54,200 --> 01:46:55,600
- They've arrived.
- Excuse me.

1002
01:47:03,330 --> 01:47:04,950
- Greetings.
- Greetings.

1003
01:47:05,320 --> 01:47:06,720
Please come.

1004
01:47:10,840 --> 01:47:12,930
Please come.

1005
01:47:22,460 --> 01:47:25,670
Don't feel shy. He's my
best friend, Mr. Chander.

1006
01:47:25,960 --> 01:47:28,940
And she is... I've already
told you about her.

1007
01:47:28,990 --> 01:47:30,350
Please come.

1008
01:47:43,100 --> 01:47:46,320
Mother, mother, let's
leave for Jehanabad quickly.

1009
01:47:46,970 --> 01:47:51,490
Hurry up, mother. I don't
want to live here.

1010
01:47:51,940 --> 01:47:53,780
Tell me what the matter is.

1011
01:47:54,370 --> 01:47:57,450
I'll go mad, mother.
I'll go mad.

1012
01:47:57,990 --> 01:47:59,710
I told Prakash earlier...

1013
01:48:00,230 --> 01:48:04,630
the affluent atmosphere
of the city wouldn't suit me.

1014
01:48:05,130 --> 01:48:07,590
I can't tell you why
I'm going back, mother.

1015
01:48:07,890 --> 01:48:10,850
- Hurry up, hurry up!
- Come to your senses, Chander.

1016
01:48:11,890 --> 01:48:14,290
Otherwise your madness
will destroy you.

1017
01:48:17,910 --> 01:48:19,510
You'll have to tell me today.

1018
01:48:20,340 --> 01:48:22,280
Your mother is bound
to ask you today.

1019
01:48:23,100 --> 01:48:25,100
Your lifetime of silence
will show its true colors.

1020
01:48:28,900 --> 01:48:30,500
You can't remain silent any longer.

1021
01:48:30,840 --> 01:48:33,690
Otherwise I won't go,
and neither will you.

1022
01:48:33,940 --> 01:48:36,340
If you want to go,
you'll have to kill me first.

1023
01:48:36,370 --> 01:48:40,370
- Mother!
- My dear son...

1024
01:48:43,260 --> 01:48:45,620
Your blood is asking you.

1025
01:48:46,980 --> 01:48:48,180
Tell me.

1026
01:48:50,010 --> 01:48:52,250
Son, son...

1027
01:48:54,530 --> 01:48:59,370
Look, the blisters on my hand
are asking you.

1028
01:49:00,970 --> 01:49:03,650
Tell me, tell me.

1029
01:49:04,980 --> 01:49:09,910
Son, a mother's affection
is asking you.

1030
01:49:11,070 --> 01:49:14,970
Tell me, tell me, my son.

1031
01:49:17,110 --> 01:49:18,310
Tell me...

1032
01:49:19,650 --> 01:49:24,140
Mother, I've loved Lata
since childhood.

1033
01:49:25,730 --> 01:49:27,230
I know it quite well.

1034
01:49:28,550 --> 01:49:30,620
I met her again after ages.

1035
01:49:32,910 --> 01:49:35,110
She still loves me as deeply.

1036
01:49:40,210 --> 01:49:44,620
But today my eyes saw something.

1037
01:49:46,660 --> 01:49:49,040
My ears have heard something, mother.

1038
01:49:54,790 --> 01:49:56,820
Her marriage has been
arranged to Prakash.

1039
01:49:58,050 --> 01:49:59,550
What do you want now?

1040
01:50:00,730 --> 01:50:02,040
I want everything.

1041
01:50:03,750 --> 01:50:05,340
Everything is possible.

1042
01:50:07,010 --> 01:50:11,680
But I don't want anything.
Nothing is possible.

1043
01:50:13,490 --> 01:50:16,830
Not only I, but even you are
under obligation to Prakash.

1044
01:50:18,910 --> 01:50:25,780
A poor mother's self-respecting
son wants to repay the obligations...

1045
01:50:25,830 --> 01:50:28,540
in the form of
sacrificing his love.

1046
01:50:29,720 --> 01:50:31,120
Bless you, my son.

1047
01:50:32,300 --> 01:50:34,010
I expected this of you.

1048
01:50:35,910 --> 01:50:38,170
I told you during your childhood...

1049
01:50:39,630 --> 01:50:41,430
that Lata was the daughter
of a rich father...

1050
01:50:42,380 --> 01:50:45,220
and would be be married
to some affluent man.

1051
01:50:46,190 --> 01:50:48,310
Mother, let's go to
Jehanabad quickly.

1052
01:50:49,850 --> 01:50:52,940
It's better that a poor man
be settled far...

1053
01:50:52,990 --> 01:50:55,480
from the afflent as soon as possible.

1054
01:50:55,790 --> 01:50:57,290
Let's go, mother. Come on.

1055
01:51:10,190 --> 01:51:11,690
What are you thinking, Lata?

1056
01:51:11,970 --> 01:51:15,270
Love is a storm.
A storm cares for nothing.

1057
01:51:15,650 --> 01:51:18,980
A storm is bounded
by neither time nor place.

1058
01:51:19,320 --> 01:51:20,720
A storm equally affects...

1059
01:51:20,760 --> 01:51:24,320
the poor people's huts,
and the rich people's mansions.

1060
01:51:41,600 --> 01:51:43,950
Have courage.
Take your step forward.

1061
01:51:44,640 --> 01:51:49,200
Love is calling out to you.

1062
01:51:49,900 --> 01:51:54,880
Chander's diminishing life
is calling out to you.

1063
01:51:57,040 --> 01:52:00,270
Where are you going?
You shouldn't be going.

1064
01:52:01,040 --> 01:52:02,870
You're ruining this family.

1065
01:52:03,330 --> 01:52:06,710
You are murdering the hopes
of your mother and father.

1066
01:52:07,300 --> 01:52:12,620
You are bringing a bad
name to your family.

1067
01:52:13,310 --> 01:52:16,350
This home's destruction
is asking you to turn back.

1068
01:52:17,180 --> 01:52:19,920
Respect is begging you to return.

1069
01:52:20,480 --> 01:52:23,550
Mother's love is calling out
to you to turn back.

1070
01:52:49,860 --> 01:52:55,520
God, what did you get
by breaking my heart?

1071
01:52:55,890 --> 01:53:01,260
My desires are unfulfilled

1072
01:53:19,150 --> 01:53:24,720
I thought I'd get the love of my life

1073
01:53:25,320 --> 01:53:30,820
I'd spend my life with him

1074
01:53:33,830 --> 01:53:39,360
I didn't know you'd separate us...

1075
01:53:39,710 --> 01:53:45,530
and leave my dreams shattered

1076
01:53:45,790 --> 01:53:51,180
My desires are unfulfilled

1077
01:53:51,560 --> 01:53:54,170
God, why did you do this?

1078
01:54:00,300 --> 01:54:04,270
God is not the only one at fault

1079
01:54:04,660 --> 01:54:07,380
It's the world, too

1080
01:54:07,500 --> 01:54:12,180
The aggrieved ones...

1081
01:54:12,420 --> 01:54:15,290
never find peace

1082
01:54:20,680 --> 01:54:26,240
I'd rather die
than live this life

1083
01:54:26,690 --> 01:54:32,370
I've lost the one I love

1084
01:54:32,760 --> 01:54:38,090
My desires are unfulfilled

1085
01:54:38,470 --> 01:54:41,160
God, why did you do this?

1086
01:54:47,190 --> 01:54:50,450
I didn't know...

1087
01:54:50,490 --> 01:54:54,090
our love would meet a horrible death

1088
01:54:55,900 --> 01:55:01,340
I had no idea...

1089
01:55:01,720 --> 01:55:04,950
love would ruin me some day

1090
01:55:07,520 --> 01:55:13,040
I never expected, oh Boatswain...

1091
01:55:13,450 --> 01:55:19,070
that You would sink
my boat of love

1092
01:55:19,380 --> 01:55:24,710
My desires are unfulfilled

1093
01:55:25,110 --> 01:55:27,730
God, why did you do this?

1094
01:55:28,090 --> 01:55:33,490
God, what did you get
by breaking my heart?

1095
01:55:33,880 --> 01:55:39,540
Why did you shatter my dreams?

1096
01:56:27,780 --> 01:56:30,600
Doctor, doctor.

1097
01:56:32,450 --> 01:56:35,730
Doctor, doctor.

1098
01:56:37,700 --> 01:56:40,020
- What's the matter, Chander?
- My mother is dying, doctor.

1099
01:56:40,140 --> 01:56:41,640
For god's sake, save her!

1100
01:56:41,850 --> 01:56:46,530
Hurry up, Doctor. Why are you
staring at my face? Come quickly.

1101
01:56:50,220 --> 01:56:53,720
Where are you?
Where are you, my son?

1102
01:56:55,240 --> 01:56:57,940
Where have you gone,
leaving me all alone?

1103
01:57:06,720 --> 01:57:09,110
This empty home is killing me.

1104
01:57:11,010 --> 01:57:12,760
Why doesn't someone come to me?

1105
01:57:15,550 --> 01:57:16,850
Who is coming?

1106
01:57:18,690 --> 01:57:20,090
Who is this coming?

1107
01:57:21,500 --> 01:57:23,380
Why doesn't the approaching
person say anything?

1108
01:57:32,480 --> 01:57:33,580
You?

1109
01:57:35,450 --> 01:57:39,130
It's you, my husband?
You have come?

1110
01:57:40,980 --> 01:57:42,880
You heard my calls?

1111
01:57:45,170 --> 01:57:46,770
You have come to take me?

1112
01:57:49,520 --> 01:57:51,470
I am unable to get up.

1113
01:57:54,560 --> 01:57:55,760
Lift me.

1114
01:57:59,550 --> 01:58:01,450
Lift me and take me away.

1115
01:58:03,840 --> 01:58:06,030
Lift me and take me away.

1116
01:58:07,520 --> 01:58:09,130
Take me away.

1117
01:58:13,140 --> 01:58:16,940
Mother, I've brought the doctor.
You will recover soon.

1118
01:58:19,080 --> 01:58:20,180
Mother?

1119
01:58:20,220 --> 01:58:21,940
Mother!

1120
01:58:31,650 --> 01:58:34,270
Mother!

1121
01:58:36,470 --> 01:58:38,950
You, too, left me after
getting fed up with me, mother?

1122
01:58:42,280 --> 01:58:44,470
I was living depending on you.

1123
01:58:48,050 --> 01:58:52,180
I remember, I often used to
go away, leaving you alone.

1124
01:58:54,950 --> 01:59:01,720
But today, you left me
and went away, mother!

1125
01:59:21,450 --> 01:59:23,330
I have no one to turn to

1126
01:59:33,530 --> 01:59:37,840
Everything has been
taken away from me

1127
01:59:45,590 --> 01:59:49,980
My heart is broken
and my hopes are shattered

1128
01:59:50,290 --> 01:59:54,410
I'm all alone in the world

1129
02:00:04,510 --> 02:00:09,650
My life is full of sorrow
and darkness

1130
02:00:17,540 --> 02:00:20,630
I have no one to turn to

1131
02:00:28,210 --> 02:00:32,810
Will my sorrows never end?

1132
02:00:54,200 --> 02:00:59,450
People say after every night
comes the dawn

1133
02:01:00,060 --> 02:01:03,180
But I have no one to turn to

1134
02:01:15,340 --> 02:01:19,100
God, you've taken everything away

1135
02:01:19,540 --> 02:01:23,640
The world has harassed me

1136
02:01:38,520 --> 02:01:43,860
You tell me if this is justice

1137
02:01:51,340 --> 02:01:54,730
I have no one to turn to

1138
02:01:54,850 --> 02:01:59,090
Tell me who to turn to

1139
02:02:01,810 --> 02:02:05,870
Everything has been taken away from me

1140
02:02:14,320 --> 02:02:18,580
Congratulations on the marriage!

1141
02:02:23,540 --> 02:02:25,570
You haven't got ready yet?

1142
02:02:27,820 --> 02:02:29,420
Today is the marriage day, son.

1143
02:02:30,340 --> 02:02:33,790
- I remember it very well.
- I'm telling you the truth, son.

1144
02:02:34,550 --> 02:02:38,980
I sent Mohan to Jehanabad.
But Chander can't be found.

1145
02:02:39,630 --> 02:02:41,230
After all you said that day...

1146
02:02:41,970 --> 02:02:43,740
no self-respecting man
can come to this home.

1147
02:02:44,190 --> 02:02:46,710
Don't talk like that
on this joyous day.

1148
02:02:47,300 --> 02:02:49,460
The world will get a chance
to laugh at us.

1149
02:02:50,100 --> 02:02:52,320
A human being gets to face
the consequences...

1150
02:02:52,890 --> 02:02:54,870
of all good and evil deeds
in the same lifetime.

1151
02:02:55,060 --> 02:02:57,420
Both, hell and heaven,
are right here.

1152
02:02:58,150 --> 02:03:03,200
You hurt Chander, and God has hurt
you on this joyous occasion.

1153
02:03:04,990 --> 02:03:08,720
Don't talk like this. This is
the only joyous occasion.

1154
02:03:09,300 --> 02:03:14,450
You can eliminate every
misery in life with money.

1155
02:03:15,080 --> 02:03:16,380
Just think, mother.

1156
02:03:17,210 --> 02:03:19,050
What must those poor people
be going through...

1157
02:03:20,580 --> 02:03:22,050
who have no happiness...

1158
02:03:23,570 --> 02:03:26,030
who can't buy happiness with money...

1159
02:03:26,480 --> 02:03:29,030
those who are alive only on the
strength of our kind words?

1160
02:03:30,900 --> 02:03:32,400
I was mistaken, son.

1161
02:03:33,040 --> 02:03:35,530
If Chander comes,
I'll ask him to pardon me.

1162
02:03:35,760 --> 02:03:37,426
After somebody's death...

1163
02:03:37,450 --> 02:03:39,410
you're now feeling
you were mistaken?

1164
02:03:40,150 --> 02:03:42,050
Chander will never come
in this home ever again.

1165
02:03:42,610 --> 02:03:45,170
- He is dead for this home.
- What will happen now, son?

1166
02:03:45,570 --> 02:03:47,270
The only atonement for this will be...

1167
02:03:47,830 --> 02:03:49,760
to take an oath in the
name of God and pledge...

1168
02:03:50,370 --> 02:03:52,990
not to marry until my friend returns.

1169
02:03:53,500 --> 02:03:55,000
I will definitely not marry.

1170
02:03:58,790 --> 02:04:01,940
Prakash, I have come!

1171
02:04:08,340 --> 02:04:10,280
Why are you angry at your mother?

1172
02:04:11,960 --> 02:04:17,390
It's your marriage day today.

1173
02:04:40,150 --> 02:04:41,350
Congratulations, Prakash.

1174
02:04:41,920 --> 02:04:45,660
Congratulations, Prakash.

1175
02:04:50,960 --> 02:04:52,260
You've come, Basanti?

1176
02:04:53,810 --> 02:04:55,310
It's nice that you've come.

1177
02:04:56,600 --> 02:04:59,010
Now your heart must
have become clear.

1178
02:05:00,780 --> 02:05:02,280
Why don't you answer me?

1179
02:05:02,610 --> 02:05:04,680
Hey! Why are you roaming
around all alone?

1180
02:05:05,700 --> 02:05:07,100
I was right here.

1181
02:05:07,510 --> 02:05:10,200
Gosh! I forgot to
give the gift.

1182
02:05:11,460 --> 02:05:12,760
Gift? To me?

1183
02:05:12,980 --> 02:05:15,810
I always have good
wishes for you, Prakash.

1184
02:05:17,470 --> 02:05:20,420
So say that you want to present
a gift to my wife. Come on.

02:05:28,850 --> 02:05:30,150
Congratulations, Lata.

1186
02:05:32,220 --> 02:05:34,840
Only one thing used to listen
to the heartbeats.

1187
02:05:36,850 --> 02:05:38,450
I'll give that thing to you.

1188
02:05:42,850 --> 02:05:44,450
I hope you will accept it.

1189
02:05:52,020 --> 02:05:53,720
I'm making a request of you today.

1190
02:06:04,600 --> 02:06:06,250
I'm giving you half my miseries.

1191
02:06:08,190 --> 02:06:10,180
I hope you, too, will accept.
