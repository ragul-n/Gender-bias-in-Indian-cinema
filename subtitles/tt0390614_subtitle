1
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,179
Laxman...

2
00:01:38,656 --> 00:01:40,920
the kids' bus has arrived.
Bring them in

3
00:01:42,627 --> 00:01:45,255
The kids? Or the bus?
- The kids

4
00:01:46,964 --> 00:01:49,660
Now...?
- Yes. Now

5
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:53,867
Which means...?

6
00:01:54,305 --> 00:01:58,901
Laxman, go out and bring
the children in. Now

7
00:02:09,787 --> 00:02:13,223
What are you doing? Let the gifts be.
Babu will pack them

8
00:02:13,624 --> 00:02:15,558
No, Sumi, let me also learn this

9
00:02:15,993 --> 00:02:20,896
l want to personally pack the first gift
we'll give to our grandson

10
00:02:21,232 --> 00:02:23,894
Grandson? First let your
own son grow up

11
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:27,162
Till then, amuse yourself with
the kids you call your grandchildren

12
00:02:27,905 --> 00:02:29,668
Hurry... your little friends
have arrived

13
00:02:33,144 --> 00:02:35,772
Welcome! Welcome!

14
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:38,138
Come to me...!

15
00:02:40,718 --> 00:02:45,246
Look ! There are gifts for you !
Go and collect them. Quick!

16
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:56,092
Hello, son

17
00:02:57,368 --> 00:03:01,134
See that air-filled house over there?
How about jumping with me?

18
00:03:01,606 --> 00:03:05,235
No, l suffer from polio.
l can't even walk properly

19
00:03:05,676 --> 00:03:09,271
Never mind. l'm with you.
We'll have fun together. C'mon

20
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:16,980
Hey Sumi! This is how the three
of us will rock someday!

21
00:03:17,922 --> 00:03:21,653
You, me and Adi's son !

22
00:03:28,733 --> 00:03:30,564
Can't you make it quicker, mister?

23
00:03:30,935 --> 00:03:33,096
l own a camel. lt's not a horse!

24
00:03:33,604 --> 00:03:37,165
As if the camel knows that!
Make it faster! Good!

25
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:46,313
Pooja...

26
00:03:52,556 --> 00:03:54,524
For me?
- No, it's for me!

27
00:03:54,725 --> 00:03:57,922
lt's a bit tight. But when l step
out in a ghagra-choli...

28
00:03:58,262 --> 00:04:00,526
the cat-whistles people let out...
- Ha ha ha! Very funny!

29
00:04:01,565 --> 00:04:03,863
lt looks expensive.
- No. Worth just 45,000

30
00:04:04,568 --> 00:04:06,763
Just 45,000 ?
That's very reasonable

31
00:04:07,605 --> 00:04:10,540
Try it on.
- How can l wear it?

32
00:04:10,741 --> 00:04:12,971
Why not?
- The henna's still wet

33
00:04:13,377 --> 00:04:16,073
So take it off.
- No, l applied it for you

34
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:20,141
Dad chartered a plane for just one day.
We haven't time to go and exchange it

35
00:04:20,651 --> 00:04:22,551
But how can l wear it, Adi?

36
00:04:28,592 --> 00:04:30,560
Want me... to dress you?

37
00:04:32,596 --> 00:04:35,224
Want me to dress you up?
- No!

38
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:41,094
Why? l'll close my eyes, l promise.
l'll play blind. That's it

39
00:04:42,606 --> 00:04:45,040
No, Adi... no way!
- l swear it on daddy

40
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:48,136
You know, l wouldn't take
a false oath on daddy

41
00:04:57,555 --> 00:04:59,887
''Go into hiding...''

42
00:05:01,659 --> 00:05:03,627
''hide somewhere...''

43
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:11,535
''my crazy heart
will still find you''

44
00:05:17,575 --> 00:05:21,067
''l'm moving away,
l'm leaving...''

45
00:05:21,645 --> 00:05:25,046
''l'm better of
being away from you''

46
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:31,983
''There's mischief in your heart''

47
00:05:33,591 --> 00:05:39,552
''My heart...
l can't control anymore''

48
00:05:41,932 --> 00:05:43,957
''Go into hiding...''

49
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:47,935
''hide somewhere...''

50
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:55,509
''my crazy heart
will find you''

51
00:06:29,647 --> 00:06:35,813
''l feel so shy''

52
00:06:37,788 --> 00:06:44,990
''You ought not to be shy
of those you love''

53
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:49,223
''Go away...''

54
00:06:50,101 --> 00:06:52,001
''go on, my love''

55
00:06:54,138 --> 00:07:00,907
''There's deceit in
the air...''

56
00:07:02,113 --> 00:07:08,848
''l can barely contain my desires''

57
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:16,187
''Don't make my heart
beat wildly, my love...''

58
00:07:17,027 --> 00:07:20,519
''don't give me a scare, my love...''

59
00:07:20,865 --> 00:07:23,527
''Come to me...''

60
00:07:24,568 --> 00:07:26,536
''stop being stubborn''

61
00:07:29,006 --> 00:07:35,309
''Don't please squeeze my arm''

62
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:16,051
''Look...''

63
00:08:16,687 --> 00:08:18,655
''there's a scare in my heart''

64
00:08:20,891 --> 00:08:28,195
''But what are you
afraid of?''

65
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:32,531
''Let me go...''

66
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:35,766
''stop acting crazy''

67
00:08:37,107 --> 00:08:44,206
''l know it
deep down in my heart...''

68
00:08:45,282 --> 00:08:51,846
''my obsession,
you will surely understand''

69
00:08:56,227 --> 00:08:59,492
''l haven't a clue of it...''

70
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:03,491
''if you could explain
it to me, sweetheart?''

71
00:09:03,968 --> 00:09:09,497
''Don't act so innocent now''

72
00:09:11,976 --> 00:09:14,945
''l implore you...''

73
00:09:15,546 --> 00:09:18,515
''let me go''

74
00:09:20,217 --> 00:09:22,185
''Go into hiding...''

75
00:09:24,321 --> 00:09:26,186
''hide somewhere...''

76
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:34,191
''my crazy heart
will look for you''

77
00:09:37,568 --> 00:09:39,866
Adi! lt's perfect!
- lsn't it?

78
00:09:40,971 --> 00:09:43,531
And l think you're more perfect

79
00:09:44,942 --> 00:09:46,910
l love you.
- l love you, too

80
00:09:57,688 --> 00:09:58,916
What happened?
- The bite!

81
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:00,921
When did l bite you?
- The watch, l mean !

82
00:10:01,158 --> 00:10:03,217
lt's already 11.
l got to be in Mumbai by 2, Adi!

83
00:10:03,594 --> 00:10:07,052
Why're you so worried? The flight
literally belongs to my old man today!

84
00:10:13,003 --> 00:10:15,563
Mind-blowing, dad!
The trip was mind-blowing!

85
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:19,565
Not that one, that one is raw.
Eat this... this is a ripe one

86
00:10:19,943 --> 00:10:22,070
What difference, dad...?
They're the same colour

87
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,238
lt isn't the colour, son.
lt's the aroma

88
00:10:24,615 --> 00:10:27,584
You tell a good mango from
its smell. Here you are

89
00:10:28,285 --> 00:10:31,152
Useless fellow! You've been coming
to the farm for the last 25 years

90
00:10:31,622 --> 00:10:33,590
And you still can't tell a good mango!

91
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:38,117
With an expert like you around, why
must l worry? This is mind-blowing!

92
00:10:38,629 --> 00:10:40,927
There's a crate for your friends.
Don't forget it

93
00:10:41,632 --> 00:10:44,601
And what did your friends have to say?
Who else went with you to Jaisalmer?

94
00:10:47,638 --> 00:10:51,972
Well, there was Hari,
Raj, Happy...

95
00:10:52,676 --> 00:10:55,076
Your mother was furious.
But l side-stepped the issue

96
00:10:56,013 --> 00:10:58,538
You didn't tell her that l chartered
a plane for you, did you?

97
00:10:58,882 --> 00:11:03,012
No, l didn't. Am l out of my mind
to tell Mother lndia about it, dad?

98
00:11:03,587 --> 00:11:05,555
You know what Mother lndia
would have to say

99
00:11:05,923 --> 00:11:09,984
Aditya! You've blown up 1.5 million
in just a single day!

100
00:11:10,594 --> 00:11:13,927
lshwar, how could you give this useless
son of yours a chartered plane?

101
00:11:14,365 --> 00:11:17,129
''lshwar, this boy spends
money like water''

102
00:11:17,668 --> 00:11:19,636
''And we've never been so liberal
even with water''

103
00:11:19,937 --> 00:11:21,905
Mother lndia!

104
00:11:23,941 --> 00:11:25,909
Sumi... so you've overheard?

105
00:11:27,177 --> 00:11:29,042
Yes, she has overheard!
Do something, quick!

106
00:11:29,613 --> 00:11:33,572
Mom, it wasn't dad's fault.
l insisted on a chartered plane

107
00:11:33,951 --> 00:11:37,944
Yes, Sumi. He had promised to take his
friends to Jaisalmer on a chartered plane

108
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:40,586
And how could he break a promise?
- Why...?

109
00:11:41,258 --> 00:11:43,226
Haven't you taught him
how to break promises?

110
00:11:43,694 --> 00:11:45,992
You're so good at breaking promises.
- Me...?

111
00:11:46,363 --> 00:11:48,593
Yes. You make promises and
break them every day

112
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:52,596
''That's it, Sumi. l'm going to stop
spending money on Adi's indulgences''

113
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:56,531
''l promise. l also promise not to
buy him another bike''

114
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:59,909
''And his everyday parties at 5-star
hotels are off... l promise''

115
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:02,544
Ma, l...
- Better if you don't talk to me!

116
00:12:04,848 --> 00:12:09,148
l was talking about this tree.
When it was one year old...

117
00:12:09,386 --> 00:12:13,880
lt has grown up. And it also
realises its responsibilities

118
00:12:14,992 --> 00:12:18,018
The gardener looked after it. So it is
repaying a debt by bearing fruit now

119
00:12:18,595 --> 00:12:21,564
Do you understand?
- Aditya will bear it too... the fruit

120
00:12:22,599 --> 00:12:26,558
Sumi, Aditya has changed.
l mean, he's in the process of changing

121
00:12:27,604 --> 00:12:29,572
Have some patience, Ma. l...
- For how long?

122
00:12:30,107 --> 00:12:33,565
20 years more? Or 25 ?
- Taking a dig, eh?

123
00:12:33,844 --> 00:12:38,577
Here, look at my photographs!
They'll appear in top magazines

124
00:12:38,816 --> 00:12:41,250
Producers are betting their shirts
to sign me. You'll see...

125
00:12:41,618 --> 00:12:45,054
Why, Adi? Why would
the producers sign you?

126
00:12:45,622 --> 00:12:48,591
Well.. because l'm good-looking...

127
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:53,928
l'm rich and...
- You're lucky!

128
00:12:54,264 --> 00:12:56,528
Yes, l'm lucky.
- Wait and see, Sumi

129
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:59,960
This boy will feature in our
ad for the toys

130
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:03,540
As you know, as a postman earlier,
l used to give people their letters

131
00:13:04,908 --> 00:13:07,536
And this boy will
get tons of fan-mail!

132
00:13:07,845 --> 00:13:10,973
After all l'm a star, Mom!
Look at the lines on my palm!

133
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:15,541
They reach out to the very end!
- Don't trust the lines so much, Aditya

134
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:18,813
They seem to imply one thing,
and give you quite another

135
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:22,221
Pretty serious, isn't she?

136
00:13:22,926 --> 00:13:23,893
Mother lndia!

137
00:13:32,302 --> 00:13:33,269
Excuse me...

138
00:13:35,973 --> 00:13:37,736
What a pretty sari.
- Thanks

139
00:13:37,941 --> 00:13:39,909
But it's ordinary compared to yours!

140
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:42,909
That trademark flower-band in
your hair looks very pretty

141
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:47,175
lt's lshwar's gift, literally.
He personally brings one for me everyday

142
00:13:47,417 --> 00:13:52,753
ls that all? A measly flowerband?
l give my Ashalata a bouquet everyday!

143
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:56,593
Really? Does your wife go around
with a bouquet in her hair everyday?

144
00:13:57,561 --> 00:13:59,791
The two of them are at it again.
Shall we...?

145
00:14:01,331 --> 00:14:03,094
Wasn't me, it was Natu who took off

146
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,530
He says, ''That's nothing''
at everything anyone says...

147
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:08,900
So Mr Naidu...?
What are you gentlemen discussing?

148
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:14,975
My son Venkat! He wants to ignore
my hotel business and turn a Pop singer

149
00:14:15,579 --> 00:14:17,137
l spent half a million rupees!

150
00:14:17,581 --> 00:14:20,880
''You're pregnant,
l'm a beggar at heart...''

151
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:23,878
To record that cursed song,
he had six sessions!

152
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:27,882
That's happening in every family.
- But that's very good, Mr Naidu

153
00:14:28,091 --> 00:14:30,059
You ought to be happy with your son,
his cassettes are selling quickly

154
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:32,125
Two cassettes! Only 2 cassettes!

155
00:14:32,596 --> 00:14:34,564
l bought a cassette
which got spoilt

156
00:14:34,865 --> 00:14:37,095
So l was the one who bought
the second cassette, too!

157
00:14:37,601 --> 00:14:39,899
He's forgotten all about
his education and learning!

158
00:14:40,604 --> 00:14:43,903
That's really sad, really sad.
But we're very lucky in this respect

159
00:14:44,308 --> 00:14:46,242
Our son Adi wants to become
a film actor

160
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:48,578
But he's completing his education.
He stands first in the college every year

161
00:14:48,912 --> 00:14:53,940
That's nothing! Ashalata's niece
came first in college every day!

162
00:14:54,551 --> 00:14:57,520
Hear that...? Every day!
- Every day!

163
00:14:57,921 --> 00:15:00,219
For the 8 'o clock classes,
she got to the college at 6 !

164
00:15:01,558 --> 00:15:04,186
That's very nice, Natu-bhai!
You know something...?

165
00:15:04,628 --> 00:15:08,928
My son stands first in studies and also
first in drama-competitions every year

166
00:15:09,299 --> 00:15:11,995
He's really a very good actor!
- That's nothing

167
00:15:12,569 --> 00:15:14,901
Ashalata's nephew is
the greatest actor

168
00:15:15,272 --> 00:15:17,240
He played a mailbox in
one of his school plays

169
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:19,869
He gave such a superb performance...

170
00:15:20,243 --> 00:15:22,211
people thrust their letters
in his mouth even today!

171
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:25,548
Your son is nothing!
- What was that...?

172
00:15:25,916 --> 00:15:29,875
My daughter is like Einstein in brains
and Aishwarya in beauty! One of a kind!

173
00:15:30,921 --> 00:15:34,618
Your son's a big zero. He's dumb!
- He's had too much to drink, lady...

174
00:15:34,925 --> 00:15:37,553
take care of him, else...
- l'll take care of him

175
00:15:37,794 --> 00:15:39,887
What's wrong with him, Sumi?
He gets started at just any place!

176
00:15:40,631 --> 00:15:42,895
He took off at Agarwal's
funeral the other day

177
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:44,793
''What...? Just a thousand people?''

178
00:15:45,002 --> 00:15:47,903
''There were 5000 people
at my uncle's funeral''

179
00:15:48,205 --> 00:15:50,036
He must've been joking.
- What joking!

180
00:15:50,874 --> 00:15:52,671
He took off on the lenses of
someone's glasses the other day

181
00:15:52,909 --> 00:15:55,878
l said, the peon in my office
can't see without his glasses

182
00:15:56,213 --> 00:15:58,044
And Natu the great says...

183
00:15:58,348 --> 00:16:00,839
the peon in my office
goes deaf without his glasses!

184
00:16:01,151 --> 00:16:03,642
l asked, ''Why? Does he
use his glasses for hearing?''

185
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,253
He says, ''No, he uses a hearing-aid.
He needs glasses to find the hearing aid''

186
00:16:08,558 --> 00:16:10,526
What are you laughing for?
- But he's got a point

187
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:13,855
He's got a point all the time, Sumi!
My grandpa's great! My Uncle's great!

188
00:16:14,064 --> 00:16:16,191
And my Ashalata...
absolutely original!

189
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,531
Sure. As if our wives
are all duplicates!

190
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:21,533
Let him be.
- There we were, talking about Adi and...

191
00:16:21,905 --> 00:16:23,202
Your Adi...

192
00:16:24,574 --> 00:16:26,542
he's nothing! He's a zero!

193
00:16:26,977 --> 00:16:31,004
He's good for nothing, take it
from me. l know that wastrel!

194
00:16:31,581 --> 00:16:33,071
Will you listen to me...
please step aside

195
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:42,558
You tossed me into
the swimming pool...?

196
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:44,927
But this is nothing!

197
00:16:46,263 --> 00:16:48,561
My brother-in-law
threw me in the sea!

198
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:08,511
Don't laugh, Sumi
- ''No offense towards my dad,'' l heard

199
00:17:08,885 --> 00:17:10,853
But no offense against my son?
l hadn't heard that

200
00:17:11,054 --> 00:17:15,514
He said it twice! Aditya is nothing!
Whereas my Aditya is...

201
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:17,521
What is he?

202
00:17:17,894 --> 00:17:19,862
What is your Aditya?

203
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:27,967
Natu-bhai said nothing wrong, lshu.
Aditya's really nothing

204
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:35,167
And he'll become nothing either.
You know why?

205
00:17:37,581 --> 00:17:39,708
Because you want to pamper
your darling son

206
00:17:40,016 --> 00:17:44,976
So mustn't l love my son?
- Hey! As if l don't love Aditya

207
00:17:45,989 --> 00:17:49,652
But that doesn't mean we succumb
to each of his whims and fancies

208
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:54,092
1.5 million rupees in a single day
on a chartered flight, lshu...?!

209
00:17:56,533 --> 00:18:00,162
Why shouldn't l fulfill all his
wishes, Sumi? Why shouldn't l do it?

210
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:03,836
What did we have when
we came to this city?

211
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:07,840
We had no roof over our heads,
we didn't have enough to eat

212
00:18:08,311 --> 00:18:10,836
We were terrified when we thought
of fulfilling a desire of ours

213
00:18:11,248 --> 00:18:13,842
ln fact, we even thought
our dreams were expensive!

214
00:18:14,317 --> 00:18:19,846
But today, if this postman who went
around delivering people's letters...

215
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:22,524
has become a rich businessman...

216
00:18:22,826 --> 00:18:25,954
it's because of his son
and offspring, Aditya

217
00:18:26,363 --> 00:18:28,524
l've built all this
only for Aditya

218
00:18:29,332 --> 00:18:31,800
Will you continue doing it
all his life?

219
00:18:45,949 --> 00:18:48,008
lshu, you know what
problems we're going through

220
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:51,486
So what am l expected to do?
- Tell Adi the truth, lshwar

221
00:18:59,529 --> 00:19:00,496
No

222
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,160
Before someone else tells him...
- No, Sumi

223
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:10,566
Nobody, except you and me,
knows about it. And if...

224
00:19:10,907 --> 00:19:13,102
But you have to tell him someday,
don't you?

225
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:17,045
He won't be able to bear the shock.
- He will have to

226
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:22,908
Maybe it'll make him change,
he'll become more responsible?

227
00:19:23,253 --> 00:19:24,515
Sumi...

228
00:19:30,293 --> 00:19:33,524
l don't like that look!
- l have a way!

229
00:20:51,574 --> 00:20:57,535
''We're emperors
of our world...''

230
00:20:57,981 --> 00:21:04,887
''our world's full of fun''

231
00:21:05,322 --> 00:21:11,158
''We're emperors
of our world...''

232
00:21:11,828 --> 00:21:18,563
''our world's full of fun''

233
00:21:18,935 --> 00:21:25,067
''We've seen off our woes...''

234
00:21:25,709 --> 00:21:31,978
''we hardly find time
from our happiness''

235
00:22:15,291 --> 00:22:20,558
''Every prank of yours,
l've been part of''

236
00:22:25,602 --> 00:22:30,904
''From you l learnt to make
the most of a fun-filled life''

237
00:22:35,078 --> 00:22:39,742
''l'm going crazy''

238
00:22:41,718 --> 00:22:47,588
''Father and son, we always were.
But we're friends too''

239
00:22:48,191 --> 00:22:54,528
''Ever since you have arrived,
l have rediscovered...''

240
00:22:54,898 --> 00:23:01,531
''my younger days in you''

241
00:23:01,971 --> 00:23:08,206
''We're emperors
of our world...''

242
00:23:08,845 --> 00:23:15,546
''our world's full of fun''

243
00:23:51,554 --> 00:23:54,079
''From you l got my life...''

244
00:23:54,557 --> 00:23:56,957
''from you, l got this world''

245
00:24:01,564 --> 00:24:06,934
''This world would've meant nothing
had you not been part of it''

246
00:24:11,307 --> 00:24:15,869
''Every hardship is behind us''

247
00:24:17,981 --> 00:24:22,543
''Our destinies are one now''

248
00:24:24,587 --> 00:24:30,890
''We have no grudge,
nor complaints...''

249
00:24:31,227 --> 00:24:37,826
''we have everything
we ever wanted''

250
00:24:38,401 --> 00:24:44,567
''We're emperors
of our world...''

251
00:24:45,041 --> 00:24:51,503
''our world's full of fun''

252
00:24:52,048 --> 00:24:58,248
''We've seen off our woes...''

253
00:24:58,888 --> 00:25:04,952
''we barely find time
from our joys''

254
00:25:21,844 --> 00:25:23,539
Good shot, dad

255
00:25:30,587 --> 00:25:34,148
Adi, l've decided to get you married
to Richa, my friend Pratap's daughter

256
00:25:35,291 --> 00:25:37,156
We're meeting at the club
at 5 tomorrow. Be there

257
00:25:37,961 --> 00:25:39,223
Dad...
- Don't refuse, Adi

258
00:25:39,596 --> 00:25:42,565
She's a very nice girl.
You will have to agree

259
00:25:42,999 --> 00:25:45,559
You'll be there, won't you?
- How can l refuse you, dad?

260
00:25:59,582 --> 00:26:01,846
What's this, Adi...?
You're not even reacting

261
00:26:02,318 --> 00:26:05,185
My Papa's had a heated swimming pool
built for me right in my bedroom

262
00:26:07,557 --> 00:26:09,923
l can now swim even in winter.
With you

263
00:26:10,593 --> 00:26:12,959
You know l love you, right?
Love you, love you, love you !

264
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:17,199
l love you too, Pooja
- Why are you sounding so sad...?

265
00:26:18,568 --> 00:26:20,866
Guess what, darling?
There's no one at home tonight

266
00:26:21,671 --> 00:26:25,129
You've been really pampered, haven't you?
- Sure. l'm my father's only daughter

267
00:26:25,908 --> 00:26:28,274
So how will you leave this house
and move into mine?

268
00:26:28,978 --> 00:26:30,707
Well....? Why can't l?

269
00:26:31,047 --> 00:26:35,211
You have a heated swimming-pool.
And l have just an ordinary pool

270
00:26:35,818 --> 00:26:37,786
As if l was born
in a heated swimming pool!

271
00:26:39,322 --> 00:26:41,552
l'll manage with
a simple swimming pool

272
00:26:43,593 --> 00:26:46,562
You have 12 bedrooms in your bungalow.
And l have just 7

273
00:26:46,763 --> 00:26:49,561
The poor manage with just
2 bedrooms, don't they?

274
00:26:49,866 --> 00:26:52,494
ln any case, l'll live
wherever you are. Right?

275
00:26:52,869 --> 00:26:55,497
For your sake, l'd live even
in a 4-bedroom place

276
00:26:55,738 --> 00:26:57,501
When the chauffeur's not around,
you'll have to drive on your own

277
00:26:57,774 --> 00:27:01,073
Teach me. l'll drive on my own.
Even an lndian car. Okay?

278
00:27:01,311 --> 00:27:04,838
What if we don't have a cook?
- We'll get food from the restaurants!

279
00:27:05,615 --> 00:27:07,207
Because l love you, baby

280
00:27:07,617 --> 00:27:10,085
Now tell me what you wanted to.
- Pooja...

281
00:27:11,554 --> 00:27:16,617
Daddy's fixing my wedding with his
friend Pratap's daughter this evening

282
00:27:17,927 --> 00:27:20,623
And l just couldn't turn
my father down, Pooja

283
00:27:20,963 --> 00:27:23,625
Aditya never refuses me.
Right...?

284
00:27:23,866 --> 00:27:25,527
Right. Unless he hears
what you're saying

285
00:27:25,768 --> 00:27:29,135
Must you joke even now...?
You tell me, Richa

286
00:27:29,372 --> 00:27:31,033
You've met Adi already.
What do you think of him?

287
00:27:31,207 --> 00:27:34,142
l don't know. l mean,
l found Adi very funny

288
00:27:34,677 --> 00:27:38,010
l found him to be very jovial.
- Exactly! He's very jovial

289
00:27:38,581 --> 00:27:40,776
He's a born comedian.
- Born comedian...?

290
00:27:41,017 --> 00:27:43,884
That's nothing.
l was an unborn comedian

291
00:27:45,021 --> 00:27:46,886
The moment l was born...
- The comic bandwagon took off...?!

292
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:50,651
People were rolling with laughter!
''Look what's born !''

293
00:27:50,893 --> 00:27:52,724
Get rid of him

294
00:27:53,529 --> 00:27:56,089
Please! Please leave!
This is a very personal meeting

295
00:27:56,532 --> 00:27:59,501
l know, your son with
Pratap's daughter

296
00:28:00,303 --> 00:28:01,793
Like a crow flying away
with a precious pearl

297
00:28:01,971 --> 00:28:05,930
He's calling Richa a crow, Sumi!
- Actually, he's calling Aditya a crow

298
00:28:06,576 --> 00:28:10,842
Correct! This girl's so educated
and your son's a drop-out from school!

299
00:28:11,547 --> 00:28:14,038
l'm going to thrash him, Sumi!
- Please... take him away from here

300
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:17,178
Pratap, l suggest you come with me!
He's not turning up

301
00:28:17,754 --> 00:28:20,518
Will you keep quiet? My Adi is
a stickler for punctuality! Okay?

302
00:28:20,823 --> 00:28:24,520
Oh yes, a great stickler!
He's always just five hours late!

303
00:28:24,827 --> 00:28:26,852
The drop-out monkey!

304
00:28:27,897 --> 00:28:30,127
My Adi's done his MBA.
With a first class!

305
00:28:30,566 --> 00:28:35,697
That's nothing! My father was a
TC (ticket collector) on the Rajdhani!

306
00:28:36,172 --> 00:28:39,198
l'm not talking about trains!
l'm talking about his degree!

307
00:28:39,575 --> 00:28:40,974
He has two degrees!

308
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:44,543
And my uncle was running up
a fever of 105 degrees!

309
00:28:45,648 --> 00:28:47,172
C'mon... come!

310
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:55,013
What's this guy...? Let's go
before he returns

311
00:28:55,591 --> 00:28:58,151
Natu will come back,
but where's Aditya...?

312
00:28:58,594 --> 00:29:00,152
We were supposed to meet at 8
and it's already 9 !

313
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:01,497
l'll phone him

314
00:29:01,864 --> 00:29:06,096
Go on, Adi.
Get married to Richa

315
00:29:07,837 --> 00:29:12,934
She's very nice.
She can even brew tea!

316
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:18,514
You will be happy with her.
- But l love you, Pooja

317
00:29:18,881 --> 00:29:20,849
So why didn't you tell your father?
- My father...

318
00:29:22,952 --> 00:29:24,920
You know what could happen
if l told my father

319
00:29:25,188 --> 00:29:27,520
Yes, l do. Which is why
l'm asking you to go away

320
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:34,189
Even the phone's ringing now!

321
00:29:38,901 --> 00:29:41,529
Adi...? Papa here

322
00:29:42,572 --> 00:29:44,199
Yes, yes...

323
00:29:46,642 --> 00:29:49,975
What...? Oh, l see, l see...

324
00:29:50,346 --> 00:29:52,211
He's helping some poor man out
and got held up

325
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:55,881
Actually, we're here at the club...

326
00:29:57,019 --> 00:29:59,044
Thakur...
- You can take your own time...

327
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:02,558
Your phone, Thakur...
your phone's ringing

328
00:30:03,926 --> 00:30:08,158
Well... a wrong number.
The instrument isn't working

329
00:30:08,631 --> 00:30:10,895
They're all bloody crooks.
- Really?

330
00:30:11,667 --> 00:30:14,101
Relax, Thakur. He must be
caught up with a problem

331
00:30:16,672 --> 00:30:18,572
l'm sorry, Pratap

332
00:30:25,615 --> 00:30:27,583
The humiliation l had to face
because of him...

333
00:30:28,017 --> 00:30:29,848
Yes, he even switched off his phone.
- What...?

334
00:30:30,019 --> 00:30:31,987
His phone...?
- Yes! He switched it off.

335
00:30:32,288 --> 00:30:34,222
There's a limit to irresponsibility.
- l tell you !

336
00:30:34,423 --> 00:30:37,256
There's a limit to carelessness!
- Let him come. l'll take him to task...

337
00:30:37,927 --> 00:30:39,895
Yes. Let him come

338
00:30:40,963 --> 00:30:44,262
l'll take him to task in a way...
- Will you take him to task or ask?

339
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,597
''Where've you been, Adi?
What happened, my son?''

340
00:30:46,802 --> 00:30:48,599
l will take him to task, Sumi!
Let him at least come home!

341
00:30:49,338 --> 00:30:51,533
lf l don't break his legs,
l won't call myself lshwar again !

342
00:30:52,008 --> 00:30:54,533
Dad...
- Adi...?

343
00:30:55,578 --> 00:30:59,070
My son ! What happened, son?
Where were you?

344
00:30:59,615 --> 00:31:03,551
Why the long face...?
Tell Daddy what's up, c'mon

345
00:31:03,819 --> 00:31:06,549
Laxman, will you a fetch
a book of names?

346
00:31:06,923 --> 00:31:09,687
We got to change the master's name.
- But l was about to scold him, Sumi...

347
00:31:11,594 --> 00:31:13,061
This book...?

348
00:31:13,596 --> 00:31:15,894
What have you brought the book for?
Go away!

349
00:31:16,198 --> 00:31:18,223
Go where?
- Go and get to work!

350
00:31:18,601 --> 00:31:23,561
Can't you see how upset he is?
Adi... no, my son ! Why're you crying?

351
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:26,238
Laxman ! Fetch some water.
- To drink...?

352
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:29,578
No, to bathe!
Get a bucket full of water!

353
00:31:30,046 --> 00:31:32,014
No, Adi.. don't cry

354
00:31:33,215 --> 00:31:35,581
Why must you cry...?
Sit down... take it easy

355
00:31:35,985 --> 00:31:39,045
No, not the cushion to wipe tears.
- Use daddy's shirt

356
00:31:39,622 --> 00:31:43,581
You mustn't be carrying a handkerchief?
- Can't you see how upset he is, Sumi?

357
00:31:43,993 --> 00:31:46,826
Oh yes. Well, what's up son?
What's biting you?

358
00:31:49,665 --> 00:31:51,189
Daddy, Mummy...

359
00:31:52,568 --> 00:31:55,537
this girl, a friend of mine,
ran away to get married

360
00:31:56,572 --> 00:32:00,133
And l helped her do it.
- ls that all...?

361
00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:04,137
Was that what you were crying for?
You're really funny, Adi!

362
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:09,210
But daddy, the boy
she married...

363
00:32:11,187 --> 00:32:15,214
the boy...

364
00:32:16,192 --> 00:32:17,557
is me

365
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:27,569
Kidding...? Kidding!

366
00:32:28,104 --> 00:32:30,231
Sumi, this son of yours...
you're kidding, aren't you?

367
00:32:31,407 --> 00:32:33,568
No
- Marriage...?

368
00:32:33,909 --> 00:32:37,367
Calm down... relax!
Let me talk to him!

369
00:32:38,047 --> 00:32:39,844
You're not kidding, right?
- No

370
00:32:40,049 --> 00:32:41,710
You know what you're saying?
Marriage!?

371
00:32:41,884 --> 00:32:43,784
Who on earth have you married?
- A girl

372
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:46,113
Good thing. Else daddy
would've had a heart attack

373
00:32:46,722 --> 00:32:48,952
What's her name?
- l fondly call her Mithi

374
00:32:49,325 --> 00:32:51,691
Fondly whatever! What's her name?
- Pooja

375
00:32:51,961 --> 00:32:53,189
Where does she live?
- ln my car

376
00:32:53,562 --> 00:32:56,531
ln your car...? Since when?
- l mean, she's in the car right now

377
00:32:56,899 --> 00:32:59,527
Go and bring her inside!
Go on !

378
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:02,738
As you say, daddy.
- As you say, daddy!

379
00:33:03,239 --> 00:33:05,207
Calm down...
- How can l calm down? Marriage...

380
00:33:05,574 --> 00:33:07,872
He gets married without
even telling us and...

381
00:33:08,844 --> 00:33:10,812
Sir, the water

382
00:33:12,181 --> 00:33:15,082
Take it away! Have a bath
on my behalf! Go on !

383
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:22,553
ln the kitchen or the bathroom?
- He bathes in the kitchen?

384
00:33:22,858 --> 00:33:25,554
Wherever he bathes, lshu...
will you please calm down?

385
00:33:25,928 --> 00:33:28,556
Whether we like it or not, we'll have to
welcome our daughter-in-law, isn't it?

386
00:33:29,265 --> 00:33:32,894
Has the young master got married?
- Gawd! What a nuisance!

387
00:33:33,302 --> 00:33:36,965
That boy decided to get married and
didn't even bother to ask us!

388
00:33:37,306 --> 00:33:39,137
And this chap keeps asking
all sorts of questions!

389
00:33:39,675 --> 00:33:43,008
Go.
Go away for now

390
00:33:44,914 --> 00:33:47,576
Me...?
- Yes

391
00:33:48,384 --> 00:33:50,352
Go inside now

392
00:34:02,565 --> 00:34:03,532
Bless you

393
00:34:23,586 --> 00:34:25,213
May you live long

394
00:34:25,588 --> 00:34:28,022
Dad...
- Okay, okay

395
00:34:29,258 --> 00:34:31,556
Do her folks know?
Or are they also...?

396
00:34:31,861 --> 00:34:35,888
Mithi's an amazing girl.
She told her folks that...

397
00:34:36,265 --> 00:34:38,699
she'd be staying at Rimi's house.
And Rimi, her friend...

398
00:34:39,001 --> 00:34:42,164
will break the news to her father
that we've got a bit married

399
00:34:42,638 --> 00:34:45,698
How much is a bit...?
A spoonful of marriage?

400
00:34:45,941 --> 00:34:47,067
lshu..
- What lshu !

401
00:34:47,243 --> 00:34:49,575
Her father can file a police
case against us, Adi!

402
00:34:49,912 --> 00:34:52,972
That he will.
- You mean, that's for sure...?

403
00:34:53,349 --> 00:34:56,716
Yes.
- ls your father an oddball...?

404
00:34:57,086 --> 00:34:59,850
No, he's not an oddball. lt's just
that he's a bit eccentric

405
00:35:00,156 --> 00:35:02,124
l see...
what's his business?

406
00:35:02,558 --> 00:35:04,992
He runs a factory of knives and daggers.
- Hear that?

407
00:35:05,561 --> 00:35:07,188
An eccentric man
who makes knives and daggers!

408
00:35:07,563 --> 00:35:10,191
That's why we didn't tell him.
- But l manufacture harmless toys!

409
00:35:10,566 --> 00:35:12,124
Why wasn't l told?

410
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:17,870
One moment... one moment!

411
00:35:19,675 --> 00:35:24,112
My dear, is your father eccentric?
- Yes

412
00:35:24,346 --> 00:35:27,110
He makes knives and daggers...?

413
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:29,551
Can you raise the veil, please?

414
00:35:30,386 --> 00:35:32,547
You're Natu's daughter, aren't you?

415
00:35:50,606 --> 00:35:53,507
Sumi! Call him over!

416
00:35:55,544 --> 00:36:00,106
Make a phone call to Natu-bhai
and just call him over!

417
00:36:07,556 --> 00:36:11,583
Well, Natu-bhai? Why're you hiding
your face like a nervous bride?

418
00:36:12,561 --> 00:36:15,621
Your daughter has married my son.
They ran away together!

419
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:21,199
Natu-bhai... say something, please.
- What can he say?

420
00:36:21,770 --> 00:36:24,534
My son's a crow that flew away
with a pearl...? Huh?

421
00:36:25,007 --> 00:36:26,736
Adi's a monkey who dropped out?

422
00:36:27,643 --> 00:36:31,977
That's nothing, Sumi! Natu-bhai is
now this monkey's father-in-law!

423
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:38,750
Your daughter Pooja ran away to
marry my son Adi!

424
00:36:39,321 --> 00:36:41,221
lshu... please!
- Right!

425
00:36:42,291 --> 00:36:45,886
Natu-bhai, we're now relatives.
Please say peace

426
00:36:46,095 --> 00:36:48,063
Could you folks embrace...?

427
00:36:49,031 --> 00:36:52,057
Well, if not embrace, you can
atleast sweeten your tongues...?

428
00:36:52,534 --> 00:36:56,834
What will you have Natu-bhai?
Coffee? Juice...? Cold-coffee?

429
00:36:57,139 --> 00:36:59,164
Bathroom.
- You'll have to go there on your own !

430
00:36:59,541 --> 00:37:01,133
We can't bring it down here.
Laxman...

431
00:37:06,348 --> 00:37:08,976
Oh yes, you haven't
met Laxman, have you?

432
00:37:11,553 --> 00:37:13,851
Laxman... come here

433
00:37:14,890 --> 00:37:18,519
Meet Natu-bhai. Pooja's father

434
00:37:23,332 --> 00:37:25,857
Hello.
- Hello

435
00:37:28,570 --> 00:37:30,868
Did your daughter run away
to get married?

436
00:37:33,575 --> 00:37:34,542
Yes

437
00:37:36,578 --> 00:37:40,810
Why did she run away?
- She was the running champ at college!

438
00:37:43,385 --> 00:37:45,216
Which college?
- JC College

439
00:37:46,622 --> 00:37:50,558
Like whom...?
- JC! J.C. College!

440
00:37:50,859 --> 00:37:52,827
l mean, like which college?

441
00:37:53,963 --> 00:37:57,660
Jaswant Chavan College! That's why
she ran away to get married!

442
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:00,825
Didn't she call you to the wedding?

443
00:38:02,538 --> 00:38:03,505
No

444
00:38:05,541 --> 00:38:09,978
Why didn't she invite you?
- She was running, you see...

445
00:38:10,546 --> 00:38:12,514
and l have a knee-pains

446
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:16,517
Did the marriage take place then?
- Obviously, it did...

447
00:38:16,952 --> 00:38:18,977
everybody was running. The bride,
the bridegroom...

448
00:38:19,555 --> 00:38:23,514
the priest ran with the holy fire,
they even took the vows on the run !

449
00:38:23,926 --> 00:38:29,831
And that guy who's laughing...
Pooja's husband... her lord and master!

450
00:38:31,633 --> 00:38:33,191
So who's her husband then?

451
00:38:33,602 --> 00:38:36,036
Who's this guy...?
A politician or a terrorist...?

452
00:38:36,572 --> 00:38:38,938
Didn't you want to go
to the bathroom...?

453
00:38:39,308 --> 00:38:41,208
Hey Laxman, show him to the bathroom

454
00:38:42,945 --> 00:38:44,913
What are you going to
the bathroom for?

455
00:38:45,647 --> 00:38:47,979
lt's for me to decide what l'm
going to do in the bathroom!

456
00:38:48,584 --> 00:38:50,814
No... l've already done the laundry

457
00:38:53,322 --> 00:38:56,052
Go on ! Enjoy yourself, Natu-bhai!
l have a wonderful bathroom!

458
00:38:56,525 --> 00:38:59,824
This is nothing! We have a 12-bedroom
hall and kitchen bungalow

459
00:39:00,229 --> 00:39:02,493
And the bathroom...? Do you go
to the neighbours for that?

460
00:39:03,665 --> 00:39:05,155
What do you mean by that, lshwar?

461
00:39:06,568 --> 00:39:09,833
Ashalata, Pooja... come on !
l've taken enough ! Let's go!

462
00:39:10,205 --> 00:39:15,108
Go where...? And how...? Pooja's now
my daughter-in-law, Natu-bhai!

463
00:39:15,844 --> 00:39:21,043
Your daughter ran away to
marry my son Aditya!

464
00:39:22,618 --> 00:39:25,052
Stop raving about ''running away''!

465
00:39:25,687 --> 00:39:29,987
This is nothing! My niece ran away
after the marriage. Twice at that!

466
00:39:30,559 --> 00:39:33,892
Please, lshwar... he's a
relative of ours now. Please?

467
00:39:37,566 --> 00:39:41,058
Okay, okay, Natu-bhai,
l'm really very sorry

468
00:39:41,603 --> 00:39:43,969
With folded hands...
l say sorry to you

469
00:39:44,573 --> 00:39:48,532
That's nothing! l fold my hands,
bow my head and apologise to you !

470
00:39:48,777 --> 00:39:51,974
l touch your feet and ask for
your forgiveness, Natu-bhai!

471
00:39:52,581 --> 00:39:55,982
l prostrate at your feet
and apologise to you !

472
00:39:56,685 --> 00:39:58,550
Your apology means nothing!

473
00:39:59,588 --> 00:40:02,056
Yes! Me accepts, Natu-bhai!

474
00:40:21,143 --> 00:40:23,577
''Let's dance''

475
00:40:43,332 --> 00:40:45,300
''You're just the one
l keep thinking about''

476
00:40:45,767 --> 00:40:47,735
''Yours is the charm
that appeals to my heart''

477
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:51,699
''l have loved you,
with all my heart and soul''

478
00:40:53,208 --> 00:40:56,871
''You win and l lose''

479
00:40:58,147 --> 00:41:00,877
''You're just the one
l keep thinking about''

480
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:03,150
''Yours is the charm
that appeals to my heart''

481
00:41:03,385 --> 00:41:07,014
''l have loved you,
with all my heart and soul''

482
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:12,253
''You win and l lose''

483
00:41:34,616 --> 00:41:38,052
''Your scarf...
has robbed me of my peace''

484
00:41:39,621 --> 00:41:43,580
''You are the only one
my eyes love to see''

485
00:41:49,898 --> 00:41:53,664
''The dot on your forehead
means the life to me...''

486
00:41:54,903 --> 00:41:58,930
''l hear bells ringing in my heart
for your love''

487
00:42:04,846 --> 00:42:09,146
''You are the one l love,
l dance in gay abandon''

488
00:42:09,918 --> 00:42:14,548
''To you l have given
my heart and soul, my love''

489
00:42:20,596 --> 00:42:22,962
''There's no one like you, love''

490
00:42:25,601 --> 00:42:27,899
''Hide me in your eyes forever''

491
00:42:30,806 --> 00:42:33,036
''You're just the one
l keep thinking about''

492
00:42:33,342 --> 00:42:35,242
''Yours is the charm
that appeals to my heart''

493
00:42:35,611 --> 00:42:39,570
''l have loved you,
with all my heart and soul''

494
00:42:40,849 --> 00:42:44,250
''You win and l lose''

495
00:43:06,575 --> 00:43:10,033
''Your bangles chime...
they reveal your secrets''

496
00:43:11,647 --> 00:43:16,209
''How your bangle torments me''

497
00:43:21,923 --> 00:43:25,791
''lt's your glitter
that beckons me...''

498
00:43:26,928 --> 00:43:31,228
''l could die for your charms''

499
00:43:37,205 --> 00:43:41,164
''My love, sweetheart,
l can't live without you''

500
00:43:42,210 --> 00:43:46,909
''Listen, sweetheart,
to you l've given everything''

501
00:43:52,554 --> 00:43:54,920
''l've got to tell you...''

502
00:43:57,893 --> 00:44:00,123
''we've got to live
together forever''

503
00:44:02,864 --> 00:44:05,094
''You're just the one
l keep thinking about''

504
00:44:05,567 --> 00:44:07,535
''Yours is the charm
that appeals to my heart''

505
00:44:07,903 --> 00:44:11,669
''l have loved you,
with all my heart and soul''

506
00:44:12,941 --> 00:44:16,775
''You win and l lose''

507
00:44:56,118 --> 00:44:59,918
Hello, son. Where are you?
- We're in Greece right now, dad

508
00:45:00,555 --> 00:45:02,785
By mistake the travel agent...
- lt's two months, son

509
00:45:03,125 --> 00:45:06,526
Just another week, dad!
We'll be back in a week

510
00:45:06,728 --> 00:45:11,188
This is such a lovely place...
- l don't like it without you, my son

511
00:45:12,567 --> 00:45:14,797
lf possible, could you...?

512
00:45:15,303 --> 00:45:17,863
Okay, dad. We'll leave
for Mumbai tomorrow

513
00:45:18,306 --> 00:45:20,672
l love you, dad. And this is
not much of a place either

514
00:45:21,276 --> 00:45:24,109
l love you, son.
- You take care. Okay, dad?

515
00:45:26,181 --> 00:45:29,309
l hope you won't mind?
- l just want to be with you

516
00:45:30,585 --> 00:45:32,553
Whether it's in Greece
or Ghatkopar!

517
00:45:33,989 --> 00:45:35,957
You were right, Sumi

518
00:45:40,595 --> 00:45:42,563
lt's time l told him the truth

519
00:45:45,267 --> 00:45:47,235
We don't have a choice, do we?

520
00:45:51,206 --> 00:45:54,175
But... how are we
going to tell him?

521
00:45:56,211 --> 00:45:58,008
Just as you told me about it

522
00:46:02,217 --> 00:46:03,514
lshu...?

523
00:46:10,659 --> 00:46:15,096
l went home, Adi told me
that you were here. so...

524
00:46:16,565 --> 00:46:18,533
What did they have to say?

525
00:46:22,938 --> 00:46:24,838
Sumi...
- l don't want to hear it

526
00:46:25,974 --> 00:46:28,534
Sumi, the reports...
- No! l don't believe it!

527
00:46:30,679 --> 00:46:32,544
You mustn't believe it either!

528
00:46:33,582 --> 00:46:36,779
There must be a mistake... they
could have made a mistake, isn't it?

529
00:46:37,953 --> 00:46:39,545
Lung cancer

530
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:46,191
The last stage

531
00:46:57,639 --> 00:47:00,506
l'll have a word with them.
These doctors have a way of...

532
00:47:01,209 --> 00:47:03,006
talking any nonsense...
- Sumi!

533
00:47:04,613 --> 00:47:06,012
Lung cancer

534
00:47:08,550 --> 00:47:10,518
Let's consult other doctors

535
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:13,850
There's a very big cancer
hospital in Germany...

536
00:47:14,122 --> 00:47:16,249
All the reports were sent to them.
You're the one who sent them, Sumi

537
00:47:18,593 --> 00:47:21,528
The doctors have just one thing
to say: 9 months

538
00:47:23,665 --> 00:47:25,530
Or a year, if there's a miracle

539
00:47:32,574 --> 00:47:37,534
This is no less, lshu.
You promised me...

540
00:47:38,914 --> 00:47:44,011
that we'd celebrate the 50th, the 60th
and the 70th wedding anniversary together

541
00:47:47,589 --> 00:47:49,557
You will celebrate it, Sumi

542
00:47:52,527 --> 00:47:54,495
After l'm gone...

543
00:47:55,597 --> 00:47:58,498
you won't forget to wear a flower-band
in your hair, will you?

544
00:48:03,972 --> 00:48:06,497
You will keep me alive even after
l'm dead, won't you Sumi?

545
00:48:07,542 --> 00:48:10,170
How will l even live, lshu...?

546
00:48:12,914 --> 00:48:14,882
He'll be shattered, Sumi

547
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:20,288
The two of us will
take care of him

548
00:48:22,357 --> 00:48:24,325
We've been together
through happy times...

549
00:48:25,327 --> 00:48:27,522
we'll live together
through sorrow, too

550
00:48:28,830 --> 00:48:32,197
Which flight are they arriving by?
- 714, via Delhi

551
00:48:32,601 --> 00:48:35,069
lt's 3 hours late.
- This is nothing

552
00:48:35,971 --> 00:48:37,939
My uncle was returning
after his marriage...

553
00:48:38,139 --> 00:48:40,107
the flight arrived so late,
he had two children on the way

554
00:48:40,609 --> 00:48:43,544
Not again, Natu-bhai...
Hey Laxman, Natu-bhai wants you over

555
00:48:49,851 --> 00:48:53,048
Are we here to receive
Aditya and Pooja?

556
00:48:54,022 --> 00:48:54,989
Yes

557
00:48:56,858 --> 00:49:01,488
Are they arriving on a plane?
- We're at the airport, aren't we?

558
00:49:02,530 --> 00:49:04,498
So they'll be arriving on a plane

559
00:49:05,533 --> 00:49:09,833
But we came here in a car.
- That's because we are locals, you see?

560
00:49:11,339 --> 00:49:13,705
lt's different with those
who come in from outside

561
00:49:16,544 --> 00:49:18,512
But l arrived in a train.

562
00:49:19,881 --> 00:49:23,009
At the airport?
- The railway station

563
00:49:23,952 --> 00:49:28,582
Trains don't arrive at airports.
Only planes land here

564
00:49:30,992 --> 00:49:32,960
ls this an airport?

565
00:49:35,230 --> 00:49:37,960
No, it's a rickshaw-stand.
They're arriving in a rickshaw!

566
00:49:40,635 --> 00:49:43,968
Rickshaw-stand...? So where
will they keep their luggage?

567
00:49:44,572 --> 00:49:48,975
On my head. Where else?

568
00:49:50,578 --> 00:49:52,546
So why're you standing here?
Rather sit in a rickshaw

569
00:49:52,747 --> 00:49:55,011
Not one head... l have ten heads!

570
00:49:58,586 --> 00:50:00,554
Are you a ten-headed demon?
- Yes, l'm a demon !

571
00:50:00,855 --> 00:50:03,153
And you're more devilish than l am!
Will someone deliver me from this moron?

572
00:50:03,591 --> 00:50:05,218
There's Adi, lshu

573
00:50:13,101 --> 00:50:15,899
We'll have to tell him
everything today. Okay?

574
00:50:24,045 --> 00:50:26,240
Pooja... daddy!
- Hi!

575
00:50:28,283 --> 00:50:29,580
Hey dad!

576
00:50:40,895 --> 00:50:43,159
Dad, dad... l've heard of a
quick engagement and marriage

577
00:50:43,665 --> 00:50:48,932
ln our case, there's no engagement,
it's straightaway a marriage and a kid!

578
00:50:54,042 --> 00:50:56,010
You've become a grandfather!

579
00:50:59,047 --> 00:51:01,015
Dad's become a grandfather!

580
00:51:07,589 --> 00:51:09,955
What about the grandpa's hug...?
C'mon !

581
00:51:20,602 --> 00:51:23,332
Aren't you happy?
- Happy? l...

582
00:51:23,905 --> 00:51:26,567
Sure...?
- l'm going mad with joy!

583
00:51:27,375 --> 00:51:30,776
Natu-bhai! Sister-in-law!
l'm going to become a grandfather!

584
00:51:31,112 --> 00:51:34,946
Sumi... a grandfather!
l... a grandfather!

585
00:51:36,151 --> 00:51:38,119
l've got full value for
the toy-factory l built

586
00:51:38,620 --> 00:51:40,178
We'll soon have someone
to play with the toys!

587
00:51:40,622 --> 00:51:42,180
Adi, Pooja... l love you !

588
00:51:42,390 --> 00:51:44,187
Laxman ! Fetch some sweets!

589
00:51:44,959 --> 00:51:47,928
Won't you ask who'll you feed the
sweets to and why? Question him!

590
00:51:48,296 --> 00:51:50,924
Well, l know that the master's
going to become a grandfather

591
00:51:51,299 --> 00:51:55,963
Adi's going to become a father!
- Really? l didn't know that

592
00:51:56,571 --> 00:51:58,869
Are you going to become a father?
- Yes, Laxman

593
00:51:59,073 --> 00:52:02,531
We're also going to become grandparents
and Pooja will become a mother

594
00:52:02,777 --> 00:52:04,540
You mean, six babies in all?

595
00:52:09,250 --> 00:52:13,550
Dad, if it's a baby-boy,
let's have everything in blue for him

596
00:52:14,022 --> 00:52:19,050
Blue clothes, blue shoes, blue pot,
blue tub, blue swing...

597
00:52:19,594 --> 00:52:23,325
And suppose it's a baby-girl,
let's have everything pink for her

598
00:52:23,932 --> 00:52:26,127
Wow! We never had such
fancy ideas in our time

599
00:52:26,401 --> 00:52:28,892
You mean all this will be wasted
if it's a baby-boy

600
00:52:29,404 --> 00:52:31,235
And all that will be wasted
if it's a baby-girl?

601
00:52:31,639 --> 00:52:37,942
What waste? We aren't misers like you
to have just one kid, Ma!

602
00:52:38,279 --> 00:52:40,247
We're going to have two children

603
00:52:41,282 --> 00:52:43,580
We're going to have two children.
What say?

604
00:52:44,085 --> 00:52:46,178
At least learn to take responsibility
for one child first, Adi

605
00:52:46,621 --> 00:52:49,590
So who's done all the shopping and
brought all that stuff? l have!

606
00:52:49,958 --> 00:52:52,518
l'm the one who put things together.
My wife keeps sleeping all day

607
00:52:52,927 --> 00:52:55,521
Tell her, Pooja.
- lt's the truth, Mom...

608
00:52:55,897 --> 00:52:57,660
Adi has changed for the better.
He has become very responsible

609
00:52:57,866 --> 00:53:02,030
Tell her about the jeans.
- We saw a pair of jeans worth 50,000

610
00:53:02,570 --> 00:53:06,529
He didn't even try it on !
- The money you spent on these things...

611
00:53:07,575 --> 00:53:10,043
belonged to your daddy, Adi.
You only squandered the money

612
00:53:10,245 --> 00:53:13,009
Stop it now, Sumi!
lsn't my money Adi's money too?

613
00:53:13,314 --> 00:53:15,077
No.
- What do you want, Mama?

614
00:53:15,850 --> 00:53:17,909
Create an identity of your own, Aditya.
Or else...

615
00:53:19,921 --> 00:53:21,889
Please tell him, lshwar

616
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:36,935
Aditya, l...
- Two months! ln just two months...

617
00:53:37,305 --> 00:53:39,239
You will prove that you can
become a very successful film-star

618
00:53:39,607 --> 00:53:40,972
Please, lshwar!
- l give you two months

619
00:53:41,142 --> 00:53:43,167
What?
- Please, Sumi!

620
00:53:43,711 --> 00:53:47,238
For the first time, he's trying to
come to terms with his responsibilities

621
00:53:49,050 --> 00:53:52,952
ln two months, you are going to
earn 100,000 from your acting, Aditya

622
00:53:53,254 --> 00:53:54,915
l don't care how you will do it,
that's your problem

623
00:53:55,089 --> 00:53:57,922
l can put that in writing.
- Put it in writing then

624
00:54:02,563 --> 00:54:06,522
Dictate the letter, dad.
- ln two months, by Holi...

625
00:54:06,834 --> 00:54:11,237
you will earn 100,000 rupees,
or you will join Archies thereafter

626
00:54:17,378 --> 00:54:18,936
Sign it, go on

627
00:54:24,585 --> 00:54:26,143
Signed, sealed and delivered

628
00:54:27,689 --> 00:54:30,556
Gentleman's word?
- ln writing, dad. ln writing!

629
00:54:31,592 --> 00:54:33,560
l could have told him then

630
00:54:35,663 --> 00:54:38,063
And maybe Adi would have started coming
to the factory from tomorrow

631
00:54:41,135 --> 00:54:47,096
But people would've asked him later,
''What happened of your acting career?''

632
00:54:48,943 --> 00:54:52,504
And he'd have had to say, ''l could've
become a very successful star...''

633
00:54:52,814 --> 00:54:58,514
''but l had to give it all up
because my father died suddenly''

634
00:55:02,557 --> 00:55:03,854
No, Sumi...

635
00:55:08,229 --> 00:55:14,065
l will not let my impending death
become an excuse for Adi's failure

636
00:55:16,571 --> 00:55:18,869
ln fact, whatever little time l have...

637
00:55:21,576 --> 00:55:23,874
l will try to make it the key
to his success

638
00:55:27,582 --> 00:55:29,880
The poor boy has asked
for only two months

639
00:55:30,585 --> 00:55:32,883
They'll go by even before
we realise it

640
00:55:34,022 --> 00:55:35,990
You will stand by me, won't you?

641
00:55:37,592 --> 00:55:40,925
Yes. Time will stand by us too

642
00:55:42,063 --> 00:55:45,260
Apart from Adi's success, you have
also to see your grandson

643
00:55:49,670 --> 00:55:53,106
Will l be able to see him, Sumi?
- Of course you will, lshu

644
00:56:06,554 --> 00:56:08,522
God ought to realise, Sumi

645
00:56:10,558 --> 00:56:13,527
l'm a man who has sold toys
to children all over the world...

646
00:56:14,829 --> 00:56:17,127
and now l'm going away without
even playing with my own grandchild

647
00:56:22,570 --> 00:56:27,098
l see a bridge between the
earth and the heavens, Sumi

648
00:56:30,244 --> 00:56:35,079
l see myself at one end of the bridge.
At the other end is my grandson

649
00:56:39,654 --> 00:56:43,215
He's arriving. And l'm leaving

650
00:56:48,029 --> 00:56:52,090
Our journey has already begun, Sumi.
But...

651
00:56:56,871 --> 00:56:58,998
whose journey will be
completed first...?

652
00:57:07,348 --> 00:57:10,511
''This festival of colours,
we'll dance together''

653
00:57:10,952 --> 00:57:14,012
''To the rhythm of the drums,
we shall dance together''

654
00:57:14,555 --> 00:57:17,683
''Spray the colours...''

655
00:57:17,892 --> 00:57:20,793
''lt brings good-fortune to all,
as we dance together''

656
00:58:46,714 --> 00:58:49,046
''Do me a favour,
let's play Holi''

657
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:53,646
''ln the colours
is the language of love''

658
00:59:07,868 --> 00:59:09,927
''Why do you keep following me?''

659
00:59:10,538 --> 00:59:12,506
''Why do you set my heart pounding?''

660
00:59:13,207 --> 00:59:15,107
''Go away, don't touch me''

661
00:59:15,543 --> 00:59:19,502
''Goodness! Here's Holi...''

662
00:59:19,947 --> 00:59:22,074
''Do me a favour, let's play Holi''

663
00:59:22,550 --> 00:59:24,711
''Goodness! Here's Holi''

664
00:59:25,286 --> 00:59:27,254
''ln the colours is love conveyed''

665
00:59:59,020 --> 01:00:00,954
''Red, blue and yellow...''

666
01:00:01,355 --> 01:00:03,220
''and your blushing cheeks''

667
01:00:03,758 --> 01:00:07,990
''O dark-eyed beauty,
you have an enticing gait''

668
01:00:13,267 --> 01:00:17,567
''Holi's just an excuse
to snuggle up to me''

669
01:00:18,005 --> 01:00:22,237
''My moon-like face you
want to smear with colours''

670
01:00:29,617 --> 01:00:33,986
''Holi will come and go,
but you have deceit at heart''

671
01:00:34,689 --> 01:00:36,919
''l'm not so naive
not to notice''

672
01:00:37,191 --> 01:00:41,594
''Goodness! Here's Holi''

673
01:00:42,063 --> 01:00:44,031
''Do me a favour,
let's play Holi''

674
01:00:44,365 --> 01:00:46,333
''Goodness! Here's Holi''

675
01:01:20,167 --> 01:01:24,570
''Ever since l have found you,
Holi's altogether different''

676
01:01:25,339 --> 01:01:29,241
''Your anklets chime to the
rhythm of my heart-beat''

677
01:01:35,015 --> 01:01:38,974
''You will use those sweet words
to steal my heart...''

678
01:01:39,687 --> 01:01:43,919
''l know, you always
do what you want to''

679
01:01:51,165 --> 01:01:55,534
''l concede defeat to you.
For l crave your love''

680
01:01:56,237 --> 01:02:02,972
''This Holi, l sway with you...
Goodness! Here's Holi''

681
01:02:03,577 --> 01:02:05,545
''Do me a favour, let's play Holi''

682
01:02:05,813 --> 01:02:07,974
''Goodness! Holi!''

683
01:02:08,582 --> 01:02:10,345
''The colours are all about love''

684
01:02:33,874 --> 01:02:36,570
''Do me a favour!
Let's play Holi''

685
01:02:40,648 --> 01:02:43,879
''For these colours
are all about love''

686
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:08,208
Happy Holi to you

687
01:03:13,314 --> 01:03:15,282
My last Holi

688
01:03:24,592 --> 01:03:25,559
Holi!

689
01:03:35,603 --> 01:03:37,093
Dad... Pooja!

690
01:03:41,342 --> 01:03:43,242
Move your leg.
- Sorry

691
01:03:46,614 --> 01:03:48,241
Don't argue,
Just drink it up

692
01:03:51,218 --> 01:03:53,914
l thought you were sensible, Pooja.
Even if you're Natu's daughter...

693
01:03:54,221 --> 01:03:56,018
l still thought you had some sense!

694
01:03:56,223 --> 01:03:58,783
But what has my father to do...?
- To hell with Natu !

695
01:03:59,827 --> 01:04:01,021
Never mind. Not hell.
To the oil fields with him!

696
01:04:01,195 --> 01:04:03,163
At the moment, he's away in
Australia on a vacation

697
01:04:03,564 --> 01:04:06,032
Wherever! There's something
called good sense, isn't there?

698
01:04:06,567 --> 01:04:08,865
And you... what happened
of your promise?

699
01:04:09,570 --> 01:04:11,868
You were going to earn 100,000 in
2 months. So where's the money?

700
01:04:12,139 --> 01:04:14,198
l knew you'd ask me this question.
So l've come prepared. Look at this

701
01:04:14,708 --> 01:04:17,871
The Zoom TV guys have started the
Zoom ln and Zoom Out talent contest

702
01:04:18,279 --> 01:04:20,247
The winners will get
the lucky break

703
01:04:20,648 --> 01:04:25,051
The first three will be signed by
top producers in leading roles

704
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:27,820
lt's a matter of only 5 months

705
01:04:28,022 --> 01:04:30,547
The contest's going to take 5 months.
l can't wait so long

706
01:04:30,958 --> 01:04:33,552
Dad, dad... it's a matter
just five months

707
01:04:33,928 --> 01:04:36,556
They'll go by in a jiffy.
- Adi, my son...

708
01:04:37,331 --> 01:04:40,562
put yourself in my shoes and think
of my situation sometimes!

709
01:04:40,768 --> 01:04:44,568
Have you ever tried to put yourself in
my shoes to consider my situation, dad?

710
01:04:44,905 --> 01:04:47,066
Adi...
- Please! Please!

711
01:04:57,051 --> 01:04:58,518
Go ahead.
- What?

712
01:04:59,353 --> 01:05:00,911
Do as he says

713
01:05:02,089 --> 01:05:04,523
Let him step into your shoes
for once and see...

714
01:05:04,825 --> 01:05:06,258
how difficult it is
to be a father

715
01:05:06,627 --> 01:05:11,621
l don't quite understand, Sumi...
- l know what Mom's getting at!

716
01:05:11,999 --> 01:05:15,662
For a little while, Mom wants me to put
forth my argument as lshwarchand...

717
01:05:16,003 --> 01:05:18,096
and you will play Aditya.
Right, Mom?

718
01:05:18,606 --> 01:05:21,131
So l'm your son, you're the father?
- Perfect!

719
01:05:21,575 --> 01:05:24,942
But you will accept whatever
decision is taken now, Aditya

720
01:05:25,579 --> 01:05:29,777
Left, right, left, right...
always ready for a fight!

721
01:05:30,985 --> 01:05:34,944
What are you waiting for...?
Go on. Get started

722
01:05:55,609 --> 01:05:57,770
Adi... Adi...
- She's calling you

723
01:05:57,978 --> 01:06:00,947
l'm calling you, dad.
You're Adi right now, remember?

724
01:06:02,883 --> 01:06:06,649
All the best! You're going to win.
Because you are the best, right?

725
01:06:08,222 --> 01:06:11,521
ls she talking to me, or you?
- Forget who she is talking to!

726
01:06:11,892 --> 01:06:16,056
You promised me two months ago that
you'd earn 100,000 rupees from acting...

727
01:06:16,563 --> 01:06:20,124
and give it to me. Where is the money?
- Dad...

728
01:06:20,567 --> 01:06:22,933
actually my ideas about
an acting career were a bit crazy

729
01:06:23,237 --> 01:06:25,705
So l have decided that
beginning tomorrow, l will...

730
01:06:25,939 --> 01:06:29,136
You will straightaway plunge into
the Zoom ln Zoom Out contest! Right?

731
01:06:29,576 --> 01:06:32,977
No, dad, no...
- Now don't con your father!

732
01:06:33,380 --> 01:06:35,541
Sumi, look at the twinkle
in your son's eyes!

733
01:06:35,916 --> 01:06:38,885
He dreams of becoming a star.
Go on, son. Become a film-star!

734
01:06:39,253 --> 01:06:41,084
Are you happy now...?
- That wasn't what l was getting at, dad!

735
01:06:41,288 --> 01:06:44,985
You haven't heard me out, dad...
- Silence! No arguments!

736
01:06:45,592 --> 01:06:47,992
Maybe l'm a bit stubborn
and sentimental

737
01:06:48,595 --> 01:06:50,563
But l'm not stone-hearted, my son

738
01:06:50,864 --> 01:06:54,493
Sumi, there are times when
l'm very angry with myself

739
01:06:55,335 --> 01:06:57,496
What have l given my son...?
- So much !

740
01:06:57,705 --> 01:07:00,105
What's so much? A BMW, money
and a house. That's it?

741
01:07:00,541 --> 01:07:02,099
That's it...?
- What else!

742
01:07:02,543 --> 01:07:05,011
A good father will
give his son freedom

743
01:07:05,212 --> 01:07:06,679
Go on, son...
- Where?

744
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:10,976
Go and fulfill your dreams, my son.
You have my blessings. Go!

745
01:07:11,351 --> 01:07:15,014
But didn't l promise to earn 100,000
and give it to you, dad?

746
01:07:15,556 --> 01:07:18,957
Or l'd join Archies, remember?
lt was in writing... here it is

747
01:07:28,235 --> 01:07:30,965
There you are. Happy now?
Now tell me something, my son

748
01:07:32,573 --> 01:07:35,872
How many years do you need to
make your dream come true?

749
01:07:36,176 --> 01:07:39,202
3 years? 5? 10 years...?
- What...?!

750
01:07:40,647 --> 01:07:42,979
Sumi, Pooja dear, l,
lshwarchand Thakur...

751
01:07:43,584 --> 01:07:48,715
give my son 10 years of freedom
to make his dreams come true

752
01:07:49,089 --> 01:07:53,082
And that is my final verdict. Thank
you very much, ladies and gentlemen !

753
01:07:56,864 --> 01:07:59,492
There you are!
He's stolen the thunder from you !

754
01:07:59,900 --> 01:08:02,164
Say something, my son !
- What will l say?

755
01:08:02,703 --> 01:08:05,069
This dad won't let me take a breath,
where will l speak from?

756
01:08:05,973 --> 01:08:09,932
Dad, daddy...
- No, no need to say thank you

757
01:08:10,310 --> 01:08:12,175
lf you must say thank you,
say it to God...

758
01:08:12,546 --> 01:08:15,947
who made my eyes open to reason !
l'm an elephant...

759
01:08:16,550 --> 01:08:18,518
who chews with teeth
he does not show

760
01:08:19,186 --> 01:08:21,518
My son, l still remember

761
01:08:22,556 --> 01:08:25,787
l left my father's house and
came to Bombay with just 35 rupees

762
01:08:26,126 --> 01:08:27,855
To live life on my own terms!

763
01:08:29,997 --> 01:08:32,966
How can l stop my son from doing
the same thing today?

764
01:08:33,567 --> 01:08:36,536
Just as l made my future bright
with my hard work and sincerity...

765
01:08:36,904 --> 01:08:40,203
you must also create an identity
and carve a niche of your own !

766
01:08:40,908 --> 01:08:42,739
Go on, my son. Go ahead!

767
01:08:44,912 --> 01:08:46,209
All right

768
01:08:47,581 --> 01:08:50,812
Those last words of yours were
like divine intervention, daddy!

769
01:08:51,185 --> 01:08:52,880
They contained so much of truth !

770
01:08:53,587 --> 01:08:56,488
What are you trying to say, son?
- All l'm saying, dad...

771
01:08:56,690 --> 01:08:59,989
just as you left your father's house
with just 35 rupees...

772
01:09:00,527 --> 01:09:03,963
l, Aditya lshwarchand Thakur will
leave this house and go away

773
01:09:04,531 --> 01:09:08,490
Now look, son... look...
- No! No... please, dad!

774
01:09:08,869 --> 01:09:10,837
Please don't stop me now.
Because l will not stay here!

775
01:09:11,071 --> 01:09:13,835
l'm useless and spoilt,
but l have a lot of self-respect!

776
01:09:14,208 --> 01:09:17,006
Mom! There are times l'm
so angry with myself!

777
01:09:17,544 --> 01:09:20,513
What have l ever done to make
my daddy feel proud of me?

778
01:09:20,747 --> 01:09:24,513
So much...
- l haven't done! But l will. Now!

779
01:09:24,885 --> 01:09:27,649
Mithi, Ma, and Laxman...
wherever you are!

780
01:09:28,255 --> 01:09:30,519
From today... this moment,
l'm leaving this house

781
01:09:30,791 --> 01:09:32,691
From today, my air-conditioned room
will be Laxman's...

782
01:09:32,926 --> 01:09:34,985
and that dilapidated outhouse
will be mine!

783
01:09:35,562 --> 01:09:39,020
And until l achieve something in life,
l'm not coming back to this house

784
01:09:39,566 --> 01:09:42,967
So give me your blessings, dad!
- Give him your blessings, lshu

785
01:09:43,937 --> 01:09:46,531
You're his father, aren't you?
Bless him for a long life

786
01:09:47,908 --> 01:09:49,136
May you live long

787
01:09:59,386 --> 01:10:04,551
Nice... good game!
We must play it more often !

788
01:10:05,325 --> 01:10:08,556
All right, dad. We're tired.
Pooja and l are going to bed

789
01:10:09,029 --> 01:10:11,554
Good night, dad.
Nice game...

790
01:10:12,933 --> 01:10:13,900
Stay

791
01:10:14,668 --> 01:10:19,037
So l'm an elephant who chews
with teeth you can't see?

792
01:10:19,673 --> 01:10:22,574
l'll now show you how l bite.
Get out

793
01:10:25,712 --> 01:10:28,579
Sorry, Pooja. You can stay here if
you wish to. But he'll have to leave

794
01:10:29,716 --> 01:10:33,243
l'll go with Adi. lt'll be a test
not just for him, but for me too

795
01:10:33,820 --> 01:10:36,914
All right. Move it, Adi...
Go on

796
01:10:37,691 --> 01:10:40,125
Treat every word l just said
as irrevocable

797
01:10:40,694 --> 01:10:43,925
Until you achieve something in life,
you will not step in this house

798
01:10:44,965 --> 01:10:47,263
Now get out and stay out.
Out!

799
01:10:49,069 --> 01:10:50,263
Go away!

800
01:10:50,637 --> 01:10:53,435
Do me a favour,
let's play holi...

801
01:10:53,707 --> 01:10:57,438
The door in the bathroom won't shut!
- That's very good news, baby...

802
01:10:57,711 --> 01:10:59,679
Shut up! l'm going
to give you a whack!

803
01:11:01,014 --> 01:11:02,982
Are you taking all this seriously?
- What else!

804
01:11:03,149 --> 01:11:06,778
lt's all a joke. Daddy will arrive in
a little while and say, ''Let's go home''

805
01:11:07,487 --> 01:11:09,148
But l'm stubborn,
l'm not budging

806
01:11:09,489 --> 01:11:12,458
l'll say, ''No, pay a penalty first.
Send us on another honeymoon''

807
01:11:12,959 --> 01:11:15,951
What do you think?
- You've gone mad! You know that?

808
01:11:17,197 --> 01:11:19,791
You're the one who'll go mad.
Have you heard of Morocco?

809
01:11:20,967 --> 01:11:22,935
Morocco! Not Monaco

810
01:11:24,037 --> 01:11:27,973
Just imagine... you and l.
ln Morocco

811
01:12:08,214 --> 01:12:13,447
''There'll be dawn,
there will be dusk...''

812
01:12:14,120 --> 01:12:20,457
''days will pass by...''

813
01:12:22,562 --> 01:12:26,965
''but l'll forever live and die
for your love''

814
01:12:42,115 --> 01:12:47,143
''There'll be dawn,
there will be dusk...''

815
01:12:47,754 --> 01:12:53,420
''days will pass by...''

816
01:12:54,127 --> 01:13:00,760
''but l'll forever live and die
for your love''

817
01:13:31,498 --> 01:13:35,958
''Ever since l've fallen
in love with you...''

818
01:13:37,637 --> 01:13:41,596
''life has been beautiful''

819
01:13:43,009 --> 01:13:47,605
''Buds have blossomed
even in autumn...''

820
01:13:48,681 --> 01:13:52,913
''in you, l have
found every happiness''

821
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:58,914
''My eyes have dreams,
dreams of you''

822
01:13:59,225 --> 01:14:04,094
''l'm in your arms,
in sheer ecstasy''

823
01:14:06,566 --> 01:14:11,435
''l shall blossom, no doubt''

824
01:14:14,941 --> 01:14:19,435
''For your love,
l shall live and die''

825
01:14:20,280 --> 01:14:24,944
''For your love,
l shall live and die''

826
01:14:28,822 --> 01:14:31,450
''There'll be dawn...''

827
01:14:34,627 --> 01:14:36,595
''there will be dusk...''

828
01:14:40,166 --> 01:14:42,464
''days will pass by...''

829
01:14:48,675 --> 01:14:53,408
''but l'll forever live and die
for your love''

830
01:14:54,180 --> 01:14:58,583
''l shall live and die
for your love''

831
01:15:20,173 --> 01:15:23,438
Aditya... wake up and
smell the coffee. Okay?

832
01:15:36,055 --> 01:15:37,955
l'm down by the boat, man !

833
01:15:42,162 --> 01:15:43,459
Hello!
- Who?

834
01:15:43,630 --> 01:15:45,257
Question-paper...?
This is Natu here

835
01:15:45,698 --> 01:15:47,461
From that side of the phone?

836
01:15:48,034 --> 01:15:49,934
Stop it now.
Give it to your boss

837
01:15:50,603 --> 01:15:51,763
What...? The phone?

838
01:15:51,938 --> 01:15:53,906
No, cut your hands
and give them to him

839
01:15:54,674 --> 01:15:57,404
The left? Or the right?
- Both of them, you demon !

840
01:16:02,949 --> 01:16:05,417
lf l cut both my hands,
how'll l hold the phone...?

841
01:16:05,985 --> 01:16:08,419
Place the phone on your head.
Cut your hands and give them to him

842
01:16:15,995 --> 01:16:18,429
lf l cut my left hand
with my right hand...

843
01:16:18,965 --> 01:16:23,095
what'll l cut my right hand with?
- Forget it! Never mind!

844
01:16:23,469 --> 01:16:24,993
Let's begin at the beginning!

845
01:16:25,171 --> 01:16:27,935
Give the phone to your boss.
That's it!

846
01:16:29,042 --> 01:16:32,443
But your phone is in your hands.
How can l give it to him?

847
01:16:32,979 --> 01:16:36,176
Give the phone you've got!
Why're you battering my brains...?

848
01:16:36,549 --> 01:16:39,950
Ricky's conned me too!
Such a big surfing board...

849
01:16:41,487 --> 01:16:43,455
Whose phone is it?

850
01:16:44,591 --> 01:16:46,559
Give it to me.
- To you?

851
01:16:48,494 --> 01:16:51,122
Hello
- Send this guy to the war!

852
01:16:51,531 --> 01:16:53,499
He's more dangerous than dynamite!

853
01:16:53,733 --> 01:16:55,394
What did you say to him?

854
01:16:56,703 --> 01:16:58,603
On the phone?
- Go on

855
01:16:58,771 --> 01:17:00,398
Hello
- Where must l go?

856
01:17:00,573 --> 01:17:02,404
The Andamans and Nicobar lslands

857
01:17:04,510 --> 01:17:07,411
Hello! Sister-in-law!
Are you there?

858
01:17:08,948 --> 01:17:11,416
Natu-bhai, we have a
bit of a problem here

859
01:17:11,584 --> 01:17:13,415
l know, l was talking
to it moments ago

860
01:17:13,620 --> 01:17:17,647
No, it's not about Laxman...
when are you returning?

861
01:17:17,924 --> 01:17:20,415
lf the embassy could help it,
they'd send me packing tomorrow

862
01:17:21,628 --> 01:17:24,597
But it might take another month.
But what is the problem?

863
01:17:25,999 --> 01:17:29,935
We've driven Aditya out of the house.
With Pooja

864
01:17:41,948 --> 01:17:47,113
Hey Laxman... why has the fan stopped?
- Has it stopped?

865
01:17:49,656 --> 01:17:52,887
Why has the fan stopped?
- That's what l'm asking...

866
01:17:53,092 --> 01:17:55,390
why has the fan stopped?
- Whom are you asking?

867
01:17:56,929 --> 01:18:00,888
l'm asking you, Laxman ! You !
- l see.. it's me. But what?

868
01:18:07,140 --> 01:18:09,700
Why has the fan stopped working?

869
01:18:09,909 --> 01:18:12,400
Because the lights are off.
- Do we have light here?

870
01:18:12,712 --> 01:18:14,680
Often. But this time
there's no power failure

871
01:18:17,116 --> 01:18:18,583
l've switched it off

872
01:18:18,751 --> 01:18:22,414
Hi, dad... c'mon !
''We're emperors...''

873
01:18:24,691 --> 01:18:26,591
Didn't l tell you dad would come?
- Laxman...

874
01:18:27,627 --> 01:18:30,425
have you brought the broom?
- This one...?

875
01:18:31,130 --> 01:18:36,432
Yes, Laxman. Give that broom to me.
Now, this moment... in these hands

876
01:18:39,005 --> 01:18:40,905
And go on now.
- Where to?

877
01:18:41,140 --> 01:18:44,439
Take this fuse. And hide it
someplace no one can find it

878
01:18:44,711 --> 01:18:46,679
Go on.
- May l hide it behind the fridge?

879
01:18:47,013 --> 01:18:50,449
Give that to me. Take your stuff,
switch on the AC in Adi's room...

880
01:18:50,583 --> 01:18:52,551
and go to sleep. Hurry!
- Now...?

881
01:18:54,087 --> 01:18:56,055
You aren't doing this to
irritate me, are you?

882
01:18:56,689 --> 01:18:58,919
You're the one who's doing things
to irritate us dad, not him

883
01:18:59,125 --> 01:19:01,389
Now please call us home.
We're fed up here

884
01:19:01,728 --> 01:19:03,889
The rent of this room
is 1500 rupees

885
01:19:04,564 --> 01:19:08,398
lf you want electricity, you'll have
to pay an advance of 5000 rupees. Cash

886
01:19:09,102 --> 01:19:12,071
You opened an account for me
which you've already closed

887
01:19:12,605 --> 01:19:15,073
And you gave me a credit-card
which can't be used anymore

888
01:19:15,975 --> 01:19:19,741
Here you are then. Clean the house,
wash the cars, work in the garden...

889
01:19:20,113 --> 01:19:23,571
and you can live here in return.
Fair enough...? Here you are

890
01:19:26,452 --> 01:19:27,441
What if l refuse to do it?

891
01:19:27,620 --> 01:19:30,748
This happens to be my property.
You'll have to vacate it, my son

892
01:19:32,458 --> 01:19:34,756
Whom are you trying to scare?
l have a lot of friends

893
01:19:34,994 --> 01:19:37,428
We'll go and live somewhere. Right?
- No

894
01:19:37,930 --> 01:19:40,763
You've done all you could, Aditya.
l know you very well

895
01:19:41,934 --> 01:19:44,903
This is where you'll have to stay.
You don't have a choice

896
01:19:46,973 --> 01:19:52,036
So the rent of this room is 1500
and the advance is Rs.5000

897
01:19:54,147 --> 01:19:58,880
Until you pay me that sum, you won't
even be able to breathe freely...

898
01:19:59,085 --> 01:20:01,519
let alone having any food.
Okay, my son...?

899
01:20:03,423 --> 01:20:05,391
See you...soon

900
01:20:09,962 --> 01:20:11,088
l'm not coming!

901
01:20:11,431 --> 01:20:15,060
l'm not going to ruin my life,
trying to sell your toys!

902
01:20:16,135 --> 01:20:18,103
You saw how he talked to me?

903
01:20:19,439 --> 01:20:22,408
ls this how a father
treats his son, Mithi?

904
01:20:22,575 --> 01:20:25,908
Exactly! That's what our son will ask.
How can a father treat his son like this?

905
01:20:27,747 --> 01:20:30,147
You've started neglecting him
even before he's born, Adi

906
01:20:30,616 --> 01:20:32,413
What neglect, darling...?
- What else is this!

907
01:20:32,618 --> 01:20:35,416
l haven't even had a cup of tea and
you're rubbing cream into your face

908
01:20:35,822 --> 01:20:37,915
But l have to.
The contest begins soon

909
01:20:38,491 --> 01:20:41,426
Apart from my talent, l also have
to take care of my looks

910
01:20:41,694 --> 01:20:44,094
There are 5 months to go for your
contest. What'll l do till then?

911
01:20:44,464 --> 01:20:45,624
You want me to act for a meal?

912
01:20:47,700 --> 01:20:50,760
Pooja hasn't had anything to eat.
- She's the one l'm taking this for

913
01:20:51,137 --> 01:20:54,436
Made in clarified-butter.
l'll ask her to eat it up quietly

914
01:20:55,708 --> 01:20:57,437
And Adi...?

915
01:20:59,879 --> 01:21:02,609
l mean, he must've come
to his senses by now

916
01:21:17,830 --> 01:21:21,459
l'm sorry, baby. l ought to
have considered your state

917
01:21:23,669 --> 01:21:25,637
After you, you are
my responsibility

918
01:21:27,507 --> 01:21:31,967
l have a suggestion. Go away to
your Papa's house for a few days,okay

919
01:21:34,680 --> 01:21:36,648
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

920
01:21:36,849 --> 01:21:38,976
lf you can't handle responsibilities,
why did you marry me, Adi?

921
01:21:39,252 --> 01:21:41,982
Because l love you, darling!
- No, you don't! You only love yourself!

922
01:21:43,122 --> 01:21:45,488
Or you wouldn't have been so shameless
to ask me to go to my father's house

923
01:21:45,758 --> 01:21:47,988
What else can l do...?
l'm worried about you

924
01:21:48,227 --> 01:21:52,425
Get to work. Understand your
responsibilities... live up to them!

925
01:21:53,699 --> 01:21:55,929
Now who's going to make a lead man
out of me in one single day?

926
01:21:57,036 --> 01:22:00,437
Or do you want me to sweep the
garden...? Me? Sweep the garden?

927
01:22:01,807 --> 01:22:05,766
Where are you going now...?
To Papa's house...? Hey!

928
01:22:06,779 --> 01:22:09,111
Taking a walk, are you...?
What are you upto?

929
01:22:09,549 --> 01:22:11,517
You think you are a prince

930
01:22:11,851 --> 01:22:14,581
And despite being a princess,
l'll have to work for a living

931
01:22:16,989 --> 01:22:18,786
My baby's starving

932
01:22:19,659 --> 01:22:22,787
Listen to me... Listen ! Please!

933
01:22:24,063 --> 01:22:26,793
Don't cry. l feel awful
when you cry, please

934
01:22:27,233 --> 01:22:29,793
And give that broom to me.
lt doesn't look good in your hands

935
01:22:30,636 --> 01:22:33,469
Look at me...
you do trust me, don't you?

936
01:22:33,639 --> 01:22:36,802
l don't right now.
- Well, all right. You will soon

937
01:22:37,176 --> 01:22:41,476
ln a little while, l'll get fruits,
pizzas and... everything for you !

938
01:22:41,681 --> 01:22:43,649
l'll bring for you everything
in the world, okay?

939
01:22:43,849 --> 01:22:45,646
So go inside and rest

940
01:22:47,687 --> 01:22:50,485
lf not for us, do it at least
for the baby that's going to arrive

941
01:22:50,890 --> 01:22:53,415
Please, please, please...

942
01:23:05,271 --> 01:23:09,765
Ma... what's for breakfast?
- Nothing for you

943
01:23:10,142 --> 01:23:14,101
l stay out for a day and you get back
to making rotten things!

944
01:23:14,814 --> 01:23:17,783
l'm so hungry, l'm going to faint.
Rustle up a meal for me, please!

945
01:23:18,017 --> 01:23:19,985
Aditya, you've got an
opportunity to prove...

946
01:23:20,152 --> 01:23:21,847
that you can look after
your wife and child

947
01:23:22,021 --> 01:23:24,956
Don't lose this opportunity.
- You too have the opportunity...

948
01:23:25,157 --> 01:23:27,057
to feed your pregnant daughter-in-law.
What are you doing about it?

949
01:23:27,226 --> 01:23:30,957
You keep scolding me for nothing!
Please, Ma... l'm terribly hungry

950
01:23:32,665 --> 01:23:35,463
All right, you don't make it.
l'll ask Question-Mark to do it

951
01:23:35,735 --> 01:23:36,702
Laxman...

952
01:23:59,458 --> 01:24:01,426
Hurry up and pack it in

953
01:24:05,131 --> 01:24:06,598
You sit here

954
01:24:27,553 --> 01:24:30,613
Aditya's in the kitchen.
Stuffing the lunch-box

955
01:24:33,492 --> 01:24:35,460
Adi, keep that lunch-box back

956
01:24:35,628 --> 01:24:37,596
Sumi, this boy is not
stepping in this house again

957
01:24:38,698 --> 01:24:41,963
Keep it back.
- Not for me. For your daughter-in-law

958
01:24:42,168 --> 01:24:44,466
She's hungry. lt's necessary
for her to eat, isn't it?

959
01:24:44,737 --> 01:24:46,967
So have the food brought from her
father's house! ls this a hotel?

960
01:24:48,741 --> 01:24:51,642
Why're you talking like this, Dad?
Mithi's pregnant, isn't she?

961
01:24:51,811 --> 01:24:53,779
Did you ask us before
you planned the baby?

962
01:24:54,880 --> 01:24:57,906
10 babies are born every minute
in this country

963
01:24:58,718 --> 01:25:00,652
Must l turn my house into
an orphanage...

964
01:25:00,953 --> 01:25:03,581
so every hungry beggar can
barge into it whenever he's hungry?

965
01:25:03,789 --> 01:25:05,154
My child is not an orphan, dad

966
01:25:05,524 --> 01:25:07,890
With a father like you,
what else will your child be?

967
01:25:09,261 --> 01:25:10,751
The child will himself
ask you some day...

968
01:25:10,930 --> 01:25:13,421
''Why did you give birth to me,
if you couldn't look after me?''

969
01:25:17,136 --> 01:25:21,436
Even an animal takes the trouble to
hunt for her cubs, you shameless man !

970
01:25:21,941 --> 01:25:23,909
You're worse than an animal!
The beggar!

971
01:25:25,111 --> 01:25:26,942
Go on now! Get lost!

972
01:25:28,614 --> 01:25:31,447
lf you're so fond of begging,
stand with your wife on the streets

973
01:25:31,717 --> 01:25:33,685
A lot of people will take
pity on you and give you money

974
01:25:33,953 --> 01:25:37,116
And when the baby's born, take it
along too. You'll get a lot of money!

975
01:25:40,826 --> 01:25:42,123
C'mon get out!

976
01:25:45,164 --> 01:25:46,131
Out!

977
01:25:58,978 --> 01:26:01,742
lt's all happening because of you,
Sumi. Only because of you !

978
01:26:03,949 --> 01:26:08,750
l'm his mother, lshu...
do you think l didn't feel bad?

979
01:26:10,156 --> 01:26:12,420
Was that any way for me to
talk to my son?

980
01:26:17,663 --> 01:26:19,426
l've broken my son's heart

981
01:26:23,936 --> 01:26:26,928
After l'm dead, you must tell him
that all this was because...

982
01:26:31,644 --> 01:26:35,603
My darling son !
How hurt he must've been

983
01:26:39,018 --> 01:26:40,781
But l liked it very much

984
01:26:42,621 --> 01:26:44,589
We're teaching him to
walk on his own, lshu

985
01:26:45,491 --> 01:26:50,861
Let him fall and steady himself.
He'll learn to walk on his own

986
01:26:54,900 --> 01:26:59,894
Whatever you're doing is right.
You mustn't regret it

987
01:27:42,948 --> 01:27:44,916
Go away, Pooja.
Go back to the room

988
01:27:46,018 --> 01:27:48,452
No, Aditya. Let me stand here

989
01:27:49,722 --> 01:27:54,887
l want our baby to see what a
responsible man his father is

990
01:27:56,762 --> 01:27:58,730
He can even pick up the broom...
- l'm a terrible man

991
01:27:59,965 --> 01:28:01,933
Why else would Papa say
such nasty things to me?

992
01:28:02,935 --> 01:28:06,894
What a scolding he gave me!
- You're a very responsible father

993
01:28:09,008 --> 01:28:10,976
But you are a terrible servant

994
01:28:12,945 --> 01:28:16,745
That's not the way to sweep
the floor, Adi. Let me do it

995
01:28:16,949 --> 01:28:19,076
No, l'll learn it.
l can't sweep the garden too

996
01:28:19,451 --> 01:28:22,909
Didn't l ask you to go away?
Go on... go away from here

997
01:28:41,907 --> 01:28:44,569
Where are you going, Adi?
- Our baby's starving, Pooja

998
01:28:45,210 --> 01:28:47,178
We need to do something.
l'll be back soon

999
01:28:49,148 --> 01:28:51,116
l'll do it right away, sir

1000
01:28:53,752 --> 01:28:55,379
Sharma, this is Chowdhary

1001
01:28:58,757 --> 01:29:01,385
Listen to me. He's irresponsible

1002
01:29:01,994 --> 01:29:03,894
Keeping me on tenterhooks
till the last moment. Why?

1003
01:29:04,596 --> 01:29:08,396
No, you listen to me! l'll complain
to the stuntmen's union, you dig?

1004
01:29:08,701 --> 01:29:11,534
Sir, if you need an assistant...

1005
01:29:11,770 --> 01:29:14,398
l need poison right now.
Will you fetch some?

1006
01:29:14,673 --> 01:29:16,971
lf the shoot is cancelled, the producer
and the director will kill me

1007
01:29:17,176 --> 01:29:19,406
Give me one chance, sir.
l badly need money

1008
01:29:19,678 --> 01:29:21,646
l'm talking on the phone,
let me talk

1009
01:29:21,947 --> 01:29:24,916
Now listen to me, Sharma.
l understand it's a difficult stunt

1010
01:29:25,117 --> 01:29:28,917
But l can't help it. Who will reason
with the producer and the director?

1011
01:29:29,088 --> 01:29:30,578
Can you?

1012
01:29:31,790 --> 01:29:34,759
Right, that's why l ask you to talk
to some stuntman and send him over

1013
01:29:35,961 --> 01:29:39,419
All right, charge double the amount.
You don't want me killed, do you?

1014
01:29:39,631 --> 01:29:41,758
l'll do it, sir...
- Shut up, will you?

1015
01:29:43,002 --> 01:29:47,439
l know it's risky, but there's risk
involved in every business

1016
01:29:48,807 --> 01:29:52,038
Flood, earthquake, extortion threats
... anything can happen

1017
01:29:54,646 --> 01:29:59,379
So you won't send a stuntman?
To hell with all of you !

1018
01:29:59,918 --> 01:30:01,886
l won't let you down, sir.
Please give me one opportunity

1019
01:30:02,087 --> 01:30:05,887
The best stuntmen in the industry
have refused me

1020
01:30:06,125 --> 01:30:09,561
You think you are the cat's whiskers?
- l don't care for my life

1021
01:30:10,029 --> 01:30:14,056
l'm not scared. l'll sign
any document you want me to

1022
01:30:14,666 --> 01:30:16,395
One chance, please

1023
01:30:26,645 --> 01:30:28,408
lt's only to please you, Ma

1024
01:30:29,915 --> 01:30:34,750
Aditya's pride must not take a beating
... l got to take care of that too

1025
01:30:35,120 --> 01:30:36,678
My dear, your baby...

1026
01:30:36,889 --> 01:30:40,416
Nothing will happen.
There will be no problems, l promise

1027
01:30:43,162 --> 01:30:48,600
lf Adi doesn't bring food tonight,
l'll myself come to you...

1028
01:30:49,601 --> 01:30:50,829
and you'll feed me

1029
01:31:06,485 --> 01:31:07,782
My dear...

1030
01:31:08,720 --> 01:31:10,517
God willing, you won't have
to come here

1031
01:31:17,162 --> 01:31:19,130
lt's very risky.
- lt's okay

1032
01:31:19,832 --> 01:31:22,460
But l'll accept only cash.
- See those dogs?

1033
01:31:22,968 --> 01:31:26,131
They've been starving for two days.
- My baby is starving too

1034
01:31:26,538 --> 01:31:28,631
A big chunk of flesh will be tied
to your arm

1035
01:31:30,175 --> 01:31:33,144
Once the shoot is on,
nobody can help you, get that?

1036
01:31:33,846 --> 01:31:35,473
Those wild dogs will pounce on you

1037
01:31:36,715 --> 01:31:38,478
l'll get the money
after the shot, will l ?

1038
01:31:43,021 --> 01:31:46,479
Tell the director that we've found
a stuntman. Give him the dress

1039
01:34:53,145 --> 01:34:54,112
Cut!

1040
01:34:54,446 --> 01:34:56,937
What are you watching?
Save him. Go

1041
01:35:00,686 --> 01:35:04,417
Moron ! Couldn't you have
asked for help?

1042
01:35:05,590 --> 01:35:07,421
Are you blind? Get first aid

1043
01:35:07,926 --> 01:35:10,417
Had these dogs torn you apart,
l'd have been jailed

1044
01:35:11,463 --> 01:35:14,091
Don't ever show me your face!
And never do stunts again, okay

1045
01:35:14,466 --> 01:35:16,161
Hang on

1046
01:35:16,601 --> 01:35:18,762
Are you alright, young man
- l'm absolutely fine.

1047
01:35:18,937 --> 01:35:22,896
Just tell him to give my money
- Give him his money, right now

1048
01:35:29,648 --> 01:35:32,776
Thank you
- Young man, what's your name?

1049
01:35:35,954 --> 01:35:39,446
Name? l'm trying to
make a name, sir

1050
01:35:40,759 --> 01:35:43,023
The day l make it, you will
come to know

1051
01:35:44,029 --> 01:35:45,462
Thank you

1052
01:35:53,605 --> 01:35:55,095
Here...

1053
01:35:55,707 --> 01:35:59,609
Have food, while l go and see him

1054
01:36:00,145 --> 01:36:02,113
They've taken daddy
to the hospital, Adi

1055
01:37:15,487 --> 01:37:17,682
lshwar Chandra Thakur?
- Room no 510

1056
01:37:40,679 --> 01:37:42,476
What madness is this?
Adi will find out

1057
01:37:42,781 --> 01:37:46,649
Doctor, listen... please try
to understand

1058
01:38:11,143 --> 01:38:15,443
My son has set out to become a hero.
l don't know when he'll make it

1059
01:38:16,248 --> 01:38:19,843
We are here.
We'll take care of Pooja

1060
01:38:20,052 --> 01:38:22,782
This ward is fine,
she will stay here

1061
01:38:24,990 --> 01:38:26,457
He's right, doctor

1062
01:38:28,026 --> 01:38:30,995
My baby will be born
in this very room

1063
01:38:31,496 --> 01:38:35,796
Whether l become a hero or not,
l'll pay up, even if l have to beg

1064
01:38:36,668 --> 01:38:40,627
And doctor, book the room
in my name

1065
01:38:42,574 --> 01:38:45,805
Ma... the rent for the house

1066
01:38:46,244 --> 01:38:49,805
Ask him to put the fuse back...

1067
01:38:49,982 --> 01:38:53,418
so that there's light
in my house again

1068
01:39:05,464 --> 01:39:07,432
''No complaints, no protests...''

1069
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,434
''no sharing either''

1070
01:39:11,703 --> 01:39:14,604
''Come, let's embrace...''

1071
01:39:14,940 --> 01:39:16,908
''and shed a tear''

1072
01:39:17,709 --> 01:39:23,614
''The flames of constraints
burn me''

1073
01:39:25,150 --> 01:39:29,780
''No one knows my pain''

1074
01:39:37,496 --> 01:39:42,456
''My heart's rent''

1075
01:39:43,835 --> 01:39:48,636
''Breath betrays me''

1076
01:39:50,075 --> 01:39:54,739
''Time looks down on me''

1077
01:40:13,131 --> 01:40:14,758
My will

1078
01:40:16,001 --> 01:40:17,969
l've bequeathed everything to Adi

1079
01:40:28,980 --> 01:40:30,948
Life insurance policy

1080
01:40:32,884 --> 01:40:34,943
The first step towards
securing our child's future

1081
01:40:35,987 --> 01:40:37,614
Our child is now secured

1082
01:40:58,677 --> 01:41:03,478
''l love you''

1083
01:41:04,683 --> 01:41:09,484
''Everything that's mine
belongs to you''

1084
01:41:10,689 --> 01:41:12,486
''You have...''

1085
01:41:12,691 --> 01:41:14,659
''no idea...''

1086
01:41:17,195 --> 01:41:19,823
''you are my heartbeat...''

1087
01:41:20,232 --> 01:41:22,200
''you mean the very life to me''

1088
01:41:23,568 --> 01:41:26,002
''You make...''

1089
01:41:26,538 --> 01:41:29,006
''my story''

1090
01:41:29,241 --> 01:41:33,507
''Believe it or not''

1091
01:41:34,980 --> 01:41:37,505
''lt's a terrible point in life''

1092
01:41:38,116 --> 01:41:40,846
''l haven't lost you,
neither do l have you''

1093
01:41:41,253 --> 01:41:43,744
''Though l wish...''

1094
01:41:44,022 --> 01:41:46,513
''we can't unite''

1095
01:41:54,599 --> 01:41:59,468
''My heart's rent''

1096
01:43:29,728 --> 01:43:31,992
l got to go to the dance class,
then the gym

1097
01:43:32,530 --> 01:43:34,498
We got to rehearse the lines
in the evening

1098
01:43:35,066 --> 01:43:38,001
l've boiled the milk,
the sandwich is ready too

1099
01:43:38,703 --> 01:43:43,003
l've heated the water too.
What else do you want, princess?

1100
01:43:45,543 --> 01:43:49,172
l just want to see you
- My baby wants to see me!

1101
01:43:49,914 --> 01:43:52,439
See me on the 70mm screen

1102
01:43:52,984 --> 01:43:55,953
After l win the contest,
we'll have a real ball...

1103
01:43:56,154 --> 01:43:58,122
in our new house.
You'll say, ''lshwar...''

1104
01:43:58,990 --> 01:44:02,448
''get me water.
lshwar, get me juice''

1105
01:44:02,794 --> 01:44:04,762
''lshwar, get the car''

1106
01:44:05,196 --> 01:44:07,460
''lshwar...''
- lshwar?

1107
01:44:07,832 --> 01:44:10,460
Yes. l'll have a servant
by that name

1108
01:44:10,869 --> 01:44:14,464
l'll put out an advertisement.
Servant, gardener, chef, chauffeur...''

1109
01:44:14,873 --> 01:44:17,137
''apply if your name is lshwar,
else don't...''

1110
01:44:19,177 --> 01:44:20,474
Madcap

1111
01:44:22,013 --> 01:44:24,982
Our new life will drive you crazy

1112
01:44:26,017 --> 01:44:27,644

1114
01:44:34,092 --> 01:44:38,153
Look... l made this doll,
for my grandson

1115
01:44:40,532 --> 01:44:43,990
His name is Jerry, the giraffe

1116
01:44:44,336 --> 01:44:46,031
l'll be the first one who plays
with my grandson

1117
01:44:48,707 --> 01:44:53,110
l'll show him. He told me to
use my baby to beg, didn't he?

1118
01:44:53,945 --> 01:44:55,435
No problem

1119
01:44:55,647 --> 01:44:59,947
Every one will play with my baby,
but l won't let him even see his face

1120
01:45:00,151 --> 01:45:01,448
No way, Pooja

1121
01:45:02,487 --> 01:45:04,455
Will l get to see my grandson?

1122
01:45:09,027 --> 01:45:10,961
l won't let you leave!

1123
01:45:12,197 --> 01:45:16,793
l'll go to heaven and plead with God.
l'll take Laxman and Natu along too

1124
01:45:17,302 --> 01:45:20,965
God! Just imagine.
Laxman will say...

1125
01:45:22,173 --> 01:45:25,973
''Who is this celestial beauty?
Rambha?''

1126
01:45:27,946 --> 01:45:31,541
''Who is Menaka? A dancer?''

1127
01:45:32,283 --> 01:45:34,148
Natu-bhai will say...

1128
01:45:34,686 --> 01:45:38,144
''Menaka's dance is just nothing.
My wife dances like Britney Spears''

1129
01:45:42,527 --> 01:45:43,494
Jokes

1130
01:45:45,997 --> 01:45:47,965
Keep joking like this, Sumi...

1131
01:45:49,667 --> 01:45:51,430
till the end

1132
01:45:54,773 --> 01:45:56,741
Do l have a choice?

1133
01:46:07,018 --> 01:46:09,782
Lord, don't let him pick up
the phone. Please

1134
01:46:14,659 --> 01:46:16,627
Hello
- Damn, it's him!

1135
01:46:18,196 --> 01:46:19,527
Hello
- Who?

1136
01:46:19,664 --> 01:46:21,461
Natu, from Australia

1137
01:46:22,634 --> 01:46:24,465
Give this message to lshwar Chandra

1138
01:46:24,636 --> 01:46:27,969
Listen properly. We're returning
to lndia the day after

1139
01:46:28,540 --> 01:46:31,475
We're returning to lndia
the day after by flight

1140
01:46:31,676 --> 01:46:34,474
After landing,
we'll take a cab home

1141
01:46:34,813 --> 01:46:38,476
Then we'll freshen up,
eat and sleep...

1142
01:46:38,716 --> 01:46:40,980
wake up next morning, have breakfast
and then come to meet you folks. Okay?

1143
01:46:41,219 --> 01:46:43,483
You get that?
- Who? l ?

1144
01:46:43,855 --> 01:46:47,154
Who am l talking to then, pesticide?
- How'd l know?

1145
01:46:48,526 --> 01:46:51,086
l can't see you on the phone

1146
01:46:52,997 --> 01:46:57,093
My mistake, boss. l hold my ears
in contempt

1147
01:46:57,502 --> 01:46:59,436
How can you hold your ears
with two hands?

1148
01:46:59,804 --> 01:47:03,706
Does one use four hands?
- You said you had ten heads

1149
01:47:03,908 --> 01:47:05,773
How well you remember that,
you devil!

1150
01:47:06,811 --> 01:47:09,439
Will you give my message or not?
- What do you say?

1151
01:47:09,647 --> 01:47:12,445
Should l ? Or should l not?
- Please convey

1152
01:47:12,884 --> 01:47:15,444
What's the message?
- Hang on, let me recollect

1153
01:47:15,854 --> 01:47:17,947
Sure.
- The day after...

1154
01:47:19,023 --> 01:47:22,959
you will reach the bathroom,
and then home

1155
01:47:23,228 --> 01:47:27,460
Then you'll go to the airport,
where you will take a bath...

1156
01:47:28,666 --> 01:47:31,464
eat and then you'll sleep
in the car

1157
01:47:32,504 --> 01:47:35,962
You'll wake up in the morning
and fly to Australia to meet the boss

1158
01:47:36,241 --> 01:47:39,210
Right, tell them,
they'll understand. All right?

1159
01:47:39,944 --> 01:47:42,469
But l don't understand.
- Don't understand what?

1160
01:47:42,714 --> 01:47:45,148
Why'd you go to Australia
to meet the boss?

1161
01:47:46,217 --> 01:47:49,812
The boss is here.
- My enemy! Demon !

1162
01:47:50,121 --> 01:47:54,751
Louse! Bloody ass!
- Should l also inform all of them?

1163
01:48:01,766 --> 01:48:04,428
lshwar Chandra... we're back
from Australia

1164
01:48:05,470 --> 01:48:07,233
Where are you, mite?

1165
01:48:07,639 --> 01:48:10,767
Looks so quiet.
- Laxman must've driven everyone out

1166
01:48:17,649 --> 01:48:19,583
My boss is...
- The demon !

1167
01:48:19,817 --> 01:48:21,045
What happened?
- Nothing. Stay away

1168
01:48:21,219 --> 01:48:23,449
Why are you running?
- l'm wearing a track suit

1169
01:48:23,788 --> 01:48:25,779
How long will you run?
- Give me his remote control

1170
01:48:26,090 --> 01:48:28,024
Want to watch tv?
- Remove his batteries!

1171
01:48:28,192 --> 01:48:30,160
You will tire yourself out

1172
01:48:30,762 --> 01:48:33,458
The boss and his wife might be late...
- Never mind. Stay away!

1173
01:48:33,765 --> 01:48:36,131
You will get tired.
- l won't

1174
01:48:36,534 --> 01:48:38,468
Shall l serve food?
- Call the police!

1175
01:48:38,636 --> 01:48:40,604
Shall l get some juice?
- Nothing. Call the police

1176
01:48:43,041 --> 01:48:45,134
He should be tied and locked up.
He's gone wild

1177
01:48:46,210 --> 01:48:50,476
Go inside, and get two glasses
of chilled water, now

1178
01:48:51,149 --> 01:48:52,741
Go on

1179
01:48:54,986 --> 01:48:57,921
Come, he won't do anything.
- He should be tied up

1180
01:48:58,222 --> 01:49:01,919
Welcome Natu-bhai. Greetings

1181
01:49:02,126 --> 01:49:04,424
Hi there... well, in a track suit

1182
01:49:04,729 --> 01:49:08,426
This is nothing. My mother-in-law
would wear a swimsuit

1183
01:49:08,700 --> 01:49:10,668
For a jog?
- ln the swimming pool

1184
01:49:10,935 --> 01:49:14,427
When my father-in-law was alive,
she used to wear a crimson swimsuit

1185
01:49:14,772 --> 01:49:16,672
After he died...
- She stopped swimming

1186
01:49:16,808 --> 01:49:19,436
She started wearing white swimsuits.
Old-fashioned people, you see

1187
01:49:19,844 --> 01:49:22,938
But she didn't stop swimming, health
conscious as she was, unlike you

1188
01:49:23,982 --> 01:49:26,951
Why do you drag me in?
- Look at your face. Weary

1189
01:49:27,285 --> 01:49:31,449
All for driving your son out.
- Nothing of that sort, l'm fine

1190
01:49:31,756 --> 01:49:33,587
How was your Australian trip?

1191
01:49:34,025 --> 01:49:37,961
Australia...great!
My God fantastic

1192
01:49:38,162 --> 01:49:41,154
lndia is just nothing. Even
little children speak English there

1193
01:49:43,201 --> 01:49:45,465
Shall we go and meet Pooja?
- Why not? Let's go

1194
01:49:46,504 --> 01:49:47,971
One minute

1195
01:49:51,142 --> 01:49:56,739
Mangoes for Aditya. Don't tell him
that l gave them, or he won't eat

1196
01:49:57,615 --> 01:49:59,412
Tell him you got it

1197
01:50:00,918 --> 01:50:04,012
This is nothing, don't worry.
- l didn't tell you anything

1198
01:50:04,522 --> 01:50:06,956
l'll explain to him
Don't you worry

1199
01:50:07,759 --> 01:50:09,056
But Natu-bhai...

1200
01:50:09,727 --> 01:50:11,422
l'll handle everything

1201
01:50:20,138 --> 01:50:22,936
l'm telling you
You definitely going to win

1202
01:50:30,014 --> 01:50:30,981
Mummy!

1203
01:50:34,719 --> 01:50:35,686
Daddy!

1204
01:50:37,855 --> 01:50:39,823
How are you, Mom?
- l'm fine, dear

1205
01:50:44,996 --> 01:50:45,963
Mangoes!

1206
01:50:47,065 --> 01:50:49,033
Let me show you my kitchen, come on

1207
01:50:50,001 --> 01:50:51,798
ls everything okay,dear?

1208
01:50:56,207 --> 01:50:58,175
Dad, please come inside... please sit

1209
01:50:59,544 --> 01:51:01,808
Can you explain how
one must sit there?

1210
01:51:04,749 --> 01:51:06,478
Well...
- Who do you think you are?

1211
01:51:08,186 --> 01:51:10,814
How dare you put my daughter up
in such a filthy place?

1212
01:51:14,058 --> 01:51:15,491
Please come inside...

1213
01:51:16,994 --> 01:51:18,825
Yes?
- Pack Pooja's bags

1214
01:51:19,030 --> 01:51:20,497
But daddy l...

1215
01:51:21,666 --> 01:51:23,998
You eloped, l didn't complain

1216
01:51:24,268 --> 01:51:26,998
This is nothing. Sangeeta ran off
twice after marriage!

1217
01:51:27,572 --> 01:51:30,837
That's a reason to console myself.
But there's a limit to everything

1218
01:51:31,275 --> 01:51:33,505
Aditya, at least think of the baby

1219
01:51:33,745 --> 01:51:35,713
That's the reason l toil
day and night, dad

1220
01:51:36,714 --> 01:51:39,842
After the contest...
- After you win, right?

1221
01:51:40,051 --> 01:51:41,780
The father and son are at loggerheads.
Why must my daughter bear the brunt?

1222
01:51:42,987 --> 01:51:45,512
Let us live, l beg of you !
- What are you saying, papa?

1223
01:51:47,291 --> 01:51:50,658
l can understand what a father goes
through when his child is in trouble

1224
01:51:52,764 --> 01:51:54,061
Go on, dad

1225
01:51:55,066 --> 01:51:57,034
Either you send Pooja with us...

1226
01:51:59,570 --> 01:52:01,538
or compromise with your father
and go back home

1227
01:52:08,746 --> 01:52:11,476
l'll take Pooja home
- No need for that!

1228
01:52:13,217 --> 01:52:15,981
You have worked so much for
this contest. You will surely win

1229
01:52:17,221 --> 01:52:19,155
Please go away.
- Don't be stubborn, Pooja

1230
01:52:19,524 --> 01:52:21,151
Not l, you are being stubborn

1231
01:52:22,026 --> 01:52:23,994
l have no problems here

1232
01:52:24,562 --> 01:52:28,498
What Adi is doing for me and the baby,
is beyond compare

1233
01:52:28,866 --> 01:52:30,629
Where will the baby be born?
ln some Municipal hospital?

1234
01:52:31,669 --> 01:52:34,638
Are all the normal babies
born only in five-star hospitals?

1235
01:52:35,540 --> 01:52:36,507
No!

1236
01:52:37,241 --> 01:52:41,007
As long as Adi is with me,
it won't be hard for my baby

1237
01:52:43,014 --> 01:52:44,504
Trust me, papa

1238
01:52:44,882 --> 01:52:50,218
l'm carrying, but it is Adi
who's been the real mother

1239
01:52:53,791 --> 01:52:55,782
What a sacrifices!

1240
01:52:56,761 --> 01:52:58,854
You pale before her
What a sacrifices!

1241
01:52:59,096 --> 01:53:02,827
l had told lshwar Chandra,
Pooja will never desert Aditya

1242
01:53:07,305 --> 01:53:09,705
Still he told me to try
and get them separated

1243
01:53:12,076 --> 01:53:13,043
lmpossible!

1244
01:53:13,511 --> 01:53:15,479
He told you not to tell him!

1245
01:53:19,951 --> 01:53:21,816
So, to set me and Pooja apart...

1246
01:53:24,622 --> 01:53:26,146
dad sent you here, right?

1247
01:53:28,059 --> 01:53:29,026
Bye

1248
01:53:47,211 --> 01:53:49,008
Dad tried to set us apart

1249
01:53:50,815 --> 01:53:53,443
He wants to separates us

1250
01:53:53,818 --> 01:53:55,445
How could he do that?

1251
01:53:57,922 --> 01:53:59,446
l goofed

1252
01:54:00,024 --> 01:54:01,992
Can't l shoot him?
- No

1253
01:54:02,493 --> 01:54:05,462
l don't know how l goofed.
l'm a born actor

1254
01:54:05,730 --> 01:54:09,962
Really?
- Yes. ln school, l acted as a dog

1255
01:54:10,768 --> 01:54:13,794
Even today the principal and teachers
treat me like a dog

1256
01:54:14,972 --> 01:54:17,463
Let me commit this one murder, Sumi.
Just one

1257
01:54:17,742 --> 01:54:20,643
This is nothing, it'll all be fine.
- Fine, my foot!

1258
01:54:21,679 --> 01:54:23,647
He must be detesting me now

1259
01:54:25,049 --> 01:54:26,778
Dog, eh !

1260
01:54:33,691 --> 01:54:35,488
Mangoes, your favourite

1261
01:54:36,694 --> 01:54:38,491
Eat quickly, you got to go

1262
01:54:42,099 --> 01:54:43,726
Dad sent these

1263
01:54:45,670 --> 01:54:47,501
Mom brought them, please

1264
01:54:50,641 --> 01:54:52,438
Dad sent these for me

1265
01:54:56,681 --> 01:55:00,447
Same colour, same shape...

1266
01:55:02,186 --> 01:55:03,949
same smell

1267
01:55:05,189 --> 01:55:10,126
27 years... every season,
dad would treat me to these mangoes

1268
01:55:11,495 --> 01:55:13,463
C'mon, how could l forget it.

1269
01:55:15,032 --> 01:55:16,795
l know very well

1270
01:55:30,614 --> 01:55:31,979
Ma!

1271
01:55:37,054 --> 01:55:41,150
Come inside, son.
- Alms... you sent over

1272
01:55:42,860 --> 01:55:44,487
We're not beggars

1273
01:55:45,196 --> 01:55:47,994
You'd rather not do such favours

1274
01:55:49,567 --> 01:55:51,091
Tell him

1275
01:55:52,803 --> 01:55:55,101
Adi, he sent them over
because you like mangoes, son

1276
01:55:57,174 --> 01:56:00,769
Someone trying to break
my family apart... l hate it

1277
01:56:01,645 --> 01:56:03,613
As for the favours,
tell him that...

1278
01:56:04,482 --> 01:56:08,441
l hereby break all ties with him

1279
01:56:08,953 --> 01:56:11,148
Besides, l've stopped eating mangoes
from today

1280
01:58:21,652 --> 01:58:24,951
Yes

1281
01:58:26,657 --> 01:58:27,624
Yes

1282
01:58:28,826 --> 01:58:30,453
Yes, hold on

1283
01:58:42,173 --> 01:58:43,800
Adi... phone

1284
01:58:45,976 --> 01:58:46,943
Phone

1285
01:59:09,900 --> 01:59:12,425
Yes, it's me.
- What are they saying?

1286
01:59:12,636 --> 01:59:15,605
Hang on... Yes, tell me.
Sure, l'll send three photographs

1287
01:59:18,242 --> 01:59:19,436
Okay... alright
Thank you very much

1288
01:59:20,644 --> 01:59:22,441
What is it, son?

1289
01:59:24,848 --> 01:59:28,113
l've come first, dad!
- Congratulations, son

1290
01:59:28,652 --> 01:59:31,450
lt was one-sided.
l got the most marks

1291
01:59:31,622 --> 01:59:35,456
You will come first, son !
Just watch

1292
01:59:37,027 --> 01:59:40,963
l'll win, dad!
- You will win, son. You are...

1293
01:59:45,936 --> 01:59:46,903
Sorry...

1294
01:59:47,838 --> 01:59:49,806
l entered your house, by mistake

1295
01:59:51,108 --> 01:59:53,076
You embraced me, by mistake

1296
01:59:53,944 --> 01:59:55,912
You called me Daddy, by mistake

1297
01:59:58,148 --> 02:00:01,743
You proved how much you love
your daddy, by mistake

1298
02:00:01,986 --> 02:00:05,922
No way. ln my excitement l entered,
else who wants to come in this house?

1299
02:00:06,123 --> 02:00:07,750
And, l don't love you

1300
02:00:07,992 --> 02:00:10,552
For that matter, even
l don't love you

1301
02:00:11,962 --> 02:00:15,420
l'm not happy either.
- Why would you be happy? You've lost!

1302
02:00:16,033 --> 02:00:20,094
Hardly matters. What worries me is
that l've lost a part-time servant

1303
02:00:21,005 --> 02:00:23,599
You won't work for me anymore.
- l won't even stay in that outhouse

1304
02:00:23,941 --> 02:00:28,844
Oh ! l'll have to find a servant
to keep the outhouse clean

1305
02:00:29,013 --> 02:00:31,982
Besides, it's hard to find
honest servants

1306
02:00:32,283 --> 02:00:37,118
So right! lt's even harder for me,
since l'm looking for a special servant

1307
02:00:38,822 --> 02:00:40,449
A servant called lshwar Chandra

1308
02:00:49,566 --> 02:00:51,193
Employ him, Adi

1309
02:00:52,936 --> 02:00:54,801
At least he'll remind you of me

1310
02:00:55,172 --> 02:00:58,141
No way. l won't even let you
inside my house

1311
02:00:59,843 --> 02:01:02,641
Cancel. Let's cancel this new game

1312
02:01:04,081 --> 02:01:07,482
Let me in. At least,
to play with your children

1313
02:01:08,185 --> 02:01:10,881
C'mon
- l hate you, dad!

1314
02:01:12,056 --> 02:01:13,819
l just hate you

1315
02:01:15,059 --> 02:01:18,995
l can never be a responsible father.
lsn't that you what you always said?

1316
02:01:19,596 --> 02:01:22,827
l promise, l'll prove you wrong.
My son will never ask me...

1317
02:01:23,033 --> 02:01:25,160
''Why did you sire me if you
had no means to rear me?''

1318
02:01:26,704 --> 02:01:30,003
l'll give him all the joys.
l'll give him everything. l will...

1319
02:01:32,242 --> 02:01:35,006
Why am l telling you all this?
What would you know...

1320
02:01:35,279 --> 02:01:39,010
about a father's love for his child?
You will never understand

1321
02:01:39,883 --> 02:01:43,011
True, because l didn't sire you,
l plucked you out of a mango tree

1322
02:01:44,054 --> 02:01:46,022
So what it means to be a father...
- You have no idea at all!

1323
02:01:48,225 --> 02:01:50,022
l agree l was irresponsible

1324
02:01:51,261 --> 02:01:54,924
But who was responsible for it?
You were

1325
02:01:55,766 --> 02:01:57,700
l only wanted to hold your finger
to walk steadily...

1326
02:01:58,102 --> 02:02:00,070
but you gladly gave me your arm

1327
02:02:01,038 --> 02:02:02,972
Who was judged later?

1328
02:02:04,174 --> 02:02:06,972
l was. That, l strayed, l'm spoilt

1329
02:02:08,712 --> 02:02:10,612
lf only l was left to stand
on my feet

1330
02:02:11,882 --> 02:02:14,942
You always hoisted me on your shoulders
and showed me the world below

1331
02:02:16,186 --> 02:02:19,155
l won't do that with my son.
l'll give him a good upbringing

1332
02:02:19,623 --> 02:02:23,957
Still if he is spoilt or strays,
l'll give him time to come around

1333
02:02:24,728 --> 02:02:28,494
Unlike you, l won't drive him
and his pregnant wife out

1334
02:02:29,066 --> 02:02:31,193
l won't consider him as my enemy
and humiliate him

1335
02:02:31,935 --> 02:02:33,994
And l'll never try to separate him
from his wife

1336
02:02:36,039 --> 02:02:38,507
lt was so cheap of you, dad

1337
02:02:39,543 --> 02:02:41,170
l hate you !

1338
02:02:42,079 --> 02:02:44,513
Try to swap places with me,
at least try

1339
02:02:45,082 --> 02:02:46,982
You'll know how it hurts

1340
02:02:48,285 --> 02:02:50,515
l'd be glad to be in your shoes, Adi

1341
02:02:52,656 --> 02:02:55,784
But how can l ask you to put
yourself in mine?

1342
02:02:56,026 --> 02:02:57,459
Why not?

1343
02:03:03,934 --> 02:03:05,799
You are right, son

1344
02:03:06,637 --> 02:03:08,468
You're right

1345
02:03:09,173 --> 02:03:11,141
l've been unfair to you

1346
02:03:13,944 --> 02:03:15,707
l played the biggest part in misguiding
you. l accept.

1347
02:03:15,913 --> 02:03:18,973
l should've handled you
with patience...

1348
02:03:20,050 --> 02:03:22,018
given you more time...
- Goodbye, dad

1349
02:03:25,022 --> 02:03:26,649
l want nothing

1350
02:03:28,525 --> 02:03:30,550
Neither your defence,
nor your time

1351
02:03:37,968 --> 02:03:40,232
To give you time,
don't l myself need time?

1352
02:03:44,675 --> 02:03:46,836
Don't cast me away
from your life, son

1353
02:03:49,880 --> 02:03:53,782
As it is, l'm leaving... for good

1354
02:04:14,204 --> 02:04:15,796
Thank you

1355
02:04:16,673 --> 02:04:20,131
Here are some extra passes.
lf you want to invite someone...

1356
02:04:22,679 --> 02:04:24,476
My parents are coming

1357
02:04:25,716 --> 02:04:29,482
Anyone else...?
- Your parents

1358
02:04:31,688 --> 02:04:33,485
lnvite Ma

1359
02:04:35,225 --> 02:04:38,490
And daddy?
- l don't want to invite him

1360
02:04:41,198 --> 02:04:45,828
Will she come alone? Has she ever
gone out without him?

1361
02:04:53,644 --> 02:04:56,112
Pooja... Adi...

1362
02:04:57,814 --> 02:04:59,782
he must be waiting for you

1363
02:05:01,151 --> 02:05:03,119
Have l ever gone out without you?

1364
02:05:05,022 --> 02:05:08,788
You'll have to get
into the habit, Sumi

1365
02:05:11,028 --> 02:05:12,791
Must get into the habit

1366
02:05:16,667 --> 02:05:19,966
You'll have to fight it out!
Tonight is Adi's final round

1367
02:05:20,971 --> 02:05:22,802
Don't you want to see him win?

1368
02:05:25,108 --> 02:05:26,803
l want to go, Sumi

1369
02:05:28,845 --> 02:05:29,812
l...

1370
02:05:31,682 --> 02:05:34,981
l have very little time

1371
02:05:37,120 --> 02:05:40,146
l want to see Adi once

1372
02:05:49,533 --> 02:05:51,933
Nobody is answering the phone.
- l'm not inviting him

1373
02:05:52,603 --> 02:05:54,935
lf he wants to come, he can.
But l'm not inviting him

1374
02:05:56,807 --> 02:05:58,604
Okay.
- Why did you disconnect?

1375
02:05:59,009 --> 02:06:01,443
What's the point when you are
not interested?

1376
02:06:03,213 --> 02:06:06,444
lf he wants to come, fine.
l'm not stopping him

1377
02:06:06,817 --> 02:06:08,785
Really? Such a big heart

1378
02:06:09,653 --> 02:06:13,453
lf you could do dad a favour,
why don't you do me a favour?

1379
02:06:14,024 --> 02:06:15,958
Try to be honest with yourself

1380
02:06:16,627 --> 02:06:19,960
lt's the greatest day of your life,
and you want him by your side

1381
02:06:20,163 --> 02:06:22,791
Just admit it. lt's not a big deal

1382
02:06:34,645 --> 02:06:37,637
Sumi, l want to see Adi win

1383
02:06:39,516 --> 02:06:41,484
l want to play with his baby

1384
02:06:42,552 --> 02:06:44,486
You will, certainly

1385
02:06:45,088 --> 02:06:47,056
We're fighting against time

1386
02:06:48,859 --> 02:06:50,486
We have to beat time

1387
02:06:59,136 --> 02:07:00,763
This is cheating, friend

1388
02:07:02,939 --> 02:07:04,770
Who will l fight with now?

1389
02:07:08,045 --> 02:07:09,774
Don't hurt me, Natu-bhai

1390
02:07:10,681 --> 02:07:13,946
You will find many to fight with.
l'm nothing

1391
02:07:15,552 --> 02:07:17,452
Call on daddy's cellphone

1392
02:07:19,656 --> 02:07:23,956
What do l say?
- Ask him to come, at least to bless

1393
02:07:27,497 --> 02:07:31,593
l'll tell him, there are extra passes,
he can come if he wants to

1394
02:07:32,536 --> 02:07:34,128
Okay, call

1395
02:07:35,205 --> 02:07:36,968
l'll say that

1396
02:07:45,916 --> 02:07:47,713
Yes, son?
- You're coming, aren't you, mama?

1397
02:07:47,918 --> 02:07:49,283
Yes, son

1398
02:07:50,520 --> 02:07:52,420
And daddy?
- You don't object, do you?

1399
02:07:52,789 --> 02:07:54,916
l don't, but...
- Talk to daddy

1400
02:08:00,464 --> 02:08:02,955
ls he nearby?
- Yes. Shall l give him the phone?

1401
02:08:04,601 --> 02:08:05,568
Yes

1402
02:08:05,969 --> 02:08:07,095
Hang on

1403
02:08:07,471 --> 02:08:09,439
Adi, wants to talk to me

1404
02:08:16,012 --> 02:08:19,948
Hello.
Bloody obstinate wastrel!

1405
02:08:20,884 --> 02:08:22,852
l know you're going to become
a great star

1406
02:08:23,687 --> 02:08:25,951
But l won't take
any of your starry airs

1407
02:08:28,024 --> 02:08:31,016
You can come if you...
- l'll come even if you deny me

1408
02:08:31,561 --> 02:08:33,461
What will you do?

1409
02:08:36,700 --> 02:08:38,463
Okay, bye.
- Son...

1410
02:08:41,671 --> 02:08:42,797
Son...

1411
02:08:44,508 --> 02:08:45,975
l love you

1412
02:08:49,112 --> 02:08:52,809
Will you let me play with your baby?

1413
02:08:53,483 --> 02:08:54,745
Bye

1414
02:09:04,861 --> 02:09:06,761
l just hate him, Pooja

1415
02:09:07,130 --> 02:09:08,927
He always does this to me

1416
02:09:11,635 --> 02:09:13,432
But l can't live without him

1417
02:09:15,005 --> 02:09:18,600
You know why?
Because l love him

1418
02:09:35,559 --> 02:09:37,459
We are at the venue

1419
02:09:39,162 --> 02:09:40,789
We've reached the venue

1420
02:09:44,201 --> 02:09:45,828
Will you manage?

1421
02:09:47,037 --> 02:09:50,473
Adi learnt that trait from me,
not from you

1422
02:09:53,210 --> 02:09:56,907
Don't worry.
l must tell him

1423
02:10:03,620 --> 02:10:04,587
Shawl?

1424
02:10:19,536 --> 02:10:21,470
All the best, son.
- Thank you, Ma

1425
02:10:21,638 --> 02:10:23,105
God bless you

1426
02:10:23,473 --> 02:10:25,100
May you win

1427
02:10:28,178 --> 02:10:30,112
Can l give you my blessings?

1428
02:10:30,814 --> 02:10:32,441
Go ahead

1429
02:10:33,216 --> 02:10:36,117
Let it hurt you more
when l win before the world

1430
02:10:37,254 --> 02:10:38,619
Moron

1431
02:10:39,823 --> 02:10:41,791
You're going to become a father

1432
02:10:42,659 --> 02:10:44,456
Ask yourself

1433
02:10:45,061 --> 02:10:47,621
Can any father be hurt
seeing his son win?

1434
02:10:49,799 --> 02:10:51,460
All the best

1435
02:10:52,035 --> 02:10:54,970
Actually, this is for your baby...

1436
02:10:55,171 --> 02:10:56,638
No, thanks

1437
02:11:02,212 --> 02:11:03,179
Please

1438
02:11:06,783 --> 02:11:08,978
He brought the doll purposely,
so that l...

1439
02:11:10,787 --> 02:11:12,982
Nothing would've gone wrong
had you accepted it

1440
02:11:13,957 --> 02:11:15,982
Get a hold on yourself, Natu-bhai

1441
02:11:18,061 --> 02:11:19,995
My disease is just nothing

1442
02:11:21,131 --> 02:11:24,828
Your grandfather must've had
two cancers

1443
02:11:27,771 --> 02:11:29,500
Enough now

1444
02:11:30,273 --> 02:11:32,241
lf Adi sees you, all hell
will break lose. Please

1445
02:11:33,843 --> 02:11:38,507
Wipe your tears.
- l tell you, let alone me...

1446
02:11:39,916 --> 02:11:42,680
no father can compare himself
with lshwar Chandra

1447
02:11:45,855 --> 02:11:48,517
For the sake of their children,
parents give up their lives

1448
02:11:50,694 --> 02:11:52,958
But you have even defied death

1449
02:11:56,032 --> 02:11:58,466
l could achieve nothing in life

1450
02:12:01,004 --> 02:12:02,801
But before l die...

1451
02:12:03,506 --> 02:12:05,804
if l could set an example for Adi,
it'll be worth it

1452
02:12:06,977 --> 02:12:10,970
So that his son calls Adi
the best father in the world

1453
02:12:17,053 --> 02:12:20,819
lf something happens to me,
give this doll to Adi...

1454
02:12:23,727 --> 02:12:25,490
Where's the doll?

1455
02:12:27,063 --> 02:12:29,156
He has found out, Sumi.
- What?

1456
02:12:29,532 --> 02:12:31,659
He has found out.
- What are you saying?

1457
02:12:32,035 --> 02:12:35,004
He must've overheard, Sumi.
- Had he heard...

1458
02:12:35,205 --> 02:12:39,164
he'd have broken down before you.
- That's what l fear. We must...

1459
02:12:39,542 --> 02:12:41,009
go inside

1460
02:12:43,947 --> 02:12:45,847
We'll sit at the back

1461
02:12:52,822 --> 02:12:56,451
And now we present contestant
number 9, Aditya Thakur

1462
02:13:21,217 --> 02:13:22,809
Respected judges...

1463
02:13:23,586 --> 02:13:24,883
dear spectators...

1464
02:13:25,055 --> 02:13:29,014
and the millions of people
watching this talent contest live...

1465
02:13:32,796 --> 02:13:38,496
l know l'll be kicked out of
this contest in a few minutes

1466
02:13:41,971 --> 02:13:44,166
But l have to win...

1467
02:13:45,208 --> 02:13:47,176
the final race against lshwar

1468
02:13:48,011 --> 02:13:49,103
He knows!

1469
02:13:49,279 --> 02:13:57,778
And that's why, instead of performing,
l'd like to place a request before you

1470
02:13:58,021 --> 02:13:59,989
Stop him, Sumi! What's he doing?

1471
02:14:01,491 --> 02:14:03,459
What are your doing?
- Adi! Adi!

1472
02:14:04,227 --> 02:14:06,991
My father wants to see my baby...

1473
02:14:08,164 --> 02:14:09,791
before his death

1474
02:14:10,500 --> 02:14:12,934
He's battling against death

1475
02:14:14,037 --> 02:14:16,471
Will each one of you...

1476
02:14:17,674 --> 02:14:23,977
please pray to God and dedicate
one minute of your lives to my dad?

1477
02:14:24,681 --> 02:14:26,649
This boy will ruin everything!

1478
02:14:28,118 --> 02:14:30,484
God cannot turn down
the prayers of millions

1479
02:14:33,957 --> 02:14:36,482
Just a minute will be taken
from your lives...

1480
02:14:37,060 --> 02:14:41,622
but it'll give my father
a precious lease of life

1481
02:14:42,966 --> 02:14:46,834
My father will be able to see
his grandson

1482
02:14:49,806 --> 02:14:53,105
You must be wondering why you must
give away a minute of your life...

1483
02:14:53,476 --> 02:14:55,444
just to make my father live

1484
02:14:57,647 --> 02:15:00,445
But if you look at your children
playing in your courtyards...

1485
02:15:00,650 --> 02:15:02,447
you'll probably find the answer

1486
02:15:06,055 --> 02:15:07,454
My daddy...

1487
02:15:09,926 --> 02:15:11,450
makes toys

1488
02:15:11,961 --> 02:15:14,930
A baby smiles on seeing the rattler
hung up on the cradle

1489
02:15:16,032 --> 02:15:18,466
My father designs the first smile
of the baby

1490
02:15:21,037 --> 02:15:25,474
The baby claps when
the monkey-toy jumps...

1491
02:15:26,509 --> 02:15:28,807
and he is upset when the monkey
falls to the ground

1492
02:15:30,580 --> 02:15:32,480
The mother then explains...

1493
02:15:34,184 --> 02:15:36,015
''Son, this is what life
is all about''

1494
02:15:37,287 --> 02:15:39,983
''So if you happen to fall,
don't be upset''

1495
02:15:41,057 --> 02:15:42,684
''Rise, and walk again''

1496
02:15:43,526 --> 02:15:45,153
My father designs some upbringing

1497
02:15:48,264 --> 02:15:52,428
ln this barbaric world,
my father fills babies with innocence

1498
02:15:54,003 --> 02:15:56,972
lf he has in some way helped
in the upbringing of your children...

1499
02:15:59,008 --> 02:16:02,444
then in return, please give him
a minute of your lives

1500
02:16:04,847 --> 02:16:07,441
Whether my father will be able to see
his grandson's face or not...

1501
02:16:10,053 --> 02:16:11,680
is in your hands

1502
02:16:14,958 --> 02:16:19,793
The hands that you have joined
before God...

1503
02:16:41,684 --> 02:16:42,651
Dad!

1504
02:16:48,858 --> 02:16:50,485
My darling!

1505
02:16:51,794 --> 02:16:54,763
You think only you can act?

1506
02:16:55,465 --> 02:16:59,424
l did some acting too somehow.
- l love you, dad

1507
02:16:59,969 --> 02:17:01,937
l love you

1508
02:17:03,006 --> 02:17:05,099
We've got our son back, Sumi

1509
02:17:06,643 --> 02:17:08,440
We've got our Adi back, Sumi

1510
02:17:10,480 --> 02:17:12,448
You don't look good
when you are crying

1511
02:17:12,815 --> 02:17:15,784
Wipe your tears
... here's the handkerchief

1512
02:17:16,686 --> 02:17:18,119
Wipe your tears

1513
02:17:18,488 --> 02:17:21,457
Handkerchief in your pocket?

1514
02:17:22,158 --> 02:17:24,956
Sumi, all my worries are over

1515
02:17:25,895 --> 02:17:27,795
Your son has become responsible

1516
02:17:28,998 --> 02:17:30,966
Pooja, look, my Adi...

1517
02:17:31,834 --> 02:17:33,461
who used to trouble everyone
until they cried...

1518
02:17:35,171 --> 02:17:35,967
has learnt to wipe my tears

1519
02:17:39,575 --> 02:17:40,542
Dada!

1520
02:17:41,678 --> 02:17:43,475
You have yet to see your grandson

1521
02:17:44,714 --> 02:17:47,979
l have challenged Time.
We can't lose

1522
02:17:48,718 --> 02:17:50,151
We have to win

1523
02:17:50,520 --> 02:17:53,751
l love you, dada.
- My son !

1524
02:17:57,627 --> 02:17:59,925
This... for my grandson...

1525
02:18:01,631 --> 02:18:03,428
my grandson

1526
02:19:45,168 --> 02:19:46,795
My son

1527
02:19:49,172 --> 02:19:50,730
My heir

1528
02:19:53,643 --> 02:19:56,578
Sumi, l've got my grandson

1529
02:20:03,453 --> 02:20:05,080
Dada, we've won

1530
02:20:06,789 --> 02:20:08,586
Everyone prayed for us

1531
02:20:09,158 --> 02:20:11,752
We've won, dada.
- No, son

1532
02:20:14,764 --> 02:20:16,425
You've won

1533
02:20:17,133 --> 02:20:23,094
You put your dreams at stake,
just to fulfill my dream

1534
02:20:24,140 --> 02:20:25,835
You won

1535
02:20:26,008 --> 02:20:27,976
The credit for our victory
goes to the people

1536
02:20:29,812 --> 02:20:31,780
They wholeheartedly prayed for us

1537
02:20:33,649 --> 02:20:35,617
Know what, dada?

1538
02:20:36,619 --> 02:20:39,782
Even today we have two sacks
full of letters at home

1539
02:20:41,691 --> 02:20:45,127
Two sacks! Two sacks full of letters
in a postman's house!

1540
02:20:46,796 --> 02:20:49,196
What do we call the baby, dad?

1541
02:20:49,832 --> 02:20:53,791
Hang on. There are still
some challenges left

1542
02:20:54,003 --> 02:20:55,971
Know what, dad? From now on,
Adi will concentrate...

1543
02:20:56,672 --> 02:20:58,139
only on his career in movies

1544
02:20:59,242 --> 02:21:01,642
l and Pooja will manage your factory

1545
02:21:04,180 --> 02:21:06,148
And what will happen to this...?

1546
02:21:10,686 --> 02:21:13,985
l promise you, everyday
l shall wear flowers in my hair...

1547
02:21:15,024 --> 02:21:17,993
apply a dot of sandalwood paste
on my forehead and go to office

1548
02:21:23,766 --> 02:21:24,824
Laxman...

1549
02:21:27,803 --> 02:21:29,998
come here.
Don't you have any questions today?

1550
02:21:33,743 --> 02:21:35,506
When will you return?

1551
02:21:45,655 --> 02:21:49,318
l will... l will return

1552
02:21:53,663 --> 02:21:55,460
As Adi's daughter

1553
02:21:59,035 --> 02:22:00,798
And we'll go to watch my movies

1554
02:22:01,504 --> 02:22:03,802
Hardly matters if people watch or not,
we'll go

1555
02:22:04,073 --> 02:22:09,978
No! l'll go to watch late night shows
with my boyfriend

1556
02:22:10,179 --> 02:22:13,478
But you must return home
before seven, else...

1557
02:22:14,684 --> 02:22:16,652
Get lost!
- Else, you'll see the worst of me

1558
02:22:18,187 --> 02:22:22,817
Get lost! After the show, l'll return
only after having dinner with him

1559
02:22:23,693 --> 02:22:27,993
Keep waiting for me,
lt's your turn now

1560
02:22:32,768 --> 02:22:34,497
lshu !

1561
02:22:35,671 --> 02:22:37,502
Pooja, apply the mark on him

1562
02:22:38,808 --> 02:22:40,503
lshwar, christen him

1563
02:22:41,143 --> 02:22:43,111
The grandfather will now christen
his grandson

1564
02:22:44,547 --> 02:22:46,845
ln sandalwood, the baby is bathed...

1565
02:22:47,216 --> 02:22:49,184
may joys abound in his life...

1566
02:22:50,019 --> 02:22:52,112
may the world bow at his feet

1567
02:22:52,888 --> 02:22:54,446
His grandfather christens him...

1568
02:22:54,657 --> 02:22:56,454
lshu, christen him

1569
02:22:58,494 --> 02:23:00,462
Name him

1570
02:23:04,266 --> 02:23:06,962
lshwar is his name
