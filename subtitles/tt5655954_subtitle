1
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:02,490
'Our Prime minister
Rajiv Gandhi...'

2
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:04,450
'...keeping village development in mind'

3
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:07,370
'...has announced procedures for
local elections in villages and districts'

4
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:11,570
'Local body elections as well as
municipal elections will be held'

5
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:13,690
'As informed by the Election Commissioner'

6
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:16,223
Whatever it is, Panchayat's family
will be elected as our village leader

7
00:01:16,248 --> 00:01:18,728
Who will even think of
contesting our Rajamanickam?

8
00:01:22,147 --> 00:01:23,467
What's in your mind, dear?

9
00:01:23,492 --> 00:01:24,317
Why are you hesitating?

10
00:01:24,342 --> 00:01:25,462
From our father's time...

11
00:01:25,566 --> 00:01:27,606
...someone from our family
is the village head

12
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:31,140
It seems an election will decide
the Panchayat head this time

13
00:01:31,165 --> 00:01:31,965
Yes

14
00:01:31,996 --> 00:01:37,356
My husband wanted me to ask you
if this time he can contest instead

15
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:44,170
Did I speak out of turn, brother?

16
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:45,770
Not at all, dear

17
00:01:50,132 --> 00:01:51,172
Kayavarnam

18
00:01:51,197 --> 00:01:52,957
Ask my brother-in-law to stand

19
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:56,250
Even if we were born
from the same womb...

20
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:58,121
...a brother wouldn't have
been so magnanimous!

21
00:01:58,146 --> 00:01:59,826
What are you saying, idiot?

22
00:02:00,235 --> 00:02:04,115
Though our mothers are different
we share the same father, right?

23
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:06,107
'You are asking me a favor
when you're pregnant'

24
00:02:06,132 --> 00:02:07,772
'How can I refuse you?'

25
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:12,890
Sir, you know very well
about your brother-in-law

26
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:14,610
The entire village also knows

27
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:16,610
5 villages are now grouped
into 1 Panchayat

28
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:19,490
If you stand in the election, no one
will have the guts to oppose you

29
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:21,170
But if your sister's husband stands...

30
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:23,770
...all 5 villages will contest
just for the heck of it

31
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:25,536
Votes will get split

32
00:02:25,561 --> 00:02:27,481
If our neighboring village wins...

33
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:30,330
...we will be under their mercy
if we need to mediate any issue

34
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:31,610
Think about it

35
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:34,810
He is also justified

36
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:37,810
You or your father did not ask
for this title as village head

37
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:39,810
This village conferred it on you

38
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:42,050
You're the only heir
to the Panchayat's family

39
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:43,916
If you yourself should feel
the hands should change...

40
00:02:43,941 --> 00:02:45,421
...I don't think it's right

41
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:49,010
I told my entire village
I am standing in this election

42
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:51,290
Now you come here and
ask me to step down

43
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:52,370
Is it fair?

44
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:54,170
I asked you
And you agreed

45
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:56,370
You knew the pros and cons
when you nodded your head

46
00:02:56,395 --> 00:02:57,595
It was wrong on my part

47
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:00,050
I couldn't say no
to my sister

48
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:01,930
If my entire village
is against it...

49
00:03:01,955 --> 00:03:03,075
...what can I do?

50
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:05,162
So more than your sister's life...

51
00:03:05,294 --> 00:03:07,094
...what the villagers feel
is important to you?

52
00:03:07,119 --> 00:03:08,039
Brother-in-law?

53
00:03:08,064 --> 00:03:09,224
Don't call me 'machan'

54
00:03:09,357 --> 00:03:10,957
Disgusting to hear it

55
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:12,622
Actually you are power-mad

56
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:14,948
And you are pretending
you care for your sister

57
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:17,850
Machan, listen to me

58
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:19,690
Only this village
is under your control

59
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:21,056
There are 4 more villages

60
00:03:21,081 --> 00:03:22,561
I will prove my clout to you

61
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:24,290
Machan...?

62
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:27,570
'Caste your vote
to 'spectacles' symbol

63
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:29,970
(canvassing for votes)

64
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:50,718
'In the local body elections
conducted recently...'

65
00:03:50,743 --> 00:03:53,663
'...candidate Rajamanickam has won
against his opponent Murugaiyan'

66
00:03:53,688 --> 00:03:56,048
'...with a margin of 600 votes'

67
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:34,850
'He made you a widow
He left you all alone'

68
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:42,370
(funeral lament song)

69
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:04,410
Stop it

70
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:06,010
STOP IT!

71
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:15,850
If only you had said 'no'
I wouldn't be a widow

72
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:19,130
You gave your word
when I came to your house

73
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:22,490
And now you've come here
to cremate my husband

74
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:24,810
Aren't you ashamed?

75
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:28,890
If I had been your real sister
would you have done this?

76
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:32,370
Your wish was fulfilled?

77
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:35,970
You made me a widow!

78
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:40,010
All because of your wavering mind
I am now alone with a baby to raise

79
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:43,770
I swear I'll bring you and your family
to the streets distraught and demented

80
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:46,890
Otherwise I'm an illegitimate child!

81
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:48,730
Go

82
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:51,730
GO AWAY

83
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:17,170
I've left, pa

84
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,410
Come, pa

85
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:20,050
I've come out now

86
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:23,170
I'll be back

87
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,810
He is really upset
we'll drift apart

88
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:38,090
I won't feel bad it is
our last day of college life

89
00:06:38,115 --> 00:06:39,635
I swear!

90
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:40,700
Get off me, please

91
00:06:40,725 --> 00:06:41,885
I swear I won't

92
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:44,030
If you feel too much
your intestines will hang out

93
00:06:44,055 --> 00:06:45,655
Saravana...your girl

94
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:48,010
She is here

95
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:50,010
Get off me

96
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:53,210
Move...get off my back

97
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:54,850
Hi Shuba

98
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:04,610
Look at me

99
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:07,890
Shuba, what happened?

100
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:10,330
Tell me what's wrong

101
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:11,850
Will we meet again?

102
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:13,410
Or is this goodbye?

103
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:14,890
I am so tense

104
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:16,250
Nutcase!

105
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:17,730
Why do you feel this way?

106
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,210
What's gone wrong?

107
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:20,930
Sorry, da

108
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:25,250
Looks like your girl
is very upset

109
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:26,282
Shall we start our treatment?

110
00:07:26,307 --> 00:07:27,067
Get lost!

111
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:28,490
Okay, enjoy

112
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:31,170
Don't get perturbed
for no reason

113
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:34,032
First go home and ask your people
to come and meet my family formally

114
00:07:34,057 --> 00:07:35,617
Only when my brother gets married...

115
00:07:35,642 --> 00:07:37,202
...I can even broach this topic

116
00:07:37,434 --> 00:07:39,594
When will your brother
ever get married?

117
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:42,130
They will dump me
on someone else by then

118
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:47,650
Then you can end up...

119
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:51,170
...only as my mistress!

120
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:55,010
Scumbag!
Get lost

121
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:56,770
Here I am sharing my worry

122
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:59,130
I have full faith
in my brother

123
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:25,930
"Let's begin with our feet tapping
Don't stand aloof, just join in"

124
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:31,490
"Time will not rise to the bait
for you to lock your life and wait"

125
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:39,450
"Let's start with our hands clapping
Don't stand alone, just join in"

126
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:43,970
"Time will not let you lock
or turn back the clock"

127
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:48,570
"Look at the blue cerulean sky
The cottony clouds fleet and fly"

128
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:53,050
"Clouds can't be tied down
or clamped to the ground"

129
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:57,650
"Go and find your goal
Find your quest, heart and soul"

130
00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:03,330
"Whatever happens, let it be
Let's cross the bridge eventually"

131
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:42,610
"Life's mooring may you find
without wasting your time"

132
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:46,399
"Even a blade of grass is a peak too
Ask a small ant, it will tell you"

133
00:09:46,602 --> 00:09:51,122
"The present, like clouds fluffy
will disappear in a jiffy"

134
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:55,930
"The future, like the sky azure
will expand crystal clear"

135
00:09:55,970 --> 00:10:00,450
"You should not despair
of your life however"

136
00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:05,315
"In front of our eyes, time will fly
Don't sleep and regret how or why"

137
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:10,060
"Bowl to beg is made of tortoise shell
but it will never be used by the turtle"

138
00:10:10,085 --> 00:10:14,205
"Let's begin with our feet tapping
Don't be detached, just join in"

139
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:19,710
"Time will not let you lock
or turn back the clock"

140
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:08,450
"Don't be disheartened at any cost
Your confidence won't be lost"

141
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:12,730
"No bird will be bugged daily
to search for its prey diligently"

142
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:17,170
"Creases in womb when fingers closed
become lines in our palm imposed"

143
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:21,730
"More cherished than the palm line
is sweat our hard work can determine"

144
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:26,290
"Life teaches us as we grow
lessons so precious you know"

145
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:31,170
"Before your youth gets worn out
path stretches ahead, run, sprint"

146
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:35,970
"No pain no gain you know
Is the maxim to follow"

147
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:40,170
"Let's start with our hands clapping
Don't stand alone, just join in"

148
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:45,250
"Time will not rise to the bait
for you to lock your life and wait"

149
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:01,210
Junior

150
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:14,450
Move aside

151
00:12:17,182 --> 00:12:18,450
- Junior?
- Yes, father?

152
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:19,930
What do you intend doing next?

153
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:21,170
Chartered accountancy

154
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:23,177
At least you study and prove
a teacher's son is not a nitwit

155
00:12:23,202 --> 00:12:24,362
That will make me feel proud

156
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:28,090
Otherwise if I call myself a teacher
quite a few people will ridicule me

157
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:30,530
Even if I didn't study
I'm also a teacher

158
00:12:34,152 --> 00:12:36,872
He nurtures his students with lessons

159
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:40,450
I nourish my grains with
fertilizers and nurse them

160
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:42,970
Am I not a teacher too?

161
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:44,690
Of course

162
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:46,010
Tell him

163
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:49,850
I've seen plenty of
this kind of play on words

164
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:51,442
They are all roaming around jobless

165
00:12:51,467 --> 00:12:54,427
He will be a sensitive man, only if
you add enough salt when you cook rice

166
00:12:54,452 --> 00:12:55,732
I have enough of it

167
00:12:55,757 --> 00:12:57,757
Dump it on people
who are thick-skinned

168
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:01,130
Listen

169
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:04,086
Short temper is his forte

170
00:13:04,111 --> 00:13:06,391
Why haven't you eaten?

171
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:08,370
Vetri, he has walked off in a huff

172
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:10,001
Not to worry, he'll go
upto the porch and back

173
00:13:10,026 --> 00:13:11,601
You go on this 'tit for tat' spree

174
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:12,868
What do you want me to do?

175
00:13:12,893 --> 00:13:14,253
He wanted me to study

176
00:13:14,278 --> 00:13:15,678
What is the use
of just wishing?

177
00:13:15,725 --> 00:13:18,005
Our astrologer Subramani
told us long ago

178
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:21,270
Even if Saraswathy, Goddess of knowledge
teaches you better than your father...

179
00:13:21,295 --> 00:13:22,415
...it won't enter your skull

180
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,960
So what do you infer from this?

181
00:13:24,123 --> 00:13:25,443
You never told me this!

182
00:13:25,468 --> 00:13:27,908
Education and I are
as far as Pluto from Earth!

183
00:13:28,114 --> 00:13:29,154
Indeed

184
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:32,275
It isn't as if academics alone
can decide a man's intelligence

185
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,300
You know the difference

186
00:13:33,325 --> 00:13:34,965
Senior, you are an entrepreneur

187
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:36,310
Even you know the difference

188
00:13:36,335 --> 00:13:37,815
But some creatures-

189
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:40,130
He wants 2 'dosas' it seems

190
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:54,130
If this man goes to buy vegetables
this will only be the outcome

191
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:56,410
Either stale or shriveled

192
00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:58,843
The vendors know he can
be duped as soon as they see him

193
00:13:58,868 --> 00:14:00,068
Ma...?

194
00:14:00,093 --> 00:14:01,093
Where is my brother?

195
00:14:01,118 --> 00:14:02,598
He left early in the morning

196
00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:03,989
So early...where?

197
00:14:04,029 --> 00:14:05,029
To the shop

198
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:09,730
Even your father takes his own sweet time
and goes to school only at 9:00 a.m

199
00:14:09,755 --> 00:14:12,995
But he will leave
at the stroke of 6

200
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:15,210
'Work is worship' for him

201
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:17,837
He seems to be going
overboard on his worship

202
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:20,450
What can you see
in my horoscope?

203
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:26,810
'I can see everything'

204
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:28,570
What is in store for me?

205
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:30,090
Your horoscope
shows no hope

206
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:31,290
No hope at all

207
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:32,210
Yes, man

208
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:35,650
Malefic effects of Saturn is sitting
in your house and listening to a folk song

209
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:36,890
Folk song?

210
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:38,050
Yes

211
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:39,690
You mean it has entered my life?

212
00:14:39,715 --> 00:14:41,990
Saturn thinks you are
living with it already

213
00:14:42,015 --> 00:14:43,895
What's wrong with these 'planets'?

214
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:47,680
When there are so many houses
to enter, why choose only mine?

215
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:49,930
Only Saturn, huh?

216
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:53,250
From the 3rd house
planet Rahu is peeping in

217
00:14:55,396 --> 00:14:56,316
You were bang on

218
00:14:56,341 --> 00:14:57,381
His name is not Rahu

219
00:14:57,406 --> 00:14:58,366
His name is Raghu!

220
00:14:58,391 --> 00:14:59,271
Don't look at him

221
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:00,610
He's already looking at us

222
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:01,490
Look at me

223
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:03,250
How is my wife?

224
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:07,170
If you are the driver of a rented car
will you say 'no' to any passenger?

225
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:08,610
He turns them down

226
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:10,490
He wakes up a driver
sleeping next to him

227
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:13,170
Sends him instead and
keeps ogling and drooling

228
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:17,250
How will he go?

229
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:19,450
Too many lines make
a scowl on his forehead!

230
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:20,675
It's against destiny, no?

231
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:21,780
Why not?

232
00:15:21,805 --> 00:15:23,805
Sun is peeping
from the 5th house

233
00:15:23,853 --> 00:15:31,253
"Half saree with flowers printed
dances delightfully intoxicated"

234
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:32,730
I didn't know his name is Sun

235
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:34,090
I don't know him from Adam

236
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:35,930
I don't even know
where he is from

237
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:37,730
But he wakes up and
makes a beeline here

238
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,402
He wears jazzy shirts
Each day a new color

239
00:15:39,427 --> 00:15:41,827
And ogles at her
with intense ardor

240
00:15:41,852 --> 00:15:44,612
"My princess"

241
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:51,210
Even Jupiter, that is, Guru in Tamil
is looking from the 9th house

242
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:55,890
You're a hopeless astrologer
His full name is Gurumurthy

243
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:56,850
Look at him

244
00:15:56,905 --> 00:15:59,985
He looks like a piece of firewood
swept in a flood, strong and sturdy

245
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:02,690
Kneading that dough, he is
showing off his Cupid-antics

246
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:05,330
I am being saved
by sheer God's grace

247
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:07,770
You seem to be in a real soup

248
00:16:08,082 --> 00:16:12,602
I miscalculated that a young wife
will take good care of me in my old age

249
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:16,130
I spent all the money I earned
and performed a grand wedding

250
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:19,250
But these jobless jerks
not spending a single paisa...

251
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:22,570
...are dying to have a ball with her

252
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:25,530
How do I prevent them
from achieving their goal?

253
00:16:26,051 --> 00:16:27,211
I have a solution

254
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:29,431
If Moon, that is, Chandran in Tamil
stays in your own house...

255
00:16:29,456 --> 00:16:30,856
...all your problems will be solved

256
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:33,290
Thank God!
When will he come?

257
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:34,930
He is ready right now

258
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:36,050
I don't get it

259
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:37,410
I am Chandran

260
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:38,890
Jayachandran

261
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:40,400
The moment you give
the green signal...

262
00:16:40,425 --> 00:16:42,960
...I can gladly perform
the 'house warming' ceremony

263
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:44,610
When shall I move in?

264
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:46,930
Right now?

265
00:16:52,225 --> 00:16:54,065
There are already 3 jerks
ogling at my wife

266
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:54,949
Are you making a foursome!

267
00:16:54,974 --> 00:16:56,174
I just wanted to protect you

268
00:16:56,243 --> 00:16:58,803
Does a country egg need
a snake as security guard?!

269
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:00,816
Good at making up proverbs

270
00:17:00,841 --> 00:17:02,881
When it comes to making out
you are really bad!

271
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:04,930
Othaasai

272
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:06,090
Did you see Vetri?

273
00:17:06,215 --> 00:17:07,455
Vetri-

274
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,320
Where has he gone?

275
00:17:08,345 --> 00:17:09,625
Must have gone to learn

276
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:10,610
Learn what?

277
00:17:11,242 --> 00:17:14,802
Even if he is like king Karna
in giving whatever anyone asks...

278
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:17,530
...in learning, he is the disciple
of the learned Abdul Kalam

279
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:19,490
Which seed to plough where?

280
00:17:19,545 --> 00:17:21,570
Which fertilizer for which seedling?

281
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:25,330
He keeps learning more tips
in the job he loves wholeheartedly

282
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:27,530
Like father, like son!

283
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:44,810
Let me ask you upfront

284
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:47,490
What's happening? You look
so different from your usual self

285
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:48,890
You mean my attire?

286
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:50,084
I went regarding
that farmland in Tanjor-

287
00:17:50,205 --> 00:17:51,005
Stop right there

288
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:52,772
Othaasai already told me a story

289
00:17:52,797 --> 00:17:54,837
You don't come up with a new one
and waste my time

290
00:17:54,862 --> 00:17:55,982
Tell me the truth

291
00:17:58,370 --> 00:17:59,810
It's a small accident

292
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:00,890
Accident?

293
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:03,010
You are travelling in a bus

294
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:04,890
Someone stamps your foot
in the crowded bus

295
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:05,872
What will you do?

296
00:18:05,897 --> 00:18:08,017
I'll hit him
till his ears ring!

297
00:18:08,156 --> 00:18:09,516
But I couldn't react like that

298
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:10,581
Why?

299
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:13,930
Because-

300
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:24,330
Sorry, I didn't see

301
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:25,530
What happened?

302
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:27,050
I stamped his foot

303
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:29,530
Sorry

304
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:32,370
Hasn't she apologized
to you repeatedly?

305
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:34,170
Then why are you
staring daggers at her?

306
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:36,770
Am I staring?
Blind or what?

307
00:18:36,917 --> 00:18:37,793
I didn't have space

308
00:18:37,818 --> 00:18:39,332
So I accidentally
stamped on your foot

309
00:18:39,357 --> 00:18:40,317
It doesn't hurt

310
00:18:40,401 --> 00:18:41,601
I didn't know

311
00:18:41,626 --> 00:18:43,586
I swear on my mother

312
00:18:43,836 --> 00:18:45,636
Stamp my foot again
It won't pain

313
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:46,970
Come on, stamp

314
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:48,810
Please stamp on my foot again

315
00:18:51,145 --> 00:18:55,465
She stamped on my foot
and imprinted love in my heart

316
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:57,730
Vetri, am I hearing you right?

317
00:18:57,770 --> 00:18:58,850
Poetry

318
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:00,500
Love, my dear bro

319
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:01,940
It entered my body, mind and soul

320
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:02,770
Then...?

321
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,499
Then within an hour
I changed myself

322
00:19:04,524 --> 00:19:06,364
I stood before her in a new avatar!

323
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:14,305
I must give this sand for testing

324
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:15,890
- Can I go in?
- Sure

325
00:19:35,004 --> 00:19:36,450
Don't you remember me?

326
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:39,530
Bus, foot, sorry

327
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:42,970
Oh! I already apologized to you

328
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:46,330
Sand...research

329
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:49,883
If you go straight and turn left
you'll reach a 'counter'

330
00:19:49,908 --> 00:19:52,108
Give it in that department

331
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:53,690
'Gounder' as in caste...?

332
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:56,970
Madam...madam

333
00:19:57,010 --> 00:19:57,890
Please stop

334
00:19:57,985 --> 00:19:59,231
Which department are you in?

335
00:19:59,256 --> 00:19:59,976
Hello

336
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:02,970
Do you want details
about the sand or me?

337
00:20:06,665 --> 00:20:09,505
In my town, 100 acres of land
has been scorched and destroyed

338
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:12,410
To salvage it, I was helpless
and didn't know whom to meet

339
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:15,290
I heaved a huge sigh of relief
after meeting you

340
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:18,090
Okay

341
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:20,650
If you have any doubts
ask at the front desk

342
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:21,970
They will help you

343
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:23,770
Front desk...?

344
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:29,690
When I talk, you no middle talk!

345
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:32,410
I tell HOD

346
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:36,450
- Hey! Jaggery-head
- Vetri anna?

347
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:37,610
Just a minute

348
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:39,490
All boys get out of the class

349
00:20:40,138 --> 00:20:41,090
Get out of the class

350
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:42,210
How is it you are here?

351
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:43,970
I work as lab attendant here

352
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:45,970
But what is this new disguise?

353
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:47,010
Hey...!

354
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:50,170
As if love at first sight is possible
if someone stamps your foot!

355
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:55,566
I didn't mean that

356
00:20:55,698 --> 00:20:59,938
Life will be happier if you don't
fall in love or get married

357
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:01,105
Look at me

358
00:21:01,149 --> 00:21:02,530
How happy I am

359
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:06,970
You won't listen to me

360
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:09,170
But that madam is
very well educated

361
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:11,730
You can't hold a candle
to her education

362
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:15,730
I think you've already
made up your mind

363
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:19,490
She's a research scholar
in organic farming

364
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:22,290
Ecological farming

365
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:25,170
No one can meet her that easily

366
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:28,010
Only fertilizer shop owners will meet
her regularly and take her advice

367
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:30,290
I'm sure you started
a fertilizer shop the next week

368
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:32,210
The very next day!

369
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:34,010
- Show them that too
- Okay, I will

370
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:35,970
Good morning, madam

371
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:37,650
Madam...madam...madam

372
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:41,090
- What do you want?
- I've started a new fertilizer shop

373
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:45,850
I knew you won't believe me
So I've brought photos of my shop

374
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:47,130
Please walk a little slower

375
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:49,770
Rented a shop yesterday,
purchased fertilizers yesterday

376
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:51,010
And opened it yesterday too

377
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:52,730
Got the license also, madam

378
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:58,370
Only you and I can
save my village soil

379
00:21:58,410 --> 00:21:59,890
That's why I took
this sudden decision

380
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:02,450
Hey Janani,
ma'am wants you

381
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:05,490
Janani...?

382
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:09,330
"Janani, Janani
You are my world, in harmony"

383
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:11,050
Is it your ringtone now?

384
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:12,410
Things we do for love!

385
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:16,330
Othaasai has the keys
Open the shop

386
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:19,110
- What happened then?
- What happened, huh?

387
00:22:19,235 --> 00:22:21,275
She made me sit and
spoke pages and pages!

388
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:24,770
Any crop needs
16 types of nutrients

389
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:27,810
Urea, potassium that you sprinkle

390
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:33,250
Potassium, how much
ever you sprinkle...

391
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:34,990
...will provide only 3 nutrients

392
00:22:35,015 --> 00:22:37,735
But Vernicompost is completely
different from this

393
00:22:39,912 --> 00:22:41,410
Earthworm waste

394
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:44,010
- Earthworm, I know it very well
- That's right, okay

395
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:47,490
It will provide all 16 nutrients-

396
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:08,650
Is that all?

397
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:09,970
Listen, sir

398
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:11,730
I've shared all that I have learnt

399
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:12,589
Try to think

400
00:23:12,614 --> 00:23:13,974
Maybe you forgot something

401
00:23:14,022 --> 00:23:18,222
From all that I said, you can do
a green revolution in your town!

402
00:23:18,702 --> 00:23:20,102
Enough, please

403
00:23:20,127 --> 00:23:22,247
You exhausted your quota

404
00:23:22,272 --> 00:23:24,912
You would've immediately taken
useless Othaasai along, right?

405
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:27,290
You catch on
as quick as camphor!

406
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:29,850
But do you know
how I took him?

407
00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:42,589
Did anyone make you lie
on your stomach and iron you?

408
00:23:42,614 --> 00:23:45,094
- You told me to be stiff
- Stiff like this?!

409
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:47,890
How dare you raise your hand?

410
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:49,410
I don't need your friendship

411
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:50,250
Leave me out

412
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:51,370
Please...please...please

413
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:52,490
Don't go

414
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:54,170
Can you touch a landlord?

415
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:55,170
Take your hands off me

416
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:56,650
Please don't bring the roof down

417
00:23:56,690 --> 00:23:57,730
Step back

418
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:01,690
I'm here to help you

419
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:03,250
Not the other way around

420
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:04,570
Get that into your head?

421
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:08,130
If you bring someone
to assist you...

422
00:24:08,170 --> 00:24:09,090
...you must soft pedal

423
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:09,930
Don't shout

424
00:24:09,955 --> 00:24:10,955
He's ignoring a landlord!

425
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:11,860
Sorry

426
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:16,130
Sir is the most influential
zamindar from my village

427
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:17,880
I explained to him verbatim
what you told me

428
00:24:17,905 --> 00:24:19,305
But I believe he didn't get it

429
00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:21,890
If you brief him,
it will be awesome

430
00:24:21,915 --> 00:24:22,955
What...?

431
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:25,650
For sir to cultivate groundnut
in 200 acres of land

432
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,640
200...?

433
00:24:26,665 --> 00:24:27,825
Don't get flustered, sir

434
00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:29,641
We'll check later about
the 300 acres in the north

435
00:24:29,666 --> 00:24:30,880
300...?

436
00:24:31,052 --> 00:24:34,132
Don't try to stuff it all
at the same time

437
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:38,730
Let's find out how
to cultivate peanuts

438
00:24:40,575 --> 00:24:42,735
How can I grow peanuts?

439
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,160
Please explain

440
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:47,450
If you explain to me,
I'll tell him clearly

441
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:50,370
Meenakshi madam,
your blouse is ready

442
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:52,514
You can collect it this evening
along with your sample blouse

443
00:24:52,539 --> 00:24:54,699
Don't spoil my business
That lady owes me 40 bucks

444
00:24:54,724 --> 00:24:56,124
Will you go to
a different shop?

445
00:24:56,388 --> 00:24:57,308
What...?

446
00:24:57,450 --> 00:24:59,370
This is zamindar speaking

447
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:01,890
- What's my name?
- That's very important now

448
00:25:01,915 --> 00:25:03,555
I'm a very important landlord here

449
00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:04,810
Listen to me

450
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:06,850
I'm 300 acre landlord here

451
00:25:07,431 --> 00:25:08,911
300+200

452
00:25:08,936 --> 00:25:11,256
- Blown it
- 500 acre zamindar speaking!

453
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:42,730
"Hey girl! I lose myself completely
Looking at you continuously"

454
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:48,090
"Unconditionally"

455
00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:53,650
"This whole 6 feet of me
bent backwards totally"

456
00:25:56,330 --> 00:26:00,930
"Your scent besieges my senses daily"

457
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:06,890
"Like a mad elephant it assaults me"

458
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:12,610
"Love, your inviting side glance
twirls a wheel in my heart at once"

459
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:30,450
"Hey lass! I liquefy headily
Looking at you steadily"

460
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:32,730
"Beautifully"

461
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:38,010
"This whole 6 feet of me
surrendered to you totally"

462
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:01,530
Good morning, madam

463
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:09,290
Good lord!

464
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:14,570
"With your love, why do you feed me
till I choke and cough endlessly?"

465
00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:19,770
"With your eyes expressive
you lasso a rope so possessive"

466
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:25,050
"With your torso addictive
you hit on me excessive"

467
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:30,130
"Not moving even a nano-second
you kindle a fire within so constant"

468
00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:35,250
"I see you wherever I go daily
Like a spirit, your image haunts me"

469
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:37,930
"You grabbed me forever
Nailed my heart in your favor"

470
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:45,970
"Hey lass! I yield totally
Looking at you untiringly"

471
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:09,570
Watch out!
You might fall

472
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:18,090
"When I think of you
I get bold and brazen too"

473
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:23,130
"I am like a lamp's wick
I turn into dawn double quick"

474
00:28:23,249 --> 00:28:26,169
"Though I can talk 19 to the dozen
you make me speechless 24x7"

475
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:28,490
- Why don't you eat with me?
- With pleasure

476
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:31,650
'Adiboli'

477
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,200
- It's 'adipoli'...fantastic!
- Oh! Is that so?

478
00:28:34,225 --> 00:28:38,905
"Inflicted in my mind somehow
On the whole like a mother's love"

479
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:41,570
"You are mine alluringly
Why did you disturb me?"

480
00:28:41,617 --> 00:28:43,737
"Hey my love-ly!"

481
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:49,490
"I relent readily
Looking at you steadily"

482
00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:53,930
"In your favor"

483
00:28:54,010 --> 00:29:00,130
"This 6 feet of me forever
fell for you hook, line and sinker"

484
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:07,250
"Your scent besieges my senses daily"

485
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:12,690
"Like a mad elephant it makes me dizzy"

486
00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:18,530
"Love, your inviting side glance
whirls a wheel in my heart at once"

487
00:29:38,050 --> 00:29:40,530
'I am stuck between
a rock and a hard place'

488
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:45,330
'I want to bare my soul to you
And then I hesitate!'

489
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:47,730
'I feel like spending
the rest of my life with you'

490
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:56,170
You could've sent her
that message, right?

491
00:29:57,930 --> 00:29:59,850
Missed a golden opportunity, Vetri

492
00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:05,210
You're both getting along fine now
Then what's the problem?

493
00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:09,090
Started with soil and fertilizer
and went up to chatting in Malayalam

494
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:10,810
When it comes to revealing
what's in my heart-

495
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:11,610
Stop

496
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:13,050
Which century are you in?

497
00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:15,790
If you like a girl, all you got
to do is propose and keep moving

498
00:30:15,815 --> 00:30:17,295
What's all this?

499
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:19,530
Okay, I'll profess my love

500
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:22,170
But what if she denies
feeling the same way?

501
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:25,697
How can you not
tell her how you feel?

502
00:30:25,722 --> 00:30:27,362
For how long?

503
00:30:27,387 --> 00:30:29,067
I don't know

504
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:32,490
I've lived an entire life with her
in these few days I've known her

505
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:35,970
I've built a temple in my heart
I don't wish to destroy it

506
00:30:37,530 --> 00:30:39,850
I'll be happy even if
I continue like this

507
00:30:40,370 --> 00:30:41,650
Okay, come

508
00:30:43,730 --> 00:30:45,770
- I want to meet her
- For what?

509
00:30:46,622 --> 00:30:47,862
She is my sister-in-law

510
00:30:47,887 --> 00:30:49,745
She will be the eldest
daughter-in-law of our house

511
00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:51,530
As your brother
shouldn't I meet her?

512
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:52,863
Then what, Vetri?

513
00:30:52,888 --> 00:30:55,448
She isn't expressing her feelings
and you aren't planning to either

514
00:30:55,473 --> 00:30:57,473
Give me your phone
I'll talk to her myself

515
00:30:57,611 --> 00:30:58,931
It can't be done
all of a sudden

516
00:30:58,956 --> 00:31:00,876
It will happen
all in good time

517
00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:03,410
Until then I'll continue to love

518
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:04,490
In your dreams!

519
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:06,210
To think I had full faith in you

520
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:07,570
My love is gone

521
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:09,330
Everything is gone with the wind!

522
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:12,618
Are you also in love?
Congratulations!

523
00:31:12,803 --> 00:31:13,643
Shut up

524
00:31:13,770 --> 00:31:16,490
Do you know how happy I was
when you said you are in love?

525
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:19,930
I thought I'll combine my love
with yours as 1 package at home!

526
00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:21,250
You let me down

527
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:23,370
Is she your classmate?

528
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:25,637
At least have you
expressed your love?

529
00:31:25,692 --> 00:31:26,972
As if I'll be like you!

530
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:28,690
I did all that
a long time ago

531
00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:30,170
She's very strong

532
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:31,890
Okay, forget that

533
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:33,690
Where is she from?

534
00:31:33,745 --> 00:31:35,845
Wanting to meet her right now
is asking for too much

535
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:37,030
Why shouldn't I meet her?

536
00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:38,250
Why not?

537
00:31:38,290 --> 00:31:39,570
Why should you?

538
00:31:40,173 --> 00:31:42,314
She is my sister-in-law

539
00:31:42,339 --> 00:31:44,139
She is the daughter-in-law of our house

540
00:31:44,164 --> 00:31:46,244
As your brother
shouldn't I meet her?

541
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:47,570
Hear me out

542
00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:50,490
If you meet her and some problem
crops up, the entire town will gang up

543
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:51,810
Do you know who her father is?

544
00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:52,850
Our President

545
00:31:52,890 --> 00:31:54,290
He's only the village-head

546
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:55,970
Not president of India, right?

547
00:31:56,010 --> 00:31:57,090
Vetri anna

548
00:31:57,490 --> 00:31:58,530
What, my dear boys?

549
00:31:58,570 --> 00:31:59,890
We are organizing
a cricket match

550
00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:02,050
Last year you came
before the game started

551
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:04,130
You've come with
a pamphlet this year

552
00:32:04,170 --> 00:32:05,570
Did some sponsor
fall into your trap?

553
00:32:05,610 --> 00:32:06,850
How can you say this, bro?

554
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:09,770
So sure you'll agree, we took the liberty
of naming you as our sponsor

555
00:32:09,810 --> 00:32:11,770
In the end you are making me
fall into your trap!

556
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:14,090
Only next month, right?
Come and collect it tomorrow

557
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:15,410
Bye brother

558
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:19,050
I've opened my shop
but no sign of a cup of tea

559
00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:23,130
- Bro, how about a cup of tea?
- Not in the mood for it

560
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:26,449
To sip a glass of tea, do you
need to be in the right mood?

561
00:32:26,474 --> 00:32:27,554
I'm not so finicky

562
00:32:27,653 --> 00:32:29,493
I don't believe in that word!

563
00:32:29,563 --> 00:32:31,003
'Even if you do
nothing happens!'

564
00:32:31,246 --> 00:32:32,846
Idiot! Blabbers all the time

565
00:32:32,930 --> 00:32:34,370
At least can you buy me tea?

566
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:35,930
Be quiet, Othaasai
I'm not in the mood either

567
00:32:36,031 --> 00:32:36,951
'You too?'

568
00:32:36,976 --> 00:32:38,336
You asked for tea, right?

569
00:32:38,610 --> 00:32:39,781
Shall we drink tea?

570
00:32:39,806 --> 00:32:41,366
He is in the tea-mood now

571
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,657
Vaadamalli, get my shirt, quick

572
00:32:42,682 --> 00:32:44,282
Before his mood changes!

573
00:32:44,307 --> 00:32:45,507
Where are you going?

574
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,320
Murthy will come now
He'll open the shop

575
00:32:47,399 --> 00:32:48,478
You keep an eye
We'll go drink tea

576
00:32:48,503 --> 00:32:49,983
Vaadamalli, don't bother making tea

577
00:32:50,167 --> 00:32:52,127
I'll go to the nearest tea-stall

578
00:32:55,290 --> 00:32:57,090
- Shall we go?
- Sure

579
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:00,610
Gawd! These lazy louts

580
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:02,703
When the cat's away
these rowdy rats will play!

581
00:33:02,728 --> 00:33:03,583
Please stop

582
00:33:03,608 --> 00:33:04,688
What's wrong with you?

583
00:33:04,713 --> 00:33:06,393
You gave me the shirt

584
00:33:06,418 --> 00:33:07,618
But did you get the key?

585
00:33:07,643 --> 00:33:09,203
Come in...come in

586
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:15,860
Just because I asked you to buy me tea
why are you taking me for a ride?!

587
00:33:15,885 --> 00:33:17,325
Do you see that town over there?

588
00:33:17,490 --> 00:33:19,050
Tea is damn good there it seems

589
00:33:19,075 --> 00:33:20,955
You drink that tea and
come back after 2 days

590
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:21,740
Let me get down

591
00:33:21,765 --> 00:33:22,885
Will you zip your lips?

592
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:24,950
Past 4 years
I've zipped my lips!

593
00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:28,250
What are you saying?

594
00:33:31,330 --> 00:33:33,130
That's why those louts
are ogling at her!

595
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:35,690
Now you got it,
drop me back home

596
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:37,756
- If I drop you?
- I'll be the savior!

597
00:33:37,781 --> 00:33:38,421
And then...?

598
00:33:38,446 --> 00:33:39,686
Don't keep asking questions

599
00:33:39,711 --> 00:33:41,991
Will you zip your lips?!

600
00:33:42,162 --> 00:33:44,802
I've never been
to this tea stall

601
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:47,330
Is there a tea shop
in this huge bungalow?

602
00:33:47,410 --> 00:33:49,930
How do they manage
to pay the rent?

603
00:33:50,410 --> 00:33:52,890
It's too crowded, let's go
to some other tea stall

604
00:33:52,915 --> 00:33:55,195
We didn't come here to drink tea

605
00:33:55,290 --> 00:33:56,890
We are 'seeing' a girl

606
00:33:57,130 --> 00:33:58,290
Check out a girl?

607
00:33:58,330 --> 00:34:00,810
My brother has fallen in love
with the girl who lives here

608
00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:03,050
So I wanted to
know more about her

609
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:05,124
At least today
behave like a big shot

610
00:34:05,149 --> 00:34:06,389
When did I claim that?

611
00:34:06,452 --> 00:34:08,012
Please drop me back home

612
00:34:08,037 --> 00:34:10,437
You'll anyway sit at home
with your lips zipped!

613
00:34:10,850 --> 00:34:14,050
'Aiyo! Don't hit me'

614
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:16,210
'Leave me, sir'

615
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:17,690
'It hurts'

616
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:19,930
'I won't do this again'

617
00:34:21,410 --> 00:34:24,610
I hear a lot of raised voices
Has someone passed away?

618
00:34:24,650 --> 00:34:27,250
Not yet, might happen soon!

619
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:29,031
Why is he saying this?

620
00:34:29,056 --> 00:34:31,856
Boys from the next village teased
our girls traveling by bus

621
00:34:31,881 --> 00:34:34,561
That's why our President
is beating them up black and blue

622
00:34:36,292 --> 00:34:38,212
Where did he go?
He won't stay in one place

623
00:34:38,237 --> 00:34:39,237
Oh! He is here

624
00:34:39,262 --> 00:34:41,982
Some stranger ogled
at his daughter!

625
00:34:42,007 --> 00:34:43,767
And this man is
beating him to a pulp

626
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:46,311
You are walking into the lion's den
to check out his daughter

627
00:34:46,336 --> 00:34:48,136
If he gets to know this
you'll be dead meat!

628
00:34:48,161 --> 00:34:49,361
Don't be silly

629
00:34:50,170 --> 00:34:51,405
- Please be scared
- I can't

630
00:34:51,430 --> 00:34:52,830
Please fear the unknown

631
00:34:52,855 --> 00:34:54,375
Whom do you want to meet?

632
00:34:55,304 --> 00:34:56,824
President of this village

633
00:34:56,849 --> 00:34:58,129
That's my husband

634
00:34:58,410 --> 00:35:01,410
Please wait
He is busy right now

635
00:35:01,930 --> 00:35:03,410
'Bloody scumbags!'

636
00:35:03,705 --> 00:35:06,145
How dare you tease our girls?

637
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:07,514
- Get up
- Forgive us, sir

638
00:35:07,539 --> 00:35:11,379
If you make fun of our girls,
I'll bury you alive, beware!

639
00:35:16,305 --> 00:35:18,665
Why invite me for all this?

640
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:20,506
We celebrate it
in a small way usually

641
00:35:20,531 --> 00:35:23,851
But this year we wanted to
invite a bigwig as chief guest

642
00:35:24,053 --> 00:35:27,050
All the 32 villages
suggested your name

643
00:35:27,850 --> 00:35:29,610
Is that what they said?

644
00:35:29,650 --> 00:35:30,505
'That's what they say'

645
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:32,450
I'm not a big shot at all

646
00:35:32,658 --> 00:35:34,458
I do my best

647
00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:36,046
Would you like
to drink something?

648
00:35:36,071 --> 00:35:36,911
Nothing for me

649
00:35:37,149 --> 00:35:39,189
But he loves drinking tea

650
00:35:39,214 --> 00:35:40,374
Bring 2 cups of tea, dear

651
00:35:40,399 --> 00:35:42,359
'Look where you've brought me
for a cup of tea!'

652
00:35:42,384 --> 00:35:44,304
At least I'm getting it here, right?

653
00:35:45,370 --> 00:35:47,858
By the way, who's this
elderly gentleman?

654
00:35:47,948 --> 00:35:49,108
Othaasai

655
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:51,006
I can see he is here to help you

656
00:35:51,031 --> 00:35:52,111
But what's his name?

657
00:35:52,136 --> 00:35:54,016
True to his name
he is very helpful

658
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:55,610
His name is Othaasai

659
00:35:56,930 --> 00:35:58,810
Why is he memorizing my name?

660
00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:00,850
So that he doesn't forget you!

661
00:36:24,170 --> 00:36:25,650
Masala...masala tea

662
00:36:28,330 --> 00:36:30,970
- How is my brother's selection?
- Too good

663
00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:33,250
Tea in our house
always tastes good

664
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:35,183
Would you like 1 more glass?

665
00:36:35,208 --> 00:36:36,328
No, thank you, sir

666
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:38,884
You are stating the obvious
while he is oblivious to it!

667
00:36:38,909 --> 00:36:40,269
Zip your lips
and drink it up!

668
00:36:40,294 --> 00:36:41,334
Thanks

669
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:42,930
Tea is fantastic

670
00:36:43,010 --> 00:36:44,650
Okay, then-

671
00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:45,890
We'll take leave, sir

672
00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:46,690
Definitely

673
00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:47,880
Will you definitely come?

674
00:36:47,905 --> 00:36:49,105
For sure, Othaasai

675
00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:50,530
'My name is registered in his head'

676
00:36:50,810 --> 00:36:53,059
'In Manmatha year,
3rd week of May'

677
00:36:53,296 --> 00:36:57,256
'Arul, son of Kayavarnam
who resides in Naatuchalai village'

678
00:36:57,570 --> 00:37:01,130
'Latha, daughter of Mr Rangaiyan
residing in the same village'

679
00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:04,210
'Marriage is officially fixed
by the elders of both families'

680
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:07,730
'Uncles of the bride and groom,
please exchange the trousseau plates'

681
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:15,850
In spite of the family feud
does he give up his bond?

682
00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:17,410
That's why he's respected!

683
00:37:23,570 --> 00:37:24,770
Stop right there

684
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:26,730
Who invited you
with a golden platter?

685
00:37:26,755 --> 00:37:28,794
You lack propriety and
you're here as mere protocol

686
00:37:28,819 --> 00:37:30,419
Kayavarnam...!
How can you be rude-

687
00:37:30,444 --> 00:37:31,724
I resent him
with all my heart

688
00:37:31,823 --> 00:37:33,303
Please don't interfere

689
00:37:35,770 --> 00:37:37,402
You want to get into
the good books of the villagers?

690
00:37:37,427 --> 00:37:40,227
Or to ask me to keep
your daughter as mistress?

691
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:44,290
You waited all these years to ask
if your daughter can marry my son?

692
00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:45,645
Not only me

693
00:37:45,770 --> 00:37:48,770
No one from a good family will
ask for your daughter's hand

694
00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:51,835
There will be men waiting to
get married 2nd and 3rd time

695
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:53,060
Go and ask them

696
00:37:53,085 --> 00:37:54,605
First get out of here

697
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:11,530
We cut our ties long ago
because of her nature

698
00:38:11,570 --> 00:38:13,450
Why did you go there again?

699
00:38:13,530 --> 00:38:15,250
I told him not to go

700
00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:17,250
Don't I know her true colors?

701
00:38:17,290 --> 00:38:20,170
As if she has suddenly
turned over a new leaf!

702
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:22,770
I went there only because
his father isn't alive

703
00:38:22,850 --> 00:38:24,244
Because I gave her
my word in haste...

704
00:38:24,269 --> 00:38:25,789
...I've been patient till now

705
00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:28,530
She has every right
to malign me

706
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:31,730
But she has no right
to deride my daughter

707
00:38:31,825 --> 00:38:33,185
Neither is she qualified

708
00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:37,290
Find a good groom
for my daughter

709
00:38:38,290 --> 00:38:40,330
Before her son gets married...

710
00:38:40,591 --> 00:38:42,511
...I must get my daughter
married in style

711
00:38:42,536 --> 00:38:43,776
Okay?

712
00:38:44,850 --> 00:38:45,890
- Sumathi?
- What?

713
00:38:45,915 --> 00:38:47,555
My sister has delivered a baby

714
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:49,330
I'm going home this evening

715
00:38:49,650 --> 00:38:51,494
2 people will be
coming here from Orathanadu

716
00:38:51,519 --> 00:38:53,559
Give this list to them

717
00:38:53,584 --> 00:38:56,144
A person by name
Rajendran will come

718
00:38:56,285 --> 00:38:58,845
Give him this sample bottle

719
00:38:59,090 --> 00:39:01,499
Looks like you will be away for long

720
00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:03,010
I'll be away for 10 days

721
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:04,090
Is that so?

722
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,280
Got an A4 sheet?

723
00:39:05,305 --> 00:39:06,145
Yes

724
00:39:06,170 --> 00:39:07,210
Have you informed Vetri?

725
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:08,930
No, I'll tell him
after I reach home

726
00:39:08,955 --> 00:39:09,595
One will do

727
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:10,580
That's better

728
00:39:10,690 --> 00:39:12,570
Otherwise he will follow you

729
00:39:12,890 --> 00:39:14,050
He is crazy

730
00:39:14,090 --> 00:39:15,850
Oho! What about you?

731
00:39:15,890 --> 00:39:16,850
Shut up!

732
00:39:16,890 --> 00:39:18,410
I know what's brewing

733
00:39:18,450 --> 00:39:21,250
Both of you got your feelings
bottled up right inside

734
00:39:21,290 --> 00:39:22,850
And laying it on thick?

735
00:39:22,970 --> 00:39:24,410
No build up at all

736
00:39:26,277 --> 00:39:28,610
Shall I tell you something?

737
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:31,690
Call Vetri today and
profess your love to him

738
00:39:31,730 --> 00:39:33,410
Then go home

739
00:39:33,770 --> 00:39:38,530
After you've expressed your love,
unable to meet him for 10 days...

740
00:39:38,690 --> 00:39:41,210
...that's a special feeling, you know

741
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:49,610
Only when the wife goes
to visit her parents...

742
00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:51,250
...can the husband
eat his favorite food

743
00:39:51,290 --> 00:39:53,050
Are you sure
she is at her place?

744
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:55,930
I went and dropped her

745
00:39:55,970 --> 00:39:57,210
In her mother's place

746
00:39:57,385 --> 00:39:59,025
Her father was there too

747
00:39:59,050 --> 00:40:01,450
What about the 4 'planets'
revolving around her?!

748
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:15,170
'The number you have dialed
is busy with another person'

749
00:40:15,210 --> 00:40:17,370
'Please try after some days!'

750
00:40:17,971 --> 00:40:19,251
Othaasai, finish your lunch

751
00:40:19,276 --> 00:40:21,196
They will have a feast
before I finish my lunch!

752
00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:28,170
"Janani, Janani
You are my world, in harmony"

753
00:40:28,979 --> 00:40:29,779
Yes, madam

754
00:40:29,804 --> 00:40:31,644
Are you free?
Can I talk now?

755
00:40:31,810 --> 00:40:33,290
I was just feeding the cattle

756
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:36,490
Oh! Shall I call later?

757
00:40:36,515 --> 00:40:38,635
The buffalo ran away
just now refusing to eat!

758
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:40,730
I'm all ears
Tell me now

759
00:40:41,770 --> 00:40:44,250
I need to talk to you

760
00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:45,410
Go ahead

761
00:40:46,130 --> 00:40:49,770
Can you guess my thoughts?

762
00:40:50,770 --> 00:40:55,130
Is it about the book I bought
'How to learn Malayalam in 30 days'?

763
00:40:55,155 --> 00:40:57,115
That's really tough

764
00:40:57,210 --> 00:40:58,410
Not that

765
00:40:59,330 --> 00:41:01,410
About the new crop of seeds?

766
00:41:01,610 --> 00:41:02,311
Not that either

767
00:41:02,412 --> 00:41:03,772
About the Vermicompost

768
00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:05,010
What else can it be?

769
00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:06,850
Such a block head!
Mud between his ears

770
00:41:06,890 --> 00:41:08,248
Yes...yes, about the mud

771
00:41:08,273 --> 00:41:09,913
You asked me to test that mud

772
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:11,490
I forgot

773
00:41:11,810 --> 00:41:13,090
How do I explain?

774
00:41:13,130 --> 00:41:15,330
You've stopped your soil research?

775
00:41:16,730 --> 00:41:18,050
Can you understand?

776
00:41:18,570 --> 00:41:20,490
I said I wanted to talk to you

777
00:41:20,570 --> 00:41:22,250
That's why I said
I am all ears

778
00:41:23,556 --> 00:41:26,316
This isn't something
I can share over the phone

779
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:28,650
I need to talk face to face

780
00:41:31,044 --> 00:41:33,524
If I had known earlier
I would have come at once

781
00:41:33,549 --> 00:41:35,109
When and where?

782
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:36,770
We'll meet at 6:00 p.m

783
00:41:36,890 --> 00:41:40,410
"On tenterhooks I thought
When will she open her heart?"

784
00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:45,410
"Yes or no, what will it be?
What will she tell me?"

785
00:41:45,490 --> 00:41:50,370
"Losing my mind, I thought
When will she open her heart?"

786
00:41:50,410 --> 00:41:55,410
"Drizzles in my mind always
Thoughts drenched in rain sprays"

787
00:41:55,490 --> 00:41:59,810
"Mixture of fear and melancholy
my heart beats for her only"

788
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:04,610
"Agitated, I wander aimlessly"

789
00:42:04,690 --> 00:42:09,810
"Heart in my mouth I wait vulnerably"

790
00:42:09,890 --> 00:42:14,730
"Excited, I wander aimlessly"

791
00:42:14,770 --> 00:42:20,490
"Jumpy and jittery
I wait helplessly"

792
00:42:20,570 --> 00:42:25,050
"Yes or no, what will it be?
What will she tell me?"

793
00:42:25,410 --> 00:42:30,050
"On tenterhooks and distraught
When will she open her heart?"

794
00:42:30,370 --> 00:42:34,970
"Yes or no, what will it be?
What will she tell me?"

795
00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:40,290
"On tenterhooks I thought
When will she open her heart?"

796
00:42:40,450 --> 00:42:45,450
"Drizzles in my mind always
Thoughts drenched in rain sprays"

797
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:49,810
"Mixture of fear and melancholy
my heart beats for her only"

798
00:42:49,890 --> 00:42:54,730
"Agitated, I wander aimlessly"

799
00:42:54,810 --> 00:43:00,090
"Heart in my mouth I wait helplessly"

800
00:43:19,650 --> 00:43:20,930
Don't spill

801
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:26,130
I told you not to spill

802
00:43:26,155 --> 00:43:27,915
You yelled at me
In that jerk, it spilt over

803
00:43:28,010 --> 00:43:30,090
I've been watching you
for quite sometime

804
00:43:30,130 --> 00:43:31,633
You seem to be
in a strange mood?

805
00:43:31,658 --> 00:43:33,018
What is that supposed to mean?

806
00:43:33,043 --> 00:43:35,683
You're talking to yourself
and smiling without a reason

807
00:43:35,930 --> 00:43:38,690
You're suddenly feeling shy

808
00:43:38,770 --> 00:43:40,730
Where did all this come from?

809
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:44,280
Hey! My first born!

810
00:43:44,305 --> 00:43:45,936
You're hiding something
from your mother

811
00:43:45,961 --> 00:43:46,761
Out with it

812
00:43:46,786 --> 00:43:47,986
I'll tell you when it is okay

813
00:43:48,054 --> 00:43:49,054
Tell me right now

814
00:43:49,079 --> 00:43:51,959
Aren't you the first person
I tell always of my eventful life?

815
00:43:51,984 --> 00:43:53,304
Of course

816
00:43:54,330 --> 00:43:55,450
Go

817
00:44:03,130 --> 00:44:04,130
See you

818
00:44:04,930 --> 00:44:06,170
What happened?

819
00:44:07,850 --> 00:44:09,330
What has upset you now?

820
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:10,635
Subha called

821
00:44:10,660 --> 00:44:11,900
Some problem it seems

822
00:44:12,042 --> 00:44:13,602
She wanted me
to come over at once

823
00:44:13,690 --> 00:44:14,599
What's the problem?

824
00:44:14,624 --> 00:44:15,664
Don't know

825
00:44:15,893 --> 00:44:17,453
I'll just go and see her

826
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:30,610
What, Vetri?

827
00:44:30,650 --> 00:44:32,530
I left my phone behind

828
00:44:35,090 --> 00:44:36,650
Damned if I pick his call

829
00:44:36,690 --> 00:44:38,410
Darned if I didn't!

830
00:44:41,690 --> 00:44:42,770
Hello?

831
00:44:44,090 --> 00:44:45,970
Can I talk to Vetri sir?

832
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:47,050
Sir...?!

833
00:44:47,250 --> 00:44:48,696
He just stepped out

834
00:44:48,810 --> 00:44:49,850
Who are you?

835
00:44:50,330 --> 00:44:52,330
I'm speaking from Agri-college

836
00:44:52,891 --> 00:44:54,091
Did he leave just now?

837
00:44:54,116 --> 00:44:56,836
He said it was something urgent

838
00:44:56,861 --> 00:44:59,061
He was in a rush
and forgot his phone

839
00:44:59,330 --> 00:45:01,090
Should I give him
any message?

840
00:45:01,130 --> 00:45:01,890
No, it's okay

841
00:45:01,930 --> 00:45:03,010
Okay

842
00:45:08,770 --> 00:45:10,290
Is it this street?

843
00:45:11,490 --> 00:45:13,450
That's what she said

844
00:45:13,970 --> 00:45:15,850
This is the house, come in

845
00:45:17,130 --> 00:45:18,450
Does he know
who we are?

846
00:45:18,490 --> 00:45:19,793
- Don't know
- Saravanan, right?

847
00:45:20,061 --> 00:45:20,941
Come in

848
00:45:22,130 --> 00:45:23,610
He is calling us

849
00:45:26,010 --> 00:45:27,250
Please come in

850
00:45:28,890 --> 00:45:30,090
Who is Saravanan?

851
00:45:30,162 --> 00:45:31,296
- I'm Saravanan
- Is that so?

852
00:45:31,321 --> 00:45:32,481
Subha told me

853
00:45:32,506 --> 00:45:34,066
I'm Baghyam's father
Please go inside

854
00:45:34,330 --> 00:45:35,810
Hello, Saravana
Subha is upstairs

855
00:45:35,850 --> 00:45:37,652
- Why don't you go in too?
- Give me your phone

856
00:45:37,677 --> 00:45:38,997
Use my phone

857
00:45:39,267 --> 00:45:40,267
It's okay

858
00:45:43,530 --> 00:45:44,930
'Dear customer'

859
00:45:45,010 --> 00:45:47,330
'Since you don't have
sufficient balance...'

860
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:49,450
'...your service has been
temporarily suspended'

861
00:46:11,770 --> 00:46:14,530
I told my parents I don't
want to get married now

862
00:46:14,610 --> 00:46:16,490
But no one is taking me seriously

863
00:46:17,050 --> 00:46:19,330
I don't know what to do now

864
00:46:22,210 --> 00:46:23,970
Do something, Saravana

865
00:46:35,410 --> 00:46:37,450
Were you leaving home
to meet Janani?

866
00:46:47,688 --> 00:46:48,648
Tell me

867
00:46:48,690 --> 00:46:49,473
So sorry

868
00:46:49,530 --> 00:46:51,370
You know how long I waited

869
00:46:51,410 --> 00:46:53,490
I wanted to inform you

870
00:46:53,570 --> 00:46:55,170
I left my phone behind at home

871
00:46:55,250 --> 00:46:56,681
A sudden emergency cropped up

872
00:46:56,796 --> 00:46:58,276
I thought I'll meet you after that

873
00:46:58,410 --> 00:47:00,330
But it was late
I guess you left

874
00:47:01,250 --> 00:47:02,873
Where are you now?
I'll be there in a jiffy

875
00:47:02,898 --> 00:47:05,778
I'm in a bus now
On my way to Cochin

876
00:47:05,803 --> 00:47:07,123
What are you saying?

877
00:47:07,148 --> 00:47:08,228
When are you back?

878
00:47:08,333 --> 00:47:09,613
10 days or so

879
00:47:09,810 --> 00:47:12,490
I have to talk to you
the moment I am back

880
00:47:12,530 --> 00:47:13,810
No excuses, please

881
00:47:13,850 --> 00:47:14,810
Same here

882
00:47:14,850 --> 00:47:15,850
What?

883
00:47:15,890 --> 00:47:17,210
If I should copy your style

884
00:47:17,250 --> 00:47:19,290
'This isn't something
I can share over the phone'

885
00:47:19,330 --> 00:47:20,890
'I need to talk face to face'

886
00:47:22,530 --> 00:47:23,373
Is that so?

887
00:47:23,530 --> 00:47:24,530
Exactly

888
00:47:24,555 --> 00:47:26,875
We could have met today!

889
00:47:26,930 --> 00:47:28,810
I swear I don't understand

890
00:47:30,330 --> 00:47:31,852
What did you say?

891
00:47:31,877 --> 00:47:33,157
Never mind

892
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:35,690
You made me wait, right?

893
00:47:35,730 --> 00:47:37,330
Now your turn
to wait for 10 days

894
00:47:37,770 --> 00:47:38,810
Bye

895
00:47:57,530 --> 00:48:01,770
"Silver moon of joy
shines blithely in the sky"

896
00:48:01,810 --> 00:48:06,079
"Full moon overflowing
with happiness glittering"

897
00:48:06,104 --> 00:48:07,877
"Looking at me-"

898
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:09,490
'Looking at you...?'

899
00:48:10,290 --> 00:48:14,770
"Looking at me smilingly
Speaks a language silently"

900
00:48:14,801 --> 00:48:19,121
"Crescent moon glows contentedly"

901
00:48:19,170 --> 00:48:23,450
"Soft breeze caresses you with liberty"

902
00:48:23,490 --> 00:48:27,290
"Gentle breeze caresses you rightfully"

903
00:48:27,370 --> 00:48:29,690
"Thinking of this-"

904
00:48:29,770 --> 00:48:31,130
'Thinking of this?'

905
00:48:32,090 --> 00:48:35,850
"Thinking of this bliss
my heart leaps-"

906
00:48:36,418 --> 00:48:37,890
Your first born wants to
tell you something

907
00:48:37,930 --> 00:48:39,850
Does he want to study
to become a collector?

908
00:48:39,890 --> 00:48:42,010
He should have passed
10th grade to do so

909
00:48:42,090 --> 00:48:43,410
Tell him that

910
00:48:44,530 --> 00:48:46,490
I told you it is very important

911
00:48:51,210 --> 00:48:52,850
Very important it seems

912
00:48:58,136 --> 00:48:59,896
You shouldn't get startled

913
00:48:59,921 --> 00:49:01,789
Sravanan is in love
with his classmate

914
00:49:01,930 --> 00:49:03,330
She is in love with him too

915
00:49:03,410 --> 00:49:05,530
Her parents have started
looking for a groom for her

916
00:49:05,570 --> 00:49:07,717
Ask him to discuss
this alliance with her father

917
00:49:07,742 --> 00:49:11,582
One rotten apple will
spoil the whole barrel

918
00:49:11,607 --> 00:49:12,887
Hasn't he done just that?

919
00:49:12,912 --> 00:49:14,672
It is my brother's wish

920
00:49:14,697 --> 00:49:15,857
If he wished...?

921
00:49:16,012 --> 00:49:17,572
Recommendation, huh?

922
00:49:17,597 --> 00:49:20,117
I won't be bothered
if he had fallen in love

923
00:49:20,142 --> 00:49:22,302
I've given him for good long ago

924
00:49:22,327 --> 00:49:24,127
But I never thought
he would fall in love!

925
00:49:24,173 --> 00:49:27,493
I thought you'll at least bring
honor and pride to our family

926
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:30,360
You've stooped to this level and
made me bow my head in shame

927
00:49:30,385 --> 00:49:32,665
On top of it, this useless boy
is endorsing your love

928
00:49:32,690 --> 00:49:33,810
Why are you yelling at him?

929
00:49:33,835 --> 00:49:35,395
I'll clobber you
Rushing to his defense?

930
00:49:35,490 --> 00:49:37,250
Can't even shave
your bristle-moustache!

931
00:49:37,290 --> 00:49:40,370
What's this rush to fall in love,
get married and all this bullshit

932
00:49:40,810 --> 00:49:41,890
Pa...?

933
00:49:52,690 --> 00:49:54,730
But you shouldn't lose
your temper like this either

934
00:49:57,370 --> 00:49:59,410
I wanted him to
become an auditor

935
00:50:00,010 --> 00:50:02,730
Won't I be angry
if he trashes my dream?

936
00:50:03,140 --> 00:50:05,100
Do all our dreams come true?

937
00:50:05,330 --> 00:50:08,450
Your dream was to get
an educated wife

938
00:50:08,490 --> 00:50:10,490
But you got me instead!

939
00:50:10,770 --> 00:50:12,810
Aren't we happy as a couple?

940
00:50:13,570 --> 00:50:14,918
What are you hinting at?

941
00:50:14,943 --> 00:50:17,823
Go and meet the girl's father

942
00:50:18,806 --> 00:50:20,490
Do you have any idea
what you are saying?

943
00:50:20,530 --> 00:50:22,450
Because I don't have any idea...

944
00:50:22,490 --> 00:50:24,970
...I keep mum except for
asking you to eat 3 square meals

945
00:50:26,410 --> 00:50:27,720
If it had been any other boy...

946
00:50:27,745 --> 00:50:29,065
...he would've brought her home

947
00:50:29,090 --> 00:50:31,370
Our sons respect you
as their father, right?

948
00:50:33,170 --> 00:50:34,810
What is your opinion?

949
00:50:34,890 --> 00:50:36,250
This is what our son wants

950
00:50:37,050 --> 00:50:39,090
If we hurt our finger
it is bound to hurt

951
00:50:39,130 --> 00:50:40,610
Can we just chop it off?

952
00:50:41,930 --> 00:50:43,770
I am stunned
Is this you talking?

953
00:50:43,810 --> 00:50:45,530
When have you let me
voice my thoughts?

954
00:50:45,570 --> 00:50:47,250
I open my mouth and you hush-

955
00:50:47,290 --> 00:50:48,450
Hey! Don't start your lament

956
00:50:48,497 --> 00:50:50,057
Go to bed, we will
discuss this later

957
00:50:50,090 --> 00:50:51,930
- Typical!
- Go

958
00:51:01,530 --> 00:51:03,570
Did you tell him
like how I taught you?

959
00:51:03,595 --> 00:51:04,715
Verbatim, word to word

960
00:51:04,740 --> 00:51:06,540
But towards the end,
he smelt something fishy

961
00:51:06,565 --> 00:51:07,525
I thought as much

962
00:51:07,650 --> 00:51:09,170
When I sent you
I thought so

963
00:51:09,210 --> 00:51:11,490
I knew you would over act
and make a mess of it

964
00:51:11,515 --> 00:51:12,715
But I covered up well

965
00:51:12,740 --> 00:51:13,540
Really?

966
00:51:13,565 --> 00:51:15,125
I swear
Trust me

967
00:51:16,050 --> 00:51:19,170
You've done something constructive
only today other than cooking

968
00:51:19,210 --> 00:51:20,330
Go to bed

969
00:51:20,450 --> 00:51:25,010
According to you what do you think
our 'teacher' will do now?

970
00:51:31,770 --> 00:51:34,810
Can I ask you something?
You shouldn't misunderstand

971
00:51:34,850 --> 00:51:36,410
No, no....go ahead

972
00:51:36,690 --> 00:51:38,650
I think you belong
to another caste

973
00:51:39,330 --> 00:51:41,770
She is my only daughter
She is my whole world

974
00:51:41,850 --> 00:51:44,730
Because you asked, if I fix
this alliance outside my caste...

975
00:51:44,770 --> 00:51:49,490
...tomorrow none of my kith and kin,
friends and relatives will step on my porch

976
00:51:49,970 --> 00:51:52,781
Having just 1 daughter
I'll be literally an outcast

977
00:51:52,859 --> 00:51:55,130
This holds good for you too

978
00:51:55,770 --> 00:51:58,570
Youngsters now will say it is easy
to change with the times

979
00:51:58,905 --> 00:52:01,265
But this caste system
is our fulcrum

980
00:52:01,290 --> 00:52:03,970
Any chap from any caste
can change his religion

981
00:52:04,050 --> 00:52:05,930
But he can't change his caste!

982
00:52:06,330 --> 00:52:08,570
You and I are living
in this social system

983
00:52:09,050 --> 00:52:12,570
I don't have the strength
to change our society, master

984
00:52:14,370 --> 00:52:16,490
I hope I didn't speak out of turn

985
00:52:16,530 --> 00:52:19,010
You are being
more than accommodative

986
00:52:19,370 --> 00:52:22,410
I was thinking you'll meet me
with axe and sickle!

987
00:52:22,450 --> 00:52:24,770
You are being so civil and
courteous towards me

988
00:52:25,050 --> 00:52:28,010
If I still don't understand you
I'm the world's biggest fool

989
00:52:28,050 --> 00:52:29,930
If I have wounded you in any way...

990
00:52:29,970 --> 00:52:31,250
...please accept my apologies

991
00:52:31,290 --> 00:52:32,530
Not at all

992
00:52:33,777 --> 00:52:35,217
He is such a refined gentleman

993
00:52:35,250 --> 00:52:38,450
He explained the practical difficulties
we face in our day to day life so well

994
00:52:39,446 --> 00:52:42,686
Ask your son to forget that girl
and carry on with his studies

995
00:52:43,414 --> 00:52:44,974
If he is unable to...

996
00:52:44,999 --> 00:52:48,879
...ask him to open a cycle shop next to
the fertilizer shop and fix flat tires

997
00:53:00,516 --> 00:53:01,556
Tell me, Shuba

998
00:53:01,690 --> 00:53:04,290
My father has asked the groom
to 'see' me at the village festival

999
00:53:04,330 --> 00:53:05,810
Are you serious?

1000
00:53:05,850 --> 00:53:07,250
Sudden plan

1001
00:53:08,330 --> 00:53:09,610
That's why I called you

1002
00:53:11,785 --> 00:53:13,185
Shall we elope?

1003
00:53:13,210 --> 00:53:16,210
No way, Saravana

1004
00:53:16,290 --> 00:53:19,050
How can I be happy
after humiliating my parents?

1005
00:53:20,330 --> 00:53:21,770
Do something, Saravana

1006
00:53:22,010 --> 00:53:22,970
Please

1007
00:53:38,050 --> 00:53:39,410
Shall we kidnap her?

1008
00:53:41,970 --> 00:53:43,250
Best solution!

1009
00:53:44,170 --> 00:53:45,370
Kidnap?

1010
00:53:45,410 --> 00:53:47,970
She doesn't even want to elope
As if she'll agree to be kidnapped

1011
00:53:47,995 --> 00:53:49,355
You think we'll inform her?

1012
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:51,420
What if she creates
some problem after that?

1013
00:53:51,530 --> 00:53:54,610
You are sure she loves you?
She wants to be your wife?

1014
00:53:54,650 --> 00:53:56,530
Then she won't create
any problem for sure

1015
00:53:56,570 --> 00:53:57,530
That's decided

1016
00:53:57,610 --> 00:53:59,490
How can just the 2 of us do this?

1017
00:53:59,530 --> 00:54:00,850
I have the right contacts

1018
00:54:00,930 --> 00:54:01,850
Who?

1019
00:54:05,610 --> 00:54:06,890
They are just 4

1020
00:54:06,930 --> 00:54:08,290
Equal to 400 men!

1021
00:54:08,330 --> 00:54:12,410
"Praise be to Lord Shiva"

1022
00:54:24,250 --> 00:54:27,450
As long as we are alive
love won't die, pal

1023
00:54:36,530 --> 00:54:39,090
So, the girl is not willing to come

1024
00:54:39,170 --> 00:54:40,090
Right?

1025
00:54:42,010 --> 00:54:43,770
Then kidnapping her
is our only solution

1026
00:54:47,770 --> 00:54:50,010
Pal, get the kidnap kit

1027
00:54:59,210 --> 00:55:02,050
We don't pit our wits into
rash moves like before, pal

1028
00:55:02,130 --> 00:55:04,450
He hurt his leg

1029
00:55:04,490 --> 00:55:06,090
He finds it tough even to walk

1030
00:55:06,170 --> 00:55:09,090
But he is stubborn enough to be
part of every operation of ours

1031
00:55:09,570 --> 00:55:11,130
So we changed
our route a little bit

1032
00:55:12,650 --> 00:55:15,250
If the person concerned
is 10' away, we spray

1033
00:55:15,810 --> 00:55:17,570
A little closer
we use chloroform

1034
00:55:19,250 --> 00:55:21,090
If they shout, this knife

1035
00:55:21,130 --> 00:55:22,690
Let's not go into
the violence route

1036
00:55:22,730 --> 00:55:24,930
I know you prefer silence
to violence, my dear friend

1037
00:55:25,001 --> 00:55:26,241
So we'll fix on chloroform

1038
00:55:26,290 --> 00:55:27,370
What if something happe-

1039
00:55:27,410 --> 00:55:28,210
Not to worry

1040
00:55:28,250 --> 00:55:29,954
Your girl will only faint

1041
00:55:30,050 --> 00:55:32,130
Dab just 4 drops and
stick this under her nose

1042
00:55:32,225 --> 00:55:34,305
She'll be in another world
for 4 hours at a stretch

1043
00:55:34,330 --> 00:55:37,130
If you keep this under her nose
how will she not talk-

1044
00:55:37,210 --> 00:55:39,210
Don't fall into the water

1045
00:55:46,810 --> 00:55:48,610
Move back...move

1046
00:55:57,450 --> 00:55:58,490
Othaasai

1047
00:55:58,570 --> 00:55:59,970
Yov! Othaasai

1048
00:56:00,050 --> 00:56:01,490
Let's go

1049
00:56:03,010 --> 00:56:05,010
- Why are we here?
- To kidnap the girl

1050
00:56:05,035 --> 00:56:06,195
Why did you bring me along?

1051
00:56:06,220 --> 00:56:08,632
- You won't even lend 1 hand?
- I won't come even with 5 hands!

1052
00:56:08,657 --> 00:56:10,657
They will recognize me!

1053
00:56:10,985 --> 00:56:12,385
Saravana, move a little bit

1054
00:56:12,410 --> 00:56:14,181
Will the concerned person
be there by now, pal?

1055
00:56:14,292 --> 00:56:15,892
Will she be there now?

1056
00:56:15,917 --> 00:56:16,797
Yes

1057
00:56:16,899 --> 00:56:19,259
If you have her photo
please give it to me

1058
00:56:19,370 --> 00:56:20,770
Vetri broke my phone

1059
00:56:20,795 --> 00:56:22,075
Total damage

1060
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:23,205
Okay, I'll come

1061
00:56:23,230 --> 00:56:24,350
No, you wait here, pal

1062
00:56:24,570 --> 00:56:25,850
As soon as we kidnap her...

1063
00:56:25,875 --> 00:56:28,115
...you must leave this place
in the blink of an eye

1064
00:56:28,293 --> 00:56:30,051
Pal, you don't even know that girl

1065
00:56:30,076 --> 00:56:32,316
How will you find her
that too in this crowd?

1066
00:56:32,388 --> 00:56:33,948
There must be
about 5000 people here?

1067
00:56:34,035 --> 00:56:35,395
If you assume
half are women...

1068
00:56:35,490 --> 00:56:36,237
...count is 2500

1069
00:56:36,262 --> 00:56:39,222
Out of that 2500, if you negate
1500 married women, balance is 1000

1070
00:56:39,450 --> 00:56:42,170
Babies from 1 year old to 10
will be around 500

1071
00:56:42,210 --> 00:56:44,290
In the remaining 500,
50 would've gone to college

1072
00:56:44,330 --> 00:56:46,770
10 would've studied in the same
college as your brother

1073
00:56:46,810 --> 00:56:48,384
You told me she is
the President's daughter

1074
00:56:48,409 --> 00:56:51,889
From his expression I am sure
he would've chosen a beautiful girl

1075
00:56:52,130 --> 00:56:54,500
Easy to find that 1 girl, pal
I'll take care

1076
00:56:54,525 --> 00:56:56,125
Why rattle all these calculations?

1077
00:56:56,150 --> 00:56:57,590
I know that girl very well

1078
00:56:57,810 --> 00:56:59,460
- Okay, you come along
- I must go back home

1079
00:56:59,485 --> 00:57:01,525
You'll anyway sit at home
with your lips zipped!

1080
00:57:04,610 --> 00:57:06,970
'Has he told the whole world?'

1081
00:57:09,850 --> 00:57:12,930
- Sammandhi'ma, how are you?
- I am fine

1082
00:57:12,970 --> 00:57:14,890
- Are you doing good?
- Everyone is fine

1083
00:57:14,930 --> 00:57:16,250
Make sure he sticks to us

1084
00:57:16,290 --> 00:57:17,410
Follow us, boss

1085
00:57:17,450 --> 00:57:19,250
My memory of her face
is faded and light

1086
00:57:19,330 --> 00:57:21,690
But her father will know
my face close up tight!

1087
00:57:23,250 --> 00:57:25,770
When it comes to helping someone
our heels should fly, boss

1088
00:57:25,850 --> 00:57:27,530
'Your skin can bear the thrashing'

1089
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:29,130
'But I am not thick skinned!'

1090
00:57:33,810 --> 00:57:35,290
They have a lot of clout

1091
00:57:35,370 --> 00:57:36,650
We should be very careful

1092
00:57:36,690 --> 00:57:38,370
Hey Othaasai, is she the girl-

1093
00:57:39,410 --> 00:57:42,010
- Where did Othaasai go?
- He was with Pandi

1094
00:57:42,105 --> 00:57:43,545
Go look for him that side

1095
00:57:43,570 --> 00:57:44,850
Look over there

1096
00:58:13,690 --> 00:58:14,890
'Bro...bro...bro, for me'

1097
00:58:14,930 --> 00:58:15,970
Go and fetch him

1098
00:58:16,010 --> 00:58:18,170
Give me some, bro

1099
00:58:18,250 --> 00:58:19,810
How long I've been asking?

1100
00:58:19,890 --> 00:58:20,970
Pass it through someone

1101
00:58:21,010 --> 00:58:22,090
Pandi, come

1102
00:58:22,170 --> 00:58:23,058
I'm asking for you too

1103
00:58:23,083 --> 00:58:26,138
- Where is Othaasai?
- He was right behind me

1104
00:58:27,303 --> 00:58:28,583
First look for him

1105
00:58:28,608 --> 00:58:29,968
Glutton of the first order!

1106
00:58:38,130 --> 00:58:39,370
Try and identify me

1107
00:58:40,930 --> 00:58:42,250
You are unable to?

1108
00:58:49,090 --> 00:58:50,290
Don't tell anyone

1109
00:58:50,370 --> 00:58:51,730
I'm Othaasai

1110
00:58:52,010 --> 00:58:53,970
Now I'll show you that girl

1111
00:58:54,410 --> 00:58:55,650
Follow me

1112
00:59:15,410 --> 00:59:16,970
Do you see that group there?

1113
00:59:17,010 --> 00:59:18,890
There are groups
all over the temple!

1114
00:59:20,410 --> 00:59:23,170
Can you see that gentleman
in a white shirt, looking so refined?

1115
00:59:23,250 --> 00:59:24,050
Yes

1116
00:59:24,090 --> 00:59:25,450
He is the President

1117
00:59:26,210 --> 00:59:27,490
Show us the girl

1118
00:59:27,530 --> 00:59:31,290
Next to him is a girl
clad in a yellow-

1119
00:59:31,370 --> 00:59:32,890
Why is he pointing at me?

1120
00:59:32,930 --> 00:59:35,170
Half sari...half sari-

1121
00:59:35,330 --> 00:59:38,130
Yellow half sari, right?
We'll handle her

1122
01:00:57,450 --> 01:00:59,330
Get into the car

1123
01:01:02,610 --> 01:01:03,810
Start

1124
01:01:03,850 --> 01:01:04,610
You-

1125
01:01:04,650 --> 01:01:05,810
No time to talk, leave now

1126
01:01:05,850 --> 01:01:07,010
Go...go

1127
01:01:07,570 --> 01:01:10,450
How will I find them
in this darkness?

1128
01:01:10,530 --> 01:01:12,250
Why did they turn on the lights?

1129
01:01:12,330 --> 01:01:14,890
If they find me,
they will squeeze me dry

1130
01:01:17,210 --> 01:01:18,770
He flew like a rocket!

1131
01:01:18,810 --> 01:01:19,650
Start

1132
01:01:19,690 --> 01:01:21,890
Hey! Vagabond
At least you take me along

1133
01:01:21,970 --> 01:01:23,770
Start...hey Pandi, come

1134
01:01:23,850 --> 01:01:25,010
Get in

1135
01:01:26,410 --> 01:01:29,450
Othaasai, as long as
we are alive, love won't die

1136
01:01:30,410 --> 01:01:31,850
I'll die soon!

1137
01:01:31,890 --> 01:01:33,930
See you in our next
Operation, Othaasai

1138
01:01:34,010 --> 01:01:37,210
My 'yellow shirt king'!
He won't let me down ever

1139
01:01:37,250 --> 01:01:39,370
He stripped me bare
down to my underwear!

1140
01:01:45,370 --> 01:01:46,570
Yes, Othaasai

1141
01:01:46,610 --> 01:01:49,130
How could you strip me
and leave me stranded here?

1142
01:01:49,170 --> 01:01:50,490
Who left you behind?

1143
01:01:50,530 --> 01:01:53,010
Give us updates by the minute!

1144
01:01:53,090 --> 01:01:55,730
If you had told me this earlier
I wouldn't be stripped to the skin

1145
01:01:55,762 --> 01:01:57,282
Zip your lips
and do what I say

1146
01:01:57,330 --> 01:01:58,370
Okay

1147
01:01:58,690 --> 01:02:00,290
Icing on the cake!

1148
01:02:10,650 --> 01:02:12,250
Othaasai, all is well?

1149
01:02:12,290 --> 01:02:13,730
Till now all is well

1150
01:02:13,810 --> 01:02:15,090
You drive carefully

1151
01:02:15,130 --> 01:02:16,570
No one saw you, right?

1152
01:02:16,610 --> 01:02:19,130
No one can recognize me

1153
01:02:19,170 --> 01:02:20,570
I'm well disguised you see

1154
01:02:20,650 --> 01:02:21,970
I'll talk to you later

1155
01:02:22,010 --> 01:02:22,930
Okay

1156
01:02:23,010 --> 01:02:24,730
As if they can find me!

1157
01:02:28,730 --> 01:02:31,010
You've got sandalwood paste
smeared all over your body?

1158
01:02:31,050 --> 01:02:33,690
Is it some vow? Not pierced
your cheeks with silver skewers?

1159
01:02:33,715 --> 01:02:34,995
'It's all done and dusted'

1160
01:02:35,020 --> 01:02:36,100
I'm on my way home

1161
01:02:36,125 --> 01:02:38,325
Anyhow you'll sit there
with your lips zipped!

1162
01:02:38,903 --> 01:02:40,423
- Come with me
- Where to?

1163
01:02:40,448 --> 01:02:41,848
How can I let you go so easily?

1164
01:02:41,873 --> 01:02:43,593
- Sir...?
- Come...come

1165
01:02:44,345 --> 01:02:46,785
Vetri, she won't scream, right?

1166
01:02:46,865 --> 01:02:47,945
No, she won't

1167
01:02:47,970 --> 01:02:50,530
- Can we get married right now?
- Will you kindly shut up?

1168
01:02:50,562 --> 01:02:55,322
Othaasai, my daughter who
will become his daughter-in-law

1169
01:02:55,370 --> 01:02:58,570
They are attending this festival
only to see our daughter

1170
01:02:58,672 --> 01:03:00,872
'Famous last words!'

1171
01:03:01,090 --> 01:03:03,250
Why are you shivering?

1172
01:03:03,290 --> 01:03:06,130
On top of it this paste on your
body won't help, wear your shirt

1173
01:03:06,170 --> 01:03:08,610
Get Othaasai
a hot cup of tea

1174
01:03:09,210 --> 01:03:11,250
Why are you looking at me
like you're possessed?

1175
01:03:11,290 --> 01:03:12,050
Put on your shirt

1176
01:03:12,130 --> 01:03:13,490
'You shouldn't
beat me to a pulp'

1177
01:03:13,530 --> 01:03:14,970
Here's your tea

1178
01:03:15,610 --> 01:03:17,050
Go ahead, drink

1179
01:03:23,350 --> 01:03:26,630
Which girl did you kidnap?
The girl who served us tea is here

1180
01:03:28,810 --> 01:03:30,810
Hey! I believe
we got the wrong girl

1181
01:04:07,825 --> 01:04:09,425
Vetri, how about this?

1182
01:04:09,450 --> 01:04:11,233
Shall we leave her back
outside the temple?

1183
01:04:11,258 --> 01:04:12,498
I'll give you a solid slap

1184
01:04:12,730 --> 01:04:14,690
How can we abandon her
outside the temple?

1185
01:04:14,730 --> 01:04:16,370
What if someone abuses her?

1186
01:04:16,450 --> 01:04:17,930
Have you completely lost it?

1187
01:04:18,010 --> 01:04:20,264
- Any problem?
- Nothing, bro

1188
01:04:20,529 --> 01:04:22,049
I thought your car stalled

1189
01:04:22,090 --> 01:04:23,930
- No, all fine
- Okay, bro

1190
01:04:23,970 --> 01:04:25,210
Start the car

1191
01:04:32,890 --> 01:04:34,010
Let's go

1192
01:04:34,090 --> 01:04:35,650
- Vetri...?
- Get in

1193
01:04:46,850 --> 01:04:48,810
You kept me captive
for a whole night

1194
01:04:48,850 --> 01:04:50,730
And now you want to
drop me back home?

1195
01:04:50,770 --> 01:04:53,570
If someone had done this to
your sister will you keep quiet?

1196
01:04:54,530 --> 01:04:56,410
What will I tell my parents?

1197
01:04:56,610 --> 01:04:58,450
How can I face my people?

1198
01:04:59,730 --> 01:05:01,490
I'm getting married
in another 3 days

1199
01:05:02,410 --> 01:05:03,770
My God!

1200
01:05:09,410 --> 01:05:12,090
I didn't think it would go wrong
even in my wildest dreams

1201
01:05:14,730 --> 01:05:16,810
Listen, I'll fall at anyone's feet

1202
01:05:16,890 --> 01:05:18,970
I will tell them
you are not to blame

1203
01:05:19,010 --> 01:05:20,210
Trust me

1204
01:05:22,170 --> 01:05:23,850
Looks like our Latha

1205
01:05:23,930 --> 01:05:25,370
Get into the car

1206
01:05:27,930 --> 01:05:29,570
Call Arul immediately

1207
01:05:47,690 --> 01:05:50,650
Where is your daughter?

1208
01:05:52,370 --> 01:05:54,890
Do I look like an imbecile to you?

1209
01:05:54,970 --> 01:05:58,170
Kayavarnam, I've sent
our boys to look for her

1210
01:05:58,210 --> 01:05:59,330
Let them come

1211
01:05:59,370 --> 01:06:01,970
Why are you hassling him?

1212
01:06:02,050 --> 01:06:03,330
Am I torturing him?

1213
01:06:03,450 --> 01:06:05,530
After making the wedding official...

1214
01:06:05,610 --> 01:06:08,619
...I've invited my friends,
neighbors and relatives

1215
01:06:08,644 --> 01:06:11,964
I got to know my daughter-in-law
has eloped with some fellow

1216
01:06:11,989 --> 01:06:13,989
You think I'll sit quiet
twiddling my thumb?

1217
01:06:14,014 --> 01:06:16,734
Don't let your tongue run
without knowing the facts

1218
01:06:17,128 --> 01:06:18,688
I'm fully aware of
what has happened

1219
01:06:18,730 --> 01:06:20,130
Tell them what you saw

1220
01:06:20,170 --> 01:06:22,530
She was getting into the car
with 3 men in the outskirts

1221
01:06:22,570 --> 01:06:24,210
Muthu just called me

1222
01:06:24,250 --> 01:06:25,930
You so-called men of integrity!

1223
01:06:26,010 --> 01:06:28,330
You asked me to hold my tongue
till you knew the facts

1224
01:06:28,410 --> 01:06:30,970
You heard them?
Now what do you have to say?

1225
01:06:31,530 --> 01:06:32,650
Tell me

1226
01:06:35,490 --> 01:06:37,410
My daughter isn't that kind of girl

1227
01:06:37,530 --> 01:06:40,090
Even if I kill her, she won't
cross the line I draw

1228
01:06:40,170 --> 01:06:42,490
Now what happened?

1229
01:06:42,570 --> 01:06:44,330
How did she cross now?

1230
01:06:45,010 --> 01:06:48,090
Not qualified to raise
your daughter properly

1231
01:06:48,170 --> 01:06:50,850
Why do you pride yourself
in being a man?

1232
01:06:51,450 --> 01:06:53,450
Shameless!

1233
01:06:53,490 --> 01:06:56,490
You might as well
hang yourself to death

1234
01:07:18,130 --> 01:07:19,450
- You be in the car
- Why...?

1235
01:07:19,490 --> 01:07:20,610
Sit inside

1236
01:08:03,850 --> 01:08:05,610
Appa...?

1237
01:08:24,810 --> 01:08:26,570
He kidnapped one of our girls

1238
01:08:26,610 --> 01:08:27,610
Thrash him

1239
01:08:27,650 --> 01:08:29,130
Don't let him escape

1240
01:08:29,210 --> 01:08:31,890
Beat him to a pulp

1241
01:08:32,250 --> 01:08:33,730
What audacity!

1242
01:08:36,210 --> 01:08:38,170
(scuffle)

1243
01:08:39,490 --> 01:08:41,290
Listen to me

1244
01:08:44,410 --> 01:08:46,450
I'll bury you alive

1245
01:08:46,570 --> 01:08:49,010
Why are you looking?
Pound him senseless

1246
01:08:52,370 --> 01:08:54,250
Trample him to death

1247
01:09:03,610 --> 01:09:05,330
Smash his face

1248
01:09:36,090 --> 01:09:38,130
- Come in, chief
- Greetings

1249
01:09:39,690 --> 01:09:40,730
Tell me

1250
01:09:43,050 --> 01:09:44,730
You listen to me first

1251
01:09:44,810 --> 01:09:47,370
Okay, cut the call
I'll call you later

1252
01:09:50,130 --> 01:09:52,826
Problem has blown out of proportion
and gone up to the higher officials

1253
01:09:52,851 --> 01:09:55,571
A man has committed suicide
and a girl has been kidnapped

1254
01:09:55,770 --> 01:09:57,770
Only when she returns,
we can interrogate her

1255
01:09:57,810 --> 01:09:59,810
And then decide
First ask her to come

1256
01:09:59,850 --> 01:10:01,875
She's a girl in her early 20s
How can I bring her here?

1257
01:10:01,900 --> 01:10:03,980
She is old enough to elope?!
Ask her to come here

1258
01:10:04,005 --> 01:10:05,125
(loud angry voices)

1259
01:10:05,150 --> 01:10:08,630
'Ask him to come out first
He tarnished our image'

1260
01:10:08,752 --> 01:10:11,552
Maintain silence
I'm handling it, right?

1261
01:10:15,610 --> 01:10:18,650
After the last rites are done,
I'll ask them to bring the girl

1262
01:10:18,730 --> 01:10:20,850
When she comes
she will accuse Vetri

1263
01:10:20,875 --> 01:10:22,715
Let me go find a lawyer

1264
01:10:22,930 --> 01:10:24,210
Keep this

1265
01:10:30,530 --> 01:10:32,250
Latha, we are here
Don't worry

1266
01:10:32,330 --> 01:10:34,450
- Sakthi, come here
- Be brave when you speak up

1267
01:10:34,530 --> 01:10:36,290
- Leave me
- Shut up

1268
01:10:36,370 --> 01:10:37,610
You wait outside

1269
01:10:37,650 --> 01:10:39,290
You come in with me

1270
01:10:46,490 --> 01:10:47,890
Are you Latha?

1271
01:10:49,170 --> 01:10:52,130
Why did you elope with this chap
when you're engaged to another?

1272
01:10:52,170 --> 01:10:54,330
'He made a bride-to-be
come to the police station'

1273
01:10:54,410 --> 01:10:55,770
'Should dissect him'

1274
01:10:57,290 --> 01:10:59,810
Did you elope or
did they kidnap you?

1275
01:11:00,970 --> 01:11:01,810
Tell me

1276
01:11:01,890 --> 01:11:02,890
Can't you hear me?

1277
01:11:02,930 --> 01:11:04,650
Cat got your tongue or what?

1278
01:11:04,730 --> 01:11:07,370
I'm asking you and
not a word from you

1279
01:11:07,450 --> 01:11:08,490
Tell me

1280
01:11:08,570 --> 01:11:10,850
Did you run away or
did they abduct you?

1281
01:11:10,890 --> 01:11:13,130
'No girl from our village
will have such low morals'

1282
01:11:13,210 --> 01:11:14,730
Clear out now

1283
01:11:14,810 --> 01:11:16,490
Why are you hitting us, madam?

1284
01:11:16,530 --> 01:11:17,930
'Hit him instead'

1285
01:11:17,970 --> 01:11:20,970
Do you intend to
speak up or not?

1286
01:11:26,050 --> 01:11:27,570
I went of my own free will

1287
01:11:27,650 --> 01:11:29,970
'Whaaat? You should
be chopped to pieces'

1288
01:11:30,050 --> 01:11:32,450
'You disgraced us
Come outside'

1289
01:11:35,370 --> 01:11:37,810
Chief, she has gone
with him willingly

1290
01:11:37,890 --> 01:11:38,930
She's above 18

1291
01:11:38,970 --> 01:11:40,090
It's her call

1292
01:11:40,130 --> 01:11:42,490
'Let us see how you intend
showing your face back home'

1293
01:11:42,570 --> 01:11:43,850
(loud indignant protests)

1294
01:11:43,890 --> 01:11:45,770
Chief, ask all of them
to clear out first

1295
01:11:45,810 --> 01:11:47,130
If they create a ruckus...

1296
01:11:47,170 --> 01:11:48,490
...my actions will turn ugly

1297
01:11:48,530 --> 01:11:50,930
'Chief, she shouldn't step into
our village again'

1298
01:11:51,250 --> 01:11:53,930
If all of you
voice an opinion...

1299
01:11:53,970 --> 01:11:55,450
...what respect will I get?

1300
01:11:55,490 --> 01:11:56,370
Go

1301
01:11:56,395 --> 01:11:57,250
Go away

1302
01:11:57,330 --> 01:11:59,490
She humiliated us, chief
Our village name is at stake-

1303
01:11:59,530 --> 01:12:00,770
Clear out

1304
01:12:03,610 --> 01:12:08,490
You humiliated all the villagers and
spoilt the good reputation they prided on

1305
01:12:17,930 --> 01:12:20,850
Your respect for me
is unforgettable

1306
01:12:22,090 --> 01:12:23,370
I am so glad!!

1307
01:12:24,930 --> 01:12:25,970
'Constable'

1308
01:12:26,010 --> 01:12:27,653
'Get their signatures
and send them away'

1309
01:12:27,770 --> 01:12:28,890
'Okay, madam'

1310
01:12:32,130 --> 01:12:34,690
I want all of you to clear out

1311
01:12:34,730 --> 01:12:36,610
Nobody should stand here, go

1312
01:13:05,410 --> 01:13:07,090
Please stop the car

1313
01:13:21,530 --> 01:13:22,690
Hello...?

1314
01:13:25,370 --> 01:13:26,730
Wait a minute

1315
01:13:29,770 --> 01:13:30,890
For my sake you-

1316
01:13:30,930 --> 01:13:32,890
I didn't lie to save you

1317
01:13:33,618 --> 01:13:34,818
If I had told the truth...

1318
01:13:34,843 --> 01:13:37,323
...whoever is responsible
for my father's death

1319
01:13:37,450 --> 01:13:39,290
...I would have to
live with that family

1320
01:13:39,417 --> 01:13:41,617
That's why I said
I went of my own free will

1321
01:13:43,616 --> 01:13:45,776
After my father's demise...

1322
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:47,720
...this whole village
has isolated me

1323
01:13:49,010 --> 01:13:51,370
You have ruined my life

1324
01:13:55,810 --> 01:13:57,250
Please wait

1325
01:14:40,970 --> 01:14:43,730
Not even in my dreams
have I harmed a single soul

1326
01:14:44,970 --> 01:14:47,330
But I am the cause
for your present plight

1327
01:14:49,650 --> 01:14:52,850
If you trust me,
if you have faith in me...

1328
01:14:56,850 --> 01:14:58,610
...from this moment
I'll be there for you

1329
01:14:59,410 --> 01:15:00,570
Forever

1330
01:15:14,970 --> 01:15:17,330
'I need to talk to you'

1331
01:15:17,410 --> 01:15:18,490
'Same here'

1332
01:15:18,530 --> 01:15:20,490
'This isn't something
I can share over the phone'

1333
01:15:20,530 --> 01:15:21,730
'I need to talk face to face'

1334
01:15:21,850 --> 01:15:23,650
'You made me wait, right?'

1335
01:15:23,690 --> 01:15:25,690
'Now your turn
to wait for 10 days'

1336
01:15:36,170 --> 01:15:37,290
Hello, sir

1337
01:15:37,370 --> 01:15:39,370
He didn't pay me interest
for the past 2 months

1338
01:15:39,425 --> 01:15:41,265
That's why I got mad at your son

1339
01:15:41,387 --> 01:15:43,265
Don't lend him money
hereafter even if he asks

1340
01:15:43,290 --> 01:15:44,730
Okay, sir
I'll take leave

1341
01:15:47,370 --> 01:15:50,650
If I hear he has borrowed money again,
you will face the brunt of my anger

1342
01:15:50,690 --> 01:15:51,890
He borrowed only for his shop-

1343
01:15:51,930 --> 01:15:52,730
So...?

1344
01:15:52,770 --> 01:15:54,740
He borrows only from you
What is this new habit?

1345
01:15:54,845 --> 01:15:57,085
Look at this new
concern for his son

1346
01:15:57,250 --> 01:16:00,970
Last week the priest
in the temple told me

1347
01:16:00,995 --> 01:16:03,235
Father and son will
bond better as time goes by

1348
01:16:03,330 --> 01:16:05,055
It's happening exactly
as he predicted

1349
01:16:05,085 --> 01:16:07,205
Utter rubbish,
you silly female!

1350
01:16:07,370 --> 01:16:09,210
If I hear he is in debt-

1351
01:16:20,850 --> 01:16:22,610
What happened?

1352
01:16:35,050 --> 01:16:38,090
This is my father
This is my mother

1353
01:16:38,290 --> 01:16:39,570
This is my wife!

1354
01:16:54,770 --> 01:16:55,810
Come inside

1355
01:17:29,240 --> 01:17:32,400
Just because I fell in love
you lost your love!

1356
01:17:33,610 --> 01:17:36,810
Trying to do good for me
you've got a bad name, Vetri

1357
01:17:38,250 --> 01:17:41,090
All because of me
you are in this mess

1358
01:18:37,373 --> 01:18:38,613
1 minute

1359
01:18:40,290 --> 01:18:41,770
I need to talk to you

1360
01:18:58,450 --> 01:18:59,490
Ma

1361
01:19:01,690 --> 01:19:02,610
Maaa?

1362
01:19:16,810 --> 01:19:18,810
Why are you so upset?

1363
01:19:18,850 --> 01:19:20,890
Your father might have
a temper tantrum fit

1364
01:19:20,930 --> 01:19:22,610
But your mother is a poor soul

1365
01:19:22,690 --> 01:19:23,930
She's harmless

1366
01:19:24,490 --> 01:19:26,610
Your father might keep a long face

1367
01:19:26,690 --> 01:19:28,570
Will your mother
misunderstand you?

1368
01:19:29,450 --> 01:19:33,810
My father would have wanted to hold
a grand wedding for his first born

1369
01:19:34,090 --> 01:19:36,610
I did this without even telling her

1370
01:19:36,650 --> 01:19:38,050
That is my mother's grouse

1371
01:19:38,690 --> 01:19:40,610
Their anger is justified

1372
01:19:41,610 --> 01:19:43,690
I've disappointed them
in all ways possible

1373
01:19:54,489 --> 01:19:56,529
Hello! You've got a courier

1374
01:19:57,770 --> 01:19:59,090
Is anyone home?

1375
01:20:01,610 --> 01:20:03,170
Is Vetrivel there?

1376
01:20:07,090 --> 01:20:09,930
Madam, I've been
yelling my throat hoarse

1377
01:20:09,970 --> 01:20:11,090
Hello!

1378
01:20:12,330 --> 01:20:13,290
You've got a courier

1379
01:20:13,330 --> 01:20:14,850
Please get up
and sign for it

1380
01:20:29,050 --> 01:20:30,570
Is this the teacher's house?

1381
01:20:30,610 --> 01:20:31,770
Don't know

1382
01:20:34,130 --> 01:20:35,170
Vetrivel...?

1383
01:20:36,570 --> 01:20:37,610
I don't know

1384
01:20:39,530 --> 01:20:41,650
Sorry, must be
the next street

1385
01:20:42,650 --> 01:20:44,130
Wait

1386
01:20:44,170 --> 01:20:46,010
That letter is for us

1387
01:20:48,250 --> 01:20:49,730
Please sign

1388
01:20:58,330 --> 01:20:59,530
Thank you

1389
01:21:02,530 --> 01:21:06,090
Won't a girl who eloped
not know her husband's name?

1390
01:21:06,130 --> 01:21:07,770
Is your son's name Vetrivel?

1391
01:21:10,730 --> 01:21:12,650
What are you saying?!

1392
01:21:12,690 --> 01:21:14,450
You don't even know his name?

1393
01:21:14,770 --> 01:21:15,970
No, I don't

1394
01:21:17,716 --> 01:21:19,196
Then how did this happen?

1395
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:37,120
I don't know if it's right
or wrong for me to be here

1396
01:21:37,570 --> 01:21:40,210
But in a close knit family...

1397
01:21:40,330 --> 01:21:42,530
...I can see I'm the cause
of all the problems

1398
01:21:46,130 --> 01:21:47,410
Please forgive me

1399
01:21:51,610 --> 01:21:52,690
Hey, Saradha-

1400
01:21:55,650 --> 01:21:58,010
Where are you going, huh?

1401
01:21:58,530 --> 01:22:00,182
A mother is bound to be
hurt in such a situation

1402
01:22:00,207 --> 01:22:03,407
But we aren't heartless to chase
a girl who has come into our fold

1403
01:22:03,770 --> 01:22:06,050
My son has tied this
sacred thread around your neck

1404
01:22:06,090 --> 01:22:07,370
How can you walk out?

1405
01:22:08,675 --> 01:22:10,155
You are my daughter-in-law

1406
01:22:22,650 --> 01:22:25,930
(traditional lament song)

1407
01:22:44,930 --> 01:22:46,170
Hey old lady!

1408
01:22:46,210 --> 01:22:47,490
Only a wedding
was cancelled

1409
01:22:47,530 --> 01:22:49,330
Not a funeral
So shut up

1410
01:22:53,690 --> 01:22:56,330
Sorry, couldn't come
for your wedding

1411
01:22:56,370 --> 01:22:57,690
Hope it went off well!

1412
01:22:57,730 --> 01:22:58,970
Happy married life dude

1413
01:22:59,010 --> 01:23:00,170
I'll be there next week

1414
01:23:00,210 --> 01:23:01,890
Hello...hello

1415
01:23:08,170 --> 01:23:09,130
Hey! Arul

1416
01:23:09,170 --> 01:23:10,770
Where are you going?

1417
01:23:10,810 --> 01:23:12,410
Why is he angry?

1418
01:23:12,450 --> 01:23:14,490
- Don't know
- What's wrong with him?

1419
01:23:15,090 --> 01:23:16,370
Aunt...!

1420
01:23:17,610 --> 01:23:18,770
What...?

1421
01:23:24,890 --> 01:23:27,050
What's your problem?
Aren't we here for you?

1422
01:23:31,770 --> 01:23:33,130
Spit it out

1423
01:23:33,210 --> 01:23:34,650
Puke

1424
01:23:35,690 --> 01:23:37,250
Cough...spit it out

1425
01:23:53,010 --> 01:23:54,730
All of you step out

1426
01:23:54,890 --> 01:23:56,570
Leave the room

1427
01:24:09,730 --> 01:24:11,450
You want to die?

1428
01:24:13,010 --> 01:24:14,930
Just like your father?

1429
01:24:16,630 --> 01:24:18,550
Your father wasn't man enough

1430
01:24:21,490 --> 01:24:24,330
So ashamed he lost the election
he hung himself to death

1431
01:24:24,783 --> 01:24:26,216
I didn't want the villagers
to think less of him

1432
01:24:26,241 --> 01:24:28,641
I lied to everyone and said
he died of a heart attack

1433
01:24:30,170 --> 01:24:32,610
You've proved you have
your father's genes

1434
01:24:33,170 --> 01:24:35,570
Forgot that this mother
raised you, right?

1435
01:24:38,330 --> 01:24:39,530
Listen to me

1436
01:24:39,570 --> 01:24:40,890
If you are truly my son...

1437
01:24:40,915 --> 01:24:43,435
...chop the head of the chap
who kidnapped your fiancée

1438
01:24:43,460 --> 01:24:45,380
And make that girl a widow

1439
01:24:46,050 --> 01:24:47,770
Then I'll agree you are a man

1440
01:24:55,330 --> 01:24:56,130
Come here

1441
01:24:56,170 --> 01:24:58,370
Keep all this inside
All this is for you

1442
01:24:58,450 --> 01:25:01,130
I don't want so much
Give her also some

1443
01:25:01,177 --> 01:25:03,377
I'm not a stranger
any longer to you

1444
01:25:03,410 --> 01:25:04,610
Call me 'aunt'

1445
01:25:15,290 --> 01:25:18,410
Why didn't you buy
all this a month later?

1446
01:25:22,210 --> 01:25:24,770
They will always compete
with each other

1447
01:25:24,850 --> 01:25:26,090
Come inside

1448
01:25:30,450 --> 01:25:32,210
Which girl did you
plan on kidnapping?

1449
01:25:33,190 --> 01:25:36,210
Without creating a ruckus, I met
the father of the girl you loved

1450
01:25:36,250 --> 01:25:37,690
Do I deserve this?

1451
01:25:38,250 --> 01:25:40,250
It was a case of
mistaken identity

1452
01:25:40,290 --> 01:25:41,730
What if your plan had succeeded?

1453
01:25:41,825 --> 01:25:43,910
'I explained it to you civilly
What happened to your brains?'

1454
01:25:43,935 --> 01:25:46,535
If the President asked me this
how can I face him?

1455
01:25:50,490 --> 01:25:52,730
Till this very minute
I have led a dignified life

1456
01:25:52,810 --> 01:25:54,890
Hereafter don't make me
bow my head in shame

1457
01:26:11,930 --> 01:26:13,330
What are you saying, Subha?

1458
01:26:13,930 --> 01:26:16,090
My family has fixed
my engagement date

1459
01:26:16,170 --> 01:26:17,890
Please do something, Saravana

1460
01:26:17,970 --> 01:26:19,450
Are you trying to be funny?

1461
01:26:19,490 --> 01:26:20,610
You won't elope with me

1462
01:26:20,690 --> 01:26:21,970
Nor will you stop the marriage

1463
01:26:22,050 --> 01:26:24,650
If you keep asking me to
do something, what can I do?

1464
01:26:26,450 --> 01:26:29,290
Girls would like to play it safe
but we boys have to do everything!

1465
01:26:29,370 --> 01:26:30,770
Because you were so stubborn...

1466
01:26:30,810 --> 01:26:32,410
...my brother lost
the girl he loved

1467
01:26:33,890 --> 01:26:36,170
If we had agreed to elope
we wouldn't be in this mess now

1468
01:26:36,210 --> 01:26:39,210
You'll come up with 101 excuses
saying your father's prestige is at stake

1469
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:40,410
Please try to understand-

1470
01:26:40,450 --> 01:26:41,370
Don't touch me!

1471
01:26:41,410 --> 01:26:42,610
Move aside

1472
01:26:43,050 --> 01:26:46,210
You'll hug, kiss, ask me to
do something and you'll go

1473
01:27:01,290 --> 01:27:02,530
Don't cry, Subha

1474
01:27:02,770 --> 01:27:03,890
Sorry

1475
01:27:04,850 --> 01:27:06,170
Didn't I apologize?

1476
01:27:10,690 --> 01:27:12,330
Bro, I've got your
fertilizer consignment

1477
01:27:12,370 --> 01:27:13,650
Will you come to the shop?

1478
01:27:13,730 --> 01:27:14,970
From Ramachandran

1479
01:27:15,050 --> 01:27:17,010
Why did you bring it
at this time of night?

1480
01:27:17,050 --> 01:27:18,610
I have a delivery
to make in Pudhukottai

1481
01:27:18,650 --> 01:27:20,730
On the way I thought
I'll deliver this too

1482
01:27:21,090 --> 01:27:22,570
Okay, I'll come

1483
01:27:55,410 --> 01:27:56,610
Go, get him

1484
01:27:58,450 --> 01:27:59,650
Don't miss

1485
01:28:03,370 --> 01:28:04,450
Kill him

1486
01:29:29,730 --> 01:29:30,850
Who sent you?

1487
01:29:30,930 --> 01:29:31,970
Tell me

1488
01:30:02,490 --> 01:30:04,210
Let go of him

1489
01:30:15,890 --> 01:30:20,090
I know how hurt you'll be
because I married your fiancée

1490
01:30:20,450 --> 01:30:22,210
But I didn't come to abduct her

1491
01:30:23,370 --> 01:30:26,250
It was another girl from your village
whom my brother is in love with

1492
01:30:26,450 --> 01:30:29,090
I wanted to explain all this
and ask for your forgiveness

1493
01:30:29,187 --> 01:30:31,530
But you were in too much
of a hurry and sent your men

1494
01:30:40,290 --> 01:30:44,730
Hey! Stop sending your men
or slicing my neck with a sickle

1495
01:30:44,825 --> 01:30:46,505
If you try your tricks again...

1496
01:30:46,530 --> 01:30:48,250
...you'll only pick the sickle

1497
01:30:48,290 --> 01:30:49,930
I'll be the one
to chop your neck

1498
01:31:03,450 --> 01:31:11,210
"Scented jasmine, cherished flower
My prince gets intoxicated for sure"

1499
01:31:12,210 --> 01:31:13,330
Hello, Jaggery-head

1500
01:31:13,370 --> 01:31:15,290
- How are you?
- Getting along, bro

1501
01:31:15,410 --> 01:31:17,490
It's only been 4 months
since you got married

1502
01:31:17,530 --> 01:31:18,921
And you're fed up
with life already

1503
01:31:18,946 --> 01:31:20,306
Don't rub salt on to the wound

1504
01:31:20,331 --> 01:31:22,291
I'm wondering
why I got married!

1505
01:31:22,316 --> 01:31:24,436
Is your wife creating problems?

1506
01:31:24,469 --> 01:31:26,589
Only if she's with me
that question will arise

1507
01:31:26,614 --> 01:31:28,014
Where did she go?

1508
01:31:28,055 --> 01:31:30,775
The day after we got married...

1509
01:31:31,010 --> 01:31:34,090
...she was sent back to her house
because it's an inauspicious month!

1510
01:31:34,170 --> 01:31:37,570
That's a tradition we follow for
generations, part of our culture

1511
01:31:37,610 --> 01:31:38,850
My wife Vaadamalli also went

1512
01:31:38,890 --> 01:31:40,690
But by mid august
she would have come back

1513
01:31:40,715 --> 01:31:44,807
My father made me take
a celibate vow to go to Sabarimala

1514
01:31:44,918 --> 01:31:47,718
Whatever your father does
will be only for your good

1515
01:31:47,743 --> 01:31:48,983
What about mid September?

1516
01:31:49,008 --> 01:31:52,608
After September 15th her father
made her take a celibate vow

1517
01:31:52,890 --> 01:31:55,130
And packed her off to
some other sacred hill!

1518
01:31:55,210 --> 01:31:57,875
Looks like both fathers were
in cahoots with each other

1519
01:31:58,062 --> 01:32:00,222
What about October then?

1520
01:32:00,450 --> 01:32:02,770
She delivered
a baby by then!

1521
01:32:03,410 --> 01:32:05,730
The sun rises in the west!

1522
01:32:06,185 --> 01:32:07,785
Only 4 months
since he married her

1523
01:32:07,810 --> 01:32:10,147
From what he says, he wouldn't
have even laid his finger on her

1524
01:32:10,172 --> 01:32:11,932
- How is that possible?
- Exactly

1525
01:32:12,139 --> 01:32:13,539
That's what I asked too

1526
01:32:13,564 --> 01:32:18,764
My father-in-law's brother accused me
of suspecting my wife and clobbered me

1527
01:32:19,970 --> 01:32:21,290
Where are you off to now?

1528
01:32:21,370 --> 01:32:22,930
Taking post-natal
diet food for my wife

1529
01:32:22,970 --> 01:32:23,810
Post-natal care

1530
01:32:23,850 --> 01:32:24,890
You bus is here

1531
01:32:24,970 --> 01:32:26,330
I'll take leave, bro

1532
01:32:28,599 --> 01:32:30,879
If his father-in-law's brother
hit him black and blue...

1533
01:32:30,904 --> 01:32:32,704
...who could have
fathered the baby?

1534
01:32:32,970 --> 01:32:35,690
He wasn't cautious like me
and now he has lost his wife

1535
01:32:36,210 --> 01:32:37,650
- Morning, madam
- Good morning

1536
01:32:37,681 --> 01:32:39,530
- Which is Vetrivel's shop?
- That's the one

1537
01:32:39,558 --> 01:32:40,918
See you, madam

1538
01:32:44,410 --> 01:32:45,410
Bro...?

1539
01:32:48,090 --> 01:32:49,170
Hi

1540
01:33:06,170 --> 01:33:08,890
I had made up my mind
I would marry only you

1541
01:33:09,490 --> 01:33:13,130
But because of my mistake
the whole village abandoned her

1542
01:33:13,930 --> 01:33:15,490
I didn't have any other choice

1543
01:33:17,530 --> 01:33:19,650
But I married her
after giving it deep thought

1544
01:33:20,130 --> 01:33:21,890
Hereafter my life will be like this

1545
01:33:23,890 --> 01:33:25,570
I hope you'll understand

1546
01:33:33,490 --> 01:33:38,010
'I just married her, but I will
love you for the rest of my life'

1547
01:33:38,090 --> 01:33:40,250
It would've been a mistake
only if you had said this

1548
01:33:42,170 --> 01:33:43,450
I can understand

1549
01:33:46,370 --> 01:33:51,570
There was a reason why we both
didn't share what we truly felt

1550
01:33:53,970 --> 01:33:55,810
We should accept it was
for a good cause

1551
01:34:01,810 --> 01:34:02,810
And forget

1552
01:34:04,970 --> 01:34:06,570
I'll definitely...

1553
01:34:08,010 --> 01:34:09,370
...try my best

1554
01:34:54,730 --> 01:34:56,370
Coming Wednesday
is an auspicious day

1555
01:34:56,450 --> 01:34:57,410
You can fix that date

1556
01:34:57,490 --> 01:34:59,010
Check if Sunday is good?

1557
01:34:59,090 --> 01:35:00,490
- That's a bad day
- What's up?

1558
01:35:00,515 --> 01:35:02,995
He's looking for a good day
to hold a formal reception

1559
01:35:03,050 --> 01:35:05,210
For people to spit on my face?

1560
01:35:07,010 --> 01:35:09,690
Won't folks spit on your face
for what you've already done?

1561
01:35:09,730 --> 01:35:11,690
I just can't do all that

1562
01:35:14,450 --> 01:35:18,010
Won't we want to see you married
formally, with garlands, feast etc?

1563
01:35:18,090 --> 01:35:20,423
If that's your wish,
go and get a garland

1564
01:35:20,448 --> 01:35:22,168
You can see us
wear it around our necks

1565
01:35:22,193 --> 01:35:24,953
So will he keep the girl he brought
in the kitchen all the time?

1566
01:35:25,170 --> 01:35:27,290
In future when we take her out...

1567
01:35:27,330 --> 01:35:29,890
...people will malign her
saying she eloped with you

1568
01:35:29,970 --> 01:35:31,210
Sir may not mind it

1569
01:35:31,250 --> 01:35:33,130
But we'll feel like
committing suicide!

1570
01:35:34,130 --> 01:35:38,250
My first born, aren't we
blessed to see even this?

1571
01:35:46,890 --> 01:35:48,330
Okay, go ahead

1572
01:35:49,850 --> 01:35:52,010
'Vetrivel weds Latha'

1573
01:36:01,730 --> 01:36:03,930
I didn't know
they were your sons

1574
01:36:04,010 --> 01:36:06,570
They came to invite me
for a Sports day celebration

1575
01:36:06,650 --> 01:36:09,450
Look how they have come into
our village and done this

1576
01:36:10,429 --> 01:36:11,749
It was wrong on their part

1577
01:36:12,730 --> 01:36:16,490
Even if he lets me down as a son
I shouldn't do the same as a father, right?

1578
01:36:16,530 --> 01:36:18,010
That's why I am arranging it

1579
01:36:18,850 --> 01:36:20,930
The wedding hall will be
filled with our guests

1580
01:36:20,970 --> 01:36:24,330
If her friends or family attended
I thought she would feel glad

1581
01:36:24,730 --> 01:36:27,010
But I don't know
any of her relatives

1582
01:36:27,050 --> 01:36:29,650
That's why I thought
if you attended the function-

1583
01:36:34,650 --> 01:36:36,250
Okay, I'll come

1584
01:36:37,850 --> 01:36:39,170
Come with your family

1585
01:36:39,890 --> 01:36:41,890
That will be insulting
the whole village

1586
01:36:42,370 --> 01:36:43,370
I will come

1587
01:36:44,010 --> 01:36:45,330
As your friend

1588
01:36:46,130 --> 01:36:47,690
'Vetrivel weds Latha'

1589
01:36:51,730 --> 01:36:52,970
Welcome

1590
01:36:53,690 --> 01:36:56,010
Please come

1591
01:36:56,050 --> 01:36:58,850
As long as we are alive
love won't die

1592
01:37:00,970 --> 01:37:02,090
Not again!

1593
01:37:04,930 --> 01:37:06,850
She was to be kidnapped
for the younger brother

1594
01:37:06,890 --> 01:37:08,850
But she is now
the elder brother's wife!

1595
01:37:08,890 --> 01:37:10,890
- Keep quiet
- This is not right

1596
01:37:11,145 --> 01:37:11,945
I won't accept

1597
01:37:11,970 --> 01:37:13,405
- He'll beat you to a pulp
- Okay, fine

1598
01:37:13,430 --> 01:37:14,790
If he doesn't thrash you, I will

1599
01:37:14,815 --> 01:37:16,695
- You will hit, huh?
- You think I won’t?

1600
01:37:16,720 --> 01:37:17,440
Why this rage?

1601
01:37:17,465 --> 01:37:19,065
Thank God you kidnapped
the wrong girl

1602
01:37:19,166 --> 01:37:20,286
Close shave!

1603
01:37:20,311 --> 01:37:22,791
If you had got the right girl
I won't be sitting here like this

1604
01:37:22,816 --> 01:37:25,136
- What will you do sitting here?
- Don't change the topic

1605
01:37:25,410 --> 01:37:28,171
You messed up, right?
You call yourself professionals?

1606
01:37:28,196 --> 01:37:29,651
You might as well
change your profession

1607
01:37:29,676 --> 01:37:33,516
- We decided this long ago
- Go ahead and do so

1608
01:37:33,730 --> 01:37:34,530
But...?

1609
01:37:34,570 --> 01:37:35,659
What's but and if?

1610
01:37:35,684 --> 01:37:38,364
I've given my word
I'll kidnap a girl 1 last time

1611
01:37:38,570 --> 01:37:39,490
Which village?

1612
01:37:39,530 --> 01:37:40,330
Madhukur

1613
01:37:40,410 --> 01:37:42,010
That's my village
Who is the girl?

1614
01:37:42,170 --> 01:37:43,530
In that village-

1615
01:37:43,748 --> 01:37:46,508
From toddlers to old hags
I tailor all their dresses

1616
01:37:46,533 --> 01:37:49,385
Just tell me her name
I'll help you keep up your promise

1617
01:37:49,410 --> 01:37:51,650
4 men want me
to kidnap 1 girl

1618
01:37:51,730 --> 01:37:53,850
I'm confused as to
which of the 4 to oblige

1619
01:37:53,890 --> 01:37:54,810
Why be confused?

1620
01:37:54,850 --> 01:37:57,170
Ask that girl whom she prefers
Take her straight to that chap

1621
01:37:57,210 --> 01:37:58,370
That's the law!

1622
01:37:58,450 --> 01:37:59,610
Will you ask her
and let me know?

1623
01:37:59,690 --> 01:38:00,410
Tell me her name

1624
01:38:00,490 --> 01:38:01,690
Vaadamalli

1625
01:38:02,490 --> 01:38:03,570
See you

1626
01:38:04,130 --> 01:38:05,170
Good evening

1627
01:38:08,050 --> 01:38:08,850
Sorry, pal

1628
01:38:08,890 --> 01:38:10,090
Actually the other night-

1629
01:38:13,090 --> 01:38:15,130
Hey! Click a photo fast

1630
01:38:18,570 --> 01:38:20,530
Give this to him later

1631
01:38:23,290 --> 01:38:24,770
Go in, machan

1632
01:38:26,050 --> 01:38:27,570
He is here

1633
01:38:27,989 --> 01:38:29,330
- Come, welcome
- Greetings

1634
01:38:29,440 --> 01:38:31,800
I am so glad you made it
Please come in

1635
01:38:31,825 --> 01:38:32,785
Move a little closer

1636
01:38:32,825 --> 01:38:34,505
Is everything going on fine?

1637
01:38:34,530 --> 01:38:36,050
Hey Saradha!
President of Naatuchalai

1638
01:38:36,090 --> 01:38:36,810
My wife

1639
01:38:36,850 --> 01:38:38,690
- Greetings
- So glad you could come

1640
01:38:39,490 --> 01:38:40,450
Hello, sir

1641
01:38:43,135 --> 01:38:45,615
You belong to my village
Earn a good name in this family

1642
01:38:45,704 --> 01:38:47,104
Give him the sacred ash

1643
01:38:48,570 --> 01:38:49,970
May you be happy

1644
01:38:51,610 --> 01:38:52,690
May you be happy, son

1645
01:39:06,931 --> 01:39:08,410
Hey! Get my mat also

1646
01:39:08,450 --> 01:39:10,370
Why are you going up?

1647
01:39:10,410 --> 01:39:11,770
You should be going in there

1648
01:39:11,810 --> 01:39:14,530
It's not even a month
since her father passed away

1649
01:39:14,570 --> 01:39:17,410
I'm already a sinner for having
married her right after his demise

1650
01:39:17,450 --> 01:39:19,210
Wedding night is
last on my list now

1651
01:39:20,679 --> 01:39:22,279
Is she a woman
or an inanimate doll?

1652
01:39:22,304 --> 01:39:24,224
Your parents are brainless

1653
01:39:24,249 --> 01:39:25,689
What happened to your brains?

1654
01:39:26,370 --> 01:39:27,610
Poor soul!

1655
01:39:36,050 --> 01:39:40,410
"You are the Lord all encompassing
You are the auspicious beginning"

1656
01:39:40,490 --> 01:39:44,930
"You are the enlightened light
The aura that shines always bright"

1657
01:39:44,970 --> 01:39:49,450
"I came here to you for shelter
My savior, lord and master"

1658
01:39:49,490 --> 01:39:53,770
"One who swallowed poison
to save mankind from destruction"

1659
01:39:53,850 --> 01:39:55,810
"My salvation"

1660
01:40:02,810 --> 01:40:06,770
"No one as awesome as you
I've ever met, my beau"

1661
01:40:06,810 --> 01:40:11,410
"Looking at you tall and dynamic
even the spacious sky may shrink"

1662
01:40:11,690 --> 01:40:15,690
"No one as handsome as you
I've ever met my whole life through"

1663
01:40:15,730 --> 01:40:20,810
"Looking at your height, I confess
even the endless sky may compress"

1664
01:40:21,130 --> 01:40:25,250
"You entered my life like divinity
Even before I asked, you blessed me"

1665
01:40:25,370 --> 01:40:29,250
"Golden hearted soul that you are
I worship you, no holds barred"

1666
01:40:29,330 --> 01:40:33,890
"How many ever births, you and me
together we will always be"

1667
01:40:33,970 --> 01:40:38,170
"No one as humane as you
I've ever met, whole life through"

1668
01:40:38,210 --> 01:40:43,210
"Looking at you, tall and gentlemanly
even the vast sky may diminish gently"

1669
01:40:52,050 --> 01:40:53,290
Where did you go?

1670
01:40:53,330 --> 01:40:54,410
To do the funeral rites

1671
01:40:54,450 --> 01:40:56,690
When we are both alive
whom did he do last rites for?

1672
01:40:56,770 --> 01:40:57,650
My father-in-law

1673
01:40:57,690 --> 01:40:59,610
Shouldn't his son be
the one to do that ritual?

1674
01:41:00,770 --> 01:41:02,410
Son-in-law can also do it

1675
01:41:11,050 --> 01:41:13,450
You're going out of your way

1676
01:41:13,490 --> 01:41:15,530
But why are you still
keeping her at a distance?

1677
01:41:16,490 --> 01:41:17,930
When did I isolate her?

1678
01:41:17,970 --> 01:41:19,170
I'm the one maintaining my distance

1679
01:41:19,210 --> 01:41:20,410
That's what I am asking you

1680
01:41:20,450 --> 01:41:23,330
Did I unite Saravana
with the girl he loves?

1681
01:41:24,290 --> 01:41:26,450
Then how can we alone
be blissfully happy?

1682
01:41:27,450 --> 01:41:29,490
She has understood me very well

1683
01:41:29,530 --> 01:41:31,890
You're the one unnecessarily
complicating this issue

1684
01:41:35,490 --> 01:41:39,810
"My heart must have been beating
Waiting for you, regularly greeting"

1685
01:41:39,930 --> 01:41:44,410
"Unknowing, of its own accord
within you it touched a chord"

1686
01:41:44,450 --> 01:41:48,890
"When I was standing forlorn
my life bleak, no one to belong"

1687
01:41:48,930 --> 01:41:52,890
"You were my savior-compatriot
Hoisted me into a pearled chariot"

1688
01:41:52,970 --> 01:41:57,130
"With just a single word
you made me your world"

1689
01:41:57,210 --> 01:42:04,250
"4,320,000,000 years and more is our bond
It has crossed time, space and beyond"

1690
01:42:04,330 --> 01:42:08,210
"No one as awesome as you
I've ever met, my love true"

1691
01:42:08,290 --> 01:42:13,090
"Looking at you tall and dynamic
even the spacious sky may shrink"

1692
01:42:13,290 --> 01:42:17,290
"No one as handsome as you
I've ever met my whole life through"

1693
01:42:17,330 --> 01:42:22,010
"Looking at your height, I confess
even the endless sky may compress"

1694
01:42:39,650 --> 01:42:41,610
The wedding decoration
should be A-1

1695
01:42:41,650 --> 01:42:42,290
Okay, chief

1696
01:42:42,370 --> 01:42:46,610
There should be enough chairs
Guests shouldn't stand

1697
01:42:49,330 --> 01:42:51,530
I'll call you
when it is all finalized

1698
01:42:51,570 --> 01:42:53,290
I need to talk to you

1699
01:42:53,930 --> 01:42:56,610
Your nephew wants to talk to you

1700
01:42:58,650 --> 01:43:00,770
I know my mother
and you don't get along

1701
01:43:00,850 --> 01:43:02,570
But I have nothing against you

1702
01:43:02,610 --> 01:43:04,450
Even now I heard something

1703
01:43:04,490 --> 01:43:06,450
But if I keep quiet
and not tell you...

1704
01:43:06,490 --> 01:43:09,330
...knowing it concerns you
it won't be right on my part

1705
01:43:09,877 --> 01:43:12,117
You know Vetrivel kidnapped Latha
at the temple festival

1706
01:43:12,142 --> 01:43:14,582
He didn't intend
kidnapping Latha

1707
01:43:14,607 --> 01:43:16,287
He had planned to
kidnap your daughter

1708
01:43:23,650 --> 01:43:25,930
I wanted to ask you something
That's why I sent for you

1709
01:43:25,970 --> 01:43:26,730
Please tell me

1710
01:43:26,770 --> 01:43:31,210
It seems at the temple festival
your sons planned to kidnap my daughter

1711
01:43:35,570 --> 01:43:36,930
Are you aware of that?

1712
01:43:38,530 --> 01:43:40,010
You knew about it

1713
01:43:40,050 --> 01:43:41,210
But you didn't tell me

1714
01:43:41,850 --> 01:43:43,090
Am I right?

1715
01:43:43,232 --> 01:43:45,472
You came and invited me
ever so magnanimously

1716
01:43:45,536 --> 01:43:48,536
You could have told me
at least then, right?

1717
01:43:49,730 --> 01:43:51,410
Hey! Rascal

1718
01:43:52,930 --> 01:43:55,370
How many times I've told you
to serve tea to the guest first?

1719
01:43:55,535 --> 01:43:57,935
If I tell you once,
won't it enter your thick skull?

1720
01:43:58,530 --> 01:44:01,130
Learn whom you should treat
with respect and how

1721
01:44:01,170 --> 01:44:02,130
Get lost!

1722
01:44:09,130 --> 01:44:10,210
Please drink your tea

1723
01:44:11,610 --> 01:44:14,170
Next week my daughter
is getting engaged

1724
01:44:14,250 --> 01:44:16,170
Very soon she will be married

1725
01:44:16,690 --> 01:44:19,050
Don't think I'm sharing this
out of respect for you

1726
01:44:19,970 --> 01:44:22,330
If my dignity is at stake...

1727
01:44:22,410 --> 01:44:24,970
...I won't hesitate resorting
to pulling their insides out

1728
01:44:27,810 --> 01:44:29,530
Warn your sons

1729
01:44:29,570 --> 01:44:31,370
Where is your son?

1730
01:44:31,410 --> 01:44:32,650
Why?

1731
01:44:32,690 --> 01:44:34,170
What happened?

1732
01:44:34,210 --> 01:44:35,090
Tell me

1733
01:44:35,170 --> 01:44:36,770
Hey! How dare you-

1734
01:44:38,930 --> 01:44:40,490
Let go of my hand
I will kill you

1735
01:44:40,570 --> 01:44:41,850
Why are you hitting him?

1736
01:44:41,930 --> 01:44:42,730
Let go

1737
01:44:42,770 --> 01:44:44,050
Why are you hitting him?

1738
01:44:44,145 --> 01:44:47,545
For having raised him and made him a man
he has honored me with a good name

1739
01:44:47,570 --> 01:44:48,970
I'm hitting him
with all that joy!

1740
01:44:49,010 --> 01:44:50,050
- Rascal!
- Stop it

1741
01:44:50,130 --> 01:44:52,050
Listen to me

1742
01:44:56,970 --> 01:44:58,010
Go in, dear

1743
01:44:58,050 --> 01:44:59,050
I just wanted to-

1744
01:44:59,090 --> 01:45:00,290
Go inside

1745
01:45:02,130 --> 01:45:04,930
At least you listen to me
Please go inside

1746
01:45:08,050 --> 01:45:09,570
What's wrong with you?

1747
01:45:09,610 --> 01:45:10,970
What can get worse than this?

1748
01:45:11,010 --> 01:45:12,230
My reputation, dignity
vanished into thin air

1749
01:45:12,255 --> 01:45:14,175
I teach my students
lessons usually

1750
01:45:14,262 --> 01:45:15,942
Today someone else
is teaching me a lesson

1751
01:45:15,967 --> 01:45:17,911
All...all because of him

1752
01:45:18,022 --> 01:45:20,742
Next week his daughter
is getting engaged

1753
01:45:20,922 --> 01:45:23,602
If your sons go and
create a ruckus there...

1754
01:45:23,627 --> 01:45:25,267
...you won't see me alive

1755
01:45:53,490 --> 01:45:55,290
Are you still upset?

1756
01:46:01,490 --> 01:46:04,050
Isn't your father justified
in being mad at you about this?

1757
01:46:04,570 --> 01:46:06,210
Not because he hit me

1758
01:46:06,730 --> 01:46:09,130
I love Subha
with all my heart

1759
01:46:09,664 --> 01:46:13,264
But when I think of how much I have
ruined the peace of mind of everyone

1760
01:46:13,930 --> 01:46:16,250
...I hate myself

1761
01:46:16,290 --> 01:46:18,690
Even I thought in 1 single day
my whole life was in shambles

1762
01:46:18,730 --> 01:46:21,330
But even if my father had
found a groom for me...

1763
01:46:21,370 --> 01:46:23,770
...I don't think I could have
been luckier than this!

1764
01:46:23,810 --> 01:46:25,210
Don't lose heart

1765
01:46:25,250 --> 01:46:26,730
You'll also find
your peace of mind

1766
01:46:29,337 --> 01:46:30,496
Whoever opposes you...

1767
01:46:30,521 --> 01:46:32,161
...your brother
will be by your side

1768
01:46:35,034 --> 01:46:36,490
When my son was born...

1769
01:46:36,530 --> 01:46:39,650
...we celebrated with offerings
to our family deity in grand style

1770
01:46:39,690 --> 01:46:41,930
After 27 years we have come here

1771
01:46:41,988 --> 01:46:45,330
...as thanksgiving to the same God
for the 1st auspicious event in our family

1772
01:46:45,370 --> 01:46:47,210
We have hardly finished thanking

1773
01:46:47,250 --> 01:46:50,130
And you come here asking me
to cancel the engagement

1774
01:46:51,250 --> 01:46:55,130
Is Rajamanickam aware your brother
is in love with his daughter?

1775
01:46:57,650 --> 01:46:59,970
It's not only the taste that counts

1776
01:47:00,010 --> 01:47:02,450
All the guests should be
looked after very well

1777
01:47:02,530 --> 01:47:05,930
Those who eat our feast should talk
about our wedding for a whole week

1778
01:47:05,970 --> 01:47:06,690
Okay...?

1779
01:47:06,770 --> 01:47:08,450
We will do as per your wish, sir

1780
01:47:08,930 --> 01:47:10,250
My groom's father is on the line

1781
01:47:10,290 --> 01:47:11,970
I'll fix the wedding date
and let you know

1782
01:47:12,010 --> 01:47:13,050
You can leave now

1783
01:47:13,090 --> 01:47:13,810
I'll be back

1784
01:47:13,850 --> 01:47:15,290
Hello 'sammandhi'

1785
01:47:15,360 --> 01:47:18,960
Wedding preparations
are in full swing

1786
01:47:18,985 --> 01:47:21,505
We've got the best wedding hall
Spoke to the best cook in town

1787
01:47:21,530 --> 01:47:24,330
I'll pay the advance
as soon as the date is fixed

1788
01:47:24,410 --> 01:47:25,250
What about your side?

1789
01:47:25,290 --> 01:47:26,490
I want to ask you something

1790
01:47:26,530 --> 01:47:28,970
It seems your daughter
is in love with some chap

1791
01:47:32,705 --> 01:47:33,545
Tell me

1792
01:47:33,570 --> 01:47:37,530
Did you think you could hide everything
and conduct this wedding, Rajamanickam?

1793
01:47:38,905 --> 01:47:40,050
Can we talk in person please?

1794
01:47:40,090 --> 01:47:42,050
Is there anything left to discuss?

1795
01:47:42,090 --> 01:47:45,610
I have no problem telling you
what really happened, sir

1796
01:47:46,090 --> 01:47:50,130
I spoke to that boy's father
and cleared everything

1797
01:47:50,610 --> 01:47:53,170
You cleared everything
with the father

1798
01:47:53,250 --> 01:47:56,410
What about your daughter?
She also reciprocated his love!

1799
01:47:56,450 --> 01:47:59,010
My daughter won't go against
my wish the way you think-

1800
01:47:59,250 --> 01:48:02,090
Forced marriage won't work
This is a different era altogether

1801
01:48:02,115 --> 01:48:03,465
Even if you thought so...

1802
01:48:03,606 --> 01:48:05,286
...why should my son
be the scapegoat?

1803
01:48:05,311 --> 01:48:07,991
Look for another alliance
suitable to your status!

1804
01:48:08,290 --> 01:48:09,730
Hello...hello

1805
01:48:24,690 --> 01:48:27,890
Deivanai, they asked me
to cancel the wedding

1806
01:48:33,841 --> 01:48:36,561
Don't think she is
calm and submissive

1807
01:48:37,290 --> 01:48:39,250
She is the sole reason
for this cancellation

1808
01:48:39,746 --> 01:48:42,130
She...she is up to something

1809
01:48:42,210 --> 01:48:44,170
I have nothing to do
with this calling off

1810
01:48:44,330 --> 01:48:45,449
It is happening
of its own accord

1811
01:48:45,542 --> 01:48:47,902
Don't pull words
out of my mouth

1812
01:48:48,130 --> 01:48:50,270
Didn't you plan to elope
on the temple festival day?

1813
01:48:50,332 --> 01:48:54,572
You just assume something and
come to your own wrong conclusions

1814
01:48:54,730 --> 01:48:56,330
When Saravana's father
spoke to you...

1815
01:48:56,370 --> 01:48:58,610
...you may have had 100 reasons
for rejecting his proposal

1816
01:48:58,650 --> 01:49:02,012
But when he asked me to elope
I refused based on only 1 reason

1817
01:49:02,092 --> 01:49:03,572
Both of you

1818
01:49:05,122 --> 01:49:07,970
Though you were preparing
for my wedding so eagerly...

1819
01:49:08,010 --> 01:49:09,850
...I was cool and collected
only because of my intuition

1820
01:49:09,875 --> 01:49:11,635
I was sure all this
won't materialize

1821
01:49:12,010 --> 01:49:14,530
But let me tell you this today
When I marry...

1822
01:49:14,570 --> 01:49:15,970
...Saravanan will be the groom

1823
01:49:16,010 --> 01:49:17,690
That too with your consent

1824
01:49:23,735 --> 01:49:27,535
Don't get me wrong
Will you take a decision soon?

1825
01:49:27,560 --> 01:49:29,560
Or keep your daughter at home
and keep protecting her?

1826
01:49:29,585 --> 01:49:32,185
Our society is unaware
of the news we know

1827
01:49:32,295 --> 01:49:34,335
A daughter should be married
well within the right time

1828
01:49:34,360 --> 01:49:38,960
Why don't you get Subha married
to your sister's son Arul?

1829
01:49:41,250 --> 01:49:44,530
Wondering if your hot-tempered sister
will take good care of your daughter?

1830
01:49:44,814 --> 01:49:46,065
Arul is a good fellow

1831
01:49:46,533 --> 01:49:49,530
Didn't he forget all the feud and
stand by you in your time of need?

1832
01:49:49,570 --> 01:49:53,210
This way you can patch up
the long drawn family feud too

1833
01:49:53,250 --> 01:49:55,730
Your sister's lifeline is shaky

1834
01:49:55,925 --> 01:49:58,605
Instead of standing at her funeral
as one among the crowd...

1835
01:49:58,630 --> 01:50:02,150
...it makes sense to be part of
her family through marriage ties

1836
01:50:02,175 --> 01:50:04,855
You come over
I'll take care of the rest

1837
01:50:21,170 --> 01:50:22,730
Come in

1838
01:50:24,330 --> 01:50:25,530
Hey Arul, call your uncle in

1839
01:50:25,570 --> 01:50:27,250
Hello, uncle
Come in, aunt

1840
01:50:28,730 --> 01:50:32,250
Welcome, it has been decades
since you stepped into our house

1841
01:50:35,410 --> 01:50:36,810
Come in, uncle

1842
01:50:36,850 --> 01:50:37,650
Please come in

1843
01:50:37,690 --> 01:50:38,930
Please be seated

1844
01:50:49,130 --> 01:50:50,290
Devanai

1845
01:50:52,730 --> 01:50:53,810
Here, sister-in-law

1846
01:50:56,210 --> 01:50:57,730
Why are you hesitating?

1847
01:50:57,770 --> 01:51:02,410
Talk, clear the air
and call it a truce

1848
01:51:04,880 --> 01:51:06,760
Take the packet of salt as truce

1849
01:51:13,010 --> 01:51:15,079
Grandma, look who is here

1850
01:51:15,465 --> 01:51:18,065
Our village president
has come to visit us

1851
01:51:18,090 --> 01:51:20,650
Have you come to send me off
on my final journey?

1852
01:51:21,290 --> 01:51:25,170
I am worried I'll die before
my grandson finds a good wife

1853
01:51:25,410 --> 01:51:28,690
Will you consent to your daughter
becoming my grandson's wife...

1854
01:51:28,769 --> 01:51:31,409
...and make me die peacefully?

1855
01:51:37,567 --> 01:51:40,487
Kayavarnam, they have come
all this way to patch up the feud

1856
01:51:40,512 --> 01:51:41,872
Why are you hesitating?

1857
01:51:43,972 --> 01:51:45,265
What are you thinking about?

1858
01:51:45,290 --> 01:51:46,570
At least say 'yes' or 'no'

1859
01:51:46,610 --> 01:51:49,290
Didn't she accept the salt handed
to her now true to our custom?

1860
01:51:50,285 --> 01:51:51,250
Then why this silence?

1861
01:51:51,330 --> 01:51:52,690
That is equal to consent

1862
01:51:57,583 --> 01:52:00,170
Fix a good date and
let them get engaged

1863
01:52:00,195 --> 01:52:01,835
Why do we have to
fix a good date?

1864
01:52:01,930 --> 01:52:04,090
Everyday is a good day
when it comes to a joyous event

1865
01:52:04,130 --> 01:52:06,890
Periyayi, get the tray with
betel leaves to seal the pact

1866
01:52:06,930 --> 01:52:10,690
Your wish has come true
You're happy now?

1867
01:52:24,730 --> 01:52:26,690
How dare you come here!

1868
01:52:26,770 --> 01:52:28,330
Bro, don't

1869
01:52:28,370 --> 01:52:29,130
Don't lose your cool-

1870
01:52:29,170 --> 01:52:30,170
Let go of me

1871
01:52:30,195 --> 01:52:32,315
If your anger will dissipate
only if you hit me, go ahead

1872
01:52:32,340 --> 01:52:34,100
But first please hear me out

1873
01:52:34,250 --> 01:52:37,570
This caste issue and false prestige
is making you take rash decisions

1874
01:52:37,610 --> 01:52:38,810
Whatever it is, think calmly

1875
01:52:39,096 --> 01:52:40,971
Just for your self-satisfaction,
if you get your daughter married...

1876
01:52:40,996 --> 01:52:42,796
...to a man she doesn't like
she won't be happy

1877
01:52:43,170 --> 01:52:44,244
So why go ahead
with this alliance?

1878
01:52:44,269 --> 01:52:46,309
Who are you to preach to me?

1879
01:52:46,490 --> 01:52:48,010
I know what's good and bad for me

1880
01:52:48,050 --> 01:52:48,890
GO

1881
01:52:48,930 --> 01:52:51,610
If this is your final decision
then please hear mine

1882
01:52:51,635 --> 01:52:53,435
Only my brother will
marry your daughter

1883
01:52:53,490 --> 01:52:55,050
You go ahead and
do what you want

1884
01:53:01,730 --> 01:53:03,650
You can think twice
if it is a stranger's house

1885
01:53:03,690 --> 01:53:05,650
Why hesitate to come here?

1886
01:53:06,547 --> 01:53:08,970
Anyway she will come here
very soon as my daughter-in-law

1887
01:53:09,010 --> 01:53:11,410
What's wrong if she comes here
a few days earlier?

1888
01:53:12,490 --> 01:53:15,410
Hey betel-leaf box!
Bring my daughter-in-law here

1889
01:53:15,450 --> 01:53:17,610
And ask my brother to attend
to the wedding preparations

1890
01:53:17,877 --> 01:53:20,557
When I am here
let me see what they can do

1891
01:54:39,690 --> 01:54:41,730
Have my sons created
any problem for you?

1892
01:54:41,770 --> 01:54:44,370
Nothing of that sort

1893
01:54:44,673 --> 01:54:46,280
You've come here
at this late hour

1894
01:54:46,305 --> 01:54:48,385
I have come
to ask you a favor

1895
01:54:48,410 --> 01:54:49,370
Favor...?

1896
01:54:49,770 --> 01:54:54,050
I was so selfish, steeped in
false notions of caste and prestige

1897
01:54:54,810 --> 01:54:57,370
I didn't give a thought
to my daughter's happiness

1898
01:54:57,450 --> 01:54:58,810
What happened?

1899
01:55:01,290 --> 01:55:02,370
Our chief is here

1900
01:55:02,410 --> 01:55:03,610
Welcome, sir

1901
01:55:03,650 --> 01:55:04,930
Aw! Cow dung

1902
01:55:04,970 --> 01:55:06,349
You stamped on it?
Let me get you some water

1903
01:55:06,374 --> 01:55:07,294
Don't bother

1904
01:55:07,319 --> 01:55:08,599
Just tell me
where I can get water

1905
01:55:08,757 --> 01:55:09,837
Right here

1906
01:55:11,810 --> 01:55:13,730
'I thought you might
have to give in'

1907
01:55:13,794 --> 01:55:17,554
'I didn't think he would visit us
and accept this alliance'

1908
01:55:18,130 --> 01:55:20,650
'Aunt, it isn't
as simple as you think'

1909
01:55:20,890 --> 01:55:24,130
I was literally lying on
a hot bed of coal for 20 years

1910
01:55:25,130 --> 01:55:28,010
Didn't he make me a widow
and abandon me?

1911
01:55:29,770 --> 01:55:32,770
If I get his daughter married and
make her a widow the very next week?

1912
01:55:33,610 --> 01:55:35,050
Won't he feel the pain?

1913
01:55:37,330 --> 01:55:40,610
I thought she wanted a truce
and I agreed to this alliance

1914
01:55:41,490 --> 01:55:44,090
But she would stoop so low
as to kill her own son...

1915
01:55:44,130 --> 01:55:45,970
...I never even dreamt

1916
01:55:47,010 --> 01:55:49,810
To think I've given my word and
to get my daughter married to Arul...

1917
01:55:51,170 --> 01:55:53,570
...is as good as poisoning
my own daughter

1918
01:55:57,730 --> 01:56:00,090
Even though I thought
caste is the only priority...

1919
01:56:00,130 --> 01:56:05,890
...you were the one who made me
realize people are equally important

1920
01:56:11,690 --> 01:56:17,370
Sir, will you accept my daughter
as your daughter-in-law?

1921
01:56:17,410 --> 01:56:18,770
What is this, sir?

1922
01:56:18,850 --> 01:56:21,530
When you stepped in here, trusting us,
wanting your daughter to be happy...

1923
01:56:21,570 --> 01:56:23,570
...the next minute
she became our daughter-in-law

1924
01:56:23,610 --> 01:56:25,330
Be brave
We are here for you

1925
01:56:43,410 --> 01:56:45,330
Is this way blocked?

1926
01:56:45,410 --> 01:56:46,810
A tree fell across the road, sir

1927
01:56:46,850 --> 01:56:49,170
- I just went by this route
- It fell only now

1928
01:56:49,352 --> 01:56:51,065
They will remove it
only tomorrow morning

1929
01:56:51,090 --> 01:56:51,890
I see

1930
01:56:51,930 --> 01:56:54,490
- Is there another route?
- You can go this way

1931
01:56:54,570 --> 01:56:55,490
- This way?
- Yes

1932
01:56:55,530 --> 01:56:56,610
Okay

1933
01:57:39,432 --> 01:57:40,752
Greetings, anna

1934
01:57:41,843 --> 01:57:42,976
You got your daughter
engaged to my son

1935
01:57:43,001 --> 01:57:44,761
And signed a separate pact there

1936
01:57:45,130 --> 01:57:47,850
Till date you haven't changed one bit

1937
01:57:48,266 --> 01:57:51,186
You continue to be the dunkhead
who cannot honor his words!

1938
01:57:51,211 --> 01:57:53,651
Hey! Mind your words

1939
01:57:54,984 --> 01:57:58,304
Don't I know your intention
when you formalized the engagement?

1940
01:58:00,450 --> 01:58:02,164
My daughter's life
is my only priority

1941
01:58:02,236 --> 01:58:05,276
Then when do we
settle my account?

1942
01:58:05,558 --> 01:58:06,690
Hear me out

1943
01:58:06,770 --> 01:58:08,581
Doesn't matter who
you seek help from

1944
01:58:08,761 --> 01:58:10,481
Not only your daughter

1945
01:58:10,530 --> 01:58:13,450
But you can't even grab
a handful of sand from my house

1946
01:58:15,640 --> 01:58:17,360
It is a major problem

1947
01:58:17,690 --> 01:58:20,850
But come what may
only you should marry the girl

1948
01:58:24,238 --> 01:58:27,558
Just because he came home
I wasn't politely consoling him

1949
01:58:27,583 --> 01:58:30,223
I've given him my word
that you'll do the needful

1950
01:58:32,290 --> 01:58:35,010
Hey Vetri, kidnap her now

1951
01:58:58,690 --> 01:59:00,690
He is missing?
What do you mean?

1952
01:59:00,770 --> 01:59:02,370
Did you enquire thoroughly?

1953
01:59:04,130 --> 01:59:06,370
Let me try his number
and then call you back

1954
01:59:12,890 --> 01:59:15,810
Why is the number switched off?

1955
01:59:18,210 --> 01:59:19,650
Sister-in-law?

1956
01:59:19,760 --> 01:59:21,320
Why do you look dull?

1957
01:59:21,345 --> 01:59:23,465
Your brother promised
to call me last night

1958
01:59:23,490 --> 01:59:24,530
But he didn't

1959
01:59:24,570 --> 01:59:26,930
I tried calling him
The phone is switched off

1960
01:59:26,970 --> 01:59:29,410
Shall I go up to the house and
check if everything is alright?

1961
01:59:29,450 --> 01:59:31,010
Are you going alone?

1962
01:59:31,250 --> 01:59:32,250
Wait

1963
01:59:36,910 --> 01:59:38,770
As a safety measure
let me file a complaint

1964
01:59:38,810 --> 01:59:40,293
...in the police station
that he's missing!

1965
01:59:40,329 --> 01:59:43,129
In case he calls you
call me immediately

1966
01:59:45,079 --> 01:59:46,919
Subha will be fine, right?

1967
01:59:50,210 --> 01:59:51,610
He came only yesterday

1968
01:59:51,853 --> 01:59:53,253
Hey, Kandha

1969
01:59:53,278 --> 01:59:54,438
Come here

1970
01:59:55,610 --> 01:59:57,570
Escort my sister-in-law to her house

1971
01:59:57,610 --> 01:59:58,610
Okay, please come

1972
01:59:58,650 --> 02:00:00,010
See you, sister-in-law

1973
02:00:06,651 --> 02:00:08,171
Call Subha's friend

1974
02:00:08,290 --> 02:00:09,890
Ask her to find out
where she is

1975
02:00:13,547 --> 02:00:16,107
She may know someone
in that village, right?

1976
02:00:16,132 --> 02:00:17,092
That's right

1977
02:00:17,210 --> 02:00:18,490
Hey Latha

1978
02:00:19,265 --> 02:00:22,105
- This is Latha here
- Hey Latha, how are you?

1979
02:00:22,130 --> 02:00:23,163
I called for something else

1980
02:00:23,188 --> 02:00:25,108
Can you do me a favor?

1981
02:00:25,133 --> 02:00:27,253
Why do you even ask?
Tell me what I should do

1982
02:00:27,508 --> 02:00:28,628
Not for me

1983
02:00:30,174 --> 02:00:31,894
My husband will talk to you

1984
02:00:34,564 --> 02:00:36,604
Listen carefully
to what I say

1985
02:00:40,970 --> 02:00:42,730
I'll leave immediately

1986
02:00:46,410 --> 02:00:47,290
What...?

1987
02:00:47,848 --> 02:00:49,290
President hasn't opened his eyes yet

1988
02:00:49,330 --> 02:00:51,028
Should we take him
to the hospital?

1989
02:00:51,053 --> 02:00:52,653
Not in broad daylight!

1990
02:00:52,930 --> 02:00:54,090
Not that-

1991
02:00:54,450 --> 02:00:56,505
Why have you come
instead of your mother?

1992
02:00:56,556 --> 02:00:57,700
Mother isn't feeling too good

1993
02:00:57,725 --> 02:01:00,045
So she sent me to help you
with the wedding preparations

1994
02:01:00,330 --> 02:01:02,050
Go inside and
attend to your work

1995
02:01:02,090 --> 02:01:03,290
Okay, madam

1996
02:01:05,262 --> 02:01:07,942
You leave now, I will make
the necessary arrangements

1997
02:01:07,974 --> 02:01:09,174
Okay, akka

1998
02:01:19,890 --> 02:01:21,690
Subha is here

1999
02:01:21,730 --> 02:01:23,490
But her parents
don't seem to be here

2000
02:01:23,530 --> 02:01:25,150
How are things otherwise?

2001
02:01:25,227 --> 02:01:26,987
Not what you feared at all, anna

2002
02:01:27,090 --> 02:01:28,970
Wedding preparations
are going on normally

2003
02:01:29,010 --> 02:01:30,050
I'll call you again later

2004
02:01:30,090 --> 02:01:32,490
In case you get any information
before that, let me know

2005
02:01:32,530 --> 02:01:33,970
- Okay, anna
- Hey! You

2006
02:01:34,345 --> 02:01:37,225
I told you to dry the rice and you are
busy fiddling with your phone here

2007
02:01:37,250 --> 02:01:40,010
- I already did, madam
- Oh! Okay

2008
02:01:40,730 --> 02:01:43,650
- Do you know to ride a bike?
- Yes, I do

2009
02:01:50,770 --> 02:01:54,450
- Look at this photo
- When did you take this?

2010
02:01:54,810 --> 02:01:56,130
Wait

2011
02:01:56,210 --> 02:01:58,281
- Did akka send it?
- Yes, bro

2012
02:01:58,357 --> 02:01:59,557
Leave it in there

2013
02:01:59,770 --> 02:02:01,210
Okay, bro

2014
02:02:17,090 --> 02:02:20,170
- Anna, I saw the President
- Where did you see him?

2015
02:02:23,570 --> 02:02:25,210
Exactly which spot?

2016
02:02:34,381 --> 02:02:36,890
- Aunt, your phone is ringing
- Bring it here

2017
02:02:39,730 --> 02:02:41,610
Smear this with turmeric
and bring it to me

2018
02:02:41,690 --> 02:02:42,650
Okay

2019
02:02:44,210 --> 02:02:45,730
Tell me

2020
02:02:45,770 --> 02:02:47,713
That girl informed
someone over the phone

2021
02:02:47,738 --> 02:02:48,938
I knew she would

2022
02:02:49,060 --> 02:02:52,580
She has come here only to
spy on us, I was sure

2023
02:02:52,605 --> 02:02:54,965
That's why I sent her there

2024
02:02:55,210 --> 02:02:57,050
She fell into my trap

2025
02:02:57,825 --> 02:03:01,225
A new chap is sure
to land up there

2026
02:03:01,250 --> 02:03:03,450
Take care of him right there

2027
02:03:04,083 --> 02:03:05,163
Understood?

2028
02:03:09,730 --> 02:03:10,850
I'll be back in a bit

2029
02:03:10,930 --> 02:03:13,450
Deliver the vegetables
to the wedding hall

2030
02:03:23,130 --> 02:03:25,450
Only because both families
will patch up their feud...

2031
02:03:25,475 --> 02:03:27,035
...I agreed to this alliance

2032
02:03:27,290 --> 02:03:30,567
But my mother plans to send you back
as a widow 1 week after the wedding

2033
02:03:30,592 --> 02:03:33,247
To take revenge on your father

2034
02:03:33,770 --> 02:03:35,290
How can I go with this?

2035
02:03:36,230 --> 02:03:38,430
I'm absolutely against it

2036
02:03:40,010 --> 02:03:43,208
There's no time to think
Ask Saravanan to come

2037
02:03:43,330 --> 02:03:44,450
Before my mother returns...

2038
02:03:44,475 --> 02:03:46,195
...I'll drop you outside
the village limit

2039
02:03:46,220 --> 02:03:48,020
From there you can
go back with him

2040
02:03:48,130 --> 02:03:50,370
At least I want you
to be happy!

2041
02:03:50,450 --> 02:03:51,930
Talk to him

2042
02:03:55,450 --> 02:03:56,450
Hello...?

2043
02:03:57,542 --> 02:03:58,742
Subha, where are you?

2044
02:04:51,928 --> 02:04:53,128
Let's go in

2045
02:05:00,447 --> 02:05:01,407
Why...?

2046
02:05:01,432 --> 02:05:02,992
No...Saravana-

2047
02:05:08,570 --> 02:05:09,690
It's ringing

2048
02:07:01,610 --> 02:07:03,170
Why isn't he here still?

2049
02:07:11,730 --> 02:07:13,290
Chapter closed!
Let's scoot

2050
02:07:22,090 --> 02:07:23,570
It's Saravanan

2051
02:07:24,810 --> 02:07:26,090
Where are you, Saravana?

2052
02:07:26,130 --> 02:07:27,844
I've come close by
but I don't know the way

2053
02:07:27,869 --> 02:07:28,829
How do I get there?

2054
02:07:28,871 --> 02:07:30,151
He wants to know the way

2055
02:07:30,262 --> 02:07:31,862
The route to get here

2056
02:07:32,090 --> 02:07:34,266
- Saravanan, where are you?
- I'm at the 4 road junction

2057
02:07:34,291 --> 02:07:35,571
Should I take right or left?

2058
02:07:35,596 --> 02:07:37,756
Take right from there
You'll see the temple

2059
02:07:37,900 --> 02:07:38,980
My car is parked outside

2060
02:07:39,005 --> 02:07:39,925
Come in

2061
02:07:39,950 --> 02:07:42,110
Saravanan, please come soon

2062
02:07:42,135 --> 02:07:43,535
I will...I will

2063
02:07:44,220 --> 02:07:45,460
He should be here soon

2064
02:07:45,485 --> 02:07:47,165
He's close by

2065
02:07:51,534 --> 02:07:52,974
Where is the key?

2066
02:07:52,999 --> 02:07:55,239
- Where is the key?
- How will I know?

2067
02:07:55,302 --> 02:07:56,702
You had it with you

2068
02:07:57,410 --> 02:07:59,050
Where did I misplace it?

2069
02:08:11,930 --> 02:08:13,330
I'm here now

2070
02:08:14,302 --> 02:08:15,422
Listen to me

2071
02:08:15,447 --> 02:08:16,527
Don't cry, Subha

2072
02:08:16,552 --> 02:08:18,192
We'll be fine

2073
02:08:22,610 --> 02:08:24,130
I'll call you back

2074
02:08:25,610 --> 02:08:26,890
Leave...leave

2075
02:08:26,930 --> 02:08:28,830
Leave right away
Make sure you don't get caught

2076
02:08:28,855 --> 02:08:29,855
Ask your brother-

2077
02:08:29,880 --> 02:08:31,640
By the way,
where is your brother?

2078
02:08:31,930 --> 02:08:33,930
I was in such a hurry
I forgot to tell him

2079
02:08:33,970 --> 02:08:36,479
You've come to take Subha
How could you not tell him?

2080
02:08:36,504 --> 02:08:37,664
Call him now

2081
02:08:44,530 --> 02:08:46,850
His phone is ringing
But he isn't picking up

2082
02:08:46,930 --> 02:08:49,130
He can pick up
only if he's alive!

2083
02:08:58,930 --> 02:09:00,530
Subha, run

2084
02:09:06,410 --> 02:09:07,890
Saravana...!

2085
02:09:18,850 --> 02:09:21,290
You and your Saravana!

2086
02:09:23,450 --> 02:09:26,050
What do you think of yourself?

2087
02:09:29,170 --> 02:09:31,570
Let go of her

2088
02:09:34,690 --> 02:09:37,210
I won't make allowances
that you are a lady!

2089
02:09:37,290 --> 02:09:38,730
What will you do?

2090
02:09:40,490 --> 02:09:41,770
You come over here

2091
02:09:41,850 --> 02:09:43,450
She is my daughter-in-law

2092
02:09:43,530 --> 02:09:45,370
Who are you
to come in between?

2093
02:09:45,741 --> 02:09:46,981
Trample him

2094
02:09:51,330 --> 02:09:52,650
Don't spare him

2095
02:09:52,690 --> 02:09:53,890
Beat him to death

2096
02:09:53,930 --> 02:09:55,530
Why are you thrashing me?

2097
02:09:58,010 --> 02:09:59,290
Let him go

2098
02:09:59,970 --> 02:10:01,210
Beat him to a pulp

2099
02:10:01,770 --> 02:10:03,410
Let him go

2100
02:10:04,810 --> 02:10:06,770
Where the hell are you rushing?

2101
02:10:08,690 --> 02:10:10,450
Let him go

2102
02:10:11,290 --> 02:10:12,610
Hey! Stop!

2103
02:10:12,970 --> 02:10:14,370
Kill him

2104
02:10:14,930 --> 02:10:16,170
Spare us

2105
02:10:16,210 --> 02:10:17,770
We'll go away

2106
02:10:27,410 --> 02:10:29,250
Don't hurt him
Let him go

2107
02:10:33,290 --> 02:10:35,050
Shove her aside

2108
02:10:39,930 --> 02:10:43,050
Drag her to the spot
where her father is lying

2109
02:10:43,090 --> 02:10:44,850
Okay, akka
Lift her

2110
02:11:27,890 --> 02:11:29,610
'Get up'

2111
02:11:29,810 --> 02:11:31,930
Who asked you to come here?

2112
02:11:33,130 --> 02:11:35,770
Subha is fine

2113
02:11:38,290 --> 02:11:39,570
Go...bash him up

2114
02:11:39,610 --> 02:11:41,050
Finish him off

2115
02:11:43,730 --> 02:11:45,090
Kill him

2116
02:11:45,490 --> 02:11:47,090
Don't touch my brother

2117
02:11:47,170 --> 02:11:49,370
What will you do?

2118
02:11:53,930 --> 02:11:55,370
Don't hit him

2119
02:11:58,210 --> 02:12:00,130
Kill him first

2120
02:12:07,057 --> 02:12:08,497
Finish him once for all

2121
02:12:31,930 --> 02:12:33,850
Leave my son

2122
02:12:33,890 --> 02:12:35,290
Leave him

2123
02:12:37,330 --> 02:12:39,250
Now try to hit my brother

2124
02:12:39,330 --> 02:12:40,810
Go on

2125
02:12:53,130 --> 02:12:54,090
Don't...!

2126
02:12:54,170 --> 02:12:56,210
'Let go of him'

2127
02:12:56,330 --> 02:12:58,290
'Don't hurt him'

2128
02:13:06,890 --> 02:13:09,210
Don't kill him

2129
02:13:24,130 --> 02:13:26,690
How long will it take
for me to finish him off?

2130
02:13:31,660 --> 02:13:34,380
First throw away the enmity
you harbor in your heart

2131
02:13:34,405 --> 02:13:36,965
And learn to forgive people
who made mistakes

2132
02:13:46,130 --> 02:13:47,650
Sir, look here

2133
02:13:48,330 --> 02:13:50,090
Your family members
are standing separately

2134
02:13:50,130 --> 02:13:51,370
Ask them to stand together

2135
02:13:51,410 --> 02:13:52,730
Family members?

2136
02:13:53,370 --> 02:13:55,850
When did they become
part of my family?

2137
02:13:55,930 --> 02:13:57,370
I'll take care of you later

2138
02:13:57,410 --> 02:14:00,010
It's either them or me today
Won't spare you, bloody rascals!

2139
02:14:00,090 --> 02:14:02,770
To spoil a couple from bonding
4 of you have joined together?

2140
02:14:02,810 --> 02:14:04,450
Nab that bloody driver

2141
02:14:04,490 --> 02:14:06,490
At least catch the astrologe-

2142
02:14:06,570 --> 02:14:07,930
What happened?

2143
02:14:07,970 --> 02:14:09,490
You want to know why?

2144
02:14:09,530 --> 02:14:13,690
These 4 scoundrels always ogle
at my beautiful wife, Vaadamalli

2145
02:14:13,730 --> 02:14:15,610
Until now you haven't
questioned them at all

2146
02:14:15,650 --> 02:14:18,105
Not 4 even if 4000 people
ogle at your wife...

2147
02:14:18,130 --> 02:14:20,410
...you have to trust your wife!

2148
02:14:20,686 --> 02:14:22,855
I trust your wife, don't you?

2149
02:14:23,253 --> 02:14:25,493
'He used me to
preach his message'

2150
02:14:25,690 --> 02:14:27,130
Please sit upright

2151
02:14:27,890 --> 02:14:31,170
- Are you ready?
- Wait a minute

2152
02:14:32,210 --> 02:14:34,170
All of you are in pairs

2153
02:14:34,250 --> 02:14:35,650
Where is my wife?

2154
02:14:35,853 --> 02:14:37,253
You should've called her, right?

2155
02:14:37,278 --> 02:14:38,278
Let him call

2156
02:14:38,303 --> 02:14:39,423
Latha...?

2157
02:14:40,702 --> 02:14:41,942
Come

2158
02:14:44,018 --> 02:14:45,098
Come here

2159
02:14:45,178 --> 02:14:50,138
"No one as awesome as you
I've ever met, my beau"

2160
02:14:50,210 --> 02:14:51,810
Now click my family photo

2161
02:14:51,850 --> 02:14:56,050
"Nothing compares to you
My husband whom I love so true"

2162
02:14:56,130 --> 02:14:59,090
subtitled by rekhs
assisted by harini

2163
02:15:01,450 --> 02:15:06,010
"You entered my life like divinity
Even before I asked, you blessed me"

2164
02:15:06,050 --> 02:15:09,930
"Golden hearted soul that you are
I worship you, no holds barred"

2165
02:15:09,970 --> 02:15:14,610
"How many ever births, you and me
together we will always be"

2166
02:15:14,690 --> 02:15:18,730
"No one as humane as you
I've ever met, whole life through"

2167
02:15:18,770 --> 02:15:23,490
"Looking at you, tall and gentlemanly
even the vast sky may diminish gently"

2168
02:15:23,570 --> 02:15:27,850
"No one as handsome as you
I've ever met my whole life through"

2169
02:15:27,930 --> 02:15:32,450
"Looking at your height, I confess
even the endless sky may compress"
