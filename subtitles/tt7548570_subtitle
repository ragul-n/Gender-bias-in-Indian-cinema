2
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,774
Shucks.
We are late, Jacob.

3
00:06:31,257 --> 00:06:33,885
Sir, they're asking what's the case.
I don't think they will let her out.

4
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:36,716
So the oldies would let her out only
if we explain the sections?

5
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,949
So Sister, there's
nothing more to say.

6
00:06:50,476 --> 00:06:51,898
Bring the girl you're
hiding in there.

7
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:53,463
Whatever I have to
ask, I'll ask her.

8
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:55,885
And, it's a Sub Inspector
who is on his death bed.

9
00:06:56,282 --> 00:06:58,762
She and her boyfriend did
it earlier this night.

10
00:06:59,685 --> 00:07:02,199
Sir, for God's sake, please
understand the truth.

11
00:07:02,989 --> 00:07:04,502
It was when he tried
to hurt Betty,

12
00:07:05,024 --> 00:07:06,503
that Jacob interfered,
and all that happened.

13
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:09,059
My dear aunty,

14
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:11,699
I don't need your approval.

15
00:07:14,634 --> 00:07:16,704
do you know what all he is
doing in Kotlayam town,

16
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:18,206
after trying to kill the SI?

17
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:20,291
Now he's missing.

18
00:07:24,143 --> 00:07:25,428
We need to get him at any cost.

19
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:27,343
For that, we're taking
her along with us.

20
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:30,162
So should we get in or...

21
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:36,558
Call that Betty here..

22
00:07:50,236 --> 00:07:51,339
Hey.. Did he call you?

23
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:52,890
No.

24
00:07:53,272 --> 00:07:54,170
Where is he now?

25
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:55,960
I don't know.

26
00:07:57,376 --> 00:07:58,195
Take her in.

27
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:00,062
Mother,

28
00:08:00,947 --> 00:08:02,312
- Mother, ask them to leave me.
- Come here.

29
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:03,401
Leave me.

30
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:05,048
Mother, ask them to leave me.
- Walk!

31
00:08:05,451 --> 00:08:06,782
Ask them not to take me.

32
00:08:07,453 --> 00:08:08,522
Stop crying & get in.
- Leave me.

33
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:10,695
Troubling us during the night.
- I'm not coming.

34
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:12,236
Mother, please tell them.

35
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:14,448
Mother, tell them not to take me.

36
00:08:16,562 --> 00:08:17,381
Start the car!

37
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:37,776
Did they find only this
road to fight & die?

38
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:39,879
Nuisances!
- Looks like they're drunk, sir.

39
00:08:45,558 --> 00:08:46,604
Sir, they're not on alcohol.

40
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:47,878
Must be Marijuana.

41
00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:49,903
This ain't any of that.
Must be a higher grade item.

42
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:51,571
Hey! Move!

43
00:08:53,766 --> 00:08:55,779
Who are these guys?
- I haven't seen them earlier, sir.

44
00:08:56,135 --> 00:08:58,148
Stop staring & take them away.
- They might have weapons.

45
00:08:58,504 --> 00:09:00,278
Hey! Move your vehicle
from the road.

46
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,824
Move your bike, I say.

47
00:09:03,242 --> 00:09:04,982
Looks like they'll kill each other.
- Push them away.

48
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:06,471
Can't you hear us?
Move!

49
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:22,125
Jacob!
- Betty, get out!

50
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:27,073
Leave me.

51
00:09:29,201 --> 00:09:30,395
Come.
Let's go.

52
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:32,423
Come.

53
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:19,663
'As funeral pyres
burn on empty roads'

54
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:22,770
'Faltered steps will
write our destiny'

55
00:10:23,356 --> 00:10:25,904
'The burning sun will depart'

56
00:10:26,325 --> 00:10:29,067
'Darkness will spread
even during the day'

57
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:32,076
'As funeral pyres
burn on empty roads'

58
00:10:32,531 --> 00:10:35,182
'Faltered steps will
write our destiny'

59
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:38,240
'The burning sun will depart'

60
00:10:38,671 --> 00:10:41,276
'Darkness will spread
even during the day'

61
00:10:41,707 --> 00:10:46,497
'In this never ending night'

62
00:10:47,346 --> 00:10:52,670
'We're on a journey,
searching for new shores'

63
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:58,843
'While we search for dreams
with wings, far away'

64
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:04,926
'As shadows hide the
paths with pain'

65
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:10,947
'Did a red ember shine?'

66
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:16,734
'Did the heart burn?'

67
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,171
'Will this story continue?'

68
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,935
'As funeral pyres
burn on empty roads'

69
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:25,248
'Faltered steps will

00:11:25,751 --> 00:11:28,117
'The burning sun will depart'

00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:31,672
'Darkness will spread
even during the day'

72
00:11:56,348 --> 00:12:06,804
'Will you come searching for the footsteps
of time, even if they are far away?'

73
00:12:08,994 --> 00:12:14,057
'Is a golden bird singing?'

74
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:20,445
'Did you see a tree of flowers
that gives shade on the shore?'

75
00:12:21,273 --> 00:12:26,097
'The eyes stand guard
as shining lamps'

76
00:12:27,513 --> 00:12:31,791
'The breeze disappears
somewhere, in pain'

77
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:33,998
'Will this story continue?'

78
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:57,982
Tell me, dude.
- What's happening, Jacob?

79
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:01,502
Dude, what's the status?

80
00:13:03,749 --> 00:13:05,967
Why should you be scared?
Murugan is my guy.

81
00:13:06,685 --> 00:13:08,846
Then, I have paid him
the money he wants.

82
00:13:09,321 --> 00:13:10,276
Go to him tomorrow itself.

83
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:13,965
Dude, we'll get the passports
tomorrow itself, right?

84
00:13:15,394 --> 00:13:17,259
Just that it would take 2
days to get the Visa stamped.

85
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:20,258
Okay dude.
- Don't worry.

86
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:25,868
We'll get the passports tomorrow.

87
00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:37,023
Here.

88
00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:41,380
Both are okay.
Don't worry.

89
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:43,300
Cigarette?
- No.

90
00:13:44,523 --> 00:13:46,707
Bro, there won't be any problem
at the airport, right?

91
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:49,777
For that, there ain't any look out
notice in your names, right? - Not yet.

92
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:51,994
Then there's no problem.
You be ready.

93
00:13:52,464 --> 00:13:54,102
I'll call you as soon
as the Visa is stamped.

94
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,174
Mangalore to Sri Lanka;
Sri Lanka to Australia.

95
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:58,049
Have a blast with
Charlie in Australia.

96
00:13:58,370 --> 00:13:59,598
One tea. You want tea?
- No thanks.

97
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:05,204
See you bro.
- Okay Jacob.

98
00:14:22,494 --> 00:14:24,132
My dear Lord,

99
00:14:25,297 --> 00:14:28,539
I'll go to Kottayam and
tell a thousand people,

100
00:14:29,101 --> 00:14:31,149
that you rose like a
rocket on the third day.

101
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:33,954
Sir, shall we catch
him right away?

102
00:14:34,406 --> 00:14:36,215
I'm also really tempted to do that.

103
00:14:38,744 --> 00:14:40,348
Only then we will go
back to Kottayam.

104
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:41,532
Start the car.

105
00:14:52,024 --> 00:14:53,833
Betty, they have reached
here from Kottayam.

106
00:14:58,197 --> 00:14:59,300
You don't be tensed.

107
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:01,919
I'm telling you, right?

108
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:06,392
You go to the Convent.

109
00:15:13,345 --> 00:15:14,164
I'm also moving.

110
00:15:14,546 --> 00:15:16,355
We have to survive for a
few days more, somehow.

111
00:15:27,192 --> 00:15:28,204
Charlie, can you hear me?
- Yes.

112
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:31,361
I had called Murugan. The Passports
& Visa are ready. Go & get it.

113
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:35,252
What is it?

114
00:15:35,634 --> 00:15:37,329
The policemen from Kottayam
have reached here.

115
00:15:45,344 --> 00:15:47,483
Jacob, whatever happens,
don't get caught by them.

116
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,149
If they catch you,
you're done for!

117
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:51,428
Do one thing. Send Betty to
collect the passports & Visa.

118
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:54,074
You don't step out.
That's safer.

119
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,539
Okay dude.

120
00:15:56,255 --> 00:15:58,803
I'll collect the passports from
Murugan Chettan tomorrow itself.

121
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:02,235
I'll call you after that.
- Okay.

122
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:22,010
(speaking in Kannada)

123
00:17:57,643 --> 00:17:58,462
Hey!

124
00:18:00,512 --> 00:18:01,331
Go!

125
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:37,676
(indistinct arguments in Kannada)

126
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:04,773
Stop!

127
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:10,758
She has lost a lot of blood.

128
00:20:11,176 --> 00:20:13,417
What happened to her?

129
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:17,988
There's no sofa set in
our hospital's van!

130
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:20,903
Sign this.

131
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,234
Get up.

132
00:20:29,695 --> 00:20:31,333
Where is this?
- Syringe!

133
00:20:33,131 --> 00:20:34,905
It's a syringe.
- I don't want any injection.

134
00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:37,757
(continues speaking in Kannada)
- Where is Jacob?

135
00:20:40,305 --> 00:20:41,124
Leave me.

136
00:20:41,373 --> 00:20:43,386
I'm not crazy. Leave me.
Where is Jacob?

137
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:46,108
I don't understand what you're saying.
Leave me.

138
00:20:48,213 --> 00:20:49,032
Where is Jacob?

139
00:20:50,315 --> 00:20:51,236
I have to go!

140
00:20:51,516 --> 00:20:52,335
I have to go!

141
00:20:52,684 --> 00:20:53,639
Where is Jacob?

142
00:21:49,608 --> 00:21:52,941
Do you remember how you came from
Kottayam 2 months back, you scoundrel?

143
00:21:55,781 --> 00:21:58,204
Throw that son of a
b@$@h into the Jeep.

144
00:21:59,217 --> 00:22:00,002
Come here, you..

145
00:22:08,193 --> 00:22:10,332
Jacob Varghese, age 30.

146
00:22:11,129 --> 00:22:12,903
An accused in 5 cases,
including murder.

147
00:22:17,636 --> 00:22:22,107
This person & the 2nd accused Betty killed
SI James Mathew of East Police Station.

148
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:28,214
they stole 3.5 crores from the finance
company they were working for.

149
00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:33,813
they critically injured
lady constables & others,

150
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:35,780
and all three of them got away.

151
00:22:39,591 --> 00:22:40,899
The first accused, Jacob Varghese

152
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:43,298
was arrested by the
investigation team at Mysore.

153
00:22:49,568 --> 00:22:50,933
What a lame tea!

154
00:22:53,238 --> 00:22:54,159
Do you want tea, Appachan?

155
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:09,266
Don't be sad thinking
that you're alone.

156
00:23:09,654 --> 00:23:11,292
We'll nab him & her from Mysore.

157
00:23:11,757 --> 00:23:12,576
Then,

158
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:15,400
we're going to accept
Appachan's contract.

159
00:24:07,546 --> 00:24:09,150
'Sub Jail
Kottayam'

160
00:24:24,062 --> 00:24:25,484
Hey! Will anyone
come to see you?

161
00:24:25,764 --> 00:24:26,583
No sir.

162
00:24:26,998 --> 00:24:28,044
Do you have money with you?
- Yes.

163
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,119
Then come.

164
00:24:32,204 --> 00:24:33,535
Hey! Give him the regulars.

165
00:24:34,005 --> 00:24:35,233
So you were nabbed
finally, Jacob!

166
00:24:35,607 --> 00:24:36,596
How much?
- 90.

167
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:38,236
It's so expensive.
- Give me the match box.

168
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:39,431
Buy it if you want it.

169
00:24:41,613 --> 00:24:43,353
That's how badly you & Charlie
messed with Appachan.

170
00:24:46,351 --> 00:24:47,830
You don't have anything right?
- No.

171
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:01,151
840 Rupees.

172
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:10,110
I'll give you the balance
when you leave from here.

173
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:12,647
Come.

174
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:56,206
Sir..

175
00:25:58,490 --> 00:25:59,309
Take it away!

176
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:22,997
No sir.
I'll do it now.

177
00:26:26,017 --> 00:26:27,416
Anil, take him back to the cell.

178
00:26:31,656 --> 00:26:32,497
Come..

179
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:48,152
Weren't you supposed
to come before lunch?

180
00:26:56,147 --> 00:26:56,966
Take it off.

181
00:26:58,483 --> 00:27:00,439
Remove it.
Is there any dope with you?

182
00:27:00,986 --> 00:27:03,261
Are you going to Sabarimala,
growing your hair & beard?

183
00:27:10,562 --> 00:27:11,381
Raise your hands.

184
00:27:14,532 --> 00:27:16,102
Oh! A ring?
- Sir, no..

185
00:27:16,434 --> 00:27:17,253
Remove it.

186
00:27:22,173 --> 00:27:22,992
Walk!

187
00:27:23,575 --> 00:27:25,759
Remove everything and check.
- Get in.

188
00:27:26,211 --> 00:27:28,167
These guys might hide stuff
even in their intestines.

189
00:27:36,254 --> 00:27:37,300
Why are you shy?

190
00:27:38,223 --> 00:27:39,042
Move your legs.

191
00:27:40,592 --> 00:27:41,820
Don't dance.
Stand properly.

192
00:27:43,361 --> 00:27:45,283
There's nothing.
Are you a saint or what?

193
00:27:46,064 --> 00:27:46,883
Wear your pants.

194
00:27:51,102 --> 00:27:51,921
Wear it properly.

195
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:58,507
When you left Kottayam, there
was a nun with you, right?

196
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:02,758
You b@$%!@$&, look at my face!

197
00:28:05,116 --> 00:28:07,664
When I ask a question, I
need an immediate answer.

198
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:10,133
If you take time to answer,

199
00:28:10,655 --> 00:28:12,987
your dad and mom are not
here to listen to that!

200
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:14,856
She is pregnant, sir.

201
00:28:15,126 --> 00:28:17,845
In that policeman's murder case,

202
00:28:18,396 --> 00:28:20,785
they will give you five years.

203
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,738
Then Appachan,

204
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:27,160
He's just going to
start his game.

205
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:30,204
We won't give you bail.

206
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:33,283
We won't allow that.

207
00:28:34,012 --> 00:28:35,786
Bloody son of a b@%%!@

208
00:28:37,182 --> 00:28:38,001
Then,

209
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:41,754
settle down here for 2 years,
having some nice fish curry meals.

210
00:28:42,353 --> 00:28:44,423
The rest you can
spend at Viyoor.

211
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:49,911
Bloody..

212
00:28:54,666 --> 00:28:55,997
Hid everything, man!

213
00:28:56,267 --> 00:28:57,279
They will come now.

214
00:28:59,437 --> 00:29:01,166
Get up and arrange everything.

215
00:29:27,565 --> 00:29:29,669
Who is the new one here today?
- It's him, sir.

216
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:33,058
You?
- Yes sir.

217
00:29:34,405 --> 00:29:36,134
Sir, it wasn't me..
It..

218
00:29:36,508 --> 00:29:38,726
Open your mouth & say it.
- Tell him what your case is.

219
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:41,339
It's a theft case, sir.
- What?

220
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:42,602
Theft case!

221
00:29:43,047 --> 00:29:44,002
What did you steal?

222
00:29:44,249 --> 00:29:46,080
I didn't steal anything, sir.
It's a false case.

223
00:29:46,417 --> 00:29:47,236
False case?

224
00:29:47,485 --> 00:29:50,033
If so, all the people who are
here must be saints, right?

225
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,279
What is it?

226
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:02,179
No way! Go to the office and
apply medicine. That's all.

227
00:30:02,534 --> 00:30:05,253
Sir, here's a chocolate wrapper.
I got it from this toilet.

228
00:30:06,404 --> 00:30:07,416
They ate it today, sir.

229
00:30:10,441 --> 00:30:11,260
Who ate this?

230
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:13,046
They are all silent now.

231
00:30:13,344 --> 00:30:15,005
Did it come out on its
own from the toilet?

232
00:30:15,613 --> 00:30:17,069
You're the mason here, right?
- Yes sir.

233
00:30:17,382 --> 00:30:19,805
Who ate this? If you don't say
the truth, I'll be hitting you instead.

234
00:30:21,252 --> 00:30:23,300
Sir, his wife & kids had come.
They must have given it.

235
00:30:24,022 --> 00:30:27,002
Bastard! Do you think this
is your aunty's house?

236
00:30:27,525 --> 00:30:28,366
Don't kick me, sir.

237
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:32,608
If she had poisoned it and given
you, you would die in here.

238
00:30:33,231 --> 00:30:34,220
We'll be screwed.

239
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:36,760
What you're supposed to eat,
is being cooked here.

240
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:39,589
Understood?

241
00:30:40,538 --> 00:30:42,017
I won't repeat it, sir.

242
00:30:42,707 --> 00:30:43,526
Come.

243
00:30:43,741 --> 00:30:46,665
Ask everyone to sit down there.
- All of you sit down. Fast!

244
00:30:50,148 --> 00:30:51,103
Give me that book.

245
00:30:51,649 --> 00:30:53,219
3...6...

246
00:30:55,286 --> 00:30:56,105
Full name?

247
00:31:04,462 --> 00:31:05,303
Varghese Thottathil

248
00:31:11,436 --> 00:31:12,255
Father's profession?

249
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:20,499
In which school?

250
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:22,191
At CMS College.

251
00:31:25,316 --> 00:31:26,135
Mother?

252
00:31:30,755 --> 00:31:32,393
And look at what you've become!

253
00:31:35,193 --> 00:31:36,012
Where are they now?

254
00:31:38,596 --> 00:31:39,904
Both of them?
- Yes.

255
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:42,559
Tell me your
identification marks.

256
00:32:08,226 --> 00:32:10,057
(Counting from 1 to 8)

257
00:32:11,562 --> 00:32:14,019
Who's the new one here today?
- There's no one new here today, sir.

258
00:32:16,701 --> 00:32:18,066
Hey! Leave sir..

259
00:32:18,369 --> 00:32:20,064
Sir, come fast.
These guys are..

260
00:32:21,506 --> 00:32:23,485
He's getting away.
Catch him!

261
00:32:25,076 --> 00:32:26,498
Come! Run!
- Stop!

262
00:32:27,011 --> 00:32:28,171
They're escaping.
Come fast!

263
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:29,265
Sir!

264
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:31,146
Stop there!

265
00:32:31,482 --> 00:32:32,380
Stop there.

266
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:33,629
Hey Udayan!

267
00:32:34,152 --> 00:32:35,289
You cannot escape!

268
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,076
Bloody son of a b!#@&!

269
00:32:37,722 --> 00:32:38,541
Hey!

270
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:43,613
Come fast.

271
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,019
Come!

272
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:52,343
Open it!

273
00:34:56,294 --> 00:34:58,342
(voices approaching)

274
00:35:05,336 --> 00:35:06,325
Hit him!

275
00:35:17,381 --> 00:35:18,837
You rascal!

276
00:35:23,221 --> 00:35:25,849
Tie up his hands & legs!

277
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:27,154
Come here, you..

278
00:35:28,693 --> 00:35:29,830
Leave me!

279
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:35,276
I'll finish you!

280
00:35:39,704 --> 00:35:40,523
Get inside.

281
00:35:53,784 --> 00:35:56,412
I was waiting for someone here.

282
00:35:57,788 --> 00:36:01,155
Those hundred people who clapped
for your earlier debauchery;

283
00:36:01,726 --> 00:36:03,125
I want them to see him.

284
00:36:54,011 --> 00:36:55,820
Sub Jail
Kottayam

285
00:37:07,458 --> 00:37:08,277
Hey Lukochan!

286
00:37:11,596 --> 00:37:13,757
They brought him out.
Where are they taking him?

287
00:37:14,465 --> 00:37:17,093
Who will get to bash him up tonight?
- Keep quiet, man.

288
00:37:21,272 --> 00:37:22,341
Looks like he's coming here.

289
00:37:24,008 --> 00:37:25,054
Lukochan!

290
00:37:25,476 --> 00:37:26,295
Awesome!

291
00:37:31,115 --> 00:37:32,514
Give him also a share
of your dinner.

292
00:37:32,984 --> 00:37:35,259
The curry won't be enough, sir.
It's not even enough for me.

293
00:37:35,653 --> 00:37:36,608
He'll eat without curry.

294
00:37:37,054 --> 00:37:38,749
Plain rice?
Then let him have that.

295
00:38:22,433 --> 00:38:23,980
You! You..

296
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:25,815
I'll kill you!
- Leave the bar.

297
00:38:26,237 --> 00:38:27,750
Now I'm not going
to leave from here.

298
00:38:28,072 --> 00:38:29,937
Even if they leave me, I won't go.

299
00:38:30,608 --> 00:38:31,836
You're finished!

300
00:38:35,413 --> 00:38:37,779
You'll fall dead here, you swine!
- Leave it.

301
00:38:39,417 --> 00:38:40,429
You're finished!

302
00:38:40,685 --> 00:38:41,993
You're finished!

303
00:38:42,286 --> 00:38:43,537
Drag him to the left.

304
00:38:53,097 --> 00:38:53,916
Lie there, you..

305
00:38:58,169 --> 00:38:58,988
You..

306
00:38:59,203 --> 00:39:01,068
I shouldn't see you even
at the verandah hereafter.

307
00:39:01,439 --> 00:39:03,270
Even if it's to
collect your food.

308
00:39:06,077 --> 00:39:07,908
if any of you talk to him;

309
00:39:10,081 --> 00:39:10,900
Remember that.

310
00:39:30,234 --> 00:39:31,053
Beedi?

311
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:34,106
Dude, give me a couple of beedis.

312
00:39:34,739 --> 00:39:36,252
Give me at least one, man!

313
00:39:40,745 --> 00:39:43,168
Simon bro.
He's the mason. Give it to him.

314
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:19,238
Give me also one, dude.

315
00:40:19,483 --> 00:40:20,882
Give me three. Let
me stock it up.

316
00:40:21,152 --> 00:40:22,574
We don't want your alms!

317
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,280
Shove this down your throat.

318
00:40:24,555 --> 00:40:26,364
Take it & get lost.
Your damn beedi!

319
00:40:41,505 --> 00:40:43,427
Your arrival was damn impressive

320
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:47,415
Don't sleep.
That's better for you.

321
00:40:48,245 --> 00:40:51,134
Or else, the people in here
will hit a nail on your head

322
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:53,943
Understood?
- Hey! Stop it!

323
00:40:55,186 --> 00:40:58,246
Hey Ottayan, to get so worked up,
Udayan is not your dad, right?

324
00:40:59,523 --> 00:41:00,831
And if he had escaped,

325
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:03,400
you think you could come & stand
here at this time as a kitchen worker?

326
00:41:04,361 --> 00:41:05,180
And the nail..

327
00:41:08,098 --> 00:41:09,793
Don't yap too much
standing here.

328
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:11,180
Take this and get going.

329
00:41:11,402 --> 00:41:12,357
Go! Go to your cell.

330
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:13,989
Get lost.

331
00:41:14,205 --> 00:41:15,365
Sir, play the music!
Music!

332
00:41:16,006 --> 00:41:17,257
- Or else, I'll start shouting..
- Sir..

333
00:41:17,508 --> 00:41:20,056
Play that song.. Or else, these guys
will curse your dad. - Get lost!

334
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:27,420
Eat it, man.

335
00:41:29,787 --> 00:41:30,606
I said don't take it.

336
00:41:32,122 --> 00:41:33,259
Can I take that piece?
- Damn..

337
00:41:35,092 --> 00:41:37,231
This food is made specially
for the officers.

338
00:41:38,395 --> 00:41:39,874
Simon will give marijuana
for one beedi.

339
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:42,321
In return, we get this meat.

340
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:50,219
If you don't want it,
throw it in the toilet.

341
00:41:51,242 --> 00:41:52,470
It's your first time, right?
That's why.

342
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:06,997
How dare you throw
the rice away?

343
00:42:07,291 --> 00:42:08,929
Will your mom come and clean it?

344
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:11,239
You pig!
- Pin him to the wall!

345
00:42:11,629 --> 00:42:12,880
Hey! Hey!

346
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:14,768
Stop it!
Stop it, I say!

347
00:42:15,065 --> 00:42:16,805
He trapped Udayan
right when he came.

348
00:42:17,167 --> 00:42:18,395
Stop it!
Stop it, I say!

349
00:42:19,503 --> 00:42:21,050
Is this your first time?
- Yes.

350
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:23,203
Didn't he say?
It's his first time. Go!

351
00:42:23,674 --> 00:42:25,835
Don't get into tussles..
Just tell him what the matter is.

352
00:42:30,681 --> 00:42:32,490
what is it, bro?
- Tell him how things are over here.

353
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:41,089
Or else, those wardens
will beat us up.

354
00:42:41,492 --> 00:42:42,914
And they are major foodies.

355
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:45,030
Whatever waste you have,
dump it in the toilet.

356
00:42:45,362 --> 00:42:47,136
Me & Lukochan will go
out on bail very soon.

357
00:42:47,464 --> 00:42:49,102
You guys are going to
be here for a long time.

358
00:42:59,476 --> 00:43:00,226
He's half-crazy.

359
00:43:00,978 --> 00:43:04,163
For stealing some metal from the railway
lines, CRPF charged a case on him.

360
00:43:06,383 --> 00:43:07,862
There's no one to get
him out on bail.

361
00:43:10,521 --> 00:43:12,352
You killed an SI, right?

362
00:43:13,557 --> 00:43:15,331
What was the matter?
- You scoundrels!

363
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:17,311
I've told you not to disturb while I'm
praying.

364
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:18,493
I'll rip your head apart.

365
00:43:27,371 --> 00:43:29,441
It's getting over, brother.
Give me one more.

366
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:31,005
Isn't it time to sleep yet?

367
00:43:33,677 --> 00:43:34,871
Go and ring the bell, sir.

368
00:43:35,179 --> 00:43:35,998
Then come and check.

369
00:43:36,213 --> 00:43:37,521
You will sleep only
if it turns 9?

370
00:43:38,015 --> 00:43:40,028
'Sir, go sir..
Go to your house, sir'

371
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:43,761
don't think you can live
happily claiming to be crazy.

372
00:43:45,222 --> 00:43:46,553
If it gets too much,
straight to the asylum!

373
00:43:47,024 --> 00:43:48,218
You & your damn song!

374
00:43:48,726 --> 00:43:49,545
Yesudas is good.

375
00:43:50,594 --> 00:43:51,413
But not good enough.

376
00:43:58,302 --> 00:44:01,544
Damn you.. - How many has he
been smoking since morning!

377
00:44:04,708 --> 00:44:05,845
Hard luck, Jacob.

378
00:44:06,276 --> 00:44:07,379
The light will be on all night.

379
00:44:44,381 --> 00:44:45,951
Hey! Why aren't you sleeping?

380
00:44:52,756 --> 00:44:54,485
Didn't you hear the sound
of a train passing by?

381
00:44:55,325 --> 00:44:56,428
That's the Island
Express of 2 AM.

382
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:58,392
The station is just
1 km away from here.

383
00:45:25,255 --> 00:45:26,506
Bring it fast.
Why the delay?

384
00:45:29,126 --> 00:45:30,377
Hey! Stand in line.

385
00:45:30,661 --> 00:45:33,027
Haven't we told you to leave the
towels inside while coming out?

386
00:45:33,464 --> 00:45:34,510
Are you new here or what?

387
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:37,712
So that you won't escape even if you get
a chance, because you're not clothed.

388
00:45:38,202 --> 00:45:39,863
Where is Simon?
- He is bathing, sir.

389
00:45:40,471 --> 00:45:41,517
Hey!

390
00:45:42,139 --> 00:45:43,948
Come out fast.
The police are here to take you.

391
00:45:44,308 --> 00:45:45,445
Come out fast, man.

392
00:45:46,009 --> 00:45:47,112
I'm coming.

393
00:45:47,611 --> 00:45:50,125
You can drink that later. Police
is waiting to take you to court.

394
00:45:50,647 --> 00:45:51,932
Then do one thing.
Give me the money.

395
00:45:52,216 --> 00:45:53,467
I'll eat on the way.
Then what?

396
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:56,390
I'll come only after
having tea and Chappathi.

397
00:45:56,687 --> 00:45:58,018
I'll tie you up and take you!

398
00:45:58,322 --> 00:46:00,278
Tie me up!
I'm going to the court.

399
00:46:00,657 --> 00:46:02,170
I'll tell the judge
what's happening here.

400
00:46:02,526 --> 00:46:04,039
You wanna see that?
Wanna see?

401
00:46:04,328 --> 00:46:05,875
Wanna see that?
- You b@$%@$!

402
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:08,858
I'll beat the living daylights out of you..
- Send me out after hitting me!

403
00:46:09,366 --> 00:46:10,970
Leave me.
- What did you think?

404
00:46:11,268 --> 00:46:12,997
You'll come back here only, right?

405
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:14,802
Son of a b!@##!

406
00:46:15,105 --> 00:46:17,244
Don't forget all the laws
even when you're back!

407
00:46:19,076 --> 00:46:20,441
Stop staring and serve tea.

408
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:23,432
Leave my hand.

409
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:08,803
Both of you have been bullshitting
for quite some time now.

410
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:11,821
If you can't, tell me.
I'll find someone else.

411
00:47:16,466 --> 00:47:17,330
No. I'm not lighting it.

412
00:47:19,069 --> 00:47:20,297
What's that Prabhu's stand?

413
00:47:20,737 --> 00:47:21,988
Prabhu is not a problem, sir.

414
00:47:22,272 --> 00:47:23,751
He will be with us
in any way we want.

415
00:47:26,443 --> 00:47:28,308
That's not enough..

416
00:47:29,012 --> 00:47:31,173
That's not enough to make him
open his mouth. - What sir?

417
00:47:31,648 --> 00:47:33,252
That's not enough to
make him open his mouth.

418
00:47:35,452 --> 00:47:36,271
David,

419
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:38,461
we can't proceed until
we find his wife.

420
00:47:39,656 --> 00:47:41,112
What about her?
Say that first.

421
00:47:44,027 --> 00:47:46,678
Every nook & corner of Mysore is
being searched, sir. - Ya right.

422
00:47:47,297 --> 00:47:49,345
A call might come any moment,
saying that she has been found.

423
00:47:51,568 --> 00:47:53,297
If she's found, good for you.

424
00:48:00,677 --> 00:48:02,690
Mooppan, give him a job.

425
00:48:04,114 --> 00:48:06,002
There are some coconuts lying outside.
Peel them & bring.

426
00:48:06,416 --> 00:48:07,428
Jose, show him how to do it.

427
00:48:07,684 --> 00:48:08,503
Come here.

428
00:48:09,486 --> 00:48:10,305
Come.

429
00:48:11,121 --> 00:48:14,989
Appachan sir, SI sir and all of us are
going to get you into a coffin soon.

430
00:48:17,027 --> 00:48:17,846
Be ready.

431
00:48:19,196 --> 00:48:21,061
Stop ogling and wash the rice.

432
00:48:22,299 --> 00:48:23,755
I understood what Appachan said.

433
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:27,673
I know that you'll have stuff
while coming from the court.

434
00:48:28,038 --> 00:48:28,936
Where's the dope?

435
00:48:29,373 --> 00:48:30,510
You're searching for it, right?

436
00:48:31,141 --> 00:48:33,029
Find it if you can.
- You didn't like it?

437
00:48:34,711 --> 00:48:36,190
I'll send you in
just like that then.

438
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,241
Sir, I have marijuana with me.
If you can, take it.

439
00:48:39,716 --> 00:48:41,377
No need to talk so much.
- I'll get it from you.

440
00:48:43,153 --> 00:48:44,290
Either today or tomorrow,

441
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:46,420
I'll find it from your lips.

442
00:48:47,291 --> 00:48:48,189
That day will be your end.

443
00:48:48,392 --> 00:48:49,939
Sir, there's something
on his thighs.

444
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:53,627
Take it out.

445
00:48:56,266 --> 00:48:57,255
Sir, porn magazine!

446
00:48:57,534 --> 00:48:58,865
What is this, man?

447
00:48:59,536 --> 00:49:00,355
Where did you get it from?

448
00:49:00,637 --> 00:49:02,207
Say it.
- My friend gave it, sir.

449
00:49:05,375 --> 00:49:06,194
Keep it.

450
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:09,472
Or else, they'll rip you apart.

451
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:11,869
Wear it and come.

452
00:49:12,649 --> 00:49:13,468
Brother, my..

453
00:49:18,956 --> 00:49:20,730
You need only half; or else,
you'll be really tired.

454
00:49:21,091 --> 00:49:22,137
Don't lose any papers.
- Get lost!

455
00:49:22,392 --> 00:49:23,381
Come.
- Coming, sir.

456
00:49:45,749 --> 00:49:47,933
Bro, that's a good chick.
Who has she come for?

457
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:49,816
She's great, man.
- Nice item.

458
00:49:51,555 --> 00:49:53,386
It's been some 16 months
since I saw a woman.

459
00:49:54,124 --> 00:49:55,853
You rascals, that's my wife and kid.
I'll kick you..

460
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:57,854
My dear bro, I just
looked, I didn't see her.

461
00:49:58,161 --> 00:49:59,298
I'll break your bones!

462
00:50:02,366 --> 00:50:03,526
Sir, that's my wife.

463
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:04,638
Sir!

464
00:50:05,402 --> 00:50:06,221
Open, sir.

465
00:50:12,175 --> 00:50:13,984
Haven't I told you not to
come here with the kid?

466
00:50:17,381 --> 00:50:19,246
Me and mother are leaving from Kochi.
- Where to?

467
00:50:22,285 --> 00:50:23,149
Then what about our house?

468
00:50:28,392 --> 00:50:29,814
We need to fight the case, right?

469
00:50:31,728 --> 00:50:32,547
Come.

470
00:50:34,364 --> 00:50:35,205
Ancy!

471
00:50:35,432 --> 00:50:37,127
So you didn't get the
money I had arranged for?

472
00:50:38,769 --> 00:50:40,316
Enough! Come here.
- Ancy! Leave me.

473
00:50:40,637 --> 00:50:42,207
Don't trouble us.
- Ancy!

474
00:50:42,539 --> 00:50:43,585
Come here.
Let her go.

475
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:08,959
Simon bro, will your
wife come tomorrow also?

476
00:51:57,547 --> 00:51:58,366
Will you be punished?

477
00:52:00,283 --> 00:52:01,102
Yes.

478
00:52:02,519 --> 00:52:03,338
How many years?

479
00:52:11,294 --> 00:52:12,431
What the f@"# do
you want to know?

480
00:52:13,697 --> 00:52:14,516
30 years,

481
00:52:16,566 --> 00:52:19,342
If it's imprisonment; when you finish &
get out, your wife will be 60 years old.

482
00:52:20,437 --> 00:52:21,426
And your child will be 35.

483
00:52:23,607 --> 00:52:25,006
you will be a liability for them.

484
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:28,561
I'm going to break
free from here anyway.

485
00:52:29,579 --> 00:52:30,420
Come with me.

486
00:52:32,182 --> 00:52:33,547
I know a place where the
police can't reach.

487
00:52:34,684 --> 00:52:35,912
A new life there.

488
00:52:39,122 --> 00:52:40,077
To escape from the jail?

489
00:52:40,457 --> 00:52:41,276
Yes.

490
00:52:44,794 --> 00:52:47,183
Is this why you dragged Udayan to
the ground on the day you came,

491
00:52:47,631 --> 00:52:48,859
and got applause
from the police?

492
00:52:50,467 --> 00:52:51,286
Go to sleep, man!

493
00:53:27,771 --> 00:53:28,635
Hey!

494
00:53:30,707 --> 00:53:32,345
I'll join you.
How do we escape?

495
00:53:35,278 --> 00:53:37,166
I'll tell you how
and when, later.

496
00:53:37,747 --> 00:53:39,408
First we have to
clear this cell.

497
00:53:44,154 --> 00:53:45,382
These guys?

498
00:53:49,793 --> 00:53:51,772
Move this side!

499
00:53:53,563 --> 00:53:55,895
Give me 2 pieces, bro.
- First eat what you got.

500
00:53:56,333 --> 00:53:58,255
I have to eat the rest also, right?
I can't stay hungry.

501
00:53:58,635 --> 00:54:00,182
Hold it properly.

502
00:54:01,571 --> 00:54:03,846
What the hell are you doing?

503
00:54:04,241 --> 00:54:05,378
Didn't you get enough yesterday?

504
00:54:05,709 --> 00:54:07,870
Why? You want to hit
a nail on my head?

505
00:54:08,278 --> 00:54:10,644
Aren't you doing that?
- There's still time!

506
00:54:15,452 --> 00:54:16,555
Get back at him, man.

507
00:54:17,654 --> 00:54:18,473
Finish him.

508
00:54:22,392 --> 00:54:24,849
I'll show you how I'm gonna
hit a nail on your head!

509
00:54:26,296 --> 00:54:27,115
Leave me.

510
00:54:31,268 --> 00:54:32,838
You dog!
Leave me.

511
00:54:33,236 --> 00:54:34,055
Hold him!

512
00:54:50,687 --> 00:54:51,972
Take him away.

513
00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:02,868
Sir, they are beating him to death.
Come & take them away.

514
00:55:03,333 --> 00:55:04,152
You pig!

515
00:55:05,168 --> 00:55:06,533
Move! Move away!

516
00:55:08,672 --> 00:55:10,890
Leave him!

517
00:55:11,374 --> 00:55:14,025
Sir, they are trying to kill me!

518
00:55:14,611 --> 00:55:16,852
- They're trying to kill me, sir.
- Sir! Sir!

519
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:18,942
Not them. It was him
who started it.

520
00:55:19,249 --> 00:55:20,352
Why are you hitting them?

521
00:55:20,617 --> 00:55:22,164
Hit him, sir.
- Move away..

522
00:55:23,386 --> 00:55:25,752
Simon, your end will be at my hands!
Beware!

523
00:55:26,423 --> 00:55:28,471
I'll chop your head off.
- Sir, he's creating trouble here.

524
00:55:29,059 --> 00:55:30,367
I'll finish you, you dog!

525
00:55:30,694 --> 00:55:32,173
Move away, you..

526
00:55:32,629 --> 00:55:34,358
Take them both to cell no. 3.

527
00:55:34,764 --> 00:55:36,720
Leave me, sir.
- Get out.

528
00:55:37,567 --> 00:55:39,296
Walk!
Come out!

529
00:55:39,636 --> 00:55:41,331
You come out, you schmuck!

530
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:45,201
Go inside.

531
00:55:45,542 --> 00:55:48,056
Go inside, all of you!

532
00:56:23,113 --> 00:56:25,035
If you want to keep
staring, why are you here?

533
00:56:25,415 --> 00:56:26,894
Go to your cell!
- Ya. I'll go!

534
00:56:29,986 --> 00:56:31,351
All those who are in our
cell should join us.

535
00:56:32,322 --> 00:56:33,141
Only then we can do it.

536
00:56:43,366 --> 00:56:45,175
Are you planning to
take everyone along?

537
00:56:46,136 --> 00:56:48,297
They are the ones waiting for bail
letters whenever the gate opens.

538
00:56:48,671 --> 00:56:50,400
And you want to convince
all of them & take them?

539
00:56:53,743 --> 00:56:54,584
You rascal!

540
00:56:54,778 --> 00:56:56,734
You made me convinced
thinking about my wife & kid.

541
00:56:57,113 --> 00:56:58,250
And now you're talking
such bullshit?

542
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:01,171
Say something, man!

543
00:57:06,956 --> 00:57:08,787
I'm with you just because I'll
get to see my wife & kid.

544
00:57:11,694 --> 00:57:12,888
Tell me how we're
going to do it!

545
00:57:14,464 --> 00:57:16,648
None of those who may
get bail won't join us.

546
00:57:17,066 --> 00:57:17,885
I know that.

547
00:57:18,535 --> 00:57:20,457
There are other people who
won't get bail like us, right?

548
00:57:22,005 --> 00:57:23,108
We should take such
people with us.

549
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:52,975
Jacob, there's nothing
else to talk about.

550
00:57:54,771 --> 00:57:55,635
We need Charlie.

551
00:57:57,207 --> 00:58:00,096
And those 3.5 crores you
stole from Appachan..

552
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:03,009
What say?

553
00:58:04,647 --> 00:58:06,695
we went our own ways that
night, from Kottayam.

554
00:58:07,383 --> 00:58:08,953
After that, Charlie
hasn't called me.

555
00:58:12,088 --> 00:58:14,101
Go say that to someone else.

556
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:18,279
Understood?

557
00:58:22,532 --> 00:58:25,751
The moment we get him,
you'll get bail.

558
00:58:26,736 --> 00:58:27,896
I want bail at this moment.

559
00:58:29,472 --> 00:58:30,894
Then I'll tell you where he is.

560
00:58:33,142 --> 00:58:33,961
Jacob,

561
00:58:39,516 --> 00:58:42,064
In that suitcase you stole,
didn'tjust have money in it;

562
00:58:47,390 --> 00:58:52,919
and had kept their documents of
plantations, commercial properties, etc.

563
00:58:55,331 --> 00:58:58,346
People are waiting at his
doorstep with the capital amount.

564
00:59:11,948 --> 00:59:13,870
Dude, Appachan is
going to be finished.

565
00:59:14,250 --> 00:59:16,354
So long he was enjoying the wealth
that was supposed to be mine.

566
00:59:17,020 --> 00:59:17,839
Then,

567
00:59:18,154 --> 00:59:19,382
I will leave from
here tonight itself.

568
00:59:19,656 --> 00:59:20,964
My flight is in the
morning tomorrow.

569
00:59:21,724 --> 00:59:23,237
Dude, tell me..

570
00:59:26,129 --> 00:59:27,380
I don't know that, sir.

571
00:59:30,133 --> 00:59:31,088
You know that.

572
00:59:35,705 --> 00:59:38,629
Wherever you hide your wife,

573
00:59:39,275 --> 00:59:40,503
Appachan will find her.

574
00:59:47,684 --> 00:59:48,969
Did you hear that, Yakob?

575
01:00:07,704 --> 01:00:08,523
Hey!

576
01:00:09,205 --> 01:00:10,024
Why did the lawyer come?

577
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:11,971
Are you also going out on bail?
- No.

578
01:00:12,275 --> 01:00:14,231
Then? Did he come to see
if you were doing good?

579
01:00:14,611 --> 01:00:16,181
They have fixed the
date to bump me off.

580
01:00:16,546 --> 01:00:18,093
He came to tell me that.
- To kill you?

581
01:00:30,126 --> 01:00:32,811
I was the manager of Appachan, who
runs a finance company in Kottayam.

582
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:34,948
And Charlie was the driver there.

583
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:38,064
I want it to be done.

584
01:00:38,301 --> 01:00:39,586
Or else, I know what to do.

585
01:00:40,069 --> 01:00:41,991
There's another face to
Appachan that many don't know.

586
01:00:42,338 --> 01:00:43,976
Another face that demands
an eye for an eye.

587
01:00:44,307 --> 01:00:46,958
If God blesses us, me and PK
will be in Australia next month.

588
01:00:47,443 --> 01:00:48,899
Are you leaving
without telling him?

589
01:00:49,312 --> 01:00:50,620
Go there and give his money.

590
01:00:53,683 --> 01:00:55,514
Charlie joined Appachan, to
take revenge against him;.

591
01:00:57,620 --> 01:00:59,258
He is waiting for a
right opportunity.

592
01:00:59,589 --> 01:01:01,193
You know what he did
to my father, right?

593
01:01:01,524 --> 01:01:03,253
lfl get a chance, I'll go
only after killing him.

594
01:01:20,610 --> 01:01:22,441
Jojichayan's interest has
been pending for 3 months.

595
01:01:23,012 --> 01:01:25,025
Take his wife and kid
to our guest house.

596
01:01:46,035 --> 01:01:48,367
I saw Betty for the first time along
with the Sister from the orphanage,

597
01:01:48,771 --> 01:01:50,466
during Mother Mary's festival.

598
01:01:51,174 --> 01:01:52,914
We liked each other a lot.

599
01:01:53,242 --> 01:01:54,197
What's happening, Betty?

600
01:01:55,144 --> 01:01:55,963
What to say..

601
01:01:56,345 --> 01:01:57,949
Mother is firm on her stand.

602
01:01:58,281 --> 01:01:59,828
There's no change
in their decision.

603
01:02:00,183 --> 01:02:01,992
Jacob, you should marry
her as soon as possible.

604
01:02:02,318 --> 01:02:03,979
She can't stay at the convent
anymore without becoming a nun.

605
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:05,548
That SI is out on bail.

606
01:02:06,189 --> 01:02:08,054
He came to the convent a couple
of times looking for her.

607
01:02:09,158 --> 01:02:11,206
I'll make arrangements to register
our marriage immediately.

608
01:02:12,061 --> 01:02:13,517
And about the SI,
let's see what can be done.

609
01:02:15,531 --> 01:02:16,452
We'll meet in the evening.

610
01:02:17,233 --> 01:02:18,074
Sister..

611
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:29,886
I am at college junction now.

612
01:02:30,446 --> 01:02:31,549
- At the bus stop..
- lsha..

613
01:02:32,381 --> 01:02:33,803
Class will be over at 4 PM.

614
01:02:35,284 --> 01:02:36,569
No. Sister said she'll meet me.

615
01:02:37,620 --> 01:02:38,439
I don't know.

616
01:02:41,691 --> 01:02:44,148
lsha went missing ever
since she went in his car.

617
01:02:44,594 --> 01:02:47,313
Everything changed, on that evening
when SI James came into our lives.

618
01:02:47,797 --> 01:02:49,276
Hey! You haven't seen anything.

619
01:02:50,032 --> 01:02:50,669
You don't know anything.

620
01:02:51,167 --> 01:02:52,395
Just say what I ask you to say.

621
01:02:53,236 --> 01:02:55,750
Or else, you'll also disappear
the same way she disappeared.

622
01:02:56,172 --> 01:02:56,991
Get lost.

623
01:02:59,575 --> 01:03:02,203
Based on Betty's statement,
SI James was arrested.

624
01:03:03,179 --> 01:03:05,727
As he got suspended,
he was really furious.

625
01:03:06,282 --> 01:03:07,829
He started torturing Betty.

626
01:03:08,184 --> 01:03:09,412
You b@$ch!
- Leave me.

627
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:12,449
You thought I'll rot in jail?

628
01:03:12,989 --> 01:03:14,035
Daughter of a b@$!%

629
01:04:03,673 --> 01:04:05,243
Move!

630
01:04:07,009 --> 01:04:08,112
I will jump from here.

631
01:04:10,246 --> 01:04:11,144
What is it, Jacob?

632
01:04:13,082 --> 01:04:13,901
Charlie,

633
01:04:19,989 --> 01:04:21,911
Did anyone see?
- No. You come here fast.

634
01:04:22,458 --> 01:04:24,267
Shall we get an ambulance to
take him to the hospital?

635
01:04:25,194 --> 01:04:27,674
Is he your brother-in-law to take him
to the hospital in an ambulance?

636
01:04:28,197 --> 01:04:30,153
Do one thing.
Come to the office. I'll wait there.

637
01:04:32,301 --> 01:04:33,120
Let's go.

638
01:04:36,239 --> 01:04:37,058
Jacob!

639
01:04:40,009 --> 01:04:40,646
Where is Betty?

640
01:04:41,177 --> 01:04:42,872
I dropped her at the convent.
What is it, Charlie?

641
01:04:43,212 --> 01:04:45,077
Nothing. Give me the key.
- Why do you want to open the office now?

642
01:04:45,414 --> 01:04:46,984
He's still on the road.
Shouldn't we do something?

643
01:04:47,283 --> 01:04:48,147
He must be dead now.

644
01:04:48,384 --> 01:04:49,931
I know what to do.
Give me the key.

645
01:04:50,219 --> 01:04:51,231
Charlie..
- Move!

646
01:04:52,021 --> 01:04:52,658
Charlie!

647
01:04:54,624 --> 01:04:56,194
What are you doing?

648
01:04:59,595 --> 01:05:01,335
Appachan is responsible
for our state.

649
01:05:01,697 --> 01:05:02,857
Move!
- Listen to me.

650
01:05:04,567 --> 01:05:06,706
This is mine.
It belongs to my father.

651
01:05:07,069 --> 01:05:09,310
You don't know. It's a murder case.
Notjust you, even Betty will be caught.

652
01:05:09,739 --> 01:05:10,933
We have to leave tonight itself.

653
01:05:46,208 --> 01:05:48,039
Hey thief Devassy,
do you have Beedis?

654
01:05:50,579 --> 01:05:51,591
But she didn't give me.

655
01:05:53,683 --> 01:05:55,412
Didn't you say that you
won't come back here again?

656
01:05:56,218 --> 01:05:57,822
My dear sir, I made a blunder this time.

657
01:05:59,488 --> 01:06:00,352
A thief is always a thief.

658
01:06:00,589 --> 01:06:02,363
You'll be in here for quite
some time for this case.

659
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:05,358
Keep the tea there.

660
01:06:05,962 --> 01:06:06,974
Won't even let me wash my mouth.

661
01:06:10,333 --> 01:06:11,903
Simon..
- Sign here, I say!

662
01:06:14,470 --> 01:06:15,289
He's perfect for us.

663
01:06:16,072 --> 01:06:17,084
He'll stand by us.

664
01:06:19,742 --> 01:06:22,222
Simon, we are leaving.
- Okay.

665
01:06:22,678 --> 01:06:23,929
See you when I get out.
- Get out.

666
01:06:25,348 --> 01:06:26,417
Why are you in a hurry?

667
01:06:26,749 --> 01:06:28,387
Lukochan, what plans
after going home?

668
01:06:34,457 --> 01:06:35,526
- Hey thief!
- Hey mad man, move!

669
01:06:35,758 --> 01:06:36,918
Give me a beedi, man!

670
01:06:38,561 --> 01:06:39,550
Simon!
- Devassy!

671
01:06:39,996 --> 01:06:40,985
What is it, Devassy?

672
01:06:43,532 --> 01:06:45,454
Move. I'll tell you.
- Give me a beedi, man!

673
01:06:46,135 --> 01:06:48,000
Just one beedi.
- I'll give you, man!

674
01:06:52,108 --> 01:06:54,156
Don't take the beedis
away, you bloody thief!

675
01:06:55,277 --> 01:06:57,416
You keep adding more people
and keep saying that we'll go;

676
01:07:00,216 --> 01:07:01,285
I'll tell you when it's time.

677
01:07:01,550 --> 01:07:03,211
You've been saying
this for so many days.

678
01:07:03,552 --> 01:07:05,656
Hey! You can do all
this back in your cell.

679
01:07:08,724 --> 01:07:10,180
- Keep it here.
- Get lost.

680
01:07:13,462 --> 01:07:15,703
Bro, why don't you
slap right on his face?

681
01:07:16,499 --> 01:07:17,318
You get lost!

682
01:07:18,968 --> 01:07:20,856
Bro, can you give me
dope for one beedi?

683
01:07:22,271 --> 01:07:23,135
Get lost!

684
01:07:25,541 --> 01:07:26,360
Get lost, I say!

685
01:07:41,457 --> 01:07:43,004
Stop dealing with
that Ottayan guy.

686
01:07:51,467 --> 01:07:52,866
Oh dear.
I can't give it.

687
01:07:56,505 --> 01:07:57,403
Can you give me that blade?

688
01:07:59,341 --> 01:08:00,091
Blade..

689
01:08:05,548 --> 01:08:07,095
Some of us are planning
to escape from here.

690
01:08:08,284 --> 01:08:09,103
Wanna join?

691
01:08:16,525 --> 01:08:18,334
Dude, if all of you guys leave,

692
01:08:19,161 --> 01:08:20,298
I will be alone here, right?

693
01:08:27,336 --> 01:08:29,702
There's a railway time table at
the Superintendent's office.

694
01:08:30,706 --> 01:08:32,253
Come to our cell with that.

695
01:08:44,987 --> 01:08:45,646
What?

696
01:08:50,092 --> 01:08:50,956
What's the case?

697
01:08:53,696 --> 01:08:55,300
And stabbed the contractor
in his gut, right?

698
01:09:00,936 --> 01:09:03,894
You came for work from
Bengal & stabbed a guy;

699
01:09:04,373 --> 01:09:06,261
and now you want to
mess with the wardens?

700
01:09:06,675 --> 01:09:08,723
How dare you raise
your hands on us?

701
01:09:09,111 --> 01:09:11,159
I'll chop your hands off!
- Leave him, sir.

702
01:09:11,514 --> 01:09:12,333
No, sir.

703
01:09:12,548 --> 01:09:13,879
What did you think?
- Leave him, sir.

704
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:15,788
Sir, we have to
present him in court.

705
01:09:17,186 --> 01:09:18,005
Leave me.

706
01:09:18,220 --> 01:09:19,039
Lock him up in the cell.

707
01:09:31,167 --> 01:09:31,986
Go to sleep.

708
01:09:34,503 --> 01:09:35,902
I want to tell you something.

709
01:09:40,476 --> 01:09:42,137
The blade that you
gave to cut nails,

710
01:09:43,179 --> 01:09:45,807
those guys got back to cell
no.8 without returning it.

711
01:09:48,317 --> 01:09:49,978
That Bengali whom you
beat up in the morning;

712
01:09:50,653 --> 01:09:52,132
his back is all wounded.

713
01:09:55,391 --> 01:09:57,052
When he's taken to court
to renew the remand,

714
01:09:57,459 --> 01:10:00,235
they have planned to show him to the
judge and complain against you.

715
01:10:01,263 --> 01:10:03,720
If he complains, then I don't have
to tell you what will happen, right?

716
01:10:05,568 --> 01:10:06,853
Because he's a Bengali, right?

717
01:10:08,404 --> 01:10:10,008
Let him do whatever he wants.
Why do you care?

718
01:10:10,306 --> 01:10:11,967
Bloody..

719
01:10:12,374 --> 01:10:14,945
I will hang you upside down here.
- Then hang me!

720
01:10:19,481 --> 01:10:20,493
I'll get back to you later.

721
01:10:26,188 --> 01:10:28,019
Send that Bengali
here with an ointment.

722
01:10:56,318 --> 01:10:57,888
What lame behaviour is this!

723
01:10:59,622 --> 01:11:01,487
Lasar, you can apply
it on your head.

724
01:11:02,057 --> 01:11:03,308
You don't have to apply
it on your body.

725
01:11:09,732 --> 01:11:12,769
I'm pouring it, right? Let me also
apply some. It won't get over.

726
01:11:13,302 --> 01:11:15,258
The oil to apply on our heads;
you're pouring it on your body?

727
01:11:15,604 --> 01:11:17,845
Did you bring this oil
from your house, you dog?

728
01:11:18,340 --> 01:11:19,887
Who's that?
- Don't hit me.

729
01:11:20,242 --> 01:11:22,290
Sir, these guys are hitting me.

730
01:11:22,678 --> 01:11:24,373
Sir, see. They are hitting me.

731
01:11:29,551 --> 01:11:31,769
Sir, don't push from behind.
Can't you see that I'm walking?

732
01:11:33,656 --> 01:11:35,840
Go inside. Rest of the
story you can say inside.

733
01:11:38,627 --> 01:11:39,548
Go inside.

734
01:11:40,229 --> 01:11:43,027
He started fighting for no reason;
just because I applied oil on my body.

735
01:11:43,532 --> 01:11:45,955
Oil is for everyone, sir.
Did he bring it from his wife's house?

736
01:11:46,402 --> 01:11:47,357
Will your dad bring it?

737
01:11:47,569 --> 01:11:48,638
Did you bring it
from your house?

738
01:11:49,204 --> 01:11:51,388
Sir, he was the one who started it.
- I'll slap you.

739
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:53,445
Sir, I didn't do anything.

740
01:11:54,610 --> 01:11:56,248
Why do you even
bother stopping them?

741
01:11:58,380 --> 01:11:59,426
Don't create any more troubles.

742
01:12:01,050 --> 01:12:02,415
Sir, I won't go there.

743
01:12:05,721 --> 01:12:07,416
They will kill me when I'm asleep.
- Don't point your finger.

744
01:12:07,756 --> 01:12:08,575
Which cell are you in?

745
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:13,289
Sir, I can't go to cell no. 4.

746
01:12:13,629 --> 01:12:15,369
His friend is there.
That murderer Udayan.

747
01:12:15,698 --> 01:12:17,768
He will kill me, sir.
It's better that I sit here.

748
01:12:18,167 --> 01:12:20,055
- Then why don't you sit there?
- Okay sir.

749
01:12:20,436 --> 01:12:21,255
You..

750
01:12:25,341 --> 01:12:26,535
He wants to sit on my seat!

751
01:12:31,747 --> 01:12:36,525
'There's sardine fry;
and there's Karimeen fry'

752
01:12:37,286 --> 01:12:41,438
'And there's some nice
prawn curry with tamarind'

753
01:12:43,359 --> 01:12:45,281
We'll leave once he also comes, right?
- Yes. We'll go.

754
01:12:49,231 --> 01:12:50,300
What do we do with this mad guy?

755
01:12:52,801 --> 01:12:53,620
I'll tell you.

756
01:12:54,269 --> 01:12:56,225
Don't say that. Tell me and go.
- I said I'll tell you..

757
01:13:08,317 --> 01:13:09,136
Hey Girijan,

758
01:13:09,485 --> 01:13:11,214
leave alone madness, you don't
even have a headache.

759
01:13:12,121 --> 01:13:13,190
All this is your acting, right?

760
01:13:15,457 --> 01:13:16,879
If you say that to the officers,

761
01:13:17,559 --> 01:13:18,867
I don't give a damn!

762
01:13:20,229 --> 01:13:21,560
But your plan to
escape from the jail,

763
01:13:24,333 --> 01:13:25,152
Wanna see that?

764
01:13:27,102 --> 01:13:28,091
This is Girijan.

765
01:13:30,406 --> 01:13:31,475
Are you coming along with us?

766
01:13:32,074 --> 01:13:33,905
Why?
Won't you like it if! come along?

767
01:13:35,043 --> 01:13:37,352
Then Girijan, from tomorrow,
you will be totally nuts!

768
01:13:41,283 --> 01:13:46,903
'Let's sing and dance and jump around'

769
01:13:49,091 --> 01:13:49,932
Get in.

770
01:14:17,486 --> 01:14:19,147
Hey Beedi thief!
Where's the beedi for me?

771
01:14:20,055 --> 01:14:22,626
'I smoked your Beedi'

772
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:27,165
'I smoked your beedi'

773
01:14:27,596 --> 01:14:29,871
'You took my beedi,
I smoked your beedi'

774
01:14:31,700 --> 01:14:33,099
lwill kill him, Simon bro!

775
01:14:35,137 --> 01:14:35,956
Mad man!

776
01:14:54,456 --> 01:14:55,275
Jacob,

777
01:14:56,024 --> 01:14:58,072
you didn't tell us how we're
going to escape from here.

778
01:15:00,028 --> 01:15:01,040
You'll tell what?

779
01:15:01,630 --> 01:15:04,315
You're making us fools by saying
that you'll tell later?

780
01:15:08,203 --> 01:15:10,034
Simon . .
- Move, Devassy.

781
01:15:11,406 --> 01:15:12,862
I'll kick you..

782
01:15:17,646 --> 01:15:19,864
I'll get the same punishment
even if! kill one more guy!

783
01:15:20,449 --> 01:15:22,405
Simon, the policemen are coming.

784
01:15:31,493 --> 01:15:32,312
Leave me!

785
01:16:07,195 --> 01:16:08,116
Stand there.

786
01:16:09,131 --> 01:16:10,143
Bloody b@#@%@%

787
01:16:10,465 --> 01:16:11,796
Where is it?
Take it!

788
01:16:12,234 --> 01:16:13,974
Take it, I say.

789
01:16:14,336 --> 01:16:16,224
Where is it kept?
- Take it.

790
01:16:16,605 --> 01:16:18,243
Take it out fast.

791
01:16:23,579 --> 01:16:25,945
Come out, you..

792
01:16:28,083 --> 01:16:30,039
Bloody son of a b@$%!

793
01:16:30,586 --> 01:16:32,895
You thought the policemen
here are fools?

794
01:16:34,356 --> 01:16:37,041
I'll put and end
to your stay here.

795
01:16:37,693 --> 01:16:39,024
What did you think about me?

796
01:16:47,603 --> 01:16:48,558
Walk!

797
01:16:50,305 --> 01:16:51,124
This is your end!

798
01:17:35,183 --> 01:17:37,981
'lnterval'

799
01:18:40,124 --> 01:18:41,455
Sir, where is he being taken to?

800
01:18:42,994 --> 01:18:44,507
He's being taken to
Ponkunnam sub jail now.

801
01:19:28,172 --> 01:19:29,901
It's been so long since you
promised to get me out.

802
01:19:30,208 --> 01:19:32,517
They're not letting me out of the
cell even to collect my lunch.

803
01:19:32,944 --> 01:19:35,629
You need to get bail, right?
There's such a strong case against you.

804
01:19:36,147 --> 01:19:38,217
Wait for some more days.
- Enough. Get back to your cell.

805
01:19:38,616 --> 01:19:39,571
Coming, sir.

806
01:20:18,656 --> 01:20:20,544
It's an awesome song, sir.
Jassie gift's song.

807
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:23,779
It's Jacob, sir.

808
01:20:26,664 --> 01:20:27,585
I think so, sir.

809
01:20:29,900 --> 01:20:33,529
'He's gone, my dear'

810
01:21:09,940 --> 01:21:12,306
Dude, are you planning
to get us killed?

811
01:21:13,444 --> 01:21:15,253
If they hear a sound, they'll sleep
only after finding where it came from.

812
01:21:15,613 --> 01:21:16,659
And you want to break
the floor now?

813
01:21:26,757 --> 01:21:28,713
Sir! Sir!
- What is it?

814
01:21:29,427 --> 01:21:30,826
Play music, sir!
Music!

815
01:21:33,197 --> 01:21:34,482
Don't shout.
We'll play it.

816
01:21:37,168 --> 01:21:38,715
Hey! Play some music for them.

817
01:22:23,647 --> 01:22:24,466
Over here.

818
01:22:53,411 --> 01:22:55,424
Bro, we can't dig any
further with this knife.

819
01:23:00,618 --> 01:23:02,313
Put these rocks back
to the pit itself.

820
01:23:10,594 --> 01:23:12,164
Haven't I told you not
to call during night?

821
01:23:33,117 --> 01:23:35,221
Mooppan, do we have work inside or outside?
- No work here.

822
01:23:35,686 --> 01:23:36,607
Bring some wood.

823
01:23:36,854 --> 01:23:38,401
And peel the coconuts
that are lying there.

824
01:25:14,418 --> 01:25:15,521
It's okay here.
You carry on.

825
01:26:01,632 --> 01:26:02,451
Sir..

826
01:26:04,034 --> 01:26:05,433
My foot hit a rock.

827
01:26:06,537 --> 01:26:07,788
Oh! That looks quite bad.

828
01:26:09,907 --> 01:26:11,420
You want to go to the hospital?
- No sir.

829
01:26:11,742 --> 01:26:13,790
Just send me to my cell.
- Prabhakaran, take him to his cell.

830
01:26:16,981 --> 01:26:17,800
Sir..

831
01:27:19,777 --> 01:27:21,790
What happened?
- My foot hit a rock, sir.

832
01:27:22,146 --> 01:27:22,965
Hold this.

833
01:27:23,380 --> 01:27:24,017
Show me.
Let me see.

834
01:27:24,381 --> 01:27:26,337
You want to go to the hospital?
- No sir. It's all right.

835
01:27:26,784 --> 01:27:27,603
It's all right, sir.

836
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:30,339
Then go to your cell.

837
01:28:08,425 --> 01:28:09,653
If he has taken a
crowbar inside,

838
01:28:10,661 --> 01:28:13,118
that is to break the cell.
No doubt about that.

839
01:28:16,033 --> 01:28:17,489
Shut up, you pig!

840
01:28:18,769 --> 01:28:20,316
Your damned song!

841
01:30:08,512 --> 01:30:09,968
The tunnel that goes
outside from the bathroom;

842
01:30:14,184 --> 01:30:15,583
10-12 metres long?

843
01:30:18,155 --> 01:30:20,168
There's a drainage that
passes behind the wall,

844
01:30:22,492 --> 01:30:23,857
That's where we should
take the tunnel to.

845
01:30:24,161 --> 01:30:27,289
The right end of it is at
the CRPF office compound.

846
01:30:28,131 --> 01:30:29,530
We just have to reach
that drainage.

847
01:30:32,569 --> 01:30:34,582
'They are coming'

848
01:30:35,038 --> 01:30:36,050
Hey! It's 9 o'clock.

849
01:30:39,443 --> 01:30:40,080
Just one beedi.

850
01:30:44,915 --> 01:30:46,610
So we won't have to
jump over the walls,

851
01:30:48,151 --> 01:30:49,698
Yes. We can avoid that wall.

852
01:30:55,125 --> 01:30:55,944
h ey.

853
01:30:59,763 --> 01:31:01,594
I know that you're planning
to break free from the jail.

854
01:31:06,536 --> 01:31:08,640
When you're on top of the
wall for your final jump,

855
01:31:10,507 --> 01:31:11,519
I'll pull you down!

856
01:31:32,729 --> 01:31:33,957
Don't push, sir.
- Go!

857
01:31:39,569 --> 01:31:40,763
Don't push, sir.
- Where are you going?

858
01:31:41,104 --> 01:31:42,389
You're in the next one.
Come here.

859
01:31:43,006 --> 01:31:44,610
Leave me, sir.
I'll go to that one, sir.

860
01:31:44,942 --> 01:31:46,512
- I want to be there.
- What are you looking at?

861
01:32:06,964 --> 01:32:07,805
What's your name?

862
01:32:08,598 --> 01:32:09,826
Rajesh.
- And the other guy's?

863
01:32:10,467 --> 01:32:11,798
Ramesh.
- Why aren't you eating?

864
01:32:12,069 --> 01:32:12,888
I'm not hungry.

865
01:32:13,637 --> 01:32:14,456
Shall I take it?

866
01:32:16,773 --> 01:32:17,592
Don't eat now.

867
01:32:19,509 --> 01:32:20,328
Hey kiddo,

868
01:32:20,777 --> 01:32:22,347
If you fall sick here by
refusing to eat food,

869
01:32:22,713 --> 01:32:25,750
the officers won't ask 'Oh dear! What
happened, son?' and send you out.

870
01:32:26,483 --> 01:32:27,302
Understood?

871
01:32:29,553 --> 01:32:30,372
Eat it.

872
01:32:35,492 --> 01:32:36,595
We were cheated, brother.

873
01:32:38,695 --> 01:32:40,208
We thought it was
a cardamom sack.

874
01:32:48,672 --> 01:32:49,684
Just our aunt..

875
01:32:53,477 --> 01:32:55,490
Don't you want to get back
& take revenge on them?

876
01:32:55,879 --> 01:32:57,619
I don't want to take revenge
on anyone, brother.

877
01:33:07,424 --> 01:33:08,823
Then you go and throw
this somewhere.

878
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:10,579
I'm taking the fish.

879
01:33:11,862 --> 01:33:13,636
You eat all of this.
- Thanks.

880
01:33:22,139 --> 01:33:23,037
We need to get rid of him.

881
01:33:32,482 --> 01:33:34,177
Come!
Hold it closer.

882
01:33:34,718 --> 01:33:36,322
Hold the plate lower.

883
01:33:37,687 --> 01:33:38,642
Did you do push ups today?

884
01:33:38,922 --> 01:33:40,526
- Stretch out the plates.
- No, chetta.

885
01:33:41,858 --> 01:33:42,927
Chetta, serve some more.

886
01:33:43,727 --> 01:33:45,365
This is not for
you alone to eat.

887
01:33:45,695 --> 01:33:46,923
There are others here. Get going.
- Why?

888
01:33:47,364 --> 01:33:48,820
Won't others get enough
if you give me some more?

889
01:33:49,132 --> 01:33:50,827
Sir, take him away.
- Hey twin piece!

890
01:33:51,501 --> 01:33:52,661
Take whatever you
got & suck on it.

891
01:33:52,936 --> 01:33:53,891
Don't call me that again, sir.

892
01:33:54,137 --> 01:33:55,616
What will you do if! call?
- I'll slap you.

893
01:33:56,940 --> 01:33:58,510
Ya! I'll slap you!
- B@$@$!%

894
01:33:59,576 --> 01:34:00,395
Will you slap policemen?

895
01:34:00,844 --> 01:34:02,653
You sold marijuana and
talking too much here?

896
01:34:02,979 --> 01:34:04,458
Sir, don't him him.
He's innocent, sir.

897
01:34:04,781 --> 01:34:06,294
Sir, no.
Please.

898
01:34:06,650 --> 01:34:07,958
Sir, leave him.

899
01:34:08,418 --> 01:34:10,192
- Move away.
- Let me tell you. Come.

900
01:34:10,554 --> 01:34:11,782
Sir, come.

901
01:34:13,056 --> 01:34:14,785
Sir, come.
Please.

902
01:34:16,626 --> 01:34:17,672
Don't make it a big issue.

903
01:34:17,894 --> 01:34:19,225
Their section is different.

904
01:34:19,496 --> 01:34:21,236
Your kids might be
in trouble outside.

905
01:34:22,432 --> 01:34:23,854
You don't need to have
your damn lunch now.

906
01:34:24,167 --> 01:34:26,146
Hey Rajesh.
Go to the cell. Go.

907
01:34:26,503 --> 01:34:27,811
Hey! Get going.
- Sir,

908
01:34:28,538 --> 01:34:30,722
shall I get some beedis from cell no.
2? Beedis are over.

909
01:34:36,179 --> 01:34:36,998
Hey!

910
01:34:38,148 --> 01:34:39,046
You have a beedi with you?

911
01:35:04,107 --> 01:35:07,577
How is Appachan's new idea, sir?

912
01:35:08,912 --> 01:35:09,731
Advocate,

913
01:35:12,115 --> 01:35:13,719
It is to torture a guy, right?

914
01:35:15,619 --> 01:35:18,099
I'm not waiting to get retired.
I'll go on leave.

915
01:35:19,122 --> 01:35:22,592
Then you can do your import or
export or whatever you want.

916
01:35:24,594 --> 01:35:25,788
Well, shall I try
talking to him?

917
01:35:28,465 --> 01:35:30,387
Unnecessary troubles..

918
01:35:34,037 --> 01:35:35,777
Sir..
- Then shall I? - Okay.

919
01:35:41,411 --> 01:35:43,185
Do you understand
what we're saying?

920
01:35:46,049 --> 01:35:48,381
What's going to happen, won't
be under our control..

921
01:35:57,027 --> 01:35:57,846
What?

922
01:36:11,141 --> 01:36:14,269
Can you solve this problem
according to what Appachan said?

923
01:36:16,513 --> 01:36:17,707
First get me bail.

924
01:36:27,924 --> 01:36:29,471
Inmates awaiting trial like you.

925
01:36:30,427 --> 01:36:31,712
They will come to
your cell soon.

926
01:36:36,766 --> 01:36:37,960
So this arrogance of yours..

927
01:36:39,669 --> 01:36:41,307
it will finish you!

928
01:36:59,823 --> 01:37:01,302
Stand in queue.
Where are you going?

929
01:37:03,760 --> 01:37:05,682
Shall I give it and come?
- Okay. Go fast.

930
01:37:23,113 --> 01:37:24,364
The police is watching.

931
01:37:25,615 --> 01:37:27,219
They are all watching.

932
01:37:32,722 --> 01:37:35,054
It's so hot. You're
serving such hot tea?

933
01:37:35,492 --> 01:37:42,898
(indistinct arguments)

934
01:37:44,034 --> 01:37:45,808
Don't you know that he is mad?

935
01:37:46,169 --> 01:37:49,184
Sir, no.
Please.

936
01:37:49,706 --> 01:37:50,525
Get inside.

937
01:37:56,446 --> 01:37:57,083
Go fast.

938
01:38:00,583 --> 01:38:01,402
Go! Go!

939
01:38:13,997 --> 01:38:19,003
(counting)

940
01:38:20,003 --> 01:38:21,834
20.. 10.. 30..

941
01:38:25,542 --> 01:38:27,646
Hello! What game were you
talking about earlier?

942
01:38:29,713 --> 01:38:31,692
A jail escape game.
- I'm not in for that game.

943
01:38:32,882 --> 01:38:34,770
How many kilos of marijuana
was caught with you? - 30.

944
01:38:41,024 --> 01:38:42,070
Even if you know or not,

945
01:38:42,525 --> 01:38:44,573
to confirm that it was
indeed Marijuana with you,

946
01:38:44,994 --> 01:38:47,679
and that it was caught from
you only, the police have..

947
01:38:48,164 --> 01:38:49,586
'Let's sing & dance!
Daddy is here'

948
01:38:49,866 --> 01:38:51,413
Hey scumbag, you're
damn irritating today!

949
01:38:51,701 --> 01:38:54,329
Sir, they're planning to escape
from here & go to Bengal.

950
01:38:54,938 --> 01:38:56,803
Then you get married to his
sister & settle down there.

951
01:38:59,442 --> 01:39:00,773
'Let's go! Let's go!‘

952
01:39:01,044 --> 01:39:03,205
Ya. You'll Ge going to a
mental hospital soon.

953
01:39:04,614 --> 01:39:06,753
The police have arranged 2
people who saw it as witnesses.

954
01:39:07,684 --> 01:39:09,754
When it's time, they
will come to the court,

955
01:39:10,153 --> 01:39:11,700
point at you both &
give their statements

956
01:39:15,592 --> 01:39:17,321
Will you have that much
money with you, Ramesh?

957
01:39:25,969 --> 01:39:27,539
if you pay 1 lakh per kilo,

958
01:39:29,606 --> 01:39:31,654
Do you have the money
to pay 1 lakh per kilo?

959
01:39:35,712 --> 01:39:38,579
You'll have to spend all your life in the
central jail for something you didn't do.

960
01:39:40,016 --> 01:39:41,381
Do you want to waste your life?

961
01:39:42,085 --> 01:39:42,904
Come with us.

962
01:39:47,891 --> 01:39:50,075
But I have a brother here. We
have to take him also with us.

963
01:39:57,600 --> 01:39:59,556
Sir, what can we do if
the minister is coming?

964
01:40:01,471 --> 01:40:02,335
It's not that.

965
01:40:02,539 --> 01:40:04,404
It's not just independence day,
it's the jail anniversary as well.

966
01:40:04,808 --> 01:40:05,627
Hey!
- Sir..

967
01:40:05,909 --> 01:40:08,707
Let's make these guys sing and dance,
and impress the minister.

968
01:40:14,617 --> 01:40:17,245
Instead of bringing every new guy here,
can't you send them to other cells?

969
01:40:17,787 --> 01:40:18,833
What is his case?
- Go inside.

970
01:40:19,122 --> 01:40:20,896
What? Should we explain his case to you?
Go inside!

971
01:40:21,491 --> 01:40:22,628
That won't be necessary now.

972
01:40:22,926 --> 01:40:24,325
Devils are ruling Kerala now.

973
01:40:24,828 --> 01:40:26,568
That's why an army man
like me had this fate.

974
01:40:29,466 --> 01:40:31,206
It's true that I had a couple
of drinks in the train.

975
01:40:31,568 --> 01:40:32,796
But I didn't create any ruckus.

976
01:41:02,432 --> 01:41:03,069
Can you see?

977
01:41:16,880 --> 01:41:18,541
I think it's the pipe that
goes to the drainage.

978
01:41:19,015 --> 01:41:20,494
This is full of mud.

979
01:41:21,050 --> 01:41:22,563
If so, the drainage will
also be full of mud.

980
01:41:22,986 --> 01:41:25,204
To clear all this, we should
be here for life imprisonment.

981
01:41:25,622 --> 01:41:28,250
We just need to reach the drainage
somehow, removing all the mud in the pipe.

982
01:41:28,725 --> 01:41:31,296
Even if we go through the drainage, we
can get out only inside the compound

983
01:41:31,728 --> 01:41:33,298
We'll have to break
through the wall, Jacob.

984
01:41:38,134 --> 01:41:39,647
If so, we'll find another way.

985
01:41:59,522 --> 01:42:00,659
Where are you off to?
- To piss.

986
01:42:01,024 --> 01:42:02,218
Hold it in for some time.

987
01:42:02,592 --> 01:42:04,287
Hold it in? For what?
Move! - Don't shout.

988
01:42:04,894 --> 01:42:06,293
I'll call them out in some time.

989
01:42:07,397 --> 01:42:08,705
Leave me.
- Didn't I ask you to wait?

990
01:42:09,098 --> 01:42:11,578
What are you guys doing?
- They're not letting me piss, sir.

991
01:42:12,669 --> 01:42:13,977
Who is in there?
- Who is it?

992
01:42:17,006 --> 01:42:18,234
lfl come inside..

993
01:42:18,875 --> 01:42:19,694
Open it..

994
01:42:19,943 --> 01:42:20,864
Won't even sleep at night.

995
01:42:21,077 --> 01:42:22,271
Open it fast..

996
01:42:23,813 --> 01:42:25,292
Damn it..

997
01:42:29,819 --> 01:42:30,888
What were you both doing inside?

998
01:42:31,521 --> 01:42:33,500
What were you doing inside,
not coming out when I called?

999
01:42:35,458 --> 01:42:36,095
What?

1000
01:42:36,726 --> 01:42:37,624
Cat caught your tongue?

1001
01:42:39,529 --> 01:42:40,348
Open it.

1002
01:42:40,530 --> 01:42:41,349
Sir..

1003
01:42:42,131 --> 01:42:43,860
What is this, sir?
Like you don't know..

1004
01:42:44,634 --> 01:42:46,522
We just went for a round and..

1005
01:42:48,504 --> 01:42:49,459
Is he your wife?

1006
01:42:50,873 --> 01:42:52,352
We were celebrating
our first night.

1007
01:42:53,576 --> 01:42:54,395
Go to sleep.

1008
01:43:01,150 --> 01:43:03,106
Your time has come.
Heard that, my dear?

1009
01:43:08,558 --> 01:43:09,866
Thomas, bring a bucket of water.

1010
01:43:12,095 --> 01:43:15,633
Army man who tried to molest a 7 year old
girl during a train journey, arrested.

1011
01:43:23,506 --> 01:43:24,575
Pour it into that vessel.

1012
01:43:55,505 --> 01:43:56,904
Has the superintendent reached?
- Go fast.

1013
01:44:07,750 --> 01:44:09,229
Hey!

1014
01:44:10,720 --> 01:44:12,676
You should have thought about this
before getting on top of little girls.

1015
01:44:13,022 --> 01:44:14,887
Such cases will surely
get a royal thulp.

1016
01:44:17,560 --> 01:44:18,697
Pick him up.
- Get up.

1017
01:44:19,462 --> 01:44:21,418
Pick him up.
Shift him to cell no. 4

1018
01:46:09,505 --> 01:46:11,427
As part of the Independence
day celebrations,

1019
01:46:12,608 --> 01:46:15,350
we are planning some
celebrations in the jail.

1020
01:46:16,412 --> 01:46:18,687
Many esteemed guests will take
part, including the minister.

1021
01:46:19,782 --> 01:46:21,795
So what all events can be
performed by you guys?

1022
01:46:23,085 --> 01:46:24,336
And who all will do that?

1023
01:46:24,720 --> 01:46:25,641
We want to know that.

1024
01:46:26,389 --> 01:46:27,026
What all can you do?

1025
01:46:27,390 --> 01:46:28,254
Tell me.

1026
01:46:28,558 --> 01:46:29,627
Why are you all silent?

1027
01:46:31,060 --> 01:46:32,800
What can you perform?

1028
01:46:35,131 --> 01:46:35,950
Sir!

1029
01:46:36,432 --> 01:46:39,299
He's a good stage artist. He does
'Kadhaprasangam' (story narration) well.

1030
01:46:39,936 --> 01:46:41,631
'Kadha Prasangam'?
That's nice.

1031
01:46:44,640 --> 01:46:46,187
That's not possible, sir.
- Why?

1032
01:46:47,977 --> 01:46:50,605
I've never presented it alone, sir.
We do it together.

1033
01:46:51,380 --> 01:46:52,893
Who is it?
- His.. - Brother.

1034
01:46:53,516 --> 01:46:55,256
- Brother.
- So you'll do it if he's there?

1035
01:46:56,752 --> 01:46:59,585
But sir, will we have the time
to create a story and practice?

1036
01:47:01,390 --> 01:47:02,027
Sir,

1037
01:47:02,892 --> 01:47:04,371
I have a story with me, sir.
I'll give it.

1038
01:47:04,694 --> 01:47:06,673
I got it from the Sunday Supplement.
It's a funny story.

1039
01:47:07,063 --> 01:47:09,452
By the end of it, you'll
be tired of laughing.

1040
01:47:11,968 --> 01:47:13,697
Which cell are you in?
- Cell No. 2

1041
01:47:14,570 --> 01:47:17,221
Shift him from 2 to 6.
- Then we can do it, sir.

1042
01:47:18,074 --> 01:47:19,803
That's enough, sir.
We'll practice.

1043
01:47:20,142 --> 01:47:21,837
We'll do it in there with
whatever time we have.

1044
01:47:22,144 --> 01:47:24,453
Do any of you know to sing or do
mimicry or anything like that?

1045
01:47:25,448 --> 01:47:28,133
Sir, let's make Girijan sing.
- Sir, I can sing like Yesudas.

1046
01:47:28,618 --> 01:47:30,427
No need.
- Sir, he sings well.

1047
01:47:47,536 --> 01:47:48,787
Stop fooling around & get into the cell.

1048
01:47:55,578 --> 01:47:57,182
The story we're going to
present here is called,

1049
01:48:27,643 --> 01:48:28,803
Make 2 people clean all this.

1050
01:48:29,045 --> 01:48:30,296
For the march..

1051
01:48:31,480 --> 01:48:32,993
Hey! Tie it higher.
- Sir..

1052
01:48:36,786 --> 01:48:37,889
There'll be kids
from juvenile home.

1053
01:48:38,487 --> 01:48:39,886
And the families of the officers.

1054
01:48:40,756 --> 01:48:42,530
Hey! Hey!
Tie it over there.

1055
01:48:43,125 --> 01:48:45,173
There won't be enough space
for chairs for all of them.

1056
01:48:45,561 --> 01:48:47,301
Shift that bus to the backside.
Then we'll have space.

1057
01:48:49,498 --> 01:48:51,272
Manoj, take that bus
to the backside.

1058
01:48:53,069 --> 01:48:55,344
Hey! Hey!
Don't fool around over there.

1059
01:49:00,609 --> 01:49:01,428
Come.

1060
01:49:03,713 --> 01:49:05,442
Turn..
Ya.. Straight..

1061
01:49:05,848 --> 01:49:06,917
Come on.

1062
01:49:07,183 --> 01:49:08,514
Let the other vehicle pass.

1063
01:49:08,784 --> 01:49:09,830
Turn it again.

1064
01:49:11,153 --> 01:49:12,290
Come on.

1065
01:49:17,626 --> 01:49:19,639
You could have come a little
more backwards. - This is fine.

1066
01:49:32,842 --> 01:49:33,661
Did you see?

1067
01:50:32,601 --> 01:50:34,239
3 seconds short of 3 minutes.

1068
01:50:34,703 --> 01:50:36,591
It took only 3 minutes
to go and come back.

1069
01:50:38,174 --> 01:50:39,425
So to go out, 1.5 minutes.

1070
01:50:43,179 --> 01:50:45,750
I can't believe that this dreaded
life will be over tomorrow.

1071
01:50:47,616 --> 01:50:50,358
That's not what I'm sad about.
Our Simon couldn't be with us.

1072
01:50:52,521 --> 01:50:53,920
If we had been careful
when we were outside,

1073
01:50:54,924 --> 01:50:56,698
none of us would have
had to suffer here.

1074
01:50:58,561 --> 01:51:00,631
So if we do things correctly
according to the plan,

1075
01:51:01,897 --> 01:51:03,728
we're going to get a hell
of a lot of freedom!

1076
01:51:05,668 --> 01:51:08,535
We'll leave on the special train
at 3.15 AM tomorrow at dawn.

1077
01:51:09,872 --> 01:51:10,941
We must leave in that.

1078
01:51:11,807 --> 01:51:13,763
Or else, we will have to
wait till next Thursday.

1079
01:51:16,579 --> 01:51:17,534
we should start from here.

1080
01:51:19,715 --> 01:51:21,455
We have only 10 minutes
to reach the station.

1081
01:51:22,918 --> 01:51:25,102
3 minutes to reach below
the wall from here.

1082
01:51:26,021 --> 01:51:28,296
To run to the railway track
from there, another 3 minutes.

1083
01:51:28,924 --> 01:51:30,789
To reach the platform by
running through the tracks,

1084
01:51:33,529 --> 01:51:34,780
So what about the
remaining one minute?

1085
01:53:43,892 --> 01:53:45,632
I don't have any hatred or
grudge against you now.

1086
01:53:54,703 --> 01:53:55,522
That was your skill.

1087
01:53:58,540 --> 01:53:59,825
I'll die in here, man.

1088
01:54:03,679 --> 01:54:04,839
Will you take me
also in your group?

1089
01:54:07,383 --> 01:54:08,020
Are you scared?

1090
01:54:11,387 --> 01:54:12,752
Your case is closed.
Take whatever you need.

1091
01:54:14,390 --> 01:54:16,631
Hey mad man, since you're mad,
the court closed your case quickly.

1092
01:54:19,628 --> 01:54:21,368
Stop fooling around and
come with your stuff.

1093
01:54:22,931 --> 01:54:24,216
Right away.

1094
01:54:25,501 --> 01:54:26,320
Let me take this.

1095
01:54:26,935 --> 01:54:28,573
Bhai, I'm leaving.
- Okay, buddy.

1096
01:54:32,741 --> 01:54:33,560
Jacob..

1097
01:54:33,742 --> 01:54:35,221
Enough.. Come out..
- Bye..

1098
01:54:49,958 --> 01:54:52,324
Girijan, place your
finger and press on it.

1099
01:54:52,728 --> 01:54:54,241
Whose is it?
- Udayan's bail.

1100
01:54:54,530 --> 01:54:56,418
He got bail for his 7th case.

1101
01:54:56,799 --> 01:54:58,687
How many cases does he have?
- He will leave in one week.

1102
01:54:59,068 --> 01:55:01,172
There are people outside
to get him out.

1103
01:55:01,537 --> 01:55:02,549
Let him go!
Headache he is.

1104
01:55:04,139 --> 01:55:05,333
Why?
- I want lunch.

1105
01:55:10,379 --> 01:55:11,516
Keep the cover there and come.

1106
01:55:12,648 --> 01:55:14,604
Will you go out only after lunch?
- I'll eat & go, sir.

1107
01:55:16,785 --> 01:55:19,060
Some fish also, please.

1108
01:55:20,422 --> 01:55:21,787
Hey! Stand here and eat.

1109
01:55:22,157 --> 01:55:24,170
Let me give some fish to Jacob.
- Where?

1110
01:55:24,560 --> 01:55:26,721
Did you come to give him fish?
- I'll give & come back fast, sir.

1111
01:55:27,129 --> 01:55:27,948
Make it fast.

1112
01:55:28,163 --> 01:55:28,982
Go and come back fast.

1113
01:55:30,599 --> 01:55:33,488
Udayan has got bail. He's planning
to finish you. Be careful.

1114
01:55:40,542 --> 01:55:41,383
Okay.

1115
01:55:46,582 --> 01:55:47,401
Hey!

1116
01:55:59,528 --> 01:56:00,347
Jacob,

1117
01:56:00,596 --> 01:56:01,904
that's trouble for you
coming in that bus.

1118
01:56:02,598 --> 01:56:04,145
All are first rate criminals!

1119
01:56:06,001 --> 01:56:07,832
Sir, will you bring them
to the cell today itself?

1120
01:56:08,370 --> 01:56:09,701
They will come to your
cell today itself.

1121
01:56:10,005 --> 01:56:11,870
Tell me if you want to be saved.
I'll talk to sir.

1122
01:56:17,413 --> 01:56:18,926
I'll go, even if! have to kill them.

1123
01:57:37,826 --> 01:57:39,566
Hey! Ram and Devassy, come out.

1124
01:57:40,028 --> 01:57:41,507
Shift them to cell no. 3
- Okay sir.

1125
01:57:46,068 --> 01:57:46,909
Sir,

1126
01:57:47,402 --> 01:57:50,587
Hereafter, I will decide who should stay
in here and who should go out.

1127
01:57:51,640 --> 01:57:53,301
Appachan has given you
money for that as well.

1128
01:57:58,847 --> 01:57:59,859
Take them all inside.

1129
01:58:00,649 --> 01:58:01,468
Move.

1130
01:58:06,188 --> 01:58:07,439
Get in.

1131
01:59:31,740 --> 01:59:32,581
Sir..

1132
01:59:32,774 --> 01:59:33,593
You..

1133
01:59:34,509 --> 01:59:37,546
If you raise your voice, I'll
pierce this through your throat.

1134
01:59:38,146 --> 01:59:39,716
Don't try to mess with me!

1135
02:00:02,137 --> 02:00:02,956
Get down.

1136
02:00:05,040 --> 02:00:06,268
Bring him.

1137
02:00:09,544 --> 02:00:11,557
If you run & board Malabar
express, you can come with us.

1138
02:00:12,180 --> 02:00:13,431
Or go wherever you want to.

1139
02:00:43,578 --> 02:00:45,216
Come!
- Get lost.

1140
02:00:45,547 --> 02:00:46,332
Hey!

1141
02:02:12,768 --> 02:02:13,587
Coming.

1142
02:04:13,989 --> 02:04:14,808
Hey!

1143
02:04:52,894 --> 02:04:54,179
Take the plank.

1144
02:04:58,633 --> 02:04:59,554
Jose, come.

1145
02:05:02,537 --> 02:05:03,526
Pull it up.

1146
02:06:41,069 --> 02:06:41,888
Where are they?

1147
02:06:43,138 --> 02:06:44,617
Come on!

1148
02:06:46,775 --> 02:06:47,594
Go that side.

1149
02:06:50,478 --> 02:06:51,376
Where?

1150
02:06:58,653 --> 02:07:00,757
Sir, not me. It's them.
- Where are they?

1151
02:07:01,523 --> 02:07:04,003
Sir, train! Malabar express.
Over there, sir.

1152
02:07:04,426 --> 02:07:05,529
Hey! Catch him!

1153
02:07:07,629 --> 02:07:09,369
He jumped!
Start the vehicles!

1154
02:07:10,965 --> 02:07:12,535
All of them have jumped.

1155
02:07:18,840 --> 02:07:19,795
Send the wireless message.

1156
02:07:24,913 --> 02:07:26,778
At Kottayam railway station..
Malabar Express..

1157
02:07:27,148 --> 02:07:29,161
Six of them have escaped, sir.

1158
02:07:35,590 --> 02:07:36,409
Don't spare anyone.

1159
02:07:41,463 --> 02:07:43,328
We're coming via the main road, sir.
Yes sir.

1160
02:07:44,399 --> 02:07:46,640
Hey! That way!
Right! Right!

1161
02:07:47,135 --> 02:07:48,705
Tu rn rig ht.

1162
02:07:50,605 --> 02:07:51,424
Hello?

1163
02:07:56,778 --> 02:07:58,507
You go that way.
Rest of you come this way.

1164
02:08:05,120 --> 02:08:05,939
Come.
Let's go there.

1165
02:08:10,758 --> 02:08:11,986
Go to the left.

1166
02:08:16,431 --> 02:08:17,739
Run!

1167
02:08:20,869 --> 02:08:22,291
Two of them have gone this way!

1168
02:08:24,072 --> 02:08:24,891
Stop there!

1169
02:08:39,587 --> 02:08:40,986
Stop there, you..

1170
02:08:43,658 --> 02:08:44,818
One is here.

1171
02:09:34,842 --> 02:09:35,683
Police!

1172
02:10:05,406 --> 02:10:06,862
Jacob, stop there!

1173
02:10:32,166 --> 02:10:33,030
Come here, you..

1174
02:10:55,523 --> 02:10:57,411
This side!
Come on!

1175
02:10:57,792 --> 02:10:58,895
Kick him!

1176
02:10:59,727 --> 02:11:00,716
Go! Go!

1177
02:11:01,863 --> 02:11:02,682
Go!

1178
02:11:08,136 --> 02:11:09,501
Come on!

1179
02:11:13,975 --> 02:11:14,794
Ramesh!

1180
02:11:16,811 --> 02:11:19,996
Ramesh, get up!

1181
02:11:20,848 --> 02:11:21,985
Hey! Hey!

1182
02:11:33,161 --> 02:11:34,446
Leave me.

1183
02:11:55,116 --> 02:11:56,845
Sir, he is here.
Come here.

1184
02:13:15,096 --> 02:13:15,915
John, move it closer.

1185
02:13:54,869 --> 02:13:57,929
After escaping from the jail, I
went straight to find my Betty.

1186
02:13:58,873 --> 02:14:01,671
Even though it was difficult, I saved
her from there with Murugan's help.

1187
02:14:03,444 --> 02:14:06,163
Devassy and Ramu will reach
Bengal within 2-3 days.

1188
02:14:07,381 --> 02:14:10,100
We've made necessary arrangements
to get Rajesh & Ramesh out on bail.

1189
02:14:12,987 --> 02:14:16,445
This boat we're travelling in, won't take
much longer to reach the Sri Lankan shore.

1190
02:14:17,658 --> 02:14:20,525
Simon and family must be
travelling there in another boat.

1191
02:14:25,032 --> 02:14:26,579
To our dream.

1192
02:14:28,069 --> 02:14:30,287
To our freedom.

1193
02:14:30,287 --> 02:14:40,270
