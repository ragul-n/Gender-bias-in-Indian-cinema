The moon will illuminate

The stars will make destiny
shine brighter.

10
00:02:17,203 --> 00:02:21,230
It's all a game. It's
a spicy snack.

11
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:26,108
After squabble, an
amiable solution.

12
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:30,173
Buy a ticket and watch the show.

13
00:02:30,216 --> 00:02:34,152

Fool, don't get married
and come.

19
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:59,236
If you married a foreigner, then
our image will tarnish.

20
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:23,193
Watch the show.

21
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:27,195
The path of love is difficult
and arduous.

22
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:31,233
There are many setbacks.

23
00:03:31,277 --> 00:03:35,270
Find a foreigner and have fun.

24
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:40,076
Let events unfold as destined.

25
00:03:40,119 --> 00:03:44,146
Buy a ticket and watch the show.

26
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:48,092

When will the gate open?

33
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:20,090
We have to wait for another
train to pass by.

34
00:04:36,175 --> 00:04:39,110
Mirror image. He is physician
Tarachand.

35
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:45,242
Come. Sit. -Thanks.

36
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,251
It has opened. Come on.

37
00:04:59,265 --> 00:05:02,132
People say that within 15 days
physician Tarachand..

38
00:05:02,201 --> 00:05:04,999
..can cure all kinds
of ailments.

39
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:08,038
Let me tell you something.
They are right.

40
00:05:08,207 --> 00:05:10,266
But I need 15 days.

41
00:05:11,277 --> 00:05:16,112
I swear on Baba and say that l
could have cured Nikhil in a jiffy.

42
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:18,046
No, not that.

43
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:21,120
Not after marriage. He had
a problem before marriage.

44
00:05:21,287 --> 00:05:24,051
Nikhil and Aamna
love each other.

45
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:25,250
The boy is Hindu. The
girl is Muslim.

46
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:28,050
So their families are
bound to oppose.

47
00:05:28,127 --> 00:05:31,028
So I played a drama with Nikki.

48
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:34,131
But just then my brother-in-law
passed away.

49
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:36,227
You don't understand what
brother-in-law means?

50
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:40,301
I don't know what it is called
in English. They are relatives.

51
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:42,232
So I had to come here.

52
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:46,272
And there Purshottam
ruined everything.

53
00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:51,173
I think you're not following me.

54
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:55,111
Let me do one thing. I'll
introduce you to everyone.

55
00:05:56,289 --> 00:05:58,154
This is 'Chole Bature'
(Chickpeas and flatbread).

56
00:05:58,224 --> 00:06:00,055
It gives rise to acidity.

57
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:03,128
And those who suffer from
acidity problem eat it.

58
00:06:03,262 --> 00:06:07,164
This hand belongs to Purshottam.

59
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:12,128
It's obvious that the person
who is eating is Purshottam.

60
00:06:12,238 --> 00:06:15,230
Yes. Purshottam. He is
ten years elder to me.

61
00:06:16,075 --> 00:06:18,168
But we are more like friends.

62
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:22,046
Purshottam opened an
auto parts shop.

63
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:24,241
And I started the business of
saving people's marriage.

64
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:28,111
Purshottam is a nice man.
Just a bit old fashioned.

65
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:32,055
Today too he firmly believes
in caste system.

66
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:35,218
The wounds of Partition
have still not healed.

67
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,120
Enough.

68
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:42,201
Have patience. Let
them come. Look.

69
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:48,198
She is Purshottam's mother.
Everybody calls her mother.

70
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:51,134
Everybody in Lajpat
locality fears her.

71
00:06:54,213 --> 00:06:57,114
They have still not come.
-They'll come.

72
00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:00,051
And she is the wife.
Purshottam's wife.

73
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:04,212
She is a bit emotional. And
she likes to dye her hair.

74
00:07:05,057 --> 00:07:07,082
You know me, don't you?

75
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:10,027
Don't eat it, Son. You'll
suffer from indigestion.

76
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:12,222
Enough. Enough.

77
00:07:16,068 --> 00:07:19,231
He is Nikhil. Purshottam
and his wife's only son.

78
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:24,132
He is a gem. He returned
from aboard yesterday.

79
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:27,111
And already his marriage
is being discussed.

80
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,238
We've brought him here without
his knowledge..

81
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:30,208
..to see a prospective bride.

82
00:07:33,085 --> 00:07:36,077
Will you just stand like a
statue? Or will you move ahead?

83
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:38,054
Come on. -Okay.

84
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:39,248
He is Chadami.

85
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:43,187
He came along with the
dowry for Purshottam.

86
00:07:44,096 --> 00:07:46,087
Seeing his face you must
have understood..

87
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:48,191
..that accepting dowry
is not good.

88
00:07:49,068 --> 00:07:51,229
A few days ago he met a
foreigner in Connaught Place.

89
00:07:52,104 --> 00:07:56,200
He fell in love. But one day she
left him without saying anything.

90
00:07:56,275 --> 00:07:59,210
Since then he hates everything
American.

91
00:08:00,046 --> 00:08:02,207
And he tries to find a foreigner
to blame for every scam.

92
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,055
This place is not so good.

93
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:13,124
Brother-in-law, there
is still time.

94
00:08:13,192 --> 00:08:15,251
Let's go to the restaurant
on Ghantewale road.

95
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:19,155
Brother-in-law, think about
it. It's your wish.

96
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:22,234
Why have we come here? -Why?

97
00:08:23,102 --> 00:08:24,228
What's wrong in this place?

98
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:28,004
No. Nothing is wrong. But.. -So?

99
00:08:29,108 --> 00:08:30,200
It's okay. But..

100
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:34,076
But. But. But. Don't talk
too much in front of me.

101
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,204
Keep quiet.

102
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:41,278
You've come here to sleep.
Nikhil, wake him up.

103
00:08:44,223 --> 00:08:46,191
They've still not
come. -Physician.

104
00:08:47,093 --> 00:08:48,117
They've come.

105
00:08:49,228 --> 00:08:51,219
Come. Hello. Hello. -Hello.

106
00:08:52,164 --> 00:08:55,031
Purshottam, he is Mr. Mittal.
-Hello.

107
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:57,126
She is his wife. -Hello.
-Hello. -And she..

108
00:08:57,169 --> 00:08:59,034
She is Dolly. -Our daughter.

109
00:09:00,172 --> 00:09:03,039
He is Purshottam. His
mother. -Hello.

110
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:06,078
And his wife. -Hello. -And
he is the boy. Nikhil.

111
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:12,175
Hello. -I'm his brother-in-law.
Chadami.

112
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:14,110
Good afternoon. -Hello.

113
00:09:14,253 --> 00:09:16,118
Dear, touch her feet.

114
00:09:16,188 --> 00:09:17,212
It's okay, Dear.

115
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:21,218
Come. Sit. Come on.
-Come. -Come.

116
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:24,053
Sit here. -You sit here.

117
00:09:24,196 --> 00:09:26,221
You sit here. -Nikhil, sit.

118
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:29,024
You too sit. -You too sit.

119
00:09:44,216 --> 00:09:46,207
Dolly looks so different.

120
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:49,214
Yes. She has lost six kgs.

121
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:52,088
I wake her up at 530
in the morning.

122
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:56,060
She does Yoga exercises seeing
the Baba on the Tv.

123
00:09:56,162 --> 00:09:59,131
Dear, you too must be watching
that show, right?

124
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:02,191
I get up at 9 o'clock.

125
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:08,072
Naughty boy. -Dear, what's your
educational qualification?

126
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:10,108
I've done a course in
fashion designing.

127
00:10:10,142 --> 00:10:11,234
Laktakia aunt's college.

128
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:14,079
Wow! Great.

129
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,239
My father-in-law used
to say that..

130
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:21,110
..you shouldn't match the girl
and the boy's horoscope.

131
00:10:22,154 --> 00:10:24,122
You should match the girl and
her mother-in-law's horoscope.

132
00:10:24,156 --> 00:10:25,248
Still look at this. It has been
made on computer. -No.

133
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:28,158
Her brother got it from London.

134
00:10:28,194 --> 00:10:30,059
From London? -Yes.

135
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,188
You should have asked me.

136
00:10:33,099 --> 00:10:36,068
We won't fix it without taking
your opinion. Keep quite.

137
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:39,037
I say let the girl and
the boy sit together.

138
00:10:39,105 --> 00:10:40,265
They both should look
good. That's it.

139
00:10:41,107 --> 00:10:42,131
Chadami, come here.

140
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:44,073
Nikhil, go. -This horoscope
is from London. -Go.

141
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:45,236
Go, Dear. Don't feel shy. -Go.

142
00:10:46,178 --> 00:10:49,045
The horoscope is matching.
-Yes, absolutely.

143
00:10:51,217 --> 00:10:54,084
Don't they look good together?
-They look okay.

144
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:58,123
The girl is a bit healthy.
Isn't she?

145
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:01,218
Till the marriage she'll
lose five kgs more.

146
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:04,120
Dolly is very hard-working.

147
00:11:04,196 --> 00:11:07,063
very beautiful. -Yes.

148
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,157
Uncle, try to understand.

149
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:13,038
I understood. -What
did you understand?

150
00:11:13,105 --> 00:11:16,040
Let these young people
talk alone.

151
00:11:16,108 --> 00:11:19,134
We are old people. We
might die anytime.

152
00:11:19,211 --> 00:11:22,146
They have to live together.
Let them talk alone.

153
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:26,150
I don't have any objection.
We too are modern. Right?

154
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:33,251
When Mr. Mittal has no
objection, then let's go out.

155
00:11:34,093 --> 00:11:36,118
Come on. I too have
to go to my clinic.

156
00:11:37,063 --> 00:11:40,260
Your uncle? -I have no relation
with my uncle.

157
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:44,235
Don't hesitate. Ask
whatever you want.

158
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:49,064
It means lowering your status.

159
00:11:49,141 --> 00:11:52,110
If he had married a foreigner..

160
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:55,045
..then at least his status
would have improved.

161
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:10,061
Do you always wear
so much make-up?

162
00:12:11,163 --> 00:12:14,257
No. I have to do
it occasionally.

163
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:19,103
By the way, you too should
go to a salon.

164
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:23,234
You have many blackheads
on your nose.

165
00:12:31,183 --> 00:12:34,084
Is your name at home Dolly?

166
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:38,182
No. My home's name
is Mittal Palace.

167
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:45,063
We are three sisters.

168
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:49,032
My papa is very happy.
He loves girls.

169
00:12:52,238 --> 00:12:55,071
And what do you like?

170
00:12:56,242 --> 00:12:59,040
Yoga. Interior designing.

171
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:01,236
And Tv. I really like Tv.

172
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:07,041
You don't watch movies? -No.

173
00:13:07,219 --> 00:13:09,084
We are Baba's followers.

174
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:13,181
Nowadays vulgarity is
shown in movies.

175
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:17,092
You see, we don't
like such films.

176
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:22,100
I too don't like it. I always
drop the popcorn.

177
00:13:26,105 --> 00:13:27,094
Joke.

178
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:29,207
You have a good sense of humour.

179
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:39,240
Actually I've even made
the time-table.

180
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:43,212
Is that so? -After marriage
every week..

181
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:46,158
..we'll have two to
three outings.

182
00:13:47,092 --> 00:13:50,084
Yes. You go on Saturday.
I'll go on Sunday.

183
00:13:53,098 --> 00:13:55,066
Joke. You too.

184
00:13:58,237 --> 00:14:00,034
Dolly. -Yes.

185
00:14:01,073 --> 00:14:02,165
Do you have a boyfriend?

186
00:14:03,142 --> 00:14:04,131
No.

187
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:06,202
I too don't have any.

188
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,017
Mister. -Yes.

189
00:14:16,088 --> 00:14:18,215
How are you? -Fine.
-Add more spices.

190
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:22,056
Add more spices. Cook
it deliciously.

191
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:25,063
Sukha leads a wonderful
life. -ls that so?

192
00:14:25,097 --> 00:14:27,156
He changes his girlfriend
everyday. -ls that so?

193
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:30,997
That model..Meena Das. -Yes.

194
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:33,035
She came yesterday.

195
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:36,141
They both were locked in the
room for three hours.

196
00:14:37,076 --> 00:14:41,069
Sir, she is younger than
the rest of the girls.

197
00:14:41,146 --> 00:14:43,171
After all it's Sukha.
-ls that so?

198
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:47,151
Physician.. physician
is his family friend.

199
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:50,112
On every function he comes
here to give him a card.

200
00:14:50,155 --> 00:14:52,055
He surely comes.

201
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:55,060
Sukha changes his girlfriend
everyday. -Yes.

202
00:14:55,127 --> 00:14:57,118
He is Sukha. Won't he change?

203
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:00,122
Where are you going?

204
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:02,167
I'm going home to
change my pants.

205
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:05,101
For the past three days I've
been wearing the same pants.

206
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:08,035
He felt offended.

207
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:11,167
Go. -Go. You can only
change pants.

208
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,048
Don't feel dejected.

209
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:20,185
It's futile. Just relax.

210
00:15:21,053 --> 00:15:23,214
Even being positive won't
make any difference.

211
00:15:28,127 --> 00:15:30,027
What's wrong with your watch?

212
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:36,092
Same problem. It always
shows 630.

213
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:41,139
Laugh as much as you
want. -Don't worry.

214
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:44,037
If God wills then everything
will be fine.

215
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:46,168
When?

216
00:15:47,246 --> 00:15:50,272
You don't understand.
My image is at stake.

217
00:15:51,216 --> 00:15:54,083
I'm fed up of my problem.

218
00:15:55,187 --> 00:15:57,087
Solve my problem.

219
00:15:57,222 --> 00:16:01,158
It's a 15 days course. After
that you won't get any rest.

220
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:04,186
What are you saying? -l
give the guarantee.

221
00:16:04,229 --> 00:16:05,218
Hurry up.

222
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:09,032
When is your America's
tour scheduled for?

223
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:13,195
Its Goddess's grace. I'll
go on a tour the day..

224
00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:16,141
..I get the damsels. -Damsels?

225
00:16:17,042 --> 00:16:20,068
Damsels. Girls. -Oh.

226
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:26,050
Uncle, for any illegal
immigration..

227
00:16:26,118 --> 00:16:28,052
..for extension of visa..

228
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:31,214
..and for commercial visit.

229
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:33,249
Commercial visit?

230
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:38,221
Uncle, let me know if
you need anything.

231
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:43,100
Be it of any country. I have
all kinds of damsels.

232
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:47,138
Here. Have it twice
a day with milk.

233
00:16:47,272 --> 00:16:49,137
I'm leaving. -Okay.

234
00:16:51,143 --> 00:16:52,132
Next.

235
00:16:53,145 --> 00:16:54,271
But.. -Again the same thing.

236
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,275
Trust me. -I trust you.

237
00:17:01,286 --> 00:17:03,049
Next.

238
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:11,061
Twice with milk.

239
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:24,109
Uncle, thanks for the medicine.

240
00:17:26,278 --> 00:17:29,076
Look who is here! -Lets
go and meet him.

241
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:34,244
You are superb. -Your
songs are superb.

242
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:38,120
Medicine. -Medicine.

243
00:17:39,258 --> 00:17:41,158
Quiet. Take out the car.

244
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:46,223
Fools. They want the medicine.

245
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:51,069
Chadami, bring it. Give sweets.

246
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:54,139
Hello, Mother. -God bless you.

247
00:17:54,173 --> 00:17:57,006
What date has been
fixed? -What date?

248
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,045
What did they both talk about?

249
00:18:00,145 --> 00:18:03,171
I don't know. But Mr. Mittal
had called.

250
00:18:03,215 --> 00:18:06,150
Dolly was crying. She said
that Nikhil insulted her.

251
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:09,220
Is that so? Maybe he didn't
like the girl.

252
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:13,190
He should tell us what
kind of girl he likes.

253
00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:16,254
I think the matter is something
else. -What do you mean?

254
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:20,189
Look at this. You should
explain to us.

255
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:24,035
You know such obscene
things better.

256
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:26,203
The boys of this generation
are different.

257
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,007
And he has come from aboard.

258
00:18:29,174 --> 00:18:32,268
They have strange fashion and
strange mannerism there.

259
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:36,206
I hope he has no such vice.

260
00:18:37,249 --> 00:18:40,116
Do you know? Yesterday
an English..

261
00:18:40,152 --> 00:18:42,086
..movie was shown on the cable.

262
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:44,055
Broken mountain or something
like that.

263
00:18:45,257 --> 00:18:47,248
Do you know what was in the
film? -I understood.

264
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:50,057
Two boys.. -I understood.

265
00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:54,063
Where is Purshottam? -On
the terrace. Where else?

266
00:18:54,199 --> 00:18:56,133
If you are going there,
then take this too.

267
00:18:56,201 --> 00:18:58,066
Where is Purshottam?

268
00:18:59,204 --> 00:19:03,106
Since morning his mother has
shown him ten photos.

269
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:06,101
But he is not ready
to meet the girl.

270
00:19:06,211 --> 00:19:09,180
Will you break ice
all your life?

271
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:15,177
Look, Nikhil talks
to you freely.

272
00:19:16,221 --> 00:19:18,155
Find out what is the matter.

273
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:34,000
He is 'Waheguru Autoparts' owner
Purshottam's son. -Yes.

274
00:19:34,273 --> 00:19:38,107
Did he get married? -Shanichar's
buffalo is not well.

275
00:19:43,248 --> 00:19:46,149
Come, Nikhil. Come. Sit.

276
00:19:50,122 --> 00:19:52,249
What will you have?
Tea or cold drink?

277
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:56,060
Or potato snack? -No.
Nothing. Thank you.

278
00:20:00,165 --> 00:20:01,189
Look, Nikhil.

279
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:04,235
Today consider me as your friend
and not your uncle.

280
00:20:05,103 --> 00:20:07,230
Purshottam was saying you don't
want to get married.

281
00:20:08,106 --> 00:20:10,131
I want to know the reason.

282
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:14,236
Actually Uncle, papa doesn't
understand me.

283
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:16,247
There is a generation
gap between us.

284
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:19,209
Since childhood our relationship
has been such.

285
00:20:19,284 --> 00:20:22,117
As a kid whenever I made
a mistake.. -Sorry.

286
00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:23,212
What were you saying?

287
00:20:24,189 --> 00:20:26,157
As a kid whenever I made a
mistake.. -I'm here to rectify..

288
00:20:26,191 --> 00:20:28,159
..the mistakes made
in childhood.

289
00:20:28,193 --> 00:20:30,161
It's our family business.

290
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:33,198
I've solved grave problems.
Your problem is small.

291
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:37,228
Uncle, the matter
is very serious.

292
00:20:39,137 --> 00:20:43,130
Actually I love a girl
in America. -What?

293
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:45,201
And she is a Muslim girl.

294
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:50,272
Joke. You're joking with me.

295
00:20:51,116 --> 00:20:53,175
You joke with me. -No.

296
00:20:57,089 --> 00:21:00,183
Are you mad? Do you know
what you're saying?

297
00:21:01,126 --> 00:21:04,027
You shouldn't even look at the
path which is forbidden.

298
00:21:04,229 --> 00:21:07,130
Look, it has already happened.
Now forget about it. -Forget it?

299
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:11,033
Yes. American love is not long
-lasting. Partners keep changing.

300
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:13,196
How do you know? -Don't
I see it in movies?

301
00:21:14,072 --> 00:21:16,040
Uncle, Aamna does
live in America.

302
00:21:16,141 --> 00:21:18,132
But she is more lndian
than you and me.

303
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:20,237
What's the use of
explaining to me?

304
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,144
Who will explain to Purshottam?

305
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,272
Forget her. That's it.

306
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:28,211
Anyway. I thought you'll
have a solution.

307
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,255
But I think I'll have
to find the solution.

308
00:21:31,256 --> 00:21:34,248
Wait! Solution. Sit.

309
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:44,135
If you have decided, then I'll
have to think of something.

310
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:49,096
Nobody ever left my
clinic untreated.

311
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:51,072
I'll help you too.

312
00:21:53,178 --> 00:21:55,112
I'll have to think of something.

313
00:21:56,181 --> 00:21:58,172
'l don't have any relation
with my uncle.'

314
00:21:58,216 --> 00:22:01,276
'His son did an inter-caste
marriage in England.'

315
00:22:02,054 --> 00:22:04,215
'lf he had married a foreigner..

316
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:06,087
..then at least his status
would have improved.'

317
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:07,182
'You are right.'

318
00:22:08,093 --> 00:22:10,220
Do you know any foreigner
who can act?

319
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:13,256
Maybe. But why?

320
00:22:14,199 --> 00:22:17,134
Did you watch Shahrukh Khan's
film 'Hum Aapke Hain Kaun'.

321
00:22:17,202 --> 00:22:19,067
You mean DDLJ.

322
00:22:19,104 --> 00:22:24,041
In that film the girl's alliance
is fixed with another boy.

323
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:25,235
But the hero comes to
live in their house.

324
00:22:26,044 --> 00:22:28,069
And he wins the family's heart.

325
00:22:29,114 --> 00:22:33,244
So? -Look, if we told Purshottam
that you love a Muslim girl..

326
00:22:33,285 --> 00:22:35,185
..then he will kill both of us.

327
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:38,156
But if we say that the
girl is American..

328
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:41,023
..then I might convince him.

329
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:44,194
Then? -What else?

330
00:22:44,262 --> 00:22:46,127
Along with the American girl,
we'll call her too.

331
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:47,256
What's her name? -Aamna.

332
00:22:48,066 --> 00:22:51,058
Yes. We'll call her too.
And within 15 days..

333
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:52,262
..she'll have to win
your family's heart.

334
00:22:53,071 --> 00:22:55,232
She will have to prove
that she is an lndian.

335
00:22:56,074 --> 00:22:57,234
She is bound to be better
than the American girl.

336
00:22:58,076 --> 00:23:00,237
After she wins the family's
heart, we'll reveal the truth.

337
00:23:05,183 --> 00:23:07,242
You think this will work?

338
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:11,079
I don't know that. But I give the
guarantee that we'll lose nothing.

339
00:23:11,256 --> 00:23:13,190
Don't worry. Leave it on me.

340
00:23:13,258 --> 00:23:16,227
Just arrange for a foreigner
who is interested in drama.

341
00:23:23,101 --> 00:23:25,126
A foreigner who is interested
in drama.

342
00:23:27,205 --> 00:23:30,197
I'm interested in drama.
-Okay. Later.

343
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:34,235
I knew the problem. I started
the treatment too.

344
00:23:35,147 --> 00:23:38,207
Nikhil told his family
that he is in love..

345
00:23:38,283 --> 00:23:41,116
..with his fellow student
in America.

346
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:44,112
The outcome was exactly
as expected.

347
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:48,282
So you have decided
to get married.

348
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:53,087
Let me tell you, you can bring
a foreigner in this house..

349
00:23:53,165 --> 00:23:54,132
..only over my dead body.

350
00:23:54,199 --> 00:23:56,099
Oh God! Now the daughter-in-law
of this house..

351
00:23:56,134 --> 00:23:58,068
..will roam around half-naked.

352
00:23:58,236 --> 00:24:01,262
Am I alive to see this day?

353
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:04,165
Brother-in-law, I suspect
foreign hand in this.

354
00:24:04,242 --> 00:24:08,042
Foreign hand was the one
that slapped you.

355
00:24:08,213 --> 00:24:10,078
We are now talking about a girl.

356
00:24:10,148 --> 00:24:12,207
Let me tell you, you can bring
a foreigner in this house..

357
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:13,274
..only over my dead body.

358
00:24:14,252 --> 00:24:16,220
If that's your final decision,
then I will disinherit you.

359
00:24:20,091 --> 00:24:21,115
Brother-in-law, the
shop's on lease..

360
00:24:21,193 --> 00:24:23,184
..and the house is on sister's
name. -Quiet.

361
00:24:23,261 --> 00:24:24,250
Let me tell you.. -The
foreigner will come..

362
00:24:25,063 --> 00:24:28,157
Only on your dead
body. I heard it.

363
00:24:29,067 --> 00:24:31,262
Be quiet for a minute.
Let me think.

364
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:34,070
Over my dead body.. -Nikhil.

365
00:24:34,206 --> 00:24:37,073
Ask him. Ask your useless uncle.

366
00:24:37,209 --> 00:24:39,268
He met a foreigner at
Connaught Place.

367
00:24:40,078 --> 00:24:42,046
He said I have fallen
in love. Love.

368
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:45,047
But she left him. Didn't
give him a second look.

369
00:24:45,183 --> 00:24:47,174
She didn't even call him back.
Why don't you tell him?

370
00:24:48,253 --> 00:24:52,246
Look son. Foreigners are frauds
It's their nature.

371
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:54,182
Suresh's daughter-in-law.

372
00:24:54,292 --> 00:24:57,193
Everyone would say she's so
fair. She seems like a foreigner.

373
00:24:57,295 --> 00:24:59,160
She eloped with a taxi driver.

374
00:24:59,197 --> 00:25:01,028
And you are thinking about
marrying a foreigner.

375
00:25:01,199 --> 00:25:03,190
Let me tell you, only
over my dead body..

376
00:25:03,235 --> 00:25:06,227
The daughter-in-law has still not
arrived. But you can die right now.

377
00:25:10,075 --> 00:25:12,066
Did I send you to
America for this?

378
00:25:13,078 --> 00:25:14,102
Brother-in-law, he's
a young boy.

379
00:25:14,145 --> 00:25:15,203
Be careful of what
you say to him.

380
00:25:16,147 --> 00:25:18,115
If he's young, he can
join the army.

381
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:21,209
In this house, you will
have to do as I say.

382
00:25:23,154 --> 00:25:25,179
I will only marry that girl.

383
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:30,127
Now its your decision, should
I get married here..

384
00:25:31,096 --> 00:25:32,063
..or in America?

385
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:45,107
Listen..

386
00:25:49,114 --> 00:25:52,140
Look Situ, stop crying.

387
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:55,276
He's a young boy. He
might do something.

388
00:25:56,288 --> 00:25:59,086
If he wishes to follow his
heart, then let him.

389
00:25:59,124 --> 00:26:00,250
What.. what are you saying?

390
00:26:01,092 --> 00:26:03,060
Quiet, stupid.

391
00:26:04,129 --> 00:26:06,188
Mother, I can approve of it.

392
00:26:06,264 --> 00:26:08,198
But who will talk to
him? -Let me think.

393
00:26:19,177 --> 00:26:20,201
He's here too.

394
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:23,077
That's Mr. Purshottam.

395
00:26:23,181 --> 00:26:25,046
Owner of 'Waheguru Autoparts'.

396
00:26:26,151 --> 00:26:29,086
Yesterday his son was here,
and today it's him.

397
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:32,087
Nainsukh has lost his
other eye too.

398
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:41,258
What's wrong? You seem worried.

399
00:26:44,169 --> 00:26:47,104
You know what Nikhil did?

400
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:49,263
What has he done? He fell
in love with a foreigner.

401
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:53,100
Is it so simple to take a
decision of getting married..

402
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:58,139
How do you know that Nikhil
has fallen in love?

403
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:02,253
How.. how do I know?

404
00:27:03,054 --> 00:27:04,112
That's an odd question.

405
00:27:04,189 --> 00:27:06,214
What else can the children
do when they are there?

406
00:27:07,058 --> 00:27:09,117
So I presumed that he must
have done the same.

407
00:27:09,194 --> 00:27:12,220
I sent him to America
so that he..

408
00:27:16,167 --> 00:27:20,126
I just.. -Purshottam calm
down, calm down.

409
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:27,111
Take my advice, considering
the current scenario..

410
00:27:27,178 --> 00:27:28,145
..this is good news.

411
00:27:28,213 --> 00:27:32,240
My son has selected a bride
for himself, from America.

412
00:27:33,118 --> 00:27:35,211
And I should consider
it good news. -Yes.

413
00:27:36,187 --> 00:27:39,054
He could have found himself
a groom in America.

414
00:27:41,092 --> 00:27:43,083
Look. He's a young boy.

415
00:27:43,261 --> 00:27:45,126
What if he leaves home?

416
00:27:45,196 --> 00:27:47,130
Or marries that foreigner
and settles down there?

417
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:49,133
What can you or I do then?

418
00:27:51,236 --> 00:27:53,227
Take my advice, and call
that girl here..

419
00:27:54,072 --> 00:27:55,198
..and get them married.

420
00:27:56,141 --> 00:27:59,167
At least, we will get to
be a part of everything.

421
00:28:00,045 --> 00:28:02,206
And think, if you've a foreigner
as a daughter-in-law..

422
00:28:03,081 --> 00:28:05,140
..you will be more respected.

423
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:08,117
Your house will turn
into a foreign land.

424
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,246
A small developed country..

425
00:28:11,056 --> 00:28:12,182
..amongst the developing
countries

426
00:28:12,257 --> 00:28:16,216
B-1 1 7, Lajpat Nagar. Opposite
Lal Chand Snacks.

427
00:28:22,133 --> 00:28:23,225
Open. -Yes.

428
00:28:29,174 --> 00:28:32,234
Send Nikhil. What? -Send Nikhil.

429
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:36,042
Nikhil.

430
00:28:37,148 --> 00:28:44,054
We have decided if you wish
to marry that foreigner.

431
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:48,023
Then it's your wish.

432
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:52,188
You can call her here
and get married.

433
00:28:58,303 --> 00:29:01,136
Brother-in-law, what
are you saying?

434
00:29:07,212 --> 00:29:11,148
As soon as she comes here, we
will get you two married.

435
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:13,217
What's the hurry?

436
00:29:14,052 --> 00:29:15,246
I mean, you can spend
some time with her.

437
00:29:16,121 --> 00:29:18,180
After all, you should like
the girl as well.

438
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:22,192
Yes. We should like
the girl as well.

439
00:29:23,061 --> 00:29:26,189
When the elders have
selected her.

440
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:30,200
Then why should we give
our acceptance.

441
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:34,230
But still I want all of you to
spend some time with her..

442
00:29:35,073 --> 00:29:37,041
..get to know her, then
we can get married.

443
00:29:38,143 --> 00:29:40,168
Today we are doing as he wants.

444
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:43,042
But still he's trying
to delay the matter.

445
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:47,084
What does he want?

446
00:29:50,188 --> 00:29:52,179
Physician, tell me how should
I take the medicines.

447
00:29:52,223 --> 00:29:54,191
Three times a week.

448
00:29:54,259 --> 00:29:56,227
And eat only as much as you can.

449
00:29:56,261 --> 00:29:59,059
Don't try to over do it.

450
00:30:00,064 --> 00:30:02,123
So, Purshottam gave
his acceptance.

451
00:30:02,167 --> 00:30:04,135
But still Nikhil asked
for a few days.

452
00:30:04,202 --> 00:30:09,071
Purshottam couldn't understand
what was going on.

453
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,174
Purshottam didn't know.

454
00:30:11,242 --> 00:30:14,075
It does take time to
find a foreigner.

455
00:30:23,087 --> 00:30:24,213
Where have you brought me?

456
00:30:24,289 --> 00:30:26,120
Where can we find
a foreigner here?

457
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:28,182
At least I didn't take you to
Paharganj, like you did.

458
00:30:28,226 --> 00:30:30,194
I have always seen foreigners
since childhood in that place.

459
00:30:30,261 --> 00:30:32,229
Uncle, please let it be.

460
00:30:33,064 --> 00:30:35,225
And please don't interfere
during the auditions. Please.

461
00:30:37,068 --> 00:30:38,194
I love, Nikhil.

462
00:30:40,071 --> 00:30:42,164
Uncle, I meant foreigners.
Not lndian.

463
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,107
Have patience. -I love, Nikhil.

464
00:30:47,245 --> 00:30:49,076
I love you, Nikhil.

465
00:30:49,113 --> 00:30:50,239
Yeah, yeah he's your
husband. -Sorry..

466
00:30:50,281 --> 00:30:52,078
..I am sorry. -Okay,
we will call you.

467
00:30:52,116 --> 00:30:54,243
Okay, bye. -Uncle, she
doesn't know English.

468
00:30:54,285 --> 00:30:57,049
I don't either. -Oh God. -Hide.

469
00:30:57,088 --> 00:31:00,148
I love, Nikhil. -Yes.
-Okay, I get it.

470
00:31:00,225 --> 00:31:02,216
I love, Nikhil.

471
00:31:03,061 --> 00:31:04,050
What?

472
00:31:04,295 --> 00:31:06,160
She's good. Shall we choose her?

473
00:31:06,164 --> 00:31:08,132
She'll care more for
the dog than you.

474
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:12,260
I love, Nikhil. And I know
a bit of Bharat Natyam.

475
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:18,107
What's this, two?
-I love, Nikhil.

476
00:31:18,176 --> 00:31:20,076
One free with another.
-No please, uncle.

477
00:31:20,111 --> 00:31:21,100
I..Iove

478
00:31:24,115 --> 00:31:26,242
..Nikhil. I do.

479
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:30,187
What attitude.

480
00:31:30,255 --> 00:31:34,021
I love, Nikhil. -Doesn't it seem
a bit like motherly love?

481
00:31:34,092 --> 00:31:35,218
It's just like our Hindi movies.

482
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:38,161
Meet the mother before the
actress. -What is he looking for?

483
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:41,164
Your daughters. -I don't
have any daughter.

484
00:31:42,267 --> 00:31:45,236
These are the girls. -I never
said they are boys.

485
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:47,101
But look at their age.

486
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:50,139
You want to introduce one of
them as your future bride.

487
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:55,204
We should have gone to Paharganj.
That would have been better.

488
00:31:57,215 --> 00:31:59,080
Uncle, this plan was a flop.

489
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:07,216
Nikhil. Start the car.

490
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:10,151
I won't go to Paharganj.
-Fine, let's go.

491
00:32:17,068 --> 00:32:20,128
Raju, reduce the level.
-Come, Nikhil. Come.

492
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:23,164
Hello, uncle. Hello.

493
00:32:24,142 --> 00:32:25,131
Manicure.

494
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:29,075
Metro sexual. -What sexual?

495
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:32,272
Take a seat. -Take a seat.

496
00:32:35,186 --> 00:32:39,020
Uncle, would you like to have
something? -No, nothing at all.

497
00:32:39,257 --> 00:32:41,248
Mr. Sukha, he's my
nephew Nikhil.

498
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:45,093
You want me to make his
video. I will do it.

499
00:32:45,263 --> 00:32:48,255
Nikhil, uncle is our
family friend.

500
00:32:49,233 --> 00:32:51,133
We never actually need
him for anything.

501
00:32:51,202 --> 00:32:53,102
No. Never at all.

502
00:32:54,238 --> 00:32:57,207
Anyway, this way he got you
along. I got to meet you.

503
00:32:58,142 --> 00:33:01,043
Nikhil, where did you
learn to dance?

504
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:05,081
Dance.. -You haven't
learnt. It's okay.

505
00:33:05,216 --> 00:33:08,185
We'll make him sit on a bike.
-Sukha, that's not the matter.

506
00:33:08,219 --> 00:33:10,119
There's something else.

507
00:33:11,189 --> 00:33:12,247
You want to send him to America.

508
00:33:13,057 --> 00:33:15,048
He has just returned
from America.

509
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:20,253
Then? -Actually, we wanted a
foreigner for a few days.

510
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:25,101
Uncle, you always keep the
special dose for yourself.

511
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:27,194
See Nikhil. He never
thinks about us.

512
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:35,111
Sukha, actually we want
a foreigner for acting.

513
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:39,046
Let me tell you everything.

514
00:33:53,064 --> 00:33:56,261
But a foreigner for acting..

515
00:33:58,169 --> 00:34:00,034
That's difficult.

516
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:06,040
Just a minute. Titu.

517
00:34:09,113 --> 00:34:11,206
Uncle, there's an American.

518
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:15,076
Who, Titu? -No, she's a lady.

519
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:17,112
Her papers are with me.

520
00:34:17,188 --> 00:34:20,089
And I have heard, she
can act as well.

521
00:34:22,126 --> 00:34:24,094
There's a small problem, Nikhil.

522
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:26,253
She's not the type you
described to me.

523
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:28,157
She's very simple.

524
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:32,036
She's a grown up, but
her name is Nicky.

525
00:34:33,104 --> 00:34:36,198
Nikhil, she's staying here
for lndian citizenship.

526
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,174
And she'll soon receive
her passport as well.

527
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:40,107
The whole matter is in my hands.

528
00:34:40,178 --> 00:34:43,272
I suggest, go and interview her.

529
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,212
You smoke. -No.

530
00:34:52,156 --> 00:34:53,248
You drink. -No.

531
00:34:54,225 --> 00:34:56,159
She'll have to change
her habits.

532
00:34:58,129 --> 00:35:02,065
Parents names. -Mr. John
Abert, Mrs. Andry Abert.

533
00:35:03,134 --> 00:35:04,158
Do you have any siblings?

534
00:35:04,202 --> 00:35:07,000
I am asking for any brothers
or sisters. -Yes, I know.

535
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:08,163
Only one brother?

536
00:35:09,173 --> 00:35:11,232
Where does your mother
stay? -America.

537
00:35:12,176 --> 00:35:15,077
And where does your father stay?
I am asking about her father.

538
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:16,205
What kind of a question is that?

539
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,077
America, obviously.

540
00:35:18,149 --> 00:35:21,141
Why? No divorce. -Divorce. Why?

541
00:35:21,219 --> 00:35:24,188
No. America, marriage. Soon
they get divorced.

542
00:35:25,189 --> 00:35:27,020
Look, I don't know what
he's talking about.

543
00:35:27,058 --> 00:35:28,184
I come from a happy family.

544
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:31,061
She'll have to change
her family.

545
00:35:31,195 --> 00:35:34,028
Do you..always wear these
kind of clothes?

546
00:35:35,266 --> 00:35:38,099
Yes. -She'll need to
change her clothes.

547
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:42,162
What do you think of lndia?
-I love lndia.

548
00:35:43,174 --> 00:35:45,142
We'll have to change the girl.

549
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:01,217
Something like this,
you know. -Yes.

550
00:36:02,126 --> 00:36:04,094
I'm trying to explain her.

551
00:36:05,129 --> 00:36:06,221
It's so short.

552
00:36:30,288 --> 00:36:32,188
This is so much.

553
00:36:35,126 --> 00:36:39,153
Do you understand? The impression
should be of a bad girl..

554
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:42,064
What do you call a wretched
girl? -Why don't you show me?

555
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:43,123
Naughty.

556
00:36:54,278 --> 00:36:56,041
Not this.

557
00:36:57,248 --> 00:37:00,183
Hey, l.. -You say.
No, you say it.

558
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:10,126
It seems a bit cute.

559
00:37:30,114 --> 00:37:31,138
Are you okay?

560
00:38:07,218 --> 00:38:10,085
So, Nikki had made
her arrangements.

561
00:38:10,187 --> 00:38:13,020
It was time now to bring
Nikki and Aamna home.

562
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:16,093
So l, Nikhil and Chadami
came to the airport.

563
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:19,254
We went ahead, leaving Chadami
behind to park the car.

564
00:38:22,099 --> 00:38:24,158
150. -But you said 100.

565
00:38:24,268 --> 00:38:26,236
There was a traffic
jam on the road.

566
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:29,072
That I don't know.

567
00:38:29,173 --> 00:38:31,232
Do you want to take the
auto to Germany?

568
00:38:37,214 --> 00:38:41,150
Why hasn't she arrived? -I never
talked to a foreigner before?

569
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:44,018
Now you have a foreigner
as your daughter-in-law.

570
00:38:44,088 --> 00:38:45,146
You can talk to her everyday.

571
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:48,215
She will speak in English.

572
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:51,057
That's right.

573
00:38:58,102 --> 00:39:00,229
There comes your
daughter-in-law. She wears vests.

574
00:39:04,075 --> 00:39:06,043
Father, Uncle. She's Nikki.

575
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:08,269
Nikki, he's my father.
And my uncle.

576
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:25,189
So, shall we go? -No. You
mentioned your friend.

577
00:39:25,262 --> 00:39:29,062
Friend. Oh, she's coming.
-She's coming.

578
00:39:29,133 --> 00:39:31,192
She's talking about her friend.

579
00:39:34,105 --> 00:39:36,005
She came wearing a vest.

580
00:39:36,173 --> 00:39:39,074
Her friend must be wearing
pants. I am sure.

581
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:56,185
She's here. My friend, Aamna.

582
00:39:58,262 --> 00:40:01,129
This is my father, and
that's my uncle.

583
00:40:01,265 --> 00:40:03,028
Aamna.

584
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:09,239
She's a Muslim.

585
00:40:10,107 --> 00:40:11,233
And she'll stay at our home.

586
00:40:12,109 --> 00:40:16,068
This boy has ruined everything.

587
00:40:16,213 --> 00:40:19,239
Till date, I maintained my
distance from Muslims.

588
00:40:20,284 --> 00:40:23,219
As soon as we reach home I'll
ask him to take her to a hotel.

589
00:40:23,287 --> 00:40:25,050
Yes, of course.

590
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:29,088
Brother-in-law, the Americans
are not good people.

591
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:32,129
Watch. Take my advice, and
ask her to go back.

592
00:40:32,229 --> 00:40:34,254
Take the luggage. -Okay.

593
00:40:36,233 --> 00:40:41,068
Hello. Have you come
from America? -Yes.

594
00:40:43,073 --> 00:40:44,199
Nikki. Didn't Nikki come?

595
00:40:45,075 --> 00:40:47,134
Who's that standing there? -Who?

596
00:40:47,211 --> 00:40:50,078
Take the luggage. -But,
brother-in-law..

597
00:40:51,248 --> 00:40:53,113
She just came from outside.

598
00:40:53,184 --> 00:40:55,152
America is outside the
country as well.

599
00:40:55,252 --> 00:41:01,122
No, physician, she came here
in a rickshaw. -Cannabis.

600
00:41:01,258 --> 00:41:06,127
If you ever drink cannabis
again, then I will..

601
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:10,191
Nikhil, ask everyone to
sit in the car. -Yes.

602
00:41:11,101 --> 00:41:14,036
There's an extra person.

603
00:41:14,171 --> 00:41:15,263
Who'll take the bus home?

604
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:35,158
Situ, doesn't that look
like our car? -Yes.

605
00:41:35,226 --> 00:41:37,160
They have arrived. Start.

606
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:45,158
Come. -Mother, which
is Rati Ram's house?

607
00:41:45,236 --> 00:41:47,227
What? -Rati Ram

608
00:41:48,105 --> 00:41:50,130
Rati Ram's dead. Go.

609
00:41:52,276 --> 00:41:53,265
Shall we leave as well?

610
00:41:54,078 --> 00:41:55,204
We have to attend another
wedding procession.

611
00:41:56,313 --> 00:42:00,113
The flight is coming from
America and not Karol Baug.

612
00:42:00,217 --> 00:42:03,118
It takes time. Don't
anyone move.

613
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:04,279
I'll break your legs.

614
00:42:25,109 --> 00:42:27,168
They are here. Start.

615
00:42:32,182 --> 00:42:34,116
What's wrong? Why did you stop?

616
00:42:34,184 --> 00:42:36,084
We'll play an English tune, sir.

617
00:42:36,186 --> 00:42:38,177
One, two, three tequila.

618
00:42:41,292 --> 00:42:43,089
Play Shakira.

619
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:46,287
Mother.

620
00:42:47,164 --> 00:42:49,098
I am from Bhatinda.
I am Happy Singh.

621
00:42:49,166 --> 00:42:51,066
I am Tito. -Hi, how
are you doing?

622
00:42:51,101 --> 00:42:53,228
Stop her. She's going inside the
neighbour's house. Here. Here.

623
00:42:57,174 --> 00:43:00,041
Nikki, that's my mom
and my grandmother.

624
00:43:00,110 --> 00:43:02,044
Mom, grandmother that's Nikki.

625
00:43:02,112 --> 00:43:04,046
Hello. -Greetings, dear.

626
00:43:08,052 --> 00:43:09,041
Excuse me.

627
00:43:22,199 --> 00:43:26,158
She has welcomed you as well.

628
00:43:29,173 --> 00:43:32,040
Please everyone, meet
my friend Aamna.

629
00:43:34,244 --> 00:43:35,268
Greetings.

630
00:43:37,047 --> 00:43:39,174
Greetings, dear.
-Congratulations Aunt.

631
00:43:39,249 --> 00:43:41,012
Now you have a foreigner
as your daughter-in-law.

632
00:43:41,085 --> 00:43:43,076
Let's have some celebrations.

633
00:43:43,253 --> 00:43:46,120
Yes. Please everyone,
come inside.

634
00:43:49,159 --> 00:43:50,183
Missed you.

635
00:43:53,163 --> 00:43:54,187
Missed you too.

636
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:58,159
Nikhil, all this..
-Brother-in-law!

637
00:43:58,202 --> 00:43:59,191
You have come.

638
00:44:01,071 --> 00:44:03,130
Nikhil, will everything
be alright?

639
00:44:04,041 --> 00:44:07,135
I'm scared. -You know why we
are doing all this, right?

640
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:12,111
You love me, right?

641
00:44:17,087 --> 00:44:20,056
Then do exactly as I told
you on the phone.

642
00:44:22,059 --> 00:44:25,051
But Nikhil, your family
is so nice.

643
00:44:26,096 --> 00:44:29,190
Everyone's so sweet. Should we
be doing this.. -Just relax.

644
00:44:30,134 --> 00:44:31,158
We aren't doing anything wrong.

645
00:44:31,201 --> 00:44:33,066
We are just changing
their point of view.

646
00:44:33,137 --> 00:44:35,071
We are just changing
their opinion.

647
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,140
Anyway, do you want..

648
00:44:38,208 --> 00:44:41,041
..to join this sweet, happy,
nice family or not?

649
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:44,204
Of course.

650
00:44:45,115 --> 00:44:47,083
Then trust me. -I do.

651
00:44:48,118 --> 00:44:49,142
I have to change.

652
00:44:50,254 --> 00:44:53,223
Really? -Someone might come. Go.

653
00:44:54,158 --> 00:44:55,147
Go.

654
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:01,995
The girl is sweet.

655
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:05,001
But think over it.
She's a Muslim.

656
00:45:05,102 --> 00:45:07,127
She'll stay in our house. Okay?

657
00:45:08,238 --> 00:45:10,069
She looks innocent.

658
00:45:10,107 --> 00:45:13,076
When you have brought an
American then why fear a Muslim?

659
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:15,237
Shut up. I know what
I have to do.

660
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:19,182
Purshottam. I will go right
away and tell the girl..

661
00:45:19,249 --> 00:45:22,275
..okay, you have come for your
friend's happiness sake. So what?

662
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:24,246
We can't tolerate you at all.

663
00:45:24,288 --> 00:45:26,222
Get out of our house right away.

664
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:32,286
Should I go?

665
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:36,199
We will face this day too.

666
00:45:37,034 --> 00:45:39,025
She will stay here.

667
00:45:40,104 --> 00:45:44,131
Look, give them Chadami's
room downstairs.

668
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:46,201
Then where will I go?

669
00:45:47,111 --> 00:45:49,204
It's cool in the veranda
these days.

670
00:45:54,084 --> 00:45:56,075
Son, what are her
parents' names?

671
00:45:57,087 --> 00:45:58,179
My mom is asking your
parents' names.

672
00:45:58,255 --> 00:46:00,155
Oh. Rita and Albert Neddy.

673
00:46:00,257 --> 00:46:04,193
Both will be attending
the wedding, right?

674
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:09,028
Here, have piping hot fritters.

675
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:10,157
Yes, I'll call you
back in a bit.

676
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,259
Let me hear what you are
all talking about.

677
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:15,162
Thank you. -What are
her parents' names?

678
00:46:15,239 --> 00:46:16,263
Now tell her that too.

679
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:19,099
Now my granny wants to know
your parents' names.

680
00:46:20,043 --> 00:46:22,204
Parents' names. -Mom-dad's
names. -Rita and Robert Neddy.

681
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:24,144
Just a minute. Just a minute.

682
00:46:25,149 --> 00:46:28,084
Hadn't you said your father's
name was Albert?

683
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:33,051
Am I right, Brother-in-law?
-Yes.

684
00:46:34,258 --> 00:46:38,024
So Physician, father's name
changes in a minute?

685
00:46:38,228 --> 00:46:41,061
How can father's name
change in a minute?

686
00:46:41,131 --> 00:46:42,257
How can it change, Nikhil?

687
00:46:44,234 --> 00:46:46,225
Yes. That phone call was
of Nikki's mother.

688
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:48,162
She just remarried.

689
00:46:48,272 --> 00:46:50,206
Your mom just called saying
that she remarried.

690
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:53,107
And your father's name changed.
That's why, right? Isn't it?

691
00:46:53,243 --> 00:46:55,211
Yes. -Yes.

692
00:46:56,113 --> 00:46:58,138
This is the difference
between the cultures.

693
00:46:58,182 --> 00:47:00,207
Their fathers change in no time.

694
00:47:01,151 --> 00:47:02,243
May they be doomed.

695
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:05,154
Nikki, why don't we show them
your childhood album?

696
00:47:05,189 --> 00:47:08,022
Okay. -I'll just go get it.
I'll go and get the album.

697
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:12,151
By God. -I'll be right back.

698
00:47:14,198 --> 00:47:16,098
Brother-in-law, saw
how her mother..

699
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:18,259
..changed her husband
in a minute?

700
00:47:19,169 --> 00:47:22,138
Have it in writing,
she'll change too.

701
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:27,076
Didn't I always say that these
Americans are cheats?

702
00:47:42,059 --> 00:47:43,083
Where is it?

703
00:47:45,162 --> 00:47:47,027
Album. Album.

704
00:47:51,134 --> 00:47:53,068
Come on. Brother-in-law
is calling you.

705
00:47:53,103 --> 00:47:55,071
Let's go. Let's go. -Come on.

706
00:48:10,254 --> 00:48:14,020
So.. this is me.

707
00:48:14,258 --> 00:48:17,193
And.. this is my mother. My
father. -First father.

708
00:48:18,128 --> 00:48:20,153
What do you mean? -Your mother
remarried, right?

709
00:48:22,099 --> 00:48:25,034
Yes. And he is..

710
00:48:26,036 --> 00:48:27,094
Who is he?

711
00:48:29,206 --> 00:48:32,175
Look at that, she doesn't know
who's in her childhood snaps.

712
00:48:32,242 --> 00:48:34,233
Shut up, Chadami. Let me see.

713
00:48:36,179 --> 00:48:39,171
Hey. How many brothers
does she have?

714
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:42,244
What did she say? -She says
you have many brothers.

715
00:48:42,252 --> 00:48:45,119
But she doesn't know they
are your boyfriends. -Oh.

716
00:48:45,255 --> 00:48:47,086
What did she say?

717
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:49,249
She says they are her
boyfriends, not brothers.

718
00:48:56,166 --> 00:48:58,191
How many boyfriends
do you have? -What?

719
00:49:00,037 --> 00:49:02,164
I have.. -I don't like
lndian culture.

720
00:49:04,141 --> 00:49:06,109
Wrong dialogue at
the wrong place.

721
00:49:06,176 --> 00:49:08,110
When we are asking her
who is Jamuna Das..

722
00:49:08,145 --> 00:49:10,136
..then why is she talking
about Ganga Das?

723
00:49:11,081 --> 00:49:13,140
Nikki, explain. Please.

724
00:49:14,217 --> 00:49:16,208
I mean, I don't like
lndian culture..

725
00:49:16,253 --> 00:49:18,244
..of not having many boyfriends.

726
00:49:19,056 --> 00:49:20,080
Aamna never had any boyfriends.

727
00:49:20,123 --> 00:49:22,023
She was only friendly
with one guy.

728
00:49:22,192 --> 00:49:24,057
She is saying Aamna doesn't
have any boyfriends.

729
00:49:24,094 --> 00:49:25,152
She's a very nice
and simple girl.

730
00:49:25,228 --> 00:49:28,163
When did she say that? About
being simple and nice.

731
00:49:29,032 --> 00:49:30,090
Uncle, it means the same.

732
00:49:30,167 --> 00:49:32,192
No boyfriends, means she
is simple and nice.

733
00:49:37,074 --> 00:49:40,043
What happened? -l
don't get sleep.

734
00:49:41,078 --> 00:49:44,241
Stop thinking too much about
girls and you'll get sleep.

735
00:49:45,048 --> 00:49:47,073
I can see devilishness
in your eyes.

736
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:50,244
Yes, so there was a bigger
problem than this.

737
00:49:51,088 --> 00:49:53,113
The same old fire and
firefly issue.

738
00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:55,181
As they say, how is
it possible to..

739
00:49:55,258 --> 00:49:59,160
..keep two lovers together
yet separate.

740
00:51:19,209 --> 00:51:23,043
Situ. Hurry up, it's going
to rain. Hurry up.

741
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:25,077
Nikhil. Son, give
me the clothes.

742
00:51:25,115 --> 00:51:27,174
It's out of the question. This
is not possible. It's impossible.

743
00:51:27,217 --> 00:51:29,082
You just said it will be done.

744
00:51:29,152 --> 00:51:31,143
I am not talking to you. I
am talking on the phone.

745
00:51:31,221 --> 00:51:34,088
It's very risky. You both
can't go out together.

746
00:51:34,224 --> 00:51:37,193
You have two options.
Yes or yes.

747
00:51:39,262 --> 00:51:42,060
Okay go. But take Nikki along.

748
00:51:42,065 --> 00:51:43,089
It shouldn't be that we
end up in trouble..

749
00:51:43,133 --> 00:51:45,158
..on the second day of the
plan. -Okay. Thanks.

750
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:50,137
Mr. Sukha, I am talking to you.

751
00:51:50,207 --> 00:51:53,040
I have brought the original
herb for you.

752
00:51:55,178 --> 00:51:58,170
But.. -Again but. Trust me.

753
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:01,174
It's only you I trust, Uncle.

754
00:52:01,251 --> 00:52:05,017
I will distribute the
wedding invites.

755
00:52:05,088 --> 00:52:08,057
The tea.. is so bitter.

756
00:52:09,159 --> 00:52:11,218
Father. There is something.

757
00:52:12,062 --> 00:52:13,154
I needed your permission.

758
00:52:13,196 --> 00:52:17,223
No, no. Don't embarrass me
by asking my permission.

759
00:52:18,068 --> 00:52:22,061
Order me. -At least listen
to what he is saying.

760
00:52:22,172 --> 00:52:25,005
You too.. You get angry
when he asks..

761
00:52:25,075 --> 00:52:27,066
..and you get angry also
when he doesn't.

762
00:52:27,177 --> 00:52:29,111
I am his enemy.

763
00:52:29,212 --> 00:52:31,146
Ask. What do you want to ask?

764
00:52:32,149 --> 00:52:35,141
Well.. Nikki wants to
look around Delhi.

765
00:52:35,285 --> 00:52:38,152
She has to stay here all her
life once she gets married.

766
00:52:38,255 --> 00:52:40,120
She can look around then.

767
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:43,125
Son, these things are not
right before the wedding.

768
00:52:43,193 --> 00:52:46,060
Mother, this is how
it is in America.

769
00:52:47,130 --> 00:52:51,226
Ask her to tour America. Here,
she'll have to stay as we say.

770
00:52:53,303 --> 00:52:55,066
Please, Papa.

771
00:52:56,139 --> 00:52:58,198
Please. -Let them go.

772
00:52:59,209 --> 00:53:01,234
Fine. Come back soon.

773
00:53:03,079 --> 00:53:04,103
Thank you.

774
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:07,082
Brother-in-law, whether
you believe it or not..

775
00:53:07,117 --> 00:53:09,085
..but there's something
fishy with this girl.

776
00:53:09,219 --> 00:53:12,052
Oh, God. -Why should I bother?

777
00:53:12,189 --> 00:53:14,054
Almighty.

778
00:53:15,091 --> 00:53:18,254
Ask your mother what she had
before giving birth to him.

779
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:23,028
Papa. Action. -Keys.

780
00:53:26,236 --> 00:53:29,034
Here's your handkerchief.
-Thank you.

781
00:53:29,105 --> 00:53:30,265
And here's your locket.

782
00:53:31,107 --> 00:53:34,076
Aunt has told you not to go
anywhere without it. -Oh.

783
00:53:35,178 --> 00:53:37,169
Did you take your wallet? -No.

784
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:40,044
You forgot, didn't you? -Yes.

785
00:53:40,217 --> 00:53:42,185
Here it is. -Thank you.

786
00:53:43,186 --> 00:53:44,244
Okay, bye.

787
00:53:49,226 --> 00:53:51,194
We will have to do it again. One
more time. Okay? Come on.

788
00:53:51,294 --> 00:53:53,228
Position. Position. Come on.

789
00:53:56,299 --> 00:53:59,166
Papa. Action. -Nikhil, keys.

790
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:02,095
Oh.

791
00:54:03,106 --> 00:54:06,041
Here's your handkerchief.
And here's your locket.

792
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:09,238
Aunt has told you not to
go anywhere without it.

793
00:54:11,214 --> 00:54:14,115
Did you take your wallet? -No.

794
00:54:14,217 --> 00:54:16,151
You forgot, didn't you? -Yes.

795
00:54:17,053 --> 00:54:18,145
Here it is. -Thank you.

796
00:54:18,188 --> 00:54:21,055
Okay, bye. -Bye. Come.

797
00:54:30,267 --> 00:54:32,030
Papa, that..

798
00:54:34,170 --> 00:54:37,071
Can I call you Papa?

799
00:54:40,143 --> 00:54:41,132
Yes..

800
00:54:42,145 --> 00:54:45,205
Papa, I have to go
to meet my friend.

801
00:54:46,149 --> 00:54:47,207
Can I go?

802
00:54:48,218 --> 00:54:52,086
Yes, but.. come soon.

803
00:54:54,190 --> 00:54:56,181
Okay, Papa. -Oh boy.

804
00:55:00,263 --> 00:55:02,231
Saw? Saw that Situ?

805
00:55:03,099 --> 00:55:05,033
Our daughter-in-law left
without permission..

806
00:55:05,068 --> 00:55:07,195
..without covering her
head and look at her.

807
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:12,199
She's a well cultured girl.

808
00:55:14,177 --> 00:55:17,112
Uncle. Uncle.

809
00:55:18,048 --> 00:55:19,106
Uncle.

810
00:55:20,216 --> 00:55:24,152
Sick are treated here, dead
are not brought to life.

811
00:55:25,088 --> 00:55:26,077
You..

812
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:31,059
Give him something. Hello.

813
00:55:36,232 --> 00:55:38,029
Okay.

814
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:39,226
Hurry. Hurry. Hurry.
Get in here.

815
00:55:39,269 --> 00:55:42,170
You guys have fun. -Bye, Nikhil.
See you later. -Thanks.

816
00:55:43,073 --> 00:55:44,131
Hi. -Hey.

817
00:55:45,108 --> 00:55:46,097
Let's go.

818
00:56:04,227 --> 00:56:06,092
Look around..

819
00:56:08,098 --> 00:56:12,125
..how beautiful is the
ambience once again.

820
00:56:13,236 --> 00:56:15,033
Isn't it?

821
00:56:15,205 --> 00:56:17,070
Let's live..

822
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:23,001
..the moment we've
got.. of solitude.

823
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:25,240
Isn't it?

824
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:29,218
The same old laughing and
making each other laugh.

825
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:32,248
Saying something then
feeling shy.

826
00:56:33,123 --> 00:56:38,026
Saying a few things
with your eyes.

827
00:56:38,161 --> 00:56:43,155
I like.. to keep looking
at your face.

828
00:56:44,067 --> 00:56:49,095
Now that you have come,
don't go back.

829
00:56:50,273 --> 00:56:55,176
This is what I pray for.

830
00:56:56,146 --> 00:57:09,150
My heart.. should always
beat.. just for you.

831
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:15,064
My heart beats.

832
00:57:21,137 --> 00:57:22,195
Stop. Stop. Stop.

833
00:57:23,072 --> 00:57:26,166
Here. Thank you.

834
00:57:27,177 --> 00:57:29,145
Nikki's here so..

835
00:57:31,147 --> 00:57:34,082
Oh boy. Hold this.

836
00:57:34,117 --> 00:57:38,247
This way will get lost.

837
00:57:39,189 --> 00:57:44,126
This is what you fear, right?

838
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:50,028
I am close by.

839
00:57:50,166 --> 00:57:55,229
I hope you trust me that much.

840
00:57:57,140 --> 00:58:02,009
Your each moment follows
me quietly.

841
00:58:02,212 --> 00:58:07,149
You give me a moment
in my solitude.

842
00:58:08,051 --> 00:58:13,079
Perhaps, this moment
is an excuse..

843
00:58:13,156 --> 00:58:18,219
..made up by God for us to meet.

844
00:58:20,129 --> 00:58:23,030
This is what I pray for.

845
00:58:25,235 --> 00:58:38,239
My heart.. should always
beat.. just for you.

846
00:58:41,217 --> 00:58:44,243
My heart beats.

847
00:59:07,076 --> 00:59:09,044
Stop. Stop. -There. Yes?

848
00:59:09,078 --> 00:59:10,170
Do you have a license?
-Nikhil went there.

849
00:59:10,246 --> 00:59:13,044
Keep the moped here. -What?
-Keep the moped here.

850
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:15,142
I am telling the truth,
Brother-in-law.

851
00:59:15,218 --> 00:59:17,015
I can take anyone's oath.
I am not lying.

852
00:59:17,086 --> 00:59:20,112
This girl isn't good.
Nobody heeds me.

853
00:59:20,223 --> 00:59:22,123
American hands are
behind all this.

854
00:59:22,158 --> 00:59:25,218
Otherwise, our Nikhil.. never.
He's not such kind of a boy.

855
00:59:26,095 --> 00:59:28,029
He's going around with
the other girl.

856
00:59:28,097 --> 00:59:30,224
Sister, don't mind it, but this
is not good. That's it.

857
00:59:30,266 --> 00:59:34,202
And it is good for you to have
cannabis all day and lie?

858
00:59:35,138 --> 00:59:37,197
Who me? At this hour? No.

859
00:59:37,273 --> 00:59:39,207
Come on. Take your
brother-in-law's oath.

860
00:59:40,043 --> 00:59:42,034
Why do you want me dead?

861
00:59:43,146 --> 00:59:46,047
Your brother is an addict
and will remain so.

862
00:59:47,216 --> 00:59:49,184
Nikhil has gone out
with some girl.

863
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:52,221
Nikki is at Tara's place, then
what are they both doing inside?

864
00:59:52,288 --> 00:59:55,018
Are their ghosts there inside?

865
01:00:11,107 --> 01:00:16,238
I wish my father had refused
for dowry during my wedding.

866
01:00:17,180 --> 01:00:19,148
At least I wouldn't
have got him.

867
01:00:20,216 --> 01:00:22,116
It's hot. It's getting very hot.

868
01:00:28,091 --> 01:00:30,150
Take this. Take two pills.

869
01:00:30,226 --> 01:00:32,251
You will go home and
sleep peacefully.

870
01:00:34,163 --> 01:00:35,221
Yes, so now the question was..

871
01:00:35,264 --> 01:00:38,062
..how many days did we
need for our plan.

872
01:00:38,134 --> 01:00:40,159
We had to fix the wedding
date accordingly.

873
01:00:40,236 --> 01:00:41,225
Though there wasn't
much tension..

874
01:00:41,304 --> 01:00:43,101
..about getting an
auspicious date..

875
01:00:43,172 --> 01:00:46,266
..because the priest who was
going to do that was my patient.

876
01:00:47,110 --> 01:00:49,078
Yes. The priest too.

877
01:00:49,212 --> 01:00:52,204
Now what should I tell you what
kind of people come to me.

878
01:00:52,281 --> 01:00:55,182
Are you sure the priest will
set your said date?

879
01:00:55,251 --> 01:00:57,276
He's my patient. -The priest?

880
01:00:58,054 --> 01:00:59,078
Yes. The priest.

881
01:00:59,155 --> 01:01:02,147
You all just tell me how many
days you need for the plan.

882
01:01:03,192 --> 01:01:05,217
I think it will take us 15 days.

883
01:01:06,129 --> 01:01:08,063
You? -Yes, it will be
done in 15 days.

884
01:01:08,097 --> 01:01:10,122
You? -Okay. -Good.

885
01:01:10,199 --> 01:01:13,191
Physician Tarachand is as it is
famous for the 15 days course.

886
01:01:13,302 --> 01:01:15,065
It's done.

887
01:01:15,238 --> 01:01:18,173
32 kilograms of marigold.
Careful.

888
01:01:19,108 --> 01:01:21,133
Yes. The place shouldn't
be much visible.

889
01:01:22,078 --> 01:01:23,204
Put the red one behind.

890
01:01:24,147 --> 01:01:25,205
Are all the arrangements done?

891
01:01:25,281 --> 01:01:27,249
Yes, they are done. -Yes.
-Look at this.

892
01:01:28,084 --> 01:01:30,211
I have bought a new shirt from
the flee market. -Chadami.

893
01:01:30,286 --> 01:01:32,186
It's new for me.

894
01:01:32,255 --> 01:01:35,224
Everything you do is
new, Mr. Chadami.

895
01:01:35,291 --> 01:01:37,088
Why are you smiling? -Chadami.

896
01:01:37,126 --> 01:01:38,252
Go and help mother.

897
01:01:40,196 --> 01:01:42,221
No one respects the new shirt.

898
01:01:42,265 --> 01:01:45,132
Hey. Hey. Hey. -What is it?
-What about the drum?

899
01:01:45,201 --> 01:01:46,259
What drum now?

900
01:01:47,103 --> 01:01:49,162
I had asked you to get
a drum from Shoki.

901
01:01:49,238 --> 01:01:52,071
Idiot. -Mother, I'll get the
drum but who will play it?

902
01:01:52,108 --> 01:01:53,097
You are too much.

903
01:01:53,176 --> 01:01:57,044
'Shava'. At night. 'Shava'.
Didn't come at night.

904
01:01:57,113 --> 01:01:59,104
Nikhil. Can I keep this
paper with me?

905
01:01:59,182 --> 01:02:00,240
No. We'll get into trouble.

906
01:02:01,084 --> 01:02:03,052
I have just remembered one song
with great difficulty.

907
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:04,177
What if I forget in the middle?

908
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:06,152
Then we'll surely
get into trouble.

909
01:02:06,189 --> 01:02:08,054
Keep it, dear. Keep it.

910
01:02:08,257 --> 01:02:11,090
Just be the soul of this
function tonight, dear.

911
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:14,061
Win everyone's heart. -Okay.

912
01:02:15,231 --> 01:02:17,222
Look, now it was time
to do something.

913
01:02:18,067 --> 01:02:19,261
Aamna couldn't get a
better opportunity..

914
01:02:20,069 --> 01:02:22,060
..to win the family
members' hearts.

915
01:02:23,106 --> 01:02:25,267
Now let's see if our vehicle
comes back on track or not.

916
01:02:29,212 --> 01:02:31,146
But after the interval.

917
01:02:31,247 --> 01:02:34,216
The black thread got
stuck at the latch.

918
01:02:34,283 --> 01:02:39,016
Brother-in-law fought with
his sister-in-law.

919
01:02:41,157 --> 01:02:44,126
No, no. I can't sing.
Sing it on your own.

920
01:02:44,227 --> 01:02:50,097
We get immense happiness.

921
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:57,036
When God is generous.

922
01:02:58,007 --> 01:03:03,070
Everyone gets together
and prays.

923
01:03:03,312 --> 01:03:09,217
May one heart never separate
from the other.

924
01:03:11,254 --> 01:03:15,190
The black thread got
stuck at the latch.

925
01:03:15,258 --> 01:03:19,251
Brother-in-law fought with
his sister-in-law.

926
01:03:28,004 --> 01:03:35,274
Don't fight handsome, she's
your only sister-in-law.

927
01:03:55,264 --> 01:03:59,030
My sweetheart didn't
come at night.

928
01:03:59,168 --> 01:04:01,227
Shava. He didn't come at night.

929
01:04:01,304 --> 01:04:05,138
He forgot. He didn't
come at night.

930
01:04:05,208 --> 01:04:07,267
Shava. He didn't come at night.

931
01:04:07,310 --> 01:04:12,213
I look left. I look right.
I look centre.

932
01:04:12,248 --> 01:04:17,242
If I don't find my darling, l
look for him in all the lanes.

933
01:04:18,054 --> 01:04:20,045
My sweetheart is here. -Shava.

934
01:04:20,089 --> 01:04:22,216
My darling is here.

935
01:04:22,291 --> 01:04:25,260
My sweetheart didn't
come at night.

936
01:04:26,028 --> 01:04:27,996
Shava. He didn't come at night.

937
01:04:28,064 --> 01:04:31,033
He forgot. He didn't
come at night.

938
01:04:31,067 --> 01:04:33,035
Shava. He didn't come at night.

939
01:04:53,089 --> 01:04:56,081
Bari Barsi had gone out
and he brought fairies.

940
01:05:00,229 --> 01:05:05,030
Girls of Punjab have been
brought up on milk and butter.

941
01:05:05,067 --> 01:05:07,058
Girls of Punjab..

942
01:05:20,283 --> 01:05:24,014
Bari Barsi had gone out and
he brought a mattress.

943
01:05:28,024 --> 01:05:32,154
Boys of Punjab marry angels.

944
01:05:57,219 --> 01:05:58,243
Priest.

945
01:06:02,158 --> 01:06:04,991
Select the best day.

946
01:06:06,028 --> 01:06:07,290
Even if it's after 15 days.

947
01:06:08,030 --> 01:06:09,190
Yes, yes. Okay. -Yes, a date
15 days later will also do.

948
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:14,269
Brother-in-law, why are they
stressing on 15 days?

949
01:06:15,004 --> 01:06:17,199
The planet position is not right.
-I think this priest is useless too.

950
01:06:17,239 --> 01:06:19,002
Why don't we fix the date on
our own, Brother-in-law?

951
01:06:19,075 --> 01:06:20,235
Shut up, Chadami. -What?

952
01:06:20,276 --> 01:06:23,245
For the wedding.. -What the
priest says will be final.

953
01:06:24,113 --> 01:06:27,207
Son, date has been fixed
for four days from now.

954
01:06:28,050 --> 01:06:31,019
Four days? But..Priest..
-Congratulations.

955
01:06:32,221 --> 01:06:35,019
But Priest.. -That's it. There
is no auspicious date..

956
01:06:35,057 --> 01:06:37,150
..available for many
months after this.

957
01:06:40,029 --> 01:06:42,156
I think Chadami was right.

958
01:06:42,198 --> 01:06:44,029
We will fix the date on
our own. -Yes, yes.

959
01:06:44,100 --> 01:06:47,069
What's the use of this drama?
-Yes, Brother-in-law. Yes.

960
01:06:47,203 --> 01:06:51,037
Shut up. It's not a joke, Tara.

961
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:54,004
What priest said is final.

962
01:06:54,210 --> 01:06:56,075
Come on, get up, Situ.
-Brother-in-law..

963
01:06:56,178 --> 01:06:58,146
We've to make the arrangements.

964
01:06:58,214 --> 01:07:00,239
What will we do now? I will
have to marry Nikki.

965
01:07:01,017 --> 01:07:03,042
You had said that the priest
won't refuse you.

966
01:07:05,187 --> 01:07:07,178
Priest. I have served
you so well..

967
01:07:08,024 --> 01:07:09,218
..and this is how
you pay me back?

968
01:07:09,258 --> 01:07:11,192
I gave you such medicines and..

969
01:07:11,227 --> 01:07:14,060
Those sleeping pills,
right? I slept well.

970
01:07:14,196 --> 01:07:16,255
I slept well. -What are
you saying, priest.

971
01:07:17,033 --> 01:07:19,194
It's possible that co-incidentally
you got the sleeping pills.

972
01:07:19,268 --> 01:07:21,236
And similarly, co-incidentally..

973
01:07:22,004 --> 01:07:24,029
..a date four day later
also got fixed.

974
01:07:27,009 --> 01:07:28,169
Now what should I tell you?

975
01:07:28,277 --> 01:07:31,269
My sleeping pills and
my miracle in five..

976
01:07:32,248 --> 01:07:34,216
..inutes pill in the same.

977
01:07:36,018 --> 01:07:37,246
There was confusion.

978
01:07:38,287 --> 01:07:40,255
No, not Sitander.

979
01:07:41,190 --> 01:07:43,055
I want photographer Pappu.

980
01:07:43,159 --> 01:07:46,026
The one who made Jeet's album.

981
01:07:46,162 --> 01:07:49,131
Yes, him. -Mother, how's
the brown one?

982
01:07:49,198 --> 01:07:50,995
Stop your sales pitch.

983
01:07:51,067 --> 01:07:53,035
I won't even use it
to mop floors.

984
01:07:53,169 --> 01:07:56,036
..it will cost me. -I think we
will have to go to Gulati Stores.

985
01:07:56,172 --> 01:08:00,006
5000? We will have to pose
unclothed in 5000.

986
01:08:00,042 --> 01:08:02,010
We will have to sell
off our clothes.

987
01:08:02,178 --> 01:08:04,203
Look, fix it on three
and a half. Okay?

988
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:07,010
Hang up now. -You have brought
very cheap things today.

989
01:08:07,083 --> 01:08:08,243
Chadami. -Yes.

990
01:08:09,018 --> 01:08:11,248
When will you switch on all the
lights of the house and show us?

991
01:08:12,021 --> 01:08:13,181
I am doing it.

992
01:08:13,289 --> 01:08:15,257
Now do you want me hanging
on an electricity wire?

993
01:08:16,025 --> 01:08:17,287
Oh hell. Hurry up.
Don't waste time.

994
01:08:18,027 --> 01:08:20,052
You keep cursing me
the whole day.

995
01:08:20,262 --> 01:08:23,231
Tara. Have you spoken to the
tent guy? -Yes, I have.

996
01:08:23,299 --> 01:08:26,268
Shoki! -Why this long face?

997
01:08:26,302 --> 01:08:29,271
Nothing. Where's Nikhil?

998
01:08:30,239 --> 01:08:32,230
You and your nephew
are the same.

999
01:08:33,042 --> 01:08:35,272
He cried on hearing that he's
getting married after four days.

1000
01:08:36,178 --> 01:08:38,305
Must be tears of joy. -Really?

1001
01:08:48,257 --> 01:08:50,191
We had done the planning
according to 15 days.

1002
01:08:50,259 --> 01:08:52,193
The misunderstanding happened.

1003
01:08:52,261 --> 01:08:54,229
What can we do? -But what now?

1004
01:08:55,197 --> 01:08:56,186
What now?

1005
01:08:57,299 --> 01:09:00,268
Chanchal. Is singer
Chanchal there?

1006
01:09:01,203 --> 01:09:02,227
Let me talk to him, please.

1007
01:09:02,271 --> 01:09:04,205
The red one is going there
on the terrace.

1008
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:07,167
Brother-in-law, switch
on the lights.

1009
01:09:07,276 --> 01:09:09,073
Look before you speak.

1010
01:09:09,178 --> 01:09:10,236
No. Forgive me.

1011
01:09:10,312 --> 01:09:13,281
What a house. I am trying
to call Chanchal..

1012
01:09:14,049 --> 01:09:16,210
and he's worried about the bulb.

1013
01:09:20,055 --> 01:09:22,216
Nobel guys, if you are done
with your meeting..

1014
01:09:22,258 --> 01:09:25,193
..then go and help that
useless Chadami.

1015
01:09:26,061 --> 01:09:27,221
Go and switch on the
lights. -Yes, Papa.

1016
01:09:36,272 --> 01:09:38,172
Here. Connect it there.

1017
01:09:40,276 --> 01:09:43,040
What's happening here?
-Mr. Chadami..

1018
01:09:43,179 --> 01:09:45,147
..we've heard that your
daughter-in-law's..

1019
01:09:45,181 --> 01:09:47,012
..friends will come
from America.

1020
01:09:47,049 --> 01:09:49,210
They will come, won't they?
-Yes, everyone will come.

1021
01:09:50,019 --> 01:09:51,987
I have just one desire.
-The strings..

1022
01:09:52,054 --> 01:09:54,181
Just let me shake
hands with them.

1023
01:09:54,256 --> 01:09:57,020
The terrace.. -I've never shook
hands with a girl from America.

1024
01:09:57,092 --> 01:09:59,026
36.. -Just a hand shake?

1025
01:09:59,094 --> 01:10:01,062
That will be enough for me.

1026
01:10:01,197 --> 01:10:03,165
Two on the gate. -Listen..

1027
01:10:04,066 --> 01:10:05,260
They will all come in
a bikini, right?

1028
01:10:06,068 --> 01:10:07,194
Why will they come in a bikini?

1029
01:10:07,269 --> 01:10:10,170
I have heard it's a tradition
there. -Hey bikini guys!

1030
01:10:11,006 --> 01:10:12,200
I will give you all
a tight slap.

1031
01:10:12,274 --> 01:10:15,266
Come on, fix the bulbs. He's
talking about tradition.

1032
01:10:17,046 --> 01:10:20,174
It's working. It's working.
Its light everywhere.

1033
01:10:21,283 --> 01:10:23,183
Look, it's shining.

1034
01:10:38,067 --> 01:10:39,193
I can't wear these.

1035
01:10:40,102 --> 01:10:42,070
Please, Nikki. You
have to wear this.

1036
01:10:42,104 --> 01:10:45,232
I can't. -Nikki, please tell
her not to do drama now.

1037
01:10:45,274 --> 01:10:48,072
Nikki, please, you have to wear
this. -How does one wear these?

1038
01:10:48,177 --> 01:10:50,168
Should I wear them and
show you? -No, no, no.

1039
01:10:50,246 --> 01:10:53,010
Nikki, this is the question
of us getting together.

1040
01:10:53,082 --> 01:10:54,140
This is the question
of our togetherness.

1041
01:10:54,183 --> 01:10:55,980
It's a question of
our love. Love.

1042
01:10:56,018 --> 01:10:57,110
Love is the most important
emotion..

1043
01:10:57,186 --> 01:10:58,210
..that actually binds
the universe.

1044
01:10:58,254 --> 01:10:59,983
It's the emotion that gets
two people together.

1045
01:11:00,055 --> 01:11:02,046
It's the element that.. that
leads us to liberation.

1046
01:11:02,157 --> 01:11:03,181
To salvage. To freedom.

1047
01:11:03,259 --> 01:11:06,057
It is the most important thing
for both of us, to get together.

1048
01:11:06,161 --> 01:11:07,219
Please. Please. Nikki,
you have to do this.

1049
01:11:07,296 --> 01:11:10,060
For once, for us, for.. for me
and Aamna to get together.

1050
01:11:10,165 --> 01:11:12,258
You have to do this. Please
just.. -She's gone.

1051
01:11:13,269 --> 01:11:15,260
Well. Okay. Okay.

1052
01:11:16,238 --> 01:11:18,263
Stop laughing and do the lines.
The scene is lengthy today.

1053
01:11:19,008 --> 01:11:19,997
Come on.

1054
01:11:20,276 --> 01:11:22,176
So much.. -Love.

1055
01:11:23,279 --> 01:11:26,271
There's so much love here that
rivers are also called mothers here.

1056
01:11:27,082 --> 01:11:29,243
In our country, love is..
-Listen, we really have to..

1057
01:11:36,292 --> 01:11:39,989
Mother, the pickle is old.
Should I throw it away?

1058
01:11:40,296 --> 01:11:44,027
It's old? Even I am old.
Throw me away as well.

1059
01:11:44,233 --> 01:11:47,031
We will keep it on the terrace
to freshen it up. -Okay.

1060
01:11:47,136 --> 01:11:48,967
No, dear. Carefully.

1061
01:11:49,038 --> 01:11:51,199
It's my most expensive
set. -Okay.

1062
01:11:53,208 --> 01:11:55,039
Chadami. -What should I do?

1063
01:11:55,210 --> 01:11:57,007
What is it? -There are a..

1064
01:11:57,079 --> 01:11:59,206
..Iot of things to be
taken to the terrace.

1065
01:11:59,281 --> 01:12:02,273
The pickle, wheat, mattress.
-So what do I do?

1066
01:12:03,018 --> 01:12:05,009
What do you mean, what do
I do? Keep them upstairs.

1067
01:12:05,087 --> 01:12:06,247
No, I don't want to do
such cheap things.

1068
01:12:07,022 --> 01:12:09,047
I'm going to get shampooed.
-Where are you going?

1069
01:12:09,091 --> 01:12:11,150
Quietly take each of the
things to the terrace.

1070
01:12:11,193 --> 01:12:13,252
I'm going to get shampooed.
-Tell me something..

1071
01:12:13,295 --> 01:12:15,126
..am I a servant of this house?

1072
01:12:15,197 --> 01:12:17,062
Why are you getting angry?

1073
01:12:17,166 --> 01:12:20,226
Okay, keep the pickle. We will
get the other things kept later.

1074
01:12:20,302 --> 01:12:22,065
I don't want to keep
these things.

1075
01:12:22,171 --> 01:12:24,230
Please keep them. Please.

1076
01:12:26,208 --> 01:12:28,233
Listen, I am just going to keep
the pickle. That's it.

1077
01:12:28,277 --> 01:12:31,144
I won't do any other thing after
this. I am telling you. -Yes.

1078
01:12:31,213 --> 01:12:33,147
Okay. -Stop barking and keep
these upstairs. Go.

1079
01:12:33,182 --> 01:12:35,173
Go, get lost. -Keep the pickle.
Keep the pickle.

1080
01:12:35,250 --> 01:12:37,218
They have made me a servant
in this house.

1081
01:12:37,286 --> 01:12:38,275
I was going to get my
hair shampooed..

1082
01:12:39,021 --> 01:12:40,181
..and they are asking me
to keep the pickle.

1083
01:12:41,090 --> 01:12:43,251
We even have to take the wheat
and mattress to the terrace.

1084
01:12:44,059 --> 01:12:46,186
No, ask him sweetly once.

1085
01:12:46,295 --> 01:12:48,195
Mother, no matter
how Chadami is..

1086
01:12:48,230 --> 01:12:50,095
..but he never backs out
from what he says.

1087
01:12:50,199 --> 01:12:52,258
He won't touch the wheat
as long as he is alive.

1088
01:12:52,301 --> 01:12:55,998
They sent me to the terrace.
Keep the pickle. Keep the pickle.

1089
01:12:56,305 --> 01:12:58,034
Here..

1090
01:13:49,057 --> 01:13:51,048
Come. Come. Come. Come. -Tara,
you are so strange.

1091
01:13:51,193 --> 01:13:53,024
You called me home at two
in the afternoon..

1092
01:13:53,061 --> 01:13:54,153
..saying you have to say
something important.

1093
01:13:54,196 --> 01:13:56,027
I am sure it must be
a cricket match.

1094
01:13:56,064 --> 01:13:57,224
No, the match is day
after tomorrow.

1095
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,025
Actually I wanted to tell you
something very important.

1096
01:14:00,102 --> 01:14:01,262
Tell me, what is it?

1097
01:14:02,037 --> 01:14:03,163
Not here, let's go
to the terrace.

1098
01:14:03,238 --> 01:14:05,229
Terrace? -Purshottam,
you don't understand.

1099
01:14:05,307 --> 01:14:08,071
There are some things which can
be discussed only on the terrace.

1100
01:14:08,076 --> 01:14:10,067
You are so weird. -Come with me.

1101
01:14:10,179 --> 01:14:11,271
Do you remember everything?

1102
01:14:15,250 --> 01:14:17,047
Don't worry, we will prompt you.

1103
01:14:17,085 --> 01:14:20,054
Your cue is lndia. Make an entry
as soon as you hear lndia.

1104
01:14:51,186 --> 01:14:53,245
Come. -We are here.

1105
01:14:54,256 --> 01:14:56,053
Now tell me.

1106
01:14:56,225 --> 01:14:59,194
The entire neighbourhood
is sunbathing. -Yes.

1107
01:15:07,202 --> 01:15:08,191
Nikhil!

1108
01:15:11,206 --> 01:15:14,107
Yes, Papa? -Forget your
papa, look over there.

1109
01:15:15,210 --> 01:15:17,178
The entire neighbourhood
is enjoying the view.

1110
01:15:22,217 --> 01:15:24,082
Nikki. -What happened?

1111
01:15:25,020 --> 01:15:26,248
What's up? -What happened?

1112
01:15:26,288 --> 01:15:28,188
Look at what you have done.

1113
01:15:29,258 --> 01:15:31,158
What.. what have I done?

1114
01:15:33,295 --> 01:15:36,128
Oh. Now I understand
why you are angry.

1115
01:15:36,198 --> 01:15:38,189
I got tanned a bit
too much. -What?

1116
01:15:39,201 --> 01:15:41,032
Chadami, leave.

1117
01:15:43,071 --> 01:15:45,005
I am talking to you.

1118
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:47,975
What are you staring at?
I can't see it anymore.

1119
01:15:48,076 --> 01:15:50,044
Family reputation
has been ruined.

1120
01:15:50,078 --> 01:15:51,136
Let's go, Purshottam. -But
everyone's watching.

1121
01:15:51,213 --> 01:15:53,044
You're taking me away.
-What's wrong?

1122
01:15:53,181 --> 01:15:55,206
Will our daughter-in-law's wedding
dress be ready in three days?

1123
01:15:56,018 --> 01:15:59,146
I don't know, Mother. You
returned the readymade one.

1124
01:15:59,254 --> 01:16:01,188
It had a backless top.

1125
01:16:01,256 --> 01:16:03,190
Now our daughter-in-law
will wear..

1126
01:16:03,258 --> 01:16:05,089
..a backless top in
front of others?

1127
01:16:06,061 --> 01:16:08,029
Give it to me, you will break
all the glasses. -What a joke!

1128
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:11,032
What went wrong? Why did you
disturb my sunbathing?

1129
01:16:14,169 --> 01:16:17,036
How dare you! You are asking me,
why did I bring you down?

1130
01:16:17,272 --> 01:16:20,105
Oh, that. You should be proud.

1131
01:16:20,208 --> 01:16:22,267
Your soon to-be wife has
such a beautiful body.

1132
01:16:23,078 --> 01:16:25,205
You aren't ashamed. You are
feeling proud of it, instead?

1133
01:16:25,247 --> 01:16:28,216
Yes. This is my life. -But..
but this is lndia.

1134
01:16:30,018 --> 01:16:31,007
India.

1135
01:16:33,288 --> 01:16:34,277
India.

1136
01:16:35,290 --> 01:16:38,225
India! -Yes, enough of
lndia. Go on now.

1137
01:16:39,161 --> 01:16:41,061
We've many customs
and traditions.

1138
01:16:41,263 --> 01:16:44,027
This is lndia. -Again lndia?

1139
01:16:46,234 --> 01:16:48,202
You know what is lndia?

1140
01:16:48,303 --> 01:16:52,069
India isn't just.. -The name
of a piece of land.

1141
01:16:53,041 --> 01:16:57,034
Yes. India is an emotion that
resides in our heart..

1142
01:16:58,013 --> 01:17:00,277
..where there is respect for
elders and love for the young ones.

1143
01:17:01,116 --> 01:17:03,016
We've no enmity with America.

1144
01:17:03,151 --> 01:17:05,016
Nor with your individualism.

1145
01:17:05,087 --> 01:17:09,023
But we always respect the
culture of the place we go to.

1146
01:17:09,291 --> 01:17:13,057
And we hope that when foreigners
come here..

1147
01:17:13,195 --> 01:17:15,163
..they should respect
our culture.

1148
01:17:15,297 --> 01:17:18,061
This isn't about your
individualism.

1149
01:17:18,266 --> 01:17:20,234
This is about respecting
the culture..

1150
01:17:20,268 --> 01:17:22,236
..of the country you
are staying in.

1151
01:17:23,071 --> 01:17:25,039
There is so much love
in our country..

1152
01:17:25,107 --> 01:17:28,167
..that not just humans even
stones are worshipped.

1153
01:17:29,044 --> 01:17:32,013
The woman of our country
says I belong to you.

1154
01:17:32,147 --> 01:17:33,171
Truth is God and God is
beautiful. -Aamna!

1155
01:17:33,248 --> 01:17:35,182
I.. I think the job has
been done. Please..

1156
01:17:35,217 --> 01:17:37,208
..take Nikki inside and get
her dressed, please.

1157
01:17:38,020 --> 01:17:40,079
Nikki, please go with
Aamna. -Yes.

1158
01:17:41,023 --> 01:17:42,251
Come. -Thank you. -Let's go.

1159
01:17:45,027 --> 01:17:48,053
This girl is from the other
religion, but is great.

1160
01:17:48,230 --> 01:17:49,254
Isn't she?

1161
01:17:51,266 --> 01:17:53,029
Just a minute.

1162
01:17:53,268 --> 01:17:56,032
This girl said everything
in Hindi.

1163
01:17:56,071 --> 01:17:58,039
Then how did this foreigner
understand it?

1164
01:17:58,273 --> 01:18:01,003
Would you have understood if she
would have said it in English?

1165
01:18:02,210 --> 01:18:04,007
No. -Then.

1166
01:18:04,212 --> 01:18:06,976
The emotion of the voice also
means something, Uncle.

1167
01:18:12,054 --> 01:18:14,079
Brother, drive a little faster.

1168
01:18:14,222 --> 01:18:18,249
Yes, sure. It's a
bus not a Boeing.

1169
01:18:19,294 --> 01:18:21,057
That's true.

1170
01:18:21,163 --> 01:18:23,222
Yes, so, Purshottam
and his family..

1171
01:18:23,298 --> 01:18:25,232
..had made a place for
Aamna in their hearts.

1172
01:18:25,267 --> 01:18:28,031
But how much? It was necessary
to find that out.

1173
01:18:28,203 --> 01:18:31,036
And to find that out we needed
to send Aamna to the place..

1174
01:18:31,139 --> 01:18:34,233
..from where every lndian's
religion begins and ends.

1175
01:18:35,043 --> 01:18:36,237
That's the kitchen.

1176
01:18:37,279 --> 01:18:39,042
Chadami. -Yes?

1177
01:18:39,181 --> 01:18:41,274
We are having snacks
here. -Spicy.

1178
01:18:42,050 --> 01:18:43,278
What if the confectioner comes
home? -No confectioner will come.

1179
01:18:44,019 --> 01:18:46,283
He called in the morning.
-Give me one. -Yes. -Why?

1180
01:18:47,055 --> 01:18:48,249
He had gone to meet
the physician.

1181
01:18:49,024 --> 01:18:51,015
I don't know what he told him,
he says he will come tomorrow.

1182
01:18:51,193 --> 01:18:53,058
He must be busy with some work.

1183
01:18:53,195 --> 01:18:55,993
Papa, we are getting married
in the court.

1184
01:18:56,031 --> 01:18:57,055
Then the confectioner?

1185
01:18:57,199 --> 01:19:01,158
Then what will I tell my friends,
relatives and acquaintances?

1186
01:19:01,236 --> 01:19:03,067
That my son is being stubborn..

1187
01:19:03,205 --> 01:19:06,174
..the girl and the boy will
continue to follow their religion..

1188
01:19:06,241 --> 01:19:09,210
..post wedding hence the wedding
is taking place in the court.

1189
01:19:10,011 --> 01:19:12,206
Come there for the
wedding party.

1190
01:19:13,315 --> 01:19:17,046
The reception will take place in
the park near the house, right?

1191
01:19:19,287 --> 01:19:22,984
Don't you sit opposite
Tara's clinic?

1192
01:19:23,058 --> 01:19:25,049
Yes, sir. I stand there
in the afternoons.

1193
01:19:25,227 --> 01:19:28,025
I come here on Sundays. -And
near the court on Tuesdays, right?

1194
01:19:28,063 --> 01:19:30,031
Yes, he is right. -I know. -Why?

1195
01:19:30,165 --> 01:19:32,224
The clinic is closed.
Nobody comes to eat.

1196
01:19:33,201 --> 01:19:36,034
Potato snacks. Delhi special.

1197
01:19:37,038 --> 01:19:38,266
Yes. -She has eaten it.

1198
01:19:42,177 --> 01:19:43,235
Eaten it? When?

1199
01:19:44,045 --> 01:19:45,103
Yes, she has come.

1200
01:19:45,180 --> 01:19:48,047
Come, sir. -What are you
doing here, Tara?

1201
01:19:48,183 --> 01:19:49,241
I saw you and came.

1202
01:19:50,018 --> 01:19:52,111
You were looking very nice
having the snack from a distance.

1203
01:19:52,220 --> 01:19:54,211
Physician, I was telling them..

1204
01:19:55,023 --> 01:19:56,149
..that this madam has come..

1205
01:19:56,224 --> 01:19:59,057
..and eaten the snack from my
place. She had come to your place.

1206
01:19:59,194 --> 01:20:02,061
Opium is a bad thing. It's
a very bad thing.

1207
01:20:02,164 --> 01:20:04,291
It makes anyone make up stories.

1208
01:20:05,066 --> 01:20:07,034
I am not making up stories.
I am telling the truth.

1209
01:20:07,068 --> 01:20:09,161
She had come. She had eaten
the snack. Right?

1210
01:20:09,237 --> 01:20:12,070
Buddhva's mother ran away? -Saw?

1211
01:20:12,207 --> 01:20:15,267
Both of them are addicts.
-Brother-in-law, did you hear him?

1212
01:20:16,044 --> 01:20:18,035
This is an American conspiracy.
-Shut up.

1213
01:20:18,079 --> 01:20:19,137
What? -Shut up.

1214
01:20:19,181 --> 01:20:21,046
You all should eat this.

1215
01:20:21,082 --> 01:20:23,175
I am not going home and cooking.

1216
01:20:23,218 --> 01:20:26,051
Don't worry, Mom. Nikki cooked
for everybody before coming here.

1217
01:20:26,087 --> 01:20:27,247
Right, Nikki? -Yes.

1218
01:20:28,089 --> 01:20:29,249
Wow! That's great.

1219
01:20:30,058 --> 01:20:32,026
Oh boy, this means she knew
that the confectioner..

1220
01:20:32,093 --> 01:20:34,288
..isn't going to come today. Did
you get that, Brother-in-law?

1221
01:20:35,096 --> 01:20:36,154
Whenever you open your
mouth to speak..

1222
01:20:36,198 --> 01:20:38,029
..you say the wrong
thing. -Who me?

1223
01:20:38,066 --> 01:20:40,193
Yes, you. -Okay. -God hasn't
given you a good face..

1224
01:20:40,268 --> 01:20:42,236
..you should at least
say good things.

1225
01:20:43,071 --> 01:20:46,040
It's possible she felt like
cooking for the family.

1226
01:20:46,107 --> 01:20:47,301
Right? -It's possible.
-How much?

1227
01:20:48,043 --> 01:20:49,237
Just give me Rs. 100 only.

1228
01:20:50,245 --> 01:20:52,213
It's a family matter. -Yes.
The rest, later.

1229
01:20:53,081 --> 01:20:55,015
The confectioner should
come in the morning.

1230
01:20:55,050 --> 01:20:56,244
Okay, I am leaving too.

1231
01:20:57,052 --> 01:20:58,110
Hadn't she come to have
the snack? -Where?

1232
01:20:58,186 --> 01:21:00,017
You'll go to the village. You'll
go by the next train.

1233
01:21:00,055 --> 01:21:01,181
You leave right now.

1234
01:21:02,224 --> 01:21:03,987
Aamna, dear. -Yes?

1235
01:21:04,025 --> 01:21:06,118
The snack was very tasty.
I am having indigestion.

1236
01:21:06,228 --> 01:21:08,253
Tara. -Yes? -Come. Come. -I will
freshen up and come. You sit.

1237
01:21:08,296 --> 01:21:12,164
Okay. -I am very tired, dear.
-Come. Come. -Oh God.

1238
01:21:15,170 --> 01:21:16,228
Sit down.

1239
01:21:17,272 --> 01:21:19,240
You should stop eating
these things now.

1240
01:21:19,274 --> 01:21:22,243
Snacks and all. You were having
one plate after the other.

1241
01:21:22,277 --> 01:21:25,007
Oh God. Look at yourself.

1242
01:21:36,224 --> 01:21:40,991
Today's Saturday. I don't
eat non-vegetarian food.

1243
01:21:43,031 --> 01:21:44,999
I am not hungry.

1244
01:21:46,167 --> 01:21:49,193
Dear, I won't be able to eat
this foreigner's food.

1245
01:21:50,205 --> 01:21:52,002
I get indigestion.

1246
01:21:53,275 --> 01:21:55,243
She should have at
least cooked it.

1247
01:21:55,277 --> 01:21:57,245
This is how American food is.

1248
01:21:57,312 --> 01:21:59,246
But there should be some choice
at least. -There is a choice.

1249
01:22:00,015 --> 01:22:01,209
What? -Eat it or leave it.

1250
01:22:05,186 --> 01:22:06,244
I will cook today.

1251
01:22:07,155 --> 01:22:08,213
Woman is food.

1252
01:22:09,057 --> 01:22:11,150
Why do you give her such
difficult dialogues?

1253
01:22:11,226 --> 01:22:12,989
What did you say?

1254
01:22:13,161 --> 01:22:15,152
She means a woman is
a Goddess of plenty.

1255
01:22:15,230 --> 01:22:18,028
And she will cook today. -Yes.

1256
01:22:18,233 --> 01:22:21,202
How can anyone sleep on an empty
stomach when she is at home?

1257
01:22:24,205 --> 01:22:26,070
Aamna, dear. -Yes?

1258
01:22:27,075 --> 01:22:29,168
Dear, let it be. Don't
go inside the kitchen.

1259
01:22:30,178 --> 01:22:32,271
But why? -Just like that.

1260
01:22:33,048 --> 01:22:34,242
Right, Purshottam?

1261
01:22:35,283 --> 01:22:38,047
No, dear. Go. Go.

1262
01:22:39,187 --> 01:22:40,279
Okay, Papa.

1263
01:22:42,190 --> 01:22:43,987
Mother. Sister-in-law. You saw..

1264
01:22:44,025 --> 01:22:46,016
..he let a Muslim girl
enter the kitchen.

1265
01:22:46,227 --> 01:22:48,024
So what, Tarachand?

1266
01:22:48,196 --> 01:22:50,221
She's a nice girl. -Right.

1267
01:22:51,299 --> 01:22:52,994
She's a sweet girl.

1268
01:22:53,068 --> 01:22:54,262
Yes, yes. -But it's against
our religion.

1269
01:22:54,302 --> 01:22:57,203
It's also against the religion
to insult the guest.

1270
01:22:59,207 --> 01:23:01,266
As if we are going to eat
food cooked by her.

1271
01:23:11,219 --> 01:23:13,187
Here. Let me take it. -Thanks.

1272
01:23:30,105 --> 01:23:32,005
I am not so hungry.

1273
01:23:35,043 --> 01:23:37,102
I don't feel well myself.

1274
01:23:38,179 --> 01:23:39,203
Let's go.

1275
01:23:39,247 --> 01:23:42,239
Forget it. I'll sleep on
an empty stomach today.

1276
01:24:03,304 --> 01:24:05,101
Aunt.

1277
01:24:06,241 --> 01:24:08,038
You should have eaten dinner.

1278
01:24:08,109 --> 01:24:10,043
It was very tasty, really.

1279
01:24:11,246 --> 01:24:13,077
You must be feeling hungry.

1280
01:24:14,015 --> 01:24:15,039
Water.

1281
01:24:15,216 --> 01:24:18,276
Curse you, I am not
feeling hungry.

1282
01:24:19,020 --> 01:24:20,078
Get lost.

1283
01:24:21,022 --> 01:24:22,011
Go.

1284
01:24:44,212 --> 01:24:48,046
Situ, you. -I was
feeling hungry.

1285
01:24:51,019 --> 01:24:53,044
You will eat that
girl's cooking.

1286
01:24:54,255 --> 01:24:57,019
What are you doing
here at this hour?

1287
01:24:57,292 --> 01:25:02,195
I am feeling hungry.

1288
01:25:05,100 --> 01:25:09,059
Walk quietly. If Purshottam
finds out that we..

1289
01:25:30,091 --> 01:25:32,059
Chadami, has the confectioner
arrived.

1290
01:25:32,193 --> 01:25:34,058
He's making all the
arrangements.

1291
01:25:35,029 --> 01:25:36,257
So, what will we have
for breakfast?

1292
01:25:37,031 --> 01:25:39,226
Let's order for fried fritters.
Shall I place an order?

1293
01:25:40,034 --> 01:25:42,195
Not for me. I will have
last night's leftovers.

1294
01:25:42,270 --> 01:25:47,230
Last night's Why will
you have leftovers?

1295
01:25:48,176 --> 01:25:50,235
Its okay, Father. I'll have
something from the fridge.

1296
01:25:51,045 --> 01:25:55,004
Situ, make breakfast for
him. -I have a headache.

1297
01:25:55,183 --> 01:25:58,016
Will it look good if he eats
last night's leftovers?

1298
01:25:58,086 --> 01:26:01,078
What's a headache compared to
the hunger of my child..

1299
01:26:19,307 --> 01:26:22,276
ASo, it was certain that all
doubts were cleared..

1300
01:26:23,011 --> 01:26:25,070
..and Aamna had won the
entire family's heart.

1301
01:26:25,213 --> 01:26:28,273
In the remaining two days, there
were only two things left to do.

1302
01:26:29,083 --> 01:26:30,243
You don't go.. -This
was the vest..

1303
01:26:44,199 --> 01:26:46,030
Is it sunny upstairs?
-Yes it is.

1304
01:26:46,167 --> 01:26:47,225
Come on, start. -Okay.

1305
01:26:48,269 --> 01:26:52,069
Nikki, can I ask you something?
-Yes, Uncle.

1306
01:26:52,240 --> 01:26:55,209
Are you never worried about
Aamna and Nikhil together?

1307
01:26:56,010 --> 01:26:58,205
These good friends can
turn into lovers.

1308
01:26:59,013 --> 01:27:00,173
Look Uncle, no way.

1309
01:27:01,015 --> 01:27:03,040
Aamna is perfect for
him in every way.

1310
01:27:03,184 --> 01:27:05,015
She liked him. -Then?

1311
01:27:05,253 --> 01:27:07,244
Nikhil knows that his family
will never tolerate..

1312
01:27:08,022 --> 01:27:09,080
..a Muslim daughter-in-law.

1313
01:27:09,157 --> 01:27:11,284
Oh. Nikhil and Aamna are
perfect for each other.

1314
01:27:12,026 --> 01:27:13,220
But no love between them,
because he's a Hindu..

1315
01:27:13,995 --> 01:27:15,121
..and she's a Moslem.

1316
01:27:17,065 --> 01:27:19,226
What's going on? -Nothing.

1317
01:27:20,034 --> 01:27:22,002
We are talking in English.

1318
01:27:26,207 --> 01:27:27,970
Brother-in-law. What's that?

1319
01:27:28,042 --> 01:27:32,103
A brother-in-law.
He's my relative.

1320
01:27:32,247 --> 01:27:34,215
Uncle, we have only three days
left and you are leaving.

1321
01:27:34,282 --> 01:27:36,250
I'll be back by tomorrow
evening.

1322
01:27:37,051 --> 01:27:39,019
And anyway, we have completed
most of the plan.

1323
01:27:39,053 --> 01:27:41,044
Listen, sit at home and
watch the match.

1324
01:27:41,155 --> 01:27:43,214
And, ask Purshottam to join you.

1325
01:27:44,025 --> 01:27:46,186
I'll be back by day after tomorrow
and take care of the rest.

1326
01:27:47,228 --> 01:27:49,992
It's an auspicious day today,
nothing will go wrong.

1327
01:27:50,064 --> 01:27:51,258
But your brother-in-law
passed away today.

1328
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:55,265
Yes, that's right. I mean,
nothing else will go wrong.

1329
01:28:01,175 --> 01:28:04,076
Who's he, Nikhil? -Mathew
Hayden, opening batsman.

1330
01:28:05,046 --> 01:28:07,014
Switch to the news for sometime.

1331
01:28:07,081 --> 01:28:08,241
They are showing the same thing.

1332
01:28:08,316 --> 01:28:11,183
Let us watch, Brother-in-law.
Look, here comes Murli.

1333
01:28:11,252 --> 01:28:13,243
What do you want me to do?

1334
01:28:14,022 --> 01:28:16,013
Brother-in-law, he's an expert
in bowling the 'Doosra'.

1335
01:28:16,057 --> 01:28:18,082
You understand, 'Doosra'.
He bowls the other one.

1336
01:28:18,192 --> 01:28:20,251
You are the second child
of your parents as well.

1337
01:28:21,062 --> 01:28:24,031
If I throw you, I'll be an
expert in 'Doosra' as well.

1338
01:28:26,200 --> 01:28:29,033
What's 'Doosra'? -That's
mystery ball.

1339
01:28:29,103 --> 01:28:31,037
Mystery Ball is the 'Teesra'?

1340
01:28:31,172 --> 01:28:34,073
What's a Teesra now?
-That's the mystery.

1341
01:28:36,277 --> 01:28:40,008
Have they returned, or
are they still there?

1342
01:28:40,214 --> 01:28:42,239
I did see Dhoni on television
yesterday.

1343
01:28:43,017 --> 01:28:44,177
Hockey is much better.

1344
01:28:44,252 --> 01:28:46,243
It gets over in 1

1345
01:28:47,255 --> 01:28:50,156
If it's lndia playing, this will
get over in 1

1346
01:28:50,224 --> 01:28:53,022
Hi, I am Michael Clarke.
-Brother-in-law, Gilchrest is out.

1347
01:28:53,061 --> 01:28:54,995
Now Michael Clarke
is coming to bat.

1348
01:28:55,063 --> 01:28:56,997
My favourite shot's cover drive.

1349
01:28:57,098 --> 01:28:59,259
He seems familiar.

1350
01:29:03,237 --> 01:29:05,068
He must be eating
potato snacks..

1351
01:29:05,073 --> 01:29:06,131
..near physician Tarachand's
clinic.

1352
01:29:06,207 --> 01:29:08,004
He must have asked you the time.

1353
01:29:08,076 --> 01:29:10,169
Stupid. -You must have
seen his photo.

1354
01:29:10,244 --> 01:29:12,974
You saw Clarke, and l
am getting beaten up.

1355
01:29:15,049 --> 01:29:18,018
I remember. I remember.
Now I remember.

1356
01:29:18,219 --> 01:29:20,210
The conspiracy of
the foreigners.

1357
01:29:20,288 --> 01:29:22,188
Yes, they win. They always win.

1358
01:29:22,256 --> 01:29:25,020
I am not talking about them.

1359
01:29:25,059 --> 01:29:28,028
Brother-in-law, try to remember.
The photograph.

1360
01:29:28,296 --> 01:29:31,094
What is it? -He always gets
zestful while watching the match.

1361
01:29:31,165 --> 01:29:33,224
Sit down, or else you
will get heartache.

1362
01:29:34,035 --> 01:29:36,128
Brother-in-law, believe me.
-Keep quiet, please.

1363
01:29:36,204 --> 01:29:37,228
Keep quiet, please.

1364
01:29:38,206 --> 01:29:40,174
Papa. Papa.

1365
01:29:41,209 --> 01:29:43,006
He's saying, call the doctor.

1366
01:29:43,077 --> 01:29:44,237
What's wrong? -Nikhil.

1367
01:29:46,013 --> 01:29:48,140
Nikhil. -I'll be back soon.

1368
01:29:52,019 --> 01:29:55,147
Lord. Please heed my prayers.

1369
01:29:59,227 --> 01:30:01,252
Doctor. -There's nothing
to worry.

1370
01:30:02,063 --> 01:30:04,190
By the way, it was a
mild heart attack.

1371
01:30:04,265 --> 01:30:06,256
It happens sometimes
to heart patients.

1372
01:30:08,102 --> 01:30:10,161
He'll be alright in a
week's time. -Okay.

1373
01:30:10,238 --> 01:30:13,173
By the way, he shouldn't
receive a shock.

1374
01:30:15,076 --> 01:30:19,035
And don't do anything
against his will.

1375
01:30:20,047 --> 01:30:21,275
Otherwise, he'll be alright.

1376
01:30:22,016 --> 01:30:25,179
Situ. -You go, Sister. I'll
see the doctor out.

1377
01:30:25,253 --> 01:30:28,051
Come on. -Son, everything
is fine.

1378
01:30:28,156 --> 01:30:31,023
The doctor has said there's
nothing to worry about.

1379
01:30:31,225 --> 01:30:33,159
Nikhil. -Yes Papa.

1380
01:30:33,995 --> 01:30:36,225
Nikki. Come here.

1381
01:30:39,233 --> 01:30:41,167
Situ. -Yes.

1382
01:30:42,170 --> 01:30:44,070
I have realised..

1383
01:30:46,040 --> 01:30:48,065
..that life's uncertain.
-Papa, please.

1384
01:30:48,176 --> 01:30:51,043
The doctor has said you'll
be absolutely fine.

1385
01:30:54,048 --> 01:30:55,242
Nikhil. -Yes.

1386
01:30:56,217 --> 01:31:00,176
I always misunderstood you.

1387
01:31:02,290 --> 01:31:04,258
But I won't anymore.

1388
01:31:07,161 --> 01:31:10,062
Now I will do as you want.

1389
01:31:12,066 --> 01:31:15,194
Tell me, what do you want?

1390
01:31:16,237 --> 01:31:21,174
I.. -I know what you want?

1391
01:31:25,279 --> 01:31:28,976
Nikki, give me your hand.

1392
01:31:34,288 --> 01:31:39,157
You two will get married. And
it'll be tomorrow morning.

1393
01:31:42,029 --> 01:31:45,123
I cannot wait for two more days.

1394
01:31:46,234 --> 01:31:49,032
Life is not trustworthy, Son.

1395
01:31:49,170 --> 01:31:51,195
Please rest for now.

1396
01:31:51,305 --> 01:31:54,069
Nikhil, go and get
the medicines.

1397
01:31:54,175 --> 01:31:56,166
And Chadami, make all
the arrangements..

1398
01:31:56,210 --> 01:31:58,144
..for going to the
court tomorrow.

1399
01:32:13,261 --> 01:32:14,990
What are you looking at, Uncle?

1400
01:32:15,062 --> 01:32:17,121
I will tell brother-in-law
everything.

1401
01:32:18,099 --> 01:32:20,260
What will you tell him?
-What will I tell him?

1402
01:32:21,102 --> 01:32:24,230
Nikki's boyfriend and Michael
Clarke's photo.

1403
01:32:27,174 --> 01:32:29,005
Trying to dupe me.

1404
01:32:29,076 --> 01:32:31,010
I saw this girl get down from
the rickshaw at the airport.

1405
01:32:31,045 --> 01:32:33,036
I saw her visiting
the physician.

1406
01:32:33,080 --> 01:32:34,980
There's something wrong
in this house.

1407
01:32:35,049 --> 01:32:38,018
Why are you looking at the
floor? Talk to me. Talk to me.

1408
01:32:38,085 --> 01:32:40,019
Uncle, lets talk about
this tomorrow morning.

1409
01:32:40,054 --> 01:32:42,989
Tomorrow morning! I'll
go tell him right now.

1410
01:32:44,191 --> 01:32:47,251
You should be ashamed. -Why?

1411
01:32:48,095 --> 01:32:49,289
Didn't you hear what
the doctor said?

1412
01:32:50,031 --> 01:32:51,055
He shouldn't receive a shock.

1413
01:32:51,198 --> 01:32:53,029
But you just want to prove what
a great detective you are.

1414
01:32:53,100 --> 01:32:54,158
Go, tell him.

1415
01:32:55,002 --> 01:32:56,993
Fine, I will tell
sister and aunt.

1416
01:32:57,038 --> 01:32:59,006
She will be shocked as well.
-Are you her brother or her enemy?

1417
01:32:59,073 --> 01:33:01,007
I will tell Aamna. -Go ahead.

1418
01:33:01,042 --> 01:33:03,203
I know everything. -So
what if she knows.

1419
01:33:03,244 --> 01:33:05,269
I have to say it. I
will tell someone.

1420
01:33:10,284 --> 01:33:12,184
Nikki. Come on.

1421
01:33:37,044 --> 01:33:39,171
Relax. -Relax!

1422
01:33:40,281 --> 01:33:42,215
Nikhil, you are getting
married tomorrow.

1423
01:33:42,283 --> 01:33:45,047
With someone else, and not me.

1424
01:33:46,287 --> 01:33:48,983
I won't. It's not
going to happen.

1425
01:33:50,291 --> 01:33:52,054
When is the marriage? Tomorrow.

1426
01:33:52,193 --> 01:33:54,218
And who has to make all the
arrangements in the court?

1427
01:33:54,261 --> 01:33:56,229
Uncle. And uncle..

1428
01:33:57,264 --> 01:34:00,062
And if tomorrow, the date of
marriage is not fixed..

1429
01:34:00,234 --> 01:34:02,031
..then, how can I get married?

1430
01:34:02,103 --> 01:34:04,003
And uncle is returning as well.

1431
01:34:04,205 --> 01:34:07,106
I think we will get some time to
think of a solution. What say?

1432
01:34:09,076 --> 01:34:10,202
So, just relax.

1433
01:34:26,260 --> 01:34:28,228
Mom, there's a small problem.

1434
01:34:29,196 --> 01:34:32,188
The date of the marriage seems
a bit difficult. -Why?

1435
01:34:33,034 --> 01:34:34,262
I have been trying
uncle's mobile.

1436
01:34:35,036 --> 01:34:37,231
I can't seem to get through.
And anyway, it's 5 o'clock.

1437
01:34:38,005 --> 01:34:39,199
The court must have closed.

1438
01:34:40,074 --> 01:34:41,200
Don't worry, son.

1439
01:34:41,275 --> 01:34:44,039
Your papa has made all
the arrangements.

1440
01:34:45,112 --> 01:34:47,171
Yes. Remember, Justice Chabra.

1441
01:34:47,214 --> 01:34:49,205
Your father's friend.

1442
01:34:50,284 --> 01:34:52,184
Situ. -Chabra uncle, Son.

1443
01:34:52,253 --> 01:34:56,155
The lawyer. -Yes. But now
he's a high court judge.

1444
01:34:56,257 --> 01:34:57,246
Judge. -Yes.

1445
01:34:58,025 --> 01:35:01,085
Your papa has made all the
arrangements with him.

1446
01:35:02,029 --> 01:35:03,189
Don't worry at all.

1447
01:35:03,264 --> 01:35:05,232
Yes Son, if we had relied
on Chadami..

1448
01:35:05,299 --> 01:35:07,164
..it would have really
hampered everything.

1449
01:35:07,301 --> 01:35:10,270
Come on, he's waiting. They are
about to leave. Come on.

1450
01:35:11,238 --> 01:35:14,207
Nikhil gets worried needlessly.

1451
01:35:17,044 --> 01:35:18,238
There must be some way.

1452
01:35:19,013 --> 01:35:21,277
Think. How do we stop a marriage
at the last moment?

1453
01:35:22,283 --> 01:35:24,183
The family members can stop it.

1454
01:35:24,251 --> 01:35:26,219
But the family members
are ready.

1455
01:35:27,288 --> 01:35:29,222
Nikhil, your family
members are ready..

1456
01:35:30,024 --> 01:35:31,252
..but Nikki's family can
stop this marriage.

1457
01:35:32,026 --> 01:35:33,118
But where's her family?

1458
01:35:33,194 --> 01:35:36,061
The family that we gave her it's
father has already changed.

1459
01:35:38,032 --> 01:35:40,193
Yes, get me mom. -Get me a mom.

1460
01:35:40,267 --> 01:35:41,996
You don't find mothers at
every nook and corner.

1461
01:35:42,036 --> 01:35:44,027
Get me a mom. Where can
I get a mother from?

1462
01:36:20,207 --> 01:36:21,970
What now, Nikhil?

1463
01:36:22,243 --> 01:36:24,234
I have found two foreigners.
But they are both busy.

1464
01:36:24,311 --> 01:36:26,211
I have left a message, but..

1465
01:36:32,086 --> 01:36:33,144
Uncle.

1466
01:36:42,196 --> 01:36:45,029
It's good that you knocked
Chadami unconscious.

1467
01:36:45,099 --> 01:36:47,033
Be careful, he's a rascal.

1468
01:36:47,301 --> 01:36:49,997
I won't get a bus or train now.

1469
01:36:50,204 --> 01:36:52,263
If I leave in the morning, I'll
be there by 10 o'clock.

1470
01:36:53,007 --> 01:36:55,999
But what about the foreigner?
-Where can I get one?

1471
01:37:13,027 --> 01:37:15,188
Nikhil, did you get
any response?

1472
01:37:17,164 --> 01:37:20,031
Any message, Nikhil.
For Nikki's mom.

1473
01:37:23,070 --> 01:37:24,162
Now what, Nikhil?

1474
01:37:29,210 --> 01:37:31,178
Nikki will have to
run away. -What?

1475
01:37:32,046 --> 01:37:33,172
Nikki, you'll have to run away.

1476
01:37:33,314 --> 01:37:35,043
What do you mean? -I mean..

1477
01:37:35,049 --> 01:37:37,142
..Nikki and I had a big quarrel
and she left home.

1478
01:37:37,218 --> 01:37:39,209
And how can I get married
without the bride.

1479
01:37:39,286 --> 01:37:41,254
What's most important is
this day to pass away.

1480
01:37:42,056 --> 01:37:44,047
You understood. -Yes.

1481
01:37:44,158 --> 01:37:47,025
But Nikhil.. -Aamna, we don't
have any other choice.

1482
01:37:47,061 --> 01:37:48,050
This is it.

1483
01:37:50,064 --> 01:37:52,259
But, papa.. -Aamna,
if I tell papa..

1484
01:37:52,299 --> 01:37:55,132
..that everything you saw
until now was a lie.

1485
01:37:55,202 --> 01:37:57,170
Then anything's possible.
Couples fight.

1486
01:37:57,204 --> 01:38:00,002
I mean, that's possible. I
mean, it just happened.

1487
01:38:02,042 --> 01:38:03,202
Okay. -Nikki. Come on, let's go.

1488
01:38:04,044 --> 01:38:06,035
But my bags. -You can
collect it later.

1489
01:38:08,048 --> 01:38:09,072
Come on, hurry up.

1490
01:38:14,188 --> 01:38:15,985
Are you going out?

1491
01:38:19,293 --> 01:38:23,127
Let it be. Nikki,
congratulations dear.

1492
01:38:26,033 --> 01:38:27,227
Your passport has arrived.

1493
01:38:29,203 --> 01:38:30,192
Passport!

1494
01:38:33,173 --> 01:38:36,233
Nikhil, you didn't tell me she
applied for lndian citizenship.

1495
01:38:37,211 --> 01:38:39,145
Our country is developing.

1496
01:38:39,213 --> 01:38:43,013
Within a week she has got her
citizenship and passport.

1497
01:38:43,217 --> 01:38:46,983
Did you get it done on immediate
basis? -Yes, Grandma,

1498
01:38:48,055 --> 01:38:51,149
Grandma, the passport.
-You won't get that.

1499
01:38:53,193 --> 01:38:56,185
Mauritius. -Mauritius.

1500
01:38:57,164 --> 01:38:58,290
We have some duties as well.

1501
01:38:59,033 --> 01:39:01,058
Don't you want to go
for your honeymoon?

1502
01:39:02,202 --> 01:39:04,033
No. You will have to go Son.

1503
01:39:04,104 --> 01:39:06,004
All the arrangements
have been made.

1504
01:39:06,073 --> 01:39:08,234
Just pack your bags.
-But grandma..

1505
01:39:09,043 --> 01:39:10,237
No ifs and buts, Son.

1506
01:39:11,145 --> 01:39:13,204
Give me a chance to
make you happy.

1507
01:39:14,248 --> 01:39:17,217
It's 8 o'clock, Son. We
have to leave by 9.

1508
01:39:17,284 --> 01:39:20,151
And you are still not ready.
Come on, hurry up. Come on.

1509
01:39:20,254 --> 01:39:21,278
Nikki, come with me.

1510
01:39:22,022 --> 01:39:23,046
We have to do the turmeric
ceremony. -Grandma.

1511
01:39:23,157 --> 01:39:26,217
You will become fairer. Come
with me, dear. Come.

1512
01:39:32,299 --> 01:39:35,063
Stop, just a minute.
-What is it now?

1513
01:39:37,071 --> 01:39:39,039
You two are still here.

1514
01:39:39,173 --> 01:39:41,141
Come on Son, we are
getting late.

1515
01:39:41,208 --> 01:39:43,199
Aamna, come with us.

1516
01:39:44,011 --> 01:39:46,002
He'll come along with Nikki.

1517
01:39:46,080 --> 01:39:48,173
Come on. We'll wait for you.
-Come on, Purshottam. Let's go.

1518
01:39:48,248 --> 01:39:50,148
Come on, we are getting late.

1519
01:39:51,018 --> 01:39:52,110
Where's Chadami?

1520
01:39:53,153 --> 01:39:55,212
He had to go missing today.

1521
01:39:56,223 --> 01:40:00,216
I'll find out. You go ahead.
-Fine. Bring him along.

1522
01:40:06,233 --> 01:40:07,257
Aamna.

1523
01:40:14,241 --> 01:40:16,266
All the plans were now
being thwarted.

1524
01:40:17,044 --> 01:40:18,272
It's getting out of hand.

1525
01:40:19,046 --> 01:40:22,140
The only good thing was the
children took care of Chadami.

1526
01:40:22,249 --> 01:40:24,149
You know what a rascal he is.

1527
01:40:24,218 --> 01:40:27,051
He would have ruined everything.

1528
01:40:28,022 --> 01:40:30,217
Let's go. When will we reach?

1529
01:40:34,261 --> 01:40:35,250
Uncle.

1530
01:40:47,174 --> 01:40:49,039
Go straight.

1531
01:40:51,211 --> 01:40:53,202
What is it? -Add some
more chillies.

1532
01:40:53,280 --> 01:40:56,147
Yes. What are you doing here?

1533
01:40:56,250 --> 01:40:58,218
Nikhil is getting married.

1534
01:40:59,019 --> 01:41:01,010
Everyone will be here soon.
I arrived before..

1535
01:41:01,088 --> 01:41:03,181
..to arrange everything.
-With that foreigner?

1536
01:41:04,091 --> 01:41:05,991
With that foreigner?

1537
01:41:08,228 --> 01:41:10,059
Here comes sister-in-law.

1538
01:41:11,065 --> 01:41:13,192
Sister-in-law. That one.

1539
01:41:18,105 --> 01:41:20,300
Finish this. -I'll be back.
Don't throw it away.

1540
01:41:24,144 --> 01:41:26,044
They are getting married
in the court.

1541
01:41:28,182 --> 01:41:31,015
Doesn't this foreigner
look a little old?

1542
01:41:31,185 --> 01:41:33,244
A monkey bit Ramcharan.

1543
01:41:34,254 --> 01:41:36,984
When will he go back
to the village?

1544
01:41:42,162 --> 01:41:44,130
Yes. -Yes. -Who are you?

1545
01:41:45,065 --> 01:41:48,228
Today my daughter is going to
get married. I have to stop her.

1546
01:41:49,103 --> 01:41:51,128
Nikki's mom. -Yes.

1547
01:41:51,271 --> 01:41:54,206
What's you husband's
name? -John.

1548
01:41:55,242 --> 01:41:58,234
John. Nikki's on her way.

1549
01:41:59,246 --> 01:42:02,010
Nikki's on her way.
Give me your phone.

1550
01:42:02,182 --> 01:42:05,242
What are you doing? -Try to
understand, it's an emergency.

1551
01:42:06,019 --> 01:42:07,043
What a strange man?

1552
01:42:08,155 --> 01:42:09,247
Who is calling?

1553
01:42:12,192 --> 01:42:15,059
Brother-in-law, don't disconnect.
-Useless man, where are you?

1554
01:42:15,095 --> 01:42:18,064
Brother-in-law, what is Nikki's
father's name? -Robert.

1555
01:42:18,198 --> 01:42:21,167
Robert. She's saying its John.

1556
01:42:21,268 --> 01:42:23,293
It must be the name of
her first husband.

1557
01:42:24,071 --> 01:42:26,062
Don't burden your brain.

1558
01:42:26,173 --> 01:42:28,266
Brother-in-law, there's
something I want to tell you.

1559
01:42:28,308 --> 01:42:31,209
Tell me after the marriage.

1560
01:42:33,113 --> 01:42:36,276
Dear, were daughter-in-law
and Nikhil ready?

1561
01:42:37,184 --> 01:42:38,173
Yes.

1562
01:42:40,187 --> 01:42:43,179
Let's go. -So, you are saying
you don't agree to this marriage.

1563
01:42:43,257 --> 01:42:45,054
Not at all. -Sure.

1564
01:42:45,292 --> 01:42:48,022
She seems to be angry. -Yes.

1565
01:42:49,229 --> 01:42:53,188
What's going on? -There was a
hailstorm at Haridwar yesterday.

1566
01:42:57,104 --> 01:42:58,162
Wait.

1567
01:42:59,273 --> 01:43:01,002
Brother-in-law.

1568
01:43:02,042 --> 01:43:03,270
We've reached.

1569
01:43:06,213 --> 01:43:07,271
Brother-in-law.

1570
01:43:08,248 --> 01:43:10,011
As such the doctor
has forbidden me.

1571
01:43:10,050 --> 01:43:13,019
But if you don't mind, I'll
have to give you a shock.

1572
01:43:13,120 --> 01:43:15,213
The bride's mother didn't give
her consent for the marriage.

1573
01:43:15,255 --> 01:43:18,019
What shock can be
bigger than this?

1574
01:43:18,192 --> 01:43:20,057
You know? -Yes.

1575
01:43:21,261 --> 01:43:26,062
How did you find out? -I met
her outside the court.

1576
01:43:26,233 --> 01:43:29,202
Greet her. She is
Nikki's mother.

1577
01:43:34,174 --> 01:43:37,166
If she is the mother,
then who is she?

1578
01:44:00,234 --> 01:44:02,259
What mystery is this?
Two mothers.

1579
01:44:02,302 --> 01:44:05,169
What is this? -Hang on.
Hang on. Hang on.

1580
01:44:05,205 --> 01:44:07,264
What? -This marriage
can't take place.

1581
01:44:08,041 --> 01:44:09,030
Why?

1582
01:44:10,244 --> 01:44:12,075
Her papa called in the morning.

1583
01:44:12,312 --> 01:44:16,214
In a car accident her
mother..died.

1584
01:44:16,250 --> 01:44:19,151
No problem. This is lndia.

1585
01:44:19,219 --> 01:44:21,983
We believe in life after death.

1586
01:44:26,226 --> 01:44:27,989
Mother.

1587
01:44:30,130 --> 01:44:32,223
Two mothers more. -Both of them.

1588
01:44:33,033 --> 01:44:35,058
He is your only son-in-law.

1589
01:44:39,273 --> 01:44:42,242
Physician, I tried
a lot. -Hang on.

1590
01:44:43,076 --> 01:44:45,135
The plan was thwarted.
You don't understand.

1591
01:44:45,212 --> 01:44:49,012
Teeshazari. -We've reached
Teeshazari. Move.

1592
01:44:49,182 --> 01:44:52,151
Stop here. Thank you, driver.
Thank you very much.

1593
01:45:00,060 --> 01:45:02,051
Excuse me. Please sign here.

1594
01:45:11,004 --> 01:45:13,199
Mother. Mother. Mother.
-Come. -Come here.

1595
01:45:14,007 --> 01:45:15,065
What happened? -Where are
the girl and the boy?

1596
01:45:15,108 --> 01:45:16,166
They are getting married inside.

1597
01:45:16,209 --> 01:45:18,074
This marriage can't
take place. -Why?

1598
01:45:18,111 --> 01:45:20,272
The family didn't give its
consent. Come. Come.

1599
01:45:21,014 --> 01:45:23,141
She is the girl's mother. She
is not giving her consent.

1600
01:45:23,250 --> 01:45:25,275
Nikki's mother, stand in
the queue. Come on.

1601
01:45:26,286 --> 01:45:27,981
Here.

1602
01:45:28,155 --> 01:45:31,181
Nikki is so lucky. She
has three mothers.

1603
01:45:32,225 --> 01:45:35,991
Three mothers. Purshottam, we'll
have to stop this marriage.

1604
01:45:36,196 --> 01:45:39,996
Look, we played a drama.
I'll tell you the truth.

1605
01:45:40,033 --> 01:45:42,058
Just stop this marriage. -Uncle.

1606
01:45:43,170 --> 01:45:44,228
We Agot married.

1607
01:45:45,105 --> 01:45:47,232
Nikhil, you married Aamna.

1608
01:45:49,242 --> 01:45:51,039
How is that possible?

1609
01:45:54,247 --> 01:45:58,013
You think only you
can play a drama.

1610
01:45:59,286 --> 01:46:02,187
Yesterday when I saw that guy
in the cricket match..

1611
01:46:02,255 --> 01:46:05,281
..then I understood that a drama
is being played with me.

1612
01:46:06,126 --> 01:46:09,254
So along with the doctor
I too played a drama.

1613
01:46:11,031 --> 01:46:15,024
Purshottam, I apologise to
you on the kids' behalf.

1614
01:46:15,302 --> 01:46:19,261
For the first time you've
done the right thing.

1615
01:46:20,073 --> 01:46:23,167
And you're apologising. Are
you a man or a fool?

1616
01:46:24,044 --> 01:46:25,068
A fool.

1617
01:46:26,113 --> 01:46:29,276
Today these kids have
shown me my folly..

1618
01:46:30,016 --> 01:46:32,246
..of believing in caste
discrimination.

1619
01:46:33,186 --> 01:46:36,212
They explained to me that a
person can be assessed..

1620
01:46:36,289 --> 01:46:40,055
..not on the basis of caste but
on the basis of humanity.

1621
01:46:40,193 --> 01:46:42,252
It is the biggest religion.

1622
01:46:44,064 --> 01:46:48,160
Tell me something. Who wrote
the dialogue of your drama?

1623
01:46:48,235 --> 01:46:50,260
Brother-in-law, she is
not from America.

1624
01:46:51,037 --> 01:46:52,265
She is from this country.

1625
01:46:53,006 --> 01:46:54,166
She hit me on my head.

1626
01:46:54,207 --> 01:46:57,199
And that physician too has
joined hands with her. -I know.

1627
01:46:57,277 --> 01:47:01,043
You know? Why didn't you tell
me? I wasted my time.

1628
01:47:03,283 --> 01:47:05,251
Who is this third lady?

1629
01:47:06,253 --> 01:47:09,222
I too brought a mummy.

1630
01:47:15,028 --> 01:47:16,996
Not mummy. She is Diana.

1631
01:47:18,265 --> 01:47:19,994
Chadami.

1632
01:47:20,300 --> 01:47:23,098
You never gave me the mobile
number, you jerk.

1633
01:47:26,072 --> 01:47:27,061
Uncle.

1634
01:47:28,175 --> 01:47:29,164
Aunt.

1635
01:47:30,210 --> 01:47:32,235
Uncle. Uncle. Uncle. It's done.

1636
01:47:34,147 --> 01:47:35,079
It's done.

1637
01:47:35,215 --> 01:47:37,183
It's done? -Yes.

1638
01:47:37,250 --> 01:47:39,241
If the government took
my medicine..

1639
01:47:40,020 --> 01:47:41,988
..then it will remain steady
for five years.

1640
01:47:42,055 --> 01:47:44,148
Have sweets. -Give.

1641
01:47:50,163 --> 01:47:51,994
I think the matter is fixed.

1642
01:47:56,069 --> 01:48:00,165
Will any one of these three
foreigners marry me?

1643
01:48:01,208 --> 01:48:03,176
The snack is ready.

1644
01:48:04,176 --> 01:48:14,176
