1
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:35,274
Ram..

2
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:48,150
Ram..

3
00:02:07,807 --> 00:02:09,434
Sita!

4
00:02:17,851 --> 00:02:20,342
Save us, your highness.

5
00:02:31,665 --> 00:02:33,997
Nooo!!

6
00:02:37,304 --> 00:02:39,568
Sita.

7
00:02:40,774 --> 00:02:42,765
No!!! Noooooooo!!!

8
00:02:45,512 --> 00:02:48,640
No! The same nightmares again!

9
00:02:50,016 --> 00:02:52,780
Only Guru Vishwamitra can save us now.

10
00:03:00,727 --> 00:03:02,854
Ashwamedh Yagna...

11
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:07,426
This is the only solution
to Ayodhya's misfortunes.

12
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,762
Ashwamedh Yagna!

13
00:03:08,868 --> 00:03:10,563
What is that, guru Vishwamitra?

14
00:03:10,637 --> 00:03:15,904
Prince Shatrughan, it is the
greatest of all royal rituals.

15
00:03:16,009 --> 00:03:22,505
Such a ritual if successfully
completed, promises power..

16
00:03:22,882 --> 00:03:29,446
..glory and prosperity to the
kingdom which has no comparison!

17
00:03:29,689 --> 00:03:35,286
But, only a great and
powerful king can take this risk..

18
00:03:35,395 --> 00:03:39,593
..for once the
Ashwamedh horse is let loose..

19
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:42,726
..it puts the whole
kingdom's honour at stake...

20
00:03:42,836 --> 00:03:45,202
Who can dare stop King Ram?

21
00:03:45,271 --> 00:03:48,502
With us three brothers by
his side, he is invincible!

22
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:53,136
Yet here we are, looking for
a solution to this problem.

23
00:03:53,513 --> 00:03:55,071
Aren't we, Shatrughan?

24
00:04:01,087 --> 00:04:08,584
And remember, at no cost
can this yagna be stopped..

25
00:04:08,662 --> 00:04:11,028
..else tragedy may befall.

26
00:04:11,331 --> 00:04:13,595
My subjects are my top priority.

27
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,458
l am willing to do
whatever is needed..

28
00:04:15,568 --> 00:04:17,195
..to assure their well being.

29
00:04:17,971 --> 00:04:21,668
This yagna will not be
stopped at any cost!

30
00:04:21,741 --> 00:04:27,373
Oh Suryavanshi Ram, l do not
doubt the purity of your intent..

31
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:30,276
..and the strength of your abilities.

32
00:04:31,084 --> 00:04:35,418
...but the basic
foundation of the yagna should be..

33
00:04:35,622 --> 00:04:42,721
..established by a family... that means
a wife, children.. a full family.

34
00:04:43,329 --> 00:04:49,290
Ram, with the queen Sita out of
your life, you are incomplete..

35
00:04:49,669 --> 00:04:55,505
..hence the yagna would
be considered incomplete.

36
00:04:59,212 --> 00:05:03,080
Yes. There is still hope...

37
00:05:05,618 --> 00:05:09,247
But you may not be
pleased with the solution.

38
00:05:10,356 --> 00:05:15,453
According to the
scriptures you will have to remarry.

39
00:05:16,429 --> 00:05:21,799
But... How is this...!? l...

40
00:05:23,369 --> 00:05:28,136
You.. know my love for Sita..

41
00:05:29,876 --> 00:05:33,710
King Ram, the choice is yours..

42
00:05:34,414 --> 00:05:37,508
..either continue to make
futile attempts at preventing..

43
00:05:37,584 --> 00:05:40,553
..your nightmares
from becoming a reality.

44
00:05:41,821 --> 00:05:47,487
Or perform the Ashwamedh
yagna and end this crisis..

45
00:05:47,594 --> 00:05:49,653
..once and for all!

46
00:05:49,863 --> 00:05:51,922
My work here is done

47
00:05:53,032 --> 00:05:58,800
But remember Ram, you must,
have a family.

48
00:06:02,442 --> 00:06:11,180
Oh Ram. Again another
new start, another hurdle.

49
00:06:12,719 --> 00:06:20,751
Oh Ram, wonder where
my life has brought me.

50
00:06:21,227 --> 00:06:26,062
Oh Ram.

51
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:33,500
Ram fought the enemies
with strength and valour.

52
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:40,270
Ram broke Shiv's bow
and brought Sita.

53
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:46,478
Being a King, he left the throne.

54
00:06:46,553 --> 00:06:53,459
Dreams were broken
by a wicked queen.

55
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:56,920
Oh Ram.

56
00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:04,031
For his father's honour,
they sacrificed their rights.

57
00:07:04,137 --> 00:07:11,566
Ram and Sita went into exile,
principles lost.

58
00:07:11,644 --> 00:07:18,106
Cruel Raavan took away
Sita through deception.

59
00:07:18,218 --> 00:07:26,125
Ram was left all alone,
all his dreams shattered.

60
00:07:28,528 --> 00:07:35,627
Ram reached Lanka after
overcoming all hurdles.

61
00:07:35,702 --> 00:07:42,608
He was a true lover.

62
00:07:42,675 --> 00:07:48,045
Again time snatched
away his happiness.

63
00:07:48,348 --> 00:07:55,186
A strange doubt gave
Sita exile once again.

64
00:07:55,288 --> 00:08:02,091
Saints gave solutions to Ram,
and he was helpless.

65
00:08:02,362 --> 00:08:09,268
Ram has no idea how to
reply to these solutions.

66
00:08:09,369 --> 00:08:12,930
Oh Ram.

67
00:08:13,339 --> 00:08:18,777
He was worried that he
will have to remarry.

68
00:08:19,512 --> 00:08:31,686
There is not
solution but there are two.

69
00:08:43,636 --> 00:08:44,933
Anything is left?

70
00:08:45,004 --> 00:08:46,096
No Luv.

71
00:08:47,273 --> 00:08:50,606
Our drama is going to be the best.

72
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:53,338
Yes, l feel the same.
-And we will make..

73
00:08:59,085 --> 00:09:01,815
Mother, we were only..

74
00:09:01,888 --> 00:09:04,584
Guru Valmiki wanted us
to collect materials..

75
00:09:04,657 --> 00:09:06,352
..for the Ramayan puppet show.

76
00:09:06,693 --> 00:09:09,218
We are planning to make
all the puppets ourselves!

77
00:09:09,295 --> 00:09:11,320
You are going to love them Ma!

78
00:09:11,431 --> 00:09:14,696
Will l? l would love even more if...

79
00:09:14,801 --> 00:09:19,534
Oh...l forgot. Look what l got for
you Ma.. your favorite, isn't it?

80
00:09:20,273 --> 00:09:23,709
Yes. l like it very much, Kush.

81
00:09:24,477 --> 00:09:29,210
But didn't Guru Valmiki also
tell you about the ceremony?

82
00:09:29,449 --> 00:09:31,576
Do you realize how late you are?

83
00:09:31,684 --> 00:09:34,050
Sorry mother, we were
going to be on time, but...

84
00:09:34,153 --> 00:09:35,711
But you know Kush..

85
00:09:35,822 --> 00:09:38,120
.. he can't think of anything
else besides the Gandharvas.

86
00:09:38,224 --> 00:09:40,419
Wonder when his
illusion will be fulfilled.

87
00:09:40,526 --> 00:09:42,255
Enough, Luv.

88
00:09:42,328 --> 00:09:44,523
Mother, l really heard
the sound of a Gandharva.

89
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:45,722
There is surely one atleast.

90
00:09:45,798 --> 00:09:47,356
That too deep in the forest.

91
00:09:47,433 --> 00:09:50,960
l know the Gandharva is real, mother,
l am telling the truth!

92
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:54,403
Yes, yes, l believe you. As always.

93
00:09:54,474 --> 00:09:56,635
l hope you were not
worried about us, mother.

94
00:09:56,976 --> 00:10:00,070
l never need to worry as long
as the two of you are together.

95
00:10:00,146 --> 00:10:01,306
Now enough talking.

96
00:10:01,381 --> 00:10:02,848
Get ready quickly now.

97
00:10:02,915 --> 00:10:05,042
Don't fight!

98
00:10:09,989 --> 00:10:15,154
My children, we gather
here today to give respect..

99
00:10:15,261 --> 00:10:16,990
..and blessings.

100
00:10:17,063 --> 00:10:22,968
We all know how Luv and Kush,
sons of Vandevi..

101
00:10:23,069 --> 00:10:25,697
..have protected our
hermitage many times..

102
00:10:25,805 --> 00:10:28,933
..with their valor and intelligence.

103
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:32,974
Hence l, Valmiki being their guru..

104
00:10:33,046 --> 00:10:35,810
..give them this pure gift.

105
00:10:37,917 --> 00:10:39,680
Swaaha!

106
00:10:41,721 --> 00:10:43,313
Swaaha!

107
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:51,221
Om..

108
00:10:52,698 --> 00:10:55,565
Oh Creator, Oh leader of the gods:

109
00:10:55,668 --> 00:11:01,265
May success come to
my efforts by your grace.

110
00:11:01,374 --> 00:11:03,672
May all the obstacles meet their end!

111
00:11:03,743 --> 00:11:10,615
l am immortal, l am blissful.
l am Brahma The Creator

112
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:19,520
This is a blessing from none
other than Lord Brahma the Creator.

113
00:11:19,592 --> 00:11:21,082
Remember children, ..

114
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:25,859
..these Divyakankan (Divine
Particles) have immense power.

115
00:11:25,965 --> 00:11:32,803
When you have learnt to respect
and call upon that power with..

116
00:11:33,239 --> 00:11:39,075
..your collective wisdom, you
will unlock their mysteries.

117
00:11:40,346 --> 00:11:44,783
All will be told as destinies unfold!

118
00:11:44,884 --> 00:11:46,249
Thank you guruji.
- Thank you guruji.

119
00:11:46,319 --> 00:11:53,157
Long live Guru Valmiki!
Long live Luv! Long Live Kush!

120
00:11:58,431 --> 00:12:00,490
Wow!!!

121
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:02,566
This is unbelievable!

122
00:12:02,668 --> 00:12:05,728
This is exactly like Ram and Laxman..

123
00:12:05,838 --> 00:12:07,533
..receiving divine
gifts and weapons...

124
00:12:07,607 --> 00:12:08,938
...from the great sage Vishwamitra..

125
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:10,633
..when they were young, and...

126
00:12:10,743 --> 00:12:11,937
Oh! There he goes again!

127
00:12:12,044 --> 00:12:14,274
...and do you know after..

128
00:12:14,347 --> 00:12:16,542
.. that they went on to
vanquish so many wars...

129
00:12:16,649 --> 00:12:18,241
Stop! Stop Bheelu! Please!

130
00:12:18,317 --> 00:12:20,410
We don't want to hear any more..

131
00:12:20,486 --> 00:12:22,954
.. we all know the
Ramayana here quite well!

132
00:12:23,322 --> 00:12:26,291
Yeah we remember all of it!

133
00:12:26,893 --> 00:12:29,361
Why are you all
making this fuss about..

134
00:12:29,629 --> 00:12:33,292
..these... Divya-kan-kaaan-kunaaas!?

135
00:12:33,799 --> 00:12:35,528
That's Divyakankan.

136
00:12:35,768 --> 00:12:37,929
And it will be good to
show it some respect!

137
00:12:38,004 --> 00:12:39,562
And why should we not raise a fuss?

138
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:41,163
just because you are jealous?

139
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:44,869
jealous? Of these? Guruji is
just humoring these two kids..

140
00:12:44,944 --> 00:12:48,505
..with toys to keep them
busy and out of trouble?

141
00:12:50,216 --> 00:12:54,152
And if l am wrong,
let's decide right now.

142
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:56,882
Tell them to prove themselves.

143
00:12:57,256 --> 00:13:00,419
Yes. Yes! Why not?
Luv, Kush, prove it to him

144
00:13:00,526 --> 00:13:02,391
Prove it! -Prove it Luv. -Prove it.

145
00:13:02,495 --> 00:13:05,862
Prove it Kush, Let's show it to him.

146
00:13:06,299 --> 00:13:08,529
Fine! How do you want us to prove it?

147
00:13:08,601 --> 00:13:10,933
What are you doing Kush? lgnore him.

148
00:13:11,003 --> 00:13:14,666
lt's pointless. We don't want
to get sucked into his games.

149
00:13:14,907 --> 00:13:16,966
No Luv, let's just shut
his mouth once and for..

150
00:13:17,076 --> 00:13:22,173
l will give you an opportunity to
do what you like doing the most...

151
00:13:22,248 --> 00:13:24,512
..you know...the whole..

152
00:13:24,584 --> 00:13:26,313
..compulsive-need-to-help-everyone ..

153
00:13:26,419 --> 00:13:27,818
..all the time and saving
people's lives etc, etc.

154
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,451
You see there?

155
00:13:31,023 --> 00:13:32,888
The Hindon River is receding.

156
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:34,984
We all know of the dying
forests and the barren lands..

157
00:13:35,061 --> 00:13:36,790
..because of the water shortage.

158
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:41,232
That lake on top of the
mountain is not really helping anyone.

159
00:13:43,469 --> 00:13:50,170
Why don't you use your new
powers to solve this problem?

160
00:13:51,477 --> 00:13:53,741
And if you can do that..

161
00:13:53,813 --> 00:13:57,408
..then l...
l would just have to shut up!

162
00:13:57,516 --> 00:13:59,108
Wouldn't l?

163
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,848
Kush, we are not ready to
use the Divyakankanas yet.

164
00:14:03,956 --> 00:14:07,915
But, l don't care.
l have to teach him a lesson.

165
00:14:08,027 --> 00:14:13,158
Fine! lf that's what you want,
l will take care of it...

166
00:14:13,266 --> 00:14:15,598
No. l will! l can do it by myself!

167
00:14:15,701 --> 00:14:18,670
No Kush! l don't want this
getting out of hand any more..

168
00:14:18,738 --> 00:14:21,536
..than it already has.
l will handle it.

169
00:14:21,641 --> 00:14:24,735
Fine! You never let
me do anything anyway.

170
00:14:25,044 --> 00:14:27,444
When will you stop
treating me like a child?

171
00:14:28,314 --> 00:14:30,179
Oh Creator, Oh leader of the gods:

172
00:14:30,716 --> 00:14:33,708
May success come to my
efforts by your grace:

173
00:14:34,053 --> 00:14:39,389
May all the obstacles meet their end!

174
00:14:39,792 --> 00:14:45,094
l am immortal, l am blissful.
l am Brahma The Creator

175
00:14:45,631 --> 00:14:48,031
Oh Creator, Oh leader of the gods:

176
00:14:48,134 --> 00:14:50,034
May success come to my
efforts by your grace:

177
00:14:50,102 --> 00:14:52,229
May all the obstacles meet their end!

178
00:14:52,305 --> 00:14:55,240
You do not have enough power.
Let me help you.

179
00:14:55,541 --> 00:14:59,500
Oh Creator, Oh leader of the gods:

180
00:14:59,812 --> 00:15:04,044
May success come to my
efforts by your grace:

181
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:06,812
May all the obstacles meet their end!

182
00:15:06,919 --> 00:15:11,049
l am immortal, l am blissful.
l am Brahma The Creator

183
00:15:11,157 --> 00:15:13,352
Speak softly, you are
ruining my concentration.

184
00:15:13,459 --> 00:15:15,757
Then leave it to me.
l can do it by myself.

185
00:15:15,861 --> 00:15:18,887
First learn how to work together.

186
00:15:19,432 --> 00:15:22,162
Oh Creator, Oh leader of the gods:

187
00:15:22,234 --> 00:15:26,068
May success come to my
efforts by your grace:

188
00:15:26,172 --> 00:15:29,198
May all the obstacles meet their end!

189
00:15:30,776 --> 00:15:36,078
l am immortal, l am blissful.
l am Brahma The Creator

190
00:15:47,193 --> 00:15:49,821
What happened to your powers?

191
00:15:55,401 --> 00:15:57,198
Quick, get everyone out of here!

192
00:15:57,303 --> 00:15:58,429
Hey Bangha..

193
00:15:58,504 --> 00:16:01,598
Hey look! The cliff is going
to collapse! -Yes.

194
00:16:04,443 --> 00:16:07,844
No! No! No, no! What have we done!?

195
00:16:07,947 --> 00:16:10,245
Brace yourself, Kush!
Now come on from here.

196
00:16:11,884 --> 00:16:13,681
Help!....God... help!

197
00:16:13,753 --> 00:16:16,449
My child.. l can't find my child..

198
00:16:16,856 --> 00:16:19,051
Somebody help me.

199
00:16:20,092 --> 00:16:23,459
My child.. Help! Somebody.

200
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:01,666
l told you, we were not yet ready.

201
00:17:06,205 --> 00:17:09,504
Now you owe me an apology Kush...

202
00:17:10,543 --> 00:17:14,877
What? Did you say something?
l can't hear it.

203
00:17:14,947 --> 00:17:16,915
Let it go, Agaj.

204
00:17:16,982 --> 00:17:18,609
Oh, how shameless!

205
00:17:18,684 --> 00:17:21,278
Let him bark, Kush.
lt won't make any difference.

206
00:17:21,353 --> 00:17:23,821
But alas it's not your fault..

207
00:17:23,923 --> 00:17:27,450
..that you don't have a real
father in your life to teach you..

208
00:17:27,526 --> 00:17:32,964
..a good lesson in obedience...
and discipline!

209
00:17:33,199 --> 00:17:38,501
After all, how much
can a poor gentle soul..

210
00:17:38,604 --> 00:17:41,402
..like your mother
teach you all by herself?

211
00:17:41,507 --> 00:17:43,134
Mind your language, Agaj...

212
00:17:43,242 --> 00:17:49,340
Okay, atleast tell us
what is your father's name.

213
00:17:50,883 --> 00:17:52,783
Because without a father you..

214
00:17:53,118 --> 00:17:59,216
Stop, Kush, leave him. Luv, Kush,
leave him... Leave him.

215
00:18:03,462 --> 00:18:06,090
You have brought shame to your guruji.

216
00:18:06,398 --> 00:18:09,060
Someone could have got
killed in that landslide!

217
00:18:09,134 --> 00:18:12,934
And if that was not enough...
you beat up Agaj!!

218
00:18:13,506 --> 00:18:17,169
So much anger in you both? How?

219
00:18:19,144 --> 00:18:21,635
You two don't have
anything to say for yourselves?

220
00:18:21,714 --> 00:18:24,512
just going to stand
there with you head hanging?

221
00:18:24,683 --> 00:18:27,015
But Mother, we said we are sorry.

222
00:18:27,086 --> 00:18:30,112
We already went to Agaj's house...
he is doing fine now.

223
00:18:30,222 --> 00:18:33,817
We apologized to him, his father,
his mother, his grandmother..

224
00:18:33,926 --> 00:18:36,224
l even apologized to his cat!

225
00:18:37,897 --> 00:18:39,694
You think this is funny, Kush?

226
00:18:39,798 --> 00:18:41,493
No mother, l don't.

227
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,262
But...do you know he
made fun of guruji..

228
00:18:44,336 --> 00:18:46,236
..fun of you and kept instigating us?

229
00:18:46,338 --> 00:18:49,569
We tried to ignore him... But...

230
00:18:50,075 --> 00:18:52,305
You both mean everything to me.

231
00:18:52,611 --> 00:18:55,876
But today.. today
because of this deed of yours..

232
00:18:55,948 --> 00:18:59,611
..everyone will now question
my ability in bringing you up!

233
00:18:59,685 --> 00:19:02,745
They already are saying this,
mother! Agaj blamed our failure..

234
00:19:02,855 --> 00:19:04,982
..on not having a father in our lives!

235
00:19:05,224 --> 00:19:07,351
What was our fault in it, mother?

236
00:19:08,661 --> 00:19:10,390
What should we have done?

237
00:19:10,462 --> 00:19:15,297
You should have walked away.
You know Agaj is just jealous of you.

238
00:19:15,434 --> 00:19:20,736
But guruji and l have taught
you better! Now leave me alone.

239
00:19:20,806 --> 00:19:25,743
Mother... due to us,
you are hurt today..

240
00:19:26,078 --> 00:19:30,811
..won't you forgive
your children, mother.

241
00:19:42,895 --> 00:19:48,697
'How long must l wear this mask?'

242
00:19:49,034 --> 00:19:52,834
'And carry on this daunting task?'

243
00:19:53,138 --> 00:19:56,369
'How long must
l hide behind this veil?'

244
00:19:57,543 --> 00:20:01,707
'lf l am tired, who
will help me get up?'

245
00:20:05,884 --> 00:20:13,484
Everything was beautiful,
when our love began to blossom.

246
00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:20,795
But suddenly dark
clouds came over us.

247
00:20:21,467 --> 00:20:25,233
Now suddenly things aren't bright.

248
00:20:25,304 --> 00:20:29,434
Dreams are shattered.

249
00:20:30,042 --> 00:20:33,671
l don't want to tolerate any more.

250
00:20:34,013 --> 00:20:37,676
l don't want to walk any more.

251
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:52,454
When? When will l be able to fly?
Far away. Far, far away.

252
00:21:01,974 --> 00:21:09,506
Once more there was
brightness in the sky.

253
00:21:09,848 --> 00:21:17,084
l got everything in our children.

254
00:21:17,456 --> 00:21:21,756
But this is just a temporary glow.

255
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:25,728
Again the shadow came back.

256
00:21:25,831 --> 00:21:32,634
My loneliness came back again.

257
00:21:33,038 --> 00:21:41,571
When will this trial by fire end?

258
00:21:42,114 --> 00:21:49,043
l wish we can always stay together.

259
00:21:49,455 --> 00:21:57,760
Wonder when this
wish will be fulfilled.

260
00:21:57,996 --> 00:22:05,926
l don't want to tolerate any more.
l don't want to walk any more.

261
00:22:06,271 --> 00:22:14,975
When? When will l be able to fly?

262
00:22:16,982 --> 00:22:24,320
Far away. Far, far away.

263
00:22:24,923 --> 00:22:32,193
Far away. Far, far away.

264
00:22:32,865 --> 00:22:43,002
Far away. Far, far away.

265
00:22:50,349 --> 00:22:52,874
What troubles you, my child?

266
00:22:53,552 --> 00:22:59,491
Guruji, my
sons...they have failed you.

267
00:22:59,858 --> 00:23:01,291
l am sorry.

268
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,521
ls that all?

269
00:23:03,595 --> 00:23:07,361
Today... they asked me
about their father, guruji.

270
00:23:07,466 --> 00:23:09,457
No matter what l had to go through..

271
00:23:09,535 --> 00:23:12,060
..l still want Luv-Kush
to respect their father..

272
00:23:12,137 --> 00:23:14,697
..and understand his decisions.

273
00:23:15,507 --> 00:23:19,534
But now... l...
l can't understand, guruji!

274
00:23:19,611 --> 00:23:22,307
Am l wrong by hiding
the truth from them?

275
00:23:22,414 --> 00:23:26,646
By hoping that one day they
will find their own answers?

276
00:23:26,752 --> 00:23:31,212
You are being too hard on yourself.

277
00:23:31,423 --> 00:23:34,358
You know, in all these years..

278
00:23:34,626 --> 00:23:37,595
..you have never
taken any wrong decision.

279
00:23:37,896 --> 00:23:40,160
You have always done the right thing.

280
00:23:40,265 --> 00:23:44,793
l have seen Sita,
the Queen of Ayodhya..

281
00:23:44,903 --> 00:23:50,500
..live like a humble
person Vandevi in my ashram.

282
00:23:50,576 --> 00:23:54,239
Raising two blessed sons with love.

283
00:23:54,313 --> 00:23:59,182
Your intentions were as pure
as the earth you came from.

284
00:23:59,251 --> 00:24:02,709
You have made a brave
choice and chosen a tough path.

285
00:24:03,188 --> 00:24:09,058
But, how long... l can be at peace only
when my family reunites...

286
00:24:09,127 --> 00:24:12,563
Don't despair, have faith, my child!

287
00:24:12,631 --> 00:24:13,791
But...

288
00:24:14,833 --> 00:24:20,601
And as far as Luv Kush are concerned,
leave that to me.

289
00:24:21,173 --> 00:24:26,839
Remember! All will be
told as destinies unfold!

290
00:24:26,945 --> 00:24:29,675
All... will be free!

291
00:24:35,053 --> 00:24:38,079
Do you know why
l have called you here?

292
00:24:38,156 --> 00:24:39,384
We are sorry, guruji.

293
00:24:39,491 --> 00:24:42,688
We made a mistake. Please forgive us.
- Forgive us.

294
00:24:42,794 --> 00:24:46,230
Raavan... was not a weak warrior..

295
00:24:46,531 --> 00:24:51,127
..he was a great king
and a greater scholar.

296
00:24:51,536 --> 00:24:56,473
But one grave mistake
changed his destiny.

297
00:24:56,575 --> 00:25:00,568
One mistake... is
what decides your fate..

298
00:25:00,679 --> 00:25:07,710
..either as Ram the hero
or Raavan the villain.

299
00:25:08,086 --> 00:25:12,182
That is what l have
strived to teach you.

300
00:25:12,291 --> 00:25:15,351
Guruji, you can take
these back as a punishment.

301
00:25:15,427 --> 00:25:18,225
We promise you to work
hard and earn it back...

302
00:25:20,198 --> 00:25:22,325
That won't be necessary.

303
00:25:22,801 --> 00:25:26,794
The true magic doesn't
lie in these bracelets..

304
00:25:27,339 --> 00:25:30,331
..but it lies within you..

305
00:25:30,809 --> 00:25:33,972
Why do these
bracelets obey your command..

306
00:25:34,046 --> 00:25:38,210
..and nature acts on
everything you call for?

307
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:41,314
lt's a sacrifice for a reason.

308
00:25:41,386 --> 00:25:44,184
The reason should
not only be selfless..

309
00:25:44,256 --> 00:25:50,889
..and pure but also worth
the sacrifice of mother nature.

310
00:25:51,496 --> 00:25:56,593
Learn from nature...
be like the rare Nuwali flower!

311
00:25:56,702 --> 00:25:59,865
What is that? Where do we find it?

312
00:26:00,072 --> 00:26:03,064
l have decided to
grant you another chance.

313
00:26:03,175 --> 00:26:04,301
Thank you.

314
00:26:04,409 --> 00:26:05,501
Thank you, guruji

315
00:26:05,577 --> 00:26:12,540
Oh l nearly forgot...
l have received an invitation...

316
00:26:12,617 --> 00:26:14,744
But l have to go on my pilgrimage..

317
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:16,515
..and you must not be..

318
00:26:16,588 --> 00:26:18,818
..interested in going to... Ayodhya!

319
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:23,327
lt seems King Ram is preparing for
the great Ashwamedh Yagna and...

320
00:26:23,395 --> 00:26:25,295
Ram! The real Ram!

321
00:26:25,364 --> 00:26:27,195
lt's true, Luv. lt's true!

322
00:26:27,265 --> 00:26:30,291
We will get to meet
the great Ram himself.

323
00:26:30,369 --> 00:26:33,770
Ram, Lakshman, Hanuman... Ayodhya!!

324
00:26:34,606 --> 00:26:41,011
But what about mother.. She is
still angry, she won't allow us to go.

325
00:26:41,113 --> 00:26:42,740
Leave that to me.

326
00:26:42,914 --> 00:26:45,644
Now listen, Darbha is
ready and waiting by ..

327
00:26:45,751 --> 00:26:47,616
..the Ashram gates with
the bullock cart to take you.

328
00:26:47,686 --> 00:26:51,053
And hurry up, before l change my mind!

329
00:26:51,156 --> 00:26:52,885
Thank you, Thank you, Guruji

330
00:26:53,225 --> 00:26:56,023
You are the best, guruji.
You made our dreams come true!

331
00:26:56,094 --> 00:26:59,586
Yeh!!! l will recite the entire
Ramayana to Lord Rama in one breath.

332
00:26:59,664 --> 00:27:03,691
And l will enact the scenes to him.
l still can't believe it!

333
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:08,567
You will believe it,
when you meet Ram!

334
00:27:08,907 --> 00:27:13,606
All shall be told,
as the destinies unfold...

335
00:27:22,421 --> 00:27:25,652
Fly us there Darbha. Ayodhya!

336
00:27:27,526 --> 00:27:30,290
Stop! We will also come with you.

337
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:36,294
Ayodhya, Ayodhya,
we are going to Ayodhya.

338
00:27:36,368 --> 00:27:40,566
Ayodhya, Ayodhya,
its a dream come true.

339
00:27:40,639 --> 00:27:42,766
We wonder what we'll see there.

340
00:27:42,874 --> 00:27:45,035
lt will be like my dreams.

341
00:27:45,143 --> 00:27:47,373
So pull up the cart.
Everyone come soon.

342
00:27:47,446 --> 00:27:49,846
And take us to Ayodhya.

343
00:27:49,948 --> 00:27:54,942
Ayodhya, Ayodhya,
here we come Ayodhya.

344
00:28:02,394 --> 00:28:08,799
Will we get to meet
King Ram and Queen Sita?

345
00:28:11,103 --> 00:28:13,367
Lakshman will show me
how to use a bow ..

346
00:28:13,472 --> 00:28:17,499
.. and arrow just like a fighter.

347
00:28:19,644 --> 00:28:21,805
l'll recite the Ramayan.

348
00:28:21,913 --> 00:28:28,079
l'll sing along with
the music of my sitar.

349
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:32,681
l will play with Hanuman's tail.

350
00:28:32,757 --> 00:28:41,597
And happily we will all
follow...Ram's trail.

351
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:46,228
Ayodhya, Ayodhya,
we are going to Ayodhya.

352
00:28:46,304 --> 00:28:51,367
Ayodhya, Ayodhya,
here we come Ayodhya.

353
00:28:57,048 --> 00:28:58,879
Darbha is it true?

354
00:28:58,984 --> 00:29:01,145
The streets are paved with gold?

355
00:29:01,253 --> 00:29:06,281
And the temple
bells are also golden?

356
00:29:07,759 --> 00:29:14,289
All the people sing about the
praise and glory of their king.

357
00:29:16,601 --> 00:29:20,765
A city of the Gods, its a paradise.

358
00:29:21,239 --> 00:29:25,175
lt glows like the Sun.

359
00:29:25,577 --> 00:29:29,536
Flowers and birds of
every shape and size.

360
00:29:29,614 --> 00:29:34,210
And grass so soft and green..

361
00:29:34,319 --> 00:29:42,556
..you can't take your eyes of it.

362
00:29:42,827 --> 00:29:47,264
Ayodhya, Ayodhya,
we are going to Ayodhya.

363
00:29:47,365 --> 00:29:51,426
Ayodhya, Ayodhya,
its a dream come true.

364
00:29:51,536 --> 00:29:53,834
How long before we get there?

365
00:29:53,905 --> 00:29:55,668
A little bit ahead.

366
00:29:55,941 --> 00:29:58,535
Look, friends. We have reached.

367
00:29:58,610 --> 00:30:00,669
We have reached.
- Hey!

368
00:30:00,745 --> 00:30:05,079
Ayodhya, Ayodhya,
Ayodhya, a wonderland.

369
00:30:05,183 --> 00:30:09,142
Ayodhya, Ayodhya,
Ayodhya, we are going there.

370
00:30:09,221 --> 00:30:13,681
Ayodhya, Ayodhya,
Ayodhya, a wonderful..

371
00:30:28,106 --> 00:30:30,131
We have reached!

372
00:30:30,242 --> 00:30:34,679
Reached? Where have we reached,
Darbha? This can't be Ayodhya!

373
00:30:36,581 --> 00:30:39,744
May be we lost our way, right Darbha?

374
00:30:39,818 --> 00:30:43,413
But you said Darbha knows the way.

375
00:30:44,256 --> 00:30:47,692
This is it,
children... this is your Ayodhya.

376
00:30:47,792 --> 00:30:54,027
This is so strange.
Let us ask those people.

377
00:30:54,099 --> 00:30:56,829
l had gone there, but it didn't
work out, so l came back. - Hello..

378
00:30:56,935 --> 00:30:59,733
..this is our first visit to Ayodhya..

379
00:31:00,038 --> 00:31:04,270
..and it's a lot different than
what we have heard in stories.

380
00:31:04,376 --> 00:31:08,244
Ah stories! Ayodhya
has also become like a..

381
00:31:08,647 --> 00:31:11,309
..never ending dark story.

382
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:14,141
Due to that people
started moving out of Ayodhya.

383
00:31:14,219 --> 00:31:17,245
But king Ram and his Ashwamedh....

384
00:31:17,322 --> 00:31:19,916
Ashwamedh! Only if it happens.

385
00:31:20,025 --> 00:31:22,255
Huh? Why not? Why won't it happen?

386
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:26,057
Because for that the
King will have to remarry.

387
00:31:26,164 --> 00:31:29,156
Remarry!! How can he do
that when he has Sita?

388
00:31:29,267 --> 00:31:35,172
Oh! Don't you know that King Ram
sent Sita into exile years back.

389
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:39,776
No! The Ram from our
guru's Ramayana can't do this.

390
00:31:40,045 --> 00:31:42,946
lmpossible! l mean why
would he exile Sita?

391
00:31:43,014 --> 00:31:44,538
What did she ever do to him!?

392
00:31:44,616 --> 00:31:47,585
Not to him! To Ayodhya.

393
00:31:47,952 --> 00:31:52,150
The people of Ayodhya found
it hard to trust someone..

394
00:31:52,223 --> 00:31:56,159
..who lived for a year in the
house of the evil demon Raavan.

395
00:31:56,261 --> 00:31:59,389
Even if she were the queen herself!

396
00:31:59,464 --> 00:32:00,624
That is ridiculous.

397
00:32:00,999 --> 00:32:04,526
She was not there by choice, she
was a prisoner against her will!

398
00:32:04,602 --> 00:32:06,593
And... if the preparations
for the yagna are being made..

399
00:32:06,671 --> 00:32:09,401
..that means Ram is remarrying!

400
00:32:10,642 --> 00:32:13,372
Maybe neither Ayodhya nor King Ram..

401
00:32:13,578 --> 00:32:15,512
..deserve a great queen like Sita!

402
00:32:15,613 --> 00:32:17,376
You are right. Let's leave!

403
00:32:20,118 --> 00:32:21,346
Where are we going?

404
00:32:21,419 --> 00:32:22,750
Back home.

405
00:32:32,731 --> 00:32:35,291
How can our Lord Ram be so selfish?

406
00:32:35,667 --> 00:32:37,965
How could he send his Sita away?

407
00:32:38,069 --> 00:32:40,367
lt must have been terrible for her.

408
00:32:40,472 --> 00:32:43,805
After she gave 14 years of
her life in exile for him..

409
00:32:43,875 --> 00:32:45,342
..this is what she gets in return?

410
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:47,173
This is shocking!

411
00:32:52,317 --> 00:32:54,785
But maybe we do not
know the whole truth.

412
00:32:59,624 --> 00:33:04,152
We are not going to get to
play with Hanuman's tail?

413
00:33:04,496 --> 00:33:07,954
No. Not today Sohan, not today.

414
00:33:15,473 --> 00:33:18,306
We need to ask guruji
about this when he is back...

415
00:33:18,576 --> 00:33:20,339
Maybe Lord Ram had his own reasons?!

416
00:33:20,412 --> 00:33:23,973
Right! You are talking as if
you know Lord Ram very well.

417
00:33:24,048 --> 00:33:25,208
Luv! Kush?

418
00:33:25,283 --> 00:33:26,944
Mother! -Mother!

419
00:33:27,419 --> 00:33:28,886
You both returned so soon?

420
00:33:29,254 --> 00:33:31,347
Guruji said you were going to..

421
00:33:32,023 --> 00:33:33,456
What happened, my children?

422
00:33:33,892 --> 00:33:36,019
We did not feel like seeing Ayodhya...

423
00:33:36,094 --> 00:33:37,857
...or the yagna.

424
00:33:37,929 --> 00:33:40,295
We want nothing to do
with him or his Ramayana!

425
00:33:40,365 --> 00:33:42,299
Don't worry children. Come in.

426
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:45,597
You can tell me everything
while you eat. Come.. come..

427
00:33:46,805 --> 00:33:49,968
Yes mother, in fact
our hermitage looks..

428
00:33:50,041 --> 00:33:53,238
..much more beautiful than Ayodhya.
We are better off here.

429
00:33:53,311 --> 00:33:54,403
He's right, mother.

430
00:33:57,015 --> 00:34:00,041
You know.. Lord Ram
left Sita years ago..

431
00:34:00,585 --> 00:34:03,053
...and now he's
remarrying for the yagna.

432
00:34:03,154 --> 00:34:04,348
Can you believe that?

433
00:34:04,456 --> 00:34:08,153
Had l been Sita, l would
have never forgiven Lord Ram.

434
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,518
But you are not Sita!

435
00:34:10,628 --> 00:34:13,188
And she is definitely
more understanding than you!

436
00:34:13,398 --> 00:34:15,195
What more is there to understand?

437
00:34:15,266 --> 00:34:18,235
Tell me, mother! What
would you do if you were Sita?!

438
00:34:22,807 --> 00:34:26,208
Well, had l been Sita my duty
would have been to fulfill..

439
00:34:26,277 --> 00:34:28,575
..my duties to the best of my
abilities which right now, ..

440
00:34:28,646 --> 00:34:31,774
.. happens to be..

441
00:34:32,083 --> 00:34:35,018
..raising up two devils like you.

442
00:34:35,687 --> 00:34:38,554
And then, when you two
are mature enough...

443
00:34:38,623 --> 00:34:42,150
..l will go away and
take some much needed rest!

444
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:43,420
No way...

445
00:34:43,528 --> 00:34:45,689
Spoilt kids like us would
never let their mother go away...

446
00:34:45,797 --> 00:34:47,196
We would use all our spells..

447
00:34:47,298 --> 00:34:49,562
..to keep you with us forever.

448
00:34:49,667 --> 00:34:56,539
One day l will have to go..
when you both can live without me.

449
00:34:56,608 --> 00:35:04,174
When will l be able
to go far.. far away.

450
00:35:05,917 --> 00:35:07,248
Do you know mother..

451
00:35:07,318 --> 00:35:08,683
Mother!

452
00:35:08,786 --> 00:35:10,447
Mother!

453
00:35:10,555 --> 00:35:12,580
Mother! Where are you?

454
00:35:12,891 --> 00:35:15,655
Mother!! Mother, where are you?

455
00:35:22,433 --> 00:35:23,695
Mother!

456
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:36,207
No! -No, mother! -No!

457
00:35:36,281 --> 00:35:40,547
We will save you.
-l will save you, mother. -Mother!

458
00:35:42,253 --> 00:35:43,720
This nightmare...

459
00:35:43,821 --> 00:35:45,914
About our mother being in trouble...

460
00:35:46,624 --> 00:35:50,458
This is so strange... and familiar.

461
00:35:50,562 --> 00:35:52,996
Too familiar, like it was almost...

462
00:35:53,097 --> 00:35:54,155
Real!

463
00:35:57,068 --> 00:36:00,037
Luv, she looked in real trouble!

464
00:36:00,939 --> 00:36:04,136
We cannot tell her about this.
lt will only upset her.

465
00:36:04,742 --> 00:36:08,371
Yes. l wish Guru Valmiki was here!

466
00:36:09,247 --> 00:36:11,010
What does the dream mean?

467
00:36:11,282 --> 00:36:12,943
Nothing will happen
to mother, right, Luv?

468
00:36:13,918 --> 00:36:16,546
No! Nothing will happen to her.

469
00:36:17,488 --> 00:36:18,955
Lets make a promise today.

470
00:36:19,757 --> 00:36:23,193
We'll never let
anything bad happen to Mother.

471
00:36:27,432 --> 00:36:28,956
Catch it Luv, catch it!

472
00:36:29,033 --> 00:36:30,364
Don't leave it, Luv!

473
00:36:30,468 --> 00:36:31,628
Don't leave it.

474
00:36:31,903 --> 00:36:34,371
Don't leave it!

475
00:36:36,608 --> 00:36:39,736
l told you, Luv would not
be able to catch the ball!

476
00:36:40,044 --> 00:36:43,275
He would have, if you knew
how to throw a ball properly!

477
00:36:43,348 --> 00:36:45,839
Well l would have thrown
properly like always..

478
00:36:45,917 --> 00:36:49,114
..if my arm was not
recovering from a bad injury..

479
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:54,021
We have apologized a
thousand times for that! Let it go!

480
00:36:54,092 --> 00:36:55,252
Shhhhhhhhh!

481
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:57,191
Huh! What happened?

482
00:36:57,295 --> 00:36:59,593
l hear something. Listen!!

483
00:37:01,032 --> 00:37:03,500
The monster Gandharva!!

484
00:37:03,735 --> 00:37:06,932
Quick, let's run back to the ashram!

485
00:37:16,547 --> 00:37:18,071
Wow! What a beauty!!

486
00:37:24,355 --> 00:37:26,550
Luv, let's take it home.

487
00:37:26,858 --> 00:37:28,951
Mother will be so happy on seeing it.

488
00:37:31,162 --> 00:37:32,595
l think it has lost
its way. Read the letter.

489
00:37:32,697 --> 00:37:38,135
Whosoever reads this, let it be
known that this is the horse..

490
00:37:38,236 --> 00:37:41,694
..of His Majesty, King
Rama's Ashwamedh Yagna.

491
00:37:41,773 --> 00:37:44,139
Ashwamedh Yagna!

492
00:37:44,208 --> 00:37:45,573
Read.. read!

493
00:37:46,577 --> 00:37:51,480
The entire expanse of earth
this horse traverses uncontested..

494
00:37:51,582 --> 00:37:55,245
..is to be henceforth
included in the King's kingdom..

495
00:37:55,319 --> 00:37:57,753
..and all rulers...

496
00:37:58,289 --> 00:37:59,779
All rulers shall
willfully submit their loyalty ..

497
00:37:59,857 --> 00:38:01,688
..to the glory of Ayodhya.

498
00:38:01,793 --> 00:38:04,523
Anyone who dares to stop
the Ashwamedh Horse does so..

499
00:38:04,629 --> 00:38:08,065
..at the peril of bringing
down the wrath of Ayodhya's army..

500
00:38:08,166 --> 00:38:11,693
..upon himself and his land!

501
00:38:11,803 --> 00:38:13,566
Ooooh!

502
00:38:17,408 --> 00:38:21,174
Ashwamedh yagna! This
means Ram did remarry...!!

503
00:38:21,245 --> 00:38:23,406
Now l will surely keep this horse.

504
00:38:23,481 --> 00:38:24,573
just let it go.

505
00:38:24,649 --> 00:38:25,809
Why should l let it go?

506
00:38:25,883 --> 00:38:29,284
l am sure Lord Ram will get a new
horse just like he got a new wife.

507
00:38:29,387 --> 00:38:31,855
Kush, you really need to
rethink this with a calm mind.

508
00:38:31,923 --> 00:38:35,916
Am sure this horse is not here by
itself and the army of Ayodhya..

509
00:38:36,027 --> 00:38:39,224
..will be here any moment!
We are not ready for a war.

510
00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:41,059
Don't tell me you are scared!

511
00:38:41,699 --> 00:38:43,064
Did you find the horse?

512
00:38:43,167 --> 00:38:44,600
Not yet.

513
00:38:44,702 --> 00:38:48,502
You both go to the west.
lt must be here. Go find it.

514
00:38:48,573 --> 00:38:51,167
Listen, you both.. -Did you hear?

515
00:38:51,242 --> 00:38:53,767
They must be near by!
Quick we must hide it!

516
00:38:53,845 --> 00:38:55,073
But, Kush...

517
00:38:55,179 --> 00:38:56,578
No time for ifs and buts.

518
00:38:56,647 --> 00:38:58,945
Are you going to support me in
this fight to protect the honour..

519
00:38:59,016 --> 00:39:01,541
..of our ashram or not?

520
00:39:02,153 --> 00:39:06,419
lf you put it like that,
l don't really have a choice do l?

521
00:39:07,825 --> 00:39:10,157
Take the horse deep into the forest.

522
00:39:10,261 --> 00:39:11,819
Hide it there and stay with it.

523
00:39:12,997 --> 00:39:14,396
What about you two?

524
00:39:14,499 --> 00:39:17,093
Don't worry Sohan. Lets go quickly!

525
00:39:17,368 --> 00:39:21,304
You don't worry and take
care of yourself. See you soon.

526
00:39:21,405 --> 00:39:24,033
Keep looking. Come behind me.

527
00:39:33,951 --> 00:39:36,181
Yes, this is it. This is a good spot.

528
00:39:37,021 --> 00:39:40,684
So Luv.. What is your
plan to overpower Lord Ram..

529
00:39:40,758 --> 00:39:43,693
.. and the entire army
of Ayodhya? Tell me.

530
00:39:45,129 --> 00:39:46,528
Overpower Ram?!

531
00:39:46,631 --> 00:39:50,465
Even Raavan could not manage that!
Who do you think you are?

532
00:39:50,768 --> 00:39:52,929
We are Luv and Kush,
who stand between..

533
00:39:53,037 --> 00:39:56,996
..your greed and the
sanctity of our guru's ashram.

534
00:39:57,074 --> 00:40:01,340
Leave now, or you will be killed.
Consider this our last warning.

535
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:06,711
You mere kids dare to
warn me? Shatrughan?

536
00:40:06,951 --> 00:40:10,580
Return the horse and you
will only loses the ashram.

537
00:40:10,822 --> 00:40:15,486
Else your poor mother will
lose both her precious gems!

538
00:40:24,602 --> 00:40:26,069
No no.. Kush!!! Stop!

539
00:40:44,055 --> 00:40:46,216
l agree that you are a good warrior..

540
00:40:46,457 --> 00:40:49,915
But a good warrior
knows when to back off.

541
00:41:03,074 --> 00:41:06,202
How did this happen?
This is not possible.

542
00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:10,412
Take your defeated
commander back. We have spared him.

543
00:41:10,481 --> 00:41:11,971
And tell your King Ram..

544
00:41:12,650 --> 00:41:16,984
..if wants his horse back..
he needs to come and face Luv and Kush

545
00:41:26,631 --> 00:41:30,260
The great Shatrughan!
This is unbelievable!

546
00:41:30,568 --> 00:41:33,469
l'm going to meet Hanuman soon.

547
00:41:33,537 --> 00:41:36,904
Not yet, Sohan!
Not until we sort this out.

548
00:41:43,281 --> 00:41:46,216
Never ever do that to me again.

549
00:41:46,284 --> 00:41:47,376
Do what?

550
00:41:47,451 --> 00:41:51,353
Come in between my fight.
That too when his defeat was evident.

551
00:41:51,455 --> 00:41:55,721
His defeat? l saved your life.
He would have killed you.

552
00:41:55,826 --> 00:41:57,817
l don't need you to save my life.

553
00:41:57,929 --> 00:42:01,558
What did you expect me to do,
sit back and watch you die?

554
00:42:01,666 --> 00:42:03,827
At least that would have
been better than this insult.

555
00:42:03,935 --> 00:42:06,267
Oh come on, Kush! Forget it.

556
00:42:06,337 --> 00:42:08,362
l am sure by now the
news has reached Ram.

557
00:42:08,472 --> 00:42:12,306
lt's the time to prepare for a
bigger battle. Listen to my plan.

558
00:42:12,843 --> 00:42:16,335
Yes! Why not! lt's
always you.. and your plan.

559
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:18,844
Who made you the
leader in the first place?

560
00:42:18,916 --> 00:42:21,476
Oh! Then why don't
you go ahead and make..

561
00:42:21,585 --> 00:42:25,180
..one of your random
improvised plans, huh?

562
00:42:26,290 --> 00:42:27,882
Maybe we will win with your plans.

563
00:42:27,992 --> 00:42:29,960
You really think you are
better than me? Don't you?

564
00:42:30,061 --> 00:42:32,495
Better and definitely more sensible!

565
00:42:32,596 --> 00:42:34,860
l don't go around
inviting unnecessary troubles.

566
00:42:34,932 --> 00:42:38,698
Oh! lf being lazy and a coward
means sensible then you surely are.

567
00:42:38,769 --> 00:42:40,293
Do you know because of you
and your cowardly planning..

568
00:42:40,404 --> 00:42:44,773
..we will lose this battle.

569
00:42:44,842 --> 00:42:47,606
We could have avoided this
battle in the first place.

570
00:42:47,712 --> 00:42:50,078
lt is only because of
you and your giant ego ..

571
00:42:50,147 --> 00:42:52,479
..that we are in this position!

572
00:42:52,550 --> 00:42:56,919
And you know what? lt was that
same ego that led to the landslide.

573
00:42:57,021 --> 00:42:59,615
When will you grow up,
Kush? When? Huh?

574
00:42:59,724 --> 00:43:01,487
What do you mean when will l grow up?

575
00:43:01,592 --> 00:43:03,457
You were equally responsible
for what happened at the ashram.

576
00:43:03,561 --> 00:43:05,722
lf you were so sensible..
Then why didn't you back off.

577
00:43:05,830 --> 00:43:08,697
Tell me.
- Oh yeah, yeah.. yeah right!

578
00:43:10,067 --> 00:43:11,227
You know, Kush..

579
00:43:11,335 --> 00:43:14,270
l should have.
l regret not doing that.

580
00:43:14,805 --> 00:43:19,071
Don't be so naiive, Luv.
Everybody knows whose mistake it was.

581
00:43:19,143 --> 00:43:22,271
Really? ls that what you think?

582
00:43:26,417 --> 00:43:29,318
Fine, if this is what everyone thinks.

583
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:31,047
lt will be better
if l leave from here.

584
00:43:31,155 --> 00:43:34,147
Fine! Leave. You
can't do anything else.

585
00:43:40,931 --> 00:43:42,023
My brother..

586
00:43:42,133 --> 00:43:46,331
So it is true! How could they?

587
00:43:46,404 --> 00:43:50,738
Let me go, brother. l will kill them!

588
00:43:51,008 --> 00:43:53,738
Lakshman, patience.. my brother.

589
00:43:54,211 --> 00:43:59,239
lt is distressing. But we must
remember, that they are just children.

590
00:43:59,517 --> 00:44:02,077
But brother,
they managed to defeat Shatrughan.

591
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:03,513
Surely not a feat for mere children!

592
00:44:03,587 --> 00:44:04,781
Excuse us, your Highness.

593
00:44:04,889 --> 00:44:08,620
But you are needed back
immediately at the Ashwamedh Yagna..

594
00:44:08,692 --> 00:44:10,523
..before the
auspicious hour passes away.

595
00:44:11,595 --> 00:44:15,964
Do not worry, brother,
l will not be too hard on them.

596
00:44:16,067 --> 00:44:18,001
But l will teach them a lesson ..

597
00:44:18,269 --> 00:44:21,033
..and bring them back
to you to apologize.

598
00:44:21,105 --> 00:44:22,732
Take the army with you, Lakshman.

599
00:44:23,207 --> 00:44:24,333
As you wish!

600
00:44:35,619 --> 00:44:37,917
He cannot keep treating me like this.

601
00:44:38,689 --> 00:44:41,749
Being a few minutes younger
does not make one smaller.

602
00:45:01,779 --> 00:45:04,145
l saw what happened there.

603
00:45:04,248 --> 00:45:05,579
You better leave me alone.

604
00:45:05,649 --> 00:45:08,413
l understand how you feel, Kush.

605
00:45:08,652 --> 00:45:12,383
l have seen many times
how Luv bosses over you.

606
00:45:12,623 --> 00:45:14,284
This time too it is not your fault!

607
00:45:15,259 --> 00:45:17,523
No. Luv is right,

608
00:45:18,028 --> 00:45:20,895
l have been very selfish
to lead everybody into this.

609
00:45:20,965 --> 00:45:23,832
lf what you are saying is true..

610
00:45:23,934 --> 00:45:26,198
..why is Luv so happy now?

611
00:45:26,504 --> 00:45:29,337
To think of it, he should be happy.

612
00:45:29,673 --> 00:45:35,703
After all he has total control now.
That's.. what he always wanted.

613
00:45:35,779 --> 00:45:37,076
Mind your tongue, Agaj.

614
00:45:37,148 --> 00:45:39,309
Don't forget you are
talking about my brother.

615
00:45:39,416 --> 00:45:44,115
Ambition and power makes brothers
forget their blood ties, my friend.

616
00:45:46,257 --> 00:45:47,849
l know your plan..

617
00:45:48,125 --> 00:45:49,888
Trying to poison me
against my brother, ..

618
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:52,929
..but that is not going to work.

619
00:45:54,031 --> 00:45:57,364
Poisoning? lf that's what you think..

620
00:45:57,468 --> 00:45:59,936
..then... then how
do you explain this!?

621
00:46:00,938 --> 00:46:02,906
The leaf from the Ashwamedh horse.

622
00:46:03,274 --> 00:46:06,971
Which l took from Luv
when he was not looking!

623
00:46:07,077 --> 00:46:09,705
l don't understand?
What does this prove?

624
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:13,716
Oh innocent, Kush! Don't you see?

625
00:46:14,418 --> 00:46:17,945
Now that he has removed
you out of the picture..

626
00:46:18,022 --> 00:46:22,425
..he will show this leaf as proof
to all at the ashram and guruji..

627
00:46:22,526 --> 00:46:26,519
..and take all the credit..
and praise!

628
00:46:26,630 --> 00:46:29,724
He has played a well thought game.

629
00:46:33,370 --> 00:46:37,101
Fine. lf Luv does not need Kush..

630
00:46:37,441 --> 00:46:39,841
..then Kush can do without Luv too.

631
00:47:37,501 --> 00:47:43,201
Luv! lts here! l can see an army
approaching. They are moving fast.

632
00:47:43,307 --> 00:47:47,403
Good job, Mangal. Everyone take
your positions like we planned.

633
00:47:47,511 --> 00:47:49,536
Bheelu, you and Sohan
take Bhaga, Naghol..

634
00:47:49,647 --> 00:47:51,979
..Rudra and the others and
explain to them their positions.

635
00:47:52,082 --> 00:47:54,915
Agaj, you come with
me and Kush, you...

636
00:48:00,658 --> 00:48:04,526
We will be fine. The time has come.

637
00:48:04,795 --> 00:48:08,993
We will show them that even we
know how to fulfill our duty.

638
00:48:09,099 --> 00:48:14,594
Even we can defend ourselves and
protect our Ashram. jai Guruji!

639
00:48:15,005 --> 00:48:17,200
jai Guriji! Long live Dharma!

640
00:48:17,274 --> 00:48:19,742
They are very close.
They will reach any moment.

641
00:48:34,992 --> 00:48:37,859
l am Ram's younger brother Lakshman..

642
00:48:38,329 --> 00:48:41,662
..and l have come to
avenge Ayodhya's insult.

643
00:48:42,599 --> 00:48:46,194
l don't want to be
responsible for meaningless bloodshed.

644
00:48:46,737 --> 00:48:50,104
lf you wish, we can choose
to find an amicable solution.

645
00:48:50,874 --> 00:48:53,069
l don't blame you for being scared.

646
00:48:54,244 --> 00:48:56,678
By the way, where is your brother?

647
00:48:59,249 --> 00:49:01,877
Looks like your army has deserted you!

648
00:49:04,655 --> 00:49:06,589
l suggest you come
with me to Ayodhya..

649
00:49:06,690 --> 00:49:08,248
..and apologize to King Ram.

650
00:49:08,325 --> 00:49:13,524
Apologize for what? They intruded
ourjungle and invited trouble.

651
00:49:13,597 --> 00:49:16,964
Neither can you change the
rules of the Ashwamedh nor can we.

652
00:49:17,234 --> 00:49:19,532
The prosperity of our
kingdom is at stake..

653
00:49:19,603 --> 00:49:21,764
..and l am ready to fight for it.

654
00:49:22,106 --> 00:49:23,698
That is my duty.

655
00:49:23,774 --> 00:49:27,301
Duty! Duty is not
about encroaching into..

656
00:49:27,378 --> 00:49:29,141
..other's
territories and their lives...

657
00:49:29,213 --> 00:49:30,339
Enough words!

658
00:49:30,881 --> 00:49:35,409
The Ashwamedh will be completed.
Surrender or die.

659
00:49:35,652 --> 00:49:37,085
You save yourself first.

660
00:49:59,777 --> 00:50:01,438
l don't believe it.

661
00:50:46,623 --> 00:50:47,715
Agaj!!!

662
00:50:55,332 --> 00:50:56,890
Tie him up and take him prisoner.

663
00:51:14,751 --> 00:51:19,313
Find the Ashwamedh horse. Hurry up.
We don't have the entire day.

664
00:51:19,389 --> 00:51:20,481
Yes, Prince.

665
00:51:28,565 --> 00:51:31,500
Hey! What was that? Be alert.

666
00:51:33,904 --> 00:51:35,064
Luv.

667
00:51:35,172 --> 00:51:36,264
Who is it?

668
00:51:37,274 --> 00:51:40,641
lt's me... Agaj...
l'm in the bushes behind you.

669
00:51:41,345 --> 00:51:45,611
Don't come out now. They will
return any moment. ls everyone okay?

670
00:51:45,682 --> 00:51:51,518
Yes. They have gone to get help
.Thank you for saving my life.

671
00:51:51,622 --> 00:51:53,351
lt was my duty, Agaj.

672
00:51:55,259 --> 00:51:58,092
Are you sure these rabbits
are not going to attack us!

673
00:52:04,301 --> 00:52:09,603
l... l want to confess, it was
me who lied and misguided Kush.

674
00:52:10,340 --> 00:52:14,538
l was blinded by revenge. l am sorry.

675
00:52:15,379 --> 00:52:21,750
l am sure you played your part,
but we made our mistakes too.

676
00:52:22,419 --> 00:52:26,014
l was so blinded by
my need to protect..

677
00:52:26,123 --> 00:52:30,492
..and control that l suffocated
my brother's individuality.

678
00:52:30,561 --> 00:52:32,927
l forgot that
l am incomplete without him.

679
00:52:33,363 --> 00:52:35,422
lf only l could get a second chance...

680
00:52:36,366 --> 00:52:38,766
l will find him. You don't worry.

681
00:52:38,835 --> 00:52:42,066
l'll bring him back, if that
is the last thing l ever do.

682
00:53:58,615 --> 00:54:04,212
Mother!! l will save you!
We will protect you! Luv!!

683
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:20,258
What place is this? Where am l?

684
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:19,958
Don't come forward! l am armed!

685
00:55:20,230 --> 00:55:24,326
Who are you? What are you? Did
you bring me here to eat me?

686
00:55:29,072 --> 00:55:34,100
l have no intentions to fight...
or to eat you.

687
00:55:34,578 --> 00:55:41,108
l am a Gandharva, the
protector of this Kalpa Vatika.

688
00:55:41,451 --> 00:55:46,753
l could not bring anyone
here even though l wished to.

689
00:55:47,057 --> 00:55:51,153
lt was your own destiny
that brought you here.

690
00:55:52,996 --> 00:55:54,896
Where are the other Gandharvas?

691
00:55:55,532 --> 00:56:01,095
There aren't any. We
are cursed to live alone.

692
00:56:01,371 --> 00:56:04,238
Oh! That is so sad!

693
00:56:04,975 --> 00:56:12,973
Yes. lt is not easy to live alone,
without a friend or a family.

694
00:56:13,517 --> 00:56:21,117
And to make things worse,
people think l am a monster!

695
00:56:21,958 --> 00:56:26,156
You don't know how lucky you are..

696
00:56:26,763 --> 00:56:34,169
..to have friends to play with,
a brother who loves you!

697
00:56:34,571 --> 00:56:36,198
Huh!! What difference does it make?

698
00:56:37,874 --> 00:56:40,206
That wound looks bad.

699
00:56:40,310 --> 00:56:44,337
No! l have seen worse!

700
00:56:45,882 --> 00:56:53,618
l can see that. Come closer.
Come. Give me your hand.

701
00:56:54,291 --> 00:56:58,421
But...but.. touching the
flower kills it! l don't want to...

702
00:56:58,528 --> 00:57:02,965
Trust me. Give me both your hands.

703
00:57:18,215 --> 00:57:23,050
Now, take a deep breath.

704
00:57:48,812 --> 00:57:50,803
Feeling better!?

705
00:57:51,081 --> 00:57:54,107
ln the name of Brahma!
How did this happen?

706
00:57:54,517 --> 00:57:56,985
l am completely healed. How?

707
00:57:57,254 --> 00:58:00,587
No, no, no... They will die...

708
00:58:01,625 --> 00:58:03,525
How is this possible?

709
00:58:03,593 --> 00:58:06,084
Why did it die when l
touched it the first time?

710
00:58:06,196 --> 00:58:09,097
Because they are one!

711
00:58:09,733 --> 00:58:14,193
Though on the surface they
are individual flowers..

712
00:58:14,271 --> 00:58:22,110
..deep down they share a
bond that connects them.

713
00:58:22,345 --> 00:58:28,750
That is why when you
plucked one, it's twin died too.

714
00:58:29,085 --> 00:58:32,282
They cannot survive
without each other.

715
00:58:32,389 --> 00:58:34,289
But as long as they are together...

716
00:58:34,391 --> 00:58:37,189
They can survive even if uprooted!

717
00:58:38,194 --> 00:58:43,860
And it is only when you
used both of them together..

718
00:58:43,934 --> 00:58:49,167
..could they unleash their
true gift of rejuvenation!

719
00:58:49,439 --> 00:58:55,469
This is the magic of the rare
Nuwali flowers that l protect!

720
00:58:55,545 --> 00:58:56,978
Nuwali?

721
00:58:58,381 --> 00:59:01,817
Be like the rare Nuwali flower!

722
00:59:02,185 --> 00:59:06,144
What have l done!! No!

723
00:59:06,456 --> 00:59:08,720
l have made a big mistake, Gandharva.

724
00:59:09,059 --> 00:59:11,789
l need to set things right.
My brother is in trouble.

725
00:59:11,861 --> 00:59:14,193
l need to get back to him.

726
00:59:14,264 --> 00:59:16,528
Please show me the
path back to my duty..

727
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:20,097
..back to my brother. Please!

728
00:59:20,870 --> 00:59:25,773
Why show you the way?
l will reach you there.

729
00:59:26,042 --> 00:59:27,907
Hold on tight!

730
01:00:02,979 --> 01:00:04,446
Oh God!

731
01:00:06,483 --> 01:00:08,007
Kush?

732
01:00:08,952 --> 01:00:10,044
Kush..

733
01:00:10,153 --> 01:00:11,552
You are alive..

734
01:00:12,822 --> 01:00:14,847
You rest. l will take care..

735
01:00:15,392 --> 01:00:17,223
His state looks very bad.

736
01:00:17,327 --> 01:00:21,457
Yes. And Lakshman
also looks very angry.

737
01:00:21,831 --> 01:00:25,323
Seems, he has sent out most of
the soldiers to look for the horse.

738
01:00:25,402 --> 01:00:29,839
Yes. This is our chance.
We must do something to rescue Luv.

739
01:00:30,140 --> 01:00:32,233
And something we will do!

740
01:00:33,376 --> 01:00:37,210
Kush! You are back! -Kush! Wow!

741
01:00:38,415 --> 01:00:40,406
l knew you would return.

742
01:00:41,718 --> 01:00:45,654
You have come at the right time,
Kush. Luv needs you!

743
01:00:47,424 --> 01:00:48,618
Any news about the horse?

744
01:00:48,725 --> 01:00:49,987
Not yet, Prince.

745
01:00:50,493 --> 01:00:53,291
Be alert. -Yes. -Keep a strict watch.

746
01:00:53,363 --> 01:00:55,923
l have a plan, but...

747
01:00:56,699 --> 01:00:58,997
...we need to create a diversion

748
01:01:01,037 --> 01:01:03,403
l will do it! l will go!

749
01:01:03,673 --> 01:01:06,938
Yeah right! You will
probably sell us all!

750
01:01:07,177 --> 01:01:10,340
Bheelu, l think we can
trust our friend Agaj.

751
01:01:11,681 --> 01:01:14,548
lf you trust him, we trust him!

752
01:01:19,322 --> 01:01:22,587
These kids... they have turned out..

753
01:01:22,692 --> 01:01:24,626
..to be more trouble
than l had expected!

754
01:01:25,395 --> 01:01:26,862
l said leave me!

755
01:01:26,930 --> 01:01:30,525
Your majesty, we found
this kid snooping around.

756
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:34,267
Prince Lakshman,
l have a proposition for you..

757
01:01:34,471 --> 01:01:38,168
..and l think you will
be very.. interested.

758
01:01:38,274 --> 01:01:39,400
Speak!

759
01:01:39,476 --> 01:01:40,773
Let's go!

760
01:01:41,244 --> 01:01:45,010
Quick Mangal, Sohan,
keep a watch on them.

761
01:01:46,983 --> 01:01:48,507
Lets get out of here quick,

762
01:01:51,421 --> 01:01:52,683
Keep talking.

763
01:01:54,224 --> 01:01:57,785
ls this how you
treat an ally in Ayodhya?

764
01:01:59,629 --> 01:02:05,329
Before l continue,
we must discuss.. my reward.

765
01:02:05,435 --> 01:02:07,733
So far l have spared you..

766
01:02:07,837 --> 01:02:13,605
..and the rest of those tiny rats.
Not yet!

767
01:02:22,952 --> 01:02:26,444
Kush! Quick, pick up your bow
and arrow...shoot!!

768
01:02:27,023 --> 01:02:30,015
Relax everyone. He is the Gandharva.

769
01:02:30,126 --> 01:02:32,526
Relax? Are you mad?

770
01:02:32,629 --> 01:02:33,755
Gandharva!!

771
01:02:33,830 --> 01:02:35,058
Yes.

772
01:02:35,131 --> 01:02:38,658
And he is with me. He is my friend.

773
01:02:38,735 --> 01:02:39,861
Friend?

774
01:03:13,570 --> 01:03:16,767
Kush.. -Luv is gaining consciousness!

775
01:03:18,241 --> 01:03:22,905
He is going to be fine!
Luv? Luv? Can you hear me?

776
01:03:23,513 --> 01:03:27,609
Kush! ls that... you?

777
01:03:27,884 --> 01:03:31,081
Yes! lt is me, my brother, l am back.

778
01:03:32,021 --> 01:03:36,117
l am so sorry, l made a big mistake...

779
01:03:38,795 --> 01:03:43,164
No...it was my fault.
l pushed you away.

780
01:03:43,666 --> 01:03:47,466
Quite now, just relax,
everything will be fine.

781
01:03:47,937 --> 01:03:49,199
We are together now,..

782
01:03:49,272 --> 01:03:53,333
..like the magical Nuwali flower,
And l met the Gandharva, Luv.

783
01:03:53,710 --> 01:03:54,870
l am telling the truth.

784
01:03:54,944 --> 01:04:00,678
l believe you, Kush and l..l..
tell me more about the Gandharva..

785
01:04:03,586 --> 01:04:07,454
How do l fix this,
brother? Give me a plan!

786
01:04:24,807 --> 01:04:26,206
Your tears?

787
01:04:26,676 --> 01:04:29,804
Yes, when l am moved..

788
01:04:30,179 --> 01:04:36,140
..l cry and my tears give birth
to the Nuwali flowers.

789
01:04:36,219 --> 01:04:37,709
Oh Gandharva!

790
01:04:39,956 --> 01:04:42,686
Now go, heal your brother.

791
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:48,722
Gandharva... when we met..
how did you know..

792
01:04:48,798 --> 01:04:50,425
..l had a brother?

793
01:04:51,534 --> 01:04:52,831
You see those?

794
01:04:53,202 --> 01:04:55,568
They only come in pairs.

795
01:05:03,880 --> 01:05:06,440
And... l need a black horse..

796
01:05:06,549 --> 01:05:08,449
..No, no.. May be
white horse will be fine..

797
01:05:08,518 --> 01:05:09,610
..and lots of food. And...

798
01:05:09,686 --> 01:05:13,087
Enough! You have wasted my time.

799
01:05:13,189 --> 01:05:15,680
Either you tell me
where to find the horse..

800
01:05:15,792 --> 01:05:18,056
..or else you and your friend..

801
01:05:38,314 --> 01:05:40,805
Let him go. lt's
those two that l want.

802
01:05:41,217 --> 01:05:42,411
On guard!

803
01:05:48,991 --> 01:05:51,721
Oh leader of the gods..

804
01:05:52,428 --> 01:05:54,555
May success come to my
efforts by your grace..

805
01:05:55,798 --> 01:06:01,065
May all the obstacles meet
their end! l am immortal,

806
01:06:01,304 --> 01:06:04,137
l am blissful.
l am Brahma The Creator.

807
01:06:04,207 --> 01:06:06,266
What are you waiting for you! Attack!!

808
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:25,725
Attack!

809
01:06:26,262 --> 01:06:28,696
Let's end this.

810
01:06:30,266 --> 01:06:32,291
Aham Brahmasmi..

811
01:06:46,282 --> 01:06:48,648
Oh my god! Run!

812
01:06:56,225 --> 01:06:57,692
No!

813
01:07:06,636 --> 01:07:10,663
Luv and Kush have done it!

814
01:07:15,077 --> 01:07:17,944
Perhaps now they will
respect us and our stand.

815
01:07:18,014 --> 01:07:19,777
Yes. Perhaps.

816
01:07:20,817 --> 01:07:24,150
Come on, friends, let's
help them out of the water!

817
01:07:25,388 --> 01:07:26,753
Aren't they the enemy?

818
01:07:26,856 --> 01:07:28,153
We proved our point.

819
01:07:28,391 --> 01:07:30,655
We had no intention of killing them.

820
01:07:54,817 --> 01:07:57,911
lt's King Ram. Ram has saved us!

821
01:07:59,222 --> 01:08:02,350
Take prince Lakshman
back to Ayodhya immediately.

822
01:08:07,430 --> 01:08:12,265
Who are you? Who are you to
commit such acts of contempt?

823
01:08:12,568 --> 01:08:15,264
We are the defenders
of our guru's ashram.

824
01:08:15,371 --> 01:08:16,770
And the defenders of Dharma.

825
01:08:18,307 --> 01:08:20,605
Those are very noble words, children.

826
01:08:21,344 --> 01:08:24,211
Your Guru and parents
have taught you well!

827
01:08:24,313 --> 01:08:25,371
Thank you.

828
01:08:25,481 --> 01:08:30,851
l admire your intentions, and
hence l shall pardon your mistakes.

829
01:08:31,821 --> 01:08:37,225
Now, release the horse, so that
we can return to Ayodhya in peace

830
01:08:37,493 --> 01:08:42,521
King Ram, we have always
respected you and your principles.

831
01:08:42,632 --> 01:08:45,567
But off late we have
realized you have not..

832
01:08:45,768 --> 01:08:47,668
..always made the right decisions.

833
01:08:47,870 --> 01:08:49,963
And by compromising our beliefs..

834
01:08:50,373 --> 01:08:53,399
..we will be making the same
mistakes that you have made.

835
01:08:53,509 --> 01:08:55,204
Don't be stubborn, children.

836
01:08:55,611 --> 01:08:57,602
There are larger things at stake here.

837
01:08:58,281 --> 01:09:00,772
You have already crossed many lines.

838
01:09:00,883 --> 01:09:03,317
Don't make me forget you are children.

839
01:09:03,386 --> 01:09:05,513
We will take our chances.

840
01:09:05,621 --> 01:09:10,456
The world will know how Luv-Kush
fought with the great warrior Ram,

841
01:09:15,431 --> 01:09:19,333
Our respect for you doesn't mean
we will stop protecting our ashram..

842
01:09:19,435 --> 01:09:20,732
..and our rights.

843
01:09:20,970 --> 01:09:23,131
You leave me no choice.

844
01:10:47,990 --> 01:10:49,150
Guru Valmiki!

845
01:10:55,498 --> 01:10:56,590
How come you...?

846
01:10:56,699 --> 01:11:00,226
You were about to
make a grave mistake.

847
01:11:00,970 --> 01:11:04,633
King, these are my pupils,
Luv and Kush.

848
01:11:05,107 --> 01:11:09,942
They were only standing up for
what they have been taught to be true.

849
01:11:10,046 --> 01:11:11,741
l understand, guruji.

850
01:11:12,214 --> 01:11:16,776
A rare and admirable quality, to
be expected.. only from your pupils!

851
01:11:17,286 --> 01:11:20,983
And also, from the Sons of Ram!

852
01:11:21,357 --> 01:11:22,483
What!!?

853
01:11:22,591 --> 01:11:27,961
Yes.. my dear children.
Meet Ramayana's Ram, your father!

854
01:11:28,030 --> 01:11:33,593
And your mother Vandevi, is
none other than the Queen Sita!

855
01:11:33,703 --> 01:11:35,193
But...but ...

856
01:11:35,638 --> 01:11:40,405
Sita was carrying your sons in
her womb when she left Ayodhya.

857
01:11:40,843 --> 01:11:42,435
l found her that..

858
01:11:42,511 --> 01:11:44,240
..fateful night in these forests..

859
01:11:44,814 --> 01:11:48,614
Luv and Kush were born in my ashram.

860
01:11:48,684 --> 01:11:54,850
Raised to be kings, to be
exemplary human beings..

861
01:11:55,157 --> 01:12:01,255
..and destined for
greatness like their parents!

862
01:12:02,198 --> 01:12:03,665
My children!

863
01:12:04,066 --> 01:12:05,590
Father.. Father!

864
01:12:10,840 --> 01:12:12,569
The great Lord Ram...

865
01:12:12,675 --> 01:12:15,303
Our Luv-Kush's father!!!

866
01:12:17,046 --> 01:12:23,007
We have always loved and admired
you King Ram, l mean.. Father!

867
01:12:23,085 --> 01:12:26,577
But.. but.. we have so
many questions! -Yes.

868
01:12:26,856 --> 01:12:30,690
Why did you let mother go?
How could you remarry?

869
01:12:31,093 --> 01:12:35,154
Did you not love her?
Did you not want us?!

870
01:12:35,264 --> 01:12:41,169
No! No, no, my children. None of
that is true... None of that..

871
01:12:41,237 --> 01:12:45,970
Children. You must
understand this was ...

872
01:12:46,041 --> 01:12:48,737
...a very difficult
decision for your father.

873
01:12:48,978 --> 01:12:51,640
He loved Sita very much.

874
01:12:52,114 --> 01:12:57,484
But after depriving Ayodhya of
its rightful king for 14 years..

875
01:12:57,553 --> 01:13:00,989
..his heart could no longer
deny his subjects anything.

876
01:13:01,056 --> 01:13:04,617
He sacrificed his own happiness.

877
01:13:04,894 --> 01:13:09,194
ln fact he sacrificed his love too.

878
01:13:09,298 --> 01:13:12,028
But their questions are
not inappropriate, guruji.

879
01:13:12,401 --> 01:13:17,998
l have not been fair
to them, or to Sita.

880
01:13:18,407 --> 01:13:19,965
l owe them an apology.

881
01:13:20,242 --> 01:13:22,369
No you don't!

882
01:13:24,613 --> 01:13:29,016
Oh Sita!

883
01:13:35,491 --> 01:13:39,928
l.. did not.. remarry..

884
01:13:40,462 --> 01:13:45,422
l understand everything
you did and the reason.

885
01:13:45,935 --> 01:13:50,872
l do not blame you. l have
always respected and loved you.

886
01:13:51,674 --> 01:13:53,574
And will continue you to do so.

887
01:13:55,211 --> 01:13:56,371
Mother!

888
01:14:04,620 --> 01:14:08,579
Guruji always said this
day would come, and it has.

889
01:14:09,091 --> 01:14:11,184
My dreams have come true.

890
01:14:12,228 --> 01:14:15,425
My sons have their loving father..

891
01:14:16,332 --> 01:14:19,301
..my husband has got his family.

892
01:14:19,935 --> 01:14:23,769
And Ayodhya will discover
its good fortune once again!

893
01:14:24,940 --> 01:14:29,206
Thank you, guruji. l
could not be happier.

894
01:14:29,278 --> 01:14:33,806
All is told...when destinies unfold.

895
01:14:33,883 --> 01:14:35,407
l am free now.

896
01:14:35,484 --> 01:14:36,644
Free?

897
01:14:36,752 --> 01:14:39,050
Remember what l told you both?

898
01:14:39,321 --> 01:14:43,223
Maybe, you knew this day was coming.

899
01:14:48,564 --> 01:14:52,591
Mother..

900
01:14:55,337 --> 01:14:58,329
Yes! Yes! But we knew
we could protect you...

901
01:14:58,440 --> 01:14:59,873
We know what we have to do.

902
01:14:59,975 --> 01:15:02,273
We will do whatever it takes
to prevent it from happening!

903
01:15:02,344 --> 01:15:08,010
Or.. perhaps... make it happen?!

904
01:15:08,384 --> 01:15:13,185
Children, it is because
of you l get to be free.

905
01:15:13,622 --> 01:15:17,558
Your decisions have made it possible
for all my dreams to come true.

906
01:15:19,128 --> 01:15:23,531
lt is time to set your
mother free... won't you?

907
01:15:47,222 --> 01:15:50,623
These children have
wisdom beyond their years.

908
01:15:51,293 --> 01:15:52,419
Sita...

909
01:16:14,683 --> 01:16:15,980
Oh Mother Earth.

910
01:16:16,585 --> 01:16:18,815
lf you are proud of this daughter..

911
01:16:19,054 --> 01:16:21,352
..if l have done my duties...

912
01:16:22,024 --> 01:16:24,049
..please open your arms and
take me into your embrace.

913
01:16:24,827 --> 01:16:29,457
l give myself back to you!

914
01:17:07,102 --> 01:17:12,802
l don't have to tolerate any longer.

915
01:17:12,908 --> 01:17:17,845
We don't have to fear.

916
01:17:17,946 --> 01:17:25,443
Now l.. l go far.. far.

917
01:17:35,931 --> 01:17:43,633
Finally you're free.. far away..

918
01:17:45,908 --> 01:17:54,509
Far away.. but you will be near us.

919
01:18:18,073 --> 01:18:25,502
Oh Ram, this is a new beginning.
A new life.

920
01:18:26,014 --> 01:18:33,614
Oh Ram, beautiful
dreams call out to you.

921
01:18:42,531 --> 01:18:47,833
Luv and Kush are your identities.

922
01:18:47,936 --> 01:18:53,374
They have brought luck,
again the Kingdom will shine.

923
01:18:56,645 --> 01:19:01,548
Lord Ram made a statue of Sita.

924
01:19:01,650 --> 01:19:07,486
Everyone saw it and
understood the saga of their love.

925
01:19:26,542 --> 01:19:34,142
To save the Kingdom, the
young princes did the Yagna.

926
01:19:34,550 --> 01:19:37,280
The difficulties passed away,..

927
01:19:37,352 --> 01:19:42,619
..and Ayodhya was
filled with happiness.

928
01:20:09,685 --> 01:20:11,277
Luv! Kush!

929
01:20:11,620 --> 01:20:13,815
See who has come.

930
01:20:16,758 --> 01:20:18,487
Sohan, Bheelu!

931
01:20:18,994 --> 01:20:21,519
Feeling so happy seeing them.

932
01:20:40,749 --> 01:20:42,876
No more sleepless nights.

933
01:20:42,951 --> 01:20:45,351
No more nightmares.

934
01:20:45,587 --> 01:20:49,079
Only fun and
adventure with Gandharva.

935
01:20:49,157 --> 01:20:50,215
We are all friends.

936
01:20:50,325 --> 01:20:56,355
Together, we will have fun! Fun!

937
01:20:58,767 --> 01:21:02,965
Ayodhya, Ayodhya, we
have come to Ayodhya.

938
01:21:03,038 --> 01:21:07,304
Ayodhya, this is now our house.

939
01:21:07,376 --> 01:21:09,571
The box of happiness has opened.

940
01:21:09,645 --> 01:21:11,670
Our stars are shinning.

941
01:21:11,747 --> 01:21:14,113
The happiness is spreading.

942
01:21:14,182 --> 01:21:18,084
Now Ayodhya is bright again.

943
01:21:18,186 --> 01:21:20,848
l must say, those
bracelets look really special.

944
01:21:20,956 --> 01:21:22,287
What is their secret?

945
01:21:22,691 --> 01:21:23,783
The same as..

946
01:21:23,892 --> 01:21:25,018
Nuwali flower!

947
01:21:25,127 --> 01:21:26,924
Nuwali flower? What is that?

948
01:21:28,397 --> 01:21:32,663
Ayodhya, Ayodhya, is magical.

949
01:21:32,768 --> 01:21:37,034
Ayodhya, Ayodhya, is wonderful.

950
01:21:37,105 --> 01:21:41,371
Ayodhya, Ayodhya, is splendid.

951
01:21:41,443 --> 01:21:47,245
Ayodhya, Ayodhya, hail to it.

952
01:22:01,263 --> 01:22:05,597
We hide in the fields. We
hide behind the mountains.

953
01:22:05,701 --> 01:22:07,259
We hide behind the trees. ..

954
01:22:07,336 --> 01:22:11,466
..We bathe under waterfalls.
We race boats in the river.

955
01:22:11,540 --> 01:22:13,508
We fly kites.

956
01:22:13,608 --> 01:22:18,238
We break fruits with stones.
And then eat them and become fat.

957
01:22:18,547 --> 01:22:22,608
We play together and have fun.

958
01:22:22,684 --> 01:22:26,381
When we two meet.

959
01:22:26,655 --> 01:22:29,283
You are my loving
brother and best friend.

960
01:22:29,391 --> 01:22:31,450
My partner in sorrow and happiness.

961
01:22:31,560 --> 01:22:33,687
Mild fights in friendship.

962
01:22:33,795 --> 01:22:35,763
We have stayed awake
for so many nights.

963
01:22:35,864 --> 01:22:37,855
We played hide and
seek and other games.

964
01:22:37,933 --> 01:22:40,197
We fight for clothes.

965
01:22:40,569 --> 01:22:43,299
l am your loving
brother and best friend.

966
01:22:43,372 --> 01:22:47,206
You will always be my partner.

967
01:22:55,917 --> 01:23:00,513
He will not squeal on me.
He will save me from a scolding.

968
01:23:00,589 --> 01:23:02,887
He laughs when l fall and get hurt.

969
01:23:02,991 --> 01:23:04,925
So that l forget my pain.

970
01:23:05,026 --> 01:23:07,017
This mischief keeps going on.

971
01:23:07,129 --> 01:23:09,097
And this giggling like crazy people.

972
01:23:09,197 --> 01:23:11,324
lf l steal his sweet.

973
01:23:11,433 --> 01:23:13,526
There will be one more fight.

974
01:23:13,602 --> 01:23:17,868
We play, and have fun like this.

975
01:23:17,939 --> 01:23:21,670
When we two partners meet.

976
01:23:30,285 --> 01:23:31,377
Oh my gosh.

977
01:23:31,453 --> 01:23:35,082
These brothers fight so much.
But l side them.

978
01:23:35,157 --> 01:23:37,284
They don't listen, act ignorant.

979
01:23:37,359 --> 01:23:39,452
Forget peace. Work is still pending.

980
01:23:39,561 --> 01:23:42,553
Children, like good boys..

981
01:23:42,631 --> 01:23:46,590
..why don't you stay decently?

982
01:23:47,969 --> 01:23:55,205
To tell you the truth after
making me cry, they keep tickling me.

983
01:23:56,178 --> 01:23:59,739
Oh my gosh, these brothers,
they bring happiness.

984
01:23:59,815 --> 01:24:01,476
But l love my sons.

985
01:24:11,993 --> 01:24:15,520
They act like fools
and make a fool of you.

986
01:24:16,298 --> 01:24:19,790
Next moment they become sensible.

987
01:24:20,702 --> 01:24:24,297
Our team is strong, remember that.

988
01:24:24,840 --> 01:24:28,332
Dreams are also splendid,
remember that.

989
01:24:28,777 --> 01:24:31,007
Our team work is good.

990
01:24:31,112 --> 01:24:33,239
Nobody come between us.

991
01:24:33,315 --> 01:24:35,442
l know your mind.

992
01:24:35,517 --> 01:24:37,712
You know my mind.

993
01:24:37,786 --> 01:24:39,845
l am better than you.

994
01:24:39,955 --> 01:24:41,889
But l am greater than you.

995
01:24:41,957 --> 01:24:44,152
You are a kid near me.

996
01:24:44,259 --> 01:24:46,284
Go and check yourself out.

997
01:24:46,628 --> 01:24:50,496
We play, and have fun like this.

998
01:24:50,932 --> 01:24:54,561
When we two partners meet.

999
01:24:54,636 --> 01:24:57,503
You are my loving
brother and best friend.

1000
01:24:57,572 --> 01:24:59,563
My partner in sorrow and happiness.

1001
01:24:59,641 --> 01:25:01,802
Mild fights in friendship.

1002
01:25:01,910 --> 01:25:03,878
We have stayed awake
for so many nights.

1003
01:25:03,979 --> 01:25:06,038
We played hide and
seek and other games.

1004
01:25:06,114 --> 01:25:08,446
We fight for clothes.

1005
01:25:08,783 --> 01:25:11,479
l am your loving
brother and best friend.

1006
01:25:11,586 --> 01:25:15,215
You will always be my partner.
