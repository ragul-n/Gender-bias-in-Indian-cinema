00:00:34,854 --> 00:00:37,178
- Hello?
- A plane is about to land on the Delhi base.

4
00:00:37,425 --> 00:00:39,225
It might be an international
smuggler's plane.

5
00:00:42,519 --> 00:00:43,946
Hello? Yes. Yes.

6
00:00:44,026 --> 00:00:45,996
Let's go, everyone. Hurry up!
Let's go.

7
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:50,416
Let's go.

8
00:00:58,097 --> 00:00:59,097
Look at that.

9
00:01:14,087 --> 00:01:15,308
Let's go.

10
00:02:52,754 --> 00:02:54,781
Move that way. Hurry!

11
00:03:56,792 --> 00:03:59,670
Hello! Hello, Delhi Headquarters.

12
00:04:00,927 --> 00:04:04,086
Hello, Delhi Headquarters.
I tried very hard..

13
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:05,926
But they managed to
escape with the truck.

14
00:07:09,043 --> 00:07:11,719
They aren't just smugglers,
they are enemies of our nation.

15
00:07:11,799 --> 00:07:13,624
We have to arrest them at any cost.

16
00:07:13,704 --> 00:07:16,935
I can even lay my life to catch
them and sacrifice anything.

17
00:07:18,137 --> 00:07:20,327
Rs 50,000/-
- Rs 50,000/-

18
00:07:20,407 --> 00:07:22,164
- Rs 50,000?
- Yes.

19
00:07:22,244 --> 00:07:24,759
If anyone arrests the smuggler
who ran from Agra road..

20
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:26,410
The government has announced
Rs 50,000 as a prize.

21
00:07:26,434 --> 00:07:28,327
And we are the best
detectives in this country.

22
00:07:28,407 --> 00:07:32,503
If one of us doesn't
catch hold of him..

23
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:36,165
Then we should be
ashamed of ourselves.

24
00:07:36,921 --> 00:07:39,623
He will surely comes to
Delhi and stay in a hotel..

25
00:07:39,703 --> 00:07:41,367
Where international groups reside.

26
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:44,853
Hence, we have to monitor
all the big hotels in Delhi closely.

27
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:47,502
But how do you think he looks?

28
00:07:47,582 --> 00:07:50,367
His look has been described
in the newspaper.

29
00:07:50,447 --> 00:07:53,326
He is wearing a green
suit and has a briefcase.

30
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:55,475
Correct. This case is good for us.

31
00:07:55,555 --> 00:07:57,394
- C'mon, get up.
- Get up.

32
00:07:57,474 --> 00:07:58,812
- Wait!
- Wait.

33
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:01,569
Wait! I am your elder brother.

34
00:08:02,124 --> 00:08:05,111
Whatever I say, will be sensible.

35
00:08:06,097 --> 00:08:09,489
Give me a big binoculars and
help me stand on Qutub Minar.

36
00:08:09,773 --> 00:08:11,503
I will keep an eye from there.

37
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:13,570
The moment I see the smuggler..

38
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:16,814
I will signal all of you and
then you can catch him.

39
00:08:33,921 --> 00:08:35,273
- Oh!
- Oh! I am sorry.

40
00:08:36,597 --> 00:08:37,867
Thank you.

41
00:08:55,138 --> 00:08:57,544
Excuse me, have you
seen the city the Agra?

42
00:08:58,193 --> 00:09:00,084
- I have.
- Very good.

43
00:09:00,517 --> 00:09:01,990
How did you like Taj Mahal?

44
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:04,030
Just like the dream of an emperor.

45
00:09:05,274 --> 00:09:08,490
Do only emperors see
such beautiful dreams?

46
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,813
That depends on each person.

47
00:09:12,543 --> 00:09:15,759
Whenever I come to India,
I see the Taj Mahal for sure.

48
00:09:17,584 --> 00:09:19,678
- From where have you come?
- Paris.

49
00:09:19,921 --> 00:09:21,894
- Oh!
- I have my business there.

50
00:09:24,489 --> 00:09:27,408
Even then I have to come to
India once or twice in a year.

51
00:09:27,718 --> 00:09:30,489
Excuse me, sir,
I have to check you.

52
00:09:37,394 --> 00:09:39,634
Have you heard about this
perfume named 'Paris By Night'?

53
00:09:40,461 --> 00:09:42,178
You mean, 'An Evening In Paris'?

54
00:09:42,258 --> 00:09:43,732
That is a very old perfume.

55
00:09:43,961 --> 00:09:45,826
This is the latest
perfume from Paris.

56
00:09:47,029 --> 00:09:50,205
'Paris By Night'.
The name is beautiful.

57
00:09:50,867 --> 00:09:52,922
Isn't it available in India yet?

58
00:09:53,017 --> 00:09:55,151
Not yet but I am the one
getting it to India.

59
00:09:55,231 --> 00:09:57,559
On a journey, one must be accompanied
by nature, a girl and a perfume.

60
00:09:57,583 --> 00:09:58,813
- Take it.
- No, thanks.

61
00:09:58,893 --> 00:10:01,042
When I go to Paris,
I can buy one more. Please.

62
00:10:01,259 --> 00:10:03,137
- I don't take gifts.
- Please! Please take it.

63
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:05,015
No. Please!

64
00:10:06,353 --> 00:10:08,880
Excuse me, sir.
I need to check you.

65
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,056
- Checking? What for?
- Yes.

66
00:10:11,136 --> 00:10:13,083
That's non of your business.
I am on duty.

67
00:10:13,163 --> 00:10:15,502
- Right. Please go ahead.
- Alright.

68
00:10:18,947 --> 00:10:20,785
- That's my wallet.
- That's alright.

69
00:10:25,042 --> 00:10:26,529
These poor policemen
are so helpless.

70
00:10:26,609 --> 00:10:30,380
Nowadays, goons and decent
people look alike. Right?

71
00:10:35,799 --> 00:10:37,217
Where can I meet you in Delhi?

72
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:40,055
Why do you want to
meet me in Delhi?

73
00:10:40,907 --> 00:10:43,731
Now that we have met in Agra
then why not in Delhi as well?

74
00:10:44,366 --> 00:10:46,204
Both are romantic places.

75
00:10:46,596 --> 00:10:49,420
So, you want to romance with me!

76
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,757
Well, that's what I feel.

77
00:10:51,973 --> 00:10:53,514
We'll see once we reach Delhi.

78
00:10:53,973 --> 00:10:56,014
So sure of yourself!

79
00:10:56,595 --> 00:10:58,676
Of course. Very very sure.

80
00:10:59,027 --> 00:11:00,662
We'll see.

81
00:11:09,973 --> 00:11:13,351
Hurry up, darling. Do make both
the garlands beautifully.

82
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:17,527
What happened?
You aren't drunk today!

83
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:20,121
You know that today is Tuesday.

84
00:11:20,201 --> 00:11:23,648
Neither did my dad or did my
grandpa drink on Tuesdays.

85
00:11:23,865 --> 00:11:26,460
That's why even I don't
drink on Tuesdays.

86
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:28,716
Moreover, today's
Tuesday is very lucky.

87
00:11:28,796 --> 00:11:32,256
The thing is that my the immediate
owner of the hotel I work in..

88
00:11:32,336 --> 00:11:33,496
And Helen are coming.

89
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:36,959
I just want to welcome
them with these garlands..

90
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:39,796
And that would open the
doors of my destiny.

91
00:11:39,876 --> 00:11:41,945
I have just two wishes.

92
00:11:42,174 --> 00:11:46,728
First one is of becoming the manager
of the hotel I am a waiter in.

93
00:11:46,808 --> 00:11:51,702
If I don't succeed in slaying then
at least become an Asst. Manager.

94
00:11:51,918 --> 00:11:53,620
And my wish number 2..

95
00:11:53,864 --> 00:11:56,972
- Is to get married to you.
- Get married to you?

96
00:11:57,215 --> 00:12:00,539
- Instead of getting married to a drunkard like you, I would...
- Oh!

97
00:12:01,148 --> 00:12:04,675
You are under the impression
that I drink alcohol myself.

98
00:12:04,755 --> 00:12:07,391
Actually, my grandpa was
a hardcore drunkard.

99
00:12:07,471 --> 00:12:09,864
It is his intoxication that
is spoiling my record.

100
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,851
My family members tell
me that when I was born..

101
00:12:12,931 --> 00:12:15,824
I did not open my eyes for 15
days because of the intoxication.

102
00:12:15,904 --> 00:12:19,594
While today the situation is that
after getting drunk I can stand..

103
00:12:19,823 --> 00:12:22,553
And tell who is drunk
to what extent.

104
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:26,891
Just the way, I can tell you that
right now you don't have any money.

105
00:12:27,094 --> 00:12:29,188
And you want to take
these garlands for free.

106
00:12:29,268 --> 00:12:32,688
Wow! I think even you have
someone's effect on you.

107
00:12:32,768 --> 00:12:36,229
Honestly speaking, our pair
will be one of its kinds.

108
00:12:36,309 --> 00:12:39,526
And our children will be such that
the world will be astonished.

109
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:41,567
Take your garlands and leave.

110
00:12:41,647 --> 00:12:43,837
Right. I will take your leave now.

111
00:12:43,917 --> 00:12:45,540
But I will come and
meet you again later.

112
00:12:53,337 --> 00:12:54,972
Take a look. Someone is coming.

113
00:12:56,013 --> 00:12:57,447
- Hey, that's a girl.
- Yes, she is a girl.

114
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:59,391
We need someone who
has a black bag.

115
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,189
Welcome! Welcome!

116
00:13:03,473 --> 00:13:05,473
Why do you always have to
welcome me with garlands?

117
00:13:05,567 --> 00:13:08,797
Initially, I used to do without any
reason but today I have a reason.

118
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:12,703
The reason is that I wish to
work night shift permanently.

119
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:15,987
You are strange guy.
People don't like night shifts..

120
00:13:16,176 --> 00:13:17,529
And you want to do night shifts.

121
00:13:17,553 --> 00:13:18,768
There is a reason behind that.

122
00:13:18,848 --> 00:13:21,433
The reason is that I don't
get sleep at night.

123
00:13:21,611 --> 00:13:26,028
So, after trying a lot when
I met a physician, I found out..

124
00:13:26,311 --> 00:13:28,717
That I have fallen in love.

125
00:13:28,797 --> 00:13:30,609
And this disease
doesn't have a cure.

126
00:13:30,689 --> 00:13:34,893
And importantly, I am sorry but
you are responsible for it.

127
00:13:34,973 --> 00:13:36,879
- Me?
- Don't worry.

128
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:39,339
The thing is that...
How it all began is that..

129
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:43,312
Whenever you come,
I present a garland to you.

130
00:13:43,392 --> 00:13:46,825
Hence, I have been to her shop to
get the garlands so many times..

131
00:13:46,905 --> 00:13:48,609
And bought so many garlands..

132
00:13:48,689 --> 00:13:51,785
That both of us fell in
love with each other.

133
00:13:51,865 --> 00:13:53,487
Moreover, she is very happy with you.

134
00:13:53,567 --> 00:13:58,298
She knows that until you want,
I cannot get married to her.

135
00:13:58,378 --> 00:14:00,042
But what can I do
for your marriage?

136
00:14:00,704 --> 00:14:01,812
You didn't get it.

137
00:14:01,892 --> 00:14:04,906
How can I get married
with such a low salary?

138
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:09,205
Yes, if I get promoted
then it is quite possible.

139
00:14:09,285 --> 00:14:11,340
I mean, may be not a manager.

140
00:14:11,569 --> 00:14:13,921
But at least give me a
chance as an Asst Manager.

141
00:14:15,651 --> 00:14:17,191
- Who is that coming?
- Where?

142
00:14:17,271 --> 00:14:18,597
- Found him.
- Follow him.

143
00:14:18,677 --> 00:14:20,151
- Yes, brother.
- Yes, brother.

144
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:22,299
What a timing!

145
00:14:22,488 --> 00:14:23,813
- What's this?
- A garland.

146
00:14:23,893 --> 00:14:25,988
This garland needed you.

147
00:14:26,068 --> 00:14:29,637
- What do you mean?
- I mean, you are a very handsome person.

148
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,772
And looking at your face
I can tell you that..

149
00:14:33,002 --> 00:14:35,529
You are coming from a
very beautiful place.

150
00:14:35,609 --> 00:14:37,151
Are you the astrologer
of this hotel?

151
00:14:37,231 --> 00:14:39,232
I am not an astrologer
but a waiter here.

152
00:14:39,312 --> 00:14:41,718
My name is Jani. I am friends
with friendly people.

153
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:43,718
And your wish is my command.

154
00:14:43,798 --> 00:14:45,299
Please come. Come.

155
00:14:49,773 --> 00:14:51,989
This is Delhi's most
beautiful hotel..

156
00:14:52,069 --> 00:14:54,570
And this is the most beautiful
room of this hotel.

157
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:56,165
That I realised in
the train itself.

158
00:14:56,245 --> 00:14:58,205
- How come in the train?
- Because of that girl.

159
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:02,082
She came to Delhi with me and
came to this hotel sometime ago.

160
00:15:02,162 --> 00:15:04,028
- Sometime ago in this hotel!
- Yes.

161
00:15:04,108 --> 00:15:06,069
- Are you coming from Agra?
- Yes, why?

162
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:08,285
That is great!

163
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:11,163
That means you can
get my boss fired.

164
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:13,163
Hey, what are you talking about?

165
00:15:13,392 --> 00:15:15,472
- What nonsense are you talking?
- I have understood.

166
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:19,014
You met my immediate boss, Helen.

167
00:15:19,312 --> 00:15:21,474
You came here following her.

168
00:15:21,554 --> 00:15:24,082
I mean you are following her..

169
00:15:24,352 --> 00:15:27,042
And she is being followed
by another loser.

170
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:30,677
And he is the one who has kept me..

171
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,717
As the assistant to the
Asst. Manager since 17 years.

172
00:15:34,068 --> 00:15:36,311
Please try to win over Helen..

173
00:15:36,527 --> 00:15:41,068
And make sure that the loser
boss is fired and gone forever.

174
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:46,878
In doing this, if you need my help,
remember this number.

175
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:48,797
Give me Helen's room number.

176
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,567
The room number... The room
number is in your hand.

177
00:15:53,567 --> 00:15:55,458
- 69?
- Yes, 69.

178
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:57,053
That's amazing, sir.

179
00:15:57,133 --> 00:15:58,796
You are holding such
an amazing number.

180
00:15:59,052 --> 00:16:02,728
Its 69 if upside down and
69 is kept straight.

181
00:16:05,931 --> 00:16:07,174
It is opened, sir.

182
00:16:28,877 --> 00:16:29,877
Hi!

183
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:33,174
I wanted to present
these diamonds to you.

184
00:16:33,647 --> 00:16:35,201
The police gave me
the chance to do it.

185
00:16:35,281 --> 00:16:36,498
Very smart!

186
00:16:38,336 --> 00:16:41,241
I cannot believe in
anything you say.

187
00:16:41,701 --> 00:16:43,647
That's what happens
with me all the time.

188
00:16:44,187 --> 00:16:46,768
Initially, no girl
believes in what I say.

189
00:16:47,106 --> 00:16:49,484
By the end, I win over all of them.

190
00:16:50,295 --> 00:16:51,863
Such confidence in yourself!

191
00:16:52,106 --> 00:16:55,092
Yes. I can win hearts only when
I have confidence in myself.

192
00:16:55,903 --> 00:16:57,998
How many hearts have
you won until now?

193
00:16:58,078 --> 00:17:00,160
I don't really remember.

194
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:03,227
Right now, I am just
concerned about you.

195
00:17:04,281 --> 00:17:08,335
Glasses break in to pieces when
they are banged against a stone.

196
00:17:08,753 --> 00:17:11,605
Your blue eyes have been
telling me something.

197
00:17:12,133 --> 00:17:14,781
Your heart is not
as strong as stone. Am I wrong?

198
00:17:16,944 --> 00:17:19,201
Don't think so much.
Listen to your heart.

199
00:18:23,528 --> 00:18:29,555
"Your thin waistline,
your sharp eyes.."

200
00:18:29,798 --> 00:18:32,771
"Your curvaceous neck."

201
00:18:32,851 --> 00:18:37,635
"O darling! You are such a beauty."

202
00:18:37,715 --> 00:18:43,852
"Your thin waistline,
your sharp eyes.."

203
00:18:44,042 --> 00:18:47,028
"Your curvaceous neck."

204
00:18:47,108 --> 00:18:51,771
"O darling! You are such a beauty."

205
00:18:51,851 --> 00:18:57,744
"Your black tresses are
like the beautiful clouds.."

206
00:18:58,163 --> 00:19:01,244
"That move like the monsoons."

207
00:19:01,433 --> 00:19:06,068
"O darling! You are such a beauty."

208
00:19:06,148 --> 00:19:09,743
"Your thin waistline..."

209
00:19:39,999 --> 00:19:43,297
"Your body is so silky.."

210
00:19:43,377 --> 00:19:46,053
"That even my eyes slip."

211
00:19:46,133 --> 00:19:52,715
"My hearts skips a beat
everytime your arms shine."

212
00:19:55,579 --> 00:20:01,850
"The land dances and kisses your
feet with such youthful vigour."

213
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:08,215
"Now you tell in such a case,
how can I not like you?"

214
00:20:08,295 --> 00:20:14,241
"Sometime come close to me and.."

215
00:20:14,498 --> 00:20:17,646
"listen to my heartbeats."

216
00:20:17,726 --> 00:20:22,255
"O darling! You are such a beauty."

217
00:20:22,461 --> 00:20:28,673
"Your thin waistline,
your sharp eyes.."

218
00:20:28,753 --> 00:20:31,728
"Your curvaceous neck."

219
00:20:31,917 --> 00:20:36,457
"O darling! You are such a beauty."

220
00:20:36,537 --> 00:20:39,281
"Your thin waistline..."

221
00:21:07,347 --> 00:21:10,564
"The one who notices you.."

222
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:13,631
"Will breathe a sigh."

223
00:21:13,711 --> 00:21:20,361
"If you gesture at someone,
he won't be in peace forever."

224
00:21:23,077 --> 00:21:29,172
"O darling, you will never
have any complains on me."

225
00:21:29,401 --> 00:21:35,563
"Even if I lose everything, my
heart will only take your name."

226
00:21:35,643 --> 00:21:41,806
"I will never leave.."

227
00:21:41,886 --> 00:21:44,900
"My loyalty towards you."

228
00:21:45,144 --> 00:21:49,752
"O darling! You are such a beauty."

229
00:21:49,832 --> 00:21:55,954
"Your thin waistline,
your sharp eyes.."

230
00:21:56,158 --> 00:21:59,076
"Your curvaceous neck."

231
00:21:59,156 --> 00:22:03,968
"O darling! You are such a beauty."

232
00:22:04,238 --> 00:22:09,738
"Your black tresses are
like the beautiful clouds.."

233
00:22:10,279 --> 00:22:13,279
"That move like the monsoons."

234
00:22:13,468 --> 00:22:18,360
"O darling! You are such a beauty."

235
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:46,022
How dare you call him to your room?

236
00:23:46,102 --> 00:23:47,955
I did not call him.
He came there himself.

237
00:23:48,266 --> 00:23:51,725
To be safe from the police, he gifted
me the perfume bottle in the train.

238
00:23:52,522 --> 00:23:55,698
There were diamonds in it.
I didn't even know.

239
00:23:56,184 --> 00:23:58,536
You were there when the
police checked him.

240
00:23:58,806 --> 00:24:02,238
But they found nothing.
He is a very brave man.

241
00:24:02,455 --> 00:24:05,076
- He is smart as well.
- I will mess all his smartness.

242
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:12,185
Finally, you have been caught.

243
00:24:13,698 --> 00:24:16,739
Do you think your
henchmen have caught me?

244
00:24:19,685 --> 00:24:21,118
I came here all by myself..

245
00:24:21,198 --> 00:24:22,807
To see who you are.

246
00:24:22,887 --> 00:24:25,280
- Mister?
- What mister? Say Mr. Robby.

247
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,645
Mr. Robby!

248
00:24:26,725 --> 00:24:28,658
You cannot leave from here.

249
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:31,551
You tried to come close
to our Miss Helen.

250
00:24:31,795 --> 00:24:33,835
- You will be punished for that.
- Punished?

251
00:24:35,741 --> 00:24:39,295
When the police couldn't punish me,
how can you punish me?

252
00:24:39,375 --> 00:24:41,010
- Robby!
- Mr. Robby!

253
00:24:41,727 --> 00:24:44,145
Some of our men did not
behave properly with you.

254
00:24:44,225 --> 00:24:45,862
We are really sorry for that.

255
00:24:46,132 --> 00:24:48,673
- That's what I wanted to say.
- Mr. Robby.

256
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:50,943
We have witnessed your bravery.

257
00:24:51,186 --> 00:24:53,956
You are capable to work for us.

258
00:24:54,619 --> 00:24:56,997
Yes. But you are capable
to make me work for you.

259
00:24:57,253 --> 00:25:00,456
Robby, this will lead to
a bad result for you.

260
00:25:00,536 --> 00:25:01,848
Then go to hell.

261
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:05,902
Wait. I will try to reason with him.

262
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:15,092
Robby! Robby, you don't know them.

263
00:25:15,538 --> 00:25:17,956
- They are very cruel.
- So what?

264
00:25:18,362 --> 00:25:19,592
I am not bothered about it.

265
00:25:19,672 --> 00:25:21,781
They don't think before
killing someone.

266
00:25:21,861 --> 00:25:23,781
Even I am not worried
about my life.

267
00:25:24,335 --> 00:25:26,484
But I am worried about you, Robby.

268
00:25:27,091 --> 00:25:31,294
If you listen to him,
we can be together forever.

269
00:25:33,226 --> 00:25:35,240
Speak up. Speak up, Robby.

270
00:25:35,551 --> 00:25:38,240
Then no one would ever
come in between us, right?

271
00:25:38,497 --> 00:25:40,334
- No one.
- Promise?

272
00:25:42,172 --> 00:25:43,686
Let's go.

273
00:25:44,388 --> 00:25:47,618
Mr. Robby, we are happy
with your decision.

274
00:25:47,929 --> 00:25:51,564
I am always at your service.
Tell me, what can I do for you?

275
00:25:51,887 --> 00:25:54,577
First job, you need to
send a man to hell.

276
00:25:54,657 --> 00:25:57,914
- What?
- You need to finish him.

277
00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:00,400
That's an easy thing to do.

278
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,157
This is not as easy
as you think it is.

279
00:26:03,711 --> 00:26:07,495
That man has been kept in a place
where we can't reach easily.

280
00:26:07,712 --> 00:26:10,212
- Where is he?
- Inside the jail.

281
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:12,708
We have found out that tomorrow..

282
00:26:12,788 --> 00:26:15,695
The police will make him confess
everything about our secrets.

283
00:26:16,685 --> 00:26:20,131
- So that means, I have to go to jail.
- Yes.

284
00:26:20,766 --> 00:26:24,510
Won't it help if I get him
here instead of killing him?

285
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:27,063
- Can you do that?
- Why not?

286
00:26:27,441 --> 00:26:29,644
If I can go inside the
jail and kill a man..

287
00:26:29,724 --> 00:26:31,804
- Then why can't I get him here?
- Wonderful, Robby!

288
00:26:31,846 --> 00:26:33,982
Did you see that? He is so brave.

289
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:37,279
This is the man's photograph.

290
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:39,995
Look at him properly.

291
00:27:04,644 --> 00:27:06,063
Hey you!

292
00:27:09,292 --> 00:27:12,630
How dare you? Do you know who I am?

293
00:27:13,711 --> 00:27:16,954
I am Badshah.
I have killed many people.

294
00:27:34,915 --> 00:27:37,740
Badshah, you are portraying
so much of your strength!

295
00:27:38,091 --> 00:27:39,931
Had I not come here for you..

296
00:27:40,011 --> 00:27:42,101
I would've killed you by now?
Understand?

297
00:27:42,888 --> 00:27:44,794
- Have you come here for me?
- Yes.

298
00:27:45,023 --> 00:27:46,929
I came inside the jail for you.

299
00:27:47,199 --> 00:27:50,861
Now listen! Here, we would stay..

300
00:27:51,401 --> 00:27:53,685
As if we don't know each other.
Understand?

301
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:11,376
Hey! What are you doing?

302
00:29:25,531 --> 00:29:28,126
Stay here. I will call up
at the hotel and come back.

303
00:29:28,206 --> 00:29:31,423
- Okay?
- Take care. The police is looking for us.

304
00:30:23,843 --> 00:30:26,545
Please hurry up! Please!

305
00:30:36,123 --> 00:30:37,271
Sorry.

306
00:30:53,488 --> 00:30:55,109
Poonam, it's you.

307
00:30:55,785 --> 00:30:57,457
Poonam.

308
00:30:58,793 --> 00:31:00,262
Didn't you recognise me?

309
00:31:00,342 --> 00:31:01,826
There are many men in the city.

310
00:31:01,906 --> 00:31:03,511
It is not necessary to
recognise all of them.

311
00:31:03,535 --> 00:31:07,104
- I am Suraj.
- There a lot of people with this name. So what?

312
00:31:07,184 --> 00:31:09,756
I... I used to study
with you in the college.

313
00:31:09,992 --> 00:31:12,560
A lot of guys used to
study with me in college.

314
00:31:12,914 --> 00:31:17,323
Oh! Then... Then I am sorry.

315
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:19,147
Suraj.

316
00:31:22,003 --> 00:31:25,178
Suraj, your habit of being disguised
hasn't changed even today.

317
00:31:27,662 --> 00:31:30,314
So, you did recognise me.

318
00:31:30,754 --> 00:31:33,525
How can I not recognise you?
Where were you?

319
00:31:34,099 --> 00:31:38,998
Poonam, you know that I am
the son of a poor mother..

320
00:31:39,078 --> 00:31:41,194
And you are a daughter
of a rich father.

321
00:31:42,224 --> 00:31:46,227
- The wall between the rich and poor...
- This wall is made up by you.

322
00:31:46,514 --> 00:31:48,845
I was tired of listening to
these things in college.

323
00:31:49,082 --> 00:31:50,082
Really?

324
00:31:50,331 --> 00:31:51,665
So, you are saying that..

325
00:31:51,926 --> 00:31:54,193
I made a mistake by staying away
from you for such a long time.

326
00:31:54,217 --> 00:31:55,619
Yes, Suraj.

327
00:31:55,873 --> 00:31:57,832
- Really?
- Really.

328
00:31:59,387 --> 00:32:01,278
What are you doing?

329
00:32:04,674 --> 00:32:06,819
I am rectifying my mistake.

330
00:32:09,994 --> 00:32:12,055
Its raining. Let's go inside.

331
00:32:16,464 --> 00:32:19,183
- Do you remember? What?
- First, you tell me.

332
00:32:20,197 --> 00:32:21,937
- No, you first.
- No, you first.

333
00:32:22,017 --> 00:32:23,609
You first.

334
00:32:26,549 --> 00:32:28,103
Do you remember, Suraj?

335
00:32:28,609 --> 00:32:30,924
That night it rained
just like this.

336
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:35,603
I was waiting for you
at the bus stand.

337
00:32:35,991 --> 00:32:38,913
I came running to meet
you from college.

338
00:32:38,993 --> 00:32:41,160
But the bus left before you came.

339
00:32:42,122 --> 00:32:44,082
That was your excuse.

340
00:32:44,162 --> 00:32:47,038
You were saving the
bus ticket money.

341
00:32:57,654 --> 00:33:04,514
"The one who loves you in this
world made by the almighty."

342
00:33:04,673 --> 00:33:11,551
"I hope no one loves
you more than I do."

343
00:33:11,808 --> 00:33:18,551
"The one who loves you in this
world made by the almighty,"

344
00:33:18,754 --> 00:33:25,754
"I hope no one loves
you more than I do."

345
00:33:25,834 --> 00:33:32,741
"The one who loves you in this
world made by the almighty..."

346
00:33:47,228 --> 00:33:54,147
"How will my heart tolerate it.."

347
00:33:54,363 --> 00:34:01,322
"When someone else
lauds about you?"

348
00:34:08,594 --> 00:34:15,500
"Even if mirror
praises your beauty.."

349
00:34:15,688 --> 00:34:22,647
"I swear on you, I will
break it in to pieces."

350
00:34:22,851 --> 00:34:29,823
"I am crazy about you,
your love and your style."

351
00:34:29,902 --> 00:34:36,958
"I pray none other me
gets crazy of it."

352
00:34:37,161 --> 00:34:44,256
"The one who loves you in this
world made by the almighty..."

353
00:35:12,971 --> 00:35:19,944
"I hope that day never
arrives when you.."

354
00:35:20,174 --> 00:35:26,849
"Have to leave me and
search for someone's love."

355
00:35:34,769 --> 00:35:41,513
"I hope you don't have to bow
your head to someone's laurels.."

356
00:35:41,593 --> 00:35:48,662
"Or look for someone to
share your sorrows."

357
00:35:48,742 --> 00:35:55,635
"I hope no one comes closer.."

358
00:35:55,905 --> 00:36:03,108
"To your heart other than me."

359
00:36:03,188 --> 00:36:10,432
"The one who loves you in this
world made by the almighty..."

360
00:36:17,917 --> 00:36:24,822
"You being hurt because of me."

361
00:36:24,902 --> 00:36:31,701
"I am sure such a day
will never arrive."

362
00:36:32,066 --> 00:36:39,120
"I am certain about my
loyalty towards you."

363
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:45,647
"Though afraid that your
love with betray me."

364
00:36:46,188 --> 00:36:52,863
"I pray that in this world
made by the almighty.."

365
00:36:53,390 --> 00:37:00,512
"I am with you forever."

366
00:37:00,592 --> 00:37:07,511
"The one who loves you in this
world made by the almighty..."

367
00:37:07,646 --> 00:37:14,823
"I am with you forever."

368
00:37:19,147 --> 00:37:22,349
Excuse me! If you are done calling..

369
00:37:22,429 --> 00:37:24,606
Then can I make a call?

370
00:37:26,971 --> 00:37:28,633
What nonsense is this!

371
00:37:30,728 --> 00:37:32,795
I am happy to meet you again.

372
00:37:33,011 --> 00:37:34,606
I become sad after meeting you.

373
00:37:34,686 --> 00:37:36,471
No need to be sad.

374
00:37:36,687 --> 00:37:39,782
I'm free tomorrow.
Do come tomorrow evening.

375
00:37:40,295 --> 00:37:44,363
You will meet me at the garden.
That's my challenge.

376
00:37:44,443 --> 00:37:47,903
This isn't a challenge,
it's a bribe. I'll leave.

377
00:38:03,147 --> 00:38:06,134
Hello? Hotel Apollo?

378
00:38:06,715 --> 00:38:08,228
Please put me to Mr. Jack.

379
00:38:11,621 --> 00:38:13,783
Hi! Robby here.

380
00:38:16,499 --> 00:38:19,621
I am not alone. Badshah is with me.

381
00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:22,026
We are behind the old fort.

382
00:38:22,810 --> 00:38:24,499
- Hold on.
- Okay.

383
00:38:28,067 --> 00:38:30,945
Ma'am, Robby has brought
Badshah out of the jail.

384
00:38:31,135 --> 00:38:32,999
They are behind the old fort.

385
00:38:33,256 --> 00:38:37,297
Right. Jack, ask
them to wait there.

386
00:38:37,851 --> 00:38:40,824
A car will reach over them to
get them tomorrow at 5 am.

387
00:39:12,728 --> 00:39:14,526
Excuse me, where are we going?

388
00:39:18,877 --> 00:39:21,161
Strange! I didn't
expect that answer.

389
00:39:24,755 --> 00:39:27,593
Ma'am, I am sorry.
May I ask you your name?

390
00:39:32,201 --> 00:39:33,728
Will you keep quiet?

391
00:39:33,808 --> 00:39:35,755
Strange! Again I didn't
expect this answer.

392
00:39:35,835 --> 00:39:37,701
- Don't ask anything to her now.
- Why?

393
00:39:37,891 --> 00:39:39,647
You will die and so will I.

394
00:39:43,201 --> 00:39:44,458
Police!

395
00:39:45,404 --> 00:39:46,674
Bend down.

396
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,875
Why did you stop the car?

397
00:41:32,233 --> 00:41:35,017
- Take this. Wear it.
- What for?

398
00:41:35,382 --> 00:41:38,477
This is needed because no one
has ever seen boss till date.

399
00:41:38,706 --> 00:41:41,868
And before she comes it is
important to wear these glasses.

400
00:41:42,058 --> 00:41:44,490
- But then with this...
- You won't be able to see anything.

401
00:41:44,814 --> 00:41:47,476
Robby, be alert.

402
00:41:47,963 --> 00:41:50,260
Don't interfere in
anything she says.

403
00:41:50,571 --> 00:41:52,638
Else, your life will be in danger.

404
00:42:08,476 --> 00:42:10,097
Come.

405
00:42:10,395 --> 00:42:11,733
So, you have reached!

406
00:42:12,895 --> 00:42:14,381
That too alive.

407
00:42:16,937 --> 00:42:21,193
I had ordered you that if you
are caught, consume poison.

408
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:24,018
How dare you not follow my orders?

409
00:42:24,098 --> 00:42:26,639
Didn't you know about
the consequences?

410
00:42:27,085 --> 00:42:29,464
I knew about it, ma'am.

411
00:42:30,126 --> 00:42:35,572
But I couldn't consume poison thinking
about my innocent wife and kids.

412
00:42:35,652 --> 00:42:38,437
Please forgive me, ma'am.
Please forgive me.

413
00:42:39,423 --> 00:42:44,071
Over here, you get rewarded for your
work and punished for your sins.

414
00:42:45,138 --> 00:42:48,030
You expect forgiveness from me!

415
00:42:49,396 --> 00:42:51,680
No one knows the meaning
of forgiveness here.

416
00:42:52,531 --> 00:42:54,112
- Jack!
- Yes, ma'am?

417
00:42:55,666 --> 00:42:58,977
Ma'am! Please forgive me, ma'am.

418
00:42:59,057 --> 00:43:00,896
Please forgive me.

419
00:43:00,976 --> 00:43:05,396
Don't pity me but at least
my innocent wife and kids.

420
00:43:05,476 --> 00:43:08,882
They don't have anyone, ma'am.
They will die of hunger.

421
00:43:08,962 --> 00:43:11,125
Forgive me, ma'am. Forgive me.

422
00:43:11,341 --> 00:43:12,719
Are you done?

423
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,638
- No! No, ma'am.
- Take him away!

424
00:43:18,003 --> 00:43:22,300
I cannot be punished like this.
No! Ma'am!

425
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:27,422
Leave me! Let go of me! Forgive me!
My kids will die!

426
00:43:27,502 --> 00:43:32,206
Ma'am! Please forgive me! Ma'am!

427
00:43:33,003 --> 00:43:34,246
Ma'am, can I...

428
00:43:34,882 --> 00:43:36,787
Why did you stop?

429
00:43:37,098 --> 00:43:40,517
You have done a very important work
for us. I am very happy with you.

430
00:43:41,246 --> 00:43:44,408
- Tell me, what do you want?
- Ma'am, I was saying that..

431
00:43:44,488 --> 00:43:47,989
If you wanted to kill him then
why did you get him released?

432
00:43:48,069 --> 00:43:52,557
It was to see your potential.
You have passed the exam.

433
00:43:52,746 --> 00:43:53,854
- Jack.
- Yes, ma'am?

434
00:43:53,934 --> 00:43:55,854
As long as the police
is looking for Robby..

435
00:43:56,057 --> 00:43:58,489
- Keep him underground.
- Okay, ma'am.

436
00:44:00,017 --> 00:44:01,017
Come.

437
00:44:18,166 --> 00:44:19,531
What is the matter, baby?

438
00:44:20,396 --> 00:44:22,369
Last night, I saw a dream.

439
00:44:23,694 --> 00:44:26,234
And today, the dream
broke into pieces.

440
00:44:26,950 --> 00:44:28,341
- Baby.
- What is it?

441
00:44:28,421 --> 00:44:30,044
Ma'am has called you for snacks.

442
00:44:30,124 --> 00:44:32,004
Tell her, I am not keeping well.

443
00:44:32,084 --> 00:44:33,274
Okay.

444
00:44:39,962 --> 00:44:41,706
Baby has said that she
isn't keeping well.

445
00:44:41,922 --> 00:44:44,368
What did she say?
That she isn't well!

446
00:44:50,719 --> 00:44:52,665
Now do I have to teach
your manners as well?

447
00:44:52,745 --> 00:44:55,557
Where did you send me in the morning?
Who were those people?

448
00:44:55,637 --> 00:44:57,394
How dare you?

449
00:44:57,854 --> 00:44:59,827
You know, I don't
need to answer you.

450
00:44:59,907 --> 00:45:02,380
I know but I think..

451
00:45:02,569 --> 00:45:05,245
I have taken the wrong step
by abiding to your orders.

452
00:45:05,325 --> 00:45:07,434
That's not your job.

453
00:45:07,665 --> 00:45:10,489
I am not a puppet who
will dance in your tunes.

454
00:45:11,462 --> 00:45:13,800
You will have to do that.

455
00:45:14,368 --> 00:45:18,624
You, the reputation of your family
and your dad's life is in my hands.

456
00:45:18,704 --> 00:45:21,381
- If you don't...
- I would rather die.

457
00:45:21,706 --> 00:45:23,679
I won't let you treat
me like a toy.

458
00:45:24,084 --> 00:45:26,962
It looks like you are
trying to be rebellious.

459
00:45:28,733 --> 00:45:32,395
Remember, if you speak against
me, I will chop off your tongue.

460
00:45:32,814 --> 00:45:34,848
If you show me your eyes
in anger, you will have to..

461
00:45:34,872 --> 00:45:36,872
See the dead body of you
father with these eyes.

462
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:42,301
Hello, my darling.

463
00:45:42,504 --> 00:45:46,085
What is this? The city isn't closed
today, there is no curfew either..

464
00:45:46,165 --> 00:45:49,247
And no politician is
put behind the bars..

465
00:45:49,327 --> 00:45:51,870
- Then why have you put a lock on the shop and this board?
- What can I do?

466
00:45:51,894 --> 00:45:54,030
You have made it
difficult for me here.

467
00:45:54,110 --> 00:45:55,868
Hence, I have closed the shop.

468
00:45:56,057 --> 00:45:58,382
And I have started with
this 'on the move shop'.

469
00:45:58,462 --> 00:46:00,302
I will deliver flowers
to my customers at home.

470
00:46:00,327 --> 00:46:04,301
Wow! That's a great idea!
Note my address as well.

471
00:46:04,531 --> 00:46:07,922
You can come to my home
considering me as your customer.

472
00:46:08,002 --> 00:46:10,368
I swear, I will pay you more.

473
00:46:10,448 --> 00:46:11,720
So will you come?

474
00:46:11,909 --> 00:46:15,139
You will pay me more!
Look at your pay first.

475
00:46:15,733 --> 00:46:18,666
What? Hey, you can't
just go like that.

476
00:46:18,746 --> 00:46:19,814
Listen!

477
00:47:08,293 --> 00:47:15,955
"I wish to get tangled with
your beautiful tresses."

478
00:47:17,077 --> 00:47:24,698
"I wish to get tangled with
your beautiful tresses."

479
00:47:25,658 --> 00:47:32,264
"That would be such a beautiful
sight. The world will see it.."

480
00:47:32,344 --> 00:47:34,693
"And so will I."

481
00:47:34,806 --> 00:47:42,806
"I wish to get tangled with
your beautiful tresses."

482
00:48:14,970 --> 00:48:19,294
"I have seen the entire world.."

483
00:48:19,374 --> 00:48:23,835
"But there's no one like you."

484
00:48:23,915 --> 00:48:28,213
"I have seen the entire world.."

485
00:48:28,293 --> 00:48:32,186
"But there's no one like you."

486
00:48:32,646 --> 00:48:36,943
"I have seen a lot of flowers.."

487
00:48:37,023 --> 00:48:40,916
"But not a beautiful
rose like you."

488
00:48:41,241 --> 00:48:45,768
"O my darling! I am mad about you."

489
00:48:46,011 --> 00:48:49,957
"Even the stars are
crazy about you."

490
00:48:50,037 --> 00:48:57,956
"The stars have a wish to
hide under your stole."

491
00:48:58,673 --> 00:49:04,915
"That would be such a beautiful
sight. The world will see it.."

492
00:49:04,995 --> 00:49:07,647
"And so will I."

493
00:49:07,727 --> 00:49:15,727
"I wish to get tangled with
your beautiful tresses."

494
00:49:52,864 --> 00:50:00,864
"Oh my darling, why shouldn't I call
you the Taj Mahal of my dreams."

495
00:50:01,755 --> 00:50:09,755
"Oh my darling, why shouldn't I call
you the Taj Mahal of my dreams."

496
00:50:10,621 --> 00:50:18,351
"Some day or the other I
will surely get your love."

497
00:50:19,432 --> 00:50:23,797
"Oh my darling,
I am mad about you."

498
00:50:23,877 --> 00:50:27,797
"The gardens are crazy about you."

499
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:36,000
"The gardens have a wish
to die loving you."

500
00:50:36,548 --> 00:50:42,941
"That would be such a beautiful
sight. The world will see it.."

501
00:50:43,021 --> 00:50:45,212
"And so will I."

502
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:56,836
Sir, there's a call for you.

503
00:50:58,565 --> 00:51:00,998
Yes? Yes, I am speaking.

504
00:51:02,285 --> 00:51:04,069
I will take some time to come.

505
00:51:04,696 --> 00:51:07,420
The thing is that I have
lot of work pressure now.

506
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:12,090
Also, some social work committee
members will be visiting you.

507
00:51:12,621 --> 00:51:16,285
I think give them about Rs 50,000.

508
00:51:21,162 --> 00:51:23,897
Greetings! I am sorry, I am late.

509
00:51:24,621 --> 00:51:29,972
I would like to thank all of you
for considering me for this.

510
00:51:30,264 --> 00:51:34,285
I am willing to be a part of the
'Women's Welfare Organisation'.

511
00:51:35,064 --> 00:51:40,535
I would like to present a cheque
of Rs 50,000 for the same.

512
00:51:40,827 --> 00:51:42,805
You are great, ma'am.

513
00:51:42,885 --> 00:51:45,940
Now it won't take time
to make the building.

514
00:51:46,373 --> 00:51:48,308
Please begin with the work.

515
00:51:48,388 --> 00:51:52,178
If you need more money,
I will arrange for that as well.

516
00:51:52,258 --> 00:51:53,302
That's great.

517
00:51:53,382 --> 00:51:56,120
You have a lot of
sympathy for the poor.

518
00:51:56,215 --> 00:51:57,850
May the almighty give
you more wealth.

519
00:51:57,930 --> 00:52:01,021
Sister, may Wahe Guru
bless you always.

520
00:52:01,703 --> 00:52:04,243
All this belongs to
my late husband.

521
00:52:04,708 --> 00:52:07,616
Please do pray for his
soul to rest in peace.

522
00:52:07,865 --> 00:52:09,372
Darling..

523
00:52:09,707 --> 00:52:13,910
I hope that your husband
Mr. Raj Kishor's soul rests in peace.

524
00:52:15,076 --> 00:52:16,417
What do you mean?

525
00:52:16,644 --> 00:52:19,080
If he doesn't inform us
about his secret wealth..

526
00:52:19,811 --> 00:52:21,802
It would be dangerous
to keep him alive.

527
00:52:23,866 --> 00:52:25,239
Even I think so.

528
00:52:26,245 --> 00:52:29,185
The way Poonam behaved
in the morning..

529
00:52:29,953 --> 00:52:31,305
I got scared.

530
00:52:32,526 --> 00:52:35,293
If she tells someone
that her dad is alive..

531
00:52:35,889 --> 00:52:37,489
And that he has been captured by us..

532
00:52:38,321 --> 00:52:40,861
Then the entire plan will fail.

533
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:44,278
Don't talk about the failure
of the plan, darling.

534
00:52:45,154 --> 00:52:48,278
Everything can happen in
the world except this.

535
00:52:49,110 --> 00:52:51,532
It is impossible for people
to learn about our reality.

536
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:56,018
But darling, what is our reality?

537
00:52:57,131 --> 00:53:00,958
The secret behind our success is that
we don't know about our reality.

538
00:53:01,304 --> 00:53:03,744
Then how will people know about it?
They are idiots after all.

539
00:53:06,267 --> 00:53:08,969
It is so much fun to make
a fool out of people.

540
00:53:10,039 --> 00:53:11,445
To make them dance in our tunes.

541
00:53:11,525 --> 00:53:13,693
Tell me, what sort of
person is your boss?

542
00:53:14,224 --> 00:53:17,748
Oh no, Robby! Don't ask
such questions tonight.

543
00:53:18,170 --> 00:53:21,359
Yes, even I have a lot of
expectations from tonight.

544
00:53:22,094 --> 00:53:23,532
You are lying.

545
00:53:24,603 --> 00:53:26,571
Lovers never lie.

546
00:53:27,252 --> 00:53:30,408
Robby, you really love, don't you?

547
00:53:31,382 --> 00:53:32,668
The almighty knows that better.

548
00:53:32,748 --> 00:53:34,376
Oh Robby!

549
00:53:34,456 --> 00:53:38,510
Today, I want that even if the
almighty is in between us today..

550
00:53:38,613 --> 00:53:39,740
He shouldn't be there.

551
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:41,490
Look at me.

552
00:53:42,237 --> 00:53:45,534
But a lot of people are
crazy about your beauty.

553
00:53:46,864 --> 00:53:50,302
But you are the one
for whom I am crazy.

554
00:53:50,994 --> 00:53:52,886
- Is it true?
- Yes.

555
00:53:53,675 --> 00:53:55,686
So, I am lucky in love.

556
00:53:56,421 --> 00:53:58,259
Helen, may I ask you something?

557
00:53:58,551 --> 00:54:02,162
- Can I go out for a while?
- Why?

558
00:54:02,421 --> 00:54:05,524
Why do you want to go
out when I am here?

559
00:54:05,604 --> 00:54:08,202
Some people have killed the
father of my poor friend.

560
00:54:08,282 --> 00:54:09,999
I need to go to that friend.

561
00:54:10,229 --> 00:54:11,756
He needs my help.

562
00:54:11,986 --> 00:54:14,877
- Is it? Are you so emotional?
- Yes.

563
00:54:14,957 --> 00:54:17,701
- Why? Do you doubt that?
- No.

564
00:54:18,296 --> 00:54:21,053
- Can I go?
- Is it necessary?

565
00:54:21,891 --> 00:54:25,634
But take care of yourself.
The police is looking for you.

566
00:54:25,851 --> 00:54:30,324
- I am not afraid of the police.
- I am crazy about your style.

567
00:54:30,824 --> 00:54:34,757
You know, if someone learns about
it that I showed you the way..

568
00:54:35,243 --> 00:54:37,419
Then they will kill me.

569
00:54:37,622 --> 00:54:40,595
Helen, I am with you and yet
you are scared of death!

570
00:54:40,865 --> 00:54:44,176
No. The ones who love are
not afraid of death.

571
00:54:44,514 --> 00:54:47,028
- Then show me the way out.
- Come.

572
00:55:41,352 --> 00:55:44,325
What's the need to come like
a thief in your own house?

573
00:55:44,595 --> 00:55:46,649
I thought of surprising you.

574
00:55:46,838 --> 00:55:48,892
I am surprised already.

575
00:55:49,190 --> 00:55:51,595
Whatever I saw was enough.

576
00:55:52,014 --> 00:55:53,107
What did you see?

577
00:55:53,417 --> 00:55:56,829
That you have chosen the wrong
path instead of the right one.

578
00:55:57,717 --> 00:56:01,041
Am I right? Why are you quiet?
Why don't you answer me?

579
00:56:03,418 --> 00:56:05,310
Sometimes silence
is the best answer.

580
00:56:09,542 --> 00:56:12,596
Poonam, I... Oh wow!

581
00:56:13,569 --> 00:56:15,218
I am scared of your eyes.

582
00:56:15,474 --> 00:56:18,447
I have seen everything. You are
running from the police, right?

583
00:56:20,164 --> 00:56:22,015
But you...

584
00:56:24,596 --> 00:56:26,436
You were driving the car
in the morning, right?

585
00:56:26,637 --> 00:56:28,718
Why are you quiet?
Why don't you answer me?

586
00:56:29,285 --> 00:56:31,110
Sometimes silence
is the best answer.

587
00:56:31,353 --> 00:56:35,150
Poonam, you are accusing me of
something but you too are at fault.

588
00:56:35,230 --> 00:56:36,529
Aren't you guilty?

589
00:56:36,609 --> 00:56:38,623
Aren't you too involved in crimes?

590
00:56:38,703 --> 00:56:41,650
- But I am...
- You are a girl and you are helpless, right?

591
00:56:41,908 --> 00:56:44,746
What sort of helplessness is this
that you can't tell me about?

592
00:56:44,826 --> 00:56:46,556
You are getting me wrong.

593
00:56:46,908 --> 00:56:48,705
You are right, Poonam.

594
00:56:49,921 --> 00:56:52,313
When I found you, I thought
I have got everything.

595
00:56:56,381 --> 00:56:57,867
I was wrong.

596
00:56:58,651 --> 00:57:02,516
Poonam, I am sure you have
a lot of aspirations.

597
00:57:03,502 --> 00:57:07,029
I am sure you aspire for a rich
and handsome groom for yourself.

598
00:57:07,583 --> 00:57:10,529
But... But I can't be any of that.

599
00:57:10,962 --> 00:57:13,083
Don't accuse me of such a thing.

600
00:57:14,002 --> 00:57:19,596
Then consider me as a
helpless man and be with me.

601
00:57:20,015 --> 00:57:22,691
- What do you mean?
- The path of crime.

602
00:57:22,894 --> 00:57:24,745
I can walk along with
you on that path.

603
00:57:25,083 --> 00:57:27,068
Don't make yourself
ashamed in front of me..

604
00:57:27,148 --> 00:57:28,877
So that I feel ashamed of myself.

605
00:57:29,110 --> 00:57:32,340
Oh! You didn't have to
say so many things.

606
00:57:32,813 --> 00:57:34,840
You could've simply denied.

607
00:57:35,138 --> 00:57:38,124
Anyway, I will walk alone.

608
00:57:38,408 --> 00:57:41,422
- Suraj.
- No, Poonam.

609
00:57:41,813 --> 00:57:46,218
The relationships that are
weak are better broken.

610
00:58:16,209 --> 00:58:18,114
Robby! Robby!

611
00:59:41,846 --> 00:59:49,846
"Why am I accused that I
have fallen in love?"

612
00:59:51,453 --> 00:59:59,453
"Why am I accused that I
have fallen in love?"

613
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:08,263
"I have always prayed
and worshipped you."

614
01:00:09,237 --> 01:00:17,237
"Why am I accused that I
have fallen in love?"

615
01:00:35,712 --> 01:00:43,712
"When have I ever asked for
anything for being loyal to you?"

616
01:00:48,913 --> 01:00:56,913
"When have I ever asked for
anything for being loyal to you?"

617
01:00:57,752 --> 01:01:05,752
"Have you ever heard any
complaints from me?"

618
01:01:06,509 --> 01:01:14,509
"Have you ever heard any
complaints from me?"

619
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:23,280
"I have never complained or
yearned on your actions."

620
01:01:24,125 --> 01:01:32,125
"I have never complained or
yearned on your actions."

621
01:01:32,832 --> 01:01:40,832
"I have always prayed
and worshipped you."

622
01:01:58,839 --> 01:02:06,839
"There's no sorrow if you
couldn't be mine forever."

623
01:02:12,016 --> 01:02:19,799
"There's no sorrow if you
couldn't be mine forever."

624
01:02:20,512 --> 01:02:28,512
"The sorrow is that your
own couldn't be your own."

625
01:02:29,357 --> 01:02:37,357
"The sorrow is that your
own couldn't be your own."

626
01:02:38,093 --> 01:02:46,093
"You are in such a sad
state because of someone."

627
01:02:46,745 --> 01:02:54,745
"You are in such a sad
state because of someone."

628
01:02:55,410 --> 01:03:03,410
"I have always prayed
and worshipped you."

629
01:03:03,956 --> 01:03:11,508
"Why am I accused that I
have fallen in love?"

630
01:03:31,789 --> 01:03:33,854
You? Why are you here?

631
01:03:34,254 --> 01:03:36,200
Go away. Go away from here.

632
01:03:36,280 --> 01:03:39,540
Sir, decent men do not behave
like this with their wife.

633
01:03:39,620 --> 01:03:42,697
Wife? She is my wife! Rubbish!

634
01:03:43,140 --> 01:03:45,497
- Pran Nath!
- That's my name, darling.

635
01:03:46,458 --> 01:03:47,680
Sorry.

636
01:03:48,156 --> 01:03:51,680
My dear husband, please
show some mercy on me.

637
01:03:52,350 --> 01:03:55,345
This evil man wants
to make me a widow.

638
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:58,945
Protect yourself and
please tell him..

639
01:03:59,025 --> 01:04:00,740
Where is the box of diamonds?

640
01:04:01,399 --> 01:04:04,145
I won't say. Never!

641
01:04:04,567 --> 01:04:07,572
Go away. Just go away from here.

642
01:04:08,037 --> 01:04:11,198
Dear God, why do you
send such shameless..

643
01:04:11,278 --> 01:04:14,062
And selfish women
in to this world?

644
01:04:14,740 --> 01:04:16,568
I can't take it anymore.

645
01:04:16,849 --> 01:04:20,297
Help me die, oh Lord! Help me die.

646
01:04:20,621 --> 01:04:25,032
The decision of you life and death
lies in my hands, not in God's hands.

647
01:04:25,637 --> 01:04:27,594
Tell me, where is the
box of diamonds?

648
01:04:28,621 --> 01:04:32,405
Tell me, else along with you I will
kill your daughter, Poonam as well.

649
01:04:33,346 --> 01:04:36,247
Poonam... Poonam...

650
01:04:36,327 --> 01:04:39,467
No, please don't do that.
Don't do that.

651
01:04:39,867 --> 01:04:43,570
For God's sake, have some
mercy on that innocent girl.

652
01:04:44,003 --> 01:04:45,948
Have mercy on her.

653
01:04:46,028 --> 01:04:50,624
If you can't have mercy
on her then how can we?

654
01:04:50,704 --> 01:04:53,192
Husband darling, not for yourself..

655
01:04:53,272 --> 01:04:56,705
But for the sake of your daughter,
tell us about it. Think about her.

656
01:04:57,462 --> 01:05:02,191
Speak up. We will free you
and your daughter as well.

657
01:05:02,571 --> 01:05:07,219
Poonam will be free.
My daughter will be free.

658
01:05:07,435 --> 01:05:08,949
Right now.

659
01:05:09,152 --> 01:05:12,206
But this is provided the two of
you leave the country forever.

660
01:05:12,286 --> 01:05:15,247
Yes, both of us will
leave the country.

661
01:05:15,327 --> 01:05:17,193
Poonam and me.

662
01:05:18,301 --> 01:05:21,179
- Are you telling the truth?
- I promise.

663
01:05:21,652 --> 01:05:23,625
Now tell me. Where is
the box of diamonds?

664
01:05:24,279 --> 01:05:26,182
I will tell you. I will tell you.

665
01:05:26,528 --> 01:05:29,155
There is temple behind the bungalow.

666
01:05:29,716 --> 01:05:32,722
It is right under the idol.

667
01:07:33,261 --> 01:07:35,085
She left? Did she really go?

668
01:07:36,409 --> 01:07:38,990
I got it. She left. I am coming.

669
01:07:41,220 --> 01:07:44,071
You should go and call the police.

670
01:07:44,274 --> 01:07:45,706
Greetings!

671
01:07:46,085 --> 01:07:47,747
Why are you here at this hour?

672
01:07:47,827 --> 01:07:52,625
Today, I have come to give you
something and not take anything.

673
01:07:52,882 --> 01:07:57,990
Till date, the amount of garlands
you have given me as loan..

674
01:07:58,207 --> 01:08:02,882
I was thinking about paying
you all the money at once.

675
01:08:03,098 --> 01:08:06,193
But I saw a bottle of
perfume in front of me..

676
01:08:06,395 --> 01:08:09,233
And I saw you in the bottle.

677
01:08:09,422 --> 01:08:12,517
As today is not Tuesday..

678
01:08:12,597 --> 01:08:16,625
I started thinking
more than my capacity.

679
01:08:16,935 --> 01:08:21,097
So, I could imagine you as a
beautiful foreigner woman.

680
01:08:21,423 --> 01:08:24,396
That's why I brought
this bottle for you.

681
01:08:25,395 --> 01:08:31,692
Darling, give me the permission
to spray all of it on you.

682
01:08:32,247 --> 01:08:38,328
The smell of alcohol has ruined
my record in front of you.

683
01:08:38,680 --> 01:08:41,383
I want to ward off that smell
with the help of this perfume.

684
01:08:41,937 --> 01:08:44,829
Now, come closer to me.

685
01:08:45,370 --> 01:08:48,194
Hey, you can change my destiny.

686
01:08:48,274 --> 01:08:51,545
Unless you stop drinking,
your destiny will never change.

687
01:08:51,625 --> 01:08:55,018
I am ready to let go of this habit.

688
01:08:55,234 --> 01:08:57,923
But this habit is not
ready to leave me.

689
01:08:58,180 --> 01:09:01,058
The habit has caught
hold on to me tightly.

690
01:09:03,071 --> 01:09:05,679
I was talking about catching
and the police has arrived.

691
01:09:05,881 --> 01:09:08,421
They are so intelligent.
I'll be right back.

692
01:09:08,502 --> 01:09:10,787
I think they are a bit worried.

693
01:09:11,733 --> 01:09:14,490
Tell me, how may I help you?

694
01:09:14,569 --> 01:09:19,394
If you need someone's address,
we don't know anything about it.

695
01:09:19,475 --> 01:09:21,760
Ask someone else. Thank you. Bye.

696
01:09:21,840 --> 01:09:23,868
- Mister.
- Good boy.

697
01:09:23,948 --> 01:09:27,990
- Mister, I have come here for you. Please come along.
- For me?

698
01:09:28,069 --> 01:09:31,705
- Don't joke, inspector. The alcohol effect will go away.
- I see.

699
01:09:32,544 --> 01:09:34,773
- So, you are drunk as well.
- There you go.

700
01:09:35,057 --> 01:09:38,071
You and she have similar
complaints with me.

701
01:09:38,273 --> 01:09:40,678
Sir, I am not hiding this
from my would-be wife and..

702
01:09:40,758 --> 01:09:43,341
Hence I won't hide it
from an inspector either.

703
01:09:43,421 --> 01:09:45,692
But you won't believe my troubles.

704
01:09:45,772 --> 01:09:48,611
Inspector, this is
the bottle he stole.

705
01:09:48,691 --> 01:09:50,530
- Stole?
- Yes!

706
01:09:50,609 --> 01:09:54,787
Hey, mind your language
else I won't spare you.

707
01:09:54,867 --> 01:09:57,125
Quiet! Give it to me.

708
01:09:57,571 --> 01:09:59,584
- Let me check it.
- It's a perfume bottle.

709
01:10:01,611 --> 01:10:03,665
Hey! Those are diamonds!

710
01:10:03,745 --> 01:10:05,692
If these are diamonds
then keep them with you.

711
01:10:05,772 --> 01:10:08,368
- We just want perfume.
- Oh really!

712
01:10:08,448 --> 01:10:10,341
You are acting very smart.

713
01:10:10,421 --> 01:10:15,056
- Inspector, he is the culprit.
- No. He is not a culprit.

714
01:10:15,136 --> 01:10:16,570
I know him very well.

715
01:10:16,650 --> 01:10:19,315
Had he known there were diamonds in
it, he would've told me about it.

716
01:10:19,339 --> 01:10:21,826
- You are his partner.
- Shut up, shorty!

717
01:10:21,906 --> 01:10:23,975
Such a stupid fellow.
Is he with you?

718
01:10:24,055 --> 01:10:25,745
He is my elder brother, Pahua.

719
01:10:25,825 --> 01:10:27,556
Stop this nonsense.

720
01:10:27,636 --> 01:10:29,556
The police has been searching
for these diamonds.

721
01:10:29,894 --> 01:10:31,597
Okay. Why are you bothering me?

722
01:10:31,786 --> 01:10:34,146
Everyone will know that we are
the best detectives in India.

723
01:10:34,205 --> 01:10:37,218
- That I can see already.
- Stop this nonsense.

724
01:10:38,272 --> 01:10:41,516
- Come with me.
- No problem. You should go.

725
01:10:41,596 --> 01:10:44,272
- I will come to get you released.
- Really?

726
01:10:44,352 --> 01:10:46,204
Alright. Take me along. Let's go.

727
01:10:46,284 --> 01:10:51,393
- Listen, tomorrow morning get two half fry eggs for breakfast.
- Let's go!

728
01:10:57,529 --> 01:10:59,583
- Darling.
- You are here.

729
01:10:59,663 --> 01:11:00,881
- Yes.
- What happened?

730
01:11:00,961 --> 01:11:02,746
All our dreams will come true.

731
01:11:05,610 --> 01:11:10,786
Today in the evening, a plane filled
with gold will land near the old cave.

732
01:11:11,084 --> 01:11:12,421
- Really?
- Yes.

733
01:11:12,611 --> 01:11:13,989
Did you give them the money?

734
01:11:14,069 --> 01:11:16,056
Rs 50 crore has been sent.

735
01:11:17,098 --> 01:11:21,084
By tomorrow morning, we will have
so much gold that no king ever had.

736
01:11:21,164 --> 01:11:22,814
But darling..

737
01:11:23,192 --> 01:11:25,712
This time the responsibility of
unloading the gold is on you.

738
01:11:26,205 --> 01:11:28,367
- It wouldn't be right for me to go there.
- Why not?

739
01:11:29,894 --> 01:11:31,498
Previously, the police
learnt about our..

740
01:11:31,578 --> 01:11:33,418
Private plane and it has
caused huge losses.

741
01:11:34,043 --> 01:11:36,557
This time we have to keep
an eye on the police.

742
01:11:36,827 --> 01:11:39,462
And that no one other
than me can do.

743
01:11:40,786 --> 01:11:43,191
Okay. I will handle everything.

744
01:11:58,720 --> 01:12:01,544
Today, I will be handing
over a very important work.

745
01:12:02,355 --> 01:12:04,922
I am doing this because
I trust you completely.

746
01:12:05,165 --> 01:12:08,598
I am honoured, ma'am.
Tell me, what is it?

747
01:12:08,881 --> 01:12:16,016
Tonight at 2am a plane will land
near the old caves on Agra road.

748
01:12:16,881 --> 01:12:19,530
I will give you a
loyal person along.

749
01:12:20,665 --> 01:12:22,625
There are 20 boxes in that plane.

750
01:12:23,719 --> 01:12:26,192
Your job is to get
those boxes here.

751
01:12:26,272 --> 01:12:28,350
Ma'am, may I know what
is there in those boxes?

752
01:12:28,430 --> 01:12:30,064
Just a minute, Mr. Robby!

753
01:12:30,246 --> 01:12:33,314
You are not allowed to
ask such questions.

754
01:12:33,530 --> 01:12:36,300
I forgive you because this
is your first mistake.

755
01:12:36,380 --> 01:12:38,030
- You may go now.
- I am sorry, ma'am.

756
01:12:38,733 --> 01:12:40,124
Good luck.

757
01:12:51,827 --> 01:12:52,908
Jack.

758
01:12:56,341 --> 01:12:58,571
Keep an eye on him.

759
01:13:15,125 --> 01:13:17,854
Excuse me, is Mrs. Indrani home?

760
01:13:17,934 --> 01:13:21,179
She is upstairs in her room.
Please sit, I will call her.

761
01:13:21,435 --> 01:13:23,003
But who are you?

762
01:13:39,922 --> 01:13:42,098
You? At this hour?

763
01:13:42,178 --> 01:13:43,828
Yes, its important.

764
01:13:43,908 --> 01:13:46,436
- I guess you have made a huge mistake.
- What?

765
01:13:46,516 --> 01:13:49,463
- You should've gone to get the boxes from the plane yourself.
- Why?

766
01:13:49,652 --> 01:13:52,990
I have got the information that a CID
official is a part of our group.

767
01:13:53,070 --> 01:13:55,382
- Impossible!
- Nothing is impossible.

768
01:13:55,462 --> 01:13:58,651
- Whom did you send as an incharge?
- Mr. Robby.

769
01:13:58,731 --> 01:14:02,043
- Who is Robby?
- He is the one who brought Badshah out of the jail.

770
01:14:03,935 --> 01:14:05,597
Is he the one?

771
01:14:05,881 --> 01:14:07,827
The face is very similar.

772
01:14:08,029 --> 01:14:12,164
- He is CID inspector Suraj.
- Oh my God! What now?

773
01:14:12,516 --> 01:14:16,772
Follow him. And finish him
before the plane lands anyhow.

774
01:14:17,137 --> 01:14:19,758
I will go to the control room
and try to delay the plane.

775
01:14:20,367 --> 01:14:22,245
We just have 20 mins. Hurry up!

776
01:14:41,083 --> 01:14:44,691
Hello? Hello? BRX? BRX?

777
01:14:56,502 --> 01:14:59,840
Hello? Hello? Captain? BRX?

778
01:15:09,718 --> 01:15:14,785
Hello? BRX! Captain! Hello?
Why isn't he able to listen?

779
01:19:51,867 --> 01:19:52,975
Hello, boss.

780
01:20:30,398 --> 01:20:32,078
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening, Suraj.

781
01:20:32,431 --> 01:20:34,539
You have helped our
country in a big way.

782
01:20:34,726 --> 01:20:36,022
- Congratulations!
- Thank you, sir.

783
01:20:36,046 --> 01:20:40,133
Sir. Sir. The hotel
waiter is innocent.

784
01:20:40,213 --> 01:20:42,583
He didn't know that there are
diamonds inside the perfume bottle.

785
01:20:42,607 --> 01:20:46,082
- Who are you?
- I am Phulwari. I have come to get him a bail.

786
01:20:46,325 --> 01:20:48,946
Sir, please release me.

787
01:20:49,216 --> 01:20:51,446
How will I get a golden
opportunity like this again?

788
01:20:51,865 --> 01:20:54,041
I might lose my job as a waiter.

789
01:20:54,325 --> 01:20:57,474
- But I can be her husband soon.
- Am I right?

790
01:20:57,554 --> 01:21:00,379
Sir, you can release him.
Those diamonds are fake.

791
01:21:00,650 --> 01:21:03,231
- Release him.
- Open it.

792
01:21:03,568 --> 01:21:05,528
Your mother had called up.
She is waiting for you.

793
01:21:05,581 --> 01:21:07,650
Alright, sir. I'll leave.
Good night.

794
01:21:09,894 --> 01:21:10,989
Sir!

795
01:21:11,340 --> 01:21:17,056
How dare you get him released
whom we caught red handed?

796
01:21:17,136 --> 01:21:18,136
Who are you?

797
01:21:18,177 --> 01:21:21,422
- We are the best detectives in India.
- The best detectives!

798
01:21:21,502 --> 01:21:24,219
We were the one who
got Jani arrested.

799
01:21:24,462 --> 01:21:27,760
But I think you have been trained
wrongly in being a detective.

800
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:32,341
What are you talking about? We teach
how to be a detective ourselves.

801
01:21:32,421 --> 01:21:36,030
- Is it?
- Constable, throw them out.

802
01:21:36,110 --> 01:21:37,611
What!

803
01:21:37,691 --> 01:21:40,368
- C'mon! Move out.
- Let's go.

804
01:21:45,678 --> 01:21:47,192
Look, who is here.

805
01:21:51,300 --> 01:21:52,529
Poonam.

806
01:21:52,962 --> 01:21:55,597
You two should talk.
I'll get some tea.

807
01:22:23,542 --> 01:22:25,286
I am sorry, Suraj. I am very sorry.

808
01:22:25,366 --> 01:22:26,732
I am also very sorry.

809
01:22:27,164 --> 01:22:28,759
I couldn't tell you the truth.

810
01:22:29,110 --> 01:22:31,421
- But Poonam, I didn't understand one thing.
- What?

811
01:22:31,501 --> 01:22:33,975
What was the need to dance
to Mrs. Indrani's tunes?

812
01:22:34,055 --> 01:22:35,921
I wanted to save my dad's life.

813
01:22:36,975 --> 01:22:38,556
- Your dad?
- Yes.

814
01:22:39,312 --> 01:22:42,921
But... But I guess
he died 7 years ago.

815
01:22:43,001 --> 01:22:45,447
- That's what the world thinks.
- What do you mean?

816
01:22:45,527 --> 01:22:47,407
Suraj, my dad is alive.

817
01:22:47,487 --> 01:22:49,731
- What are you saying?
- I am telling the truth.

818
01:22:49,811 --> 01:22:51,082
I met him once.

819
01:22:51,162 --> 01:22:53,920
- But where is he?
- He is captured.

820
01:22:54,217 --> 01:22:56,285
He is kept at some unknown place.

821
01:22:56,365 --> 01:22:59,312
- Why didn't you tell me before about it?
- I was scared of mom.

822
01:22:59,392 --> 01:23:04,717
I was told that if I mention about it
to anyone then they will kill him.

823
01:23:05,379 --> 01:23:07,919
Not only did I have to keep quiet.

824
01:23:07,999 --> 01:23:09,892
I had to listen to
everything they said.

825
01:23:10,095 --> 01:23:13,582
They said...
What do you mean by 'they'?

826
01:23:13,946 --> 01:23:16,838
There was another man behind
all the crimes my mom did.

827
01:23:16,918 --> 01:23:18,987
Mom used to dance in his tunes.

828
01:23:19,905 --> 01:23:22,919
Who is he? Have you ever seen him?

829
01:23:22,999 --> 01:23:25,635
Yes, when you went to unload
the gold from the plane..

830
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,040
That man came and gave
your photograph to mom.

831
01:23:28,527 --> 01:23:34,838
I see. That means, a mastermind
is working behind Mrs. Indrani.

832
01:23:35,500 --> 01:23:39,514
If I don't catch that man,
all my efforts will be wasted.

833
01:23:44,879 --> 01:23:47,825
- Hello? Who is it?
- I am advocate Pran.

834
01:23:48,596 --> 01:23:51,677
Greetings. I want to
congratulate you.

835
01:23:52,392 --> 01:23:55,581
The CID needs brave
officers like you.

836
01:23:55,661 --> 01:23:59,176
Mr. Pran, I was thinking about you.
I have some important work with you.

837
01:24:00,743 --> 01:24:02,446
Important work with me! Now!

838
01:24:03,838 --> 01:24:07,662
You can come and meet me.
I am at home. I will wait for you.

839
01:24:07,932 --> 01:24:09,297
Okay, I am coming.

840
01:24:09,377 --> 01:24:12,689
- Suraj, who was it?
- Advocate Pran.

841
01:24:13,582 --> 01:24:16,474
You may not know that he is a
well-known lawyer in this city.

842
01:24:17,541 --> 01:24:19,366
Your dad's murder case
was in his hands.

843
01:24:20,014 --> 01:24:21,974
If your dad is alive..

844
01:24:23,460 --> 01:24:25,474
Then Mr. Pran...

845
01:25:30,622 --> 01:25:32,487
I want to meet Mr. Pran.

846
01:25:32,906 --> 01:25:34,973
- Are you Mr. Suraj?
- Yes.

847
01:25:35,446 --> 01:25:38,027
Please come in.
He is waiting for you.

848
01:25:41,082 --> 01:25:42,839
- May I come in?
- Come in.

849
01:25:44,689 --> 01:25:47,973
- Hello, Mr. Pran.
- Please come, Mr. Suraj.

850
01:25:48,230 --> 01:25:50,581
All the newspapers are
talking about you.

851
01:25:50,798 --> 01:25:53,298
You have brought pride to
the police department.

852
01:25:53,824 --> 01:25:55,676
It reminds me of the
days when I was young.

853
01:25:55,756 --> 01:25:57,405
- Have some.
- No, thanks. I don't drink.

854
01:25:57,824 --> 01:26:00,176
Mr. Pran, I always think of you.

855
01:26:00,256 --> 01:26:03,338
But what are your thoughts
about Mrs. Indrani?

856
01:26:03,418 --> 01:26:05,405
I can't really say much about her.

857
01:26:06,906 --> 01:26:10,057
What is shocking is that this women
was considered to be so decent..

858
01:26:10,384 --> 01:26:11,957
Now she has been
proved so dangerous.

859
01:26:12,568 --> 01:26:14,433
How did you manage to unmask her?

860
01:26:14,892 --> 01:26:17,905
- She hasn't been unmasked completely.
- What do you mean?

861
01:26:17,985 --> 01:26:21,000
There is another person involved
apart from Mrs. Indrani.

862
01:26:21,230 --> 01:26:23,513
- Who?
- No one has seen him until now.

863
01:26:24,230 --> 01:26:27,594
- How can you say that?
- I can say a lot more, Mr. Pran.

864
01:26:28,459 --> 01:26:31,311
Mr. Raj Kishor was
murdered 7 years ago.

865
01:26:31,391 --> 01:26:33,338
- But that was a fraud.
- What?

866
01:26:33,418 --> 01:26:36,297
He wasn't murdered.
Mr. Raj Kishor is still alive.

867
01:26:36,514 --> 01:26:39,190
Impossible! That's not possible.

868
01:26:39,270 --> 01:26:42,514
After 7 years of his death, you
are telling me that he is alive.

869
01:26:43,257 --> 01:26:46,000
- It's ridiculous.
- It's my job to prove it.

870
01:26:46,230 --> 01:26:48,109
I have come here to
discuss about this.

871
01:26:48,189 --> 01:26:52,055
I want some old clues that can
make Mrs. Indrani open her mouth..

872
01:26:52,135 --> 01:26:55,460
- And reveal the name of her partner.
- Who can it be?

873
01:26:55,920 --> 01:26:58,348
When Mr. Indrani sent me to
get the gold from the plane..

874
01:26:58,817 --> 01:27:00,977
That man brought my photograph
and showed it to her.

875
01:27:02,529 --> 01:27:07,232
- Did someone see him?
- The one who saw him told me about it.

876
01:27:07,312 --> 01:27:10,502
- Then you should find out about him.
- About whom?

877
01:27:10,786 --> 01:27:13,313
I mean, the leader. Who else?

878
01:27:15,422 --> 01:27:17,530
Whom were you with
before coming here?

879
01:27:17,732 --> 01:27:20,692
I was speaking with my mom
that's when you called.

880
01:27:20,772 --> 01:27:22,584
- She knows you very well.
- Yes.

881
01:27:22,664 --> 01:27:24,800
- Where are you going now?
- Police headquarters.

882
01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:26,435
- At this hour?
- Yes.

883
01:27:26,664 --> 01:27:30,597
I have to make Mrs. Indrani confess
and reveal the name of the leader.

884
01:27:30,935 --> 01:27:32,759
Do you think she will
reveal it easily?

885
01:27:32,839 --> 01:27:36,124
Mr. Pran, she is a woman after all.
She will say it some day.

886
01:27:36,421 --> 01:27:38,029
Let's go. I'll come along.

887
01:27:38,109 --> 01:27:39,473
- I might be of some help.
- Sure.

888
01:27:39,553 --> 01:27:40,553
Let's go.

889
01:28:15,784 --> 01:28:19,622
Mrs. Indrani, I am here to
ask some questions to you.

890
01:28:20,271 --> 01:28:23,798
- 7 years ago when you got married...
- What about my marriage?

891
01:28:23,878 --> 01:28:27,392
Mrs. Indrani, I am sure that someone
is involved with you in this crime.

892
01:28:27,472 --> 01:28:31,243
- I have not committed any crime and I don't have any partner.
- You are lying.

893
01:28:38,717 --> 01:28:40,231
I am sure you know him.

894
01:28:41,636 --> 01:28:45,217
When you husband drowned
and people doubted you..

895
01:28:45,297 --> 01:28:47,177
He had conducted the
investigation that time.

896
01:28:47,758 --> 01:28:50,408
Looking at Mrs. Indrani's
condition today,

897
01:28:50,819 --> 01:28:53,971
I am reminded of how
she was 7 years ago.

898
01:28:55,298 --> 01:28:59,217
Even then her forehead was sweating
and I has asked her to relax.

899
01:29:00,433 --> 01:29:04,271
Even today, I wish to
say the same thing.

900
01:29:04,919 --> 01:29:07,946
- Don't worry.
- The situation then was different, Mr. Pran.

901
01:29:08,189 --> 01:29:10,189
In this case, she
cannot be relieved.

902
01:29:10,269 --> 01:29:11,973
I just need one favour from you.

903
01:29:12,202 --> 01:29:15,324
- If this case is connected to the one 7 years ago...
- Yes, Mr. Suraj.

904
01:29:15,770 --> 01:29:19,662
I have seen all the files.
There is one clue.

905
01:29:20,310 --> 01:29:22,351
It might help in this situation.

906
01:29:23,904 --> 01:29:27,648
When she was accused
that time, she had said..

907
01:29:28,134 --> 01:29:32,026
That her daughter Poonam is involved
in the murder of her husband.

908
01:29:33,080 --> 01:29:34,972
But there were no clues.

909
01:29:36,107 --> 01:29:39,499
Now we need to find out about
the one involved with Poonam.

910
01:29:40,445 --> 01:29:42,553
Maybe that person is
involved in this case.

911
01:29:42,633 --> 01:29:44,553
That's not possible, Mr. Pran.

912
01:29:46,917 --> 01:29:47,932
Strange!

913
01:29:48,159 --> 01:29:52,279
You are in intelligence officer and
yet thinking of the impossible!

914
01:29:52,931 --> 01:29:55,093
I remember everything
about the case.

915
01:29:55,850 --> 01:30:01,174
I also remember that
Mrs. Indrani had hurt herself.

916
01:30:01,796 --> 01:30:03,796
The wounds were even
shown in the court.

917
01:30:04,553 --> 01:30:07,607
I guess she might have
the marks even now.

918
01:30:15,202 --> 01:30:18,175
Take a look. I wasn't wrong.

919
01:30:18,391 --> 01:30:20,973
You remember such might details!

920
01:30:21,621 --> 01:30:23,905
That's the reason I am
asking you to find Poonam.

921
01:30:24,648 --> 01:30:28,351
But Mr. Pran, the person who gave
my photo to Mrs. Indrani was a man.

922
01:30:28,431 --> 01:30:32,865
Mr. Suraj, your informer has
tried to manipulate you.

923
01:30:33,527 --> 01:30:35,351
Anyway, you can think about it.

924
01:30:35,676 --> 01:30:37,527
Do call me if you need me.

925
01:30:37,933 --> 01:30:41,055
- I would be happy to help. Good night.
- Good night.

926
01:30:42,163 --> 01:30:43,690
Good bye.

927
01:30:51,866 --> 01:30:57,662
Mrs. Indrani, is it true that Poonam
planned Mr. Raj Kishor's murder?

928
01:30:57,946 --> 01:30:59,635
- Yes, it is.
- Why?

929
01:30:59,852 --> 01:31:01,852
Because she wanted to
break our marriage.

930
01:31:02,135 --> 01:31:06,473
All the accusations on me actually
belong to Poonam. I am innocent.

931
01:31:06,878 --> 01:31:10,243
Did you forget that you had sent me
to unload the gold from the plane?

932
01:31:11,054 --> 01:31:15,676
- Me? You? Unload the gold?
- Yes!

933
01:31:15,756 --> 01:31:17,486
You had sent me there.

934
01:31:17,566 --> 01:31:19,176
- Poonam must've sent you.
- How come?

935
01:31:19,256 --> 01:31:21,568
- By dressing up like me.
- And changing her face too!

936
01:31:21,865 --> 01:31:25,136
Mrs. Indrani, your cleverness
is of no use now.

937
01:31:25,216 --> 01:31:27,299
You are very decent
woman in front of the world..

938
01:31:27,379 --> 01:31:29,201
But I know your reality.

939
01:31:29,542 --> 01:31:32,636
You lured a decent man
and got married to him.

940
01:31:32,825 --> 01:31:36,352
Then transferred all the property
in your name and murdered him.

941
01:31:36,568 --> 01:31:41,055
But I know... I know that he has
been kept as a hostage by you.

942
01:31:41,135 --> 01:31:43,595
- That's a lie.
- People consider as a goddess..

943
01:31:43,675 --> 01:31:46,865
Because you donate lacs of
rupees for temples and schools.

944
01:31:47,285 --> 01:31:50,744
But you own such hotels where
crimes are planned day and night.

945
01:31:51,082 --> 01:31:53,528
They are a shame for the society.

946
01:31:54,041 --> 01:31:56,021
Mrs. Indrani, you
belong to the league..

947
01:31:56,101 --> 01:31:58,852
Who is neither religious nor
compassionate towards people.

948
01:31:58,932 --> 01:32:01,325
- Someone's life is of no worth to you!
- Shut up!

949
01:32:01,405 --> 01:32:03,338
You will be hanged to death!

950
01:32:10,744 --> 01:32:14,190
Now you have realised how important
life is to human beings.

951
01:32:15,447 --> 01:32:18,744
When innocent people were
killed because of your orders..

952
01:32:19,096 --> 01:32:22,743
Kids were left like orphans,
women were widowed..

953
01:32:22,871 --> 01:32:24,743
Why didn't you realise
this at that moment?

954
01:32:25,812 --> 01:32:28,015
- Let go me. Leave me.
- These are hands of the laws..

955
01:32:28,095 --> 01:32:30,241
And you cannot
save yourself from it.

956
01:32:30,944 --> 01:32:33,348
There is just one way
you can save yourself.

957
01:32:33,706 --> 01:32:35,721
Tell me the name of the person..

958
01:32:35,956 --> 01:32:38,358
Who took you through the
crimes you committed.

959
01:32:38,438 --> 01:32:40,755
He is the one who has left
you in this situation.

960
01:32:40,855 --> 01:32:45,506
If you want to save yourself then
reveal his name. Say it! Say it! Say!

961
01:32:45,742 --> 01:32:50,151
- I am telling.
- Say! Hurry up! Say it! Say it!

962
01:32:54,407 --> 01:32:58,579
Constable! Take her away!

963
01:33:03,242 --> 01:33:04,796
Sir, she is dead.

964
01:33:05,590 --> 01:33:06,992
Sir!

965
01:33:15,269 --> 01:33:17,330
Now you will see my
brains as a lawyer.

966
01:33:19,170 --> 01:33:21,180
Suraj is completely trapped now.

967
01:33:22,076 --> 01:33:27,042
Jack, register me as the lawyer
of Mrs. Indrani in the court.

968
01:33:27,413 --> 01:33:28,781
Yes, boss.

969
01:33:32,261 --> 01:33:37,160
Mr. Suraj is considered to be a very
efficient and righteous officer.

970
01:33:37,869 --> 01:33:41,923
But it looks like this is
brass that seems to be gold.

971
01:33:42,003 --> 01:33:45,436
Suraj has confessed
to all of you that..

972
01:33:45,740 --> 01:33:50,757
Mrs. Indrani is not the leader of
the smugglers but someone else.

973
01:33:51,129 --> 01:33:55,470
But no one apart from her
knew who that person was.

974
01:33:55,550 --> 01:33:58,426
That's I can say it
with assurance that..

975
01:33:58,730 --> 01:34:01,973
After Suraj caught the
gold worth lacs of rupees..

976
01:34:02,210 --> 01:34:05,368
The leader must've offered
a deal to Mr. Suraj..

977
01:34:05,639 --> 01:34:09,811
Making sure that his secrecy remains
intact and his isn't caught.

978
01:34:11,500 --> 01:34:14,861
Mr. Suraj murdered Mrs. Indrani..

979
01:34:15,283 --> 01:34:18,695
Saved the real culprit
from getting arrested.

980
01:34:18,982 --> 01:34:24,877
Mr. Suraj brutally murdered Mrs. Indrani
when she was in police custody.

981
01:34:25,096 --> 01:34:27,680
We cannot think of such
a case in the past.

982
01:34:28,221 --> 01:34:31,853
Hence, Mr. Suraj should
be punished mercilessly.

983
01:34:41,226 --> 01:34:45,348
Mom, you are crying!
I don't like it.

984
01:34:46,176 --> 01:34:51,649
What else can I do?
People used to felicitate you.

985
01:34:52,054 --> 01:34:55,551
But today, those people
want to hang you.

986
01:34:55,855 --> 01:34:58,666
- All this happened because of me.
- No, Poonam.

987
01:34:58,746 --> 01:35:00,634
This isn't because of you.

988
01:35:02,307 --> 01:35:07,392
I am having a doubt on
advocate Pran. We aren't enemies.

989
01:35:08,659 --> 01:35:12,003
But the way he placed the
case against me in the court..

990
01:35:12,544 --> 01:35:17,493
I feel he wants to get me
hanged to death. But why?

991
01:35:18,372 --> 01:35:21,581
No one apart from Pran and
me went to Mrs. Indrani.

992
01:35:21,817 --> 01:35:25,449
I am unable to understand what
Mr. Pran did to Mrs. Indrani.

993
01:35:27,493 --> 01:35:31,513
There are a few hours remaining and
the verdict might be against me.

994
01:35:31,593 --> 01:35:33,186
- Suraj.
- Yes, mom.

995
01:35:33,266 --> 01:35:34,988
Isn't it possible..

996
01:35:35,749 --> 01:35:39,190
That the court grants you a few days so
that you can capture the real culprit?

997
01:35:39,393 --> 01:35:42,781
No, mom. Now that's not possible.

998
01:35:43,338 --> 01:35:45,044
Then you should run away.

999
01:35:46,480 --> 01:35:48,592
What are you saying?

1000
01:35:48,672 --> 01:35:51,717
I am a policeman and you are asking
me to run away from the law.

1001
01:35:52,696 --> 01:35:54,284
Poonam is right.

1002
01:35:54,943 --> 01:35:56,879
If you a true policeman..

1003
01:35:57,301 --> 01:36:00,896
Then how come such a wrong
decision is being made by the law.

1004
01:36:01,548 --> 01:36:05,332
If you get jailed, the
culprits will roam freely.

1005
01:36:05,839 --> 01:36:07,849
Is this right for the law?

1006
01:36:08,120 --> 01:36:10,400
No, mom. I can't do this.

1007
01:36:10,480 --> 01:36:15,180
Instead of hiding like thieves,
I would stand tall and go to jail..

1008
01:36:15,260 --> 01:36:17,224
Or even get hanged.

1009
01:36:17,304 --> 01:36:20,138
If you accept your punishment
without being the culprit..

1010
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:22,955
Then neither can you stand
tall nor keep your head high.

1011
01:36:23,625 --> 01:36:27,156
It will be your defeat.
You should fight for justice.

1012
01:36:27,984 --> 01:36:32,359
If innocent people get punished, won't
be wrong on the part of the law?

1013
01:36:32,697 --> 01:36:35,247
The court hasn't declared
you as the culprit.

1014
01:36:35,605 --> 01:36:37,842
Call up your senior before leaving.

1015
01:36:37,967 --> 01:36:40,497
Tell him that if you are
unable to catch..

1016
01:36:40,670 --> 01:36:42,750
The culprit within 7 days
then you will surrender.

1017
01:36:45,763 --> 01:36:49,395
- This is possible.
- Suraj, this is not possible.

1018
01:36:49,475 --> 01:36:51,692
No. Its impossible.

1019
01:36:51,772 --> 01:36:56,287
Suraj! Suraj! Hello? Suraj!

1020
01:37:07,385 --> 01:37:08,635
Suraj.

1021
01:37:09,311 --> 01:37:13,280
Poonam, the police is
coming to arrest me.

1022
01:37:14,413 --> 01:37:17,741
- I'll leave.
- Where are you going alone?

1023
01:37:17,821 --> 01:37:20,258
We have promised to
be together always.

1024
01:37:20,578 --> 01:37:24,126
But the path is very difficult.

1025
01:37:24,649 --> 01:37:27,082
When we are together, all the
difficulties will ease out.

1026
01:37:52,942 --> 01:37:56,675
Today's fresh news!
Inspector Suraj is absconding!

1027
01:37:56,755 --> 01:37:59,158
Today's fresh news!
Today's fresh news!

1028
01:38:02,063 --> 01:38:06,438
Today's fresh news!
Inspector Suraj is absconding!

1029
01:38:07,384 --> 01:38:10,002
Impossible! Suraj is absconding.

1030
01:38:10,289 --> 01:38:11,506
- Jack.
- Yes, boss.

1031
01:38:11,586 --> 01:38:13,870
Make your men go to each and
every corner of the city.

1032
01:38:14,107 --> 01:38:16,134
Wherever they see
him, get him killed.

1033
01:38:16,674 --> 01:38:19,851
If he is alive, he will be
the reason of our death.

1034
01:38:38,855 --> 01:38:40,059
Search the area from all sides.

1035
01:38:40,083 --> 01:38:44,125
If he tries to run, shoot him! Go!

1036
01:38:57,385 --> 01:38:58,838
Did you find him?

1037
01:39:34,356 --> 01:39:35,748
Do you have matchsticks?

1038
01:40:05,531 --> 01:40:07,166
Who fired the bullet?

1039
01:40:08,058 --> 01:40:09,869
Oh! C'mon!

1040
01:40:24,774 --> 01:40:26,977
- What happened?
- There's firing going on.

1041
01:40:27,057 --> 01:40:28,657
I think the police has
come to arrest me.

1042
01:40:28,719 --> 01:40:30,004
Why will the police arrest you?

1043
01:40:30,084 --> 01:40:31,896
Open the door. Someone's outside.

1044
01:40:34,436 --> 01:40:37,233
- Inspector Suraj!
- He is shot.

1045
01:40:37,529 --> 01:40:39,597
I really need your help right now.

1046
01:40:39,677 --> 01:40:42,070
Surely. Take him inside.
I will close the door.

1047
01:40:46,083 --> 01:40:47,880
You shot him.
Yet he managed to escape.

1048
01:40:47,960 --> 01:40:49,123
What could we do, boss?

1049
01:40:49,448 --> 01:40:51,556
We would've caught him but
the police came there.

1050
01:40:51,907 --> 01:40:54,718
- That's why we had to move behind.
- Boss, a girl was with him.

1051
01:40:54,934 --> 01:40:58,529
- What?
- I think Mrs. Indrani's daughter, Poonam is with him.

1052
01:40:59,258 --> 01:41:01,339
I see. Poonam.

1053
01:41:32,570 --> 01:41:33,935
- Bullet.
- Bullet.

1054
01:41:45,529 --> 01:41:46,623
Open!

1055
01:41:48,299 --> 01:41:50,420
- Here he is.
- Here he is. Inspector Suraj.

1056
01:41:50,500 --> 01:41:54,271
Yes, this is inspector Suraj.

1057
01:41:54,474 --> 01:41:58,339
Now we will earn
Rs 50,000 immediately.

1058
01:41:58,419 --> 01:42:01,190
Our stars are shining.

1059
01:42:01,433 --> 01:42:04,420
Now tell us, inspector Suraj,
whether we are detectives or not.

1060
01:42:04,757 --> 01:42:06,676
- Where will he run now?
- Correct.

1061
01:42:06,756 --> 01:42:09,946
We will get him
arrested by the police.

1062
01:42:10,026 --> 01:42:13,446
You will get him arrested!
How will you do that?

1063
01:42:13,526 --> 01:42:15,905
He is anyway running
from the police.

1064
01:42:15,985 --> 01:42:19,405
He has murdered Mrs. Indrani.

1065
01:42:19,485 --> 01:42:22,959
You are wrong.
I did not murder Mrs. Indrani.

1066
01:42:23,311 --> 01:42:26,378
- Someone else has murdered her.
- Who has done that?

1067
01:42:27,527 --> 01:42:31,378
The same person who
tired to kill me today.

1068
01:42:32,190 --> 01:42:35,906
I ran away so that I can
capture the real culprit.

1069
01:42:36,486 --> 01:42:39,797
If you me help catch hold of
that dangerous culprit..

1070
01:42:40,256 --> 01:42:42,661
Then I will give away
Rs 50,000 to you.

1071
01:42:42,999 --> 01:42:46,053
After that you will be the most
famous detective agency in India.

1072
01:42:46,133 --> 01:42:48,621
You will also be get the money.

1073
01:42:48,877 --> 01:42:50,526
Is he making sense to you?

1074
01:42:50,606 --> 01:42:52,161
Well, we can think about it.

1075
01:42:52,241 --> 01:42:57,702
Big brother, you decide whether
to catch inspector Suraj..

1076
01:42:57,782 --> 01:42:59,701
Or the real culprit.

1077
01:42:59,781 --> 01:43:01,890
Ideally, we should catch
the real culprit.

1078
01:43:02,282 --> 01:43:06,147
Inspector, I hope you will
give us the winning amount.

1079
01:43:06,432 --> 01:43:09,580
I will. I just want
to catch the culprit.

1080
01:43:10,283 --> 01:43:12,121
You will get the amount.

1081
01:43:15,946 --> 01:43:18,540
- So, do you take the charge.
- Yes, I do.

1082
01:43:18,620 --> 01:43:19,797
- Promise?
- Yes.

1083
01:43:19,877 --> 01:43:22,189
Hey, we have said you will get the amount.

1084
01:43:23,284 --> 01:43:25,770
Now we will surely
catch the culprit.

1085
01:43:25,850 --> 01:43:28,054
- I will surely go to him today.
- Whom?

1086
01:43:28,959 --> 01:43:30,580
The one I doubt.

1087
01:43:57,932 --> 01:43:59,459
- Jack.
- Yes, boss.

1088
01:43:59,539 --> 01:44:02,432
- Our car has been recognised.
- Who did that?

1089
01:44:02,864 --> 01:44:04,499
There are some stupid people.

1090
01:44:04,579 --> 01:44:06,122
Now they will surely come here.

1091
01:44:06,527 --> 01:44:08,243
Arrange for their welcome.

1092
01:44:08,986 --> 01:44:10,189
Yes, boss.

1093
01:44:10,527 --> 01:44:12,203
- Helen.
- Yes, boss?

1094
01:44:13,459 --> 01:44:14,729
Take the keys.

1095
01:44:14,809 --> 01:44:18,162
- Take this car and throw it off some cliff.
- Okay.

1096
01:44:19,730 --> 01:44:22,838
Boss, what have you found
out about inspector Suraj?

1097
01:44:24,202 --> 01:44:25,378
I am sorry.

1098
01:44:40,717 --> 01:44:46,730
"Your thin waistline,
your sharp eyes.."

1099
01:44:46,947 --> 01:44:49,920
"Your curvaceous neck."

1100
01:44:50,109 --> 01:44:54,730
"O darling! You are such a beauty."

1101
01:45:07,771 --> 01:45:08,825
'Poonam, I...'

1102
01:45:10,055 --> 01:45:13,623
'Oh wow! I am scared of your eyes.'

1103
01:45:25,055 --> 01:45:28,960
"Why am I accused that I
have fallen in love?"

1104
01:45:29,040 --> 01:45:36,500
"I have always prayed
and worshipped you."

1105
01:46:08,081 --> 01:46:09,081
Suraj!

1106
01:46:22,623 --> 01:46:26,123
- Oh Suraj!
- You shameless woman!

1107
01:46:26,352 --> 01:46:27,974
I will kill you.

1108
01:46:28,054 --> 01:46:30,623
You think you will
succeed in your moves.

1109
01:46:30,703 --> 01:46:33,015
- What are you saying, Suraj?
- I am right.

1110
01:46:33,095 --> 01:46:35,528
You want to kill me and
take a revenge on me.

1111
01:46:35,608 --> 01:46:39,217
No, Suraj. Don't accuse
me of such a thing.

1112
01:46:39,297 --> 01:46:42,204
I am telling the truth. I didn't
know that you were in that car.

1113
01:46:42,284 --> 01:46:43,691
You are lying.

1114
01:46:43,920 --> 01:46:46,164
You are one of them
who want to kill me.

1115
01:46:46,379 --> 01:46:48,852
Instead of saying so much,
why don't you just kill me?

1116
01:46:48,932 --> 01:46:51,285
I am with them because
of my helplessness.

1117
01:46:51,852 --> 01:46:53,555
But I am not your enemy.

1118
01:46:53,635 --> 01:46:56,812
Suraj, you betrayed my trust
when you were disguised as Robby.

1119
01:46:56,892 --> 01:46:59,217
But I did not complain about it.

1120
01:46:59,297 --> 01:47:02,514
In fact, I was happy to know
that you are a good person.

1121
01:47:02,893 --> 01:47:04,785
I won't listen to
such things anymore.

1122
01:47:05,069 --> 01:47:07,420
You are pretending to love
me just to save your life.

1123
01:47:08,083 --> 01:47:11,651
No, Suraj. My destiny has
been pretentious with me.

1124
01:47:11,731 --> 01:47:13,894
And I can die for that.

1125
01:47:14,367 --> 01:47:17,191
Look, I was killing the pretence.

1126
01:47:17,556 --> 01:47:20,570
- Do you believe me now?
- Absolutely not.

1127
01:47:21,421 --> 01:47:22,489
Alright then.

1128
01:47:24,152 --> 01:47:26,436
Go ahead, push me down the cliff.

1129
01:47:29,341 --> 01:47:32,746
Throw me off from here
and finish me off.

1130
01:47:33,584 --> 01:47:36,111
Come and finish me.

1131
01:47:38,314 --> 01:47:40,436
I will not be able to
die a better death.

1132
01:47:41,543 --> 01:47:44,016
What are you looking at? Push me.

1133
01:47:51,098 --> 01:47:54,071
Suraj, I too belong
to a good family.

1134
01:47:54,625 --> 01:47:56,638
They are no more with me.

1135
01:47:57,016 --> 01:47:58,868
I have young brothers and sisters.

1136
01:47:58,948 --> 01:48:01,557
I am trying to make them
better human beings.

1137
01:48:02,193 --> 01:48:04,977
I got involved with them
so that I could help them.

1138
01:48:05,679 --> 01:48:09,422
But today, I swear on my
brothers and sisters.

1139
01:48:09,653 --> 01:48:11,436
I am not your enemy.

1140
01:48:11,639 --> 01:48:16,004
When I found you, I thought I
have got everything in life.

1141
01:48:16,747 --> 01:48:18,531
But I am ill-fated.

1142
01:48:19,018 --> 01:48:23,112
- Suraj, you are nothing but a heartless policeman.
- What?

1143
01:48:24,909 --> 01:48:26,787
Policemen also have a heart, Helen.

1144
01:48:27,449 --> 01:48:30,233
But they are usually more
concerned about their duty.

1145
01:48:30,827 --> 01:48:32,435
Helen, I think you don't know.

1146
01:48:32,665 --> 01:48:35,611
Advocate Pran has accused me
for Mrs. Indrani's murder.

1147
01:48:36,138 --> 01:48:37,570
Yes, Suraj.

1148
01:48:38,016 --> 01:48:40,416
But without proper evidence,
the court won't decide anything.

1149
01:48:41,205 --> 01:48:44,016
I would've never escaped had
this been my personal matter.

1150
01:48:44,327 --> 01:48:46,847
But if I am jailed, it will prove
to be an achievement for them.

1151
01:48:47,110 --> 01:48:48,990
They are enemies of our
country and our society.

1152
01:48:49,043 --> 01:48:51,178
No, Suraj. That won't happen.

1153
01:48:51,502 --> 01:48:55,327
Helen, if I am unable to present
evidence of me being innocent..

1154
01:48:55,840 --> 01:48:57,908
Then I will surrender.

1155
01:48:58,718 --> 01:49:00,597
I wish you would've used me.

1156
01:49:01,394 --> 01:49:04,232
I can still help you
catch advocate Pran.

1157
01:49:05,259 --> 01:49:06,975
Even if I die.

1158
01:49:10,557 --> 01:49:13,841
I found the clue. The car
has just left from here.

1159
01:49:32,597 --> 01:49:35,868
The woman I was talking about,
her room is somewhere this side.

1160
01:49:36,381 --> 01:49:38,327
You should leave from
the bigger corridor.

1161
01:49:38,407 --> 01:49:40,354
- What about advocate Pran?
- Pran...

1162
01:49:40,746 --> 01:49:43,502
Don't worry about him.
I will keep him busy.

1163
01:49:43,582 --> 01:49:46,610
- Okay?
- Helen, I am not a bad guy.

1164
01:49:47,489 --> 01:49:49,787
I know that I have hurt you a lot.

1165
01:49:50,165 --> 01:49:53,516
But I did all this
to find the truth.

1166
01:49:53,868 --> 01:49:59,247
- If you have any complaints...
- No, Suraj. I have no complaints.

1167
01:49:59,746 --> 01:50:04,084
My love for you has taught
me to live and die.

1168
01:50:04,719 --> 01:50:11,097
I am helping you so that righteousness
and truthfulness are alive.

1169
01:50:11,990 --> 01:50:13,273
Best of luck.

1170
01:50:13,990 --> 01:50:16,503
- Is there any message from Hong Kong?
- Yes, boss.

1171
01:50:16,976 --> 01:50:20,273
Mr. Wilkrof has asked how
much more gold we need.

1172
01:50:21,016 --> 01:50:24,597
Send a reply asking him to
send as much gold as he can.

1173
01:50:25,030 --> 01:50:26,665
Now all we want is gold.

1174
01:50:27,097 --> 01:50:30,273
Excuse me, boss. Our plane
was caught recently.

1175
01:50:31,070 --> 01:50:33,124
Moreover, even Suraj is alive.

1176
01:50:33,530 --> 01:50:36,935
Suraj! I have got Suraj killed.

1177
01:50:37,286 --> 01:50:38,732
- Boss?
- Yes.

1178
01:50:39,408 --> 01:50:42,354
The car that Helen took
to throw off the cliff..

1179
01:50:42,922 --> 01:50:45,138
Suraj was trapped in
the rear of that car.

1180
01:50:45,759 --> 01:50:48,435
Really, boss. In that
case, I am really happy.

1181
01:50:48,515 --> 01:50:52,624
I pushed the car off the cliff
from such a height that..

1182
01:50:52,908 --> 01:50:54,705
I am sure Suraj is dead.

1183
01:50:54,785 --> 01:50:56,165
Well done.

1184
01:50:56,435 --> 01:50:57,827
- Jack.
- Yes, boss.

1185
01:50:58,043 --> 01:50:59,854
Go to the warehouse..

1186
01:51:00,206 --> 01:51:02,871
Melt all the gold in it and clean
the logos of other countries.

1187
01:51:02,959 --> 01:51:03,959
Yes, boss.

1188
01:51:04,664 --> 01:51:07,178
- Darling, what about my reward?
- Yes.

1189
01:51:07,258 --> 01:51:09,124
Today, you have done a
very important work.

1190
01:51:09,204 --> 01:51:12,691
- Come.
- Not that side. Today, we will go this side.

1191
01:51:12,935 --> 01:51:16,489
Is it? Let's go. Today's I
will dance in to your tunes.

1192
01:51:34,529 --> 01:51:37,664
Yes? Jack, what is it?

1193
01:51:38,313 --> 01:51:42,597
The work is on but if you
come once, it would be great.

1194
01:51:42,948 --> 01:51:44,637
You keep it going. I am coming.

1195
01:51:45,624 --> 01:51:46,759
Darling.

1196
01:51:49,016 --> 01:51:50,976
Listen, I am coming after sometime.

1197
01:52:08,718 --> 01:52:12,110
- He is here! Our hero is here.
- Who?

1198
01:52:17,460 --> 01:52:21,042
Sir, the great detectives of India
are captured because of you.

1199
01:52:21,122 --> 01:52:23,123
- Release us.
- Release us.

1200
01:52:23,434 --> 01:52:26,744
Stay here. I will
try to get you out.

1201
01:52:27,123 --> 01:52:30,488
- Here, drink some. Drink.
- Me? No.

1202
01:52:41,083 --> 01:52:45,056
- Yes?
- Hello, boss. The work is on.

1203
01:52:45,855 --> 01:52:48,246
But it is important
for you to come once.

1204
01:52:48,326 --> 01:52:49,882
Yes, I am coming.

1205
01:52:51,341 --> 01:52:53,044
Will you leave me
alone and go away?

1206
01:52:54,922 --> 01:52:57,557
- No.
- Okay. Take this.

1207
01:55:22,802 --> 01:55:27,666
Don't move. I know that you
make the poisonous nail.

1208
01:55:27,937 --> 01:55:29,978
It was used to kill Mrs. Indrani.

1209
01:55:30,058 --> 01:55:31,886
You will have to come to the
police station with me.

1210
01:55:31,910 --> 01:55:33,099
- Police station?
- Yes.

1211
01:55:33,179 --> 01:55:37,544
You will have to reveal how
you make them. Don't try to run.

1212
01:55:38,085 --> 01:55:40,234
Come with me. C'mon!

1213
01:55:46,935 --> 01:55:50,476
Why did you stop?
I can kill you here as well.

1214
01:55:51,368 --> 01:55:55,273
But I won't because you are the
evidence that will prove me innocent.

1215
01:55:56,218 --> 01:55:57,380
Move!

1216
01:56:02,042 --> 01:56:04,191
What is this? Move faster!

1217
01:56:08,205 --> 01:56:10,543
What happened? What is it?

1218
01:56:11,205 --> 01:56:12,462
What happened?

1219
01:56:16,232 --> 01:56:20,205
The poisonous nail. You can't die.
You have to stay alive.

1220
01:56:20,421 --> 01:56:21,813
Yes, I am coming.

1221
01:56:22,462 --> 01:56:25,624
- Darling, I have to go now.
- Not now, darling.

1222
01:56:25,813 --> 01:56:28,394
It is a very important work.
Come with me.

1223
01:56:36,867 --> 01:56:42,123
"I am truly and deeply in love."

1224
01:56:42,203 --> 01:56:47,434
"What can I complain about to him?"

1225
01:56:47,691 --> 01:56:52,839
"I am truly and deeply in love."

1226
01:56:53,097 --> 01:56:58,272
"What can I complain about to him?"

1227
01:56:58,475 --> 01:57:06,475
"The thing I wanted to say, I am
sure would be a prayer for you."

1228
01:57:09,178 --> 01:57:14,610
"I am truly and deeply in love."

1229
01:57:46,216 --> 01:57:54,216
"How can I complain to him
about his unfaithfulness?"

1230
01:57:56,554 --> 01:58:04,554
"How can I complain to him
about his unfaithfulness?"

1231
01:58:06,581 --> 01:58:14,581
"The ones who pretend of
being faithful in love."

1232
01:58:16,540 --> 01:58:21,540
"If he happens to feel
offended with me.."

1233
01:58:21,620 --> 01:58:26,796
"Then I am sure it
will be my mistake."

1234
01:58:26,876 --> 01:58:34,876
"The thing I wanted to say, I am
sure would be a prayer for you."

1235
01:58:37,431 --> 01:58:44,202
"I am truly and deeply in love."

1236
01:59:08,540 --> 01:59:16,540
"The one who dies
when truly in love..."

1237
01:59:18,810 --> 01:59:26,810
"The one who dies
when truly in love..."

1238
01:59:28,783 --> 01:59:36,783
"Even after dying he lives
in the heart of lovers."

1239
01:59:38,809 --> 01:59:43,809
"I wonder if there is a court.."

1240
01:59:43,889 --> 01:59:49,120
"Where someone is
punished like this."

1241
01:59:49,200 --> 01:59:54,443
"I am truly and deeply in love."

1242
01:59:54,523 --> 01:59:59,727
"What can I complain about to him?"

1243
01:59:59,943 --> 02:00:07,943
"The thing I wanted to say, I am
sure would be a prayer for you."

1244
02:00:10,415 --> 02:00:16,983
"I am truly and deeply in love."

1245
02:00:17,780 --> 02:00:22,578
Boss! Boss! Boss! Boss!

1246
02:00:26,564 --> 02:00:28,645
What happened?
What happened to you?

1247
02:00:29,982 --> 02:00:32,226
Boss, Suraj.

1248
02:00:32,577 --> 02:00:34,698
Suraj!

1249
02:01:34,008 --> 02:01:35,697
- Jack!
- Yes, boss.

1250
02:01:35,777 --> 02:01:38,467
Start loading all the
gold in the truck.

1251
02:01:38,778 --> 02:01:41,291
The gold that is not melted,
there's no need to do it.

1252
02:01:41,521 --> 02:01:45,291
- We don't have time. We should leave this place immediately. Okay?
- Yes!

1253
02:02:32,927 --> 02:02:35,386
Where are you running away
with my money, partner?

1254
02:02:35,738 --> 02:02:38,886
You? You?

1255
02:02:40,265 --> 02:02:43,265
You are dead. You are dead.

1256
02:02:43,535 --> 02:02:45,697
The law is very powerful.

1257
02:02:46,008 --> 02:02:49,738
You wanted to kill me. The
police wanted to keep me alive.

1258
02:02:50,400 --> 02:02:55,359
- I am alive.
- You are alive. That's great. It really is.

1259
02:02:56,089 --> 02:02:58,981
Yes, its true that I am alive.

1260
02:02:59,791 --> 02:03:02,007
Now I know your reality.

1261
02:03:02,736 --> 02:03:08,331
I wish I learnt about it when you
forced me to marry Mr. Raj Kishor.

1262
02:03:08,411 --> 02:03:11,290
You killed my husband
in front of my eyes.

1263
02:03:11,370 --> 02:03:13,669
I appreciate your target.

1264
02:03:14,209 --> 02:03:18,696
Because of your orders,
I killed so many innocent people.

1265
02:03:19,114 --> 02:03:24,276
Widowed women and orphaned
kids would appeal to me.

1266
02:03:24,356 --> 02:03:26,303
But I closed my ears.

1267
02:03:26,383 --> 02:03:29,560
You are responsible
for those crimes.

1268
02:03:29,884 --> 02:03:31,871
I gave away all of
Poonam's wealth to you.

1269
02:03:32,709 --> 02:03:35,884
I did so because I
thought you are mine.

1270
02:03:36,289 --> 02:03:38,546
It was such huge mistake I made.

1271
02:03:38,748 --> 02:03:40,860
You got scared after my arrest that..

1272
02:03:40,940 --> 02:03:43,435
I would reveal your
secrets to the police.

1273
02:03:43,614 --> 02:03:46,289
No. No. I did not kill you.

1274
02:03:46,369 --> 02:03:48,276
Don't lie, Mr. Pran.

1275
02:03:48,356 --> 02:03:50,857
All your lies have been revealed.

1276
02:03:50,937 --> 02:03:54,141
All the crimes you committed
will result to your death.

1277
02:03:54,965 --> 02:03:56,302
How can I kill you, darling?

1278
02:03:56,382 --> 02:03:59,492
Darling! You still have the
audacity to call me like that.

1279
02:04:00,573 --> 02:04:03,141
- Tell me, did you kill me or not?
- No.

1280
02:04:04,249 --> 02:04:06,898
No? I will tell you.

1281
02:04:07,452 --> 02:04:10,547
Wasn't this the nail?
This was the one, right?

1282
02:04:10,627 --> 02:04:12,722
I too will kill you with this nail.

1283
02:04:12,802 --> 02:04:14,938
I will murder you with this nail.

1284
02:04:15,018 --> 02:04:18,843
- Tell me, did you kill me or not?
- Yes! I killed you.

1285
02:04:19,059 --> 02:04:20,492
Move it away!

1286
02:04:22,302 --> 02:04:24,965
Did you recognise me, Mr. Pran?
I am Poonam.

1287
02:04:25,370 --> 02:04:26,992
- There he is!
- Arrest him!

1288
02:04:29,613 --> 02:04:31,329
Sir, I'll follow him.

1289
02:04:31,409 --> 02:04:33,788
Go and release those detectives.
Quick!

1290
02:06:05,794 --> 02:06:07,294
Oh my God! What is that?

1291
02:08:27,617 --> 02:08:29,036
Come here. Come here.

1292
02:08:33,455 --> 02:08:36,495
Big brother, save me. Save me!
Save me!

1293
02:09:05,639 --> 02:09:06,922
Stop!

1294
02:11:23,438 --> 02:11:24,506
I am proud of Suraj.

1295
02:11:26,384 --> 02:11:28,681
- Mom! Mom!
- Suraj.

1296
02:11:29,118 --> 02:11:32,199
You definitely did commit a crime
by running away from the law.

1297
02:11:32,388 --> 02:11:35,496
It is quite possible that you
will get punished for it.

1298
02:11:35,794 --> 02:11:38,496
Even then I would like
to congratulate you.

1299
02:11:38,902 --> 02:11:42,402
I pray that every mother in our
country gets a son like yours.

1300
02:11:43,030 --> 02:11:46,625
The one who does good
and finishes the bad.

1301
02:11:46,705 --> 02:11:49,152
Sir, this has been possible
because of my mother.

1302
02:11:50,463 --> 02:11:53,719
- Suraj, you need to do another thing.
- What's that?

1303
02:11:55,350 --> 02:11:56,715
Poonam.

1304
02:12:01,390 --> 02:12:08,336
"The one who loves you in this
world made by the almighty.."

1305
02:12:08,416 --> 02:12:13,931
"I hope no one loves
you more than I do."
