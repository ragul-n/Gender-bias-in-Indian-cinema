196
00:17:47,826 --> 00:17:52,339
given them riches, and
he has forgotten.

197
00:17:52,442 --> 00:17:58,451
-No god has given it.
We have toiled and given them bunglows

198
00:17:59,296 --> 00:18:02,950
What has happened brother,
leave it?

199
00:18:03,471 --> 00:18:06,219
Simply Sit and do the 'Bhajan' (Prayer).

200
00:18:06,219 --> 00:18:10,140
If you want, take heroin and have fun.

201
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:16,764
Who knows, you may feel like in sky.
May be, even heaven.

00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:28,775

-See that guy? Shall we race with him?
-I'm ready.

208
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:08,787
Are you practicing bike race?

209
00:21:09,836 --> 00:21:14,300
That is a Child;s play. I
didn't get the sleep, so I'm

210
00:21:14,326 --> 00:21:18,871
riding my horse. -No matter,
you have a good experience.

211
00:21:19,446 --> 00:21:22,579
Speed man, speed.
My life is full of speed.

212
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,915
You want some tablets?

213
00:21:25,524 --> 00:21:27,955
No, we have had enough.
Should finish the beer.

214
00:21:28,455 --> 00:21:31,123
Come on Deepak, Take it.

215
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:35,562
Another Round of racing?

216
00:21:36,162 --> 00:21:39,443
My horse is feeling sleepy.

217
00:21:47,763 --> 00:21:49,716
Okay, lets go.

218
00:23:29,876 --> 00:23:32,279
Deepak.... Deepak

219
00:23:55,502 --> 00:23:58,547
STOP IT...

220
00:24:32,564 --> 00:24:35,028
It's shameful that you are crying.

221
00:24:39,059 --> 00:24:41,139
Help me, Damn it.

222
00:24:44,659 --> 00:24:48,254
Why are you looking like that?

223
00:24:51,958 --> 00:24:53,160
What happened to the car?

224
00:24:53,844 --> 00:24:57,011
A donkey like you came in between.

225
00:24:57,364 --> 00:24:58,612
Bring that tyre.
You wash.

226
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:18,707
Everything is fine,
Pinto will lookafter the rest.

227
00:25:18,984 --> 00:25:21,620
Keep up the tyre.

228
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:23,826
Go make some tea.

229
00:25:28,115 --> 00:25:31,028
Go change your dress.

230
00:25:32,819 --> 00:25:35,251
-Dasappa,
-What sir?

231
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:42,308
What happened till now?

232
00:25:46,739 --> 00:25:49,196
You didn't see anything till now.
Got it?

233
00:25:49,322 --> 00:25:51,699
Dad should not
come to know this.

234
00:26:00,984 --> 00:26:03,280
Why man? Don't worry.

235
00:26:03,306 --> 00:26:06,233
Pinto will get things right.

236
00:26:11,037 --> 00:26:14,040
Why are you moody?

237
00:26:14,617 --> 00:26:17,043
It's already Morning.

238
00:26:17,442 --> 00:26:22,450
Oh... See the bloodshed.

239
00:26:43,378 --> 00:26:48,968
At what time this happened?
Wasn't the patrol there?

240
00:27:06,392 --> 00:27:06,993
4 foot.

241
00:27:48,487 --> 00:27:54,151
At what time the accident happened?
Where are you from?

242
00:28:05,852 --> 00:28:09,366
-We are from the Press.
-Don't get angry.

243
00:28:13,659 --> 00:28:17,263
Please understand.
Inspection is going on.

244
00:28:20,265 --> 00:28:21,535
Okay Inspector.

245
00:28:21,561 --> 00:28:25,939
But we will also look at
the spot after it's over.

246
00:28:26,484 --> 00:28:28,908
-Sure, we have that same interest.
-Thank You

247
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:35,347
Send a Ambulance to the spot
Damn it.

248
00:28:41,396 --> 00:28:43,730
-Which vehicle would it be?

249
00:28:44,313 --> 00:28:47,222
-It looks like a Lorry.

250
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:50,883
Calm Down, We will

251
00:28:50,909 --> 00:28:54,726
look after everything.

252
00:28:55,285 --> 00:28:59,905
-Dorai, what are you doing?
-The vehicle has dashed here.

253
00:29:04,711 --> 00:29:11,955
-See sir.
-Sent these to forensic department.

254
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:16,262
Shut, I will have to handle this case.

255
00:29:17,331 --> 00:29:21,716
-Rao, where are you going?
-You can go and watch.

256
00:29:22,161 --> 00:29:24,378
-We have some questions.
-Go on.

257
00:29:24,477 --> 00:29:26,806
-How did this happen?
-No idea till the report comes.

258
00:29:27,828 --> 00:29:34,540
-Was it done deliberately?
-Not sure, there are no evidences.

259
00:29:36,342 --> 00:29:40,787
-Oh press reporters.
-Inspector, it looks like a Buldozer?

260
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:46,009
-Surely, not a Buldozer.
-So, Is it a car or van?

261
00:29:46,643 --> 00:29:49,659
- Can't answer till the report
- Thank You.

262
00:29:52,275 --> 00:29:56,306
See Ravi, the investigation is going on.
I can't make guesses here.

263
00:29:56,791 --> 00:30:02,098
You press do guess work.
We police do investigation.

264
00:30:02,098 --> 00:30:04,812
How many years will
investigation take?

265
00:30:05,714 --> 00:30:09,674
We are humans too.
Don't ask stupid questions.

266
00:30:10,426 --> 00:30:16,021
One last question.
How many are killed in the Accident?

267
00:30:16,282 --> 00:30:18,463
2 men, 1 woman and a child.

268
00:30:18,663 --> 00:30:21,686
I've seen more than 9

269
00:30:21,428 --> 00:30:23,507
- I'm sorry, you go and check
-Thank You.

270
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:38,452
-Rao, any exclusive
information for me?

271
00:30:38,478 --> 00:30:42,932
-Looks like a Car.
-Can't Say Rao

272
00:30:52,819 --> 00:30:57,715
-Okay, see you
-I'll meet you at the station sir.

273
00:31:07,433 --> 00:31:16,339
-Ravi, hot news. Government fell
-Oh my God.

274
00:31:16,819 --> 00:31:21,487
-They have called a press meet.
-Wait, i'll bring the camera.

275
00:31:23,731 --> 00:31:27,284
Shut, Whats happening in this Country?
No one understands.

276
00:31:28,354 --> 00:31:32,052
I have to submit the
accident report by today.

277
00:31:32,582 --> 00:31:37,925
-Why do you need that revolver?
-This is not mine.

278
00:31:38,291 --> 00:31:44,769
I'm righting a article on
the easy availability of weapons.

279
00:31:45,369 --> 00:31:51,920
-What you write, what you do...
-See Paul, these Governments are falling...

280
00:31:56,500 --> 00:32:04,307
Days of gundays ruling
the country is not far!

281
00:32:04,883 --> 00:32:09,395
You write all these,
and send to the CPI party.

282
00:32:45,491 --> 00:32:48,403
-Hi Boss, how is your girl?
-She is busy Pinto.

283
00:32:49,747 --> 00:32:52,438
Come, lets Inspect.

284
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:59,646
A buffalo come across, tried to escape.
It hit the telephone pole.

285
00:32:58,739 --> 00:32:59,827
Should be repaired urgently Pinto.

286
00:33:07,411 --> 00:33:11,857
-Looks like a strong Buffalo.
-The pole was strong, not the buffalo.

287
00:33:13,715 --> 00:33:15,635
I got it.

288
00:33:15,539 --> 00:33:17,491
So what should  i do Boss?

289
00:33:17,864 --> 00:33:21,779
It's very urgent Pinto,
I want it tomorrow.

290
00:33:22,259 --> 00:33:25,770
-I'm very busy.
-Please Pinto.

291
00:33:25,171 --> 00:33:26,371
Okay Sir.

292
00:33:27,636 --> 00:33:30,068
I want it before Daddy comes Pinto.

293
00:33:30,475 --> 00:33:33,880
-Okay sir - No one should
get to know, including dad

294
00:33:37,906 --> 00:33:41,330
Rahul...
So how is the second business Pinto?

295
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:43,588
-Any new Video?
-All that you have seen boss.

296
00:33:44,371 --> 00:33:47,193
Come next week,

297
00:33:47,988 --> 00:33:49,596
-Dont forget for tomorrow
-Okay Boss

298
00:34:16,627 --> 00:34:20,308
-See sir, the cheif guest is back
-Greetings sir.

299
00:34:21,491 --> 00:34:24,690
Isn't your home good for you?

300
00:34:34,355 --> 00:34:38,845
They have caught me illegally sir.

301
00:34:46,675 --> 00:34:51,571
Why do you all have this
hatredness on me?

302
00:34:52,657 --> 00:34:55,661
Where is the money
from Pick-pocketings?

303
00:34:58,291 --> 00:35:02,579
You are making me a robber?

304
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:07,346
Come, i'll show you Airplane.

305
00:35:09,522 --> 00:35:14,418
Rao sir, did i miss a good scene here?

306
00:35:17,883 --> 00:35:20,531
Gowda, bring two glasses.

307
00:35:20,885 --> 00:35:23,589
So, what does the newspapers say?

308
00:35:33,299 --> 00:35:35,827
Hey mister, come back.
Aren't you seeing the signal?

309
00:36:32,458 --> 00:36:37,811
Ravi, meet Dr.Gowda.

310
00:36:38,164 --> 00:36:39,091
Dr. How is rammanna?

311
00:36:39,571 --> 00:36:42,367
Not critical to his life.
Small injuries thats yet.

312
00:36:42,969 --> 00:36:46,572
He is in the shock.
Other 4 might not make it.

313
00:36:46,803 --> 00:36:50,313
-Doctor, how many have
lost life till now?

314
00:36:50,339 --> 00:36:53,604
-Including these 4,
it is About 1.....

315
00:36:57,299 --> 00:37:02,419
Doc, Ramanna is very important.
He is required to identify bodies.

316
00:37:02,931 --> 00:37:09,095
He should be in ICU for another 4 days.

317
00:37:10,994 --> 00:37:12,496
Who is he?

318
00:37:12,522 --> 00:37:18,529
That accident victim, another gone.
12 in total.

319
00:37:40,563 --> 00:37:42,259
No...

320
00:37:43,603 --> 00:37:48,534
Yama is coming, leave the way.

321
00:37:48,787 --> 00:37:51,731
My chenna, where are you...

322
00:37:52,137 --> 00:37:55,348
-Everybody is gone...God...

323
00:37:58,144 --> 00:38:03,681
-Sister, sedative
-Please leave the path.

324
00:38:21,043 --> 00:38:27,539
Ramanna is to be kept in sedation.
I think he has lost his kith and kins.

325
00:38:28,072 --> 00:38:32,278
-Still how many days doctor?
-Another three or four days.

326
00:38:37,804 --> 00:38:43,689
-I dont think you got any news here
-I got a good news sir.

327
00:38:43,961 --> 00:38:48,493
I got to know that 12 are dead.

328
00:38:46,356 --> 00:38:52,877
But Rao, how many
have really dead?

329
00:38:52,903 --> 00:38:57,587
12...14....15...18....???

330
00:39:00,531 --> 00:39:03,826
I'm not going towards the station
Should i drop you anywhere?

331
00:39:03,008 --> 00:39:07,213
No problem, i'll get an auto rickshaw.

332
00:39:09,266 --> 00:39:13,164
I'm very much interested in this case.
When shall i come?

333
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:15,314
- Wait for the forensic report.

334
00:39:17,683 --> 00:39:23,538
Imported Vehicle. I've been testing
the headlight glass pieces.

335
00:39:23,985 --> 00:39:28,834
Quality confirms the vehicle
to be an imported vehicle.

336
00:39:29,092 --> 00:39:33,395
The viper is also an imported one.
Have a check.

337
00:39:33,858 --> 00:39:39,461
Due to the smudges,
can't say the make of the vehicle.

338
00:39:56,307 --> 00:40:01,366
Why Pinto? Not in mood?

339
00:40:02,707 --> 00:40:04,370
Has business gone down?

340
00:40:04,979 --> 00:40:08,573
-Which business?
-Vehicle Business Pinto.

341
00:40:19,762 --> 00:40:22,675
-Vehicle is good, which model Pinto?
-Duke

342
00:40:21,785 --> 00:40:25,391
I like these cars.
Maintained well.

343
00:40:26,291 --> 00:40:31,411
My car should be in good condition.
Nice and clean.

344
00:40:33,267 --> 00:40:35,283
So, Pinto gets speacial tips.

345
00:40:37,459 --> 00:40:42,354
These type of cars will
definitely need a special tips.

346
00:40:42,836 --> 00:40:47,613
You travel a lot in this vehicle?
Tyres have weared.

347
00:40:48,814 --> 00:40:54,820
-That tyre? Should be changed.
Pinto look at this next time.

348
00:40:57,223 --> 00:40:58,132
Excuse Me

349
00:41:01,651 --> 00:41:03,859
Where is the viper?

350
00:41:06,231 --> 00:41:11,060
Who uses viper?
No one uses open car in rainy days.

351
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:18,898
-Come in sir
-Pinto, how is business?

352
00:41:19,123 --> 00:41:22,067
No one wants these repair business.

353
00:41:22,447 --> 00:41:29,055
You know why i've come here?
One big white car.

354
00:41:29,876 --> 00:41:33,259
with scraped side. Did any car
like that come here?

355
00:41:33,428 --> 00:41:37,463
No car like that came here.
One car is there, but it's Moris

356
00:41:38,063 --> 00:41:42,266
This one has scraped,
but is red in color.

357
00:41:42,868 --> 00:41:46,972
-No other car has come.
-Where was the car which went...

358
00:41:47,603 --> 00:41:51,777
dented? - It was not dented,
 it had a wiring problem.

359
00:41:52,378 --> 00:41:54,345
Very intelligent Pinto.

360
00:41:54,371 --> 00:41:58,989
At Night times, many car
stand at your garage right?

361
00:41:59,956 --> 00:42:03,731
-How is night business?

362
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:08,372
I dont do such business Boss.
I'm very clean.

363
00:42:10,095 --> 00:42:11,921
