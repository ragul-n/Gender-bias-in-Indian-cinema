1
00:02:04,533 --> 00:02:09,533
"In memory of my father who is still
there with me spreading light in my path"

2
00:02:17,433 --> 00:02:22,433
"These are the people who are no
more and I follow their footsteps"

3
00:02:29,267 --> 00:02:34,717
"Daily in my prayer I think of you"

4
00:02:53,567 --> 00:02:56,173
God, bless all of us!

5
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:02,309
- Come, dear!
- Mother, father's scooter is here

6
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,971
- He seems to have come early
- Where is ghee?

7
00:03:05,067 --> 00:03:06,273
Father!

8
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,746
Yes, did you go to
temple on your birthday?

9
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,476
Thinking that you won't be there
for lunch, I decided not to have a feast

10
00:03:15,533 --> 00:03:18,207
That is no excuse
On birthday feast is a must

11
00:03:18,267 --> 00:03:19,712
- Isn't it, dear?
- Yes

12
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,144
What is wrong if we
keep the feast for dinner?

13
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,613
Otherwise also now everyone is
celebrating birthday as dinner

14
00:03:25,667 --> 00:03:28,204
I have made Aviyal,
kichadi, vermicelli

15
00:03:28,267 --> 00:03:29,405
Everything is ready

16
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,174
In between social work I should
do household work also

17
00:03:32,233 --> 00:03:35,510
God! At least today you
thought about your house

18
00:03:35,567 --> 00:03:37,478
Give that to me
I'll do the rest

19
00:03:37,567 --> 00:03:40,548
You go and have bath, Vinayetta
By then the rest of the dishes will be ready

20
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,738
- Vinayetta!
- Yes

21
00:03:43,667 --> 00:03:46,546
Is it George?
Why have you come at this time?

22
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,580
There is an urgent issue, Venayetta

23
00:03:48,667 --> 00:03:53,639
- What are you doing?
- Mother, give me a glass of payasam

24
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:56,980
First you eat feast
Then you can have payasam

25
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,644
Where are you going?
Who was that who came?

26
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:02,271
I'll tell you everything
I need to go somewhere urgently

27
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:05,212
- This is too much
- You serve food by then I'll return

28
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:14,778
<i>- How much'?
- Rs 25</i>

29
00:04:16,433 --> 00:04:18,208
- Come
- Where is the guy?

30
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:21,440
He is there
Come, Vinayetta

31
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,480
You don't worry for anything

32
00:04:23,533 --> 00:04:27,276
The God who sent us in this world
will show us the path and life

33
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:30,439
Think everything positively and
then everything will take place well

34
00:04:30,533 --> 00:04:31,671
Boss!

35
00:04:36,733 --> 00:04:38,235
Com e, come

36
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,302
I have a guest here

37
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,743
I'll call you later on

38
00:04:42,533 --> 00:04:46,003
I was talking to relative
Dakshina, bring a chair for sir

39
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:48,512
No need for chair and all
I have to go back urgently

40
00:04:48,567 --> 00:04:50,979
You tell me the matter
for which you called me

41
00:04:51,033 --> 00:04:55,709
This is what I like in you very much
You talk bravely to any big shot

42
00:04:55,767 --> 00:04:58,680
This is what made me
the fan of Vinay Chandran

43
00:04:58,767 --> 00:05:03,443
I know about the protests that you are
doing for the welfare of this country

44
00:05:03,533 --> 00:05:06,139
In Mullai Periyar against deforestation

45
00:05:06,233 --> 00:05:08,713
Against Cola factory
Against Express highway

46
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:12,476
Seeing all this in TV and
newspaperl have clapped a lot

47
00:05:12,567 --> 00:05:13,637
- Isn't it?
- Yes, boss

48
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:16,579
But now against
my Pushpam tower constructions...

49
00:05:16,633 --> 00:05:18,271
...you are going to do protest

50
00:05:18,367 --> 00:05:19,209
Yes

51
00:05:19,267 --> 00:05:22,510
From Monday onwards I'm going
to do hunger strike opposite this

52
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:26,742
Corporation had sanctioned this
place for children's park long back

53
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,644
As the Mayor is in your side, you
got permission illegally from him

54
00:05:29,733 --> 00:05:31,406
That is how you did this construction

55
00:05:31,467 --> 00:05:32,639
If shopping mall comes here

56
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,146
The danger of road
accident will increase

57
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,077
You can construct shop,
complex or anything

58
00:05:37,167 --> 00:05:39,477
But don't do that by
creating problem for people

59
00:05:39,533 --> 00:05:43,208
I got this approval
with lot of difficulty

60
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:46,179
First from PWD department
objection was expressed

61
00:05:46,233 --> 00:05:48,543
By paring rupees 25 lakhs
I changed that objection

62
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:52,571
As this building has 16 floors
airport authority kept an enquiry

63
00:05:52,633 --> 00:05:57,013
Therel paid 15 lakhs
Then water authority...fire force

64
00:05:57,067 --> 00:05:59,479
- Totally how much have we spent?
- One crore, boss

65
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:02,980
Yes, sir! I have paid
initial bribery of one crore

66
00:06:03,067 --> 00:06:05,570
Do you know why?
This is a project of 500 crores

67
00:06:05,633 --> 00:06:10,309
This is my dream project
So please you must save me

68
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,370
What is this?

69
00:06:18,433 --> 00:06:20,640
How much ever you want,
you can take it

70
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:23,203
I know that today is
your daughter's birthday

71
00:06:23,267 --> 00:06:25,076
This is a small birthday gift

72
00:06:25,133 --> 00:06:27,579
No rich man can desire
to buy me with money

73
00:06:27,633 --> 00:06:29,408
You can bribe
somebody else but not me

74
00:06:29,467 --> 00:06:31,344
I won't allow this to
be constructed here

75
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,346
Vinay Chandran sir, wait a minute

76
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,743
Come with me

77
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,447
This buildings construction
is 100% strong

78
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:42,277
You can see for yourself
A pile foundation of 150 feet deep

79
00:06:42,367 --> 00:06:45,439
Even if there is an earthquake
and the capital city collapses...

80
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,605
...nothing will happen
to this tower of mine

81
00:06:47,667 --> 00:06:51,046
Whatever you may say, there is no
question of mine backing out from this

82
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:54,274
if I'm alive, I'll not allow
this building of yours to come up

83
00:07:03,367 --> 00:07:08,043
Hey, put him alive in that
piling hole and bury him

84
00:07:08,133 --> 00:07:13,105
To make this foundation strong,
let a Gandian also be there

85
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:24,276
Padmanabha!

86
00:07:24,567 --> 00:07:31,416
<i>Tiff </i>

87
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:35,238
WANDERER KING

88
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:41,545
<i>tiff </i>

89
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:45,104
"To cross bridge we need Padmanabha"

90
00:07:45,167 --> 00:07:48,376
"On crossing the bride that
person is called as joker"

91
00:07:48,433 --> 00:07:51,778
"For the work to get
done we call Padmanabha"

92
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,106
"Once the work is over
they ask who the father is"

93
00:07:55,200 --> 00:08:01,640
"To all those devotees who are prospering
everything is fine and satisfactory"

94
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:08,584
"To all those parties which are on
top slogans are like golden words"

95
00:08:08,633 --> 00:08:12,080
"We have to slog all day,
work like a machine"

96
00:08:12,167 --> 00:08:15,637
"Somehow the weapon in
Padmanabhan's hand should be got hole of"

97
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:18,681
"Prayer...prayer...to you Padmanabha"

98
00:08:18,733 --> 00:08:22,237
"By singing your praise this
Padmanabhan came in search of you"

99
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:25,247
"Padmanabha...
Padmanabha...Padmanabha..."

100
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:29,043
Go fast! I must reach
at 11 o'clock sharp

101
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:33,138
"To cross bridge we need Padmanabha"

102
00:08:33,233 --> 00:08:35,440
- Stop! Stop!
- What is it, sir?

103
00:08:35,533 --> 00:08:36,409
You can't go this way

104
00:08:36,467 --> 00:08:38,344
There is road block
Go via Thagarapuram

105
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,074
Sir, at 11 o'clock
I have to meet the mayor

106
00:08:41,167 --> 00:08:42,407
- Is it, uncle?
- Yes

107
00:08:42,467 --> 00:08:44,674
Then you can tell
the leader of the city directly

108
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:47,236
It is his party procession
In another 3 to 4 areas it is going on

109
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,610
Everywhere there is road block
Take your vehicle...go

110
00:08:49,667 --> 00:08:52,079
My Sri padmanabha!
The time is 10:30

111
00:08:52,167 --> 00:08:55,740
- When will we reach?
- Can't you see these blocks?

112
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:02,542
"You are resting on the serpent
Now there is serpent everywhere in state"

113
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:06,241
"The question is who
the serpent charmer is"

114
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:09,439
"It the government only"

115
00:09:09,533 --> 00:09:12,707
"Does the protector of
world require protection?"

116
00:09:12,767 --> 00:09:16,340
"Was the treasure that was
found to be taken away?"

117
00:09:16,433 --> 00:09:19,607
"To show path in life
you taught Geeta"

118
00:09:19,667 --> 00:09:23,171
"To live don't we need processions?"

119
00:09:23,267 --> 00:09:29,775
"Padmanabha...Padmanabha...
Padmanabha...Sri Padmanabha..."

120
00:09:30,033 --> 00:09:33,310
"To cross bridge
we need Padmanabha"

121
00:09:33,367 --> 00:09:36,746
"On crossing the bride that
person is called as joker"

122
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,246
There is pot hole everywhere

123
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:41,438
Can't you see that road
construction is in progress?

124
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:44,037
- You go fast, brother
- The best place to go fast

125
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,706
This is the ditch area
If we fall in that, even if we have bath...

126
00:09:46,767 --> 00:09:50,180
...using the soap in this whole world,
the stinking smell won't leave"

127
00:09:50,267 --> 00:09:56,411
"The past kings presented
us this golden kingdom"

128
00:09:56,467 --> 00:10:03,442
"The kings of the present days
have made this kingdom as zero"

129
00:10:03,533 --> 00:10:07,106
"This is the time where the fence
itself is eating the cultivation"

130
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,443
"Won't you wake up
fast and look around?"

131
00:10:10,533 --> 00:10:13,980
"Don't you go away alone protector"

132
00:10:14,033 --> 00:10:17,310
"You take your
devotees also with you"

133
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:24,477
"Padmanabha...Padmanabha...
Padmanabha...Sri Padmanabha..."

134
00:10:27,067 --> 00:10:32,574
Move...move away
Make it fast

135
00:10:40,933 --> 00:10:43,106
- What is the matter?
- I don't know

136
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,470
Make it fast
Come on...come on...fast

137
00:10:52,933 --> 00:10:55,504
- Sir, what is the block there?
- Accident

138
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,137
A lorry banged on an auto in
which school children were there

139
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,543
Daily this is the problem here

140
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,012
From the time this Pushpam mall
construction began...

141
00:11:02,067 --> 00:11:03,637
...this is the eighth accident

142
00:11:03,733 --> 00:11:07,510
We can't go by this way
We'll go around Nandangoorway

143
00:11:07,567 --> 00:11:10,446
You can go by any route,
but you take me there by 11 o'clock

144
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,979
Let us see

145
00:11:17,367 --> 00:11:19,244
- Take this
- God! Thanks, uncle

146
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:21,313
That is okay
In meter only Rs 68 is showing

147
00:11:21,367 --> 00:11:22,243
Give me the change

148
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:26,112
You ask that from the meter
They start from home in the morning

149
00:11:26,167 --> 00:11:27,441
My Sri padmanaba!

150
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,504
Not only this city but the people here
have also become a nuisance

151
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:35,982
If you want the food inspector to sign
your hotel as okay, I want money for myself

152
00:11:36,033 --> 00:11:38,104
- That we accept
- Then it is okay

153
00:11:38,167 --> 00:11:38,770
Rs 500?

154
00:11:39,033 --> 00:11:42,708
To move a file from building section
you'll have to pay minimum Rs 2000

155
00:11:42,767 --> 00:11:44,212
Rest I'll give here

156
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,712
Once I get the money,
I'll do the work at once

157
00:11:46,767 --> 00:11:48,144
That I know

158
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:51,545
Give the rest money then
only your work will be done

159
00:11:51,633 --> 00:11:52,509
I'll give you

160
00:11:52,567 --> 00:11:54,638
What is this? For two hours
we are standing in the queue...

161
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:57,044
- There is no one in the counter
- The requirement is yours

162
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:58,305
You'll have to wait

163
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,341
ls there no one here?

164
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,738
My Lord!

165
00:12:19,667 --> 00:12:21,078
Who is this?

166
00:12:21,133 --> 00:12:23,773
Damodaran brother
Com e, come

167
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,446
- Brother, are you with or without?
- I don't understand

168
00:12:26,533 --> 00:12:29,036
Tea...do you have sugar problem?

169
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,740
- I don't want tea
- Don't say that to me

170
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,570
How can you leave from
here without drinking tea?

171
00:12:33,633 --> 00:12:35,078
I need to see that

172
00:12:35,167 --> 00:12:38,341
Maniya, bring a cup of strong tea
for Damodaran brother

173
00:12:38,433 --> 00:12:40,413
With that to eat, you
bring vada and cutlet

174
00:12:40,467 --> 00:12:43,141
- Get extra sauce
- I don't want anything

175
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,545
You don't talk
You are my guest now

176
00:12:46,633 --> 00:12:50,080
Old people have said
that guest is equal to God

177
00:12:50,167 --> 00:12:54,343
That was before
The present time belongs to Demons

178
00:12:54,433 --> 00:12:57,573
Whatever it may be
Damodaran's time is best time

179
00:12:57,667 --> 00:13:00,113
Didn't an opportunity come
to you brother to join...

180
00:13:00,167 --> 00:13:02,113
...the developmental
activities of this state

181
00:13:02,167 --> 00:13:04,773
- I don't understand
- You'll understand all that

182
00:13:05,033 --> 00:13:08,446
First you drink this tea
Then you eat all this

183
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,640
Brother, when you give your
land to Prakashan boss...

184
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:15,671
...he'l lbuild a centralized
AC auditorium there

185
00:13:15,733 --> 00:13:19,112
Near our temple there is
no other hall like that

186
00:13:19,167 --> 00:13:23,513
- Isn't that a benefit to us?
- Mayor sir! Don't try to make a fool of me

187
00:13:23,567 --> 00:13:25,672
You called me here on
the name of compromise

188
00:13:25,733 --> 00:13:27,178
I got a hope

189
00:13:27,267 --> 00:13:29,543
You must stand
on the side ofjustice sir

190
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,204
This is the land of Padmanabhan

191
00:13:31,267 --> 00:13:33,178
I'll not give that to anyone

192
00:13:33,267 --> 00:13:38,148
Not only Padmanabhan's land but
I'll buy that Padmanabhan itself

193
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,407
He is an innocent man
You sit inside boss

194
00:13:40,467 --> 00:13:42,538
- I'll talk to Damodaran
- Get lost

195
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:48,516
Old man, all the 40 people near your
place have agreed to give their land to me

196
00:13:48,567 --> 00:13:52,242
- Why are you so arrogant?
- What are you doing this?

197
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:55,610
Damodaran can understand
the tears of an innocent rich man

198
00:13:55,667 --> 00:14:00,047
This drama is excellent
I'm assured that I'll not get justice here

199
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,238
I'm going

200
00:14:01,567 --> 00:14:03,706
- Gosh!
- Stop there

201
00:14:03,767 --> 00:14:07,715
I know how to send you to
the place where you should reach

202
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,507
My name is Pushpam Prakashan

203
00:14:09,567 --> 00:14:12,741
Within a week I'll
get that land from you

204
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,209
As long as I'm alive, it
is not possible Prakashan

205
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:21,181
Hey! My habit is to achieve
what I want at any cost

206
00:14:21,233 --> 00:14:23,338
Boss, don't do anything stupid

207
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,208
Leave him, Leave him

208
00:14:24,267 --> 00:14:26,474
- He'll die
- You old mani

209
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:29,412
By sending complaint about
me to DGP, minister and court...

210
00:14:29,467 --> 00:14:31,378
...did you think
you can scare me?

211
00:14:31,433 --> 00:14:32,377
- Philipose!
- Sir!

212
00:14:32,467 --> 00:14:33,571
Take that out

213
00:14:33,667 --> 00:14:38,082
Did you see how boss is massaging
the coughing Damodaran brother?

214
00:14:38,133 --> 00:14:40,739
Sir, this file has to be
forwarded to secretariat today itself

215
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:41,774
You sign in this

216
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,209
We are talking about much
more important matter here

217
00:14:45,267 --> 00:14:45,768
Sir!

218
00:14:46,033 --> 00:14:47,068
You leave, Superintendent

219
00:14:47,167 --> 00:14:48,305
I'll sign that
and then call you

220
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,435
- Okay
- Go, go

221
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,706
People like him come

222
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,178
Hey! Read that out

223
00:14:53,367 --> 00:14:55,643
To the notice of
the respected DGP

224
00:14:55,733 --> 00:14:59,112
This is a complaint by
Meleidathu Damodaran

225
00:14:59,167 --> 00:15:02,671
Sir, there is danger
to my life any moment

226
00:15:02,767 --> 00:15:08,445
If I die the whole responsibility to that
will be Pushpam group's MD Prakashan

227
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,173
Isn't that over smartness, brother?

228
00:15:10,233 --> 00:15:13,544
You don't know about
Prakashan boss, hold

229
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:18,015
Boss got the copy of the complaint from
all the office where you sent complaint

230
00:15:18,067 --> 00:15:19,478
That is what is boss

231
00:15:19,533 --> 00:15:24,141
Not only to minister and police
I have given a complaint to God also

232
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:27,204
I'm sure to get
justice at least from there

233
00:15:27,267 --> 00:15:28,371
The complaint about me

234
00:15:28,433 --> 00:15:31,471
One day I'm sure
to find the original of that

235
00:15:31,567 --> 00:15:34,707
That day your story will get over

236
00:15:40,167 --> 00:15:42,044
There is going to be
city development

237
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:44,171
Why didn't you give
a punch on his face, grandpa?

238
00:15:44,233 --> 00:15:46,577
Then we could have seen
the development of that face

239
00:15:46,633 --> 00:15:49,011
They act so humble when
they come to ask for vote

240
00:15:49,067 --> 00:15:52,310
We'll give milk, honey
You can ask whatever you need

241
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:56,780
I also cast a vote to that disgrace
Respected Mayor

242
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,570
He should be called
as a fraud mayor

243
00:15:58,633 --> 00:16:00,476
From the days I remember

244
00:16:00,533 --> 00:16:05,346
I have ringed the bell in
Sri padmanabhan's temple

245
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:09,143
With this hand I can no more
hold the feet of any devil

246
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,476
You need not go and hold
anyone's hand and leg, grandpa

247
00:16:11,567 --> 00:16:15,208
I'll go and see that mayor
I need to speak two words on his face

248
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:16,370
No need, dear

249
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:20,540
There is a person due to whom
we got this house and land

250
00:16:20,633 --> 00:16:25,981
That is Ponnu Thamburan
Tomorrowl'm going to go and meet him

251
00:16:40,767 --> 00:16:42,405
What is it, Damodara?

252
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:54,645
This is what they call as
pounding stone complaining to drum

253
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:59,271
I'm a king without crown
and scepter, Damodara

254
00:16:59,733 --> 00:17:05,376
Due to my ancestors' good deeds,
people still give me respect and support

255
00:17:05,467 --> 00:17:08,073
You told me now
about Pushpam Prakashan

256
00:17:08,167 --> 00:17:11,444
Many of the palace's property
are in the hands of that Prakashan

257
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:14,071
From Thovalai he came
here for flower business

258
00:17:14,167 --> 00:17:18,343
He entered the palace as a servant
Feeling sorry for him I helped him

259
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,313
But he stung the hand
which fed him milk

260
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,607
I'm thinking to whom
I should complaint against him

261
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,646
That house is the only
property that I have

262
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,304
If I had been alone...

263
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:34,349
...I would have stayed
in a corner of this temple

264
00:17:34,433 --> 00:17:38,711
But I'm worried thinking
about my grand daughter

265
00:17:38,767 --> 00:17:43,113
She doesn't have parents
There are cruel animals around us

266
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:48,048
What will I do my lord?
To whom should I tell my problem?

267
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:53,107
God Sri padmanabhan takes
many incarnations to uphold...

268
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,510
...the virtue on various eras

269
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:02,313
Like me you also pray to God
Sri padmanabhan will listen to that prayer

270
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,779
My Sri padmanabhan!!!!!

271
00:18:16,667 --> 00:18:20,774
The religious procession in
connection with the festival of...

272
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,971
...Goddess Mariamman which
is the divine prosperity of

273
00:18:25,033 --> 00:18:27,673
...Palakadu is advancing
through the streets

274
00:18:27,733 --> 00:18:31,306
Maruthuvamalai Hanuman
tabloid is being sponsored by...

275
00:18:31,367 --> 00:18:35,611
...Prem Kumar and Hari Kumar
on behalf of Meenakshiammal

276
00:18:35,667 --> 00:18:39,979
Adhiparashakti, who makes
the statue of colossal demon

277
00:18:40,033 --> 00:18:43,207
ls being sponsored by Kunjiraman
of Meenakshi manniram...

278
00:18:43,267 --> 00:18:45,178
...who doesn't want to
disclose his name

279
00:18:45,233 --> 00:18:46,405
Stupid! It is not just Kunjiraman

280
00:18:46,467 --> 00:18:50,711
- It is retired major Kunjiraman Nambiar
- It is retired major Kanjiraman...no

281
00:18:50,767 --> 00:18:52,644
Kunjiraman Nambiar

282
00:18:52,733 --> 00:18:56,442
The sword fig ht between the darling
of our place Makkal Thilagam MGR...

283
00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:03,315
...and villain is being sponsored
by Azim and company from Alathur

284
00:19:04,667 --> 00:19:07,170
A sword which can't take it out

285
00:19:07,267 --> 00:19:10,271
Where is that MGR with
whom I should fight?

286
00:19:10,367 --> 00:19:20,254
"If I give order and
if that takes place"

287
00:19:21,467 --> 00:19:25,438
"if I give order and
if that takes place"

288
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:29,209
"The poor won't be sad"

289
00:19:29,267 --> 00:19:32,771
"Till they are alive,
they'll not have any difficulty"

290
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,504
"They'll never fall
in sea of water"

291
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:40,571
"They'll never fall
in sea of water"

292
00:19:47,367 --> 00:19:49,711
"if I give order and
if that takes place"

293
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,007
Padmanabha, are you MGR?

294
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:55,274
Yes, I'm the revolutionary leader MGR

295
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:58,439
Then where is that Shivan Kutty
who acts regularly as MGR?

296
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:01,743
He did get ready in MGR's
attire and sword to fight

297
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:07,773
But he landed in front
of the new SI Murugesan

298
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,037
In front of that devil?
Then what happened?

299
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:13,047
Then what has to happen?
He is on the way to Bihar

300
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:16,445
- For what?
- To set him up as terrorist

301
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,478
God!

302
00:20:20,433 --> 00:20:25,075
- 1, 2, 3, 4...
- You tell him

303
00:20:25,167 --> 00:20:26,703
Give that to me
Enough

304
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:28,769
No need to count again and
again and tear the skin in hand

305
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,537
Is it enough if I give you?
I have to do the settlement to others

306
00:20:31,633 --> 00:20:34,512
We had many other
commitments in the morning

307
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:36,672
Our opposition leader's road protest

308
00:20:36,733 --> 00:20:39,680
Ananatha Menon sir's grandma died
We were called there to cry in that

309
00:20:39,733 --> 00:20:42,441
Like that many good
opportunities we gave up...

310
00:20:42,533 --> 00:20:44,513
...and took this festival quotation

311
00:20:44,567 --> 00:20:47,571
Over that you made me do
the job I didn't know

312
00:20:47,633 --> 00:20:48,509
You come on

313
00:20:48,567 --> 00:20:50,604
Look we and curry
leaves are similar

314
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:53,010
Once your job is over,
we are waste, isn't it?

315
00:20:53,067 --> 00:20:56,014
I feel very bad! Due to this
I have not eaten anything today

316
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,137
Move your leg
Let me take my Gad ha

317
00:20:58,233 --> 00:21:00,042
- My Dhoti!
- Who wants your dhoti?

318
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:02,478
Okay, I accept
What question is that?

319
00:21:02,533 --> 00:21:04,638
You come to Palakadu
and ask anyone

320
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,737
...and took this festival quotation

321
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,609
If you tell us to scream,
we would have screamed

322
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,976
Any one will become a fan of us

323
00:21:11,067 --> 00:21:13,274
Per head you'll have to pay Rs 200
Don't forget, okay

324
00:21:13,367 --> 00:21:14,675
Which is this
next project, Sarasappa?

325
00:21:14,733 --> 00:21:15,973
Are we going to go to
parliament and scream?

326
00:21:16,033 --> 00:21:17,137
In parliament they
don't need outsider

327
00:21:17,233 --> 00:21:20,339
They have there own people to lift
up cloths, to abuse and to scream

328
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,435
I forgot that

329
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,707
This was our superstar
Ramesh's manager

330
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,576
Tomorrow is the release
of megastar Ramu's film

331
00:21:26,633 --> 00:21:29,113
The movie will be showcased in
our Palakadu Priyadarshini theatre

332
00:21:29,167 --> 00:21:31,010
They want 100 people to
see that movie and scream

333
00:21:31,067 --> 00:21:32,205
How is that possible?

334
00:21:32,267 --> 00:21:36,443
This Ramu's manager wants
100 people to see the movie and clap

335
00:21:36,533 --> 00:21:38,376
We don't have enough
people to send in both places

336
00:21:38,433 --> 00:21:40,709
- That'll become a problem
- Don't be tensed for that

337
00:21:40,767 --> 00:21:43,077
It is Ram u's film
After the end of three scenes...

338
00:21:43,133 --> 00:21:44,737
...the audience themselves
will start to scream

339
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,505
That is true

340
00:21:45,567 --> 00:21:47,478
You distribute
the money to all of them

341
00:21:47,533 --> 00:21:49,274
Sarasappa, this is your share

342
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:52,041
Tomorrow evening at 6 o'clock sharp
tell all of them to reach town hall

343
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:54,011
- Is it at 6 o'clock?
- What programme do we have there?

344
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,670
Tomorrow there is
a poetry recital programme

345
00:21:55,733 --> 00:21:57,770
Collect some philosophical
looking people also

346
00:21:58,033 --> 00:22:01,776
Hearing poetry they'll
have to shake head like this

347
00:22:09,567 --> 00:22:11,137
Pushpam!

348
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,440
What are you doing here?

349
00:22:23,533 --> 00:22:25,069
How did you enter the house?

350
00:22:25,133 --> 00:22:27,010
Meera! Dear Meera!

351
00:22:27,067 --> 00:22:29,206
Don't create a commotion, Damodaran sir

352
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:30,779
Your grand daughter
is here only

353
00:22:31,033 --> 00:22:32,444
KannaPPa!

354
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,035
Dear!

355
00:22:39,633 --> 00:22:40,634
Dear!

356
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:45,115
What is this?
Let go of us, rascal

357
00:22:45,167 --> 00:22:46,009
I'll leave her

358
00:22:46,067 --> 00:22:48,638
She won't be harmed in any way
and we'll leave her

359
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:51,476
But you sign here

360
00:22:51,567 --> 00:22:55,276
Boss has sent double the amount
than what he told you before

361
00:22:55,333 --> 00:22:58,280
You just sign here
Damodaran brother

362
00:22:58,333 --> 00:23:00,142
Rest boss will handle

363
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,703
I'll not sign
Even if I lose my life...

364
00:23:02,767 --> 00:23:05,509
...I won't give a grain of
sand from this place

365
00:23:05,567 --> 00:23:07,569
Then we'll take her

366
00:23:07,633 --> 00:23:11,740
If for you this land is more valuable,
than her virtue, you hug this and stay here

367
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,041
You won't get back
even her dead body

368
00:23:14,133 --> 00:23:18,104
No, don't harm her
I'll sign where ever you want

369
00:23:18,167 --> 00:23:20,169
Then you put
a signature here

370
00:23:20,233 --> 00:23:21,143
I'll sign

371
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,579
I'll sign where ever you want
Leave my grand daughter

372
00:23:26,767 --> 00:23:28,440
Sri padmanabhan!

373
00:23:30,467 --> 00:23:31,502
Dear...!

374
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,514
- You!
- Leave her

375
00:23:39,633 --> 00:23:42,341
For the time being we
are taking her with us

376
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,073
You come there and sign

377
00:23:44,167 --> 00:23:47,580
Then you can take
her over my dead body

378
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,241
God! Did the thorn get
stuck in your throat?

379
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,335
Move away, idiot

380
00:23:56,433 --> 00:23:59,175
Take him to hospital
at once and treat him

381
00:23:59,233 --> 00:24:02,442
Boss, isn't it good for
us if this old guy dies?

382
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,673
You won't have any problem, boss

383
00:24:04,733 --> 00:24:07,475
You fool! Slap yourself
with your slipper

384
00:24:07,533 --> 00:24:10,207
If he dies the blame
will fall on me

385
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:15,648
He has given a complaint like that only
He must survive, else I'll go to prison

386
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:19,045
Take him fast to
some hospital nearby

387
00:24:19,667 --> 00:24:22,204
My Sri padmanabhan!

388
00:24:24,467 --> 00:24:28,142
It is getting late
Where the hell has he gone?

389
00:24:28,233 --> 00:24:30,042
Jayetta, they are not to be seen

390
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:34,276
If Padmanabhan has said so,
he'll fly and come at the right time

391
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:42,636
Good!

392
00:24:46,167 --> 00:24:47,510
Move, move

393
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,738
Greetings!
Greetings!

394
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,575
- Padmanabhan!
- All of us have reached

395
00:24:50,667 --> 00:24:54,376
Why did you all come in auto rickshaw?
I expected you to come as a procession

396
00:24:54,434 --> 00:24:57,244
You told us to come urgently
That is why we came in auto

397
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:59,780
- You must give extra Rs 100 per head
- I'll give all that

398
00:25:00,033 --> 00:25:02,013
You start shouting slogan
It is getting late

399
00:25:02,067 --> 00:25:03,546
- Where is the thing?
- Here is the petroleum minister

400
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,477
This is the petrol to burn
Keep it safely

401
00:25:05,534 --> 00:25:07,775
You have done a very
good job, Padmanabhan

402
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,571
Great Padmanabhan!
Great Padmanabhan!

403
00:25:10,633 --> 00:25:13,614
- Let us start shouting slogans
- Sarasappa

404
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:18,479
'-I did the registration for 2112 acre
-I did the registration for 2112 acre'

405
00:25:18,534 --> 00:25:23,711
'- 1112 litter's petrol was bought
- 1112 litter's petrol was bought'

406
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:26,371
'With car one bullock
was also bought'

407
00:25:26,434 --> 00:25:29,074
'With car one bullock
was also bought'

408
00:25:29,133 --> 00:25:31,409
'To pull that petrol
vehicle is needed'

409
00:25:31,467 --> 00:25:33,743
'To pull that petrol
vehicle is needed'

410
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,001
Now you shout

411
00:25:35,067 --> 00:25:38,640
'Petrol minister useless'

412
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:43,581
'Petrol minister useless'

413
00:25:43,633 --> 00:25:45,271
Gosh, I made a mistake

414
00:25:45,367 --> 00:25:47,210
If it is a mistake,
you should have told earlier

415
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:51,612
'- Petrol minister useless
- Petrol minister useless'

416
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:55,705
'- Soon I'll call back
- Soon I'll call back'

417
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,108
I said that in phone

418
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,146
I'll go to that Kamath's shop
and have a tea

419
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,338
- You continue
- Then what about us?

420
00:26:00,433 --> 00:26:01,377
We are one

421
00:26:01,434 --> 00:26:02,777
You continue
Make it grand

422
00:26:03,034 --> 00:26:04,138
I'll back at once

423
00:26:05,167 --> 00:26:08,239
Kamath, give me
my usual tea with extra sugar

424
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,610
- I'll give just now
- Hey!

425
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,147
Is it Hameedikka?
Kamath, make two cups of tea

426
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,202
I didn't come
to drink your tea

427
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:19,144
You sound angry
Kamath, get something cold

428
00:26:19,234 --> 00:26:21,976
Have you decided to
never become a good guy?

429
00:26:22,067 --> 00:26:25,014
What is this?
I'm becoming a good guy

430
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:28,309
Now itself I'll be getting from
that Sarasappan Rs 2000 as commission

431
00:26:28,367 --> 00:26:30,574
There was a man
whom we all respected

432
00:26:30,667 --> 00:26:32,442
Self respected comrade Mad havan

433
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:35,174
That man's son is moving
around from one party to...

434
00:26:35,234 --> 00:26:38,010
...another party daily
without any individuality

435
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,670
That too for money

436
00:26:39,733 --> 00:26:43,977
The duty of a son is to
fulfill a dead father's dream

437
00:26:44,067 --> 00:26:46,479
A good day when all
the people will be happy

438
00:26:46,534 --> 00:26:48,605
Isn't that what
my father's dream was?

439
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:51,647
I'm going on fulfilling
father's dream

440
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:54,112
At the present age when
unemployment is a major issue...

441
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:57,670
...through me some 400 to 500
people are getting daily job

442
00:26:57,767 --> 00:27:00,714
Do you see there?
To shout slogan

443
00:27:00,767 --> 00:27:04,180
To hear social awareness speeches
To pull the crowd in theatre

444
00:27:04,267 --> 00:27:08,238
To cry in dead people's house
who have no one to cry for themselves

445
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:10,473
By supplying people like that
I maintain balanced approach...

446
00:27:10,534 --> 00:27:13,208
...in political, an, social,
family welfare departments

447
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:15,507
Due to me people like
Kamath are able to sell...

448
00:27:15,567 --> 00:27:18,446
...some 500 cups of tea,
vada and fried banana

449
00:27:18,534 --> 00:27:21,071
- How are the sales of your puffed rice?
- It is getting sold well

450
00:27:21,133 --> 00:27:22,134
Hear this!

451
00:27:22,233 --> 00:27:25,180
Then in morning Congress
Afternoon communist

452
00:27:25,233 --> 00:27:27,338
Evening BJP...
at night 'rest'

453
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:30,347
As I keep opting for
different parties daily

454
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,676
I prove strongly that man is one

455
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:37,149
How can I fulfill my father's dream
better than this, Hameedikka?

456
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,372
Give that tea

457
00:27:38,433 --> 00:27:40,606
Have this Seeing you drink one cup...

458
00:27:40,667 --> 00:27:43,477
...of tea from my hand, let
my father's soul feel happy

459
00:27:43,567 --> 00:27:47,242
It is not your name, but Madhavettan's
name which you are spoiling

460
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:49,280
Have you come
to have a cup of tea?

461
00:27:49,333 --> 00:27:50,243
Drink this

462
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:51,540
Love's greater

463
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,638
Kamath, take that
tea's money from him

464
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:56,611
If possible for my tea also

465
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,676
Idiot! During sunset time
don't dream like that and scream

466
00:28:04,734 --> 00:28:08,181
You should have thought before
asking for bribe from that judge

467
00:28:08,267 --> 00:28:10,611
It is time for my 5th cup of tea

468
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:12,338
The service is very bad

469
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,505
I have been waiting for sometime

470
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,443
For that you are not
in service now

471
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,741
It'll be served a bit late

472
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:21,610
A balloon without air
Atoothless lion

473
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,407
A policeman without cap

474
00:28:23,467 --> 00:28:26,038
In veda, it is given
that all these 3 are similar

475
00:28:26,133 --> 00:28:28,170
No one will give respect

476
00:28:28,233 --> 00:28:34,514
Even this easy chair is
telling me to get up and go

477
00:28:34,567 --> 00:28:37,343
I used to frame my enemies in
fraud case and by arresting...

478
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,402
...them I used to bash them
up and make them spit blood

479
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:42,481
I don't know whether
those good days will return

480
00:28:42,533 --> 00:28:44,740
Brother-in-law, why are you
talking about spitting blood?

481
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:47,144
Morning after waking up
when I coughed and spit...

482
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,338
...there were blood stains in that

483
00:28:48,433 --> 00:28:51,607
I should get myself tested for cancer as
doesn't take long for a person to get that

484
00:28:51,667 --> 00:28:54,113
lfthere are brother-in-laws like this

485
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,679
The family is sure
to get cancer

486
00:28:55,767 --> 00:28:57,041
The whole family
will get destroyed

487
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:58,636
Do not accuse him
He is innocent

488
00:28:58,700 --> 00:28:59,474
Best

489
00:28:59,533 --> 00:29:02,412
When a person is depressed,
the family should console him

490
00:29:02,467 --> 00:29:07,007
- Yes, is there alcohol in the bag?
- There is nothing in this

491
00:29:07,067 --> 00:29:09,069
Hey, there is nothing in that

492
00:29:09,133 --> 00:29:12,080
Don't drink that
Don't drink that

493
00:29:12,134 --> 00:29:13,374
Give that

494
00:29:13,467 --> 00:29:16,038
- Leave me
- What are you doing?

495
00:29:17,267 --> 00:29:20,612
Gosh! My god!
It is gone

496
00:29:24,433 --> 00:29:25,969
Did you drink that fully?

497
00:29:26,033 --> 00:29:27,444
Why? Did you want it?

498
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:31,004
Brother-in-law, it is the oil
which I had bought to pour in lamp

499
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:34,172
There was no change in taste and
slight intoxication is also there

500
00:29:34,234 --> 00:29:37,511
Sister, bring a long wick
Keep it in his mouth and light it

501
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,342
For nearly a month, let this
lamp sit in veranda and give light

502
00:29:40,433 --> 00:29:43,209
At what time did I get the idea
of marrying my sister to this oil?

503
00:29:43,267 --> 00:29:44,302
Are you happy now?

504
00:29:44,367 --> 00:29:46,244
If you get freely,
you'll even drink acid

505
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:47,779
Rice, vegetable and provisions

506
00:29:48,033 --> 00:29:49,410
Everything is ready

507
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,209
Your regular act seems
to be a bit over today

508
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,445
Sowmya, take this

509
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,480
Mother can neither
hear nor lift her hand

510
00:29:58,567 --> 00:30:01,138
You keep this inside
Her hand is lifting

511
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,181
Brother, tomorrowl have
to give semester fees

512
00:30:04,267 --> 00:30:08,716
I was about to say
for college association meeting

513
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:12,543
For that the principal owes Rs 4000 to me

514
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:16,047
Deducting yourfees from that
the principal must give me the rest amount

515
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:19,081
Else tell him that I'll burn his
poster in front of that college

516
00:30:19,167 --> 00:30:21,010
Do they want fees for educating?

517
00:30:21,067 --> 00:30:23,013
When did the term
fees arise?

518
00:30:23,333 --> 00:30:25,006
What timing?

519
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:27,273
I was expecting
your shout

520
00:30:27,334 --> 00:30:29,541
Hameedikka's and
Raviettan's advising is over

521
00:30:29,633 --> 00:30:31,476
Now you can go ahead, mother

522
00:30:31,567 --> 00:30:33,308
- Brother-in-law!
- What is it?

523
00:30:33,367 --> 00:30:37,713
- I also wanted to advice you
- Will Satan teach Vedas?

524
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,607
I know there is no use of telling
Vedas in buffalo's ear

525
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,373
That is the reason
I also don't tell

526
00:30:43,467 --> 00:30:46,004
Stop there
Today Prabhakaran sir had come

527
00:30:46,067 --> 00:30:48,377
Everyone feels bad
seeing you like this

528
00:30:48,467 --> 00:30:51,004
You go and meet any of
the leaders of party

529
00:30:51,067 --> 00:30:53,479
Why can't you go and ask them
to get you a job?

530
00:30:53,533 --> 00:30:55,137
That is what sir told

531
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:59,143
[my father!
My mother!

532
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,578
Father's party has got disintegrated
into four sectors

533
00:31:01,667 --> 00:31:03,669
North, middle, south and east

534
00:31:03,767 --> 00:31:07,112
In this I should go to which
section to ask about my job?

535
00:31:07,234 --> 00:31:10,010
The days have gone
when on hearing comrade

536
00:31:10,067 --> 00:31:13,674
Madhavan's name people
used to stand up

537
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,711
Now the party is in
high-tech form

538
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:16,710
Not only that

539
00:31:16,767 --> 00:31:18,144
For had an accidental death

540
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:21,374
Accidental death can't come
in the list of martyrs

541
00:31:21,434 --> 00:31:25,211
Else every year we would
have got at least red garland

542
00:31:30,467 --> 00:31:33,676
Hello! What is it, Sarasappa?

543
00:31:33,733 --> 00:31:37,180
Padmanabhan, we have
got a super assignment

544
00:31:37,267 --> 00:31:40,180
With 200 people we'll
have to go to the capital

545
00:31:40,233 --> 00:31:43,442
- For which party?
- For sake the mayor

546
00:31:43,533 --> 00:31:45,410
They are getting
people in all Kerala level

547
00:31:45,467 --> 00:31:48,414
A rich team is sponsoring this

548
00:31:49,467 --> 00:31:52,141
Tomorrow morning
I'm going to the capital

549
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:55,773
Brother-in-law, don't scold me
Shall I also come?

550
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,072
If I get a daily wage of
Rs 500, it'll be of help

551
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:02,273
No, it'll be a help for
your sister to run family

552
00:32:02,367 --> 00:32:06,110
Then I can go to secretariat
regarding my suspension matter

553
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,736
Shall I come?

554
00:32:09,067 --> 00:32:11,604
Many fools, idiots, useless
and senseless men are coming

555
00:32:11,667 --> 00:32:12,645
You can also join

556
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:14,202
No one will recognize you

557
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:17,572
lnqulaab! lnqulaab! lnqulaab! Zindabad!

558
00:32:17,634 --> 00:32:20,171
Is this how you
shout in processions?

559
00:32:20,233 --> 00:32:22,270
I'll go now itself,
bath and get ready

560
00:32:22,334 --> 00:32:23,074
<i>Now?</i>

561
00:32:23,167 --> 00:32:25,511
Yes, early morning we have
to go to Thiruvananthapuram

562
00:32:25,567 --> 00:32:29,071
lfl have bath in morning,
I might catch cold

563
00:32:29,267 --> 00:32:32,612
I mustjumpfrom here
tomorrow morning before he gets up

564
00:32:55,367 --> 00:32:57,278
Can't you see that
there is road block?

565
00:32:57,333 --> 00:32:59,745
Why the hell are you ringing the horn?

566
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:03,747
- This face is very familiar to me
- It is Maharaja Thirumanasu

567
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,172
Give way

568
00:33:05,267 --> 00:33:10,012
In past during King's rule
you have mislead many people

569
00:33:10,067 --> 00:33:12,069
Today you wait here for sometime

570
00:33:12,134 --> 00:33:13,238
Please, give way

571
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:15,007
Thamburan has got to go to the temple

572
00:33:15,067 --> 00:33:16,068
Greetings!

573
00:33:16,133 --> 00:33:17,578
Do you know
to whom you are talking?

574
00:33:17,667 --> 00:33:19,544
Yes, I know
In the past while in school

575
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,637
They have got me hit by teachers a lot

576
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,338
That too for answering wrongly
the period of their rule

577
00:33:23,434 --> 00:33:25,380
- They have shed the blood of poor
- Stop it

578
00:33:25,433 --> 00:33:27,413
With the eyes you see all
royal families, don't see the family of

579
00:33:27,467 --> 00:33:28,411
Thiruvangoor royal family too

580
00:33:28,467 --> 00:33:31,243
It is a royal family which has
ruled with only human welfare in front

581
00:33:31,334 --> 00:33:33,336
They only brought
the first University in Kerala

582
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,346
Music college, waterways,
railways and English education

583
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,505
All this was brought
by Thiruvangoor Kings

584
00:33:37,567 --> 00:33:39,706
During Tipu Sultan war
if they had not fought...

585
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:42,041
...and won, Kerala
won't have been there

586
00:33:42,133 --> 00:33:44,204
Thirumanasu, forgive his ignorance

587
00:33:44,267 --> 00:33:46,144
- Move away, move away
- Move, move

588
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,042
Give way

589
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:49,046
- What is your name?
- Padmanabhan

590
00:33:49,134 --> 00:33:51,045
I'm from Palakadu

591
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,338
okay

592
00:33:52,633 --> 00:33:56,137
- From where did you learn all this?
- It was taught to me by my father

593
00:33:56,233 --> 00:34:01,046
I also had a father
I asked him to name the capital of Kerala

594
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:04,741
He told me it is India
Unfortunately he died

595
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:10,272
The grand procession will start in
Vellai Ambalam will near the LMS gate

596
00:34:10,333 --> 00:34:12,779
Before that crowd you must also stand

597
00:34:13,034 --> 00:34:13,671
Gosh!

598
00:34:13,733 --> 00:34:18,307
The procession will cross Fine Ans college
and come near University stadium

599
00:34:18,367 --> 00:34:20,643
These people will stand
there readily for everything

600
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:22,475
Boss, the idea is good

601
00:34:22,534 --> 00:34:24,480
But I'm very much tensed

602
00:34:24,533 --> 00:34:27,673
Keep quiet
All this is for you to win again

603
00:34:27,767 --> 00:34:32,113
While you are reaching our side,
you'll get a missed call in your mobile

604
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,544
As soon as that comes
you should back away

605
00:34:34,633 --> 00:34:37,375
Once you go back, within two
minutes there will be a bomb...

606
00:34:37,433 --> 00:34:39,106
...blast in the place you were standing

607
00:34:39,167 --> 00:34:42,546
Mother! Bomb?
ls bomb needed, boss?

608
00:34:42,633 --> 00:34:45,011
- Someone might die
- Let them die

609
00:34:45,067 --> 00:34:48,344
We are doing all this for that only
Anyone can die

610
00:34:48,467 --> 00:34:53,712
If there is anyone close to you nearby you
that person also to the back with you

611
00:34:54,167 --> 00:34:58,309
Instead of that you make
hired men stand in the front

612
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:02,038
In that hired people let
one or two people die

613
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:06,141
Only when one gets destroyed,
the other one can grow

614
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:08,541
- Kannappa, have you understood?
- I have understood

615
00:35:08,634 --> 00:35:12,138
I'll lead the procession
Then the phone bell will ring

616
00:35:12,234 --> 00:35:15,545
I retreat back
Bomb drops and blast occurs

617
00:35:15,634 --> 00:35:19,275
Then I become a mayor again
My Mother!

618
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:21,278
Everything should go off well

619
00:35:21,333 --> 00:35:24,610
Mayor Purushu Zindabad!
Mayor Purushu Zindabad!

620
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:28,773
- Purushu Purushu! Our Purushu!

621
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,346
- Our Purushu Zindabad!
- Our Purushu Zindabad!

622
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:36,074
This is the first time
I'm seeing a mayor alive

623
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:37,112
Is it?

624
00:35:37,167 --> 00:35:38,407
I'm Padmanabhan

625
00:35:38,467 --> 00:35:41,414
- From Mannat?
- No Manar, Palakadu

626
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:44,174
- Have you come to Palakadu, sir?
- Stop talking

627
00:35:44,234 --> 00:35:49,445
- There are lakhs of people behind you
- There are lakhs of people behind you

628
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:53,309
Sir, per head the rate is Rs 650
You must give something extra

629
00:35:53,367 --> 00:35:56,075

630
00:35:56,167 --> 00:35:57,612
- We'll bring more people
- Yes

631
00:35:57,667 --> 00:36:01,979
If you order for 1000 people,
we'll give you discount

632
00:36:02,067 --> 00:36:04,479
- Our Purushu Zindabad!
- Our Purushu Zindabad!

633
00:36:04,567 --> 00:36:08,014
What is it, sir? ls there no range?
You call from my mobile

634
00:36:08,067 --> 00:36:12,277
- Get lost with your mobile
- My mobile

635
00:36:12,333 --> 00:36:16,281
- How'll I call you?
- My mobile has gone into four pieces

636
00:36:16,367 --> 00:36:18,278
Did he think that it is coconut?

637
00:36:18,334 --> 00:36:21,042
- Our Purushu Zindabad!
- Our Purushu Zindabad!

638
00:36:21,134 --> 00:36:24,479
- Our Purushu Zindabad!

639
00:36:24,534 --> 00:36:28,209
Bomb! Run away

640
00:36:33,534 --> 00:36:35,241
I'm unable to move

641
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:37,439
Sarasappa, get stretcher
or wheel chair

642
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:40,572
- I have another trip
- Then leave your auto and run by yourself

643
00:36:40,634 --> 00:36:43,137
Let me first unload this body
Then you can go

644
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,235
Come on

645
00:36:44,567 --> 00:36:47,605
- Hello, Attender!
- Can't you see that he is compounder?

646
00:36:47,667 --> 00:36:49,977
- Are you an Attender?
- Yes

647
00:36:50,034 --> 00:36:52,446
On patient is outside

648
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:55,777
- I need a wheel chair
- Is he laughing?

649
00:36:58,467 --> 00:36:59,468
Enough

650
00:36:59,534 --> 00:37:02,447
George, come here
They wanta wheel chair

651
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:03,376
Wheel chair?

652
00:37:03,467 --> 00:37:06,778
CompounderSukumaran is lying
in chair getting intoxicated

653
00:37:07,034 --> 00:37:07,603
Wheel chair

654
00:37:07,667 --> 00:37:09,647
Have you come for
the first time in medical college?

655
00:37:09,734 --> 00:37:10,769
That is the problem

656
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,675
There is wheel chair here but if you
want that to roll, I want money

657
00:37:14,733 --> 00:37:17,236
Then if we give money,
will this wheel chair roll?

658
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:19,041
It'll immediately roll

659
00:37:20,167 --> 00:37:21,510
We have got wheel chair

660
00:37:21,567 --> 00:37:23,478
Lift him and keep him here

661
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,409
God!

662
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:28,344
- What kind of wheel is this?
- There is one wheel

663
00:37:28,467 --> 00:37:30,674
It is enough if a person
holds from other side

664
00:37:30,733 --> 00:37:32,337
Gosh! Something is biting

665
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,311
It is not something
It is bug

666
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,607
It is eager to drink new blood

667
00:37:37,133 --> 00:37:39,238
There are so many things to bite

668
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:42,679
- But it seems to like you
- This side

669
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:46,111
God! Was this maternity ward? Sorry

670
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:49,140
- Come this side
- Slowly, slowly

671
00:37:50,134 --> 00:37:51,204
What is this?

672
00:37:51,334 --> 00:37:54,338
Doctor, it is not a thing
While preparing others puppet

673
00:37:54,467 --> 00:37:58,108
I never imagined
I'll become a puppet, doctor

674
00:37:58,167 --> 00:38:00,408
Yes, inside this black heart,
there is a white face

675
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:02,411
If you peel the skin,
you can make out

676
00:38:02,467 --> 00:38:05,175
Buddy, your photo
is coming in TV

677
00:38:06,267 --> 00:38:08,042
You photo looks stylish

678
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:10,171
'- Our leader, Zindabad!
- Our leader, Zindabad!'

679
00:38:10,234 --> 00:38:12,214
- Shut up
- Out of eagerness we shouted

680
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:14,974
Doctor, can you change
that channel with remote?

681
00:38:15,067 --> 00:38:17,411
- Full coverage is shown in-
- Stop it

682
00:38:17,467 --> 00:38:21,347
After doing violence and bomb blast,
are you trying to act smart in hospital?

683
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,009
Gosh!

684
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:27,147
There is deep wound
I think there is fracture

685
00:38:27,234 --> 00:38:28,178
- Gosh!
- Cong rates!

686
00:38:28,233 --> 00:38:30,076
Next week you can head
the handicaps procession

687
00:38:30,167 --> 00:38:31,510
- Shut up
- That's rig ht

688
00:38:31,567 --> 00:38:33,205
What is it?
What is the case?

689
00:38:33,267 --> 00:38:35,372
In the mayor bomb
blast he has got wounded

690
00:38:35,434 --> 00:38:36,606
Send him to Pushpam hospital

691
00:38:36,667 --> 00:38:38,669
Doctor, we can treat him here

692
00:38:38,734 --> 00:38:40,680
Juniors need not interfere
in admission cases

693
00:38:40,734 --> 00:38:43,510
It is critical injury
He'll need treatment

694
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:46,103
You send whoever comes
here to Pushpam hospital

695
00:38:46,167 --> 00:38:47,976
Then what is the need for this hospital?

696
00:38:48,067 --> 00:38:50,274
Not only that
This is a police case

697
00:38:50,367 --> 00:38:52,074
There was information from station

698
00:38:52,134 --> 00:38:54,080
Then you do whatever you want

699
00:38:54,134 --> 00:38:55,579
- Nurse!
- Madam!

700
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:57,544
Gosh!

701
00:38:58,534 --> 00:39:00,377
You take him and
get his x-ray done

702
00:39:00,433 --> 00:39:03,539
- We'll have to put plaster
- Sajjan, first you bath him

703
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:06,240
My duty is over
if they want, they can bath him

704
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:08,405
Someone bath me
and make me lie down

705
00:39:08,467 --> 00:39:12,347
I meant bath me
You go and get my dress from lodge

706
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,209
Be careful with the leg
One person is lying here

707
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:20,008
Why are you rolling in
the ground of the hospital?

708
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:22,512
Go and lie in some temple
Stay there

709
00:39:23,234 --> 00:39:24,679
- Come, come
- What is this?

710
00:39:24,734 --> 00:39:27,647
Is it a hospital or handicapped
people's beggar office?

711
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:29,611
Do not be scared
This is what government hospital is

712
00:39:29,667 --> 00:39:30,372
Enough?

713
00:39:30,434 --> 00:39:31,742
What is that which has
been covered with cloth?

714
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:32,778
That is dead body

715
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,571
Will people who come here
end up in this state?

716
00:39:38,367 --> 00:39:41,314
Stop, stop
Give me my lungi

717
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:44,974
- Gosh!
- Are you not coming?

718
00:39:45,334 --> 00:39:47,211
Don't kill me
Don't kill me

719
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:49,075
Leave, leave
Leave me

720
00:39:49,134 --> 00:39:50,169
Gosh!

721
00:39:50,267 --> 00:39:52,645
- My leg!
- Gosh! Should I lie here?

722
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:56,079
The doctor told you to lie on
the ground under the bed No 18

723
00:39:56,167 --> 00:39:59,478
- On ground?
- Yes, each person is allotted a place

724
00:39:59,533 --> 00:40:01,103
- You lie there
- No chance

725
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,770
if only the bomb had fallen
on my head, I won't...

726
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:03,740
...have had to see all this

727
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,006
- Uncle!
- What is it?

728
00:40:05,067 --> 00:40:08,310
Can you rent out this bed for 2 days?
He must be laid there

729
00:40:08,367 --> 00:40:10,472
- Unfortunate guy
- Go to No 22 bed

730
00:40:10,534 --> 00:40:13,140
That patient
will most probably die today

731
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,339
His family members are
praying whole heanedly

732
00:40:15,434 --> 00:40:16,037
For him to die?

733
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:17,306
This bed is free
You come here

734
00:40:17,367 --> 00:40:20,541
Hey, here it is not possible
It is my mother's bed

735
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:22,773
- She has gone to bathroom
- Sister, is there anyone here?

736
00:40:23,034 --> 00:40:24,479
The person here has gone for x-ray

737
00:40:24,534 --> 00:40:26,377
For the time being
we'll make him lie here

738
00:40:26,434 --> 00:40:28,675
If you had wanted bed, you
should have booked early

739
00:40:28,734 --> 00:40:30,680
if only I had known that there
will be bomb blast, I would...

740
00:40:30,734 --> 00:40:32,407
...have booked from
Palakadu and come

741
00:40:32,467 --> 00:40:33,605
Allahh!!!!

742
00:40:33,667 --> 00:40:35,169
I think someone
in that bed has died

743
00:40:35,234 --> 00:40:37,009
- Let us go there
- No one has died there

744
00:40:37,067 --> 00:40:39,172
He is a priest in mosque so he
calls out off and on like this

745
00:40:39,234 --> 00:40:40,235
Unnecessarily got excited

746
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:42,576
Let us for the time
being make him lie here

747
00:40:42,634 --> 00:40:45,410
- Gosh!
- What is this?

748
00:40:46,167 --> 00:40:49,341
Whose is this?
I think he is dead

749
00:40:49,467 --> 00:40:50,343
Mother!

750
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:52,543
Do one thing
You all leave

751
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,705
Tomorrow morning I'll
arrive with his body

752
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:58,077
- No, I'll come with him
- Let me tell one thing

753
00:40:58,334 --> 00:41:02,180
You go and pacify mother
Not only that

754
00:41:02,234 --> 00:41:04,043
Sarasappa, don't we
have a rally tomorrow?

755
00:41:04,134 --> 00:41:04,441
Yes

756
00:41:04,534 --> 00:41:07,413
Send 100 people for
the pension people's protest

757
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,207
Don't forget to die
the hair white

758
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,712
Not only that
A boy's party is coming to see Sowmya

759
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,308
In that whose hair should I paint white?

760
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,107
You need not paint
anybody's hair white in that

761
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,305
- They'll see her and go away
- That you need not worry

762
00:41:17,367 --> 00:41:19,574
From tomorrow morning
we'll be there in your house

763
00:41:19,633 --> 00:41:22,773
No need! You need not
go to my house at all

764
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,207
Let her get married somehow

765
00:41:26,367 --> 00:41:28,005
I'm telling you also

766
00:41:28,067 --> 00:41:30,172
For God's sake give us
some peace of mind

767
00:41:30,234 --> 00:41:31,076
You leave

768
00:41:31,134 --> 00:41:33,080
We are all there to look after him

769
00:41:33,167 --> 00:41:35,613
- Padmanabha, we have only bought the bed
- Get out

770
00:41:35,667 --> 00:41:39,513
Rest we'll buy and give him
Will you please go away?

771
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:43,412
- There are many heart patients here
- Okay, you all leave

772
00:41:43,467 --> 00:41:45,105
- Let us go
- Go, go

773
00:41:45,167 --> 00:41:47,044
We'll throw stone at you,
if you don't go

774
00:41:47,134 --> 00:41:51,549
Don't mistake them
We are from a Palakadu village

775
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:54,444
You saw now the innocence of village

776
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:57,447
In our side we call such
people as cheap idiots

777
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:01,613
Let us get acquainted in detail

778
00:42:01,767 --> 00:42:04,270
My name is Padmanabhan

779
00:42:07,367 --> 00:42:10,541
- There is no reduction in pain, dear
- Pain

780
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:12,671
While doing bravery act,
you didn't bother about it

781
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,279
Didn't you think of pain that time?

782
00:42:14,334 --> 00:42:15,642
Did you think about hospital?

783
00:42:15,767 --> 00:42:21,046
- Did you think about me?
- Thinking about you only I did this

784
00:42:21,434 --> 00:42:24,677
In 2012 there was Kallai
panchayat office picketing

785
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:28,612
Do you know what is picketing?
He is listening with closed eyes

786
00:42:28,667 --> 00:42:30,578
What will he understand?

787
00:42:30,767 --> 00:42:34,579
I and Kunnumpurathu Mohan were
in the front shouting slogans

788
00:42:34,634 --> 00:42:36,773
We must have gone 200 yards in front

789
00:42:37,034 --> 00:42:39,981
I heard a sound of blast
Hey! Get up from there

790
00:42:40,067 --> 00:42:41,375
What kind of blast is this?

791
00:42:41,434 --> 00:42:44,972
It is from which direction?
What is it?

792
00:42:45,034 --> 00:42:46,775
See how he is lying
Who are you?

793
00:42:47,034 --> 00:42:48,377
Are you God Anantha Padmanabhan?

794
00:42:48,434 --> 00:42:51,608
- No...ordinary Padmanabhan
- What are you doing here?

795
00:42:51,667 --> 00:42:53,271
I came just like that to see a movie

796
00:42:53,334 --> 00:42:55,780
When I went it was houseful
So I thought I'll take some rest

797
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:56,705
- Dear!
- What?

798
00:42:56,767 --> 00:42:59,441
We told you that
time itself, that it's their bed

799
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:03,414
Whatever you may say
No one else can think of lying here

800
00:43:04,367 --> 00:43:08,076
This happened in bomb blast
Don't make me burst

801
00:43:08,134 --> 00:43:10,045
Then you burst
Let me see

802
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:12,603
- Dear! Don't go for fight
-You keep quiet, grand pa

803
00:43:12,667 --> 00:43:14,408
Don't make him cough
when he is ill

804
00:43:14,467 --> 00:43:17,209
If there is authority, a person
can lie on pounding stone also

805
00:43:17,267 --> 00:43:20,009
You can make uncle lie here
I'll adjust

806
00:43:20,067 --> 00:43:22,047
- Isn't that justified, Leelaettathi?
- That is correct

807
00:43:22,134 --> 00:43:23,772
- Grandma, Mamacha, Vasuetta?
- Correct

808
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,038
Did you see?
We are very close friends now

809
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:28,977
The problem is where will you lie

810
00:43:29,034 --> 00:43:30,604
If you want, you can
adjust on this side

811
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:33,010
I'll be squeezed
Even the...

812
00:43:33,067 --> 00:43:35,013
Shut up
Vulgar guy

813
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:38,106
Won't you all allow us to live?

814
00:43:38,167 --> 00:43:41,046
It is due to a guy like you that
this man has become like this

815
00:43:41,134 --> 00:43:43,171
Whatever that Prakashan did,
you are doing the same thing

816
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:44,472
To seize another person's place

817
00:43:44,534 --> 00:43:47,276
We have decided not to
bend before violence any more

818
00:43:47,334 --> 00:43:50,281
You can beat and kill us,
But you can't defeat us

819
00:43:50,334 --> 00:43:52,473
- What is this?
- What is the matter here?

820
00:43:53,367 --> 00:43:56,211
- About whom are you talking?
- Can't you talk without shouting?

821
00:43:56,267 --> 00:43:58,474
It is only because we didn't shout
that we have come to this state

822
00:43:58,534 --> 00:44:00,172
While saying we can say
it is medical college

823
00:44:00,234 --> 00:44:01,713
But there is no water, light or bed

824
00:44:01,767 --> 00:44:03,075
There is problem in that

825
00:44:03,134 --> 00:44:04,977
The crime is that I shouted

826
00:44:05,034 --> 00:44:08,277
First you set right the problems here
After that you can advice people here

827
00:44:08,334 --> 00:44:11,645
Dear! You keep quiet
Is this the way to talk to Thamburati girl?

828
00:44:11,767 --> 00:44:15,271
People born with silver spoon
can't understand the problems of poor

829
00:44:15,367 --> 00:44:17,005
This guy is lying in grandpa's bed

830
00:44:17,067 --> 00:44:18,102
Now what should we do?

831
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:20,043
It is on my saying that
you were admitted here

832
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:22,102
I can discharge you if I want

833
00:44:22,167 --> 00:44:24,374
Is it written anywhere
that it is grandpa's bed?

834
00:44:24,467 --> 00:44:28,506
- Get up from here
- Why do you shout for that?

835
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:33,043
Don't shout, don't shout
I came to give you company

836
00:44:33,134 --> 00:44:34,579
- Who is it?
- Your father

837
00:44:34,634 --> 00:44:38,207
- Is it my late father?
- I'm father's father...g rand father

838
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:49,376
The present Mayor comrade Purushottaman

839
00:44:49,434 --> 00:44:54,179
In the party procession of
yours today there is a doubt...

840
00:44:54,267 --> 00:44:57,476
...that some drama was involved in it

841
00:44:57,567 --> 00:44:58,341
Isn't it?

842
00:44:58,434 --> 00:45:00,471
Don't you also have that doubt, Mohan sir?

843
00:45:00,533 --> 00:45:03,514
I promise on my mother that
it is an internal drama only

844
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:06,479
The opposition party can't
do anything to...nothing to me...

845
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:11,142
I'm not able to speak

846
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:12,304
Whatever it may be

847
00:45:12,367 --> 00:45:15,280
It is a drama to murder me

848
00:45:15,334 --> 00:45:18,144
It is not our style to
finish a person physically

849
00:45:18,234 --> 00:45:20,714
- Don't talk nonsense
- Don't get agitated

850
00:45:21,767 --> 00:45:25,214
We need to go to some
pictures taken during the incident

851
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:29,610
You were in the front of the procession
But suddenly you backed up

852
00:45:29,667 --> 00:45:30,975
No, you retreated

853
00:45:31,067 --> 00:45:33,604
It is at that time that
the bomb blasted

854
00:45:33,667 --> 00:45:38,616
I got an urgent call from my wife
To hear that clearly I retreated

855
00:45:38,667 --> 00:45:41,546
My God! If the call had not
come at the correct time

856
00:45:41,634 --> 00:45:43,580
- My chapter would have been closed
- Okay, Mr. Mayor!

857
00:45:43,633 --> 00:45:46,773
The witness to this incident,
who got wounded in this blast

858
00:45:47,034 --> 00:45:49,139
Sri Padmanabhan is joining
in line with us from...

859
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:52,204
...Government medical college

860
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:54,302
- Reema, are you ready?
- Yes, sir

861
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:59,008
Mr. Padmanabhan!
You are the eye the stadium bomb blast

862
00:45:59,067 --> 00:46:02,378
I'm not a person who saw
I'm a person who got it

863
00:46:02,434 --> 00:46:04,345
Do you see here?
It is totally damaged

864
00:46:04,433 --> 00:46:07,607
We have very little time
Please, say it briefly

865
00:46:07,733 --> 00:46:08,404
okay

866
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:11,037
Do I need to talk in your
language or my language?

867
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:11,703
What do you mean?

868
00:46:11,767 --> 00:46:14,771
You TV people talk in peculiar
style in children's programme

869
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:19,710
We huge people were coming
as procession with puppets

870
00:46:19,767 --> 00:46:22,509
Mayor threw my phone on
ground in the middle of the crowd

871
00:46:22,567 --> 00:46:25,605
While I was collecting my phone
I saw a bal coming towards me

872
00:46:25,667 --> 00:46:28,273
Thinking that it is
football I defended with my leg

873
00:46:28,367 --> 00:46:30,108
It was at that time
the blast took place

874
00:46:30,167 --> 00:46:32,374
Mr. Padmanabhan, will
you talk a bit decently?

875
00:46:32,467 --> 00:46:34,606
- Okay, I'll tell
- Yes tell me

876
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:38,076
Move this

877
00:46:38,667 --> 00:46:42,308
Whatever happened is
a pan of conspiracy

878
00:46:43,134 --> 00:46:47,014
Does he know everything?
Don't ask me what the conspiracy is

879
00:46:47,067 --> 00:46:48,239
- It is a big secret
- God!

880
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:51,509
Being a party member of
Mayor isn't it your duty to explain that?

881
00:46:51,567 --> 00:46:56,016
Mayor's party member and me?
I met him for the first time here

882
00:46:56,067 --> 00:46:58,104
- Madam, didn't you see
the procession today?

883
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:00,202
All those who participated
in that were imported

884
00:47:00,267 --> 00:47:02,474
- Imported?
- Yes, imported

885
00:47:02,567 --> 00:47:05,241
That Mayor has no influence here
He doesn't have much of his men

886
00:47:05,333 --> 00:47:10,009
So people like us have been
imported from many places for wages

887
00:47:10,067 --> 00:47:12,775
Then we'll be given biryani
We belong to no political party

888
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,708
But this city is
really bad

889
00:47:15,767 --> 00:47:17,212
It is stinking

890
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:21,214
On getting hurt in bomb blast,
I wanted to go back to my place

891
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:25,238
I'm waiting here for
the police enquiry to get over

892
00:47:25,434 --> 00:47:27,778
Not knowing I'm asking this

893
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:32,710
In this city this is the main hospital
Is this what you call as hospital?

894
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:35,303
- Isn't this Padmanabhan?
- This whole area has problem

895
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:37,744
When I was brought to this hospital,
do you know what the doctor said?

896
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:41,646
He said the treatment here
is not good and...

897
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:43,976
I should get admitted in Pushpam hospital

898
00:47:44,034 --> 00:47:45,513
Not knowing I'm asking this

899
00:47:45,567 --> 00:47:49,276
Is this Pushpam hospital a part
of government hospital?

900
00:47:49,667 --> 00:47:51,442
The patients of this hospital...

901
00:47:51,534 --> 00:47:52,740
One minute, one minute
Come, come

902
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:55,178
There are many characters here
Let us put all of them in camera

903
00:47:55,234 --> 00:47:57,578
- It is not possible
- You first speak

904
00:47:57,634 --> 00:48:02,242
He is this girl's grand father
She is his grand daughter

905
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:04,541
Who is trying to grab your land?

906
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:06,102
Tell, tell the name

907
00:48:06,367 --> 00:48:08,244
- Prakashan
- Prakashan! Prakashan!

908
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:10,280
It is due to that Prakashan,
they are on road

909
00:48:10,334 --> 00:48:12,644
- Please!
- On the roads

910
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:16,741
Hello! How long is it
since I'm calling you?

911
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:19,076
Where are you?
What happened to you?

912
00:48:19,134 --> 00:48:20,579
I have no peace, God

913
00:48:20,634 --> 00:48:24,138
Mother, there is nothing
serious here as you think

914
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:26,771
What you saw in TV was political game

915
00:48:27,434 --> 00:48:30,040
Sarasappan and Komalan
have left to there

916
00:48:30,134 --> 00:48:33,308
Mother, if I was serious,
would they come there?

917
00:48:33,434 --> 00:48:36,005
I have to get the money of all
those who came here with me

918
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:37,579
Without that how can I come there?

919
00:48:37,634 --> 00:48:39,671
After taking that
money I'll reach there

920
00:48:40,067 --> 00:48:42,513
Mother, this is not marriage

921
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:45,706
During the time when boy's
party come to see her I'll reach there

922
00:48:46,033 --> 00:48:49,173
Mother! Hello!
There is no range here

923
00:48:49,233 --> 00:48:50,576
I'll call you in the morning

924
00:48:50,634 --> 00:48:52,671
Hang up the phone
You sleep

925
00:48:53,534 --> 00:48:55,275
Nonsense

926
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:59,448
- Dear, the marriage is not mine
- It is my sister's

927
00:48:59,534 --> 00:49:00,512
Did I ask you?

928
00:49:00,567 --> 00:49:04,777
As a bachelor, it is
my duty to inform that

929
00:49:08,134 --> 00:49:09,078
- Madam!
- What?

930
00:49:09,134 --> 00:49:11,478
- Did the first floor grandpa sleep?
- No

931
00:49:11,567 --> 00:49:14,013
- He is standing upside down
- Is it?

932
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:17,170
He is sleeping

933
00:49:17,234 --> 00:49:18,577
- Is it?
- Yes

934
00:49:18,634 --> 00:49:19,442
Shut up

935
00:49:43,134 --> 00:49:45,205
Why did you keep the candle here?

936
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:49,339
On seeing your face,
I felt like seeing Mother Mary

937
00:49:49,434 --> 00:49:52,415
Sol lit this candle
I felt happiness in heart

938
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:54,104
Due to that...

939
00:49:54,267 --> 00:49:56,338
Damn his happiness!

940
00:50:03,567 --> 00:50:10,143
- Can't you sleep?
- I have lost my sleep, dear

941
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:13,638
- Nuisance!
- Dear!

942
00:50:13,767 --> 00:50:16,213
What are you doing?
Move that side

943
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:19,281
- I'm not a problem maker
- On seeing anyone will say

944
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:22,643
- Dear, are you the only one?
- No, there are many here

945
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:24,771
- Do you want me to wake them up?
- Not that

946
00:50:25,034 --> 00:50:27,571
Are you the only
daughter of your parents?

947
00:50:27,634 --> 00:50:30,478
- No, there are 100 of us
- Then is your father...

948
00:50:30,567 --> 00:50:33,309
- Drithurashter and mother Gandhari?
- No, Kunthi

949
00:50:33,367 --> 00:50:36,041
Kunthi?!
She has spread darkness

950
00:50:36,167 --> 00:50:38,272
Then her mother is only Gandhari

951
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,640
You have bath and come later on
Now you can leave

952
00:51:10,633 --> 00:51:14,308
- Gosh! Rat
- Don't be scared

953
00:51:14,367 --> 00:51:16,574
There is a snake in this block
That will eat this rat

954
00:51:16,667 --> 00:51:18,647
What? What happened?

955
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:22,170
I dreamt of my leg getting
caught in a sewing machine

956
00:51:22,234 --> 00:51:24,043
But it was rat which was biting

957
00:51:25,434 --> 00:51:27,175
I'll go to toilet and come

958
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:30,376
You have had a fracture,
so there must be swelling

959
00:51:30,467 --> 00:51:32,674
Don't put pressure on that leg
I'll help you

960
00:51:32,734 --> 00:51:36,011
Thank you, uncle
I have to go to toilet

961
00:51:36,067 --> 00:51:38,013
There is no water in
the toilet of this block

962
00:51:38,167 --> 00:51:39,510
You'll have to go to the next block

963
00:51:39,567 --> 00:51:40,978
At any cost I have to go

964
00:51:41,067 --> 00:51:42,341
Grandpa!

965
00:51:43,167 --> 00:51:45,477
Does she have
any problem of screaming?

966
00:51:45,534 --> 00:51:48,606
Are you working in firework company?
Yesterday also I head the sound of blast

967
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:50,043
What are you
doing this, grandpa?

968
00:51:50,133 --> 00:51:51,271
If your stitch cuts open?

969
00:51:51,334 --> 00:51:54,144
Madam, I was helping
your grandpa

970
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:55,543
To get up holding me

971
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:59,275
Padmanabhan has problem in getting up
That is the only problem that I have

972
00:51:59,334 --> 00:52:01,712
Hasn't doctor Thomas told
you not to strain your body?

973
00:52:01,767 --> 00:52:04,611
Hasn't Dr. Am bed kar said
that we should help others?

974
00:52:04,667 --> 00:52:06,738
- What?
- Help me, madam

975
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:08,404
Help him, dear

976
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:11,709
How'll he go till the next
block with this injured leg?

977
00:52:11,767 --> 00:52:14,270
He is also a human like us

978
00:52:14,334 --> 00:52:15,642
- So what?
- No need, grandpa

979
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:17,543
My mother has told
that we are only there for us...

980
00:52:17,633 --> 00:52:19,237
...and there is
only pillar for house

981
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:22,543
Madam, when you have a bomb
injury in your leg, you'll understand

982
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:26,742
The pain of this one leg
If you are reluctant to hold me, no need

983
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:29,337
<i>- I'll</i> hold you
- What is this?

984
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:30,970
Don't push me

985
00:52:31,034 --> 00:52:35,710
I won't have troubled you
We can control anything

986
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:39,043
Hunger, thirst, anger,
sorrow, happiness

987
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:40,602
All that we can control

988
00:52:40,667 --> 00:52:43,341
But if we have
a problem in back engine...

989
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:45,471
...the control is
not in our hand

990
00:52:45,567 --> 00:52:48,639
- Come and drop me in bathroom
- Go with him, dear

991
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:51,738
Come...I'll hold you
Don't get angry

992
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,002
If I had been like this permanently,
it would have been good

993
00:52:54,067 --> 00:52:57,514
- Can I keep my hand here?
- Don't make me slap you

994
00:52:57,567 --> 00:53:00,241
Morning a bed coffee
is a must for me

995
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:04,339
- Then don't you want newspaper?
- Have you understood my habits?

996
00:53:04,434 --> 00:53:05,538
What?

997
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:08,511
- Sorry
- Thanks

998
00:53:08,567 --> 00:53:09,307
Leave me

999
00:53:09,367 --> 00:53:11,313
Your thoughts are not clean
You go alone

1000
00:53:11,367 --> 00:53:16,680
Madam, from the ribs of
men god has created women

1001
00:53:16,733 --> 00:53:19,077
When one of my bone broke,
I asked you for help

1002
00:53:19,134 --> 00:53:20,977
You don't have
common consideration

1003
00:53:21,067 --> 00:53:23,172
No need! I don't
want anyone's help

1004
00:53:23,234 --> 00:53:27,205
Let me see if I can go alone
You'll regret for this, madam

1005
00:53:32,234 --> 00:53:34,475
I have to behave
like an auto rickshaw

1006
00:53:34,534 --> 00:53:36,138
He is too much

1007
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:40,307
- Mother! Why did you scream?
- Get up, get up

1008
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:42,470
Come

1009
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:45,510
It is lucky to get a shoulder
to which we can hold on

1010
00:53:45,567 --> 00:53:47,979
if you don't walk properly,
I'll hit you

1011
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:50,580
<i>- Suresh Gap?!
- Ne, Bharat Gem</i>

1012
00:53:53,034 --> 00:53:56,174
Here also beverages queue?
What a big queue

1013
00:53:56,234 --> 00:53:58,407
Do they take liquor
in bucket from here?

1014
00:53:58,467 --> 00:54:00,743
This is not beverage, it is toilet

1015
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:02,575
If you want, you stand

1016
00:54:06,367 --> 00:54:09,007
- Why did you push and enter?
- I don't know anything

1017
00:54:09,067 --> 00:54:10,740
Are they distributing
some sweet here?

1018
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:13,974
- Is there any other toilet here?
-Adog has delivered there

1019
00:54:14,067 --> 00:54:15,444
Which relative of
yours has delivered?

1020
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:16,774
Dog, it has delivered

1021
00:54:17,034 --> 00:54:19,139
In medical college's
toilet has dog delivered?

1022
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:21,043
I can't stand anymore

1023
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:22,636
Take me to superintendent's room

1024
00:54:22,700 --> 00:54:26,307
First a hospital needs a clean
toilet where there is no queue

1025
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:28,277
You drop me in
superintendent's room fast

1026
00:54:28,334 --> 00:54:29,574
I must get a clear answer today

1027
00:54:29,667 --> 00:54:30,645
What do you want to know?

1028
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:33,044
I told you that my today's
duty time is over

1029
00:54:33,134 --> 00:54:34,169
How can you say like this?

1030
00:54:34,234 --> 00:54:36,236
My mother is suffering
there unable to breathe

1031
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:39,713
- You have to come and attend her
- During admission time I told you

1032
00:54:40,034 --> 00:54:42,446
If you want special care,
you take her to some private hospital

1033
00:54:42,534 --> 00:54:45,105
Whatever it is, I can't
attend to her today

1034
00:54:45,167 --> 00:54:48,239
Without examining the patients here
I know where you are going

1035
00:54:48,334 --> 00:54:49,745
Are you not going to
Prakashan's hospital?

1036
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:52,508
Special consulting
You'll get extra commission there

1037
00:54:52,567 --> 00:54:55,309
How does it matter to you?
If you try to shine here more...

1038
00:54:55,367 --> 00:54:57,313
...you'll take only your
mother's dead body from here

1039
00:54:57,367 --> 00:54:58,277
I'm telling you this

1040
00:54:58,367 --> 00:54:59,175
Hey!

1041
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,604
Thank you, doctor

1042
00:55:01,667 --> 00:55:05,513
- You should do like that
- Subhair, what is the problem?

1043
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:07,409
- This guy...
- Will you hit a doctor?

1044
00:55:07,467 --> 00:55:08,537
If you misbehave,
I'll hit you

1045
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:11,342
Doctor, in ward 13 one
patient is very serious

1046
00:55:11,434 --> 00:55:12,606
Let the patient die there

1047
00:55:12,667 --> 00:55:14,977
Today no one
will treat anyone here

1048
00:55:15,067 --> 00:55:17,240
Will you hit the hospital
superintendent?

1049
00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:19,007
<i>- I'll</i> show you
- You show me

1050
00:55:19,567 --> 00:55:21,240
Hello, I'm Tony Jacob

1051
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:24,247
God! This rat is the secretary
of doctors association

1052
00:55:24,334 --> 00:55:26,780
Now today all
hospitals will go on strike

1053
00:55:33,233 --> 00:55:35,975
'Today again doctors in
Kerala have gone on strike'

1054
00:55:36,033 --> 00:55:38,309
'This was on the instruction
of the secretary Tony Jacob'

1055
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:43,679
'He had a fight with one
of the patient's relative'

1056
00:55:51,034 --> 00:55:55,414
My goodness! Is it Karadi?
He'll create a commotion here

1057
00:55:58,667 --> 00:56:00,669
What Padmanabhan said is correct

1058
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:03,304
There is no need for us
to lose like that

1059
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:05,209
Who is Subhair?

1060
00:56:07,767 --> 00:56:10,509
Who is that Subhair,
who hit the doctor?

1061
00:56:12,634 --> 00:56:14,477
- Is it you?
-It is not me, sir

1062
00:56:14,534 --> 00:56:16,309
- Then who is it?
-It is me, sir

1063
00:56:16,367 --> 00:56:17,471
Come here

1064
00:56:17,534 --> 00:56:19,514
My son didn't do
anything wrong, sir

1065
00:56:19,567 --> 00:56:21,103
He is innocent

1066
00:56:21,734 --> 00:56:25,011
Save him somehow

1067
00:56:25,267 --> 00:56:27,543
- You are smart
- Sir, I...

1068
00:56:27,633 --> 00:56:28,373
- What?
- Sir...

1069
00:56:28,467 --> 00:56:31,448
What ever it is,
what you did was right

1070
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:35,747
It is their hobby to do
strike for each and everything

1071
00:56:36,267 --> 00:56:38,440
I have also felt like hitting them

1072
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:42,773
But due to this problem you
created all the hospitals...

1073
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,412
...work in Kerala has
come to a stand still

1074
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:47,070
You go and say sorry

1075
00:56:47,134 --> 00:56:48,374
The problem will get solved

1076
00:56:48,434 --> 00:56:51,278
-it is not possible, sir
- What did you say?

1077
00:56:52,734 --> 00:56:54,645
Not possible

1078
00:56:56,734 --> 00:56:57,644
Who are you?

1079
00:56:57,700 --> 00:56:59,702
Don't you know him, sir?
He has come in TV

1080
00:56:59,767 --> 00:57:02,646
The one who took the bomb
which was aimed at Mayor

1081
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:06,341
Sir, you said that
what he is was justified

1082
00:57:07,034 --> 00:57:11,483
Isn't it wrong to say sorry
for an act which is justified?

1083
00:57:12,367 --> 00:57:14,438
Sir, we look up
to doctor as God

1084
00:57:14,534 --> 00:57:18,141
But some people in that, I must
not say but still I have to say

1085
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:19,770
- They are devils
- Yes, sir

1086
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,502
I can understand
what you are saying

1087
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:26,140
As a Cl to this medical college,
I have to find a solution to this problem

1088
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:28,646
Doctor's strike is very strong

1089
00:57:28,700 --> 00:57:30,976
The procession and
commotion will start soon

1090
00:57:31,033 --> 00:57:34,344
But before their procession starts,
we'll start our procession

1091
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:35,174
What?

1092
00:57:35,234 --> 00:57:38,738
For the first time in Kerala
patients are going to come together

1093
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:42,042
- That is what we lack
- Doctors can do strike

1094
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:43,511
Nurses can do strike

1095
00:57:43,567 --> 00:57:46,309
Then why can't we
patients do strike?

1096
00:57:46,367 --> 00:57:49,974
Till today I have done strike and
shouted slogans for only others

1097
00:57:50,067 --> 00:57:53,048
This is the first time I'm
going to do strike for myself

1098
00:57:53,134 --> 00:57:54,579
- All patients!
- Zindabad!

1099
00:57:54,667 --> 00:57:57,341
Stop, stop
You are smart

1100
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:59,107
- What did you say your name is?
- Padmanabhan

1101
00:57:59,167 --> 00:57:59,736
Did I ask you?

1102
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:02,781
If you ask him, then also
he'll say Padmanabhan

1103
00:58:03,467 --> 00:58:05,140
- Padmanabhan
- Yes!

1104
00:58:05,234 --> 00:58:06,611

So, I won't say bye

1146

It is due to your arrival that
this hell became a hospital

1147

To tell the truth I forgot all
these days that I'm a heart patient

That pain won't come back, Mamachaya

...protest, look after
your health also

Against the chief minister there is
a protest in secretariat next month

For that I'll be again
coming to this city with my men

- Let us meet that day
- Are you leaving, Padmanabhan?

Yes, I'm leaving

1156

Before going I have to meet
2 to 3 people more

1157

I have to get money from them

1158

Next time when you come to the capital,
you must come to the palace

01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:02,243
My uncle Thirumanasu wanted to meet
the person who cleaned up this hospital

1160
01:03:02,300 --> 01:03:04,041
Okay
Surely I'll come...once

1161
01:03:04,100 --> 01:03:07,673
I saw him like lightening
I also want to meet him

1162
01:03:07,734 --> 01:03:09,975
I'll leave now
Bye!

01:03:10,067 --> 01:03:11,978
- Damodaran brother!
- What is it, Vasuetta?

1164
01:03:12,034 --> 01:03:13,672
One of you come there immediately

1165
01:03:13,734 --> 01:03:17,648
- Tell me what is the matter?
- Those rowdies are demolishing your house

1166
01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:25,506
- Throw everything
- Give way

My Sri padmanabha!

Kill me

be full of problem

1172
01:03:49,467 --> 01:03:52,038
Make him sit somewhere there

1173
01:03:52,100 --> 01:03:54,341
What are you doing this?
This is not the way to behave with women

1174
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:56,209
Who the hell are you to say that?

1175
01:03:59,567 --> 01:04:02,446
Are you not ashamed being a Malayali?

1176
01:04:02,500 --> 01:04:04,502
If this was happening
in your house, will you

1177
01:04:04,567 --> 01:04:06,274
stand like this taking
picture in mobile?

1178
01:04:06,334 --> 01:04:08,644
When someone's mother becomes mad,
it is interesting to see

1179
01:04:08,734 --> 01:04:09,735
People without conscious

1180
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:11,070
Switch that off

1181
01:04:15,267 --> 01:04:16,075
Get up

1182
01:04:19,034 --> 01:04:22,481
We village people
pledge only silver and gold

1183
01:04:22,533 --> 01:04:26,777
Only in city there are people
like you who pledge their back bone

1184
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,537
Fearing five people five
hundred people are standing

1185
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:33,441
it was you who boosted in
hospital that you'll hit and kill

1186
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:35,571
Now when a problem has arisen
are you standing like coward?

1187
01:04:35,634 --> 01:04:37,978
Nowl'm not a guy of this city

1188
01:04:38,234 --> 01:04:40,680
Are you not ashamed?
Do I belong to this city?

1189
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:42,711
A man of courage
dies only once in life

1190
01:04:42,767 --> 01:04:46,146
A man without respect will be
dying each and every minute

1191
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:47,702
I have heard my father
giving speech like this

1192
01:04:47,767 --> 01:04:49,371
Atongue which can't
protest and a hand which

1193
01:04:49,434 --> 01:04:51,675
can't lift is an identification of slavery

1194
01:05:15,534 --> 01:05:17,775
Leave me, leave me

1195
01:05:47,067 --> 01:05:48,273
What is it?
What is the matter here?

1196
01:05:48,367 --> 01:05:51,041
While going to the office I
heard that a fight was going on here

1197
01:05:51,100 --> 01:05:53,478
- What is the problem?
- Mayor sir, I'll tell you

1198
01:05:53,567 --> 01:05:57,777
- Are you not the guy with clip board?
- No, bomb

1199
01:05:58,034 --> 01:05:59,274
Why are you roaming around here?

1200
01:05:59,334 --> 01:06:00,404
Are you not going back
to your native place?

1201
01:06:00,500 --> 01:06:01,535
I was leaving to my place, sir

1202
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:03,341
It was at that time that I heard
goons were trying

1203
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:05,380
to demolish his house

1204
01:06:05,434 --> 01:06:10,247
Sol also came with them here
Then I interfered in the matter

1205
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:12,541
Due to that my leg has
again got into problem

1206
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:14,102
I was about to meet you, sir

1207
01:06:14,167 --> 01:06:15,976
You have to pay me for
the procession of that day

1208
01:06:16,033 --> 01:06:18,035
- After this you need not expect all that
- Then my money?

1209
01:06:18,100 --> 01:06:19,773
I take action directly for
the fight that took place here

1210
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,571
I promise that I'll take action
Election is nearing

1211
01:06:22,633 --> 01:06:23,976
So don't think I'm doing this for that

1212
01:06:24,034 --> 01:06:25,536
I'm on the side of the people

1213
01:06:25,600 --> 01:06:28,410
- Where are they? Where?
- There

1214
01:06:30,234 --> 01:06:32,305
God! How did they reach there?

1215
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:36,404
Bring them down

1216
01:06:36,467 --> 01:06:39,277
I'll take them to police
station and get them bashed up

1217
01:06:39,334 --> 01:06:42,281
Bring them down
Bring them down

1218
01:06:57,167 --> 01:07:01,138
Dogs, you have grown up
eating my waste

1219
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:03,646
Eating my food are you opposing me?

1220
01:07:03,700 --> 01:07:05,407
Till yesterday you
used to wag your tail

1221
01:07:05,467 --> 01:07:08,380
- Have you started to bark now?
- You leave, boss

1222
01:07:08,434 --> 01:07:10,539
- I'll handle this
- Shut up and go

1223
01:07:10,734 --> 01:07:13,681
I know what has to
be done with you all

1224
01:07:13,767 --> 01:07:17,010
Who is it? Who is it?
Who is it behind you?

1225
01:07:17,300 --> 01:07:19,610
Seeing whom did you
get so much arrogance?

1226
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:24,640
Go in front

1227
01:07:27,267 --> 01:07:28,507
Who are you?

1228
01:07:28,567 --> 01:07:29,705
Who are you?

1229
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:34,972
- Are you the lion of Tamil Nadu?
- Yes, I'm a lion

1230
01:07:35,334 --> 01:07:37,177
Do you know with whom
you are clashing?

1231
01:07:37,234 --> 01:07:39,145
How am I bothered who
you are?

1232
01:07:39,234 --> 01:07:40,679
This is Kerala

1233
01:07:40,734 --> 01:07:43,146
Don't act smart coming
here from Tamil Nadu

1234
01:07:44,267 --> 01:07:46,406
Hey! Measure your words and talk

1235
01:07:46,467 --> 01:07:47,673
News?
Is it All India Radio?

1236
01:07:47,733 --> 01:07:49,576
To measure is it ration shop?

1237
01:07:49,634 --> 01:07:53,275
If I don't measure and talk,
will you chop off my nose?

1238
01:07:53,367 --> 01:07:56,075
What is this? Is it magical ring?

1239
01:07:56,134 --> 01:07:59,308
See the necklace that he is wearing
in neck and the chain in his hand

1240
01:07:59,367 --> 01:08:01,574
Is he a mobile jewelry?

1241
01:08:02,234 --> 01:08:05,545
Why don't you wear
a neck tie and coat and roam like a puppet

1242
01:08:10,300 --> 01:08:12,337
- Hey!
- What, hey?

1243
01:08:12,734 --> 01:08:15,613
Come...if you have courage,
fight with a true man

1244
01:08:16,467 --> 01:08:20,540
lfl snap a finger, it is
equal to snapping thousand fingers

1245
01:08:24,767 --> 01:08:27,509
We'll count from 1 to 5

1246
01:08:27,700 --> 01:08:30,010
By then if you don't get inside
your car and go,

1247
01:08:30,100 --> 01:08:32,580
then you won't be able
to go from here in this birth

1248
01:08:32,667 --> 01:08:34,613
- One
- One

1249
01:08:36,100 --> 01:08:38,580
- Two
- Two

1250
01:08:39,267 --> 01:08:41,178
Boss, people here know
counting till five

1251
01:08:41,234 --> 01:08:42,338
Let us leave from here

1252
01:08:47,767 --> 01:08:48,973
Get lost

1253
01:08:56,500 --> 01:08:58,070
Drop me down
Drop me down

1254
01:08:58,167 --> 01:09:00,977
- My leg
- You are the real man

1255
01:09:01,034 --> 01:09:03,640
Rascal, Mayor!
Did you see his double face?

1256
01:09:03,700 --> 01:09:06,044
Is he a Mayor?

1257
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:08,011
With the help of our vote, he won

1258
01:09:08,067 --> 01:09:10,775
Now he is going behind him like a dog

1259
01:09:11,467 --> 01:09:14,277
What connection does Mayor
have with that Tamilian?

1260
01:09:14,334 --> 01:09:16,712
Tamilian?
Don't you know who he is?

1261
01:09:16,767 --> 01:09:21,238
- He is Prakashan boss
- Prakashan boss

1262
01:09:21,534 --> 01:09:23,571
It is he who rules
Trivandrum today

1263
01:09:23,733 --> 01:09:26,304
Ministers and Mayor are his dogs

1264
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:32,351
God! Is he the guy who called
us for the procession of Mayor?

1265
01:09:32,634 --> 01:09:37,105
- These goons are his henchmen
- My Mulankothu Goddess!

1266
01:09:37,367 --> 01:09:39,779
Did I put my hand inside snake pit?

1267
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,707
- What is it? Are you scared?
- No

1268
01:09:41,767 --> 01:09:44,373
We opposed him expecting
your support Padmanabhan

1269
01:09:44,433 --> 01:09:44,740
okay

1270
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:48,174
- Don't give up us
- I'm not scared

1271
01:09:49,333 --> 01:09:53,179
This guy had to give me some money
as I brought men for his procession

1272
01:09:53,634 --> 01:09:55,511
Now how will I get that from him?

1273
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:57,671
Without that how'll I go back to my place?

1274
01:09:57,767 --> 01:10:00,247
God! I'm caught

1275
01:10:10,367 --> 01:10:15,578
I don't want this shin and dhoti

1276
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:24,646
- No need! It is insulting
- Hubby, what happened to you?

1277
01:10:24,701 --> 01:10:25,543
Have you gone mad?

1278
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:29,047
In front of everyone in West
Fort colony I stood like this only

1279
01:10:29,134 --> 01:10:32,638
- God!
- As if I had no dress on my body

1280
01:10:33,334 --> 01:10:37,282
When I have no respect and virtue,
why do I need dress?

1281
01:10:37,367 --> 01:10:40,177
- What happened, Philipose?
- What is the matter, boss?

1282
01:10:40,234 --> 01:10:44,979
Go, get out
Go...stop there

1283
01:10:45,401 --> 01:10:47,210
Why are you going out?

1284
01:10:47,301 --> 01:10:49,645
- Fearing me?
- Yes, boss

1285
01:10:49,701 --> 01:10:52,978
But that colony people
lost the fear on me

1286
01:10:53,034 --> 01:10:55,742
In future if I scream, they'll only laugh

1287
01:10:56,067 --> 01:10:57,171
Yes

1288
01:10:57,267 --> 01:10:59,770
Our investment is the fear
that others have on us

1289
01:11:00,034 --> 01:11:01,741
If that fear is lost,
everything is lost

1290
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:03,746
Did they grow so much?
Then we must see that

1291
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:05,473
Come, sir
Let us go to that colony

1292
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:06,642
For what?

1293
01:11:06,734 --> 01:11:08,509
To stand on the top of the roof?

1294
01:11:08,567 --> 01:11:11,776
Yes, they lifted our Kannappan
and men on top of the crane

1295
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:15,447
- Is he such a big shot?
- That is the biggest insult to me

1296
01:11:15,501 --> 01:11:18,778
If it had been Balaji
group's Shetty also, it is okay

1297
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:20,741
A guy who is not this much of my finger

1298
01:11:20,801 --> 01:11:22,712
A handicapped who hopes like this

1299
01:11:22,767 --> 01:11:24,303
A useless guy who collects crowd

1300
01:11:24,434 --> 01:11:26,539
I called him for Rs 650

1301
01:11:26,601 --> 01:11:29,707
Who is the one who snaps
finger like this?

1302
01:11:29,767 --> 01:11:32,577
Who? Who?
Yes, Bhasmasuran

1303
01:11:32,667 --> 01:11:35,204
The one who
burnt the person who gave boon

1304
01:11:35,734 --> 01:11:38,476
Like that he pointed
at me with the finger

1305
01:11:38,567 --> 01:11:42,071
I got burnt standing in that colony

1306
01:11:43,034 --> 01:11:46,015
The finger and hand
which pointed at me

1307
01:11:46,100 --> 01:11:49,707
The body which holds that
hand should not remain any more

1308
01:11:49,767 --> 01:11:51,644
It should go to pieces like this

1309
01:11:51,734 --> 01:11:58,049
Great, great Leader!
Bravely you can rule

1310
01:11:58,134 --> 01:11:59,511
Padmanabhan leader!

1311
01:11:59,567 --> 01:12:01,638
There are lakhs of people behind you
You can rule bravely

1312
01:12:01,700 --> 01:12:05,045
Stop, stop...stop
Stop these children

1313
01:12:05,100 --> 01:12:07,273
Without disgracing me,
please go away

1314
01:12:07,367 --> 01:12:09,108
- We are your fans brother
-Fans?

1315
01:12:09,167 --> 01:12:12,046
- Your today's performance was superb
- God!

1316
01:12:12,100 --> 01:12:13,977
- Will you come to school tomorrow?
- For what?

1317
01:12:14,034 --> 01:12:18,676
- To hit our Maths teacher
<i>- I'll</i> hityou...am I a goon?

1318
01:12:20,234 --> 01:12:23,078
Nowl understand
the thickness of the leaders skin...

1319
01:12:23,134 --> 01:12:25,546
...who hire men to
shout slogans for them

1320
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:27,443
- What is it, Padmanabha?
- Nothing

1321
01:12:27,534 --> 01:12:29,536
While coming from
junction these children

1322
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:31,671
came behind me saying
they are my fans

1323
01:12:31,734 --> 01:12:34,237
Not only the children
We are also your fans

1324
01:12:34,300 --> 01:12:34,744
Fans?

1325
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:36,336
Yes, admirer of yours

1326
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:40,246
Brother, I want to go home
so you must give me hand

1327
01:12:40,300 --> 01:12:43,543
Before I give you hand,
you take off this hand of yours

1328
01:12:44,067 --> 01:12:47,708
It is not possible
First let this situation cool off

1329
01:12:48,167 --> 01:12:51,148
Let us see whether that Prakashan
and his henchmen come here again

1330
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:53,305
Then we can decide
Is that enough?

1331
01:12:53,367 --> 01:12:55,574
Then I'm caught Mr. Padmanabha

1332
01:12:55,634 --> 01:12:57,375
Are you standing here?

1333
01:12:58,167 --> 01:13:00,704
Come Hasn't doctor told you not to
put mush pressure on that leg

1334
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:02,370
- Madam, let me tell you
- No need

1335
01:13:02,434 --> 01:13:03,572
What ever has to be said,
we'll say

1336
01:13:03,634 --> 01:13:05,170
You just obey, Pappetta

1337
01:13:06,167 --> 01:13:08,408
- Pappettan?
- Yes, Pappettan

1338
01:13:15,434 --> 01:13:16,242
Go, man

1339
01:13:16,300 --> 01:13:17,335
What are you doing this?

1340
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:20,074
There is only 1/2kg
I must measure as 1kg and give

1341
01:13:22,401 --> 01:13:25,610
Isn't it wrong to keep
a young guy at home?

1342
01:13:25,667 --> 01:13:27,237
If you don't talk carefully, you are...

1343
01:13:27,301 --> 01:13:29,008
...bound to again get wounded, Padmanabhan

1344
01:13:29,067 --> 01:13:30,671
Now suddenly are you
calling me as Padmanabhan?

1345
01:13:30,734 --> 01:13:31,644
I'll call as I feel like

1346
01:13:31,700 --> 01:13:34,442
I'll call Padma,
Pappi, Pappa or Pappu

1347
01:13:34,500 --> 01:13:35,501
What will you do?

1348
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:37,643
- Do you have spicy chilli?
- Here?

1349
01:13:37,700 --> 01:13:38,337
Yes

1350
01:13:38,434 --> 01:13:40,141
- What is the cost of that for 1 kg?
- Rs 120

1351
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:42,407
Then you weigh this
and give me the money?

1352
01:13:42,467 --> 01:13:45,346
- You, idiot!
- Why are you throwing this?

1353
01:13:46,567 --> 01:13:48,740
- Padmanabha!
- Do you know me, sir?

1354
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:51,610
- Are you my fan?
- Of course, you are famous here

1355
01:13:51,667 --> 01:13:53,146
What is this?

1356
01:13:53,200 --> 01:13:55,339
- You must come to the station
- For what?

1357
01:13:55,400 --> 01:13:58,040
In that day's bomb case,
we want your statement

1358
01:13:58,100 --> 01:13:59,101
Thanks a lot

1359
01:13:59,167 --> 01:14:00,237
If you take my statement,

1360
01:14:00,300 --> 01:14:02,177
I can go back
to my native place

1361
01:14:02,634 --> 01:14:05,740
Are you coming with me?
We can go to the station and come

1362
01:14:06,167 --> 01:14:08,238
Sir, let us go via that Kezhakekodu

1363
01:14:08,301 --> 01:14:10,144
After coming here I have
not seen the full city

1364
01:14:10,201 --> 01:14:11,771
Okay, get in
We'll go that way

1365
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:12,501
Sir!

1366
01:14:12,567 --> 01:14:14,569
We'll send him soon
We'll just take a round and come

1367
01:14:14,667 --> 01:14:16,374
Vasuetta, manage the business

1368
01:14:16,434 --> 01:14:18,607
My father's close friend
Hameedikka is also a policeman

1369
01:14:18,700 --> 01:14:20,611
Sol like policemen a lot

1370
01:14:20,667 --> 01:14:22,078
- What is your name, sir?
- Surendran

1371
01:14:22,134 --> 01:14:23,135
- You
- Shivadasan

1372
01:14:23,201 --> 01:14:24,737
- Sir, your name?
- Kasinadan

1373
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:26,643
Do you take lot of bribe?

1374
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:32,441
Hello, Doctor! We'll meet later on

1375
01:14:32,801 --> 01:14:37,511
Stop here
Where was Padmanabhan taken?

1376
01:14:37,567 --> 01:14:40,207
For what?
Do you want to go there and treat him?

1377
01:14:40,267 --> 01:14:41,610
Then you can go
to police station

1378
01:14:41,700 --> 01:14:44,112
He has gone there to
give statement on bomb case

1379
01:14:44,167 --> 01:14:46,010
Bomb case?
That case is over

1380
01:14:46,100 --> 01:14:47,738
The report of that
had come in the hospital

1381
01:14:47,800 --> 01:14:50,747
In that case there is
something wrong in this

1382
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:54,373
I know this policeman
He is Prakashan sir's man

1383
01:15:03,367 --> 01:15:06,041
- Did you see the complainant?
- Yes

1384
01:15:06,101 --> 01:15:07,409
He wants to take revenge on me

1385
01:15:07,467 --> 01:15:10,641
- Greetings!
- What did the complainant say?

1386
01:15:10,700 --> 01:15:13,738
Day after before
relatives attacked his house

1387
01:15:21,300 --> 01:15:24,144
Tell the rest...he says
they were some 10 to 15 people

1388
01:15:24,267 --> 01:15:29,182
George TV. If it had been fridge?
George Fridge

1389
01:15:30,667 --> 01:15:32,578
- What?
- Is there fridge here?

1390
01:15:32,634 --> 01:15:35,774
Is this your mother-in-laws
house that you are asking about fridge?

1391
01:15:36,634 --> 01:15:40,138
Sorry!
Then?

1392
01:15:40,234 --> 01:15:42,180
They had weapons in their hand

1393
01:15:42,467 --> 01:15:47,075
- They had weapons in their hand
- No need

1394
01:17:02,234 --> 01:17:03,269
- Is that all?
- Yes, sir

1395
01:17:06,700 --> 01:17:09,044
Now he has given the complaint on me

1396
01:17:23,134 --> 01:17:25,171
- ls there nothing in this?
- What is it?

1397
01:17:25,434 --> 01:17:28,244
- Sir, water
- Water?

1398
01:17:28,300 --> 01:17:31,213
- Yes, water
- Do you want me to get it?

1399
01:17:31,300 --> 01:17:33,974
- How dare you?
- Move away

1400
01:17:39,567 --> 01:17:42,070
- What are you doing this?
- That sir sent me reeling

1401
01:17:42,134 --> 01:17:44,205
- Who are you?
- I came here with another sir

1402
01:17:44,267 --> 01:17:46,213
- Which sir?
- With this sir

1403
01:17:46,267 --> 01:17:46,768
I-...?

1404
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:47,774
It is you who brought me here, sir

1405
01:17:48,001 --> 01:17:51,039
- When did I bring you here?
- What are you saying this, sir?

1406
01:17:51,201 --> 01:17:52,612
What is it?

1407
01:17:53,167 --> 01:17:55,169
Sir, he is lying coming to the station

1408
01:17:55,301 --> 01:17:57,076
Is it? Hit him well

1409
01:18:02,167 --> 01:18:03,407
Are you playing with us?

1410
01:18:03,467 --> 01:18:04,605
I'll set you right

1411
01:18:04,700 --> 01:18:06,043
What is it?

1412
01:18:06,500 --> 01:18:08,104
What is the commotion here?

1413
01:18:08,334 --> 01:18:10,780
Who is he? What is the matter?

1414
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,776
Sir, coming here he is
fighting with policemen

1415
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:17,538
Sir, this sir is lying
I'll tell the truth, sir

1416
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:20,638
In the Mayor's old bomb case
they wanted to do some enquiry

1417
01:18:20,700 --> 01:18:22,145
For that this sir
brought me here

1418
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:24,976
Then this sir went inside
I sat inside there

1419
01:18:25,034 --> 01:18:27,036
After that I didn't have to
wait idle even for a minute

1420
01:18:27,100 --> 01:18:29,239
That sir hit me,
another sir hit me

1421
01:18:29,334 --> 01:18:31,007
This sir hit me
The other sir hit me

1422
01:18:31,067 --> 01:18:32,410
Coming from here
another sir hit me

1423
01:18:32,467 --> 01:18:35,311
They hit me from all over
Is this a hitting house?

1424
01:18:35,367 --> 01:18:38,371
What is my fault?
What crime did I do, sir?

1425
01:18:41,067 --> 01:18:43,377
This is the accusation on you

1426
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:46,437
You tried to kill a policeman

1427
01:18:46,501 --> 01:18:47,639
Is that enough?

1428
01:18:50,067 --> 01:18:53,344
Come here
Take him to hospital

1429
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:54,970
Do not worry

1430
01:18:55,067 --> 01:18:58,071
I'll send you money
for expense from office

1431
01:18:58,167 --> 01:19:00,113
Rest of the money
will reach your home

1432
01:19:00,167 --> 01:19:01,373
Okay? Take him

1433
01:19:03,334 --> 01:19:06,281
A cow which crosses the fence
will get destroyed by stick

1434
01:19:06,334 --> 01:19:09,110
Till yesterday the people
who used to fold their hands in...

1435
01:19:09,167 --> 01:19:11,010
...front of me, in front
of them you insulted me

1436
01:19:11,100 --> 01:19:16,482
Those beggars shouted at me
That sound is still ringing in my ears

1437
01:19:16,534 --> 01:19:20,209
lfl must forget that, you must
scream here in pain louder than that

1438
01:19:20,267 --> 01:19:24,443
That sound should
keep ringing in my ears

1439
01:19:26,700 --> 01:19:30,341
Hey, I'm not used to bring
my enemies to station

1440
01:19:30,434 --> 01:19:32,675
I'm the court
I'm the police

1441
01:19:32,734 --> 01:19:37,012
But now the whole city
knows that you are my enemy

1442
01:19:37,067 --> 01:19:40,605
That is why...that is why
you are still alive

1443
01:19:40,667 --> 01:19:45,082
Else your dead body would have got
buried inside the earth long back

1444
01:19:45,167 --> 01:19:50,549
Not a single person who has
snapped his finger against...

1445
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:52,773
...this Pushpam Prakashan
is alive on this earth

1446
01:19:53,001 --> 01:19:55,481
By today your story
will be over

1447
01:19:55,534 --> 01:19:58,105
Sir, his men showed atrocity

1448
01:19:58,167 --> 01:19:59,737
They demolished
an innocent man's house

1449
01:19:59,800 --> 01:20:01,780
That time I interfered
Is that wrong, sir?

1450
01:20:02,001 --> 01:20:02,979
Else what?

1451
01:20:03,034 --> 01:20:05,605
Who gave you license
to take law on hand?

1452
01:20:06,600 --> 01:20:10,343
Okay, are you both a team?

1453
01:20:10,467 --> 01:20:11,673
Yes

1454
01:20:13,234 --> 01:20:17,376
This is an opportunity for you
to show your gratitude to me

1455
01:20:17,500 --> 01:20:19,537
Use it well

1456
01:20:21,634 --> 01:20:30,611
1, 2, s, 4, s, s...

1457
01:20:58,667 --> 01:21:01,705
- Police must showjustice!
- Police must showjustice!

1458
01:21:01,767 --> 01:21:04,179
- Police must showjustice!
- Police must showjustice!

1459
01:21:04,234 --> 01:21:06,578
- Police must showjustice!
- Police must showjustice!

1460
01:21:06,634 --> 01:21:09,342
- Release Padmanabhan!
- Release Padmanabhan!

1461
01:21:09,401 --> 01:21:12,439
- Highness! Move, move away
- Highness, our Padmanabhan

1462
01:21:18,667 --> 01:21:21,409
Highness! Our Padmanabhan...

1463
01:21:22,267 --> 01:21:23,371
Come

1464
01:21:37,300 --> 01:21:40,440
- Isn't Cl there?
- Good morning, Highness!

1465
01:21:40,734 --> 01:21:42,236
- I...
- I know

1466
01:21:42,300 --> 01:21:44,143
Come inside, Highness

1467
01:21:44,234 --> 01:21:47,306
I have come to take Padmanabhan

1468
01:21:49,034 --> 01:21:50,377
Which Padmanabhan?

1469
01:21:50,467 --> 01:21:53,380
From West Fort colony the Padmanabhan
whom you took in custody

1470
01:21:53,434 --> 01:21:57,075
I'll make it clearer
Prakashan, no

1471
01:21:57,134 --> 01:22:01,105
For Prakashan boss the Padmanabhan
whom you took in custody

1472
01:22:02,467 --> 01:22:05,311
How can you talk like this?

1473
01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:09,177
You are insulting a police officer
who is doing his duty sincerely, Highness

1474
01:22:10,267 --> 01:22:13,771
In police language do you call
speaking the truth as insult

1475
01:22:14,300 --> 01:22:15,745
- Mr. Menon!
- Sir!

1476
01:22:15,800 --> 01:22:17,370
He is advocate, KLS Menon

1477
01:22:17,434 --> 01:22:19,107
He is from Supreme colony

1478
01:22:19,201 --> 01:22:20,145
Here

1479
01:22:29,667 --> 01:22:32,978
By coming directly to police station
you are releasing an accused

1480
01:22:33,067 --> 01:22:36,105
From when did Thiruvangoor
kings started doing this?

1481
01:22:36,167 --> 01:22:38,238
This change came from
the time the cap has been...

1482
01:22:38,300 --> 01:22:41,042
...started to be used
with arrogance, circle

1483
01:22:41,134 --> 01:22:45,173
It is Travancore kings who first
formed police academy in Kerala

1484
01:22:45,234 --> 01:22:47,612
To clear rogues
and to protect innocents

1485
01:22:47,667 --> 01:22:50,511
Now the police is clearing
innocents and protecting the rogues

1486
01:22:50,600 --> 01:22:55,015
- What a progress is this?
- I can't release him, Highness

1487
01:22:55,067 --> 01:22:56,705
There is a case that he
attacked a policeman here

1488
01:22:56,767 --> 01:22:57,404
We know

1489
01:22:57,467 --> 01:23:00,107
We also know that policeman was
admitted in Trivandrum medical college

1490
01:23:00,167 --> 01:23:03,046
That is why I had to tell uncle
Highness to interfere in this

1491
01:23:03,101 --> 01:23:06,378
Did you take him into custody
for hitting that policeman?

1492
01:23:06,434 --> 01:23:07,037
No

1493
01:23:07,100 --> 01:23:12,106
When he was taken into custody was
there any case on him in any of the stations?

1494
01:23:13,167 --> 01:23:16,114
What was the reason for which you
arrested him without a warrant?

1495
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:19,010
Can you prove, what was the dire
situation for which you did like that?

1496
01:23:19,067 --> 01:23:20,011
For the sake of the people
who supports you

1497
01:23:20,067 --> 01:23:21,478
For self interest
making false cases

1498
01:23:21,567 --> 01:23:23,774
CRPC 190 and 200

1499
01:23:24,034 --> 01:23:26,742
You will go to jail
for self inflicted injustice

1500
01:23:27,001 --> 01:23:28,378
Not only that, circle

1501
01:23:28,467 --> 01:23:34,418
If a man like Padmanabhan attacks
police station, you must not arrest him

1502
01:23:34,467 --> 01:23:36,777
Instead of that you all
should resign and go out

1503
01:23:37,634 --> 01:23:40,080
ls there a bigger insult than that?

1504
01:23:40,167 --> 01:23:42,306
It is better that
you leave him, Circle

1505
01:23:45,700 --> 01:23:48,704
In Tamil police means protection

1506
01:23:49,001 --> 01:23:51,641
But policeman should
never protect thieves

1507
01:24:14,067 --> 01:24:15,045
Come

1508
01:24:15,167 --> 01:24:19,445
- Highness!
- Come on...let us go

1509
01:24:33,200 --> 01:24:35,237
It is there in my heart

1510
01:25:03,334 --> 01:25:05,507
You have been given
an injection for pain

1511
01:25:05,567 --> 01:25:07,547
Sedation's effect will
remain there for some more time

1512
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:10,274
- Lie down
- I need to go

1513
01:25:10,367 --> 01:25:13,041
To where?
Again in their hands?

1514
01:25:13,100 --> 01:25:16,309
You need one week rest

1515
01:25:16,401 --> 01:25:18,381
Not only rest
but safety also

1516
01:25:18,434 --> 01:25:19,242
Protection

1517
01:25:19,300 --> 01:25:20,301
Let me inside

1518
01:25:20,367 --> 01:25:21,607
I want to see Padmanabhan now

1519
01:25:21,667 --> 01:25:23,044
Where are you going?

1520
01:25:23,100 --> 01:25:25,080
- Get lost
- Can't you hear?

1521
01:25:25,567 --> 01:25:27,274
- You mind your business
- Stop there

1522
01:25:27,334 --> 01:25:29,575
- These royal family people
- Madam, listen to me

1523
01:25:29,634 --> 01:25:30,977
No need to stop her

1524
01:25:31,034 --> 01:25:31,978
- You leave
- God!

1525
01:25:32,034 --> 01:25:34,071
Why have you left him like this?
Why didn't you take him to hospital?

1526
01:25:34,134 --> 01:25:36,307
We have done all
the treatment here itself

1527
01:25:36,367 --> 01:25:37,778
Can't he be saved?

1528
01:25:38,001 --> 01:25:39,537
- God!
- Gosh!

1529
01:25:42,334 --> 01:25:43,540
Not that

1530
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:45,307
We have given
the needed medicines

1531
01:25:45,400 --> 01:25:47,038
There is nothing to worry

1532
01:25:47,801 --> 01:25:50,042
This is Meera
Damodaran sir's...

1533
01:25:50,100 --> 01:25:52,444
I know, I know
You both talk

1534
01:25:53,467 --> 01:25:55,469
Get up
We'll go to our house

1535
01:25:55,567 --> 01:25:59,037
What? For one week padmanabhan
is not going anywhere

1536
01:25:59,101 --> 01:26:01,047
Savitri! Bring milk porridge

1537
01:26:01,667 --> 01:26:03,408
First you must
get back your energy

1538
01:26:03,500 --> 01:26:05,377
You can go Meera
I'm there

1539
01:26:05,434 --> 01:26:06,538
That is what is my fear

1540
01:26:06,601 --> 01:26:07,545
What?

1541
01:26:07,601 --> 01:26:09,171
Nothing!

1542
01:26:11,567 --> 01:26:14,047
Now there is
wound only in body

1543
01:26:14,100 --> 01:26:15,204
That will change
after some time

1544
01:26:15,267 --> 01:26:19,738
But if you do anything against their wish,
they'll cut off your head

1545
01:26:19,801 --> 01:26:22,509
Can't you see sword
and other weapons?

1546
01:26:22,567 --> 01:26:23,545
Enough let us go

1547
01:26:23,601 --> 01:26:25,239
You go now, Meera

1548
01:26:25,300 --> 01:26:27,439
For the time being if I come out,
there will be problem

1549
01:26:27,501 --> 01:26:28,343
That is why

1550
01:26:28,434 --> 01:26:30,436
If she charms you,
my state will be bad

1551
01:26:30,501 --> 01:26:32,344
Not only that
Padmanabhan is my patient

1552
01:26:32,434 --> 01:26:35,074
It is a doctor who takes
decision in patient's issue

1553
01:26:36,367 --> 01:26:38,210
Give a separate room
for Padmanabhan

1554
01:26:38,267 --> 01:26:39,678
The room next to mine

1555
01:26:39,734 --> 01:26:41,714
Police station was
better than this

1556
01:26:41,801 --> 01:26:43,337
- Madam!
- What?

1557
01:26:43,434 --> 01:26:46,142
Her Highness, come this side

1558
01:26:51,767 --> 01:26:55,738
This Padmanabhan
is a big rowdy

1559
01:26:56,301 --> 01:26:59,145
A girl told Padmanabha
I love you

1560
01:26:59,200 --> 01:27:02,613
Then Padmanabhan hit that girl

1561
01:27:02,667 --> 01:27:04,044
- Is it?
- Yes

1562
01:27:04,100 --> 01:27:06,239
- When was that?
- I'm happy

1563
01:27:06,301 --> 01:27:10,078
It is my wish that
I should get slapped by a good man

1564
01:27:19,167 --> 01:27:20,475
She is innocent

1565
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:24,638
if they were ruling,
what would have been the state?

1566
01:27:25,067 --> 01:27:28,640
Goddess, these women are
called as princess...princess!

1567
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:38,137
I should deal this
in some other manner

1568
01:27:38,200 --> 01:27:39,042
Hi, Meera!

1569
01:27:39,100 --> 01:27:40,579
- The next one
- How is Padmanabhan?

1570
01:27:40,634 --> 01:27:43,240
Padmanabhan?
He is fully well

1571
01:27:43,300 --> 01:27:44,244
He is there in Vaikundam

1572
01:27:44,301 --> 01:27:45,575
Resting there leisurely

1573
01:27:45,634 --> 01:27:48,581
His head is on Lakshmi Devi's lap
and feet on Bhoomi Devi's lap

1574
01:27:48,634 --> 01:27:50,705
He is lying there happily
rotating the Sudarshana Chakra

1575
01:27:50,767 --> 01:27:53,441
- Do you want to see?
- Has this girl gone mad? Come

1576
01:27:53,534 --> 01:27:54,774
You have gone mad

1577
01:27:55,734 --> 01:27:58,510
God! Will I lose Padmanabhan?

1578
01:27:58,601 --> 01:28:01,241
Where? Where are you going?
You are a real nuisance

1579
01:28:01,334 --> 01:28:03,371
Don't make me lose my job
Go away

1580
01:28:04,500 --> 01:28:07,310
All have decided not to
give me peace of mind

1581
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:11,504
On head side there is princess
and on feet side there is journalist

1582
01:28:15,100 --> 01:28:18,206
I'll go from here only
by taking Padmanabhan with me

1583
01:28:19,567 --> 01:28:24,567

Why did you bring the car
to the car shed, boss?

1633
01:32:38,434 --> 01:32:42,109
This is not car shed, Mayor
It is car lift

1634
01:32:48,767 --> 01:32:50,678
Are you taking me
to kill, boss?

1635
01:32:50,734 --> 01:32:55,683
Don't be tensed, Mayor sir
We are going to boss private suit

1636
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:08,005
Com e, come
Look here

01:33:12,567 --> 01:33:15,013
Welcome to Pushpam Prakashan

1639
01:33:15,100 --> 01:33:18,547
This is excellent
Let me try!

1640
01:33:21,700 --> 01:33:23,338
Open, Seese

Access denied
Access denied

1642
01:33:27,134 --> 01:33:30,343
Foolish Mayor
That is finger sensor

1643
01:33:30,400 --> 01:33:34,280
Only with my finger
you can close and open that door

1644
01:33:34,334 --> 01:33:37,213
But boss, when we come in lift
if the current supply goes...

1645
01:33:37,267 --> 01:33:39,770
...won't we die with
suffocation inside the car?

1646
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:41,377
Nothing will happen

1647
01:33:41,434 --> 01:33:44,381
I have installed
Japan solar system

1648
01:33:44,434 --> 01:33:46,175
Even if there is electricity failure...

1649
01:33:46,234 --> 01:33:47,542
...there will be current supply for

1650
01:33:47,601 --> 01:33:50,241
two hours inside this room and lift

1651
01:33:50,300 --> 01:33:52,007
Look here, Mayor

1652
01:33:55,734 --> 01:33:57,077
How is it?

1653
01:33:58,134 --> 01:34:01,445
From here I can see
the whole city

1654
01:34:01,500 --> 01:34:02,638
That Padmanabhan...

1655
01:34:02,701 --> 01:34:05,682
...and that Padmanabha swami
temple is much lower to me

1656
01:34:05,734 --> 01:34:07,771
On 14th floor helicopter
can be landed

1657
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,708
I can fly and come here
from anywhere and go anywhere

1658
01:34:10,767 --> 01:34:11,677
Yes

1659
01:34:12,567 --> 01:34:13,671
Best set up

1660
01:34:13,734 --> 01:34:16,578
Within 4 months the finishing
set up will be over

1661
01:34:16,634 --> 01:34:18,443
Once that is over,
the inauguration

1662
01:34:18,534 --> 01:34:20,309
Do you know who is
going to inaugurate?

1663
01:34:20,367 --> 01:34:20,606
No

1664
01:34:20,667 --> 01:34:23,045
World actress
Ais hwarya Rai

1665
01:34:23,634 --> 01:34:24,635
Gosh!

1666
01:34:33,734 --> 01:34:36,772
Have you all come to enquire
about Padmanabhan's health?

1667
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,378
Now he needs full rest

1668
01:34:39,467 --> 01:34:42,414
Uncle has come here
with a demand also

1669
01:34:42,500 --> 01:34:43,501
What is that?

1670
01:34:43,567 --> 01:34:46,605
In the coming corporation election
against Purushottaman...

1671
01:34:46,667 --> 01:34:49,079
...Padmanabhan must contest
from our ward

1672
01:34:49,167 --> 01:34:52,341
They can't bear to see me
left over with little bit life

1673
01:34:52,401 --> 01:34:54,506
I'm not able to stand on earth
with both my legs

1674
01:34:54,567 --> 01:34:55,671
In that they are talking
about contesting election

1675
01:34:55,734 --> 01:34:58,681
You must agree to contest
Without that we won't retreat

1676
01:34:58,734 --> 01:34:59,712
Yes, yes

1677
01:34:59,800 --> 01:35:01,643
There is nothing wrong
in what they are saying

1678
01:35:01,700 --> 01:35:04,237
To represent a crowd
one leader is a must

1679
01:35:04,300 --> 01:35:07,042
Their wish, expectation,
opposition must be fulfilled...

1680
01:35:07,100 --> 01:35:09,478
...by a leader standing in front

1681
01:35:09,600 --> 01:35:13,013
Your Highness is on
my side or their side?

1682
01:35:13,067 --> 01:35:15,047
I'm on the side of truth, Padamanabha!

1683
01:35:15,667 --> 01:35:21,310
They don't wish you to become a president
chief minister or minister

1684
01:35:21,534 --> 01:35:25,107
In a small ward of here
a small councillor

1685
01:35:25,367 --> 01:35:30,248
They are fed up of Purushu
Now they need a true leader...

1686
01:35:30,300 --> 01:35:33,213
...who has principles, courage
and mercy for fellow people

1687
01:35:33,300 --> 01:35:36,372
Your Highness! I'm not
that much of a principled man

1688
01:35:36,500 --> 01:35:37,979
Then courage

1689
01:35:38,267 --> 01:35:41,612
it was an act that I showed
when I found people with me

1690
01:35:41,667 --> 01:35:44,978
I don't know whether I'm a man
with mercy for fellow people

1691
01:35:45,067 --> 01:35:50,016
You saying this openly shows
that you have all this inside you

1692
01:35:50,067 --> 01:35:51,705
- But I...
- You need not say anything

1693
01:35:51,800 --> 01:35:54,713
Kings don't have
the habit of requesting

1694
01:35:54,767 --> 01:35:57,270
They are accustomed to
give order and permission

1695
01:35:57,334 --> 01:35:59,541
Take this as an order
of that type

1696
01:35:59,634 --> 01:36:04,447
In the coming corporation election
from your ward Padmanabhan will contest

1697
01:36:04,501 --> 01:36:06,105
My God!

1698

Bash him up

1718
01:38:51,167 --> 01:38:53,704
What did you get for
betraying your friend?

1719
01:38:53,800 --> 01:38:56,280
Did you come from Palakadu
till here for this?

1720
01:38:56,367 --> 01:38:57,471
Gosh!

1721
01:38:57,567 --> 01:39:01,276
Let me say something
Will you betray our Padmanabhan?

1722
01:39:02,300 --> 01:39:05,543
- All me to say something
- You don't say anything

1723
01:39:15,200 --> 01:39:17,510
Sir! Sir, see this

1724
01:39:18,534 --> 01:39:20,070
Rascal...!

1725
01:39:21,434 --> 01:39:24,210
Move, move on
Get inside the jeep

1726
01:39:24,267 --> 01:39:26,747
Your leader made you
hit him like this

1727
01:39:27,801 --> 01:39:30,145
At this very moment
I'll lift him

1728
01:39:34,034 --> 01:39:35,604
Try to lift me

1729
01:39:47,434 --> 01:39:49,004
Are you a weight lifter?

1730
01:39:49,067 --> 01:39:50,307
Will you lift anyone you see?

1731
01:39:50,367 --> 01:39:54,008
Yes, I came to lift you
You have still not learnt?

1732
01:39:54,100 --> 01:39:55,135
I have learnt

1733
01:39:55,201 --> 01:39:56,737
When we read a lot
and become smart...

1734
01:39:56,800 --> 01:39:59,212
...we'll feel like teaching
someone else what we learnt

1735
01:39:59,267 --> 01:40:00,268
When I thought like that...

1736
01:40:00,334 --> 01:40:03,144
...I felt it is better to teach
the guy itself who taught me

1737
01:40:03,200 --> 01:40:05,305
Then you try to teach me

1738
01:40:24,567 --> 01:40:26,274
I removed the air, sir

1739
01:40:26,334 --> 01:40:28,405
Else you might escape
in the jeep

1740
01:40:28,501 --> 01:40:29,275
You...!

1741
01:40:30,800 --> 01:40:32,006
You! Rascal!

1742
01:40:32,100 --> 01:40:34,137
- Leave me, sir
- Where you cheating me?

1743
01:40:34,200 --> 01:40:37,477
Then what did you think?
Do you think you can buy them?

1744
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:42,574
To betray the person with you
is the job of thieves like you

1745
01:40:42,634 --> 01:40:44,705
You fraud police!

1746
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:48,140
This was drama
Complete drama

1747
01:40:50,134 --> 01:40:53,377
Haven't you heard about getting
the same snake which bit to take the poison?

1748
01:40:53,434 --> 01:40:54,742
We called you for that

1749
01:40:56,267 --> 01:41:00,215
Hey! if all of us hit,
the snake will die

1750
01:41:00,267 --> 01:41:01,371
Isn't it, sir?

1751
01:41:01,434 --> 01:41:03,004
Then are you going to hit me?

1752
01:41:03,067 --> 01:41:05,673
Then you try to hit me
Hit me...hit me

1753
01:41:06,734 --> 01:41:08,077
I'll hit you

1754
01:41:08,234 --> 01:41:09,679
But this cap

1755
01:41:10,434 --> 01:41:14,041
This police crown has been
a decoration for many great people

1756
01:41:14,134 --> 01:41:16,273
But now it is in
the head of an arrogant man

1757
01:41:16,368 --> 01:41:18,678
Even then I have
lot of respect for it

1758
01:41:20,234 --> 01:41:21,406
Then you come

1759
01:41:21,500 --> 01:41:23,241
You must remove
the shin too

1760
01:41:23,300 --> 01:41:25,746
I don't want this Khaki
to come under my shoe

1761
01:41:25,800 --> 01:41:27,438
I'll get curse

1762
01:41:37,134 --> 01:41:40,513
To get rid of a puny like you,
I don't need the help of uniform

1763
01:41:40,567 --> 01:41:43,070
Don't remove the pant
Did you adjust the belt?

1764
01:41:43,134 --> 01:41:44,408
What a muscle?

1765
01:41:44,467 --> 01:41:46,572
I feel like piercing
rod and rotating

1766
01:41:50,600 --> 01:41:51,544
Come on

1767
01:41:51,601 --> 01:41:53,239
Don't be in a hurry

1768
01:41:53,301 --> 01:41:55,679
Till yesterday I had to
follow the rules of election

1769
01:41:55,734 --> 01:41:57,714
Tomorrow the election
result will be coming

1770
01:41:57,800 --> 01:41:59,780
Either I'll lose or win

1771
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:01,775
lfl lose, how can I
walk with my head held high?

1772
01:42:02,001 --> 01:42:03,173
On the other hand if I win...

1773
01:42:03,234 --> 01:42:05,510
...it is bad to take revenge
on those who lose

1774
01:42:05,600 --> 01:42:11,016
That is why we selected today
which is between yesterday and tomorrow

1775
01:42:12,201 --> 01:42:14,613
Shall we start then?
Wish me

1776
01:42:14,701 --> 01:42:16,612
- All the best
- Prakasha!

1777
01:42:16,667 --> 01:42:17,543
- All the best
- Win and come

1778
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:19,477
- All the best
- All the best

1779
01:42:22,534 --> 01:42:24,741
What punch is this?
Didn't you pray for me?

1780
01:42:24,800 --> 01:42:25,778
Of course

1781
01:45:41,567 --> 01:45:43,069
Mother!

1782
01:45:44,134 --> 01:45:47,172
Do we need to continue more?
Then okay

1783
01:45:48,434 --> 01:45:51,972
On the basis of muscle power
you have hit me

1784
01:45:52,234 --> 01:45:58,150
Butjustice is on my side
The power of that is very great

1785
01:45:59,501 --> 01:46:01,208
ls there any more
problem between us?

1786
01:46:01,267 --> 01:46:02,211
- Ole

1787
01:46:02,300 --> 01:46:04,246
Don't create any
I can't take it

1788
01:46:05,034 --> 01:46:09,608
The corporation election
results are coming out

1789
01:46:09,667 --> 01:46:13,012
The Thiruvananthapuram
corporation election result is out

1790
01:46:13,100 --> 01:46:16,445
From fourth ward the ruling party
representative Mayor Purushothaman...

1791
01:46:16,500 --> 01:46:18,776
...and opposition leader Charles
is being overtaken

1792
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:20,980
...by independent
contestant Padmanabhan

1793
01:46:21,034 --> 01:46:24,777
It is announced that he has won
the election with tremendous majority

1794
01:46:25,034 --> 01:46:27,310
Going to the other news
Kerala is...

1795
01:46:27,634 --> 01:46:29,705
- What happened?
- What happened?

1796
01:46:32,634 --> 01:46:35,547
Ananthapuram corporation
will have hung counsel

1797
01:46:35,600 --> 01:46:37,671
SPP is in the lead
with 50 seats

1798
01:46:37,734 --> 01:46:39,975
KPC league will
have equal votes

1799
01:46:40,034 --> 01:46:41,342
Both parties have equal votes

1800
01:46:41,401 --> 01:46:44,007
The stand of the independent
candidate from fourth ward

1801
01:46:44,067 --> 01:46:46,445
There is chance of candidates
shifting their alliance

1802
01:46:46,501 --> 01:46:49,448
The situation for the final
decision has come

1803
01:46:49,501 --> 01:46:51,139
In both the party offices...

1804
01:46:51,201 --> 01:46:54,205
Political manipulation
is going on strongly

1805
01:47:00,800 --> 01:47:04,475
It is a corporation
which we were ruling from 25 years

1806
01:47:04,567 --> 01:47:06,604
Now it might slip
from our hands

1807
01:47:06,700 --> 01:47:08,509
Party is worried
about only itself

1808
01:47:08,567 --> 01:47:10,672
None of you are bothered
about me losing position

1809
01:47:10,734 --> 01:47:11,439
I'll die

1810
01:47:11,500 --> 01:47:12,740
Mother's promise,
I'll die

1811
01:47:12,800 --> 01:47:14,404
I'll die
Mother's promise

1812
01:47:14,467 --> 01:47:15,207
I'll die

1813
01:47:15,267 --> 01:47:16,746
Go and die
Die fast

1814
01:47:17,500 --> 01:47:20,640
KRP, from how long
you are consuming alcohol?

1815
01:47:20,734 --> 01:47:22,577
Take a decision soon

1816
01:47:24,534 --> 01:47:28,277
Can we stabilize this rule,
if we get one more councillor?

1817
01:47:28,334 --> 01:47:29,335
We can stabilize

1818
01:47:29,400 --> 01:47:31,505
But how will you
get a councillor?

1819
01:47:31,600 --> 01:47:33,011
We can give money
and buy

1820
01:47:33,067 --> 01:47:35,308
From opposition
we'll buy a councillor

1821
01:47:35,367 --> 01:47:37,142
I'll give the money for that

1822
01:47:37,201 --> 01:47:39,010
Boss, say something
which is possible

1823
01:47:39,100 --> 01:47:40,670
This time the opposition
is vigilant

1824
01:47:40,734 --> 01:47:42,509
What Saghadevan says is correct

1825
01:47:42,600 --> 01:47:44,671
They'll try to buy
one from our side

1826
01:47:44,734 --> 01:47:46,509
Meeting is going on there

1827
01:47:46,567 --> 01:47:49,343
They are doing plans
to take over corporation

1828
01:47:56,667 --> 01:47:58,237
KRP, it is me

1829
01:47:58,300 --> 01:48:00,337
From Thiruvangoor palace,
Udaya Verma

1830
01:48:00,434 --> 01:48:01,435
Highness!

1831
01:48:01,534 --> 01:48:06,506
I knowyou'll be busy in the meeting
to stabilize corporation rule

1832
01:48:06,701 --> 01:48:09,045
I'll put forward an idea

1833
01:48:09,134 --> 01:48:12,411
You put the phone in speaker,
so that everyone can hear

1834
01:48:13,734 --> 01:48:17,511
If you are ready to take
Padmanabhan who won...

1835
01:48:17,600 --> 01:48:22,413
...independently from fourth ward,
Padmanabhan will support your party

1836
01:48:23,301 --> 01:48:25,110
Did you understand
what I said?

1837
01:48:25,168 --> 01:48:29,639
If you make Padmanabhan as Mayor,
you can stabilize the rule

1838
01:48:32,334 --> 01:48:34,314
Whatever it may be,
give your answer soon

1839
01:48:34,367 --> 01:48:37,075
After knowing that we'll call
the opposition leader

1840
01:48:40,434 --> 01:48:42,505
There is nothing to think KRP

1841
01:48:42,567 --> 01:48:45,343
Let us make him Mayor
and stabilize the rule

1842
01:48:45,400 --> 01:48:47,311
What? What? What?

1843
01:48:47,400 --> 01:48:49,778
Rather than to make
that Padmanabhan Mayor...

1844
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:52,310
...we can shave our head,
put marks on face...

1845
01:48:52,367 --> 01:48:55,644
...shave one side mustache and roam
around the city sitting on a donkey

1846
01:48:55,701 --> 01:48:56,304
Boss, I'll die

1847
01:48:56,367 --> 01:48:58,643
No one is right
He is your enemy

1848
01:48:58,701 --> 01:49:00,078
My enemy?

1849
01:49:00,134 --> 01:49:03,013
If he is my enemy,
then he is an enemy to the party too

1850
01:49:03,067 --> 01:49:05,707
Do you know how much I
have spent for this party?

1851
01:49:06,001 --> 01:49:08,607
Prakashan boss,
what you are saying is true

1852
01:49:08,667 --> 01:49:12,080
But this is a life
and death fight for the party

1853
01:49:12,167 --> 01:49:14,511
When we think in the policies
of national politics

1854
01:49:14,567 --> 01:49:16,706
...this tactical move
is necessary for the party

1855
01:49:16,767 --> 01:49:17,677
Stop it"!

1856
01:49:17,734 --> 01:49:20,977
Is there a single person here
who has not take money from me?

1857
01:49:21,034 --> 01:49:22,138
Didn't you take?

1858
01:49:22,234 --> 01:49:23,338
Didn't you take and eat?

1859
01:49:23,400 --> 01:49:26,472
Boss, it is daughter's marriage,
I need 10 lakhs

1860
01:49:26,534 --> 01:49:28,980
There is father's death anniversary
Afunction is necessary

1861
01:49:29,034 --> 01:49:31,036
You all took money
and enjoyed

1862
01:49:31,101 --> 01:49:32,978
Now I'm no one
to you all, isn't it?

1863
01:49:33,034 --> 01:49:34,638
Boss, let both of us die

1864
01:49:34,701 --> 01:49:36,009
Get lost

1865
01:49:36,067 --> 01:49:37,705
Prakashan boss,
have patience

1866
01:49:37,767 --> 01:49:40,270
Even if he becomes a Mayor,
rule is in our hand

1867
01:49:40,334 --> 01:49:43,781
Is it good for us whether opposition party
rules or our party rules?

1868
01:49:44,001 --> 01:49:48,177
For the time being it is good for us
and party to accept us

1869
01:49:50,401 --> 01:49:52,108
- Boss!
- Boss!

1870
01:49:57,267 --> 01:49:59,338
What happened
to your decision, KRP?

1871
01:49:59,401 --> 01:50:01,745
We accept your instructions

1872
01:50:01,800 --> 01:50:02,972
Thank you!

1873
01:50:04,134 --> 01:50:08,640
From Palakadu a wanderer boy came
to conduct procession for money

1874
01:50:08,701 --> 01:50:10,510
Now he is becoming
the King of this state

1875
01:50:10,600 --> 01:50:11,578
Wanderer king

1876
01:50:11,634 --> 01:50:20,452
"King...King...Wanderer King
King...King...Wanderer King"

1877
01:50:21,667 --> 01:50:24,147
I, Padmanabhan son of
Vadakkemadathu Madhavan...

1878
01:50:24,201 --> 01:50:29,207
...who has been elected as
the Mayor of Thiruvananthapuram corporation

1879
01:50:29,333 --> 01:50:32,507
I, Padmanabhan son of
Vadakkemadathu Madhavan...

1880
01:50:32,601 --> 01:50:36,378
...who has been elected as
the Mayor of Thiruvananthapuram corporation

1881
01:50:36,434 --> 01:50:39,643
...do solemnly promise
in the name of God

1882
01:50:39,700 --> 01:50:43,204
...that I'll uphold the dignity
of the Indian constitution

1883
01:50:43,267 --> 01:50:48,615
...and act truthfully and trustworthily,
without any bias or partiality or prejudice

1884
01:50:48,700 --> 01:50:53,740
...and discharge my official duties
to the best of my ability

1885
01:50:54,001 --> 01:50:57,608
...and knowledge without
fear or favour

1886
01:51:27,100 --> 01:51:30,479
When they come to high positions
they are bound to forget the past

1887
01:51:30,534 --> 01:51:32,309
It is enough to have
yes men around him

1888
01:51:32,401 --> 01:51:35,348
Now what happened, Subhair?
Padmanabhan became a Mayor

1889
01:51:35,401 --> 01:51:36,277
Yes

1890
01:51:36,334 --> 01:51:40,476
After this we must clean up
this whole Thiruvananthapuram

1891
01:51:49,200 --> 01:51:52,704
This is the first application that
I'm accepting after becoming a Mayor

1892
01:51:52,801 --> 01:51:54,246
Why are you crying
and giving that?

1893
01:51:54,300 --> 01:51:57,440
Even if it is late,
I'll be getting justice

1894
01:51:57,501 --> 01:51:59,242
This is the happiness of that

1895
01:51:59,301 --> 01:52:00,746
These are tears of that

1896
01:52:02,134 --> 01:52:05,377
By finding a solution
to my problem, Padmanabhan...

1897
01:52:05,434 --> 01:52:08,210
...no Mayor wants to
start his official duty

1898
01:52:09,001 --> 01:52:11,208
There is a bit of
selfishness also in that

1899
01:52:11,301 --> 01:52:13,645
From the time this house
was about to get demolished...

1900
01:52:13,701 --> 01:52:15,647
...my life started to change

1901
01:52:15,734 --> 01:52:18,305
I have a indebtness
towards this house

1902
01:52:31,768 --> 01:52:33,304
Greetings!

1903
01:52:34,201 --> 01:52:38,172
Expecting your help
and co-operation from today...

1904
01:52:38,501 --> 01:52:42,244
...as Mayor I'm going
to start my work

1905
01:52:45,401 --> 01:52:48,507
Sit, sit
This is Manu

1906
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:52,413
In his leadership
I have employed...

1907
01:52:52,534 --> 01:52:55,037
...as my personal staff
a team of ten computer experts

1908
01:52:55,134 --> 01:52:57,444
You all must
co ordinate with them

1909
01:53:00,434 --> 01:53:02,641
Who is the building permit
section superintendent?

1910
01:53:02,700 --> 01:53:03,735
It is me, sir

1911
01:53:03,800 --> 01:53:07,373
I want all the files of
building permits...

1912
01:53:07,467 --> 01:53:10,004
...sanctions of last 30 years
in my desk before today 5 PM

1913
01:53:10,067 --> 01:53:14,072
Sir, how can I get so many years
files before 5 o'clock?

1914
01:53:14,134 --> 01:53:16,045
Why? Is that not possible, madam?

1915
01:53:16,101 --> 01:53:17,307
It is difficult, sir

1916
01:53:17,567 --> 01:53:19,672
Didn't you hear secretary sir
what Mayor sir said?

1917
01:53:19,767 --> 01:53:21,644
You tell him and make him
understand, sir

1918
01:53:21,701 --> 01:53:23,544
- What is your name, sir?
- Varijakshan

1919
01:53:23,600 --> 01:53:27,207
I'm Municipal office union's
committee president also

1920
01:53:27,800 --> 01:53:31,111
That is why Varijakshan
has an extra bone

1921
01:53:31,334 --> 01:53:34,577
Then shouldn't you tell earlier itself
that you are the president?

1922
01:53:35,267 --> 01:53:41,081
Secretary sir, give this Varijakshan sir
suspension letter as token

1923
01:53:41,201 --> 01:53:42,305
- That
- Sir, that

1924
01:53:42,367 --> 01:53:43,971
Do you have stomach problem?

1925
01:53:44,034 --> 01:53:44,444
No

1926
01:53:44,500 --> 01:53:46,537
- Your expression has changed
- No problem

1927
01:53:46,600 --> 01:53:48,136
Then you give him
suspension letter

1928
01:53:48,200 --> 01:53:50,373
You can't suspend him
just like that, sir

1929
01:53:50,467 --> 01:53:52,174
We have seen lot of Mayors

1930
01:53:52,234 --> 01:53:54,976
They have all had
good relationship with officers

1931
01:53:55,034 --> 01:53:56,035
So that is it

1932
01:53:56,234 --> 01:53:59,408
Should I be like the other Mayors
whom you have seen?

1933
01:53:59,467 --> 01:54:00,502
Hello! Yes, sir
I'll give it to him

1934
01:54:00,567 --> 01:54:03,446
ls there any problem
if I think slightly differently?

1935
01:54:03,534 --> 01:54:05,013
It is the minister, sir

1936
01:54:06,301 --> 01:54:08,144
- Who?
- Minister

1937
01:54:12,367 --> 01:54:15,280
Hello, sir!
It is me Padmanabhan

1938
01:54:15,367 --> 01:54:16,573
Sir, one minute

1939
01:54:16,634 --> 01:54:18,477
I'll put this phone
in speaker mode

1940
01:54:18,534 --> 01:54:20,775
Okay! Isn't this the one?

1941
01:54:21,001 --> 01:54:21,979
Yes

1942
01:54:22,034 --> 01:54:23,604
Hello! Tell me, sir

1943
01:54:23,667 --> 01:54:25,305
- Did you suspend Varijakshan?
- Yes, sir

1944
01:54:25,367 --> 01:54:26,573
- I suspended him
- What?

1945
01:54:26,634 --> 01:54:29,012
Not one, but two people

1946
01:54:29,401 --> 01:54:31,608
- What is your name?
- Uruvila Joseph

1947
01:54:31,668 --> 01:54:34,205
Uruvila Joseph

1948
01:54:34,367 --> 01:54:37,246
Sir, I'm suspending
one Variyal and Vila

1949
01:54:38,401 --> 01:54:41,473
Within half an hour I'll tell you
who all will leave behind them, sir

1950
01:54:41,534 --> 01:54:43,104
What is your idea?

1951
01:54:43,167 --> 01:54:45,443
The majority of the staff
is from my party union

1952
01:54:45,534 --> 01:54:46,979
There will be problem, Mayor

1953
01:54:47,034 --> 01:54:48,980
I'm telling this for you
and the staff here...

1954
01:54:49,034 --> 01:54:50,638
...who are from your union

1955
01:54:51,067 --> 01:54:55,379
If even a single person
shouts a slogan against me...

1956
01:54:56,267 --> 01:54:58,474
...that very minute
I'll shift side

1957
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:01,002
I'll support
the opposition party

1958
01:55:05,167 --> 01:55:07,511
From last 20 years
the corporate rule...

1959
01:55:07,567 --> 01:55:11,310
...which you have in your custody
will go to the opposition

1960
01:55:11,534 --> 01:55:13,707
That time also
I'll remain as Mayor

1961
01:55:14,100 --> 01:55:17,047
I'll examine all
the files thoroughly

1962
01:55:17,201 --> 01:55:19,579
I may have to examine you also

1963
01:55:19,634 --> 01:55:20,612
Should I do that?

1964
01:55:20,701 --> 01:55:24,171
On the contrary,
if you cooperate with me now...

1965
01:55:24,534 --> 01:55:27,606
...You won't have to give up rule
and you can retain your image

1966
01:55:27,667 --> 01:55:29,010
What do you say, sir?

1967
01:55:30,667 --> 01:55:32,408
Shall I suspend them?

1968
01:55:32,501 --> 01:55:35,573
If that is justice,
you do that

1969
01:55:39,434 --> 01:55:41,710
Did you hear?
Minister gave up

1970
01:55:43,100 --> 01:55:45,171
The usages of leg

1971
01:55:45,401 --> 01:55:47,244
It is not for walking alone

1972
01:55:47,334 --> 01:55:49,678
It can be used
also to shift side

1973
01:55:49,800 --> 01:55:53,373
God has given leg to
these people for that also

1974
01:55:53,434 --> 01:55:55,243
- Secretary!
- Sir!

1975
01:55:57,334 --> 01:56:02,408
Instead of trusting people like him
and making a living by running union...

1976
01:56:02,467 --> 01:56:05,175
...it is better to work hard

1977
01:56:05,534 --> 01:56:07,172
Varijakshan

1978
01:56:07,501 --> 01:56:08,673
Uruvila

1979
01:56:23,134 --> 01:56:25,171
I'm the father of this city

1980
01:56:25,234 --> 01:56:27,236
If children make mistake,
for the first time...

1981
01:56:27,301 --> 01:56:29,076
...father will forgive them

1982
01:56:29,267 --> 01:56:32,009
- Mayor Padmanabhan!
- Praise!

1983
01:56:32,634 --> 01:56:36,480
Then 30 years file
before 5 o'clock

1984
01:56:36,534 --> 01:56:37,672
No need for 5 o'clock

1985
01:56:37,734 --> 01:56:39,304
We'll bring it
by 3 o'clock, sir

1986
01:56:39,367 --> 01:56:41,369
Will you make this too much?

1987
01:56:44,434 --> 01:56:48,507
"Come, come, come
Come as a change of sea"

1988
01:56:48,601 --> 01:56:53,050

1989

This country must become of gold"

1990

1992
01:57:10,634 --> 01:57:14,707
"Come, come, come
Come as a change of sea"

1993
01:57:15,068 --> 01:57:19,346
"Come, come, come
Come as a progressive army"

1994
01:57:19,734 --> 01:57:24,734
<i>tiff </i>

1995
01:57:55,734 --> 01:58:01,343
"You are the face of straight forwardness
The face of revolution"

1996
01:58:01,401 --> 01:58:04,712
"Can't you see
the heart of this city?"

1997
01:58:04,801 --> 01:58:12,982
"Can you hear
the music of pleasure?"

1998
01:58:13,434 --> 01:58:17,678
"Sadness has vanished"

1999
01:58:17,767 --> 01:58:22,273
"The city has changed
into a dream city"

2000
01:58:22,367 --> 01:58:30,684
"There are buildings all over
We have forgotten our duties"

2001
01:58:30,734 --> 01:58:35,183

Make the city progress, progress"

2004
01:58:51,034 --> 01:58:52,138
Subhair, stop

2005
01:58:56,367 --> 01:58:59,211
What nonsense are you doing?

2006
01:58:59,300 --> 01:59:00,040
La...la...la...la

2007
01:59:00,100 --> 01:59:02,341
Child! Child, I'm telling you

2008
01:59:03,600 --> 01:59:04,544
What?

2009
01:59:04,601 --> 01:59:05,511
Are you not a child?

2010
01:59:05,568 --> 01:59:07,605
Yes, I'm a Kutty
Krishnankutty

2011
01:59:07,667 --> 01:59:09,203
You need not look like that

2012
01:59:09,267 --> 01:59:10,974
I'm the father of two children

2013
01:59:11,034 --> 01:59:13,480
Don't you know that you should not
disturb a person while he is urinating?

2014
01:59:13,534 --> 01:59:15,013
I lost my flow

2015
01:59:15,067 --> 01:59:17,069
Is it Mullai Periyar dam
to maintain flow?

2016
01:59:17,167 --> 01:59:17,645
Let it be

2017
01:59:17,700 --> 01:59:19,236
It is Nigeria falls

2018
01:59:19,300 --> 01:59:22,474
Don't you know that
you should not urinate on road?

2019
01:59:23,001 --> 01:59:26,244
It is people like you
who spoil the name of Malayalees

2020
01:59:26,301 --> 01:59:28,542
If a board is kept not to spit,
they spit there

2021
01:59:28,601 --> 01:59:29,671
If we tell not to throw
garbage in a place...

2022
01:59:29,734 --> 01:59:31,077
...they'll throw garbage there

2023
01:59:31,134 --> 01:59:32,977
If it is said not to urinate,
they'll urinate there

2024
01:59:33,034 --> 01:59:33,978
What?

2025
01:59:34,034 --> 01:59:35,035
If you have guts,
you urinate one more time

2026
01:59:35,100 --> 01:59:36,010
Do it

2027
01:59:36,101 --> 01:59:37,580
If you repeat this,
whole your life...

2028
01:59:37,634 --> 01:59:39,204
...you'll have to urinate
through tube

2029
01:59:39,267 --> 01:59:40,405
I'll cut that off

2030
01:59:40,467 --> 01:59:42,743
- Oh! 22FK
- No, sir

2031
01:59:42,800 --> 01:59:44,711
In that movie there is
a cutting like that

2032
01:59:44,767 --> 01:59:46,713
When I'm talking seriously,
are you telling movie name?

2033
01:59:46,767 --> 01:59:48,178
He is the Mayor

2034
01:59:48,267 --> 01:59:50,110
- Mayor?
- Yes

2035
01:59:50,167 --> 01:59:51,339
Father of the city

2036
01:59:51,734 --> 01:59:53,111
All that is okay

2037
01:59:53,167 --> 01:59:56,410
For the common man to urinate,
you show me toilet

2038
01:59:56,467 --> 01:59:57,537
I'll go there

2039
01:59:58,367 --> 02:00:00,074
Subhair, you take him
to Vallaiambalam

2040
02:00:00,134 --> 02:00:01,135
There is no toilet there

2041
02:00:01,200 --> 02:00:02,440
- In statue?
- There also no

2042
02:00:02,500 --> 02:00:03,604
- Palayam?
- No

2043
02:00:03,667 --> 02:00:04,645
Kumaraburam, Shasthapuram

2044
02:00:04,701 --> 02:00:06,738
Sir! The only one
is in bus stand

2045
02:00:06,800 --> 02:00:11,681
If a guy goes there once,
then in his whole life he won't urinate

2046
02:00:15,501 --> 02:00:17,412
He'll put a cork

2047
02:00:17,534 --> 02:00:19,536
This is good
25 toilets

2048
02:00:19,600 --> 02:00:22,137
10 rest room
4 parks

2049
02:00:23,034 --> 02:00:25,139
Totally 8 crore rupees

2050
02:00:25,234 --> 02:00:28,215
Should I, the Finance
minister allot this?

2051
02:00:28,267 --> 02:00:31,737
From next month MLA'S salary
is being given a raise by 30%

2052
02:00:31,800 --> 02:00:35,111
This was passed
by all party members

2053
02:00:35,200 --> 02:00:36,702
For that I have to make
a provision of crores

2054
02:00:36,767 --> 02:00:40,214
In the middle of that
you have brought this toilet matter

2055
02:00:40,601 --> 02:00:43,707
None of your tricks
will work anymore

2056
02:00:43,800 --> 02:00:46,713
I'll get the fund
for my corporation

2057
02:00:47,001 --> 02:00:49,379
You are not the only
Mayor of this country

2058
02:00:49,434 --> 02:00:51,778
Athing that could not be
set right in 60 years...

2059
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:53,741
...are you trying to set
right in 60 days?

2060
02:00:53,801 --> 02:00:57,305
If we sincerely want to correct it,
60 days are not needed

2061
02:00:57,400 --> 02:00:59,209
60 minute is enough, sir

2062
02:00:59,267 --> 02:01:02,737
For an example shall I
correct it in 60 seconds?

2063
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:05,105
With your permission
Will you please go out?

2064
02:01:05,167 --> 02:01:06,669
Let me talk seriously
with the minister

2065
02:01:06,734 --> 02:01:08,611
Please, make it fast

2066
02:01:15,400 --> 02:01:17,243
What are you trying to do?

2067
02:01:17,701 --> 02:01:20,238
Are you doing gundaism
in minister's house?

2068
02:01:20,301 --> 02:01:21,678
Hey, not that

2069
02:01:21,800 --> 02:01:24,610
In the hall of
the minister's house

2070
02:01:24,668 --> 02:01:27,615
I'm going to openly urinate

2071
02:01:27,668 --> 02:01:31,309
- What are you doing this?
<i>- I'll</i> do it in dining room

2072
02:01:31,801 --> 02:01:34,077
What nonsense
are you doing this?

2073
02:01:34,167 --> 02:01:35,373
Sir, you call the police

2074
02:01:35,434 --> 02:01:37,175
I'll call the press
and channel people

2075
02:01:37,234 --> 02:01:40,613
As a flash news let them telecast
this urinating programme of mine

2076
02:01:40,667 --> 02:01:44,012
After this you won't be
known as the finance minister

2077
02:01:44,067 --> 02:01:46,343
- Then?
- MVMNM

2078
02:01:46,401 --> 02:01:47,505
What is that?

2079
02:01:47,567 --> 02:01:50,639
The minister in whose house
Mayor urinated and made it stink

2080
02:01:50,701 --> 02:01:52,078
The meaning of Mayor is not one...

2081
02:01:52,134 --> 02:01:53,613
...who does what he feels
like coming to a person's house

2082
02:01:53,668 --> 02:01:56,239
Are you mad?
Go to the toilet

2083
02:01:56,434 --> 02:01:59,711
When I urinate here and there,
you are telling me to go to toilet

2084
02:01:59,767 --> 02:02:02,714
That is why I told you to give
fund for constructing toilet

2085
02:02:02,800 --> 02:02:05,212
Ministers like you have
guest houses from that end of...

2086
02:02:05,300 --> 02:02:07,712
...Kerala to this end
of Kerala to urinate

2087
02:02:07,768 --> 02:02:09,406
But what will
the common man here do?

2088
02:02:09,468 --> 02:02:13,041
If without finding a solution
to my problem, you send me out...

2089
02:02:13,101 --> 02:02:15,081
...I'll get men from
Palakadu and make them...

2090
02:02:15,134 --> 02:02:17,136
...urinate and stink
around this house

2091
02:02:17,200 --> 02:02:20,374
Not only that stinking
I know about your illegitimate...

2092
02:02:20,434 --> 02:02:22,505
...relationship with
Eliamma and Velamma

2093
02:02:22,567 --> 02:02:25,275
If I put that in front of
the opposition today, tomorrow...

2094
02:02:25,334 --> 02:02:29,180
...I won't be speaking to
this Finance minister

2095
02:02:29,267 --> 02:02:30,439
God!

2096
02:02:30,601 --> 02:02:33,081
Asecret which is known
to only God, me, Eliamma...

2097
02:02:33,134 --> 02:02:36,604
...Vellamma and guest house,
howdid you know?

2098
02:02:36,667 --> 02:02:39,307
That is what Padmanabhan is,
Minister sir

2099
02:02:39,367 --> 02:02:43,179
When Padmanabhan starts for a job
he'll study everything inside out

2100
02:02:43,234 --> 02:02:45,373
Enemy's strength
and weakness

2101
02:02:45,567 --> 02:02:51,313
<i>Let me discuss your weakness
with your wife Annamma sister</i>

2102
02:02:51,367 --> 02:02:53,347
- Annamma sister!
- Talk slowly

2103
02:02:53,434 --> 02:02:57,473
lfAnnamma comes to know about Eliamma,
she'll put one in coffin alive

2104
02:02:57,601 --> 02:02:58,705
Did you call me?

2105
02:02:58,767 --> 02:03:03,045
Annamma! Just now
I talked about you

2106
02:03:03,201 --> 02:03:04,646
- Isn't it?
- Eliamma

2107
02:03:04,700 --> 02:03:06,077
Eliamma?

2108
02:03:06,201 --> 02:03:07,339
Rat and tortoise

2109
02:03:07,401 --> 02:03:10,007
Rat and tortoise?
What are you talking this?

2110
02:03:10,068 --> 02:03:13,345
We were laughing talking
about rat and tortoise race

2111
02:03:13,401 --> 02:03:13,970
Yes

2112
02:03:14,034 --> 02:03:15,069
Isn't that tortoise
and rabbit?

2113
02:03:15,134 --> 02:03:15,544
Is it?

2114
02:03:15,634 --> 02:03:18,080
Not wonder people call
you as foolish minister

2115
02:03:18,367 --> 02:03:20,347
Isn't this the Mayor?

2116
02:03:20,400 --> 02:03:22,573
He is the Mayor
You go inside

2117
02:03:22,634 --> 02:03:24,443
Don't think you can
send me like that

2118
02:03:24,501 --> 02:03:26,242
Some secret is
going on here

2119
02:03:26,300 --> 02:03:27,404
I also want to see

2120
02:03:27,467 --> 02:03:30,311
Gosh, shame
You unfold the dhoti

2121
02:03:30,401 --> 02:03:33,473
I want to tell about
the cultivation in Eliamma

2122
02:03:33,534 --> 02:03:35,605
It is not rat cultivation
It is cardamom cultivation

2123
02:03:35,668 --> 02:03:38,342
Did you buy
the estate in Elammavu?

2124
02:03:38,400 --> 02:03:39,470
It is not only an estate

2125
02:03:39,534 --> 02:03:40,706
There is a guest house
also in the middle

2126
02:03:40,768 --> 02:03:42,213
It is there that Eliamma...

2127
02:03:42,301 --> 02:03:45,407
Being an estate it'll have rat,
tortoise and snake

2128
02:03:45,468 --> 02:03:48,779
Will you please go?
Your job is double okay

2129
02:03:49,034 --> 02:03:50,411
- Are you sure?
- Sure

2130
02:03:50,467 --> 02:03:54,176
If there is any delay in my work,
I'll contact sister

2131
02:03:54,267 --> 02:03:57,612
If I'm alive,
your work is treble okay

2132
02:03:57,734 --> 02:04:07,121
"King...King...Wanderer King
King...King...Wanderer King"

2133
02:04:08,467 --> 02:04:10,208
I have also become
a photo

2134
02:04:16,101 --> 02:04:18,012
- Gosh!
- Greetings!

2135
02:04:18,100 --> 02:04:19,977
Who are these that have come?

2136
02:04:21,201 --> 02:04:22,680
Are you fine, sir?

2137
02:04:22,734 --> 02:04:25,738
You have thinned down

2138
02:04:27,534 --> 02:04:28,706
With or without?

2139
02:04:29,100 --> 02:04:30,545
Not that

2140
02:04:30,601 --> 02:04:31,773
I asked about tea

2141
02:04:32,034 --> 02:04:35,572
Did you see that heart?
No need for anything

2142
02:04:35,634 --> 02:04:37,580
Your asking itself
has fulfilled our heart

2143
02:04:37,634 --> 02:04:39,238
Forget the old

2144
02:04:39,300 --> 02:04:41,712
Many small problems
took place between us

2145
02:04:41,801 --> 02:04:44,213
I know that you have
some bad feelings about that

2146
02:04:44,267 --> 02:04:45,439
Forgive me

2147
02:04:45,734 --> 02:04:48,112
We are all humans,
Prakashan sir

2148
02:04:48,167 --> 02:04:50,443
There is bound to be clashes
between vessels and pots

2149
02:04:50,500 --> 02:04:53,140
We three of us
will be a team

2150
02:04:53,201 --> 02:04:55,511
I'll teach you the knack
of ruling corporation

2151
02:04:55,567 --> 02:04:58,138
You have to just sit
in the chair, brother

2152
02:04:58,500 --> 02:05:01,640
To tell the truth I'm scared
to sit in this chair, brother

2153
02:05:01,701 --> 02:05:03,009
You need not
fear anything, brother

2154
02:05:03,067 --> 02:05:03,738
I'm there

2155
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:05,445
I have 15 years experience

2156
02:05:05,501 --> 02:05:07,640
You sit here, brother
Rest I'll do

2157
02:05:07,767 --> 02:05:09,212
It is not that elder brother

2158
02:05:09,267 --> 02:05:11,577
There is lot of bug
in this chair

2159
02:05:11,800 --> 02:05:13,643
It is a curse
for Thiruvananthapuram

2160
02:05:13,701 --> 02:05:14,975
You just sprinkle
medicine for that

2161
02:05:15,034 --> 02:05:17,446
There are not bugs
which will die with medicine

2162
02:05:17,567 --> 02:05:19,547
I'm talking about the bug
which drank the blood of this...

2163
02:05:19,601 --> 02:05:23,640
...whole city sitting in
this chair for so many years

2164
02:05:24,067 --> 02:05:27,446
- Leave that, Padmanabhan
- Padmanabhan?

2165
02:05:27,500 --> 02:05:29,480
Sorry, Mayor sir
I came

2166
02:05:29,634 --> 02:05:32,137
to give you a small gift

2167
02:05:32,200 --> 02:05:33,304
Philipose

2168
02:05:34,701 --> 02:05:35,975
What is this?

2169
02:05:36,134 --> 02:05:38,978
A small gift
Only token

2170
02:05:39,067 --> 02:05:40,171
Tantadang...

2171
02:05:40,234 --> 02:05:42,407
Why? Why are you giving
so much money, Prakashan, sir?

2172
02:05:42,467 --> 02:05:44,344
So much? This is
a small amount

2173
02:05:44,401 --> 02:05:45,607
25 lakhs

2174
02:05:45,667 --> 02:05:49,979
- Big amount will follow
- Keep that in the top drawer

2175
02:05:50,034 --> 02:05:51,308
I usually keep it only there

2176
02:05:51,367 --> 02:05:52,004
Is it?

2177
02:05:52,067 --> 02:05:53,273
No one can see there

2178
02:05:54,434 --> 02:05:58,473
God! This is the first time I'm
seeing human being coming as god

2179
02:05:58,568 --> 02:05:59,774
One minute

2180
02:06:01,367 --> 02:06:02,243
Accounts section

2181
02:06:02,301 --> 02:06:03,712
All of you come inside

2182
02:06:04,734 --> 02:06:06,475
Wait a minute
They'll come just now

2183
02:06:06,534 --> 02:06:09,538
Are you going to share?
No need, brother

2184
02:06:09,634 --> 02:06:11,545
They have their quota
from the boss

2185
02:06:11,601 --> 02:06:13,672
This is exclusively
for you, brother

2186
02:06:14,134 --> 02:06:15,340
What is it, sir?

2187
02:06:15,434 --> 02:06:17,175
Keep his inside

2188
02:06:17,301 --> 02:06:20,407
This is a donation of
25 lakhs from Prakashan sir...

2189
02:06:20,467 --> 02:06:21,741
...for Mayor's relief fund

2190
02:06:21,800 --> 02:06:23,575
All of you clap

2191
02:06:25,468 --> 02:06:27,277
- Give him a receipt at once
- Okay

2192
02:06:27,334 --> 02:06:29,610
With that an appreciation letter
to Prakashan sir from mayor's side

2193
02:06:29,667 --> 02:06:30,236
okay

2194
02:06:30,300 --> 02:06:31,643
- Make it in Tamil
- Okay

2195
02:06:31,701 --> 02:06:33,271
- Varidakshan!
- Sir!

2196
02:06:33,501 --> 02:06:36,243
Tell building section superintendent
to bring the documents...

2197
02:06:36,300 --> 02:06:37,506
...that I asked for immediately

2198
02:06:37,567 --> 02:06:38,272
Sure, sir

2199
02:06:38,334 --> 02:06:41,076
I want the original documents
of the royal properties

2200
02:06:41,134 --> 02:06:41,737
okay

2201
02:06:41,800 --> 02:06:45,714
Many pans of those royal properties
are in private individual's hands

2202
02:06:46,368 --> 02:06:48,405
I need to study
all the in detail

2203
02:06:48,467 --> 02:06:49,445
Okay, sir

2204
02:06:49,634 --> 02:06:50,772
Padmanabha!

2205
02:06:51,068 --> 02:06:53,070
Remember with
whom you are playing

2206
02:06:53,134 --> 02:06:55,136
I remember very well,
Prakasham sir

2207
02:06:55,768 --> 02:06:57,679
When we decide to play
with a good player

2208
02:06:57,734 --> 02:06:59,111
...we must not think
about own strength

2209
02:06:59,168 --> 02:07:02,012
...instead we must learn
about the power of the rival

2210
02:07:02,134 --> 02:07:04,410
After studying only
I have landed on the ground

2211
02:07:04,501 --> 02:07:06,003
In the first move itself
I have scored point

2212
02:07:06,067 --> 02:07:07,171
Didn't you see that?

2213
02:07:07,334 --> 02:07:08,677
25 lakhs

2214
02:07:09,234 --> 02:07:11,646
After this one by one
all the games are going to start

2215
02:07:11,734 --> 02:07:16,513
Ko-ko, Kabadi, volley ball,
foot ball, hide and seek...

2216
02:07:16,567 --> 02:07:17,511
Hey!

2217
02:07:17,801 --> 02:07:20,213
Who do you think I'm?

2218
02:07:22,101 --> 02:07:25,674
When I tried to bend a bit,
are you trying to step on my head and climb?

2219
02:07:26,134 --> 02:07:29,081
I have seen hundreds
of Padmanabhan like you

2220
02:07:29,134 --> 02:07:32,047
At the age of 10
with flower basket on my head...

2221
02:07:32,100 --> 02:07:34,102
...I came to this city
from Thovalai

2222
02:07:34,168 --> 02:07:35,704
That time do you know
how much money I had with me?

2223
02:07:35,801 --> 02:07:39,248
Just Rs 10
I had only Rs 10

2224
02:07:39,301 --> 02:07:41,247
Today in this city
I have 10 bars

2225
02:07:41,301 --> 02:07:42,541
18 shopping complex

2226
02:07:42,601 --> 02:07:44,672
4 super specialty hospitals

2227
02:07:44,767 --> 02:07:46,405
3 engineering colleges

2228
02:07:46,467 --> 02:07:48,606
I made many people
shed blood and tears

2229
02:07:48,668 --> 02:07:50,170
After that only I have
reached this position

2230
02:07:50,234 --> 02:07:51,679
lfl close my eyes,
it is night

2231
02:07:51,767 --> 02:07:53,110
lfl open my eyes,
it is day time

2232
02:07:53,167 --> 02:07:54,510
That is my law

2233
02:07:55,567 --> 02:07:58,275
Seeing a tiger if a cat
goes to fight with that

2234
02:07:58,334 --> 02:08:01,178
...tiger will only laugh
You are just a cat to me

2235
02:08:01,667 --> 02:08:04,045
I thought I'll do
a compromise with you

2236
02:08:04,134 --> 02:08:06,671
But you have insulted me
in front of 10 people

2237
02:08:06,734 --> 02:08:08,008
Count down

2238
02:08:08,067 --> 02:08:10,308
From today your
destruction has started

2239
02:08:12,467 --> 02:08:14,344
In spite of this
if you clash with me...

2240
02:08:14,400 --> 02:08:16,778
...there won't be
head in your body

2241
02:08:17,501 --> 02:08:19,003
This is not an idle talk

2242
02:08:19,100 --> 02:08:21,205
It is this
Pushpam Prakashan's order

2243
02:08:21,301 --> 02:08:22,211
Order!

2244
02:08:22,267 --> 02:08:23,974
Remem ber it

2245
02:08:25,801 --> 02:08:26,711
Go, man

2246
02:08:26,767 --> 02:08:36,017
"King...King...Wanderer King
King...King...Wanderer King"

2247
02:08:40,167 --> 02:08:41,373
Out

2248
02:08:56,301 --> 02:08:59,339
Who is that?
What is that in your hand?

2249
02:08:59,401 --> 02:09:00,345
Milk sweet

2250
02:09:00,400 --> 02:09:02,676
Aspecial offering
from Padmanabha temple

2251
02:09:02,734 --> 02:09:04,680
- I don't eat sweet
- Why?

2252
02:09:04,767 --> 02:09:06,678
If I eat that,
the other thing will get spoilt

2253
02:09:06,734 --> 02:09:08,475
The other thing?
What is that?

2254
02:09:08,534 --> 02:09:10,536
The one injurious
to health

2255
02:09:10,601 --> 02:09:12,308
It cannot tolerate milk

2256
02:09:12,367 --> 02:09:13,471
Anyway you have brought it

2257
02:09:13,534 --> 02:09:15,172
<i>- I'll</i> eat
- No, no! Leave it

2258
02:09:15,301 --> 02:09:17,975
It is for Padmanabhan
It is special

2259
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:22,673
Left! Left!

2260
02:09:25,134 --> 02:09:27,478
- Is it Meera?
- Hi!

2261
02:09:27,767 --> 02:09:29,212
She is always after him

2262
02:09:29,267 --> 02:09:30,405
Doesn't she have a house?

2263
02:09:30,467 --> 02:09:34,381
In Rima's channel next Sunday
there is a special programme about me

2264
02:09:34,434 --> 02:09:35,970
This is the photo
session of that

2265
02:09:36,034 --> 02:09:37,445
To tell the truth,
it is due to Rima...

2266
02:09:37,500 --> 02:09:40,140
...that my brother-in-law
became a Mayor

2267
02:09:40,200 --> 02:09:41,770
That support should be
there till the end

2268
02:09:42,001 --> 02:09:43,071
Do you need to say that?

2269
02:09:43,134 --> 02:09:45,045
Where ever you go Padmanabhan,
I'll be there with you

2270
02:09:45,101 --> 02:09:47,012
If he goes to become a saint,
she might go behind him that time also

2271
02:09:47,067 --> 02:09:47,772
Idiot!

2272
02:09:48,001 --> 02:09:49,241
Why do you look upset?

2273
02:09:49,301 --> 02:09:50,041
Nothing

2274
02:09:50,101 --> 02:09:51,580
She might be short of money

2275
02:09:51,634 --> 02:09:56,049
Rima, why don't you get
this Meera a job in your channel?

2276
02:09:56,101 --> 02:09:58,103
Even a sweeper's job is okay

2277
02:09:58,701 --> 02:09:59,679
rn try

2278
02:09:59,734 --> 02:10:02,010
Okay, what is your
qualification, Meera?

2279
02:10:02,700 --> 02:10:05,010
- Isn't mother there?
- What is the matter?

2280
02:10:05,201 --> 02:10:06,703
I used to be
like this only before

2281
02:10:06,767 --> 02:10:09,179
If someone asks about my education,
I used to change the topic

2282
02:10:09,234 --> 02:10:11,180
I'm not changing the topic
I have enough qualification

2283
02:10:11,234 --> 02:10:13,145
Must be 10th class
and Dara Singh

2284
02:10:13,201 --> 02:10:15,374
- What?
- Fight, brother-in-law

2285
02:10:15,467 --> 02:10:17,140
What is that
in your hand, Meera?

2286
02:10:17,200 --> 02:10:18,042
Fingers

2287
02:10:18,100 --> 02:10:19,010
I know they are fingers

2288
02:10:19,101 --> 02:10:21,581
- What is it that you are holding?
-It is milk sweet, brother-in-law

2289
02:10:21,634 --> 02:10:22,977
Is it? Milk sweet?

2290
02:10:23,034 --> 02:10:25,480
Great! Till nowl have not
had the milk sweet here

2291
02:10:25,534 --> 02:10:26,308
Move away

2292
02:10:26,367 --> 02:10:27,971
- Give her some, Meera
- Hey!

2293
02:10:28,034 --> 02:10:30,742
- Give it to me
- Are you not giving milk sweet?

2294
02:10:31,467 --> 02:10:33,242
Is she also here?

2295
02:10:34,700 --> 02:10:38,705
- Is it, Meera?
- Come, dear

2296
02:10:38,767 --> 02:10:41,714
This is what they call
as luck in old age

2297
02:10:41,767 --> 02:10:45,180
Her Highness is coming home
and taking BP

2298
02:10:45,234 --> 02:10:46,474
Very good

2299
02:10:46,534 --> 02:10:48,536
She is sure to
increase my pressure

2300
02:10:48,601 --> 02:10:49,773
Did you say anything?

2301
02:10:50,001 --> 02:10:50,741
No

2302
02:10:52,167 --> 02:10:54,773
Actually I came
to see Padmanabhan

2303
02:10:55,034 --> 02:10:57,776
It was at that time mother said
that she has a doubt she has BP

2304
02:10:58,001 --> 02:10:59,309
So I checked her

2305
02:10:59,368 --> 02:11:01,405
Mother, I'll prescribe medicine

2306
02:11:01,467 --> 02:11:03,276
Eat that on time

2307
02:11:03,367 --> 02:11:06,143
From today I'm going
to look after your health

2308
02:11:06,234 --> 02:11:09,181
See to it that your health
doesn't get spoilt

2309
02:11:09,267 --> 02:11:10,439
This is good

2310
02:11:11,334 --> 02:11:12,540
Not bad
One second

2311
02:11:13,068 --> 02:11:14,308
That is better than this

2312
02:11:14,367 --> 02:11:16,142
Meera, come here

2313
02:11:16,200 --> 02:11:18,043
Where are you going in hurry?

2314
02:11:18,134 --> 02:11:19,704
See the photos
taken by Rima

2315
02:11:19,767 --> 02:11:21,075
Come here

2316
02:11:22,301 --> 02:11:23,279
Look at this snap

2317
02:11:23,367 --> 02:11:24,437
Give that milk sweet

2318
02:11:24,501 --> 02:11:25,980
Leave it, leave it

2319
02:11:26,034 --> 02:11:26,774
Give me a bit

2320
02:11:27,001 --> 02:11:28,241
- I said leave it
- Give her little bit

2321
02:11:28,301 --> 02:11:31,009
- Due to eagerness she is asking
- It is not for you

2322
02:11:31,100 --> 02:11:34,445
- Then you take it
- Meera! Stop there, Meera

2323
02:11:34,534 --> 02:11:35,774
Move away

2324
02:11:36,034 --> 02:11:38,014
- Let me tell a matter
- Move away

2325
02:11:38,067 --> 02:11:39,045
Listen to me

2326
02:11:39,100 --> 02:11:41,444
I'll forget that you are
Her Highness from palace

2327
02:11:41,501 --> 02:11:42,639
Move away

2328
02:11:42,801 --> 02:11:45,509
I'll move after telling
a small matter

2329
02:11:45,667 --> 02:11:48,546
Coming 15th is my engagement

2330
02:11:49,734 --> 02:11:52,681
The groom is Ravi Verma
He is in States

2331
02:11:52,734 --> 02:11:53,712
Promise?

2332
02:11:54,801 --> 02:11:57,281
God! It is the effect
of my prayer

2333
02:11:57,334 --> 02:12:01,510
I have prayed a lot to Padmanabhan
that you should get married soon

2334
02:12:01,567 --> 02:12:03,308
Won't you come
for engagement, Meera?

2335
02:12:03,401 --> 02:12:05,039
I'll come one day in advance

2336
02:12:05,101 --> 02:12:07,240
Did you hear, Pappetta?
I'll tell a truth

2337
02:12:07,334 --> 02:12:10,474
I have lot of respect
for Travancore royal family

2338
02:12:11,667 --> 02:12:12,737
See and learn

2339
02:12:12,801 --> 02:12:14,508
- What?
- Don't you understand?

2340
02:12:14,567 --> 02:12:19,243
- You must get married
- I do want to get married

2341
02:12:19,567 --> 02:12:21,342
But Arun is not ready

2342
02:12:21,434 --> 02:12:22,105
Arun?

2343
02:12:22,168 --> 02:12:25,206
Yes, it is one year
since my marriage is over

2344
02:12:26,734 --> 02:12:28,338
He is the guy

2345
02:12:30,268 --> 02:12:31,076
How is he?

2346
02:12:31,134 --> 02:12:32,977
Good
Good pair

2347
02:12:33,034 --> 02:12:35,275
This is the first time in world
one girl is happy hearing...

2348
02:12:35,334 --> 02:12:38,611
...about the marriage
of another girl

2349
02:12:38,767 --> 02:12:40,542
Shall I give
a glass of milk sweet?

2350
02:12:40,600 --> 02:12:41,510
No need

2351
02:12:42,534 --> 02:12:44,445
Didn't you bring
this for Padmanabhan?

2352
02:12:44,500 --> 02:12:45,501
First you give him

2353
02:12:54,168 --> 02:12:56,409
There are 100 years old documents here

2354
02:12:56,501 --> 02:13:00,142
On studying this I understood
that land worth crores is...

2355
02:13:00,200 --> 02:13:02,111
...in the hands of
the private individuals

2356
02:13:03,134 --> 02:13:05,239
Don't feel bad, Highness

2357
02:13:05,300 --> 02:13:10,613
Many of this land have exchanged hand
after people's rule came into action

2358
02:13:10,767 --> 02:13:17,184
The properties of the royal family
belong to the government

2359
02:13:17,267 --> 02:13:20,043
Yes, what you are saying is true

2360
02:13:20,267 --> 02:13:24,511
You can say there was
mistake from our side

2361
02:13:25,067 --> 02:13:29,209
During the last years of King's rule
there were many problems

2362
02:13:29,634 --> 02:13:35,676
Our people have given land on lease
to private individuals for expansion of city

2363
02:13:36,067 --> 02:13:40,015
We gave those lands
only on lease basis

2364
02:13:40,067 --> 02:13:42,013
Now the land is in
26 people's hand

2365
02:13:42,134 --> 02:13:45,343
Out of that 80% is in
Pushpam Prakashan's hand

2366
02:13:46,034 --> 02:13:48,776
The revenue land which comes under
city development must be got back

2367
02:13:49,001 --> 02:13:51,072
I'm going to start
activities for that

2368
02:13:51,167 --> 02:13:54,341
Tomorrowl'll give a detail
report to the government

2369
02:13:54,734 --> 02:13:58,045
I must have all kind of
backing from your side, Highness

2370
02:13:58,101 --> 02:14:02,174
Whatever decision you take
Padmanabhan for the welfare of this city...

2371
02:14:02,267 --> 02:14:04,144
...I'll fully back you

2372
02:14:09,467 --> 02:14:14,576
For the development of the city I'm
going to take up the second step activity

2373
02:14:14,667 --> 02:14:17,307
It is about that I explained here
Now you can ask questions

2374
02:14:17,400 --> 02:14:20,404
Your personal interest
is behind this decision

2375
02:14:20,467 --> 02:14:22,003
If I say this,
what will you answer?

2376
02:14:22,100 --> 02:14:23,443
I'll tell you to get lost

2377
02:14:25,200 --> 02:14:27,202
It is also your right
which I'm implementing

2378
02:14:27,267 --> 02:14:29,338
One individual is
constructing a building there

2379
02:14:29,400 --> 02:14:31,243
Isn't that your personal issue?

2380
02:14:31,334 --> 02:14:33,177
The parks which are meant
for your children to get air...

2381
02:14:33,234 --> 02:14:34,975
...and to play is in the hands
of an individual due

2382
02:14:35,034 --> 02:14:38,413
...to his man
and muscle power

2383
02:14:38,467 --> 02:14:40,469
Is that also
not your personal issue?

2384
02:14:40,534 --> 02:14:42,480
Asociety is
a collection of people

2385
02:14:42,534 --> 02:14:44,639
I'm taking this action
for that society

2386
02:14:44,700 --> 02:14:46,680
First thing you are taking
action against big buildings

2387
02:14:46,734 --> 02:14:48,645
That too like
Prakashan's Pushpam Tower

2388
02:14:48,701 --> 02:14:49,736
Won't that be a problem?

2389
02:14:49,801 --> 02:14:52,077
Isn't it better to go
from small to big?

2390
02:14:52,167 --> 02:14:56,047
In your house if a big snake
and a small rat enter,

2391
02:14:56,101 --> 02:14:58,411
...will you first handle
the small or the big one?

2392
02:14:58,500 --> 02:15:01,174
That Let us first destroy
the most poisonous one

2393
02:15:01,400 --> 02:15:03,346
Isn't that what is good, brother?

2394
02:15:04,434 --> 02:15:06,243
The Mayor wants
to destroy me

2395
02:15:06,401 --> 02:15:09,678
He says my Pushpam tower of
500 crores must be crushed...

2396
02:15:09,734 --> 02:15:11,975
...and destroyed like flower

2397
02:15:13,800 --> 02:15:16,110
Boss, what are you doing this?

2398
02:15:16,201 --> 02:15:20,616
What did you call me? Boss?
The one with money is boss

2399
02:15:20,701 --> 02:15:24,080
That Mayor is going to
take away all my wealth

2400
02:15:24,234 --> 02:15:26,407
In future I'll be only poor boss

2401
02:15:26,801 --> 02:15:28,644
Call me as poor boss

2402
02:15:28,700 --> 02:15:29,644
Call me

2403
02:15:29,734 --> 02:15:32,977
In that case shall we go
back to Thovalai, boss?

2404
02:15:33,067 --> 02:15:36,514
Should we go back?
Should I lose to him? No

2405
02:15:37,234 --> 02:15:40,340
If he is Padmanabhan,
then I'm Parama Shivan

2406
02:15:40,401 --> 02:15:43,314
I'll burn and destroy him

2407
02:15:45,501 --> 02:15:47,640
Sir, I'm returning back
from the temple

2408
02:15:47,701 --> 02:15:50,045
...after doing my father's
death anniversary prayers

2409
02:15:50,134 --> 02:15:51,442
I'll reach on time

2410
02:15:51,634 --> 02:15:53,079
The meeting should
start at 10:30

2411
02:15:53,134 --> 02:15:56,343
I have another appointment
I'll send Thasildar

2412
02:15:56,400 --> 02:15:59,643
It is a very important meeting
about road widening in city

2413
02:15:59,701 --> 02:16:02,272
PWD engineer, city police
commissioner will be there

2414
02:16:02,334 --> 02:16:03,472
You must be there, collector

2415
02:16:03,534 --> 02:16:04,774
I came told you personally

2416
02:16:05,034 --> 02:16:06,980
I told you that
I'll send Thasildar

2417
02:16:07,067 --> 02:16:09,013
You are reluctant to
take order from Mayor

2418
02:16:09,067 --> 02:16:10,102
Is that your problem?

2419
02:16:11,034 --> 02:16:14,243
If at sharp 10:30 you don't
reach corporation office...

2420
02:16:14,334 --> 02:16:15,711
...I'll come to
the collectorate

2421
02:16:15,767 --> 02:16:17,246
I won't be alone

2422
02:16:17,300 --> 02:16:19,371
The people of this city
will be with me

2423
02:16:19,500 --> 02:16:22,071
Don't you know me?
Do you want me to come?

2424
02:16:22,234 --> 02:16:23,975
No need
I'll reach there

2425
02:16:24,567 --> 02:16:25,978
That is what is correct

2426
02:16:28,167 --> 02:16:30,010
Did you get scared
seeing me, mother?

2427
02:16:30,100 --> 02:16:33,343
Only if some people are threatened,
this city will become good

2428
02:16:34,034 --> 02:16:36,571
You have the same nature
of your father

2429
02:16:45,167 --> 02:16:48,046
Look how he is going
inside the city limit?

2430
02:16:48,601 --> 02:16:51,673
Subhair, find out students of
which school are in that vehicle

2431
02:16:58,334 --> 02:17:01,144
- Move! Mother!
- My son!

2432
02:18:08,634 --> 02:18:10,307
Mother!

2433
02:18:16,400 --> 02:18:25,013
This last journey is
destined to everyone in his life

2434
02:18:36,234 --> 02:18:37,076
Greetings!

2435
02:19:14,167 --> 02:19:23,212
Brother, you don't be sad
No one can stop death

2436
02:19:24,434 --> 02:19:28,109
Thank god! Nothing serious
happened to our Mayor in this accident

2437
02:19:28,201 --> 02:19:30,613
For that I convey
my thanks to God

2438
02:19:32,268 --> 02:19:35,112
Your mother died
That is her fate

2439
02:19:35,634 --> 02:19:38,376
Not even God
can stop that

2440
02:19:40,334 --> 02:19:44,009
From childhood
I love flowers a lot

2441
02:19:44,300 --> 02:19:46,280
I'm born in the middle
of the flowers

2442
02:19:46,334 --> 02:19:51,010
But it is the wreath made out
of flowers which I don't like

2443
02:19:51,300 --> 02:19:57,342
God, don't make me
come here again with wreath

2444
02:19:58,667 --> 02:20:03,013
I don't have the power
to see your death, brother

2445
02:20:05,534 --> 02:20:08,071
Remove your hand, Dog

2446
02:20:13,167 --> 02:20:16,011
Your calculations misfired

2447
02:20:16,601 --> 02:20:20,174
Instead of me,
it is my mother

2448
02:20:20,300 --> 02:20:21,506
My Subhair

2449
02:20:25,034 --> 02:20:27,708
Now you are alive
in front of me...

2450
02:20:27,767 --> 02:20:30,407
...because I'm
the father of this city

2451
02:20:32,200 --> 02:20:36,580
After the last rites are over,
this mother's son will come...

2452
02:20:36,767 --> 02:20:40,738
...to see you with the weapons
to be used against you

2453
02:20:41,033 --> 02:20:43,013
If possible, you stop it

2454
02:20:53,367 --> 02:20:54,402
Let us see, brother

2455
02:21:14,201 --> 02:21:18,115
Lights! Our company
has done this in Europe...

2456
02:21:18,167 --> 02:21:20,044
...US and many other countries

2457
02:21:20,134 --> 02:21:22,580
These are those demolishing clips
which you now saw, sir

2458
02:21:22,634 --> 02:21:24,511
This won't cause damage
to any buildings...

2459
02:21:24,567 --> 02:21:26,046
...which are even
in 1km distance

2460
02:21:26,101 --> 02:21:27,580
It'll go directly
inside the earth

2461
02:21:27,634 --> 02:21:30,979
That is the major advantage
of the controlled demolishing

2462
02:21:31,100 --> 02:21:31,771
I accept

2463
02:21:32,134 --> 02:21:34,341
But this is not US or UK

2464
02:21:34,400 --> 02:21:35,276
This is Kerala

2465
02:21:36,100 --> 02:21:38,273
There are many
who want to see...

2466
02:21:38,367 --> 02:21:40,176
...the defeat of the mission
rather than success

2467
02:21:40,234 --> 02:21:43,272
There is a history of many of
these demolishing defeats

2468
02:21:43,333 --> 02:21:44,141
Of course

2469
02:21:44,234 --> 02:21:46,714
But that was before
Now the systems have changed

2470
02:21:46,767 --> 02:21:49,077
Totally controlled
by the computer

2471
02:21:49,201 --> 02:21:53,013
Once the start switch is
activated within 15 minutes

2472
02:21:53,100 --> 02:21:55,046
All the bombs will blast

2473
02:21:55,167 --> 02:21:57,579
In next 5 minutes
everything will be over

2474
02:21:59,167 --> 02:22:00,771
Welcome to Asianet News

2475
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:04,345
High court has given its
consent to Mayor Padmanabhans...

2476
02:22:04,400 --> 02:22:06,539
...decision to demolish
all those buildings in city

2477
02:22:06,601 --> 02:22:08,308
...which are built
against rules

2478
02:22:09,000 --> 02:22:11,412
Against this corporations
decision businessman...

2479
02:22:11,500 --> 02:22:13,707
...Pushpam Prakashan had
filed a case

2480
02:22:13,800 --> 02:22:16,974
...which was rejected
by the court

2481
02:22:17,067 --> 02:22:19,138
Hey! What are you staring?

2482
02:22:22,267 --> 02:22:23,177
You fool!

2483
02:22:24,667 --> 02:22:30,379
In parliament there is some
opposition in demolishing Pushpam towers

2484
02:22:30,434 --> 02:22:32,607
Pushpam Prakashan in not there in the city

2485
02:22:32,667 --> 02:22:34,340
The accusation is that
due to you...

2486
02:22:34,401 --> 02:22:36,972
...a businessman had
to leave the city

2487
02:22:37,667 --> 02:22:40,204
In this situation
many cases are coming to light

2488
02:22:40,267 --> 02:22:43,271
So he ran away from city
to avoid a police arrest

2489
02:22:44,034 --> 02:22:47,015
But law will surely
bring him to light

2490
02:22:47,100 --> 02:22:48,773
The one who ate salt
has to drink water

2491
02:22:49,000 --> 02:22:51,412
We hear that the chief minister
is also not very happy with you

2492
02:22:51,467 --> 02:22:53,606
To explain this matter tomorrow itself

2493
02:22:53,667 --> 02:22:55,044
I'll meet the chief minister

2494
02:22:56,767 --> 02:22:59,373
I was also proud to see
the activities of Vinay Chandran

2495
02:22:59,434 --> 02:23:03,246
I'll do everything to find him
You can go peacefully

2496
02:23:03,300 --> 02:23:04,108
Okay, sir

2497
02:23:05,000 --> 02:23:05,671
Come, dear

2498
02:23:08,700 --> 02:23:12,079
Tell them to speed up
Vinay Chandran's missing case

2499
02:23:12,134 --> 02:23:14,307
Tell DGP to give
a report to me at once

2500
02:23:14,700 --> 02:23:18,147
- Greetings, sir
- Have you come?

2501
02:23:19,067 --> 02:23:21,604
Else I was going
to come there to meet you

2502
02:23:21,701 --> 02:23:23,476
You are the Highness
of this state

2503
02:23:23,567 --> 02:23:25,171
Instead of mocking me,
tell me the matter

2504
02:23:25,233 --> 02:23:27,076
Who do you think you are?

2505
02:23:27,134 --> 02:23:29,273
It is the city
which you are going to spoil

2506
02:23:29,334 --> 02:23:32,679
At this very moment
you stop your demolition idea

2507
02:23:32,767 --> 02:23:34,747
The buildings which you
have in list...

2508
02:23:34,800 --> 02:23:36,108
...are the main
buildings of city

2509
02:23:36,167 --> 02:23:38,044
Even if it is a tree
which gives gold

2510
02:23:38,100 --> 02:23:39,545
...if we find that it is
dangerous for the roof

2511
02:23:39,600 --> 02:23:41,136
...we must chop it off
That is what is said

2512
02:23:41,200 --> 02:23:42,406
You need not
teach me anything

2513
02:23:42,467 --> 02:23:45,004
Mayor is just a post

2514
02:23:45,100 --> 02:23:47,307
A post which has
some special powers

2515
02:23:47,367 --> 02:23:50,211
Above all that there is
a thing called government

2516
02:23:50,600 --> 02:23:53,706
In this organization called
government there is an Act

2517
02:23:53,767 --> 02:23:57,146
In 1994, Kerala municipal act

2518
02:23:57,634 --> 02:23:59,773
In that from clause
No 7 to sub clause...

2519
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:01,240
...you read and see

2520
02:24:01,300 --> 02:24:02,779
You'll understand
the matter, sir

2521
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:05,480
As far as the city
is concerned Mayor...

2522
02:24:05,534 --> 02:24:08,174
...is above chief minister
according to the protocol

2523
02:24:08,234 --> 02:24:10,111
Have you come
to teach me protocol?

2524
02:24:10,167 --> 02:24:12,773
Then with your power
you try to do what you can

2525
02:24:13,001 --> 02:24:16,278
That time I'll show you
what is the power of a chief minister is

2526
02:24:17,034 --> 02:24:19,605
- Okay, sir
- Where are you going?

2527
02:24:20,267 --> 02:24:21,541
You only told me to go
and demolish

2528
02:24:21,600 --> 02:24:22,408
Shut up

2529
02:24:22,500 --> 02:24:25,106
You are talking to
the chief minister of the state

2530
02:24:25,167 --> 02:24:27,977
But chief minister
didn't talk in his language

2531
02:24:28,033 --> 02:24:30,070
You'll get respect only
if you give respect, sir

2532
02:24:30,133 --> 02:24:32,670
If you become calm...

2533
02:24:32,733 --> 02:24:35,213
I'll explain to you
in detail everything

2534
02:24:41,067 --> 02:24:42,444
This is the mall
which Pushpam Prakashan...

2535
02:24:42,533 --> 02:24:44,240
...has built against the rules

2536
02:24:45,367 --> 02:24:46,072
See this

2537
02:24:47,101 --> 02:24:48,774
This is RJ groups company

2538
02:24:50,133 --> 02:24:52,135
This is Abaze Plaza's
shopping mall

2539
02:24:52,201 --> 02:24:55,205
You examine the permits
given to these buildings

2540
02:24:56,200 --> 02:24:58,771
You'll understand about
the corruption...

2541
02:24:59,001 --> 02:25:01,311
...that is going on
under you in your office

2542
02:25:01,800 --> 02:25:04,371
Travancore royal dynasty
has given land to the corporation

2543
02:25:04,434 --> 02:25:05,412
Taking that into custody...

2544
02:25:05,467 --> 02:25:07,674
...Pushpam towers have
constructed their building

2545
02:25:07,767 --> 02:25:09,371
That construction
is causing more...

2546
02:25:09,433 --> 02:25:11,071
...and more accidents
in that road

2547
02:25:11,167 --> 02:25:12,646
You see here, sir

2548
02:25:13,134 --> 02:25:14,772
Due to this blind curve
in last one year...

2549
02:25:15,000 --> 02:25:17,742
...14 accidents have
taken place here

2550
02:25:18,100 --> 02:25:19,704
8 deaths have taken place

2551
02:25:24,267 --> 02:25:26,747
These buildings that you are talking
about are in the middle of the city

2552
02:25:26,801 --> 02:25:28,610
They are in the most
crowded areas

2553
02:25:28,667 --> 02:25:31,147
When you demolish them think
about the danger that will be caused

2554
02:25:31,200 --> 02:25:33,339
About the accidents
Who'll answer to all that?

2555
02:25:33,434 --> 02:25:34,674
I'll give the answer, sir

2556
02:25:34,734 --> 02:25:36,270
I have read
everything completely...

2557
02:25:36,334 --> 02:25:37,677
...and then only gone
ahead with this work

2558
02:25:37,767 --> 02:25:40,407
Not even a single sand
particles destruction will be there

2559
02:25:41,400 --> 02:25:44,006
But in this issue how many
people will be there with you?

2560
02:25:44,100 --> 02:25:45,443
This whole world
is with me, sir

2561
02:25:46,634 --> 02:25:50,013
This corporation decision
was conveyed through social networking sites

2562
02:25:50,100 --> 02:25:52,979
From then on we have been
getting lakhs of positives replies

2563
02:25:55,033 --> 02:25:56,034
See here, sir

2564
02:26:12,500 --> 02:26:14,502
People are seeing everything

2565
02:26:15,001 --> 02:26:17,709
Before they had no media
to express their views

2566
02:26:18,234 --> 02:26:19,611
Today that is not the state

2567
02:26:20,167 --> 02:26:23,307
We must convey to people that
in this you are also with me

2568
02:26:23,600 --> 02:26:27,412
Your support from
people will be 100%

2569
02:26:27,634 --> 02:26:31,605
Sure, sir! I have heard
my father saying this

2570
02:26:32,167 --> 02:26:34,738
Everyone can become
a pan of the history

2571
02:26:35,234 --> 02:26:39,478
But time will remember
only those who create history

2572
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:44,312
Then Mayor you alone need not
become famous by creating history

2573
02:26:44,600 --> 02:26:48,343
I also want a share in that
I'm there with you

2574
02:26:49,134 --> 02:26:50,704
- Go ahead
- Thank you, sir

2575
02:27:07,667 --> 02:27:08,975
You both move on

2576
02:27:09,034 --> 02:27:10,104
Steve, call all
the boys to come fast

2577
02:27:10,200 --> 02:27:12,043
- Okay, sir
- Fast, make it fast

2578
02:27:46,634 --> 02:27:49,478
When the mission is just nearby,
what does the Mayor has to say?

2579
02:27:49,534 --> 02:27:50,410
I have nothing to say?

2580
02:27:50,467 --> 02:27:52,037
Are you sure that
this mission will succeed?

2581
02:27:52,100 --> 02:27:53,101
We'll talk about
this later on

2582
02:27:53,200 --> 02:27:54,543
Wait, wait
What is this?

2583
02:27:54,600 --> 02:27:56,671
If you crowd up like this,
it is difficult

2584
02:28:01,500 --> 02:28:03,502
- Hello, sir
- Hello! ls everything okay?

2585
02:28:03,567 --> 02:28:04,204
100%

2586
02:28:05,633 --> 02:28:06,771
Go ahead

2587
02:28:07,000 --> 02:28:08,206
Are all the medicines ready?

2588
02:28:08,267 --> 02:28:09,439
- Sir!
- Yes

2589
02:28:12,634 --> 02:28:16,707
Atechnological excellence
is going to happen in front of us

2590
02:28:16,767 --> 02:28:20,579
In foreign counties the debris of
the demolishing goes under the earth

2591
02:28:20,667 --> 02:28:22,374
We have seen that in TV

2592
02:28:22,467 --> 02:28:24,504
Today we are going to see
that wonderful sight...

2593
02:28:24,567 --> 02:28:26,604
...directly for
the first time

2594
02:28:29,401 --> 02:28:31,244
All the arrangements
are perfect, sir

2595
02:28:31,767 --> 02:28:32,745
I'm in spot

2596
02:28:33,267 --> 02:28:36,009
Yes, I'm seeing
everything in TV

2597
02:28:36,467 --> 02:28:38,310
ls everything under control?

2598
02:28:38,367 --> 02:28:39,072
Yes, sir

2599
02:28:39,134 --> 02:28:40,636
Final action
is going to start

2600
02:28:40,700 --> 02:28:42,509
- Congratulations
- Thank you, sir

2601
02:28:43,434 --> 02:28:45,539
Isn't Highness coming?

2602
02:28:45,601 --> 02:28:47,103
He has gone to the temple

2603
02:28:47,167 --> 02:28:49,408
From there he'll
come here directly

2604
02:28:51,734 --> 02:28:57,082
- Sir, you look tensed
- This is an experiment

2605
02:28:57,134 --> 02:28:59,375
It'll take time
to make it a success

2606
02:29:00,067 --> 02:29:01,171
Won't I be tensed?

2607
02:29:01,234 --> 02:29:02,178
Trust us

2608
02:29:02,234 --> 02:29:04,714
Sir, everything is
perfectly done, sir

2609
02:29:04,801 --> 02:29:06,576
The connection has
been given to all bombs

2610
02:29:06,633 --> 02:29:09,273
Okay, then we'll start
Give a warning signal

2611
02:29:10,234 --> 02:29:13,238
Sir, now the time
is 9 o'clock

2612
02:29:13,301 --> 02:29:14,336
We can switch it on now

2613
02:29:14,467 --> 02:29:16,447
By 9:15 bombs
will start to blast

2614
02:29:16,500 --> 02:29:19,777
By 9:20 this building
will go under the earth as dust

2615
02:29:21,434 --> 02:29:22,435
Come and see, sir

2616
02:29:25,500 --> 02:29:26,137
Hello!

2617
02:29:26,200 --> 02:29:27,270
All of you
pay attention

2618
02:29:27,334 --> 02:29:29,041
Demolishing process
is starting

2619
02:29:29,101 --> 02:29:31,012
Once you hear the siren,
till the demolition is complete...

2620
02:29:31,067 --> 02:29:34,537
...no one should
cross this area

2621
02:29:34,601 --> 02:29:36,205
This is for your safety

2622
02:29:36,267 --> 02:29:37,371
Be careful

2623
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:42,671
Stan

2624
02:30:17,033 --> 02:30:19,206
Fire

2625
02:31:19,034 --> 02:31:21,571
- Yes
- Success!

2626
02:31:21,634 --> 02:31:22,612
God!

2627
02:31:24,767 --> 02:31:25,466
One by one all the cases against
Pushpam Prakashan are coming out

2628
02:31:25,467 --> 02:31:30,143
One by one all the cases against
Pushpam Prakashan are coming out

2629
02:31:30,200 --> 02:31:32,703
Pushpam Prakashan who
disappeared from here...

2630
02:31:32,767 --> 02:31:37,147
...was seen in Singapore
flight through CCTV

2631
02:31:37,200 --> 02:31:42,149
The enquiry for Prakashan
has been shifted to Singapore

2632
02:31:52,467 --> 02:31:53,537
Come inside, sir

2633
02:31:56,634 --> 02:31:57,009
Hello!

2634
02:31:57,067 --> 02:31:59,240
It is me
Pushpam Prakashan

2635
02:32:06,434 --> 02:32:08,277
- God!
- Start!

2636
02:32:36,367 --> 02:32:37,710
Have you come?

2637
02:32:37,800 --> 02:32:41,077
I never thought that
god will appear...

2638
02:32:41,134 --> 02:32:42,374
...so soon here
to uphold virtue

2639
02:32:42,434 --> 02:32:45,779
Highness, prince
has come to save you

2640
02:32:46,400 --> 02:32:47,504
What did you think?

2641
02:32:48,134 --> 02:32:52,378
Did you think that fearing
your case I left the city?

2642
02:32:52,434 --> 02:32:53,777
I'm a magician

2643
02:32:54,033 --> 02:32:56,138
You were searching for me
in the whole city

2644
02:32:56,234 --> 02:32:58,373
- But I was in this city only
- Now what do you want?

2645
02:32:58,467 --> 02:32:59,639
I want only you

2646
02:33:00,767 --> 02:33:06,274
In 10 minutes this building,
no my business empire will go to pieces

2647
02:33:06,800 --> 02:33:08,746
Below the earth
not only this building...

2648
02:33:08,801 --> 02:33:10,781
...but you both
will also get buried

2649
02:33:15,400 --> 02:33:18,609
This thumb is enough
to save my life

2650
02:33:18,701 --> 02:33:21,238
In half minute this lift
will be in the back passage

2651
02:33:21,367 --> 02:33:23,244
From there I'll escape

2652
02:33:24,034 --> 02:33:28,540
Within a month I'll
get back whatever I lost

2653
02:33:28,634 --> 02:33:34,277
For my new start the offering
to God is the life of you both

2654
02:33:34,367 --> 02:33:37,439
First you and
then your Highness

2655
02:33:37,533 --> 02:33:38,409
Hey, don't shoot

2656
02:34:02,134 --> 02:34:03,272
Come fast

2657
02:34:35,767 --> 02:34:38,304
Mother!

2658
02:35:01,800 --> 02:35:03,143
Wherever you might hide...

2659
02:35:03,201 --> 02:35:05,545
...I was waiting to
settle score by finding you

2660
02:35:05,600 --> 02:35:09,207
But I didn't think that you'll
come forward and fulfill it so soon

2661
02:35:09,267 --> 02:35:10,541
This is not shopping mall

2662
02:35:10,634 --> 02:35:13,547
This is a tomb which you have
built for yourself

2663
02:35:16,100 --> 02:35:17,044
No

2664
02:35:17,534 --> 02:35:19,639
Let god decide his fate

2665
02:35:19,700 --> 02:35:23,045
Yo u com e
Come

2666
02:35:26,567 --> 02:35:28,706
Highness, there is
only 2 minute, left

2667
02:35:28,767 --> 02:35:31,213
We can't reach through
staircase in that time

2668
02:35:41,034 --> 02:35:44,106
Instead of your life
I'm taking this thumb

2669
02:35:48,234 --> 02:35:52,239
Access granted
to Pushpam Prakashan

2670
02:35:52,301 --> 02:35:53,336
Highness, come

2671
02:35:56,667 --> 02:35:58,078
One minute is remaining

2672
02:35:58,201 --> 02:36:01,375
In the middle of so many sins
if by any chance you have done any virtue...

2673
02:36:01,434 --> 02:36:03,414
...you save yourself
Take it

2674
02:36:21,333 --> 02:36:22,311
Highness!

2675
02:37:01,167 --> 02:37:02,669
The one who takes
sword dies with sword

2676
02:37:02,733 --> 02:37:04,508
That is the principal
of nature

2677
02:37:04,600 --> 02:37:07,171
In the hole which he dug,
he fell himself

2678
02:37:07,467 --> 02:37:09,378
Highness, there is
a small correction

2679
02:37:09,434 --> 02:37:10,139
What is that?

2680
02:37:10,200 --> 02:37:13,238
In the mall built by him,
he got caught

2681
02:37:22,000 --> 02:37:25,504
Highness, it is there that
the children's play ground is going to come

2682
02:37:25,567 --> 02:37:27,342
- Here library
- Yes, sir

2683
02:37:27,434 --> 02:37:29,778
No one matching the image of
Prakashan boss has landed in Singapore

2684
02:37:30,033 --> 02:37:31,205
That is my report

2685
02:37:31,367 --> 02:37:34,314
But from Haridwar
a guy had called

2686
02:37:34,534 --> 02:37:37,640
A saint found in Himalaya
has resemblance of Prakashan

2687
02:37:37,701 --> 02:37:38,679
That is what he says

2688
02:37:38,767 --> 02:37:39,643
Sure, sir
Yes, sir

2689
02:37:39,701 --> 02:37:41,681
In Himalaya

2690
02:37:43,467 --> 02:37:45,674
It is all
Sri padmanabhan's decision
