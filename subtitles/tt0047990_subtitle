1
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:50,832
A hot, sultry day in May...

2
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:58,267
6 X 1 = 6
6 X 2 = 12

3
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:12,421
6 X 3 = 18
6 X 4 = 24

4
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:23,680
We'll eat raw mangoes.
- That's why l've brought salt!

5
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:36,120
6 X 5 = 30
6 X 6 = 36

6
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:48,786
Devdas is running away, sir.
- Devdas! Where are you going?

7
00:03:48,995 --> 00:03:52,192
Come here, you rascal.
Once you go, you never return.

8
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:56,334
Your father may be a rich man.
ln fact he only ordered...

9
00:03:57,203 --> 00:04:01,139
that you stay behind to study.
Bholu! What the hell do you do?

10
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:05,400
Listen carefully. lf he gives me
the slip, you'll have it!

11
00:04:05,211 --> 00:04:06,940
Now, give him some sums.

12
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:14,850
Here, do these sums.
- Go and sit there.

13
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:09,600
l can't do these.
- Show me.

14
00:05:12,278 --> 00:05:16,977
lf the cost of oil
is Rs.14.65, then...

15
00:05:17,216 --> 00:05:18,342
then this!

16
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:23,188
What happened? Where's Devdas?
- Sir...

17
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:27,393
Catch him!

18
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:40,610
You've spoilt my lime-powder.
- Wasn't my fault.

19
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:44,900
He pushed me, and ran off.
- Pushed you and ran off?

20
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:47,407
And you couldn't even stop him?
Hey! What are you laughing at?

21
00:05:47,613 --> 00:05:49,808
Where has he gone?

22
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:51,380
We couldn't catch him.
- Why?

23
00:05:51,584 --> 00:05:54,451
He threw stones at us.
- He hit me with one over here.

24
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:59,719
Blood!
- He broke your head?

25
00:06:00,226 --> 00:06:02,251
Let's all go to his father.

26
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:06,159
Let him see his son's deeds.
He'll not attend school anymore!

27
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:10,927
Come Bholu! What's this?
Pocketing my lime-powder, eh?

28
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:14,571
Not my fault.
- Empty your pocket... go on!

29
00:06:17,243 --> 00:06:20,178
Don't wipe your face as yet.
We've to show his father.

30
00:06:27,253 --> 00:06:32,122
Will Devdas be really rusticated?
- Can't say with this silly teacher.

31
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:35,226
l don't feel like attending myself!
Come.

32
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:44,463
Now you tell me what to do, sir.
- lt's a problem. My son?

33
00:06:45,104 --> 00:06:47,937
lf the fence starts to eat
the grass, who'll guard it?

34
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:50,750
Where is he?
- l don't know.

35
00:06:50,276 --> 00:06:52,107
When kids chased him, he...

36
00:06:52,311 --> 00:06:55,144
Where's that boy? Come here.
Look for yourself, Sir.

37
00:06:59,385 --> 00:07:04,186
Get Deva from wherever he is!
Don't worry, master.

38
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:09,453
Everybody is equal to me.
Deva will not be spared.

39
00:07:10,396 --> 00:07:11,454
Come on, boys...

40
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:23,100
Why are you by yourself today?
Where's Deva?

41
00:07:23,309 --> 00:07:26,608
He ran away.
- What do you mean?

42
00:07:26,846 --> 00:07:30,475
That chap fell in the lime-powder.

43
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:34,649
Have you seen Bholu's face?
Looks like a white washed house!

44
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:38,118
Will you just giggle, or explain?

45
00:07:38,324 --> 00:07:40,918
Tell me where Deva is.
- l don't know.

46
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:45,154
You know alright. Tell me.
He must be hungry.

47
00:07:45,364 --> 00:07:48,600
Sure. But l won't tell you
because he'll hit me it l do.

48
00:07:48,267 --> 00:07:53,680
l'll take some food for him.
- Do that, but listen...

49
00:07:53,272 --> 00:07:56,400
Coax him and bring him
home by evening.

50
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:58,872
Alright. l'll get him.

51
00:08:05,451 --> 00:08:08,181
Do you know what happened
in school today, Father?

52
00:08:11,357 --> 00:08:15,953
Silly! What happened?
- l'm very hungry.

53
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:18,528
l'll eat something and then tell you.
- Okay.

54
00:08:21,467 --> 00:08:24,527
Mummy, l'm famished.
Give me something to eat.

55
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:37,315
ls that all? lt's not enough.
- This is your daily quota.

56
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:41,352
Why extra today?
- Give her. lt's nothing heavy.

57
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:43,886
Just puffed-rice.
Give my darling girl some more.

58
00:08:49,328 --> 00:08:50,386
Happy?

59
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:15,918
Who's there?

60
00:09:16,422 --> 00:09:17,946
lt's you, Paro. Come.

61
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:22,924
Smoking tobacco again, eh?
- So what? All men do it.

62
00:09:25,531 --> 00:09:27,999
Get something to bite, eh?
Good!

63
00:09:30,369 --> 00:09:32,394
What did our teacher do?

64
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:35,333
He went and reported
to your father.

65
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:41,700
He told my father? Then?
- He won't let you attend school.

66
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:45,110
Never mind. l never wanted to
study anyway. Give me sweets.

67
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:46,741
l didn't bring any.

68
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:49,420
Get water.
- From where?

69
00:09:49,655 --> 00:09:52,385
No sweets, no water...
What the hell! Go get water!

70
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:55,186
l won't go, because you'll
run away from here.

71
00:09:55,394 --> 00:09:56,383
l won't. Go.

72
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:59,640
No...
- No? Go, l say!

73
00:10:08,507 --> 00:10:11,340
l'll go and tell everything
to your father!

74
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:17,410
Listen Paro...
Get lost!

75
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,418
l looked everywhere, father.
No sign of him.

76
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,127
Where can he be?

77
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:34,270
Why are you crying, dear?
- Deva hit me!

78
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:36,360
Where is he?
- ln the orchard.

79
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:39,470
Do you know? He smokes
tobacco on the sly too.

80
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:44,371
What! He smokes also now?
Calamity indeed. Bad times ahead.

81
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:47,740
No school or food for him from now.
Devidas, go this moment...

82
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:51,883
and get him here somehow!
Pernicious! Bane to the family!

83
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:09,191
Catch him! Stop him!

84
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:11,290
Can't you see?
- Catch him!

85
00:11:21,814 --> 00:11:25,807
Run away from school, eh?
Pick fights too. Rascal!

86
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:29,787
Stop it!
You've beaten him enough. Stop!

87
00:11:30,723 --> 00:11:34,124
Thrash him verbally,
but don't kill him!

88
00:11:34,326 --> 00:11:37,227
Shut up.
Your leniency has spoilt him!

89
00:11:37,596 --> 00:11:41,191
Nobody dare open this door.
And no food him either!

90
00:11:48,674 --> 00:11:50,539
Come and eat your food.

91
00:11:50,743 --> 00:11:55,900
No!
- Come son.

92
00:11:56,916 --> 00:12:02,479
Paro, your food's getting cold.
- l won't eat. l've a tummy-ache.

93
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:58,466
Come here, Paro.

94
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:12,487
Why did you tell him l smoked?
- Why did you hit me?

95
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:14,852
Why didn't you get water?
- Why do you scold me?

96
00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:18,459
Silly! Now don't squeal on me again.

97
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:21,130
Then don't hit me again.
- l won't.

98
00:13:21,934 --> 00:13:25,870
You mean you have forgiven me?
- Yes, want it in writing?

99
00:13:26,605 --> 00:13:31,800
Let's go to Rambabu's garden.
l'll get you a baby-bird.

100
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:55,924
Keep this money with you.

101
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,580
''Dear wonderful bird,
your place is far away''

102
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:24,922
''Once you leave a branch
when will you return to it?''

103
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:49,651
''The blue sky is your swing...
- Not a swing, but a courtyard''

104
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:55,157
''The blue sky is your courtyard
and the rainbow your swing''

105
00:14:58,631 --> 00:15:03,193
''ln the litter of your bright
wings you fly with gay abandon''

106
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:11,750
''With a cocky walk, a heady look,
and a beautiful face to boot''

107
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:38,395
''Come down from that branch
and listen to what l say''

108
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:46,538
''Our house is nearby.
Come and choose your grain''

109
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:54,276
''Today be our guest
and sing and laugh...''

110
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,853
''No, laugh and sing...
- Dear bird''

111
00:16:21,046 --> 00:16:25,608
''lf you've to go, then let us
dress you up with flowers''

112
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:33,524
''Let us kiss your forehead,
and put bells on your feet''

113
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:41,195
''Then go away happily
wherever you want to go''

114
00:17:08,827 --> 00:17:14,600
Father, a man had come weeping that
his fishing net in the water...

115
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:19,670
... was torn to pieces by Devdas.
- His pranks are getting worse!

116
00:17:20,005 --> 00:17:24,874
l'll send him to Calcutta to your
brother. He'll he ruined here.

117
00:17:25,077 --> 00:17:29,275
To the city, at such a young age?
- No Mother, don't spoil it now.

118
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:34,748
lt's for his own good.
- Okay. Do what you think right.

119
00:17:34,953 --> 00:17:36,614
l won't interfere at all.

120
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:41,983
l won't go.
- Don't cry, son.

121
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:44,422
l won't go to Calcutta...

122
00:17:45,197 --> 00:17:52,126
l'm not happy to send you away too.
But you'll study better there.

123
00:17:52,871 --> 00:17:54,463
Now come along.

124
00:18:00,212 --> 00:18:03,579
Go and sit in the carriage.
Go on.

125
00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:10,649
Don't cry while leaving.
l'll be there with you.

126
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:12,790
And during holidays,
we'll come back here.

127
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:14,788
l won't go!

128
00:18:14,993 --> 00:18:16,722
Let's see how you don't.
Get in.

129
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:27,128
Coachman, let's go.

130
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:52,422
l'll come during the holidays.

131
00:19:28,267 --> 00:19:30,326
Hey, listen...

132
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:35,934
Do you know how to sing?
- Of course, why not?

133
00:19:36,141 --> 00:19:37,369
Then sing.

134
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:42,206
One doesn't sing for the heck of it.
We must be paid.

135
00:19:42,447 --> 00:19:44,574
Let's go to your house and sing.
- No... not at home, but here.

136
00:19:44,816 --> 00:19:49,344
You'll have to give pennies...
- Pennies? l've just got Rupees!

137
00:19:49,621 --> 00:19:53,489
Rupees? Come child...
Let's go under that tree there.

138
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:14,272
''Come and meet me dear Krishna...
come and meet''

139
00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:25,790
''Come, dear Krishna, your Radha's
roaming all alone, looking lost''

140
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:36,130
''Roaming all alone, looking lost.
- So come Krishna, come and meet her''

141
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:52,315
''We all miss you so terribly
in Vrindavan, dear Lord...''

142
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:57,283
''We miss you so very much,...''

143
00:20:57,556 --> 00:21:01,253
''The day your topic comes up,
our haunted eyes overflow''

144
00:21:01,493 --> 00:21:06,226
''Our haunted eyes overflow...''

145
00:21:06,498 --> 00:21:10,127
''Even now we worry in mind,
what will happen in future''

146
00:21:10,869 --> 00:21:14,396
''For your Radha's roaming
all alone, looking lost''

147
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,406
''Radha's roaming, looking lost;
so come Krishna...''

148
00:21:37,896 --> 00:21:41,798
''You still haven't sent us
any news about yourself''

149
00:21:51,209 --> 00:21:57,409
''We still have no news from you.
- No news from you...''

150
00:21:58,116 --> 00:22:01,677
''Every girl in Vrindavan has
gone mad crying over you''

151
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:13,522
''Come and console them,
show your face O Lord...''

152
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:16,859
''For your Radha's roaming
all alone, looking lost''

153
00:22:17,069 --> 00:22:20,197
''Radha's roaming alone and lost.
- So come, dear Lord, come''

154
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:34,213
Truly lovely!
lt brought tears to my eyes.

155
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:39,422
And why not? The song is profound.
One day Krishna had hidden himself.

156
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:44,128
And when he couldn't be found,
Radha had sung this song fervently.

157
00:22:45,297 --> 00:22:50,980
Here, take this.
for you... and you too.

158
00:22:50,302 --> 00:22:52,167
Rs. 3/-? Whose are they?

159
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:55,330
Devdas's.
- Won't he get angry?

160
00:22:55,273 --> 00:22:59,972
No, he's gone to Calcutta.
You all got your money, didn't you?

161
00:23:00,245 --> 00:23:03,214
Yes, my dear.
You're very generous.

162
00:23:03,515 --> 00:23:07,246
May you become a queen
to some king, my dear.

163
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:24,335
From tomorrow l'll go to school
again. l feel very lonely.

164
00:23:24,536 --> 00:23:30,310
Okay, do that.
Listen, do one chore for me.

165
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:32,604
Take this pot, and get
some water from the pond.

166
00:24:31,703 --> 00:24:35,264
Your Devdas has come back.

167
00:24:35,607 --> 00:24:38,201
Who told you?
- The wind!

168
00:24:39,778 --> 00:24:44,272
l saw him with my own eyes.
A cane in hand, watch on wrist.

169
00:24:44,516 --> 00:24:46,814
Gold buttons chain...
He has become a real gentleman!

170
00:24:48,453 --> 00:24:50,284
He used to come here every year
in his holidays before.

171
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:55,586
Then he came once in 2-3 years.

172
00:24:56,228 --> 00:24:59,720
Don't know what has brought him here
this time. Maybe he remembered you!

173
00:25:10,542 --> 00:25:12,772
What are you looking at?
- Nothing.

174
00:25:30,595 --> 00:25:32,324
Please plait my hair for me.

175
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:36,331
lt's not evening as yet,
silly girl.

176
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:41,404
So what? Do it for me.
My sweet, dear Grandma.

177
00:25:57,589 --> 00:26:00,581
l hear Devdas is here.

178
00:26:01,826 --> 00:26:05,318
Before, whenever he came,
he used to drop in.

179
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:10,331
But today, he still hasn't come.
- The city does that to you.

180
00:26:10,535 --> 00:26:15,234
Man changes in every respect.
Maybe Devdas has changed too!

181
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,271
Aunty...

182
00:26:17,509 --> 00:26:19,841
lsn't that Devdas's voice?
- Yes.

183
00:26:25,317 --> 00:26:30,846
Devdas! You look so different.
Come right in, son.

184
00:26:33,458 --> 00:26:37,360
Bless you. You have a long life.
We were just talking about you.

185
00:26:37,729 --> 00:26:43,463
You really look different.
- Because we're meeting after ages!

186
00:26:44,235 --> 00:26:47,534
Where's Paro?
- She was just here.

187
00:26:47,739 --> 00:26:49,700
Must have gone upstairs.

188
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:55,341
Devdas is here, dear.
- Never mind. l'll go upstairs.

189
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:41,910
So, how's everything?

190
00:27:48,533 --> 00:27:50,330
You're so grown up!

191
00:27:55,807 --> 00:28:00,730
Okay... it's pretty late.
l'll go home.

192
00:28:10,455 --> 00:28:13,390
What's this? You just came,
and you're already leaving?

193
00:28:13,792 --> 00:28:18,388
l'm tired after the journey.
l'll come again tomorrow.

194
00:28:23,668 --> 00:28:26,136
Has Devdas gone?
- Yes.

195
00:28:26,671 --> 00:28:29,469
He and Paro get along so well.

196
00:28:29,674 --> 00:28:33,132
And why not?
They've grown up together.

197
00:28:33,611 --> 00:28:37,411
lf they wed, what a lovely
couple they'll make!

198
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:42,449
Why not approach his father?
- How is that possible?

199
00:28:42,654 --> 00:28:47,318
Why build castles in air?
They're high-caste landlords.

200
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:52,462
lf caste is important, so is beauty.
Our Paro is a dazzler!

201
00:28:52,664 --> 00:28:57,330
l'll go and see Devadas's mother.
Let's see how she refuses!

202
00:29:07,612 --> 00:29:10,979
l think l've left the store-room
open. Go and check, dear.

203
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:20,453
Paro's grandma spoke to me
about Paro's marriage.

204
00:29:20,725 --> 00:29:23,523
Naturally.
She must get married now.

205
00:29:23,728 --> 00:29:26,993
That's why she brought up the topic.
She said if Devdas...

206
00:29:27,699 --> 00:29:31,157
And what did you reply?
- l? l refused outright.

207
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:34,803
Good, they are not of our level...

208
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:38,104
then to have them next-door.
Don't get influenced by them.

209
00:31:00,458 --> 00:31:02,426
You really can't see
where you're going!

210
00:31:08,766 --> 00:31:12,725
Mother, who asked you to approach
Devdas's mother for Paro's hand?

211
00:31:13,004 --> 00:31:17,600
You could've talked to me first.
Landlords! Of higher caste!

212
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:23,679
l would've never approached anyway!
We needn't beg to get her married.

213
00:31:23,915 --> 00:31:26,611
People will beg for her instead!
Why are you worried?

214
00:31:26,851 --> 00:31:28,716
l can't help it, son.
- Stop it!

215
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,649
You think nobody has approached.

216
00:31:30,855 --> 00:31:34,518
l've got 6 proposals for her!
See if l don't get her married...

217
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:36,853
to a bigger landlord than
our neighbours here!

218
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:42,397
l'll fix everything within a week.
ln fact, l'll go right now!

219
00:32:16,868 --> 00:32:19,735
Where are you going, Paro?
- To get some water.

220
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:22,406
Just give me the chillies
l've put out to dry in the sun.

221
00:32:43,861 --> 00:32:46,659
Why have you stopped here, Paro?
- Just like that.

222
00:32:56,941 --> 00:32:59,501
Tell me, how old is the groom?

223
00:32:59,844 --> 00:33:02,506
Whose groom?
- Yours, of course.

224
00:33:04,115 --> 00:33:10,200
About 23-24 yrs. old.
- What! l heard he's over 40!

225
00:33:11,255 --> 00:33:16,716
l don't know who's over 40.
l don't keep a track on everyone.

226
00:33:16,928 --> 00:33:22,195
l just know that my groom will be
about 23-24 yrs. old.

227
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,734
And, his name?

228
00:33:25,136 --> 00:33:29,732
You know everything about me,
and not this?

229
00:33:29,941 --> 00:33:36,730
How will l know your mind?
- Oh? Then come close... closer...

230
00:33:38,249 --> 00:33:43,118
Shameless girl! Don't be funny!
Tell me his name.

231
00:33:43,921 --> 00:33:46,890
l just told you.
- But Grandma told me you're...

232
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:51,753
engaged to somebody from Manekpur.
- How can that be?

233
00:33:51,963 --> 00:33:55,126
lt'll be me,
who'll get married, not grandma!

234
00:33:55,933 --> 00:34:00,597
So it's all cooked from your side...
All planned in secrecy, eh?

235
00:34:00,938 --> 00:34:06,690
Nothing is cooked as yet.
- What nonsense! l don't understand.

236
00:34:07,745 --> 00:34:12,341
Then l'll ask Devdas and tell you.
- Ask him what? lf he'll wed you?

237
00:34:12,583 --> 00:34:14,710
Of course!
- Just think...

238
00:34:14,952 --> 00:34:18,718
you'll ask him yourself?
Aren't you ashamed?

239
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:22,992
Why? Did l feel ashamed
to tell you?

240
00:34:23,194 --> 00:34:27,255
l'm a woman, plus your friend.
But, he's a man, after all.

241
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:32,867
True, you're a woman, and
a friend. But is he a stranger?

242
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:36,802
What l can tell you,
can't l tell him?

243
00:34:38,209 --> 00:34:45,342
You're a married woman, and
don't you know what is a husband?

244
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:51,886
He's my husband... my master. Why
should l be ashamed in his presence?

245
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:55,953
Manorama, somebody is here
to call you home.

246
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,991
Okay Paro, l'll see you.

247
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:19,871
Who is it?
- lt's me.

248
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:01,984
You?

249
00:37:11,195 --> 00:37:13,789
Have you come alone
so late at night?

250
00:37:13,998 --> 00:37:16,570
Yes.
- Really?

251
00:37:17,201 --> 00:37:21,934
Didn't you feel scared on the way?
- l'm not scared of ghosts.

252
00:37:22,206 --> 00:37:29,806
Okay, but what about men?
- l think not, at this moment.

253
00:37:33,451 --> 00:37:36,614
How did you come in?
Did anybody see you?

254
00:37:38,389 --> 00:37:45,454
The watchman did.
- Even the servants must've seen.

255
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:47,731
Maybe.

256
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:57,632
Why did you do this? Won't your
head hang in shame tomorrow?

257
00:37:59,243 --> 00:38:05,113
lt would, if l didn't know,
that you'd stand up for me.

258
00:38:05,883 --> 00:38:09,842
l? But how will l show
my face too?

259
00:38:10,388 --> 00:38:12,982
You? Why not?

260
00:38:14,258 --> 00:38:21,323
You're a man. lf not tomorrow,
in a few days you'll be forgiven.

261
00:38:22,166 --> 00:38:29,868
Soon, nobody will remember, when,
which night, unfortunate Paro,...

262
00:38:30,074 --> 00:38:34,841
had come to you, thinking
you were everything to her.

263
00:38:38,182 --> 00:38:44,382
l was thinking of your reputation.
- Reputation? Nothing wrong with it.

264
00:38:45,189 --> 00:38:51,788
lf l get a bad name for having
come to you on the sly... so be it.

265
00:38:52,296 --> 00:38:58,633
Hey! You're crying.
- There's so much water in the river.

266
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:01,204
Won't it be enough to
wash away my stigma?

267
00:39:01,405 --> 00:39:03,396
Don't talk like that.

268
00:39:04,975 --> 00:39:09,344
l can do anything for you.
But...

269
00:39:11,449 --> 00:39:14,475
You know my parents
are against it.

270
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:19,385
lf l marry you against their wish,
where will you be?

271
00:39:22,259 --> 00:39:23,783
At your feet.

272
00:39:27,331 --> 00:39:29,891
Give me a little
space here, master.

273
00:39:44,248 --> 00:39:45,875
Let me see you to your house.

274
00:39:46,517 --> 00:39:48,849
You'll come with me?
- Why not?

275
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:56,126
lf you could come, why not me?
We'll get a bad reputation...

276
00:39:56,327 --> 00:39:59,125
So fine. We may find solution
for ourselves through it.

277
00:40:00,464 --> 00:40:01,761
Let's go then.

278
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:21,146
Neither your father,
nor brother will agree to it.

279
00:40:21,452 --> 00:40:24,478
Why stir a hornets nest
for such a small matter.

280
00:40:26,323 --> 00:40:28,188
lt might be a small matter for you.

281
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:36,931
How dare you ask such a thing?
Didn't you think of our prestige?

282
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:47,900
Silence! Stop blabbering!
One more word, and l disown you!

283
00:40:48,078 --> 00:40:49,807
Get out of my sight!

284
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:09,940
Where are you going, son?
- Calcutta.

285
00:41:09,333 --> 00:41:11,528
What! Listen,...

286
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:33,120
He's going to Calcutta. Bring him
back. Tell him l'm calling him.

287
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:37,886
Your mother's calling you.
Come back, Devdas.

288
00:42:29,313 --> 00:42:32,612
l hear he's gone to Calcutta.
- Yes.

289
00:42:33,083 --> 00:42:34,983
And what about you?

290
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:42,181
Must be having something in mind.
l know him well. Trust him too.

291
00:43:22,866 --> 00:43:24,993
Dead to the world!

292
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:41,877
Devdas!
When did you come?

293
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:48,725
You're like a mirage.
Seen one moment, gone the next!

294
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:51,721
lt's so late.
Why aren't you asleep?

295
00:43:52,563 --> 00:43:55,930
One can't sleep every might.
- Don't get sleep?

296
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:02,397
l thought good boys like you,
never saw moon-lit midnights.

297
00:44:02,606 --> 00:44:04,471
But now l know better.

298
00:44:07,511 --> 00:44:12,278
What is it? Why this silence?
Anything wrong?

299
00:44:14,518 --> 00:44:16,349
You have a problem, l think.

300
00:44:17,454 --> 00:44:19,922
Don't you?
- Not at all.

301
00:44:22,259 --> 00:44:29,324
Never experienced sorrow?
- Of course. But then this is life.

302
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:37,733
Face it happily, or cry over it. To
be happy, one has to cheat oneself.

303
00:44:39,610 --> 00:44:45,412
But why do you ask all this?
- Because l like to hear.

304
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:50,252
Really? Then one day
l'll narrate and you listen.

305
00:44:55,759 --> 00:44:57,784
Where do you disappear
throughout the night?

306
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:06,980
Don't pretend. Don't you know?
- l do, but not properly.

307
00:45:06,303 --> 00:45:10,296
Well, to know properly, you'll
have to become a dandy like me.

308
00:45:11,809 --> 00:45:14,300
l'm told that one forgets
ones sorrows there.

309
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:16,120
Very true.

310
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:23,950
Then take me there with you.
- You? You'll come with me? Okay.

311
00:45:24,688 --> 00:45:28,784
We'll go tomorrow.
Now go to sleep. Go on.

312
00:45:57,921 --> 00:46:03,450
Paro, ever since l've come here,
l've thought of nobody but you.

313
00:46:04,862 --> 00:46:08,798
Neither of my parents wish
to see us married.

314
00:46:09,633 --> 00:46:15,710
l can't find a solution to this.
lf l think of your happiness...

315
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:19,265
l'll give my parents a shock
which l can never dream of doing.

316
00:46:20,677 --> 00:46:24,545
That night when you staked
everything and came to me...

317
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:27,307
when l recall it,
it hurts me so very much.

318
00:46:28,786 --> 00:46:34,452
But let me make it clear here,
l never realised l loved you.

319
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:49,496
l just feel so sad that you'll
suffer so much because of me.

320
00:46:49,706 --> 00:46:51,606
Please try and forget it.

321
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:56,143
May God give you
success in this.

322
00:47:11,795 --> 00:47:13,854
Just go and post this.
- Very well.

323
00:47:38,755 --> 00:47:43,692
How could you do this?
- What?

324
00:47:43,894 --> 00:47:45,384
You did nothing.

325
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:51,430
She was your childhood friend.
She put her reputation at stake...

326
00:47:51,668 --> 00:47:55,434
and asked a place at your feet.
And you ran here without meeting her?

327
00:47:58,775 --> 00:48:01,869
l was helpless.
My parents were against it all.

328
00:48:02,412 --> 00:48:07,543
Yes, but how could you lie
that you didn't love her?

329
00:48:11,788 --> 00:48:17,590
There was no other way out.
- But you know how proud...

330
00:48:17,794 --> 00:48:23,610
and adamant Paro can be.
Know how your letter will affect her?

331
00:48:25,702 --> 00:48:30,105
The river is full of water.
Enough to wash away the stigma.

332
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:39,943
Coming...

333
00:48:41,652 --> 00:48:44,553
Where's the letter l gave you?
- l just posted it.

334
00:49:06,810 --> 00:49:09,802
Aren't you going out?
- l'm just getting ready for that.

335
00:49:10,013 --> 00:49:13,676
Will you cart all this with you?
- Where can l leave it?

336
00:49:13,917 --> 00:49:17,409
My good man, l leave
my things here too.

337
00:49:18,055 --> 00:49:20,523
l don't aim to come back here.

338
00:49:22,926 --> 00:49:25,986
''l used to be proud of him. And he
couldn't even do this much for me''.

339
00:49:26,196 --> 00:49:29,222
''He couldn't keep my bedding,
nor pay my rent for me''.

340
00:49:29,566 --> 00:49:33,229
Come without this tonight.
Tomorrow you can take it with you.

341
00:49:34,838 --> 00:49:39,200
l'm going home.
- Home? And when will you return?

342
00:49:39,843 --> 00:49:46,510
Never! Had l known that l'd have
to lose everything to come here.

343
00:49:47,884 --> 00:49:51,547
That l'd be looted...
l'd have never come here.

344
00:49:55,525 --> 00:50:00,530
But, what have you lost?
- l'll tell you if we meet again.

345
00:50:02,933 --> 00:50:07,630
Take this money to pay my bill
and give the rest to the servants.

346
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:29,124
Take this inside.
l'll just come.

347
00:50:35,432 --> 00:50:38,595
Whose letter was it?
- For your daughter.

348
00:50:47,010 --> 00:50:50,468
But l never realised
that l loved you.

349
00:50:52,249 --> 00:50:57,277
Mother! Paro's in-laws
have come to bless her.

350
00:51:52,075 --> 00:51:53,508
Wait!

351
00:51:56,113 --> 00:51:58,479
l'm here now.
- What for?

352
00:51:59,316 --> 00:52:01,580
Don't you remember that night?

353
00:52:02,052 --> 00:52:08,423
Of course, and also your letter.
- Forgive me. l wrote it in haste.

354
00:52:09,059 --> 00:52:11,857
l don't know what came over me...
l couldn't even think.

355
00:52:12,062 --> 00:52:15,190
Shut up! l don't want excuses!
- Listen Paro...

356
00:52:16,133 --> 00:52:22,300
l'll convince my parents somehow.
- Your parents! And what about mine?

357
00:52:22,272 --> 00:52:26,834
Don't they have a say too?
- Yes, but they're not against us.

358
00:52:27,043 --> 00:52:29,603
They are!
Let me go now. Get aside.

359
00:52:31,081 --> 00:52:35,609
Have you totally forgotten me?
- l don't trust the likes of you.

360
00:52:35,852 --> 00:52:40,118
My parents care for me. Whatever
they've done is for my own good.

361
00:52:40,323 --> 00:52:43,656
Now get aside!
- Such ego?

362
00:52:45,328 --> 00:52:50,265
Why not? lf you have an ego,
so do l.

363
00:52:50,967 --> 00:52:52,935
You may be good-looking,
so all right.

364
00:52:53,203 --> 00:52:55,535
l have the looks
and the talents too.

365
00:52:56,206 --> 00:52:59,801
You may be a rich man, but
my parents are not beggars either!

366
00:53:01,144 --> 00:53:03,772
lf you think you can malign me,
then go ahead.

367
00:53:04,981 --> 00:53:08,473
l'll malign you?
How come?

368
00:53:09,219 --> 00:53:11,915
Remember that night when
l had come to you?

369
00:53:12,122 --> 00:53:15,421
Go and shout it from the roof-top!
You'll be at peace!

370
00:53:21,998 --> 00:53:27,800
This is your beauty? Too much of it
isn't good. lt increases the ego.

371
00:53:28,605 --> 00:53:33,565
You know the moon is beautiful...
that's why it has a scar...

372
00:53:34,344 --> 00:53:36,608
Let me scar your face too!

373
00:54:07,143 --> 00:54:10,271
Why did you do this?
- Don't be scared.

374
00:54:11,915 --> 00:54:15,874
These wounds will heal soon.
Only a scar will remain.

375
00:54:18,054 --> 00:54:21,319
lf somebody asks you about this,
make some excuse.

376
00:54:22,259 --> 00:54:24,853
Otherwise tell the truth.

377
00:54:26,196 --> 00:54:28,630
But Devdas...
- Nothing, Paro.

378
00:54:29,666 --> 00:54:34,330
l've just left a mark
to remind you.

379
00:54:35,572 --> 00:54:39,872
So that whenever you see this
lovely face in the mirror,...

380
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:42,100
you may remember me.

381
00:54:43,413 --> 00:54:46,849
This is perhaps the relationship
we have shared over many births.

382
00:54:49,019 --> 00:54:53,718
But you better forget it.
You know l'm very naive.

383
00:54:55,458 --> 00:55:00,589
l can never talk sensibly.
You did the right thing.

384
00:55:02,165 --> 00:55:04,463
You'd have never been
happy with me.

385
00:55:35,799 --> 00:55:39,200
Were you day-dreaming at the lake?
Oh my God!

386
00:55:40,070 --> 00:55:44,630
What's this?
-Holy Mother! You'll get married soon.

387
00:55:44,274 --> 00:55:47,732
How did this happen?
- lt's nothing, mother.

388
00:55:49,245 --> 00:55:52,900
l just slipped on those steps
and fell down.

389
00:56:01,324 --> 00:56:03,792
What's the matter, dear?
Why so sad?

390
00:56:04,461 --> 00:56:08,989
l've heard that you'll soon
marry a very rich landlord.

391
00:56:09,265 --> 00:56:15,898
Remember you had given us Rs 3/-,
and l had said you'd be a queen?

392
00:56:16,139 --> 00:56:19,666
l was right, wasn't l?
- Today you'll have to pay us well.

393
00:56:37,327 --> 00:56:42,856
''She now belongs to her beloved...''

394
00:56:44,801 --> 00:56:48,202
''Now the courtyard she grew up in
seems a strange land...''

395
00:56:48,471 --> 00:56:52,464
''for she now belongs
to her beloved''

396
00:57:01,217 --> 00:57:04,653
''The bylanes of her father's
village seem quiet...''

397
00:57:06,523 --> 00:57:12,180
''Even her childhood friends
don't interest her any more''

398
00:57:13,963 --> 00:57:17,194
''The dreams
dance in her eyes''

399
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:21,131
''And the mind is attracted
by ancient ties''

400
00:57:21,337 --> 00:57:26,206
''Every breath the beloved takes,
seems a message from him''

401
00:57:26,409 --> 00:57:30,106
''Now this courtyard
seems a strange land...''

402
00:57:30,313 --> 00:57:34,477
''For she now belongs
to her beloved''

403
00:57:48,631 --> 00:57:52,320
''Every moment the passion
is getting stronger...''

404
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:57,538
''Every fibre in this
delicate body is taut...''

405
00:57:59,576 --> 00:58:06,140
''l can read her mind well.
She's her beloved's now''

406
00:58:06,382 --> 00:58:15,188
''Life here seems a punishment.
- This courtyard seems strange too''

407
00:58:15,458 --> 00:58:22,864
''She now belongs to her beloved''

408
00:59:25,228 --> 00:59:30,970
l wish l could call Devdas
now and show him this beauty.

409
00:59:32,368 --> 00:59:38,864
Can't l just meet him once
and pay my respects to him?

410
00:59:40,476 --> 00:59:44,606
Forget him. l heard that
he has gone to Calcutta again.

411
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:12,337
So, you're back again, eh?

412
01:00:16,946 --> 01:00:18,675
When did you come?
- Yesterday.

413
01:00:18,915 --> 01:00:21,247
Then where were you
the whole day?

414
01:00:21,451 --> 01:00:24,284
And the night too.
- ln the park.

415
01:00:24,487 --> 01:00:28,184
Park?
Are you crazy? What's wrong?

416
01:00:28,524 --> 01:00:30,719
Fought with your father?
- No.

417
01:00:31,094 --> 01:00:33,392
Then maybe with somebody else?
- No...

418
01:00:34,797 --> 01:00:38,995
l forgot you were unmarried.
How can you have a fight.

419
01:00:46,676 --> 01:00:49,770
Do one's sorrows really
disappear where you go?

420
01:00:50,546 --> 01:00:53,370
They do...
But that place is bad.

421
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:57,850
Good or bad... it's all humbug!

422
01:00:58,588 --> 01:01:00,180
Take me with you please.

423
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:07,961
O you erring one...
you're bowled over, too.

424
01:01:09,532 --> 01:01:13,730
l don't mind taking you, but,
it'll be better if you don't go.

425
01:01:14,470 --> 01:01:19,237
l will go, l say.
- Okay. As you wish. Come.

426
01:01:25,648 --> 01:01:29,490
Get in your bridal-pallaquin, dear.

427
01:01:48,538 --> 01:01:51,803
What hell have you
brought me to? lt's repulsive.

428
01:03:03,579 --> 01:03:06,139
Who is he?
- A wet blanket!

429
01:03:09,685 --> 01:03:14,315
Why did you stop? ''You stopped,
and my heart stopped with you...''

430
01:03:14,524 --> 01:03:16,515
'' Because of this sad burden,
the sky has stooped too!''

431
01:03:16,726 --> 01:03:19,422
Where are you going?
Don't be scared.

432
01:03:21,664 --> 01:03:22,596
Sit down.

433
01:03:28,237 --> 01:03:29,864
Carry on, Master.

434
01:03:52,562 --> 01:03:56,328
''At my lover's feet...''

435
01:03:59,168 --> 01:04:08,201
''l place my heart, as a gift...''

436
01:04:12,281 --> 01:04:19,517
''He picked it up, and
the silly thing said...''

437
01:04:19,989 --> 01:04:20,956
''What?''

438
01:04:21,324 --> 01:04:26,159
''l leave it to you now...'

439
01:04:29,198 --> 01:04:31,928
''O dear beloved, my darling...
O cruel one,...''

440
01:04:32,201 --> 01:04:35,432
''l leave it to you now''

441
01:04:59,929 --> 01:05:05,231
''Don't ask me why these
fools are sitting here''

442
01:05:13,876 --> 01:05:18,609
''l've lost my heart
to your grace''

443
01:05:27,356 --> 01:05:32,487
''My lips show life;
and l pine''

444
01:05:32,929 --> 01:05:38,663
''There's hope in my eyes...
which l suppress''

445
01:05:39,268 --> 01:05:45,264
'' But l leave it to you now...''

446
01:05:45,474 --> 01:05:49,100
''O my beloved,... my darling
O heartless one...''

447
01:05:49,245 --> 01:05:51,577
''l leave it to you now...''

448
01:06:28,985 --> 01:06:31,100
Wonderful...!

449
01:06:36,993 --> 01:06:44,764
''Love is an emotional storm...''

450
01:06:45,801 --> 01:06:51,680
''There's a will to live''

451
01:06:51,841 --> 01:06:55,800
''And the desire to die too''

452
01:06:57,013 --> 01:06:58,810
'' But now...''

453
01:06:59,048 --> 01:07:02,170
''l leave it to you...''

454
01:07:04,787 --> 01:07:08,314
''O my beloved... my darling.
O cruel one''

455
01:07:08,524 --> 01:07:10,583
''The ball is in your court''

456
01:07:11,894 --> 01:07:20,666
''O heartless one,
l leave it to you, darling''

457
01:07:27,209 --> 01:07:29,575
Bless you!

458
01:07:35,785 --> 01:07:38,117
lf you say so.
Come on boys.

459
01:07:40,656 --> 01:07:42,283
Do we have to?
- Yes.

460
01:07:47,797 --> 01:07:50,129
Where are you going?
- Outside.

461
01:07:50,332 --> 01:07:52,664
Then come this way.
- lsn't there a door there?

462
01:07:52,868 --> 01:07:54,130
No.
- Okay then.

463
01:07:56,939 --> 01:07:59,635
Where are you going? Sit here
l'll just get some cigarettes.

464
01:08:30,406 --> 01:08:35,742
What a shameless girl.
You take money, don't you?

465
01:08:37,346 --> 01:08:41,646
When your feet grace...
- l'm talking about money!

466
01:08:42,251 --> 01:08:47,848
You charge money, don't you?
- Yes. But professionally...

467
01:08:48,090 --> 01:08:49,682
Enough!
l don't wish to hear more.

468
01:09:08,944 --> 01:09:16,146
Did Devdas go?
- See this... return it to him.

469
01:09:16,485 --> 01:09:20,785
Why should l? He gave it to you.
- He didn't give willingly.

470
01:09:21,757 --> 01:09:25,386
Because l charge money,
he got angry and gave me this.

471
01:09:29,131 --> 01:09:31,463
Will you do me a favour?
- Yes.

472
01:09:33,068 --> 01:09:37,266
Will you bring him here again?
- But he doesn't visit such places.

473
01:09:37,473 --> 01:09:41,239
And l don't think he ever will.
But why do you want him here?

474
01:09:43,479 --> 01:09:46,812
Just like that.
l wish to see him again.

475
01:09:50,319 --> 01:09:53,720
Fell in love while twirling, eh?
- You don't understand.

476
01:09:55,191 --> 01:09:59,252
He's the first man to have given
me money without any motive.

477
01:10:02,198 --> 01:10:04,928
Don't you understand?
- l do.

478
01:10:05,134 --> 01:10:08,690
You don't lust for money.

479
01:10:09,205 --> 01:10:12,936
But what's the real reason?
- What a question!

480
01:10:14,109 --> 01:10:17,567
l developed a soft-corner for him.
- ln 5 minutes flat?

481
01:10:21,116 --> 01:10:24,279
Forget that. Please bring him.
You will, won't you?

482
01:10:25,054 --> 01:10:27,386
Maybe.
- Swear on my head!

483
01:10:28,390 --> 01:10:31,325
lf that's how it is,
l'll try my best.

484
01:10:38,167 --> 01:10:42,103
You?
- Your mother has given this letter.

485
01:10:44,139 --> 01:10:47,870
You walked out without explaining
anything. She's crying ever since.

486
01:11:01,223 --> 01:11:05,455
Here, she has sent this money.
Come, come home with me.

487
01:11:08,130 --> 01:11:10,189
You go back.
l'm not going back.

488
01:11:10,899 --> 01:11:14,699
Come, my dear.
Take care of your new home now.

489
01:11:28,150 --> 01:11:31,745
Mother, l'm your
eldest son. Mahendra.

490
01:11:33,656 --> 01:11:36,887
Let me pay my respects,
as your eldest son.

491
01:11:40,296 --> 01:11:48,670
lt's 2 years now that my mom died.
Ever since we've faced hardships.

492
01:11:49,338 --> 01:11:54,571
Now that you've come, bless us
that we all lead a happy life.

493
01:11:56,078 --> 01:12:01,106
Where's your sister, Yashoda?
- With her in-laws.

494
01:12:01,350 --> 01:12:05,514
l had sent her a letter, but she...
... couldn't come.

495
01:12:06,155 --> 01:12:11,388
Couldn't come, or didn't come?
- l don't really know.

496
01:12:12,027 --> 01:12:16,521
But if father goes to get her...
- Why should he?

497
01:12:17,232 --> 01:12:19,132
How about you and l going?

498
01:12:19,335 --> 01:12:22,600
No. Why you?
l'll go myself to get her.

499
01:12:27,209 --> 01:12:32,408
No, l don't want to go!
- Don't say that. Why not meet her?

500
01:12:34,383 --> 01:12:36,408
Come in, my dear.

501
01:12:41,390 --> 01:12:47,260
Are you cross with your new mom?
- No. Why should l be?

502
01:12:55,137 --> 01:12:57,128
What's this?
- Nothing.

503
01:12:57,339 --> 01:12:59,273
Just your mother's necklace.

504
01:13:04,146 --> 01:13:09,448
This is your father's house.
Such a huge house needs servants.

505
01:13:09,651 --> 01:13:14,452
l'm also one of them, nothing else.

506
01:13:15,524 --> 01:13:20,257
ls it nice for you to
get angry at servants?

507
01:13:21,330 --> 01:13:25,460
l beg you, mom.
Please forgive me.

508
01:13:31,206 --> 01:13:32,867
So, how's our new mom?
- Nice.

509
01:13:33,409 --> 01:13:35,206
Shall l tell her
what all you said?

510
01:13:35,411 --> 01:13:38,608
No! l beg you.
Don't tell her anything.

511
01:13:52,194 --> 01:13:58,531
You've saved me from humiliation.
Won my children over too.

512
01:13:59,201 --> 01:14:05,663
Fixed our elder son's marriage too.
May God bless you. Be happy, dear.

513
01:14:06,108 --> 01:14:11,136
What are you saying?
- l wish l could explain better.

514
01:14:18,487 --> 01:14:22,116
l did wrong.
- What do you mean?

515
01:14:22,591 --> 01:14:24,320
What shall l say?

516
01:14:24,593 --> 01:14:30,540
l think you're a misfit here.
- Why do you say that?

517
01:14:30,466 --> 01:14:33,526
And what difference
does it make anyway?

518
01:14:53,555 --> 01:14:57,321
Why does he do this?
- Why? What happened?

519
01:14:57,526 --> 01:15:01,326
Can't you see how he paces up and
down like a mad man? What for, l say!

520
01:15:04,766 --> 01:15:09,533
One blind man is asking another
blind man. l really don't know.

521
01:15:13,408 --> 01:15:18,380
Has he fought with his parents?
- Nothing like that.

522
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:19,804
Then?

523
01:15:20,449 --> 01:15:25,853
l think this happened after
his childhood pal went away.

524
01:15:29,658 --> 01:15:31,819
Then we're very much alike.

525
01:15:34,463 --> 01:15:38,263
Then go and talk to him.
He doesn't listen to me at all.

526
01:15:38,467 --> 01:15:40,935
Convince him somehow,
Okay. l'll try some trick.

527
01:15:51,113 --> 01:15:56,210
What's wrong? What happened?
- Nothing.

528
01:15:56,451 --> 01:16:00,785
Tell me.
- There's nothing to tell.

529
01:16:04,226 --> 01:16:09,391
Do one thing, come with me.
- Where?

530
01:16:09,665 --> 01:16:11,929
Where we went that day.

531
01:16:16,505 --> 01:16:20,407
l don't like it.
- Okay.

532
01:16:20,609 --> 01:16:23,373
Are you going there?
- Yes.

533
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:26,273
l won't, if you say so.
- No, l won't stop you.

534
01:16:27,382 --> 01:16:30,909
But what hopes do you carry?
What do you get there?

535
01:16:32,521 --> 01:16:36,150
l get nothing.
l go there to pass my time.

536
01:16:37,726 --> 01:16:42,600
And time really passes?
Mine seems to drag.

537
01:16:42,731 --> 01:16:43,891
Then come with me. l'll see that
your time not just passes, but runs!

538
01:17:30,145 --> 01:17:33,842
''My dear guest,
wait for some time''

539
01:17:34,549 --> 01:17:37,950
''lt's very difficult out there
with countless woes''

540
01:18:02,544 --> 01:18:10,679
''Come, let me hide you in my eyes;
And hide you in my colourful shawl''

541
01:18:21,663 --> 01:18:29,399
''And offer my heart to you
O shy one...''

542
01:18:29,871 --> 01:18:34,399
''O shy one, wait here
for some time''

543
01:18:34,609 --> 01:18:38,238
lt's difficult out there
''with countless woes''

544
01:19:14,316 --> 01:19:22,451
''There's magic in the air, and,
my hair is smelling so sweetly''

545
01:19:33,602 --> 01:19:40,804
''Listen to what your heart is saying
Oh l say! O cruel one...''

546
01:19:41,676 --> 01:19:45,544
''O heartless one,
wait for some time''

547
01:19:46,047 --> 01:19:49,813
''lt's very difficult out there
with countless woes''

548
01:20:08,303 --> 01:20:16,301
''Get lost in the tinkle of my
anklets and in the world of dreams''

549
01:20:27,656 --> 01:20:34,926
''Stay on here as my guest,
my honoured guest, O cruel one''

550
01:20:35,730 --> 01:20:39,598
''O, cruel one,
wait for some time.

551
01:20:40,001 --> 01:20:43,937
lt's difficult out there
with countless woes''

552
01:21:55,076 --> 01:22:01,413
l'm sorry but it's my duty to tell
the truth. Your father's critical.

553
01:22:01,917 --> 01:22:07,355
Carry on with the medicines l gave.
Rest, leave it to heaven.

554
01:22:13,194 --> 01:22:19,793
Don't waste time. lnform Devdas.
- How? l must have his address.

555
01:22:20,068 --> 01:22:23,595
Then go and get him.
- Don't be silly!

556
01:22:23,805 --> 01:22:25,739
How can l leave father?

557
01:22:25,941 --> 01:22:28,967
We'll wire Dharamdas there.
He find him and bring him home.

558
01:23:14,122 --> 01:23:17,285
Enough.
- Why?

559
01:23:18,827 --> 01:23:23,787
You've just taken to alcohol.
You may not endure it.

560
01:23:24,132 --> 01:23:28,466
Which fool drinks
to be able to endure?

561
01:23:31,906 --> 01:23:36,468
l drink to be able to breathe
and since l don't have the guts...

562
01:23:37,946 --> 01:23:49,118
to get up and go from here,
l loll around. That's all.

563
01:23:50,792 --> 01:23:58,426
l just keep looking at your face.
Even then l'm not completely out...

564
01:24:01,736 --> 01:24:03,203
l'm in my senses a little bit.

565
01:24:05,774 --> 01:24:11,269
Tell consciousness
never to be conscious.

566
01:24:14,049 --> 01:24:19,282
Some people who come here,
don't even touch alcohol.

567
01:24:20,655 --> 01:24:22,880
Really?

568
01:24:25,593 --> 01:24:34,331
lf l had a gun, l'd shoot them.
They're bigger sinners than me.

569
01:24:37,806 --> 01:24:45,872
Firstly, l'll not stop drinking, and
if l do, l'll never come here. Never!

570
01:24:53,054 --> 01:25:00,654
There's a solution for my
problem. But what about them...

571
01:25:00,862 --> 01:25:05,526
who don't touch liquor,
but still come here?

572
01:25:08,069 --> 01:25:14,133
l'm so sorry that
l took to drinking.

573
01:25:23,118 --> 01:25:31,856
Don't touch me!
l'm still conscious, you know.

574
01:25:34,095 --> 01:25:41,661
You don't know, how l hate your sort.
And l always will. But even then...

575
01:25:44,139 --> 01:25:51,375
l'll come to you, sit with you,
and chat. No other way out, is there?

576
01:25:58,019 --> 01:26:00,180
Will your lot ever understand this?

577
01:26:05,193 --> 01:26:12,759
People sin in the dark, and l come
here during the day, and get sozzled!

578
01:26:16,871 --> 01:26:23,709
You are a living example
of endurance.

579
01:26:28,883 --> 01:26:35,584
You say you love me...
But l don't want it.

580
01:26:38,092 --> 01:26:44,793
l really don't. No!
People indulge in dramatics.

581
01:26:46,201 --> 01:26:52,868
They do make up and become
kings and queens...

582
01:26:55,009 --> 01:26:59,275
They love, or rather pretend to.
And it all seems real.

583
01:27:06,187 --> 01:27:11,784
You're no different,
you act too and l watch.

584
01:27:19,934 --> 01:27:22,528
Even then, l remember Paro,
so very much!

585
01:27:30,211 --> 01:27:39,279
Everything got over in a moment.
She chose the path of matrimony...

586
01:27:40,955 --> 01:27:50,330
and l, of destruction!
And a never-ending drama began!

587
01:27:55,903 --> 01:27:58,337
Who is it? Parvati?

588
01:28:05,346 --> 01:28:10,790
You're not Paro,
so why do you cry?

589
01:28:17,892 --> 01:28:24,889
One small mistake, and such
a severe punishment for it?

590
01:28:29,137 --> 01:28:32,334
Why does her memory
haunt me like this?

591
01:28:35,410 --> 01:28:37,742
Why can't l forget her?

592
01:28:44,385 --> 01:28:48,549
Come... go and sleep now.
- Sleep?

593
01:28:50,458 --> 01:28:55,657
l'm an alcoholic, and,
she, a...

594
01:28:58,466 --> 01:29:07,340
Okay, so be it. Nothing wrong.
No hopes, no trust.

595
01:29:08,409 --> 01:29:14,746
No happiness, nor any desire.
Wonderful!

596
01:29:48,216 --> 01:29:51,117
ls Devdas here?
- Yes, but he's sleeping.

597
01:29:51,319 --> 01:29:53,810
You can't meet him now.
- Why not?

598
01:29:54,055 --> 01:29:57,115
l'll meet him alright.
Where have you hidden him?

599
01:29:57,358 --> 01:29:59,724
l won't let him stay in this hell.
- Who is it?

600
01:30:06,401 --> 01:30:09,290
Dharamdas? What are you doing here?
- Your friend...

601
01:30:09,237 --> 01:30:13,537
Why are you here?
Get out of here!

602
01:30:14,409 --> 01:30:16,707
l won't go with you.
- Wait!

603
01:30:20,314 --> 01:30:26,617
l got a telegram. Master's no more.
He left us all, and passed on.

604
01:30:29,290 --> 01:30:34,523
Come home now. lf not for
anyone, for your mother atleast.

605
01:30:46,474 --> 01:30:50,535
l don't want to live either.
What's the point in living?

606
01:31:11,599 --> 01:31:15,262
Paro! What a surprise!
No letter or a message even.

607
01:31:15,470 --> 01:31:20,237
l got Manudidi's letter saying
Devdas's father was serious...

608
01:31:20,441 --> 01:31:22,739
He's no more, my dear.
- Dead?

609
01:31:25,480 --> 01:31:27,539
l'll go there and come.

610
01:32:01,449 --> 01:32:03,883
When did you come?
- Today.

611
01:32:05,786 --> 01:32:10,587
An age has passed since l met you.
You're well, aren't you?

612
01:32:12,527 --> 01:32:14,927
Your husband and the kids,...
are they well too?

613
01:32:15,563 --> 01:32:18,880
All are fine.

614
01:32:19,667 --> 01:32:21,897
You'll be here for a few days,
l suppose.

615
01:32:25,673 --> 01:32:28,107
Okay then.
l'll see you later.

616
01:32:43,491 --> 01:32:47,325
Parvati, you've come? Good!
You may be able to save Devdas.

617
01:32:47,595 --> 01:32:50,587
Why? What's happened?
- l wish l could tell you.

618
01:32:50,831 --> 01:32:54,460
Master's gone and Devdas
has access to all the money.

619
01:32:54,669 --> 01:32:58,469
lt'll be very difficult now.
- What'll be difficult? Tell me.

620
01:32:58,673 --> 01:33:04,339
What do l tell you?
He neither eats, nor sleeps.

621
01:33:04,579 --> 01:33:08,538
Just drinks bottles of liquor
and disappears for 3-4 days.

622
01:33:08,783 --> 01:33:11,479
And l hear that he's got
some ornaments made too.

623
01:33:11,886 --> 01:33:13,148
For whom?

624
01:33:19,827 --> 01:33:21,590
How much cash did father leave.
- 1 .5 lakhs.

625
01:33:22,797 --> 01:33:28,463
How much will l get?
- Half of it. And half for me.

626
01:33:28,669 --> 01:33:31,604
And mother?
- Why does she need the cash?

627
01:33:31,806 --> 01:33:34,741
She's the mistress of the house.
We've to take care of her.

628
01:33:34,942 --> 01:33:37,467
l've come to this conclusion...

629
01:33:37,678 --> 01:33:41,375
that we needn't spend more than
10,000 for father's rites.

630
01:33:41,816 --> 01:33:48,850
lt'll be the last expenditure on him.
Mom wishes to give food and alms.

631
01:33:48,789 --> 01:33:52,885
That should cost about 30,000/-.
- What!

632
01:33:53,127 --> 01:33:58,997
Yes. Take 25,000/- from my share
and you contribute 5,000/-.

633
01:33:59,867 --> 01:34:05,320
The rest of the 50,000/- can be
divided between mother and myself.

634
01:34:05,740 --> 01:34:10,734
What do you think?
- Okay. You know l'm a family man...

635
01:34:10,945 --> 01:34:13,880
with many responsibilities.
Then, shall we make it legal?

636
01:34:14,081 --> 01:34:19,747
ls it necessary? l don't like it.
- But if later on, if there's...

637
01:34:19,954 --> 01:34:21,683
Okay, then get it done.

638
01:34:54,889 --> 01:34:57,255
Now suppose l malign you?

639
01:35:02,863 --> 01:35:11,271
Feeling shy, eh? But why feel shy?
We were both childish...

640
01:35:12,873 --> 01:35:19,608
And see what happened in between.
You let your tongue wag in anger...

641
01:35:21,816 --> 01:35:24,284
And l also gave you that
scar on your forehead!

642
01:35:25,019 --> 01:35:30,457
This scar is my joy and wealth.
My sole shelter.

643
01:35:33,561 --> 01:35:35,392
Why don't you say something?

644
01:35:37,932 --> 01:35:46,738
l get very angry with you at times.
Father's dead. lt's so painful.

645
01:35:47,942 --> 01:35:50,274
Had you been here,
would this pain be still there?

646
01:35:52,847 --> 01:35:56,749
You know my sis-in-law, and,
my brother's nature too.

647
01:35:58,786 --> 01:36:01,254
Where will l go with my mother?

648
01:36:05,059 --> 01:36:10,554
And then, l don't know what's
going to happen to me, either.

649
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:15,997
lf you had been here,
l'd have left it to you and relaxed.

650
01:36:16,871 --> 01:36:19,499
What's this, you're crying?

651
01:36:21,942 --> 01:36:24,100
Never mind. Let's stop
this topic here.

652
01:36:25,846 --> 01:36:27,814
No, keep talking.

653
01:36:29,216 --> 01:36:35,180
l hear you've become a typical
housewife. A big house, big estate.

654
01:36:44,131 --> 01:36:46,326
Will you do me a favour?

655
01:36:49,003 --> 01:36:50,610
Yes?

656
01:36:51,005 --> 01:36:57,171
Will l get a girl from your town?
Feel like settling down.

657
01:36:57,878 --> 01:37:04,780
A beautiful girl, right?
- Yes. Just like you.

658
01:37:05,085 --> 01:37:10,790
Good natured?
- No, wicked.

659
01:37:10,925 --> 01:37:13,155
One who'll fight with me,
like you.

660
01:37:13,928 --> 01:37:21,610
Thousands like me will fall at your
feet and think themselves lucky.

661
01:37:22,002 --> 01:37:24,610
l don't want thousands.
Just one will do.

662
01:37:30,945 --> 01:37:33,277
May l ask you something?
- Yes.

663
01:37:36,150 --> 01:37:38,675
When did you start to drink?

664
01:37:40,020 --> 01:37:42,818
Who told you?
- Anybody.

665
01:37:44,058 --> 01:37:47,391
ls it true?
- Yes.

666
01:37:50,331 --> 01:37:51,525
lt's true.

667
01:38:00,841 --> 01:38:04,208
You've made ornaments worth
thousands to give her.

668
01:38:06,013 --> 01:38:10,279
l've just got them made.
Not given. Do you want them?

669
01:38:10,951 --> 01:38:15,547
Yes, give them to me.
Look, l've nothing on me.

670
01:38:16,891 --> 01:38:22,352
Didn't your husband give you any?
- He had, but l gave them...

671
01:38:22,596 --> 01:38:24,427
to his daughter.

672
01:38:28,202 --> 01:38:30,397
l don't think you need ornaments.

673
01:38:37,645 --> 01:38:42,639
And what you heard is a lie.
l don't love any woman.

674
01:38:51,058 --> 01:38:54,960
Promise me one thing.
That you'll never drink liquor.

675
01:38:57,197 --> 01:39:00,689
That's impossible.
- Why?

676
01:39:00,935 --> 01:39:03,802
Will you promise
not to remember me?

677
01:39:08,909 --> 01:39:11,810
l've some work downstairs.
l'll go now.

678
01:39:12,012 --> 01:39:13,138
No!

679
01:39:14,715 --> 01:39:18,151
First promise me.
- No.

680
01:39:18,519 --> 01:39:22,460
Why not?
- Does everybody do everything?

681
01:39:22,289 --> 01:39:24,621
Where there's a will,
there's a way.

682
01:39:25,326 --> 01:39:28,193
Then can you elope
with me tonight?

683
01:39:36,971 --> 01:39:40,600
lt's evening. Go home, Paro.
- Promise me.

684
01:39:42,042 --> 01:39:48,504
lt's not nice to force somebody.
l may not keep my word.

685
01:39:50,150 --> 01:39:51,617
Open the door.

686
01:39:55,522 --> 01:39:57,217
l'm suffocating, Devdas.

687
01:39:59,259 --> 01:40:02,990
Don't l know it?
- l'm dying within because...

688
01:40:03,197 --> 01:40:07,990
l could not serve you.
Come to my place.

689
01:40:07,368 --> 01:40:09,928
There's nobody here
to take care of you.

690
01:40:10,137 --> 01:40:11,934
Come to your place?

691
01:40:13,273 --> 01:40:18,267
You'll take care of me?
- That's my life's ambition.

692
01:40:19,013 --> 01:40:20,674
Help me fulfill it.

693
01:40:21,348 --> 01:40:28,277
After that, even if l die,
l don't care. Come with me.

694
01:40:29,023 --> 01:40:34,962
Maybe...
- Touch me. Swear upon me.

695
01:40:35,195 --> 01:40:41,395
l'll never forget this. lf you're
happy to serve me, l'll come.

696
01:40:43,137 --> 01:40:44,729
l'll definitely come.

697
01:41:04,525 --> 01:41:07,926
Welcome my dear...
The wealth of my house.

698
01:41:21,408 --> 01:41:25,300
The beggars are making a lot
of fuss for not getting clothes.

699
01:41:25,279 --> 01:41:28,737
Why didn't they get? They should
get too, with everybody else.

700
01:41:28,982 --> 01:41:31,917
Tell the Munim, he'll see to it.
- Okay.

701
01:41:36,457 --> 01:41:39,858
Silence. My mother said
everybody will get clothes.

702
01:41:40,060 --> 01:41:43,393
Long live our Mistress.

703
01:41:58,512 --> 01:42:03,400
Listen, does Chandramukhi...
- Yes, come in.

704
01:42:13,026 --> 01:42:17,395
Why is this room like this?
And where's Chandramukhi?

705
01:42:22,669 --> 01:42:23,727
You?

706
01:42:27,207 --> 01:42:30,404
What happened to you?
- Happened?

707
01:42:31,378 --> 01:42:33,869
l think something
good happened to me.

708
01:42:36,316 --> 01:42:38,113
Have you forgotten me so soon?

709
01:42:41,321 --> 01:42:47,726
You look thin. Were you ill?
- Not physically.

710
01:42:49,296 --> 01:42:55,462
No ornaments on your body...
The house is vacant. How come?

711
01:42:56,270 --> 01:42:57,862
l sold everything.

712
01:42:59,973 --> 01:43:01,907
And what about the instruments,
and musicians?

713
01:43:03,277 --> 01:43:05,600
l've left all that.

714
01:43:07,314 --> 01:43:09,908
This hall of yours
has completely changed.

715
01:43:11,385 --> 01:43:17,187
Not just the hall, but
the inner-rooms too. Come.

716
01:43:42,382 --> 01:43:47,183
Doesn't my old friend come now?
- No. He had come 2 months ago.

717
01:43:47,387 --> 01:43:51,255
He fought with me and went.
He has taken a job somewhere.

718
01:43:51,458 --> 01:43:53,187
What was the fight about?

719
01:43:54,595 --> 01:43:58,870
He had come to sell.
But l showed him the door.

720
01:43:59,733 --> 01:44:04,568
Sell what?
- Wheat!

721
01:44:06,540 --> 01:44:10,738
You really are too straight.
He had got a big fish for me!

722
01:44:11,445 --> 01:44:16,644
Rs.500 a month. Plus jewellery.
Two body-guards at the door.

723
01:44:17,384 --> 01:44:20,182
But where is all that?
l can't see anybody.

724
01:44:20,387 --> 01:44:23,379
You would, had they stayed.
l shooed out every one of them.

725
01:44:23,590 --> 01:44:27,686
Their crime?
- None. l just didn't like it all.

726
01:44:29,062 --> 01:44:31,189
Nobody's been here
since you went away.

727
01:44:32,466 --> 01:44:37,529
So you've shut shutters, eh?
- Yes, since insolvency crept in.

728
01:44:38,472 --> 01:44:43,136
How will you pull along now?
- l can't afford the city life...

729
01:44:43,410 --> 01:44:45,776
so l thought l'd go to
a cheaper place.

730
01:44:46,046 --> 01:44:48,207
Why didn't you?

731
01:44:48,715 --> 01:44:54,119
l just hoped to see you again.
l knew you'd come one day.

732
01:44:54,354 --> 01:44:57,812
Just to see me? Why?

733
01:45:01,395 --> 01:45:03,522
Because you hated me so much.

734
01:45:04,464 --> 01:45:12,530
Nobody had ever hated me like you.
So many men had come and gone.

735
01:45:14,374 --> 01:45:22,543
But none had the spark l saw
in you. You cast a spell on me.

736
01:45:23,216 --> 01:45:29,246
From then on l changed drastically.
l saw everything differently.

737
01:45:32,459 --> 01:45:37,863
Then you began to hit the bottle.
l simply hate alcohol.

738
01:45:39,399 --> 01:45:42,732
When somebody gets drunk and
misbehaves, l get angry.

739
01:45:45,505 --> 01:45:49,999
But when you did the same,
l used to cry.

740
01:45:52,713 --> 01:46:00,552
Once you said l endured much,
that day l found my self-esteem.

741
01:46:01,655 --> 01:46:03,589
And l left everything.

742
01:46:06,460 --> 01:46:11,796
True, but then women are fickle.

743
01:46:17,671 --> 01:46:25,806
Has Parvati hurt you so much?
- Why do you ask?

744
01:46:27,514 --> 01:46:35,649
Because l've done business of love
for years, but l've loved only one.

745
01:46:37,424 --> 01:46:40,882
Loving is one thing, and
physical attraction is another.

746
01:46:42,529 --> 01:46:46,795
Men fall easily for physical
attraction. We women don't.

747
01:46:48,535 --> 01:46:53,666
You express love.
Make noise about it.

748
01:46:54,541 --> 01:46:59,740
Even then we keep quiet and
accept this new way of life.

749
01:47:00,514 --> 01:47:03,881
But even at that time,
we don't know what is love.

750
01:47:05,585 --> 01:47:13,651
Later when at some odd moment we
give vent to our inner conflict...

751
01:47:14,461 --> 01:47:19,831
you men hit the roof, and call
us ''Characterless'', ''traitors''...

752
01:47:25,739 --> 01:47:30,267
Don't be scared.
l don't mean your Parvati.

753
01:47:32,546 --> 01:47:38,485
Maybe she's more beautiful.
But l still know this, that...

754
01:47:38,785 --> 01:47:44,849
she must've fallen in love first,
and even expressed it to you first.

755
01:47:46,493 --> 01:47:50,896
l've come to know from myself,
how much she loves you.

756
01:47:52,966 --> 01:47:58,404
What?
- l'm not talking about myself,...

757
01:47:58,605 --> 01:48:01,233
but speaking on her behalf.

758
01:48:03,977 --> 01:48:10,382
What could be more tragic, than
one who's not loved by the man...

759
01:48:10,650 --> 01:48:13,710
sits and narrates the
love-story forcibly.

760
01:48:17,791 --> 01:48:20,726
l better go now.
- Sit a while.

761
01:48:23,497 --> 01:48:28,799
l've never seen you sober, or
ever spoken to you like this.

762
01:48:30,637 --> 01:48:39,450
Before this you never saw my face
till you were completely sozzled.

763
01:48:40,680 --> 01:48:45,845
This year atleast l won't touch
liquor. l lost my father, remember.

764
01:48:48,455 --> 01:48:53,358
Will you drink again?
- Can't say.

765
01:48:54,594 --> 01:48:56,391
Leave it forever, if you can.

766
01:48:57,130 --> 01:48:59,462
Don't spoil your life.

767
01:49:10,710 --> 01:49:12,750
l'll go now.

768
01:49:16,683 --> 01:49:18,344
Bless me happiness.

769
01:49:27,928 --> 01:49:34,595
Wherever you go, keep in touch.
And don't feel awkward to ask help.

770
01:50:02,829 --> 01:50:04,922
Hope you're well.
- Yes.

771
01:50:05,999 --> 01:50:08,399
l feel happy meeting you all.

772
01:50:11,805 --> 01:50:12,863
Be happy.

773
01:50:30,757 --> 01:50:34,124
Ever since you left,
the village isn't the same.

774
01:50:34,461 --> 01:50:42,610
Devdas does come here, but only to
fight with his brother and for money.

775
01:50:42,702 --> 01:50:47,639
He takes money from here and spends
it there. His father died 2 years ago.

776
01:50:47,874 --> 01:50:52,937
And within this period he has blown
50% of the cash. l think...

777
01:50:53,179 --> 01:50:57,980
Thank God you didn't marry him.
He's here at the moment.

778
01:50:58,451 --> 01:51:01,511
And shoots birds the whole day.

779
01:51:01,721 --> 01:51:02,813
When his head throbs due to the sun,
he sits under a tree and thinks.

780
01:51:07,727 --> 01:51:09,319
Like a forlorn lover.

781
01:51:09,863 --> 01:51:16,928
''O beloved...
Dear beloved''

782
01:51:56,076 --> 01:52:05,951
''What kind of inextinguishable
fire am l experiencing?''

783
01:52:06,920 --> 01:52:16,989
''O dear darling beloved''

784
01:53:10,383 --> 01:53:22,727
''With a yearning in the heart
and with forlorn eyes...''

785
01:53:26,833 --> 01:53:40,760
''Only the tears remain
and my night is spoilt''

786
01:54:02,135 --> 01:54:07,720
''O dear beloved...''

787
01:54:37,103 --> 01:54:41,500
Get my litter ready.
l'll go to my mother's place today.

788
01:54:41,207 --> 01:54:44,870
But father's out of town. We also
have religious rites tomorrow.

789
01:54:45,111 --> 01:54:49,673
Don't argue. l know everything.
Just do as l say. l must go.

790
01:54:49,916 --> 01:54:50,848
Okay.

791
01:54:57,123 --> 01:54:58,590
Hurry up men.

792
01:55:25,118 --> 01:55:29,452
Where's Devdas?
- l tried my best, but in vain.

793
01:55:30,123 --> 01:55:32,387
And he left for Calcutta by
the morning train.

794
01:55:33,259 --> 01:55:34,658
He's gone?

795
01:55:50,944 --> 01:55:55,210
Did you go to the post office?
- Yes, but there's no mail.

796
01:55:58,318 --> 01:56:05,588
lt's been 3 months now.
He hasn't written, nor replied mine.

797
01:56:26,112 --> 01:56:28,979
How far is the house of the
Landlord of Talsonapur from here?

798
01:56:29,182 --> 01:56:36,247
About 2 miles. He himself is
dead but his 2 sons are there.

799
01:56:38,191 --> 01:56:41,649
Can you take me there?
- Why not? Whenever you say so.

800
01:56:42,195 --> 01:56:46,630
Not whenever, but now! Get ready.
- Okay, Ma'am.

801
01:57:01,881 --> 01:57:14,260
''There is cool shade at one place
and hot sun in another''

802
01:57:19,098 --> 01:57:27,267
''This is one face of it.
And so is that one''

803
01:57:39,252 --> 01:57:45,316
''Some will lose here.
And some will gain too''

804
01:57:59,205 --> 01:58:11,310
''Travellers, some will go...
and some will come''

805
01:59:01,134 --> 01:59:02,328
Why didn't you come that day?

806
01:59:02,535 --> 01:59:06,620
My baby's sick.
- As usual!

807
01:59:06,272 --> 01:59:09,764
But who'll do the work here?
Better not take any more leave.

808
01:59:14,247 --> 01:59:17,842
Greetings.
- Who are you?

809
01:59:20,520 --> 01:59:24,616
One of your subjects.
l've brought the rent.

810
01:59:24,991 --> 01:59:29,394
Sit down. Where do you live?
- On one of your estates.

811
01:59:31,464 --> 01:59:38,597
The ownership is shared, isn't it?
- Yes, but we'll be sole owners soon.

812
01:59:39,038 --> 01:59:43,338
The younger one lost his share in
drinks and womanising.

813
01:59:43,609 --> 01:59:45,941
God knows how much money he
has squandered!

814
01:59:48,247 --> 01:59:52,470
Doesn't he ever come here?
- He was here recently.

815
01:59:52,251 --> 01:59:56,585
Fought with his elder brother,
took some money, and went away.

816
01:59:57,390 --> 02:00:01,530
When will he come again?
- l doubt if he'll come.

817
02:00:01,260 --> 02:00:06,270
He's always sick, and now
he may not live for long.

818
02:00:07,366 --> 02:00:11,735
Where does he stay in Calcutta?
- Who knows? He eats in a hotel...

819
02:00:11,938 --> 02:00:15,704
and sleeps here and there.
lt's his problem, not ours!

820
02:00:17,310 --> 02:00:21,474
Okay then, l'll go now.
- Take her to the office.

821
02:00:21,747 --> 02:00:23,715
Don't bother, l'll go myself.

822
02:00:32,592 --> 02:00:35,527
l wanted to ask you something
for quite some time.

823
02:00:36,095 --> 02:00:37,187
Yes?

824
02:00:37,396 --> 02:00:44,928
You have such lovely saris, so
why do you wear these simple ones?

825
02:00:45,404 --> 02:00:48,202
Just like that.
- And that jewellery?

826
02:00:48,407 --> 02:00:52,360
Who is it for after all?
- l gave them to Yashoda.

827
02:00:52,345 --> 02:00:56,577
Good. But l had got new ones
made for you.

828
02:00:56,782 --> 02:01:01,820
Even then you live like an ascetic!
- Not at all.

829
02:01:01,354 --> 02:01:07,782
You live simply. So do l.
- Never mind me. l'm old.

830
02:01:08,461 --> 02:01:12,192
But you're not.
Wear some pieces of jewellery.

831
02:01:12,398 --> 02:01:14,127
l don't like them.

832
02:01:25,645 --> 02:01:30,480
Who is it? Chameli?
Come in, and shut the door.

833
02:01:38,524 --> 02:01:43,791
My, my! Such beauty?
lt'll all be electric tonight.

834
02:01:44,397 --> 02:01:50,165
What is it? You just got up and
left one day. And you're back again?

835
02:01:51,504 --> 02:01:55,873
l'm going to seek my groom!
- Groom? What do you mean?

836
02:01:56,809 --> 02:02:00,176
You'll know when he comes.
- l see.

837
02:02:02,648 --> 02:02:05,776
l think it's him.
l better go.

838
02:02:17,496 --> 02:02:20,590
Here l am.
- Who are you?

839
02:02:23,669 --> 02:02:27,605
Hey, you're somebody else.
But you're too good also.

840
02:02:27,807 --> 02:02:29,331
You're also nice.
- Get out!

841
02:02:29,542 --> 02:02:31,601
What did you say?
- l said, out!

842
02:02:31,844 --> 02:02:38,875
Out, eh? There! Now may l ask
why l'm being thrown out?

843
02:02:39,118 --> 02:02:44,647
l mean, what for? Why?
Even then you're too good!

844
02:02:50,563 --> 02:02:54,294
Does a man called Devdas
come here?

845
02:02:54,500 --> 02:02:56,400
Who is he?

846
02:02:56,736 --> 02:03:01,400
Fair, with thick brows and
bright eyes. A big shot.

847
02:03:01,674 --> 02:03:06,737
He gives away lots of money too.
- No. l'm not so lucky.

848
02:03:38,577 --> 02:03:40,340
Stop! Stop driver.

849
02:04:45,845 --> 02:04:48,780
Why are you in this gutter?
Come home.

850
02:04:48,981 --> 02:04:56,786
Heart broken people like me...
Who cares whether we live or die?

851
02:05:07,800 --> 02:05:14,399
Today l left your company.
Tomorrow l'll leave this world!

852
02:05:27,853 --> 02:05:31,789
Do you want liquor?
- Yes. Where will l get it?

853
02:05:32,324 --> 02:05:38,580
Come. l'll get it for you.
- Where did you come from darling?

854
02:05:39,598 --> 02:05:47,801
Wow! So beautiful.
- Yes. But come now.

855
02:05:55,781 --> 02:06:01,140
You know me, beautiful?
- Yes l do. Now come along.

856
02:06:12,665 --> 02:06:16,931
Where have you brought me?
Anyway, get me some liquor.

857
02:06:18,003 --> 02:06:20,403
No liquor.
- What!

858
02:06:20,606 --> 02:06:22,597
Then why did you bring me here?

859
02:06:23,375 --> 02:06:28,472
Lied to me, eh?
Go get it somehow.

860
02:06:28,781 --> 02:06:34,480
You shouldn't drink.
- Who are you to lecture me?

861
02:06:35,487 --> 02:06:40,288
Go and get, else l'll leave.
- Don't go. You're not well.

862
02:06:40,492 --> 02:06:47,591
l'll die or go to hell.
How are you concerned? Not well...

863
02:06:48,067 --> 02:06:50,865
Sit down. l'll order it for you.

864
02:06:51,804 --> 02:06:54,534
Till then see my dance.
- Dance?

865
02:07:57,002 --> 02:08:03,271
''Where will l get the status
which you'll accept''

866
02:08:03,676 --> 02:08:09,876
''Where will l get the charm from
which will attract you?''

867
02:08:32,538 --> 02:08:38,477
''l'm that flower which has been
squashed by everyone''

868
02:08:38,911 --> 02:08:44,645
''And my youth has gone...
washed away in my tears''

869
02:08:45,050 --> 02:08:51,216
''Where will l get that cloud
which will shower flowers?''

870
02:08:51,790 --> 02:08:57,990
''Where will l get the status
which will attract you?''

871
02:09:29,828 --> 02:09:35,494
''You pine for somebody else
and l yearn for you''

872
02:09:36,001 --> 02:09:41,803
''There's only sorrow in your heart,
but in mine, there's just you''

873
02:09:42,107 --> 02:09:48,307
''Where will l get the balm
which will soothe our hearts?''

874
02:09:48,881 --> 02:09:55,470
''Where will l get that 'forever'
which will attract you?''

875
02:10:34,760 --> 02:10:40,596
''My helplessness is obvious,
by my sighs''

876
02:10:40,999 --> 02:10:46,801
''Even having asked for death,
l couldn't die because l was scared''

877
02:10:47,206 --> 02:10:53,236
''Where will l get the prayers
to fullfil your wishes?''

878
02:10:54,079 --> 02:10:59,847
''Where do l get the forever
which will attract you?''

879
02:12:03,048 --> 02:12:09,351
Where did you steal me from?
- l picked you off the road!

880
02:12:10,989 --> 02:12:17,952
And what's this? Bedecked with
ornaments like a new bride.

881
02:12:20,132 --> 02:12:22,794
Who gave them to you?
- Again?

882
02:12:25,170 --> 02:12:27,195
l was just joking.

883
02:12:28,006 --> 02:12:30,804
They weren't a gift nor were they
made to order. They're artificial.

884
02:12:31,276 --> 02:12:36,646
l've been here over a month for you.
l found this house. Paid the rent.

885
02:12:36,848 --> 02:12:41,444
And bought these ornaments.
l had to spend a lot for nothing!

886
02:12:42,321 --> 02:12:45,654
And look at you!
You couldn't even recognise me.

887
02:12:47,059 --> 02:12:51,257
Maybe, but it did cross my mind,
after l heard your voice.

888
02:12:52,331 --> 02:12:59,533
And kept on thinking who else can
serve me except my Chandramukhi?

889
02:13:06,311 --> 02:13:14,446
Do you hate me just as much even now?
- No. l love you.

890
02:13:26,098 --> 02:13:30,865
''My Chandramukhi'' !
Dear Lord...

891
02:13:36,008 --> 02:13:45,576
''My heart sings with joy''

892
02:13:50,188 --> 02:13:56,320
''My beloved is home''

893
02:14:06,738 --> 02:14:11,266
What happened? What's wrong?
lt's not total ruin, is it?

894
02:14:12,377 --> 02:14:15,938
There's no chest pain, is there?
- l don't know.

895
02:14:16,248 --> 02:14:18,443
Please lie down.

896
02:14:23,188 --> 02:14:24,780
l'll go and get a doctor.

897
02:14:29,394 --> 02:14:34,559
l think you're recovering.
- Because of your medicines.

898
02:14:35,133 --> 02:14:38,591
No. Because of her prayers,
and selfless nursing.

899
02:14:39,404 --> 02:14:44,341
But don't think you're 100% fit.
You must take care of your health.

900
02:14:45,010 --> 02:14:50,573
Liquor is poison for you.
Go out of town for a few days.

901
02:14:59,324 --> 02:15:02,316
Doctor said you should
go out of town.

902
02:15:06,398 --> 02:15:12,667
Why do you look after me like this?
- Don't you know why even now?

903
02:15:14,439 --> 02:15:20,844
l do, but what's the point?
See how l adore Parvati...

904
02:15:22,047 --> 02:15:26,381
and she too loved me so much!
But the society didn't accept.

905
02:15:28,053 --> 02:15:33,889
And what did we get except sorrow?
After this experience...

906
02:15:34,126 --> 02:15:38,927
l had vowed never to get trapped.
And it wasn't my doing either.

907
02:15:39,131 --> 02:15:43,397
Why did you do this?
Why did you develop these ties?

908
02:15:44,669 --> 02:15:47,399
l think you too will
invite sorrow like Paro did.

909
02:15:50,475 --> 02:15:53,706
You both are so different
yet so alike.

910
02:15:55,247 --> 02:15:59,130
One so selfless and fickle...
The other so quiet and sober.

911
02:16:00,218 --> 02:16:03,619
She couldn't bear anything,
and, you bear everything!

912
02:16:05,157 --> 02:16:07,887
She's respected so much,
and you, exactly opposite.

913
02:16:09,327 --> 02:16:18,395
Everybody loves her, and hates you.
But l don't hate you, l can't.

914
02:16:20,872 --> 02:16:24,968
This is enough for me.
l don't want anything else.

915
02:16:40,192 --> 02:16:41,989
The carriage is here.

916
02:16:45,397 --> 02:16:46,864
Take the bedding.

917
02:16:57,209 --> 02:17:00,576
Where is my scarf?
- On the chair.

918
02:17:08,386 --> 02:17:11,583
Are you crying?
- No.

919
02:17:12,524 --> 02:17:14,856
Look at me.

920
02:17:15,360 --> 02:17:16,918
Come on, look up.

921
02:17:21,333 --> 02:17:22,459
Look!

922
02:17:25,537 --> 02:17:33,467
This bag, clothes, are unnecessary.
- That l know better.

923
02:17:45,323 --> 02:17:51,910
Listen, you'll need someone
with you. Take me along.

924
02:17:56,067 --> 02:18:03,701
That's impossible. People will
insult you and l won't stand it.

925
02:18:04,476 --> 02:18:12,474
l'm very worried. You're not well.
How will you go alone, stay alone?

926
02:18:15,287 --> 02:18:18,222
l've penned to Dharamdas.
He'll come to collect me.

927
02:18:21,326 --> 02:18:23,760
Will you promise me something?
- What?

928
02:18:24,829 --> 02:18:27,320
That you'll not drink again.

929
02:18:32,470 --> 02:18:37,203
l can't promise,
but l'll remember what you said.

930
02:18:46,518 --> 02:18:55,850
Listen, wherever you live, if your
body lets you down, call this slave.

931
02:19:07,605 --> 02:19:12,338
Keep this with you.
- No!

932
02:19:14,179 --> 02:19:15,771
l don't need it now.

933
02:19:16,648 --> 02:19:21,551
That l know better.
Look at me.

934
02:19:24,456 --> 02:19:28,586
There's no guarantee about life.
Will you drown yourself?

935
02:19:31,096 --> 02:19:33,121
Keep this, and don't say a word.

936
02:19:37,802 --> 02:19:39,300
Please wait.

937
02:19:51,449 --> 02:19:55,440
When will we meet again?
- Who knows?

938
02:19:56,721 --> 02:20:03,650
But l won't forget you.
l'll never get enough of you.

939
02:20:05,463 --> 02:20:10,127
Can't say what those who believe in
Sin and Virtue will decide about you.

940
02:20:10,535 --> 02:20:15,734
But if people meet after death, l
won't be able to stay away from you.

941
02:20:31,656 --> 02:20:35,717
l'll pass this life,
awaiting that paradise.

942
02:21:36,654 --> 02:21:39,919
Decided where to go?
- No.

943
02:21:40,124 --> 02:21:43,787
Then go to Kashi to your mother.
- l won't go there.

944
02:21:44,662 --> 02:21:46,789
l wish to go somewhere faraway.

945
02:22:34,913 --> 02:22:40,100
''l came to know from myself,
how much Parvati must love you''

946
02:23:21,926 --> 02:23:28,855
Just tell me where you want to go.
- l want to run away from myself.

947
02:23:29,667 --> 02:23:32,158
l don't understand
what you're saying.

948
02:23:34,739 --> 02:23:39,540
l won't eat anything. You carry on.
- Why won't you eat? Are you ill?

949
02:23:39,777 --> 02:23:41,472
No.
- And why not,...

950
02:23:41,713 --> 02:23:43,738
if you torture yourself
like this?

951
02:23:43,982 --> 02:23:48,146
Listen, if you travel aimlessly
like this, l'll go home!

952
02:23:49,087 --> 02:23:56,323
Then go home... if you can.
- You know l won't leave you alone.

953
02:23:56,861 --> 02:24:00,592
That's why you're pestering me.
But l won't listen to you.

954
02:24:00,798 --> 02:24:03,858
Tomorrow l'll detrain at a big
station and take you to a doctor.

955
02:24:04,135 --> 02:24:06,330
This fever is not good.

956
02:24:09,540 --> 02:24:11,371
Just put off the light, please.
- Okay.

957
02:24:14,912 --> 02:24:17,881
lt's pretty late, so go to sleep.

958
02:24:38,803 --> 02:24:41,431
What's happened to you?
You can't even be recognised.

959
02:24:42,006 --> 02:24:45,635
So what's new?
- That l'm alive.

960
02:24:45,877 --> 02:24:49,711
How come you're here?
- Calcutta didn't suit me.

961
02:24:49,914 --> 02:24:53,611
l took a job in Delhi.
l'm going on a tour.

962
02:24:53,818 --> 02:24:56,252
Here today, there tomorrow.
Where are you going?

963
02:24:57,855 --> 02:25:00,255
Not decided as yet.
- Meaning?

964
02:25:00,992 --> 02:25:04,223
There's no meaning to my life now.

965
02:25:06,230 --> 02:25:08,460
You are the same Devdas.
Okay, hold on.

966
02:25:11,803 --> 02:25:16,934
We've met after ages.
Why not celebrate? Right?

967
02:25:17,742 --> 02:25:21,803
l don't need soda now,
so why waste money on it?

968
02:25:22,046 --> 02:25:24,674
But you may find it difficult.
Shall l add some water?

969
02:25:24,916 --> 02:25:29,285
l've given up drinking.
- Did somebody extract a promise?

970
02:25:29,854 --> 02:25:33,847
No. l just won't drink.
- But why remove the glass?

971
02:25:34,058 --> 02:25:39,520
lf not you, l'll drink. ls it the
old ailment, or something new?

972
02:25:40,832 --> 02:25:44,598
Why don't you speak?
- What shall l say?

973
02:25:45,937 --> 02:25:51,569
l don't like anything.
Now, what l like...

974
02:25:51,843 --> 02:25:53,470
is that l don't like anything.

975
02:25:53,911 --> 02:26:01,147
l know what your sorrow is.
But don't think you're the only one.

976
02:26:02,720 --> 02:26:07,214
When this ache convulses the chest,
one has to take support from this.

977
02:26:09,927 --> 02:26:13,988
Only this can ease that ache.
There's no other solution.

978
02:26:31,849 --> 02:26:33,817
Come on, have some more.

979
02:26:39,257 --> 02:26:42,550
l've to get off here.
l'll leave the bottle for you.

980
02:26:45,997 --> 02:26:47,726
lf we live, we'll meet again.

981
02:26:53,004 --> 02:26:59,375
Why isn't this thirst ever
quenched? This unending thirst.

982
02:27:34,912 --> 02:27:37,730
What happened?

983
02:27:37,682 --> 02:27:41,830
You drank liquor again?
Did you?

984
02:27:43,921 --> 02:27:49,985
l couldn't control myself.
- Your body is so hot!

985
02:27:50,194 --> 02:27:53,721
Let's get down here, and
l'll show you to a doctor.

986
02:27:54,198 --> 02:27:55,324
No!

987
02:27:56,067 --> 02:28:00,128
Don't stop me.
Let me go on.

988
02:28:09,914 --> 02:28:14,408
Don't drink now. Didn't the doctor
say it would kill you?

989
02:28:15,119 --> 02:28:18,611
l'll die even if l don't drink.

990
02:28:25,863 --> 02:28:27,797
How's the fever?
- What?

991
02:28:28,065 --> 02:28:31,398
How's the fever?
- Very high.

992
02:28:38,075 --> 02:28:41,602
What shall l do?
Your fever's not coming down.

993
02:28:43,114 --> 02:28:47,517
Time has come to go.
- Go where?

994
02:28:48,419 --> 02:28:51,513
Out of this world.
- Don't say that.

995
02:28:51,756 --> 02:28:57,854
For God's sake!
- Why do you cry now?

996
02:28:58,262 --> 02:29:01,629
What else shall l do?
You think l'm heartless.

997
02:29:03,067 --> 02:29:10,633
l beg you. Let's go back.
- Where? To whom?

998
02:29:11,943 --> 02:29:17,381
l've nobody in this world.
- Nonsense! You've everyone.

999
02:29:19,984 --> 02:29:28,187
Everybody's mine, but l'm nobody's.
- Don't say that. l can't bear it.

1000
02:29:30,061 --> 02:29:34,930
We'll get down at Mogulsarai
and go to Kashi, to your mother.

1001
02:29:37,134 --> 02:29:40,433
Mother?
- Yes, to her.

1002
02:29:42,006 --> 02:29:47,501
A drunk, characterless soul
like me.

1003
02:29:51,916 --> 02:29:54,578
l won't show my face to her.

1004
02:29:58,189 --> 02:30:04,526
Then let's go back to our village.
- Village? Yes.

1005
02:30:07,031 --> 02:30:14,403
That'll be good. This broken-body
is from that soil, isn't it?

1006
02:30:24,982 --> 02:30:26,574
Take me there.

1007
02:30:46,404 --> 02:30:47,530
Blood!

1008
02:30:49,140 --> 02:30:51,540
Mother!
- What happened?

1009
02:30:53,310 --> 02:30:54,868
Madam...
- Blood!

1010
02:31:33,317 --> 02:31:38,380
Pandua station. Get down here for
Manekpur, Bhirpur, and Mirganj.

1011
02:31:50,301 --> 02:31:56,171
''lf taking care of me will reduce
your sorrow, then l'll come to you''.

1012
02:31:57,475 --> 02:31:59,807
''l'll come at least once
before l die''.

1013
02:33:25,529 --> 02:33:31,593
Hey you! Take me to Manekpur?

1014
02:33:34,538 --> 02:33:39,271
lt's very far and the road's bad.

1015
02:33:39,543 --> 02:33:45,209
l won't come in the night.
Sleep here, we'll go tomorrow.

1016
02:33:46,383 --> 02:33:50,786
l don't have that much time.
- Yes?

1017
02:33:54,425 --> 02:34:02,127
l must go there. l'll pay you well.
Please take me there.

1018
02:34:02,333 --> 02:34:05,769
Come and sit, sir.

1019
02:34:25,522 --> 02:34:31,518
How much further?
- You've just got in.

1020
02:34:31,729 --> 02:34:33,526
We've a long way to go.

1021
02:34:47,511 --> 02:34:50,378
Paro, l'll come back
in my holidays.

1022
02:34:56,387 --> 02:34:58,116
You're so grown up!

1023
02:35:23,447 --> 02:35:26,541
Where are you going, son?
- Calcutta.

1024
02:35:34,792 --> 02:35:36,589
When will we meet again?

1025
02:35:39,563 --> 02:35:42,259
Give me a place at your feet.

1026
02:35:44,535 --> 02:35:51,270
Won't this journey ever end?
- Of course it will, sir.

1027
02:36:41,291 --> 02:36:46,580
Sir, we're in Manekpur.
Here's the landlord's house.

1028
02:36:48,532 --> 02:36:50,659
Has he fallen asleep?

1029
02:36:52,603 --> 02:36:54,230
Sir, have you fallen asleep?

1030
02:36:59,610 --> 02:37:04,604
We're in Manekpur, sir.
Where do you want to go?

1031
02:37:09,586 --> 02:37:12,419
Why don't you answer me?
What's wrong, sir?

1032
02:37:21,498 --> 02:37:23,560
Paro... l've come.

1033
02:37:24,735 --> 02:37:26,464
l've come.

1034
02:37:30,741 --> 02:37:32,231
Paro, l'm here.

1035
02:37:34,778 --> 02:37:36,750
Who is it?

1036
02:37:57,668 --> 02:38:02,196
Why are you standing here?
- Didn't somebody call out to me?

1037
02:38:02,439 --> 02:38:06,205
Who'll call out to you,
so late at night?

1038
02:38:06,410 --> 02:38:07,672
Then...

1039
02:38:50,654 --> 02:38:58,789
Why such a crowd at the gate?
- A sick traveller is lying there.

1040
02:39:25,689 --> 02:39:29,560
What is it, Mother?
- Nothing.

1041
02:39:38,201 --> 02:39:42,297
l think you're not well today.
Go upstairs and rest a bit.

1042
02:39:45,876 --> 02:39:50,609
Must be related to his last birth.
He came here, just to die.

1043
02:39:50,914 --> 02:39:54,816
Where was he from?
- From Talsonapur l hear.

1044
02:39:56,787 --> 02:40:00,587
Who was from Talsonapur?
- A man just died outside.

1045
02:40:00,791 --> 02:40:01,723
He was from that place.
- Do you know his name?

1046
02:40:02,926 --> 02:40:06,862
No l don't, but your son
may be knowing.

1047
02:40:08,799 --> 02:40:12,360
Who died outside?
- We couldn't find out properly.

1048
02:40:12,569 --> 02:40:16,610
But everyone says it's Devdas
Mukherjee from your village.

1049
02:40:18,008 --> 02:40:21,680
Who?
- Devdas, from your village.

1050
02:40:29,186 --> 02:40:31,711
How do you know?
- There were 2 letters in his pocket.

1051
02:40:31,989 --> 02:40:35,152
One to Bijoydas Mukherjee.
- Yes, his elder brother.

1052
02:40:35,425 --> 02:40:37,791
And the other one to Harimati Devi.
- His mother.

1053
02:40:37,995 --> 02:40:40,657
He wore a sapphire-ring.
- From his father! l'm going.

1054
02:40:40,864 --> 02:40:43,924
Where? People must have taken him
to the cremation-ground.

1055
02:40:58,048 --> 02:40:59,106
What's up?
- Mother!

1056
02:40:59,349 --> 02:41:01,112
Stop her. Has she gone mad?

1057
02:41:08,659 --> 02:41:12,720
Stop her, son!
Close the gate ... close it!

1058
02:41:43,860 --> 02:41:45,987
Dear
beloved........
