00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:23,466
then you also know you will spend
your three months peacefully.

6
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:26,437
lt's only Dewan Enterprises,

00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:29,171

free lancer cartoon.

00:03:29,742 --> 00:03:33,576

00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:52,757
What's the matter?
You woke up so early,

12
00:03:52,932 --> 00:03:54,559
There is still time fot 12.

Have you gotjob?

14
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:00,201

16
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:06,974
Suppose l gotjob,

17
00:04:46,185 --> 00:04:47,982
Hello!

Fine! Evening!

20
00:04:52,992 --> 00:04:55,688
But you will have to answer my
question.

21
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:59,027
lf a car runs 9 km in 1 litre

22
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:00,456
then how many litres petrol l need
for 32 km,

23
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:07,603
Get 4 litre petrol.

24
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:10,402
That will run 4 more km,

25
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:12,975
You can also go to Juhu Beach.

26
00:05:21,387 --> 00:05:22,945
One more thing,

27
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:27,048
Petrol price is 52.50.

28
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:43,469
Why are you trying?

29
00:05:43,609 --> 00:05:46,100
You have spoiled your car.

30
00:06:19,245 --> 00:06:20,712
You are a graphic designer,

31
00:06:21,013 --> 00:06:22,810

32
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:27,710
You have come for new product's

00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:30,180

and dry....

36
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,900
You always stuck on this word.

37
00:06:50,376 --> 00:06:53,004
Not dry but dried drain cars.

38
00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:56,409
Sahil rastogi came to meet you,

39
00:06:56,682 --> 00:06:58,843
He is here,
Yes!

40
00:06:59,018 --> 00:07:02,454
He should have come,
Call him inside.

41
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:19,403
l hope you didn't get hert.

42
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:26,571

44
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:36,986
and you have to design the mess coat,
and l have forgot the rest.

45
00:07:38,524 --> 00:07:40,719
Because of this injury.

46
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:44,994
Perhaps! You know l got problems
since morning,

47
00:07:45,765 --> 00:07:48,165
l can't learn a single paragraph of
presentation,

48
00:07:48,734 --> 00:07:50,292
l was stuck in traffic for half
an hour,

49
00:07:50,536 --> 00:07:53,027
Elevator have to stop when
l was inside,

50
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:55,803
Don't know what more have to done,

51
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:59,678
l forgot to save my presentation,

52
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,445
Now nothing will happen wrong
with you,

53
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,653
Not today,

54
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:12,585
What's that theory?
Not a theory that's me experience,

55
00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:16,188
You have finished your today's
quota for bad things,

56
00:08:16,796 --> 00:08:19,162
Now you will spend a good day,

57
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:23,328
What about the presentation?
You just start it,

58
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:25,296
You will remember everything,

59
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:29,169
lt's easy for you to say,
Only l know how nervous l am,

60
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,067
ln fact l am feeling nervous more
than you,

61
00:08:31,811 --> 00:08:34,075
l have been called first time in such
a big office,

62
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:35,243
Do you know?

63
00:08:35,381 --> 00:08:38,316
Your receptionist called me
Graphic Designer,

64
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:41,479
l thought she is talking to someone
standing behind me,

65
00:08:42,488 --> 00:08:44,422
l have brought my sketch book
to present,

66
00:08:45,057 --> 00:08:48,220
But after seeing your setup l feel

67
00:08:48,394 --> 00:08:49,918
l should leave now,

68
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:05,135
You were feeling nervous to show
this presentation,

69
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:10,041
You are really under confident or

70
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:12,874
you were acting to pamper me,

71
00:09:15,187 --> 00:09:16,950
Tell me something about
your product,

72
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:23,088
lt's an ad on paint,

73
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:27,696
Our company wants to establish itself
along with this product.

74
00:09:44,383 --> 00:09:49,218
l just gave you my whole presentation,

75
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:51,317
and l didn't stuck once,

76
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:03,032
Which kind of mess coat you
will design?

77
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,437
Have you ever meet Mr. Dewan?

78
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:11,100
Yes! why?

79
00:10:11,577 --> 00:10:14,978
This mess coat won'tjust represent
your paint but it will represent

80
00:10:15,247 --> 00:10:17,340
Mr. Dewan and Dewan Enterprises.

81
00:10:17,683 --> 00:10:20,914
that's why mess coat should be match
with his personality.

82
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:23,518
lf he is an angry man,

83
00:10:23,756 --> 00:10:25,951
then mess coat should be like tangled.

84
00:10:26,692 --> 00:10:28,159
and if he is quite man,

85
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:30,756
then we could work on pigeon,

86
00:10:32,398 --> 00:10:34,093
You just don't take my opinion,

87
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,230
There are 150 employees in
this office.

88
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:39,362
and 1000 employees from all
factories.

89
00:10:39,772 --> 00:10:41,262
You will have to take everyone's
opinion,

90
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:44,208
you just tell me your opinion,

91
00:10:44,744 --> 00:10:46,234
After all he is your boss too.

92
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:50,842
Do you know what is boss?

93
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:56,513
When we took some extra time
for some job,

94
00:10:56,689 --> 00:10:58,657
then we are called slow,

95
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:01,486
When boss got some extra time to
finish that same job,

96
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:04,061
So he called perfectionist.

97
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:09,565
When we couldn't finish some job
on time,

98
00:11:09,735 --> 00:11:10,793
so we are lazy.

99
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:13,131
When boss couldn't finish the job
on time,

100
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,405
He is busy.

101
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:19,710
When we do some good job,

102
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:21,369
then Boss didn't remember,

103
00:11:21,647 --> 00:11:23,308
And when we do something wrong.

104
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:26,047
then Boss couldn't forget it.

105
00:11:30,656 --> 00:11:33,284
So tell me what else you want to
know about the Boss.

106
00:11:33,893 --> 00:11:36,225
All Bosses are same,

107
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:42,100
l was talking about that Boss.

108
00:11:42,568 --> 00:11:44,900
who motivates his employees
all the time,

109
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:47,066
He gave extra money for overtime,

110
00:11:47,506 --> 00:11:49,997
When his employees gone sick then he
goes to meet them,

111
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:53,201
And besides all this if employees make
a mistakes.

112
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:55,413
So he have to tolerate that.

113
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:58,609
l am sure Mr. Deewan is kind
of that Boss.

114
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:13,830
Call me if you have some other issue.
Sure!

115
00:12:42,194 --> 00:12:43,661
Boss is calling you,

116
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:56,764
did you prepare this report.

117
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,009
lf you agree with this report.

118
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:05,812
then according to this report.

119
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:08,518
Last month we have earned so
much money

120
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:12,349
that we don't need to do anything
till next thirty years.

121
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:19,425
lf you will write wrong first figure
of analysis,

122
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:21,890
then results will come wrong
on every level.

123
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:27,128
You keep preparing this 15
pages report

124
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:28,797
and you didn't realize your mistake.

125
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:42,983
Just to show your institute l have to
keep you Management trainee.

126
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:46,985
Because no other company will
give you peon job,

127
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:50,090
Just because of your last
summester's scores.

128
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:53,825
Now if you have come here then you
can learn something,

129
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,329
l am learning,

130
00:13:57,036 --> 00:13:59,197
l was in an important meeting,

131
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,906
That Graphic Designer came here,

132
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:07,441
Tell me in ten words what
did he said,

133
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:09,572
Only in ten words.

134
00:14:09,715 --> 00:14:13,207
lf you can't explain your idea in 10
words then you can throw it to trash.

135
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:18,380
You can measure the creativity
like this.

136
00:14:22,461 --> 00:14:23,655
He was an artist.

137
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:27,665
You didn't call Graphic Designer.

138
00:14:28,434 --> 00:14:29,628
lt's the same thing,

139
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:33,566
lt's not the same thing,

140
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:38,742
Artist could sell himself but he
could sell it's art.

141
00:14:39,678 --> 00:14:41,270
and a graphic designer is that person

142
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:44,071
who can draw few linesand sell it
like a master piece.

143
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:48,482
Meet a Graphic Designer for a
mess coat design,

144
00:15:03,335 --> 00:15:05,496
And nobody will give you
a peon job,

145
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:29,917
Be careful!.

146
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:35,692
You are watching young guys photos
what's the hardworking about that.

147
00:15:35,834 --> 00:15:38,530
lt's hardworking to sort it out.

148
00:15:38,904 --> 00:15:41,737
Do you know whose photographs
are these?

149
00:15:41,974 --> 00:15:46,001
These are the photographs of those
voulenteers who wants to marry me,

150
00:15:46,312 --> 00:15:48,109
But there's place should be in
a dust bin.

151
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:50,275
But they are looking good on your bed.

152
00:15:57,723 --> 00:16:01,022
These photograph are of those guys
whose turn over is 50 to 100 crores.

153
00:16:01,827 --> 00:16:04,057
and these are 100 to 150 crores.

154
00:16:04,663 --> 00:16:07,063
and their company's turn over is
more than 150 crores

155
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:11,863
you are searching for life partner
or a business partner.

156
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:14,566
Did you like someone?

157
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:23,779
That new chocolate arrived in market
His company manufactured it.

158
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:29,481
So marry him,

159
00:16:39,398 --> 00:16:42,231
Forget about me,
Tell me your choice.

160
00:16:51,143 --> 00:16:52,235
l just know,

161
00:16:53,112 --> 00:16:55,410
My choice won't be that person
who earn billions.

162
00:16:56,448 --> 00:16:57,813
My choice would be that person...

163
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,150
who will win the heart of
billion people.

164
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:15,996
Throw it to dust bin right now,
Leave it.

165
00:17:16,668 --> 00:17:19,466
lt's too far away.
Only few steps...

166
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:42,116
He is throwing mess on roads...

167
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:43,395
Go and stop him,

168
00:17:45,931 --> 00:17:47,296
Ofcourse l will stop him,

169
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:55,066
What are you doing?

170
00:18:11,356 --> 00:18:13,017
l have a daily appointment with them,

171
00:18:13,325 --> 00:18:15,623
Appointment in nights.

172
00:18:16,795 --> 00:18:18,456
How come you are here in the
middle of night,

173
00:18:19,331 --> 00:18:24,428
l came to my friend's place and now
l am going home,

174
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:27,497
Where is your car?

175
00:18:31,243 --> 00:18:32,574
lf you feel good,

176
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:37,907
then may l drop you home,

177
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:40,581
My car is over there.

178
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:57,132
Where did you get it?

179
00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:00,361
l was feeling bore one day,

180
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:02,336
So l thought l should paint my car,

181
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,025
Look! ritu is sitting in that car,

182
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:40,536
So! these street dogs must be waiting
for you every night,

183
00:19:40,913 --> 00:19:43,643
When you will come and they
will get meal.

184
00:19:46,218 --> 00:19:47,742
Why are you feeling so guilty?

185
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,586
lt's an honourable thing,

186
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:52,020
Donator is someone else.

187
00:19:52,891 --> 00:19:55,155
What do you mean?
Did you heard about raheem?

188
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:57,662
whose stories we used to read
in our childhood.

189
00:19:59,131 --> 00:20:01,759
People said that he donated every day,

190
00:20:02,734 --> 00:20:04,929
but when he was donating his eyes
were laid down,

191
00:20:06,004 --> 00:20:08,529
then people ask him why you are
feeling shame to donate,

192
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:10,400
so he said...

193
00:20:21,186 --> 00:20:23,586
You didn't tell me where do
l have to drop you.

194
00:20:25,991 --> 00:20:28,255
Next Block,
Your house has come,

195
00:20:29,695 --> 00:20:31,822
l mean here is your home,

196
00:20:40,305 --> 00:20:42,500
What have l done?
ln fact my car dropped you,

197
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:45,109
So thanks to your car,

198
00:20:45,877 --> 00:20:48,937
My car is also thankful to you,
Why?

199
00:20:49,314 --> 00:20:52,477
Your home is near if it would
be far,

200
00:20:52,651 --> 00:20:54,312
then l must have to drop you here.

201
00:20:55,554 --> 00:20:57,112
Because l don't have enough petrol
in my car,

202
00:21:31,757 --> 00:21:33,281
What happen?

203
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,185
lt happened.

204
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:54,274
What happen? you are showing
love to your aunt?

205
00:21:57,749 --> 00:22:00,741
l think l found him,
Who?

206
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:05,880
Who we didn't found in 150 photos
yesterday,

207
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:09,790
You mean....

208
00:22:10,395 --> 00:22:14,092
You are in love....

209
00:22:20,372 --> 00:22:21,839
You also felt in love,

210
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:26,902
And l also got married with him,

211
00:22:28,113 --> 00:22:30,411
What special you liked in uncle,

212
00:22:35,287 --> 00:22:37,448
l was crazy about his poetry.

213
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:40,324
l died on his pen,,

214
00:22:47,632 --> 00:22:49,327
But l almost forgot that....

215
00:22:50,102 --> 00:22:53,299
You need ink to write from the pen,

216
00:22:54,773 --> 00:22:58,072
and you need money to buy ink.

217
00:23:04,149 --> 00:23:05,844
Think and decide.

218
00:23:07,085 --> 00:23:09,110
Don't get hurry in these situations.

219
00:23:09,521 --> 00:23:10,988
But it was in our fate to meet.

220
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:14,857
First time we met in office,

221
00:23:15,093 --> 00:23:17,323
then suddenly we met on streets.

222
00:23:20,432 --> 00:23:22,764
There is huge difference between
fate and incidence,

223
00:23:26,271 --> 00:23:28,865
This time l am not gonna depend
on incedent,

224
00:23:29,141 --> 00:23:32,133
Because this time l know where
and when l will meet him.

225
00:23:33,044 --> 00:23:36,571
Tomorrow evening in Shashi
Kumar's exhibition,

226
00:23:37,949 --> 00:23:39,280
l am go there by incident.

227
00:24:26,264 --> 00:24:27,561
How come you are here,

228
00:24:28,166 --> 00:24:30,464
Forget about me,
How come you are here,

229
00:24:33,071 --> 00:24:34,197
Shashi Kumar,

230
00:24:35,006 --> 00:24:37,873
Fantastic Painter,
l am his fan,

231
00:24:38,443 --> 00:24:40,968
Did you ever met him?
Do you want to meet him,

232
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:43,008
He is good friend of my dad,

233
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:46,409
ln fact l call him Shashi Uncle
from my childhood,

234
00:24:56,528 --> 00:24:58,428
Did you study the painting,
Yes!

235
00:24:58,864 --> 00:25:00,126
Then tell me....

236
00:25:00,432 --> 00:25:01,524
Which blus has been used,

237
00:25:08,373 --> 00:25:11,137
That's why you were my
favourite student,

238
00:25:11,776 --> 00:25:13,243
She is ritu.

239
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,612
ritu! she is Shashi Kumar,

240
00:25:17,916 --> 00:25:19,383
You were watching her paintings,

241
00:25:29,728 --> 00:25:32,561
Why did you lied that you know
Shashi Kumar,

242
00:25:35,133 --> 00:25:36,566
l just said it.

243
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:40,228
We can live peacefully with truth,

244
00:25:41,273 --> 00:25:43,468
And we are always tensed with lie.

245
00:25:43,842 --> 00:25:45,309
that our lie shouldn't caught,

246
00:25:46,478 --> 00:25:47,911
and to handle that single lie,

247
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:50,113
we have to tell many lies.

248
00:25:53,985 --> 00:25:55,247
May l request you for one thing,

249
00:25:57,055 --> 00:25:59,023
Never say lie again,

250
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:08,426
Please stop being formal.

251
00:26:09,267 --> 00:26:10,291
Otherwise stop talking to me,

252
00:26:16,274 --> 00:26:17,434
Your table is ready,

253
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:29,678
So you were her student,

254
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:34,156
During my architecture course she was
the professor of my visual arts.

255
00:26:34,893 --> 00:26:36,292
You have passed architecture.

256
00:26:36,861 --> 00:26:37,987
ln fact l did work for 2 years.

257
00:26:38,463 --> 00:26:40,727
l was an architect in a firm,
then l quit,

258
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:44,599
Why?
l wanted to become cartoonist.

259
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:48,099
You couldn't do the both things.

260
00:26:48,974 --> 00:26:49,804
May be....

261
00:26:50,742 --> 00:26:54,269
After spending my day in office l
felt like a machine,

262
00:26:54,813 --> 00:26:56,303
and l felt like l don't have time,

263
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:59,140
Now l have enough time.

264
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:02,446
To do all those things what
l like most.

265
00:27:13,198 --> 00:27:15,257
Do you have my book?

266
00:27:21,873 --> 00:27:25,001
Come to the point,
l know what you want to know,

267
00:27:25,543 --> 00:27:27,033
He is with me and we are
having coffee.

268
00:27:28,546 --> 00:27:31,379
So your matter come to the
coffee shop.

269
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:35,980
Just tell me how did you
reach here.

270
00:28:09,287 --> 00:28:12,188
l will tell you everything later,

271
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:32,074
Can l keep it.

272
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:24,226
When we both felt in love so you
heard our entire love story.

273
00:33:24,902 --> 00:33:27,871
Now when you felt in love so you
are keeping secrets.

274
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:32,038
lt's been two weeks and you didn't
introduce us from your boyfriend,

275
00:33:34,112 --> 00:33:36,103
Let him become my boyfriend first.

276
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:41,610
You are meeting from two weeks.

277
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,420
You are having coffee along,
watching movies along,

278
00:33:44,655 --> 00:33:46,247
and he still didn't become your
boyfriend.

279
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:49,383
l just went with Tony on two dates,

280
00:33:49,761 --> 00:33:52,594
and l declared him my boyfriend,

281
00:33:55,066 --> 00:33:56,465
Sahil is little bit different,

282
00:33:57,168 --> 00:33:58,533
his thoughts are different,

283
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:00,498
His world is different,

284
00:34:01,339 --> 00:34:02,897
Then bring him to our world.

285
00:34:04,976 --> 00:34:06,136
Let's plan...

286
00:34:06,778 --> 00:34:11,078
l'll call Nikhil, Jenny will call tony
and you will call Sahil.

287
00:34:11,616 --> 00:34:13,743
when he will see two couples
together,

288
00:34:13,985 --> 00:34:16,180
he will also feel special for you,

289
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:18,954
then our plan will be successful.

290
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:23,553
Sahil won't come...

291
00:34:23,961 --> 00:34:26,293
l told you he is...
...different.

292
00:34:28,466 --> 00:34:32,334
lf he loves you then we will come
anywhere for you.

293
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:37,063
And if he will refuse.

294
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:40,768
then it means he is far away from love.

295
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:03,730
You are here?

296
00:35:04,802 --> 00:35:06,064
l couldn't come here.
Why not?

297
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:09,937
Why did you close the door for me,

298
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:12,733
Did you hide any girlfriend inside?

299
00:35:13,978 --> 00:35:15,240
And 15 rupees for what?

300
00:35:24,522 --> 00:35:25,853
Pay it monthly.

301
00:35:26,357 --> 00:35:27,847
Who has seen the end of month,

302
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:34,964
You live according to day.

303
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:39,067
Do you have something permanent.

304
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:44,268
Nothing except my car and this house.

305
00:35:49,213 --> 00:35:51,078
Nice house.

306
00:35:58,756 --> 00:36:01,850
What's this?
My dream,

307
00:36:02,793 --> 00:36:06,957
A cartoon step on a second page
of a daily newspaper.

308
00:36:14,138 --> 00:36:16,766
Who are they?
My parents.

309
00:36:20,378 --> 00:36:21,436
Where they live?

310
00:36:23,147 --> 00:36:23,875
Up!

311
00:36:24,949 --> 00:36:28,612
Second floor!
They are dead.

312
00:36:44,001 --> 00:36:45,696
My parents were very jolly.

313
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:47,769
They always made people laugh,

314
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:51,436
l wanted to miss them after
their death.

315
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:54,744
that's why instead of putting garland
on their photo frame,

316
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:56,805
l put them on this wall.

317
00:37:04,689 --> 00:37:06,657
My mom died in my childhood,

318
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:10,353
l don't understand,

319
00:37:11,362 --> 00:37:13,125
How do l miss her,

320
00:37:23,374 --> 00:37:26,468
How do you make it?
Just have it and tell me,

321
00:37:28,779 --> 00:37:31,213
Does anyone else had your coffee.

322
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:33,776
Why you want to know?

323
00:37:35,152 --> 00:37:36,414
l will call her to ask,

324
00:37:36,887 --> 00:37:38,718
how many days she have to
spent in hospital.

325
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:41,152
You won't need to go hospital.

326
00:37:41,792 --> 00:37:43,020
l will make deadly coffee.

327
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:59,102
Few of my friends are planning
tracking,

328
00:37:59,877 --> 00:38:01,606
They will really like if you....

329
00:38:07,685 --> 00:38:09,448
Sahil! you can't do it for me,

330
00:38:14,925 --> 00:38:16,517
Please don't refuse it.

331
00:38:48,859 --> 00:38:50,383
Will you join me for tracking,

332
00:39:06,977 --> 00:39:08,569
They are walking so slow,

333
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:12,843
They both have come with
their boyfriends,

334
00:39:13,784 --> 00:39:15,445
They want to enjoy theirjourney,

335
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,815
They are not in hurry to reach
their destination,

336
00:39:18,589 --> 00:39:20,022
Do we?

337
00:39:21,726 --> 00:39:23,591
have hurry to reach our destination?

338
00:39:27,798 --> 00:39:29,959
We don't want to enjoy the
journey.

339
00:39:31,068 --> 00:39:32,228
What do you think?

340
00:39:32,903 --> 00:39:36,771
l think we should forget to worry
about the destiny,

341
00:40:23,888 --> 00:40:25,685
But his girlfriend likes it.

342
00:40:27,558 --> 00:40:29,492
You like everything in love.

343
00:45:28,625 --> 00:45:30,559
Look over there!
Okay!

344
00:45:32,129 --> 00:45:33,596
What are you making so special?

345
00:45:34,498 --> 00:45:37,228
You will have to come with me to
see what l am making,

346
00:45:37,901 --> 00:45:38,697
Where?

347
00:46:00,224 --> 00:46:01,657
Will you marry me?

348
00:46:07,030 --> 00:46:09,191
l don't think l am in hurry,

349
00:46:11,001 --> 00:46:14,095
l felt it should be the next step,

350
00:46:25,649 --> 00:46:29,949
Will you be a permanent member of my
temporary style life.

351
00:46:47,271 --> 00:46:50,172
Everything should be perfect specially
the presentation,

352
00:46:50,607 --> 00:46:52,700
Galaxy Motors is our 10 years
old client,

353
00:46:52,943 --> 00:46:57,039
lf they will have any complain then
it will affect our business.

354
00:47:27,544 --> 00:47:32,106
Your design might be help me to
fulfill it.

355
00:47:32,883 --> 00:47:34,646
Send me the quotations.

356
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:49,825
He must be impressed.

357
00:47:51,501 --> 00:47:53,969
l think you didn't notice.

358
00:47:55,138 --> 00:47:56,969
Sir! l am wearing a tie with
cars print,

359
00:47:57,507 --> 00:48:00,203
l am sure it impressed Mr. Chauhan,

360
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:05,173
Have you lost your mind,

361
00:48:06,149 --> 00:48:08,947
lf Mr, Chauhan would be impressed
on this silly thing,

362
00:48:09,453 --> 00:48:11,944
then we don't need all these
preparations,

363
00:48:12,789 --> 00:48:14,279
Competition is so increased,

364
00:48:14,825 --> 00:48:16,486
l have to impress him everytime,

365
00:48:17,828 --> 00:48:23,391
Do you think during this presentation
he got time to notice your tie print,

366
00:48:32,776 --> 00:48:36,803
l think you plan is flopped to
impress the boss.

367
00:48:39,616 --> 00:48:41,243
Go and prepare the design sheets.

368
00:48:44,554 --> 00:48:47,887
Sir! l don't feel good to failure
of your plans,

369
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:52,690
My plan is become a managing director.

370
00:48:53,630 --> 00:48:58,329
And nobody can come between me
and my plans.

371
00:49:06,877 --> 00:49:08,970
Actually! these are your product's
mess coat designs.

372
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:11,941
l have come to show them,
Come! sit!

373
00:49:17,521 --> 00:49:19,614
Show me l am dealing this case.

374
00:49:25,929 --> 00:49:28,591
She is always busy with different
projects.

375
00:49:28,966 --> 00:49:31,230
She is the only daughter of
Deewan Enterprises.

376
00:49:31,568 --> 00:49:33,229
But we have to work on everything,

377
00:50:04,034 --> 00:50:06,969
l have called your phone twenty times,
Why you didn't answer the phone,

378
00:50:07,537 --> 00:50:10,370
Any problem with your phone?
Wait! l'll redial your phone,

379
00:50:11,041 --> 00:50:14,238
l heard ring tones and you didn't
find out someone is calling,

380
00:50:38,268 --> 00:50:39,667
Why you didn't pick up my phone call?

381
00:50:42,506 --> 00:50:43,473
You wanted something,

382
00:50:46,343 --> 00:50:48,573
l couldn't call you without need,

383
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:52,379
The only daughter of
Deewan Enterprises,

384
00:50:52,649 --> 00:50:54,310
Why she wanted to call me?

385
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:01,315
So that's the matter,

386
00:51:01,958 --> 00:51:03,619
l requested you...

387
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:06,457
that never lie to me,

388
00:51:16,373 --> 00:51:18,136
l didn't tell you because....

389
00:51:20,343 --> 00:51:22,607
These things doesn't make
any difference,

390
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:25,307
The truth is that l love you,

391
00:51:26,149 --> 00:51:27,639
and you love me,

392
00:51:30,053 --> 00:51:31,816
l make palaces in the air.

393
00:51:33,190 --> 00:51:36,887
but l am a man of earth and l
live on earth,

394
00:51:38,829 --> 00:51:40,319
Our worlds are different,

395
00:51:42,232 --> 00:51:44,700
We have no world.

396
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:49,004
Our world will be that what
both will make.

397
00:51:50,173 --> 00:51:52,073
where we both will live together,

398
00:51:53,543 --> 00:51:56,910
No!
lt's not so simple.

399
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:00,780
But it's not difficult either.

400
00:52:06,756 --> 00:52:09,190
And tell me what bothers you?

401
00:52:14,264 --> 00:52:16,095
l live in this small flat.

402
00:52:17,467 --> 00:52:20,334
and perhaps your room will be a
size of this flat.

403
00:52:21,805 --> 00:52:26,674
No idea of salary,
Sometimes 10,000 sometimes 50,000.

404
00:52:27,110 --> 00:52:28,634
and sometimes nothing,

405
00:52:38,555 --> 00:52:40,318
from which Sahil l loved,

406
00:52:41,758 --> 00:52:43,953
his identity is only that....

407
00:52:46,930 --> 00:52:50,263
he is the noble man of the world.

408
00:52:55,739 --> 00:52:58,333
Then why you know me from
my dad's identity,

409
00:53:02,512 --> 00:53:06,676
Who is standing front of you,
that's only your ritu.

410
00:53:08,218 --> 00:53:10,049
And ritu loves you alot.

411
00:53:13,390 --> 00:53:15,187
Do you love her?

412
00:53:31,074 --> 00:53:34,134
Two days back which proposal
you gave me,

413
00:53:34,945 --> 00:53:36,378
That's still valid..

414
00:53:39,416 --> 00:53:43,910
l am asking you that offer is still
valid or expired.

415
00:53:56,766 --> 00:54:00,224
You have to do the real job,
you have to tell dad about Sahil.

416
00:54:00,770 --> 00:54:02,101
That's not a problem,

417
00:54:02,739 --> 00:54:04,570
Your dad and me....

418
00:54:05,041 --> 00:54:08,238
has seen many photos and rejected,

419
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:11,570
now if l will present a rat
on his front,

420
00:54:11,848 --> 00:54:13,975
then he will be agry for that.

421
00:54:36,373 --> 00:54:38,341
And what about his qualification,

422
00:54:43,446 --> 00:54:46,108
What he does?
He is a cartoonist.

423
00:55:25,288 --> 00:55:27,586
return all these photos.

424
00:55:28,458 --> 00:55:31,018
Why? You didn't like anyone,

425
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:38,392
Actually ritu has chosen someone,

426
00:55:43,306 --> 00:55:44,170
What he does?

427
00:55:46,676 --> 00:55:48,871
He is an architecture.

428
00:55:53,983 --> 00:55:56,543
Call him tomorrow at 5.
l'll come early from the office.

429
00:56:16,139 --> 00:56:18,573
You are making me nervous to
wearing this Saree.

430
00:56:22,312 --> 00:56:24,872
l thought l should looks serious
as per situation.

431
00:56:33,423 --> 00:56:35,323
No!
l came early.

432
00:56:44,834 --> 00:56:47,268
ritu! bring some tea for him,

433
00:56:56,012 --> 00:56:57,343
What your parents does?

434
00:56:58,248 --> 00:56:59,647
He was a proffessor.

435
00:57:00,650 --> 00:57:02,584
two years back he died
in an accident,

436
00:57:06,623 --> 00:57:07,590
You live alone,

437
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:11,452
You have your own house,

438
00:57:12,328 --> 00:57:19,325
Yeah l got house from my parents
provident fund and insurance money,

439
00:57:22,405 --> 00:57:24,100
Did you invest some money?

440
00:57:50,667 --> 00:57:54,125
What you do?
l desgin cartoon characters,

441
00:57:58,141 --> 00:58:00,507
l have also designed a mess coat
for your company.

442
00:58:33,910 --> 00:58:37,607
Do you have ppl account?
No!

443
00:58:39,115 --> 00:58:41,879
You must have paid tax some day,

444
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:46,421
Two years back l was a chief
architect in Mohan Associates,

445
00:58:47,090 --> 00:58:48,216
l used to paid tax that time,

446
00:58:49,192 --> 00:58:50,887
So why did you quit thatjob,

447
00:58:53,096 --> 00:58:54,427
l didn't like it,

448
00:58:55,265 --> 00:58:57,358
l wanted to do something else what
makes feels better.

449
00:58:58,201 --> 00:59:01,227
l didn't want to earn money to build
concrete jungles.

450
00:59:04,007 --> 00:59:06,771
Do you think earning money is a
simple job,

451
00:59:09,412 --> 00:59:12,438
l mean you are free lancing from
two years.

452
00:59:13,316 --> 00:59:15,750
You couldn't earn a taxable amount,

453
00:59:17,787 --> 00:59:19,652
l didn't feel shortage of money ever.

454
00:59:52,755 --> 00:59:55,519
Bring other tea,
This tea is cold.

455
01:00:05,568 --> 01:00:07,229
Why did you do that?

456
01:00:08,171 --> 01:00:10,799
You have told me for meeting,
So l met him,

457
01:00:13,876 --> 01:00:15,901
And l have decided that he is
not good for you,

458
01:00:21,417 --> 01:00:25,444
This guy have no capabilities of
a successful man,

459
01:00:29,525 --> 01:00:31,720
ritu loves him,
So what?

460
01:00:35,231 --> 01:00:37,131
l got you married with him.

461
01:00:38,034 --> 01:00:39,160
What happened after that?

462
01:00:39,535 --> 01:00:43,403
That Failure poet put his life
in alcohol.

463
01:00:43,973 --> 01:00:45,736
and one day he died,

464
01:00:47,710 --> 01:00:50,645
What mistake you have done l won't
allow ritu to make that mistake.

465
01:00:52,215 --> 01:00:55,810
Her marriage would be happen with that
guy who know the importance of money,

466
01:00:57,253 --> 01:00:59,221
You can't buy happiness with
the money,

467
01:00:59,555 --> 01:01:02,718
That's what your aunt said when she
wanted to marry Arvind,

468
01:01:03,626 --> 01:01:06,356
What happened after that?
Did she got happiness.

469
01:01:08,031 --> 01:01:09,362
What happened with me,

470
01:01:09,999 --> 01:01:13,526
lt's not necessary that will happen
with ritu, lt will must happen.

471
01:01:13,903 --> 01:01:15,530
Because Sahil is also an artist,

472
01:01:17,674 --> 01:01:19,938
Artist lives in his dreams.

473
01:01:32,121 --> 01:01:34,589
They knows live alone in
their world.

474
01:01:43,166 --> 01:01:45,828
ritu's marriage won't happen
with Sahil.

475
01:02:08,157 --> 01:02:11,058
Don't punished ritu of my mistakes.

476
01:02:13,596 --> 01:02:15,029
l can't take this chance,

477
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:46,826
You are giving him punishment
to being an artist.

478
01:02:51,234 --> 01:02:52,462
You listen to me,

479
01:02:53,736 --> 01:02:55,169
You fulfilled my wish.

480
01:02:55,738 --> 01:02:59,105
Because l know that l will leave
this house and marry Arvind,

481
01:03:00,409 --> 01:03:02,274
But ritu won't do that.

482
01:03:03,379 --> 01:03:06,439
She will respect your decision and
stay here,

483
01:03:08,317 --> 01:03:11,081
But everyday you will find your
daughter inside her,

484
01:03:32,542 --> 01:03:33,702
l will meet him again,

485
01:03:34,811 --> 01:03:36,506
What will happen to meet again.

486
01:03:37,780 --> 01:03:39,475
You dad has already decided.

487
01:03:41,017 --> 01:03:42,245
And he is not wrong either.

488
01:03:43,452 --> 01:03:46,353
Every father wants that his daughter
should marry a man....

489
01:03:47,190 --> 01:03:49,283
who can give every happiness to her.

490
01:03:51,627 --> 01:03:53,822
Can you tell me the defination
of happiness.

491
01:03:55,665 --> 01:03:58,395
Sahil! you are the guy what he needs.

492
01:03:59,101 --> 01:04:00,534
All he couldn't recognize you,

493
01:04:02,905 --> 01:04:05,066
Just meet him once,

494
01:04:05,708 --> 01:04:09,940
May be this time he will see all those
qualities what he couldn't see before.

495
01:04:12,982 --> 01:04:14,574
But l will be the same,

496
01:04:36,272 --> 01:04:38,536
l kept my business meetings here,

497
01:04:42,545 --> 01:04:44,513
What do you know about my
company,

498
01:04:45,848 --> 01:04:48,749
That manufactures Automobile parts.

499
01:04:50,519 --> 01:04:52,919
l had started this company
24 years before.

500
01:04:58,394 --> 01:05:00,385
Previous Year's turn over was
500 crores.

501
01:05:01,998 --> 01:05:03,693
Monthly Profit around 4 crore,

502
01:05:05,835 --> 01:05:08,269
Our next assessment is after 3 months.

l want to satisfy that you can take
good care of her after marriage.

506
01:05:29,759 --> 01:05:31,021
Let me explain.

507

What profit my company earns,

508
01:05:35,765 --> 01:05:37,357
Show me to earn more
than that.

509
01:05:39,268 --> 01:05:41,896
l will believe that you are
good for my daughter,

510
01:05:43,873 --> 01:05:45,932
l don't know anyting about business.

511
01:05:47,310 --> 01:05:48,470
You are an architect.

512
01:06:00,957 --> 01:06:03,221
Sahil doesn't need to prove anything,

513
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:12,264
One more thing,

514
01:06:13,636 --> 01:06:15,001

01:06:17,139 --> 01:06:19,403

01:39:37,916 --> 01:39:40,350
lts not possible to recover
it in two months

709
01:39:41,586 --> 01:39:46,319
l'm not selfish that to proove
my self l put the company's future in danger

710
01:39:47,125 --> 01:39:49,286
Therefore l want to resign.

711
01:40:03,475 --> 01:40:04,999
The climax is still remained

712
01:40:16,355 --> 01:40:19,051
l was the secretary of sahil sir..

713
01:40:20,993 --> 01:40:23,757
if you wish to do so l'm accepting it.

714
01:40:25,163 --> 01:40:27,859
but you'll not get 2nd chance

715
01:40:40,379 --> 01:40:42,040
you've to give him 3 months.

716
01:40:42,948 --> 01:40:45,644
But he accepted his defeat

717
01:40:46,351 --> 01:40:48,182
l didn't write this resignation later myself.

718
01:40:48,787 --> 01:40:50,618
You didn't accept it yet.

719
01:40:51,223 --> 01:40:52,212
by the way its in my hand.

720
01:40:52,824 --> 01:40:54,382
And l've asked him last time.

721
01:40:55,360 --> 01:40:56,884
As an chairman of this company..

722
01:40:57,629 --> 01:41:01,156
A minor management trainee
can't debate with me.

723
01:41:14,546 --> 01:41:16,411
You can't fail sahil like this.

724
01:41:21,686 --> 01:41:25,782
look how hard he tried...
if he worked hard so what's the results

725
01:41:27,526 --> 01:41:33,123
and now we've crores lost and
this resignation later.

726
01:41:34,433 --> 01:41:37,334
Which wasn't signed yet.

727
01:41:38,170 --> 01:41:40,229
l forgot to sign it.

728
01:41:45,010 --> 01:41:46,602
Will you take this desicion alone?

729
01:41:48,180 --> 01:41:52,276
Dont you think l'll be effective
of your emotional desicion.

730
01:41:55,754 --> 01:41:57,847
Because of me the company
beared the 10 cores loose

731
01:41:59,891 --> 01:42:02,553
lt happend in 1 rst month..
we've two months more.

732
01:42:07,933 --> 01:42:09,525
But l still believe on sahil

733
01:42:15,073 --> 01:42:16,631
l believe that you'll win

734
01:42:25,317 --> 01:42:26,284
l'm with you

735
01:42:28,553 --> 01:42:30,350
We'll fight together.

736
01:43:06,892 --> 01:43:09,019
what's all this?
my management books.

737
01:43:10,128 --> 01:43:11,527
l never took them seriously

738
01:43:12,397 --> 01:43:13,455
But now we'll read it together.

739
01:43:14,299 --> 01:43:17,632
The language cant understand,
so what will happend to read the books

740
01:43:23,942 --> 01:43:26,137
Whatever its written in it..
lf l teach you in your language so??

741
01:43:55,473 --> 01:43:57,202
l want the all details with cheaque

742
01:43:58,076 --> 01:43:59,703
l want to know where the resources
are utlizing.

743
01:44:06,418 --> 01:44:09,046
But l couldn't say no..
and l approved his loan

744
01:44:12,357 --> 01:44:14,587
why saying no is hard for you sahil

745
01:44:15,493 --> 01:44:17,723
to saying no to wrong things
doesn't mean we're wrong

746
01:44:21,466 --> 01:44:24,731
whatever i'll ask you...
your answer should be no.

747
01:44:25,704 --> 01:44:26,534
what's this game?

748
01:44:27,138 --> 01:44:27,968
its not game but lesson

749
01:44:36,181 --> 01:44:38,081
i need 1000 rupees.

750
01:44:39,451 --> 01:44:44,548
no..

751
01:44:46,825 --> 01:44:50,283
l really need 1000 rupees..

752
01:44:52,964 --> 01:44:54,056

753
01:44:55,267 --> 01:44:57,531
Can't you do it for me.

754
01:44:59,571 --> 01:45:00,868
no

755
01:45:12,517 --> 01:45:15,145

756
01:45:16,221 --> 01:45:16,983

reports and hospital quatation

759
01:45:32,370 --> 01:45:35,897
so many people are waiting,
and taxi's are just three

760
01:45:37,842 --> 01:45:39,241
the demand is frequent..
and supply is less.

761
01:45:46,718 --> 01:45:49,983
so this months investment plan will be..

762
01:46:16,481 --> 01:46:17,277

01:47:54,179 --> 01:47:55,976
lts not good to do with them like this.

01:47:57,382 --> 01:48:02,911
if we'll motivate them so they

796
01:50:18,222 --> 01:50:19,621
But it seems that its
time to go home.

797
01:50:33,171 --> 01:50:34,604
Can you give our name?

798
01:53:42,059 --> 01:53:42,991

01:53:50,601 --> 01:53:51,465

800
01:54:04,282 --> 01:54:07,979
Sahil sir is with 8 employee,
in which 3 have to select and terminate

801
01:54:12,023 --> 01:54:13,081
and sahil sir dont want to
do it..

802
01:54:14,992 --> 01:54:18,951
therefore he want to find some
way to talk to them.

803
01:54:22,300 --> 01:54:26,634
say all the best to him by me.
its not needy

01:54:28,406 --> 01:54:29,737
your wishes are with him

805
01:54:32,276 --> 01:54:38,647
there's no space between you
both so other can come

806
01:56:30,928 --> 01:56:33,658
how was it?
was good.

807
01:56:35,533 --> 01:56:38,001
so what do you think
about this artist

808
01:56:41,939 --> 01:56:44,840
you'll never become a artist
with wrong intentions.

809
01:56:47,979 --> 01:56:50,709
its very important to become good
human being for becoming artist

810
01:56:53,084 --> 01:56:54,676
And this humity is the sign
of my sahil

811
01:57:03,127 --> 01:57:04,856
so its the time of saying no.

812
01:57:42,166 --> 01:57:43,758
l was late so l couldn't
bring something for you

813
01:57:45,102 --> 01:57:46,364
l dont even want anything.

814
01:58:07,758 --> 01:58:13,719
You waited for me at midnight..
l loved you...can't l wait.

815
01:58:28,579 --> 01:58:29,910
where the matter reached.

816
01:58:31,515 --> 01:58:34,416
You both were somewhere
else besides party

817
01:58:35,886 --> 01:58:38,218
You must be got chance to
bring twist in story

818
01:58:41,859 --> 01:58:42,985
do you want to know the
twist of the story

819
01:58:44,228 --> 01:58:44,956
yes.

820
01:58:46,630 --> 01:58:47,289
so listen

821
01:58:48,566 --> 01:58:50,761
l'm not with you in this game.

822
01:58:52,136 --> 01:58:55,902
neither l'll let sahil down nor
seprate with rittu ma'am

823
01:58:56,640 --> 01:58:58,107
What're you saying?

824
01:59:00,244 --> 01:59:01,871
Why you're called here?
do you forgot that?

825
01:59:02,546 --> 01:59:05,879
so fire me..
you'll have to give a 1 month notice

826
01:59:07,251 --> 01:59:10,584
And the 1 month is remaining
for the test of sahil

827
01:59:12,256 --> 01:59:17,751
The month i'm here, l won't
happend anything bad with sahil

828
01:59:22,333 --> 01:59:24,733
Sahil has called a managment
important meeting

829
01:59:25,903 --> 01:59:29,964
l've been given the 8 peoples list,
in them 3 have to be get terminate

830
01:59:32,109 --> 01:59:32,700
and its just start.

831
01:59:33,310 --> 01:59:34,436
according to 20 thousands per month

832
01:59:35,079 --> 01:59:37,980
their annual salary is
240000 lacs..

833
01:59:39,783 --> 01:59:42,251
which is the salary of one month
of general manager.

834
01:59:43,754 --> 01:59:47,349
To terminating 3 employees..
we're cost cutting aim of 60 thousands

835
01:59:48,526 --> 01:59:51,518
lf we do 12500 of every 8 emplyee

836
01:59:52,596 --> 01:59:56,293
So we'd have 8 emplyees main power
than 5 emplyees

837
01:59:57,468 --> 01:59:58,696
And we'll not have to fire anybody

838
02:00:06,577 --> 02:00:07,908
So do you think emplyees will
be ready

839
02:00:08,612 --> 02:00:10,671
We've taken their consult.

840
02:00:21,425 --> 02:00:22,722
but they all are non-performers.

841
02:00:25,362 --> 02:00:26,488
we're just giving them a chance.

842
02:00:27,298 --> 02:00:29,323
in next three months they'll improve
their performance.

843
02:00:30,167 --> 02:00:35,070
and doing like this..we're finishing
the competition of emplyees

844
02:00:37,241 --> 02:00:38,538
we're encouraging the unity
among them

845
02:00:39,310 --> 02:00:42,507
And encouraging the feeling
of step forward in crisis

846
02:00:43,380 --> 02:00:45,507
they shared their sorrow
with each other.

847
02:02:36,427 --> 02:02:37,189
you can't do anything.

848
02:02:40,164 --> 02:02:42,428
The a.c motors orders has gone.
and if it will be approved.

849
02:02:43,500 --> 02:02:45,058
So the sahils target will
be acchived.

850
02:02:51,575 --> 02:02:54,305
No sirjee..
have just delivery of sample.

851
02:02:55,512 --> 02:02:56,945
the approval is remaing

852
02:03:10,227 --> 02:03:11,194
the rejection latter has came
from galaxy motors

853
02:03:11,895 --> 02:03:13,192
they rejected our order.

854
02:03:13,697 --> 02:03:15,289
they said that our products is
defective.

855
02:03:18,268 --> 02:03:22,796
since when our company
started to make defective products.

856
02:03:25,075 --> 02:03:30,035
lf galaxy motors would pass this order
by mistake, so what'd happend?

857
02:03:32,282 --> 02:03:34,250
The cars would be on the road
with defective parts.

858
02:03:35,386 --> 02:03:39,117
The cars...which excel would
break on the 80 speed.

859
02:03:41,258 --> 02:03:45,456
you dont even breaken the trust of the
company also putting people in danger

860
02:03:59,777 --> 02:04:03,110
since last 24 years..i just not only
earned the money

861
02:04:05,549 --> 02:04:06,743

863
02:04:33,277 --> 02:04:34,574
where is the part which we sent to them?

864
02:04:37,147 --> 02:04:38,705
lt should be in the workshop
of galaxy motors.

865
02:05:03,006 --> 02:05:03,700
why did you came here.

866
02:05:04,775 --> 02:05:07,938
To requesting me that l dont tell media
about your defective samples.

867
02:05:09,446 --> 02:05:12,142
Sir the part today you rejected,
l personally want to give test

868
02:05:14,184 --> 02:05:18,621
lf that part is defective..so the excel of
the car should be break in 80/km speed

869
02:05:20,290 --> 02:05:22,815
Yes So?
l want to proove that the party is not faulty

870
02:05:23,760 --> 02:05:25,318
You just fit the part in any car.

871
02:05:26,096 --> 02:05:29,623
l'll give the test..
dont worry sir

872
02:05:31,101 --> 02:05:32,762
l won't say to you sit in the car.

873
02:05:33,504 --> 02:05:36,564
Are you crazy..?
you shouldn't sit in that car.

874
02:05:37,808 --> 02:05:39,742
You might die by this defective sample.

875
02:05:41,211 --> 02:05:45,705
lf my researchers wouldn't point out it.
so thousands people may die

876
02:05:47,017 --> 02:05:50,077
No sir..my team worked so hard.

877
02:05:51,088 --> 02:05:54,057
They can't make a thing which
is harmfull for people.

878
02:05:56,226 --> 02:05:57,716
l believe on my team..

879
02:05:58,695 --> 02:06:00,822

they allready given the order
to someone else.

884
02:08:06,757 --> 02:08:08,224
lf our sample was perfect so why
their researchers said ...

885
02:08:08,625 --> 02:08:10,650
that the dimensions are wrong
of our samples..

886
02:08:15,899 --> 02:08:22,828
our sample was perfect..but the drawings
with the samples were wrong..

887
02:08:24,908 --> 02:08:27,308
l've get know the researchers team
of galaxy motors that..

888
02:08:28,578 --> 02:08:30,842
our sample didn't reached to testing
stage..

889
02:08:31,548 --> 02:08:32,742
because our documents were wrong.

890
02:08:34,284 --> 02:08:35,751
who dispatched the all documents.

891
02:08:36,386 --> 02:08:39,446
l checked it myself...
and handover him

02:08:40,924 --> 02:08:43,950

Dont be seduce by him

897
02:09:01,511 --> 02:09:02,876
l want to talk to him alone.

898
02:09:27,204 --> 02:09:29,832
dont tell sir..
he'll send me to jail

899
02:09:31,074 --> 02:09:32,564

909
02:10:22,993 --> 02:10:25,291

910
02:10:25,929 --> 02:10:28,523

928
02:12:27,851 --> 02:12:29,318
the daily news papers 2nd page.

and your cartoon script.

930
02:12:32,255 --> 02:12:34,348
By sahil rastogee

931
02:12:41,197 --> 02:12:43,290
you should laugh..

932
02:12:44,301 --> 02:12:45,700
your dream has come true.

933
02:12:47,871 --> 02:12:49,031
my dream is you..

934
02:12:59,182 --> 02:13:00,774
what test do you want to take

935
02:13:02,686 --> 02:13:04,119
what do you want to know about it

936
02:13:12,662 --> 02:13:16,758
did he gain profit or lost.

937
02:13:19,302 --> 02:13:24,968
l just wanted to know that..
do he've passion to think high

938
02:13:26,476 --> 02:13:32,005
Will he keep my daughter happy orjust..

939
02:13:33,950 --> 02:13:36,544
dont give the example of arwin

940
02:13:38,455 --> 02:13:43,984
He died 15 years ago..
but he's still alive as your culprit

941
02:13:54,804 --> 02:13:57,796
since last 15 years, when you
talked about arwin

942
02:14:01,244 --> 02:14:05,010
as many time you hurt your sister

943
02:14:06,149 --> 02:14:08,083
she choosen that hurtness

944
02:14:08,818 --> 02:14:09,910
That time l couldn't say anything.

945
02:14:10,754 --> 02:14:12,312
And the question is about
my own daughter

946
02:14:14,157 --> 02:14:17,422
and l can see that this boy is
nothing

947
02:14:18,628 --> 02:14:21,563
when you married my daughter
so you were nothing..

948
02:14:22,866 --> 02:14:23,890
even l told yes

949
02:14:24,367 --> 02:14:26,801
Yes...
you must seen something in me

950
02:14:28,104 --> 02:14:30,197
The desire of proove myself
and become something..

951
02:14:32,242 --> 02:14:33,641
l saw a greedy person in you

952
02:14:36,413 --> 02:14:41,373
And that greedy person
when became selfish..

953
02:14:42,685 --> 02:14:43,777
you dont even came to knowx

954
02:14:44,888 --> 02:14:47,015
therefore you couldn't recognise
sahil

955
02:14:48,958 --> 02:14:53,827
The good man's recognisation is
its deeds

956
02:14:56,199 --> 02:14:57,188
its written in our scriptures

957
02:15:01,337 --> 02:15:07,333
mercy,religion,love,sacrifice,forgivness

958
02:15:11,548 --> 02:15:12,708
i didn't even met sahil but

959
02:15:15,351 --> 02:15:18,980
tell me the any quality which
sahil hasn't

960
02:15:41,044 --> 02:15:42,033
tomorrow is the last day
of the 3rd month

961
02:15:44,080 --> 02:15:45,138
so what do you think?

962
02:15:48,017 --> 02:15:50,315
l can't even think about
anybody else except sahil

963
02:15:53,423 --> 02:15:57,860
lf i'll not get married with sahil,
so l won't marry with anyone

964
02:16:06,503 --> 02:16:08,266
l wish my marriage would be succesfull

965
02:16:09,606 --> 02:16:13,269
so maybe teshu brother wouldn't
be worry about this relationship

966
02:16:16,312 --> 02:16:18,837
dont think like that.

967
02:16:19,883 --> 02:16:21,578
your relation wasn't unsuccesfull

968
02:16:24,320 --> 02:16:28,984
how many days you spent with
arwin uncle, you spent with your love

969
02:16:30,360 --> 02:16:31,884
why regret for?

970
02:16:33,630 --> 02:16:35,393
l wish i'd think like you

971
02:16:37,233 --> 02:16:39,326
l myself made away my love from me

972
02:16:41,871 --> 02:16:43,395
before marriage when l used
to meet him

973
02:16:44,641 --> 02:16:47,235
He used to say that,
what poetry did you write today

974
02:16:48,678 --> 02:16:51,340
And after the marriage ,
the question was, how much you earned

975
02:16:57,253 --> 02:16:59,312
l killed his inside poet

976
02:17:01,658 --> 02:17:06,459
l couldn't understand that the
body is useless without soul

977
02:17:18,241 --> 02:17:22,507
Dad also did same, and tried to
kill the inner artist of sahil

978
02:17:31,154 --> 02:17:32,712
sahil's inner artist is still alive

979
02:17:38,695 --> 02:17:40,094
my sahil won

980
02:18:13,429 --> 02:18:14,555
is it mine or was here earlier

981
02:18:32,115 --> 02:18:36,313
lt was allready decided..
now l lost so..

982
02:18:36,886 --> 02:18:38,080
you're not looser

983
02:18:41,824 --> 02:18:44,019
are we together forever?

984
02:18:46,896 --> 02:18:48,056
this is your victory

985
02:18:49,365 --> 02:18:50,297
and our too

986
02:18:53,770 --> 02:18:57,501
no rittu...
now we're together for a while

987
02:18:59,676 --> 02:19:04,306
because after leaving this office,
or ways will be seprated

988
02:19:10,420 --> 02:19:11,751
promise me that you'll
take care of yourself.

989
02:20:30,700 --> 02:20:32,895
here's the previous 3 months report
in front of me

990
02:20:33,970 --> 02:20:36,404

991
02:20:37,407 --> 02:20:38,499
you couldn't acchive

992
02:20:39,475 --> 02:20:43,536
you're still 5 crore backward from your target.

993
02:20:46,149 --> 02:20:48,379
and your time is up today

994
02:20:51,087 --> 02:20:53,078
The jain singh chohan has come
from galaxy motors

995
02:20:58,461 --> 02:21:00,190
The news l myself want to give you..

996
02:21:01,497 --> 02:21:02,259
which news.

997
02:21:02,765 --> 02:21:07,862
After today...your company dont
need to fill tender from my company

998
02:21:09,539 --> 02:21:10,801
dont need to send designs..

999
02:21:12,108 --> 02:21:13,132
dont need to send budged

1000
02:21:19,749 --> 02:21:21,341
hence, l pronouse you my company's
perminant vendor.

1001
02:21:26,956 --> 02:21:28,150
which company's team is so hard working

1002
02:21:32,462 --> 02:21:34,396
so why thinking again to deal
with the company

1003
02:21:40,636 --> 02:21:41,830
is it you?

1004
02:21:42,505 --> 02:21:43,699
looks good.

1005
02:21:51,180 --> 02:21:52,374
or we're just like a machine

1006
02:21:53,950 --> 02:21:54,575
isn't it?

1007
02:22:01,824 --> 02:22:04,190
here's the order later...
and the 8 crores cheque.

1008
02:22:06,195 --> 02:22:08,288
to whome l'd given the order,
l taken back

1009
02:22:09,398 --> 02:22:15,303
My low cost affordable car dream
will be come true by your company

1010
02:22:36,959 --> 02:22:38,290
now why're you so silence

1011
02:22:40,029 --> 02:22:41,656
sahil has passed his test

1012
02:22:44,734 --> 02:22:46,668
no rittu..l'm not passed

1013
02:22:52,108 --> 02:22:53,132
this victory is not mine

1014
02:22:54,777 --> 02:22:57,769
you wanted to awake a business man
in me by this test

1015
02:23:00,082 --> 02:23:01,515
but nothing happend like that.

1016
02:23:03,085 --> 02:23:04,416
i'm still there

1017
02:23:05,087 --> 02:23:07,453
an artist

1018
02:23:10,927 --> 02:23:12,326
i loose 1 rst month

1019
02:23:14,997 --> 02:23:17,591
then rittu came back..
and she took care of everything.

1020
02:23:19,936 --> 02:23:23,394
i just did what rittu tought me.

1021
02:23:26,075 --> 02:23:27,542
so this victory belongs to rittu

1022
02:23:30,646 --> 02:23:32,637
l dont deserve any credit.

1023
02:23:40,089 --> 02:23:41,215
i should go

1024
02:23:47,129 --> 02:23:48,096
stop

1025
02:23:51,667 --> 02:23:53,191
why do you feel like that nothing
has changed

1026
02:23:54,971 --> 02:23:56,336
because l'm still there

1027
02:23:58,240 --> 02:24:00,606
lf you dont consider me deserveable
for rittu 3 months ago

1028
02:24:02,111 --> 02:24:03,237
so why you consider now?

1029
02:24:05,247 --> 02:24:06,179
because l'm changed now.

1030
02:24:09,251 --> 02:24:10,343
my thinking is changed

1031
02:24:38,414 --> 02:24:40,109
l'm not for this office.

1032
02:24:41,250 --> 02:24:43,150
lf you're getting me marride with
rittu for thinking that..

1033
02:24:44,120 --> 02:24:45,610
l'll become the part of this office.

1034
02:24:46,622 --> 02:24:49,147
So please forgive me...

02:25:13,983 --> 02:25:15,109
