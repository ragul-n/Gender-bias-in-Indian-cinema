1
00:01:21,666 --> 00:01:23,750
-Hello.
-Hello.

2
00:01:24,208 --> 00:01:25,208
Hello.

3
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:45,125
Stop!

4
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:56,708
Stop!

5
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:02,333
Shabbo.

6
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:03,625
My darling.

7
00:04:03,916 --> 00:04:05,000
What's wrong?

8
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:06,541
Are you upset with me?

9
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:16,916
Come here, dear. Are you upset?

10
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,833
God, look at your dandruff.

11
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:25,500
Good job.

12
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:32,208
Behave.

13
00:04:33,458 --> 00:04:35,958
You'll cry when I'm gone.

14
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:40,500
You know I was just like you
when I got married.

15
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:43,583
Shy,

16
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
innocent...

17
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:46,916
Crazy!

18
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:50,208
Okay, sorry. You're not crazy.

19
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:08,750
You are up, finally.

20
00:05:08,916 --> 00:05:10,083
Yes, I am.

21
00:05:10,916 --> 00:05:12,000
Thank God.

22
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:13,916
Have you refilled the pipe?

23
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:16,083
How could I not?

24
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:18,041
Thanks for the favor.

25
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:22,666
Pinky.

26
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:24,833
Pinky!

27
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:27,833
Coming, Aunt!

28
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,250
Good morning.

29
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,958
-Good morning, Aunt and Uncle.
-Good morning.

30
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:40,708
-Good morning. How are you?
-I'm fine.

31
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:42,416
Where were you?

32
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,333
I went to the shrine.

33
00:05:43,416 --> 00:05:44,500
Why?

34
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:45,916
To pray.

35
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:49,083
Is it so important to pray there?

36
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:51,583
It's her village.

37
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:53,041
She is free to go anywhere.

38
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:54,666
I wanted to go there.

39
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:12,791
What's the matter?

40
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:18,333
What's wrong?

41
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:22,458
The zip broke.

42
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:35,375
Please don't cry.

43
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:37,375
I can't leave you if you cry.

44
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:43,458
How will you manage?

45
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:47,000
You don't have faith in me, do you?

46
00:07:56,750 --> 00:08:00,333
When you go to the airport,
hand over your luggage.

47
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:04,583
They will scan your bag through a machine.

48
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:08,791
Mind you, it's just for the luggage.
Don't get on the machine.

49
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:14,333
Listen. Let's stop at Shahid's shop
for some ice cream.

50
00:08:32,291 --> 00:08:33,625
Why have you come here?

51
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:35,083
To tell you...

52
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:38,791
I'm off to Dubai.

53
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:45,166
Live happily with your new wife
and your son, Shahid.

54
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,000
Let's go, Pinky.

55
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,333
Come on, get up.

56
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:54,666
Or we will be late.

57
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:56,375
Hurry up, my child.

58
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:09,000
I was thinking later...

59
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:28,708
I didn't find the time, you know.

60
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:53,500
Writing again? Same old, I guess.

61
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:04,166
See you.

62
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:41,000
Hello.

63
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,208
Pinky?

64
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:57,291
Santosh Kumar from UP Bihar.

65
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,416
Santosh.

66
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,833
Ms. Mehr told you, didn't she?

67
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:05,541
I've come to pick you up.

68
00:14:06,916 --> 00:14:08,791
God, why is this so heavy?

69
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:11,416
Let me... Let me carry it.

70
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:20,958
Pinky...

71
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:24,083
Don't worry, this will take us up.

72
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:27,291
Don't be scared. I'm here.

73
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:34,666
Dubai is full of machines
like this escalator. It's automatic.

74
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:38,166
Everything here shines.
Be careful while stepping off!

75
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:39,708
I'll hold this.

76
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:41,958
Now, be ready to jump. Come on, jump.

77
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:43,291
Come.

78
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:56,458
It's been two hours.

79
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:06,916
When I came here for the first time,

80
00:15:07,833 --> 00:15:08,833
I was also naive...

81
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:11,416
just like you.

82
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:13,833
You remind me of those days.

83
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:16,208
Honestly.

84
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:18,666
Why did you have to get
a maid from back home?

85
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:21,875
Look at that clown of yours, Santosh.

86
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:30,708
Such tall buildings, right?

87
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:37,333
Ma'am is calling.

88
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:39,416
I can't answer.

89
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:44,166
The laws are very strict here.
The police fine you immediately.

90
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:45,708
They are known as <span style="style.default_1">shurta</span> in Arabic!

91
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:48,708
Won't she get upset?

92
00:15:49,625 --> 00:15:52,125
She must be wondering
when we will get there.

93
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:53,291
What can I do about it?

94
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:54,708
She will understand.

95
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:57,250
Have you met her?

96
00:15:58,708 --> 00:15:59,625
No?

97
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:02,458
She has got quite a temper.

98
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:05,875
My mother says

99
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:08,541
that if the wife is good-looking,

100
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:11,000
you won't mind a bit of attitude.

101
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:12,125
Right?

102
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:20,958
She can cook Pakistani dishes.

103
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:24,291
And she'll give me a head massage
once in a while.

104
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:28,875
I don't know about the rest

105
00:16:29,041 --> 00:16:30,708
but your massage is most important.

106
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:37,083
Otherwise, your Filipino maid will quit.

107
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:40,875
My wife left me five years ago.

108
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:42,125
Really?

109
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:43,416
What to do?

110
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:48,041
Now, I have my son and my mom
in my family.

111
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:49,458
And driving is my life.

112
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:53,833
Here we are.

113
00:16:54,291 --> 00:16:56,041
This is Jumeirah.

114
00:16:57,208 --> 00:16:58,791
It's a posh area.

115
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:01,416
You'll find many white people here.

116
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:05,166
They lie on the beach all day
in their underwear...

117
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:07,166
to get tanned.

118
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:08,791
You understand what tan means?

119
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:12,333
And look at me...

120
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:14,875
I'm applying sunblock all the time

121
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:16,833
but my complexion is still the same.

122
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:19,416
Do you think it's funny?

123
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:20,875
It's a serious problem.

124
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,208
Ask my mom.

125
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:23,875
When I was born,

126
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:25,583
my complexion was dark.

127
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:27,458
Really.

128
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:30,875
You should apply lemon on your face.

129
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:32,041
Really?

130
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:34,083
Will that help?

131
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:37,416
If so, I'll keep a whole basket.

132
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,791
I'll apply it throughout the day
while waiting.

133
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:43,041
We have arrived.

134
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:50,291
-Hello.
-Hello.

135
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:55,291
-How are you?
-<span style="style.default_1">Thank God!</span>

136
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:57,375
-How was your journey?
-Good, ma'am.

137
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:01,208
<span style="style.default_1">Pinky, did you get there safely?</span>

138
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:03,958
-Hello.
-<span style="style.default_1">Hello.</span>

139
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:09,250
<span style="style.default_1">You've got to work hard, not everyone
gets a chance to work in Dubai.</span>

140
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:12,375
<span style="style.default_1">I've sent you to take care of Mehr.</span>

141
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:15,041
-<span style="style.default_1">Don't step out unnecessarily. Okay?</span>
-Okay.

142
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:16,958
It's okay. I'll handle her.

143
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:23,583
-<span style="style.default_1">Have you spoken to Qutub?</span>
-No.

144
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:27,166
<span style="style.default_1">Your aunt was complaining again.</span>

145
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:30,250
<span style="style.default_1">No matter what, he's your father.</span>

146
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:34,541
Okay, my bossy aunt!

147
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:38,500
Thank you so much, Aunt.

148
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:41,791
-Bye. God bless.
-<span style="style.default_1">Okay, bye.</span>

149
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:45,333
So...

150
00:18:48,166 --> 00:18:50,833
I'll introduce you to Grace,
our other maid.

151
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:53,166
She will show you around the house.

152
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:55,541
Have some food and take a good rest.

153
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:57,208
-Okay?
-Okay.

154
00:18:58,041 --> 00:18:59,250
This is for you.

155
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:09,833
Nice.

156
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:10,875
It's very nice.

157
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:13,125
I don't wear such colors but that's nice.

158
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:19,000
Okay, you may go now.

159
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:29,083
Go. Go on.

160
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:39,166
What happened?

161
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:40,750
Go!

162
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:45,208
It's so messy here.

163
00:19:49,541 --> 00:19:50,916
I keep doing the same tasks.

164
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:08,666
<span style="style.default_1">Like a dream</span>

165
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:12,166
<span style="style.default_1">She seems oblivious of this world</span>

166
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:16,083
<span style="style.default_1">She sounds so naive</span>

167
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:17,791
<span style="style.default_1">By her words</span>

168
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,291
Don't you sleep here?

169
00:20:23,291 --> 00:20:25,041
I don't sleep here.

170
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,208
I go to my sister's house.

171
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:28,458
Every day.

172
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:34,625
Hasan, our son is unwell.

173
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:43,500
<span style="style.default_1">No one understands what she wants</span>

174
00:20:44,708 --> 00:20:50,916
<span style="style.default_1">She can't translate
Her thoughts into words</span>

175
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:56,833
<span style="style.default_1">Nothing is yours, girl</span>

176
00:20:57,416 --> 00:21:00,666
<span style="style.default_1">Neither the night nor the morning</span>

177
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:05,166
<span style="style.default_1">You can't control them</span>

178
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:07,083
What have you done?

179
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:12,375
<span style="style.default_1">Your lover will not agree</span>

180
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:16,791
<span style="style.default_1">Why do you want to do
What your heart desires</span>

181
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:19,625
Hello, sir.

182
00:21:21,291 --> 00:21:24,625
<span style="style.default_1">Your lover will not agree</span>

183
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:30,291
<span style="style.default_1">Why do you want to do
What your heart desires</span>

184
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:56,625
<span style="style.default_1">Those who go through it, know it</span>

185
00:21:56,875 --> 00:22:00,500
<span style="style.default_1">That's what the wise ones have always said</span>

186
00:22:00,666 --> 00:22:07,666
<span style="style.default_1">The setting sun rises again</span>

187
00:22:08,958 --> 00:22:12,583
<span style="style.default_1">Those who go through it, know it</span>

188
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:16,291
<span style="style.default_1">That's what the wise ones have always said</span>

189
00:22:16,625 --> 00:22:23,541
<span style="style.default_1">The setting sun rises again</span>

190
00:22:25,458 --> 00:22:28,958
<span style="style.default_1">It is your test, girl</span>

191
00:22:29,416 --> 00:22:32,958
<span style="style.default_1">The time has changed, girl</span>

192
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:35,916
<span style="style.default_1">The darkness hovering on you</span>

193
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,708
<span style="style.default_1">Will give way to light</span>

194
00:22:40,833 --> 00:22:44,791
<span style="style.default_1">Your lover will not agree</span>

195
00:22:44,875 --> 00:22:50,541
<span style="style.default_1">Why do you want to do
What your heart desires</span>

196
00:22:50,625 --> 00:22:52,875
<span style="style.default_1">Oh, girl</span>

197
00:22:52,958 --> 00:22:56,458
<span style="style.default_1">Your lover will not agree</span>

198
00:22:57,041 --> 00:23:00,625
<span style="style.default_1">Why do you want to do
What your heart desires</span>

199
00:23:03,291 --> 00:23:05,000
How much would you like to send?

200
00:23:06,833 --> 00:23:08,750
-The entire amount here.
-Okay.

201
00:23:17,458 --> 00:23:21,166
<span style="style.default_1">The wind has changed</span>

202
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:25,250
<span style="style.default_1">There's a song in the atmosphere</span>

203
00:23:25,375 --> 00:23:28,791
<span style="style.default_1">The memories of the city that you left</span>

204
00:23:28,875 --> 00:23:33,166
<span style="style.default_1">Seems to be fading</span>

205
00:23:33,375 --> 00:23:36,916
<span style="style.default_1">The old times
Are never going to come back, girl</span>

206
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:40,958
<span style="style.default_1">Carve your own path, girl</span>

207
00:23:41,125 --> 00:23:48,041
<span style="style.default_1">And you shall become a traveler</span>

208
00:23:48,666 --> 00:23:52,458
<span style="style.default_1">Your lover will not agree</span>

209
00:23:52,708 --> 00:23:58,250
<span style="style.default_1">Why do you want to do
What your heart desires</span>

210
00:23:58,708 --> 00:24:00,875
<span style="style.default_1">Oh, girl</span>

211
00:24:00,958 --> 00:24:04,416
<span style="style.default_1">Your lover will not agree</span>

212
00:24:04,958 --> 00:24:08,750
<span style="style.default_1">Why do you want to do
What your heart desires</span>

213
00:24:22,125 --> 00:24:23,666
You look pretty today.

214
00:24:32,083 --> 00:24:34,041
Our usual, skinny?

215
00:24:48,041 --> 00:24:49,833
Maids are bringing up the kids.

216
00:24:49,916 --> 00:24:52,083
And the maids are being paid for
by husbands.

217
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:04,541
So, Mehr, what do you do?

218
00:25:11,833 --> 00:25:13,250
The next Kamila Shamsie?

219
00:25:27,666 --> 00:25:29,250
Ma'am, you look really tired.

220
00:25:29,416 --> 00:25:30,833
Keep quiet.

221
00:25:31,416 --> 00:25:32,791
I'll apply some pain relieving oil.

222
00:25:37,625 --> 00:25:40,125
-Hello, sir.
-Hello.

223
00:25:40,208 --> 00:25:41,791
Sir, can I get you something?

224
00:25:41,875 --> 00:25:43,541
No, nothing.

225
00:25:56,375 --> 00:25:57,958
What happened?

226
00:25:58,291 --> 00:26:00,750
Nothing. Not in the mood.

227
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:01,958
Mehr, let's go.

228
00:26:06,708 --> 00:26:07,666
Why?

229
00:26:08,166 --> 00:26:09,541
You want another favor from Ravi?

230
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,416
Okay, fine. I'll just...

231
00:26:51,916 --> 00:26:53,625
All right, okay...

232
00:26:53,708 --> 00:26:55,416
We won't talk about it.

233
00:26:58,083 --> 00:26:59,958
You spoke to the publisher today, right?

234
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,958
Why do you have to run after them?

235
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:31,083
Okay.

236
00:28:05,583 --> 00:28:07,416
Ms. Mehr is so nice.

237
00:28:07,916 --> 00:28:10,291
Any man would be lucky
to have her as his wife.

238
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:13,916
But sir just screams at her.
I'm really afraid of him.

239
00:28:14,541 --> 00:28:15,708
Aren't you?

240
00:28:15,958 --> 00:28:17,750
Why would I be scared of him?

241
00:28:17,875 --> 00:28:21,416
In fact, I think he is scared of me
when I am around.

242
00:28:21,541 --> 00:28:22,416
Ask her.

243
00:28:22,958 --> 00:28:24,375
Isn't sir scared of me?

244
00:28:26,166 --> 00:28:28,125
Is sir scared of you?

245
00:28:35,333 --> 00:28:36,750
Thanks for cramping my style.

246
00:28:36,875 --> 00:28:39,458
Please ignore her. She is joking.

247
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:40,625
Grace...

248
00:28:41,333 --> 00:28:42,500
Don't you have a husband?

249
00:28:50,166 --> 00:28:51,041
Let me explain.

250
00:28:51,416 --> 00:28:53,125
She doesn't believe

251
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:56,083
-in marriage. She just dates men.
-Yes.

252
00:28:56,166 --> 00:28:58,833
Every Friday for 50 pennies only.

253
00:28:59,583 --> 00:29:01,416
What? Fifty pennies?

254
00:29:17,416 --> 00:29:18,250
Hey.

255
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:19,625
Look at her attitude.

256
00:29:20,333 --> 00:29:21,583
I'm divorced.

257
00:29:24,416 --> 00:29:26,750
Why did you get divorced?

258
00:29:33,625 --> 00:29:36,333
I was only 16 when I got married.

259
00:29:40,166 --> 00:29:42,541
He used to write me secret love letters.

260
00:29:45,375 --> 00:29:47,958
I didn't even know
how to read properly then, Santosh.

261
00:29:49,583 --> 00:29:51,291
But there was something about him.

262
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,250
He was muscular

263
00:29:57,125 --> 00:29:58,583
and he had a big mustache.

264
00:30:01,125 --> 00:30:02,625
I fell for him.

265
00:30:04,625 --> 00:30:06,666
Five years passed.

266
00:30:10,666 --> 00:30:12,083
We couldn't have children.

267
00:30:13,625 --> 00:30:16,500
On the sixth year,
he told me that he would marry again.

268
00:30:18,666 --> 00:30:19,791
And then?

269
00:30:20,916 --> 00:30:22,708
I asked him to divorce me first.

270
00:30:25,791 --> 00:30:28,416
I think he was waiting for me
to say that, Santosh.

271
00:30:30,833 --> 00:30:33,708
He divorced me.

272
00:30:34,625 --> 00:30:36,750
Good that you divorced him.

273
00:30:37,125 --> 00:30:39,083
I didn't divorce him, Santosh.

274
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,250
He did.

275
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:53,666
I literally hate mustaches now!

276
00:31:25,166 --> 00:31:27,083
They've taken her to the city hospital.

277
00:31:27,166 --> 00:31:28,833
They say she needs an operation.

278
00:31:29,125 --> 00:31:30,666
She will be alright.

279
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:34,583
-But I can't give you a leave right now.
-No, ma'am, I don't want a leave.

280
00:31:34,958 --> 00:31:36,166
Then?

281
00:31:36,583 --> 00:31:37,833
If I can get some money...

282
00:31:39,833 --> 00:31:41,041
How much?

283
00:31:41,708 --> 00:31:44,000
About three months' advance salary.

284
00:31:45,875 --> 00:31:47,583
Didn't you just send
a huge amount recently?

285
00:31:47,875 --> 00:31:49,458
Last month, right?

286
00:31:51,416 --> 00:31:53,416
Pinky, wisen up!

287
00:31:53,958 --> 00:31:56,416
They are taking advantage of you.

288
00:31:56,500 --> 00:32:00,458
Are you sure
it's for your mother's treatment?

289
00:32:00,958 --> 00:32:01,875
What's that nod for?

290
00:32:02,083 --> 00:32:05,208
I've spoken to my mother.
She sounds very weak.

291
00:32:05,458 --> 00:32:06,375
Anyway...

292
00:32:07,791 --> 00:32:09,791
Don't make that sad face.

293
00:32:10,125 --> 00:32:11,958
I'll talk to my husband.

294
00:32:12,125 --> 00:32:13,625
Okay. You can go.

295
00:32:23,583 --> 00:32:24,458
Is Mehr back?

296
00:32:24,583 --> 00:32:25,625
No, sir.

297
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:27,625
Listen...

298
00:32:31,875 --> 00:32:32,958
Here's...

299
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:36,458
Here's some money.

300
00:32:36,708 --> 00:32:37,625
Keep it.

301
00:32:39,541 --> 00:32:40,625
Keep it.

302
00:32:42,208 --> 00:32:44,166
What is your mother being operated for?

303
00:32:45,875 --> 00:32:46,958
Appendix.

304
00:32:47,708 --> 00:32:48,791
Appendix.

305
00:32:51,708 --> 00:32:54,041
That's not too serious.

306
00:32:54,791 --> 00:32:56,416
So, don't worry.

307
00:33:00,666 --> 00:33:02,416
Sir, did Ms. Mehr tell you about this?

308
00:33:03,833 --> 00:33:06,458
Please don't tell Mehr
that I gave you the money.

309
00:33:06,791 --> 00:33:09,583
She might say that I'm interfering again.

310
00:33:10,625 --> 00:33:12,833
Sir, you can deduct this money
from my salary.

311
00:33:14,375 --> 00:33:15,583
There is no need for that.

312
00:33:18,333 --> 00:33:19,500
Thank you, sir.

313
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,291
Ma'am, we have arrived.

314
00:33:40,041 --> 00:33:41,500
Mister, this is the wrong one.

315
00:33:41,583 --> 00:33:42,458
I don't go here.

316
00:33:42,583 --> 00:33:43,958
Ma'am, this is the Index Exchange.

317
00:33:46,583 --> 00:33:49,625
All branches are the same.
It doesn't matter where you send it from.

318
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:04,708
Do you have green tea?

319
00:35:04,791 --> 00:35:06,166
-Yes.
-Please get me one.

320
00:35:06,416 --> 00:35:07,333
Thank you!

321
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:13,208
Pinky?

322
00:35:15,291 --> 00:35:16,333
Hello.

323
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:21,666
Look at me, you fool.

324
00:35:22,166 --> 00:35:23,333
Don't you recognize me?

325
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:27,708
Sister Kulsoom?

326
00:35:28,625 --> 00:35:29,583
Ma'am...

327
00:35:30,208 --> 00:35:33,291
I haven't seen sir visiting the school
with you.

328
00:35:33,375 --> 00:35:35,041
He doesn't bother about all this, does he?

329
00:35:36,791 --> 00:35:41,583
Have you ever seen him bothering
about anything except his work?

330
00:35:43,375 --> 00:35:44,666
True.

331
00:35:49,083 --> 00:35:50,583
Ma'am, can I ask you something?

332
00:35:50,666 --> 00:35:52,833
Please don't mind me saying it.

333
00:35:54,583 --> 00:35:55,500
Sure.

334
00:35:58,958 --> 00:36:00,458
The fact is you are a housewife.

335
00:36:01,541 --> 00:36:03,833
Please don't get me wrong,
you are a perfect wife.

336
00:36:03,958 --> 00:36:05,708
But perhaps

337
00:36:05,791 --> 00:36:08,250
you could focus a bit more on the house,
won't that be fine?

338
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:09,708
What do you think?

339
00:36:10,916 --> 00:36:12,250
Focus on driving

340
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:16,541
and stop watching soap operas on TV.

341
00:36:16,625 --> 00:36:17,916
Understand?

342
00:36:19,833 --> 00:36:21,500
-Sorry.
-Take me to Mr. Shahzaib's office.

343
00:36:23,208 --> 00:36:24,916
What does Mom tell you about me?

344
00:36:26,208 --> 00:36:27,583
That I eloped?

345
00:36:28,333 --> 00:36:29,541
Yes, I heard.

346
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,958
He left me two years ago.

347
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:34,291
And what will I do going back there?

348
00:36:37,958 --> 00:36:39,208
I have a son now.

349
00:36:39,875 --> 00:36:40,750
Yes.

350
00:36:41,375 --> 00:36:43,000
-Want to see his picture?
-Sure.

351
00:36:43,458 --> 00:36:44,541
Look.

352
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:50,958
He is so cute, just like you.

353
00:36:51,541 --> 00:36:53,333
-Isn't he?
-And you look nice too.

354
00:36:53,416 --> 00:36:55,583
-You have changed so much!
-Really?

355
00:37:00,166 --> 00:37:02,958
So, I don't want to keep you in the dark.

356
00:37:03,291 --> 00:37:05,000
I just want to say...

357
00:37:06,625 --> 00:37:09,666
Why don't you tell me if anything
needs to be edited? We can do it together.

358
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:12,166
No. The first book was good.

359
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:13,916
This one is not.

360
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,166
Hasan is making good money.

361
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:35,333
Shall I be blunt
and tell you what I don't want to say?

362
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:45,083
Listen...

363
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:46,541
Please don't be upset.

364
00:37:50,416 --> 00:37:52,083
But this is how it is.

365
00:38:09,083 --> 00:38:10,541
-Hello.
-Hello.

366
00:38:10,625 --> 00:38:12,708
I want to go to Jumeirah!

367
00:38:12,875 --> 00:38:14,208
Where exactly in Jumeirah?

368
00:38:14,708 --> 00:38:15,708
One second...

369
00:38:18,583 --> 00:38:20,416
Oh, no! My phone is dead!

370
00:38:27,083 --> 00:38:28,125
Where is Pinky?

371
00:38:38,541 --> 00:38:40,583
He needs a shield.

372
00:38:51,791 --> 00:38:52,875
Fight!

373
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:08,375
Pinky?

374
00:39:16,041 --> 00:39:18,125
Did you see a girl here
in a traditional dress?

375
00:39:18,208 --> 00:39:19,125
No.

376
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:23,750
Pinky?

377
00:39:27,583 --> 00:39:28,541
DAD

378
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:06,916
Ma'am!

379
00:40:11,041 --> 00:40:15,208
Santosh, have you been looking
in the right places?

380
00:40:16,625 --> 00:40:18,541
Is there just one money exchange
in Bur Dubai?

381
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:21,791
You are right.
Let me check the other branches.

382
00:40:36,375 --> 00:40:37,208
Listen.

383
00:40:37,291 --> 00:40:38,208
-Yes.
-Look there.

384
00:40:38,333 --> 00:40:39,541
Who's there on the stairs?

385
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:40,791
-Wait a minute...
-Stop!

386
00:41:05,083 --> 00:41:07,208
You won't send me back
to Pakistan, will you?

387
00:41:08,375 --> 00:41:10,041
-Santosh!
-Yes, ma'am?

388
00:41:11,625 --> 00:41:13,083
Let's go to the airport.

389
00:41:14,958 --> 00:41:17,000
Ma'am, it's a joke, isn't it?

390
00:41:17,333 --> 00:41:18,875
Ma'am, I'm so sorry.

391
00:41:19,833 --> 00:41:21,791
You should be sorry!

392
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:24,000
Ma'am, please cool down.

393
00:41:24,625 --> 00:41:28,250
My mother was right, I am cursed!

394
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,083
Nothing can go well with me.

395
00:41:33,583 --> 00:41:35,208
Madam drama queen!

396
00:41:35,291 --> 00:41:37,583
You are not an actress of a tragic film.
Got it?

397
00:41:39,375 --> 00:41:42,625
You are supporting
your entire family by yourself.

398
00:41:43,083 --> 00:41:45,958
You are earning far more than other women,
aren't you?

399
00:41:46,708 --> 00:41:48,541
How many Pakistani women

400
00:41:48,625 --> 00:41:51,083
get a chance to work in Dubai?

401
00:41:51,458 --> 00:41:52,375
Tell me.

402
00:41:52,916 --> 00:41:54,875
And you feel sorry for yourself?

403
00:41:56,291 --> 00:41:57,583
Ma'am, I got lost.

404
00:41:57,666 --> 00:41:58,958
My phone...

405
00:41:59,041 --> 00:42:01,958
So what? Are you a helpless child?

406
00:42:03,958 --> 00:42:05,375
What is our address?

407
00:42:08,166 --> 00:42:09,500
Jumeirah...

408
00:42:09,583 --> 00:42:11,375
-Jumeirah.
-Jumeirah.

409
00:42:11,458 --> 00:42:12,708
Jumeirah what, Pinky?

410
00:42:12,791 --> 00:42:14,166
-Santosh!
-Yes?

411
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:17,166
You focus on driving
and let me handle this.

412
00:42:18,333 --> 00:42:19,458
Pinky...

413
00:42:19,541 --> 00:42:21,750
I'm telling you all this
for your own good.

414
00:42:22,708 --> 00:42:25,458
How long will you go on like this?
You have to be stronger than this.

415
00:42:25,958 --> 00:42:28,291
I can't go looking for you every day.

416
00:42:30,208 --> 00:42:32,208
You can say this
because you're well-educated.

417
00:42:32,291 --> 00:42:34,916
You have been to places.
I am just a girl from a remote village.

418
00:42:36,541 --> 00:42:37,875
What about Grace?

419
00:42:38,166 --> 00:42:40,333
She is also from a village.

420
00:42:40,416 --> 00:42:41,791
And what about our hero here?

421
00:42:42,833 --> 00:42:44,625
How may Doctorates has he earned?

422
00:42:45,333 --> 00:42:49,208
Ma'am, thank you. I'm flattered.

423
00:42:50,625 --> 00:42:55,291
But don't you think she's right?

424
00:42:55,875 --> 00:42:57,291
Look at yourself, ma'am.

425
00:42:57,541 --> 00:43:01,666
You are so perfect and modest.

426
00:43:01,791 --> 00:43:04,958
What if you groom her a little?
Won't that be great?

427
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:06,583
Think about it.

428
00:43:07,541 --> 00:43:08,916
Keep your eyes on the road.

429
00:43:35,166 --> 00:43:36,625
And try them right here.

430
00:43:38,083 --> 00:43:40,250
Ma'am, aren't these too revealing?

431
00:43:46,291 --> 00:43:47,458
Good. Come here.

432
00:43:51,166 --> 00:43:53,041
What have you done?

433
00:43:53,583 --> 00:43:59,875
<span style="style.default_1">I am traveling without any destination</span>

434
00:44:12,333 --> 00:44:13,416
Not doo...

435
00:44:18,291 --> 00:44:19,458
It takes time.

436
00:44:19,666 --> 00:44:26,333
<span style="style.default_1">I am somewhere
And my heart is somewhere else</span>

437
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:32,750
<span style="style.default_1">There are a few hopes for a bright future</span>

438
00:44:32,833 --> 00:44:36,791
<span style="style.default_1">I spent some sleepless nights
And some in ignorance</span>

439
00:44:36,875 --> 00:44:42,458
<span style="style.default_1">But the path says keep walking</span>

440
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:47,166
<span style="style.default_1">Keep walking</span>

441
00:44:49,333 --> 00:44:50,541
<span style="style.default_1">Keep walking</span>

442
00:44:54,583 --> 00:44:56,458
<span style="style.default_1">Keep walking</span>

443
00:44:59,583 --> 00:45:01,166
-It's looking good.
-Isn't it?

444
00:45:05,291 --> 00:45:06,250
Not that...

445
00:45:06,333 --> 00:45:07,333
Pakistan.

446
00:45:09,458 --> 00:45:11,750
-Write this tomorrow, okay?
-Okay.

447
00:45:34,416 --> 00:45:37,500
I don't know when your birthday is.

448
00:45:38,208 --> 00:45:39,500
So I bought you a gift.

449
00:45:39,916 --> 00:45:42,250
-Open it, please. Yes.
-Should I?

450
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:43,916
What's this?

451
00:45:44,166 --> 00:45:45,583
You're learning English, aren't you?

452
00:45:46,333 --> 00:45:48,666
This will help you learn it faster.

453
00:45:49,416 --> 00:45:50,916
Thank you, Santosh.

454
00:45:51,250 --> 00:45:52,291
You're welcome!

455
00:46:15,166 --> 00:46:19,958
<span style="style.default_1">I'm breathing because I dream</span>

456
00:46:20,791 --> 00:46:24,541
<span style="style.default_1">Life is surviving on hope</span>

457
00:46:25,166 --> 00:46:31,958
<span style="style.default_1">Is that my face in the mirror
Or someone else's?</span>

458
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:37,666
<span style="style.default_1">Has anyone given me a new shape?</span>

459
00:46:37,958 --> 00:46:41,958
<span style="style.default_1">Or have they made a joke out of me?</span>

460
00:46:42,416 --> 00:46:48,666
<span style="style.default_1">The conundrum of my existence</span>

461
00:46:51,541 --> 00:46:54,416
<span style="style.default_1">There are a few hopes for a bright future</span>

462
00:46:54,625 --> 00:46:55,833
Pinky?

463
00:46:56,666 --> 00:46:58,250
Pinky is not coming.

464
00:46:58,750 --> 00:46:59,583
Why?

465
00:46:59,791 --> 00:47:01,000
She is studying.

466
00:47:01,083 --> 00:47:02,541
-Let's go.
-All right, let's go.

467
00:47:46,791 --> 00:47:48,000
Where have you been?

468
00:47:48,833 --> 00:47:50,041
I've hardly seen you.

469
00:47:50,416 --> 00:47:51,541
There was a lot to do.

470
00:47:52,166 --> 00:47:54,500
And Ms. Mehr has given me
a lot of homework too.

471
00:47:54,833 --> 00:47:56,458
Does that mean that you can't meet me?

472
00:47:56,541 --> 00:47:57,500
It's not like that.

473
00:47:57,625 --> 00:47:58,458
Then?

474
00:48:00,125 --> 00:48:02,500
Santosh, you know,
I'm really enjoying my studies.

475
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:04,416
Really?

476
00:48:05,583 --> 00:48:07,166
As if I have never studied.

477
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:08,416
Right?

478
00:48:15,875 --> 00:48:17,583
Greetings! Hello.

479
00:48:17,958 --> 00:48:20,833
-You look very nice. Really.
-Thank you, ma'am.

480
00:48:21,041 --> 00:48:22,458
All thanks to Ms. Mehr.

481
00:48:23,250 --> 00:48:24,416
-Wow, Mehr!
-Great!

482
00:48:24,875 --> 00:48:25,833
Ma'am...

483
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:41,875
Would you like some coffee or refreshment?

484
00:48:48,958 --> 00:48:50,125
Pinky.

485
00:48:51,666 --> 00:48:52,708
Have you finished packing?

486
00:48:52,791 --> 00:48:53,666
Yes, sir.

487
00:48:54,375 --> 00:48:55,250
And my sweater?

488
00:48:55,625 --> 00:48:58,833
I've packed two. Checked on the phone,
it's freezing in London!

489
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,958
Wow! I'm impressed.

490
00:49:02,833 --> 00:49:05,000
Can I put her in the suitcase
and take her with me?

491
00:49:33,666 --> 00:49:34,583
Do you like it?

492
00:49:37,708 --> 00:49:38,750
What is this, Pinky?

493
00:49:41,208 --> 00:49:42,250
Yellow flowers?

494
00:49:44,083 --> 00:49:46,000
They're not that bad.

495
00:49:47,208 --> 00:49:48,791
What is so funny?

496
00:49:49,333 --> 00:49:50,458
Let me explain.

497
00:49:50,791 --> 00:49:52,875
Yellow is sir's favorite color
and it's his birthday,

498
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,500
I thought he would like it.
See how nice it's looking.

499
00:49:58,375 --> 00:49:59,833
You're becoming too smart!

500
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:02,125
Just mind your own business.

501
00:50:04,791 --> 00:50:05,625
And...

502
00:50:06,833 --> 00:50:08,041
Change the yellow flowers.

503
00:50:08,208 --> 00:50:09,333
Take them out!

504
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:11,708
They look hideous!

505
00:51:11,958 --> 00:51:13,375
-How is my darling doing?
-Is he?

506
00:51:14,458 --> 00:51:15,541
She's my life.

507
00:51:16,291 --> 00:51:18,333
Mr. and Mrs. Chughtai!

508
00:51:24,625 --> 00:51:25,958
Don't I get a kiss?

509
00:51:37,375 --> 00:51:39,083
Please don't look at me like this.

510
00:51:39,583 --> 00:51:40,875
But I was about to say that...

511
00:51:41,041 --> 00:51:43,000
I know that I look like a fool!

512
00:51:43,083 --> 00:51:44,708
You look really handsome.

513
00:51:51,333 --> 00:51:53,500
Can't you find someone else's wife
to hang out with?

514
00:51:53,583 --> 00:51:55,291
-I'll take care of her.
-Can you stop this?

515
00:52:04,458 --> 00:52:06,541
He gave up so easily.

516
00:52:07,083 --> 00:52:08,416
If I were him,

517
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:10,583
I would die before leaving your side.

518
00:52:33,541 --> 00:52:37,916
Why? If you need inspiration,
I'm here to inspire.

519
00:52:41,833 --> 00:52:45,333
When your wife starts looking
more like your mother...

520
00:52:47,375 --> 00:52:49,416
Amna... Where is Amna?

521
00:52:50,458 --> 00:52:51,583
What's wrong?

522
00:52:54,083 --> 00:52:55,500
As they say in your language,

523
00:52:56,583 --> 00:52:58,458
"Big people doing big talk."

524
00:52:59,458 --> 00:53:00,541
You mispronounced it.

525
00:53:00,833 --> 00:53:01,791
Yes.

526
00:53:22,208 --> 00:53:25,333
And it is for you
from the bottom of my heart.

527
00:53:27,041 --> 00:53:31,125
<span style="style.default_1">Are you the full moon?</span>

528
00:53:32,125 --> 00:53:35,541
<span style="style.default_1">Or are you the sun?</span>

529
00:53:36,625 --> 00:53:41,541
<span style="style.default_1">Whatever you are
I swear to God Almighty</span>

530
00:53:42,416 --> 00:53:45,958
<span style="style.default_1">You are wonderful!</span>

531
00:53:46,208 --> 00:53:50,791
<span style="style.default_1">Are you the full moon?</span>

532
00:53:51,583 --> 00:53:55,000
<span style="style.default_1">Or are you the sun?</span>

533
00:53:55,833 --> 00:54:00,833
<span style="style.default_1">Whatever you are
I swear to God Almighty</span>

534
00:54:01,333 --> 00:54:05,375
<span style="style.default_1">You are wonderful!</span>

535
00:54:05,875 --> 00:54:10,500
<span style="style.default_1">Are you the full moon?</span>

536
00:54:22,166 --> 00:54:23,083
Pinky...

537
00:54:25,625 --> 00:54:28,833
I've been trying for many days
to find the courage

538
00:54:28,958 --> 00:54:30,458
to say something to you.

539
00:54:31,125 --> 00:54:33,791
Santosh, I have some work. I'll be back.

540
00:54:34,250 --> 00:54:37,458
Pinky, please. If I don't say it now,
I will never be able to.

541
00:54:37,541 --> 00:54:38,500
Santosh.

542
00:54:40,208 --> 00:54:42,000
I have to work. I'll be back.

543
00:54:47,375 --> 00:54:48,833
Sir, do you need anything?

544
00:54:53,416 --> 00:54:56,875
Sir, are you unwell? Should I call ma'am?

545
00:55:00,083 --> 00:55:01,083
Ma'am?

546
00:55:02,583 --> 00:55:04,000
Will she even care?

547
00:55:21,458 --> 00:55:25,333
You know, when I met her
for the first time,

548
00:55:27,083 --> 00:55:28,500
I was blown away.

549
00:55:33,833 --> 00:55:37,583
I didn't even want to get married.

550
00:55:38,708 --> 00:55:40,791
I met her for my dad's satisfaction.

551
00:55:46,375 --> 00:55:50,375
"Why should I go and serve them tea?"

552
00:55:54,041 --> 00:55:55,916
She eventually came in with the tea.

553
00:55:56,708 --> 00:56:02,625
Oh, my God. I felt she was ready
to throw it on my face!

554
00:56:05,125 --> 00:56:08,625
And then just to tease her, I said...

555
00:56:11,166 --> 00:56:15,250
"Excuse me, this tea needs more sugar!"

556
00:56:38,875 --> 00:56:42,208
This is it! She's the one!

557
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:17,916
For as long as I can remember...

558
00:57:18,833 --> 00:57:22,083
Every day, in the scorching sun,
I used to come back from school,

559
00:57:22,166 --> 00:57:25,583
throw my bags,
grab my tennis racket and ball.

560
00:57:41,916 --> 00:57:45,083
So, when I met Mehr...

561
00:57:57,083 --> 00:58:01,375
So this is why you ended up
being an investment banker.

562
00:58:13,916 --> 00:58:15,166
Oh, God!

563
00:58:20,125 --> 00:58:21,750
What have I become, Pinky?

564
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:27,583
Everything will be all right, sir.

565
00:58:41,750 --> 00:58:43,583
-She also loves you a lot.
-Pinky!

566
00:58:55,166 --> 00:58:56,833
We were so stressed out today.

567
00:58:59,958 --> 00:59:01,791
By we, I mean...

568
00:59:03,166 --> 00:59:04,250
Me.

569
00:59:13,833 --> 00:59:15,166
Pinky, come forward!

570
00:59:16,166 --> 00:59:17,250
Come forward!

571
00:59:55,666 --> 00:59:57,458
Wait a second.

572
00:59:57,625 --> 00:59:58,791
What's the rush?

573
00:59:58,875 --> 01:00:00,875
Where do you want us to go?
This is our house.

574
01:00:10,458 --> 01:00:11,958
Mr. Chughtai is in...

575
01:00:16,208 --> 01:00:17,416
In love with his work.

576
01:00:20,625 --> 01:00:22,833
But I was wrong again.

577
01:00:25,750 --> 01:00:27,125
He is actually...

578
01:00:27,333 --> 01:00:28,541
He is actually...

579
01:00:29,666 --> 01:00:31,791
He is actually
in love with our maid, Pinky.

580
01:00:52,375 --> 01:00:53,291
Ma'am...

581
01:01:27,166 --> 01:01:28,708
Ahad is sleeping in the adjacent room.

582
01:01:29,791 --> 01:01:31,291
You're so concerned about Ahad today.

583
01:01:35,833 --> 01:01:36,791
Do you?

584
01:01:38,041 --> 01:01:39,541
What do you do the whole day?

585
01:01:41,875 --> 01:01:42,833
Tell me.

586
01:01:44,250 --> 01:01:45,333
I don't do anything, do I?

587
01:01:46,625 --> 01:01:47,916
Really, I don't do anything.

588
01:01:48,333 --> 01:01:50,541
What about a week ago?

589
01:02:04,208 --> 01:02:05,041
Come here.

590
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:12,958
My father didn't pay
for your master's degree.

591
01:02:13,291 --> 01:02:14,458
It was my expense.

592
01:02:22,375 --> 01:02:26,000
This is the same guy
who decides my end of year bonus.

593
01:02:31,916 --> 01:02:33,791
As for this so-called beauty...

594
01:02:34,958 --> 01:02:39,666
This taste, this style, these brands,
they don't come for free!

595
01:02:46,208 --> 01:02:48,916
You're not half the man Asher is.

596
01:03:33,916 --> 01:03:35,250
Get out of here.

597
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:40,583
Get lost!

598
01:04:56,333 --> 01:04:57,250
Mehr, listen.

599
01:05:03,791 --> 01:05:04,791
Mehr!

600
01:05:23,916 --> 01:05:26,000
Ma'am, please listen.

601
01:05:33,166 --> 01:05:34,833
Come here, my dear.

602
01:05:37,916 --> 01:05:39,166
What was that?

603
01:05:40,541 --> 01:05:41,791
Ahad, my dear.

604
01:05:46,833 --> 01:05:49,791
Let's go, Ahad, or your mom
will get upset.

605
01:05:50,708 --> 01:05:51,708
Come.

606
01:06:04,708 --> 01:06:05,791
Hello, Pinky.

607
01:06:06,750 --> 01:06:09,041
I'm so glad you called.

608
01:06:09,291 --> 01:06:11,458
<span style="style.default_1">Your uncle is under a lot of stress.</span>

609
01:06:12,333 --> 01:06:15,125
<span style="style.default_1">You insisted that we make this new house.</span>

610
01:06:15,208 --> 01:06:19,833
We are running out
of building materials every day.

611
01:06:20,541 --> 01:06:22,791
<span style="style.default_1">And these laborers are a pain!</span>

612
01:06:23,083 --> 01:06:25,125
<span style="style.default_1">They want money all the time.</span>

613
01:06:25,583 --> 01:06:27,708
<span style="style.default_1">Keep working hard, dear.</span>

614
01:06:29,208 --> 01:06:32,041
You have proved to be like a son.

615
01:06:33,083 --> 01:06:36,166
-Who is it?
-Can I speak to her too?

616
01:06:37,708 --> 01:06:41,166
Here, talk to your uncle.

617
01:06:41,291 --> 01:06:42,125
Pinky?

618
01:06:44,208 --> 01:06:45,375
<span style="style.default_1">Hello.</span>

619
01:06:45,583 --> 01:06:48,208
-Hello.
-My dear, how are you?

620
01:06:48,375 --> 01:06:50,291
I am fine, Uncle. How are you?

621
01:06:50,375 --> 01:06:52,208
Top of the world!
So, what else is going on?

622
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:54,666
<span style="style.default_1">Uncle, don't worry,
I will send more money.</span>

623
01:06:54,833 --> 01:06:59,625
-Please get the work completed.
-<span style="style.default_1">Don't worry about the money, dear.</span>

624
01:06:59,708 --> 01:07:01,125
Don't worry about that.

625
01:07:01,333 --> 01:07:05,875
You sound low, dear.

626
01:07:07,833 --> 01:07:09,000
Hello?

627
01:07:09,166 --> 01:07:10,500
Hello, Pinky?

628
01:07:15,875 --> 01:07:16,958
It got disconnected.

629
01:07:17,125 --> 01:07:19,625
-Disconnected?
-Don't worry, she's fine.

630
01:08:15,083 --> 01:08:16,333
What are you doing?

631
01:08:49,166 --> 01:08:51,208
DAD

632
01:09:18,541 --> 01:09:19,875
Mama...

633
01:09:24,625 --> 01:09:26,041
Do you want to go to Pakistan?

634
01:09:26,291 --> 01:09:27,166
No, sir.

635
01:09:29,041 --> 01:09:31,125
You want to work somewhere else?

636
01:09:31,208 --> 01:09:32,125
Yes.

637
01:09:35,708 --> 01:09:38,625
All right, I'll ask Santosh

638
01:09:38,750 --> 01:09:40,458
to look for something...

639
01:09:42,791 --> 01:09:44,125
I will leave tomorrow.

640
01:09:54,541 --> 01:09:55,625
Okay, son.

641
01:10:09,708 --> 01:10:11,333
Come on, be a good boy.

642
01:10:25,416 --> 01:10:28,375
I'll really miss you and Grace.

643
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:33,916
Really?

644
01:10:51,708 --> 01:10:53,000
Sister!

645
01:10:53,125 --> 01:10:54,583
Just one more to go. Come on!

646
01:10:54,791 --> 01:10:56,416
Buck up!

647
01:11:16,833 --> 01:11:17,791
Here you go.

648
01:11:18,625 --> 01:11:19,916
A hot cup of tea for you.

649
01:11:21,708 --> 01:11:23,208
This reminds me of home.

650
01:11:23,291 --> 01:11:26,708
Doesn't it? Open skies and fresh air.

651
01:11:34,708 --> 01:11:35,625
What's this?

652
01:11:46,958 --> 01:11:51,041
My friend gave it to me,
saying it's good for cough.

653
01:11:51,875 --> 01:11:54,291
Wait, I'll give you some hot water
mixed with honey.

654
01:11:54,708 --> 01:11:57,208
You and your boring indigenous remedies.

655
01:11:57,458 --> 01:11:58,541
They don't work here.

656
01:12:10,125 --> 01:12:12,458
So, have you thought about it?
What do you want to do now?

657
01:12:15,916 --> 01:12:17,625
I know I can't go home.

658
01:12:20,458 --> 01:12:22,458
I have to send money every month.

659
01:12:24,666 --> 01:12:26,083
You've become responsible now.

660
01:12:28,958 --> 01:12:31,291
What now? What will you do?

661
01:12:40,333 --> 01:12:41,166
Sister.

662
01:12:42,416 --> 01:12:44,625
Please talk to someone
at the salon for me.

663
01:12:45,333 --> 01:12:47,958
You're not suitable for the salon.

664
01:12:48,916 --> 01:12:51,666
They need experience.
It's tough to get in.

665
01:12:53,333 --> 01:12:55,833
Everything has been a lesson so far.
I'm sure I can do this.

666
01:12:57,083 --> 01:12:58,791
What have you learned?

667
01:12:59,583 --> 01:13:01,208
Which life have you seen?

668
01:13:02,166 --> 01:13:03,541
Jumeirah?

669
01:13:04,916 --> 01:13:06,541
That's the universe of the rich.

670
01:13:07,041 --> 01:13:08,833
This is a totally different world.

671
01:13:10,958 --> 01:13:12,333
The world of my kind.

672
01:13:14,416 --> 01:13:17,958
Your friend Grace
is searching for a job for you, right?

673
01:13:18,750 --> 01:13:21,375
I'm sure she will find you
a maid's job. A good one.

674
01:13:24,458 --> 01:13:26,291
I don't want to be a maid anymore.

675
01:13:26,416 --> 01:13:27,375
What?

676
01:13:29,041 --> 01:13:30,958
I don't want to be a maid anymore.

677
01:13:33,416 --> 01:13:35,041
So what do you want to be?

678
01:13:35,583 --> 01:13:37,000
Tell me.

679
01:13:38,083 --> 01:13:39,458
A boss?

680
01:13:40,708 --> 01:13:42,500
Just because you've experienced her life?

681
01:13:42,916 --> 01:13:44,333
Crazy girl.

682
01:13:45,041 --> 01:13:46,791
Just do whatever comes your way.

683
01:13:58,958 --> 01:14:00,541
You look beautiful.

684
01:14:11,875 --> 01:14:13,250
Hi, everyone.

685
01:14:20,875 --> 01:14:22,666
What are you doing?

686
01:14:23,583 --> 01:14:25,458
Do it like this.

687
01:14:25,583 --> 01:14:27,541
Move your hip like this...

688
01:14:27,708 --> 01:14:28,541
Right.

689
01:14:28,833 --> 01:14:31,416
This is what people see.
It's not the '80s anymore.

690
01:14:32,375 --> 01:14:33,916
Hey, Timmy.

691
01:14:40,791 --> 01:14:42,291
Where were you?

692
01:14:42,666 --> 01:14:45,166
That dog has been sniffing around.

693
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,333
Where would I go?

694
01:14:48,541 --> 01:14:49,833
I was around.

695
01:14:51,375 --> 01:14:52,291
Listen...

696
01:14:52,791 --> 01:14:54,041
Is her makeup done?

697
01:14:54,291 --> 01:14:55,208
Yes.

698
01:14:55,291 --> 01:14:57,291
Come, do my makeup.

699
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,583
Did you go to the doctor?
Got a checkup done?

700
01:15:07,666 --> 01:15:08,791
All good?

701
01:15:09,583 --> 01:15:10,666
Thank God.

702
01:15:15,458 --> 01:15:16,916
Do you have money for medicine?

703
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:17,916
Yes.

704
01:15:19,208 --> 01:15:20,166
Timmy.

705
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:22,208
There's a girl I know.

706
01:15:23,333 --> 01:15:24,708
She's looking for a job.

707
01:15:26,083 --> 01:15:28,166
Talk to Saleem.
Maybe he's looking to hire.

708
01:15:28,958 --> 01:15:31,041
No. Idiot.

709
01:15:31,166 --> 01:15:32,416
She's not that kind of a girl.

710
01:15:34,500 --> 01:15:39,833
If you come across a decent job,
let me know.

711
01:15:39,916 --> 01:15:40,791
Okay.

712
01:15:41,416 --> 01:15:42,500
I will.

713
01:16:52,375 --> 01:16:56,708
<span style="style.default_1">If anguish is my fate then so be it</span>

714
01:16:56,833 --> 01:17:03,166
<span style="style.default_1">Come to me, if only
To cause me further anguish</span>

715
01:17:03,250 --> 01:17:07,333
<span style="style.default_1">If anguish is my fate then so be it</span>

716
01:17:07,458 --> 01:17:13,791
<span style="style.default_1">Come to me, if only
To cause me further anguish</span>

717
01:17:13,958 --> 01:17:18,291
<span style="style.default_1">If anguish is my fate then so be it</span>

718
01:17:18,375 --> 01:17:22,208
<span style="style.default_1">Come to</span>

719
01:17:22,666 --> 01:17:28,625
<span style="style.default_1">Abandon me yet again</span>

720
01:17:29,250 --> 01:17:33,458
<span style="style.default_1">If anguish is my fate then so be it</span>

721
01:17:33,541 --> 01:17:39,750
<span style="style.default_1">Come to me, if only
To cause me further anguish</span>

722
01:17:39,875 --> 01:17:43,125
<span style="style.default_1">If anguish is my fate then so be it</span>

723
01:17:57,500 --> 01:18:00,208
<span style="style.default_1">Too long you have deprived me</span>

724
01:18:00,833 --> 01:18:07,666
<span style="style.default_1">Of the pathos of longing</span>

725
01:18:07,875 --> 01:18:10,875
<span style="style.default_1">Too long you have deprived me</span>

726
01:18:11,125 --> 01:18:17,083
<span style="style.default_1">Of the pathos of longing</span>

727
01:18:18,041 --> 01:18:23,291
<span style="style.default_1">Too long</span>

728
01:18:26,250 --> 01:18:27,541
Hello, Dad.

729
01:18:28,875 --> 01:18:33,958
<span style="style.default_1">Too long you have deprived me</span>

730
01:18:35,125 --> 01:18:37,791
I have been playing this song
for the last two hours

731
01:18:38,750 --> 01:18:40,208
to welcome you.

732
01:18:43,041 --> 01:18:47,000
"Till now my heart
has some expectations from you.

733
01:18:48,625 --> 01:18:50,000
So, come just to..."

734
01:18:50,708 --> 01:18:54,125
"So come, just to snuff out
the last flickering torch of hope!"

735
01:19:00,291 --> 01:19:07,291
<span style="style.default_1">Too long you have deprived me</span>

736
01:19:07,791 --> 01:19:09,000
How are you?

737
01:19:11,333 --> 01:19:13,041
I'm fine. And you?

738
01:19:19,541 --> 01:19:22,291
-Hello!
-Hello!

739
01:19:28,750 --> 01:19:29,791
Please sit.

740
01:19:31,791 --> 01:19:33,625
I should go freshen up.

741
01:19:33,750 --> 01:19:35,083
Sure, go ahead.

742
01:20:04,500 --> 01:20:05,750
Hello.

743
01:20:06,500 --> 01:20:08,625
-Hello.
-Hello.

744
01:20:09,833 --> 01:20:11,500
You look so tired.

745
01:20:11,625 --> 01:20:14,625
Yes, I had a night shift.
It was a bit hectic.

746
01:20:15,833 --> 01:20:17,833
-Come here, take a seat.
-Has...

747
01:20:18,125 --> 01:20:19,375
Has Mehr arrived?

748
01:20:19,541 --> 01:20:20,541
She just got here.

749
01:20:21,333 --> 01:20:23,333
This is the first time I'm meeting her.

750
01:20:23,458 --> 01:20:26,291
So, we will have lunch together
and then I'll get some rest.

751
01:20:26,833 --> 01:20:27,958
-Sure.
-Okay?

752
01:20:49,166 --> 01:20:50,041
It was okay.

753
01:20:50,625 --> 01:20:52,416
It was a short flight of just three hours.

754
01:21:02,291 --> 01:21:03,666
Your daughter lives there, Dad.

755
01:21:29,583 --> 01:21:30,875
-What is it?
-What?

756
01:21:34,750 --> 01:21:36,458
Have some rice, dear. You didn't have it.

757
01:21:36,583 --> 01:21:37,916
No...

758
01:21:38,166 --> 01:21:39,833
She doesn't like rice!

759
01:21:40,208 --> 01:21:41,875
Don't worry, ma'am.

760
01:21:43,583 --> 01:21:46,458
He's upset because I said something
about his favorite poet.

761
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:52,500
Dad, do you really think

762
01:22:13,541 --> 01:22:14,916
I've started eating rice now?

763
01:22:48,458 --> 01:22:51,041
Can you give a haircut?
A manicure? A pedicure?

764
01:22:52,666 --> 01:22:54,375
Sir, should I consider this a job offer?

765
01:22:54,541 --> 01:22:56,083
Yes, but on one condition.

766
01:22:56,208 --> 01:23:00,583
You need to clean, cook and take care
of the kids. Will you manage?

767
01:23:00,666 --> 01:23:01,791
Yes, I will.

768
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,958
You have to change yourself.
You need to be presentable.

769
01:23:05,666 --> 01:23:07,166
What's wrong with these clothes?

770
01:23:07,291 --> 01:23:09,791
I would suggest that you
do a training course first.

771
01:23:09,875 --> 01:23:11,458
Otherwise, it will be difficult.

772
01:23:11,708 --> 01:23:14,625
You must wear a traditional dress,
that's easy to wear and to work in.

773
01:23:14,708 --> 01:23:15,833
You look too fashionable.

774
01:23:16,291 --> 01:23:18,708
So, should I wait for you?

775
01:23:18,958 --> 01:23:20,083
No, sir.

776
01:23:29,458 --> 01:23:32,291
<span style="style.default_1">-Think over it and then come back.
-Okay.</span>

777
01:24:52,208 --> 01:24:53,125
Pinky.

778
01:24:53,375 --> 01:24:54,291
Pinky!

779
01:24:56,375 --> 01:24:58,250
-Santosh has--
-Santosh.

780
01:25:11,166 --> 01:25:14,750
We used to work together in the villa.

781
01:25:18,916 --> 01:25:22,083
Ma'am is now in Pakistan.

782
01:25:23,666 --> 01:25:25,250
So, sir doesn't need me.

783
01:25:28,875 --> 01:25:30,583
They have sponsored my visa.

784
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,166
They have permitted me
to work at some other place.

785
01:25:33,250 --> 01:25:34,291
Good morning.

786
01:25:37,958 --> 01:25:39,166
Good morning.

787
01:25:40,958 --> 01:25:42,125
Coffee for you.

788
01:26:20,666 --> 01:26:22,166
She looks like a hard worker.

789
01:26:23,541 --> 01:26:25,458
Let's try her out.

790
01:26:29,291 --> 01:26:30,375
I have the job?

791
01:27:18,916 --> 01:27:20,083
What are you reading?

792
01:27:26,458 --> 01:27:30,166
Your generation
is totally enamored by Manto.

793
01:27:30,250 --> 01:27:32,583
There are plenty of good writers.

794
01:27:33,250 --> 01:27:37,791
One or two become stars and celebrities

795
01:27:37,875 --> 01:27:40,708
and the rest fade away into oblivion.

796
01:27:44,708 --> 01:27:46,708
Give me suggestions on what to read.

797
01:27:47,625 --> 01:27:48,458
Go ahead.

798
01:27:48,541 --> 01:27:51,208
There's Rajinder Singh Bedi,
there's Ismat Chughtai...

799
01:27:51,583 --> 01:27:53,166
There's Ghulam Abbas, and...

800
01:27:53,625 --> 01:27:54,750
Qurat-Ul-Ain Haider.

801
01:27:57,083 --> 01:28:00,875
Read them sometime, my darling.

802
01:28:17,625 --> 01:28:20,083
How is your writing going?

803
01:29:05,458 --> 01:29:06,333
For now,

804
01:29:06,791 --> 01:29:08,000
take this blanket

805
01:29:08,083 --> 01:29:11,166
before you catch a cold.

806
01:29:11,833 --> 01:29:14,666
And then you'll fall sick
and make me sick too.

807
01:29:18,333 --> 01:29:19,916
How sad.

808
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:24,541
My wife has no sense of romance.

809
01:29:25,250 --> 01:29:26,791
Had I known this before, I would have...

810
01:29:26,875 --> 01:29:28,625
What would have you done?

811
01:29:28,791 --> 01:29:29,875
It's not too late.

812
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:31,875
I can leave you and go back to Karachi.

813
01:29:32,375 --> 01:29:34,125
You'll be sorry.

814
01:29:34,666 --> 01:29:35,708
Mom, come on.

815
01:29:39,500 --> 01:29:40,750
Here, at this point, please.

816
01:29:41,125 --> 01:29:45,416
Behold. What airs and graces.

817
01:29:45,500 --> 01:29:46,458
Exquisite.

818
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:51,041
How can I not fall for them every time?

819
01:30:18,083 --> 01:30:19,333
Ahad, my baby.

820
01:31:12,875 --> 01:31:13,833
Tea?

821
01:31:19,833 --> 01:31:21,125
I've put cardamom.

822
01:31:27,250 --> 01:31:28,708
It's not as good as what Mom makes.

823
01:31:38,458 --> 01:31:39,583
Please.

824
01:31:50,958 --> 01:31:52,166
Six months.

825
01:31:55,375 --> 01:31:57,041
That's hardly any time.

826
01:32:03,333 --> 01:32:04,541
You know...

827
01:32:08,250 --> 01:32:09,541
Even more than she loved me.

828
01:32:48,708 --> 01:32:51,041
No one can replace Sania.

829
01:32:54,625 --> 01:32:56,875
Jahan Ara knows this very well.

830
01:32:58,416 --> 01:33:00,708
She doesn't resent this?

831
01:33:02,958 --> 01:33:07,000
Loneliness is a slow poison, my child.

832
01:33:10,750 --> 01:33:13,041
Especially in old age.

833
01:33:16,250 --> 01:33:21,125
You feel like everything around you
is on fast forward,

834
01:33:21,250 --> 01:33:27,458
while you drag yourself in slow motion.

835
01:33:29,375 --> 01:33:31,666
You need support.

836
01:33:34,083 --> 01:33:35,583
And so...

837
01:33:39,583 --> 01:33:41,125
maybe I...

838
01:33:41,875 --> 01:33:43,958
became Jahan Ara's support...

839
01:33:46,583 --> 01:33:48,000
and she became my support.

840
01:33:55,041 --> 01:33:56,625
How's Hasan?

841
01:33:57,625 --> 01:33:59,250
He is fine.

842
01:34:01,333 --> 01:34:03,458
Won't you bring Ahad here?

843
01:34:04,500 --> 01:34:05,708
He must see

844
01:34:06,125 --> 01:34:08,666
how beautiful his country is.

845
01:34:08,791 --> 01:34:09,625
I'll bring him.

846
01:34:11,041 --> 01:34:12,708
I'll bring him soon.

847
01:34:36,416 --> 01:34:39,166
<span style="style.default_1">When I chose</span>

848
01:34:39,291 --> 01:34:43,750
<span style="style.default_1">Self-belief for myself</span>

849
01:34:47,375 --> 01:34:52,083
<span style="style.default_1">I became</span>

850
01:34:52,458 --> 01:34:56,250
<span style="style.default_1">A better version of myself</span>

851
01:34:56,833 --> 01:34:59,708
<span style="style.default_1">The heart is a wanderer</span>

852
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,458
<span style="style.default_1">When I chose</span>

853
01:35:16,541 --> 01:35:21,000
<span style="style.default_1">To make myself free</span>

854
01:35:24,625 --> 01:35:28,666
<span style="style.default_1">I walked on the path</span>

855
01:35:29,041 --> 01:35:33,291
<span style="style.default_1">Of love</span>

856
01:35:34,458 --> 01:35:36,958
<span style="style.default_1">The heart is a wanderer</span>

857
01:35:37,083 --> 01:35:38,291
What happened, dear?

858
01:35:43,208 --> 01:35:45,250
Come here, lie down.

859
01:35:45,833 --> 01:35:48,416
Come here, what happened?

860
01:36:24,041 --> 01:36:25,250
No, my son...

861
01:36:37,291 --> 01:36:41,333
<span style="style.default_1">I found the house of dreams
That dwells in me</span>

862
01:36:41,416 --> 01:36:42,833
Dad, did you see this shot?

863
01:36:48,125 --> 01:36:50,208
<span style="style.default_1">And the doors of wishes</span>

864
01:36:50,291 --> 01:36:56,291
<span style="style.default_1">Once again got opened</span>

865
01:36:58,875 --> 01:37:04,333
<span style="style.default_1">I have recognized</span>

866
01:37:04,416 --> 01:37:06,750
<span style="style.default_1">It's the new dawn</span>

867
01:37:09,416 --> 01:37:16,416
<span style="style.default_1">I know it's a new prayer</span>

868
01:37:18,333 --> 01:37:23,208
<span style="style.default_1">The heart is a wanderer</span>

869
01:37:28,916 --> 01:37:34,083
<span style="style.default_1">The heart is a wanderer</span>

870
01:37:39,666 --> 01:37:41,833
<span style="style.default_1">The heart is a wanderer</span>

871
01:37:41,958 --> 01:37:46,416
<span style="style.default_1">I have thought and I have found</span>

872
01:37:46,500 --> 01:37:51,541
<span style="style.default_1">I have wished and I have got</span>

873
01:37:52,083 --> 01:37:57,166
<span style="style.default_1">I have thought and I have found</span>

874
01:37:57,250 --> 01:38:02,500
<span style="style.default_1">I have wished and I have got</span>

875
01:38:02,583 --> 01:38:07,708
<span style="style.default_1">I have thought and I have found</span>

876
01:38:07,958 --> 01:38:13,291

01:38:13,416 --> 01:38:18,416

01:38:18,791 --> 01:38:23,666
<span style="style.default_1">I have wished and I have got</span>

879
01:38:43,791 --> 01:38:46,583
<span style="style.default_1">The heart is a wanderer</span>

880
01:39:03,791 --> 01:39:05,791
Okay, goodnight. Sweet dreams.

881
01:39:21,041 --> 01:39:22,291
You know...

882
01:39:24,458 --> 01:39:26,625
Ten years have passed
in a blink of an eye.

883
01:39:29,541 --> 01:39:31,208
Running in this rat race,

884
01:39:32,458 --> 01:39:34,000
I'm trying to make money,

885
01:39:35,166 --> 01:39:37,375
hoping my son's future
will be brighter than mine.

886
01:39:39,291 --> 01:39:40,666
I'm laughing

887
01:39:40,791 --> 01:39:42,500
and making others laugh.

888
01:39:43,791 --> 01:39:45,208
But the truth is,

889
01:39:46,166 --> 01:39:50,000
deep down, I feel totally empty and alone.

890
01:39:56,625 --> 01:39:57,916
You know what, Pinky?

891
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:04,083
No matter how strong a man pretends he is,

892
01:40:05,583 --> 01:40:07,791
he will always need a woman's support.

893
01:40:08,333 --> 01:40:09,958
This is the law of nature.

894
01:40:10,875 --> 01:40:12,000
Isn't it?

895
01:40:15,125 --> 01:40:17,833
Santosh, you are my best friend.

896
01:40:18,208 --> 01:40:20,083
-My only one.
-Please.

897
01:40:21,041 --> 01:40:23,583
You don't need to say anything more.

898
01:40:25,458 --> 01:40:27,458
I know you well enough now.

899
01:40:42,208 --> 01:40:43,833
Pinky, I've decided to go back...

900
01:40:46,166 --> 01:40:47,000
to my village...

901
01:40:47,083 --> 01:40:48,208
To my place...

902
01:40:48,458 --> 01:40:49,458
To UP.

903
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:54,750
I'm missing my family.

904
01:40:57,583 --> 01:40:59,125
My son is there.

905
01:41:01,458 --> 01:41:04,708
I want to be with him. He needs me.

906
01:41:05,875 --> 01:41:08,958
And my mother is unwell these days.

907
01:41:12,041 --> 01:41:14,041
She too needs her son to be with her.

908
01:41:16,416 --> 01:41:17,791
Frankly...

909
01:41:18,958 --> 01:41:23,333
I want to start living for myself now.

910
01:41:29,041 --> 01:41:30,583
Can I tell you something?

911
01:41:33,583 --> 01:41:34,833
My mother...

912
01:41:37,416 --> 01:41:40,500
She wants me to marry a girl back home.

913
01:41:50,750 --> 01:41:52,750
You know what I said to Mom?

914
01:41:55,833 --> 01:41:59,541
I asked, what if this one runs away too?

915
01:42:03,250 --> 01:42:04,666
She won't.

916
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:40,458
May I ask you something?

917
01:42:40,833 --> 01:42:41,666
Yes.

918
01:43:01,666 --> 01:43:04,458
She used to come
and help around the house.

919
01:43:05,166 --> 01:43:08,041
I sent her to school.

920
01:43:09,041 --> 01:43:12,916
When she finished her matriculation,
I sent her to a nursing school.

921
01:43:14,208 --> 01:43:16,833
Then by the grace of God,
she qualified as a nurse

922
01:43:17,458 --> 01:43:19,250
and soon after, she was married off.

923
01:43:20,041 --> 01:43:23,125
But unfortunately, she was widowed
at a very young age.

924
01:43:24,291 --> 01:43:28,666
And now she works
as a nurse during the day,

925
01:43:29,333 --> 01:43:31,958
and in the evening, she gives us company.

926
01:43:45,500 --> 01:43:50,833
You can't imagine
how happy your father is.

927
01:43:54,250 --> 01:43:55,375
And so am I.

928
01:44:19,291 --> 01:44:20,458
Who is it?

929
01:44:28,125 --> 01:44:29,041
Dad?

930
01:44:29,125 --> 01:44:30,208
Mehr...

931
01:44:31,166 --> 01:44:32,958
Is everything all right?

932
01:44:35,708 --> 01:44:36,916
What happened?

933
01:45:26,708 --> 01:45:27,666
Uncle...

934
01:45:28,375 --> 01:45:30,000
It's time we bathe the body.

935
01:45:30,250 --> 01:45:31,916
Who will accompany me?

936
01:45:32,875 --> 01:45:33,791
Come.

937
01:45:34,583 --> 01:45:36,166
No, Erum.

938
01:45:36,708 --> 01:45:37,708
Not you.

939
01:45:42,375 --> 01:45:44,458
How can she?

940
01:45:58,333 --> 01:45:59,500
Yes.

941
01:46:00,916 --> 01:46:02,750
You are right, Isha.

942
01:46:04,041 --> 01:46:05,250
How can she go?

943
01:46:07,458 --> 01:46:08,708
When my wife was alive,

944
01:46:10,166 --> 01:46:11,666
this girl would massage her feet,

945
01:46:13,375 --> 01:46:15,791
comb her hair.

946
01:46:17,458 --> 01:46:19,083
When she was burning with fever,

947
01:46:19,708 --> 01:46:22,875
she stayed up with her all night.

948
01:46:23,916 --> 01:46:27,291
When she threw up,
this girl cleaned it up.

949
01:46:27,958 --> 01:46:32,541
She has fed her with her hands,
like a mother feeds her child.

950
01:46:32,875 --> 01:46:38,000
Were any of you,
well-meaning relatives, there for her?

951
01:46:43,083 --> 01:46:45,333
And now, when she is gone.

952
01:46:45,833 --> 01:46:48,875
How can this girl bathe her dead body?

953
01:47:05,500 --> 01:47:07,916
Erum is Jahan Ara's and my daughter.

954
01:47:10,375 --> 01:47:13,041
She will be part of her mother's funeral.

955
01:47:15,458 --> 01:47:20,041
And those who have a problem
can stay back.

956
01:47:21,541 --> 01:47:23,166
She is definitely coming along.

957
01:47:57,208 --> 01:47:58,250
<span style="style.default_1">Hello, Mehr!</span>

958
01:47:58,916 --> 01:47:59,958
What happened, darling?

959
01:48:07,416 --> 01:48:08,416
<span style="style.default_1">Hasan...</span>

960
01:48:17,083 --> 01:48:19,791
<span style="style.default_1">I too, thought about what happened.</span>

961
01:48:20,458 --> 01:48:22,708
<span style="style.default_1">Mehr, I have always loved you</span>

962
01:48:22,791 --> 01:48:24,250
<span style="style.default_1">but I just didn't express it enough.</span>

963
01:48:25,041 --> 01:48:27,458
I have made a big mistake.

964
01:48:38,791 --> 01:48:40,291
First, come here.

965
01:48:54,666 --> 01:48:56,958
I feel that I have finished.

966
01:50:00,416 --> 01:50:01,458
What?

967
01:50:26,708 --> 01:50:28,166
Say something. What's wrong?

968
01:50:44,416 --> 01:50:45,458
Today?

969
01:50:47,291 --> 01:50:48,666
But it's my day off today.

970
01:50:54,916 --> 01:50:55,958
Okay!

971
01:50:56,416 --> 01:50:57,791
I'll be there in 30 minutes.

972
01:51:03,583 --> 01:51:06,083
Where are you going?
Can I come along today?

973
01:51:06,416 --> 01:51:07,916
What will you do there?

974
01:51:08,083 --> 01:51:09,833
At least let me talk to them.

975
01:51:09,916 --> 01:51:10,833
No!

976
01:51:10,958 --> 01:51:12,291
Stay home.

977
01:51:13,041 --> 01:51:15,083
You don't need this blood-sucking job.

978
01:51:16,166 --> 01:51:18,666
Life is hell there.

979
01:51:21,125 --> 01:51:22,375
Let's go, Kulsoom.

980
01:51:22,458 --> 01:51:23,625
Table number three.

981
01:51:23,750 --> 01:51:25,416
It's a special request.

982
01:51:26,791 --> 01:51:28,458
Make her look like Sri Devi.

983
01:51:33,583 --> 01:51:34,625
Which film?

984
01:51:35,583 --> 01:51:37,291
<span style="style.default_1">Mr. India</span>, dear.

985
01:51:38,375 --> 01:51:39,458
Hurry up.

986
01:51:43,500 --> 01:51:44,583
Hello, miss.

987
01:51:46,208 --> 01:51:47,208
Who are you?

988
01:51:47,291 --> 01:51:48,375
I'm Pinky.

989
01:51:48,791 --> 01:51:50,541
-Pinky?
-Yes.

990
01:51:50,791 --> 01:51:53,041
-How are you, Pinky?
-I'm fine. And you?

991
01:51:53,125 --> 01:51:54,000
I'm also fine.

992
01:51:54,166 --> 01:51:55,333
She's my cousin.

993
01:51:55,541 --> 01:51:57,541
She came to see me
and she was about to leave.

994
01:51:57,708 --> 01:52:00,208
Shall I talk to him about the job?

995
01:52:00,291 --> 01:52:01,958
Don't keep the customers waiting.

996
01:52:03,458 --> 01:52:04,333
Go.

997
01:52:06,250 --> 01:52:08,000
-Pinky, what will you have?
-No, I'm okay...

998
01:52:08,125 --> 01:52:10,625
-Tea? Cola?
-No.

999
01:52:10,708 --> 01:52:12,208
-I'm fine. Thank you.
-Have something.

1000
01:52:14,083 --> 01:52:16,500
I was wondering
if you can train me for the salon.

1001
01:52:16,583 --> 01:52:17,916
Train for the salon?

1002
01:52:18,916 --> 01:52:20,625
She wants to be trained for the salon.

1003
01:52:20,916 --> 01:52:22,875
Kulsoom, shall we teach her?

1004
01:52:23,875 --> 01:52:26,458
Maybe she'll become as good as you.

1005
01:52:28,083 --> 01:52:29,416
We will definitely train you.

1006
01:52:33,166 --> 01:52:37,000
I trained Kulsoom too.

1007
01:52:38,916 --> 01:52:39,791
Okay.

1008
01:52:40,750 --> 01:52:42,791
-So, you really want to learn?
-Yes, I do.

1009
01:52:43,333 --> 01:52:44,875
Timmy will train you.

1010
01:52:44,958 --> 01:52:45,958
Right, Timmy?

1011
01:52:46,083 --> 01:52:47,875
Of course, I will.

1012
01:52:48,458 --> 01:52:52,458
Can I quickly go and see Kulsoom?
Then we can begin.

1013
01:52:53,625 --> 01:52:54,958
-You want to see her?
-Yes.

1014
01:54:05,750 --> 01:54:09,083
I knew you would freak out.

1015
01:54:17,291 --> 01:54:19,083
Sometimes you don't have a choice...

1016
01:54:20,958 --> 01:54:22,291
to pick between right and wrong.

1017
01:54:24,083 --> 01:54:26,208
Life doesn't give that chance to everyone.

1018
01:54:29,791 --> 01:54:31,958
When I was drowning in my misfortunes,

1019
01:54:32,750 --> 01:54:35,000
I grabbed the only opportunity
I saw at that time...

1020
01:54:35,958 --> 01:54:37,166
without thinking.

1021
01:54:40,708 --> 01:54:42,958
At least my baby had something to eat...

1022
01:54:44,875 --> 01:54:46,208
But somewhere along the way,

1023
01:54:47,500 --> 01:54:49,208
as I started giving my child...

1024
01:54:49,875 --> 01:54:51,958
the things he deserved
like good education,

1025
01:54:54,208 --> 01:54:55,916
I stopped feeling guilty.

1026
01:54:57,291 --> 01:54:58,416
Your son...

1027
01:54:59,208 --> 01:55:00,250
Does he know what you do?

1028
01:55:02,666 --> 01:55:04,208
What if you lose him?

1029
01:55:05,750 --> 01:55:07,041
If that happens...

1030
01:55:10,958 --> 01:55:12,541
then to hell with him...

1031
01:55:14,333 --> 01:55:15,833
And this education...

1032
01:55:16,625 --> 01:55:18,791
that couldn't teach him
to value his mother's sacrifice.

1033
01:55:21,666 --> 01:55:23,125
What is wrong with what I do?

1034
01:55:24,416 --> 01:55:26,041
I just dance for men.

1035
01:55:26,625 --> 01:55:28,083
What about your elite boss ladies?

1036
01:55:28,583 --> 01:55:31,166
Don't they dance to the same songs?

1037
01:55:31,708 --> 01:55:34,083
With other men. Do men not ogle at them?

1038
01:55:37,208 --> 01:55:38,916
It's my work, that's it.

1039
01:55:43,208 --> 01:55:45,000
Have I murdered anyone?

1040
01:55:46,500 --> 01:55:48,041
Have I duped anyone?

1041
01:55:48,125 --> 01:55:49,750
Have I robbed anyone?

1042
01:55:55,958 --> 01:55:57,500
Please don't cry.

1043
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:00,000
Sorry.

1044
01:56:02,416 --> 01:56:03,541
Okay, listen.

1045
01:56:07,083 --> 01:56:08,708
Look at yourself.

1046
01:56:09,791 --> 01:56:11,541
You've come such a long way.

1047
01:56:12,208 --> 01:56:13,500
Can you go back to your old life?

1048
01:56:19,375 --> 01:56:22,458
Decide what you have to do,
who you want to be.

1049
01:56:22,541 --> 01:56:24,041
Life is a bitch.

1050
01:56:24,625 --> 01:56:26,791
You have to stop being afraid of it.

1051
01:58:37,916 --> 01:58:39,125
<span style="style.default_1">Dear ma'am.</span>

1052
01:58:40,125 --> 01:58:42,041
<span style="style.default_1">Sorry about the other day.</span>

1053
01:58:42,750 --> 01:58:44,666
<span style="style.default_1">I panicked when I saw you.</span>

1054
01:58:46,333 --> 01:58:49,333
<span style="style.default_1">Whether you believe or not,
I do miss you a lot.</span>

1055
01:58:51,375 --> 01:58:52,916
<span style="style.default_1">I've even read your book.</span>

1056
01:58:54,833 --> 01:58:57,166
<span style="style.default_1">I didn't understand it completely
but I liked it anyway.</span>

1057
01:58:59,666 --> 01:59:02,000
<span style="style.default_1">It seems you are no longer
afraid of yourself.</span>

1058
01:59:04,583 --> 01:59:07,458
<span style="style.default_1">As for me, I'm fine. I'm happy.</span>

1059
01:59:07,541 --> 01:59:08,541
<span style="style.default_1">Working hard and well...</span>

1060
01:59:08,625 --> 01:59:09,833
<span style="style.default_1">Just getting on with it.</span>

1061
01:59:12,541 --> 01:59:18,541
<span style="style.default_1">Ma'am, I know that you and sir have been
searching for me for a while now.</span>

1062
01:59:19,708 --> 01:59:22,041
<span style="style.default_1">That's why I'm writing this letter.</span>

1063
01:59:24,166 --> 01:59:26,208
<span style="style.default_1">Ma'am, please don't look for me anymore.</span>

1064
01:59:29,291 --> 01:59:31,291
<span style="style.default_1">I know what you're thinking.</span>

1065
01:59:32,958 --> 01:59:35,208
<span style="style.default_1">But I'm not upset with you.</span>

1066
01:59:38,916 --> 01:59:40,666
<span style="style.default_1">You've taught me a lot.</span>

1067
01:59:42,791 --> 01:59:44,291
<span style="style.default_1">And for that I'm truly grateful.</span>

1068
01:59:45,375 --> 01:59:48,083
<span style="style.default_1">Some things are meant
to be admired from afar.</span>

1069
01:59:50,125 --> 01:59:52,416
<span style="style.default_1">You go close and it's just not the same.</span>

1070
02:00:00,833 --> 02:00:02,833
<span style="style.default_1">We cannot go back, ma'am...</span>

1071
02:00:04,958 --> 02:00:07,458
<span style="style.default_1">because I am no longer the person
you are looking for.</span>

1072
02:00:09,416 --> 02:00:10,625
<span style="style.default_1">But I pray to God</span>

1073
02:00:10,708 --> 02:00:14,208
<span style="style.default_1">that you, sir and Ahad always stay happy.</span>

1074
02:00:18,666 --> 02:00:19,708
<span style="style.default_1">Pinky.</span>

1075
02:00:52,708 --> 02:00:57,166
<span style="style.default_1">When I chose</span>

1076
02:00:57,750 --> 02:01:01,458
<span style="style.default_1">Self-belief for myself</span>

1077
02:01:03,416 --> 02:01:08,083
<span style="style.default_1">I became</span>

1078
02:01:08,166 --> 02:01:09,541
<span style="style.default_1">A better version of myself</span>

1079
02:02:26,625 --> 02:02:29,125
<span style="style.default_1">After coming here,
I learned the local language.</span>

1080
02:02:29,250 --> 02:02:32,833
<span style="style.default_1">After coming here,
I have pursued further studies.</span>

1081
02:02:33,166 --> 02:02:34,458
<span style="style.default_1">I've trained myself in ILS.</span>

1082
02:02:39,583 --> 02:02:42,083
<span style="style.default_1">And I've made some progress every year.</span>

1083
02:02:45,333 --> 02:02:48,875
<span style="style.default_1">I've got wings to fly.</span>

1084
02:02:48,958 --> 02:02:50,916
<span style="style.default_1">In Dubai, a woman can grow.</span>

1085
02:03:39,833 --> 02:03:42,750
<span style="style.default_1">I am traveling</span>

1086
02:03:42,833 --> 02:03:46,625
<span style="style.default_1">Without any destination</span>

1087
02:03:48,750 --> 02:03:50,958
<span style="style.default_1">I am somewhere</span>

1088
02:03:51,291 --> 02:03:56,750
<span style="style.default_1">And my heart is somewhere else</span>

1089
02:03:57,375 --> 02:04:04,375
<span style="style.default_1">I am traveling without any destination</span>

1090
02:04:06,041 --> 02:04:13,041
<span style="style.default_1">I am somewhere
And my heart is somewhere else</span>

1091
02:04:14,916 --> 02:04:19,083
<span style="style.default_1">There are a few hopes for a bright future</span>
