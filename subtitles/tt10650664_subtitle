I'm stumbled again.

345
00:20:00,089 --> 00:20:01,649
By elder brother died in his childhood.

346
00:20:02,137 --> 00:20:04,153
My dad likes my younger brother very much.

347
00:20:04,353 --> 00:20:06,240
That's why even after he
got into a love marriage...

348
00:20:06,264 --> 00:20:07,028
he didn't stop him.

349
00:20:07,228 --> 00:20:09,075
But the woman who my
younger brother got married to,

350
00:20:09,099 --> 00:20:11,208
didn't behave properly
in the house even for a single day.

351
00:20:11,232 --> 00:20:13,855
When my dad went into a coma
after the accident.

352
00:20:14,557 --> 00:20:16,640
She proposed sharing the property then.

353
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:20,141
Saying what's the guarantee that
a person in coma will be back?

354
00:20:20,341 --> 00:20:24,283
Then I left the property to him
and took my father to the city.

355
00:20:24,483 --> 00:20:27,524
The bike too stayed along
with the property left.

356
00:20:27,724 --> 00:20:29,370
He is in Pochampally now.

357
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:31,675
Since 20 years of the property sharing,

358
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:33,035
we didn't talk to each other.

359
00:20:34,029 --> 00:20:35,029
(SIGHS)

360
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:40,982
Hey, don't say this to
Priya to gain her sympathy.

361
00:20:41,863 --> 00:20:44,881
I don't win with sympathy.
I'll win happily.

362
00:20:45,081 --> 00:20:46,081
Oh!

363
00:20:54,222 --> 00:20:55,222
What did sir say?

364
00:20:56,175 --> 00:20:58,539
He said if you talk with me,
he'll fire you.

365
00:20:58,743 --> 00:21:00,056
- Move!
- Keep them aside.

366
00:21:00,156 --> 00:21:01,469
First tell me what my dad told you?

367
00:21:01,493 --> 00:21:04,588
He gave me a challenge in which he will
lose. Be ready to console him.

368
00:21:12,395 --> 00:21:15,205
Your father in law found
a great lamb in you!

369
00:21:16,226 --> 00:21:18,306
By the way he should give
dowry to your marriage but,

370
00:21:18,645 --> 00:21:19,864
why he is asking you a bike?

371
00:21:20,091 --> 00:21:21,454
It's not dowry dude.

372
00:21:21,654 --> 00:21:24,482
It's the condition that my father-in-law
kept to get her daughter married to me.

373
00:21:24,506 --> 00:21:26,306
Why does he need the
Rajdoot at this age dude?

374
00:21:26,373 --> 00:21:27,633
He says that's for his father.

375
00:21:27,921 --> 00:21:29,921
I doubt if he can ride it,
and it's for his father?

376
00:21:36,501 --> 00:21:37,501
Come on let's ask.

377
00:21:38,194 --> 00:21:40,714
What is he doing? He seems to be
noticing his phone than people!

378
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:42,584
Brother do you have Devadoot here?

379
00:21:43,417 --> 00:21:45,229
- Rajdoot!
- Yeah, that's what.

380
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:47,103
Brother do you have Rajdoot bike here?

381
00:21:47,362 --> 00:21:49,322
Where you would find those
bikes nowadays brother?

382
00:21:49,892 --> 00:21:51,213
Ok, where are the old bikes?

383
00:21:51,413 --> 00:21:52,533
Look for them there brother.

384
00:21:52,674 --> 00:21:54,346
Oh no! I've missed the 'chicken dinner'.

385
00:21:54,715 --> 00:21:55,897
- PubG!

386
00:21:56,713 --> 00:21:58,420

387
00:21:58,748 --> 00:22:00,348
This is perfect dude, fixed.

388
00:22:01,051 --> 00:22:02,341
Hey, but it's not Rajdoot dude!

389
00:22:02,541 --> 00:22:05,788
Hey, like they are copying Hindi
songs changing the tune a bit.

390
00:22:06,489 --> 00:22:08,664
Similarly he too
changed the bike a bit dude.

391
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:10,861
Hey,
do you understand what you are talking?

392
00:22:11,329 --> 00:22:14,302
A person who has no chance
of losing would win for sure.

393
00:22:14,596 --> 00:22:18,057
But a person who has no chance
of winning will try not to lose.

394
00:22:19,113 --> 00:22:21,354
- What does that mean?
- I'll show you tomorrow.

395
00:22:21,554 --> 00:22:22,567
I am waiting.

396
00:22:42,932 --> 00:22:45,163
Uncle,
if you give work to a determined person,

397
00:22:45,363 --> 00:22:47,407
he can even grow hair even on a bald head.

398
00:22:47,607 --> 00:22:49,578
- Huh?
- Hey, not you man, you go.

399
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:51,932

400
00:22:52,132 --> 00:22:54,722

Hey, where is Priya?
Is she packing her bag?

404
00:23:03,008 --> 00:23:05,200
- Where is the bike?
- Here it is...

suddenly and start crying!

Is this is the bike that I asked you for?

408
00:23:10,482 --> 00:23:13,328
I think your vision's blurred as
tears of happiness filled your eyes.

409
00:23:13,528 --> 00:23:14,887

Remove the decorations
and the garland at the back.

This is the bike which
I asked you to bring.

the value of a person's life,

- Uh! Uh!

515
00:29:23,706 --> 00:29:26,356
- He stays silent even if we scold him!
- We shouldn't get in at a bad time.

516
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:28,397
- Listen Ravindra, this is not at all good.
- Your leg is very worst.

517
00:29:28,421 --> 00:29:30,719
We will take this to the elders
of the village. Take care of it.

518
00:29:30,743 --> 00:29:32,303
Later you shouldn't cry for your honor.

519
00:29:33,251 --> 00:29:34,709
How many times should I come for money?

520
00:29:34,733 --> 00:29:36,813
We'll not move until you
pay our money the next time!

521
00:29:39,741 --> 00:29:43,479
Ah! The lyrics in Tamil
films are different dude!

522
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:46,012
Ain't it?
That's why I am playing a Hindi song.

523
00:29:46,212 --> 00:29:47,328
- Huh?
- Yes.

524
00:29:47,951 --> 00:29:48,951
Oh!

525
00:29:50,928 --> 00:29:52,911
I'll cease your house
if you don't pay back.

526
00:29:53,111 --> 00:29:54,645
How many times do we visit you?

527
00:29:54,845 --> 00:29:56,797
- Do you know to give money?
- Have you finished your mess?

528
00:29:56,821 --> 00:29:58,959
We'll be on our work if you go out.

529
00:29:59,863 --> 00:30:00,911
- Hmm...
- Hell with them!

530
00:30:01,356 --> 00:30:03,036
They don't have any shame whatever we say.

531
00:30:05,113 --> 00:30:06,353
Let's wait for a few more days.

532
00:30:06,456 --> 00:30:08,256
Else we shall put it
before the village heads.

533
00:30:08,327 --> 00:30:10,599
Yeah, they will tell the justice.

534
00:30:15,318 --> 00:30:17,139
He's taken loans and
bought these handlooms.

535
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:19,350
Don't know where he'd
sell the sarees he weaves!

536
00:30:21,811 --> 00:30:23,544
Who are you? What do you want?

537
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:25,391
They'd ask you money. Can you give them?

538
00:30:26,245 --> 00:30:27,404
He's asking as if he would

539
00:30:27,716 --> 00:30:29,479
- I'm Mr. Rao's son's...
- What?

540
00:30:30,062 --> 00:30:31,439
Are you my brother's son?

541
00:30:32,688 --> 00:30:35,173
Has my brother sent you? Wait son...

542

(SIGHS)

543
00:30:37,023 --> 00:30:38,863
Doesn't anyone care to
listen the entire thing?

544
00:30:39,047 --> 00:30:40,927
Both of them don't talk
since the past 20 years.

545
00:30:41,282 --> 00:30:43,002
Oh! So no one can stop us here too.

546
00:30:43,202 --> 00:30:43,955
- Yeah.
- All the best!

547
00:30:44,155 --> 00:30:45,356
There he is...

548
00:30:45,857 --> 00:30:47,263
- Sit down...
- That's okay.

549
00:30:47,463 --> 00:30:48,961
I'm here on an urgent work.

550
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:53,208
Well, I've heard you have a Rajdhoot...

551
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:58,454
Why? Is your father jealous that
we both are roaming around on it?

552
00:30:58,904 --> 00:31:00,624
- As if it's a Mercedes Benz!
- That's what.

553
00:31:01,016 --> 00:31:03,741
Anyways, where is it?
He mortgaged it long back.

554
00:31:04,184 --> 00:31:05,184
Mortgaged it?

555
00:31:05,298 --> 00:31:06,875
(GROANS) (GIRL GASPS)

556
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:10,605
Hey! Did you react so much back then?
I didn't notice!

557
00:31:10,805 --> 00:31:13,507
I shut my mouth as I couldn't
find anything to hit him.

558
00:31:13,937 --> 00:31:15,038
What did you do then?

559
00:31:15,368 --> 00:31:16,412
Why would you mortgage it?

560
00:31:16,612 --> 00:31:19,547
Our loans can't be paid back
even if we mortgage our house.

561
00:31:19,747 --> 00:31:20,796
It's just a bike!

562
00:31:20,996 --> 00:31:22,719
How could you mortgage it so easily?

563
00:31:23,068 --> 00:31:24,828
Wouldn't you think once
before mortgaging it?

564
00:31:24,921 --> 00:31:27,332
You haven't motgaged a bike.
You've mortgaged a life!

565
00:31:27,532 --> 00:31:28,251
Huh?

566
00:31:28,451 --> 00:31:29,904
Er... okay it's a bike.

567
00:31:32,741 --> 00:31:34,194
Anyway you... where's she?

568
00:31:34,669 --> 00:31:36,204
You can't understand.

569
00:31:37,412 --> 00:31:39,423
You'll never understand
the value of an item.

570
00:31:40,611 --> 00:31:42,934
Come...
they'll mortgage you too if you're here.

571
00:31:43,134 --> 00:31:44,141
Son!

572
00:31:46,248 --> 00:31:47,248
Why did you stop?

573
00:31:47,555 --> 00:31:49,399
Who the hell are they
to mortgage the bike?

574
00:31:49,599 --> 00:31:51,039
That's why they are living this way.

575
00:31:51,628 --> 00:31:53,508
What would happen if we
don't take the bike now?

576
00:31:53,712 --> 00:31:56,824
Your father-in-law bashed you black
and blue for getting a fake bike.

577
00:31:57,024 --> 00:31:59,388
Not black and blue.
He just slapped me once!

578
00:31:59,588 --> 00:32:01,486
Yeah!
Your ego prevents you to accept the truth!

579
00:32:01,909 --> 00:32:05,527
Imagine what happens if your Father-in-law
comes to know the bike isn't there?

580
00:32:06,444 --> 00:32:08,953
FATHER-IN-LAW AND HIS FATHER

581
00:32:11,503 --> 00:32:12,503
What are you looking at?

582
00:32:12,678 --> 00:32:14,110
We don't have any option. Come.

583
00:32:14,801 --> 00:32:17,308
I told you!
You wouldn't understand unless you imagine.

584
00:32:18,619 --> 00:32:20,782
Come. He is sitting sadly.

585
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:21,953
As him.

586
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:25,200
Where did you mortgage the bike?

587
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,626
Why? Would you free it paying money?

588
00:32:27,826 --> 00:32:29,786
Please tell us the address
and we'll deal with it.

589
00:32:29,915 --> 00:32:33,461
When no one who knew about your uncle
in the neighboring villages didn't,

590
00:32:33,661 --> 00:32:35,077
he mortgaged it at Mahadevapuram.

591
00:32:35,652 --> 00:32:37,091
- Mahadeva...
- Mahadevapuram?

592
00:32:37,648 --> 00:32:38,743
Where is that?

593
00:32:38,943 --> 00:32:42,362
It is located 100 kilometres from here.
Near Khammam.

594
00:32:43,094 --> 00:32:45,323
- Ah!
- Come. It's 100 kilometres!

595
00:32:45,656 --> 00:32:48,324
No one has a second wife so far too. Damn!

596
00:32:49,441 --> 00:32:50,441
Son...

597
00:32:51,462 --> 00:32:53,163
You came here after so long.

598
00:32:53,461 --> 00:32:55,991
Don't you feel like asking
'How are you uncle'?

599
00:32:58,294 --> 00:33:00,428
What's there to ask?
Everyone has their own troubles.

600
00:33:00,739 --> 00:33:02,357
- I'll go.
- Don't say go.

601
00:33:02,927 --> 00:33:04,327
You should say I'll come back soon.

602
00:33:04,526 --> 00:33:05,560
Why'd I come back?

00:33:21,871 --> 00:33:22,871
What happened dude?

606
00:33:24,053 --> 00:33:25,894
The fuel is exhausted. What do we do now?

607
00:33:26,094 --> 00:33:27,526
Oh no!

We are at the fuel station dude.

609
00:33:38,317 --> 00:33:39,826
Would he come here and fill the fuel?

610
00:33:40,115 --> 00:33:41,115
Push it!

611
00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:43,713

00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:54,516
What's with him? Is he crying as someoone
hit him or as he is unable to hit someone?

615
00:33:56,775 --> 00:33:58,567
Why do we bother who's crying for what?

Do you accept cards? (SOBS)

You tell me what to do then.

- You tell me.
- That's not my plate of biryani.

since the morning why I'm crying.

since the morning. So the kindness.

accepts but her father doesn't?

If the people who are in such
worst situations are so happy.

663
00:36:23,683 --> 00:36:24,760
How happy should I be?

664
00:36:25,195 --> 00:36:27,315
- I'll not cry sir!
- How could he say that about you?

- I'll send you the money once I reach home.
- Eh!

He write it on the rear of the auto.

- Okay? Bye.
- Sir!

671
00:36:38,636 --> 00:36:40,286
I just filled the fuel in this bike sir.

672
00:36:40,441 --> 00:36:42,876
But you filled my heart with courage sir.

673
00:36:43,301 --> 00:36:45,719
It's someone else if not this girl.
Or someone else altogether!

674
00:36:45,743 --> 00:36:47,183
It doesn't matter sir. Go ahead sir!

675
00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:49,397
- One thing bro.
- Tell me sir...

676
00:36:49,694 --> 00:36:52,787
Having so much fuel handy,
you didn't think of suicide...

You are the real lover bro.

678
00:36:55,779 --> 00:36:57,019
- Okay, get on man.
- Start now!

00:36:57,772 --> 00:36:58,856

It's dried up...

- Brother!
- Yeah.

- Heard there is a Seth called Sundar Lal.
- Yeah.

684
00:37:16,203 --> 00:37:17,203

00:42:54,015 --> 00:42:55,375
Did he say anything
about the bike?

777
00:42:55,561 --> 00:42:56,914
He narrated a big story.

778

2 lakh grains. What's the summary?

What would it be... he waited
for 3 years after he pawned it.

780
00:43:05,429 --> 00:43:08,109
When he didn't return,
he sold the bike.

- Sold?
- Yes.

that transaction is that,

the guy who bought that bike gave
only half of the money. Bloody miser!

785
00:43:20,392 --> 00:43:21,941
Did he say about the
whereabouts of that guy?

786
00:43:21,950 --> 00:43:24,310
He said that the buyer is
residing somewhere near Nuziveedu.

787
00:43:24,696 --> 00:43:26,096

14 years. Subtract 7 years from that.

1028
00:55:36,304 --> 00:55:38,460
You bought a bike
7 years ago, didn't you?

1029
00:55:38,538 --> 00:55:40,018
- Where is it?
- What are you talking?

1030
00:55:40,973 --> 00:55:41,973
How do I look to you?

1031
00:55:42,108 --> 00:55:42,675
What do you mean?

1032
00:55:42,735 --> 00:55:44,108
- It's our mistake.
- Then, what?

1033
00:55:44,244 --> 00:55:45,956
I'm a thief and I have some ethics.

1034
00:55:46,241 --> 00:55:47,043
He said a terrible thing.

1035
00:55:47,102 --> 00:55:49,131
- What did I say?
- You ask what you said?

1036
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,418
How can he ask if I had
bought a bike?

1037
00:55:51,442 --> 00:55:53,538
Do I seem like I buy things? It's in
our clan that we don't buy things.

1038
00:55:53,556 --> 00:55:54,779
- I have stolen it.
- Sorry, brother.

1039
00:55:54,803 --> 00:55:56,815
Sorry? After all the blabbering?

1040
00:55:57,235 --> 00:55:59,714
Hey Seth, is this the guy
whom you sold the bike?

1041
00:55:59,839 --> 00:56:00,403
Haa...

1042
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:01,164
Who is he?

1043
00:56:01,388 --> 00:56:02,828
He is the one who sold you the bike.

1044
00:56:05,539 --> 00:56:07,806
- Ah...
- Whoa!

1045
00:56:08,062 --> 00:56:10,474
Er... Yes, he is the one...
He is the one...

1046
00:56:10,479 --> 00:56:11,974
I swear on my mother,
I bought that bike from this person.

1047
00:56:11,998 --> 00:56:13,030
Sir, I bought it from you.

1048
00:56:13,054 --> 00:56:15,526
Don't try to explain.
I will fall on your feet and plead you.

1049
00:56:15,581 --> 00:56:17,441
I bought it from you.
I bought it from you, sir.

1050
00:56:17,465 --> 00:56:19,253
That was the Rajdhoot
bike I was asking about.

1051
00:56:19,277 --> 00:56:20,797
We'll take it if you tell where it is.

1052
00:56:24,921 --> 00:56:27,856
Hey, why did the seller and the
buyer put the same expression?

1053
00:56:27,993 --> 00:56:29,273
What a bike it is!

1054
00:56:29,285 --> 00:56:31,070
Didn't you say a while ago
that you have recognised it?

1055
00:56:31,094 --> 00:56:33,124
Shucks! I mean it is a dirty bike.

1056
00:56:33,186 --> 00:56:35,436
I've committed many burglaries
and I've stolen many bikes.

1057
00:56:35,454 --> 00:56:38,269
But for the first time,
I was caught due to that bike.

1058
00:56:38,730 --> 00:56:39,329
Why so?

1059
00:56:39,521 --> 00:56:40,969
You're the reason for that
bike to have such movement.

1060
00:56:40,993 --> 00:56:42,785
You're also the one who
forced me to buy it.

1061
00:56:43,546 --> 00:56:44,546
Huh!

1062
00:56:44,841 --> 00:56:46,985
- I...
- Huh...

1063
00:56:48,467 --> 00:56:49,664
That's not possible now.

1064
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:51,556
If you start now, it would take a week
to finish it. Close it over there.

1065
00:56:51,578 --> 00:56:52,853
If you want, do it from your mouth.

1066
00:56:52,877 --> 00:56:53,877
You continue...

1067
00:56:54,328 --> 00:56:55,248
How can he do it from the mouth?

1068
00:56:55,324 --> 00:56:57,684
It's his burden.
Tell us where the bike is.

1069
00:56:58,276 --> 00:56:59,276
That bike...

1070
00:57:00,395 --> 00:57:02,410
One day, when I was going on that
bike after committing a theft,

1071
00:57:02,434 --> 00:57:04,790
- He might fall on you. Be careful.
- No, it would take a lot of time.

1072
00:57:04,814 --> 00:57:07,100
When I was going on that
bike after committing a theft,

1073
00:57:07,447 --> 00:57:08,734
I saw an old man.

1074
00:57:09,171 --> 00:57:11,678
I saw a glittering silver
waist ornament on him.

1075
00:57:11,934 --> 00:57:14,661
I pulled that waist ornament thinking what
he would be doing with that at this age.

1076
00:57:14,685 --> 00:57:17,763
The old man fell down and the
people around me started bashing me.

1077
00:57:18,007 --> 00:57:20,151
And it was my ill-fate that even the
policemen came over there (SIREN WAILING)

1078
00:57:20,175 --> 00:57:21,175
and jailed me.

1079
00:57:21,316 --> 00:57:22,482
They seized that bike.

1080
00:57:22,974 --> 00:57:26,536
I got caught for the first time in my
burglary career due to that bike.

1081
00:57:26,612 --> 00:57:29,128
So I thought to take revenge
on that, no matter whatsoever.

1082
00:57:29,413 --> 00:57:32,468
And, I abandoned that
bike there itself.

1083
00:57:33,238 --> 00:57:35,914
- I can't get it.
- I know.

1084
00:57:36,158 --> 00:57:37,394
Where is that bike now?

1085
00:57:37,788 --> 00:57:39,918
It is might be happily taking
rest in the police station.

1086
00:57:39,942 --> 00:57:40,942
Which police station?

1087
00:57:41,685 --> 00:57:43,445
The accident took place on
the Rajahmundry's highway.

1088
00:57:43,449 --> 00:57:45,129
That place falls under
Kotipally police station.

1089
00:57:45,153 --> 00:57:47,624
- According to Kotipally police station.
- Kotipally?

1090
00:57:48,336 --> 00:57:49,724
Why are you stretching it
instead of telling it straight away?

1091
00:57:49,748 --> 00:57:50,832
He says it is Kotipally.

1092
00:57:51,180 --> 00:57:52,860
Should I go now to
Kotipally for that bike?

1093
00:57:52,897 --> 00:57:56,144
- Basically, I'm a man of ethics.
- Don't. Tell me what you want.

1094
00:57:56,244 --> 00:57:58,925
- (RETCHES)
- Sir, I bow to you.

1095
00:57:59,197 --> 00:58:00,906
You won't get it. It has time.

1096
00:58:02,050 --> 00:58:03,522
I told you that I'm a
man of ethics, didn't I?

1097
00:58:03,546 --> 00:58:05,111
- Why do you keep telling that again?
- So...

1098
00:58:05,135 --> 00:58:08,414
I wanted to pay you
as you have helped me.

1099
00:58:09,110 --> 00:58:10,110
I don't need money.

1100
00:58:10,377 --> 00:58:12,817
Give it to him because you have
evaded payment to him earlier.

1101
00:58:14,036 --> 00:58:15,465
Drop him at his village carefully.

1102
00:58:15,740 --> 00:58:17,077
Okay... Okay...

1103
00:58:19,909 --> 00:58:20,909
Hey...

1104
00:58:23,228 --> 00:58:27,319
- Brother, do you need some money.
- (STARTS ENGINE) No... Go away.

Hey, look at those seized bikes.

1109
00:58:57,246 --> 00:58:59,316
I'm sure that we'll find the
bike that we're looking for.

1110
00:58:59,340 --> 00:59:02,176
I don't know. I don't believe unless
I see it. We've been searching for it.

(MUSIC)

00:59:58,266 --> 01:00:02,475
Hey, you will recognise it even if it is
in this place. Let's go inside and inquire.

1113

- Sir... Don't hit me... Please...
- Tell the truth...

- Sir... Sir...
- You...

- The CI is on the line.
- I will kill you if you don't the truth.

1116
01:00:14,256 --> 01:00:17,068
Hello... Eh... He is coming?

1117
01:00:17,560 --> 01:00:19,655
Hey, the corporator is arriving here.
Take off those ladders and other things.

1118
01:00:19,679 --> 01:00:22,127
Hey...
Did he tell anything about my son?

1119

He will tell it. I'm on that work, sir.

1120
01:00:23,867 --> 01:00:25,543
- He will tell it.
- Where is he? Tell me.

1121
01:00:25,609 --> 01:00:26,050
He's inside, sir.

- That bugger...
- Sir... Sir...

- Where did you hide my son?
- Sir... Please don't hit me.

- Tell me... I will kill you...
- Sir... Sir...

running away. Look there.

- Hey!

01:00:37,962 --> 01:00:39,383
- Hey, don't harm him.
- Don't come closer.

01:00:39,407 --> 01:00:40,487
- Cool... Cool...
- I'll stab him if you do so.

- Don't come closer.
- Ah... Ah...

bike?-Why are just staring?

takes killing both of them.

like a kidnapper to you?

how can he even kidnap?

at this time, sir? (HONKING)

facing murder charge too.

of running away if he had kidnapped?

if we try explaining these things.

Is it?

to watch the movie The Jungle Book.

Well, you didn't kidnap him.

Is it necessary for you to threaten
him with a knife and this chase?

1179
01:02:53,864 --> 01:02:56,317
You saw the corporator.
He didn't even listen to the police.

How do you think he will listen to me?

saving my life without shooting me.

you should be thanking.

01:03:20,572 --> 01:03:21,997
Do you know any information about it?

1190
01:03:22,021 --> 01:03:26,047
Huh! Why would a bike that was
seized 6 years ago still remain here?

1191
01:03:26,770 --> 01:03:28,538
We have sold it a long time
ago fu... Forgive me, Lord.

1192
01:03:28,562 --> 01:03:29,754
(BEEPS)

1193
01:03:29,930 --> 01:03:30,715
Forgive me, Lord.

1194
01:03:30,806 --> 01:03:32,315
Sorry, sir. Did you sell it?

1195
01:03:32,318 --> 01:03:35,458
Sir, I can't take this
anymore. Arrest me.

1196
01:03:35,466 --> 01:03:37,173
And if possible,
sentence me with lifetime imprisonment.

1197
01:03:37,197 --> 01:03:38,997
He's been torturing me
by taking me to places.

1198
01:03:39,457 --> 01:03:41,785
There is no difference between the
sugarcane juice machine and him.

1199
01:03:41,809 --> 01:03:44,010
He's been squeezing my like sugarcane.

1200
01:03:44,136 --> 01:03:45,832
Hey, are you done?

1201
01:03:46,770 --> 01:03:47,980
Enough said, come sit here.

1202
01:03:48,226 --> 01:03:49,226
Come...

1203
01:03:50,057 --> 01:03:51,497
Well, who might have bought it, sir?

1204
01:03:54,421 --> 01:03:55,644
Ramaniah - Sir.

1205
01:03:57,289 --> 01:04:00,001
Heard that you seized a bike six
years ago, do you know anything about it?

1206
01:04:00,025 --> 01:04:01,877
- Sir, I will inquire... I will inquire...
- Sir... Please...

1207
01:04:01,901 --> 01:04:03,977
- Thank you, sir.
- Please file an FIR against me.

1208
01:04:04,053 --> 01:04:06,304
It is alright if they put me in jail
for 2 to 3 years. I will be in jail.

1209
01:04:06,308 --> 01:04:07,388
- Come...
- I won't go, sir.

1210
01:04:09,671 --> 01:04:11,633
- What is the brand of the bike?
- Rajdhoot, sir.

1211
01:04:12,371 --> 01:04:15,139
- It is a 1980 model, isn't it?
- Yeah... Yeah... That one.

1212
01:04:15,935 --> 01:04:17,735
- Do you know about it?
- I know it very well.

1213
01:04:17,894 --> 01:04:21,019
Because the previous SI was
very fond of that bike.

1214
01:04:21,049 --> 01:04:24,365
He waited to buy that bike
and bought it when auctioned.

1215
01:04:24,981 --> 01:04:26,199
(SIGHS)

1216
01:04:28,049 --> 01:04:30,358
- Now, that bike...
- would be definitely with him.

1217
01:04:31,670 --> 01:04:33,414
He is presently residing at Maredivilli.

1218
01:04:33,441 --> 01:04:35,833
If you go there,
you will find that bike for sure.

1219
01:04:57,792 --> 01:05:00,055
Don't you talk anything
here. I will deal and settle.

1220
01:05:00,251 --> 01:05:01,644
- Okay?
- Alright.

1221
01:05:02,768 --> 01:05:04,452
(DOOR BELL DINGS)

1222
01:05:05,522 --> 01:05:08,202
- Why is taking so much time? Go, ring.
- What kind of person he is!

1223
01:05:10,019 --> 01:05:15,928
(DOOR BELL DINGS)

1224
01:05:17,885 --> 01:05:18,885
Aw!

1225
01:05:19,364 --> 01:05:21,545
- What's this nuisance?
- Sorry, sir.

1226
01:05:21,703 --> 01:05:23,958
Can't you wait for the person
to come after you ring the bell?

1227
01:05:23,982 --> 01:05:24,982
Sorry, sir.

1228
01:05:25,537 --> 01:05:26,325
What do you want?

1229
01:05:26,427 --> 01:05:29,180
- Sir...
- If not for him, show it for my sake.

1230
01:05:29,829 --> 01:05:30,677
Come, I will show you.

1231
01:05:30,767 --> 01:05:32,741
- Come, let's go.
- (SCREAMS)

1232

(PANTS DUE TO PAIN)

1233
01:05:35,690 --> 01:05:37,961
You are a stranger to me like him.

1234
01:05:38,180 --> 01:05:39,960
You should talk to me knowing that.

1235
01:05:40,243 --> 01:05:46,099
- Sir, I'm looking for Mr Vikas.
- WELL, MR VIKAS STAYS IN THE HOUSE NO: 98.

1236
01:05:46,297 --> 01:05:48,149
Oh! Sorry, sir. What's happening here?

1237
01:05:48,673 --> 01:05:50,897
- HEY IDIOT, THIS IS HOUSE NO: 98.
- Sir...

1238
01:05:50,997 --> 01:05:53,296
- What's this sir?
- THIS IS HOUSE NO: 98.

1239
01:05:53,641 --> 01:05:55,457
Are you ringing the
bell without knowing that?

1240
01:05:55,557 --> 01:05:57,207
- Well, who are you?
- He is my friend.

1241
01:05:57,987 --> 01:06:00,595
- What do I have to do with that?
- That's is what I'm trying to tell you.

1242
01:06:00,619 --> 01:06:01,950
It doesn't matter to you who he is.

1243
01:06:01,974 --> 01:06:03,282
Show us quickly.

1244
01:06:05,334 --> 01:06:07,795
Hey, who are you?

1245
01:06:07,887 --> 01:06:10,119
Sir, I'm son of Kala Durga, Nellore.

1246
01:06:10,131 --> 01:06:11,961
- The lane beside municipal office...
- Hey...

1247
01:06:12,046 --> 01:06:13,788
- Calm down.
- Hey, just take him away.

1248
01:06:14,028 --> 01:06:16,651
- Just take him away.
- He is lazy to drive. I have to drive him.

1249
01:06:16,678 --> 01:06:18,042
- You...
- Sir... Sir... Sir...

1250
01:06:18,215 --> 01:06:21,050
Sir, heard that you have a bike.

1251
01:06:21,126 --> 01:06:22,206
Can you show it to me once.

1252
01:06:22,422 --> 01:06:23,594
- Bike?
- Yes, sir.

1253
01:06:23,989 --> 01:06:25,503
I drive a car.

1254
01:06:25,819 --> 01:06:28,336
No, sir... There should
be a bike with you.

1255
01:06:29,198 --> 01:06:30,306
Yes, I had a bike.

1256
01:06:30,521 --> 01:06:32,268
If you give it to us, we'll go.

1257
01:06:32,385 --> 01:06:35,283
Who are you?
Why do you want my bike?

1258
01:06:35,628 --> 01:06:38,286
Sir, we came from very far.
Please, sir.

1259
01:06:38,346 --> 01:06:41,683
- Wait for 2 minutes. I will be right back.
- Sir... Sir...

1260
01:06:41,783 --> 01:06:44,047
- We came from a very far place, sir.
- Just spare two minutes, sir. Please.

1261
01:06:44,071 --> 01:06:45,835
- Will you kill me?
- Please sir... Just once.

1262
01:06:45,859 --> 01:06:48,809
(STIRRER CLANGS) Alright.
Let's go. It is in the outhouse.

1263
01:06:49,377 --> 01:06:51,126
After I reach my village,
I will send you pickle.

1264
01:06:51,147 --> 01:06:52,147
Let's go, dude.

1265
01:06:57,004 --> 01:07:01,352
You came in the early morning.
Well, how do you know about my bike?

1266
01:07:01,513 --> 01:07:03,217
Sir, please show us the bike.

1267
01:07:03,376 --> 01:07:04,811
- Please, sir.
- Please, sir... Please...

1268
01:07:04,833 --> 01:07:05,833
Oh man!

1269
01:07:06,579 --> 01:07:07,579
Dude - Yes.

1270
01:07:08,135 --> 01:07:09,639
- Congratulations!
- Thanks, dude.

1271
01:07:10,101 --> 01:07:11,421
- You'll soon get married.
- Yeah!

1272
01:07:14,750 --> 01:07:17,609
We almost got the bike. If we take
this and give it to my father-in-law...

1273
01:07:17,633 --> 01:07:19,873
- You have to give me a party, dude!
- Of course, I will.

1274
01:07:48,614 --> 01:07:50,309
It's okay. You'll be fine.

1275
01:07:50,529 --> 01:07:51,529
Don't worry.

1276
01:07:53,446 --> 01:07:55,952
- I'm also very sad.
- That's okay.

1277
01:07:56,044 --> 01:07:58,855
- It's very painful.
- That's fine!

1278
01:07:59,055 --> 01:08:00,055
Rightly served!

1279
01:08:00,610 --> 01:08:02,683
So, what did you do?

1280
01:08:03,706 --> 01:08:06,058
Ask him... If it is
questioning, they ask me.

1281
01:08:07,009 --> 01:08:10,121
What happened to us on that day
after seeing that bike is that...

1282
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:11,920
It became like that due to that accident.

1283
01:08:12,342 --> 01:08:14,022
How can it become
like that in an accident?

1284
01:08:16,194 --> 01:08:19,526
Actually... I was
overspeeding and it happened in that way.

1285
01:08:19,904 --> 01:08:22,964
Sir, can it get dismantled
into that many parts?

1286
01:08:23,049 --> 01:08:27,021
Hey, retrieving those parts after
that accident itself is a great thing.

1287
01:08:27,329 --> 01:08:28,609
Luckily, nothing happened to me.

1288
01:08:28,658 --> 01:08:30,210
Leave about yourself, sir.

1289
01:08:30,333 --> 01:08:31,853
- First, tell us about the bike.
- Yes.

1290
01:08:32,610 --> 01:08:34,330
What's there in that bike?
It is an old PPS.

1291
01:08:34,687 --> 01:08:36,198
- PPS?
- PPS?

1292
01:08:36,332 --> 01:08:37,332
What is PPS dude?

1293
01:08:37,644 --> 01:08:40,261
Sir, are you the SI who
worked at Kotipally SI?

1294
01:08:40,421 --> 01:08:40,965
Yes.

1295
01:08:41,251 --> 01:08:43,003
Didn't you buy
Rajdhoot bike in the auction?

1296
01:08:43,034 --> 01:08:43,766
Of course, I bought it.

1297
01:08:43,858 --> 01:08:45,453
Sir, I was asking about the Rajdhoot.

1298
01:08:45,629 --> 01:08:47,118
Hey, calm down.

1299
01:08:47,292 --> 01:08:49,884
You came and forced me to show the bike.

1300
01:08:50,324 --> 01:08:52,164
Did anyone of you at
least ask me for Rajdhoot?

1301
01:08:52,237 --> 01:08:54,368
Idiot! This is all because of you.
Douchebag!

1302
01:08:54,468 --> 01:08:56,237
On top of that, you didn't
allow me to prepare an omelette.

1303
01:08:56,261 --> 01:08:58,461
I will make an online
order of an omelette for you, sir.

1304
01:08:58,595 --> 01:08:59,888
Please tell us about Rajdhoot, sir.

1305
01:08:59,912 --> 01:09:02,038
His father-in-law is
torturing us day and night.

1306
01:09:02,066 --> 01:09:03,236
Yes, sir. Please.

1307
01:09:03,660 --> 01:09:05,412
My dad was very fond of Rajdhoot.

1308
01:09:06,621 --> 01:09:09,648
That's why I waited till
the auction and bought it.

1309
01:09:09,652 --> 01:09:11,677
Sir, we know the story till that point.

1310
01:09:11,796 --> 01:09:13,324
Tell us what happened after that.

1311
01:09:13,875 --> 01:09:16,063
After that,
I gave Rajdhoot to my father as a gift.

1312
01:09:16,066 --> 01:09:18,138
Hmph! You could have given
this PPS vehicle as the gift.

1313
01:09:18,153 --> 01:09:19,153
Hey!

1314
01:09:20,118 --> 01:09:22,322
Sir, call your father
and ask him to come here.

1315
01:09:22,393 --> 01:09:23,965
It is very important. Please...

1316
01:09:24,189 --> 01:09:25,189
No, it is not possible.

1317
01:09:25,908 --> 01:09:27,412
I and my father are not in talking terms.

1318
01:09:27,436 --> 01:09:29,763
Why? What does your father do?

1319
01:09:29,824 --> 01:09:31,624
Hey, what do people
generally do in a village?

1320
01:09:31,706 --> 01:09:33,543
They might be doing farming
or running a petty store.

1321
01:09:33,567 --> 01:09:34,567
What do you say, sir?

1322
01:09:34,873 --> 01:09:36,974
- Hey!
- Oh! He doesn't even farms?

1323
01:09:37,189 --> 01:09:38,824
He might have sold them
to educate his children.

1324
01:09:38,848 --> 01:09:39,297
Pity!

1325
01:09:39,389 --> 01:09:39,857
Hey!

1326
01:09:39,941 --> 01:09:40,409
Hmm...

1327
01:09:40,891 --> 01:09:42,095
Do you know who my father is?

1328
01:09:47,557 --> 01:09:49,102
Rajanna from Kadapa.

1329
01:09:49,530 --> 01:09:51,582
Hey, I understood your
father-in-law's planning.

1330
01:09:51,623 --> 01:09:54,384
It is his idea to get rid of you by
trapping to a person like Rajanna.

1331
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:57,200
What happened next?

1332
01:09:57,400 --> 01:09:59,481
Don't ask him? I will narrate it.

1333
01:10:00,084 --> 01:10:02,852
After that, our bad luck
gave us a grand welcome.

1334
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,000
Our bike broke down.

1335
01:10:05,092 --> 01:10:08,245
Then, you came to us like
a Goddess and helped us.

1336
01:10:09,209 --> 01:10:11,075
And you know what happened after that.

1337
01:10:12,842 --> 01:10:14,883
Oh! Your story is very nice.

1338
01:10:15,125 --> 01:10:16,574
It is just like the story of seven fishes.

1339
01:10:16,598 --> 01:10:19,042
When the fish is
questioned, it blames the grass.

1340
01:10:19,199 --> 01:10:21,079
When the grass is
questioned, it blames the cow.

1341
01:10:21,179 --> 01:10:23,082
When the cow is questioned,
it blames the old man.

1342
01:10:23,106 --> 01:10:24,986
- That's how your story is.
- Did you hear that?

1343
01:10:25,283 --> 01:10:27,882
Hey, she says your story
is already published.

1344
01:10:28,326 --> 01:10:30,409
Didn't they mention a
friend character in this?

1345
01:10:30,609 --> 01:10:32,901
(LAUGHS)

1346
01:10:33,107 --> 01:10:34,107
Shucks!

1347
01:10:34,563 --> 01:10:35,826
- Let's go.
- Hmm...

1348
01:10:41,956 --> 01:10:44,406
Hey... Hey... Hey... Hoarder!
Let's go, dude.

1349
01:10:45,515 --> 01:10:46,515
You...

1350
01:10:46,745 --> 01:10:49,145
- We can eat while on the way.
- Alright. Share with me some.

1351
01:10:50,221 --> 01:10:52,224
Oh! The distance from here
to Kadapa is very far.

1352
01:10:52,911 --> 01:10:54,102
I should first fill the fuel.

1353
01:10:56,155 --> 01:10:58,063
Hey, my bike is missing.

1354
01:11:00,695 --> 01:11:02,661
Bro, where is the bike
which I've parked here?

1355
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:03,808
Can't you see that board?

1356
01:11:05,562 --> 01:11:07,522
You should have told that
before I parked it here.

1357
01:11:07,638 --> 01:11:09,842
- (LAUGHS)
- Oh no!

1358
01:11:09,942 --> 01:11:12,107
Hey. Is it funny that my bike is missing?

1359
01:11:13,359 --> 01:11:14,985
Do you know how much I like my bike?

1360
01:11:15,140 --> 01:11:17,451
You would know that pain
when you lose your bike!

1361
01:11:18,266 --> 01:11:18,735
Ah!

1362
01:11:18,895 --> 01:11:21,055
It is very common in this
kind of areas to lose a bike.

1363
01:11:21,256 --> 01:11:23,578
But you are crying like a kid,

1364
01:11:23,953 --> 01:11:25,243
- that's very comedy.
- Hey, talk to her.

1365
01:11:25,267 --> 01:11:28,473
What do you want now?
Do you expect gratitude in his cry?

1366
01:11:28,916 --> 01:11:31,197
This is for the time in his
life he became very emotional.

1367
01:11:32,316 --> 01:11:33,213
Anyway, what happened now?

1368
01:11:33,313 --> 01:11:35,070
What happened?
The bike is missing.

1369
01:11:35,151 --> 01:11:36,631
- You are there, aren't you?
- Oh man!

1370
01:11:36,808 --> 01:11:39,288
What do you mean? Do you want
him to crawl to Kadapa from here?

1371
01:11:39,332 --> 01:11:41,267
Hey, consider yourself too.

1372
01:11:41,728 --> 01:11:42,728
Sorry.

1373
01:11:43,329 --> 01:11:45,009
You might have bought it 2 to 3 years ago.

1374
01:11:45,255 --> 01:11:46,925
When you react so much for that,

1375
01:11:47,117 --> 01:11:49,340
what might be the
reaction of that elderly man

1376
01:11:49,480 --> 01:11:51,280
who's been connected
with that for many years.

1377
01:11:51,905 --> 01:11:53,585
- Think about it.
- That's a correct point.

1378
01:11:53,994 --> 01:11:54,519
Hmm...

1379
01:11:54,761 --> 01:11:59,470
Alright! I will drop you on my bike till
halfway and that too if you agree for it.

1380
01:11:59,579 --> 01:12:00,861
When girls like you offer a lift,

1381
01:12:00,885 --> 01:12:02,439
the guys will readily take
it by throwing their bikes.

1382
01:12:02,463 --> 01:12:03,567
Will he deny her offer?

1383
01:12:03,980 --> 01:12:04,579
Okay. Let's go.

1384
01:12:04,773 --> 01:12:06,240
Hey, what about me?

1385
01:12:07,322 --> 01:12:08,998
Thanks for coming. Go home.

1386
01:12:09,915 --> 01:12:12,383
What do you think then? What do
you think it is, a bike or a plane?

1387
01:12:12,407 --> 01:12:14,372
How can three persons go on a bike?
Tell me.

1388
01:12:17,817 --> 01:12:18,821
Stop your imagination!

1389
01:12:20,341 --> 01:12:22,398
I asked you to stay with me for a day.

1390
01:12:22,474 --> 01:12:24,238
But why have you been
attached to me all these days?

1391
01:12:24,262 --> 01:12:26,991
Don't you have any other
work? Be responsible.

1392
01:12:27,873 --> 01:12:30,085
Go to your village and
do some worthy work.

1393
01:12:30,272 --> 01:12:32,287
This is not working with you.
Come with me.

1394
01:12:33,083 --> 01:12:35,136
- Hold on... Hold on...
- Hey, I'm used to sitting on a tank.

1395
01:12:35,160 --> 01:12:36,963
I will get adjusted by sitting
on the fuel tank of the bike.

1396
01:12:36,987 --> 01:12:39,747
- Please... Please... It is a very big bike.
- Stop... Stop...

1397
01:12:39,818 --> 01:12:41,693
- I can really adjust...
- Sir, he's my friend and has no money.

1398
01:12:41,717 --> 01:12:42,338
Lift please.

1399
01:12:42,729 --> 01:12:44,755
He is our guy. I talked
everything with him. Board it.

1400
01:12:44,779 --> 01:12:47,299
- I don't even have money.
- Hey... Just board it... Board it...

1401
01:12:47,442 --> 01:12:49,419
- Call me immediately after you reach.
- Hey, please think about it.

1402
01:12:49,443 --> 01:12:51,599
- Hey... Hey...
- Bye, dude. Happy journey.

1404
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:01,053

(VROOM)

1406
01:13:29,118 --> 01:13:31,944
Everyone knows how much I like
her except my father-in-law.

1407
01:13:33,740 --> 01:13:36,100
- He won't accept even if he knows.
- That is what it seems.

1408
01:13:36,990 --> 01:13:38,550
I will do anything for her.

1409
01:13:38,841 --> 01:13:41,241
If she calls me, I will be before
her eyes within 10 minutes.

1410
01:13:42,028 --> 01:13:43,868
She is more important to
me rather than myself.

1411
01:13:44,405 --> 01:13:47,726
Not the others... Not even me...
She is the one who believed in me first.

1412
01:13:48,237 --> 01:13:51,709
If she believes in me that I can do
certain work, I will do it for sure.

1413
01:13:51,994 --> 01:13:54,935
That's why I won't deny her anything.

1414
01:13:56,419 --> 01:13:59,919
You said she is more important
to you. That's wrong.

1415
01:14:00,201 --> 01:14:04,044
If there is someone who can love,
they should first love themselves.

1416
01:14:04,867 --> 01:14:06,567
She is very much fond of you.

1417
01:14:06,972 --> 01:14:09,398
When her father allowed you to
visit his home multiple times,

1418
01:14:09,654 --> 01:14:12,014
It means she had told her father
about you in a very great way.

1419
01:14:12,038 --> 01:14:14,702
She desires to show you
to her father in a very great way.

1420
01:14:17,500 --> 01:14:21,089
In a way how girls talk about their
fathers in a great way in their childhood,

1421
01:14:21,168 --> 01:14:24,612
Similarly, they want to talk about
their husbands in the very same way.

1422
01:14:24,885 --> 01:14:28,748
You are right. But I know more about
her family matters rather than mine.

1423
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:30,320
What do they want other than this?

1424
01:14:30,372 --> 01:14:32,584
After the marriage,
she has to come to your home.

1425
01:14:32,952 --> 01:14:35,233
So, if you don't behave properly
with your family members,

1426
01:14:35,419 --> 01:14:36,795
what would be the case of that girl?

1427
01:14:36,819 --> 01:14:41,025
You are a great lover but your
father-in-law expects a responsible person.

1428
01:14:41,111 --> 01:14:43,273
Hence, he gave you this
big responsibility.

1429

01:15:10,975 --> 01:15:11,975
Alright, then.

1432
01:15:13,446 --> 01:15:15,778
I should go in this way
and you go in that way.

1433
01:15:15,975 --> 01:15:16,975
Hmm.

1434
01:15:17,316 --> 01:15:18,996
I should tell you
something before leaving.

1435
01:15:19,718 --> 01:15:20,903
You are an awesome lover.

1436
01:15:21,569 --> 01:15:23,049
You are doing so much for your lover.

1437
01:15:23,352 --> 01:15:27,224
(SIGHS) It's okay but what would be my
position if I didn't get the bike there?

1438
01:15:27,935 --> 01:15:31,202
It's not necessary to think about
all of these before going there.

1439
01:15:31,402 --> 01:15:33,365
There is no need of
strong reasons to believe,

1440
01:15:33,805 --> 01:15:35,245
it's enough if the belief is strong.

1441
01:15:35,597 --> 01:15:38,003
Don't leave it even if there
is one per cent of a chance.

1442
01:15:38,902 --> 01:15:40,202
I know that you won't leave it.

1443
01:15:41,085 --> 01:15:42,165
You aren't a normal person.

1444
01:15:42,655 --> 01:15:45,475
You will repair not just the
vehicles but also humans.

1445
01:15:51,058 --> 01:15:52,635
- I'll see you.
- See you.

1446

Hey! Bro... Bro...

1447
01:16:26,878 --> 01:16:29,924
What's it, dude? You got neatly ready
and walking alone. Where are you going?

1448
01:16:30,197 --> 01:16:31,557
I need to go the upcoming village.

1449
01:16:31,585 --> 01:16:32,410
- Into the village?
- Hmm.

1450
01:16:32,485 --> 01:16:34,054
Did you pledge that you'd
go there by walking?

1451
01:16:34,078 --> 01:16:37,038
- No one is offering a lift to me.
- Oh, is it? Whom are you going to meet?

1452
01:16:37,216 --> 01:16:40,478
A person named Ra... Ra... Rajanna.

1453
01:16:40,678 --> 01:16:42,360
- I have some work with him.
- Work with him?

1454
01:16:42,384 --> 01:16:44,434
He will solve every problem.

1455
01:16:44,539 --> 01:16:46,711
- Is it so?
- Yeah. What did you think of our Rajanna?

1456
01:16:46,819 --> 01:16:47,622
He is our village headman.

1457
01:16:47,822 --> 01:16:49,902
- Tell me after offering the lift.
- Alright, get on.

(SIGHS)

1459
01:16:52,544 --> 01:16:54,571
- Bro, our Rajanna is like our God.
- Hmm.

1460
01:16:55,065 --> 01:16:56,652
- He will do anything for us.
- Hmm.

1461
01:16:56,762 --> 01:17:00,354
Forget about it.
He abandoned his very own son for us.

1462
01:17:00,519 --> 01:17:01,559
He is such a great person.

1463
01:17:02,563 --> 01:17:03,946
Heard that they are not on talking terms?

1464
01:17:03,970 --> 01:17:05,497
Who told you?
There is nothing as such.

1465
01:17:05,697 --> 01:17:07,815
What happened was, we
have a neighbouring village.

1466
01:17:08,069 --> 01:17:10,059
'Peta Palli Village'

1467
01:17:10,537 --> 01:17:12,520
Why is it having just suffixes?
What about the name of the village?

1468
01:17:12,544 --> 01:17:15,089
That's the case of those villagers.
They named the village on their own.

1469
01:17:15,113 --> 01:17:16,753
Everybody call them as 'umbrella people'.

1470
01:17:17,299 --> 01:17:18,962
They always carry
umbrellas in their hands.

1471
01:17:18,986 --> 01:17:20,306
They always argue for everything.

1472
01:17:20,706 --> 01:17:25,036
One day, the guy from our village
honked at the girl of their village.

1473
01:17:25,136 --> 01:17:26,776
So, those villagers tied him to the tree.

1474
01:17:27,442 --> 01:17:28,706
- Tied him?
- Yes.

1475
01:17:29,142 --> 01:17:31,379
All those umbrella people
behave in the same way. Brainless idiots!

1476
01:17:31,403 --> 01:17:33,324
They believe in everybody's
stories without any introspection.

1477
01:17:33,348 --> 01:17:36,557
Rajanna started very
angrily upon knowing this.

1478
01:17:36,713 --> 01:17:39,372
He asked that girl if the guy of
our village had really teased her.

1479
01:17:39,553 --> 01:17:40,824
And when the girl said no,

1480
01:17:41,016 --> 01:17:43,840
he chopped both the hands of the guy
who tied our village guy to the tree.

1481
01:17:43,850 --> 01:17:44,850
- Huh!
- Yeah.

1482
01:17:45,791 --> 01:17:47,613
Bro, why are you narrating
it in such a simple way?

1483
01:17:47,637 --> 01:17:49,557
That is how our Rajanna
behaves if he gets angry.

you take the law in your hands?"

And his father questions him, "Why should
the justice be delivered just by you?"

1497

In this way, the argument grew big
and it ended up as a very big fight.

Rajanna's son got very angry due
to this fight and left the home.

why did they build a temple for the bike?

Hmph! If not a temple, would they
build a cement furnace for God(BIKE)?

Will the bike become

What a blind love!

1685
01:31:30,652 --> 01:31:32,077
Baby are you hurt?

1686
01:31:32,429 --> 01:31:33,217
Why do you ask like that?

1687
01:31:33,417 --> 01:31:35,258
Strangely I feel a pain in my chest.

1688
01:31:35,439 --> 01:31:36,439
Oh! Come on!

1689
01:31:36,469 --> 01:31:37,861
You and your silly jokes.

1690
01:31:38,036 --> 01:31:40,016
Don't tell me such things. Got it?

1691
01:31:40,254 --> 01:31:42,425
I'm not lying! I like you so much.

1692
01:31:43,999 --> 01:31:44,999
Here...

1693
01:31:45,749 --> 01:31:48,337
Why? You don't eat salted biscuits!

1694
01:31:48,851 --> 01:31:50,371
But the person who gave them is sweet!

1695
01:31:52,662 --> 01:31:55,988
Damn! Hey! You'd get to the streets.

1696
01:31:56,638 --> 01:31:57,771
Damn!

1697
01:32:03,764 --> 01:32:05,842
- Why do you block my way?
- As you are beautiful.

1698
01:32:06,655 --> 01:32:08,091
Huh! God!

1699
01:32:10,358 --> 01:32:12,638
Hey! What's the girl asking
you and what did you answer?

1700
01:32:13,179 --> 01:32:14,828
Do you have any sense at all?

1701
01:32:14,979 --> 01:32:17,084
Sanjay is better than you people. Damn!

1702
01:32:18,857 --> 01:32:20,609
Hey! Eat this. Not him!

1703
01:32:21,964 --> 01:32:23,564
It's better to be with him than be here.

1704
01:32:23,862 --> 01:32:28,238
(OLD TOLLYWOOD SONG PLAYING)

1705
01:32:28,438 --> 01:32:30,740
(PHONE RINGS) Hey!

1706
01:32:31,726 --> 01:32:32,272
Yo!

1707
01:32:32,429 --> 01:32:34,669
You said you'd be back in two days.
Where did you vanish?

1708
01:32:34,794 --> 01:32:37,156
I'm right here. You know Madhapur...

1709
01:32:37,749 --> 01:32:41,117
I'm in a small village
500 kilometres from there.

1710
01:32:41,409 --> 01:32:42,409
What are you doing there?

1711
01:32:42,508 --> 01:32:45,299
You know, the office work is too hectic.

1712
01:32:45,565 --> 01:32:47,226
- Oh god!
- Will you tell me or not?

1713
01:32:47,422 --> 01:32:49,841
Hey, that's what is the truth!

1714
01:32:50,240 --> 01:32:51,240
Swear on me?

1715
01:32:52,179 --> 01:32:53,502
I'm here for the Rajdoot.

1716
01:32:53,675 --> 01:32:54,675
What?

1717
01:32:56,472 --> 01:32:58,553
Your grandpa needs a Rajdoot right?

1718
01:32:59,237 --> 01:33:02,808
I've been searching all over
for it and reached Kadapa.

1719
01:33:03,163 --> 01:33:08,156
There is someone called Rajanna here.

1720
01:33:08,286 --> 01:33:11,060
Anyway, you don't worry.
I'll get the bike.

1721
01:33:15,440 --> 01:33:16,555
Dad...

1722
01:33:17,340 --> 01:33:18,799
What did you send him for?

1723
01:33:19,157 --> 01:33:20,157
He says some Rajdoot.

1724
01:33:20,309 --> 01:33:22,000
He is roaming around crazily for that.

1725
01:33:22,925 --> 01:33:24,572
He is taking a risk of his life.

1726
01:33:27,014 --> 01:33:28,030
He says my grandpa!

1727
01:33:28,386 --> 01:33:29,626
But I don't have a grandpa now!

1728
01:33:31,712 --> 01:33:33,752
He isn't your grandpa dear. It's his.

1729
01:33:35,690 --> 01:33:39,240
Whom your dad liked a lot
before he went into a coma.

1730
01:33:39,892 --> 01:33:40,972
If you can get them to him,

1731
01:33:41,510 --> 01:33:43,678
there is a chance for mild recovrry.

1732
01:33:46,746 --> 01:33:48,022
What do you plan to do now?

1733
01:33:49,898 --> 01:33:52,098
I think it's better to
get the bike your father likes.

1734
01:34:02,802 --> 01:34:06,307
(SIGHS) He doesn't even know
what his brother is studying.

1735
01:34:06,729 --> 01:34:09,081
Why would he go for the
grandpa he has never seen?

1736
01:34:09,393 --> 01:34:11,503
I know how to make Sanjay get it.

1737
01:34:12,275 --> 01:34:13,680
He will bring it for sure.

1738
01:34:14,211 --> 01:34:17,543
Leave it to me. I'll take care of it.
Stop Stressing.

1739
01:34:21,286 --> 01:34:23,018
Whatever I said was about his Grandfather.

1740
01:34:23,528 --> 01:34:24,591
Sorry dad.

1741
01:34:24,791 --> 01:34:26,527
Even I want to give you the best

1742
01:34:28,112 --> 01:34:29,845
Sanjay is the best one for you.

1743
01:34:33,988 --> 01:34:36,961
Tomorrow I've got to
convince Rajanna somehow.

1744
01:35:03,669 --> 01:35:04,453
- Hey!
- Sir...

1745
01:35:04,475 --> 01:35:05,475
Give me a soft drink.

1746
01:35:13,063 --> 01:35:14,108
Damn!

1747
01:35:43,629 --> 01:35:45,749
It'll not come to you how
much ever you roam around me

1748
01:35:45,836 --> 01:35:47,290
I don't have any other option sir

1749
01:35:47,546 --> 01:35:48,998
I've got to go back only with it.

1750
01:35:50,819 --> 01:35:52,779
Pray to god that you should
return back home alive

1751
01:35:53,021 --> 01:35:55,421
I have to get it back even at
the cost of losing my life sir.

1752
01:35:56,044 --> 01:35:59,056
You can't take it till I'm alive.

1753
01:36:00,693 --> 01:36:02,840
I can't oppose you anyway

1754
01:36:03,218 --> 01:36:05,258
I have a small hope that
I could at least change you

1755
01:36:05,484 --> 01:36:06,977
I won't change for anyone.

1756
01:36:07,613 --> 01:36:08,613
Yes...

1757
01:36:08,773 --> 01:36:11,973
Only because you won't change, you're
seeing your son in this bike so many years.

1758
01:36:34,420 --> 01:36:35,856
I won't change for anyone.

1759
01:36:36,349 --> 01:36:37,349
Yes...

1760
01:36:37,693 --> 01:36:40,853
Only because you won't change, you're
seeing your son in this bike so many years

1761
01:36:45,223 --> 01:36:47,358
(PHONE RINGS)

1762
01:36:50,156 --> 01:36:50,763
Tell me.

1763
01:36:50,963 --> 01:36:52,413
What happened to the bike?

1764
01:36:52,688 --> 01:36:54,950
I've just found it yesterday.
I've asked them immediately.

1765
01:36:54,974 --> 01:36:57,039
They've waited for
nothing and bashed me up.

1766
01:36:57,148 --> 01:37:01,227
When I've tried to be at their back
and convince them, it didn't work out.

1767
01:37:01,354 --> 01:37:03,542
Now I'm left out with one option...
theft.

1768
01:37:04,347 --> 01:37:06,273
How? What do you mean how?

1769
01:37:06,679 --> 01:37:08,561
Are you a bloody question book?

1770
01:37:09,082 --> 01:37:10,682
Do I need to explain the plot in detail?

1771
01:37:10,744 --> 01:37:13,095
Listen...
Rajanna would go to the temple from home

1772
01:37:13,239 --> 01:37:14,399
and to the mill from there...

1773
01:37:14,535 --> 01:37:17,579
The dumbo doesn't even check if he
removed the key from the bike there.

1774
01:37:17,856 --> 01:37:19,709
Isn't the time enough for me
to slip the bike from there?

1775
01:37:19,733 --> 01:37:21,373
Now you stop eating my brain and hang up.

1776
01:37:34,665 --> 01:37:35,665
Shucks!

1777
01:37:36,120 --> 01:37:37,120
(SNORES)

1778
01:37:42,710 --> 01:37:43,710
Bloody...

1779
01:37:45,220 --> 01:37:46,374
- Hey! Crap!
- Yuck!

1780
01:37:46,506 --> 01:37:49,806
- Didn't know you weren't straight!
- I'll molest you if you fall on me again!

1781
01:37:54,947 --> 01:37:55,988
Hey you kiddos!

1782
01:37:56,548 --> 01:37:59,188
We can't do anything about the bike
when it's in Rajanna's village.

1783
01:37:59,375 --> 01:38:01,762
Get it here.
We'll decide what to do with it.

1784
01:38:02,294 --> 01:38:04,122
What? Yeah.

1785
01:38:04,991 --> 01:38:06,791
I've got to steal the
bike today by all means.

1786
01:38:34,431 --> 01:38:35,431
Hey...

1787
01:38:36,375 --> 01:38:38,010
Hey! Hey man!

1788
01:38:41,312 --> 01:38:42,525
Oh damn!

1789
01:38:44,611 --> 01:38:47,502
You stole it as I didn't
give it to you when you asked?

1790
01:38:47,940 --> 01:38:49,223
- I'm innocent bro!
- Rajanna!

1791
01:38:49,592 --> 01:38:51,502
Rajanna... he's the one who stole Rajdoot.

1792
01:38:51,592 --> 01:38:54,079
Hey! What are you talking?

1793
01:38:54,424 --> 01:38:56,198
He was plotting the robbery
yesterday right before me.

1794
01:38:56,222 --> 01:38:57,252
Now he is bluffing.

1795
01:38:57,394 --> 01:38:58,536
It's him who did it bro!

1796
01:38:59,044 --> 01:39:00,044
Where is the bike?

1797
01:39:00,365 --> 01:39:01,451
Hey! What are you saying?

1798
01:39:01,651 --> 01:39:04,118
Bro... if I stole it,
I would have excaped with them!

1799
01:39:04,448 --> 01:39:05,448
Think once bro...

1800
01:39:05,532 --> 01:39:08,052
Anyway, who will go against you
to help me in this villiage bro?

1801
01:39:11,089 --> 01:39:12,271
How do they look?

1802
01:39:12,688 --> 01:39:14,928
There were two of them.
They had umbrellas in their hands

1803
01:39:20,113 --> 01:39:25,126
(BAND BEING PLAYED)

1804
01:39:37,184 --> 01:39:38,184
Put it!

1805
01:39:39,150 --> 01:39:40,150
You put one too!

1806
01:39:40,465 --> 01:39:41,703
Like that!

1807
01:39:48,121 --> 01:39:49,153
Pout the fuel.

1808
01:39:49,674 --> 01:39:50,737
Just pour it.

1809
01:39:51,454 --> 01:39:53,666
Pour it kid! Pour all of it!

1810
01:39:54,568 --> 01:39:57,400
This should burn Rajanna's heart.

1811
01:39:58,092 --> 01:39:59,478
Pour it! Pour it all!

1812
01:40:08,787 --> 01:40:10,306
Hey! Hand me the torch!

01:40:12,591 --> 01:40:13,591

Hey!

1819
01:40:31,726 --> 01:40:32,726
Hey!

1820
01:41:07,494 --> 01:41:08,494
(SCREAMS)

1821
01:41:58,329 --> 01:41:59,705
What a bashing!

1822
01:42:00,594 --> 01:42:02,657
He just came in, bashed our guys and left!

1823
01:42:07,030 --> 01:42:09,667
We got the bike with a lot
of risk and you saved it!

1824
01:42:09,863 --> 01:42:11,102
Now who is going to save you?

1825
01:42:11,604 --> 01:42:14,051
Kiddo! You stopped our vengeance?

1826
01:42:14,423 --> 01:42:16,023
It's a vengeance of long time!

1827
01:42:16,485 --> 01:42:19,860
Yeah! Rajanna was here till now.

1828
01:42:20,060 --> 01:42:22,166
We were hesitant. Now who would save you?

1829
01:42:24,032 --> 01:42:25,850
Damn him! He's here?

1830
01:42:26,695 --> 01:42:27,695
Hey Sanjay!

1831
01:42:28,495 --> 01:42:30,723
- Who's he?
- Where do I search for you?

1832
01:42:32,108 --> 01:42:34,478
Where's the head? Oh! It's a bit above!

1833
01:42:34,775 --> 01:42:35,775
Why is it so big?

1834
01:42:35,961 --> 01:42:37,001
Whatever, not my business!

1835
01:42:37,090 --> 01:42:39,222
Hey! You made me board a
truck on the highway and left!

1836
01:42:39,246 --> 01:42:42,429
He looks like a rag picker.
He's gonna save you now?

1837
01:42:43,051 --> 01:42:44,779
He isn't here to save me!

1838
01:42:46,186 --> 01:42:47,370
Then whom does he save?

1839
01:42:47,954 --> 01:42:48,954
Whom are you here for?

1840
01:42:49,093 --> 01:42:50,624
Looks like they'd crush my
bones if I say it's for him.

1841
01:42:50,648 --> 01:42:51,734
It's for you!

1842
01:42:52,310 --> 01:42:53,533
- For me?
- Yeah!

1843
01:42:53,787 --> 01:42:54,787
Did he fall for it?

1844
01:42:54,890 --> 01:42:57,029
Look... he is here for you.

1845
01:42:58,844 --> 01:43:02,265
Well... do you remember your
dad used to visit the city daily?

1846
01:43:03,115 --> 01:43:08,803
Yes kiddo! His father asked me not
to when I said I'd accompany him once!

1847
01:43:09,538 --> 01:43:11,671
So my father...

1848
01:43:12,010 --> 01:43:12,689
But then...

1849
01:43:12,889 --> 01:43:15,013
Hey! How can you remember it?
You weren't born then!

1850
01:43:15,414 --> 01:43:16,814
This guy's spreading his net again.

1851
01:43:17,126 --> 01:43:18,206
Why do you stare like that?

1852
01:43:18,235 --> 01:43:19,997
You still didn't get who he is?

1853
01:43:23,641 --> 01:43:24,790
- Brother!
- Brother?

1854
01:43:24,926 --> 01:43:25,930
- Brother?
- Brother?

1855
01:43:28,074 --> 01:43:31,454
Does Nagarjuna Sagar have
anything to do with Penna river?

Where have you been all these days?

1857
01:43:33,021 --> 01:43:35,893
Hey! My bones are about to break!
Leave me! Let go!

1858
01:43:37,631 --> 01:43:38,647

1859
01:43:38,847 --> 01:43:39,325
Huh?

1860
01:43:39,525 --> 01:43:41,654
Yesterday night,
your dad appeared in my dream and told me.

1861
01:43:41,678 --> 01:43:42,678
What did he say?

1862
01:43:44,325 --> 01:43:45,325
Thank god!

1863
01:43:46,164 --> 01:43:48,864
Atleast now you understand
why the statue broke?

1864
01:43:48,964 --> 01:43:50,298
As Rajanna hit it!

1865
01:43:50,955 --> 01:43:52,063

Don't you still get it?

1867
01:43:55,495 --> 01:43:58,918
His heart broke seeing that
you ignored his second son.

1868
01:44:00,003 --> 01:44:02,490
But it's the statue that broke!
Why does he say it's his heart?

1869
01:44:02,726 --> 01:44:06,984
Well... I'm just comparing the broken
statue to his heart symolically.

1870
01:44:07,941 --> 01:44:08,682
Oh!

1871
01:44:08,965 --> 01:44:12,182
Anyway, the statue lies in his heart.

1872
01:44:12,594 --> 01:44:14,421
- Is it?
- If you take good care of this guy...

1873
01:44:14,445 --> 01:44:15,647
- Yeah.
- It's like taking care of him.

1874
01:44:15,671 --> 01:44:16,096
Yeah...

1875
01:44:16,389 --> 01:44:17,730
This is your plate of biryani.

1876
01:44:17,989 --> 01:44:20,492
Hey! Why are you leaving
reciting some cooked up story?

1877
01:44:20,592 --> 01:44:21,712
- Brother!
- Hey wait for me!

1878
01:44:22,299 --> 01:44:24,289
Is everybody in the
village so dumb headed?

1879
01:44:24,786 --> 01:44:25,800
What are you staring at?

1880
01:44:26,907 --> 01:44:30,051
Well... the bike was with me.

1881
01:44:30,795 --> 01:44:32,987
Rajanna was fighting on the other side.

1882
01:44:33,546 --> 01:44:37,821
Why did I handover the bike to Rajanna
instead of slipping away with the bike?

1883
01:44:40,287 --> 01:44:41,508
Huh! Well...

1884

chicken while eating it and not the hen!

1888
01:44:50,457 --> 01:44:54,100
Some people worship a bike like god,
and some people sacrifice a bike to god.

You are great!

1891
01:45:00,600 --> 01:45:02,080
- Why did you leave me to them?
- Hey!

1893
01:45:03,884 --> 01:45:06,321
No one used me like you did
on the face of this earth!

1894
01:45:06,405 --> 01:45:09,682
Mani, do you think your
mom gave you birth for you?

1895
01:45:09,882 --> 01:45:11,536
- Eh?
- She gave you birth for me dude!

1896
01:45:12,563 --> 01:45:14,053
Please don't praise me anymore!

1897
01:45:15,331 --> 01:45:17,182
I don't have anything other than my life.

1898
01:45:17,793 --> 01:45:20,563
That's okay, but how did you come there?

1899

Dude,
all the villagers are talking about it.

1900
01:45:22,792 --> 01:45:25,375
Rajanna caught a fair looking guy by
the collar, dragged him onto the road.

1901
01:45:25,399 --> 01:45:26,674
Hey!

1902

Always saying my uncle hit me,
Rajanna caught me by the collar.

Cut the crap! Come to the point.

1905
01:45:35,058 --> 01:45:36,239

Is this true?

1910
01:45:44,669 --> 01:45:46,909
Hey! Who told you I'm your brother?

1911
01:45:47,126 --> 01:45:49,006
- He says my father told him in his dream!
- Ah!

1912
01:45:49,335 --> 01:45:51,543
Man! He should've either
appeared in your dream or mine.

1913
01:45:51,822 --> 01:45:53,542
Why would he appear in
someone else's dream?

mole on his right thigh.

and escaped from there.

- Ah!
- Anyway...

how did you cook such a
nasty story on the spot?

1925

hear since childhood?

01:54:14,207 --> 01:54:16,613
but today, I come for someone's life.

2028
01:54:17,866 --> 01:54:18,935
Is brother in any danger?

2029
01:54:21,346 --> 01:54:23,003
Is father in any danger?

2030
01:54:30,237 --> 01:54:33,763
Usually when people lose faith on people,
they develop love on objects.

2031
01:54:36,461 --> 01:54:38,584
But if we could give their
faith back to them...

2032
01:54:39,810 --> 01:54:43,094
Thety'd be very happy sir... very happy.

2033
01:54:45,119 --> 01:54:46,479
Today, rather than seeing the bike

2034
01:54:46,569 --> 01:54:49,770
I feel that he'd be happy to see
the separated brothers together.

2035
01:54:51,558 --> 01:54:53,118
Please come down at least for his sake.

2036
01:54:53,858 --> 01:54:56,857
Earlier when you came here,
I expected you to speak like this.

2037
01:54:57,805 --> 01:55:00,599
Whom do I have for myself... except you?

2038
01:55:01,128 --> 01:55:03,167
Let's go son. Come!

2039
01:55:08,749 --> 01:55:10,117
I'm going to my dad.

2040
01:55:15,520 --> 01:55:20,510
"Love of life on a side and
a strange bond on another."

2041
01:55:20,904 --> 01:55:24,543
"On which side does the shore exist?"

2042
01:55:26,280 --> 01:55:31,366
"Can the pupil rest if the
dreams turn into thorns?"

2043
01:55:41,520 --> 01:55:47,037
(AMBULANCE SIREN)

2044
01:55:56,983 --> 01:55:58,550
Dude... why's the bike here?

2045
01:56:00,657 --> 01:56:01,685
Why's the bike here?

2046
01:56:11,999 --> 01:56:13,440
Sir... what brings you here?

2047
01:56:22,526 --> 01:56:25,728
'We can go till any lengths
for something we love'

2048
01:56:26,692 --> 01:56:28,408
'but I didn't know it
would come till this'

2049
01:56:29,631 --> 01:56:31,706
'There are two lives
linked to this bike now'

2050
01:56:32,608 --> 01:56:35,213
'One is yours,
and another belongs to an elderly man'

2051
01:56:36,233 --> 01:56:38,502
'Yet, I remembered you still because'

2052
01:56:38,697 --> 01:56:41,317
'I saw the love you have
for this bike practically'

2053
01:56:41,560 --> 01:56:46,497
'I don't know the elderly man's fate if he
doesn't see Rajdoot once he's out of coma'

2054
01:56:47,409 --> 01:56:51,530
'But the moment you knew Rajdoot was
missing, you ended up with a heart attack'

2055
01:56:53,510 --> 01:56:55,390
'That's why I thought
this should stay with you'

2056
01:56:56,550 --> 01:56:58,139
'The way you are saving it...'

2057
01:56:59,269 --> 01:57:02,184
'this should stay right here saving you'

2058
01:57:02,675 --> 01:57:07,711
The moment he saved the bike from fire,
I understood how badly he needed it.

2059
01:57:09,055 --> 01:57:11,220
I was just planning to give
it to him by the morning.

2060
01:57:11,852 --> 01:57:13,173
But meanwhile this happened.

2061
01:57:14,973 --> 01:57:18,727
Anyway, I had the heart attack
not because he took the bike.

2062
01:57:20,204 --> 01:57:22,622
But because my daughter left
the house without telling me

2063
01:57:23,225 --> 01:57:24,680
(SOBS)

2064
01:57:26,995 --> 01:57:29,857
But do you know why I
liked that bike so much?

2065
01:57:30,386 --> 01:57:32,427
I see you in that always.

2066
01:57:34,012 --> 01:57:36,651
The day you stopped talking to me...

2067
01:57:37,348 --> 01:57:39,294
I started talking to that bike

2068
01:57:39,499 --> 01:57:40,614
I'm sorry dad.

2069
01:57:41,139 --> 01:57:44,685
Now that you came back to me,
why do I need that bike son?

2070
01:57:46,657 --> 01:57:48,592
He made you come back to me.

2071
01:57:49,627 --> 01:57:50,763
He saved my daughter too.

2072
01:57:51,875 --> 01:57:53,144
What else do I need son?

2073
01:57:54,297 --> 01:57:55,583
Give him his bike back!

2074
01:58:00,629 --> 01:58:01,898
And this...

2075
01:58:03,102 --> 01:58:04,102
is yours.

2076
01:58:07,522 --> 01:58:08,522
Hmm...

2077
01:58:09,297 --> 01:58:10,297
Good luck!

2078
01:58:12,915 --> 01:58:14,000
Careful father.

2079
01:58:19,929 --> 01:58:21,031
- Dude...
- Yeah.

2080
01:58:21,804 --> 01:58:22,972
What is my father doing here?

2081
01:58:23,082 --> 01:58:24,203
How are you?

2082
01:58:25,134 --> 01:58:26,222
I'm doing good brother.

2083
01:58:26,848 --> 01:58:30,673
Brother?
Why is he calling my dad his bother dude?

2084
01:58:30,923 --> 01:58:34,529
- How are you younger one?
- Father!

2085
01:58:34,892 --> 01:58:36,006
Younger one...

2086
01:58:36,756 --> 01:58:37,929
What's happening here?

2087
01:58:38,289 --> 01:58:40,840
Even the characters in a Korean
film never confused me so much.

2088
01:58:41,093 --> 01:58:43,594
He is the one father...
brother's elder son Sanjay.

2089
01:58:43,868 --> 01:58:44,868
Grandpa?

2090
01:58:45,652 --> 01:58:48,852
He got back our bike we thought we lost
10 years ago with a lot of effort father.

2091
01:58:49,289 --> 01:58:50,432
Oh god!

2092
01:58:51,155 --> 01:58:52,448
You've been made a jackass!

2093
01:58:52,651 --> 01:58:53,721
Who's a jackass here?

2094
01:58:54,815 --> 01:58:56,483
Everyone has a clarity there!

2095
01:58:56,699 --> 01:58:58,312
You've made a jackass of me!

2096
01:58:58,547 --> 01:59:02,271
Dude, I'm an outsider. How can I
know who your aunts and uncles are?

2097
01:59:02,960 --> 01:59:05,468
You don't even know
who your relatives are?

2098
01:59:05,711 --> 01:59:08,005
How can you live without
minimum family emotions man?

2099
01:59:08,205 --> 01:59:09,940
What's the worth of your life?

2100
01:59:10,528 --> 01:59:11,528
Oh damn!

2101
01:59:11,888 --> 01:59:12,979
Lakshmi!

2102
01:59:13,238 --> 01:59:16,041
(GROANS) Lakshmi!

2103
01:59:19,633 --> 01:59:23,754
Hey... come here lad!

2104
01:59:24,410 --> 01:59:27,148
- Have you got it back for me?
- Yes grandpa.

2105
01:59:27,394 --> 01:59:29,282
It's like your grandmother!

2106
01:59:30,440 --> 01:59:34,008
Lakshmi! Oh Lakshmi!

2107
01:59:37,803 --> 01:59:39,283
- Your father-in-law is here.
- Is he?

2108
01:59:39,753 --> 01:59:41,073
- Where is he?
- Right behind you.

2109
01:59:41,325 --> 01:59:42,325
What's he up to?

2110
01:59:42,491 --> 01:59:43,598
- Hey!
- Yeah.

2111
01:59:43,706 --> 01:59:44,770
You've made me a jackass!

2112
01:59:45,058 --> 01:59:46,422
- You are one!
- Ah!

2113
01:59:46,779 --> 01:59:49,299
Else you should've got it when you
started to the village first.

2114
01:59:49,541 --> 01:59:50,689
- Ain't it?
- Of course!

2115
01:59:51,037 --> 01:59:53,256
- It's this guy actually...
- Nice meeting you.

2116
01:59:54,441 --> 01:59:56,323
Anyway,
I got the bike back as you asked uncle!

2117
01:59:56,473 --> 01:59:58,364
- Yeah...
- So shall we fix the wedding?

2118
01:59:59,540 --> 02:00:01,364
- I asked the bike for my father.
- Eh?

2119
02:00:01,653 --> 02:00:05,305
You brought the bike for your grandpa,
united your family.

2120
02:00:07,461 --> 02:00:09,127
- (CHUCKLES)
- Huh?

2121
02:00:09,691 --> 02:00:12,263
- I got the bike as you asked!
- Yeah...

2122
02:00:12,454 --> 02:00:13,804
- And now you talk like this?
- Ah!

2123
02:00:13,828 --> 02:00:14,915
This is injustice uncle!

2124
02:00:15,115 --> 02:00:16,288
You feel it's an injustice?

2125
02:00:16,488 --> 02:00:17,183
Isn't it then?

2126
02:00:17,431 --> 02:00:18,910
I'll give you another chance then.

2127
02:00:19,224 --> 02:00:19,751
Ah!

2128
02:00:19,885 --> 02:00:22,945
Long ago, my father had a Premier
Padmini car in the village.

2129
02:00:23,066 --> 02:00:26,056
- Ah!
- He sold it when he was in need of money.

2130
02:00:26,307 --> 02:00:26,827
Oh!

2131
02:00:27,027 --> 02:00:29,238
Get it back and I'll
marry my daughter to you.

2132
02:00:31,799 --> 02:00:34,804
- You'd become a used item dealer this way.
- That's what dude!

2133
02:00:34,978 --> 02:00:35,978
What?

2134
02:00:36,111 --> 02:00:37,655
Good concept uncle! Very good concept.

2135
02:00:38,760 --> 02:00:40,456
- Do you what they call this?
- Eh?

2136
02:00:40,554 --> 02:00:41,322
Craziness.

2137
02:00:41,522 --> 02:00:43,273
Crazy father-in-laws like you...

2138
02:00:44,399 --> 02:00:45,435
- No.
- Okay, come.

2139
02:00:46,141 --> 02:00:48,147
Hey! What's this?

2140
02:00:48,852 --> 02:00:49,852
Hello!

2141
02:00:50,265 --> 02:00:53,336
Uncle! You don't get to him.
He'll get to me then.

2142
02:00:53,698 --> 02:00:55,289
Then we both will have to get to the road!

2143
02:00:55,313 --> 02:00:57,845
Already my life's become a super big mess.

2144
02:00:58,065 --> 02:00:59,065
What's with you huh?

2145
02:00:59,455 --> 02:01:02,885
Anyway, that guy mistakes a
chickoo for a boiled potato.

2146
02:01:03,111 --> 02:01:05,212
And you're the kind who'd show a
chickoo and make one eat a potato

2147
02:01:05,236 --> 02:01:07,080
I can't deal with you both. Leave me!

2148
02:01:07,644 --> 02:01:09,541
Do you have a girl friend too?

2149
02:01:09,741 --> 02:01:11,977
Why? Planning to assign me some
work and send me to Pakistan?

2150
02:01:12,001 --> 02:01:14,355
Something good I haven't
done in life is... love.

2151
02:01:14,555 --> 02:01:15,555
Oh! Is it?

2152
02:01:15,590 --> 02:01:17,068
- There are two reasons why.
- Tell me.

2153
02:01:17,092 --> 02:01:18,892
- One is...
- Hello, Sujana. Did you eat food?

2154
02:01:19,321 --> 02:01:22,192
- Are you leaving me?
- It's because of such people.

2155
02:01:22,585 --> 02:01:24,873
- Second reason is father-in-laws like you.
- Oh!

2156
02:01:24,973 --> 02:01:27,636
If we get into a love marriage,
son-in-law should respect father-in-law.

2157
02:01:27,660 --> 02:01:29,275
- Oh...
- But in case of arranged marriage.

2158
02:01:29,299 --> 02:01:30,557
Father-in-law has to
respect his son-in-law.

2159
02:01:30,581 --> 02:01:31,781
- Is it?
- I want that respect.

2160
02:01:31,949 --> 02:01:32,730
- You want that respect?
- Yeah.

2161
02:01:32,930 --> 02:01:34,528
Come, I'll show you that respect

2162
02:01:34,624 --> 02:01:35,624
(GROANS)

2163
02:02:41,783 --> 02:02:46,202
Do you want to marry your daughter to him
after knowing everything about my son?

2164
02:02:46,402 --> 02:02:50,112
It's because I know everything about him,
Im so happy to marry my daughter to him.

2165
02:02:50,211 --> 02:02:51,577
- Is it true?
- Yeah.

2166
02:02:51,908 --> 02:02:54,945
You should've understood when
I put such a big job on him.

2167
02:02:55,301 --> 02:02:56,958
How much I trust him.

2168
02:02:58,036 --> 02:03:01,938
Anyway, wedding doesn't require a
qualification, but responsibility.

2169
02:03:02,305 --> 02:03:03,453
He has it now.

2170
02:03:04,203 --> 02:03:07,910
I can't search for a more good
and perfect fellow than him.

2171
02:03:08,454 --> 02:03:09,755
Let that happen then.

2172
02:03:10,697 --> 02:03:11,697
All the best!

2173
02:03:11,873 --> 02:03:12,873
To you too!
