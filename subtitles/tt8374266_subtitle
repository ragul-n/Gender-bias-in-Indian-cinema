1
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:26,208
India under the Mughal rule.

2
00:01:26,208 --> 00:01:29,416
Emperor Shah Jahan on the throne.

3
00:01:29,416 --> 00:01:33,666
Dara Sukoh, the emperor's oldest son,
stayed by his side.

4
00:01:33,666 --> 00:01:37,333
Among the other princes,
Murad was in Gujarat.

5
00:01:37,333 --> 00:01:39,500
Auragazeb was in the Deccan.

6
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:43,083
And Prince Shuja was in Bengal.

7
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,083
Bengal became very rich under Shuja.

8
00:01:50,083 --> 00:01:55,125
Shuja too became wealthy.

9
00:01:55,625 --> 00:01:59,250
6th September, 1657.

10
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:04,333
It was rumoured
that Emperor Shah Jahan is dead.

11
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:11,958
The princes descended on Delhi
to claim their right to the throne.

12
00:02:11,958 --> 00:02:15,416
Murad and Aurangazeb
marched from the West.

13
00:02:15,416 --> 00:02:16,958
Shuja marched from the East.

14
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,458
Dara also prepared himself
to confront his brothers.

15
00:02:21,583 --> 00:02:26,875
Dara's brave son Suleiman
encountered Shuja in a bloody battle.

16
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:34,875
Shuja lost and returned to Bengal.

17
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:37,583
Aurangazeb put Shah Jahan
under house arrest.

18
00:02:37,583 --> 00:02:40,375
Murdered his brother Dara.

19
00:02:40,375 --> 00:02:45,000
Murad was killed in prison
by assassins.

20
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:50,916
Aurangazeb ascended the throne of Delhi.

21
00:02:50,958 --> 00:02:55,458
Shuja mustered another army
and marched towards Delhi again.

22
00:02:55,916 --> 00:03:01,208
At Khajwa, a decisive battle followed.

23
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:05,541
Shuja was defeated again.

24
00:03:05,541 --> 00:03:09,458
He was chased by
Aurangazeb's commander Mir Jumla.

25
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:14,583
Bengal wasn't safe
for Shuja anymore.

26
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:20,333
He decided to take refuge in Arakan,
the present day Myanmar.

27
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:24,250
He wished to gain strength
and return.

28
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:26,625
Before leaving for Arakan...

29
00:03:26,625 --> 00:03:29,958
He entrusted his enormous wealth...

30
00:03:29,958 --> 00:03:34,708
...among his zamindars and stately princes
to be hidden safely.

31
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:39,208
But Shuja's dreams
didn't come true.

32
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:44,000
Aurangazeb conspired with the Arakan king.

33
00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:57,375
With his death, his hidden treasures
were lost forever.

34
00:03:57,375 --> 00:04:06,333
With time history forgot
Shuja's riches hidden in Bengal.

35
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:13,583
QUEST FOR THE HIDDEN TREASURE

36
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:30,458
BABU NRISHINGHONARAYAN SINGHO RAY
MANIKANTAPUR 1659

37
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:47,291
Sir is in the study.

38
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:18,916
- Mr. Singhi?
- Come in, Ramkrishna.

39
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:23,500
I thought you always mind
your own business.

40
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,083
And now you've got caught up
in the six-nine case.

41
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:29,041
- Pardon, sir?
- Pardon?

42
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:32,833
Hope you remember
the 10 reincarnations of Lord Vishnu?

43
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:37,500
First is Matsya, the fish.
Second is Kurma, the tortoise.

44
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:43,166
Third is Varaha, the boar.
Fourth is Nrisingho, the half-man and half-lion.

45
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:44,875
Fifth is Vamana, the dwarf.

46
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:50,958
Sixth, seventh and eighth are Parashurama,
Rama and Balarama respectively.

47
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:55,208
Ninth is Krishna and tenth is Kalki.

48
00:05:55,333 --> 00:06:00,750
Ramkrishna, your name
has both Ram and Krishna.

49
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:05,250
Ram meaning Parashurama,
the "sixth" reincarnation of Lord Vishnu.

50
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:09,041
And Krishna is his "ninth" reincarnation.

51
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:13,875
Vishnu's six and nine
makes your name Ramkrishna.

52
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:19,375
With the setting sun
Six and nine join hands

53
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:29,125
Sir, you're all about riddles and rhymes.

54
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:36,166
The temple needs some repairs.

55
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:40,083
Do these new masons know
how to do terracotta work?

56
00:06:40,291 --> 00:06:45,291
Rai, my sister, is in Kolkata.
Her husband Subir is busy.

57
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:48,541
My nephew is not interested
in this ancient house.

58
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:54,208
Sir, this your house.
You are the owner.

59
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:59,500
I'm being harassed regarding it's sale.

60
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:02,750
So, they've approached you, too?

61
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:05,333
I have no interest
in the 2% of the brokerage...

62
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:12,666
If they approach again, I'll tell them...

63
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:17,625
"Mr. Singhi will not sell the house.
Never."

64
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:19,583
Got it?

65
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:54,916
- Sir?
- Mahadeb.

66
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:57,625
Tell Jyotsna to serve dinner.

67
00:07:57,625 --> 00:08:01,291
- I'm not feeling well. One more thing...
- Okay... Yes...

68
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:04,250
Drop this letter off at the post office.
Don't forget.

69
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,791
Okay.

70
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:14,333
- Jyotsna, serve dinner for sir.
- Okay.

71
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,333
Who's there?

72
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:24,416
Who is there?

73
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:27,458
Who is it?!

74
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:28,916
Who...

75
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,833
FOUR MONTHS LATER...

76
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:51,291
Hi!

77
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:55,750
- Hi, Abir... All good?
- All good... I'll take it.

78
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,250
Thanks.

79
00:08:57,333 --> 00:09:00,333
No need for all this.
Give me a hug.

80
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:02,541
Happy homecoming!

81
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:05,166
- The seven year itch!
- An itch it is.

82
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:08,791
Will you like it here
after so many years in Oxford?

83
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:14,916
My motherland is the queen
among all the countries...

84
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:16,708
Get in... Let's go...

85
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:24,208
That's my beloved Motherland...

86
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:28,000
Sona just returned to India.

87
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,708
After being abroad for so long...
Would he like it here?

88
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:34,666
He can always go back
if he doesn't like it here.

89
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:38,708
With such a brilliant career...

90
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:41,750
But it's good for the country
if guys like him return.

91
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,750
It's surely good
for the country...

92
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,458
But the ones coming back
should also be benefitted.

93
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:47,625
Mom!

94
00:09:47,916 --> 00:09:51,083
- They are here...
- Let's go...

95
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:52,708
Come...

96
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:56,375
Thanks for the gift.

97
00:09:57,333 --> 00:09:58,833
Where are they?

98
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:04,958
- There he is...
- You've lost so much weight, Sona.

99
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:08,041
"You should take better care..."

100
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:08,958
Want a beating?

101
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:12,625
- Thank you...
- Did I not tell you, Sona'da?

102
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:16,083
How many times have I told you,
he's your father's brother?

103
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:19,208
Very simple... first cousin
of first cousin...

104
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:20,625
- Come, sit...
- Sit...

105
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:22,833
Uncle or brother,
big deal...

106
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:26,583
It's old-fashioned.
We prefer calling everyone brother, "dada".

107
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:27,791
Correct.

108
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:30,041
Actually, I like "dada" over uncle.

109
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:32,416
It makes me feel younger...

110
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:37,333
Mom, what's for starters?
Fish roe fritters...

111
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:41,458
This boy lives for food.
Just like his maternal uncle.

112
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:44,500
Well, Sona ...

113
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:49,833
Abir has always been fond of you
and his maternal uncle.

114
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:51,625
Got the sad news
from my mom.

115
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:52,875
Heard your brother passed away suddenly...

116
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:54,541
Yes, very sad.

117
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:56,500
He was a perfectly fit guy.

118
00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:00,458
Had a fatal heart attack
right before dinner.

119
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:02,541
What's the name
of your maternal uncle's place?

120
00:11:02,541 --> 00:11:03,791
Manikantapur.

121
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:05,791
What a romantic name!

122
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:08,250
Your family used to be
zamindars there, right?

123
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:11,291
It used to be spectacular
during it's heyday.

124
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:13,583
Now, only the house remains.

125
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:15,541
Just look at him.

126
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:17,166
- You know, Sona...
- Yeah...

127
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:19,833
This Singho Ray mansion
in Manikantapur...

128
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:22,250
...is about 350 years old.

129
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:23,833
Really? 350 years?

130
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,041
That's from Mughal Emperor
Shah Jahan's era.

131
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:28,208
- Let's make a trip, Sona'da.
- Let's go.

132
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:31,000
Rai, what's up with your son?

133
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:33,458
I'm noticing everything.

134
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:35,041
But you don't like going
to your uncle's place.

135
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:37,500
Credit goes to Professor Subarna Sen.

136
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,708
He upgraded a broken house into
a mansion from Shah Jahan's time...

137
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:43,375
Turned a dilapidated case
into a historical place.

138
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:46,750
Your uncle asked you to visit
so many times.

139
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,750
But you had other priorities.

140
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:51,125
That trekking was more important
for you.

141
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:54,666
Sona, I suggest you two
visit Manikantapur.

142
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:58,833
I hardly get any time off from the court.

143
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:01,875
But we can join you later.

144
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:04,375
I think it's a great idea.

145
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:05,958
I just have to take care
of a few things first.

146
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:08,083
And I'm speaking at two seminars.
One in RBU and the one in JU.

147
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:09,541
Let's go after that.

148
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:13,458
If you leave in the afternoon,
you'll reach by the evening.

149
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:17,166
- Just a matter of three-four hours.
- Done.

150
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:20,708
Great! Let's leave after lunch
and have dessert on the way.

151
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:23,875
Can't you plan anything
other than food?

152
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:27,166
Mom, life is all about food!

153
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:29,666
You haven't changed at all.

154
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:30,208
HISTORICAL SOCIETY OF BENGAL

155
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:33,958
And that's why if we wish
to enjoy history...

156
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:38,250
...we must understand historical connotations
in literature too...

157
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,708
We must always keep in mind...

158
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:45,541
...the novelist, the playwright or the filmmaker
who is working on a historical subject...

159
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:48,541
...is merely inspired.
He's not trying to be a historian.

160
00:12:48,541 --> 00:12:52,750
He's only trying to connect history
with his times through his art.

161
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:56,000
Like Shakespeare's "Macbeth" or "Hamlet".

162
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:58,000
Bankim Chandra Chatterjee's "Raj Singho".

163
00:12:58,375 --> 00:13:00,333
Michael Madhusudan Dutt's "Krishna Kumari".

164
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:05,041
Or Dijendra Lal Roy's "Noor Jahan"
or "Shah Jahan".

165
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:09,541
The key word is inheritance.

166
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:14,791
The way there's inheritance in history,
it's the same with literature and culture.

167
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:18,541
The Bengali culture and literature is so rich...

168
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:21,416
That there's an unmistakeable attachment
to this cultural heritage...

169
00:13:21,416 --> 00:13:26,416
Bengalis as global citizens...

170
00:13:26,416 --> 00:13:34,875
...have a deep rooted pride
for this inheritance.

171
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:37,500
Thank you.

172
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:44,125
You did justice to the buffet.

173
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:48,291
They won't allow us in 6 Ballygunge Place
in the near future.

174
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:51,708
Sona'da, people who cook
only want appreciation.

175
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:55,875
And the proper appreciation of food
is by consuming the food particles.

176
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:58,250
Keep eating the food...

177
00:13:58,375 --> 00:13:59,666
That's true.

178
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:02,333
Only you can come up with such things.

179
00:14:03,291 --> 00:14:07,708
But you can't deny the fact that even in Y2K,
there's nothing like the two "K"s.

180
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:11,750
Y2K is the 21st century
but what does the other two "K"s stand for?

181
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:14,958
KIS and KPJ.

182
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:18,916
KIS is "Kolaghat's Ilish Shorshe",
Kolaghat's mustard fish.

183
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:21,708
And KPJ is "Kochi Pathar Jhol",
mutton curry.

184
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:27,625
When did you last meet your uncle?

185
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:30,750
He'd called right before I left
for the Ladakh trek.

186
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:34,000
He was really insistent about me
visting Manikantapur.

187
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,541
Sad...

188
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,750
He was really witty.

189
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:38,958
He loved to speak
in rhymes and riddles.

190
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:41,708
Really? Tell me how.

191
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:43,250
He would say...

192
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:46,458
"Two sparrows, you and I,
You fly and I fly".

193
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:49,833
You're always flying off the handle
but what about him?

194
00:14:50,041 --> 00:14:52,041
My name is Abir which means colour.
So, I fly.

195
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:54,208
He writes, so he flies through his words.

196
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:57,416
Great sense of humour!

197
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:10,458
Who else lives there?

198
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:13,833
There's Jyotsna, Mahadeb
and their son Nilu.

199
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:17,166
My uncle's childhood friend, Akhilesh
and his daughter, Jhinuk.

200
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:20,666
Jhinuk studies in Kolkata.

201
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:23,250
She is studying Comparative Literature in JU.

202
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:25,750
She just got back recently
on study leave.

203
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:28,125
Missed your seminar.

204
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:32,958
What happened?

205
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:38,375
I just realised how a broken house
suddenly turns into a historical place.

206
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:43,083
Let me take a quick nap.

207
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:17,541
Stop the car.

208
00:16:19,666 --> 00:16:21,958
1659?

209
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:24,375
Almost 350 years old?

210
00:16:25,541 --> 00:16:29,291
- I think they put in the gate later.
- Really?

211
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:32,041
- So, you think the gate is not as old?
- Nope.

212
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:37,375
The date 1659... During that time,
Bengalis used "Sakabda" for calendar.

213
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:41,250
The use of the Gregorian calendar
began after the British came to India.

214
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,250
Great!

215
00:16:53,291 --> 00:16:56,541
Welcome to the palace of the great
Nrishinghonarayan Singho Ray!

216
00:16:56,958 --> 00:17:00,250
The evening prayers are going on
since the time of Nrishinghonarayan.

217
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:02,958
Did your mom's family name you Abir?

218
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,541
Yes, my maternal uncle named me.

219
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:05,625
How did you know?

220
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:07,625
Saka Era or the Gregorian Calendar?

221
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:09,375
Your uncle's name is Harinarayan.

222
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:11,250
His ancestor is Nrishinghonarayan.
Both of which are Lord Vishnu's names.

223
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:12,625
Lord Krishna has been worshipped for ages.

224
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:14,500
Your mom's name is Rai
which is Krishna's beloved Radha's other name.

225
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:18,666
So, you had to be named
after Lord Krishna's favourite colours, Abir.

226
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:22,458
- Great! Let's go...
- Come on...

227
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,083
There you are, Mahadeb.

228
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:26,291
Welcome, sir.

229
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:28,000
How are your parents?

230
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,791
They're well.
What about you?

231
00:17:29,791 --> 00:17:33,791
A lively man like your uncle...
suddenly passed away...

232
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:35,625
This is Sona'da.

233
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:38,666
Please, come in.

234
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:43,041
This way...

235
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:48,500
Mahadeb and his family lives
across the courtyard.

236
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,833
And this is my uncle's home.

237
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:54,708
I've made sleeping arrangements for you
in your uncle's bedroom.

238
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:56,541
It's great that you've come.

239
00:17:56,583 --> 00:17:59,458
The house seems deserted
without him.

240
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:00,916
Please go ahead.

241
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,708
Let's go, Sona'da.

242
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:15,541
Nrishinghonarayan!

243
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:18,208
He looks daunting.

244
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:23,083
He's responsible for the family's prosperity...

245
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:26,958
Come in...

246
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:38,208
I really miss him.

247
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:45,958
This looks like a Lazarus furniture.

248
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,416
Abir.

249
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:50,791
Ramkrishna Uncle,
done with the prayers?

250
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:52,875
Carrying on somehow...

251
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:57,458
Barely managing...

252
00:18:57,458 --> 00:19:03,375
I got some gopalbhog sweets
since you're coming.

253
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:05,875
This was my uncle's favourite!

254
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:08,833
- He was unique...
- Thank you.

255
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,791
He would read all day...

256
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:18,125
In this gloomy evening...

257
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:23,208
Although, I'm wearing
the sacred beads...

258
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:24,958
Good bye.

259
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:28,625
The night is getting darker.

260
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:33,458
What's the matter with him?

261
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:37,958
"Gloomy evening"... "Sacred beads"...
But why so scared?

262
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:41,500
Fear follows the one who is afraid.

263
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:44,625
Please, let me eat in peace.

264
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:47,083
- What did I do?
- Damn it!

265
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:59,208
Dear God, please protect me.

266
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:03,916
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do

267
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:08,291
This extravagant arrangement...

268
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:13,750
No wonder this place
is so attractive to you...

269
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:15,291
Please, eat.

270
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:18,208
Jyotsna, do you remember
your special mutton curry?

271
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:19,375
How can I forget?

272
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:23,000
I asked him to check the taste once.

273
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,500
He tasted and said,
"But I didn't check the salt."

274
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:30,083
Next time he says,
"But I didn't check the spice."

275
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:36,041
Lastly, he says,
"But I didn't check if the mutton is done."

276
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:39,083
You're scoring high on food
since childhood.

277
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:44,375
Child prodigy! I always knew wordplay.
I wanted to be a lawyer.

278
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:50,333
Really? Do you know
what this table is called?

279
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:52,875
It's a table.
What's there to know?

280
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:54,375
There is.

281
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:59,666
This table, the bed...
These are legendary Lazarus furniture...

282
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:01,541
It's a British company.

283
00:21:04,375 --> 00:21:06,791
Wow! The shining story
of the dining table.

284
00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:10,041
What news of Nilu?

285
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:14,291
Must be roaming around somewhere.

286
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:17,083
He'll come home when he's hungry.

287
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:21,083
Completely jobless
and idling away his time.

288
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:23,541
He's a great boy!
He can climb trees really fast.

289
00:21:23,541 --> 00:21:28,541
A bit shy but you should see his aim
with a slingshot.

290
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:36,875
Oh no! How will we eat?

291
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:39,458
Come in.

292
00:21:59,333 --> 00:22:01,166
Listen carefully.

293
00:22:01,166 --> 00:22:05,583
Ring that bell
if you want to go out.

294
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:11,208
Sir would do the same.

295
00:22:12,041 --> 00:22:15,125
I still don't know how it all happened...

296
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:17,875
Don't step out alone at night.

297
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:19,875
Why are you scaring us?

298
00:22:19,875 --> 00:22:24,333
Actually, it's the abandoned side
of the house...

299
00:22:24,625 --> 00:22:27,125
Sir didn't have any superstitions.

300
00:22:27,125 --> 00:22:32,125
But even he saw strange creatures
in the dead of the night.

301
00:22:32,125 --> 00:22:33,791
What are you talking about?

302
00:22:33,791 --> 00:22:38,458
Let it be.
We'll discuss in the morning.

303
00:22:38,458 --> 00:22:39,708
Go to sleep.

304
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:44,125
Your uncle's ancestral ring is in the cupboard.
Please take it.

305
00:22:44,125 --> 00:22:46,625
Give it to your mother.

306
00:22:59,291 --> 00:23:01,875
Is that a diary?

307
00:23:01,875 --> 00:23:03,208
Let me see.

308
00:23:04,333 --> 00:23:07,916
Looks interesting.

309
00:23:15,291 --> 00:23:19,416
This ring has been in the family
since the time of Nrishinghonarayan.

310
00:23:19,416 --> 00:23:23,166
I've seen my uncle wear it all my life.

311
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,125
It's beautiful.

312
00:23:33,791 --> 00:23:37,291
With this on me,
no ghost can touch me.

313
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:38,833
I'm feeling confident already.

314
00:23:38,833 --> 00:23:42,958
But what if they come
for the ring itself?

315
00:23:43,958 --> 00:23:46,791
Ghosts don't exist.

316
00:23:46,791 --> 00:23:50,166
Do you know how many haunted houses
there are in Kolkata alone?

317
00:23:50,291 --> 00:23:54,125
They say Warren Hastings spirit is still roaming
the halls of the National Library.

318
00:23:54,125 --> 00:23:58,041
The revolutionaries' spirits are stuck
at the Writers' Building...

319
00:23:58,041 --> 00:23:58,708
Okay... Okay...

320
00:23:58,708 --> 00:24:02,250
Please continue with your lecture
on the haunted houses tomorrow.

321
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:05,791
- Let's sleep now. Good night.
- Good night.

322
00:24:09,833 --> 00:24:14,208
I hope I didn't scare you.

323
00:24:14,208 --> 00:24:17,500
How can you joke about
something so serious?

324
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,083
I'll have to go to the loo at night.

325
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:21,500
Do you want Mahadeb to escort me?

326
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:24,000
If you feel shy,
you can wake me up too.

327
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,541
I'm right by your side.

328
00:24:25,541 --> 00:24:30,166
Imagine you're in the loo
and the ghosts start singing.

329
00:24:30,166 --> 00:24:35,708
Please open the door...
Don't keep us waiting...

330
00:24:35,708 --> 00:24:39,125
You're annoying!

331
00:24:43,875 --> 00:24:52,291
We pray to you, Supreme Lord,
whose divine light illumines all realms...

332
00:24:52,291 --> 00:24:59,208
Will the ghosts of Manikantapur
understand your Sanskrit chants?

333
00:24:59,208 --> 00:25:03,708
May be you should recite
something more local.

334
00:25:05,958 --> 00:25:08,458
Funny... Very funny.

335
00:25:13,916 --> 00:25:19,333
The banshee is my daughter
The ghost is my son

336
00:25:24,166 --> 00:25:31,916
"Sides, Vasus, Arrows on the Moon
Alam's second brother, checkmated in Arakan.

337
00:25:45,041 --> 00:25:47,750
Interesting.

338
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,208
Abir...

339
00:25:54,125 --> 00:25:56,083
Abir...

340
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,750
Do you know Alam's brother?

341
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:00,916
Nope.

342
00:29:00,791 --> 00:29:03,500
Why didn't you wake me up?

343
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:06,083
You could've rung the bell.

344
00:29:06,083 --> 00:29:07,333
It's my fault.

345
00:29:07,333 --> 00:29:09,083
I scared him before bed.

346
00:29:09,083 --> 00:29:11,375
Maybe that caused the hallucinations...

347
00:29:11,375 --> 00:29:14,458
No, Sona'da, it wasn't a hallucination.
I saw it clearly.

348
00:29:14,458 --> 00:29:18,041
Staring at me from
outside the window.

349
00:29:18,041 --> 00:29:20,708
Ghastly! My heart jumped out
of my body.

350
00:29:20,708 --> 00:29:23,750
- Come on, Abir...
- I'm confident. There are ghosts in this house.

351
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:26,208
- A lot of people call this the haunted house.
- See?

352
00:29:26,208 --> 00:29:27,416
No, I haven't seen.

353
00:29:27,416 --> 00:29:28,875
Are you happy now?
Give me your hand.

354
00:29:28,875 --> 00:29:31,333
Shut up.
How long do you spend at home?

355
00:29:31,333 --> 00:29:32,625
You're out most of the time.

356
00:29:32,625 --> 00:29:35,291
How are you, nephew?

357
00:29:35,291 --> 00:29:38,958
You're already in trouble
it seems?

358
00:29:38,958 --> 00:29:43,125
- Mahadeb, can you bring us some tea?
- Yes, of course... Please sit.

359
00:29:43,958 --> 00:29:46,958
Please take a seat.

360
00:29:46,958 --> 00:29:49,958
This is what happens when you come
after such a long time.

361
00:29:50,083 --> 00:29:53,291
Hari Uncle would talk about you
all the time.

362
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:56,333
Akhilesh Uncle is my uncle's childhood friend.

363
00:29:56,333 --> 00:29:58,208
- Subarna Sen, my Sona'da.
- Hello.

364
00:29:58,208 --> 00:29:58,958
Hello.

365
00:29:58,958 --> 00:30:01,416
He's actually my uncle
but I call him a brother.

366
00:30:01,458 --> 00:30:04,583
He's returned after seven years
of teaching history at Oxford.

367
00:30:04,583 --> 00:30:07,708
A great cricketer while growing up.
And a champion at debates...

368
00:30:11,916 --> 00:30:15,875
I'm Jhinuk Majumdar.
I'm studying Comparative Literature in JU.

369
00:30:15,875 --> 00:30:22,333
Correct. Jhinuk Majumdar, JU,
Comparative Literature... On holiday now.

370
00:30:22,333 --> 00:30:24,000
Yes but...

371
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,916
- Subarna, your subject is history?
- Yes.

372
00:30:27,916 --> 00:30:31,416
Most of the romanticism in higher studies
lies in history.

373
00:30:31,416 --> 00:30:32,125
Absolutely.

374
00:30:32,125 --> 00:30:35,833
Bengalis must rewrite their history.

375
00:30:35,958 --> 00:30:39,541
The Bengalis are dying
of their own negligence.

376
00:30:39,541 --> 00:30:43,291
The stalwarts like Ramesh Chandra Majumdar,
Jadu Nath Sarkar, Atul Sur wrote...

377
00:30:43,291 --> 00:30:45,666
But nobody carried their work further.

378
00:30:45,666 --> 00:30:49,125
- What about Nihar Ranjan Ray?
- Right, Nihar Ray.

379
00:30:49,125 --> 00:30:51,833
The great historian of the Bengali people.

380
00:30:51,833 --> 00:30:54,625
He wrote the history of Bengalis.
You're right.

381
00:30:54,625 --> 00:30:58,791
Dad, history is all you like.
But law is not bad either.

382
00:30:59,291 --> 00:31:02,000
- Do you want some water?
- No, I'm fine.

383
00:31:02,041 --> 00:31:03,458
Jhinuk, what about law?

384
00:31:03,458 --> 00:31:09,541
Lawyers don't care about the weather.
They wear that black coat.

385
00:31:09,541 --> 00:31:12,625
They look quite smart.
Men in black.

386
00:31:12,625 --> 00:31:14,958
Jhinuk, you are right.

387
00:31:14,958 --> 00:31:18,291
Lawyers are way more interesting
than history professors.

388
00:31:18,291 --> 00:31:20,833
They're amazing with words.

389
00:31:20,833 --> 00:31:24,666
Yes and I admire people
who speak well.

390
00:31:24,666 --> 00:31:31,291
So, you like men in suits
and men who are articulate.

391
00:31:31,291 --> 00:31:32,208
- Right?
- Right.

392
00:31:32,208 --> 00:31:34,166
- Anything else?
- Sense of humour.

393
00:31:34,166 --> 00:31:37,583
That's a must and...

394
00:31:37,583 --> 00:31:41,583
The shoes must be perfect.

395
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,416
A gentleman is known by his shoes.

396
00:31:45,416 --> 00:31:48,458
And of course, fast cars, long drives.

397
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:53,583
Can we take a tour of the house?

398
00:31:53,583 --> 00:31:58,750
Jhinuk is the best tour guide
of this house.

399
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:01,958
She's been Hari's assistant
since she was a kid.

400
00:32:01,958 --> 00:32:04,750
- Sona'da, you'll love it.
- Then, let's go.

401
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:06,041
- And you?
- I'm coming.

402
00:32:06,041 --> 00:32:08,000
Let's go.

403
00:32:11,041 --> 00:32:14,625
- Jhinuk, do you like cooking?
- Yes, a lot.

404
00:32:14,625 --> 00:32:18,583
- And do you like to travel?
- So thrilling! I love it.

405
00:32:20,416 --> 00:32:24,666
Be careful what you ask for,
you might just get it.

406
00:32:25,458 --> 00:32:30,208
There were two guinea pigs
for Jhinuk's cooking experiments.

407
00:32:30,375 --> 00:32:32,833
Hari and I.

408
00:32:33,958 --> 00:32:35,625
Come.

409
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:42,208
Abir will have to visit this house
quite often now.

410
00:32:42,208 --> 00:32:46,708
Yes, he'll have to.
Subir doesn't have any time.

411
00:32:47,166 --> 00:32:51,333
Abir only will have to take care
of this house.

412
00:32:53,125 --> 00:32:56,625
- Akhilesh Uncle, Dad was saying...
- Daddy...

413
00:32:56,625 --> 00:32:59,875
It'll be difficult to take care of this house
from Kolkata, so...

414
00:32:59,875 --> 00:33:03,750
But that doesn't mean
you'll sell this house off.

415
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:07,000
Hari would have said the same thing.

416
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,125
Over the last few year,
Hari got a lot of offers.

417
00:33:10,208 --> 00:33:12,375
But he was very rigid.

418
00:33:12,416 --> 00:33:14,666
And I like that spirit.

419
00:33:14,666 --> 00:33:16,458
This is what Bengalis need.

420
00:33:16,458 --> 00:33:18,041
Hari would always say...

421
00:33:18,041 --> 00:33:20,541
"This 350 year old house
bears the history of my ancestors...

422
00:33:20,541 --> 00:33:24,750
"How can I sell my heritage
merely for some money?"

423
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:27,000
"Should I sell my existence?"

424
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,666
No, really. This is a historical place.

425
00:33:29,666 --> 00:33:31,750
This house was built in the Mughal period,
you know, Jhinuk.

426
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:34,583
Emperor Shah Jahan was on the throne.

427
00:33:34,833 --> 00:33:37,666
And his son Shah Shuja
was the Governor of Bengal.

428
00:33:37,666 --> 00:33:45,375
And Nrishinghonarayan Singho Ray
was the landlord of Manikantapur at the time.

429
00:33:45,375 --> 00:33:49,208
This place was called Ronghati then.

430
00:33:49,208 --> 00:33:53,750
There used to be a big market
beside the Rangini river.

431
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:55,916
So, you can imagine...

432
00:33:55,916 --> 00:34:02,625
Nrishinghonarayan had invited Shah Shuja
to this house at the time.

433
00:34:02,625 --> 00:34:04,958
Wow!

434
00:34:04,958 --> 00:34:08,708
This house has been a witness
to many episodes of Bengali history.

435
00:34:08,708 --> 00:34:13,333
How can you evaluate a property
like this with money?

436
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,500
Bengalis don't get it.

437
00:34:16,791 --> 00:34:20,583
Anyone else would have turned this house
into a heritage property.

438
00:34:20,583 --> 00:34:23,875
Unbelievable! Shah Jahan's son
had come to this house!

439
00:34:23,875 --> 00:34:26,125
Then it really is a historical place.

440
00:34:26,125 --> 00:34:28,666
How can you be so ignorant
about your own uncle's house?

441
00:34:28,666 --> 00:34:31,500
- When Shah Shuja was Bengal's Governor...
- Yes...

442
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:34,000
- ...Bengal was doing great in business...
- Absolutely.

443
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,666
Bengal was very rich at that time.

444
00:34:35,666 --> 00:34:41,041
Shah Shuja lost the Battle of Khajwa
to his brother Aurangazeb.

445
00:34:41,041 --> 00:34:42,708
He fled to Arakan.

446
00:34:42,708 --> 00:34:45,041
- And he was murdered in Arakan.
- Correct.

447
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:49,041
So, if he died in Arakan,
why is he still haunting this house?

448
00:34:49,041 --> 00:34:51,625
You're such a coward.

449
00:34:51,625 --> 00:34:55,625
You ate too much which means indigestion
and hallucination.

450
00:34:55,625 --> 00:34:59,041
I don't know if there are any ghosts...

451
00:34:59,125 --> 00:35:02,166
But in the last few years,
Hari would also say...

452
00:35:02,208 --> 00:35:05,291
...he spotted abnormal movements
around the house.

453
00:35:05,291 --> 00:35:07,916
It's true, Daddy.

454
00:35:07,916 --> 00:35:11,125
Uncle would walk around
in the abandoned part of the house.

455
00:35:11,125 --> 00:35:14,458
When we met the last time, he told me...

456
00:35:14,458 --> 00:35:18,208
"Let Abir come. There's a priceless surprise
waiting for him."

457
00:35:18,208 --> 00:35:20,666
This is for you.

458
00:35:20,708 --> 00:35:24,833
Sir had asked me to post this letter
the night he died.

459
00:35:24,833 --> 00:35:28,041
I completely forgot about it.

460
00:35:28,625 --> 00:35:33,833
"This letter is only for his eyes, dear
If anyone else opens it, I'll box your ears."

461
00:35:33,833 --> 00:35:36,458
This is strictly confidential.

462
00:35:36,458 --> 00:35:37,541
"Dear Abir,

463
00:35:37,541 --> 00:35:43,541
"Since you didn't come,
I'll not tell you the reason either.

464
00:35:43,791 --> 00:35:47,583
"I'm sending you a riddle.
Once you solve it, you'll come, I'm sure.

465
00:35:47,583 --> 00:35:50,500
" With blessings, Uncle."

466
00:35:52,166 --> 00:35:57,625
"Sides, Vasus, Arrows on the Moon
Alam's second brother, checkmated in Arakan.

467
00:36:05,041 --> 00:36:07,833
"Wannabe lawyer can you keep
your family's face?"

468
00:36:07,833 --> 00:36:09,125
Riddle?

469
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:10,791
Let me see.

470
00:36:12,083 --> 00:36:15,833
"Sides, Vasus, Arrows on the Moon
Alam's second brother, checkmated in Arakan.

471
00:36:20,541 --> 00:36:21,916
Interesting.

472
00:36:21,916 --> 00:36:23,791
Do you know what it means?

473
00:36:24,208 --> 00:36:28,458
"...Africa's treasure
Becomes Tuntuni's can."

474
00:36:33,125 --> 00:36:36,708
Maybe that'll give me some ideas.

475
00:36:36,708 --> 00:36:40,750
Look at this, Subarna.

476
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:45,416
One of the most precious historical
constructions of Bengal.

477
00:36:46,291 --> 00:36:49,416
Gorgeous and elegant.

478
00:36:49,416 --> 00:36:51,500
But neglected.

479
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:55,833
Another illustration
of our national indifference.

480
00:36:56,041 --> 00:37:00,166
Everything is falling apart, Subarna.

481
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:04,916
- You'll see similar construction in Bishnupur.
- Right.

482
00:37:04,958 --> 00:37:09,916
Using the basic architechtural structure
of rural homes...

483
00:37:09,958 --> 00:37:12,625
They have used terracotta work.

484
00:37:12,625 --> 00:37:15,791
This house has four parts.

485
00:37:15,791 --> 00:37:22,416
This temple, the main complex, the courtyard
and the inner complex.

486
00:37:22,416 --> 00:37:24,791
Everything else is falling apart.

487
00:37:24,791 --> 00:37:30,000
The residential complex survived
because Hari looked after it.

488
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:33,583
Amazing!

489
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,416
Abir, take a look at those epitaphs.

490
00:37:37,416 --> 00:37:42,958
You'll find a detailed timeline
of your maternal family there.

491
00:37:56,750 --> 00:37:59,708
Nilu, this wasn't here before!

492
00:37:59,708 --> 00:38:03,041
Sir had installed it a few days
before he died.

493
00:38:03,375 --> 00:38:08,125
Uncle, are you crazy?
You've installed your own epitaph?

494
00:38:08,125 --> 00:38:12,333
Really strange.
Even I haven't noticed it before.

495
00:38:13,041 --> 00:38:15,875
After Hari passed away,
I didn't come this side much.

496
00:38:15,875 --> 00:38:17,750
Maybe, that's why I didn't notice.

497
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:21,666
But the year of his birth is wrong.

498
00:38:21,666 --> 00:38:24,083
No, it's not wrong.

499
00:38:24,083 --> 00:38:29,041
All the other epitaphs have used
Saka era dates.

500
00:38:29,041 --> 00:38:34,833
Chandragupta II defeated the Sakas in 78 AD.
So that's when Saka era started.

501
00:38:34,833 --> 00:38:37,500
The Saka era calendar was prevalent
in Bengal at that time.

502
00:38:37,541 --> 00:38:39,916
So, if you add 78
with the Saka era year...

503
00:38:39,916 --> 00:38:41,375
Then you'll get
the Christian Era calendar dates.

504
00:38:41,375 --> 00:38:43,583
It says 1882 here.

505
00:38:43,583 --> 00:38:46,416
Let's add 78 to it.

506
00:38:46,458 --> 00:38:51,791
That makes it 1960
which is the year of Hari's birth.

507
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:57,750
Really, Hari, only you can do
something like this.

508
00:38:57,750 --> 00:38:59,833
Your riddles...

509
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:07,375
"Paint me before you depart..."

510
00:39:07,375 --> 00:39:09,500
Please sing the song...

511
00:39:11,083 --> 00:39:20,166
Paint me before you depart

512
00:39:20,791 --> 00:39:31,083
Paint me before you depart

513
00:39:31,416 --> 00:39:35,666
Paint me with yourself

514
00:39:35,666 --> 00:39:40,083
Paint me in your secrets

515
00:39:40,083 --> 00:39:50,250
Paint me in your youthful smile
And your painful tears

516
00:39:50,250 --> 00:40:02,416
Paint me before you depart

517
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:17,500
The colour should touch my heart
It should colour my deeds

518
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:27,208
Let it paint the blaze of the lamp
Let it keep me up at night

519
00:40:27,208 --> 00:40:40,291
Paint me before you depart

520
00:40:40,291 --> 00:40:49,208
Paint me before you depart

521
00:40:50,625 --> 00:40:54,000
Nilu, go with them.

522
00:40:54,583 --> 00:40:58,333
I'll go back home.

523
00:40:59,583 --> 00:41:03,041
You guys go ahead.

524
00:41:07,791 --> 00:41:10,958
What are you doing with those sticks?
Trying to scare ghosts?

525
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,375
Why? You don't know?

526
00:41:13,375 --> 00:41:16,000
Neem branches are very effective
against ghosts.

527
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,791
It can scare both snakes and ghosts.

528
00:41:17,791 --> 00:41:22,208
- Oh, two in one?
- What else?

529
00:41:22,375 --> 00:41:26,833
You won't believe... I entered the room...
looked at the window...

530
00:41:26,875 --> 00:41:27,958
Coward!

531
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,708
- There are lots of snakes around.
- Krait?

532
00:41:30,708 --> 00:41:33,208
No kraits here, Mr. Lawyer.

533
00:41:33,208 --> 00:41:34,708
They stay close to the paddy fields.

534
00:41:34,708 --> 00:41:36,708
This is gokhro's area.

535
00:41:36,708 --> 00:41:39,500
It's called king cobra in English.

536
00:41:39,541 --> 00:41:41,416
It looks like the cow's hoof...

537
00:41:41,541 --> 00:41:43,375
I'm sure you've never seen it.

538
00:41:43,375 --> 00:41:46,916
It has marks like that on the hood.
That's why the name.

539
00:41:46,916 --> 00:41:51,041
- There are cobras here.
- Really?

540
00:41:51,583 --> 00:41:53,666
Let's go.

541
00:41:53,875 --> 00:41:57,458
Hey, do you remember?
Come with me...

542
00:42:01,416 --> 00:42:05,458
Do you remember we used to play
hide and seek here?

543
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:09,458
I really would have missed out on a lot
if I didn't come here.

544
00:42:09,541 --> 00:42:13,958
It's falling apart a bit
but it's still gorgeous.

545
00:42:14,083 --> 00:42:16,333
Do you have anything like this
in your Kolkata?

546
00:42:16,625 --> 00:42:20,791
I might but it won't be so broken.

547
00:42:20,791 --> 00:42:22,958
You call this broken?

548
00:42:23,166 --> 00:42:25,750
- This is broken?
- Yes...

549
00:42:26,208 --> 00:42:27,958
- What are you doing?
- Let it go.

550
00:42:27,958 --> 00:42:29,208
- What are you doing?
- Why did you call it broken?

551
00:42:29,208 --> 00:42:30,541
Stop hitting me.

552
00:42:30,541 --> 00:42:33,000
- Where are you going? Wait...
- Jhinuk, please...

553
00:42:34,041 --> 00:42:36,416
- You can't run away like that...
- What are you doing?

554
00:42:36,416 --> 00:42:39,083
What did you call this place?

555
00:42:39,083 --> 00:42:41,041
You're dead if I catch you...

556
00:42:44,166 --> 00:42:48,041
- Are you okay?
- Oh god! It was about to crumble and fall.

557
00:42:48,041 --> 00:42:49,666
Okay, let's go.

558
00:42:53,958 --> 00:42:56,166
Small things like this happen
in old houses.

559
00:42:56,166 --> 00:42:58,000
Get it fixed.

560
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,833
Just ask the local mason.

561
00:42:59,833 --> 00:43:03,041
Have you seen the state it's in?

562
00:43:03,041 --> 00:43:06,125
Do you know how much time, energy, effort
and cost is needed to fix this?

563
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:08,625
I should just give up my studies
and do this.

564
00:43:08,791 --> 00:43:09,958
What do you mean?

565
00:43:10,208 --> 00:43:12,750
You have only solution.
Sell off the house.

566
00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:16,000
Sell it off.
Uncle would have never...

567
00:43:16,666 --> 00:43:20,958
So many memories, so much history...
Your uncle's memories...

568
00:43:21,208 --> 00:43:23,666
I hate lawyers.
I hate lawyers!

569
00:43:24,291 --> 00:43:25,833
Jhinuk!

570
00:43:25,833 --> 00:43:28,166
- There you are...
- I hate lawyers.

571
00:43:28,750 --> 00:43:31,666
Jhinuk! Sona'da, what's all this?

572
00:43:31,666 --> 00:43:35,166
- What did you tell her?
- I only told her about the practical problems.

573
00:43:35,166 --> 00:43:38,250
Jhinuk! Jhinuk!

574
00:43:46,583 --> 00:43:47,833
Jhinuk.

575
00:43:47,833 --> 00:43:48,625
What's the matter?

576
00:43:48,625 --> 00:43:50,125
Where are the onions, Jyotsna?

577
00:43:50,125 --> 00:43:53,666
- I think Abir wants more tea...
- Jhinuk...

578
00:43:55,291 --> 00:43:58,208
- So, what do you think?
- Outstanding!

579
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:00,833
- Can we see Uncle's study room?
- Jhinuk...

580
00:44:00,833 --> 00:44:02,916
Yes, of course.

581
00:44:02,916 --> 00:44:05,500
You'll love it. Let's go.

582
00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:09,250
- Bring Abir along.
- Yes.

583
00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:12,833
Mr. Outstanding... Study room...

584
00:44:13,541 --> 00:44:15,125
Come with me.

585
00:44:15,125 --> 00:44:18,583
Jyotsna, we'll be in the study room.

586
00:44:26,416 --> 00:44:28,791
Come in, Subarna.

587
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:32,041
Come in, Abir.

588
00:44:34,916 --> 00:44:37,666
This is a great collection.

589
00:44:38,375 --> 00:44:40,083
Hari would often joke...

590
00:44:40,083 --> 00:44:46,208
He fell so deeply in love with books
that he never had time for marriage.

591
00:44:46,291 --> 00:44:49,125
Akhilesh Uncle, it's the same with Sona'da.

592
00:44:49,125 --> 00:44:49,958
Is that so?

593
00:44:49,958 --> 00:44:52,083
That's the thing about books.

594
00:44:52,083 --> 00:44:53,916
It's not your cup of tea.

595
00:44:53,916 --> 00:44:55,333
Lawyers don't read books?

596
00:44:55,333 --> 00:44:58,416
My dad's office is full of books.
My office will also have books.

597
00:44:58,458 --> 00:45:00,833
But have you ever seen a lawyer
remaining unmarried because of books?

598
00:45:00,833 --> 00:45:01,750
TUNTUNI"S BOOK

599
00:45:02,541 --> 00:45:04,166
Well said.

600
00:45:04,291 --> 00:45:07,375
- Daddy.
- Come, darling.

601
00:45:08,083 --> 00:45:10,250
Here's your tea.
Lunch is getting ready.

602
00:45:10,333 --> 00:45:12,166
- Hey, Jhinuk...
- Daddy, your tea.

603
00:45:12,208 --> 00:45:14,083
Thanks.

604
00:45:14,833 --> 00:45:17,083
- Sona'da, this is for you.
- Jhinuk.

605
00:45:17,083 --> 00:45:18,291
Thank you.

606
00:45:18,333 --> 00:45:22,250
"Sides, Vasus, Arrows on the Moon
Alam's second brother..."

607
00:45:22,833 --> 00:45:25,750
Have you read Upendra Kishore
Ray Chowdhury's Tuntuni's book?

608
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:28,791
Can you tell me
what was in Tuntuni's house?

609
00:45:31,291 --> 00:45:33,916
Think, think. Practise thinking.

610
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,666
Because if you can answer...

611
00:45:35,666 --> 00:45:37,833
Then Africa's treasure will be in your hands.

612
00:45:37,875 --> 00:45:42,250
Subarna, now you've started talking
in riddles too.

613
00:45:42,250 --> 00:45:45,041
It was misfortune
that the missing coffer...

614
00:45:45,041 --> 00:45:47,583
...resulted in Tuntuni's empty home.

615
00:45:47,583 --> 00:45:49,125
Is that so?

616
00:45:49,125 --> 00:45:52,375
Okay we'll put Tuntuni aside for a bit.

617
00:45:52,375 --> 00:45:54,708
Let's concentrate on Africa.

618
00:45:54,750 --> 00:45:58,291
The first thing that comes to mind
when Africa is mentioned is jungle.

619
00:45:58,291 --> 00:46:02,708
- And the king of the jungle is...
- The lion.

620
00:46:02,708 --> 00:46:04,500
Very good.

621
00:46:04,958 --> 00:46:12,416
By lion's treasure he meant the Singho Ray's treasure
because "Singho" means lion.

622
00:46:12,416 --> 00:46:14,083
"Becomes Tuntuni's can."

623
00:46:16,583 --> 00:46:18,750
- What did Tuntuni say?
- What?

624
00:46:18,750 --> 00:46:22,625
" Whatever the king has in his treasure,
I have it in the same measure."

625
00:46:22,625 --> 00:46:28,208
Are you saying there's hidden treasure
in this Singho Ray house?

626
00:46:28,208 --> 00:46:29,791
Seems like it, sir.

627
00:46:29,833 --> 00:46:33,916
- There is one moon... Then, there are two...
- Sides.

628
00:46:33,916 --> 00:46:36,000
- There are three...
- Eyes!

629
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,833
- There are four...
- Vedas.

630
00:46:38,041 --> 00:46:40,791
- There are five arrows.
- There are six senses.

631
00:46:40,791 --> 00:46:43,666
There are seven seas.
What goes with eight?

632
00:46:43,666 --> 00:46:45,125
There are the eight "Vasus"
or wealth givers.

633
00:46:45,125 --> 00:46:46,625
There are nine planets.

634
00:46:46,625 --> 00:46:48,833
There are 10 directions.

635
00:46:49,958 --> 00:46:51,875
So, let's put it together.

636
00:46:51,875 --> 00:46:55,458
This was a unique traditional way
to count numbers in Bengal.

637
00:46:55,458 --> 00:46:58,791
Basically, you count with the objects.

638
00:46:58,791 --> 00:47:02,333
We have "Sides, Vasus,
Arrows on the Moon".

639
00:47:02,333 --> 00:47:07,750
So sides mean two. Vasu here is eight.
Arrow is five and moon is one.

640
00:47:10,083 --> 00:47:12,333
- 2851.
- Good.

641
00:47:12,333 --> 00:47:14,416
Now, we have to reverse it.

642
00:47:14,416 --> 00:47:16,625
This is called numerical reversal.

643
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:19,958
- What do we get if we reverse it, Jhinuk?
- 1582.

644
00:47:19,958 --> 00:47:22,416
1582 Saka Era.

645
00:47:22,416 --> 00:47:25,833
And now if we have to convert it
into the Christian Era?

646
00:47:25,833 --> 00:47:31,375
- We have to add 78.
- Yes, 82 plus 8 is 90. Plus 70.

647
00:47:31,375 --> 00:47:36,083
- That makes it 1660... Right.
- 1660 Christian Era. Correct.

648
00:47:36,083 --> 00:47:43,541
In 1660, Alamgir Aurangazeb killed
his second brother Shah Shuja in Arakan.

649
00:47:43,541 --> 00:47:45,750
Alam's second brother is Shuja.

650
00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:48,583
Shuja was murdered in distant Arakan.

651
00:47:48,750 --> 00:47:54,333
But it's Alam's misfortune
that he never got Shuja's wealth.

652
00:47:54,416 --> 00:47:57,083
Where did Shuja's treasure go?

653
00:47:57,083 --> 00:48:02,458
History says, Shuja hid his treasures
in Bengal...

654
00:48:02,458 --> 00:48:05,666
With his trusted stately princes
and landlords.

655
00:48:05,666 --> 00:48:09,375
Nrishighonarayan was a favourite of Shuja.

656
00:48:10,291 --> 00:48:14,875
Akhilesh Uncle has already told us
that Shuja had come to this house as a guest.

657
00:48:14,875 --> 00:48:17,708
So, we can assume...

658
00:48:18,125 --> 00:48:24,833
...that Shuja's wealth expanded
Singho Ray family's treasury.

659
00:48:24,833 --> 00:48:31,083
"Whatever the Mughals had in their treasure,
Singho Rays have it in the same measure."

660
00:48:31,083 --> 00:48:35,625
Shah Shuja's royal treasure
is in this house.

661
00:48:35,666 --> 00:48:40,250
Wow! There's hidden treasure
in this house?

662
00:48:40,833 --> 00:48:45,500
- In this...
- If what you're saying is true...

663
00:48:45,583 --> 00:48:48,208
- ...that would be an event of the century.
- True.

664
00:48:48,291 --> 00:48:50,416
And it'll be a great historic exploration too.

665
00:48:50,416 --> 00:48:55,916
Wow! That means this is
uncle's "priceless surprise".

666
00:48:55,916 --> 00:48:59,750
Sona'da, this is like the fabled treasure hunt
in a mythical mansion.

667
00:48:59,791 --> 00:49:01,875
Well said, Jhinuk.

668
00:49:01,875 --> 00:49:03,708
Hidden treasure of the mythical mansion!

669
00:49:03,708 --> 00:49:05,875
Can we find it?

670
00:49:05,875 --> 00:49:07,666
But you want to sell off the house.

671
00:49:07,666 --> 00:49:09,583
What? When?

672
00:49:09,583 --> 00:49:11,458
- No, no...
- Actually, the thing is.

673
00:49:11,708 --> 00:49:16,291
I am very sure there is hidden treasure
in Jhinuk's mythical mansion.

674
00:49:16,333 --> 00:49:20,375
I think your uncle asked you to come here
to tell you about the hidden treasure.

675
00:49:20,375 --> 00:49:23,208
You never showed up.
That's why he wrote his letter.

676
00:49:23,291 --> 00:49:29,083
Now we have to find the treasure
in his absence.

677
00:49:29,708 --> 00:49:32,250
He has not left us any clues.

678
00:49:32,250 --> 00:49:34,208
I should have cancelled my trek.

679
00:49:34,208 --> 00:49:36,125
Sona'da, is there nothing we can do?

680
00:49:36,125 --> 00:49:38,916
We'll have to dig up to look
for the hidden treasure.

681
00:49:38,916 --> 00:49:43,375
Will this house be able to withstand
an excavation?

682
00:49:44,166 --> 00:49:46,166
Don't be disappointed.

683
00:49:46,166 --> 00:49:48,000
Say we don't find the treasure...

684
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:53,291
But this house in itself is a treasure.
Isn't it?

685
00:49:53,291 --> 00:49:54,958
- Yes, absolutely...
- You're right.

686
00:49:54,958 --> 00:49:58,291
- But the treasure is lost?
- Serves you right.

687
00:49:58,541 --> 00:50:04,125
We'll take it up later.
Let's eat first.

688
00:50:04,125 --> 00:50:07,583
Good idea. Please eat something.

689
00:50:08,083 --> 00:50:10,375
I'm not hungry.

690
00:50:10,458 --> 00:50:13,625
You are not hungry?
How did that happen?

691
00:50:13,625 --> 00:50:17,458
I was scared out of my wits last night.
And today, the treasure is gone.

692
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:19,625
How can I eat in this mood?

693
00:50:19,625 --> 00:50:21,333
Eat up.

694
00:50:21,875 --> 00:50:26,375
If your uncle can find the hidden treasure all
by himself...

695
00:50:26,375 --> 00:50:30,500
Will Subarna Sen let go
of this challenge so easily?

696
00:50:30,625 --> 00:50:33,000
Don't worry. Let's see.

697
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:36,250
The treasure of this mythical mansion...

698
00:50:36,250 --> 00:50:40,250
Let's see if we can deliver it to
Nrishingonarayan's heir, Abir Lal Roy.

699
00:50:40,333 --> 00:50:43,625
Jyotsna, please bring
some more food, quickly.

700
00:50:43,625 --> 00:50:46,791
My appetite just multiplied.

701
00:50:46,916 --> 00:50:49,125
Bravo, Subarna!

702
00:50:49,625 --> 00:50:52,583
- That's the spirit. Best of luck.
- Thank you.

703
00:50:52,708 --> 00:50:57,916
The zest for adventure in Bengalis
is dwindling.

704
00:50:58,291 --> 00:50:59,875
But be careful.

705
00:51:00,625 --> 00:51:03,708
Once news of the hidden treasure
becomes public...

706
00:51:03,708 --> 00:51:07,583
...villians will surely pounce on it.

707
00:51:07,583 --> 00:51:10,458
Can you imagine?
Shah Jahan's son's treasure!

708
00:51:10,458 --> 00:51:14,333
I won't be surprised if international criminals
also gather up in Manikantapur.

709
00:51:14,458 --> 00:51:17,708
Mr. Lawyer has found his criminals here too.

710
00:51:17,708 --> 00:51:20,833
That too international criminals.

711
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,083
Here...

712
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:31,666
I want some spinach
and cauliflower.

713
00:51:31,833 --> 00:51:33,250
I'll be right back...

714
00:51:33,250 --> 00:51:35,541
- See, she's run off again.
- Stick with her.

715
00:51:38,750 --> 00:51:42,500
- What are you doing? Let's go.
- Wait... Okay, let's go.

716
00:51:53,125 --> 00:51:56,500
- Sona'da, how about a boat ride?
- Let's do it...

717
00:51:56,750 --> 00:51:59,333
Great! Let me arrange it.

718
00:52:00,041 --> 00:52:01,500
Boat ride?

719
00:52:01,750 --> 00:52:02,916
Come on.

720
00:52:03,291 --> 00:52:05,958
Come quickly.

721
00:52:22,166 --> 00:52:25,875
That was beautiful!
May I play?

722
00:53:00,750 --> 00:53:01,625
Thank you.

723
00:53:01,708 --> 00:53:06,875
Sona'da, cricket, history
and now flute too... Brilliant!

724
00:53:06,875 --> 00:53:07,541
Thank you.

725
00:53:07,541 --> 00:53:10,041
- Come, the boat's ready.
- Let's go.

726
00:53:10,625 --> 00:53:11,875
- Sona'da...
- Now, what?

727
00:53:11,875 --> 00:53:13,416
- Do we really have to go on the boat?
- Yes.

728
00:53:13,416 --> 00:53:15,041
I can't swim.

729
00:53:15,041 --> 00:53:16,041
You don't need to.

730
00:53:18,208 --> 00:53:22,125
- I hope there are no crocodiles.
- Nope.

731
00:53:22,125 --> 00:53:24,208
- Sharks?
- Not there.

732
00:53:24,208 --> 00:53:26,333
- Octopus?
- Abir, come.

733
00:53:26,333 --> 00:53:27,750
Coming...

734
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,750
Move ahead.

735
00:53:39,791 --> 00:53:41,666
Carefully... Slowly...

736
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,041
- Are you okay? Good.
- Yes, yes...

737
00:53:47,041 --> 00:53:48,500
Sit.

738
00:54:20,416 --> 00:54:22,916
- Jhinuk, just think about it.
- Yeah...

739
00:54:23,166 --> 00:54:28,583
A few centuries ago, Shah Shuja
had travelled by this river Rangini...

740
00:54:28,916 --> 00:54:32,041
And with him he carried
his royal treasure.

741
00:54:32,250 --> 00:54:34,000
Relax.

742
00:54:36,833 --> 00:54:38,166
It's okay.

743
00:54:40,708 --> 00:54:43,250
That's great!

744
00:54:43,250 --> 00:54:45,583
The three stooges are together.

745
00:54:45,708 --> 00:54:48,291
We have rain without clouds it seems.

746
00:54:48,375 --> 00:54:54,375
Go ahead, give them a dip
in the Rangini river.

747
00:54:54,375 --> 00:54:56,625
If they leave, it's good.

748
00:54:56,625 --> 00:54:58,958
Otherwise, we'll increase the dosage.

749
00:55:19,291 --> 00:55:20,000
What's this?

750
00:55:20,791 --> 00:55:22,000
- What are you doing?
- Oh god!

751
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:22,583
Stop it!

752
00:55:22,583 --> 00:55:24,375
Abir! Sona'da!

753
00:55:24,375 --> 00:55:26,416
- What are you doing?
- What's wrong?

754
00:55:26,416 --> 00:55:27,916
- Water is coming into the boat...
- Oh no!

755
00:55:27,916 --> 00:55:31,916
- They're flooding the boat...
- What are you doing?

756
00:55:31,916 --> 00:55:35,125
Boatman, water is flooding the boat!

757
00:55:35,125 --> 00:55:35,916
What the hell!

758
00:55:35,916 --> 00:55:38,375
- Can we reach the bank?
- No, sir. We've to swim across.

759
00:55:38,375 --> 00:55:39,875
- We have to swim?
- I can't...

760
00:55:39,875 --> 00:55:42,291
- I can't swim...
- Abir, calm down.

761
00:55:42,291 --> 00:55:44,833
- Abir, we have to jump.
- I can't do it.

762
00:55:44,833 --> 00:55:47,541
- Abir, we have to! Don't be scared.
- Are you sure there's nothing in the water?

763
00:55:47,541 --> 00:55:50,791
Just be careful...
Let's go, Abir!

764
00:56:03,708 --> 00:56:05,166
Careful.

765
00:56:07,291 --> 00:56:10,000
- Slowly...
- Come carefully...

766
00:56:14,375 --> 00:56:15,916
Abir, be careful.

767
00:56:16,291 --> 00:56:17,666
Slowly, slowly...

768
00:56:22,458 --> 00:56:23,083
Sit down.

769
00:56:23,083 --> 00:56:24,291
Attempt to murder!

770
00:56:24,291 --> 00:56:26,125
- IPC Section 307.
- It's okay.

771
00:56:26,125 --> 00:56:27,958
Just calm down.
We'll figure it out.

772
00:56:27,958 --> 00:56:29,750
But who were they?

773
00:56:30,291 --> 00:56:34,125
Rivals of the treasure hunt
are already flocking to Manikantapur.

774
00:56:34,375 --> 00:56:39,333
I must find the treasure
for you.

775
00:56:39,333 --> 00:56:40,666
Otherwise, it might go into
the wrong hands.

776
00:56:40,666 --> 00:56:42,458
- What?
- What?

777
00:56:42,458 --> 00:56:47,875
Someone also knows
about the treasure...

778
00:56:47,875 --> 00:56:49,833
...who don't want us to find it.

779
00:56:50,541 --> 00:56:51,500
What do you mean?

780
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:55,875
Nothing to be scared of.
Let's go home.

781
00:56:57,791 --> 00:56:58,541
Let's go.

782
00:57:00,166 --> 00:57:01,666
That's enough.

783
00:57:03,291 --> 00:57:06,333
If this works out then great.

784
00:57:06,333 --> 00:57:10,041
Otherwise, skin them
and drown them in Rangini.

785
00:57:10,708 --> 00:57:12,375
Talk to you later.

786
00:57:14,041 --> 00:57:20,750
Dasanan Daw is going
to the Singho Ray palace.

787
00:57:31,041 --> 00:57:32,958
The water was freezing.

788
00:57:32,958 --> 00:57:34,458
I'll sneeze my lungs out.

789
00:57:34,458 --> 00:57:38,416
- Who is this guy?
- Dasanan. Dasanan Daw.

790
00:57:38,416 --> 00:57:41,000
His forefathers used
to be managers for this house.

791
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:44,125
He's made some money recently.

792
00:57:44,291 --> 00:57:46,083
He's not a good guy.

793
00:57:46,083 --> 00:57:47,708
He's approached your uncle
several times.

794
00:57:47,708 --> 00:57:49,750
Your uncle didn't like him at all.

795
00:57:50,291 --> 00:57:52,333
- So, what does he do now?
- Nothing good.

796
00:57:52,333 --> 00:57:54,041
He's involved in all sorts
of shady business.

797
00:57:54,083 --> 00:57:56,083
I heard he's going to run
for the election this time.

798
00:57:56,166 --> 00:57:57,333
Got it.

799
00:57:57,541 --> 00:58:00,583
It's the arrival of King of Lanka,
Ravana himself to the Singho Ray mansion.

800
00:58:00,625 --> 00:58:01,791
Let's go.

801
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:33,333
Abir, have you caught a cold?

802
00:58:33,333 --> 00:58:35,083
You're a city boy.

803
00:58:38,750 --> 00:58:40,958
Good evening, History sir!

804
00:58:41,666 --> 00:58:47,583
Did you find anything of historical importance
in this dilapidated house?

805
00:58:47,583 --> 00:58:48,666
Wow!

806
00:58:49,041 --> 00:58:51,833
You've done your homework well,
it seems.

807
00:58:53,916 --> 00:58:55,458
What are you saying?

808
00:58:56,333 --> 00:58:58,041
I am Dasanan Daw.

809
00:58:58,291 --> 00:59:01,458
I'm just a helping hand
to the ordinary people.

810
00:59:01,666 --> 00:59:07,000
And I have a deep connection
with this house.

811
00:59:07,125 --> 00:59:08,666
What do you mean?

812
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,125
My grandfather's father...

813
00:59:11,125 --> 00:59:14,583
...and his father and his father
and his father...

814
00:59:14,791 --> 00:59:18,375
They all worked for the Singho Ray family.

815
00:59:18,375 --> 00:59:19,833
But more importantly.

816
00:59:20,041 --> 00:59:25,500
Your afternoon boating session
was really a bad idea.

817
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:27,333
Just see...

818
00:59:28,541 --> 00:59:31,250
Now, he has a cold.

819
00:59:32,250 --> 00:59:35,125
One has to be careful.

820
00:59:35,125 --> 00:59:38,750
Without news, what's my use?

821
00:59:39,958 --> 00:59:43,833
Sir, there's pressure on me
to run in the elections.

822
00:59:43,833 --> 00:59:45,416
Vote on Daw's symbol, the axe.

823
00:59:45,416 --> 00:59:47,541
If not you'll be in the cracks.

824
00:59:49,125 --> 00:59:54,708
Have you inherited this immense love
for him from your ancestors?

825
00:59:55,083 --> 00:59:56,583
Mr. Subarna...

826
00:59:58,291 --> 01:00:03,333
My ancestors would bow their heads
when they entered this house.

827
01:00:05,708 --> 01:00:07,250
But I...

828
01:00:08,583 --> 01:00:11,750
I want to buy the house.

829
01:00:12,208 --> 01:00:14,791
The deal was almost finalised
with Harinarayan but...

830
01:00:14,791 --> 01:00:18,000
...he lost his life to a ghost...

831
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,041
I would have spoken to your father too.

832
01:00:21,041 --> 01:00:23,083
But I never got the time.

833
01:00:23,083 --> 01:00:26,458
But as owners,
we should want to sell.

834
01:00:28,583 --> 01:00:33,458
But you'll have to live here first, nephew.

835
01:00:34,416 --> 01:00:36,291
You'll be in Kolkata.

836
01:00:36,333 --> 01:00:38,541
You'll visit your uncle's house rarely.

837
01:00:38,625 --> 01:00:41,291
But Akhilesh Majumdar will live here.

838
01:00:41,666 --> 01:00:44,500
A sweet girl like Jhinuk will be here.

839
01:00:44,583 --> 01:00:48,125
No one knows when
there might be another accident.

840
01:00:48,125 --> 01:00:51,041
You saw it yourself today.

841
01:00:52,166 --> 01:00:54,958
What a horrible incident!

842
01:00:58,125 --> 01:01:03,500
You think you deserve this property
just because you're Hari's nephew?

843
01:01:03,708 --> 01:01:07,333
My father, Late Pachanan Daw...

844
01:01:07,583 --> 01:01:10,541
My grandfather, Late Gajanan Daw...

845
01:01:10,541 --> 01:01:13,250
My great grandfather, Late Shadanan Daw...

846
01:01:13,250 --> 01:01:17,833
Even his father... My entire family
has toiled so hard for this house...

847
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:21,083
They donated their entire life.

848
01:01:21,083 --> 01:01:22,375
What was it worth?

849
01:01:22,375 --> 01:01:23,333
That's true.

850
01:01:23,958 --> 01:01:30,333
We're very impressed by your loyalty.

851
01:01:30,416 --> 01:01:32,416
You'll be even more impressed
when you realise...

852
01:01:32,416 --> 01:01:36,250
...that his father is practising law
in Kolkata.

853
01:01:36,416 --> 01:01:39,416
And he too will be practising law
in Kolkata.

854
01:01:39,416 --> 01:01:41,083
He'll build his career there.

855
01:01:41,166 --> 01:01:47,291
And my family will work itself to death
for this family here in Manikantapur.

856
01:01:47,375 --> 01:01:54,208
After all this, I should be getting this house
for free.

857
01:01:54,208 --> 01:01:57,833
And here I am, offering the nephew a price.

858
01:01:58,125 --> 01:02:03,000
Strange times!

859
01:02:03,500 --> 01:02:07,083
You should never let go of a good offer.

860
01:02:07,083 --> 01:02:11,083
I'll give you 25 lakhs
for the entire property.

861
01:02:11,416 --> 01:02:13,250
25 lakhs!

862
01:02:13,250 --> 01:02:14,791
Think about it.

863
01:02:14,958 --> 01:02:16,333
And think fast.

864
01:02:16,583 --> 01:02:18,500
Discuss it with your father.

865
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,875
Just remember one thing.

866
01:02:21,833 --> 01:02:24,333
I'm not very "patient".

867
01:02:26,375 --> 01:02:27,250
Bye.

868
01:02:37,125 --> 01:02:41,125
- Sona'da, he's the villian...
- Yes, the mobster of Manikantapur.

869
01:02:41,625 --> 01:02:43,166
Just imagine the stress.

870
01:02:43,791 --> 01:02:45,125
The ghost, last night...

871
01:02:45,166 --> 01:02:46,166
The accident on the river...

872
01:02:46,166 --> 01:02:47,500
And now an impatient mobster.

873
01:02:47,541 --> 01:02:50,458
Add to that Jhinuk's wrath
and Uncle's riddles.

874
01:02:50,958 --> 01:02:57,916
Dasanan probably got to know
about the treasure from his family.

875
01:02:57,958 --> 01:02:59,625
I'm sure he did.

876
01:02:59,625 --> 01:03:01,500
Just look at his name.
Dasanan meaning ten faced.

877
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:02,875
I feel like spraying pest repellent
on all his faces.

878
01:03:02,875 --> 01:03:04,708
I had something else in mind.

879
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,041
Last night's ghost attack on you...

880
01:03:07,041 --> 01:03:09,041
And today's boat accident.

881
01:03:09,250 --> 01:03:11,291
Are they connected?

882
01:03:11,291 --> 01:03:13,000
The basic purpose is the same.

883
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,625
If they can scare us away,
then they win.

884
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:17,291
But Sona'da the ghost was real.

885
01:03:17,291 --> 01:03:19,375
I swear. I saw it.
It was real.

886
01:03:19,750 --> 01:03:20,666
Okay...

887
01:03:22,708 --> 01:03:23,500
What happened?

888
01:03:25,416 --> 01:03:27,833
That was just an empty threat, right?

889
01:03:28,750 --> 01:03:30,916
They won't harm Jhinuk.

890
01:03:33,583 --> 01:03:35,125
Don't worry.

891
01:03:35,666 --> 01:03:39,416
Don't be scared, my warrior, Abir!
Let's go.

892
01:05:02,833 --> 01:05:04,250
Dear Abir,

893
01:05:04,291 --> 01:05:06,208
Since you're reading this letter...

894
01:05:06,208 --> 01:05:10,750
I'm not around to give you
the solution of the riddle.

895
01:05:10,958 --> 01:05:13,000
You've figured it out right.

896
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:17,958
Shah Shuja's treasure is hidden
in the Singho Ray mansion.

897
01:05:18,125 --> 01:05:20,583
And I have found it.

898
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:25,583
This treasure was entrusted by Emperor
Alamgir's second brother, Prince Shuja...

899
01:05:25,583 --> 01:05:30,041
...to our ancestor Nrishinghonarayan.

900
01:05:30,041 --> 01:05:35,500
The Singho Ray family has protected
this treasure with all it's might.

901
01:05:35,666 --> 01:05:40,333
I'm leaving some clues behind for you
to unearth this hidden treasure.

902
01:05:40,833 --> 01:05:43,041
Wish you all the best.

903
01:05:45,375 --> 01:05:49,958
"A wonderful piece of fish makes
Krishna dance with his love.

904
01:05:49,958 --> 01:05:55,500
"One bite of the chicken drumstick
The Vaishnavite gives his faith a shove."

905
01:06:01,083 --> 01:06:04,583
No trouble at all.
Jyostna is taking very good care of us.

906
01:06:04,583 --> 01:06:06,166
And that Dasanan...

907
01:06:08,458 --> 01:06:12,833
What I meant was my diet
is off the charts...

908
01:06:13,250 --> 01:06:14,625
Who had come over?

909
01:06:15,333 --> 01:06:17,333
What did D'souza want?

910
01:06:18,125 --> 01:06:22,208
Class notes?
Let me first handle Shuja then D'souza.

911
01:06:23,208 --> 01:06:27,333
Mom, I'll call you back later.
Bye.

912
01:06:27,500 --> 01:06:29,083
- Do you have to tell her...
- One second.

913
01:06:29,083 --> 01:06:30,416
Yeah, Jhinuk...

914
01:06:30,833 --> 01:06:32,958
Hope you are okay.

915
01:06:36,041 --> 01:06:39,125
That's nothing. I'll go back
and learn swimming.

916
01:06:39,125 --> 01:06:40,333
Yes...

917
01:06:40,333 --> 01:06:42,375
Jhinuk, this is Sona'da.

918
01:06:42,375 --> 01:06:43,333
Give me the phone...

919
01:06:43,333 --> 01:06:45,458
We've got a new riddle.
We've to solve it.

920
01:06:45,458 --> 01:06:46,958
New riddle?
Where did you find it?

921
01:06:46,958 --> 01:06:48,916
But before that tell me something...

922
01:06:48,916 --> 01:06:51,083
There were symbols drawn
in the last riddle.

923
01:06:51,125 --> 01:06:52,208
Do you remember them?

924
01:06:52,250 --> 01:06:55,375
Yeah, one ace of hearts and one spade.

925
01:06:55,375 --> 01:06:56,208
Correct.

926
01:06:56,708 --> 01:06:59,166
Those symbols were meant
to be clues.

927
01:06:59,416 --> 01:07:02,166
And guess what I just found
in Uncle's study room?

928
01:07:02,458 --> 01:07:05,625
A container to keep betel leaf
that resembles the symbols.

929
01:07:05,625 --> 01:07:08,458
Really? I would keep a betel leaf ready
for uncle everyday in that container.

930
01:07:08,500 --> 01:07:10,125
Great!

931
01:07:10,583 --> 01:07:13,291
The new riddle was hidden
in that container.

932
01:07:13,541 --> 01:07:15,083
Sona'da, please read out the riddle.

933
01:07:15,291 --> 01:07:19,041
"A wonderful piece of fish makes
Krishna dance with his love.

934
01:07:19,041 --> 01:07:23,125
" One bite of the chicken drumstick
The Vaishnavite gives his faith a shove."

935
01:07:27,833 --> 01:07:31,000
And Vaishnavism bans fish and meat.

936
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:35,708
And still Lord Krishna is eating fish?

937
01:07:35,708 --> 01:07:40,125
And a Vaishnava is eating
a chicken drumstick?

938
01:07:40,833 --> 01:07:42,541
Very good, Jhinuk.

939
01:07:42,541 --> 01:07:48,416
Your sense of logic is much better
than my lawyer nephew.

940
01:07:48,416 --> 01:07:51,208
Please try to teach him a little.

941
01:07:51,666 --> 01:07:53,416
What rubbish!

942
01:07:53,833 --> 01:07:56,541
Let me know if you solve the riddle. Bye.

943
01:07:56,666 --> 01:07:58,916
The hidden treasure exists.
Uncle has confirmed it.

944
01:07:58,916 --> 01:08:00,000
I'm sure about it.

945
01:08:00,083 --> 01:08:01,958
Even I'm sure but...

946
01:08:02,041 --> 01:08:04,708
Who is this non-vegetarian Lord Krishna?
Can't figure that out.

947
01:08:04,750 --> 01:08:08,708
I don't know about vegetarian or not.
But Lord Krishna was really fond of food.

948
01:08:08,708 --> 01:08:12,083
You have to be a foodie to solve
this appetizer riddle.

949
01:08:12,083 --> 01:08:13,750
I'm very hungry now. Let's eat.

950
01:08:13,750 --> 01:08:16,458
Appetizer? Abir?

951
01:08:16,625 --> 01:08:19,250
You struggle with your magical piece of fish...

952
01:08:19,250 --> 01:08:20,583
What fish is this?

953
01:08:20,583 --> 01:08:23,208
It's carp, fresh from the pond.
Taste it.

954
01:08:23,208 --> 01:08:25,166
I've made it spicy, just the way you like it.

955
01:08:25,583 --> 01:08:30,083
Wow! I'm drooling already.

956
01:08:30,333 --> 01:08:32,958
And some lentils with fish head
to go along with it.

957
01:08:33,041 --> 01:08:35,375
Even if we don't have gold and riches,
we still have the golden lentil.

958
01:08:35,375 --> 01:08:39,458
Such an elaborate dinner on the Lazarus table...

959
01:08:39,583 --> 01:08:41,875
And then a good night's sleep
on the Lazarus bed...

960
01:08:41,875 --> 01:08:45,125
After a few days, we'll feel
like the Lords of Manikantapur...

961
01:08:45,125 --> 01:08:52,000
If the days go by like this
Let's enjoy the bliss

962
01:09:00,666 --> 01:09:02,916
Damn it! Again?

963
01:09:06,041 --> 01:09:07,708
I over ate again...

964
01:09:07,791 --> 01:09:09,458
I'm going for walks from tomorrow.

965
01:09:09,458 --> 01:09:10,833
I'm done.

966
01:09:11,333 --> 01:09:13,375
How do you do it?

967
01:09:13,375 --> 01:09:14,750
You make it look so easy.

968
01:09:15,625 --> 01:09:19,750
Honestly, I'm jealous
of your gifted metabolic rate.

969
01:09:19,833 --> 01:09:21,708
You have to be active, bro.

970
01:09:21,708 --> 01:09:22,916
Got it.

971
01:09:23,250 --> 01:09:25,416
What's your decision
about this house?

972
01:09:25,416 --> 01:09:27,125
Very simple.

973
01:09:27,125 --> 01:09:28,875
This house is not for sale.

974
01:09:28,875 --> 01:09:31,708
Jhinuk will never forgive me
if we sell this house.

975
01:09:31,708 --> 01:09:33,291
I won't be spared.

976
01:09:33,333 --> 01:09:34,625
Very good.

977
01:09:34,916 --> 01:09:38,916
So, you're not selling this house
because you're scared of Jhinuk.

978
01:09:38,916 --> 01:09:40,875
When did I say that?

979
01:09:41,083 --> 01:09:42,750
And there had to be a power cut now...

980
01:09:42,750 --> 01:09:44,333
What if I have to go to the loo at night?

981
01:09:44,458 --> 01:09:45,916
That's why I didn't drink enough water.

982
01:09:45,916 --> 01:09:47,458
There was no space for water either.

983
01:09:47,458 --> 01:09:49,833
Please think about something else.
Think postive.

984
01:09:49,833 --> 01:09:51,250
I was thinking positively.

985
01:09:51,250 --> 01:09:54,333
- About the fresh carp... the fish tail...
- Oh no...

986
01:09:54,416 --> 01:09:55,708
About Lazarus' furniture...

987
01:09:55,708 --> 01:09:58,208
Only this power cut is a downer...

988
01:09:58,583 --> 01:10:00,875
- Are you sure it's not fear?
- Nope...

989
01:10:01,250 --> 01:10:04,125
- Can I tell you a poem?
- Oh no! Please go ahead.

990
01:10:04,458 --> 01:10:07,083
Enjoying the fish's tail on the Lazarus
at night time...

991
01:10:07,083 --> 01:10:08,625
- Got it?
- Yes, next...

992
01:10:09,250 --> 01:10:11,833
Enjoying the fish's tail on the Lazarus
at night time...

993
01:10:11,833 --> 01:10:14,458
Possible or not,
you have to make it rhyme.

994
01:10:14,458 --> 01:10:16,125
There you go! Wow!

995
01:10:16,125 --> 01:10:18,000
Enjoying the fish's tail on the Lazarus
at night time...

996
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,416
Possible or not,
you have to make it rhyme.

997
01:10:22,208 --> 01:10:23,583
Bravo! You've cracked it!
Let's go.

998
01:10:23,583 --> 01:10:25,541
- What did I do now? Wait.
- Let's go.

999
01:10:41,541 --> 01:10:44,166
- Do you remember the riddle?
- Of course... It's about food.

1000
01:10:44,416 --> 01:10:46,791
"A wonderful piece of fish makes
Krishna dance with his love.

1001
01:10:46,791 --> 01:10:49,125
" One bite of the chicken drumstick
The Vaishnavite gives his religion a shove."

1002
01:10:54,458 --> 01:10:57,083
Your wonderful piece of fish is the tail.
In Bengali that's "leja".

1003
01:10:57,083 --> 01:10:59,625
And Lord Krishna's dance is the "Ras".

1004
01:10:59,625 --> 01:11:02,375
- So when you add them up...
- Lazarus?

1005
01:11:02,500 --> 01:11:04,666
This must be the leg piece.
Hold the torch.

1006
01:11:06,541 --> 01:11:08,333
What's this?

1007
01:11:09,416 --> 01:11:11,541
Point the torch here.
Let me see.

1008
01:11:11,916 --> 01:11:13,250
Oh!

1009
01:11:13,500 --> 01:11:14,875
It says, " Bravo, Abir!"

1010
01:11:14,875 --> 01:11:15,958
What next?

1011
01:11:15,958 --> 01:11:18,833
" One bite of the chicken drumstick
The Vaishnavite gives his faith a shove."

1012
01:11:34,625 --> 01:11:36,625
Who... Who's there?

1013
01:11:40,666 --> 01:11:42,041
What are you doing here, Nilu?

1014
01:11:42,041 --> 01:11:44,625
Just came to check
if you need water.

1015
01:11:44,625 --> 01:11:46,458
Why were you standing in the shadows
like a ghost?

1016
01:11:47,083 --> 01:11:50,458
- Do you need water?
- No, you can leave.

1017
01:11:52,916 --> 01:11:54,208
Nonsense!

1018
01:11:54,416 --> 01:11:55,833
Why was he standing there?

1019
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:57,958
We'll have to make some notes.

1020
01:12:05,833 --> 01:12:09,666
The rest of them were words.
But this one is just numbers.

1021
01:12:09,833 --> 01:12:11,625
Numbers but...

1022
01:12:11,958 --> 01:12:16,750
But they're not just random numbers.

1023
01:12:16,875 --> 01:12:20,791
"Dear Abir, let's burst your bubble
Here's an A-1 puzzle."

1024
01:12:21,375 --> 01:12:22,916
This is a bell cipher.

1025
01:12:25,125 --> 01:12:29,625
In the 19th century, Thomas Bell,
an American...

1026
01:12:29,708 --> 01:12:33,041
...left the clue to all his wealth
with an innkeeper.

1027
01:12:33,625 --> 01:12:34,791
He left without a trace.

1028
01:12:34,791 --> 01:12:38,833
Many years later, it was found out
that the first three pages...

1029
01:12:38,833 --> 01:12:40,583
...were full of numbers written like this.

1030
01:12:40,583 --> 01:12:42,041
That was the bell cipher.

1031
01:12:42,458 --> 01:12:45,333
Guess how much time it took
to solve it?

1032
01:12:45,333 --> 01:12:46,125
How much?

1033
01:12:46,125 --> 01:12:49,000
- 25 long years.
- 25 years?

1034
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:50,333
And this?

1035
01:12:50,833 --> 01:12:52,750
I have only one regret.

1036
01:12:53,125 --> 01:12:57,208
I could never meet your uncle in person.

1037
01:12:57,250 --> 01:13:00,416
One game to another... Brilliant!

1038
01:13:00,666 --> 01:13:02,958
You call this a game?

1039
01:13:03,166 --> 01:13:06,541
My head is getting tied up
in knots.

1040
01:13:06,833 --> 01:13:11,500
Serves you right for ignoring your uncle
and going on a trek.

1041
01:13:11,500 --> 01:13:14,625
So many tricks just
because of one trek?

1042
01:13:14,625 --> 01:13:17,208
This is not tricking.
This is tracking.

1043
01:13:17,291 --> 01:13:19,083
From one track to another.

1044
01:13:19,250 --> 01:13:22,625
One riddle leading to another.

1045
01:13:22,750 --> 01:13:26,833
After all, this is the adventure
of the mythical mansion.

1046
01:13:27,416 --> 01:13:29,458
- See you.
- Where are you going?

1047
01:13:29,625 --> 01:13:33,500
You better get some sleep.
I'll take a walk.

1048
01:13:33,500 --> 01:13:35,541
- Are you going out at night?
- Yes.

1049
01:13:35,666 --> 01:13:39,500
Because night has it's own beauty.
Got it, your lordship?

1050
01:13:39,500 --> 01:13:41,125
Don't take that...

1051
01:13:41,125 --> 01:13:43,625
There's enough light in the room.
Keep your phone close.

1052
01:13:43,625 --> 01:13:45,916
Call me if you need anything.

1053
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,375
You're kidding, right?

1054
01:13:47,375 --> 01:13:48,833
Go ahead... They'll get to you too...

1055
01:13:54,541 --> 01:13:59,375
You want me to get involved
with widowed spirits...

1056
01:13:59,416 --> 01:14:00,666
Okay.

1057
01:14:00,666 --> 01:14:02,250
Let's see who crosses my path.

1058
01:14:02,250 --> 01:14:06,083
Bankim's Rohini or Tagore's Binodini?

1059
01:16:27,791 --> 01:16:28,666
Hey!

1060
01:16:58,583 --> 01:16:59,583
How are you feeling?

1061
01:16:59,875 --> 01:17:01,958
Sona'da, I don't want any treasure.

1062
01:17:02,458 --> 01:17:05,333
You don't want it?
Then take this.

1063
01:17:06,708 --> 01:17:09,208
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

1064
01:17:09,208 --> 01:17:10,375
Please sit.

1065
01:17:10,541 --> 01:17:15,708
What's the matter, Abir?
We got a call last night.

1066
01:17:15,708 --> 01:17:18,541
I haven't seen you
since your uncle's funeral.

1067
01:17:20,375 --> 01:17:22,708
For the last couple of nights...

1068
01:17:22,708 --> 01:17:25,541
...people in disguises
have been breaking into the house.

1069
01:17:25,541 --> 01:17:27,333
I'm sure, they have
some evil intentions.

1070
01:17:27,333 --> 01:17:29,125
Last night, he even entered our room.

1071
01:17:29,125 --> 01:17:32,333
Abir scared him away.

1072
01:17:32,416 --> 01:17:34,791
I almost caught him but...

1073
01:17:34,875 --> 01:17:37,041
This is all I could get hold of.

1074
01:17:37,166 --> 01:17:40,791
You can well imagine the disguise
from the mask.

1075
01:17:40,791 --> 01:17:43,708
My goodness! Bravo, Abir!

1076
01:17:43,708 --> 01:17:44,666
Well done!

1077
01:17:44,750 --> 01:17:46,541
We've never had incidents
like this before, you know.

1078
01:17:46,541 --> 01:17:52,291
But recently, a local promoter
and a so-called social worker, Dasanan Daw...

1079
01:17:52,291 --> 01:17:54,125
He's the one creating such nuisance.

1080
01:17:54,125 --> 01:17:56,666
Basically, this is what promoters do
when they see a prospective property.

1081
01:17:56,666 --> 01:18:00,250
All he has to do is scare you away.
That's it.

1082
01:18:00,291 --> 01:18:02,375
- I don't think we've met...
- Let me introduce him...

1083
01:18:02,416 --> 01:18:06,916
He's my uncle but I call him brother.
Subarna Sen, history professor, Oxford.

1084
01:18:07,500 --> 01:18:10,125
You're Oxford's history professor,
Subarna Sen?

1085
01:18:10,125 --> 01:18:13,833
Really glad to meet you, sir.
My daughter's doing her PhD there.

1086
01:18:13,833 --> 01:18:16,000
She's a huge fan of yours.

1087
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:17,791
- What's her name?
- Semonti.

1088
01:18:17,791 --> 01:18:21,291
Right. Semonti Sarkar. Islamic History.
Bright student.

1089
01:18:21,291 --> 01:18:26,916
She's a litte shy. Brilliant handwriting
but still spells incorrectly.

1090
01:18:26,916 --> 01:18:30,958
- I'm Sanjay Sarkar, IC, Manikantapur.
- Nice meeting you, sir.

1091
01:18:30,958 --> 01:18:34,458
Please let me know
if there's any trouble.

1092
01:18:34,458 --> 01:18:35,583
Of course.

1093
01:18:35,750 --> 01:18:36,875
- I'll take your leave now.
- Okay.

1094
01:18:36,875 --> 01:18:39,833
I'm taking the mask with me.
We'll start an investigation.

1095
01:18:39,833 --> 01:18:41,458
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1096
01:18:47,666 --> 01:18:51,250
Semonti Sarkar. Islamic History.

1097
01:18:51,541 --> 01:18:56,416
Bright student. Beautiful handwriting.
But makes spelling mistakes.

1098
01:18:56,416 --> 01:18:57,458
Great!

1099
01:18:57,833 --> 01:19:01,625
My lord, for the last seven years,
all the students who came for research...

1100
01:19:01,625 --> 01:19:04,958
All their plus points and minus points
are saved up here.

1101
01:19:04,958 --> 01:19:07,416
You seem to have an expandable memory.

1102
01:19:07,500 --> 01:19:09,875
Do you remember everyone
or just someone special...

1103
01:19:09,875 --> 01:19:11,875
- I want you to meet a widowed ghost...
- What? Why?

1104
01:19:11,875 --> 01:19:14,041
We've to go to the inner chambers
of the house. Come on...

1105
01:19:14,041 --> 01:19:14,958
No...

1106
01:19:14,958 --> 01:19:18,125
I was walking right here
last night, you know...

1107
01:19:18,125 --> 01:19:19,791
Admiring the beautiful structures.

1108
01:19:19,791 --> 01:19:21,833
Suddenly, I noticed a strange woman
staring out of the window at me.

1109
01:19:21,833 --> 01:19:23,625
Really? You saw a ghost?

1110
01:19:23,625 --> 01:19:25,500
Don't know if I was hallucinating.

1111
01:19:25,500 --> 01:19:28,708
And that's exactly when you screamed
and I ran to you.

1112
01:19:28,833 --> 01:19:33,208
I bumped into your "ghost" on the way
and he gifted me his mask.

1113
01:19:33,250 --> 01:19:34,333
This way...

1114
01:19:38,916 --> 01:19:40,708
- What is that?
- What?

1115
01:19:41,208 --> 01:19:44,083
- Amazing! What a beautiful statue!
- Statue?

1116
01:19:44,125 --> 01:19:46,083
Yes... There it is.

1117
01:19:47,333 --> 01:19:50,166
I'm sure this used to be
the inner quarters then.

1118
01:19:50,208 --> 01:19:52,875
I've never noticed it before.

1119
01:19:57,958 --> 01:19:59,250
Yeah, tell me.

1120
01:19:59,500 --> 01:20:01,208
Oh, Akhilesh Uncle...

1121
01:20:01,208 --> 01:20:02,083
It's Akhilesh Uncle.

1122
01:20:03,416 --> 01:20:07,500
Why such formality?

1123
01:20:08,541 --> 01:20:11,250
We can come on our own...
No need to send Jhinuk.

1124
01:20:11,250 --> 01:20:13,500
See you, uncle.

1125
01:20:14,541 --> 01:20:15,958
Lunch.

1126
01:20:16,208 --> 01:20:18,708
You said you're going to start walking.
When is that?

1127
01:20:18,708 --> 01:20:21,333
It's "after dinner walk a mile".

1128
01:20:21,333 --> 01:20:24,541
- Oh...You'll walk at night?
- Yeah...

1129
01:20:24,541 --> 01:20:27,291
I'm not scared of the night anymore.
Grandmom's there.

1130
01:20:27,291 --> 01:20:29,625
- Thanks Granny!
- Granny?

1131
01:20:30,416 --> 01:20:33,333
"Where the mind is without fear
and the head is held high."

1132
01:20:33,333 --> 01:20:37,291
For lunch today,
we'll have mutton and fish fry.

1133
01:20:38,958 --> 01:20:44,333
Has Lord Shiva ever been invited to lunch
by Goddess Durga's father?

1134
01:20:44,333 --> 01:20:49,541
Or that Lord Krishna is being cooked for
and fed by Radha's father?

1135
01:20:49,541 --> 01:20:51,250
I can see that someone else
is inspiring your clothes.

1136
01:20:51,250 --> 01:20:53,166
Please don't eat according
to your standards there.

1137
01:20:53,166 --> 01:20:55,333
No way. Are you crazy?

1138
01:20:55,416 --> 01:20:57,833
When I'll be offered lunch today...

1139
01:20:57,833 --> 01:20:59,208
Guess what I'll say?

1140
01:20:59,208 --> 01:21:02,375
No, no... How can a person eat so much
in the afternoon?

1141
01:21:03,208 --> 01:21:04,375
What do you mean?

1142
01:21:04,666 --> 01:21:07,250
You are not going to stop them before?

1143
01:21:08,250 --> 01:21:12,375
I have to eat a minimum amount
to appreciate the food.

1144
01:21:12,375 --> 01:21:13,916
Not at all.

1145
01:21:14,375 --> 01:21:16,791
You're going to eat two or three fried bread...

1146
01:21:17,166 --> 01:21:18,375
One serving of rice...

1147
01:21:18,375 --> 01:21:21,416
One piece of fish
and two pieces of mutton. Done.

1148
01:21:23,458 --> 01:21:25,875
Mahadeb, put some rice on.

1149
01:21:25,875 --> 01:21:27,916
Rationing food at an invitation...

1150
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:31,458
Stop telling me what to do.
Have you been able to solve it?

1151
01:21:31,458 --> 01:21:33,583
That's what I'm trying to do.
Come here.

1152
01:21:34,166 --> 01:21:36,125
There's a pattern here.

1153
01:21:36,125 --> 01:21:38,333
19, 20, 21 are consecutive numbers...

1154
01:21:38,416 --> 01:21:41,625
There's a 15 in this square and...

1155
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:46,041
Where's the fun in numbers?

1156
01:21:46,166 --> 01:21:47,541
Fun is in the Bengali language.

1157
01:21:47,666 --> 01:21:52,041
They say, love from maternal home
and the love from in-laws home is unparalleled.

1158
01:21:52,041 --> 01:21:53,333
You're right.

1159
01:21:53,333 --> 01:21:55,083
What I was thinking is...

1160
01:21:55,333 --> 01:21:58,750
We'll give Akhilesh Uncle one gold coin
if we find the treasure.

1161
01:21:58,750 --> 01:21:59,833
Whom?

1162
01:21:59,833 --> 01:22:02,125
Akhilesh Uncle... For treating us today.

1163
01:22:02,708 --> 01:22:06,958
But you actually want to impress Jhinuk.

1164
01:22:07,541 --> 01:22:11,750
Just keep in mind,
she's Manikantapur's Jhinuk.

1165
01:22:11,958 --> 01:22:15,333
Don't think she'll be impressed with gold.

1166
01:22:15,791 --> 01:22:16,750
Correct.

1167
01:22:17,041 --> 01:22:18,333
Objection sustained.

1168
01:22:20,416 --> 01:22:25,041
Hey, goodlooking...
You're looking good...

1169
01:22:25,041 --> 01:22:28,208
- Sona'da!
- There she is...

1170
01:22:35,083 --> 01:22:36,208
Hey...

1171
01:22:36,625 --> 01:22:41,166
The ancient texts talk about the beautification
of Radha and not of Lord Krishna.

1172
01:22:44,458 --> 01:22:45,291
Let's go.

1173
01:22:45,291 --> 01:22:49,375
Hey, goodlooking...
You're looking good...

1174
01:22:56,625 --> 01:22:58,250
- Let's go.
- Yes, please.

1175
01:23:09,125 --> 01:23:12,000
Hey, we're walking home.

1176
01:23:12,166 --> 01:23:15,291
I'll show you a very special part
of this house.

1177
01:23:15,291 --> 01:23:19,208
- You really love this house, don't you, Jhinuk?
- A lot!

1178
01:23:19,291 --> 01:23:24,458
If this was my house, I would have
maintained it as a heritage property.

1179
01:23:24,458 --> 01:23:26,000
Follow me.

1180
01:23:28,416 --> 01:23:29,500
Did you hear her?

1181
01:23:29,500 --> 01:23:31,916
She called it "her" house.

1182
01:23:32,208 --> 01:23:33,666
Let's go.

1183
01:23:38,208 --> 01:23:42,500
It's in a horrible state...
But we can fix it.

1184
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,375
This side is infested with snakes.

1185
01:23:46,833 --> 01:23:48,416
Then it's best to be avoided.

1186
01:23:48,416 --> 01:23:51,166
Adventure... That too in this mythical mansion.

1187
01:23:51,166 --> 01:23:53,208
Would you ever find this in Kolkata?

1188
01:23:53,250 --> 01:23:55,625
Sona'da, you see this well...

1189
01:23:55,625 --> 01:24:00,416
There was a tunnel through this
all the way to the Rangini river.

1190
01:24:00,583 --> 01:24:03,916
Sona'da, a tunnel...

1191
01:24:04,166 --> 01:24:07,541
Hidden treasure?
Come on.

1192
01:24:11,416 --> 01:24:12,625
Beautiful!

1193
01:24:12,791 --> 01:24:14,708
This is the Neel Sayar, the blue lake.

1194
01:24:14,875 --> 01:24:16,833
Because of the blue sky
reflecting in it?

1195
01:24:16,833 --> 01:24:20,750
Wow! Your vocabulary has increased overnight.

1196
01:24:20,750 --> 01:24:25,875
You see, all one needs is inspiration.

1197
01:24:25,958 --> 01:24:29,958
Not really... Blue coloured lotus
would bloom here...

1198
01:24:29,958 --> 01:24:31,666
That's why Neel Sayar.

1199
01:24:31,750 --> 01:24:34,625
There's a Durga temple across the jungle.

1200
01:24:34,666 --> 01:24:36,166
It's ancient, you know.

1201
01:24:36,208 --> 01:24:41,250
Really? Poor Hanuman...
If only he knew about it.

1202
01:24:41,291 --> 01:24:47,333
Then he wouldn't have to go to Manas Sarovar
for the blue lotus for Lord Rama.

1203
01:24:49,333 --> 01:24:53,458
I haven't seen right outside my own door...

1204
01:24:53,541 --> 01:24:54,916
Hey!

1205
01:24:57,333 --> 01:24:58,625
Sona'da...

1206
01:24:59,833 --> 01:25:01,041
Get it.

1207
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,041
- Are you okay?
- Yes... Yes...

1208
01:25:13,291 --> 01:25:14,958
Do you know it's illegal to catch snakes?

1209
01:25:14,958 --> 01:25:19,000
What are you saying, sir?
It's our livelihood.

1210
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:20,916
Thank god, he caught it.

1211
01:25:20,916 --> 01:25:23,041
- How poisionous is it?
- It's very poisonous.

1212
01:25:23,041 --> 01:25:25,583
One bite is enough to kill.

1213
01:25:25,916 --> 01:25:28,625
Sona'da, let's go.
Daddy is waiting.

1214
01:25:28,625 --> 01:25:30,458
Yes, let's get going.

1215
01:25:31,666 --> 01:25:32,791
Let's go.

1216
01:25:34,541 --> 01:25:38,208
- The food must be getting cold...
- Sona'da, come quickly.

1217
01:25:38,583 --> 01:25:42,291
Great! Everyone is here.

1218
01:25:42,833 --> 01:25:44,500
What's the matter?

1219
01:25:44,500 --> 01:25:48,916
Is disturbing people,
part of your social work?

1220
01:25:48,916 --> 01:25:50,250
Woah!

1221
01:25:50,958 --> 01:25:53,125
You are guests here.

1222
01:25:53,125 --> 01:25:54,791
So, we're keeping an eye on you.

1223
01:25:54,791 --> 01:25:56,166
Go...

1224
01:25:57,666 --> 01:26:01,083
You've been sucking the Singho Ray family dry
for generations.

1225
01:26:01,083 --> 01:26:03,208
Aren't you satisfied yet?

1226
01:26:03,208 --> 01:26:07,958
Historically, the managers
were far more evil than the landlords!

1227
01:26:08,333 --> 01:26:10,375
Calm down.

1228
01:26:11,208 --> 01:26:13,000
Young blood!

1229
01:26:13,416 --> 01:26:17,041
Always looking for action.
Bang! Bang!

1230
01:26:17,625 --> 01:26:21,083
"Bang! Bang!" doesn't work
all the time, Subarna.

1231
01:26:22,958 --> 01:26:26,500
There are better techniques.

1232
01:26:27,541 --> 01:26:31,916
I heard you've become friends
with the police chief.

1233
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,250
Does that bother you?

1234
01:26:34,541 --> 01:26:37,500
Or does that scare you?

1235
01:26:44,375 --> 01:26:48,958
You've got me.
Fear... Fear...

1236
01:26:49,166 --> 01:26:54,541
- Hey, how many snakes did you catch?
- One cobra.

1237
01:26:57,541 --> 01:27:00,208
I want to see it...

1238
01:27:00,208 --> 01:27:04,458
So, does it bite?

1239
01:27:17,958 --> 01:27:23,291
Madam will hold her hand out.

1240
01:27:24,416 --> 01:27:30,791
And you'll put the snake
in front of her hand.

1241
01:27:31,250 --> 01:27:36,250
I'll count till 10.

1242
01:27:36,291 --> 01:27:40,416
You can remove the snake
once I'm done. Simple.

1243
01:27:49,250 --> 01:27:50,708
Bring it here.

1244
01:27:57,833 --> 01:28:00,750
- One?
- Moon!

1245
01:28:03,958 --> 01:28:07,208
- Two?
- Sides!

1246
01:28:09,583 --> 01:28:12,791
- Three?
- Eyes!

1247
01:28:16,083 --> 01:28:19,083
- Four?
- Vedas!

1248
01:28:23,125 --> 01:28:26,875
- Five?
- Arrows!

1249
01:28:36,666 --> 01:28:39,708
Shall I continue?

1250
01:28:39,750 --> 01:28:44,416
I'm infinitely patient.
I can keep counting forever.

1251
01:28:44,791 --> 01:28:46,791
Why did you move the snake away?

1252
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,958
Let it go... Now!

1253
01:28:57,083 --> 01:29:02,000
If I ever see you around again...
Get lost!

1254
01:29:06,666 --> 01:29:11,583
Manikantapur is not the right place
for you, sir.

1255
01:29:12,375 --> 01:29:15,333
Why take such a big risk?

1256
01:29:16,166 --> 01:29:19,416
Your honour, what does you law book say?

1257
01:29:19,541 --> 01:29:24,666
Drowning in the river, bitten by a snake,
death by ghost scare...

1258
01:29:24,833 --> 01:29:27,416
Do such cases have any merit?

1259
01:29:29,125 --> 01:29:31,875
Dasanan can never be framed.

1260
01:29:33,416 --> 01:29:36,916
I'm bringing my offer down
to 20 lakhs.

1261
01:29:37,458 --> 01:29:42,541
The more you stretch this,
the more the price will fall...

1262
01:29:42,541 --> 01:29:46,041
Enjoy the lunch at madam's place.

1263
01:29:46,333 --> 01:29:51,416
The fish's tail and head,
the chicken drumstick.

1264
01:29:53,041 --> 01:29:55,541
Convince your parents.

1265
01:30:01,458 --> 01:30:06,083
Otherwise, getting your signature
at gunpoint...

1266
01:30:06,708 --> 01:30:09,541
...is not my style.

1267
01:30:10,583 --> 01:30:11,875
Let's go.

1268
01:30:26,458 --> 01:30:30,250
Sorry, Jhinuk.
But you are a brave girl.

1269
01:30:30,250 --> 01:30:35,291
Treasure or no treasure,
we must avenge this.

1270
01:30:35,291 --> 01:30:37,916
I was really scared, you know.

1271
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:44,708
But this is all part of the adventure, right?

1272
01:30:44,708 --> 01:30:47,458
But please don't tell Daddy
about all this.

1273
01:30:47,458 --> 01:30:50,000
He'll be worried.

1274
01:30:50,875 --> 01:30:54,458
Come on... Let's go.

1275
01:30:59,583 --> 01:31:01,750
Daddy!

1276
01:31:01,833 --> 01:31:03,083
Hi!

1277
01:31:03,416 --> 01:31:04,791
Welcome! Welcome!

1278
01:31:04,791 --> 01:31:06,125
What took you so long?

1279
01:31:06,125 --> 01:31:09,625
We took a quick detour to Neel Sayar.
This way, please.

1280
01:31:09,666 --> 01:31:11,458
We have to visit the Durga temple too.

1281
01:31:11,458 --> 01:31:13,791
You must see it.

1282
01:31:13,791 --> 01:31:16,166
I was just going to call.

1283
01:31:16,250 --> 01:31:18,041
We were lost in the beauty of the place.

1284
01:31:18,041 --> 01:31:20,833
And the local people are so cordial.
They were not letting us go.

1285
01:31:20,833 --> 01:31:24,291
Except for Dasanan, of course.

1286
01:31:24,291 --> 01:31:26,625
Come along.
Food is served.

1287
01:31:26,958 --> 01:31:28,375
Come, Abir.

1288
01:31:28,916 --> 01:31:30,958
Come, Subarna.

1289
01:31:31,875 --> 01:31:33,333
Please take a seat.

1290
01:31:36,958 --> 01:31:38,750
How has it been?

1291
01:31:38,750 --> 01:31:41,416
Did you find any new clues, Subarna?

1292
01:31:41,458 --> 01:31:43,375
Yes. This time it's numbers.

1293
01:31:43,416 --> 01:31:44,625
- Numbers?
- Yes.

1294
01:31:44,750 --> 01:31:46,500
There are a few numbers
in a particular sequence.

1295
01:31:46,500 --> 01:31:48,125
May I see it, please?

1296
01:31:48,375 --> 01:31:50,375
Is this like a bell cipher?

1297
01:31:50,375 --> 01:31:52,041
Exactly, it's a bell cipher.

1298
01:31:52,250 --> 01:31:55,333
- Yes, bell cipher.
- Amazing.

1299
01:31:55,958 --> 01:31:57,708
This is like a labyrinth.

1300
01:31:57,708 --> 01:32:00,666
Is it pointing to any direction?

1301
01:32:00,708 --> 01:32:02,458
Latitude? Longitude?

1302
01:32:02,541 --> 01:32:04,041
I don't think so.

1303
01:32:04,041 --> 01:32:07,041
In the original puzzle, the numbers were
cut out from a calendar.

1304
01:32:07,041 --> 01:32:09,458
So the highest number
can't go above 31.

1305
01:32:09,458 --> 01:32:09,916
Correct.

1306
01:32:09,916 --> 01:32:11,458
- Let's see what's the highest number here.
- Here you go.

1307
01:32:11,625 --> 01:32:14,083
Highest is... there's 25...

1308
01:32:14,083 --> 01:32:15,791
Solve the puzzle later.

1309
01:32:15,833 --> 01:32:17,791
First, eat these hot prawn fritters.

1310
01:32:17,791 --> 01:32:19,916
- Daddy?
- Yes, I want some.

1311
01:32:20,583 --> 01:32:21,708
- Let them try some.
- Sona'da?

1312
01:32:21,708 --> 01:32:23,291
Not me. Please give him.

1313
01:32:23,291 --> 01:32:23,875
Thank you.

1314
01:32:26,208 --> 01:32:29,500
You don't need feedback from me.
Just look at his face.

1315
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:34,125
Akhilesh Uncle, while coming here I mentioned
two of Bengal's favourite dishes.

1316
01:32:34,125 --> 01:32:36,375
- Like what?
- KIS and KPJ.

1317
01:32:36,375 --> 01:32:38,458
One is "Kolaghat's Ilish Shorshe"
that's Kolaghat's Mustard Hilsa.

1318
01:32:38,458 --> 01:32:40,041
Another one is "Kochi Pathar Jhol"
that's mutton curry.

1319
01:32:41,583 --> 01:32:43,833
I think I'll have to add CAB to the list.

1320
01:32:43,833 --> 01:32:46,666
CAB? The Cricket Association of Bengal.

1321
01:32:46,666 --> 01:32:47,500
No, no...

1322
01:32:47,583 --> 01:32:50,583
"Chingrimachher Aaschorjyo Bora"
meaning magical prawn fritters.

1323
01:32:51,291 --> 01:32:54,625
Then please be aware,
BCCI is coming soon.

1324
01:32:54,666 --> 01:32:56,041
What's BCCI?

1325
01:32:56,625 --> 01:33:00,916
"Bagda Chingri'r Chomotkar Item"
which is good old prawn cream curry.

1326
01:33:01,083 --> 01:33:02,250
Come...

1327
01:33:02,958 --> 01:33:03,958
Please take a seat.

1328
01:33:03,958 --> 01:33:05,958
- Hope you've eaten well?
- Yes, of course.

1329
01:33:06,375 --> 01:33:08,000
I can't think about food anymore.

1330
01:33:08,125 --> 01:33:10,416
Let me show you something.

1331
01:33:10,500 --> 01:33:12,166
"In search of Jhinuk".

1332
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:17,541
This has photos of Jhinuk
growing up.

1333
01:33:17,541 --> 01:33:19,000
Her mom started it.

1334
01:33:19,083 --> 01:33:19,500
Thank you.

1335
01:33:19,500 --> 01:33:20,333
Take a look.

1336
01:33:20,375 --> 01:33:21,541
Thank you.

1337
01:33:23,250 --> 01:33:24,375
Let me sit.

1338
01:33:26,833 --> 01:33:27,958
Let me see...

1339
01:33:29,666 --> 01:33:32,166
This chubby kid is you?

1340
01:33:32,291 --> 01:33:34,708
I'm fat?
You're fat too...

1341
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,666
Let me play something fun for you.

1342
01:33:38,750 --> 01:33:40,416
Jhinuk's recordings.

1343
01:33:40,416 --> 01:33:42,958
When Jhinuk started learning
the alphabets...

1344
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:47,583
...her mom insisted
we get a tape recorder.

1345
01:33:47,916 --> 01:33:51,541
She wanted to record Jhinuk
saying, "A, B, C, D"...

1346
01:33:51,583 --> 01:33:52,958
I'll play the casette.

1347
01:33:52,958 --> 01:33:57,625
Now, our lovely Titli is going to recite
the alphabets for us.

1348
01:33:57,625 --> 01:33:58,458
Titli?

1349
01:33:59,333 --> 01:34:03,583
Her mother would call her Titli.

1350
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:05,708
Titli, darling...

1351
01:34:05,875 --> 01:34:07,000
One...

1352
01:34:07,083 --> 01:34:08,250
Two...

1353
01:34:08,375 --> 01:34:09,333
Three...

1354
01:34:09,625 --> 01:34:10,500
Four...

1355
01:34:10,500 --> 01:34:13,833
A, b, c, d, e, f, g...

1356
01:34:13,916 --> 01:34:17,166
...h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p...

1357
01:34:17,166 --> 01:34:20,458
...l, m , n, o, p, q, r, s, t...

1358
01:34:20,458 --> 01:34:21,375
...u, v, w...

1359
01:34:21,375 --> 01:34:24,125
Damn! I couldn't figure it out earlier.

1360
01:34:24,125 --> 01:34:25,708
- Can I get a pen, Jhinuk?
- Yes...

1361
01:34:26,083 --> 01:34:27,291
What happened, Subarna?

1362
01:34:27,375 --> 01:34:32,208
- This is not a bell cipher.
- Here's the pen.

1363
01:34:32,208 --> 01:34:36,000
I think these numbers indicate alphabets.

1364
01:34:36,166 --> 01:34:39,000
These numbers are actually alphabets?

1365
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,041
That's why the numbers don't go
beyond 26.

1366
01:34:41,041 --> 01:34:41,458
Really?

1367
01:34:41,458 --> 01:34:43,625
If we replace the numbers
with alphabets...

1368
01:34:43,625 --> 01:34:45,916
I think we'll be able to solve the puzzle.

1369
01:34:46,458 --> 01:34:47,458
Here it is.

1370
01:34:47,583 --> 01:34:48,625
"Study room".

1371
01:34:48,791 --> 01:34:50,750
"Book shelf".
"Lowest rack".

1372
01:34:50,791 --> 01:34:52,958
"Nihar Roy".
"Inside map".

1373
01:34:54,875 --> 01:34:56,583
Bravo, Hari! Bravo!

1374
01:34:56,750 --> 01:34:58,166
Brilliant, Subarna!

1375
01:34:58,166 --> 01:35:00,041
- We must leave now.
- Okay.

1376
01:35:00,041 --> 01:35:01,000
- Let's go, Abir.
- I'm ready.

1377
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:02,333
- Bye, Akhilesh Uncle.
- Bye...

1378
01:35:02,333 --> 01:35:05,333
- Jhinuk, see you later...Thank you...
- All the best. Be careful.

1379
01:35:05,333 --> 01:35:06,791
- Abir...
- All the best.

1380
01:35:10,333 --> 01:35:12,833
- Abir, let me know how it goes.
- Of course...

1381
01:35:32,291 --> 01:35:33,500
Study room...

1382
01:35:35,916 --> 01:35:37,291
Book shelf...

1383
01:35:37,666 --> 01:35:40,500
Lowest rack...
Nihar Ranjan Roy...

1384
01:35:40,541 --> 01:35:42,000
"History of Bengalis"...

1385
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:43,166
Inside map...

1386
01:35:43,208 --> 01:35:44,291
- It's here...
- It's here!

1387
01:35:45,791 --> 01:35:48,250
"Abir, you didn't see the hint
right in front of your eyes.

1388
01:35:48,291 --> 01:35:50,583
"A-1 puzzle means A=1...

1389
01:35:50,666 --> 01:35:52,333
"If you've come this far means you've won.

1390
01:35:52,333 --> 01:35:54,958
"Be safe and take good care
of Shah Shuja's hidden treasure.

1391
01:35:55,041 --> 01:35:57,500
"This is the last riddle.
The last hurdle to the hidden treasure."

1392
01:35:57,500 --> 01:35:58,833
Let me see.

1393
01:35:59,291 --> 01:36:01,833
"Ten comes together to make up the three
Nine stands in the middle

1394
01:36:01,833 --> 01:36:04,166
"Three folds and a tune
The cleft dresses a little

1395
01:36:06,583 --> 01:36:09,583
"Touch the feet... Behold
And Voila!"

1396
01:36:09,583 --> 01:36:12,000
Jhinuk is calling.
Let me give her the news.

1397
01:36:12,291 --> 01:36:13,458
Yeah, Jhinuk.

1398
01:36:14,250 --> 01:36:15,875
No trouble on the way back.

1399
01:36:15,875 --> 01:36:18,708
We have a new riddle. Yeah...

1400
01:36:18,708 --> 01:36:21,166
Last hurdle... Let's meet and discuss.

1401
01:36:21,208 --> 01:36:22,291
Neel Sayar?

1402
01:36:23,875 --> 01:36:25,916
That's good with us. What time?

1403
01:36:25,916 --> 01:36:28,458
Three o'clock. Okay. Bye.

1404
01:36:30,708 --> 01:36:34,708
First the swing
and then the Durga temple.

1405
01:36:34,708 --> 01:36:37,000
This is my favourite place.

1406
01:36:37,125 --> 01:36:39,458
I used to come here a lot with my mom
when I was little.

1407
01:36:39,458 --> 01:36:41,166
I still do.

1408
01:36:47,500 --> 01:36:49,000
Magic moment.

1409
01:36:50,583 --> 01:36:53,000
Tell her how you feel.

1410
01:37:11,250 --> 01:37:14,000
"Ten comes together to make up the three
Nine stands in the middle

1411
01:37:14,041 --> 01:37:16,291
"Three folds and a tune"...

1412
01:37:16,666 --> 01:37:20,791
10 plus 3 is 13.
Nope.

1413
01:37:21,166 --> 01:37:25,625
10 directions or the goddess
with 10 hands, Durga.

1414
01:37:25,625 --> 01:37:28,333
But what is nine doing in the middle?

1415
01:37:29,125 --> 01:37:31,791
"Three folds and a tune"...
Three again...

1416
01:37:32,750 --> 01:37:37,708
It can mean a lot of things...

1417
01:37:39,083 --> 01:37:41,750
"The cleft dresses a little..."

1418
01:37:41,750 --> 01:37:44,458
Is he referring to Rangini's bank?

1419
01:37:45,166 --> 01:37:49,916
"Put six and seven together"...
That makes 13 again.

1420
01:38:43,916 --> 01:38:45,458
Sona'da?

1421
01:39:02,916 --> 01:39:05,291
Come with us!

1422
01:39:26,041 --> 01:39:31,708
Subarna, did you touch the mother's feet?

1423
01:39:31,708 --> 01:39:34,625
Did you solve the new riddle?

1424
01:39:34,666 --> 01:39:38,583
Let me give it a try too.

1425
01:39:40,083 --> 01:39:42,916
Tell me what it means.
Now!

1426
01:39:43,166 --> 01:39:44,458
I still don't know what it means.

1427
01:39:44,500 --> 01:39:47,291
You know everything! Everything!

1428
01:39:57,541 --> 01:40:00,625
If I don't get the hidden treasure,
I'll drown them in Rangini.

1429
01:40:00,625 --> 01:40:02,916
They'll be on a raft.

1430
01:40:04,041 --> 01:40:06,541
Sona'da, don't tell them anything.
Please, don't tell them.

1431
01:40:07,708 --> 01:40:11,166
I'll tell you. I just need more time.

1432
01:40:12,250 --> 01:40:13,791
Is there a Durga temple nearby?

1433
01:40:13,791 --> 01:40:16,416
Of course, there is.
In the jungle across Neel Sayar.

1434
01:40:17,083 --> 01:40:18,458
That's where we'll have to go.

1435
01:40:18,458 --> 01:40:20,208
"Ten comes together
to make up the three" means...

1436
01:40:22,750 --> 01:40:26,875
- The third side is...
- North, West, East... East! East!

1437
01:40:26,875 --> 01:40:30,250
We have to enter the temple
from the East.

1438
01:40:30,250 --> 01:40:32,416
Then we have to go to
the decorated bank where...

1439
01:40:32,458 --> 01:40:34,750
Where six and seven will come together...

1440
01:40:34,750 --> 01:40:39,958
We'll have to purify ourselves...

1441
01:40:39,958 --> 01:40:44,375
Then we have to touch the idol
with a pure heart...

1442
01:40:44,375 --> 01:40:46,541
Then, we have to look around.

1443
01:40:46,541 --> 01:40:50,625
Shah Shuja's treasure is hidden
somewhere in the walls of the temple.

1444
01:40:52,125 --> 01:40:54,333
Let's go, let's go.
Come on. Come on.

1445
01:40:54,458 --> 01:40:56,708
Bring the teacher alone!

1446
01:41:00,708 --> 01:41:03,708
- Hey, keep an eye on those two.
- Okay, boss.

1447
01:41:03,708 --> 01:41:07,416
Let's go to the Neel Sayar jungle.

1448
01:41:45,166 --> 01:41:47,166
I swear on Goddess Durga!

1449
01:41:47,916 --> 01:41:51,958
I'll gift golden crowns
to the Singhi Palace's Gopal.

1450
01:41:52,250 --> 01:41:55,583
This is my promise to the divine.
Get it, teacher?

1451
01:41:55,583 --> 01:41:59,000
There are nine idols
in the Singhi Palace temple walls.

1452
01:42:01,708 --> 01:42:02,958
Devotion!

1453
01:42:02,958 --> 01:42:05,041
I'll show the world
what devotion means.

1454
01:42:05,041 --> 01:42:07,375
Dasanan! Dasanan!

1455
01:42:07,375 --> 01:42:10,583
The riddle didn't specify which wall
hides the treasure.

1456
01:42:12,916 --> 01:42:14,125
I'll break it down.

1457
01:42:14,625 --> 01:42:16,666
I'll break down all the walls
if I have to.

1458
01:42:16,875 --> 01:42:18,958
Sona'da revealed all the clues?

1459
01:42:18,958 --> 01:42:21,000
What else could he have done?

1460
01:42:22,125 --> 01:42:25,000
Will they really break
the temple down?

1461
01:42:25,166 --> 01:42:27,208
This rascal can do anything...

1462
01:42:27,208 --> 01:42:29,291
He's behaving like a mad dog.

1463
01:42:30,375 --> 01:42:32,583
But can you escape
with the hidden treasure?

1464
01:42:32,583 --> 01:42:34,541
What if people get to know?

1465
01:42:35,500 --> 01:42:39,166
Don't push me, teacher.

1466
01:42:42,583 --> 01:42:43,541
That's good.

1467
01:42:43,750 --> 01:42:45,875
Maybe you pull the temple down.

1468
01:42:46,125 --> 01:42:49,250
But what about your public image?

1469
01:42:51,375 --> 01:42:52,958
The elections are coming up.

1470
01:42:54,083 --> 01:42:57,291
Do you think your opposition
will let go of this issue?

1471
01:42:58,041 --> 01:43:00,208
If you must break the temple...

1472
01:43:00,208 --> 01:43:02,833
Do it at night. Bit by bit.

1473
01:43:03,041 --> 01:43:07,125
People will think that an old temple
has fallen apart on it's own.

1474
01:43:09,375 --> 01:43:11,458
Okay, at night, then.

1475
01:43:11,458 --> 01:43:13,666
Pinka, Madna, stay here.

1476
01:43:14,416 --> 01:43:16,541
I'll be back at night.
Let's go.

1477
01:43:25,625 --> 01:43:27,041
- Jhinuk?
- Yeah.

1478
01:43:42,041 --> 01:43:43,416
Quietly...

1479
01:44:12,375 --> 01:44:13,875
Yes!

1480
01:44:13,875 --> 01:44:15,625
Rope!

1481
01:44:31,125 --> 01:44:33,250
- Let's take the cycle and go that way.
- Yes, cycle.

1482
01:44:34,958 --> 01:44:36,500
That way.

1483
01:44:37,041 --> 01:44:38,291
Which way?

1484
01:45:33,875 --> 01:45:36,125
Wait, wait.
Wait one moment.

1485
01:45:36,291 --> 01:45:38,041
Now which way?

1486
01:45:38,208 --> 01:45:40,791
- This way...
- Are you sure?

1487
01:45:44,625 --> 01:45:46,833
Stop here.

1488
01:45:51,791 --> 01:45:53,208
Follow me.

1489
01:46:30,708 --> 01:46:34,208
This is the Durga temple
the riddle talks about.

1490
01:46:34,208 --> 01:46:36,750
Shah Shuja's hidden treasure is here?

1491
01:46:39,958 --> 01:46:42,166
- Jhinuk... Sona'da.
- Yeah.

1492
01:46:44,666 --> 01:46:47,333
Come this way...

1493
01:46:55,541 --> 01:46:57,333
Sona'da...

1494
01:47:01,166 --> 01:47:04,750
Brother, please come here.

1495
01:47:07,458 --> 01:47:10,958
Can you give me some water?

1496
01:47:14,708 --> 01:47:15,375
I'll get you!

1497
01:47:42,750 --> 01:47:44,708
- Sona'da...
- Nilu, come here...

1498
01:47:46,625 --> 01:47:47,916
- Take it off...
- Look there...

1499
01:48:05,125 --> 01:48:07,250
No...

1500
01:48:07,958 --> 01:48:11,833
Please have mercy... I already have two bumps.
Please no more.

1501
01:48:16,625 --> 01:48:20,000
Nilu, I know you're a good boy.

1502
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:24,333
But you informed Dasanan
about us. Why?

1503
01:48:24,416 --> 01:48:26,541
Did he threaten you?

1504
01:48:27,416 --> 01:48:33,291
He said he'd kill my father
if I didn't give him information.

1505
01:48:33,291 --> 01:48:36,666
I never meant you any harm.

1506
01:48:36,708 --> 01:48:37,791
I know.

1507
01:48:37,875 --> 01:48:40,791
I'm going to give you
two important tasks.

1508
01:48:40,916 --> 01:48:42,875
First, tie up these scoundrels.

1509
01:48:42,875 --> 01:48:43,958
Then go to the police station.

1510
01:48:43,958 --> 01:48:47,083
Ask Inspector Sarkar to bring back up
to the Gopal temple right now.

1511
01:48:47,083 --> 01:48:48,833
Tell him I asked you.
Got it?

1512
01:48:48,916 --> 01:48:50,000
Go on.

1513
01:48:52,250 --> 01:48:53,666
Let me see.

1514
01:48:55,041 --> 01:48:58,500
Well done, Jhinuk.
Let's go.

1515
01:48:58,500 --> 01:48:59,583
Really?

1516
01:49:00,041 --> 01:49:01,541
Come quickly.

1517
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:08,500
Damn!

1518
01:49:19,583 --> 01:49:23,458
Boss! Boss! They have escaped!

1519
01:49:23,583 --> 01:49:26,833
- And Nera?
- He's tied up there.

1520
01:49:26,916 --> 01:49:28,625
What the hell!

1521
01:49:28,625 --> 01:49:30,500
What about Nera?

1522
01:49:30,500 --> 01:49:35,708
We'll take care of him later.
We have to go back to the Durga temple now.

1523
01:49:46,958 --> 01:49:49,666
- Now where?
- That way.

1524
01:49:55,500 --> 01:49:58,458
Hide... They're coming...

1525
01:50:02,291 --> 01:50:05,583
Run... Run... Run...
Come on, guys...

1526
01:50:06,541 --> 01:50:09,291
- This way?
- Yes.

1527
01:50:21,166 --> 01:50:24,541
Sona'da, we left the Durga temple behind.
Where is the treasure?

1528
01:50:24,541 --> 01:50:26,458
We have to solve the last riddle too.

1529
01:50:26,458 --> 01:50:27,833
- What do you mean?
- Yeah.

1530
01:50:27,833 --> 01:50:28,916
What are you talking about, Sona'da?

1531
01:50:28,916 --> 01:50:33,291
Both of you thought I gave away
all the clues to Dasanan.

1532
01:50:34,500 --> 01:50:36,333
Didn't I tell you?

1533
01:50:36,333 --> 01:50:38,208
Despacito.

1534
01:50:38,208 --> 01:50:40,000
I knew it already.

1535
01:50:40,458 --> 01:50:43,875
But how did you figure out
it was the Durga temple?

1536
01:50:43,875 --> 01:50:46,208
You had told us about
the Durga temple near Neel Sayar.

1537
01:50:46,208 --> 01:50:47,958
So, the credit goes to you.

1538
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:49,333
- Well done!
- Yes!

1539
01:50:49,333 --> 01:50:53,250
- Show me the short cut to the house.
- That way.

1540
01:50:58,458 --> 01:50:59,916
What a mess!

1541
01:51:02,541 --> 01:51:05,333
You got beaten up by a teacher?

1542
01:51:06,916 --> 01:51:09,291
You guys are going to put me
out of business.

1543
01:51:14,291 --> 01:51:16,333
Get in the car. Let's go.

1544
01:51:17,958 --> 01:51:20,750
Drive!

1545
01:51:27,291 --> 01:51:29,125
What are we doing here?

1546
01:51:29,500 --> 01:51:30,875
I'll tell you everything.

1547
01:51:30,875 --> 01:51:33,875
But before that we'll have to send
Ramkrishna away.

1548
01:51:33,875 --> 01:51:36,000
I don't want anyone else
in this temple right now.

1549
01:51:36,041 --> 01:51:38,000
Ramkrishna!

1550
01:51:38,500 --> 01:51:40,375
Ramkrishna!

1551
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:45,500
What are you doing here?

1552
01:51:45,500 --> 01:51:47,458
What's the matter?

1553
01:51:47,541 --> 01:51:49,916
Please ask Akhilesh Uncle to come here.
We're waiting.

1554
01:51:49,916 --> 01:51:53,416
- What happened?
- It's an emergency. Please hurry.

1555
01:51:53,416 --> 01:51:54,916
Okay.

1556
01:51:57,625 --> 01:51:58,791
Let's go in.

1557
01:52:01,625 --> 01:52:04,458
Guess who gave me the last hint
to solve the riddle?

1558
01:52:04,458 --> 01:52:05,666
Dasanan himself.

1559
01:52:05,666 --> 01:52:07,166
- Really.
- Yeah.

1560
01:52:07,166 --> 01:52:12,500
He told me about the 10 reicarnations of Vishnu
in the temple that he's going to crown.

1561
01:52:12,500 --> 01:52:15,083
- I'll show you.
- Let's go.

1562
01:52:36,583 --> 01:52:38,125
Look closely.

1563
01:52:38,125 --> 01:52:42,333
First is Matsya, the fish.
Second is Kurma, the tortoise.

1564
01:52:42,333 --> 01:52:46,166
Third is Varaha, the boar.
Fourth is Nrisingho, the half-man and half-lion.

1565
01:52:46,166 --> 01:52:48,291
Fifth is Vamana, the dwarf.

1566
01:52:48,500 --> 01:52:52,291
Sixth and seventh are Parashurama
and Rama respectively.

1567
01:52:52,416 --> 01:52:54,541
Eighth is Balaram.

1568
01:52:54,625 --> 01:52:56,750
Tenth is Kalki.

1569
01:52:56,750 --> 01:52:59,125
What about number nine?

1570
01:52:59,125 --> 01:53:01,916
This right here is the ninth, Lord Krishna.

1571
01:53:01,958 --> 01:53:04,208
Who is also called Gopal.

1572
01:53:04,208 --> 01:53:06,208
The three walls have the idols
of the 10 reincarnations of Lord Vishnu...

1573
01:53:06,208 --> 01:53:07,666
The ninth in the middle.

1574
01:53:07,666 --> 01:53:08,333
Right.

1575
01:53:08,333 --> 01:53:11,625
Next was, "Three folds and a tune"... right?

1576
01:53:12,541 --> 01:53:16,041
He is also called "Tribhanga Murari".
He stands in the three-bent pose.

1577
01:53:16,041 --> 01:53:20,541
Notice this...
One...two...three...

1578
01:53:20,750 --> 01:53:23,875
So, we got "Ten comes together
to make three"...

1579
01:53:25,541 --> 01:53:27,375
"Three folds and a tune" is also solved...

1580
01:53:27,375 --> 01:53:28,500
What came next?

1581
01:53:28,541 --> 01:53:30,166
"Three folds and a tune
The cleft dresses a little."

1582
01:53:35,958 --> 01:53:38,875
That's how I tricked Dasanan.

1583
01:53:39,458 --> 01:53:41,375
But then something struck me.

1584
01:53:41,375 --> 01:53:44,458
Lord Krishna's flute also has clefts or grooves.

1585
01:53:44,708 --> 01:53:46,000
Right here.

1586
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,333
Six grooves.

1587
01:53:48,333 --> 01:53:50,375
"The cleft dresses a little..."

1588
01:53:53,208 --> 01:53:54,833
The seven notes.

1589
01:53:54,833 --> 01:53:57,916
The seven notes are played
from these six holes.

1590
01:53:57,958 --> 01:53:59,000
What's next?

1591
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:00,958
"And hold on to your ma
Touch the feet..."

1592
01:54:00,958 --> 01:54:03,375
- Meaning what?
- That's easy.

1593
01:54:03,375 --> 01:54:04,958
Easy how?

1594
01:54:04,958 --> 01:54:06,625
"And hold on to your ma..."

1595
01:54:06,625 --> 01:54:09,125
But where is your mother?

1596
01:54:09,125 --> 01:54:11,833
Everything has to do with Lord Krishna.

1597
01:54:11,833 --> 01:54:14,250
That's true. She is not here.

1598
01:54:14,583 --> 01:54:16,708
"Ma" is here.

1599
01:54:16,750 --> 01:54:19,458
"Sa, re, ga, ma, pa".
The notes of Indian music.

1600
01:54:19,458 --> 01:54:20,791
That "Ma".

1601
01:54:21,250 --> 01:54:23,625
Therefore...

1602
01:54:26,625 --> 01:54:27,916
"Ma".

1603
01:54:28,500 --> 01:54:30,250
"Sa, re, ga, ma, pa"?

1604
01:54:30,375 --> 01:54:32,625
No, this time it's his feet.

1605
01:54:33,291 --> 01:54:37,708
"Touch the feet... Behold
And Voila!"

1606
01:54:45,166 --> 01:54:46,875
Let's go, Abir.

1607
01:54:50,541 --> 01:54:52,916
Be careful.

1608
01:55:44,708 --> 01:55:47,250
Mahadeb, where are they?

1609
01:55:47,250 --> 01:55:48,916
- Where are they?!
- I don't know.

1610
01:55:48,916 --> 01:55:51,541
They had gone out for lunch.
Haven't come back yet.

1611
01:55:51,541 --> 01:55:54,125
They'll all die!

1612
01:55:54,125 --> 01:55:56,333
You and your son
are not getting away with it.

1613
01:55:56,333 --> 01:55:58,375
I'll bury you alive, you idiot!

1614
01:55:58,375 --> 01:55:59,708
What's going on?

1615
01:56:00,041 --> 01:56:02,541
Good to see you, Mr. Majumdar.

1616
01:56:02,583 --> 01:56:06,291
- Where's your daughter? You've let her...
- Watch your mouth.

1617
01:56:06,333 --> 01:56:07,541
Where is she?

1618
01:56:07,625 --> 01:56:09,875
And where's your best friend's nephew?

1619
01:56:09,875 --> 01:56:11,458
Where are they?
Where are they?!

1620
01:56:11,458 --> 01:56:15,125
They are inside the temple.

1621
01:56:55,166 --> 01:56:56,541
Wow!

1622
01:56:57,500 --> 01:56:59,791
This is incredible!

1623
01:56:59,791 --> 01:57:02,208
I can't believe my own eyes.

1624
01:57:02,250 --> 01:57:06,583
Do you realise the historical significance
of Bengal's terracotta work?

1625
01:57:06,583 --> 01:57:10,416
No one created it for an audience.

1626
01:57:10,458 --> 01:57:12,208
But still the artistry...

1627
01:57:12,416 --> 01:57:15,833
Sona'da, what is written there?

1628
01:57:19,625 --> 01:57:23,333
"Shah Shuja comes by Rangini

1629
01:57:23,833 --> 01:57:26,916
"The Gopal temple was built in his honour.

1630
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:32,083
"Shah Shuja transcended all traditional norms.

1631
01:57:32,416 --> 01:57:35,666
"He gave Gopal a precious gift

1632
01:57:36,041 --> 01:57:39,833
"A golden crown to adorn Gopal's head.

1633
01:57:40,666 --> 01:57:44,333
"He presented a diamond necklace to Gopal.

1634
01:57:44,416 --> 01:57:47,666
"And Krishna devotee, Nrishingho
also got blessed.

1635
01:57:47,666 --> 01:57:54,416
"Gopal keeps this treasure hidden.

1636
01:57:54,416 --> 01:57:58,666
"And since that day, the village
was named Manikantapur.

1637
01:57:58,666 --> 01:58:00,250
So cool!

1638
01:58:00,791 --> 01:58:04,291
So, this is the story of renaming
Ronghati as Manikantapur.

1639
01:58:04,291 --> 01:58:09,250
- What a secular story!
- Exactly... Secular...

1640
01:58:10,750 --> 01:58:17,875
After losing the Battle of Khajwa to his brother,
Shuja fled to Arakan.

1641
01:58:20,958 --> 01:58:25,041
I can see the history flash
before my eyes.

1642
01:58:25,125 --> 01:58:26,791
Brilliant!

1643
01:58:27,250 --> 01:58:29,250
But where is the hidden treasure?

1644
01:58:29,333 --> 01:58:32,250
- Do we have to break these walls...
- Are you crazy?

1645
01:58:32,333 --> 01:58:36,083
This terracotta artwork
is no less than any treasure.

1646
01:58:36,541 --> 01:58:38,875
I have a feeling...

1647
01:58:38,875 --> 01:58:41,500
Your uncle left so many clues...

1648
01:58:41,500 --> 01:58:43,250
But he didn't leave the exact location
of the treasure.

1649
01:58:43,250 --> 01:58:50,041
Remember the network
that follows everywhere.

1650
01:58:51,458 --> 01:58:57,250
I, Dasanan Daw, is that network.

1651
01:59:01,083 --> 01:59:02,875
Where is the treasure?

1652
01:59:03,041 --> 01:59:05,333
We're looking for it.
You can look for it too, if you want.

1653
01:59:05,333 --> 01:59:07,666
- For the last time...
- I know...

1654
01:59:08,250 --> 01:59:10,958
You have no "patient".

1655
01:59:11,791 --> 01:59:17,166
Dasanan, it's patience. Not patient.

1656
01:59:20,125 --> 01:59:21,833
Banka!

1657
01:59:25,291 --> 01:59:26,916
Daddy!

1658
01:59:28,333 --> 01:59:30,541
Let me go...

1659
01:59:31,916 --> 01:59:37,250
Manikantipur's hospital has so many patients
because my patience is so low.

1660
01:59:37,625 --> 01:59:39,041
Is it clear?

1661
01:59:40,250 --> 01:59:42,208
Spit it out... Spit it out.

1662
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:45,583
Otherwise, there'll be sunset there...

1663
01:59:47,291 --> 01:59:50,666
And everyone will be upset here.

1664
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:04,416
Nrishinghosnarayan,
our great ancestor.

1665
02:00:04,416 --> 02:00:08,541
The jewel that Lord Vishnu wears, Syamantaka.

1666
02:00:08,541 --> 02:00:14,375
The dying rays of the Sun fall
on the jewel.

1667
02:00:14,583 --> 02:00:18,458
Hidden from everyone,
the jewel lights up once everyday.

1668
02:00:18,708 --> 02:00:20,333
Wonderful!

1669
02:00:21,166 --> 02:00:25,750
Your uncle's epitaph...
He truly was a genius.

1670
02:00:27,625 --> 02:00:32,625
"Paint me before you depart."

1671
02:00:32,625 --> 02:00:37,166
"Paint me in your youthful smile."

1672
02:00:37,166 --> 02:00:41,875
"The colour should touch my heart
It should colour my deeds."

1673
02:00:42,833 --> 02:00:47,625
"Let it paint the blaze of the lamp
Let it keep me up at night."

1674
02:00:47,625 --> 02:00:51,000
"A star shines bright in the heart
of the dark night."

1675
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:55,208
"And a dark cave wakes up."

1676
02:00:56,458 --> 02:00:58,125
Daddy!

1677
02:00:58,208 --> 02:01:01,458
Clue to the hidden treasure
is a Tagore song?

1678
02:01:01,458 --> 02:01:02,458
My god!

1679
02:01:02,458 --> 02:01:05,333
Abir, give me your hand.

1680
02:01:08,041 --> 02:01:10,625
Not your whole hand... The ring...

1681
02:02:26,041 --> 02:02:27,291
Now, we're even.

1682
02:02:27,291 --> 02:02:30,250
Your time is over, Dasanan.

1683
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:39,250
Abir Lal Roy, finally the hidden treasure
is in our hands.

1684
02:02:50,041 --> 02:02:51,583
Open it.

1685
02:03:01,541 --> 02:03:05,041
Abir, royal treasure!

1686
02:03:35,750 --> 02:03:36,458
He's here.

1687
02:03:36,458 --> 02:03:39,291
Thank you, Mr. Sarkar.

1688
02:03:39,791 --> 02:03:43,375
Buried deep inside this Gopal temple
is Shah Shuja's priceless wealth.

1689
02:03:43,458 --> 02:03:48,291
The Singho Ray family has been protecting it
for the last 350 years.

1690
02:03:48,291 --> 02:03:51,625
- You've excavated the unthinkable, sir?
- It wasn't me.

1691
02:03:51,625 --> 02:03:53,125
It's the doing of Hari Narayan Singho Ray.

1692
02:03:53,125 --> 02:03:55,000
He found this treasure first.

1693
02:03:55,000 --> 02:04:02,458
But it's quite unbelievable that
Shah Shuja's treasure is hidden in Manikantapur.

1694
02:04:02,458 --> 02:04:05,958
Before I forget, there's
someone else inside, Dasanan.

1695
02:04:05,958 --> 02:04:08,000
He's a little injured.
Please see if you can help him.

1696
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:10,208
- Don't worry. I'll take care of it.
- Thank you.

1697
02:04:10,208 --> 02:04:11,958
Follow me.

1698
02:04:15,291 --> 02:04:19,750
Hari's soul is finally at peace.

1699
02:04:20,541 --> 02:04:22,000
Abir...

1700
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:24,666
What's your plan with the treasure?

1701
02:04:24,666 --> 02:04:26,625
It must be worth a few hundred crores.

1702
02:04:26,625 --> 02:04:29,166
But now, it's time for reality.

1703
02:04:29,333 --> 02:04:32,166
What does the constitution
say about this, Mr. Lawyer?

1704
02:04:33,250 --> 02:04:38,208
According to the constitution, we must
deposit the treasure to the museum.

1705
02:04:38,208 --> 02:04:41,000
But you'll get a percentage of it.
That won't be very little either.

1706
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:46,541
And even beyond the constitution
is the Manu's law.

1707
02:04:46,541 --> 02:04:49,250
That's today's civil law for you.

1708
02:04:49,250 --> 02:04:55,125
According to that the most valuable asset
of this house will soon be...

1709
02:04:55,500 --> 02:04:56,708
Stop smiling.

1710
02:04:56,708 --> 02:04:59,500
Didn't you put a gold coin
in your pocket then?

1711
02:04:59,791 --> 02:05:02,958
This is the moment.
Go ahead, nephew.

1712
02:05:10,541 --> 02:05:13,166
Jhinuk, my real treasure.

1713
02:05:14,750 --> 02:05:17,625
- I will agree on one condition.
- Condition?

1714
02:05:17,666 --> 02:05:19,583
You have to fix the whole house.

1715
02:05:20,166 --> 02:05:21,583
Of course!

1716
02:05:21,583 --> 02:05:23,958
Now, even we have so many memories
with this house.

1717
02:05:25,250 --> 02:05:28,166
Jyotsna, let the repairman know.

1718
02:05:28,166 --> 02:05:30,041
Ask them to come tomorrow.

1719
02:05:30,041 --> 02:05:31,916
That'll be so nice.

1720
02:05:31,916 --> 02:05:33,708
We're here!

1721
02:05:33,708 --> 02:05:42,375
And I figure, Jhinuk has agreed
to be our daughter-in-law.

1722
02:05:45,083 --> 02:05:46,500
Are you feeling shy?

1723
02:05:46,500 --> 02:05:49,375
- Akhilesh, let's fix a wedding date.
- Okay...

1724
02:05:49,375 --> 02:05:52,375
Our priest is also here...

1725
02:05:52,375 --> 02:05:55,208
The sooner, the better.
