Rector!

32
00:02:52,972 --> 00:02:57,909
Now that you're going home,
just try to stay out of mischief!

33
00:02:58,077 --> 00:03:01,808
On Iast vacation, two seminarians,

34
00:03:02,048 --> 00:03:05,279
disguised as deviIs,
were caught steaIing chickens.

35
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:06,042
ZozuIia and Lemesh, I mean you!

36
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:13,289
The otherthree
had gotten a deacon drunk,

37
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:17,224
and then goaded him into singing
bawdy, indecent songs!

38
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:19,024
For shame!

39
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,463
And now, Iet us pray together.

40
00:03:21,668 --> 00:03:25,695
Lord, Iet the Light of Thy wisdom
shine down upon us.

41
00:03:31,244 --> 00:03:34,907
And bestow on our hearts
Thy tender mercy.

42
00:03:43,256 --> 00:03:47,283
Preserve us from aII eviI.

43
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:52,894
And Heaven and Earth wiII resound
with gIorious songs of praise.

44
00:03:57,937 --> 00:03:59,905
Amen.

45
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:06,372
Be sure you return in time forthe
Feast of the ImmacuIate Conception!

46
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:53,883
We shouId've spotted a farm
Iong ago.

47
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:57,056
The deviI wouId Iose his way too,
in this darkness.

48
00:05:57,724 --> 00:06:02,627
-Where did the road go?
- There is no road.

49
00:06:03,496 --> 00:06:07,125
Look, KhaIiava, you go that way.
And I'm going overthis way.

50
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,768
And Gorobetz...

51
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:17,042
Hey, Gorobetz!

52
00:06:19,078 --> 00:06:23,037
Damn it, I took a rotten stump
for your head.

53
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:28,048
-What did you find?
-Just fox-hoIes.

54
00:06:38,998 --> 00:06:44,129
-WeII, what do we do?
-Let's sing at the top of our Iungs.

55
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:50,030
Quiet! I know...
Let's sIeep underthe stars.

56
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:53,705
No, KhaIiava, that won't do.

57
00:06:54,947 --> 00:06:59,543
We have to keep Iooking. Someone
might give us a gIass of vodka.

58
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:06,522
Sure, it's betterthan sIeeping
underthe stars.

59
00:07:13,065 --> 00:07:15,533
There's a farmhouse ahead!
Come on!

60
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:37,448
It's our Iast chance, brothers,
to find a pIace to stay.

61
00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:40,888
- Open up!
- HeIIo?

62
00:07:41,093 --> 00:07:45,462
-Who is it?
- KhaIiava, the theoIogian.

63
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:48,133
- Brutus, the phiIosopher.
- Gorobetz, the orator.

64
00:07:48,334 --> 00:07:53,533
No, the house is fuII of peopIe.
Where wouId I put you?

65
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:56,207
Have mercy on us, my good woman!

66
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:59,606
It's unforgivabIe to Iet Christian
souIs perish in the night.

67
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:05,045
-Just somewhere to sIeep...
-And if we do something wrong...

68
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:10,883
AII right, but each of you must
sIeep in a separate pIace.

69
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:13,388
Whatever you wish.

70
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:33,707
- Listen, good woman...
-We're ready to drop with hunger...

71
00:08:33,946 --> 00:08:36,380
It's been so Iong since we've eaten.

72
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:41,679
There's nothing in the house to eat.
I haven't Iit the stove aII day.

73
00:08:41,921 --> 00:08:45,379
Tomorrow we'II see
that you're rewarded handsomeIy.

74
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,357
You couIdn't get a crumb out of
the oId skinfIint. The heII with her!

75
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:57,193
- Boy, I want you to come here.
-Who? Me?

76
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:04,136
You can sIeep in the house.

77
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:19,449
And you, the taII one,
up in the Ioft.

78
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:32,363
-WeII, where do I stay?
- Come with me.

79
00:10:28,661 --> 00:10:30,629
What do you want, granny?

80
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:37,296
No, it's the time of Ient.

81
00:10:37,503 --> 00:10:41,132
And not for aII the goId in the worId
wouId I Iet you tempt me.

82
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:46,977
You're not in the fIower of youth,
you know.

83
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:18,535
What's wrong with you, granny?
Forthe Iove of God!

84
00:12:29,014 --> 00:12:31,676
Good Lord, she's a witch!

85
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:40,282
ShameIess witch!
Put me down! Let me be!

86
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:44,691
In the name of God Jesus Christ,
put me down! Let me be!

87
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:51,301
If I'm not making you fIy,
it must be Christ,

88
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:52,869
and his apostIe, Thomas!

89
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:23,062
Oh, you're kiIIing me!

90
00:15:15,648 --> 00:15:17,275
Khoma!

91
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,617
Scat!

92
00:15:31,797 --> 00:15:35,699
-What we need is tar.
- I know that.

93
00:15:38,804 --> 00:15:43,901
Hey, Khoma, the Rector sent me
to get you. Someone came for you.

94
00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:13,528
Ah, it's you, brother Khoma.

95
00:16:14,106 --> 00:16:17,075
The daughter of one of our
richest Sotniks is dying.

96
00:16:17,242 --> 00:16:20,211
The one who owns the estate
just twenty miIes outside Kiev.

97
00:16:20,412 --> 00:16:24,678
Yesterday, the girI returned home,
beaten aImost to death.

98
00:16:24,917 --> 00:16:28,876
She expressed a wish
that in herfinaI agony,

99
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:33,047
the Iast prayers for her saIvation
be said by you, Khoma Brutus.

100
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:36,690
Why me? I don't even know
how to do that!

101
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:40,456
Don't argue with me.
You wiII Ieave immediateIy.

102
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:44,602
The famous Sotnik was good enough
to send his men and a wagon.

103
00:16:44,803 --> 00:16:47,363
You'II have to get somebody eIse
to go, 'cause I'm not Ieaving!

104
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:51,907
No one asked you
if you wanted to go or not.

105
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,982
Thank your good masterfor his
gift of the honey and the eggs.

106
00:16:57,182 --> 00:17:02,677
And teII him I shaII send the books
as soon as they're ready.

107
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:09,886
And as for you, I suggest you Iearn
to controI that tongue of yours.

108
00:17:10,095 --> 00:17:16,694
Otherwise, I shaII have you Iashed
before the whoIe schooI,

109
00:17:16,935 --> 00:17:20,598
so you won't be abIe
to sit down for a week.

110
00:17:22,007 --> 00:17:25,374
The Lord be with you.
And with your good master.

111
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:33,040
Yavtukh, see that ourfriends have
some vodka before they Ieave.

112
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:39,119
WeII, don'tjust stand there.
Be off with you!

113
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:43,695
And if you know what's good for you,
you'II mend your ways!

114
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:50,361
You'd bettertie up the phiIosopher,
so he won't be tempted to run off.

115
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:57,140
- Good day, my brothers.
- Good day, brother phiIosopher.

116
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:01,377
I've been ordered to traveI
in your company.

117
00:18:04,316 --> 00:18:10,448
-A spIendid carriage!
-Yes, a spacious one!

118
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:14,220
We couId hire some musicians and
dance with aII the room there is.

119
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:39,277
I wonder, if it were fiIIed
with a heavy Ioad,

120
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:42,613
say you Ioaded up the wagon with
saIt or metaI poIes,

121
00:18:42,821 --> 00:18:45,221
can you teII me how many horses
it wouId take?

122
00:18:47,926 --> 00:18:51,692
It wouId take a Iot of horses,
if you have a Iot of saIt.

123
00:18:52,264 --> 00:18:55,290
Can you teII me what sort of iIIness
the girI is cursed with,

124
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:58,766
that requires such soIemn prayers
to deIiver her souI?

125
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:04,060
Sit down, brother phiIosopher.
We're not there, yet.

126
00:20:29,494 --> 00:20:33,453
- Stop!
-An inn! Stop!

127
00:20:39,504 --> 00:20:42,371
Whoa, girI, whoa! We're there.

128
00:20:48,347 --> 00:20:50,440
Let's go in, brother phiIosopher.

129
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:54,681
Spirid, don't forget to water
the horses.

130
00:20:57,322 --> 00:21:00,052
WeIcome, my friends. PIease go
inside.

131
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:03,285
- Do you have vodka?
- Yes, step inside.

132
00:21:17,743 --> 00:21:21,543
My friends, I propose a toast to
the heaIth of the Rector.

133
00:21:24,716 --> 00:21:28,550
Here's to the heaIth of the Rector.

134
00:21:29,655 --> 00:21:31,885
Drink, my good friends.

135
00:21:47,506 --> 00:21:52,910
Oh, the Cossack drinks
on someone eIse's money...

136
00:22:00,585 --> 00:22:02,143
Another round!

137
00:22:04,022 --> 00:22:09,289
Another round!
Serve another round!

138
00:22:12,931 --> 00:22:19,131
I'd Iike to know one thing. Just
what are you seminarians taught?

139
00:22:19,938 --> 00:22:25,433
What the deacon says when he's
in church, or otherthings?

140
00:22:31,983 --> 00:22:37,046
-What a great schoIar.
- I want to be a seminarian too.

141
00:22:37,255 --> 00:22:41,692
Do you think I'm not cIever enough?
I can Iearn anything!

142
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:45,530
Oh good Lord! Lord have mercy
on us!

143
00:22:49,735 --> 00:22:52,898
The Cossack drinks on someone
eIse's...

144
00:22:59,745 --> 00:23:04,205
- I just want to know one thing...
-WiII you Ieave me aIone, you pest?

145
00:23:05,917 --> 00:23:11,514
Don't ask him.
OnIy God knows everything.

146
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:16,683
I just want to know what's
written in those books.

147
00:23:16,928 --> 00:23:22,889
-There couId be otherthings in them.
- How can you taIk that way?

148
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:29,700
- Let me go.
-Why not Iet him go?

149
00:23:31,343 --> 00:23:33,140
PhiIosopher.

150
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:41,151
Don't be afraid, come here.
The master wiII never know.

151
00:23:45,724 --> 00:23:49,626
- Don'tjust stand there. Come on.
- Let me go home, my good brothers.

152
00:23:49,828 --> 00:23:51,762
Let me go home!

153
00:24:27,165 --> 00:24:29,463
The young woman is dead.

154
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:32,537
The girI is dead.

155
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:43,141
Be quiet! The young woman is dead.

156
00:24:43,348 --> 00:24:46,215
- The girI is dead?
- Dead? AIready?

157
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:58,955
Quiet, Serko! The young woman
is dead!

158
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:06,960
Why don't we Iet Khoma go now?

159
00:25:10,642 --> 00:25:16,376
- Of course we'II Iet him go.
- He can do as he wants.

160
00:25:18,416 --> 00:25:20,884
Leave him aIone...

161
00:25:29,494 --> 00:25:31,462
The young woman is dead.

162
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:04,688
Come on, you siIIy pig!

163
00:26:32,157 --> 00:26:36,218
Brother phiIosopher, you're wrong
to try to get out of here.

164
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:39,693
It's not the sort of pIace
you can escape from.

165
00:26:40,165 --> 00:26:44,602
You'd better go to the master.
He is waiting for you.

166
00:26:45,003 --> 00:26:48,905
Why not? I wouId Iove to meet him.

167
00:26:57,182 --> 00:27:00,618
It is not so much the pain of
Iosing you, my dearest daughter,

168
00:27:00,819 --> 00:27:03,788
in the fIower of your youth,
that makes your Ioss more

169
00:27:04,022 --> 00:27:07,890
than a father can bear,

170
00:27:08,093 --> 00:27:11,529
as the torment I suffer

171
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:15,962
at not knowing what monster
was the cause of your death.

172
00:27:26,745 --> 00:27:30,442
Who are you? What is your quaIity,
and where do you come from?

173
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:33,777
From seminary. My name is
Khoma Brutus.

174
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:41,622
-And who was yourfather?
- I don't know.

175
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:46,456
- Your mother, then?
- I never knew her, either.

176
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:50,635
Of course, I must have had one
Iike anyone eIse,

177
00:27:50,802 --> 00:27:54,898
but who she was, or what she was
Iike, I never knew.

178
00:27:56,107 --> 00:27:59,042
How did you make the acquaintance
of my daughter?

179
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:11,980
I never met your daughter, sir.

180
00:28:12,157 --> 00:28:18,062
I know nothing of girIs.
I swear I've never known one.

181
00:28:18,263 --> 00:28:21,460
Why did she name you, then?

182
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:25,693
OnIy God knows why.

183
00:28:27,172 --> 00:28:32,200
The rich peopIe fancy things that
don't make sense even to a schoIar.

184
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:35,709
As the saying goes: When masters
faII out, their men get the cIout.

185
00:28:35,947 --> 00:28:38,142
You're not Iying,
are you, phiIosopher?

186
00:28:38,316 --> 00:28:41,444
God strike me dead if I'm Iying.

187
00:28:53,932 --> 00:28:58,301
If she had Iived a minute Ionger,
I wouId have known everything.

188
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,368
''Let no one say prayers for me,
father,

189
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:07,704
but send men at once
to Kiev Seminary

190
00:29:07,946 --> 00:29:11,609
and teII them to bring here
seminarian Khoma Brutus.

191
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:15,283
And Iet him pray forthree nights
forthe saIvation of my souI.

192
00:29:16,321 --> 00:29:18,289
He knows.''

193
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:24,895
And what he knows,
that I hadn't time to hear.

194
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:36,305
Have you been known
for your chaste Iife?

195
00:29:36,508 --> 00:29:39,909
CouId she hear about you
from someone?

196
00:29:40,178 --> 00:29:46,276
Me? Chaste Iife?
For heaven's sake, sir!

197
00:29:46,484 --> 00:29:52,286
I visited a baker's wife
on Maundy Thursday.

198
00:29:57,929 --> 00:30:00,955
NonetheIess, she named you,
that's aII that counts.

199
00:30:01,933 --> 00:30:05,300
As of tonight, you wiII start
reciting the prayers for her souI.

200
00:30:06,104 --> 00:30:08,538
Yes, but certainIy you want to do
the best thing...

201
00:30:09,574 --> 00:30:14,307
Of course, anyone versed in
the Scriptures couId do it...

202
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:19,542
But the best thing wouId be to have
a deacon, or even a sub-deacon.

203
00:30:19,717 --> 00:30:24,552
They are weII-trained
and wiII do what's necessary.

204
00:30:24,722 --> 00:30:30,456
I haven't got a suitabIe voice. AIso,
I don't have a good appearance.

205
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:34,758
I'II do as my dear chiId
had wanted it.

206
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:37,467
I don't care what it may cost.

207
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:40,604
You wiII start your vigiI tonight,

208
00:30:40,805 --> 00:30:44,297
and recite the prayers forthree
nights,

209
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:47,910
and I shaII reward you handsomeIy
for it. Otherwise...

210
00:30:50,648 --> 00:30:54,049
How couId our dear mistress
abandon us?

211
00:30:56,321 --> 00:31:00,690
Oh, dear chiId, teII us what made
you Ieave us?..

212
00:31:04,262 --> 00:31:08,062
Come back! Come back, beIoved!

213
00:33:10,421 --> 00:33:13,982
May God the Father have mercy
on her souI

214
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:18,223
May God the Son have mercy
on her souI.

215
00:33:18,396 --> 00:33:22,457
May God the HoIy Ghost have
mercy on her souI.

216
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:50,877
Give the phiIosopher his dinner.
Then bring him back to the church.

217
00:34:56,561 --> 00:34:59,530
TeII them how the witch
cast a speII on the huntsman.

218
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:04,527
It's a shame, brother phiIosopher,
that you didn't know Mikitka.

219
00:35:04,735 --> 00:35:09,695
Even his dogs adored him.

220
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:14,309
He was a fine huntsman.

221
00:35:14,479 --> 00:35:21,442
OnIy recentIy he had the misfortune
to faII forthe young mistress.

222
00:35:21,652 --> 00:35:26,282
- Either he feII in Iove with her...
- Or she bewitched him...

223
00:35:26,491 --> 00:35:29,460
No one knows for sure.
But the man was Iost.

224
00:35:30,928 --> 00:35:35,126
One day the girI appeared
in the stabIe and said:

225
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:39,064
''Mikitka, Iet me put my foot on
you to heIp me onto the horse.''

226
00:35:39,237 --> 00:35:42,297
The poor man was so overjoyed,
he said:

227
00:35:42,507 --> 00:35:46,443
''I'd rather you yourseIf cIimbed
onto my back.''

228
00:35:47,245 --> 00:35:50,703
And the fooI took her onto his
back, and went gaIIoping away!

229
00:35:53,184 --> 00:35:57,883
It's time we take the phiIosopher
to where the corpse is Iying.

230
00:36:42,266 --> 00:36:45,702
We'II Ieave you now.

231
00:36:47,505 --> 00:36:51,908
-Just pray in earnest.
- The best of Iuck to you.

232
00:36:52,343 --> 00:36:56,609
Forgive us, but we must Iock you
up in. By order of the master.

233
00:36:56,948 --> 00:36:59,883
That's aII right. It's no more
than three nights of work.

234
00:37:00,084 --> 00:37:03,884
And then the master wiII fiII
both of my pockets with goId.

235
00:37:42,727 --> 00:37:44,695
There's nothing to fear.

236
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:49,298
She won't rise up out of her coffin.
Even corpses fearthe word of God.

237
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:53,596
Am I right? AbsoIuteIy.
You better stay there.

238
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:59,300
Don't you know that a Cossack
doesn't fear anything?

239
00:38:02,813 --> 00:38:05,145
There's no way for anyone
to come in.

240
00:38:05,316 --> 00:38:08,877
And from corpses,
I have prayers to protect me.

241
00:38:09,587 --> 00:38:13,785
As soon as I speak the hoIy words,
no demon can possibIy harm me.

242
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:18,527
They'II nevertouch me!

243
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:34,968
What am I scared of?
I just had too much to drink.

244
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:43,151
Ah, candIes... That's good.

245
00:38:44,588 --> 00:38:49,389
Lots of candIes... to chase away...

246
00:38:50,728 --> 00:38:54,687
the gIoom from the church...
and Iight it up.

247
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:26,963
It's nothing, onIy three nights.

248
00:39:30,401 --> 00:39:36,897
The church shouId be fuII of Iight.
CheerfuI and bright.

249
00:39:37,108 --> 00:39:39,042
There's nothing to fear.

250
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:44,605
She won't touch me now, wiII she!

251
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:06,361
Ow! Oh, Satan!
May God forgive me, poor sinner.

252
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:10,374
Lots of Iight, now.

253
00:40:13,811 --> 00:40:15,540
WeII, Iet's begin.

254
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:18,544
BIessed are... O Lord...

255
00:40:20,184 --> 00:40:24,143
BIessed are they that fear
the AImighty.

256
00:40:24,321 --> 00:40:28,621
And they that Iive according
to Thy Word.

257
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:33,363
I wish it were not prohibited
to smoke in the House of God.

258
00:40:34,665 --> 00:40:37,463
They that honor Thy commandments,
waIk in the path of righteousness.

259
00:40:37,668 --> 00:40:40,068
They that praise Thee
in the hope of eternaI...

260
00:40:40,237 --> 00:40:42,467
What's wrong with some snuff?

261
00:40:46,343 --> 00:40:52,873
A good sniff,
to cIearthe brain.

262
00:41:14,104 --> 00:41:17,471
MercifuI Father! Thou art my
strength...

263
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:30,142
She's a witch! Awitch come
to haunt me!

264
00:41:34,024 --> 00:41:37,050
Sacred circIe, save me!
Sacred circIe, protect me!

265
00:41:37,261 --> 00:41:39,229
Oh, my God.

266
00:41:39,797 --> 00:41:45,064
Sacred circIe, save me!
Sacred circIe, protect me!

267
00:41:50,741 --> 00:41:52,072
Away, Satan! Away!

268
00:41:53,644 --> 00:41:56,613
BIessed are they that fear
the AImighty...

269
00:42:00,918 --> 00:42:03,045
Away! Away with you!

270
00:42:10,094 --> 00:42:13,461
God in Heaven, I caII on Thee
for heIp...

271
00:43:13,924 --> 00:43:15,255
Stay away!

272
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:31,062
- There's the phiIosopher!
- He's finished.

273
00:44:39,943 --> 00:44:42,036
It's a IoveIy pIace to Iive!

274
00:44:42,946 --> 00:44:45,881
You couId fish aII day in that
river.

275
00:44:54,324 --> 00:44:55,689
OId man!

276
00:44:57,027 --> 00:45:00,428
I'm not going inside.
I'II sIeep right here.

277
00:45:00,931 --> 00:45:03,900
It's not aIIowed, phiIosopher.
I have my orders.

278
00:45:13,477 --> 00:45:18,039
- Have you got some borsch for us?
-We have, you oId deviI.

279
00:45:18,348 --> 00:45:22,375
- How does it taste?
-Ask the phiIosopher.

280
00:45:44,508 --> 00:45:47,705
-WeII?
-What did go on?

281
00:46:00,157 --> 00:46:05,060
Nothing much. Just some noises.

282
00:47:35,252 --> 00:47:39,985
A Cossack doesn't fear anything
in this worId.

283
00:47:47,931 --> 00:47:49,899
Let's go, Yavtukh.

284
00:48:39,483 --> 00:48:42,680
A Cossack is never afraid of
anything.

285
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:51,895
It's true, the first time, you reaIIy
are afraid.

286
00:48:52,095 --> 00:48:54,893
But after a whiIe, you're not
so afraid.

287
00:48:55,098 --> 00:48:57,896
And afterthat, you're not afraid
at aII!

288
00:49:04,241 --> 00:49:09,042
Because there's nothing
that can do me any harm.

289
00:49:20,824 --> 00:49:23,884
Lord God! Let not Thy divine AngeI
be turned against me.

290
00:49:24,094 --> 00:49:27,063
I ask Thee to spare me
Thy terribIe wrath.

291
00:49:27,664 --> 00:49:33,068
Have mercy upon Thy servant.
I know my spirit's weak.

292
00:49:34,938 --> 00:49:41,707
God, save me from my weaknesses,
preserve my heart from sin,

293
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:46,279
my souI from eviI...

294
00:49:46,483 --> 00:49:48,883
Strengthen my spirit
and protect me

295
00:49:49,086 --> 00:49:52,021
from the temptations of eviI.

296
00:49:52,222 --> 00:49:53,689
Have mercy on...

297
00:49:54,324 --> 00:49:57,691
God AImighty, save me!
HeavenIy Father, save me!

298
00:50:00,731 --> 00:50:03,700
O Lord!
Save me from the demon!

299
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:08,904
O Lord!
Save me from the demon!

300
00:50:09,106 --> 00:50:11,540
God, give me strength!

301
00:50:15,746 --> 00:50:19,614
HoIy Father in Heaven!
Save me from the eviI one!

302
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,231
Khoma!

303
00:50:42,172 --> 00:50:43,901
Khoma!

304
00:51:46,002 --> 00:51:52,305
By the shades of night, may he go
bIind, turn his hair white.

305
00:51:52,509 --> 00:51:57,310
Bewitch him.
Cover him with snow.

306
00:52:32,749 --> 00:52:36,150
Hey, phiIosopher! On yourfeet!

307
00:53:24,734 --> 00:53:29,068
I want music!
I want to have music right now!

308
00:54:11,748 --> 00:54:15,548
From the Iooks of it, he'II dance
aII day, that feIIow.

309
00:54:15,719 --> 00:54:18,882
Yes, he can dance for a Iong time.

310
00:54:19,322 --> 00:54:23,691
- Hey, phiIosopher, what's wrong?
- Don't you see? I'm dancing.

311
00:54:26,162 --> 00:54:29,131
Oh, your hair has turned white!

312
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:35,126
As white as miIk.
Just Iike good oId Yavtukh.

313
00:54:38,808 --> 00:54:43,302
I must taIk to your master.
I'II expIain everything.

314
00:54:45,015 --> 00:54:47,449
I don't want to pray there again!

315
00:55:02,732 --> 00:55:09,535
What? It's aII going weII?
Were you abIe to stay awake?

316
00:55:11,341 --> 00:55:13,741
Yes, I was abIe to stay awake.

317
00:55:13,943 --> 00:55:18,971
The deviI Iives in this house. I want
to skip out whiIe I'm in one piece.

318
00:55:19,182 --> 00:55:23,380
-What do you mean?
- It's your daughter, sir...

319
00:55:24,087 --> 00:55:28,615
She may have nobIe bIood
in her veins, no doubt about that,

320
00:55:28,825 --> 00:55:32,886
however, may God have mercy
on her souI...

321
00:55:33,096 --> 00:55:37,294
-What about my daughter?
- She's in Ieague with the deviI.

322
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:40,901
She won't Iet me read
the Scriptures in front of her.

323
00:55:41,104 --> 00:55:44,301
You wiII read, since she summoned
you.

324
00:55:45,241 --> 00:55:48,768
She did not wish to bear
a spirituaI burden to the grave.

325
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:52,379
The onIy way to assure her saIvation
was to have the prayers said.

326
00:55:52,816 --> 00:55:56,877
ReIease me, I beg you!
Don't make me go through with it.

327
00:55:57,087 --> 00:56:00,682
You wiII read!
There'sjust one more night.

328
00:56:01,725 --> 00:56:05,684
You'II do godIy work,
and I wiII reward you.

329
00:56:07,731 --> 00:56:10,757
For aII the goId in the worId...

330
00:56:13,803 --> 00:56:17,899
I wouIdn't read another prayer.

331
00:56:18,108 --> 00:56:19,905
That's enough!

332
00:56:22,846 --> 00:56:24,711
PhiIosopher...

333
00:56:27,016 --> 00:56:29,678
You're wrong if you think you can
trifIe with me.

334
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:35,053
That sort of thing is fit forthe
seminary, but I'II not toIerate it.

335
00:56:36,326 --> 00:56:40,456
I'II orderthe guards to Iash you.

336
00:56:42,098 --> 00:56:45,898
There's nothing so excruciating as
as the Ieather Iash on raw fIesh.

337
00:56:46,102 --> 00:56:47,899
I know that.

338
00:56:48,104 --> 00:56:52,905
More than haIf a dozen
are unbearabIe.

339
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:56,910
However, what you don't know
is how expert my men are at it.

340
00:56:57,947 --> 00:57:05,285
They Iash you, then we give them
some vodka and they begin again.

341
00:57:09,426 --> 00:57:11,394
You may go.

342
00:57:13,730 --> 00:57:15,891
Go back to your duties.

343
00:57:17,734 --> 00:57:21,465
If you faiI to do them,
you'II have a thousand Iashes.

344
00:57:22,806 --> 00:57:26,207
And if you do them,
one thousand goId pieces.

345
00:58:58,334 --> 00:59:02,600
Athousand goId pieces!
The oId miser was sureIy Iying.

346
00:59:03,506 --> 00:59:07,772
Never mind, good master,
I'II run away from here so fast

347
00:59:08,011 --> 00:59:11,139
that even your dogs wiII never
catch up with me.

348
00:59:47,016 --> 00:59:50,144
You shouId know betterthan
make such a detour.

349
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:54,117
You nearIy ruined yourfine robe.

350
00:59:57,927 --> 01:00:03,126
That wouId've been a shame.
How much did you pay for one yard?

351
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:13,605
Why don't you keep your mouth
shut, dear oId Yavtukh?

352
01:00:32,328 --> 01:00:34,888
FooIish dog.

353
01:01:20,343 --> 01:01:24,040
Not hungry? Then Iet's go to
the church.

354
01:01:33,656 --> 01:01:38,889
Are you scared? That witch wiII
give you the time of your Iife.

355
01:01:40,096 --> 01:01:43,463
Scared of a witch?
Nothing scares a Cossack!

356
01:01:44,934 --> 01:01:48,529
I stood it fortwo nights.
With God's heIp, I'II make it three.

357
01:01:52,742 --> 01:01:56,371
She's haunting me because
she's got the DeviI inside her.

358
01:01:56,579 --> 01:01:59,707
I'd hate to think what sin she's
guiIty of.

359
01:02:06,589 --> 01:02:09,615
Brother phiIosopher, it's time
to go.

360
01:02:09,826 --> 01:02:12,124
Let's go to the church, dear.

361
01:02:25,942 --> 01:02:31,209
- Think of the torment she's in.
- He was fated to go through it.

362
01:02:42,725 --> 01:02:49,756
I'II read forthe third night,
and I'II get a thousand goId pieces.

363
01:02:49,999 --> 01:02:53,696
I'II have a baII then, won't I,
Yavtukh?

364
01:02:54,937 --> 01:03:01,433
Go say your prayers, phiIosopher.

365
01:03:22,165 --> 01:03:26,465
I won't be afraid. I swear,
I won't be afraid.

366
01:04:10,413 --> 01:04:15,441
Lord God! From the depths of heII,
I cry out to Thee.

367
01:04:15,651 --> 01:04:18,449
I pray Thee, have pity on me.

368
01:04:18,654 --> 01:04:20,884
Take heed of my cries.

369
01:04:21,090 --> 01:04:23,684
Drive out the terrorthat dweIIs
in my heart.

370
01:04:23,926 --> 01:04:27,885
Let me not yieId to the temptations
of the eviI one.

371
01:04:28,331 --> 01:04:30,458
Lord God, heIp me...

372
01:04:30,666 --> 01:04:35,467
Thou art my Fortress...

373
01:04:36,572 --> 01:04:39,132
My Redeemer, and my Savior...

374
01:04:45,815 --> 01:04:50,275
God AImighty!
Smite her with Iightning!

375
01:04:50,486 --> 01:04:54,286
Send down Thy wrath!
Strike her down with Thy fury!

376
01:04:54,690 --> 01:04:59,889
A curse upon you!
With the wings of a bat!

377
01:05:02,798 --> 01:05:04,060
With the bIood of a serpent!

378
01:05:04,934 --> 01:05:07,801
I shaII curse you!

379
01:05:09,171 --> 01:05:12,072
Curse you!

380
01:05:46,175 --> 01:05:49,702
I summon the vampires!
I summon the werewoIves!

381
01:06:14,036 --> 01:06:18,200
I summon the vampires!
I summon the werewoIves!

382
01:06:55,945 --> 01:06:58,311
I summon Viy!

383
01:07:00,216 --> 01:07:02,810
Bring Viy here!

384
01:07:33,182 --> 01:07:36,674
Get him! Get him!

385
01:07:39,422 --> 01:07:44,621
Raise my eyeIids.
I cannot see!

386
01:07:44,827 --> 01:07:47,091
Don't Iook him in the eye,
or you're Iost.

387
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:06,438
A cock.

388
01:08:06,949 --> 01:08:08,678
I see him!

389
01:08:09,085 --> 01:08:15,786
Get away from me, you fiends!
HeIp!

390
01:09:39,408 --> 01:09:45,608
- The Fates were unkind to Khoma.
- It was the wiII of God.

391
01:09:46,815 --> 01:09:48,783
Let's drink to him, may his souI
rest in peace.

392
01:09:56,926 --> 01:09:59,520
Khoma was a fine young man.

393
01:10:04,333 --> 01:10:06,893
The kind of man I admire.

394
01:10:10,339 --> 01:10:13,536
-But his Iife was wasted for nothing.
- I know where he went wrong.

395
01:10:14,343 --> 01:10:19,303
If he hadn't been afraid,
the witch couIdn't have harmed him.

396
01:10:19,481 --> 01:10:24,680
He shouId've spit on hertaiI,
and make the sign of the cross.

397
01:10:25,721 --> 01:10:27,689
If anyone shouId know, I do.

398
01:10:27,923 --> 01:10:31,882
In Kiev, the women who run staIIs
in the market are aII witches.

399
01:10:32,928 --> 01:10:35,055
He wouIdn't be dead if he hadn't
been afraid.

400
01:10:36,732 --> 01:10:41,897
- No one can prove he's dead.
- That's what everyone says.

401
01:10:42,938 --> 01:10:45,463
Maybe they imagined it.

402
01:10:45,641 --> 01:10:49,304
That stuff about how he died,
because of the witch.

403
01:10:49,478 --> 01:10:53,710
After I've had a fIask of vodka,
even I begin to see witches.

404
01:10:59,922 --> 01:11:02,891
Suppose he wasn't dead?

405
01:11:05,427 --> 01:11:09,227
Suppose that the one waIking
this way now... was him!

406
01:11:14,570 --> 01:11:16,697
Now that's a good one!

407
01:11:26,015 --> 01:11:28,677
-Are you working?
-We're working.

408
01:11:30,919 --> 01:11:33,285
Keep on working then.

409
01:11:46,268 --> 01:11:54,607
The End
