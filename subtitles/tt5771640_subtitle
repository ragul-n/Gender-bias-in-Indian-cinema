1
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,605
A WEDDING

2
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:00,130
Inspired by true events.

3
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,889
Does it have a soul?
I don't know how to answer that.

4
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,601
They say before forty days, it has no soul.
I don't know how to answer that.

5
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,768
Is its heart beating?
Yes.

6
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,320
It's already beating?
That's right.

7
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,890
You still have seven weeks
to think it over.

8
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:23,250
It won't change in seven weeks?
Of course it will.

9
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,607
But we can still do it.

10
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,889
After twelve weeks,
we can no longer intervene.

11
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:32,370
But that's just it...

12
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,367
What if I still want this
after twelve weeks?

13
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:38,245
We'll arrange for you to go to Holland.

14
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,722
You can do it in Holland?
Yes, up to eighteen weeks.

15
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,321
They're very competent.
Do you speak Dutch?

16
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,409
A little.
You'll be fine.

17
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,081
It'll be more expensive.
How much?

18
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,449
Excluding travel costs
and other expenses, 800 euros.

19
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:53,441
800 euros.

20
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,207
And here'?

21
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,126
If you have insurance,
it's 3.50 euros.

22
00:01:59,127 --> 00:02:01,361
3.50 euros for everything?
Yes.

23
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:06,961
For the insurance forms,
it mustn't go on record.

24
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,202
No one will know.

25
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,681
Even if anyone intervenes,
your privacy is protected.

26
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,684
Your parents will never know.
They're not the problem.

27
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,406
I respect doctor-patient confidentiality,
as does everyone here.

28
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,129
I wanted to ask you...

29
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,967
Have you done this before?
What do you mean?

30
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,242
Have you ever been in my situation?

31
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,971
Why do you ask?

32
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,966
I don't know.

33
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,162
Do you consider it serious'?

34
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,168
To take out a baby?

35
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,802
It's not a baby, it's an embryo.
We take out an embryo.

36
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,770
I think it's serious.

37
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,648
Wednesday.
Can't they do it earlier?

38
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,965
No, you need a week between
the first meeting and the operation.

39
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,566
Never less.
Why?

40
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,531
To make sure that
this is what I really want.

41
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,322
Normally, it takes even longer,
but I insisted on doing it quickly.

42
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,042
OK.

43
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,089
<i>I have a Pakistani inside me.</i>

44
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,846
<i>I know.</i>

45
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,809
<i>It's Pakistani, a Muslim.</i>

46
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,090
<i>I know. Zahira, I know.</i>

47
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,288
<i>When are you working in the shop?</i>

48
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,203
<i>Tomorrow.
OK, tomorrow's good.</i>

49
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,244
We <i>agreed.
You'll talk to him tomorrow.</i>

50
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,640
<i>We'll see.</i>

51
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,286
<i>Alright.</i>

52
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,164
<i>Promise you'll talk to him.</i>

53
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,567
<i>Promise.</i>

54
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,445
<i>I'll talk to him.</i>

55
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,526
Happy?

56
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,610
That's it.
Just a bit more.

57
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,887
<i>Gently.</i>

58
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:31,249
<i>Add the spices. Not too much.</i>

59
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,722
Looks good.

60
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:50,761
Just a moment, Fares.
This is important.

61
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,243
Zahira's very first biryani.

62
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,681
<i>We'll see.</i>

63
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,969
We haven't tasted it yet.

64
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,126
Wait.

65
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,645
No, it's alright.

66
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,162
Yes, if all goes well.

67
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,604
They think the operation is Wednesday.
But I'm not going.

68
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,728
Yes, I understand.

69
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,645
OK, tomorrow after class.

70
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,047
At five.

71
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,325
Tariq?

72
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,968
There's still a chance.

73
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,731
How much will it cost?

74
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,851
3.50 euros.

75
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,128
What?
I know, it's crazy.

76
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,211
My cardiologist costs 100 euros.

77
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,724
He found the name for what I have.
The syndrome...

78
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,971
Brugada.
That's it.

79
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,363
Brugada syndrome. 100 euros.

80
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,727
<i>Dad?
Yes.</i>

81
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,722
Zahira wants you to meet Tariq.

82
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,526
Why?

83
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:11,365
She says it's important.
He's the kid's father.

84
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,126
There is no kid.

85
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,562
But...

86
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,810
They're willing to get married.

87
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,604
Tariq is a Muslim.

88
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,523
He's Pakistani.
That changes everything.

89
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,611
What are you playing at?
Nothing.

90
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,851
I just want things to work out.

91
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,083
Wednesday will be a start.
That'll sort out her life.

92
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:45,046
And Hina?
What about Hina?

93
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,690
What does Hina think?

94
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,088
If she knew, she'd agree with us.

95
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,210
I don't think you fully understand.
I do understand.

96
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,287
I understand,
but I also understand Zahira.

97
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,079
You understand her?

98
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,242
Yes, I understand her perfectly.

99
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,289
You do?
Yes.

100
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,799
You'll be late for school.

101
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,609
I spoke to him
but he won't hear of it.

102
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,684
Do you agree with him?
What?

103
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,251
Do you agree
or are you scared of him?

104
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,726
It's not that I agree,
but I do understand him.

105
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,166
You know how he is.

106
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,965
<i>You're on his side?</i>

107
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,562
<i>No, that's not it.</i>

108
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,122
<i>What will you do without your family?</i>

109
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:21,250
<i>Zahira, you'll be alone...
I'm not alone. I've got Tariq.</i>

110
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,447
<i>Tariq?</i>

111
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,726
Hello.
Hello.

112
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,241
<i>Do you know how lucky you are?</i>

113
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,079
<i>Lucky?</i>

114
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,684
<i>Of course.</i>

115
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:39,842
<i>If you go on Wednesday,
everything will work out fine.</i>

116
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,446
<i>In another family,
it'd be much worse.</i>

117
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,687
I'm not going.

118
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,520
If you don't, it'll be bad.
Do you hear me?

119
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,644
Think about what you're doing.

120
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,005
It'll be bad.

121
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:57,681
Will you always be there for me?
Of course.

122
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:58,847
<i>Promise me.</i>

123
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,408
<i>I'll always be there for you.</i>

124
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,570
Alright?
Yes.

125
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,683
Catch your breath,
teacher's late.

126
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,166
Well, Miss Zahira.
You're running late.

127
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:59,364
You still haven't learned
the importance of punctuality.

128
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:02,723
Without punctuality,
human potential is wasted.

129
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,089
What good is talent and intelligence
if you're not reliable?

130
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,130
And if you're late...
You're not reliable.

131
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,964
It's our turn, Tariq.

132
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,050
Our turn, our life.

133
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,530
It's now.

134
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,643
It's your decision?
Yes.

135
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,610
Not your family's?
No. I don't want this.

136
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,570
If we don't keep it...

137
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,965
it's over between us.

138
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,811
Do you understand?

139
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,686
I know.

140
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,851
I'm sorry.

141
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,365
I'm sorry.

142
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,525
I'm sorry.

143
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,526
I'm sorry.

144
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,206
Can I see the screen?
Why?

145
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,170
I don't know.
It's very technical, you know.

146
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,526
Can we see...
Are you sure this is what you want?

147
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,881
<i>Yes.</i>

148
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,849
I'm going to disinfect you.

149
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,126
Will someone pick you up?

150
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,567
My brother's waiting for me.
Good.

151
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,200
Will you be able to rest tomorrow?
Yes.

152
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,681
When can I go back to school?

153
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,524
In a couple of days.

154
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,441
Where does it go?

155
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:58,082
What?
Well, the baby.

156
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,327
What do you mean?

157
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,650
Once you take it out,
where does it go?

158
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,882
Miss, it's not a baby.

159
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,804
OK, but where does it go?

160
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,810
Everything we extract
is placed in a plastic bag

161
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,365
which is then frozen.

162
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,281
Frozen.

163
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,247
The bag will go to a company

164
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,966
specialized in the burning
of medical waste.

165
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,321
Burning.

166
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,008
Can we just wait a moment?

167
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,447
Wait?
Yes.

168
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,685
Just a while.
As you wish.

169
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,287
I think... I'd rather stop.

170
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,091
Are you sure?

171
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:46,967
<i>Yes.</i>

172
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,401
I'm sorry...

173
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,809
Don't worry about us.
It's no problem at all.

174
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,561
Thank you.

175
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,681
Zahira?

176
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,567
Where were you?
I'm right here.

177
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,245
I called twenty-five times.

178
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,209
You didn't answer.
I'm here.

179
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,650
Did it go OK?

180
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,128
Did it hurt?
Not really.

181
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,841
Are you OK?

182
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,845
<i>Daughter,</i>

183
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,850
<i>your mother and I...
didn't know</i> each other <i>either.</i>

184
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,641
<i>And look.</i>

185
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:36,608
I was stressed on our wedding day,
like a madman.

186
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,203
What's she like? Pretty?

187
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,850
Will I like her?

188
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,968
<i>I was in the same state.</i>

189
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:47,202
That evening, I made her laugh.
It was wonderful.

190
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,761
One of the greatest nights
of my life.

191
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,329
Here, you can choose.

192
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:57,081
Other families aren't like this.
Here, you have the choice.

193
00:19:57,082 --> 00:20:02,041
<i>After the mess you made,
everything can still work out.</i>

194
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:05,046
<i>This is an incredible opportunity, Zahira.</i>

195
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,085
And you'll be able to talk to them.

196
00:20:07,086 --> 00:20:08,525
We'll arrange all this.

197
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:11,001
I'm going to Pakistan?
No, no.

198
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,969
They're coming here then?
No.

199
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,250
You'll see them online.

200
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,007
OK.

201
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:21,090
<i>We have to keep up with the times.</i>

202
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:09,761
Hi, three mojitos
and a sparkling water.

203
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,128
Lemon or lime?
Lime.

204
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:17,962
Thanks.

205
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,284
Bye.
Bye.

206
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,050
Did you tell him I'd be here?

207
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,248
Maybe.
But I didn't ask you.

208
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,647
I haven't committed a crime.
Neither has he.

209
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,285
No, neither has he.

210
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,886
Here, this is for you.

211
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,204
Cheers.
Cheers.

212
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,081
Are you alright?

213
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:49,286
Please, get up.
It's OK, I'll stay down here with you.

214
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:50,522
Please, get up.

215
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,721
Are you sure?
Yes.

216
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,521
We have to go.

217
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,648
Why?
I'll explain later.

218
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,889
Why are we leaving?
I'll tell you later.

219
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,243
Why aren't you allowed to go out?

220
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,210
It's tradition.

221
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,450
But your brother goes out.
Yes.

222
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:17,331
So, tradition says:
"No nightclubs for Zahira"?

223
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,319
If you like.

224
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:22,403
Does tradition also say:
"No Ardennes for Zahira"?

225
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,081
I reckon so.

226
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,239
That's a shame.

227
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,049
My uncle has a place in the Ardennes.

228
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,689
Well, that's tradition for you.

229
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:34,290
Right. Tradition is useful
when I feel like saying "no".

230
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,327
I'll be off then.

231
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:42,842
Thanks.

232
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,645
That made my night.

233
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,248
Good luck.

234
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,167
This one's a sort of
Pakistani Freddy Mercury.

235
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,849
Jeez, even the third one.

236
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,888
He's the worst of all.

237
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:27,889
Here.

238
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:35,570
Why not buy some time?
How?

239
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,529
Just do what they want.

240
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,890
What are they asking you to do?

241
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,208
Talk to all three,
get to know them.

242
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:44,840
Well, do it.
When do you talk to the first one?

243
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,082
Tonight or tomorrow.

244
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,647
You'll work it out.

245
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:53,288
I don't know.
But you can't marry one of those guys.

246
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,647
Drop it, Aurore.
What would you know?

247
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:58,849
Don't chew me out.
No, sorry.

248
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:56,967
Did you know I spoke to lmran?
lmran? Who's he?

249
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,202
My future husband,
for your information.

250
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,761
A cousin from back home,
in the photos.

251
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,447
When did you talk to him?
Last night on Skype.

252
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,564
Mum woke me up for it.

253
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:10,647
And?
And? It was horrible.

254
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,651
You don't like him?

255
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,368
No, I don't.
Of course I don't.

256
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:19,208
What do other girls do?
I don't know.

257
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,606
And I don't give a damn.

258
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,080
You're the only one.

259
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:26,202
Only you resist.
Yes, I resist.

260
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,247
Of course I resist.

261
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:31,724
Did you see what Mum was like
when she heard you were pregnant?

262
00:28:31,725 --> 00:28:33,051
And Dad, with his heart?

263
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,848
They're your family, Zahira.

264
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,131
God is watching you.
God is watching us all.

265
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,570
Look at Hina.
Does she seem unhappy?

266
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:51,206
Zahira? Ls Hina unhappy?

267
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,363
Follow your sister's example.

268
00:28:53,364 --> 00:28:55,681
You take after her
in every other way, but not this.

269
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,331
Is Hina weak?

270
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,730
Does she have no character?

271
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,850
You're the only one.

272
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,966
Only you.

273
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,401
Everything alright?

274
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:12,722
<i>Fine.</i>

275
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:18,168
Leave the phone alone, Amara.
Put it down.

276
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,888
<i>I'm very happy-</i>

277
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,328
<i>The big moment has arrived.</i>

278
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,527
<i>I can finally give you this.</i>

279
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,606
<i>Go and try it on in your room.</i>

280
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:10,961
Hello.

281
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,127
Hello.

282
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,801
How are you?

283
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,079
I don't know...

284
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,684
I don't know what to say.

285
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,845
You're very...

286
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,371
You're very pretty.

287
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,651
What do you like?

288
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,125
What do I like?

289
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:37,323
Yes.
I like watching films.

290
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,651
Me too.

291
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,644
Just a moment.

292
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,366
There.

293
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,849
Can I just ask...

294
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:06,202
How come you speak French?

295
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,251
We lived with my uncle

296
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,368
in France, for fifteen years.

297
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:13,242
He still speaks French with me.

298
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,085
Do you speak Pakistani?

299
00:32:18,086 --> 00:32:19,241
<i>Yes, of course.</i>

300
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,249
<i>You are very beautiful.</i>

301
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,371
I wanted to tell you...

302
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,651
I have to tell you...

303
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,131
It's important.

304
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,247
As soon as I saw your photo...

305
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,321
What photo?

306
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,082
Your mother sent me a photo of you.

307
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:41,402
When I saw it, I knew.

308
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,321
You knew what?

309
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:48,083
I knew that I love you.

310
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,728
<i>I love you.</i>

311
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:00,890
Just by touching the photo...

312
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:04,082
It's hard to say, but...

313
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,730
I know that I love you.

314
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,005
Mum's here.

315
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:54,965
It's done. She's chosen Adnan.
<i>What?</i>

316
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,165
<i>I'm telling you,</i>

317
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,649
<i>Adnan is the one she has chosen.</i>

318
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,641
For sure?
It's done, I'm telling you.

319
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:04,961
<i>Thank you, God.</i>

320
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,967
Been there long?
No.

321
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,971
You OK'?

322
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:36,370
I can't come on Friday.

323
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:39,450
OK, Saturday then.
No, I can't.

324
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:41,842
I don't want to.
You don't want to what?

325
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,527
I don't want to.

326
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:46,447
What?
Have fun, hang out, see me?

327
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:48,762
Exactly. I don't want to see you.

328
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:52,451
You came to see me
to say you don't want to see me.

329
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:53,602
Right.

330
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,963
So, you're giving me the elbow?

331
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,328
Right.

332
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,646
That makes sense.

333
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:02,971
Yes, it does.

334
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:05,887
What's wrong?

335
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,966
We can't, Pierre.
It's too dangerous.

336
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,321
Dangerous?

337
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:14,606
You could get killed.
I see...

338
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:18,207
You wouldn't understand.
So now what?

339
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,449
We let it go because you're scared?

340
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:33,727
Yes?

341
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,243
<i>Turn off the light and go to bed.</i>

342
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,289
<i>I have to wake you up earlier tomorrow.</i>

343
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:45,247
<i>Earlier?
So you can Skype with Adnan.</i>

344
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,444
<i>Now's the time to tell him.</i>

345
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,405
<i>Tell Adnan?</i>

346
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:50,607
<i>Yes.</i>

347
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,004
<i>He couldn't do it later.
He has to</i> go to work.

348
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,210
What couldn't he do later?

349
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:12,522
<i>Don't make me repeat myself.
You know what I mean.</i>

350
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,890
But I haven't decided.

351
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,599
<i>Adnan is the one you chose.</i>

352
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,170
No. I don't like any of them.

353
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,361
None of them.

354
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,804
<i>I don't understand.</i>

355
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:31,290
<i>You told me that
Adnan was very nice.</i>

356
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:34,410
<i>You said he was kind to you.</i>

357
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,079
Yes, he's very nice.

358
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:39,970
<i>He's the only one who speaks French.</i>

359
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:41,531
<i>What's your problem?</i>

360
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,968
<i>About the other two, you said:</i>

361
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,441
"I hate them."

362
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:50,887
Don't take this lightly, Zahira.

363
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:56,445
<i>Adnan is the one you have chosen.</i>

364
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,406
Right?

365
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,646
<i>Yes.</i>

366
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,763
<i>I'll say this one last time.</i>

367
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,644
<i>To be totally clear.</i>

368
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:13,286
<i>lmran was the first one you spoke to.</i>

369
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,681
<i>The second was Tanver.</i>

370
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:19,366
<i>The last one was Adnan.</i>

371
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,005
<i>The one who is nice.</i>

372
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:23,128
<i>The one who speaks French.</i>

373
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,645
<i>The one you like best.</i>

374
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:28,761
Adnan's the one you like best.

375
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,367
<i>Yes.</i>

376
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,210
<i>Perfect. Then Adnan it is.</i>

377
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,281
<i>Yes.</i>

378
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:43,640
<i>Tomorrow morning,
you will talk to him on Skype.</i>

379
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,969
ls everything clear?

380
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,811
Crystal clear.

381
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:53,607
Good.

382
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,450
<i>It's time to sleep.</i>

383
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:19,165
It's Zahira. She slept at Aurore's.
Thank God.

384
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,839
I'll go get her.

385
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:23,650
Is she coming home?
Don't worry, I'll bring her back.

386
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:26,571
What did she say?
Dad, I'll handle this, OK?

387
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:34,886
I spoke to my father.
He'll be home later than expected.

388
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,045
He won't be here until Wednesday.

389
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,850
Did you tell him?
Of course.

390
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,886
Since my mother left,
we've got plenty of room.

391
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:47,085
I've got to thank you.

392
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:53,687
It's Amir.

393
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,085
I'll talk to him.

394
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:07,281
Well?

395
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,007
Well...

396
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:13,965
She's not coming home.

397
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:18,965
What? What did she say?
She said...

398
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:22,371
she'll come back
if we don't force her to marry.

399
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,682
And that she loves us.

400
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:29,967
Is that all?

401
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,728
Yes. She doesn't want to marry, Dad.

402
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,201
If we want her to marry,
she won't come home.

403
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:44,321
What's wrong?

404
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:46,969
Zahira's staying with Aurore.

405
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,245
She doesn't want to marry.

406
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:52,201
What?
You heard me.

407
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:54,249
<i>She refuses to get married.</i>

408
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,570
<i>My God.</i>

409
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:59,999
<i>No.</i>

410
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,650
<i>This can't be.</i>

411
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:04,282
<i>Stop. Don't hurt yourself.</i>

412
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:08,328
Stop, Dad.

413
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,240
<i>What a shame.</i>

414
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:11,767
Stop.

415
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:14,003
<i>She'll be the death of us.</i>

416
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:15,407
Stop.

417
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:18,560
<i>She's the bane of our lives.</i>

418
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:23,447
This is Zahira.
I can't answer right now...

419
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:25,571
Stop it.

420
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:34,046
This is Zahira.
I can't answer right now...

421
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:36,241
Stop it.

422
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:20,008
They slammed doors
as they returned,

423
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:22,168
laughing loudly in the hall.

424
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:23,725
They passed before you,

425
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:26,247
insolent and spineless,
smelling of wine.

426
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:29,324
Once, I hid behind a door.
It was early in the morning.

427
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:31,329
We had just got up
and they were returning.

428
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,081
Polynices saw me.

429
00:43:33,082 --> 00:43:36,084
He was pale, his eyes shining,
so handsome in his evening clothes.

430
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:38,527
He said to me: "Oh, you're here?"

431
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:41,809
He gave me a big paper flower
he had brought home.

432
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,968
And you kept that flower, didn't you?

433
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:46,967
Last night,
before you crept out,

434
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:50,442
you looked at it for a time
to give you courage, didn't you?

435
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:52,326
Did you know your brother?

436
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:55,079
I knew
you would speak ill of him.

437
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:57,447
Very good.
You can sit back down.

438
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:00,164
Now, you have one page

439
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:02,766
to answer this simple question:

440
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:06,288
In what ways
did this great tragic heroine

441
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:09,444
go beyond her time and place?
You have one hour.

442
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:19,281
Zahira.

443
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:23,842
You must come home.
Leave me alone.

444
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:29,570
<i>Your mother hasn't eaten since you left.</i>

445
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:32,049
<i>Stop.</i>

446
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:34,967
<i>You must stop.
You.</i>

447
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:37,370
<i>Aren't you ashamed?
Ashamed for us?</i>

448
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:42,765
<i>I'm telling you, Zahira.
Either you come home or you die.</i>

449
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,762
<i>Is that clear? Understand?</i>

450
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:47,726
Let go of her.

451
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:49,245
Hey, calm down.

452
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,764
Get off her.

453
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:57,363
What's going on here?
Stop this. Sir, who are you?

454
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,768
What got into him?
Nothing.

455
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:16,124
I'm going to call the police.
No, please don't.

456
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:19,284
Please don't?
Are you joking, Miss Kazim?

457
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:22,962
He won't do it again.
Won't he? I don't give a damn.

458
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:26,044
He needs to know that
people don't fight in the street here.

459
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:29,370
If he does it again,
then call the police.

460
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:31,204
But just give him a chance.

461
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,685
A chance?
Yes, a chance.

462
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:39,249
You can't understand.

463
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:43,764
I know it seems incredible,
but you can't understand.

464
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:47,445
Please, don't.

465
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:49,724
You can go back to class.

466
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:53,644
Go back to class, Miss Kazim.

467
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:55,370
What are you going to do?

468
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:59,130
Go to class right now
and it'll be better for everyone.

469
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:28,201
What's wrong?

470
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:33,008
Remember when I went for the abortion?

471
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:37,282
I didn't go through with it.

472
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:39,967
What?

473
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:45,681
What were you thinking?
I don't know.

474
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:51,727
But it's my baby.
I don't have the right to...

475
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:53,245
I really don't know.

476
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:57,803
Do you realise?
Yes.

477
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,331
Of course I do.

478
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:06,203
Can you still do it?
Not here.

479
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:13,243
But that's not the worst thing.
What is?

480
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:16,406
Now it has a soul.

481
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:21,731
It has a soul.

482
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:24,250
What are you talking about?

483
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:19,843
Where?

484
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:24,521
Below to your right.
At the bottom of the drawer.

485
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:44,011
What are you doing with that?
It was in there.

486
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:45,681
It's loaded.

487
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:48,329
What are you planning to do with that?

488
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:52,601
Nothing. It's the neighbourhood.
What do you mean?

489
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:55,885
It's dangerous nowadays.

490
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:58,725
Dangerous?
Yes. Dangerous.

491
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:01,360
Get the price tags.

492
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:25,330
It's André.

493
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:40,085
Zahira asked me to come.

494
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,161
I figured as much.

495
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:49,969
I'm listening.
Zahira wants to work it out.

496
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:52,004
So do we.

497
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:55,201
The important thing is,
she doesn't want to lose you.

498
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:58,325
She loves her family,
her brother and sisters.

499
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:00,610
She holds nothing against you.

500
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:04,250
She also says that
when you get angry, you scare her.

501
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:08,129
She never dares talk to you.
She never has.

502
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:10,966
She just wants this to be over.

503
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:13,090
She knows what to do.

504
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:18,126
She doesn't want
to marry someone she hasn't chosen.

505
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:23,042
<i>This discussion doesn't make any sense.</i>

506
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:29,560
This discussion is pointless, André.
Why?

507
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:33,721
Why?

508
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:36,524
I have a message for her, too.

509
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:40,163
Tell her that if she doesn't marry,
she'll lose everything.

510
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:41,521
Everything.

511
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:43,444
Her father, her mother,

512
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:46,849
her big sister,
her brother, her little sister.

513
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,650
Everything.

514
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:51,610
A Pakistani must marry a Pakistani.

515
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:55,004
That's how it is.

516
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:56,810
It's what everyone does.

517
00:54:57,240 --> 00:54:59,971
There are exceptions.
No.

518
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,048
No exceptions?
None that I know of.

519
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:06,244
Not even one in a thousand.
And it won't be my daughter.

520
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:08,801
But it's her life.
Her life.

521
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:12,249
Put yourself in her shoes.
You do that?

522
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,526
You put yourself in her shoes?
Can you do that?

523
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:18,970
That's impressive.
I just want things to work out.

524
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:21,767
I've watched Zahira grow up.

525
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,684
I've always known her.

526
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:26,525
I've seen all of your children grow up.

527
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:29,326
Zahira can't stay with you.
I don't agree to it.

528
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:32,211
She's always done it.
You've always agreed to it.

529
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:34,328
Not anymore.

530
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:38,886
But she'll come back home.
Of course she will.

531
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:43,769
She's over 18, she can do what she wants.
Over 18?

532
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:46,325
So what?

533
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:49,807
I don't know.
I understand how she's feeling.

534
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:54,690
That's your thing.
Understanding people.

535
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:58,804
You've got it all worked out.
You people know everything.

536
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,570
And we are just crazy, huh?

537
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:03,804
No, I never said that.
And that's not what I think.

538
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:06,562
See that street?

539
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:10,887
How many unmarried women
do you think live there?

540
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:14,079
How many?
I have no idea.

541
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:17,084
On that street alone,
there are at least fifteen.

542
00:56:17,085 --> 00:56:20,368
Fifteen unmarried women.
So?

543
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:24,399
That's more than
in the whole of Pakistan.

544
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,323
There are no single women in Pakistan.

545
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:29,611
Do you think they're happy here?

546
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:33,204
Don't you think they need a family?

547
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:34,646
What does that have to do with it?

548
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:38,766
I don't pester you
about your unmarried women.

549
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:41,611
They are unhappy.

550
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:44,570
I know them.
Some of them are customers.

551
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:48,971
Do what you like
with your unmarried women,

552
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:51,726
your values, your traditions,
your customs.

553
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:53,211
Do whatever you like.

554
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:58,090
But don't interfere with my daughter.
She's my daughter, not yours.

555
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:00,321
Got it?

556
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:04,885
Are you alright?

557
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:07,971
Are you alright?

558
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:11,728
I'm fine...
Dad, are you OK?

559
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:15,201
Some water.

560
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:30,409
You'd better go now, André.

561
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:32,851
It's for the best.

562
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:51,209
I knew it would be like this.

563
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:55,402
What about your mother?
We had more of a chance with my father.

564
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:57,525
She loves you.

565
00:57:57,680 --> 00:58:00,365
Of course she loves me.
What do you think?

566
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:04,643
My father loves me too. And I can't
tell you how much Amir loves me.

567
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:07,045
That's not the problem.

568
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:17,808
My father can't go back to Pakistan.

569
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:19,966
Why not?

570
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:24,650
If he promises his daughter's hand
but can't make her marry,

571
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:27,442
he'll be rejected
by the entire community.

572
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:31,762
He can't go back.
That's how it is.

573
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:34,249
Can't they just not give a damn?

574
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:37,125
No, they can't.

575
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:43,402
If you don't save face,
then it's death.

576
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:47,640
Lose your honour,
and you lose everything.

577
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:55,844
What are you going to do?

578
00:58:57,800 --> 00:58:58,847
I don't know.

579
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:02,125
I've got no idea.

580
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:23,879
What are you doing here?

581
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:26,008
Aurore's not here.
She's at her mother's.

582
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:27,681
Hello.

583
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:29,848
Yes, I know.
I saw her earlier.

584
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,401
Anyway, she's with Frank.
Really?

585
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:34,645
Why are you here, then?

586
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:38,081
I'm here because...

587
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:41,569
I realised that I'm not scared of death.

588
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:43,445
Is that so?

589
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:53,283
Doesn't it bother you leaving me out here?
No. I'm fine with it.

590
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:05,566
I'm hot.

591
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:07,688
I had a spare T-shirt but...

592
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:11,963
I'd like to wash my hands too.

593
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:20,010
Got everything you need?
Yes, don't worry.

594
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:22,004
Aurore has a really nice place.

595
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:24,771
You've never been here before?
No.

596
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:29,161
I'm coming out.
I'll go downstairs.

597
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:31,688
Don't worry, I'm dressed.

598
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,685
Aurore will be here in five minutes.

599
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:45,884
I asked her to come back.

600
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:48,205
OK. That's fine.

601
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:50,285
She's coming with Frank.

602
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:52,687
Fine.

603
01:00:57,400 --> 01:00:58,811
Did you see it?
Yes.

604
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:00,764
What?
A shooting star.

605
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:03,651
Seriously? Did you see it?
Yes.

606
01:01:04,680 --> 01:01:07,604
I missed it.
Shall we make a wish?

607
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:10,289
Can I do it if I didn't see it?
Sure.

608
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:13,000
I've never heard that rule.
Just chill.

609
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:14,764
I'll make a wish anyway.

610
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:17,607
Done.

611
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:19,767
Done.

612
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:21,247
Done.

613
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,128
Zahira?
Done too.

614
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:36,131
Aurore said you're leaving.
Yes.

615
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:39,808
For how long?
At least two years.

616
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:42,449
Australia, right?
Yes.

617
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:44,324
Two years in Australia?

618
01:01:44,520 --> 01:01:45,601
Why the sudden interest?

619
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:47,330
I'm not that interested.

620
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:55,883
Which city?
Sydney.

621
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:59,083
They say it's the most
beautiful city in the world.

622
01:01:59,084 --> 01:02:01,890
You're definitely going?
I signed the contact.

623
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:06,520
You're not scared of leaving?
I'm more scared of staying.

624
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:35,847
It can't be that bad, right?
What's wrong?

625
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:45,130
<i>My baby sister.</i>

626
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:52,840
I know why you're here.

627
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,970
I know.
I know that you know.

628
01:03:57,120 --> 01:04:00,044
Of course I do.
I'm in the right?

629
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:01,881
Of course.

630
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,331
But I don't want to.

631
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:12,800
I came to tell you that
I know how you're feeling.

632
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:15,330
It's normal.

633
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:17,841
You mustn't worry.

634
01:04:22,040 --> 01:04:23,166
Aurore?

635
01:04:23,720 --> 01:04:24,642
Hina.

636
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:27,648
It's been such a long time.
Yes.

637
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:29,529
How are you?
Fine. You?

638
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:31,205
Fine.
Can you stay?

639
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:33,442
I don't know yet.
It's all been a bit hectic.

640
01:04:34,360 --> 01:04:37,648
Looks like Barcelona agrees with you.
You see.

641
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:40,963
Have you seen your parents?
I saw them earlier. Amara too.

642
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:44,649
She looks wonderful.
Your family is full of beautiful girls.

643
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:47,410
I should go.

644
01:04:47,640 --> 01:04:49,210
See you later.
OK.

645
01:04:50,080 --> 01:04:52,003
See you later, I hope.
Me too.

646
01:04:58,280 --> 01:04:59,566
Don't look at me like that.

647
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:03,201
And remember,

648
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:06,002
all this,
everything that's being asked of you,

649
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:09,084
it seems difficult,
but not doing it would be worse.

650
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:11,203
Believe me, it'd be worse.

651
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:14,006
Look at Abbas.
You have no idea how much I love him.

652
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:16,205
At first, I didn't want to.

653
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:18,209
I really didn't, just like you.

654
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:21,043
But now...

655
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:24,170
The worst thing that could happen
would be to lose him.

656
01:05:29,320 --> 01:05:30,685
I...

657
01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:32,410
I heard that...

658
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:35,363
I have to have
my hymen reconstructed?

659
01:05:35,840 --> 01:05:37,251
That's nothing.

660
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:38,606
I had it done too.

661
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:41,322
Really?
Yes.

662
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:44,326
I didn't know.
You don't know everything.

663
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:46,568
Mum and Dad didn't know.

664
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:48,091
What?
No.

665
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:51,850
They never knew.
Could you imagine Abbas?

666
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:56,362
I'm happy you're telling me.

667
01:05:58,280 --> 01:05:59,884
But still, it's unfair.

668
01:06:00,840 --> 01:06:02,001
Unfair?

669
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:04,850
<i>Yes.</i>

670
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:08,002
Not just that, but the whole thing.

671
01:06:08,360 --> 01:06:11,119
Of course it's unfair.
We're women.

672
01:06:11,120 --> 01:06:12,281
What do you think?

673
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:15,444
But it's unfair.

674
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:20,089
Everything is unfair in life, Zahira.
Everything.

675
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:22,208
There are men
and there are women.

676
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:25,286
Handsome men,
beautiful women, ugly people.

677
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:27,522
The rich and the poor.

678
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:30,047
Healthy people,
the sick, the disabled.

679
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:33,363
Nothing is fair, ever.
It doesn't exist.

680
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:38,083
But if something's unfair,
you have to fight it.

681
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,571
You only fight
if you can change things.

682
01:06:43,720 --> 01:06:45,131
And if they're worth changing.

683
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:49,330
Otherwise, there's only one thing to do.
Accept.

684
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:53,404
If you can't see that,
you create unhappiness.

685
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:57,162
For everyone.
The whole family, but especially you.

686
01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:01,167
To what end?

687
01:07:03,080 --> 01:07:04,570
Would you be happy?

688
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:08,683
Without Amir? Without Amara?
Without me? Without seeing us again?

689
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,604
Can you imagine the shame'?

690
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:14,764
For Dad? For Mum'?

691
01:07:14,920 --> 01:07:16,524
The misery they'd feel?

692
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,162
Could you be happy like that?

693
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:31,205
I'm thinking of you.

694
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:34,450
I'm here for you.

695
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:37,810
For you.

696
01:07:41,080 --> 01:07:43,048
Hey, look at me.

697
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:45,401
I understand.

698
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:49,571
I understand completely.

699
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:06,290
Don't ever leave again.

700
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:07,646
I won't, promise.

701
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:13,768
Are you hurt?
It's nothing.

702
01:10:17,160 --> 01:10:21,688
<i>I marry you to Adnan Zaki,
son of Haider Zaki.</i>

703
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:26,721
<i>The dowry stands at two million rupees.</i>

704
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:29,771
<i>Do you accept this marriage?</i>

705
01:10:30,280 --> 01:10:31,406
<i>Yes, I accept.</i>

706
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:35,082
<i>I marry you to Adnan Zaki,
son of Haider Zaki.</i>

707
01:10:35,240 --> 01:10:38,767
<i>The dowry stands at two million rupees.</i>

708
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:44,082
<i>Do you accept this marriage?
Yes, I accept.</i>

709
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:57,564
<i>I marry you to Zahira Kazim,
daughter of Mansoor Kazim.</i>

710
01:10:57,760 --> 01:11:03,290
<i>The dowry stands at two million rupees.</i>

711
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:08,560
<i>Do you accept this marriage?
Yes, I accept.</i>

712
01:12:52,440 --> 01:12:53,646
This is my father.

713
01:12:56,160 --> 01:12:57,764
This is my mother.

714
01:13:00,680 --> 01:13:02,045
This is my sister.

715
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:03,965
<i>Zahira, congratulations.</i>

716
01:13:04,120 --> 01:13:05,645
And these are my cousins.

717
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,367
That's my family.

718
01:13:51,400 --> 01:13:53,004
Yes, it's done.

719
01:13:53,240 --> 01:13:57,211
The biggest mistake of my life.

720
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:12,001
It's always the same.

721
01:14:12,002 --> 01:14:14,970
I fly in with no luggage
and leave with a half a house.

722
01:14:17,720 --> 01:14:19,245
We'll see each other in a week.

723
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:20,970
You're coming back?
No.

724
01:14:22,360 --> 01:14:23,361
Weren't you told?

725
01:14:25,320 --> 01:14:27,129
I'm not going back to Barcelona.

726
01:14:29,720 --> 01:14:30,687
Where are you going?

727
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:34,171
I'm going to Islamabad,
then straight to the village.

728
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:35,765
I'll be there in two days.

729
01:14:36,600 --> 01:14:38,250
What will you do there?

730
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:41,006
I'll take care of the preparations.

731
01:14:41,400 --> 01:14:44,006
It's lot of work.
What preparations?

732
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,570
I thought you knew.

733
01:14:48,240 --> 01:14:51,289
For the ceremony.
Your wedding ceremony.

734
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:53,606
You knew this.

735
01:14:54,440 --> 01:14:55,680
There'll be 300 guests.

736
01:14:55,880 --> 01:14:59,771
We have a week to do everything.
It's not really enough.

737
01:15:01,360 --> 01:15:04,967
I didn't know.
You knew the wedding would be held there.

738
01:15:05,640 --> 01:15:09,611
It's more convenient for everyone.
It's better for you, and Adnan too.

739
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:12,570
I didn't know it'd be now.
That's how it is.

740
01:15:14,160 --> 01:15:15,321
OK, let's go.

741
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:20,287
Give Dad and Amara a kiss for me.

742
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:25,528
I'm happy it all worked out.

743
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:32,771
<i>Take care.</i>

744
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:43,726
Why didn't you tell me?
Why wasn't I told?

745
01:15:44,240 --> 01:15:45,526
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

746
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:47,531
The ceremony in Pakistan.

747
01:15:47,680 --> 01:15:49,045
<i>Zahira...</i>

748
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:51,248
<i>you knew it would be held there.</i>

749
01:15:51,640 --> 01:15:55,122
<i>I thought it would be later.</i>
<i>What difference does it make?</i>

750
01:15:58,120 --> 01:15:59,724
<i>I'm asking you.</i>

751
01:16:00,720 --> 01:16:02,290
<i>What difference does it make?</i>

752
01:16:03,560 --> 01:16:04,971
None.

753
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:15,569
<i>This is very important.</i>

754
01:16:16,240 --> 01:16:20,609
<i>She already knows.
She's known for a long time.</i>

755
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:25,209
<i>Are you sure?
Yes, certain.</i>

756
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:27,968
<i>Will she still make the trip?</i>

757
01:16:28,840 --> 01:16:31,446
<i>Yes.
She'll do it.</i>

758
01:16:31,640 --> 01:16:33,005
What are you doing?

759
01:16:34,680 --> 01:16:36,444
Nothing. Let's go to bed.

760
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:50,044
<i>We have to be at the airport
two hours in advance.</i>

761
01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:54,647
<i>Did I give you your passport?</i>
<i>No, you wanted to keep it.</i>

762
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:58,569
<i>You're</i> right.
<i>It's Amir who has his passport.</i>

763
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:04,643
Why is it only us two leaving?

764
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:07,087
<i>Your father has to stay
to watch the shop.</i>

765
01:17:07,360 --> 01:17:08,600
<i>He'll fly out next Sunday.</i>

766
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:10,962
<i>Amir and Amara will come with him.</i>

767
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:13,764
Why are we leaving early?

768
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:17,841
<i>There's much preparation to be done.
Don't worry.</i>

769
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:19,731
<i>We'll make it in time.</i>

770
01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:12,050
If I asked you to run away with me,
what would you do?

771
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:18,051
If I asked you to run away with me,
right now, what would you do?

772
01:18:22,040 --> 01:18:23,007
Shall we go?

773
01:19:28,840 --> 01:19:30,968
I won't go.
Don't come looking for me.

774
01:19:31,120 --> 01:19:32,326
Forgive me.

775
01:21:42,520 --> 01:21:43,965
<i>Mum?</i>

776
01:21:45,560 --> 01:21:47,244
<i>Everything will be fine.</i>

777
01:21:47,400 --> 01:21:49,679
<i>Don't worry.
What is it?</i>

778
01:21:49,680 --> 01:21:51,967
Dad had a bad turn.
<i>My</i> God.

779
01:21:52,360 --> 01:21:54,442
He's not going to die.
It'll be alright.

780
01:21:54,443 --> 01:21:57,171
Mum, it's going to be alright.

781
01:21:57,840 --> 01:21:59,729
<i>Everything will be alright, Mum.</i>

782
01:22:00,520 --> 01:22:01,885
He's not going to die.

783
01:22:02,600 --> 01:22:03,965
He's not going to die.

784
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:15,649
Is he OK?
Where are you?

785
01:22:16,240 --> 01:22:17,571
Tell me how he is.

786
01:22:18,440 --> 01:22:19,851
You have to come back.

787
01:22:22,920 --> 01:22:25,446
Seriously, how is he?

788
01:22:26,080 --> 01:22:27,241
He's fine.

789
01:22:28,600 --> 01:22:29,522
Fine.

790
01:22:30,760 --> 01:22:32,125
What about Mum and Amara?

791
01:22:33,560 --> 01:22:34,721
They're fine.

792
01:22:38,080 --> 01:22:39,969
You have to come back, Zahira.

793
01:22:44,080 --> 01:22:45,411
I have to go.

794
01:22:48,600 --> 01:22:49,567
Hello?

795
01:22:50,600 --> 01:22:51,761
Hello?

796
01:24:56,760 --> 01:24:57,727
How do you say neck?

797
01:25:01,160 --> 01:25:02,400
And ears?

798
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:28,567
And lips?

799
01:25:37,040 --> 01:25:38,644
I know how to say something.

800
01:25:39,560 --> 01:25:42,769
Go on.
I've wanted to say this for a long time.

801
01:25:48,840 --> 01:25:51,650
Where did you learn that?
I did some research.

802
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:55,604
OK, but I would say:

803
01:25:57,880 --> 01:26:01,566
Is that "I don't love you"?
No. It's what a girl says.

804
01:26:01,567 --> 01:26:04,131
What do you mean?
Girls say that.

805
01:26:04,320 --> 01:26:06,891
But I won't say it to you.
Why not?

806
01:26:07,080 --> 01:26:09,321
Because I won't.

807
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:52,368
Found your papers.
Come 10 a.m. tomorrow. Amara.

808
01:26:52,600 --> 01:26:54,443
Will you be alone?

809
01:26:54,680 --> 01:26:57,286
Yes. If anything changes,
I'll tell you. Miss you.

810
01:26:59,280 --> 01:27:01,886
Miss you too.

811
01:27:03,120 --> 01:27:05,122
See you tomorrow.

812
01:27:13,360 --> 01:27:15,283
Red envelopes, red paper...

813
01:27:15,440 --> 01:27:18,330
A love letter?
That's all I could find.

814
01:27:18,520 --> 01:27:21,285
Can I read it?
It's a love letter, so no.

815
01:27:57,080 --> 01:27:58,241
How is he?

816
01:27:58,840 --> 01:28:01,002
He's fine.
We had a fright, but he's OK.

817
01:28:01,520 --> 01:28:03,079
That's good.

818
01:28:03,080 --> 01:28:05,082
It's that syndrome...
Brugada syndrome.

819
01:28:05,240 --> 01:28:06,401
Nasty business.

820
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:09,170
You shouldn't worry.

821
01:28:09,320 --> 01:28:12,529
It was a close call,
but he should be fine now.

822
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:15,365
Is your mother OK?
Yes.

823
01:28:15,560 --> 01:28:17,608
Your sisters?
Everyone's fine.

824
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:19,125
Really, everything's fine.

825
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:27,525
What do you know?

826
01:28:28,280 --> 01:28:30,851
I know everything's OK.
Zahira is fine.

827
01:28:31,640 --> 01:28:33,404
Do you...
That's all I know.

828
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:34,761
Nothing more.

829
01:28:37,280 --> 01:28:40,363
Can I help at all?
No, I don't think so.

830
01:28:43,280 --> 01:28:45,009
What can I do?

831
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:51,847
I don't know.

832
01:28:53,880 --> 01:28:55,689
Tell me what to do.

833
01:28:57,600 --> 01:28:59,284
I honestly don't know.

834
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:03,082
What can I do?
Nothing at all.

835
01:30:37,920 --> 01:30:40,651
I missed you.
I missed you too.

836
01:30:44,280 --> 01:30:45,520
I'm sorry.

837
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:47,683
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

838
01:30:48,360 --> 01:30:49,771
What's wrong?

839
01:30:54,400 --> 01:30:56,721
I can't stay.
Wait, Zahira. This is serious.

840
01:30:57,560 --> 01:30:59,722
I know it's serious.
I know everything.

841
01:30:59,880 --> 01:31:01,325
You don't know everything.

842
01:31:02,160 --> 01:31:03,571
For us, it's over.

843
01:31:04,760 --> 01:31:05,966
It's over.

844
01:31:06,400 --> 01:31:09,688
For Dad, Mum...
I know.

845
01:31:11,400 --> 01:31:14,051
Amara, Hina...
I know.

846
01:31:14,200 --> 01:31:15,611
Me too.
I know.

847
01:31:15,760 --> 01:31:17,046
Me, Zahira.

848
01:31:19,800 --> 01:31:21,962
If you know,
why are you doing it?

849
01:31:25,280 --> 01:31:26,441
I'm leaving.

850
01:31:30,840 --> 01:31:31,966
Zahka.

851
01:31:43,560 --> 01:31:44,971
You're my baby sister.

852
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:56,202
Dear Amir,
I've decided to leave.

853
01:32:56,360 --> 01:32:57,964
I can't tell you where,

854
01:32:58,120 --> 01:33:00,646
but I promise that
I'll keep you up-to-date.

855
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:03,246
Time can heal everything.

856
01:33:03,440 --> 01:33:05,283
We have to wait.

857
01:33:05,440 --> 01:33:07,522
I hope Dad will get better.

858
01:33:07,680 --> 01:33:11,810
Give Mum a kiss from me,
and one for Hina and Amara.

859
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,571
She can have my teddy bears
and my toiletries.

860
01:33:15,200 --> 01:33:17,328
I'm going to miss you all very much.

861
01:33:17,520 --> 01:33:19,409
I love you all. I love you.

862
01:33:20,160 --> 01:33:21,650
Zahka.
