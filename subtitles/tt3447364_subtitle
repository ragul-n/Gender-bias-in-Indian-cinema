1
00:02:19,501 --> 00:02:24,292
November, 1942, Calcutta

2
00:02:25,626 --> 00:02:27,501
A world war was on

3
00:02:29,001 --> 00:02:34,292
The Japanese army was at the
Burma border aiming for Calcutta

4
00:02:36,167 --> 00:02:37,751
We, the Calcuttans...

5
00:02:38,292 --> 00:02:42,042
...were caught between our British
overlords and the Jap invaders

6
00:03:37,667 --> 00:03:38,667
Are you deaf?

7
00:03:45,376 --> 00:03:49,292
You understand only one language

8
00:04:00,876 --> 00:04:01,917
Watch out!

9
00:04:22,167 --> 00:04:23,167
You...

10
00:04:24,417 --> 00:04:27,042
A message for Shanghai

11
00:04:27,626 --> 00:04:30,542
I'm taking what's mine

12
00:05:41,167 --> 00:05:42,417
Last table

13
00:05:49,042 --> 00:05:51,792
Whenever he talks, you feel like
smashing his teeth in

14
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:10,876
I don't care if Gandhi stays in jail

15
00:06:11,417 --> 00:06:12,792
I never donate

16
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:18,292
I'm not asking for charity. I need
some help

17
00:06:18,667 --> 00:06:21,042
I don't help either.
Who sent you?

18
00:06:24,626 --> 00:06:25,876
What happened?

19
00:06:26,667 --> 00:06:29,417
My father's been missing
for two months

20
00:06:30,542 --> 00:06:33,292
So, why are you here?
Report it to the police

21
00:06:33,626 --> 00:06:37,001
- I did
- So Daddy is not a big shot?

22
00:06:38,001 --> 00:06:39,251
Morgue? Hospitals?

23
00:06:39,917 --> 00:06:41,917
Maybe he came under a tram

24
00:06:42,542 --> 00:06:44,667
I've looked everywhere.
Hospitals, morgues

25
00:06:45,126 --> 00:06:47,167
- I want your opinion
- Forget it

26
00:06:48,876 --> 00:06:51,251
Forget it. That's my advice.
Go

27
00:06:52,876 --> 00:06:54,667
- But he's my father
- Sure

28
00:06:55,667 --> 00:06:59,292
a) Maybe he was kidnapped. But
no one asked for a ransom

29
00:06:59,667 --> 00:07:02,042
Or you'd be asking for money,
not advice

30
00:07:02,417 --> 00:07:05,751
b) He was murdered,
corpse hidden

31
00:07:06,167 --> 00:07:08,626
Got caught in a shady deal.
Came to a bad end

32
00:07:09,001 --> 00:07:11,542
c) He's alive. On the run.
Involved in a shady deal

33
00:07:11,917 --> 00:07:13,667
d) He's run away with a woman

34
00:07:49,626 --> 00:07:52,417
Leela, I have spoken to Prof. Bose

35
00:07:54,417 --> 00:07:56,792
He wants me to apply for the maths
lecturer's job

36
00:07:57,626 --> 00:08:00,001
I'll get it. I'll become a lecturer

37
00:08:00,376 --> 00:08:01,751
That's what worried you

38
00:08:03,376 --> 00:08:06,042
No money, no job, no inheritance

39
00:08:06,917 --> 00:08:08,542
There's your insurance

40
00:08:14,042 --> 00:08:15,167
What are you hiding?

41
00:08:16,917 --> 00:08:18,251
Let me see

42
00:08:25,167 --> 00:08:26,917
Whose marriage invite?

43
00:08:43,542 --> 00:08:47,417
You're marrying Atanu Sen? The
Chemistry gold medalist?

44
00:08:48,042 --> 00:08:50,542
The guy with the great job
at Hind Chemics?

45
00:08:54,417 --> 00:08:56,792
"Atanu weds Leela"

46
00:09:36,167 --> 00:09:37,287
You didn't tell me your name

47
00:09:38,417 --> 00:09:39,417
You didn't ask

48
00:09:42,251 --> 00:09:43,251
Ajit Banerjee

49
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:45,042
I know

50
00:09:46,667 --> 00:09:48,126
Everyone knows you

51
00:09:50,126 --> 00:09:53,042
Did your father leave
some money behind?

52
00:09:53,417 --> 00:09:54,167
Why?

53
00:09:54,417 --> 00:09:58,167
That would tell us if he ran
or planned to go

54
00:10:00,542 --> 00:10:02,917
- I need to examine his box
- You have it?

55
00:10:03,167 --> 00:10:03,667
Yes

56
00:10:04,001 --> 00:10:05,542
- Can I see it?
- No

57
00:10:12,626 --> 00:10:13,917
No cash here

58
00:10:15,417 --> 00:10:16,917
Any other belongings?

59
00:10:17,417 --> 00:10:18,417
No

60
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,417
Was he a chemist?

61
00:10:23,251 --> 00:10:25,042
Calcutta University

62
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:28,376
Gold medalist. 1920

63
00:10:33,042 --> 00:10:35,126
War bonds worth 10,000

64
00:10:35,667 --> 00:10:38,292
In Kamalbala Devi's name.
Who is she?

65
00:10:39,501 --> 00:10:40,501
My mother

66
00:10:41,542 --> 00:10:43,167
She lives in the village

67
00:10:48,667 --> 00:10:51,126
- ls your father diabetic?
- Yes

68
00:10:53,751 --> 00:10:56,417
- Likes chewing betel leaf?
- Likes? He's addicted to paan

69
00:10:57,001 --> 00:11:00,126
- Made his own mix
- Where's his paan box?

70
00:11:02,042 --> 00:11:03,876
Didn't see it at the lodge

71
00:11:19,292 --> 00:11:21,001
What does he do?

72
00:11:22,542 --> 00:11:23,542
Not much

73
00:11:24,292 --> 00:11:26,167
Doesn't have a regularjob

74
00:11:28,542 --> 00:11:29,667
I have no idea

75
00:11:30,292 --> 00:11:32,751
We didn't talk much

76
00:11:33,917 --> 00:11:35,042
I mean we don't

77
00:11:39,626 --> 00:11:41,167
But he pays your bills

78
00:11:45,667 --> 00:11:48,501
Either you've kidnapped
your own father...

79
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:50,917
...or you're playacting with me

80
00:11:51,251 --> 00:11:53,251
- Or something is fishy
- Meaning?

81
00:11:55,667 --> 00:12:00,042
A man with no steady job pays for
his son's room, fancy cigarettes

82
00:12:00,417 --> 00:12:04,376
Buys bonds for his second wife.
You failed to mention that

83
00:12:04,626 --> 00:12:05,751
How did you know?

84
00:12:06,042 --> 00:12:08,251
It's on the bonds.
Kamalbala, aged 24

85
00:12:14,042 --> 00:12:17,917
A newly married man doesn't leave
his second wife for another woman

86
00:12:18,542 --> 00:12:21,251
Option D is out. Don't hide
facts from me

87
00:12:22,542 --> 00:12:24,917
The insulin and the paan box.
Something's fishy

88
00:12:25,292 --> 00:12:26,792
Why fishy?

89
00:12:27,417 --> 00:12:29,876
Maybe he just went away
somewhere

90
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:33,542
Nothing "just" happens
in this world

91
00:12:34,501 --> 00:12:36,167
Look, it's no big deal for me

92
00:12:36,501 --> 00:12:39,292
Two days at the lodge
and I'll figure it all out

93
00:12:39,667 --> 00:12:42,167
Your father could be alive
and innocent

94
00:12:43,542 --> 00:12:45,167
Or dead and guilty

95
00:12:52,042 --> 00:12:53,792
Shall I go?

96
00:12:56,751 --> 00:12:57,751
Find out for you?

97
00:16:39,042 --> 00:16:40,542
Watch out, mister!

98
00:16:51,417 --> 00:16:52,417
Come here!

99
00:16:53,417 --> 00:16:55,292
0k! Hold his legs down

100
00:17:05,626 --> 00:17:08,042
He was shouting "Free Bengal"
slogans at College Square

101
00:17:08,792 --> 00:17:11,751
The police love thrashing students
like him

102
00:17:12,042 --> 00:17:13,042
Let me see

103
00:17:14,917 --> 00:17:16,251
Your pulse

104
00:17:16,667 --> 00:17:18,001
I'm fine

105
00:17:19,667 --> 00:17:21,042
Doesn't look like it

106
00:17:21,751 --> 00:17:24,917
I saw the vacancy sign outside.
I need a room

107
00:17:26,001 --> 00:17:28,667
- Your name?
- Atul Chakravarti

108
00:17:30,292 --> 00:17:33,667
I'm looking for work. First time
in Calcutta

109
00:17:35,251 --> 00:17:36,251
From?

110
00:17:36,667 --> 00:17:38,751
Munger. Just got off the train

111
00:17:39,251 --> 00:17:40,876
Someone at the station said...

112
00:17:41,042 --> 00:17:42,917
...your lodge is the cheapest
and the best

113
00:17:45,751 --> 00:17:46,751
Go!

114
00:17:47,917 --> 00:17:50,001
If you skip class again...

115
00:17:50,167 --> 00:17:51,417
...I'll break your other leg

116
00:17:58,126 --> 00:18:00,667
- You're the manager?
- No rooms free

117
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:06,542
I don't understand

118
00:18:07,251 --> 00:18:09,792
No vacancies for liars

119
00:18:11,542 --> 00:18:12,542
Liars?

120
00:18:14,542 --> 00:18:15,542
Mr. Atul

121
00:18:17,667 --> 00:18:19,667
So this is your first visit
to Calcutta?

122
00:18:21,001 --> 00:18:23,126
Yet you wear second-hand shoes...

123
00:18:24,292 --> 00:18:27,751
...sold only at Ghosh's
on College Street

124
00:18:30,792 --> 00:18:33,042
The Munger train arrives
early morning

125
00:18:34,667 --> 00:18:37,751
If you came here directly,
you'd be here hours ago

126
00:18:39,001 --> 00:18:41,042
So many lies for one room?

127
00:18:43,667 --> 00:18:46,417
We rent to decent folk. Sorry

128
00:18:48,542 --> 00:18:49,542
Your hand

129
00:18:51,167 --> 00:18:52,542
Give me your hand

130
00:18:56,126 --> 00:18:57,126
Bakshy

131
00:18:58,042 --> 00:18:59,542
Byomkesh Bakshy

132
00:19:00,667 --> 00:19:02,001
Dr. Guha

133
00:19:03,001 --> 00:19:04,001
Anukul Guha

134
00:19:06,042 --> 00:19:07,167
Most impressive!

135
00:19:08,292 --> 00:19:09,376
Who is he?

136
00:19:11,251 --> 00:19:12,251
A detective?

137
00:19:13,167 --> 00:19:14,167
Not at all

138
00:19:15,292 --> 00:19:19,667
This is Praffula Rai.
An insurance agent

139
00:19:20,542 --> 00:19:22,417
He's away half the month

140
00:19:23,292 --> 00:19:25,376
He was away the night
Bhuvan vanished

141
00:19:25,667 --> 00:19:27,667
Travelled without a ticket.
So no proof

142
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:30,542
This is Mr. Ashwini

143
00:19:34,126 --> 00:19:35,917
I saw the New Howrah Bridge

144
00:19:36,792 --> 00:19:37,876
Stunning!

145
00:19:38,751 --> 00:19:40,001
Mr. Kanai

146
00:19:41,376 --> 00:19:44,417
He works close by. In Chinatown

147
00:19:48,042 --> 00:19:50,667
This is Mr. Byomkesh Bakshy

148
00:19:51,251 --> 00:19:53,876
He has some questions
concerning Mr. Bhuvan

149
00:19:54,292 --> 00:19:55,626
I'm trying to help

150
00:19:56,042 --> 00:19:57,042
Police?

151
00:19:58,126 --> 00:20:00,792
- Not at all
- What kind of questions?

152
00:20:02,542 --> 00:20:04,167
The nosy kind

153
00:20:05,667 --> 00:20:08,417
The kind that concerns
Mr. Bhuvan's paan box

154
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:12,751
You all right, Mr. Ashwini?
Some water

155
00:20:15,126 --> 00:20:18,626
You think we hid him in his
paan box?

156
00:20:19,001 --> 00:20:21,542
I think someone murdered him
and hid his body

157
00:20:29,251 --> 00:20:30,876
Fried potatoes?

158
00:20:31,417 --> 00:20:34,417
Only on Mondays, Wednesdays,
Fridays

159
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:36,667
Air raid!

160
00:20:49,542 --> 00:20:51,167
Quite an entrance!

161
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:53,792
Do you know Ching Ling?

162
00:20:54,542 --> 00:20:56,376
- Who?
- Never mind

163
00:20:56,917 --> 00:21:00,876
- What brings you...
- Is your name really Kanai?

164
00:21:03,417 --> 00:21:06,292
My Chinese name makes
the Bengali tongue twist

165
00:21:06,751 --> 00:21:08,001
So I changed it

166
00:21:09,292 --> 00:21:11,792
A plane has been shot down.
It's in flames

167
00:21:12,876 --> 00:21:15,417
- What do you do?
- I sell opium

168
00:21:17,417 --> 00:21:20,167
Not what you're thinking.
I have a license

169
00:21:20,917 --> 00:21:22,792
You should come to Chinatown

170
00:21:25,292 --> 00:21:28,042
Put this between your teeth

171
00:21:28,667 --> 00:21:31,542
You could bite your tongue
if a bomb goes off nearby

172
00:21:37,292 --> 00:21:38,292
And you?

173
00:21:39,001 --> 00:21:41,626
No, it tastes awful

174
00:21:44,667 --> 00:21:45,667
I agree

175
00:21:47,376 --> 00:21:50,417
I didn't manage to talk
to the man in the helmet

176
00:21:51,001 --> 00:21:52,292
Mr. Ashwini?

177
00:21:53,167 --> 00:21:56,376
He's Bhuvan's roommate.
I mean he was

178
00:22:01,917 --> 00:22:02,917
Mr. Ashwini

179
00:22:11,001 --> 00:22:12,542
That was quite a meal

180
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:16,667
Cigarette?

181
00:22:18,542 --> 00:22:20,251
Ah! You prefer paan

182
00:22:22,667 --> 00:22:24,042
Let's have one then

183
00:22:25,042 --> 00:22:26,042
Paan?

184
00:22:28,251 --> 00:22:30,167
No paan

185
00:22:30,667 --> 00:22:33,417
Weren't you and Bhuvan paan lovers?
You don't have any?

186
00:22:37,667 --> 00:22:38,667
No

187
00:22:39,667 --> 00:22:40,667
What's in there?

188
00:22:42,251 --> 00:22:43,251
In there?

189
00:22:45,792 --> 00:22:47,667
- The window...
- No, in the cupboard

190
00:22:50,126 --> 00:22:52,417
- What are you hiding there?
- Nothing

191
00:22:55,251 --> 00:22:56,667
It's empty

192
00:22:59,376 --> 00:23:01,042
I was going to return it

193
00:23:02,792 --> 00:23:04,792
I was about to...

194
00:23:06,626 --> 00:23:07,917
I did nothing wrong

195
00:23:08,667 --> 00:23:10,376
I'm a chief accountant

196
00:23:12,292 --> 00:23:13,542
I'm innocent

197
00:23:19,667 --> 00:23:21,001
He was murdered

198
00:23:21,751 --> 00:23:22,917
I'm not a murderer!

199
00:23:23,251 --> 00:23:26,251
Right. You're an accountant.
Now let me think

200
00:23:31,667 --> 00:23:35,667
Bhuvan left behind his paan box,
money and medicine

201
00:23:36,417 --> 00:23:38,626
He aimed to return the same night

202
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:41,126
That was two months ago

203
00:23:43,292 --> 00:23:45,167
Tell me about that night

204
00:23:45,792 --> 00:23:47,792
I went for a walk after dinner

205
00:23:48,167 --> 00:23:50,751
He wasn't here when I came back

206
00:23:51,126 --> 00:23:54,042
I went to sleep. Mr. Bhuvan
wasn't here the next morning

207
00:23:54,417 --> 00:23:58,292
I left for work. When I came back,
he wasn't here

208
00:23:59,917 --> 00:24:02,667
When I came back...

209
00:24:03,667 --> 00:24:05,667
You stole the paan box

210
00:24:07,167 --> 00:24:10,042
I loved his paan mix,
so I kept the box

211
00:24:10,667 --> 00:24:12,376
What work did he do?

212
00:24:12,751 --> 00:24:16,167
He used to say: "I'm a freelance
genius"

213
00:24:17,667 --> 00:24:19,792
Paid the rent on time

214
00:24:21,542 --> 00:24:26,001
Sometimes he'd come back late.
But never caused any trouble

215
00:24:32,167 --> 00:24:34,751
If what you say is true...

216
00:24:36,626 --> 00:24:39,292
...we should inform the police

217
00:24:39,792 --> 00:24:43,042
It could be murder, Doctor.
What could the police do?

218
00:24:52,292 --> 00:24:55,042
Luckily I knew the station chief

219
00:24:55,542 --> 00:24:59,417
Or we'd be in the lock-up. I mean
a paan box and murder

220
00:25:00,042 --> 00:25:01,167
Sorry for the bother, Ajit

221
00:25:01,376 --> 00:25:03,292
If Bhuvan was murdered...

222
00:25:04,001 --> 00:25:05,292
...and he was

223
00:25:06,001 --> 00:25:08,001
His corpse must be hidden
somewhere

224
00:25:08,667 --> 00:25:11,667
You'll believe me when I find
his corpse

225
00:25:13,167 --> 00:25:14,751
Are you crazy?

226
00:25:15,792 --> 00:25:18,917
I found this bus ticket in your
father's book

227
00:25:19,542 --> 00:25:22,042
Bus 32A. Stops right outside

228
00:25:22,667 --> 00:25:24,792
He got off somewhere
at the end of the line

229
00:25:25,042 --> 00:25:26,042
Look

230
00:25:26,917 --> 00:25:29,167
The conductor's punch mark.
I could...

231
00:25:29,417 --> 00:25:30,917
You could what?

232
00:25:36,001 --> 00:25:38,001
What did Bhuvan call himself?

233
00:25:38,751 --> 00:25:41,792
A freelance genius.
A genius chemist

234
00:25:42,626 --> 00:25:46,042
He may have worked in a chemical
factory. I could find...

235
00:25:46,376 --> 00:25:47,626
Find what?

236
00:25:48,167 --> 00:25:49,667
My father's corpse?

237
00:25:52,292 --> 00:25:53,292
Listen

238
00:25:55,751 --> 00:25:59,667
The police chief says he's missing.
Why do you want him dead?

239
00:26:00,751 --> 00:26:02,251
Case closed. Let's go

240
00:26:09,001 --> 00:26:10,167
Mr. Bakshy

241
00:26:11,292 --> 00:26:15,126
How did you know where
Ashwini had hidden...

242
00:26:15,542 --> 00:26:17,376
...the paan box?

243
00:26:21,126 --> 00:26:24,917
Easy. People can't help thinking
about what they're hiding

244
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:28,167
When I mentioned the paan box,
he left the table

245
00:26:28,876 --> 00:26:31,667
I pushed him around a bit.
Watched his eyes

246
00:26:32,126 --> 00:26:33,667
He gave himself away

247
00:26:35,292 --> 00:26:36,292
Simple

248
00:26:37,667 --> 00:26:41,917
If only I could learn to think
like you

249
00:26:46,126 --> 00:26:48,876
Many talkers in this world.
Few doers

250
00:26:49,292 --> 00:26:51,667
You look like a doer

251
00:26:53,917 --> 00:26:56,667
If you need help, you can count
on me

252
00:26:58,042 --> 00:27:00,167
There's a room in my lodge for you

253
00:27:01,792 --> 00:27:03,042
It's your call

254
00:27:07,251 --> 00:27:10,167
Going somewhere, mister?
Taxi?

255
00:29:14,292 --> 00:29:17,792
Let him watch, Ruby.
Maybe he enjoys watching

256
00:29:45,542 --> 00:29:47,042
Ruby, ask him...

257
00:29:47,542 --> 00:29:50,501
...how he got in here. It's private
property

258
00:29:52,417 --> 00:29:54,042
"No trespassing" sign here

259
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:57,376
ls there a sign outside his bedroom?

260
00:30:00,876 --> 00:30:03,542
Could I just walk in
without asking?

261
00:30:04,251 --> 00:30:06,001
I'm sorry. I didn't know

262
00:30:09,001 --> 00:30:10,001
Finally...

263
00:30:13,376 --> 00:30:14,417
...he apologises

264
00:30:17,001 --> 00:30:18,542
Who does that...

265
00:30:22,917 --> 00:30:24,542
Are you the owner?

266
00:30:29,167 --> 00:30:30,751
I own nothing

267
00:30:32,001 --> 00:30:33,542
Do you know the owner?

268
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:38,626
Or are you trespassing, too?

269
00:30:45,751 --> 00:30:48,292
You really don't recognise me?

270
00:30:51,292 --> 00:30:52,292
Madam!

271
00:30:54,042 --> 00:30:55,042
Coconuts for you

272
00:30:55,251 --> 00:30:56,876
Put them in the car

273
00:30:58,626 --> 00:31:00,917
Mr. Sikdaar owns this property

274
00:31:02,001 --> 00:31:03,376
I know him

275
00:31:04,126 --> 00:31:05,667
Do you know Bhuvan Banerjee?

276
00:31:11,251 --> 00:31:12,251
Who?

277
00:31:24,042 --> 00:31:25,417
Thank you for the lift

278
00:31:29,917 --> 00:31:31,417
Are you Mrs. Sikdaar?

279
00:31:34,626 --> 00:31:35,917
Anguri Devi?

280
00:31:36,751 --> 00:31:38,542
Are you from Rangoon?

281
00:31:43,542 --> 00:31:45,001
Where can I find Mr. Sikdaar?

282
00:31:45,251 --> 00:31:48,001
You have a talent for being rude,
but must you be nosy too?

283
00:31:49,917 --> 00:31:53,542
Mr. Bhuvan is missing. I need to
ask Mr. Sikdaar some questions

284
00:31:53,917 --> 00:31:55,167
Where is he?

285
00:31:59,501 --> 00:32:01,667
- Who are you?
- Byomkesh Bakshy

286
00:32:02,251 --> 00:32:03,626
What do you mean...

287
00:32:04,542 --> 00:32:05,917
... "missing"?

288
00:32:06,876 --> 00:32:10,376
He left his lodgings on 29 November

289
00:32:11,251 --> 00:32:13,042
But never came back

290
00:32:15,376 --> 00:32:17,042
That was two months ago

291
00:32:21,542 --> 00:32:23,751
I don't know any Mr. Bhuvan

292
00:32:24,126 --> 00:32:27,667
I thought you were a fan of mine.
Or a Party member...

293
00:32:28,042 --> 00:32:29,376
Party?

294
00:32:30,917 --> 00:32:32,792
What world do you live in?

295
00:32:33,876 --> 00:32:37,917
Gajanan Sikdaar? The Council Member?
Forever Bengal Party

296
00:32:38,417 --> 00:32:40,376
Is this his factory?

297
00:32:57,667 --> 00:33:00,917
She asked you to wait in her
make-up room

298
00:34:08,667 --> 00:34:10,792
Gajanan Sikdaar

299
00:34:11,667 --> 00:34:13,042
Council Member?

300
00:34:16,292 --> 00:34:19,542
"I know what you're up to

301
00:34:19,917 --> 00:34:22,501
"You had better see me or
everyone will know

302
00:34:22,917 --> 00:34:27,417
"Last chance. Tonight at
the factory at 9"

303
00:34:27,792 --> 00:34:29,001
What do you think?

304
00:34:30,417 --> 00:34:32,792
Was someone trying to scare Sikdaar?

305
00:34:33,042 --> 00:34:34,917
Not scare. Blackmail

306
00:34:35,542 --> 00:34:36,626
What else?

307
00:34:39,667 --> 00:34:42,126
The letters are cut out
from a newspaper

308
00:34:43,917 --> 00:34:45,417
Look at the post office stamp

309
00:34:48,001 --> 00:34:49,167
Chitpur Road

310
00:34:49,626 --> 00:34:51,542
That's our post office

311
00:34:51,917 --> 00:34:54,626
First letter 22 November, first post

312
00:34:55,001 --> 00:34:56,042
The second letter

313
00:34:56,667 --> 00:34:58,376
29 November. Same time

314
00:34:58,917 --> 00:35:00,292
What happened that day?

315
00:35:01,917 --> 00:35:04,001
That's the night Bhuvan vanished

316
00:35:05,001 --> 00:35:08,292
- What newspapers do you get here?
- They all buy their own

317
00:35:08,917 --> 00:35:12,417
- I read Basumati, Yugantar
- English newspapers?

318
00:35:14,042 --> 00:35:15,792
- The Statesman
- Who buys it?

319
00:35:16,042 --> 00:35:17,042
Bought it

320
00:35:21,001 --> 00:35:22,042
Puntiram

321
00:35:22,667 --> 00:35:25,501
Can't you keep the rubbish in order?

322
00:35:27,042 --> 00:35:29,501
Here! English newspapers

323
00:35:32,917 --> 00:35:34,001
December

324
00:35:36,001 --> 00:35:37,001
November

325
00:36:01,626 --> 00:36:06,042
- This means Mr. Bhuvan...
- ...was blackmailing Sikdaar

326
00:36:06,667 --> 00:36:08,417
The second letter is dated
29 November

327
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:11,917
Asking Sikdaar to meet at
the factory at 9

328
00:36:12,417 --> 00:36:14,792
Bhuvan left here at 8 and...

329
00:36:15,501 --> 00:36:17,042
...never came back

330
00:36:19,417 --> 00:36:20,626
I must meet Sikdaar

331
00:36:22,917 --> 00:36:26,917
My uncle Gajanan Sikdaar has only
one concern - his own skin

332
00:36:27,542 --> 00:36:29,376
We don't want him

333
00:36:29,667 --> 00:36:32,792
Or his Party. A leader must
show the way

334
00:36:33,167 --> 00:36:35,917
Our New Bengal Party will show
the way now

335
00:36:36,667 --> 00:36:39,001
Freedom is our right.
We will seize it

336
00:36:39,667 --> 00:36:41,042
We'll pay with our blood

337
00:36:41,792 --> 00:36:43,001
Hail Bengal!

338
00:36:48,626 --> 00:36:52,501
Participants in the Spring Day Action,
register now

339
00:36:54,042 --> 00:36:55,542
Aren't you the new boarder?

340
00:36:55,917 --> 00:36:57,251
You dressed my wound, remember?

341
00:36:57,542 --> 00:36:59,001
Who was that?

342
00:36:59,917 --> 00:37:02,417
Sukumar Ghosh... Sikdaar's nephew

343
00:37:05,001 --> 00:37:07,001
Where is Gajanan Sikdaar?

344
00:37:07,501 --> 00:37:10,792
Hiding. His nephewjust split
his Party

345
00:37:15,542 --> 00:37:19,876
Special Branch is snooping around.
I had better warn Sukumar

346
00:37:27,292 --> 00:37:28,751
I'm from Headquarters

347
00:37:29,876 --> 00:37:32,542
- Special Branch. And you?
- The local station

348
00:37:33,001 --> 00:37:34,001
ID?

349
00:37:36,042 --> 00:37:39,542
- Why are you here?
- We're Mr.Sikdaar's bodyguards

350
00:37:40,626 --> 00:37:41,626
Why?

351
00:37:42,042 --> 00:37:43,751
Someone is after his life

352
00:37:46,126 --> 00:37:50,251
I must question him. Wait outside.
Don't let any idiot in

353
00:37:56,917 --> 00:38:01,376
Sukumar, you're making a mistake.
You'll regret it

354
00:38:02,001 --> 00:38:05,251
You're saying that because
he's backing my Party

355
00:38:05,667 --> 00:38:09,292
Fool! You don't know him.
I do

356
00:38:09,667 --> 00:38:12,126
Uncle, say what you want.
It's too late

357
00:38:12,417 --> 00:38:14,292
We're celebrating Spring Day

358
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:16,792
Fool. He's using you

359
00:38:19,792 --> 00:38:21,042
Are you here to register?

360
00:38:23,792 --> 00:38:26,292
Registration for the new Party
is outside

361
00:38:27,417 --> 00:38:29,376
I'm here to see Sikdaar

362
00:38:31,001 --> 00:38:32,417
Have you an appointment?

363
00:38:33,542 --> 00:38:34,542
Why?

364
00:38:37,417 --> 00:38:39,001
Are you his secretary?

365
00:38:40,376 --> 00:38:41,376
No

366
00:38:44,501 --> 00:38:45,917
My name is Byomkesh Bakshy

367
00:38:46,917 --> 00:38:47,917
So?

368
00:38:49,667 --> 00:38:52,667
I want to question him
about a murder

369
00:38:54,417 --> 00:38:55,777
- Whose murder?
- Bhuvan Banerjee's

370
00:38:55,917 --> 00:38:57,626
He worked at Mr. Sikdaar's factory

371
00:38:58,042 --> 00:38:59,626
- You knew him?
- Who are you?

372
00:38:59,792 --> 00:39:01,667
I told you. Don't have time
to waste

373
00:39:01,876 --> 00:39:02,917
Nibaran!

374
00:39:03,917 --> 00:39:06,001
Try to stop us and we'll kill you

375
00:39:08,126 --> 00:39:10,001
Who's here from Special Branch?

376
00:39:10,792 --> 00:39:12,917
- I'm warning you
- Gajanan Sikdaar?

377
00:39:15,792 --> 00:39:18,251
- What's all this?
- Do you know Bhuvan Banerjee?

378
00:39:19,376 --> 00:39:21,292
- Go inside
- Why?

379
00:39:21,626 --> 00:39:24,376
- Who are you?
- Why was he blackmailing you?

380
00:39:25,417 --> 00:39:26,792
- What?
- Hey you!

381
00:39:27,292 --> 00:39:28,542
I'm Sub-Inspector...

382
00:39:28,792 --> 00:39:31,542
Are you mixed up with Bhuvan's
disappearance?

383
00:39:32,751 --> 00:39:33,751
Get out!

384
00:39:53,417 --> 00:39:56,292
- Who is that lady?
- Satyawati

385
00:39:57,417 --> 00:39:58,917
Sukumar's sister

386
00:40:03,542 --> 00:40:06,001
These people are big shots

387
00:40:06,792 --> 00:40:07,917
Be careful

388
00:40:40,751 --> 00:40:43,042
Your help has no sense.
I'll wait outside

389
00:40:45,292 --> 00:40:48,251
You felt no shame stealing
from a woman's bag...

390
00:40:49,251 --> 00:40:53,042
...so why be ashamed looking
at her in her bath?

391
00:40:55,042 --> 00:40:56,167
Give me one

392
00:40:57,001 --> 00:41:00,042
Don't get jumpy.
It's only a cigarette

393
00:41:10,042 --> 00:41:11,501
It's a cheap brand

394
00:41:32,626 --> 00:41:35,876
Why did Bhuvan's name scare you?

395
00:41:42,792 --> 00:41:45,917
A few weeks ago a man came
to meet Gajanan

396
00:41:48,167 --> 00:41:51,667
They talked for hours
behind closed doors

397
00:41:53,542 --> 00:41:55,542
Gajanan came out alone
from the room

398
00:41:57,417 --> 00:41:58,876
He was pale

399
00:42:00,667 --> 00:42:03,542
I had never seen him so scared

400
00:42:06,126 --> 00:42:08,917
I asked him about the visitor

401
00:42:10,042 --> 00:42:13,292
He said he was Bhuvan Banerjee

402
00:42:15,876 --> 00:42:19,167
The next day Gajanan locked up
the factory

403
00:42:19,626 --> 00:42:23,542
Was Gajanan at the factory
on 29 November night?

404
00:42:43,667 --> 00:42:45,917
We'll end up in jail

405
00:42:46,167 --> 00:42:47,376
Despite Anguri's alibi...

406
00:42:47,626 --> 00:42:50,751
...whatever happened,
happened at this factory

407
00:42:51,167 --> 00:42:53,751
There is a guard around.
Watch him

408
00:43:14,001 --> 00:43:15,876
We have the keys

409
00:43:17,626 --> 00:43:19,501
Have you permission?

410
00:43:22,667 --> 00:43:24,292
Are you from rat control?

411
00:43:26,042 --> 00:43:27,042
You're from Munger?

412
00:43:28,626 --> 00:43:29,667
Bhagalpur

413
00:43:29,876 --> 00:43:30,876
Terrific!

414
00:43:30,917 --> 00:43:31,917
Two-in-one

415
00:43:33,501 --> 00:43:36,126
Rats giving trouble in there?

416
00:43:36,417 --> 00:43:38,417
Plenty trouble. They die

417
00:43:39,001 --> 00:43:40,792
They rot. They stink

418
00:43:44,042 --> 00:43:45,876
Say something to me in English

419
00:43:47,167 --> 00:43:49,042
Anything. Sound strict

420
00:44:03,042 --> 00:44:06,042
My officer says he has a new poison

421
00:44:06,376 --> 00:44:08,917
Gets rid of all pests in a flash

422
00:44:09,542 --> 00:44:14,001
The paperwork for proper permissions
will take a month

423
00:44:14,667 --> 00:44:15,667
Well?

424
00:44:19,417 --> 00:44:22,417
- Are you really from Munger?
- Yes

425
00:44:24,167 --> 00:44:25,917
What about your family? Home?

426
00:44:26,251 --> 00:44:28,751
Cholera took my family. Cousins
took my house

427
00:44:29,792 --> 00:44:31,626
Came to Calcutta when I was 15

428
00:44:33,001 --> 00:44:36,042
A good lie is never far
from the truth

429
00:45:14,792 --> 00:45:17,917
New machines. Idle for two months?

430
00:45:31,417 --> 00:45:34,751
This is no dead rat, Byomkesh

431
00:46:18,542 --> 00:46:20,792
Call Special Branch

432
00:46:21,542 --> 00:46:23,001
He's been murdered

433
00:46:24,001 --> 00:46:28,167
His throat was slit. Then a sword
sliced through him - neck to belly

434
00:46:28,751 --> 00:46:30,042
My God!

435
00:46:43,417 --> 00:46:46,542
That's Mr. Bhuvan's wife.
Second wife

436
00:47:13,042 --> 00:47:14,042
Why?

437
00:47:18,376 --> 00:47:19,376
But Why?

438
00:47:39,542 --> 00:47:40,542
Why?

439
00:47:56,417 --> 00:47:57,417
May I?

440
00:48:01,001 --> 00:48:04,167
You weren't at the crematorium

441
00:48:05,167 --> 00:48:06,792
Want some paan?

442
00:48:07,792 --> 00:48:08,917
Don't eat paan

443
00:48:11,251 --> 00:48:14,167
Do you have Bhuvan's paan box?

444
00:48:25,626 --> 00:48:27,292
What was Bhuvan like?

445
00:48:29,292 --> 00:48:31,167
You would've got on well

446
00:48:32,542 --> 00:48:34,167
He made his own paan mix

447
00:48:37,001 --> 00:48:39,167
He gave it a name

448
00:48:41,251 --> 00:48:43,001
"Calcutta Kiss"

449
00:48:57,626 --> 00:48:59,292
Our first famous boarder

450
00:49:00,292 --> 00:49:01,501
Read it

451
00:49:03,042 --> 00:49:07,001
"A sensational murder and blackmail
case was solved by Bengal's pride...

452
00:49:07,292 --> 00:49:11,292
"...the brave talented young
detective Byomkesh Bakshy"

453
00:49:11,667 --> 00:49:13,251
Why did the paper come so late?

454
00:49:13,917 --> 00:49:16,251
Late? It's the usual time

455
00:49:17,667 --> 00:49:19,292
The paper comes now?

456
00:49:19,667 --> 00:49:22,542
Sometimes even later.
Listen to this

457
00:49:30,792 --> 00:49:34,751
"Broad chest, keen moustache,
eyes like embers...

458
00:49:37,126 --> 00:49:38,292
You fool

459
00:49:39,042 --> 00:49:41,001
"Our Sherlock Holmes..."

460
00:49:44,792 --> 00:49:47,042
Taxi! Police Headquarters

461
00:50:00,126 --> 00:50:01,917
Mister! Is this what we're doing
all day?

462
00:50:03,001 --> 00:50:04,542
- DC Wilkie's office?
- Upstairs

463
00:50:12,792 --> 00:50:14,792
Can I see the Dy. Commissioner?

464
00:50:16,501 --> 00:50:18,792
- It's urgent
- You can't barge in

465
00:50:21,001 --> 00:50:23,417
I'm a famous detective

466
00:50:24,751 --> 00:50:27,751
Tell him I have a hot lead on
the Bosepukur murders

467
00:50:28,501 --> 00:50:30,376
Your uncle is being framed.
I can save him

468
00:50:30,751 --> 00:50:32,001
Wait outside

469
00:50:32,376 --> 00:50:34,251
Send a note inside, Sergeant

470
00:50:34,542 --> 00:50:37,042
I'm Sikdaar's niece. The Council
Member?

471
00:50:37,501 --> 00:50:38,792
Now, Sergeant. Please

472
00:50:44,542 --> 00:50:46,042
A private detective?

473
00:50:46,667 --> 00:50:48,542
No... Yes

474
00:50:50,917 --> 00:50:53,792
- Who hired you?
- The corpse's son

475
00:50:55,501 --> 00:50:57,792
I mean Bhuvan Banerjee's son

476
00:51:04,292 --> 00:51:08,792
- You say these letters are phony?
- The stamp proves it

477
00:51:10,001 --> 00:51:13,667
The letters have been cut out from
the newspaper of that day

478
00:51:14,042 --> 00:51:17,417
Look at the stamp.
Posted at 7:30 am

479
00:51:18,251 --> 00:51:22,501
I can get 5 people to swear on oath
that the newspapers don't arrive...

480
00:51:22,792 --> 00:51:25,001
...at Bhuvan's lodge
before 8:30 am

481
00:51:35,751 --> 00:51:37,292
I can read now, thank you

482
00:51:37,542 --> 00:51:39,042
Sikdaar's being framed

483
00:51:39,417 --> 00:51:43,042
The dates on the letters coincide
with Bhuvan meeting Sikdaar

484
00:51:43,626 --> 00:51:46,626
Bhuvan vanished that day. The letters
were dated after his murder

485
00:51:47,001 --> 00:51:49,201
- Now do you believe me?
- When did you get the letters?

486
00:51:49,626 --> 00:51:53,251
Mr. Wilkie, you can call me anytime
if you want to harass me further

487
00:51:54,126 --> 00:51:55,292
Can I go now?

488
00:51:56,167 --> 00:51:57,542
- For now
- Thank you very much

489
00:51:57,792 --> 00:51:59,542
Who is threatening you?

490
00:51:59,751 --> 00:52:01,876
Not you, Mr. Bakshy

491
00:52:06,626 --> 00:52:09,792
What is your take on the
Bosepukur murders?

492
00:52:11,167 --> 00:52:12,542
Sir, this isn't the time

493
00:52:12,876 --> 00:52:15,001
I have a warrant in your name

494
00:52:15,292 --> 00:52:18,167
For impersonating an officer

495
00:52:19,792 --> 00:52:20,917
Tea?

496
00:52:27,542 --> 00:52:29,292
Going round in circles all day

497
00:52:29,667 --> 00:52:30,917
Not a bloody tram

498
00:52:37,667 --> 00:52:40,001
- Mr. Byomkesh
- I'll deal with you later

499
00:52:42,417 --> 00:52:43,876
- Mister!
- I'll be back

500
00:52:44,417 --> 00:52:46,917
The madman! He didn't pay me

501
00:52:47,751 --> 00:52:49,042
Taxi! Let's go. Hurry

502
00:52:49,376 --> 00:52:50,751
Where is Sikdaar?

503
00:52:58,792 --> 00:53:00,167
I must talk to you

504
00:53:05,292 --> 00:53:08,042
When did you get hold
of those letters?

505
00:53:14,917 --> 00:53:17,042
May I see Mr. Sikdaar?

506
00:53:21,167 --> 00:53:22,542
Gajanan...

507
00:53:24,042 --> 00:53:26,292
...can't see anyone right now

508
00:53:27,917 --> 00:53:29,751
No, he'll see me

509
00:53:30,292 --> 00:53:32,667
If it wasn't for me,
he'd be rotting in jail

510
00:53:37,376 --> 00:53:39,251
If it wasn't for you...

511
00:53:40,251 --> 00:53:42,501
...none of this would
have happened

512
00:53:46,626 --> 00:53:49,042
If it wasn't for you none of
this would have happened

513
00:53:52,167 --> 00:53:54,751
You wanted to know when
I got the letters?

514
00:53:55,792 --> 00:53:56,792
When?

515
00:53:56,876 --> 00:53:58,667
The first day we met...

516
00:53:59,667 --> 00:54:00,917
...that very morning

517
00:54:39,126 --> 00:54:40,126
Listen

518
00:54:41,167 --> 00:54:44,876
He wants to ask you something.
He saved your life

519
00:54:45,292 --> 00:54:48,292
Did Mr. Bhuvan meet you
in her flat on 23 November?

520
00:54:57,876 --> 00:54:58,917
Nibaran!

521
00:55:03,542 --> 00:55:06,292
- Call the doctor
- Save him, please

522
00:55:07,667 --> 00:55:08,792
Save him!

523
00:55:10,667 --> 00:55:11,667
Uncle...

524
00:55:14,542 --> 00:55:16,042
Did Bhuvan come to see you?

525
00:55:17,251 --> 00:55:19,376
Why? To blackmail you?

526
00:55:47,917 --> 00:55:48,917
Uncle

527
00:56:18,042 --> 00:56:19,417
99%

528
00:56:20,042 --> 00:56:22,167
Strychnine poisoning

529
00:56:23,001 --> 00:56:27,542
Send the soup to the lab.
The autopsy will tell us for sure

530
00:56:30,167 --> 00:56:33,542
I'll check on Anguri Devi.
She's still in shock

531
00:56:35,876 --> 00:56:37,501
Wherever there's a murder...

532
00:56:37,917 --> 00:56:40,376
...you're never far away

533
00:56:45,292 --> 00:56:47,376
- What is she saying?
- Nothing

534
00:56:48,126 --> 00:56:50,501
- Trying to save her brother
- Brother?

535
00:56:51,167 --> 00:56:53,042
In your presence, Sukumar...

536
00:56:53,292 --> 00:56:54,917
...threatened his uncle

537
00:56:56,042 --> 00:56:57,667
Stop us and we'll kill you

538
00:57:04,292 --> 00:57:05,917
My brother is innocent

539
00:57:07,417 --> 00:57:09,042
He couldn't murder anyone

540
00:57:09,626 --> 00:57:13,542
I don't know if he could or not.
But I know he didn't

541
00:57:18,667 --> 00:57:20,542
Did he know Mr. Bhuvan?

542
00:57:23,042 --> 00:57:26,292
What were Sikdaar and Bhuvan
fighting about?

543
00:57:30,167 --> 00:57:32,042
Your silence may...

544
00:57:33,001 --> 00:57:35,042
...send your brother to the gallows

545
00:57:41,167 --> 00:57:43,917
My brother doesn't care about
his life any more

546
00:57:46,542 --> 00:57:47,917
Do you recognise this?

547
00:57:51,751 --> 00:57:52,876
Strychnine

548
00:57:55,917 --> 00:57:58,626
We found it in Sukumar's room

549
00:58:05,251 --> 00:58:08,501
When you see Sukumar thank him...

550
00:58:09,251 --> 00:58:12,376
...for keeping the poison where
anyone could find it

551
00:58:12,751 --> 00:58:15,501
And threatening his uncle when
everyone could hear him

552
00:58:42,917 --> 00:58:45,667
You made my father and me famous

553
00:58:48,667 --> 00:58:50,626
They threw me out of the hostel

554
00:58:52,792 --> 00:58:54,376
A blackmailer's son

555
00:58:57,042 --> 00:58:58,542
Can I stay here?

556
00:58:59,126 --> 00:59:03,667
Dr. Guha went out of town. He'll
be back by Spring Day

557
00:59:04,126 --> 00:59:06,292
He left this for you

558
00:59:06,751 --> 00:59:09,251
Your father was not a blackmailer

559
00:59:19,376 --> 00:59:20,376
So then?

560
00:59:21,292 --> 00:59:23,792
- What about Mr. Sikdaar?
- He was murdered

561
00:59:25,001 --> 00:59:26,001
BY Whom?

562
00:59:26,542 --> 00:59:29,626
I don't know. But it's the same man
who killed your father

563
00:59:31,167 --> 00:59:32,667
He framed Sukumar

564
00:59:33,167 --> 00:59:34,167
Open it!

565
00:59:40,042 --> 00:59:42,876
- He faked the letters too
- Faked?

566
00:59:43,876 --> 00:59:45,667
He made a fool of me

567
00:59:46,042 --> 00:59:48,876
He even faked the postage stamp

568
00:59:49,792 --> 00:59:51,501
- How?
- Nothing simpler

569
00:59:53,376 --> 00:59:56,042
Bribe a poor postmaster,
write your letter

570
00:59:56,292 --> 00:59:57,751
And add the date you want

571
00:59:58,042 --> 01:00:00,917
And fool the moron Byomkesh
Bakshy...

572
01:00:10,292 --> 01:00:12,292
"Yours truly, Dr. Anukul Guha"

573
01:00:52,292 --> 01:00:54,126
Byomkesh, open the door!

574
01:01:18,167 --> 01:01:21,292
He took off like a rocket and
rolled back like a deflated ball

575
01:01:23,292 --> 01:01:25,251
He hasn't had a thing
to eat or drink

576
01:01:25,667 --> 01:01:26,667
What's wrong?

577
01:01:27,042 --> 01:01:28,542
Tummy ache

578
01:01:30,626 --> 01:01:33,167
If only Dr. Guha were here to
give him medicine

579
01:01:48,667 --> 01:01:49,751
Puntiram!

580
01:02:03,167 --> 01:02:06,167
- The police followed you?
- I know how to lose them

581
01:02:23,792 --> 01:02:25,667
My mother left me this jewelry

582
01:02:26,876 --> 01:02:28,626
Just name your price

583
01:02:32,501 --> 01:02:34,542
But find my brother

584
01:02:37,876 --> 01:02:38,917
Why me?

585
01:02:40,042 --> 01:02:41,917
A maiden in distress

586
01:02:42,501 --> 01:02:44,292
Because you see things

587
01:02:52,667 --> 01:02:55,667
My brother and my uncle
never saw eye to eye

588
01:02:56,251 --> 01:02:58,792
Things really fell apart in
the past two months

589
01:03:00,042 --> 01:03:03,376
They fought endlessly over
the Party

590
01:03:04,167 --> 01:03:07,542
Finally my brother split the Party,
formed his own

591
01:03:10,251 --> 01:03:13,667
Your uncle implied Sukumar was
under someone's influence

592
01:03:14,167 --> 01:03:16,292
My brother had changed a lot

593
01:03:16,917 --> 01:03:18,417
Even I could see it

594
01:03:18,792 --> 01:03:21,792
When did Bhuvan Banerjee
start working with your uncle?

595
01:03:24,167 --> 01:03:27,876
Two years ago. He'd come
to uncle's factory

596
01:03:28,376 --> 01:03:31,917
He had some new machinery
installed there

597
01:03:33,001 --> 01:03:34,792
Bhuvan installed the machines?

598
01:03:35,042 --> 01:03:36,042
Yes

599
01:03:39,876 --> 01:03:40,917
What's this?

600
01:03:43,876 --> 01:03:44,876
Fries?

601
01:03:46,001 --> 01:03:47,792
You said he had an upset tummy

602
01:03:48,501 --> 01:03:49,542
Want to kill him?

603
01:03:49,917 --> 01:03:53,376
Boil rice in yoghurt. I'll come
down and see to the rest

604
01:03:54,167 --> 01:03:54,792
Go

605
01:03:55,042 --> 01:03:56,417
When did you last see Sukumar?

606
01:03:56,917 --> 01:03:59,167
When you came yesterday

607
01:03:59,751 --> 01:04:01,917
You didn't pay the taxi fare

608
01:04:02,792 --> 01:04:05,751
He took my taxi. Did you
tell the police?

609
01:04:06,167 --> 01:04:08,042
- I told no one
- The taxi driver!

610
01:04:31,542 --> 01:04:32,667
I'm off

611
01:04:33,001 --> 01:04:35,542
The Whites call me bad names here

612
01:04:36,251 --> 01:04:37,667
The mister is nuts

613
01:04:38,167 --> 01:04:39,542
Don't you know him?

614
01:04:40,167 --> 01:04:42,042
The Dy. Commissioner's
right-hand man

615
01:04:53,501 --> 01:04:55,626
Does Sukumar have bad teeth?

616
01:04:56,667 --> 01:04:57,667
No

617
01:04:58,042 --> 01:04:59,042
How old are you?

618
01:04:59,167 --> 01:05:01,292
24 years 5 months

619
01:05:01,667 --> 01:05:05,751
I'm three months younger. I don't
need a dentist. Do you?

620
01:05:06,167 --> 01:05:07,667
I know a brain surgeon

621
01:05:08,042 --> 01:05:10,001
- How old are you?
- I don't need a dentist

622
01:05:11,542 --> 01:05:13,042
Sukumar is our age

623
01:05:13,542 --> 01:05:17,417
But he came to visit a dentist.
Dr. Watanabe

624
01:05:18,167 --> 01:05:20,501
They left in a black car

625
01:05:22,001 --> 01:05:23,542
He's been here before. Why?

626
01:05:25,417 --> 01:05:27,876
Go home. I'll be in touch

627
01:05:28,167 --> 01:05:30,876
- Let me drop...
- The helpless maiden

628
01:05:36,417 --> 01:05:38,792
- Ever had a toothache, young man?
- No

629
01:05:39,126 --> 01:05:40,292
Ever acted?

630
01:05:40,792 --> 01:05:41,792
No

631
01:05:47,292 --> 01:05:48,542
Dr. Watanabe

632
01:05:49,126 --> 01:05:51,167
My brother is dying

633
01:05:55,417 --> 01:05:56,751
The doctor is at the temple

634
01:05:57,126 --> 01:05:58,876
We'll wait. He's in pain

635
01:05:59,042 --> 01:06:00,667
After the temple, lunch

636
01:06:01,042 --> 01:06:04,001
He doesn't treat anyone after lunch

637
01:06:04,751 --> 01:06:06,167
He teaches Japanese

638
01:06:06,417 --> 01:06:07,667
Come tomorrow

639
01:06:08,292 --> 01:06:12,542
My brother is dying...
to learn Japanese

640
01:06:15,542 --> 01:06:17,376
Which temple did you say?

641
01:06:32,251 --> 01:06:35,001
Is that his style of pulling teeth
or teaching Japanese?

642
01:06:37,501 --> 01:06:38,501
The question is...

643
01:06:39,042 --> 01:06:41,292
...if Sukumar didn't need a dentist...

644
01:06:41,667 --> 01:06:43,542
...why was he learning Japanese?

645
01:06:55,001 --> 01:06:56,042
I beg your pardon

646
01:06:56,417 --> 01:06:58,292
I was trying out my Japanese

647
01:06:59,042 --> 01:07:00,042
It's bad

648
01:07:03,251 --> 01:07:04,917
Your bad Japanese...

649
01:07:07,667 --> 01:07:09,917
...is actually bad Chinese

650
01:07:10,917 --> 01:07:12,667
Sir, same to same for me

651
01:07:25,792 --> 01:07:27,542
This is Japanese

652
01:07:29,501 --> 01:07:30,751
It's different

653
01:07:32,542 --> 01:07:33,542
Who sent you?

654
01:07:36,626 --> 01:07:37,667
Sukumar

655
01:07:38,876 --> 01:07:40,501
Your former student

656
01:07:40,917 --> 01:07:42,751
We're from his Party

657
01:07:43,501 --> 01:07:47,042
We have little time before
Spring Day

658
01:07:49,917 --> 01:07:52,626
Volunteers for the Spring Day Action,
register now

659
01:07:53,001 --> 01:07:55,001
Dr. Guha will be back by Spring Day

660
01:07:57,542 --> 01:07:59,001
Are you ready to kill...

661
01:07:59,667 --> 01:08:00,876
...and be killed?

662
01:08:03,251 --> 01:08:04,917
Answer me this

663
01:08:06,917 --> 01:08:09,667
How many could you kill...

664
01:08:10,667 --> 01:08:12,292
...for your country?

665
01:08:14,001 --> 01:08:15,001
Byomkesh!

666
01:08:17,501 --> 01:08:18,667
You here?

667
01:08:20,042 --> 01:08:24,042
He says that Sukumar
sent him to me

668
01:08:25,251 --> 01:08:29,001
Sukumar? But you're not
on the volunteers' list

669
01:08:32,417 --> 01:08:33,626
Excuse me

670
01:08:38,876 --> 01:08:39,917
Damn it

671
01:08:40,501 --> 01:08:41,501
Let's go

672
01:08:41,792 --> 01:08:43,626
What just happened?

673
01:08:46,542 --> 01:08:49,917
Dr. Guha, Sukumar and Watanabe
are planning something

674
01:08:50,626 --> 01:08:52,751
We almost found out what it was

675
01:08:55,292 --> 01:08:57,917
I have to think.
I need some quiet

676
01:09:00,917 --> 01:09:03,251
ls Sukumar's plan connected
to my father's murder?

677
01:09:03,542 --> 01:09:04,542
Utterly connected

678
01:09:04,792 --> 01:09:07,251
Something tells me - because
of this plan...

679
01:09:07,501 --> 01:09:09,542
...your father vanished...

680
01:09:09,917 --> 01:09:11,042
...and was murdered

681
01:09:11,292 --> 01:09:14,542
And Gajanan Sikdaar was framed

682
01:09:15,001 --> 01:09:17,667
When I found out,
Sikdaar was killed

683
01:09:18,001 --> 01:09:21,042
Then Sukumar was framed.
Now he's on the run

684
01:09:21,417 --> 01:09:25,001
He's plotting something big
on Spring Day

685
01:09:25,376 --> 01:09:27,917
The whole chain is connected
to Spring Day

686
01:09:28,167 --> 01:09:31,251
It starts with Bhuvan
and ends with Sukumar

687
01:09:31,792 --> 01:09:33,167
- Get it?
- No

688
01:09:33,667 --> 01:09:35,167
What about Dr. Guha?

689
01:09:36,751 --> 01:09:38,001
Not what. Why?

690
01:09:38,876 --> 01:09:40,417
Why did Dr. Guha do it?

691
01:09:41,001 --> 01:09:43,292
And why admit it to me?

692
01:09:43,667 --> 01:09:44,792
Keep moving

693
01:09:53,167 --> 01:09:55,292
- Where to?
- To see Badal

694
01:09:56,001 --> 01:09:58,167
- Badal?
- Our college theatre dress man

695
01:09:58,292 --> 01:09:59,292
Why?

696
01:09:59,417 --> 01:10:01,542
I want to be an actor

697
01:10:47,042 --> 01:10:50,167
You wanted to be on stage,
so why get me painted?

698
01:10:52,001 --> 01:10:53,501
Look towards the gate

699
01:11:00,792 --> 01:11:02,542
Shall we hunt the hunter?

700
01:11:12,167 --> 01:11:13,167
Let's go

701
01:11:48,042 --> 01:11:49,542
He's reporting to Watanabe

702
01:11:57,417 --> 01:11:59,917
He's heading to Sukumar next

703
01:12:11,917 --> 01:12:13,751
Watanabe is frightening

704
01:12:22,667 --> 01:12:24,167
How long do we wait?

705
01:12:25,042 --> 01:12:27,251
Sukumar's black car

706
01:13:13,042 --> 01:13:14,417
He's locked it and run

707
01:13:15,251 --> 01:13:16,251
Step aside

708
01:14:02,167 --> 01:14:04,042
He's destroyed the evidence
and fled

709
01:14:32,667 --> 01:14:34,917
Take all the documents you can find

710
01:15:04,417 --> 01:15:05,542
Are you alright?

711
01:15:29,001 --> 01:15:32,917
Didn't you say that Dr. Guha
was not coming back?

712
01:15:33,251 --> 01:15:34,542
He's back

713
01:15:35,042 --> 01:15:39,001
He's on the terrace. The Japs are
bombing the docks... boom!

714
01:15:49,167 --> 01:15:51,626
Can you hear that, Mr. Bakshy?

715
01:15:55,292 --> 01:15:58,417
Nails being hammered
into the British coffin

716
01:16:00,251 --> 01:16:03,667
You killed Bhuvan and Sikdaar

717
01:16:13,792 --> 01:16:15,626
I did everything

718
01:16:17,251 --> 01:16:19,417
You know but won't admit it

719
01:16:20,417 --> 01:16:23,667
- Why kill Bhuvan?
- Bhuvan was a traitor

720
01:16:25,376 --> 01:16:29,876
Sikdaar a false patriot who was
going to inform the police

721
01:16:30,667 --> 01:16:34,001
So you and Sukumar are plotting
something with the Japanese?

722
01:16:40,542 --> 01:16:43,042
An enemy's enemy is a friend

723
01:16:48,542 --> 01:16:50,292
Why kill Sikdaar?

724
01:16:50,626 --> 01:16:53,501
Wouldn't you do a small
bad thing...

725
01:16:54,042 --> 01:16:56,292
...for the greater good?

726
01:16:58,001 --> 01:17:02,251
And the dead in the clinic? Where's
the greater good in that?

727
01:17:02,792 --> 01:17:05,167
They're dead because of you

728
01:17:05,751 --> 01:17:07,001
It's the price

729
01:17:08,251 --> 01:17:11,751
We all want freedom. No one wants
to pay the price

730
01:17:16,042 --> 01:17:17,042
And now?

731
01:17:18,001 --> 01:17:21,167
If you go to the police, I'll kill you

732
01:17:22,917 --> 01:17:25,667
If you survive, it's the end for me

733
01:17:31,292 --> 01:17:33,542
What shall we do, Mr. Bakshy?

734
01:17:40,167 --> 01:17:41,167
Byomkesh

735
01:17:45,542 --> 01:17:48,417
My war needs soldiers like you

736
01:17:50,167 --> 01:17:51,667
There's a car waiting

737
01:17:52,667 --> 01:17:54,042
Come with me

738
01:17:55,292 --> 01:17:56,501
Don't think

739
01:18:38,292 --> 01:18:39,292
Ajit

740
01:18:42,542 --> 01:18:45,042
Do middle-class folk like us...

741
01:18:45,917 --> 01:18:47,501
...ever stand up for our country?

742
01:18:49,042 --> 01:18:50,042
No, we go to the movies

743
01:18:50,542 --> 01:18:52,792
Let's go to the Metro

744
01:18:57,167 --> 01:18:58,542
Do it for your country

745
01:18:59,042 --> 01:19:01,667
Why not join Dr. Guha?
He seems to love you

746
01:19:04,042 --> 01:19:05,542
This map...

747
01:19:10,167 --> 01:19:12,792
This map looks familiar.
How did the volunteer have it?

748
01:19:13,167 --> 01:19:15,292
You should've been
my father's son

749
01:19:16,167 --> 01:19:17,751
He was ashamed of me

750
01:19:18,542 --> 01:19:19,917
I wanted to write

751
01:19:20,542 --> 01:19:22,126
I was the shy skinny type

752
01:19:27,667 --> 01:19:30,792
He came home drunk every night,
ranting

753
01:19:32,376 --> 01:19:36,417
"The creator of India's top selling
formula is cursed with a son...

754
01:19:37,417 --> 01:19:38,917
"...who failed High School
chemistry!"

755
01:19:39,292 --> 01:19:42,001
- Hind Chemics make ******
- They sell it

756
01:19:43,417 --> 01:19:45,167
My father invented the formula

757
01:19:48,792 --> 01:19:51,417
But you said you didn't know
what he did

758
01:19:52,417 --> 01:19:53,667
I meant in the last 3 years

759
01:19:54,376 --> 01:19:55,542
Before that, he was...

760
01:19:55,876 --> 01:19:58,542
...the head chemist at Hind Chemics
for -8-years

761
01:19:59,667 --> 01:20:01,042
- Until...
- What?

762
01:20:04,917 --> 01:20:07,001
Hind Chemics...

763
01:20:07,667 --> 01:20:09,251
...fired my genius father

764
01:20:09,501 --> 01:20:12,917
Because one of the components
in his formula was...

765
01:20:14,542 --> 01:20:15,542
...opium

766
01:20:18,251 --> 01:20:19,917
People got addicted...

767
01:20:20,751 --> 01:20:22,042
...without knowing

768
01:20:23,001 --> 01:20:24,542
Sales shot sky high

769
01:20:28,876 --> 01:20:31,542
- When were you going to tell me?
- What's there to tell?

770
01:20:31,917 --> 01:20:35,042
- You're hiding facts again
- But this is personal

771
01:20:35,376 --> 01:20:37,917
Personal? We're solving a case

772
01:20:39,251 --> 01:20:40,251
We decided...

773
01:20:40,417 --> 01:20:42,542
We decided that you'd keep
nothing from me

774
01:20:42,876 --> 01:20:45,626
- You're soft-headed
- You're soft-headed!

775
01:20:47,251 --> 01:20:50,042
- We're arguing. Later
- One minute, Mr. Byomkesh

776
01:20:50,751 --> 01:20:51,792
What is it?

777
01:20:52,417 --> 01:20:54,667
Can I have some Bhuvan's
paan mix?

778
01:20:55,292 --> 01:20:58,417
Just a little. Haven't slept for
three nights

779
01:20:58,792 --> 01:20:59,917
Please!

780
01:21:09,542 --> 01:21:12,167
Your father had magic
in his hands

781
01:21:19,667 --> 01:21:20,917
I asked Mr. Bhuvan...

782
01:21:21,542 --> 01:21:22,917
...so many times...

783
01:21:23,292 --> 01:21:24,917
...what's in his paan mix?

784
01:21:26,917 --> 01:21:28,001
He would laugh

785
01:21:29,001 --> 01:21:30,167
And say...

786
01:21:31,417 --> 01:21:32,542
"Pluck the fruit...

787
01:21:34,042 --> 01:21:35,542
...don't count the branches"

788
01:21:54,376 --> 01:21:55,376
Carry on arguing

789
01:21:56,167 --> 01:21:57,167
I'm done

790
01:22:10,667 --> 01:22:11,751
Who is it?

791
01:22:15,917 --> 01:22:19,042
Can Satyawati be called beautiful?

792
01:22:29,167 --> 01:22:30,167
Young gun

793
01:22:31,292 --> 01:22:32,667
Young guns?

794
01:22:33,542 --> 01:22:36,251
What did Sikdaar say to me
just before he died?

795
01:22:37,001 --> 01:22:39,501
What did you eat before going
to bed?

796
01:22:46,667 --> 01:22:48,167
The paan mix

797
01:22:53,751 --> 01:22:55,417
Your father had magic hands

798
01:22:56,542 --> 01:22:57,667
Opened my mind

799
01:23:06,792 --> 01:23:08,667
Paan, lime paste, catechu

800
01:23:10,042 --> 01:23:12,001
How do you like my painting?

801
01:23:14,417 --> 01:23:18,542
If Bhuvan Banerjee was not
blackmailing Sikdaar...

802
01:23:19,167 --> 01:23:22,792
...why did Sikdaar need
police protection?

803
01:23:28,542 --> 01:23:30,542
And about your father's...

804
01:23:30,876 --> 01:23:33,542
...paan mix. Why is it magical?

805
01:23:52,542 --> 01:23:54,417
Genius, what brings you here?

806
01:23:56,167 --> 01:23:57,167
Atanu

807
01:23:59,792 --> 01:24:02,042
- I need your help
- Unlikely, Byomkesh

808
01:24:03,001 --> 01:24:04,917
You sent me a note,
so here I am

809
01:24:05,251 --> 01:24:06,251
But I can't do more

810
01:24:06,417 --> 01:24:07,917
I'm not looking for a job

811
01:24:08,292 --> 01:24:10,042
I want you to test something

812
01:24:12,667 --> 01:24:13,667
Test what?

813
01:24:14,001 --> 01:24:15,417
This paan mix

814
01:24:16,251 --> 01:24:17,376
And my blood

815
01:24:30,667 --> 01:24:34,751
They test your blood before
giving you a job here?

816
01:24:42,292 --> 01:24:44,001
Never thought you'd stoop so low

817
01:24:45,001 --> 01:24:47,917
You shoot up heroin and then
test your blood?

818
01:24:49,542 --> 01:24:50,626
What's the farce?

819
01:24:52,251 --> 01:24:53,417
Heroin?

820
01:24:55,626 --> 01:24:57,792
My blood has heroin?

821
01:25:02,001 --> 01:25:03,542
And this?

822
01:25:04,292 --> 01:25:07,126
A paan mix is a paan mix.
Test it all you want

823
01:25:09,501 --> 01:25:11,501
Never seen crystals like these

824
01:25:12,542 --> 01:25:13,542
They are empty

825
01:25:14,001 --> 01:25:15,042
They're empty?

826
01:25:15,792 --> 01:25:17,292
I mean chemically

827
01:25:18,042 --> 01:25:20,876
A mix of hydrocarbons, salts

828
01:25:21,292 --> 01:25:23,417
Nothing in there. Useless

829
01:25:23,667 --> 01:25:25,626
No heroin in the crystals?

830
01:25:26,042 --> 01:25:27,751
Crystals? What crystals?

831
01:25:28,376 --> 01:25:30,292
You tutored my wife Leela
so I helped

832
01:25:40,542 --> 01:25:43,417
- You smell bad
- Your father was a genius

833
01:25:50,542 --> 01:25:53,667
Byomkesh, some paan mix
for me

834
01:25:54,042 --> 01:25:57,001
- You're a heroin addict
- I'm a chief accountant

835
01:25:57,417 --> 01:26:00,251
Bhuvan used you like a guinea pig

836
01:26:03,292 --> 01:26:04,417
A guinea pig?

837
01:26:08,626 --> 01:26:09,751
Mr. Kanai

838
01:26:19,542 --> 01:26:20,876
How's business?

839
01:26:21,917 --> 01:26:22,917
Dull

840
01:26:23,251 --> 01:26:25,417
Dull? How come?

841
01:26:29,042 --> 01:26:31,167
No opium in the market

842
01:26:32,001 --> 01:26:34,626
Can't buy any for love or money

843
01:26:39,292 --> 01:26:41,667
Heroin is made from opium, right?

844
01:26:45,667 --> 01:26:48,417
In your line of work
you must know dealers...

845
01:26:50,001 --> 01:26:51,626
...who bend the law a little

846
01:26:52,501 --> 01:26:56,376
You planning something that
bends the law a little?

847
01:26:59,542 --> 01:27:00,626
Let's imagine

848
01:27:03,542 --> 01:27:04,751
We tell them...

849
01:27:06,251 --> 01:27:09,542
...there's a kind of heroin that
cannot be detected

850
01:27:10,167 --> 01:27:12,167
It's like hitting the jackpot
for them

851
01:27:17,417 --> 01:27:18,751
I don't get it

852
01:27:19,917 --> 01:27:21,417
Doesn't look like heroin

853
01:27:21,751 --> 01:27:25,542
Smell or taste like heroin.
Doesn't show up in a lab test

854
01:27:25,917 --> 01:27:27,542
But once you take it inside

855
01:27:28,917 --> 01:27:30,667
...it's pure heroin

856
01:27:31,667 --> 01:27:34,542
What if this thing fell
into someone's lap?

857
01:27:38,042 --> 01:27:39,626
He'd be very rich

858
01:27:41,251 --> 01:27:42,417
Or very dead

859
01:27:44,042 --> 01:27:45,292
You have this thing?

860
01:27:46,667 --> 01:27:48,042
You know dealers?

861
01:27:59,792 --> 01:28:01,626
Not a grain of opium
in Calcutta

862
01:28:02,167 --> 01:28:04,167
Junkies wander the streets begging

863
01:28:06,167 --> 01:28:08,376
No opium for him either

864
01:28:12,417 --> 01:28:14,417
So where are your dealers?

865
01:28:16,542 --> 01:28:19,001
- Have you told anyone?
- No

866
01:28:22,001 --> 01:28:23,917
Wait here. I'll be back

867
01:28:30,417 --> 01:28:32,542
Did Ching Ling just leave?

868
01:28:33,001 --> 01:28:34,667
- Ching Ling?
- No

869
01:28:37,792 --> 01:28:39,001
Ching Ling?

870
01:28:43,501 --> 01:28:44,667
- What is it?
- Nothing

871
01:28:45,292 --> 01:28:46,417
I know what you're doing

872
01:28:46,626 --> 01:28:47,292
What am I doing?

873
01:28:47,542 --> 01:28:50,042
You're playing and my father
is your plaything

874
01:28:50,501 --> 01:28:53,751
Sometimes he's a blackmailer.
Or sometimes a traitor

875
01:28:54,251 --> 01:28:55,792
And now he's a drug dealer

876
01:28:56,667 --> 01:28:58,167
Your father made the drug...

877
01:28:58,501 --> 01:29:00,542
...and installed the machines
at the factory. Why?

878
01:29:00,876 --> 01:29:01,917
Ask Dr. Guha

879
01:29:02,167 --> 01:29:04,167
Opium dries up in the market.
Where did it all go?

880
01:29:04,501 --> 01:29:05,626
Add two and two

881
01:29:06,292 --> 01:29:08,252
Is it my fault your father
expected more from you?

882
01:29:09,292 --> 01:29:10,292
Sorry

883
01:29:34,251 --> 01:29:35,251
Ajit!

884
01:29:42,917 --> 01:29:45,292
Don't fight, Ajit. They're the police

885
01:30:11,751 --> 01:30:13,542
Send my friend Ajit Banerjee
to me

886
01:30:17,667 --> 01:30:20,542
Otherwise the police will never
find out why...

887
01:30:20,917 --> 01:30:23,417
...the opium in Calcutta
has vanished

888
01:30:26,042 --> 01:30:27,042
Tea?

889
01:30:44,001 --> 01:30:46,001
What do you know about
the missing opium?

890
01:30:48,001 --> 01:30:49,542
It's being cooked into heroin

891
01:30:50,292 --> 01:30:53,667
Following the genius chemist
Bhuvan Banerjee's formula

892
01:30:54,417 --> 01:30:57,542
A kind of heroin that can only
be detected...

893
01:30:58,417 --> 01:31:01,667
...once it's in the bloodstream

894
01:31:13,626 --> 01:31:15,376
Heard of Yang Guang?

895
01:31:24,626 --> 01:31:26,542
And the Shanghai Green Gang?

896
01:31:27,251 --> 01:31:28,251
Who hasn't?

897
01:31:32,167 --> 01:31:36,542
Yang Guang was No. 3 in the
Shanghai Green Gang

898
01:31:37,792 --> 01:31:41,167
He wanted to be No. 2,
so he came to Calcutta

899
01:31:42,751 --> 01:31:46,251
He took over the Thailand-Burma,
Burma-Calcutta opium supply

900
01:31:47,042 --> 01:31:50,501
He started running the
South Asian drug empire

901
01:31:51,501 --> 01:31:53,292
Calcutta was in his grip

902
01:31:53,667 --> 01:31:54,667
Then?

903
01:31:56,001 --> 01:31:58,667
September 1939

904
01:32:00,542 --> 01:32:04,292
A Green Gang team arrived in
Calcutta from Shanghai

905
01:32:05,626 --> 01:32:07,667
They met Yang Guang at the docks

906
01:32:08,042 --> 01:32:09,917
There was a fight

907
01:32:13,001 --> 01:32:14,542
Yang Guang was finished

908
01:32:15,167 --> 01:32:17,001
His eight-year rule ended

909
01:32:17,667 --> 01:32:19,501
But now?

910
01:32:21,042 --> 01:32:23,917
We fished out four Chinamen
from the river

911
01:32:25,001 --> 01:32:26,917
Locals from the Green Gang

912
01:32:27,917 --> 01:32:29,167
One man was still alive

913
01:32:30,001 --> 01:32:31,667
Before dying he told us...

914
01:32:32,001 --> 01:32:36,292
500 kgs of opium belonging to the
Green Gang had landed in Calcutta...

915
01:32:37,167 --> 01:32:38,876
...and was hijacked

916
01:32:40,542 --> 01:32:42,667
- The hijacker...
- Yang Guang

917
01:32:44,167 --> 01:32:46,542
They say he's back
from the dead

918
01:32:49,792 --> 01:32:51,792
Know anything about it?

919
01:32:53,251 --> 01:32:54,251
No, sir

920
01:32:54,417 --> 01:32:56,667
Before I found out, your goons
stopped me

921
01:32:56,917 --> 01:32:59,792
How did you know I was looking
for the opium...

922
01:33:00,001 --> 01:33:01,542
...belonging to the Green Gang?

923
01:33:01,876 --> 01:33:02,542
We...

924
01:33:02,667 --> 01:33:05,542
...have our ways.
I forgot. Sorry

925
01:33:06,292 --> 01:33:07,292
May I leave?

926
01:33:12,292 --> 01:33:14,751
If the heroin gets into the
wrong hands...

927
01:33:15,417 --> 01:33:17,376
...and you hide it from me...

928
01:33:17,917 --> 01:33:19,542
...you'll stand before...

929
01:33:19,917 --> 01:33:23,167
...a firing squad in Fort William

930
01:33:24,667 --> 01:33:25,667
Understand?

931
01:33:26,792 --> 01:33:28,167
Satyawati's gone?

932
01:33:29,292 --> 01:33:30,292
Where to?

933
01:33:32,167 --> 01:33:33,376
I don't know

934
01:33:34,292 --> 01:33:37,042
She got a letter from Mr. Sukumar
at 5 this morning

935
01:33:37,501 --> 01:33:38,792
Someone came in a car

936
01:33:39,001 --> 01:33:40,417
And you let her go?

937
01:33:42,042 --> 01:33:43,251
I tried to stop her

938
01:33:43,667 --> 01:33:46,167
She said she was going to
her brother

939
01:33:48,542 --> 01:33:52,376
She said: "Ask no more
if you want our safety"

940
01:34:01,417 --> 01:34:02,792
Byomkesh, eat something

941
01:34:03,251 --> 01:34:06,042
I let you down. And Satyawati

942
01:34:07,876 --> 01:34:09,376
You need some fresh air

943
01:34:09,667 --> 01:34:12,667
It's staring at me in the face,
yet...

944
01:34:13,167 --> 01:34:14,792
Take a stroll in the park

945
01:34:15,042 --> 01:34:17,542
This map is the key to Yang Guang

946
01:34:17,917 --> 01:34:19,667
Or else take a boat ride
in the Ganges

947
01:34:19,876 --> 01:34:21,751
One clue. Need one clue

948
01:34:24,542 --> 01:34:25,917
What did you say?

949
01:34:26,542 --> 01:34:27,542
What!

950
01:34:27,876 --> 01:34:28,876
Ganges river

951
01:34:29,042 --> 01:34:30,167
Puntiram!

952
01:34:52,167 --> 01:34:55,167
You should be the detective
and me your idiot assistant

953
01:34:56,251 --> 01:34:57,876
Where did I see this map before?

954
01:34:59,417 --> 01:35:02,292
The route map of the Ganges

955
01:35:03,751 --> 01:35:04,751
Get it?

956
01:35:08,417 --> 01:35:11,042
Sukumar, Dr. Guha and Watanabe...

957
01:35:11,542 --> 01:35:14,292
...have a plan linked to the river

958
01:35:14,667 --> 01:35:16,917
Yang Guang is planning
something with the heroin

959
01:35:17,167 --> 01:35:19,251
The two plans are connected

960
01:35:22,876 --> 01:35:24,251
But what is this?

961
01:35:30,167 --> 01:35:31,917
Where did you disappear?

962
01:35:35,001 --> 01:35:37,876
When I came back,
you two were gone

963
01:35:38,292 --> 01:35:40,542
Sorry. I lied to you

964
01:35:41,376 --> 01:35:43,042
I'm not a drug dealer

965
01:35:44,667 --> 01:35:48,042
I'm looking for a gangster
called Yang Guang

966
01:35:53,792 --> 01:35:57,376
He was killed by the Green Gang
four years ago

967
01:35:59,042 --> 01:36:02,042
What if the Green Gang hears that
I know Yang Guang is still alive?

968
01:36:12,042 --> 01:36:14,167
This opium den is run by
the Green Gang

969
01:36:14,751 --> 01:36:17,792
I've spread the word you have
information on Yang Guang

970
01:36:18,542 --> 01:36:20,501
You're playing with our lives now

971
01:36:22,126 --> 01:36:24,042
They're dangerous, Byomkesh

972
01:36:27,792 --> 01:36:30,126
Ajit, please don't start a fight today

973
01:37:23,417 --> 01:37:26,167
Yang Guang? Who?

974
01:37:26,792 --> 01:37:29,751
The man sitting on your opium,
stolen 2 months ago

975
01:37:30,001 --> 01:37:31,751
That Yang Guang

976
01:37:44,667 --> 01:37:47,417
Why is he sitting on my opium,
good boy?

977
01:37:47,917 --> 01:37:48,917
Answer!

978
01:37:54,542 --> 01:37:57,751
We're both looking for
the same man

979
01:37:58,167 --> 01:37:59,876
Let's work together

980
01:38:05,167 --> 01:38:06,167
Kill them

981
01:38:09,042 --> 01:38:10,042
What is it?

982
01:38:10,542 --> 01:38:12,167
How did he know about the opium?

983
01:38:12,876 --> 01:38:14,751
Only Yang Guang knows.
And we know

984
01:38:15,042 --> 01:38:17,667
- He's tricking us
- Wait! The police know

985
01:38:18,751 --> 01:38:20,917
He's Comm. Wilkie's man.
Kill a cop and we're dead

986
01:38:21,042 --> 01:38:22,167
He's a cop

987
01:38:24,417 --> 01:38:27,126
The police want to catch
Yang Guang through me

988
01:38:27,542 --> 01:38:29,292
Kill us and forget about
Yang Guang...

989
01:38:29,667 --> 01:38:31,167
...and your opium

990
01:38:41,417 --> 01:38:43,251
What are these points?

991
01:38:43,751 --> 01:38:46,292
Sahibkuthi Ghat, Budiganga
Ghat and...

992
01:38:47,167 --> 01:38:48,251
...Kushi Ghat

993
01:38:51,126 --> 01:38:53,292
His secret landing spots

994
01:38:54,042 --> 01:38:57,042
He knew the river Ganges
by heart

995
01:38:59,917 --> 01:39:04,042
- If he did, who is this map for?
- Who did you get it from?

996
01:39:04,542 --> 01:39:05,917
A volunteer in Sukumar's Party

997
01:39:06,167 --> 01:39:07,876
He has links with the Japanese

998
01:39:08,667 --> 01:39:11,501
What is Sukumar's connection to
Yang Guang's opium route?

999
01:39:11,917 --> 01:39:14,042
What is All India Radio doing here?

1000
01:39:15,917 --> 01:39:18,001
These roads lead off the river

1001
01:39:18,917 --> 01:39:22,042
Place this over the map of Calcutta
and these routes lead to...

1002
01:39:22,542 --> 01:39:24,167
Fort William, the Governor's House

1003
01:39:24,542 --> 01:39:26,001
The dockyard, the Writers' building

1004
01:39:26,292 --> 01:39:27,417
The scum

1005
01:39:34,667 --> 01:39:37,917
"I'm taking Calcutta back," he said
when he took out my eyes

1006
01:39:40,292 --> 01:39:41,917
The rascal. The chameleon

1007
01:39:49,542 --> 01:39:51,376
This is a plan for a Japanese...

1008
01:39:51,792 --> 01:39:53,167
...attack of Calcutta

1009
01:39:55,792 --> 01:39:59,751
Yang Guang will give them
full access to Calcutta

1010
01:40:00,917 --> 01:40:04,167
If the Japanese know Yang Guang's
secret route...

1011
01:40:04,751 --> 01:40:05,917
...no one could stop them

1012
01:40:06,292 --> 01:40:09,042
How can a drug lord make
deals with an army?

1013
01:40:09,417 --> 01:40:12,167
The Japanese army deals in every
shady business

1014
01:40:13,001 --> 01:40:15,167
Opium. Heroin

1015
01:40:16,292 --> 01:40:19,167
Yang Guang goes back
a long way with them

1016
01:40:22,542 --> 01:40:25,417
We have little time before
Spring Day

1017
01:40:25,917 --> 01:40:27,042
Run if you can...

1018
01:40:28,042 --> 01:40:29,417
...Calcutta finish

1019
01:40:30,917 --> 01:40:33,667
Tomorrow is Spring Day.
They attack

1020
01:40:39,126 --> 01:40:41,251
When he came to Rangoon
from Shanghai...

1021
01:40:42,792 --> 01:40:44,792
...we should've killed him then

1022
01:40:45,417 --> 01:40:46,667
Big mistake

1023
01:40:47,376 --> 01:40:48,376
Very big mistake

1024
01:40:48,792 --> 01:40:50,042
Are you from Rangoon?

1025
01:40:50,917 --> 01:40:54,042
- Yang Guang came from Rangoon?
- The Sword of Rangoon

1026
01:40:56,792 --> 01:41:01,042
In Cantonese: Yang Guang Jian

1027
01:42:01,251 --> 01:42:02,876
What an actress you are

1028
01:42:04,667 --> 01:42:06,417
All that talk of love

1029
01:42:07,126 --> 01:42:09,417
Short on clothes. Long on sighs

1030
01:42:11,917 --> 01:42:15,251
When did you fall in love
with Yang Guang?

1031
01:42:19,917 --> 01:42:21,917
The day I first met him

1032
01:42:24,542 --> 01:42:26,417
I was only sixteen

1033
01:42:27,167 --> 01:42:30,417
Then you ran away with him and
came to Calcutta in 1931

1034
01:42:34,417 --> 01:42:36,542
I'd go anywhere if he asked me

1035
01:42:37,001 --> 01:42:40,042
And poison anyone if he asked you

1036
01:42:41,167 --> 01:42:43,042
You poisoned Sikdaar

1037
01:42:46,501 --> 01:42:48,792
The day I came by...

1038
01:42:51,042 --> 01:42:54,042
...you were feeding him soup

1039
01:42:55,126 --> 01:42:57,542
So you led me into the other room

1040
01:42:59,917 --> 01:43:03,042
To give the poison time to kill him

1041
01:43:07,292 --> 01:43:10,001
Four years ago he asked me...

1042
01:43:10,667 --> 01:43:12,792
...to wait for him. That's all

1043
01:43:16,292 --> 01:43:19,667
Since that day we've met hardly
four times

1044
01:43:25,876 --> 01:43:28,167
The day you went to Special
Branch to free Sikdaar...

1045
01:43:28,542 --> 01:43:30,667
I got a message. Kill him

1046
01:43:32,167 --> 01:43:35,542
That's the price for us being
together. I paid the price

1047
01:43:40,667 --> 01:43:43,251
I told you the first day, Byomkesh

1048
01:43:45,876 --> 01:43:46,917
Love and loyalty

1049
01:43:47,167 --> 01:43:48,167
This is neither love

1050
01:43:48,417 --> 01:43:49,667
Or loyalty

1051
01:43:50,542 --> 01:43:52,292
It's murder

1052
01:44:17,292 --> 01:44:20,167
He told me to watch out for you

1053
01:44:22,792 --> 01:44:25,792
Because if you thought I was hiding
something...

1054
01:44:26,042 --> 01:44:27,751
...you were bound to find it

1055
01:44:28,792 --> 01:44:30,376
Nothing escapes you

1056
01:44:33,167 --> 01:44:35,292
Yang Guang told you that?

1057
01:45:06,667 --> 01:45:08,667
You're risking your life, Byomkesh

1058
01:45:09,167 --> 01:45:11,542
The attack is in 5 hours. No choice

1059
01:45:12,167 --> 01:45:14,751
Tell the police. Don't go alone

1060
01:45:15,001 --> 01:45:18,792
If the police know, Sukumar and
his boys will face a firing squad

1061
01:45:27,251 --> 01:45:30,501
My man, Kanai, said you
saved his life

1062
01:45:31,542 --> 01:45:34,792
And that you could give me
Yang Guang

1063
01:45:35,501 --> 01:45:36,501
Yes

1064
01:45:37,542 --> 01:45:39,376
In return you must...

1065
01:45:41,126 --> 01:45:45,167
...blow every air raid siren
in Calcutta at 4 am

1066
01:45:45,917 --> 01:45:46,917
can you?

1067
01:45:47,126 --> 01:45:49,001
Good evening, Mr. Wilkie

1068
01:45:49,542 --> 01:45:51,792
- Good evening, sir
- What a splendid costume

1069
01:45:53,042 --> 01:45:55,542
It happens to be my uniform,
Lord Sen

1070
01:45:59,042 --> 01:46:01,667
Do you want Yang Guang or not?

1071
01:46:06,042 --> 01:46:09,792
The Calcutta police is not
some Chinese gang

1072
01:46:11,292 --> 01:46:13,542
We don't do deals

1073
01:46:14,876 --> 01:46:18,292
I always believed the Calcutta police
protected Calcutta

1074
01:46:28,292 --> 01:46:30,792
- I did what I could
- Which side are you on?

1075
01:46:31,292 --> 01:46:33,292
Hurry! There's no time

1076
01:46:33,917 --> 01:46:36,542
I owe you. What do you want me
to do?

1077
01:46:40,042 --> 01:46:43,042
"Dr. Guha, you asked me to join
your war

1078
01:46:43,876 --> 01:46:45,542
"Mustering the courage takes time

1079
01:46:46,042 --> 01:46:48,251
"Ajit has accepted his father's death

1080
01:46:48,792 --> 01:46:52,542
"Ajit is a loyal and brave man. That's
why I send this letter through him

1081
01:46:53,167 --> 01:46:56,042
"You've been betrayed.
Your plan is in jeopardy

1082
01:46:56,667 --> 01:47:00,917
"Leave the factory now
with Sukumar and Ajit

1083
01:47:01,667 --> 01:47:04,501
"I'll wait for you at the lodge.
I'll explain later

1084
01:47:04,876 --> 01:47:06,167
"Yours, Byomkesh"

1085
01:47:17,542 --> 01:47:20,542
Don't let anyone down
till I signal

1086
01:47:22,167 --> 01:47:24,542
Do you have your service pistol?

1087
01:47:26,751 --> 01:47:28,667
Byomkesh, has something changed?

1088
01:47:29,042 --> 01:47:31,042
Only everything

1089
01:47:35,667 --> 01:47:38,167
I need Mr. Wilkie's signature
to get the revolver

1090
01:47:38,667 --> 01:47:40,042
- Do you want...
- No

1091
01:47:41,751 --> 01:47:43,417
Just in case we get killed...

1092
01:47:43,792 --> 01:47:46,417
...when did you guess that
I was a cop?

1093
01:47:46,792 --> 01:47:47,917
Since Opium street

1094
01:47:48,126 --> 01:47:50,417
Before we got arrested, the
plainclothes cop asked...

1095
01:47:50,792 --> 01:47:53,917
...if I knew Ching Ling. When we
first met you asked that too

1096
01:47:54,376 --> 01:47:58,001
It's your secret code to identify
your undercover men

1097
01:47:58,501 --> 01:48:01,667
You knew but you didn't let on

1098
01:48:03,167 --> 01:48:05,126
I'm learning. Now go

1099
01:48:16,876 --> 01:48:20,126
Better late than never. I'm very happy

1100
01:48:20,792 --> 01:48:21,792
Very

1101
01:48:22,542 --> 01:48:23,876
Where are the others?

1102
01:48:24,042 --> 01:48:26,001
Gone home for the Spring Day break

1103
01:48:26,417 --> 01:48:29,751
- Your letter worried me
- I worry about you

1104
01:48:30,542 --> 01:48:31,876
Let's talk

1105
01:48:35,792 --> 01:48:39,042
I called you all here
for one reason

1106
01:48:40,417 --> 01:48:41,751
To tell you all...

1107
01:48:44,626 --> 01:48:45,667
...that you...

1108
01:48:48,667 --> 01:48:51,001
...have all been betrayed

1109
01:48:52,417 --> 01:48:53,792
Utterly betrayed

1110
01:48:55,251 --> 01:48:56,417
Betrayed?

1111
01:48:57,667 --> 01:48:58,917
How betrayed?

1112
01:49:00,126 --> 01:49:01,376
Betrayal No.1

1113
01:49:02,126 --> 01:49:07,376
Sukumar, what you take for your
fight for the country's freedom...

1114
01:49:07,667 --> 01:49:09,917
...it is not that at all

1115
01:49:11,792 --> 01:49:13,167
It's a drug deal

1116
01:49:14,876 --> 01:49:16,167
A heroin deal

1117
01:49:18,417 --> 01:49:20,042
Who betrayed us?

1118
01:49:21,626 --> 01:49:23,167
He has many names

1119
01:49:24,001 --> 01:49:26,042
Some say he's Chinese,
or Burmese

1120
01:49:26,292 --> 01:49:28,542
Some say he's dead,
others say he can't die

1121
01:49:28,751 --> 01:49:30,876
Demon. Devil. To me...

1122
01:49:32,042 --> 01:49:33,792
...he's an ordinary cheat

1123
01:49:34,501 --> 01:49:35,626
A traitor

1124
01:49:36,292 --> 01:49:37,542
A coward

1125
01:49:39,417 --> 01:49:40,542
Where is he?

1126
01:49:40,917 --> 01:49:41,917
Right here

1127
01:49:42,542 --> 01:49:43,626
Amongst us

1128
01:49:44,251 --> 01:49:45,417
Hiding

1129
01:49:47,542 --> 01:49:48,792
Betrayal No.2

1130
01:49:50,501 --> 01:49:51,626
Anguri Devi

1131
01:50:22,417 --> 01:50:23,917
You were betrayed too

1132
01:50:24,876 --> 01:50:27,917
The man who made you
another's mistress...

1133
01:50:28,251 --> 01:50:30,376
...made you lie and murder

1134
01:50:30,792 --> 01:50:34,751
The man who promised you'd
both leave Calcutta forever

1135
01:50:35,501 --> 01:50:38,042
That man is going nowhere.
He's staying right here

1136
01:50:40,001 --> 01:50:42,501
Sukumar, have you heard
of Yang Guang?

1137
01:50:44,042 --> 01:50:45,042
No

1138
01:50:47,126 --> 01:50:48,917
Before dying, my uncle...

1139
01:50:49,126 --> 01:50:51,126
Tried to tell me his name

1140
01:50:53,792 --> 01:50:57,417
Anguri Devi, have you heard
of Dr. Guha?

1141
01:51:03,001 --> 01:51:06,542
Amazing but you both know
him very well

1142
01:51:07,876 --> 01:51:10,542
The man you met only 4 times
in 4 years...

1143
01:51:10,917 --> 01:51:13,917
...is running a lodging house
3 miles away from you

1144
01:51:14,626 --> 01:51:17,042
Doling out medicine
to the poor

1145
01:51:18,042 --> 01:51:20,876
Your firebrand revolutionary guru...

1146
01:51:21,542 --> 01:51:24,792
...is a drug lord who's about to
make the deal of the century

1147
01:51:25,376 --> 01:51:28,876
While sending your boys to
their death

1148
01:51:29,126 --> 01:51:30,751
In the name of freedom

1149
01:51:33,417 --> 01:51:35,376
I don't know your real name

1150
01:51:36,126 --> 01:51:37,167
What shall I call you?

1151
01:51:37,626 --> 01:51:40,251
Yang Guang Jian?
The Sword of Rangoon?

1152
01:51:40,792 --> 01:51:42,667
Dr. Guha, the drug dealer?

1153
01:51:43,001 --> 01:51:44,001
Traitor

1154
01:51:44,667 --> 01:51:45,917
How about a cheat?

1155
01:51:53,917 --> 01:51:54,917
Bravo!

1156
01:52:01,876 --> 01:52:04,001
That was fun

1157
01:52:08,376 --> 01:52:09,417
Your hand

1158
01:52:12,417 --> 01:52:14,167
Give me your hand, Byomkesh

1159
01:52:22,917 --> 01:52:24,501
Puntiram, tea

1160
01:52:29,626 --> 01:52:31,376
Time for the truth, Doctor

1161
01:52:33,167 --> 01:52:37,667
The truth is that the people
sitting here, Mr. Bakshy...

1162
01:52:38,667 --> 01:52:40,126
...shan't live to see daybreak

1163
01:52:40,417 --> 01:52:41,751
Till then there's tea

1164
01:52:42,042 --> 01:52:43,167
Fried potatoes

1165
01:52:43,792 --> 01:52:46,876
And the story you're dying
to tell us

1166
01:52:47,751 --> 01:52:48,751
Go ahead

1167
01:52:50,626 --> 01:52:51,917
So the story goes...

1168
01:52:53,001 --> 01:52:55,667
Twelve years ago, the terror
of Shanghai

1169
01:52:56,042 --> 01:52:57,042
The drug dealer

1170
01:52:57,792 --> 01:53:01,001
Yang Guang comes to Calcutta
with his beautiful mistress

1171
01:53:02,542 --> 01:53:05,917
For eight years he rules over
South Asia from here

1172
01:53:06,626 --> 01:53:08,917
The Green Gang attack him
four years ago

1173
01:53:09,417 --> 01:53:11,667
They leave him for dead

1174
01:53:12,376 --> 01:53:14,001
That was some fight

1175
01:53:30,917 --> 01:53:34,917
Two months later, Dr. Guha buys
this lodging house

1176
01:53:35,417 --> 01:53:37,042
Puntiram, the recipes!

1177
01:53:37,792 --> 01:53:40,001
Bay leaves. Curry powder

1178
01:53:43,376 --> 01:53:44,376
Then?

1179
01:53:44,751 --> 01:53:46,167
You meet Bhuvan...

1180
01:53:46,792 --> 01:53:48,626
...who is mixing narcotics
with medicine

1181
01:53:49,126 --> 01:53:50,667
Then you both...

1182
01:53:51,417 --> 01:53:52,917
...make a plan together

1183
01:53:54,792 --> 01:53:56,167
I make the plan

1184
01:53:57,917 --> 01:53:58,917
Me

1185
01:54:01,417 --> 01:54:02,542
What plan? Tell

1186
01:54:03,167 --> 01:54:05,667
To cook a type of heroin...

1187
01:54:06,501 --> 01:54:07,792
...that's undetectable

1188
01:54:08,417 --> 01:54:11,876
Cook it in Sikdaar's factory
to avoid suspicion

1189
01:54:13,126 --> 01:54:15,167
A child could figure that out

1190
01:54:15,626 --> 01:54:17,167
Why? To what end?

1191
01:54:18,417 --> 01:54:19,417
I have a theory

1192
01:54:20,126 --> 01:54:22,001
Carry on. We're all ears

1193
01:54:26,251 --> 01:54:28,917
The Japanese want your heroin,
the Calcutta Kiss

1194
01:54:29,167 --> 01:54:31,917
And you, your drug empire

1195
01:54:32,501 --> 01:54:34,001
So you cut a deal

1196
01:54:34,376 --> 01:54:36,501
The Japanese attack Calcutta
on Spring Day...

1197
01:54:37,001 --> 01:54:38,876
...thanks to your opium route

1198
01:54:39,042 --> 01:54:42,292
Sikdaar forms the government
of Free Bengal

1199
01:54:43,626 --> 01:54:44,667
A puppet government

1200
01:54:45,126 --> 01:54:47,626
Under the control of
the Japanese and you

1201
01:54:49,417 --> 01:54:51,417
You export drugs openly

1202
01:54:52,042 --> 01:54:54,792
Calcutta becomes the world's
drug capital

1203
01:54:56,376 --> 01:54:59,417
You took this proposal to
the Japanese in Shanghai

1204
01:54:59,792 --> 01:55:01,376
Not a proposal

1205
01:55:03,542 --> 01:55:04,792
It's the future

1206
01:55:06,667 --> 01:55:07,667
Scum!

1207
01:55:12,626 --> 01:55:13,667
Spot on!

1208
01:55:16,792 --> 01:55:18,167
Perfect, isn't it?

1209
01:55:20,417 --> 01:55:21,417
No, sir

1210
01:55:22,292 --> 01:55:23,542
Not so perfect

1211
01:55:24,876 --> 01:55:26,792
You stole the Green Gang's
opium...

1212
01:55:27,042 --> 01:55:29,792
...to make heroin in Sikdaar's
factory

1213
01:55:30,917 --> 01:55:33,792
But perhaps you forgot to tell
Gajanan Sikdaar

1214
01:55:34,792 --> 01:55:37,792
Politicians! Yes, today.
No, tomorrow. Why risk it?

1215
01:55:40,167 --> 01:55:42,667
What happened between
you and Bhuvan?

1216
01:55:45,917 --> 01:55:47,501
What usually happens

1217
01:55:51,751 --> 01:55:52,876
Never mind

1218
01:55:53,917 --> 01:55:57,917
So Bhuvan goes to Anguri Devi's
flat to meet Sikdaar

1219
01:55:59,167 --> 01:56:01,167
He tells him what's going on
in his factory

1220
01:56:02,292 --> 01:56:05,126
Heroin manufacturing scares him.
He closes the factory

1221
01:56:06,167 --> 01:56:08,001
Gets bodyguards

1222
01:56:08,792 --> 01:56:11,417
But you gave your word
to the Japanese

1223
01:56:12,542 --> 01:56:14,167
The attack date was set

1224
01:56:14,626 --> 01:56:16,292
You incited Sukumar against Sikdaar

1225
01:56:17,792 --> 01:56:21,667
So the Party would split. You needed
volunteers for tomorrow

1226
01:56:25,126 --> 01:56:27,251
But no factory, plan collapses

1227
01:56:28,792 --> 01:56:29,792
Then?

1228
01:56:32,376 --> 01:56:34,876
Then I came into your life

1229
01:56:36,292 --> 01:56:38,167
My biggest weapon

1230
01:56:44,501 --> 01:56:46,292
The fool Byomkesh Bakshy

1231
01:56:47,542 --> 01:56:49,751
After I found Bhuvan's
paan box...

1232
01:56:50,042 --> 01:56:52,417
...you tried stopping me
by taking me...

1233
01:56:53,001 --> 01:56:54,001
...to the police station

1234
01:56:54,626 --> 01:56:57,667
Then you thought why not
kill two birds with one stone?

1235
01:56:58,251 --> 01:56:59,542
Throw me off

1236
01:57:00,042 --> 01:57:01,751
And repossess the factory

1237
01:57:02,167 --> 01:57:03,917
You cut out letters from
the newspaper...

1238
01:57:04,167 --> 01:57:06,417
...and framed Bhuvan as
the blackmailer

1239
01:57:07,501 --> 01:57:11,042
Sorry, I got the time wrong
on the stamp

1240
01:57:12,917 --> 01:57:14,376
I was in a hurry

1241
01:57:15,542 --> 01:57:19,542
Then you sent your secret weapon
to the factory to see me

1242
01:57:22,251 --> 01:57:24,876
Like tempting a dog with a bone

1243
01:57:25,667 --> 01:57:28,917
You dangled Anguri Devi
in front of Sikdaar...

1244
01:57:29,167 --> 01:57:30,542
...four years ago

1245
01:57:30,876 --> 01:57:32,542
You did the same with me

1246
01:57:32,792 --> 01:57:35,792
She pretended to hide the letters

1247
01:57:36,501 --> 01:57:38,001
Because I told you...

1248
01:57:38,542 --> 01:57:41,292
...that I always find what is hidden

1249
01:57:42,542 --> 01:57:45,001
After Sikdaar was dead, you sent
me the stamp...

1250
01:57:45,542 --> 01:57:47,001
...to confuse me

1251
01:57:47,751 --> 01:57:50,251
When I saw Watanabe, you appeared...

1252
01:57:50,667 --> 01:57:51,751
...as a freedom fighter

1253
01:57:52,001 --> 01:57:54,417
So Dr. Guha takes the blame

1254
01:57:54,792 --> 01:57:57,042
And Yang Guang is
never in the picture

1255
01:58:00,126 --> 01:58:02,167
We are tools for you

1256
01:58:03,126 --> 01:58:05,417
We do your dirty work

1257
01:58:09,001 --> 01:58:11,126
When I was your age...

1258
01:58:11,917 --> 01:58:13,001
...I was trusting too

1259
01:58:15,292 --> 01:58:17,001
You've learnt your lesson

1260
01:58:18,126 --> 01:58:21,417
You won't repeat
the same mistake

1261
01:58:26,792 --> 01:58:29,126
You didn't hear me right

1262
01:58:31,001 --> 01:58:34,126
You've forgotten. I said
you've all been betrayed

1263
01:58:35,001 --> 01:58:36,001
You, too

1264
01:58:38,251 --> 01:58:39,251
BY Whom?

1265
01:58:51,292 --> 01:58:52,292
By me

1266
01:58:59,667 --> 01:59:01,876
The river map for the attack

1267
01:59:04,167 --> 01:59:05,917
The police know everything

1268
01:59:08,167 --> 01:59:10,626
Wherever the Japanese will land...

1269
01:59:11,167 --> 01:59:12,792
...the army will welcome them

1270
01:59:16,376 --> 01:59:17,542
Our volunteers?

1271
01:59:25,667 --> 01:59:26,917
The police know everything

1272
01:59:27,792 --> 01:59:29,542
Except for your identity

1273
01:59:32,667 --> 01:59:35,501
Stop the attack and no one
will ever know

1274
01:59:42,167 --> 01:59:44,251
If the army knew...

1275
01:59:45,167 --> 01:59:47,001
...they'd already be here

1276
01:59:51,792 --> 01:59:53,501
You're bluffing

1277
02:00:08,417 --> 02:00:10,001
Let's kill the lot and go

1278
02:00:10,251 --> 02:00:11,251
No

1279
02:00:15,292 --> 02:00:18,626
Don't you know what a
Japanese attack means?

1280
02:00:18,917 --> 02:00:19,917
Darling

1281
02:00:20,667 --> 02:00:23,917
They destroyed my city,
my family. Everything

1282
02:00:24,292 --> 02:00:26,667
You knew that and still
hid it from me

1283
02:00:29,251 --> 02:00:30,876
Who gave you the right?

1284
02:00:31,042 --> 02:00:32,042
It's done

1285
02:00:32,792 --> 02:00:35,501
What's done is done

1286
02:00:36,417 --> 02:00:38,417
Whoever is to die
will now die

1287
02:00:43,792 --> 02:00:46,376
Stop the attack if you love me

1288
02:00:53,792 --> 02:00:55,292
Stop the attack

1289
02:01:00,626 --> 02:01:01,917
Would you shoot me?

1290
02:01:02,167 --> 02:01:03,626
Stop the attack!

1291
02:01:04,626 --> 02:01:06,126
Can you shoot me?

1292
02:01:07,167 --> 02:01:08,542
Do you love me or not?

1293
02:01:10,042 --> 02:01:11,042
Shoot

1294
02:01:17,042 --> 02:01:19,001
Do you love me or not?

1295
02:01:27,292 --> 02:01:28,876
Shoot, my love

1296
02:01:59,251 --> 02:02:01,001
Do you love me or not?

1297
02:02:03,751 --> 02:02:04,751
I do

1298
02:02:28,001 --> 02:02:29,042
What do you want?

1299
02:02:31,667 --> 02:02:33,251
To be together

1300
02:02:39,042 --> 02:02:40,167
To live together

1301
02:03:20,001 --> 02:03:21,001
Mr. Bakshy

1302
02:03:22,917 --> 02:03:24,417
The colour of truth?

1303
02:03:26,501 --> 02:03:27,626
Red

1304
02:03:33,542 --> 02:03:36,042
No one could sing like her

1305
02:03:44,626 --> 02:03:45,792
Should I kill you?

1306
02:03:47,292 --> 02:03:48,626
End it here

1307
02:04:14,667 --> 02:04:16,042
Too late, Doctor

1308
02:04:18,417 --> 02:04:19,542
Mr. Watanabe

1309
02:04:21,376 --> 02:04:23,167
That siren is for you

1310
02:04:25,001 --> 02:04:27,501
Your surprise attack has lost
its surprise

1311
02:04:27,876 --> 02:04:29,167
What will you do now?

1312
02:04:29,917 --> 02:04:32,542
Will you save your men
or let them die?

1313
02:04:33,292 --> 02:04:38,001
The army will be waiting for the
Japanese at every landing spot

1314
02:04:43,501 --> 02:04:44,501
Look up!

1315
02:04:45,292 --> 02:04:47,917
An enemy's enemy is a friend

1316
02:04:51,042 --> 02:04:52,417
My old friend!

1317
02:04:56,792 --> 02:04:58,792
I asked Dr. Guha to come here

1318
02:04:59,292 --> 02:05:01,626
I knew Yang Guang would show up,
so I called them

1319
02:05:02,167 --> 02:05:03,917
I want him alive

1320
02:05:05,251 --> 02:05:06,251
Mr. Watanabe

1321
02:05:06,876 --> 02:05:08,251
Stop the attack!

1322
02:05:09,251 --> 02:05:10,917
You have lost Calcutta

1323
02:05:26,126 --> 02:05:27,292
No one will stop him

1324
02:05:27,876 --> 02:05:29,126
You all promised

1325
02:05:55,376 --> 02:05:57,417
Why didn't you kill me sooner?

1326
02:06:26,042 --> 02:06:28,917
- Our volunteers will die
- I was bluffing

1327
02:06:29,292 --> 02:06:30,542
No one knows

1328
02:06:30,667 --> 02:06:31,792
I was bluffing

1329
02:06:32,001 --> 02:06:33,417
The police don't know

1330
02:06:33,626 --> 02:06:35,501
I just asked Wilkie to blow
the siren

1331
02:06:35,667 --> 02:06:36,751
Quiet!

1332
02:07:39,542 --> 02:07:40,292
Japanese...

1333
02:07:40,542 --> 02:07:42,417
It's 6 am. Everything is fine

1334
02:07:43,042 --> 02:07:44,542
No sound of firing

1335
02:07:49,042 --> 02:07:50,126
Dr. Guha?

1336
02:07:52,126 --> 02:07:54,042
The Green Gang took him

1337
02:07:57,042 --> 02:07:58,917
Thank Mr. Wilkie for me

1338
02:08:00,042 --> 02:08:03,417
If he raids the factory,
he may find the heroin

1339
02:08:04,376 --> 02:08:05,376
Go

1340
02:08:21,417 --> 02:08:22,917
I couldn't save her

1341
02:08:24,542 --> 02:08:26,126
You saved Calcutta, Byomkesh

1342
02:08:31,501 --> 02:08:35,292
I know your father was
a good man

1343
02:08:37,501 --> 02:08:40,001
He made the formula for fun

1344
02:08:40,667 --> 02:08:43,042
When he found out what
it could mean...

1345
02:08:43,376 --> 02:08:44,792
...he tried to stop it

1346
02:08:45,167 --> 02:08:48,417
It may also be - he fought with
Yang Guang over money

1347
02:08:49,417 --> 02:08:52,042
And went to tell Sikdaar
to rat on Yang Guang

1348
02:08:55,167 --> 02:08:56,167
Puntiram

1349
02:08:56,542 --> 02:08:58,292
The police must be on their way.
Make tea

1350
02:08:58,542 --> 02:08:59,542
With ginger?

1351
02:08:59,917 --> 02:09:00,917
Ginger

1352
02:09:02,042 --> 02:09:03,251
Wipe the blood

1353
02:09:03,542 --> 02:09:05,417
Don't touch a crime scene

1354
02:09:05,876 --> 02:09:07,542
Never mind the blood. Just tea

1355
02:09:07,917 --> 02:09:09,917
Let me get something to eat

1356
02:09:27,417 --> 02:09:30,501
You said if I helped your brother...

1357
02:09:31,042 --> 02:09:32,542
...you'd reward me

1358
02:09:34,501 --> 02:09:36,167
I saved him. See?

1359
02:09:38,417 --> 02:09:39,417
Reward?

1360
02:09:41,001 --> 02:09:42,001
Now?

1361
02:09:50,542 --> 02:09:53,542
Ajit is all I have. I'll become
a professional truth-seeker

1362
02:09:53,917 --> 02:09:55,292
I have no property. No bank...

1363
02:10:22,917 --> 02:10:24,417
A factory siren

1364
02:10:28,667 --> 02:10:30,542
- Dr. Guha?
- Forget it

1365
02:10:33,792 --> 02:10:36,501
Calcutta looks beautiful at dawn

1366
02:10:40,167 --> 02:10:41,167
Kill him

1367
02:10:44,376 --> 02:10:45,376
Go on

1368
02:10:48,626 --> 02:10:50,042
Avenge your father, son

1369
02:10:52,417 --> 02:10:54,042
- Kill him
- Relax

1370
02:10:55,251 --> 02:10:56,251
He's a kid

1371
02:10:56,751 --> 02:10:57,917
His hand trembles

1372
02:10:59,917 --> 02:11:00,917
His heart races

1373
02:11:01,167 --> 02:11:02,917
- Don't listen to him
- Hear me

1374
02:11:05,042 --> 02:11:06,167
Nothing to it

1375
02:11:06,792 --> 02:11:08,876
There's only the knife and my eye

1376
02:11:11,251 --> 02:11:12,251
Hold tight

1377
02:11:12,542 --> 02:11:13,542
Strike!

1378
02:12:03,751 --> 02:12:05,542
Between us...

1379
02:12:08,251 --> 02:12:10,751
...we have one eye left

1380
02:12:18,376 --> 02:12:21,792
...and one thing separates us

1381
02:12:26,542 --> 02:12:29,126
You will be forgotten

1382
02:12:51,917 --> 02:12:54,292
You couldn't take my love

1383
02:12:56,251 --> 02:12:59,167
How will you take my hate
