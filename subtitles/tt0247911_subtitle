1
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:16,390
''Gafoor ''''bhai'''', one minute...
Prakash has been shot''

2
00:03:16,796 --> 00:03:18,593
What are you saying?

3
00:03:26,773 --> 00:03:27,933
Pratap...

4
00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:32,111
Prakash has been killed

5
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:58,035
''l want names! Who was there?
Who shot him, who took him out''

6
00:03:58,638 --> 00:04:04,099
l want every detail. Now.
- We'll find out everything

7
00:04:04,677 --> 00:04:08,636
''They shouldn't have started it.
- You started it all, Raman''

8
00:04:09,682 --> 00:04:16,087
''l told you, not to mess
with Kanya Pathan. lt's his area''

9
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:19,387
Why send our men in?
- Why not?

10
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:24,286
''lf he can invade our territory,
why can't we? Enough Uncle Gafoor''

11
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:27,597
l'm going to teach him a lesson!
- Shut up

12
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:39,401
''Keep that lesson for later.
First, call the commissioner''

13
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:46,114
Prakash was one of my best men.
We should claim his body

14
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:52,056
''To claim the body, we got to tell
the police that he was our man...''

15
00:04:52,592 --> 00:04:59,794
Then tell them he's our man! Not a dog
on the streets. He was a son to me

16
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:07,834
His family should get his dead body.
l will perform his last rites

17
00:05:09,742 --> 00:05:11,039
Papa...

18
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:36,926
Yes go on

19
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:41,638
''Found out?
One minute... Raman ''''bhai''''''

20
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:53,145
You stay right there. l'll kill four
of them for one of us or l'm no Raman

21
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:55,654
Bastards! They killed Prakash

22
00:05:58,057 --> 00:06:00,958
What are you doing over there?
Go to your room

23
00:06:16,008 --> 00:06:17,236
What happened?

24
00:06:19,645 --> 00:06:22,375
Nisha! l'm so scared

25
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:25,580
The killings have started again

26
00:06:27,286 --> 00:06:28,981
Hush my baby

27
00:06:38,831 --> 00:06:42,665
''Stays over there.
Salim says, he shot Prakash''

28
00:06:55,415 --> 00:07:00,216
Hey disco! Drop dead.
Shut it out

29
00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:09,593
Hey, partying in there?''

30
00:07:13,332 --> 00:07:14,526
Moron...

31
00:07:15,568 --> 00:07:18,332
Open up, roll down the glass''

32
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:21,539
Smart ass, you don't get it?''

33
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:29,380
Let go of me

34
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:34,779
Leave me

35
00:07:42,361 --> 00:07:44,090
Killed my Prakash

36
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:49,092
My Prakash.
- He's dead

37
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:51,603
Leave me.
- Get in the car

38
00:07:52,004 --> 00:07:56,600
''Enough Raman ''''bhai''''.
Get inside''

39
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:13,592
How did this happen?
- What could we do?

40
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,251
Oould l die in his stead?
- Killed him

41
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:22,930
You think we don't regret it?
You aren't the only one who mourns him

42
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:28,263
''He killed Prakash,
on Kanya Pathan's say-so''

43
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:31,641
Prakash! He meant more to me
than a brother

44
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:37,240
l killed his assassin like a dog.
Killed him myself

45
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:44,219
Your revenge won't bring him back.
Said he'd be back in half an hour

46
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:49,684
Little did l know it was the last time
l was seeing him

47
00:08:50,229 --> 00:08:54,666
She simply won't understand!
What can we do?

48
00:09:09,081 --> 00:09:14,246
How long will this go on?

49
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:20,589
Take your mind off these things

50
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:25,929
Go back to your studies

51
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:32,971
Studies? Education is what
you go to school for

52
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:40,611
l've never seen a school.
ls this any life?

53
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:45,879
l can't even go anywhere

54
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:56,322
''How long am l to sit in this cage,
watching forever? So mindlessly?''

55
00:10:00,566 --> 00:10:05,902
Silly, you won't be here forever''

56
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:10,675
ln this house, you're a guest''

57
00:10:11,644 --> 00:10:15,239
''ln a little while,
there will come a prince''

58
00:10:16,682 --> 00:10:18,877
And he will open
the door of the cage...

59
00:10:19,852 --> 00:10:23,811
and he will carry you away
with pomp and splendour

60
00:15:22,621 --> 00:15:27,183
''We have the thing in us,
that's rare''''''

61
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:29,661
We shall win the world

62
00:15:42,808 --> 00:15:47,211
We keep the world in our pockets

63
00:15:47,746 --> 00:15:49,714
We're special

64
00:16:48,307 --> 00:16:50,241
We're straight-arrows

65
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:56,137
We set the bad men right

66
00:16:58,217 --> 00:17:00,208
We're good at heart

67
00:17:00,619 --> 00:17:05,989
We turn devils into humans

68
00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:15,232
We make stones talk

69
00:18:28,574 --> 00:18:32,908
When the waves are on fire...

70
00:18:33,412 --> 00:18:37,644
the ocean cannot douse it

71
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:42,944
When youth kicks up a storm...

72
00:18:43,489 --> 00:18:47,653
no one can stop it

73
00:18:53,699 --> 00:18:55,667
But where's the storm?

74
00:19:08,747 --> 00:19:12,444
''We have the thing in us,
that's rare''''''

75
00:19:13,685 --> 00:19:15,585
We shall win the world

76
00:20:33,832 --> 00:20:35,322
Rohit come on

77
00:20:35,701 --> 00:20:37,134
Let's get lost

78
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:48,106
Get the girl

79
00:22:16,101 --> 00:22:18,399
Got to be somewhere around.
- Got to find them

80
00:22:18,804 --> 00:22:22,399
''Don't let her escape.
- No way, come on''

81
00:22:22,874 --> 00:22:25,843
Hack her to pieces

82
00:22:27,379 --> 00:22:31,440
Go that way...
- Don't let her escape

83
00:23:51,696 --> 00:23:53,425
We're here

84
00:23:57,502 --> 00:23:58,469
Leave her

85
00:24:33,071 --> 00:24:38,304
Now stop staring and talk.
- She was a childhood friend

86
00:24:39,411 --> 00:24:42,710
lf she didn't attend her wedding...
- Don't you interfere

87
00:24:44,783 --> 00:24:49,152
With whose permission
did you go out?

88
00:24:50,088 --> 00:24:52,215
Will you talk?

89
00:25:00,031 --> 00:25:01,123
Sapna...

90
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:03,801
come to me

91
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,248
Why did you leave
without telling me?

92
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:23,116
What if something happened?

93
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:29,590
''By numbers, your father has more
enemies than the days you've lived''

94
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:36,590
Your life and my prestige matters less
than a friend's wedding?

95
00:25:42,674 --> 00:25:48,374
''From now on, you will not
step out of this house''

96
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:51,644
You hear?

97
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:56,718
Go to your room. Go

98
00:26:00,525 --> 00:26:05,861
''lt's all your fault. You knew she's
going out, yet you didn't stop her?''

99
00:26:06,364 --> 00:26:12,599
''Get this clear. lf anything happens
to my sister, you're dead''

100
00:26:13,672 --> 00:26:18,575
And you... come here. With whose
permission did you take out the car?

101
00:26:24,616 --> 00:26:26,584
This time Kanya has crossed the limit

102
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,019
Kill him

103
00:26:30,555 --> 00:26:36,391
More important is
anticipating his next move

104
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:44,599
''ln our business, one man's weakness
is another man's strength''

105
00:26:46,671 --> 00:26:53,600
Kanya has set his eyes on my weakness.
So l must get rid of my weakness

106
00:26:56,448 --> 00:27:01,579
What do you mean?
- Talk to Hasmukh Patel in London

107
00:27:05,357 --> 00:27:08,918
Say that his best friend
wants to talk to him

108
00:27:10,528 --> 00:27:14,658
Tell him to drop everything
and come over with his son

109
00:27:17,035 --> 00:27:20,698
l want to finalise the match
between Sapna and Rishabh

110
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:29,378
l want my daughter to get married
and go someplace far away

111
00:27:31,616 --> 00:27:35,245
''Bullets flying,
just like in Hindi films''

112
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:41,156
''But l wasn't about to be put off.
l heard the girl, l got off my bike''

113
00:27:41,626 --> 00:27:46,154
''l told her, ''''Let me take care of it''
And right into battle...''

114
00:27:46,631 --> 00:27:52,092
''One minute, our hero Rohit doesn't seem
to figure in your story. Wrong story''

115
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:56,607
''Regrettable, there was no sight of him.
At the sight of guns being drawn...''

116
00:27:57,142 --> 00:28:00,168
''he was away, like a bullet!
l was the one...''

117
00:28:00,612 --> 00:28:02,375
Shut up!
- Wasn't l there?

118
00:28:02,614 --> 00:28:08,075
We were scared shit when we heard
the shooting. Rohit was the one

119
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:10,588
Risked his life, took them on''

120
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:11,945
''The girl got away, but looks like
our man is framed''

121
00:29:14,152 --> 00:29:20,148
Murderous assault
on Pratap Dholakia's daughter fails

122
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:27,597
Oar ambushed on Link Road
at 1 1 :30 pm last night

123
00:29:33,404 --> 00:29:35,099
What's wrong with you?

124
00:29:49,387 --> 00:29:53,323
''Now l have the name and address,
l got to figure out how to see her''

125
00:29:54,859 --> 00:29:58,920
Brake man brake.
You know who Dholakia is?

126
00:29:59,397 --> 00:30:01,888
''Yes, who?
- Drummer, like Sandy?''

127
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:06,666
No, he's an underworld don''

128
00:30:07,205 --> 00:30:11,232
Don? So no love.
Your life-story...

129
00:30:11,743 --> 00:30:14,906
''seems to be heading straight towards
The End right after ''''The Beginning''''''

130
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:18,747
''The end, no sooner than you've begun.
- Don't talk rot''

131
00:30:19,217 --> 00:30:22,050
Who's finished?
- Look at this

132
00:30:24,422 --> 00:30:29,655
''Dholakia? l've performed at
his residence, with our troupe''

133
00:30:30,595 --> 00:30:32,153
Why the brow-beating?

134
00:30:37,402 --> 00:30:40,166
ldea!
- About what?

135
00:30:40,738 --> 00:30:43,229
l got to see Sapna.
- Who's Sapna?

136
00:30:43,741 --> 00:30:46,471
Dholakia's daughter.
- Why are you seeing her?

137
00:30:46,978 --> 00:30:50,243
l saw her once and l've lost my sleep

138
00:30:51,749 --> 00:30:56,709
l see! Next time you won't wake up

139
00:30:57,222 --> 00:31:01,716
Dad will put you off to sleep for good.
- Sandy! Listen to me

140
00:31:02,393 --> 00:31:08,855
''All l want is an introduction.
- At first sight, they kill. Forget it''

141
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:20,637
The festival is two days away.
The exams are two months away

142
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:27,641
''Even without your help, l'll find her.
Without mine, you'll never make grade''

143
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:36,657
''You'll end up back in your farm,
riding a tractor. Understand?''

144
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:42,662
l'd rather drive a tractor
than get shot

145
00:31:43,201 --> 00:31:47,069
''l'm not falling for you.
- Sandy, listen. What a friend?''

146
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:54,507
Listen to me...

147
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:01,981
l'm begging. At your feet

148
00:32:04,389 --> 00:32:07,654
''With you at my feet,
l'll end up without a head''

149
00:32:08,493 --> 00:32:09,289
Okay, l'll try to fix you''

150
00:32:33,851 --> 00:32:38,447
''Sandy, any sight of her?
- l'm as good as blind''

151
00:33:00,678 --> 00:33:06,776
''Mother Goddess, like every year,
protect us on this sacred day''

152
00:33:10,888 --> 00:33:18,056
Bless us that we may celebrate
these nine nights

153
00:33:21,532 --> 00:33:24,399
Say glory to The Mother Goddess.
- Glory be

154
00:34:02,673 --> 00:34:06,973
Why did you leave?
- The prayers are over

155
00:34:07,979 --> 00:34:11,142
The fun isn't over

156
00:34:11,682 --> 00:34:17,348
''You go on, l don't feel like it.
- Just come along, you'll enjoy it''

157
00:34:18,623 --> 00:34:20,716
''ln the whole year, these
are the only nine days...''

158
00:34:21,092 --> 00:34:23,253
when we can socialise
without any reservations

159
00:34:23,628 --> 00:34:29,089
''We can talk, we can sing, dance.
- Go on, l've got a headache''

160
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:33,397
As you wish

161
00:35:20,751 --> 00:35:24,152
''Sapna, where are you going?
- To the dance''

162
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:26,590
''ln the whole year, these
are the only nine days...''

163
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:29,256
when we can socialise
without any reservations

164
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:32,289
''We can talk, we can sing, dance.
- Your headache?''

165
00:35:32,697 --> 00:35:33,755
lt's gone

166
00:36:20,778 --> 00:36:25,374
''Hi Sapna, where have you been?
- We've been looking for you''

167
00:37:00,618 --> 00:37:02,245
Want to dance?

168
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:05,378
Want to dance

169
00:37:44,629 --> 00:37:51,000
''See? lntroduction scene begins.
- lf Daddy sees, direct climax''

170
00:37:56,841 --> 00:37:59,401
''For that night, thanks.
- For tonight, thanks''

171
00:38:10,388 --> 00:38:13,380
''You work in the band?
- Had to, for you''

172
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:15,315
Daddy is calling

173
00:39:15,286 --> 00:39:20,246
This is too much! Did you
have to repair that geyser?

174
00:39:21,759 --> 00:39:25,593
That geyser was all that was left
and you've destroyed it too?

175
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:29,599
Why try to repair it yourself?
l just don't understand

176
00:39:34,739 --> 00:39:38,402
Good you're here. See for yourself
what antics your Papa is upto

177
00:39:38,843 --> 00:39:42,210
''Sends you to study engineering, takes
a fancy to opening up anything at home''

178
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:46,776
''Tv, refrigerator, fans, the cooler,
he has taken everything apart''

179
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:50,984
''Only thing left is the old radio
and all day, l'm either...''

180
00:39:51,355 --> 00:39:53,653
hearing silly songs or watching
your father's face. Hobson's choice

181
00:39:54,392 --> 00:40:00,353
Wrong. There's also 24 hours
BBO World Service on radio

182
00:40:00,865 --> 00:40:06,667
''And in 25 years, your Papa
never found a way to repair that''

183
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:11,675
Must you do all this?
- Forget it. Oome on

184
00:40:16,347 --> 00:40:22,650
Here on a Wednesday morning instead
of Saturday evening... how come?

185
00:40:24,288 --> 00:40:28,987
l was missing Mom's cooking

186
00:40:37,568 --> 00:40:41,231
You haven't been here for quite 2 hours
and you want to leave already?

187
00:40:41,739 --> 00:40:44,867
We haven't even had
a heart-to-heart talk

188
00:40:45,476 --> 00:40:47,706
Here's food for your friends

189
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:50,375
ln this on, fries''

190
00:40:50,714 --> 00:40:52,375
And sweets

191
00:40:52,883 --> 00:40:54,783
Mango pickle

192
00:40:55,419 --> 00:40:59,378
''And this is honey.
Every morning, with lime...''

193
00:41:00,391 --> 00:41:05,328
This is more like
a daughter's dowry

194
00:41:05,696 --> 00:41:09,257
''How will he carry all this?
Oome on son, l'll drop you''

195
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:11,668
Why isn't this closing?
- l'll take care of it

196
00:41:12,837 --> 00:41:14,805
You better run before
she packs some more

197
00:41:15,573 --> 00:41:16,972
Take care

198
00:41:24,081 --> 00:41:25,013
Bye

199
00:41:27,184 --> 00:41:32,212
Leaving without saying
what you came to say?

200
00:41:37,761 --> 00:41:42,994
l'm Daddy. l reared you.
Even before you start talking...

201
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:49,804
''l knew what you wanted. Even now,
l don't need words to make out''

202
00:41:51,742 --> 00:41:58,238
''When l embraced you, l knew.
Who's the girl?''

203
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:07,646
Sapna. (Sapna :Dream)
- Turn that dream into a reality. Quick

204
00:42:11,762 --> 00:42:12,990
But...

205
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:22,162
Quandary was always part of romance.
The but always butts in between lovers

206
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:31,337
ln some form or the other.
But the winner in love...

207
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:35,776
is one who bulldozes every wall
that stands in the way

208
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:40,786
''Hearten to it son,
jump into the fray''

209
00:43:16,527 --> 00:43:19,985
O'dear, sneak away...''

210
00:43:20,497 --> 00:43:23,591
it's time to become one

211
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:29,599
Oh that gaze

212
00:43:30,174 --> 00:43:33,439
My heart's on a song

213
00:44:17,121 --> 00:44:21,581
A smile rejoices on her lips

214
00:44:26,797 --> 00:44:31,393
l'm swept in the river of love

215
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:40,874
When the clouds shower down elixir...

216
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:45,645
why must l remain thirsty?

217
00:44:54,858 --> 00:44:58,350
Oh what spell have you cast?

218
00:44:58,862 --> 00:45:02,593
lt draws me closer to you

219
00:45:04,635 --> 00:45:08,127
''O my love, sneak away,
come to me''''''

220
00:45:08,672 --> 00:45:12,267
lt's time to become one

221
00:45:14,478 --> 00:45:17,845
Oh that gaze...

222
00:45:18,348 --> 00:45:21,579
makes music within me

223
00:46:26,183 --> 00:46:27,377
Your earrings...

224
00:46:28,152 --> 00:46:29,585
chime...

225
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:31,910
My heart...

226
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:34,352
skips a beat

227
00:46:34,725 --> 00:46:38,752
My heart l have given to you

228
00:46:39,296 --> 00:46:42,595
Don't break it

229
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:44,931
Your earrings...

230
00:46:45,736 --> 00:46:47,601
chime

231
00:47:23,473 --> 00:47:27,068
The spark on your spurs

232
00:47:27,611 --> 00:47:31,570
Your capers can be killing

233
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:40,579
''lt's a moment of frolic,
let me make the most of it''''''

234
00:47:40,991 --> 00:47:45,087
''Say nothing,
let me make you dance''''''

235
00:47:45,629 --> 00:47:49,292
''ln this night of festivity,
you stand out''''''

236
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:53,361
''And l'm with you,
l have you''''''

237
00:47:54,404 --> 00:47:55,598
Your earrings...

238
00:47:56,607 --> 00:47:57,596
chime

239
00:47:58,675 --> 00:48:00,199
My heart...

240
00:48:00,777 --> 00:48:02,574
skips a beat

241
00:48:03,347 --> 00:48:06,908
''Now that l have given
my heart to you...''''''

242
00:48:07,417 --> 00:48:10,875
do not break it

243
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:18,247
''That hip-hop trip
sends me into a tailspin''''''

244
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:20,385
l'm transfixed!

245
00:49:20,757 --> 00:49:23,988
''Oh not thatjig,
you're shaking up the world''''''

246
00:49:24,428 --> 00:49:25,395
One...

247
00:49:25,762 --> 00:49:26,786
two...

248
00:49:27,564 --> 00:49:28,588
three...

249
00:49:29,333 --> 00:49:30,595
four

250
00:49:31,101 --> 00:49:33,934
''You're stunning,
don't drive us insane''''''

251
00:49:34,338 --> 00:49:37,398
Lass, you're beyond compare''

252
00:52:45,262 --> 00:52:46,991
Who are you messing with?

253
00:52:47,697 --> 00:52:49,324
''You know who you're messing with?
- No brother, don't''

254
00:52:49,699 --> 00:52:51,667
''You know whose sister she is?
- Listen to me, a minute...''

255
00:52:52,702 --> 00:52:57,662
''Please, listen...
- Are you trying to fool me?''

256
00:53:12,556 --> 00:53:13,716
My mistake

257
00:53:15,325 --> 00:53:18,920
Maybe l failed to teach my child how
to differentiate between good and bad

258
00:53:20,630 --> 00:53:25,693
You raised your hand against
the man who saved my daughter?

259
00:53:28,004 --> 00:53:33,169
''Now stop staring and apologise.
- Sorry, hitting you was a mistake''

260
00:53:33,677 --> 00:53:38,637
''On the contrary, all for the better.
Had it been a gun instead...''

261
00:53:40,684 --> 00:53:43,414
l wouldn't have had a chance
to thank you

262
00:53:46,823 --> 00:53:48,984
What is your name?
- Rohit

263
00:53:49,693 --> 00:53:50,990
Look Rohit...

264
00:53:52,696 --> 00:53:58,134
l can never repay you
for the favour you have done me...

265
00:53:59,703 --> 00:54:05,335
''in saving my beloved daughter.
Still, here's a small gift''

266
00:54:07,844 --> 00:54:12,781
''No! This isn't necessary.
- Keep it son, it's a heartfelt gift''

267
00:54:13,450 --> 00:54:15,350
l don't mean to break his heart

268
00:54:18,321 --> 00:54:20,152
But you must accept something

269
00:54:24,761 --> 00:54:30,256
''ln that case, there is something.
- What...?''

270
00:54:35,171 --> 00:54:39,267
''Actually, it began at the festival.
Let me explain...''

271
00:54:40,543 --> 00:54:43,637
l hope you won't mind...
- Begun? What?

272
00:54:46,683 --> 00:54:48,844
''l don't know, l've never talked about
these things''

273
00:54:51,655 --> 00:54:55,853
''l'll try, but you won't mind...?
- He won't. Just say it''

274
00:54:56,860 --> 00:54:58,987
lt's all because of
the seven o'clock class

275
00:54:59,396 --> 00:55:02,388
''Now the band isn't ours,
lmran runs it''

276
00:55:02,766 --> 00:55:06,998
''And lmran is no one's man. Show ends,
he pockets his money and he's gone''

277
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:11,167
''That leaves us stranded, trying to
get back to the hostel at midnight''

278
00:55:11,675 --> 00:55:15,304
''No problem for me, l have a bike.
And Akhilesh hitches a ride with me''

279
00:55:15,745 --> 00:55:19,909
''That leaves Nilesh, Madhu and Sandy.
- You want them out of the band?''

280
00:55:20,350 --> 00:55:22,318
''No! lf they're out, the band
is finished''

281
00:55:22,686 --> 00:55:26,247
''Problem is, l can't ditch them.
So l reach the bus stop''

282
00:55:26,623 --> 00:55:31,060
''By then, the last bus is gone
and it's a hopeless situation''

283
00:55:31,428 --> 00:55:33,589
The night service is only once
in two hours

284
00:55:34,097 --> 00:55:39,057
''So we start walking and a little
way along, we're hungry. Not me...''

285
00:55:39,436 --> 00:55:42,872
''but Nilesh, Madhu and Sandy
are hungry. Therefore, omelettes''

286
00:55:43,306 --> 00:55:46,935
''Looking for omelettes, son?
- No, two vendors are right there''

287
00:55:47,410 --> 00:55:53,645
''One uses oil, the other uses butter.
The oil hurts. Butter is expensive''

288
00:55:54,217 --> 00:55:57,448
''Looking for butter?
- Oome on, we can afford that''

289
00:55:57,887 --> 00:56:01,050
But an autorickshaw ride back to
the hostel is what we can't afford

290
00:56:01,424 --> 00:56:05,588
The cabbies demand return fares.
By the time we're back in the hostel...

291
00:56:05,962 --> 00:56:11,923
it's five am. Not my problem. l can be
up by six o'clock. But the others...

292
00:56:12,302 --> 00:56:14,395
''Nilesh, Madhu and...
- Sandy''

293
00:56:15,605 --> 00:56:18,699
They miss the class at seven

294
00:56:20,610 --> 00:56:24,979
So you want a taxi to drop you
afterwards?

295
00:56:25,482 --> 00:56:30,351
''Not taxi. Autorickshaw. l got a bike.
For the others, you know...''

296
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:33,380
Nilesh, Madhu and Sandy''

297
00:56:46,803 --> 00:56:48,168
Strange guy

298
00:56:50,473 --> 00:56:54,842
''Friends apart, you want nothing
for yourself?''

299
00:56:57,814 --> 00:57:02,251
You saved my daughter's life.
You must accept something

300
00:57:03,286 --> 00:57:06,187
lt's enough for me if my friends
are provided for

301
00:57:06,623 --> 00:57:10,684
''As for your daughter,
is there any price to her life?''

302
00:57:12,629 --> 00:57:14,324
You speak very well

303
00:57:14,664 --> 00:57:17,531
''Picked it up from my parents, sir.
They aren't in town. But l'm here''

304
00:57:17,901 --> 00:57:21,132
''National Oollege, Boys Hostel.
2nd floor, 428''

305
00:57:21,604 --> 00:57:25,700
You can also leave a message with
Shetty on 84-84-448. Easy to remember

306
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:31,808
''lf you're ever passing by,
do drop in. l'd appreciate that''

307
00:57:35,318 --> 00:57:39,049
You never keep an account of who's
eating what? Want to send me packing?

308
00:57:39,422 --> 00:57:42,585
''What's this, a free-for-all?
Wait, l'm coming''

309
00:57:48,431 --> 00:57:49,398
Yes, go on''

310
00:57:49,632 --> 00:57:52,533
Oan l talk to Rohit?
- Who Rohit? Who are you?

311
00:57:52,936 --> 00:57:58,067
l'm Sapna.
- Which... you mean Rohit's dream?

312
00:57:59,943 --> 00:58:04,243
''l'm Shetty, Rohit's best friend.
Hold on, l'll call him''

313
00:58:04,614 --> 00:58:08,209
Oall Rohit. Sapna is calling.
- Okay

314
00:58:08,618 --> 00:58:09,585
Hurry

315
00:58:10,286 --> 00:58:12,151
Kulkarni...
- Yes?

316
00:58:12,622 --> 00:58:16,456
lt's Sapna on Shetty's line.
Tell Rohit to hurry

317
00:58:16,893 --> 00:58:18,588
Jacob...
- Yes?

318
00:58:18,962 --> 00:58:20,930
Shetty and Sapna are on line.
Tell Rohit

319
00:58:21,231 --> 00:58:22,220
Vishal...
- Yes?

320
00:58:22,632 --> 00:58:25,192
Shetty is angling for Sapna.
Tell Rohit to hurry

321
00:58:25,635 --> 00:58:28,331
''Mohit, tell Rohit!
Shetty is trying to woo Sapna''

322
00:58:29,138 --> 00:58:32,130
''Rohit, come quick!
Shetty is trying to woo Sapna''

323
00:59:01,804 --> 00:59:02,930
Yes Sapna

324
00:59:03,907 --> 00:59:05,397
What...?

325
00:59:06,409 --> 00:59:07,842
One second

326
00:59:11,681 --> 00:59:12,613
One second...

327
00:59:16,719 --> 00:59:20,382
''Yes Sapna, lots of disturbances here.
One second...''

328
00:59:28,798 --> 00:59:34,395
''Yes, so what were you saying?
- l haven't said anything yet''

329
00:59:41,678 --> 00:59:46,342
''So say it now.
- l can't talk like you, can l?''

330
00:59:49,085 --> 00:59:50,814
You can always tell me

331
00:59:54,557 --> 00:59:55,649
Tell me...

332
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:01,420
''of late, like me, you haven't
been sleeping too?''

333
01:00:05,868 --> 01:00:06,835
Yes

334
01:00:08,738 --> 01:00:13,368
Like me, you've lost appetite too?''

335
01:00:15,678 --> 01:00:16,610
Yes

336
01:00:16,713 --> 01:00:18,977
''When you shut your eyes,
you can see me?''

337
01:00:20,683 --> 01:00:21,650
Yes

338
01:00:22,385 --> 01:00:27,322
You wish we could talk face-to-face?
There's so much to talk about

339
01:00:28,691 --> 01:00:29,658
Yes

340
01:00:30,693 --> 01:00:33,184
''But not in a crowd.
Somewhere, in solitude...''

341
01:00:36,432 --> 01:00:41,665
where only you and l will be?
lsn't that so?

342
01:00:42,405 --> 01:00:43,337
Yes

343
01:00:44,807 --> 01:00:46,240
Then, tonight?''

344
01:00:49,679 --> 01:00:50,703
Yes

345
01:01:30,687 --> 01:01:33,451
Terrace

346
01:02:02,385 --> 01:02:05,218
''Everything all right, Uncle?
- Yes''

347
01:02:05,688 --> 01:02:07,713
Say hi to Aunt.
- Sure

348
01:02:08,958 --> 01:02:10,653
Who was that?

349
01:03:03,446 --> 01:03:04,811
What happened?

350
01:03:09,685 --> 01:03:11,084
What are you looking for?

351
01:03:11,454 --> 01:03:14,981
Your smile, l'm looking for it''

352
01:03:26,836 --> 01:03:27,928
Found it

353
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:41,172
You're lovely when you smile

354
01:03:42,385 --> 01:03:46,321
l like it when you make me laugh

355
01:04:36,606 --> 01:04:38,267
My heart is pounding, Rohit''

356
01:04:42,378 --> 01:04:44,141
l'm afraid

357
01:04:46,716 --> 01:04:48,650
Go away from here

358
01:05:00,363 --> 01:05:04,925
''Very well, if it rests your fears,
l will go away''

359
01:05:38,334 --> 01:05:40,131
How do l say...?

360
01:05:40,703 --> 01:05:43,638
''Don't leave me now...
not tonight, not ever''

361
01:05:53,883 --> 01:05:58,650
''l'm not afraid of you,
l'm afraid you'll leave me''

362
01:05:59,689 --> 01:06:02,590
''l'm afraid, what if
l start missing you?''

363
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:07,591
''l know, after these nine days
are over...''

364
01:06:08,631 --> 01:06:10,360
and afterwards...

365
01:06:10,866 --> 01:06:14,165
neither will you be able
to come here...

366
01:06:14,570 --> 01:06:17,038
nor will l be able
to escape this cage

367
01:06:34,557 --> 01:06:36,991
The lock to this cage
was sprung...

368
01:06:38,627 --> 01:06:40,595
the very night when we met
for the first time

369
01:06:42,698 --> 01:06:48,068
''You don't see it, because you're
used to living in this cage''

370
01:06:50,706 --> 01:06:55,643
''Look at it from my point, Sapna.
The cage is pen''

371
01:06:58,080 --> 01:07:02,574
You only need learn how to fly.
And l'll teach you that

372
01:07:05,354 --> 01:07:07,584
''l'll never let go
of your hand, Sapna''

373
01:07:09,191 --> 01:07:13,787
''Not now, not tonight,
not ever''

374
01:08:26,435 --> 01:08:27,732
Three words

375
01:08:28,604 --> 01:08:30,037
ln Hindi

376
01:08:30,773 --> 01:08:31,762
First word

377
01:08:35,678 --> 01:08:37,612
The lover will carry
his bridegroom away

378
01:08:38,547 --> 01:08:39,639
No...?

379
01:08:46,589 --> 01:08:48,181
Lose your heart

380
01:08:50,759 --> 01:08:54,456
What can l do?
l can't get anything

381
01:09:06,842 --> 01:09:09,970
''This isn't a movie,
this is life''

382
01:09:12,515 --> 01:09:15,575
''This isn't a story,
it's true''

383
01:09:16,752 --> 01:09:20,586
''Then you tell me the truth,
for l'm but a dream''

384
01:10:05,267 --> 01:10:09,704
But where do we sit?
There isn't a single table empty

385
01:10:16,679 --> 01:10:18,306
What's the matter Rohit?

386
01:10:19,682 --> 01:10:21,445
Are you all right?

387
01:10:23,586 --> 01:10:28,819
''What's happening to you, Rohit?
Are you all right?''

388
01:10:36,131 --> 01:10:37,792
What's wrong with you?

389
01:10:41,437 --> 01:10:42,665
Sit, sit''

390
01:10:45,441 --> 01:10:47,375
What's happening to you
all of a sudden?

391
01:10:48,744 --> 01:10:50,678
Are you all right?

392
01:10:54,750 --> 01:10:56,843
Eat.
- Weren't you puking?

393
01:10:57,353 --> 01:10:58,820
l'm fine now

394
01:11:02,691 --> 01:11:03,885
You mean...?

395
01:11:30,352 --> 01:11:32,320
Nice chic

396
01:11:37,192 --> 01:11:39,660
What's this chic?

397
01:11:43,699 --> 01:11:44,666
Ohic?

398
01:11:47,002 --> 01:11:51,837
Ohic... is someone...
a nice person is nice chic

399
01:12:03,052 --> 01:12:08,319
''Rohit, can l tell you something?
You're nice chic''

400
01:13:03,145 --> 01:13:08,640
A nice beginning to love

401
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:14,317
My world, my dreams...''

402
01:13:14,823 --> 01:13:17,724
are realising...

403
01:13:18,961 --> 01:13:25,389
''now that l have
taken a liking to you''''''

404
01:13:26,635 --> 01:13:31,595
l have begun to like you

405
01:13:57,032 --> 01:14:00,195
New destinations

406
01:14:00,636 --> 01:14:04,094
New roads

407
01:14:04,673 --> 01:14:06,436
l was on the earth

408
01:14:06,842 --> 01:14:08,571
To the skies...

409
01:14:08,944 --> 01:14:11,640
now l soar

410
01:14:13,315 --> 01:14:18,582
''Because l've
taken a liking for you''''''

411
01:14:20,589 --> 01:14:24,582
l've begun to like you

412
01:15:26,622 --> 01:15:33,585
''Now that the mystery
of life is unravelled...''''''

413
01:15:34,363 --> 01:15:39,665
my heart's on a song

414
01:15:42,004 --> 01:15:47,601
A new world now l live in...

415
01:15:49,444 --> 01:15:55,644
now that l've taken a liking to you

416
01:15:56,885 --> 01:16:00,582
l've begun to like you

417
01:17:08,624 --> 01:17:13,584
This ain't a deliberate union

418
01:17:16,298 --> 01:17:21,531
''This is something
beyond man's capacity''''''

419
01:17:23,939 --> 01:17:29,673
''lt's God's wish that
two hearts have found in each other''''''

420
01:17:31,613 --> 01:17:37,574
l've fallen for you

421
01:17:58,006 --> 01:18:04,570
What nice beginning to love

422
01:18:05,614 --> 01:18:12,383
''My world, my dreams,
are realising''''''

423
01:18:29,371 --> 01:18:29,769
l've fallen for you

424
01:18:56,698 --> 01:18:57,665
What's wrong with the lights?

425
01:18:57,833 --> 01:19:02,133
You blew the fuse
for fixing one light

426
01:19:04,039 --> 01:19:07,600
''Now watch it, you might
start a fire''

427
01:19:09,377 --> 01:19:11,436
l'm fed up.
- With you at home...

428
01:19:11,847 --> 01:19:17,376
''who needs another fire?
Look, the fuse is in place''

429
01:19:17,919 --> 01:19:20,479
Stop, don't touch those wires''

430
01:19:21,623 --> 01:19:23,250
Looks like lights are out

431
01:19:31,099 --> 01:19:35,593
''Rohit, how come you're home
all of a sudden?''

432
01:19:36,438 --> 01:19:38,372
l'm here to make
your dream come true

433
01:20:01,696 --> 01:20:02,890
Listen...

434
01:20:06,835 --> 01:20:11,704
''No matter how dark it is,
whether the lights come back or not...''

435
01:20:12,741 --> 01:20:14,641
my home is full of light

436
01:20:23,218 --> 01:20:24,981
So this is the dream?

437
01:20:27,689 --> 01:20:31,648
''No, what are you doing?
No touching feet in our family''

438
01:20:32,160 --> 01:20:33,650
We embrace

439
01:20:39,701 --> 01:20:41,225
May you be happy

440
01:20:50,679 --> 01:20:53,477
Wear this bracelet, my child''

441
01:21:17,372 --> 01:21:21,934
So now my responsibility is over

442
01:21:24,813 --> 01:21:26,974
Now it's all upto you...

443
01:21:28,750 --> 01:21:30,149
and Rohit

444
01:21:32,621 --> 01:21:34,282
But Aunty...

445
01:21:35,223 --> 01:21:38,784
No my child. Not Aunty

446
01:21:41,429 --> 01:21:43,056
Oall me Ma

447
01:22:15,230 --> 01:22:16,663
Oome here

448
01:22:17,432 --> 01:22:19,127
Me?
- Yes

449
01:22:22,370 --> 01:22:26,067
Where's your sardar (chief) ?
- He's right here (a sikh)

450
01:22:27,008 --> 01:22:30,307
l mean the hero.
The smart-looking guy

451
01:22:37,552 --> 01:22:39,383
He must be around somewhere

452
01:22:50,298 --> 01:22:51,765
Nisha, come here''

453
01:22:53,368 --> 01:22:55,336
Yes?
- Where's Sapna?

454
01:22:57,372 --> 01:22:59,340
She must be somewhere here.
- She's not here

455
01:23:00,342 --> 01:23:02,503
Must be in her room then.
- Oall her here

456
01:23:03,545 --> 01:23:05,479
''Let her be, please.
- Oall her, l say''

457
01:23:37,345 --> 01:23:39,279
Had you not come into my life...

458
01:23:41,349 --> 01:23:43,112
l'm in your life already

459
01:23:47,055 --> 01:23:49,751
l'm not letting you go anywhere

460
01:23:50,458 --> 01:23:52,585
Not even to play the guitar?
- No

461
01:23:53,061 --> 01:23:54,323
What happened?

462
01:23:55,430 --> 01:23:56,658
Where's Sapna?

463
01:23:58,299 --> 01:23:59,789
Where is she?

464
01:24:01,302 --> 01:24:03,327
She's in her room.
- So call her here

465
01:24:04,305 --> 01:24:07,069
She's asleep.
- Really?

466
01:24:11,346 --> 01:24:14,281
Oan't you talk to her
in the morning?

467
01:24:15,116 --> 01:24:18,313
Out of my way.
- She just went to bed. Let her sleep

468
01:24:20,355 --> 01:24:21,014
Listen, please...''

469
01:24:21,356 --> 01:24:25,122
the poor child must be tired.
Please let her sleep

470
01:24:51,252 --> 01:24:53,220
His father said that
in the newspapers

471
01:24:59,060 --> 01:25:00,721
Were you looking for me?

472
01:25:04,199 --> 01:25:05,928
No.
- Not a word...?

473
01:25:06,301 --> 01:25:11,933
''Not a word from the speaker, you see.
l went to fix that. A technical problem''

474
01:25:36,197 --> 01:25:40,463
What?
- l had to fix the cable again

475
01:25:41,035 --> 01:25:43,060
Everything's first-class now

476
01:25:45,206 --> 01:25:47,834
l understand.
Go back to the drum

477
01:26:06,294 --> 01:26:08,262
''So what are you telling me now,
sister-in-law?''

478
01:26:08,630 --> 01:26:10,928
You always told me that my prince
would come along some day...

479
01:26:11,299 --> 01:26:13,961
break open my cage
and fly away with me

480
01:26:16,004 --> 01:26:20,065
And now that l have found
the prince of my dreams...

481
01:26:20,508 --> 01:26:22,271
you say this to me?

482
01:26:24,579 --> 01:26:30,245
l wish you knew how much love Rohit's
mother gave me in just a few days

483
01:26:30,985 --> 01:26:36,946
''That the world outside these
four walls is so beautiful,...''

484
01:26:37,292 --> 01:26:42,252
l couldn't even dream about.
Look at these bangles

485
01:26:44,098 --> 01:26:47,261
Rohit's mother herself
put them on my wrists

486
01:26:48,169 --> 01:26:52,265
''Having met her, l got to know what
it means to have a loving mother''

487
01:26:53,041 --> 01:26:54,975
What it means to have
a happy family

488
01:26:55,443 --> 01:27:00,403
''For the first ever time, l saw
large-hearted people in a small house''

489
01:27:02,450 --> 01:27:05,317
''People in this house are not
as large-hearted, Sapna''

490
01:27:06,154 --> 01:27:11,023
''Forget him, Sapna.
We can do nothing we want to''

491
01:27:12,994 --> 01:27:17,795
''Please don't say that, sister-in-law.
Having met Rohit, l now feel...''

492
01:27:18,299 --> 01:27:21,268
as if l was only breathing
all these days

493
01:27:21,636 --> 01:27:26,266
But l've truly started living
my life now. With Rohit

494
01:27:33,147 --> 01:27:34,239
Welcome, uncle''

495
01:27:40,188 --> 01:27:41,246
He's here!

496
01:27:47,629 --> 01:27:48,926
How are you dear?
- l'm okay

497
01:27:49,297 --> 01:27:52,266
Gafoor...? You're balding too?

498
01:27:53,334 --> 01:27:56,929
Spoken like a true friend.
l knew you would come...

499
01:27:57,305 --> 01:28:00,900
''but so soon, l had no idea.
- l'm a true friend''

500
01:28:01,342 --> 01:28:05,005
For the first ever time your rotten
brains could think of something nice

501
01:28:05,513 --> 01:28:09,040
''Before you can change your mind,
l'm here with my troops''

502
01:28:09,417 --> 01:28:12,909
''Your husband has never
trusted me, sister-in-law''

503
01:28:13,288 --> 01:28:15,916
''Take him to London,
take him to Sydney...''

504
01:28:16,291 --> 01:28:20,921
he'll still remain a bloody ape.
- Never mind him

505
01:28:21,296 --> 01:28:23,594
Tell me where you've
hidden our daughter

506
01:28:23,965 --> 01:28:26,661
''Where will Sapna go? She's inside,
preparing for the function this evening''

507
01:28:28,303 --> 01:28:29,327
Bravo!

508
01:28:30,238 --> 01:28:32,206
You have indeed imparted
wonderful values to him

509
01:28:32,607 --> 01:28:34,541
''Despite living abroad,
he's an lndian at heart''

510
01:28:35,677 --> 01:28:39,204
Now tell me something.
How could such a sensible boy...

511
01:28:39,614 --> 01:28:43,573
''be born to a moron like you?
- Lucky for him, he was born to me''

512
01:28:43,951 --> 01:28:46,249
''Had he been born to you,
he'd have remained a moron''

513
01:28:48,289 --> 01:28:50,257
Will you keep your friend
standing here?

514
01:28:50,625 --> 01:28:52,593
Won't you play relative
and take me in?

515
01:28:52,960 --> 01:28:56,361
Obviously. l've invited you to
forge an alliance for my daughter

516
01:28:57,198 --> 01:29:00,065
Take a look at what l've arranged
for your hospitality. Oome on

517
01:29:33,901 --> 01:29:39,601
''Friends, that you have come here
on all nine days of this festival...''

518
01:29:40,408 --> 01:29:46,040
and participated in the celebrations
with such eagerness...

519
01:29:46,681 --> 01:29:50,913
thank you very much. With the
blessings of the Mother Goddess...

520
01:29:51,285 --> 01:29:53,253
l'm going to announce
a piece of good news...

521
01:29:54,288 --> 01:29:57,917
that will make this happy moment
even happier

522
01:29:59,360 --> 01:30:02,591
Sapna, come here''

523
01:30:07,802 --> 01:30:12,068
''Friends, this gentleman here has been
my friend since our childhood''

524
01:30:13,007 --> 01:30:18,377
Hasmukh Patel. And this young man
is his only son

525
01:30:20,214 --> 01:30:24,310
''With the Goddess's blessings,
before you tonight...''

526
01:30:26,821 --> 01:30:29,449
l announce the engagement of
my daughter Sapna and Rishabh

527
01:31:24,412 --> 01:31:26,004
Play the music!

528
01:33:27,668 --> 01:33:30,262
''Didn't you say the cage
has been opened, Rohit?''

529
01:33:30,805 --> 01:33:35,071
''That l've only got to learn to fly?
With you, l've learnt to fly''

530
01:33:35,509 --> 01:33:38,910
l'm not returning to that cage.
- But Sapna...

531
01:33:39,347 --> 01:33:42,282
We must go away as far away
from here as possible

532
01:33:42,750 --> 01:33:46,982
They can come looking for me.
- But Sapna...

533
01:33:59,834 --> 01:34:01,267
Run, Rohit!''

534
01:34:13,347 --> 01:34:15,281
Brother! Stop it!

535
01:34:16,083 --> 01:34:18,449
l'm in love with Rohit, brother''

536
01:34:22,423 --> 01:34:24,323
What are you doing, brother?''

537
01:35:14,942 --> 01:35:18,309
Sister-in-law return these bangles
to Rohit

538
01:35:44,038 --> 01:35:46,268
Don't be tense. Try again

539
01:35:47,341 --> 01:35:49,332
Try again. Go on

540
01:36:00,287 --> 01:36:02,721
Sapna, this is Rohit here''

541
01:36:06,293 --> 01:36:08,261
Are you listening, Sapna?''

542
01:36:15,369 --> 01:36:20,272
What happened?
- She hung up on me

543
01:36:22,243 --> 01:36:23,801
Something is surely wrong

544
01:36:24,512 --> 01:36:27,310
Do you have another coin?
Give it to me

545
01:36:29,350 --> 01:36:30,783
Dial again, Rohit''

546
01:36:41,462 --> 01:36:42,588
Sapna, l...''

547
01:36:43,030 --> 01:36:45,396
''Sapna's going to belong
to someone else, Rohit''

548
01:36:46,200 --> 01:36:51,729
She's getting engaged. What started
between us during the festival...

549
01:36:52,439 --> 01:36:57,775
ended with the festival.
Don't ever call this number again

550
01:37:01,282 --> 01:37:02,715
What happened, Rohit?''

551
01:37:13,093 --> 01:37:14,685
What happened?

552
01:37:15,396 --> 01:37:17,261
What did she say?
- Say something

553
01:37:18,332 --> 01:37:21,995
Who does she think she is?
- Where are you going?

554
01:37:22,436 --> 01:37:24,267
How can she end it all like this?

555
01:37:25,306 --> 01:37:27,274
Wait, Rohit''

556
01:37:28,342 --> 01:37:32,870
Sapna belongs to me. l won't
let her belong to anyone else

557
01:37:33,347 --> 01:37:34,279
Let me go!

558
01:37:56,971 --> 01:37:59,064
Sapna asked me to return these bangles

559
01:38:01,442 --> 01:38:04,878
Has she had enough of them already?

560
01:38:07,281 --> 01:38:09,215
Or has she found bangles
studded with diamonds?

561
01:38:10,684 --> 01:38:12,652
Rohit! Where are you going?

562
01:38:13,220 --> 01:38:16,246
To tell her that l'm not
a toy her father has bought...

563
01:38:16,991 --> 01:38:18,959
a toy she can break
anytime she wants to

564
01:38:20,928 --> 01:38:23,055
''lf she wants to turn me down,
she must do it in front of me''

565
01:38:24,298 --> 01:38:27,267
She'll have to look at me and
tell me that she does not love me

566
01:38:28,102 --> 01:38:32,300
''She loves you very much, Rohit.
She loves you very much''

567
01:38:33,974 --> 01:38:36,408
So much that she doesn't want you
to even suffer a scratch

568
01:38:37,211 --> 01:38:39,771
lf they get to know of
your affair...

569
01:38:40,281 --> 01:38:43,580
they'll give you a dog's death!
She's staying away from you...

570
01:38:43,951 --> 01:38:48,411
''only to save your life, Rohit.
Sapna's not happy with this marriage''

571
01:38:49,089 --> 01:38:54,391
''Only to give you life, she's willing
to turn into a living-corpse''

572
01:38:59,066 --> 01:39:03,400
''l beg of you, Rohit.
Forget Sapna''

573
01:39:06,941 --> 01:39:09,205
That would be good
for both of you

574
01:39:51,819 --> 01:39:54,049
ln love, we will not die''

575
01:39:55,289 --> 01:39:57,257
This much l will tell you...

576
01:39:58,292 --> 01:40:03,821
''you've got to live.
So have l''''''

577
01:40:28,322 --> 01:40:30,882
''Easy at times,
difficult at times...''''''

578
01:40:31,358 --> 01:40:34,327
strange is the road to love

579
01:40:34,828 --> 01:40:40,664
''But those in love,
are never left pining forever''''''

580
01:40:41,368 --> 01:40:45,327
The breeze...

581
01:40:48,409 --> 01:40:52,345
the weather, say...''

582
01:40:54,681 --> 01:40:59,380
''the season of love
has kicked up a storm''''''

583
01:41:01,055 --> 01:41:06,015
''Do not be afraid,
my sweetheart''''''

584
01:41:07,795 --> 01:41:12,323
This season will change

585
01:41:14,368 --> 01:41:19,328
And we shall etch out a love-story

586
01:43:07,347 --> 01:43:13,013
''So what if our stars
aren't favouring now...''''''

587
01:43:13,520 --> 01:43:19,322
''someday good times
will come seeking us''''''

588
01:43:20,427 --> 01:43:26,332
Love isn't put to test always

589
01:43:27,034 --> 01:43:32,939
Those in love never lose heart

590
01:43:37,444 --> 01:43:40,072
Love happens

591
01:43:40,614 --> 01:43:43,310
Love isn't deliberate

592
01:43:44,051 --> 01:43:48,112
''lt is something that's
not bestowed upon everyone''''''

593
01:45:19,813 --> 01:45:25,308
Broken hearts have made legends

594
01:45:26,453 --> 01:45:32,255
''ln love, lovers have
sacrificed themselves''''''

595
01:45:32,993 --> 01:45:39,023
''Think my love,
we got to unite''''''

596
01:45:39,499 --> 01:45:45,995
We got to tread together

597
01:45:50,043 --> 01:45:52,841
Love is a mystery...

598
01:45:53,347 --> 01:45:56,282
that cannot be explained

599
01:45:56,950 --> 01:45:59,817
Love is a song...

600
01:46:00,287 --> 01:46:02,721
that's not sung in every other tune

601
01:46:03,156 --> 01:46:07,252
The breeze...

602
01:46:09,830 --> 01:46:14,062
the weather, say...''

603
01:46:16,470 --> 01:46:21,271
''the season of love is here,
raising a storm''''''

604
01:46:23,043 --> 01:46:28,037
Do not be afraid, my love''

605
01:46:29,750 --> 01:46:34,915
For, this season will change''

606
01:46:36,289 --> 01:46:41,249
And a legend will be made

607
01:48:08,281 --> 01:48:12,308
''Pratap, enough solo pictures for you.
Have some taken with me''

608
01:48:12,786 --> 01:48:16,813
''Of course, it only adds to my respect.
Please come''

609
01:48:17,190 --> 01:48:20,250
''Raman... where are you?
Oome here, Gafoor''

610
01:48:23,296 --> 01:48:25,856
Where's Sapna?
- She must be in her room

611
01:48:26,299 --> 01:48:28,426
''l'll go and call her.
- lt's okay, l'll go and see''

612
01:48:31,238 --> 01:48:33,331
''Hurry up, Sapna. They're
waiting for you downstairs''

613
01:48:48,288 --> 01:48:49,915
Sapna, open the door''

614
01:48:51,358 --> 01:48:53,326
Open the door, l say''

615
01:48:56,196 --> 01:48:59,256
Sapna! Open the door!

616
01:49:13,313 --> 01:49:16,248
''l'm not going to spare you,
you squint-eyed Pathan''

617
01:49:25,292 --> 01:49:26,657
Pack it quickly

618
01:49:31,231 --> 01:49:32,960
Look, guys''

619
01:49:37,370 --> 01:49:40,203
What's wrong with him?

620
01:49:41,007 --> 01:49:43,703
But naturally.
That's how things are

621
01:49:46,413 --> 01:49:50,349
Something's surely fishy. Or why'd
he take his father aside?

622
01:49:51,217 --> 01:49:52,980
He'll have to take him aside

623
01:49:55,288 --> 01:49:58,052
''lt isn't only the brother,
the old man's getting furious too''

624
01:49:58,425 --> 01:50:00,859
l wonder what's going to happen.
- What will happen?

625
01:50:01,294 --> 01:50:04,388
They'll walk across to the
groom's father. That's how things are

626
01:50:10,370 --> 01:50:13,931
See Dholakia?
He's growing red in anger

627
01:50:15,041 --> 01:50:18,306
Obviously. lt has to do
with his daughter

628
01:50:20,347 --> 01:50:21,814
What do you mean?

629
01:50:25,251 --> 01:50:27,776
l broke the window pane and got
Sapna to run away with me

630
01:50:28,154 --> 01:50:30,418
Don't tell us!

631
01:50:39,099 --> 01:50:41,329
Where are you going?

632
01:50:43,036 --> 01:50:44,833
Do you think l'd dance
so well for free?

633
01:50:45,105 --> 01:50:46,868
l'm going to ask for my money

634
01:50:51,111 --> 01:50:55,912
You set the tiger's tail on fire
and put your hand in its mouth?

635
01:50:56,416 --> 01:50:58,384
Oh yes. Or he'd suspect us

636
01:50:58,685 --> 01:51:01,882
Take my advise.
Let's get the hell out of here

637
01:51:02,355 --> 01:51:04,585
Looks like l'll have to explain

638
01:51:07,360 --> 01:51:12,320
Now that Sapna has disappeared
from their sight...

639
01:51:13,166 --> 01:51:15,794
should their eyes fall on us...

640
01:51:16,369 --> 01:51:20,135
they're bound to be deceived

641
01:51:24,110 --> 01:51:28,570
''You guys wait here, while l go
pull the wool over their eyes''

642
01:51:32,619 --> 01:51:36,487
Kill each one of them! They've
extended a hand towards Sapna!

643
01:51:37,290 --> 01:51:39,884
Set the whole city on fire...
my sister!

644
01:51:40,360 --> 01:51:42,453
l told him earlier!
But dad wouldn't agree

645
01:51:42,829 --> 01:51:44,729
Shoot the bastard!

646
01:51:45,131 --> 01:51:46,325
What is it?

647
01:51:47,067 --> 01:51:49,831
''My money, sir?
- What money?''

648
01:51:50,370 --> 01:51:54,136
''l played the band just now, sir.
- What?''

649
01:51:54,607 --> 01:51:57,542
l presented the show, sir...''

650
01:51:58,044 --> 01:52:00,979
Give him the bloody money.
Throw it in his face!

651
01:52:01,448 --> 01:52:03,848
Oome with me...
l'll pay you the money

652
01:52:04,350 --> 01:52:06,978
''Uncle, l'm not going to spare him!
- We have guests at home''

653
01:52:07,353 --> 01:52:08,911
Raman-ji...
- What is it?

654
01:52:10,590 --> 01:52:14,993
''lt's okay... it's bloody well okay!
- Oome with me, band-master''

655
01:52:17,063 --> 01:52:18,121
Oome on

656
01:52:35,081 --> 01:52:36,013
Oome

657
01:52:52,565 --> 01:52:55,534
''Think it over, Rohit.
This could mean trouble''

658
01:52:56,169 --> 01:52:59,661
''Nayansukh is less your room-mate,
and more the warden's sidekick''

659
01:53:01,074 --> 01:53:05,568
''Sandy, the light of Nayansukh's eyes
lies in his glasses''

660
01:53:08,281 --> 01:53:10,306
No glasses, no danger''

661
01:53:12,352 --> 01:53:13,512
Go on

662
01:53:25,231 --> 01:53:26,994
God! The warden!

663
01:53:43,650 --> 01:53:45,140
Where are you coming from?

664
01:53:47,520 --> 01:53:49,488
''From the movies, sir.
- Right!''

665
01:53:54,360 --> 01:53:55,725
Which movie?

666
01:53:59,365 --> 01:54:01,799
Hum Saath Saath Hain

667
01:54:20,053 --> 01:54:22,578
The movie seems to have made
an impact on you guys

668
01:54:24,057 --> 01:54:25,786
You are sticking it out together

669
01:55:36,462 --> 01:55:40,592
Dream... a dream!
- What?

670
01:55:41,100 --> 01:55:43,591
''l had a terrible dream, Rohit.
A bloody nightmare''

671
01:55:46,306 --> 01:55:49,798
How can you dream...?
Your glasses were lying here

672
01:55:52,345 --> 01:55:53,642
That's true

673
01:56:19,372 --> 01:56:21,966
Go ahead and change.
- Here?

674
01:56:22,442 --> 01:56:24,603
Where else?
- ln your presence?

675
01:56:26,346 --> 01:56:29,713
''l'll go out, while you change.
- ln his presence then?''

676
01:56:30,283 --> 01:56:33,013
''No, we'll stay here.
You go outside and change''

677
01:56:33,419 --> 01:56:37,253
''ln front of everyone else?
- No, sorry''

678
01:56:40,526 --> 01:56:43,256
l'll turn around.
Go ahead and change

679
01:57:10,289 --> 01:57:15,056
Speak! Where's the squint-eyed Pathan?
Tell me

680
01:57:16,295 --> 01:57:17,819
Speak!

681
01:57:18,297 --> 01:57:20,925
''Ask Bashir at Kazipur. He should
know, he keeps moving around''

682
01:57:21,300 --> 01:57:25,031
Or ask Suleman. He knows what
happens in Mumbai

683
01:57:25,438 --> 01:57:27,929
Or ask that retired cabbie.
The guy who's bald...

684
01:57:28,341 --> 01:57:30,935
he knows what's happening
everywhere in Mumbai

685
01:57:35,014 --> 01:57:36,242
Speak! Tell me!

686
01:57:38,217 --> 01:57:42,244
''Babu from Pydhonie called, sir.
He couldn't get to know anything''

687
01:57:45,024 --> 01:57:47,788
Tell me where Pathan is...
speak!

688
01:57:49,996 --> 01:57:54,057
lngrate! You have lived off
the crumbs l threw to you

689
01:57:54,434 --> 01:57:58,734
And now that l need you...
you refuse to help? You bastard!

690
01:57:59,105 --> 01:58:05,203
Whom are you refusing? Dholakia...?
How dare you!

691
01:58:07,880 --> 01:58:09,745
Speak! Tell me!

692
01:58:14,287 --> 01:58:18,053
''Pratap, Raman called.
There's no news of Sapna yet''

693
01:58:21,994 --> 01:58:24,258
''Don't worry, Pratap.
Everything will be all right''

694
01:58:29,368 --> 01:58:33,361
We managed to spend the night.
How will we manage the day?

695
01:58:35,274 --> 01:58:39,973
We somehow hid her during the night.
What do we do with the daylight?

696
01:58:41,013 --> 01:58:45,245
''Look, there are so many guys around.
lf someone spots her...''

697
01:58:45,618 --> 01:58:47,415
word will reach the principal

698
01:58:49,989 --> 01:58:53,481
One moment. l suggest we take her
elsewhere from here

699
01:58:53,993 --> 01:58:55,961
My uncle has a farmhouse
ten kilometers away from here

700
01:58:56,295 --> 01:58:58,820
No one will get to know.
- What rubbish are you talking?

701
01:58:59,432 --> 01:59:01,798
Dholakia's daughter has been
missing all night

702
01:59:02,235 --> 01:59:04,533
''By now, he must've sent his guys
everywhere in town''

703
01:59:05,905 --> 01:59:08,203
''They must be searching every house,
with guns in their hands''

704
01:59:10,743 --> 01:59:13,507
lt's only this boys' hostel
nobody will think about

705
01:59:14,280 --> 01:59:16,908
He's right.
- We'll have keep Sapna here

706
01:59:17,283 --> 01:59:20,150
And how about the one who's with
Sapna right now? Nayansukh?

707
01:59:23,289 --> 01:59:27,055
That blind bat can rise any moment

708
01:59:29,195 --> 01:59:31,186
Praise the Lord!

709
01:59:36,002 --> 01:59:37,196
My glasses...?

710
01:59:43,276 --> 01:59:44,868
Rohit, wake up''

711
01:59:47,213 --> 01:59:48,805
l can't find my glasses

712
01:59:50,349 --> 01:59:52,249
Did you see my glasses?

713
01:59:56,289 --> 01:59:59,850
l couldn't sleep all night.
l heard strange noises

714
02:00:00,293 --> 02:00:02,761
Of someone singing, whispering...''

715
02:00:03,396 --> 02:00:07,924
l felt as if l was watching
a movie without my glasses

716
02:00:08,501 --> 02:00:10,833
Sit down here...
where are my glasses?

717
02:00:12,505 --> 02:00:15,269
Rohit, what's happening to us?''

718
02:00:16,342 --> 02:00:18,708
You can't speak. And l can't see

719
02:00:19,145 --> 02:00:21,375
How will l see
unless you speak?

720
02:00:21,814 --> 02:00:23,042
My glasses, Rohit''

721
02:00:23,416 --> 02:00:25,316
Let me have a glass of water

722
02:00:39,065 --> 02:00:40,327
A girl!

723
02:00:43,369 --> 02:00:45,132
lt's a girl!

724
02:00:56,916 --> 02:00:58,349
God Almighty!

725
02:02:01,981 --> 02:02:04,973
Know which girl
Rohit has brought here?

726
02:02:05,351 --> 02:02:07,319
Her father's a python.
A bloody python!

727
02:02:07,687 --> 02:02:11,714
''lf he gets to know his daughter is
here, he's going to swallow us!''

728
02:02:12,158 --> 02:02:14,126
''We're here to study,
not to die''

729
02:02:15,294 --> 02:02:17,728
''ln any case, he didn't tell us
before bringing her here''

730
02:02:18,097 --> 02:02:20,657
lt's just we saw her.
Or he would never have told us

731
02:02:21,067 --> 02:02:24,662
You're right. l told you
there's no need to call a meeting

732
02:02:25,104 --> 02:02:28,335
l suggest we tell the Principal
to call Dholakia

733
02:02:28,741 --> 02:02:32,268
Let Dholakia deal with it.
Or let Rohit

734
02:02:52,365 --> 02:02:55,334
''l admit, l took this step
without consulting you guys''

735
02:02:58,104 --> 02:03:00,095
l have even deceived
my friend Nayansukh

736
02:03:03,342 --> 02:03:05,276
But l had no other choice

737
02:03:07,346 --> 02:03:09,644
Maybe l shouldn't have
brought Sapna here

738
02:03:11,350 --> 02:03:12,977
But what could l do?

739
02:03:13,886 --> 02:03:17,117
''l knew, their men were watching
every road leading out of town''

740
02:03:18,057 --> 02:03:25,327
''And in this city, you guys are
my family and my home''

741
02:03:28,367 --> 02:03:31,495
Where else could l have taken her?
- Don't fall for his trap!

742
02:03:31,904 --> 02:03:34,372
He's conning us again!
- You have the fun...

743
02:03:34,774 --> 02:03:36,765
''and we bite the bullet?
- You'll escape,...''

744
02:03:37,143 --> 02:03:39,077
when the going gets hot.
And we'll get killed

745
02:03:39,345 --> 02:03:42,280
We don't want to land in trouble.
- Take that nuisance away!

746
02:03:44,250 --> 02:03:46,309
Take her away!

747
02:03:57,496 --> 02:04:02,058
You guys are right.
l'm a nuisance really

748
02:04:06,772 --> 02:04:12,267
''Ever since l was born, l have been
a nuisance to everyone around me''

749
02:04:15,147 --> 02:04:19,709
l was first a nuisance
to the family l was born in

750
02:04:22,354 --> 02:04:24,652
l never got to see
my mother's face

751
02:04:26,158 --> 02:04:31,460
But it was a nuisance for Papa
to look after me

752
02:04:34,166 --> 02:04:38,262
''l grew up, and turned a
nuisance for my brother''

753
02:04:40,039 --> 02:04:44,476
''l became a nuisance for my
sister-in-law, when l wanted to die''

754
02:04:46,345 --> 02:04:50,281
And now that l want lead
a free life...

755
02:04:56,422 --> 02:04:58,481
l've become a nuisance for Rohit.

756
02:05:03,996 --> 02:05:07,762
To save Rohit's life today...

757
02:05:09,301 --> 02:05:11,599
l've become a nuisance
for all of you

758
02:05:16,342 --> 02:05:22,281
When gun-toting men run after
an innocent young girl...

759
02:05:23,249 --> 02:05:25,649
her house is the first place
she runs to

760
02:05:28,354 --> 02:05:31,414
But my own folks are looking
for me with guns in their hands

761
02:05:33,025 --> 02:05:34,720
So where will l go?

762
02:05:36,629 --> 02:05:39,257
Such is the love my folks
have for me...

763
02:05:40,299 --> 02:05:43,462
that they'll kill my love
right in front of my eyes

764
02:05:45,771 --> 02:05:50,936
''From you, l seek life
not for myself. l seek life for Rohit''

765
02:05:54,346 --> 02:05:57,110
We're tying to make an attempt
to live our lives

766
02:05:58,551 --> 02:06:01,349
Will you support us
in our attempt?

767
02:06:24,243 --> 02:06:26,108
Rohit, l'm with you.''

768
02:06:30,983 --> 02:06:32,746
We're with you, Rohit''

769
02:06:35,020 --> 02:06:37,250
We're all with you!

770
02:07:19,298 --> 02:07:20,663
Forgive me

771
02:07:22,301 --> 02:07:25,464
''lf you whack my glasses again,
l'll have you suspended!''

772
02:10:51,410 --> 02:10:55,073
''The love that l have found here,
never had l imagined of''''''

773
02:10:55,581 --> 02:10:59,711
''Believe it or not,
the whole world belongs to me now''''''

774
02:11:00,018 --> 02:11:03,681
''How lonely we used to feel!
Tonight it feels like we're family''''''

775
02:11:04,156 --> 02:11:07,990
''Thanks to the Almighty, for the love
He has bestowed upon us''''''

776
02:11:53,872 --> 02:11:56,136
Sweetheart

777
02:12:00,279 --> 02:12:02,679
This world of ours...

778
02:12:03,248 --> 02:12:05,648
a world of love

779
02:12:06,151 --> 02:12:08,711
Where, love isn't feared''

780
02:12:09,254 --> 02:12:11,848
A world of true love

781
02:12:12,491 --> 02:12:14,322
O my sweetheart

782
02:12:24,569 --> 02:12:27,037
This world of ours...

783
02:12:27,506 --> 02:12:30,532
a world of love

784
02:12:31,276 --> 02:12:33,471
Where, love isn't feared''

785
02:12:34,012 --> 02:12:36,503
A world of true love

786
02:15:01,993 --> 02:15:05,929
''Pathan has never hidden behind a veil
to attack like a coward, Dholakia''

787
02:15:07,432 --> 02:15:12,267
You know it very well.
Whatever l have done till today...

788
02:15:13,004 --> 02:15:14,869
l took pride in doing it

789
02:15:15,440 --> 02:15:19,809
''l know, my worst enemy's life
lies trapped in his daughter''

790
02:15:20,512 --> 02:15:25,381
''But l'm so sorry,
your life is not with me''

791
02:15:26,051 --> 02:15:28,713
''Even in the past, you have
tried to attack her''

792
02:15:30,288 --> 02:15:32,586
How must l believe you are
not responsible for this?

793
02:15:33,024 --> 02:15:36,585
''Because you have no other choice,
apart from believing me''

794
02:15:37,195 --> 02:15:42,360
''Dholakia, l'm not here
to prove my innocence''

795
02:15:43,301 --> 02:15:48,261
l've come to tell you that if your
daughter was indeed in my custody...

796
02:15:48,807 --> 02:15:51,275
''l'd have called this meeting,
not you''

797
02:15:52,344 --> 02:15:54,972
At a place of my convenience

798
02:15:56,148 --> 02:16:01,814
And l'd have got you to agree
to all the things...

799
02:16:02,287 --> 02:16:06,951
that have been making us fight
each other for twenty years

800
02:16:08,426 --> 02:16:09,586
Get that?

801
02:16:10,061 --> 02:16:13,588
''ln our business, we keep
track of the enemy, Dholakia''

802
02:16:15,100 --> 02:16:19,434
''Not me, not any of your enemies in
the underworld is responsible for this''

803
02:16:19,971 --> 02:16:21,268
So where is she?

804
02:16:21,673 --> 02:16:24,107
Before you set fire to
other people's houses...

805
02:16:24,476 --> 02:16:26,944
''take a look in your
own house, Dholakia''

806
02:16:27,345 --> 02:16:30,371
lt isn't an old enemy
hitting back at you

807
02:16:31,283 --> 02:16:34,252
You have made a new foe

808
02:16:43,929 --> 02:16:48,798
''Pratap, here are the details of
the telephones in our house''

809
02:16:50,202 --> 02:16:55,265
The calls we received or made
in the last one month...

810
02:16:55,807 --> 02:16:59,641
it's all recorded in there.
Most numbers are familiar to us

811
02:17:00,145 --> 02:17:01,476
Except one

812
02:17:04,282 --> 02:17:06,910
From the day of the festival
to the engagement...

813
02:17:07,285 --> 02:17:09,845
this one number has been used
very frequently

814
02:17:10,288 --> 02:17:11,812
What's the number?

815
02:17:32,444 --> 02:17:39,247
''Praise the Lord, sir!
- Praise the Lord...?''

816
02:17:52,297 --> 02:17:55,266
''Where is Rohit?
- l don't know, sir''

817
02:17:58,303 --> 02:18:00,203
Where's Rohit?

818
02:18:03,008 --> 02:18:04,908
Where's Rohit?
- l don't know

819
02:18:06,278 --> 02:18:11,807
Where... where is Rohit?
- Here l am

820
02:18:26,298 --> 02:18:29,267
You think you're very smart?

821
02:18:30,235 --> 02:18:33,864
You think you will
run away with my sister?

822
02:18:34,973 --> 02:18:37,407
Where is my sister? Tell me.

823
02:18:47,218 --> 02:18:48,742
Where is my sister...?

824
02:18:53,291 --> 02:18:54,918
Where is my sister?

825
02:19:03,234 --> 02:19:07,193
Where is Sapna?
- Over here

826
02:19:07,706 --> 02:19:11,005
l'll dig her out of your heart...
- Brother...

827
02:19:22,787 --> 02:19:27,156
''No one made me run away, brother.
l came here of my own volition''

828
02:19:27,525 --> 02:19:29,686
Sit in the car.
- Brother

829
02:19:30,228 --> 02:19:32,287
Sit in the car!
- Listen...

830
02:19:32,797 --> 02:19:34,526
''Are you sitting in the car,
or aren't you?''

831
02:19:53,284 --> 02:19:57,243
Touch Sapna and l'll break
your hands

832
02:19:59,023 --> 02:20:00,923
Make a sieve out of him!

833
02:20:30,355 --> 02:20:35,315
''Your guns will run out of bullets,
but they won't back off''

834
02:20:37,295 --> 02:20:43,325
How many will you kill?
Two? Four? Six? Ten...?

835
02:20:45,136 --> 02:20:50,005
''And then...? And then,
you'll have to die too''

836
02:20:50,508 --> 02:20:52,373
Nobody's going to die!

837
02:21:00,351 --> 02:21:03,718
Put away those guns.
Put them away

838
02:21:07,058 --> 02:21:09,652
How dare you come here
without talking to me?

839
02:21:10,061 --> 02:21:11,028
But Papa...

840
02:21:13,598 --> 02:21:17,557
''Go and sit in the car, Raman.
Go''

841
02:21:26,578 --> 02:21:28,375
Oalm down, everybody''

842
02:21:28,913 --> 02:21:32,110
On behalf my son, l apologise to you''

843
02:21:33,017 --> 02:21:36,919
There's no need for any bloodshed.
l ask for your forgiveness

844
02:21:51,369 --> 02:21:53,837
Hadn't you even so much
of faith in your father?

845
02:21:56,107 --> 02:21:59,042
''You ought to have tried telling me
how you felt, my child''

846
02:22:01,579 --> 02:22:06,881
''l understand, my child. Behind your
fear lies the defeat of a father''

847
02:22:07,752 --> 02:22:12,121
lt isn't your mistake. Maybe there
was something lacking in my love

848
02:22:16,361 --> 02:22:18,989
l can't find a better
son-in-law than this boy

849
02:22:20,064 --> 02:22:24,330
l give you all my word.
Sapna will marry Rohit

850
02:22:34,579 --> 02:22:37,309
l'll consider it a favour
if you heed a request of mine

851
02:22:39,117 --> 02:22:43,315
''Like every father, l want to see
my daughter off from my house''

852
02:22:44,055 --> 02:22:48,389
l'll give her away in marriage
and send the two of you in style

853
02:22:49,360 --> 02:22:52,523
''Please fulfill this wish
of mine, my son''

854
02:22:56,501 --> 02:23:02,929
''What are you doing, sir?
We will do as you wish''

855
02:23:06,778 --> 02:23:10,270
''Let's go home, my child. We've got
to make arrangements for the wedding''

856
02:23:31,502 --> 02:23:33,265
Sister-in-law!

857
02:23:34,005 --> 02:23:39,807
Sister-in-law! l'm so happy!
All my dreams have been fulfilled!

858
02:23:40,345 --> 02:23:42,438
What happened?
- l couldn't ever imagine...

859
02:23:42,880 --> 02:23:44,814
l'd get whatever l wanted
so very soon

860
02:23:45,283 --> 02:23:47,308
Will you tell me what's happening?
- Rohit will come to our house...

861
02:23:47,685 --> 02:23:51,121
in a bridal procession. My hands
will be adorned with bridal henna!

862
02:23:53,091 --> 02:23:55,719
He'll anoint me with vermilion
in everybody's presence...

863
02:23:56,094 --> 02:23:59,325
and take me away
as his bride forever!

864
02:24:01,432 --> 02:24:05,061
Papa has given me all the happiness
in the world

865
02:24:07,238 --> 02:24:10,264
l realise today that my Papa
loves me as much as...

866
02:24:10,675 --> 02:24:13,109
every father in the world
loves his daughter!

867
02:24:13,544 --> 02:24:15,307
Stop it, Sapna! Stop it!''

868
02:24:17,048 --> 02:24:19,983
The truth is that you have
never understood your father

869
02:24:20,351 --> 02:24:23,115
He has deceived you.
Betrayed you!

870
02:24:23,521 --> 02:24:26,786
He has hatched a conspiracy
against the two of you

871
02:24:27,158 --> 02:24:29,592
He has lied to you so that he could
bring you back to this house...

872
02:24:29,961 --> 02:24:32,054
without creating a scene!
- This can't be true

873
02:24:32,430 --> 02:24:36,594
''lt's true, Sapna. There's no difference
between your brother and your papa''

874
02:24:37,235 --> 02:24:40,830
''They love their misplaced pride,
their false egos''

875
02:24:41,305 --> 02:24:44,502
''For their pride, they can
even strangle you!''

876
02:24:45,009 --> 02:24:47,978
''That's a lie, sister-in-law!
- lt's the truth, Sapna!''

877
02:25:06,164 --> 02:25:07,995
Papa, you can't do this to me!''

878
02:25:10,101 --> 02:25:13,264
You can't hand your daughter
such a betrayal!

879
02:25:20,511 --> 02:25:23,071
l'll die without Rohit, Papa''

880
02:25:24,515 --> 02:25:27,541
''Don't separate me from Rohit.
Please, Papa''

881
02:25:36,294 --> 02:25:37,591
Brother...

882
02:25:38,362 --> 02:25:46,030
''l have always obeyed you, brother.
l did nothing against your wishes''

883
02:25:48,473 --> 02:25:50,441
l have never asked you for anything

884
02:25:51,542 --> 02:25:57,310
''For the first time, l ask you for
my happiness. Please don't refuse me''

885
02:26:04,021 --> 02:26:08,924
''Uncle Gafoor, you have always
treated me like your daughter''

886
02:26:09,994 --> 02:26:11,962
You're my Papa's best friend

887
02:26:13,297 --> 02:26:15,959
He has never refused you anything

888
02:26:16,968 --> 02:26:18,765
Please make him see reason

889
02:26:20,371 --> 02:26:21,998
Make him see reason!

890
02:26:22,306 --> 02:26:24,274
Rohit means the life to me

891
02:26:24,675 --> 02:26:27,542
Tell him not to snatch my life
from me!

892
02:26:31,682 --> 02:26:33,650
''Not your life,
l'll take away Rohit's life''

893
02:26:34,018 --> 02:26:37,852
''lf you even utter his name again,
l'll hack him to pieces''

894
02:26:38,356 --> 02:26:42,588
Go and pack your bags. You're
leaving for London tonight

895
02:26:42,994 --> 02:26:45,462
To Aunt Lakshmi. Go on

896
02:27:20,298 --> 02:27:24,667
Your father said he wanted to see me
at your place. So why are we here?

897
02:27:25,303 --> 02:27:28,272
Oheats like you aren't invited home

898
02:27:29,941 --> 02:27:39,282
You use deceit to
get into people's homes

899
02:27:39,417 --> 02:27:43,717
Did you think you'd take my daughter
away from my house...

900
02:27:44,088 --> 02:27:46,579
and l'd stand watching
like a helpless father?

901
02:27:49,994 --> 02:27:53,259
l gave you a place to sit with me.
l gave you love and respect...

902
02:27:53,631 --> 02:27:56,065
and what did you give me
for my trust?

903
02:27:57,768 --> 02:27:59,258
A betrayal!

904
02:28:05,443 --> 02:28:07,377
And what are you doing now, sir?''

905
02:28:09,013 --> 02:28:14,246
l trusted your word and sent Sapna
with you. And you...?

906
02:28:14,785 --> 02:28:17,253
Who the hell are you to send or
not to send Sapna with me?

907
02:28:21,525 --> 02:28:27,054
''As for betrayals, l don't
keep scores remain unsettled''

908
02:28:28,299 --> 02:28:32,861
You betrayed me for Sapna's sake.
And l betrayed you to have her back

909
02:28:34,038 --> 02:28:37,201
''Even today, l have called you here
to settle scores with you''

910
02:28:43,447 --> 02:28:49,249
You had once saved my daughter's life.
And l save yours today

911
02:28:50,855 --> 02:28:54,586
Go on. l give you another opportunity
to lead your life

912
02:28:55,026 --> 02:28:57,551
Go away. Forever

913
02:29:01,232 --> 02:29:03,200
And listen to me very carefully

914
02:29:05,236 --> 02:29:08,205
l'm sending my daughter
far away from this country

915
02:29:10,074 --> 02:29:15,205
''lf you even utter Sapna's name again,
l'll kill you''

916
02:29:18,282 --> 02:29:20,216
That's a promise

917
02:29:33,130 --> 02:29:36,361
''That you yell betrays the weakness
of a father, Mr Dholakia''

918
02:29:37,969 --> 02:29:42,269
''l'm sorry to say this, but you haven't
called me here to grant me my life''

919
02:29:44,275 --> 02:29:47,142
You are still seeking
your daughter from me

920
02:29:49,213 --> 02:29:52,910
You lied the other day and
took Sapna away with you

921
02:29:54,986 --> 02:29:56,954
But your daughter got
left behind with me

922
02:30:01,525 --> 02:30:04,255
''When you couldn't make her forget me,
despite your threats...''

923
02:30:05,296 --> 02:30:09,323
''you come to me, so l may myself
leave her path''

924
02:30:12,303 --> 02:30:14,430
You came begging to the college

925
02:30:16,207 --> 02:30:18,141
And you're still begging
before me right now

926
02:30:20,277 --> 02:30:23,269
Beg for it or threaten me...

927
02:30:25,149 --> 02:30:27,447
l cannot give my love
away to you

928
02:30:29,253 --> 02:30:33,314
Because l have nothing else
except my love

929
02:30:35,693 --> 02:30:41,325
''As for sending Sapna far away, let me
tell you something, Mr Dholakia''

930
02:30:42,533 --> 02:30:44,592
Sapna is going to be my wife

931
02:30:45,603 --> 02:30:52,338
And what's sending her abroad? You
can't even take her out of the city

932
02:30:54,412 --> 02:30:58,348
And this isn't a promise.
lt's a challenge

933
02:31:18,269 --> 02:31:21,670
l wish you had listened to me

934
02:31:44,361 --> 02:31:47,330
One slap won't settle
scores with you

935
02:31:49,066 --> 02:31:51,534
Every breath of yours will
have to account for you

936
02:34:39,303 --> 02:34:43,034
l've killed the bastard.
l've only got to fix his body

937
02:34:43,474 --> 02:34:45,271
Be careful how you do it, Raman''

938
02:34:46,343 --> 02:34:49,471
No one must get to know
that we've killed Rohit

939
02:36:16,667 --> 02:36:19,261
My life

940
02:36:22,239 --> 02:36:24,707
My sweetheart

941
02:36:28,011 --> 02:36:31,242
My love

942
02:36:34,418 --> 02:36:38,980
This world of ours...

943
02:36:40,023 --> 02:36:44,426
a world of love

944
02:36:45,396 --> 02:36:50,265
Where, love isn't feared''

945
02:36:51,101 --> 02:36:56,061
A world of true love

946
02:37:34,278 --> 02:37:37,907
lt's said when a father does not
fulfill a child's wish...

947
02:37:38,282 --> 02:37:44,243
the child goes to his mother.
You never made me miss my mother

948
02:37:45,389 --> 02:37:49,257
But l feel like going away
to my mother today

949
02:38:16,987 --> 02:38:19,251
My life

950
02:38:21,792 --> 02:38:24,260
My sweetheart

951
02:38:26,463 --> 02:38:29,261
My love

952
02:38:31,969 --> 02:38:35,996
Oh, what world is this?''

953
02:38:37,274 --> 02:38:41,210
A world of deceit, betrayal''

954
02:38:42,212 --> 02:38:46,239
How can it comprehend Love?

955
02:38:47,284 --> 02:38:52,051
This world is against love

956
02:39:52,449 --> 02:39:55,213
''Nobody in this house
ever let me awaken in peace''''''

957
02:39:56,286 --> 02:39:59,050
''Maybe this is why l'm going
to look for eternal sleep''''''

958
02:39:59,423 --> 02:40:03,257
''l'm happy l don't have to seek
anybody's permission to do so''''''

959
02:43:12,015 --> 02:43:13,710
lt's too late, Rohit''

960
02:43:14,351 --> 02:43:16,114
l thought you were...

961
02:43:17,354 --> 02:43:18,981
l'm going away

962
02:43:20,023 --> 02:43:22,321
''You're not leaving me and
going away anyplace, Sapna''

963
02:43:23,360 --> 02:43:29,390
''Not now, not in the future.
Not ever''

964
02:43:33,537 --> 02:43:37,268
You're crazy! You're mad!

965
02:43:39,342 --> 02:43:41,936
''lf you want to die for him,
go ahead and die!''

966
02:43:42,345 --> 02:43:45,280
But he's going with you too

967
02:44:01,298 --> 02:44:03,266
Kill the bastard!

968
02:44:34,297 --> 02:44:35,264
Get him

969
02:45:16,873 --> 02:45:20,309
You played with death and exulted
in your victories all your life

970
02:45:21,044 --> 02:45:24,673
''Today, your daughter has defeated you
at your game and gone away forever''

971
02:45:28,051 --> 02:45:31,043
She quietly languished
in this cage all her life...

972
02:45:31,421 --> 02:45:35,255
without ever complaining.
And you...

973
02:45:35,992 --> 02:45:39,587
you took her silence
for a medal of love!

974
02:45:43,300 --> 02:45:46,269
She wished to breathe freely
for a while...

975
02:45:47,304 --> 02:45:49,795
and you snatched away her life

976
02:45:53,343 --> 02:45:59,873
She wished to walk ahead in life...
and you took away her life!

977
02:46:04,354 --> 02:46:09,257
''No, Mr Dholakia. Your daughter
has not committed suicide''

978
02:46:10,860 --> 02:46:12,851
You have murdered her!

979
02:49:00,230 --> 02:49:04,189
''Mr Dholakia, you may go in
and meet your daughter''
