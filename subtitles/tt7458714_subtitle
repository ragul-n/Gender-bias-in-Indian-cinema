Sir, 20 are killed and 40 are injured.

Brother! Brother!
[panting]

00:05:15,343 --> 00:05:17,552
Nothing will happen Brother.
[panting]

9
00:05:19,135 --> 00:05:19,885
Brother

10
00:05:21,218 --> 00:05:22,635
Come on, come fast

11
00:05:25,093 --> 00:05:25,927
Come on start fast.

12
00:05:26,218 --> 00:05:27,093
Come on.. fast.

13
00:05:27,468 --> 00:05:28,427
Start the vehicle fast, move fast

14
00:05:28,802 --> 00:05:29,927
move fast

15
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:37,480
[panting increases]

[panting]

17
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:43,260
Roshan, what Son?

18
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:44,968
What happened?

19
00:05:45,843 --> 00:05:46,677
Have you dreamt?

20
00:05:46,968 --> 00:05:47,802
Not a dream mom,

21
00:05:48,552 --> 00:05:49,093
True

22
00:05:49,135 --> 00:05:50,593
What is that truth son?

23
00:05:50,885 --> 00:05:52,385
Some one killed me

24
00:05:52,927 --> 00:05:53,968
Who killed?

25
00:05:54,093 --> 00:05:54,927
Don't know that.

26
00:05:57,552 --> 00:05:58,927
Why did they kill son?

27
00:05:59,427 --> 00:06:00,843
For loving the girl

28
00:06:01,093 --> 00:06:02,135
Which girl, son?

29
00:06:03,177 --> 00:06:04,093
Who is that girl?

30
00:06:05,093 --> 00:06:06,677
Do you know the name of that girl?

31
00:06:07,552 --> 00:06:08,593
Afreen!

32
00:06:11,177 --> 00:06:12,927
Oh God, where did she go?

33
00:06:13,093 --> 00:06:14,052
Afreen,

34
00:06:14,218 --> 00:06:15,385
where did you hide?

35
00:06:15,427 --> 00:06:17,927
Show yourself, else I will be angry.
[sobbing]

36
00:06:18,052 --> 00:06:18,885

38
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:24,677
Oh God, what happened my dear?

39
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:27,510
Look here, why are you crying?

40
00:06:27,802 --> 00:06:30,760
Mom, I remember something

41
00:06:30,885 --> 00:06:32,010
What are you remembering?

42
00:06:32,177 --> 00:06:33,510
I was dead

43
00:06:34,635 --> 00:06:35,135
You...

44
00:06:36,385 --> 00:06:37,635
you were dead?

45
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:40,677
When?

46
00:06:41,052 --> 00:06:42,260
Do not know

47
00:06:45,635 --> 00:06:47,260
What is happening to my daughter?

48
00:06:48,802 --> 00:06:49,843
Nothing will happen dear

"Embrace me"
-"Embrace me..."

52
00:07:17,134 --> 00:07:23,098

beautiful night would come again"

"...we'd meet again or not"
-"...we'd meet again or not"

55
00:07:36,492 --> 00:07:37,248
Roshan,

56
00:07:38,593 --> 00:07:40,010
How are you singing this song?

57
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:43,302
You do not know Hindi right?

58
00:07:44,843 --> 00:07:46,093
How are you singing then?

59
00:07:49,023 --> 00:07:50,201
[flight whizzing] [blast]

60
00:07:50,735 --> 00:07:52,667
[gun fire] [blasts]

61
00:07:58,093 --> 00:08:00,427
The same dreams are
haunting him from childhood.

62
00:08:00,968 --> 00:08:03,010
I often fear seeing him

63
00:08:03,843 --> 00:08:05,593
He is so attracted to Military

64
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:11,010
He even goes to his college
riding the Military bullet

65
00:08:12,677 --> 00:08:15,468
You know right,
the green colour Military Bullet

66
00:08:15,968 --> 00:08:16,510
That one

67
00:08:19,718 --> 00:08:20,260
Sir...

68
00:08:20,885 --> 00:08:24,093
Will any youngster wake up at
4 in the morning now a day?

69
00:08:24,718 --> 00:08:28,177
He early morning leaves to Secunderabad
Military ground like he has some work

70
00:08:33,718 --> 00:08:38,760
After the college, he does part time job
and is studying with that money on his own

71
00:08:39,135 --> 00:08:40,593
He never asks even a rupee from father,

72
00:08:40,968 --> 00:08:41,802
No pocket money

73
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:47,927
I am frightened seeing his discipline,
thinking whether he is our son or not

74
00:08:48,968 --> 00:08:52,968
Because none like him was never born
either in my family or family of my wife

75
00:08:53,218 --> 00:08:55,302
Why is he behaving like this, is he mad?

76
00:08:55,593 --> 00:08:56,052
No

77
00:08:57,093 --> 00:08:58,510
Because of his past life

78
00:08:58,885 --> 00:08:59,385
What?

79
00:08:59,718 --> 00:09:00,135
Yes

80
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:02,302
Symptoms of his past life

81
00:09:03,968 --> 00:09:07,760
That influence is clearly known in some

82
00:09:08,468 --> 00:09:10,385
Still what is wrong with these?

83
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:13,052
What all you said are
good qualities right?

84
00:09:13,927 --> 00:09:15,010
Good qualities,

85
00:09:15,552 --> 00:09:17,510
no habits like smoke or drink and happy

86
00:09:18,218 --> 00:09:21,385
But the social responsibility,
he says patriotism

87
00:09:21,635 --> 00:09:24,177
He attacks as and where
sees something going wrong.

88
00:09:24,427 --> 00:09:26,385
We are so much tensed.

89
00:09:26,927 --> 00:09:30,635
The worst quality in him is
that he has no fear at all

90
00:09:30,968 --> 00:09:31,552
Fear..

91
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:34,093
That is my fear

92
00:09:36,468 --> 00:09:38,177
She did not give up smoking
even after coming for trekking

93
00:09:38,218 --> 00:09:39,677
She is so,
never listens even after saying so much

94
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,302
Yes dude

95
00:09:40,385 --> 00:09:42,052
Donate something on the name of God

96
00:09:44,593 --> 00:09:46,552
God would ease all your troubles,

97
00:09:46,885 --> 00:09:47,718
Praise the Lord

98
00:09:47,885 --> 00:09:48,552
Praise the Lord

99
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,677
It is too cold here

100
00:09:49,927 --> 00:09:50,927
Give the lighter

101
00:09:50,968 --> 00:09:51,510
Take this

102
00:09:51,635 --> 00:09:52,302
Thankyou.

103
00:10:15,177 --> 00:10:15,802
Sir...

104
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:21,510
the criminal in your wanted
list is sitting in front of me

105
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,218
What..?

106
00:10:26,635 --> 00:10:28,135
If you can come, you can arrest him

107
00:10:37,427 --> 00:10:37,885
Hi

108
00:10:39,593 --> 00:10:40,510
Where did you come from?

109
00:10:40,843 --> 00:10:41,552
Hyderabad

110
00:10:41,927 --> 00:10:43,052
Did you recognize me?

111
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:44,468
No

112
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:46,260
No

113
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:05,927
Say, where is he?

114
00:11:13,718 --> 00:11:14,968
You hit me, rascal?

115
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:18,843
Come, come on you...

116
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:24,718
You give a complaint on me, idiot?

117
00:11:25,468 --> 00:11:27,010
You just said not to
recognize me when I asked

118
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:29,135
You dirty rascal,

119
00:11:29,718 --> 00:11:31,135
What will they do to me?

120
00:11:31,343 --> 00:11:32,510
Come, come on

121
00:11:38,552 --> 00:11:41,218
Come on, come and shoot me.

122
00:11:41,385 --> 00:11:41,802
Shoot

123
00:11:47,343 --> 00:11:48,052
Roshan, stop

124
00:11:48,718 --> 00:11:49,843
Hey, leave

125
00:11:50,135 --> 00:11:51,718
Leave idiot, leave

126
00:11:55,302 --> 00:11:56,843
Hey go rascal, go

127
00:12:01,843 --> 00:12:03,177
Roshan, are you ok?

128
00:12:05,968 --> 00:12:07,177
I will see your end...

129
00:12:08,302 --> 00:12:10,093
Ajay, nothing happened to you right?

130
00:12:12,552 --> 00:12:13,427
Go idiot, go

131
00:12:21,468 --> 00:12:22,302
Bend down,

132
00:12:24,343 --> 00:12:26,385
Hey mad fellow, do not shoot.

133
00:12:26,427 --> 00:12:27,677
Hey mad fellow

134
00:12:59,302 --> 00:13:00,968
Did you fire the gun anytime before this?

135
00:13:01,177 --> 00:13:02,385
No sir, first time

136
00:13:02,718 --> 00:13:05,177
I cannot shoot and how did
you shoot so perfectly?

137
00:13:05,385 --> 00:13:05,927
No idea Sir

138
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:07,343
What to do with this fellow now sir?

139
00:13:08,927 --> 00:13:09,760
What to do?

140
00:13:09,843 --> 00:13:12,302
Write your name in gun fire
and you will get a promotion

141
00:13:13,552 --> 00:13:14,677
Ok, who are these?

142
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:16,427
My friends Sir

143

Yes Sir

144
00:13:17,218 --> 00:13:18,302
Why did you come here?

145
00:13:18,385 --> 00:13:18,927
Trekking

146
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:21,135
Trekking, trekking... What trekking guys?

147
00:13:21,802 --> 00:13:22,927
What do you do in trekking?

148
00:13:24,177 --> 00:13:25,010

It is like you live only when you get
a situation die at least once in life

156
00:13:43,552 --> 00:13:44,510
Did you see death?

157
00:13:44,802 --> 00:13:45,635
I saw

158
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,302
How is it?

159
00:13:46,385 --> 00:13:47,343
It is in no way good

00:14:30,843 --> 00:14:33,510
Hey Roshan, you too love some girl by then

176
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,010
We then will go as three couples

00:15:23,385 --> 00:15:25,093
Come on, you are not eating anything

191
00:15:30,385 --> 00:15:30,802

193
00:15:33,468 --> 00:15:35,302
I am asking as the time has come

194
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:39,677
Because even our Nadir
likes your daughter a lot

195
00:15:40,593 --> 00:15:41,427
Ok

196
00:15:42,468 --> 00:15:44,718
What Sir, what are you thinking?

197
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:48,177
No,

198
00:15:49,093 --> 00:15:51,760
Even my wife likes this match. Okay.

199
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:55,635
Just... Then why is this delay?

200
00:15:56,802 --> 00:16:00,010
I was thinking,
should go and ask about wish of Afreen

201
00:16:00,177 --> 00:16:02,218
What Sir, what will you ask?

202
00:16:02,468 --> 00:16:04,302

00:17:15,052 --> 00:17:16,427
Are you sending her to India?

222
00:17:17,468 --> 00:17:20,052
Hey, that is a worst country

223
00:17:20,468 --> 00:17:23,552
All terrorists stay over there

00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:26,135
Son Nadir, be patient

225
00:17:27,302 --> 00:17:31,135

00:18:06,593 --> 00:18:07,010

00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:12,968

234
00:18:13,177 --> 00:18:17,093
Why fear mom,

238
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:25,593
India and your house?

239
00:18:25,843 --> 00:18:28,302
Why, Can India not be my home?

240
00:18:30,343 --> 00:18:34,010
Like how the Sun cannot rise from the east

241
00:18:35,093 --> 00:18:40,135
and like how one animal
cannot pray for a Muslim...

242
00:18:41,001 --> 00:18:42,108
Similarly...

243
00:18:42,641 --> 00:18:47,710
India can never be the
home for a Pakistani

244
00:18:48,927 --> 00:18:50,843
I am thus frightened dear

245
00:18:52,635 --> 00:18:57,635
"When the breeze has pinched closely,
it touched the heart"

246
00:18:57,927 --> 00:19:03,010
"When the breeze has pinched closely,
it touched the heart"

247

"When the breeze has pinched closely,
it touched the heart"

248
00:19:24,635 --> 00:19:30,218

I became like a dancing peacock"

249
00:19:35,885 --> 00:19:40,927
"It is not possible to close
the doors of the heart"

250
00:19:45,843 --> 00:19:50,968
"When the breeze has pinched closely,
it touched the heart"

251
00:20:18,802 --> 00:20:23,511
"What is this unbearable pleasure?"

252
00:20:24,198 --> 00:20:28,742
"Whats its story?"

253
00:20:29,683 --> 00:20:34,103
"What is my bonding with this land?"

254
00:20:34,975 --> 00:20:38,881
"Why do my feet not stop?"

255
00:20:40,101 --> 00:20:46,079
"It is not possible to close
the doors of the heart"

256
00:20:49,968 --> 00:20:55,635
"When the breeze has pinched closely,
it touched the heart"

257
00:21:22,794 --> 00:21:27,273
"May be this is the indication...

258
00:21:28,115 --> 00:21:32,814
...of a new dream for the eyes"

259
00:21:33,427 --> 00:21:37,948
"May be this is the way to reach...

260
00:21:38,916 --> 00:21:42,633
...a new world never into the thoughts"

261
00:21:44,091 --> 00:21:50,011
"It is not possible to close
the doors of the heart"

262
00:21:53,968 --> 00:21:59,635
"When the breeze has pinched closely,
it touched the heart"

263
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:10,177
"When the rain drops sounded like band,
I became like a dancing peacock"

264
00:22:15,802 --> 00:22:21,010
"It is not possible to close
the doors of the heart"

265
00:22:23,923 --> 00:22:24,977

mental peace and meditation

327

348
00:25:31,302 --> 00:25:32,302

Oh no, who do you think he is?
-Who?

355
00:25:46,677 --> 00:25:47,635
New Principal

356
00:25:48,218 --> 00:25:51,302
Principal.. You ruined it all dude

357
00:25:55,385 --> 00:25:58,052
I am dismissing all of
you from the College

358
00:25:59,052 --> 00:26:02,010
What is there to dismiss Sir?
We finished our degree

359
00:26:02,302 --> 00:26:03,635

360
00:26:03,843 --> 00:26:06,677

00:26:08,802 --> 00:26:09,635
Roshan Sir

363
00:26:12,052 --> 00:26:13,385
Why is he so egoistic?

364
00:26:13,718 --> 00:26:14,635
He is so Sir

365
00:26:19,302 --> 00:26:21,510
Ask him to say sorry to me

366
00:26:21,552 --> 00:26:22,385
He will not say Sir

367
00:26:23,343 --> 00:26:25,260
Why, ego?

368
00:26:27,433 --> 00:26:33,260
If he has so much ego, being the
Principal how much ego should I have?

369
00:26:34,135 --> 00:26:39,927
So, I will do one thing to satisfy my ego.

370
00:26:40,802 --> 00:26:43,552
Ask him to bear that

371
00:26:44,343 --> 00:26:45,802
Did you understand?

372
00:27:40,927 --> 00:27:43,552
What man,
you said to get quotation and you did not.

373
00:27:43,677 --> 00:27:46,968
That has to be on my table by 5 in
the evening and I will sign only then.

374
00:27:47,593 --> 00:27:49,385
Ok madam, when would you come to office?

375
00:27:49,677 --> 00:27:51,927
My Son passed Engineering in 1st class

376
00:27:52,635 --> 00:27:54,760
I will have lunch and come, ok? Ok madam

377
00:27:55,885 --> 00:27:57,135
I will serve. Okay.

378
00:27:59,218 --> 00:28:02,635
Son, what is your future plan?

379
00:28:03,552 --> 00:28:06,093
What do you wish to do?
-Mom, I want to join Military

380
00:28:07,968 --> 00:28:10,885
Mom knows well that you have
that wish from childhood

381
00:28:12,135 --> 00:28:15,635
But remember my son,
Military is not a job.

382
00:28:16,302 --> 00:28:19,343
It is a service and
sacrifice for the country

383
00:28:19,843 --> 00:28:21,135
Yes, I am ready

384
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:24,593
Then, cheers to the Indian Army

385
00:28:24,718 --> 00:28:25,385
Military?

386
00:28:27,093 --> 00:28:28,218
You want to join in Military?

387
00:28:28,343 --> 00:28:28,968
Yes dad

388
00:28:29,802 --> 00:28:33,052
If you had said that before, I would have
pushed you into Military after 10th class

389
00:28:33,343 --> 00:28:35,302
Why to waste my money till Engineering?

390
00:28:35,927 --> 00:28:38,385
It is you wasting and boasting but not him

391
00:28:39,427 --> 00:28:41,385
He wants to do something
and let him do it.

392
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:44,343
You do not push all your
fantasies over him please

393
00:28:44,885 --> 00:28:47,927
My son knows well about
what is good and what is bad

394
00:28:48,343 --> 00:28:51,885
Look here, we lose value at
home marrying a clever wife.

395
00:28:52,302 --> 00:28:54,093
We should never marry
a girl knowing English.

396

397

you will die in some war

398

my grandpa and all uncles died here.

400
00:29:06,343 --> 00:29:08,260
We die either war comes or not

401
00:29:08,968 --> 00:29:12,218
You die with BP and I die with a
bullet hitting me and that is all

402
00:29:12,885 --> 00:29:14,885
I hate logics and statistics

403
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:18,427

404
00:29:18,802 --> 00:29:21,093

408

will not give you my properties.

Hubby, you have my foot.

410
00:29:34,468 --> 00:29:35,802
Yes, I will not give that to him.

411
00:29:35,885 --> 00:29:36,802
It is hard earned by me

412
00:29:38,052 --> 00:29:38,802

419

waiting there for me.

00:45:57,935 --> 00:45:58,893
Turn around.

610
00:46:05,393 --> 00:46:06,518
Turn this side.

611
00:46:14,268 --> 00:46:15,310
Sit down.

612
00:46:19,268 --> 00:46:25,018
I am going sleepless these days.
Why not speak something?

613
00:46:26,727 --> 00:46:27,935
When are you coming?

614
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:32,810

615
00:46:34,685 --> 00:46:37,227

616
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:39,310

618
00:46:42,810 --> 00:46:44,060
Remove the scarf

619
00:46:44,602 --> 00:46:47,518
I am saying you to take off the scarf

620
00:46:48,935 --> 00:46:49,935
Hey, who is that?

621
00:46:51,310 --> 00:46:52,435
Turn the camera that side.

622
00:46:52,518 --> 00:46:54,477
No, she is my roommate.

623
00:46:54,643 --> 00:46:56,560
Hey, turn the camera that side.
Who is that?

624
00:47:06,143 --> 00:47:07,727
What nonsense are you talking?

625
00:47:08,227 --> 00:47:09,102
Say what happened?

626
00:47:09,893 --> 00:47:11,852
I do not like to go for this marriage mom

627
00:47:12,018 --> 00:47:15,018
Afreen, I asked what has happened?

628
00:47:15,393 --> 00:47:16,602
Don't ask me anything

629
00:47:16,685 --> 00:47:17,768
Afreen, tell me...

630
00:47:18,727 --> 00:47:19,477
Afreen...

631
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:29,518
[Arabic language] [The song is about self
motivation & to fight for what you want]

632
00:47:29,718 --> 00:47:32,583
[song continues] [blasts]

633
00:47:34,544 --> 00:47:35,549
[song continues] [flight engines roaring]

634
00:47:37,723 --> 00:47:38,775
[song continues] [blast]

635
00:47:45,861 --> 00:47:47,431
[song continues] [girl screams]

636
00:47:48,637 --> 00:47:51,942
[gasping]

637
00:47:52,643 --> 00:47:53,352
Son...

638
00:47:54,977 --> 00:47:57,477
What happened? Is it the same dream again?

639
00:47:57,727 --> 00:47:58,685
Yes mom.

640
00:48:00,435 --> 00:48:03,643
Why are you getting the same dreams
repeatedly from so many years?

641
00:48:04,018 --> 00:48:05,268
I too am not understanding mom,

642
00:48:05,810 --> 00:48:07,810
I somehow am remembering The Himalayas...

643
00:48:10,060 --> 00:48:11,518
I feel like going there.

644
00:48:14,268 --> 00:48:15,852
I gave word to someone that I will come,
mom.

645
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:19,227
I am giving you a word. I will come again.

646
00:48:19,685 --> 00:48:21,435
I will come again...

647
00:48:23,137 --> 00:48:29,093
[clock ticking]

648
00:48:32,727 --> 00:48:35,518
We cannot believe any girl in these days.

649
00:48:36,935 --> 00:48:39,685
None how they change in time.

650
00:48:40,143 --> 00:48:42,352
You know how much do I like your daughter.

651
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:45,893
She is saying no for marriage with me...

652
00:48:46,161 --> 00:48:46,707
[sighs]

653
00:48:47,227 --> 00:48:50,060
She is definitely in love
with someone in India.

654
00:48:50,227 --> 00:48:51,060
Oh God!

655
00:48:52,185 --> 00:48:53,768
What nonsense are you talking?

656
00:48:55,018 --> 00:48:56,310
We know what she is.

657
00:48:56,852 --> 00:48:58,477
She never does such mistake.

658
00:48:58,685 --> 00:49:01,602
She is your daughter just
at home and not in India

659
00:49:02,768 --> 00:49:07,977
If she does any mistake now,
prestige of our family gets ruined.

660
00:49:08,893 --> 00:49:10,143
Call her back...

661
00:49:10,739 --> 00:49:12,465
[phone vibrates]

662
00:49:15,727 --> 00:49:17,143
Assalam o alaikum (peace be on you) mom...

663
00:49:17,352 --> 00:49:19,727
Walaikum assalam (peace be on
you too) baby, where are you?

664
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:21,268
In the hostel.

665
00:49:23,977 --> 00:49:26,143
Your dad's health is not well.

666
00:49:28,268 --> 00:49:31,810
Hello Afreen,
are you listening to what I am saying?

667
00:49:32,768 --> 00:49:38,143
Your dad's Health is not well,
you immediately start back to Pakistan

668
00:49:39,185 --> 00:49:40,518
Why, what happened to dad?

669
00:49:40,643 --> 00:49:43,810
He is worried from two
days thinking of you dear

670
00:49:45,227 --> 00:49:49,977
You come back to Pakistan at
the earliest possible, please.

671
00:49:51,477 --> 00:49:52,518
See you.

672
00:49:55,143 --> 00:49:56,602
Oh! God... please forgive me.

673
00:50:01,310 --> 00:50:02,643
Hey, what is this?

674
00:50:04,529 --> 00:50:06,768
Our son got an interview
call from Military..

675
00:50:06,810 --> 00:50:09,477
That means you apply and you join.

676
00:50:09,727 --> 00:50:11,268
Will you not tell me even a word?

677
00:50:11,685 --> 00:50:12,874
Theres a god like man at home...

678
00:50:13,090 --> 00:50:15,015
Don't you have any common
sense to take his opinion?

679
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:16,668
Not him but I should hit you.

680
00:50:16,958 --> 00:50:18,152
[chuckles]
-Hey!

681
00:50:18,528 --> 00:50:19,373
Why are you laughing?

682
00:50:19,573 --> 00:50:22,560
Not that, I have been watching
from the time of our marriage.

683
00:50:22,852 --> 00:50:26,393
You have been saying to hit
but why did you never hit?

684
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:28,477
I wish to see how it feels if you hit.

685
00:50:28,518 --> 00:50:31,435
Why would I do such an idiotic thing?
Where is he?

686
00:50:31,852 --> 00:50:32,727
Where is he?

687
00:50:33,018 --> 00:50:34,435
-Dad
-Huh?

688
00:50:35,060 --> 00:50:37,227
I already passed Military written test.

689
00:50:37,435 --> 00:50:38,060
What?

690
00:50:38,435 --> 00:50:39,768
I have a physical test in Delhi.

691
00:50:40,435 --> 00:50:42,935
If I pass even that,
I will become a captain in Army

692
00:50:43,893 --> 00:50:46,227
I am now going for trekking in the
Himalayas along with my friends

693
00:50:47,018 --> 00:50:50,352
And after that finishing
the physical test in Delhi,

694
00:50:50,435 --> 00:50:52,518
I will come home with posting orders
and I then need your blessings.

695
00:50:52,727 --> 00:50:54,643
What blessing you need?
Everything is planned.

696
00:50:54,893 --> 00:50:57,768
You both are saying the information
and I am listening like a mad fellow.

697
00:50:57,852 --> 00:50:59,393
Mad...

698
00:51:01,685 --> 00:51:03,518
-Sir...
-What?

699
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:07,477
I am leaving back home today,
did you get his number?

700
00:51:07,768 --> 00:51:08,393
Who are you?

701
00:51:08,685 --> 00:51:12,060
Sir, its me Afreen,
I met you twice or thrice

702
00:51:12,102 --> 00:51:14,227
-Pakistani?
-Yes sir

703
00:51:14,393 --> 00:51:16,102
You are speaking Telugu.

704
00:51:16,727 --> 00:51:18,268
Sir, number

705
00:51:18,977 --> 00:51:20,435
Interesting character.

706
00:51:22,005 --> 00:51:24,602
He does not like Pakistan and
why do you need to call him?

707
00:51:24,643 --> 00:51:26,685
Sir, I just want to thank him before I go.

708
00:51:26,893 --> 00:51:28,060
I met him yesterday or day before.

709
00:51:29,768 --> 00:51:33,643
I asked for number. Has he given or not...

710
00:51:38,352 --> 00:51:40,602
R-O-S-A-N...

711
00:51:40,727 --> 00:51:42,977
Sir, no it is.. R-O-S-H-A-N

712
00:51:43,060 --> 00:51:44,060
I write it that way.

713
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:49,602
It comes only when I write ROSAN,
it does not come if written as you said

714
00:51:50,102 --> 00:51:50,810
Note it down.

715
00:51:50,893 --> 00:51:51,893
Oh, thank you sir

716
00:51:52,018 --> 00:51:52,685

717
00:51:56,009 --> 00:52:01,112
[phone vibrates]

718
00:52:01,879 --> 00:52:07,122
[phone continues vibrating]

719
00:52:10,268 --> 00:52:10,893
Hello...

720
00:52:11,060 --> 00:52:13,893
Hi, this is Afreen. Is this Roshan?

721
00:52:14,102 --> 00:52:14,685
No.

722
00:52:14,977 --> 00:52:16,143
Can I speak to Roshan?

723
00:52:16,518 --> 00:52:17,977
No, he is busy.

724
00:52:19,602 --> 00:52:21,143
May I know whom I am talking to?

725
00:52:21,185 --> 00:52:23,018
This is father of Roshan, Krishna Murali

726
00:52:24,102 --> 00:52:27,060
Engineer in irrigation department.
Do you want some more information?

727
00:52:27,435 --> 00:52:30,143
Can you please ask Roshan to call me once?

728
00:52:30,352 --> 00:52:32,227
-Is it important?
-Yes Sir.

729
00:52:33,268 --> 00:52:37,768
He does not know who I am,
he helped me once.

730
00:52:38,643 --> 00:52:40,352
I need to thank him.

731
00:52:40,893 --> 00:52:43,727

If required I am ready either to
die or kill for the word given,

915
01:08:40,177 --> 01:08:40,927
Understood?

916
01:08:42,302 --> 01:08:45,718
Wipe out the thought of marrying anybody
else other than Nadir from your heart.

917
01:08:46,760 --> 01:08:49,302
That will not happen
till I am alive Afreen.

918
01:08:49,468 --> 01:08:50,385
Oh God...

919
01:08:51,218 --> 01:08:52,843
Ask Nadir to forgive you.

920
01:08:52,968 --> 01:08:56,157
Come here!
Ask Nadir for forgiveness Afreen!

921

924
01:09:08,843 --> 01:09:10,260
Why did you change Afreen?

925
01:09:11,802 --> 01:09:12,343
Tell me...

926
01:09:14,343 --> 01:09:15,760
Don't you like me?

927
01:09:16,677 --> 01:09:19,218
Don't you know how much I like you?

928
01:09:20,177 --> 01:09:21,677
You are a small kid.

929
01:09:21,863 --> 01:09:22,627
Please... [gasps]

930
01:09:23,427 --> 01:09:26,010

We are living every day in fear.

None knows what would happen any moment...

937
01:09:58,010 --> 01:10:03,160
Military people camping in
the peaceful Kandiwara...

938
01:10:04,051 --> 01:10:05,619
...is further frightening.

[chopper engines thumping]
[footsteps marching]

1082
01:26:00,093 --> 01:26:03,143
Sir, Indian Military will
not counter attack right away

1083
01:26:03,468 --> 01:26:06,385
because lives of the villagers
here are in our control

1084
01:26:06,927 --> 01:26:11,052
But how long would they wait Sir?
They would attack on us some day

1085
01:26:11,552 --> 01:26:14,052
And till then this village is safe, over

1086
01:26:35,635 --> 01:26:36,677
What is written here?

1087
01:26:38,802 --> 01:26:42,052
No one loves the soldier
until the enemy is at the gate

1088
01:26:44,135 --> 01:26:48,385
No one loves a soldier until
they see the enemy at the border

1089
01:26:49,302 --> 01:26:53,510
Who knows,
that enemy may be loving that same soldier

1090
01:26:54,760 --> 01:26:57,718
If such love happens,
what would you say in your language?

1091
01:27:01,135 --> 01:27:04,552
I am in love with you...

1092
01:27:08,135 --> 01:27:11,885
"I am in love with you... "

1093
01:27:38,135 --> 01:27:41,760
A dead body is found in the Snow
Mountains of India Pakistan border

1094
01:27:41,802 --> 01:27:45,510
This corpse is still safe
even after so many years.

1095
01:27:45,593 --> 01:27:48,343
It looks like there is

As per our sources this corpse belongs
to a girl from Gandivara village

1097
01:27:53,724 --> 01:27:56,915

1103
01:28:29,802 --> 01:28:33,885
Hello uncle, are you fine? Please come

1104
01:28:35,760 --> 01:28:37,218
Please have the sweets

1105
01:28:37,927 --> 01:28:39,552
Yes, what will you have?

1106
01:28:41,552 --> 01:28:44,468
Sayyad, see if Nadir is ready?

1107
01:28:44,677 --> 01:28:45,427
Yes, I will see.

1108
01:28:47,635 --> 01:28:49,593
Yes bro, he is ready in five minutes

Naseem, increase the volume

1112
01:29:07,343 --> 01:29:09,302
Two lovers have taken birth again.

1113
01:29:09,593 --> 01:29:11,177
Roshan and Afreen!

1114
01:29:14,260 --> 01:29:19,177
One Pakistani has become Indian and
an Indian has become a Pakistani

1115
01:29:21,302 --> 01:29:24,677
This dead body of 46 years
old is created a sensation

1116
01:29:29,260 --> 01:29:33,385
From the book found in the hands of
dead body, a love story has come out

1117
01:29:35,343 --> 01:29:39,510
What is the secret behind this love story?
Knowing this would be interesting

1118
01:29:39,927 --> 01:29:45,802
The lover boy taking birth again finding
the corpse of this girl is surprised all

1119
01:29:46,009 --> 01:29:47,677
His name is Roshan.

1120
01:29:47,843 --> 01:29:49,138
-The Pakistani boy in last life
-Hubby...

1121
01:29:49,478 --> 01:29:50,991
-Our son.
-...has taken birth now in India.

1122
01:29:51,343 --> 01:29:53,593
The Indian girl in that
birth is now born in Pakistan

1123
01:29:53,677 --> 01:29:57,385
The boy Roshan is with us now as you see

Afreen

1125
01:30:09,635 --> 01:30:12,052
Afreen, do you remember me?
We are born again

1126
01:30:14,869 --> 01:30:18,396
This is your house... and I am
talking standing before your house

1127
01:30:25,968 --> 01:30:28,343
You used to stay here with
your mom and dad, you remember?

1128
01:30:29,843 --> 01:30:32,177
Afreen, please respond.
I don't know where you are?

1129
01:30:32,468 --> 01:30:33,135
Afreen...

01:30:34,593 --> 01:30:35,385
Please...

1131
01:30:36,427 --> 01:30:37,593
What is this?

1132
01:30:39,552 --> 01:30:40,552
What is this?

1133
01:30:41,927 --> 01:30:43,635
This nonsense running on the TV...

1134
01:30:44,385 --> 01:30:44,885
Here...

1135
01:30:44,927 --> 01:30:47,010
Khan Sir, she used to say in childhood

1136
01:30:47,427 --> 01:30:50,427
Mom... I remember something

1137
01:30:50,552 --> 01:30:51,635
What do you remember?

1138
01:30:51,718 --> 01:30:53,052
I was dead

1139
01:30:54,343 --> 01:30:56,677
I saw it with my own eyes.

1140
01:30:56,885 --> 01:30:59,593
She used to tremble and wake
up from sleep so many nights

1141
01:30:59,677 --> 01:31:02,510
Similarly,
she used to sing songs she never heard

1142
01:31:02,593 --> 01:31:04,468
But I never believed her.

1143
01:31:04,593 --> 01:31:08,218
-But seeing all these...
-You stop talking crazily

1144
01:31:10,343 --> 01:31:13,135
We believe that a
human gets just one life.

1145
01:31:14,802 --> 01:31:18,433
Human is born once,
dies once and if god wishes...

1146
01:31:18,633 --> 01:31:20,766
...he gets to heaven and the story ends

1147
01:31:21,093 --> 01:31:24,635
-But seeing all these happenings, she...
-Mumtaj, enough!

1148
01:31:26,218 --> 01:31:27,302
Enough!

1149
01:31:28,385 --> 01:31:29,468
What is all this?

1150
01:31:30,177 --> 01:31:32,718
Did you ever meet this boy?
Do you remember anything?

1151
01:31:33,010 --> 01:31:33,552
-What I am asking is...
-Come on...

1152
01:31:33,593 --> 01:31:35,302
What would she say Khan Sir?

1153
01:31:35,885 --> 01:31:40,343
I told you earlier that she is
roaming with some guy in India.

1154
01:31:40,510 --> 01:31:42,593
Control your tongue and speak Nadir,
I am talking here

1155
01:31:43,427 --> 01:31:44,434
-Afreen, what I am asking is...
[groans]

1156
01:31:44,760 --> 01:31:47,635
Nadir... Nadir, stop it

1157
01:31:49,177 --> 01:31:54,802
Did only he remember the
whole flash back or even you?

1158
01:31:55,266 --> 01:31:56,521
Huh? Tell me...

1159
01:31:56,802 --> 01:31:58,343
Nadir, what are you doing?

1160
01:31:59,177 --> 01:32:00,093
-Leave her
-Let go of her.

1161
01:32:03,809 --> 01:32:06,968
Even he caught my neck like this that day.

1162
01:32:07,802 --> 01:32:08,593
Who?

1163
01:32:09,643 --> 01:32:10,777
Hawaldar

1164
01:32:11,920 --> 01:32:13,265
Hey Indian...

1165
01:32:14,071 --> 01:32:19,235
Since I saw you, I am gone
sleepless in the nights from then

1166
01:32:21,302 --> 01:32:25,718
You do not like me? You want that guy huh?

1167
01:32:27,098 --> 01:32:28,591
You need him? Huh?

1168
01:32:29,520 --> 01:32:30,216
Hmm...

1172
01:32:42,189 --> 01:32:43,527
you need that fellow?

[empty gun shot]

1176
01:33:01,831 --> 01:33:04,383
If the bullet is shot this time,

1177
01:33:05,603 --> 01:33:06,422
you are gone.

1178
01:33:11,322 --> 01:33:14,460
I will not leave you, understood?

1179
01:33:15,585 --> 01:33:16,585
I will not leave.

1180
01:33:17,895 --> 01:33:19,835
I will take him for sure.

1181
01:33:22,532 --> 01:33:24,290
I mean your lover...

1182
01:33:25,393 --> 01:33:27,380
I will finish him for sure.

1183
01:33:27,812 --> 01:33:28,502
What will I do?

1184
01:33:29,822 --> 01:33:30,918
I will kill him.

1185
01:33:50,437 --> 01:33:51,290
What are you writing?

1186
01:33:52,067 --> 01:33:52,721
Diary.

1187
01:33:54,839 --> 01:33:55,502
What is written here?

1188
01:33:56,113 --> 01:33:59,229
I feel like killing all the
Pakistan Military people.

1189
01:34:00,813 --> 01:34:02,341
What have we done wrong to them?

1190
01:34:03,488 --> 01:34:06,165
Are these humans or demons?

1191
01:34:09,601 --> 01:34:10,182
Read this.

1192
01:34:12,215 --> 01:34:14,185
I do not know even the
name of that soldier.

1193
01:34:15,109 --> 01:34:20,002
But when he was taking punishment
for me, my eyes went damp.

1194
01:34:21,874 --> 01:34:26,168
I then understood that... there are
humans with heart even in Pakistan.

1195
01:34:31,154 --> 01:34:31,877
What are you writing now?

1196
01:34:32,427 --> 01:34:36,043
It would have been great if
these borders never existed.

1197
01:34:37,298 --> 01:34:41,335
It would have been much
great if he was not a Muslim.

1198
01:34:43,023 --> 01:34:44,168
Whichever may be the Nation,

1199
01:34:45,636 --> 01:34:49,668
what more would be a greater
respect than to love a soldier?

1200
01:34:50,312 --> 01:34:53,752
Only the soldier has a
heart to love the country.

1201
01:34:54,349 --> 01:34:57,668
Enough to get even a
small space in that heart.

1202
01:34:57,780 --> 01:34:59,002
I will live on happily.

1203
01:34:59,561 --> 01:35:02,174

1213
01:36:52,668 --> 01:36:53,835
Why are you hitting me?

1214

Sir, why do you want to kill me?

The moment when that girl liked
you, I fixed to kill you rascal.

1219
01:37:17,699 --> 01:37:21,293

me, I will not leave her.

There.

1230
01:38:52,371 --> 01:38:52,918
What is this?

1231
01:38:53,791 --> 01:38:57,085
I prayed God that nothing
should happen to you in the war.

1232
01:38:57,241 --> 01:38:58,085
Nothing will happen to me,

1233
01:38:59,138 --> 01:39:00,127
because the war is over.

1234
01:39:00,910 --> 01:39:01,918
Is the war over?

1235
01:39:02,864 --> 01:39:04,127
What will happen now?

1236
01:39:05,496 --> 01:39:06,210
We will leave.

1237
01:39:10,725 --> 01:39:13,877
All these days,
I was frightened about war.

1238
01:39:15,656 --> 01:39:21,127
But now,
I feel it was good if war still continued.

1239
01:39:21,845 --> 01:39:22,377
Why?

1240
01:39:23,101 --> 01:39:25,293
Because you will be before my eyes.

1241
01:39:28,892 --> 01:39:29,752
War is over there,

1242
01:39:31,366 --> 01:39:32,835
but the war has started here now.

1243
01:39:34,753 --> 01:39:39,085
Because it is very easy
to start love and a war,

1244
01:39:40,505 --> 01:39:42,002
but it is very tough to stop that.

1245
01:39:42,316 --> 01:39:43,127
It's very tough.

1246
01:39:49,206 --> 01:39:51,668
I just understood how tough it is.

1247
01:39:53,739 --> 01:39:57,377
I cannot bear this
distance in between us both.

1248
01:39:59,308 --> 01:40:03,918
You were seen very far away
while seeing you from a distance

1249
01:40:04,668 --> 01:40:07,043
and thus I used to come near you.

1250
01:40:08,159 --> 01:40:11,589
Now though I am beside you,
I feel to be very far away.

1251
01:40:12,928 --> 01:40:16,148
My heart has no satisfaction
however close I am with you.

1252
01:40:17,008 --> 01:40:18,252
I am frightened.

1253
01:40:20,951 --> 01:40:22,085
I too am frightened.

1254
01:40:22,698 --> 01:40:27,835
Even to blink, because I may miss
seeing you even for that one second.

1255
01:40:29,821 --> 01:40:33,460
There are so many stars, so many planets,

1256
01:40:34,502 --> 01:40:37,085
200 countries and seven
seas in this Universe.

1257
01:40:38,236 --> 01:40:39,793
God gave you to me between all these.

1258
01:40:41,567 --> 01:40:43,335
I will be grateful to that God for it.

1259
01:40:44,027 --> 01:40:45,850
Not just for making us meet,

1260
01:40:46,638 --> 01:40:50,406
pray your God to keep
us together for lifelong.

1261
01:40:54,542 --> 01:40:55,220
I cannot ask,

1262
01:40:57,700 --> 01:40:58,805
Today is the last day.

1263
01:41:02,885 --> 01:41:06,747
No idea whether we meet again or not.

1264
01:41:08,575 --> 01:41:09,460
Tomorrow is the Refugee exchange.

1267
01:42:03,595 --> 01:42:05,752
No idea whether we have
another life or not

1268
01:42:06,752 --> 01:42:08,374
It is just this night left out.

1269

Afreen likes this marriage.

02:03:48,899 --> 02:03:50,793
We are not doing a
marriage which she does not like.

1546
02:03:51,187 --> 02:03:55,085
If that is true,
ask her to say that in front of all here.

You are saying a lie.

It is written even in
your Islam, right sir?

02:04:03,190 --> 02:04:05,627
Any girl should be asked
about her wish before marriage.

You agree or no.

This is the right of a girl sir.

It is written in Quran
and Shahi Muslim Hadith.

Respect your Islam sir,
respect your daughter.

02:04:25,093 --> 02:04:27,627
You ask your daughter
about what she wants.

This is our rule.

02:04:30,253 --> 02:04:32,293

this marriage is on with her willingness.

1561
02:04:32,907 --> 02:04:34,793
Still, I will ask her once again for you.

1563
02:04:37,767 --> 02:04:38,252
No.

1564
02:04:38,751 --> 02:04:40,085
Hey, she is saying a lie.

1565
02:04:40,178 --> 02:04:41,168
She is saying the truth.

1566
02:04:42,364 --> 02:04:44,668
What she is saying is true and do not
get her married against to her will sir.

1567
02:04:45,283 --> 02:04:46,043
Oh God!

1568
02:04:47,526 --> 02:04:49,668
I will never get a marriage done
to my daughter against to her will.

1569
02:04:52,378 --> 02:04:54,877
But I cannot give my daughter
even to a stranger like you.

1570
02:04:57,589 --> 02:04:58,293
Why should I give?

1571
02:05:01,932 --> 02:05:04,293
I am reborn again for your daughter.

1572
02:05:07,610 --> 02:05:08,918
Is this one reason not enough sir?

1573
02:05:14,959 --> 02:05:15,627
What is your profession?

1574
02:05:16,153 --> 02:05:19,168

See, he is from Indian Military it seems.

If we leave him like this today, he will
come with a gun tomorrow and kill us all.

-He has so much revenge on us.
-Nadir, one minute.

You are a Hindu and an Indian.

1579
02:05:38,802 --> 02:05:41,418
Do you have at least a bit of
respect on Islam religion in your heart?

1580
02:05:42,293 --> 02:05:44,043
-I do respect.
-Thank God.

1581
02:05:45,582 --> 02:05:48,002
Are you ready to take up Islam
religion for my daughter?

1621
02:08:33,166 --> 02:08:33,960
They hit me

1622
02:08:35,218 --> 02:08:36,252

taking to Police station.

02:08:40,724 --> 02:08:42,710

-Say Hi!
-Hi!

1626
02:08:46,752 --> 02:08:48,960
I felt bad like the same when I was
getting separated then from Madhira.

1627
02:08:50,377 --> 02:08:52,377

1629
02:09:00,388 --> 02:09:01,585
She was crying there for me.

1630
02:09:03,327 --> 02:09:04,960
I did not like the fence in between us.

1632
02:09:09,043 --> 02:09:09,877

Not just Afreen but the
God likes me too a lot.

1634
02:09:20,252 --> 02:09:22,457
Thus he gave a second
chance to jump over...

1635
02:09:22,657 --> 02:09:23,610
Why will I let go?

1636
02:09:24,127 --> 02:09:26,002
