1
00:02:16,116 --> 00:02:19,745
Entire Wednesday is a
holiday at Shantiniketan

2
00:02:20,353 --> 00:02:23,516
and today at 10 a.m.
In the morning...

3
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:26,491
when the room was
opened it was detected

4
00:02:36,403 --> 00:02:38,701
It is a matter of
deep concern that...

5
00:02:40,674 --> 00:02:52,552
Tagore's Nobel medal which
was stolen from here...

6
00:03:01,461 --> 00:03:03,486
We want the Nobel back...

7
00:03:08,101 --> 00:03:09,898
I am shocked!! Most shocking...

8
00:03:10,403 --> 00:03:13,634
Its unthinkable...

9
00:03:14,307 --> 00:03:20,906
It is a shame which hurts us all

10
00:03:22,282 --> 00:03:25,774
I think there is a high
level conspiracy behind this.

11
00:03:26,486 --> 00:03:28,283
I think Tagore has been
stolen for quite sometime...

12
00:03:28,355 --> 00:03:30,186
...his ideals...
his thoughts

13
00:03:30,657 --> 00:03:33,125
The Nobel medal is
after all just an emblem.

14
00:03:33,927 --> 00:03:36,225
But where are his ideals now?

15
00:03:36,363 --> 00:03:41,630
The institution which was...

16
00:03:42,335 --> 00:03:49,673
...in charge of security
needs to be blamed

17
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:54,940
How can it be kept in
such utter casualness?

18
00:03:55,649 --> 00:03:59,779
I can't even fathom

19
00:04:00,687 --> 00:04:02,177
This is a national shame.

20
00:04:02,756 --> 00:04:04,815
We are trying everything
possible from the government...

21
00:04:04,891 --> 00:04:07,359
so that we can arrest the culprits.

22
00:04:08,194 --> 00:04:10,253
Our CM is extremely
worried about the incident.

23
00:04:10,764 --> 00:04:14,097
Do you see a foreign hand in this?

24
00:04:14,301 --> 00:04:19,170
Absolutely! We are not
leaving any clue out.

25
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:20,770
Central government conspiracy?

26
00:04:21,107 --> 00:04:22,665
As I said, everything is possible.

27
00:04:22,909 --> 00:04:25,571
We are tapping
Interpol, CBI everyone...

28
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:29,440
Is Amartya Sen's
Nobel here or abroad?

29
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:31,373
I will ask.

30
00:04:31,718 --> 00:04:32,912
And Satyajit Ray's Nobel?

31
00:04:33,286 --> 00:04:36,312
I hear that the guards were
dozing when the theft happened?

32
00:04:36,489 --> 00:04:38,457
I don't know how I
will live from hereon.

33
00:04:38,858 --> 00:04:42,385
As if Tagore died once more...

34
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:45,625
Sorry... whose Nobel?

35
00:05:01,514 --> 00:05:03,448
O dear Robi Tagore...

36
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:07,711
I will take you to
our village this summer

37
00:05:28,475 --> 00:05:30,739
The city plays with you

38
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:33,472
and makes you sleep by
making bridges in your name.

39
00:05:54,801 --> 00:05:57,167
They have made
roads in your name...

40
00:05:57,237 --> 00:05:58,932
...to only burn you out in the sun

41
00:06:03,176 --> 00:06:07,670
I will not bear that pain anymore

42
00:06:26,733 --> 00:06:29,600
You will enjoy yourself
in the village I promise

43
00:06:29,869 --> 00:06:32,235
We are dark skinned people

44
00:06:37,844 --> 00:06:40,369
We have our nice
courtyards outside our huts

45
00:06:40,547 --> 00:06:45,416
We will not let you
go to the city anymore

46
00:06:45,552 --> 00:06:48,146
I plead you...

47
00:06:48,288 --> 00:06:52,884
We won’t listen any more

48
00:07:31,731 --> 00:07:33,892
So, this step is also
the same as before.

49
00:07:34,634 --> 00:07:38,297
5 x 6 = 30

50
00:07:39,773 --> 00:07:44,210
5 x 5 = 25

51
00:07:45,411 --> 00:07:48,312
3 x 5 = 15

52
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:53,217
Who the hell is it? Who?

53
00:08:09,369 --> 00:08:11,064
Hey Manmatho...

54
00:08:12,672 --> 00:08:15,300
...wait and see what I do to you

55
00:08:20,113 --> 00:08:21,341
Stop this craziness now!

56
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:33,553
Classes over! Classes over...

57
00:08:34,861 --> 00:08:38,262
Oye... You tell your
dad to see me at once.

58
00:08:38,698 --> 00:08:39,790
You think I don't understand
anything is it?

59
00:08:39,866 --> 00:08:49,673
School over...
Freedom... Break free...

60
00:09:11,264 --> 00:09:12,595
Why don't you sleep on your side?

61
00:09:12,732 --> 00:09:14,597
How can one sleep
with such snoring...

62
00:09:23,176 --> 00:09:26,373
Who is it?

63
00:09:29,282 --> 00:09:31,876
Why don't you go and see?
Maybe thieves...

64
00:09:32,218 --> 00:09:35,449
What will the thieves take?
There is nothing to take.

65
00:09:58,811 --> 00:10:02,144
Who is it? Let me see your face.

66
00:10:05,451 --> 00:10:06,850
What happened to you guys now?

67
00:10:08,521 --> 00:10:10,250
Whom are you barking at?

68
00:11:00,873 --> 00:11:05,537
See... I got this outside.

69
00:11:08,414 --> 00:11:10,279
Is this gold? Let me see...

70
00:11:10,483 --> 00:11:11,745
Where are you taking it?

71
00:11:12,218 --> 00:11:14,379
To my mother's house.
The way you behave sometimes...

72
00:11:14,487 --> 00:11:15,818
Let me see...

73
00:11:16,222 --> 00:11:18,247
Now you shut up...

74
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:21,658
Can you please make a
jewellery for me with this?

75
00:11:21,761 --> 00:11:22,729
Stop it.

76
00:11:22,729 --> 00:11:25,926
First let me find out
Let me see it

77
00:11:26,265 --> 00:11:28,233
You wait now.
Let me see it properly

78
00:11:31,671 --> 00:11:32,797
Give that to me...

79
00:11:33,172 --> 00:11:36,141
Don't show it to any stranger...
where are you off to?

80
00:11:39,512 --> 00:11:40,501
Master...

81
00:11:42,715 --> 00:11:45,775
Bhanu? What?
This early in the morning?

82
00:11:46,486 --> 00:11:48,852
Who else is there for me to go to?

83
00:11:49,522 --> 00:11:51,581
Why... What happened?

84
00:11:52,725 --> 00:11:55,922
When I went for my
bath in the morning...

85
00:11:56,629 --> 00:11:58,290
I got this by the well side

86
00:11:58,798 --> 00:12:00,891
It looks like gold...

87
00:12:01,234 --> 00:12:03,168
...but I am not sure

88
00:12:10,843 --> 00:12:13,744
Bhanu... Bhanu!!

89
00:12:14,414 --> 00:12:15,745
What Master? What?

90
00:12:17,383 --> 00:12:20,580
Bhanu... you don't know
what you have chanced upon

91
00:12:24,157 --> 00:12:25,920
See... see today's newspaper.

92
00:12:26,392 --> 00:12:29,122
There has been a theft from
Rabi Tagore's residence

93
00:12:30,196 --> 00:12:31,185
Theft?

94
00:12:31,597 --> 00:12:32,894
What did you understand?

95
00:12:33,199 --> 00:12:35,793
Theft? Rabi? Our neighbour?

96
00:12:36,169 --> 00:12:43,666
Oh No... This is the
great Rabindranath Tagore

97
00:12:46,779 --> 00:12:48,269
What are you looking at?

98
00:12:49,649 --> 00:12:50,877
What are you looking at?

99
00:12:52,685 --> 00:12:54,710
Listen to this,
I am reading it to you...

100
00:12:55,755 --> 00:12:57,552
"The Nobel medal and
other precious things...

101
00:12:57,623 --> 00:12:59,784
...were stolen yesterday
from Shantiniketan

102
00:13:01,327 --> 00:13:04,694
Yesterday night the
Nobel Prize was stolen

103
00:13:06,099 --> 00:13:08,499
There is a national
uproar over the theft...

104
00:13:09,402 --> 00:13:11,563
...and the Nobel is with whom?

105
00:13:13,272 --> 00:13:14,261
With whom?

106
00:13:17,243 --> 00:13:21,111
With our Bhanu Kumar Hudati.

107
00:13:21,848 --> 00:13:26,512
But I did not steal it...
believe me...

108
00:13:28,121 --> 00:13:30,817
I know... I know...
Of course you didn't.

109
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:33,681
But what is this?
Rabi Tagore's what?

110
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,789
Nobel Prize you dummy...
Nobel Prize.

111
00:13:39,499 --> 00:13:42,195
The most valuable
award in the world.

112
00:13:43,169 --> 00:13:46,229
So for what did
Tagore get this award?

113
00:13:46,672 --> 00:13:49,436
For what?
Ask for what not.

114
00:13:50,176 --> 00:13:54,636
His philosophy,
his realizations... his songs...

115
00:13:55,381 --> 00:13:58,748
...his prose... his poems...
his values...

116
00:13:59,185 --> 00:14:01,676
which ones will I leave out?

117
00:14:02,722 --> 00:14:04,553
Yes... yes. I understand values...

118
00:14:04,824 --> 00:14:10,126
Onions are 8 rupees kilo, when
I buy rice I understand values...

119
00:14:10,563 --> 00:14:12,588
Oh... not that.

120
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:16,529
How can I make you understand?
Don't bother.

121
00:14:18,104 --> 00:14:18,798
Listen,

122
00:14:19,739 --> 00:14:26,167
let’s take a decision after talking
to the other elders of our village.

123
00:14:26,913 --> 00:14:30,144
So what will I do?
Shall I return it?

124
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:31,572
Definitely

125
00:14:32,652 --> 00:14:36,144
But why will they believe you
if you simply return this back?

126
00:14:37,657 --> 00:14:41,388
Can you prove that you
have not stolen this?

127
00:14:42,929 --> 00:14:43,918
Come here.

128
00:14:46,265 --> 00:14:50,895
There is a proper way
to return this also

129
00:14:52,305 --> 00:14:56,571
Now, if you just take it... they
will first put you behind bars

130
00:14:57,777 --> 00:15:00,439
...then you have to go the court,
police... it will be a mess.

131
00:15:00,746 --> 00:15:03,237
For now keep it...
No, no... rather keep it with you.

132
00:15:03,416 --> 00:15:04,883
I am scared of the police

133
00:15:05,184 --> 00:15:07,379
Keep it I say.

134
00:15:09,355 --> 00:15:15,351
Let's meet with the
village elders in the evening.

135
00:15:17,096 --> 00:15:21,192
Then we shall decide.

136
00:15:22,668 --> 00:15:25,728
Now go. I will be late for school.

137
00:15:25,805 --> 00:15:28,239
Shall I take this newspaper Master?

138
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:33,874
What will you do with
this? You can’t even read.

139
00:15:34,213 --> 00:15:35,510
I will just show it to my wife...

140
00:15:35,681 --> 00:15:39,310
what is the exact
value of this to us?

141
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:45,388
Value? This is our
national pride...

142
00:15:45,825 --> 00:15:49,488
Wow... National pride... with me?

143
00:16:44,884 --> 00:16:48,149
There has been a theft
in the kings palace...

144
00:16:48,321 --> 00:16:49,879
...find the thief everyone

145
00:16:50,389 --> 00:16:51,617
Find the thief.

146
00:17:05,338 --> 00:17:07,829
Whoever it might be...

147
00:17:08,307 --> 00:17:09,706
Find the thief.

148
00:17:51,317 --> 00:17:54,343
They escaped across the river
and then through the village.

149
00:17:54,587 --> 00:17:55,576
We have traced footprints.

150
00:17:55,621 --> 00:17:57,851
We have ordered combing
operation in the village also...

151
00:17:59,492 --> 00:18:01,756
We have to give a press
statement in the evening.

152
00:18:03,062 --> 00:18:05,462
So please send the updates
to the office by then.

153
00:18:06,699 --> 00:18:09,862
And don't talk to
the press or media.

154
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:14,867
We have to submit it to
the right people concerned

155
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:19,807
someone from the ministry
or some high level official.

156
00:18:20,246 --> 00:18:23,306
Bhanu will receive a hefty
prize from the government

157
00:18:23,849 --> 00:18:26,613
he will return it his photo
will appear in the newspaper

158
00:18:26,685 --> 00:18:28,346
villagers will rejoice

159
00:18:28,854 --> 00:18:30,116
So what?

160
00:18:32,158 --> 00:18:36,117
Why will Bhanu give this back?

161
00:18:36,495 --> 00:18:37,484
What?

162
00:18:39,265 --> 00:18:41,358
How much reward do you
think will they give Bhanu?

163
00:18:42,535 --> 00:18:44,867
Maybe a few hundred
thousands maybe 3 or 5?

164
00:18:46,439 --> 00:18:48,634
On the contrary if he sells this

165
00:18:49,175 --> 00:18:50,369
Sell it???

166
00:18:52,278 --> 00:18:55,213
I will not be surprised if the
value of this thing is in millions...

167
00:18:55,514 --> 00:18:57,141
Millions???

168
00:18:57,850 --> 00:18:59,215
Yes...

169
00:18:59,452 --> 00:19:04,185
Government, police everyone
is after this medal.

170
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:06,688
Government? Police?

171
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:09,727
What did they do for us?

172
00:19:11,197 --> 00:19:13,358
We all know the
condition of our village.

173
00:19:14,366 --> 00:19:16,334
Just besides Tagore's home.

174
00:19:16,869 --> 00:19:18,837
...farmers are
killing themselves,

175
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,603
politicians are toying with us

176
00:19:25,377 --> 00:19:27,072
villagers are being killed

177
00:19:28,781 --> 00:19:30,544
prices are sky rocketing

178
00:19:32,551 --> 00:19:34,542
when people can't
eat a square meal...

179
00:19:35,488 --> 00:19:38,616
then what is the harm if our village
can be uplifted by selling this Nobel?

180
00:19:39,358 --> 00:19:41,155
Please don't get so
excited Shyamal babu

181
00:19:42,194 --> 00:19:44,162
lts difficult not to
get excited Master.

182
00:19:45,264 --> 00:19:46,891
You know the condition
of our village.

183
00:19:48,701 --> 00:19:50,225
Today Tagore is not amongst us...

184
00:19:51,303 --> 00:19:54,295
otherwise he would also
have sold the medal and...

185
00:19:55,341 --> 00:19:57,241
thought about the plight of us.

186
00:19:58,811 --> 00:19:59,800
His values

187
00:20:00,179 --> 00:20:01,305
Yes... value is very high,

188
00:20:02,481 --> 00:20:04,506
Onions are rupees 8 per kilo rice is

189
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:05,810
Shut up Bhanu!

190
00:20:06,552 --> 00:20:09,112
But how can you dare to
sell Tagore's Nobel?

191
00:20:09,288 --> 00:20:11,813
There cannot be anything which is more
disgusting and insulting than this.

192
00:20:12,157 --> 00:20:15,126
Rather if the medal is
of real use to people...

193
00:20:15,528 --> 00:20:17,462
...then that will
give it its true worth

194
00:20:18,731 --> 00:20:20,562
It was lying in the museum...

195
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,892
and people used to stand
in queues and watch it.

196
00:20:26,272 --> 00:20:28,502
Bhanu can change the
face of our village.

197
00:20:30,409 --> 00:20:31,933
Moreover, Bhanu did not steal it.

198
00:20:32,678 --> 00:20:35,875
Really I didn't.
You can ask my wife

199
00:20:36,315 --> 00:20:37,646
in the night

200
00:20:37,716 --> 00:20:40,378
Master. Why don't you
tell what we should do.

201
00:20:40,786 --> 00:20:44,313
You are a learned man you decide.

202
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:49,293
What else shall I say?

203
00:20:50,596 --> 00:20:52,860
For the last 50 years I
have been trying to impart...

204
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,699
values on duty, ideals
and what is right.

205
00:20:59,505 --> 00:21:02,804
We heard all the view points both
sides have logic to what they said.

206
00:21:03,475 --> 00:21:11,439
But I think we should
also ask Bhanu about this.

207
00:21:11,917 --> 00:21:13,578
Tell us now Bhanu Shingho?

208
00:21:14,186 --> 00:21:18,555
Lts not Shingho Hudati.
My name is Bhanu Kumar Hudati.

209
00:21:18,824 --> 00:21:21,418
It's the same.
Now tell us. Come on

210
00:21:21,827 --> 00:21:23,317
What will I say?

211
00:21:23,696 --> 00:21:25,664
Please don't pressurize him.

212
00:21:26,465 --> 00:21:27,454
Listen Bhanu

213
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:36,430
I personally think you
should go to Kolkata and...

214
00:21:36,842 --> 00:21:39,640
give this to our Chief Minister.

215
00:21:40,846 --> 00:21:44,179
But how do I reach such
an important person?

216
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:46,875
We also can't say that from here.

217
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,448
Our village lad Hori is in Kolkata

218
00:21:52,424 --> 00:21:55,257
I will give you his
phone number and address.

219
00:21:56,195 --> 00:21:59,824
Go and contact him,
he will tell you.

220
00:22:01,533 --> 00:22:05,765
And what we have
decided that remains

221
00:22:05,838 --> 00:22:10,104
let this information be
absolutely amongst us.

222
00:22:10,609 --> 00:22:12,406
No one should come to know

223
00:22:12,678 --> 00:22:14,839
And we will tell the
other villagers...

224
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,147
that Bhanu is going to Kolkata
because he has won a lottery.

225
00:22:18,651 --> 00:22:20,744
That will not be
totally untrue also

226
00:22:21,587 --> 00:22:23,851
he will of course get a
reward along with the award.

227
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:27,650
Our village will become famous.

228
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:29,693
Our own Bhanu.

229
00:22:29,762 --> 00:22:32,492
Who is it?

230
00:22:35,534 --> 00:22:37,161
Bhanu wins lottery

231
00:22:40,839 --> 00:22:44,536
Bhanu wins lottery.

232
00:22:46,412 --> 00:22:52,612
Lottery lottery...
haha haha. Lottery

233
00:22:53,752 --> 00:22:55,549
O dear Rabi Tagore.

234
00:22:57,322 --> 00:23:00,257
I will take you to
our village this summer

235
00:23:01,694 --> 00:23:03,753
The city toys with you

236
00:23:04,763 --> 00:23:06,731
They make you sleep by
making bridges in your name,

237
00:23:07,332 --> 00:23:09,493
they have made roads in your name
to only burn you out in the sun

238
00:23:10,135 --> 00:23:12,399
I will not bear that pain anymore

239
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:16,767
O dear Rabi Tagore.

240
00:23:17,142 --> 00:23:20,373
I will take you to
our village this summer

241
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,345
O dear Rabi Tagore.

242
00:23:23,782 --> 00:23:26,808
I will take you to
our village this summer

243
00:23:28,787 --> 00:23:31,722
Rabi Tagore was a great man,

244
00:23:33,525 --> 00:23:36,323
If he was still alive we
would not have been like this.

245
00:23:37,563 --> 00:23:39,827
He got the Nobel

246
00:23:40,265 --> 00:23:42,426
would have got many more

247
00:23:42,735 --> 00:23:46,762
we would have collected them
and sold them to feed ourselves.

248
00:23:48,941 --> 00:23:52,900
Onions 8 rupees
kilo Rice 12 rupees...

249
00:23:58,784 --> 00:24:00,513
Have to go to Kolkata.

250
00:24:02,588 --> 00:24:04,556
They will give me some award.

251
00:24:05,891 --> 00:24:07,859
My photo will come
out in the papers

252
00:24:08,694 --> 00:24:11,219
Why? What have you done?

253
00:24:14,767 --> 00:24:16,291
I also don't know...

254
00:24:20,239 --> 00:24:21,763
But Shyamal da said.

255
00:24:24,143 --> 00:24:25,132
What?

256
00:24:25,711 --> 00:24:33,243
He said that if I sell
this I will get millions

257
00:24:35,154 --> 00:24:38,817
Millions? What are you saying?

258
00:24:39,158 --> 00:24:40,147
Yes

259
00:24:40,826 --> 00:24:45,126
If I sell this, then our
son's life will change,

260
00:24:47,166 --> 00:24:49,134
we can buy rice and
vegetables for us,

261
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:53,204
we can put tiles in our roof,

262
00:24:54,206 --> 00:24:56,800
I can buy a cycle.

263
00:24:57,876 --> 00:24:59,639
I will escape with both of you.

264
00:25:00,612 --> 00:25:05,675
What are you saying?

265
00:25:06,285 --> 00:25:08,082
But its someone else's thing

266
00:25:09,454 --> 00:25:12,287
lts Tagore's thing. It’s ours.

267
00:25:13,725 --> 00:25:15,090
How long can we exist like this.

268
00:25:15,494 --> 00:25:19,157
If Suren knows that
his father has sinned?

269
00:25:23,468 --> 00:25:24,526
Is it a sin?

270
00:25:26,638 --> 00:25:29,732
We will keep just a few thousands

271
00:25:30,709 --> 00:25:32,506
The rest we will
give it to our village

272
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:36,775
Will Tagore punish us for that?

273
00:25:37,616 --> 00:25:39,811
On the contrary.
But where will you sell it?

274
00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:42,147
Do you know?

275
00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:46,487
For that also I have
to go to Kolkata.

276
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:49,452
Could you find out
what is this thing?

277
00:25:50,395 --> 00:25:51,885
Something belonging to Tagore.

278
00:25:52,297 --> 00:25:53,559
Worth a lot.

279
00:25:54,499 --> 00:25:56,524
We illiterates won’t know
the true value of this.

280
00:25:57,135 --> 00:25:58,227
So who will?

281
00:25:59,671 --> 00:26:04,301
The Kolkata babu's
would understand for sure.

282
00:27:26,825 --> 00:27:31,762
This is Hori's
address and phone number

283
00:27:33,532 --> 00:27:37,366
Show this to anyone
and they will direct you

284
00:27:38,337 --> 00:27:41,602
I was thinking yesterday.

285
00:27:42,741 --> 00:27:44,436
Shyamal babu was also right

286
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:48,108
nobody has cared for our village.

287
00:27:50,248 --> 00:27:52,842
What Master? Did I
say something wrong?

288
00:27:54,219 --> 00:27:58,656
There are certain things which
don't have a right or wrong Bhanu

289
00:28:01,526 --> 00:28:02,652
Keep this.

290
00:28:04,863 --> 00:28:09,095
I have written a letter on your
behalf to the Chief Minister.

291
00:28:10,569 --> 00:28:13,697
Ensure that you deliver
this only to him.

292
00:28:16,274 --> 00:28:21,337
You have to do this
all by yourself.

293
00:28:24,116 --> 00:28:26,710
Return this and make us all proud.

294
00:28:29,855 --> 00:28:35,816
Whom do I trust and send with you?

295
00:28:36,595 --> 00:28:40,759
If I was younger I
would have gone with you.

296
00:28:42,234 --> 00:28:46,261
Master, I am having
a strange feeling

297
00:28:48,907 --> 00:28:49,896
Wait

298
00:29:03,522 --> 00:29:04,511
Take this.

299
00:29:06,324 --> 00:29:08,121
Don't ever part with this

300
00:29:12,164 --> 00:29:14,223
He will always be with you

301
00:29:16,201 --> 00:29:18,567
When you are in
danger pray to him...

302
00:29:19,204 --> 00:29:20,762
you will see
everything will be fine.

303
00:29:25,343 --> 00:29:27,573
O Monirul Miyadid you hear?

304
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,547
Bhanuda has won a lottery.

305
00:29:29,848 --> 00:29:30,837
Lottery?

306
00:29:31,516 --> 00:29:32,813
What? Battery?

307
00:29:33,118 --> 00:29:34,517
No, no, lottery.

308
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:43,827
My blessings are with you Bhanu.

309
00:29:44,162 --> 00:29:48,155
Apparently in Kolkata
there are good hearing aids

310
00:29:48,467 --> 00:29:51,493
please bring one for me.

311
00:29:52,471 --> 00:29:54,234
Can't hear at all these days

312
00:29:54,573 --> 00:29:56,541
but of course after you
are done with everything.

313
00:29:56,808 --> 00:29:58,901
After you get the lottery money

314
00:30:00,745 --> 00:30:03,179
Uncle, please build our playground.

315
00:30:03,515 --> 00:30:05,881
Go away now. Playground!!
Go and study first,

316
00:30:06,184 --> 00:30:09,551
otherwise you will end up
illiterate farmers like us

317
00:30:10,622 --> 00:30:13,785
why don't you install some
tube wells in the village.

318
00:30:14,359 --> 00:30:17,419
The crops are all
dying without water.

319
00:30:17,762 --> 00:30:20,196
You please take care of yourself.

320
00:30:20,565 --> 00:30:22,192
You are the pride
of our village now...

321
00:30:22,501 --> 00:30:24,264
we will all look up
to you from now on

322
00:30:30,842 --> 00:30:32,901
See that our son goes
to school regularly.

323
00:30:34,179 --> 00:30:37,478
Take care of
yourself... Lord protect him.

324
00:30:39,151 --> 00:30:40,743
Lord is there with me.

325
00:30:43,855 --> 00:30:46,346
Bhanu! Bhanu!

326
00:30:47,225 --> 00:30:49,591
Bhanu don't go

327
00:30:51,363 --> 00:30:52,853
Don't go Bhanu

328
00:30:56,735 --> 00:30:58,703
Come on... get down

329
00:31:17,422 --> 00:31:21,688
At the dawn of day Bhanu leaves...

330
00:31:28,767 --> 00:31:32,828
for an unknown land...

331
00:31:36,541 --> 00:31:41,478
with Tagore in his heart...

332
00:31:41,846 --> 00:31:46,874
...across the village shores

333
00:31:52,824 --> 00:31:57,693
At the dawn of day Bhanu leaves...

334
00:32:04,269 --> 00:32:08,171
for an unknown land...

335
00:32:08,473 --> 00:32:14,139
O traveler you
don't know your way...

336
00:32:14,579 --> 00:32:19,243
You keep wandering in
the maze of this world

337
00:32:30,362 --> 00:32:35,925
You don't know which is
day and which is night...

338
00:32:36,401 --> 00:32:41,464
you just dance to
the tune of destiny

339
00:33:10,568 --> 00:33:13,366
What are you looking like that for?

340
00:33:13,438 --> 00:33:14,632
No, actually Hori

341
00:33:14,773 --> 00:33:15,569
Who Hori?

342
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,471
Hori, from our village.

343
00:33:17,642 --> 00:33:20,202
There is no Hori here.
What's in the bag?

344
00:33:20,345 --> 00:33:24,213
Hori mean, there
are clothes... here

345
00:33:25,717 --> 00:33:28,584
Monu... look who is here.

346
00:33:28,753 --> 00:33:30,914
Here you are here is Hori

347
00:33:32,490 --> 00:33:34,390
I have been searching your house

348
00:33:34,526 --> 00:33:35,857
Master told me.

349
00:33:39,264 --> 00:33:40,458
Okay aunty I am going

350
00:33:40,598 --> 00:33:43,533
Go quickly lots of work to do.

351
00:33:44,903 --> 00:33:48,566
And my man is continually
asking for tea since morning

352
00:33:48,807 --> 00:33:50,331
I am telling Hori

353
00:33:50,442 --> 00:33:52,740
How will she understand Hori?
I am Jeet.

354
00:33:53,745 --> 00:33:55,337
Jeet? You?

355
00:33:56,314 --> 00:33:57,372
I changed my name

356
00:33:57,449 --> 00:33:58,814
Hori is not posh enough

357
00:33:59,451 --> 00:34:00,816
Come

358
00:34:01,753 --> 00:34:03,084
Sit

359
00:34:10,128 --> 00:34:12,392
Anyways, where is the thing?

360
00:34:12,797 --> 00:34:14,560
Give the bag to me
My wife...

361
00:34:14,799 --> 00:34:17,233
Let me keep the bag with me.

362
00:34:17,802 --> 00:34:19,531
I have heard about boudi a lot.

363
00:34:19,904 --> 00:34:21,667
Boudi? She is much younger than you

364
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:24,365
Come on... how does it matter?

365
00:34:24,776 --> 00:34:25,765
Isn't it boudi?

366
00:34:25,844 --> 00:34:30,144
Master called let us
see the real thing now.

367
00:34:30,548 --> 00:34:35,781
He just came. Let him
eat something first.

368
00:34:36,121 --> 00:34:37,554
So what?

369
00:34:48,333 --> 00:34:52,565
Wait wait let me close the windows

370
00:34:52,737 --> 00:34:54,762
Even windows have ears.

371
00:34:55,807 --> 00:34:57,672
You mean walls
Yes, 'walls'.

372
00:35:22,233 --> 00:35:23,894
Monu hold it once

373
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:27,201
Not me the Nobel

374
00:35:27,272 --> 00:35:30,400
No. I am scared to hold it

375
00:35:30,642 --> 00:35:32,803
Hold it, its harmless.

376
00:35:33,144 --> 00:35:34,611
Have you seen the weight?

377
00:35:34,712 --> 00:35:36,475
Lts from the British
period... pure gold.

378
00:35:36,848 --> 00:35:38,713
...if it was Indian then they
would have impured even this

379
00:35:39,651 --> 00:35:41,312
Hold this

380
00:35:49,327 --> 00:35:55,857
I have held a calling bell all sorts of
bells but a Nobel for the first time.

381
00:35:57,669 --> 00:35:58,658
Uncle!

382
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:17,518
My old lady is shouting
at me from morning...

383
00:36:17,755 --> 00:36:19,780
As if I have committed
a crime by asking for tea

384
00:36:21,259 --> 00:36:25,559
Please make a cup
of tea for me Monu.

385
00:36:33,905 --> 00:36:35,736
Bhanuda, our Nobel's...

386
00:36:36,207 --> 00:36:37,435
Villages.

387
00:36:37,542 --> 00:36:40,636
Have come to see
Kolkata haven't seen it ever...

388
00:36:40,812 --> 00:36:42,279
O yes Kolkata to see.

389
00:36:43,448 --> 00:36:47,350
Tea! Tea! I will
bring you tea uncle

390
00:36:50,622 --> 00:36:54,388
You know, this world
is an amazing place

391
00:36:55,326 --> 00:36:58,159
The more I see the
more stunned I become.

392
00:36:58,496 --> 00:37:02,227
There is the same news everywhere...
its stolen... its stolen...

393
00:37:03,701 --> 00:37:08,434
So you stole Rabindranath
Tagore's Nobel prize?

394
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:10,838
I did not steal I found
Found

395
00:37:11,809 --> 00:37:15,404
Found Kolkata many times

396
00:37:15,713 --> 00:37:18,648
Many times? But.

397
00:37:18,816 --> 00:37:20,340
What happened with your tea?

398
00:37:20,518 --> 00:37:21,542
Here... tea

399
00:37:27,392 --> 00:37:28,757
Shame shame.

400
00:37:29,394 --> 00:37:33,160
Next we will come to know that the
Victoria Memorial has been stolen

401
00:37:44,342 --> 00:37:45,775
Did you put ginger in the tea?

402
00:38:02,093 --> 00:38:03,720
No... No... Still searching

403
00:38:05,530 --> 00:38:07,225
The guy's name is Bhanu Hudati

404
00:38:09,801 --> 00:38:11,166
I didn't see him

405
00:38:13,605 --> 00:38:15,573
They say he won a lottery

406
00:38:17,609 --> 00:38:20,442
How will I know that?

407
00:38:24,616 --> 00:38:27,517
Who... Who is there?

408
00:38:41,499 --> 00:38:43,433
Just see the state
of Shantiniketan...

409
00:38:44,902 --> 00:38:46,301
Police is everywhere

410
00:38:47,372 --> 00:38:48,771
The heat is unbearable

411
00:38:50,341 --> 00:38:53,572
Well, then wait for
the peak summer to come

412
00:38:57,148 --> 00:38:58,706
There... the Nobel theft news

413
00:39:18,603 --> 00:39:21,071
Just wait and see... police will
find out the thief within a few days.

414
00:39:21,472 --> 00:39:23,303
They can do everything

415
00:39:23,841 --> 00:39:25,433
Once they find out the thief...

416
00:39:25,610 --> 00:39:27,601
...they will just bash him
up and find out the Nobel.

417
00:39:45,296 --> 00:39:48,288
Chief Minister? You mean?

418
00:39:50,368 --> 00:39:52,427
But Master said...

419
00:39:53,504 --> 00:39:59,739
O come on... reaching the Chief Minister
more difficult than reaching God...

420
00:40:00,878 --> 00:40:03,870
I am telling you... why don't
you sell it and then we...

421
00:40:04,515 --> 00:40:05,504
We?

422
00:40:05,683 --> 00:40:09,915
I mean you... and all
of us from the village...

423
00:40:11,556 --> 00:40:13,615
I will take my share here...

424
00:40:13,725 --> 00:40:15,886
No, no... that won’t be right...

425
00:40:16,794 --> 00:40:18,728
It’s not my thing... moreover
it's the nations pride...

426
00:40:19,197 --> 00:40:20,221
O come on...

427
00:40:24,769 --> 00:40:28,899
Bhanuda... millions
are being looted...

428
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:30,537
Don't you hear? Scam?

429
00:40:34,946 --> 00:40:36,880
People have become rich
by selling Tagore...

430
00:40:37,815 --> 00:40:41,876
why is it wrong if we sell the
Nobel and help needy people?

431
00:40:41,953 --> 00:40:43,420
Isn't it?

432
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:45,949
I understand everything...

433
00:40:46,524 --> 00:40:47,957
but it won’t be right.

434
00:40:49,761 --> 00:40:51,854
I will go...

435
00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:54,598
just tell me where his office is...

436
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,758
I will make him understand...

437
00:40:57,902 --> 00:40:59,733
...that the bell is with me

438
00:40:59,804 --> 00:41:00,736
Here... see

439
00:41:01,572 --> 00:41:03,597
Master has written a nice letter...

440
00:41:03,775 --> 00:41:06,107
Not Bell... Nobel.

441
00:41:09,413 --> 00:41:10,778
And you will roam around with
that medal or what?

442
00:41:10,915 --> 00:41:12,644
I will keep it with me always...

443
00:41:13,151 --> 00:41:14,880
will only hand it over
to the Chief Minister.

444
00:41:15,153 --> 00:41:16,643
Bhanuda... come on.

445
00:41:17,388 --> 00:41:19,618
Do you think that this is our
village? This is Kolkata...

446
00:41:19,924 --> 00:41:24,554
You will roam about
with this precious thing?

447
00:41:25,596 --> 00:41:27,496
Why don’t you take a
photo of it in the phone?

448
00:41:31,269 --> 00:41:34,466
Mobile... that's right.

449
00:41:34,672 --> 00:41:36,299
Saw how smart she is?

450
00:41:37,642 --> 00:41:39,200
And the medal?
Where do I keep that?

451
00:41:40,144 --> 00:41:42,305
We can keep that somewhere else...

452
00:41:42,513 --> 00:41:43,502
nobody will know that.

453
00:41:43,781 --> 00:41:45,339
You have proof that the
Nobel is indeed with you...

454
00:41:45,449 --> 00:41:46,643
...you can show the
photo on your phone

455
00:41:46,884 --> 00:41:48,476
You can then go wherever you like.

456
00:41:48,753 --> 00:41:50,948
Then lets go and
keep this medal now.

457
00:41:51,189 --> 00:41:52,178
Nope!

458
00:41:54,392 --> 00:41:55,791
You will go alone...

459
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:57,827
Absolutely no one should know...

460
00:41:58,896 --> 00:42:01,558
where the thing is... except you.

461
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:04,532
I don't know any
place here though...

462
00:42:05,336 --> 00:42:06,826
That I will tell you.

463
00:42:08,339 --> 00:42:10,432
Go and bury it inside
our Bengal's soil...

464
00:42:10,808 --> 00:42:13,834
Let Tagore be buried
in Bengal's soil.

465
00:42:15,546 --> 00:42:17,537
Smile!! Smile!!

466
00:42:22,687 --> 00:42:24,655
Come no boudi... you also come

467
00:42:25,289 --> 00:42:26,278
What will she do?

468
00:42:26,357 --> 00:42:27,346
Why?

469
00:42:27,525 --> 00:42:29,686
You are behaving as if we
are taking wedding snaps.

470
00:42:33,631 --> 00:42:36,429
One tall... one short... it's
not fitting in one frame

471
00:44:11,696 --> 00:44:13,630
How can this be possible Mr. Sen?

472
00:44:14,498 --> 00:44:16,261
Why was there so much
lapse in security?

473
00:44:16,667 --> 00:44:18,225
Don't you think you
should have been more...

474
00:44:18,402 --> 00:44:19,391
But Sir?

475
00:44:20,104 --> 00:44:22,368
Security was not completely ours

476
00:44:22,673 --> 00:44:25,836
And not all were from the
National Volunteer Force

477
00:44:26,911 --> 00:44:30,904
Are you aware of the fact that there
is Naxal backing within the security?

478
00:44:31,515 --> 00:44:32,675
Within the security?

479
00:44:33,150 --> 00:44:34,139
Yes Sir...

480
00:44:34,785 --> 00:44:36,412
And it is even more complicated...

481
00:44:37,555 --> 00:44:39,420
Normal criminal
psychology would say...

482
00:44:39,490 --> 00:44:41,219
The burglars would have
tried breaking...

483
00:44:41,292 --> 00:44:43,351
the glass under which
the medal was kept...

484
00:44:43,761 --> 00:44:45,285
The lock was broken.

485
00:44:45,796 --> 00:44:46,785
Exactly!

486
00:44:47,698 --> 00:44:49,359
And only a few insiders...

487
00:44:49,834 --> 00:44:52,735
knew that it was
unbreakable glass...

488
00:44:53,738 --> 00:44:56,832
Was there any attempt
to break the glass?

489
00:44:56,941 --> 00:44:57,930
No!

490
00:44:58,175 --> 00:44:59,301
Not at all...

491
00:44:59,610 --> 00:45:00,804
So they knew this...

492
00:45:01,278 --> 00:45:02,302
And even more...

493
00:45:03,114 --> 00:45:05,514
there is no evidence
of any one trying to...

494
00:45:05,716 --> 00:45:07,343
climb the top of the wired fence...

495
00:45:07,418 --> 00:45:08,680
to get into the campus

496
00:45:09,186 --> 00:45:10,210
How do you know that?

497
00:45:10,588 --> 00:45:14,581
There was no disturbance found on
the plants above the wired fence...

498
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:18,492
Some of them or
at least one of them...

499
00:45:19,263 --> 00:45:21,390
...must have been inside the
campus the night before

500
00:45:21,699 --> 00:45:23,860
So what was the point of entry?

501
00:45:24,502 --> 00:45:26,333
Through the window of course!

502
00:45:27,138 --> 00:45:31,905
Given the situation if
we start a blame game...

503
00:45:32,510 --> 00:45:34,102
It is not the need of the hour

504
00:45:34,812 --> 00:45:36,837
See... we need to
have utmost cooperation

505
00:45:36,914 --> 00:45:38,848
between the CBI and our office.

506
00:45:39,483 --> 00:45:42,247
Our job is to...
Sir, that lottery thing...

507
00:45:42,853 --> 00:45:44,411
The security files...

508
00:45:46,590 --> 00:45:48,455
Please give them
the security files...

509
00:45:48,859 --> 00:45:51,521
Please excuse me.
Bijay come outside once

510
00:45:56,767 --> 00:45:58,530
Who told you to act smart?

511
00:45:58,836 --> 00:46:01,634
No, you said that the Bolpur
lottery case... Yes... so?

512
00:46:02,073 --> 00:46:04,371
You told us to follow that clue

513
00:46:04,475 --> 00:46:06,340
We will follow up

514
00:46:06,777 --> 00:46:08,802
We don't have to share
everything with them...

515
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:12,377
then they will take the
credit in the media...

516
00:46:12,650 --> 00:46:16,211
try to understand Bijay.
It’s not that simple.

517
00:46:16,887 --> 00:46:20,118
If we can solve this case then
National or State award is assured.

518
00:46:20,391 --> 00:46:21,449
Sorry to disturb you...

519
00:46:21,659 --> 00:46:23,524
I have put the chicken
thief behind bars sir.

520
00:46:27,198 --> 00:46:28,358
Chief Minister?

521
00:46:28,532 --> 00:46:30,591
This letter... it's
very important sir.

522
00:46:30,868 --> 00:46:33,166
Here... give it to me.
I am the Chief Minister.

523
00:46:34,305 --> 00:46:36,466
What's your hesitation for?

524
00:46:36,807 --> 00:46:39,332
Doesn't he look like
the Chief Minister?

525
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:45,610
What's this?

526
00:46:48,252 --> 00:46:51,517
Begging with Tagore's photo?

527
00:46:56,594 --> 00:47:05,059
Within you lies the touchstone

528
00:47:05,436 --> 00:47:09,497
Do you not know my soul?

529
00:47:10,107 --> 00:47:13,873
Why seek it all your life?

530
00:47:15,613 --> 00:47:22,485
Painted faces, masks and mannequins

531
00:47:23,487 --> 00:47:29,153
Swarm the city streets

532
00:47:30,094 --> 00:47:37,557
Care of home and care of hearth

533
00:47:38,202 --> 00:47:46,541
Just festive shows splendid... Did
you not see or feel?

534
00:47:50,781 --> 00:47:53,113
O come on Bhanuda...

535
00:47:55,252 --> 00:47:58,153
I told you before.

536
00:48:02,259 --> 00:48:05,285
You tried...

537
00:48:10,601 --> 00:48:13,536
They didn't even
want to listen to you.

538
00:48:20,377 --> 00:48:22,607
Now this is Kolkata.

539
00:48:24,682 --> 00:48:26,650
And they hardly care
about our village...

540
00:48:29,186 --> 00:48:32,849
They will build
bungalows in our village

541
00:48:34,124 --> 00:48:37,685
and then go to our village
for fun to celebrate.

542
00:48:41,432 --> 00:48:42,831
A little bit of Tagore...

543
00:48:43,734 --> 00:48:45,702
a little bit of village
life... that's it.

544
00:48:46,437 --> 00:48:50,567
Really... your city is so amazing.

545
00:48:52,142 --> 00:48:55,839
Tell me one thing Bhanuda...

546
00:48:57,348 --> 00:48:59,373
they live such a lavish
life here in the city...

547
00:48:59,450 --> 00:49:01,418
and we are in that same rut.

548
00:49:03,787 --> 00:49:05,311
Don't you feel...

549
00:49:06,490 --> 00:49:12,861
don't you feel that you also
have a right to live like this...

550
00:49:14,531 --> 00:49:16,396
with your wife and son?

551
00:49:18,469 --> 00:49:23,634
We only live once Bhanuda...

552
00:49:26,210 --> 00:49:30,169
and you know pretty well
that this medal can change...

553
00:49:30,481 --> 00:49:34,713
No... no... that will
be wrong... Master...

554
00:49:34,785 --> 00:49:39,245
2See Bhanuda... I also
had righteousness before...

555
00:49:40,791 --> 00:49:47,492
but all these years of struggle in
Kolkata has left me bereft of all those.

556
00:49:52,369 --> 00:49:53,461
Listen...

557
00:49:55,539 --> 00:50:00,340
The lavish Kolkata you saw...

558
00:50:01,111 --> 00:50:03,909
do you know how much
black money is floating around?

559
00:50:08,686 --> 00:50:12,884
And... and moreover you
have found this medal...

560
00:50:13,123 --> 00:50:15,182
Believe me... it’s true...
I found it.

561
00:50:15,259 --> 00:50:17,625
So why do you need to be scared?

562
00:50:20,698 --> 00:50:25,328
...wait... let’s go then.

563
00:50:25,602 --> 00:50:26,591
Where?

564
00:50:29,306 --> 00:50:32,503
Yes, here you can tell me
what private thing you have to say...

565
00:50:32,843 --> 00:50:34,174
...it’s safe here.

566
00:50:35,346 --> 00:50:36,472
One small request.

567
00:50:37,314 --> 00:50:39,214
If you please stub
off your cigarette...

568
00:50:39,383 --> 00:50:40,509
there are gods here

569
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:48,653
You see, we intend to
sell an object to you...

570
00:50:50,194 --> 00:50:51,786
but nobody should
know about this...

571
00:50:53,430 --> 00:50:55,330
you will understand
after we tell you

572
00:50:55,866 --> 00:50:57,231
No problem at all.

573
00:50:57,434 --> 00:50:58,924
You will sell me the object
and I will give you the money.

574
00:50:59,169 --> 00:51:00,158
You leave...

575
00:51:00,404 --> 00:51:02,269
...you are also
happy I am also happy

576
00:51:02,539 --> 00:51:04,200
why should we tell this to anyone?

577
00:51:05,442 --> 00:51:06,807
You see Mr. Jhunjhunwallah...

578
00:51:07,478 --> 00:51:08,740
this is not any trivial object...

579
00:51:09,213 --> 00:51:10,305
Rabindranath Tagore's...

580
00:51:10,381 --> 00:51:12,872
Want to have tea? Spiced tea?

581
00:51:13,784 --> 00:51:15,183
No, no... we just had tea

582
00:51:15,319 --> 00:51:16,183
Sure?

583
00:51:16,253 --> 00:51:18,414
Shyamlal can bring it for you...

584
00:51:18,655 --> 00:51:19,314
no problem at all.

585
00:51:19,556 --> 00:51:20,784
Sure... sure... 100%.

586
00:51:21,892 --> 00:51:24,588
So yes, Rabindranath
Tagore's what?

587
00:51:25,696 --> 00:51:31,134
The Nobel that was
stolen is with us.

588
00:51:31,402 --> 00:51:33,393
But we didn't steal
it... we found it.

589
00:51:33,537 --> 00:51:39,533
I told you... whether
you have stolen it or not

590
00:51:39,777 --> 00:51:42,302
is none of my concern.

591
00:51:42,813 --> 00:51:45,373
What Jeet
am I correct?

592
00:51:45,516 --> 00:51:46,881
Right... absolutely right.

593
00:51:47,384 --> 00:51:51,650
Now if we give that
to you... how much?

594
00:51:52,689 --> 00:51:54,281
Is it made of gold?
Pure gold!

595
00:51:54,425 --> 00:51:56,586
From the British days... no
impurity at all. Solid gold.

596
00:51:56,827 --> 00:51:59,318
So gold is now per carat...

597
00:52:00,397 --> 00:52:02,365
What? Are you going to
pay according to the weight of gold?

598
00:52:02,533 --> 00:52:05,832
Then what? You just now
said its made of gold...

599
00:52:06,170 --> 00:52:09,333
Is this just gold?

600
00:52:09,406 --> 00:52:11,806
This is Tagore's Nobel medal...

601
00:52:12,176 --> 00:52:14,406
So what will I do with that?

602
00:52:14,745 --> 00:52:16,838
I have to melt it and get the
value for the gold isn't it?

603
00:52:17,481 --> 00:52:18,812
By the way, what
will you do with it?

604
00:52:19,249 --> 00:52:22,377
Mr. Jhunjhunwala do you know
you are insulting Bengalese?

605
00:52:23,487 --> 00:52:26,547
Strange
where did you see insult in this?

606
00:52:26,924 --> 00:52:28,186
If I am not sentimental
about this will...

607
00:52:28,258 --> 00:52:29,350
...I be sentimental about you?

608
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:32,923
Neither about me...

609
00:52:33,430 --> 00:52:34,920
...neither about yourself

610
00:52:35,766 --> 00:52:37,927
Sentiment is a bad thing...

611
00:52:38,569 --> 00:52:40,127
It spoils business.

612
00:52:41,238 --> 00:52:44,207
Okay... Tagore is
our National Poet,

613
00:52:44,274 --> 00:52:47,573
...so in that respect whatever
will be the price of the gold

614
00:52:47,911 --> 00:52:49,776
...I will pay you 20% more.

615
00:52:51,348 --> 00:52:52,508
20%?

616
00:52:54,384 --> 00:52:55,214
20%?

617
00:52:55,385 --> 00:52:57,717
Please don't bargain
anymore on that percentage.

618
00:52:58,188 --> 00:53:00,349
I can’t take any more risk.

619
00:53:01,391 --> 00:53:03,256
Stop it now...

620
00:53:03,794 --> 00:53:06,262
stop your constant ringing...

621
00:53:06,563 --> 00:53:09,123
Panditji... NOBELL...

622
00:53:09,833 --> 00:53:12,529
You see... this is
the age of celebrities.

623
00:53:13,203 --> 00:53:14,898
Celebrities are God now.

624
00:53:15,506 --> 00:53:17,633
My business model
is precisely there

625
00:53:18,308 --> 00:53:25,180
We have memorabilia
from famous people...

626
00:53:25,749 --> 00:53:26,738
Meaning?

627
00:53:26,850 --> 00:53:27,339
Meaning say...

628
00:53:27,718 --> 00:53:30,482
Meghnad Saha's eyeglasses
to Cheema Okerie's knee cap.

629
00:53:30,587 --> 00:53:31,576
Come on...

630
00:53:31,688 --> 00:53:34,248
...tell them our
collection from your laptop.

631
00:53:35,792 --> 00:53:36,781
Will I start?

632
00:53:36,894 --> 00:53:38,691
O yes, yes... confidently.

633
00:53:38,762 --> 00:53:40,696
Meghnad Saha's
eyeglasses, Bidhan Ray's pen,

634
00:53:40,764 --> 00:53:43,232
Satyajit Ray's pipe,
Uttam Kumar's slippers,

635
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:44,597
Sourav Ganguly's report card

636
00:53:44,835 --> 00:53:46,325
From Class Ten... he did quite well

637
00:53:46,904 --> 00:53:48,804
Cheema Okerie's hand cuff
Knee cap

638
00:53:49,373 --> 00:53:50,840
...it’s written wrongly here sir

639
00:53:51,241 --> 00:53:52,640
Mother Teresa's bangles...

640
00:53:52,776 --> 00:53:54,505
Did Mother Teresa wear bangles?

641
00:53:54,878 --> 00:53:57,574
Of course... she did not become
a nun right from birth isn't it?

642
00:53:58,615 --> 00:53:59,604
But you see...

643
00:53:59,850 --> 00:54:02,284
...older celebrities
don't have market value.

644
00:54:02,719 --> 00:54:04,482
Young generation wont lap it up

645
00:54:05,422 --> 00:54:06,548
How about Tagore?

646
00:54:07,691 --> 00:54:10,854
I can’t categorize that man you know

647
00:54:11,562 --> 00:54:14,122
You see, after 56 years there
is some centenary of his...

648
00:54:14,498 --> 00:54:16,489
...then his stock
price will rise...

649
00:54:16,767 --> 00:54:19,099
you know Bengalese are...
...a whimsical bunch.

650
00:54:19,403 --> 00:54:21,428
Then 5 years???

651
00:54:21,605 --> 00:54:23,835
Sir... bring stuff
from Gen X celebrities...

652
00:54:24,474 --> 00:54:26,635
...our Sourav Ganguly...

653
00:54:27,210 --> 00:54:28,541
Baichung Bhutia

654
00:54:30,714 --> 00:54:34,548
...our this... our that...

655
00:54:34,718 --> 00:54:36,709
and if you bring
something of guru'...

656
00:54:37,287 --> 00:54:39,380
Which guru'?

657
00:54:40,190 --> 00:54:45,287
His religion was mankind...

658
00:54:45,662 --> 00:54:50,156
Entire life he has worked
for the betterment of mankind.

659
00:54:50,801 --> 00:54:57,263
In any sphere of life he has
stood up against insult to humanity,

660
00:54:57,641 --> 00:54:59,199
...he has protested against them.

661
00:54:59,509 --> 00:55:04,105
Tagore has worked to
bring out amongst us...

662
00:55:04,314 --> 00:55:09,684
...the true qualities
which make a good human being

663
00:55:10,387 --> 00:55:12,446
Just think in that perspective

664
00:55:12,889 --> 00:55:18,088
Today, one of us Bengalese
have done this heinous crime

665
00:55:18,629 --> 00:55:19,755
Let’s go Bhanu da...

666
00:55:20,230 --> 00:55:21,788
By stealing his Nobel...

667
00:55:22,165 --> 00:55:23,325
they have not only
insulted him as a person...

668
00:55:23,867 --> 00:55:26,427
...but I would say, he has
insulted Tagore's philosophy

669
00:55:26,603 --> 00:55:29,231
We should be ashamed
of ourselves today...

670
00:55:29,873 --> 00:55:32,569
Friends... we should
question that...

671
00:55:32,743 --> 00:55:35,735
...whether we ourselves
are Nobel Thieves

672
00:55:37,914 --> 00:55:39,313
Let’s go Bhanu da.

673
00:55:40,150 --> 00:55:42,675
Today we have degraded
Rabindranath...

674
00:56:11,882 --> 00:56:15,511
Let’s not get into those small
time crooks anymore...

675
00:56:15,819 --> 00:56:19,152
I will take you to someone
now which is bound to give results

676
00:56:19,623 --> 00:56:20,612
Who?

677
00:56:21,124 --> 00:56:24,184
Why don't you let me teach
Bhanu Da this thing? See here...

678
00:56:24,327 --> 00:56:26,192
You told me that if
I press this button...

679
00:56:26,263 --> 00:56:27,628
...then the photo
will appear... then?

680
00:56:27,698 --> 00:56:29,791
Bhanu da listen here...

681
00:56:31,134 --> 00:56:34,433
He is the senior
manager of our hotel.

682
00:56:35,205 --> 00:56:37,366
Loves me a lot

683
00:56:37,841 --> 00:56:40,275
and he has great contacts.

684
00:56:40,877 --> 00:56:41,536
Here...

685
00:56:41,845 --> 00:56:43,779
Now try yourself... this one...

686
00:56:45,449 --> 00:56:47,144
What happened Bhanu da?

687
00:56:47,317 --> 00:56:48,341
You know...

688
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:53,521
...today in the street someone
was saying somethings about Tagore

689
00:56:54,825 --> 00:56:56,884
...said a lot of
things about this theft

690
00:56:58,428 --> 00:57:00,453
...I did not understand much but...

691
00:57:02,699 --> 00:57:06,157
Let’s go now Bhanuda. I will
be late for duty otherwise.

692
00:57:07,738 --> 00:57:09,399
Bhanu da, this way...

693
00:57:14,377 --> 00:57:15,742
Give your bag here...

694
00:57:16,279 --> 00:57:18,076
Why will I give my bag?

695
00:57:18,315 --> 00:57:21,079
Come on... it will
pass through the X-ray

696
00:57:21,284 --> 00:57:24,253
I have not stolen anything.
So why will you check me?

697
00:57:24,588 --> 00:57:27,284
We will give it back
to you... don't worry

698
00:57:27,724 --> 00:57:30,591
Bhanu da... give it, give it...
they will give it back to you here

699
00:57:33,130 --> 00:57:34,119
Shall I?

700
00:57:34,164 --> 00:57:36,223
This is the rule...

701
00:58:02,125 --> 00:58:06,858
What are you up to?

702
00:58:10,133 --> 00:58:12,624
Bhanu da... please sit here for a
while let me change my dress and come.

703
00:58:13,069 --> 00:58:14,661
Why? This looks fine on you...

704
00:58:14,805 --> 00:58:16,705
...will be back in a minute

705
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:18,831
So what will I do?

706
00:58:19,509 --> 00:58:21,534
Sit in that sofa...

707
00:58:59,382 --> 00:59:01,509
Let’s go.

708
00:59:02,052 --> 00:59:03,314
Looking good...

709
00:59:06,056 --> 00:59:07,318
What is happening there?

710
00:59:07,424 --> 00:59:10,825
That's the night club... want to go?
No no... just asking...

711
00:59:11,194 --> 00:59:12,525
Come... Come...

712
00:59:12,596 --> 00:59:15,064
I will take you
through the back door

713
00:59:16,166 --> 00:59:17,497
Watch your step...

714
00:59:19,369 --> 00:59:20,597
Be careful here

715
01:00:08,451 --> 01:00:11,284
Bhanu da how do you like it?

716
01:00:11,454 --> 01:00:12,113
What?

717
01:00:12,389 --> 01:00:14,118
I am saying how do you
like the place?

718
01:00:22,732 --> 01:00:25,599
Wow... what loud music...
by the way why are they dancing?

719
01:00:25,802 --> 01:00:27,599
What are you saying Bhanuda?
This is a place to dance...

720
01:00:28,238 --> 01:00:30,729
The rich kids all
come here to have fun.

721
01:00:31,274 --> 01:00:32,400
Fun for what?

722
01:00:33,376 --> 01:00:35,708
Even they don't know...
This side we will take the lift

723
01:00:41,785 --> 01:00:43,878
Strange ways of the rich... no?

724
01:01:03,139 --> 01:01:04,128
You wait here

725
01:01:05,275 --> 01:01:06,799
Let me tell him first

726
01:01:07,277 --> 01:01:08,676
and then I will call you in

727
01:01:13,783 --> 01:01:14,772
Come in!

728
01:01:20,757 --> 01:01:21,724
Good evening Sir!

729
01:01:21,791 --> 01:01:24,282
What's up? Have you come
to ask for overtime again?

730
01:01:24,427 --> 01:01:25,917
No, Sir... yes Sir...

731
01:01:26,296 --> 01:01:27,695
No sir or yes sir... which one?

732
01:01:27,831 --> 01:01:29,321
Meaning that's also there...

733
01:01:29,566 --> 01:01:31,466
...but I have come
for something else.

734
01:01:31,601 --> 01:01:33,159
Tell me quickly
I am on the phone.

735
01:01:45,882 --> 01:01:46,940
Disgusting!

736
01:01:48,852 --> 01:01:49,841
What?

737
01:01:51,588 --> 01:01:53,522
Nothing

738
01:01:53,957 --> 01:01:55,356
What do you mean?

739
01:01:55,825 --> 01:02:02,162
Hori... no no...
I have come with Jeet

740
01:02:06,836 --> 01:02:07,894
You mean the Noble prize?

741
01:02:08,204 --> 01:02:09,501
Yes Sir, I mean the Nobel prize

742
01:02:09,706 --> 01:02:10,764
...that is with Bhanuda

743
01:02:10,907 --> 01:02:12,306
I don't understand a thing.

744
01:02:12,475 --> 01:02:14,272
Have you come to joke
with me this late at night?

745
01:02:15,178 --> 01:02:16,167
Have you come drunk again?

746
01:02:16,379 --> 01:02:21,282
Not at all sir. Bhanuda
has found the Nobel medal

747
01:02:24,621 --> 01:02:26,521
Here see... there is a picture...

748
01:02:29,159 --> 01:02:30,148
Holy shit!

749
01:02:31,327 --> 01:02:34,694
One minute Sir, Bhanuda is here

750
01:02:37,834 --> 01:02:38,823
Bhanuda... come in

751
01:02:45,542 --> 01:02:46,702
Wow! What have you done?

752
01:02:46,810 --> 01:02:48,641
I have done nothing...

753
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:51,747
So what can I do?

754
01:02:52,449 --> 01:02:54,383
We want to sell this.

755
01:02:54,884 --> 01:02:58,251
Hori said since you know
so many top shot people...

756
01:02:58,955 --> 01:03:01,116
...you can definitely make
something of this... so...

757
01:03:01,891 --> 01:03:04,826
But where will you sell
such a thing? To whom?

758
01:03:05,395 --> 01:03:09,593
Everyone told us that
this has immense value?

759
01:03:10,834 --> 01:03:12,267
That's true...

760
01:03:13,169 --> 01:03:15,501
...but you know the police is
after this throughout the country.

761
01:03:16,206 --> 01:03:18,140
Do you even understand the
gravity of the situation?

762
01:03:19,275 --> 01:03:22,301
You just can’t go and sell
it in the market like that...

763
01:03:22,479 --> 01:03:24,470
and say we have
Tagore's Nobel prize

764
01:03:24,547 --> 01:03:25,775
...how much will you give
isn't it?

765
01:03:26,349 --> 01:03:30,183
Now, whether you can
sell this abroad or...

766
01:03:32,155 --> 01:03:34,282
Actually hold on...

767
01:03:39,295 --> 01:03:40,455
You are coming to the
club tomorrow... no?

768
01:03:40,830 --> 01:03:42,695
Tomorrow? Let’s see...

769
01:03:42,765 --> 01:03:43,754
Don't see...

770
01:03:43,833 --> 01:03:46,631
You have to come something...
What do you mean?

771
01:03:47,737 --> 01:03:49,136
Will tell when we meet

772
01:03:49,239 --> 01:03:50,570
Your Mexican business partner...

773
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:53,336
...the guy who came last year during
the Poush mela in Shantiniketan...

774
01:03:53,409 --> 01:03:55,172
Alejandro?

775
01:03:55,678 --> 01:03:59,170
Will call you at night
later... for the details

776
01:04:01,518 --> 01:04:04,487
Tomorrow at 8 in the morning
Tolly Club golf course...

777
01:04:08,825 --> 01:04:10,292
Alejandro is ecstatic

778
01:04:11,895 --> 01:04:14,796
You know... he himself
is a big Tagore fan

779
01:04:15,165 --> 01:04:17,292
You will find a guy
like him even in Bengalis

780
01:04:18,301 --> 01:04:20,428
On the other hand such
a business tycoon...

781
01:04:21,171 --> 01:04:22,297
Remarkable!

782
01:04:22,872 --> 01:04:25,272
Anyways, whatever
you do be careful.

783
01:04:25,475 --> 01:04:27,306
You are seeing how the
entire government machinery...

784
01:04:27,443 --> 01:04:28,603
...is after this medal

785
01:04:28,678 --> 01:04:29,667
O come on...

786
01:04:30,713 --> 01:04:32,203
It will die with in a week

787
01:04:39,856 --> 01:04:41,221
What the f!!!!

788
01:04:41,291 --> 01:04:43,316
Raj this is our guy

789
01:04:43,793 --> 01:04:45,385
Keep the ball there

790
01:04:45,628 --> 01:04:48,256
O my god...
Seems fresh of the boat!

791
01:04:50,867 --> 01:04:52,801
O... I thought... sorry

792
01:04:53,269 --> 01:04:54,258
Greetings...

793
01:04:54,437 --> 01:04:55,802
Jeet did not come?

794
01:04:56,372 --> 01:04:58,772
No Sir, he had night
duty yesterday...

795
01:04:59,275 --> 01:05:01,675
I only told him...
I can find my way

796
01:05:02,378 --> 01:05:03,470
First time in Kolkata?

797
01:05:04,280 --> 01:05:05,269
Yes.

798
01:05:05,848 --> 01:05:06,837
Let’s go

799
01:05:07,217 --> 01:05:09,276
You come back from your
trip... I am in no hurry.

800
01:05:09,352 --> 01:05:11,616
The game will go on...

801
01:05:12,322 --> 01:05:14,256
...let’s talk while in the cart

802
01:05:14,524 --> 01:05:16,583
Sit with him in the car

803
01:05:37,847 --> 01:05:39,747
Why don't you come
to my office then?

804
01:05:40,516 --> 01:05:41,505
This is my card.

805
01:05:41,818 --> 01:05:42,648
What?

806
01:05:42,719 --> 01:05:43,708
Card.

807
01:05:44,420 --> 01:05:45,717
Shall I keep this?

808
01:05:46,356 --> 01:05:48,290
His phone number and
everything is written there...

809
01:05:48,458 --> 01:05:50,392
Jeet will explain it to you.

810
01:05:51,194 --> 01:05:52,525
So when?

811
01:05:52,829 --> 01:05:53,761
Why don't you come tomorrow...

812
01:05:53,830 --> 01:05:55,354
Let’s finish off the job soon.

813
01:05:55,932 --> 01:05:57,422
See to it that he comes tomorrow

814
01:05:58,201 --> 01:06:01,693
And no one should know about this.

815
01:06:01,838 --> 01:06:03,567
Clear sir

816
01:06:04,374 --> 01:06:07,343
That will harm you more

817
01:06:14,117 --> 01:06:15,345
Maa... maa...

818
01:06:16,119 --> 01:06:18,178
Why are you shouting like that?

819
01:06:18,254 --> 01:06:19,653
There is police in our village.

820
01:06:20,757 --> 01:06:22,622
Police? Where?

821
01:06:22,859 --> 01:06:26,090
The police jeep turned
at the corner of Simultola

822
01:06:26,763 --> 01:06:27,855
You keep shut now

823
01:06:28,197 --> 01:06:29,357
Not a word from you...

824
01:06:29,832 --> 01:06:32,460
O God
why is police here?

825
01:06:49,385 --> 01:06:51,376
Look maa
there...

826
01:07:01,364 --> 01:07:04,231
O Lord... what did
you do this to us?

827
01:07:05,301 --> 01:07:07,292
Are they coming this way?

828
01:07:08,438 --> 01:07:11,498
Please save us Lord...

829
01:07:12,275 --> 01:07:14,175
Are they coming this way?
Yes, maa

830
01:07:14,344 --> 01:07:16,369
I told him so many times...

831
01:07:17,180 --> 01:07:19,444
What was the necessity
for this greed?

832
01:07:37,367 --> 01:07:41,201
Is this Bhanu Kumar
Hudati's house? Hey boy!

833
01:07:41,804 --> 01:07:44,272
If you don't say anything
you will be in bigger trouble

834
01:07:44,841 --> 01:07:46,900
No one has won a lottery from
here in the last one month...

835
01:07:48,111 --> 01:07:51,410
I have verified everywhere...

836
01:07:55,151 --> 01:07:57,176
Then which lottery did Bhanu win?

837
01:07:58,388 --> 01:08:00,117
I don't know anything...

838
01:08:01,124 --> 01:08:02,113
Honestly...

839
01:08:02,225 --> 01:08:04,193
Shall we take the
boy in lockup then?

840
01:08:04,761 --> 01:08:07,491
No no please... I beg you

841
01:08:08,765 --> 01:08:11,325
Do you know what
your husband has done?

842
01:08:12,468 --> 01:08:13,628
He will be hanged...

843
01:08:28,718 --> 01:08:30,208
Is the medal with your husband?

844
01:08:34,357 --> 01:08:35,847
Who else went to steal with him?

845
01:08:41,831 --> 01:08:46,268
No no... believe me he
got it outside our hut

846
01:08:48,171 --> 01:08:51,197
Don't fool me... come straight...

847
01:08:51,274 --> 01:08:52,263
No...

848
01:08:57,580 --> 01:08:59,275
Believe me he found it...

849
01:08:59,916 --> 01:09:03,613
Then he discussed with us and...

850
01:09:03,786 --> 01:09:04,775
You?

851
01:09:05,455 --> 01:09:07,650
I am the village school master.

852
01:09:09,292 --> 01:09:11,624
Believe me he did not steal it...

853
01:09:12,662 --> 01:09:15,426
He found it besides
the well behind his hut.

854
01:09:15,565 --> 01:09:18,056
Whether he stole it or
not that we will find out

855
01:09:19,101 --> 01:09:21,729
How could you guys
advice him into this?

856
01:09:23,539 --> 01:09:26,337
Do you know there is a big
smuggling racquet involved in this?

857
01:09:27,176 --> 01:09:28,609
Do you think they will leave him?

858
01:09:28,878 --> 01:09:31,506
But he has gone to return it...

859
01:09:33,249 --> 01:09:34,341
I wrote a...

860
01:09:34,417 --> 01:09:36,612
well if it was already
returned then I would not...

861
01:09:36,686 --> 01:09:38,085
...have come here

862
01:09:40,857 --> 01:09:43,485
Now give his current whereabouts

863
01:09:43,860 --> 01:09:45,327
I am giving you all...

864
01:09:46,162 --> 01:09:48,392
I brought it with me...

865
01:09:50,166 --> 01:09:52,760
but please see to it
that our Bhanu is safe

866
01:09:53,569 --> 01:09:54,831
Well! You guys screw it up...

867
01:09:55,571 --> 01:09:58,540
...and tell us to clean it.

868
01:09:59,742 --> 01:10:00,731
Let's go.

869
01:10:00,910 --> 01:10:02,377
One man had come.

870
01:10:05,915 --> 01:10:08,247
He held a pistol and asked
me where is your father'?

871
01:10:14,724 --> 01:10:15,713
Coming...

872
01:10:17,159 --> 01:10:18,922
Who is it?

873
01:10:23,666 --> 01:10:24,655
Who are you?

874
01:10:24,734 --> 01:10:25,723
Where is the thing?

875
01:10:26,202 --> 01:10:26,930
I don't know you...

876
01:10:27,169 --> 01:10:28,796
Keep shut. Not a single word...

877
01:10:29,639 --> 01:10:31,766
you guys go and check the rooms.

878
01:10:34,610 --> 01:10:36,271
Tell us quickly where
you have kept the thing?

879
01:10:40,917 --> 01:10:42,384
Will you tell or I
shall pull the trigger?

880
01:10:49,759 --> 01:10:51,727
Believe me I don't know.

881
01:10:53,729 --> 01:10:55,788
No boss. I didn't
find it anywhere...

882
01:10:55,965 --> 01:10:58,593
Found some jewellery... shall
we take them?

883
01:10:58,701 --> 01:11:01,169
No... it's just a
few thousand only...

884
01:11:01,504 --> 01:11:03,495
Listen. I am not touching anything.

885
01:11:03,673 --> 01:11:05,641
Just tell him not to
play games with us.

886
01:11:06,108 --> 01:11:09,271
And if by chance you inform
the police you see this?

887
01:11:09,812 --> 01:11:12,178
We will blow away
your entire family

888
01:11:20,356 --> 01:11:22,290
Arrest him tonight... without
any further delay

889
01:11:22,625 --> 01:11:24,252
Just take one armed personnel

890
01:11:28,364 --> 01:11:32,323
You are holding onto the
information for so long?

891
01:11:33,269 --> 01:11:39,572
Don't worry
sir... tonight itself...

892
01:11:39,642 --> 01:11:42,338
As it is we are accused
of calling him...

893
01:11:42,712 --> 01:11:45,875
...a bourgeoisie poet

894
01:11:46,482 --> 01:11:48,245
...you know the opposition will
make it into an election issue.

895
01:11:48,317 --> 01:11:49,784
Already the slogan is out that...

896
01:11:50,252 --> 01:11:52,345
...except the Nobel we have
apparently nothing to lose.

897
01:11:52,755 --> 01:11:56,191
I will report to you
tonight... don't worry.

898
01:12:03,566 --> 01:12:05,534
The election is
after two years and...

899
01:12:06,836 --> 01:12:07,825
...really.

900
01:12:11,507 --> 01:12:13,634
See... See what they have done

901
01:12:16,746 --> 01:12:17,770
What is all this?

902
01:12:20,249 --> 01:12:23,776
Bhanu da, please leave
our place at once...

903
01:12:24,587 --> 01:12:25,576
Leave now?

904
01:12:25,721 --> 01:12:26,813
Some thugs came today...

905
01:12:27,123 --> 01:12:28,147
...looking for you

906
01:12:28,224 --> 01:12:29,919
They threatened her with a gun

907
01:12:32,194 --> 01:12:33,491
Bhanuda... I am scared about you

908
01:12:33,729 --> 01:12:35,492
They said they will be back...

909
01:12:35,865 --> 01:12:37,856
You guys had to face
this because of me.

910
01:12:37,933 --> 01:12:39,491
We will be fine.

911
01:12:39,669 --> 01:12:40,863
They won’t benefit by harming us.

912
01:12:41,303 --> 01:12:43,430
You'll take care then.

913
01:12:44,907 --> 01:12:47,273
Where will you go
this late at night...

914
01:12:47,510 --> 01:12:49,205
Don't worry about me.

915
01:12:49,445 --> 01:12:50,434
I am leaving

916
01:12:50,613 --> 01:12:54,242
O... your phone.

917
01:13:41,263 --> 01:13:42,696
The bastard is stuck now

918
01:13:45,234 --> 01:13:46,895
Where will you go now?

919
01:13:55,377 --> 01:13:56,366
Give it to us you bastard...

920
01:13:58,280 --> 01:13:59,577
Why don't you shoot?

921
01:14:00,182 --> 01:14:01,513
...the medal is in the that bag.

922
01:14:01,584 --> 01:14:03,313
No, no... it’s not in the bag

923
01:14:03,486 --> 01:14:05,386
You shut up! Take
out what's in the bag

924
01:14:05,588 --> 01:14:06,555
Shoot I say

925
01:14:06,622 --> 01:14:07,611
Take it out

926
01:14:10,426 --> 01:14:11,825
Take the medal out

927
01:14:13,429 --> 01:14:15,329
Bring that down... bring
that down I say...

928
01:14:17,299 --> 01:14:18,527
What happened? Shoot...

929
01:14:18,834 --> 01:14:20,699
Its Tagore...
how can I shoot at him

930
01:14:23,372 --> 01:14:26,341
Yes, shoot... if you
have the guts shoot now...

931
01:14:26,442 --> 01:14:28,171
Take it down you bastard...
otherwise I will...

932
01:14:28,711 --> 01:14:30,338
Fuck man... give
the pistol to me...

933
01:14:52,635 --> 01:14:53,761
Let’s see that side

934
01:15:30,539 --> 01:15:31,631
You bought another car?

935
01:15:31,707 --> 01:15:34,107
Not for me. It’s her birthday gift

936
01:15:34,376 --> 01:15:37,436
It's not my birthday gift...
It’s he who wanted the car

937
01:15:37,813 --> 01:15:40,680
Babu... I am in deep trouble.

938
01:15:41,650 --> 01:15:42,617
Who is this?

939
01:15:42,685 --> 01:15:45,677
I am Bhanu...
Today morning we met...

940
01:15:51,527 --> 01:15:53,290
You are calling this late?

941
01:15:54,730 --> 01:15:56,595
I told you to come tomorrow
in the office "no"?

942
01:15:56,899 --> 01:15:57,888
Who?

943
01:15:58,467 --> 01:16:01,732
Babu, some people are
trying to kill me...

944
01:16:02,238 --> 01:16:04,638
I am running away from them babu.

945
01:16:04,740 --> 01:16:06,731
So why don't you call the police
then... o, actually don't.

946
01:16:09,178 --> 01:16:12,579
Babu, in this big city I
don't know anyone except you.

947
01:16:12,815 --> 01:16:14,510
You were with your friend "no"?

948
01:16:14,650 --> 01:16:17,244
Yes, they had come to his place.

949
01:16:17,586 --> 01:16:19,349
You see Bhanu, this
late at night...

950
01:16:19,755 --> 01:16:24,249
Please save my life
babu... I am begging you

951
01:16:24,693 --> 01:16:26,490
Okay... remember
the card I gave you?

952
01:16:27,363 --> 01:16:29,126
My address is in that.

953
01:16:29,698 --> 01:16:30,790
Can you find my place?

954
01:16:31,133 --> 01:16:32,464
I can surely...

955
01:16:34,470 --> 01:16:36,597
I can’t thank you enough

956
01:16:43,312 --> 01:16:44,711
Doesn't she look like Aparna Sen?

957
01:16:46,882 --> 01:16:47,814
Yak... she does actually!

958
01:16:47,883 --> 01:16:48,872
Really?

959
01:16:51,887 --> 01:16:54,549
Diya, listen once.

960
01:16:57,559 --> 01:16:58,548
Any problem Raj?

961
01:16:58,727 --> 01:16:59,921
No, no... nothing as such.

962
01:17:00,195 --> 01:17:02,527
Why are you taking away your wife?

963
01:17:02,765 --> 01:17:04,164
Because you are flirting with her

964
01:17:07,836 --> 01:17:10,066
What? He is coming here?

965
01:17:10,773 --> 01:17:13,241
Tell me what else I could
do... he was begging

966
01:17:13,309 --> 01:17:14,333
What else meaning?

967
01:17:15,444 --> 01:17:16,433
You are bringing home
a stranger at night...

968
01:17:16,779 --> 01:17:18,144
...and we also have guests now

969
01:17:19,682 --> 01:17:21,240
He is being chased
by a group of thugs

970
01:17:21,383 --> 01:17:24,546
Exactly! It is precisely because of
that you shouldn't have brought him home

971
01:17:25,587 --> 01:17:26,679
Now if we land in trouble?

972
01:17:27,289 --> 01:17:28,278
Who will be responsible?

973
01:17:28,524 --> 01:17:29,513
But...

974
01:17:30,259 --> 01:17:32,090
Can’t we do even this
much for a poor guy?

975
01:17:32,695 --> 01:17:34,788
He is a poor villager stuck
in Kolkata at night...

976
01:17:35,097 --> 01:17:36,428
He is in a helpless state Diya...

977
01:17:42,838 --> 01:17:44,669
Listen Raj. Don't try
to be a good Samaritan

978
01:17:45,541 --> 01:17:46,735
I know why you are
so concerned about him

979
01:17:46,842 --> 01:17:48,673
Why? Tell me what you think?

980
01:17:49,778 --> 01:17:51,109
He is a cash cow for you

981
01:17:52,214 --> 01:17:53,203
Diya this is too much

982
01:17:53,282 --> 01:17:54,442
This is too much for me also

983
01:17:55,484 --> 01:17:56,746
Do whatever you like.

984
01:17:57,186 --> 01:17:58,448
Don't drag me into this

985
01:18:18,107 --> 01:18:19,335
You guys are also leaving?

986
01:18:19,475 --> 01:18:21,670
Ya... Raj asked me not
to flirt with you anymore

987
01:18:23,412 --> 01:18:24,504
lts not fair

988
01:18:24,580 --> 01:18:25,842
I know and...

989
01:18:33,655 --> 01:18:34,644
Come

990
01:18:36,425 --> 01:18:37,414
Come

991
01:18:49,271 --> 01:18:50,363
When did he leave?

992
01:18:50,539 --> 01:18:57,308
Few hours back... just see
what they did to our house.

993
01:18:57,479 --> 01:18:59,674
You'll have no
idea where he went?

994
01:18:59,848 --> 01:19:01,509
Any mobile number?

995
01:19:01,583 --> 01:19:06,714
No... he had my wife's phone
gave it back before leaving

996
01:19:07,823 --> 01:19:09,586
Where is the Nobel?
Tell us honestly.

997
01:19:10,092 --> 01:19:14,222
Believe me apart from him
nobody knows where he kept it

998
01:19:14,430 --> 01:19:16,227
I am swearing by God!

999
01:19:17,399 --> 01:19:20,163
Arrest him... and
seize his mobile...

1000
01:19:20,502 --> 01:19:22,129
Where are you taking him?

1001
01:19:22,571 --> 01:19:23,629
Just keep shut.

1002
01:19:24,106 --> 01:19:25,698
Let us do our duty.

1003
01:19:31,113 --> 01:19:32,375
Where did he sleep?

1004
01:19:36,285 --> 01:19:38,549
Ratul will sleep with us today.

1005
01:19:39,721 --> 01:19:41,188
And please lock the door

1006
01:19:41,523 --> 01:19:42,683
He is a nice guy Diya

1007
01:19:43,258 --> 01:19:44,247
Harmless

1008
01:19:45,227 --> 01:19:46,216
May be...

1009
01:19:47,262 --> 01:19:49,093
But I am not going
to take chances though

1010
01:19:50,599 --> 01:19:53,693
You can leave the software
business and start smuggling

1011
01:19:56,405 --> 01:19:58,100
Where did you see smuggling here?

1012
01:19:58,607 --> 01:19:59,596
What else?

1013
01:20:01,376 --> 01:20:02,673
Export-import... that's it

1014
01:20:03,212 --> 01:20:04,804
It's just exporting a good abroad

1015
01:20:05,147 --> 01:20:07,172
This thing has no market
within the country... rather

1016
01:20:12,354 --> 01:20:14,254
Yes... you left your phone here

1017
01:20:15,157 --> 01:20:16,681
I will send it to you tomorrow

1018
01:20:21,563 --> 01:20:22,894
Please don't forget Raj

1019
01:20:23,732 --> 01:20:28,863
What you are calling as good'
it is Tagore's Nobel medal.

1020
01:20:29,238 --> 01:20:30,500
So what?

1021
01:20:32,374 --> 01:20:33,807
So what?

1022
01:20:35,344 --> 01:20:36,675
It's a national heritage!

1023
01:20:37,179 --> 01:20:37,907
It's sacred

1024
01:20:38,147 --> 01:20:41,344
Now come on... typical Bengalese.

1025
01:20:42,351 --> 01:20:43,841
Neither could they market Tagore,

1026
01:20:44,219 --> 01:20:45,516
...they did not understand his USP

1027
01:20:46,221 --> 01:20:47,813
...they are just good at
celebrating his Birthday,

1028
01:20:48,190 --> 01:20:49,179
Death Anniversary etc.

1029
01:20:49,258 --> 01:20:50,748
Bengali middle class hypocrisy

1030
01:20:51,226 --> 01:20:52,693
That's why Bengalis
could not progress

1031
01:20:59,201 --> 01:21:00,168
You are drunk

1032
01:21:01,103 --> 01:21:03,503
If I don't take it then
someone else will just lap it up.

1033
01:21:04,273 --> 01:21:06,264
At least that someone
is not my husband

1034
01:21:08,443 --> 01:21:09,535
What will your son learn from you?

1035
01:21:10,879 --> 01:21:12,369
It was better if I did
not tell you about this

1036
01:21:12,881 --> 01:21:14,109
Sure.

1037
01:21:14,716 --> 01:21:16,115
At least I wouldn't
have known that...

1038
01:21:16,185 --> 01:21:17,675
...such a heinous thing act is
happening in front of my own eyes

1039
01:21:19,421 --> 01:21:21,548
And you are exploiting
a simple man for that.

1040
01:21:21,690 --> 01:21:23,123
Give me a break Diya

1041
01:21:23,559 --> 01:21:24,583
simple my foot.

1042
01:21:25,394 --> 01:21:26,759
Found it outside my hut

1043
01:21:27,362 --> 01:21:28,590
...all rubbish.

1044
01:21:29,331 --> 01:21:30,730
As if I don't
understand anything.

1045
01:21:31,300 --> 01:21:32,699
He is a very shrewd guy...

1046
01:21:33,335 --> 01:21:34,802
just behaves like a simpleton.

1047
01:21:36,638 --> 01:21:37,900
I know these guys very well.

1048
01:21:51,186 --> 01:21:53,177
What did I land myself into?

1049
01:22:04,233 --> 01:22:07,293
This Nobel thing of yours...
I still don't know what it is...

1050
01:22:08,704 --> 01:22:10,399
but what all is going on with this.

1051
01:22:13,208 --> 01:22:16,837
Who are you?

1052
01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:22,543
Everyone from a poor
farmer like me to the rich

1053
01:22:22,618 --> 01:22:24,518
...all are running after it.

1054
01:22:27,889 --> 01:22:30,255
Some say they will sell
you for the worth of gold,

1055
01:22:31,593 --> 01:22:33,561
some wants to sell you abroad...

1056
01:22:37,266 --> 01:22:40,167
I have understood everything now.

1057
01:22:42,404 --> 01:22:44,167
I don't like it...

1058
01:22:45,274 --> 01:22:46,741
I don't like it anymore

1059
01:22:49,211 --> 01:22:53,147
Please forgive me...

1060
01:22:54,683 --> 01:22:56,173
I did not understand your worth.

1061
01:22:57,953 --> 01:23:03,653
In the lure of my cycle and
my roof I did not realize...

1062
01:23:06,361 --> 01:23:07,760
Please forgive me...

1063
01:23:22,377 --> 01:23:25,278
Master, how did you support
Bhanu in this venture?

1064
01:23:25,347 --> 01:23:27,907
I would say even he
is a part of this plan.

1065
01:23:28,550 --> 01:23:29,778
He will have a share also.

1066
01:23:30,452 --> 01:23:33,387
Believe me... Bhanu
did not steal it.

1067
01:23:33,622 --> 01:23:36,147
The entire world now
knows he is the Nobel Thief

1068
01:23:36,658 --> 01:23:38,182
...and we will believe your word?

1069
01:23:38,260 --> 01:23:39,352
Burn his house for now.

1070
01:23:39,594 --> 01:23:40,822
This is an insult to Tagore.

1071
01:23:41,196 --> 01:23:43,255
An insult to God. How dare he?

1072
01:23:43,332 --> 01:23:46,563
I am pleading you...

1073
01:23:46,935 --> 01:23:53,397
If by tomorrow Bhanu
does not return it...

1074
01:23:53,875 --> 01:23:57,311
...then we all will burn his hut

1075
01:23:57,846 --> 01:24:02,146
We cannot tolerate this
from the village. Got it.

1076
01:24:02,217 --> 01:24:05,414
Agree?
Yes yes yes...

1077
01:24:07,222 --> 01:24:09,690
Your father is the Nobel Thief...

1078
01:24:10,092 --> 01:24:12,151
Your father is the Nobel Thief...

1079
01:24:36,418 --> 01:24:37,407
Ratul

1080
01:24:39,421 --> 01:24:40,888
You have school...

1081
01:24:47,195 --> 01:24:48,184
Ratul...

1082
01:24:57,539 --> 01:24:59,336
Yahoo. Com, Yahoo...

1083
01:25:00,275 --> 01:25:01,537
What are you saying kid?

1084
01:25:02,411 --> 01:25:03,776
You are so stupid.

1085
01:25:04,446 --> 01:25:05,845
We don't have those
in our village...

1086
01:25:06,548 --> 01:25:07,674
Will you come to our village?

1087
01:25:07,783 --> 01:25:09,080
Where?

1088
01:25:10,419 --> 01:25:14,150
Fields, ponds, cows
so many things are there

1089
01:25:14,589 --> 01:25:16,284
...you don't have
it in your city here.

1090
01:25:18,593 --> 01:25:19,685
Greetings Madam

1091
01:25:20,729 --> 01:25:23,163
...yesterday I
could not talk to you

1092
01:25:23,265 --> 01:25:24,630
Did you sleep properly?

1093
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:25,789
Yes, yes.

1094
01:25:25,867 --> 01:25:28,165
Have never slept
in such a bed before

1095
01:25:28,303 --> 01:25:30,203
I thought I can’t sleep here...

1096
01:25:32,107 --> 01:25:33,699
Ratul go.
You have school...

1097
01:25:34,443 --> 01:25:37,378
I will open an email account for
you after I come back from school

1098
01:25:44,352 --> 01:25:45,819
You have family in your village?

1099
01:25:46,221 --> 01:25:48,553
My wife and my son...

1100
01:25:49,191 --> 01:25:50,522
He is as old as your son.

1101
01:25:51,126 --> 01:25:53,424
Very naughty. I do
send him to school.

1102
01:25:54,529 --> 01:25:55,518
Good!

1103
01:25:56,264 --> 01:25:58,425
Otherwise he will be an
illiterate farmer like me

1104
01:26:00,602 --> 01:26:02,229
I have not spoken to them
for three days now...

1105
01:26:04,639 --> 01:26:06,834
Do you want to speak to
them? Do you have any number?

1106
01:26:07,142 --> 01:26:11,169
Yes, yes...
that corner shop... Proshad

1107
01:26:11,379 --> 01:26:13,176
I have his mobile number with me.

1108
01:26:14,316 --> 01:26:16,511
Give the number I
will dial it for you.

1109
01:26:41,810 --> 01:26:44,335
Hello... hello...
Proshad? This is Bhanu here...

1110
01:26:44,446 --> 01:26:47,108
Will I give it to your wife?
Yes please...

1111
01:26:47,749 --> 01:26:49,182
Bhanuda's phone...

1112
01:26:49,484 --> 01:26:52,419
Bhanuda's phone...

1113
01:26:57,759 --> 01:26:59,454
Are you all right?

1114
01:27:00,395 --> 01:27:03,091
How are you?

1115
01:27:03,398 --> 01:27:06,162
Is our son going to school?

1116
01:27:06,234 --> 01:27:07,633
Police had come to our house...

1117
01:27:09,371 --> 01:27:10,804
Police? What are you saying?

1118
01:27:12,507 --> 01:27:14,372
...it seems we can’t live
in the village anymore

1119
01:27:15,377 --> 01:27:17,072
...everyone is cursing us

1120
01:27:17,445 --> 01:27:20,312
They had gone to Master's house
also and hurled abuses at him

1121
01:27:22,284 --> 01:27:24,115
You don't know?

1122
01:27:25,887 --> 01:27:29,414
Everyone is saying that police
is looking for you in Kolkata

1123
01:27:30,158 --> 01:27:31,819
...apparently they
showed on TV too.

1124
01:27:32,627 --> 01:27:34,857
Everyone is saying that
you are the Nobel Thief

1125
01:27:35,664 --> 01:27:38,895
Listen... will you
do something for me?

1126
01:27:40,535 --> 01:27:41,866
What? Tell quickly...

1127
01:27:43,171 --> 01:27:45,696
Please come back to our village.

1128
01:27:46,808 --> 01:27:48,537
We don't want the money.

1129
01:27:49,411 --> 01:27:50,605
We were fine as it is

1130
01:27:52,180 --> 01:27:53,545
We are losing everything now

1131
01:27:55,784 --> 01:27:57,217
When did the police come?

1132
01:27:58,186 --> 01:28:01,587
Please dear
our son's future will be cursed

1133
01:28:02,290 --> 01:28:04,087
We don't want the money...

1134
01:28:05,226 --> 01:28:07,786
Promise me that you will

1135
01:28:08,730 --> 01:28:11,290
Don't worry, I am coming soon.

1136
01:28:25,246 --> 01:28:26,406
Bhanu... let’s go.

1137
01:28:26,581 --> 01:28:28,276
You remember the place no?

1138
01:28:32,220 --> 01:28:33,209
Sir...

1139
01:28:33,421 --> 01:28:34,410
What?

1140
01:28:36,591 --> 01:28:38,183
Sir
I can’t do this.

1141
01:28:40,562 --> 01:28:41,551
What?

1142
01:28:43,365 --> 01:28:44,559
I can’t do this.

1143
01:28:45,634 --> 01:28:48,194
I decided yesterday night itself.

1144
01:28:49,170 --> 01:28:50,159
What are you saying Bhanu

1145
01:28:51,773 --> 01:28:53,297
Everything has been arranged.

1146
01:28:53,441 --> 01:28:54,703
You will get the money...

1147
01:28:55,577 --> 01:28:56,703
How can you do this now?

1148
01:28:57,512 --> 01:28:58,774
I don't want the money

1149
01:29:00,215 --> 01:29:01,204
I have suffered enough.

1150
01:29:02,050 --> 01:29:04,484
My wife also told me
we are happy as we are

1151
01:29:05,654 --> 01:29:07,849
They are now against
us in the village too.

1152
01:29:08,456 --> 01:29:09,753
They are cursing me...

1153
01:29:11,326 --> 01:29:12,315
We were doing fine

1154
01:29:13,061 --> 01:29:14,619
By wanting to sell Tagore...

1155
01:29:15,163 --> 01:29:16,653
I am losing everything in life

1156
01:29:17,866 --> 01:29:20,562
What will I teach my own son?

1157
01:29:21,703 --> 01:29:22,397
Please...

1158
01:29:22,470 --> 01:29:25,871
You know you will
get 5 lakhs for this?

1159
01:29:27,175 --> 01:29:28,802
I have got its value.

1160
01:29:30,178 --> 01:29:31,873
None of us can keep this.

1161
01:29:33,448 --> 01:29:35,279
In the village they told me that...

1162
01:29:35,684 --> 01:29:38,175
...in Kolkata one
will get its value

1163
01:29:39,354 --> 01:29:42,221
...here you are saying that
abroad one will get its true value

1164
01:29:43,692 --> 01:29:47,788
But this illiterate farmer
has understood its value

1165
01:29:51,366 --> 01:29:53,300
This is not something to be sold

1166
01:29:54,169 --> 01:29:55,363
it is something we
should keep in our hearts.

1167
01:29:55,503 --> 01:29:56,492
O... Shut up!

1168
01:29:58,406 --> 01:29:59,532
What the hell?

1169
01:29:59,841 --> 01:30:02,708
Do as you have decided.

1170
01:30:03,545 --> 01:30:04,534
You will be at peace.

1171
01:30:04,612 --> 01:30:06,546
Now will you stop insulting
me in front of this...

1172
01:30:09,484 --> 01:30:11,918
Do you think I will
let you go so easily?

1173
01:30:12,353 --> 01:30:13,752
...do you know what
I can do to you?

1174
01:30:14,656 --> 01:30:15,645
I know Sir...

1175
01:30:17,258 --> 01:30:18,725
...just yesterday I
was in front of a gun

1176
01:30:20,395 --> 01:30:21,760
After all Rabi
Tagore saved my life.

1177
01:30:23,598 --> 01:30:25,122
Now I am not afraid anymore

1178
01:30:26,167 --> 01:30:27,600
You can do whatever you like

1179
01:30:30,572 --> 01:30:33,132
but as long as I am alive
I will not let this happen.

1180
01:30:34,442 --> 01:30:37,468
I will go and keep it
in Tagore's house myself

1181
01:30:38,847 --> 01:30:40,280
This belongs there

1182
01:30:40,682 --> 01:30:41,944
Let it be there

1183
01:30:44,519 --> 01:30:48,148
Now I feel very happy, you know...

1184
01:30:50,258 --> 01:30:51,247
You...

1185
01:31:01,336 --> 01:31:02,769
Take care of yourself

1186
01:31:10,845 --> 01:31:12,710
Hello! Police station?

1187
01:31:13,281 --> 01:31:16,580
...listen I had locked
the Nobel thief in my house

1188
01:31:16,718 --> 01:31:18,845
I think he just escaped...

1189
01:31:21,122 --> 01:31:22,749
27 Southern Avenue...

1190
01:31:30,932 --> 01:31:34,299
Control! Control! He has
taken the Keyatala road

1191
01:31:39,674 --> 01:31:41,437
Hon'ble Chief Minister,

1192
01:31:43,144 --> 01:31:47,911
I have come to give you...

1193
01:31:49,484 --> 01:31:52,681
...the Nobel Medal of Tagore

1194
01:31:53,655 --> 01:31:57,352
This medal...

1195
01:31:59,761 --> 01:32:01,626
Immediately inform
the field officers

1196
01:32:02,297 --> 01:32:03,423
Change the operation agenda

1197
01:32:03,498 --> 01:32:06,296
No... No... No... under no
circumstances shall you shoot

1198
01:32:06,534 --> 01:32:08,764
Sir they can’t be contacted

1199
01:32:09,370 --> 01:32:11,270
Do whatever immediately...

1200
01:32:40,535 --> 01:32:41,934
Stop there right now...

1201
01:32:44,439 --> 01:32:46,168
If you move we will shoot

1202
01:33:00,421 --> 01:33:01,854
Sir he is escaping...

1203
01:33:02,123 --> 01:33:03,112
Shoot him...

1204
01:33:05,126 --> 01:33:06,218
Shoot him in the legs

1205
01:33:46,401 --> 01:33:48,733
Told you to shoot in the legs
