1
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,131
'This is my story.'

2
00:02:26,435 --> 00:02:29,404
'That story which was never told.'

3
00:02:30,206 --> 00:02:33,573
'And never heard. But was only witnessed.'

4
00:02:34,277 --> 00:02:36,905
'And the eyes which witnessed it slowly...

5
00:02:37,013 --> 00:02:39,573
...vanished into the darkness of history.'

6
00:02:40,683 --> 00:02:44,380
'It is said that history was never written properly.'

7
00:02:45,087 --> 00:02:47,055
'That is why the names of those...

8
00:02:47,156 --> 00:02:50,057
...who helped make history do not find mention.'

9
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,928
'Maybe in the same way my mention...

10
00:02:53,029 --> 00:02:56,123
...in my own story may not be written.'

11
00:02:57,166 --> 00:03:00,932
'In 1971, a war was fought between India and Pakistan...

12
00:03:01,037 --> 00:03:05,974
...which was named as the Bangladesh war.'

13
00:03:06,542 --> 00:03:08,976
'Pakistan could not rise after that defeat.'

14
00:03:09,679 --> 00:03:12,045
'Even we could not forget that war.'

15
00:03:12,949 --> 00:03:16,908
'Because we had also fought gallantly...

16
00:03:17,019 --> 00:03:20,921
...with the Indian forces.'

17
00:03:36,939 --> 00:03:41,239
Parade, will turn around! Turn around!

18
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:55,523
Parade, will move forward! Turn around!

19
00:03:59,228 --> 00:04:00,422
When did this happen?

20
00:04:00,696 --> 00:04:04,427
3 days back, sir. The tunnel was dug from barrack No. 3.

21
00:04:06,035 --> 00:04:07,400
There is no one there.

22
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:09,904
We were thinking of shifting some prisoners there.

23
00:04:10,006 --> 00:04:12,907
How did this attempt evade your gaze?

24
00:04:14,143 --> 00:04:17,044
It is been only 3 months since they have come here.

25
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:20,313
They are not even in a position to walk properly.

26
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:24,044
It is a very big task to dig a tunnel 19 feet long.

27
00:04:26,956 --> 00:04:28,514
Who is this Suraj Singh?

28
00:04:28,624 --> 00:04:31,320
Major Suraj Singh, 19 Rajputana rifle.

29
00:04:32,228 --> 00:04:35,994
He was apprehended in Puri sector on 12th December 1971.

30
00:04:36,432 --> 00:04:38,093
Due to devoid of ammunition.

31
00:04:38,968 --> 00:04:41,061
Before that he was in Lahore.

32
00:04:42,171 --> 00:04:45,299
It is heard that he has undergone punishment twice for escaping.

33
00:04:45,408 --> 00:04:47,239
Parade attention!

34
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:55,645
Good morning sir!
- Good morning sir!

35
00:04:55,751 --> 00:04:59,312
Good morning! Carry on.

36
00:05:18,674 --> 00:05:24,044
Welcome major. How did you spend your night, major?

37
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:33,045
Not bad. I was with my own men.

38
00:05:34,557 --> 00:05:36,923
Seeing the condition of your men you must have understood...

39
00:05:37,026 --> 00:05:39,995
...that such an attempt is futile.

40
00:05:41,697 --> 00:05:44,257
He is deputy director, Colonel Sheriar Khan.

41
00:05:44,967 --> 00:05:46,662
Joint Intelligence Bureau.

42
00:05:56,078 --> 00:05:58,911
Ameeting should be arranged so that...

43
00:05:59,015 --> 00:06:01,984
...I can meet a Pakistani National.

44
00:06:03,085 --> 00:06:05,178
You have not answered my question.

45
00:06:07,289 --> 00:06:11,419
And should be provided with a newspaper, daily.

46
00:06:12,561 --> 00:06:14,927
And be given an explanation as to what is the...

47
00:06:15,031 --> 00:06:16,931
...Pakistani government thinking...

48
00:06:17,033 --> 00:06:19,263
...as regards to sending us back to India.

49
00:06:19,368 --> 00:06:24,396
Or else... you will keep attempting to escape from here.

50
00:06:25,608 --> 00:06:27,235
Who else was there with you?

51
00:06:31,547 --> 00:06:40,114
I and... only me.

52
00:06:41,557 --> 00:06:48,520
Ok! Barrack No.6! Come!

53
00:06:55,938 --> 00:07:00,238
And Major... you should be thankful to our government...

54
00:07:00,342 --> 00:07:04,506
...that even after being caught, you are alive.

55
00:07:06,949 --> 00:07:10,908
You should be thankful to our government...

56
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:14,922
...that after the war ended they handed over...

57
00:07:15,024 --> 00:07:19,051
...93,000 Pakistani soldiers intact, back to Pakistan.

58
00:07:21,697 --> 00:07:25,929
I am seeing the generosity of your government...

59
00:07:26,035 --> 00:07:28,526
...since the past 3 days...

60
00:07:30,206 --> 00:07:32,037
...in barrack No. 6.

61
00:07:42,685 --> 00:07:45,245
This is Pakistan. This is Karachi.

62
00:07:45,688 --> 00:07:48,054
This is Lahore. This is Faisalabad...

63
00:07:48,157 --> 00:07:49,590
...and this is Peshawar.

64
00:07:49,692 --> 00:07:52,320
How are you Pali?
- I am fine, sir.

65
00:07:53,963 --> 00:07:56,090
Why don't they reveal where we are?

66
00:07:58,033 --> 00:08:02,902
We can say observing this mountain range, Kabir...

67
00:08:03,005 --> 00:08:06,964
...that we cannot be in the west of Pakistan.

68
00:08:07,676 --> 00:08:09,405
And they cannot do a folly to keep us in an area...

69
00:08:09,512 --> 00:08:11,412
...close to the border, sir.

70
00:08:11,514 --> 00:08:13,038
But how did this happen so suddenly?

71
00:08:13,549 --> 00:08:14,914
Indian soldiers from every Pakistan jail...

72
00:08:15,017 --> 00:08:16,450
...have been held captive here.

73
00:08:17,019 --> 00:08:18,316
Facilities have been increased.

74
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:19,978
The jail has been extended.

75
00:08:20,489 --> 00:08:22,047
How did this change happen so suddenly?

76
00:08:26,962 --> 00:08:28,987
All of them are from 1971 war in this barrack?

77
00:08:29,965 --> 00:08:31,432
Some are also from 1965 war, sir.

78
00:08:32,101 --> 00:08:33,659
But they are of no use.

79
00:08:34,503 --> 00:08:40,032
Everyone has gone crazy. They shout slogans for India.

80
00:08:40,543 --> 00:08:43,910
Unknown that they are dead for India.

81
00:08:44,013 --> 00:08:46,038
Didn't you try to send them back?

82
00:08:46,415 --> 00:08:47,905
Are they of any use here?

83
00:08:48,017 --> 00:08:50,577
Sir, let alone their address.

84
00:08:50,686 --> 00:08:52,313
They do not even know their names.

85
00:08:53,355 --> 00:08:56,051
But sir, you are wrong in saying that they are of no use.

86
00:08:56,492 --> 00:08:57,516
What do you mean?

87
00:08:57,693 --> 00:08:59,991
Everyone is put to work.

88
00:09:00,963 --> 00:09:03,989
Tomorrow is EID. It's a good day. Leave Major Suraj Singh.

89
00:09:22,952 --> 00:09:28,515
Hey... listen.
- What is it?
- Hey listen.

90
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:34,658
Do Punjabis reside here in Pakistan?
- Yes. They reside here.

91
00:09:34,964 --> 00:09:38,991
And the Sindhis.
- Yes! They also reside here.

92
00:09:39,568 --> 00:09:42,366
Listen. These Muslim brethren are here.

93
00:09:42,471 --> 00:09:44,405
Yes. Then what happened.

94
00:09:45,274 --> 00:09:48,903
I was thinking they reside in India too!

95
00:09:49,011 --> 00:09:51,980
So what if they reside here!
- Then why was Pakistan made?

96
00:09:52,081 --> 00:09:53,981
It was a mistake! We will not make this mistake henceforth!

97
00:09:55,951 --> 00:10:02,447
Will you please shut up? Both of you!
- Sorry sir. Say sorry.

98
00:10:02,558 --> 00:10:03,991
Sorry sir.

99
00:10:25,614 --> 00:10:27,582
If anyone wants to take a leak. Take it.

100
00:10:27,683 --> 00:10:29,583
This truck will not halt anywhere.

101
00:10:29,685 --> 00:10:33,587
It will stop somewhere. Where should we go?
- Here.

102
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:36,519
Quick!

103
00:10:42,298 --> 00:10:45,267
Be quick!
- Hey!

104
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:53,033
Gotu... what do you say?

105
00:10:56,078 --> 00:10:57,511
They are there at the back.

106
00:10:59,615 --> 00:11:03,051
The valley is very steep. They will miss us.

107
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:09,384
We are weak in our legs. We will not be able to run.

108
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:15,987
Think again. We will not get this chance again.

109
00:11:17,633 --> 00:11:23,503
Come back!
- Pal!
- Quick!

110
00:11:23,939 --> 00:11:26,032
We are coming. Coming.

111
00:11:30,946 --> 00:11:32,573
Easy. Easy.

112
00:11:32,948 --> 00:11:37,908
There's no life in me!
- Come on now! It's ok! Come on! Come on!

113
00:11:41,957 --> 00:11:44,050
Did you get it? Give it to me.

114
00:11:46,962 --> 00:11:52,992
Brother, can I get a cigarette?
- Hey, smoking is not allowed here.

115
00:11:53,969 --> 00:11:55,903
But asking is allowed, isn't it?

116
00:12:17,226 --> 00:12:18,454
Hey! Come out!

117
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,258
Check their nominal rolls.

118
00:12:29,938 --> 00:12:32,964
Guards, make them stand in a line.
- Come on!

119
00:12:36,445 --> 00:12:41,246
Are these our men?
- I am seeing them.

120
00:12:41,683 --> 00:12:43,412
And there are such jails also here?

121
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:48,053
What do you say Gotu?
- I cannot believe it.

122
00:12:49,558 --> 00:12:51,048
Has this country changed?

123
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:01,599
Guards! Attention!
- Attention!

124
00:13:05,941 --> 00:13:09,638
Hey Gotu, does the bedding smell so nice?

125
00:13:10,946 --> 00:13:12,914
In Multan we used to sleep on the ground.

126
00:13:13,081 --> 00:13:15,049
If we get some ground then, sir.

127
00:13:15,451 --> 00:13:19,114
If there are 35 inmates in one cell. How would we get space?

128
00:13:19,621 --> 00:13:23,250
You realized this before time.

129
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:24,614
From which unit, sir?

130
00:13:24,726 --> 00:13:28,059
21st squadron MIG 21, flight lieutenant Ram.

131
00:13:28,163 --> 00:13:32,065
And this...
- Gotu, flight lieutenant Gotu.

132
00:13:32,701 --> 00:13:34,999
We started off from Ambala together.

133
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:38,237
Came down together and then caught together.

134
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:39,967
How many jobs do you do together?

135
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:42,905
Now we are earning together, sir.

136
00:13:43,278 --> 00:13:44,575
Now we will get married together, isn't it?

137
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:47,376
Yes, you are right.
- Don't choose the same girl.

138
00:13:49,618 --> 00:13:50,607
Very good.
- When were you brought here?

139
00:13:50,953 --> 00:13:53,922
3 months before, sir.
- What is the meaning of getting us here?

140
00:13:54,022 --> 00:13:56,923
Sir, I have heard that before slaughtering a goat...

141
00:13:57,025 --> 00:13:58,993
...they feed it to its to heart's content.

142
00:13:59,294 --> 00:14:05,665
Shut up!
- Say sorry. Say sorry.
- Sorry sir.

143
00:14:09,004 --> 00:14:11,370
Sir, your clothes have been kept at your bed.

144
00:14:11,673 --> 00:14:13,300
If you want anything let us know.

145
00:14:13,675 --> 00:14:15,108
Can I get whiskey, Subedar?

146
00:14:16,011 --> 00:14:17,979
You all relax. If you want anything...

147
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,071
...ask Subedar Ahmed.

148
00:14:20,182 --> 00:14:23,913
Captain, I do not need Subedar Ahmed's help.

149
00:14:24,019 --> 00:14:25,418
I will help myself.

150
00:14:29,224 --> 00:14:30,418
Ok sir.

151
00:14:36,365 --> 00:14:37,992
Good night, sir.
- Good night.

152
00:14:50,612 --> 00:14:52,045
Sir, you did not sleep as yet.

153
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:58,586
I was just enjoying the breeze.

154
00:15:02,691 --> 00:15:04,124
How are they?

155
00:15:04,226 --> 00:15:07,252
The same, as we were 3 months back.

156
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:35,417
What is the matter, Ahmed?
- Nothing sir.

157
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,426
Thinking of your home?

158
00:15:40,696 --> 00:15:49,502
No. Just like that.
- We will reach. We will surely reach.

159
00:15:52,674 --> 00:15:55,507
Kabir, it must be raining in Delhi, isn't it?

160
00:15:56,612 --> 00:15:58,239
Yes sir, only if the weather bureau...

161
00:15:58,347 --> 00:16:00,042
...has given the right report for a change.

162
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:02,380
And in your Pune?

163
00:16:02,684 --> 00:16:04,914
Sir, all the 12 months the weather is pleasant there.

164
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:08,251
Pune is great that way. Jacob.
- Yes.

165
00:16:08,423 --> 00:16:10,254
It must be sunny in Cochin today, isn't it?

166
00:16:10,692 --> 00:16:14,253
Yes, very much. It rains before time.

167
00:16:15,564 --> 00:16:20,263
Yes Ahmed, what about Murshidabad?

168
00:16:21,103 --> 00:16:22,365
I do not know, sir.

169
00:16:23,672 --> 00:16:26,106
My wife was 3 months pregnant when I had left her.

170
00:16:29,211 --> 00:16:31,236
By now both must have been born.

171
00:16:31,947 --> 00:16:33,972
Why are you mocking me, sir? When I am here...

172
00:16:34,082 --> 00:16:35,982
...how can a second one be born.

173
00:16:36,151 --> 00:16:40,053
Why? Can't you have twins?

174
00:16:43,692 --> 00:16:46,456
Get up. Come on, cheer up.

175
00:16:47,696 --> 00:16:52,190
'Ahmed is worried... thinking of his family.'

176
00:16:53,235 --> 00:16:57,365
'We all are worried... thinking of our India.'

177
00:16:58,206 --> 00:17:00,231
'Thinking of our own families.'

178
00:17:01,943 --> 00:17:05,379
'We tolerated this pain, so we are alive.'

179
00:17:06,415 --> 00:17:10,112
'Those who couldn't tolerate it, they went to barrack No.7.'

180
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:14,588
'They are labeled as insane.'

181
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:21,392
Why did India forget us? We don't know.

182
00:17:22,297 --> 00:17:27,064
Why does Pakistan want to forget us? We don't know.

183
00:17:28,503 --> 00:17:33,406
'Well, there is no better support than hope to stay alive.'

184
00:17:34,409 --> 00:17:36,309
'I too am surviving on hope.'

185
00:17:36,411 --> 00:17:40,575
Sometimes... we meet our kin.

186
00:17:41,016 --> 00:17:45,544
'But hope does not mean to remain idle.'

187
00:17:46,455 --> 00:17:49,618
'I will be waiting for tomorrow, once again.'

188
00:17:53,562 --> 00:17:55,996
Greetings brother!
- Greetings!

189
00:17:56,431 --> 00:17:59,923
I am Ahmed. Subedar Ahmed. I was just strolling...

190
00:18:00,035 --> 00:18:01,525
...saw you and thought I should talk to you.

191
00:18:01,636 --> 00:18:03,968
It nothing. Just like that.
- It's ok.

192
00:18:04,673 --> 00:18:07,369
Have a meat roll
- No, thank you.

193
00:18:07,609 --> 00:18:12,512
Have it! Have at least one!
- Hey, they are hot.

194
00:18:12,614 --> 00:18:13,603
Where did you get them from?

195
00:18:13,715 --> 00:18:19,244
From Mansira.
- You must be tired. 49 hours journey...

196
00:18:19,621 --> 00:18:22,055
No, it took just took 9 hours.

197
00:18:26,962 --> 00:18:28,520
Sir, yes! Chess!

198
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:36,899
What did you know?
- Mansira, 9 hours from here, sir!

199
00:18:37,005 --> 00:18:39,030
And the jeep belongs to Islamabad, sir.

200
00:18:40,609 --> 00:18:44,568
There no big station out here. Does anyone know?
- I remember, sir.

201
00:18:45,113 --> 00:18:49,641
There is a small area, here.
- Sure.
- Yes, sir!

202
00:18:52,354 --> 00:18:54,652
Mansira was here.
- Right sir!

203
00:18:57,159 --> 00:19:02,062
If we start north from Islamabad, then...

204
00:19:04,499 --> 00:19:11,029
...where do we reach. Mansira is here and we are here!

205
00:19:12,007 --> 00:19:16,376
Right in the east of Abudabad.
- Right sir!

206
00:19:17,145 --> 00:19:19,909
We cannot be to the west of Abudabad...

207
00:19:20,015 --> 00:19:22,040
...because there are mountains all around.
- You are right.

208
00:19:23,285 --> 00:19:28,917
If you go towards east from here after about 40-45 kms...

209
00:19:29,024 --> 00:19:35,930
...we are at Muzafarabad. And after about 100 kms to the east...

210
00:19:36,031 --> 00:19:42,197
...we have Baramulla and then Puri, which is our India!

211
00:19:47,943 --> 00:19:51,106
Oh! We are so close to the border!

212
00:19:52,681 --> 00:19:54,239
Absolute nonsense!

213
00:19:54,549 --> 00:19:56,915
You are talking of the impossible!

214
00:19:57,018 --> 00:19:58,918
Ajob is possible only if it is attempted.

215
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:00,248
This thing does not fall in that category.

216
00:20:00,555 --> 00:20:02,420
You want to cross the border by deceiving...

217
00:20:02,524 --> 00:20:04,924
...a country's whole military and their intelligence?

218
00:20:05,093 --> 00:20:07,425
That too without a passport and without documents.

219
00:20:08,163 --> 00:20:10,927
First of all the question is of escaping from here, sir.

220
00:20:11,032 --> 00:20:12,590
I am not thinking of that question at all, major.

221
00:20:12,968 --> 00:20:14,526
Because there is no solution to it.

222
00:20:14,636 --> 00:20:16,228
Solutions are found if you search for them, sir.

223
00:20:16,671 --> 00:20:19,902
We will not get such a chance to stay together near the border.

224
00:20:20,008 --> 00:20:21,441
Nor a chance to die together!

225
00:20:21,543 --> 00:20:24,603
But sir, what is the guarantee that we will reach India alive.

226
00:20:24,713 --> 00:20:27,113
When officers are talking don't interrupt!

227
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:29,510
Sorry sir!

228
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:33,978
Captain!
- Sir!

229
00:20:34,089 --> 00:20:36,250
There is a difference to stay close to the border...

230
00:20:36,358 --> 00:20:38,383
...and to cross the border.

231
00:20:38,627 --> 00:20:40,117
This is not a movie scene which is going on.

232
00:20:40,362 --> 00:20:44,128
Then what should we do? Should we sit idle?

233
00:20:44,966 --> 00:20:48,402
Why? We can wait for the repatriation.

234
00:20:48,503 --> 00:20:50,164
We have been waiting for the past 6 years, sir.

235
00:20:50,272 --> 00:20:52,240
The repatriation has not happened as yet.

236
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:54,570
Repatriation is a big thing, Captain.

237
00:20:54,943 --> 00:20:59,642
To return so many prisoners is not a small thing. It takes time.

238
00:20:59,948 --> 00:21:02,246
And that time should make us insane.

239
00:21:04,219 --> 00:21:06,653
Major, everyone knows that we are here.

240
00:21:07,956 --> 00:21:09,583
Every newspaper has this news.

241
00:21:09,691 --> 00:21:11,921
Red Cross Society and all the international agencies...

242
00:21:12,027 --> 00:21:14,928
...know this news that according to the Geneva Convention...

243
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:16,930
...it is an international law...

244
00:21:17,032 --> 00:21:20,001
...to return all the prisoners after the war ends.

245
00:21:20,969 --> 00:21:23,904
And no country breaks this law easily!

246
00:21:24,105 --> 00:21:25,902
What will you say about...

247
00:21:26,007 --> 00:21:27,907
...the 6 years which we spent...

248
00:21:28,009 --> 00:21:29,567
...according to the Geneva Convention?

249
00:21:29,678 --> 00:21:32,579
Yes. So. The change is before your eyes.

250
00:21:33,114 --> 00:21:36,641
Seeing this camp don't you think that they have realized it.

251
00:21:36,751 --> 00:21:38,912
This is exactly my question, sir...

252
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:42,581
...that isn't this sudden realization in itself a shocking matter?

253
00:21:42,691 --> 00:21:46,923
Bringing us from different jails and keeping us together...

254
00:21:47,028 --> 00:21:52,125
...and that too near the border, don't you smell a plan in this?

255
00:22:22,497 --> 00:22:24,988
This was the last jail to be examined.

256
00:22:25,166 --> 00:22:29,626
Now what do you say?
- You speak, Anuradha.

257
00:22:30,939 --> 00:22:34,033
But the letter was sent from Pakistan, isn't it?

258
00:22:35,477 --> 00:22:37,911
It is clearly written in it that we are alive...

259
00:22:38,013 --> 00:22:40,038
...and are held captive in jails of Pakistan

260
00:22:41,616 --> 00:22:45,052
And I can very well recognize my husband's handwriting.

261
00:22:46,421 --> 00:22:50,653
Look you have taken pains to come here from Delhi.

262
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,656
Even the Red Cross has come so far on your insistence.

263
00:22:55,964 --> 00:22:58,660
Every jail has been examined before you.

264
00:23:00,368 --> 00:23:02,893
As the head of the Pakistan Human Rights Commission...

265
00:23:03,004 --> 00:23:05,905
...I assure you that no Indian soldier of the 1971 war...

266
00:23:06,007 --> 00:23:09,101
...are here.

267
00:23:14,282 --> 00:23:15,977
Now what should we do!?

268
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,591
Thank you colonel. You took lot of trouble.

269
00:23:28,696 --> 00:23:30,926
It is not the question of trouble. This was my duty.

270
00:23:31,032 --> 00:23:33,592
There are some formalities to be completed.

271
00:23:34,702 --> 00:23:37,227
Just sign these papers.
- What is written in them?

272
00:23:37,338 --> 00:23:39,898
It is written that you are satisfied with your inspection...

273
00:23:40,008 --> 00:23:42,408
...and that after inspection you have found...

274
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:44,978
...that there is no prisoner of the 1971 war.

275
00:23:46,414 --> 00:23:48,041
What do you say, sir?

276
00:23:51,686 --> 00:23:53,085
Alright.

277
00:24:01,696 --> 00:24:05,132
This cannot happen! He is alive!

278
00:24:06,501 --> 00:24:09,231
He is alive! I will not believe!

279
00:24:11,439 --> 00:24:12,963
What has happened?

280
00:24:14,943 --> 00:24:16,433
This cannot happen!

281
00:24:25,954 --> 00:24:28,923
Sir, your idea was successful! We sent the entire PoW's...

282
00:24:29,023 --> 00:24:31,116
...from different jails together to Chaklala.

283
00:24:31,292 --> 00:24:32,919
Or else even if a single one would have been seen...

284
00:24:33,027 --> 00:24:34,255
...by the Red Cross...

285
00:24:34,362 --> 00:24:35,420
...then it would be very shameful for the country.

286
00:24:36,431 --> 00:24:38,331
They have signed the papers.

287
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,934
But we have to be careful that until the Red Cross...

288
00:24:41,035 --> 00:24:42,900
...is in Pakistan there should not be any chaos...

289
00:24:43,004 --> 00:24:44,904
...in the Chaklala camp, sir.

290
00:24:46,107 --> 00:24:47,972
I will take care of that.

291
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:50,500
You start preparing to proceed to the Chaklala camp.

292
00:24:50,612 --> 00:24:52,102
Very well sir.

293
00:24:57,418 --> 00:25:00,114
I prepared the Kashmir's steamed potato many times.

294
00:25:00,688 --> 00:25:03,589
Where is your partner?
- Sir, he is inside teaching how to cook.

295
00:25:03,691 --> 00:25:06,922
Should I call him? Just wait! Hey, pal!
- Yes!

296
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:19,929
Come!

297
00:25:20,041 --> 00:25:21,633
What was going on inside?
- Nothing sir.

298
00:25:21,743 --> 00:25:23,404
I was teaching them how to prepare Kashmir's steamed potato.

299
00:25:24,546 --> 00:25:27,242
Now you will feed the Pakistani's with the Kashmir's steamed potato?

300
00:25:27,348 --> 00:25:29,248
Where am I feeding them, sir? There is only one place, where...

301
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:30,977
...my cooking is accepted.

302
00:25:32,353 --> 00:25:36,050
Come sir. Sir, this is the signal room, sir.

303
00:25:36,691 --> 00:25:38,989
All the electricity in the camp is conducted from here.

304
00:25:39,294 --> 00:25:42,058
Even the spare battery is recharged here, sir.
- Ok.

305
00:25:42,497 --> 00:25:44,465
Sir, I have purposely fitted it in my office.

306
00:25:44,566 --> 00:25:46,932
So that nobody has any access to it sir.

307
00:25:47,035 --> 00:25:50,402
Good.
- Sir, since tonight all the fans will start functioning.

308
00:25:50,939 --> 00:25:52,406
Siren will also be operative, sir.

309
00:25:52,674 --> 00:25:54,403
I mean full proof security, sir.

310
00:25:55,009 --> 00:25:56,567
Very good.
- Thank you, sir.

311
00:26:00,682 --> 00:26:04,413
Come colonel, sit. There is a bad news for you.

312
00:26:06,554 --> 00:26:10,115
You are being handed over to India.

313
00:26:11,626 --> 00:26:15,255
What!?
- Yes, the procedure has been completed.

314
00:26:15,363 --> 00:26:17,058
Major.
- Yes, sir.

315
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:20,930
This is copy of the repatriation.

316
00:26:21,369 --> 00:26:23,303
And this is the copy for the Red Cross.

317
00:26:28,676 --> 00:26:30,371
Congratulations Colonel!
- Thank you, sir!

318
00:26:30,478 --> 00:26:31,911
I had just come to give this news.

319
00:26:32,013 --> 00:26:33,412
And as for the stay at the camp.

320
00:26:33,615 --> 00:26:36,584
Until you are here, be our guest.

321
00:26:36,684 --> 00:26:40,051
But... how did this happen so suddenly?

322
00:26:41,489 --> 00:26:43,923
Look, this does not happen suddenly.

323
00:26:44,225 --> 00:26:45,988
These matters take some time.

324
00:26:46,227 --> 00:26:48,058
Process is going on since many months.

325
00:26:48,429 --> 00:26:52,422
It may take... 2... to 3... months still.

326
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:57,904
There is a big buffet for you on behalf of Colonel.

327
00:26:58,139 --> 00:27:01,108
And along with it... sir will you say it.

328
00:27:02,277 --> 00:27:05,246
You must have not seen a movie for a long time.

329
00:27:06,481 --> 00:27:08,312
These days there has been a very popular movie.

330
00:27:09,217 --> 00:27:11,048
So we will screen it in the open ground.

331
00:27:13,221 --> 00:27:18,181
I... I cant believe it!
- You better believe it, Colonel.

332
00:27:18,293 --> 00:27:21,262
Our nation is not that bad as you think it to be.

333
00:27:21,562 --> 00:27:23,052
Good luck!

334
00:27:23,965 --> 00:27:28,061
Thank you, sir!
- No, you keep this with you.

335
00:27:28,569 --> 00:27:32,027
Inform others too.
- Alright.

336
00:27:49,090 --> 00:27:50,921
"Lots of happiness has been bestowed."

337
00:27:51,025 --> 00:27:53,585
"That girl is blushing inside her veil."

338
00:27:53,695 --> 00:27:58,257
"I feel like unveiling her...

339
00:27:58,466 --> 00:28:00,593
...the Jat keeps moving behind."

340
00:28:00,702 --> 00:28:03,296
"She keeps moving ahead."

341
00:28:03,404 --> 00:28:07,966
"I feel like embracing her."

342
00:28:08,142 --> 00:28:12,579
"I feel like dancing the Bhangra."

343
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:15,581
"I feel like dancing the Bhangra."

344
00:28:15,683 --> 00:28:17,913
"I feel like dancing the Bhangra."

345
00:28:18,019 --> 00:28:20,180
"I feel like dancing the Bhangra."

346
00:28:20,288 --> 00:28:22,654
"I feel like dancing the Bhangra."

347
00:28:22,757 --> 00:28:25,123
"I feel like dancing the Bhangra."

348
00:28:25,226 --> 00:28:27,387
"I feel like dancing the Bhangra."

349
00:28:27,495 --> 00:28:34,992
"I feel like... dancing the Bhangra."

350
00:28:37,138 --> 00:28:39,106
"I came to the fair with my friends."

351
00:28:39,207 --> 00:28:41,903
"We saw a group of maidens."

352
00:28:42,009 --> 00:28:46,503
"No one wants to go back."

353
00:28:46,681 --> 00:28:50,583
"Howsoever one tries; no one can break our friendship."

354
00:28:50,685 --> 00:28:55,987
"I feel like singing."

355
00:28:56,157 --> 00:29:00,924
"I feel like dancing the Bhangra."

356
00:29:01,028 --> 00:29:03,588
"I feel like dancing the Bhangra."

357
00:29:03,698 --> 00:29:05,928
"I feel like dancing the Bhangra."

358
00:29:06,033 --> 00:29:08,331
"I feel like dancing the Bhangra."

359
00:29:08,436 --> 00:29:10,904
"I feel like dancing the Bhangra."

360
00:29:11,005 --> 00:29:13,166
"I feel like dancing the Bhangra."

361
00:29:13,274 --> 00:29:15,572
"I feel like dancing the Bhangra."

362
00:29:15,676 --> 00:29:22,980
"I feel like... dancing the Bhangra."

363
00:29:27,688 --> 00:29:29,918
"Let the world come together...

364
00:29:30,024 --> 00:29:32,424
...it will not be able to stop our Bhangra."

365
00:29:32,527 --> 00:29:34,427
"Let the world come together...

366
00:29:34,529 --> 00:29:37,089
...it will not be able to stop our Bhangra."

367
00:29:37,198 --> 00:29:39,393
"Let the world come together...

368
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,991
...it will not be able to stop our Bhangra."

369
00:29:42,103 --> 00:29:46,403
"I feel like saying this..."

370
00:29:46,607 --> 00:29:50,907
"I feel like dancing the Bhangra."

371
00:29:51,546 --> 00:29:56,381
"I feel like dancing the Bhangra."

372
00:29:56,484 --> 00:29:59,044
"I feel like dancing the Bhangra."

373
00:29:59,153 --> 00:30:01,246
"I feel like dancing the Bhangra."

374
00:30:01,355 --> 00:30:03,915
"I feel like dancing the Bhangra."

375
00:30:04,025 --> 00:30:06,050
"I feel like dancing the Bhangra."

376
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:08,424
"I feel like dancing the Bhangra."

377
00:30:08,529 --> 00:30:15,059
"I feel like... dancing the Bhangra."

378
00:30:19,941 --> 00:30:22,910
Congratulations!
- Sir!
- Sir!

379
00:30:25,813 --> 00:30:29,544
So Major! Your dream to become a hero is unfulfilled.

380
00:30:30,451 --> 00:30:33,545
It doesn't matter sir. I will go back and join the film industry.

381
00:30:35,289 --> 00:30:38,520
Right! There are some things which look good in films.

382
00:31:16,364 --> 00:31:18,059
Sir, it is urgent.

383
00:31:43,357 --> 00:31:49,592
What happened sir?
- I was not wrong, Captain.

384
00:31:54,702 --> 00:31:56,101
Ahmed.

385
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:03,408
As it is said by the families of the captive soldiers of 1971 war...

386
00:32:03,511 --> 00:32:07,413
...has requested the Red Cross Society...

387
00:32:07,515 --> 00:32:11,508
...to assist them in finding them.

388
00:32:12,353 --> 00:32:14,913
They accuse that the condition of the soldiers...

389
00:32:15,022 --> 00:32:16,990
...in different jails is very bad.

390
00:32:17,224 --> 00:32:18,987
They should be detected as soon as possible.

391
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:23,062
And steps to send them back to India should be taken.

392
00:32:24,298 --> 00:32:26,926
General Zia-ul-Haq has given the Red Cross permission...

393
00:32:27,034 --> 00:32:30,435
...to inspect every jail in the country.

394
00:32:30,538 --> 00:32:34,497
Zia-ul-Haq! What happened to Bhutto?

395
00:32:34,942 --> 00:32:37,410
Captain, the government in Pakistan has changed.

396
00:32:38,679 --> 00:32:40,306
Military rule has taken over.

397
00:32:41,616 --> 00:32:43,243
General Zia-ul-Haq's government...

398
00:32:43,351 --> 00:32:45,251
...has permitted the new Red Cross to inspect...

399
00:32:45,353 --> 00:32:46,980
...every jail in the country.

400
00:32:47,221 --> 00:32:48,415
And has openly announced that...

401
00:32:48,522 --> 00:32:49,921
...according to the Simla treaty...

402
00:32:50,024 --> 00:32:51,924
...all the Indian soldiers of the 1971 war...

403
00:32:52,026 --> 00:32:53,516
...have been returned.

404
00:32:54,028 --> 00:32:56,929
And right now no Indian soldier is present...

405
00:32:57,031 --> 00:32:58,589
...in any Pakistan jail.

406
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:03,898
India has to think five times before making...

407
00:33:04,005 --> 00:33:07,634
...any false and irresponsible accusations.

408
00:33:12,146 --> 00:33:13,443
What is the meaning of this?

409
00:33:15,149 --> 00:33:17,913
It means that the Red Cross is in Pakistan...

410
00:33:18,019 --> 00:33:21,386
...at this moment.

411
00:33:23,357 --> 00:33:25,985
And they fear that they would come here.

412
00:33:26,961 --> 00:33:29,987
There is immense tension on the border and...

413
00:33:30,097 --> 00:33:32,122
...we are very close to the border.

414
00:33:34,435 --> 00:33:37,893
We have made an attempt to escape from here.

415
00:33:38,673 --> 00:33:40,903
And they want to be sure that until we are here...

416
00:33:41,008 --> 00:33:43,306
...another attempt is not made.

417
00:33:48,149 --> 00:33:51,915
As soon as the Red Cross leaves Pakistan...

418
00:33:52,019 --> 00:33:55,045
...this camp will be closed.

419
00:33:55,623 --> 00:33:57,921
And we will be sent back to the same place...

420
00:33:58,025 --> 00:33:59,424
...from where we were brought.

421
00:34:00,161 --> 00:34:02,925
And the world wouldn't know...

422
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:06,989
...when we died in the Pakistan jails.

423
00:34:12,339 --> 00:34:15,570
But such a thing cannot happen.

424
00:34:17,344 --> 00:34:18,971
I have full faith.

425
00:34:20,347 --> 00:34:23,043
They are taking care of us.

426
00:34:24,685 --> 00:34:28,052
And they cannot say such a big lie.

427
00:34:29,290 --> 00:34:34,592
I think it would be a big sin to doubt their honesty.
- Sir!

428
00:34:36,564 --> 00:34:42,127
I have full faith that they will implement what they said.

429
00:34:43,337 --> 00:34:47,433
And we will be sent back to India.

430
00:34:48,943 --> 00:34:52,379
Sir, don't hit! Don't hit! Don't hit!
- Sir! Sir!

431
00:34:54,014 --> 00:34:55,038
What did you hear?

432
00:34:55,149 --> 00:34:58,050
The same which we doubted.
- What?

433
00:34:58,419 --> 00:35:01,582
The same which you doubted.
- What do you mean?

434
00:35:01,689 --> 00:35:04,385
I mean that we had thought of it on the way, sir.

435
00:35:04,492 --> 00:35:06,517
We did not have the energy left. Or else...

436
00:35:06,627 --> 00:35:07,924
Or else, we had already thought of fleeing...

437
00:35:08,028 --> 00:35:09,586
...before reaching here, sir.

438
00:35:09,697 --> 00:35:12,257
Yes sir. Yes sir. And after going out from here...

439
00:35:12,366 --> 00:35:15,267
...the first thing you will need is this, sir.

440
00:35:27,615 --> 00:35:29,048
Leave them.

441
00:35:30,951 --> 00:35:33,317
Thank you sir! Thank you sir!

442
00:35:35,122 --> 00:35:37,249
Burn this tabloid, Ahmed!
- Ok sir.

443
00:35:38,225 --> 00:35:41,058
And no one should know of this thing outside.

444
00:35:41,428 --> 00:35:43,988
Yes sir.
- And keep one thing in mind...

445
00:35:44,098 --> 00:35:46,999
...that we have very less time on hand.

446
00:35:48,702 --> 00:35:49,896
Whatever we have to do...

447
00:35:50,004 --> 00:35:51,096
...we have to do it from tomorrow itself.

448
00:35:51,939 --> 00:35:55,306
Why from tomorrow, sir? Why not from today itself?

449
00:35:55,676 --> 00:35:57,041
Why not right now?

450
00:35:58,412 --> 00:35:59,640
What do you mean?

451
00:36:01,682 --> 00:36:03,513
Sir. Sir.
- What is it?
- Sir, we have a request.

452
00:36:03,617 --> 00:36:04,914
We wanted a group photograph.

453
00:36:05,019 --> 00:36:06,008
You are not standing in the queue.

454
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,246
Sir, we had come to request you.

455
00:36:07,354 --> 00:36:10,118
What was the name of that place near Jamma Masjid?

456
00:36:10,691 --> 00:36:12,386
Karim
- Yes! Karim!

457
00:36:12,493 --> 00:36:15,428
Sir, they wanted a group photograph, sir.

458
00:36:16,363 --> 00:36:18,331
Please sir, it is a request sir. Please.

459
00:36:18,465 --> 00:36:22,265
Sure. Sure. Ah... where are you two from.

460
00:36:23,270 --> 00:36:25,500
I am from Delhi, sir.
- And you?

461
00:36:25,673 --> 00:36:27,300
Sir, Srinagar! Kashmir!

462
00:36:27,608 --> 00:36:29,098
Have you ever been there?

463
00:36:29,944 --> 00:36:33,038
Not at least on the other side of Kashmir.

464
00:36:34,181 --> 00:36:36,274
Both of you were saying about a group photograph.

465
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:37,739
Please sir. This is a request, sir. Please.

466
00:36:38,085 --> 00:36:39,450
So go and organise it. We are coming.

467
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:40,814
Thank you very much, sir.
- Thank you sir.

468
00:36:43,691 --> 00:36:45,989
'And our mission had started.'

469
00:36:46,694 --> 00:36:50,596
'We had decided that we will escape from here.'

470
00:36:51,699 --> 00:36:56,398
'The day was fixed. That is the Pakistani Independence Day.'

471
00:36:57,538 --> 00:37:00,905
'The same night, in the presence of Colonel Puri...

472
00:37:01,008 --> 00:37:04,034
...Subedar Ahmed slapped captain Jacob.'

473
00:37:04,612 --> 00:37:06,910
'For which in the next day's morning parade...

474
00:37:07,014 --> 00:37:09,414
...he was asked to load a weight of 10 Kgs...

475
00:37:09,516 --> 00:37:11,643
...on his head and walk as punishment.'

476
00:37:13,487 --> 00:37:15,978
Parade! Attention!

477
00:37:17,424 --> 00:37:18,584
Look in front!

478
00:37:18,692 --> 00:37:20,455
Parade! At ease!

479
00:37:20,561 --> 00:37:21,926
Sir, I will not walk any more.

480
00:37:22,029 --> 00:37:23,656
I am saying pick it up! Pick up!

481
00:37:23,964 --> 00:37:24,988
You are not my senior!

482
00:37:25,099 --> 00:37:26,930
I am your senior's, senior!

483
00:37:27,034 --> 00:37:28,934
Then where were you until now!
- Don't argue with me!

484
00:37:29,003 --> 00:37:31,563
You!
- Don't abuse me!

485
00:37:32,439 --> 00:37:36,398
How did you abuse him?
- Sir! Sir!

486
00:37:37,144 --> 00:37:39,612
Sir! He had talked to me like this!

487
00:37:39,713 --> 00:37:41,977
You ask me to get food for you! I will say it once again!

488
00:37:42,082 --> 00:37:43,106
If you will not take care of your seniors...

489
00:37:43,217 --> 00:37:44,241
...then who will take care.

490
00:37:47,488 --> 00:37:48,512
If you would have been in India...

491
00:37:48,622 --> 00:37:49,611
...you would be court-martial.

492
00:37:49,723 --> 00:37:50,917
Then do my court-martial.

493
00:37:51,025 --> 00:37:53,926
Ok, enough! Major Suraj Singh...

494
00:37:54,028 --> 00:37:55,928
...I want to start the proceedings...

495
00:37:56,030 --> 00:37:57,622
...of his court-martial right now.

496
00:37:57,731 --> 00:38:00,928
Sir, this is PoW camp not your battalion!

497
00:38:01,035 --> 00:38:02,559
And we are in another nation.

498
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:05,969
But we are in the army? And rules are rules!

499
00:38:06,206 --> 00:38:09,505
Sir, will this court-martial be valid in India.

500
00:38:09,610 --> 00:38:12,101
After reaching India we will not be removed from the army!

501
00:38:12,212 --> 00:38:13,975
We will have to resume our duties!

502
00:38:14,148 --> 00:38:15,445
But there is no legal set up here!

503
00:38:15,549 --> 00:38:16,982
Legal set up can be created!

504
00:38:17,084 --> 00:38:18,449
Colonel Puri is right!

505
00:38:19,086 --> 00:38:21,111
I would like to prosecute this case!

506
00:38:24,692 --> 00:38:26,592
Come Ahmed.
- Sir, this baldy.

507
00:38:26,694 --> 00:38:28,127
Come on! Come on!

508
00:38:30,965 --> 00:38:32,990
Come, everybody. Follow me.

509
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:34,260
Come sir.

510
00:38:37,671 --> 00:38:39,229
Good Ahmed!
- Thank you sir.

511
00:38:42,676 --> 00:38:44,303
Anew disturbance has been created in the camp.

512
00:38:44,411 --> 00:38:46,402
Yes they are going to court-martial him.

513
00:38:48,082 --> 00:38:50,380
They have requested for a court to be set up in the barrack.

514
00:38:51,151 --> 00:38:52,175
They are saying that they will give...

515
00:38:52,286 --> 00:38:53,412
...their verdict by 15th August.

516
00:38:54,488 --> 00:38:56,251
As it is you are coming on 14th August.

517
00:38:56,623 --> 00:38:58,454
What do you say Colonel Sheriar?

518
00:38:58,692 --> 00:39:02,253
Let them proceed. It is a matter of 1-2 months.

519
00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:04,993
We will have fewer tensions.

520
00:39:05,499 --> 00:39:07,126
Ok permission granted.
- Sir.

521
00:39:07,634 --> 00:39:08,931
But there are orders to celebrate...

522
00:39:09,003 --> 00:39:10,231
...14th August in pomp and grandeur.

523
00:39:10,437 --> 00:39:13,031
It is the first independence day of General Zia.

524
00:39:13,941 --> 00:39:15,966
He has come to power after a long time.

525
00:39:16,343 --> 00:39:17,503
Let's see what he does.

526
00:39:17,611 --> 00:39:18,600
What arrangements have been made Major?

527
00:39:18,712 --> 00:39:20,509
I have talked personally to Begum Sultana, sir.

528
00:39:20,681 --> 00:39:22,376
She has agreed to it.

529
00:39:22,683 --> 00:39:25,311
Every camp on the border will bathe in festivities, sir.

530
00:39:25,419 --> 00:39:26,909
Very good.
- Sir that...

531
00:39:27,021 --> 00:39:28,386
Sir one more thing.

532
00:39:28,489 --> 00:39:29,922
Sir they want to celebrate their Independence Day...

533
00:39:30,024 --> 00:39:31,116
...on the 15th of August.

534
00:39:31,358 --> 00:39:32,450
They have demanded some...

535
00:39:32,559 --> 00:39:33,992
...new clothes for the occasion.

536
00:39:34,695 --> 00:39:36,458
And also asked for some colours...

537
00:39:36,563 --> 00:39:38,531
...and some dyes to paint the flag, sir.

538
00:39:38,632 --> 00:39:40,532
Are they in a position to demand?

539
00:39:44,405 --> 00:39:45,394
Give them. Give them.

540
00:39:45,506 --> 00:39:46,495
But everything should be done...

541
00:39:46,607 --> 00:39:47,596
...under your observation.
- Be rest assured, sir.

542
00:39:47,708 --> 00:39:50,108
'The next morning, parade...

543
00:39:50,210 --> 00:39:52,906
...for the Pakistan's Independence Day...

544
00:39:53,013 --> 00:39:55,038
...had started in the Chaklala camp.'

545
00:39:55,949 --> 00:39:59,646
'The sound of the Pakistan band was echoing all around.'

546
00:40:00,487 --> 00:40:05,049
'And along with them we started our preparations.'

547
00:40:08,962 --> 00:40:10,327
Take this. Take this. These are new uniforms.

548
00:40:10,431 --> 00:40:11,591
Wear them for 15th August.

549
00:40:12,099 --> 00:40:13,532
Come, my beloved.

550
00:40:13,634 --> 00:40:15,534
It is been ages since we wore new uniforms.

551
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:19,901
Paint it completely. Completely.

552
00:40:20,074 --> 00:40:21,974
Hey! Hey! Hey!

553
00:40:22,943 --> 00:40:25,969
Bother, this green colour has spilled.

554
00:40:26,447 --> 00:40:27,971
Can we get some more?

555
00:40:28,682 --> 00:40:32,049
Don't put all at once.

556
00:40:39,226 --> 00:40:41,421
Listen, don't ask for more colour. They will doubt us.

557
00:40:41,695 --> 00:40:44,061
There is quite enough.
- Let's see.

558
00:40:44,698 --> 00:40:46,063
Will they appear like Pakistan uniforms?

559
00:40:46,567 --> 00:40:48,000
They will appear after drying.

560
00:40:48,168 --> 00:40:49,965
But listen, the question is of dyeing them.

561
00:40:50,604 --> 00:40:53,038
For that we need fire.
- For that we will need a kiln.

562
00:40:53,474 --> 00:40:55,305
They will not allow us to dig a pit to make a kiln.

563
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:00,977
Do one thing.
- What?

564
00:41:01,148 --> 00:41:02,240
Fill up the jaggery.

565
00:41:02,616 --> 00:41:04,106
Adrink of jaggery?
- Yes sir.

566
00:41:04,485 --> 00:41:06,043
It is very delicious, sir.

567
00:41:06,153 --> 00:41:08,121
There is place near Delhi called Gurgaon.

568
00:41:08,288 --> 00:41:09,448
It is prepared there, sir.

569
00:41:09,556 --> 00:41:10,580
How will you prepare it?

570
00:41:10,691 --> 00:41:11,988
First we will fill the pot with jaggery...

571
00:41:12,092 --> 00:41:13,116
...and bury it in the ground...

572
00:41:13,227 --> 00:41:15,252
...and then take it out and boil it. That's it.

573
00:41:15,362 --> 00:41:16,420
Which means that you will need a kiln.

574
00:41:16,530 --> 00:41:20,990
Yes sir.
- Ok. The pit should not be 1 feet deep.

575
00:41:21,135 --> 00:41:22,261
It would not be, sir.

576
00:41:22,336 --> 00:41:23,360
Look.
- Yes sir.

577
00:41:23,470 --> 00:41:24,562
Everything will be done under your observation.

578
00:41:24,671 --> 00:41:25,899
Yes sir.

579
00:41:26,006 --> 00:41:27,564
Take back the instruments after the work is done.

580
00:41:27,674 --> 00:41:28,902
Yes sir.

581
00:41:29,009 --> 00:41:31,375
'Ahmed's court-martial had started.'

582
00:41:32,146 --> 00:41:35,912
'They were happy that our attention...

583
00:41:36,016 --> 00:41:39,110
...would be diverted from other plans.'

584
00:41:39,553 --> 00:41:42,920
'And it was our attempt that using this court-martial...

585
00:41:43,023 --> 00:41:46,925
...we could some how take Ahmed into...

586
00:41:47,027 --> 00:41:50,121
...Major Karamat's office.'

587
00:41:50,364 --> 00:41:51,592
How do you plead, Subedar?

588
00:41:51,698 --> 00:41:53,996
Guilty or not guilty!

589
00:41:57,471 --> 00:41:59,029
He pleads not guilty.

590
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:04,174
Now before you... Lieutenant Gotu will explain!

591
00:42:04,344 --> 00:42:06,403
Explain!
- Sir!

592
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:11,049
First we removed the bark of the Shikar tree!

593
00:42:11,151 --> 00:42:12,413
Removed!

594
00:42:12,953 --> 00:42:16,252
Then put it in the urn!
- Put it!

595
00:42:16,356 --> 00:42:17,448
One minute. One minute.

596
00:42:17,558 --> 00:42:19,116
Why did you put the bark of the Shikar tree?

597
00:42:20,627 --> 00:42:21,616
Brother, for flavour! Flavour!

598
00:42:21,728 --> 00:42:23,059
You see further.

599
00:42:25,566 --> 00:42:29,058
After that the jaggery is poured in the same urn!

600
00:42:30,404 --> 00:42:35,103
Poured it!
- Now you will close the urn! Close the urn!

601
00:42:36,543 --> 00:42:40,411
Closed it!
- Now wait for 1/2 and hour and then you have it.

602
00:42:41,114 --> 00:42:45,244
Will wait! Wait!
- Yes!

603
00:42:49,489 --> 00:42:50,979
"I was present, she was too."

604
00:42:51,158 --> 00:42:52,455
"I was present, she was too."

605
00:42:53,126 --> 00:42:54,650
"I was present, she was too."

606
00:42:54,761 --> 00:42:56,592
"And the weather was colourful."

607
00:42:56,697 --> 00:42:58,927
"And we got our prestige back, brother."

608
00:42:59,032 --> 00:43:00,260
"Did you understand?"

609
00:43:00,367 --> 00:43:03,564
"That means love is in the air."

610
00:43:03,670 --> 00:43:07,162
"Dear, you are set. Now what will happen of me?"

611
00:43:07,274 --> 00:43:10,971
"Dear, you are set. Now what will happen of me?"

612
00:43:13,413 --> 00:43:15,040
"Our kiln has started burning."

613
00:43:15,148 --> 00:43:16,581
"Our eyes started burning."

614
00:43:16,683 --> 00:43:19,117
"You cried and I also cried."

615
00:43:20,621 --> 00:43:24,182
"Just like the cow's milk this fresh one is prepared."

616
00:43:24,291 --> 00:43:26,259
"You saw, I saw."

617
00:43:28,028 --> 00:43:31,327
"Our fighter plane, crashed suddenly."

618
00:43:31,498 --> 00:43:33,591
"You died and I died."

619
00:43:35,435 --> 00:43:39,166
"And the weather was colourful."

620
00:43:39,506 --> 00:43:41,940
"And we got our prestige back, brother."

621
00:43:42,209 --> 00:43:43,233
"Did you understand?"

622
00:43:43,610 --> 00:43:46,545
"That means that the thing is ready."

623
00:43:48,949 --> 00:43:50,507
The court is adjourned till tomorrow.

624
00:43:50,617 --> 00:43:52,915
I object sir. Subedar Ahmed should be stopped...

625
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:55,511
...from being included in the parade on 15th August.

626
00:43:55,622 --> 00:44:00,389
No crime has been proved on Subedar Ahmed as yet.

627
00:44:00,494 --> 00:44:02,121
But he is under trial sir.

628
00:44:02,362 --> 00:44:04,262
And an under trial cannot participate in a parade.

629
00:44:04,364 --> 00:44:05,388
This is injustice, sir.

630
00:44:05,499 --> 00:44:07,330
After all we have fought for the Indian Armed Forces.

631
00:44:07,434 --> 00:44:10,562
And we are in-charge of the very same Indian armed forces!

632
00:44:13,006 --> 00:44:15,907
Objection of the prosecution is sustained.

633
00:44:16,009 --> 00:44:18,910
Subedar Ahmed is stopped from being included...

634
00:44:19,012 --> 00:44:21,071
...in the 15th August parade.

635
00:44:23,350 --> 00:44:25,910
Ok then, today's job is done.

636
00:44:26,019 --> 00:44:27,316
You will get the drink later. Ok.

637
00:44:44,137 --> 00:44:46,571
We had taken care of every possibility.

638
00:44:47,107 --> 00:44:49,632
We had taken care of every point of view.

639
00:44:50,444 --> 00:44:52,912
And we had come to a conclusion...

640
00:44:53,013 --> 00:44:55,914
...that during the night of festivities of 14th August...

641
00:44:56,016 --> 00:44:57,916
...there will be a big stampede.

642
00:44:58,018 --> 00:45:01,112
So that we could escape under that pretext.

643
00:45:02,089 --> 00:45:05,525
For a stampede we needed a bomb.

644
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:10,054
And for the explosion we needed a bomb.

645
00:45:10,964 --> 00:45:13,990
We did not have a bomb.

646
00:45:14,634 --> 00:45:18,035
Captain Jacob came up with an old idea.

647
00:45:20,941 --> 00:45:22,568
Sir, how much will be the explosion power, sir.

648
00:45:22,676 --> 00:45:26,237
Just like a lab explosion.
- Tight! Tight!

649
00:45:26,346 --> 00:45:27,574
Hold it from down.

650
00:45:29,216 --> 00:45:30,410
Give the bigger end.

651
00:45:32,085 --> 00:45:34,110
Hold it tight! Very tight!
- Yes, sir!

652
00:45:34,221 --> 00:45:35,449
Tight! Tight!

653
00:45:35,555 --> 00:45:37,318
Turn it. Turn it.

654
00:45:37,491 --> 00:45:40,585
Nobody saw who raised hands on whom first.

655
00:45:40,961 --> 00:45:42,258
Why didn't you give the same punishment...

656
00:45:42,362 --> 00:45:43,454
...to Captain Jacob.

657
00:45:43,630 --> 00:45:44,995
Don't mind major.

658
00:45:45,165 --> 00:45:47,998
Were you not taking Subedar Ahmed's side...

659
00:45:48,101 --> 00:45:49,966
...because he was your confidante.

660
00:45:50,337 --> 00:45:54,899
Please don't mind sir. You have been hating...

661
00:45:55,008 --> 00:45:58,171
...Subedar Ahmed because he is a Muslim.

662
00:46:02,549 --> 00:46:06,383
Major, you can complain against me after reaching India.

663
00:46:06,486 --> 00:46:07,976
The question is of the present.

664
00:46:08,622 --> 00:46:10,317
Of his mental state.

665
00:46:12,025 --> 00:46:14,619
If he goes against the country because of this torture.

666
00:46:14,728 --> 00:46:16,662
Will he be considered a culprit?

667
00:46:17,964 --> 00:46:22,128
Such people, spy for other countries and work for them.

668
00:46:22,936 --> 00:46:26,235
What is the guarantee that he will be loyal...

669
00:46:26,339 --> 00:46:28,807
...to the Indian Armed forces. As he is of now.

670
00:46:31,111 --> 00:46:33,909
Yes sir, I had called because we wanted our man...

671
00:46:34,014 --> 00:46:36,039
...in the Indian Army Headquarter, sir.

672
00:46:37,451 --> 00:46:42,047
Yes sir. The name is Subedar Ahmed.

673
00:46:43,490 --> 00:46:44,980
He is a Shia Muslim.

674
00:46:46,426 --> 00:46:50,419
Yes sir. The problem is that he is one of them.

675
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:54,460
Yes sir.

676
00:46:56,670 --> 00:46:59,161
It means that we have to declare one of them alive, sir.

677
00:47:00,674 --> 00:47:02,232
Yes sir, the man is very useful.

678
00:47:03,543 --> 00:47:04,976
Yes.

679
00:47:06,012 --> 00:47:07,104
That is what I am saying...

680
00:47:07,214 --> 00:47:08,374
...that we will try him for a year or two.

681
00:47:10,617 --> 00:47:13,245
I am giving the permission for the parade to disperse!

682
00:47:13,353 --> 00:47:15,651
Everything is going smoothly.

683
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:22,258
You will have to come where I have told you.

684
00:47:23,296 --> 00:47:25,264
Ok. Come.

685
00:47:27,701 --> 00:47:30,101
Whatever, Major Suraj Singh has said, is it true?

686
00:47:33,673 --> 00:47:35,106
Yes, sir.

687
00:47:35,942 --> 00:47:38,240
Then why don't you refuse this court-martial.

688
00:47:41,414 --> 00:47:43,644
It will be even difficult after reaching India.

689
00:47:45,685 --> 00:47:47,380
Major will not be there.

690
00:47:49,222 --> 00:47:50,416
And after reaching a common place...

691
00:47:50,524 --> 00:47:52,253
...all of them unite.

692
00:47:54,294 --> 00:47:56,125
You do not know what the condition there is.

693
00:47:57,230 --> 00:48:00,256
I am being taken out of one camp and sent to another camp.

694
00:48:04,137 --> 00:48:06,037
Can I be of any help?

695
00:48:09,342 --> 00:48:13,039
I mean to say that a way in which it will be very useful to you.

696
00:48:14,147 --> 00:48:16,581
Sir, free me from the court-martial.

697
00:48:17,284 --> 00:48:19,377
But this is a very minor job.

698
00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:21,978
Anything more than this.

699
00:48:22,355 --> 00:48:24,915
I mean you can stay with your family...

700
00:48:25,025 --> 00:48:27,255
...comfortably back in India.

701
00:48:28,295 --> 00:48:30,456
Something where you can have lots of money.

702
00:48:34,968 --> 00:48:36,560
I did not understand, sir.

703
00:48:45,612 --> 00:48:49,241
It is late in the night. We will talk later. Ok.

704
00:48:49,683 --> 00:48:50,980
Come.

705
00:48:51,952 --> 00:48:53,419
What happened!?

706
00:48:54,020 --> 00:48:55,248
Look there!

707
00:48:57,557 --> 00:48:58,990
What happened there?

708
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:02,255
Sir!
- Check it out!

709
00:49:06,366 --> 00:49:09,392
Sir, there was nothing. There must be an animal.

710
00:49:10,136 --> 00:49:11,569
Tell them to report to me!
- Yes sir!

711
00:49:11,671 --> 00:49:13,036
Go fast!

712
00:49:17,277 --> 00:49:18,437
Come.

713
00:49:20,413 --> 00:49:21,971
Come fast!

714
00:49:24,084 --> 00:49:26,052
I will come in minute.
- Ok sir.

715
00:49:30,423 --> 00:49:33,449
Ahmed had gained Karamat's confidence.

716
00:49:34,561 --> 00:49:36,927
He had given us the accessories...

717
00:49:37,030 --> 00:49:39,931
...required for the uniform, the belt and the medals...

718
00:49:40,033 --> 00:49:41,523
...one by one.

719
00:49:41,635 --> 00:49:42,602
Goltu, one more peg.

720
00:49:42,702 --> 00:49:47,901
And that evening Goltu made the jaggery drinks.

721
00:49:48,008 --> 00:49:50,101
Sir, one more peg.
- I love you.

722
00:49:50,477 --> 00:49:54,379
Sir one more.
- Best of 3.

723
00:49:57,417 --> 00:50:02,912
Sir. Sir. Sir.
- One more
- Sir. Sir.

724
00:50:03,023 --> 00:50:08,188
What is happening here?
- Hey Major Karamat.

725
00:50:10,030 --> 00:50:12,999
Make one drink for Major Karamt also.

726
00:50:13,099 --> 00:50:14,532
Got it sir.
- Got it sir.

727
00:50:14,634 --> 00:50:16,898
Both have done wonders.

728
00:50:17,003 --> 00:50:24,102
I will write a letter to both of you after reaching India.

729
00:50:24,411 --> 00:50:27,903
Take this sir.
- Have a drink Major.

730
00:50:28,014 --> 00:50:32,246
What is this? What is this?
- Sir jaggery...

731
00:50:33,353 --> 00:50:36,117
How did this happen? How did this happen?

732
00:50:36,489 --> 00:50:40,653
I do not know sir. They had made something with jaggery.

733
00:50:41,561 --> 00:50:46,396
Did you also drink?
- Goltu, one more.

734
00:50:46,499 --> 00:50:49,627
This is too much! This is too much!

735
00:50:50,336 --> 00:50:53,362
Come on!
- Sir! Sir!

736
00:50:54,107 --> 00:51:01,036
Major Karamat!
- Sir! 1... 2... 3...

737
00:52:03,409 --> 00:52:04,899
What about the photographs?

738
00:52:05,078 --> 00:52:06,568
I burned it, sir.

739
00:52:06,679 --> 00:52:08,044
I hope you have not burned the Colonel?

740
00:52:08,681 --> 00:52:10,512
He is sleeping like a log, sir.

741
00:52:10,950 --> 00:52:13,316
By now he must have reached Jodhpur and joined the duty.

742
00:52:13,419 --> 00:52:14,443
Shut up.

743
00:52:19,292 --> 00:52:20,452
Were you Hanuman in your last birth?

744
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:22,187
Sir, nowadays I am Vibhishan.

745
00:52:23,696 --> 00:52:25,664
What's the news?

746
00:52:26,366 --> 00:52:29,028
Sir, they have a flag hosting on 14th August in the morning.

747
00:52:29,536 --> 00:52:34,235
After that Sultana Khanan, a ghazal singer, is coming in the evening.

748
00:52:34,674 --> 00:52:38,303
Before that Colonel Shapoor and some ISI officers will arrive.

749
00:52:38,411 --> 00:52:45,044
And sir, all the new guards have riffles and mounted LMGs.

750
00:52:45,151 --> 00:52:47,415
All of it is American made. Advanced.

751
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:49,920
No burst can go wrong.

752
00:52:50,123 --> 00:52:51,988
And sir, there are three things in the signal room.

753
00:52:52,091 --> 00:52:56,585
Current, siren and along with the light, telephone main wiring.

754
00:52:57,230 --> 00:52:59,130
Just shutting it won't do, sir.

755
00:52:59,232 --> 00:53:01,063
We will have to damage it.

756
00:53:06,105 --> 00:53:07,436
Sir, I will have to see the phase.

757
00:53:08,007 --> 00:53:09,304
What about your bomb?

758
00:53:09,409 --> 00:53:11,036
Sir, we will have to save it from water.

759
00:53:11,678 --> 00:53:16,047
If water falls on the bomb... the bomb will go waste, sir.

760
00:53:16,950 --> 00:53:18,315
Anything else?

761
00:53:18,685 --> 00:53:20,243
Sir, we have received the order...

762
00:53:20,353 --> 00:53:21,980
...to vacate the camp within 15 days.

763
00:53:23,690 --> 00:53:26,921
It means after 15 days Red Cross won't be in Pakistan.

764
00:53:27,694 --> 00:53:31,061
On 14th August... Pakistan independence day.

765
00:53:31,698 --> 00:53:33,928
In the evening, there will be a feast. Kabir.

766
00:53:34,033 --> 00:53:35,466
I will look after the signal room, sir.

767
00:53:35,568 --> 00:53:36,557
Jacob.

768
00:53:36,669 --> 00:53:38,398
Sir, I will be around the fence.

769
00:53:38,504 --> 00:53:39,493
As soon as they receive the signal...

770
00:53:39,606 --> 00:53:40,595
...I will come near you.

771
00:53:40,707 --> 00:53:42,038
After leaving this place?

772
00:53:42,141 --> 00:53:45,907
Sir, Abudabad is 20 km from here in the south.

773
00:53:46,012 --> 00:53:49,243
If we get separated, then we all will meet there.

774
00:53:49,349 --> 00:53:50,509
After leaving this place?

775
00:53:50,617 --> 00:53:52,380
Sir, we have to follow the outside road.

776
00:53:52,485 --> 00:53:53,975
The first city is there.

777
00:53:54,087 --> 00:53:58,046
Fine. We will think of the next plan of action there.

778
00:53:58,958 --> 00:54:03,190
Remember. We have only one bomb as ammunition.

779
00:54:03,696 --> 00:54:06,597
If that is ruined, then everything is over.

780
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:09,065
Okay?

781
00:54:11,004 --> 00:54:13,029
Have faith in God.

782
00:54:13,673 --> 00:54:15,106
We are taking a chance.

783
00:54:15,541 --> 00:54:17,031
If we survive, then fine.

784
00:54:17,944 --> 00:54:22,040
Otherwise... we will die in the open air.

785
00:54:22,415 --> 00:54:24,906
If any one of us reach there...

786
00:54:25,018 --> 00:54:29,114
...then it will open the way of our freedom.

787
00:54:29,289 --> 00:54:30,449
Okay?

788
00:54:33,026 --> 00:54:35,256
There too. Here.

789
00:54:41,701 --> 00:54:43,566
There too.
- Okay, sir.

790
00:55:13,132 --> 00:55:16,033
Guards, attention.

791
00:55:16,336 --> 00:55:21,364
Guards, salute! Salute!

792
00:55:33,686 --> 00:55:35,085
This uniform is not of the right size.

793
00:55:35,288 --> 00:55:37,188
Didn't find one of my size?

794
00:55:37,290 --> 00:55:40,919
Parade, attention!

795
00:55:41,961 --> 00:55:43,121
Ram, Gotu!
- Sir.

796
00:55:43,229 --> 00:55:44,423
We will report on time!

797
00:55:44,530 --> 00:55:45,997
We will meet you after the program.

798
00:55:46,099 --> 00:55:47,396
The position will be army jeeps.

799
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:48,933
And you?
- Sir, I will look after the kitchen.

800
00:55:49,002 --> 00:55:50,401
After constable Ahmed take the position...

801
00:55:50,503 --> 00:55:52,232
...my position will be the signal room, sir.

802
00:55:55,408 --> 00:55:58,377
Guards, attention.

803
00:55:58,678 --> 00:56:00,976
Jacob.
- Sir, I will be with you.

804
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:02,411
I will move after Kabir takes the action.

805
00:56:02,515 --> 00:56:03,982
The target will be his.

806
00:56:04,083 --> 00:56:05,243
Ahmed.

807
00:56:05,351 --> 00:56:07,251
Sir, 2 minutes after the program begins...

808
00:56:07,353 --> 00:56:09,116
...the first blast will be the signal for Captain Kabir.

809
00:56:09,622 --> 00:56:11,590
After I go in, Captain Jacob will start the action.

810
00:56:11,691 --> 00:56:13,921
From a distance Captain Kabir will...

811
00:56:14,027 --> 00:56:16,052
...have to be alert and take the position.

812
00:56:24,537 --> 00:56:27,404
Parade, be alert.

813
00:56:27,940 --> 00:56:30,033
The shirt should not be seen. Come on, boys.

814
00:56:36,349 --> 00:56:38,579
I want the permission to start the program.

815
00:56:38,684 --> 00:56:39,981
Go ahead.

816
00:56:40,353 --> 00:56:41,445
Thank you, sir.

817
00:56:43,222 --> 00:56:45,452
On the auspicious day of Pakistan's Independence Day...

818
00:56:45,558 --> 00:56:47,048
...I welcome you all.

819
00:56:48,027 --> 00:56:51,929
I want to thank renowned Sultana Khanan...

820
00:56:52,031 --> 00:56:55,057
...who is well known for Pakistani ghazal.

821
00:56:55,168 --> 00:56:57,432
She took out some moments from her precious time.

822
00:56:58,104 --> 00:57:00,038
And she came here.

823
00:57:00,540 --> 00:57:04,567
So let's hear that singer who took Pakistani ghazal to great heights.

824
00:57:05,144 --> 00:57:07,578
Here comes Sultana Khanan.

825
00:57:26,165 --> 00:57:31,398
"Beloved..."

826
00:57:31,504 --> 00:57:35,031
"Beloved..."

827
00:57:36,676 --> 00:57:41,113
"Beloved..."

828
00:57:42,448 --> 00:57:46,384
"Beloved..."

829
00:57:48,421 --> 00:57:50,412
"Return home, beloved."

830
00:57:50,523 --> 00:57:52,650
"Put some fire."

831
00:57:52,758 --> 00:57:54,919
"Return home, beloved."

832
00:57:55,027 --> 00:57:56,995
"Put some fire."

833
00:57:57,096 --> 00:57:59,326
"The way you made me crave, earlier."

834
00:57:59,432 --> 00:58:01,400
"Do it again."

835
00:58:01,501 --> 00:58:03,594
"Return home, beloved."

836
00:58:03,703 --> 00:58:06,035
"Beloved..."

837
00:58:08,608 --> 00:58:10,906
Where are you going?
- To the bathroom.
- Major sir...

838
00:58:17,683 --> 00:58:20,982
"I have one God."

839
00:58:21,954 --> 00:58:25,253
"You have one God."

840
00:58:26,125 --> 00:58:33,054
"Then, my beloved, why are you angry."

841
00:58:34,033 --> 00:58:42,031
"Then, my beloved, why are you angry."

842
00:58:43,342 --> 00:58:52,046
"Beloved..."

843
00:58:53,953 --> 00:58:56,080
"Return home, beloved."

844
00:58:56,189 --> 00:58:58,316
"Put some fire."

845
00:58:58,424 --> 00:59:00,585
"Return home, beloved."

846
00:59:00,693 --> 00:59:02,661
"Put some fire."

847
00:59:02,762 --> 00:59:04,923
"Why are these separations there?"

848
00:59:05,031 --> 00:59:07,056
"Show some pity."

849
00:59:07,166 --> 00:59:09,157
"Beloved..."

850
00:59:09,268 --> 00:59:10,565
Sir, this is the electricity board.

851
00:59:33,693 --> 00:59:41,122
"One is my life, and one life is yours."

852
00:59:42,935 --> 00:59:47,497
"One is my life, and one life is yours."

853
00:59:47,607 --> 00:59:49,074
What's the matter? What are you searching for?

854
00:59:49,475 --> 00:59:51,067
What are you doing?

855
00:59:51,177 --> 00:59:54,374
I can't find the storeroom's key.

856
00:59:57,149 --> 00:59:59,083
Ask them what you want.

857
00:59:59,185 --> 01:00:01,312
Keep quiet.

858
01:00:02,288 --> 01:00:03,448
Keep quiet.

859
01:00:10,029 --> 01:00:21,031
"In the hope that you will return."

860
01:00:21,474 --> 01:00:32,408
"I have been waiting for you."

861
01:00:33,686 --> 01:00:36,587
"Beloved..."

862
01:00:36,689 --> 01:00:39,419
"Beloved..."

863
01:00:39,525 --> 01:00:42,460
"Beloved..."

864
01:00:42,561 --> 01:00:46,930
"Beloved..."

865
01:00:52,004 --> 01:00:54,029
"Return home, beloved."

866
01:00:54,140 --> 01:00:56,301
"Put some fire."

867
01:00:56,409 --> 01:00:58,434
"Return home, beloved."

868
01:00:58,544 --> 01:01:00,637
"Put some fire."
- Ahmed!

869
01:01:00,746 --> 01:01:02,907
"The way you made me crave, earlier."

870
01:01:03,015 --> 01:01:06,246
"Do it again."
- The bomb failed!
- What!

871
01:01:09,355 --> 01:01:10,913
You stop Kabir, I will stop Sir...

872
01:01:11,023 --> 01:01:12,320
...otherwise it will be suicidal.

873
01:01:12,425 --> 01:01:13,983
"Beloved..."

874
01:01:14,360 --> 01:01:17,329
"Beloved..."

875
01:01:17,430 --> 01:01:19,990
Kabir sir! Sir!

876
01:01:31,544 --> 01:01:33,068
What happened to the electricity?

877
01:01:33,679 --> 01:01:35,408
It's a blast!

878
01:01:38,951 --> 01:01:40,248
Check the supply!

879
01:04:12,938 --> 01:04:14,405
2240! 2240! Over!

880
01:04:14,507 --> 01:04:16,441
2240! 2240!

881
01:04:16,542 --> 01:04:18,908
2240! I have been calling you for the past 20 minutes!

882
01:04:19,011 --> 01:04:20,376
Report your location! Over!

883
01:04:20,479 --> 01:04:22,379
I am moving towards Abudabad.

884
01:04:22,481 --> 01:04:23,914
Okay! Over!

885
01:04:24,016 --> 01:04:26,177
2240! Who else is there with you? Over!

886
01:04:26,285 --> 01:04:29,311
Sultana Khanan. And 4 of our officers.

887
01:04:29,421 --> 01:04:31,321
Go there and wait for my further orders.

888
01:04:31,423 --> 01:04:33,254
And if you see any military vehicles on the route...

889
01:04:33,359 --> 01:04:35,589
...send them to the camp.
- Over.

890
01:04:35,694 --> 01:04:38,663
Over.
- Our men are traveling in that vehicle.

891
01:04:46,272 --> 01:04:47,500
Stop the vehicle!
- Go to Mujirpur. This is the Highway.

892
01:04:47,606 --> 01:04:51,042
And Muzafarabad is there.

893
01:04:53,679 --> 01:04:55,408
Any other route to reach there?

894
01:05:01,954 --> 01:05:04,081
He will shoot and I won't stop him.

895
01:05:05,024 --> 01:05:07,458
There is a coarse road from here.

896
01:05:07,960 --> 01:05:09,325
It goes towards the left.

897
01:05:10,029 --> 01:05:11,587
Turn the jeep.

898
01:05:31,350 --> 01:05:32,578
Switch off the headlights.

899
01:05:34,486 --> 01:05:35,919
What happened?
- Sir, I won't be able to drive.

900
01:05:36,021 --> 01:05:37,648
The road ahead is very bad.

901
01:05:38,691 --> 01:05:41,125
Ram.
- Yes, sir.
- Hold this.

902
01:05:44,964 --> 01:05:46,261
Let's go.

903
01:05:48,367 --> 01:05:51,359
Now show the direction. And remember.

904
01:05:52,137 --> 01:05:53,570
We can use bloodshed.

905
01:05:53,672 --> 01:05:54,900
Jacob.
- Yes, sir.

906
01:05:55,007 --> 01:05:57,373
Study the map en route... in the torch light.

907
01:05:58,077 --> 01:05:59,408
Let's go.

908
01:06:08,954 --> 01:06:11,184
Sir, 6 people are missing. Along with Major Suraj.

909
01:06:11,290 --> 01:06:12,416
What!

910
01:06:18,631 --> 01:06:20,462
Hawk 1 to Tiger. Hawk 1 to Tiger.

911
01:06:20,566 --> 01:06:24,297
Major Bilal Malik. Receiving the signal. Pass the message over.

912
01:06:24,470 --> 01:06:27,303
Hawk 1! 6 prisoners have escaped towards Abudabad.

913
01:06:27,406 --> 01:06:28,498
They are wearing ordinary clothes.

914
01:06:28,607 --> 01:06:31,303
Carry out aerial search in Charlie x-ray area.

915
01:06:31,410 --> 01:06:34,311
6 km radius. And road going to Abudabad. Over!

916
01:06:34,413 --> 01:06:35,971
Yes, sir. I am going there.

917
01:06:36,081 --> 01:06:38,914
Sir, any previous record of these people? Over.

918
01:06:39,018 --> 01:06:40,042
What do you mean? Over.

919
01:06:40,152 --> 01:06:42,916
Sir, I mean to say are they smugglers, spies or murderers.

920
01:06:43,022 --> 01:06:45,252
Who are they, sir? Over.
- How does that matter? Over!

921
01:06:45,357 --> 01:06:47,917
Sir, I mean to say if we got their photos and records...

922
01:06:48,027 --> 01:06:50,257
...then we can display it in the next check post...

923
01:06:50,362 --> 01:06:52,330
...and in all the newspapers. Over!

924
01:06:52,431 --> 01:06:54,592
Hawk 1, just do what you are being told to do!

925
01:06:54,700 --> 01:06:57,032
All right! All right! Thank you very much, sir. Over and out, sir.

926
01:06:58,937 --> 01:07:00,234
Stay alert.

927
01:07:01,607 --> 01:07:04,303
There is not much distance between them and us.

928
01:07:12,951 --> 01:07:17,047
How did all this happen? I want the full information.

929
01:07:17,156 --> 01:07:19,590
I am telling you, colonel. We don't know anything.

930
01:07:19,692 --> 01:07:21,387
Shut up, you scoundrel!

931
01:07:22,695 --> 01:07:24,060
Kayamat!
- Yes, sir.

932
01:07:24,163 --> 01:07:25,994
I want the full report!
- Okay, sir!

933
01:07:34,940 --> 01:07:36,908
Sir, I know that the jeep number is 2240...

934
01:07:37,009 --> 01:07:38,601
...and it has departed for Abudabad. Over!

935
01:07:38,711 --> 01:07:40,303
Then check Abudabad. Over!

936
01:07:40,412 --> 01:07:42,039
Sir, I have done that! It has not reached there!

937
01:07:42,147 --> 01:07:44,240
And if our men are in the jeep, then I don't want to take any risk!

938
01:07:44,349 --> 01:07:46,180
Over!
- So check the roads! Over!

939
01:07:46,285 --> 01:07:48,913
Sir, are they mad and foolish that they will escape by road!

940
01:07:49,021 --> 01:07:50,613
Do they want to commit suicide? Over.

941
01:07:50,723 --> 01:07:52,054
What do you mean! Over!

942
01:07:52,157 --> 01:07:54,091
Sir, they have gone by the jungle route.

943
01:07:54,193 --> 01:07:56,991
You do something there. I will leave right away! Over and out!

944
01:08:20,486 --> 01:08:22,044
Is this the highway?
- Yes.

945
01:08:22,955 --> 01:08:24,252
Get down.

946
01:08:24,356 --> 01:08:25,584
It is very dangerous.

947
01:08:25,691 --> 01:08:30,321
Nothing will happen! Don't act smart! Get down! Out!

948
01:08:30,562 --> 01:08:32,052
Hurry up!

949
01:08:34,500 --> 01:08:39,233
Come on! Hurry up! Give me the rope!

950
01:08:39,338 --> 01:08:40,965
We will have to make him unconscious!

951
01:08:50,682 --> 01:08:52,047
Hold him!

952
01:09:05,964 --> 01:09:07,261
Jacob! Are you fine!

953
01:09:10,002 --> 01:09:11,230
Sir, the bullet just missed me.

954
01:09:11,336 --> 01:09:13,395
Are you sure?
- Yes, sir.

955
01:09:14,339 --> 01:09:16,034
The blood is oozing out.

956
01:09:16,141 --> 01:09:18,234
Right! Keep the body in the jeep.

957
01:09:18,343 --> 01:09:19,640
And cover the jeep with the bushes.

958
01:09:20,012 --> 01:09:21,411
Take as much ammunition as you can carry.

959
01:09:21,947 --> 01:09:23,107
And their wallet too.

960
01:09:23,215 --> 01:09:24,307
Hurry up!

961
01:09:25,684 --> 01:09:28,448
And listen! Ram, Gotu... we will have to make them unconscious.

962
01:09:28,554 --> 01:09:31,045
Come on!
- I am sorry.
- Come on!

963
01:09:31,156 --> 01:09:33,056
We will have to make you unconscious for sometime.

964
01:09:33,959 --> 01:09:36,052
Are you Indian?

965
01:09:37,029 --> 01:09:38,257
Yes.

966
01:09:40,165 --> 01:09:41,996
Then what are you doing here?

967
01:09:43,335 --> 01:09:46,896
Look... the story is long and there is not enough time.

968
01:09:47,005 --> 01:09:48,302
I won't be able to tell you.

969
01:09:49,441 --> 01:09:51,068
Are you a soldier?

970
01:09:51,944 --> 01:09:54,970
Yes.
- From '71 war?

971
01:09:56,348 --> 01:09:57,440
Yes.

972
01:09:57,683 --> 01:10:01,585
I too have been the member of Pakistani human rights commission.

973
01:10:03,555 --> 01:10:05,921
For the past 4 months, news of Red cross raid...

974
01:10:06,024 --> 01:10:08,652
...was being published in the newspaper.

975
01:10:12,364 --> 01:10:14,264
I have a request.

976
01:10:14,700 --> 01:10:16,565
Please don't make me unconscious.

977
01:10:18,537 --> 01:10:19,970
Believe me, dear.

978
01:10:20,672 --> 01:10:23,573
Take some of trust from our country.

979
01:10:43,962 --> 01:10:46,260
The jeep will be caught within next 20 minutes.

980
01:10:50,269 --> 01:10:55,571
Ahmed. It was Ahmed.
- Ahmed.

981
01:11:00,345 --> 01:11:01,573
Yes, sir.

982
01:11:11,123 --> 01:11:16,060
I think... I think he is no more, sir.
