1
00:03:32,669 --> 00:03:34,102
Let the evil eye not fall on you.

2
00:03:34,171 --> 00:03:37,106
I wonder which Prince is
going to carry you away!

3
00:03:37,174 --> 00:03:38,766
Go, Mother.

4
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:55,590
Madam
- Yes Pichumani?

5
00:03:55,659 --> 00:03:57,286
Flowers.. fell from your hair!

6
00:03:57,361 --> 00:04:00,592
Oh! Give it to me.
- Let me do it myself!

7
00:04:15,512 --> 00:04:17,605
Ok. I should go now.

8
00:04:29,193 --> 00:04:30,455
Karthik..

9
00:04:30,527 --> 00:04:33,121
..start the music as
soon as Pichumani puts the..

10
00:04:33,197 --> 00:04:35,461
..flowers in her hair.

11
00:04:35,532 --> 00:04:36,590
Ready, sir.

12
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,793
Viji.
- I am ready, sir.

13
00:04:39,236 --> 00:04:41,101
The girl runs, Pichumani
is playing the flute..

14
00:04:41,171 --> 00:04:43,105
.. and until he calls for her..

15
00:04:43,173 --> 00:04:45,107
..and check out the special tone..

16
00:04:45,175 --> 00:04:46,540
..for the begging
bowl crashing down.

17
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:49,170
I shall rock it.
- Okay. Okay, take.

18
00:04:59,289 --> 00:05:01,120
Let the evil eye not fall on you.

19
00:05:01,191 --> 00:05:04,126
I wonder which Prince is
going to carry you away!

20
00:05:04,194 --> 00:05:05,354
Go, mother.

21
00:05:19,443 --> 00:05:22,276
Madam..
- Yes Pichumani?

22
00:05:22,346 --> 00:05:24,246
Flowers.. fell from your hair!

23
00:05:24,314 --> 00:05:27,306
Oh! Give it to me.
- Let me do it myself!

24
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,366
Ok.

25
00:05:51,441 --> 00:05:54,103
That sitar note you hit
when that Girl got shy..

26
00:05:54,178 --> 00:05:56,112
..gave me Goosebumps!
- Yes..

27
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:58,114
..as if you played for Benhur
and Brave heart before this!

28
00:05:58,182 --> 00:06:00,116
You have been doing the same
damn thing throughout the year.

29
00:06:00,184 --> 00:06:01,617
He may hear you!

30
00:06:02,186 --> 00:06:04,120
She is the landlord's daughter,
and he is just a beggar.

31
00:06:04,188 --> 00:06:07,589
Just putting flowers in her hair,
how can love find its way?

32
00:06:07,658 --> 00:06:09,182
He's a Hero! That's why..

33
00:06:09,259 --> 00:06:11,591
What if you and I did the same?
- Police will find their way!

34
00:06:13,463 --> 00:06:14,623
I pity these Landlord's
daughters in Tamil Cinema

35
00:06:14,698 --> 00:06:15,858
Why?

36
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,600
They all seem to find only
beggars to fall in love.

37
00:06:18,702 --> 00:06:20,795
Viji, are you ready?
- Okay sir, play.

38
00:06:43,126 --> 00:06:44,320
How is it?

39
00:06:44,394 --> 00:06:45,520
Beautiful.

40
00:06:45,596 --> 00:06:46,824
So calm and peaceful

41
00:06:47,531 --> 00:06:49,294
What are you doing?

42
00:06:51,468 --> 00:06:53,402
Uncle! Don't move

43
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:55,267
Enemies are attacking us

44
00:06:55,372 --> 00:06:56,498
Enemies?

45
00:06:59,176 --> 00:07:00,541
Viji.. what is this?

46
00:07:10,187 --> 00:07:12,621
We have a Terrorist
unit at our doorstep

47
00:07:12,689 --> 00:07:14,122
They are just children.

48
00:07:14,191 --> 00:07:15,317
It's so Beautiful and Calm again

49
00:07:18,562 --> 00:07:21,292
Excuse me, where is Flat no 17 B?

50
00:07:21,365 --> 00:07:23,128
That's unoccupied. Why
are you enquiring about it?

51
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,690
We are moving in there.

52
00:07:24,801 --> 00:07:28,100
I handle the Security
and Maintenance here

53
00:07:28,171 --> 00:07:31,402
In short, I have total control!

54
00:07:31,475 --> 00:07:33,102
My name is Karthik.

55
00:07:33,176 --> 00:07:34,609
This is Viji.

56
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:39,713
Straight this way.
Last block. First Floor.

57
00:07:41,184 --> 00:07:42,742
Hello, how are you? I am fine.

58
00:07:50,394 --> 00:07:52,589
Excuse me.. excuse me.

59
00:08:01,571 --> 00:08:02,868
Your kerchief.

60
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:08,100
It fell down.

61
00:08:09,179 --> 00:08:10,737
Thank you.
- What is it?

62
00:08:10,814 --> 00:08:12,338
Thank you.

63
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:14,179
Its all right!

64
00:08:24,294 --> 00:08:27,286
I just returned her Handkerchief.
Why is she getting so emotional?

65
00:08:30,467 --> 00:08:31,866
Why are you laughing?

66
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:34,100
Was just thinking..

67
00:08:34,171 --> 00:08:36,639
.. of you as Pichumani, and she
, the Landlord's Daughter!

68
00:09:01,798 --> 00:09:05,791
Its very important to be
friendly with the neighbours.

69
00:09:05,869 --> 00:09:07,097
Ring the Bell

70
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:10,264
V. Ananthakrishnan,
Chartered Accountant.

71
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:13,536
Yes.
- Hello, sir.

72
00:09:14,177 --> 00:09:17,112
We are your new neighbours.
- Please come in.. come.. come.

73
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:19,239
I am Ananthakrishnan.

74
00:09:19,316 --> 00:09:21,307
I am Karthik. He is Viji.

75
00:09:21,385 --> 00:09:22,647
Sit.. sit. Please be seated.

76
00:09:23,754 --> 00:09:29,784
I am the secretary of this
apartment. Janu. - I am coming.

77
00:09:37,467 --> 00:09:38,593
My wife Janu!

78
00:09:38,668 --> 00:09:41,262
Greetings. - Boiled Milk
from our house warming pooja.

79
00:09:41,371 --> 00:09:42,770
Our new neighbours!

80
00:09:47,511 --> 00:09:49,376
My son.
- His name is Arjun

81
00:09:52,182 --> 00:09:53,410
Where are you working?

82
00:09:53,483 --> 00:09:55,815
We are musicians. Keyboard Players.

83
00:09:56,186 --> 00:09:57,517
You play in stage shows.

84
00:09:57,587 --> 00:09:59,782
No. We are from the Film Industry.

85
00:09:59,856 --> 00:10:02,120
Heard of Music director Vidyasagar!

86
00:10:02,192 --> 00:10:03,318
Yes!

87
00:10:03,393 --> 00:10:05,122
We play for his songs

88
00:10:05,195 --> 00:10:06,856
Songs from the movie Chandramukhi?

89
00:10:07,197 --> 00:10:08,323
Yes! We played those.

90
00:10:08,398 --> 00:10:12,095
Is it so? ' Can't you
speak for a while..'

91
00:10:12,202 --> 00:10:15,171
'..pampering me?'

92
00:10:15,238 --> 00:10:18,230
Oh I just love that song.

93
00:10:18,308 --> 00:10:20,776
You sing so beautifully.

94
00:10:21,178 --> 00:10:23,703
Thank you. Even our son
Arjun is learning the keyboard.

95
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:25,111
He is really interested in music.

96
00:10:25,182 --> 00:10:26,774
I can see that.

97
00:10:27,451 --> 00:10:30,113
If you could teach him music,
when you are free..

98
00:10:30,187 --> 00:10:31,518
Sure! With pleasure.

99
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:37,620
Seems like you cook well too
Just as beautifully as you sing.

100
00:10:37,694 --> 00:10:38,752
The aroma from the kitchen is great.

101
00:10:38,829 --> 00:10:40,126
If you don't mind,
could you give us some..

102
00:10:40,197 --> 00:10:42,358
Definitely! I'll bring it, as
soon as the cooking is over..

103
00:10:42,432 --> 00:10:44,764
Liking your apartment?

104
00:10:45,202 --> 00:10:46,464
Yes. Very much.

105
00:10:46,503 --> 00:10:47,561
When is your family arriving?

106
00:10:47,671 --> 00:10:49,662
They aren't coming.
I'm staying here alone.

107
00:10:49,773 --> 00:10:52,367
Mother's with brother in Delhi.
Viji stays with me on and off

108
00:10:53,276 --> 00:10:54,504
You aren't married?

109
00:10:54,578 --> 00:10:56,739
Not yet. He just
returned her Handkerchief.

110
00:10:58,448 --> 00:11:00,279
No, not yet.
- Not me either.

111
00:11:02,252 --> 00:11:03,446
You go inside.

112
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,612
You go inside, Janu.

113
00:11:08,191 --> 00:11:09,783
You mean, you are bachelors?

114
00:11:10,193 --> 00:11:12,593
We should be, since
we are not married..

115
00:11:13,196 --> 00:11:16,393
See Mr. Karthik, there has
been a mistake Some where..

116
00:11:16,466 --> 00:11:18,400
I think so too! In his Horoscope.

117
00:11:18,468 --> 00:11:20,095
According to our Apartment Rules..

118
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:23,105
..we don't allow
Bachelors to stay here!

119
00:11:23,173 --> 00:11:24,299
Why?

120
00:11:24,374 --> 00:11:26,103
There were 4 who stayed here..

121
00:11:26,176 --> 00:11:27,768
..created too many problems.

122
00:11:27,844 --> 00:11:29,778
Since then we don't
allow any bachelors.

123
00:11:29,846 --> 00:11:31,108
We had sent all house
owners a notice on this.

124
00:11:31,181 --> 00:11:33,115
But our house owner
lives in South Africa

125
00:11:33,183 --> 00:11:34,309
I know

126
00:11:34,384 --> 00:11:36,181
That is why we sent him an email!

127
00:11:36,253 --> 00:11:38,517
I assure you we aren't
those kind of Bachelors.

128
00:11:38,588 --> 00:11:40,715
We are the more decent ones
like Abdul Kalam and Vajpayee.

129
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:42,121
You won't even notice us here.

130
00:11:42,192 --> 00:11:44,126
We leave home early
and come back late.

131
00:11:44,194 --> 00:11:46,662
We've paid an advance of Rs. 2 Lacs.

132
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:49,198
Sorry. Isn't there
something called Rules?

133
00:11:49,232 --> 00:11:51,097
Its better you look elsewhere.

134
00:11:51,201 --> 00:11:53,101
Let's not discuss this now

135
00:11:53,169 --> 00:11:55,399
We'll have a word with the
house owner and get back to you.

136
00:11:55,472 --> 00:11:56,769
Come on, Viji.

137
00:11:59,442 --> 00:12:00,704
Where are you going?

138
00:12:00,777 --> 00:12:02,108
That Vessel is ours!

139
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:06,648
Drink lots of Milk! You
will be the next Dhoni.

140
00:12:09,452 --> 00:12:11,750
It's difficult for
bachelors to find a flat.

141
00:12:11,821 --> 00:12:13,118
Thinking practically there
seems to be only one solution.

142
00:12:13,189 --> 00:12:15,123
And that is..
- What for that?

143
00:12:15,191 --> 00:12:16,317
You getting married.

144
00:12:16,393 --> 00:12:17,690
It's also your mother's dream

145
00:12:17,761 --> 00:12:19,126
Your mother's as well.
Why don't you get married?

146
00:12:19,195 --> 00:12:22,187
As a bachelor they
won't give you a Flat!

147
00:12:22,232 --> 00:12:24,223
As a bachelor they
won't even give me a girl!

148
00:12:24,301 --> 00:12:26,496
Shut up, Viji.
- I am serious.

149
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:29,505
That Secretary chap.. even
he found himself a Girl.

150
00:12:29,573 --> 00:12:31,097
Tell your mom to find you a girl.

151
00:12:31,174 --> 00:12:33,108
One doesn't get married like that !

152
00:12:33,176 --> 00:12:35,110
It has to happen on its own.

153
00:12:35,178 --> 00:12:36,509
What?

154
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:40,408
First I should see
the girl of my dreams.

155
00:12:40,483 --> 00:12:42,110
When I see her I will know that..

156
00:12:42,185 --> 00:12:43,652
.. I can spend the
rest of my life with her.

157
00:12:45,388 --> 00:12:46,446
What?

158
00:12:46,523 --> 00:12:47,581
You are making me teary eyed!

159
00:12:47,657 --> 00:12:48,715
Don't pull my leg

160
00:12:48,792 --> 00:12:50,282
How will you know she is the one?

161
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,452
That's how it is.

162
00:12:51,528 --> 00:12:54,122
Like in Comic Books, there'll be
a Bulb glowing over your head..

163
00:12:54,197 --> 00:12:55,664
.. ringing of bells ..

164
00:12:55,732 --> 00:12:57,097
For that you should be an
Electrician or a Bell Boy!

165
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,100
Such things don't happen.

166
00:12:59,202 --> 00:13:00,260
They will.

167
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:02,463
What to do with the
Secretary till then.

168
00:13:02,505 --> 00:13:04,735
Before your bulb glows, he'll
pull the Fuse. - Let him be.

169
00:13:04,808 --> 00:13:08,107
Talk of Romance, and
passions are ignited.

170
00:13:09,179 --> 00:13:12,273
Hasn't such a thought
ever occurred to you?

171
00:13:12,349 --> 00:13:16,115
You mean, with Bells ringing
and Bulbs glowing. Actually, I..

172
00:13:16,186 --> 00:13:18,347
Better you keep quiet.

173
00:13:19,255 --> 00:13:20,517
Whatever!

174
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:22,114
Let the bloody tomatoes rot!

175
00:13:22,192 --> 00:13:24,126
How dare you avoid me!

176
00:13:24,194 --> 00:13:26,321
I will kill you.

177
00:13:26,396 --> 00:13:29,729
Leave me alone. You drunk rascal.

178
00:13:29,799 --> 00:13:32,199
I'm a man. I'll do as I please.

179
00:13:32,235 --> 00:13:35,102
What kind of a man are you.
Can't take care of your wife!

180
00:13:35,171 --> 00:13:36,661
How dare you question me!

181
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:39,106
Remove your nose
ring and give it to me?

182
00:13:39,175 --> 00:13:40,506
I'll kill you

183
00:13:40,577 --> 00:13:42,101
Give me the money!

184
00:13:42,178 --> 00:13:44,112
I know it's in your saree.

185
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:47,115
Don't be impertinent
to the man you belong to

186
00:13:47,183 --> 00:13:48,707
Don't hit me!

187
00:13:55,358 --> 00:13:57,292
Who are you? Holding my hand!

188
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:02,127
Who do you think you are?
A Supercop? Leave me.

189
00:14:02,198 --> 00:14:07,101
I will do as I please with my wife.
Nobody around dare ask me.

190
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:10,105
I'll let you go, as you're a woman.

191
00:14:10,173 --> 00:14:12,107
If a man had hit me..

192
00:14:12,175 --> 00:14:14,405
..that would've been the end.

193
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,773
You dare hit me? Do you know who..!

194
00:14:19,449 --> 00:14:22,111
Stop staring. Help me

195
00:14:22,185 --> 00:14:24,779
Oh God! Am seeing Double.

196
00:15:09,466 --> 00:15:12,196
You hired her to
beat me up, didn't you!

197
00:15:19,676 --> 00:15:21,109
Instead of telling me all this..

198
00:15:21,177 --> 00:15:23,111
..why don't you ask her straight..

199
00:15:23,179 --> 00:15:25,477
..the Bulb glowed, Bell rang,
when can we get married?

200
00:15:25,548 --> 00:15:27,482
She left in the
auto before I could..

201
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:30,314
What a woman she was. So Brave!

202
00:15:30,386 --> 00:15:32,854
Just like my mother.

203
00:15:33,189 --> 00:15:34,451
You mean she was an old woman!

204
00:15:34,524 --> 00:15:36,116
I meant like my mother.

205
00:15:36,192 --> 00:15:39,184
My mother is just like that.

206
00:15:39,262 --> 00:15:41,127
Once, this guy stole her handbag..

207
00:15:41,197 --> 00:15:45,190
..you should have seen her
beat him up on the road.

208
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:48,102
Even I was scared to touch
that handbag after that!

209
00:15:48,171 --> 00:15:49,297
I get it!

210
00:15:49,372 --> 00:15:51,101
Scoring music for
too many action films..

211
00:15:51,174 --> 00:15:52,300
.. has messed you up.

212
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:54,172
Who could she be?

213
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:56,576
Well she could be..

214
00:15:56,646 --> 00:15:58,841
Never mind! Don't say anything..

215
00:15:59,449 --> 00:16:00,780
Whatever!

216
00:16:32,248 --> 00:16:35,115
''The twilight sky in woman's
form walks on the earth..''

217
00:16:35,185 --> 00:16:39,713
''My heart stopped beating
with a glance she killed me..''

218
00:16:40,423 --> 00:16:43,449
''Like electric lightning she
struck through the streets''

219
00:16:43,526 --> 00:16:47,860
''My eyes are scorched..
My soul is torched..''

220
00:16:48,431 --> 00:16:51,457
''Who is she.. No one knows..''

221
00:16:51,501 --> 00:16:56,461
''Without giving me time to speak..

222
00:16:56,506 --> 00:17:00,465
..She disappeared
through the streets''

223
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:14,616
''The twilight sky in woman's
form walks on the earth..''

224
00:17:14,691 --> 00:17:17,455
''My heart stopped beating
with a glance she killed me..''

225
00:17:17,527 --> 00:17:20,462
''Like electric lightning she
struck through the streets''

226
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:25,399
''My eyes are scorched..
My soul is torched..''

227
00:17:47,523 --> 00:17:52,551
''Who is she.. A
descendant of the warrior Queen?''

228
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:03,397
''Who is she.. A
descendant of Kannagi?''

229
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:11,609
''Is she a descendant
of the poet Bharati''

230
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:16,284
''Or the daughter born to
the sun and the moon..''

231
00:18:16,352 --> 00:18:18,411
''An intoxicating Jasmine''

232
00:18:18,488 --> 00:18:23,824
''A lotus with thorns
A scorching beauty''

233
00:18:25,428 --> 00:18:29,421
''A computer
engineer A Karate expert''

234
00:18:29,499 --> 00:18:31,694
''A lyrical angel..''

235
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:35,803
''Find out and tell me..''

236
00:18:43,746 --> 00:18:46,442
''The twilight sky in woman's
form walks on the earth..''

237
00:18:46,516 --> 00:18:51,544
''My heart stopped beating
with a glance she killed me..''

238
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:12,708
''If I see her, I'll ask her
name and attach mine behind hers''

239
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:22,680
''If I hear her, I will
compose music for her words''

240
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:30,457
''Adding poetry to her speech''

241
00:19:30,526 --> 00:19:35,725
''Adding love to her lines''

242
00:19:35,798 --> 00:19:38,460
''Mesmerizing her with words''

243
00:19:38,501 --> 00:19:40,264
''Capturing her with humor''

244
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:44,397
''Unawares I will touch her heart''

245
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:46,374
''Adding a pinch of shyness''

246
00:19:46,442 --> 00:19:48,501
''With an abundance of happiness''

247
00:19:48,578 --> 00:19:52,412
''I will make her say she loves me''

248
00:19:53,516 --> 00:19:56,451
''Our glances will
mingle completely..''

249
00:20:03,693 --> 00:20:06,457
''The twilight sky in woman's
form walks on the earth..''

250

''Who is she.. No one knows..''

254
00:20:24,247 --> 00:20:28,650
''Without giving me time to speak..

255
00:20:28,718 --> 00:20:32,518
She disappeared through the streets''

256
00:20:51,674 --> 00:20:53,107
I somehow don't think
Beethoven's birthday..

257
00:20:53,176 --> 00:20:55,110
.. is cause enough for us to booze!

258
00:20:55,178 --> 00:20:56,406
What?

259
00:20:56,479 --> 00:20:59,676
He's a musician. We must
celebrate his birthday.

260
00:20:59,749 --> 00:21:02,183
It's not like we drink everyday..

261
00:21:02,251 --> 00:21:04,116
Last we drank was for
Michael Jackson's birthday!

262
00:21:04,187 --> 00:21:05,313
Which was last week!

263
00:21:05,388 --> 00:21:07,117
That's his problem.

264
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:08,851
I am done. Bill!

265
00:21:09,258 --> 00:21:13,388
Here.. finish the Chicken.

266
00:21:13,463 --> 00:21:15,522
There is too much Garlic in this.

267
00:21:15,598 --> 00:21:16,656
Karthik..

268
00:21:17,233 --> 00:21:19,292
Garlic is very good for health.

269
00:21:20,169 --> 00:21:23,104
If you have garlic everyday, one
in the morning and one at night..

270
00:21:23,172 --> 00:21:26,107
.. you'll live for a 100 years.
My grandpa used to say that.

271
00:21:26,175 --> 00:21:29,303
Not only did he say,
he lived it by example.

272
00:21:29,378 --> 00:21:30,436
Really?

273
00:21:30,513 --> 00:21:32,242
But the poor bugger died at 62!

274
00:21:32,315 --> 00:21:33,373
How?

275
00:21:33,449 --> 00:21:36,111
Well, he came out of bath,
dried his towel, sneezed. And died.

276
00:21:36,185 --> 00:21:38,779
But the Garlic..?

277
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:42,114
There are somethings in life..

278
00:21:42,191 --> 00:21:44,625
..which even Garlic can't save!

279
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,097
Can you believe this?
I am high on beer

280
00:21:52,201 --> 00:21:54,101
That's because you hardly ever drink

281
00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:57,401
So you ARE
suggesting I drink everyday?!

282
00:22:05,281 --> 00:22:07,613
Hello.
- Hello.

283
00:22:07,683 --> 00:22:09,116
I am Priti.

284
00:22:10,453 --> 00:22:11,579
I am Karthik.

285
00:22:11,654 --> 00:22:13,383
I am Inzamam-Ul-Haq.

286
00:22:14,257 --> 00:22:16,316
Can she not see me?

287
00:22:17,393 --> 00:22:19,361
I heard you are a Musician
- Yes

288
00:22:20,329 --> 00:22:23,127
I am also learning the Guitar

289
00:22:23,199 --> 00:22:25,099
If you ever drop your Kerchief..

290
00:22:25,201 --> 00:22:26,566
..on the guitar
he'll return it to you

291
00:22:26,669 --> 00:22:28,364
Can she still not see me?

292
00:22:28,471 --> 00:22:31,440
Let me not stop you. Good night.

293
00:22:31,507 --> 00:22:32,735
Good night.

294
00:22:38,281 --> 00:22:39,509
Wait.

295
00:22:42,385 --> 00:22:44,580
There, she bumped
into something! Let's go

296
00:22:44,654 --> 00:22:47,555
Why did you say you
are Inzamam-Ul-Haq?

297
00:22:48,191 --> 00:22:50,659
Would she have fallen in Love
with me if I said I was Viji?

298
00:22:59,702 --> 00:23:01,294
Noticed one thing about Beer?

299
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:04,669
Once drunk one even burps beer.

300
00:23:09,579 --> 00:23:10,841
Don't make noise

301
00:23:12,515 --> 00:23:14,107
Viji.. What are you doing?

302
00:23:14,183 --> 00:23:16,117
What is this? What is this,
Viji? He might come.

303
00:23:16,185 --> 00:23:17,311
It's the Secretary

304
00:23:17,386 --> 00:23:18,751
What are you doing?

305
00:23:21,591 --> 00:23:23,115
What's this? In front of
the Secretary's house?

306
00:23:23,192 --> 00:23:24,659
What if he comes..

307
00:23:25,461 --> 00:23:29,295
What is this? What's happening here?

308
00:23:30,399 --> 00:23:33,300
How dare you vomit outside my house?

309
00:23:33,369 --> 00:23:36,167
It's not what you're thinking.
It's his birthday.

310
00:23:36,239 --> 00:23:37,297
Happy Birthday, sir.

311
00:23:37,373 --> 00:23:38,567
So? If it's your birthday..

312
00:23:38,641 --> 00:23:40,108
..you will puke
outside everybody's house?

313
00:23:40,176 --> 00:23:41,438
I never puked on my last birthday.

314
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:42,568
Are you joking?

315
00:23:42,645 --> 00:23:43,703
Know who I am?

316
00:23:43,779 --> 00:23:45,110
Secretary of this apartment.

317
00:23:45,181 --> 00:23:47,376
Just a minute, sir.

318
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:48,508
What's he saying?

319
00:23:48,584 --> 00:23:50,381
Viji.
- Let me talk to him

320
00:23:50,453 --> 00:23:52,819
No need for that.
- I will talk to him.

321
00:23:53,189 --> 00:23:57,785
If you want to vomit
go to the bathroom

322
00:23:58,461 --> 00:24:01,123
Do we have Garlic at home?

323
00:24:01,197 --> 00:24:02,858
Viji, get in.

324
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:07,100
Just that he had some Beer.

325
00:24:07,169 --> 00:24:09,103
It didn't quite agree with him

326
00:24:09,171 --> 00:24:10,832
Trying to fool me?

327
00:24:11,173 --> 00:24:12,663
That's why we don't allow Bachelors.

328
00:24:12,742 --> 00:24:14,710
I'll have this cleaned in 5 minutes

329
00:24:14,777 --> 00:24:17,109
Think of this as a bad Vomit,
I mean, a bad Dream!

330
00:24:17,179 --> 00:24:18,612
What?

331
00:24:18,681 --> 00:24:21,275
What are you doing here again?

332
00:24:25,354 --> 00:24:28,118
Actually he seems to be
puking more than he even drank!

333
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:30,454
This is the limit.
Yes, this is the limit.

334
00:24:30,526 --> 00:24:32,426
I'll call the police.

335
00:24:32,495 --> 00:24:34,122
Why Police?

336
00:24:34,196 --> 00:24:36,357
Want us to vacate? We will vacate.

337
00:24:36,432 --> 00:24:38,093
Just give us a little time.
- How long? Half an hour?

338
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,225
We've to find another house
- 1 hour?

339
00:24:40,303 --> 00:24:41,861
Sir.. please.
- How much time do you want?

340
00:24:43,172 --> 00:24:44,400
How about 2 years?

341
00:24:44,473 --> 00:24:45,770
Would that be enough?

342
00:24:45,841 --> 00:24:48,173
Take 5 years. I'll call the police.

343
00:24:48,244 --> 00:24:50,178
Janu, get my cell phone.

344
00:24:50,246 --> 00:24:52,305
We'll vacate immediately sir.

345
00:24:52,381 --> 00:24:54,110
We'll look for
another house right away.

346
00:24:54,183 --> 00:24:55,707
Go. Get going.

347
00:24:55,785 --> 00:24:57,810
I'll call the police.
- What's that noise there?

348
00:24:58,454 --> 00:25:00,319
Nothing! Don't come out..

349
00:25:03,392 --> 00:25:05,656
You are not my Friend.
Just my screwed up Fate!

350
00:25:12,501 --> 00:25:14,230
Didn't I spell it out to you?

351
00:25:14,303 --> 00:25:15,668
If you want to puke
go to the bathroom.

352
00:25:15,771 --> 00:25:17,170
Why did you come out again?

353
00:25:17,239 --> 00:25:18,638
Wasn't that the bathroom?

354
00:25:18,708 --> 00:25:21,108
Which?
- Where I threw up?

355
00:25:21,177 --> 00:25:23,270
Hey.. hey.

356
00:25:23,346 --> 00:25:25,280
I was wondering..

357
00:25:25,348 --> 00:25:27,282
..what the Secretary was
doing in our bathroom.

358
00:25:29,251 --> 00:25:30,445
Sorry, Karthik.

359
00:25:30,519 --> 00:25:32,384
I will wash away my own sins

360
00:25:33,255 --> 00:25:35,450
What are you going to wash away?

361
00:25:35,524 --> 00:25:36,582
I sat all night
washing away your mess

362
00:25:36,659 --> 00:25:37,717
I am going to apologize
- What?

363
00:25:37,793 --> 00:25:40,125
I'll say that the Bird Flu
got me, will get some sympathy

364
00:25:40,196 --> 00:25:42,391
Not necessary.

365
00:25:42,465 --> 00:25:44,194
Have told him, we'll
vacate this place.

366
00:25:44,233 --> 00:25:46,098
That bad?
- He threatened to call the Police.

367
00:25:46,202 --> 00:25:48,227
Start looking for another house.

368
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:56,110
Leave this to me

369
00:25:56,178 --> 00:25:58,271
The way I beg for forgiveness..

370
00:25:58,347 --> 00:26:00,474
.. he is going to
come to you, and sob.

371
00:26:01,584 --> 00:26:04,109
Viji is going to the bathroom,
Having a bath..

372
00:26:04,186 --> 00:26:06,120
..Changing, meeting him and
finishing this once and for all.

373
00:26:06,188 --> 00:26:08,622
Wait and Watch what
happens in half an hour!

374
00:26:10,259 --> 00:26:11,385
Hey.

375
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:12,620
Karthik.

376
00:26:35,785 --> 00:26:40,188
''Is it the moon that I
see through my window?''

377
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:44,522
''Is she the one I lost on the road?''

378
00:26:44,593 --> 00:26:50,088
''What I saw, what I see..
Is it but a dream?''

379
00:26:50,199 --> 00:26:56,104
''Is it my muse
right in front of me?''

380
00:26:56,172 --> 00:27:02,600
''The dove that flew away
disappeared behind the clouds''

381
00:27:02,678 --> 00:27:12,246
''But when I came home and saw It
was in my garden tittering about''

382
00:27:12,321 --> 00:27:17,122
''She disappeared through the
streets but fate took me to her''

383
00:27:17,193 --> 00:27:21,653
''This makes me believe
That love has blossomed truly''

384
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:28,596
Good Morning.

385
00:27:29,572 --> 00:27:30,800
My name is Karthik.

386
00:27:31,173 --> 00:27:32,333
Newly moved in here.

387
00:27:32,408 --> 00:27:35,377
You may not know me, but I know you

388
00:27:35,444 --> 00:27:38,106
Remember last week, that
guy beating up his wife..

389
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:42,583
..you beat him up and threw him
into the garbage. It was amazing.

390
00:27:43,252 --> 00:27:45,516
Wanted your autograph right away

391
00:27:45,588 --> 00:27:47,647
Before I could cross
the road, you had gone

392
00:27:47,723 --> 00:27:50,123
Wanted to appreciate what you did

393
00:27:50,192 --> 00:27:52,456
As I said before, I am Karthik,

394
00:27:52,528 --> 00:27:53,586
May I know your name?

395
00:27:53,662 --> 00:27:54,720
Jnana Prakasham.

396
00:27:56,232 --> 00:27:57,494
Jnana Prakasham?

397
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,592
Professor Jnana Prakasham.
- Oh! Karthik.

398
00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:02,564
Where do you work?

399
00:28:02,671 --> 00:28:05,469
I am a musician. I work in Films

400
00:28:05,541 --> 00:28:06,599
Oh! Very good.

401
00:28:06,675 --> 00:28:09,269
I ardently listen
to Tamil Film songs.

402
00:28:09,345 --> 00:28:11,279
There's this latest song..

403
00:28:19,388 --> 00:28:20,446
It's a nice song.

404
00:28:20,523 --> 00:28:21,615
I like that song a lot

405
00:28:23,692 --> 00:28:25,319
I think it's based on Bhimplus raga.

406
00:28:25,394 --> 00:28:28,386
I also enjoy Tamil Movies.

407
00:28:28,464 --> 00:28:30,091
There's a new
director called Mani Ratnam.

408
00:28:30,199 --> 00:28:31,689
Brilliant boy.

409
00:28:31,767 --> 00:28:33,098
He'll become a great director.

410
00:28:33,168 --> 00:28:34,294
Mark my words.

411
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:36,235
He'll go places. Mr.
Raghavan, stop there.

412
00:28:38,173 --> 00:28:41,108
How can you ride
without your helmet?

413
00:28:41,176 --> 00:28:42,302
I forgot it in the office.

414
00:28:42,378 --> 00:28:43,504
No. The Police will surely catch you

415
00:28:43,579 --> 00:28:46,275
Even Chief Minister MGR has
said so in a recent interview.

416
00:28:47,583 --> 00:28:49,551
Got caught with the Professor?

417
00:28:49,618 --> 00:28:51,108
Who is he? Talks funny.

418
00:28:51,186 --> 00:28:53,711
He's a well read man
- Really?

419
00:28:53,789 --> 00:28:55,120
Didn't notice the bald head?

420
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:58,557
Was a Professor in a University.
Now is slightly mentally off.

421
00:28:58,627 --> 00:29:01,118
Thinks we are all
still in the year 1984.

422
00:29:01,196 --> 00:29:02,663
Why is that?

423
00:29:02,731 --> 00:29:04,699
Well that is because..

424
00:29:04,767 --> 00:29:06,098
Switch the motor off

425
00:29:06,201 --> 00:29:09,170
Am going to switch the motor off.
We'll talk in detail later.

426
00:29:09,238 --> 00:29:11,103
It's this way. Fengshui
is confusing everything..

427
00:29:11,173 --> 00:29:13,164
Going late to school?

428
00:29:13,242 --> 00:29:14,709
If you go late,
you'll miss your lessons.

429
00:29:14,777 --> 00:29:16,108
Then how will you
become a Great person?

430
00:29:16,178 --> 00:29:19,113
'The one who sleeps in
school misses Knowledge'..

431
00:29:19,181 --> 00:29:21,274
.. sang a great man

432
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:22,442
Mark my words.

433
00:29:22,518 --> 00:29:23,610
Discipline is a must.

434
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:50,740
Such loud music.. so
early in the morning?

435
00:29:50,813 --> 00:29:55,716
Nuisance!

436
00:29:57,386 --> 00:29:58,512
Hello..

437
00:30:03,258 --> 00:30:04,691
Anybody home?

438
00:30:57,513 --> 00:30:59,105
Please help. Something
has happened to him.

439
00:30:59,181 --> 00:31:00,375
What?

440
00:31:00,449 --> 00:31:03,111
Don't know. Something
seems to have frightened him.

441
00:31:03,185 --> 00:31:05,312
He is not responding

442
00:31:13,362 --> 00:31:14,454
He did this on purpose.

443
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:15,724
Who? What?

444
00:31:15,798 --> 00:31:18,289
Your friend. Why was he like that?

445
00:31:18,367 --> 00:31:19,595
Like what?

446
00:31:19,668 --> 00:31:22,102
I won't even look at the
face of someone I don't like

447
00:31:22,171 --> 00:31:24,833
And he made me..

448
00:31:26,241 --> 00:31:28,106
Please bring a hot cup of Tea.

449
00:31:28,177 --> 00:31:29,576
For me.

450
00:31:29,645 --> 00:31:32,273
What are you looking at? Its For me!

451
00:31:34,249 --> 00:31:35,443
Now tell me

452
00:31:35,517 --> 00:31:37,280
Leave that. When are you vacating?

453
00:31:37,352 --> 00:31:38,444
Vacate? What for?

454
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:41,318
Didn't you promise
to vacate last night?

455
00:31:41,390 --> 00:31:42,721
But I didn't even see you last night

456
00:31:42,791 --> 00:31:45,191
Didn't see at all? This is too much.

457
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:46,591
Last night after your friend puked..

458
00:31:46,662 --> 00:31:48,289
..didn't you say you would vacate?

459
00:31:48,363 --> 00:31:51,298
Last night we were in Singapore

460
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,095
Singapore?
- We came in only this morning.

461
00:31:53,168 --> 00:31:54,692
Can you prove it?

462
00:31:55,170 --> 00:31:56,694
Thousands come from
Singapore everyday..

463
00:31:56,772 --> 00:31:58,103
..are they all proving it?

464
00:31:58,173 --> 00:31:59,606
A Drunk's words cannot be trusted.

465
00:31:59,675 --> 00:32:01,643
For the last time,
When are you vacating?

466
00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:03,575
Don't you know the
rules of the apartment?

467
00:32:03,645 --> 00:32:05,442
Isn't this apartment
within the Indian Boundaries?

468
00:32:05,514 --> 00:32:08,108
In the Indian Penal Code
show me where it says..

469
00:32:08,183 --> 00:32:09,707
..Bachelors can't
stay in Apartments.

470
00:32:09,785 --> 00:32:11,116
I'll vacate immediately.

471
00:32:11,186 --> 00:32:13,552
I swear on Ambedkar.

472
00:32:16,391 --> 00:32:18,120
With all due respect..

473
00:32:18,193 --> 00:32:20,388
..I think you have
Multiple Personality Disorder.

474
00:32:20,462 --> 00:32:23,488
So calm outside, but
like a beast inside

475
00:32:23,599 --> 00:32:25,396
Consult a doctor immediately.

476
00:32:26,201 --> 00:32:28,465
What did you do to that man?

477
00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:30,629
I didn't DO anything on purpose!

478
00:32:30,706 --> 00:32:33,573
Tell me. No point
keeping it under covers.

479
00:32:34,243 --> 00:32:37,110
I should have kept it covered.
But before I could..

480
00:32:37,179 --> 00:32:38,373
What?

481
00:32:38,447 --> 00:32:41,314
He saw me Shame Shame puppy shame!

482
00:32:42,284 --> 00:32:44,514
Oh God! How did this happen?

483
00:32:44,586 --> 00:32:46,110
Well I came out of the shower
and was bathing in some music..

484
00:32:46,188 --> 00:32:48,452
..the tempo dropped
and so did my towel.

485
00:32:54,296 --> 00:32:58,665
This is the worst
punishment a man can get!

486
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:02,158
Get lost! Actually
why don't we vacate..

487
00:33:02,237 --> 00:33:04,102
Why should we vacate?

488
00:33:04,173 --> 00:33:07,438
You asked me to look
out for another house

489
00:33:07,509 --> 00:33:10,103
When you went to the bathroom,
I saw from the balcony.

490
00:33:10,179 --> 00:33:11,703
You also saw me?

491
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:13,680
No stupid. I saw my angel.

492
00:33:13,749 --> 00:33:14,807
Who?

493
00:33:15,184 --> 00:33:17,345
My Rani of Jhansi.

494
00:33:17,419 --> 00:33:18,545
Really?

495
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:21,111
She stays right here..
in our complex.

496
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:24,125
Even if the army comes to
evict me, I am not leaving!

497
00:33:24,193 --> 00:33:25,854
Then the Secretary?

498
00:33:26,195 --> 00:33:29,596
If you want, get even
and see his Puppy shame!

499
00:33:29,665 --> 00:33:31,462
Yuck! No!

500
00:33:40,375 --> 00:33:44,812
Good shot. Do you like
cricket, Babu? - Yes

501
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,609
Did you see the match last week?

502
00:33:47,583 --> 00:33:48,845
Which match?

503
00:33:49,284 --> 00:33:52,276
India Australia match. We lost
by 46 runs. Didn't you watch?

504
00:33:52,354 --> 00:33:54,481
Yes. I watched it.

505
00:33:54,556 --> 00:33:56,114
Hardly been a year since
we won the world cup..

506
00:33:56,191 --> 00:33:58,523
.. and they are losing so badly.

507
00:33:58,594 --> 00:33:59,652
It's a shame.

508
00:33:59,728 --> 00:34:02,288
Youngsters should
come into the team.

509
00:34:02,364 --> 00:34:03,592
Gavaskar should retire.
- Ah! You correct.

510
00:34:03,665 --> 00:34:06,099
There is this young
man from Hyderabad.

511
00:34:06,201 --> 00:34:07,293
Very brilliant player.

512
00:34:07,369 --> 00:34:09,269
Should play for India very soon.

513
00:34:09,371 --> 00:34:10,429
Mark my words.

514
00:34:10,505 --> 00:34:12,097
He'll be the captain of
Indian Cricket team one day.

515
00:34:12,174 --> 00:34:13,505
His name is..

516
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:20,548
Hello. Good Evening.

517
00:34:21,717 --> 00:34:24,185
The name of American
president is George Bush.

518
00:34:24,253 --> 00:34:26,346
British Prime
Minister's name is Tony Blair.

519
00:34:26,421 --> 00:34:28,582
Latest James Bond's
name is Daniel Greig.

520
00:34:28,657 --> 00:34:30,124
Why I am saying
all this is because..

521
00:34:30,192 --> 00:34:32,422
..I know the names of these
people from round the world.

522
00:34:32,494 --> 00:34:33,586
But staying in the same apartment..

523
00:34:33,662 --> 00:34:35,186
..shouldn't I know your name?

524
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:38,097
Azharuddin. The Hyderabad player..

525
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:41,363
..I mentioned, his name
is Mohammad Azharuddin.

526
00:34:41,470 --> 00:34:43,267
Very good player, Babu.

527
00:34:43,338 --> 00:34:44,669
He is a good fielder too.

528
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:48,301
Even recently he played very
well in the Ranji Trophy Finals.

529
00:34:48,377 --> 00:34:50,311
He is a very
promising player, you know.

530
00:34:50,379 --> 00:34:52,108
And who is there after Kapil Dev?

531
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:53,670
We need another genuine fast bowler.

532
00:34:53,749 --> 00:34:55,239
Even Madanlal has grown older now.

533
00:34:55,317 --> 00:34:57,683
Every now come here.
- What happened to the old lady?

534
00:34:59,254 --> 00:35:01,381
Sister, Grandma fell down.

535
00:35:01,456 --> 00:35:04,118
What happened?
- Nothing to worry, Babu.

536
00:35:04,192 --> 00:35:06,660
Might have been on empty stomach.

537
00:35:06,728 --> 00:35:08,662
Just take her to a doctor. Quick.

538
00:35:14,569 --> 00:35:18,300
Know any doctor? Or
should I go to a Hospital?

539
00:35:42,397 --> 00:35:44,092
Know Grandma's blood group?

540
00:36:14,529 --> 00:36:15,621
Patient's relative?

541
00:36:18,567 --> 00:36:19,693
Name of the Patient please.

542
00:36:22,371 --> 00:36:24,271
Please tell me the name.

543
00:36:26,708 --> 00:36:28,300
Why don't you just say it?

544
00:36:30,178 --> 00:36:32,612
What's your problem?
You're not answering

545
00:37:11,386 --> 00:37:12,512
I am sorry.

546
00:37:17,692 --> 00:37:20,490
Must have been fasting.
Nothing to worry about.

547
00:37:20,562 --> 00:37:23,588
Better to stay here tonight.

548
00:37:32,641 --> 00:37:35,109
Grandma.. She is alright..
Nothing to worry

549
00:37:35,177 --> 00:37:37,441
Better she stays here tonight.

550
00:37:51,193 --> 00:37:52,683
Oh! It's okay.

551
00:38:02,704 --> 00:38:07,505
''From the depth of her
eyes she spoke poetry''

552
00:38:08,243 --> 00:38:13,510
''With beautiful gestures
she communicated freely''

553
00:38:13,582 --> 00:38:19,248
''But through sounds she
can never speak to me''

554
00:38:26,194 --> 00:38:30,460
''Silence is not a handicap''

555
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:36,367
''Words do not mean true perfection''

556
00:38:36,471 --> 00:38:42,376
''Her face is enough for me
to speak language truly..''

557
00:39:02,697 --> 00:39:05,291
Sometimes God can be so Cruel.

558
00:39:07,502 --> 00:39:10,562
Let it be. Am sure your
bulb will glow elsewhere!

559
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:12,800
No, it's now burning brighter.

560
00:39:15,243 --> 00:39:18,110
When I first saw her I
wanted a girl like her..

561
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:20,740
.. now I've decided..
it's her I want.

562
00:39:22,517 --> 00:39:23,677
How?

563
00:39:24,719 --> 00:39:27,688
Think about it. You are a musician.

564
00:39:27,756 --> 00:39:30,316
You want to
accomplish something in music.

565
00:39:30,392 --> 00:39:32,121
I can understand..

566
00:39:32,194 --> 00:39:34,128
..if the woman in your life
doesn't understand music..

567
00:39:34,196 --> 00:39:36,391
.. but if she cant hear it even?

568
00:39:36,464 --> 00:39:38,193
Why should she hear it.

569
00:39:38,233 --> 00:39:42,670
You know that music
is felt, not heard.

570
00:39:42,771 --> 00:39:48,437
That's why music needs no language.
And neither does Love.

571
00:39:50,245 --> 00:39:53,112
When we score music for a film..

572
00:39:53,181 --> 00:39:57,311
..don't we leave portions
of the film with no music?

573
00:39:58,587 --> 00:40:02,114
Doesn't that silence
have so much beauty.

574
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:04,818
I can love her silence too.

575
00:40:09,364 --> 00:40:11,559
It doesn't mean that I
am giving her a life

576
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,568
I just want to share mine with her.

577
00:40:15,470 --> 00:40:17,301
I think we will be happy

578
00:40:21,676 --> 00:40:24,167
Be happy! So what are
you going to do next?

579
00:40:24,246 --> 00:40:28,114
I've collected details about
her. She is a school teacher.

580
00:40:28,183 --> 00:40:29,377
What?

581
00:40:29,451 --> 00:40:31,385
A school for people like her.

582
00:40:31,453 --> 00:40:34,479
She has a friend called Sheela.
Works in the same school.

583
00:40:34,556 --> 00:40:36,114
We should speak to her

584
00:40:36,191 --> 00:40:38,819
How will she talk?
- She can talk fine.

585
00:40:39,194 --> 00:40:42,652
If we meet her we can
find out more about Archana.

586
00:40:42,731 --> 00:40:47,168
You know you are lucky in Two ways!
- How?

587
00:40:47,235 --> 00:40:49,100
Your wife won't talk unnecessarily..

588
00:40:49,170 --> 00:40:51,695
..she won't bother if
you play rotten music.

589
00:40:52,507 --> 00:40:54,441
Where do we meet Sheela?

590
00:41:19,701 --> 00:41:20,759
Go and talk

591
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:33,672
She's gone

592
00:41:33,748 --> 00:41:35,443
Yes I can see that

593
00:41:38,286 --> 00:41:39,651
Stop her and talk

594
00:41:39,721 --> 00:41:41,245
What do I speak with her?

595
00:41:41,323 --> 00:41:43,120
Don't know if you've
starting trouble..

596
00:41:43,191 --> 00:41:44,317
..but I don't think her bike does!

597
00:41:44,392 --> 00:41:46,587
I'll stop her . You
think of something fast

598
00:41:46,661 --> 00:41:48,128
Hello. Hello, Madam..

599
00:41:48,196 --> 00:41:50,289
Excuse me, stop.. stop. Stop.
- Yes.

600
00:41:50,365 --> 00:41:52,230
License?
- Who are you?

601
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:54,495
CBI. - So, why do you
ask for the license?

602
00:41:54,569 --> 00:41:56,366
We can ask anything.
Got a license or not?

603
00:41:56,471 --> 00:41:58,803
How do I believe you're
from the CBI? - Good question.

604
00:41:59,374 --> 00:42:02,104
Let me walk away. Call
out CBI, I'll surely turn.

605
00:42:02,177 --> 00:42:03,838
Joking?

606
00:42:04,179 --> 00:42:07,171
I've been watching you. Is
this how you behave in a church?

607
00:42:07,248 --> 00:42:09,443
One second ma'am.
Sorry to trouble you

608
00:42:09,517 --> 00:42:11,610
Who are you?
- He is LIC. I mean CBI

609
00:42:11,686 --> 00:42:13,119
I'll call the police.

610
00:42:13,188 --> 00:42:14,314
It's not what you're thinking.

611
00:42:14,389 --> 00:42:15,515
I need to discuss something with you

612
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:17,317
What?

613
00:42:17,392 --> 00:42:19,451
About your friend Archana

614
00:42:20,195 --> 00:42:21,321
Archana?

615
00:42:24,599 --> 00:42:25,691
What about her?.

616
00:42:26,201 --> 00:42:29,102
There's a proposal for her.
Boy's name is Karthik

617
00:42:29,170 --> 00:42:32,105
Plays the keyboard. I'm a
great guy. He's even better!

618
00:42:32,173 --> 00:42:33,572
Who?

619
00:42:39,447 --> 00:42:40,607
Please don't misunderstand.

620
00:42:40,682 --> 00:42:42,741
I stay in the same place as Archana.

621
00:42:42,817 --> 00:42:44,114
When Archana's grandma
fell sick yesterday..

622
00:42:44,185 --> 00:42:46,380
..I was the one who
rushed her to the hospital.

623
00:42:48,189 --> 00:42:50,123
I need to talk to
you for ten minutes.

624
00:42:50,191 --> 00:42:51,818
Please.

625
00:42:55,730 --> 00:42:59,496
There are somethings in
life that make you wonder why.

626
00:42:59,601 --> 00:43:01,762
Archana is one of them.

627
00:43:03,238 --> 00:43:06,696
She was 3, when they found
out she had this defect.

628
00:43:06,775 --> 00:43:10,836
After that, her dad slowly
moved away from her and her mother.

629
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:15,115
Being a single
mother took its toll,..

630
00:43:15,183 --> 00:43:17,117
.. so, she never got the love..

631
00:43:17,185 --> 00:43:20,279
.. and affection a child
of her age should get.

632
00:43:21,189 --> 00:43:24,249
Then her father found another
woman and moved out completely.

633
00:43:24,325 --> 00:43:27,294
At the age of six
she lost her mother.

634
00:43:27,362 --> 00:43:31,093
From then, her
grandmother has been her everything

635
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:35,602
Watching her parents fight,
made her a violent child.

636
00:43:35,670 --> 00:43:39,538
She expects nothing from no one.

637
00:43:39,607 --> 00:43:41,097
She despises sympathy,..

638
00:43:41,176 --> 00:43:44,577
.. and expects
everyone to appreciate her.

639
00:43:44,646 --> 00:43:48,104
For that she studied well,
learnt to paint,..

640
00:43:48,183 --> 00:43:51,448
.. sculpt and even
learnt Karate and Kungfu.

641
00:43:51,519 --> 00:43:52,577
Yes I saw that

642
00:43:52,654 --> 00:43:54,121
If she starts hating something..

643
00:43:54,189 --> 00:43:56,680
..then it's difficult to
change her mind about it.

644
00:43:56,758 --> 00:44:00,626
And she generally feels
men are not to be trusted

645
00:44:00,695 --> 00:44:02,287
Come, let's go..

646
00:44:02,363 --> 00:44:03,455
No wait.

647
00:44:04,699 --> 00:44:09,659
I believe I can give her the love
she didn't get from her parents.

648
00:44:09,704 --> 00:44:13,367
Don't ask me why I
feel this, I don't know.

649
00:44:14,275 --> 00:44:16,368
I don't know you from before.

650
00:44:16,444 --> 00:44:20,107
But you are asking about
Archana in front of God,..

651
00:44:20,181 --> 00:44:22,479
.. I believe you will be true.

652
00:44:22,550 --> 00:44:25,542
Will she understand
when we speak with her?

653
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:28,521
If you see her face and talk,
she can read your lips

654
00:44:29,257 --> 00:44:31,851
Doesn't she have any other family?

655
00:44:32,193 --> 00:44:34,718
Her guardian. Mr Ananthakrishnan

656
00:44:34,796 --> 00:44:36,127
I have heard this name before

657
00:44:36,197 --> 00:44:38,097
Stays in the same apartment

658
00:44:38,199 --> 00:44:40,292
In fact he is the
apartment secretary

659
00:44:40,368 --> 00:44:42,563
Okay, bye.
- Yes, bye.

660
00:44:44,405 --> 00:44:47,101
Hey, Karthik.. usually Love
happens, then comes the villain..

661
00:44:47,175 --> 00:44:49,507
.. and with him, the problem.

662
00:44:49,577 --> 00:44:53,274
Here the problem is ready,
and the villain awaits us.

663
00:44:54,249 --> 00:44:56,342
Who next? Grandma?

664
00:44:57,452 --> 00:44:58,646
Coffee.

665
00:44:58,720 --> 00:44:59,846
Thanks.

666
00:45:02,457 --> 00:45:04,584
Sheela told me everything.

667
00:45:04,659 --> 00:45:07,594
But who is to tell Archana all this?

668
00:45:08,463 --> 00:45:10,192
Do you see that?

669
00:45:11,699 --> 00:45:13,098
There was one more Vase,
just like that.

670
00:45:13,167 --> 00:45:14,691
6 months back, I
spoke to her about..

671
00:45:14,769 --> 00:45:16,100
..getting married and she broke it.

672
00:45:16,170 --> 00:45:17,569
Really?

673
00:45:17,639 --> 00:45:20,164
You don't know about her anger.

674
00:45:20,241 --> 00:45:22,106
Sometime back, at the neighbour's..

675
00:45:22,176 --> 00:45:24,110
.. a young boy had
come from the army.

676
00:45:24,178 --> 00:45:27,306
He fell for her and said, I Love you

677
00:45:27,382 --> 00:45:29,111
She punched his nose in return..

678
00:45:29,183 --> 00:45:30,844
..and he went
running back, to Kashmir.

679
00:45:31,185 --> 00:45:32,311
Don't say a thing!

680
00:45:32,387 --> 00:45:34,685
But we can't just leave it, can we?

681
00:45:34,756 --> 00:45:36,451
Want to call him back from Kashmir?

682
00:45:36,524 --> 00:45:38,856
I mean we should be advising her

683
00:45:39,193 --> 00:45:40,524
What do you want me to do?

684
00:45:40,595 --> 00:45:41,823
I will handle it.

685
00:45:42,297 --> 00:45:44,492
All I need is your consent

686
00:45:44,599 --> 00:45:47,591
I was worried about her future

687
00:45:47,669 --> 00:45:50,832
I will be glad to
see her settle down.

688
00:45:51,239 --> 00:45:56,233
Your husband is
pestering us to vacate.

689
00:45:56,311 --> 00:45:58,108
Ignore him. You just go ahead

690
00:45:58,179 --> 00:46:01,842
Just make sure there are
no problems with him..

691
00:46:05,453 --> 00:46:07,284
All routes seem clear.

692
00:46:07,355 --> 00:46:09,550
The next person is the Secretary

693
00:46:09,624 --> 00:46:11,717
I must find a place in his heart

694
00:46:11,793 --> 00:46:14,626
Even Aunty failed there!
Where do you stand?

695
00:46:14,696 --> 00:46:16,664
Be serious. This is no time to joke.

696
00:46:16,698 --> 00:46:18,598
That Fat Cream Bun Arjun..

697
00:46:18,666 --> 00:46:20,759
Who?
- The Secretary's Fatso Son.

698
00:46:20,868 --> 00:46:22,096
I will teach him the keyboards and..

699
00:46:22,170 --> 00:46:24,604
.. make him a little Rehman,
within a month.

700
00:46:24,672 --> 00:46:27,368
Now you are joking.
- We have no choice.

701
00:46:27,442 --> 00:46:29,103
I'll go to the beach..

702
00:46:29,177 --> 00:46:30,838
..cry out my woes and
commit the sin. - All the best.

703
00:46:31,179 --> 00:46:32,441
Have to wake up at 5.30 am

704
00:46:32,513 --> 00:46:33,707
Delivering milk?

705
00:46:33,781 --> 00:46:36,272
No am going Jogging.
- What? Why?

706
00:46:36,351 --> 00:46:38,444
Archana goes jogging everyday.
- Alone?

707
00:46:38,519 --> 00:46:40,111
With her Dog.
- She won't need you then!

708
00:46:40,188 --> 00:46:41,655
Good night.

709
00:46:43,191 --> 00:46:45,125
Professor, this is too much.

710
00:46:45,193 --> 00:46:46,524
Did you say something?

711
00:46:46,594 --> 00:46:48,118
Who else to inform?
And you're sleeping ..

712
00:46:48,196 --> 00:46:49,322
What's your plan?

713
00:46:49,397 --> 00:46:50,455
What can I do?

714
00:46:50,498 --> 00:46:52,693
Mr. Ananthakrishnan..

715
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,097
You don't realize the
seriousness of the situation.

716
00:46:54,168 --> 00:46:55,863
The consequences could be very bad.

717
00:46:56,371 --> 00:46:58,362
You are the right man for this!
- What happened ?

718
00:46:58,439 --> 00:47:01,272
How can you act as
if you know nothing?

719
00:47:01,342 --> 00:47:03,606
MGR is unwell, has
been admitted in hospital

720
00:47:03,678 --> 00:47:05,270
What can I do? Am I a doctor?

721
00:47:05,346 --> 00:47:06,608
He doesn't even look educated.

722
00:47:06,681 --> 00:47:09,241
Educated in an MBBS I mean!

723
00:47:09,317 --> 00:47:11,114
See? How irresponsible he is

724
00:47:11,185 --> 00:47:12,482
Not like that.

725
00:47:12,553 --> 00:47:14,521
It is. MGR is a great leader.

726
00:47:14,589 --> 00:47:16,181
They suspect a Brain Tumour.

727
00:47:16,257 --> 00:47:18,122
If something happens..

728
00:47:18,192 --> 00:47:19,318
.. it will be a law & order problem.

729
00:47:19,394 --> 00:47:21,225
There won't be newspapers,
nor milk..

730
00:47:21,329 --> 00:47:23,126
I'll deliver milk in
your house. Happy?

731
00:47:23,197 --> 00:47:24,562
Even the newspaper.
- Did I ask you?

732
00:47:24,599 --> 00:47:26,464
Just supporting you
- Not necessary

733
00:47:26,567 --> 00:47:27,659
I have a helping nature.
That's why. - Shut up.

734
00:47:27,702 --> 00:47:31,229
Mr. Ananthakrishnan, You are
the secretary of this apartment.

735
00:47:31,305 --> 00:47:33,102
Instead of speaking of security..

736
00:47:33,174 --> 00:47:34,505
.. you are talking like a milk boy.

737
00:47:34,575 --> 00:47:36,099
Wait till the next election.

738
00:47:36,177 --> 00:47:37,439
We'll show you who we are.

739
00:47:37,512 --> 00:47:39,275
Mark my words. Your
days are numbered.

740
00:47:39,347 --> 00:47:41,110
Jnana Prakasham, you
are talking too much.

741
00:47:41,182 --> 00:47:43,116
No, you are talking too much.

742
00:47:43,184 --> 00:47:45,118
You shut up. Take him away.

743
00:47:45,186 --> 00:47:46,312
Call that security.

744
00:47:46,387 --> 00:47:48,116
Don't worry, sir. Look, I will..

745
00:47:48,189 --> 00:47:50,555
..support you. In the next election,

746
00:47:50,625 --> 00:47:53,116
at least by
casting ten false votes..

747
00:47:53,194 --> 00:47:55,458
..I shall make you win.
- Janu, go inside.

748
00:47:55,530 --> 00:47:57,088
Irresponsible idiot.
- Sir, nothing will happen to MGR.

749
00:47:57,198 --> 00:47:59,223
They'll take him to America.

750
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:01,097
His ministers will
also accompany him.

751
00:48:01,169 --> 00:48:03,569
He will also win the next election.

752
00:48:03,638 --> 00:48:05,538
How?
- His horoscope says so!

753
00:48:05,606 --> 00:48:07,301
See. He is answering me responsibly.

754
00:48:07,375 --> 00:48:11,641
Mark my words. He will
be the next secretary.

755
00:48:11,713 --> 00:48:14,375
Let that be for now.
Just go home and rest.

756
00:48:14,449 --> 00:48:16,747
Whether there's milk or not,
your coffee will taste the same!

757
00:48:18,586 --> 00:48:20,520
Thank you so much son..

758
00:48:20,588 --> 00:48:21,646
Its ok

759
00:48:21,723 --> 00:48:22,781
It's not that.

760
00:48:22,857 --> 00:48:25,758
Everybody is always making
fun of him and ridiculing him.

761
00:48:25,827 --> 00:48:28,694
You are the only one
who speaks to him kindly

762
00:48:29,530 --> 00:48:30,861
How did this happen to him?

763
00:48:33,501 --> 00:48:35,162
We had a son.

764
00:48:35,236 --> 00:48:38,637
He was in his 12th class,
when he met with an accident

765
00:48:44,512 --> 00:48:46,480
In 1984?

766
00:48:48,583 --> 00:48:50,107
As soon as we got the call..

767
00:48:50,184 --> 00:48:52,379
.. he was shocked and shaken.

768
00:48:52,453 --> 00:48:55,581
He doesn't know anything
that happened thereafter.

769
00:48:57,191 --> 00:48:58,715
He didn't even shed a tear.

770
00:48:58,793 --> 00:49:03,753
If he had broken down and cried,
this may not have happened.

771
00:49:05,466 --> 00:49:07,593
He never recovered from that shock.

772
00:49:08,169 --> 00:49:10,103
As far as he is concerned,..

773
00:49:10,171 --> 00:49:13,800
..this world came to a
stand still that day in 1984.

774
00:49:15,376 --> 00:49:17,276
Was your son's name Babu?

775
00:49:19,447 --> 00:49:21,506
That's what we called him

776
00:49:21,582 --> 00:49:23,607
Sir calls me Babu.

777
00:49:27,388 --> 00:49:31,324
If he had been alive, he
would have been like you.

778
00:50:07,228 --> 00:50:08,456
Oh! Good morning.

779
00:50:09,197 --> 00:50:10,459
How is grandma?

780
00:50:10,498 --> 00:50:11,658
Grandma?

781
00:50:17,238 --> 00:50:20,298
You are asking if I jog every day?

782
00:50:21,442 --> 00:50:25,674
Yes. Me, daily. 5
'o' clock.. jogging.

783
00:50:29,183 --> 00:50:32,641
Remember sometime back
there was floods in the city?

784
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:34,278
I jogged even then.

785
00:50:35,256 --> 00:50:36,587
Your dog.

786
00:50:38,693 --> 00:50:41,560
Your dog? Very cute.

787
00:50:41,629 --> 00:50:44,291
I love dogs.

788
00:50:45,499 --> 00:50:48,366
So sweet.. pupy dear.

789
00:50:55,610 --> 00:50:58,670
We want sixer.. we want sixer..

790
00:50:58,746 --> 00:51:02,273
We want sixer.. we want sixer..

791
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:05,615
We want sixer.. we want sixer.

792
00:51:05,686 --> 00:51:11,682
We want sixer.. we want sixer.

793
00:51:11,759 --> 00:51:14,626
Yeah!
- Ahh..h!

794
00:51:53,701 --> 00:51:58,229
Karthik, you went like a Hero
and came back like an Item Girl?

795
00:51:58,306 --> 00:52:00,274
Was showing
Archana's dog, my affection.

796
00:52:00,341 --> 00:52:01,740
He didn't return my feelings

797
00:52:01,809 --> 00:52:04,107
Heard you broke
athletic records in Chennai.

798
00:52:04,178 --> 00:52:05,304
Shut up!

799
00:52:05,379 --> 00:52:08,348
I heard from the
Apartment kids. Am proud of you!

800
00:52:09,250 --> 00:52:10,444
Didn't realize..

801
00:52:10,518 --> 00:52:12,645
..that a Giant Beast could
be within such a small Dog?!

802
00:52:14,588 --> 00:52:15,680
You?

803
00:52:19,193 --> 00:52:20,524
Hello aunty. How come
you've come here alone?

804
00:52:22,596 --> 00:52:23,654
What happened?

805
00:52:26,233 --> 00:52:27,598
It's ok. Control yourself.

806
00:52:30,571 --> 00:52:32,266
Whatever it is, tell me.

807
00:52:32,340 --> 00:52:33,398
But please in Tamil..

808
00:52:33,474 --> 00:52:34,532
.. since I don't know Chinese.

809
00:52:37,244 --> 00:52:38,370
What happened to your nose?

810
00:52:38,446 --> 00:52:39,572
Nose?

811
00:52:39,647 --> 00:52:42,172
Shut up, the stitches will come off

812
00:52:42,249 --> 00:52:44,183
Hello Doctor, how come you are here?

813
00:52:44,251 --> 00:52:46,185
Convey my regards to
every one at home.

814
00:53:31,499 --> 00:53:33,660
Viji, It hurts like crazy.

815
00:53:33,768 --> 00:53:36,362
Doctor poked me,
all around my navel.

816
00:53:36,470 --> 00:53:38,097
What did you expect?
Spin a top around it?

817
00:53:38,172 --> 00:53:39,298
Hi.

818
00:53:42,276 --> 00:53:44,369
I heard, a dog bit you?

819
00:53:45,346 --> 00:53:46,438
Even you know about it!

820
00:53:46,514 --> 00:53:48,675
Where did it bite you?

821
00:53:48,749 --> 00:53:50,410
Started in Adyar, then
it bit me in Besant Nagar

822
00:53:51,185 --> 00:53:52,777
Where did it bite you on your body?

823
00:53:54,255 --> 00:53:57,122
Nowhere in particular.
Everywhere in general.

824
00:53:57,191 --> 00:53:59,284
I want to see.

825
00:54:01,228 --> 00:54:03,128
Is this a national
heritage for public viewing?

826
00:54:03,197 --> 00:54:04,596
No college?

827
00:54:04,665 --> 00:54:05,689
I took leave today

828
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:08,462
Why?
- Didn't feel like going

829
00:54:11,672 --> 00:54:13,765
Can I stay and look after you?

830
00:54:13,841 --> 00:54:15,638
No need. Please leave me alone..

831
00:54:15,709 --> 00:54:17,802
Won't you understand my feelings?

832
00:54:18,512 --> 00:54:22,448
The doctor gave me heavy
injections, I feel dizzy.

833
00:54:22,516 --> 00:54:23,574
Need to rest. Do me a small favour?

834
00:54:23,651 --> 00:54:24,845
What is it?

835
00:54:25,252 --> 00:54:26,549
A small favour..

836
00:54:26,620 --> 00:54:28,815
Close the door on your way out.

837
00:54:43,504 --> 00:54:44,698
Won't you understand my feelings?

838
00:54:46,574 --> 00:54:47,734
What do I do with this girl?

839
00:54:47,808 --> 00:54:49,639
Be fair! She has the same disease.

840
00:54:49,710 --> 00:54:52,338
Looking at you all
her bulbs are glowing!

841
00:54:52,413 --> 00:54:55,439
You heard only one bell
but she heard a million

842
00:54:55,516 --> 00:54:57,643
She is back

843
00:54:57,718 --> 00:55:00,346
Must be someone else.
Tell them I am indisposed.

844
00:55:02,189 --> 00:55:04,123
How come I am
always invisible to her?

845
00:55:06,293 --> 00:55:07,453
Please come in.

846
00:55:18,672 --> 00:55:20,105
HI, please come in.. come.

847
00:55:20,174 --> 00:55:22,267
This is my friend Viji.

848
00:55:23,377 --> 00:55:28,280
I'm Sheela. Yes, I know that.
- Viji. Please sit down. Come.

849
00:55:35,523 --> 00:55:36,649
She says I'm sorry

850
00:55:36,724 --> 00:55:38,749
Apologizing for
such a trivial thing.

851
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:48,100
She says this dog
has never bitten anyone

852
00:55:48,169 --> 00:55:50,103
It was totally unexpected

853
00:55:50,171 --> 00:55:52,105
It's ok. It hardly bit me.

854
00:55:52,173 --> 00:55:54,641
Just a scratch here
and a minor peck there.

855
00:55:57,178 --> 00:55:59,612
Don't worry about me. Am
perfectly all right actually.

856
00:56:06,187 --> 00:56:07,313
She says your house..

857
00:56:07,388 --> 00:56:08,787
My house is very beautiful, right?

858
00:56:10,257 --> 00:56:12,589
Thank you. First
time you have come home.

859
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:14,321
Coffee.. coffee.

860
00:56:14,395 --> 00:56:16,420
No, we are late for school.

861
00:56:16,497 --> 00:56:19,295
You should come another
day for Coffee definitely.

862
00:56:21,268 --> 00:56:22,462
Okay.
- Okay bye.

863
00:56:25,172 --> 00:56:28,573
Get well soon.
- Oh! Thank you. Bye bye.

864
00:56:38,519 --> 00:56:39,611
I have a question.

865
00:56:39,687 --> 00:56:43,384
Archana said something
and Sheela explained it.

866
00:56:43,457 --> 00:56:46,426
Then you replied
and Sheela explained.

867
00:56:46,493 --> 00:56:47,858
I have a small doubt.

868
00:56:48,195 --> 00:56:50,288
Does this mean Sheela
will be with you forever?

869
00:56:52,399 --> 00:56:54,663
Nobody else can think from
such a strange perspective.

870
00:56:54,702 --> 00:56:56,101
But you are correct. I
will learn that as well.

871
00:56:56,170 --> 00:56:57,797
Learn what ?

872
00:56:58,505 --> 00:56:59,597
Sign language.

873
00:57:00,708 --> 00:57:02,835
A
- A

874
00:57:04,178 --> 00:57:07,636

D
- D

877
00:57:16,190 --> 00:57:19,284
E

878
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:20,452

879
00:57:20,527 --> 00:57:22,654
G
- G

880
00:57:29,236 --> 00:57:31,295
Viji.. Viji.

881
00:57:31,372 --> 00:57:32,430
What is it?

882
00:57:37,678 --> 00:57:39,703
Why are you pestering me?
What is your problem?

883
00:57:39,780 --> 00:57:41,611
I said your name is Viji

884
00:57:41,682 --> 00:57:43,115
Did I say, my name is Padayappa?

885
00:57:43,183 --> 00:57:44,309
I was practicing.

886
00:57:44,385 --> 00:57:45,443
Don't act so irresponsibly.

887
00:57:45,519 --> 00:57:47,248
Good Morning.
- Good morning.

888
00:57:47,321 --> 00:57:50,449
Good evening.
- Good evening.

889
00:57:50,524 --> 00:57:54,517
Good Night.
- Good Night.

890
00:57:55,396 --> 00:57:56,590
Thank you.

891
00:57:56,697 --> 00:57:58,289
Thank you.

892
00:58:00,234 --> 00:58:01,462
Just a minute.

893
00:58:04,171 --> 00:58:06,105
Don't misunderstand..

894
00:58:06,173 --> 00:58:07,299
..but how does one say 'I love you!'

895
00:58:11,245 --> 00:58:12,507
Viji.
- What?

896
00:58:14,682 --> 00:58:17,276
Arrested the Producer? Who
the hell is going to Pay us?

897
00:58:20,387 --> 00:58:22,855
Feeling cold? Why didn't you say so?

898
00:58:23,257 --> 00:58:24,622
I said 'I Love you'.

899
00:58:24,692 --> 00:58:26,125
I am just the person
who should hear that!

900
00:58:29,229 --> 00:58:30,491
Who is this?

901
00:58:33,233 --> 00:58:34,495
Grandma

902
00:58:36,470 --> 00:58:37,562
Grandpa?

903
00:58:38,372 --> 00:58:39,532
Grandpa

904
00:58:43,177 --> 00:58:44,303
Who is this?

905
00:58:51,585 --> 00:58:52,677
Means?

906
00:58:54,621 --> 00:58:55,815
My husband

907
00:59:13,374 --> 00:59:14,500
Are you serious?

908
00:59:15,743 --> 00:59:20,180
Yes. Died within a year of
their marriage in an accident.

909
00:59:22,282 --> 00:59:23,579
Was shocked when I heard it

910
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:30,121
Everyone seems to have a sad past
- the Professor..

911
00:59:30,190 --> 00:59:34,718
..Archana and now Sheela.
I guess that's how Life is.

912
00:59:35,696 --> 00:59:37,095
The other day at the hospital..

913
00:59:37,197 --> 00:59:40,098
..Archana explained
her condition to me..

914
00:59:40,167 --> 00:59:42,465
.. with so much
dignity and self respect.

915
00:59:42,503 --> 00:59:48,271
I could see her belief in
Life, beyond her handicap.

916
00:59:50,277 --> 00:59:52,108
Today I saw the
same thing in Sheela.

917
00:59:52,179 --> 00:59:53,806
Its true.

918
00:59:54,181 --> 01:00:00,279
They are younger than us, but we
have so much to learn from them!

919
01:00:02,189 --> 01:00:04,282
Hey.. just pass it.

920
01:00:10,597 --> 01:00:11,655
Good Morning.

921
01:00:15,502 --> 01:00:22,101
My name is Karthik..

922
01:00:22,176 --> 01:00:24,406
Karthik.

923
01:00:27,448 --> 01:00:35,116
Your name is Archana..

924
01:00:35,189 --> 01:00:38,488
Archana.

925
01:00:41,428 --> 01:00:43,589
That is a Dog.

926
01:00:44,231 --> 01:00:45,698
Angry Dog.

927
01:00:49,236 --> 01:00:50,430
Sorry sir.

928
01:00:50,504 --> 01:00:52,267
No.. no.. no. It's okay.

929
01:00:54,174 --> 01:00:55,835
Be there it self. Be there.

930
01:01:06,253 --> 01:01:07,515
Okay.. okay.

931
01:01:10,290 --> 01:01:11,655
Now, watch.

932
01:01:58,238 --> 01:02:02,299
''The wind's language..

933
01:02:03,677 --> 01:02:07,636
Is it sound.. or music?''

934
01:02:09,583 --> 01:02:13,713
''The flower's language..

935
01:02:15,255 --> 01:02:19,282

936
01:02:20,794 --> 01:02:24,696
''The sea's language..

937
01:02:26,500 --> 01:02:30,300
Is it the waves.. or the froth?''

938
01:02:32,339 --> 01:02:36,332
''Love's language..

939
01:02:37,778 --> 01:02:42,306
Is it the eyes.. or the lips?''

940
01:02:45,185 --> 01:02:50,282
''If we understand nature's
language Words become redundant''

941
01:02:50,357 --> 01:02:54,123
''If we understand the
heart's language Language ..

''When the wind blows
It has no direction..''

948
01:03:49,249 --> 01:03:54,346
''When love
communicates There is no language''

949
01:03:54,421 --> 01:03:57,857
''Language doesn't understand

950
01:03:58,191 --> 01:04:00,659
The language of Silence..''

951
01:04:00,727 --> 01:04:04,094
''Even God will not understand

952
01:04:04,197 --> 01:04:06,290
The language of the eyes''

953
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:12,270
''One cannot give form
To the free flowing air''

954
01:04:12,339 --> 01:04:18,278
''Love's language cannot be
Curtailed in Sound's web''

955

The wind's language..

01:05:06,727 --> 01:05:11,687
''The sky's words Are the rain drops''

960
01:05:11,765 --> 01:05:16,828
''The rainbows words Are its colors''

972
01:06:23,570 --> 01:06:25,731
Good Morning.
- Good Morning, Babu.

973
01:06:25,806 --> 01:06:27,831
Today is my birthday!

974
01:06:29,509 --> 01:06:31,568
Bless me, sir.
- Babu.

975
01:06:45,458 --> 01:06:47,426
Here take this book.

976
01:06:48,595 --> 01:06:49,789
Thank you, sir.

977
01:06:50,297 --> 01:06:52,561
This book will be
very useful to you.

978
01:06:52,599 --> 01:06:54,089
In fifteen years time..

979
01:06:54,167 --> 01:06:56,158
..the world will
depend on Computers.

980
01:06:56,236 --> 01:06:59,637
Writer Sujata has
also written about this.

981
01:06:59,706 --> 01:07:02,300
Nobody listens, when I tell them.

982
01:07:02,375 --> 01:07:03,808
Read this book..

983
01:07:04,177 --> 01:07:06,304
..and any doubts, you ask me!

984
01:07:06,379 --> 01:07:07,846
Anytime, okay?

985
01:07:11,518 --> 01:07:13,110
What's your Star sign?

986
01:07:13,186 --> 01:07:14,312
Chitirai

987
01:07:14,387 --> 01:07:16,287
That is Virgo.
- Right

988
01:07:16,356 --> 01:07:18,449
Am going to the temple. I'll
make an offering in your name.

989
01:07:18,525 --> 01:07:20,117
Krishnan, dispose this
Omni at the earliest..

990
01:07:20,193 --> 01:07:23,788
..and there is a model
called Maruti 1000. Buy that.

991
01:07:24,297 --> 01:07:26,458
Very good mileage. Good pick up.

992
01:07:34,708 --> 01:07:41,443
Good Morning.
- Oh! That. It's my birthday today.

993
01:07:42,515 --> 01:07:43,607
Thank you.

994
01:07:44,784 --> 01:07:46,843
My mom called. I was talking to her.

995
01:07:47,587 --> 01:07:48,781
That's why late!

996
01:07:50,590 --> 01:07:54,822
Professor gave me this as
birthday gift. Yes.. yes.

997
01:07:55,295 --> 01:07:57,490
But nobody understands him here.

998
01:08:01,301 --> 01:08:02,461
What else to do.

999
01:08:02,502 --> 01:08:05,528
As usual. With friends..
party and hotel.

1000
01:08:11,344 --> 01:08:13,437
Something useful? Like what?

1001
01:08:34,234 --> 01:08:36,293
I have never seen you here before.

1002
01:08:36,369 --> 01:08:40,772
Thanks for volunteering
such a generous donation.

1003
01:08:40,840 --> 01:08:42,831
Thank you so much.
- No mother.

1004
01:08:43,243 --> 01:08:46,303
You're doing so much good.
Its only a donation.

1005
01:08:46,379 --> 01:08:49,746
God bless you. Many happy returns.
- Thank you, Mother.

1006
01:08:58,591 --> 01:08:59,853
Where is Archana?

1007
01:09:18,712 --> 01:09:22,842
They're clapping for you!
Wishing you for your birthday

1008
01:09:39,499 --> 01:09:40,761
This is for your donation!

1009
01:09:52,579 --> 01:09:56,709
I've celebrated many birthdays.
This one will be unforgettable.

1010
01:10:02,255 --> 01:10:03,381
Home?

1011
01:10:06,393 --> 01:10:07,519
Come in son

1012
01:10:10,397 --> 01:10:12,092
Is it? Happy Birthday!

1013
01:10:35,522 --> 01:10:36,682
You drew this?

1014
01:10:41,227 --> 01:10:42,455
The Moon.

1015
01:10:46,666 --> 01:10:48,258
Oh. The Moon.

1016
01:10:50,637 --> 01:10:52,264
The moon reminds me of this story..

1017
01:10:52,338 --> 01:10:54,272
..my mother used to tell me

1018
01:10:56,409 --> 01:10:58,468
Tale.. Story!

1019
01:11:01,714 --> 01:11:03,113
If we miss someone a lot..

1020
01:11:03,183 --> 01:11:06,118
..then think of them
and look at the moon,

1021
01:11:06,186 --> 01:11:08,313
you will see their face in it.

1022
01:11:10,390 --> 01:11:11,652
I used to love my grand mom.

1023
01:11:11,724 --> 01:11:14,124
Whenever I missed her,..

1024
01:11:14,194 --> 01:11:18,756
..I used to see the moon
and I could see her face.

1025
01:11:24,237 --> 01:11:26,296
Your mom never told you stories?

1026
01:11:34,581 --> 01:11:35,741
Do you miss anybody?

1027
01:11:39,719 --> 01:11:41,243
You don't miss anybody?

1028
01:12:08,114 --> 01:12:09,274
Soap!

1029
01:12:11,451 --> 01:12:14,318
You made this? Wow!

1030
01:12:19,592 --> 01:12:20,718
For me?

1031
01:12:24,497 --> 01:12:29,560
Gift. Thank you.

1032
01:12:47,253 --> 01:12:49,118
Here you are. Shall we start?

1033
01:12:49,189 --> 01:12:51,123
Ok. Your first lesson.
Is this a keyboard?

1034
01:12:51,191 --> 01:12:52,317
Yes, Uncle.

1035
01:12:52,392 --> 01:12:58,194
A Keyboard should not be
used as a dining table! Ok?

1036
01:12:58,231 --> 01:13:00,791
Ok, Uncle.
- You are already half Rehman!

1037
01:13:01,467 --> 01:13:03,628
No. Wait. First I will teach you.

1038
01:13:03,703 --> 01:13:06,501
You play, and then eat one pakoda.
- Okay, Uncle.

1039
01:13:07,640 --> 01:13:09,107
Keep your fingers here and..

1040
01:13:09,175 --> 01:13:14,511
Cdef.. Gapc.

1041
01:13:14,581 --> 01:13:16,811
You are teaching me A B
C D in the wrong order?

1042
01:13:17,183 --> 01:13:20,641
Oh my little genius you! See this..

1043
01:13:20,720 --> 01:13:25,419
sa ri ga ma pa da ni sa.

1044
01:13:28,194 --> 01:13:30,685
sa ri ga ma pa da ni sa.

1045
01:13:33,666 --> 01:13:36,100
You seem to be doing
only one thing right!

1046
01:13:36,169 --> 01:13:37,295
Keep at it.

1047
01:13:37,370 --> 01:13:39,600
Keep practicing, I'll be right back

1048
01:13:43,343 --> 01:13:46,335
Hey that boy..
What the hell is this?

1049
01:13:46,412 --> 01:13:49,108
There is music in a violin.
Can a Violin become Music?

1050
01:13:49,182 --> 01:13:51,514
That fatso is better off..

1051
01:13:52,252 --> 01:13:55,710
Isn't Archana also
like that? What happened?

1052
01:13:56,189 --> 01:13:58,123
I was thinking
- what if like Archana,

1053
01:13:58,191 --> 01:14:00,557
I could also not
hear your nutty laments

1054
01:14:00,627 --> 01:14:02,595
Correct. I was thinking jus that.

1055
01:14:02,662 --> 01:14:05,460
I want to know what
her world is like.

1056
01:14:05,498 --> 01:14:07,398
Great! Do one thing.

1057
01:14:07,467 --> 01:14:09,094
Like Gandhari in Mahabharath..

1058
01:14:09,168 --> 01:14:11,102
..going blind after marriage..

1059
01:14:11,170 --> 01:14:13,104
..to see her husband's
world; you also shut your ears..

1060
01:14:13,172 --> 01:14:14,730
- Brilliant idea.

1061
01:14:16,242 --> 01:14:18,369
Hey! Are you nuts?

1062
01:14:19,345 --> 01:14:20,505
Please, Viji.

1063
01:14:31,190 --> 01:14:34,591
I have already stuffed 2
rolls of cotton into your ears.

1064
01:14:34,661 --> 01:14:36,458
If I have to stuff
more I need Cement.

1065
01:14:37,697 --> 01:14:38,789
Can't you hear me?

1066
01:14:39,198 --> 01:14:40,597
Is that so? Ok

1067
01:14:47,751 --> 01:14:48,843
Am leaving now

1068
01:14:49,353 --> 01:14:50,479
Am so proud of you man

1069
01:14:50,554 --> 01:14:51,714
No. Don't have to come with me.

1070
01:14:52,890 --> 01:14:54,983
Poor child! Seems to
have finally lost it

1071
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:31,285
Don't be a fool to think
that she'll love you..

1072
01:16:31,355 --> 01:16:33,619
..if you do such stupid things

1073
01:16:35,593 --> 01:16:38,289
Remember, you
watch planes fly high..

1074
01:16:38,362 --> 01:16:41,559
..while we fly in those very planes.

1075
01:16:41,632 --> 01:16:46,899
Understand this and back
off. I am warning you.

1076
01:16:55,346 --> 01:16:56,836
Okay, break.

1077
01:17:00,751 --> 01:17:01,979
Did you hear that female's voice?

1078
01:17:02,419 --> 01:17:03,886
Doesn't that Sound like
the director dubbed for her?

1079
01:17:05,689 --> 01:17:06,951
Hey what is it?

1080
01:17:07,858 --> 01:17:09,018
No, Viji..

1081
01:17:10,694 --> 01:17:12,889
If Archana had a voice,
how would it sound?

1082
01:17:12,963 --> 01:17:14,760
It could sound like
that scary lady's voice

1083
01:17:14,832 --> 01:17:17,426
It'll sound like
Lata Mangeshkar's voice.

1084
01:17:17,501 --> 01:17:18,968
Have you heard her talking?

1085
01:17:19,303 --> 01:17:20,497
No

1086
01:17:20,571 --> 01:17:22,300
Some people who sing well,
sound awful talking.

1087
01:17:22,373 --> 01:17:23,840
Haven't you heard that?

1088
01:17:24,642 --> 01:17:26,940
Archana's voice will sound perfect

1089
01:17:27,344 --> 01:17:28,641
Have it your way!

1090
01:17:28,679 --> 01:17:32,342
I never thought of this!
- What?

1091
01:17:32,416 --> 01:17:34,680
No, Viji. Think about it.

1092
01:17:34,752 --> 01:17:36,686
Archana talks to
me in sign language.

1093
01:17:36,754 --> 01:17:38,278
What if I imagine a
voice for her when she does.

1094
01:17:38,355 --> 01:17:39,686
I don't understand

1095
01:17:40,457 --> 01:17:42,288
Whenever she talks to me..

1096
01:17:42,359 --> 01:17:44,486
..I will hear a beautiful
voice that I will imagine.

1097
01:17:45,696 --> 01:17:46,822
Like a dubbed film?!

1098
01:17:48,799 --> 01:17:50,460
Waste of time talking to you!

1099
01:17:50,534 --> 01:17:51,626
Where are you going?

1100
01:17:51,702 --> 01:17:53,533
Am going to listen to her voice.

1101
01:17:53,604 --> 01:17:56,767
She'll be thrilled to know
she has a beautiful voice.

1102
01:17:56,874 --> 01:17:59,035
You keep plucking on your chords.

1103
01:17:59,643 --> 01:18:02,271
We have heard of 1330 Tirukkurals..

1104
01:18:02,346 --> 01:18:05,281
..but he has set out
to hear one extra one

1105
01:18:05,349 --> 01:18:06,611
Tamilnadu's new discovery!

1106
01:18:28,772 --> 01:18:30,262
I came to see you.

1107
01:18:32,409 --> 01:18:33,637
Tell me your name

1108
01:18:35,679 --> 01:18:36,805
Tell me your name

1109
01:18:38,749 --> 01:18:41,479
Archana. Archana.

1110
01:18:43,454 --> 01:18:44,751
Tell me my name now

1111
01:18:45,355 --> 01:18:46,481
Why?

1112
01:18:46,557 --> 01:18:48,616
I will tell you.
First tell me my name

1113
01:18:50,594 --> 01:18:53,563
Karthik.. Karthik.

1114
01:18:53,630 --> 01:18:54,756
Beautiful.

1115
01:18:54,832 --> 01:18:58,461
What are you doing here?
- We have come on a picnic

1116
01:18:58,535 --> 01:19:00,298
Yes.
- Wait.

1117
01:19:00,370 --> 01:19:03,771
What's all this?
- Your voice is beautiful.

1118
01:19:05,642 --> 01:19:06,734
My Voice?

1119
01:19:07,845 --> 01:19:11,337
Yes Archana. When you talk I
am imagining a voice for you.

1120
01:19:12,950 --> 01:19:15,350
And do you know.. it
sounds so beautiful!

1121
01:19:15,419 --> 01:19:17,284
Why do I need a Voice?

1122
01:19:17,354 --> 01:19:19,948
When I talk with you
it'll be easier for me.

1123
01:19:20,357 --> 01:19:22,825
So you are finding it tough now?

1124
01:19:22,893 --> 01:19:25,293
Not tough. But just that
we can get more fluent..

1125
01:19:25,362 --> 01:19:26,556
Enough.

1126
01:19:28,766 --> 01:19:31,360
If talking to me is so tough,
then don't bother.

1127
01:19:34,738 --> 01:19:37,036
No.. Archana, it's not that.
I didn't mean that.

1128
01:19:39,676 --> 01:19:41,268
You can hear the
voice you have imagined..

1129
01:19:41,345 --> 01:19:43,404
..but I won't because that's not Me.

1130
01:19:43,480 --> 01:19:44,742
So when you talk with me..

1131
01:19:44,815 --> 01:19:47,283
..will you be talking
to this other person?

1132
01:19:47,351 --> 01:19:51,651
Is the real ME so
difficult for you to handle?

1133
01:19:52,856 --> 01:19:57,623
I am happy dealing with people
who accept me for what I am.

1134
01:19:58,695 --> 01:19:59,787
Why do I need..?

1135
01:20:01,532 --> 01:20:06,629
Stop it. Stop imagining a
voice for me. I don't want it

1136
01:20:31,695 --> 01:20:34,493
Archana.. Archana. I am sorry.

1137
01:20:34,565 --> 01:20:35,725
I didn't mean it that way.

1138
01:20:35,799 --> 01:20:36,959
I only meant it in good humour.

1139
01:20:46,877 --> 01:20:48,742
What happened?

1140
01:20:48,846 --> 01:20:51,747
I didn't understand
what she said last.

1141
01:20:54,618 --> 01:20:56,415
I don't have a voice.

1142
01:20:58,589 --> 01:20:59,681
Don't need one either

1143
01:21:04,695 --> 01:21:06,856
I have nothing to say to this world.

1144
01:21:08,432 --> 01:21:09,626
What happened?

1145
01:21:15,706 --> 01:21:17,537
I'll speak to you later.

1146
01:21:36,760 --> 01:21:38,421
You could've just shut up

1147
01:21:38,495 --> 01:21:40,690
Why discover something imaginary

1148
01:21:40,764 --> 01:21:43,426
Now just imagine your love life!

1149
01:21:43,500 --> 01:21:44,558
I didn't know she'll react this way!

1150
01:21:44,635 --> 01:21:45,693
If you want to discover..

1151
01:21:45,769 --> 01:21:46,827
..why not something more useful!

1152
01:21:46,904 --> 01:21:47,962
Herbal Petrol, Tsunami detectors?

1153
01:21:48,038 --> 01:21:50,871
Discovering imaginary voices!

1154
01:21:50,974 --> 01:21:52,271
I thought she'd like it

1155
01:21:52,376 --> 01:21:53,866
Sure
- Now what do I do?

1156
01:21:53,944 --> 01:21:55,536
Sit by yourself and discover

1157
01:21:55,579 --> 01:21:57,410
Why are you fighting?

1158
01:21:57,481 --> 01:21:59,278
Is this what we struggled for?

1159
01:21:59,349 --> 01:22:01,283
What did I do wrong?

1160
01:22:01,351 --> 01:22:02,841
Think about it.

1161
01:22:02,920 --> 01:22:04,285
So far, you have accepted her..

1162
01:22:04,354 --> 01:22:07,448
.. for what she is and
she has got used to that.

1163
01:22:07,524 --> 01:22:09,287
Bringing up her voice now..

1164
01:22:09,359 --> 01:22:11,657
..only points out
you feel she is flawed.

1165
01:22:11,728 --> 01:22:14,561
Her being upset is justified.

1166
01:22:14,631 --> 01:22:15,689
What if I..

1167
01:22:15,766 --> 01:22:17,290
..told you to imagine
yourself as being beautiful..

1168
01:22:17,367 --> 01:22:18,891
Won't it upset you?!
- Hello.

1169
01:22:18,969 --> 01:22:20,402
This was a joke!

1170
01:22:20,504 --> 01:22:22,563
Please don't stop talking to me.

1171
01:22:23,640 --> 01:22:25,631
I realize I have goofed up.

1172
01:22:25,676 --> 01:22:27,268
Even when she was telling me off..

1173
01:22:27,344 --> 01:22:28,470
..I continued
imagining a voice for her.

1174
01:22:28,545 --> 01:22:29,876
I will apologize

1175
01:22:29,947 --> 01:22:33,713
Be sure what you are going
to tell her when you meet.

1176
01:22:47,364 --> 01:22:52,301
''Oh woman who speaks with her
eyes.. Will you forgive me?''

1177
01:22:52,369 --> 01:22:56,533
''I ask you in poetry
Will you forgive me?''

1178
01:22:56,606 --> 01:23:00,269
''Oh pure moon Will you forgive me?''

1179
01:23:00,344 --> 01:23:06,749
''By mistake I made a
mistake Will you forgive me?''

1180
01:23:06,817 --> 01:23:12,414
''Please listen to my plea..
Why are you so angry?''

1181
01:23:12,489 --> 01:23:15,287
''Look at me with
your mysterious eyes ..

1182
01:23:15,359 --> 01:23:17,691
''..And withdraw your
curses completely..''

1183
01:23:17,761 --> 01:23:22,562
''Oh woman who speaks with her
eyes.. Will you forgive me?''

1184
01:23:22,632 --> 01:23:27,831
''I ask you in poetry
Will you forgive me?''

1185
01:23:55,432 --> 01:24:05,398
''The moon does not
talk That is not a flaw''

1186
01:24:07,444 --> 01:24:12,541
''If a flaw is considered beautiful..

1187
01:24:12,616 --> 01:24:14,550
..Even life becomes ideal''

1188
01:24:14,618 --> 01:24:20,557
''Oh woman I have understood
You being yourself is beauty''

1189
01:24:20,624 --> 01:24:26,494
''I will not paint a flower
And draw on it a moustache''

1190
01:24:26,563 --> 01:24:31,523
''When you speak with your silence
I will not draw sound from it''

1191
01:24:31,601 --> 01:24:34,695
''When the dark
night holds a crescent

1192
01:24:34,771 --> 01:24:36,671
Why force a full moon from it''

1193
01:24:36,773 --> 01:24:41,836
''My life seems
listless My heart is bitter''

1194
01:24:41,878 --> 01:24:46,679
''Gesture that you forgive me
Withdraw your curses completely''

1195
01:24:46,750 --> 01:24:52,279
Oh! I'm Sorry.. I'm
sorry.. I'm sorry.

1196
01:24:52,355 --> 01:24:58,453
Oh! Oh! I'm sorry..
I'm sorry.. I'm sorry.

1197
01:24:58,528 --> 01:25:01,964
''Oh woman who speaks with her
eyes.. Will you forgive me?''

1198
01:25:02,032 --> 01:25:06,935
''I ask you in poetry
Will you forgive me?''

1199
01:25:39,636 --> 01:25:43,003
''The smile that you wore,

1200
01:25:44,407 --> 01:25:48,639
The mischief that you showed,''

1201
01:25:50,347 --> 01:25:53,714
''Where did they go?''

1202
01:25:54,451 --> 01:25:56,282
''Your eyes holding
the deep blue sea ..

1203
01:25:56,353 --> 01:25:59,754
..Of a storm they
seem to be warning me''

1204
01:25:59,823 --> 01:26:05,625
''You don't have to cajole
me Just a shrug will do''

1205
01:26:05,695 --> 01:26:08,687
''You don't have to be over friendly

1206
01:26:08,765 --> 01:26:10,699
Just a half smile will do''

1207
01:26:10,767 --> 01:26:15,830
''I don't want an angry
glare Just a glance will do''

1208
01:26:15,906 --> 01:26:21,401
''I don't want open doors
Just a window will do''

1209
01:26:21,478 --> 01:26:26,814
''My life passes me Days pass me''

1210
01:26:26,883 --> 01:26:31,547
''Use your mesmerizing eyes
And give me back my life''

1211
01:26:31,621 --> 01:26:37,287
Oh! I'm Sorry.. I'm
sorry.. I'm sorry.

1212
01:26:37,360 --> 01:26:42,889
Oh! Oh! I'm sorry..
I'm sorry.. I'm sorry.

1213
01:26:42,966 --> 01:26:46,800
''Oh woman who speaks with her
eyes.. Will you forgive me?''

1214
01:26:46,870 --> 01:26:51,830
''I ask you in poetry
Will you forgive me?''

1215
01:26:52,876 --> 01:26:57,677
''Oh pure moon Will you forgive me?''

1216
01:26:57,747 --> 01:27:02,582
''By mistake I made a
mistake Will you forgive me?''

1217
01:27:02,652 --> 01:27:07,817
''Please listen to my plea..
Why are you so angry?''

1218
01:27:07,891 --> 01:27:13,454
''Look at me with
your mysterious eyes ..

1219
01:27:19,703 --> 01:27:21,637
And withdraw your curses completely.

1220
01:27:21,705 --> 01:27:24,674
I didn't do it on purpose.

1221
01:27:29,446 --> 01:27:30,708
Babu, Please listen.

1222
01:27:30,780 --> 01:27:32,338
Babu, stay there. Archana, go home.

1223
01:27:32,415 --> 01:27:34,508
Go home.

1224
01:27:34,584 --> 01:27:35,642
What is this, Babu?

1225
01:27:35,719 --> 01:27:36,879
Walking around
casually at such a time.

1226
01:27:36,953 --> 01:27:38,614
What happened?

1227
01:27:39,422 --> 01:27:41,515
Indira Gandhi has been assassinated.

1228
01:27:42,859 --> 01:27:46,420
She was shot by her own body
guards. 36 bullets, you know.

1229
01:27:46,496 --> 01:27:47,622
There are riots in Delhi.

1230
01:27:47,697 --> 01:27:49,028
They are killing all Sikhs.

1231
01:27:49,366 --> 01:27:51,300
There could be unrest here.

1232
01:27:51,368 --> 01:27:54,360
I have locked the front
gate so nobody leaves.

1233
01:27:54,404 --> 01:27:55,962
Come here

1234
01:27:56,039 --> 01:27:57,267
No point depending
on that secretary.

1235
01:27:57,374 --> 01:27:58,841
He is an
irresponsible idiot, you know.

1236
01:28:05,348 --> 01:28:06,713
Why don't you buy me
a pair of slippers!

1237
01:28:11,421 --> 01:28:12,615
MGR doesn't know this yet.

1238
01:28:12,689 --> 01:28:14,884
About your torn slippers?
- Stupid, Hey?

1239
01:28:14,958 --> 01:28:17,449
Am talking about Mrs.
Gandhi's death.

1240
01:28:17,527 --> 01:28:20,291
MGR is in hospital, how
is he going to bear this.

1241
01:28:20,363 --> 01:28:21,796
Yeah it'll be tough

1242
01:28:21,865 --> 01:28:23,298
If a Prime Minister
herself is not safe..

1243
01:28:23,366 --> 01:28:24,628
Where is this country going to?

1244
01:28:31,574 --> 01:28:34,543
I knew you would be
leaving at this time

1245
01:28:34,644 --> 01:28:38,273
What you don't know is,
that I have been waiting

1246
01:28:38,348 --> 01:28:39,610
What do you want?

1247
01:28:46,623 --> 01:28:50,354
I feel shy looking into
your eyes and talking.

1248
01:28:52,929 --> 01:28:56,296
Sachin, Shahrukh may
drive women crazy,..

1249
01:28:56,366 --> 01:28:59,563
..but you drive all women crazy.

1250
01:28:59,636 --> 01:29:00,967
Please don't go.

1251
01:29:02,739 --> 01:29:06,937
If there is any beauty in this
apartment, it's because of you.

1252
01:29:08,411 --> 01:29:10,743
I may be younger than you..

1253
01:29:10,814 --> 01:29:16,753
..but I lost my heart
the moment I saw you

1254
01:29:18,355 --> 01:29:19,481
Your Hairstyle..

1255
01:29:20,690 --> 01:29:21,918
.. your eyes ..

1256
01:29:23,460 --> 01:29:24,688
..that smile ..

1257
01:29:26,429 --> 01:29:28,727
.. so many things about you!

1258
01:29:28,798 --> 01:29:29,992
But..

1259
01:29:49,352 --> 01:29:54,949
''My dear, will you hear my song?'

1260
01:29:55,358 --> 01:29:59,021
'Dear one, are you sad?''

1261
01:30:00,864 --> 01:30:04,459
What is this racket
late in the night?

1262
01:30:04,534 --> 01:30:07,901
I am talking to you.
Can you hear me?

1263
01:30:08,371 --> 01:30:09,633
What happened?

1264
01:30:09,706 --> 01:30:12,266
Just as an object comes
crashing down when you drop it..

1265
01:30:12,375 --> 01:30:14,275
..from the third to
the ground floor..

1266
01:30:14,344 --> 01:30:17,677
.. my age has too, from
45 years to a mere 28.

1267
01:30:17,747 --> 01:30:21,274
Something's wrong with
you. Since that day..

1268
01:30:21,351 --> 01:30:22,477
Which day?

1269
01:30:22,552 --> 01:30:25,350
Since that day you saw
something and got frightened!

1270
01:30:25,422 --> 01:30:28,448
Why did you have to
remind me of that?!

1271
01:30:28,525 --> 01:30:30,857
Be quiet. The Child will wake up

1272
01:30:30,927 --> 01:30:33,361
Stuff him with chips if he does.

1273
01:30:34,764 --> 01:30:38,495
''What do I tell you? My
heart can't bear this.''

1274
01:30:38,568 --> 01:30:42,470
How do I bear this? I
don't get sleep too.

1275
01:30:42,539 --> 01:30:50,412
Who doesn't have to face this pain?

1276
01:30:50,480 --> 01:30:57,852
There is no one above
you in this village.

1277
01:30:58,955 --> 01:31:02,686
I just revealed my sorrow
through singing my song.

1278
01:31:05,562 --> 01:31:10,932
My dear prince, your
sorrow is the one..''

1279
01:31:24,347 --> 01:31:26,781
Did something massive fall down?

1280
01:31:27,617 --> 01:31:28,675
Viji.

1281
01:31:37,560 --> 01:31:39,425
Why is he wearing a blouse?!

1282
01:31:42,932 --> 01:31:47,596
Why are you all staring at me
like an odd exhibit. Help me

1283
01:31:47,670 --> 01:31:49,297
Don't worry sir. He is all right.

1284
01:31:49,372 --> 01:31:51,363
How do you say that?

1285
01:31:51,407 --> 01:31:53,272
Even as he was falling..

1286
01:31:53,343 --> 01:31:56,744
..he was telling me to
switch the motor off.

1287
01:31:56,813 --> 01:31:58,280
Does Aunty know yet?
- Don't ask!

1288
01:31:58,348 --> 01:32:00,282
I called them to inform.

1289
01:32:00,350 --> 01:32:02,284
Told his son about him.

1290
01:32:02,352 --> 01:32:04,286
He told me to get him some Chips!

1291
01:32:04,354 --> 01:32:06,481
Is he a son or a Grinder?

1292
01:32:06,556 --> 01:32:07,648
How did he fall?

1293
01:32:08,758 --> 01:32:10,623
You won't believe me..

1294
01:32:13,463 --> 01:32:14,521
I hope he didn't get hurt.

1295
01:32:14,831 --> 01:32:16,355
You too, Viji.

1296
01:32:16,466 --> 01:32:18,331
While falling down he
caught the cable TV wire..

1297
01:32:18,401 --> 01:32:20,335
..telephone cable, etc..

1298
01:32:20,436 --> 01:32:22,336
..and hanging on it, he
landed safely like Spider Man.

1299
01:32:23,339 --> 01:32:25,364
They took him to the hospital.

1300
01:32:30,346 --> 01:32:31,938
But Viji, this is a
very good opportunity.

1301
01:32:32,015 --> 01:32:33,505
To finish him off completely?

1302
01:32:34,384 --> 01:32:35,749
Tomorrow morning, I am
going to meet him to enquire..

1303
01:32:35,818 --> 01:32:37,615
..about his health
with a banquet and..

1304
01:32:37,687 --> 01:32:39,621
..the sacred
vermillion of Goddess Kali.

1305
01:32:39,789 --> 01:32:41,518
I will join you too.

1306
01:32:41,624 --> 01:32:42,784
No, Viji.. you will
spoil the mood if you come.

1307
01:32:42,992 --> 01:32:46,928
I won't speak even a single word.

1308
01:32:46,996 --> 01:32:48,258
I will ask with my
eyes only whether..

1309
01:32:48,331 --> 01:32:49,423
..he is fine just like
Thillana Mohanambal.

1310
01:32:49,499 --> 01:32:50,591
Hey, you may play with me alone.

1311
01:32:50,667 --> 01:32:54,330
Don't play tricks on my life. Okay?

1312
01:33:02,512 --> 01:33:03,638
Viji!

1313
01:33:04,347 --> 01:33:05,712
Oh! Please come.. come.

1314
01:33:20,330 --> 01:33:23,527
Congratulations! Sorry sir,
it was a slip of the tongue.

1315
01:33:26,336 --> 01:33:27,394
In the morning..

1316
01:33:27,470 --> 01:33:28,528
..I had gone to the Thiruverkkadu..

1317
01:33:28,605 --> 01:33:29,663
..temple to do a Kumbabhishekam
(Temple's foundation day )..

1318
01:33:29,739 --> 01:33:30,797
I mean, we performed
a floral offering..

1319
01:33:30,873 --> 01:33:31,931
..on sir's name to the goddess.

1320
01:33:32,008 --> 01:33:33,669
As soon as sir recovers..

1321
01:33:33,743 --> 01:33:35,677
..I have prayed to shave off
the head and lift a kavadi.

1322
01:33:36,679 --> 01:33:38,772
Hey, shaving off the head
is not for me. But, for sir.

1323
01:33:39,349 --> 01:33:43,342
Won't sir lift a kavadi and all?

1324
01:33:43,453 --> 01:33:44,943
This is very much required
for the work he has done.

1325
01:33:45,021 --> 01:33:46,386
I am not able to face people.

1326
01:33:46,656 --> 01:33:48,817
Aunty, poor man.- Then what? Will a
nyone fear of a dead cockroach?

1327
01:33:48,891 --> 01:33:50,882
That didn't die.
- Oh! Is it alive?

1328
01:33:50,994 --> 01:33:52,689
Where have they admitted it?

1329
01:33:56,966 --> 01:33:59,332
Sir, hope you didn't get much hurt.

1330
01:33:59,402 --> 01:34:01,336
Any way, it would be
better to exercise..

1331
01:34:01,471 --> 01:34:02,529
Hey, keep quiet. Sir, I
need to ask you a small doubt.

1332
01:34:02,672 --> 01:34:04,902
What is it?

1333
01:34:04,974 --> 01:34:07,602
Sir, did you fall down while hitt
ing the cockroach or..

1334
01:34:07,710 --> 01:34:09,473
.. after hitting the cockroach?

1335
01:34:09,612 --> 01:34:13,378
Are these details
required now it self?

1336
01:34:13,483 --> 01:34:17,783
Many people have many
doubts even at our flat.

1337
01:34:18,354 --> 01:34:19,446
The watchman is the
only person who says..

1338
01:34:19,522 --> 01:34:21,422
..that you hit the cockroach.

1339
01:34:22,992 --> 01:34:26,291
Rest, every one is saying
that you bit the cockroach, sir.

1340
01:34:26,329 --> 01:34:28,263
Will you please get out?

1341
01:34:38,408 --> 01:34:39,466
Sorry.

1342
01:34:42,478 --> 01:34:43,536
Sorry.

1343
01:34:47,417 --> 01:34:48,475
Sorry. Hey.

1344
01:35:07,603 --> 01:35:08,661
Hey, Karthik..

1345
01:35:36,599 --> 01:35:38,692
Still.. still, you
shouldn't have done that.

1346
01:35:38,835 --> 01:35:40,325
I was controlling myself a lot.

1347
01:35:40,470 --> 01:35:42,335
He was the one who
started about that cockroach.

1348
01:35:42,505 --> 01:35:44,803
Who, me? That is the reason why I
asked you not to come along.

1349
01:35:44,874 --> 01:35:46,933
Was it possible to control the
laughter on seeing his state?

1350
01:35:55,351 --> 01:35:56,443
I am sorry, Archana.

1351
01:36:12,335 --> 01:36:14,599
Yes. Open it and see.

1352
01:36:29,352 --> 01:36:32,446
A music is coming from inside.

1353
01:36:34,524 --> 01:36:35,616
Thank you.

1354
01:36:36,325 --> 01:36:38,418
Sir, excuse me.
- Thank you.

1355
01:36:39,328 --> 01:36:42,320
Archana.. hope you
won't misunderstand..

1356
01:36:42,398 --> 01:36:44,332
..if I ask you one thing.

1357
01:36:47,336 --> 01:36:50,669
What is music according to you?

1358
01:36:52,341 --> 01:36:56,368
What is music
according to you? What is it?

1359
01:37:04,520 --> 01:37:05,578
Okay.
- Sorry.

1360
01:37:07,323 --> 01:37:08,415
For all of you, music means joy.

1361
01:37:10,893 --> 01:37:13,657
For me, Music is another language.

1362
01:37:15,498 --> 01:37:18,763
I don't know Hindi.

1363
01:37:19,335 --> 01:37:21,895
Don't know Chinese.

1364
01:37:24,507 --> 01:37:28,671
In the same way, I
don't know music also.

1365
01:37:34,350 --> 01:37:35,442
But, a language that I know, none
of you know. Silence!

1366
01:37:39,388 --> 01:37:47,420
''Silence.. that silence
is the beauty in you.''

1367
01:37:48,664 --> 01:37:56,833
''The vision is enough. Try
to speak the words with it.''

1368
01:37:58,441 --> 01:38:02,468
''Silence.. that silence
is the beauty in you.''

1369
01:38:02,612 --> 01:38:06,571
''The vision is enough. Try
to speak the words with it.''

1370
01:38:07,550 --> 01:38:12,453
''In the words which are
spoken and finished..''

1371
01:38:12,588 --> 01:38:16,524
''..there remains a meaning.''

1372
01:38:22,465 --> 01:38:26,697
''..there remains
crores of meanings.''

1373
01:38:27,003 --> 01:38:31,770
This is my gift to you.

1374
01:38:31,874 --> 01:38:36,334
Bye.

1375
01:39:30,499 --> 01:39:33,332
On that day, the reason why
you stood turning your back..

1376
01:39:33,469 --> 01:39:35,437
..I could understand it now
only when I looked at your face.

1377
01:39:37,773 --> 01:39:39,741
When I look at you, a
thousand butterflies crave..

1378
01:39:39,809 --> 01:39:42,004
..without getting a
place to sit in my heart.

1379
01:39:42,345 --> 01:39:45,280
On seeing you, my age is
hanging on the foot board..

1380
01:39:45,348 --> 01:39:46,645
..just like a college student.

1381
01:39:46,782 --> 01:39:49,910
A kite which had forgotten to fly..

1382
01:39:49,986 --> 01:39:53,786
..after being
stuck on an apple tree.

1383
01:39:54,323 --> 01:39:56,382
I never expected that
it would fly once again.

1384
01:40:00,496 --> 01:40:02,259
Why are you staring like that?

1385
01:40:02,331 --> 01:40:04,561
Can't you understand that
I was waiting for you only?

1386
01:40:05,534 --> 01:40:08,332
Don't go away. I can
understand your confusion.

1387
01:40:09,338 --> 01:40:12,899
I might have scolded you
with love in this apartment.

1388
01:40:12,975 --> 01:40:17,344
You need not tell any thing.
I have the right for it.

1389
01:40:18,681 --> 01:40:20,273
The way I suffer
without getting proper..

1390
01:40:20,349 --> 01:40:21,543
..sleep after having met you..

1391
01:40:23,552 --> 01:40:25,383
..it is totally a new experience.

1392
01:40:27,690 --> 01:40:31,820
But, would this society accept us?

1393
01:40:31,994 --> 01:40:33,359
Are we residing at America?

1394
01:40:34,497 --> 01:40:37,728
They shall never
accept it, sir. Never.

1395
01:40:37,867 --> 01:40:40,335
When did you come?

1396
01:40:40,436 --> 01:40:42,734
What is this, sir? I thought
that you have changed your mind..

1397
01:40:42,805 --> 01:40:44,329
..but, you are changed
as a man it self, sir.

1398
01:40:44,473 --> 01:40:45,531
Don't touch me, please sir.

1399
01:40:45,608 --> 01:40:46,666
How shameful and
embarrassing it would be..

1400
01:40:46,742 --> 01:40:47,800
..if your wife learns about this?

1401
01:40:47,910 --> 01:40:49,878
A bachelor's virginity has
become very unsecured, sir.

1402
01:40:49,945 --> 01:40:51,276
When did you..?
- Don't touch me, sir. Please.

1403
01:40:51,347 --> 01:40:53,110
I didn't expect this from you, sir.

1404
01:40:53,449 --> 01:40:54,848
Hey, brother.. brother.. listen..

1405
01:40:55,317 --> 01:40:56,443
..I was watching the
register of the office. Hey, Viji.

1406
01:40:57,787 --> 01:40:59,618
Are you working at a boy's hostel?

1407
01:40:59,688 --> 01:41:01,622
I shall leave not only this
apartment, but this state also.

1408
01:41:03,292 --> 01:41:05,419
Viji.. Viji.. Viji..- I'm not of
that type, sir. Please leave me.

1409
01:41:07,363 --> 01:41:08,421
At least tell me when you
came before you go. Sorry.

1410
01:41:08,764 --> 01:41:09,856
I never thought that you
will get so much corrupted..

1411
01:41:09,932 --> 01:41:11,263
..on seeing my puppy
shame just for once.

1412
01:41:16,338 --> 01:41:18,363
Come, son. Come inside.

1413
01:41:18,507 --> 01:41:22,568
.Babu.. come.. come.. come.

1414
01:41:24,346 --> 01:41:29,010
What is it, babu? Oh! Chapels!

1415
01:41:44,333 --> 01:41:46,426
Is it all right, sir?

1416
01:41:46,535 --> 01:41:48,696
Fits me like a glove. Good, Babu.

1417
01:41:55,678 --> 01:41:58,340
He has never asked for anything
to anyone like this ever before.

1418
01:41:58,914 --> 01:42:02,350
He asked me very rightfully.

1419
01:42:02,485 --> 01:42:04,646
If I say truly, I am very
happy that he asked me like this.

1420
01:42:05,354 --> 01:42:07,515
I did it just as I would
for my father. That's all.

1421
01:42:07,623 --> 01:42:09,523
I take your leave, mother.

1422
01:42:36,685 --> 01:42:37,743
So that's the end of the film?

1423
01:42:37,987 --> 01:42:39,386
That's the hero introduction.

1424
01:42:39,522 --> 01:42:41,615
How do you make music for this?

1425
01:42:41,790 --> 01:42:42,814
That's our fate!

1426
01:42:42,925 --> 01:42:46,793
Please sit down. Hasn't Aunty come?

1427
01:42:49,331 --> 01:42:53,700
We know him well. We're his
favourites. Especially Viji

1428
01:42:53,836 --> 01:42:57,328
Okay, fine. Archana..
- Will you eat something? - No

1429
01:42:57,473 --> 01:42:59,600
Cool drinks.
- no. Pepsi - No.

1430
01:42:59,675 --> 01:43:02,439
Coke?
- No. Sir, at least, tea?

1431
01:43:02,511 --> 01:43:03,603
Coffee? - No. Atleast, Bonda? -
No. - Sir, cake? - No. - Chips?

1432
01:43:03,679 --> 01:43:04,737
No.
- You can take it for Arjun, sir.

1433
01:43:04,813 --> 01:43:07,338
I said 'no thanks'!

1434
01:43:07,483 --> 01:43:09,383
I have to speak to Archana.
Will you keep quiet?

1435
01:43:09,985 --> 01:43:11,418
Okay, okay.
- Sir, popcorn is very nice..

1436
01:43:12,988 --> 01:43:14,512
Archana, what are you doing here?

1437
01:43:17,326 --> 01:43:19,385
We came shopping.

1438
01:43:19,428 --> 01:43:21,555
Shopping? Why with these fellows?

1439
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:26,399
She says we are all friends.

1440
01:43:26,535 --> 01:43:28,901
Do you need friends like them?

1441
01:43:29,338 --> 01:43:31,272
Go shopping with Sheela or grandma.

1442
01:43:31,340 --> 01:43:33,399
Why with these fellows?

1443
01:43:40,382 --> 01:43:43,510
She says she knows what
kind of friends to choose.

1444
01:43:43,652 --> 01:43:45,347
You don't have to say anything.

1445
01:43:45,487 --> 01:43:46,545
I should not say anything?

1446
01:43:46,689 --> 01:43:48,316
I am your guardian, mind it.

1447
01:43:54,597 --> 01:43:58,260
She says, stop
behaving like a Nutcase..

1448
01:43:58,334 --> 01:44:00,427
.. and to mind your own business.

1449
01:44:00,536 --> 01:44:02,333
Who are you calling a nutcase?

1450
01:44:02,471 --> 01:44:04,530
You. There is no doubt about that

1451
01:44:06,342 --> 01:44:08,367
Okay, I'll see.

1452
01:44:08,510 --> 01:44:09,568
You don't know about them.

1453
01:44:10,346 --> 01:44:11,472
Wait till I..

1454
01:44:17,353 --> 01:44:20,584
Why are you saying sorry?
He is like this.

1455
01:44:24,693 --> 01:44:29,494
He told us to vacate, I
told him I won't. That's why

1456
01:44:31,500 --> 01:44:33,434
Karthik is not married yet.

1457
01:44:33,502 --> 01:44:36,335
They don't rent out the space
to bachelors in your apartments

1458
01:44:40,776 --> 01:44:43,677
I said the same thing.
He refuses to get married.

1459
01:44:47,349 --> 01:44:50,341
She's asking you to
find a girl for him

1460
01:44:50,486 --> 01:44:51,544
I can..

1461
01:44:51,787 --> 01:44:56,588
But he has an image
of a girl in his mind.

1462
01:45:00,329 --> 01:45:01,421
Tell her straight

1463
01:45:04,466 --> 01:45:05,524
She should be well read.

1464
01:45:06,769 --> 01:45:11,604
She should be brave.
Independent thinking.

1465
01:45:13,342 --> 01:45:15,276
If she was all that
I just described..

1466
01:45:15,344 --> 01:45:16,902
..she'll be beautiful to me

1467
01:45:24,353 --> 01:45:25,411
What

1468
01:45:31,493 --> 01:45:32,790
What is she saying?

1469
01:45:32,995 --> 01:45:36,328
She is asking if that
girl should know music

1470
01:45:39,335 --> 01:45:40,393
Not necessary

1471
01:45:41,503 --> 01:45:43,334
If I find the girl I want,

1472
01:45:43,472 --> 01:45:46,999
the life I lead with
her will be happy.

1473
01:45:48,677 --> 01:45:51,339
That happiness will
give me good music.

1474
01:45:52,514 --> 01:45:55,574
She only needs to be an
inspiration for my music.

1475
01:45:57,786 --> 01:46:01,722
If she understands me, she
will understand my music as well.

1476
01:46:03,525 --> 01:46:05,425
You might as well
have told her straight

1477
01:46:26,348 --> 01:46:27,406
Hey, Archana..

1478
01:46:27,483 --> 01:46:28,541
Come in

1479
01:46:31,420 --> 01:46:32,478
Sit down.

1480
01:46:36,792 --> 01:46:37,816
Cake.

1481
01:46:38,494 --> 01:46:39,586
You made it?

1482
01:47:00,449 --> 01:47:01,541
It's like Music.

1483
01:47:05,354 --> 01:47:06,480
What is music like?

1484
01:47:08,624 --> 01:47:10,387
Like this cake!

1485
01:47:19,334 --> 01:47:20,392
Come here

1486
01:47:33,348 --> 01:47:35,373
Place you palms on these speakers.

1487
01:47:35,517 --> 01:47:37,678
Your palms, on these speakers.

1488
01:47:40,689 --> 01:47:44,318
Now there will be music.
I composed it.

1489
01:47:44,493 --> 01:47:46,586
Watch my hands carefully.

1490
01:47:46,662 --> 01:47:52,498
Okay? 1.. 2.. 3.

1491
01:49:34,336 --> 01:49:35,428
Yes!

1492
01:49:38,674 --> 01:49:39,732
That's it, Archana.

1493
01:49:45,347 --> 01:49:48,339
I know it Archana. I
know you can feel music.

1494
01:49:49,351 --> 01:49:54,516
The Music in the air, you could
see right? Understand it right?

1495
01:49:55,324 --> 01:49:58,316
The same way, you
will understand my mind.

1496
01:50:01,496 --> 01:50:04,590
I want to marry you

1497
01:50:08,337 --> 01:50:09,463
Will you marry me?

1498
01:50:13,508 --> 01:50:14,634
Tell me Archana

1499
01:50:23,485 --> 01:50:24,577
Archana.

1500
01:50:27,322 --> 01:50:29,517
Yes, I am your friend.

1501
01:50:29,925 --> 01:50:32,792
Even after we are married, I
will be a good friend to you.

1502
01:50:35,330 --> 01:50:36,388
Why can't you?

1503
01:50:40,902 --> 01:50:43,666
Your world is different..
Don't say that Archana!

1504
01:50:43,772 --> 01:50:47,606
Take me into your world.
We'll live happily. Trust me..

1505
01:51:42,497 --> 01:51:43,623
What else did she say?

1506
01:51:43,765 --> 01:51:46,791
'I can't marry anyone.
My world is different.

1507
01:51:46,968 --> 01:51:48,868
Nobody else can belong there',
is what she said.

1508
01:51:50,338 --> 01:51:53,273
She said that she
could not hear my music..

1509
01:51:53,341 --> 01:51:55,502
.. and she would not either.

1510
01:51:55,644 --> 01:51:56,668
This is what I said

1511
01:51:56,778 --> 01:51:57,836
Why do you need this?

1512
01:51:57,913 --> 01:52:00,609
No. She asked me
what music was like.

1513
01:52:01,483 --> 01:52:02,780
She really understood my music.

1514
01:52:03,452 --> 01:52:05,352
Even when I
stopped moving my hands..

1515
01:52:05,420 --> 01:52:07,320
..she still followed the music.

1516
01:52:08,690 --> 01:52:12,421
So I felt like
telling her and I did.

1517
01:52:12,594 --> 01:52:14,255
Am not saying it was wrong..

1518
01:52:14,329 --> 01:52:17,423
..but she seems to hate marriage.

1519
01:52:17,599 --> 01:52:20,568
She fears it. Even I
can't understand why.

1520
01:52:20,702 --> 01:52:21,760
Merely speaking about it angers her.

1521
01:52:21,870 --> 01:52:23,895
Archana is a nice girl.

1522
01:52:23,972 --> 01:52:25,530
But anger isn't good for a home.

1523
01:52:25,607 --> 01:52:26,665
Listen..

1524
01:52:26,742 --> 01:52:28,334
.. let this be..

1525
01:52:28,477 --> 01:52:30,672
..there is so much
more to do in life!

1526
01:52:31,513 --> 01:52:32,639
What Viji says is right.

1527
01:52:32,781 --> 01:52:35,545
Forgiving you last time
was itself a big thing.

1528
01:52:35,684 --> 01:52:37,345
I don't think it'll happen again.

1529
01:52:37,486 --> 01:52:38,544
I can't leave it like that

1530
01:52:38,687 --> 01:52:39,779
You'll apologize again?

1531
01:52:39,888 --> 01:52:42,322
Why should I? What did I do wrong?

1532
01:52:42,491 --> 01:52:43,515
Listen!
- I can't!

1533
01:52:44,493 --> 01:52:45,619
Sorry!

1534
01:53:09,985 --> 01:53:11,509
Its ok. Please be here

1535
01:53:13,321 --> 01:53:14,413
What did I do wrong?

1536
01:53:14,623 --> 01:53:16,318
I said I wanted to marry you.

1537
01:53:16,424 --> 01:53:17,482
Why are you so angry about that?

1538
01:53:18,326 --> 01:53:19,418
No, talk to me

1539
01:53:21,496 --> 01:53:22,588
Say something, Archana

1540
01:53:30,505 --> 01:53:31,631
I don't understand

1541
01:53:37,679 --> 01:53:39,613
I've already told you everything.

1542
01:53:40,348 --> 01:53:41,440
I will tell you again..

1543
01:53:44,519 --> 01:53:46,714
.. I don't want to see you.

1544
01:53:49,491 --> 01:53:50,583
Get out of my life!

1545
01:54:28,330 --> 01:54:29,661
Have you gone mad?

1546
01:54:29,731 --> 01:54:31,358
You are going overboard.

1547
01:54:31,600 --> 01:54:34,000
Is it wrong to propose to you?

1548
01:54:35,503 --> 01:54:37,630
So what if he asks you?

1549
01:54:42,544 --> 01:54:44,375
Is this a reason?

1550
01:54:44,479 --> 01:54:46,606
Karthik doesn't
expect you to know music.

1551
01:54:50,352 --> 01:54:51,478
Why won't you get married?
Give me reason

1552
01:54:57,592 --> 01:54:59,526
Karthik doesn't
think of you as a burden.

1553
01:54:59,694 --> 01:55:00,718
He has so much affection for you.

1554
01:55:03,331 --> 01:55:04,423
He won't change

1555
01:55:09,337 --> 01:55:12,568
Just because your father changed
doesn't mean everyone else will.

1556
01:55:15,610 --> 01:55:17,510
Ok I don't understand.
So please explain.

1557
01:55:17,979 --> 01:55:19,810
Is this how you want to be
for the rest of your life?

1558
01:55:22,784 --> 01:55:23,910
Why?

1559
01:55:40,502 --> 01:55:41,764
Why are you saying that?

1560
01:55:42,337 --> 01:55:45,966
Why do you think the child
you've will also be like you?

1561
01:55:49,344 --> 01:55:53,542
But that was two generations back..

1562
01:55:53,615 --> 01:55:54,673
..that doesn't mean..

1563
01:55:56,351 --> 01:55:58,376
If it does happen..

1564
01:56:14,336 --> 01:56:15,428
What Archana?

1565
01:56:26,681 --> 01:56:27,739
What help?

1566
01:56:31,486 --> 01:56:32,544
Tell Karthik?

1567
01:56:34,322 --> 01:56:35,414
What?

1568
01:56:46,601 --> 01:56:49,536
Karthik can like anybody and
marry anybody if he wants.

1569
01:56:51,339 --> 01:56:54,968
But I have neither the
intention nor the need for it.

1570
01:57:11,393 --> 01:57:14,487
He doesn't have to see me,
or wait for me either.

1571
01:57:15,330 --> 01:57:18,766
Tell him to marry
someone else and be happy.

1572
01:57:38,353 --> 01:57:42,687
I have never seen her
cry in all these years.

1573
01:57:44,492 --> 01:57:47,586
This was the first time
I saw tears in her eyes

1574
01:57:50,331 --> 01:57:54,665
Okay, Sheela. If that's what
she wants, I have to respect it

1575
01:57:55,403 --> 01:57:58,634
That doesn't mean I'll
forget her and marry someone else.

1576
01:57:59,340 --> 01:58:00,773
I just won't disturb her.

1577
01:58:02,343 --> 01:58:03,503
I won't come in her way.

1578
01:58:21,329 --> 01:58:28,599
''Oh silent one The
portrait with talking eyes''

1579
01:58:28,770 --> 01:58:36,609
''The child woman My darling chaos''

1580
01:58:36,778 --> 01:58:40,339
''I plucked the heart like a flower''

1581
01:58:40,482 --> 01:58:44,919
''And used my nerves to make a bower''

1582
01:58:44,986 --> 01:58:48,319
''I handed them
over to you, dear one''

1583
01:58:48,490 --> 01:58:52,324
And, you stamped over it, girl.

1584
01:58:52,927 --> 01:59:01,426
''Oh silent one The
portrait with talking eyes''

1585
01:59:24,926 --> 01:59:29,329
The rainbow started crying as
soon as it finished filling..

1586
01:59:29,397 --> 01:59:32,730
..the seven colors in it.

1587
01:59:33,268 --> 01:59:36,863
Will you be able to see it again?

1588
01:59:41,009 --> 01:59:48,745
In the mind of the girl,
your life ended up in confusion.

1589
01:59:49,417 --> 01:59:52,750
The sky is shocked
in half dizziness.

1590
01:59:53,488 --> 01:59:56,980
I cried calling for my love.

1591
01:59:57,492 --> 02:00:01,656
You are shaken up
thinking that life is revenge.

1592
02:00:01,729 --> 02:00:05,324
I had plucked the
flowers for your worship.

1593
02:00:05,466 --> 02:00:08,993
You are frightened it
is killing the flowers.

1594
02:00:09,337 --> 02:00:16,869
I loved you with my words. You
killed me with your illusions.

1595
02:00:17,278 --> 02:00:24,810
I just asked for the rain, you
gave me thunders and lightening.

1596
02:00:25,353 --> 02:00:32,725
''Oh silent one The
portrait with talking eyes''

1597
02:01:05,293 --> 02:01:13,257
''The fire is also a beauty in
the forest of bamboo shoots.''

1598
02:01:13,534 --> 02:01:17,402
But, I never enjoyed them.

1599
02:01:21,342 --> 02:01:29,408
My heart just can't bear this.
In your anger, you are a beauty.

1600
02:01:29,550 --> 02:01:37,389
But, I can't enjoy it. Dear one,
my heart can't tolerate this.

1601
02:01:37,492 --> 02:01:41,326
''Seeing your state, my heart
is beating outside my body.''

1602
02:01:41,596 --> 02:01:43,461
''As your heart has
torn into two pieces..

1603
02:01:43,531 --> 02:01:45,465
..my heart has torn
into four pieces.''

1604
02:01:45,600 --> 02:01:49,331
''If the seed is broken,
a plant is grown.. ''

1605
02:01:49,470 --> 02:01:57,002
''If the heart is broken,
grass only will grow.''

1606
02:01:57,345 --> 02:02:04,808
''What is a punishment in
comparison to your silence?''

1607
02:02:06,821 --> 02:02:09,688
Shall we eat something?
- I am not hungry

1608
02:02:09,724 --> 02:02:11,692
Then you eat, I just
want some Coffee..

1609
02:02:12,894 --> 02:02:14,327
HI.
- HI. Viji..

1610
02:02:15,463 --> 02:02:16,521
I'll be upstairs

1611
02:02:19,334 --> 02:02:22,861
He's like that only. Okay, carry on.

1612
02:02:22,937 --> 02:02:24,404
Bye.
- Bye.

1613
02:02:31,813 --> 02:02:33,804
What is this? You just left abruptly

1614
02:02:34,349 --> 02:02:35,475
What else should I have done?

1615
02:02:35,550 --> 02:02:36,949
You could have said Hello

1616
02:02:37,552 --> 02:02:38,746
Why? Didn't she clearly state..

1617
02:02:38,820 --> 02:02:41,015
..that I should not
see her or talk to her

1618
02:02:41,522 --> 02:02:43,319
Look here. She may have just
said that in anger.. - No.

1619
02:02:44,292 --> 02:02:45,384
Remember the happiness in her eyes..

1620
02:02:45,893 --> 02:02:47,861
when she saw that
locket at the restaurant.

1621
02:02:48,596 --> 02:02:49,927
I gave it to her without her asking.

1622
02:02:51,999 --> 02:02:59,929
Today she has asked for this.
Its better I give this to her

1623
02:03:59,534 --> 02:04:02,264
What? What did you want to tell me?

1624
02:04:02,336 --> 02:04:03,598
Am feeling shy..

1625
02:04:04,405 --> 02:04:05,463
What is it?

1626
02:04:06,274 --> 02:04:08,936
Its nothing. You
shouldn't laugh at me..

1627
02:04:09,944 --> 02:04:11,002
Ok, tell me

1628
02:04:12,613 --> 02:04:17,812
The bulb glowed for me as
well.. even the bell rang.

1629
02:04:22,890 --> 02:04:24,380
See you're laughing

1630
02:04:24,492 --> 02:04:26,858
Ok. Who is it?

1631
02:04:28,596 --> 02:04:29,654
Sheela.

1632
02:04:31,265 --> 02:04:32,323
Sheela?

1633
02:04:33,868 --> 02:04:34,994
When did this happen?

1634
02:04:37,004 --> 02:04:40,337
Yesterday, in the shopping mall

1635
02:04:41,342 --> 02:04:45,802
..I thought about it
at first, then I decided

1636
02:04:45,880 --> 02:04:46,938
Decided what?

1637
02:04:47,815 --> 02:04:48,941
To marry her

1638
02:04:53,621 --> 02:04:56,419
I am so happy. You
have such large heart

1639
02:04:57,892 --> 02:04:58,984
Nothing of that sort.

1640
02:04:59,594 --> 02:05:00,652
I am not giving her a life..

1641
02:05:00,728 --> 02:05:01,990
..just sharing mine
with her, like you said

1642
02:05:04,932 --> 02:05:08,925
Ok let's get to work. We
should first tell Sheela this

1643
02:05:10,471 --> 02:05:14,339
I know you feel awkward about it.
Don't worry -I will speak to her

1644
02:05:14,408 --> 02:05:18,606
Hey Viji, You think I
won't do this for you?

1645
02:05:19,413 --> 02:05:21,347
Not that. I already spoke to her.

1646
02:05:22,817 --> 02:05:23,943
When?

1647
02:05:24,552 --> 02:05:25,746
This morning at the church

1648
02:05:29,290 --> 02:05:30,780
Hold on! License check

1649
02:05:30,892 --> 02:05:31,916
It's you!

1650
02:05:32,593 --> 02:05:33,651
Coming from the church?

1651
02:05:33,728 --> 02:05:35,252
Wow what gave it away?

1652
02:05:35,329 --> 02:05:36,591
You have started talking like me

1653
02:05:37,265 --> 02:05:39,859
It's infectious. How
come you are here?

1654
02:05:40,401 --> 02:05:41,925
Just that I had no
recordings today. Felt bored.

1655
02:05:42,270 --> 02:05:44,932
So I thought I will meet
you and ask you to marry me!

1656
02:05:46,274 --> 02:05:47,400
Why are you so shocked?

1657
02:05:47,808 --> 02:05:50,936
Ok let me get right to the
point. I wish to marry you.

1658
02:05:51,445 --> 02:05:53,606
You know about me. I play
the keyboard, earn well.

1659
02:05:53,681 --> 02:05:55,774
Have already gotten
my sister married.

1660
02:05:55,850 --> 02:05:57,613
So it's only me and
my mom. I am free.

1661
02:05:57,885 --> 02:05:59,284
Other than that I've an
occasional beer on Beethoven..

1662
02:05:59,353 --> 02:06:01,878
..or Michael Jackson's
birthday? Any problem?

1663
02:06:06,327 --> 02:06:11,390
So suddenly. You
know about me, right?..

1664
02:06:11,599 --> 02:06:13,658
I know. What about it?

1665
02:06:13,868 --> 02:06:16,393
I am not concerned about your past.

1666
02:06:16,470 --> 02:06:18,404
It could happen to anyone.

1667
02:06:18,472 --> 02:06:20,872
Even I could not walk for
around a year and a half!

1668
02:06:21,275 --> 02:06:22,537
People had to carry me around.

1669
02:06:22,877 --> 02:06:24,811
Yes. But I was a baby then

1670
02:06:28,282 --> 02:06:29,874
Okay, jokes apart.

1671
02:06:29,951 --> 02:06:32,749
I've told you what I needed
to say, now it's your turn.

1672
02:06:36,624 --> 02:06:38,592
Is this how you really spoke?
- Yes.

1673
02:06:38,693 --> 02:06:39,717
So what did she say?

1674
02:06:39,794 --> 02:06:41,261
First she was scared,
stared around a bit,..

1675
02:06:41,329 --> 02:06:44,787
..then asked me to
speak to her parents

1676
02:06:45,399 --> 02:06:50,268
Great. But please don't
speak to her parents like this.

1677
02:06:50,338 --> 02:06:51,532
I already spoke to them too.

1678
02:06:52,273 --> 02:06:53,399
When did this happen?

1679
02:06:54,275 --> 02:06:56,869
I went straight to her house
- What did they say?

1680
02:07:00,948 --> 02:07:04,008
What is this? Is this is a
general family reaction?

1681
02:07:05,019 --> 02:07:08,887
It's totally unexpected.
We don't know what to say

1682
02:07:09,523 --> 02:07:10,683
Don't misunderstand my asking.

1683
02:07:10,891 --> 02:07:13,325
Do you've issues
with her marrying again?

1684
02:07:14,261 --> 02:07:15,592
Nothing of that sort.

1685
02:07:15,663 --> 02:07:18,928
I pray everyday that
something like this should happen.

1686
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:20,729
Do let me know.

1687
02:07:21,535 --> 02:07:22,593
I won't press you to
tell me tomorrow..

1688
02:07:22,670 --> 02:07:24,001
..you can even tell me today

1689
02:07:25,272 --> 02:07:26,534
Are you married already or ..

1690
02:07:26,607 --> 02:07:28,006
Not yet!

1691
02:07:28,476 --> 02:07:30,273
They asked me if they
can have a church wedding.

1692
02:07:30,344 --> 02:07:33,279
People get married in
all sorts of places..

1693
02:07:33,347 --> 02:07:35,542
.. a church is
perfectly fine for me!

1694
02:07:35,816 --> 02:07:37,283
I'll tell you something beautiful..

1695
02:07:37,351 --> 02:07:40,616
..I told my mother yesterday.

1696
02:07:41,622 --> 02:07:43,522
I was wondering how she would react.

1697
02:07:43,724 --> 02:07:44,884
Do you know what she did

1698
02:07:45,593 --> 02:07:48,790
She looked at me for a bit and
then kissed me on my forehead.

1699
02:07:50,464 --> 02:07:53,865
She used to kiss me on my
forehead before going to school.

1700
02:07:54,802 --> 02:07:57,794
After all those years,
only now.. I got goose bumps.

1701
02:07:58,939 --> 02:08:01,271
Having lost her
husband early in her life..

1702
02:08:01,342 --> 02:08:03,333
..she could understand Sheela well.

1703
02:08:03,611 --> 02:08:05,272
It was so touching.

1704
02:08:08,416 --> 02:08:09,474
So when is the wedding?

1705
02:08:10,818 --> 02:08:11,944
Lets see.

1706
02:08:13,888 --> 02:08:15,617
What?

1707
02:08:15,690 --> 02:08:17,282
So we can fix it anytime,..

1708
02:08:17,324 --> 02:08:19,884
..but I asked it to be
put off by a bit. - Why?

1709
02:08:21,595 --> 02:08:23,460
Let things sort themselves out
with you, when can have it then

1710
02:08:25,332 --> 02:08:26,731
I know what you're talking about

1711
02:08:27,268 --> 02:08:29,395
That's a closed chapter.
It's my problem.

1712
02:08:29,470 --> 02:08:30,994
Life doesn't end here.

1713
02:08:31,806 --> 02:08:34,274
Moreover if you get married now..

1714
02:08:34,341 --> 02:08:36,275
..it'll be a
welcome diversion for me.

1715
02:08:36,610 --> 02:08:38,009
Do that for me at least

1716
02:08:38,345 --> 02:08:39,403
No, Karthik.

1717
02:08:39,480 --> 02:08:40,811
Hey, Viji.. please.

1718
02:08:43,551 --> 02:08:44,609
Okay.

1719
02:09:07,541 --> 02:09:08,599
What did she say?

1720
02:09:08,809 --> 02:09:11,277
She is talking about the
way you proposed to me

1721
02:09:11,345 --> 02:09:14,405
Even I am shocked.

1722
02:09:14,615 --> 02:09:16,606
Got to know the
result within the day's..

1723
02:09:16,684 --> 02:09:18,618
..play like in a One Day match

1724
02:09:21,288 --> 02:09:23,279
People all around have
been waiting for years,..

1725
02:09:23,324 --> 02:09:25,292
..having changed names,
identities, cities..

1726
02:09:25,326 --> 02:09:26,657
..and even languages just for this!

1727
02:09:30,664 --> 02:09:31,858
Did I say so something wrong?

1728
02:09:39,440 --> 02:09:41,340
Yeah she is a great girl.

1729
02:09:41,408 --> 02:09:43,467
But ask for her license,
and she gets angry.

1730
02:09:47,548 --> 02:09:50,415
Me? Thank you. But Archana,

1731
02:09:50,618 --> 02:09:52,882
Karthik is much nicer than me.

1732
02:09:56,590 --> 02:10:00,253
When your friend finds herself
a life, aren't you so joyous;..

1733
02:10:00,327 --> 02:10:03,262
..in the same way,
won't I be ..joyous..

1734
02:10:03,330 --> 02:10:07,266
..if the same
happened with my friend

1735
02:10:08,602 --> 02:10:11,537
We would all be overjoyed

1736
02:10:24,819 --> 02:10:28,311
Tried a serious role for a change
- not working at all!

1737
02:10:36,797 --> 02:10:37,923
I don't understand

1738
02:10:38,599 --> 02:10:39,657
What don't you understand?

1739
02:10:40,668 --> 02:10:42,795
Archana and Karthik
are getting married

1740
02:10:43,404 --> 02:10:46,931
No that's what we want. We
will make sure it comes true

1741
02:10:47,274 --> 02:10:48,332
Yes

1742
02:10:48,609 --> 02:10:51,874
But they've fought and are
not talking to each other?!

1743
02:10:51,946 --> 02:10:53,277
Yes!

1744
02:10:54,014 --> 02:10:55,345
Are you drunk?

1745
02:10:56,016 --> 02:10:57,278
What do you mean?

1746
02:10:57,551 --> 02:10:59,348
If Archana has to get married,
won't I find her a boy?

1747
02:10:59,420 --> 02:11:00,478
Who? You?

1748
02:11:00,521 --> 02:11:01,613
The last time you found a boy,..

1749
02:11:01,689 --> 02:11:03,281
..even his own
mother didn't like him.

1750
02:11:03,324 --> 02:11:05,884
If Archana had seen him,
she would've chased him away.

1751
02:11:06,293 --> 02:11:08,386
So, you'll get her
married to Karthik?

1752
02:11:08,462 --> 02:11:09,861
Why, what's wrong with that?

1753
02:11:09,930 --> 02:11:11,397
Do you know he is a drunkard?

1754
02:11:11,599 --> 02:11:13,260
Who is a drunkard?
Maybe one day he may have..

1755
02:11:13,334 --> 02:11:14,528
You keep quiet.

1756
02:11:15,269 --> 02:11:16,327
You also drank.

1757
02:11:16,537 --> 02:11:18,266
At Jayaram's wedding,
you were drunk..

1758
02:11:18,339 --> 02:11:19,465
..and lying sprawled in the kitchen!

1759
02:11:19,540 --> 02:11:20,598
When did this happen?

1760
02:11:20,674 --> 02:11:21,732
Didn't you know?!

1761
02:11:24,278 --> 02:11:25,745
You are talking unnecessarily.

1762
02:11:26,614 --> 02:11:27,876
Didn't you find any other place?

1763
02:11:27,948 --> 02:11:29,609
In the kitchen!!

1764
02:11:30,284 --> 02:11:32,684
Okay, control your self Janu.
Now what do you both want?

1765
02:11:33,721 --> 02:11:34,881
Look here..

1766
02:11:35,422 --> 02:11:37,890
I'm not asking you to
conduct this wedding

1767
02:11:37,925 --> 02:11:39,893
I believe it'll happen for sure.

1768
02:11:39,927 --> 02:11:42,259
But when it does, and I
see you interfering,..

1769
02:11:42,329 --> 02:11:45,321
..I'll end your life
with my bare hands.

1770
02:12:42,623 --> 02:12:44,887
Go give this locket to that aunty.?

1771
02:12:44,925 --> 02:12:45,983
Okay, Uncle.

1772
02:12:55,669 --> 02:12:56,931
That uncle told me to give it to you

1773
02:13:14,521 --> 02:13:15,613
Don't want!

1774
02:13:31,805 --> 02:13:35,002
Your Mother.. Where? Your Father?

1775
02:13:47,921 --> 02:13:49,013
School?

1776
02:14:53,620 --> 02:14:57,317
Babu can you come to
the hospital with me

1777
02:14:58,292 --> 02:14:59,316
What happened sir?

1778
02:14:59,593 --> 02:15:02,994
My son has met with accident.

1779
02:15:05,265 --> 02:15:06,527
I just got a call.

1780
02:15:07,868 --> 02:15:12,328
He always wears a helmet. He
seems to have forgotten today.

1781
02:15:12,940 --> 02:15:14,931
The Corporation lorry
crashed straight into him it seems.

1782
02:15:16,877 --> 02:15:20,608
My wife doesn't know yet.
She wont be able to bear it.

1783
02:15:21,281 --> 02:15:24,409
Was preparing for
the IIT entrance exam.

1784
02:15:25,752 --> 02:15:29,313
Even now he had gone to a
Friend's house to pick up notes.

1785
02:15:29,623 --> 02:15:32,319
I even told him, not
to go out so late..

1786
02:15:32,392 --> 02:15:34,326
..to wait till the morning.

1787
02:15:34,595 --> 02:15:38,258
He had said that the exam
was very important to him,..

1788
02:15:38,332 --> 02:15:42,860
..and he wanted to get
good marks and a good rank.

1789
02:15:45,005 --> 02:15:46,336
Very ambitious boy.

1790
02:15:49,276 --> 02:15:50,675
They say it's a head injury.

1791
02:15:51,812 --> 02:15:53,006
Body seems unhurt.

1792
02:15:53,280 --> 02:15:56,807
Can you come with me to
the hospital, Babu? Please.

1793
02:16:00,287 --> 02:16:02,881
Your son met with an accident
and died on the Spot damn it!

1794
02:16:03,991 --> 02:16:07,984
He died in the year 1984,
it's been 20 years since!

1795
02:16:08,262 --> 02:16:10,321
We are in 2007 now. MGR is dead,

1796
02:16:10,397 --> 02:16:13,332
Indira Gandhi is
dead and so is your son!

1797
02:16:13,400 --> 02:16:15,265
You Bloody Fool! Are
you not educated?!

1798
02:16:15,335 --> 02:16:18,270
Your Azharuddin,
Computers are all ancient now.

1799
02:16:19,273 --> 02:16:20,331
Look there.

1800
02:16:20,407 --> 02:16:22,534
Your wife! Do you
know why she is crying?

1801
02:16:23,810 --> 02:16:26,005
She's not crying for your dead son.

1802
02:16:26,413 --> 02:16:27,471
She's crying for you, damn it..

1803
02:16:27,548 --> 02:16:28,879
.. she doesn't even know if
her husband's normal or insane.

1804
02:16:28,949 --> 02:16:32,544
Your babu is dead!
Damn it. He is dead.

1805
02:16:32,619 --> 02:16:34,712
If you want, take me as your son.

1806
02:16:34,821 --> 02:16:39,724
Cry. Cry your heart out!

1807
02:16:39,793 --> 02:16:46,926
Cry, man.. cry. Cry.. cry.. cry.

1808
02:17:20,334 --> 02:17:21,392
I am sorry.

1809
02:17:22,869 --> 02:17:23,927
Why sir?

1810
02:17:24,605 --> 02:17:25,731
For all that happened!

1811
02:17:29,276 --> 02:17:31,676
Some things take
some time to understand.

1812
02:17:32,813 --> 02:17:33,939
I have understood only now!

1813
02:17:35,882 --> 02:17:37,406
Archana will also understand.

1814
02:17:38,752 --> 02:17:39,810
She will.

1815
02:17:40,821 --> 02:17:42,311
Just felt like telling you

1816
02:17:43,890 --> 02:17:45,585
Hello there. One minute

1817
02:17:49,429 --> 02:17:51,659
Congratulations!
- Thank you, sir.

1818
02:17:52,599 --> 02:17:54,931
After marriage he
wants to move in here.

1819
02:17:55,002 --> 02:17:57,800
Oh! Excellent. You are most welcome.

1820
02:17:58,772 --> 02:17:59,830
Will you call me for the wedding?

1821
02:17:59,906 --> 02:18:01,464
The first invite will be yours

1822
02:18:01,541 --> 02:18:02,599
Okay.. okay.

1823
02:18:08,815 --> 02:18:10,282
Hey come..

1824
02:18:14,288 --> 02:18:15,414
How come suddenly?

1825
02:18:17,324 --> 02:18:18,382
What are you looking at?

1826
02:18:25,332 --> 02:18:26,390
What is this?

1827
02:18:35,609 --> 02:18:36,667
What is all this?

1828
02:18:38,278 --> 02:18:39,336
A gift?

1829
02:18:42,883 --> 02:18:44,282
Why are you giving it now?

1830
02:18:44,418 --> 02:18:45,544
Come to the wedding
and give it yourself

1831
02:18:59,499 --> 02:19:01,990
Hey? What's happened to you?

1832
02:19:10,677 --> 02:19:12,736
You wont come for the wedding? Why?

1833
02:19:18,552 --> 02:19:19,814
Of course everybody will be there

1834
02:19:24,491 --> 02:19:25,719
Is this because
Karthik will be there?

1835
02:19:30,797 --> 02:19:33,527
What are you talking about?
What can Karthik do to you?

1836
02:19:33,734 --> 02:19:35,463
There is nothing
between you guys, right?

1837
02:19:39,773 --> 02:19:40,865
Why can't you see him?

1838
02:19:46,613 --> 02:19:47,671
What do you mean Understand?

1839
02:19:47,748 --> 02:19:49,272
You may have a hundred problems,..

1840
02:19:49,349 --> 02:19:51,340
..that doesn't mean you
don't come for my wedding.

1841
02:19:57,791 --> 02:19:59,486
Here. Keep this.

1842
02:19:59,893 --> 02:20:02,259
If you want to give it to
me. Give it at the wedding

1843
02:20:05,265 --> 02:20:07,256
Listen. If you don't
come for my wedding,..

1844
02:20:07,334 --> 02:20:09,859
..I don't want to
see you ever again.

1845
02:20:24,284 --> 02:20:26,548
What do you mean by just
walking out? Is that all?

1846
02:20:26,720 --> 02:20:28,017
Are you coming for
the wedding or not?

1847
02:21:06,393 --> 02:21:08,258
If this remains with me,
it won't be a violin..

1848
02:21:08,328 --> 02:21:09,386
..it'll just be a piece of soap.

1849
02:21:11,598 --> 02:21:14,260
Apparently you said you won't
come for Sheela's wedding. Why?

1850
02:21:16,603 --> 02:21:17,661
Why?

1851
02:21:25,545 --> 02:21:26,603
Just because I will be there?

1852
02:21:27,614 --> 02:21:29,878
Have I disturbed you
even once since that day?

1853
02:21:30,417 --> 02:21:33,318
I stayed away thinking, even
seeing me could cause you pain.

1854
02:21:33,720 --> 02:21:35,711
You have made me seem
like a cheap Roadside Rogue.

1855
02:21:37,591 --> 02:21:39,718
You not coming to the
wedding because of me is a LIE.

1856
02:21:40,260 --> 02:21:41,784
You are afraid of yourself.

1857
02:21:41,928 --> 02:21:44,863
But you pretend you're not.
That's the biggest problem.

1858
02:21:46,933 --> 02:21:49,993
All are affectionate with you.
It's you who doesn't understand.

1859
02:21:50,804 --> 02:21:53,329
Many people hate life
and kill themselves.

1860
02:21:53,740 --> 02:21:55,605
You're the only one who has
killed Life and continues living.

1861
02:22:01,014 --> 02:22:07,886
How are you able to pretend
being dumb to your own self? Sorry..

1862
02:22:09,523 --> 02:22:10,581
I am telling you for the last time.

1863
02:22:10,690 --> 02:22:12,521
You won't face any
problems because of me.

1864
02:22:12,792 --> 02:22:14,919
If you trust yourself, then come..!

1865
02:22:16,763 --> 02:22:18,856
If in spite of this you
don't turn up ..then..

1866
02:22:47,460 --> 02:22:51,794
I can see the desire to Live
in your eyes. Why deny yourself?

1867
02:22:54,401 --> 02:22:55,459
Why won't you give Life a chance?

1868
02:22:56,403 --> 02:22:57,597
Trust me, you won't lose.

1869
02:22:59,673 --> 02:23:00,799
What is your fear, Archana?

1870
02:23:01,975 --> 02:23:03,806
That you will have a child
and it'll turn out like you.

1871
02:23:03,877 --> 02:23:05,606
Is that all?

1872
02:23:07,447 --> 02:23:10,883
If such a thing happens I will
not run away like your father did.

1873
02:23:12,819 --> 02:23:14,480
I will bring my child
up like my own life.

1874
02:23:16,923 --> 02:23:19,721
Some things in life you have
to trust, without questioning.

1875
02:23:22,762 --> 02:23:25,253
Someday you will
realize you were wrong,..

1876
02:23:25,332 --> 02:23:28,267
..but it may be too
late to set it right!

1877
02:23:31,671 --> 02:23:36,938
I loved your silence as
much as I loved my music.

1878
02:23:43,617 --> 02:23:45,016
But it's you..
- ..it's you who made me cry!

1879
02:25:11,938 --> 02:25:16,272
My dear Bride and Groom

1880
02:25:16,543 --> 02:25:21,674
In the August presence of the
holy fathers and invited guests

1881
02:25:21,781 --> 02:25:23,749
You're here to seek
the blessings of god

1882
02:25:23,817 --> 02:25:25,751
Jesus is
wholeheartedly blessing your love

1883
02:25:25,819 --> 02:25:29,721
He has already blessed
you after your baptism

1884
02:25:29,823 --> 02:25:32,690
Now through the
divine path of marriage

1885
02:25:32,726 --> 02:25:37,254
He's encouraging you to untidily..

1886
02:25:37,330 --> 02:25:42,324
..shoulder the
responsibility of life

1887
02:25:42,402 --> 02:25:46,600
Now I ask your consent
in this divine place

1888
02:25:47,273 --> 02:25:50,265
Have you both come here
to marry wholeheartedly..

1889
02:25:50,343 --> 02:25:52,277
..without anyone's compulsion?

1890
02:25:52,345 --> 02:25:54,336
Hasn't Archana come?
- Don't know

1891
02:25:55,548 --> 02:25:58,278
Are you ready to love each
other for the entire life time..

1892
02:25:58,351 --> 02:26:01,912
..forgetting all
your woes and defects?

1893
02:26:02,021 --> 02:26:07,721
Karthik, look there.

1894
02:26:07,794 --> 02:26:09,261
Will you grow the bonding and..

1895
02:26:09,329 --> 02:26:12,321
..love for the common people
accepting The Christ's orders?

1896
02:26:12,398 --> 02:26:13,797
Yes, we shall.

1897
02:26:13,867 --> 02:26:14,993
- Your wedding..

1898
02:26:43,429 --> 02:26:44,589
Vijay Kumar, that's me..

1899
02:26:44,664 --> 02:26:45,790
Vijay Kumar, that's me.

1900
02:26:46,266 --> 02:26:47,927
Angeline Sheela which is you

1901
02:26:48,001 --> 02:26:49,263
Angeline Sheela which is you..

1902
02:26:49,335 --> 02:26:51,462
..am accepting you as my wife.

1903
02:26:52,806 --> 02:26:54,865
..am accepting you as my wife.

1904
02:26:55,809 --> 02:26:57,276
In all my happy days and sorrows..

1905
02:26:57,343 --> 02:26:58,537
In all my happy days and sorrows..

1906
02:26:58,611 --> 02:27:00,272
..with my body and soul..

1907
02:27:00,346 --> 02:27:01,870
..with my body and soul..

1908
02:27:02,348 --> 02:27:04,407
..I shall take care of you
for the entire lifetime.

1909
02:27:04,484 --> 02:27:05,610
..I shall take care of you
for the entire lifetime.

1910
02:27:05,685 --> 02:27:06,811
And, I promise to respect you too.

1911
02:27:06,886 --> 02:27:08,012
And, I promise to respect you too.

1912
02:27:08,321 --> 02:27:09,913
Me, Angeline Sheela..

1913
02:27:09,989 --> 02:27:11,388

May the men not disrespect
the Al might's orders. Amen!

1919
02:30:50,810 --> 02:30:56,339
''The words spoken by the
sky comes out as the rain.''

1920
02:30:56,482 --> 02:31:01,886
''The words of the rainbow
comes out as its colors.''

1921
02:31:02,422 --> 02:31:13,265
''When the truth becomes dumb,
the tears become its language.''

1922

''When the womanhood becomes dumb,
shyness becomes its language.''

''In the hours when sound sleeps,
the needles becomes the language.''

''In the heart which sleeps, even
the movements become a language.''

1925

Man doesn't need any
other language at all.''

1929
02:31:43,329 --> 02:31:48,596
The language of the wind..
Is it sound or music?

1930
02:31:49,936 --> 02:32:01,575
The language of flower.. Is
it the color or its scent?

1931
02:32:01,848 --> 02:32:11,917
''The language of sea, is it
the waves or the bubbles?''

1932
02:32:13,292 --> 02:32:23,429
The language of love.. is it
the eyes or the essence of it?

1933
02:32:24,770 --> 02:32:26,601
''Understand the language of pain..

1934
02:32:26,672 --> 02:32:30,608
..man doesn't require
any more languages.''

1935
02:32:31,677 --> 02:32:35,670
''Understand the language of heart..

Man doesn't need any
other language at all.
