1
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:19,469
{ MACHAAN }

2
00:01:26,052 --> 00:01:32,958
Spirit. This is the name of the
first novel of Raghunanthan.

3
00:01:33,793 --> 00:01:38,958
This is the old fashioned type writer.
lt is this which he uses for writing.

4
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:42,963
An employee of a foreign bank.
Journalist.

5
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:47,429
Director of documentaries.
Like that he was many of those.

6
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:51,638
He can write only when he drinks.

7
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:56,639
He can do anything with
love only after drinking.

8
00:01:57,617 --> 00:02:00,848
He can live only by drinking.

9
00:02:02,889 --> 00:02:06,120
He is eager to finish this novel.

10
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:11,086
Reason being the novel
will be over only when he dies.

11
00:02:11,531 --> 00:02:16,491
lt is the reflection of
his day and night.

12
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:20,169
ln a way with words he
is describing himself.

13
00:02:20,874 --> 00:02:29,179
OV Vijayan, Bob Merlin, Marcos, Maradona.
Maharajapuram Santhanam, Kunjunni sir.

14
00:02:29,382 --> 00:02:33,182
He loves all these people.
But he loves the most only himself.

15
00:02:33,386 --> 00:02:35,513
A miserable narcissist.

16
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:42,523
Yesterday night he had drunk a lot.
The glass in his hand is its continuation.

17
00:02:43,763 --> 00:02:46,698
Yesterday was his
marriage anniversary.

18
00:02:57,911 --> 00:02:59,538
Happy Anniversary!

19
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:02,374
A scene like that never
took place yesterday.

20
00:03:02,582 --> 00:03:09,784
Reason being 7 years back he
had divorced his wife Meera.

21
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:15,256
Meera is the wife of Alexander
Thirudes now. He is called as Alexe.

22
00:03:15,662 --> 00:03:21,396
Raghu has a child Aditya from Meera.
He is living with Meera.

23
00:03:21,834 --> 00:03:23,062
Cake is ready.

24
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:27,464
ls Sunny asleep?

25
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:31,338
He must be very tired. He was not
free whole day even for a minute.

26
00:03:32,245 --> 00:03:35,339
So sad. He is very fond
of sugar plum cake.

27
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:40,586
lt is days since l baked a cake.
- ls this cake actually for me?

28
00:03:41,087 --> 00:03:44,352
There were some snide sarcastic lines.
- Sorry!

29
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:48,584
Did you make fun of me?
My first marriage anniversary is today.

30
00:03:49,128 --> 00:03:52,325
Meera! Will l do like that?
l didn't even think.

31
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:54,862
l said itjust like that.
Cake alone is not enough.

32
00:03:55,134 --> 00:03:57,967
l need a glass of wine too.
Let us celebrate.

33
00:04:06,312 --> 00:04:12,114
Yesterday night till the bar closed he
sat alone and drank. That was his fate.

34
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:18,285
John! - Sir!
- Are you married?

35
00:04:18,491 --> 00:04:21,688
Yes. l have two children.

36
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:27,866
Have you ever felt like divorcing wife?

37
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:29,034
No.

38
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:33,962
l didn't mean did you take action.
Have you ever felt? - No. Why sir?

39
00:04:34,674 --> 00:04:41,978
For that you need luck.
John! Parcel a bottle of Vodga.

40
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:45,582
ls it needed? Daily if you take parcel
it'll put a hole in your pocket.

41
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:49,482
The rate is 6 times of retail price.
ls one or two pegs enough?

42
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:52,822
No. You don't bother about the price.

43
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:57,592
Even if paid it is difficult to get liver.
lt'is that liver which we're damaging by drinking.

44
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:00,159
Then what is this?
You get the bottle.

45
00:05:00,366 --> 00:05:04,268
l'm going to celebrate this
night and l have a reason.

46
00:05:05,371 --> 00:05:09,831
Actually l should celebrate the anniversary
when l got separated from Raghu.

47
00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:14,403
The day of liberation.

48
00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:25,521
l have always respected his intelligence.
There is no comparison between us.

49
00:05:28,561 --> 00:05:32,019
An ordinary Kolancheri Christian.
l have not grown from there.

50
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:38,103
lntelligence. That is okay. For that can
we marry a computer and lead a life?

51
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:46,544
Too much arrogance. Those days he used
to get doubly angry than what he is now.

52
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:50,715
He thinks of everything as cheap.
Except himself he doesn't love anything.

53
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:52,145
Neither does he respect any one.

54
00:05:52,418 --> 00:05:55,285
lt is some time since he has
started that English book.

55
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:58,048
He thinks of all those people who
have proved in that field as cheap.

56
00:05:58,257 --> 00:06:01,715
Arundati Roy is trash.
Arugan Thadigam is useless.

57
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:08,561
Vikas Swaroop is good for nothing.
VS Naipal not bad. Well l'll tell you something.

58
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:10,461
He is a rare breed.

59
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:24,908
ln all the seven seas Captain
Krishna Kartha has driven the ship.

60
00:06:25,184 --> 00:06:29,018
He is his neighbor.
Now he'll spoil his sleep.

61
00:06:37,296 --> 00:06:39,594
l had gone to Casaros today.

62
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:44,202
My old Maharashtra friend
and his wife are staying there.

63
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:47,567
They said you are not seen
there any more. Correct Alex.

64
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:55,112
l had gone there some
2-3 weeks back.

65
00:06:55,815 --> 00:06:58,943
You created a problem there.
They didn't say this.

66
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:06,184
Even if they say l'm not bothered.
l was drinking and enjoying.

67
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:12,397
He asked me how l'm able to mingle
freely with ex-wife and her husband.

68
00:07:13,332 --> 00:07:18,133
How is he bothered?
l abused him and kicked him.

69
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:23,808
What do these guys think?
Divorce is not such a big sin.

70
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:29,540
lt is a solution.
There is a problem.

71
00:07:30,149 --> 00:07:34,586
A problem is can't be solved how
much ever you try. Divorce solves that.

72
00:07:37,723 --> 00:07:42,057
Love, marriage and separation.

73
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:45,426
To go through all this
there is only one life.

74
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:50,162
Only when they become
memory you feel the pain.

75
00:07:52,538 --> 00:07:53,766
Do you know that captain?

76
00:07:54,707 --> 00:07:57,505
l spoilt your mood.
- No, never.

77
00:07:58,044 --> 00:08:01,343
lt is me who is spoiling
others mood today.

78
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:05,516
Take it easy.

79
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:10,781
l'm sorry. - lt is all right. Leave it.
- l'm sorry.

80
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:38,311
{ MACHAAN }

81
00:08:51,764 --> 00:08:53,561
Just turn it.
- Okay, sir!

82
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:57,498
Morning sir!
- Johnson!

83
00:08:58,237 --> 00:09:03,140
Sir! One minute. Riyaaz!
- ls this his regular seat?

84
00:09:03,776 --> 00:09:06,472
lf it is not a problem, chair is free.
- No problem.

85
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:09,914
Keep that l'll bring it for you.
- lt is alright. - Thank you!

86
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:12,146
Hello!
- Johnson!

87
00:09:29,468 --> 00:09:33,996
Vodka with water.
- Today you have show?.

88
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,037
Makes me happy.

89
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:39,939
When your show is there the people
here wants to see only Show with Spirit.

90
00:09:41,714 --> 00:09:45,548
Doing a show by having spirit
must be seen only by having spirit.

91
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:58,790
Hello, ND TV! l'm Raghunanthan.
Connect me to Ramendran.

92
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:03,632
Give the phone to Ramendran in news.
His mobile is switched off.

93
00:10:04,704 --> 00:10:08,731
Her stylish pronunciation.
l know her. You mix it.

94
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:13,644
Ramu! Didn't you send those photos?

95
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,977
The one of minister Murali Krishnan.
Send him that.

96
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:21,650
How is Delhi?
ls your fat wife fine?

97
00:10:22,521 --> 00:10:27,322
Don't tell them that l enquired.
ln ND TV news producer Ramendran.

98
00:10:27,526 --> 00:10:30,154
Very smart.
The admirer of good things.

99
00:10:33,165 --> 00:10:36,157
l can hear. Tell me.
Sir is on another call.

100
00:10:36,535 --> 00:10:40,437
l'll tell him to call you back. Okay.
- l had told.

101
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:45,506
Cabinet has been postponed
for tomorrow.

102
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:51,678
l'm going directly to news TV's studio.
Yes. What is that?

103
00:10:51,884 --> 00:10:56,685
Show The Spirit.
Yes, Raghunanthan. l know.

104
00:10:56,889 --> 00:11:01,019
l also see. Okay. After that
l'll come to the guest house.

105
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:05,186
You come there.
Okay. Madevetta!

106
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:09,192
On saying Show The Spirit
people have negative response.

107
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:11,370
lt is the experience of
those who went there.

108
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:15,368
To land in front of him is like
entering a tiger's cage.

109
00:11:15,574 --> 00:11:20,807
The questions that he asks are
dipped in chilly and very hot.

110
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:24,040
lf we decide not to go,
that is also a problem.

111
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:27,651
He'll make a special episode
saying on fear you backed out.

112
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:32,552
The programme is a live telecast.
What is the chance to outsmart him?

113
00:11:32,758 --> 00:11:36,819
This guy who has no sense
or tact is a drunkard.

114
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:40,430
Someone told me that.
- His family life is totally spoilt.

115
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:42,726
He has divorced his wife.
He had a child.

116
00:11:42,935 --> 00:11:44,994
When questioned about
that he gets upset.

117
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:49,171
Okay, if matter comes to that side,
l'll start this.

118
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,809
lt'll be over there.
His confidence will go.

119
00:11:55,681 --> 00:11:58,741
Now we'll see the programme.
l see this regularly.

120
00:11:59,752 --> 00:12:02,084
ls it Junior number one?
l'm a regular viewer of that.

121
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:06,415
Reality show?. Will anyone with
common sense see that?

122
00:12:06,792 --> 00:12:08,259
This is Show The Spirit.

123
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:13,660
l see all the episodes.
Raghunanthan. He is a smart guy.

124
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:16,357
He is our neighbor.
He isjust living opposite to us.

125
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:22,100
He is a real genius. French, Spanish,
German. He knows 5 languages.

126
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:25,004
At present he is writing a novel.
lt is in English.

127
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:31,510
All that is ok. But ladies call
him as lotus.- What lotus?

128
00:12:31,717 --> 00:12:35,175
lt is lotus which is always in water.
Full time drinker.

129
00:12:37,022 --> 00:12:41,220
lt is kitchen party's gossip. We must
learn to respect a guy's talent.

130
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:45,796
Malayali's don't have that. l wonder who
is going to be Raghu's guest today.

131
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:49,833
Minister Murali Krishnan.

132
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:58,303
Do you know who he is? He is our man.
Raghu sir. A good drunkard.

133
00:12:58,511 --> 00:13:00,809
Why are you blaming that innocent?

134
00:13:01,013 --> 00:13:04,312
l'm not blaming him.
lt is a crime only when we drink.

135
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:06,075
When a rich guy drinks it is fashion.

136
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:09,550
When they drink it is status.
We live by drinking.

137
00:13:09,755 --> 00:13:11,313
Correct. You have it.

138
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:18,658
Minister is ready.
- Tell him that king is coming.

139
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:23,660
What is this?
Don't you know how to put it?.

140
00:13:24,703 --> 00:13:25,601
Pour one more.

141
00:13:30,943 --> 00:13:34,174
l welcome the News TV viewers.
Show The Spirit.

142
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:36,914
ln this programme l'm welcoming
our guest of today.

143
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:40,585
The minister of tourism department
Shri Murali Krishnan.

144
00:13:40,786 --> 00:13:43,448
Then the master of this show
Shri Raghunanthan.

145
00:13:57,069 --> 00:13:59,936
Murali Krishnan!
The devotee of Guruvayoor

146
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:04,266
Every month on the first of Malayalam
month you go to visit Guruvayoor temple.

147
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:06,369
You are present during Nirmalayam
and Vagacharthu.

148
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:08,809
Then you give offering in
Kathalikara Thrupunni.

149
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:13,883
ln our gods Shri Krishnan
is most romantic.

150
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:18,646
From your history l came to know
that you also have a romantic heart.

151
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:24,553
ln college politics you were the star.
Head of left wing student's movement.

152
00:14:24,763 --> 00:14:33,193
Years together you were elected as the
head of Arts club of Maharaja's college.

153
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:40,504
That time your party had got only that one seat.
The individual image was what made you win.

154
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:44,581
Part time mimicry and drama. You showed
your ability in many fields like that.

155
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:50,078
Like Kannan had Gopikas Murali Krishnan
also had many lady fans.

156
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:54,924
lf your wife is seeing this programme,
let her also enjoy thisjoke.

157
00:14:55,961 --> 00:14:59,692
Sure. The name of your programme
itself is Show The Spirit.

158
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,094
She can take everything
in sportive spirit.

159
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:05,429
That is the reason for my
success too in a way. - Good.

160
00:15:05,971 --> 00:15:09,270
You used a word called success.
Connected to that l'll ask you a question.

161
00:15:09,475 --> 00:15:14,777
The word success. First you
became MLA. Suddenly Minister.

162
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:17,107
That too for Tourism and Culture.

163
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:22,614
You started yourjourney aiming this position.
That is where you have reached now.

164
00:15:22,821 --> 00:15:25,881
Do you mean by success that?
- Not like that.

165
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:30,619
As a social service man as you said
l started with student's politics.

166
00:15:30,829 --> 00:15:34,458
Now at this moment l'm sitting before you.
l was telling about this journey.

167
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:40,799
l followed an honest route.
As a person l consider that as success.

168
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:48,804
Can you say that you got this position
for that honesty only?

169
00:15:49,014 --> 00:15:50,311
Else?
- Then...

170
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:53,545
My wishes to you Mr. Murali Krishnan.
- Thank you!

171
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:57,451
The alertness for everything.
There is no shyness in washing leg with tears.

172
00:15:57,756 --> 00:15:59,724
A back bone which is ready
to turn in any direction.

173
00:15:59,858 --> 00:16:03,259
The smartness to find the correct
person and stand in his shade.

174
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:08,161
How much ever problems raise a shrewd
mind to see that his group wins at any cost.

175
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:14,169
The smartness to talk rate.
Ready to buy anything at any cost.

176
00:16:14,373 --> 00:16:18,503
The power to kill any one and
hide that successfully.

177
00:16:18,777 --> 00:16:21,007
You must have had to fight with
so many people with these qualities.

178
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:24,111
After that if you could come to this
position you are a real success.

179
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:26,511
The man who is going in
search of higher level.

180
00:16:28,454 --> 00:16:30,786
Again l wish you Mr. Murali Krishnan.

181
00:16:31,623 --> 00:16:34,854
Your abilities don't end here.

182
00:16:36,362 --> 00:16:38,353
You are smiling sweetly.

183
00:16:38,564 --> 00:16:42,022
But your line of words is poisonous.
An aim to degrade me. l know that.

184
00:16:42,234 --> 00:16:46,102
Let us proceed to questions.
What do you say? - Sure.

185
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:52,871
Press and television channels daily bring
to us the news of male's indecency.

186
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:56,442
Woman has become
a sex product.

187
00:16:56,648 --> 00:17:01,551
ln public, in by lanes.
Why even at home she is not safe.

188
00:17:01,754 --> 00:17:04,154
Without difference of age she is
being hunted all over the country.

189
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:09,123
Cultured Kerala.
This word has become an abuse.

190
00:17:10,095 --> 00:17:17,661
At present Kerala is facing social problems.
ln that women molestation is the prime one.

191
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:20,862
First the reason for this is drinking.

192
00:17:21,273 --> 00:17:25,334
The drinking habit in men is
spoiling the family life.

193
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:30,508
Many relationships are ending in divorce.
That is a big social problem.

194
00:17:33,118 --> 00:17:36,144
l don't know whether Shri Raghunanthan
is married. Are you?

195
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:42,188
l was married.
Some 7 years back l divorced.

196
00:17:42,461 --> 00:17:45,430
From that time till now l drink.

197
00:17:45,697 --> 00:17:48,757
Was that bad habit responsible
for the divorce?

198
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:52,996
Sorry! l'm not the person to
question you. Even then.

199
00:17:53,872 --> 00:17:59,868
You can surely ask. An open hearted talk
of two people is what Show The Spirit is.

200
00:18:02,114 --> 00:18:06,151
My wife Meera was against
many things including drinking.

201
00:18:06,151 --> 00:18:08,949
That is what her name is.
She could not bear the life with me.

202
00:18:09,154 --> 00:18:16,117
Then we together found this solution divorce.
Today she is happily married to another man.

203
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:21,128
ln this city. No, in this world they
are the closest friends of mine.

204
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:23,460
Alexe and Meera! l hope you
are watching this show.

205
00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:29,630
Shall l come back to the
next question? - Sure.

206
00:18:29,842 --> 00:18:35,474
Too much sex and drinking habit
is increasing in our society.

207
00:18:35,848 --> 00:18:41,411
To save our mother,
sister or daughters from their eyes..

208
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:48,483
..why can't with govt. approval
prostitution can be made legal?

209
00:18:48,694 --> 00:18:49,558
That is point.

210
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:57,831
Mr. Raghunanthan! Thieves want that
no house should be locked at night.

211
00:18:58,036 --> 00:19:00,732
Thieves are also human.
They also have to live.

212
00:19:00,939 --> 00:19:03,567
Like saying that this is silly
and stupidity.

213
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:08,610
Look here my friend. Our nation
has a strong custom and culture.

214
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:14,446
ln lndia at some places with govt.
approval these things are going on.

215
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:16,780
There is historical reason for that.

216
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:21,688
For that we can't make it legal
and bring it to act.

217
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:24,021
Saying that is atrocity and
anti social.

218
00:19:24,229 --> 00:19:28,427
This is a topic for debate. Let at some
other time this topic is taken in talk show.

219
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:31,870
Left to you are you against
this illegal act? - Exactly.

220
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:36,029
Some of our sisters are fated
to do that profession.

221
00:19:36,241 --> 00:19:38,368
We must save them from that.
My govt. is working for that.

222
00:19:38,577 --> 00:19:40,044
They are living in hell.

223
00:19:40,245 --> 00:19:44,807
To see that hell have you ever
gone to any prostitution home?

224
00:19:45,784 --> 00:19:49,481
Never. - Should l believe
this Mr. Murali Krishnan?

225
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:52,213
Truth should be believed.
Without preconception.

226
00:19:52,424 --> 00:19:54,619
That is what a decent press reporting is.

227
00:19:55,427 --> 00:20:01,229
Thanks for that advice. Last March
you had visited Macao lsland.

228
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:05,228
As Tourism minister you'll have
to do lots of tours like that.

229
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:08,839
We have to see to make out many things.
After seeing only we can understand.

230
00:20:09,441 --> 00:20:12,239
Before you many who were in this
chair have done such tours.

231
00:20:16,014 --> 00:20:19,415
But in Macao Sanpedro there
is a 5 star prostitute home.

232
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:22,246
l won't ask you why you did
a tour to there.

233
00:20:22,454 --> 00:20:24,684
Because whether it is in govt.
money or own money no..

234
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,916
..one goes to Macao Sanpedro
to eat or sleep well.

235
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:30,759
They go there to have sex.
- Nonsense.

236
00:20:30,963 --> 00:20:32,590
This is sheer nonsense.

237
00:20:36,868 --> 00:20:48,678
{ MACHAAN }

238
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:53,218
These photographs?
- ThatO

239
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:57,354
Fake. By joining body and
head fake photos are made.

240
00:20:57,723 --> 00:21:00,283
That can be done by kids
studying in KG std.

241
00:21:02,894 --> 00:21:05,454
You can ask me what more
proof l have other than this.

242
00:21:05,664 --> 00:21:08,292
Ask me sir. l'm ready to answer.

243
00:21:09,735 --> 00:21:10,997
Answer him.

244
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:18,807
No. l can't stay in this show
even for a minute.

245
00:21:19,011 --> 00:21:23,141
You have planned and insulted me.
Behind this bad power are involved.

246
00:21:23,348 --> 00:21:25,816
This is a cheap programme where you try to
tarnish the image of socially respected people.

247
00:21:26,018 --> 00:21:29,647
This is a cheap programme.
l'm sorry. Let me go.

248
00:21:37,696 --> 00:21:39,721
The viewers of Show The Spirit
programme knows.

249
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:43,499
Many episodes of this programme
have ended in an angry note.

250
00:21:43,702 --> 00:21:47,331
Many times they abruptly end in half way.
We don't do a postmortem about that.

251
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:51,999
You've seen faces losing color with anger.
That is what we had to show you.

252
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,007
What ever it may be.
Any place even seven seas away..

253
00:21:57,215 --> 00:21:59,683
..where they think they are
safe our eyes are present.

254
00:21:59,885 --> 00:22:02,513
Those eyes will follow and
that will continue.

255
00:22:02,721 --> 00:22:04,848
With that this Raghunanthan is
signing off from Show The Spirit.

256
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:06,854
Good night!

257
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,219
Binoy! - Yes.
- Send some water for me.

258
00:22:34,586 --> 00:22:36,884
What a sleep is this?
Get up father.

259
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:38,386
Do you know what the time is?

260
00:22:42,227 --> 00:23:03,537
{ MACHAAN }

261
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:18,260
All the advantages of you and
your family's staying here is there.

262
00:23:18,797 --> 00:23:21,357
Actually this is not a resort.
lt is my home. - Very good.

263
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:25,032
Son? - Yes. - Hi young man!
What is your name?

264
00:23:27,205 --> 00:23:31,369
He can't talk and hear.
- l'm sorry. - lt is alright.

265
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:45,717
My name is Aditya. Pet name is Sunny.
- Good. Nice boy.

266
00:23:50,162 --> 00:23:53,791
Hai, Raghu! - How is Sunny?
- He is fine. He is here.

267
00:23:53,999 --> 00:24:00,234
What happened? - Nothing.
- Raghu! Raghu!

268
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:17,915
When you feel like you come.
How long should l wait for a cup of coffee?

269
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:20,591
Last time you told me not
to come before 9 o'clock.

270
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:22,419
Ok, go. Go. Get me black coffee.

271
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:35,899
He is well educated but doesn't know
how to light a gas stove.

272
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:42,443
lt is not that he doesn't know. He's scared.
He stands as if he is setting fire to dead body.

273
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:45,282
He thinks that he fill catch fire.

274
00:25:22,921 --> 00:25:26,448
What is the use of studying so much?

275
00:25:27,893 --> 00:25:32,330
What is the use of having so much money
if he can't drink a cup of coffee when needed?

276
00:26:09,501 --> 00:26:11,366
Shall l sweep and mop?
There is dust all over.

277
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:12,537
No need to do it today.
You can go.

278
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:15,365
Are there any cloths to wash?
- Nothing. You can go.

279
00:26:37,996 --> 00:26:40,432
When ever l tell him about
cleaning he says the same thing.

280
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:43,560
Not today. Not today.
What kind of a man?

281
00:26:43,969 --> 00:26:45,561
But he gives me salary on time.

282
00:26:57,882 --> 00:26:59,679
Mani is coming.

283
00:27:00,719 --> 00:27:05,156
Mania! - God!
- Come here.

284
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:08,657
ls it you Maistry?
l didn't see you. Are you fine?

285
00:27:09,427 --> 00:27:15,332
What is there to say? Due to my improving
health l can neither stand nor sit.

286
00:27:15,533 --> 00:27:18,331
Didn't you show anyone?
- l showed.

287
00:27:18,536 --> 00:27:22,836
l showed the textile
showroom to 2-3 people.

288
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:27,671
l have work. l'll go.
- Give me money for a quarter.

289
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:32,180
l don't have even Rs.5 with me.
- Will you get loan here?

290
00:27:32,717 --> 00:27:35,185
l didn't come to get liquor.
l came to meet a guy.

291
00:27:35,387 --> 00:27:36,854
He is not there. Shall l go?

292
00:27:38,056 --> 00:27:42,959
You have started lying to your Guru
who thought you work. lsn't it Mania?

293
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:47,189
You'll not improve.
Did you hear?

294
00:27:48,767 --> 00:27:58,369
The sin done in Kumbakonam is
getting destroyed in Kumbakonam.

295
00:27:59,144 --> 00:28:01,704
From where am l going to
get money for a quarter?

296
00:28:12,424 --> 00:28:23,733
Pangajam! Pangajam!
Come here. Pangajam!

297
00:28:23,935 --> 00:28:25,562
What is it?
- Come here.

298
00:28:26,438 --> 00:28:30,397
lf you roam around in some
other guys house, who'll feed me?

299
00:28:30,608 --> 00:28:31,905
Talk decently.
l have kept everything there.

300
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:34,578
Many times l have told you to keep
the food ready and then go.

301
00:28:34,779 --> 00:28:41,412
l have kept it. - l'll kill you.
- Listen to me. - Don't talk.

302
00:28:46,191 --> 00:28:48,819
You come home.
l'll give the rest there.- Mania!

303
00:28:50,128 --> 00:28:54,588
To you only. Come here.

304
00:29:01,473 --> 00:29:06,433
Come this side. You cheap.
Are you not ashamed?

305
00:29:06,878 --> 00:29:10,507
Will any man hit his wife like
this in road?

306
00:29:12,183 --> 00:29:15,880
When we tie & hit a house bred
dog we think it'll not bite us back.

307
00:29:16,154 --> 00:29:17,712
This courage is due to that.

308
00:29:21,493 --> 00:29:25,623
Are you drunk? Are you?

309
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:31,133
ln future if you enter this colony
after consuming liquor..

310
00:29:31,336 --> 00:29:34,066
..you and your Mayilvahanan
will lie in that gutter.

311
00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:38,066
ldiot! Do you understand?
Useless guy. - Yes.

312
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:40,478
Household problem must be
solved inside the house.

313
00:29:40,678 --> 00:29:43,272
Not in the road.
Get out from here.

314
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:50,549
What is it? - From morning
he is drinking.- ls it?

315
00:29:53,324 --> 00:29:56,054
To spoil the peace of people.
- Yes, yes.

316
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:03,058
Malathi! From some days
you have been doing yoga.

317
00:30:03,368 --> 00:30:05,165
Then why do you need this
advance course now?.

318
00:30:05,837 --> 00:30:09,773
Krishna! This is notjust yoga.
ln Hamsa yogaO

319
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:13,068
Hamsa yoga. Our elder daughter
is quite old.

320
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:18,079
Her elder daughter's engagement is over.
ls there any need for this yoga Malathi?

321
00:30:18,283 --> 00:30:23,084
What ever is there it is fate.
- lt is four days only.

322
00:30:23,288 --> 00:30:27,019
l have kept everything in fridge.
Tell that Pangajam to heat it.

323
00:30:27,225 --> 00:30:31,685
l don't want any one's help for that.
ls it enough if food is there at home?

324
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:36,198
After reaching l'll call.
- Don't get late.

325
00:30:36,401 --> 00:30:40,030
Bangalore flight is on time. Our daughter
will come to airport to pick you up.

326
00:30:40,405 --> 00:30:41,201
Okay.

327
00:30:42,307 --> 00:30:44,036
l'm going to airport.
l'll call later on.

328
00:30:50,715 --> 00:31:03,150
{ MACHAAN }

329
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:18,200
Captain!
- Wife has gone out of station.

330
00:31:18,443 --> 00:31:21,970
So let us celebrate big boy.

331
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:26,410
Get me liberated my boy.

332
00:31:26,784 --> 00:31:30,311
You must drink in day time.
Which one? - Your wish.

333
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:33,820
There is a case.
- No problem.

334
00:31:35,126 --> 00:31:37,185
lf it is in district court,
you can go bravely.

335
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:41,889
l know 3 lawyers. After drinking
from bar they go to bar.

336
00:31:42,133 --> 00:31:44,863
lf you ask me the name, l won't tell.
How much ever you ask l won't tell.

337
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:51,531
Brother! This is not that case. Piece.
- You first said case. Now you are saying piece.

338
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:55,937
Decide one in both these.
- l don't know subtitling.

339
00:31:56,147 --> 00:32:00,550
One girl. When Malathi is
not there at home she comes.

340
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:06,050
Tell clearly like that.
Do you have protection in hand?

341
00:32:06,724 --> 00:32:09,454
To talk like this why do
l need protection?

342
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:12,119
Where are you from?
- l'm from Pattanamthitta.

343
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:16,289
Leave that. For the sake
of safety buy one or two.

344
00:32:16,668 --> 00:32:20,297
We are poor men who succumb
to circumstances.

345
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:25,869
l'm going straight to Koshi's. From
Johnson's hand l must have 3 pegs. No need.

346
00:32:26,144 --> 00:32:28,305
Yeah!
- Come.

347
00:32:32,517 --> 00:32:37,648
We can't leave it to Raghunanthan.
He is mad. When he told you tell me.

348
00:32:38,189 --> 00:32:42,751
We came to meet Ashraf.
The CAO of this. Ashraf Marancheri!

349
00:32:43,027 --> 00:32:45,222
l'll give it to Ganghadaran.

350
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:50,392
l have hinted the matter to Ashraf.
He didn't say anything.

351
00:32:50,768 --> 00:32:53,328
He said he'll be back.
He made us sit and went away.

352
00:32:53,538 --> 00:32:54,835
As soon as we leave we'll call you.

353
00:32:56,541 --> 00:32:57,667
He is coming.

354
00:32:58,876 --> 00:33:01,504
Sorry! After afternoon there
is an investigation meet.

355
00:33:01,779 --> 00:33:03,679
l have to hear to those who invested.

356
00:33:04,215 --> 00:33:06,649
Before meeting l have to
get ready some papers.

357
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:11,682
Hasn't channel reached a stage
where profit and loss is no issue?

358
00:33:11,889 --> 00:33:15,655
lt'll take time to break even.
- All the problems can be solved.

359
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:18,761
lf you accept our proposal.
- l know Srikumar.

360
00:33:19,097 --> 00:33:23,466
Raghunanthan is not the staff of this channel.
He doesn't take even single rupee for this.

361
00:33:23,735 --> 00:33:26,863
He had only one demand before
he started Show The Spirit.

362
00:33:27,071 --> 00:33:32,873
That is freedom. l don't have to tell you.
On that one show this channel is withstanding.

363
00:33:33,077 --> 00:33:38,310
You just talk Ashraf. Get the photos
of Murali Krishnan's Macau tour.

364
00:33:40,051 --> 00:33:45,318
How can we throw him away from the cabinet?
You ask Raghunanthan that too.

365
00:33:45,757 --> 00:33:49,056
He has not succumbed
to bigger issues then this.

366
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:52,561
Among you who is standing
ready with the minister dress?

367
00:33:52,764 --> 00:33:57,667
You will come to know that Ashraf.
- You'll get two crores.

368
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:04,565
You have to email 4 photos.
That's all.

369
00:34:04,776 --> 00:34:08,075
What are you saying?
Photos are not channel's property.

370
00:34:09,781 --> 00:34:14,582
l'll talk to Raghu and see.
- Okay. We'll be in the rest house.

371
00:34:14,786 --> 00:34:16,413
You phone us Ashraf.
- Okay.

372
00:34:16,621 --> 00:34:21,024
lf it works out, payment will be
made today itself. Okay.

373
00:34:23,127 --> 00:34:31,364
{ MACHAAN }

374
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:37,196
Some big shots from Minister Murali Krishnan's
opposition party had come here.

375
00:34:38,342 --> 00:34:42,039
News TV is a sinking ship.
They have offered 2 crores.

376
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:44,111
They might need the photographs.

377
00:34:44,315 --> 00:34:47,045
The sex act which Murali Krishnan
did in San Pedro.

378
00:34:48,052 --> 00:34:52,148
Yes. - lt must be a big relief for you
if you get 2 crores. lsn't it Ashraf?

379
00:34:52,457 --> 00:34:53,788
l don't have to tell you.

380
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:59,791
No need.
That will be like political pimping.

381
00:34:59,997 --> 00:35:03,125
Then what is the difference
between them and us?

382
00:35:03,334 --> 00:35:05,632
l told them this will be the answer.

383
00:35:06,504 --> 00:35:08,369
Whether Murali Krishnan has
to be kept in party or he..

384
00:35:08,573 --> 00:35:14,205
..should be removed is there problem.
- Hang up.

385
00:35:20,017 --> 00:35:21,314
l'll call you later.

386
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,582
What happened Captain Murali Krishnan?

387
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:27,747
Has our bird started?
- lt is ready to take flight.

388
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:33,590
She'll have only white wine.
- John! One bottle white wine parcel.

389
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:37,734
lt is ready. - The other one.
- Okay. - What is that?

390
00:35:39,036 --> 00:35:42,631
Between two skin
the reaction of third skin.

391
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:49,110
lt may be needed. Bless me and send.
- Okay. Have this.

392
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:52,009
One on the way.
- No need. l might sleep.

393
00:35:56,354 --> 00:35:57,252
Thank you!

394
00:35:58,389 --> 00:36:00,949
Tell him best wishes.
- What is the matter?

395
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:04,356
Captain sir is going to find a new territory.

396
00:36:08,533 --> 00:36:09,431
All the best.

397
00:36:14,238 --> 00:36:17,105
Raghu! Did you promise a gift to Sunny?

398
00:36:17,308 --> 00:36:20,573
He is nagging me.
- Yes, yes.

399
00:36:21,712 --> 00:36:24,010
What was that? l forgot.

400
00:36:24,482 --> 00:36:28,475
Tell me. - l know what it is.
But won't say.

401
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:30,517
This is the after picks of your drinking.

402
00:36:30,721 --> 00:36:33,986
The reason for your memory loss.
- Meera! Come on.

403
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:39,596
Tell me. lt was some silly toy.
- lt is not silly to him.

404
00:36:39,797 --> 00:36:43,130
lt'll be very costly. When you
remember you get that and come.

405
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:51,608
Hello, Raghu!
- Dear! You ask Sunny.

406
00:36:51,809 --> 00:36:56,473
He had told me to get some thing.
Meera is not telling me.

407
00:36:56,681 --> 00:37:02,620
l can't ask him too.
- Don't worry. l'll manage that.

408
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:06,085
How?. He also has his mother's nature.

409
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:08,815
He is not telling me.
- Leave it.

410
00:37:09,026 --> 00:37:12,928
lf you ask him whether you asked me
to buy jack fruit he'll say no it is mango.

411
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:19,499
Clever man. Thanks. Thanks a lot.

412
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:21,003
Hai, Alexe!

413
00:37:31,616 --> 00:37:39,580
Did you ask dad for a toy....a train?

414
00:37:40,625 --> 00:37:42,593
No.

415
00:37:44,395 --> 00:37:46,363
Oh....coolers?

416
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:48,459

419
00:37:55,806 --> 00:37:57,899
You are telling lies.

420

No...l asked for a kite

421
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:04,243

Are all you Christians shifting

432
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:05,908
Only that is what is needed.
- He is not a Christian.

433
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:09,136
He is Changanachery Nair.
- Say properly.

00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:13,943
By Achayan l didn't mean Christians.

Meera's rule.
- Okay. You come when you finish.

439
00:39:31,769 --> 00:39:35,261
Didn't he marry again?
- No. A life alone.

440
00:39:35,473 --> 00:39:39,000
He doesn't have any relatives too.
Parents died early.

00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:42,202
He had a brother.
He also died last year.

442
00:39:44,648 --> 00:39:47,310
But he is quite a genius. lsn't he?

00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,967
Samir! Now we can hang and die.

448
00:40:12,176 --> 00:40:15,407
From this cynic we are hearing good words.

Come here.

458
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:54,977

ln the path of life let us leave
our foot prints.

483
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:52,252
ln the bottom of scented water
let us unite hands and stand.

484
00:44:52,489 --> 00:44:58,359
l'm in a get together in
Alexe's house. Okay. - Stop it.

485
00:45:01,065 --> 00:45:04,660
l'll call you back. Okay? Okay.
- Why call him afterwards?

486
00:45:04,902 --> 00:45:08,235
You talk to him now.
- l just. l mean it was an international call.

487
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:11,364
So what? So what? l told everyone.

488
00:45:11,575 --> 00:45:13,440
Those not interested can go out.

489
00:45:13,644 --> 00:45:16,636
lt was intended for bores like you.
- l'm sorry.

490
00:45:16,847 --> 00:45:20,681
Attitude. That is what it is.
A place where some one is singing.

491
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:22,613
A place where some one
is giving speech.

492
00:45:22,753 --> 00:45:25,244
Even in front of dead body they
can't remain without talking in phone.

493
00:45:25,355 --> 00:45:26,549
You can't concentrate in any thing.

494
00:45:26,757 --> 00:45:28,520
What would happen to
this international call?

495
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:31,388
Raghu! Leave it. Cool.

496
00:45:31,595 --> 00:45:34,894
People like him should not
come to this place.

497
00:45:35,099 --> 00:45:38,557
Each and every minute they
are on to some deal.

498
00:45:38,769 --> 00:45:42,102
They should remain in some
money box day and night.

499
00:45:42,306 --> 00:45:43,432
Raghu, please!
- You don't talk.

500
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:47,303
What is there to talk constantly in phone?
Get out.

501
00:45:47,511 --> 00:45:49,411
You come.
- Raghuetta, please!

502
00:45:49,613 --> 00:45:53,947
lf l stay here it'll end in a fight.
l'm going. Enough.

503
00:46:11,502 --> 00:46:18,965
Take it. One more. Let me see.
- Superb.

504
00:46:24,515 --> 00:46:25,311
Good. lsn't it?

505
00:46:44,067 --> 00:46:48,060
Here is a pray. l'll go. Keep the
camera ready. - l'll shoot.

506
00:46:50,874 --> 00:46:52,466

507
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:55,001
ldiot!
- Sorry!

508
00:46:58,682 --> 00:46:59,910
Got it correctly.

509
00:47:02,986 --> 00:47:05,477
Excuse me! Landmark is in which floor?

510
00:47:05,689 --> 00:47:07,316
Third floor.
- Thanks!

511
00:47:11,395 --> 00:47:12,225
Come.

512
00:47:41,758 --> 00:47:42,782
You go.

513
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:51,800
Aye! Stop there.

514
00:47:56,607 --> 00:47:57,369
Move.

515
00:48:02,212 --> 00:48:02,974
Stop.

516
00:48:25,636 --> 00:48:26,500
Don't hit me.

517
00:48:33,677 --> 00:48:35,770
Don't hit me. Don't hit me.

518
00:48:37,648 --> 00:48:39,343
Get up.
- Sorry!

519
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:48,987
Sorry! Sorry! - Come on.

520

Put him in jeep.

Please!

522
00:49:30,701 --> 00:49:32,396
Mam! Shall we do touch up?

00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:52,920
You can call me after one hour. Okay.

527
00:50:26,590 --> 00:50:27,614
l have heard that she is problematic.

528
00:50:27,824 --> 00:50:29,416
She abuses and then hits.
- Who?

00:50:45,642 --> 00:50:48,304
This show is starting here
today with a new guest.

534
00:50:48,512 --> 00:50:50,571
This guest has lot of specialties.

535
00:50:50,781 --> 00:50:53,511
She is beautiful, young and dynamic.

536
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:57,585
The new face in police force.
Shrimati Supriya Raghavan lPS.

537
00:50:58,488 --> 00:51:00,422

539
00:51:04,461 --> 00:51:07,487
The master of the show.
Welcome, sir!

540
00:51:13,537 --> 00:51:15,061

546
00:51:33,223 --> 00:51:39,025
Okay. Your father was in
police department. lsn't it?

547
00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:42,762
When you say in department.
Yes. He was a constable.

548
00:51:42,966 --> 00:51:46,868
He must be proud to see this
achievement of his daughter's.

549
00:51:47,070 --> 00:51:51,803
Congratulations sir! Your father
must be seeing this programme. lsn't it?

550
00:51:52,008 --> 00:51:56,809
You are from Trichur. When you
talk that Trichur dialect is not there.

551
00:51:57,013 --> 00:51:59,846
Why? - l studied in other areas.
lt must be due to that.

552
00:52:00,050 --> 00:52:03,019
That l noticed. Degree is
from Palghat Mercy college.

553
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:04,482
PG from Kozhikkodu Presidency college.

554
00:52:04,688 --> 00:52:06,713
Didn't they give admission
in Trichur women's college?

555
00:52:06,923 --> 00:52:09,221
lt is not that they didn't give.
l didn't apply.

556
00:52:09,426 --> 00:52:12,122
One or two of my close friends
tried in Mercy college.

557
00:52:12,329 --> 00:52:14,661
l also applied there. - You didn't want
to get separated from your friends.

558
00:52:14,865 --> 00:52:19,325
Friends mean Nafez Razia.
She is in Alvashi Bank Dubai.

559
00:52:19,536 --> 00:52:23,597
Another one is Sarai Matti. She is living
with her husband near lndore collectorate.

560
00:52:24,274 --> 00:52:26,105
She is a home maker.

561
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:29,335
Do you miss those olden days?
The language that you enjoy so much.

562
00:52:30,113 --> 00:52:34,311
You come soon. lf you some slowly
like this, you'll miss the bus.

563
00:52:34,518 --> 00:52:36,679
ls that that morning star?
Let that go.

564
00:52:36,887 --> 00:52:39,549
The neighbor jack fruit is a type.

565
00:52:39,756 --> 00:52:45,558
He keeps staring like a fly.
Do you think about those best days?

566
00:52:46,163 --> 00:52:49,428
So you are an actor too?
You are a good actor.

567
00:52:50,133 --> 00:52:53,000
Some do say like that. - How did you
know about my friends details?

568
00:52:53,203 --> 00:52:54,693
Did you investigate so much about me?

569
00:52:54,905 --> 00:52:57,430
That is the specialty of Show The Spirit.

570
00:52:57,641 --> 00:52:58,699
Coffee Mam.
- Thanks!

571
00:52:58,909 --> 00:53:00,706
To know about the guest who come here.

572
00:53:00,911 --> 00:53:04,278
We accumulate all the details
we get about them.

573
00:53:09,152 --> 00:53:12,178
The secrets that we don't know about the
guest we are opening in front of our viewers.

574
00:53:12,389 --> 00:53:13,617
That is the aim of this show.

575
00:53:18,728 --> 00:53:22,824
Some days back in a shopping mall
a boy misbehaved with you.

576
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:28,665
Misbehaving means without permission
he touched your body.

577
00:53:29,272 --> 00:53:30,534
The boy tried to run away.
l have to call him as a boy.

578
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:34,232
He isjust 15 years old.
You chased him.

579
00:53:34,444 --> 00:53:39,177
You used all your police
training and nabbed him.

580
00:53:39,382 --> 00:53:41,043
The visuals of you catching him.

581
00:53:41,251 --> 00:53:44,687
The guy in that mall took
video of that in his mobile.

582
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:48,324
Then through the press
this whole world saw that.

583
00:53:49,392 --> 00:53:51,690
Are you feeling proud Supriya madam?

584
00:53:53,797 --> 00:53:57,324
Even if you feel like that,
l'll say it is a shame.

585
00:53:58,835 --> 00:54:00,325
What do you mean?

586
00:54:00,537 --> 00:54:05,497
He removed his uniform and from the
bag he took out his casuals and wore that.

587
00:54:05,709 --> 00:54:09,372
He is one of the many in city
who roam in malls like this.

588
00:54:09,579 --> 00:54:12,639
l heard your statement that
he is a drug addict.

589
00:54:12,849 --> 00:54:14,646
What kind of drug does he use?

590
00:54:14,851 --> 00:54:17,251
From public health lab that
report has not come still now.

591
00:54:17,454 --> 00:54:22,323
SV tablets. lt is the code name
of a psychiatric drug.

592
00:54:22,525 --> 00:54:25,517
l can't tell the correct name
outside so l'm not saying that.

593
00:54:25,729 --> 00:54:27,356
Psychiatric patients who are
dangerous use that.

594
00:54:27,564 --> 00:54:30,931
lt is a relaxation inducer
that physicians prescribe them.

595
00:54:31,134 --> 00:54:36,504
Many popular children in schools
of Kerala use this poison.

596
00:54:36,706 --> 00:54:39,266
Which public lab report do
you need to know about that?

597
00:54:39,476 --> 00:54:43,503
We have our own strategy
in this matter. - Okay.

598
00:54:43,713 --> 00:54:47,911
What is that strategy?
- To cut the supply of drug.

599
00:54:48,118 --> 00:54:51,349
We appoint sniff groups to
identify those drug groups.

600
00:54:51,554 --> 00:54:56,389
lt is a 5 step plan.
l can't reveal all details.

601
00:54:59,829 --> 00:55:04,289
Totally useless. - lt is proven.
- The incident that took place yesterday.

602
00:55:04,501 --> 00:55:06,867
lt is a small reflection of this problem.

603
00:55:07,070 --> 00:55:10,369
That is the indication of the failure
of your miserable strategy.

604
00:55:10,573 --> 00:55:12,336
Madam! l don't have to tell you.

605
00:55:12,542 --> 00:55:16,478
Could you make a good preventive system?

606
00:55:17,614 --> 00:55:21,675
Cool, cool, liquor, Gin Giny.
Our children are getting used to this.

607
00:55:21,885 --> 00:55:23,910
When this tobacco is not enough for them.

608
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:27,612
The chemicals that mix in their blood.
lt could be tablet.

609
00:55:27,824 --> 00:55:29,655
lt could be stamp or syringe.

610
00:55:29,859 --> 00:55:34,489
To supply that your supplier
group chain is still there intact.

611
00:55:34,698 --> 00:55:39,328
When your operation is targeting
them you forget one basic thing.

612
00:55:39,536 --> 00:55:41,595
Where ever there is a demand
there will be supply.

613
00:55:41,805 --> 00:55:44,774
There will be people who will be
ready to supply to the needy.

614
00:55:47,177 --> 00:55:50,112
lf you cut the chain in Eranakulam,
it'll reach Aluva.

615
00:55:50,313 --> 00:55:55,410
This child will buy it for Rs.100.
lnstead you cut the demand.

616
00:55:55,618 --> 00:56:01,147
To those young brains you must take this.
The so called reach of your strategy.

617
00:56:05,695 --> 00:56:06,559
Mr. Raghunanthan!

618
00:56:06,763 --> 00:56:11,598
What do children eat or use to see that
is the duty of parents and teacher.

619
00:56:11,801 --> 00:56:13,769
This whole thing is not police job.

620
00:56:13,970 --> 00:56:17,838
That is what my question is.
Then what is the job of the police?

621
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:22,137
To reach a police where crime is taking place.
That you hit the criminal left and right.

622
00:56:22,345 --> 00:56:25,143
lt is your duty to see that a
crime doesn't take place.

623
00:56:25,849 --> 00:56:29,580
To stop an incident from taking place.
Are you doing that?

624
00:56:32,422 --> 00:56:34,413
No. You are not doing that.
lt is not possible for you to do.

625
00:56:34,624 --> 00:56:39,152
With alertness standing inside
a civic society with humanity..

626
00:56:39,362 --> 00:56:42,798
..with planning. From inside and outside
to protect us is your responsibility.

627
00:56:42,999 --> 00:56:46,332
You have to take up that. For that
you must know the surrounding.

628
00:56:46,536 --> 00:56:48,697
You should be able to know
the pulse of this society.

629
00:56:48,905 --> 00:56:50,463
Local language should not
leave from our tongue.

630
00:56:50,673 --> 00:56:53,005
Above all you must stand for humanity.

631
00:56:56,679 --> 00:56:58,874
l'm not criticizing one full force
and its wings.

632
00:56:59,082 --> 00:57:03,678
Let this conversation be an
inspiration for the officials to change.

633
00:57:07,056 --> 00:57:08,546
Thank you so much Supriya Raghavan.

634
00:57:08,758 --> 00:57:10,089
Good night!
- Good night!

635
00:57:19,936 --> 00:57:21,028
Put the brake carefully.

636
00:57:21,371 --> 00:57:23,100
Look there you monkey.
lt is the police.

637
00:57:25,074 --> 00:57:29,477
We are hit. You be here.
l'll see and come.

638
00:57:29,679 --> 00:57:30,907
Anyway we are caught.

639
00:57:35,218 --> 00:57:37,311
Sir! lt is the Raghunanthan sir
from News TV.

640
00:57:37,687 --> 00:57:38,745
Whoever it may be.
ls it correct to drive after drinking?

641
00:57:38,955 --> 00:57:41,651
You blow and go.
- Sir! - Blow and then leave.

642
00:57:42,192 --> 00:57:46,526
This procedure itself is blow. l'm drunk.

643
00:57:46,729 --> 00:57:49,163
After drinking only l drove all this while.

644
00:57:49,365 --> 00:57:50,764
Tell me what is the next action?

645
00:57:50,967 --> 00:57:52,901
We have to go to govt. hospital.
Check the blood.

646
00:57:53,102 --> 00:57:56,128
Let us do that. While checking
the blood see the cholesterol too.

647
00:57:56,339 --> 00:57:59,069
We can make out that too.
- l'll inform Alexe sir.

648
00:57:59,275 --> 00:58:00,936
l must inform that you have been arrested.
- No need.

649
00:58:01,144 --> 00:58:04,602
You go. Can he go?
- He can go. You come with us.

650
00:58:04,814 --> 00:58:07,908
Can l drink and walk?
- Yes. - You go. Go.

651
00:58:08,852 --> 00:58:10,649
My car. We'll bring that.

652
00:58:16,726 --> 00:58:19,695
You stamped me.
- Sorry!

653
00:58:20,463 --> 00:58:24,695
Yes. We are outside the police station.
Yes. - Get down.

654
00:58:27,237 --> 00:58:28,534
What is the use of getting
the car released?

655
00:58:28,738 --> 00:58:32,469
Shouldn't sir get released?
Anotherjeep has come with drunkards.

656
00:58:32,675 --> 00:58:37,908
The decent guys. Okay.
lsn't it Raghunanthan sir?

657
00:58:38,448 --> 00:58:40,848
Some call like that.
My name is Raghunanthan.

658
00:58:41,050 --> 00:58:44,281
l'm a regular viewer of Show The Spirit.
l'm your fan.

659
00:58:44,487 --> 00:58:46,478
That is not a crime.
Why are you standing here?

660
00:58:46,689 --> 00:58:49,783
We are the people of
Kamaladalam Kaliyogam.

661
00:58:49,993 --> 00:58:52,223
l'm the secretary.
Our head is inside.

662
00:58:52,428 --> 00:58:56,797
ls Kadakali too a crime? - Our head has the
habit of drinking after the programme.

663
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,332
After that he is particular
about driving vehicle.

664
00:58:59,536 --> 00:59:02,471
Now today what happened?
He did driving. Police arrested him.

665
00:59:03,273 --> 00:59:05,002
You can sit inside.
- We can go.

666
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:07,608
KamaladalamO
Kamaladalam's people.

667
00:59:07,810 --> 00:59:11,974
Namaste! - We'll meet.
- He is good.

668
00:59:12,181 --> 00:59:13,808
You can sit there.
- l'll sit here.

669
00:59:15,952 --> 00:59:18,216
Sir! Will you give that mobile?

670
00:59:23,026 --> 00:59:26,985
Are you bored that l sat here.
- l'm totally ashamed.

671
00:59:27,196 --> 00:59:29,960
What is there to see now?. You sit.

672
00:59:34,604 --> 00:59:38,301
Was it dry?
- Was it dry?

673
00:59:38,508 --> 00:59:40,703
lf it was dry, police won't have arrested me.

674
00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:46,109
l was drunk. - The dress.
- That was dry.

675
00:59:46,316 --> 00:59:48,784
The dress was green.
- That is it?

676
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:52,581
Raghu sir! You are called in.

677
00:59:53,957 --> 00:59:57,290
Go and come.
There is nothing to worry.

678
00:59:57,493 --> 00:59:59,688
Let him go and come.
- Keep quiet.

679
01:00:01,798 --> 01:00:05,393
Before accident takes place
it should be stopped.

680
01:00:05,602 --> 01:00:10,471
An effective prevention system should
be made. Police must try for that.

681
01:00:11,941 --> 01:00:13,135
Advice.

682
01:00:13,776 --> 01:00:17,803
That too from a media celeb.
lt must be heard.

683
01:00:18,348 --> 01:00:19,474
lt must be accepted.

684
01:00:21,517 --> 01:00:26,978
l saw accident before hand in my heart.
Stop the guy who drinks and drives.

685
01:00:27,190 --> 01:00:33,823
Due to his mistake a life should not go.
He must not be allowed to spoil his own life.

686
01:00:34,030 --> 01:00:36,590
That is what brought you inside this.

687
01:00:38,067 --> 01:00:41,503
lsn't this the way police work
Mr. Raghunanthan?

688
01:00:44,540 --> 01:00:50,604
Now you can go. Alexe had called.
He and Meera are my best friends.

689
01:00:50,813 --> 01:00:53,680
We have not met in Casarosa
that is the reason.

690
01:00:54,384 --> 01:00:55,351
You can go.

691
01:00:56,886 --> 01:01:02,586
Thank you! l'm not going. After
my intoxication goes l'll leave tomorrow.

692
01:01:02,892 --> 01:01:08,023
l was searching for a police station
here l could spend a night.

693
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:15,599
This Raghunanthan has never
wanted to get away from..

694
01:01:15,838 --> 01:01:17,829
.. any crime till this date
due to recommendation.

695
01:01:18,074 --> 01:01:23,034
Good night Supriya Raghavan.

696
01:01:42,598 --> 01:01:43,724
Hai, Suresh!

697
01:01:46,602 --> 01:01:51,665
l don't know. l'll give. lt is Dr. Suresh.
He is not able to get Alexe's number.

698
01:01:51,874 --> 01:01:52,738
Give it to me.

699
01:01:54,043 --> 01:02:00,573
Good morning! Sure.
l'll come. Okay.

700
01:02:02,318 --> 01:02:05,583
lt is some days since you are having
some connection with Dr. Suresh.

701
01:02:05,788 --> 01:02:09,246
Off and on you go and meet him
in hospital. Phone calls come.

702
01:02:09,459 --> 01:02:12,019
Nothing. There is nothing.
- No.

703
01:02:13,029 --> 01:02:15,793
There is nothing.
- There is something.

704
01:02:16,866 --> 01:02:20,597
l can't lie to you.
There is a small matter.

705
01:02:21,404 --> 01:02:26,103
This time after the routine check up
was over he told me to do biopsy.

706
01:02:26,676 --> 01:02:28,507
Without your knowledge we did that.

707
01:02:28,911 --> 01:02:32,711
Today is the date l'll be getting its report.
That is why Dr. Suresh called me.

708
01:02:33,249 --> 01:02:37,049
Biopsy? ls this a small matter Alexe?
- ls it not?.

709
01:02:37,653 --> 01:02:40,713
Only if the report comes positive
we need to worry.

710
01:02:42,558 --> 01:02:46,619
Meera! Don't think that
biopsy report means cancer.

711
01:02:47,063 --> 01:02:51,693
God is not sitting quiet.
This report will come first in his table.

712
01:02:52,201 --> 01:02:55,136
On seeing problem he'll first correct
it and then only send.

713
01:02:55,838 --> 01:03:00,298
With worry l'll die.
- Be quiet. Get up and get ready fast.

714
01:03:00,676 --> 01:03:02,701
We'll go together and get the report.

715
01:03:03,112 --> 01:03:07,139
lf the report is negative,
l have decided what gift l'll be giving you.

716
01:03:08,151 --> 01:03:12,986
What will you give me?
Think about only that.

717
01:03:19,095 --> 01:03:38,175
{ MACHAAN }

718
01:03:46,789 --> 01:03:50,190
Come.
- l won't. l won't come there.

719
01:03:51,227 --> 01:03:52,023
Okay.

720
01:04:03,439 --> 01:04:05,805
Suresh! Turn the car.
- Okay.

721
01:04:09,712 --> 01:04:12,875
Johnson! Where is the photo
of Dinesh Kodiyeri here?

722
01:04:13,082 --> 01:04:17,712
You must keep it. - Okay.
- Guru! l'm here.

723
01:04:18,287 --> 01:04:20,380
This painter was not there
in this hell before.

724
01:04:20,590 --> 01:04:23,491
Tomorrow in Darbar hall
there is his exhibition.

725
01:04:24,393 --> 01:04:28,124
John, sir! Repeat.
- lf you get time you must come.

726
01:04:28,464 --> 01:04:32,992
lt'll be good.
- Due to that painting won't get sold Swami.

727
01:04:33,202 --> 01:04:35,397
For that you must get hold of the
pimp and give them commission.

728
01:04:35,805 --> 01:04:39,571
Johnson! One more for each of us.
We'll go after drinking that.

729
01:04:39,942 --> 01:04:43,901
ln this ethnic bar one peg is Rs.200.
Why did you come here?

730
01:04:44,113 --> 01:04:46,206
Who is going to pay for this?
lt is in your account.

731
01:04:46,415 --> 01:04:50,078
Very good. You must beg and drink.
Then only you'll get maximum satisfaction.

732
01:04:55,191 --> 01:04:57,318
Swami's liver is gone.

733
01:04:59,362 --> 01:05:01,990
That day he vomited blood.
He was then hospitalized.

734
01:05:02,265 --> 01:05:04,733
Doctor said he must stop
for at least 6 months.

735
01:05:05,301 --> 01:05:06,768
You tell him.

736
01:05:08,237 --> 01:05:14,039
Me? First the preacher should be good.
Then only he should try to set right others.

737
01:05:14,243 --> 01:05:15,608
Let him drink as much as he wants.
When he feels like he'll stop.

738
01:05:15,811 --> 01:05:17,779
lf this goes on, he won't be alive.

739
01:05:18,848 --> 01:05:24,411
The famous liquor prohibitory Liver
cirrhosis came to our country and preached.

740
01:05:27,590 --> 01:05:30,787
Raghunanthan! - Raghu! lt is me.
- Tell me.

741
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:33,822
Where are you?
- ln bar. Tell me.

742
01:05:34,030 --> 01:05:38,296
l'm calling from hospital. AlexeO
- What happened to him?

743
01:05:38,834 --> 01:05:43,635
Did liver cirrhosis take place? Today all
are talking about drinking and dying.

744
01:05:43,906 --> 01:05:47,467
He doesn't drink much.
- l didn't say like that.

745
01:05:47,677 --> 01:05:49,144
Then you tell what you have to.

746
01:05:49,345 --> 01:05:52,143
Does he have any plan of divorcing you?
Tell me.

747
01:06:13,903 --> 01:06:15,598
Let us go.
- What happened?

748
01:06:18,641 --> 01:06:19,835
Alexe!

749
01:06:21,043 --> 01:06:22,670
Come on Alexe. Tell me.

750
01:06:23,913 --> 01:06:28,111
Meera! lt is nothing.

751
01:06:34,557 --> 01:06:39,517
Come around 7.30. Dress code.
You wear anything and come. Bye!

752
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:43,526
Sorry! lt was Lakshmi.
What happened to your wife?

753
01:06:43,966 --> 01:06:47,868
Okay. Are you sure to come?
Come before 8 o'clock. Bye!

754
01:06:49,472 --> 01:06:53,875
Pork Vindalo, grilled chicken.
Which ever you like you make.

755
01:06:54,076 --> 01:06:54,872
Okay.

756
01:06:55,411 --> 01:07:00,212
What is this? On the name of biopsy
report you are doing all this commotion.

757
01:07:01,650 --> 01:07:05,211
Birthday, anniversary above all that
this day should be celebrated.

758
01:07:05,421 --> 01:07:08,720
You have got life back. So it should
be celebrated with good friends.

759
01:07:09,258 --> 01:07:12,659
Even if there is problem,
now days it is easily curable.

760
01:07:12,862 --> 01:07:16,821
Keep quiet. Curable. Should
we call Raghunanthan sir?

761
01:07:17,033 --> 01:07:19,399
Of course. Else you'll get the abuse.

762
01:07:20,036 --> 01:07:22,800
Even when he comes he goes back
only after abusing some one.

763
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:28,067
Some one will give him that chance.
l'll call. - Okay.

764
01:07:35,918 --> 01:07:37,977
Our first drink. Cheers!

765
01:07:40,856 --> 01:07:45,259
Police. Police is nothing to us.

766
01:07:45,895 --> 01:07:49,763
Alexe! - Supriya!
- Long live Alexe! - Cheers!

767
01:07:54,970 --> 01:07:59,430
Are you teaching yoga?
- Have you come?

768
01:08:07,450 --> 01:08:13,685
You'll live for long years healthily.
80 years. This is what they say.

769
01:08:14,857 --> 01:08:17,951
This is the first time some one is
giving party as he doesn't have disease.

770
01:08:18,160 --> 01:08:20,390
This is the first time
l'm taking part in such a party.

771
01:08:20,596 --> 01:08:22,621
Good.
- Good.

772
01:08:23,099 --> 01:08:25,363
lt is her arrangements.
l'm not into this.

773
01:08:25,568 --> 01:08:28,059
This is what has to be celebrated.
l'm with Meera.

774
01:08:28,270 --> 01:08:33,799
When Alexe went to get report the tension
that l went through can't be expressed.

775
01:08:34,009 --> 01:08:38,241
l prayed to all the gods.
l called this sir for support.

776
01:08:38,848 --> 01:08:41,146
From some bar.
- Not some bar. lt is Koshy.

777
01:08:41,350 --> 01:08:44,717
From there after drinking
he talked nonsense.

778
01:08:45,187 --> 01:08:48,156
l got so angry. - Leave it Raghu.
Will you have a drink?

779
01:08:48,357 --> 01:08:51,656
l won't drink. lf l drink and
drive police will arrest me.

780
01:08:51,861 --> 01:08:55,092
Good. lf everyone thinks like this,
the work of police will be less.

781
01:08:55,297 --> 01:08:59,757
Yes. This is the social problem
that our country is facing now.

782
01:08:59,969 --> 01:09:04,099
Drive after drinking.
What is the night sight of our cities?

783
01:09:04,306 --> 01:09:06,570
After drinking and driving they
bang the car at some one.

784
01:09:06,775 --> 01:09:09,835
After drinking and driving they
go on top of high rise building.

785
01:09:10,045 --> 01:09:13,674
After drinking and driving they light
lamp for Ayappan. Keep quiet madam.

786
01:09:13,883 --> 01:09:16,852
This is to save the life of the people.
What do we get out of this?

787
01:09:17,052 --> 01:09:20,453
To save life is this LlC policy?

788
01:09:20,656 --> 01:09:24,524
ln Malayalam we say misuse of power.
Power corruption.

789
01:09:24,727 --> 01:09:29,187
They will hide in the dark to
rob the night travelers.

790
01:09:29,398 --> 01:09:35,303
Raghu! You shut up. That night thief
is not targeting one single person.

791
01:09:35,504 --> 01:09:40,464
He has no revenge. He won't smile
at the pray which falls in the trap.

792
01:09:40,676 --> 01:09:42,541
But you do that.

793
01:09:42,745 --> 01:09:45,543
lf it is that day incidence,
l did it purposely.

794
01:09:45,748 --> 01:09:51,380
You did it on the power of govt. uniform.
That is cheapness. Shrimati Supriya Raghavan!

795
01:09:51,987 --> 01:09:54,888
That day you gave me class on
how police should function.

796
01:09:55,090 --> 01:09:57,058
As a part of civic society
how we should function.

797
01:09:57,259 --> 01:10:00,956
You must not confront the interviewer
with this kind of cheap play.

798
01:10:01,363 --> 01:10:04,855
That is your thought from your
superiority complex.

799
01:10:05,134 --> 01:10:07,898
Else inferiority complex that l'm a woman.

800
01:10:08,103 --> 01:10:10,901
There is no need to specify as woman.
l'm not a chauvinist.

801
01:10:11,106 --> 01:10:12,232
l have seen people who say like that.

802
01:10:12,441 --> 01:10:16,070
Stupid must have said it. You must
have come upon only such people.

803
01:10:16,278 --> 01:10:20,180
To love and respect l don't see
whether is it a male or female.

804
01:10:20,382 --> 01:10:22,680
They must be intelligent and honest.

805
01:10:22,885 --> 01:10:25,581
That is the quality l admire in people.
Do you get me?

806
01:10:25,788 --> 01:10:27,016
Raghu! Come. Have a peg
and feel relaxed.

807
01:10:27,223 --> 01:10:29,248
l'm not saying anything.
There is no use of saying.

808
01:10:29,458 --> 01:10:30,925
Sorry, Supriya! You come.

809
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:34,024
Police can drink as much as they want.

810
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:39,600
To drop them govt. vehicle and govt.
servants are there.

811
01:10:42,805 --> 01:10:47,435
Give me. l'll drink and then only go.
Tell your police to wait on the way.

812
01:10:47,643 --> 01:10:49,008
What is the problem Raghu?

813
01:10:49,411 --> 01:10:50,935
lf you know the problem,
will you solve that?

814
01:10:51,146 --> 01:10:53,944
ThatO
- Will you solve? Don'tjust interfere.

815
01:10:54,149 --> 01:10:58,017
Drink how much ever you want.
Don't try to be smart.

816
01:10:58,587 --> 01:11:00,612
Just had a good evening.

817
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:07,621
Come.

818
01:11:12,968 --> 01:11:13,798
Nothing.

819
01:11:20,643 --> 01:11:26,138
Don't worry. lt is not him.
lt is his spirit inside.

820
01:11:36,058 --> 01:11:53,841
{ MACHAAN }

821
01:11:57,613 --> 01:12:02,846
Good morning! - Morning.
When did you come?

822
01:12:03,052 --> 01:12:09,184
Just now. Black coffee with cogniac.
What a way to start a day?

823
01:12:09,391 --> 01:12:10,358
Luck.

824
01:12:11,794 --> 01:12:14,024
Yesterday also as usual
l was a bore. lsn't it?

825
01:12:14,897 --> 01:12:18,094
That has become a routine.
When you are there that is the beauty.

826
01:12:18,534 --> 01:12:22,595
There has to be a fight.
- lt is not intentional Alexe.

827
01:12:23,872 --> 01:12:28,866
On seeing that SP madam. l had kept
ready a lengthy abuse for her.

828
01:12:29,078 --> 01:12:33,811
Leave it. She is a good friend.
When you come to know her you'll realize.

829
01:12:34,750 --> 01:12:36,877
Any way l spoilt the party.

830
01:12:39,855 --> 01:12:50,231
You escaped from that disease.
ln that Meera's celebration l spoilt that party.

831
01:12:50,699 --> 01:12:54,726
Party. That is no problem.
lt was a fake party.

832
01:12:57,172 --> 01:13:01,233
Fake?
- Yes. l and Dr. Suresh created it.

833
01:13:01,443 --> 01:13:05,004
lt was done for Meera. A stress relief.
Meera needed it.

834
01:13:06,281 --> 01:13:14,017
There is problem in the biopsy report.
lt is cancer.

835
01:13:18,427 --> 01:13:22,261
99% it can be cured.

836
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:28,265
On knowing the truth l had called
my brother and sister-in-law in US.

837
01:13:28,804 --> 01:13:30,669
Both are in Oncology department.

838
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:35,438
l mailed my reports also.
They told me to take the next flight.

839
01:13:35,811 --> 01:13:43,479
l have decided to go. lf l go there, l can avoid
this relatives show daily in the hospital.

840
01:13:47,322 --> 01:13:49,882
Why are you hiding this
information from Meera?

841
01:13:50,092 --> 01:13:51,957
Shouldn't she know about this?
- She should.

842
01:13:52,161 --> 01:13:57,622
But it is enough if she knows about it slowly.
l came early morning to tell you one matter.

843
01:13:57,833 --> 01:14:02,736
l have no fear about this disease.
l'm 99% confident that l'll survive.

844
01:14:05,274 --> 01:14:10,803
But 1 % on that fear l'm saying this.
lf l die, Meera and Sunny will become alone.

845
01:14:17,352 --> 01:14:21,550
Another man might come in
their life after some time.

846
01:14:21,790 --> 01:14:24,224
But Raghu l don't think it'll be you.

847
01:14:26,662 --> 01:14:31,429
l don't think it'll be possible for Meera.
lf she ever feels, l'll be so happy about that.

848
01:14:41,009 --> 01:14:45,912
Even if she decided to live alone Sunny,
doesn't he need a father?

849
01:14:46,215 --> 01:14:48,274
Can any other man become his father?

850
01:14:48,817 --> 01:14:52,344
Who ever it may be he can't
become you or me.

851
01:14:52,988 --> 01:14:55,786
He is a deaf and dumb boy.
He needs a father.

852
01:14:56,358 --> 01:14:58,519
l came to remember you that.

853
01:15:00,729 --> 01:15:05,928
You are in a hurry to drink and finish your life.
l want to tell you to remember his face.

854
01:15:06,635 --> 01:15:10,628
Think that these are his words
which he could not speak.

855
01:15:13,642 --> 01:15:15,371
Don't feel bad about it.

856
01:15:31,393 --> 01:15:33,884
You are in a hurry to finish your
life by drinking.

857
01:15:34,096 --> 01:15:36,894
ln between that think about his face.
That is what l have to say.

858
01:15:50,279 --> 01:15:52,747
Sir! You don't seem to be
in a mood today.

859
01:15:55,484 --> 01:15:59,079
lsn't mutual feeling is
what family life about?

860
01:15:59,288 --> 01:16:03,088
Yes. No secrecy in anything.
Only that relationship will with stand.

861
01:16:05,294 --> 01:16:07,524
lf husband is not feeling well,
shouldn't wife know about it?

862
01:16:07,729 --> 01:16:11,028
lf it is a decent disease,
she should surely know.

863
01:16:11,233 --> 01:16:13,929
lt is she who should know first.
- Exactly.

864
01:16:14,136 --> 01:16:17,333
But there is one thing sir.
This wife should be a brave party.

865
01:16:17,539 --> 01:16:21,202
lf it is my wife, the minute she
hears about it she'll start howling.

866
01:16:21,476 --> 01:16:24,104
She is not educated.
She is from village.

867
01:16:24,313 --> 01:16:27,942
This is an educated woman.
She won't collapse that easily.

868
01:16:28,317 --> 01:16:30,945
You can't tell about women.

869
01:16:33,088 --> 01:16:33,952
What?

870
01:16:34,423 --> 01:16:36,653
lt is they who have better
mental strength than us.

871
01:16:37,059 --> 01:16:39,459
Now about whom are you talking?

872
01:16:41,663 --> 01:16:43,290
Alexe!
- What happened to sir?

873
01:16:43,498 --> 01:16:49,459
He is having cancer.
He is not telling Meera about it.

874
01:16:49,738 --> 01:16:53,799
For that he must be having some reason.
May be he'll tell her at correct time.

875
01:16:55,677 --> 01:16:57,201
What is there to see time in this?

876
01:16:57,512 --> 01:16:59,309
You pour one more peg.
l need to go there.

877
01:16:59,548 --> 01:17:02,312
Already you have had 5 pegs. Do you need
to go and interfere in that problem?

878
01:17:04,519 --> 01:17:07,488
Will you go? Give me drink John.

879
01:17:15,831 --> 01:17:16,763
Where is Alexe?

880
01:17:16,965 --> 01:17:21,231
He is there. One tour operator has come.
A meeting with him. Shall l call him?

881
01:17:21,470 --> 01:17:25,930
No need. These tour operators
must be foreigners.

882
01:17:26,141 --> 01:17:28,336
Alexe's business must be in dollar.

883
01:17:28,543 --> 01:17:32,343
lt is for a group from UK. They want
to stay one week in our farm.

884
01:17:32,547 --> 01:17:37,450
Talking about farming he is having fun.
He is Achayan. Be careful.

885
01:17:37,653 --> 01:17:41,020
Nonsense. You are tight.

886
01:17:41,556 --> 01:17:43,114
That is what is needed.

887
01:17:45,227 --> 01:17:46,694
We need to be tight.

888
01:17:49,231 --> 01:17:53,292
Meera! Where has your courage gone?

889
01:17:53,669 --> 01:17:58,436
Alexe thinks that you are fragile.
lt is not his fault.

890
01:17:58,840 --> 01:18:03,209
He loves you very much.
lt is his over protectiveness.

891
01:18:04,246 --> 01:18:12,153
Seven years back you fought with
me and left with our son.

892
01:18:12,354 --> 01:18:18,315
You left at mid night from our
Bandra flat and went in a taxi.

893
01:18:18,794 --> 01:18:22,560
Where that guts of yours did go away?

894
01:18:22,764 --> 01:18:23,958
lt hasn't gone any where.

895
01:18:24,166 --> 01:18:28,398
Today l'm living in double confidence
and security than that.

896
01:18:28,603 --> 01:18:35,236
Then why is he hiding it from you?
You must know that Meera. One thing l'll say.

897
01:18:35,444 --> 01:18:39,380
The terminal illness might be
of husband or wife.

898
01:18:39,648 --> 01:18:42,583
They must fight it out together.

899
01:18:43,118 --> 01:18:46,246
Raghu! After having liquor in afternoon
what are you talking this?

900
01:18:47,622 --> 01:18:52,753
What terminal illness?
Whose matter is it? - Alexe's.

901
01:18:55,764 --> 01:18:58,756
He is having cancer.
Shouldn't you know about it?

902
01:18:59,768 --> 01:19:00,700
Alexe?

903
01:19:01,436 --> 01:19:07,272
Yes. Yes. He told me.

904
01:19:07,976 --> 01:19:10,342
He has not told you.
That also he told me.

905
01:19:11,780 --> 01:19:14,112
He lied to you so that you
should not suffer.

906
01:19:15,717 --> 01:19:17,947
He said the party was to
cool the situation.

907
01:19:18,153 --> 01:19:19,620
That is foolishness.

908
01:19:20,088 --> 01:19:23,785
There are smart doctors and
advanced medicines these days.

909
01:19:24,993 --> 01:19:28,121
This hiding and melodrama
is not needed.

910
01:19:28,330 --> 01:19:31,299
Raghu! Are you talking in your sense?
- Yes.

911
01:19:31,666 --> 01:19:34,726
Use the word conscience.
Both are same.

912
01:19:35,704 --> 01:19:41,472
Then one more matter is there.
Why go and get treated in America?

913
01:19:41,676 --> 01:19:45,237
All this is foolish. For what?

914
01:19:45,781 --> 01:19:51,845
There is nothing there which is not
available in Kerala. l just hate America.

915
01:19:52,621 --> 01:19:56,318
Politically America is the other name
of constipation and bad breath.

916
01:19:56,525 --> 01:20:00,894
A stupid country.
Did Columbus go there? ColumO

917
01:20:02,631 --> 01:20:05,429
Alexe! Have you come?
- Raghu!

918
01:20:07,803 --> 01:20:12,069
l told her. On hearing from
you only she'll get tensed.

919
01:20:12,274 --> 01:20:18,110
l'm an outsider. l can say.
You need not go to America.

920
01:20:18,713 --> 01:20:23,343
Treatment is there here. ln a time
of treating fever they treat this.

921
01:20:23,952 --> 01:20:27,513
During chemotherapy there is hair loss.
ln his case there is no fear of that too.

922
01:20:27,722 --> 01:20:33,524
Already he is bald.
- Alexe! Did you lie to me?

923
01:20:34,396 --> 01:20:37,854
l'll tell you. l can explain Meera.

924
01:20:52,180 --> 01:20:55,946
There tears will go.
Now she knows the matter.

925
01:20:56,585 --> 01:21:01,386
Don't forget what l said. No need
to go to America. We'll treat here.

926
01:21:01,823 --> 01:21:04,883
lf something happens,
it is better it takes place here.

927
01:21:06,595 --> 01:21:09,894
Thank you so much.
Let me sort this out.

928
01:21:10,599 --> 01:21:14,126
What is there to sort out?
You tell the guy to fix me a drink.

929
01:21:14,502 --> 01:21:17,403
Will you please leave now Raghu?

930
01:21:21,743 --> 01:21:29,013
That dialogue is not correct emotionally.
You must say push off. Get lost.

931
01:21:32,254 --> 01:21:35,849
You go and cry with your wife
and play melodrama.

932
01:21:36,958 --> 01:21:40,758
Cancer. What is this cancer man?

933
01:22:16,831 --> 01:22:20,790
ln some peculiar situations for our
sake some one else will have to talk.

934
01:22:21,002 --> 01:22:24,028
That is what l did.
Now they may be angry with me.

935
01:22:24,372 --> 01:22:26,636
No problem. lt'll change.
lf it doesn't change than also okay.

936
01:22:26,841 --> 01:22:27,466
What is it John?

937
01:22:27,676 --> 01:22:32,704
The one who went from here and talked
there is not you. lt is the liquor inside.

938
01:22:33,415 --> 01:22:36,145
Are you saying that l did this
on top of drink?

939
01:22:36,351 --> 01:22:40,253
Else you won't have gone there
and told what Alexe sir told you.

940
01:22:40,455 --> 01:22:44,323
You think. Due to drinking you
are losing that thinking power.

941
01:22:44,526 --> 01:22:46,255
Johns! Why are you saying like this?

942
01:22:46,461 --> 01:22:49,328
l have no eligibility to talk
to you like this.

943
01:22:49,597 --> 01:22:53,590
Customers ask. l pour and take money.
That is my job.

944
01:22:54,035 --> 01:22:56,435
l have lot of respect for you.
That is why l'm saying this.

945
01:22:56,638 --> 01:22:59,607
You must stay between us
for many more years.

946
01:22:59,975 --> 01:23:03,672
You see that Menon sir.
From 1 4 years l'm seeing you.

947
01:23:04,312 --> 01:23:07,770
After retirement he'll come daily.
He'll have 2 pegs.

948
01:23:07,983 --> 01:23:12,943
Not more than that. l have not seen
some stuttering or losing balance.

949
01:23:13,154 --> 01:23:15,850
He drinks liquor.
Liquor doesn't drink him.

950
01:23:16,057 --> 01:23:19,026
ln your case it is different.
Take a break.

951
01:23:19,227 --> 01:23:20,524
You get me a drink.

952
01:23:26,735 --> 01:23:31,638
From morning till night you consume
at least 10-1 4 pegs.

953
01:23:32,073 --> 01:23:34,041
How long will this go?

954
01:23:42,884 --> 01:24:03,261
{ MACHAAN }

955
01:24:09,344 --> 01:24:15,806
Don't say l'm an addict or alcoholic.
l won't surrender to anything totally.

956
01:24:16,017 --> 01:24:20,977
Nothing can control or make me a slave.
l'm sure about that captain.

957
01:24:23,425 --> 01:24:30,593
Raghu! You need to live.
Not for any one. To realize yourself.

958
01:24:31,666 --> 01:24:37,400
Like advising plumber Raghu
l can't advise you. l'll be boring.

959
01:24:50,185 --> 01:24:52,881
So you are saying that
l'm an alcoholic.

960
01:24:53,088 --> 01:24:58,185
Even if you don't realize the world around
you has been saying for a long time.

961
01:25:01,162 --> 01:25:04,620
lt is not that l didn't know.
l tried not to tell you.

962
01:25:05,667 --> 01:25:09,728
Raghu! You are an alcoholic.

963
01:25:41,369 --> 01:25:42,233
Take it.

964
01:25:48,376 --> 01:25:51,834
Guru!
- Samir!

965
01:25:52,046 --> 01:25:53,911
Where are you?
- l'm coming.

966
01:26:04,225 --> 01:26:08,025
l heard you had been admitted
to some hospital.

967
01:26:08,396 --> 01:26:10,523
Did they discharge you or you left?

968
01:26:13,902 --> 01:26:19,033
When blood increases in body
we vomit blood.

969
01:26:19,240 --> 01:26:22,141
That is my new discovery.
- Are you allowed to drink?

970
01:26:22,710 --> 01:26:25,702
ln this birth how much ever we are
destined to drink we must drink.

971
01:26:27,382 --> 01:26:31,716
l'll die decently. Naizam Ali's birth
and Ravi's death.

972
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:34,218
That is me. Shall l fix a drink for you?
- Not now.

973
01:26:34,422 --> 01:26:39,553
4 Vodka is inside.
- What is it? - Nothing.

974
01:26:41,763 --> 01:26:43,958
Raghuetta! l have taken a decision.

975
01:26:44,199 --> 01:26:49,330
l have stopped writing poetry.
l'll write songs for the movies.

976
01:26:49,537 --> 01:26:54,565
l'm going to start that. 2-3 intelligent
directors have given me offer.

977
01:26:56,110 --> 01:27:01,013
The song composed by Meera has been
taken by a film director like as it is.

978
01:27:01,216 --> 01:27:05,084
He gave me Rs.15000.
Think about it.

979
01:27:05,286 --> 01:27:10,485
What did Eadacheri and Vaila Pillai get here?
For 12 lines they are paying me 16.

980
01:27:10,892 --> 01:27:11,916
lt is like that only.

981
01:27:12,227 --> 01:27:16,027
Money given to prostitute he won't
give to wife for household expense.

982
01:27:16,898 --> 01:27:19,765
Today morning also l wrote one
and gave to Meera sister.

983
01:27:19,968 --> 01:27:21,367
l told her to put tune for that.

984
01:27:22,237 --> 01:27:23,795
She deserves that.

985
01:27:26,074 --> 01:27:31,842
The seeds that grow due to only rain
are there some. That is the soil of heart.

986
01:27:32,480 --> 01:27:35,779
Good. For some time you live like that.

987
01:27:36,150 --> 01:27:41,213
You need not beg and drink.
Were you discharged from hospital?

988
01:27:41,422 --> 01:27:43,947
l was discharged. They made a
liver function test on me.

989
01:27:44,158 --> 01:27:45,955
Seeing that do you know
what the doctor said?

990
01:27:46,294 --> 01:27:48,285
Edge of the liver burst.

991
01:27:48,496 --> 01:27:51,522
No doctor in lndia will use such language.
Leave that.

992
01:27:52,066 --> 01:27:55,729
Raghuetta! No one has told me
where l should die.

993
01:27:56,004 --> 01:27:57,904
l have not promised any one.

994
01:28:01,009 --> 01:28:05,070
What is it? Samir!

995
01:28:18,192 --> 01:28:24,597
Samir! Are you alright? Samir!

996
01:28:27,368 --> 01:28:28,392
What is it?

997
01:28:30,204 --> 01:28:33,002
Nothing. Awound in the throat.

998
01:28:36,644 --> 01:28:40,080
Sit! Throat wound.
Come here. Come.

999
01:28:43,885 --> 01:28:46,513
Body will eject when level of blood goes up.

1000
01:28:57,565 --> 01:28:58,964
Mother!

1001
01:29:15,783 --> 01:29:21,085
Samir lastly wrote the poetry
!The time when death comes!.

1002
01:29:21,289 --> 01:29:24,884
Raghunanthan translated it
to some other language.

1003
01:29:29,897 --> 01:29:41,570
The time when death comes you
must sit near me for some time.

1004
01:29:42,944 --> 01:29:55,414
The fingers which have scooped
hot coal are numb with cold.

1005
01:29:56,724 --> 01:30:08,158
ln the end it is trying to caress you.
ln my last breath l could smell your scent.!

1006
01:30:08,369 --> 01:30:19,940
!The time when death comes
you must sit near me for some time.

1007
01:30:23,584 --> 01:30:34,859
ln the eyes which will never open your
image is permanently there.

1008
01:30:36,664 --> 01:30:48,804
These ears won't hear even a single tune.
l'm closing it with the stamp of your voice.

1009
01:30:49,677 --> 01:31:00,645
ln my thoughts intelligence and
thoughts are pouring clear thinking.

1010
01:31:01,989 --> 01:31:13,594
The time when death comes you
must sit near me for some time.

1011
01:31:15,102 --> 01:31:21,666
My sweet kisses will increase with
the spelling of your name again and again.

1012
01:31:21,876 --> 01:31:26,836
With deep foot steps love
is coming my way.

1013
01:31:28,749 --> 01:31:54,599
My ways are coming your way love
for my foot prints to make a mark.

1014
01:31:54,909 --> 01:32:07,549
That is enough to resurrect his
body which is buried in soil.

1015
01:32:08,089 --> 01:32:19,728
The time when death comes you
must sit near me for some time.

1016
01:32:20,401 --> 01:32:32,245
The time when death comes you
must sit near me for some time.!

1017
01:32:37,251 --> 01:32:45,386
{ MACHAAN }

1018
01:33:17,725 --> 01:33:19,249
Sorry!
- No problem.

1019
01:33:19,493 --> 01:33:21,120
How are you Johnson?
- Fine.

1020
01:33:21,329 --> 01:33:26,357
lt is a week. What should l get you?
- A glass of water.

1021
01:33:36,844 --> 01:33:38,038
Thank you!

1022
01:33:55,029 --> 01:34:05,496
l'm in Kochi. l'll take sir to Trichur.
Night l'll reach Palakkadu. Okay.

1023
01:34:17,051 --> 01:34:19,679
Raghu!
- Where were you?

1024
01:34:21,288 --> 01:34:24,689
How did you enter?
- For trespassing like this please forgive us.

1025
01:34:24,892 --> 01:34:28,851
Comrade Pangajam told the
place of key in old memory.

1026
01:34:29,230 --> 01:34:31,698
We opened the lock with that
and entered.

1027
01:34:32,733 --> 01:34:33,529
What is there?

1028
01:34:33,734 --> 01:34:36,862
Even if you don't get the key you
can break open the door and enter.

1029
01:34:37,071 --> 01:34:40,871
ln Kerala no man of wisdom has
broken the door and entered.

1030
01:34:41,075 --> 01:34:42,372
What is the reason for that?
- What?

1031
01:34:42,576 --> 01:34:44,703
He is not healthy enough.

1032
01:34:47,581 --> 01:34:50,982
We are coming from Samir's house.
We can't bear it.

1033
01:34:51,185 --> 01:34:53,449
His mother and grand mother
were crying that much.

1034
01:34:54,355 --> 01:35:00,726
Death has a peculiar plan.
- ln Samir's case it was not a wonder.

1035
01:35:01,195 --> 01:35:05,825
We must call it as cruel.
Why did that young guy die?

1036
01:35:07,601 --> 01:35:11,298
Doctor had told him not
to even see liquor.

1037
01:35:11,872 --> 01:35:14,397
He ran away from hospital
and came to Raghu.

1038
01:35:14,775 --> 01:35:19,678
That isjust a reason.
Venu! People say he drank and died.

1039
01:35:19,880 --> 01:35:25,750
Thinking of that l feel bad.
Time allotted to him on this earth was over.

1040
01:35:25,953 --> 01:35:27,978
Sir! Don't become spiritual.
lt'll be a bore.

1041
01:35:28,189 --> 01:35:33,183
Shall l make a peg for you?
Made by govt. Low rate. More powerful.

1042
01:35:33,694 --> 01:35:34,888
No need.

1043
01:35:35,129 --> 01:35:38,530
You drink only branded.
But here only empty bottles are there.

1044
01:35:38,733 --> 01:35:39,825
ls this a hobby?

1045
01:35:40,034 --> 01:35:46,496
These are gone days Ravietta.
lnside each bottle. Used eternal drinks.

1046
01:35:46,707 --> 01:35:50,006
Shall l make a drink star boy?
- No Thomacha.

1047
01:35:50,211 --> 01:35:53,112
Brand is not the issue.
l'm not drinking.

1048
01:35:53,314 --> 01:35:57,114
What kind of talk is this?
lf not today when will you drink?

1049
01:35:57,651 --> 01:36:00,711
l decided not to have.
That's all. Don't compel me.

1050
01:36:01,255 --> 01:36:02,449
You know me.

1051
01:36:03,724 --> 01:36:06,056
He died in this floor.

1052
01:36:10,131 --> 01:36:15,034
We must be able to see our friends
in heart. Then what is there now?.

1053
01:36:15,236 --> 01:36:18,467
When he died no one said that it was a
loss which can never be fulfilled.

1054
01:36:18,672 --> 01:36:23,200
No one gave him last salute. l didn't see
any politician or minister that time.

1055
01:36:23,611 --> 01:36:26,136
Dog's son who have no
knowledge of education.

1056
01:36:26,347 --> 01:36:30,477
Only those who know what he
was know the value of his loss.

1057
01:36:30,684 --> 01:36:34,381
His humor sense. The timing.

1058
01:36:34,922 --> 01:36:37,322
Do you remember when academy
award was declared?

1059
01:36:37,525 --> 01:36:40,255
He wrote a one line letter
to academy chairman.

1060
01:36:40,461 --> 01:36:45,990
l remember. l won't repeat this.
Don't award me any more.

1061
01:36:48,803 --> 01:36:51,670
Did you stop drinking seeing his death?

1062
01:36:53,808 --> 01:36:59,769
l didn't say l have stopped. l felt revolted.
l'm bored. lt has been since so long.

1063
01:37:00,548 --> 01:37:03,176
Sir! We have to leave.
- We must go.

1064
01:37:04,285 --> 01:37:09,018
ln Trichur l have some work. Bye!
- Take the bottle.

1065
01:37:09,990 --> 01:37:13,517
Ok. - Raghu!
- Okay, bye!

1066
01:37:16,063 --> 01:37:17,621
Raghu! l'll phone you.

1067
01:37:19,834 --> 01:37:25,704
Don't hate drinks. R.L.Stevens had written this.
Haven't you read this?

1068
01:37:28,576 --> 01:37:36,108
Wine is bottled poetry.

1069
01:37:40,688 --> 01:37:43,384
Liquor is bottled poetry.

1070
01:38:08,949 --> 01:38:26,391
{ MACHAAN }

1071
01:39:26,193 --> 01:39:30,596
Shit! l thought of stopping drinking.

1072
01:39:30,798 --> 01:39:34,666
For that water supply has been stopped.
Plumber Manian.

1073
01:39:34,868 --> 01:39:36,335
Where are you, bastard?

1074
01:39:44,378 --> 01:39:47,245
Sir! ln all other places of
colony water is coming.

1075
01:39:47,448 --> 01:39:50,281
lt must be. You see the matter here.

1076
01:39:50,484 --> 01:39:52,850
Did you forget to pay the bill?
Has it been cut off?

1077
01:39:53,053 --> 01:39:56,022
l did pay the bill. You go and see.

1078
01:40:01,996 --> 01:40:03,293
Ayappa!

1079
01:40:17,344 --> 01:40:20,370
ls there no water in any tap?
- Due to that only l called you.

1080
01:40:21,048 --> 01:40:23,380
No drinking water?
- No.

1081
01:40:24,118 --> 01:40:26,643
lt is not possible.

1082
01:41:02,723 --> 01:41:06,819
Before starting the work in the
morning this is a custom.

1083
01:41:23,644 --> 01:41:26,010
After having one peg if l take this,
l get the effect of 3 pegs.

1084
01:41:28,182 --> 01:41:30,514
You wait sir. The work will be
over in 2 minutes.

1085
01:42:19,867 --> 01:42:21,164
Raghu sir!

1086
01:42:50,464 --> 01:42:53,627
Simple case. The valve of main
line has to be changed.

1087
01:42:54,067 --> 01:42:56,695
Tomorrow l'll come and do it.
- What is your charge?

1088
01:42:56,904 --> 01:42:58,633
What charge is there for this?

1089
01:43:02,042 --> 01:43:03,304
ls there nothing?
- No.

1090
01:43:04,244 --> 01:43:06,974
Can't you sell these empty bottles?
- You go.

1091
01:43:46,954 --> 01:43:47,978
Sit down.

1092
01:43:52,960 --> 01:43:53,426
Alexe!

1093
01:43:53,627 --> 01:43:57,085
He and Sunny have gone out. One of
Alexe's cousins is going to US.

1094
01:43:57,297 --> 01:43:58,924
See off party.
- Didn't you go?

1095
01:43:59,366 --> 01:44:03,166
l didn't feel like. Tired. Today whole day
l was in recording theatre.

1096
01:44:03,470 --> 01:44:06,439
The morning of the day Samir
died he had given me a song.

1097
01:44:06,640 --> 01:44:07,607
He told me to tune it.

1098
01:44:08,575 --> 01:44:13,603
The seeds that grow due to rain.
There are some in the soil of my heart.

1099
01:44:13,814 --> 01:44:15,611
Yes. Did you see that?

1100
01:44:16,583 --> 01:44:17,447
He told me.

1101
01:44:17,985 --> 01:44:20,954
He told many things coming home.
ln that he mentioned these two lines also.

1102
01:44:22,089 --> 01:44:24,853
Today while coming l thought
of those lines. Him too.

1103
01:44:26,493 --> 01:44:29,724
Did you tune it?.
- Yes. Recording is also over.

1104
01:44:29,997 --> 01:44:33,694
Poor thing. lf he had been alive,
he would have drunk and scolded me.

1105
01:44:33,900 --> 01:44:36,960
On first hearing he'll say not like this.
Not like that.

1106
01:44:37,170 --> 01:44:39,195
This is not correct.
That is not correct.

1107
01:44:41,475 --> 01:44:44,308
Next day it'll change.
Everything will be forgotten.

1108
01:44:45,178 --> 01:44:50,639
Yes. lt is possible by only Meera sister.
He'll say you are the best. Poor man.

1109
01:44:52,286 --> 01:44:53,583
Can l hear?

1110
01:44:55,589 --> 01:44:56,385
Sure.

1111
01:44:58,558 --> 01:45:02,255
The seeds that grow due to rain.
There are some in the soil of my heart.

1112
01:45:02,462 --> 01:45:04,327
ln his thought l had drinks today.

1113
01:45:04,765 --> 01:45:07,165
Do you need one?
- No.

1114
01:45:07,768 --> 01:45:12,330
For this night and for Samir l should have
kept this night aside without drinking.

1115
01:45:12,873 --> 01:45:16,832
Without keeping a drop l have
drank for this full life time.

1116
01:45:17,711 --> 01:45:20,737
That is sad.
- You play it.

1117
01:45:31,491 --> 01:45:40,092
{ MACHAAN }

1118
01:45:42,269 --> 01:45:52,543
!The seeds that grows due to rain.
There are some in the soil of my heart.

1119
01:45:52,879 --> 01:46:03,380
lnside my soul there is a light
which is burning due to love.

1120
01:46:08,762 --> 01:46:18,899
The seeds that grows due to rain.
There are some in the soil of my heart.

1121
01:46:19,373 --> 01:46:29,749
lnside my soul there is a light
which is burning due to love.

1122
01:46:40,627 --> 01:46:50,935
My lips which are like flower
petals are waiting for a kiss.

1123
01:46:51,138 --> 01:47:01,605
ln my lips there are words
of love which l never told.

1124
01:47:01,815 --> 01:47:13,454
Just like that they are staring
sitting opposite to each other.

1125
01:47:17,631 --> 01:47:27,734
The seeds that grows due to rain.
There are some in the soil of my heart.

1126
01:47:28,308 --> 01:47:38,980
lnside my soul there is a light
which is burning due to love.

1127
01:47:49,429 --> 01:47:59,998
The times are scratching the
soil in the banks of my heart.

1128
01:48:00,207 --> 01:48:09,275
Like silent statues standing
in the silent night.

1129
01:48:09,483 --> 01:48:13,351
For a night like this it
should have been left over.

1130
01:48:22,662 --> 01:48:26,621
lt is good that l stopped drinking.
Else l would have raped you.

1131
01:48:30,504 --> 01:48:31,698
Good night!

1132
01:48:33,340 --> 01:48:35,365
The one who was my wife at one time.

1133
01:48:36,977 --> 01:48:40,310
We'll meet each other in the next birth.
My beloved!

1134
01:48:50,190 --> 01:49:00,725
!The times are scratching the soil
in the banks of my heart.

1135
01:49:00,934 --> 01:49:11,242
Like silent statues standing in the silent night.
With silence we're separating from each other.

1136
01:49:11,444 --> 01:49:16,814
Like the silent ness of the sea.

1137
01:49:21,955 --> 01:49:31,921
The seeds that grows due to rain.
There are some in the soil of my heart.

1138
01:49:32,566 --> 01:49:42,771
lnside my soul there is a light
which is burning due to love.!

1139
01:49:47,314 --> 01:49:49,441
What is it Pangajam?
- Give me Rs.500 sir.

1140
01:49:49,649 --> 01:49:51,879
What happened?
- Manichettan.

1141
01:49:53,253 --> 01:49:54,117
What did he do?

1142
01:49:54,521 --> 01:49:57,957
He brought money at home. lt is missing
and he blames that he has stolen it.

1143
01:49:58,158 --> 01:49:59,682
Saying that he hit him.

1144
01:50:01,828 --> 01:50:05,889
After drinking when he comes home
he'll hide his money somewhere.

1145
01:50:06,266 --> 01:50:09,292
After sleep when he gets up he'll
forget where he kept the money.

1146
01:50:09,603 --> 01:50:10,797
Today also it was the same story.

1147
01:50:11,004 --> 01:50:14,303
While he was crying that time
itself he got his money.

1148
01:50:14,507 --> 01:50:19,308
Without looking back he went away.
l think stitch might be needed.

1149
01:50:19,512 --> 01:50:23,141
There is no money at home.
Give me Rs.500.

1150
01:50:23,350 --> 01:50:24,578
You get into the car with him.

1151
01:50:24,784 --> 01:50:26,979
No need. There will be
blood smear in the seat.

1152
01:50:27,187 --> 01:50:29,212
You do as l say.
Get into the car. - Sir!

1153
01:50:31,925 --> 01:50:36,828
Get in. Get in.
- Get in my son.

1154
01:50:58,251 --> 01:50:59,343
They have stitched.

1155
01:50:59,519 --> 01:51:04,718
They said we can go after some time.
From morning my son has not eaten anything.

1156
01:51:04,891 --> 01:51:09,191
l'll get something and come. No need.
l have money left from what you gave earlier.

1157
01:51:09,396 --> 01:51:12,695
Keep this too. Have it.
- So much money. Sir!

1158
01:51:32,819 --> 01:51:35,049
ls there pain?
- A bit.

1159
01:51:44,998 --> 01:51:59,846
{ MACHAAN }

1160
01:52:07,287 --> 01:52:08,413
Good night.

1161
01:52:11,791 --> 01:52:13,019
Meera!

1162
01:52:14,728 --> 01:52:18,255
Good night!
- Night.

1163
01:52:21,067 --> 01:52:24,264
Meera! - Thank you!
Will you come tomorrow?.

1164
01:52:24,637 --> 01:52:25,763
Okay.

1165
01:52:39,552 --> 01:52:41,110
Shall l arrest your plumber tomorrow?.

1166
01:52:41,321 --> 01:52:43,721
They'll take him to town Cl office.
l'll also go there.

1167
01:52:44,657 --> 01:52:48,957
Not needed. Sorry! l'm not into debating.
l'm just telling.

1168
01:52:49,596 --> 01:52:54,226
Don't think that an alcoholic
is a psycho.

1169
01:52:58,037 --> 01:53:01,473
ln police language if you man
handle him he can be threatened.

1170
01:53:01,808 --> 01:53:03,469
A proper treatment is what needed.

1171
01:53:03,676 --> 01:53:06,975
Sir! We also know that scientifically
this is what is correct.

1172
01:53:07,180 --> 01:53:09,876
But in some cases when they
are hit they become alright.

1173
01:53:12,318 --> 01:53:15,412
l second it.
They'll remember that beating.

1174
01:53:15,688 --> 01:53:18,657
Next time he won't lift his hand
to beat his son. - Correct.

1175
01:53:20,560 --> 01:53:24,155
Raghu! l'm an ordinary
police constable's daughter.

1176
01:53:24,364 --> 01:53:29,324
More than academic training
my back ground sense helps me.

1177
01:53:29,636 --> 01:53:30,830
lt is up to you.

1178
01:53:31,137 --> 01:53:33,002
There is nothing wrong in
calling and warning him.

1179
01:53:39,479 --> 01:53:41,743
lnvestigate and give me the report.
- Okay.

1180
01:53:46,553 --> 01:53:48,350
Who is it?.
- l'm a plumber.

1181
01:53:48,555 --> 01:53:50,455
They said there is leak. l must come.
- What is your name?

1182
01:53:50,657 --> 01:53:53,956
Manian. Manian!
- Yes.

1183
01:53:54,294 --> 01:53:56,854
The problem is in ASP officer's room.
You come. - Tools.

1184
01:53:57,063 --> 01:53:58,928
You can take that later on.
You come.

1185
01:54:04,838 --> 01:54:06,032
Come.

1186
01:54:11,644 --> 01:54:14,704
Where do you belong to?
- My home town is Thiruvananthapuram.

1187
01:54:14,914 --> 01:54:17,883
lt is how long since you are here?
- lt is some years since l came here.

1188
01:54:18,918 --> 01:54:20,943
How many children do you have?
- Three.

1189
01:54:21,221 --> 01:54:23,985
ln that do you unnecessarily
hit the elder one?

1190
01:54:24,190 --> 01:54:24,815
No, madam!

1191
01:54:29,195 --> 01:54:34,656
l could have made any of my junior do this.
Do you know why l hit you?

1192
01:54:34,868 --> 01:54:38,167
You remember getting hit by a woman.

1193
01:54:38,838 --> 01:54:43,070
lf l come to know that you hit him again,
l'll bash you up.

1194
01:54:43,276 --> 01:54:45,176
Did you understand?
- Yes. - Go.

1195
01:55:02,028 --> 01:55:03,655
Do you know what this is Binoy?

1196
01:55:03,930 --> 01:55:04,988
Are you making fun of me?

1197
01:55:05,198 --> 01:55:06,426
You tell me.
Don't waste time.

1198
01:55:06,633 --> 01:55:08,100
You can abuse me as much as you want.

1199
01:55:08,301 --> 01:55:12,761
Showing a camera if you ask a camera
man what it is, it is a great insult.

1200
01:55:14,974 --> 01:55:18,273
Binoy! All this while it was a camera.

1201
01:55:18,478 --> 01:55:21,447
From now onwards this is your eye.
Your third eye.

1202
01:55:22,015 --> 01:55:24,176
For my sake you must see through this.

1203
01:55:24,918 --> 01:55:26,715
You opened up my eyes.
- What?

1204
01:55:29,789 --> 01:55:32,383
Before taking this you must know
one thing. You need to know.

1205
01:55:32,592 --> 01:55:34,287
ls it technical?
- Coconut.

1206
01:55:35,328 --> 01:55:39,389
Before doing an auspicious thing
do you know why we break coconut?

1207
01:55:39,732 --> 01:55:41,461
lt is a coconut which is meant
to be broken.

1208
01:55:41,668 --> 01:55:42,794
Buffalo!
- Yes, sir!

1209
01:55:43,002 --> 01:55:45,402
Self ego. lt is something to be destroyed.

1210
01:55:45,838 --> 01:55:47,465
You must not think that you
are a big camera man.

1211
01:55:47,674 --> 01:55:51,906
You must have the politeness
to understand that inside you.

1212
01:55:52,111 --> 01:55:52,975
Do you get me?

1213
01:56:01,754 --> 01:56:06,316
You must go to the nearby beverages outlet.

1214
01:56:06,526 --> 01:56:09,154
Have you decided to start?
Good. - ldiot!

1215
01:56:09,362 --> 01:56:12,331
Not to buy drinks.
You are going there to shoot.

1216
01:56:12,565 --> 01:56:16,501
From morning till night beverages
outlet are open.

1217
01:56:16,703 --> 01:56:21,003
Outside that many stand in a queue of chain.
From there they go to different directions.

1218
01:56:21,207 --> 01:56:24,404
You must shoot their life.
- Sir!

1219
01:56:24,978 --> 01:56:27,503
So, start camera.

1220
01:56:43,229 --> 01:56:46,357
The subscriber you are trying
to connect is not there.

1221
01:56:46,566 --> 01:56:52,698
l need not connect to any one. At this age
l don't want to go tojail for molestation.

1222
01:56:53,239 --> 01:56:55,969
To connect.
Don't l have any other work?

1223
01:56:56,676 --> 01:56:59,372
With my own wife l don't have connection.

1224
01:56:59,579 --> 01:57:02,878
Then with outsiders what connection
do l have?

1225
01:57:03,416 --> 01:57:05,543
Call me later on.
l'm in a meeting.

1226
01:57:09,255 --> 01:57:11,951
Don't expect me boss.
Wife is sick.

1227
01:57:12,258 --> 01:57:15,716
Now l'm in hospital. l'll come
to work only on Monday.

1228
01:57:16,763 --> 01:57:21,325
What? lf there is no rice you need
not cook. You remain starving.

1229
01:57:21,834 --> 01:57:25,565
l have told you not to call me
in my office. Keep the phone.

1230
01:57:27,440 --> 01:57:28,668
One full for me.

1231
01:57:32,045 --> 01:57:33,410
Pour water in this.

1232
01:57:47,226 --> 01:57:49,421
Dear! What is this programme?

1233
01:57:49,629 --> 01:57:51,756
Nothing. l'm taking a photo of yours.

1234
01:57:52,799 --> 01:57:55,029
Take photo but you must
take permission.

1235
01:57:55,735 --> 01:57:59,762
Excuse me can l take a picture?
Like that you must ask.

1236
01:57:59,972 --> 01:58:02,941
That is decency. Take it.

1237
01:58:08,147 --> 01:58:09,114
Pour it.

1238
01:58:10,016 --> 01:58:12,382
Mastery! He is notjust taking photo.

1239
01:58:12,652 --> 01:58:18,181
This is video camera.
- ls it so? - No.

1240
01:58:18,491 --> 01:58:21,722
ln this both still and video can be taken.
- Give me that.

1241
01:58:22,662 --> 01:58:24,630
lt must be television people.

1242
01:58:27,100 --> 01:58:32,402
Guys from standard family are standing
before the beverages shop in queue.

1243
01:58:32,605 --> 01:58:33,799
Will you show that in television?

1244
01:58:34,006 --> 01:58:37,203
lf you insult decent people,
l'll break your legs.

1245
01:58:37,410 --> 01:58:40,072
l'm not from television channel.
For fun l'm taking this.

1246
01:58:40,279 --> 01:58:41,541
For fun.

1247
01:58:41,747 --> 01:58:45,148
Will you take camera to the place
where your father's dead boy is bathed?

1248
01:58:45,351 --> 01:58:50,482
Bash him up.
- Mother!

1249
01:58:51,757 --> 01:58:55,158
lt is sometime since he is
moving around with camera.

1250
01:58:55,361 --> 01:59:02,494
Don't leave him. - Hit him.
- What are you doing?

1251
01:59:02,802 --> 01:59:04,827
Hit him nicely.
- Leave me.

1252
01:59:05,037 --> 01:59:06,834
Are you trying to stop us from
entering our house?

1253
01:59:07,039 --> 01:59:11,100
Hit him well.
- Run away. Police! Police.

1254
01:59:11,310 --> 01:59:12,004
What is it?

1255
01:59:24,657 --> 01:59:30,118
A day. A day in the life of
a chronic alcoholic.

1256
01:59:31,230 --> 01:59:36,190
That will be our next project.
A guy who has fully addicted to liquor.

1257
01:59:36,402 --> 01:59:38,870
One full day with him.
We'll shoot without his knowledge.

1258
01:59:39,405 --> 01:59:41,032
You have to just ask
when l will get beating.

1259
01:59:41,407 --> 01:59:44,035
lt is yourjob to see to it that
you don't get beating.

1260
01:59:44,243 --> 01:59:49,374
You move more sensibly.
- One man. Who is this one man?

1261
01:59:50,750 --> 01:59:53,150
A representative of many Malayali's.

1262
01:59:53,920 --> 01:59:58,789
They give 3/4th of their salary
in beverages outlet.

1263
01:59:59,025 --> 02:00:01,960
That way they buy ticket to death
and are in a hurry for that.

1264
02:00:04,630 --> 02:00:07,963
Our hero is Manian. Plumber Manian.

1265
02:00:08,601 --> 02:00:09,898
Will he agree for that?

1266
02:00:10,102 --> 02:00:12,730
ldiot! Without his knowledge you
must move with him and do that.

1267
02:00:12,939 --> 02:00:17,740
Candid cam show. Mobile phone.
Handy cam. We can use pen camera.

1268
02:00:17,944 --> 02:00:20,412
ls it possible to follow?.

1269
02:00:21,781 --> 02:00:27,242
Follow him means for some days
you work with him as his helper.

1270
02:00:27,620 --> 02:00:30,088
You'll learn a new profession and
our work will also get done.

1271
02:00:30,690 --> 02:00:32,988
For that you must change this
stylish look of yours.

1272
02:00:33,192 --> 02:00:34,591
You must look like a poor guy.

1273
02:00:49,242 --> 02:00:51,767
Sir! Does he belong to your place?
- Yes, Mania!

1274
02:00:52,311 --> 02:00:54,108
l know his father.

1275
02:00:57,583 --> 02:01:00,552
He is very sad that this boy
has not come up in life.

1276
02:01:01,120 --> 02:01:05,216
You keep him as your helper.
He'll learn a profession.

1277
02:01:05,424 --> 02:01:08,359
You need not pay him. l'll see to that.
- No problem. Let him be with me.

1278
02:01:11,998 --> 02:01:16,799
l have heard that he drinks. lf you see
anything like that, you send him away.

1279
02:01:17,003 --> 02:01:20,461
l'll not send him away.
l'll bash him up. Did you hear?

1280
02:01:20,673 --> 02:01:23,801
Okay, brother!
- Come here. Behave properly.

1281
02:01:24,010 --> 02:01:25,637
Don't call me brother.
Call me as Mestry

1282
02:01:27,146 --> 02:01:29,137
Raghu, sir! Let him come
with me now itself.

1283
02:01:29,348 --> 02:01:30,815
Okay, your wish.

1284
02:01:38,791 --> 02:01:43,819
lt is guru. Remember that. What ever
he does you must take down all that.

1285
02:01:44,030 --> 02:01:45,327
Did you hear?
- Sir! He is a real drunkard.

1286
02:01:45,531 --> 02:01:47,328
Now itself he is drunk.
- lsn't that our subject?

1287
02:01:47,533 --> 02:01:48,158
Come on.

1288
02:01:56,375 --> 02:02:00,277
Hello! What hello? When
l call you will you say hello?

1289
02:02:00,479 --> 02:02:02,310
You must ask what it is.
Did you understand?

1290
02:02:03,716 --> 02:02:07,345
Why did l call you? l wanted to call.
Where are you now?.

1291
02:02:08,054 --> 02:02:13,617
Job? l'll stop your entire job soon.
Don'tjustify yourself.

1292
02:02:15,127 --> 02:02:16,185
Keep the phone down.

1293
02:02:24,937 --> 02:02:25,869
Hold this.

1294
02:02:31,210 --> 02:02:41,984
{ MACHAAN }

1295
02:02:47,259 --> 02:02:48,226
Come here.

1296
02:02:48,594 --> 02:02:50,391
Have you seen my children?
- Yes.

1297
02:02:50,996 --> 02:02:54,488
lsn't younger daughter fair like me?
They have got your glamour.

1298
02:02:54,700 --> 02:02:57,692
That is true.
The elder one is dark. lsn't it?

1299
02:02:57,903 --> 02:02:59,234
Slightly.
- Not slightly.

1300
02:02:59,438 --> 02:03:02,566
He is dark. How did that happen?
l'm fair and she is also fair.

1301
02:03:02,775 --> 02:03:05,073
Mestry! There are fair and dark people.

1302
02:03:05,644 --> 02:03:08,738
Don't try to teach me.
Listen to just what l say. Okay?

1303
02:03:09,448 --> 02:03:13,248
That boy is not my child.
- Yes. lt is true.

1304
02:03:14,720 --> 02:03:16,745
ln the 8th month she had delivery.

1305
02:03:17,356 --> 02:03:21,258
That means when she married me
she was pregnant.

1306
02:03:21,460 --> 02:03:24,429
Did you understand?
What are you doing there? - Ladder.

1307
02:03:24,630 --> 02:03:28,361
l'm talking about an important matter.
Are you climbing a ladder? Come here.

1308
02:03:31,637 --> 02:03:34,538
l know the guy. He is another
disciple of our Mestry.

1309
02:03:34,907 --> 02:03:38,707
Now he has come from Dubai.
Yesterday l saw him.

1310
02:03:41,213 --> 02:03:44,614
Did you see?
He is also a disciple like you.

1311
02:03:45,217 --> 02:03:47,947
He went to Dubai at the correct time.
He earned money.

1312
02:03:48,154 --> 02:03:53,615
You arejust roaming around.
Good for nothing.

1313
02:03:53,826 --> 02:03:55,953
Mania! Are Pangajam and
your son well off?

1314
02:03:56,162 --> 02:03:58,630
Pangajam doesn't have only one son.
She has other children too.

1315
02:03:59,165 --> 02:04:02,794
There is lacking in having children.

1316
02:04:06,605 --> 02:04:08,300
l can't stop laughing.

1317
02:04:12,111 --> 02:04:17,208
He'll come to see her and his son.
Did you see this?

1318
02:04:18,350 --> 02:04:20,545
That day l'll kill both of them.

1319
02:04:23,589 --> 02:04:25,284
Didn't you come to learn work here?
- Yes.

1320
02:04:25,491 --> 02:04:26,651
Did you give me fees?
- No.

1321
02:04:26,859 --> 02:04:28,326
Go and get a quarter.

1322
02:04:29,128 --> 02:04:30,993
That supervisor abused
a lot and went from here.

1323
02:04:31,197 --> 02:04:32,494
Before he comes don't we
need to finish all this?

1324
02:04:32,698 --> 02:04:36,156
l'll manage him. You go and
get thing. What is this?

1325
02:04:36,368 --> 02:04:39,428
Ladder.
- Stop playing with ladder and get liquor.

1326
02:04:40,873 --> 02:04:42,568
l should be blamed for taking him.

1327
02:04:44,210 --> 02:04:47,179
Did you see this?
That day l'll kill both of them.

1328
02:04:47,546 --> 02:04:50,515
l'm scared he'll kill that sister.

1329
02:04:51,717 --> 02:04:53,184
lt may happen.

1330
02:04:54,220 --> 02:05:01,786
Daily we hear so many news.
An alcoholic has this psychic disease.

1331
02:05:02,595 --> 02:05:05,530
A kind of paranoid disorder.
Othello Syndrome.

1332
02:05:05,731 --> 02:05:09,531
Mobet Clerisy. ln medical science
they call like that.

1333
02:05:10,436 --> 02:05:13,701
Too much liquor will affect
a man's sexual potential.

1334
02:05:14,740 --> 02:05:19,302
This is the side effect of that.
They start doubting their wife.

1335
02:05:19,411 --> 02:05:21,936
His liquor filled brain will
form a lover to his wife.

1336
02:05:22,147 --> 02:05:24,308
From his surrounding he'll find a guy.

1337
02:05:24,850 --> 02:05:30,982
They'll give that image to this lover.
But he'll never try to fight with him.

1338
02:05:31,957 --> 02:05:38,624
Haven't you seen in many news it is
not the lover it is the wife who dies.

1339
02:05:39,131 --> 02:05:42,123
ln that entire place a wife is like
a house bred animal.

1340
02:05:43,102 --> 02:05:49,507
A silent animal which is hunted
without allowing her to speak.

1341
02:05:51,277 --> 02:05:54,075
We must intrude Manian's house.

1342
02:05:56,081 --> 02:06:02,919
We know that it is indecent. But we
must know the Manian inside the house.

1343
02:06:29,415 --> 02:06:30,780
Shall l make a try?

1344
02:06:42,194 --> 02:06:45,493
Did you get this talent from generation?
Else actually is this your job?

1345
02:06:45,998 --> 02:06:47,295
You must say this.

1346
02:06:47,499 --> 02:06:51,629
l'm with that plumber hearing
his abuse and nonsense.

1347
02:06:51,937 --> 02:06:53,802
lf he comes to know that we
are entering his house,

1348
02:06:54,273 --> 02:06:59,472
he'll first stab me with that knife.
lt has opened.

1349
02:07:07,519 --> 02:07:10,647
Fix the camera in many places.
l'll wait outside.

1350
02:07:52,297 --> 02:07:55,357
What is it?
- l'm waiting for Manian.

1351
02:07:56,168 --> 02:07:58,534
He must have taken money in advance.
After that he won't have come to that side.

1352
02:07:58,737 --> 02:08:01,137
Correct. So all of you know his nature.

1353
02:08:01,840 --> 02:08:07,710
Useless guy. He'll come fully drunk
and hit his wife and children.

1354
02:08:08,480 --> 02:08:11,779
l'll wait and see him and then only go.
He is bound to come at some time. - Okay.

1355
02:08:34,039 --> 02:08:36,337
ln 5 angles l have set up camera.
- Correct.

1356
02:08:40,446 --> 02:08:45,406
Benoy! Benoy! Evening his
cameras should be switched on.

1357
02:08:45,617 --> 02:08:47,915
Battery back up?
- Will work for 3 hours.

1358
02:08:48,187 --> 02:08:49,745
Tomorrow you must come and collect.

1359
02:08:50,622 --> 02:08:53,216
That you don't bother.
l'll come at mid night and take it.

1360
02:08:53,459 --> 02:08:56,428
All of them can be taken from holes?
- Holes?

1361
02:09:12,745 --> 02:09:14,110
ls this the house?
- Yes.

1362
02:09:18,517 --> 02:09:19,984
Two of you go to the back door.

1363
02:09:20,185 --> 02:09:22,278
lf he tries to run, catch him.
- Sir!

1364
02:09:23,922 --> 02:09:24,889
Call him.

1365
02:09:35,100 --> 02:09:36,795
lsn't Manian there?
- Yes.

1366
02:09:40,506 --> 02:09:42,804
Who is it?.
- Sir!

1367
02:09:43,942 --> 02:09:45,136
Come Manian.

1368
02:09:49,681 --> 02:09:51,478
What is it?
- Come.

1369
02:09:52,251 --> 02:09:55,652
Put him inside the jeep.
- Sir! - Get in.

1370
02:09:55,854 --> 02:09:56,821
Mother!

1371
02:10:02,761 --> 02:10:05,662
Alex! ls the vehicle ready to take him?
- Yes. lt is ready.

1372
02:10:06,198 --> 02:10:09,497
Madam! His mobile phone.
- Take out the sim and give him.

1373
02:10:09,701 --> 02:10:12,499
He won't need it any more.
- Come. - Madam! lO

1374
02:10:13,639 --> 02:10:17,166
Alex! Take him. Else one bullet of my
service revolver will get wasted.

1375
02:10:17,376 --> 02:10:20,504
Madam! lO
- Walk.

1376
02:10:29,354 --> 02:10:31,515
Show The Spirit programme
is going to take place

1377
02:10:31,723 --> 02:10:37,753
without a guest for the first time today.
Only the comparer will be there.

1378
02:10:38,030 --> 02:10:39,861
Only physically there is
no one in that seat.

1379
02:10:40,065 --> 02:10:43,694
There is a person there.
That is this Raghunanthan only.

1380
02:10:44,403 --> 02:10:48,134
You can name this programme
as confession also.

1381
02:10:49,875 --> 02:10:53,868
From last 25 years this me
Raghunanthan consumes alcohol.

1382
02:10:54,079 --> 02:10:58,106
You can say l was like that. l used
to welcome morning with drinks.

1383
02:10:58,317 --> 02:11:04,017
Whole day l used to drink non stop.
Night l had no one to say good night.

1384
02:11:04,223 --> 02:11:07,784
l have heard no one wishing me
to have sweet dreams.

1385
02:11:08,293 --> 02:11:11,228
l used to slip into sleep many times.

1386
02:11:14,499 --> 02:11:20,404
Al last one day with lot of control
l threw away my last glass of whisky.

1387
02:11:21,073 --> 02:11:26,739
ln the slow conscious of sun light
l saw Manian in front of me.

1388
02:11:27,379 --> 02:11:32,578
When l saw him carefully
l saw myself in his reflection.

1389
02:11:33,785 --> 02:11:37,846
l was arrogant that l could
speak 5 foreign languages.

1390
02:11:38,357 --> 02:11:45,092
l used to show off that there is no place
in this globe where l have not traveled.

1391
02:11:45,631 --> 02:11:50,591
l used to think that there is nothing
left which l have not read.

1392
02:11:50,802 --> 02:11:53,862
ln front of me Manian
came as an alien to me.

1393
02:11:54,573 --> 02:11:59,442
Then l recognized that he
is not a stranger to me.

1394
02:12:00,045 --> 02:12:07,110
lt is me. The one l had never seen.
The myself whom l had not known.

1395
02:12:07,653 --> 02:12:11,282
l have never asked Manian
any questions.

1396
02:12:11,690 --> 02:12:14,887
l didn't trap him by asking questions
for which he couldn't answer.

1397
02:12:15,394 --> 02:12:18,625
lnstead of that my young friend
Benoy the camera man

1398
02:12:18,830 --> 02:12:27,829
for my sake went behind Manian.
A day in the life of a chronic alcoholic.

1399
02:12:28,073 --> 02:12:40,349
The govt. is making crores of money
from this most profitable business.

1400
02:12:40,852 --> 02:12:44,811
This govt. treasure is filled by
people like Mani or you.

1401
02:12:45,624 --> 02:12:48,149
Let us see one day in Manian's life.

1402
02:13:05,110 --> 02:13:10,514
Mania! Come here.
- Babu! l'll give it after two days.

1403
02:13:10,716 --> 02:13:13,184
Give it. - Don't touch my pocket.
There is no money.

1404
02:13:13,385 --> 02:13:16,946
After taking money are
you trying to fool me?

1405
02:13:19,458 --> 02:13:20,447
Stop there.

1406
02:13:30,335 --> 02:13:48,778
{ MACHAAN }

1407
02:13:54,259 --> 02:13:58,593
How much time will you take?
Come out.

1408
02:14:07,873 --> 02:14:10,398
lnstead of seeing go and drink
lime water from downstairs.

1409
02:14:10,609 --> 02:14:11,075
Okay.

1410
02:14:20,552 --> 02:14:21,917
For the time being keep this.

1411
02:14:22,120 --> 02:14:24,088
Rest.
- Rest l'll give tomorrow.

1412
02:14:25,624 --> 02:14:26,921
This l'm taking.

1413
02:14:47,612 --> 02:14:50,342
lf you want, you come and eat.
l have had.

1414
02:14:58,390 --> 02:14:59,550
You remain here.

1415
02:15:15,674 --> 02:15:18,302
Come here. Have you seen my children?
- Yes.

1416
02:15:18,510 --> 02:15:20,410
lsn't younger daughter fair like me?

1417
02:15:20,612 --> 02:15:23,638
They have got your glamour.
- That is true.

1418
02:15:23,849 --> 02:15:25,908
The elder one is dark. lsn't it?
- Slightly.

1419
02:15:26,118 --> 02:15:28,814
Not slightly. He is dark.
How did that happen?

1420
02:15:29,020 --> 02:15:34,652
l'm fair and she is also fair.
That boy is not my child. Yes. lt is true.

1421
02:15:35,861 --> 02:15:37,829
ln the 8th month she had delivery.

1422
02:15:38,096 --> 02:15:41,657
That means when she married me
she was pregnant.

1423
02:15:41,867 --> 02:15:44,335
Did you understand?
What are you doing there?

1424
02:15:44,536 --> 02:15:46,629
l'll kill both of them with this.

1425
02:16:05,457 --> 02:16:07,448
You must eat full stomach.

1426
02:16:08,693 --> 02:16:11,184
What are you doing this?
- Mother!

1427
02:16:12,164 --> 02:16:20,299
What is it? - l'll kill you. l'll kill you.
What are you seeing here?

1428
02:16:21,072 --> 02:16:25,702
Why are you feeding him alone?
Can't you hear me?

1429
02:16:25,911 --> 02:16:31,474
Aye, Man! - Your love. l'll kill you.
l'll kill you too.

1430
02:16:31,750 --> 02:16:34,878
Get up.
- Father! Don't do anything.

1431
02:16:35,086 --> 02:16:38,055
Father! Don't hit mother.
- Get lost.

1432
02:16:38,423 --> 02:16:47,058
Father! Don't hit mother.
- l'll kill him. Leave me.

1433
02:16:49,534 --> 02:16:53,231
You are too fond of him.
l'll finish you today.

1434
02:16:55,941 --> 02:16:58,910
l won't keep you alive.

1435
02:17:02,380 --> 02:17:04,507
l saw that boy's father today.

1436
02:17:06,785 --> 02:17:08,753
l'll finish both of you.

1437
02:17:22,200 --> 02:17:32,667
Why are you crying? l'll kill you.
Get out. You want to feed that boy.

1438
02:17:33,545 --> 02:17:40,280
l'll throw away all the food.
lf you act smart, l'll kill you.

1439
02:17:40,485 --> 02:17:53,797
Where is that bastard? Useless boy.
The time to feed him. l'll kill all of you.

1440
02:17:53,999 --> 02:17:56,331
No dog will come to question me.

1441
02:17:59,671 --> 02:18:02,799
We saw a man's life
through secret camera.

1442
02:18:03,008 --> 02:18:07,240
l'm not broadcasting this in front of
so many people and backing out.

1443
02:18:08,246 --> 02:18:11,807
What l did to Manian and
his family is a cheap thing.

1444
02:18:12,017 --> 02:18:17,978
Some might feel like that.
But Manian won't agree with them.

1445
02:18:18,189 --> 02:18:26,654
Reason being now he is out of liquor.
He is standing drenched in sun light.

1446
02:18:26,965 --> 02:18:30,731
Manian! My brother!
Are you seeing this programme?

1447
02:18:38,109 --> 02:18:41,340
l know he is seeing this
with tears in eyes.

1448
02:18:41,546 --> 02:18:44,276
Manian is now in a rehabilitation centre.

1449
02:18:44,482 --> 02:18:48,851
His wife and children are
in the shade of hospitality.

1450
02:18:49,054 --> 02:18:49,850
That too we can see.

1451
02:18:50,055 --> 02:18:53,684
House keeping in charge
is the name of yourjob.

1452
02:18:53,925 --> 02:18:56,689
Meera must have told you
what all you have to do.

1453
02:18:57,128 --> 02:19:00,188
Before the guest arrives
you must clean up the room.

1454
02:19:00,398 --> 02:19:02,025
For that you'll have helpers.

1455
02:19:02,901 --> 02:19:04,596
Next week we'll leave for America.

1456
02:19:04,803 --> 02:19:05,701
Okay, madam!

1457
02:19:05,904 --> 02:19:07,872
No need to call me as madam.
Call me as Meera.

1458
02:19:08,073 --> 02:19:11,201
After today your children
will study in Joy's school.

1459
02:19:11,409 --> 02:19:14,378
lt is a school where rich family
children study.

1460
02:19:14,579 --> 02:19:19,539
They'll study without fees. Raghu sir's friend
Joss Thomas is the chairman of that school.

1461
02:19:19,751 --> 02:19:21,048
He has accepted that.
- Thanks!

1462
02:19:21,519 --> 02:19:24,545
Soon Manian will come to them.

1463
02:19:25,757 --> 02:19:28,225
Manian's past life was an ordinary one.

1464
02:19:28,426 --> 02:19:31,224
Else one among lakhs of stories.
You'll say like that.

1465
02:19:31,429 --> 02:19:35,297
l do agree. But this change is wonderful.

1466
02:19:35,934 --> 02:19:39,335
The angel of savior won't reach all of them.

1467
02:19:39,537 --> 02:19:42,062
Some people in some places are selected.

1468
02:19:42,273 --> 02:19:46,073
To the other prays Show The Spirit
has only one thing to tell.

1469
02:19:46,378 --> 02:19:48,403
You become your own savior.

1470
02:19:50,281 --> 02:19:54,012
From the hold of devil only you can
reach the god by yourself.

1471
02:19:54,219 --> 02:19:59,885
lt is only for you. For those innocent
lives who are under your wings.

1472
02:20:00,225 --> 02:20:03,422
To the love that fills you and
gets spread among others.

1473
02:20:03,628 --> 02:20:04,595
That is the biggest intoxication.

1474
02:20:04,796 --> 02:20:07,765
No one has filled a bigger
intoxication than this in any bottle.

1475
02:20:07,966 --> 02:20:11,265
l'm Raghunanthan signing off from
Show The Spirit.

1476
02:21:14,365 --> 02:21:18,995
Sir! For this one night. Please!

1477
02:21:50,134 --> 02:21:51,192
lt was not needed.

1478
02:22:11,856 --> 02:22:13,551
What did you do this?

1479
02:22:14,859 --> 02:22:17,054
Stupid! - lO
- Useless!

1480
02:22:17,262 --> 02:22:20,060
Sunny! Look here.
Please! There is no problem.

1481
02:22:25,270 --> 02:22:27,465
Next Friday we are leaving for US.

1482
02:22:27,672 --> 02:22:29,503
Sunny has not got his visa.

1483
02:22:30,742 --> 02:22:32,972
lf he is not particular about coming.

1484
02:22:33,211 --> 02:22:35,839
lf he doesn't mind staying with me,
l'll look after him.

1485
02:22:37,415 --> 02:22:40,248
l'll ask him. Come, come.

1486
02:22:51,596 --> 02:22:54,565
Why did you do that?
l don't like drinking

1487
02:23:00,104 --> 02:23:07,442
l took the glass for a courtesy

1488
02:23:08,212 --> 02:23:10,806
l don't like that

1489
02:23:13,751 --> 02:23:19,690
See, l didn't drink, hereafter l won't drink.

1490
02:23:36,908 --> 02:23:39,638
Let us live together for some days.

1491
02:23:51,089 --> 02:24:03,331
''From this glass house let us fly to
the beautiful days on this earth.''

1492
02:24:04,869 --> 02:24:15,677
''From this glass house let us fly to
the beautiful days on this earth.''

1493
02:24:15,880 --> 02:24:26,688
''New words will get formed.
Let us play in the moon light.''

1494
02:24:26,891 --> 02:24:38,359
''From this glass house let us fly to
the beautiful days on this earth.''
