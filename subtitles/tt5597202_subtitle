I am the one you marry
I did not look

125
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:50,630
Did you see him with your eyes?

126
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:53,950
However, there is no difference. My dear

Why ask?

130
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:09,990
Nothing. If you go, you have another option
Lose

131
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:13,830
So?
He'll marry me with him

132
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:19,220
Are you stupid and marry him?
No matter who. If I got married

133
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:23,550
Your will
Do not go there. There is Uncle. Get out of here

134
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:36,330
I understand the problem
No harm. I win. Put

135
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:38,980
What happened, huh? See your brother

136
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:42,200
Daughter is married. She
Playing cards

137
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:46,250
He is. Do not worry
I'll handle everything

138
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:49,790
It's time for Gourry. Is daughter ready?

139
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:52,110
I do not know. Let me see now
Right

140
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,330
Uncle

141
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:11,230

Be careful. All of them are mine

143
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:28,860
Where's your sister?
Mother

144
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:32,210
She ran away from home
What do you say?

145
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:35,420
It's time for Gourry. Why
Let's go soon

146
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:39,320
What else is too late? Big daughter
He left his house and ran away

147
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:42,920
What happened?

148
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:45,310
My plan
is it? Yes

149
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:47,870
Whatever happens if he finds out
Think about it

150
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:52,130
Nothing happens
Who's marrying him if he runs away?

151
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:56,380
why so? They ran away
Who is a girl from a girl's house?

152
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:58,690
So my marriage will never be?

153
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:01,500
This soul will not be
Your brother's heard. Do not scream

154
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:07,340
Uncle. I'll tell you where the sister is

155
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:15,790
I do not like this marriage, Uncle

156
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:21,070
If you had to marry, you should have denied it
If the marriage is over, the brother's fame will be lost

157
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:24,330
Let's go from here before he knows it

158
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:48,360
She got married. Now my path is clear

159
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:04,800
What's this? I've got a new ringtone

160
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,720
We're getting a bridegroom like the gold

161
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:14,260
Everybody thinks so. Just say it
Nobody gives the gold
- Can I get a Sony sono ringtone?

162
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,610
Do not set up the radiator. Setteit Set

163
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:23,240
Would she like me? If I were there
Never like it. Do what I say

164
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:28,840
I have a plan. If my uncle got caught
My daughter will just get caught

165
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:35,920
No one can do anything right
- What are you doing there?

166
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:46,960
What happened?

167
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:51,350
Good chance. Let's tell him a favor.

168
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:56,940
Now, my eldest daughter got married. Within a few years
Let's do it

169
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,000
Tell

170
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:07,030
Okay. After 20 years
Let's marry

171
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:12,620
Daughter's daughter wants a good boy?
How can you do it all of a sudden?

172
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,970
He's got it

173
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:17,210
Our tale searches for a girl for her son

174
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:20,140
We know their work. Good family

175
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,270
How's it all right?
What's wrong uncle?

176
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:27,100
Nothing. Get Satiri to marry
I was talking

177
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,460
Have you come close to the story?

178
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:33,440
Krishna was speaking...
She's a gentleman

179
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,380
Do what he says
Do not praise me so much

180
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:40,940
Satchithi's marriage is with him
How does she know? What's wrong with that?

181
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:44,420
My SIM is new
What do you think?

182
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:46,960
Do not know who you are

183
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:50,070
Your wife is a good suggestion
Find out at one time

184
00:15:56,730 --> 00:15:59,780
All right, let's talk to him

185
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:06,790
What's this?

186
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:32,680
Your marriage is going on
We have to go. LÃ¦hÃ¦stivenna

187
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:36,490
It will be fun

188
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:48,570
The grandmother said you were kidding

189
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:54,110
For a suggestion? Now the village changes
Then the environment changes

190
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,670
You will get a different day

191
00:16:58,390 --> 00:17:00,940
You're not willing to get married this time

192
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,980
Grandmother's consent
He'll be the way he wants

193
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:13,950
How will she be?

194
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:20,090
What's this?

195
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:23,060
If you ever say anything to Mom, you'll be done

196
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:25,820
If she asks what you did, she will kill you

197
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:29,380
Do not talk too much Uncle
Do not stop. Read more

198
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:33,180
What's up, brother? If she loves going to party
Why did you go away?

199
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:39,570
You have to get away from your son
So I made a 10-day trip. It's come to say it

200
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:43,300
Do not try to come along with me

201
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:48,160
Do a job. That you and I have no connection
Take a seat on your neck and walk

202
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:51,610
For the first time in life, we gave a good idea
Thanks

203
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:53,600
Here's the catch
Keep going

204
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,590
Come on

205
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,660
Everything is ready, right? Yes

206
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:10,420
Is it Mike or not? Yes

207
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:15,610
I will accept everyone from Sidhi

208
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:19,470
This is a 2-day trip. This is your destination
Happy

209
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:22,220
Rangan Ganga Band creates

210
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:29,720
The opportunity to sing on the train

211
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:33,710
With difficulty we have teamed up

212
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:36,550
Why are you reading so much? Tell the numbers
We'll go sit down

213
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:38,240
Get his kettle on his dishes

214
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,140
Exactly. Another important thing

215
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:44,670
The person in our picture and our governing body
No connection

216
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:48,720
He has more heart disease and high blood pressure
Our announcement is to stay away

217
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,750
Friendly Travels think of your happiness
- Is the car in the picture in the car?

218
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:55,700
He'll get up and get a ride on the car
We do not have a relationship. remember

219
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:59,300
This nonsense does not stop
Get in the car

220
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,360
We'll get up

221
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:04,360
Right

222
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:07,800
If he's in trouble, why is he with him?

223
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:11,120
It's a man who smoked cigarette for 10 days
Can not stop

224
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:16,550
I see him from 10 months
How can I quit?

225
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:20,060
Do not bother
Lift it up

226
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:22,970
Harmony 9th bullet
You're up

227
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:25,470
Women?
He'll be with our sir

228
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:29,950
He's standing on the street
Where were I the road?

229
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:31,360
Stop. I'm talking

230
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,600
I can not take such heavy weight
Is not it enough of goods? How to get it?

231
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:37,470
Get lost. Where is Saatchi?

232
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:02,540
Spitty left the vehicle
Come on

233
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:05,860
Trains off the train

234
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:42,880
It's not the ghosts but Altar
Did not you tell him?

235
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:47,130
If there were any. Before I was dying, I lost it
What?

236
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:50,100
Before it came out
I got it

237
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,650
The problem started

238
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:57,120
You were running. I fell down
Where should I go?

239
00:22:57,870 --> 00:23:02,360
Why goes S.2? Come with me
There the bull is empty

240
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:06,730
Looking for a nice passenger
Can you make a separation?

241
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:12,030
He saved the train from ruining. Thank you
Thanks

242
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:29,500
My brain is upset. Where's the baby?

243
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,020
Baby came in
The question too came up

244
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:41,030
Uncle. Are you on this train?
Have you seen it?

245
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:48,440
Very happy
- You came? I'm so excited. Go

246
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:55,070
What did you do?
What happened?

247
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:58,090
A wedding song in Trivia came
After this, did you come here?

248
00:23:58,090 --> 00:24:01,440
Is our coupled pair right? If he finds out
Slippers will spoil each pair

249
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,510
Do not say anything louder anyway

250
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:05,800
I'm already done
Soon be quiet

251
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,840
Can this be the sister of Akitha?

252
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:11,440
I can be his assistant
Think

253
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,950
I'm not sure. Let's face you

254
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:18,240
People look at the wrong angle
I do not do anything else

255
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:21,120
Do you know what they're saying?
Raff

256
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:22,660
Do you taste?

257
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:27,970
Look at the Nakciaki trunk

258
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:31,330
He'll come after you from a dog

259
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:46,480
Pay attention to him. About me
Why direct?

260
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:51,760
Stay

261
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:59,730
Is he coming? Coming

262
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,430
Is not it embarrassing? A girl is working
You are waiting

263
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:09,700
It did a good job. Eat always
No work is done

264
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,290
You only had a chance, right?

265
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:20,190
There's nothing to show her picture
No, he said. But he slipped

266
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:24,930
Listen. Everyone smokes cigarettes
But the government banned the cigarette?

267
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:28,570
That's how it happens

268
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:32,790
He's drinking the cigarette on the train
What?

269
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:37,400
He advised me
They're smoking cigarettes

270
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:42,500
The band of gangs and rivers for you
Greetings

271
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:48,320
We were given an opportunity to sing this beautiful song
Friendly Travels owner

272
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,950
We're thanking you

273
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:55,400
Why cheering on this?

274
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,870
Now look. They'll shake these

275
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:02,270
Ram Jerry Gangama film
God is a worshiper of God

276
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:06,720
So he chanted for the god of Baba
That's singing

277
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:10,290
Now he understands my student
Feeling

278
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:17,560
That's what Sibaaba asks

279
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,630
The meaning of that

280
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:23,690
Come to your palace for your divine glory
- That's a good story

281
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:33,970
I touched you. Touch me too
The meaning of that

282
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:38,580
As we would to welcome you
Accept us

283
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:41,730
This is the meaning of this song

284
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:44,510
Make fools
kick off

285
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:54,670
When singing a song, I sing Hindi songs
They took a lot of money

286
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:16,000
What do you guys say about this?
Sit down, sit down

287
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,250
Why are you going there? Can not clap your hands?

288
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:03,060
If anyone saw anyone seeing you as a martyr

289
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:06,760
know. Everything knows
To say something? Tell

290
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:10,680
Understand your love
Or I will know another way

291
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:14,180
I feel flowers faint when I talk
- He will not be formed

292
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:20,890
What happened?

293
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:25,050
I'm coming silly
There will be a kiss today. It will cough

294
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:29,890
Then, dengue is followed by malaria
Grandma's going to kill me. Three people can not come

295
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:33,640
Do not play too much
You do not understand

296
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:37,390
Listen to me. This is a doctor in train
There?

297
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:39,810
Where is the veterinarian in this train?
Bring you?

298
00:28:39,810 --> 00:28:42,940
Listen to me. The doctor is not for me, drummer

299
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:47,310
There's a doctor here for a moment
Go ahead and head to the left

300
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:55,980
Who is the patient?

301
00:28:56,690 --> 00:29:00,280
My baby's a sick person
Open up the innocent syringe. Do something

302
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,760
Do you and drinks? Baby

303
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:08,020
Why do you think so? You're a doctor
I can not believe it

304
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:09,970
Have confidence

305
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:13,980
Doctor got it
Right

306
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:16,540
Is he a doctor?

307
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:20,660
These people are wrong
I do not know to do any other work

308
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:22,540
Do you know what they're saying?
Broker

309
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:26,310
What's your name?
Do not say

310
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:30,950
Says. Do you have the doctor name?

311
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:35,270
Where is the village? Where is the village?

312
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:39,370
There's a cholera in our village. Basu's village
There are dengue. You need to know what's in your village

313
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:44,810
After the attack, I tried to hit
Now I'm going to touch my hand

314
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:01,310
Take a deep breath

315
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,560
Leave

316
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:06,720
Get back

317
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:08,600
Leave

318
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:18,240
This is not a treatment. Like yoga
it seems

319
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,300
Close your mouth. Let him do his job

320
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:25,600
No problem. The weather changed
Sneak peek. The pills are good

321
00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:30,950
Now I do not feel hungry right now
What's up?

322
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:34,490
Now, a kilo of Apple was eating. how are you
Saying to be hungry? Stop the nonsense

323
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:03,800
Where's Grandma? Sleeping in sleeping pills upstairs

324
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,490
Give me a place to sit down madam

325
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:15,100
Baby, you did not have to take this kick

326
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:18,370
A daughter of my poor boss

327
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:22,300
KÄá¹civaramda? not. DharmÄpuram

328
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:23,870
Are you married?

329
00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:27,400
I would be late for a few more minutes
There was going to be someone else

330
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:29,320
So he ran away with you?

331
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,800
The thieves are coming up
He's taking his boyfriend

332
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:34,550
So, did he love a thief?
Who is speaking like this?

333
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:36,710
A brain obscurant

334
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:41,710
Complain? Wait a minute
We do not talk with people weird

335
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:44,580
Will you have a cigarette?
Come on

336
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:49,420
Stay away from him. I'll be right back
Did you see what he saw and love?

337
00:31:57,590 --> 00:31:59,910
His thoughts did not seem like this

338
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:04,400
This is why the girlfriend came to you
As low as you think?

339
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:09,050
Think of it. You alone or not
Do you have a sister?

340
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:12,380
There's a sister. But he supports me

341
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:15,600
That helped me escape
Destroyed

342
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:20,350
He did not even think of a single one. You ran away
How is that Ascianian mum?

343
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:22,160
If you've been thinking, nothing happens

344
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:26,010
Everything has to be done if love is made

345
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:30,540
It's not too late. Jump away

346
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,470

00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:39,770
If I get killed, I will be killed. I'm looking for me

349
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:43,870
I'm in a lot of excitement
Where's the toilet?

350
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,570
That way

351
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,760
Your daughter is in the Sdi train on the Sedi train

352
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:59,020
At night, the train at Kamaraddy stops
Send your men

353
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:02,290
You did a good job

354
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:17,730
A short train from Visakhapatnam
It's scheduled to leave

355
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:22,080
Sit in your seats

00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:27,090
The Sainiger Shedi Expo has
stopped the stage number 1

357
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:33,360
Here we are

358
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:54,180
Where did you go?
Who are they harming?

359
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:56,450
Is this his people or not?

360
00:33:57,030 --> 00:34:00,500
Where's the girl?
Look around

361
00:34:00,810 --> 00:34:01,920
Not here

362
00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:08,300
They're running

363
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:17,500
Where are you going?

364
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:34,860
Let me tell you
Thank you later. Now go

365
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,480
Where are you going? come here

366
00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:02,510
Do not look at my face and capture them

367
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:12,590
It's over

368
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,120
They went for a train

369
00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:18,710
What will I do now?

370
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:24,540
Why are you looking at me this way?
Look at it

371
00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:26,670
Great, right? Yes

372
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:31,750
God save me

373
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:36,250
Where are you going? Come in and sit down

374
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:40,750
Did you come back for me?
Come quickly

375
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:53,860
They do not sing these Bhakti songs
Singing songs Get up, baby

376
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:57,770
Where's the baby?

377
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:01,010
Grandma is there

378
00:36:11,050 --> 00:36:14,800
Have we seen our babies? Leave the baby
Listen to Baba's song

00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,680
Beat

380
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:28,440
Got it. She has done something

381
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:34,850
who is? You do not have a baby

382
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:39,660
Why are you touching your head? Where's the baby?
You do not see your nephew

383
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:43,590
Not even those two lovers

384
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:46,060
Wake up the Sahtith
The grandmother's sleep was broken

385
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:47,850
Do not give up the shock
I will die

386
00:36:47,850 --> 00:36:50,100
If you do not, I have not got a baby either
Kill you

387
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:54,100
Bring to Saitrigi

388
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:58,710
Now she's crying. By the time, gentlemen
Speaks. What will I do now?

389
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:01,520
You need to call, right?
Yes

390
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,840
Call me. Put the spikers

391
00:37:06,370 --> 00:37:08,740
This other girl. To your lover
KatÄkalÄda?

392
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:11,720
Customer Service
Is he a Don?

393
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:16,140
He's not in a location where the signal is
Do not know Signal

394
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:21,650
Do not disturb me
They keep calling. Got it?

395
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:25,820
Who are you talking to? Shall I shoot Shakhtar?
All the work is left

396
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:30,560
Everything's fine

397
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:34,500
who is this?
Why did you stop singing?

398
00:37:35,010 --> 00:37:37,570
What did you say? Ganga's song

399
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:40,430
Come on, come on
Need rivers?

400
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:47,460
Nice. Started

401
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:50,020
Where's Rizi going?

402
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,060
What's wrong with this place?

403
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:16,620
This is because the car's design has changed

404
00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:21,200
Who are you guys? Where did you get me?

405
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:27,220
There are women inside. This is family
Business? Who is he? Like a thief

406
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:31,230
Actually this is what happened
Leave them off

407
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:34,870
Let me tell you what's going to happen now. for this
You know how many years you've been in prison?

408
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:48,830
We do not count the prison guards. Second
Count in a minute

409
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,890
Yes, I was told

410
00:38:53,890 --> 00:38:57,620
So far, there was no sleep

411
00:38:58,690 --> 00:39:01,050
I found you
Why did you look for me?

412
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:02,220
Not now

413
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:06,910
As much as you're in love with me
Romeo did not want to talk so much about Juliet

414
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:10,790
Why love so much? Tell

415
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:13,720
In the second era

416
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:18,300
You told me to fight

417
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:31,580
Do not you understand now?
How to understand this

418
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:36,990
You are God of action
Am I Krishna Arjun?

419
00:39:37,490 --> 00:39:40,200
Finally you recognized me

420
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:46,880
You're Krishna, you're saying
Tell Arjun, what evidence is this?

421
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:50,230
The carrot in this car

422
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:52,320
What song goes off?
Bhagavad-gita

423
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,470
Who are you in this car?
The driver

424
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:56,980
This is what you mean

425
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:15,110
First I did not believe what you said
But I...

426
00:40:15,110 --> 00:40:17,650
When I looked inside, I was shown Krishna

427
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:22,750
I'm Krishna right. You're Arjun right
Who are these girls? Who is the thief?

428
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:27,150
This Subadra.
My sister

429
00:40:27,830 --> 00:40:30,650
This is Shashiroka
my daughter

430
00:40:30,650 --> 00:40:32,660
This is Abigail

431
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:34,290
Is this the fake face?

432
00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:38,200
Who is Shashirik?
Wait a minute

433
00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:43,330
Tell Arjun what to do now

434
00:40:43,330 --> 00:40:46,350
Do not you know? Shashiroka's marriage

435
00:40:46,350 --> 00:40:48,400
Why Come on

436
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:54,800
It's my seat. I'm Krishna.
The fool really got into the role

437
00:40:57,870 --> 00:41:01,490
Krishna is the one on the blue box, right?

438
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,880
what is doing?

439
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:18,800
do not be afraid. I'm in the car of the car

440
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:23,320
Listen, Arjun. Are you saying the truth?

441
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:26,640
Is there any doubt?
That's what I did, Psy

442
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:29,270
Why do not I remember the Giant Psyche?

443
00:41:29,270 --> 00:41:33,040
First you remember Krishna
Remembers the gritty song

444
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,720
the truth

445
00:41:37,210 --> 00:41:39,540
What is your brother doing?
who is?

446
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:42,820
Playing Dharmara

447
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:44,430
These days, he's not talking to me

448
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:50,090
What did you say? He loved your brother like you
Did you forget your brother?

449
00:41:55,090 --> 00:41:57,900
Someone is tracking our car
who is?

450
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:09,100
These are the wicked.
They're trying to get our life. Let's stop the car

451
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:11,710
They're not talking. Shashriyaka is abducted

452
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:25,920
I am afraid
Do not worry

453
00:42:26,770 --> 00:42:28,590
Who sent you?

454
00:42:31,290 --> 00:42:33,620
First you have to hit the guy who sent them

455
00:42:47,510 --> 00:42:53,230
It's not his brain. He's racing. my
The car is going to come forward. I can not drive this way

456
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:59,580
Stay

457
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:02,790
Do something sweet

458
00:43:02,790 --> 00:43:05,640
He transferred me here. In my seat
He sat down

459
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:08,130
I'm mad because I'm not doing anything

460
00:43:08,130 --> 00:43:14,100
Get out of anger right now and do something
Nothing happens to Krishna God

461
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:18,180
Sing to me

462
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:26,430
Seat the seat belt

463
00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:34,040
Great idea

464
00:43:40,070 --> 00:43:42,330
What's wrong with you? Sir calls me

465
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:45,550
The vehicle could not be missed. Until tomorrow
Not coming

466
00:43:53,850 --> 00:43:56,590
Simply say that they sing well
That

467
00:44:22,550 --> 00:44:26,100
What's this? Those who eat you are mosquitoes

468
00:44:26,310 --> 00:44:29,960
Let's see what happened to your father

469
00:44:35,450 --> 00:44:38,670
What are you looking at? My sister told me in advance

470
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:42,690
That you will get a boy like yourself
Do you watch your sister, Kundle?

471
00:44:42,690 --> 00:44:47,690
No. Give preaching
Grandma always says

472
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:52,810
Do not ever get in touch with others
I called them without asking

473
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:56,570
I know
Do they even know this?

474
00:44:56,570 --> 00:44:57,700
They did not tell them

475
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:03,820
You are a good person. For my marriage
I'll invite you

476
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:05,930
Marriage is someone else who is a good man
To whom?

477
00:45:05,930 --> 00:45:10,220
They did not ask you for help
Why he helped

478
00:45:11,230 --> 00:45:14,690
You do not have to ask for help. The need
We need to be seen

479
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:19,000
Actually, no one really wants help

480
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:23,830
It's a big one. What's your job?

481
00:45:23,830 --> 00:45:25,730
Just touring the train?

482
00:45:29,570 --> 00:45:34,920
I would love to go round the world. So walk
I love life

483
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:39,910
So I learned medicine
I'm not looking for reasons to laugh

484
00:45:40,350 --> 00:45:43,670
I do not think about tomorrow. Because I know

485
00:45:44,090 --> 00:45:47,260
What's going to happen tomorrow

486
00:49:46,670 --> 00:49:48,850
What a hotel? What service?
What happened?

487
00:49:48,850 --> 00:49:51,640
Toss it
Raise his bill

488
00:49:52,650 --> 00:49:57,650
Who's this morning sitting this way?
Raise his bill. Raise

489
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,210
What do you want?

490
00:50:02,410 --> 00:50:04,480
He does not want to say anything like this

491
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:07,140
What nonsense do you read? Give me one

492
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:09,850
He's called to raise his hand. In his bill
Increase 500

493
00:50:10,770 --> 00:50:13,430
Listen to me. Why should this 500-dollar fine?

494
00:50:13,430 --> 00:50:15,770
If my prize hurts
Fine

495
00:50:15,770 --> 00:50:18,090
The Honorary, what are you going to eat here?

496
00:50:20,810 --> 00:50:24,080
Tell me about it. These things have to pay for the bill to me

497
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:27,600
Itali 200, 300 pars
Tossas are 500 new ones

498
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:31,910
Listen, you're giving the toss?
Why is this big tax?

499
00:50:31,910 --> 00:50:36,910
Do you understand him? Married
He was taken from the tabernacle and brought here

500
00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:41,720
If you're out of here, the thieves will come. They're all the tables
Break. Who's paying them?

501
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:44,540
I do not like this place for both of my faces
Get out of here

502
00:50:46,670 --> 00:50:49,930
The thugs come and see where you've gone
Would you tell me?

503
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:53,030
Then sit down

504
00:50:53,450 --> 00:50:56,070
She rose and sat again. In his bill
Increase 50

505
00:50:56,700 --> 00:50:59,930
What do you want?
chicken
Want chicken on your face?

506
00:51:42,340 --> 00:51:47,690
As I know, I am God of glory
That's why they say things

507
00:51:47,860 --> 00:51:49,570
Then have a good time

508
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:55,110
Tell us a way. It's his father's thieves
If you come back?

509
00:51:55,110 --> 00:51:58,140
Did you get permission from her when she was in love?
Now they are asking for solutions

510
00:51:58,140 --> 00:52:01,140
Do I have an idea on the train?

511
00:52:01,140 --> 00:52:03,780
I'm so devastated by my grandmother
Do you know?

512
00:52:03,780 --> 00:52:07,370
You do not come by the train by yourself
I'm down

513
00:52:07,370 --> 00:52:12,630
do not be sad. After their wedding
I'll be happy

514
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:14,810
where is?

515
00:52:18,580 --> 00:52:19,890
Here's chicken

516
00:52:21,950 --> 00:52:24,300
Tell him who's who he is

517
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:26,960
Is he Arjun? Then you are the gods
It must be

518
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:28,390
You do not have to talk to me like that

519
00:52:28,390 --> 00:52:31,990
He does not speak right. Increase 5,000

520
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:34,980
We have to go right now. Is there a car?

521
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:37,910
10,000 will be paid. 5000 without a cabbage
Tell me what kind of vehicles you want

522
00:52:37,910 --> 00:52:40,990
Do you have a low-rise house here?
Put 2000 dollars in his bill

523
00:52:41,310 --> 00:52:44,270
2000 for what? Because the mansion is at a distance

524
00:52:54,950 --> 00:52:59,230
I'll take care of them. The car is repaired
what are you doing?

525
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:04,720
Do not worry about me. I'll take care of them
I'll take care of the repair

526
00:53:14,450 --> 00:53:18,610
Come on. This is our mansion. Known
People come to this from a distance

527
00:53:18,610 --> 00:53:21,190
This is the mansion? Not much

528
00:53:21,620 --> 00:53:23,020
Then 3000 will be reduced

529
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:27,830
Wait. Honor your conduct
They do not give up a kovv either

530
00:53:27,830 --> 00:53:29,850
Come on
Why is she this way?

531
00:53:29,850 --> 00:53:33,390
Listen, fine master
Are there any new clothes out here?

532
00:53:33,790 --> 00:53:36,320
What did you say? New clothes

533
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:40,310
Are your faces new clothes? Second
You can wear clothes. Go and go

534
00:53:40,310 --> 00:53:46,710
Let's go. At the end of the marriage, I will take care of it
You too. I'll give the money

535
00:53:53,410 --> 00:53:54,380
Find them

536
00:54:05,740 --> 00:54:07,820
They're here

537
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:29,920
Take this. I'll be right back

538
00:54:33,150 --> 00:54:35,770
Look at that. It's like a big gang
So, I'll make a big bill

539
00:54:35,770 --> 00:54:39,010
Get them inside
Who's paying my bill? Tell me to get away

540
00:54:40,060 --> 00:54:41,830
Got it. Come on

541
00:54:45,330 --> 00:54:46,530
Go and drag her

542
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:58,380
What kind of a conversation do you have? Uncle for you
There are chicken mutuks to eat

543
00:54:58,750 --> 00:55:03,900
You're here.
I will stop you. They're getting married

544
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:08,310
Now to speak? Show me work?

545
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:10,520
It needs work

546
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:14,990
God is the birthday god of them
There's to be a program

547
00:55:14,990 --> 00:55:17,040
Let's hear a song about her birth

548
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:22,490
After hearing the song, it will be frenzied
Fighting is fun

549
00:55:22,490 --> 00:55:23,970
Increase your musings

550
00:55:56,860 --> 00:55:59,330
Let's go

551
00:55:59,330 --> 00:56:03,920
Sit
Start soon

552
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:06,140
She's sitting here

553
00:56:07,850 --> 00:56:11,940
I sat down. Move

554
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:28,120
Saved them. But some more are coming

555
00:57:34,060 --> 00:57:37,720
What? Are you here?

556
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:41,670
Made it easy. How are these guys?
Work teaching? Shut up

557
00:58:17,010 --> 00:58:21,680
You thought I would not come back? Come on

558
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:24,230
Sit down soon

559
00:58:32,770 --> 00:58:36,830
Get out of here. Take care

560
00:58:51,580 --> 00:58:53,040
She's making a cut
Call again

561
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:58,340
He's gonna suggest me now

562
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:02,880
Say. clean up
I know what you're going to say

563
00:59:04,670 --> 00:59:08,540
If things are out of this,
Thinking of getting married, do not you think?

564
00:59:08,540 --> 00:59:11,380
It's not like that. I know everything

565
00:59:13,650 --> 00:59:15,690
It's different. We are different

566
00:59:16,010 --> 00:59:19,510
You may have changed. I'm not different

567
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:24,200
Is it the family who wants to get married?

568
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:28,480
Or who does not know who gets married
It's not right

569
00:59:30,810 --> 00:59:35,410
I'm not talking about them
You're talking. what are you doing?

570
00:59:35,410 --> 00:59:39,030
Do not follow me. My marriage before
The verdict is over

571
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:50,440
Cut
Call me another time

572
00:59:51,510 --> 00:59:56,160
Unless you say, your life will be mournful.
You have to answer. What do you see me?

573
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:59,000
You're good. But there is nothing more than a friend

574
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:04,520
Two minutes drive. Tell me if you like
Grandma will bind the toads in front

575
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:09,330
You can do the same. This is the pavement
He does not want to marry the temple

576
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,850
I cut again
Call again

577
01:00:16,300 --> 01:00:20,590
I'll call your family home
Right? Do not break my marriage

578
01:00:29,530 --> 01:00:32,620
The train came. The last time I ask

579
01:00:32,620 --> 01:00:34,550
My last answer is the same

580
01:00:37,370 --> 01:00:39,030
What's the problem? There is a line

581
01:00:39,030 --> 01:00:44,070
I'm uncle. Running in two days
The negotiation has to be decided

582
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:46,850
I'd like to come with Mom

583
01:00:46,850 --> 01:00:53,040
I'm 3 meters away from a girl
I met him three days ago. I love her

584
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:58,120
I got it open to everyone
You're wasting time

585
01:00:58,180 --> 01:01:02,020
Find someone else for your daughter
Talk to my mother

586
01:01:02,020 --> 01:01:06,590
Try this Pissy trying to convince me
Do not call me

587
01:01:17,410 --> 01:01:18,550
What did he say?

588
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:28,460
He does not like this marriage
He says he loves someone else

589
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:44,460
Sinhala subtitles are downloaded from www.zoom.lk.

590
01:01:50,730 --> 01:01:55,590
I always thought you were hitting me
You're caught up this time this time. I'm glad

591
01:01:56,970 --> 01:01:58,720
This picture would have been shown earlier

592
01:01:59,370 --> 01:02:04,180
Do you have a joke? First we are forced
I could have talked

593
01:02:04,180 --> 01:02:08,800
The connection broke
Now let's talk. Make you want

594
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:12,430
She can not do anything
You have to break him before

595
01:02:12,430 --> 01:02:15,140
Well, I was told
Do not joke

596
01:02:15,910 --> 01:02:18,000
If we endure for 4 days, we may have been married

597
01:02:18,940 --> 01:02:21,960
He's sure he loves me

598
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:25,570
This time I also thought of myself

599
01:02:25,570 --> 01:02:29,250
To him...
If I contacted the person who broke the connection

600
01:02:29,250 --> 01:02:33,820
Kill him. How I dreamed?
Everything is ruined

601
01:02:33,820 --> 01:02:36,090
Why is this for my own?

602
01:02:36,290 --> 01:02:39,610
Why are you grieving? Do not worry
Angry

603
01:02:39,610 --> 01:02:41,860
Poor whatever your energy is wasted

604
01:02:41,860 --> 01:02:45,010
If only we grieve or they too
Dukvenavada?

605
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:51,260
If there were one, they would receive one hundred
Find somebody else. It does not sit down

606
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:54,030
If everything was genuine, it would be arranging today

607
01:02:55,410 --> 01:02:57,330
But today the situation is different

608
01:02:58,430 --> 01:03:01,410
Without her fault, it's in there
I'm seated

609
01:03:01,410 --> 01:03:03,650
I feel guilty

610
01:03:03,650 --> 01:03:07,570
What's wrong with you This is me
The motion was brought to you

611
01:03:08,130 --> 01:03:11,960
Rama Lakshman do the love of God
Think ahead

612
01:03:17,300 --> 01:03:22,300
Why do you get so excited? What happened?
The relationship is broken only

613
01:03:23,150 --> 01:03:26,570
The haggams did not break. Savithri's Rajkumar
You must be someone else

614
01:03:27,910 --> 01:03:32,560
This time we are in front
We have not seen him

615
01:03:37,090 --> 01:03:41,750
Yes. He told me something
You can make a resolution in America

616
01:03:41,750 --> 01:03:47,210
She is also a good cultural girl like Sawithethi
Looking. Priyethe suits them

617
01:03:47,210 --> 01:03:50,790
At the same time, I made a mistake. Another time
I do not want to do it

618
01:03:50,790 --> 01:03:53,830
That's right
Nothing like that. I know them well

619
01:03:55,330 --> 01:04:01,060
What's wrong with this? A good suggestion
Why is not this looking at a tip again?

620
01:04:06,170 --> 01:04:07,950
Ask her about this

621
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:20,950
It's a good thing, right? To say something?
What's happening in the future

622
01:04:22,130 --> 01:04:26,180
Tell him you do not want to hear his stories

623
01:04:26,770 --> 01:04:28,500
You're looking at a tip again

624
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:34,640
Another suggestion

625
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:37,790
In America

626
01:04:37,790 --> 01:04:39,930
Tell me more

627
01:04:39,930 --> 01:04:43,020
You will fly away quickly

628
01:04:43,260 --> 01:04:47,200
The first time the bus came
This is an airbus

629
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:50,670
Fly. How many flying
I'll see

630
01:05:05,780 --> 01:05:10,640
For me, this pissy me understands
Do not call me

631
01:05:22,660 --> 01:05:25,020
A dream come true like that

632
01:05:25,020 --> 01:05:27,470
Leave that dream. Rishi is sitting outside

633
01:05:27,470 --> 01:05:30,720
Why is he here?
Let's go

634
01:05:38,230 --> 01:05:40,390
I had a small mistake

635
01:05:41,470 --> 01:05:45,180
I have to go angry with the mistake I made
But it's possible to forget

636
01:05:46,040 --> 01:05:48,650
I have two things to talk to you

637
01:05:48,650 --> 01:05:55,360
The first one. I said I'd love a girlfriend, right?
He's not anybody else. Your daughter

638
01:05:59,950 --> 01:06:05,130
My daughter will come up with your proposal
It's good for you

639
01:06:05,330 --> 01:06:09,620
Doctor. I thought it was good

640
01:06:10,460 --> 01:06:15,040
I was pleased with the suggestion you knew
But after talking to you, you did not like it

641
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:20,330
A girl's house does not like your daughter
It's a brave story

642
01:06:20,550 --> 01:06:25,280
How to call the visitors to my home
I know

643
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:28,990
I do not care if I did not show solidarity
But culture does not work

644
01:06:28,990 --> 01:06:32,800
You're angry with me
My love is true too

645
01:06:33,560 --> 01:06:36,360
I'm sure about you
You'll forgive me

646
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:39,390
That girl is 3 meters away
Not my daughter

647
01:06:40,270 --> 01:06:42,310
You're not coming here

648
01:06:43,310 --> 01:06:47,020
I'm sure you got the answer
You can go

649
01:06:47,020 --> 01:06:53,320
Second, You're taking care of our paddy fields?
Give it to us again

650
01:06:53,730 --> 01:06:56,510
This is not your home, your elders
I'm doing it with

651
01:06:56,510 --> 01:06:58,380
This is why I came from my uncle

652
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:04,820
I'm trying to tell them if they've given us back
Krishna

653
01:07:05,740 --> 01:07:09,130
He is not wrong. But the time you requested
It's a bit wrong

654
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:13,050
Show it to him

655
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:15,770
What do you say?
Talk about the paddy field

656
01:07:15,770 --> 01:07:18,220
I'm marrying you and asking for a field

657
01:07:24,420 --> 01:07:30,440
I know. You did not come from the paddy fields
Seeing you can see what your purpose is

658
01:07:33,130 --> 01:07:35,360
SautÐ¿ÑÐ¸Ñi looked at another suggestion

659
01:07:35,910 --> 01:07:39,890
Saatchi is in our village
Brother's fame

660
01:07:40,770 --> 01:07:47,620
I'm doing anything to save it

661
01:07:51,120 --> 01:07:55,000
Do not get so upset
Quickly aging

662
01:07:55,600 --> 01:07:59,850
My decision is not your middle ground
Will

663
01:08:00,130 --> 01:08:01,580
This way

664
01:08:06,070 --> 01:08:10,070
The field work is done in one month
Your field will be returned

665
01:08:10,560 --> 01:08:14,710
Do not come here anyway or not

666
01:08:16,370 --> 01:08:20,010
I studied well.
We accept weakness

667
01:08:21,270 --> 01:08:25,480
The story's over
Take the sack

668
01:08:31,810 --> 01:08:36,210
What is this field? What's your marriage?
What's that girl?

669
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:37,460
Here it is

670
01:08:38,860 --> 01:08:42,470
Have you seen the field?
Did you think I came to see you?

671
01:08:42,470 --> 01:08:47,810
If the field is you, the field is dowry
Will. Get the field first. Then he'll take you

672
01:08:47,810 --> 01:08:53,970
Do not worry about me. I'm New York
Or Paris

673
01:08:54,540 --> 01:08:57,560
Then rattle the burk in Africa
It's no big deal

674
01:08:57,560 --> 01:09:03,350
KatÄkarapuden. Because of the denial, there is suffering
If you read too much, you will not be able to tolerate it

675
01:09:05,790 --> 01:09:07,340
What are you doing?
Somebody sees

676
01:09:08,190 --> 01:09:11,570
I can not stop if I see so much

677
01:09:11,570 --> 01:09:14,150
Get away from me

678
01:09:15,420 --> 01:09:16,150
Get out of here

679
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:23,170
Nice. Come on, Uncle
where is?

680
01:09:23,170 --> 01:09:26,070
There is little work
What else is left?

681
01:09:31,350 --> 01:09:36,350
Even Venus does not go above the head

682
01:09:36,770 --> 01:09:39,850
Who is stopping his job?

683
01:09:57,700 --> 01:09:58,840
Where did he come from?

684
01:10:15,680 --> 01:10:17,210
It's like taking a sacrifice inside

685
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:35,190
Listen

686
01:10:37,270 --> 01:10:38,960
Who is Rau here?

687
01:11:06,380 --> 01:11:12,830
There are no women at home. There are lanterns
There is Kolam. Commit. Foolishness?

688
01:11:13,780 --> 01:11:17,160
What's going on here? The right to ask
Only we have

689
01:11:17,160 --> 01:11:22,760
You attacked your people two days ago
They said they had a boyfriend with that girl

690
01:11:23,670 --> 01:11:24,620
it's me

691
01:11:25,460 --> 01:11:31,390
On June 8, Sahtith left here
He was not alone. There were 7-8 people with him

692
01:11:37,880 --> 01:11:40,330
When there were 10 people on the street

693
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:58,050
When I went to Dabar, it was 20
When I went to the mansion, it was 50

694
01:12:02,030 --> 01:12:06,160
Listen. Tracking the train
Pushed by car and forgiven

695
01:12:06,160 --> 01:12:11,320
But when you get to the mansion
Did not give him up

696
01:12:15,690 --> 01:12:19,010
Why Do They Come In?
You're in a wrong mood

697
01:12:20,060 --> 01:12:27,250
This is not a story today
20 years old story. You have jumped into the middle

698
01:12:31,620 --> 01:12:35,230
Because she got nuts, she was taken with the girl
You did not want to run away?

699
01:12:35,510 --> 01:12:40,060
If this thought comes again, it will be very sad

700
01:12:41,860 --> 01:12:47,620
Not only did we receive defeat but many victories
Saitheit was born with Kundali

701
01:12:47,970 --> 01:12:51,840
Sahty, look at Bapu's look
He had

702
01:12:55,930 --> 01:13:01,330
Bapu decided
Sayithithi feels like opling

703
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:05,630
Give me my kite

704
01:13:07,950 --> 01:13:08,990
This is your uncle

705
01:13:14,150 --> 01:13:20,200
Very beautiful. See the youth

706
01:13:22,750 --> 01:13:27,400
Now you tell me. SÄvitriva
Is she shopping rich?

707
01:13:27,400 --> 01:13:31,810
It's not wrong. It's got to marry
We came in the wrong. Let's go

708
01:13:32,590 --> 01:13:35,250
You're silent. I'll take care

709
01:13:36,020 --> 01:13:39,430
These are crazy. This time I'm here
What do you want to do?

710
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:46,170
Not married for 20 years
This is what happens

711
01:13:46,570 --> 01:13:51,980
Tell him to be cowardly
In medicine, this is called a mental disorder

712
01:13:52,410 --> 01:13:56,520
You are from the same village. If he was kidnapped
Is money remaining?

713
01:13:56,520 --> 01:14:00,610
So expensive for all this work?
Uncle's idea

714
01:14:01,430 --> 01:14:06,970
If you come in from Usseni village you will be suspicious
If UzSen comes out of the village, he will be fortunate

715
01:14:07,450 --> 01:14:11,430
So it's planned for the last minute
Follow the guys

716
01:14:11,430 --> 01:14:15,530
the truth. I made a ticket at the last minute
Do you know how terrible it is?

717
01:14:15,570 --> 01:14:17,240
There must be contact

718
01:14:19,130 --> 01:14:20,200
Everything's gotta happen

719
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:25,710
You can see your uncle saw it
That there must have been a crazy fort here

720
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:30,440
Here's your treatment
Good thing

721
01:14:30,440 --> 01:14:34,960
First start with you
Ask her questions why do you answer?

722
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:37,500
Today is a fasting day

723
01:14:41,800 --> 01:14:43,900
She feels indignant
Do not laugh so hard

724
01:14:45,470 --> 01:14:47,920
How could I spend my time in this village?

725
01:14:48,860 --> 01:14:50,310
Well, you got it

726
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:55,530
Your cousin is himself
But my brother will change

727
01:14:58,070 --> 01:15:01,800
What's your point?
Start playing background music

728
01:17:44,330 --> 01:17:45,480
I did a good job

729
01:18:26,420 --> 01:18:28,380
Was he slapping the cheek?

730
01:18:29,290 --> 01:18:30,630
Because of the song

731
01:18:30,630 --> 01:18:33,350
Is this a Sinhala Singer?

732
01:18:33,830 --> 01:18:36,600
But how happy is Wisram?
Did you see it?

733
01:18:36,600 --> 01:18:41,990
I will not look at his dancing. Today is my son-in-law
Whatever he does will be remembered

734
01:18:41,990 --> 01:18:43,350
What?

735
01:18:46,330 --> 01:18:50,120
You really love that girl, right?

736
01:18:50,120 --> 01:18:54,110
Today the world sees your love

737
01:19:01,380 --> 01:19:03,080
How is this curtain lost?

738
01:19:06,050 --> 01:19:09,720
Here is the village. At night, the currants disappear

739
01:19:11,580 --> 01:19:15,070
It's good to go Currant
I'll make your marriage

740
01:19:15,850 --> 01:19:17,540
I'll show you the ability

741
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:29,690
They're so bad
No, I did not

742
01:19:30,420 --> 01:19:33,920
Your unions are asleep. Sawtimors I'm sleeping
Give the slices

743
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:37,470
Those energies? She'll get up

744
01:19:37,790 --> 01:19:39,940
Kill? No, I will not

745
01:19:46,170 --> 01:19:49,840
Cake? Brought
Balloon? Brought
Spraying?

746
01:19:50,840 --> 01:19:54,180
What are we doing here in my brother's birthday?

747
01:19:54,690 --> 01:19:59,690
If you gave your brother's birthday cake
Get some fun. Take it as a gift

748
01:20:12,100 --> 01:20:14,930
Who is it? It looks like Rishi

749
01:20:14,930 --> 01:20:17,700
Who are they?

750
01:20:23,930 --> 01:20:26,840
God's lights

751
01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:30,260
Did you just tell me about sleeping pills?

752
01:20:36,830 --> 01:20:41,050
What happened? Saitri is really great

753
01:20:41,050 --> 01:20:46,250
How do you know? Today too
I'm sleeping in Buruma's place

754
01:20:46,250 --> 01:20:47,110
Burma?

755
01:20:54,500 --> 01:20:57,330
I'm going to this guy's back

756
01:20:57,330 --> 01:21:01,830
I'm sitting at her. KÇ£gÃ¦huvot
I beat

757
01:21:04,920 --> 01:21:08,920
Beirut, why is this?
What is he doing right now? Run

758
01:21:10,410 --> 01:21:13,780
Threats are not good either
It's brought

759
01:21:13,780 --> 01:21:17,130
Which room are you in?

760
01:21:17,130 --> 01:21:18,990
My burner
What?

761
01:21:30,350 --> 01:21:32,000
He did not see it

762
01:21:35,700 --> 01:21:37,730
Do not tell Rishni that we are here

763
01:21:37,730 --> 01:21:40,480
Then give a hat
I have a hat

764
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:43,190
Listen, Rishi
Here you go

765
01:21:44,260 --> 01:21:47,720
At a good balloon, Alsaria

766
01:21:47,720 --> 01:21:50,610
Give the balloons
This is gone

767
01:21:53,990 --> 01:21:57,370
My little spit
My beautiful spit

768
01:22:01,690 --> 01:22:04,150
Playing the wedding from a very early age

769
01:22:25,060 --> 01:22:28,840
How Beautiful Looks? See this nose
See this lips

770
01:22:28,940 --> 01:22:31,840
Not much lower

771
01:22:34,250 --> 01:22:35,950
Why did you hit me on the cheek?

772
01:22:37,500 --> 01:22:38,600
Okay

773
01:22:43,370 --> 01:22:46,880
This was down when the cheek was thrown
PUT?

774
01:22:51,250 --> 01:22:56,810
I'm not a buddy
Stay

775
01:23:10,180 --> 01:23:12,480
Aiya's birthday cake
what is doing?

776
01:23:13,560 --> 01:23:14,490
Ivarakaranavada?

777
01:23:20,380 --> 01:23:21,410
What did you do?

778
01:23:33,510 --> 01:23:35,370
Follow me
Let's teach them a good lesson

779
01:23:44,430 --> 01:23:46,860
Did you come to see him, did not you?
Who?

780
01:23:47,740 --> 01:23:51,400
RagapÄnavada? Stop the play and say why

781
01:23:51,400 --> 01:23:55,750
Brother's birthday tomorrow. Big people in the village
Came to speak

782
01:23:55,770 --> 01:23:59,900
Big people? You are
Are you talking? will come

783
01:24:00,780 --> 01:24:04,910
I count three
Start counting

784
01:24:07,540 --> 01:24:10,460
Quickly went. Where did I go?

785
01:24:20,590 --> 01:24:22,010
Sees
No

786
01:24:23,370 --> 01:24:25,140
Sees
No

787
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:39,220
I told you not to see
What happened to you? I'm finished

788
01:24:39,280 --> 01:24:39,980
Do you?

789
01:24:42,460 --> 01:24:43,620
Sithith's sister, right?

790
01:24:44,580 --> 01:24:46,190
Do not get me wrong

791
01:24:46,190 --> 01:24:52,220
How'd you talk to Dad?
I understand what a boy is. But he does not understand

792
01:24:52,220 --> 01:24:54,910
Got it. But do not say

793
01:24:55,210 --> 01:24:58,010
Get rid of the marriage reluctantly
You have the strength

794
01:24:58,400 --> 01:25:01,120
But tell me if you do not like the boy
I did not have a squeam

795
01:25:01,120 --> 01:25:04,290
How do you know?
do not ask. Love the art

796
01:25:05,140 --> 01:25:09,500
He came to marry. It means knowing it

797
01:25:09,500 --> 01:25:10,880
Why So Believed?

798
01:25:10,880 --> 01:25:15,580
I told her several times to him
I'll love you wholeheartedly

799
01:25:16,050 --> 01:25:18,300
My love was so confident

800
01:25:19,110 --> 01:25:22,420
There's nothing left. Your nurse is very pretty

801
01:25:29,430 --> 01:25:31,960
He got a good boy

802
01:25:44,310 --> 01:25:47,620
Is it home? You know that

803
01:25:47,620 --> 01:25:50,860
You're what happened last night
I do not know.
What do you say?

804
01:25:50,860 --> 01:25:54,070
Nightshirt and his friends come
I messed up a lot

805
01:25:54,070 --> 01:25:56,250
Are you coming? Leave him

806
01:25:56,250 --> 01:26:00,270
Boy, you want to marry him
Now you can go to America

807
01:26:00,990 --> 01:26:01,560
What happened?

808
01:26:03,190 --> 01:26:04,630
I'll get married

809
01:26:19,480 --> 01:26:21,160
You play well

810
01:26:22,500 --> 01:26:26,950
You do not know what we did at night
Are you cycling well?

811
01:26:26,950 --> 01:26:28,850
Listen to me. come here

812
01:26:30,510 --> 01:26:33,200
You're talking. Come on
Why are they talking?

813
01:26:33,200 --> 01:26:36,360
If you are talking in front
What can I know?

814
01:26:36,360 --> 01:26:38,360
Why are you there? Come on

815
01:26:39,340 --> 01:26:41,860
You know about the night
What are you doing now?

816
01:26:41,860 --> 01:26:45,680
It's like a swell of legs
Let's go

817
01:26:45,680 --> 01:26:49,770
He survived night, is not he? Now see how to get involved

818
01:26:49,770 --> 01:26:54,130
What are they taking?
You must be
Get chairs

819
01:26:55,930 --> 01:26:56,680
Why was he talking?

820
01:26:56,680 --> 01:27:01,070
Play is talking
You're so smart

821
01:27:09,730 --> 01:27:13,140
My luck is over. Other than this
There's nothing else to do

822
01:27:13,140 --> 01:27:17,890
What's this? Why did you do this?
How about this or something else?

823
01:27:22,590 --> 01:27:26,480
Do not play the play like you do not know
Are you talking?

824
01:27:26,480 --> 01:27:27,420
what is doing?

825
01:27:29,660 --> 01:27:31,250
Playing cards with dad

826
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,130
my daughter

827
01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:54,050
Joker? He had his will
What's your situation?

828
01:27:54,050 --> 01:27:57,930
I could have run over. Just missed it
What's the card you came in?

829
01:27:59,490 --> 01:28:01,370
The queen came
Lucky

830
01:28:01,370 --> 01:28:03,380
I wanted a king

831
01:28:03,740 --> 01:28:07,210
You need a king. I need the queen

832
01:28:07,420 --> 01:28:10,010
You have more power than me

833
01:28:18,380 --> 01:28:20,190
Why is it so late?

834
01:28:20,810 --> 01:28:23,220
Why are you playing cards with him?

835
01:28:23,220 --> 01:28:25,320
What happened? Is he our enemy?

836
01:28:25,750 --> 01:28:29,730
Tomorrow if our Satchithra's girlfriend got married, he would
Do not give cards?

837
01:28:29,730 --> 01:28:33,050
it is not.
She's good if I'm good

838
01:28:33,530 --> 01:28:35,830
If he's bad, I'm very bad

839
01:28:37,450 --> 01:28:40,430
As long as you show her face

840
01:28:47,150 --> 01:28:49,010
Go. We do not care about this

841
01:28:51,030 --> 01:28:56,510
Did you come to apologize for being slapped?
Or is it okay?

842
01:28:58,010 --> 01:29:01,280
It's like sinking
Say something else

843
01:29:01,680 --> 01:29:05,600
I do not know how much I came here

844
01:29:06,130 --> 01:29:09,800
I came to see you alone by taking the heat
Another in the future

845
01:29:09,800 --> 01:29:15,060
I understand everything. But you do not understand
I'm going to marry

846
01:29:15,810 --> 01:29:19,700
You can not concentrate on my marriage when you come
Get out of here

847
01:29:20,090 --> 01:29:23,830
I do not care about you. No love

848
01:29:24,060 --> 01:29:26,980
Look at this. Leave me

849
01:29:58,110 --> 01:29:59,690
They just came

850
01:30:10,580 --> 01:30:13,140
My little daughter's marriage

851
01:30:13,870 --> 01:30:17,020
Her wedding invitation card
Leave and offer yourselves

852
01:30:23,940 --> 01:30:25,610
What happened?
See her

853
01:30:25,610 --> 01:30:28,080
See how it works

854
01:30:28,840 --> 01:30:31,230
Control it

855
01:30:32,140 --> 01:30:34,740
I sacrificed. Now we can divide the marriage certificate

856
01:30:34,740 --> 01:30:37,970
Well

857
01:30:40,940 --> 01:30:42,710
Why does he do that?

858
01:30:43,680 --> 01:30:44,190
Let's go

859
01:30:46,350 --> 01:30:50,830
Because you played the cards, you defeated him
The first invitation is going to give you

860
01:30:53,530 --> 01:30:57,760
Do something
What can I do? Get the cards from them
Except, there's nothing else to do

861
01:30:57,760 --> 01:30:59,530
Wait a minute
They always talk about them

862
01:31:01,460 --> 01:31:02,460
Listen

863
01:31:05,630 --> 01:31:08,850
Pandith said the first card was God
To give it to someone like me

864
01:31:09,590 --> 01:31:11,910
This village is like God

865
01:31:13,770 --> 01:31:17,620
Where would you find someone better than you?
Show

866
01:31:20,580 --> 01:31:21,940
Come to marriage

867
01:31:21,940 --> 01:31:24,950
Brother Rush
Let's go

868
01:31:31,540 --> 01:31:36,260
Because your uncle. Have not you seen it?
Now I have the comfort

869
01:31:36,260 --> 01:31:38,930
Savitri's marriage is the first card
He's got it

870
01:31:39,710 --> 01:31:42,580
Your sacrifices worked well

871
01:31:43,590 --> 01:31:45,790
Come to the wedding
Sightseeing

872
01:31:49,170 --> 01:31:51,530
Uncle, little bit

873
01:32:01,590 --> 01:32:03,940
My mother loved this play

874
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:06,730
Stop

875
01:32:07,610 --> 01:32:12,110
This is a scandal

876
01:32:12,910 --> 01:32:17,370
But today I teach him a good lesson

877
01:32:17,370 --> 01:32:20,910
My mantras
What do you say?

878
01:32:22,490 --> 01:32:28,830
The sunshine. Now I'm with no one
Can not stop

879
01:32:28,830 --> 01:32:30,090
What does she say?

880
01:32:30,090 --> 01:32:35,360
Everything about Lankan cronies
I have control

881
01:32:35,360 --> 01:32:39,620
This night, Kali will be the last night
You will be the wedding night

882
01:32:39,620 --> 01:32:43,640
I give you every headache

883
01:32:43,640 --> 01:32:46,400
Your marriage will be
His

884
01:32:47,640 --> 01:32:50,700
What do you say? Where are you going?

885
01:32:53,930 --> 01:32:59,250
At 3.20, you're ready
I'm going

886
01:33:21,590 --> 01:33:22,900
Now what do you need to do?

887
01:33:22,900 --> 01:33:26,700
You go to the North South

888
01:33:29,600 --> 01:33:31,100
Why is there a bag?

889
01:33:31,100 --> 01:33:36,640
You have not seen anything until now
Now, you will show me my real image

890
01:33:37,190 --> 01:33:38,140
Will you hang up?

891
01:33:40,050 --> 01:33:42,100
Uncle is crazy
Get out

892
01:33:42,410 --> 01:33:45,330
I'll stay here
Go there. There are chances

893
01:33:45,330 --> 01:33:49,310
I'll wait here for you to go
I came first
Take my place?

894
01:34:03,810 --> 01:34:04,880
As if there are anyone

895
01:34:05,770 --> 01:34:09,980
Do not you, do not worry
He's here for us

896
01:34:20,410 --> 01:34:24,430
Is he with us?
He'll beat us

897
01:34:30,620 --> 01:34:33,120
Why Did He Do It? Put the lights on

898
01:34:42,820 --> 01:34:45,620
You got us freaked out, are not you?
What did you say?

899
01:34:46,050 --> 01:34:48,410
Why did you bite us?

900
01:34:48,410 --> 01:34:52,000
Lankan's concept is uncle
Antilles

901
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:56,140
Wait. For 10 minutes to fight
I have that

902
01:34:56,890 --> 01:35:00,370
Uncle said not to change the situation
that's fine

903
01:35:05,670 --> 01:35:10,440
Do not move anyone from their places
Do not look back

904
01:35:10,440 --> 01:35:13,420
Do not say anything

905
01:35:13,420 --> 01:35:16,200
Stop the nonsense pooja
First, hit him

906
01:35:20,560 --> 01:35:23,990
In the eighth place
Unclear

907
01:35:29,300 --> 01:35:33,150
What's the rest?
Just let it out

908
01:35:33,550 --> 01:35:35,380
Want a pause?
Yes

909
01:35:38,270 --> 01:35:40,560
I beat him well, right?
I'm angry with you

910
01:35:40,870 --> 01:35:43,450
Tell shajjov
Average

911
01:35:43,910 --> 01:35:46,330
It's so heavy. Are you normal?

912
01:36:10,920 --> 01:36:13,730
You're Tarzan
I was born in jail

913
01:36:14,020 --> 01:36:18,320
How long has it been? 2 minutes
I'm left alone

914
01:36:18,580 --> 01:36:23,530
A little request
What? For the last 2 days, I did not give him that one

915
01:36:23,530 --> 01:36:27,490
Slowly
This month is not discounted

916
01:36:36,230 --> 01:36:37,710
The priest is finished?

917
01:36:37,710 --> 01:36:41,320
Gravity of the trists and the lunar deaths

918
01:36:41,320 --> 01:36:46,020
I'm not talking to you today

919
01:36:46,780 --> 01:36:50,570
I'm not talking

920
01:36:50,570 --> 01:36:51,990
But I can hit

921
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:56,270
We were scolded because of uncle

922
01:36:57,310 --> 01:37:02,930
Firestorm had a fire. On the northeast
It was time. Right corner gives you

923
01:37:03,030 --> 01:37:06,540
He controlled us
On the four sides

924
01:37:06,540 --> 01:37:09,920
New Earths
Last of all

925
01:37:09,920 --> 01:37:12,380
I could not do anything

926
01:37:13,560 --> 01:37:16,060
That's right. I'll handle it

927
01:37:21,680 --> 01:37:24,260
What happened? He broke the car?
Where should I go?

928
01:37:24,260 --> 01:37:27,340
Do not bother. He sent me
He's coming in

929
01:37:27,340 --> 01:37:29,860
It's going to fix the car
Come on

930
01:37:32,350 --> 01:37:36,430
Sit in the back
If my brother comes in, tell me he's gone

931
01:37:54,560 --> 01:37:58,370
what is doing? Hack. Fall
There is no nearby hospital

932
01:38:00,530 --> 01:38:01,490
What's this?

933
01:38:01,490 --> 01:38:05,070
You had to come in with your family freely
Why did you come by train?

934
01:38:05,070 --> 01:38:09,100
I like Indian culture
I would like to see nature

935
01:38:09,100 --> 01:38:11,110
Okay. How is this trip?

936
01:38:11,110 --> 01:38:13,890
It's very bad. Never again
Do not go

937
01:38:16,480 --> 01:38:21,080
You are Satchithi's brother, are not you?
One more time, ask what's going on

938
01:38:21,080 --> 01:38:23,820
This is our relative. She came to work in the field

939
01:38:23,820 --> 01:38:28,210
Work in the field. This is a matter of responsibility
You're doing a wonderful job

940
01:38:28,210 --> 01:38:31,210
Peaceful. Calm

941
01:38:35,410 --> 01:38:36,750
Why take pictures of buffalo?

942
01:38:56,880 --> 01:38:57,930
Come on

943
01:39:08,710 --> 01:39:11,550
Did you open my bridegroom's house?

944
01:39:12,260 --> 01:39:16,610
How's he doing? It's called to know
I'm afraid to face the face

945
01:39:17,130 --> 01:39:21,510
What do you say? Others praise you
It's chattering

946
01:39:25,220 --> 01:39:28,440
She's crazy. It does not
I understand

947
01:39:29,620 --> 01:39:33,270
Not so innocent. You do not understand
Do not know why

948
01:39:34,650 --> 01:39:40,310
Sathithri's marriage is done by something
If it was with you, it would be fun

949
01:39:43,970 --> 01:39:46,740
No, no, no, no
The family of the bridegroom arrived

950
01:39:47,300 --> 01:39:51,260
Dad is calling you
Tell my brother

951
01:39:59,280 --> 01:40:04,190
Krishna does not appear
He went to the temple with his family
Then comes

952
01:40:08,480 --> 01:40:09,410
This is my wife

953
01:40:10,220 --> 01:40:11,550
This is my little daughter

954
01:40:13,090 --> 01:40:15,420
This is my eldest daughter
Nephew

955
01:40:18,230 --> 01:40:21,070
Your daughter is on the Sedi train in the S2 train ride

956
01:40:36,880 --> 01:40:40,220
Why is she running away from us?
He did not recognize us

957
01:40:47,400 --> 01:40:49,490
Move
Sasi

958
01:40:49,490 --> 01:40:52,320
Why are you scared? They came

959
01:40:52,320 --> 01:40:54,730
who is?
Couple on the train

960
01:40:55,060 --> 01:40:59,980
Why did they come? Did anyone invite them?
The girl is the bride's groom

961
01:41:03,560 --> 01:41:06,080
Unfortunately, a misplaced snake
I'm dancing like that

962
01:41:06,080 --> 01:41:09,640
Rishi on one side. On the other side are these
You can not do anything

963
01:41:10,060 --> 01:41:14,250
If they find out about us?
What should be? The previous time went brighter

964
01:41:14,250 --> 01:41:16,790
This time the coins go
Will they know?

965
01:41:16,790 --> 01:41:19,460
Family? Rishi now talks about everything

966
01:41:19,460 --> 01:41:21,990
He'll do whatever he wants to break your marriage

967
01:41:22,570 --> 01:41:27,570
Rishi does not do that
What did you say? I know him

968
01:41:27,620 --> 01:41:30,310
what is going on? You're more than him
Think

969
01:41:30,310 --> 01:41:35,560
Stop this crazy talk and tell him
Tell no one about this

970
01:41:47,520 --> 01:41:53,370
Why are you here, Saitry?
Rizhett is here. Why are they both calm?

971
01:41:53,370 --> 01:41:57,940
What's going on here? I told you, did not I?
There's a doubt

972
01:42:02,760 --> 01:42:07,000
If the Vardam question is resolved, it's at the Kovil
You can fix it

973
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:12,530
It's better than hitting Rizzie's leg
He has a one-day step forward

974
01:42:13,080 --> 01:42:16,880
When I love your younger sister
You beat me a lot

975
01:42:16,880 --> 01:42:19,870
Whenever he touches, no one leaves his marks

976
01:42:20,130 --> 01:42:22,140
Take action early

977
01:42:34,670 --> 01:42:37,720
Now I get it. Why do I like Indian culture?

978
01:42:37,720 --> 01:42:41,400
My sister is an Indian in the United States
Tied. I like it. Do not worry

979
01:42:43,010 --> 01:42:48,630
Is Saitry here a girlfriend? He's a ritual
Abide by. That's why I like Indian culture

980
01:42:48,630 --> 01:42:53,270
You are a good person
Do you know me Well, everyone knows the drinks

981
01:42:55,170 --> 01:43:01,030
Leave my talk. What are you doing here?
Because there was little work, she came

982
01:43:07,370 --> 01:43:10,820
Who's talking? Girlfriend?

983
01:43:10,820 --> 01:43:13,940
She loved him. But she does not know

984
01:43:16,910 --> 01:43:20,950
Readin 'my love from my home.
Tell your love story

985
01:43:27,280 --> 01:43:30,860
The love of his eyes shows the anger of the story

986
01:43:32,020 --> 01:43:36,460
I love him very much

987
01:43:36,650 --> 01:43:38,280
This is a love story

988
01:43:41,170 --> 01:43:44,570
You saved my marriage. I'm your marriage
Are not you going to save?

989
01:43:49,900 --> 01:43:55,440
How many times have I called? Did not you take it?
Do not want to know where you are from

990
01:43:55,740 --> 01:43:58,310
Meet me back in 10 minutes from home

991
01:44:08,850 --> 01:44:11,050
It's better not to eat fish here

992
01:44:13,140 --> 01:44:15,070
Sissy, how are you?

993
01:44:19,630 --> 01:44:22,680
Thank you. There is little work

994
01:44:29,610 --> 01:44:30,830
Where is Saatchi?

995
01:44:31,670 --> 01:44:35,240
Somewhere out there
Are you with your eyes?

996
01:44:35,870 --> 01:44:36,780
No

997
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:42,920
Why did not she come yet?

998
01:44:53,130 --> 01:44:56,970
Thank you for coming
There's something important to talk to you about

999
01:44:58,240 --> 01:45:02,190
I told the guys in advance
He does not say anything to the bride

1000
01:45:02,190 --> 01:45:06,680
I know this beforehand. It's not for that
I am afraid

1001
01:45:06,680 --> 01:45:08,450
I came across you

1002
01:45:08,960 --> 01:45:13,920
But do you think you're afraid of me?
But you're getting used to getting married to yourself, right? The blame
You're scared

1003
01:45:13,920 --> 01:45:18,540
This is not right
Because of an unknown person
One who knows is marrying

1004
01:45:18,970 --> 01:45:22,790
Those who do not know can not get caught
I'm going to talk

1005
01:45:24,290 --> 01:45:29,520
Talk. Not me
Your mind

1006
01:45:30,020 --> 01:45:31,600
See the answer

1007
01:45:32,300 --> 01:45:35,600
And even if she refused
Going forever

1008
01:45:36,520 --> 01:45:39,010
They will never come back
Why do you always talk like that?

1009
01:45:39,010 --> 01:45:41,800
This is a matter of my life
I do not have any idea

1010
01:45:43,650 --> 01:45:49,690
Do you see a joke? I'm drunk
Admit it. But you do not have more heart than your heart

1011
01:45:49,790 --> 01:45:52,940
There is a two-foot gap between us

1012
01:45:53,560 --> 01:45:56,200
If you came to me

1013
01:45:57,350 --> 01:45:58,920
We will never be separated

1014
01:46:00,360 --> 01:46:03,620
Understand my love

1015
01:46:04,340 --> 01:46:07,480
I can not be without you now
True

1016
01:46:08,960 --> 01:46:10,380
I will not be able to live

1017
01:46:16,820 --> 01:46:18,990
go in

1018
01:46:31,380 --> 01:46:33,390
I teach you a good lesson

1019
01:46:38,010 --> 01:46:41,110
Why did you come here?

1020
01:46:52,030 --> 01:46:56,530
How much effort on my arm?
Everyone will know

1021
01:46:57,950 --> 01:47:00,830
Your brother can not answer

1022
01:47:03,640 --> 01:47:06,860
What's the answer?

1023
01:47:08,300 --> 01:47:11,010
You go inside
Wait a minute

1024
01:47:12,320 --> 01:47:16,430
How many years will it hide?
Ask your brother

1025
01:47:16,430 --> 01:47:18,890
What about?

1026
01:47:19,650 --> 01:47:24,240
The culture of prestige
Love is worth it

1027
01:47:24,240 --> 01:47:27,980
But save your brother first

1028
01:47:28,650 --> 01:47:29,760
Killing love

1029
01:47:30,900 --> 01:47:35,860
Do you know what you're saying?
How much do I care about my family? do you know?

1030
01:47:35,860 --> 01:47:41,280
You're not your family to save your fame
I'm thinking a lot

1031
01:47:41,830 --> 01:47:44,520
It's more your interest in your brother

1032
01:47:44,960 --> 01:47:49,770
I'll admit it. He's my brother. He's mine
What's wrong with trying to save honor?

1033
01:47:49,770 --> 01:47:55,000
This is your big daughter. Happy before the wedding
Closed after the wedding

1034
01:47:55,290 --> 01:47:56,590
What does that mean?

1035
01:47:59,320 --> 01:48:03,390
You do not know. My daughter-in-law is happy

1036
01:48:03,390 --> 01:48:05,430
Go and your daughter

1037
01:48:06,650 --> 01:48:08,930
Call me son-in-law

1038
01:48:20,080 --> 01:48:23,420
His name is Gayatri. Tell your nephew

1039
01:48:24,340 --> 01:48:29,440
Let me tell you one thing. Bind your little daughter
A man in the village lives there for 20 years

1040
01:48:29,440 --> 01:48:33,640
His men are in there. Was one
Now I'm going to hit

1041
01:48:41,360 --> 01:48:45,560
20 years ago, this is on your sister
There was a wrong look

1042
01:48:48,200 --> 01:48:52,870
This is the wrong thing about your daughter
He strikes you in front of your eyes

1043
01:49:00,520 --> 01:49:05,990
Hit him

1044
01:49:08,380 --> 01:49:13,550
Why are you okay? However much he tried
The truth can not be hidden

1045
01:49:14,600 --> 01:49:17,590
Rishi is the truth

1046
01:49:35,640 --> 01:49:43,090
He's out of the house. Come in
It's easy for you. But you believe that you will come out for him

1047
01:49:52,170 --> 01:49:57,630
I did not love anyone at the time. So somewhere
Do not understand

1048
01:49:57,630 --> 01:50:01,430
So I got caught. You said about me
It's not your fault

1049
01:50:01,960 --> 01:50:06,710
My mistake. I did not have a goal
But you do not

1050
01:50:06,710 --> 01:50:11,710
You know where to go
But you do not know how to proceed

1051
01:50:31,540 --> 01:50:34,970
It's not right to think of yourself

1052
01:50:35,720 --> 01:50:40,680
Just a minute to lose love
But it is not enough to have a lifetime

1053
01:50:41,840 --> 01:50:45,110
What do you want to think?

1054
01:50:49,140 --> 01:50:55,580
I'm saying this to me
Do not be yourself

1055
01:51:04,880 --> 01:51:09,740
She was very sensual in this way

1056
01:51:09,740 --> 01:51:12,560
Do not hit him
Listen

1057
01:51:13,060 --> 01:51:17,470
Another time, try another one
If you glaze at you, you will not save your eyes

1058
01:51:17,960 --> 01:51:20,620
Listen. Just figure it out

1059
01:51:20,620 --> 01:51:27,130
I've stayed for 20 years. Patience for another 20 years
Habits

1060
01:51:35,860 --> 01:51:39,500
Your love is happening to the boy

1061
01:51:39,900 --> 01:51:42,610
They see my love in their way

1062
01:51:44,520 --> 01:51:47,460
After all this distance, I do not mind

1063
01:51:48,700 --> 01:51:54,760
I'm here until her marriage
Not going anywhere

1064
01:51:54,980 --> 01:51:57,970
Marry him

1065
01:51:59,130 --> 01:52:03,150
She's always upset. Make him a decision
It's a little late

1066
01:52:03,970 --> 01:52:07,300
You go work. I'm here
I'll sit down

1067
01:52:34,130 --> 01:52:35,190
Come on, Papa
Sit

1068
01:52:36,320 --> 01:52:39,170
If you do not like this marriage, I would have told you

1069
01:52:39,170 --> 01:52:44,990
I wanted to yell at everyone in that courtyard
I do not like this marriage

1070
01:52:45,310 --> 01:52:49,590
But I could not talk. I saw my mother that day

1071
01:52:49,970 --> 01:52:55,790
I noticed the Little Boar. They're all from home
The girl who escaped came back

1072
01:52:55,960 --> 01:52:59,100
Everyone was happy. Then I saw you

1073
01:52:59,980 --> 01:53:05,590
My eldest daughter is getting married
You raised your face from your mouth. I sailed

1074
01:53:06,820 --> 01:53:08,890
Do not worry about me

1075
01:53:09,790 --> 01:53:14,790
I can handle it. But today or not
Tomorrow I will join my husband

1076
01:53:15,590 --> 01:53:17,670
But think of the little person

1077
01:53:22,350 --> 01:53:24,060
It made me a big mistake

1078
01:53:31,720 --> 01:53:35,110
Happiness does not make a big difference

1079
01:53:36,610 --> 01:53:38,810
You tried to give me a pleasure

1080
01:53:40,430 --> 01:53:42,800
My daughter was sad

1081
01:53:44,840 --> 01:53:49,160
You know what these people need more than me
Give it to them

1082
01:57:24,380 --> 01:57:29,380
The doors are sitting. Time is right
Do not you hear? Let's go

1083
01:57:31,690 --> 01:57:34,550
What happened? Getting out
It's over

1084
01:57:34,550 --> 01:57:37,460
Why did you call me? Why can not I move my foot forward?

1085
01:57:38,660 --> 01:57:41,400
Sahti wants to marry?

1086
01:57:42,180 --> 01:57:45,750
But the joy in that picture
Why is not my face today?

1087
01:57:49,420 --> 01:57:51,340
All the girls are scared before the wedding

1088
01:57:51,340 --> 01:57:54,850
I'm not afraid. Angry
Who's he?

1089
01:57:55,160 --> 01:57:58,430
Talk to you and open up for me
The one to wait

1090
01:57:58,790 --> 01:58:02,650
He says he'll love me
I'm not telling you this guy

1091
01:58:03,070 --> 01:58:05,910
I love him, too
There is faith

1092
01:58:06,330 --> 01:58:10,370
You love me, do not you? About me
Do you think so?

1093
01:58:10,600 --> 01:58:13,440
Then how does he know only?
What's in my mind?

1094
01:58:15,430 --> 01:58:21,270
Every girl may have been like this.
If you fight with your mind, you will be happy
Or it's sad

1095
01:58:22,620 --> 01:58:24,550
He made me understand

1096
01:58:32,610 --> 01:58:37,110
I made a big mistake to my sister's marriage
I will not make that mistake again

1097
01:58:40,560 --> 01:58:43,440
Every home has a girl who can not understand

1098
01:58:45,120 --> 01:58:47,400
This is what I learned today

1099
01:58:49,170 --> 01:58:51,020
I'm a worthless father

1100
01:58:52,750 --> 01:58:58,590
The dream come true for the wedding day
Can not say. This is not your daughter's fault

1101
01:59:03,610 --> 01:59:08,920
That boy is what you did for yourself
He must have understood his love

1102
01:59:10,220 --> 01:59:16,230
It was a mistake for your sister
I do not commit this mistake today

1103
01:59:17,800 --> 01:59:19,910
Where did you meet him? Tell

1104
01:59:21,880 --> 01:59:24,750
He told us about everyone

1105
02:00:02,180 --> 02:00:05,250
If this is the case,
Get married

1106
02:00:08,760 --> 02:00:11,670
Is there a storm inside and is there a chapel here?

1107
02:00:12,710 --> 02:00:15,500
Go out and lie down?
Rising

1108
02:00:15,500 --> 02:00:18,080
After this, this place is mine

1109
02:00:25,840 --> 02:00:30,150
What's going on here? What
Is there a battering rampage for you?

1110
02:00:31,320 --> 02:00:34,270
About an hour, I was in the tabernacle
I'm bored. I'm bored

1111
02:00:34,670 --> 02:00:36,630
How many mosquitoes do you know?

1112
02:00:40,850 --> 02:00:42,110
The females ran away, right?

1113
02:00:43,850 --> 02:00:47,410
You guys needed a bridegroom abroad?
You had to find someone here

1114
02:00:48,650 --> 02:00:55,210
The average fat people are at the age of sixty. Foreigners
People love to get caught in love

1115
02:00:56,960 --> 02:01:02,970
How much I spent on clothes
It's going to ruin everything... old patrimony...
