Written and directed by:
Satyajit Ray

6
00:03:50,786 --> 00:03:51,729
Ananta!

7
00:03:52,888 --> 00:03:53,544
Master!

8
00:03:53,905 --> 00:03:55,649
Which month is it?

9
00:03:57,829 --> 00:03:58,867
Falgun, Master.

10
00:03:59,545 --> 00:04:01,014
Is it spring?

11
00:04:01,402 --> 00:04:03,217
Yes, Master,

12
00:04:03,399 --> 00:04:06,374
the "muchkunda" are in bloom.
Do you want some?

13
00:05:34,577 --> 00:05:35,688
Ananta!

14
00:05:37,384 --> 00:05:37,933
Master!

15
00:05:38,576 --> 00:05:40,212
Where does that music come from?

16
00:05:40,432 --> 00:05:41,615
From the Ganguli's place.

17
00:05:41,834 --> 00:05:42,777
Where?

18
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:45,368
From Ganguli Babu's house,
Master!

19
00:05:45,548 --> 00:05:46,659
Go and fetch the steward.

20
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:47,995
Yes, Master!

21
00:05:52,801 --> 00:05:54,891
Pessanna Babu!
Pessanna Babu!

22
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:58,681
Lord Roy is calling you.

23
00:05:58,897 --> 00:05:59,662
Who?

24
00:05:59,843 --> 00:06:02,494
Master Roy! He's on
the terrace. Hurry up.

25
00:06:07,111 --> 00:06:09,870
Why is the Shehnai
played at Mahim's?

26
00:06:10,054 --> 00:06:12,920
For his sors initiation,
Master.

27
00:06:23,331 --> 00:06:26,449
Is it the Shehnai
of Bande Ali?

28
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:27,987
Yes, Master.

29
00:06:29,043 --> 00:06:30,894
Have I been invited?

30
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:31,982
Yes.

31
00:06:32,406 --> 00:06:34,496
Did he come in person?

32
00:06:34,929 --> 00:06:37,198
No, Master.
A written invitation.

33
00:06:38,818 --> 00:06:40,383
Will you go?

34
00:06:42,146 --> 00:06:43,615
Am I going somewhere?

35
00:06:44,633 --> 00:06:45,612
No, Master.

36
00:06:46,315 --> 00:06:47,534
So?

37
00:06:55,565 --> 00:06:57,381
I've brought your syrup.

38
00:06:57,597 --> 00:06:59,233
Put it there.

39
00:07:48,189 --> 00:07:49,754
The initiation.

40
00:09:11,293 --> 00:09:12,691
A letter from the bank.

41
00:09:12,905 --> 00:09:13,597
What do they say?

42
00:09:13,781 --> 00:09:15,561
They say...

43
00:09:24,818 --> 00:09:25,654
No credit?

44
00:09:25,869 --> 00:09:26,944
No, Master.

45
00:09:27,165 --> 00:09:29,469
They say the overdraft
already exceeds...

46
00:09:29,688 --> 00:09:33,642
...the limits of
banking payment.

47
00:09:36,755 --> 00:09:38,989
Master!
Mahim has come to see you,

48
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:40,952
will you receive him?

49
00:09:41,275 --> 00:09:41,967
Mahim?

50
00:09:42,186 --> 00:09:45,017
Janardan Ganguli's son, Master.

51
00:09:45,795 --> 00:09:47,503
This usurer's son?

52
00:09:47,686 --> 00:09:52,023
He wants the exploitation rights
for the river sandbank.

53
00:09:53,992 --> 00:09:55,533
Him?

54
00:09:55,709 --> 00:09:57,668
Yes, Master. He's rich.

55
00:09:57,882 --> 00:10:00,928
A business in town,
a house in the village.

56
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:02,322
Really?

57
00:10:02,542 --> 00:10:04,393
Will you accept to hear him?

58
00:10:04,608 --> 00:10:08,037
The coffers are empty,
spending is important...

59
00:10:08,253 --> 00:10:11,048
Call him!
In the music room.

60
00:11:23,014 --> 00:11:24,304
Come in.

61
00:11:37,099 --> 00:11:38,915
You are the son of
Janardan Ganguli?

62
00:11:39,131 --> 00:11:40,242
Yes.

63
00:11:41,304 --> 00:11:42,904
What did you put in the syrup?

64
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:46,696
Some muchkunda petals.

65
00:11:46,909 --> 00:11:48,378
It's perfumed.

66
00:11:52,095 --> 00:11:53,910
You took over the business?

67
00:11:57,770 --> 00:11:58,917
Which rate?

68
00:11:59,521 --> 00:12:00,632
What?

69
00:12:04,603 --> 00:12:07,684
If you work on
Roy territory,

70
00:12:08,035 --> 00:12:11,320
you'll have to abide
by some rules.

71
00:12:11,539 --> 00:12:13,390
Yes yes, I know.

72
00:12:15,709 --> 00:12:20,224
Maximum monthly interest is 1%.

73
00:12:21,174 --> 00:12:23,694
Nothing on overdue taxes,

74
00:12:23,907 --> 00:12:26,176
no seizure,

75
00:12:26,395 --> 00:12:29,010
never bring a lawsuit.
You know that?

76
00:12:31,229 --> 00:12:35,004
I know. We remember
your kindness, Master.

77
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,645
Where have you been before?

78
00:12:42,861 --> 00:12:45,763
I spent almost 20 years
in the west,

79
00:12:46,505 --> 00:12:48,846
Allahabad, Konpur, Lucknow.

80
00:12:51,409 --> 00:12:54,098
Me too, I like music.

81
00:12:54,318 --> 00:12:57,889
I attended musical
parties there.

82
00:12:58,101 --> 00:13:02,056
I can play the percussion,
if necessary.

83
00:13:05,731 --> 00:13:06,877
You can go.

84
00:13:07,097 --> 00:13:08,279
Go?

85
00:13:18,529 --> 00:13:20,273
Will Durgabai come?

86
00:13:21,156 --> 00:13:23,187
Invitation cards have been sent?

87
00:13:23,363 --> 00:13:25,525
Yes, the usual ones.

88
00:13:25,746 --> 00:13:26,784
To Mahim too.

89
00:13:27,007 --> 00:13:29,169
At your service... but...

90
00:13:29,775 --> 00:13:34,744
Usurer's money can't
be used to pay

91
00:13:34,925 --> 00:13:36,920
the initiation ceremony
of my only son.

92
00:13:37,132 --> 00:13:39,474
- Do you have another choice?
- Yes.

93
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:45,496
The jewels of the Roy family
are still in the safe.

94
00:19:38,224 --> 00:19:39,860
What's happening?

95
00:19:41,343 --> 00:19:43,087
Are you angry?

96
00:19:47,859 --> 00:19:50,379
There's nothing left now.

97
00:19:51,994 --> 00:19:53,428
Yes, my jewels.

98
00:19:55,287 --> 00:19:57,067
Your jewels?

99
00:19:59,631 --> 00:20:03,442
They're mortgaged
but I'll buy them back.

100
00:20:06,008 --> 00:20:09,962
Old fool, do you know the cost
of your last musical party?

101
00:20:11,789 --> 00:20:13,007
The cost?

102
00:20:14,767 --> 00:20:17,527
We have to spend money.

103
00:20:18,235 --> 00:20:22,117
Khoka is my only son.

104
00:20:26,329 --> 00:20:30,319
Am I going to cut down
on his sacred initiation?

105
00:20:30,533 --> 00:20:32,600
My prestige depends on it.

106
00:20:34,352 --> 00:20:37,183
But... mortgaging in
order to pay the singer!

107
00:20:43,111 --> 00:20:46,539
This girl is exceptional.

108
00:20:47,806 --> 00:20:52,179
Her beauty, her voice...

109
00:20:52,746 --> 00:20:54,908
you'll know when you
listen to her.

110
00:20:56,635 --> 00:20:58,379
No, I won't.

111
00:21:08,092 --> 00:21:09,454
Where are you going?

112
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:14,352
It's 3. I'm going to bed.
Khoka sleeps alone.

113
00:21:14,574 --> 00:21:16,460
Stay a while.

114
00:21:25,925 --> 00:21:27,143
What is it?

115
00:21:33,493 --> 00:21:35,834
What's the problem?

116
00:21:38,153 --> 00:21:40,111
Close the music room.

117
00:21:40,324 --> 00:21:41,542
Why?

118
00:21:42,357 --> 00:21:44,699
I'll be deprived of music.

119
00:21:44,914 --> 00:21:47,745
Music.
A crazy passion of yours.

120
00:21:48,418 --> 00:21:51,500
That becomes one
of your son too.

121
00:21:51,676 --> 00:21:56,359
He neglects his work because
of music, only but music.

122
00:21:56,546 --> 00:21:59,903
And now he wants to ride.

123
00:22:00,085 --> 00:22:02,951
Why do you worry?

124
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:08,096
He'll ride Tufan.

125
00:22:08,318 --> 00:22:12,726
He'll hunt on Mati.

126
00:22:13,188 --> 00:22:17,144
If not, how could he be
a landowner from Roy lineage?

127
00:22:17,323 --> 00:22:20,824
Landowner? What's left?

128
00:22:21,038 --> 00:22:22,819
Everything has been swept away.

129
00:22:24,999 --> 00:22:28,142
Haven't you seen the
work of the river?

130
00:22:29,205 --> 00:22:33,997
The pretty garden has been
carried away the other day.

131
00:22:34,216 --> 00:22:35,997
The flood?

132
00:22:36,214 --> 00:22:37,230
Already forgotten?

133
00:22:39,018 --> 00:22:42,627
I opened the doors of the
Roy house that day.

134
00:22:42,838 --> 00:22:46,410
One thousand people
took refuge there.

135
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:52,044
I have also many virtues.

136
00:22:53,528 --> 00:22:57,483
I know. I am anxious.

137
00:22:57,699 --> 00:22:59,479
A nightmare, last night...

138
00:23:01,764 --> 00:23:04,739
Do you know my dream?

139
00:23:05,129 --> 00:23:08,414
In a nymph music room,

140
00:23:08,598 --> 00:23:11,012
there is a big party.

141
00:23:11,858 --> 00:23:17,427
Rambha sings, Urbashi dances...

142
00:23:18,166 --> 00:23:20,472
...and Menaka...

143
00:26:27,665 --> 00:26:29,170
That's enough.

144
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:36,248
It's very late. Go to bed.

145
00:26:37,759 --> 00:26:39,431
Will we go to Narayanpur?

146
00:26:39,652 --> 00:26:41,850
We'll talk about it later.
Go to bed.

147
00:26:42,946 --> 00:26:44,308
Where do you want to go?

148
00:26:44,523 --> 00:26:46,411
Mother wrote.

149
00:26:46,836 --> 00:26:48,270
Oh! Narayanpur...

150
00:26:48,483 --> 00:26:51,208
Father is very sick.
Mother would like...

151
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:54,400
You can go.

152
00:26:55,423 --> 00:26:57,419
I consider bringing Khoka.

153
00:26:57,631 --> 00:26:58,814
Good.

154
00:26:59,033 --> 00:26:59,798
And you?

155
00:27:01,486 --> 00:27:03,195
Me? Why should I go?

156
00:27:03,694 --> 00:27:08,354
I'm afraid to leave you alone.
With your crazy ideas...

157
00:27:09,512 --> 00:27:14,196
Let's go there together.
There isn't much work now.

158
00:27:14,419 --> 00:27:18,613
That's absurd.
Who will watch the land?

159
00:27:18,835 --> 00:27:19,946
Who?

160
00:27:24,933 --> 00:27:28,219
You! Watching the land?

161
00:27:29,384 --> 00:27:32,036
Be serious...

162
00:27:33,309 --> 00:27:35,125
Come with us.

163
00:27:37,865 --> 00:27:41,498
Do you agree, if not...

164
00:27:43,964 --> 00:27:46,724
Don't be insistent.
We'll talk about it.

165
00:27:47,187 --> 00:27:49,255
You exaggerate.

166
00:28:06,349 --> 00:28:07,221
Goodbye.

167
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:10,721
Say "see you soon"
rather than "goodbye".

168
00:28:13,955 --> 00:28:16,894
Be good and behave.

169
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:42,089
Behave.

170
00:30:49,762 --> 00:30:51,450
What do we hear?

171
00:30:51,777 --> 00:30:53,215
A generator.

172
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:54,905
A generator?

173
00:30:56,473 --> 00:30:58,008
Where?

174
00:30:58,525 --> 00:31:03,095
At Ganguli's place. From the
terrace, we see the light.

175
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:04,961
At Mahim's?

176
00:31:08,766 --> 00:31:13,127
He's been said to have bought
some English furniture.

177
00:31:19,532 --> 00:31:22,867
Do you want me to play again?

178
00:33:22,894 --> 00:33:26,180
Did you see the new house
of Ganguli?

179
00:33:27,696 --> 00:33:29,405
What do you think of it?

180
00:33:34,214 --> 00:33:38,588
Quite modern. Not as prestigious
as your palace.

181
00:33:39,191 --> 00:33:42,477
No music room, no fountain.

182
00:33:43,362 --> 00:33:48,859
No garden, no temple, nothing.

183
00:34:02,147 --> 00:34:06,485
Next monday, Beggars' Day
at Ganguli's.

184
00:34:19,651 --> 00:34:21,503
Mahim wishes to see you.

185
00:34:25,854 --> 00:34:27,455
Tell him to come in.

186
00:34:45,341 --> 00:34:47,013
Come in Mahim.

187
00:34:54,103 --> 00:34:58,261
You must visit
my house, Master.

188
00:35:04,688 --> 00:35:08,117
I repeat, would you honour
me with your visit?

189
00:35:08,297 --> 00:35:10,424
On which occasion?

190
00:35:11,031 --> 00:35:14,735
With your blessing, I have
built a house.

191
00:35:14,956 --> 00:35:18,134
The inauguration is on Monday,
Bengali New Year's Day.

192
00:35:19,337 --> 00:35:21,153
New Year's Day?

193
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:25,428
I already have a party at home.

194
00:35:26,417 --> 00:35:27,037
On the first?

195
00:35:27,258 --> 00:35:28,548
Yes, the lucky day.

196
00:35:28,975 --> 00:35:30,301
The lucky day party?

197
00:35:31,288 --> 00:35:34,611
I have never...

198
00:35:35,984 --> 00:35:40,669
If you insist,
I can put it off.

199
00:35:42,083 --> 00:35:43,970
Will that help?

200
00:35:44,186 --> 00:35:46,253
No, no. It's not necessary.

201
00:35:46,464 --> 00:35:50,169
You're the Master,
and we are...

202
00:35:50,389 --> 00:35:51,930
Your plans first.

203
00:35:52,141 --> 00:35:54,758
I can't do anything, you know.

204
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:59,175
Everything is already planned.

205
00:36:04,092 --> 00:36:07,342
Please allow me to leave now.

206
00:36:07,562 --> 00:36:09,796
Agreed. Good day.

207
00:36:22,527 --> 00:36:23,364
Did you hear?

208
00:36:27,153 --> 00:36:28,407
And the jewels?

209
00:36:29,537 --> 00:36:32,129
It's the last box.

210
00:36:33,498 --> 00:36:34,860
The last one?

211
00:36:36,581 --> 00:36:41,206
How dare you say "last"
with this trivial tone...

212
00:36:41,418 --> 00:36:42,673
Nothing is final.

213
00:36:45,308 --> 00:36:47,829
Prepare everything.

214
00:36:48,042 --> 00:36:50,276
Don't count money.

215
00:36:51,477 --> 00:36:55,635
And this old musician?

216
00:36:55,858 --> 00:36:59,108
What's his name?
The man from Murshidabad.

217
00:36:59,327 --> 00:37:00,892
Ujir Khan, Master.

218
00:37:01,255 --> 00:37:04,373
Go and fetch him.
He'll play a recital.

219
00:37:09,071 --> 00:37:13,098
Send a messenger to Narayanpur.

220
00:37:13,276 --> 00:37:15,869
Her Lordship and Khoka

221
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:20,238
must be back on the morning
of the first.

222
00:38:07,794 --> 00:38:12,902
Everything's ready for lucky day.
The guests are arriving.

223
00:38:28,542 --> 00:38:31,027
The boat is not back yet.

224
00:38:31,696 --> 00:38:35,268
Must I send two others?
The storm looks threatening.

225
00:38:37,619 --> 00:38:40,271
Go if you want.
I'll join you.

226
00:46:30,549 --> 00:46:33,632
Is the boat back?

227
00:46:35,981 --> 00:46:37,450
What's happened?

228
00:46:39,451 --> 00:46:40,992
Drawn into a whirlpool.

229
00:46:41,203 --> 00:46:42,493
What do you say?

230
00:46:43,972 --> 00:46:46,911
Into a whirlpool?
Who told you that?

231
00:46:47,126 --> 00:46:48,202
Kali is back.

232
00:46:48,388 --> 00:46:51,889
Only Kali?
Who else? Nobody?

233
00:46:52,103 --> 00:46:53,883
Speak! Nobody else?

234
00:46:54,066 --> 00:46:55,177
The young Prince...

235
00:46:55,398 --> 00:46:57,883
Khoka is back? Khoka!

236
00:49:10,802 --> 00:49:12,403
You're still here?

237
00:49:12,589 --> 00:49:14,190
Yes, Master.

238
00:49:15,008 --> 00:49:16,298
Why?

239
00:49:19,073 --> 00:49:21,856
What will happen
if we all leave?

240
00:49:23,399 --> 00:49:25,481
Nothing.

241
00:49:26,992 --> 00:49:29,215
It's all over.

242
00:49:30,690 --> 00:49:32,842
It wouldn't have happened...

243
00:49:33,062 --> 00:49:36,820
if you had paid more attention.
Because the land...

244
00:49:37,039 --> 00:49:38,323
The land!

245
00:49:41,155 --> 00:49:43,034
Where is it?

246
00:49:43,772 --> 00:49:46,412
Everything is under water,

247
00:49:47,713 --> 00:49:52,067
under deep water.
Devastated...

248
00:49:53,818 --> 00:49:56,221
Everything has been devastated.

249
00:50:03,377 --> 00:50:05,815
The Privy Council
has given its verdict,

250
00:50:06,028 --> 00:50:09,823
everything is lost
except the sacred land.

251
00:50:10,284 --> 00:50:12,960
Would Your Honour
please come downstairs?

252
00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:15,963
Furniture must be sold.

253
00:50:23,889 --> 00:50:25,518
Please...

254
00:50:29,471 --> 00:50:32,575
I will never come
downstairs again.

255
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:37,388
Do whatever is best.

256
00:50:39,552 --> 00:50:40,694
Listen.

257
00:50:46,215 --> 00:50:50,819
Are Mati and Tufan still here?

258
00:50:51,484 --> 00:50:53,362
Yes, Lord. They're here.

259
00:50:53,577 --> 00:50:58,108
The Royal house of Sundarpur
has made an offer,

260
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:00,997
but we were waiting
for your order.

261
00:51:03,797 --> 00:51:06,902
They will stay...

262
00:51:07,391 --> 00:51:09,864
My Khoka's favorites.

263
00:51:13,775 --> 00:51:16,069
The musician is downstairs,

264
00:51:16,461 --> 00:51:19,350
should I call him?
Do you want to hear him?

265
00:51:26,159 --> 00:51:28,037
Send him back.

266
00:51:29,298 --> 00:51:32,331
No more music for me.

267
00:51:56,613 --> 00:51:58,980
And your syrup?

268
00:52:03,939 --> 00:52:06,198
Tomorrow I'll go downstairs.

269
00:52:06,415 --> 00:52:07,628
You'll go downstairs?

270
00:52:08,404 --> 00:52:11,818
I want to see Tufan and Mati.

271
00:52:12,032 --> 00:52:13,911
You mean right now, Lord?

272
00:52:14,613 --> 00:52:17,087
You go first and you warn them.

273
00:54:15,711 --> 00:54:16,722
How are you doing?

274
00:54:17,175 --> 00:54:22,469
The horse is sad because
you don't ride him anymore.

275
00:54:24,571 --> 00:54:26,974
Does he eat his chickpeas?

276
00:56:04,432 --> 00:56:07,012
Has the elephant still
his caparison?

277
00:56:07,188 --> 00:56:09,031
I'm going to ask... Ahmad.

278
00:56:09,246 --> 00:56:13,456
Tell him to embellish him.

279
00:56:13,677 --> 00:56:16,389
To go... to Ganguli's house.

280
00:56:20,898 --> 00:56:23,824
Send for the steward too.

281
00:56:47,968 --> 00:56:50,406
I have asked them to adorn Mati.

282
00:56:50,620 --> 00:56:54,140
Put this golden coin
on a silver plate

283
00:56:54,352 --> 00:56:59,122
and bring it to Mahim's,
following the custom.

284
00:57:08,795 --> 00:57:10,186
What are you waiting for?

285
00:57:10,364 --> 00:57:13,956
There is no more
silver plate, Lord.

286
00:57:16,958 --> 00:57:18,171
So take a copper one.

287
00:57:18,388 --> 00:57:19,922
Yes, Lord.

288
00:57:20,132 --> 00:57:21,796
That will do.

289
00:57:38,900 --> 00:57:41,088
Close all the curtains.

290
00:59:06,326 --> 00:59:07,682
Porter!

291
00:59:17,594 --> 00:59:18,842
Servant!

292
00:59:31,164 --> 00:59:32,936
You're here, steward!

293
00:59:33,152 --> 00:59:35,900
Are you all dismissed?

294
00:59:36,117 --> 00:59:40,958
Is there someone left
to announce me?

295
00:59:42,257 --> 00:59:43,399
It's for a meeting.

296
00:59:43,618 --> 00:59:45,116
A business one?

297
00:59:46,025 --> 00:59:49,748
I'd rather talk to him directly.

298
01:00:43,966 --> 01:00:46,333
Could you wait a moment?

299
01:00:50,316 --> 01:00:52,718
This residence...
What a splendour!

300
01:00:52,897 --> 01:00:54,598
Long ago, but now...

301
01:00:57,571 --> 01:01:01,746
After all, even a dead elephant
is still worth 100.000 RS.

302
01:01:01,967 --> 01:01:03,179
What do you say about it?

303
01:01:05,839 --> 01:01:10,965
When you came this morning to
my house on this old elephant...

304
01:01:11,177 --> 01:01:13,055
people greeted him

305
01:01:13,479 --> 01:01:15,702
whereas they stoned and

306
01:01:15,885 --> 01:01:19,501
scratched my new car.

307
01:01:19,723 --> 01:01:21,424
I was driving myself!

308
01:01:21,642 --> 01:01:23,592
The Master is calling you.

309
01:01:23,805 --> 01:01:26,064
And you know why?

310
01:01:28,166 --> 01:01:31,330
Because I have no pedigree,
I'm a self-made man.

311
01:01:40,271 --> 01:01:44,410
Grandpa, you have turned
my invitation down!

312
01:01:44,875 --> 01:01:48,324
Well... sit down.

313
01:01:51,817 --> 01:01:55,087
I was wrong. I was so busy...

314
01:01:55,306 --> 01:01:57,637
I wasrt able to come
in person to ask you...

315
01:01:59,527 --> 01:02:02,976
No, no, it's nothing but...

316
01:02:03,434 --> 01:02:09,119
I can't change my habits
...my age.

317
01:02:09,922 --> 01:02:12,812
Come on Grandpa,
don't talk about your age...

318
01:02:13,027 --> 01:02:14,977
I saw you riding a horse.

319
01:02:16,376 --> 01:02:19,504
No Mahim, this time is gone!

320
01:02:20,144 --> 01:02:23,272
I've grown so old since 4 years.

321
01:02:23,911 --> 01:02:26,456
That explains that cane
in your hands.

322
01:02:28,342 --> 01:02:30,530
Whatever, tonight

323
01:02:30,714 --> 01:02:35,209
you must honour my house
with your noble presence.

324
01:02:36,121 --> 01:02:37,024
Tonight?

325
01:02:39,191 --> 01:02:43,509
Yes, tonight. My music room
is inaugurated.

326
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:46,787
Do you know Krishnabai?
From Lucknow.

327
01:02:50,354 --> 01:02:53,066
No? Everybody's talking
about her.

328
01:02:53,284 --> 01:02:56,899
It's said at her age...
that dance called...

329
01:02:57,889 --> 01:02:58,864
Kathak...

330
01:02:59,075 --> 01:03:00,740
No one is better than her.

331
01:03:00,925 --> 01:03:01,542
Really?

332
01:03:03,087 --> 01:03:07,785
Krishnabai's dancing,
and the best drum...

333
01:03:08,355 --> 01:03:11,388
Who could appreciate
that as we do?

334
01:03:12,052 --> 01:03:15,215
My car will wait for you

335
01:03:15,436 --> 01:03:17,065
tonight around 8.

336
01:03:18,053 --> 01:03:19,195
No, brother, thank you.

337
01:03:19,413 --> 01:03:20,555
Why not?

338
01:03:23,808 --> 01:03:27,746
I don't want to go out
at the moment.

339
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:29,352
Even for a concert?

340
01:03:30,437 --> 01:03:33,077
So you won't come?

341
01:03:33,262 --> 01:03:34,891
No thank you.

342
01:03:37,763 --> 01:03:39,820
Allow me to leave then.

343
01:03:40,937 --> 01:03:42,530
But your syrup?

344
01:03:42,751 --> 01:03:46,235
My syrup! I forgot.

345
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:07,717
Goodbye.

346
01:04:07,938 --> 01:04:11,696
I have to rush to town.
English officials will come...

347
01:05:57,637 --> 01:05:59,825
The music room is closed?

348
01:06:00,043 --> 01:06:02,517
Yes, since the other day.

349
01:06:02,729 --> 01:06:03,835
Where is the key?

350
01:06:04,055 --> 01:06:05,756
The steward got it.

351
01:06:08,765 --> 01:06:10,228
Open it.

352
01:06:25,489 --> 01:06:27,748
I bring a lamp.

353
01:11:14,719 --> 01:11:16,836
What is Krishnabai's fee?

354
01:11:24,939 --> 01:11:26,117
200, Lord!

355
01:11:26,998 --> 01:11:29,966
How much money is left?

356
01:11:32,626 --> 01:11:33,912
How much?

357
01:11:36,296 --> 01:11:39,406
From the sacred land.

358
01:11:50,908 --> 01:11:52,934
Tomorrow I give a concert.

359
01:11:53,704 --> 01:11:56,004
I must get Krishnabai!

360
01:12:02,704 --> 01:12:05,112
Impossible, Lord!

361
01:12:19,273 --> 01:12:20,810
What did you say?

362
01:12:20,986 --> 01:12:24,514
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

363
01:13:22,548 --> 01:13:23,692
Everything's ready?

364
01:13:23,912 --> 01:13:25,544
Except for some shopping.

365
01:13:25,764 --> 01:13:26,276
Which ones?

366
01:13:26,462 --> 01:13:28,274
Perfumes, candles...

367
01:13:28,491 --> 01:13:31,076
Everything to honour my guests.

368
01:13:31,252 --> 01:13:32,361
Any drinks?

369
01:13:34,119 --> 01:13:37,992
Send Rahamat right away.
Let him ride Tufan.

370
01:14:45,038 --> 01:14:48,077
Ganguli Babu has just
arrived, Lord.

371
01:15:26,111 --> 01:15:27,743
Sit down, Mahim.

372
01:15:28,138 --> 01:15:32,047
Tell me what will happen.

373
01:15:32,228 --> 01:15:33,658
Why?

374
01:15:35,514 --> 01:15:40,436
Well... the atmosphere
is strange.

375
01:17:00,581 --> 01:17:03,060
I said: Is there someone...

376
01:17:04,111 --> 01:17:06,138
to fan us?

377
01:17:58,530 --> 01:18:01,767
Here you go, Grandpa.
How are you?

378
01:22:25,631 --> 01:22:27,967
Are you satisfied?

379
01:26:57,401 --> 01:27:01,096
Hoorah for the dancer!

380
01:27:14,775 --> 01:27:20,330
The host reserves the right
of the first gift.

381
01:27:50,185 --> 01:27:53,355
He failed.
He couldn't do it.

382
01:28:43,408 --> 01:28:45,040
He couldn't do it.
He couldn't do it.

383
01:28:48,232 --> 01:28:51,200
That usurer's son!

384
01:28:52,288 --> 01:28:54,838
He wanted to break the top.

385
01:28:55,049 --> 01:28:56,967
Such an arrogance!

386
01:29:01,096 --> 01:29:03,992
He tries to reach the stars...

387
01:29:05,605 --> 01:29:08,119
In vain, in vain.

388
01:29:14,519 --> 01:29:17,069
Do you know why he fails?

389
01:29:24,412 --> 01:29:25,842
Blood!

390
01:29:28,116 --> 01:29:31,227
Blood in my veins.

391
01:29:34,479 --> 01:29:38,137
Do you know which blood
flows in my veins?

392
01:29:38,324 --> 01:29:39,611
Which one, Master?

393
01:29:39,792 --> 01:29:42,378
You want to see?
You really want to?

394
01:29:42,588 --> 01:29:44,018
Come here, come.

395
01:29:52,026 --> 01:29:54,780
Look at my father.

396
01:29:55,488 --> 01:29:58,383
Ramerswar.

397
01:30:03,493 --> 01:30:05,936
My grandfather.

398
01:30:12,371 --> 01:30:14,850
My great-grandfather.

399
01:30:15,238 --> 01:30:17,752
Tarakesvar.

400
01:30:19,501 --> 01:30:22,433
My great-great-grandfather.

401
01:30:22,647 --> 01:30:25,507
Ravanesvar.

402
01:30:34,638 --> 01:30:35,817
To you!

403
01:30:37,329 --> 01:30:40,821
To you, noble ancestors!
To you!

404
01:31:18,347 --> 01:31:19,418
And to you...

405
01:31:20,609 --> 01:31:23,336
...my noble self.

406
01:34:29,219 --> 01:34:30,398
All gone.

407
01:34:30,617 --> 01:34:31,726
Gone?

408
01:34:31,946 --> 01:34:34,245
Yes, all of them.

409
01:34:34,462 --> 01:34:36,548
The lights too, Master.

410
01:34:37,503 --> 01:34:39,803
Yes, the lights...

411
01:34:40,720 --> 01:34:45,082
The candles are consumed,
Lord. It's dawn.

412
01:34:45,299 --> 01:34:48,469
The sun is about to rise.

413
01:34:48,690 --> 01:34:50,395
The sun is rising?

414
01:34:50,612 --> 01:34:53,127
I'll open the curtains.

415
01:35:33,818 --> 01:35:34,962
Tufan is calling me.

416
01:35:39,691 --> 01:35:41,644
You can't, Lord, no.

417
01:35:41,822 --> 01:35:43,252
My riding habit.

418
01:35:44,479 --> 01:35:45,945
You can't.

419
01:35:52,309 --> 01:35:53,668
My riding crop.

420
01:36:13,248 --> 01:36:14,225
You let him go?

421
01:36:14,436 --> 01:36:16,522
I begged him, but he refused.

422
01:36:16,743 --> 01:36:17,958
God help us!

423
01:37:43,714 --> 01:37:44,512
Blood!

424
01:38:38,734 --> 01:38:41,560
The End
