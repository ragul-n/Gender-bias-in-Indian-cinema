1
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:04,935
I'm definitely putting
Middlebury on my list.

2
00:00:04,936 --> 00:00:07,237
Vermont is really cold in the winter.

3
00:00:07,238 --> 00:00:09,322
Which is why I also have UCLA on here.

4
00:00:09,323 --> 00:00:10,356
Hollywood, baby.

5
00:00:10,357 --> 00:00:11,658
For the first of,

6
00:00:11,659 --> 00:00:14,828
I'm sure many times over
the next couple of years,

7
00:00:14,829 --> 00:00:18,915
I have to ask, what is wrong with UVA?

8
00:00:18,916 --> 00:00:20,500
Yeah, you are a legacy... twice.

9
00:00:20,501 --> 00:00:23,670
Yeah, I got my degree and
met the love of my life.

10
00:00:23,671 --> 00:00:26,213
- See? Greatest twofer ever.
- Mm-hmm.

11
00:00:26,214 --> 00:00:27,625
You should consider Georgetown.

12
00:00:27,626 --> 00:00:28,733
I'm really happy there.

13
00:00:28,734 --> 00:00:30,376
Okay, thank you, McCords,

14
00:00:30,377 --> 00:00:33,129
but I would like to go out of
state and blaze a new trail.

15
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:35,521
I know, but do you have to blaze

16
00:00:35,522 --> 00:00:37,133
all the way to California?

17
00:00:37,134 --> 00:00:38,768
Yeah. Hey, Jason,

18
00:00:38,769 --> 00:00:39,803
you'll consider UVA, right?

19
00:00:39,804 --> 00:00:41,438
We need another Wahoo in the family.

20
00:00:42,807 --> 00:00:45,308
Okay, the nickname itself is
reason to cross it off the list.

21
00:00:45,309 --> 00:00:46,860
I'm not going to college, so...

22
00:00:46,861 --> 00:00:49,795
And may I ask why?

23
00:00:50,815 --> 00:00:54,150
Academia's a shell game
that only rich kids can win.

24
00:00:54,151 --> 00:00:55,985
It's a student debt factory

25
00:00:55,986 --> 00:00:57,654
that imparts no real wisdom or skills.

26
00:00:57,655 --> 00:00:58,571
It's a racket.

27
00:00:58,572 --> 00:01:00,623
That's what I thought, too,

28
00:01:00,624 --> 00:01:02,792
until I actually got out in the real world.

29
00:01:02,793 --> 00:01:05,078
We already have a college
fund all set aside.

30
00:01:05,079 --> 00:01:08,164
College expenses will
outpace anything you've saved.

31
00:01:08,165 --> 00:01:09,883
Do you really want to
mortgage your retirement

32
00:01:09,884 --> 00:01:12,502
so I can extend my childhood for four years

33
00:01:12,503 --> 00:01:14,754
going to keggers and pledging a frat?

34
00:01:14,755 --> 00:01:16,339
- Now, that's a good point.
- When you put it that way.

35
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:18,675
- How much is in the college fund?
- A lot.

36
00:01:18,676 --> 00:01:20,093
- Enough so that we could sail
around the world? - Heck yeah.

37
00:01:20,094 --> 00:01:21,427
Because I've always wanted
to see the Galapagos Islands.

38
00:01:21,428 --> 00:01:22,562
Yeah, heck, we could go on...

39
00:01:22,563 --> 00:01:23,813
- You're making fun of me.
- A little bit.

40
00:01:23,814 --> 00:01:25,148
You know what? I don't have to

41
00:01:25,149 --> 00:01:26,266
take advice from you, Professor.

42
00:01:26,267 --> 00:01:29,352
First, you were a puppet for big business,

43
00:01:29,353 --> 00:01:32,355
and now you're working for the
military-industrial complex.

44
00:01:32,356 --> 00:01:34,089
How's that for a twofer?

45
00:01:37,745 --> 00:01:39,946
Well, on the upside, if
he does change his mind,

46
00:01:39,947 --> 00:01:42,965
I think he's landed on a great
topic for his application essay.

47
00:01:46,514 --> 00:01:47,728
Oh, don't tell me.

48
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:49,756
Is that the famous East
Africa corruption report?

49
00:01:49,757 --> 00:01:50,790
The one and only.

50
00:01:50,791 --> 00:01:51,758
It's finally finished?

51
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,126
Well, it's finally printed out.

52
00:01:53,127 --> 00:01:57,046
454 pages of raw excitement.

53
00:01:57,047 --> 00:01:58,515
We've run the most recent changes

54
00:01:58,516 --> 00:02:00,884
by Treasury, Commerce and the CIA.

55
00:02:00,885 --> 00:02:03,720
All that's left is for the
White House to sign off.

56
00:02:03,721 --> 00:02:05,271
You know, these interdepartmental

57
00:02:05,272 --> 00:02:07,273
task forces seem like a good idea,

58
00:02:07,274 --> 00:02:09,142
until you realize how many people

59
00:02:09,143 --> 00:02:11,895
need to approve of it
before you're finished.

60
00:02:11,896 --> 00:02:13,146
Oh, I ordered pizza

61
00:02:13,147 --> 00:02:15,064
from Romano's last night,

62
00:02:15,065 --> 00:02:17,829
the delivery guy is
concerned about our reliance

63
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:19,869
on anti-corruption agencies.

64
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:22,455
I have concerns about their
crust being too doughy.

65
00:02:22,456 --> 00:02:25,208
Does this report have a title yet?

66
00:02:25,209 --> 00:02:27,827
"Corruption in East Africa
and its Negative Impact

67
00:02:27,828 --> 00:02:30,163
on U.S. Competitive
Advantage in the Region."

68
00:02:30,164 --> 00:02:31,748
That's catchy.

69
00:02:31,749 --> 00:02:35,218
See, I wanted, "China Wins
Because They Bribe Everyone,"

70
00:02:35,219 --> 00:02:36,920
but Treasury shot me down.

71
00:02:36,921 --> 00:02:39,923
Ma'am. I have Henry on the phone.

72
00:02:39,924 --> 00:02:41,641
He says it's about his father.

73
00:02:41,642 --> 00:02:43,760
It's important.

74
00:02:43,761 --> 00:02:45,494
Okay, thank you.

75
00:02:49,433 --> 00:02:53,368
Baby, I'm so sorry.

76
00:02:54,188 --> 00:02:56,155
What happened?

77
00:02:56,156 --> 00:03:00,076
I mean, the last time we
saw him, he-he seemed fine.

78
00:03:00,077 --> 00:03:01,578
Maureen found him this morning.

79
00:03:01,579 --> 00:03:04,614
At first she thought he just overslept.

80
00:03:04,615 --> 00:03:06,616
He must have died during the night.

81
00:03:06,617 --> 00:03:08,952
Probably a heart attack.

82
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,672
He always said he wanted
to die in his sleep...

83
00:03:12,673 --> 00:03:14,207
quick and painless.

84
00:03:14,208 --> 00:03:16,459
Yeah, but not yet.

85
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:18,628
He was too young.

86
00:03:18,629 --> 00:03:20,680
He called me about a week ago.

87
00:03:20,681 --> 00:03:22,215
Just to catch up.

88
00:03:22,216 --> 00:03:25,400
Had a nice long talk.

89
00:03:28,973 --> 00:03:30,822
I'm grateful for that.

90
00:03:57,801 --> 00:03:59,085
Oh, look at you.

91
00:03:59,086 --> 00:04:00,637
Come here.

92
00:04:00,638 --> 00:04:02,771
Hey, Aunt Maureen.

93
00:04:04,341 --> 00:04:05,975
Good to see you, Elizabeth.

94
00:04:05,976 --> 00:04:07,010
Maureen, nice to see you.

95
00:04:07,011 --> 00:04:08,928
- I'm so sorry about Patrick.
- Thanks.

96
00:04:08,929 --> 00:04:10,346
Ah, it's been a rough morning,

97
00:04:10,347 --> 00:04:13,349
but you're a bright spot in a terrible day.

98
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:15,500
Oh.

99
00:04:16,403 --> 00:04:17,904
Three SUVs, huh?

100
00:04:17,905 --> 00:04:19,522
I'll have to tell the mourners

101
00:04:19,523 --> 00:04:21,024
that parking is at a premium.

102
00:04:21,025 --> 00:04:23,109
Security protocol.

103
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:25,460
You know, in case someone
wants to shoot her.

104
00:04:26,196 --> 00:04:28,915
Come on, kids, help me out, would you?

105
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:31,284
Thanks, kid. Good to see you.

106
00:04:31,285 --> 00:04:33,301
All right.

107
00:04:34,038 --> 00:04:35,538
Can I get anybody anything?

108
00:04:35,539 --> 00:04:37,540
Oh, we're good, thanks.

109
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:39,175
Kids, I can make sandwiches.

110
00:04:39,176 --> 00:04:41,210
We actually ate on the road.

111
00:04:41,211 --> 00:04:42,962
Maureen, will you come and sit down?

112
00:04:42,963 --> 00:04:44,729
You're just making everybody nervous.

113
00:04:46,133 --> 00:04:47,383
Dad, can we go watch TV?

114
00:04:47,384 --> 00:04:48,718
- Sure thing.
- No.

115
00:04:48,719 --> 00:04:49,719
Please?

116
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,720
It's family time.

117
00:04:50,721 --> 00:04:52,821
They can be a family in the den.

118
00:04:57,611 --> 00:05:00,196
Erin, if you finally decide
to have kids of your own,

119
00:05:00,197 --> 00:05:01,564
you may find there's more to it

120
00:05:01,565 --> 00:05:03,316
than giving in to them all the time.

121
00:05:03,317 --> 00:05:05,318
I teach history to high schoolers.

122
00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:07,904
I'm an expert in knowing when
a teenager needs to get up

123
00:05:07,905 --> 00:05:09,655
and get the heck out of the room.

124
00:05:09,656 --> 00:05:10,573
Okay, go.

125
00:05:10,574 --> 00:05:11,708
Go, you guys. Go ahead.

126
00:05:11,709 --> 00:05:13,076
Um, I think I'm gonna take a walk.

127
00:05:13,077 --> 00:05:14,577
I'll come with you.

128
00:05:14,578 --> 00:05:16,579
Dad, I'll see you back at your place.

129
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:17,580
Later.

130
00:05:17,581 --> 00:05:20,049
Well, now the grown-ups can talk freely.

131
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:21,384
Henry and Elizabeth

132
00:05:21,385 --> 00:05:23,002
haven't heard your news.

133
00:05:23,003 --> 00:05:26,556
Oh, yeah. Um, me and Stacy are separated.

134
00:05:26,557 --> 00:05:29,008
Oh, gosh, Shane, I'm sorry to hear that.

135
00:05:29,009 --> 00:05:30,176
I really liked her.

136
00:05:30,177 --> 00:05:32,595
Me, too. We just jumped in too fast.

137
00:05:32,596 --> 00:05:33,763
Oh, that's what happens

138
00:05:33,764 --> 00:05:35,181
when you get married before the ink

139
00:05:35,182 --> 00:05:36,948
on your last divorce is even dry.

140
00:05:40,738 --> 00:05:43,156
Wait, who's this? I don't recognize her.

141
00:05:43,157 --> 00:05:45,742
That's Debra, Dad's new girlfriend.

142
00:05:45,743 --> 00:05:48,911
Wow. On the mantel. It must be serious.

143
00:05:48,912 --> 00:05:50,246
Oh, I wouldn't know.

144
00:05:50,247 --> 00:05:52,915
I didn't like to talk to
him about his lady friends.

145
00:05:52,916 --> 00:05:54,417
Not with Mom so recently gone.

146
00:05:54,418 --> 00:05:56,419
Maureen, Mom's been dead for four years.

147
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:58,121
Well, I still feel her
presence in this house.

148
00:05:58,122 --> 00:06:00,757
Now they're together in heaven.

149
00:06:00,758 --> 00:06:03,009
Want to bet the old man's up there

150
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:05,044
giving St. Peter a piece of his mind?

151
00:06:05,045 --> 00:06:07,380
Demanding better
conditions and overtime pay

152
00:06:07,381 --> 00:06:09,132
for those hardworking angels.

153
00:06:10,384 --> 00:06:12,802
Well, maybe we should try
and get in touch with her.

154
00:06:12,803 --> 00:06:14,470
Well, if by we, you mean me,

155
00:06:14,471 --> 00:06:16,439
I have got enough on my plate, thank you.

156
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,474
Maureen, Henry and I can definitely help.

157
00:06:18,475 --> 00:06:19,642
What do you need?

158
00:06:19,643 --> 00:06:20,810
Um...

159
00:06:20,811 --> 00:06:22,979
there's the obituary to write,

160
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:24,697
and, uh, I have an appointment tomorrow

161
00:06:24,698 --> 00:06:26,783
at O'Flynn and Sons to
prepare for the service.

162
00:06:26,784 --> 00:06:27,950
I can go with you to that.

163
00:06:27,951 --> 00:06:30,036
Somebody needs to go to the precinct today

164
00:06:30,037 --> 00:06:31,070
to sign the paperwork.

165
00:06:31,071 --> 00:06:32,238
I can take care of that.

166
00:06:32,239 --> 00:06:34,490
Oh, it's Detective Michael Swanstrom.

167
00:06:34,491 --> 00:06:35,958
He was here this morning.

168
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:37,293
He knew Dad from church.

169
00:06:37,294 --> 00:06:39,045
Of course, Dad hadn't been in a while.

170
00:06:39,046 --> 00:06:40,329
He only went to make Mom happy.

171
00:06:41,331 --> 00:06:43,082
So, do you want me to pick up dinner?

172
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:45,551
God, no. People are already
dropping off casseroles.

173
00:06:45,552 --> 00:06:47,170
We'll have more food than
we know what to do with.

174
00:06:47,171 --> 00:06:49,164
I'll help you clean out the
fridge, make some more room.

175
00:06:49,165 --> 00:06:51,174
- Oh, Elizabeth, would you do me a favor?
- Sure.

176
00:06:51,175 --> 00:06:53,843
Could you get Dad's navy
blue suit out of his room?

177
00:06:53,844 --> 00:06:55,845
I... just can't go in there.

178
00:06:55,846 --> 00:06:57,779
Of course.

179
00:06:58,682 --> 00:07:01,017
It's weird,

180
00:07:01,018 --> 00:07:03,868
all of us being here without him.

181
00:07:13,197 --> 00:07:15,781
I'm very sorry for your loss, Mr. McCord.

182
00:07:15,782 --> 00:07:17,215
Thank you.

183
00:07:21,171 --> 00:07:24,290
I have some information about your father.

184
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:26,792
About the way he died.

185
00:07:26,793 --> 00:07:28,878
Wasn't it a heart attack?

186
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:32,048
Um... based on evidence
I found at the house,

187
00:07:32,049 --> 00:07:34,316
I asked the M.E. to
run a toxicology screen.

188
00:07:36,937 --> 00:07:40,273
Your father died of a barbiturate overdose.

189
00:07:40,274 --> 00:07:42,608
What?

190
00:07:42,609 --> 00:07:44,395
He didn't take drugs.

191
00:07:45,112 --> 00:07:46,529
There was an empty prescription bottle

192
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:49,464
of hydrocodone in the bathroom trash can.

193
00:07:50,234 --> 00:07:51,734
Hydrocodone is a painkiller.

194
00:07:51,735 --> 00:07:54,419
Yeah, for when his knee acted up.

195
00:07:55,072 --> 00:07:57,839
He refilled it yesterday morning.

196
00:08:02,329 --> 00:08:04,679
Are you saying he took all of them?

197
00:08:07,251 --> 00:08:10,002
Isn't there another explanation?

198
00:08:10,003 --> 00:08:12,103
I'm afraid not.

199
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:14,939
Your father's death was a suicide.

200

201
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:35,106
I saw him every day. I
mean, he was never down.

202
00:08:35,107 --> 00:08:36,607
Never. He was just himself.

203
00:08:36,608 --> 00:08:38,443
Daddy'd never let on how
he was really feeling.

204
00:08:38,444 --> 00:08:40,661
That just wasn't his way.

205
00:08:40,662 --> 00:08:43,081
That's true. Even when he was
forced off the union board,

206
00:08:43,082 --> 00:08:45,700
it took him years to tell us about it.

207
00:08:45,701 --> 00:08:47,585
That... that broke his spirit.

208
00:08:47,586 --> 00:08:49,037
Maybe he was sick?

209
00:08:49,038 --> 00:08:50,455
I called Dr. Peterson.

210
00:08:50,456 --> 00:08:52,707
Other than the heart condition,
he was in good health.

211
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:54,292
They made a mistake.

212
00:08:54,293 --> 00:08:57,295
Our dad would never do
this. It is a mortal sin.

213
00:08:57,296 --> 00:08:59,130
Maureen, it's the 21st century.

214
00:08:59,131 --> 00:09:00,465
Everybody knows about depression

215
00:09:00,466 --> 00:09:02,212
and what it can do to you,
even the Catholic Church.

216
00:09:02,213 --> 00:09:03,442
I'm sure Father Benedict...

217
00:09:03,443 --> 00:09:05,112
You will not tell Father
Benedict about this.

218
00:09:05,113 --> 00:09:07,455
No one outside this family is
to know anything about this.

219
00:09:07,456 --> 00:09:08,585
- You're being unreasonable.
- Am I?

220
00:09:08,586 --> 00:09:10,267
Forget about our friends
and family for a second.

221
00:09:10,268 --> 00:09:13,277
Dad was the father-in-law
to the Secretary of State.

222
00:09:13,278 --> 00:09:15,813
I mean, do you want all our
business all over the tabloids?

223
00:09:15,814 --> 00:09:17,398
Oh, no, I-I don't think that they would...

224
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:18,900
What, it's not important enough

225
00:09:18,901 --> 00:09:20,451
to make the news? Oh...

226
00:09:20,452 --> 00:09:22,036
Forget it. Tom, let's go.

227
00:09:22,037 --> 00:09:23,488
I... Where are the kids? Geez.

228
00:09:23,489 --> 00:09:25,755
Walked home an hour ago.

229
00:09:26,492 --> 00:09:27,658
Good night, Tom.

230
00:09:27,659 --> 00:09:28,925
Night.

231
00:09:29,661 --> 00:09:31,329
I'm glad you're here.

232
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:34,048
Someone has to put her in her
place every once in a while.

233
00:09:34,049 --> 00:09:35,083
We're all in shock.

234
00:09:36,752 --> 00:09:38,169
See you tomorrow, okay?

235
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:39,420
Yeah, we'll be here.

236
00:09:39,421 --> 00:09:40,471
All right.

237
00:09:40,472 --> 00:09:41,556
Good night.

238
00:09:41,557 --> 00:09:43,508
Night.

239
00:09:49,598 --> 00:09:51,516
Sorry about Maureen.

240
00:09:51,517 --> 00:09:54,185
Babe, the first time you brought
me home to meet your family,

241
00:09:54,186 --> 00:09:56,988
you said, "I'm sorry about Maureen."

242
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:00,024
Let's just take that as a given.

243
00:10:00,025 --> 00:10:02,743
She's just like my dad... no filter.

244
00:10:02,744 --> 00:10:06,531
Well, speaking your mind
is a McCord family trait

245
00:10:06,532 --> 00:10:08,181
that you all share.

246
00:10:08,867 --> 00:10:11,669
And our kids have inherited.

247
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:13,371
How are they doing?

248
00:10:13,372 --> 00:10:16,007
Processing, like the rest of us.

249
00:10:16,008 --> 00:10:18,042
Except Maureen; she's firmly ensconced

250
00:10:18,043 --> 00:10:19,377
on her sofa of denial.

251
00:10:19,378 --> 00:10:20,711
Henry,

252
00:10:20,712 --> 00:10:22,263
her world has been rocked.

253
00:10:22,264 --> 00:10:24,981
They all need to lean on you a little.

254
00:10:25,717 --> 00:10:28,118
Check on the kids.

255
00:10:35,444 --> 00:10:37,111
I say again,

256
00:10:37,112 --> 00:10:39,113
what wrong with a fruit basket?

257
00:10:39,114 --> 00:10:40,537
No one wants fruit, ever.

258
00:10:40,538 --> 00:10:42,632
Arrange for bagels, lox,
cream cheese, the works,

259
00:10:42,633 --> 00:10:44,536
to be delivered for breakfast tomorrow.

260
00:10:44,537 --> 00:10:46,504
When we find out what Mr. McCord died from,

261
00:10:46,505 --> 00:10:48,418
we'll send a donation in remembrance.

262
00:10:48,419 --> 00:10:49,966
The best thing we can do right now

263
00:10:50,576 --> 00:10:52,353
is keep things running smoothly here

264
00:10:52,354 --> 00:10:54,912
so the Secretary has all
the time and energy she needs

265
00:10:54,913 --> 00:10:56,396
to take care of her family.

266
00:10:57,016 --> 00:10:58,749
Good evening, team.

267
00:10:59,435 --> 00:11:01,486
Are we your team?

268
00:11:01,487 --> 00:11:02,437
Well, you are now.

269
00:11:02,438 --> 00:11:04,155
I need you to get to work right away

270
00:11:04,156 --> 00:11:05,824
on a new interagency task force.

271
00:11:05,825 --> 00:11:07,909
We're not quite finished with the last one.

272
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:08,788
Have you read

273
00:11:08,789 --> 00:11:10,161
the Africa report, by the way?

274
00:11:10,162 --> 00:11:11,196
I haven't had the time.

275
00:11:11,197 --> 00:11:12,947
I spent the day learning

276
00:11:12,948 --> 00:11:15,750
about invasive aquatic species.

277
00:11:15,751 --> 00:11:17,368
What are invasive aquatic...

278
00:11:17,369 --> 00:11:20,191
Little buggers coming
over from Asia and Europe,

279
00:11:20,192 --> 00:11:23,274
overrunning the North
American oceanic ecosystem.

280
00:11:23,275 --> 00:11:25,026
What do you mean, like squid?

281
00:11:25,027 --> 00:11:27,111
Are you mocking me, son?

282
00:11:27,112 --> 00:11:30,114
No, I would, I would never mock.

283
00:11:30,115 --> 00:11:32,986
You think terrorism is the only threat

284
00:11:32,987 --> 00:11:35,286
to our American way of life?

285
00:11:35,287 --> 00:11:38,956
Wait till the Australian mollusk
arrives and sets up house.

286
00:11:38,957 --> 00:11:41,516
With no natural predators,
all the river mouths

287
00:11:41,517 --> 00:11:44,937
in the Gulf of Mexico
will be completely clogged.

288
00:11:44,938 --> 00:11:46,989
Or when the poisonous
East Indian algae bloom

289
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:48,490
covers the Pacific coastline,

290
00:11:48,491 --> 00:11:51,298
good-bye crab season.

291
00:11:51,578 --> 00:11:56,031
Coastal and marine fisheries
are a $70 billion business.

292
00:11:56,032 --> 00:11:58,583
Do you think we can afford to lose that?

293
00:11:58,584 --> 00:12:01,036
All right. Coordinate with EPA tonight.

294
00:12:01,037 --> 00:12:04,006
I want a report to Congress
before the weather turns warm.

295
00:12:04,007 --> 00:12:06,888
Most of these critters
thrive in a balmy climate.

296
00:12:06,889 --> 00:12:09,044
Well, the secretary is out of town.

297
00:12:09,045 --> 00:12:11,346
I heard, but there's no time to waste.

298
00:12:11,347 --> 00:12:13,215
EPA can deliver the science.

299
00:12:13,216 --> 00:12:14,883
State and Commerce

300
00:12:14,884 --> 00:12:17,469
need to jump on the
international maritime angle...

301
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:18,687
crack down on smugglers,

302
00:12:18,688 --> 00:12:20,689
ramp up cargo and hull inspections.

303
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:23,308
Otherwise, these invasive
species will just keep coming

304
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:26,695
and the U.S. fishing
economy will grind to a halt.

305
00:12:26,696 --> 00:12:28,230
Okay, we're on it.

306
00:12:28,231 --> 00:12:30,949
I want an update in the morning.

307
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:33,334
Should I call the secretary?

308
00:12:33,898 --> 00:12:35,219
Not yet.

309
00:12:35,956 --> 00:12:38,540
Found this in the garage.

310
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:40,625
It's labeled "important papers."

311
00:12:40,626 --> 00:12:43,745
It's got the will in it,
this note that says, uh,

312
00:12:43,746 --> 00:12:45,213
he doesn't want a wake.

313
00:12:45,214 --> 00:12:46,248
What?

314
00:12:46,249 --> 00:12:48,800
Yeah, he says it's a waste of time

315
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:50,252
and expensive alcohol.

316
00:12:50,253 --> 00:12:52,387
Good. Who wants to see
Grandpa laid out all...

317
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,174
He's dead, John, not a zombie.

318
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:58,226
Come on, guys.

319
00:12:58,227 --> 00:12:59,594
Um, the will just says

320
00:12:59,595 --> 00:13:01,980
everything's split evenly between us kids.

321
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:04,566
Oh, here's the, uh, his
burial insurance policy

322
00:13:04,567 --> 00:13:06,018
he got from the union.

323
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:09,771
I will get that obituary over to the paper.

324
00:13:09,772 --> 00:13:11,239
I'm j-just gonna say

325
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,207
that he passed away.

326
00:13:14,577 --> 00:13:17,112
Father Benedict asked if, uh, someone

327
00:13:17,113 --> 00:13:18,780
was gonna speak at the service.

328
00:13:18,781 --> 00:13:19,581
Well, that's up to you.

329
00:13:19,582 --> 00:13:20,582
Well, I'd...

330
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:21,867
be too emotional, too sappy.

331
00:13:21,868 --> 00:13:22,834
Dad would hate that.

332
00:13:22,835 --> 00:13:24,969
I thought you might like to do it.

333
00:13:26,589 --> 00:13:29,791
I don't think that I'm the guy
to get up and talk about Dad.

334
00:13:29,792 --> 00:13:30,876
Maybe Erin or Shane.

335
00:13:30,877 --> 00:13:32,294
If you change your mind...

336
00:13:32,295 --> 00:13:34,061
I won't.

337
00:13:35,048 --> 00:13:37,132
We're expected at the
mortuary at around 11:00.

338
00:13:37,133 --> 00:13:39,351
I'd offer to drive, but, um,

339
00:13:39,352 --> 00:13:41,303
I suppose your security detail

340
00:13:41,304 --> 00:13:43,344
will still want to follow us through town.

341
00:13:43,345 --> 00:13:46,775
For the last time, it's protocol.

342
00:13:46,776 --> 00:13:48,477
Well, it's fine.

343
00:13:48,478 --> 00:13:50,612
I mean, maybe everybody
will think Dad's funeral

344
00:13:50,613 --> 00:13:52,981
has started early and
fall into line behind us.

345
00:13:52,982 --> 00:13:55,233
It won't be so bad, Maureen, I promise.

346
00:13:55,234 --> 00:13:56,618
There's lots of legroom,

347
00:13:56,619 --> 00:13:59,538
and they've got bottles of
water and candy in the back.

348
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:01,123
Not going to a prom.

349
00:14:01,124 --> 00:14:04,141
Going to find a coffin for my father.

350
00:14:05,828 --> 00:14:08,145
I'll come along, too.

351
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:10,549
I'll get my coat.

352
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:12,933
Thank you.

353
00:14:14,504 --> 00:14:18,423
20 gauge protective steel
with a poplar veneer.

354
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:20,175
Gloss coffee finish,

355
00:14:20,176 --> 00:14:22,227
and an oyster crepe interior.

356
00:14:22,228 --> 00:14:24,646
Grandpa wouldn't want something showy

357
00:14:24,647 --> 00:14:25,680
and overpriced.

358
00:14:25,681 --> 00:14:28,233
My father-in-law was
a man of simple taste.

359
00:14:28,234 --> 00:14:29,184
He was cheap.

360
00:14:29,185 --> 00:14:31,520
Say what you're saying.

361
00:14:31,521 --> 00:14:33,438
This one is a gloss Cambridge finish,

362
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:35,023
with swing bar hardware.

363
00:14:35,024 --> 00:14:37,591
It's $1,500.

364
00:14:39,362 --> 00:14:41,363
Maureen, what do you think?

365
00:14:41,364 --> 00:14:42,531
Mm.

366
00:14:42,532 --> 00:14:44,249
Let's talk about

367
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:47,051
our life's glory package.

368
00:14:47,753 --> 00:14:49,504
Prayer cards, a memorial book.

369
00:14:49,505 --> 00:14:50,705
Uh, a word with you.

370
00:14:50,706 --> 00:14:52,640
Excuse me.

371
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:56,795
Can we reconsider cremation?

372
00:14:56,796 --> 00:14:58,763
Absolutely not.

373
00:14:58,764 --> 00:15:01,266
It's just, he wouldn't want us
to spend all this money on him.

374
00:15:01,267 --> 00:15:03,685
Well, this isn't really for Grandpa, baby.

375
00:15:03,686 --> 00:15:04,941
It's for us.

376
00:15:04,942 --> 00:15:06,471
You know, so that we can feel

377
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:08,390
like we've given him a proper good-bye.

378
00:15:08,391 --> 00:15:10,025
We have a bit of a problem.

379
00:15:10,026 --> 00:15:11,359
Uh, Mr. McCord

380
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,211
allowed his insurance policy
to lapse four months ago.

381
00:15:14,897 --> 00:15:16,398
So none of this is covered.

382
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:17,616
I'm afraid not.

383
00:15:17,617 --> 00:15:19,401
Yeah, you know what,

384
00:15:19,402 --> 00:15:21,570
let's just...

385
00:15:21,571 --> 00:15:23,738
...we'll put it on my card

386
00:15:23,739 --> 00:15:25,624
and we'll figure it out later.

387
00:15:30,379 --> 00:15:32,747
Hey, John wants to heat
up a cheeseburger casserole

388
00:15:32,748 --> 00:15:34,749
and contact Grandpa on the Ouija board.

389
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,585
Oh, great, when you reach him,

390
00:15:36,586 --> 00:15:38,587
ask him what the password
is for his computer.

391
00:15:38,588 --> 00:15:41,438
Why are you trying to
go on Grandpa's computer?

392
00:15:42,091 --> 00:15:45,844
I was just thinking, you know.

393
00:15:45,845 --> 00:15:47,312
Why'd he do it?

394
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:48,930
What made him so sad

395
00:15:48,931 --> 00:15:51,316
that he wanted to end it like that.

396
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:53,151
Leave everything.

397
00:15:53,152 --> 00:15:55,119
Leave us.

398
00:15:57,607 --> 00:16:00,609
Mom said, uh, Debra was his girlfriend.

399
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:02,944
I figured she might be
able to tell us something,

400
00:16:02,945 --> 00:16:04,362
so I did an image search on my phone

401
00:16:04,363 --> 00:16:06,164
to try and figure out her last name.

402
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:07,666
And?

403
00:16:07,667 --> 00:16:10,118
Her name isn't Debra.

404
00:16:10,119 --> 00:16:11,453
It's Janet Nelson.

405
00:16:11,454 --> 00:16:13,288
She's not from Pittsburgh.

406
00:16:13,289 --> 00:16:14,789
She's an actress from L.A.

407
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:17,459
This photo was pulled off of the Internet.

408
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:20,045
Something isn't right.

409
00:16:20,046 --> 00:16:21,528
Okay.

410
00:16:26,102 --> 00:16:27,519
Here's his password.

411
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,804
Classic old person trick.

412
00:16:29,805 --> 00:16:32,357
Mm.

413
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:34,809
What a day, wow.

414
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:37,395
So your dad's insurance policy lapsed,

415
00:16:37,396 --> 00:16:39,814
so I gave them my card, of course,

416
00:16:39,815 --> 00:16:42,913
which annoyed Maureen, holy smoke.

417
00:16:42,914 --> 00:16:44,486
Babe, the kids went through Dad's computer.

418
00:16:44,487 --> 00:16:45,620
They found something.

419
00:16:45,621 --> 00:16:47,921
What do you mean?

420
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:52,043
About seven months ago,
he joined a dating site.

421
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:53,795
A woman contacted him.

422
00:16:53,796 --> 00:16:54,796
Said her name was Debra.

423
00:16:54,797 --> 00:16:56,464
Said all the right things.

424
00:16:56,465 --> 00:16:57,666
They had all the same interests.

425
00:16:57,667 --> 00:16:59,417
He wanted to meet, but
she said she couldn't.

426
00:16:59,418 --> 00:17:01,169
She was out of town
working on some investments.

427
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:02,170
Let me guess,

428
00:17:02,171 --> 00:17:03,471
she couldn't come home

429
00:17:03,472 --> 00:17:06,424
until all those issues were settled.

430
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:09,644
So, he offered to help out with a loan.

431
00:17:09,645 --> 00:17:11,313
How much?

432
00:17:11,314 --> 00:17:12,897
I don't know the total yet,

433
00:17:12,898 --> 00:17:15,183
but there are e-mails
on here from the bank.

434
00:17:15,184 --> 00:17:17,652
First it was about cash
transfers, then about

435
00:17:17,653 --> 00:17:18,903
taking out a line of credit on the house.

436
00:17:18,904 --> 00:17:20,155
It was everything he had.

437
00:17:20,156 --> 00:17:22,407
50 years of hard work and doing without.

438
00:17:22,408 --> 00:17:23,924
It's all gone.

439
00:17:25,945 --> 00:17:29,012
He couldn't see a way out.

440
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:31,950
We were a way out.

441
00:17:31,951 --> 00:17:33,434
We could have helped him.

442
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:38,123
Your dad admit that he'd been swindled?

443
00:17:38,124 --> 00:17:40,425
Call his children and ask for money?

444
00:17:40,426 --> 00:17:42,510
Live out his life like a burden.

445
00:17:42,511 --> 00:17:43,878
It wouldn't be like that.

446
00:17:43,879 --> 00:17:45,880
No.

447
00:17:45,881 --> 00:17:47,766
But to him it would.

448
00:17:47,767 --> 00:17:50,802
I know, but...

449
00:17:50,803 --> 00:17:51,970
I never thought his pride

450
00:17:51,971 --> 00:17:55,205
would mean more to him than his family.

451
00:17:56,859 --> 00:18:00,661
More than watching our kids grow up.

452
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:14,462
Okay, I'll say it, is there any
way we can get back the money?

453
00:18:14,907 --> 00:18:16,124
You're all thinking it.

454
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:18,172
Maybe not Henry and Elizabeth,

455
00:18:18,173 --> 00:18:20,041
but I could sure use my share.

456
00:18:20,042 --> 00:18:21,656
Look, I spoke with Detective Swanstrom

457
00:18:21,657 --> 00:18:24,125
and you know, he was sympathetic,

458
00:18:24,126 --> 00:18:25,577
but...

459
00:18:25,578 --> 00:18:27,796
the truth is, most of these scams

460
00:18:27,797 --> 00:18:29,247
are perpetrated in other countries.

461
00:18:29,248 --> 00:18:30,887
Well, then you're talking
to the wrong person.

462
00:18:30,888 --> 00:18:31,967
I mean, hell, you're sitting next

463
00:18:31,968 --> 00:18:32,994
to the Secretary of State.

464
00:18:32,995 --> 00:18:34,085
Other countries is her business.

465
00:18:34,086 --> 00:18:35,887
Could you do anything, Elizabeth?

466
00:18:35,888 --> 00:18:37,255
Pull some strings?

467
00:18:37,256 --> 00:18:38,640
I wish it was that simple.

468
00:18:38,641 --> 00:18:39,724
Well, make it simple.

469
00:18:39,725 --> 00:18:41,426
Call the president. Say it's protocol.

470
00:18:41,427 --> 00:18:43,178
The thing is, that the State Department

471
00:18:43,179 --> 00:18:45,347
doesn't really handle
these kinds of things.

472
00:18:45,348 --> 00:18:47,399
What my wife is too polite to say

473
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,984
is that what you're asking
her to do is unethical.

474
00:18:48,985 --> 00:18:50,936
Elizabeth is always
saying she wants to help.

475
00:18:50,937 --> 00:18:52,103
We need help.

476
00:18:52,104 --> 00:18:54,121
- Maureen... drop it.
- Why can't...!

477
00:18:57,026 --> 00:18:58,493
Well, like Shane was saying,

478
00:18:58,494 --> 00:19:00,510
you're not counting on that money, anyway.

479
00:19:06,752 --> 00:19:09,053
Hey, guys.

480
00:19:10,256 --> 00:19:11,339
Maureen.

481
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:12,874
Oh, thank you.

482
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:14,960
We're so sorry about Patrick.

483
00:19:14,961 --> 00:19:16,628
You remember Stan and Barry, right, guys?

484
00:19:16,629 --> 00:19:17,918
Oh, hey. Hey, guys.

485
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:20,564
- They worked with Dad on the union board.
- Come on in.

486
00:19:22,351 --> 00:19:24,269
I'll send you the e-mail address

487
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:25,804
that I want tracked

488
00:19:25,805 --> 00:19:29,608
and, I'm, uh,

489
00:19:29,609 --> 00:19:31,363
I'm hoping that Oliver Shaw

490
00:19:31,364 --> 00:19:33,248
can recommend someone.

491
00:19:33,249 --> 00:19:34,950
Are you sure there's nothing else

492
00:19:34,951 --> 00:19:36,868
I can do for you, or your family?

493
00:19:36,869 --> 00:19:38,203
Thanks for holding down the fort.

494
00:19:38,204 --> 00:19:39,838
I'll talk soon, okay?

495
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:44,176
Any room left in here?

496
00:19:44,177 --> 00:19:45,093
No, um,

497
00:19:45,094 --> 00:19:46,962
but we can find some.

498
00:19:46,963 --> 00:19:48,046
And we were downtown,

499
00:19:48,047 --> 00:19:49,514
visiting the guys...

500
00:19:49,515 --> 00:19:50,882
Bar, was it Mellon Center?

501
00:19:50,883 --> 00:19:52,217
Sure was.

502
00:19:52,218 --> 00:19:54,803
Yeah, your dad sees a welder we knew,

503
00:19:54,804 --> 00:19:55,721
leaving for the day.

504
00:19:55,722 --> 00:19:57,689
The guy doesn't have a coat on.

505
00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:00,225
Says, he gave it to his kid,

506
00:20:00,226 --> 00:20:03,228
'cause he couldn't afford a new one.

507
00:20:03,229 --> 00:20:05,781
Your dad takes off his own coat...

508
00:20:05,782 --> 00:20:08,400
It was vicuna, I remember.

509
00:20:08,401 --> 00:20:11,570
...and he just gives it to the guy.

510
00:20:11,571 --> 00:20:14,623
That's so like him.

511
00:20:14,624 --> 00:20:16,575
Well, we aren't going

512
00:20:16,576 --> 00:20:18,126
to take up any more of your time.

513
00:20:18,127 --> 00:20:20,996
My wife has the same kind of
heart condition as your dad.

514
00:20:20,997 --> 00:20:24,132
They were always telling
each other to take good care,

515
00:20:24,133 --> 00:20:26,484
but I guess sometimes
there's nothing to be done.

516
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:34,843
We just assumed he took a heart attack.

517
00:20:34,844 --> 00:20:36,395
Was it something else?

518
00:20:36,396 --> 00:20:39,765
The truth is...

519
00:20:39,766 --> 00:20:42,317
he was in a bad place, and he

520
00:20:42,318 --> 00:20:43,935
couldn't reach out for help.

521
00:20:43,936 --> 00:20:45,854
What Henry means is that
our dad was in a bad place

522
00:20:45,855 --> 00:20:47,155
because he was so sick.

523
00:20:47,156 --> 00:20:48,156
Maureen,

524
00:20:48,157 --> 00:20:49,941
if we can't talk about how he died,

525
00:20:49,942 --> 00:20:52,042
then we won't be able to mourn him.

526
00:20:54,197 --> 00:20:56,498
Our dad took his own life.

527
00:20:58,835 --> 00:21:00,669
I'm so sorry.

528
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:03,422
Well, thank you. It's been very difficult.

529
00:21:03,423 --> 00:21:05,874
And I hope it doesn't
change how you remember him.

530
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:08,343
No.

531
00:21:08,344 --> 00:21:11,111
Of course not.

532
00:21:11,848 --> 00:21:14,132
Thank you

533
00:21:14,133 --> 00:21:15,866
so much for coming.

534
00:21:22,308 --> 00:21:24,158
We agreed.

535
00:21:24,944 --> 00:21:26,812
No, Maureen, you insisted.

536
00:21:26,813 --> 00:21:29,614
I'm not gonna treat this
like some shameful secret.

537
00:21:29,615 --> 00:21:30,747
I'm not gonna lie about our father.

538
00:21:30,748 --> 00:21:32,534
Can't you keep your
high-and-mighty mouth shut

539
00:21:32,535 --> 00:21:33,702
for two seconds?

540
00:21:33,703 --> 00:21:36,007
But no, everything just
has to be done your way,

541
00:21:36,008 --> 00:21:37,089
like we don't count.

542
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:39,604
Hey, pot, you and the kettle
are looking a little black there.

543
00:21:39,605 --> 00:21:40,844
- Stay out of this, Shane.
- No.

544
00:21:40,845 --> 00:21:42,670
You don't get to decide for the rest of us

545
00:21:42,671 --> 00:21:44,109
what we can feel or say.

546
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:45,611
Yes, I do, because I was here every day,

547
00:21:45,612 --> 00:21:47,363
taking care of Mom, taking care of Dad.

548
00:21:47,364 --> 00:21:49,474
I live across town,
Erin's ten minutes away...

549
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:50,641
Yeah, but you were never here.

550
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:51,910
Maybe Sunday dinners,

551
00:21:51,911 --> 00:21:53,496
the Super Bowl. I cleaned the toilets.

552
00:21:53,497 --> 00:21:55,229
I cooked the meals. I took care of him.

553
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:56,959
If you took such good care of him, Maureen,

554
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,044
then why is he dead?

555
00:21:58,045 --> 00:21:59,777
- Erin, don't.
- No, I am sick of her

556
00:21:59,778 --> 00:22:01,080
lording everything over me!

557
00:22:01,081 --> 00:22:01,839
Can we get past this?

558
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,259
No, you are already past this!

559
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:05,011
You and Elizabeth breeze into town

560
00:22:05,012 --> 00:22:06,713
visiting us on your book tour,

561
00:22:06,714 --> 00:22:08,381
waving to us from the motorcade.

562
00:22:08,382 --> 00:22:10,012
Just don't think that
puts you in charge now,

563
00:22:10,013 --> 00:22:11,968
just because she can put the
funeral on her credit card!

564
00:22:11,969 --> 00:22:13,771
- What's this now?
- It was just a temporary fix.

565
00:22:13,772 --> 00:22:14,739
I'm just trying to help.

566
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:16,265
Trying to one up all of us like usual.

567
00:22:16,266 --> 00:22:17,300
You know what we call her.

568
00:22:17,301 --> 00:22:18,135
Queen Elizabeth.

569
00:22:18,136 --> 00:22:19,657
Queen Elizabeth... like it's a big secret!

570
00:22:19,658 --> 00:22:20,741
We're not stupid, Maureen.

571
00:22:20,742 --> 00:22:22,969
- We're not deaf!
- I never called her that.

572
00:22:23,112 --> 00:22:24,612
- I didn't! I didn't!
- But she did!

573
00:22:24,613 --> 00:22:26,497
Nobody should be calling her that!

574
00:22:26,498 --> 00:22:28,708
When you took up with
Elizabeth, you changed!

575
00:22:28,709 --> 00:22:30,625
- That's enough!
- Turning up your nose at us "yinzers,"

576
00:22:30,626 --> 00:22:32,911
acting like a new man with a fancy degree

577
00:22:32,912 --> 00:22:34,127
and a rich wife!

578
00:22:34,128 --> 00:22:35,789
You are way over the line, Maureen!

579
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:38,062
You guys are screaming so
loud we can't hear the TV.

580
00:22:38,063 --> 00:22:40,385
- What's going on?
- We're having a family discussion.

581
00:22:40,386 --> 00:22:42,170
Yeah, but it's over. Come on, kids.

582
00:22:42,171 --> 00:22:43,505
If it makes you feel better,

583
00:22:43,506 --> 00:22:44,756
we'll leave right after the funeral.

584
00:22:44,757 --> 00:22:45,696
Blow into town,

585
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:47,081
turn everything upside down,

586
00:22:47,082 --> 00:22:48,583
then blow right back out again.

587
00:22:48,584 --> 00:22:49,750
What else is new?

588
00:22:49,751 --> 00:22:51,369
Oh, you...

589
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:04,408
Got a minute?

590
00:23:04,409 --> 00:23:06,759
Not since 1992.

591
00:23:08,046 --> 00:23:09,663
Yeah, it's all right.

592
00:23:09,664 --> 00:23:11,048
Come in.

593
00:23:11,049 --> 00:23:14,718
I went through the East
Africa report again last night.

594
00:23:14,719 --> 00:23:17,143
There's been a change

595
00:23:17,266 --> 00:23:19,389
since we sent it to you for approval.

596
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:22,726
The CIA redacted a few
lines, classified them.

597
00:23:22,727 --> 00:23:23,710
As is their wont.

598
00:23:23,711 --> 00:23:24,928
The redacted portion

599
00:23:24,929 --> 00:23:27,981
is a short paragraph
regarding Senator Marc Stone.

600
00:23:27,982 --> 00:23:29,933
He was part of a congressional

601
00:23:29,934 --> 00:23:33,604
fact-finding trip to China in 2013.

602
00:23:33,605 --> 00:23:34,988
They visited

603
00:23:34,989 --> 00:23:37,858
the Wudang Construction Company.

604
00:23:37,859 --> 00:23:40,713
Wudang is run by the Chinese government

605
00:23:40,714 --> 00:23:44,557
and is at the top of our
list of corrupt contractors.

606
00:23:44,558 --> 00:23:45,666
You don't say.

607
00:23:45,667 --> 00:23:47,117
Wudang also

608
00:23:47,118 --> 00:23:50,984
owns an American subsidiary
called KPT Building.

609
00:23:50,985 --> 00:23:53,152
It's based in Arizona.

610
00:23:53,153 --> 00:23:55,705
That's Stone's home state.

611
00:23:55,706 --> 00:23:58,803
CIA has been all over this report

612
00:23:58,804 --> 00:24:00,377
since we started compiling it.

613
00:24:00,378 --> 00:24:03,041
Why did they wait until the last minute

614
00:24:03,042 --> 00:24:05,073
to classify that paragraph?

615
00:24:05,074 --> 00:24:07,991
Are you asking me a
question or is this a setup

616
00:24:07,992 --> 00:24:10,043
for an accusation?

617
00:24:10,044 --> 00:24:11,078
I think you sent

618
00:24:11,079 --> 00:24:12,746
the State Department on an invasive

619
00:24:12,747 --> 00:24:14,414
aquatic snipe hunt.

620
00:24:14,415 --> 00:24:16,550
Then you convinced someone at the Agency

621
00:24:16,551 --> 00:24:19,169
to redact the report.

622
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:21,054
What I do not understand is why.

623
00:24:21,055 --> 00:24:22,806
The CIA did it,

624
00:24:22,807 --> 00:24:25,592
so take it up with them.

625
00:24:25,593 --> 00:24:27,260
Or better yet,

626
00:24:27,261 --> 00:24:29,528
leave it alone.

627
00:24:30,598 --> 00:24:31,765
Is that an order?

628
00:24:31,766 --> 00:24:33,082
Yes.

629
00:24:36,738 --> 00:24:39,038
I don't take orders from you.

630
00:24:46,331 --> 00:24:48,415
Is that the office calling?

631
00:24:48,416 --> 00:24:51,785
Yeah, but not about State business.

632
00:24:51,786 --> 00:24:53,754
I asked Blake

633
00:24:53,755 --> 00:24:55,956
to trace the person who scammed your dad.

634
00:24:55,957 --> 00:24:57,507
You didn't have to do that.

635
00:24:57,508 --> 00:24:59,092
I know.

636
00:24:59,093 --> 00:25:01,294
But it worked.

637
00:25:01,295 --> 00:25:03,714
The scammer lives right here in Pittsburgh.

638
00:25:03,715 --> 00:25:05,981
It's his friend Stan.

639
00:25:16,561 --> 00:25:19,312
For what it's worth, he's pretty broken up.

640
00:25:19,313 --> 00:25:21,898
I got a full confession
in the car on the way over.

641
00:25:21,899 --> 00:25:24,368
Did he say why he did it?

642
00:25:24,369 --> 00:25:25,652
Well, short answer?

643
00:25:25,653 --> 00:25:27,070
He needed money.

644
00:25:27,071 --> 00:25:28,155
His sister's sick.

645
00:25:28,156 --> 00:25:29,406
They're drowning in bills.

646
00:25:29,407 --> 00:25:31,041
Says he read an article
about these scammers

647
00:25:31,042 --> 00:25:33,493
who were making thousands
ripping off older people.

648
00:25:33,494 --> 00:25:35,078
So he trolls the dating site,

649
00:25:35,079 --> 00:25:37,414
and happens to come
across your dad's profile.

650
00:25:37,415 --> 00:25:38,799
He knew how generous our dad was.

651
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,667
Thought he'd be an easy mark.

652
00:25:40,668 --> 00:25:42,669
The DA will be in touch.

653
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:44,820
I'm sorry, folks.

654
00:25:48,893 --> 00:25:50,310
That's that, then.

655
00:25:50,311 --> 00:25:52,062
Hey, Maureen?

656
00:25:52,063 --> 00:25:53,180
Wait.

657
00:25:54,399 --> 00:25:57,067
You're so angry at me.

658
00:25:57,068 --> 00:25:59,186
What can I do to make this right?

659
00:25:59,187 --> 00:26:01,104
Can you give me my father back?

660
00:26:01,105 --> 00:26:02,406
Can you make it like he never

661
00:26:02,407 --> 00:26:04,088
did this awful, awful thing?

662
00:26:04,089 --> 00:26:04,658
You know

663
00:26:04,659 --> 00:26:06,821
if he had reached out, I
would've done anything to help.

664
00:26:06,822 --> 00:26:07,444
Would you?

665
00:26:07,445 --> 00:26:08,361
Of course.

666
00:26:08,362 --> 00:26:10,113
Maureen, just let it go.

667
00:26:11,499 --> 00:26:13,849
I can't stop thinking why
he didn't call you, Henry.

668
00:26:13,918 --> 00:26:15,332
I mean, the rest of us, he knew

669
00:26:15,333 --> 00:26:16,870
we didn't have any room to take him in.

670
00:26:16,871 --> 00:26:18,955
God knows we don't have
any money, but you do.

671
00:26:18,956 --> 00:26:20,757
And then I remembered.

672
00:26:20,758 --> 00:26:22,676
A couple of years ago,

673
00:26:22,677 --> 00:26:24,344
I was helping him up the stairs

674
00:26:24,345 --> 00:26:25,629
after a few too many.

675
00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:27,047
It was, it was during that bad time

676
00:26:27,048 --> 00:26:28,432
when the union had kicked him to the curb.

677
00:26:28,433 --> 00:26:30,183
And he started talking about someone

678
00:26:30,184 --> 00:26:31,852
who turned their back on him.

679
00:26:31,853 --> 00:26:33,470
I figured it was a buddy of his.

680
00:26:33,471 --> 00:26:35,055
But no.

681
00:26:35,056 --> 00:26:36,857
He was talking about you.

682
00:26:36,858 --> 00:26:38,442
He said you rejected him.

683
00:26:38,443 --> 00:26:40,777
That you treated him like he was a failure.

684
00:26:40,778 --> 00:26:43,063
He said it was the worst
pain he'd ever felt.

685
00:26:43,064 --> 00:26:44,865
Maureen, that...

686
00:26:44,866 --> 00:26:46,319
that never happened.

687
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,118
Are calling Patrick McCord a liar?

688
00:26:48,119 --> 00:26:49,703
No, I'm saying

689
00:26:49,704 --> 00:26:51,705
that maybe you misunderstood.

690
00:26:51,706 --> 00:26:53,707
No, he was very clear.

691
00:26:53,708 --> 00:26:55,742
It was a while ago.

692
00:26:55,743 --> 00:26:57,760
But it happened.

693
00:27:00,748 --> 00:27:02,013
And at the lowest point of his life,

694
00:27:02,014 --> 00:27:03,009
if he reached out to you

695
00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:05,085
and you turned your back on him again...

696
00:27:05,086 --> 00:27:07,504
that would be the worst thing.

697
00:27:07,505 --> 00:27:08,922
Worse than losing all his money.

698
00:27:08,923 --> 00:27:10,173
Worse than death.

699
00:27:10,174 --> 00:27:12,726
So he didn't even try.

700
00:27:12,727 --> 00:27:14,344
Instead he just...

701
00:27:14,345 --> 00:27:15,995
went to sleep.

702
00:27:16,931 --> 00:27:18,732
And we can all say that we would've done

703
00:27:18,733 --> 00:27:20,567
anything to help him, that
we couldn't see the signs.

704
00:27:20,568 --> 00:27:22,402
We can say whatever we want
now, because it's too late.

705
00:27:22,403 --> 00:27:25,272
But I say...

706
00:27:25,273 --> 00:27:27,840
I say he's dead because of you.

707
00:27:57,805 --> 00:28:00,706
You want to go for a walk?

708
00:28:06,614 --> 00:28:08,114
My first year at UVA,

709
00:28:08,115 --> 00:28:11,067
I was working so hard to fit in.

710
00:28:11,068 --> 00:28:14,454
I just did not feel like I belonged there.

711
00:28:14,455 --> 00:28:15,705
Well, you were 17,

712
00:28:15,706 --> 00:28:17,556
you'd never been away from home.

713
00:28:20,077 --> 00:28:22,394
My dad came to Parent's Weekend.

714
00:28:24,248 --> 00:28:26,416
I showed him the campus, my dorm.

715
00:28:26,417 --> 00:28:28,418
He was his typical self...

716
00:28:28,419 --> 00:28:29,719
the room's too small,

717
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,805
the water pressure's too low,

718
00:28:31,806 --> 00:28:33,890
he wanted to know did they
give me a third-class berth

719
00:28:33,891 --> 00:28:35,342
'cause I was a scholarship kid?

720
00:28:35,343 --> 00:28:37,594
Well, your dad, never one to be

721
00:28:37,595 --> 00:28:39,995
stingy with his opinions.

722
00:28:41,349 --> 00:28:44,651
There was a big dinner that night,

723
00:28:44,652 --> 00:28:46,770
father and son thing.

724
00:28:46,771 --> 00:28:50,607
All the guys in my class were going.

725
00:28:50,608 --> 00:28:53,526
I didn't even tell him it was happening.

726
00:28:53,527 --> 00:28:56,413
That's how nervous I was he'd make a scene.

727
00:28:56,414 --> 00:28:58,949
He'd start quizzing the
big shots at my table

728
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:02,419
about how badly they treated their workers.

729
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:04,204
It seems crazy now,

730
00:29:04,205 --> 00:29:06,873
but being embarrassed at that dinner

731
00:29:06,874 --> 00:29:09,525
felt like it would end my world.

732
00:29:10,878 --> 00:29:12,629
So,

733
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:15,682
we were walking off-campus
to grab dinner in town.

734
00:29:15,683 --> 00:29:17,900
I took a wrong turn.

735
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:21,688
There we were at the hall.

736
00:29:21,689 --> 00:29:23,106
There was a big banner.

737
00:29:23,107 --> 00:29:25,025
All the guys were going in with their dads.

738
00:29:25,026 --> 00:29:27,560
And they looked like...

739
00:29:27,561 --> 00:29:29,896
what they were.

740
00:29:29,897 --> 00:29:32,232
Proper gentlemen.

741
00:29:32,233 --> 00:29:34,651
Young masters of the universe.

742
00:29:34,652 --> 00:29:35,819
I looked over.

743
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:37,320
My dad had stopped walking.

744
00:29:37,321 --> 00:29:40,457
Looked up at the banner.

745
00:29:40,458 --> 00:29:43,543
All the boys with their fathers.

746
00:29:43,544 --> 00:29:46,562
And I'll never forget the look on his face.

747
00:29:50,801 --> 00:29:53,986
He knew I was ashamed of him.

748
00:29:56,924 --> 00:29:59,592
That's what he told Maureen.

749
00:29:59,593 --> 00:30:01,645
Did you ever talk to him about it?

750
00:30:01,646 --> 00:30:05,253
Yeah, I tried to apologize
a few times over the years.

751
00:30:05,254 --> 00:30:06,683
He acted like he didn't remember,

752
00:30:06,684 --> 00:30:08,234
but he did.

753
00:30:08,235 --> 00:30:11,036
I keep thinking...

754
00:30:13,274 --> 00:30:15,525
...maybe when he called last week,

755
00:30:15,526 --> 00:30:19,515
should I have tried again

756
00:30:19,516 --> 00:30:21,031
to say I was sorry

757
00:30:21,032 --> 00:30:23,583
and really made him listen?

758
00:30:23,584 --> 00:30:25,618
Do you think

759
00:30:25,619 --> 00:30:29,605
maybe that was the opening
he needed to ask for my help?

760
00:30:31,625 --> 00:30:34,594
I think he knew you loved him.

761
00:30:34,595 --> 00:30:38,431
And he knew that you'd grow
up to be a good man, Henry.

762
00:30:38,432 --> 00:30:41,601
So I think you have to forgive

763
00:30:41,602 --> 00:30:43,436
that 17-year-old boy,

764
00:30:43,437 --> 00:30:47,273
who was young and thoughtless.

765
00:30:47,274 --> 00:30:51,144
If for no other reason,

766
00:30:51,145 --> 00:30:54,230
you'll need the practice

767
00:30:54,231 --> 00:30:56,366
to forgive Jason someday

768
00:30:56,367 --> 00:30:58,750
when he does something like that.

769
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:05,658
I think your dad did call for a reason.

770
00:31:05,659 --> 00:31:08,328
Not to ask for help.

771
00:31:08,329 --> 00:31:10,663
I think he needed to know

772
00:31:10,664 --> 00:31:14,099
that you two were ending on a good note.

773
00:31:17,722 --> 00:31:19,988
He was saying good-bye to me.

774
00:31:57,099 --> 00:31:58,232
Hey, Dad.

775
00:31:58,233 --> 00:31:59,817
Hi, Jace. You ready?

776
00:31:59,818 --> 00:32:01,450
Yeah, almost.

777
00:32:03,771 --> 00:32:06,657
I'm really sorry about the way
I talked to you the other day.

778
00:32:06,658 --> 00:32:08,609
It's okay.

779
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:11,662
I'm sorry I made fun of you about college.

780
00:32:11,663 --> 00:32:13,614
I don't want to be like you.

781
00:32:14,949 --> 00:32:16,617
I didn't want to be like my old man either.

782
00:32:16,618 --> 00:32:17,618
I get it.

783
00:32:17,619 --> 00:32:20,587
I mean, like you and Grandpa.

784
00:32:20,588 --> 00:32:24,307
I don't want to be fighting
with you when you die.

785
00:32:26,294 --> 00:32:29,278
I'm not gonna let that happen, I promise.

786
00:32:31,299 --> 00:32:34,718
It's true, my dad and I weren't close.

787
00:32:34,719 --> 00:32:36,053
We didn't see eye to eye

788
00:32:36,054 --> 00:32:40,323
on... well, anything.

789
00:32:42,277 --> 00:32:44,910
But I want you to feel
like you can talk to me.

790
00:32:47,198 --> 00:32:49,749
And I'll listen.

791
00:32:51,452 --> 00:32:53,052
That's really the...

792
00:32:55,206 --> 00:32:56,839
...key to everything.

793
00:33:00,828 --> 00:33:03,497
The Lord bless you and keep you.

794
00:33:03,498 --> 00:33:07,301
The Lord let his face shine
upon you and be gracious to you.

795
00:33:07,302 --> 00:33:12,005
The Lord look upon you
kindly and give you peace.

796
00:33:12,006 --> 00:33:13,340
Amen.

797
00:33:13,341 --> 00:33:14,725
Amen.

798
00:33:14,726 --> 00:33:17,678
Before we begin the commendation,

799
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:20,731
Patrick's son, Henry, has
asked to say a few words

800
00:33:20,732 --> 00:33:23,949
in remembrance of his father.

801
00:33:39,083 --> 00:33:41,418
The thing my dad hated
second most in the world

802
00:33:41,419 --> 00:33:43,003
was a restaurant.

803
00:33:43,004 --> 00:33:46,006
"Why drive to some place and
have a stranger cook you food

804
00:33:46,007 --> 00:33:48,458
when you can have it
better and cheaper at home?"

805
00:33:51,429 --> 00:33:54,715
The thing he hated most was a wedding.

806
00:33:54,716 --> 00:33:56,383
"Why would you spend all that money

807
00:33:56,384 --> 00:33:58,552
"when the marriage might not even work out?

808
00:33:58,553 --> 00:34:01,888
Stay married for ten years,
and then have a party."

809
00:34:01,889 --> 00:34:04,558
Maybe I'm giving you the
wrong idea about my dad.

810
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:06,944
He hated restaurants and weddings,

811
00:34:06,945 --> 00:34:10,280
but he loved a good meal.

812
00:34:10,281 --> 00:34:12,282
And he believed in marriage.

813
00:34:12,283 --> 00:34:16,286
He just didn't see the
point in all the fanfare.

814
00:34:16,287 --> 00:34:18,372
So I think it's a pretty safe bet

815
00:34:18,373 --> 00:34:19,656
that he would not be too happy

816
00:34:19,657 --> 00:34:22,341
with what we're doing here today.

817
00:34:23,294 --> 00:34:26,246
My dad was a proud man.

818
00:34:26,247 --> 00:34:29,299
He didn't believe in showing

819
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:32,552
any vulnerability to the world,

820
00:34:32,553 --> 00:34:35,922
and he passed that on to all of us.

821
00:34:35,923 --> 00:34:39,810
It mostly served us well,
but it robbed us, too.

822
00:34:39,811 --> 00:34:42,596
It robbed us of the gift of...

823
00:34:42,597 --> 00:34:45,315
letting someone else lend a hand,

824
00:34:45,316 --> 00:34:48,018
the gift of letting someone you love

825
00:34:48,019 --> 00:34:50,002
see you at-at your weakest.

826
00:34:51,739 --> 00:34:53,690
Made us hold onto grudges

827
00:34:53,691 --> 00:34:56,743
when all we really needed to do...

828
00:34:56,744 --> 00:35:00,030
was say...

829
00:35:00,031 --> 00:35:02,715
"I was wrong, and I'm sorry."

830
00:35:05,837 --> 00:35:07,788
I'm looking at my family now,

831
00:35:07,789 --> 00:35:12,459
and... I see how proud you are...

832
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:15,128
and how strong you're all trying to be,

833
00:35:15,129 --> 00:35:19,132
but I think the best gift that we can give

834
00:35:19,133 --> 00:35:22,485
to our father now that he's gone...

835
00:35:28,893 --> 00:35:31,194
...is to admit that
our hearts are breaking.

836
00:35:31,195 --> 00:35:34,231
I think it would go better for us

837
00:35:34,232 --> 00:35:37,583
if we... could lean on each other...

838
00:35:40,655 --> 00:35:43,005
...and let our hearts break together.

839
00:35:46,711 --> 00:35:48,677
I think he would like that.

840
00:35:50,331 --> 00:35:53,333
And then shape up and
pull ourselves together

841
00:35:53,334 --> 00:35:56,420
and, Jiminy Christmas, quit that crying.

842
00:36:08,182 --> 00:36:10,851
"A song of ascents.

843
00:36:10,852 --> 00:36:14,237
"I raise my eyes toward the mountains.

844
00:36:14,238 --> 00:36:16,990
From whence shall come my help?"

845
00:36:34,625 --> 00:36:37,260
Henry, smiling like he doesn't have

846
00:36:37,261 --> 00:36:38,285
Oh, I was not smiling.

847
00:36:38,286 --> 00:36:39,262
...a care in the world.

848
00:36:39,263 --> 00:36:41,131
I was scared to death.

849
00:36:41,132 --> 00:36:43,133
Yeah, 'cause Dad's car
is sinking into the lake.

850
00:36:43,134 --> 00:36:46,052
And Dad says, "Son,
what the hell happened?"

851
00:36:46,053 --> 00:36:47,471
And Henry says...

852
00:36:47,472 --> 00:36:49,689
I said I swerved to
avoid a cow in the road.

853
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:50,953
- What?
- Come on.

854
00:36:50,954 --> 00:36:52,225
- And, no, and Dad...
- That's true.

855
00:36:52,226 --> 00:36:54,277
- It's true.
- And Dad says, "Listen, kid, next time...

856
00:36:54,278 --> 00:36:56,530
there's a cow in the road,
don't crash the car just..."

857
00:36:56,531 --> 00:36:58,231
"Bring home the steak dinner."

858
00:36:58,232 --> 00:37:01,201
You were the reason he wouldn't
let me get a car till I was 18.

859
00:37:01,202 --> 00:37:03,236
No, pal, that was because
you stole Mom's car

860
00:37:03,237 --> 00:37:04,488
and blew the engine doing doughnuts

861
00:37:04,489 --> 00:37:05,489
in the parking lot of the A&P.

862
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:06,706
- Okay, I did do that.
- Remember?

863
00:37:06,707 --> 00:37:08,959
- With me, unbuckled in the back seat.
- Yeah.

864
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:12,629
I was just checking on
the progress with the EPA.

865
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:14,381
The staff has been in meetings all day.

866
00:37:14,382 --> 00:37:19,169
While you've been in here,
checking up on Senator Stone?

867
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:21,755
You called Marlene Creston,

868
00:37:21,756 --> 00:37:23,473
the head of the Senate
Select Committee on Ethics.

869
00:37:23,474 --> 00:37:25,809
She didn't find anything.

870
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:27,394
And I still have no idea

871
00:37:27,395 --> 00:37:29,479
why you wanted that paragraph classified.

872
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,932
You gonna let it go now?

873
00:37:31,933 --> 00:37:33,832
That's not in my nature.

874
00:37:36,571 --> 00:37:38,871
Okay then.

875
00:37:41,909 --> 00:37:45,829
Stone is an ally of Dalton's,

876
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:48,865
running for reelection on
his record, which is spotless,

877
00:37:48,866 --> 00:37:51,585
but his challenger is well-funded.

878
00:37:51,586 --> 00:37:53,119
She's going negative,

879
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:55,789
so Stone approved his super PAC

880
00:37:55,790 --> 00:37:58,458
and a dark money nonprofit
organization to fund it.

881
00:37:58,459 --> 00:38:03,346
KPT Building made a donation
to that nonprofit of $100,000.

882
00:38:03,347 --> 00:38:07,184
KPT Building, which is owned
by the Chinese government.

883
00:38:07,185 --> 00:38:09,970
KPT Building, which is
an American subsidiary

884
00:38:09,971 --> 00:38:11,388
of Wudang Construction,

885
00:38:11,389 --> 00:38:14,391
which is owned by the
Chinese government, yes.

886
00:38:14,392 --> 00:38:16,047
So is this a quid pro quo?

887
00:38:16,048 --> 00:38:16,974
Of course not.

888
00:38:16,975 --> 00:38:18,645
KPT just wants to defeat Stone's opponent,

889
00:38:18,646 --> 00:38:20,113
who's for stricter logging controls.

890
00:38:20,114 --> 00:38:21,698
But the Chinese government

891
00:38:21,699 --> 00:38:25,151
is still indirectly financing
an American election.

892
00:38:25,152 --> 00:38:27,237
And thanks to the vagaries
of Citizens United,

893
00:38:27,238 --> 00:38:29,239
it's all perfectly legal.

894
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:31,825
Then why redact the paragraph?

895
00:38:31,826 --> 00:38:34,828
Because if someone with an ax to grind

896
00:38:34,829 --> 00:38:37,631
were to read the unredacted
East Africa report,

897
00:38:37,632 --> 00:38:40,417
they could possibly make a connection

898
00:38:40,418 --> 00:38:42,168
between Stone and Wudang Construction.

899
00:38:42,169 --> 00:38:43,386
They could make it look

900
00:38:43,387 --> 00:38:45,138
like Marc Stone is in bed with the Chinese.

901
00:38:45,139 --> 00:38:46,640
Isn't he?

902
00:38:46,641 --> 00:38:50,927
He's an honest politician who's
been forced to accept dark money

903
00:38:50,928 --> 00:38:54,514
so he can continue to play
on this new level field.

904
00:38:54,515 --> 00:38:55,849
Don't blame me, blame the Supreme Court

905
00:38:55,850 --> 00:38:56,933
for a bad decision.

906
00:38:56,934 --> 00:38:58,568
The president would love to put a stake

907
00:38:58,569 --> 00:39:00,570
through the heart of Citizens United,

908
00:39:00,571 --> 00:39:01,988
but you know he's not gonna get traction

909
00:39:01,989 --> 00:39:03,323
in congress anytime soon.

910
00:39:03,324 --> 00:39:05,575
He'll need a second term
and every bit of support

911
00:39:05,576 --> 00:39:08,945
in the senate that he can muster.

912
00:39:08,946 --> 00:39:13,250
So, yes, I asked a friend at the Agency

913
00:39:13,251 --> 00:39:15,201
to redact that section of the report.

914
00:39:15,202 --> 00:39:16,620
I didn't tell the president about it.

915
00:39:16,621 --> 00:39:20,624
If the contribution ever
does become public knowledge,

916
00:39:20,625 --> 00:39:22,926
Dalton can honestly say
he knows nothing about it.

917
00:39:22,927 --> 00:39:24,678
And what about the secretary?

918
00:39:24,679 --> 00:39:25,679
She's protected as well.

919
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:26,930
That's our job.

920
00:39:26,931 --> 00:39:28,548
We take the hits so they don't have to.

921
00:39:28,549 --> 00:39:30,600
But you didn't bring me in beforehand,

922
00:39:30,601 --> 00:39:32,519
so now I have to tell her.

923
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:34,888
Do what you want.

924
00:39:34,889 --> 00:39:36,439
Just make sure she knows

925
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:39,442
we're saving American's
oceans while you're at it.

926
00:39:39,443 --> 00:39:42,896
Those invasive species really are a menace.

927
00:39:42,897 --> 00:39:44,864
Russell.

928
00:39:44,865 --> 00:39:46,149
In the future,

929
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:48,985
you might consider being
more forthcoming with me.

930
00:39:48,986 --> 00:39:52,289
That's not really in my nature,

931
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:56,091
but... noted.

932
00:40:02,383 --> 00:40:03,717
All our bags are downstairs.

933
00:40:03,718 --> 00:40:06,018
Then this is the last one.

934
00:40:07,722 --> 00:40:10,423
I bet you're glad to be getting home,

935
00:40:10,424 --> 00:40:12,392
get back to being yourself.

936
00:40:12,393 --> 00:40:14,427
What do you mean?

937
00:40:14,428 --> 00:40:17,847
I don't know, it's just...

938
00:40:17,848 --> 00:40:20,183
at home, you would never let anyone

939
00:40:20,184 --> 00:40:22,736
talk to you the way that Aunt Maureen does.

940
00:40:22,737 --> 00:40:24,437
Why don't you ever shut her down?

941
00:40:24,438 --> 00:40:27,824
Oh, Stevie, I was so
young when my parents died.

942
00:40:27,825 --> 00:40:30,827
Then it was just your Uncle Will and me.

943
00:40:30,828 --> 00:40:34,447
We were away at boarding
schools most of the year.

944
00:40:34,448 --> 00:40:38,168
Thanksgivings, just the two of us.

945
00:40:38,169 --> 00:40:40,003
Dinner in front of the TV.

946
00:40:40,004 --> 00:40:42,354
One Christmas, I just...

947
00:40:44,425 --> 00:40:46,358
...stayed at school.

948
00:40:47,461 --> 00:40:50,513
There was this huge snowstorm,

949
00:40:50,514 --> 00:40:54,134
and I got snowed in,

950
00:40:54,135 --> 00:40:59,121
and it was so... quiet.

951
00:41:00,441 --> 00:41:03,792
I didn't speak to another soul for days.

952
00:41:07,365 --> 00:41:09,449
And then I fell in love with your dad.

953
00:41:10,534 --> 00:41:12,652
And he took me home and introduced me

954
00:41:12,653 --> 00:41:17,407
to his big, messy, raucous family.

955
00:41:17,408 --> 00:41:20,043
At the McCord house,

956
00:41:20,044 --> 00:41:22,996
it was never quiet.

957
00:41:22,997 --> 00:41:27,717
Sometimes they're laughing,
sometimes fighting,

958
00:41:27,718 --> 00:41:32,505
but it's always loud and on fire.

959
00:41:32,506 --> 00:41:37,177
And if I shut Maureen down,

960
00:41:37,178 --> 00:41:39,229
I'd be putting out that fire.

961
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:40,764
I don't want to do that.

962
00:41:40,765 --> 00:41:42,982
I just want to be a part of it.

963
00:41:42,983 --> 00:41:44,150
You know?

964
00:41:44,151 --> 00:41:45,784
Yeah.

965
00:41:47,021 --> 00:41:49,522
You need any help cleaning out the house...

966
00:41:49,523 --> 00:41:52,075
Erin and Shane and the
kids will be around, so...

967
00:41:52,076 --> 00:41:54,077
Well, maybe we'll get
lucky and find some cash

968
00:41:54,078 --> 00:41:55,361
after the bank takes their cut.

969
00:41:55,362 --> 00:41:57,614
Maybe. Either way, we'll be all right.

970
00:41:57,615 --> 00:41:58,865
I know we will.

971
00:41:58,866 --> 00:41:59,877
Easter?

972
00:41:59,878 --> 00:42:00,700
Oh.

973
00:42:00,701 --> 00:42:02,301
Bye.

974
00:42:05,005 --> 00:42:06,372
Bye.

975
00:42:10,010 --> 00:42:11,845
Bye!

976
00:42:14,131 --> 00:42:16,099
Later!

977
00:42:28,696 --> 00:42:30,563
_

978
00:42:30,564 --> 00:42:31,904
It is uncanny.

979
00:42:31,905 --> 00:42:34,784
I mean, Blake knows exactly when
it's the best time to get me.

980
00:42:34,785 --> 00:42:36,152
It's just...

981
00:42:36,153 --> 00:42:37,454
I called Uncle Will.

982
00:42:37,455 --> 00:42:38,905
Hey.

983
00:42:38,906 --> 00:42:40,373
- Hey, Will.
- Hi. Hey, Will.

984
00:42:40,374 --> 00:42:41,624
How are you?

985
00:42:41,625 --> 00:42:44,377
Well, I-I could use
another three hours sleep.

986
00:42:44,378 --> 00:42:47,046
Henry, I-I am so... so sorry

987
00:42:47,047 --> 00:42:49,165
that I couldn't make
it out for the funeral.

988
00:42:49,166 --> 00:42:51,551
You know how fond I was of your father.

989
00:42:51,552 --> 00:42:53,253
He was a tough old guy.

990
00:42:53,254 --> 00:42:54,587
Yeah, he was.

991
00:42:54,588 --> 00:42:55,805
Thanks, Will.

992
00:42:55,806 --> 00:42:57,474
- Hi, Uncle Will.
- Hi.

993
00:42:57,475 --> 00:42:58,686
There you go. Here you go.

994
00:42:58,687 --> 00:42:59,759
Hello, McCords.

995
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,144
We miss you.

996
00:43:02,065 --> 00:43:04,086
Hey, what are you doing?

997
00:43:04,185 --> 00:43:05,648
Where are you?

998
00:43:05,649 --> 00:43:13,467
