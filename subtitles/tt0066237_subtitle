1
00:00:13,113 --> 00:00:16,708
Chant the name Hari.

2
00:00:16,783 --> 00:00:18,876
Go slow, brother.

3
00:00:19,786 --> 00:00:22,721
Chant the name Hari.

4
00:00:24,057 --> 00:00:25,888
My... My...

5
00:00:26,793 --> 00:00:28,886
Hold yourself together, sister. Be calm.

6
00:00:31,064 --> 00:00:33,123
I have no one else left.

7
00:00:39,072 --> 00:00:43,736
Don't feel that way, sister.
We are all with you.

8
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:48,907
I have lost everything.
How will I live now?

9
00:00:48,982 --> 00:00:51,917
We are all with you, sister.
- How will I live?

10
00:02:29,048 --> 00:02:30,709
Get down.

11
00:02:30,783 --> 00:02:32,216
Go on, right.

12
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:46,785
Sit down there.

13
00:05:29,762 --> 00:05:32,196
Is this your first interview?
- No.

14
00:05:36,869 --> 00:05:40,032
Are you aware of the type
of questions they ask?

15
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:41,698
It's not very predictable.

16
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:48,206
Will they ask in English?
- They may, probably.

17
00:05:50,783 --> 00:05:53,115
Then the answer should also be
in English... - Yes, English.

18
00:05:53,886 --> 00:05:55,217
Yes, naturally.

19
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,193
Do you do mending?
- Why?

20
00:06:35,261 --> 00:06:37,695
I have trousers that need
mending. - No we don't do...

21
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:40,028
...mending. - Why? - We
don't sew used clothes.

22
00:06:40,099 --> 00:06:43,091
I'll leave them here and go.
- No you can try some small shop.

23
00:07:11,063 --> 00:07:15,659
Here you are.
- How much? - Ten rupees.

24
00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:28,009
Your name, please.
- Siddartha Choudhury.

25
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:34,285
Could you show us your papers,
please? - Yes, sir.

26
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:18,157
Would you like to? - How old are
you? - I'm just over 25, sir.

27
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:24,329
You are a B. Sc? - Yes, sir. - 
When did you graduate? - 1966.

28
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:27,332
Have you been idle ever since?

29
00:08:27,406 --> 00:08:30,000
No, sir. I was at the medical
college for 2 years.

30
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:36,338
What were you doing there?
Studying, sir. - Only for two years?

31
00:08:36,749 --> 00:08:37,841
Yes, sir.

32
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:41,011
What made you give up medicine?
Did you suddenly...

33
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:46,354
...lose interest in medicine?
- No, sir. I lost my father.

34
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:49,851
I see.
- What's your aim in life?

35
00:08:54,767 --> 00:08:57,702
Right now it's to find a job, sir.

36
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:01,234
But the job you've applied for
has nothing to do with medicine.

37
00:09:01,774 --> 00:09:04,834
No, sir. But I also did botany
for my science degree.

38
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:09,811
Do you like flowers?
- Not unconditionally.

39
00:09:11,817 --> 00:09:13,717
Some I like, some I don't.

40
00:09:13,786 --> 00:09:16,983
Does the term mitochondria
suggest anything to you?

41
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:20,817
It's a botanical term, sir.
Mitochondria are small threadlike...

42
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:22,986
...bodies in cytoplasm.

43
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:29,997
Who was the prime minister of
England at the time of independence?

44
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:34,000
Whose independence, sir?
- Our independence.

45
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,675
Atkins. - What would you regard
as the most outstanding and significant...

46
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:41,008
...event of the last decade?

47
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:56,694
The war in Vietnam, sir. - More
significant than the landing...

48
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:59,196
...on the moon?
- I think so, sir.

49
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:05,701
Could you tell us why you think so?

50
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:07,705
Because the moon landing...

51
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:14,041
You see, we weren't entirely unprepared
for the moon landing.

52
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:17,708
We knew that it had to come
some time. We knew about the...

53
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:21,048
...space flights, the great advances
in space technology.

54
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:23,120
So we knew it had to happen.

55
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:27,052
I'm not saying it wasn't
a remarkable achievement...

56
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:29,321
...but it wasn't unpredictable.

57
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:31,056
The fact that they did
land on the moon.

58
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,792
Do you think that the war in
Vietnam was unpredictable?

59
00:10:33,866 --> 00:10:37,734
Not the war itself. But what
it has revealed about the...

60
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:42,900
...Vietnamese people. About
their extraordinary power...

61
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:45,239
...of resistance. Ordinary
people, peasants and...

62
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:47,404
...no one knew that they
had it in them.

63
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,074
This isn't a matter of
technology, it's...

64
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:54,245
...just plain human courage,
and takes your breath away.

65
00:10:59,091 --> 00:11:01,082
Are you a communist?

66
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:04,093
I don't think one has to
be one in order to admire...

67
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:05,755
...Vietnam, sir.

68
00:11:07,366 --> 00:11:10,199
That doesn't answer my
question. However...

69
00:11:11,771 --> 00:11:13,705
...you may go now.

70
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:23,208
Listen.

71
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:28,219
This is broken.

72
00:11:33,392 --> 00:11:36,884
Hey!
- I've been watching you for some time.

73
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:40,721
Why do you look so depressed?

74
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:43,735
No, I've been walking in the
sun and I've got a headache.

75
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,061
Don't you have a job yet?

76
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:50,239
Are you still applying?
- Yes.

77
00:12:00,152 --> 00:12:03,747
In the end, the time will come
when you'll start believing...

78
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:07,759
...that you don't have a goal
within yourself. And that's not true.

79
00:12:08,027 --> 00:12:17,698
I know you. While you're still
unemployed why don't you...

80
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:22,036
...come to our place sometime?

81
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:26,208
You were active in the union
in your college days.

82
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:29,714
If you are with us then you
will be able to do something.

83
00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:32,216
The party has a lot of odd
jobs to be attended to.

84
00:12:32,284 --> 00:12:35,048
If you remain like this and
roam in the sun then both...

85
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:38,887
...your mind and your health
will be undermined.

86
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:46,058
What? Will you come? Or is it that
you've no faith in politics?

87
00:12:46,132 --> 00:12:51,729
No, brother Naresh. I need a job.
Otherwise the problem...

88
00:12:51,804 --> 00:12:56,070
...is that...
- Your sister is employed, isn't it?

89
00:12:57,076 --> 00:13:03,242
Is it hurting your pride? - No,
papa didn't leave much for us.

90
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:08,685
That's true. It is not possible
for a honest man to do...

91
00:13:08,754 --> 00:13:11,188
...business and leave something.

92
00:13:11,757 --> 00:13:13,190
I know.

93
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:17,091
Why don't you join some factory?

94
00:13:17,763 --> 00:13:20,698
Do some work as a labourer.
What's wrong in that?

95
00:13:20,766 --> 00:13:24,031
These days... - No more advice
please. No more advice please.

96
00:13:24,103 --> 00:13:26,697
So many people have given me 
so much advice that my mind...

97
00:13:26,772 --> 00:13:29,707
...is stuffed with advice
and is choking.

98
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:32,207
You're a nice person and
I admire you, but still...

99
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:33,905
...l'm telling you.

100
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:36,709
Either stop your lectures or go
away. I don't like hearing...

101
00:13:36,782 --> 00:13:38,374
...your speeches any more.

102
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:40,884
Would you like to
get out of Calcutta?

103
00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:45,317
Would it be okay if I get you
a job outside Calcutta?

104
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:48,383
What job?
- Medical representative.

105
00:13:48,794 --> 00:13:53,128
Outside Calcutta! - That's why
I didn't tell you before.

106
00:13:53,232 --> 00:13:56,224
Dr. Suren Das. Do you know him?

107
00:13:56,302 --> 00:14:00,739
National Pharmaceuticals.
I know him well.

108
00:14:01,073 --> 00:14:04,065
If you want, I can
give you a letter.

109
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:10,014
Let me talk with him.

110
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:18,182
One tablet, please.

111
00:14:22,761 --> 00:14:24,752
Can I get some water?
- Water?

112
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:31,764
How much?
- 60 paise.

113
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:36,030
What do you want?

114
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:49,714
The 1970-71 budget comes up
with proposals to stimulate...

115
00:14:49,788 --> 00:14:55,886
...growth, export drive and import
substitution. Additional taxes...

116
00:14:55,961 --> 00:14:59,055
...on certain luxury and
consumer goods and an...

117
00:14:59,131 --> 00:15:01,725
...increase in wealth tax and
income tax rates for higher...

118
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,233
...income groups.

119
00:15:06,005 --> 00:15:09,998
Relief with the rise of the
exemption limit to 5000 rupees...

120
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:13,010
...on income tax and a greater
sense of security to low...

121
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:16,013
...income groups through revised
pension proposals.

122
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:20,014
New taxes are expected to fetch
an additional revenue...

123
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:22,679
...of 1700 million rupees.

124
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:25,854
An explosion! Let's run!

125
00:15:53,886 --> 00:15:56,446
Look what happened to this watch.
It fell from my hand.

126
00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:15,195
The balance has broken.
- How much will it cost? - 850.

127
00:16:17,743 --> 00:16:19,176
Okay give it to me.

128
00:17:18,837 --> 00:17:22,830
The lymphatics of the female breast,
if you remember, begins...

129
00:17:22,908 --> 00:17:26,844
...with the flexes around
the gland itself.

130
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:32,073
Now this flexes which we note is quite
different from the lymphatics...

131
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:35,348
...which drain the central
region of the gland.

132
00:17:35,754 --> 00:17:40,191
But the gland at its
central region is...

133
00:18:59,371 --> 00:19:01,862
Oh! What a beautiful place.

134
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:06,805
Wow! This is wonderful.

135
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:26,661
This is where the world started.

136
00:19:26,732 --> 00:19:28,666
This is where the magic is.

137
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:30,827
Great.

138
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,731
Look at the cow. Delightful!

139
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,837
Wow! What a place!
- Fantastic!

140
00:19:39,077 --> 00:19:43,207
We come to Calcutta and
we like every one of you people.

141
00:19:43,282 --> 00:19:45,750
You are truly our friends.

142
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:50,085
Who's that?
- Open the door, this is Siddartha.

143
00:19:50,155 --> 00:19:53,022
Who is Siddartha? - Stop playing
the fool and open the door.

144
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:03,699
Come in. - Where is Sibu? - He
has gone to get cigarettes...

145
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:05,430
...he will be back soon.

146
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:22,247
Oh! What a day!
- What happened?

147
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:26,718
What can happen? The same routine.

148
00:20:26,792 --> 00:20:31,388
That's the problem. Time doesn't
want to pass at all.

149
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:35,229
Walking all day in the sun.

150
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,738
Tell me, what are you doing?

151
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:49,077
What are you doing?

152
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:53,081
This is a highly skilled job.

153
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:58,249
You're stealing the funds
meant for the Red Cross?

154
00:21:05,864 --> 00:21:08,697
Hey, Siddartha. This is not
good. Give it to me.

155
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:13,368
Where did you think your
Red Cross got the money?

156
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:15,030
All day I walked in the sun.

157
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:16,699
Don't I have a share in it?

158
00:21:17,709 --> 00:21:19,700
All of you... Hell! All of you.

159
00:21:22,214 --> 00:21:27,049
I come here only so that I can
relax for some time and you...

160
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:30,211
You relax. Who is stopping you?

161
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,223
If you want to sleep
then I have a drug.

162
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:35,727
How low you've stooped.
- The whole country is going...

163
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:38,729
...down, brother. If
I don't stoop down then do...

164
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:41,061
...you want me suspended
in space?

165
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:43,226
You're already the son of rich
parents and you hail from...

166
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,293
...a famous family.

167
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:47,736
What do you know about my family?
Do you know about...

168
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:49,740
...my uncle. Do you know about
my grandpa? Moreover, what...

169
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:52,140
...relationship is there between
this and my family?

170
00:21:52,911 --> 00:21:56,244
Two books have been stolen.
- What books? - Yes, the books...

171
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:59,751
...on those two subjects.

172
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:02,083
If I don't get the books then
I can't pass the exams.

173
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:04,418
How will I get so much money
in such a short time, now?

174
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:09,017
How does he play, Baren? - Left
out. - It's Sibhu. Open the door.

175
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:10,686
Kleptomaniac number one.

176
00:22:16,201 --> 00:22:17,998
Hey, how long have you been here?
- Just now.

177
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:20,937
Stop standing and chatting
there. Close the door.

178
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:25,337
Take this.

179
00:22:28,046 --> 00:22:31,379
You also have one.
- Thanks.

180
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:32,712
Are you still on it?

181
00:22:32,784 --> 00:22:36,220
What 's wrong with this chap? It
is becoming more difficult day by day.

182
00:22:36,722 --> 00:22:39,054
I'm thinking of vacating the house.

183
00:22:39,124 --> 00:22:42,719
Vacating the house! He can't move
a step and he is thinking...

184
00:22:42,794 --> 00:22:47,060
...of vacating the house.
- Are you his advisor? - Ask him.

185
00:22:47,132 --> 00:22:49,225
Is that so, buddy?
- Leave that. You too!

186
00:22:49,901 --> 00:22:54,201
Is that so? He is trying
to hook a girl.

187
00:22:54,272 --> 00:22:59,232
He is asking me, how do I
proceed. Tell me step by step.

188
00:22:59,311 --> 00:23:04,248
Listen friend, this is too much.
This is gross injustice.

189
00:23:04,316 --> 00:23:06,682
Then what did you tell him?
- I told him...

190
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:09,687
Hey don't say anything. Stop.
- Leave me.

191
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:12,019
If you play the fool with me then
I will spill all the beans.

192
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:14,024
You carry on with the work.
Don't tell him anything.

193
00:23:14,092 --> 00:23:16,219
Wait, another 2 rupees.

194
00:23:16,294 --> 00:23:19,263
2 rupees, Stop all that
nonsense and do it fast.

195
00:23:19,331 --> 00:23:20,696
Come soon, I'm getting impatient.

196
00:23:20,766 --> 00:23:23,200
The delay did help. Look
at this. Some more money.

197
00:23:23,268 --> 00:23:25,259
You can have them if you like.

198
00:23:25,337 --> 00:23:33,039
What's that? - Hey. - Tell me. - 
Will you lend me this? - What?

199
00:23:33,111 --> 00:23:38,708
This magazine. - Buddy, this has
resale value, do you know that?

200
00:23:38,784 --> 00:23:41,116
Ten rupees per copy.

201
00:23:41,186 --> 00:23:45,714
If I give you that you'll
sell it and pocket the money.

202
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:47,725
Why do you take everyone
to be in your category?

203
00:23:47,793 --> 00:23:52,230
Look, I don't believe
the unemployed.

204
00:23:56,401 --> 00:23:58,062
So you don't intend
to come out it seems.

205
00:23:58,136 --> 00:24:00,229
No, sir. I've important work to do.

206
00:24:02,073 --> 00:24:06,009
Hey, will you buy me lunch?
Then we'll go to a movie.

207
00:24:06,077 --> 00:24:09,012
A movie again?
- Why, have you already been to one?

208
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,674
I went into a cool place and
started catching up on some sleep...

209
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:14,014
...and suddenly from nowhere
there was this boom.

210
00:24:14,085 --> 00:24:16,019
A bomb! - Another explosion?
- Yes, in the Light House.

211
00:24:16,087 --> 00:24:21,024
Then the movie got interrupted.
- Was anyone injured?

212
00:24:21,092 --> 00:24:22,684
I didn't see. I walked out
and came over.

213
00:24:22,761 --> 00:24:24,695
In our place there will
be no explosion.

214
00:24:24,763 --> 00:24:26,697
Oh! It's your film club.

215
00:24:26,765 --> 00:24:29,199
A Swedish film. No cutting.

216
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:54,951
Shall we go in?
- We won't get a seat.

217
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,385
Come, let's go in and see.

218
00:26:13,004 --> 00:26:15,165
Let's go.

219
00:26:21,012 --> 00:26:23,913
Without my watch,
I can't keep track of the time.

220
00:26:23,982 --> 00:26:26,007
Why? Are you in a hurry
to go somewhere?

221
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:28,018
I've to meet Naresh Pal.

222
00:26:28,853 --> 00:26:31,344
Are you trying to get into politics?

223
00:26:33,024 --> 00:26:35,015
Only that's not included.

224
00:26:35,293 --> 00:26:36,692
Then why go to brother Naresh?

225
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:39,025
His friend seems to have a
pharmaceuticals company...

226
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:42,032
...and probably is hiring people.
He'll give me a letter.

227
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,034
Let me see.

228
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:46,866
I don't understand your situation
at all. Your sister got a job...

229
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:49,031
...but you're not able to find one.

230
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:53,043
Have you seen my sister?
- Have I not?

231
00:26:53,712 --> 00:26:56,704
Then? Why wouldn't she get a job?

232
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:59,716
Academic qualification is
not the only qualification.

233
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:04,052
In that case what is wrong with
your personality? It has...

234
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:06,989
...the stamp of intelligence.
- Who wants intelligence?

235
00:27:07,058 --> 00:27:09,151
You understand everything
and pretend to be a fool.

236
00:27:09,227 --> 00:27:11,195
These days the weaker sex
is the stronger sex.

237
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:14,264
Have you seen how confidently
they walk?

238
00:27:15,166 --> 00:27:16,656
There you're right.

239
00:27:16,735 --> 00:27:18,669
At times they give us
an inferiority complex.

240
00:27:18,737 --> 00:27:24,175
Do you know? If I do something
then I'll get a job.

241
00:27:26,044 --> 00:27:29,343
I have to answer the questions in
the interview in a calculated manner.

242
00:27:31,349 --> 00:27:33,317
To date I haven't done
those calculations.

243
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:37,181
From now on I'll do that.

244
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:44,019
For the last year
I've had these doubts.

245
00:27:44,095 --> 00:27:47,121
I was only waiting for proof.

246
00:27:47,198 --> 00:27:50,895
If I hadn't gotten proof then
I wouldn't have come to you.

247
00:27:50,969 --> 00:27:56,373
I have come so that you
can know about it.

248
00:27:57,709 --> 00:28:01,201
I don't know what impression you've
gotten about your daughter.

249
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:04,715
I don't know how you've
brought her up.

250
00:28:10,055 --> 00:28:14,651
She has destroyed my house, my
family and shattered it.

251
00:28:20,899 --> 00:28:26,667
I've endured this enough. No more.
I can't. I can't bear it...

252
00:28:26,738 --> 00:28:30,174
...anymore. Whatever it may be,
you  find a solution for this.

253
00:28:30,241 --> 00:28:37,670
Otherwise I will have to do
something about it myself.

254
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:46,683
What's the matter?

255
00:28:53,198 --> 00:28:54,688
Why are all of you so gloomy?

256
00:28:55,033 --> 00:28:57,024
Is your interview over?
- Forget my interview.

257
00:28:57,102 --> 00:28:59,297
Who was that woman?

258
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:02,700
Mama!

259
00:29:04,809 --> 00:29:06,970
Who?
- Ask him.

260
00:29:07,045 --> 00:29:08,979
Uncle.

261
00:29:09,814 --> 00:29:14,649
Mrs. Sanyal. - Who is she? - Wife
of Topu's boss, who else?

262
00:29:16,988 --> 00:29:18,649
Did she come complaining about her?

263
00:29:18,723 --> 00:29:20,247
It's ten and still she is not home.
What else will she do?

264
00:29:20,325 --> 00:29:22,657
Does that mean that she's doing
something with her boss?

265
00:29:22,727 --> 00:29:24,661
It could be the pressure of work.

266
00:29:24,729 --> 00:29:26,993
If there is the pressure of work
then why doesn't she inform us...

267
00:29:27,065 --> 00:29:29,158
...when she's leaving the office?

268
00:29:29,234 --> 00:29:35,002
How long can a woman wait alone?

269
00:29:35,073 --> 00:29:37,007
That is different. But if you tell
me that you believe that...

270
00:29:37,075 --> 00:29:40,272
neurotic woman, then I will
portray a different character.

271
00:29:40,678 --> 00:29:43,670
Just like that a woman can walk
in and talk all rubbish...

272
00:29:43,748 --> 00:29:46,683
...about my sister, this
will not be tolerated.

273
00:29:46,751 --> 00:29:49,015
I'm telling you all one more thing.
Don't bring up this...

274
00:29:49,087 --> 00:29:51,180
...topic at all when Topu
comes back from work.

275
00:29:51,256 --> 00:29:53,019
All these problems come
looking for us. That is no evidence.

276
00:30:58,089 --> 00:31:00,250
Now the boss's wife comes
complaining about her.

277
00:31:00,325 --> 00:31:02,088
It is all because of you. If the
daughter has some pressure...

278
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,355
...then what is the son's excuse?
Can't he come home early?

279
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:07,027
Maybe he is going for his studies.

280
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:12,295
But all I know is that he
has stopped his studies.

281
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:18,202
Still he may be doing some studies.
He was the best boy in his class.

282
00:31:18,276 --> 00:31:21,837
He will not remain the best boy for long.

283
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:27,208
Politics is not for students.
There is a time for everything.

284
00:31:29,787 --> 00:31:32,881
You stay in the house
because you like it.

285
00:32:13,031 --> 00:32:15,022
What happened?

286
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:19,862
You had an interview?

287
00:32:25,877 --> 00:32:27,868
Tell me how it went.

288
00:32:28,046 --> 00:32:29,877
I will not.

289
00:32:31,049 --> 00:32:32,880
Tell me.

290
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:38,051
Why were you late coming
home today? - I will not tell.

291
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:43,059
My not telling you and
your telling are not the same.

292
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:45,721
No one comes here and
spreads scandal about me.

293
00:32:46,898 --> 00:32:50,061
Oh! What did that woman say?

294
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:54,067
Did you know that woman would come?
- No.

295
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:58,074
I've heard about her and know what
type of a woman she is. - I see.

296
00:32:58,142 --> 00:32:59,734
What did she say, let me know.

297
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:02,405
I only heard the last
of it and that's enough.

298
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,744
Don't you know what was discussed?
- No, and that is not the issue.

299
00:33:08,753 --> 00:33:10,687
How would I know?
I'm not responsible.

300
00:33:10,755 --> 00:33:12,017
Are you not responsible?

301
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:14,024
Not at all.

302
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:18,852
Okay. You may not be the
person to blame but...

303
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:22,195
...someone is to blame
which you're not disclosing.

304
00:33:22,266 --> 00:33:24,359
But if he is responsible
then straighten it out.

305
00:33:24,435 --> 00:33:26,027
How?
- There are many ways to do that.

306
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:33,033
For example he can be
given a good thrashing.

307
00:33:33,111 --> 00:33:35,102
I feel like laughing
when you talk of thrashing.

308
00:33:39,784 --> 00:33:42,719
You don't have to laugh now,
I'm dead serious.

309
00:33:42,787 --> 00:33:45,051
What's the advantage in thrashing
an innocent person like him?

310
00:33:45,123 --> 00:33:48,058
Innocent! A manager in such a
big private firm and innocent?

311
00:33:48,126 --> 00:33:49,889
Whom are you fooling?

312
00:33:50,795 --> 00:33:53,059
Okay, then do whatever you like.

313
00:33:57,902 --> 00:33:59,733
Aren't you feeling bad about it at all?

314
00:33:59,804 --> 00:34:00,896
Can't you see how ugly the issue is?

315
00:34:00,972 --> 00:34:04,066
Aren't you able to sense how
mama must be feeling about it?

316
00:34:04,142 --> 00:34:06,076
Does mama want me to leave the job?

317
00:34:06,744 --> 00:34:11,010
Naturally. Anyway, the job keeps
you working till ten at night.

318
00:34:13,184 --> 00:34:14,344
...you must leave that job anyhow.

319
00:34:14,419 --> 00:34:16,182
Today the office closed at
five thirty. - Five thirty?

320
00:34:16,254 --> 00:34:21,021
Yes, He took me to
Narendrapur to see his new house.

321
00:34:21,092 --> 00:34:24,027
He, meaning your boss?
- Yes. - Why?

322
00:34:24,762 --> 00:34:27,697
There were three others with us.

323
00:34:27,765 --> 00:34:29,699
Why did you go to see that house?

324
00:34:29,767 --> 00:34:31,701
What do you mean by why?
He called me so I went.

325
00:34:31,769 --> 00:34:34,203
After a hard day's work?

326
00:34:36,874 --> 00:34:39,104
What can I do? - What do
you mean by what you can do?

327
00:34:41,779 --> 00:34:43,872
Can't you refuse to go?
- No.

328
00:34:44,782 --> 00:34:49,219
What do you mean by no? Is
it some slavery or compulsion?

329
00:34:50,388 --> 00:34:55,382
Starting next month I'm becoming
the boss's PA. 200 rupees increment.

330
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:59,894
The rascal is taking advantage of that.

331
00:35:00,064 --> 00:35:03,056
That bloody son of a pig and a scoundrel.

332
00:35:03,134 --> 00:35:04,226
Brother!

333
00:35:04,735 --> 00:35:08,171
Brother, what a beautiful bird this is.

334
00:35:10,007 --> 00:35:11,167
Where?

335
00:35:14,745 --> 00:35:16,736
There!

336
00:35:23,754 --> 00:35:25,745
Wonderful!

337
00:35:25,823 --> 00:35:29,020
What's the name of that bird?

338
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:33,196
Let me freshen up first. I'll
take exactly five minutes.

339
00:35:37,101 --> 00:35:39,763
Don't get worked up over everything.
- Okay.

340
00:35:39,837 --> 00:35:42,863
Tell me first, how was the interview?

341
00:35:43,774 --> 00:35:46,038
Horrible.

342
00:35:49,113 --> 00:35:51,104
Topu?

343
00:35:52,884 --> 00:35:54,875
Is  your boss staying in Alipore?

344
00:35:55,219 --> 00:35:57,050
I won't say.

345
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:19,006
What happened?
- Nothing.

346
00:36:20,077 --> 00:36:23,012
A fight.

347
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:30,082
Do you have a cut?
- Something like that.

348
00:36:48,306 --> 00:36:49,705
Listen.

349
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:54,034
Do you have some money?

350
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:56,877
Why?
- I need it.

351
00:36:57,782 --> 00:36:59,716
What for?

352
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:05,716
I have to finish someone.
An antisocial element.

353
00:37:06,824 --> 00:37:09,987
Why ask me? Go and make your own.

354
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:14,824
It is necessary. Otherwise
the crisis will worsen.

355
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:18,835
Crisis!
- Nothing political.

356
00:37:20,004 --> 00:37:22,996
You have become strange.

357
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:25,008
Always searching for a job has
turned your life into something.

358
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:26,839
Let me do what I'm doing.

359
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:29,004
Have I ever lectured on
anything concerning you?

360
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,874
Do you remember this?

361
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:38,848
You gave this to me.

362
00:37:44,362 --> 00:37:46,853
You don't know that I had to
sell two medical books to buy this.

363
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:51,030
You don't know how much
you've changed in these two years.

364
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:55,698
Two years ago I didn't need a job. 
- Job?

365
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:58,037
Do you know what will be
your condition if you get a job?

366
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:03,103
I will be a copier in
the bureaucratic machine.

367
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:05,806
I feel when I think about that.

368
00:38:06,717 --> 00:38:09,151
You know very well what
you're doing is not correct.

369
00:38:10,321 --> 00:38:12,983
Getting a job is not my ambition.

370
00:38:13,057 --> 00:38:16,823
But can one only follow a single path?

371
00:38:16,894 --> 00:38:18,987
Exactly, that is what is required.

372
00:38:19,063 --> 00:38:20,223
You don't have a path at all.

373
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:22,163
You yourself don't know
which way you want to go.

374
00:38:22,233 --> 00:38:24,827
You're standing in one place
and wasting your time chatting.

375
00:39:26,063 --> 00:39:27,826
Tonu.

376
00:39:30,735 --> 00:39:33,169
Do you remember that bird?

377
00:39:34,739 --> 00:39:37,833
Bird!
- Let it be.

378
00:39:39,744 --> 00:39:41,735
You're not supposed to know it.

379
00:40:14,779 --> 00:40:18,215
Whom do you want?
- Is Mr. Sanyal home?

380
00:40:18,282 --> 00:40:19,874
This slip...
- Okay.

381
00:41:02,827 --> 00:41:04,761
Come inside and sit down.

382
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,751
Why are you standing? Sit down.

383
00:42:08,759 --> 00:42:12,354
Are you Sutopa's brother?
- Yes.

384
00:42:14,765 --> 00:42:17,199
Is she sick?

385
00:42:18,769 --> 00:42:22,205
No, but she is feeling the strain.

386
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:25,774
Feeling the strain?

387
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:27,700
Yes.

388
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:30,313
Your sis, she says that she
is feeling the strain?

389
00:42:31,782 --> 00:42:35,047
No, but we can tell.

390
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:37,710
She is getting frail.

391
00:42:39,123 --> 00:42:42,718
But I didn't notice that.

392
00:42:42,793 --> 00:42:46,889
You always see her
hence you may not have noticed.

393
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:49,893
Doesn't the word 'always'
sound a little aggressive?

394
00:42:50,801 --> 00:42:53,235
Anyway, we can tell.

395
00:42:58,809 --> 00:43:01,744
Whatever you're trying to
say if you don't say it...

396
00:43:01,812 --> 00:43:04,246
...clearly it's difficult
to understand.

397
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:18,851
She never told me that
she is feeling the strain.

398
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:21,856
In fact, she seems quite happy.

399
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:27,700
She is very smart, hard
working. As for overtime...

400
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:32,708
...she may have had to do it for a
few days, that I don't deny...

401
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:36,109
...but doing it for more
than one hour, I don't think so.

402
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:45,778
Have you gotten a job?

403
00:43:54,898 --> 00:43:56,729
Instead of your sister
leaving her job wouldn't...

404
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,064
...it be better that you find a job?

405
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:01,900
In your company.

406
00:44:02,806 --> 00:44:05,206
No, I can recommend somewhere else.

407
00:44:06,844 --> 00:44:10,007
You sit down. I'm due to
get a trunk call at ten.

408
00:44:10,748 --> 00:44:12,841
You wait and I'll give you a letter.

409
00:44:39,877 --> 00:44:44,041
Who? Yes, I'm well.

410
00:44:44,782 --> 00:44:50,084
Hello. This is me, Sanyal speaking.

411
00:44:50,788 --> 00:44:53,052
Yes. Oh no.

412
00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:56,052
I've told him already.

413
00:44:57,795 --> 00:44:59,729
Everything is settled.

414
00:45:30,194 --> 00:45:33,027
Catch that fellow.

415
00:45:34,765 --> 00:45:38,030
He hit the child.

416
00:45:39,770 --> 00:45:43,035
Catch him and beat him.

417
00:46:30,854 --> 00:46:32,845
Why did you stop
studying to be a doctor?

418
00:46:32,923 --> 00:46:35,187
There was problem in the house.

419
00:46:36,026 --> 00:46:41,191
Naresh has written to
medical representatives...

420
00:46:42,766 --> 00:46:44,859
...but there are no vacancies for medical
representatives at present. We...

421
00:46:46,770 --> 00:46:49,204
...are taking salesmen. - Salesman! - 
It seems your heart is sad.

422
00:46:50,107 --> 00:46:52,871
I started as a salesman myself.

423
00:46:53,043 --> 00:46:56,035
If you work properly there is always 
the opportunity to prosper in a job.

424
00:46:58,782 --> 00:47:01,876
Are you thinking that
you're to carry medicines...

425
00:47:01,952 --> 00:47:03,886
...in a bag and move like a hawker?
- Is that not so?

426
00:47:05,722 --> 00:47:07,314
No, it's not like that.

427
00:47:07,391 --> 00:47:11,657
Actually what you've to do 
is go to hospitals...

428
00:47:11,728 --> 00:47:14,822
...and dispensaries and note down
their requirements in a note book.

429
00:47:15,065 --> 00:47:18,660
There is a lot of traveling.

430
00:47:18,735 --> 00:47:22,000
From a central place
you travel around 70 to 80 miles daily.

431
00:47:26,076 --> 00:47:30,012
Where is the place?

432
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:32,674
Balurghat. Do you know?
It's in west Dinajpur.

433
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:41,087
The fact is that I don't want
to leave Calcutta at present.

434
00:47:41,158 --> 00:47:46,858
That you decide. I can give you
around ten days to make up your mind.

435
00:47:51,768 --> 00:47:54,032
Yes, Siddartha.

436
00:47:57,774 --> 00:48:02,211
It seems you have left
everything at its pace.

437
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:07,714
What to say? It seems that
I'm to leave Calcutta at last.

438
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:12,814
Why are you bothered about that?

439
00:48:13,323 --> 00:48:15,655
You say that you like it outside Calcutta.

440
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:17,819
That is when I go to
places like Deohargh...

441
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:21,664
...and spend a vacation
there for 15 to 20 days.

442
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:24,667
But this is not like that.

443
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:28,068
It is some corner of the world...

444
00:48:28,138 --> 00:48:30,072
...and that too as a medical
salesman. I don't like it.

445
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:32,734
I don't know about you but...

446
00:48:33,176 --> 00:48:38,170
...I can't even stay for
a minute outside Calcutta.

447
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:40,683
I know.

448
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:47,690
There is something about the city.

449
00:48:49,092 --> 00:48:50,855
Tell me what it is?

450
00:48:51,028 --> 00:48:53,861
It's life.

451
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:56,024
It may be a tough life but we like it.

452
00:48:57,100 --> 00:49:02,868
In other places either
you're dead or you're burnt out.

453
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:06,635
What a condition. When I think of
leaving Calcutta I feel sick...

454
00:49:06,710 --> 00:49:09,304
...however they will
not permit us to stay here.

455
00:49:10,714 --> 00:49:13,649
Tunu is right.

456
00:49:14,718 --> 00:49:16,982
There is no way out
other than a revolution.

457
00:49:17,721 --> 00:49:20,986
You will start a revolution.
- No, I will not but...

458
00:49:21,058 --> 00:49:23,822
...if it starts then I will fight in it.

459
00:49:24,161 --> 00:49:27,824
Will you fire a gun? Will
you throw hand grenades?

460
00:49:28,065 --> 00:49:32,058
At times when my head gets hot...

461
00:49:33,737 --> 00:49:37,173
...then I think that I should do all that.
