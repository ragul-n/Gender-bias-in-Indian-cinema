1
00:01:13,829 --> 00:01:14,924
In this world,

2
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:18,690
No one knows who, when, 
where and why we meet people,

3
00:01:18,938 --> 00:01:20,106
except God.

4
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:24,838
That meeting can be a boon to 
someone and a curse to some others.

5
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:26,342
Because,

6
00:01:26,734 --> 00:01:31,527
the path that we think we chose 
is the play of the destiny.

7
00:01:33,191 --> 00:01:34,267
[clanks]

8
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:37,463
Yeah!

9
00:02:21,096 --> 00:02:22,689
Lakshmi...

10
00:02:22,937 --> 00:02:26,635
It's me who won... It's me who won...

11
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,929
-La... lala... laalaa... 
-Hey Chinna!

12
00:02:28,074 --> 00:02:30,218
How many times should I tell you 
not to get drenched in the rain?

13
00:02:31,315 --> 00:02:31,972
-You do this all the time. 
-Mother...

14
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:33,174
-Leave it. 
-You'll catch a cold now.

15
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:34,370
-Nothing would happen to me. 
-You'll get fever.

16
00:02:34,462 --> 00:02:35,515
-Ow! Lakshmi... 
-Oh!

17
00:02:45,984 --> 00:02:48,187
There is nothing to worry. 
It is a minor wound.

18
00:02:49,081 --> 00:02:52,319
But ensure that the head doesn't 
get in contact with water.

19
00:02:53,526 --> 00:02:57,219
I'm prescribing some medicines. 
Get them immediately.

20
00:02:58,134 --> 00:02:59,152
-You can go, son. 
-Okay, sir.

21
00:03:01,184 --> 00:03:03,482
-Next. Tell me. 
-Sit here.

22
00:03:05,224 --> 00:03:09,584
[thunders rumbling]

23
00:03:18,217 --> 00:03:21,769
[thunders rumbling]

24
00:03:22,495 --> 00:03:25,207
Hmm... Leukemia. Advanced stage.

25
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,913
-Please take care of her. 
-Sure, sir.

26
00:03:28,537 --> 00:03:31,505
Look, the patient doesn't 
have much time to survive.

27
00:03:31,602 --> 00:03:33,270
Cancer is in the third stage.

28
00:03:33,824 --> 00:03:35,960
Even the treatment would cost high.

29
00:03:35,996 --> 00:03:36,970
How much would it cost, sir?

30
00:03:37,046 --> 00:03:38,598
It would cost five lakh 
rupees approximately.

31
00:03:38,765 --> 00:03:40,693
Moreover, 
we don't have such advanced technology.

32
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:43,174
We got to shift the patient 
to a bigger hospital.

33
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:46,147
So, you better decide quickly and tell us.

34
00:03:54,789 --> 00:04:00,267
[sobbing] Mother...

35
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:07,263
Nothing would happen to your mother, son.

36
00:04:09,647 --> 00:04:10,875
Take care of your mother.

37
00:04:15,816 --> 00:04:19,329
Everyone consoled, but no one helped.

38
00:04:20,037 --> 00:04:21,414
He understood on that day...

39
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:26,615
that it's only the money that has 
value in this world, than words.

40
00:05:05,159 --> 00:05:08,591
Chinna, listen to me carefully.

41
00:05:08,653 --> 00:05:10,021
What is it, Lakshmi?

42
00:05:11,164 --> 00:05:12,595
I won't be there from now.

43
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:15,492
You have to battle your life alone.

44
00:05:16,109 --> 00:05:19,844
-Your Lakshmi won't be with you. 
-Lakshmi, what are you talking?

45
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,061
Nothing would happen to you.

46
00:05:21,253 --> 00:05:23,669
You will always stay by my side.

47
00:05:25,886 --> 00:05:28,526
Yes. I will be with you.

48
00:05:29,434 --> 00:05:31,041
I'll be beside you.

49
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:35,232
I will forever live in 
the help that you do.

50
00:05:35,971 --> 00:05:37,314
Will you promise me something?

51
00:05:37,465 --> 00:05:39,049
What is it, Lakshmi?

52
00:05:44,358 --> 00:05:46,791
When you get an opportunity to help,

53
00:05:48,179 --> 00:05:50,598
just do it without any second thought.

54
00:05:52,338 --> 00:05:56,358
Because, the aid that is done 
when sought is called charity.

55
00:05:57,473 --> 00:06:00,386
But the aid that is done without anyone 
seeking you for it, is called help.

56
00:06:03,358 --> 00:06:05,568
Today, your mother would pass away.

57
00:06:06,693 --> 00:06:09,298
It is not because there is 
no treatment for her disease.

58
00:06:10,336 --> 00:06:12,161
But due to non-availability 
of the medicine called 'help'.

59
00:06:12,713 --> 00:06:17,888
"The words of the mother 
is a book of morals"

60
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:23,457
"The world has forgotten the word help"

61
00:06:23,896 --> 00:06:29,061
"By listening to and being with mother"

62
00:06:29,249 --> 00:06:34,242
"help others and go ahead in life"

63
00:06:34,314 --> 00:06:39,558
"This is how life is. 
We have our own journey"

64
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:45,998
-"No one would come with you till the end" 
-Lakshmi... Lakshmi...

65
00:06:46,119 --> 00:06:51,204
"It is you who would be 
with yourself till the end"

66
00:06:51,664 --> 00:06:54,330
"The words of mother..."

67
00:06:54,406 --> 00:06:55,838
Brother... Brother... 
My mother passed away.

68
00:06:55,983 --> 00:06:56,697
Go away.

69
00:06:57,533 --> 00:06:58,630
Brother... Brother... 
My mother has passed away.

70
00:06:58,688 --> 00:06:59,701
I don't have money.

71
00:07:01,971 --> 00:07:03,156
Madam... Madam... 
My mother has passed away.

72
00:07:03,216 --> 00:07:04,024
I don't have money to 
arrange for her cremation.

73
00:07:04,181 --> 00:07:05,181
I don't have money. Go away.

74
00:07:05,356 --> 00:07:08,684
[sobs] Mother...

75
00:07:08,804 --> 00:07:12,976
"The world never accompanies you"

76
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:14,220
What happened, brother?

77
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:16,837
My mother passed away. 
I don't have money for her cremation.

78
00:07:22,496 --> 00:07:23,443
Who are you?

79
00:07:24,155 --> 00:07:28,183
I'm Chinna, son of my mother Lakshmi.

80
00:07:28,741 --> 00:07:32,661
My mother told me that the aid that 
is done when sought is called charity.

81
00:07:32,766 --> 00:07:35,523
But the aid that is done without anyone 
seeking you for it, is called help.

82
00:07:35,616 --> 00:07:37,026
My mother has passed away.

83
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:38,877
due to non-availability of 
the medicine called help.

84
00:07:39,866 --> 00:07:42,194
When should I repay 
you if I get the money?

85
00:07:42,201 --> 00:07:46,264
You need not repay me. Just help those 
people who are in need of it like you.

86
00:07:46,339 --> 00:07:48,395
My mother Lakshmi would live in that help.

87
00:07:56,337 --> 00:07:57,728
Johnny Johhny,

88
00:07:57,803 --> 00:08:00,752
Yes, papa. Eating sugar... 
PRESENT DAY IN HYDERABAD OUTSKIRTS

89
00:08:00,928 --> 00:08:01,784
No papa.

90
00:08:01,984 --> 00:08:05,006
Telling lies? No papa.

91
00:08:05,011 --> 00:08:08,099
Open your mouth! Ha... Ha... Ouch!

92
00:08:08,532 --> 00:08:10,362
Johnny Johnny. Yes, papa.

93
00:08:10,422 --> 00:08:11,901
Eating drugs? No, papa.

94
00:08:12,185 --> 00:08:13,853
Where are the drugs? Tell, papa.

95
00:08:13,903 --> 00:08:16,683
I don't know anything, sir. 
I'm just the supplier, sir.

96
00:08:16,756 --> 00:08:18,684
I really don't know who the dealer is, 
sir.

97
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:20,506
-Please believe me, sir. 
-Hey!

98
00:08:21,138 --> 00:08:24,498
My gun and ears should hear only answers.

99
00:08:24,514 --> 00:08:26,408
-I swear on my mother... 
-[gun cocks] No mercy.

100
00:08:26,555 --> 00:08:27,435
I'm telling the truth, sir.

101
00:08:27,535 --> 00:08:29,380
-Please sir. Don't kill me, sir. 
-Five, four, three

102
00:08:29,456 --> 00:08:31,452
-Sir, I'm just a peddler. 
-Two... [gunshot]

103
00:08:41,077 --> 00:08:42,339
[gunfire sound in the mobile] Damn!

104
00:08:43,631 --> 00:08:45,813
-Hey, seems like he would come. 
-Ah?

105
00:08:46,334 --> 00:08:48,437
How dare he address me informally 
despite being the landlord!

106
00:08:48,758 --> 00:08:50,342
I'll take you to task. I'm coming inside.

107
00:08:50,517 --> 00:08:52,489
Yes, seems like he would come inside!

108
00:08:52,819 --> 00:08:55,307
Let that idiot come! 
I'll stab him with the knife.

109
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:58,037
Ouch! Hey, what did I do?

110
00:08:58,197 --> 00:08:59,018
-No, dude. 
-Why?

111
00:08:59,077 --> 00:09:00,021
Ah! Phew!

112
00:09:00,138 --> 00:09:02,230
There might be chances of survival 
when stabbed with a knife.

113
00:09:02,318 --> 00:09:06,097
But if we shoot him with a gun... Bam! 
Bam! He would be dead for sure.

114
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:08,804
Bam! Hey! Hey!

115
00:09:09,084 --> 00:09:10,759
Not even one person have pity on me?

116
00:09:11,059 --> 00:09:11,859
Why do all those things?

117
00:09:12,351 --> 00:09:13,503
Seems like he is the only good person!

118
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:14,538
He is just one person.

119
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:18,021
If we throw the grenade from the bag, 
he will explode into pieces.

120
00:09:18,062 --> 00:09:20,046
Explode into pieces? Oh no! Oh no!

121
00:09:20,778 --> 00:09:22,030
Let me take you to task!

122
00:09:22,886 --> 00:09:24,942
I will catch you red handed on the camera.

123
00:09:25,094 --> 00:09:26,701
Hey, go from that side.

124
00:09:26,793 --> 00:09:29,140
Go from that side. There is just 
one bomb left. We shouldn't miss.

125
00:09:29,331 --> 00:09:31,140
-He should explode. Look, he's coming... 
-What are you planning to kill me?

126
00:09:31,316 --> 00:09:34,508
Overlap of voices: Come on, shoot him! 
He is here! Smash him! Shoot him!

127
00:09:34,509 --> 00:09:36,087
-I plead you, please spare me. 
-Overlap of voices: Come on, shoot him!

128
00:09:36,163 --> 00:09:37,596
It doesn't matter if you don't pay rent.

129
00:09:38,123 --> 00:09:39,587
Yeah... Yeah... Sir...

130
00:09:40,055 --> 00:09:42,175
-What are you doing? 
-Uncle, the thing is that...

131
00:09:42,726 --> 00:09:44,337
-Pub-G 
-You've scared the hell out of me!

132
00:09:44,568 --> 00:09:45,553
We are playing Pub-G game, uncle.

133
00:09:45,613 --> 00:09:47,025
Is it that famous killing game?

134
00:09:47,155 --> 00:09:49,462
-Err... Yes, uncle. 
-We've even won chicken dinner just now.

135
00:09:49,532 --> 00:09:51,410
Then, go and have chicken dinner. Okay?

136
00:09:51,997 --> 00:09:54,000
I've made previous tenants to 
vacate the house and got you here

137
00:09:54,076 --> 00:09:55,389
for doing mischievous things like you.

138
00:09:55,481 --> 00:09:57,085
-In unison: That's not the case. 
-It's just a week that you've come here.

139
00:09:57,261 --> 00:09:57,920
Sorry.

140
00:09:58,056 --> 00:10:01,867
Alright. I'm going out of town. Look 
after the house properly till I return.

141
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:06,677
If you get friends, blah-blah... [snaps] 
I will take each one of you to task.

142
00:10:06,735 --> 00:10:08,187
Eh... We won't get girls and booze...

143
00:10:08,354 --> 00:10:09,166
-We won't. 
-What?

144
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:09,813
I'm sorry.

145
00:10:10,146 --> 00:10:14,098
Hey, take care of the house. 
Behave yourselves till I return.

146
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:16,820
What do you think my name is... 
Devudu... Sahadevudu.

147
00:10:19,374 --> 00:10:23,581
In unison: Winner winner chicken dinner... 
Yeah!

148
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:45,274
"Spiderman, Superman, Ironman"

149
00:10:45,366 --> 00:10:47,435
"and so are we..."

150
00:10:47,823 --> 00:10:51,344
"The three monkeys came"

151
00:10:51,648 --> 00:10:55,025
"to meet you"

152
00:10:55,415 --> 00:10:59,084
"They are the dupes of Mr Bean"

153
00:10:59,286 --> 00:11:02,919
"They are hilarious than Chaplin"

154
00:11:03,052 --> 00:11:06,712
"They are raspier than Pikachu"

155
00:11:07,008 --> 00:11:10,148
"They are lazier and 
crazier monkeys than you"

156
00:11:13,663 --> 00:11:14,537
"Three monkeys"

157
00:11:17,568 --> 00:11:18,488
"Three monkeys"

158
00:11:19,319 --> 00:11:20,443
"Hey-hey"

159
00:11:21,403 --> 00:11:22,038
"Oh-oh"

160
00:11:23,377 --> 00:11:24,017
"Hey-hey"

161
00:11:41,512 --> 00:11:44,771
"You wake up early in the 
morning and make a mess"

162
00:11:45,346 --> 00:11:48,514
"You keep running as if you 
are racing against the time"

163
00:11:49,216 --> 00:11:52,295
"Unable to understand life, 
you get confused"

164
00:11:53,058 --> 00:11:56,312
"You work like a robot and forgot smiling"

165
00:11:56,956 --> 00:12:00,656
"Life lies in laughter"

166
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:04,310
"Let's make everyone laugh and go ahead"

167
00:12:04,508 --> 00:12:08,320
"What's the delay?"

168
00:12:08,424 --> 00:12:11,088
"Come to this movie today"

169
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:15,897
"Three monkeys"

170
00:12:19,035 --> 00:12:19,769
"Three monkeys"

171
00:12:20,849 --> 00:12:21,353
"Hey-hey"

172
00:12:22,773 --> 00:12:23,498
"Oh-oh"

173
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:25,353
"Hey-hey"

174
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:45,902
Congratulations, sir. You've got a year 
old car for seven lakh rupees only.

175
00:12:45,968 --> 00:12:46,941
-Thank you. 
-Congratulations!

176
00:12:48,916 --> 00:12:49,500
[sighs]

177
00:12:56,747 --> 00:12:58,441
[dialer tone rings] Bharat

178
00:12:58,531 --> 00:12:59,868
-Hey, Phani. 
-Tell me.

179
00:13:00,009 --> 00:13:02,333
I'll send you a location on your phone. 
Come there.

180
00:13:02,396 --> 00:13:03,279
What's the matter?

181
00:13:03,671 --> 00:13:05,273
-Surprise! 
-Okay.

182
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:06,089
-Bye. 
-Bye.

183
00:13:11,438 --> 00:13:13,582
[train honks]

184
00:13:13,687 --> 00:13:15,660
Tsk! Where is he?

185
00:13:15,816 --> 00:13:17,836
He asked us to come here 
immediately but he didn't come yet.

186
00:13:18,235 --> 00:13:19,577
He might have encountered 
some bug in his work.

187
00:13:19,677 --> 00:13:20,955
He won't come unless he resolves it.

188
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:23,362
Well... a software job is 
really a tough one, right?

189
00:13:23,955 --> 00:13:27,024
No proper food, no proper sleep. 
There would be nothing.

190
00:13:27,118 --> 00:13:29,743
It has soft in its spelling 
but life is very tough in it.

191
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:32,623
You are right dude. 
They earn more but have a miserable life.

192
00:13:32,809 --> 00:13:35,444
They keep repeatedly telling 
childhood things. Hell with them!

193
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,158
They would 'you are on bench', 
'your worksheet is less'.

194
00:13:37,282 --> 00:13:38,058
Who is he?

195
00:13:38,181 --> 00:13:39,152
Whose car is this?

196
00:13:39,867 --> 00:13:40,631
-Hey! 
-Hey!

197
00:13:40,804 --> 00:13:41,425
Anand!

198
00:13:42,294 --> 00:13:43,384
-Hey... 
-He is our guy!

199
00:13:43,528 --> 00:13:45,142
-What's this? 
-Oh my!

200
00:13:45,468 --> 00:13:47,574
What's with this getup? 
What's with this car?

201
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:50,691
I bought a new dress to match the car.

202
00:13:51,822 --> 00:13:53,085
It is our new used-car.

203
00:13:53,176 --> 00:13:54,536
-New used-car? 
-Huh!

204
00:13:54,636 --> 00:13:57,239
It was a new car to its owner six months 
ago. But now it is an old car for us.

205
00:13:57,373 --> 00:13:59,118
Hey, don't say it as new used-car.

206
00:13:59,394 --> 00:14:00,971
It is shining vibrantly 
like moonlight in the dark.

207
00:14:01,051 --> 00:14:02,887
-He tied ribbon very well. 
-It's like shooting-car.

208
00:14:03,087 --> 00:14:04,939
-Wow! Beautiful! 
-Superb!

209
00:14:04,999 --> 00:14:06,090
-Yes, dude! 
-Wonderful!

210
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:08,970
That's why I bought this 
car with all my savings.

211
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:11,603
Well, 
your dream of buying a car is fulfilled.

212
00:14:11,979 --> 00:14:14,083
Look Santosh, 
buying a car is not my dream.

213
00:14:14,597 --> 00:14:16,209
I should make my mother sit 
in the front seat of the car

214
00:14:16,301 --> 00:14:18,299
and drive her the through 
entire city like a queen.

215
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:20,464
When I see happiness in 
her eyes at that time,

216
00:14:20,533 --> 00:14:22,816
Then, I'll be fully satisfied 
about buying the car.

217
00:14:22,876 --> 00:14:25,257
Hey, take a selfie and send 
it to your mother immediately.

218
00:14:25,437 --> 00:14:26,267
It is a good idea, dude.

219
00:14:29,334 --> 00:14:31,331
[hums]

220
00:14:31,477 --> 00:14:32,145
-Come here. 
-Okay.

221
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:35,275
-Go ahead, dude. 
-Come in the frame, guys!

222
00:14:35,523 --> 00:14:39,067
Hey, your mother would feel 
happy if you send her your photo.

223
00:14:39,267 --> 00:14:41,836
Hey, my mother would just feel happy 
if I just click my pic with it.

224
00:14:41,928 --> 00:14:43,948
But she will feel content 
if it is three of us.

225
00:14:45,015 --> 00:14:45,718
Come, guys.

226
00:14:45,726 --> 00:14:48,014
-Come on, take a groofie. (group-selfie) 
-Yeah. Yo!

227
00:14:48,093 --> 00:14:50,551
Cheese. [camera clicks]

228
00:14:52,546 --> 00:14:53,916
-Where is the party, dude? 
-Party?

229
00:14:54,124 --> 00:14:55,404
Where and what do you want?

230
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:57,876
-Hmm... Shall we go to a pub? 
-Sure.

231
00:14:58,245 --> 00:15:01,017
Hey, who will allow singles like us, 
inside?

232
00:15:01,076 --> 00:15:04,112
Hey, who would stop us when 
we're having this new used-car?

233
00:15:04,212 --> 00:15:06,106
Watch now, my amassing marketing!

234
00:15:06,206 --> 00:15:08,138
-It is 'amazing', not amassing. Come on. 
-Let's go.

235
00:15:08,167 --> 00:15:09,423
It is a new used-car. Sit properly.

236
00:15:20,523 --> 00:15:23,356
Wow! Hey... What a gorgeous chick she is!

237
00:15:25,782 --> 00:15:27,661
She is amazing in all the angles.

238
00:15:27,828 --> 00:15:29,756
We have a car. 
Do you think she would come with us?

239
00:15:29,949 --> 00:15:30,951
-Why are you so late? 
-Sorry, baby.

240
00:15:31,051 --> 00:15:32,348
-How much time should I wait? 
-I'm late due to heavy traffic.

241
00:15:32,453 --> 00:15:33,868
Sorry. Let's go.

242
00:15:33,932 --> 00:15:36,185
She is already taken... by him.

243
00:15:39,549 --> 00:15:42,004
Alright. 
It's getting late, let's go inside.

244
00:15:42,677 --> 00:15:44,516
[hums] Ahem...

245
00:15:45,591 --> 00:15:46,333
Where are you going?

246
00:15:49,173 --> 00:15:49,882
To there.

247
00:15:49,951 --> 00:15:50,817
What about the girl?

248
00:15:52,395 --> 00:15:54,319
-We have a car. 
-Get into that car and leave.

249
00:15:54,379 --> 00:15:55,322
Bad joke.

250
00:15:57,278 --> 00:15:58,155
[snifles]

251
00:15:58,343 --> 00:16:02,194
-Brother, adjust for this time. 
-Hmm...

252
00:16:03,014 --> 00:16:04,327
Please... But still, a girl is needed.

253
00:16:04,527 --> 00:16:06,543
-Phew! 
-Is it tough?

254
00:16:07,228 --> 00:16:08,619
Bro, are you aware of surveys?

255
00:16:09,247 --> 00:16:12,062
-Only 93 women are there for 100 men. 
-Hmm...

256
00:16:12,398 --> 00:16:13,566
We are the other three guys 
out the remaining seven.

257
00:16:13,815 --> 00:16:14,475
Our batch!

258
00:16:14,622 --> 00:16:15,726
Please adjust and let us in.

259
00:16:15,844 --> 00:16:16,477
Come, I've talked to him.

260
00:16:16,758 --> 00:16:17,862
-Okay. 
-Hey, stop.

261
00:16:17,934 --> 00:16:20,712
-Whoa! Whoa! 
-Okay

262
00:16:20,782 --> 00:16:21,653
Do something.

263
00:16:21,723 --> 00:16:23,606
-What is it? 
-Three of you, just get one girl.

264
00:16:23,644 --> 00:16:24,288
I will let you go inside.

265
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:27,056
-I know a girl. 
-Who is it that I don't know?

266
00:16:27,156 --> 00:16:27,639
Who is she?

267
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:28,533
Come with me, I'll show you.

268
00:16:30,956 --> 00:16:32,596
-We'll be back in 5 minutes with a girl. 
-Wait, papa.

269
00:16:32,717 --> 00:16:33,706
-New sunglasses. 
-Keep waiting.

270
00:16:35,212 --> 00:16:36,672
Brother, keep the shutter open.

271
00:16:37,607 --> 00:16:38,206
[car unlocks]

272
00:16:39,261 --> 00:16:39,804
Hey... Hey... [tyres screech]

273
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:42,378
That's the girl.

274
00:16:44,214 --> 00:16:45,006
The flower seller?

275
00:16:45,692 --> 00:16:48,210
Hey, look at her from my angle.

276
00:16:59,942 --> 00:17:00,880
Will she come with us?

277
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:01,996
Hey!

278
00:17:03,035 --> 00:17:05,294
Give me two minutes. 
I'll convince and bring her.

279
00:17:05,988 --> 00:17:06,801
Go... Go... Go...

280
00:17:15,195 --> 00:17:16,021
Where to?

281
00:17:16,221 --> 00:17:19,403
Ah! Haha... Look there.

282
00:17:28,609 --> 00:17:29,576
It is wonderful, isn't it?

283
00:17:29,895 --> 00:17:30,750
Hey Raji

284
00:17:31,781 --> 00:17:32,321
She?

285
00:17:33,939 --> 00:17:34,690
What are you doing here?

286
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:37,750
They said they'd pay me 3000 rupees if 
I'd accompany them to the pub, cousin.

287
00:17:37,809 --> 00:17:41,009
Go home. I'll take you to task. 
Bugger off from here.

288
00:17:42,331 --> 00:17:44,191
I think it is a family problem. I'm going.

289
00:17:45,012 --> 00:17:45,651
I told you to stop, didn't I?

290
00:17:46,688 --> 00:17:47,358
I've paid no?

291
00:17:48,118 --> 00:17:48,646
Ow!

292
00:17:52,033 --> 00:17:52,610
Cheers!

293
00:18:02,244 --> 00:18:08,045
[laughs]

294
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:10,696
They have hit him on his eye!

295
00:18:13,121 --> 00:18:14,959
Damn! Are you any friends?

296
00:18:15,199 --> 00:18:16,469
Will you laugh when a friend gets hit?

297
00:18:16,591 --> 00:18:17,331
Aren't you ashamed?

298
00:18:17,367 --> 00:18:19,650
Is it? Who gave this stupid idea?

299
00:18:19,858 --> 00:18:20,864
-Ah? 
-This guy!

300
00:18:21,239 --> 00:18:24,692
You've blabbered 
'look at her from my angle'!

301
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,225
That he was hit hard on his eye.

302
00:18:28,613 --> 00:18:31,107
Hey, why do you sound it 
as if I did it for myself?

303
00:18:31,346 --> 00:18:32,755
I did that so that everyone 
could go to the pub, right?

304
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:35,555
Anyhow, I think we don't 
have any way to enter a pub.

305
00:18:35,654 --> 00:18:37,222
Hey! Don't be sad!

306
00:18:37,273 --> 00:18:38,950
Anyhow, wherever we are, we make it a pub.

307
00:18:39,046 --> 00:18:41,402
Yeah! Booze exists both there and here!

308
00:18:41,664 --> 00:18:42,604
Do you want music?

309
00:18:42,834 --> 00:18:44,515
Yes. What about the girl then?

310
00:18:46,082 --> 00:18:47,281
Phew!

311
00:18:48,088 --> 00:18:49,052
Do you want a girl?

312
00:18:49,073 --> 00:18:50,636
Girl? Yes.

313
00:18:50,873 --> 00:18:52,049
How can you get a girl at this time?

314
00:18:52,282 --> 00:18:53,345
Do you want a girl?

315
00:18:53,445 --> 00:18:54,456
In unison: Yes, we do.

316
00:18:55,661 --> 00:18:56,508
Dirty picture!

317
00:18:57,034 --> 00:18:58,432
Five minutes.

318
00:18:58,684 --> 00:19:00,225
Just wait. Don't make haste!

319
00:19:00,515 --> 00:19:02,834
-Don't open the beers. I will get the girl 
-Why is he saying that he'd get a girl?

320
00:19:02,934 --> 00:19:04,231
-Even I'm not getting him. 
-Wait.

321
00:19:12,379 --> 00:19:15,360
"Why do you want to go to a pub, dude? 
We have our terrace!"

322
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:18,638
"Why do you want a girl, dude? 
It is a waste of money"

323
00:19:19,085 --> 00:19:21,930
"Why do you want to go to a pub, dude? 
We have our terrace!"

324
00:19:22,301 --> 00:19:25,253
"Why do you want a girl, dude? 
It is a waste of money"

325
00:19:25,745 --> 00:19:28,970
"Shall we booze and rock the party?"

326
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:32,016
"Shall we dance and celebrate 
the wedding procession?"

327
00:19:32,304 --> 00:19:35,521
"Shall we rock the party by boozing?"

328
00:19:35,596 --> 00:19:38,662
"Shall we dance and celebrate 
the wedding procession?"

329
00:19:38,712 --> 00:19:41,553
"Come on, bro. 
Drink up, me hearties, yo ho"

330
00:19:42,247 --> 00:19:45,435
"Why do you want to go to a pub, dude? 
We have our terrace!"

331
00:19:45,703 --> 00:19:48,344
"Why do you want a girl, dude? 
It is a waste of money"

332
00:19:48,444 --> 00:19:48,905
"You are right"

333
00:19:49,005 --> 00:19:51,673
"Why do you want to go to a pub, dude? 
We have our terrace!"

334
00:19:52,551 --> 00:19:53,914
"Why do you want a girl, dude?"

335
00:19:55,753 --> 00:19:57,272
"Why do you want a girl, dude?"

336
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:00,816
"Hey... Hey... 
Why do you want to go to a pub, dude?"

337
00:20:02,078 --> 00:20:04,167
"Hey... Hey... 
Why do you want a girl, dude?"

338
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:06,787
"Pub... Girl..."

339
00:20:07,053 --> 00:20:08,388
" Girl... Pub..."

340
00:20:08,723 --> 00:20:13,420
"Pub... Girl... Girl... Pub... Pub... 
Girl... Girl... Pub... They're just waste"

341
00:20:15,104 --> 00:20:17,502
Look Komali, 
a flower isn't fragrant once it blooms.

342
00:20:17,917 --> 00:20:18,701
You didn't get it, right?

343
00:20:18,886 --> 00:20:20,292
-I'll explain it in our language. 
-Okay.

344
00:20:20,428 --> 00:20:21,955
The project won't get completed 
once you finish writing the code.

345
00:20:22,199 --> 00:20:26,546
There would be testing, bugs, 
production and many more.

346
00:20:26,886 --> 00:20:28,787
Hmm... To put it in simple words,

347
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:33,298
Software is as easy as sitting at the 
C(sea), sipping Java(drink), saying OOPS.

348
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:36,500
The software was a new thing during 
its advent. But it became old, right?

349
00:20:36,585 --> 00:20:37,277
Even, you are the same.

350
00:20:37,639 --> 00:20:38,180
Okay?

351
00:20:38,446 --> 00:20:43,479
If you have any doubts in Java, 
C, C++ and C-,

352
00:20:43,553 --> 00:20:44,940
Okay... Come to my home.

353
00:20:45,052 --> 00:20:46,120
-Eh? 
-I mean...

354
00:20:46,254 --> 00:20:47,834
The software company is like our home, 
right?

355
00:20:47,973 --> 00:20:48,986
-So, come to home. 
-[lady clears throat]

356
00:20:49,059 --> 00:20:49,687
Understand?

357
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:57,776
As the alphabets aren't in the order on 
a keyboard, I'm clarifying her doubts.

358
00:20:57,976 --> 00:20:59,432
-Oh! Go! 
-She is new, right?

359
00:21:01,267 --> 00:21:03,000
There aren't in order. 
We ought to put them.

360
00:21:06,793 --> 00:21:08,704
-Be careful with him. 
-Yes, ma'am.

361
00:21:15,788 --> 00:21:16,822
I'm still here.

362
00:21:16,957 --> 00:21:18,383
Well the seat isn't comfortable.

363
00:21:19,818 --> 00:21:21,371
-Huh! 
-I'm adjusting it.

364
00:21:21,881 --> 00:21:23,309
-Come to my cabin. 
-Huh?

365
00:21:23,789 --> 00:21:24,501
Okay.

366
00:21:32,738 --> 00:21:33,836
May I come in, madam?

367
00:21:35,282 --> 00:21:38,089
Oh God! Why is she pointing finger? 
Don't know what she would say.

368
00:21:48,956 --> 00:21:49,686
What are you doing?

369
00:21:50,549 --> 00:21:52,232
-I didn't see anything, madam. 
-What?

370
00:21:54,669 --> 00:21:55,954
The client deliverables have been late.

371
00:21:56,601 --> 00:21:59,119
You said you'd finish it by yesterday. 
What happened?

372
00:21:59,475 --> 00:22:02,376
I've resolved three bugs last night.

373
00:22:03,651 --> 00:22:05,855
Another bug showed up in the morning, 
madam.

374
00:22:06,409 --> 00:22:08,777
I'll finish it by tonight by all means, 
madam.

375
00:22:09,106 --> 00:22:10,125
I'm fed up.

376
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,092
I don't know what you are doing.

377
00:22:12,413 --> 00:22:13,816
You are saying this everytime.

378
00:22:13,939 --> 00:22:15,638
If this repeats again,

379
00:22:15,949 --> 00:22:19,353
your position might go 
down or even lose your job.

380
00:22:19,489 --> 00:22:20,299
Understand?

381
00:22:20,499 --> 00:22:22,683
[unclear talk]

382
00:22:29,981 --> 00:22:32,842
What? What the hell? What are you doing?

383
00:22:33,618 --> 00:22:35,811
-What are you doing? 
-Sorry, madam.

384
00:22:36,068 --> 00:22:36,974
Get out of my cabin.

385
00:22:37,441 --> 00:22:39,816
-Sorry, madam. 
-I said get out.

386
00:22:43,166 --> 00:22:44,012
How did I lose my control?

387
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:56,948
[dials]

388
00:22:57,806 --> 00:22:58,814
Come to my cabin.

389
00:22:59,014 --> 00:22:59,824
Madam...

390
00:23:00,024 --> 00:23:02,377
I said come to my cabin.

391
00:23:10,543 --> 00:23:11,913
How dare you touch me!

392
00:23:13,278 --> 00:23:14,924
Do you have any idea about what you did?

393
00:23:15,048 --> 00:23:18,446
I don't have any idea about it, madam. 
I don't know how I lost my control.

394
00:23:18,789 --> 00:23:21,295
People in the office get 
scared even to look at me.

395
00:23:21,549 --> 00:23:22,633
And you...

396
00:23:24,426 --> 00:23:26,756
You know what, I can fire you right now.

397
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:31,038
Madam, it was due to pressure, 
tension, bugs, codes,

398
00:23:31,891 --> 00:23:32,838
and messy lock, madam.

399
00:23:33,008 --> 00:23:33,979
What is messy lock?

400
00:23:34,174 --> 00:23:37,076
Err... It is a kind of lock, madam... 
that blocks our mind.

401
00:23:37,284 --> 00:23:39,730
Frankly speaking, I like you a lot, madam.

402
00:23:41,423 --> 00:23:43,457
You look very gorgeous 
from the front side.

403
00:23:44,494 --> 00:23:46,253
And when I saw your back...

404
00:23:46,517 --> 00:23:48,090
You mean... Is it love?

405
00:23:48,731 --> 00:23:49,672
Admiration, madam.

406
00:23:52,313 --> 00:23:53,869
A guy touched me for the first time.

407
00:23:54,225 --> 00:23:56,068
-Who is he, madam? 
-It is you.

408
00:23:56,596 --> 00:23:59,257
-You know what, I like that. 
-Madam...

409
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:02,517
Shall we go on a date on Sunday?

410
00:24:02,656 --> 00:24:04,851
-Madam... 
-Stop, this is office.

411
00:24:05,409 --> 00:24:06,787
Just behave yourself.

412
00:24:06,935 --> 00:24:07,510
Madam...

413
00:24:07,621 --> 00:24:09,547
-Dot! 
-Bye, madam... Bye...

414
00:24:12,238 --> 00:24:12,798
Bye, madam...

415
00:24:16,701 --> 00:24:17,600
-Hmm... 
-Sir...

416
00:24:17,814 --> 00:24:21,925
[clears throat] In the opening scene, 
there would be heavy rain.

417
00:24:22,527 --> 00:24:23,621
Very heavy rain, sir.

418
00:24:24,298 --> 00:24:26,851
Mother is be waiting in the kitchen.

419
00:24:27,086 --> 00:24:28,987
She is thinking very deeply for her son.

420
00:24:29,481 --> 00:24:32,296
Someone called, "Lakshmi..."

421
00:24:32,907 --> 00:24:34,800
There is a knocking on the door and 
the mother runs to attend the door.

422
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:36,022
She would open the door, sir.

423
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,157
When she opens it, it is her son.

424
00:24:38,292 --> 00:24:40,266
Six years old son... 
He called her 'Lakshmi'.

425
00:24:40,449 --> 00:24:43,392
The mother looks at her son and asks him, 
"Did you get drenched even today?"

426
00:24:43,845 --> 00:24:45,962
"You'd catch a cold. 
How many times should I tell you?"

427
00:24:46,265 --> 00:24:48,279
And she takes him 
inside holding his hand.

428
00:24:49,063 --> 00:24:52,641
Then, 
she wipes his hair with a white towel.

429
00:24:53,238 --> 00:24:56,629
The son tries avoiding her saying, 
"No, mother... Wait..."

430
00:24:56,733 --> 00:24:58,553
The mother says, "Hey, stay quiet. 
You'd catch a cold"

431
00:24:58,729 --> 00:25:00,825
"and you'd have trouble going to school."

432
00:25:01,468 --> 00:25:03,109
She wipes but he would push her.

433
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:05,787
The towel falls on her hand

434
00:25:06,471 --> 00:25:10,540
and the white towel turned red.

435
00:25:10,925 --> 00:25:11,874
We cut it there...

436
00:25:12,488 --> 00:25:18,397
[music mutes voice]

437
00:25:26,748 --> 00:25:28,427
That is the story, 
and that's the climax sir.

438
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:31,255
Fantastic! Marvellous! Fanatabulous!

439
00:25:31,682 --> 00:25:33,528
-Actually, I'm waiting for this story! 
-Thank you, sir.

440
00:25:33,619 --> 00:25:34,175
Raju!

441
00:25:36,055 --> 00:25:36,583
Get the cheque.

442
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:38,868
-[coughs] Sir, can I have water? 
-Sure.

443
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:41,664
Wonderful!

444
00:25:44,112 --> 00:25:48,527
Though my last film flopped, I would be 
reinstated in the industry with this story

445
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:50,542
I would be reinstated.

446
00:25:54,914 --> 00:25:56,434
-This is your first cheque. 
-Sir...

447
00:25:56,683 --> 00:25:59,717
-Congratulations! Six lakhs. 
-Thank you very much, sir.

448
00:25:59,935 --> 00:26:01,374
-Well, there is a small problem. 
-What is it, sir?

449
00:26:01,541 --> 00:26:03,858
My last movie incurred huge losses.

450
00:26:03,898 --> 00:26:04,314
Sir.

451
00:26:04,398 --> 00:26:08,465
So, I want to go with an 
experienced director this time.

452
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:11,788
So, sell your script to me.

453
00:26:11,891 --> 00:26:17,653
Sir. I came here trusting my story, 
but not to sell it.

454
00:26:19,899 --> 00:26:20,506
Sorry, sir.

455
00:26:20,818 --> 00:26:21,667
Uhuh...

456
00:26:26,844 --> 00:26:28,787
-Phani. 
-Sir.

457
00:26:28,926 --> 00:26:30,115
The industry is very small.

458
00:26:30,777 --> 00:26:31,957
You'll have to anyway end up 
here after roaming around.

459
00:26:33,087 --> 00:26:33,677
Think over.

460
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:37,202
Even on that day, I won't sell my belief.

461
00:26:38,116 --> 00:26:38,696
Thank you, sir.

462
00:26:44,876 --> 00:26:47,946
-What is my golden girl doing? 
-Waiting for you to come.

463
00:26:48,046 --> 00:26:49,257
What would she do if I come?

464
00:26:49,491 --> 00:26:52,662
She has learned a game called 
'fire in the blanket.'

465
00:26:52,795 --> 00:26:55,318
-She wants to play that game with you. 
-'Fire in the blanket?'

466
00:26:55,761 --> 00:26:57,829
-Yuck! What kind of game is that? 
-It is not a bad game.

467
00:26:57,941 --> 00:27:00,433
There is another game called 
'raid in the dark'.

468
00:27:00,503 --> 00:27:03,379
If you come, 
we shall play all the games in one day.

469
00:27:03,494 --> 00:27:06,326
Regardless of who wins the game, 
both would be rewarded.

470
00:27:06,406 --> 00:27:09,144
Hello, my boss would win it, 
not you or me.

471
00:27:09,426 --> 00:27:11,278
You know that my boss is a devil, right?

472
00:27:11,615 --> 00:27:14,276
Forget game, 
I can't even step outside my office.

473
00:27:14,376 --> 00:27:16,924
I don't know all that. 
You are coming, that's all.

474
00:27:17,024 --> 00:27:19,504
Oh man! Try to understand.

475
00:27:19,942 --> 00:27:21,727
How can I come? 
I told you that my boss would come, right?

476
00:27:22,179 --> 00:27:24,795
-Err... Oh... Cigarette. 
-Come to my cabin.

477
00:27:26,518 --> 00:27:27,299
-What happened? 
-Ah!

478
00:27:27,801 --> 00:27:29,736
Our boss has arrived. 
I'll call you later. Bye.

479
00:27:34,345 --> 00:27:35,035
May I come in, sir.

480
00:27:42,908 --> 00:27:44,179
Sir, can I take my seat?

481
00:27:44,685 --> 00:27:45,587
-No. 
-Oh!

482
00:27:45,813 --> 00:27:47,680
I went to meet the client.

483
00:27:47,877 --> 00:27:49,155
-Didn't my colleagues inform you, sir? 
-Which client?

484
00:27:49,214 --> 00:27:50,362
A big company named Okasta, sir.

485
00:27:50,487 --> 00:27:53,404
The MD of that company was in a meeting 
with me. Were you with his manager?

486
00:27:53,461 --> 00:27:57,883
-[phone rings] Ah! One minute, sir. 
-Hmph!

487
00:27:58,417 --> 00:27:59,961
-Hello 
-Hello sir. I'm Tulasi.

488
00:28:00,094 --> 00:28:03,055
I'm calling from Bank of Balanagar 
to discuss about personal loan.

489
00:28:03,582 --> 00:28:06,557
Ma'am, I'm in a very important meeting. 
Call me in the evening.

490
00:28:06,653 --> 00:28:09,517
-Okay, sir. Thank you. I'll call you later 
-Okay.

491
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:12,701
Sorry, sir. [phone rings]

492
00:28:13,921 --> 00:28:15,631
Hi darling, what are you doing?

493
00:28:15,766 --> 00:28:17,979
Nothing, deleting the scrap.

494
00:28:18,166 --> 00:28:19,305
-Is it? 
-Am I scrap?

495
00:28:19,362 --> 00:28:22,813
-Will you come early at least today? 
-Not possible today.

496
00:28:22,913 --> 00:28:26,609
Uh-oh! Alright, 
I feel like eating chicken curry today.

497
00:28:26,676 --> 00:28:27,660
-Sir.. May I go? 
-Can you send...

498
00:28:27,729 --> 00:28:29,407
...two kgs of chicken meat with someone?

499
00:28:30,793 --> 00:28:33,286
I'll send a guy. Be careful with him.

500
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:37,088
He is the one who gets chicken 
when asked for chicken meat.

501
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,445
He will be there in an hour. 
Is it okay for you?

502
00:28:39,538 --> 00:28:42,757
-Okay, baby. Miss you, bye. 
-Okay, bye.

503
00:28:45,057 --> 00:28:49,127
Well, take this money and take two 
kilograms of chicken meat to my home.

504
00:28:49,142 --> 00:28:52,065
Sir... Me? Chicken? 
There is a lot of work in the office.

505
00:28:52,201 --> 00:28:54,161
I have to win the best employee award. 
I have to work.

506
00:28:54,262 --> 00:28:59,346
Is it? You won't do the work assigned 
for you, but you'd project a lot!

507
00:28:59,635 --> 00:29:01,177
First, go to my home and 
deliver the chicken meat.

508
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:02,474
Otherwise,

509
00:29:03,130 --> 00:29:06,043
I'll mark two days of leave for you as you 
didn't attend the office on the day before

510
00:29:06,455 --> 00:29:07,606
and for yesterday's late-login.

511
00:29:07,691 --> 00:29:08,433
I will leave, sir.

512
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:12,904
[door bell rings]

513
00:29:25,835 --> 00:29:31,256
"Come... Come to me..."

514
00:29:32,389 --> 00:29:36,999
-Chicken. 
-"My beauty is yours"

515
00:29:39,088 --> 00:29:45,059
"Come... Come to me..."

516
00:29:45,828 --> 00:29:50,613
"My beauty is yours"

517
00:29:52,452 --> 00:29:58,206
"Lay your hands... The girl is yours"

518
00:29:59,201 --> 00:30:05,102
"Touch me... This body is yours"

519
00:30:05,302 --> 00:30:08,129
"Oh... Touch me... 
Touch me... Touch me..."

520
00:30:08,656 --> 00:30:11,483
"Oh... Kiss me... Kiss me... Kiss me..."

521
00:30:12,305 --> 00:30:18,237
"Touch me... Touch me... Touch me... 
Oh... Kiss me... Kiss me... Kiss me..."

522
00:30:19,075 --> 00:30:24,153
"Come... Come to me..."

523
00:30:25,716 --> 00:30:30,589
"My beauty is yours"

524
00:30:31,183 --> 00:30:31,857
Are you ready?

525
00:30:33,413 --> 00:30:34,381
What happened, dude?

526
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:41,143
Don't you have common sense? Uhuh.

527
00:30:43,047 --> 00:30:44,496
Do you understand what you are doing?

528
00:30:45,174 --> 00:30:46,336
Oh! Is it?

529
00:30:46,586 --> 00:30:48,279
Know how to behave with women.

530
00:30:48,479 --> 00:30:50,072
Uhuh! Useless fellow.

531
00:30:51,208 --> 00:30:53,169
Ah! Oh! You are serious?

532
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:55,081
Fine, I'm sorry.

533
00:30:56,757 --> 00:30:59,860
Hey, it is a rare opportunity.

534
00:31:00,989 --> 00:31:02,163
Please tell him not to be stubborn

535
00:31:02,611 --> 00:31:04,979
and get me out of this danger 
by telling him something.

536
00:31:05,179 --> 00:31:05,776
How much time?

537
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,456
Ah! Look she is shouting.

538
00:31:07,656 --> 00:31:10,558
Ah! Almost convinced. It's coming. 
Sorry... Sorry, I'm coming.

539
00:31:10,758 --> 00:31:12,948
Hey... Hey... You do something. Start it.

540
00:31:13,699 --> 00:31:14,358
Ah! You won't let it?

541
00:31:15,050 --> 00:31:15,637
Phew!

542
00:31:16,777 --> 00:31:18,836
"Oh no! Oh no! Oh no! Oh no!"

543
00:31:20,219 --> 00:31:21,811
"Oh no! Oh no! Oh no! Oh no!"

544
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:26,480
"Isn't there any matter? 
Are you incapable?"

545
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:29,862
"Can't you let your grief inside you out?"

546
00:31:30,062 --> 00:31:31,741
"Oh no! Oh no! Oh no! Oh no!"

547
00:31:33,468 --> 00:31:35,130
"Oh no! Oh no! Oh no! Oh no!"

[phone rings]

554
00:31:59,355 --> 00:32:01,082
-Hello 
-Sir, I'm Tulasi speaking.

555
00:32:01,541 --> 00:32:04,534
-Who is it? 
-Sir, I'm Tulasi from Bank of Balanagar.

556
00:32:06,904 --> 00:32:08,782
Ms Tulasi, 
you've called at the right time.

557
00:32:08,982 --> 00:32:10,067
-One minute please. 
-Okay, sir.

558
00:32:12,247 --> 00:32:15,410
-Oh my God! What? 
-What happened, sir?

559
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:17,735
How did it happen that way?

560
00:32:18,026 --> 00:32:19,583
Nothing would happen to the kid. 
I'm there for him.

561
00:32:19,783 --> 00:32:20,360
Kid?

562
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,186
Yeah, that is what I'm telling. 
Even my blood group is the same.

563
00:32:22,386 --> 00:32:23,887
-Blood? 
-I would donate even if it is one litre.

564
00:32:24,087 --> 00:32:25,469
-One litre blood? 
-Sorry. You don't worry.

565
00:32:25,569 --> 00:32:28,092
-Aunt, don't cry. I'm on the way. 
-Why would I cry, sir?

566
00:32:28,124 --> 00:32:29,305
Hey... Hey... Give way.

567
00:32:29,528 --> 00:32:30,337
-[imitates horn sound] 
-Are you driving, sir?

568
00:32:30,457 --> 00:32:31,623
-Are you hearing the horn? 
-Horn?

569
00:32:31,767 --> 00:32:33,257
I'm driving, Aunt. 
I'll call you later. Bye.

570
00:32:33,369 --> 00:32:34,924
-Sir... Sir... 
-What happened, darling?

571
00:32:35,925 --> 00:32:36,444
You are asking what happened?

572
00:32:37,168 --> 00:32:41,265
See, the doctors are struggling 
so hard to save my granny's heart.

573
00:32:42,513 --> 00:32:45,490
Already, there was a lot of blood loss. 
And I have to go.

574
00:32:46,318 --> 00:32:47,765
Fine. Go!

575
00:32:54,942 --> 00:32:56,398
Oh! Is it so much?

576
00:32:59,065 --> 00:33:00,117
Yeah... This is correct.

577
00:33:01,047 --> 00:33:01,744
-[knocking on door] May I come in, sir? 
-Oh no!

578
00:33:05,045 --> 00:33:06,128
Who the hell came?

579
00:33:08,865 --> 00:33:09,881
-Come, be seated. 
-Ah!

580
00:33:10,968 --> 00:33:12,465
-I said 'be seated'. 
-Oh!

581
00:33:12,618 --> 00:33:13,983
-Seems like he got worried. 
-You asked me to take the seat!

582
00:33:15,966 --> 00:33:17,173
-What's your problem? 
-What?

583
00:33:17,449 --> 00:33:19,911
Do you think we'd lose 
our language and accent?

584
00:33:20,111 --> 00:33:21,623
-Oh! 
-Tell me your problem.

585
00:33:21,823 --> 00:33:23,605
Sir, my problem is that...

586
00:33:23,805 --> 00:33:24,482
What is this?

587
00:33:24,674 --> 00:33:26,511
-It was almost over, sir... 
-Yes.

588
00:33:26,907 --> 00:33:28,735
-But it got finished in the meantime. 
-What is finished?

589
00:33:29,729 --> 00:33:31,297
-How should I explain it? 
-Explain it in whatever ways you want.

590
00:33:32,656 --> 00:33:34,868
-You know Alibaba and 40 thieves, right? 
-Yes, I do.

591
00:33:34,968 --> 00:33:36,672
-The forty thieves entered the cave 
-Okay...

592
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:37,850
But Alibaba couldn't.

593
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:41,193
Why couldn't Alibaba enter the cave 
and why are you saying that to me?

594
00:33:41,393 --> 00:33:43,714
Just explain me your problem 
detailedly in an understandable way.

595
00:33:43,973 --> 00:33:44,789
-Sir... 
-Yes...

596
00:33:45,384 --> 00:33:49,054
Sings: Gunna Mamidi Komma Meeda song. 
Do you know this song?

597
00:33:49,254 --> 00:33:52,232
I saw that song during my father's time. 
That's a kid's movie, right?

598
00:33:52,432 --> 00:33:53,199
I know that song. So what?

599
00:33:53,427 --> 00:33:55,005
But one line from that song is my problem.

600
00:33:55,205 --> 00:33:55,801
What is that line?

601
00:33:56,001 --> 00:34:01,377
"The cuckoo already cooed out of hasty"

602
00:34:02,161 --> 00:34:04,789
-"and danced" 
-Whoa! It didn't go till the dance, sir.

603
00:34:04,989 --> 00:34:05,942
It just cooed already.

604
00:34:06,142 --> 00:34:08,205
-Oh! You were already finished! 
-May I come in, sir.

605
00:34:08,305 --> 00:34:09,090
This fellow is fast.

606
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:10,467
Yeah... Come in.

607
00:34:10,862 --> 00:34:12,207
-Coffee. 
-Give him too.

608
00:34:13,296 --> 00:34:14,429
-Sir, please. 
-Hey...

609
00:34:14,729 --> 00:34:17,003
We're friends, right? I'm her Alibaba.

610
00:34:17,203 --> 00:34:17,753
First, take the coffee.

611
00:34:17,953 --> 00:34:19,143
-Sorry. 
-Bloody ogling!

612
00:34:19,343 --> 00:34:20,483
-Sorry, sir. 
-Give him coffee.

613
00:34:21,198 --> 00:34:22,468
-Place the biscuits there. 
-Thank you.

614
00:34:23,663 --> 00:34:24,243
Leave.

615
00:34:25,037 --> 00:34:26,379
What are you staring here and there? 
Just leave.

616
00:34:27,331 --> 00:34:28,899
Oh man! He seems like a magnet.

617
00:34:29,430 --> 00:34:30,898
Have coffee. Look here...

618
00:34:31,347 --> 00:34:32,361
Sir, my problem...

619
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:35,445
Take a biscuit first.

620
00:34:35,805 --> 00:34:37,952
-Sir, my problem... 
-Just take the biscuit I say.

621
00:34:38,129 --> 00:34:39,194
We'll the know the problem.

622
00:34:39,608 --> 00:34:40,462
Confusing!

623
00:34:40,662 --> 00:34:41,521
Dip it and eat.

624
00:34:41,822 --> 00:34:42,983
Stir it well.

625
00:34:52,165 --> 00:34:52,995
What happened?

626
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:55,523
Did it fall? That's your problem.

627
00:34:55,623 --> 00:34:56,233
Understood?

628
00:34:56,548 --> 00:34:58,584
-It fell, sir. 
-It falls before you eat it completely.

629
00:34:59,168 --> 00:35:01,676
-I didn't understand, sir. 
-You won't understand... You won't.

630
00:35:01,876 --> 00:35:03,708
You won't understand until 
I tell you in your language.

631
00:35:04,259 --> 00:35:05,266
-This is you. 
-Me?

632
00:35:05,606 --> 00:35:07,082
-This is your world. 
-Mine?

633
00:35:07,282 --> 00:35:08,544
You'll enter into this world and

634
00:35:09,432 --> 00:35:13,133
totally roam with your difficulties, 
problems, tensions, pressures etc.

635
00:35:13,233 --> 00:35:16,092
You'll keep on roaming and... Ah! 
And at last...

636
00:35:18,091 --> 00:35:19,240
Your position will become like this.

637
00:35:19,479 --> 00:35:19,962
Sir...

638
00:35:20,216 --> 00:35:21,037
What is this problem called, sir?

639
00:35:21,484 --> 00:35:23,365
This is called PME disorder.

640
00:35:23,565 --> 00:35:24,582
-PME disorder? 
-Yes.

641
00:35:24,782 --> 00:35:25,259
What does it mean?

642
00:35:25,484 --> 00:35:27,797
Premature ejaculation syndrome.

643
00:35:28,833 --> 00:35:29,723
-Err... That's it. 
-Ah?

644
00:35:29,823 --> 00:35:30,864
-That's it. 
-That's it.

645
00:35:31,064 --> 00:35:32,251
-That's it. 
-Sir...

646
00:35:32,451 --> 00:35:33,543
Why am I the only one who is affected?

647
00:35:33,643 --> 00:35:35,528
People like you think that you are 
the only ones who would be hardworking

648
00:35:35,728 --> 00:35:37,105
and contributing to the world.

649
00:35:37,305 --> 00:35:39,334
You'd skip sleep citing you don't need it.

650
00:35:39,534 --> 00:35:41,771
You'd work hard day and 
night without sleeping,

651
00:35:42,033 --> 00:35:45,061
Educated people like you, 
software guys and marketing guys,

652
00:35:45,261 --> 00:35:46,598
do nothing but work all day.

653
00:35:46,798 --> 00:35:48,942
You people get this kind of 
disorders and sit on my head.

654
00:35:50,883 --> 00:35:53,386
-Isn't there any medicine for this? 
-What medicine?

655
00:35:53,486 --> 00:35:56,074
I'm Dr Bali. No medicines, no treatments.

656
00:35:56,894 --> 00:35:58,014
Only ball. That's it.

657
00:35:58,961 --> 00:35:59,745
What shall I do?

658
00:36:00,245 --> 00:36:01,378
Don't act. You know about it.

659
00:36:01,578 --> 00:36:02,218
Hey...

660
00:36:02,418 --> 00:36:03,829
Whoa... Whoa... Don't squeeze so hard.

661
00:36:03,890 --> 00:36:04,969
If you find it, 
will you go on a squeezing spree?

662
00:36:05,366 --> 00:36:06,820
This is the problem with guys like you.

663
00:36:07,306 --> 00:36:08,763
If you find it, 
will you go on a squeezing spree?

664
00:36:09,131 --> 00:36:10,128
Squeeze it smoothly.

665
00:36:10,756 --> 00:36:11,535
[laughs]

666
00:36:12,287 --> 00:36:13,124
Oh yeah!

667
00:36:13,324 --> 00:36:15,941
-Sir, if I do this, will my problem... 
-Yes, it will be healed.

668
00:36:16,141 --> 00:36:17,311
You have to keep on squeezing like that.

669
00:36:17,759 --> 00:36:18,558
It is nice, sir.

670
00:36:20,094 --> 00:36:23,505
Today morning, 
I'm in a super romantic mood.

671
00:36:24,113 --> 00:36:27,447
So, I'm writing a super romantic scene.

672
00:36:28,613 --> 00:36:31,072
Exactly, at that time...

673
00:36:43,208 --> 00:36:43,989
Sir...

674
00:36:44,089 --> 00:36:45,511
Damn you! With a maid?

675
00:36:46,649 --> 00:36:48,492
You! I and him are much better.

676
00:36:49,075 --> 00:36:50,320
You seem to be a cheapskate.

677
00:36:51,484 --> 00:36:54,264
Hey, if something had gone wrong today,

678
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,870
or if I couldn't have controlled myself,

679
00:36:57,169 --> 00:36:59,906
both of us would have 
settled down washing dishes.

680
00:37:00,106 --> 00:37:01,195
I would have lost my honour.

681
00:37:01,702 --> 00:37:03,365
As the producer made a phone 
call at the right time,

682
00:37:03,796 --> 00:37:06,328
I have laid my hands on 
the phone instead of her.

683
00:37:06,883 --> 00:37:08,188
So you didn't get to touch her?

684
00:37:08,388 --> 00:37:09,405
Nothing at all.

685
00:37:09,933 --> 00:37:11,144
Anyway, what do you know about my pain?

686
00:37:11,563 --> 00:37:13,623
You'll have girls in marketing and 
you'll have them in the software company.

687
00:37:13,823 --> 00:37:14,481
Who do I have?

688
00:37:16,247 --> 00:37:17,340
The only girl I have...

689
00:37:17,659 --> 00:37:19,916
She is the only girl 
who shares my solitude.

690
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:21,065
[laughs]

691
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:22,669
He is right, dude.

692
00:37:22,769 --> 00:37:26,400
A guy with raging hormones 
finds a maid like a heroine.

693
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,604
This is fine but...

694
00:37:28,638 --> 00:37:32,546
I feel that we can't do anything even 
after marriage if we are like this.

695
00:37:32,606 --> 00:37:33,888
Yes, it is true.

696
00:37:34,213 --> 00:37:36,224
HR told me that she'd 
meet me in three days.

697
00:37:36,424 --> 00:37:38,151
I doubt that even I might end up like you.

698
00:37:38,351 --> 00:37:40,244
A guitar string might break 
after being worn by usage,

699
00:37:41,139 --> 00:37:42,175
but imagine having no guitar!

700
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:45,175
Oh no! If this persists,

701
00:37:45,787 --> 00:37:49,143
I'm scared that I might end 
up with that maid someday.

702
00:37:49,343 --> 00:37:50,884
Hey, I've got an idea.

703
00:37:51,543 --> 00:37:53,263
Three of us have almost 
have the same kind of fear.

704
00:37:53,845 --> 00:37:54,742
-So... 
-So...

705
00:37:55,022 --> 00:37:55,431
So...

706
00:37:56,873 --> 00:37:58,511
A girl... Sorry... Sorry...

707
00:37:59,224 --> 00:38:00,091
Let's get a woman.

708
00:38:00,629 --> 00:38:01,192
So,

709
00:38:02,073 --> 00:38:03,587
it is like a short film before a movie.

710
00:38:03,687 --> 00:38:05,348
Yes. Just like net practice 
before the actual match.

711
00:38:05,654 --> 00:38:06,914
Like having first night 
before the wedding.

712
00:38:07,794 --> 00:38:09,471
I didn't get the actual 
situational dialogue in my mind.

713
00:38:09,641 --> 00:38:10,257
Damn you!

714
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:11,890
Let's get a woman.

715
00:38:12,355 --> 00:38:14,903
If it is a girl, she would make us 
hurry and spoil the entire plan.

716
00:38:15,279 --> 00:38:17,460
But if it is a woman, she would 
cooperate with us in every aspect,

717
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:20,841
with her experience and 
make our event successful.

718
00:38:20,866 --> 00:38:21,680
Yes!

719
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:23,316
A woman is the right choice!

720
00:38:23,516 --> 00:38:25,101
Dude, there might be some problem.

721
00:38:25,201 --> 00:38:25,977
Stop it, dude!

722
00:38:26,177 --> 00:38:29,660
Brothel case is better than 
a rape case from that maid.

723
00:38:30,441 --> 00:38:32,250
I know a manager named Raju.

724
00:38:32,450 --> 00:38:34,663
He would definitely have the phone 
number of these kinds of women.

725
00:38:34,863 --> 00:38:37,267
-We'll call them. 
-The idea seems to be good,

726
00:38:38,563 --> 00:38:41,034
but there wasn't even a single 
girl to accompany us to a pub.

727
00:38:41,512 --> 00:38:42,605
When that's the case...

728
00:38:42,761 --> 00:38:46,398
[scoffs] Bro, if fear had a 
brother-in-law, he might be like this guy.

729
00:38:47,266 --> 00:38:48,636
Why do you think negatively all the time?

730
00:38:48,836 --> 00:38:52,407
Hey, forget him and call Raju. 
It's already late.

731
00:38:53,148 --> 00:38:54,197
[sighs]

732
00:38:55,479 --> 00:38:56,918
[ringing tone]

733
00:38:57,526 --> 00:38:58,368
Ah! Yes!

734
00:38:59,354 --> 00:39:00,343
Hello

735
00:39:01,043 --> 00:39:02,202
Raju sir, greetings sir.

736
00:39:02,526 --> 00:39:04,046
Greetings, director-to-be!

737
00:39:04,246 --> 00:39:05,191
How are you doing?

738
00:39:05,385 --> 00:39:07,120
Sir, I'm fine. How are you doing?

739
00:39:07,328 --> 00:39:10,575
I'm fine. What's up? 
Why did you call at this time?

740
00:39:11,866 --> 00:39:13,814
The thing is that...

741
00:39:14,075 --> 00:39:15,530
Why are you muttering?

742
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:17,582
A director should directly 
convey anything directly.

743
00:39:17,818 --> 00:39:18,587
Tell me, no problem.

744
00:39:18,687 --> 00:39:19,812
-Ask him... Ask him... 
-Sir, actually...

745
00:39:20,012 --> 00:39:21,600
I'm in a party with friends.

746
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:22,495
Good.

747
00:39:22,595 --> 00:39:24,124
A woman...

748
00:39:24,324 --> 00:39:27,870
-Eh... A woman? 
-Yes, sir...

749
00:39:28,379 --> 00:39:31,348
Actually, my friends are asking.

750
00:39:31,654 --> 00:39:34,859
Ah! Come on! Am I the only one who 
you found at this time of the night?

751
00:39:34,944 --> 00:39:36,458
You have called and asking for a woman?

752
00:39:36,658 --> 00:39:37,713
Well... This is my first time, sir...

753
00:39:37,973 --> 00:39:40,036
Is it? Do you want a woman?

754
00:39:40,436 --> 00:39:42,951
-Why would I supply women, anyway? 
-Sir...

755
00:39:43,151 --> 00:39:44,777
-There wouldn't be anyone. 
-Sir, please don't say that.

756
00:39:45,066 --> 00:39:46,716
You just try it and my work would be done, 
sir.

757
00:39:47,246 --> 00:39:49,551
Well, I'll give a phone number of a woman.

758
00:39:50,055 --> 00:39:51,697
You guys talk to her 
but don't take my name.

759
00:39:51,797 --> 00:39:53,211
-Okay? 
-Okay. Sure, sir.

760
00:39:53,411 --> 00:39:53,821
Okay, sir.

761
00:39:54,614 --> 00:39:58,353
Hear me, such matters are 
to be dealt very carefully.

762
00:39:58,897 --> 00:40:00,632
-Sir, I'll handle it. I'll handle it. Bye. 
-Careful.

763
00:40:00,832 --> 00:40:01,672
-Bye, sir. 
-See you.

764
00:40:02,157 --> 00:40:02,897
Dude...

765
00:40:03,148 --> 00:40:04,490
-He said he would send the number. 
-Yes!

766
00:40:05,188 --> 00:40:06,685
[dialpad sounds]

767
00:40:09,914 --> 00:40:11,109
Switch on the speaker... 
Switch on the speaker...

768
00:40:11,309 --> 00:40:12,360
Ah! Come on, do it.

769
00:40:13,279 --> 00:40:17,133
[dialer tone rings]

770
00:40:22,123 --> 00:40:24,205
-[dialer tone rings] Hello. 
-Talk to her...

771
00:40:25,412 --> 00:40:27,273
-Hello... 
-Hey, talk to her...

772
00:40:29,613 --> 00:40:31,179
-Hello... 
-Hey, talk to her...

773
00:40:34,041 --> 00:40:35,564
-Remove the hand. 
-Hey...

774
00:40:36,065 --> 00:40:37,440
What happened? Why don't you talk?

775
00:40:37,756 --> 00:40:39,337
What happened to you, then? 
Why didn't you talk?

776
00:40:39,956 --> 00:40:42,013
Why should I take the tension 
and you have the pleasure?

777
00:40:42,968 --> 00:40:44,392
Alright. I will deal this time.

778
00:40:44,656 --> 00:40:45,502
Come on.

779
00:40:46,554 --> 00:40:48,523
[dialpad sounds]

780
00:40:52,503 --> 00:40:53,291
This one...

781
00:40:55,158 --> 00:40:56,689
Watch me, how I would talk to her.

782
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:01,099
[dialer tone rings] It's ringing.

783
00:41:05,402 --> 00:41:06,421
-Hello 
-Hello

784
00:41:06,621 --> 00:41:07,178
[clears throat]

785
00:41:07,378 --> 00:41:08,792
Sorry... Hello...

786
00:41:10,519 --> 00:41:11,140
Who is it?

787
00:41:11,792 --> 00:41:13,627
Come on, tell her... Come on, tell her...

788
00:41:15,258 --> 00:41:16,409
Hello, madam.

789
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:18,741
Yes, tell me. Who is it?

790
00:41:19,376 --> 00:41:21,522
-Santosh. 
-You fool! Why do you tell your name?

791
00:41:21,722 --> 00:41:22,222
She heard it.

792
00:41:22,701 --> 00:41:24,990
Madam, my name is Santosh.

793
00:41:25,646 --> 00:41:29,376
I'm working as a marketing executive 
in the Inner Feelings company.

794
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:32,622
Err... Our company manufactures inners.

795
00:41:33,227 --> 00:41:35,776
I've called you to explain about that.

796
00:41:36,441 --> 00:41:38,542
-What? 
-I meant, you might buy.

797
00:41:38,742 --> 00:41:40,698
-What nonsense are you talking? 
-We'll give you 'buy one get one free'.

798
00:41:40,898 --> 00:41:42,084
Are you out of your mind? Huh!

799
00:41:42,835 --> 00:41:43,807
Oh no!

800
00:41:44,398 --> 00:41:45,182
Oh no!

801
00:41:45,382 --> 00:41:47,518
You fool! We've asked you to 
call her to show our talent,

802
00:41:47,718 --> 00:41:48,931
but you were showing 
your marketing talent.

803
00:41:49,131 --> 00:41:51,170
Hey, as if I have a experience in this.

804
00:41:51,370 --> 00:41:52,398
I've talked out of tension.

805
00:41:52,698 --> 00:41:53,891
-You do that and you'd understand. 
-Hey...

806
00:41:54,091 --> 00:41:56,180
I've dealt with a lot of US 
clients and people like this.

807
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:59,020
This is nothing. 
Now, watch my amassing talent.

808
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:00,921
-It is amazing not amassing. 
-I know!

809
00:42:01,121 --> 00:42:02,157
I said that as I thought 
both of you wouldn't know it.

810
00:42:02,357 --> 00:42:02,946
Come here.

811
00:42:05,026 --> 00:42:05,620
Half a ball?

812
00:42:10,626 --> 00:42:11,979
Hey, switch on the speaker.

813
00:42:12,507 --> 00:42:16,773
[dialer tone rings]

814
00:42:17,926 --> 00:42:20,323
Hello, who are you? What do you want?

815
00:42:21,362 --> 00:42:26,519
Madam, I'm Anand. 
I and my friends are partying today.

816
00:42:26,912 --> 00:42:29,123
So, 
I called you to invite you as our guest.

817
00:42:30,454 --> 00:42:31,561
Eh... Programme?

818
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:33,511
Which programme and why am I the guest?

819
00:42:33,711 --> 00:42:36,804
This is 'Rock the party' programme.

820
00:42:38,026 --> 00:42:40,802
Hey, are you out of your mind? 
What are you talking?

821
00:42:42,365 --> 00:42:47,905
To be frank, I've called you 
to book you for tonight, madam.

822
00:42:48,839 --> 00:42:51,264
We are three members and 
we'll pay you 30,000 rupees.

823
00:42:51,866 --> 00:42:54,499
If you agree, please let me know, madam.

824
00:42:55,556 --> 00:42:57,109
Hey, who the hell are you?

825
00:42:57,576 --> 00:42:58,561
Who gave you my number?

826
00:42:59,664 --> 00:43:01,528
What's with three members 
booking me and 30,000 rupees?

827
00:43:01,728 --> 00:43:04,584
I'll slap you with my footwear 
if you call me again, fools!

828
00:43:06,246 --> 00:43:07,069
Damn!

829
00:43:07,330 --> 00:43:10,118
Why do you shout like that? 
If you don't like, just simply say no.

830
00:43:11,237 --> 00:43:14,002
Hey, 
this is not the way I should deal you.

831
00:43:14,202 --> 00:43:15,824
-I'll complain to the police and... 
-Police?

832
00:43:16,024 --> 00:43:18,747
-they would take you to task precisely. 
-Disconnect... Disconnect...

833
00:43:19,099 --> 00:43:20,353
-Thank God! 
-Thank God!

834
00:43:21,105 --> 00:43:22,830
Oh man! Would it become a police case?

835
00:43:23,246 --> 00:43:25,874
Precisely, these types of matters 
wouldn't become a police case.

836
00:43:26,125 --> 00:43:26,623
Why?

837
00:43:28,796 --> 00:43:31,516
[sobs]

838
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,165
She knows my name.

839
00:43:34,839 --> 00:43:36,381
She knows my company's name too.

840
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:38,806
You've called from my phone.

841
00:43:39,030 --> 00:43:44,678
If cops come to know about this, 
they'll play football with me in jail.

842
00:43:45,307 --> 00:43:47,113
[in unison]: It's your phone number. 
We don't have a problem.

843
00:43:48,777 --> 00:43:52,788
If the cops take me to jail and play 
football, I'll reveal your names.

844
00:43:52,988 --> 00:43:57,140
[sobbing] Oh man!

845
00:44:00,091 --> 00:44:01,933
This is how our lives are destined to be.

846
00:44:02,339 --> 00:44:04,854
What is the use, 
no matter how much we try like this?

847
00:44:05,491 --> 00:44:06,992
All we would be left with is...

848
00:44:08,863 --> 00:44:09,484
You are right, man.

[message notification tone]

850
00:44:12,903 --> 00:44:14,894
I'm okay if it is fifty thousand rupees.

851
00:44:19,326 --> 00:44:24,289
-My share is twenty thousand. 
-My share is fifteen thousand.

852
00:44:24,739 --> 00:44:26,747
The remaining amount is my share.

853
00:44:27,353 --> 00:44:28,062
Let's pledge.

854
00:44:32,424 --> 00:44:35,209
-I, Phani, 
-I, Anand,

855
00:44:35,312 --> 00:44:36,467
I, Santosh,

856
00:44:36,878 --> 00:44:39,552
We will make justification 
to the fifty thousand,

857
00:44:39,745 --> 00:44:41,345
We will prove that we're men.

858
00:44:41,421 --> 00:44:43,394
We will put a full stop to all our doubts.

859
00:44:43,494 --> 00:44:45,280
I will pick up the woman.

860
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:46,728
I will get beers and Biryani.

861
00:44:46,828 --> 00:44:48,009
Then, what shall I get?

862
00:44:48,209 --> 00:44:50,086
One should take precautions 
to avoid dangers.

863
00:44:50,132 --> 00:44:51,817
Got you. I'll get them.

864
00:44:52,017 --> 00:44:52,558
Hmm...

865
00:44:53,070 --> 00:44:54,629
-This is my oath. 
-This is my oath.

866
00:44:54,790 --> 00:44:56,065
-This is my oath. 
-Third oath.

867
00:44:56,141 --> 00:44:56,919
This is my oath.

870
00:45:22,463 --> 00:45:22,996

873
00:45:42,816 --> 00:45:43,804
Which film does this song belong?

874
00:45:44,398 --> 00:45:45,200
I don't know, brother.

875
00:45:45,872 --> 00:45:46,349
Hey,

876
00:45:48,139 --> 00:45:50,393
We came to the department 
not to be honest.

877
00:45:50,809 --> 00:45:51,538
But to run business.

878
00:45:52,316 --> 00:45:54,934
You asked me to get you out 
of the case and I did it.

879
00:45:55,350 --> 00:45:57,370
You said you'd pay one 
lakh rupees and I agreed.

880
00:45:58,222 --> 00:46:00,582
You've asked for two days of 
time and I gave you seven days.

881
00:46:01,562 --> 00:46:02,800
-Please leave me, brother. 
-[scoffs]

882
00:46:03,306 --> 00:46:05,096
I beg you brother. Please!

883
00:46:05,425 --> 00:46:06,662
Pleas try to understand, brother.

884
00:46:07,179 --> 00:46:09,160
You should have told this on that day.

885
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:12,247
You thought switching off that 
phone would solve your problems.

886
00:46:12,347 --> 00:46:14,060
I switched off the phone 
as I was scared of you.

887
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:17,294
-I beg you bro. 
-Did you think you can't get caught?

888
00:46:17,394 --> 00:46:18,720
-No, brother. 
-How did you get caught now?

889
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:20,646
Brother, my kid is lying ill at home.

890
00:46:20,846 --> 00:46:22,009
-My situation is very bad, brother. 
-Hey!

891
00:46:22,209 --> 00:46:22,947
Please, brother.

892
00:46:23,650 --> 00:46:25,305
You are not realising my good nature.

893
00:46:25,505 --> 00:46:26,424
No, brother.

894
00:46:27,802 --> 00:46:29,394
-Please, brother... 
-I'm a good cop.

895
00:46:29,494 --> 00:46:31,971
-Please, brother... 
-You are a bad guy.

896
00:46:32,008 --> 00:46:33,871
Brother, give me two days and 
I'll pay by any means. Please.

897
00:46:34,518 --> 00:46:36,306
-Believe me, brother. 
-Two days, are you sure?

898
00:46:36,506 --> 00:46:38,112
I swear, brother. 
I'll pay you in two days.

00:46:38,403 --> 00:46:38,990
Okay.

-Two days! 
-Brother, I swear on God,

903
00:46:54,303 --> 00:46:54,972
Two days, brother. [gunshot]

904
00:46:59,130 --> 00:47:01,691
I hate God. Goddammit!

905
00:47:02,144 --> 00:47:02,934
Disgusting people!

906
00:47:05,159 --> 00:47:06,658
-Why didn't she come yet? 
-Don't know.

00:47:39,411 --> 00:47:40,328
Please sit down, madam.

00:47:41,334 --> 00:47:42,411
It's me, Santosh.

912

Inner Feelings company is mine.

913
00:47:44,232 --> 00:47:44,856
You fool!

914
00:47:45,056 --> 00:47:46,074
Did she ask you? Go away.

915
00:47:49,181 --> 00:47:50,289
Madam, have it.

916
00:47:55,036 --> 00:47:55,522
Madam.

917
00:47:56,020 --> 00:47:58,826
I'm Anand, madam. 
I'm the one who arranged this programme.

918
00:47:59,637 --> 00:48:02,842
Hmm... 
Is it just words or is there any action?

919
00:48:05,929 --> 00:48:07,530
Well, where is the bedroom?

920
00:48:13,689 --> 00:48:14,458
Madam,

921
00:48:15,797 --> 00:48:18,117
you didn't tell your name.

922
00:48:18,478 --> 00:48:19,784

"I will go"

924
00:48:29,413 --> 00:48:30,780
"I will go"

925
00:48:32,107 --> 00:48:33,635
"No, I will go"

926
00:48:40,019 --> 00:48:41,271
What is your problem?

927
00:48:43,078 --> 00:48:44,441
-Let's roll dice. 
-Hmm... Okay.

928
00:48:44,641 --> 00:48:46,093
-Shall we decide with the dice? 
-Okay.

929
00:48:46,393 --> 00:48:48,388
Hey, what's your number?

930
00:48:48,488 --> 00:48:49,202

00:48:49,302 --> 00:48:50,834
-Hey! 
-Six. Sorry.

932
00:48:51,859 --> 00:48:53,847
-What about you? 
-My rating is always top class.

933
00:48:54,047 --> 00:48:55,187
So, one is my number.

934

-Let's see. 
-And you?

935
00:48:57,249 --> 00:49:00,442
As I've got the vigor of a bee, 
I'll choose three.

936
00:49:00,642 --> 00:49:02,095
Okay. Roll the dice, we'll see.

937
00:49:04,065 --> 00:49:05,723
Hey! Yes! Yes!

Sings: I'll the rock the night...

941
00:49:13,685 --> 00:49:14,782
I should have chosen six.

[whistles]

943
00:49:22,539 --> 00:49:24,268
Ah! Isn't there an AC in the room?

944
00:49:24,468 --> 00:49:26,478
We have only fan as we're just bachelors.

945
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:33,432
Do you have water?

946
00:49:33,895 --> 00:49:34,944
Ah! One minute, madam.

947
00:49:39,231 --> 00:49:40,462
Hey, are you done already?

948
00:49:40,772 --> 00:49:42,138
Bloody idiot! I'm here for a water bottle.

949
00:49:47,251 --> 00:49:47,877
Here, take this, madam.

950
00:49:50,084 --> 00:49:51,155
What is that tablet for, madam?

951
00:49:58,146 --> 00:49:58,798
For energy.

952
00:49:59,198 --> 00:50:00,934
You are three members. 
Don't I need energy?

953
00:50:01,034 --> 00:50:01,802
Oh, you are right!

954
00:50:02,196 --> 00:50:03,467
-Will you give me one? 
-I have only one tablet.

955
00:50:03,567 --> 00:50:05,021
Oh! No, ma'am. I have full energy.

956
00:50:05,321 --> 00:50:06,548
What's the delay then? Come here.

957
00:50:06,956 --> 00:50:08,932
Madam, you shouldn't rush me, madam.

958
00:50:09,258 --> 00:50:10,383
Actually, I have some doubts.

959
00:50:10,683 --> 00:50:11,502
I want to clarify them.

960
00:50:11,602 --> 00:50:12,754
What is your problem, dude?

961
00:50:14,288 --> 00:50:16,205
-Two minutes, madam. 
-What for?

00:50:21,197 --> 00:50:22,517
Thank you. Thank you, madam.

963
00:50:23,228 --> 00:50:24,149
I'll come soon.

964
00:50:29,343 --> 00:50:32,876
So many nights would come 
but this moon wouldn't come.

965
00:50:33,915 --> 00:50:36,073
I'll come. You'll give lots of kisses but

966
00:50:36,690 --> 00:50:37,994
there is no heat in them.

967
00:50:38,094 --> 00:50:38,683
Of course, it would be.

968
00:50:38,883 --> 00:50:40,217
And everything is in your hands.

969
00:50:40,531 --> 00:50:41,257
Tell me.

Yeah!

974
00:50:51,483 --> 00:50:53,723
Why is the watch running very slow?

975
00:50:54,285 --> 00:50:56,404
It's not slow. That idiot is taking time.

976
00:51:01,215 --> 00:51:02,332
-Uff... 
-Oh man!

977
00:51:02,801 --> 00:51:04,762

-He perspired all the water he drank.

978
00:51:04,962 --> 00:51:05,498
I'm next.

979
00:51:06,479 --> 00:51:07,549
-It's me. 
-Wait...

980
00:51:07,749 --> 00:51:08,318
What's up?

981
00:51:13,295 --> 00:51:14,209
Roll the dice.

982
00:51:16,143 --> 00:51:17,318
I'll be the next.

983
00:51:17,916 --> 00:51:18,837
I'll leave.

984
00:51:19,406 --> 00:51:20,327
You wait.

985
00:51:21,591 --> 00:51:22,027
I wish for my number.

986
00:51:26,286 --> 00:51:27,628
-Mine! 
-Hey, sit down!

987
00:51:28,443 --> 00:51:29,174
Can't hold his horses.

988
00:51:31,411 --> 00:51:32,788
Ill-fate. Bad omen.

989
00:51:33,277 --> 00:51:34,664
Worst! Crap!

990
00:51:35,062 --> 00:51:35,484
Oh!

00:51:36,595 --> 00:51:38,115
-Yeah! Yes! Yes! 
-Ah!

00:51:38,234 --> 00:51:40,059
-Hey... 
-I'll go. Please let me go.

993
00:51:40,359 --> 00:51:41,431
Hey, get lost.

994
00:51:44,581 --> 00:51:46,886
"Who are you, dear? Who are you, dear?"

995
00:51:49,458 --> 00:51:51,159
The Vaastu isn't good here. 
Let me go there and roll.

996
00:51:54,779 --> 00:51:55,365
One.

997
00:51:56,079 --> 00:51:56,783
Oh no!

998
00:51:59,082 --> 00:51:59,793
Crap!

999
00:52:00,163 --> 00:52:02,169
Well, I'm the only remaining person. 
Why do I need to roll the dice?

1000
00:52:13,224 --> 00:52:13,793

I'm number one forever.

1004
00:52:32,395 --> 00:52:33,710
Ah! It's okay.

1005
00:52:34,082 --> 00:52:35,912
Even though if there are no one, 
I'm number one.

1006
00:52:38,902 --> 00:52:39,835
May I come in?

1007
00:52:44,439 --> 00:52:45,307
Sorry for the late.

1008
00:52:56,542 --> 00:52:58,958
He didn't say it. 
You should have said at least.

1009
00:52:59,258 --> 00:53:02,016
He didn't tell me. 
That's why I didn't tell you.

[sobing in unison]

1011
00:53:13,088 --> 00:53:14,592
-How did you kill her like that? 
-How?

1012
00:53:14,947 --> 00:53:16,533
How did you kill her like that?

1013
00:53:23,023 --> 00:53:25,229
Hey, what actually happened was...

1014
00:53:25,965 --> 00:53:28,038
Yeah! I'm ready.

1015
00:53:29,614 --> 00:53:32,411
Leone... Oh, Sunny Leone!

1016
00:53:33,901 --> 00:53:36,019
Ah! Madam...

1017
00:53:39,590 --> 00:53:40,614
Madam...

1018
00:53:43,412 --> 00:53:44,360
Madam!

1019
00:53:46,013 --> 00:53:47,326
Madam!

1020
00:53:47,784 --> 00:53:48,926
That is what happened.

1021
00:53:49,435 --> 00:53:52,095
Hey, 
you should have said it before we went in!

1022
00:53:52,370 --> 00:53:53,761
-Aha! 
-Why did you trap us?

1023
00:53:53,861 --> 00:53:56,231
So, I shall become victim serving jail

1024
00:53:56,497 --> 00:53:58,283
and both of you would visit jail and 
hand me Biryani packets as witnesses?

1025
00:53:58,617 --> 00:53:59,265

I swear on my mother, 
I've paid it at the beginning itself.

Do I look like dead body disposer?

01:03:48,638 --> 01:03:50,068
-Was everything okay? 
-Hmm...

1196
01:03:51,294 --> 01:03:52,456
Was your journey good?

1197
01:03:54,474 --> 01:03:55,364
Sorry.

1198
01:03:58,420 --> 01:03:59,961
-Hey Phani... 
-Hmm...

1199
01:04:01,769 --> 01:04:02,883
You didn't have any problem, right?

1200
01:04:03,083 --> 01:04:03,746
Hey...

1201
01:04:03,946 --> 01:04:05,590
[whimpers]

1202
01:04:05,902 --> 01:04:06,872
Sleep!

1203
01:04:08,450 --> 01:04:09,636
Didn't you see anything?

1204
01:04:11,049 --> 01:04:12,546
-Go to sleep... 
-Don't pester me.

1205
01:04:12,873 --> 01:04:13,817
Sleep...

1206
01:04:14,154 --> 01:04:15,613
Bloody! She appears only to me.

1207
01:04:16,033 --> 01:04:17,091
What might be his situation?

1208
01:04:17,446 --> 01:04:18,004
Hey Anand...

1209
01:04:18,507 --> 01:04:19,426
A1!

1210
01:04:21,116 --> 01:04:22,974
[snores] Damn! 
Why should she appear only to me?

1211
01:04:25,135 --> 01:04:26,068
[indistinct carrom coins clatter]

1212
01:04:31,228 --> 01:04:33,600
Come my prince, let's play.

1213
01:04:33,700 --> 01:04:34,444
It's okay, come...

1214
01:04:40,273 --> 01:04:40,829
Thank God...

1215
01:04:43,022 --> 01:04:44,096
Won't you come when I call you?

1216
01:04:44,861 --> 01:04:46,229
Do you need to roll the dice for this too?

1217
01:04:46,429 --> 01:04:47,282
Oh God!

1218
01:04:47,482 --> 01:04:49,618
-I'm asking you. Just come! 
-No, I won't.

1219
01:04:59,457 --> 01:05:00,525
Where is the water bottle?

1220
01:05:04,030 --> 01:05:05,638
[retches]

1221
01:05:05,838 --> 01:05:08,165
Oh, booze! [coughs]

1222
01:05:09,348 --> 01:05:12,308
[coughs]

1223
01:05:29,750 --> 01:05:31,188
What is the direction of the feet?

1224
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:35,769
They are in opposite direction!

1225
01:05:40,676 --> 01:05:41,477
What happened, dude?

1226
01:05:45,013 --> 01:05:46,376
I too saw her.

1227
01:05:48,671 --> 01:05:51,391
I saw her... a while ago.

1228
01:05:51,609 --> 01:05:54,350
She made me pee and appeared later.

1229
01:05:54,643 --> 01:05:55,345
Oh no!

1230
01:05:55,545 --> 01:05:58,836
We two are trapped, 
only he's is in the safe zone.

1231
01:06:03,483 --> 01:06:05,305
Ask him to go.

1232
01:06:16,148 --> 01:06:18,978
Pooja...

1233
01:06:24,210 --> 01:06:26,959
[snores]

1234
01:06:27,613 --> 01:06:31,646
Oh, Pooja... No, Pooja...

1235
01:06:35,790 --> 01:06:37,340
What is it, Pooja?

1236
01:06:40,213 --> 01:06:45,542
[bellows]

1237
01:06:48,149 --> 01:06:50,436
What, dude? You too?

1238
01:06:51,988 --> 01:06:53,148
I was the first person.

1239
01:06:56,287 --> 01:06:57,552
Don't know what might have happened.

1240
01:06:59,810 --> 01:07:00,227
Oh no!

1241
01:07:03,556 --> 01:07:04,311
My granny told me...

1242
01:07:04,511 --> 01:07:09,050
[pants] People who died with 
unfulfilled wishes return as spirits.

1243
01:07:09,745 --> 01:07:10,919
Hey... What shall we do now?

1244
01:07:13,191 --> 01:07:16,633
If we get tempted by mistake and 
go to the ghost as she called us,

1245
01:07:17,348 --> 01:07:20,118
we'll be smothered in the dark.

1246
01:07:20,570 --> 01:07:21,707
Oh no! Oh my God!

1247
01:07:23,385 --> 01:07:25,377
What shall we do now?

1248
01:07:25,577 --> 01:07:30,594
Hey, won't your granny say useful 
things other than scary ones?

1249
01:07:30,694 --> 01:07:31,618
She does.

1250
01:07:31,818 --> 01:07:32,666
What is it?

1251
01:07:32,879 --> 01:07:36,912
in such times, 
if three men get up and scream

1252
01:07:37,012 --> 01:07:38,055
the ghost would flee.

1253
01:07:38,255 --> 01:07:40,275
-One minute. I'll be right back. 
-Where are you going?

1254
01:07:40,968 --> 01:07:42,495
-You've asked for three men, right? 
-Yes.

1255
01:07:42,654 --> 01:07:43,902
They are in the apartment below our floor. 
I'll get them.

1256
01:07:44,102 --> 01:07:46,802
-Go... Go... 
-Damn you!

1257
01:07:48,471 --> 01:07:49,309
Sorry, dude.

1258
01:07:49,509 --> 01:07:51,946
You've forgotten that we're men, did you?

1259
01:07:52,146 --> 01:07:53,092
Indeed!

1260
01:07:53,292 --> 01:07:55,841
Hey, what shall we do now? I have an idea.

1261
01:07:55,941 --> 01:07:56,538
Yes, tell me.

1262
01:07:56,992 --> 01:07:59,573
We'll count one, two and three.

1263
01:07:59,773 --> 01:08:01,543
We shall get up and scream loudly.

1264
01:08:01,743 --> 01:08:03,878
-Then, the ghost would flee. 
-Yes, you are right.

1265
01:08:04,078 --> 01:08:06,818
-Start. 
-Shall we count in Telugu or English?

1266
01:08:07,018 --> 01:08:09,951
-In English. It won't understand. 
-One...

1267
01:08:10,990 --> 01:08:11,939
Two...

1268
01:08:12,650 --> 01:08:13,699
Say three

1269
01:08:14,028 --> 01:08:15,188
I already did.

1270
01:08:15,388 --> 01:08:19,604
[whimpers] The voice isn't coming out.

1271
01:08:19,866 --> 01:08:21,835
I'll do something. I'll say it.

1272
01:08:22,035 --> 01:08:22,926
-Go ahead, dude. 
-[mumbles]

1273
01:08:23,486 --> 01:08:26,831
Hey, the voice isn't coming out.

1274
01:08:29,429 --> 01:08:30,072
Three!

1275
01:08:30,358 --> 01:08:33,318
[pants]

1276
01:08:38,134 --> 01:08:39,018
It's a dream!

1277
01:08:40,165 --> 01:08:41,566
It scared the hell out of me. Oh man!

1278
01:08:44,334 --> 01:08:45,128
Oh!

1279
01:08:46,850 --> 01:08:47,853
Good morning, dude.

1280
01:08:48,736 --> 01:08:49,852
Why aren't these guys talking?

1281
01:08:50,386 --> 01:08:52,494
Oh man! Hangover!

1282
01:08:55,593 --> 01:08:57,764
Hey, did you sleep well last night?

1283
01:08:59,252 --> 01:09:00,849
My foot! My foot dude!

1284
01:09:01,329 --> 01:09:02,569
She appeared in my dream as a ghost.

1285
01:09:02,769 --> 01:09:04,087
I was scared as hell all night.

1286
01:09:04,287 --> 01:09:06,041
Then, Phani might have 
romanced with the ghost too.

1287
01:09:06,241 --> 01:09:07,695
He didn't even leave the maid!

1288
01:09:08,797 --> 01:09:09,515
Thanks.

1289
01:09:10,718 --> 01:09:13,539
Well, 
why are unusually reading a newspaper?

1290
01:09:13,739 --> 01:09:15,618
To check whether our last night's 
murder has been reported or not.

1291
01:09:15,988 --> 01:09:17,383
You fool! What murder?

1292
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,615
I've meant, to check whether our last 
night's deed has been reported or not.

1293
01:09:20,865 --> 01:09:24,108
Be updated guys. How would midnight 
news appear in next morning's newspaper?

1294
01:09:24,308 --> 01:09:25,898
You are right. 
Let's watch it on YouTube then.

1295
01:09:27,522 --> 01:09:31,010
Hey, give some courage to a scared person. 
Don't scare him more.

1296
01:09:32,333 --> 01:09:33,040
Damn!

1297
01:09:33,480 --> 01:09:34,225
It didn't show up.

1298
01:09:34,425 --> 01:09:35,772
Hey, can't you hold your horses?

1299
01:09:36,018 --> 01:09:37,878
Are you eager to get caught?

1300
01:09:39,810 --> 01:09:41,902
[sighs] Oh...

1301
01:09:42,728 --> 01:09:43,673
We did a mistake.

1302
01:09:45,454 --> 01:09:47,044
We did a terrible mistake 
by getting that woman.

1303
01:09:47,801 --> 01:09:50,363
No, dude. We shouldn't have 
boozed in the first place.

1304
01:09:50,686 --> 01:09:52,081
Look who is talking about booze.

1305
01:09:52,772 --> 01:09:56,171
That's right! 
What you said is right, dude.

1306
01:09:57,219 --> 01:09:58,519
Like they show in the 
prelude of the films...

1307
01:09:58,823 --> 01:10:00,743
about smoking and drinking 
being harmful to health,

1308
01:10:01,043 --> 01:10:02,163
Instead,

1309
01:10:02,667 --> 01:10:04,372
they should state they 
are harmful to life.

1310
01:10:05,865 --> 01:10:07,363
-So... 
-So...

1311
01:10:07,563 --> 01:10:09,124
-Let's pledge. 
-Let's pledge.

1312
01:10:09,324 --> 01:10:09,919
Let's pledge.

1313
01:10:15,135 --> 01:10:16,262
I, Phani...

1314
01:10:17,094 --> 01:10:19,990
-I, Santosh... 
-I, Anand...

1315
01:10:20,090 --> 01:10:23,418
-will never touch booze again 
-as it has harmed our lives

1316
01:10:23,510 --> 01:10:24,855
will never touch it until 
this problem is resolved.

1317
01:10:25,015 --> 01:10:27,493
-Huh? 
-[mumbles]

1318
01:10:29,954 --> 01:10:30,674
-Hmm... 
-Okay.

1319
01:10:32,137 --> 01:10:35,166
-Will never get girls 
-and women too,

1320
01:10:35,366 --> 01:10:36,918
-Oh! 
-We'll not get them until we resolve this.

1321
01:10:42,134 --> 01:10:45,403
-We'll respect women. 
-We'll respect maids too.

1322
01:10:45,603 --> 01:10:47,050
We'll give everything along with respect.

1323
01:10:49,932 --> 01:10:50,733
Sorry.

1324
01:10:51,007 --> 01:10:52,732
-This is my oath! 
-This is my oath!

1325
01:10:53,217 --> 01:10:56,430
-Why don't you say it? 
-Yeah... oath!

1326
01:10:56,630 --> 01:10:58,479
Say it right. Wholeheartedly.

1327
01:10:58,679 --> 01:10:59,955
This is my oath!

1328
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:02,427
[knocking on door]

1329
01:11:02,698 --> 01:11:05,310
Hey, can it be a policeman?

1330
01:11:05,510 --> 01:11:05,924
Hey

1331
01:11:06,832 --> 01:11:08,375
You're always scared like an idiot.

1332
01:11:10,550 --> 01:11:11,652
-Go and check. 
-Ah...

1333
01:11:12,105 --> 01:11:12,922
Go now...

1334
01:11:14,121 --> 01:11:15,025
-[knocking on door] Hey... 
-Hey...

1335
01:11:15,826 --> 01:11:16,546
You go...

1336
01:11:19,945 --> 01:11:20,891
Go... [knocking on door]

1337
01:11:23,153 --> 01:11:23,804
Go...

1338
01:11:24,186 --> 01:11:25,276
Oh! [knocking on door]

1339
01:11:28,204 --> 01:11:28,979
Who is it?

1340
01:11:43,155 --> 01:11:44,803
We'll repect maids too.

1341
01:11:51,380 --> 01:11:52,415
It's the maid.

1342
01:11:56,427 --> 01:11:57,241
Ms Apranji.

1343
01:11:58,441 --> 01:11:59,592
You don't come from today.

1344
01:12:00,558 --> 01:12:02,526
-From now on, send your mother. 
-Why?

1345
01:12:03,737 --> 01:12:06,372
Ms Apranji, we don't want you 
to work here. Send your mother.

1346
01:12:06,582 --> 01:12:08,259
-Why? 
-My foot! My foot!

1347
01:12:09,883 --> 01:12:11,382
-Leave, please. 
-Damn!

1348
01:12:11,582 --> 01:12:12,552
I got it.

1349
01:12:20,329 --> 01:12:22,475
[sighs]

1350
01:12:23,654 --> 01:12:24,463
[sighs]

1351
01:12:25,390 --> 01:12:26,477
Damn! It turned cold.

1352
01:12:29,649 --> 01:12:30,613
It's okay, dude.

1353
01:12:32,481 --> 01:12:34,234
-It's okay, dude. 
-It's okay, dude. Don't pester.

1354
01:12:36,006 --> 01:12:38,230
[phone rings]

1355
01:12:40,942 --> 01:12:43,142
Hey, this phone call might be 
definitely from a policeman.

1356
01:12:43,342 --> 01:12:46,290
Hey, the wild fire ain't in Australia, 
it's right here.

1357
01:12:46,390 --> 01:12:47,739
Hey, stay silent for a while.

1358
01:12:50,651 --> 01:12:51,663
-Hello 
-Hello

1359
01:12:52,658 --> 01:12:54,015
-Hello... 
-Hello, who is it?

1360
01:12:54,215 --> 01:12:56,445
Hello, I can't hear your voice properly.

1361
01:12:56,645 --> 01:12:58,330
Hey, she is definitely a woman constable.

1362
01:12:58,530 --> 01:13:00,010
Madam... Madam... 
I don't have anything to do with that.

1363
01:13:00,210 --> 01:13:01,152
These two guys are 
responsible for everything.

1364
01:13:01,352 --> 01:13:04,105
-[mumbles] 
-What, sir? I'm Tulasi, sir.

1365
01:13:04,305 --> 01:13:06,935
I'm calling from Bank of Balanagar. 
It's about personal loan, sir.

1366
01:13:07,149 --> 01:13:08,799
Hey... you got scared, didn't you?

1367
01:13:09,264 --> 01:13:10,839
Fool! Damn you!

1368
01:13:14,791 --> 01:13:15,640
Look, Ms Tulasi.

1369
01:13:15,928 --> 01:13:17,086
-That's an audio call 
-Tell me, sir.

1370
01:13:18,254 --> 01:13:19,088
That's an audio, dude.

1371
01:13:20,492 --> 01:13:22,892
Don't call me for some days. 
I'm having some important work.

1372
01:13:23,092 --> 01:13:25,706
Sorry, sir. Sorry for the disturbance. 
Have a great day.

1373
01:13:25,906 --> 01:13:26,866
Okay... Day and night.

1374
01:13:29,651 --> 01:13:31,116
Hey, we might get caught because of him.

1375
01:13:31,372 --> 01:13:32,507
No, it's because of you.

1376
01:13:32,607 --> 01:13:34,997
-Hey, are you mad? 
-Stop it, guys! Stop it!

1377
01:13:35,593 --> 01:13:38,997
Hey, we'll find a solution 
for the problem if possible.

1378
01:13:39,652 --> 01:13:40,861
As we don't have that chance,

1379
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:42,874
we shall stay silent 
until we get a problem.

1380
01:13:43,074 --> 01:13:44,597
[knocking on door]

1381
01:13:44,797 --> 01:13:45,663
We got the problem.

1382
01:13:48,456 --> 01:13:50,113
-Who is it? 
-Hmm...

1383
01:13:51,211 --> 01:13:52,309
Got it, I will check.

1384
01:14:06,453 --> 01:14:07,663
Who is it? [man groans]

1385
01:14:10,747 --> 01:14:11,713
-Sir... 
-Out of the way...

1386
01:14:11,913 --> 01:14:13,169
Sir, what do you want?

1387
01:14:14,205 --> 01:14:15,428
Sir... Sir...

1388
01:14:15,628 --> 01:14:16,748
-Why are you throwing them down? 
-Talk to us.

1389
01:14:17,414 --> 01:14:18,996
Sir, who are you?

1390
01:14:20,292 --> 01:14:21,154
Sir, what do you want?

1391
01:14:21,690 --> 01:14:23,060
-Tell me, sir. 
-Sir... Sir...

1392
01:14:23,260 --> 01:14:23,975
Please sir...

1393
01:14:24,175 --> 01:14:25,098
Sir... Sir... [man humming]

1394
01:14:25,298 --> 01:14:26,259
What... What do you want, sir?

1395
01:14:26,599 --> 01:14:27,943
Hey... Sir...

1396
01:14:29,916 --> 01:14:31,450
-Sir, why aren't you responding? 
-Hey!

1397
01:14:32,647 --> 01:14:34,044
How dare you lay your 
hands on a policeman!

1398
01:14:34,144 --> 01:14:36,735
Sir... Sir... Sorry, sir... 
Sir... Please, sir...

1399
01:14:36,835 --> 01:14:40,489
As you aren't wearing a uniform, 
I didn't think you were a police. Sir...

1400
01:14:42,149 --> 01:14:42,669
Yes, sir...

1401
01:14:43,321 --> 01:14:44,857
Sir... Sir... Please remove the gun. 
Please, sir.

1402
01:14:56,169 --> 01:14:58,238
When you don't know who came inside, 
know them and behave accordingly,

1403
01:14:58,438 --> 01:14:59,424
instead of acting smart.

1404
01:15:04,864 --> 01:15:05,644
How many members?

1405
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:07,769
How many members stay in this house?

1406
01:15:08,804 --> 01:15:09,562
Just the three of us, sir.

1407
01:15:12,586 --> 01:15:14,714
Was it just you three who did 
it or was there anyone else?

1408
01:15:15,060 --> 01:15:16,060
What are you talking, sir?

1409
01:15:16,260 --> 01:15:17,651
Don't test my patience.

1410
01:15:18,411 --> 01:15:20,915
You'd live if you testify on your own.

1411
01:15:21,893 --> 01:15:23,604
If you make me extract the truth from you,

1412
01:15:23,712 --> 01:15:25,544
you'd be dead without 
even getting punished.

1413
01:15:26,907 --> 01:15:27,954
Will you tell the truth and live,

1414
01:15:28,154 --> 01:15:29,529
or stay mum and die?

1415
01:15:29,729 --> 01:15:30,728
Sir... I will say it.

1416
01:15:31,001 --> 01:15:32,969
We brought a hooker. 
She was with us at night.

1417
01:15:33,169 --> 01:15:35,223
I don't know anything, sir. 
She died unexpectedly.

1418
01:15:35,489 --> 01:15:37,230
-We don't know how she died, sir. 
-Hmm...

1419
01:15:37,430 --> 01:15:40,697
[phone rings]

1420
01:15:42,388 --> 01:15:42,934
Tell me, Ramana.

1421
01:15:43,134 --> 01:15:44,439
-Sir, there was small mistake. 
-Ha...

1422
01:15:45,101 --> 01:15:46,788
Those drug peddlers aren't 
staying in that house now.

1423
01:15:47,873 --> 01:15:50,459
Some others are residing there.

1424
01:15:50,659 --> 01:15:51,904
Hmm... I'll handle it.

1425
01:15:52,104 --> 01:15:52,949
-Okay, sir. 
-Okay.

1426
01:15:59,213 --> 01:16:00,568
Now, tell me what had happened.

1427
01:16:00,768 --> 01:16:01,988
Er... The girl came...

1428
01:16:02,935 --> 01:16:04,029
We've booked her.

1429
01:16:05,233 --> 01:16:07,281
But she died after she came here.

1430
01:16:07,481 --> 01:16:09,062
-We don't know anything. 
-She died by herself.

1431
01:16:09,262 --> 01:16:11,090
-True, sir. 
-Sir... Sir... I swear, sir...

1432
01:16:11,290 --> 01:16:11,925
-I swear on my mother, sir. 
-I swear

1433
01:16:12,125 --> 01:16:13,038
-Believe us, sir. 
-I was the first person to go to her.

1434
01:16:13,238 --> 01:16:14,769
Then, he went and later, it was him.

1435
01:16:15,079 --> 01:16:16,587
She died without anyone 
doing anything to her, sir.

1436
01:16:16,787 --> 01:16:17,788
Yes, sir, that's the truth.

1437
01:16:17,988 --> 01:16:18,775
We don't know anything, sir.

1438
01:16:18,975 --> 01:16:20,195
-Believe us, sir. 
-Please spare us.

1439
01:16:20,504 --> 01:16:22,089
We have disposed the body somewhere.

1440
01:16:22,602 --> 01:16:23,437
That's it, sir.

1441
01:16:23,637 --> 01:16:24,090
[mobile camera blips]

1442
01:16:24,312 --> 01:16:25,274
Tsk... Tsk... Tsk...

1443
01:16:26,587 --> 01:16:27,645
How did you get trapped in that way?

1444
01:16:29,070 --> 01:16:32,120
I can't find an option 
to save you in any way.

1445
01:16:32,554 --> 01:16:34,169
Even if you escape from Brothel case,

1446
01:16:34,510 --> 01:16:35,941
you can't escape from murder case.

1447
01:16:38,043 --> 01:16:40,222
Three of you would get sentenced 
for seven years for sure!

1448
01:16:40,422 --> 01:16:41,141
-Seven years! 
-Seven years?

1449
01:16:41,341 --> 01:16:43,129
You might get seven years of 
prison or even the death penalty.

1450
01:16:44,764 --> 01:16:46,767
There is no chance you escape the law.

1451
01:16:46,967 --> 01:16:48,535
Sir, can't we do anything with the law?

1452
01:16:48,735 --> 01:16:50,501
Well... 
We can't do anything if we don't want to

1453
01:16:50,701 --> 01:16:52,912
-or do anything if we want to. 
-What can we do, sir?

1454
01:16:53,112 --> 01:16:56,079
To do anything with the law, 
the one who runs the law can only do it.

1455
01:16:56,323 --> 01:16:56,991
Who is he, sir?

1456
01:16:57,191 --> 01:16:59,027
[laughs] Are you a software employee?

1457
01:16:59,227 --> 01:17:00,856
-Yes, sir. 
-I like you.

1458
01:17:01,503 --> 01:17:02,810
-That's me. 
-Thank you, sir.

1459
01:17:03,010 --> 01:17:05,059
As I feel pity seeing you...

1460
01:17:05,313 --> 01:17:07,742
As I'm believing that you 
didn't commit this crime,

1461
01:17:09,042 --> 01:17:11,481
I'll close the case if three of 
you pay me thirty lakh rupees.

1462
01:17:11,681 --> 01:17:12,603
-Thirty lakhs? 
-Thirty lakhs?

1463
01:17:14,696 --> 01:17:16,640
-Hey... 
-We don't have such amount, sir.

1464
01:17:17,471 --> 01:17:18,998
[scoffs] How come you are so shocked?

1465
01:17:19,895 --> 01:17:22,857
Atleast that amount is needed 
to close a murder case.

1466
01:17:22,957 --> 01:17:24,568
-Sir, we didn't commit the murder. 
-Sir, we didn't commit the murder.

1467
01:17:25,152 --> 01:17:26,761
By the way, I'm a good-natured person.

1468
01:17:27,247 --> 01:17:30,450
You need not arrange it immediately. 
Take a week time.

1469
01:17:30,650 --> 01:17:32,909
-Thirty lakh rupees in one week? 
-How, sir?

1470
01:17:33,009 --> 01:17:35,591
If you come up with excuses saying 
you couldn't arrange the money,

1471
01:17:35,896 --> 01:17:37,881
I'll shoot you like birds.

1472
01:17:43,052 --> 01:17:46,104
It is easier to close an 
encounter case than a murder case.

1473
01:17:46,566 --> 01:17:48,224
Seven days, thirty lakhs.

1474
01:17:49,203 --> 01:17:49,947
Sir...

1475
01:17:54,394 --> 01:17:56,425
How can we arrange thirty 
lakh rupees in seven days?

1476
01:17:59,098 --> 01:18:00,457
He tells that we'd be 
sentenced for seven years.

1477
01:18:03,439 --> 01:18:06,501
I did a mistake... I did a mistake...

1478
01:18:06,990 --> 01:18:10,845
"Would the heat of the moment"

1479
01:18:11,800 --> 01:18:15,538
"become shackles within seconds?"

1480
01:18:16,759 --> 01:18:20,552
"Would all the happiness"

1481
01:18:21,498 --> 01:18:25,087
"turn into your past at this moment?"

1482
01:18:25,454 --> 01:18:29,876
"The hopes which touched the sky"

1483
01:18:30,314 --> 01:18:34,677
"have shattered today"

1484
01:18:35,541 --> 01:18:39,366
"The wound in your heart"

1485
01:18:40,416 --> 01:18:44,033
"is on the verge of hitting your life"

1486
01:18:45,137 --> 01:18:49,042
"Would the journey become a burden?"

1487
01:18:49,937 --> 01:18:54,164
"Would the eyes become teary?"

1488
01:19:03,017 --> 01:19:03,874
Anand...

1489
01:19:07,583 --> 01:19:09,693
Why are here in the office at this time?

1490
01:19:12,894 --> 01:19:14,744
-You still remember it, right? 
-Yes, madam. I do.

1491
01:19:15,250 --> 01:19:16,726
One week, thirty lakhs.

1492
01:19:17,456 --> 01:19:18,567
What are you talking?

1493
01:19:19,462 --> 01:19:20,788
What are you talking about, madam?

1494
01:19:21,544 --> 01:19:25,428
Is it that you want to hear 
everything from me? You naughty!

1495
01:19:26,648 --> 01:19:28,446
Me? Naughty?

1496
01:19:28,646 --> 01:19:30,318
Ah! Forget this.

1497
01:19:30,655 --> 01:19:33,817
I'll arrange everything by 11 am sharp. 
Come to my home.

1498
01:19:34,297 --> 01:19:35,138
Please, madam.

1499
01:19:35,543 --> 01:19:37,271
I plead you. Leave me.

1500
01:19:37,537 --> 01:19:38,550
Are you okay?

1501
01:19:39,235 --> 01:19:41,437
I'm not okay, madam. I'm not okay.

1502
01:19:42,061 --> 01:19:44,095
Ah! You are completely sick!

1503
01:19:47,781 --> 01:19:48,603
Damn!

1504
01:19:49,551 --> 01:19:50,888
[sighs]

1505
01:19:52,755 --> 01:19:56,682
[phone rings]

1506
01:20:01,642 --> 01:20:03,023
-What happened? 
-Sir...

1507
01:20:03,745 --> 01:20:06,700
I'm having a bad situation. 
I need half-day leave, sir.

1508
01:20:06,900 --> 01:20:09,360
We can't look at you when you are normal. 
And you bring that expression...

1509
01:20:10,084 --> 01:20:10,680
Alright, go.

1510
01:20:11,323 --> 01:20:11,864
Thank you, sir.

1511
01:20:15,359 --> 01:20:16,902
Men chasing woman: Hey... 
Hey... Stop... Hey... Stop...

1512
01:20:17,102 --> 01:20:18,103
Men chasing woman: Stop... 
She is running away...

1513
01:20:18,303 --> 01:20:19,831
-Woman: Save me... 
-Men chasing woman: Catch her.

1514
01:20:20,010 --> 01:20:21,049
Men chasing woman: Run faster. 
[knocking on door]

1515
01:20:21,305 --> 01:20:23,425
Men chasing woman: Stop... 
-Woman: Save me please! [knocking on door]

1516
01:20:23,658 --> 01:20:24,505
Men chasing woman: We got her.

1517
01:20:25,730 --> 01:20:28,040
[knocking on door]

1518
01:20:34,556 --> 01:20:35,481
-Huh... 
-Sir, save me.

1519
01:20:35,718 --> 01:20:37,656
-They are coming. Please save me. 
-Hey... Hey...

1520
01:20:37,856 --> 01:20:38,605
-Sir... 
-Who are you?

1521
01:20:38,805 --> 01:20:40,304
-Hey, I'm talking to you. 
-Please... Please...

1522
01:20:40,504 --> 01:20:41,902
-Close the door. They are coming. 
-What?

1523
01:20:42,259 --> 01:20:43,614
-Please, sir. 
-Who are they?

1524
01:20:44,038 --> 01:20:44,679
There are no one here.

1525
01:20:44,888 --> 01:20:46,997
They are those guys who 
booked me yesterday.

1526
01:20:47,221 --> 01:20:49,319
[panting] They are the ones... 
They will kill me, sir.

1527
01:20:49,519 --> 01:20:51,323
Hey, which three guys? 
There is no one here, right?

1528
01:20:51,725 --> 01:20:53,930
I got it. You are man too.

1529
01:20:54,541 --> 01:20:55,764
That's why you'd support them.

1530
01:20:56,630 --> 01:21:00,232
It is better to die on my own 
rather than getting killed by them.

1531
01:21:00,592 --> 01:21:02,181
Hey... Hey... What are you doing? [slits]

1532
01:21:02,745 --> 01:21:03,555

-Phew... 
-I'll take bath and come.

1535
01:21:25,429 --> 01:21:27,027
-Santosh... 
-Santosh...

1536
01:21:27,524 --> 01:21:29,475
Hey, what happened? 
Why are you sitting here?

1537
01:21:29,675 --> 01:21:31,366
Santosh, what happened, dude?

1538
01:21:32,231 --> 01:21:35,070
-What happened, dude? 
-Look at that girl... Look...

1539
01:21:35,939 --> 01:21:37,118
She is sitting there and looking at me.

1540
01:21:37,322 --> 01:21:38,819
-Where, dude? 
-She is dead but still looking at me.

1541
01:21:39,019 --> 01:21:39,869
-Who is she? 
-Where is she?

1542
01:21:40,069 --> 01:21:40,955
There she is man!

1543
01:21:41,337 --> 01:21:42,270
That girl is looking at me.

1544
01:21:42,470 --> 01:21:44,146
Hey Santosh, 
where is she and who is that girl?

1545
01:21:44,346 --> 01:21:46,456
Hey, we've left that woman there.

1546
01:21:46,656 --> 01:21:50,405
But this girl came inside when everyone 
was watching and killed herself.

1547
01:21:50,505 --> 01:21:51,408
Look, how she is staring at us.

1548
01:21:51,608 --> 01:21:54,041
Hey, we are doomed, guys! 
She will kill us.

1549
01:21:54,241 --> 01:21:55,526
-Hey... Hey... 
-You are having a high temperature.

1550
01:21:55,802 --> 01:21:57,225
-Come, let's go to the hospital. 
-Not to the hospital...

1551
01:21:57,458 --> 01:21:59,262
First, 
we have to take this dead body somewhere.

1552
01:21:59,462 --> 01:22:00,905
-Hey Santosh, forget it. 
-Santosh,

1553
01:22:01,005 --> 01:22:02,029
I'll handle that dead body.

1554
01:22:02,229 --> 01:22:04,088
-Come, let's go to the hospital first. 
-That girl is staring at me.

1555
01:22:04,288 --> 01:22:05,856
Please listen to me and come with us. 
Come quickly, dude.

1556
01:22:06,391 --> 01:22:07,111
-Hey... 
-Santosh!

1557
01:22:08,002 --> 01:22:08,412
Move...

1558
01:22:09,100 --> 01:22:10,886
Get up, dude. Get up.

1559
01:22:19,633 --> 01:22:20,144
[chuckles]

1560
01:22:20,968 --> 01:22:21,793
What happened again?

1561
01:22:22,002 --> 01:22:22,881
-We brought a girl. 
-Ah...

1562
01:22:23,081 --> 01:22:24,307
-She died. 
-Aha!

1563
01:22:24,507 --> 01:22:25,585
-We've disposed that girl. 
-Ah!

1564
01:22:25,876 --> 01:22:26,559
Hey...

1565
01:22:27,228 --> 01:22:28,839
-A girl came again. 
-I think I've to squeeze this now.

1566
01:22:29,166 --> 01:22:30,482
-She died again. 
-Oh!

1567
01:22:30,582 --> 01:22:32,163
-But we didn't bring the girl this time. 
-Ah!

1568
01:22:32,363 --> 01:22:33,874
Don't know why she came and why she died.

1569
01:22:35,610 --> 01:22:36,935
-This is the problem, sir. 
-Okay.

1570
01:22:37,893 --> 01:22:38,736
-I'll treat him. 
-Hmm...

1571
01:22:39,083 --> 01:22:41,110
This is the most typical case 
out of the cases that I've dealt.

1572
01:22:41,310 --> 01:22:42,273
-Oh! 
-[sighs]

1573
01:22:42,473 --> 01:22:43,779
I want...

1574
01:22:44,510 --> 01:22:45,537
I will study him...

1575
01:22:46,778 --> 01:22:47,466
Okay...

1576
01:22:49,490 --> 01:22:50,461
Give me some space.

1577
01:22:50,912 --> 01:22:51,882
Alright.

1578
01:22:52,788 --> 01:22:53,959
Now...

1579
01:22:54,287 --> 01:22:56,872
I will show you some difference 
between real and fake.

1580
01:22:59,711 --> 01:23:00,479
Aah!

1581
01:23:01,190 --> 01:23:01,864
That's is what!

1582
01:23:02,584 --> 01:23:04,149
What do you see in these two?

1583
01:23:05,105 --> 01:23:06,238
-Sunny Leone. 
-Sunny Leone.

1584
01:23:07,050 --> 01:23:07,829
What about this?

1585
01:23:08,029 --> 01:23:09,139
-Sunny Leone. 
-Sunny Leone.

1586
01:23:09,339 --> 01:23:10,303
What is she wearing in this image?

1587
01:23:10,503 --> 01:23:11,131
A saree...

1588
01:23:11,231 --> 01:23:12,120
-A saree 
-Are you able to see anything?

1589
01:23:12,220 --> 01:23:12,953
We can see nothing, sir.

1590
01:23:13,153 --> 01:23:14,556
-What is she wearing here? 
-She is wearing nothing, sir.

1591
01:23:14,756 --> 01:23:15,456
But everything...

1592
01:23:16,116 --> 01:23:17,166
You turn that side and write.

1593
01:23:18,042 --> 01:23:19,580
So, you think this is real.

1594
01:23:19,680 --> 01:23:21,685
But this isn't real. This is real.

1595
01:23:22,017 --> 01:23:24,051
This is illusion and this is truth.

1596
01:23:24,751 --> 01:23:26,061
-Did you understand? 
-No, sir.

1597
01:23:26,661 --> 01:23:29,430
That is the one. That is your problem.

1598
01:23:29,530 --> 01:23:30,413
It is very easy, right?

1599
01:23:30,613 --> 01:23:32,957
So, 
there are three stages of hallucination.

1600
01:23:33,157 --> 01:23:33,557
Ah!

1601
01:23:33,820 --> 01:23:35,641
First stage: You can hear.

1602
01:23:36,129 --> 01:23:38,302
-Second stage: You can see. 
-What about the third stage, sir?

1603
01:23:38,502 --> 01:23:39,174
She would slap you.

1604
01:23:39,374 --> 01:23:41,487
-What stage is he in, sir? 
-Advanced stage.

1605
01:23:41,687 --> 01:23:43,463
How can he be cured, sir?

1606
01:23:43,663 --> 01:23:45,661
From now on, if you feel sad, 
happy or feel like crying or laughing

1607
01:23:45,773 --> 01:23:47,064
or get into a problem or whatever...

1608
01:23:47,264 --> 01:23:49,996
just chew this. That's enough.

1609
01:23:51,706 --> 01:23:53,523
There is one more important 
thing that I have to tell you.

1610
01:23:53,599 --> 01:23:55,031
Take care of him carefully.

1611
01:23:55,231 --> 01:23:56,747
-Okay, sir. 
-He might trip sometimes.

1612
01:23:57,140 --> 01:23:59,845
Unable to distinguish between reality and 
a lie, he would worry and get confused.

1613
01:24:00,358 --> 01:24:01,960
So, you can go.

1614
01:24:02,992 --> 01:24:04,117
-Come, let's go. 
-Careful.

1615
01:24:04,975 --> 01:24:06,309
-Don't know what's this imagination. 
-Don't know, dude.

1616
01:24:21,034 --> 01:24:23,357
Oh! Phani... Anand...

1617
01:24:24,041 --> 01:24:25,248
-Hey 
-What happened, dude?

1618
01:24:25,448 --> 01:24:26,787
-Aunty... Aunty... 
-Aunty?

1619
01:24:27,335 --> 01:24:28,831
-Which Aunty? 
-Sunny Leone... Sunny Leone...

1620
01:24:28,931 --> 01:24:30,598
-[in unison]Where, dude? 
-Over there...

1621
01:24:32,240 --> 01:24:33,058
Who is over there, dude?

1622
01:24:33,625 --> 01:24:35,107
-What about this dice? 
-This dice?

1623
01:24:35,307 --> 01:24:36,615
-Who does it belong to? 
-Uncle...

1624
01:24:37,529 --> 01:24:39,473
-This is my dice, uncle. 
-Yours?

1625
01:24:40,426 --> 01:24:41,235
Thank you!

1626
01:24:42,495 --> 01:24:43,536
-Hell with your imagination! 
-Got it?

1627
01:24:44,255 --> 01:24:45,519
You... Move...

1628
01:24:50,973 --> 01:24:52,510
Why is she visible only to me...

1629
01:24:52,746 --> 01:24:54,434
-and no one else? 
-What's your problem?

1630
01:24:54,745 --> 01:24:55,700
Nothing, keep moving.

1631
01:24:56,829 --> 01:24:59,701
[breathes heavily]

1632
01:25:04,790 --> 01:25:06,095
I don't understand his situation.

1633
01:25:08,831 --> 01:25:10,839
Hey, understand me later.

1634
01:25:11,425 --> 01:25:12,882
First, think about a way 
to dispose that dead body.

1635
01:25:13,082 --> 01:25:15,566
We'll take care of that dead body. 
Just squeeze that ball. Bloody ball!

1636
01:25:17,242 --> 01:25:17,949
-Sir, 
-Yes.

1637
01:25:18,324 --> 01:25:19,711
Please take that tablet. You...

1638
01:25:22,348 --> 01:25:25,099
The cop is already giving us tough 
time for the crime we didn't commit.

1639
01:25:25,199 --> 01:25:26,681
And he has come up with a new case!

1640
01:25:27,334 --> 01:25:28,676
Seems like we might get his madness.

1641
01:25:28,876 --> 01:25:32,814
Yes. Seems like we'd get our 
death if we don't pay that amount.

1642
01:25:33,465 --> 01:25:35,853
It is not just one or two... 
Thirty lakh rupees!

1643
01:25:36,199 --> 01:25:37,371
What shall be done to earn such amount?

1644
01:25:38,292 --> 01:25:40,246
Yes, dude. What shall we do now?

1645
01:25:45,601 --> 01:25:47,667
Hey, why are you talking crap like madmen?

1646
01:25:48,067 --> 01:25:49,980
First, think about the ways to pay 
thirty lakh rupees to the policeman.

1647
01:25:50,081 --> 01:25:51,533
We'll think about it, 
you continue squeezing it.

1648
01:26:04,964 --> 01:26:06,075
[door creaks] May I come in, sir?

1649
01:26:15,846 --> 01:26:17,676
-Sir 
-What?

1650
01:26:17,876 --> 01:26:19,411
I need some money urgently, sir.

1651
01:26:19,611 --> 01:26:22,160
-What for? 
-Life and death problem, sir.

1652
01:26:22,881 --> 01:26:24,137
Please do something and help me, sir.

1653
01:26:24,237 --> 01:26:25,180
How much amount?

1654
01:26:26,466 --> 01:26:28,767
-I need five to six lakh rupees, sir. 
-What?

1655
01:26:29,202 --> 01:26:31,174
Yes, sir. It is very urgent, sir.

1656
01:26:31,749 --> 01:26:33,335
-You have to... 
-That's tough.

1657
01:26:33,535 --> 01:26:34,940
Sir, please...

1658
01:26:35,410 --> 01:26:37,353
Please help me, sir.

1659
01:26:37,716 --> 01:26:41,955
Look, this topic shouldn't come 
between us so that I won't get angry.

1660
01:26:42,262 --> 01:26:43,090
That's it.

1661
01:26:43,290 --> 01:26:44,095
-You may leave now. 
-Sir...

1662
01:26:44,822 --> 01:26:46,155
I said, you may leave now.

1663
01:26:51,589 --> 01:26:52,811
-Santosh 
-Sir...

1664
01:26:53,135 --> 01:26:54,726
What have you done with 
the monthly report file?

1665
01:26:56,424 --> 01:27:00,191
Within two days... [phone rings]

1666
01:27:00,333 --> 01:27:01,353
Excuse me, sir.

1667
01:27:02,792 --> 01:27:04,399
-Hello 
-Hello sir. I'm Tulasi.

1668
01:27:04,599 --> 01:27:08,371
I have recently called you from Bank 
of Balanagar regarding personal loan.

1669
01:27:08,471 --> 01:27:11,495
Thank God! 
You have called at the right time.

1670
01:27:11,983 --> 01:27:14,358
-I want the loan. Tell me what I should do 
-Okay, sir.

1671
01:27:14,558 --> 01:27:15,008
One minute...

1672
01:27:15,208 --> 01:27:16,077
Santosh,

1673
01:27:16,907 --> 01:27:19,359
I've asked you about the monthly 
report and you are leaving?

1674
01:27:20,055 --> 01:27:21,617
-One minute, Ms Tulasi. 
-Okay, sir.

1675
01:27:24,119 --> 01:27:24,937
What the hell!

1676
01:27:26,696 --> 01:27:27,726
-Sorry, ma'am. 
-No problem, sir.

1677
01:27:27,926 --> 01:27:29,768
Ms Tulasi, tell me.

1678
01:27:30,856 --> 01:27:31,501
What all documents do you need?

1679
01:27:31,701 --> 01:27:32,501
How many days would it take 
for the loan to get sanctioned?

1680
01:27:32,545 --> 01:27:33,765
It would take two days, sir.

1681
01:27:33,865 --> 01:27:35,357
I'll tell you the documents that we need.

1682
01:27:35,557 --> 01:27:38,887
Give your address and our executive 
would come and collect the documents.

1683
01:27:38,987 --> 01:27:40,823
Okay. Tell me what do you want. 
Hey, give me a pen.

1684
01:27:41,224 --> 01:27:43,779
Last six months bank statement,

1685
01:27:43,879 --> 01:27:46,014
-Three passport size photos, 
-Okay

1686
01:27:46,114 --> 01:27:47,819
-Three months payslips, 
-Aha!

1687
01:27:48,019 --> 01:27:50,898
Well, 
they should have your boss's signature too

1688
01:27:51,098 --> 01:27:54,244
and a letter from your company as 
a proof that you're working in it.

1689
01:27:54,444 --> 01:27:56,205
-Boss's signature. 
-Yes, sir.

1690
01:27:57,757 --> 01:27:58,702
Phew!

1691
01:27:59,326 --> 01:28:00,173
Sir...

1692
01:28:01,601 --> 01:28:03,110
Why didn't you tell this earlier, madam?

1693
01:28:03,210 --> 01:28:04,924
When did you let me speak all these days, 
sir?

1694
01:28:06,240 --> 01:28:07,883
Is there any problem, sir?

1695
01:28:08,403 --> 01:28:09,783
Err... There is no problem, madam.

1696
01:28:10,810 --> 01:28:12,175
-I'll handle it. 
-Well, sir...

1697
01:28:12,375 --> 01:28:13,896
The loan won't be sanctioned 
without the signature.

1698
01:28:13,988 --> 01:28:15,452
Understood, madam. I got it.

1699
01:28:16,366 --> 01:28:17,957
I will arrange all those 
documents and call you.

1700
01:28:18,049 --> 01:28:19,125
Okay, sir. Thank you.

1701
01:28:33,213 --> 01:28:38,539
Sir... You need to sign on the 
payslips for me to get a loan.

1702
01:28:43,923 --> 01:28:47,193
Scold whatever you want but 
please sign on the payslips.

1703
01:28:47,393 --> 01:28:50,415
Sign? Of course, I will do it. 
Not on your payslips...

1704
01:28:50,615 --> 01:28:52,238
but on your termination letter

1705
01:28:52,438 --> 01:28:53,830
Sir, please don't say that...

1706
01:28:54,030 --> 01:28:55,203
-I... 
-Get out of my cabin.

1707
01:28:55,403 --> 01:28:57,464
-Sir, please... 
-Get out of my cabin

1708
01:28:57,664 --> 01:28:58,700
and my company.

1709
01:29:04,989 --> 01:29:06,158
Santosh, wait...

1710
01:29:06,710 --> 01:29:08,357
-Sir? 
-Remember one thing.

1711
01:29:08,916 --> 01:29:10,800
I don't know what problem you are into.

1712
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:14,139
But never forget your job

1713
01:29:14,339 --> 01:29:15,444
and the food you eat.

1714
01:29:20,388 --> 01:29:23,621
Arrange for Santosh's payslips and 
other documents for my signature.

1715
01:29:30,195 --> 01:29:32,837
If you want anything else, 
I will get them arranged quickly.

1716
01:29:40,609 --> 01:29:42,682
Sir, thank you so much.

1717
01:29:45,706 --> 01:29:48,686
-Sir... Sir... 
-Hmm...

1718
01:29:49,006 --> 01:29:50,703
Phani, the writer has come. 
Shall I allow him to meet you?

1719
01:29:50,903 --> 01:29:51,600
Hmm...

1720
01:30:00,227 --> 01:30:02,681
-Sir. 
-Hmm, tell me.

1721
01:30:03,270 --> 01:30:05,238
-I'm in a bad situation, sir. 
-Hmm?

1722
01:30:05,502 --> 01:30:06,901
I'm in a bad situation, sir.

1723
01:30:08,358 --> 01:30:11,001
-You said you would give me ten lakhs... 
-Why?

1724
01:30:12,185 --> 01:30:13,511
You said that you 
wouldn't sell your faith!

1725
01:30:15,582 --> 01:30:16,713
It's my necessity, sir.

1726
01:30:17,677 --> 01:30:19,782
My necessity made me to 
put my faith at stake.

1727
01:30:21,361 --> 01:30:23,128
-If you can arrange those ten lakhs... 
-[scoffs]

1728
01:30:23,945 --> 01:30:27,933
Ten lakhs? It was back then. 
Now, it's just four lakhs.

1729
01:30:28,424 --> 01:30:29,741
-Why is it so, sir? 
-That's all.

1730
01:30:30,765 --> 01:30:32,234
The price fluctuates depending on the day.

1731
01:30:33,089 --> 01:30:34,860
Tell me if you are okay 
to sell it for four lakhs.

1732
01:30:36,818 --> 01:30:39,414
I agree, sir.

1733
01:30:41,508 --> 01:30:42,995
Money can buy anything.

1734
01:30:44,181 --> 01:30:47,170
At last, I couldn't even 
withstand on my word for it.

1735
01:30:47,551 --> 01:30:49,353
Please, sir. Arrange at least five lakhs.

1736
01:30:50,407 --> 01:30:51,015
Please, sir.

1737
01:30:52,166 --> 01:30:53,044
Raju.

1738
01:31:02,497 --> 01:31:06,974
"Did the version of the story change?"

1739
01:31:07,292 --> 01:31:11,374
"Would the turmoil in the heart stop?"

1740
01:31:11,991 --> 01:31:16,060
"Did the version of the story change?"

1741
01:31:16,972 --> 01:31:20,831
"Would the turmoil in the heart stop?"

1742
01:31:21,711 --> 01:31:25,562
"You wrote this story"

1743
01:31:26,378 --> 01:31:30,217
"God wrote your story"

1744
01:31:31,265 --> 01:31:35,044
"The life search for the faith"

1745
01:31:36,114 --> 01:31:40,112
"And you sold it"

1746
01:31:40,811 --> 01:31:45,029
"Did the version of the story change?"

1747
01:31:45,781 --> 01:31:49,818
"Would the turmoil in the heart stop?"

1748
01:32:09,932 --> 01:32:13,930
"Your expectation doesn't 
come true as reality"

1749
01:32:14,846 --> 01:32:18,619
"It happens unexpectedly"

1750
01:32:19,721 --> 01:32:23,871
"Your mistake has proved to be too costly"

1751
01:32:24,448 --> 01:32:28,050
"And changed your path"

1752
01:32:28,451 --> 01:32:32,803
"You killed the dreams..."

1753
01:32:33,227 --> 01:32:37,559
"...within you"

1754
01:32:38,443 --> 01:32:42,109
"The wound inside your heart..."

1755
01:32:43,230 --> 01:32:47,047
"...might cost you, your life at last"

1756
01:32:52,203 --> 01:32:53,566
What happened, uncle?

1757
01:32:53,766 --> 01:32:56,379
It's nothing, dear. I fell off my bike.

1758
01:32:56,390 --> 01:32:59,889
Then, why don't you ride safely, uncle?

1759
01:33:01,270 --> 01:33:02,430
I was riding safely.

1760
01:33:03,066 --> 01:33:05,868
The other guy came in the 
wrong route and hit me.

1761
01:33:07,073 --> 01:33:09,328
Uncle, is it paining?

1762
01:33:11,232 --> 01:33:11,784
No, dear.

1763
01:33:12,917 --> 01:33:15,977
It's not paining after seeing 
your smile and talking with you.

1764
01:33:16,077 --> 01:33:18,872
Is it so? 
Even my mother says the same thing.

1765
01:33:19,091 --> 01:33:19,650
What does she say?

1766
01:33:19,850 --> 01:33:23,422
All her worries would vanish 
by seeing my smile it seems.

1767
01:33:24,689 --> 01:33:25,458
It's true, dear.

1768
01:33:26,122 --> 01:33:28,386
The doctor has asked me 
to give you an injection.

1769
01:33:28,523 --> 01:33:29,613
-Give me Rs. 200. 
-Oh!

1770
01:33:30,291 --> 01:33:30,838
One minute.

1771
01:33:34,696 --> 01:33:36,127
Sorry, I don't have cash.

1772
01:33:36,631 --> 01:33:38,122
My friends will be here in a few minutes.

1773
01:33:38,522 --> 01:33:40,116
-They'll pay you, sorry. 
-Here, take it, uncle.

1774
01:33:40,448 --> 01:33:41,334
Take it.

1775
01:33:42,514 --> 01:33:43,432
Why are you giving, dear?

1776
01:33:44,659 --> 01:33:47,134
That is your money. Keep it safe with you.

1777
01:33:47,334 --> 01:33:48,550
My friends will come and pay the amount.

1778
01:33:48,750 --> 01:33:52,809
I took this money from my 
mother to buy chocolates.

1779
01:33:52,909 --> 01:33:55,928
I'll again take it 
tomorrow if I want to have.

1780
01:33:56,128 --> 01:33:58,304
First, you take it, uncle.

1781
01:33:58,404 --> 01:34:00,865
No, dear. That money was 
given by your mother to you.

1782
01:34:01,453 --> 01:34:02,911
Which means, only you should spend them.

1783
01:34:03,460 --> 01:34:04,759
You keep it with you and buy chocolates.

1784
01:34:04,959 --> 01:34:08,806
Uncle, 
I'll not have dinner if you don't take it.

1785
01:34:09,411 --> 01:34:12,323
Take it, sir. Else that baby 
would insist to have the dinner.

1786
01:34:17,046 --> 01:34:17,586
Thank you.

1787
01:34:22,531 --> 01:34:24,857
-Hey Santosh! What happened? 
-What happened?

1788
01:34:26,821 --> 01:34:28,227
Someone came in the 
wrong route and hit me.

1789
01:34:28,427 --> 01:34:29,734
-Are you okay now? 
-Yeah, I'm okay.

1790
01:34:29,934 --> 01:34:31,722
Hey! First, give Rs. 500 to that baby.

1791
01:34:33,520 --> 01:34:34,527
-Yeah, here it is. 
-Give.

1792
01:34:36,224 --> 01:34:37,632
Here it is, take it.

1793
01:34:37,832 --> 01:34:40,587
-I don't want, uncle. 
-What happened, dear?

1794
01:34:41,128 --> 01:34:42,145
You just gave me, didn't you?

1795
01:34:42,345 --> 01:34:43,337
-Take it. 
-Take it, now.

1796
01:34:43,537 --> 01:34:47,673
Now you would forget me 
if I take this money.

1797
01:34:48,671 --> 01:34:52,824
If not, you'll remember me.

1798
01:34:53,024 --> 01:34:54,370
[chuckles]

1799
01:34:54,749 --> 01:34:56,800
Anyway, what happened to you?

1800
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:57,848
Why are you alone here?

1801
01:34:58,109 --> 01:35:00,488
They say that there is 
a boogeyman in my brain.

1802
01:35:00,893 --> 01:35:03,317
A boogeyman named brain tumour.

1803
01:35:06,965 --> 01:35:09,813
Then where are you parents, dear?

1804
01:35:10,013 --> 01:35:11,513
I don't have father.

1805
01:35:12,924 --> 01:35:15,427
My mother went to bring amount.

1806
01:35:15,771 --> 01:35:21,487
They say, both my mother's and my savings 
wouldn't be sufficient to cure my pain.

1807
01:35:22,701 --> 01:35:25,777
I should save money for so many days.

1808
01:35:26,329 --> 01:35:29,794
But I don't have so many days, uncle.

1809
01:35:37,549 --> 01:35:38,939
By the way, what is your name, dear?

1810
01:35:39,139 --> 01:35:39,880
Laxmi.

1811
01:35:46,036 --> 01:35:46,819
Take care, dear.

1812
01:35:48,232 --> 01:35:48,699
I'll leave.

1813
01:35:48,899 --> 01:35:49,453
-Bye. 
-Bye, dear.

1814
01:35:49,653 --> 01:35:51,715
Don't come here again, uncle.

1815
01:35:52,278 --> 01:35:52,750
Bye.

1816
01:36:17,713 --> 01:36:18,262
What happened?

1817
01:36:19,904 --> 01:36:21,446
That baby's words are stopping me.

1818
01:36:24,172 --> 01:36:25,065
Yes.

1819
01:36:25,711 --> 01:36:26,789
What shall we do?

1820
01:36:28,128 --> 01:36:29,313
What's her age?

1821
01:36:30,598 --> 01:36:32,366
How can she die with 
the lack of treatment?

1822
01:36:35,825 --> 01:36:37,939
She gave all her saved money for me.

1823
01:36:40,312 --> 01:36:44,193
We should give her some 
money from the money we have.

1824
01:36:45,714 --> 01:36:46,550
Let's give her.

1825
01:36:47,197 --> 01:36:48,172
-Let's give her. 
-Okay.

1826
01:36:48,490 --> 01:36:49,623
Let's go to the doctor.

1827
01:36:49,823 --> 01:36:50,491
Let's go.

1828
01:36:50,691 --> 01:36:52,766
-Excuse me, sir. 
-Come in.

1829
01:36:54,146 --> 01:36:55,156
Come, please sit down.

1830
01:36:56,693 --> 01:36:57,787
-Sir. 
-Hello, sir.

1831
01:36:58,188 --> 01:37:00,706
-Who looks after the patient Laxmi? 
-Whom are you referring to?

1832
01:37:00,906 --> 01:37:02,328
I mean the baby...

1833
01:37:02,568 --> 01:37:04,139
-...with the brain tumour. 
-Yeah, please tell me.

1834
01:37:04,239 --> 01:37:05,557
Doctor, 
how much it costs for the operation?

1835
01:37:06,758 --> 01:37:09,042
It costs around 18 to 20 lakhs.

1836
01:37:09,516 --> 01:37:12,340
-18 to 20 lakhs...? 
-18 to 20 lakhs...

1837
01:37:12,925 --> 01:37:15,399
Because the specialists 
should come from the US.

1838
01:37:15,827 --> 01:37:19,032
Sir, there will be NGOs to 
help such people, aren't they?

1839
01:37:19,232 --> 01:37:20,380
Is there any possibility to contact them?

1840
01:37:20,580 --> 01:37:21,645
The problem is that...

1841
01:37:22,110 --> 01:37:25,039
...the cost of the medicines is 
higher than the lives of the people.

1842
01:37:26,223 --> 01:37:28,205
You are right. There are NGOs.

1843
01:37:28,405 --> 01:37:29,219
-Sir... 
-But...

1844
01:37:29,615 --> 01:37:31,121
There are so many pending cases with them.

1845
01:37:32,048 --> 01:37:33,602
-The baby doesn't have much time. 
-In unison: Thank you.

1846
01:37:41,569 --> 01:37:44,386
Sir, they say it'd take two days for 
the patient to gain consciousness.

1847
01:37:45,289 --> 01:37:46,913
That MLA is troubling me.

1848
01:37:47,459 --> 01:37:50,009
You do one thing. Take their 
family into custody and hit them.

1849
01:37:50,209 --> 01:37:52,164
-They'd automatically tell you. Go. 
-Okay, sir.

1850
01:37:55,085 --> 01:37:55,768
Hey! There is a policeman.

1851
01:38:01,275 --> 01:38:02,311
[whistles]

1852
01:38:03,486 --> 01:38:03,929
Hey!

1853
01:38:04,757 --> 01:38:05,779
-Hey! Let's go. 
-Hey!

1854
01:38:06,755 --> 01:38:07,453
Wait there.

1855
01:38:09,440 --> 01:38:10,766
What are you doing here?

1856
01:38:11,416 --> 01:38:14,176
-Sir, he met with an accident. 
-Oh!

1857
01:38:14,376 --> 01:38:15,399
Where?

1858
01:38:15,637 --> 01:38:16,696
-Hey! 
-It's here.

1859
01:38:16,896 --> 01:38:18,316
For such a small accident?

1860
01:38:18,828 --> 01:38:20,629
Are you aware of the third degree I give?

1861
01:38:21,461 --> 01:38:23,013
I mean, if you don't pay up.

1862
01:38:25,449 --> 01:38:27,221
Hey IT! How is your mother?

1863
01:38:27,421 --> 01:38:29,073
-Hmm... Yes, sir. 
-Take care of your mother.

1864
01:38:31,426 --> 01:38:32,386
You have two days of time.

1865
01:38:45,580 --> 01:38:47,127
You have two days of time.

1866
01:38:50,338 --> 01:38:52,194
The baby doesn't have much time.

1867
01:39:04,878 --> 01:39:08,098
Chinna, listen to me carefully.

1868
01:39:08,298 --> 01:39:09,503
What is it, Laxmi?

1869
01:39:09,951 --> 01:39:11,984
When you have an opportunity to help...

1870
01:39:13,483 --> 01:39:15,727
...help without a second thought.

1871
01:39:21,845 --> 01:39:25,345
I'll always be alive in the help you do.

1872
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:32,292
I think my mother is testing me again.

1873
01:39:34,844 --> 01:39:39,454
I lost my mother, Laxmi in my 
childhood as I didn't have money.

1874
01:39:42,507 --> 01:39:45,440
And now despite being an elder 
and having the money too...

1875
01:39:46,832 --> 01:39:47,935
I can't lose this Laxmi.

1876
01:39:50,303 --> 01:39:51,951
To keep my mother's my promise,

1877
01:39:53,423 --> 01:39:54,519
this girl should be saved.

1878
01:39:57,735 --> 01:39:59,327
I'll give all my money to the girl.

1879
01:40:02,195 --> 01:40:04,964
It's not just your money. It's our money.

1880
01:40:05,497 --> 01:40:06,455
Yes.

1881
01:40:07,187 --> 01:40:08,395
Though we are endangered,

1882
01:40:10,727 --> 01:40:11,794
the girl's life is important.

1883
01:40:14,626 --> 01:40:15,576
And we are saving her.

1884
01:40:26,031 --> 01:40:27,171
[bike arriving]

1885
01:40:40,207 --> 01:40:42,029
Hey! What happened?

1886
01:40:45,757 --> 01:40:46,494
What happened?

1887
01:40:47,614 --> 01:40:48,389
It's nothing.

1888
01:40:49,182 --> 01:40:50,035
Tell me.

1889
01:40:54,274 --> 01:40:55,257
Tell me, what happened?

1890
01:40:56,459 --> 01:40:59,369
There was a ride on my mother's 
groceries store in my village.

1891
01:41:01,561 --> 01:41:02,708
Ride on a groceries store?

1892
01:41:03,740 --> 01:41:05,828
-For what? 
-It was a drug case, it seems.

1893
01:41:08,258 --> 01:41:09,476
How could there be drugs 
in a groceries store?

1894
01:41:10,472 --> 01:41:12,157
Our problem followed my home.

1895
01:41:13,395 --> 01:41:16,137
He is the one doing all of these.

1896
01:41:24,401 --> 01:41:27,624
I'm scared of what my 
mother will go through.

1897
01:41:28,326 --> 01:41:33,467
Hey! Nothing will happen to your mother.

1898
01:41:34,427 --> 01:41:35,769
All of these has happened because of me.

1899
01:41:38,814 --> 01:41:39,938
It's not because of you.

1900
01:41:41,430 --> 01:41:42,790
-It's because of me. 
-Hey!

1901
01:41:44,478 --> 01:41:46,878
Don't repeat it, 
that's the reason I came out alone.

1902
01:41:48,590 --> 01:41:50,754
Alright, let's go.

1903
01:41:50,954 --> 01:41:53,137
-You leave. I'll not come. 
-Hey! Come.

1904
01:41:53,930 --> 01:41:54,710
He is alone there.

1905
01:41:55,993 --> 01:41:57,908
Come, nothing will happen. I'm here.

1906
01:42:02,885 --> 01:42:04,789
[wind howling]

1907
01:42:05,237 --> 01:42:06,188
Hey Anand!

1908
01:42:08,614 --> 01:42:10,099
Hey! What is this?

1909
01:42:10,399 --> 01:42:10,966
What happened?

1910
01:42:12,031 --> 01:42:14,012
They've selected me to send to US on site.

1911
01:42:14,882 --> 01:42:17,751
For the first time in my life, I'm 
confused, whether to feel happy or sad.

1912
01:42:18,051 --> 01:42:20,215
Hey! Why are you behaving like a child?

1913
01:42:21,550 --> 01:42:24,265
Parents share just the happy 
moments with their children.

1914
01:42:25,130 --> 01:42:27,104
They hide the sorrow in them.

1915
01:42:28,203 --> 01:42:29,270
I still remember.

1916
01:42:30,312 --> 01:42:33,098
My mother fasted for so many 
days so that I can get a job.

1917
01:42:34,170 --> 01:42:35,754
She has sold her entire jewellery.

1918
01:42:37,248 --> 01:42:40,362
She is working hard there so 
that I can be comfortable here.

1919
01:42:41,689 --> 01:42:43,543
It's okay if I don't get them a building,

1920
01:42:44,179 --> 01:42:45,950
but I can't see them in a police station.

1921
01:42:48,475 --> 01:42:50,177
Despite them knowing that 
I made such a mistake,

1922
01:42:50,565 --> 01:42:52,491
I feel that my death news 
would be much better for them.

1923
01:42:52,691 --> 01:42:53,167
-Hey! 
-Hey!

1924
01:42:53,367 --> 01:42:53,900
Hey Anand!

1925
01:42:54,370 --> 01:42:55,573
Have you gone crazy?

1926
01:42:56,064 --> 01:42:57,926
Hey! Nothing will happen to you.

1927
01:42:58,467 --> 01:42:59,291
Not just you...

1928
01:42:59,567 --> 01:43:01,712
your mother, 
your father or no one will be hurt.

1929
01:43:02,724 --> 01:43:05,454
I'm there for you... Hey! 
I'm there for you...

1930
01:43:05,852 --> 01:43:08,047
You believe me, don't you? 
Nothing will happen to us.

1931
01:43:08,247 --> 01:43:09,498
Hey! Take care of him.

1932
01:43:10,122 --> 01:43:11,640
Hey! I'll bring a nice coffee.

1933
01:43:13,640 --> 01:43:14,377
You don't worry.

1934
01:43:15,463 --> 01:43:16,590
Hey! Take care of him.

1935
01:43:24,755 --> 01:43:30,723
"What is this question without an answer?"

1936
01:43:31,452 --> 01:43:37,352
"What might be its 
answer until it's found?"

1937
01:43:39,096 --> 01:43:45,021
"There were three joyful birds"

1938
01:43:45,870 --> 01:43:51,269
"They are falling down wings broken"

1939
01:43:51,395 --> 01:43:56,963
"Did the fate play a conspiracy?"

1940
01:43:58,067 --> 01:44:02,524
"Did the dreams vanish to these eyes?"

1941
01:44:04,731 --> 01:44:10,558
"This is not the story and 
the entire life is a wretch"

1942
01:44:15,182 --> 01:44:16,246
My name is Santosh.

1943
01:44:17,332 --> 01:44:21,155
I'm working in a company Inner 
Feelings as a marketing executive.

1944
01:44:22,628 --> 01:44:27,191
I made a mistake and it led to a problem.

1945
01:44:27,965 --> 01:44:32,167
After knowing this, CA Shatruv if we 
don't give thirty lakhs in a week...

1946
01:44:33,035 --> 01:44:36,944
...he threatened that he would arrest us 
under a wrong case and spoil our lives.

1947
01:44:38,677 --> 01:44:40,468
But they are not related to it.

1948
01:44:41,633 --> 01:44:42,473
It's my mistake.

1949
01:44:43,965 --> 01:44:45,180
Kindly spare them.

1950
01:44:46,815 --> 01:44:47,961
I gave it a thought.

1951
01:44:48,737 --> 01:44:54,280
I've decided to suicide 
as the mistake is mine.

1952
01:44:55,768 --> 01:44:56,939
Don't harm my friends.

1953
01:44:57,755 --> 01:44:58,851
Kindly spare them.

1954
01:45:02,140 --> 01:45:03,396
Miss you guys.

1955
01:45:04,266 --> 01:45:07,019
[sobbing]

1956
01:45:09,744 --> 01:45:12,624
"You've shown me mother's love"

1957
01:45:13,122 --> 01:45:15,636
"You've lent me your help"

1958
01:45:16,492 --> 01:45:19,376
"You've been righteous"

1959
01:45:19,864 --> 01:45:22,301
"You stood beside me"

1960
01:45:23,061 --> 01:45:25,854
"Even though the problem isn't yours"

1961
01:45:26,515 --> 01:45:29,339
"You've come forward to join"

1962
01:45:29,866 --> 01:45:32,867
"But when your friend are dying"

1963
01:45:33,067 --> 01:45:35,655
"What options are you left with?"

1964
01:45:35,855 --> 01:45:36,857
I give you two days.

1965
01:45:38,531 --> 01:45:44,511
"Would the trouble take leave now?"

1966
01:45:45,321 --> 01:45:50,826
"Won't you oppose it and 
continue your journey?"

1967
01:45:52,103 --> 01:45:58,043
"Would you sacrifice your 
live to give life to others?"

1968
01:46:07,691 --> 01:46:09,398
-Santosh! Santosh! 
-Hey Santosh!

1969
01:46:10,035 --> 01:46:11,379
-Santosh! 
-Hey Santosh!

1970
01:46:11,823 --> 01:46:12,780
Santosh!

1971
01:46:19,803 --> 01:46:20,836
You idiot!

1972
01:46:21,270 --> 01:46:22,415
You thought of leaving us alone!

1973
01:46:23,264 --> 01:46:24,796
You didn't even mention 
our names in the video!

1974
01:46:25,372 --> 01:46:26,648
You thought of taking 
the blame on yourself?

1975
01:46:27,592 --> 01:46:28,693
What else do I do?

1976
01:46:30,085 --> 01:46:31,464
We can't pay up.

1977
01:46:32,682 --> 01:46:34,134
So, we can't get out of this case.

1978
01:46:35,318 --> 01:46:36,962
I could only think of one thing.

1979
01:46:38,411 --> 01:46:39,774
This was the only way I could think.

1980
01:46:39,953 --> 01:46:44,282
So? If you die, how could we be 
happy even if we get out of the case?

1981
01:46:45,566 --> 01:46:46,934
I didn't think about that.

1982
01:46:48,088 --> 01:46:50,064
I just thought no harm should come to you.

1983
01:46:51,876 --> 01:46:53,186
I'm nothing.

1984
01:46:54,087 --> 01:46:55,366
I'm an orphan.

1985
01:46:56,510 --> 01:46:58,386
My dad was gone before 
I came into this world.

1986
01:46:59,434 --> 01:47:03,029
And I lost the mother who 
got me into this world.

1987
01:47:04,555 --> 01:47:05,695
But you...

1988
01:47:07,070 --> 01:47:09,237
You've got families that love you a lot.

1989
01:47:10,747 --> 01:47:12,456
But me?

1990
01:47:14,664 --> 01:47:15,791
You're the family I got.

1991
01:47:16,207 --> 01:47:17,232
Crazy fellow...

1992
01:47:18,233 --> 01:47:19,503
Whom do we both have too.

1993
01:47:20,579 --> 01:47:22,010
How could we survive without you?

1994
01:47:23,369 --> 01:47:24,481
Not this way...

1995
01:47:24,681 --> 01:47:26,566
-Hey... take pledge. 
-Huh?

1996
01:47:26,766 --> 01:47:27,322
-Take pledge. 
-Take pledge.

-Sorry, lift you hand.

whatever the circumstances be...

2003
01:47:42,926 --> 01:47:44,786
...won't commit silly things like suicide,

2004
01:47:45,952 --> 01:47:47,217
and if there's another birth...

2005
01:47:48,578 --> 01:47:50,056
we will take birth as friends again,

2006
01:47:51,051 --> 01:47:53,647
Dude, let's take birth 
along with our girl friends.

2007

[both laughing]

2008
01:47:59,062 --> 01:48:00,032
I'm sorry.

2010
01:48:04,980 --> 01:48:05,793
Hello?

2011
01:48:05,993 --> 01:48:07,312
-I'm the doctor treating Lakshmi. 
-Sir...

2012
01:48:07,703 --> 01:48:08,998
It's time for her operation.

2013
01:48:09,477 --> 01:48:11,625
She is asking for you, 
can you make it here?

2014
01:48:12,470 --> 01:48:14,515
Sir, we'll be there in 30 minutes.

2015
01:48:15,282 --> 01:48:16,626
-Who is it? 
-Who's it dude?

2016
01:48:17,572 --> 01:48:19,316
It's time for the girl's operation.

2017
01:48:19,979 --> 01:48:21,468
She wants to see us once.

2018
01:48:21,965 --> 01:48:23,668
-Okay, let's go. 
-Let's start to the hospital.

2019
01:48:23,739 --> 01:48:25,852
Won't she feel bad seeing our dull faces?

2020
01:48:27,066 --> 01:48:28,340
-Start... 
-Okay.

2021
01:48:35,816 --> 01:48:37,003
-Sir... 
-We've just sedated her.

2022
01:48:37,593 --> 01:48:39,402
It's time to get her operated. 
We have to take her in.

2023
01:48:40,302 --> 01:48:41,503
Come. Make it fast.

2024
01:48:43,860 --> 01:48:44,982
-Take her. 
-Take her.

2025
01:48:45,182 --> 01:48:46,203
Careful...

2026
01:48:47,415 --> 01:48:49,675
All the best dear... bye.

2027
01:48:50,151 --> 01:48:50,987
Bye.

[Santosh clears throat]

2029
01:49:07,894 --> 01:49:10,672
Guys, I'll have some water.

2030
01:49:21,498 --> 01:49:22,352
Damn!

2031
01:49:23,032 --> 01:49:25,240
Why don't you show yourself to 
that cop than targeting me always?

2032
01:49:26,176 --> 01:49:27,889
A cop? Which cop?

2033
01:49:28,019 --> 01:49:29,027
Ah!

2034
01:49:29,735 --> 01:49:30,768
As if she doesn't know it!

2035
01:49:31,095 --> 01:49:32,947
Don't know why you came and were dead...

2036
01:49:33,075 --> 01:49:34,277
you ruined our lives.

2037
01:49:34,782 --> 01:49:36,774
That cop is behind our 
lives after you died.

2038
01:49:38,938 --> 01:49:41,033
Well that aside, who is that girl?

2039
01:49:41,591 --> 01:49:43,995
Why are you three paying to save her?

2040
01:49:47,438 --> 01:49:48,689
Her name is Lakshmi.

2041
01:49:50,005 --> 01:49:51,023
It's my mother's name.

2042
01:49:52,344 --> 01:49:56,778
She reminded me of my mother's 
words and instigated humanity in us.

2043
01:49:58,431 --> 01:50:00,560
That's why we took the responsibility 
of getting her operated.

2044
01:50:01,635 --> 01:50:03,851
[lady sighs] Hmm...

2045
01:50:04,439 --> 01:50:06,570
I thought you guys just pay 
girls to sleep with them.

2046
01:50:06,784 --> 01:50:08,297
Do you indulge in such charity too?

2047
01:50:08,914 --> 01:50:09,672
[Santosh scoffs]

2048
01:50:09,765 --> 01:50:11,254
It's no good telling you all this.

2049
01:50:12,585 --> 01:50:15,329
How would a lady who's in flesh 
trade know anything about humanity?

2050
01:50:23,014 --> 01:50:24,130
Huh!

2051
01:50:27,819 --> 01:50:29,258
I'll tell this to my friends!

2052
01:50:31,828 --> 01:50:33,887
She always scares only me.

2053
01:50:34,856 --> 01:50:36,375
These guys won't even understand.

2054
01:50:42,516 --> 01:50:44,475
-Huh? 
-What's wrong with him?

2055
01:50:48,965 --> 01:50:50,058
What now?

2056
01:50:52,540 --> 01:50:53,753
The lady hit me.

2057
01:50:54,398 --> 01:50:55,333
[both sigh]

2058
01:50:55,533 --> 01:50:56,917
She showed herself in the first step.

2059
01:50:57,366 --> 01:50:59,531
She was audible at the second 
level and hit him at the third.

2060
01:51:00,019 --> 01:51:01,134
She really slapped me.

2061
01:51:02,839 --> 01:51:04,098
-Did she hit you hard? 
-Yeah.

2062
01:51:04,554 --> 01:51:05,505
You'll be fine.

2063
01:51:06,492 --> 01:51:07,777
[in unison]: Damn you!

2064
01:51:12,415 --> 01:51:13,604
That's okay, you'll be fine.

2065
01:51:14,896 --> 01:51:15,976
Okay.

2066
01:51:19,511 --> 01:51:20,511
[yawns]

2067
01:51:30,859 --> 01:51:31,599
[door opens]

2068
01:51:36,157 --> 01:51:36,939
Gentlemen!

2069
01:51:37,291 --> 01:51:38,949
Come on get up! The operation is done.

2070
01:51:39,149 --> 01:51:40,093
Hey, get up.

2071
01:51:41,529 --> 01:51:42,545
How is the kid doctor?

2072
01:51:43,097 --> 01:51:44,383
By god's grace, nothing to worry.

2073
01:51:44,658 --> 01:51:45,686
She's all fine.

2074
01:51:46,153 --> 01:51:47,976
She'll take sometime to 
regain consciousness.

2075
01:51:48,271 --> 01:51:49,559
You can go home, relax and come back.

2076
01:51:50,037 --> 01:51:50,710
-Cheer up. 
-Thank you, sir.

2077
01:51:50,910 --> 01:51:51,894
Thank you so much, sir.

2078
01:51:54,204 --> 01:51:55,075
Let's go.

2079
01:52:19,847 --> 01:52:21,446
Dude, shut the door.

2080
01:52:31,471 --> 01:52:32,500
Are you here?

2081
01:52:32,700 --> 01:52:33,944
We just had a chat last night.

2082
01:52:34,370 --> 01:52:35,835
You can't come right in the morning!

2083
01:52:36,398 --> 01:52:37,927
Come in the night, I'll be free to talk.

2084
01:52:38,415 --> 01:52:39,271
Come back tonight.

2085
01:52:39,471 --> 01:52:40,536
She just doesn't understand.

2086
01:52:41,132 --> 01:52:42,475
Keeps coming at any time.

2087
01:52:42,675 --> 01:52:43,680
Who's that?

2088
01:52:43,880 --> 01:52:46,920
It's the lady. She just comes down 
as if we are free all the time.

2089
01:52:49,180 --> 01:52:50,292
I asked her to come back at night.

2090
01:52:51,294 --> 01:52:52,715
What? Won't he be fine ever?

2091
01:52:53,229 --> 01:52:54,397
Ah! His hallucinations!

2092
01:52:55,050 --> 01:52:55,951
Strange!

2093
01:52:56,151 --> 01:52:57,889
[door knocking]

2094
01:52:58,890 --> 01:53:00,525
-Check the door. 
-Must be Aparanji.

2095
01:53:00,725 --> 01:53:02,291
Maybe it's the lady. Go.

2096
01:53:02,675 --> 01:53:04,245
-Tell her I'm busy. 
-He's gone bonkers.

2097
01:53:04,672 --> 01:53:05,940
Ask her to come back at night. We'll talk.

2098
01:53:06,040 --> 01:53:07,013
-Shut it. 
-Go.

2099
01:53:11,238 --> 01:53:13,402
She just keeps coming back and 
her mother doesn't like it.

2100
01:53:13,881 --> 01:53:14,984
What a pity!

2101
01:53:16,154 --> 01:53:16,835
[gasps]

2102
01:53:17,035 --> 01:53:18,469
What? Who's it?

2103
01:53:19,047 --> 01:53:20,173
[stammers]

2104
01:53:20,405 --> 01:53:21,745
Is hallucination contagious?

2105
01:53:22,403 --> 01:53:23,480
What happened?

2106
01:53:23,680 --> 01:53:24,777
Who's it, dude?

2107
01:53:29,252 --> 01:53:30,267
So you're here?

2108
01:53:30,467 --> 01:53:31,672
Haven't I told you a while ago?

2109
01:53:32,036 --> 01:53:33,702
Not to come as I'm busy with other works.

2110
01:53:33,902 --> 01:53:35,310
Why do you force yourself on me?

2111
01:53:35,842 --> 01:53:36,790
Come back in the night.

2112
01:53:37,498 --> 01:53:38,167
Hey!

2113
01:53:38,367 --> 01:53:39,249
-Dude! 
-Yeah?

2114
01:53:39,449 --> 01:53:40,894
What? What's it now?

2115
01:53:42,016 --> 01:53:43,447
Why? Should I only see her?

2116
01:53:43,856 --> 01:53:45,040
Haven't we three booked her together?

2117
01:53:45,240 --> 01:53:46,864
And you! You come in my dreams.

2118
01:53:47,064 --> 01:53:48,532
And it's me you hit me too.

2119
01:53:48,714 --> 01:53:49,875
There's something called justice!

2120
01:53:50,233 --> 01:53:52,713
You're beautiful, does that mean 
you could take me for granted?

2121
01:53:52,913 --> 01:53:54,352
-Are these two any pure souls? 
-Damn you!

2122
01:53:54,980 --> 01:53:56,931
This isn't hallucination as you think, 
this is for real!

2123
01:53:57,526 --> 01:53:58,843
Does that mean you're...

2124
01:53:59,043 --> 01:54:01,082
-Yes, I'm alive. 
-Huh!

2125
01:54:06,253 --> 01:54:07,755
If you have to know what happened...

2126
01:54:08,359 --> 01:54:10,917
you have to know what 
happened in my life first.

2127
01:54:12,173 --> 01:54:13,468
My name is Asha.

2128
01:54:14,030 --> 01:54:16,839
I came to Hyderabad to become an actress.

2129
01:54:17,039 --> 01:54:19,379
When I started trying for 
opportunities in films...

2130
01:54:19,579 --> 01:54:23,374
I found more people who take advantage of 
it than the ones who give opportunities.

2131
01:54:24,962 --> 01:54:25,983
As I was a loner...

2132
01:54:26,183 --> 01:54:27,565
life was hard.

2133
01:54:27,956 --> 01:54:29,560
My mother used to tell 
me when I was a child...

2134
01:54:30,080 --> 01:54:32,186
'You have a strong heart.'

2135
01:54:33,478 --> 01:54:36,207
But, what my mother didn't know was...

2136
01:54:37,167 --> 01:54:39,995
my heart isn't as strong as I am.

2137
01:54:44,989 --> 01:54:46,635
I suffer from a peculiar heart problem.

2138
01:54:47,760 --> 01:54:49,853
If someone is excited usually...

2139
01:54:50,074 --> 01:54:54,074
they stop in happiness or surprise.

2140
01:54:54,387 --> 01:54:55,993
But, if I'm exited...

2141
01:54:57,942 --> 01:54:59,127
My heart would stop.

2142
01:55:03,005 --> 01:55:04,279
The heart once stops,

2143
01:55:04,598 --> 01:55:07,590
the doctors won't be able to 
get it back to functioning.

2144
01:55:08,742 --> 01:55:10,146
Only god can.

2145
01:55:10,555 --> 01:55:14,323
But, you weren't even breathing then.

2146
01:55:15,080 --> 01:55:18,630
That day, 
I was almost at the gates of death.

2147
01:55:20,769 --> 01:55:21,699
But...

2148
01:55:23,881 --> 01:55:24,489
[thunderbolt strikes]

2149
01:55:24,689 --> 01:55:25,760
[gasps for breath]

2150
01:55:32,786 --> 01:55:36,078
I then understood why god 
brought me back to life.

2151
01:55:37,126 --> 01:55:38,251
It's for my Lakshmi.

2152
01:55:42,952 --> 01:55:46,392
I thought men who asked me if I 
was available when I was single...

2153
01:55:47,264 --> 01:55:49,495
would stop if I become a mother.

2154
01:55:49,995 --> 01:55:52,787
That's why I adopted 
Lakshmi who was an orphan.

2155
01:55:53,413 --> 01:55:56,183
Whatever sorrow or problems 
I'm going through...

2156
01:55:56,771 --> 01:56:00,381
The reason for the smile on my face is... 
my Lakshmi.

2157
01:56:04,905 --> 01:56:05,839
I'm ready!

2158
01:56:06,039 --> 01:56:08,198
Then guess how many are these?

2159
01:56:08,398 --> 01:56:09,195
Eleven!

2160
01:56:09,527 --> 01:56:12,480
So you can't see anything, catch me!

2161
01:56:19,117 --> 01:56:20,165
Where are you?

2162
01:56:20,718 --> 01:56:21,788
Mommy!

2163
01:56:21,988 --> 01:56:24,025
Oh! So there you are!

2164
01:56:27,435 --> 01:56:28,454
Lakshmi...

2165
01:56:28,714 --> 01:56:29,752
[thud sound]

2166
01:56:35,678 --> 01:56:36,495
Lakshmi...

2167
01:56:51,491 --> 01:56:52,549
Lakshmi!

2168
01:56:56,815 --> 01:56:57,905
Lakshmi!

2169
01:56:58,967 --> 01:57:01,032
Lakshmi... get up dear!

2170
01:57:01,832 --> 01:57:03,389
[sobbing] Lakshmi!

2171
01:57:14,583 --> 01:57:15,671
See Asha...

2172
01:57:17,012 --> 01:57:18,868
I don't understand how to 
convey this matter to you.

2173
01:57:19,068 --> 01:57:20,144
What happened doctor?

2174
01:57:21,281 --> 01:57:22,599
Your daughter shares the same fate as you, 
Asha.

2175
01:57:22,799 --> 01:57:24,370
What are you saying doctor?

2176
01:57:24,768 --> 01:57:26,011
What actually happened?

2177
01:57:26,353 --> 01:57:29,729
Even Lakshmi has a serious 
medical problem like you.

2178
01:57:32,112 --> 01:57:33,448
She won't live for long.

2179
01:57:35,878 --> 01:57:38,623
Not just you, 
but even I don't know when would you die.

2180
01:57:40,031 --> 01:57:41,947
But I know when Lakshmi would die.

2181
01:57:43,678 --> 01:57:46,245
You atleast have some time in your hand.

2182
01:57:47,375 --> 01:57:48,886
But Lakshmi only has a few days.

2183
01:57:55,109 --> 01:57:57,292
The operation is very expensive.

2184
01:57:58,697 --> 01:58:00,192
The cost would be around 20 lakhs.

2185
01:58:02,026 --> 01:58:04,614
That too, 
has to be performed within a week of time.

2186
01:58:07,690 --> 01:58:08,965
Within a week?

2187
01:58:10,218 --> 01:58:11,513
So much money?

2188
01:58:13,175 --> 01:58:15,743
Otherwise, I'll donate my kidney doctor.

2189
01:58:16,084 --> 01:58:18,177
You've told me someone was 
waiting for one since long!

2190
01:58:20,262 --> 01:58:23,050
It's not possible in the position 
you are currently in, Asha.

2191
01:58:32,710 --> 01:58:34,298
We have to administer an 
injection immediately.

2192
01:58:34,773 --> 01:58:36,759
That injection would work for 
a period of 24 hours only.

2193
01:58:37,099 --> 01:58:41,147
We have to administer one injection per 
day till the operation is performed.

2194
01:58:42,188 --> 01:58:45,497
Every injection would cost you 
from 50,000 to 60,000 bucks.

2195
01:58:48,965 --> 01:58:50,044
[whistling]

2196
01:58:51,624 --> 01:58:53,066
She looks damn beautiful dude!

2197
01:58:53,448 --> 01:58:55,601
We can shell out even a lakh 
of rupees for this beauty!

2198
01:58:56,151 --> 01:58:57,027
She's sexy.

2199
01:59:00,500 --> 01:59:04,121
They say god shows a way 
to the ones in deep sorrow.

2200
01:59:04,947 --> 01:59:07,524
Atleast, one day because of me...

2201
01:59:08,227 --> 01:59:12,015
there was a hope that I could make 
the kid live with one injection.

2202
01:59:12,839 --> 01:59:14,779
You called me exactly at the same time.

2203
01:59:16,290 --> 01:59:21,142
[voice muted]

2204
01:59:27,962 --> 01:59:31,470
I thought god showed 
me a way that day too.

2205
01:59:32,270 --> 01:59:34,075
My organs couldn't be of use anyhow.

2206
01:59:34,697 --> 01:59:38,221
I thought... 
atleast my beauty could save the kid.

2207
01:59:38,990 --> 01:59:41,583
That's why, 
I accepted your offer immediately.

2208
01:59:45,338 --> 01:59:46,371
Damn!

2209
01:59:51,135 --> 01:59:53,374
As you left me alone that day...

2210
01:59:53,830 --> 01:59:55,674
I thought I shouldn't meet you ever again.

2211
01:59:56,579 --> 02:00:00,541
But after knowing that you helped me and 
were stuck in problems because of me,

2212
02:00:00,976 --> 02:00:02,047
I came here.

2213
02:00:04,655 --> 02:00:05,868
God doesn't exist in special places.

2214
02:00:06,770 --> 02:00:08,560
God is present in the help we extend.

2215
02:00:09,519 --> 02:00:13,340
In the current mechanical life where 
no one helps even their own people

2216
02:00:14,605 --> 02:00:16,813
For a kid whom you are 
no way related to...

2217
02:00:17,013 --> 02:00:21,136
you've extended your help without 
even caring about your lives.

2218
02:00:21,910 --> 02:00:23,841
Really, you are gods.

2219
02:00:24,193 --> 02:00:25,248
Oh no...

2220
02:00:26,320 --> 02:00:28,128
How is Lakshmi now?

2221
02:00:28,932 --> 02:00:30,157
She's out of danger.

2222
02:00:31,479 --> 02:00:32,371
But...

2223
02:00:33,227 --> 02:00:36,144
I'd need another five lakhs 
for her further medication.

2224
02:00:36,344 --> 02:00:37,322
Five lakhs?

2225
02:00:37,419 --> 02:00:38,964
[door knocking]

2226
02:00:39,890 --> 02:00:40,833
One minute.

2227
02:00:42,467 --> 02:00:43,486
[door knocking]

2228
02:00:43,586 --> 02:00:45,142
Hey... the cop.

2229
02:00:45,661 --> 02:00:46,731
Ma'am, get inside.

2230
02:00:49,346 --> 02:00:50,364
What do we do now?

2231
02:01:06,431 --> 02:01:08,708
Can you turn off problems but 
switching your phones off?

2232
02:01:09,299 --> 02:01:10,103
Where is it?

2233
02:01:10,303 --> 02:01:11,104
What sir?

2234
02:01:11,304 --> 02:01:12,656
Where's the money man?

2235
02:01:13,139 --> 02:01:14,251
We don't have money sir.

2236
02:01:14,451 --> 02:01:15,531
-That's true sir. 
-Yes sir.

2237
02:01:16,193 --> 02:01:17,601
So you're ready to face it.

2238
02:01:18,066 --> 02:01:22,117
You'd know it if I bash up your 
families along with you in the station.

2239
02:01:22,916 --> 02:01:23,967
Call your families here.

2240
02:01:24,333 --> 02:01:25,525
What's the role of our families in this, 
sir?

2241
02:01:25,771 --> 02:01:27,057
Why are you dragging them into this?

2242
02:01:27,257 --> 02:01:29,209
We didn't commit any crime. 
We just brought the girl here.

2243
02:01:29,668 --> 02:01:30,497
We didn't kill her.

2244
02:01:30,697 --> 02:01:33,348
Why don't you believe us when we say 
we didn't even get physical with her?

2245
02:01:33,757 --> 02:01:35,025
So you've hardened atlast.

2246
02:01:35,555 --> 02:01:36,869
Let them come you idiots...

2247
02:01:37,069 --> 02:01:40,268
You'll get to know what big 
mistake and crime you've committed.

2248
02:01:40,528 --> 02:01:42,403
Sir, it's a mistake we brought the lady.

2249
02:01:42,603 --> 02:01:43,866
We didn't commit any crime above that.

2250
02:01:44,072 --> 02:01:45,502
-We just committed a mistake. 
-Yeah.

2251
02:01:45,712 --> 02:01:48,774
What good am I and the courts if 
you decide on crimes and justice?

2252
02:01:48,974 --> 02:01:50,801
Sir, the court needs a witness, 
doesn't it?

2253
02:01:51,072 --> 02:01:52,492
Are you fine if the girl 
gives the witness herself?

2254
02:01:52,692 --> 02:01:53,531
What are you talking?

2255
02:01:53,731 --> 02:01:54,864
[in unison]: Are you fine with it?

2256
02:01:55,976 --> 02:01:56,979
Wait a minute.

2257
02:01:57,437 --> 02:01:58,367
Ms. Sunny Leone.

2258
02:01:59,275 --> 02:02:01,224
Ms. Asha, please come here.

2259
02:02:05,203 --> 02:02:06,229
-Hey, who's this one? 
-Witness.

2260
02:02:06,429 --> 02:02:07,439
The witness you asked for.

2261
02:02:08,207 --> 02:02:10,853
It's me. 
The lady they brought here was me.

2262
02:02:11,974 --> 02:02:15,267
I hope there would be no 
case on them as I'm alive!

2263
02:02:15,802 --> 02:02:18,317
Wouldn't you believe it if I 
tell the same thing in the court?

2264
02:02:18,505 --> 02:02:20,412
Ah... I understand now...

2265
02:02:20,708 --> 02:02:22,093
the reason behind your sudden bravery.

2266
02:02:22,620 --> 02:02:23,640
Anyway...

2267
02:02:24,087 --> 02:02:26,118
You've got your plan and I've got mine.

2268
02:02:26,745 --> 02:02:27,988
-If I kill her... 
-Sir... sir...

2269
02:02:28,188 --> 02:02:28,769
-Sir... 
-Sir... sir...

2270
02:02:28,969 --> 02:02:30,227
-you would get it then... 
-Don't harm her, sir.

2271
02:02:30,427 --> 02:02:31,054
-Please sir. 
-Please dont harm her.

2272
02:02:31,254 --> 02:02:35,165
I remember the three monkeys 
seeing you tremble in fear.

2273
02:02:35,627 --> 02:02:37,035
Three wise monkeys!

2274
02:02:37,565 --> 02:02:39,044
Now even the god can't save you.

2275
02:02:39,244 --> 02:02:40,366
Leave her sir. [mobile message tone]

2276
02:02:43,148 --> 02:02:46,135
If I kill her... you'd get it then.

2277
02:02:46,964 --> 02:02:47,749
What's that?

2278
02:02:47,949 --> 02:02:49,441
Oh! I've already forwarded it to you. 
See it.

2279
02:02:49,641 --> 02:02:50,313
[in unison]: Check it out.

2280
02:02:50,513 --> 02:02:51,339
[mobile message tone]

2281
02:02:52,776 --> 02:02:54,881
You've got your plan and I've got mine.

2282
02:02:55,092 --> 02:02:56,097
If I kill her...

2283
02:02:56,297 --> 02:02:57,981
Hey... who filmed this?

2284
02:02:58,920 --> 02:02:59,785
Huh?

2285
02:03:00,164 --> 02:03:02,286
-Who the hell filmed it? Tell me you! 
-Sir!

2286
02:03:02,486 --> 02:03:03,779
-Tell me! 
-Stop it sir!

2287
02:03:04,331 --> 02:03:06,418
You hold a responsible job of a cop,

2288
02:03:06,713 --> 02:03:08,208
but you've stopped protecting the truth...

2289
02:03:08,417 --> 02:03:11,310
and are trying to turn a lie 
into truth just for money?

2290
02:03:12,181 --> 02:03:14,146
You're blessed with everything. 
Yet you want money.

2291
02:03:14,346 --> 02:03:16,997
You'd go to any lenghts for that money.

2292
02:03:17,361 --> 02:03:18,583
But these guys have got nothing.

2293
02:03:19,079 --> 02:03:21,610
Even when they knew you'd kill 
them if they don't pay you,

2294
02:03:21,810 --> 02:03:25,557
they helped saving the life 
of a girl with that money.

2295
02:03:26,075 --> 02:03:28,163
Help? What help?

2296
02:03:28,427 --> 02:03:30,099
The reason my mother 
died in my childhood...

2297
02:03:30,903 --> 02:03:32,595
wasn't because there was 
no cure for her illness.

2298
02:03:33,605 --> 02:03:34,899
But because we couldn't any help.

2299
02:03:36,809 --> 02:03:38,043
Before she died...

2300
02:03:38,594 --> 02:03:41,090
Charity is done to people who ask.

2301
02:03:42,486 --> 02:03:45,091
But help is given to 
people without asking.

2302
02:03:48,384 --> 02:03:53,949
Your mother is dying today, not because 
there isn't a cure for her disease.

2303
02:03:55,397 --> 02:03:56,965
But because we couldn't any help.

2304
02:04:00,982 --> 02:04:02,124
My mother told me.

2305
02:04:02,324 --> 02:04:04,632
Charity is done to people who ask.

2306
02:04:04,904 --> 02:04:07,560
But help is given to 
people without asking.

2307
02:04:07,848 --> 02:04:09,061
My mother is dead today because 
we couldn't find any help.

2308
02:04:13,081 --> 02:04:14,833
-Who are you? 
-I'm Chinna.

2309
02:04:15,744 --> 02:04:17,790
I'm the son of my mother Lakshmi.

2310
02:04:19,238 --> 02:04:20,860
What was your name in your childhood?

2311
02:04:21,235 --> 02:04:22,558
My name is Santosh, sir.

2312
02:04:22,995 --> 02:04:23,941
Your name in your childhood?

2313
02:04:24,604 --> 02:04:25,383
Chinna.

2314
02:04:25,583 --> 02:04:26,583
Chinna...

2315
02:04:27,393 --> 02:04:31,343
You who helped me don't remember it, 
but I who got your help do.

2316
02:04:32,639 --> 02:04:36,227
Because, 
a person who does charity is remembered.

2317
02:04:36,815 --> 02:04:39,195
But a person who helps is adored by heart.

2318
02:04:40,138 --> 02:04:43,257
The money used for my mother's 
final rights was your help Chinna.

2319
02:04:49,855 --> 02:04:52,146
You still are the same 
person you were that day.

2320
02:04:52,611 --> 02:04:57,720
But it's me that was chasing 
money with hatred on this society.

2321
02:05:00,237 --> 02:05:01,295
How is the girl now Chinna?

2322
02:05:01,495 --> 02:05:03,333
We still need another five lakhs, sir.

2323
02:05:03,533 --> 02:05:05,266
Even if it exceeds five lakhs...

2324
02:05:05,801 --> 02:05:06,835
I'll give it Chinna.

2325
02:05:07,595 --> 02:05:08,629
Thank you so much, sir.

2326
02:05:11,129 --> 02:05:12,893
We thought sir was a crook but he isn't!

2327
02:05:15,200 --> 02:05:15,994
-Bro... 
-Yeah.

2328
02:05:16,194 --> 02:05:17,298
-I have a doubt. 
-Doubt?

2329
02:05:17,498 --> 02:05:18,600
You took the dead body that day.

2330
02:05:18,951 --> 02:05:20,124
But this lady is alove.

2331
02:05:20,560 --> 02:05:22,486
Whose dead body is that and 
how did you come to our place?

2332
02:05:22,686 --> 02:05:25,267
I've been investigating the case 
of a drug peddlar since long.

2333
02:05:25,525 --> 02:05:26,386
[gun fired] As a part of that...

2334
02:05:26,586 --> 02:05:29,114
when I performed a second encounter, 
I found a wallet near the body.

2335
02:05:29,314 --> 02:05:30,176
That had your address.

2336
02:05:30,376 --> 02:05:33,185
When I came to you, you revealed your 
story. You know what happened after that.

2337
02:05:34,801 --> 02:05:36,048
- I have a doubt too. 
-What's that?

2338
02:05:36,248 --> 02:05:37,262
Who recorded the video?

2339
02:05:40,544 --> 02:05:41,389
-[in unison]: Deva. 
-Deva?

2340
02:05:41,589 --> 02:05:42,909
-Our owner Sahadeva. 
-Our owner Sahadeva.

2341
02:05:43,339 --> 02:05:44,172
Oh...

2342
02:05:45,104 --> 02:05:46,092
Come sir, let's go.

2343
02:05:46,292 --> 02:05:47,265
-Okay. 
-Let's go to Lakshmi.

2344
02:06:01,651 --> 02:06:02,731
Success...

2345
02:06:05,919 --> 02:06:10,374
It's important who stands with us 
even when we don't taste success.

2346
02:06:12,532 --> 02:06:14,674
Whomever I share this success with...

2347
02:06:14,874 --> 02:06:18,731
my happiness is in celebrating 
with with all of you.

2348
02:06:20,168 --> 02:06:25,073
No one knows whom we meet where, 
when and why in this world.

2349
02:06:26,473 --> 02:06:27,738
Except god.

2350
02:06:28,720 --> 02:06:32,190
But every acquaintance has a reason.

2351
02:06:34,806 --> 02:06:35,840
Asha ma'am...

2352
02:06:36,882 --> 02:06:39,879
If I have not met you, 
I'd have never come up with this story.

2353
02:06:40,692 --> 02:06:41,943
I'd never had made a film.

2354
02:06:42,369 --> 02:06:46,239
I wouldn't have had such a big 
hit up my sleeve and be so famous.

2355
02:06:47,099 --> 02:06:48,349
Thanks for everything.

2356
02:06:48,956 --> 02:06:50,686
[applause]

2357
02:06:50,985 --> 02:06:53,258
Oh! What great have I done in this!

2358
02:06:54,162 --> 02:06:55,431
Infact I should thank you.

2359
02:06:55,631 --> 02:06:58,490
Because I've become an 
actress because of you.

2360
02:06:59,801 --> 02:07:02,412
My daughter Lakshmi... [sobs]

2361
02:07:02,741 --> 02:07:04,646
is alive because of you.

2362
02:07:04,846 --> 02:07:06,620
Oh, come on...

2363
02:07:07,189 --> 02:07:09,099
would anyone be gloomy 
at such a happy moment?

2364
02:07:09,801 --> 02:07:11,207
If all of this haven't happened...

2365
02:07:11,635 --> 02:07:16,765
Tulasi wouldn't have 
stepped into my filthy life.

2366
02:07:17,650 --> 02:07:20,356
She entered into my 
lonely life with a loan.

2367
02:07:22,057 --> 02:07:23,869
She showered me with so 
much love as my mom did...

2368
02:07:27,224 --> 02:07:28,669
she has become my wife now.

2369
02:07:28,869 --> 02:07:31,477
Look at him! He couldn't utter a 
word when he was into marketing.

2370
02:07:31,677 --> 02:07:32,697
And now he is weaving words!

2371
02:07:34,845 --> 02:07:36,680
By the way, how was your US trip?

2372
02:07:37,022 --> 02:07:38,049
It was awesome.

2373
02:07:38,474 --> 02:07:40,290
I was afraid of doing anything in life...

2374
02:07:40,893 --> 02:07:43,026
You people gave me the courage 
to do anything. That's enough.

2375
02:07:43,226 --> 02:07:44,869
-Good! 
-I forgot to tell you.

2376
02:07:45,241 --> 02:07:48,148
People in US like my performance 
and extended my VISA for two years.

2377
02:07:48,348 --> 02:07:49,399
-Oh! 
-Oh!

2378
02:07:49,599 --> 02:07:50,936
-Congrats! 
-Congrats!

2379
02:07:52,113 --> 02:07:53,948
[phone rings]

2380
02:07:55,735 --> 02:07:56,643
Hello.

2381
02:07:56,743 --> 02:07:58,060
Hello, Phani?

2382
02:07:58,260 --> 02:07:58,894
Who is this?

2383
02:07:59,094 --> 02:08:00,659
