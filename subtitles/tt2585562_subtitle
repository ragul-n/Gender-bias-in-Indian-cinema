1
00:00:13,601 --> 00:00:14,509
The place that we are standing now

2
00:00:14,509 --> 00:00:21,624
Is the same where a big fire accident took place in 1997, killing 17 people, the J.K Polytechnic college

3
00:00:22,264 --> 00:00:24,505
14 years on since the incident took place

4
00:00:24,505 --> 00:00:25,787
The college has always been closed

5
00:00:25,894 --> 00:00:27,465
Nobody ever comes this way

6
00:00:27,512 --> 00:00:32,704
After the fire accident, people around here say that ghosts roam around this college

7
00:00:32,808 --> 00:00:33,898
One Minute

8
00:00:35,404 --> 00:00:37,300
He is Mr.Perumaal

9
00:00:37,626 --> 00:00:40,341
When people here are scared as shit to speak about this college

10
00:00:40,398 --> 00:00:42,906
He remains the only person whose got the guts to talk about it

11
00:00:43,009 --> 00:00:44,351
Yes Mr.Perumall?

12
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:46,578
Dont you believe in ghosts et all?

13
00:00:46,628 --> 00:00:47,461
I believe

14
00:00:47,599 --> 00:00:49,145
I've seen em myself 4-5 times

15
00:00:49,334 --> 00:00:51,446
But i aint scared and all

16
00:00:51,682 --> 00:00:53,735
I was an attender in this very same college

17
00:00:53,826 --> 00:00:54,396
So

18
00:00:54,486 --> 00:00:58,091
It is in this J.K polytechnic college which the whole town seems to scared about that we are going to stay toight

19
00:00:58,206 --> 00:01:07,166
We are going to stay and find out if there is any truth at all to the claims that people in this town have been making

20
00:01:09,621 --> 00:01:11,079
Dude, Careful

21
00:01:12,409 --> 00:01:14,305
This is the classroom

22
00:01:16,103 --> 00:01:18,569
Ya, go up

23
00:01:27,958 --> 00:01:28,971
What is this?

24
00:01:29,632 --> 00:01:31,554
This is only the library

25
00:01:32,687 --> 00:01:35,272
Thousands of books, burnt to ashes

26
00:01:35,272 --> 00:01:37,459
These are the only remaining ones

27
00:01:39,585 --> 00:01:42,486
It is here that 4 students died,their bodies as black as charcoal

28
00:01:47,572 --> 00:01:48,537
What's this?

29
00:01:48,827 --> 00:01:49,953
EM spiter

30
00:01:49,987 --> 00:01:50,759
Meaning?

31
00:01:51,197 --> 00:01:52,280
In short,

32
00:01:52,328 --> 00:01:53,821
Should a ghost come by

33
00:01:53,821 --> 00:01:55,015
This pointer will start moving

34
00:01:56,971 --> 00:01:58,041
Yeah bro

35
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:03,572
should we take a video when this pointer moves, the ghost if at all present, will show up on the video

36
00:02:03,572 --> 00:02:05,849
Hence am keeping it with me at all times

37
00:02:06,777 --> 00:02:08,555
bro, is the pointer moving?

38
00:02:08,674 --> 00:02:09,841
No

39
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:11,646
Ask some of your friends to come?

40
00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:14,266
Dudes come

41
00:02:14,556 --> 00:02:15,606
Small Boys

42
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,774
If you are scared bring few others with you

43
00:02:18,048 --> 00:02:19,673
Guys, stop fooling around

44
00:02:19,735 --> 00:02:21,508
You might do some crap and leave

45
00:02:21,548 --> 00:02:23,172
It will mean our dead bodies in the future

46
00:02:23,527 --> 00:02:26,266
brother, stop whining
ever since you came you've been giving only build-ups

47
00:02:26,406 --> 00:02:28,789
where are the ghosts brother? second saturday leave eh?

48
00:02:28,899 --> 00:02:30,316
Dont play

49
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:31,982
Am leaving

50
00:02:32,106 --> 00:02:33,540
Come, lets all just leave this place

51
00:02:33,595 --> 00:02:35,442
Dude, leave him alone.
If he wants to leave, let him leave

52
00:02:35,511 --> 00:02:36,712
Must have got scared.Like a pussy

53
00:02:36,726 --> 00:02:37,879
Whom are you calling pussy?

54
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:38,765
You only

55
00:02:38,953 --> 00:02:40,072
Having come all the way...

56
00:02:40,072 --> 00:02:43,093
ssh ssh ssh

57
00:02:52,253 --> 00:02:54,091
We are aware that someone has come here?

58
00:02:55,719 --> 00:02:58,416
It is for you that we've been waiting so long

59
00:02:59,979 --> 00:03:02,217
It is only to see you that we've all come here

60
00:03:02,217 --> 00:03:04,717
sir, what sir this guy is talking like he is talking to some neighbour?

61
00:03:04,717 --> 00:03:08,974
Shut the fuck up
You've seen only 4-5. we see 40-50 everyday.

62
00:03:08,974 --> 00:03:10,657
This is our job.Shut up and stay quiet

63
00:03:11,623 --> 00:03:13,034
Are we allowed to stay here?

64
00:03:14,465 --> 00:03:23,218
Or do we leave?
If you want us to leave, tell us, show some signal or come and stand infront of us

65
00:03:23,294 --> 00:03:24,606
otherwise we will....

66
00:03:25,716 --> 00:03:27,516
Dude, you heard something right?

67
00:03:27,592 --> 00:03:28,270
ya dude

68
00:03:38,655 --> 00:03:40,546
Do you think it was the sund of this falling down?

69
00:03:40,732 --> 00:03:41,739
Its not that

70
00:03:41,739 --> 00:03:43,567
There was some other sound here

71
00:03:44,632 --> 00:03:47,233
We cant take these sounds and all as your signal

72
00:03:48,589 --> 00:03:50,330
We expect to be told even more clearly

73
00:03:52,178 --> 00:03:54,480
Otherwise we will stay here only

74
00:03:55,203 --> 00:03:57,391
what was that, what was that?

75
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:01,371
Dude

76
00:04:01,371 --> 00:04:02,264
What?

77
00:04:02,264 --> 00:04:02,990
I saw it now

78
00:04:03,191 --> 00:04:04,357
Isaw it

79
00:04:04,469 --> 00:04:05,720
Where?
to the right of Muthu

80
00:04:05,902 --> 00:04:07,065
It went from left to right

81
00:04:07,277 --> 00:04:12,667
Then it surely must have been recorded on this camera.
yeah it surely must have.
Prem

82
00:04:19,657 --> 00:04:21,007
It has gone through that door only

83
00:04:21,009 --> 00:04:21,951
Guys,we'll leave

84
00:04:24,908 --> 00:04:27,294
Guys, listen to my words please
we dont need all this

85
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,923
Someone is pushing from inside

86
00:04:39,442 --> 00:04:41,348
Look at this

87
00:04:45,059 --> 00:04:47,759
Guys please please listen. Dont do anything

88
00:05:00,301 --> 00:05:01,366
hey

89
00:05:01,621 --> 00:05:02,190
Give it

90
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:07,166
Fool, It got over

91
00:05:10,357 --> 00:05:11,373
Now what?

92
00:05:11,601 --> 00:05:13,377
There must've been a very dangerous ghost in that room right?

93
00:05:14,237 --> 00:05:15,849
I see that everyday no?

94
00:05:15,967 --> 00:05:17,097
Its so Boring

95
00:05:25,247 --> 00:05:26,129
Sadist

96
00:05:26,247 --> 00:05:27,830
you changed it right at the end of the film

97
00:05:29,761 --> 00:05:31,499
The ghost will come out of the TV and get hold of you or what?

98
00:05:31,557 --> 00:05:32,992
Pussy

99
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:36,492
Hey, Does this  look like a house to you?

100
00:05:37,076 --> 00:05:39,315
As if you are studying to be a professional ghost hunter

101
00:05:39,389 --> 00:05:42,773
all around ghost books, ghost Dvds,ghost programs

102
00:05:42,773 --> 00:05:45,504
I sometimes find myself seething with doubts if am in love with the devil itself

103
00:05:49,295 --> 00:05:52,649
I've told you countless number of times i aint doin all these for time pass

104
00:05:52,865 --> 00:05:54,753
They are research for the novel am writing

105
00:05:54,774 --> 00:05:56,148
Keep repeating the same excuse over and over

106
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:58,983
So much for a dumb novel that you are writing..

107
00:05:59,039 --> 00:05:59,699
Hey

108
00:05:59,936 --> 00:06:05,203
Someday my novel is going to get published and grab all the awards thats at stake.Just wait and see

109
00:06:08,934 --> 00:06:10,337
Am seriously asking you

110
00:06:10,414 --> 00:06:12,081
Whatever we watch on TV is true eh?

111
00:06:12,135 --> 00:06:13,205
You think its not?

112
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,135
You think its the truth?

113
00:06:14,295 --> 00:06:16,406
A ghost will come and walk befor your eyes or what?

114
00:06:17,385 --> 00:06:18,295
Its possible

115
00:06:19,192 --> 00:06:21,494
It can.i've seen it myself.

116
00:06:25,317 --> 00:06:26,367
Where?

117
00:06:26,367 --> 00:06:27,460
In my first year,

118
00:06:27,578 --> 00:06:28,706
My hostel mate

119
00:06:28,862 --> 00:06:30,481
There was a girl by the name, Deepa

120
00:06:30,753 --> 00:06:33,767
We were gossiping untill 4 in the morning

121
00:06:33,767 --> 00:06:34,912
Before she left for her room

122
00:06:35,087 --> 00:06:37,300
I went to my room and dozed off

123
00:06:37,418 --> 00:06:41,529
When we got up in the morning, shw wasnt alive.

124
00:06:42,349 --> 00:06:43,677
suicide

125
00:06:45,995 --> 00:06:47,529
Have you ever seen someone hanging by the neck?

126
00:06:47,529 --> 00:06:48,696
No

127
00:06:49,078 --> 00:06:51,993
The tongue will be hanging out till here

128
00:06:53,378 --> 00:06:55,844
After that i couldnt sleep at night

129
00:06:56,296 --> 00:06:57,604
all of a sudden i'd hear her voices

130
00:06:57,983 --> 00:06:59,580
Like she's close by me

131
00:06:59,822 --> 00:07:01,200
Like she's touching me

132
00:07:01,329 --> 00:07:03,794
i'd feel like someone was always there in my room

133
00:07:04,037 --> 00:07:05,887
one day night i woke up all of a sudden

134
00:07:06,582 --> 00:07:07,578
To see her

135
00:07:07,722 --> 00:07:08,633
on my bed

136
00:07:08,701 --> 00:07:10,126
near my legs

137
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:11,754
Her! It was Her

138
00:07:11,841 --> 00:07:13,951
She was right there and looking at me

139
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:15,547
She was telling me something

140
00:07:15,736 --> 00:07:17,058
I quickly turned on the lights

141
00:07:17,189 --> 00:07:18,584
to find no one in the room

142
00:07:18,682 --> 00:07:19,356
hey

143
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:21,382
You aint getting scared are you?

144
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:22,924
No no. go on

145
00:07:23,348 --> 00:07:25,874
The college itself was talking about that only for a few days

146
00:07:26,147 --> 00:07:29,059
After that, i was not able to stay at that hostel at all

147
00:07:29,118 --> 00:07:30,619
Changing different rooms

148
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:32,471
And here i am in this house, 2 years from then

149
00:07:32,549 --> 00:07:34,401
without any problems

150
00:07:38,536 --> 00:07:40,004
have you seen her after that?

151
00:07:40,078 --> 00:07:40,992
mmm

152
00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:43,743
i've seen her

153
00:07:43,795 --> 00:07:44,373
but

154
00:07:44,415 --> 00:07:45,352
i got used to it

155
00:07:45,775 --> 00:07:48,331
the creepiness disappeared paving the way for interest

156
00:07:48,712 --> 00:07:50,727
i once even tried talking to her

157
00:07:51,051 --> 00:07:51,787
But

158
00:07:51,885 --> 00:07:53,315
She didnt talk back

159
00:07:54,816 --> 00:07:55,441
why?

160
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,173
Even now she could be in this very room

161
00:08:00,162 --> 00:08:03,808
She could be sitting closeby and listening in to whatever we are talking

162
00:08:25,756 --> 00:08:29,556
actually if something like this happens to someone close to us,
thoughts such as these would often come and go

163
00:08:29,596 --> 00:08:30,408
you are using them and exagger

164
00:08:30,408 --> 00:08:31,526
These are not mere thoughts

165
00:08:31,526 --> 00:08:32,817
They do exist

166
00:08:32,894 --> 00:08:36,942
Did you know that in chennai alone there are 100-200 people commiting suicide every year?

167
00:08:36,962 --> 00:08:38,559
How many of them are dying in accidents?

168
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:39,623
What became of them?

169
00:08:39,657 --> 00:08:44,254
Even recently they showed in idhayam program about a building in chennai where ghosts are apparently on the loose

170
00:08:44,254 --> 00:08:44,921
saw that?

171
00:08:47,714 --> 00:08:53,631
Two years back the death of two policemen at the entrance of the same house remains a mystery till date

172
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:56,693
Where is that building by the way?

173
00:08:56,715 --> 00:08:57,148
why?

174
00:08:57,756 --> 00:08:59,701
to feel freaked out everytime you pass by that side eh?

175
00:09:00,966 --> 00:09:03,153
Like you've told me very less now

176
00:09:04,382 --> 00:09:06,015
you're so freaked out just hearing about it

177
00:09:06,015 --> 00:09:07,757
what will you do should you witness it?

178
00:09:08,292 --> 00:09:10,392
Stuff like these, rather than witnessing it for real

179
00:09:10,392 --> 00:09:13,896
it is even more scary when people like you have to narrate it

180
00:09:21,317 --> 00:09:25,635
Honestly, these devils, ghosts exist eh?

181
00:09:25,818 --> 00:09:27,268
For everyone, there will come a moment in life

182
00:09:27,574 --> 00:09:30,295
a moment that makes the unbelievable, believable

183
00:09:30,531 --> 00:09:33,782
if something like that happens to you, you will also believe

184
00:09:34,571 --> 00:09:35,228

00:12:53,406 --> 00:12:55,195
if you get to know them

249
00:12:55,591 --> 00:12:57,280

You are very careless when it comes to certain things Anu

269
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:36,763
thats why i scolded

270
00:14:38,157 --> 00:14:39,527

271
00:14:40,775 --> 00:14:42,140
it is for your own good that i shouted at you no?

272
00:14:47,003 --> 00:14:48,805

285
00:15:40,047 --> 00:15:41,130
Shall we abort it?

286
00:15:42,963 --> 00:15:44,197

287
00:15:45,507 --> 00:15:46,411

292
00:15:53,007 --> 00:15:55,149
the salary that i get, it aint enough for our expenses itself

293
00:15:55,937 --> 00:15:57,305
now a baby also

294
00:15:57,879 --> 00:15:59,999
already we've bribed the watch-man to manage in this out-house

295
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:03,575
whose there to support us?

296
00:16:04,737 --> 00:16:06,194
Murder you call it?

297
00:16:07,605 --> 00:16:09,118

298
00:16:09,612 --> 00:16:10,931

299
00:16:11,043 --> 00:16:11,918

307
00:16:31,059 --> 00:16:31,492

321
00:18:03,858 --> 00:18:04,385

Laughing forever like a mad-ass

335
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:27,123
Why is this 'Father' sir looking so serious now?

336
00:19:27,226 --> 00:19:29,250
if this had been my place, they'd have beat him black and blue

337
00:19:29,391 --> 00:19:31,133
and they themselves would've bought him new clothes

338
00:19:31,133 --> 00:19:32,746
and conducted the marriage

339
00:19:33,376 --> 00:19:34,876
he'll drive an aeroplane it seems

340
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:37,310
but hesitate to get the license driving an 8

341
00:19:38,263 --> 00:19:39,076
what brother?

342
00:19:39,694 --> 00:19:41,160
you are talking as if i raped someone?

343
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:42,070
Boss

344
00:19:42,444 --> 00:19:43,994
we've both been in love since our schooldays

345
00:19:44,921 --> 00:19:46,535
any day, it is she who will be my wife

346
00:19:47,879 --> 00:19:48,413
what?

347
00:19:48,747 --> 00:19:51,090
how brother with this salary? marriage? children?

348
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:52,904
How do i manage brother?

349
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:57,746
you say that the two of you lived all along together in the same room

350
00:19:58,330 --> 00:19:59,742
Had something like this happened before?

351
00:20:00,171 --> 00:20:01,740
all this is god's gift dude

352
00:20:04,367 --> 00:20:05,028
Hello boss?

353
00:20:05,068 --> 00:20:05,450
what?

354
00:20:06,749 --> 00:20:07,660
dont annoy

355
00:20:08,215 --> 00:20:08,874
whats up with him?

356
00:20:08,995 --> 00:20:11,182
So, that and all is a sin

357
00:20:11,536 --> 00:20:12,597
You should not do abortion

358
00:20:12,597 --> 00:20:13,730
you should not at all

359
00:20:13,828 --> 00:20:14,801
What do you say to this?

360
00:20:15,106 --> 00:20:15,699
Is that so?

361
00:20:15,773 --> 00:20:16,378
what?

362
00:20:16,404 --> 00:20:18,151
Shall we put a case on the company?

363
00:20:35,227 --> 00:20:36,301
michael

364
00:20:36,945 --> 00:20:40,326
You are saying that, no matter what, it is that girl that you are going to marry

365
00:20:40,512 --> 00:20:45,266
Most of the people today who come asking for divorce,come only in costly cars

366
00:20:45,903 --> 00:20:48,500
So rather than fretting yourself over money,

367
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:51,059
shut and go get yourself married

368
00:20:51,322 --> 00:20:52,337
What am saying is correct only no?

369
00:20:52,337 --> 00:20:53,638
yeah
marry her

370
00:20:54,203 --> 00:20:57,093
After that buy the two of us the costliest beers from Tasmarc for 150 bucks

371
00:20:57,218 --> 00:20:57,995
And give us treat

372
00:20:58,463 --> 00:20:59,560

00:30:17,998 --> 00:30:19,277
if you expect something radical,

443
00:30:19,277 --> 00:30:21,024
am quite ready to stoop to those levels

444
00:30:21,185 --> 00:30:22,998
Dont delay any longer and send it as soon as possible

445
00:30:29,593 --> 00:30:30,379

00:30:39,784 --> 00:30:40,833
This christmas

454
00:30:40,833 --> 00:30:41,904

459
00:30:50,146 --> 00:30:51,583
rather than inviting everyone, spending

460
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,397
Fighting over the taste of the dishes offered

461
00:30:54,572 --> 00:30:55,347

are you angry over someone?

515
00:33:24,604 --> 00:33:26,488

517
00:33:49,417 --> 00:33:50,612

ok sir

529
00:34:14,992 --> 00:34:16,113
the guy was asking her

530
00:34:16,773 --> 00:34:18,122
if she wanted to see someone

531
00:34:18,787 --> 00:34:20,176
if she was angry over someone

532
00:34:20,285 --> 00:34:22,052
if she seeked revenge

533
00:34:23,774 --> 00:34:25,240
She turns her head then

534
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:26,272
And looks at me

535
00:34:26,272 --> 00:34:27,036
In a very weird way

536
00:34:27,731 --> 00:34:28,604
an angry look

537
00:34:28,898 --> 00:34:30,377
that very instant, i started shivering

538
00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:32,714
didnt i say the other day itself?

539
00:34:33,696 --> 00:34:34,881
your moment came, see?

540
00:34:50,322 --> 00:34:53,103
you can guess the presence of ghosts with certain signals

541
00:34:53,103 --> 00:34:54,002
How?

542
00:34:54,038 --> 00:34:57,581
Somewher in the distance, a dog will...

543
00:35:11,009 --> 00:35:12,773
buffalo, buffalo

544
00:35:12,773 --> 00:35:14,450
i'd have died you fool

545
00:35:28,092 --> 00:35:29,670
i've known priya from when she was young

546
00:35:29,773 --> 00:35:30,998
A very good girl

547
00:35:30,998 --> 00:35:32,852
only in the last 2 years that its become like this

548
00:35:32,915 --> 00:35:34,708
She'd been to some friend's place

549
00:35:34,728 --> 00:35:35,835
and had returned by night

550
00:35:35,838 --> 00:35:37,478
and started screaming all of a sudden

551
00:35:37,624 --> 00:35:40,593
ever since, she's been suffering like this

552
00:35:40,623 --> 00:35:44,401
ever since there's not a temple or priest or sorcerer that shanmugam has spared

553
00:35:58,348 --> 00:35:59,786
one night around 1.30

554
00:36:00,022 --> 00:36:01,402
i was smoking on the terrace

555
00:36:02,286 --> 00:36:03,535
there was a railway track behind

556
00:36:04,134 --> 00:36:05,442
in the distance i saw a woman standing

557
00:36:06,301 --> 00:36:08,698
how fast do you think a woman can walk on a railway track?

558
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:10,570
There will be stones all right?

559
00:36:10,908 --> 00:36:11,930
i kept watching

560
00:36:11,930 --> 00:36:13,488
She went like a flash from that end to this end

561
00:36:47,352 --> 00:36:47,937
Brother

562
00:36:47,937 --> 00:36:48,464

01:36:00,239 --> 01:36:02,232
that has been locked since

1135
01:36:02,429 --> 01:36:04,404
those people near the house

1136
01:36:04,443 --> 01:36:07,002
they believe that there are ghosts in there

1137
01:36:07,174 --> 01:36:08,472
even two years back

1138
01:36:08,472 --> 01:36:11,151
2 policemen were found dead there

1139
01:36:11,259 --> 01:36:13,348
till date no one knows how they died

1140
01:36:13,954 --> 01:36:17,269
the case is still open in the police department

1141
01:36:17,594 --> 01:36:19,111
these are the details of the house

1142
01:36:22,197 --> 01:36:24,385
this, small girl,who died

1143
01:36:25,072 --> 01:36:26,240
her name's nithya eh?

1144
01:36:28,300 --> 01:36:30,488
the lady's name was smitha

1145
01:36:31,614 --> 01:36:33,073
kid's name?

1146
01:36:34,205 --> 01:36:35,536
i'll ask them to enquire

1147
01:36:44,622 --> 01:36:46,099
the other day doctor prescribed right?

1148
01:36:46,099 --> 01:36:46,989
inhaler

1149
01:36:46,989 --> 01:36:49,667
use it when you have difficulty breathing

1150
01:36:49,902 --> 01:36:50,811
you know how to use it right?

1151
01:36:50,811 --> 01:36:51,302
i know

1152
01:36:54,954 --> 01:36:56,492
ok i'll have bath and come

1153
01:36:57,872 --> 01:37:00,254
the watchman of this house was a total drunkard sir

1154
01:37:00,464 --> 01:37:03,113
he only rented out the outhouse to them

1155
01:37:03,250 --> 01:37:06,168
Micheal brother only used to come and go often

1156
01:37:07,231 --> 01:37:08,690
the girl..

1157
01:37:08,947 --> 01:37:09,908
i've hardly seen her

1158
01:37:09,928 --> 01:37:12,845
both of them grew up in an orphanage in madurai

1159
01:37:13,360 --> 01:37:14,580
when i asked him,

1160
01:37:14,580 --> 01:37:16,882
he said they left the ashram 5 years back

1161
01:37:16,882 --> 01:37:19,322
it seems nobody in the ashram knew about the marriage either

1162
01:37:19,322 --> 01:37:20,567
i enquired in the college

1163
01:37:21,277 --> 01:37:24,076
it seems she came 2 months back to get her arrears application

1164
01:37:24,307 --> 01:37:27,052
after that there's been no contact from her side

1165
01:37:27,581 --> 01:37:29,177
nothing's clear here

1166
01:37:29,311 --> 01:37:31,078
if we dont any clues

1167
01:37:31,078 --> 01:37:32,915
the way we enquire itself will be radically different

1168
01:37:33,395 --> 01:37:35,364
what if he himself had killed and buried her?

1169
01:37:36,569 --> 01:37:37,709
he's not that kind of a person sir

1170
01:37:38,477 --> 01:37:42,153
huh? there are people who even kill infants!

1171
01:37:45,690 --> 01:37:46,744
anu wouldnt have gone anywhere

1172
01:37:46,744 --> 01:37:48,170
we'll sure find her

1173
01:37:50,018 --> 01:37:51,825
you first get out of that room, outside

1174
01:37:52,126 --> 01:37:54,447
stupid thoughts'll come to you should you keep to yourself

1175
01:37:54,611 --> 01:37:55,190
First

1176
01:37:55,300 --> 01:37:56,101
you've to come for work

1177
01:37:56,349 --> 01:37:57,877
then only you will have some sort of diversion

1178
01:38:02,988 --> 01:38:04,885
brother? brother..

1179
01:38:05,744 --> 01:38:06,668
what?

1180
01:38:06,855 --> 01:38:07,569
inside

1181
01:38:08,418 --> 01:38:09,802
something black

1182
01:38:09,809 --> 01:38:10,976
some figure

1183
01:38:11,543 --> 01:38:12,510
what are you talking about?

1184
01:38:12,510 --> 01:38:13,263
inside

1185
01:38:24,143 --> 01:38:25,345
no one's in here

1186
01:38:27,970 --> 01:38:28,500
go

1187
01:38:31,013 --> 01:38:32,180
go

1188
01:38:34,687 --> 01:38:35,646
the other day

1189
01:38:35,646 --> 01:38:36,895
i went for this kottiyokam delivery remember?

1190
01:38:36,895 --> 01:38:38,071
around 10.30

1191
01:38:39,187 --> 01:38:39,781
then

1192
01:38:39,961 --> 01:38:42,149
there was some sudden breeze

1193
01:38:42,931 --> 01:38:44,283
like something went inside me

1194
01:38:45,263 --> 01:38:46,520
some sort of bad smell

1195
01:38:47,062 --> 01:38:47,575
i...

1196
01:38:47,575 --> 01:38:48,668
just freaked out

1197
01:38:48,903 --> 01:38:49,869
can you please

1198
01:38:49,869 --> 01:38:51,640
send pandi out on late nights?

1199
01:39:15,466 --> 01:39:16,791
you're okay right?

1200
01:39:22,883 --> 01:39:23,648
brother?

1201
01:39:23,648 --> 01:39:25,837
see if there's any bleeding here?

1202
01:39:27,552 --> 01:39:28,776
there's nothing there

1203
01:39:29,457 --> 01:39:30,916
this side?

1204
01:39:36,177 --> 01:39:37,726
seriously there's nothing

1205
01:39:38,339 --> 01:39:39,502
nothing ah?

1206
01:39:43,172 --> 01:39:44,599
all of a sudden he freaks out

1207
01:39:44,727 --> 01:39:46,277
He cries thinking about the girl

1208
01:39:46,443 --> 01:39:48,753
he's asking to check if there's blood in his back and all

1209
01:39:50,032 --> 01:39:52,782
its so hard for me to see him suffering in the room uncle

1210
01:39:57,579 --> 01:39:58,271
that..

1211
01:39:58,271 --> 01:39:59,708
any news on the girl?

1212
01:40:00,816 --> 01:40:01,815
but

1213
01:40:02,340 --> 01:40:04,529
when we were packing at his place,

1214
01:40:04,628 --> 01:40:06,974
there was no trace of a girl having lived there

1215
01:40:07,092 --> 01:40:07,800
what?

1216
01:40:09,459 --> 01:40:10,626
yeah

1217
01:40:11,939 --> 01:40:13,010
how much longer?

1218
01:40:13,010 --> 01:40:14,696
do you want us to clear the body or not?

1219
01:40:14,696 --> 01:40:15,446
Dont come nearby

1220
01:40:15,446 --> 01:40:16,582
Move, move, move

1221
01:40:22,249 --> 01:40:23,416
what?

1222
01:40:24,245 --> 01:40:24,808
know her?

1223
01:40:24,808 --> 01:40:25,610
no sir

1224
01:40:25,610 --> 01:40:26,777
ok ok clear the place

1225
01:40:27,596 --> 01:40:29,275
all of you leave the place, leave leave

1226
01:40:32,617 --> 01:40:33,559
dont cry

1227
01:40:34,149 --> 01:40:35,316
its not her right?

1228
01:40:41,734 --> 01:40:46,110
you've intentionally or unintentionally done something bad to the kid, nithya

1229
01:40:46,653 --> 01:40:48,142
her spirit only

1230
01:40:48,142 --> 01:40:52,404
is seeking a blood-thirsty revenge over you

1231
01:40:53,630 --> 01:40:54,898
whatever happened till date

1232
01:40:54,898 --> 01:40:56,103
whatever's happening now

1233
01:40:56,103 --> 01:40:58,292
its all her actions,her game

1234
01:40:58,505 --> 01:41:01,636
she is trying to make you, come to her place,with her game

1235
01:41:02,104 --> 01:41:03,464
with god's grace

1236
01:41:03,722 --> 01:41:05,191
we should put this ghost down in the right way

1237
01:41:05,904 --> 01:41:08,821
or bad events such as these wont stop occuring

1238
01:41:09,823 --> 01:41:10,581
Not just that

1239
01:41:10,757 --> 01:41:12,507
even murder might take place

1240
01:41:12,715 --> 01:41:13,939
if you agreed to it

1241
01:41:14,173 --> 01:41:16,252
there's a malayalee sorceror i know

1242
01:41:16,510 --> 01:41:18,429
he's a specialist in controlling ghosts

1243
01:41:18,948 --> 01:41:20,136
we'll invite him and

1244
01:41:20,136 --> 01:41:21,924
do a pooja this full moon

1245
01:41:23,255 --> 01:41:25,019
the order came from thist area only

1246
01:41:25,220 --> 01:41:26,853
but he never went to the house from which the order came

1247
01:41:27,131 --> 01:41:29,325
like he said, his bike was outside this house only

1248
01:41:29,607 --> 01:41:30,503
so, like he says,

1249
01:41:30,503 --> 01:41:31,719
the bag must be in here only

1250
01:41:32,039 --> 01:41:33,502
shall we go inside and just take it?

1251
01:41:40,888 --> 01:41:41,728
it feels creepy only

1252
01:41:41,728 --> 01:41:42,195
but what do we do now?

1253
01:41:43,134 --> 01:41:44,894
it already has killed 2

1254
01:41:45,816 --> 01:41:46,959
dont be hasty

1255
01:41:48,636 --> 01:41:49,916
if its there,it'll be inside only right?

1256
01:41:51,291 --> 01:41:53,479
the sorcerer's coming from kerala

1257
01:41:54,007 --> 01:41:55,349
we'll do a pooja at full moon

1258
01:41:56,321 --> 01:41:57,332
and go inside with their help

1259
01:42:07,777 --> 01:42:09,435
he's not troubled by ghosts all

1260
01:42:09,893 --> 01:42:11,230
but it aint looking like he's lying either

1261
01:42:12,033 --> 01:42:13,200
but

1262
01:42:13,846 --> 01:42:15,067
he's seen something

1263
01:42:15,312 --> 01:42:16,866
and has become terribly scared

1264
01:42:17,181 --> 01:42:19,507
he keeps talking about a girl, anu

1265
01:42:20,412 --> 01:42:21,964
if that girl is not found,

1266
01:42:22,479 --> 01:42:24,548
it is very hard to get him back to normalcy

1267
01:42:26,258 --> 01:42:27,537
the girl,anu

1268
01:42:27,819 --> 01:42:28,926
does she really exist?

1269
01:42:31,478 --> 01:42:32,851
have any of you seen her?

1270
01:42:33,764 --> 01:42:34,575
why sir?

1271
01:42:36,015 --> 01:42:37,787
it is possible that the girl's an imagination

1272
01:42:39,618 --> 01:42:41,036
could be a ghost also

1273
01:42:55,863 --> 01:42:56,723
brother?

1274
01:43:17,263 --> 01:43:18,174
sit down

1275
01:43:20,814 --> 01:43:21,915
how are you?

1276
01:43:22,383 --> 01:43:23,287

1277
01:43:23,871 --> 01:43:25,062

1278
01:43:25,851 --> 01:43:26,607

1279
01:43:27,880 --> 01:43:30,555

1280
01:43:30,825 --> 01:43:31,633

1281
01:43:31,985 --> 01:43:33,889
but i dont go anywhere after 8 sir

1282
01:43:35,174 --> 01:43:37,065
the other day when i was walking down the road

1283
01:43:37,155 --> 01:43:39,033
there was a sort of breeze

1284
01:43:39,587 --> 01:43:41,775
like something got into me

1285
01:43:42,268 --> 01:43:43,895
some weird smell

1286
01:43:44,009 --> 01:43:44,717
here

1287
01:43:49,727 --> 01:43:51,186

pray to the amman and sleep

01:43:57,667 --> 01:43:58,985

1293
01:44:06,295 --> 01:44:07,514

nothing would've happened to anu

1295
01:44:11,350 --> 01:44:12,828

1296
01:44:13,059 --> 01:44:15,977
Troubling you so much at such a young age

1297
01:44:18,163 --> 01:44:19,622
dont cry

1298
01:44:20,380 --> 01:44:21,509
nothing will happen

1299
01:44:21,846 --> 01:44:23,075
god will save us

i've been waiting for one week for your call

1308
01:45:54,984 --> 01:45:56,318

1309
01:45:56,377 --> 01:45:56,853

01:45:56,853 --> 01:45:57,998

1311
01:45:58,135 --> 01:45:59,127

01:45:59,294 --> 01:46:00,878

1340
01:47:45,714 --> 01:47:46,960

1342
01:47:48,090 --> 01:47:48,713

1346
01:47:51,028 --> 01:47:52,299
go see if anything happened to the pizza

1347
01:47:52,383 --> 01:47:53,825
also, if possible, heat it a little

1348
01:48:00,883 --> 01:48:01,856
hey, fast

1349
01:48:03,125 --> 01:48:04,176

1350
01:48:04,675 --> 01:48:06,275
if i dont deliver it within 15 mins

1351
01:48:06,449 --> 01:48:07,969
it will show on my salary

1352
01:48:37,837 --> 01:48:39,400
it is worth a minimum of 2 crores

1353
01:48:42,437 --> 01:48:43,602
shall we take it and run away?

1354
01:48:45,834 --> 01:48:46,848
quit joking

1355
01:48:47,113 --> 01:48:47,890

1356
01:48:48,509 --> 01:48:50,459

1357
01:48:50,813 --> 01:48:52,221

1358
01:48:52,488 --> 01:48:53,927

1359
01:48:53,927 --> 01:48:55,262
search a job

1360
01:48:56,051 --> 01:48:57,038
think a little

1361
01:48:57,178 --> 01:48:59,786
we'll be able to settle in UK/US in 1 month

1362
01:49:00,194 --> 01:49:01,741
you're serious eh?

1363
01:49:03,485 --> 01:49:07,132
if you dont deliver the pizzzas within 30 mins, you dont collect money na?

1364
01:49:07,337 --> 01:49:07,921
why?

1365
01:49:08,237 --> 01:49:10,450
anything that you dont get on time is a waste only

1366
01:49:10,564 --> 01:49:13,290
whats the point in being a rich man at 50?

1367
01:49:13,343 --> 01:49:18,671
we've spent almost half our lives wearing donated clothes and donated food, from the ashram

1368
01:49:18,696 --> 01:49:20,292
it is now that we are going to enjoy life

1369
01:49:20,990 --> 01:49:23,979
even if not for our sake, let it be for the sake of our child

1370
01:49:26,325 --> 01:49:27,852
But sir is a very good man

1371
01:49:28,055 --> 01:49:29,116
we too are michael

1372
01:49:44,719 --> 01:49:45,698
but how?

1373
01:49:46,414 --> 01:49:47,358
with this money

1374
01:49:47,358 --> 01:49:48,124
within 10 days

1375
01:49:48,124 --> 01:49:51,172
we will be able to get fake passports, visas and degree certificates

1376
01:49:52,048 --> 01:49:54,193
we will be at some other place untill we board the flight

1377
01:49:55,180 --> 01:49:56,323
where shall we go?

1378
01:49:58,692 --> 01:50:00,253
we'll go to banglore

1379
01:50:00,484 --> 01:50:02,193
there will be a bus now

1380
01:50:02,624 --> 01:50:04,199
first we'll leave this place

1381
01:50:04,731 --> 01:50:07,251
within few minutes they will start searching for the missing you

1382
01:50:34,169 --> 01:50:36,039
but we need not leave together

1383
01:50:36,039 --> 01:50:37,567
doubts will be cast

1384
01:50:38,347 --> 01:50:39,930
untill now, none of them have seen you

1385
01:50:40,266 --> 01:50:42,493
so you pack your things and leave first

1386
01:50:42,808 --> 01:50:44,088
me........

1387
01:50:44,698 --> 01:50:46,201
i cant leave the bike like this and come

1388
01:50:46,760 --> 01:50:47,979
after doing something to cover that

1389
01:50:48,381 --> 01:50:49,548
i will board a bus tonight

1390
01:50:49,587 --> 01:50:51,873
we'll meet tomorrow morning in banglore

1391
01:50:52,937 --> 01:50:54,429
what if you get caught before boarding the bus?

1392
01:50:55,227 --> 01:50:56,395
if i get caught?

1393
01:51:00,852 --> 01:51:03,118
they'll ask me where i wnet for so long

1394
01:51:05,854 --> 01:51:07,603
they'll ask where's that box right?

1395
01:51:10,316 --> 01:51:11,984
but i dont know that these are inside the box right?

1396
01:51:12,284 --> 01:51:14,335
they'll ask you what happened to the bike and bag

1397
01:51:14,423 --> 01:51:15,115
what do we tell?

1398
01:51:17,331 --> 01:51:18,142
what shall we tell?

1399
01:51:22,633 --> 01:51:23,402
Accident?

1400
01:51:24,550 --> 01:51:26,958
an accident everything but the vehicle is in proper shape eh?

1401
01:51:27,500 --> 01:51:29,230
what if you say someone stole it?

1402
01:51:31,960 --> 01:51:33,220
a police complaint will be made

1403
01:51:33,635 --> 01:51:34,485
we'll get caught

1404
01:51:37,133 --> 01:51:39,546
we should be able to sell a story that they'll believe

1405
01:51:46,940 --> 01:51:47,886
a ghost story?

1406
01:51:53,136 --> 01:51:55,090
everyone have their own weaknesses

1407
01:51:55,693 --> 01:51:56,731
for some, money

1408
01:51:57,048 --> 01:51:58,278
for some, god

1409
01:51:58,636 --> 01:51:59,915
for some, girls

1410
01:52:00,380 --> 01:52:01,377
for your boss?

1411
01:52:05,027 --> 01:52:05,625
spirits

1412
01:52:05,851 --> 01:52:06,570
ghosts

1413
01:52:06,643 --> 01:52:07,485
devils

1414
01:52:18,147 --> 01:52:19,781
you've read my novel right?

1415
01:52:19,981 --> 01:52:21,371
in that , your boss

1416
01:52:21,371 --> 01:52:22,532
his daughter

1417
01:52:22,719 --> 01:52:24,178
some bungalow

1418
01:52:24,899 --> 01:52:26,979
incorporate all these and tell him a believable story

1419
01:52:27,086 --> 01:52:29,986
the other day they were talking in a TV program about some haunted house right?

1420
01:52:30,129 --> 01:52:31,178
smitha bungalow

1421
01:52:31,207 --> 01:52:32,712
what name did priya say that day?

1422
01:52:37,097 --> 01:52:40,288
two constables were also found dead in the bungalow

1423
01:52:40,585 --> 01:52:41,609
enough ah?

1424
01:52:41,609 --> 01:52:43,654
we can use all this and make a ghost film itself

1425
01:52:44,491 --> 01:52:45,411
that is all fine

1426
01:52:45,411 --> 01:52:46,900
what if they ask me where my wife is?

1427
01:52:47,673 --> 01:52:49,686
tell something and manage

1428
01:52:49,722 --> 01:52:51,014
first, we'll leave this place

1429
01:52:53,334 --> 01:52:54,302
stay safe

1430
01:52:54,620 --> 01:52:55,787
when there's no one around,

1431
01:52:55,934 --> 01:52:57,427
leave the bike infront of the house

1432
01:52:57,524 --> 01:52:58,205
board a bus

1433
01:52:58,324 --> 01:52:59,537
call me on my vodafone number

1434
01:53:00,731 --> 01:53:01,905
they've already started doubting

1435
01:53:01,905 --> 01:53:03,095
you first leave the place

1436
01:53:05,971 --> 01:53:08,344
hey, everything will be fine right?

1437
01:53:08,644 --> 01:53:10,541
it must, it should

1438
01:53:10,964 --> 01:53:11,580

1439
01:53:17,295 --> 01:53:18,231

1440
01:53:28,098 --> 01:53:29,275
hey, have you boarded the bus?

1441
01:53:30,008 --> 01:53:31,962

1442
01:53:32,113 --> 01:53:34,179

1443
01:53:34,252 --> 01:53:35,128

in the house?

1458
01:54:22,578 --> 01:54:24,474
he's struggling to speak

1459
01:54:25,064 --> 01:54:27,068

1464

if it was we'd have got the news by now

1465
01:55:08,809 --> 01:55:09,833

if she's also not there

1471
01:55:17,634 --> 01:55:18,988
it means things are heading in the wrong direction.

1472
01:55:18,988 --> 01:55:19,868
we'll go to the cops

1473
01:55:20,085 --> 01:55:21,991

it may take 2 months

1500
01:57:58,160 --> 01:58:00,086
