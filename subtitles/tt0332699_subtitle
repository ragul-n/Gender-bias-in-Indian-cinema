1
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,356
Hurry up and get out

2
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,394
Quick, quick

3
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:57,834
Come on, all of you, hurry up now.

4
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,952
You've packed the car with your
family and you pay me only this?

5
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,109
Bastard.

6
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:39,029
Babu, it's matinee time.

7
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,358
Gufo...

8
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,229
Gufo...

9
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,595
- We'll dump it far away, OK?
- Yes, we'll leave it in the jungle.

10
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,078
Hey, Lati! Where are you going?

11
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,236
We're taking the cat
to get married

12
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,478
- I want to go too
- No.

13
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,796
Ranjani, your girl is growing up.

14
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:07,908
The clients won't want to come
to us any more!

15
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:12,310
There've been many offers to take
her as a mistress.

16
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:17,312
But Rajani doesn't like any
of them. She's waiting for

17
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:22,749
Prince charming to
come on his white charger!

18
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:35,071
There is some good news, sir.
The mother's in the business.

19
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,316
The girl's not in it yet.

20
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:42,878
Her mother is looking for a patron
for the girl

21
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:52,272
She looks like an angel.
She's only about fourteen.

22
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,191
healthy and in good shape.
A spirited girl.

23
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:04,240
She had a scholarship at school.
She's a virgin, just as you want.

24
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,072
If you'd like to go
and have a chat...

25
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,790
Sure, I'll go, but has Ganesh
come back with the car?

26
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:15,995
No.

27
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:18,990
Then?

28
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:23,150
Let the bastard go to hell!

29
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:27,032
You get ready.
When Ganesh comes, I'll call you.

30
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:22,308
You'll start with a kick, won't you?
You bastard!

31
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:32,149
- How much further is it to Gosaipara?
- At the station you said Shimultala

32
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:36,232
No. I'm going to Gosaipara.

33
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:05,833
You can get out here. The car
doesn't go into Gosaipara.

34
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,155
Why?

35
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,037
The road's bad
and the place is worse.

36
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,754
- Who's going to pay the rest?
- l have no more.

37
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,758
What do you mean, you have no more?

38
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,836
See for yourself.
I'm not telling lies.

39
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,110
I don't care about that,
but if you don't pay the fare.

40
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,475
Really, I don't have any more.

41
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:02,033
I'm not lying, believe me.

42
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:06,836
Then give me whatever you've got.
Oh, these whores.

43
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,759
You can have my body.
That's all I've got.

44
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,311
Get lost!

45
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,872
Where is Gosaipara?

46
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,148
What do you want there?

47
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,229
Do you know anyone there?

48
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:31,313
Jamuna Aunty.

49
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,352
I know her.

50
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,759
You know her?

51
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,189
I do. 
 work for her!

52
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,837
- Where are you coming from now?
- From town.

53
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,278
I had a client.
Good money for two nights.

54
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,190
- My name's Bakul.
- What's yours?

55
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:10,189
- Basanti. Are you new to this line?
- Yes.

56
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,155
- lsn't anyone with you?
- No.

57
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,236
What happened?

58
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,872
Maybe you were married, and then
he brought another into the house?

59
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,713
How did you know?

60
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,111
I've been in the trade for eight years.
Why wouldn't I know?

61
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,276
Basanti!

62
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,799
Ayesha!

63
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,876
How good it is to see you!

64
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:46,871
Who is that?

65
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:52,195
Bakul. She's new to the trade.
Lets go.

66
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,669
So you've come back?

67
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:12,758
It seems like a homecoming!
All was lost in the last year's flood.

68
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:18,478
Father told me to go back,
so I left!

69
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,035
If they want to benefit from
this body, then let them.

70
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,474
You had a man, didn't you?
What happened to him?

71
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:33,154
I saw him watching with such joy
when his wife suckled their baby.

72
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:41,352
Mind, body... all men really care
about is their dangling few inches

73
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,758
They have to be taken to hospital
or they'll die.

74
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:03,557
What?

75
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,119
We've been waiting since morning.

76
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,708
Yours is the first vehicle to come
along. You have to take them.

77
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,189
Have to take, do I?

78
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:20,470
- Down a bit, down. Open the door.
- The door won't open

79
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:25,317
What's going on?
Oh, bloody hell.

80
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,633
Who's coming with them?

81
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:41,549
Lakshman! Lakshman, you bastard!

82
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,271
The bastard's running away!

83
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,190
Running away?

84
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,352
They don't have anyone

85
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,276
What do you mean?

86
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,351
They use to have,
but now there is no one.

87
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,309
Is there any hospital nearby?

88
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:57,669
Don't know.

89
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,636
- Well, then?
- Must be one somewhere.

90
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,517
Where?

91
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,518
Who's going to pay
the bloody fare, then?

92
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,150
Run!

93
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,671
What a rascal!

94
00:16:58,760 --> 00:16:59,476
Shit!

95
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:14,478
Why did the bastard stop here?

96
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,754
What place is this?

97
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,958
They said he would take
us to the hospital.

98
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:33,115
Some bastards I don't know made me
stop the bloody car...

99
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,990
Now l have to find a hospital...

100
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:42,676
Why did you take us?
We could have died on our own.

101
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,792
I thought I'd do a good deed.

102
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:50,154
All my life I've been like
the shoes on my boss' feet.

103
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:57,316
And then that woman...
what she wanted to pay me with!

104
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:03,230
My lousy boss, he just wants
money and more money.

105
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,909
- Is this Garbandi village?
- Yes.

106
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,276
Is there a hospital here?

107
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:32,032
- Where do you take a sick person?
- To the crematorium.

108
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,755
Hey, Shubi!
Why are you running like that?

109
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,996
It won't be able to find it's way
back by smell. It'll be so confused!

110
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,080
Now it won't steal your dinner
any more!

111
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:50,472
If your eyes were covered could you
find your way home by smell?

112
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,831
I'd never want to go back home!

113
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:04,799
Well, we didn't see any hospital
today. Do you want to go back home?

114
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:06,717
No.

115
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,230
- You've got no one there?
- No.

116
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,192
Well, come with me.
We'll look again tomorrow.

117
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,072
Do you want
something to eat?

118
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:51,795
- The bastard's coming back.
- Take this.

119
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:31,033
FIRST STEP FROM EARTH TO MOON.

120
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:44,148
Hey, Lati! Shibu!
Where are you going?

121
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,913
Sir! Sir!

122
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,750
Aren't you coming to
school any more?

123
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,399
Mother won't let me, Sir.

124
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:03,994
Try to make her understand.
You've got such a good mind.

125
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:11,114
First in every subject in Class 6.
Do you want to drop out?

126
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:22,355
Look, Shibu, yesterday in class
I told you that a man is going to

127
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:26,756
the moon, and now it's here
in the newspaper.

128
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:28,715
Which moon, Sir?

129
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,268
Which moon? There's only one moon.

130
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,030
How strange!

131
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:47,829
One day I'll tell you about Mars.
There may be life there.

132
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:52,869
Who knows? There might even
be people there too.

133
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:59,392
- Do you still have your globe, Lati?
- Yes, Sir.

134
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:04,757
I bought that prize in Calcutta.

135
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,750
Will you come to my
house one day, Sir?

136
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:14,751
Tell mother to let me
go back to school.

137
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:19,114
She won't say no to you.

138
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,235
Let's see.

139
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:34,311
- Father!
-Hey, where have you been?

140
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,832
Just over there.

141
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,356
Pyarilal answers everything
correctly, doesn't he?

142
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:41,312
Yes.

143
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:46,390
Do you want to see?
Come over here. Stand there.

144
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:51,719
Father, ask Pyarilal
which of us is more intelligent?

145
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:58,318
Pyarilal, tell us.
Who is the most intelligent?

146
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:05,471
Oh, my goodness.
How clever he is, Shibu!

147
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:11,715
At night, who wets the bed?

148
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:39,715
Come on,
you'll have to sit in the back.

149
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:40,790
Why?

150
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,829
We're coming to the boss' place
I don't want him to see you.

151
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:15,990
How many times have I told him that
when he goes on hire,

152
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:19,988
he must be back by five.
But that bugger never listens.

153
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,190
I want to kick his ass!

154
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,793
The boss wants to go out.

155
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,035
The boss wants to go out right now.

156
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:03,112
Won't you let a man have a piss?

157
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:18,675
Keep your heads down.
The boss is getting in.

158
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:37,118
What was that?
What was that noise?

159
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:41,798
It's this bloody horn.
It keeps making strange noises.

160
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,150
What's that stink?

161
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:51,760
Burnt mobile oil. I'll have to
take it to the hospital.

162
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:57,312
- Why? Why the hospital?
- Well, don't you want it fixed?

163
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,078
I'm getting nervous

164
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:41,199
Don't complain. You've slept
with many men, haven't you?

165
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,998
It's just that I'm new here.
That's all.

166
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:49,149
It'll be fine after a couple
of nights.

167
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,788
If any customer kicks up a rumpus,

168
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,315
just get the chopper
from under the mattress.

169
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,792
I've come back after a year
and a half.

170
00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:01,676
When I left, I felt
relieved. But now what?

171
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,996
These men don't get any pleasure
from their dull wives,

172
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,998
so they come here.
Why else would they come?

173
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:13,870
I do everything, of course.
But my mind stays a blank.

174
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:45,956
Today's her first day here.
We've come to let you have a look.

175
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:49,994
How does she look?
Who got you ready?

176
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,992
The three of us all looked after
one another.

177
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,720
Any worst than your maid can do?

178
00:29:55,720 --> 00:30:00,840
You'll get many customers here,
but don't fall for any of them.

179
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,837
You have to flirt to
catch their attention.

180
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,229
With one hand take their money
and with the other.

181
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:07,080
And what do you take in the
other hand, Rajani?

182
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:11,073
Go away, you wicked girls!

183
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,840
Make it tight.

184
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:23,880
Why tighten it, Rajani?
Can you make yourself younger?

185
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:27,200
One day, you'll be sagging
just like me!

186
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,920
Why else would I be
a servant now?

187
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:33,230
That'll be long time from now.

188
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:36,360
Before I have to
arrange for my daughter.

189
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:41,275
Every night new rascals barge
into my room. I don't like it.

190
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:48,357
If only I could get a
patron for her.

191
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:54,993
He could take her away somewhere,
have her all to himself,

192
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:03,120
and provide for me too. I've spoken
to one or two men. Let's see.

193
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:08,672
Aunty Jamuna has been after me
for a long time.

194
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:13,358
The men she brought were demons
wanting only to devour the girl.

195
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:22,077
l've rejected them all.
Who knows what's in her fate!

196
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:41,038
- Will you give me credit?
- No way. Shove off!

197
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:44,869
Bitch!
Who do you think you are?

198
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:00,039
Let her go! Can't you see
she's not a prostitute?

199
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,835
Where have you been?

200
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,678
Why are you running?

201
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:19,239
- Mother.
- What's the matter?

202
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,349
Has someone done something?

203
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:24,111
Rajani... hey Rajani!

204
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,515
Bastard!

205
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:33,389
- Rajani, what's going on?
- Come here, you wench!

206
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,229
Go on now.

207
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:58,875
- Sir, do you want to have a piss?
- Why?

208
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:04,319
I want to tighten the horn.
It keeps making funny noises.

209
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:44,200
Sit quietly! Why are you
making those noises?

210
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:48,193
We've eaten, so we have
to let out some wind.

211
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:54,070
No more! If you do it again
I'll shove this car in your ass!

212
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,918
- What's that?
- Night fuel.

213
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:18,271
- Is there anyone inside?
- No.

214
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:24,995
Natabarbabu's here.
He's waiting in the car.

215
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:30,035
With so many men around
he doesn't want to come up.

216
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:37,154
Bring the girl down. Everything's
arranged for her good fortune.

217
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:45,036
Now let's see what happens.

218
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:49,716
But get her ready
to the boss' liking.

219
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:57,273
If everything goes well,
will you let me in free, for once?

220
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,872
You old fucker!

221
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:36,711
Lati! Come.
Let me do your hair.

222
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:42,038
- Why mother?
- You'll know later.

223
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,033
Where's your blue sari?

224
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,788
In the trunk.
Are we going somewhere?

225
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:55,154
- Do as I say!
- Why don't you tell me first?

226
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:58,271
Lati!
Turn around!

227
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:37,831
Let her hair down.

228
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,759
Turn her around.

229
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:01,790
Shut up!

230
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,116
No!

231
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:18,680
- What's the matter?
- Let me go!

232
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:40,479
Just what I wanted. She has a little
learning. That's good.

233
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:44,238
It gives her some polish.

234
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:53,115
Conversation is important.
Just a body is not enough.

235
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:59,150
l have so many things to say.

236
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:04,232
l have a wife at home, but.

237
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:09,719
When will you come and
finalise things?

238
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,229
The day after tomorrow.

239
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,153
In the afternoon?

240
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:14,674
Yes.

241
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:24,719
Look, here is India.
The Himalayas are on top.

242
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,711
Here is China.

243
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:37,917
You had history today, didn't you?
Did Abinash Sir teach it?

244
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:42,397
- What did he teach?
- The fall of the Mughal Empire.

245
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:46,149
Did he talk about Babue, Akbar,
Shah Jahan?

246
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:57,954
Do Champa, Mohan, Adhir,
Namita all go to school every day?

247
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,355
Yes.

248
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,837
Do they ask about me?

249
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,757
They've all forgotten me.

250
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:13,192
How could they? Nagen Sir talks
about you every day.

251
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:20,070
Will you ask Sir to come
and talk to mother

252
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:24,190
- into letting me go back to school?
- I'll ask him.

253
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:34,189
Did Sir say when the man
is going to the moon?

254
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:36,191
It'll be very soon.

255
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:42,317
Since I heard what Nagen Sir said,

256
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:47,238
I've been looking at the moon
every night.

257
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:51,797
I think I can see people there
walking on the moon and talking.

258
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,355
I can hear them talking.

259
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:58,793
- Lati. Hey, Lati...
- What is it?

260
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,791
Tell Shibu to go now.

261
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,718
I'm talking to him.

262
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:11,836
Don't you know your singing master is
here, you naughty girl? Come here!

263
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:17,316
- Go on! Aunty's getting angry.
- Let her get angry.

264
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:22,277
He teaches me such filthy songs
that 
 feel like vomiting.

265
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,713
Lati!

266
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:36,277
- What's the matter? Sit down.
- I'm not going to learn singing.

267
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:39,830
You won't learning singing!
It's for your own good.

268
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:43,754
You wretched girl, how wrong it
was to send you to school!

269
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:50,109
Don't squabble. If she doesn't like
to learn singing, then let it be.

270
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:53,398
Don't give in to her.

271
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:58,834
Natabar's man keeps telling me
that she must learn to sing well.

272
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:04,673
- Which Natabar, Rajani?
- Natabar Paladhi.

273
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:16,039
He has an oil mill, a rice mill,
and a motor car too.

274
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:18,077
Don't you know?

275
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:23,878
He likes her, then?

276
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:29,750
Start master. It's getting late.

277
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:34,074
It's almost time to get dressed
and light up the lamps of hell!

278
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:37,869
The new girl you brought.
Bakul. l have to teach her too.

279
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:45,396
- Sit down.
- Sing with me.

280
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:58,113
O, my love, l have adorned
the unripe youth of my body,

281
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:09,193
come close to my bosom and ripen me.

282
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:15,995
O, my love, for you I let go of
both youth and life.

283
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:28,668
Fire rages in my heart. I'm ablaze
night and day. O, my love,

284
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:46,357
Rub your limbs against mine.
Make the fire go out.

285
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:51,833
Come close to my bosom and ripen me.

286
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:08,992
You haven't even opened your mouth.
Sing with me: O, my love

287
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:14,675
- No.
- Why not?

288
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:18,030
It's a very bad song.

289
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:24,794
Whether the song is good or bad,
it has to be sung as it is written.

290
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:28,230
The words are filthy.
They make me sick.

291
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:31,837
You talk as though you are from a line family.

292
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:35,829
You have to stay in this hellhole and
survive. You can't be choosy. Now sing

293
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:37,189
No.

294
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:44,753
I carried a daughter of Satan
in my womb!

295
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:47,076
it was a disaster
sending her to school.

296
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:50,835
I'll give her a few days. If she gets
on my nerves, I'll set fire to her face.

297
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:53,878
Lati! Hey, Lati!

298
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:17,995
Here, share this.

299
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:24,116
I still haven't found a hospital.

300
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:34,080
- Are you feeling any stronger now?
- Yes.

301
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:40,469
You'll have to stay in this
garage tomorrow.

302
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:45,673
I've got to take the boss out. I can't
take you if the boss is in the car.

303
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:48,997
Why? That's no bother to us.

304
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:52,318
Stupid! It is bother for me.

305
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:55,954
The boss keeps on dozing,
but what if he sees you?

306
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:03,472
Let me find a hospital first.
Must be one somewhere.

307
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:06,356
I won't give up.

308
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:14,233
- Can you play Ludo?
- Yes.

309
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:17,599
Do you want to play?

310
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:29,789
What's going on here?

311
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:34,079
A two bit customer comes into the
room and starts ordering,

312
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:36,674
- "Do this, Do that".
- Get him out of here.

313
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:42,672
- No, I won't go.
- l'll fix you.

314
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:52,472
I am coming back.

315
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:55,831
Aunty, Aunty Jamuna!

316
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:05,795
When a man feels me up,

 get the giggles.

317
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:09,193
It feels like I have a mole
lying on top of me.

318
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:12,079
To me it's more like a lizard.

 feel like vomiting.

319
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:14,794
More like a slimey snake coiling
around me.

320
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:17,190
I want to poke his eyes out.

321
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:21,798
All morning 
 rub soap over
and over myself.

322
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:23,712
But I can't get rid of the
disgusting feeling.

323
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:32,910
Tushi... Tushi...
You're a crook say it, say it.

324
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:47,274
Your father is a devil. Say it.
You're a sisterfucker...

325
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:54,794
What language are you
teaching her, Rajani?

326
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:57,874
Teach her the names of God!

327
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:05,668
God never comes into this
neighbourhood!

328
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:09,839
I'm teaching her the language
of the no goods who do come here.

329
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:22,152
The donkey's dad is here!
The donkey's father has come!

330
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:29,870
Come on, you sisters of the devil.
Get your clean clothes and give me

331
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:32,116
the ones for washing.

332
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:36,871
3 saris, 2 bedcovers.

333
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:46,112
Hey, Pyarilal, tell me,
who is your father?

334
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:58,998
Which of these whores is looking for
a patron for her daughter?

335
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:12,669
And which no good's son will go
to his pyre before anyone else?

336
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:25,198
- It's the end of the month.
- Basanti's husband is here again.

337
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:29,800
Where's Basanti?

338
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:34,794
She's dead, so she can't give
any more money!

339
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:49,271
Hey! This month's money...

340
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:16,233
- Aren't you ashamed?
- Why should I be? You're my wife.

341
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:20,030
Your wife?
Six months after our wedding

342
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:23,158
you sent a man to my room.
Aren't you ashamed of that?

343
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:25,709
You bastard! From next month
I'm giving you nothing,

344
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:28,798
- and that's that. You slut!
- You mightn't, but your body will!

345
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:40,756
My love, you have gone
and not come back.

346
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:51,318
We have not met for so long.
My heart is breaking.

347
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:01,717
Sometimes I feel I want to go
away somewhere.

348
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:04,995
- So do 
.
- Where to?

349
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:12,471
I don't know.
A place where no one knows us.

350
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:14,478
I want to go, too.

351
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:17,798
- Won't you cry for your mother?
- No.

352
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:21,111
We'll all be Tulsi's mother.
We'll bring her up.

353
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:26,159
When she's older,
she'll meet a real man.

354
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:30,873
Suppose we have the need for sex?

355
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:32,793
After all this?

356
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:36,799
In that case, we'll look after
one another.

357
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:10,718
What's up, brother? Do you want
me to miss the train?

358
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:15,271
Can't you see the car won't start?
It's not far. Walk.

359
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:21,272
- Walk! I've paid the full fare!
- So what? Start walking.

360
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:41,149
Hey! Will you give me a push?

361
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:07,712
Push harder!

362
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:17,712
- Do you recognize me?
- Yes.

363
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:21,712
That day
when you couldn't pay the fare...

364
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:25,999
Where are you taking them?

365
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:28,668
They're sick.
I look for a hospital for them.

366
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:30,796
l have to hide them from the boss.

367
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:33,235
I don't know
what will happen to them.

368
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:59,191
You are my moon in the night,
don't leave me in the dark.

369
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:09,078
You who light up my eyes,
don't ever leave me...

370
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:28,795
Dew cannot ripen paddy.
Rain can.

371
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:37,239
Words alone cannot
Fill the heart, touch can.

372
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:56,836
This is Germany. This is Italy,
and here is France.

373
00:58:59,360 --> 00:59:02,113
Do you know
what language they speak there?

374
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:04,235
French.

375
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:10,912
You know, Shibu, I want to learn
so much all the different countries,

376
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:15,157
all the different kinds of people.

377
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:20,433
Oh, Shibu, has Sir said When
the man is going to the moon?

378
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:21,716
Two weeks from Friday.

379
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:27,915
- Is that the truth?
- Yes, truly, truly, truly...

380
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:29,269
Can it be seen from our roof?

381
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:36,110
Yes. I'm not sure though.
I'll ask Nagen Sir.

382
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:41,475
- Has Sir said when he will come?
- Not yet.

383
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:06,718
What is it?
Do you want to say something?

384
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:22,235
Tell me.

385
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:30,234
Sir, will you please come? If you
talk to mother, she can't refuse you.

386
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:33,073
Maybe she will send me back
to school.

387
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:39,353
OthenNise I will be in
terrible trouble.

388
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:42,759
What sort of trouble?

389
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:54,400
You really love studying,
don't you?

390
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:04,990
Go back now. I'll come and see
your mother in a couple of days.

391
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:49,793
Lati!

392
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:10,676
I'm very happy seeing your daughter.

393
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:21,876
l have a wife at home. l have
children and they have children,

394
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:28,151
my grandchildren. OthenNise
I would have called a priest,

395
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:30,834
and married her straightaway.

396
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:37,116
But don't worry. I'll make your
daughter even happier than a wife.

397
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:43,877
Lati has caught the eye of such a
great man like you.

398
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:46,071
This has made her life worth living.

399
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:58,435
Your daughter is worth more than
gold. You too are still valuable.

400
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:00,989
But I prefer...

401
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:12,274
Now to business.

402
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:15,114
Go ahead, sir.

403
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:20,038
I've had a new house built on
the other side of the river.

404
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:22,676
I'll keep Lati there.

405
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:32,195
Two maids, a manservant,
a cook everything,

406
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:36,356
l have arranged everything.
And...

407
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:39,195
And what?

408
01:03:39,320 --> 01:03:43,791
Your daughter will be so well
looked after,

409
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:48,159
but how can her mother
stay here in this place?

410
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:49,918
Is it possible?

411
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:58,199
So I've decided that you
can pack up here

412
01:03:59,320 --> 01:04:03,108
and I'll take you along
with your daughter.

413
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:09,233
So kind of you, sir.

414
01:04:09,840 --> 01:04:17,110
I want you there as soon as possible.
If you can, within a couple of days.

415
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:13,999
I think the boss has got
his eye on that young kid.

416
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:17,473
And you are a part
of this. You louse!

417
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:25,079
No one knows what catches
the boss's eye.

418
01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:09,237
- Nakul, where are they all going?
- I don't know sir.

419
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:18,117
They also have families, and
homes and wives and children.

420
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:21,957
Do they talk?

421
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:30,756
They talk, don't they?

422
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:11,197
- Sir, can you tell me something?
- What do you want to know?

423
01:08:13,120 --> 01:08:16,157
Is there a hospital within
twenty miles or so of here?

424
01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:18,038
What for? The car?

425
01:08:18,320 --> 01:08:20,959
- Then?
- People.

426
01:08:22,040 --> 01:08:25,715
Why do you want a people's hospital?

427
01:08:26,040 --> 01:08:28,679
Wasn't there a cow's hospital?

428
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:05,117
Your voice is still so sweet.

429
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:26,468
Lati!

430
01:09:32,280 --> 01:09:36,956
What's the matter?
Come to my room now.

431
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:39,756
I sent for Aunty Bilasi.

432
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:43,110
She wants to talk with you.

433
01:09:43,240 --> 01:09:46,198
I don't want to go anywhere.
I don't like it.

434
01:09:47,280 --> 01:09:49,236
What's bothering you?

435
01:09:50,240 --> 01:09:54,153
Don't give me to that man, Mother.
Let me go back to school.

436
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:56,231
What are you talking about, Lati!

437
01:09:56,520 --> 01:10:00,035
It's a great fortune that you've
caught the eye of Natabor Paladhi.

438
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:05,069
You can live like a queen the rest of
your life, or go on living like this.

439
01:10:05,240 --> 01:10:08,710
Nothing but trouble on top of
trouble, giving your body to jackals

440
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:13,831
and vultures for a handful of rice
twice a day. You want that?

441
01:10:14,240 --> 01:10:16,151
Let me go to school.

442
01:10:16,280 --> 01:10:19,750
You'll see, one day
I'll take you away from here.

443
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:20,835
Shut up!

444
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:28,832
What?
How could you say such thing?

445
01:10:30,280 --> 01:10:36,116
It's for your happiness
that l have managed to get Natobar.

446
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:41,272
How can you
think I'm selling you?

447
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:45,796
You'll do as I say!

448
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:47,952
- No. I won't
- Lati!

449
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:58,188
The evening lamps are lit
in the courtyard of my mind,

450
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:08,271
where a honey bee
sings its song and silently flies away.

451
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:24,076
Greet Aunty.
Listen carefully to what she says.

452
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:28,193
What a valuable treasure, Rajani.

453
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:35,752
You've looked after her well.

454
01:11:38,240 --> 01:11:40,754
Here, take one.

455
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:46,109
Sit down.

456
01:11:56,000 --> 01:12:07,036
Listen. You can't hold a man
with beauty alone. You need wiles.

457
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:20,869
You must learn them.
Both body and mind are involved.

458
01:12:24,200 --> 01:12:32,232
If you learn to beguile a man, you'll
keep him in the palm of your hand.

459
01:12:33,160 --> 01:12:37,870
If you don't, he'll sink
his fangs into you and

460
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:43,713
the poison will last
through seven rebirths.

461
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:53,351
I will teach you everything.

462
01:13:34,760 --> 01:13:36,318
What is it, Sir?

463
01:13:52,280 --> 01:13:56,751
I can't ask a gentleman like you
to sit in my room.

464
01:13:56,960 --> 01:13:59,838
Please, let's stay out here.

465
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:04,799
OK What I have
to say can be said out here.

466
01:14:07,720 --> 01:14:12,271
Your daughter has such ability,
such aptitude for learning.

467
01:14:14,720 --> 01:14:18,793
You must send her back to school.
Don't let her talent be wasted.

468
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:21,838
Don't you know we are stuck
in a swamp?

469
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:27,277
What is the need for learning
for our girls?

470
01:14:29,320 --> 01:14:34,189
Lati can read three or four pages which
is more than anyone else here can do.

471
01:14:34,840 --> 01:14:37,035
Don't ask for her to study
any more.

472
01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:39,749
You're not making any sense.

473
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:43,360
Look, if I were going to
stay here,

474
01:14:43,960 --> 01:14:47,111
I would insist on taking
her back to school.

475
01:14:47,440 --> 01:14:51,115
But next week I am leaving the
school and going to Calcutta.

476
01:14:53,880 --> 01:14:57,839
I don't have any children. Let me
take Lati to Calcutta.

477
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:02,189
Why waste such a will to study?

478
01:15:03,320 --> 01:15:05,197
No. That can't be.

479
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:07,069
Why not?

480
01:15:08,120 --> 01:15:10,793
We have certain customs in our
community.

481
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:15,318
Arrangements have been made
for Lati to start her career.

482
01:15:15,800 --> 01:15:18,997
I can't send her to
Calcutta with you now.

483
01:15:19,720 --> 01:15:25,078
You see, we can run our business
only as long as our bodies allow.

484
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:30,078
Without her, I would starve in future.

485
01:15:30,840 --> 01:15:36,073
In that case, I can say no more.
I'll be here for a few more days.

486
01:15:36,200 --> 01:15:39,192
If you change your mind,
let me know.

487
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:45,352
You're not going to stay here, Sir?

488
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:55,110
You know, Lati, a man is going
to the moon.

489
01:15:55,320 --> 01:16:00,030
This Friday the whole world
will be holding its breath.

490
01:16:00,200 --> 01:16:02,714
I am going to Calcutta
on the same day.

491
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:07,232
It will all be in the Calcutta papers.
I'll send them to the school.

492
01:16:08,240 --> 01:16:10,959
If you go there, you can read
about it.

493
01:16:18,280 --> 01:16:21,158
You think I don't know
who called the schoolmaster?

494
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:24,750
Early this Friday Natobar Paladhi's
car will come for us.

495
01:16:25,200 --> 01:16:29,034
That is an auspicious day.
Until then you won't go anywhere.

496
01:16:29,240 --> 01:16:32,676
I'll be relieved to hand you over
to your new owner!

497
01:16:47,160 --> 01:16:50,038
Hey, schoolmaster,
did the mother agree?

498
01:16:50,200 --> 01:16:51,155
No.

499
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:56,072
I knew it. You should have sent
the whore to school first!

500
01:16:58,840 --> 01:17:00,990
Did I say something wrong?

501
01:17:21,800 --> 01:17:27,989
Go to sleep my jewel,
go to sleep my treasure...

502
01:17:54,320 --> 01:18:00,509
Everything will be all right.
You'll see. I too had to start once.

503
01:18:04,160 --> 01:18:07,675
l conceived you when l was sixteen.

504
01:18:13,480 --> 01:18:19,237
The man went to the city and
never came back.

505
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,116
Haven't I suffered?

506
01:18:33,200 --> 01:18:37,273
You are a hundred thousand
times better off than I was.

507
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:18,716
I won't give you another penny!
Not a cent!

508
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:23,950
If you don't leave right now, I'll
call someone to throw you out

509
01:19:24,120 --> 01:19:27,954
by the scruff of your neck,
you bloody dog.

510
01:19:31,160 --> 01:19:33,720
Are you going, or will I
call someone?

511
01:19:37,160 --> 01:19:40,994
Why are you still standing?
Get out!

512
01:19:41,720 --> 01:19:42,994
l'll scream.

513
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:47,277
Shall I call someone?
Won't you go?

514
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:22,316
He's given you so much after
only looking at you.

515
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:31,198
I pray that God makes you a queen.
For so long I have thought about

516
01:20:31,880 --> 01:20:35,395
getting out of here.
Now God has smiled on us.

517
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:40,356
Murder! Murder!

518
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:44,394
Oh! My God!

519
01:21:21,280 --> 01:21:24,716
I couldn't find a hospital anywhere.
Now...

520
01:21:25,400 --> 01:21:27,834
We don't need a hospital any more.

521
01:21:29,800 --> 01:21:33,110
What's the name of your village?
Where I picked you up?

522
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:35,239
Phaltapur.

523
01:21:35,880 --> 01:21:37,108
Where is it?

524
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:39,271
lt's next to Manahartala.

525
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:41,114
Where's that?

526
01:21:41,320 --> 01:21:43,788
I told you. Next to Phaltapur.

527
01:21:44,160 --> 01:21:47,357
What?
Can any bastard understand?

528
01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:51,110
- Do you know the road?
- No.

529
01:21:51,960 --> 01:21:56,351
Oh, shit! I can take you only
as far as I know the way.

530
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,150
Can you ask someone from there?

531
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:01,753
We're not going home.

532
01:22:01,840 --> 01:22:03,478
Really?

533
01:22:08,080 --> 01:22:12,119
It's better under the sky
than at home, isn't it?

534
01:22:30,120 --> 01:22:31,758
Six!

535
01:22:36,240 --> 01:22:38,834
Can you take me to the station?

536
01:22:42,160 --> 01:22:43,275
Get in. Quick.

537
01:23:13,120 --> 01:23:14,075
Run!

538
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:40,830
Sir!

539
01:23:45,240 --> 01:23:46,832
What's the matter?

540
01:23:47,200 --> 01:23:49,236
Take me with you, Sir.

541
01:23:49,960 --> 01:23:51,075
Where to?

542
01:23:51,240 --> 01:23:53,117
Wherever you are going.

543
01:23:53,400 --> 01:23:56,198
I'm going to Calcutta.
What happened?

544
01:23:56,440 --> 01:23:58,874
I'll tell you later.
The train's is starting...

545
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:02,715
Take me with you, Sir. If you
don't take me, my mother is going to...

546
01:24:03,800 --> 01:24:05,119
Come.
