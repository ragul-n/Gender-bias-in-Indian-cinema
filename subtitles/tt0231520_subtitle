1
00:00:10,443 --> 00:00:12,070
Ek Ghar - A house

2
00:01:34,127 --> 00:01:35,424
Namaskar.

3
00:01:36,629 --> 00:01:39,189
My name is Rajshekar K.S.

4
00:01:40,533 --> 00:01:45,232
I work in S & W Company
as a works Supervisor.

5
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:52,376
S & W means Shultz and Williams
- A multinational

6
00:01:55,148 --> 00:01:56,946
I was born and brought
up in a village.

7
00:01:57,984 --> 00:02:00,351
Kept slogging in the fields
throughout the year.

8
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,210
Is is any life?

9
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:04,981
Life in city is different.

10
00:02:05,658 --> 00:02:08,093
Here life is comfortable
and peaceful.

11
00:02:08,828 --> 00:02:10,557
That is why I have come here.

12
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,735
But...Haven't found a house yet.

13
00:02:17,604 --> 00:02:19,129
I'm searching still.

14
00:02:20,373 --> 00:02:23,707
Heard that you've a
vacant house in your chawl.

15
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:31,079
I mean that house... Oh, Sorry

16
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:37,181
Where are you working?

17
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:40,783
S & W- They make bulldozers.

18
00:02:45,031 --> 00:02:47,432
This is the fourth time I've
come asking for the house.

19
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:51,002
It is worth coming 40 times
not just four times.

20
00:02:51,437 --> 00:02:54,065
What does a house mean?

21
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:56,305
Just four walls?

22
00:02:57,076 --> 00:02:58,840
It is a place where one
gets comfort...

23
00:02:58,912 --> 00:03:01,882
...and his soul gets peace.

24
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:05,217
You can't get all
these so easily.

25
00:03:07,987 --> 00:03:10,388
That is why elders
say that...

26
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:12,816
A house is a path of enlightenment,

27
00:03:12,992 --> 00:03:15,620
staircase to heaven
"This never easy to attain ...

28
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:22,494
Oh, I didn't mean you,
but that 'multinational!"

29
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:28,204
Come...

30
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:36,071
This silver is not pure.
It is a bogus one.

31
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:41,081
How much are you expecting?
Oh! what a confusion...

32
00:03:41,187 --> 00:03:42,951
Everything is so topsy-turvy.

33
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:48,559
Life would be so boring
without these confusions.

34
00:03:52,031 --> 00:03:54,762
What do you want...?
- That house...

35
00:03:55,101 --> 00:03:56,591
Didn't I tell you earlier?

36
00:03:57,103 --> 00:03:59,071
I am in real need of a house.

37
00:03:59,305 --> 00:04:02,297
There is no vacant house here,
and even if it is there...

38
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:04,469
...] will not give it to you.
Understood?

39
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:38,670
These days one can't make out...

40
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:42,345
...Who is honest and who is a cheat

41
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:43,540
Who is good and who's bad. Come in.

42
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:46,983
Had I known about you,
that day itself...

43
00:04:47,053 --> 00:04:50,045
...would've given you
the keys of this house by now.

44
00:04:50,556 --> 00:04:52,217
Go in and set up your house...

45
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:55,489
...and lead a happy
and prosperous life.

46
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:09,400
He was not ready to give
you the house.

47
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:10,601
How did you wriggle it of him?

48
00:05:10,843 --> 00:05:12,572
It is all due to auntie's trick.

49
00:05:12,845 --> 00:05:16,247
You have to be a crook
to get your things done.

50
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:17,111
What do you mean?

51
00:05:17,216 --> 00:05:22,086
Auntie flaunted her influence
and got us this house.

52
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:24,147
How can auntie do all
these things?

53
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:25,486
Why should we bother?

54
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,292
Look, People say all sorts
of things about her

55
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:34,295
It would be better, if we
stay away from her.

56
00:05:43,443 --> 00:05:46,504
What is this?
- Cot.

57
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:50,513
A monster created by those
who stayed here earlier.

58
00:05:51,751 --> 00:05:54,982
Must have realized later
how ugly it is!

59
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:56,556
So, left it here and run away.

60
00:06:39,632 --> 00:06:41,828
An old lady is staying
in the opposite house.

61
00:06:42,034 --> 00:06:43,900
She became a widow when she
was very young.

62
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:47,304
Now whenever she sees a man
and a woman together...

63
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:49,871
...she leers at them
with saucer eyes!

64
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:13,793
Look here...

65
00:07:17,036 --> 00:07:18,765
Come...

66
00:07:28,414 --> 00:07:30,576
Leave it.
- Okay.

67
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,684
He is a wrestler.

68
00:07:33,719 --> 00:07:34,982
Under the pretext
of exercising...

69
00:07:35,087 --> 00:07:36,384
...stomps the ground all day

70
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:39,459
In the evening, reaches for
the sky, flying kites.

71
00:07:42,528 --> 00:07:44,587
This is our small world...

72
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:48,862
...the owner of this house,
old lady and this wrestler.

73
00:07:49,936 --> 00:07:51,233
And this...?

74
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:53,766
This is a shed.

75
00:07:54,106 --> 00:07:55,198
What do they do here?

76
00:07:55,374 --> 00:07:56,705
God knows...

77
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:38,571
This huge cot is not
meant for us.

78
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:39,941
Let us push this out.

79
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:12,904
This cot is bigger than
the door.

80
00:10:14,246 --> 00:10:16,214
Looks like it was born
right in this room.

81
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:25,385
Shall we also settle
on this divine cot?

82
00:10:25,491 --> 00:10:28,290
No. God knows who all have
slept on this cot before.

83
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:30,429
Several unfulfilled
wishes might be in it.

84
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:32,193
I won't sleep on this.

85
00:10:39,905 --> 00:10:42,135
Freedom!

86
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:46,911
How much have
I craved for this freedom...

87
00:10:49,015 --> 00:10:53,816
Bickerings of the village,
squabbling of the house.

88
00:10:55,955 --> 00:10:59,084
I thought that I would get
stuck there all my life.

89
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:01,988
Since childhood, I too
had a dream.

90
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:05,862
I should have a small
house of my own.

91
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:10,567
A small but exclusive one.

92
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:15,965
There should be green plants
and trees in the compound...

93
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:22,272
...with lots of flowers.

94
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:28,582
A lilting music from
from a distance.

95
00:11:28,654 --> 00:11:35,356
A swing in our compound...
- and a colourful fountain.

96
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:37,328
At night while lying
down in the terrace...

97
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:41,757
...under the starry sky we'll
share our happiness and joy.

98
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:48,197
A big compound with
high walls.

99
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:53,345
None will know, what is
going on inside...

100
00:11:57,183 --> 00:11:58,878
What foolish dreams...

101
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:20,797
What did you dream and
what did you get?

102
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:24,767
What a huge difference
between the two.

103
00:12:25,511 --> 00:12:32,110
Hey! Raji, Don't think otherwise.

104
00:12:32,618 --> 00:12:34,313
This house is also nice.

105
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,110
No noises like in the village.

106
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:38,885
No kids pissing and
shitting at our doorstep...

107
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:41,927
...no pit of cow dung in
our vicinity...

108
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:47,895
...no interfering neighbours,
just both of us.

109
00:12:49,201 --> 00:12:52,330
Look, how serene it is here.

110
00:13:09,688 --> 00:13:15,855
Most important thing is, there's
no one here to ask every month...

111
00:13:16,395 --> 00:13:18,864
" So many days have passed
since your marriage..."

112
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:21,700
"Has daughter-in-law...
even this month...?"

113
00:13:23,035 --> 00:13:24,560
"What is the problem Rajanna?"

114
00:13:26,505 --> 00:13:30,874
There is no one who would
cough on hearing the cot creak.

115
00:13:30,943 --> 00:13:38,943
Now we can make as much noise
as we want.

116
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:15,444
Raji...someone is breaking the door.

117
00:14:21,293 --> 00:14:22,522
Don't switch on the light.

118
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,608
Someone is breaking
the door of the shed.

119
00:14:42,648 --> 00:14:43,945
Who is that?

120
00:14:44,783 --> 00:14:47,650
Oh! workers in the shed...?

121
00:14:50,856 --> 00:14:53,052
They are unable to open
the lock perhaps.

122
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:54,251
Let me give them this...

123
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:03,528
Take this...
I am the new tenant here

124
00:15:04,503 --> 00:15:05,937
Perhaps it is rusted.

125
00:15:06,772 --> 00:15:08,501
Open with this.

126
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:21,778
Give it to me...

127
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:37,031
They want water...
- What happened?

128
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:39,929
Poor guys! Didn't have any
work for 3-4 months

129
00:15:40,005 --> 00:15:41,973
So they did not open
the shed. Now they've come.

130
00:15:44,576 --> 00:15:45,668
Here you go.

131
00:15:46,312 --> 00:15:48,076
Give me through the entrance.

132
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:51,548
It is so late in the night...
What do they want to do now?

133
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:54,881
Don't know.
It is a real junk yard.

134
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,579
Don't know what
they are doing there.

135
00:15:57,756 --> 00:15:58,882
Take this.

136
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:41,662
Give me some...

137
00:16:43,702 --> 00:16:45,830
How can one sleep in
this noise?

138
00:16:46,271 --> 00:16:49,241
Don't bother.
They'll go away in a few days.

139
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:54,242
Let us bear it till then.

140
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:06,242
Geeta...

141
00:18:09,354 --> 00:18:11,448
Auntie, when did you come?

142
00:18:11,723 --> 00:18:13,316
How cutely you sleep!

143
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:16,186
I could not sleep
properly last night.

144
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:19,196
Rajanna must not have
allowed you to sleep.

145
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:22,165
Let me go and freshen up.

146
00:18:23,035 --> 00:18:24,332
I am on my way to the temple.

147
00:18:24,636 --> 00:18:27,435
Thought of taking you along.
Will you come?

148
00:18:39,151 --> 00:18:43,019
How can you remain inside
with closed doors and windows?

149
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,279
I feel suffocated.

150
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:51,725
This noise...?

151
00:18:52,097 --> 00:18:54,623
It is from the shed.

152
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:57,427
What do they do there?
- Don't know.

153
00:18:57,503 --> 00:18:59,198
Who is the owner of the shed?

154
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:01,534
I don't know.

155
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,265
Why are you quiet then?

156
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:05,675
They aren't your kith or kin.

157
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,704
Why don't you complain?

158
00:19:09,515 --> 00:19:11,483
They might have their
own problems.

159
00:19:13,685 --> 00:19:18,020
If you're so noble then
soon you'll become an ascetic.

160
00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:20,683
What are you doing?
Your sari will get spoiled.

161
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:23,758
I will spread the mat.
- Leave it.

162
00:19:24,263 --> 00:19:25,958
Here, the life itself is not secure.

163
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:28,834
Why cry for a sari?
Sit...

164
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:38,136
Your decision to shift
to the city surprised me

165
00:19:38,577 --> 00:19:39,908
Why?

166
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:45,815
I am tired of chasing
the dreams all my life.

167
00:19:47,986 --> 00:19:49,420
That may be the reason.

168
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:58,326
Auntie,
How much does this sari cost?

169
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:02,526
Must be Rs.700/- or Rs.800/-.
Don't know.

170
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:05,862
It is very nice.

171
00:20:08,006 --> 00:20:10,475
Tell Rajanna.
He will buy one for you.

172
00:20:11,476 --> 00:20:15,777
But he may prefer to see you
without a sari on...

173
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:23,287
Where is uncle?

174
00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:31,259
Don't know where the
hell is that pimp now.

175
00:20:46,311 --> 00:20:49,975
Felt bad...?

176
00:20:52,217 --> 00:20:53,480
No...

177
00:20:57,289 --> 00:20:58,620
This noise...

178
00:21:04,396 --> 00:21:05,522
Won't you get me coffee?

179
00:21:06,565 --> 00:21:07,691
Certainly.

180
00:21:22,347 --> 00:21:24,247
Where did you get this monster?

181
00:21:26,251 --> 00:21:30,347
What did you say...?
- This cot...

182
00:21:33,558 --> 00:21:35,253
Rajanna seems to be a romantic man.

183
00:21:36,261 --> 00:21:38,195
He has got mirrors
fixed all over the cot.

184
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:44,197
Are you still working
in the same office?

185
00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:46,499
I have quit that job long ago.

186
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:51,407
These men come after a lady
if she is single.

187
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:54,806
The secretary there
was no different.

188
00:21:57,649 --> 00:22:00,778
"Shall I book a room?
Will you come to a hotel?"

189
00:22:01,687 --> 00:22:05,555
Rascal, When I didn't
oblige him ...

190
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:09,226
...he suspended me on false charges.

191
00:22:16,601 --> 00:22:18,501
One will go mad in this noise.

192
00:22:23,141 --> 00:22:26,133
Had you told me, I would
have vacated them in a jiffy.

193
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,709
Come, let us go to
the temple.

194
00:22:31,149 --> 00:22:32,514
No Auntie,
If Rajanna returns early...

195
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:37,179
Come on, don't talk as if
you alone have a husband...

196
00:22:37,656 --> 00:22:38,748
Come on, get dressed up.

197
00:22:40,225 --> 00:22:42,819
No, I can't come.

198
00:23:03,682 --> 00:23:05,275
Do you come here regularly?

199
00:23:09,454 --> 00:23:13,152
Not earlier, but these days...

200
00:23:13,325 --> 00:23:15,589
Come madam. Tell me, Come madam.
what can I give you?

201
00:23:15,794 --> 00:23:18,923
Vermilion, oil, flowers...
- Vermilion for Re.1/-.

202
00:23:18,997 --> 00:23:20,089
Okay, madam.

203
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,961
I feel my time has come
to bid good by.

204
00:23:25,504 --> 00:23:30,601
Is it your age to die now?

205
00:23:31,209 --> 00:23:32,699
Here, madam.

206
00:23:33,678 --> 00:23:35,737
Should death come from without?

207
00:23:37,015 --> 00:23:38,949
One can die from within as well

208
00:23:47,058 --> 00:23:54,021
These days, don't know why,
I feel scared.

209
00:23:56,067 --> 00:24:00,561
Often I get the feeling that
someone is knocking on my door

210
00:24:02,474 --> 00:24:05,171
But when I open the door,

211
00:24:06,178 --> 00:24:08,840
I see none.

212
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:15,845
Strange shadows seem to stare
at me through the windows.

213
00:24:18,023 --> 00:24:22,859
I feel, someone is there
to take me away.

214
00:24:24,529 --> 00:24:28,966
Is there any soul to share

215
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:36,169
my fear at home? Tell me...

216
00:24:40,011 --> 00:24:41,979
I get peace of mind here.

217
00:24:43,081 --> 00:24:44,242
So I come often.

218
00:24:56,428 --> 00:25:00,262
I get a feeling as
if I am finished.

219
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:02,998
Why are you blabbering
all these things?

220
00:25:06,538 --> 00:25:13,274
Not caring anyone, I wanted to
lead a life of my own.

221
00:25:15,447 --> 00:25:17,973
But the beliefs that were stuffed
inside me in my childhood...

222
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:20,644
...are still alive perhaps.

223
00:25:23,088 --> 00:25:25,455
As I grow older they
are kicking from within

224
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:28,724
I am afraid that...

225
00:25:29,995 --> 00:25:32,692
. this turmoil,
I might lose my aim

226
00:25:35,834 --> 00:25:38,166
It is better that
I die before It happens.

227
00:25:38,603 --> 00:25:40,935
If you talk like this...
I am leaving

228
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:00,622
Sorry auntie...

229
00:26:19,177 --> 00:26:21,339
Don't feel bad.

230
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,946
Spilling of Kumkum
is not a bad omen.

231
00:26:24,616 --> 00:26:27,483
Not worried about Kumkum.

232
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:29,721
One can buy more.

233
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:33,990
But... Poor kids!
Their Ice candy is wasted.

234
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:37,053
They must have bought
it with a great desire to eat.

235
00:26:41,199 --> 00:26:44,362
It is very difficult
to understand you.

236
00:27:14,733 --> 00:27:19,068
I think that this is the
landlord's move...

237
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:21,033
...to make us vacate
this place.

238
00:27:22,407 --> 00:27:25,433
Instead of making
these wild guess...

239
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:29,447
why don't you go and tell
them to stop their work?

240
00:28:03,415 --> 00:28:04,849
What do they think of themselves?

241
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:07,110
Why? What did they say?

242
00:28:07,452 --> 00:28:09,386
They said "Go to a movie.

243
00:28:09,821 --> 00:28:10,845
We will pay for the ticket"

244
00:28:11,956 --> 00:28:13,515
As if only they have the money...

245
00:28:21,733 --> 00:28:26,967
Listen...if we could talk
to auntie once...

246
00:28:28,773 --> 00:28:30,036
Did auntie come here?

247
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:34,804
No.

248
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:36,639
Don't associate with her.

249
00:28:39,451 --> 00:28:41,249
These people in the shed
may spoil our sleep.

250
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:43,146
But she will ruin our life.

251
00:28:47,959 --> 00:28:52,954
Geeta, Let's go out for a stroll.

252
00:29:11,716 --> 00:29:15,744
What a nice fragrance here!
Isn't it?

253
00:29:17,155 --> 00:29:18,850
Perhaps Champak flower
has bloomed somewhere.

254
00:29:23,528 --> 00:29:25,053
Might be there perhaps.

255
00:29:30,835 --> 00:29:32,303
Not this one.

256
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:41,571
Not this either.

257
00:29:50,221 --> 00:29:51,450
Not even this

258
00:29:57,328 --> 00:29:58,193
Not even this.

259
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:02,361
Is there really a fragrance or...

260
00:30:02,734 --> 00:30:05,328
...have we imagined for
our own satisfaction?!

261
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:13,636
Rajiv...

262
00:30:17,882 --> 00:30:22,217
So many flowers must've
blossomed in the village.

263
00:30:23,288 --> 00:30:29,523
Night-blooming cestrum, Plumeria,
coral jasmine, Jasmine...

264
00:30:29,894 --> 00:30:34,388
It is so nice and peaceful here...

265
00:30:35,867 --> 00:30:37,392
...just like in our village.

266
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:42,968
Gentle cool breeze, the silence.

267
00:30:45,076 --> 00:30:47,704
We've almost forgotten all these.

268
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,370
You wait here.

269
00:31:21,412 --> 00:31:27,545
Keep this Rs.50/-...
- Why?

270
00:31:27,619 --> 00:31:29,018
Make her sit in the back seat.

271
00:31:30,421 --> 00:31:33,857
Look, You are mistaken.

272
00:31:41,633 --> 00:31:43,692
Come, let us go...

273
00:31:50,708 --> 00:31:52,972
Hey! what is wrong?

274
00:31:53,144 --> 00:31:54,305
What are you up to?

275
00:31:54,612 --> 00:31:55,738
We are husband and wife.

276
00:31:56,114 --> 00:32:01,280
If so, what are you doing in
the park at 11 p.m?

277
00:32:02,654 --> 00:32:10,654
Take Rs.50/- more.
Take Rs.100/-, I say, wait...

278
00:32:11,796 --> 00:32:13,764
Take Rs.150/-...

279
00:32:47,999 --> 00:32:49,489
Geeta...

280
00:32:55,239 --> 00:32:57,037
Don't cry.

281
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:04,309
Geeta, I'm sorry.

282
00:33:26,904 --> 00:33:27,996
This is no good.

283
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:30,335
Give me your hand.

284
00:33:31,442 --> 00:33:33,536
How much do you want?
- This much.

285
00:33:33,611 --> 00:33:36,512
This is too much.
- Why not?

286
00:33:36,748 --> 00:33:39,479
Are you late to the
office today also?

287
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:42,051
Want to make a call?
Go ahead.

288
00:33:42,787 --> 00:33:44,915
Look, I can give you
only this much.

289
00:33:45,089 --> 00:33:49,458
Not enough. Give me Some more.

290
00:33:49,627 --> 00:33:51,061
Hello S&WwW?

291
00:33:51,662 --> 00:33:53,596
Hello?

292
00:34:07,512 --> 00:34:09,606
I warned you that
it'll be a nuisance.

293
00:34:10,448 --> 00:34:12,075
I feel sorry for you.

294
00:34:12,617 --> 00:34:14,085
Neither can you sleep peacefully...

295
00:34:14,352 --> 00:34:16,480
...nor go to the factory on time.

296
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:21,385
But why do you bear all these?

297
00:34:22,326 --> 00:34:23,623
Are they your relatives?

298
00:34:25,263 --> 00:34:29,894
They are outsiders to you.
- All are outsiders here.

299
00:34:31,669 --> 00:34:33,159
This is your place.

300
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:34,762
You can take some action.

301
00:34:38,643 --> 00:34:42,204
I wanted to.

302
00:34:43,147 --> 00:34:46,048
But...
... the law binds my hand.

303
00:34:46,984 --> 00:34:53,913
I wanted to throw these men
out and keep this chawl neat

304
00:34:56,327 --> 00:34:57,795
That was my dream.

305
00:35:08,406 --> 00:35:10,898
That phone is dead.

306
00:35:11,742 --> 00:35:14,541
Phone from that
public booth there.

307
00:35:18,149 --> 00:35:21,551
This shed will shatter not just
my dreams, but yours as well.

308
00:35:21,919 --> 00:35:24,479
So, you should do
something.

309
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:30,087
If you wish, you can
drag them to the court.

310
00:37:55,006 --> 00:37:57,600
What happened?

311
00:38:39,917 --> 00:38:42,579
I can't read English.

312
00:38:43,254 --> 00:38:45,188
Grandma,
we will send this to corporation

313
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:47,624
They'll get this shed vacated,

314
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:50,226
Just write your name here.

315
00:38:51,929 --> 00:38:53,693
I will not write my name.

316
00:38:54,131 --> 00:38:57,567
Once I signed some papers
and got caught in a mess

317
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:01,297
I don't wish to put
anyone else in such a mess.

318
00:39:01,439 --> 00:39:03,703
Actually we are in a mess
and not they.

319
00:39:04,608 --> 00:39:05,939
It is a simple thing.

320
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:09,314
You are young...
Get excited for silly reasons.

321
00:39:09,914 --> 00:39:11,507
You have no tolerance at all.

322
00:39:12,083 --> 00:39:15,542
How can all obey what you say?

323
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,514
Lord Krishna says in Bhagavad Gita.

324
00:39:18,789 --> 00:39:20,553
Those who live
A self centered life...

325
00:39:20,624 --> 00:39:23,116
...will suffer for
the Sins of others.

326
00:39:36,774 --> 00:39:38,105
You are right...

327
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:41,409
So, will you sign on this?

328
00:39:42,613 --> 00:39:43,876
What's the use?

329
00:39:44,782 --> 00:39:45,908
Move...

330
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:48,942
Aren't you disturbed
by that noise?

331
00:39:49,086 --> 00:39:50,417
Of course, I am.

332
00:39:50,688 --> 00:39:52,452
Even then you don't
wish to complain...?

333
00:39:54,859 --> 00:39:59,023
I wish to... But nothing
will happen by that.

334
00:40:07,271 --> 00:40:09,103
Listen...

335
00:40:12,543 --> 00:40:17,105
If you want to be happy,
then be thick skinned.

336
00:40:17,348 --> 00:40:19,646
If you want to be happy,
then be thick skinned.

337
00:40:22,953 --> 00:40:25,217
Listen to one more thing.

338
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:27,950
If you wish to sleep
peacefully...

339
00:40:28,025 --> 00:40:29,959
...then keep exercising the
whole day like me.

340
00:40:30,828 --> 00:40:32,819
Our body is also like a house.

341
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:35,264
Build it strong...

342
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:36,867
...and the rest will be fine.

343
00:40:41,071 --> 00:40:45,668
"Inquilab," Zindabad.

344
00:40:45,743 --> 00:40:50,806
Satisfy our demands.

345
00:40:50,881 --> 00:40:53,782
"Inquilab," Zindabad.

346
00:40:53,851 --> 00:40:55,819
Satisfy our demands.

347
00:41:24,048 --> 00:41:28,144
We don't issue license
to anyone without N.O.C.

348
00:41:29,386 --> 00:41:30,478
N.O.C sir?

349
00:41:30,554 --> 00:41:34,115
No objection from the
other residents of the building.

350
00:41:34,758 --> 00:41:37,921
Why didn't you object then?

351
00:41:38,229 --> 00:41:40,163
Why did you sign then?

352
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:41,992
But, I did not sign, sir.

353
00:41:42,066 --> 00:41:44,160
I have shifted there recently.

354
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:47,031
Perhaps the earlier tenant
might have signed.

355
00:41:47,605 --> 00:41:49,573
So, you knew it.

356
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:53,242
When you knew that
there was a shed...

357
00:41:53,811 --> 00:41:56,906
...you should not have
taken that house.

358
00:41:57,915 --> 00:42:01,408
It is your mistake.
We can't do anything now.

359
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:03,585
Then, whom can we approach now?

360
00:42:05,155 --> 00:42:06,816
This is not fair.

361
00:42:08,459 --> 00:42:10,553
If one gets beaten by a
hooligan on streets...

362
00:42:10,928 --> 00:42:15,126
...and the police say,
"why did you go there"?...

363
00:42:15,232 --> 00:42:16,461
Don't argue.

364
00:42:16,767 --> 00:42:21,034
If you need mental peace,
then stay away from the city

365
00:42:22,172 --> 00:42:24,334
We can't do anything
in this case.

366
00:42:24,808 --> 00:42:26,105
You may go now.

367
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:34,682
Rajannal

368
00:42:36,487 --> 00:42:44,487
Phone for you...
- Phone...for me? From whom?

369
00:42:45,029 --> 00:42:46,724
Your wife, go soon.

370
00:42:56,840 --> 00:43:00,504
Someone has come from
the city corporation.

371
00:43:17,194 --> 00:43:20,926
So, you did succeed in getting
the man from the city corporation.

372
00:43:21,031 --> 00:43:22,465
Then what?

373
00:43:22,566 --> 00:43:24,830
But... No use.

374
00:44:14,685 --> 00:44:16,676
I had brought all these
to celebrate my success.

375
00:44:20,758 --> 00:44:23,625
Those men in the shed might've
bribed the Corporation man.

376
00:44:24,294 --> 00:44:26,023
They had gone to the
owner to ask for money.

377
00:44:26,196 --> 00:44:28,824
What...? and did he give them?

378
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:30,459
Yes.

379
00:44:30,768 --> 00:44:34,204
Funny man. Encouraging
a robber to steal...

380
00:44:34,271 --> 00:44:35,796
...and warning the
police to be vigilant.

381
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:38,369
Listen, why don't you
also bribe them?

382
00:44:38,442 --> 00:44:40,638
Will your dad give me
money to bribe them?

383
00:44:43,147 --> 00:44:44,979
Will they be happy
with 10/- or 20/-?

384
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:47,811
Those rascals should be
bribed in thousands.

385
00:44:48,318 --> 00:44:49,911
Why are you shouting
at me for that?

386
00:44:51,221 --> 00:44:52,655
Can't I even say something?

387
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:55,458
What the hell are you all doing?

388
00:44:57,261 --> 00:44:59,025
First, learn about the
ways of this world, then talk.

389
00:45:31,128 --> 00:45:32,118
Geeta!

390
00:45:33,831 --> 00:45:35,629
What happened?
- What is this?

391
00:45:36,667 --> 00:45:38,066
Is this a house or a junkyard?

392
00:45:38,702 --> 00:45:41,364
I have told you not to comb
your hair inside the house.

393
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:43,898
Why do you sit idle at home?
Do some work.

394
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:46,733
I don't keep resting
the whole day.

395
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:49,379
I cook and manage the house.
Isn't that any job?

396
00:45:49,513 --> 00:45:52,778
As if cooking is a big
job. See the way you talk...

397
00:45:52,883 --> 00:45:55,978
Enough. As if factory
work is work and the rest...

398
00:45:56,053 --> 00:45:57,350
What did you say?

399
00:46:08,832 --> 00:46:10,357
All men are alike.

400
00:46:11,034 --> 00:46:13,059
They vent out all
their anger at home.

401
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:43,717
I have brought food.
Come on, eat it.

402
00:48:49,026 --> 00:48:56,057
To be angry for long
is bad for health

403
00:48:57,834 --> 00:49:03,671
Come on, eat it.

404
00:49:04,574 --> 00:49:08,272
Oh! my little doll...

405
00:49:08,812 --> 00:49:12,305
are you still angry?

406
00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:17,144
0.K. You be the baby and
I'll be the mother.

407
00:49:17,354 --> 00:49:19,584
I will feed you.

408
00:49:22,459 --> 00:49:26,020
Let me see, how can
I make you laugh...

409
00:49:26,096 --> 00:49:32,763
'Sweets, milk, and cream...

410
00:49:33,036 --> 00:49:36,097
...the cat is here to eat that.'

411
00:49:36,606 --> 00:49:39,007
Really, these people have
made life miserable for us.

412
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:42,275
Why don't you talk
to auntie once?

413
00:49:42,346 --> 00:49:45,475
We won't go to auntie at any cost.

414
00:49:52,456 --> 00:49:53,753
Is auntie's house so big?

415
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:55,815
Stop gaping and come inside.

416
00:49:57,961 --> 00:50:01,591
People look down at
those who come here.

417
00:50:14,144 --> 00:50:15,703
Leave that...

418
00:50:17,347 --> 00:50:22,410
So, at last, what a
pleasant surprise! Come in...

419
00:50:22,652 --> 00:50:25,121
Actually, we thought of
coming, but didn't get time.

420
00:50:25,655 --> 00:50:28,056
In between we had been
to our native place.

421
00:50:28,158 --> 00:50:30,889
Is it? Had you been to village?

422
00:50:31,928 --> 00:50:35,421
We have brought some
mangoes for you.

423
00:50:35,766 --> 00:50:38,895
Let me see...

424
00:50:45,442 --> 00:50:46,932
Trying to fool me?

425
00:50:48,078 --> 00:50:51,173
I know from where and why
you have brought these

426
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:58,952
Be seated.
I will be back in a minute.

427
00:51:03,427 --> 00:51:05,122
Don't know what she must've
thought about us.

428
00:51:06,163 --> 00:51:07,631
You are really...

429
00:51:33,457 --> 00:51:35,585
Some man is there in the room.

430
00:51:39,529 --> 00:51:41,224
That is why I don't come here.

431
00:51:42,165 --> 00:51:43,826
Don't know what type
of men come here.

432
00:51:45,302 --> 00:51:46,394
What can we do now?

433
00:51:56,046 --> 00:51:58,140
He is that Police Inspector

434
00:52:05,322 --> 00:52:08,724
You know him, he is
Rajanna and she is Geeta.

435
00:52:08,792 --> 00:52:12,786
Hello! Namaste!
Please sit...

436
00:52:13,763 --> 00:52:15,993
She used to praise you a lot.

437
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:19,399
But I never got a chance
to meet you till today.

438
00:52:19,503 --> 00:52:22,200
Rajanna has brought some
mangoes from his village.

439
00:52:22,272 --> 00:52:23,603
Is it?

440
00:52:26,676 --> 00:52:28,440
I could recognise them instantly.

441
00:52:31,248 --> 00:52:33,273
Rural mangoes are
indeed special.

442
00:52:35,285 --> 00:52:37,754
They are very tasty.

443
00:52:41,525 --> 00:52:42,890
They have a complaint.

444
00:52:43,627 --> 00:52:45,959
I had told you about
those men in the shed.

445
00:52:46,396 --> 00:52:48,091
They make a lot of
noise the whole night...

446
00:52:48,165 --> 00:52:49,963
...and don't allow
them to sleep.

447
00:52:52,035 --> 00:52:57,565
So what? He is young
and has a lovely wife.

448
00:52:57,774 --> 00:53:00,368
It is a good thing if he is
unable to sleep at night.

449
00:53:01,044 --> 00:53:02,773
Stop chiding.

450
00:53:04,281 --> 00:53:06,306
See how you can help them.

451
00:53:07,184 --> 00:53:08,743
We can do nothing.

452
00:53:09,819 --> 00:53:12,345
If you file a case,
they pay the fine and get away...

453
00:53:13,089 --> 00:53:16,855
...and start again after a week
How will it benefit you?

454
00:53:17,727 --> 00:53:21,322
But they are killing us
daily with their noise.

455
00:53:21,765 --> 00:53:23,426
And you say that we
can't do anything.

456
00:53:24,901 --> 00:53:28,633
If we bash them up, you'll
file a case against us.

457
00:53:28,772 --> 00:53:30,171
Of course...

458
00:53:31,074 --> 00:53:33,304
Sometimes I feel like
committing suicide.

459
00:53:33,476 --> 00:53:36,104
We won't allow you to do even that.

460
00:53:36,279 --> 00:53:38,304
Then we will file a
criminal case against you.

461
00:53:41,251 --> 00:53:43,720
Your husband gets
Worked up very fast.

462
00:53:43,987 --> 00:53:46,012
Very interesting man.

463
00:53:47,991 --> 00:53:49,652
Wait a minute.
I'll soon be back.

464
00:53:52,729 --> 00:53:54,128
Saw, how he was staring at me?

465
00:53:56,533 --> 00:53:57,523
Lecherous guy.

466
00:53:59,536 --> 00:54:01,095
I should not have brought you here.

467
00:54:02,138 --> 00:54:05,301
Listen, ll can warn them ...

468
00:54:05,508 --> 00:54:07,101
...to work only during the day

469
00:54:07,510 --> 00:54:10,207
...and to shut the shop by Sp.m

470
00:54:10,413 --> 00:54:12,006
I think this will solve
your problem.

471
00:54:12,382 --> 00:54:16,114
Are you happy now?
- Yes.

472
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:18,481
That will be more than enough, sir.

473
00:54:18,989 --> 00:54:22,425
Thank you.
- My pleasure. Sit...

474
00:54:22,726 --> 00:54:24,285
But this is not fair.

475
00:54:24,761 --> 00:54:27,458
You've shifted the trouble
from Rajanna to Geeta

476
00:54:28,265 --> 00:54:30,666
Poor thing. She is at
home the whole day.

477
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:32,493
Now she will be forced
to bear all these.

478
00:54:35,238 --> 00:54:40,335
No auntie,
It won't be a botheration for her.

479
00:54:42,746 --> 00:54:44,908
Yes...

480
00:55:06,803 --> 00:55:08,862
Come here...

481
00:55:10,206 --> 00:55:11,765
Can't you hear?

482
00:55:12,208 --> 00:55:13,733
Come here...

483
00:55:15,845 --> 00:55:19,247
Hey get up...
- Why are you beating us?

484
00:55:19,349 --> 00:55:21,078
What are you staring at? Come on!

485
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:23,677
Move aside.

486
00:55:23,753 --> 00:55:26,654
Sir, please leave us.

487
00:55:26,756 --> 00:55:28,383
What are you doing?

488
00:55:28,491 --> 00:55:33,361
Leave them please.

489
00:55:35,465 --> 00:55:42,531
You rascals. May you
also die without a house.

490
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:46,833
What did you get by driving
we poor people outside?

491
00:55:47,143 --> 00:55:52,547
May your house burn to ashes!

492
00:55:52,816 --> 00:55:56,218
May you be ruined!

493
00:56:06,796 --> 00:56:09,788
Don't know what happened.

494
00:56:16,873 --> 00:56:18,204
You shouldn't have done this.

495
00:56:18,675 --> 00:56:20,109
Brought the Police!

496
00:56:20,577 --> 00:56:22,944
Washed dirty linen in public?

497
00:56:24,013 --> 00:56:27,039
Look, how they are being roughed up!

498
00:56:28,318 --> 00:56:32,016
Poor guys, how will
they face anyone tomorrow?

499
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:43,461
Geeta...

500
00:56:46,936 --> 00:56:49,064
They have small kids.

501
00:56:49,506 --> 00:56:53,374
Why close the shed and
make their life miserable?

502
00:56:53,610 --> 00:56:56,580
Why are you shattering
their dreams?

503
00:57:55,605 --> 00:58:01,544
Come here... come closer...

504
00:58:01,811 --> 00:58:05,076
come running

505
00:58:06,182 --> 00:58:07,843
come here... come closer...

506
00:58:08,751 --> 00:58:10,651
Take this. Come on.

507
00:58:11,821 --> 00:58:12,811
Come here...

508
00:58:53,494 --> 00:58:54,791
What are you doing?

509
00:58:56,564 --> 00:59:02,526
Let me hear the silence.

510
00:59:03,504 --> 00:59:04,801
Silence?

511
00:59:17,551 --> 00:59:22,785
Now I am experiencing the
thrill that silence gives you.

512
00:59:43,344 --> 00:59:47,281
Listen... I feel lonely,
sitting all alone

513
00:59:49,283 --> 00:59:50,842
Suppose, we had a child, then...

514
00:59:53,654 --> 00:59:55,144
This is the only thing
that we lacked.

515
00:59:57,157 --> 00:59:59,888
Be happy and peaceful for
some more time.

516
01:00:31,358 --> 01:00:33,258
Don't know why...
I am bored

517
01:00:35,663 --> 01:00:38,496
Some noise would have been better.

518
01:00:40,100 --> 01:00:43,400
This quietness is
ringing in my ears.

519
01:00:59,620 --> 01:01:01,281
Once there was a wrestler...

520
01:01:02,356 --> 01:01:06,020
...twice as heavy
as our wrestler.

521
01:01:06,994 --> 01:01:10,123
Once his girlfriend got annoyed
with him for no reason...

522
01:01:10,197 --> 01:01:11,392
...just like you're angry
with me now.

523
01:01:12,666 --> 01:01:16,830
So the wrestler decided to
cajole her with a gift.

524
01:01:17,104 --> 01:01:20,972
He went to a fancy store

525
01:01:21,041 --> 01:01:27,139
There he saw bangles, cosmetics,

526
01:01:27,214 --> 01:01:30,844
saris, sandals etc...

527
01:01:30,918 --> 01:01:32,682
Seeing all these the
wrestler got confused...

528
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:35,321
...couldn't decide what to buy

529
01:01:35,723 --> 01:01:37,782
Meanwhile a sales girl came

530
01:01:37,858 --> 01:01:39,223
...and asked him
"what do you want sir?"

531
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:42,627
The wrestler instantly
said, "bangle".

532
01:01:43,897 --> 01:01:46,093
"What size?" asked the girl.

533
01:01:46,767 --> 01:01:48,030
But the wrestler
did not know the size.

534
01:01:48,669 --> 01:01:49,761
The salesgirl asked
"who is it for, sir?"

535
01:01:50,070 --> 01:01:51,902
He said "I have a ...

536
01:01:52,906 --> 01:01:55,876
" You have held her hand, I am sure"”

537
01:01:55,976 --> 01:01:57,740
<i>Wrestler said, "yes".</i>

538
01:01:58,078 --> 01:01:59,512
Then she extended her hand...

539
01:01:59,646 --> 01:02:02,115
and said, "hold my hand
and see if this size is O.K"

540
01:02:02,649 --> 01:02:05,209
The wrestler felt her hand
and said, "yes, it's O.K."

541
01:02:05,753 --> 01:02:08,120
She packed the bangles
and gave him.

542
01:02:08,222 --> 01:02:09,519
But he still waited

543
01:02:10,124 --> 01:02:11,319
She asked him "do you
want anything else, sir?"

544
01:02:12,359 --> 01:02:13,724
The wrestler said...

545
01:02:14,027 --> 01:02:20,262
"well, She wanted a brassiere too.

546
01:02:20,501 --> 01:02:22,663
But I don't know the size"

547
01:03:29,069 --> 01:03:30,662
This noise has started again.

548
01:03:33,273 --> 01:03:35,037
They must be working
behind the closed doors.

549
01:03:36,176 --> 01:03:37,234
Noise...?

550
01:03:46,153 --> 01:03:47,643
They are deliberately
provoking me.

551
01:03:49,089 --> 01:03:51,717
See, I am getting goose bumps.

552
01:03:56,530 --> 01:03:58,396
I won't spare these rascals.

553
01:04:53,053 --> 01:04:55,078
What happened?

554
01:04:56,823 --> 01:05:01,784
Those people won't
hesitate to kill us.

555
01:05:03,130 --> 01:05:04,529
They look dangerous.

556
01:05:07,167 --> 01:05:11,570
You go to the Inspector
tomorrow itself.

557
01:05:27,921 --> 01:05:29,821
Did you meet the Inspector?
- No.

558
01:05:31,024 --> 01:05:32,253
You had told me not to go to him.

559
01:05:32,459 --> 01:05:33,927
Now, I say, you go and meet him.

560
01:05:35,062 --> 01:05:38,123
I won't go. He gives me odd stares.

561
01:05:38,999 --> 01:05:41,331
He merely stares at you
and not misbehaves.

562
01:05:42,069 --> 01:05:43,468
Go tomorrow itself.

563
01:07:06,853 --> 01:07:08,150
Why are you sad?

564
01:07:09,623 --> 01:07:12,058
What is wrong with you?

565
01:07:14,127 --> 01:07:18,997
Their loss is more than our gain.

566
01:07:20,734 --> 01:07:22,702
Thank God,
at last our problem is over.

567
01:07:24,004 --> 01:07:29,465
It's true...Inspector gets this
place rented for his nephew

568
01:07:31,745 --> 01:07:32,610
What ...!

569
01:07:56,169 --> 01:07:59,195
There he is. Come with me.

570
01:07:59,372 --> 01:08:00,840
Excuse me.

571
01:08:03,243 --> 01:08:06,269
Meet my nephew, Rajanna.

572
01:08:06,346 --> 01:08:08,212
Hello.

573
01:08:08,315 --> 01:08:09,441
The others are all inside.

574
01:08:09,549 --> 01:08:11,017
Why don't you please
come and join us?

575
01:08:11,084 --> 01:08:12,108
No thanks...

576
01:08:12,219 --> 01:08:14,119
We have been searching for
you since long. Come in...

577
01:08:14,221 --> 01:08:15,518
Yes, you must come.

578
01:08:29,402 --> 01:08:32,235
Shoot it...

579
01:08:34,541 --> 01:08:37,442
Shoot.

580
01:08:37,711 --> 01:08:41,705
Come on. Shoot it. Okay.

581
01:08:42,616 --> 01:08:45,642
Come on, you can do it.

582
01:08:47,954 --> 01:08:49,888
It is nice. Come on.

583
01:08:57,397 --> 01:09:00,128
First the red one and the blue one.

584
01:09:00,367 --> 01:09:02,426
Shoot it. Okay.

585
01:09:05,438 --> 01:09:08,533
Come on, shoot it. No.

586
01:09:09,109 --> 01:09:11,669
Press it again. - Okay.

587
01:09:11,778 --> 01:09:13,337
Come on.

588
01:09:19,853 --> 01:09:23,756
Have you come alone?

589
01:09:25,325 --> 01:09:26,622
Came out so soon?

590
01:09:31,498 --> 01:09:33,626
That was a real miracle.

591
01:09:33,934 --> 01:09:36,266
You've changed the fate
of this entire junk yard.

592
01:09:36,570 --> 01:09:40,370
See, how it looks like
Hong Kong and New York.

593
01:11:04,357 --> 01:11:05,722
There is a party.

594
01:11:06,793 --> 01:11:09,387
Auntie wants me to go with her.

595
01:11:11,831 --> 01:11:13,321
So, you are going?

596
01:11:15,735 --> 01:11:17,999
If possible...

597
01:11:32,519 --> 01:11:36,046
I will go. I am getting
late to the factory.

598
01:11:39,793 --> 01:11:41,454
Shall I take Geeta along?

599
01:11:44,531 --> 01:11:47,262
If she is willing.

600
01:11:52,339 --> 01:11:53,704
So, you...

601
01:11:54,774 --> 01:11:56,970
No aunty, I'm not coming.

602
01:12:00,180 --> 01:12:04,083
Then I too won't go
- Why don't you go?

603
01:12:08,121 --> 01:12:09,350
Are you upset?

604
01:12:11,291 --> 01:12:12,759
It is not his fault.

605
01:12:14,094 --> 01:12:16,859
Even my own shadow
doesn't trust me...

606
01:12:19,933 --> 01:12:26,066
I feel bad that you
both fought due to me.

607
01:12:27,407 --> 01:12:29,273
Had that rascal lived
properly with me ...

608
01:12:31,211 --> 01:12:32,906
.-.I would've had a
daughter of your age.

609
01:12:36,483 --> 01:12:37,541
Auntie...

610
01:12:44,057 --> 01:12:46,082
I have no one in this world.

611
01:12:48,561 --> 01:12:50,586
I belong to nowhere.

612
01:13:19,793 --> 01:13:22,558
Come auntie, I will come with you.

613
01:13:26,066 --> 01:13:27,363
Really...?

614
01:14:00,233 --> 01:14:03,168
Hey! What are you doing?

615
01:14:08,741 --> 01:14:10,231
What is wrong with you today?

616
01:14:30,830 --> 01:14:32,320
Auntie...

617
01:14:38,104 --> 01:14:39,435
Auntie...

618
01:14:41,741 --> 01:14:43,334
Where is auntie?

619
01:14:51,050 --> 01:14:52,711
Where is auntie?

620
01:15:45,205 --> 01:15:46,639
Why did you come away like this?

621
01:15:46,706 --> 01:15:50,973
Everyone started gossiping.

622
01:15:51,311 --> 01:15:52,745
Leave others.

623
01:15:53,646 --> 01:15:56,172
Our own people know all about me
yet they talk ill of me.

624
01:15:58,418 --> 01:16:02,946
I thought that at least
you both will be different.

625
01:16:05,858 --> 01:16:08,122
Don't think one can sit here.

626
01:16:15,602 --> 01:16:17,263
I was given to someone in marriage

627
01:16:18,504 --> 01:16:20,495
Like a devote wife
I followed him to the city.

628
01:16:22,675 --> 01:16:24,109
Within no time he realized that...

629
01:16:25,245 --> 01:16:27,270
...he can't shoulder
this responsibility.

630
01:16:28,748 --> 01:16:30,375
One night he ran away.

631
01:16:32,185 --> 01:16:35,211
Tell me, what could I
have done in such a situation?

632
01:16:36,556 --> 01:16:38,490
No one came to my help.

633
01:16:39,259 --> 01:16:41,159
Not even those people
who pass judgment now

634
01:16:41,928 --> 01:16:45,262
They expected me to fall
at their feet and plead...

635
01:16:45,598 --> 01:16:48,795
...so that they can chuckle
and call me a weakling.

636
01:16:49,269 --> 01:16:52,398
...and wash off
their responsibility.

637
01:16:53,740 --> 01:16:55,606
You are unnecessarily
finding fault with others.

638
01:16:55,808 --> 01:16:58,402
I heard, Uncle wanted you to
stay in his house, but you...

639
01:16:58,478 --> 01:16:59,741
Who, elder brother...?

640
01:17:03,049 --> 01:17:05,882
That was the last straw to
keep me under house arrest.

641
01:17:07,387 --> 01:17:09,651
I couldn't tolerate that.
So, I walked out.

642
01:17:11,824 --> 01:17:14,225
Ever since then I started
slipping in life.

643
01:17:17,196 --> 01:17:18,561
"Slipping"!

644
01:17:20,700 --> 01:17:23,226
Unknowingly we too
start talking like men.

645
01:17:25,405 --> 01:17:27,339
"Slipping"!

646
01:17:29,108 --> 01:17:32,339
No, that was not slipping.

647
01:17:34,914 --> 01:17:36,541
Had you stayed there...

648
01:17:36,849 --> 01:17:38,943
...you would've had a
house of your own.

649
01:17:40,286 --> 01:17:41,776
Do we ever have our own house?

650
01:17:42,722 --> 01:17:44,212
It is always 'their' house

651
01:17:45,191 --> 01:17:47,125
Father's house, brother's house...

652
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:48,828
...or else, father-in-law's house.

653
01:17:50,063 --> 01:17:51,895
Even you don't have
a house of your own.

654
01:17:52,665 --> 01:17:55,327
You stay in K.S.Rajshekar's house.

655
01:17:56,002 --> 01:17:58,471
Look, this is what I don't like.

656
01:17:59,038 --> 01:18:00,699
You have your own problems.

657
01:18:00,873 --> 01:18:03,035
So you taunt those who are happy.

658
01:18:03,209 --> 01:18:04,904
Where was the taunt?

659
01:18:05,778 --> 01:18:09,806
I am contended that at least
I am staying in my own home.

660
01:18:10,149 --> 01:18:11,514
How many women can say this?

661
01:19:04,337 --> 01:19:09,798
Hello, Mr. Rajshekar...
Here...your keys...

662
01:19:09,876 --> 01:19:10,934
Thank you.

663
01:19:11,043 --> 01:19:12,340
Your wife has gone out with aunt.

664
01:19:12,445 --> 01:19:13,537
She might be late.

665
01:19:14,013 --> 01:19:15,174
Okay.

666
01:19:16,115 --> 01:19:17,514
Why don't you come and
play some games?

667
01:19:17,950 --> 01:19:19,543
Let it be...

668
01:19:43,042 --> 01:19:45,943
You got him there...
good...

669
01:19:49,315 --> 01:19:50,714
Enjoying yourself...?

670
01:19:57,824 --> 01:19:59,019
Why don't you try this game?

671
01:19:59,091 --> 01:20:01,560
You might win something.
- No...no.

672
01:20:02,462 --> 01:20:04,226
Your wife's going to
be late anyhow.

673
01:20:06,265 --> 01:20:09,098
How do you know?
- But of course. Naturally...

674
01:20:09,202 --> 01:20:11,136
She has gone out with auntie.

675
01:20:12,839 --> 01:20:14,807
Hey! don't keep banging that one.

676
01:20:17,376 --> 01:20:18,673
Mr. Rajshekhar.

677
01:21:28,614 --> 01:21:36,044
Get up Geeta...
There are ants here.

678
01:21:37,189 --> 01:21:38,623
Get some turmeric.

679
01:24:12,845 --> 01:24:16,509
The problem with you
is that you need...

680
01:24:17,049 --> 01:24:19,916
...the comforts of
urban life along with...

681
01:24:20,152 --> 01:24:23,850
...the serenity of
rural life. Isn't it?

682
01:24:24,390 --> 01:24:26,950
Now tell me, what do you want?

683
01:24:29,662 --> 01:24:32,256
Sir, I wanted leave.

684
01:24:32,364 --> 01:24:37,359
But you have used up all
the leave due to you.

685
01:24:37,837 --> 01:24:41,933
If you continue like this
You'll be in trouble.

686
01:24:42,174 --> 01:24:45,166
Clear up the hassles
about your house soon.

687
01:24:58,791 --> 01:25:00,225
Can I make a phone call?

688
01:25:09,835 --> 01:25:12,827
Hello, It's me, Rajashekhar
Will you call Geeta please?

689
01:25:14,373 --> 01:25:17,240
What? She is not at home?

690
01:25:42,868 --> 01:25:44,063
Will you eat something?

691
01:27:54,466 --> 01:27:58,733
What has happened?
- What?

692
01:28:01,140 --> 01:28:04,337
Why are you suspecting everybody?

693
01:28:05,878 --> 01:28:10,179
First auntie, then
Inspector, now me...

694
01:28:11,650 --> 01:28:14,142
How can you be happy
if you don't trust anyone?

695
01:28:16,388 --> 01:28:18,686
You know clearly why I am upset

696
01:28:20,092 --> 01:28:21,753
Where was the need
for this pretense?

697
01:28:22,428 --> 01:28:29,630
Of course I did pretend...

698
01:28:32,604 --> 01:28:36,563
Not with you, but with auntie.

699
01:28:41,613 --> 01:28:47,985
She loved me a lot,
more than her own relatives.

700
01:28:50,089 --> 01:28:55,118
The love that she didn't
get all these years...

701
01:28:55,995 --> 01:28:58,430
...she desired that from me.

702
01:29:02,868 --> 01:29:04,563
But I couldn't reciprocate.

703
01:29:05,704 --> 01:29:07,035
So had to pretend

704
01:29:08,841 --> 01:29:12,277
This way, I was cheating
my own self.

705
01:29:14,179 --> 01:29:17,672
But tell me, how long
can I cheat my own self?

706
01:29:19,284 --> 01:29:23,414
Soon I got tired of this and
sincerely tried understanding her.

707
01:29:24,556 --> 01:29:28,356
Slowly I could understand
not just auntie, but everyone.

708
01:29:29,128 --> 01:29:33,793
You, me, the Inspector and
the people living in the shed.

709
01:29:35,534 --> 01:29:39,164
Listen, don't try to
convince me with words.

710
01:29:42,474 --> 01:29:45,273
In spite of my warning,
you went to aunt's place...

711
01:29:46,945 --> 01:29:51,314
...just to prove that I'm nothing.
I know that.

712
01:29:52,251 --> 01:29:54,185
Yes, You feel like that because...

713
01:29:54,987 --> 01:29:59,982
...you don't want to build
relationships with anyone.

714
01:30:01,927 --> 01:30:03,691
When you needed a house,
you praised aunty.

715
01:30:04,563 --> 01:30:06,554
To vacate the shed,
praise the Inspector.

716
01:30:09,201 --> 01:30:12,102
You didn't even spare me.

717
01:30:14,907 --> 01:30:17,137
When you were disturbed by
the noise of the shed...

718
01:30:17,276 --> 01:30:18,971
...you sent me to the
Inspector...

719
01:30:20,746 --> 01:30:23,545
...though you knew that
I hated to meet him.

720
01:30:25,417 --> 01:30:28,216
How are you different from
those who exploit auntie?

721
01:31:02,988 --> 01:31:04,956
May there be a swing
in our compound and...

722
01:31:06,925 --> 01:31:08,825
...a colourful fountain,

723
01:31:11,597 --> 01:31:14,726
...music coming from far away...

724
01:31:17,603 --> 01:31:25,603
We will share our joy and sorrow
under the starlit sky.

725
01:31:41,260 --> 01:31:46,221
I feel, I am becoming
hollow from inside.

726
01:32:02,915 --> 01:32:04,849
Auntie also used to say like this.

727
01:32:06,885 --> 01:32:10,185
No Raji,
We will not allow this to happen.

728
01:32:38,217 --> 01:32:40,015
I want the address of
the men who worked in the shed.

729
01:32:41,887 --> 01:32:43,946
I wish to change my house again.

730
01:32:48,927 --> 01:32:54,127
They always said,"
allow us to stay here...

731
01:32:55,067 --> 01:32:56,967
...and we will get you
a nice house in return'”

732
01:32:58,403 --> 01:33:02,601
I can't understand
what your problem is!

733
01:33:03,542 --> 01:33:06,204
You wanted me to evict
them and I did that.

734
01:33:06,411 --> 01:33:08,106
You have started it again.

735
01:33:09,381 --> 01:33:11,145
Those people in the shed have left.

736
01:33:12,751 --> 01:33:14,913
But now the Inspector's
relatives have come.

737
01:33:17,256 --> 01:33:19,384
I can't put up with the Inspector.

738
01:33:21,193 --> 01:33:23,753
You have to select one of us.

739
01:33:25,397 --> 01:33:28,560
O.K. I will give you their address.

740
01:34:03,935 --> 01:34:07,735
Listen, Where is Sultana playa?

741
01:34:07,939 --> 01:34:09,464
Those huts there

742
01:34:10,742 --> 01:34:11,971
Hut...?

743
01:34:12,210 --> 01:34:15,578
Yes, there's one in the front...

744
01:34:16,581 --> 01:34:19,107
The owner was saying
that he had a big house.

745
01:35:02,627 --> 01:35:09,499
Move aside. How many
times should I tell you?

746
01:35:21,480 --> 01:35:26,145
Move aside.

747
01:36:14,699 --> 01:36:17,361
Where have you gone
my child, Babu...?

748
01:36:18,703 --> 01:36:26,235
Where have you gone
my child, Babu...?

749
01:36:26,711 --> 01:36:30,306
Where have you gone
my child, Babu...?

750
01:36:30,749 --> 01:36:34,515
Where can I find my boy?

751
01:36:35,687 --> 01:36:42,150
Babu...?

752
01:36:43,261 --> 01:36:48,028
Where have you gone
my child, Babu...?

753
01:36:48,300 --> 01:36:52,168
Where can I find my boy?

754
01:36:54,873 --> 01:36:56,432
One house.
