1
00:00:02,432 --> 00:00:04,229
What's wrong with this city?

2
00:00:04,735 --> 00:00:07,704
Somewhere there are ashes
and somewhere smoke.

3
00:00:08,438 --> 00:00:10,372
Why doesn't someone say something?

4
00:00:10,707 --> 00:00:13,369
Why do we endure smoke quietly?

5
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:15,837
Now it's the limit of endurance.

6
00:00:16,313 --> 00:00:19,373
Let's bring this reckless
act to an end.

7
00:00:19,683 --> 00:00:22,049
Smoking at public places is prohibited.

8
00:00:22,252 --> 00:00:24,379
Violation will lead to penalty.

9
00:00:24,621 --> 00:00:27,647
Don't smoke. Or let others smoke.

10
00:00:28,959 --> 00:00:30,799
You will have to pay
a heavy price for smoking.

11
00:00:35,532 --> 00:00:37,159
Who doesn't want to be happy?

12
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:42,168
But at what price?

13
00:00:42,973 --> 00:00:45,806
You will have to pay
a heavy price for smoking.

14
00:00:47,577 --> 00:00:50,876
Smoking is injurious for you.

15
00:00:53,383 --> 00:00:55,408
And for your dear ones.

16
00:00:59,589 --> 00:01:01,682
You will have to pay
a heavy price for smoking.

17
00:02:38,355 --> 00:02:39,481
Kiran...

18
00:02:40,323 --> 00:02:42,757
You wait here.
I'll be right back.

19
00:02:48,164 --> 00:02:49,222
- Oh, Mr. Dubey!

20
00:02:49,399 --> 00:02:51,119
Good morning! - Good morning!
- Have a seat!

21
00:02:52,135 --> 00:02:54,103
No matter what day of the week it is...

22
00:02:54,604 --> 00:02:56,834
...you always show up
here to put pressure on me.

23
00:02:57,307 --> 00:03:00,572
Well, all I need
from you is my pension.

24
00:03:00,644 --> 00:03:02,009
After that...

25
00:03:02,445 --> 00:03:05,642
In any case, I don't enjoy
unnecessarily doing the rounds here.

26
00:03:05,715 --> 00:03:08,946
No, no... do the rounds!
It's good exercise!

27
00:03:09,019 --> 00:03:10,543
Listen...
- No, you listen!

28
00:03:10,654 --> 00:03:12,417
Look at this pile of files.

29
00:03:12,989 --> 00:03:14,547
And here's your file.

30
00:03:14,658 --> 00:03:18,560
When it reaches the top,
you'll get your money.

31
00:03:18,662 --> 00:03:23,531
My files hasn't moved up
for two years now.

32
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,365
Oh, Mr. Shinde!

33
00:03:25,435 --> 00:03:28,461
Try and bring Mr. Dubey's file up.

34
00:03:28,571 --> 00:03:30,596
I'm ready to do it, Mr. Sharma,

35
00:03:30,907 --> 00:03:33,671
but to reach the top,
it needs a little monetary push...

36
00:03:34,077 --> 00:03:38,104
And Mr. Dubey isn't ready to give
it the right push... what can I do?

37
00:03:38,815 --> 00:03:41,249
You people should be
ashamed of yourselves.

38
00:03:42,485 --> 00:03:44,851
I'm old enough to be your father!

39
00:03:44,955 --> 00:03:48,220
Then think of us as your sons
and give us the money.

40
00:03:51,027 --> 00:03:53,120
But remember one thing, Mr. Dubey...

41
00:03:53,663 --> 00:03:55,893
- Today you're our father's age...

42
00:03:56,299 --> 00:03:58,563
...but if you wait too long...

43
00:03:58,668 --> 00:04:01,268
...you'll be our grandfather's age
by the time your file comes up!

44
00:04:01,671 --> 00:04:03,434
The things you say, Gupta!

45
00:04:05,408 --> 00:04:07,672
Give me my money.

46
00:04:07,777 --> 00:04:09,506
He's lost it!

47
00:04:09,612 --> 00:04:11,705
Throw him out!
- You can't do this to me.

48
00:04:11,815 --> 00:04:13,077
Get him out of here!

49
00:04:13,149 --> 00:04:15,913
This is my life's savings!
- Out!

50
00:04:15,986 --> 00:04:17,476
I'm not begging!

51
00:04:17,587 --> 00:04:19,987
Don't show your face here again!
- Give me my money.

52
00:04:20,056 --> 00:04:22,115
Come on, come on.

53
00:04:22,192 --> 00:04:24,092
Please! Let him go!

54
00:04:25,128 --> 00:04:27,961
They're treating me like a beggar.

55
00:04:28,732 --> 00:04:32,896
Look where your file is going now...
right to the bottom!

56
00:04:36,473 --> 00:04:38,236
- How dare he manhandle me?

57
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:40,232
Get him out of here!

58
00:04:43,013 --> 00:04:44,241
Dad!

59
00:04:45,982 --> 00:04:47,074
Dad!

60
00:04:48,151 --> 00:04:49,151
Dad!

61
00:04:49,185 --> 00:04:50,618
Dad! Dad!

62
00:04:51,588 --> 00:04:53,112
Dad! Dad!

63
00:04:55,825 --> 00:04:57,053
Is my father okay?

64
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,094
Yes... Lt was a minor stroke.

65
00:04:59,195 --> 00:05:03,689
This isn't the age for him
to be getting into fights.

66
00:05:03,767 --> 00:05:07,965
But, Doctor,
that's his hard earned money.

67
00:05:08,071 --> 00:05:11,802
And at this age, he can only
support himself with his pension.

68
00:05:11,908 --> 00:05:15,173
- But another incident
like this, could prove fatal.

69
00:05:15,612 --> 00:05:17,580
- You have to keep that in mind.

70
00:05:18,148 --> 00:05:20,275
- It's a good thing
you brought him here quickly...

71
00:05:23,853 --> 00:05:25,445
Nepali and his two thugs.

72
00:05:25,955 --> 00:05:27,820
Looks like Samad Khan's work.

73
00:05:28,224 --> 00:05:29,224
Wow.

74
00:05:29,659 --> 00:05:32,184
You news guys know
everything before we do.

75
00:05:32,395 --> 00:05:33,657
What can I say, Inspector.

76
00:05:33,897 --> 00:05:36,229
Nowadays, we journalists
have to do your work, too...

77
00:05:36,299 --> 00:05:37,061
Oh, really?

78
00:05:37,133 --> 00:05:40,102
Sir, I've told you in the beginning...

79
00:05:40,403 --> 00:05:43,065
It takes Rs. 11,000
to fix this computer.

80
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,601
Now how can I give you
a discount of Rs. 2,000?

81
00:05:45,675 --> 00:05:47,575
Stop whining for Rs. 2,000!

82
00:05:47,644 --> 00:05:49,441
You're the one whining, sir.

83
00:05:49,646 --> 00:05:51,341
I sell hardware, not underwear.

84
00:05:51,448 --> 00:05:53,678
Okay, take Rs. 9,500.
Final.

85
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:55,044
Not a rupee more.

86
00:05:55,151 --> 00:05:56,209
Rs. 11,000 or else...

87
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:00,483
...I'll show your wife all those
porn films from your hard disc.

88
00:06:00,557 --> 00:06:02,752
Everything's been saved on this CD.

89
00:06:03,526 --> 00:06:06,188
Forget underwear...

90
00:06:06,496 --> 00:06:10,023
...your hardware
will turn into software.

91
00:06:11,234 --> 00:06:13,134
Relax, I'm giving you Rs. 11,000!

92
00:06:13,236 --> 00:06:16,637
Can't we joke around a bit?

93
00:06:21,678 --> 00:06:22,678
- Kalim!

94
00:06:23,146 --> 00:06:24,238
- Your phone!

95
00:06:27,383 --> 00:06:29,817
Here! 11,000 in full!

96
00:06:31,321 --> 00:06:32,321
Hi, Maya.

97
00:06:32,489 --> 00:06:33,751
- We need to meet...

98
00:06:35,158 --> 00:06:37,683
I think we've got our first case.

99
00:07:06,689 --> 00:07:08,953
- Who switched on these lights?!

100
00:07:18,635 --> 00:07:19,635
Quiet.

101
00:07:19,702 --> 00:07:21,294
Listen carefully.

102
00:07:23,206 --> 00:07:26,107
These time bombs
will now be activated.

103
00:07:26,776 --> 00:07:33,238
As long as you keep running around
this stadium... they won't go off.

104
00:07:34,918 --> 00:07:41,255
But if any one of you
stops running... BOOM!

105
00:07:42,392 --> 00:07:44,257
Why are you doing this to us?!

106
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:48,490
Because you three enjoy
making helpless folk...

107
00:07:48,565 --> 00:07:52,467
...do the rounds of
your office for years.

108
00:07:52,969 --> 00:07:56,564
This time however,
to save your own lives...

109
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,107
...you'll be doing the rounds.

110
00:07:59,175 --> 00:08:03,942
Listen, please...
We're ready to pay you anything.

111
00:08:04,013 --> 00:08:05,640
We'll give you money!

112
00:08:05,748 --> 00:08:07,409
Lots of money!

113
00:08:07,483 --> 00:08:09,644
That's the difference
between us and you.

114
00:08:10,186 --> 00:08:12,017
We don't take bribes.

115
00:08:13,456 --> 00:08:15,424
Please...
Don't do this, sir...

116
00:08:15,558 --> 00:08:17,150
Hello?
- On your marks!

117
00:08:17,227 --> 00:08:18,427
Is this the Aaj Tak News Room?

118
00:08:18,695 --> 00:08:19,525
- Get set!

119
00:08:19,596 --> 00:08:21,530
I have some a very
interesting story for you.

120
00:08:21,598 --> 00:08:22,690
Go!

121
00:08:29,072 --> 00:08:30,300
Hello, Police?

122
00:08:33,643 --> 00:08:36,339
Come on, Maya, let's get out of here.

123
00:08:53,997 --> 00:08:55,988
Keep running!
Don't stop!

124
00:08:56,366 --> 00:08:57,731
Keep running!

125
00:09:10,213 --> 00:09:11,840
Keep running!
Don't stop!

126
00:09:14,617 --> 00:09:16,016
Come on, keep running!

127
00:09:16,119 --> 00:09:18,883
Don't stop, don't stop!
- Get back!

128
00:09:19,689 --> 00:09:21,850
Keep running!

129
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:31,928
Bomb squad!

130
00:09:33,202 --> 00:09:34,362
Hurry up!

131
00:09:50,987 --> 00:09:52,545
Sir, it's just a firecracker!

132
00:09:59,796 --> 00:10:01,263
- In Breaking News -

133
00:10:01,364 --> 00:10:05,391
- Three government officials
were kidnapped by a masked gang...

134
00:10:05,468 --> 00:10:08,188
...who then made a tape of them
which they sent to all news channels.

135
00:10:08,204 --> 00:10:10,138
Let' see what they had to say.

136
00:10:10,306 --> 00:10:14,743
We've been talking about
fighting corruption for 65 years...

137
00:10:16,145 --> 00:10:18,636
...but nothing's really happened.

138
00:10:19,382 --> 00:10:21,646
We've only worn out our shoes
with candle marches...

139
00:10:21,918 --> 00:10:24,158
...landed up in hospitals
when we went on hunger strikes.

140
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:27,978
Peaceful processions only
got us beaten up by the police...

141
00:10:28,358 --> 00:10:29,757
Nothing ever changes.

142
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,560
But now, things will change.

143
00:10:34,497 --> 00:10:40,902
By punishing corrupt people
like Sharma, Gupta and Shinde.

144
00:10:41,738 --> 00:10:45,674
From this moment,
decent citizens like Makrand Dubey...

145
00:10:45,942 --> 00:10:48,172
...will not be victims of
corruption anymore.

146
00:10:48,811 --> 00:10:53,373
When, both,
the right and wrong way fail...

147
00:10:54,016 --> 00:10:56,075
...you have to take the middle road.

148
00:13:52,662 --> 00:13:54,857
- Sharma, Gupta and Shinde have
been charged with bribery...

149
00:13:54,931 --> 00:13:57,593
Manav, I want to follow
this gang's story.

150
00:13:57,967 --> 00:13:59,730
Alright. Do it.

151
00:14:01,771 --> 00:14:03,739
- As for the masked gang...

152
00:14:03,806 --> 00:14:08,641
...citizens have praised them
and also accepted them with open arms.

153
00:14:08,744 --> 00:14:10,473
- Let's hear what they have to say.

154
00:14:11,814 --> 00:14:14,942
They made those corrupt officers
dizzy by making them do rounds!

155
00:14:15,017 --> 00:14:17,542
It used to feel like being
retired is a crime in this country.

156
00:14:17,653 --> 00:14:19,644
By getting Mr. Dubey
what is rightfully his...

157
00:14:19,722 --> 00:14:22,555
...they've stood up
for every senior citizen.

158
00:14:22,658 --> 00:14:25,286
This gang that gave
the finger to corruption...

159
00:14:25,361 --> 00:14:28,353
...has a new name from the citizens...

160
00:14:28,598 --> 00:14:29,997
- The 'Ungli' (finger) gang.

161
00:14:30,232 --> 00:14:31,232
You were right, guys!

162
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:33,234
We have a name to
sign autographs with!

163
00:14:33,469 --> 00:14:34,697
The 'Ungli' Gang.
- Shhh...

164
00:14:35,004 --> 00:14:36,528
How cool is that!

165
00:14:37,239 --> 00:14:38,968
Don't talk about autographs
in a public place...

166
00:14:39,075 --> 00:14:40,736
...if you don't want a
warrant with your name on it.

167
00:14:40,943 --> 00:14:42,410
- Relax a little.

168
00:14:43,379 --> 00:14:44,812
- This is just the beginning.

169
00:14:45,014 --> 00:14:47,414
We still have so many things to do.

170
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:50,546
Guys, I was thinking...

171
00:14:51,821 --> 00:14:53,152
What's happened has happened.

172
00:14:53,489 --> 00:14:55,616
We've been lucky to not get caught.

173
00:14:55,691 --> 00:14:57,181
Let's not push it.

174
00:14:57,727 --> 00:14:59,194
What do you mean?

175
00:15:00,029 --> 00:15:01,496
Are you quitting?

176
00:15:01,697 --> 00:15:03,324
I'm just scared, guys.

177
00:15:03,532 --> 00:15:06,968
How can you even think of stopping?
- Shhh!

178
00:15:08,237 --> 00:15:09,295
- Especially now!

179
00:15:09,405 --> 00:15:11,896
Maya, this isn't a candle march.

180
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:14,809
I run my house on my salary alone.

181
00:15:15,311 --> 00:15:17,336
What'll happen to my
family if I go to jail?

182
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:19,772
Besides, who are we?

183
00:15:20,383 --> 00:15:23,875
A journalist, an intern,
a mechanic and a computer engineer?

184
00:15:25,221 --> 00:15:28,554
Beyond a point, we can't change squat!

185
00:15:28,658 --> 00:15:31,149
Goti... have you forgotten Ricky?

186
00:15:31,894 --> 00:15:33,191
- Let it be, man...

187
00:15:33,596 --> 00:15:36,497
We've chosen our path.
Let Goti choose his.

188
00:15:36,999 --> 00:15:38,261
Goti.

189
00:15:38,768 --> 00:15:40,167
There's no pressure.

190
00:15:40,236 --> 00:15:41,669
Take your time.

191
00:15:42,805 --> 00:15:45,103
Kalim, what happened
of our headquarter?

192
00:15:45,174 --> 00:15:46,607
I've found a perfect place.

193
00:15:54,483 --> 00:15:55,950
How much for this place?

194
00:15:56,018 --> 00:15:57,508
25,000 rupees a month.

195
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:59,144
25,000?

196
00:15:59,355 --> 00:16:00,652
For this hole?!

197
00:16:01,691 --> 00:16:04,524
At this rate, this is the
best you can find in Mumbai!

198
00:16:05,227 --> 00:16:06,660
It's completely central.

199
00:16:06,962 --> 00:16:08,224
There's a McDonald's nearby.

200
00:16:08,297 --> 00:16:12,199
There's also a an Udipi
restaurant and a pizza joint!

201
00:16:12,268 --> 00:16:13,633
With free home delivery.

202
00:16:13,736 --> 00:16:14,896
Wow!

203
00:16:15,137 --> 00:16:16,627
You should said that first!

204
00:16:17,707 --> 00:16:18,765
Guys!

205
00:16:18,841 --> 00:16:21,833
I think this place
is good for the office.

206
00:16:22,478 --> 00:16:23,843
What do you think?

207
00:16:25,414 --> 00:16:28,747
And between the three of us,
the rent won't seem so high.

208
00:16:28,851 --> 00:16:30,148
Actually...

209
00:16:30,786 --> 00:16:34,313
It'll be even less if
it's between the four of us.

210
00:16:36,992 --> 00:16:38,016
Sorry.

211
00:16:38,094 --> 00:16:39,561
I chickened out a little.

212
00:16:40,696 --> 00:16:43,995
It's not important
that you chickened out...

213
00:16:44,066 --> 00:16:46,364
...as long as you manned up on time!

214
00:16:52,942 --> 00:16:55,502
Mr. Dubey,
can you recognize those people?

215
00:16:55,911 --> 00:17:01,178
Even if I could, I wouldn't
tell you a thing about them.

216
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:02,847
How many of them were there?

217
00:17:03,152 --> 00:17:04,517
3... no, 4!

218
00:17:04,687 --> 00:17:06,314
Sir, one of them was a girl.

219
00:17:06,388 --> 00:17:08,652
What car is this?
- It's a Tata Ventura.

220
00:17:08,724 --> 00:17:11,818
This video was recorded a
few minutes after the kidnapping.

221
00:17:11,894 --> 00:17:13,088
- Note down the car number.

222
00:17:17,533 --> 00:17:19,797
- Sir, no garage has any information.

223
00:17:19,902 --> 00:17:21,563
- I think the number plate was fake.

224
00:17:21,637 --> 00:17:23,229
Sir, according to this lab report...

225
00:17:23,305 --> 00:17:27,002
...the security guards were injected
with a sedative called Midazolam.

226
00:17:27,109 --> 00:17:32,012
It's impossible to get this sedative
without a Doctor's prescription.

227
00:17:36,619 --> 00:17:39,281
We couldn't find anything
from chemists of hospitals, either.

228
00:17:42,658 --> 00:17:43,682
Sir...

229
00:17:44,193 --> 00:17:46,457
Before the Ungli gang
gets out of control...

230
00:17:46,529 --> 00:17:48,588
...we have to get Inspector
Kale on their case.

231
00:17:48,864 --> 00:17:52,630
Sivaraman, have you lost your mind?

232
00:17:52,701 --> 00:17:54,032
Trust me, sir.

233
00:17:54,303 --> 00:17:57,363
This way you can handle the
Thane district political parties...

234
00:17:57,606 --> 00:17:59,406
...and the public and
media will be assured...

235
00:17:59,441 --> 00:18:02,001
...that we're trying
to catch the Ungli gang.

236
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:03,942
Sivaraman, I...
- Sir, I give you my word...

237
00:18:04,013 --> 00:18:06,106
...that Kale will
not cause any problems.

238
00:18:06,582 --> 00:18:08,277
He respects me very much.

239
00:18:08,951 --> 00:18:10,418
I can handle him.

240
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:12,344
I've called him today, sir.

241
00:18:12,721 --> 00:18:14,848
He's waiting to meet you.

242
00:18:16,792 --> 00:18:17,850
Okay.

243
00:18:23,332 --> 00:18:25,061
How's Thane district?

244
00:18:25,134 --> 00:18:31,596
The officer before you used
to complain about the mosquitoes.

245
00:18:32,608 --> 00:18:34,405
Sir, I have no complaints...

246
00:18:34,743 --> 00:18:36,904
...the complaints will
come from the mosquitoes.

247
00:18:37,313 --> 00:18:40,111
Unlike the previous officer,
I don't eat sugar...

248
00:18:40,649 --> 00:18:43,140
...my blood is infused with salt.

249
00:18:45,087 --> 00:18:45,985
Kale.

250
00:18:46,055 --> 00:18:47,955
On my recommendation,
the commissioner...

251
00:18:48,023 --> 00:18:50,992
...wants to assign you
to a very important case.

252
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:52,820
Which case, sir?

253
00:18:53,262 --> 00:18:54,991
They call themselves the Ungli gang.

254
00:18:55,064 --> 00:18:57,589
They give the finger to
the system and law and order.

255
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,964
I want them found and stopped.

256
00:19:00,169 --> 00:19:01,193
Okay, sir.

257
00:19:08,611 --> 00:19:09,339
You can't go in!

258
00:19:09,445 --> 00:19:10,241
Move!

259
00:19:10,412 --> 00:19:11,845
Hey! What's going on here?!

260
00:19:17,853 --> 00:19:19,115
Where's Ansari?

261
00:19:19,188 --> 00:19:20,086
Tell me!

262
00:19:20,155 --> 00:19:21,383
What's going on here?!

263
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,559
What's up, Ansari?

264
00:19:26,762 --> 00:19:29,230
You're going to file a case, are you?!

265
00:19:29,999 --> 00:19:31,830
This is your final warning.

266
00:19:32,301 --> 00:19:36,067
If you don't take back
your lawsuit against Gaikwad...

267
00:19:36,138 --> 00:19:37,469
You're done for.

268
00:19:38,307 --> 00:19:39,706
Understand?

269
00:19:46,448 --> 00:19:47,642
Yes, Ali!

270
00:19:52,221 --> 00:19:53,381
When did this happen?

271
00:19:57,393 --> 00:19:58,621
Excuse me.

272
00:20:00,863 --> 00:20:02,091
Are you okay?

273
00:20:02,531 --> 00:20:03,531
Yes.

274
00:20:03,766 --> 00:20:06,064
My bones and spirit are intact.

275
00:20:07,069 --> 00:20:09,196
I'm not going to hide like a coward.

276
00:20:09,405 --> 00:20:12,568
I'm will file an FIR
against Gaikwad today itself.

277
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:17,171
Look what he's done to my computers.

278
00:20:19,248 --> 00:20:20,875
You'll be able to
recover my data, right?

279
00:20:20,983 --> 00:20:23,850
I'll try my best, Ali.

280
00:20:26,188 --> 00:20:27,485
Thanks, Gautam.

281
00:20:29,425 --> 00:20:32,155
He's been going to the Municipal
Corporation for 2 years now...

282
00:20:32,661 --> 00:20:34,959
...to get Gaikwad's
hoardings removed.

283
00:20:36,231 --> 00:20:39,257
Gaikwad's men threatened
him a few times.

284
00:20:39,802 --> 00:20:42,362
But he didn't give up.

285
00:20:42,771 --> 00:20:45,899
He's possibly thinking
of filing a lawsuit.

286
00:20:47,142 --> 00:20:49,167
- The FIR isn't going to do squat.

287
00:20:49,278 --> 00:20:52,509
The FIR is worth less
than the paper it's written on.

288
00:20:53,182 --> 00:20:54,843
He can't touch Gaikwad.

289
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:56,813
Yeah, you're right.

290
00:20:57,686 --> 00:20:59,813
The police have explained
this to Ansari already.

291
00:21:00,389 --> 00:21:03,085
Filing a case will
cause even more trouble.

292
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,887
Next week is Gaikwad's birthday.

293
00:21:06,996 --> 00:21:10,159
Just see how his
sycophants will fill...

294
00:21:10,532 --> 00:21:15,765
...every street corner
with 'Happy Birthday' posters.

295
00:21:19,742 --> 00:21:21,573
Next week is Gaikwad's birthday?

296
00:21:21,643 --> 00:21:23,076
Yeah. Why?

297
00:23:46,188 --> 00:23:47,246
Who's there?!

298
00:23:50,826 --> 00:23:52,384
Security!

299
00:23:52,728 --> 00:23:54,593
Who entered my house!

300
00:23:58,834 --> 00:24:00,165
Security!

301
00:24:00,402 --> 00:24:01,926
Security!

302
00:24:02,337 --> 00:24:04,100
Are you all dead?!

303
00:24:09,044 --> 00:24:10,375
Not a single wall was spared!

304
00:24:10,479 --> 00:24:11,605
Who entered this house?

305
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,408
Who did this?!

306
00:24:12,514 --> 00:24:15,950
I just asked you that,
why are you asking me!

307
00:24:16,485 --> 00:24:17,577
Who entered this house?

308
00:24:17,686 --> 00:24:20,177
Tell me! Where else are these put up?!

309
00:24:20,556 --> 00:24:22,046
Behind you?! There's nothing!

310
00:24:22,291 --> 00:24:24,282
Your...
- Behind me?

311
00:24:26,261 --> 00:24:27,751
It's behind me?

312
00:24:32,067 --> 00:24:34,001
- A message to all our politicians...

313
00:24:34,102 --> 00:24:36,662
This city is not
your personal property.

314
00:24:37,272 --> 00:24:38,933
It is the home of us citizens.

315
00:24:39,474 --> 00:24:41,806
And if anyone messes up our home...

316
00:24:41,877 --> 00:24:46,041
...then we won't hesitate
to mess up theirs.

317
00:24:47,516 --> 00:24:51,885
- Forget his posters in the city...

318
00:24:52,588 --> 00:24:56,024
Today onwards, Gaikwad won't
even pose for his family pictures.

319
00:24:56,325 --> 00:24:59,692
To hell with theory,
we love the Ungli Gang!

320
00:25:07,002 --> 00:25:10,768
- These politicians have ruined
the city with their damn posters!

321
00:25:11,073 --> 00:25:13,541
- This gang has taught
them a good lesson!

322
00:25:14,009 --> 00:25:16,443
This gang is really giving
the finger to corruption, huh?

323
00:25:17,379 --> 00:25:18,869
Not just the finger...

324
00:25:20,515 --> 00:25:22,642
...they're completely
exposing the system.

325
00:25:26,855 --> 00:25:29,483
It's been two days since
the Ungli gang struck!

326
00:25:29,925 --> 00:25:32,723
Are you chasing them or faffing?!

327
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:35,795
Sir, we are trying
our best to catch them.

328
00:25:35,897 --> 00:25:38,388
Well, stop trying and catch them!

329
00:25:38,467 --> 00:25:43,166
- Next time, it won't be
but a higher power who calls.

330
00:25:43,472 --> 00:25:44,837
Hang up!

331
00:25:46,208 --> 00:25:48,733
- Why are these amateurs
proving so hard to catch?

332
00:25:49,945 --> 00:25:52,778
What do you need
to catch the Ungli gang?

333
00:25:53,382 --> 00:25:55,373
Sir, the Ungli gang
thinks differently.

334
00:25:55,717 --> 00:25:57,014
Their method is different.

335
00:25:57,085 --> 00:25:58,279
Their purpose is different.

336
00:25:58,654 --> 00:26:01,714
To catch them,
we have to think like them.

337
00:26:02,424 --> 00:26:03,391
We'll have to do something different.

338
00:26:03,458 --> 00:26:05,255
Then do something new!

339
00:26:13,835 --> 00:26:14,631
Yes, Mishra, tell me!

340
00:26:14,703 --> 00:26:18,605
- Kale, my blood pressure
is off the charts right now.

341
00:26:18,874 --> 00:26:20,205
Did Nikhil do something?

342
00:26:20,609 --> 00:26:21,803
- What do you think?

343
00:26:22,511 --> 00:26:23,671
Okay, I'm on my way.

344
00:26:25,881 --> 00:26:28,645
- Oh, Kale! Come, come...

345
00:26:34,423 --> 00:26:36,118
What a fortunate man you are.

346
00:26:37,292 --> 00:26:39,123
As far as I remember,

347
00:26:39,528 --> 00:26:43,658
Kale didn't even go to
get his son's report card...

348
00:26:43,765 --> 00:26:46,097
...but here he is
for your report card!

349
00:26:46,635 --> 00:26:48,603
What has he done, Mishra?

350
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:51,136
Listen to this story, carefully...

351
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:56,837
...because I've never told a story like
this in all my 47 years in this job.

352
00:26:58,447 --> 00:27:01,348
- Last night, around 12. 30 am...

353
00:27:01,583 --> 00:27:04,108
...we got a call from
the Marine Line's girls' hostel.

354
00:27:05,153 --> 00:27:08,145
- Someone called the matron
and warned her...

355
00:27:08,557 --> 00:27:09,819
...there was a bomb in the hostel.

356
00:27:09,891 --> 00:27:12,052
Take your team and
check the first floor.

357
00:27:12,127 --> 00:27:13,424
Move fast!

358
00:27:13,495 --> 00:27:16,225
- You take your team
and check the second floor!

359
00:27:16,331 --> 00:27:17,764
- Check every room!

360
00:27:23,138 --> 00:27:24,969
What are you doing here?!

361
00:27:25,807 --> 00:27:27,240
I was missing you.

362
00:27:27,976 --> 00:27:29,739
Couldn't wait until morning.

363
00:27:30,545 --> 00:27:33,810
Did you do all this?!

364
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:40,014
Sometimes you have to use a
fake bomb to get to the real bomb...

365
00:27:42,357 --> 00:27:44,587
Are you trying to kiss me?

366
00:27:46,061 --> 00:27:47,688
It's what I'm known for!

367
00:28:00,175 --> 00:28:03,269
And now for the plot twist, Kale!

368
00:28:03,879 --> 00:28:08,873
- We traced the number
that called the matron...

369
00:28:09,151 --> 00:28:11,483
Guess where the call came from?

370
00:28:13,054 --> 00:28:14,715
From my landline!

371
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:19,117
A call from the Mumbai
Police Bomb Squad Chief!

372
00:28:20,762 --> 00:28:26,462
Now give me one reason to
not suspend this man right now!

373
00:28:26,568 --> 00:28:27,933
- One reason!

374
00:28:28,637 --> 00:28:32,903
Sir, I'll give you three
reasons to suspend me.

375
00:28:33,542 --> 00:28:35,066
One, I'm no good for this job.

376
00:28:35,377 --> 00:28:40,815
Two, my antics threaten to tarnish
my father's respect in the force.

377
00:28:41,283 --> 00:28:45,083
And three,
I don't think I'm going to change.

378
00:28:46,888 --> 00:28:47,888
- Look, Kale!

379
00:28:47,956 --> 00:28:49,446
Look how disrespectful he is!

380
00:28:49,925 --> 00:28:51,119
Get out!

381
00:28:51,293 --> 00:28:52,419
Thank you, sir.

382
00:28:54,129 --> 00:28:55,255
Thank you?!

383
00:28:55,997 --> 00:28:57,294
- You're laughing?!

384
00:28:57,499 --> 00:28:59,160
How was that funny?

385
00:28:59,267 --> 00:29:00,757
I'm sorry, Mishra.

386
00:29:00,836 --> 00:29:06,035
But even you have to admit; it's
an ingenious method to meet a girl.

387
00:29:06,808 --> 00:29:10,539
These methods will seem ingenious
if they're used to catch felons!

388
00:29:11,446 --> 00:29:12,879
Not to be a delinquent, yourself.

389
00:29:13,849 --> 00:29:15,976
His mind is no less
than any delinquent.

390
00:29:16,451 --> 00:29:18,043
And I don't want him in my squad!

391
00:29:19,454 --> 00:29:21,479
If you want to groom a criminal...
take him!

392
00:29:40,475 --> 00:29:42,136
Ashok! You?
Here?

393
00:29:42,544 --> 00:29:43,943
Come, come in.

394
00:29:44,179 --> 00:29:45,703
It's been so long.

395
00:29:45,847 --> 00:29:46,973
Sit.

396
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:49,981
Have some tea?

397
00:29:50,085 --> 00:29:51,085
No.

398
00:29:51,887 --> 00:29:53,115
Where's Nikhil?

399
00:29:53,722 --> 00:29:55,053
He's not home.

400
00:29:55,357 --> 00:29:56,688
He came and left.

401
00:29:58,293 --> 00:29:59,351
Why?

402
00:29:59,961 --> 00:30:01,428
What's he done now?

403
00:30:02,831 --> 00:30:07,393
If you hear the saga,
you'll start a war.

404
00:30:09,671 --> 00:30:11,161
I'm sorry, Ashok.

405
00:30:12,007 --> 00:30:15,773
You've done a lot for us
after Nikhil's father passed away.

406
00:30:16,645 --> 00:30:18,636
Arvind wasn't only my partner.

407
00:30:19,047 --> 00:30:20,412
He was my friend.

408
00:30:21,583 --> 00:30:25,383
Whatever I've done has
been for that friendship.

409
00:30:25,754 --> 00:30:28,086
I've tried to make
Nikhil understand...

410
00:30:29,057 --> 00:30:31,184
...but he's so stubborn.

411
00:30:31,893 --> 00:30:33,952
He's so like his
father in so many ways.

412
00:30:34,062 --> 00:30:35,324
Truly.

413
00:30:35,864 --> 00:30:37,798
But I haven't given up hope on him.

414
00:30:38,433 --> 00:30:42,733
Besides stubbornness, he
has so many qualities of his father.

415
00:30:43,338 --> 00:30:44,532
No problem.

416
00:30:44,806 --> 00:30:46,137
I'll find him.

417
00:31:17,138 --> 00:31:21,268
"Oh, girl your moves
Look so kinky to me"

418
00:31:21,810 --> 00:31:26,076
"Oh girl, your dangling earrings
Look so funky to me"

419
00:31:26,514 --> 00:31:30,974
"Oh that killer look you give...
Like the sharp edge of a knife"

420
00:31:31,052 --> 00:31:35,751
"Oh girl, your tantrums...
Feel so hanky panky to me..."

421
00:31:35,857 --> 00:31:40,419
"Shake those hips
to the beats of a song"

422
00:31:40,528 --> 00:31:44,794
"And make this pauper
heart feel like a prince"

423
00:31:44,899 --> 00:31:48,596
"Put those high heels on
And, dance Basanti"

424
00:31:48,837 --> 00:31:50,896
"Dance Basanti"

425
00:31:51,206 --> 00:31:53,265
"Dance Basanti"

426
00:31:53,642 --> 00:31:58,011
"Forget all the limits and just
Dance Basanti"

427
00:31:58,279 --> 00:32:00,247
"Dance Basanti"

428
00:32:00,882 --> 00:32:02,713
"Dance Basanti"

429
00:32:13,928 --> 00:32:16,294
"O when you see me you go wild"

430
00:32:16,398 --> 00:32:18,662
"You want my love you want it now"

431
00:32:18,767 --> 00:32:21,065
"You see me dancing up a star"

432
00:32:21,136 --> 00:32:23,297
"You know,
you know that I'm the bomb"

433
00:32:23,405 --> 00:32:25,771
"Oh when I pump it
up on the floor-ohh"

434
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:28,274
"I know the boys
be going uffo-oh"

435
00:32:28,543 --> 00:32:31,205
"And I'll be shakin' it up, takin'
it up, makin' it go, breakin' it up"

436
00:32:31,312 --> 00:32:32,904
"I'm gonna be funking it up"

437
00:32:33,648 --> 00:32:38,813
"Hey Basanti, where do you live?"

438
00:32:39,187 --> 00:32:43,715
"Hey Basanti,
open up the gates of your heart"

439
00:32:43,792 --> 00:32:48,422
"Oh, Basanti,
your smile's like an explosive"

440
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:52,557
"From head to toe, you're a missile"

441
00:32:52,634 --> 00:32:57,298
"Shake those hips
to the beats of a song"

442
00:32:57,372 --> 00:33:01,638
"And I'll take whatever
satisfaction I get"

443
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:05,339
"Handle your row of admirers
and just dance, Basanti"

444
00:33:05,814 --> 00:33:08,009
"Dance Basanti"

445
00:33:08,216 --> 00:33:10,150
"Dance Basanti"

446
00:33:10,418 --> 00:33:14,821
"Forget all the limits
and just dance Basanti"

447
00:33:15,256 --> 00:33:17,247
"Dance Basanti"

448
00:33:17,525 --> 00:33:19,550
"Dance Basanti"

449
00:33:21,596 --> 00:33:23,962
"O when you see me you go wild"

450
00:33:24,065 --> 00:33:26,329
"You want my love you want it now"

451
00:33:26,434 --> 00:33:28,493
"You see me dancing up a star"

452
00:33:28,603 --> 00:33:31,401
"You know,
you know that I'm the bomb"

453
00:33:31,473 --> 00:33:34,135
"And I'll be shakin' it up, takin'
it up, makin' it go, breakin' it up"

454
00:33:34,209 --> 00:33:35,676
"I'm gonna be funking it up"

455
00:33:42,851 --> 00:33:44,045
Yes, Kale sir.

456
00:33:44,352 --> 00:33:47,753
- Nikhil, meet me at
Lalit bar tomorrow at 7 pm.

457
00:33:48,556 --> 00:33:49,556
Why?

458
00:33:49,758 --> 00:33:51,521
Can't you lecture me on the phone?

459
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:54,285
- I'll be waiting
there for you, Nikhil.

460
00:33:54,562 --> 00:33:55,756
- Be there.

461
00:34:01,936 --> 00:34:03,767
- All I want is news
about the Ungli Gang.

462
00:34:03,838 --> 00:34:04,702
- What is this bullshit, ya?

463
00:34:04,806 --> 00:34:06,726
- Not a single concrete
report on the Ungli Gang.

464
00:34:06,808 --> 00:34:08,366
What the hell do you
guys come to do here?!

465
00:34:08,476 --> 00:34:10,603
Can you please disperse
and get me something concrete?

466
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:12,039
Go!

467
00:34:19,554 --> 00:34:20,851
Bad meeting?

468
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:22,882
Don't ask.

469
00:34:23,057 --> 00:34:24,581
Manav bit my head off.

470
00:34:24,692 --> 00:34:25,852
Ouch...

471
00:34:26,461 --> 00:34:29,658
So not a good idea to suggest coffee?

472
00:34:30,598 --> 00:34:31,622
Correct.

473
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:35,233
What's Manav's problem?

474
00:34:35,637 --> 00:34:36,661
This Ungli gang!

475
00:34:36,805 --> 00:34:37,999
Can't find a lead!

476
00:34:38,106 --> 00:34:41,940
And I'm getting cursed
because I'm handling the case.

477
00:34:42,443 --> 00:34:44,775
Can't understand why they're
getting so much importance.

478
00:34:45,046 --> 00:34:50,143
Seems like a bunch of spoilt,
rich kids who want a bit of fame.

479
00:34:50,585 --> 00:34:52,177
Oh, right, I nearly forgot!

480
00:34:52,253 --> 00:34:55,245
You're the famous crime reporter,
Mr. Abhay Kashyap.

481
00:34:55,356 --> 00:34:57,881
Why would these ordinary
cases interest you?

482
00:34:58,359 --> 00:35:04,059
You handle serious cases like murders,
gang wars and extortions.

483
00:35:04,399 --> 00:35:08,733
Thanks... You think I'm famous...

484
00:35:09,671 --> 00:35:10,695
You wish.

485
00:35:10,805 --> 00:35:17,267
And these spoilt, rich kids you're
talking about are a lot more than that.

486
00:35:17,345 --> 00:35:19,040
They're heroes in
the eyes of the public.

487
00:35:19,147 --> 00:35:21,513
And trust me, Abhay.
This is just the beginning with them.

488
00:35:21,583 --> 00:35:26,179
Seems like you're really
close to this Ungli gang...

489
00:35:27,388 --> 00:35:28,548
Bye, Abhay.

490
00:35:33,962 --> 00:35:35,953
Well done, Abhay.

491
00:35:37,465 --> 00:35:39,797
You should write a book
on how to win girls over.

492
00:35:43,271 --> 00:35:46,104
What's the update on
your love story with Teesta?

493
00:35:47,575 --> 00:35:48,974
Nothing, man.

494
00:35:52,814 --> 00:35:54,145
Listen to me.

495
00:35:54,382 --> 00:35:55,644
Let her go.

496
00:35:57,952 --> 00:36:00,182
If you don't mind,
can I get her before letting her go?

497
00:36:00,255 --> 00:36:02,935
If you're going to let her go,
then what's the point of getting her?

498
00:36:02,957 --> 00:36:03,957
Correct?

499
00:36:04,359 --> 00:36:05,553
Listen, listen.

500
00:36:05,627 --> 00:36:07,857
Abhay... listen.

501
00:36:08,129 --> 00:36:12,259
Teesta wants something
only you can give her.

502
00:36:12,901 --> 00:36:14,766
That only you have.

503
00:36:14,836 --> 00:36:16,133
Aye.

504
00:36:16,237 --> 00:36:17,704
Now you're being vulgar, Goti.

505
00:36:17,805 --> 00:36:21,263
No, man, I'm talking about
information on the Ungli gang!

506
00:36:22,277 --> 00:36:23,505
Shit!

507
00:36:24,379 --> 00:36:25,471
You're right!

508
00:36:25,546 --> 00:36:27,571
Why didn't I think of that?!

509
00:36:28,516 --> 00:36:29,516
Goti!

510
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:33,281
You'll get the first invite
for my wedding with Teesta.

511
00:36:33,721 --> 00:36:34,881
Thank you.

512
00:36:37,892 --> 00:36:39,450
You're driving drunk?!

513
00:36:43,831 --> 00:36:45,492
Show me your license?

514
00:36:45,667 --> 00:36:48,795
- Thank God it's only a dent
and they didn't kill someone!

515
00:36:49,671 --> 00:36:53,072
How do these underage
kids get licenses?

516
00:36:53,608 --> 00:36:55,408
The credit for that
goes to driving schools...

517
00:36:55,443 --> 00:36:57,638
...and corrupt Transport officers.

518
00:36:58,279 --> 00:37:02,909
- Getting a license is as
easy as going grocery shopping.

519
00:37:03,318 --> 00:37:05,343
These corrupt officers
would give a license...

520
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:07,718
...to even a blind
man for a few bucks.

521
00:37:10,425 --> 00:37:11,687
Wow, Kalim.

522
00:37:11,893 --> 00:37:13,292
What an idea!

523
00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:23,662
You move!

524
00:37:24,372 --> 00:37:25,600
Smile!

525
00:37:38,653 --> 00:37:39,813
Sir.

526
00:37:44,993 --> 00:37:46,824
Sir, the photo's okay, right?

527
00:37:47,195 --> 00:37:49,891
As long as the notes are okay,
don't worry about the photo.

528
00:37:50,298 --> 00:37:51,788
You'll get the license in four days.

529
00:37:51,899 --> 00:37:53,696
Go.
- Okay, sir.

530
00:37:55,636 --> 00:37:58,230
- What's the update
on the Orion group?

531
00:37:58,806 --> 00:38:01,673
We have a few sources who
are ready to share information...

532
00:38:01,776 --> 00:38:03,835
...on Agarwal's deals
and broker's information.

533
00:38:03,945 --> 00:38:05,537
The story'll be up in a few hours.

534
00:38:05,646 --> 00:38:06,646
Good.

535
00:38:06,814 --> 00:38:09,510
And what about the Ungli gang?

536
00:38:11,486 --> 00:38:12,214
Uhh...

537
00:38:12,286 --> 00:38:13,685
Please tell me you have something.

538
00:38:13,955 --> 00:38:17,584
No, Manav.
We don't currently have anything.

539
00:38:19,894 --> 00:38:21,020
Ya, Abhay?

540
00:38:24,098 --> 00:38:26,760
This just came in the post.

541
00:38:26,834 --> 00:38:28,995
It's from the Ungli gang!

542
00:38:29,237 --> 00:38:30,237
What's in this?

543
00:38:30,271 --> 00:38:32,705
Actually, it's fan mail...

544
00:38:32,807 --> 00:38:33,807
What?

545
00:38:33,808 --> 00:38:35,366
Read it and see.

546
00:38:36,044 --> 00:38:37,204
Hi, Abhay.

547
00:38:37,445 --> 00:38:39,572
Your crime reports
are quite interesting.

548
00:38:39,847 --> 00:38:43,305
Next time we give someone the finger,
you'll be the first to know.

549
00:38:43,384 --> 00:38:45,011
- Cheers. The Ungli Gang.

550
00:38:48,489 --> 00:38:49,922
Not bad, Abhay.

551
00:38:50,691 --> 00:38:51,953
Thanks, Manav.

552
00:38:57,999 --> 00:38:58,999
Abhay!

553
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:00,897
Abhay! How could you?!

554
00:39:00,968 --> 00:39:02,408
I had no idea you were so unethical.

555
00:39:02,503 --> 00:39:03,993
Besides, this was my story!

556
00:39:04,105 --> 00:39:06,972
You could have at least
come to me before going to Manav!

557
00:39:07,041 --> 00:39:08,702
We could have shown
it to Manav together!

558
00:39:09,143 --> 00:39:11,134
I've never been a fan of sharing.

559
00:39:11,446 --> 00:39:12,913
Don't be so jealous, Teesta.

560
00:39:13,214 --> 00:39:15,478
Relax, Abhay.
I'm not jealous.

561
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:17,512
You know what.

562
00:39:18,019 --> 00:39:21,182
I could introduce
you to the Ungli Gang.

563
00:39:21,255 --> 00:39:26,124
Maybe... for my sake...
they'll drop a story or two your way?

564
00:39:26,227 --> 00:39:28,559
I don't need your
introductions or help.

565
00:39:28,629 --> 00:39:29,629
Is that clear?

566
00:39:29,697 --> 00:39:31,392
Okay. Fine!

567
00:39:31,732 --> 00:39:35,759
If you change your mind,
don't hesitate to ask...

568
00:39:43,945 --> 00:39:45,879
Goti, bro...

569
00:39:46,581 --> 00:39:48,310
Mission successful.

570
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:06,660
Hi!

571
00:40:58,886 --> 00:41:00,148
Yes, Gadkari!

572
00:41:00,454 --> 00:41:01,454
He's blind.

573
00:41:02,223 --> 00:41:03,747
But you don't worry.

574
00:41:04,392 --> 00:41:06,826
He has a license.

575
00:41:07,595 --> 00:41:08,755
From you!

576
00:41:10,731 --> 00:41:17,364
He is capable of driving on the streets,
according to your Transport officers.

577
00:41:19,373 --> 00:41:20,067
But!

578
00:41:20,174 --> 00:41:23,041
You left out the most important
part before giving him the license.

579
00:41:23,945 --> 00:41:25,003
What?

580
00:41:25,546 --> 00:41:27,173
Test drive!

581
00:41:27,848 --> 00:41:30,214
But we can fix that.

582
00:41:31,319 --> 00:41:33,549
Yadav is going to
take you on a test drive.

583
00:41:33,621 --> 00:41:34,952
Yes, sir!

584
00:41:35,423 --> 00:41:36,423
Here are the car keys!

585
00:41:36,424 --> 00:41:38,551
One minute, sir.
Let me keep my cane away.

586
00:41:40,561 --> 00:41:41,561
Relax.

587
00:41:44,131 --> 00:41:45,131
Higher!

588
00:41:45,633 --> 00:41:47,225
To the left!

589
00:41:47,435 --> 00:41:48,959
A little lower!

590
00:41:50,037 --> 00:41:51,197
Flash some light!

591
00:41:51,305 --> 00:41:52,305
Light?!

592
00:41:52,373 --> 00:41:53,373
Idiot!

593
00:41:53,474 --> 00:41:55,101
You can't see!
He can't see?!

594
00:41:55,443 --> 00:41:56,535
Sorry.

595
00:41:57,211 --> 00:41:58,542
Drive, drive!

596
00:42:00,748 --> 00:42:01,840
Sorry, sir!

597
00:42:01,916 --> 00:42:03,008
Sorry, sir!

598
00:42:03,084 --> 00:42:04,676
It's my first time!

599
00:42:05,086 --> 00:42:06,383
Should I switch on the AC?

600
00:42:08,923 --> 00:42:10,788
Stop! Enough! Switch it off!

601
00:42:10,891 --> 00:42:13,451
What 'ahh'?! Stop it!

602
00:42:31,312 --> 00:42:34,076
Save me, God... Save me!!!

603
00:42:34,582 --> 00:42:35,810
Look in front!

604
00:42:38,753 --> 00:42:40,653
I gave you the license?

605
00:42:40,855 --> 00:42:43,221
Stop the car! Stop the car!

606
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:46,920
NO!!!

607
00:42:47,928 --> 00:42:51,887
Stop the car!

608
00:43:04,145 --> 00:43:05,305
Reverse.

609
00:43:21,929 --> 00:43:23,123
What do I do with
these contact lenses?

610
00:43:23,197 --> 00:43:24,289
You can keep it.

611
00:43:24,565 --> 00:43:26,685
I've been struggling in
the film industry for so long.

612
00:43:26,934 --> 00:43:28,401
No one's ever given me a role.

613
00:43:28,803 --> 00:43:31,499
Tomorrow onwards,
you'll be flooded with offers.

614
00:43:32,039 --> 00:43:34,371
Every news channel
will have your face on it.

615
00:43:34,508 --> 00:43:35,532
Thank you, sir.

616
00:43:35,810 --> 00:43:37,038
Thank you.

617
00:44:08,943 --> 00:44:10,376
Shhh!

618
00:44:11,345 --> 00:44:14,075
I have a gift for you from Abhay!

619
00:44:15,349 --> 00:44:18,512
I'm going to take
my hand off your mouth.

620
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:20,651
Don't scream.

621
00:44:20,955 --> 00:44:22,286
Okay?

622
00:44:29,263 --> 00:44:30,560
Enjoy the CD!

623
00:44:31,432 --> 00:44:33,627
And don't forget to thank Abhay.

624
00:44:48,115 --> 00:44:49,446
In today's breaking news...

625
00:44:49,517 --> 00:44:53,851
...the Ungli gang's latest
stunt has shaken up the country...

626
00:44:53,954 --> 00:44:56,013
...by exposing the
partnership between...

627
00:44:56,090 --> 00:45:00,220
...Transport officials and
driving school in License corruption.

628
00:45:00,327 --> 00:45:04,161
By using a blind man,
they've opened our eyes.

629
00:45:04,231 --> 00:45:10,033
The illegal license issued,
endangers the lives of citizens.

630
00:45:10,571 --> 00:45:14,439
The legal driving age is 18,
to avoid that danger.

631
00:45:14,742 --> 00:45:15,742
Nice!

632
00:45:15,743 --> 00:45:16,903
Thank you!

633
00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:20,545
Wow...

634
00:45:21,348 --> 00:45:22,645
You're rocking!

635
00:45:23,584 --> 00:45:26,178
The biggest breaking news
is that Manav is happy with me.

636
00:45:27,288 --> 00:45:31,884
Someone asked me
to thank you for the CD.

637
00:45:34,829 --> 00:45:36,592
Thank you, Abhay.
It was very sweet of you.

638
00:45:36,697 --> 00:45:41,725
What can I say... It's nice to see
a beautiful face on the morning news.

639
00:45:42,736 --> 00:45:47,730
Well... if you're not satisfied
with just looking at the face on TV...

640
00:45:48,342 --> 00:45:50,742
...then maybe you can look
at it in a coffee shop after work?

641
00:45:51,212 --> 00:45:52,236
Really?

642
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:54,177
Really.

643
00:45:56,684 --> 00:45:58,879
- You're not as bad as I thought.

644
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:01,087
I can be very judgmental sometimes.

645
00:46:01,956 --> 00:46:05,221
Did your Ungli gang member
ask you to apologize, too?

646
00:46:06,126 --> 00:46:07,354
Shut up!

647
00:46:25,346 --> 00:46:27,075
How did you know I would come?

648
00:46:27,848 --> 00:46:29,440
I've known you since you were a kid.

649
00:46:30,951 --> 00:46:33,112
You always liked free things...

650
00:46:33,654 --> 00:46:35,815
...whether that's a lollipop...
or whiskey.

651
00:46:37,625 --> 00:46:39,320
I've also known you since childhood.

652
00:46:41,228 --> 00:46:46,097
This free whiskey
could really cost me.

653
00:46:47,601 --> 00:46:50,502
What happened of your
college hostel girlfriend?

654
00:46:51,539 --> 00:46:53,507
We broke up six months ago.

655
00:46:54,141 --> 00:46:55,301
Then that night?

656
00:46:55,709 --> 00:46:58,143
I'd gone to give her something
I'd forgotten to give.

657
00:46:58,479 --> 00:46:59,503
What?

658
00:47:01,515 --> 00:47:02,812
Goodbye kiss.

659
00:47:04,385 --> 00:47:09,413
This badboy image of yours
can fool others... but not me.

660
00:47:09,990 --> 00:47:11,685
There's still some good in you.

661
00:47:11,892 --> 00:47:13,052
Wow!

662
00:47:13,727 --> 00:47:15,160
I knew there were
X rays for your body...

663
00:47:15,229 --> 00:47:17,026
...but you can X
ray even my character!

664
00:47:17,531 --> 00:47:18,793
Very good.

665
00:47:19,833 --> 00:47:22,495
What do you think of this Ungli gang?

666
00:47:23,938 --> 00:47:25,132
Let's see.

667
00:47:25,806 --> 00:47:27,171
I'm jealous of them.

668
00:47:27,741 --> 00:47:30,574
We've been called to sing
at the party, but can't sing.

669
00:47:31,245 --> 00:47:33,873
We're the police and we
get no credit for doing our job.

670
00:47:34,248 --> 00:47:36,682
No one can do our job besides us.

671
00:47:38,218 --> 00:47:40,778
Lazy and ineffective people
have no right to anything.

672
00:47:41,889 --> 00:47:44,949
The laziest person in the
world is imparting wisdom to me.

673
00:47:45,693 --> 00:47:49,060
Sitting in a bar,
drinking free whiskey is of no use.

674
00:47:49,563 --> 00:47:52,361
If you want work, I'll give you work.

675
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:54,827
And that is to catch the Ungli gang.

676
00:47:55,302 --> 00:47:57,293
You've been kicked off the bomb squad.

677
00:47:57,404 --> 00:48:00,339
Join me and you'll
report only to me, Nikhil.

678
00:48:02,943 --> 00:48:04,740
Why are you doing me this courtesy?

679
00:48:05,579 --> 00:48:09,982
You don't look it but
you're just like them.

680
00:48:13,053 --> 00:48:14,350
I was right.

681
00:48:14,855 --> 00:48:16,152
About what?

682
00:48:17,091 --> 00:48:20,527
This whiskey really did cost me.

683
00:48:28,869 --> 00:48:30,302
- Have you thought of a plan?

684
00:48:30,404 --> 00:48:31,928
- The plan is exactly like theirs.

685
00:48:32,373 --> 00:48:36,002
We have to find something
that's bothering the public.

686
00:48:36,977 --> 00:48:40,242
Like these sidewalks...
and their potholes.

687
00:48:41,281 --> 00:48:45,047
The Municipal Corporation has dug up
wherever and whatever they wanted to.

688
00:48:45,486 --> 00:48:46,953
Except for the sidewalk...

689
00:48:47,454 --> 00:48:51,015
...in front of the Municipal
Commissioner Pradhan's house.

690
00:48:51,091 --> 00:48:55,187
Which, incidentally, he fixed up
last week... with the public's money.

691
00:48:55,896 --> 00:48:58,922
And all for his son's
wedding in 3 days.

692
00:48:59,667 --> 00:49:01,225
What exactly do you want to do?

693
00:49:02,369 --> 00:49:04,894
Just... want to greet
the wedding guests...

694
00:49:04,972 --> 00:49:07,532
...with something
other than refreshments.

695
00:49:07,975 --> 00:49:11,274
Just give me 3 months, an allowance...

696
00:49:11,545 --> 00:49:16,244
...admission in University
and the freedom to my job, my way.

697
00:49:16,917 --> 00:49:20,819
This information should
only stay between us.

698
00:49:22,256 --> 00:49:23,655
What information, sir?

699
00:50:41,068 --> 00:50:42,365
- Good Morning and welcome!

700
00:50:42,803 --> 00:50:46,603
- The Ungli Gang presents an
explosive wedding video just for you.

701
00:50:46,807 --> 00:50:49,469
This video has music,
playing and wedding guests.

702
00:50:49,843 --> 00:50:50,969
We played the music.

703
00:50:51,178 --> 00:50:54,079
Mr. Pradhan, our Municipal
Commissioner, is the one who got played.

704
00:50:54,314 --> 00:50:55,747
And you all are the wedding guests.

705
00:50:56,450 --> 00:50:59,510
But don't worry about giving
the bride and groom a gift.

706
00:50:59,987 --> 00:51:01,352
You've seen the gift...

707
00:51:01,688 --> 00:51:04,851
...the potholes in front of
Mr. Pradhan's house...

708
00:51:05,492 --> 00:51:10,486
...which the Municipal Corporation
had fixed with your hard earned money.

709
00:51:12,699 --> 00:51:15,031
Perhaps Mr. Pradhan
will now realize...

710
00:51:15,369 --> 00:51:20,238
...he who dig holes for others,
often falls into it himself.

711
00:51:22,242 --> 00:51:26,406
The Municipal Corporation
fill their pockets than the potholes.

712
00:51:26,647 --> 00:51:31,243
It's his son's wedding and
we're paying to fix his sidewalk?!

713
00:51:32,085 --> 00:51:34,610
Ungli Gang, we love you!!!

714
00:51:45,632 --> 00:51:46,530
Hello?

715
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:47,897
How'd you like the explosion?

716
00:51:48,168 --> 00:51:51,262
You're creating explosions there,
and we're feeling the tremors here.

717
00:51:51,572 --> 00:51:52,869
Are you crazy?

718
00:51:53,140 --> 00:51:56,109
It's not like you've
hired me to sing prayers, sir.

719
00:51:57,611 --> 00:52:00,307
I've been getting
the hiccups all day...

720
00:52:01,748 --> 00:52:05,115
Somewhere in this city,
the Ungli gang is thinking about me.

721
00:52:11,225 --> 00:52:14,092
- Dear Ungli Gang, here is an
explosive wedding video just for you.

722
00:52:14,294 --> 00:52:17,229
- This video has music,
playing and wedding guests.

723
00:52:17,297 --> 00:52:18,321
- I played the music...

724
00:52:18,398 --> 00:52:21,663
This scoundrel is using
our name and taking the credit!

725
00:52:22,002 --> 00:52:23,799
It's not cool!

726
00:52:25,772 --> 00:52:27,501
Whoever he is, he's very intelligent.

727
00:52:28,242 --> 00:52:30,870
Question is, why is he doing this?!

728
00:52:31,411 --> 00:52:33,003
To be famous, why else?!

729
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:34,804
No!

730
00:52:34,982 --> 00:52:37,382
This isn't going
to benefit him at all!

731
00:52:37,451 --> 00:52:39,180
He's using the Ungli Gang's name!

732
00:52:39,253 --> 00:52:40,948
We're the ones getting the credit!

733
00:52:41,154 --> 00:52:45,921
...those who dig holes for others,
often fall into it himself.

734
00:52:49,096 --> 00:52:52,122
He's even been smart
about his imitation!

735
00:52:52,566 --> 00:52:54,431
Hey, guys... come check this out.

736
00:52:54,501 --> 00:52:55,593
Come, come...

737
00:52:58,472 --> 00:52:59,769
Watch carefully.

738
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:02,741
The graffiti on the
wall is exactly like ours.

739
00:53:02,910 --> 00:53:06,038
But if you zoom in...
there's something written there.

740
00:53:07,047 --> 00:53:08,344
11...

741
00:53:08,615 --> 00:53:09,707
Do Tanki, C.S. T.

742
00:53:09,816 --> 00:53:11,716
11 pm, Wednesday.

743
00:53:13,553 --> 00:53:16,044
This is an address...
near C. S. T Station.

744
00:53:34,741 --> 00:53:35,537
Yeah, Goti.

745
00:53:35,642 --> 00:53:39,237
- He's been waiting for two hours...
he still isn't tired.

746
00:53:39,346 --> 00:53:42,474
He has to tire
eventually and come down.

747
00:53:52,359 --> 00:53:53,758
Okay, he's coming down.

748
00:54:10,544 --> 00:54:13,172
I knew you'll would come to meet me.

749
00:54:14,047 --> 00:54:15,412
Who are you?

750
00:54:16,183 --> 00:54:18,344
I'm a fan of yours.

751
00:54:19,052 --> 00:54:21,213
What you'll are doing is correct.

752
00:54:21,521 --> 00:54:23,421
I want to join your gang.

753
00:54:24,458 --> 00:54:27,222
You think this a club that
we can give you membership to?

754
00:54:27,327 --> 00:54:28,817
Come on, guys!

755
00:54:29,229 --> 00:54:32,289
You'll saw how I taught
BK Pradhan a lesson, right?!!

756
00:54:33,133 --> 00:54:35,829
I gave such an audition
for your gang...

757
00:54:35,936 --> 00:54:39,133
...that the audience would
immediately know it's you!

758
00:54:39,806 --> 00:54:41,034
Yes...

759
00:54:42,442 --> 00:54:45,206
...but we don't need a new partner.

760
00:54:47,748 --> 00:54:52,048
Look, I know it's not
easy to just trust me.

761
00:54:53,020 --> 00:54:54,612
My name is Nikhil Abhyankar.

762
00:54:54,821 --> 00:54:57,517
I'm a law student
at the Mumbai University.

763
00:54:57,924 --> 00:55:00,791
And I want to join your
fight against corruption.

764
00:55:01,094 --> 00:55:04,359
Finally there's someone
who's fighting the system!

765
00:55:04,431 --> 00:55:05,898
And is winning!

766
00:55:06,166 --> 00:55:08,134
Nice speech.

767
00:55:08,301 --> 00:55:11,361
But the answer is still no.

768
00:55:12,439 --> 00:55:14,168
Then why did you come here?

769
00:55:15,809 --> 00:55:17,674
To give you a warning.

770
00:55:18,311 --> 00:55:20,040
Go study law quietly.

771
00:55:20,113 --> 00:55:23,014
Don't try to take the
law in your hands like us.

772
00:55:42,035 --> 00:55:43,161
Andheri?

773
00:55:43,270 --> 00:55:44,870
Where do you need to go?
- Andheri, west?

774
00:55:44,905 --> 00:55:47,271
It's too nearby.
Long fares only.

775
00:55:50,544 --> 00:55:52,603
Andheri, sir?

776
00:55:58,685 --> 00:56:00,152
Andheri?

777
00:56:00,220 --> 00:56:02,347
Where in Andheri?
- Andheri, west.

778
00:56:03,323 --> 00:56:04,984
Too close by, madam.

779
00:56:05,559 --> 00:56:08,392
Please, sir. Look at how
much stuff I have to carry.

780
00:56:08,528 --> 00:56:09,392
Please?

781
00:56:09,463 --> 00:56:10,896
It'll cost you double the fare.

782
00:56:11,798 --> 00:56:12,992
Why double fare?

783
00:56:13,066 --> 00:56:15,796
That's how much it costs...
If you want to go, let me know.

784
00:56:15,902 --> 00:56:17,460
Or find someone else.

785
00:56:21,007 --> 00:56:22,599
Okay, come.

786
00:56:25,445 --> 00:56:29,347
Mom, what are you doing?

787
00:56:30,016 --> 00:56:32,075
Get down.
- There you are.

788
00:56:32,185 --> 00:56:33,209
Good.

789
00:56:33,286 --> 00:56:34,651
You do this.

790
00:56:34,721 --> 00:56:36,814
My feet are paining.

791
00:56:38,825 --> 00:56:39,883
What happened?

792
00:56:41,128 --> 00:56:42,288
I'm getting old!

793
00:56:43,563 --> 00:56:47,226
Not to mention, I was looking
for a rickshaw all evening.

794
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:50,460
I had to wait for an hour!
You should have called me!

795
00:56:50,804 --> 00:56:52,669
I would have picked
you up on the bike!

796
00:56:52,772 --> 00:56:56,003
No, no.
Why should I disturb you at work?

797
00:56:57,077 --> 00:57:01,377
Nikhil... something needs to be done
about these bully rickshaw drivers.

798
00:57:01,548 --> 00:57:03,812
They're only interested in long fares.

799
00:57:03,950 --> 00:57:06,350
Don't care about senior citizens.

800
00:57:06,653 --> 00:57:10,316
But, Nikhil, today I have noted
down the number of this rickshaw.

801
00:57:10,824 --> 00:57:12,344
Where did you take this rickshaw from?

802
00:57:18,265 --> 00:57:19,459
Where do you want to go?

803
00:57:19,566 --> 00:57:20,566
Andheri.

804
00:57:20,700 --> 00:57:21,700
Not Andheri, sir.

805
00:57:21,768 --> 00:57:23,099
Only long fares.

806
00:57:24,971 --> 00:57:26,666
What the hell are you doing?!

807
00:57:26,973 --> 00:57:28,907
Will you go to Delhi?
- What?

808
00:57:29,910 --> 00:57:31,104
- Drive quietly.

809
00:57:31,178 --> 00:57:32,873
- Or else you'll reach
heaven before Delhi.

810
00:57:33,013 --> 00:57:34,013
Start.

811
00:57:37,651 --> 00:57:40,313
It was a mistake, sir... Forgive me!

812
00:57:40,587 --> 00:57:41,485
Keep going.

813
00:57:41,555 --> 00:57:44,649
Yes... Please forgive me.

814
00:57:44,724 --> 00:57:46,316
Look ahead!

815
00:57:46,393 --> 00:57:47,917
- Forgive me, sir.

816
00:57:48,662 --> 00:57:50,755
- It was a mistake, sir.
Forgive me!

817
00:57:50,864 --> 00:57:52,456
- Turn and stop here.

818
00:57:52,966 --> 00:57:54,729
- Stop here.

819
00:57:57,971 --> 00:57:59,563
- Open that door.

820
00:58:00,941 --> 00:58:02,169
- Open it!

821
00:58:04,878 --> 00:58:06,539
- Take this rickshaw inside.

822
00:58:06,646 --> 00:58:09,012
Sir, please...
- Sit.

823
00:58:10,684 --> 00:58:12,584
Let me go, sir...

824
00:58:16,223 --> 00:58:18,384
Sir, please, sir...

825
00:58:18,592 --> 00:58:21,254
Sir, let me go...

826
00:58:25,765 --> 00:58:27,733
Only long fares, right?!

827
00:58:29,169 --> 00:58:31,660
Here's a long fare.
Go to Delhi!

828
00:58:51,891 --> 00:58:53,085
- Ghanshyam Tiwari.

829
00:58:53,193 --> 00:58:54,057
That rickshaw driver...

830
00:58:54,127 --> 00:58:57,187
...who was sent by the Ungli
gang to Delhi for a 'long fare'.

831
00:58:57,264 --> 00:59:02,167
He was found with his autorickshaw
on a Delhi-Mumbai goods' train.

832
00:59:02,802 --> 00:59:05,066
This driver only went as far as Delhi.

833
00:59:05,138 --> 00:59:08,335
If the autorickshaw drivers
don't stop harassing the common man...

834
00:59:08,441 --> 00:59:10,636
...and don't stop being
greedy for long fares...

835
00:59:10,977 --> 00:59:17,712
...next time we'll send them
a lot further than Delhi!

836
00:59:18,752 --> 00:59:21,983
The Ungli gang has done
the Traffic Police's job.

837
00:59:22,055 --> 00:59:24,387
Hope these rickshaw
guys learn their lesson.

838
00:59:24,457 --> 00:59:28,757
They act like doing their
job is a favour to the citizens.

839
00:59:28,828 --> 00:59:30,853
It's a good lesson
for rickshaw drivers.

840
00:59:30,930 --> 00:59:32,625
They have no manners.

841
00:59:32,732 --> 00:59:34,757
The Ungli Gang has given
them such a long fare...

842
00:59:34,868 --> 00:59:37,428
...that the next time they ask for
one... they'll rethink it 10 times.

843
00:59:37,504 --> 00:59:40,769
We autorickshaw drivers
will not be secure...

844
00:59:40,974 --> 00:59:45,468
...until the culprits are caught!

845
00:59:46,112 --> 00:59:48,137
This guy wants to meet us again.

846
00:59:48,548 --> 00:59:49,810
Monday.

847
00:59:50,317 --> 00:59:52,911
Same time, same place.

848
00:59:55,755 --> 00:59:58,053
Doesn't seem like he's going to stop.

849
00:59:58,458 --> 01:00:02,417
Have to admit...
he has a really wicked mind.

850
01:00:02,529 --> 01:00:03,393
Truly.

851
01:00:03,463 --> 01:00:06,125
Sending the rickshaw driver
with his rickshaw to Delhi...

852
01:00:06,666 --> 01:00:08,258
What a badass thing to do.

853
01:00:08,401 --> 01:00:10,961
Until yesterday, he was our fan...

854
01:00:11,304 --> 01:00:13,932
...now it seems like
you'll are his fans.

855
01:00:14,007 --> 01:00:15,634
Next you'll say he should
be a part of our group.

856
01:00:15,742 --> 01:00:18,506
What's your problem, Abhay?
Why are you so scared?

857
01:00:18,745 --> 01:00:21,805
Do you think someone new will
endanger your importance in the team?

858
01:00:22,148 --> 01:00:24,116
This is your insecurity!

859
01:00:25,251 --> 01:00:27,515
I'm not talking about my insecurity.

860
01:00:28,054 --> 01:00:30,022
I'm talking about
the security of us all.

861
01:00:30,156 --> 01:00:32,590
What Nikhil said that night is true.

862
01:00:32,726 --> 01:00:34,353
This isn't our fight alone.

863
01:00:34,427 --> 01:00:35,724
So, what do you want?

864
01:00:38,431 --> 01:00:40,456
- Whatever.
- What do you mean whatever?

865
01:00:41,401 --> 01:00:43,665
We should give him a chance.

866
01:00:51,177 --> 01:00:52,177
Fine.

867
01:00:52,712 --> 01:00:57,376
But let's find out if Mumbai University
student Nikhil Abhyankar is...

868
01:00:57,684 --> 01:00:59,743
...a soldier or a problem.

869
01:01:21,908 --> 01:01:25,537
- Seems that whatever
Mr. Nikhil Abhyankar said is true.

870
01:01:25,945 --> 01:01:27,936
So. Do you want to meet him?

871
01:01:36,523 --> 01:01:40,220
- Despite our warnings,
you didn't change...

872
01:01:40,994 --> 01:01:43,690
People who try to change me,
usually end up changing themselves.

873
01:01:47,066 --> 01:01:48,590
This isn't a game.

874
01:01:48,902 --> 01:01:50,233
If you get caught, you'll go to jail.

875
01:01:50,336 --> 01:01:54,136
Gandhi didn't wait to claim salt.

876
01:01:55,341 --> 01:01:57,309
Only difference is... he used peace.

877
01:01:57,410 --> 01:01:58,707
We use force.

878
01:01:59,212 --> 01:02:02,010
I've never met anyone
as crazy or stubborn as you.

879
01:02:02,782 --> 01:02:05,512
Just think that
I'm a shadow of you'll.

880
01:02:09,656 --> 01:02:11,920
Remember one thing.

881
01:02:12,926 --> 01:02:15,121
If you betray us...

882
01:02:16,963 --> 01:02:18,590
...I'll kill you.

883
01:02:18,698 --> 01:02:20,018
I won't give you the opportunity.

884
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:21,731
I like living.

885
01:02:25,472 --> 01:02:27,167
Welcome to the gang.

886
01:02:28,708 --> 01:02:31,142
The official Ungli gang.

887
01:02:31,778 --> 01:02:35,874
Kalim, Goti, Maya...

888
01:02:37,951 --> 01:02:39,509
Abhay.

889
01:02:40,653 --> 01:02:42,052
There's another...

890
01:02:42,789 --> 01:02:45,053
...who isn't with us today.

891
01:03:03,643 --> 01:03:04,701
Nikhil...

892
01:03:07,046 --> 01:03:08,172
...meet Ricky.

893
01:03:15,321 --> 01:03:18,848
Ricky is Maya's older brother.

894
01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:23,788
We first met him at his gym.

895
01:03:28,701 --> 01:03:33,070
- He used to make us do
these strange, scary exercises.

896
01:03:34,007 --> 01:03:35,599
Crossfit.

897
01:03:53,226 --> 01:03:54,454
- He's a wonderful guy...

898
01:03:54,694 --> 01:03:57,686
...but super strict
when it came to exercise.

899
01:03:57,864 --> 01:04:00,856
- He wouldn't let us go
until someone vomited.

900
01:04:25,658 --> 01:04:30,527
- As we built our bodies...
we formed a friendship.

901
01:04:34,267 --> 01:04:35,825
If I tried to bunk...

902
01:04:36,002 --> 01:04:41,304
...he would come home and
drag me out of bed to go workout.

903
01:04:41,908 --> 01:04:43,705
He, himself,
used to sleep like the dead.

904
01:04:44,711 --> 01:04:46,372
Even on Brother's Day.

905
01:04:46,646 --> 01:04:48,204
- Wake up!

906
01:04:48,548 --> 01:04:50,038
- How much can you sleep?

907
01:04:50,717 --> 01:04:51,911
Come on, I want my gift.

908
01:04:52,018 --> 01:04:54,486
Letting you celebrate Brother's Day
is my gift to you.

909
01:04:55,722 --> 01:04:56,722
Give me my gift.

910
01:04:56,723 --> 01:04:59,021
Give it or else
I'll take it from your wallet!

911
01:05:01,094 --> 01:05:02,959
Then the incident happened...

912
01:05:03,730 --> 01:05:06,290
...which caused Ricky
to fall into a slumber so deep...

913
01:05:07,166 --> 01:05:09,896
...that he still hasn't woken up.

914
01:05:10,269 --> 01:05:11,964
- Can't you understand?

915
01:05:12,238 --> 01:05:13,796
- Can't you see?

916
01:05:13,906 --> 01:05:15,100
Didn't you see the car?

917
01:05:15,308 --> 01:05:17,776
I've been honking for such
a long time, you couldn't see the car?

918
01:05:17,844 --> 01:05:18,401
Look...

919
01:05:18,478 --> 01:05:19,672
Listen, old man!

920
01:05:19,779 --> 01:05:21,713
I will turn you into a
piece of garbage like your car.

921
01:05:21,814 --> 01:05:23,008
What?!

922
01:05:23,116 --> 01:05:25,236
You overtake from the wrong
side and then make noise?!

923
01:05:25,318 --> 01:05:28,549
Won't take me too long to mess you up,
do you understand?!

924
01:05:28,655 --> 01:05:30,646
Stop, stop, stop...

925
01:05:31,190 --> 01:05:33,030
Aren't you ashamed to
be harassing an old man?!

926
01:05:33,092 --> 01:05:34,855
What, man?
Is he your father or something?!

927
01:05:34,927 --> 01:05:35,723
Leave it now, come on!

928
01:05:35,862 --> 01:05:38,057
Get out of here,
or I'll smash your face.

929
01:05:39,365 --> 01:05:40,730
Aye, boss!

930
01:05:42,468 --> 01:05:43,628
He'll kill you!

931
01:05:43,736 --> 01:05:45,897
You want to create trouble?

932
01:05:50,109 --> 01:05:51,309
You've come to get a beating?!

933
01:05:54,947 --> 01:05:55,845
Come on, come on, come on!

934
01:05:55,982 --> 01:05:57,108
Let's go!

935
01:05:58,151 --> 01:05:59,675
What are you just standing there for?!

936
01:05:59,752 --> 01:06:00,616
- Help him!

937
01:06:00,687 --> 01:06:02,314
- No, sir! This is a police case!

938
01:06:02,388 --> 01:06:03,912
- Help me!

939
01:06:04,357 --> 01:06:05,984
- I'll take him to the hospital!

940
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:08,454
Doctor!

941
01:06:08,561 --> 01:06:09,619
How's Ricky?!

942
01:06:09,896 --> 01:06:11,022
I'm sorry.

943
01:06:11,531 --> 01:06:14,762
He has massive head injuries
and internal hemorrhaging.

944
01:06:14,901 --> 01:06:16,300
He's in a coma.

945
01:06:25,712 --> 01:06:28,476
- It's difficult to predict
anything in coma patients.

946
01:06:28,648 --> 01:06:31,617
- He could wake up tomorrow...
or take years.

947
01:06:32,051 --> 01:06:34,747
But everything happened
before my eyes.

948
01:06:34,854 --> 01:06:36,845
Sir, they hit him with a cricket bat.

949
01:06:36,923 --> 01:06:38,288
He's suffered life
a life threatening attack.

950
01:06:38,357 --> 01:06:39,881
How can you not file an FIR?!

951
01:06:39,992 --> 01:06:42,051
We have the car number.

952
01:06:42,128 --> 01:06:45,894
I told you already!
I don't want to file your FIR.

953
01:06:45,965 --> 01:06:47,523
Don't irritate me unnecessarily.

954
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:48,828
Get out!

955
01:06:50,002 --> 01:06:53,631
When they found out
I was a journalist, they agreed.

956
01:06:53,973 --> 01:06:55,406
Every citizen has the
right to file a complain.

957
01:06:55,475 --> 01:06:58,273
I'll put you all on
the front page if you don't!

958
01:07:08,387 --> 01:07:12,084
Then we found out,
Anshuman Dayal, who hit Ricky...

959
01:07:12,191 --> 01:07:16,685
...his father, BR Dayal,
was well known in the police department.

960
01:07:17,363 --> 01:07:19,695
He was a bookie for
the whole police force.

961
01:07:29,575 --> 01:07:30,303
Hello?

962
01:07:30,376 --> 01:07:34,540
Mr. Joshi, why are you
trying to be a hero at this age?

963
01:07:34,647 --> 01:07:37,810
Enjoy the few years you have left...

964
01:07:37,950 --> 01:07:39,577
Take the case back.
- Who is this?

965
01:07:39,685 --> 01:07:41,585
I'm going to report you to the police.

966
01:07:41,687 --> 01:07:45,054
Mr. Joshi... you don't understand.

967
01:07:45,591 --> 01:07:47,252
This is the police.

968
01:07:48,094 --> 01:07:50,392
If you value your wellbeing
then take this case-

969
01:07:53,566 --> 01:07:54,863
Who was that, Grandpa?

970
01:07:54,934 --> 01:07:56,595
No one, dear.

971
01:07:56,969 --> 01:07:58,459
You go to college.

972
01:07:59,105 --> 01:08:00,504
Bye, Grandpa!

973
01:08:04,510 --> 01:08:06,205
Let's meet his grand daughter...

974
01:08:13,519 --> 01:08:15,043
It was juice this time.

975
01:08:15,154 --> 01:08:17,714
Next time, it'll be acid.
Tell your grandfather!

976
01:08:17,824 --> 01:08:18,620
Understood?!

977
01:08:18,724 --> 01:08:19,986
Let's go.

978
01:08:24,797 --> 01:08:28,198
Mr. Joshi, is my client...

979
01:08:28,835 --> 01:08:31,963
...Mr. Anshuman Dayal,
the one who hit Ricky?

980
01:08:36,175 --> 01:08:37,175
No.

981
01:08:38,377 --> 01:08:40,174
- I don't remember.

982
01:08:41,581 --> 01:08:43,446
- It was dark...

983
01:08:44,050 --> 01:08:45,984
I couldn't see him properly.

984
01:08:46,152 --> 01:08:49,588
Your Honour, Mr. Joshi has
given a statement to the police.

985
01:08:50,256 --> 01:08:53,521
I think someone is threatening him.

986
01:08:55,361 --> 01:08:56,361
No.

987
01:08:57,630 --> 01:09:00,724
I really don't remember.

988
01:09:03,069 --> 01:09:04,661
I made a mistake.

989
01:09:05,771 --> 01:09:07,671
Without him, we can't do anything!

990
01:09:07,940 --> 01:09:09,464
How could he do this to us?

991
01:09:09,775 --> 01:09:12,243
- Until yesterday, he was with us.

992
01:09:15,514 --> 01:09:17,038
Why did you lie?

993
01:09:18,217 --> 01:09:21,675
I can sacrifice my
life for the truth...

994
01:09:22,255 --> 01:09:28,057
...but not that of my
grand daughter and family.

995
01:09:29,061 --> 01:09:33,930
A common man cannot fight
the corrupt system here.

996
01:09:35,668 --> 01:09:37,499
And if they do...

997
01:09:38,938 --> 01:09:40,565
...they cannot win.

998
01:10:09,502 --> 01:10:12,938
I would have smashed that Anshuman's
face if you hadn't stopped me.

999
01:10:13,005 --> 01:10:14,802
And then jail for
the next five years?!

1000
01:10:14,907 --> 01:10:17,705
So what?! Should we sit
here with our hands folded?!

1001
01:10:18,544 --> 01:10:21,775
We should stop Ricky's
life support system.

1002
01:10:23,916 --> 01:10:25,315
You want us to kill Ricky?

1003
01:10:26,185 --> 01:10:28,415
What will keeping him
alive like this achieve?

1004
01:10:30,423 --> 01:10:31,856
Dayal won.

1005
01:10:32,525 --> 01:10:34,425
He lost to the corrupt system.

1006
01:10:35,695 --> 01:10:36,787
Okay.

1007
01:10:38,431 --> 01:10:39,431
Come on.

1008
01:10:39,432 --> 01:10:42,265
Abhay...
- Let's go kill Ricky.

1009
01:10:44,737 --> 01:10:45,737
Come on!

1010
01:10:45,738 --> 01:10:46,738
Let's go!

1011
01:10:49,175 --> 01:10:50,665
Do it.
- Abhay!

1012
01:10:50,776 --> 01:10:51,868
Do it!

1013
01:10:54,714 --> 01:10:56,113
You heard Joshi.

1014
01:10:56,182 --> 01:10:59,174
A common man cannot fight
the corrupt system here.

1015
01:10:59,251 --> 01:11:00,684
He was right.

1016
01:11:00,753 --> 01:11:02,516
Because the common
man has to follow rules.

1017
01:11:02,588 --> 01:11:04,317
He has to stay within the law.

1018
01:11:04,423 --> 01:11:07,392
Those laws and rules that
criminals break whenever they want.

1019
01:11:10,196 --> 01:11:11,720
We'll do the same thing.

1020
01:11:12,198 --> 01:11:13,597
We'll break the law.

1021
01:11:13,733 --> 01:11:15,724
So that these people
learn to respect the law.

1022
01:11:15,801 --> 01:11:17,234
What are you saying?

1023
01:11:17,737 --> 01:11:20,262
You want to us to become
criminals and delinquents?

1024
01:11:20,439 --> 01:11:21,439
No.

1025
01:11:21,907 --> 01:11:23,602
I want us to be gang...

1026
01:11:23,876 --> 01:11:28,540
...of ordinary people who fight
for justice in an extraordinary way.

1027
01:11:29,815 --> 01:11:34,377
Because when the right
and wrong way don't work...

1028
01:11:34,487 --> 01:11:36,819
...you have to take the middle road.

1029
01:11:36,889 --> 01:11:40,552
- It's time we show the
system the middle finger.

1030
01:11:43,429 --> 01:11:45,556
That night, the Ungli gang was formed.

1031
01:11:49,068 --> 01:11:51,468
And thanks to Maya,
you are now one of us.

1032
01:11:52,805 --> 01:11:53,430
Maya?

1033
01:11:53,539 --> 01:11:56,167
Yeah... she was very impressed by you.

1034
01:12:25,438 --> 01:12:28,771
"Oh, my sweet affliction..."

1035
01:12:30,443 --> 01:12:34,277
"My heart melts when I see your eyes."

1036
01:12:34,847 --> 01:12:38,806
"Oh, my sweet affliction..."

1037
01:12:39,852 --> 01:12:43,481
"You've taken over my heart."

1038
01:12:43,956 --> 01:12:47,983
"When you speak."

1039
01:12:48,594 --> 01:12:52,496
"It's like a prayer to me."

1040
01:12:52,898 --> 01:12:57,062
"This love, yours and mine
Is beyond divinity."

1041
01:12:57,570 --> 01:13:02,269
"This love, yours and mine
Is a sweet affliction."

1042
01:13:02,374 --> 01:13:06,572
"This love, yours and mine
Is beyond divinity."

1043
01:13:07,746 --> 01:13:09,839
I can't figure it out.

1044
01:13:10,082 --> 01:13:11,174
What?

1045
01:13:11,617 --> 01:13:13,346
How is Rapunzel still single?

1046
01:13:14,587 --> 01:13:17,886
I guess I still haven't
met my vine-climbing hero.

1047
01:13:20,159 --> 01:13:21,956
Will this Hero Honda riding hero do?

1048
01:13:22,895 --> 01:13:26,524
"Sweet affliction..."

1049
01:13:27,666 --> 01:13:31,158
"Sweet affliction..."

1050
01:13:53,826 --> 01:13:57,318
"Sweet affliction..."

1051
01:14:00,933 --> 01:14:07,361
"Your smile showers
light on the world."

1052
01:14:10,276 --> 01:14:17,011
"And you teach
my soul to be happy."

1053
01:14:18,984 --> 01:14:26,984
"You are my new beginning."

1054
01:14:28,861 --> 01:14:33,025
"And life is nothing
without you."

1055
01:14:34,366 --> 01:14:36,493
Look at what we got.

1056
01:14:37,136 --> 01:14:42,199
Traffic cops accepting
bribes on Kennedy bridge.

1057
01:14:43,742 --> 01:14:46,438
They must make at least
Rs. 3,000 a day.

1058
01:14:46,779 --> 01:14:47,779
Perfect.

1059
01:14:47,780 --> 01:14:48,780
Nikhil.

1060
01:14:50,115 --> 01:14:52,276
You'll be with us on this job.

1061
01:14:54,019 --> 01:14:55,043
Yes, of course.

1062
01:15:10,202 --> 01:15:12,966
Hello?
- Have you got anything on the gang, Nikhil?

1063
01:15:14,173 --> 01:15:14,969
No.

1064
01:15:15,074 --> 01:15:17,406
- I don't think you're
up to doing this job.

1065
01:15:17,943 --> 01:15:19,706
- Come to my office tomorrow morning.

1066
01:15:20,012 --> 01:15:21,843
- The Commissioner has called a meeting.

1067
01:15:28,721 --> 01:15:29,721
- Nikhil?

1068
01:15:29,788 --> 01:15:31,551
Dinner is ready.
Shall I serve?

1069
01:15:31,890 --> 01:15:32,890
Not now, mom.

1070
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:35,686
What's wrong?

1071
01:15:35,961 --> 01:15:37,394
You look upset.

1072
01:15:38,764 --> 01:15:42,325
Mom, if one of dad's
friends broke the law...

1073
01:15:43,802 --> 01:15:45,861
Would he have turned him in?

1074
01:15:46,038 --> 01:15:48,734
He would first try to explain.

1075
01:15:50,542 --> 01:15:53,670
And if he still didn't agree?

1076
01:15:55,681 --> 01:15:57,615
Then he would do his duty.

1077
01:15:58,584 --> 01:16:02,384
He would honour the oath he took
when he joined the police force...

1078
01:16:02,521 --> 01:16:05,354
...more than the friendship.

1079
01:16:16,669 --> 01:16:17,863
Come on!

1080
01:16:23,509 --> 01:16:25,534
Come on, come on, get up, get up...

1081
01:16:25,711 --> 01:16:26,803
Are you okay?

1082
01:16:27,913 --> 01:16:28,607
Shit!

1083
01:16:28,781 --> 01:16:30,248
Carefully...

1084
01:16:32,918 --> 01:16:35,113
It looks like a muscle pull.

1085
01:16:36,188 --> 01:16:37,188
Nothing much.

1086
01:16:37,189 --> 01:16:38,349
You'll be fine.

1087
01:16:38,791 --> 01:16:40,656
You can't come with us today.

1088
01:16:41,727 --> 01:16:42,955
No, I'm coming.

1089
01:16:43,162 --> 01:16:46,256
This is my first job with the gang...
I don't want to miss it.

1090
01:16:46,432 --> 01:16:49,401
If you come on you first
job in this state and get caught...

1091
01:16:49,601 --> 01:16:51,398
...it'll be your last one.

1092
01:16:51,970 --> 01:16:52,970
No.

1093
01:16:53,405 --> 01:16:54,429
No, I'm coming.

1094
01:16:54,807 --> 01:16:55,967
Relax, man.

1095
01:16:56,241 --> 01:16:57,936
It's not like this is our last job.

1096
01:17:00,612 --> 01:17:01,806
There's going to be traffic.

1097
01:17:02,214 --> 01:17:03,738
We should go or we'll be late.

1098
01:17:04,783 --> 01:17:05,545
Let's go.

1099
01:17:05,617 --> 01:17:06,641
Take care.

1100
01:17:07,086 --> 01:17:08,086
You'll be okay, man.

1101
01:17:09,288 --> 01:17:10,288
Come on, Maya.

1102
01:17:29,775 --> 01:17:30,935
Yes, Nikhil.

1103
01:17:31,110 --> 01:17:33,601
Sir, in half an hour
you'll find the Ungli Gang...

1104
01:17:33,679 --> 01:17:36,199
...carrying out their latest
lark in the Mukesh Mills' basement.

1105
01:17:36,482 --> 01:17:37,813
How do you know?

1106
01:17:38,617 --> 01:17:39,948
I'll tell you later, sir.

1107
01:17:40,386 --> 01:17:42,479
You only have half an hour.

1108
01:17:51,263 --> 01:17:53,754
Stop on the side.

1109
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:56,495
Stop on the side.

1110
01:18:00,172 --> 01:18:03,073
He's driving with
a broken number plate.

1111
01:18:03,809 --> 01:18:05,367
Come here, son.

1112
01:18:05,811 --> 01:18:06,811
Come.

1113
01:18:06,812 --> 01:18:07,812
- What happened, sir?

1114
01:18:07,813 --> 01:18:09,178
What do you mean what happened?

1115
01:18:09,248 --> 01:18:11,478
Think you can drive
with a broken number plate?

1116
01:18:11,617 --> 01:18:13,084
Show me your license.

1117
01:18:13,252 --> 01:18:14,651
I made a mistake, sir.
Let me go.

1118
01:18:14,753 --> 01:18:18,348
Okay, you made a mistake.
Now show me your papers.

1119
01:18:18,657 --> 01:18:19,885
Quickly.

1120
01:18:21,026 --> 01:18:22,493
Let's compromise, sir...

1121
01:18:23,195 --> 01:18:23,923
50 bucks?

1122
01:18:24,029 --> 01:18:25,690
Do I look like a beggar?

1123
01:18:26,331 --> 01:18:28,094
You won't get squat for 50 bucks.

1124
01:18:28,667 --> 01:18:29,827
Rs. 200. Come on.

1125
01:18:29,902 --> 01:18:31,164
200?!

1126
01:18:31,437 --> 01:18:32,734
200 is a lot, sir.

1127
01:18:32,971 --> 01:18:34,768
It's a lot, huh? Jeetu!

1128
01:18:35,307 --> 01:18:36,569
Write him a ticket.

1129
01:18:36,809 --> 01:18:39,403
A car that size and
200 is a lot for you?

1130
01:18:39,478 --> 01:18:40,638
Think I'm a fool?

1131
01:18:41,513 --> 01:18:42,639
Okay, fine.

1132
01:18:43,348 --> 01:18:44,838
My friends are in the car.

1133
01:18:45,350 --> 01:18:47,284
I'll try and get it from them.

1134
01:18:47,853 --> 01:18:48,512
Okay, come on!

1135
01:18:48,687 --> 01:18:50,211
Okay, you'll come.

1136
01:18:50,389 --> 01:18:51,287
You, come!

1137
01:18:51,356 --> 01:18:52,687
We have to go there.

1138
01:18:55,761 --> 01:18:57,422
Hey, what are you doing?!

1139
01:19:23,455 --> 01:19:25,320
You'll won't be spared!

1140
01:19:25,457 --> 01:19:26,457
Shut up.

1141
01:19:26,925 --> 01:19:29,393
You cops love the
taste of money, right?

1142
01:19:29,761 --> 01:19:30,761
Here.

1143
01:19:31,230 --> 01:19:32,891
Fill your stomach with this.

1144
01:19:33,532 --> 01:19:37,491
How can we eat these notes?

1145
01:19:37,569 --> 01:19:38,593
Why?

1146
01:19:38,971 --> 01:19:40,370
Isn't this part of your diet?

1147
01:19:41,440 --> 01:19:42,440
Eat.

1148
01:19:44,243 --> 01:19:45,243
Eat.

1149
01:19:47,112 --> 01:19:48,170
Eat!

1150
01:20:17,376 --> 01:20:18,707
Surround the place.

1151
01:20:18,810 --> 01:20:19,930
Cover the entrance and exit.

1152
01:20:19,945 --> 01:20:21,742
The rest of you, come with me.

1153
01:20:27,185 --> 01:20:30,712
Look... please...
we can't digest these notes.

1154
01:20:31,223 --> 01:20:33,316
Try it with pickle.

1155
01:20:35,193 --> 01:20:36,558
Nice and tangy!

1156
01:20:38,163 --> 01:20:40,825
I can't believe you
brought pickle with you!

1157
01:20:41,133 --> 01:20:43,397
- Dude I've even got ketchup in the van.

1158
01:20:51,543 --> 01:20:52,543
Someone's coming.

1159
01:20:52,778 --> 01:20:53,778
The window!

1160
01:21:00,185 --> 01:21:01,675
Look upstairs!

1161
01:21:12,764 --> 01:21:13,764
Look! There he is!

1162
01:21:26,311 --> 01:21:27,335
Catch them.

1163
01:21:39,224 --> 01:21:40,851
Catch them, catch them!

1164
01:21:47,232 --> 01:21:48,563
Behind you!

1165
01:22:26,872 --> 01:22:28,305
Goti, run!

1166
01:22:43,655 --> 01:22:44,655
Nikhil!

1167
01:22:55,233 --> 01:22:56,564
Come on...

1168
01:22:57,536 --> 01:22:59,265
Come on!

1169
01:23:00,639 --> 01:23:02,470
He's not even answering his phone!

1170
01:23:03,041 --> 01:23:05,066
You think he's been
caught by the police?

1171
01:23:05,143 --> 01:23:06,610
Don't say that...

1172
01:23:07,646 --> 01:23:10,410
Goti.
- Shit, he's bleeding!

1173
01:23:12,117 --> 01:23:13,516
Oh, shit man!

1174
01:23:15,687 --> 01:23:17,484
Should we take him to a hospital?

1175
01:23:18,056 --> 01:23:19,648
The bullet's just grazed his arm.

1176
01:23:20,392 --> 01:23:21,689
He's lucky.

1177
01:23:28,066 --> 01:23:29,192
You were with him...

1178
01:23:40,779 --> 01:23:42,303
How come your foot is fine?

1179
01:23:45,817 --> 01:23:48,342
ACP Kale called him by name.

1180
01:23:53,325 --> 01:23:54,792
How does he know your name?

1181
01:23:57,162 --> 01:23:58,424
Nikhil?

1182
01:24:03,235 --> 01:24:04,668
I lied to you'll.

1183
01:24:06,805 --> 01:24:08,466
I'm not a law student.

1184
01:24:10,442 --> 01:24:11,773
I'm a police officer.

1185
01:24:18,383 --> 01:24:20,977
Kale assigned me
to the Ungli gang case.

1186
01:24:22,087 --> 01:24:25,648
This dirtbag has been
fooling us this whole time.

1187
01:24:27,359 --> 01:24:29,384
We trusted you.

1188
01:24:31,163 --> 01:24:33,358
We thought you were our friend.

1189
01:24:36,701 --> 01:24:39,226
This is your idea of friendship?!

1190
01:24:39,304 --> 01:24:40,304
Abhay!

1191
01:24:40,305 --> 01:24:41,431
Abhay!

1192
01:24:44,943 --> 01:24:46,570
What do we do with him now?

1193
01:24:46,812 --> 01:24:48,609
We can't let him go.

1194
01:24:51,216 --> 01:24:54,083
He'll report everything to the police.

1195
01:24:55,554 --> 01:24:57,488
We have only one option.

1196
01:24:57,689 --> 01:24:59,486
We have to finish him.

1197
01:24:59,858 --> 01:25:01,155
Are you insane?

1198
01:25:01,660 --> 01:25:04,288
You want to be a murderer?
- Maya's right, Goti.

1199
01:25:06,932 --> 01:25:08,524
We're not killers.

1200
01:25:10,936 --> 01:25:14,895
Do you guys understand that
his freedom means jail for us all?!

1201
01:25:15,207 --> 01:25:18,768
I'm not going to go to
jail for this scumbag betrayer!

1202
01:25:18,910 --> 01:25:19,569
Kalim!

1203
01:25:19,711 --> 01:25:21,110
I'm going to kill him,
I'm going to finish him!

1204
01:25:21,179 --> 01:25:21,975
Kalim!

1205
01:25:22,080 --> 01:25:24,514
Get out of my way,
I'm going to kill him!

1206
01:25:24,749 --> 01:25:26,842
Move out my way, Abhay!

1207
01:25:26,952 --> 01:25:28,180
Control yourself!

1208
01:25:28,353 --> 01:25:29,479
Stop it!

1209
01:25:30,222 --> 01:25:32,690
Stop it!
- Goti's been shot!

1210
01:25:32,791 --> 01:25:33,485
Stop!

1211
01:25:33,558 --> 01:25:35,116
I can't go to jail for him!

1212
01:25:35,193 --> 01:25:35,887
Stop!

1213
01:25:35,994 --> 01:25:38,656
I can't go to jail for him, man!

1214
01:25:39,998 --> 01:25:42,592
I can't go to jail for him...

1215
01:25:42,834 --> 01:25:44,233
Get out, Nikhil.

1216
01:25:44,803 --> 01:25:46,236
- Go man.

1217
01:25:46,838 --> 01:25:49,898
Before one of us actually kills you.

1218
01:25:51,810 --> 01:25:54,176
- I can't go to jail for him...

1219
01:25:54,880 --> 01:25:55,880
I'm sorry.

1220
01:26:03,388 --> 01:26:09,657
"Hollow eyes."

1221
01:26:13,698 --> 01:26:16,064
"Traces of a lost dream."

1222
01:26:16,167 --> 01:26:20,194
"Like a broken star"

1223
01:26:24,175 --> 01:26:29,169
"The flame of hope,
flickers and fades..."

1224
01:26:29,414 --> 01:26:34,977
"How, then, do we light the way?"

1225
01:26:36,087 --> 01:26:40,547
"Oh, Lord... show me the way."

1226
01:26:41,459 --> 01:26:46,396
"Oh, Lord... show me the way."

1227
01:26:47,299 --> 01:26:49,358
"Pick up this broken man"

1228
01:26:49,434 --> 01:26:51,265
- What happened, Nikhil?

1229
01:26:51,903 --> 01:26:55,930
"Oh, Lord... show me the way."

1230
01:26:57,108 --> 01:27:01,841
"Oh, Lord... show me the way."

1231
01:27:09,988 --> 01:27:14,516
"Oh, Lord... show me the way."

1232
01:27:15,360 --> 01:27:17,658
"Oh, Lord... show me the way."

1233
01:27:17,729 --> 01:27:18,821
Abhay?

1234
01:27:19,898 --> 01:27:21,024
What's wrong?

1235
01:27:23,735 --> 01:27:24,735
Teesta...

1236
01:27:26,838 --> 01:27:28,135
I have to tell you something.

1237
01:27:28,239 --> 01:27:32,539
Something I should
have told you earlier...

1238
01:27:33,445 --> 01:27:34,503
What?

1239
01:27:36,848 --> 01:27:41,876
"Two paths lie before me..."

1240
01:27:41,987 --> 01:27:47,619
"Which one must I take?"

1241
01:27:49,294 --> 01:27:51,489
- What's going on with Kale?

1242
01:27:51,763 --> 01:27:54,323
Why hasn't he caught the Ungli gang yet?

1243
01:27:54,499 --> 01:27:56,330
My phone is ringing off the hook.

1244
01:27:56,401 --> 01:27:57,629
I'll speak to him, sir.

1245
01:27:57,736 --> 01:27:58,736
Hurry up.

1246
01:27:58,737 --> 01:28:01,103
In any case,
it's time for his transfer.

1247
01:28:01,940 --> 01:28:04,306
You know how things
get during this time.

1248
01:28:05,543 --> 01:28:10,606
"Oh, Lord... show me the way."

1249
01:28:18,356 --> 01:28:22,952
- It's my own fault for
thinking you're like your father.

1250
01:28:23,328 --> 01:28:24,852
But the truth is...

1251
01:28:24,929 --> 01:28:29,491
...that you're not worthy of being
his son nor of wearing this uniform.

1252
01:28:29,667 --> 01:28:30,998
What uniform are you talking about?!

1253
01:28:31,069 --> 01:28:34,038
The one they wear to accept
bribes at every traffic signal?

1254
01:28:34,105 --> 01:28:36,972
The one they wear
to ask for money to...

1255
01:28:37,075 --> 01:28:39,737
...ignore cases or extort
money from citizens by threatening...

1256
01:28:39,811 --> 01:28:41,802
...them with false cases?

1257
01:28:42,280 --> 01:28:45,340
Half the police officers
are bursting out of their shirts...

1258
01:28:45,450 --> 01:28:47,577
...because they're stuffed with money.

1259
01:28:47,819 --> 01:28:51,516
Children's dirty nappies
are changed immediately.

1260
01:28:51,656 --> 01:28:54,318
But the system has
been dirty since 1947...

1261
01:28:54,559 --> 01:28:57,926
...and the police's job of changing
it is being done by the Ungli gang!

1262
01:28:58,029 --> 01:28:59,553
What nonsense are you talking, Nikhil?

1263
01:28:59,831 --> 01:29:02,527
The ones you're
praising are criminals.

1264
01:29:03,001 --> 01:29:05,697
And the ones you want to
arrest are now my friends, sir.

1265
01:29:06,738 --> 01:29:08,262
I realized that if they get caught...

1266
01:29:08,373 --> 01:29:10,373
...it's not them but
a hope that will be locked up.

1267
01:29:10,375 --> 01:29:12,275
A hope that every citizen
of this country has.

1268
01:29:12,377 --> 01:29:15,107
That there's finally someone
who's ready to fight the system.

1269
01:29:15,246 --> 01:29:16,246
Without any agenda.

1270
01:29:16,314 --> 01:29:18,475
I want all their names.
Immediately!

1271
01:29:18,583 --> 01:29:19,675
Sorry, sir.

1272
01:29:20,552 --> 01:29:22,611
I can't tell you their names.

1273
01:29:22,687 --> 01:29:25,019
Come to the police station.
I'll make you talk.

1274
01:29:25,123 --> 01:29:26,123
Come on!

1275
01:29:32,197 --> 01:29:33,027
Yes, sir!

1276
01:29:33,098 --> 01:29:36,329
- Kale, leave everything
and come meet me.

1277
01:29:36,534 --> 01:29:37,091
But, sir...

1278
01:29:37,168 --> 01:29:38,168
- Right now, Kale.

1279
01:30:00,959 --> 01:30:02,688
- Will you have a drink, Kale?

1280
01:30:03,061 --> 01:30:04,892
No, sir. I'm driving.

1281
01:30:07,765 --> 01:30:09,562
It's bad news...

1282
01:30:09,868 --> 01:30:10,994
I didn't understand.

1283
01:30:11,102 --> 01:30:12,763
That's why I've called you.

1284
01:30:13,171 --> 01:30:14,468
- To explain.

1285
01:30:16,040 --> 01:30:19,305
- Kale, the order for
your transfer has come.

1286
01:30:20,678 --> 01:30:22,612
Don't look at me like that.

1287
01:30:23,148 --> 01:30:25,639
- They were going to
transfer you to Zone 11.

1288
01:30:25,850 --> 01:30:29,445
You would rot and die there.

1289
01:30:29,687 --> 01:30:31,279
I staked my reputation on you...

1290
01:30:31,356 --> 01:30:34,223
...so the commissioner
agreed to put you somewhere good.

1291
01:30:35,160 --> 01:30:39,256
Sir, if you transfer me,
what will happen to the Ungli gang?

1292
01:30:39,364 --> 01:30:40,922
Don't worry about them.

1293
01:30:41,065 --> 01:30:42,657
Worry about yourself.

1294
01:30:44,335 --> 01:30:48,704
You know you can't get a good
post without bribery these days.

1295
01:30:48,773 --> 01:30:50,104
Isn't that right?

1296
01:30:52,143 --> 01:30:54,839
There's a lot of competition
for the dockyard area.

1297
01:30:55,013 --> 01:30:56,640
Lots of officers want it.

1298
01:30:56,781 --> 01:30:58,908
I'm giving you that.

1299
01:30:58,983 --> 01:31:02,714
Just make sure you give
Rs. 5 lakhs to B. R. Dayal.

1300
01:31:02,987 --> 01:31:04,545
I'll handle the rest.

1301
01:31:04,656 --> 01:31:06,123
B. R. Dayal?

1302
01:31:06,357 --> 01:31:07,688
That fixer?!

1303
01:31:08,793 --> 01:31:12,422
He manages all the illegal
money of the police force.

1304
01:31:12,997 --> 01:31:15,932
In the next few years, you'll
have to pay about 40-50 lakhs more...

1305
01:31:16,034 --> 01:31:17,501
But don't worry.

1306
01:31:17,669 --> 01:31:20,570
You'll be earning so much,
this will seem like nothing.

1307
01:31:20,772 --> 01:31:23,741
Sir, I'm not interested in that...

1308
01:31:23,808 --> 01:31:25,275
...only in law enforcement.

1309
01:31:25,376 --> 01:31:26,866
I know, Kale.

1310
01:31:26,945 --> 01:31:32,577
But if you don't accept,
that's the end of your career.

1311
01:31:35,954 --> 01:31:37,012
Go home.

1312
01:31:37,222 --> 01:31:39,486
And think peacefully about it.

1313
01:31:40,258 --> 01:31:42,055
You have three days.

1314
01:31:42,694 --> 01:31:45,026
And then, even I can't help you.

1315
01:31:46,731 --> 01:31:47,993
- Think about it.

1316
01:31:58,009 --> 01:31:59,476
You were right, Nikhil.

1317
01:32:00,144 --> 01:32:02,772
The men in uniform
are the worst criminals.

1318
01:32:03,248 --> 01:32:05,910
I have no right to arrest you.

1319
01:32:08,620 --> 01:32:11,214
It's all dirty... from head to toe.

1320
01:32:25,270 --> 01:32:28,501
Come on.
Start the bike.

1321
01:32:32,443 --> 01:32:33,933
- I don't get it, man.

1322
01:32:35,179 --> 01:32:37,079
- We were going to stay
away from this place.

1323
01:32:37,315 --> 01:32:38,805
Something's wrong.

1324
01:32:39,417 --> 01:32:41,510
Why did Abhay call us here?

1325
01:32:45,290 --> 01:32:46,416
Abhay!

1326
01:32:47,792 --> 01:32:49,657
You-

1327
01:32:56,034 --> 01:32:58,093
If I wanted to arrest you'll...

1328
01:32:58,269 --> 01:33:00,829
...we would be talking
in the police station.

1329
01:33:00,938 --> 01:33:03,839
Where Kale would beat
a confession out of you'll.

1330
01:33:05,710 --> 01:33:08,736
You must be wondering
why that hasn't happened yet.

1331
01:33:12,250 --> 01:33:13,740
Consider it a kindness from me.

1332
01:33:14,786 --> 01:33:16,811
I haven't told Kale your names.

1333
01:33:18,656 --> 01:33:19,656
Why?

1334
01:33:20,892 --> 01:33:23,122
I thought your goal
was to have us caught.

1335
01:33:23,294 --> 01:33:24,294
It was.

1336
01:33:24,929 --> 01:33:25,929
It was.

1337
01:33:26,898 --> 01:33:28,889
But then I got to know all of you.

1338
01:33:29,334 --> 01:33:31,666
I began to understand the
objective of the Ungli Gang.

1339
01:33:31,869 --> 01:33:36,568
Began to understand how the
injustice dealt to Ricky led...

1340
01:33:37,542 --> 01:33:39,567
...you'll to seek justice.

1341
01:33:40,111 --> 01:33:42,071
Really...
- I started believing in my new friends.

1342
01:33:42,180 --> 01:33:44,705
If you believed in us so much...

1343
01:33:46,584 --> 01:33:49,348
...why did you inform Kale about us?

1344
01:33:51,989 --> 01:33:54,423
My father was a
sincere police officer.

1345
01:33:55,059 --> 01:33:57,323
He gave his life for his duty.

1346
01:33:58,563 --> 01:34:00,895
I put myself in his shoes...

1347
01:34:01,065 --> 01:34:04,831
And as noble as your
intentions were...

1348
01:34:06,070 --> 01:34:09,062
He wouldn't have let you
take the law in your own hands.

1349
01:34:10,641 --> 01:34:14,407
I realized that I am not my father.

1350
01:34:16,280 --> 01:34:18,111
And he may not have been right.

1351
01:34:19,450 --> 01:34:21,941
Why have you come here today?

1352
01:34:23,221 --> 01:34:24,518
I need you'll.

1353
01:34:27,458 --> 01:34:29,449
Because somebody needs you'll.

1354
01:34:30,962 --> 01:34:34,159
They don't need law,
government or the police...

1355
01:34:34,532 --> 01:34:36,363
...only the Ungli gang.

1356
01:34:36,734 --> 01:34:37,928
This is bullshit.

1357
01:34:38,136 --> 01:34:40,570
He's trying to trick us again.
- Wait a minute.

1358
01:34:42,507 --> 01:34:44,532
Say we agree to help you.

1359
01:34:46,010 --> 01:34:47,602
What will we get in return?

1360
01:34:49,347 --> 01:34:51,577
That which made you'll
form the Ungli gang.

1361
01:34:53,351 --> 01:34:54,682
Justice for Ricky.

1362
01:34:56,487 --> 01:34:59,615
Anshuman Dayal and
his father BR Dayal.

1363
01:35:10,301 --> 01:35:11,700
Why have you come here?

1364
01:35:12,236 --> 01:35:13,601
To take you away from here.

1365
01:35:13,871 --> 01:35:15,065
Don't make me hit you.

1366
01:35:15,273 --> 01:35:16,673
I want to explain something to you.

1367
01:35:16,774 --> 01:35:19,299
Nothing gets solved from
sitting and drinking at a bar.

1368
01:35:19,544 --> 01:35:21,784
If you want to do something about it,
I can show you how.

1369
01:35:21,979 --> 01:35:23,879
Remember when I was
the one giving you orders?

1370
01:35:23,981 --> 01:35:24,981
What can I say?

1371
01:35:25,450 --> 01:35:27,941
I can't see a lion cower like this.

1372
01:35:28,653 --> 01:35:31,850
Nikhil, there are less
than 300 lions in India.

1373
01:35:32,223 --> 01:35:34,623
If another one dies...
it makes no difference.

1374
01:35:35,860 --> 01:35:37,157
What do you need?

1375
01:35:38,529 --> 01:35:40,326
Just because you're not
giving Dayal Rs. 5 lakhs...

1376
01:35:40,398 --> 01:35:42,696
...doesn't mean you
spend it all on whiskey.

1377
01:35:42,967 --> 01:35:45,993
Sitting here and crying
will achieve nothing.

1378
01:35:46,704 --> 01:35:48,729
Tears only dilute the whiskey.

1379
01:35:50,074 --> 01:35:51,769
It's not that easy.

1380
01:35:52,510 --> 01:35:53,943
You were right, Nikhil.

1381
01:35:54,612 --> 01:35:58,378
Every police officer's uniform
is tainted with corruption.

1382
01:35:59,116 --> 01:36:03,951
Even DCP Sivaraman, whom I respected.

1383
01:36:04,856 --> 01:36:06,619
It's won't just wash off.

1384
01:36:06,791 --> 01:36:08,816
Who wants to wash it off?

1385
01:36:09,327 --> 01:36:11,192
I want to strip them naked...

1386
01:36:11,662 --> 01:36:13,152
Forget washing.

1387
01:36:13,798 --> 01:36:15,322
And who's going to strip them naked?

1388
01:36:17,201 --> 01:36:18,998
You, me and some of my friends.

1389
01:36:20,204 --> 01:36:22,365
Why would the Ungli gang work with me?

1390
01:36:23,608 --> 01:36:25,337
Because like yours...

1391
01:36:26,477 --> 01:36:28,206
...this is where their heart lies.

1392
01:36:37,455 --> 01:36:38,820
ACP Kale...

1393
01:36:40,358 --> 01:36:41,655
...meet the Ungli Gang.

1394
01:36:41,826 --> 01:36:44,624
Guys, ACP Kale.

1395
01:36:54,739 --> 01:36:56,900
I don't shake hands with criminals.

1396
01:36:59,076 --> 01:37:00,771
We aren't criminals.

1397
01:37:01,779 --> 01:37:03,269
And from what Nikhil says...

1398
01:37:03,381 --> 01:37:05,815
...you need us and we need you.

1399
01:37:06,284 --> 01:37:08,184
That's why we're here.

1400
01:37:11,956 --> 01:37:13,150
What's the plan?

1401
01:37:25,903 --> 01:37:27,700
- Sir, Kale sir is here.

1402
01:37:30,408 --> 01:37:31,408
Bring him in.

1403
01:37:35,513 --> 01:37:36,912
Come, Kale, come.

1404
01:37:37,515 --> 01:37:38,515
- Sit.

1405
01:37:41,686 --> 01:37:43,813
I just suffered a loss of Rs. 10.

1406
01:37:45,489 --> 01:37:48,856
I bet that you wouldn't come.

1407
01:37:49,694 --> 01:37:50,888
This is Rs. 3 lakh.

1408
01:37:51,562 --> 01:37:52,654
Count it.

1409
01:37:54,165 --> 01:37:56,030
Don't embarrass me.

1410
01:37:57,835 --> 01:38:02,067
The world knows there
is no cop as honest as Kale.

1411
01:38:03,608 --> 01:38:07,772
Even when you're being underhanded,
you'll be honest.

1412
01:38:09,914 --> 01:38:13,907
Anyway, what about
the rest of the money?

1413
01:38:15,319 --> 01:38:17,287
Today's the last date.

1414
01:38:18,356 --> 01:38:21,018
Tomorrow seems auspicious
to put the money away.

1415
01:38:22,059 --> 01:38:25,893
It's not easy for me to put
together this much money so quickly.

1416
01:38:26,897 --> 01:38:29,024
I'll send it tonight with my men.

1417
01:38:29,533 --> 01:38:33,367
Then tomorrow morning your post
at the dockyard will be confirmed.

1418
01:38:34,138 --> 01:38:36,197
Earn lots of money.

1419
01:38:36,474 --> 01:38:38,408
Throw a net to catch some cash.

1420
01:38:41,979 --> 01:38:44,106
I know you're new to this.

1421
01:38:44,949 --> 01:38:46,280
But don't worry.

1422
01:38:47,351 --> 01:38:48,943
It's only tough to start with.

1423
01:38:49,020 --> 01:38:51,352
Slowly, you'll get used to it.

1424
01:38:52,957 --> 01:38:54,652
Just think of it like this...

1425
01:38:55,826 --> 01:39:00,991
You're not buying a house;
you're buying a career.

1426
01:39:03,501 --> 01:39:05,093
My son, Anshuman.

1427
01:39:05,469 --> 01:39:07,061
Do namaste to Kale sir.

1428
01:39:07,171 --> 01:39:08,035
Namaste.

1429
01:39:08,105 --> 01:39:08,935
Come, sit.

1430
01:39:09,040 --> 01:39:09,836
No, Dad.

1431
01:39:09,907 --> 01:39:10,999
I gotta go.
I'll see you later.

1432
01:39:11,075 --> 01:39:12,303
Okay.

1433
01:39:13,477 --> 01:39:16,310
Drive carefully.

1434
01:39:16,414 --> 01:39:17,414
- Yes...

1435
01:39:18,115 --> 01:39:19,139
Namaste.

1436
01:39:21,218 --> 01:39:23,345
Take care of this.

1437
01:39:23,487 --> 01:39:25,955
This is between you
and the police force.

1438
01:39:26,290 --> 01:39:28,724
Who am I to come between
such a beautiful relationship?

1439
01:39:30,161 --> 01:39:30,820
Pande!

1440
01:39:30,895 --> 01:39:31,895
Yes, sir.

1441
01:39:32,830 --> 01:39:35,458
Take Kale sir and
have him keep the money inside.

1442
01:39:35,533 --> 01:39:37,501
Go, Kale.

1443
01:39:46,377 --> 01:39:47,377
Come, sir.

1444
01:40:06,530 --> 01:40:08,521
- Thank God he's gone...

1445
01:40:14,071 --> 01:40:15,402
Boys.

1446
01:40:23,114 --> 01:40:24,741
What do you want?

1447
01:40:24,815 --> 01:40:26,282
Kale sir has sent us.

1448
01:40:26,584 --> 01:40:28,142
Let the car in!

1449
01:40:44,769 --> 01:40:45,599
Yes, sir?

1450
01:40:45,703 --> 01:40:46,727
Kale sir's money.

1451
01:40:46,837 --> 01:40:47,837
One minute.

1452
01:40:59,817 --> 01:41:01,614
Hello?
- Sir, Kale sir's men are here.

1453
01:41:01,685 --> 01:41:03,585
Should I throw a welcome party?!

1454
01:41:04,355 --> 01:41:07,324
Take them to the room
and have the money kept.

1455
01:41:07,424 --> 01:41:08,584
Yes, sir.

1456
01:41:09,627 --> 01:41:10,787
Come.

1457
01:41:56,073 --> 01:41:57,335
Hello, sir.

1458
01:41:59,510 --> 01:42:00,510
Who's come?

1459
01:42:00,578 --> 01:42:02,136
Kale's men, sir.

1460
01:42:31,242 --> 01:42:33,210
I've seen you before.

1461
01:42:35,913 --> 01:42:38,040
Have you ever come here before?

1462
01:42:38,916 --> 01:42:40,474
No. First time.

1463
01:42:46,624 --> 01:42:47,648
Okay.

1464
01:43:21,025 --> 01:43:22,185
Teesta Sen?

1465
01:43:22,426 --> 01:43:23,620
ACP Kale.

1466
01:43:24,061 --> 01:43:26,359
Of course, I know you.
But you're here?

1467
01:43:26,664 --> 01:43:29,531
Are you ready for the
biggest story of your life?

1468
01:43:33,037 --> 01:43:34,129
Welcome, everyone.

1469
01:43:34,204 --> 01:43:37,037
In today's breaking news, a story...

1470
01:43:37,107 --> 01:43:41,544
...that will blow the doors wide
open on corruption in this country.

1471
01:43:42,012 --> 01:43:44,310
The criminal is neither
a minister nor a politician...

1472
01:43:44,448 --> 01:43:48,350
The criminals are the same
ones who are meant to stop crime.

1473
01:43:48,452 --> 01:43:49,578
Our Police.

1474
01:43:49,687 --> 01:43:52,747
And the one making this sensational...

1475
01:43:52,823 --> 01:43:57,419
...and shocking accusation
is ACP Ashok Kale.

1476
01:43:57,761 --> 01:44:02,425
Sir, can you tell our viewers
what happened that night?

1477
01:44:05,002 --> 01:44:08,563
For the first time in my career,
I was told...

1478
01:44:08,939 --> 01:44:13,205
...that if I paid, I would
be transferred to a good place.

1479
01:44:13,577 --> 01:44:15,704
Otherwise,
I would be transferred to place...

1480
01:44:15,813 --> 01:44:17,678
...which could be career-ending.

1481
01:44:17,881 --> 01:44:22,318
How much money were you asked to pay?

1482
01:44:23,420 --> 01:44:25,149
Rs. 5 lakh, upfront.

1483
01:44:25,422 --> 01:44:29,358
Above that, 40-50 lakhs to
be paid off in the coming years.

1484
01:44:29,593 --> 01:44:31,390
Who made this offer?

1485
01:44:34,264 --> 01:44:36,095
- My superior officer.

1486
01:44:36,433 --> 01:44:38,230
- DCP Sivaraman.

1487
01:44:39,603 --> 01:44:42,504
- Who collects this
money for the police?

1488
01:44:42,606 --> 01:44:46,667
- BR Dayal who is the
fixer for the police force.

1489
01:44:47,678 --> 01:44:49,111
Bloody swine.

1490
01:44:49,480 --> 01:44:53,644
- This money is distributed
through the police force.

1491
01:44:53,751 --> 01:44:55,082
How high does this go?

1492
01:44:56,220 --> 01:44:58,347
To the Commissioner of police.

1493
01:44:59,256 --> 01:45:03,022
You're making some
serious allegations.

1494
01:45:03,627 --> 01:45:06,790
- Do you have any proof?

1495
01:45:06,897 --> 01:45:08,364
- I do have proof.

1496
01:45:08,799 --> 01:45:10,289
And that evidence...

1497
01:45:10,734 --> 01:45:14,670
...will bring the police force
crashing down like a house of cards.

1498
01:45:17,408 --> 01:45:22,869
The police force's money is kept
under high security in Dayal's house.

1499
01:45:27,985 --> 01:45:31,512
This money is counted
by everyone who gets it.

1500
01:45:38,028 --> 01:45:40,622
This money has been sprayed
with a sulfur solution...

1501
01:45:42,299 --> 01:45:45,735
When this solution comes
in contact with saliva...

1502
01:45:46,070 --> 01:45:49,403
It leaves a black mark on
the tongue of the person counting.

1503
01:46:13,464 --> 01:46:15,796
How long does this mark remain?

1504
01:46:15,866 --> 01:46:17,265
Four days.

1505
01:46:17,434 --> 01:46:19,766
It's next to impossible
to get rid of it.

1506
01:46:20,504 --> 01:46:23,268
It can only be removed with acid.

1507
01:46:23,340 --> 01:46:24,967
And I'm sure...

1508
01:46:25,042 --> 01:46:29,001
...my capable fellow officers
won't wash their tongues with acid.

1509
01:46:45,362 --> 01:46:49,560
So all we have to do is
ask our top police officers...

1510
01:46:49,900 --> 01:46:53,836
"Sir, would you mind
showing us your tongue?"

1511
01:47:04,515 --> 01:47:06,915
Sir, can you show us your tongue?

1512
01:47:09,686 --> 01:47:12,314
Can we see your tongue?

1513
01:47:14,925 --> 01:47:17,018
How much money did you
take to blacken your tongue?

1514
01:47:26,003 --> 01:47:27,732
Open the door, Sivaraman!

1515
01:47:29,439 --> 01:47:30,838
- Sir, we won't leave!

1516
01:47:30,941 --> 01:47:33,102
- Open the door!

1517
01:47:41,285 --> 01:47:43,150
Down with the Commissioner!

1518
01:47:43,320 --> 01:47:46,812
The Chief Minister should resign.

1519
01:47:46,990 --> 01:47:50,585
If the owner is dishonest,
then why won't the dog steal the bone?

1520
01:47:50,694 --> 01:47:52,457
Down with corruption!

1521
01:47:52,563 --> 01:47:54,394
Down with the Mumbai Police!

1522
01:47:54,464 --> 01:47:56,125
The public is furious, Chief Minister.

1523
01:47:57,034 --> 01:47:58,399
This agitation will increase more.

1524
01:47:59,002 --> 01:48:00,002
We need to solve this.

1525
01:48:14,851 --> 01:48:15,851
Ma'am...

1526
01:48:16,119 --> 01:48:17,882
- Could I get an autograph?
- Settle down...

1527
01:48:18,522 --> 01:48:20,046
Settle down...

1528
01:48:20,824 --> 01:48:24,590
To erase the corruption
that's destroying our society...

1529
01:48:25,195 --> 01:48:29,097
...I have decided
to take some severe steps.

1530
01:48:29,800 --> 01:48:33,600
So that the people meant
to protect the people aren't...

1531
01:48:33,670 --> 01:48:35,831
...the ones taking advantage of them.

1532
01:48:37,441 --> 01:48:43,539
Today onwards, ACP Kale will
be relieved from his position.

1533
01:48:46,216 --> 01:48:48,844
From today, he is no longer ACP...

1534
01:48:49,253 --> 01:48:52,882
But Mumbai's new
Commissioner of Police.

1535
01:48:54,992 --> 01:48:57,085
Kale, you rock!

1536
01:48:57,728 --> 01:49:03,667
- So that, we can fight
corruption from the top.

1537
01:49:04,067 --> 01:49:10,302
- I would now like Commissioner Kale
to discuss his plans for the city.

1538
01:49:14,778 --> 01:49:17,110
All I want to say is...

1539
01:49:17,381 --> 01:49:19,372
No one is bigger than the law.

1540
01:49:19,683 --> 01:49:22,174
Even if he is the
protecter of the law.

1541
01:49:22,352 --> 01:49:28,348
Commissioner Kale, how did you carry
out the sting operation on your own?

1542
01:49:28,592 --> 01:49:30,253
The planning and all?

1543
01:49:31,628 --> 01:49:33,118
I wasn't alone.

1544
01:49:33,597 --> 01:49:35,258
My friends helped me.

1545
01:49:57,721 --> 01:49:58,847
- Commissioner Kale...

1546
01:49:59,489 --> 01:50:00,888
Not bad!

1547
01:50:01,625 --> 01:50:04,116
But, why have you called us here?

1548
01:50:04,294 --> 01:50:06,262
To give you all some good news.

1549
01:50:06,430 --> 01:50:09,888
Dayal and his son have been
given a tough and lengthy prison term.

1550
01:50:12,736 --> 01:50:14,431
Justice for Ricky...

1551
01:50:14,504 --> 01:50:16,472
I would like to meet him some time...

1552
01:50:16,640 --> 01:50:21,202
And pay my respects to the man
that the Ungli gang was formed for.

1553
01:50:21,411 --> 01:50:22,878
Of course, sir.

1554
01:50:23,647 --> 01:50:28,311
He would love to meet
the man who helped his friends.

1555
01:50:29,953 --> 01:50:32,683
You don't shake hands
with criminals, so...

1556
01:50:33,523 --> 01:50:34,683
No, I don't.

1557
01:50:39,796 --> 01:50:40,796
Sir...

1558
01:50:41,732 --> 01:50:42,732
Sorry.

1559
01:50:45,936 --> 01:50:47,597
So should I confirm this alliance?

1560
01:50:47,804 --> 01:50:51,069
The uniform looks good on you...
would you like to wear it again?

1561
01:50:53,510 --> 01:50:54,807
I'll think about it.

1562
01:50:54,978 --> 01:50:56,172
Think.

1563
01:50:56,279 --> 01:50:58,304
I'll be waiting for
you at the club tomorrow.

1564
01:50:58,382 --> 01:50:59,872
Let's have a drink.

1565
01:50:59,950 --> 01:51:01,679
You're planning to trap me again?

1566
01:51:01,752 --> 01:51:03,151
Maybe...

1567
01:51:03,387 --> 01:51:07,756
I hope that this city will
no longer need the Ungli gang...

1568
01:51:07,924 --> 01:51:09,687
That depends on you, sir.

1569
01:51:09,760 --> 01:51:13,355
If you do your work...
we won't be needed.

1570
01:51:13,930 --> 01:51:16,091
That's the thing
about this generation.

1571
01:51:16,233 --> 01:51:18,793
Give them an inch,
and they want a mile.
