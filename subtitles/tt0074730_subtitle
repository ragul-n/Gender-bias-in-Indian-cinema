1
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:36,850
"Tomorrow, new leaves will sprout"
"And new flowers will blossom"

2
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:43,850
"Fresh new footsteps will leave
their mark on new grasslands"

3
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:57,020
"She did not walk into my life
Why, should I enter her life?"

4
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:01,580
"From waking dawns to sunset dusks..."

5
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:09,890
"by what right do I take from her...
the moments that are hers?"

6
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:15,550
"In a moment my poetry will be sung.
In a moment my story will have ended"

7
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:18,450
"For only a moment
I will live in ecstasy"

8
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:27,650
"For I have only a moment
to live my youth"

9
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:29,930
"In a moment my poetry will be sung"

10
00:01:53,790 --> 00:02:02,210
"Many have come before me
Many before me have sung their songs"

11
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:13,210
"Some sang their sorrows
Some sang their hearts out"

12
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:22,340
"They lived their moment
As I live mine"

13
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:29,660
"Tomorrow we will separate"
"But for this moment I'm yours"

14
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:35,390
"In a moment my poetry will be sung"

15
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:49,590
"Tomorrow, there will come another"

16
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:53,550
"In search for the new couplet
In search of the fresh blossom"

17
00:02:55,390 --> 00:03:02,220
"Some will be better poets than I am
Some better listeners than you make"

18
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,420
"In that tomorrow,
will someone remember me?"

19
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:10,740
"But why should anyone
remember me?"

20
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:18,750
"Why should this busy world
waste its time for me?"

21
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:23,710
"For in a moment, my poetry
will have been sung."

22
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:37,580
My autograph?

23
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:40,450
Yes! Your verses are so touching!

24
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:43,650
Did you like it?
- Very much!

25
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:52,420
Why the autograph?
You can keep the verses.

26
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:55,390
Maybe, you're the one
they were written for.

27
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,990
But your name isn't on it...
your name, please.

28
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,460
My name? What is my name?

29
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:07,190
I look at you, and I think
I have forgotten my own name.

30
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,020
Write something... for me.

31
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:13,950
What's your name?

32
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:15,890
Pooja (Worship)

33
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,960
Then maybe I shall call myself
the priest.

34
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,290
Your eyes... have you ever
looked in your eyes?

35
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:29,560
Anything special?

36
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:33,950
One look into those eyes,
and one wishes one could relate.

37
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:49,090
"In silence I shall worship you
Though what I seek I may not have"

38
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:54,720
"To my the object of my worship,
Pooja"

39
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:04,180
Amit

40
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:11,120
"If I can hold your hand
A pleasance will be my journey"

41
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:18,620
"Success enough it is for me
If I win your love for me"

42
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:30,290
"This question that I ask of you
Answer me not if you will not"

43
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:39,890
"But hidden in your silence lie
A thousand words speak themselves"

44
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:50,190
"Every moment this life I live
Each moment I cherish your beauty"

45
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:53,920
"Every time your lips part for me
It is the beginning of a new day"

46
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:57,460
"In the darkness of your hair
The pleasures of a sensual night"

47
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:03,750
"When I hold your hand
A pleasance is my journey"

48
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:12,110
At times, this looks like a dream.

49
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:41,220
Back in the hostel, they go to bed
with your poetry under their pillows.

50
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:45,220
Some have even married
your photographs.

51
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:51,720
If girls know you're in love with me,
they'll kill themselves.

52
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:54,390
Poor girls...

53
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,450
Why "poor"?

54
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,910
They fall in love with
someone's photograph.

55
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:05,580
And then they will marry yet
someone else.

56
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:08,920
If not "poor", how else do you
describe these creatures?

57
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,580
Is it their fault? Parents never ask
a girl for her opinion.

58
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,580
Girls are forced into marriages.

59
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,720
You won't do that, will you?

60
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:23,460
I'll let you have the answer
after I've asked Mom and Dad.

61
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:28,530
Is that a challenge?
Or is it a joke?

62
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,880
Are you propositioning?
Or are you testing waters?

63
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:40,300
I just want to be happy in life.
- What does it take to make you happy?

64
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:45,220
Brighten up my every morning
with a smile from these lips.

65
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:51,020
Bring the light into my nights,
with those eyes of yours.

66
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:56,290
Go on. Flatter me.

67
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,650
Coming from you, I like it.

68
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:10,980
"Sometimes"
"My heart tells me"

69
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:28,690
"You were created for me"

70
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:45,290
"Up there with the stars you were"

71
00:08:54,930 --> 00:09:01,750
"Till you were sent down to earth
for my sake"

72
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:25,120
"My heart tells me at times"

73
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:33,650
"Your body, your soul, your eyes
are mine"

74
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:49,890
"The shade of these tresses
were made for me"

75
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:58,730
"Your body, your lips, your arms
are mine and mine and mine alone"

76
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:27,590
"My heart sings to me sometimes"

77
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:36,420
"In the tunes of the shehnai"
(Shehnai: wind instrument from India)

78
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:52,790
"We are birds in a nest"
"We are to fly away one day"

79
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:59,930
"We will fly far away"

80
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:17,890
"The dazzle of the color red
in the bride's trousseau

81
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:26,460
"The sparkle of the dot
on the bride's forehead"

82
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:36,590
"The chime of bangles on
the bride's hands dyed in henna"

83
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:44,580
"The heartbeats that promise
those beautiful dreams"

84
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:54,720
"The magic of the kohl
in the bride's eyes"

85
00:11:55,530 --> 00:12:03,550
"The subtle scent of flowers
in her hair"

86
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:12,620
"The faint quiver of soft lips"

87
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:19,120
"The blush of the heat on her face"

88
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:27,390
"The musk of her sweat"

89
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:34,410
"The burning desire
of her passions"

90
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:46,260
"The hesitant jingle of her anklets"

91
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:52,450
"With finery she is adorned"

92
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:59,930
"But for whom?"

93
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:08,350
"For whom am I?"

94
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:26,220
"My dear father, the palanquin
that will carry me away from you"

95
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:36,880
"Will not pass through these doors"

96
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:40,320
"Let me go, as if
I were a brick in your wall"

97
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:53,690
"We are birds in a nest"
"We are to fly away one day"

98
00:13:54,030 --> 00:14:00,760
"We will fly far away"

99
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:05,090
Amit, you tell me what should I do.

100
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:08,260
My parents have fixed
my marriage elsewhere.

101
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:11,030
Had I even mentioned you...

102
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:13,420
Oh I can't imagine what
they would've done!

103
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:18,220
There are my parents...
and here you are...

104
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:25,080
I don't know what to do!
Tell me, what am I to do?

105
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:29,700
I think you should marry him.

106
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:31,950
Will you forget me?

107
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:42,950
I'll never forgive myself
the day I forget you.

108
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:47,190
How will I live this life?

109
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:59,190
You'll be a good wife. And I'll try
to become a good human being.

110
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,180
Will you promise me something?

111
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,930
We'd rather not make
any more promises.

112
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,350
I'm asking for my right.

113
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:15,260
Go on.

114
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,730
You won't stop writing poems.

115
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:25,460
Writing poetry isn't mechanical...

116
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,460
say like building a house
with brick and mortar.

117
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:34,750
But if you keep writing,
it will make me happy.

118
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:39,530
Pooja...

119
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:43,160
Yes Amit...

120
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:49,620
Maybe this is the last time
I'm calling you "Pooja".

121
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:56,320
Decided? After due deliberation?
Yes.

122
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:01,260
May I ask why?

123
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:09,600
Even for the sake of our happiness,
we have no right to ignore...

124
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:14,590
the wishes of our parents. We can't
trample upon their sentiments...

125
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:15,790
to build a world for ourselves...

126
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:27,060
That leaves nothing to ask or say.
Nothing!

127
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:38,800
I put together a few poems
for my first anthology.

128
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:45,720
I wanted you to have the first copy.
As a gift of love.

129
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:48,060
With time and circumstance,
this becomes your wedding gift.

130
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,550
Now who would have guessed that?

131
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:07,920
My wedding gift. For you.

132
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:12,920
Were I a poet, I would've
written an anthology for you.

133
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:19,920
Poetry is my weakness.
And this poet in particular.

134
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:22,020
And his anthology,
"Kabhi Kabhie" - "Sometimes".

135
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:26,330
In every line,
he has poured his heart out.

136
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:32,990
If we ever meet happen
to meet this poet...

137
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:36,860
we'll surely ask him to
read his poetry for us.

138
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:44,260
We'll tell him that he was with us
on first night together.

139
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,620
I hear you sing very well.

140
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:55,290
Will you sing one of these verses?
For our first night together...

141
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:08,360
"Sometimes"
"My heart tells me"

142
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:26,150
"You were created for me"

143
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:42,790
"Up there with the stars you were"

144
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:59,720
"Till you were sent down to earth
for my sake"

145
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:18,800
"My heart tells me at times"

146
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:31,030
"Your body, your soul, your eyes
are mine"

147
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:47,560
"The shade of these tresses
were made for me"

148
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:56,190
"Your body, your lips, your arms
are mine and mine and mine alone"

149
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:25,430
"My heart sings to me sometimes"

150
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:33,920
"In the tunes of the shehnai"
(Shehnai: wind instrument from India)

151
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:54,820
"On our first night together
I will lift the veil"

152
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:15,820
"You are shy and you quaver
As I take you in my arms"

153
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:42,790
"My heart asks me"

154
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:46,720
"Will you love me
like this all my life?"

155
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:54,790
"Will you always look at me
with love in your eyes?"

156
00:22:55,860 --> 00:23:03,060
"I know, you belong
to someone else"

157
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:19,430
"But still..."
"Sometimes"

158
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:31,060
"Sometimes"
"I think of you"

159
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,830
Get up.

160
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:23,320
What happened?
Well, what...?

161
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,560
If I walked down to the reception
looking like this...

162
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:39,560
and told the well-dressed
receptionist, "Good morning, miss"...

163
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:43,490
imagine what she will say?
- She'll say, you're shameless.

164
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:48,900
Get up. The sun is shining through.
- The sun never rises on a honeymoon.

165
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:50,170
They say, the honeymoon
is a night of days.

166
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,490
Crazy!

167
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:55,590
Even if the sun happens to rise,
all you have to do...

168
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:58,470
is keep your eyes screwed tight.
That's all it takes to make a night.

169
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:02,190
Haven't you anything else to do?
- No.

170
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:14,920
You know before marrying you,
I used to think that...

171
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:17,920
a man must never marry.
Just waltz through a dozen affairs.

172
00:26:18,330 --> 00:26:22,160
But having done the deed,
my philosophy is completely changed.

173
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:26,760
Marriage is a checking account
in a bank: encashable at will.

174
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:31,770
Encashable only if
you have a balance.

175
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:35,500
Else, your check is likely to bounce.

176
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,060
Let's find out, sweetheart!

177
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,670
Back, son?
Well, what have you decided?

178
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:15,190
I've given up thinking, Dad.

179
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:19,030
You think poetry is the only thing
that needs thinking?

180
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,270
You think I don't think
before I act?

181
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:23,420
I didn't mean that, Dad.

182
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:30,060
That Amit, who used to write poetry...
I've left him far behind.

183
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:34,730
It's your son Amit who is
standing in front of you.

184
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:38,960
And what if you happen to find
your old self once again?

185
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:44,560
In the first place, I'll refuse to
recognise him. But if he's adamant...

186
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:49,500
I'll shake his hand, I'll smile
and I'll walk past him.

187
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:52,230
I hope you aren't
getting emotional?

188
00:27:56,870 --> 00:27:58,300
No father.

189
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:03,120
It isn't that I don't
appreciate your poetry.

190
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,330
I've read your book
several times over.

191
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:08,760
You're a very good poet.
- Let's not discuss it, Dad.

192
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:10,330
No, I'm telling you the truth.

193
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:17,660
But I don't have another son.
I don't have a daughter.

194
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:21,430
You're the only one I have
in this whole wide world.

195
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:25,530
And my business.
And no matter the size...

196
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:31,930
this is the dream I cherish.
I wish you'll make my dream come true.

197
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:36,490
It's what every father
expects from his son.

198
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:47,600
I won't disappoint you, Dad.
You have my word.

199
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:50,400
I won't give you a chance
to complain.

200
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:53,150
I'll fulfil your dream
in every possible way.

201
00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:55,760
I promise you.

202
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,900
Vicky! Bravo, my boy!

203
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:06,230
You aren't riding a mule.
It's a horse! Gallop!

204
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,490
Look how fast he's riding.

205
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,800
He'll take a few falls
before he becomes a good rider.

206
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:16,790
What?

207
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:19,390
He isn't a coward like you.
Stop worrying.

208
00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:22,000
My son is a lion!

209
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:23,990
I know, great lion!
- A lion! Like me!

210
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:25,330
Gitty up!

211
00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:24,830
Excuse me, Miss Pinky...
- How do you know my name?

212
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,170
Leave my hand!
- Never let go of the hand!

213
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:35,500
That's what my Dad says.
- You know what my Mom says?

214
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:38,270
What?
- If a boy ever holds your hand...

215
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:39,900
make sure you slap
him so hard...

216
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:42,270
that his cheek comes out
looking like India's map!

217
00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:48,460
Go ahead with your cartography.

218
00:33:50,370 --> 00:33:53,990
Now my Dad also says that if
a girl is shy, you can conclude...

219
00:33:54,370 --> 00:33:56,990
What's this Dad business?
Are you still a baby?

220
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:02,600
If your Mom meets my Dad,
she'll fall in love with him.

221
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,520
Give my scarf back.

222
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:06,300
You don't ask for a
gift to be returned.

223
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:08,860
Now where would you find
a boyfriend like me?

224
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:13,160
Who would fall for a scarf worth
four-and-three-quarters?

225
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:15,190
Where do you think
you're going, lady?

226
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:25,290
"Being in love isn't wrong"

227
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:40,600
"No one has ever escaped
the passion"

228
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:10,260
"So what if we have kissed?"

229
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:23,590
"So what if we have made love?
We are one at heart"

230
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:34,630
"It's just that this has happened
for the first time in our lives"

231
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,770
"But being in love isn't wrong"

232
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:07,430
"I am mature"
"You are mature too"

233
00:36:07,870 --> 00:36:12,860
"We'll lead the life
we choose to live"

234
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:31,470
"Why listen to them who
don't mean anything to us?"

235
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:36,800
"Being in love isn't wrong"

236
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:58,660
"What is custom?
What is tradition?"

237
00:36:58,970 --> 00:37:01,200
"What is religion?
What is society?"

238
00:37:01,570 --> 00:37:06,730
"Don't be afraid of your enemies
Don't be shy to tell your friends"

239
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:41,270
"No one has ever escaped
the passion"

240
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:46,570
"Being in love isn't wrong"

241
00:37:55,270 --> 00:37:57,240
I've won one more cup, Dad!

242
00:37:58,170 --> 00:37:59,730
Well done! Congratulations!

243
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:04,090
There's more goods news.
- Go on, son.

244
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,560
I'm in love.

245
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:12,770
Bravo, you jerk!
Who's the girl?

246
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:31,070
What's the matter, sir?
You look elated.

247
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:34,200
Matter to be elated over!
My son is in love!

248
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:38,300
After all, he's your son!
- Right! My son!

249
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:40,230
I send him away for studying,
and this jerk falls in love!

250
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:44,490
Let's talk business. Where are
you constructing the hotel?

251
00:38:44,870 --> 00:38:47,600
Near Shyam Nagar. At present
there's no 5-star hotel there.

252
00:38:47,970 --> 00:38:48,960
Has work commenced?
- Yes.

253
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:51,030
But it's up in the mountains.
It'll take time to complete.

254
00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:54,800
Your hotels in Delhi and Bombay
drive people crazy!

255
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,230
Now, why does a person
go to a hotel?

256
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:01,360
Because he wants to do something
without telling his or her spouse.

257
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:02,760
Just walk into a hotel,
and you'll think...

258
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:05,000
you've just walked into
a lingerie show.

259
00:39:12,370 --> 00:39:15,090
Excuse me, I have to go
and see this bore.

260
00:39:15,930 --> 00:39:19,330
Get on with the good work.
I'll see you at the site

261
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:22,940
when I get some free time.
I can't say when, though.

262
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:33,920
This is a neat racket,
Doctor Kapoor.

263
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:38,630
I've built this house out of reading
this baumanometer.

264
00:39:40,470 --> 00:39:43,430
Just a gimmick to get
the rich man's goat.

265
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:46,130
There are simpler ways
to treat this.

266
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:48,090
Now let me say hi to your wife.

267
00:39:52,570 --> 00:39:57,230
Say it straight. You want a drink.
- You're getting smarter. Keep it up.

268
00:39:58,540 --> 00:39:59,830
Stop boring me.
And you must be getting late?

269
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:03,290
Funny doctors pretend
they don't drink.

270
00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:07,790
Hey Shobha! Where are you?
Anybody at home?

271
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:11,130
Hi there. Sit down.

272
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:18,590
What this you're watching?

273
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,100
Even I can do that.
Look here.

274
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:28,770
Today is a Wednesday.
Pooja is coming on tv.

275
00:40:29,770 --> 00:40:34,930
I thought I escaped Pooja!
And here she is! Boring!

276
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:39,730
If you don't want to watch it,
make yourself a drink.

277
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:42,040
The whisky is over there.

278
00:40:45,730 --> 00:40:46,630
Suit myself!

279
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,630
I heard about the great Delhi
hospitality.

280
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:53,630
No reaction?

281
00:40:57,140 --> 00:41:00,630
Come on Vijay Khanna,
help yourself.

282
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:15,630
Today we introduce to you Mr Amit
the famous poet.

283
00:41:15,930 --> 00:41:17,300
He's my favourite!

284
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:20,530
Ms Pooja, you must give the audience
my greetings.

285
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,830
Which you have said
and they have heard.

286
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:28,760
I believe they will be glad
to have this introduction.

287
00:41:29,970 --> 00:41:34,460
What next after "Kabhi Kabhie"?

288
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:39,140
"Kabhi Kabhie" was my first
and perhaps my last anthology.

289
00:41:40,910 --> 00:41:41,800
Meaning?

290
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:43,860
Years ago, I stopped writing poetry.

291
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:52,930
What is a life without
poetry, art and music?

292
00:41:53,400 --> 00:42:02,500
How can you live such
a dry, drab and lonely life?

293
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:08,800
That's the life I'm living.

294
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:13,890
But I'll assure you it isn't
an existence without purpose.

295
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:21,140
Love, it is said is what makes
a man write his first lines.

296
00:42:21,570 --> 00:42:24,500
Or maybe love is what impels a man
to stop writing poetry.

297
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:30,140
But tell me, is this hearsay?
Or is it a personal opinion?

298
00:42:31,770 --> 00:42:35,000
The audience is still waiting
for your answer.

299
00:42:36,370 --> 00:42:40,270
I have said what I have to.
And those who can, will understand.

300
00:42:40,710 --> 00:42:44,760
On behalf of the viewers
and myself, I will ask you...

301
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:48,260
to start writing once again.
For our sake.

302
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:52,700
And now that we are here, how about
reading one of your poems?

303
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:59,260
You might have heard my
poem titled "Kabhi Kabhie".

304
00:42:59,570 --> 00:43:00,540
Yes.

305
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:05,860
I have heard it.
I have read it too.

306
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:12,640
"Kabhi Kabhie" is one facet
of my life.

307
00:43:13,730 --> 00:43:16,630
Long before that,
I had written another poem...

308
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,460
which reveals the other side
of my life.

309
00:43:21,570 --> 00:43:22,800
Here it is...

310
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:27,370
"Sometimes
My heart tells me"

311
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:34,890
"Life could've passed in
The shade of your long tresses then"

312
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:38,500
"The sorrows
That burden my heart today"

313
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:41,970
"In your eyes would
have found solace"

314
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:48,800
"But that was not to be
And such is how it is"

315
00:43:49,310 --> 00:43:52,740
"Not you, nor your desire,
Nor the pangs are"

316
00:43:53,310 --> 00:44:00,430
"Life drags on as if
Life needs no support anymore"

317
00:44:01,370 --> 00:44:05,600
"There is no path, no destination
No light upon my path..."

318
00:44:06,070 --> 00:44:13,130
"Through darkness my life meanders
In this darkness, my way I will lose"

319
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:16,100
"This I know will come to be, my love"

320
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:21,030
"But still
Sometimes, my heart tells me"

321
00:44:21,570 --> 00:44:23,860
"Sometimes, my heart tells me"

322
00:44:30,410 --> 00:44:32,240
It has been so many years.

323
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:36,660
Yes. Many years.
I've started losing count.

324
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:42,100
Come, let's go somewhere.
I have so much to tell you.

325
00:44:43,210 --> 00:44:46,430
Yes. I want to listen to everything
you have to say.

326
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:56,160
Caught you red handed!
I'm smart too.

327
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:02,110
Very pleased to meet you.

328
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:05,130
Long before I became her husband,
I became your fan.

329
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:07,660
Did you tell him about
our first night together?

330
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:10,600
I asked her to sing
one of your poems.

331
00:45:10,910 --> 00:45:14,630
You know, Pooja sings very well!
She's also your fan.

332
00:45:16,570 --> 00:45:17,540
Mr Amit...
- Yes?

333
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:19,100
I have a small request.
- Tell me.

334
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:22,700
Come to my house and
join me for a drink.

335
00:45:23,210 --> 00:45:28,100
I'd be very happy. Pooja would
be happy too. Yes, Pooja?

336
00:45:28,540 --> 00:45:30,510
If that's so important,
well let's do it.

337
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:43,760
It's coke for you isn't it, Pooja?

338
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:45,760
Come on, why don't you take
a drink at times?

339
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:49,360
I've taken up a lot of good habits
from you. Spare me this one.

340
00:45:49,710 --> 00:45:53,070
Ever since she married me, she has
been getting smarter and smarter.

341
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:55,770
What's your opinion?
- I haven't one.

342
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:57,260
It's a matter between
husband and wife.

343
00:45:58,870 --> 00:46:02,330
You aren't an outsider.
Our relationship is very old.

344
00:46:02,710 --> 00:46:05,460
I've known you for years.
As a poet.

345
00:46:06,170 --> 00:46:09,400
But Pooja, you missed something
in that interview.

346
00:46:09,710 --> 00:46:11,610
Missed?
- Yes.

347
00:46:11,910 --> 00:46:15,100
You never said anything
about Mr Amit's poetry.

348
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:18,600
There's pathos in his every line.

349
00:46:19,070 --> 00:46:21,300
The pangs of love...

350
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:25,290
as if he was scarred.

351
00:46:25,870 --> 00:46:29,310
At least you could've asked him
who she was.

352
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:34,000
Not your fault, you know.
You didn't fall in love.

353
00:46:34,330 --> 00:46:36,770
You don't know the lover's plight.

354
00:46:38,540 --> 00:46:40,230
That poem of yours...

355
00:46:41,010 --> 00:46:50,170
"Sometimes if we cross paths
You will pretend not to know me"

356
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:55,670
"Sometimes when my name is mentioned
You will feign ignorance"

357
00:46:56,040 --> 00:47:00,200
"Of me? You have never heard"

358
00:47:06,770 --> 00:47:14,430
"Sometimes if we cross paths
You will pretend not to know me"

359
00:47:14,870 --> 00:47:22,170
"Sometimes when my name is mentioned
You will feign ignorance"

360
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:23,740
"Of me? You have never heard"

361
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:30,030
Look, I don't build houses,
I build homes.

362
00:47:30,810 --> 00:47:35,060
And walls and doors and windows
don't make homes.

363
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:37,160
It takes people to make homes.

364
00:47:37,670 --> 00:47:41,660
How they think, how they feel,
how they live their lives...

365
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:45,970
and the people who visit their homes
...their friends, their foes...

366
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,300
The house they live in,
pictures what they are.

367
00:47:48,670 --> 00:47:51,510
It means, a man's status is
revealed from his residence.

368
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:57,060
See me in my office on Monday.
I'll give you the details.

369
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:08,560
Where's Mr Amit?
- He has left.

370
00:48:09,370 --> 00:48:14,360
Without as much as telling me?
These poets are really moody.

371
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:16,770
Looks like he has suffered.

372
00:48:19,710 --> 00:48:21,870
That question during the interview
was a good one.

373
00:48:22,070 --> 00:48:24,600
That girl has ruined his life.

374
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:35,560
All you men think alike. In the end,
it's the woman who gets all the blame.

375
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:41,640
Men are selfish. We never even think
what the woman has to go through.

376
00:48:42,610 --> 00:48:45,500
By the way, your son called.
- Anything special?

377
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:48,740
Very special!
- What?

378
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:52,970
Is that why he called?
- You don't know this, Pooja.

379
00:48:53,340 --> 00:48:57,630
When I first fell in love,
I wanted to tell everyone!

380
00:48:58,070 --> 00:49:01,630
Whenever I was alone, I used to scream
at the top of my voice, "I'm in love"

381
00:49:07,170 --> 00:49:10,070
Not over and over and over again...
Look, over there.

382
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:20,270
Such a beautiful place!

383
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:24,000
For ages, the mountains have
stood here. In silence.

384
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:27,430
As if they've been waiting
all this while for us.

385
00:49:28,510 --> 00:49:33,500
And the golden sun lying
on the snow over there.

386
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:38,870
And the trees standing like
hermits worshipping nature...

387
00:49:39,610 --> 00:49:41,100
And you don't even
seem to notice.

388
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:48,370
"I can't take my eyes off you"

389
00:49:48,810 --> 00:49:52,000
"Nature's beauty means nothing to me"

390
00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:02,240
"My desire isn't sated yet"

391
00:50:02,740 --> 00:50:05,960
"Nature's beauty means nothing to me"

392
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:24,270
"Your eyes burns with desire"

393
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:29,100
"Like the fire upon snows"

394
00:50:42,580 --> 00:50:48,970
"My body is on fire"

395
00:50:49,470 --> 00:50:52,440
"Nature's beauty means nothing to me"

396
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:25,870
"There lies a sea of colors
and fragrances"

397
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:31,770
"But we don't even know
if it's the day or the night"

398
00:51:45,570 --> 00:51:51,600
"A whole Universe
I can feel within myself"

399
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:54,830
"Nature's beauty means nothing to me"

400
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:26,830
"I see the shadow of my eye-lids
in your eyes"

401
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:31,640
"In your face I can see
my emotions mirrored"

402
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:51,100
"I have never had enough of you"

403
00:52:58,740 --> 00:53:04,790
"I always crave to meet you...

404
00:53:34,250 --> 00:53:36,300
Goodbye kiss!

405
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:39,170
I'll call you.
- I'll wait.

406
00:53:39,710 --> 00:53:41,400
What are you gaping at?
- The scene.

407
00:53:41,710 --> 00:53:43,270
Keep going.
- Sure.

408
00:54:02,510 --> 00:54:04,000
Where's Papa?
- Inside.

409
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:05,300
Inside?

410
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:27,640
Is Pinky home?

411
00:54:27,940 --> 00:54:29,130
Pinky...? No.

412
00:54:30,940 --> 00:54:32,570
But I just heard her voice.

413
00:54:34,250 --> 00:54:37,730
An illusion, maybe?
- Very strange.

414
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:42,610
Give yourself a treatment, doctor.

415
00:54:47,310 --> 00:54:49,930
Pinky my baby!

416
00:54:55,970 --> 00:54:56,940
Where's my tape recorder?

417
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:04,310
Shut your eyes...
- Done.

418
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:10,870
Now say, "Open Sesame"

419
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:13,980
Open Sesame
- Louder.

420
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:16,960
Here comes your tape recorder.

421
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:23,650
Keep yourselves company.
I've a lot of work to do.

422
00:55:24,010 --> 00:55:26,970
I'll cook up a sweet and...

423
00:55:27,340 --> 00:55:29,070
potato in sour sauce.
Right?

424
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:48,640
Your coming has brightened up
our lives!

425
00:55:49,940 --> 00:55:53,740
Without you this house
looked so empty.

426
00:55:54,050 --> 00:55:58,270
I'll never leave you.
- But you'll have.

427
00:55:58,570 --> 00:56:01,240
Why?
- Someone will marry you someday.

428
00:56:02,550 --> 00:56:05,130
Isn't it possible to I bring home
the man I marry?

429
00:56:07,310 --> 00:56:09,600
You mad girl, go to your
room and change.

430
00:56:09,910 --> 00:56:10,810
My patients are waiting.

431
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:32,240
Ramdeen, Govind where
the hell are you?

432
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:36,900
Come up here
Can't you hear me?

433
00:56:38,340 --> 00:56:40,570
What happened sweetheart?
- Everything is in a mess!

434
00:56:40,940 --> 00:56:44,170
Who removed my photograph
from here? Who came in here?

435
00:56:49,340 --> 00:56:53,210
Your father used to come
to your room.

436
00:56:55,170 --> 00:56:57,830
He missed you.

437
00:56:58,310 --> 00:57:03,440
He comes here and
sits here for hours.

438
00:57:04,050 --> 00:57:06,940
He fiddles with your things.

439
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:13,110
He took your photograph.
It's on the table by his bed.

440
00:57:14,510 --> 00:57:18,530
He kisses the photo every night
before he goes to bed.

441
00:57:24,050 --> 00:57:30,100
My baby, I can't live without you.

442
00:57:41,340 --> 00:57:42,240
Yes, it's me.

443
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:45,760
What are you up to?
- Nothing.

444
00:57:46,210 --> 00:57:48,900
When are you seeing me?
- I just left you.

445
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:51,310
Can I come over?
- Why?

446
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:54,170
I can't take my eyes off you.

447
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:07,200
Go on...
- Buddy, so when are we meeting?

448
00:58:09,110 --> 00:58:10,010
Eleven tomorrow?

449
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:12,070
Are you on grass or something?

450
00:58:12,450 --> 00:58:13,710
Just came in from the garden.

451
00:58:14,050 --> 00:58:15,440
Yes. Daddy is here.
And he's fine.

452
00:58:15,870 --> 00:58:18,670
He's in his room making plans
for a new house. For us.

453
00:58:19,580 --> 00:58:22,480
So Daddy's breathing down your neck?
Scared of Daddy?

454
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:24,860
Not at all.

455
00:58:26,210 --> 00:58:29,900
Eleven sharp tomorrow, then?

456
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:32,380
On one condition.
- What?

457
00:58:42,010 --> 00:58:43,310
Not now, man!

458
00:58:52,410 --> 00:58:59,240
Look, at times, a man is helpless!
Try to understand.

459
00:58:59,940 --> 00:59:00,970
Then I won't come.

460
00:59:01,210 --> 00:59:04,970
Now don't do this.
Eleven tomorrow, right?

461
00:59:05,370 --> 00:59:06,960
No...
- Pinky, please man...

462
00:59:24,450 --> 00:59:26,930
In my time, I've had
my share of flings.

463
00:59:27,370 --> 00:59:29,930
This is just your first time.

464
00:59:31,540 --> 00:59:34,710
Dad, just you wait and watch.

465
00:59:34,970 --> 00:59:39,740
As if you've won the the cup
for the greatest casanova.

466
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:45,030
Call it my jackpot in the derby.

467
00:59:49,340 --> 00:59:51,570
Who's this girl? Tell me.

468
00:59:52,010 --> 00:59:57,030
Making friends with Dad
could be profitable.

469
00:59:59,410 --> 01:00:03,640
She's from your part of the world.
- From Delhi? And I don't know her?

470
01:00:04,150 --> 01:00:07,700
She's in school with me.
Her father is a doctor.

471
01:00:09,010 --> 01:00:10,740
Dr R.P. Kapoor

472
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:19,140
You mean my doctor's daughter?
Made my day!

473
01:00:19,580 --> 01:00:23,210
Didn't I say, my son will show
his colors someday!

474
01:00:23,650 --> 01:00:24,740
You fool! Did you hear that?

475
01:00:29,910 --> 01:00:34,610
Your son is in love with
my doctor's daughter.

476
01:00:34,970 --> 01:00:38,410
What?
Look he's feeling shy.

477
01:00:39,980 --> 01:00:41,200
Come, let's launch the attack!

478
01:00:41,580 --> 01:00:44,310
I had warned him to take care
of his daughter. Let's go.

479
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:45,870
But in this state...?
- What do you mean?

480
01:00:46,270 --> 01:00:47,170
Let me change my dress.

481
01:00:47,670 --> 01:00:52,370
What for? For impressing people?
I've been impressed for years!

482
01:00:52,810 --> 01:00:55,900
What are you laughing at you jackass?
She's your mother!

483
01:00:56,340 --> 01:00:58,500
Come on, pick her up.
- What are you doing?

484
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:03,510
Was that an important caller?

485
01:01:03,810 --> 01:01:08,670
Yes... a friend, she came along
with me from the hostel.

486
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:11,400
And you like her a lot?
- Yes.

487
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:16,400
Ever since we've met, it's
as though, we're in love...

488
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:19,900
It happens doesn't it Dad?
You meet someone for the first time...

489
01:01:20,180 --> 01:01:22,540
and you get involved for a lifetime.

490
01:01:22,980 --> 01:01:26,600
It happens, especially
to people your age.

491
01:01:27,710 --> 01:01:30,400
What's his name?
- What?

492
01:01:30,780 --> 01:01:32,770
You're caught.

493
01:01:33,310 --> 01:01:37,170
Won't you tell us
your girlfriend's name?

494
01:01:38,980 --> 01:01:40,530
Hey Doctor, come out man!

495
01:01:43,580 --> 01:01:46,670
Doctor, didn't I say my son
will show his colors someday?

496
01:01:46,970 --> 01:01:47,870
Colors...?

497
01:02:00,180 --> 01:02:01,510
With your permission?

498
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:04,510
God bless you.

499
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:18,160
Let me take a look at you.
Shobha she looks just like you.

500
01:02:19,140 --> 01:02:22,580
You used to be my friend's wife.
The relationship is changing.

501
01:02:22,810 --> 01:02:25,170
Henceforth our relations
have changed.

502
01:02:25,570 --> 01:02:28,700
I have a right to flirt with you
from now on. Right, doctor?

503
01:02:29,110 --> 01:02:31,580
With Pooja's permission.

504
01:02:31,950 --> 01:02:32,910
As if he needs permission.

505
01:02:33,310 --> 01:02:34,540
He's the father of a grown-up son,
and look at him.

506
01:02:34,780 --> 01:02:39,540
Still up to childish pranks.
- I'm young at heart!

507
01:02:39,780 --> 01:02:41,210
Come into my arms, Shobha!

508
01:03:44,980 --> 01:03:50,470
What are you doing? You're wet!
Fatty, I'll fix you!

509
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:09,140
Who is it on your mind? Dad kissed
you before he left, didn't he?

510
01:05:24,280 --> 01:05:25,800
Shall I ask you something?
- Ask.

511
01:05:26,210 --> 01:05:29,440
When you were in college,
there must've been...

512
01:05:29,740 --> 01:05:32,240
an ambulance trailing behind you.
- Meaning...?

513
01:05:32,680 --> 01:05:36,770
I mean, men must've been fainting
left and right.

514
01:05:37,210 --> 01:05:39,840
Apple-polishing, is this?
Shut up.

515
01:05:40,350 --> 01:05:44,010
You must've liked someone.
Else you wouldn't be humming.

516
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:45,710
Look, don't tell lies.
Tell me the truth.

517
01:05:49,410 --> 01:05:51,640
Those were the days in college.
Those days are gone.

518
01:05:52,780 --> 01:05:54,540
But we weren't like you.

519
01:05:55,250 --> 01:05:58,400
You meet a girl in the morning,
and by evening, you're engaged.

520
01:05:58,980 --> 01:06:02,810
In your times, people went platonic
for six months!

521
01:06:03,180 --> 01:06:06,200
For a year afterwards, hello's,
how-are-you's and niceties.

522
01:06:06,440 --> 01:06:08,410
By the time you get to start
a relationship...

523
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:13,740
she gets to know that her parents
have fixed her wedding elsewhere.

524
01:06:13,980 --> 01:06:16,530
Which leaves the poor Romeo
to play uncle to Juliet's baby.

525
01:06:30,750 --> 01:06:33,180
Pinky looks so happy.
She's very lucky.

526
01:06:35,470 --> 01:06:40,710
The boy is so nice.
And it's a good family.

527
01:06:43,020 --> 01:06:44,180
What are you thinking about?

528
01:06:45,770 --> 01:06:52,440
She's going to get engaged.
And then, comes the wedding.

529
01:06:52,780 --> 01:06:57,940
Don't worry. I've put together
a dowry for Pinky.

530
01:06:58,780 --> 01:07:01,680
I'm her mother. I know my duty.

531
01:07:02,310 --> 01:07:05,540
I'm not talking about that.
- Then what is it?

532
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:10,200
Look, Pinky's in-law's
live in the same city.

533
01:07:11,580 --> 01:07:14,410
In a way that's good.
We can keep seeing here.

534
01:07:15,770 --> 01:07:18,940
That's just why the secret
can longer be kept a secret.

535
01:07:19,510 --> 01:07:20,540
What secret?

536
01:07:24,750 --> 01:07:26,940
You know fully well. But you'd
rather have me speak about it.

537
01:07:31,980 --> 01:07:37,430
I don't know any secret.
- We shouldn't be selfish.

538
01:07:38,340 --> 01:07:41,870
I can understand, how painful
it's going to be for you.

539
01:07:42,680 --> 01:07:44,580
But we should make
a clean breast of it.

540
01:07:46,180 --> 01:07:49,370
Have you ever thought
where this is going to end?

541
01:07:51,350 --> 01:07:54,580
Even I'm scared when
I think about it.

542
01:07:56,340 --> 01:08:01,610
But how long can we keep it a secret?
Besides, the Khannas are our friends.

543
01:08:02,050 --> 01:08:04,850
When they come to know,
we'll lose face.

544
01:08:05,050 --> 01:08:08,440
Then why are you asking me?
Go and keep up your face.

545
01:08:08,810 --> 01:08:12,940
You always get your way with things.
Do whatever you want.

546
01:08:24,050 --> 01:08:27,870
I knew long ago that Pinky
could never be your daughter!

547
01:08:30,150 --> 01:08:34,050
You're such a bore and
she's such a sweet girl.

548
01:08:34,690 --> 01:08:38,300
We're the bridespeople, after all.
You have the upper hand. Go on.

549
01:08:38,680 --> 01:08:43,910
I won't let you off lightly.
We don't measure people...

550
01:08:44,150 --> 01:08:47,910
by labels and families.
It's the heart that counts.

551
01:08:48,350 --> 01:08:49,900
Am I right Pooja?

552
01:08:52,020 --> 01:08:54,380
He wants my opinion?

553
01:08:55,150 --> 01:08:57,170
Don't you let go of your chance.

554
01:08:57,840 --> 01:09:01,300
I need someone to second me.
Besides, you're my wife.

555
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:05,170
Will you ever speak against me?
- Sure. That's what wives are for.

556
01:09:06,780 --> 01:09:11,770
I think you should
tell Pinky everything.

557
01:09:12,450 --> 01:09:14,850
Are you out of your mind?

558
01:09:15,320 --> 01:09:18,940
Pooja, you don't know Pinky.

559
01:09:21,650 --> 01:09:24,480
I don't think it's a good idea
to tell her.

560
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:30,480
The earlier we learn to
trust our children, the better.

561
01:09:32,050 --> 01:09:35,420
Tomorrow they shouldn't blame
us for cooking up things.

562
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:41,550
When a child falls,
he bruises himself.

563
01:09:43,020 --> 01:09:46,740
If the child was pushed,
the wound could run deep.

564
01:09:48,550 --> 01:09:52,350
Today, Pinky is a girl.
Tomorrow, she will become a woman.

565
01:09:52,550 --> 01:09:54,520
She might never forgive us.

566
01:09:57,010 --> 01:10:01,570
This is not true! Tell me Papa
that I'm your daughter!

567
01:10:01,850 --> 01:10:05,770
Pinky my child, I...
- I'm my Mama's baby! Tell me!

568
01:10:07,910 --> 01:10:15,210
Yes! You're our daughter, dear.
Our darling daughter.

569
01:10:15,780 --> 01:10:17,940
Then why did you say that
I have another mother?

570
01:10:18,310 --> 01:10:21,480
I don't have another Mom.
Even if it were true...

571
01:10:21,720 --> 01:10:26,610
you should never have told me.
- I told him, but he insisted.

572
01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:29,810
Shobha, we shouldn't be selfish.

573
01:10:31,050 --> 01:10:34,140
If it's selfishness
to be a mother...

574
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:38,210
if it's selfishness to crave
for a daughter's love...

575
01:10:38,650 --> 01:10:40,550
then I'd rather be
be a selfish woman.

576
01:10:40,820 --> 01:10:41,750
Pinky my child...

577
01:10:44,390 --> 01:10:46,470
how long could we have
kept this a secret?

578
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:51,180
After the wedding, when the documents
relating to your inheritance...

579
01:10:51,550 --> 01:10:55,250
are handed over to you,
the truth would surely out.

580
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:59,900
Your natural mother is still alive.
We are your foster parents.

581
01:11:01,680 --> 01:11:04,850
All of a sudden,
there comes up a name.

582
01:11:05,910 --> 01:11:13,180
A name that never concerned me.
Someone I was never related to.

583
01:11:14,150 --> 01:11:18,540
And today, she's my mother.
I have become her daughter.

584
01:11:19,180 --> 01:11:21,080
But what difference does
it make?

585
01:11:21,680 --> 01:11:24,240
A lot of difference!

586
01:11:25,250 --> 01:11:26,710
You pick up a plant
you have cared for...

587
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:30,480
you pull it out by the roots,
you throw it away...

588
01:11:31,110 --> 01:11:33,210
and you say that it makes no
difference to you!

589
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:36,600
It will kill the plant!
It will kill me!

590
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:49,610
I forgot it. I'm not Pinky's mother.
I've forgotten it for years!

591
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:52,780
And today...

592
01:12:05,550 --> 01:12:07,700
What difference does it make?

593
01:12:08,210 --> 01:12:09,770
She deserted you
after you were born.

594
01:12:10,010 --> 01:12:11,450
And today, she means
so much for you?

595
01:12:11,720 --> 01:12:16,440
And those who gave you all their
love... they mean nothing to you?

596
01:12:17,210 --> 01:12:22,770
What do I do? Today I hesitate even
to ask for a cup of tea in that house.

597
01:12:23,550 --> 01:12:26,100
To think that I used
to throw a tantrum...

598
01:12:26,440 --> 01:12:29,340
every time I wasn't given
what I wanted.

599
01:12:29,680 --> 01:12:33,050
When I didn't like the food,
I'd smash the plates.

600
01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:38,740
But today, I haven't
the guts to say a word.

601
01:12:39,050 --> 01:12:43,640
Great! This is how you
pay your parents back!

602
01:12:43,950 --> 01:12:46,340
Is this how you repay
their love for you?

603
01:12:46,610 --> 01:12:49,880
Just because somewhere there's
a woman who gave birth to you.

604
01:12:50,180 --> 01:12:52,650
So that's why she's your Mother.

605
01:12:52,850 --> 01:12:55,750
Why rake up the past?
What've you got to do with her?

606
01:12:55,980 --> 01:12:57,880
Listen to me.
Forget the story.

607
01:12:58,710 --> 01:13:02,440
This is not a story.
There is someone.

608
01:13:02,790 --> 01:13:06,680
She bore me.
She is my mother.

609
01:13:07,350 --> 01:13:11,980
You know what the word mother means?
This one word has changed my life.

610
01:13:12,280 --> 01:13:14,770
She has snatched my family away!

611
01:13:32,450 --> 01:13:37,540
What about our love, the wedding,
our life together?

612
01:13:39,380 --> 01:13:43,010
I can't say anything now.
- Or you don't want to?

613
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:46,070
Please, Vicky.
Try to understand me.

614
01:13:46,740 --> 01:13:50,270
I don't even know why my
mother deserted me.

615
01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:53,210
What was her problem?

616
01:13:54,490 --> 01:13:57,740
I don't even know who my Dad is.

617
01:14:00,850 --> 01:14:05,010
I wish to know about myself.
Why don't you understand?

618
01:14:17,550 --> 01:14:21,040
What do you want to do?
- I'll meet my mother.

619
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:23,310
Then?
- What do you mean?

620
01:14:23,550 --> 01:14:26,770
I mean, what after that?
- This I can't tell now.

621
01:14:28,210 --> 01:14:31,110
Because you don't know?
- Yes.

622
01:14:32,380 --> 01:14:35,110
When do you wish to go?
- As soon as possible.

623
01:14:35,820 --> 01:14:38,680
Very well. We'll both
go and see your mother.

624
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:41,050
You aren't coming with me.
- Why?

625
01:14:41,550 --> 01:14:42,980
Because this is a personal matter.

626
01:14:43,850 --> 01:14:46,010
Am I an outsider?
- I didn't say that.

627
01:14:46,450 --> 01:14:49,470
Alone! In a strange place!
Among strange people...!

628
01:14:49,710 --> 01:14:52,580
I can take care of myself.
- But I'm coming with you.

629
01:15:23,890 --> 01:15:24,850
Where have you been all morning?

630
01:15:39,480 --> 01:15:43,110
Have you had a drink before?
- Beer.

631
01:15:46,850 --> 01:15:47,970
Only one peg.

632
01:15:56,180 --> 01:15:57,740
Had a fight with Pinky?

633
01:16:00,450 --> 01:16:02,010
What's the problem, son?

634
01:16:04,990 --> 01:16:09,070
What difference would it have made
had God not created woman?

635
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:11,680
You wouldn't have been born.

636
01:16:12,050 --> 01:16:16,010
God has created woman so that
you can grow up and abuse her.

637
01:16:16,310 --> 01:16:17,710
You're becoming indecent
day by day.

638
01:16:18,010 --> 01:16:20,710
I'm not talking about you.
I'm talking about Pinky.

639
01:16:20,910 --> 01:16:23,310
She picked a fight with me,
and she walked out on me.

640
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:26,160
Where has she gone?
- To find her newfound mother.

641
01:16:26,350 --> 01:16:27,610
And you let her go?

642
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:31,650
To a strange place...
to meet strangers...?

643
01:16:32,550 --> 01:16:36,110
What if in a weak moment,
she does something wrong?

644
01:16:36,680 --> 01:16:37,770
What else could I do?

645
01:16:38,150 --> 01:16:39,840
I told her, I'm ready
to go with her.

646
01:16:40,150 --> 01:16:44,310
But she screamed at me!
And she said no one goes with her.

647
01:16:44,650 --> 01:16:49,840
She says a no, and you drop the idea?
And you're madly in love with her?

648
01:16:50,080 --> 01:16:51,520
Don't call my love mad, Dad!

649
01:16:51,780 --> 01:16:53,440
Be a man!

650
01:16:54,520 --> 01:16:56,810
If you love her, then follow
her to the end of the world.

651
01:16:57,450 --> 01:17:02,410
Bring her back.
Prove that you're my son.

652
01:17:09,250 --> 01:17:12,680
Vicky, where are you going?!
Ask him where he's going.

653
01:17:13,150 --> 01:17:15,810
Don't you want your son
to know his responsibilities?

654
01:17:16,510 --> 01:17:21,880
Let him make his own decisions.
Let him stand on his own feet.

655
01:18:25,660 --> 01:18:26,350
Yes?

656
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:31,580
My name is Pinky.

657
01:18:33,490 --> 01:18:36,320
I'm coming from Delhi.
From Dr Kapoor's...

658
01:18:52,020 --> 01:18:54,780
Who is it, Anju?

659
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:01,780
Who is this?

660
01:19:03,020 --> 01:19:04,320
My niece.

661
01:19:05,820 --> 01:19:06,780
Your uncle.

662
01:19:10,850 --> 01:19:12,080
How did you come alone?

663
01:19:12,750 --> 01:19:15,090
Weren't you afraid of taking
such a long journey all alone?

664
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:18,970
No news. And no letter.
You could've sent us a telegram.

665
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:21,820
She might've decided
on the spur of the moment.

666
01:19:22,450 --> 01:19:26,470
I'm seeing you after years.
I couldn't recognise you.

667
01:19:27,080 --> 01:19:31,350
You wouldn't even remember me.
You were very small then.

668
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:32,820
20 years...

669
01:19:33,850 --> 01:19:37,010
Come, I'll show you
to your room.

670
01:19:47,550 --> 01:19:50,910
This is your room. Take a bath.
The bathroom is there.

671
01:19:52,150 --> 01:19:54,450
Take a hot water bath.
You'll feel fresh.

672
01:19:55,890 --> 01:19:58,640
I'll lay the table
in the meantime.

673
01:20:14,450 --> 01:20:15,750
What's her name?

674
01:20:16,910 --> 01:20:17,810
Pinky

675
01:20:20,650 --> 01:20:21,810
Why has she come here?

676
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:26,150
Why does one come to visit
a relative?

677
01:20:28,780 --> 01:20:30,750
And what did you say
your cousin's name is?

678
01:20:31,580 --> 01:20:33,310
Mrs Shobha Kapoor

679
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:50,780
Strange, isn't it? A strange face,
a strange name you never heard of...

680
01:20:51,150 --> 01:20:58,050
comes knocking, and tells you,
let's play relatives.

681
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:04,880
Even I was surprised to see her.
- So I thought.

682
01:21:21,780 --> 01:21:24,080
She's your cousin
from Delhi.

683
01:21:27,250 --> 01:21:28,940
Papa, isn't she sweet?

684
01:21:29,580 --> 01:21:30,740
Come, sit here.

685
01:21:31,790 --> 01:21:35,020
Let Pinky sit beside me.

686
01:21:40,790 --> 01:21:41,750
Come Pinky.

687
01:22:13,150 --> 01:22:14,380
Start, Pinky.

688
01:22:16,160 --> 01:22:17,380
Come on, let me serve you.

689
01:22:20,750 --> 01:22:21,910
Pass the bowl, Sweety.

690
01:22:37,850 --> 01:22:39,010
How was your day?

691
01:22:42,190 --> 01:22:43,950
Invite me sometime for the game.

692
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:49,210
Don't you play any games?
- Sometimes.

693
01:22:54,190 --> 01:22:56,090
How about a match between
Pinky and Sweety?

694
01:22:56,460 --> 01:23:00,010
I'm not losing a match.
Won't you back me up, Papa?

695
01:23:02,890 --> 01:23:04,290
And I'll back Pinky.

696
01:23:04,620 --> 01:23:06,520
Not one to hundred.
One to a thousand!

697
01:23:24,890 --> 01:23:30,790
Come to me, my child.
- What's it Papa?

698
01:23:31,550 --> 01:23:35,890
I'll show you a cartoon.
Looks just like you.

699
01:23:36,520 --> 01:23:41,750
I don't want to see it.
- Why are you angry with me?

700
01:23:42,790 --> 01:23:45,020
Show me all your teeth. Let's see
how you look when you smile.

701
01:23:54,620 --> 01:23:58,740
Papa, will you recite that poem?
- Which one?

702
01:23:59,120 --> 01:24:02,750
The one you had written about me
when I was very small.

703
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:09,450
Let your Mummy recite that poem.

704
01:24:10,090 --> 01:24:11,310
Anjali...

705
01:24:12,020 --> 01:24:16,390
Recite that poem...
- All right.

706
01:24:16,980 --> 01:24:20,580
Come and sit beside me.

707
01:24:33,060 --> 01:24:40,920
"A little fairy came to my house"

708
01:24:44,520 --> 01:24:49,750
"She came riding on a chariot
lit with the moonlight"

709
01:25:08,850 --> 01:25:13,150
"Her words were as sweet
as honey"

710
01:25:14,690 --> 01:25:18,270
"On her breath, the smell of perfumes"

711
01:25:20,490 --> 01:25:24,650
"Her lips were like wet roses"

712
01:25:24,890 --> 01:25:29,320
"Her cheeks were the color of
ripe pomegranates"

713
01:25:29,620 --> 01:25:37,380
"That was the little fairy
who came to my house"

714
01:25:50,850 --> 01:25:54,620
"When she came,
the spring came with her"

715
01:25:55,120 --> 01:25:59,410
"And flowers blossomed
in my house"

716
01:26:02,520 --> 01:26:06,750
"I have seen her a thousand times"

717
01:26:07,120 --> 01:26:14,720
"But I can't take my eyes off her"

718
01:26:15,760 --> 01:26:24,120
"She's the little fairy
who came to my house"

719
01:26:36,220 --> 01:26:40,380
"Then I asked her
Who are you?"

720
01:26:42,290 --> 01:26:46,720
"She smiled and said
I'm your love"

721
01:26:47,980 --> 01:26:52,320
"I've lived in your heart forever"

722
01:26:52,720 --> 01:26:56,590
"This is the first time
I've come to your home"

723
01:26:56,930 --> 01:27:04,340
"She's the little fairy
who came to my house"

724
01:27:08,580 --> 01:27:14,490
"She came riding on a chariot
lit with the moonlight"

725
01:27:28,380 --> 01:27:30,980
What a beautiful poem!
You write so well.

726
01:27:32,690 --> 01:27:35,050
Why don't you write a poem
about Pinky?

727
01:27:35,190 --> 01:27:37,310
Why about Pinky?

728
01:27:37,550 --> 01:27:39,380
He's my Papa.
He'll write about me.

729
01:27:39,690 --> 01:27:41,450
He won't write about anyone else!
Not even about you!

730
01:28:04,590 --> 01:28:06,490
You shouldn't talk like
that before a guest.

731
01:28:08,450 --> 01:28:09,080
Who is she?

732
01:28:09,520 --> 01:28:12,010
I cannot tell you yet
who you are.

733
01:28:12,690 --> 01:28:14,090
How long will she stay in our house?

734
01:28:14,520 --> 01:28:15,960
How long can I hide this?

735
01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:17,800
It's just a matter of a few days.

736
01:28:18,180 --> 01:28:19,620
She isn't going to stay here forever.

737
01:28:20,050 --> 01:28:22,820
The way Mummy was looking at her!
As if she's loathe to leave her!

738
01:28:23,520 --> 01:28:24,750
Why did you leave me?

739
01:28:30,920 --> 01:28:36,360
As of now, you will not understand.
Neither can I explain this.

740
01:28:39,080 --> 01:28:43,250
Our well-wishers purport to act
in the best of our interests.

741
01:28:45,590 --> 01:28:47,180
I've suffered for it.

742
01:28:48,980 --> 01:28:51,320
I haven't seen my daughter
in 20 years...

743
01:28:53,490 --> 01:28:56,790
the daughter I bore.

744
01:28:58,980 --> 01:29:02,920
In life, these petty event
come and go.

745
01:29:03,890 --> 01:29:07,980
One who understands and
adjusts accordingly, is wise.

746
01:29:08,650 --> 01:29:13,280
May I call you my mother?

747
01:29:17,580 --> 01:29:18,280
No.

748
01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:21,080
Not yet.

749
01:29:42,290 --> 01:29:44,520
Vicky you? Here?

750
01:29:45,890 --> 01:29:49,040
Your tears tell me that you've been
crying your heart out for me.

751
01:29:54,060 --> 01:30:00,110
Aren't my eyes telling you something?
At least you can do me the courtesy...

752
01:30:00,420 --> 01:30:03,180
of asking if I've had
a pleasant journey.

753
01:30:03,960 --> 01:30:05,450
Vicky, I'm very disturbed.

754
01:30:06,660 --> 01:30:07,780
So you've met your mother,
haven't you?

755
01:30:09,290 --> 01:30:10,780
You shouldn't have come here.

756
01:30:11,550 --> 01:30:13,610
Now that you're here,
make sure you don't meet me.

757
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:16,820
Even if we meet, make sure
you don't recognise me.

758
01:30:17,650 --> 01:30:21,680
I have a past and you know that.
But there's no place in it for you.

759
01:30:23,660 --> 01:30:26,150
Don't you rub it in!

760
01:30:35,320 --> 01:30:36,990
I didn't come here to
enjoy myself.

761
01:30:38,350 --> 01:30:40,150
Watch this!
