00:00:05,812 --> 00:00:11,524
There are people who pretizhavat
power which can clearly ...

2
00:00:11,979 --> 00:00:14,454
... to provide incident
or accidents long before ...

3
00:00:15,624 --> 00:00:18,122
they happen, this power
is called clairvoyance.

4
00:00:18,899 --> 00:00:21,682
Meaning sight or
Ekstraseansno prediction.

5
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:26,881
These eyes have the same
that similar power.

6
00:00:27,401 --> 00:00:28,757
They can clearly provide
future upcoming events ...

7
00:00:29,108 --> 00:00:33,061
... and accidents with
people involved in it ...

8
00:00:33,617 --> 00:00:35,955
... in the context and situation.

9
00:00:36,863 --> 00:00:40,197
These eyes belong to
heroine of our film, Devi.

10
00:02:56,875 --> 00:03:00,771
Hey, What's
Devi, what is your?

11
00:03:01,586 --> 00:03:02,935
What about you?

12
00:03:03,946 --> 00:03:07,318
I saw a man put in the mac.

13
00:03:08,262 --> 00:03:10,806
And girl you drying your hair.

14
00:03:11,869 --> 00:03:14,733
I saw a person, but I think
I know it.

15
00:03:15,907 --> 00:03:17,893
Then he appeared.

16
00:03:19,292 --> 00:03:23,398
Something happens, sushoara fell!

17
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:28,181
I saw it!
With my eyes open!

18
00:03:29,204 --> 00:03:31,981
But where do you see?
Nobody here.

19
00:03:34,388 --> 00:03:36,120
Yes!
Where I saw?

20
00:03:37,952 --> 00:03:39,580
This was my vaobrazhanie.

21
00:03:40,457 --> 00:03:42,151
Why would presume
something like this?

22
00:03:43,234 --> 00:03:46,205
But I definitely saw it.

23
00:03:47,284 --> 00:03:48,629
With my own eyes!

24
00:03:49,175 --> 00:03:50,722
Stop, watch movies too!

25
00:03:51,201 --> 00:03:53,405
You must have remembered a
scene from a terrible movie.

26
00:03:53,766 --> 00:03:56,796
No, Sudan!
Never seen before!

27
00:03:58,067 --> 00:04:00,797
I must have been a dream.
Viewed dream with open eyes.

28
00:04:01,392 --> 00:04:04,086
No!
This was not a dream!

29
00:04:05,358 --> 00:04:09,454
Something will happen!
Something will happen!

30
00:04:34,679 --> 00:04:36,412
Do you Shuni?
-Tonight?

31
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:39,065
Yes, tonight.
-Will they expect.

32
00:05:01,682 --> 00:05:04,100

34
00:09:32,641 --> 00:09:35,795
So Mr Shuni, what was our idea?
An eye for an eye tooth for tooth, right?.

35
00:09:36,599 --> 00:09:37,672
Useless idea was hers.

36
00:09:38,422 --> 00:09:39,920
I have a completely different idea.
-What?

37
00:09:40,658 --> 00:09:43,754
Someday, I really
will come and you raped!.

38
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:47,712
Before you do whatever it was
will have to take my permission.

Touch my steps!-Get out!
Touch your steps, indeed!

40
00:09:51,271 --> 00:09:53,038

sister, Rama.Tova is what I will do.

No
Why, you ask?.

45
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:04,738

Do not eat as much roast

00:10:59,191 --> 00:11:03,598
This guy really loves you

66
00:11:04,226 --> 00:11:05,713
Hey, we're just friends.

00:12:00,659 --> 00:12:03,704

00:12:11,427 --> 00:12:14,063
Come Devi! Not reopen

73
00:12:14,612 --> 00:12:16,076
What you see during the day
same thing in the morning ...

74
00:12:16,436 --> 00:12:17,285

Yea I told you that

00:12:25,237 --> 00:12:26,801
Now I know this girl is Rama.

77
00:12:27,362 --> 00:12:29,038
It has a defined
concern.

78
00:12:29,706 --> 00:12:31,320
I would call on the phone
immediately!

79
00:12:31,926 --> 00:12:33,205

Ok!
But I am alive!

86
00:13:03,676 --> 00:13:05,774
Say is that if you say some
that someone will die ...

87
00:13:06,307 --> 00:13:07,725
then it will have a longer life.

88
00:13:08,718 --> 00:13:12,250
I hope God hears what you say
...

89
00:13:13,234 --> 00:13:16,079
How is uncle? Is OK
He was in Calcutta.

Oh, Sister! Why peeve?
He is my friend!

96
00:13:42,049 --> 00:13:45,060
Stop to argue and tell him
what has already told you.

97
00:13:46,481 --> 00:13:48,032
I close the phone.

98
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:57,109
Scared girl!
Are you satisfied now?

99
00:13:58,455 --> 00:14:03,931

Sudha is married.

189
00:27:19,024 --> 00:27:21,222
She is the daughter of Mr. Matur
and not Mr Duta.

190
00:27:22,569 --> 00:27:23,880
Why did you lead me to this place?

Idiot, you are given a gift

00:33:12,672 --> 00:33:14,260
If this music reaches

... then this stone will hit
your head next time! right?.

Look ... look, do not approach

Hey, baby, I Shuni.

Pochuvstvuva as though I

299
00:36:37,047 --> 00:36:39,141
Hey, when I get back from London?

300
00:36:39,515 --> 00:36:40,764
You could at least write to me.
I would come to meet you.

301
00:36:44,296 --> 00:36:47,438
But how open the door without a key.
Just as everyone makes it.

302
00:36:58,598 --> 00:37:00,720
But where you have this key?.

303
00:37:01,905 --> 00:37:04,068

306
00:37:10,417 --> 00:37:12,755
Where is uncle?
Not this day.

307
00:37:13,228 --> 00:37:14,586
He went to Puna for some
urgent work.

308
00:37:15,149 --> 00:37:16,243
He will return tomorrow.

309
00:37:17,284 --> 00:37:20,320
I heard from him for Rama.

310
00:37:21,553 --> 00:37:22,947
I still can not believe it.

311
00:37:23,823 --> 00:37:24,964
But it happened.

312
00:37:26,382 --> 00:37:28,714
It has been 5 years since
my sister disappeared.

313
00:37:30,364 --> 00:37:34,711
It will never return ...
She is dead.

314
00:37:38,368 --> 00:37:39,835
How can you say?

315
00:37:40,602 --> 00:37:45,012
Maybe it actually lost
and someday will return.

316
00:37:45,608 --> 00:37:48,621
None Shuni, this will never happen!
My dream can never be wrong.

00:37:49,348 --> 00:37:53,220
Oh, yeah? So you grief

Amazing! By the way,

00:37:58,451 --> 00:37:59,769
I still have the ring.

00:38:02,602 --> 00:38:05,516
What are your future plans?

323
00:38:11,738 --> 00:38:13,938
Vizh.Ti must create
a fuss a few days.

324
00:38:14,688 --> 00:38:15,673
Noise that?
-Yes!

325

00:38:17,827 --> 00:38:19,547
You will be my partner.

327

And it just seems so.

564
01:09:21,024 --> 01:09:23,360
This should be a statue.

565
01:09:24,602 --> 01:09:27,032

Of course, I fossilize

625
01:22:45,118 --> 01:22:46,512
They say that ...

626
01:22:46,916 --> 01:22:51,451
... spirits wandering in the wild
houses.

627
01:22:52,230 --> 01:22:53,685
And this house was uninhabitable ...

628
01:22:54,030 --> 01:22:55,657
over the past 6 years.

629
01:23:00,968 --> 01:23:02,427
this phone is also dead ...

630
01:23:02,830 --> 01:23:04,724

01:23:05,489 --> 01:23:10,024
But not pretesnyavay te.Az will
handle the phone within 2-3 days.

You are not scared, right?.

634
01:23:17,014 --> 01:23:20,914
I will do everything alone.
You leave!

635
01:23:23,100 --> 01:23:24,801
As if I want to stay
spectral in the house!

636
01:23:25,308 --> 01:23:27,466
God, please pazimadam!.
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

637
01:28:37,512 --> 01:28:39,227
Mr. Kumar and Ms. Devi ...

638
01:28:39,614 --> 01:28:41,945
... It is true that the skeleton is
was a girl.

639
01:28:42,774 --> 01:28:45,049
And according to the information the doctor
This is also true ...

640
01:28:45,849 --> 01:28:47,847
that the age of the skeleton
not more than 25 years.

641
01:28:50,195 --> 01:28:52,008
But this does not prove
that ...

642
01:28:52,492 --> 01:28:55,402
... this really a skeleton
is your setra Rama.

643
01:28:56,450 --> 01:28:59,734
How about a necklace?
-I say to her, too.

644
01:29:00,646 --> 01:29:01,747
This is not a special necklace.

645
01:29:02,133 --> 01:29:03,989
Anyone can buy them
free of bazaars.

646
01:29:08,478 --> 01:29:11,320
Here look.
I asked two of them.

647
01:29:12,038 --> 01:29:14,179
This necklace can
be a neck.

648
01:29:14,990 --> 01:29:16,518
whose necklace was
the neck of my sister ...

649
01:29:16,940 --> 01:29:18,454
... and this is on the skeleton
s the same one!

650
01:29:19,910 --> 01:29:22,062
You may be eligible ..

651
01:29:22,648 --> 01:29:23,847

654
01:29:29,202 --> 01:29:30,473
... but it was found
in my house ...

655
01:29:30,901 --> 01:29:32,204
... which was sealed
government ..

656
01:29:32,415 --> 01:29:33,242
... for the last 6 years.

657
01:29:34,601 --> 01:29:38,275
I think someone is vazpolzvuval
than it is sealed ..

658
01:29:38,852 --> 01:29:39,478
... and she was buried exactly
his house.

659
01:29:40,030 --> 01:29:41,656
I also think so.

660
01:29:42,241 --> 01:29:44,034
Believe me, Kumar
this is not anyone else ...

661
01:29:44,594 --> 01:29:46,829
... except for my sister!
She lost 5 years before.

This is the clock.
-Please stop it!

688
01:32:24,827 --> 01:32:27,061
Well ... what is your?

689
01:32:28,524 --> 01:32:30,502
Kumar, I saw all those
things again ...

690
01:32:30,913 --> 01:32:32,194
... those that I told you
before.

691
01:32:33,798 --> 01:32:36,262
How often should I tell you not to
for such useless things?

692
01:32:36,983 --> 01:32:42,139
Try very, Kumar, but what can I do?
Those things bother me posttoyanno!

693
01:32:42,863 --> 01:32:46,318
Look, look, if posttoyanno dream
such vain dreams ...

vloshi.Ne is pretesnyavay!

695
01:32:48,550 --> 01:32:49,913
I am here.

696
01:32:51,265 --> 01:32:52,670
I am here.

697
01:33:16,113 --> 01:33:17,515
Do you
this alarm clock?

698
01:33:18,504 --> 01:33:20,141
Is there anything
particularly in this?.

699
01:33:21,227 --> 01:33:25,023
Da.Kogato saw all those
things once more yesterday evening ...

700
01:33:27,525 --> 01:33:32,164
... I also heard the alarm
this clock.

701
01:33:33,305 --> 01:33:34,921
And?

702
01:33:35,600 --> 01:33:40,856
And I think that there is a link between
alarm those things?

703
01:33:43,899 --> 01:33:45,213
It needs to help you

704
01:33:46,935 --> 01:33:49,303
How can I help you in
this issue?

705
01:33:51,291 --> 01:33:54,352
I am ready to do anything
which I ask.

706
01:33:56,783 --> 01:33:59,539
Shuni, you are never
amaze ...

707
01:34:00,031 --> 01:34:01,304
... I can see
all those things?

708
01:34:02,084 --> 01:34:04,419
I was the one that found
skeleton of his sister.

709
01:34:04,933 --> 01:34:06,042
Am I right?.

710
01:34:06,430 --> 01:34:07,684
Da.Taka it!
-Right!

711
01:34:08,931 --> 01:34:12,900
... and what I can see now
will also take place.

712
01:34:13,867 --> 01:34:18,994
woman to be killed ...
and the man who will kill

713
01:34:21,062 --> 01:34:23,311
Save this woman, Shuni.
Please save her.

714
01:34:24,286 --> 01:34:27,472
Devi, even if I want to save
but must have some clue!

715
01:34:28,002 --> 01:34:30,131
I think! We will find
undoubtedly some output!.

716
01:34:33,193 --> 01:34:36,213
Repeat one more time
these things you see.

717
01:34:37,042 --> 01:34:40,278
Large broken mirror.

718
01:34:42,089 --> 01:34:43,775
cigarette Brown on peplnik.

719
01:34:45,355 --> 01:34:47,480
videotape to 100 days to write it.

720
01:34:48,981 --> 01:34:51,259
photo of a horse by its cover
the magazine called "Priya".

721
01:34:54,251 --> 01:34:55,746
statue of Jesus Christ.

722
01:34:57,723 --> 01:34:59,237
I start to worry.

723
01:35:01,838 --> 01:35:05,780
And then ... same
girl was killed.

724
01:35:06,995 --> 01:35:09,423
Only two things are certainly clear.

725
01:35:10,471 --> 01:35:15,254
First picture
horse in Priya.

726
01:35:15,994 --> 01:35:20,263
Second, a videotape on which
write 100 days.

727
01:35:22,702 --> 01:35:24,454
Let me go to the office
of "Priya".

728
01:35:24,864 --> 01:35:26,040
We will go on video
library on the way ...

729
01:35:26,434 --> 01:35:30,744
... and ask for the tape.
-Right!

730
01:35:33,808 --> 01:35:36,912

Maybe we'll find a clue.

735
01:35:47,765 --> 01:35:49,996
This is ilyuziya.No as soon as
you rest your heart.

736
01:35:50,768 --> 01:35:52,049
I will be here and if
something needs to be called.

01:35:59,745 --> 01:36:01,006
Do you have a videotape

739
01:36:02,096 --> 01:36:02,805

And do you have tapes with English film.

Yea there is no film at

745
01:36:18,420 --> 01:36:20,086
Why so many

746
01:36:30,129 --> 01:36:31,552

We want to see

753
01:36:50,337 --> 01:36:53,560
Knight? No, we have not issued
this magazine.

754
01:36:54,611 --> 01:36:57,595
You never have issued Magazine
a horse on the cover?.

755
01:36:58,176 --> 01:37:00,738
No! And there such chances
for the next 6 months.

756
01:37:01,512 --> 01:37:03,258
As for now covers 6
are reserved months ahead ...

757
01:37:03,597 --> 01:37:04,856
... and no horse.

758
01:37:05,779 --> 01:37:09,768
Please try to spomnite.Az
I think I saw this cover.

759
01:37:10,344 --> 01:37:12,832
You should have seen
this in your dreams.

760
01:37:13,394 --> 01:37:15,685
You are right, gospodine.Tova f.
that and trying to explain!

761
01:37:16,093 --> 01:37:17,346
But she did not understand a word of.

762
01:37:17,803 --> 01:37:20,835
My vyarvatei not mock me!

763
01:37:21,270 --> 01:37:22,558
But this is a matter of
life and death for someone!

764
01:37:24,147 --> 01:37:25,430
Devi, listen.

765
01:37:27,508 --> 01:37:28,733
She was angry.

766
01:37:33,615 --> 01:37:37,861
Matter of life and death!
Knight on the cover of the magazine!.

767
01:37:38,830 --> 01:37:40,761
These are symptoms of madness!

768
01:37:41,248 --> 01:37:42,249
Are not crazy.

769
01:37:43,417 --> 01:37:46,707
Called a warning.

770
01:37:47,490 --> 01:37:49,772
I can understand what is
warning, Doc.

771
01:37:50,321 --> 01:37:52,185
She has a warning
for her sister.

772
01:37:52,747 --> 01:37:54,542
It preduseshta threat to your sister!

773
01:37:55,588 --> 01:37:57,269
Let us assume
so.

774
01:37:57,700 --> 01:37:59,926
But now she sees it ...

775
01:38:00,302 --> 01:38:01,865
... and another girl who
will be killed.

776
01:38:02,264 --> 01:38:03,853
And she does not even know it!

777
01:38:05,066 --> 01:38:09,480
Is it possible to see future events
in the lives of every ...

778
01:38:09,938 --> 01:38:11,511
... and to be human?

779
01:38:12,767 --> 01:38:15,543
It may happen.

780
01:38:15,959 --> 01:38:18,887
Sometimes when we go
office ...

781
01:38:19,280 --> 01:38:22,141
... I feel like a guest
comes to us.

782
01:38:22,589 --> 01:38:24,542
And he actually came!

783
01:38:26,841 --> 01:38:29,218
There are definitely some
Power ...

784
01:38:29,747 --> 01:38:32,671
... that we predict events
that will happen with us.

785
01:38:33,593 --> 01:38:37,071
Everyone has a part
this force ..

786
01:38:37,735 --> 01:38:40,640
But some people have it
in large part ...

787
01:38:41,128 --> 01:38:45,826
... so they can clearly
perceived future events.

788
01:38:46,480 --> 01:38:47,783
I do not believe this!.

789
01:38:51,646 --> 01:38:53,224
You know once a
girl in America ...

790
01:38:54,691 --> 01:38:56,681
... before her mother to
die in a car accident?

791
01:38:57,130 --> 01:38:59,041
Her mother lived in another city ...
So the girl and calling.

792
01:38:59,509 --> 01:39:01,411
She talked to her mother
and say ...

793
01:39:01,886 --> 01:39:04,303
... does not leave
his home days

794
01:39:05,401 --> 01:39:07,784
Nobody believed the girl.

795
01:39:08,499 --> 01:39:11,745
Her mother out of his house.
and died in a car accident.

796
01:39:12,609 --> 01:39:14,727
Do you know what effect
doprenese on this girl?

797
01:39:15,377 --> 01:39:17,407
It is crazy!
-What?.

798
01:39:18,808 --> 01:39:23,001
Do so to save this woman
may be considered later.

799
01:39:23,701 --> 01:39:25,566
First, trust
what he says Devi.

800
01:39:26,030 --> 01:39:27,767
Listen carefully
understand well what he says.

801
01:39:28,131 --> 01:39:29,810
Otherwise it mozhesashto so
become victims of the madness.

802
01:40:00,967 --> 01:40:04,967
Favorite Mota will end
skoro.Shte I come in about an hour.

803
01:40:05,967 --> 01:40:07,717
Please try to come soon.
I am scared.

804
01:40:10,717 --> 01:40:12,677
Chicken!

805
01:40:14,677 --> 01:40:17,477
I will try to come
to 11 hours, okay?

806
01:45:24,477 --> 01:45:26,377
Daughter you are good, right?

807
01:45:26,377 --> 01:45:28,177
Yes.
Please sit down.

808
01:45:34,177 --> 01:45:40,327
Devi, yeah I find that
body of Rama ...

809
01:45:42,327 --> 01:45:44,477
Let's true
Oh, God!

810
01:45:47,477 --> 01:45:49,027
I can not even be
presents ...

811
01:45:49,027 --> 01:45:53,977
... that she would die from
such a horrible death.

812
01:45:54,977 --> 01:45:58,477
I'm laden for you
baby.

813
01:45:58,477 --> 01:46:02,277
That is why we back
once received telegram.

814
01:46:04,277 --> 01:46:07,927
Now when I get back.
Everything will be fine.

815
01:46:10,927 --> 01:46:15,777
But who can be killed
Rama?

816
01:46:16,777 --> 01:46:18,077
Police suspect someone?

817
01:46:18,077 --> 01:46:21,227
They are still investigating the murder.

818
01:46:23,227 --> 01:46:26,527
Uncle, you know something
especially for Rama?.

819
01:46:28,527 --> 01:46:33,427
It will never time these
its research and images.

820
01:47:20,427 --> 01:47:22,727
Why so suddenly asked
To visit the museum?

821
01:47:22,727 --> 01:47:26,527
I found some pictures
this museum ...

822
01:47:26,527 --> 01:47:29,977
... in the old cabinet of my sister.

823
01:47:29,977 --> 01:47:32,027
She studied ancient idols!

824
01:47:32,027 --> 01:47:34,277
She came here to learn
for them and made notes.

825
01:47:34,277 --> 01:47:35,677
But what will we look here?

826
01:47:35,677 --> 01:47:40,577
I have no idea. I thought
we can find some clue here.

827
01:47:41,577 --> 01:47:44,077
Maybe this place has
connection with the murder of my sister.

828
01:48:29,077 --> 01:48:30,877
Sorry.
-Tell?.

829
01:48:31,877 --> 01:48:32,977
This box is empty why?.

830
01:48:32,977 --> 01:48:36,027
Madame, why are interested in the empty box,
in this great museum you can see everything?

831
01:48:36,027 --> 01:48:39,327
There are many other elements.
Go and look.

832
01:48:39,327 --> 01:48:42,577
Yes, but first tell me
why this box is empty?

833
01:48:42,577 --> 01:48:43,677
What question is that?

834
01:48:43,677 --> 01:48:46,927
What can I say about
box which no image?

835
01:48:46,927 --> 01:48:51,377
Police investigation continues.
Police investigation?

836
01:48:51,377 --> 01:48:55,177
Da.Tozi image was sent
in London for the exhibition.

837
01:48:55,177 --> 01:49:00,727
But he disappeared from the museum.
Mace was of pure gold.

838
01:49:00,727 --> 01:49:03,277
And had a chance
was that image?

839
01:49:03,277 --> 01:49:07,477
Strange! How get
this picture with you?

840
01:49:08,477 --> 01:49:10,877
Because this image, one of
security, Zhagmoan ...

841
01:49:10,877 --> 01:49:13,727
... and the Registrar of the Museum
Parvati were fired.

842
01:49:13,727 --> 01:49:17,527
If there regestriran
against them.

843
01:49:17,527 --> 01:49:19,577
Dzhagmoan and Parvati?

844
01:49:20,577 --> 01:49:21,527
How old is Parvati?

845
01:49:21,527 --> 01:49:22,527
About 30 years.

846
01:49:22,527 --> 01:49:26,927
Can you give me the addresses
of Dzhagmoan and Parvati?

847
01:49:27,927 --> 01:49:30,277
No! Do not know, but it is not
lie!

848
01:49:30,277 --> 01:49:36,227
This may not
your duty, but ...

849
01:49:37,327 --> 01:49:38,167
100 RUPEN!

850
01:49:40,167 --> 01:49:45,867
Madame, I can do and
horoscopes for the money!

851
01:49:45,867 --> 01:49:48,017
Give me a sheet of paper
I will write their addresses.

852
01:49:51,017 --> 01:49:53,817
Be careful.
-Why?

853
01:49:55,817 --> 01:49:57,317
Dzhagmoan is a very special man.

854
01:49:57,317 --> 01:50:00,867
It is irritating from the smallest
cause and began to fight.

855
01:50:02,867 --> 01:50:03,067
Here take.

856
01:50:08,067 --> 01:50:10,417
So I saw in my dream
namely Dzhagmoan and Parvati.

857
01:50:12,417 --> 01:50:14,017
Should meet with them.
-Let 's go.

858

And I had to learn today that

... but first he gives

1045
02:23:53,507 --> 02:23:55,607
I will tell you everything.

1046
02:23:56,607 --> 02:24:01,607
Please give me a chance
zashtitya.Molya to you!

1047
02:24:09,607 --> 02:24:10,957
My childhood was
very easy.

1048
02:24:11,957 --> 02:24:15,507
While not so ...

1049
02:24:15,507 --> 02:24:18,557
... Dad lost all his
money in gambling.

1050
02:24:18,557 --> 02:24:22,907
In which he forced
To set this house too.

1051
02:24:22,907 --> 02:24:24,557
I am looking for help
my family ...

1052
02:24:24,557 --> 02:24:28,807
but all I did.

1053
02:24:29,807 --> 02:24:33,457
I had to fight
for every penny.

1054
02:24:33,457 --> 02:24:37,157
At the same time
my father is gone from this earth.

1055
02:24:37,157 --> 02:24:41,207
Nobody even gave me no
loan to bury.

1056
02:24:42,207 --> 02:24:48,057
I realized that one price
only when he is rich.

1057
02:24:48,057 --> 02:24:53,507
Thereafter.
I met with Dzhagmoan ...

1058
02:24:53,507 --> 02:24:56,507
who worked as
security in the museum.

1059
02:24:57,507 --> 02:25:02,457
View all old antiques there.
In my heart was born very greed.

1060
02:25:03,457 --> 02:25:09,457
I started to sell the idols of
here a high price abroad.

1061
02:25:11,457 --> 02:25:14,457
Me and Dzhagmoan kradyahme
real elements of the museum ...

1062
02:25:14,457 --> 02:25:15,007
and replace them with false

1063
02:25:16,007 --> 02:25:20,457
Very soon Parvati, was kyato

1064
02:25:20,457 --> 02:25:21,607

1065
02:25:22,607 --> 02:25:28,507
Soon, the business began to flourished,
I become a millionaire.

1066
02:25:28,507 --> 02:25:32,257
Your sister, Rama, used to
came to write on them.

1067
02:25:32,257 --> 02:25:35,907
She knew the difference between
true or false

1068
02:25:35,907 --> 02:25:39,257
It zyapodozrya and quiet
quietly started to follow us.

1069
02:25:40,257 --> 02:25:43,107
And one days, she knew everything
for our work.

1070
02:25:43,107 --> 02:25:47,507
I tried to bribe her, but
she did not accept parite.I then ...

1071

But please believe me

1076
02:26:06,357 --> 02:26:08,557
What do you mean that
the tape was tampered with ...

1077
02:26:08,557 --> 02:26:10,107
... or that I am lying?.

1078
02:26:10,107 --> 02:26:12,057
None of the two.

If you do not leave anything
this will be good for you.

1086
02:26:27,457 --> 02:26:29,757

I would stress and d
her to close the mouth.

1093
02:26:54,307 --> 02:26:56,007
It did not scare.

1094

And if she informed the police,
will svashi!.

1095

1112
02:27:53,207 --> 02:27:57,857
Therefore, it killed
