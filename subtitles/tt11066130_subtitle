1
00:00:15,041 --> 00:00:16,166
This wasn't part of the plan.

2
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:18,041
Relax, man, nothing will happen. Come.

3
00:00:18,125 --> 00:00:20,208
Keep quiet. We'll get caught.

4
00:00:20,291 --> 00:00:21,250
Just saying this wasn't part of the plan.

5
00:00:21,333 --> 00:00:22,791
Just climb, man.

6
00:00:22,875 --> 00:00:24,791
Is it Vaishano Devi temple
that I should climb man climb?

7
00:00:24,875 --> 00:00:26,666
-Come fast.
-Climb up.

8
00:00:27,208 --> 00:00:30,500
-Just climb up.
-Kapil, give me a hand.

9
00:00:30,875 --> 00:00:32,083
Hurry up.

10
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:33,125
Never climbed a tree?

11
00:00:33,208 --> 00:00:34,375
Why would I ever climb a tree?
Are you crazy?

12
00:00:34,458 --> 00:00:35,416
Sorry.

13
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:42,750
Careful, man.

14
00:00:55,708 --> 00:00:57,333
Where is she?

15
00:00:58,166 --> 00:00:59,666
-Where is she?
-She'll be here.

16
00:01:02,416 --> 00:01:03,833
There she is.

17
00:01:05,041 --> 00:01:06,083
Hi.

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,083
-Hurry up.
-Hurry up.

19
00:01:11,458 --> 00:01:13,500
-There's a problem.
-What?

20
00:01:16,291 --> 00:01:17,750
The bag is too heavy.

21
00:01:18,166 --> 00:01:20,750
-Leave it.
-No, I need it.

22
00:01:20,833 --> 00:01:22,083
-Leave it.
-Leave the bag.

23
00:01:22,166 --> 00:01:23,583
No, I can't leave without it.

24
00:01:23,916 --> 00:01:25,250
-Let her throw it down.
-Please, man.

25
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:29,208
-Throw it down.
-Fine. Throw it down.

26
00:01:33,416 --> 00:01:35,166
Oh, shit.

27
00:01:35,291 --> 00:01:36,125
He's awake.

28
00:01:36,208 --> 00:01:37,041
-What do we do?
-Who's there?

29
00:01:37,375 --> 00:01:39,666
-Forget the rope. Use the main door.
-What do we do?

30
00:01:40,083 --> 00:01:41,916
The lights are on!

31
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,000
He's coming here.

32
00:01:44,083 --> 00:01:45,916
-Pick up the bag.
-Bag?

33
00:01:46,375 --> 00:01:47,500
No...

34
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,833
Throw...

35
00:01:50,291 --> 00:01:53,166
-Grab his legs.
-I can't.

36
00:01:54,083 --> 00:01:55,875
-Please forgive us.
-Sorry, Uncle.

37
00:01:55,958 --> 00:01:56,791
Don't let go.

38
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,875
Richa, hurry up.

39
00:01:59,833 --> 00:02:00,875
Run!

40
00:02:01,041 --> 00:02:02,708
Just run.

41
00:02:02,916 --> 00:02:04,083
-Sure?
-Run!

42
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:05,625
-Run!
-Uncle, please calm down.

43
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:06,541
Run!

44
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,541
-He's too heavy.
-Pin him down.

45
00:02:08,625 --> 00:02:10,041
Richa, what are you doing?

46
00:02:10,125 --> 00:02:12,583
-What is she doing?
-Leave the bag. Run.

47
00:02:12,708 --> 00:02:13,833
-One second.
-Get off me!

48
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:24,416
No, no, Uncle.

49
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,791
Please, no. Sorry.

50
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,708
What is this?

51
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,083
Load it up.

52
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,125
Uncle, we...

53
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:33,250
-You--
-Stay put.

54
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:36,333
How did our innocent little girl
end up with that guy!

55
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:39,625
He's not a bad guy.
He's a computer engineer.

56
00:02:39,875 --> 00:02:43,125
Aren't you guys taught
to stay within your limits?

57
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:44,916
It's loaded, right?

58
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:46,791
He is a good guy, uncle...

59
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:49,041
He's a manager in a big IT company.

60
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:50,208
Manager?

61
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,000
We employ managers here...

62
00:02:52,083 --> 00:02:53,750
-Not bring them home as grooms.
-Understood?

63
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,875
That's not all.

64
00:02:56,875 --> 00:02:58,666
-He will soon become the CEO.
-What?

65
00:02:58,791 --> 00:02:59,625
The CEO.

66
00:02:59,708 --> 00:03:01,458
We're planning a startup together.

67
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:02,666
-Shut up.
-Hang on!

68
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:04,583
This is the age of startups.

69
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:07,458
This phone, in your hand.
That's the new world now.

70
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:10,041
Soon our App will be
on every mobile phone.

71
00:03:10,125 --> 00:03:12,208
We're talking millions, even billions.

72
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:14,541
Uncle, your daughter will rule the world.

73
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:16,291
What nonsense.

74
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:17,833
-No...
-Wait.

75
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:21,958
Hold this.

76
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:23,208
-Yes?
-Please shut up.

77
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:25,166
He'll kill us.

78
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:27,500
As long as I'm talking we're alive, right?

79
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,833
Fine.

80
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,666
Billions, huh?

81
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:37,791
-Get lost.
-What?

82
00:03:37,916 --> 00:03:39,416
-Get out, or else...
-OK.

83
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,416
Her father won.

84
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,208
So that's why they let us go.

85
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:34,166
That stupid bag.

86
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:36,583
We should have known.

87
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:40,416
A girl who wouldn't even leave her bag,
would never leave her father.

88
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,375
-Correct?
-Right.

89
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:44,375
You never told us
how dangerous her father is.

90
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:46,541
You wouldn't have come then.

91
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:48,833
I see, Loverboy,
you get the girl, we get shot?

92
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:50,833
'Happy ending' for you, 'the end' for us?

93
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:53,916
-Lucky there were no bullets...
-Exactly.

94
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:56,458
-We'd be dead right now.
-Rascals.

95
00:04:56,916 --> 00:04:59,791
-Don't friends help a guy elope?
-Right. Elope.

96
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:04,083
We should do something in this.

97
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,375
-Oh God.
-Just listen.

98
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:08,541
There are so many matrimony apps.

99
00:05:08,916 --> 00:05:11,708
We'll start RunAwayMarriage.com.
An elopement service.

100
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:17,333
From luggage to legal hassles,
we take care of it all.

101
00:05:17,541 --> 00:05:18,500
There he goes again.

102
00:05:19,458 --> 00:05:20,291
Listen...

103
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,458
My parents were overjoyed when I was born.

104
00:05:43,791 --> 00:05:44,833
I don't know why.

105
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:47,500
As I grew up, I proved to be worthless.

106
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,125
My parents were unhappy.

107
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:51,083
I dropped out of college.

108
00:05:51,541 --> 00:05:53,416
I couldn't excel in studies nor sports.

109
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,833
My parents were very unhappy.

110
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:58,166
living off others, deep in debt,

111
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:01,291
borrowed house, borrowed booze,
a borrowed laptop.

112
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:03,000
After college...

113
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:06,208
friends don't lend you money
and banks aren't your buddies.

114
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:08,000
That's how I got the idea for..

115
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:09,541
DostiUdhaar.com.

116
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:17,291
Now, DostiUdhaar.com is
one of India's top fintech startups,

117
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:19,500
with a valuation of 1.2 billion rupees.

118
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:21,333
My share is worth 300 million.

119
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:24,750
Money, fame, cars, houses. I have it all.

120
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,083
But my father is still unhappy.

121
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:32,125
He wants to know why investors
are pumping in all this money.

122
00:06:36,791 --> 00:06:37,791
When you were born...

123
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:39,791
Where are you going?

124
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:41,541
-What's wrong with him?
-No idea.

125
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:42,500
Why?

126
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:46,875
This.

127
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:49,333
Here comes Mr. Big Shot.

128
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,625
-Hope.
-You should really start charging him now.

129
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:54,125
-You are calling him here?
-Where will he sit?

130
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,125
Mother Teresa, shift.

131
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,916
You got late?

132
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:04,375
-Liqueur chocolates. From Hong Kong.
-Great.

133
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:07,875
If you are not selling soap, cola
or insurance after college...

134
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:10,833
start your own small company.

135
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:15,000
As long as you represent hope,

136
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:17,291
you are the king.

137
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:20,291
For your investors, you're hope.

138
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:23,250
For your employees, you're hope.

139
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:28,208
You hope that your app goes viral.

140
00:07:39,791 --> 00:07:42,583
So, let's see who our next hope is.

141
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:55,750
Join us now, as the CTO.

142
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:57,666
-We're doing something together.
-Really?

143
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:00,833
It's been three years since we graduated,
the world still hasn't changed a bit.

144
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:15,208
Chinese food with Indian?

145
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:19,333
It's the best combination in the world.
You won't even find this in China.

146
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:22,791
You are nuts.

147
00:08:23,958 --> 00:08:26,333
People obsess about weight loss,
you eat this junk.

148
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,625
Elon Musk is going to Mars.

149
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:30,708
Zuckerberg is exploring VR.

150
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:33,208
And you're starting a suicide helpline?

151
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:35,166
Everyone wants to change the world
in their own way.

152
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:36,625
I do too.

153
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:40,000
I also want to do something meaningful.

154
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:42,500
Then do it instead of criticizing me.

155
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:45,083
You can't change the world just like that.

156
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:47,666
Not as long as you're doing it
on a small scale.

157
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:49,416
Look at my mom's NGO.

158
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,250
All those years of work,
what good did that do?

159
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:53,625
The poor didn't get rich.
We definitely got poorer.

160
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:57,291
The biggest problem is

161
00:08:57,375 --> 00:08:59,000
there's no profit in social service.

162
00:08:59,291 --> 00:09:01,666
Start with service,
the profit will follow.

163
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,208
I want both.

164
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,625
Work like yours,
with Mr. Big Shot's lifestyle.

165
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:07,041
Seen his girlfriend?

166
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:09,041
He has a girlfriend?

167
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:10,291
He's not like you.

168
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:13,666
You can't even talk to any girl
other than me.

169
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:16,041
Come on.

170
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:18,875
Don't tease me.

171
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:21,083
I'm struggling for ideas.

172
00:09:22,791 --> 00:09:23,750
What shall I do?

173
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:25,666
You can't have everything.

174
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:29,500
That doesn't mean you give up trying.
That's a lame excuse.

175
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:31,916
You win some, you lose some.

176
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:34,000
Everything else is a bonus.

177
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:37,416
Not going to work?

178
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:41,458
No, it's Saturday.
I'm going to the village camp.

179
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,625
-I can't find my underwear.
-So?

180
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:47,666
-If you're free, look for it.
-Like we have nothing better to do?

181
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:50,250
What do you do,
other than mope about Richa?

182
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:51,833
Yeah, man, it's been four months.

183
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:53,333
Come on, man, move on.

184
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:55,583
Let's do something.
Let's brainstorm, guys.

185
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:57,416
That's all we've done since we met.

186
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,958
Even on our deathbeds, we'll be doing it.

187
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:02,166
Exactly, so quit brainstorming
and look for my underwear.

188
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:03,833
Are you wearing them?

189
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:05,500
-Don't irritate me.
-Let me see.

190
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:07,458
Got to go to work.
Show me which one you're underwear.

191
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:09,083
Hey. Listen.

192
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:11,250
Wi-Fi enabled RFID chips for clothes.

193
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:12,791
Installed right here.

194
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:14,416
Imagine that.

195
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,666
Your phone tracks where your underwear is.

196
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,458
It tracks where you took it off,
where you put it back on.

197
00:10:20,666 --> 00:10:21,750
It's a terrible idea.

198
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,416
Terrible? Why?

199
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,000
If Richa was here,
she'd be using the app on you.

200
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:28,041
She was the possessive type.

201
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:31,875
Guys, I've been thinking
on my own all morning.

202
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:34,750
But now that we're together,
the ideas are just flowing.

203
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:37,500
So, if we search together,
I'll find my underwear.

204
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:39,208
-Please look for it.
-Oh, come on.

205
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:40,708
If so, I should have got Richa.

206
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:41,875
You will.

207
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:44,166
We were unprepared last time.
Let's go again.

208
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,500
Why?

209
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:47,375
Did you go to an eloping boot camp?

210
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:49,291
Look, I don't need that much action.

211
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:51,041
You know,

212
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:54,750
that was the most action I got
in our ten-year romance.

213
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,666
You'll find someone else.

214
00:10:58,166 --> 00:11:01,500
If Richa has a son, she'll name him Vinay.

215
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:03,166
No.

216
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:05,458
Don't worry. We'll get our revenge.

217
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:08,125
If one of us has a daughter,
we'll name her Richa.

218
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,375
Idiots.

219
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:11,958
See?

220
00:11:12,583 --> 00:11:16,208
Missing underwear, terrible app ideas,
awesome friends.

221
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:17,833
What else do you need?

222
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:46,875
My chest is hurting.

223
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:50,166
Water!

224
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:52,166
Water!

225
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:56,500
Did you look everywhere?

226
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:57,750
I can't find it anywhere.

227
00:11:57,833 --> 00:11:59,458
What about last week's stock?

228
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:02,500
Pay attention. Don't repeat this.

229
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:05,875
Understand? Don't let it happen again.
Didn't I teach you this already?

230
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:09,750
I don't know. Perhaps next week.

231
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:12,583
This injection is not available
in the village.

232
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:24,708
It's out of stock here too.

233
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,041
What is it, man?

234
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:08,250
Sorry, man.

235
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:10,416
I wish I'd answered earlier.

236
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:18,208
This happens only in India.

237
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:22,625
Life-saving injections are delivered
just once in two weeks.

238
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:25,208
And just one box.

239
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:36,166
Although it cost a man his life...

240
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:39,375
Kapil did finally impress a girl.

241
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:43,208
This is India.

242
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:46,791
We have phones and networks,
but we don't have medicines.

243
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:49,916
You go on Saturdays.

244
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:51,875
Take some medicines with you.

245
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,875
What if there's an emergency on Friday?

246
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:55,208
Water.

247
00:13:55,291 --> 00:13:57,458
Make a WhatsApp group
of frequent travelers.

248
00:13:57,541 --> 00:14:00,416
Post the names of required medicines.
Someone will pick them up.

249
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:03,958
Listen.

250
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:08,750
We have phones and networks,
but we don't have medicines.

251
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:10,500
An Uber for medicines.

252
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:13,041
No.

253
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:17,458
Like Uber or Ola.
They don't own or drive the cars.

254
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:19,083
They're just a go-between. A medium.

255
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:22,916
But with Uber, the driver goes
to the passenger in a car.

256
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,666
The chemist won't go to the patient.

257
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,125
Remember what he said?

258
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:28,041
"Take the medicines with you on Saturday."

259
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:33,583
Hire cheap labor.
Set up twice-daily deliveries.

260
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:36,125
-Create a tracking app.
-There's no need to hire anyone.

261
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:39,250
Many commute to the city daily.
Workers, traders, laborers.

262
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:40,416
They can carry the medicines.

263
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,458
-That's right.
-Right?

264
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:44,125
-But why would they do it?
-Why not? They'll save someone's life.

265
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:45,875
We reimburse their fare.

266
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:47,541
Who will?

267
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,083
And why?

268
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:51,333
-Initially, we'll give them an incentive.
-OK.

269
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:54,916
As demand grows,
users will be charged a small fee.

270
00:14:55,416 --> 00:14:56,541
-Yes.
-Isn't it a great idea?

271
00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:57,833
I think so.

272
00:14:58,541 --> 00:14:59,875
The coding will be simple.

273
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:02,041
-Requirement here, pickup there...
-OK.

274
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:03,583
The rest is all offline.

275
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:06,958
Build a simple prototype.
Let's do a test run.

276
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:09,458
I'll gather some boys,
you find some travelers, Vinay.

277
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:11,833
Gulzar wrote a song.

278
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:13,750
"I left those streets behind."

279
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:15,875
Oh, come on. Get over the girl.

280
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,333
-Move on!
-No, man.

281
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:22,041
Ambitions, desire, attachment...

282
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:24,791
-They are not for me.
-What nonsense.

283
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:26,833
Aren't we doing this together?

284
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:28,166
It's a good idea.

285
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:29,583
You guys do it.

286
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:31,416
Don't do it.

287
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:35,916
Srivastav, I thought
your son was very intelligent.

288
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:37,583
Son, it's a stupid idea.

289
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:40,916
Your customers are poor, sick villagers.

290
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,458
How much will they pay? Peanuts, maybe.

291
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:44,750
We won't charge patients.

292
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:46,000
Yeah.

293
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:48,041
Then how will you make money?

294
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:51,041
Once the app is up and running,
we'll find a way.

295
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:55,333
You'll start a business first,
then figure out how to make money?

296
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:58,416
-Will you fund it yourself till then?
-Only in the beginning.

297
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,916
Later, the VCs will fund it.

298
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:02,500
-VC?
-Venture Capitalists.

299
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:03,500
Investors.

300
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,416
-These days people invest in ideas.
-Yeah.

301
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,541
Investors?

302
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:11,333
You earn nothing, you sell nothing.

303
00:16:12,833 --> 00:16:14,833
-Sounds shady.
-No, Dad.

304
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:18,291
There's nothing shady about it.
It's like the apps on the phone.

305
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:19,916
You use them too. They work.

306
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,333
Son, there's a public toilet there.

307
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,583
People use it. It works.

308
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:27,250
But no one would invest in it.

309
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,041
You have a good job. You have stability.

310
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:34,500
Don't take risks with a startup.

311
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:35,541
It's your call.

312
00:16:35,791 --> 00:16:38,541
-Raju, let's take a look at the lubricant.
-OK, sir.

313
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:41,500
Dad, it's...

314
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:46,416
Thing is, I...

315
00:16:46,916 --> 00:16:49,750
Son, listen to all opinions,
but make your own decisions.

316
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:56,916
I have something to tell you.

317
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,541
It's not a big deal.

318
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:01,666
At my medical checkup,

319
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:05,208
they found symptoms
of Parkinson's Disease.

320
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:07,625
Didn't Grandpa have it?

321
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:12,750
But don't worry about it.
You focus on your startup.

322
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:15,250
You want to do it, right?

323
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:16,833
Then do it!

324
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:18,916
I am with you. OK?

325
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:23,125
Why would I worry when Kapil is with you?

326
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:43,791
That's the money we had saved
for your wedding gift.

327
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:49,208
You know what, we're going to make it big.

328
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:51,125
I'll taking the day off tomorrow.

329
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:53,083
-What?
-You should too.

330
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:55,083
And you...

331
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,250
-Forget it.
-See?

332
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,375
Even Yash is taking the day off.

333
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:02,458
Come on, man. What are you doing?

334
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:05,041
Doing it together is half the fun.

335
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:08,666
Forget it, Kapil. Look at this.

336
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:10,208
Yeah!

337
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:15,041
-Isn't it?
-Yes. Looking nice.

338
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:17,083
-Is it live?
-Yes, it is.

339
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:20,125
Design looks great too.

340
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:22,541
Looks good.

341
00:18:23,291 --> 00:18:27,708
You just log in, order your medicines
and they will soon be delivered.

342
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:36,375
OK, let me show me show you our page.

343
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:37,625
The app's pretty simple.

344
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:40,083
Here's the login button.

345
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:41,666
Click on it...

346
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:45,083
-Wait.
-Don't leave.

347
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,666
Sir, don't leave.

348
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:49,833
Yeah, Carry Karo...

349
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:56,125
Ma'am, one moment.

350
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:04,291
-I can't understand any of that.
-Medicine from the city for the sick.

351
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:08,750
-Look here, it's easy to order medicine.
-No thanks, sir.

352
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:10,791
-Just check it out.
-Not interested.

353
00:19:13,416 --> 00:19:14,333
What's this?

354
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:19,916
Nice.

355
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:40,875
Don't blame me
if your customers are idiots.

356
00:19:42,208 --> 00:19:43,333
Have you seen the app?

357
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:45,750
The passport form is simpler.

358
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:48,291
Spare us the speech. We'll handle this.

359
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:50,916
Focus on your inner peace and your carrot.

360
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:54,583
I don't know.

361
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:57,500
Just try it.

362
00:19:57,791 --> 00:19:59,041
Why is that button there?

363
00:19:59,291 --> 00:20:00,500
I put it there.

364
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,166
Show me the design template code.

365
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:06,833
-Forget it.
-Just show me.

366
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:09,250
-Let me handle it.
-Wait a second.

367
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:13,166
Come. Sit.

368
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:20,791
Here, you eat the carrot.

369
00:20:44,791 --> 00:20:46,791
Look here.

370
00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:23,958
We are getting orders.

371
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:28,875
We're getting orders. Come, look.

372
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:31,166
We're getting orders.

373
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:33,541
You were amazing.

374
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:37,416
Four orders already. How did you do it?

375
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,833
-The orders are pouring in.
-It's a miracle.

376
00:21:39,916 --> 00:21:41,875
-Fine.
-Look.

377
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:45,250
-OK, man. What are you doing?
-We should worship him.

378
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:46,416
What the heck?

379
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:47,916
Enough, guys.

380
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,416
Please, listen.

381
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,625
We're getting orders now.
Come on, join us.

382
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:55,083
-Say yes.
-OK.

383
00:21:57,541 --> 00:21:59,416
But, wait.

384
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:00,916
On one condition.

385
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:03,875
-Hear me out first.
-OK.

386
00:22:09,791 --> 00:22:11,083
It has to be chilled out.

387
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:15,916
No fighting.

388
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:20,083
As you wish, O Wise One.

389
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:25,875
You know, Kapil...

390
00:22:27,125 --> 00:22:28,666
my son loves tennis.

391
00:22:30,208 --> 00:22:31,541
He's the school champion.

392
00:22:31,833 --> 00:22:33,166
But he knows...

393
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:38,041
if he doesn't do well in his exams,
his tennis will stop.

394
00:22:38,458 --> 00:22:39,708
He has to manage both.

395
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:42,750
He has to study and follow his passion.

396
00:22:43,208 --> 00:22:44,541
Sir, I'm sorry, but...

397
00:22:44,666 --> 00:22:47,916
Your son won't be a college topper,
nor a tennis champion.

398
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,583
It's hard to sleep when you're starving.

399
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,083
But...

400
00:22:58,333 --> 00:22:59,333
I've eaten enough.

401
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,416
I've slept enough.

402
00:23:04,375 --> 00:23:05,500
What can I say then?

403
00:23:07,541 --> 00:23:08,916
Go, Kapil, go.

404
00:23:10,083 --> 00:23:11,041
Live your life.

405
00:23:15,583 --> 00:23:16,458
What now?

406
00:23:16,541 --> 00:23:18,458
This time, I'm charging a counseling fee.

407
00:23:18,666 --> 00:23:20,416
Social work too, profit too.

408
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:22,750
Meet me at the hospital cafeteria.
My treat.

409
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,458
-I quit my job to enter the medical world.
-You quit?

410
00:23:26,791 --> 00:23:27,833
I quit.

411
00:23:35,166 --> 00:23:37,708
Use this app, and the medicine
will come to your door.

412
00:23:41,125 --> 00:23:42,416
Really? Will it come?

413
00:23:43,416 --> 00:23:44,458
Yes. Look.

414
00:24:35,125 --> 00:24:36,666
Wow, we have so many orders.

415
00:24:37,166 --> 00:24:38,625
But we'll need more servers.

416
00:24:39,125 --> 00:24:40,125
It will crash.

417
00:24:40,583 --> 00:24:42,000
-What?
-It's going to crash.

418
00:24:43,708 --> 00:24:44,541
Tea, sir.

419
00:24:45,541 --> 00:24:47,375
We need to buy vegetables.

420
00:24:49,458 --> 00:24:51,125
I am out of money.

421
00:24:52,083 --> 00:24:54,375
It's OK, we won't eat today.

422
00:24:55,208 --> 00:24:57,291
We have to pay the laundry guy.

423
00:24:57,375 --> 00:25:00,125
We won't wear any clothes either.

424
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:02,833
I want my salary in advance.

425
00:25:03,375 --> 00:25:05,375
-How about shares in our company?
-What?

426
00:25:06,875 --> 00:25:08,791
Where will we find the money?

427
00:25:08,875 --> 00:25:10,250
Some company!

428
00:25:14,333 --> 00:25:16,166
It detects the user's mood.

429
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:20,416
If the AI believes
the user is slipping into a depression,

430
00:25:20,541 --> 00:25:23,375
it can quietly alert his family
and his doctor.

431
00:25:37,208 --> 00:25:38,541
You think that I...

432
00:25:50,291 --> 00:25:51,458
Are you OK?

433
00:25:57,666 --> 00:25:59,375
Impressive growth.

434
00:26:01,666 --> 00:26:03,083
This is just the beginning.

435
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:13,041
What if the medicine delivered
via your app is fake, and someone dies?

436
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:16,083
Can the family sue you?

437
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:30,041
You know that, don't you?

438
00:26:30,916 --> 00:26:32,708
You are in the business
of supplying medicines, aren't you?

439
00:26:35,541 --> 00:26:37,666
We deliver medicines. We don't sell them.

440
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:39,708
Then maybe,

441
00:26:40,041 --> 00:26:44,458
CarryKaro.com could deliver soap,
toothpaste, shampoo too?

442
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,458
We want to focus on medicines.

443
00:26:50,791 --> 00:26:54,000
I mean, our focus will be medicines.

444
00:27:07,166 --> 00:27:08,208
We looked like idiots.

445
00:27:08,875 --> 00:27:10,458
-Why do you--
-It's alright.

446
00:27:10,541 --> 00:27:12,500
Mr. Big Shot's questions
caught us off guard.

447
00:27:12,875 --> 00:27:13,708
It happens.

448
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,125
Let's make a rule.

449
00:27:16,208 --> 00:27:18,416
Finance and business-related questions
are mine.

450
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:21,000
You handle operations.
You handle technical matters.

451
00:27:24,708 --> 00:27:25,708
Stop making faces.

452
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,750
Drink up. In ten days
we can't even afford this.

453
00:27:28,833 --> 00:27:31,708
If we drink this for ten days,
we won't even be alive.

454
00:27:34,041 --> 00:27:35,208
That's fine.

455
00:27:35,666 --> 00:27:37,583
But can't you do something,

456
00:27:37,708 --> 00:27:39,958
where people bring things
from villages to cities?

457
00:28:03,166 --> 00:28:05,291
Someone wants to speak to you. One moment.

458
00:28:08,375 --> 00:28:10,708
-Sir, thanks a lot.
-Say thank you.

459
00:28:13,416 --> 00:28:14,750
Thank you very much, sir.

460
00:28:14,875 --> 00:28:17,416
He has been ill for two months.

461
00:28:17,625 --> 00:28:19,583
You've given him a new lease of life.

462
00:28:19,666 --> 00:28:20,625
Thank you, sir.

463
00:28:59,458 --> 00:29:02,083
You know, my son didn't do too well
in his exams,

464
00:29:03,375 --> 00:29:05,416
but I didn't stop his tennis.

465
00:29:12,208 --> 00:29:13,291
I got wiped out, sir.

466
00:29:14,458 --> 00:29:15,291
It happens.

467
00:29:19,291 --> 00:29:20,291
How about a US stint?

468
00:29:21,666 --> 00:29:22,708
Travel the world.

469
00:29:22,791 --> 00:29:23,916
Get paid in dollars.

470
00:29:25,791 --> 00:29:27,333
Try again in a few years.

471
00:29:34,375 --> 00:29:35,208
I lost.

472
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:36,833
To whom?

473
00:29:37,625 --> 00:29:39,625
-Don't be such a drama queen.
-Spare me.

474
00:29:39,916 --> 00:29:41,291
Does it even matter to you?

475
00:29:42,083 --> 00:29:43,250
I am going to the US.

476
00:29:45,416 --> 00:29:47,083
If it mattered, I would've told you,

477
00:29:47,166 --> 00:29:49,166
"Look Kapil, you'll find another idea."

478
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,583
And if it mattered to you,
you'd listen to me.

479
00:29:52,041 --> 00:29:54,458
But what you really want
along with beaches,

480
00:29:54,541 --> 00:29:57,333
dollars and white chicks,
is just sympathy.

481
00:29:57,416 --> 00:29:58,458
Oh, forget it.

482
00:29:59,083 --> 00:30:00,041
What?

483
00:30:00,333 --> 00:30:01,750
Is anyone forcing you to go?

484
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:05,125
Don't go.

485
00:30:07,541 --> 00:30:08,500
It's not that easy.

486
00:30:09,125 --> 00:30:11,291
You want everything.

487
00:30:11,375 --> 00:30:12,875
And you want it to be easy too.

488
00:30:15,583 --> 00:30:16,583
Forget it.

489
00:30:22,291 --> 00:30:25,208
Even I lost those funding competitions
along with you, Kapil.

490
00:30:28,125 --> 00:30:29,458
Mine is a different ballgame.

491
00:30:30,041 --> 00:30:31,541
"Marriage" and "kids."

492
00:30:34,458 --> 00:30:36,958
But I'm still standing here.
Still fighting, right?

493
00:30:49,208 --> 00:30:50,208
Forget all of this.

494
00:30:51,625 --> 00:30:53,916
To each his own.

495
00:30:54,708 --> 00:30:56,541
You could return whenever you like.

496
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:16,500
Why did DostiUdhaar fire you?

497
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:19,416
Even Steve Jobs was fired from Apple.

498
00:31:19,833 --> 00:31:21,666
What are your plans for the future?

499
00:31:23,125 --> 00:31:24,291
Nothing concrete yet.

500
00:31:24,708 --> 00:31:26,125
I'm getting wedding proposals.

501
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:27,333
I might get married.

502
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:33,916
Do you know him?

503
00:31:34,416 --> 00:31:35,250
No.

504
00:31:36,083 --> 00:31:37,458
He visited my college once.

505
00:31:39,375 --> 00:31:40,250
Which college?

506
00:31:41,416 --> 00:31:42,250
Harvard.

507
00:31:44,125 --> 00:31:44,958
Harvard.

508
00:31:45,958 --> 00:31:47,208
I'm headed to the US too.

509
00:31:49,041 --> 00:31:51,791
Going to Chennai for the visa interview.

510
00:31:52,875 --> 00:31:54,208
I just returned from the US.

511
00:31:55,208 --> 00:31:56,166
I got bored.

512
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:00,500
What's your plan for the US?

513
00:32:21,833 --> 00:32:22,750
Pretty impressive.

514
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,416
What are your plans here?

515
00:33:08,458 --> 00:33:09,708
"Cigarette King."

516
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:25,500
-Ever thought of investing in a startup?
-No.

517
00:33:32,875 --> 00:33:34,291
Better than selling cigarettes.

518
00:33:36,416 --> 00:33:37,500
I see.

519
00:33:43,875 --> 00:33:46,791
But the one that does succeed,

520
00:33:47,416 --> 00:33:48,250
soars.

521
00:33:48,666 --> 00:33:49,750
And this is that one.

522
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:51,625
I'll explain everything.

523
00:33:54,291 --> 00:33:55,125
I risked bullets.

524
00:33:55,625 --> 00:33:58,041
I had a girl, love and promises.

525
00:33:58,291 --> 00:34:00,083
But he is the true romantic.

526
00:34:00,458 --> 00:34:01,375
The app is down.

527
00:34:01,458 --> 00:34:02,500
We're broke.

528
00:34:02,791 --> 00:34:05,000
But he throws away his US job

529
00:34:05,083 --> 00:34:06,416
all because a cigarette seller
heard his sob-story.

530
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:08,333
He's not a cigarette seller.

531
00:34:08,416 --> 00:34:10,083
His father is the Cigarette King of India.

532
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:12,416
That makes him the Cigarette Prince.

533
00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:16,750
Laugh all you want now.

534
00:34:16,833 --> 00:34:18,708
When he calls, my cigarette will be lit.

535
00:34:18,791 --> 00:34:20,375
Then I will have the last laugh.

536
00:34:39,833 --> 00:34:41,541
It's good you didn't go to the US.

537
00:34:43,083 --> 00:34:44,916
-Looks like I will have to go.
-What?

538
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:47,125
I'm screwed.

539
00:34:47,375 --> 00:34:48,750
Veer hasn't replied.

540
00:34:48,833 --> 00:34:50,000
Who isn't screwed?

541
00:34:50,416 --> 00:34:52,541
That girl was talking the kid
off the ledge,

542
00:34:52,625 --> 00:34:55,125
and I was wondering
how I'll pay her salary.

543
00:35:00,166 --> 00:35:03,666
Remember when we went on strike
for the canteen workers in college?

544
00:35:04,375 --> 00:35:06,458
The Director wanted to suspend you.

545
00:35:07,083 --> 00:35:08,333
And you said,

546
00:35:08,625 --> 00:35:10,791
"'We are doing right,
so we can't be wronged."

547
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:14,333
I said that?

548
00:35:14,875 --> 00:35:15,833
Such a cheesy line?

549
00:35:16,666 --> 00:35:18,500
Yes, you did.

550
00:35:24,625 --> 00:35:25,500
See?

551
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:29,250
This is who you are.

552
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:32,625
Wasn't it your stupid idea
to elope with Richa?

553
00:35:33,791 --> 00:35:36,333
Beyond a point,
there's no point fighting this hard.

554
00:35:40,208 --> 00:35:41,041
You're right.

555
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:43,458
I am stupid.

556
00:35:44,291 --> 00:35:46,166
No, man. At least you try.

557
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:48,666
Otherwise, this guy
would still be moping about Richa.

558
00:35:48,875 --> 00:35:49,708
Like me.

559
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:52,083
I mean...

560
00:35:53,666 --> 00:35:55,666
I spend all day
worrying about Parkinson's,

561
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:57,875
even though Dad is so far away.

562
00:36:14,333 --> 00:36:15,333
You will be fine.

563
00:36:25,875 --> 00:36:26,916
You don't worry.

564
00:36:27,875 --> 00:36:29,666
I'll talk to my boss about a job for you.

565
00:37:05,791 --> 00:37:06,625
It's done!

566
00:37:07,375 --> 00:37:08,208
What?

567
00:37:08,666 --> 00:37:10,250
-Cigarettes, man.
-What?

568
00:37:10,333 --> 00:37:11,916
-The cigarette is lit.
-It is?

569
00:37:12,583 --> 00:37:13,666
Yes!

570
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:18,500
The cigarette is lit!

571
00:37:18,833 --> 00:37:20,291
-Twenty five million?
-Yes.

572
00:37:20,625 --> 00:37:22,708
For a 25% share?

573
00:37:22,958 --> 00:37:25,500
So, our company's valuation
will be hundred million?

574
00:37:25,583 --> 00:37:26,708
One hundred million.

575
00:37:26,791 --> 00:37:28,208
-Our company will be worth 100 million?
-Yes.

576
00:37:28,291 --> 00:37:29,791
-How?
-Why not?

577
00:37:29,875 --> 00:37:31,666
-We're expecting one million customers.
-OK.

578
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:33,375
-An income of Rs.100 per customer.
-Yes?

579
00:37:33,458 --> 00:37:34,416
That's 100 million.

580
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,166
-Excuse me.
-What are you thinking?

581
00:37:36,375 --> 00:37:39,333
But, we only have 10,000 customers.

582
00:37:40,166 --> 00:37:42,666
Right now, yes. Imagine the future.

583
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:44,458
We'll go from 10,000 to a million.

584
00:37:45,041 --> 00:37:47,791
Veer gets 25%. And 25% for each of us.

585
00:37:47,875 --> 00:37:49,666
We'll get our share in five years.

586
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:51,291
-Five years? And until then?
-Yes.

587
00:37:51,375 --> 00:37:53,708
Until then, you'll keep getting
5% every year.

588
00:37:53,791 --> 00:37:55,125
There is a lock-in period of 5 years.

589
00:37:55,375 --> 00:37:56,625
What is a lock-in period?

590
00:37:56,708 --> 00:37:58,500
It's standard for startups.

591
00:37:58,583 --> 00:38:00,375
You cannot sell your share for five years.

592
00:38:00,458 --> 00:38:02,416
Whatever. Where's the booze?

593
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:05,500
-There it is.
-There's one extra, but that's OK.

594
00:38:09,458 --> 00:38:11,125
Wait. Not yet.

595
00:38:11,208 --> 00:38:12,041
Hold on a minute.

596
00:38:12,625 --> 00:38:13,833
Pass me a pen.

597
00:38:15,458 --> 00:38:16,291
Yes?

598
00:38:16,541 --> 00:38:19,875
You are now the Chief Technology Officer
of CarryKaro.

599
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:29,041
You are our Chief Operating Officer.

600
00:38:31,875 --> 00:38:33,000
Let's drink?

601
00:38:58,333 --> 00:38:59,666
After Dad, there's only you.

602
00:40:11,291 --> 00:40:12,166
Yes, Veer.

603
00:40:14,666 --> 00:40:16,416
We'll keep the tech cost in check.

604
00:40:17,541 --> 00:40:18,625
Yeah.

605
00:40:20,083 --> 00:40:20,916
Tomorrow?

606
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:23,333
Here?

607
00:40:27,208 --> 00:40:28,500
No. It won't be a problem.

608
00:40:39,875 --> 00:40:42,500
A journalist from the Harrington Post
is visiting us tomorrow.

609
00:40:42,583 --> 00:40:44,416
-Really?
-Tech cost? What's his problem?

610
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:46,541
-Don't blame me if the system crashes.
-Come on, man.

611
00:40:46,625 --> 00:40:48,375
-Veer's a rockstar.
-Right?

612
00:40:48,458 --> 00:40:50,333
He's no rockstar.
He's just another rich brat.

613
00:40:50,916 --> 00:40:53,458
Show the boss some respect, man.

614
00:40:53,666 --> 00:40:55,166
I know his type.

615
00:40:55,541 --> 00:40:58,500
They buy a car for five million,

616
00:40:58,666 --> 00:41:01,125
then whine about spending 50 bucks
on repairs.

617
00:41:03,125 --> 00:41:04,666
You don't need me here, do you?

618
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:06,583
The new tracking module is going live.

619
00:41:06,666 --> 00:41:08,583
I have to work with the team all night.

620
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,208
-All night?
-Yes.

621
00:41:10,291 --> 00:41:11,916
Are you nuts? They're human beings.

622
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,708
And it will look bad
if the office is empty tomorrow.

623
00:41:13,791 --> 00:41:14,708
It has to be done.

624
00:41:14,791 --> 00:41:16,166
Do it tomorrow.

625
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:18,375
Dad's report comes out tomorrow.

626
00:41:18,708 --> 00:41:20,416
It was hard getting an appointment
with that doctor.

627
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:22,666
-You'll come along, right?
-Of course.

628
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:24,000
Do it day after tomorrow.

629
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:25,458
What do you mean?

630
00:41:25,541 --> 00:41:27,541
This is a process.
It needs proper planning.

631
00:41:27,625 --> 00:41:30,375
You can't stop working
because some guy is visiting.

632
00:41:33,083 --> 00:41:34,916
Kapil, you never stand up to Veer.

633
00:41:35,041 --> 00:41:35,916
That's wrong.

634
00:41:36,041 --> 00:41:37,541
Stop cribbing.

635
00:41:37,625 --> 00:41:39,416
If you don't want to come, don't.

636
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:41,250
-But let the team come.
-OK.

637
00:41:41,333 --> 00:41:44,916
Anyway, Mr. Perfectionist,
do you let anyone else do anything?

638
00:42:28,125 --> 00:42:31,833
Please wear a business suit this evening.

639
00:42:32,125 --> 00:42:33,541
Not even at your wedding.

640
00:42:34,041 --> 00:42:36,375
It's a business meeting.
It's at a fancy place.

641
00:42:36,458 --> 00:42:37,375
We can't look like slobs.

642
00:42:37,791 --> 00:42:40,750
Wow, since he met Veer,
we look like slobs to him.

643
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:21,833
Come on.

644
00:45:24,291 --> 00:45:26,000
Didn't I tell you this cut would suit him?

645
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:28,375
-Looking smart.
-Thank you.

646
00:45:28,458 --> 00:45:31,041
There was a time
when Veer paid me such compliments.

647
00:45:41,250 --> 00:45:42,500
Let's chat later.

648
00:45:45,333 --> 00:45:49,000
When I cared about people,
even the girl from Sitapur ditched me.

649
00:45:50,333 --> 00:45:52,500
When I cared about God,
I found a Spanish chick.

650
00:45:55,083 --> 00:45:57,541
Only God can get an engineer laid.

651
00:45:58,791 --> 00:45:59,666
Is Mr. Yash here?

652
00:46:00,125 --> 00:46:01,250
-What?
-Yash?

653
00:46:04,625 --> 00:46:05,500
Your package.

654
00:46:07,541 --> 00:46:08,416
450 rupees.

655
00:46:09,458 --> 00:46:10,333
Just a moment.

656
00:46:11,083 --> 00:46:13,625
-Aren't the liquor stores shut today?
-Only in Bangalore city.

657
00:46:15,875 --> 00:46:17,083
Show him the app.

658
00:46:17,458 --> 00:46:18,291
-Sorry?
-The app.

659
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:19,333
OK.

660
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:23,583
Hold it there.

661
00:46:29,708 --> 00:46:30,625
Great.

662
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:34,833
It was a simple hack.
Just had to do change one module.

663
00:46:34,916 --> 00:46:37,041
If you would focus on things
other than alcohol,

664
00:46:37,125 --> 00:46:38,166
you could change the world.

665
00:46:38,708 --> 00:46:40,625
All I want is to drink with my friends.

666
00:46:40,708 --> 00:46:41,833
I'm already doing that.

667
00:46:41,916 --> 00:46:43,250
Now all we need is some ice.

668
00:46:43,333 --> 00:46:44,583
-Go.
-Yes, Sangappa?

669
00:46:46,041 --> 00:46:46,875
What?

670
00:46:47,458 --> 00:46:48,291
Where?

671
00:46:48,875 --> 00:46:51,000
We spoke about you just this morning,
and here you are.

672
00:46:53,875 --> 00:46:55,333
You're just like your father.

673
00:46:55,958 --> 00:46:56,958
His father and I are good friends.

674
00:46:57,625 --> 00:46:59,250
But the two of us get along better.

675
00:47:00,625 --> 00:47:03,416
-Dad and I are poles apart.
-Really?

676
00:47:04,041 --> 00:47:05,375
He's spreading cancer...

677
00:47:05,958 --> 00:47:07,333
while I am distributing medicines.

678
00:47:09,166 --> 00:47:10,333
Spoken like a true son.

679
00:47:11,333 --> 00:47:14,541
Splurge all of your dad's money,
and then criticize him too.

680
00:47:20,875 --> 00:47:22,625
Set up this meeting for me.

681
00:47:23,666 --> 00:47:25,375
And I'll do another thing sons do.

682
00:47:26,750 --> 00:47:28,125
I'll outshine him.

683
00:47:35,291 --> 00:47:36,125
Yeah, what's up?

684
00:47:36,333 --> 00:47:37,875
When do you get back from Chennai?

685
00:47:38,250 --> 00:47:39,250
We have a problem.

686
00:47:39,333 --> 00:47:40,916
There are floods in Belgavi district.

687
00:47:41,125 --> 00:47:43,416
We're getting more orders
than the app can handle.

688
00:47:47,791 --> 00:47:49,583
This is exactly why we built the app.

689
00:47:49,666 --> 00:47:51,250
We will deliver when no one else can.

690
00:47:51,375 --> 00:47:52,541
But how can we?

691
00:47:52,625 --> 00:47:56,708
The situation is so bad,
even our own employees are refusing to go.

692
00:47:58,583 --> 00:48:00,000
I'll do the deliveries.

693
00:48:01,250 --> 00:48:02,583
Bless you, Mother Teresa.

694
00:48:15,041 --> 00:48:16,458
Kapil, you're joking, right?

695
00:48:20,833 --> 00:48:22,000
They will invest at least 600 million.

696
00:48:22,083 --> 00:48:23,291
Imagine what that will do
to our evaluation.

697
00:48:23,375 --> 00:48:25,500
-But we already have money.
-Exactly.

698
00:48:25,916 --> 00:48:27,333
Kapil, there's a flood.

699
00:48:27,583 --> 00:48:28,541
People are dying.

700
00:48:29,625 --> 00:48:31,500
These VCs are very hard to meet, Kapil.

701
00:48:33,916 --> 00:48:34,750
Just hold on.

702
00:48:35,291 --> 00:48:36,125
Hello.

703
00:48:41,041 --> 00:48:42,708
This meeting was hard to set up.

704
00:48:45,541 --> 00:48:46,833
Kapil, don't be absurd.

705
00:48:47,166 --> 00:48:48,416
You promised to deliver.

706
00:48:48,791 --> 00:48:50,458
We're busy running the backend.

707
00:48:50,541 --> 00:48:52,416
Is Veer an investor or a pimp?

708
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:55,000
Why is he pimping us out?

709
00:48:56,875 --> 00:49:00,000
Veer, this is the worst flood
in five years.

710
00:49:00,083 --> 00:49:03,291
-We have so many orders--
-I have no problem with the deliveries.

711
00:49:03,375 --> 00:49:05,375
I have a problem
with you making the deliveries.

712
00:49:18,083 --> 00:49:19,416
Do what you think is right.

713
00:49:34,375 --> 00:49:35,625
Do what you think is right.

714
00:51:14,291 --> 00:51:15,666
But we are trying to...

715
00:51:17,750 --> 00:51:19,333
Did you watch the interview, sir?

716
00:51:19,416 --> 00:51:20,250
Look...

717
00:51:21,291 --> 00:51:25,708
Currently, we are the only company
delivering medicines to the flooded areas.

718
00:51:26,166 --> 00:51:29,125
This must be very good for business.

719
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:32,541
This isn't the time to think
about profits, it's about people.

720
00:51:32,916 --> 00:51:35,791
Villages are flooded,
diseases are spreading.

721
00:51:35,875 --> 00:51:36,791
That should be the focus.

722
00:51:36,875 --> 00:51:38,041
When did the logo change?

723
00:51:38,416 --> 00:51:41,833
Our team has been making deliveries

724
00:51:41,916 --> 00:51:43,083
in the flood-hit areas.

725
00:51:43,208 --> 00:51:44,208
We're trying...

726
00:51:55,625 --> 00:51:57,166
Done with the press conference?

727
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:00,208
Dude, at least keep us informed.

728
00:52:05,041 --> 00:52:07,291
We don't even have time to take a piss.

729
00:52:15,875 --> 00:52:18,291
There's something called integrity.

730
00:52:20,666 --> 00:52:22,625
Don't make a mountain out of a molehill.

731
00:52:22,916 --> 00:52:24,458
We deliver to 104 villages.

732
00:52:24,541 --> 00:52:27,708
But we only show 90 to the investors. Why?

733
00:52:27,791 --> 00:52:29,333
Because we make big losses
in those 14 villages.

734
00:52:29,416 --> 00:52:32,458
The lower the losses,
the more your investor invests.

735
00:52:32,875 --> 00:52:35,458
-Is this a trivial thing?
-It is trivial.

736
00:52:35,541 --> 00:52:38,166
Our work, deliveries,
and users are all genuine.

737
00:52:38,708 --> 00:52:40,291
These losses are temporary.

738
00:52:41,708 --> 00:52:43,458
We're doing something good here.

739
00:52:44,083 --> 00:52:45,416
We set out to do good.

740
00:52:49,458 --> 00:52:50,291
Come on, man.

741
00:52:50,708 --> 00:52:53,500
We don't want to pull a con.
Why don't you get that?

742
00:52:53,833 --> 00:52:54,833
-A con?
-Yes.

743
00:52:56,416 --> 00:52:57,916
Why are you so desperate?

744
00:52:58,041 --> 00:53:00,708
-Veer will give us the money.
-Veer doesn't give. He takes.

745
00:53:10,083 --> 00:53:10,916
What's wrong?

746
00:53:12,666 --> 00:53:15,000
We're worried about the losses
in the 14 villages.

747
00:53:20,625 --> 00:53:22,583
And, the tech cost is too high.

748
00:53:28,291 --> 00:53:29,875
Tech cost? Again?

749
00:53:30,166 --> 00:53:31,541
Has he ever done any coding?

750
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:33,041
Why does he go on about tech cost?

751
00:53:33,125 --> 00:53:35,125
Exactly. You're always lecturing us.

752
00:53:35,208 --> 00:53:36,541
why don't you ever say anything to him?

753
00:53:36,625 --> 00:53:38,916
At least tell him
when you're in the toilet together.

754
00:53:39,458 --> 00:53:41,208
I'm sure they go together?

755
00:53:41,291 --> 00:53:43,375
-Who else will wash Veer's ass?
-No.

756
00:53:43,458 --> 00:53:45,291
Rich dudes don't wash, they wipe.

757
00:53:48,791 --> 00:53:50,708
Please, don't do this.

758
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:52,916
Let me do my job, guys.

759
00:53:53,041 --> 00:53:56,666
Are the villagers your customers,
or these investors?

760
00:53:56,750 --> 00:54:00,041
We can't ignore
the investor either, right?

761
00:54:00,250 --> 00:54:01,708
Without them, there is no us.

762
00:54:04,416 --> 00:54:07,166
-In the beginning-
-The beginning was so different.

763
00:54:07,625 --> 00:54:09,041
We had set a condition, right?

764
00:54:13,958 --> 00:54:15,541
-"Do something good."
-That's what I am doing.

765
00:54:15,791 --> 00:54:17,208
Remember, we were shut down.

766
00:54:17,291 --> 00:54:20,291
If it wasn't for Veer, I'd be eating
frozen Indian food in the US.

767
00:54:25,458 --> 00:54:26,541
Guys, what is happening?

768
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:28,666
I won't allow this as long as I'm here.

769
00:54:29,166 --> 00:54:30,625
And what do you mean by that?

770
00:54:30,708 --> 00:54:31,750
Kapil, let it be.

771
00:54:35,083 --> 00:54:36,166
Think again, Kapil.

772
00:54:36,458 --> 00:54:38,833
I already did. We'll see what happens.

773
00:54:39,666 --> 00:54:40,541
Fine.

774
00:54:40,833 --> 00:54:42,500
If you con them, I'll resign.

775
00:54:43,541 --> 00:54:44,500
What is he saying?

776
00:54:44,833 --> 00:54:47,458
I said, if you con them, I'll resign.

777
00:54:47,708 --> 00:54:49,291
Have you been drinking?
You bloody drunkard?

778
00:54:49,375 --> 00:54:50,750
What the hell are you saying?

779
00:54:50,875 --> 00:54:52,416
-What did I say?
-Stop calling me a drunkard.

780
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:53,750
Or what--

781
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:27,833
"This is not the time to think
about business, but the people."

782
00:55:29,833 --> 00:55:33,458
That was all Yash and Vinay. I was just...

783
00:55:37,166 --> 00:55:38,416
You're doing both.

784
00:55:39,333 --> 00:55:40,625
Service too. Profit too.

785
00:55:41,875 --> 00:55:42,833
What's up? All okay?

786
00:55:49,083 --> 00:55:51,791
I'm sorry.
I hope I didn't spoil your occasion.

787
00:55:51,875 --> 00:55:53,333
There is no occasion.

788
00:55:55,208 --> 00:55:58,166
You know how you'd said
everyone's screwed.

789
00:55:59,833 --> 00:56:01,666
Sometimes it's seen. Sometimes it's not.

790
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:04,541
I'm the one who needs counseling now.

791
00:56:05,083 --> 00:56:06,250
And that too, from you.

792
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:08,500
What's the point?

793
00:56:09,416 --> 00:56:11,708
You'll just hear your own words recycled.

794
00:56:13,791 --> 00:56:14,625
"Keep at it."

795
00:56:22,041 --> 00:56:23,416
I'll hang up.

796
00:56:28,583 --> 00:56:30,750
So, it's like a pipeline.

797
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:35,750
And only for these medicines.

798
00:56:36,041 --> 00:56:37,250
Delivering to these NGOs.

799
00:56:39,708 --> 00:56:40,541
Well...

800
00:56:42,416 --> 00:56:43,541
Let's stop here for now.

801
00:56:48,541 --> 00:56:52,666
If Veer finds out we've been running
a two-way highway, he'll be stunned.

802
00:57:25,875 --> 00:57:28,666
So, how many villages
have you delivered to till now?

803
00:57:57,541 --> 00:57:58,916
What's up, Your Highness?

804
00:57:59,166 --> 00:58:00,750
Where the hell are you two?

805
00:58:01,458 --> 00:58:02,666
Is Yash around?

806
00:58:03,250 --> 00:58:04,083
Hang on.

807
00:58:09,291 --> 00:58:10,708
There you go. Yash is here too.

808
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:13,666
You guys did it.
You two really cracked it.

809
00:58:13,750 --> 00:58:15,833
That liquor idea was a masterstroke.

810
00:58:16,416 --> 00:58:18,416
The investors were bowled over.

811
00:58:19,083 --> 00:58:20,875
I just signed the term sheet, guys.

812
00:58:21,291 --> 00:58:22,333
Just got lucky, man.

813
00:58:22,791 --> 00:58:23,625
Anyway...

814
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:31,375
Right?

815
00:58:36,833 --> 00:58:38,375
I heard. Congratulations.

816
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:45,000
Listen, let's take a vacation.

817
00:58:45,208 --> 00:58:47,166
It's been such a stressful week.

818
00:58:47,291 --> 00:58:49,833
A strategy offsite.
Bangkok, Mauritius, you name it.

819
00:58:51,916 --> 00:58:52,750
What say?

820
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,291
Don't do this, guys.

821
00:59:03,250 --> 00:59:04,083
Look...

822
00:59:09,166 --> 00:59:10,291
We have resigned.

823
00:59:15,375 --> 00:59:16,458
I should resign too.

824
00:59:16,541 --> 00:59:19,875
Haven't slept in days.
This is no way to live.

825
00:59:24,416 --> 00:59:25,250
Hey...

826
00:59:26,916 --> 00:59:29,916
What do you mean?
What do you mean you resigned?

827
00:59:33,291 --> 00:59:34,125
We got bored.

828
00:59:35,333 --> 00:59:36,750
We are better off as friends.

829
00:59:37,208 --> 00:59:38,416
-Right, Yash?
-Yeah.

830
00:59:38,750 --> 00:59:41,250
Hold on, guys. How can you? I mean...

831
00:59:41,750 --> 00:59:44,416
How can you take such a big decision
without talking to me?

832
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:45,416
I had warned you.

833
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:47,708
If you fudge numbers, I'll...

834
00:59:47,791 --> 00:59:50,500
Don't start that again.
Yash, wait a second.

835
00:59:53,125 --> 00:59:55,000
Let's meet and talk.

836
00:59:55,083 --> 00:59:56,083
I'll explain everything.

837
00:59:56,166 --> 00:59:58,250
Why don't you explain it to Veer instead?

838
01:00:10,375 --> 01:00:13,416
Look, Kapil. It's obvious
we can't work together.

839
01:00:14,041 --> 01:00:14,875
Why?

840
01:00:16,208 --> 01:00:17,541
Why can't we work together?

841
01:00:19,208 --> 01:00:21,041
Don't make it sound worse than it is.

842
01:00:21,125 --> 01:00:22,750
We are not.

843
01:00:22,833 --> 01:00:25,125
It's different now.
The vibe, it's totally changed.

844
01:00:25,416 --> 01:00:26,500
What has changed?

845
01:00:26,583 --> 01:00:28,750
We had a stressful week,
and it's over now.

846
01:00:28,833 --> 01:00:29,791
End of story.

847
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,208
Whom am I doing this for?

848
01:00:32,291 --> 01:00:33,125
For us.

849
01:00:33,416 --> 01:00:36,791
It's better if each of us
do our own thing, right?

850
01:00:37,041 --> 01:00:38,166
The way it was before.

851
01:00:41,541 --> 01:00:45,083
The point was to work together.
How can I do this alone?

852
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:48,333
-What?
-Alone.

853
01:00:49,208 --> 01:00:50,041
Forgot Mr. Veer?

854
01:00:50,125 --> 01:00:52,541
-What's Veer got to do with this?
-I should be asking you that.

855
01:00:52,625 --> 01:00:55,833
-What the hell is he saying?
-Stop fighting, guys.

856
01:00:55,916 --> 01:00:57,041
What the hell is he saying?

857
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,708
Kapil, look.

858
01:01:02,333 --> 01:01:04,500
A good investor for you.
A good job for you.

859
01:01:05,208 --> 01:01:06,583
And a long vacation for me.

860
01:01:06,916 --> 01:01:10,041
We've all got what we wanted.
So, just be happy for each other.

861
01:01:10,250 --> 01:01:11,208
Stop fighting.

862
01:01:12,458 --> 01:01:13,916
How can I be happy?

863
01:01:17,708 --> 01:01:19,250
My drama queen.

864
01:01:52,125 --> 01:01:52,958
Yeah.

865
01:01:53,791 --> 01:01:54,625
Great.

866
01:03:33,125 --> 01:03:35,125
Is Yash around? I didn't see him.

867
01:03:35,833 --> 01:03:39,208
He might be your CTO now,
but he's always been my friend.

868
01:03:40,625 --> 01:03:42,583
Your friend?

869
01:03:43,666 --> 01:03:45,333
Yash doesn't work with me anymore.

870
01:03:45,666 --> 01:03:47,875
-What?
-He quit six months ago.

871
01:03:48,833 --> 01:03:50,333
Didn't your friend tell you that?

872
01:04:09,375 --> 01:04:12,291
So, you just wave your phone
over any body part,

873
01:04:12,875 --> 01:04:16,166
and get a full report on your hair.

874
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:23,166
But no one's ever built an app
focusing on hair.

875
01:04:33,041 --> 01:04:33,875
Where's Yash?

876
01:04:34,208 --> 01:04:36,166
Hurry up, Yash. What's happening?

877
01:04:55,375 --> 01:04:58,500
Jaya, don't you think
your idea is too focused?

878
01:05:01,208 --> 01:05:02,791
There's no scope to go wider.

879
01:05:03,083 --> 01:05:04,750
Your technology is good, I agree.

880
01:05:05,208 --> 01:05:08,125
-But can we apply it to a different field?
-Different field?

881
01:05:08,750 --> 01:05:11,500
Mental health alone is a huge issue, sir.

882
01:05:12,875 --> 01:05:16,416
Even in mental health, there's scope
for forward and backward integration.

883
01:05:18,333 --> 01:05:20,458
Actually, I don't want
any conflict of interest.

884
01:05:20,541 --> 01:05:22,791
Sure. It will stay what it is.

885
01:05:35,625 --> 01:05:37,083
Why does she even come?

886
01:05:37,166 --> 01:05:38,750
There's nothing we can do for her.

887
01:05:49,208 --> 01:05:50,625
He knows what happened.

888
01:05:52,125 --> 01:05:55,333
Just tell me, if you can't handle
a simple presentation,

889
01:05:55,416 --> 01:05:56,666
what kind of CTO are you?

890
01:05:59,208 --> 01:06:00,208
He ruined everything.

891
01:06:00,291 --> 01:06:01,333
You should have checked it last night.

892
01:06:01,416 --> 01:06:04,291
Does it even matter to you
who is up on stage, we are juniors.

893
01:06:04,375 --> 01:06:05,541
Nothing matters to him.

894
01:06:05,625 --> 01:06:07,500
What's the point of talking to him?

895
01:06:08,666 --> 01:06:11,500
We told you to check everything.

896
01:06:26,416 --> 01:06:29,916
Doesn't matter which way you comb
your hair, you will never impress a girl.

897
01:06:33,375 --> 01:06:34,791
Come here, man.

898
01:06:36,166 --> 01:06:37,000
How are you?

899
01:06:40,458 --> 01:06:41,291
How are you?

900
01:06:46,166 --> 01:06:48,291
It's been so long.

901
01:06:48,500 --> 01:06:50,875
I have a meeting now.
But let's meet after that.

902
01:06:56,541 --> 01:06:58,083
What's up?

903
01:07:02,541 --> 01:07:04,041
Your meeting was quick.

904
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:11,250
One billion is more than enough now.

905
01:07:11,333 --> 01:07:13,708
We should've accepted
their offer of Rs. 1.5 billion.

906
01:07:15,833 --> 01:07:17,708
Our valuation needs to be higher, Kapil.

907
01:07:19,583 --> 01:07:21,916
-What did you do, man?
-What happened?

908
01:07:22,500 --> 01:07:23,833
We lost 1.5 billion rupees.

909
01:07:24,166 --> 01:07:26,375
Didn't you just raise funds recently?

910
01:07:28,875 --> 01:07:31,000
But seriously, man, what did you do?

911
01:07:31,625 --> 01:07:34,041
You think I'll ever do anything
without a plan?

912
01:07:37,375 --> 01:07:38,875
We have an offer for six billion.

913
01:07:40,333 --> 01:07:41,875
-Nonsense.
-From SoftSent.

914
01:07:42,666 --> 01:07:44,500
The world's biggest venture capitalist.

915
01:07:54,875 --> 01:07:56,875
You are a pro!

916
01:07:57,791 --> 01:07:59,333
OK, calm down.

917
01:08:09,208 --> 01:08:10,333
That's not right.

918
01:08:10,666 --> 01:08:12,041
This is not fair.

919
01:08:18,916 --> 01:08:21,291
You two shouldn't have
left me alone like this.

920
01:08:26,250 --> 01:08:28,125
Did you know Yash left Bansal's company?

921
01:08:28,666 --> 01:08:29,500
Yes.

922
01:08:30,500 --> 01:08:32,125
And two more companies after that.

923
01:08:32,625 --> 01:08:33,625
Two more?

924
01:08:40,375 --> 01:08:41,916
His door is open.

925
01:08:42,041 --> 01:08:42,875
Open?

926
01:08:47,333 --> 01:08:48,750
-Yash!
-Wake him up.

927
01:08:52,333 --> 01:08:54,833
-Get up!
-Help him up.

928
01:08:55,750 --> 01:08:56,750
Sit straight.

929
01:09:04,708 --> 01:09:07,625
My app was perfect.

930
01:09:08,791 --> 01:09:10,375
The problem was with his phone.

931
01:09:10,791 --> 01:09:12,208
And yet they blamed me.

932
01:09:15,625 --> 01:09:16,500
Tea.

933
01:09:17,458 --> 01:09:19,791
Half the companies out there
are donkey stables.

934
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,541
Filled with asses and manure.

935
01:09:22,333 --> 01:09:25,708
And the CEO is the biggest ass of all.

936
01:09:27,583 --> 01:09:31,416
Listening, kissing someone's ass
and braying.

937
01:09:32,125 --> 01:09:34,166
The one who does all three is the CEO.

938
01:09:35,250 --> 01:09:36,458
You're right.

939
01:09:37,666 --> 01:09:39,041
Take yourself for instance.

940
01:09:40,875 --> 01:09:42,875
But there's nothing you can do about it.

941
01:09:43,375 --> 01:09:46,208
You have to play by their rules.

942
01:09:51,625 --> 01:09:53,083
You have so much potential.

943
01:09:54,666 --> 01:09:56,625
-I'm drinking tea, man.
-"Drinking tea"?

944
01:09:57,833 --> 01:09:59,166
Learn some self-control.

945
01:09:59,750 --> 01:10:00,583
Come back.

946
01:10:11,750 --> 01:10:13,666
Isn't Pawan Soni your CTO?

947
01:10:14,500 --> 01:10:16,291
Yeah, not as the CTO, but...

948
01:10:17,958 --> 01:10:19,583
Try to understand, I meant...

949
01:10:22,083 --> 01:10:22,916
Look...

950
01:10:31,291 --> 01:10:32,208
Forget it.

951
01:10:33,416 --> 01:10:35,166
You know, CarryKaro was boring.

952
01:10:37,250 --> 01:10:39,416
I need a real challenge.

953
01:10:39,500 --> 01:10:40,750
Challenge? Look at your condition.

954
01:10:40,833 --> 01:10:42,291
-What's wrong with my condition?
-"What's wrong"?

955
01:10:42,375 --> 01:10:43,666
Yash, what's happened to you?

956
01:10:44,333 --> 01:10:45,166
What?

957
01:10:45,375 --> 01:10:46,541
What's your mood?

958
01:10:53,208 --> 01:10:55,000
-Hello.
-Hello.

959
01:13:24,333 --> 01:13:27,125
Look at your valuation,
and look at your capacity.

960
01:13:32,166 --> 01:13:34,000
Stop looking at Veer for everything.

961
01:13:34,750 --> 01:13:35,750
Bottoms up.

962
01:13:44,625 --> 01:13:48,541
We're into electronics, food, consumer
goods. We're thinking of apparel.

963
01:13:50,208 --> 01:13:52,083
As soon as SoftSent funds come in,

964
01:13:52,166 --> 01:13:54,541
there are a lot of avenues
of growth that we can look into.

965
01:14:05,250 --> 01:14:06,500
How does it feel?

966
01:14:08,833 --> 01:14:10,208
Where's the time to feel?

967
01:14:19,583 --> 01:14:22,208
-I couldn't even recognize you.
-Don't laugh.

968
01:14:22,708 --> 01:14:24,416
This is what it has come to now.

969
01:14:25,125 --> 01:14:27,041
Even when I went completely decked up,

970
01:14:27,458 --> 01:14:29,500
the investors said, "get out!"

971
01:14:30,666 --> 01:14:33,416
-I would've invested money in your idea.
-Oh, really?

972
01:14:33,708 --> 01:14:35,500
I saw what you did for me as a judge.

973
01:14:42,208 --> 01:14:43,041
Yeah...

974
01:14:43,833 --> 01:14:44,875
You know...

975
01:14:45,125 --> 01:14:47,000
-Oh, man.
-Stop it.

976
01:14:47,083 --> 01:14:49,500
-What are you doing?
-Accepting your apology.

977
01:14:49,625 --> 01:14:50,833
And in return, you have to teach me.

978
01:14:50,916 --> 01:14:52,666
I'm tired of begging for money.

979
01:14:56,125 --> 01:14:57,458
What does the investor want?

980
01:15:00,291 --> 01:15:03,625
He can get that from a confectionery shop.
So why startups?

981
01:15:04,208 --> 01:15:06,583
Because startups are a high-risk,
high-gain game.

982
01:15:07,125 --> 01:15:08,166
Most startups fail,

983
01:15:08,250 --> 01:15:11,125
but the one that succeeds,
just soars, like a rocket.

984
01:15:11,708 --> 01:15:14,041
-So?
-So, sell them rocket-like growth.

985
01:15:14,416 --> 01:15:15,250
Oh, God!

986
01:15:19,041 --> 01:15:19,875
So...

987
01:15:20,083 --> 01:15:22,333
But we can't have rocket-like growth
in every field, Kapil.

988
01:15:22,625 --> 01:15:24,666
You have to make it happen.

989
01:15:25,500 --> 01:15:28,541
Why do cab companies share promo codes?

990
01:15:29,083 --> 01:15:32,291
Why do online shopping companies
host Billion Dollar sales?

991
01:15:32,500 --> 01:15:34,875
-We still make losses in deliveries.
-Still?

992
01:15:35,333 --> 01:15:37,458
Yes, but try to understand. It's simple.

993
01:15:37,541 --> 01:15:39,750
Sell some stake to the investor.
Take their money.

994
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:41,583
Use that money to attract customers.

995
01:15:41,833 --> 01:15:43,875
This may mean losses,
but it gets you growth.

996
01:15:44,333 --> 01:15:46,041
As you grow, your valuation rises.

997
01:15:46,291 --> 01:15:48,625
With this new valuation,
find new investors.

998
01:15:49,041 --> 01:15:50,666
Sell them more expensive stakes.

999
01:15:51,041 --> 01:15:53,041
Your previous investors will make profits.

1000
01:15:53,125 --> 01:15:54,083
They'll be happy.

1001
01:15:54,500 --> 01:15:56,208
You have more to invest in your firm.

1002
01:15:56,291 --> 01:15:57,291
So, you'll be happy.

1003
01:15:58,458 --> 01:16:01,166
Investors give money, money
attracts customers, customers fuel growth,

1004
01:16:01,250 --> 01:16:03,500
growth gets a higher valuation,
higher valuation gets new investors.

1005
01:16:07,333 --> 01:16:08,166
Oh, God.

1006
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:11,375
Yeah, Veer?

1007
01:16:14,208 --> 01:16:15,916
Fine, I'll get it done and send it.

1008
01:16:16,625 --> 01:16:18,791
Fine, I'll send that by evening.

1009
01:16:19,041 --> 01:16:20,750
Why are you micro-managing so much?

1010
01:16:22,041 --> 01:16:25,541
I mean, our other investors
don't interfere in day-to-day operations.

1011
01:16:28,625 --> 01:16:29,500
I'll get it done.

1012
01:16:29,916 --> 01:16:32,125
So I drop everything
to play this valuation game?

1013
01:16:32,666 --> 01:16:33,500
No.

1014
01:16:34,291 --> 01:16:35,375
That's not the point.

1015
01:16:36,375 --> 01:16:39,666
Your vision should be this: if anyone,
anywhere, from America to Afghanistan,

1016
01:16:39,750 --> 01:16:42,291
thinks about committing suicide,
they should think of your app.

1017
01:16:46,250 --> 01:16:47,458
But isn't this absurd?

1018
01:16:48,416 --> 01:16:50,333
Absurd maybe, but this is what sells.

1019
01:16:51,083 --> 01:16:53,416
If you don't sell growth,
you won't get investors.

1020
01:16:53,708 --> 01:16:55,125
And you'll have to shut down.

1021
01:17:00,166 --> 01:17:02,541
Believe me, Kapil, this is just a bubble.

1022
01:17:03,833 --> 01:17:05,208
And it will burst one day.

1023
01:17:10,083 --> 01:17:12,000
Did you come to learn, or to teach me?

1024
01:17:12,791 --> 01:17:13,791
It's not just Kapil,

1025
01:17:14,500 --> 01:17:17,500
even those HairHealth kids got funded.

1026
01:17:18,375 --> 01:17:19,208
Imagine.

1027
01:17:25,875 --> 01:17:26,708
Yeah.

1028
01:17:28,041 --> 01:17:29,000
Forget that.

1029
01:17:30,458 --> 01:17:31,291
Yeah.

1030
01:17:31,791 --> 01:17:33,666
When are you getting me an interview?

1031
01:17:35,500 --> 01:17:37,666
How can you say that?
In such a junior position?

1032
01:17:40,166 --> 01:17:41,333
No, I understand.

1033
01:17:42,666 --> 01:17:44,291
Let me know if you
have anything else for me.

1034
01:17:46,375 --> 01:17:47,208
Alright.

1035
01:17:55,125 --> 01:17:57,166
Yeah, Dad. I'm at work. Can't talk.

1036
01:18:00,375 --> 01:18:02,041
They are calling me for a meeting.

1037
01:18:04,333 --> 01:18:05,166
How are you?

1038
01:18:10,916 --> 01:18:12,291
I am doing great too.

1039
01:18:14,416 --> 01:18:15,250
Listen...

1040
01:18:17,500 --> 01:18:18,916
Is my hand shaking?

1041
01:18:34,125 --> 01:18:36,333
Vinay, there's something I need to do.

1042
01:18:52,041 --> 01:18:54,000
How are you, sir?

1043
01:18:55,500 --> 01:18:57,166
-How are you?
-Great, sir.

1044
01:18:58,250 --> 01:19:00,125
How many are you in the NGO division?

1045
01:19:00,500 --> 01:19:02,541
Around 25.

1046
01:19:03,041 --> 01:19:03,875
Is that all?

1047
01:19:07,041 --> 01:19:08,208
Do you meet Kapil often?

1048
01:19:08,833 --> 01:19:11,500
We see him go by every day.

1049
01:19:11,875 --> 01:19:12,708
He's a good man.

1050
01:19:13,375 --> 01:19:14,916
Aren't you burning too much cash?

1051
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,916
Come on, man, cut me some slack.

1052
01:19:17,416 --> 01:19:19,333
Mommy in Hong Kong will pay the bills.

1053
01:19:19,666 --> 01:19:21,750
We met SoftSent four months ago, Kapil.

1054
01:19:22,458 --> 01:19:23,833
When will their funds come in?

1055
01:19:24,250 --> 01:19:25,375
Pressurize them.

1056
01:19:26,333 --> 01:19:27,625
Calm down, Veer.

1057
01:19:28,250 --> 01:19:31,125
You seem to be getting soft on SoftSent.

1058
01:19:32,541 --> 01:19:34,000
Nothing fishy going on, I hope.

1059
01:19:35,125 --> 01:19:36,041
Come on.

1060
01:19:36,125 --> 01:19:37,541
I am an investor too.

1061
01:19:37,625 --> 01:19:39,083
I have put in my money too.

1062
01:19:39,708 --> 01:19:41,625
But I never delayed transferring funds.

1063
01:19:42,041 --> 01:19:43,666
But it's your dad's money, right?

1064
01:19:50,083 --> 01:19:51,083
The money will come.

1065
01:19:54,791 --> 01:19:55,625
So, it's true.

1066
01:19:57,416 --> 01:20:00,083
As soon as one gets a godfather,
one does get spoilt.

1067
01:20:13,583 --> 01:20:14,625
-Kapil.
-Yeah.

1068
01:20:18,541 --> 01:20:19,500
How are you doing?

1069
01:20:21,416 --> 01:20:23,125
How are you?

1070
01:20:24,625 --> 01:20:25,500
All good?

1071
01:20:32,250 --> 01:20:33,083
Awesome.

1072
01:20:33,916 --> 01:20:36,375
-Tea or coffee?
-No, thank you.

1073
01:20:39,791 --> 01:20:40,666
Great.

1074
01:20:43,333 --> 01:20:45,458
So, what's up?

1075
01:20:47,583 --> 01:20:49,916
He wants to start his own business.

1076
01:20:53,541 --> 01:20:55,458
Is it... a liquor store?

1077
01:20:57,500 --> 01:21:01,083
No, I was supposed
to join a company, as CTO.

1078
01:21:02,500 --> 01:21:05,208
They had a great idea,
but their funding stopped.

1079
01:21:05,291 --> 01:21:09,166
-OK.
-So, I thought I could invest some money.

1080
01:21:09,250 --> 01:21:10,291
But...

1081
01:21:10,708 --> 01:21:12,625
Do you have the money?

1082
01:21:13,250 --> 01:21:14,541
I have my CarryKaro shares.

1083
01:21:15,041 --> 01:21:16,625
You want to sell your stake
in the company?

1084
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:18,083
Exactly. Don't sell.

1085
01:21:18,458 --> 01:21:20,833
-Put it aside as a retirement fund.
-But...

1086
01:21:20,916 --> 01:21:21,875
Wait a minute.

1087
01:21:22,166 --> 01:21:24,625
You can't sell your stake
for another three years.

1088
01:21:25,083 --> 01:21:25,916
Why?

1089
01:21:26,125 --> 01:21:26,958
Why else?

1090
01:21:30,458 --> 01:21:31,875
It was in the agreement we signed.

1091
01:21:33,791 --> 01:21:34,625
Oh man!

1092
01:21:35,500 --> 01:21:37,375
Why did you agree to such a condition?

1093
01:21:37,458 --> 01:21:40,291
A five-year lock-in is standard
in startups.

1094
01:21:40,375 --> 01:21:42,416
-Remember I explained it.
-Fine. Whatever.

1095
01:21:42,500 --> 01:21:45,375
-But why did you agree to this?
-What is he blabbering?

1096
01:21:49,333 --> 01:21:51,041
-Then you lend it to me.
-What?

1097
01:21:51,708 --> 01:21:52,708
As a personal loan.

1098
01:21:58,250 --> 01:21:59,208
How much?

1099
01:22:00,458 --> 01:22:02,250
-Hundred million.
-Hundred million?

1100
01:22:03,833 --> 01:22:04,708
Come on.

1101
01:22:06,375 --> 01:22:08,666
Are you opening a really big liquor store?

1102
01:22:09,750 --> 01:22:11,708
Good plan.

1103
01:22:11,833 --> 01:22:14,625
He can drink the leftover booze
every night.

1104
01:22:15,500 --> 01:22:17,541
You know it's not easy to run a startup.

1105
01:22:17,625 --> 01:22:20,208
Do you have the money?
Will you lend it to me?

1106
01:22:20,541 --> 01:22:21,750
I don't have 100 million.

1107
01:22:21,833 --> 01:22:23,250
They call you 'the billion-dollar virgin.'

1108
01:22:25,166 --> 01:22:27,416
Like you can't sell your stake,
I can't either.

1109
01:22:27,500 --> 01:22:29,500
-I am a salaried employee.
-And what about all this?

1110
01:22:29,583 --> 01:22:30,416
This?

1111
01:22:30,500 --> 01:22:33,041
The company is growing, and I am the CEO.

1112
01:22:33,291 --> 01:22:34,708
So, the company gives me perks.

1113
01:22:41,208 --> 01:22:42,041
Sit down.

1114
01:22:48,750 --> 01:22:49,916
Forget all these ideas.

1115
01:22:50,541 --> 01:22:51,416
And come back.

1116
01:22:52,750 --> 01:22:54,083
Listen to me.

1117
01:22:55,500 --> 01:22:57,083
You have a problem with Veer, don't you?

1118
01:22:57,833 --> 01:22:59,083
Let me tell you a secret.

1119
01:22:59,458 --> 01:23:00,958
I had a discussion with SoftSent.

1120
01:23:01,375 --> 01:23:03,041
They want some changes.

1121
01:23:04,458 --> 01:23:06,583
And Veer may just be on the way out.

1122
01:23:08,458 --> 01:23:10,916
-But Veer's the--
-These things happen in business.

1123
01:23:15,458 --> 01:23:16,291
So?

1124
01:23:18,083 --> 01:23:19,333
Will you make me your CTO?

1125
01:23:19,708 --> 01:23:21,875
You become the CEO, for god's sake.

1126
01:23:21,958 --> 01:23:24,041
Take my seat, I will resign.

1127
01:23:24,125 --> 01:23:26,291
Just come back.
We'll fix everything else later.

1128
01:23:26,791 --> 01:23:27,666
Forget it!

1129
01:23:28,041 --> 01:23:29,041
Trust you?

1130
01:23:29,125 --> 01:23:31,083
You didn't even explain
the agreement properly.

1131
01:23:31,166 --> 01:23:32,250
You lie to your investors.

1132
01:23:33,791 --> 01:23:34,625
Are you drunk?

1133
01:23:34,958 --> 01:23:36,416
I am in my senses. You are not.

1134
01:23:36,500 --> 01:23:37,541
You are high on this.

1135
01:23:37,625 --> 01:23:39,541
You used to take medicines
to the villages yourself.

1136
01:23:39,625 --> 01:23:41,375
Now you don't even meet the NGO division.

1137
01:23:41,458 --> 01:23:43,458
Don't teach me my job.
Look at the state you are in.

1138
01:23:43,541 --> 01:23:45,250
All your crap about Parkinson's,
it's just the booze talking.

1139
01:23:49,125 --> 01:23:50,583
-Vinay, take him away.
-I don't need rehab.

1140
01:24:13,666 --> 01:24:15,916
Because of the government's
new tax policy,

1141
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,625
investors are turning away
from India's startup market.

1142
01:24:32,250 --> 01:24:35,666
These high valuations were based on hope
that growth would be like China.

1143
01:24:38,500 --> 01:24:40,833
No matter how much you scream "Growth!",

1144
01:24:41,625 --> 01:24:43,750
growth is finite.

1145
01:24:43,833 --> 01:24:46,041
Last week it was FlipShip
and now it's CarryKaro.com

1146
01:24:51,750 --> 01:24:55,083
YRKPF believes that your company valuation
should be 30 billion rupees,

1147
01:24:55,166 --> 01:24:56,375
and not 60 billion.

1148
01:24:58,833 --> 01:25:00,625
You did the due diligence yourself.

1149
01:25:00,916 --> 01:25:02,250
Ms. Cheung agreed, right?

1150
01:25:03,916 --> 01:25:05,833
Now suddenly you want a 50% discount?

1151
01:25:05,916 --> 01:25:08,458
Three billion instead of six billion
for the same stake.

1152
01:25:08,875 --> 01:25:10,708
What will I tell my other investors?

1153
01:25:10,791 --> 01:25:12,666
Look, we're heading for a recession.

1154
01:25:26,791 --> 01:25:29,500
Startup KhelIndia's employees
are asking for government intervention.

1155
01:25:37,250 --> 01:25:39,625
They are claiming they have not received
their salary for the last three months.

1156
01:25:39,708 --> 01:25:43,083
This is the third story like this
about startups this week.

1157
01:25:44,500 --> 01:25:46,000
It's been a month.

1158
01:25:46,083 --> 01:25:47,833
Mr. Kapil will answer all your questions.

1159
01:25:47,916 --> 01:25:49,750
Calm down.

1160
01:25:51,708 --> 01:25:55,083
The company's valuation will go up again.

1161
01:25:57,750 --> 01:25:59,208
Veer, what's wrong with you?

1162
01:25:59,666 --> 01:26:01,291
In here, you're planning
an employee party,

1163
01:26:01,375 --> 01:26:03,958
out there, you spread rumors
that SoftSent is investing nine billion.

1164
01:26:04,916 --> 01:26:07,416
Such rumors are always good.
But a party?

1165
01:26:07,500 --> 01:26:08,791
You see, all eyes are on us.

1166
01:26:13,625 --> 01:26:15,083
But what is our answer to SoftSent?

1167
01:26:20,375 --> 01:26:23,125
-Three billion is not a bad offer.
-So, we admit we were over-valued?

1168
01:26:23,625 --> 01:26:25,041
The market will laugh at us.

1169
01:26:25,708 --> 01:26:26,875
You guys better decide.

1170
01:26:27,208 --> 01:26:29,541
If we let our valuation drop,
it won't stop dropping.

1171
01:26:29,666 --> 01:26:31,333
It's happened to so many startups.

1172
01:27:38,458 --> 01:27:40,083
Sorry, the market's tight.

1173
01:27:40,208 --> 01:27:42,000
Let's see, I'll call you.

1174
01:28:19,208 --> 01:28:20,708
Sir, our App has been copied.

1175
01:28:22,083 --> 01:28:23,000
DeliverKaro.com

1176
01:28:30,125 --> 01:28:31,750
DeliverKaro is nothing.

1177
01:28:31,916 --> 01:28:33,250
They will shut down in six months.

1178
01:28:33,333 --> 01:28:34,791
So, this problem will last six months?

1179
01:28:36,375 --> 01:28:37,625
What if they raise funds?

1180
01:28:38,083 --> 01:28:40,208
So what? Should we throw another party?

1181
01:28:40,291 --> 01:28:43,500
Kapil, we want results, not excuses.

1182
01:28:43,750 --> 01:28:44,833
-Excuses?
-Yes, excuses.

1183
01:28:50,416 --> 01:28:51,750
We need a tangible plan.

1184
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,500
-So--
-We are going to buy DeliverKaro.com

1185
01:30:19,583 --> 01:30:20,666
It's a good offer.

1186
01:30:21,125 --> 01:30:23,791
One of the founders' uncles
is a minister in Indonesia.

1187
01:30:24,791 --> 01:30:27,000
Next month,
we'll start an office in Indonesia.

1188
01:30:27,333 --> 01:30:29,916
-Indonesia is a big market.
-Exactly.

1189
01:30:32,500 --> 01:30:34,333
And at a time like this, in a recession...

1190
01:30:37,291 --> 01:30:38,250
Good for our image.

1191
01:30:39,583 --> 01:30:40,791
Wait a minute.

1192
01:30:41,083 --> 01:30:42,208
Look at their numbers.

1193
01:30:42,666 --> 01:30:43,916
They're going to shut down.

1194
01:30:44,541 --> 01:30:46,500
And we have no experience in Indonesia.

1195
01:30:46,750 --> 01:30:49,375
What's the guarantee
we will find investors after this?

1196
01:30:50,250 --> 01:30:51,916
I think we should take
3 billion from SoftSent.

1197
01:30:58,333 --> 01:31:00,500
The actual plan is in the long term--

1198
01:31:00,833 --> 01:31:03,333
We are not in real estate
to think about long term.

1199
01:31:05,500 --> 01:31:09,000
-In the short term, we'll address losses--
-Then shut down your NGO division.

1200
01:31:09,416 --> 01:31:11,500
Why are we running it at a time like this?

1201
01:31:16,083 --> 01:31:17,958
The NGO division will break even.

1202
01:31:21,041 --> 01:31:22,750
The NGO division will show profits.

1203
01:31:31,416 --> 01:31:34,708
Your old game of fooling investors.

1204
01:31:37,458 --> 01:31:39,083
During the first round
of funding presentation,

1205
01:31:39,166 --> 01:31:41,166
didn't you hide the loss-making villages?

1206
01:31:44,916 --> 01:31:46,458
Speak up. Why are you quiet?

1207
01:31:50,625 --> 01:31:52,750
Your friend Yash, the co-founder...

1208
01:31:53,416 --> 01:31:55,291
Why did he suddenly quit?

1209
01:31:55,875 --> 01:31:58,375
He didn't want you
to pull this con, right?

1210
01:31:59,625 --> 01:32:01,000
What did you always say?

1211
01:32:02,916 --> 01:32:04,375
Now I know why.

1212
01:32:05,125 --> 01:32:06,625
I would've caught you out, right?

1213
01:32:08,791 --> 01:32:11,291
You keep insisting that we should take
SoftSent's three billion.

1214
01:32:11,375 --> 01:32:12,875
Are you getting a kickback?

1215
01:32:40,791 --> 01:32:42,291
I have another option for CEO.

1216
01:32:44,500 --> 01:32:45,500
From UrbanSabzi.

1217
01:32:46,708 --> 01:32:48,041
He just sold his company.

1218
01:32:48,125 --> 01:32:50,541
All his investors profited
at a time like this.

1219
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:51,875
Let's hire him.

1220
01:33:21,250 --> 01:33:22,416
Why did you invite him?

1221
01:33:30,750 --> 01:33:33,333
I thought I was screwed.

1222
01:33:33,666 --> 01:33:35,333
But it's nothing compared to you.

1223
01:33:38,291 --> 01:33:41,166
I thought I was the biggest fool.

1224
01:33:43,083 --> 01:33:44,708
Looks like you're the bigger fool.

1225
01:33:46,500 --> 01:33:48,333
You lectured us so much.

1226
01:33:48,625 --> 01:33:49,916
All about Veer.

1227
01:33:51,333 --> 01:33:53,458
-And now he has nailed you to the cross.
-What the hell?

1228
01:33:53,708 --> 01:33:54,750
Stop it, guys.

1229
01:33:55,500 --> 01:33:57,041
Yash, have you lost your mind?

1230
01:33:57,333 --> 01:33:58,291
What are you doing?

1231
01:34:01,708 --> 01:34:02,541
Tonight...

1232
01:34:03,458 --> 01:34:04,625
let's get rid of Veer.

1233
01:34:09,916 --> 01:34:11,583
All his problems solved in one go.

1234
01:34:13,666 --> 01:34:15,625
Admit it, you are tempted.

1235
01:34:16,625 --> 01:34:20,291
If he dies, it will benefit you.

1236
01:34:21,750 --> 01:34:23,500
You are crazy, seriously.

1237
01:34:25,125 --> 01:34:26,333
Fine, we won't kill him.

1238
01:34:28,375 --> 01:34:31,333
Let's wrap him in a blanket
and give him a good beating tonight.

1239
01:34:31,416 --> 01:34:32,541
That's even better.

1240
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:36,416
We should strip him and get nudies,
and blackmail him all his life.

1241
01:34:36,708 --> 01:34:38,583
And I'm sure he knows his bedroom too.

1242
01:34:38,791 --> 01:34:40,416
They've slept together many times.

1243
01:34:40,541 --> 01:34:41,375
Come on.

1244
01:34:42,250 --> 01:34:44,500
"What has it come to..."

1245
01:34:45,583 --> 01:34:47,333
Don't be shy. Take your pick.

1246
01:34:47,750 --> 01:34:50,041
Murder him or beat him up?

1247
01:34:51,083 --> 01:34:53,291
Murder him or beat him up?

1248
01:34:53,833 --> 01:34:55,458
Don't be shy. Whatever you say.

1249
01:34:56,333 --> 01:34:57,166
Come on.

1250
01:34:58,500 --> 01:34:59,750
Just kill him already.

1251
01:35:01,083 --> 01:35:02,666
He really screwed me this time.

1252
01:35:03,708 --> 01:35:06,208
This fork won't do the job.
Get a proper knife at least.

1253
01:35:06,291 --> 01:35:07,500
Look, Vinay.

1254
01:35:07,875 --> 01:35:09,083
What a guy!

1255
01:35:09,750 --> 01:35:13,125
-He's talking about killing his ex-lover.
-You're such a bastard.

1256
01:35:13,208 --> 01:35:14,750
Bloody criminal.

1257
01:35:15,583 --> 01:35:16,416
Have a beer.

1258
01:35:27,416 --> 01:35:28,333
Open sky.

1259
01:35:29,541 --> 01:35:30,625
Cheap booze.

1260
01:35:31,875 --> 01:35:32,708
Shitty friends.

1261
01:35:33,625 --> 01:35:34,833
What more do you need?

1262
01:35:39,125 --> 01:35:41,708
After the Richa episode,
I thought that was the end.

1263
01:35:44,375 --> 01:35:45,333
But I bounced back.

1264
01:35:46,625 --> 01:35:47,500
Why?

1265
01:35:49,583 --> 01:35:50,916
Because I had all of this.

1266
01:35:53,500 --> 01:35:54,333
The three of us.

1267
01:35:55,916 --> 01:35:56,750
And now...

1268
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,000
You stop all this CTO drama.

1269
01:36:03,833 --> 01:36:04,666
And you...

1270
01:36:05,250 --> 01:36:07,000
You thought I was talking nonsense,

1271
01:36:07,458 --> 01:36:10,250
about desire, attachment, ambition.

1272
01:36:11,291 --> 01:36:12,458
But look at yourself now.

1273
01:36:13,250 --> 01:36:14,166
Let it go.

1274
01:36:16,333 --> 01:36:17,250
No, man.

1275
01:36:19,458 --> 01:36:20,416
This is my company.

1276
01:36:22,458 --> 01:36:23,666
He can't do this to me.

1277
01:36:27,166 --> 01:36:29,041
You were planning to cut Veer out,

1278
01:36:29,500 --> 01:36:31,958
but now Veer is cutting you out,
and you can't stop crying.

1279
01:36:33,250 --> 01:36:34,375
And you...

1280
01:36:34,458 --> 01:36:35,833
When are you quitting alcohol?

1281
01:36:36,333 --> 01:36:37,458
Believe me, I tried.

1282
01:36:37,916 --> 01:36:39,041
But I couldn't do it.

1283
01:36:39,416 --> 01:36:42,583
And then I thought deeply about it,
and I realized why.

1284
01:36:43,208 --> 01:36:44,541
Alcohol is not the problem.

1285
01:36:45,541 --> 01:36:48,458
The problem is 'too much alcohol.'

1286
01:36:49,500 --> 01:36:51,250
Believe me, it makes sense.

1287
01:36:52,083 --> 01:36:55,041
-I see.
-Alcohol is not the problem.

1288
01:36:55,916 --> 01:36:58,375
The problem is too much alcohol.

1289
01:36:59,500 --> 01:37:03,500
First, escape velocity,
and now life philosophy.

1290
01:37:04,833 --> 01:37:06,416
You were better off as a techie.

1291
01:37:06,791 --> 01:37:09,708
And you were better as Veer's lackey.

1292
01:37:10,625 --> 01:37:11,666
Bastard.

1293
01:37:14,875 --> 01:37:15,708
Well...

1294
01:37:16,666 --> 01:37:18,041
Thanks for the free booze.

1295
01:37:19,541 --> 01:37:20,791
-See you, guys.
-Hey?

1296
01:37:21,500 --> 01:37:23,791
-Stay. Where are you going?
-No, man.

1297
01:37:24,458 --> 01:37:27,000
Friendship is not the problem.

1298
01:37:28,250 --> 01:37:30,166
The problem is 'too much friendship.'

1299
01:37:31,125 --> 01:37:32,208
Stay, man.

1300
01:37:32,291 --> 01:37:34,125
Remember that song you always sang,

1301
01:37:34,208 --> 01:37:35,875
"I have left those streets behind."

1302
01:37:36,416 --> 01:37:37,416
Same.

1303
01:37:37,666 --> 01:37:38,500
Listen, man.

1304
01:37:40,333 --> 01:37:41,250
Let it go.

1305
01:37:42,333 --> 01:37:43,250
He'll need time.

1306
01:38:06,958 --> 01:38:07,833
No.

1307
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:13,500
You said there's a job opening
in your friend's company.

1308
01:38:14,500 --> 01:38:18,833
It doesn't have to be as CTO,
anything is fine.

1309
01:38:21,166 --> 01:38:22,291
Fine. I'll arrange it.

1310
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,333
The Board has decided
to shut down the NGO division.

1311
01:38:48,791 --> 01:38:51,000
The NGO division
is the soul of this place.

1312
01:38:51,458 --> 01:38:53,416
It's where all this started.

1313
01:39:01,750 --> 01:39:03,000
Forget the NGO division.

1314
01:39:08,125 --> 01:39:09,083
You're still the CEO.

1315
01:39:11,250 --> 01:39:12,208
Be happy with that.

1316
01:39:59,791 --> 01:40:01,750
No. Those are basic.

1317
01:40:13,125 --> 01:40:14,875
Do you have any experience in those?

1318
01:40:20,708 --> 01:40:21,541
Not a problem.

1319
01:40:22,166 --> 01:40:25,250
I've promised Mr. Vinay,
so we'll find another role.

1320
01:40:27,041 --> 01:40:29,416
Our fresher's trainee program
starts next week.

1321
01:40:29,500 --> 01:40:30,791
You can attend that.

1322
01:40:31,375 --> 01:40:32,375
With freshers?

1323
01:40:33,125 --> 01:40:36,208
That seems to be the only option
since your skills are outdated.

1324
01:40:37,500 --> 01:40:39,416
But there's nothing wrong
in fresher's training.

1325
01:42:45,541 --> 01:42:48,625
It's no surprise
that I wanted to commit suicide.

1326
01:42:50,250 --> 01:42:52,083
I'd been headed there for a while.

1327
01:42:53,125 --> 01:42:55,625
What is shocking is that
even when I was about to jump,

1328
01:42:55,708 --> 01:42:57,375
I didn't call either of you!

1329
01:42:57,958 --> 01:43:00,583
Think about that.
That's what our friendship has come to.

1330
01:43:03,541 --> 01:43:04,416
I...

1331
01:43:05,458 --> 01:43:06,666
would've died yesterday.

1332
01:43:07,708 --> 01:43:09,166
And you two wouldn't have known.

1333
01:43:09,250 --> 01:43:11,291
Are you crazy? What you're saying?

1334
01:43:11,375 --> 01:43:14,041
-No
-Stop talking. Shut up, you fool.

1335
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:33,666
Do you know whom I finally called?

1336
01:43:53,916 --> 01:43:55,458
That last number is Yash.

1337
01:44:02,333 --> 01:44:04,333
I've never seen you so silent before.

1338
01:44:19,375 --> 01:44:20,375
What for?

1339
01:44:20,458 --> 01:44:21,708
-Yash is my friend too.
-No.

1340
01:44:35,583 --> 01:44:38,541
You know, the way Yash scared you...

1341
01:44:39,083 --> 01:44:40,125
you had scared me.

1342
01:44:45,625 --> 01:44:48,916
But I never imagined
I'd be so happy to see you back.

1343
01:45:11,208 --> 01:45:12,041
I'll be back.

1344
01:45:12,375 --> 01:45:13,333
I'll see you soon.

1345
01:45:17,375 --> 01:45:18,375
I want to resign.

1346
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:27,666
Just one small condition.

1347
01:45:29,750 --> 01:45:31,000
I want the NGO division.

1348
01:45:34,500 --> 01:45:35,333
Yes, I know.

1349
01:45:35,875 --> 01:45:38,250
It's making losses but I still want it.

1350
01:45:53,416 --> 01:45:54,250
Fine.

1351
01:45:55,291 --> 01:45:56,666
Why would we have a problem?

1352
01:46:40,083 --> 01:46:42,666
-We can put it up here.
-No. Fine, you do it.

1353
01:46:43,291 --> 01:46:45,125
-You can't put it there.
-It's too short.

1354
01:46:47,166 --> 01:46:49,291
No, I measured it before buying.

1355
01:46:51,708 --> 01:46:53,166
My Mother Teresa.

1356
01:46:55,041 --> 01:46:55,875
Hey, buddy.

1357
01:46:56,625 --> 01:47:00,291
GPS only tells you the routes and traffic,
but not where the potholes are.

1358
01:47:01,541 --> 01:47:03,041
There should be an app for that, right?

1359
01:47:03,125 --> 01:47:05,541
Actually, there must be scope
for pregnancy-related apps too.

1360
01:47:05,625 --> 01:47:07,500
-Right, Jaya?
-There you go again.

1361
01:47:30,458 --> 01:47:31,333
It was Yash's idea.

1362
01:47:32,041 --> 01:47:34,833
Why only medicines,
we can bring doctors too.

1363
01:47:35,833 --> 01:47:38,500
It's been only one month
since we launched this idea,

1364
01:47:38,666 --> 01:47:40,583
3000 doctors have already registered.

1365
01:47:42,083 --> 01:47:43,958
You've got to take these bugs out.

1366
01:47:44,416 --> 01:47:46,958
-This is our local development center.
-Re-do the coding.

1367
01:47:47,041 --> 01:47:49,625
-I won't tolerate this. Get it?
-And that is Mr. Perfectionist.

1368
01:47:57,500 --> 01:48:00,791
You still didn't know how to climb a wall.

1369
01:48:11,625 --> 01:48:12,541
Open sky.

1370
01:48:13,583 --> 01:48:14,458
Cheap liquor.

1371
01:48:15,083 --> 01:48:15,916
Shitty friends.

1372
01:48:17,333 --> 01:48:18,458
What more do you need?

1373
01:48:30,208 --> 01:48:32,208
