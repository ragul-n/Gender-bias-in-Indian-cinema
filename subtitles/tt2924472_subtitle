00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:18,610
Farhan... the case is solved.

3
00:04:18,613 --> 00:04:22,212
I've found out the culprit. Yes Farhan.

4
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:56,660
Do you have a cigarette?

5
00:04:57,710 --> 00:04:58,960
I never used to smoke.

6
00:04:59,418 --> 00:05:06,418
Sorry! Name... Again I...

7
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:11,960
Farhan, your closest
friend, police commissioner.

8
00:05:28,251 --> 00:05:30,052
This is where, fourteen days before.

9
00:05:43,751 --> 00:05:49,043
One refrigerator fell off to the
road, during a house shifting.

10
00:05:49,835 --> 00:05:51,751
Your jeep was just, behind it.

11
00:05:52,751 --> 00:05:55,051
All of a sudden,
when you turned the vehicle...

12
00:05:55,751 --> 00:05:57,501
it had hit there, and toppled over.

13
00:06:05,751 --> 00:06:09,335
As I told you, you were
talking over the phone, with me.

14
00:06:15,043 --> 00:06:20,376
Good evening sir, I'll come,
by what time sir? Okay.

15
00:06:21,418 --> 00:06:24,250
Yes. Got discharged today only.

16
00:06:24,251 --> 00:06:31,251
Will be able to take charge, with in
two days. Yes sir, I understand. Sir.

17
00:06:38,918 --> 00:06:43,250
State government and
media is closely watching...

18
00:06:43,251 --> 00:06:45,418
on murder of a police officer.

19
00:06:46,085 --> 00:06:51,585
There was, lots of pressure on us,
on both, you and me. Not was. It is!

20
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:53,851
When you were in the hospital,

21
00:06:53,853 --> 00:06:57,537
- there were innumerable phone calls
and mails, on the status of the case.

22
00:06:57,539 --> 00:06:59,389
It was in the mist of us, everywhere.

23
00:06:59,543 --> 00:07:03,335
If we do not reach a conclusion,
that will affect our carrier.

24
00:07:04,751 --> 00:07:08,751
Among the superiors, few
were apprehensive on that.

25
00:07:12,626 --> 00:07:17,685
But you had solved that case,
just before the accident.

26
00:07:19,226 --> 00:07:21,792
From where we departed
on meeting, to till here...

27
00:07:21,793 --> 00:07:23,584
in between this distance.

28
00:07:23,585 --> 00:07:26,635
Some where there is a vital
evidence, which you had found out.

29
00:07:27,293 --> 00:07:30,168
A vital clue... The whole
state was following this case...

30
00:07:30,335 --> 00:07:31,459
which was proven also.

31
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:33,918
Before, bringing it to light, what it is,

32
00:07:34,085 --> 00:07:38,043
- before revealing
the culprit... Accident!

33
00:07:42,668 --> 00:07:46,251
I don't remember. Nothing at all.

34
00:07:46,418 --> 00:07:51,251
On that drive, there are no
incoming calls, in your call list.

35
00:07:51,918 --> 00:07:54,251
The last outgoing call, was for me.

36
00:07:56,835 --> 00:08:00,625
For a twenty minutes distance, you
took, more than forty five minutes.

37
00:08:00,626 --> 00:08:03,376
Which means, in between
something had happened?

38
00:08:04,043 --> 00:08:08,918
One halt, one deviation,
or maybe not, a slowing down.

39
00:08:10,418 --> 00:08:14,085
Whatever it may be, in that gap,
this case has got proven.

40
00:08:42,001 --> 00:08:46,043
10 A, this was inside
your cars dash board.

41
00:08:49,793 --> 00:08:51,917
Take the bag and
take sir, to the flat.

42
00:08:51,918 --> 00:08:52,501
Yes, sir.

43
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:56,110
All the medicines are in the bag,

44
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:58,835
the timings are written
on it. Do not forget.

45
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:05,061
Nobody should be allowed to go
upstairs, till I come. Is it clear to you?

46
00:09:06,543 --> 00:09:08,460
He is the guard here... Shivan.

47
00:09:13,918 --> 00:09:17,668
This is for you, take it. Your sister.

48
00:09:24,293 --> 00:09:27,085
One accident. Now
you are perfectly all right.

49
00:09:27,418 --> 00:09:30,043
In front of all, expect
me and Doctors.

50
00:09:30,251 --> 00:09:33,960
That's why no visitors
were allowed inside hospital.

51
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:35,835
Tell her, you'll come tomorrow.

52
00:09:42,543 --> 00:09:43,543
Hallo,

53
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:47,793
Here... At the flat.

54
00:09:49,418 --> 00:09:55,668
Yea, I had food.
From a nearby restaurant.

55
00:10:00,876 --> 00:10:01,710
Subway.

56
00:10:04,585 --> 00:10:06,335
I'll come tomorrow.

57
00:10:11,168 --> 00:10:14,168
Hallo, you have your
food and go to bed.

58
00:10:14,418 --> 00:10:17,668
I will be around ten
thirty, eleven, must visit SQ.

59
00:10:18,418 --> 00:10:21,960
No problem, with him,
nothing, I'll come.

60
00:10:25,085 --> 00:10:29,001
Do I have to come? There is
a meeting, already late now.

61
00:10:29,168 --> 00:10:31,959
If you, want me to come.
Not required.

62
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:35,835
We'll talk, till then, sleep well.

63
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:42,960
If you need anything, have
you fed my phone number?

64
00:10:51,043 --> 00:10:54,668
There... In that flat, is
there anyone, along with me?

65
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:59,960
I mean, do I live with some body?

66
00:11:01,376 --> 00:11:01,876
No.

67
00:11:18,251 --> 00:11:21,709
At Chellavanoor, there is a
Skyline, may be there.

68
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:24,501
No, it is here, in this area
that is what I was told.

69
00:11:24,751 --> 00:11:28,835
Here, other than
this, there is nothing...

70
00:11:32,751 --> 00:11:36,001
Excuse me sir. Can you
tell me, where this address is?

71
00:13:16,793 --> 00:13:18,785
Hi Antony, I had
come to the hospital.

72
00:13:18,993 --> 00:13:22,243
When you get discharged, will
come to your house. You take rest.

73
00:13:22,251 --> 00:13:25,376
Tony... Man, I came
know about the news now.

74
00:13:25,585 --> 00:13:29,293
I'm so sorry, I'm in Qatar, and
I'll catch you, once I'm back.

75
00:13:31,293 --> 00:13:35,376
Kamal from Hyderabad, all of our
prayers and wishes are with you.

76
00:13:37,251 --> 00:13:41,292
This is all our curse, we pray that
you must not walk, from now on!

77
00:13:41,293 --> 00:13:43,335
God gave you this.

78
00:14:16,293 --> 00:14:17,593
Is it a good time to talk.

79
00:14:20,376 --> 00:14:22,709
Sorry, never intended,
to talk this matter...

80
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:24,160
soon as you came, discharged.

81
00:14:24,626 --> 00:14:27,417
As you know, after,
yesterday's incident,

82
00:14:27,418 --> 00:14:31,126
everyone over here was shaken.
Especially ladies and children.

83
00:14:31,543 --> 00:14:32,835
Sir, as you know.

84
00:14:33,001 --> 00:14:35,501
The rule, for only family
was nullified, just because...

85
00:14:35,668 --> 00:14:38,718
you were a police officer
and there by the safety at the flat.

86
00:14:38,835 --> 00:14:43,085
But this is... Either someone will
come, to assault you, like yesterday.

87
00:14:43,251 --> 00:14:46,917
Or else, they will come threatening.
If not, nothing other than this.

88
00:14:46,918 --> 00:14:49,268
After drinking, sir, you
will create havoc here.

89
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:52,344
Last month, after drinking,
you were using foul language...

90
00:14:52,418 --> 00:14:54,835
To the wife of Narayanan sir.

91
00:14:55,085 --> 00:14:56,750
But we did not mention that.

92
00:14:56,751 --> 00:15:00,167
That is all previous issues. Start
the topic, on why we are here.

93
00:15:00,168 --> 00:15:03,376
But we have to mention the past,
which is why we came here.

94
00:15:03,443 --> 00:15:06,592
Sir, if you have a visitor,
without writing on the register...

95
00:15:06,593 --> 00:15:08,735
you straight away enter.

96
00:15:08,901 --> 00:15:10,400
Isn't that correct Shivan!

97
00:15:10,401 --> 00:15:12,701
On telling him to write,
he will bounce on me.

98
00:15:12,768 --> 00:15:18,101
We are not used to these kind of things, we believe...
without much complications in life, we must move on.

99
00:15:18,118 --> 00:15:21,560
So, what we have to tell is.
Not this association alone...

100
00:15:21,626 --> 00:15:23,710
Everybody in this flat,
we are fed up.

101
00:15:23,876 --> 00:15:25,427
Sir, you must vacate from here.

102
00:15:55,501 --> 00:16:02,001
That shop... Your routine halt to
buy cigarettes. Go and get one.

103
00:16:05,293 --> 00:16:08,826
See, whether, you get something,
from his conversation. Something.

104
00:16:08,918 --> 00:16:13,751
Maybe, you might have stopped here,
before the accident, drive.

105
00:16:16,751 --> 00:16:22,001
In certain case, will get a big, clue
from, the words spoken by some.

106
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:30,168
Which is the cigarette?

107
00:16:31,668 --> 00:16:33,768
The moment, he sees
you, he'll take it out.

108
00:16:56,418 --> 00:16:57,835
Hallo.
I'm Sajeev.

109
00:16:58,460 --> 00:16:59,417
Who?

110
00:16:59,418 --> 00:17:01,042
Sajeev, from Asianet.

111
00:17:01,043 --> 00:17:03,494
Knew you are discharged,
as I was busy, running...

112
00:17:03,496 --> 00:17:05,587
I could not come to
hospital and meet you.

113
00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:08,172
Sir, there is a rumor
that investigation is over...

114
00:17:08,174 --> 00:17:11,707
Home minister, also, hinted on that.

115
00:17:11,751 --> 00:17:15,460
If it is so, the first information,
should be given to us sir.

116
00:17:39,085 --> 00:17:40,710
When did you come from hospital?

117
00:17:40,918 --> 00:17:41,835
Yesterday.

118
00:17:42,001 --> 00:17:44,951
Anyway, good thing you came
out from there, morning itself.

119
00:17:44,954 --> 00:17:47,754
Some kind of tidiness is there,
as he had not gone there.

120
00:17:49,418 --> 00:17:51,168
Can pay only on first.

121
00:17:52,293 --> 00:17:55,793
Hey! Tony, you are back! How
come, you haven't called?

122
00:17:56,126 --> 00:17:58,876
I was only discharged yesterday.

123
00:17:59,418 --> 00:18:02,260
Opened two more international
services, crazy schedule.

124
00:18:02,262 --> 00:18:05,071
For the last two weeks,
literally I was in the sky.

125
00:18:05,126 --> 00:18:08,460
Couldn't come to hospital,
but you look good man!

126
00:18:09,126 --> 00:18:10,001
Thanks.

127
00:18:10,543 --> 00:18:12,375
Thanks, that is new!

128
00:18:12,376 --> 00:18:14,334
Anyway one o'clock to Qatar.

129
00:18:14,335 --> 00:18:16,917
Got to rush, pop in,
I'll drop you some place.

130
00:18:16,918 --> 00:18:18,917
No, I got the vehicle.

131
00:18:18,918 --> 00:18:21,751
I'll drop in, once I land.
It's been a while.

132
00:18:45,543 --> 00:18:46,460
Who was that?

133
00:18:47,585 --> 00:18:48,460
I don't know.

134
00:18:51,585 --> 00:18:53,136
Who called you, over the phone?

135
00:18:53,293 --> 00:18:57,292
One TV guy, Sajeev.
Enquired about the case...

136
00:18:57,293 --> 00:18:59,876
morning also, there was
a call from a journalist.

137
00:19:01,085 --> 00:19:03,943
Don't answer anything, they
will dig deep. Ignore them...

138
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:06,010
saying you are in a
meeting or something.

139
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,399
Did he say anything?

140
00:19:10,402 --> 00:19:12,651
Whatever, he says I
will not understand that.

141
00:19:12,653 --> 00:19:14,603
Because, I don't know
what is happening.

142
00:19:14,718 --> 00:19:19,702
On one side, somebody is coming to attack,
on the other hand, telling me to vacate from the flat.

143
00:19:19,704 --> 00:19:21,338
Some are telling I'm a drunkard.

144
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:25,840
You tell me, to report it to you,
what that is heard from the streets?

145
00:19:25,918 --> 00:19:27,251
I feel like a puppet.

146
00:19:27,418 --> 00:19:28,043
Relax!

147
00:19:28,293 --> 00:19:31,250
Give it some time, had
started the investigation,

148
00:19:31,251 --> 00:19:33,125
...on men who had come yesterday.

149
00:19:33,126 --> 00:19:35,710
Not who they are, but
I need to know, why?

150
00:19:35,876 --> 00:19:38,250
Not pointing people around me.

151
00:19:38,251 --> 00:19:42,376
But who they are to me. I don't
know, one, who is in front of me,

152
00:19:42,543 --> 00:19:43,710
...is a friend or foe.

153
00:19:44,085 --> 00:19:45,168
Including you!

154
00:19:50,043 --> 00:19:53,793
Only questions are before me.

155
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:06,835
Must find answers for all,
they only will I know who I'm.

156
00:20:15,793 --> 00:20:20,960
Now I need an answer, for
a big question before me.

00:22:20,585 --> 00:22:23,376
he served at QV
branch at Bombay.

170
00:22:23,543 --> 00:22:24,417
Presently...

171
00:22:24,418 --> 00:22:27,519
he is working as Assistant
Commissioner of Police Mattancherry.

172
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:31,917
May I now, welcome the honorable
Governor to present Medals...

173
00:22:31,918 --> 00:22:34,668
and certificate of
Honor to Aryan John.

174
00:23:20,418 --> 00:23:24,084
I was never a good police
officer and I don't know how a...

175
00:23:24,085 --> 00:23:26,501
good police officer should be.

176
00:23:27,168 --> 00:23:32,750
I was often, astonished, on thinking
how an IPS label came to me.

177
00:23:32,751 --> 00:23:35,959
However, it may be, everywhere
I go it is never more than...

178
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,435
a premium status symbols.

179
00:23:37,437 --> 00:23:40,462
Nothing more than this, I had not
shown any undue respect...

180
00:23:40,465 --> 00:23:41,615
to this position.

181
00:23:43,043 --> 00:23:44,584
On standing here,

182
00:23:44,585 --> 00:23:48,625
it is the biggest honor one
can achieve in the police force.

183
00:23:48,626 --> 00:23:53,668
I know myself, for a below
average, officer like me, this is...

184
00:23:59,251 --> 00:24:00,001
[Away]!

185
00:24:45,418 --> 00:24:47,835
Is it not recorded?
No sir.

186
00:24:51,751 --> 00:24:52,601
Take the vehicle!

187
00:25:30,085 --> 00:25:31,168
Saji on the right.

188
00:25:31,585 --> 00:25:32,735
James on the top floor.

189
00:27:26,776 --> 00:27:29,835
Shall we go somewhere? I will
abstain, from here for few days.

190
00:27:29,837 --> 00:27:32,904
Do you think, he will go from
your heart, if you do like that?

191
00:27:34,906 --> 00:27:37,090
He will be there in
every corners of life...

192
00:27:37,093 --> 00:27:39,218
even if, it is here, or
where ever we are.

193
00:27:39,876 --> 00:27:42,426
There will be lot of moments,
which he had given us.

194
00:27:43,251 --> 00:27:47,501
We cannot escape, from it.
No matter, how far we go from it.

195
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:52,626
I cannot think,
he is no more, as a reality.

196
00:27:55,876 --> 00:27:56,751
I need to know...

197
00:27:58,043 --> 00:27:59,835
I'm never a good police officer...

198
00:28:00,543 --> 00:28:04,668
and I don't know how a
good police officer should be.

199
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:11,750
I was often, astonished, on thinking
how an IPS label came to me.

200
00:28:11,751 --> 00:28:14,000
However, it may be, everywhere...

201
00:28:14,001 --> 00:28:16,668
I go it is never more than
a premium status symbols.

202
00:28:19,543 --> 00:28:21,084
On standing here...

203
00:28:21,085 --> 00:28:25,625
it is the biggest honor one can
achieve in the police force.

204
00:28:25,626 --> 00:28:29,501
I know myself, for a below
average, officer like me, this is...

205
00:28:42,418 --> 00:28:46,418
A gun shot piercing the heart,
bullet entered through the left chest.

206
00:28:46,751 --> 00:28:51,001
Exit through the lower back.
Lungs had also been penetrated.

207
00:28:52,251 --> 00:28:55,251
On the wound, the residue
of the gun powder is too low.

208
00:28:55,418 --> 00:28:58,960
This accounts for a
long distance firing.

209
00:28:59,126 --> 00:29:02,276
You might have got the bullet from
the crime scene, haven't you?

210
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:06,210
No sir, cartridge is missing
searched lot of times everywhere.

211
00:29:06,585 --> 00:29:09,293
Checked outside the stadium,
in a fifty meter radius.

212
00:29:11,043 --> 00:29:14,250
If the cartridge moved
above fifty meters...

213
00:29:14,251 --> 00:29:16,168
it will not be lost on that stampede.

214
00:29:16,335 --> 00:29:19,668
I think that would have been
removed from the scene, by someone.

215
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:23,084
How long, did our force take,
to secure the entire scene?

216
00:29:23,085 --> 00:29:23,835
Almost an hour.

217
00:29:23,838 --> 00:29:27,588
Without finding the cartridge, we
cannot confirm, what kind of gun was used.

218
00:29:27,589 --> 00:29:31,163
Sir, let's do research on fire arms.
From the wound in the victim's body.

219
00:29:31,165 --> 00:29:33,457
We can identify, what is
the kind of gun used.

220
00:29:33,585 --> 00:29:35,967
I've read about it and
I can start today.

221
00:29:35,968 --> 00:29:38,459
That is all, simply written
in the book, madam.

222
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:40,475
In many cases whichever
may be the gun.

223
00:29:40,476 --> 00:29:43,042
- The wound on the
victim's body will appear similar.

224
00:29:43,043 --> 00:29:45,934
We cannot confirm anything,
without getting the cartridge.

225
00:29:45,935 --> 00:29:47,034
But the victim...

226
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:49,768
What the hell? Victim... victim... Don't
you know he has got a name?

227
00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:51,370
Did you people forget that also?

228
00:29:51,626 --> 00:29:55,626
He is not just a 'bloody victim' show
the same respect once he was alive!

229
00:29:55,835 --> 00:29:57,335
Is that clear?
Yes sir.

230
00:29:59,285 --> 00:30:02,068
Do you have the list of men,
who attended the function?

231
00:30:02,135 --> 00:30:07,959
Yes, 127 invites, including VIP's.
Then public, between 200 and 300.

232
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:09,860
Take the statement from all,

233
00:30:10,085 --> 00:30:13,960
check the video footage, and
identify everyone from the public.

234
00:30:14,251 --> 00:30:17,251
VIP's and family members
I will meet personally...

235
00:30:17,418 --> 00:30:18,959
check the rest of the people.

236
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,125
Some guests are out of state. Sir.

237
00:30:21,126 --> 00:30:25,168
Where ever they are, I must get the
statements of all, within three days.

238
00:30:25,335 --> 00:30:25,835
Yes sir.

239
00:30:27,876 --> 00:30:29,917
As per the experts...

240
00:30:29,918 --> 00:30:33,293
the cartridge, had come from a
distance of 100 to 200 meters.

241
00:30:33,668 --> 00:30:37,085
From a highly sophisticated
rifle, by an expert shooter.

242
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:45,167
What he said is, from the
angle of the wound in the body...

243
00:30:45,168 --> 00:30:46,519
and the distance mentioned.

244
00:30:46,522 --> 00:30:51,472
It might be from a building on the left side of the ground...
and that too from fifth or sixth floor.

245
00:30:51,474 --> 00:30:52,899
In that case we are not mistaken.

246
00:30:52,902 --> 00:30:57,819
No. Exactly, from a building in that
position, a person had ran from there.

247
00:31:14,385 --> 00:31:17,925
This a building on dispute among
the brothers, no one is staying here.

248
00:31:17,926 --> 00:31:19,243
Get the details of them.

249
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:21,550
Sir, on the day, when
the incident took, place.

250
00:31:21,551 --> 00:31:24,250
- There are people, who had seen
that Roy, in the nearby junction.

251
00:31:24,251 --> 00:31:25,167
Which Roy?

252
00:31:25,168 --> 00:31:26,868
A usual guy, in the gangster list.

253
00:33:33,585 --> 00:33:36,585
Don't sir, please,
he is not feeling well.

254
00:33:36,751 --> 00:33:39,343
What were you doing
at Atlantis junction on 15th?

255
00:33:40,426 --> 00:33:42,225
That is where my sister's house is.

256
00:33:42,226 --> 00:33:43,351
Your sister?

257
00:33:43,685 --> 00:33:45,334
From there, where did you go?

258
00:33:45,335 --> 00:33:48,585
Sir, he came straight to here.

259
00:33:51,585 --> 00:33:55,210
You answer only when you
are questioned, understand!

260
00:33:57,085 --> 00:33:59,960
From there, straight to
infra building, is it not?

261
00:34:02,251 --> 00:34:04,250
Who were there, along
with you, tell me.

262
00:34:04,251 --> 00:34:07,451
I had seen all this, many times, don't
try to put the things in my mouth...

263
00:34:07,518 --> 00:34:08,619
what you have in mind.

264
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:11,501
Sir, no need.

265
00:34:16,001 --> 00:34:20,043
You! Don't touch her.
You will never get up!

266
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:28,710
What did you say?

267
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:31,376
Leave us alone sir.

268
00:34:31,543 --> 00:34:32,593
How is that touching?

269
00:34:34,626 --> 00:34:35,668
Is it like this?

270
00:34:41,043 --> 00:34:42,750
Or is it like this?

271
00:34:42,751 --> 00:34:44,251
Please, don't do anything?

272
00:34:44,876 --> 00:34:46,251
Or is it like this?

273
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:53,793
Pull him to the jeep!

274
00:34:54,376 --> 00:34:55,418
Come here!

275
00:34:58,876 --> 00:34:59,376
She too!

276
00:35:21,543 --> 00:35:22,501
Rakhi...

277
00:35:26,751 --> 00:35:30,692
Go and meet the residents in that
flat, see whether you get some details.

278
00:35:30,693 --> 00:35:31,718
Yes sir.

279
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,580
Call that, Sudhakaran also with you.

280
00:35:33,583 --> 00:35:35,208
I will go, alone.

281
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:41,168
Had got lot of experience,
no need of ego.

282
00:35:55,751 --> 00:35:59,960
It seems, no touch anywhere. Foot
prints are deliberately removed.

283
00:36:00,751 --> 00:36:04,459
See this, sir, chili powder, so that
sniffer dogs don't get the smell.

284
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:06,750
Whoever it may be, he
is not the first timer.

285
00:36:06,751 --> 00:36:10,335
...If it is for first time, there is an
enormous planning behind this.

286
00:36:17,085 --> 00:36:20,584
That morning, when
that police officer got killed,

287
00:36:20,585 --> 00:36:24,417
son and family was
returning to UK on that day.

288
00:36:24,418 --> 00:36:27,750
So, setting the dinner was delayed.

289
00:36:27,751 --> 00:36:32,168
While I was standing here, I
noticed a car parked over there.

290
00:36:32,335 --> 00:36:33,292
About what time?

291
00:36:33,293 --> 00:36:36,959
Around 11, 11:30.
After the son had left from here.

292
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:41,500
By around, one o'clock,
when I came to store room.

293
00:36:41,501 --> 00:36:45,376
That car was still there. I didn't see
anybody getting in or getting down.

294
00:36:45,543 --> 00:36:50,210
But I was just thinking,
why that car is there at that time.

295
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:56,135
In the morning, when you checked,
hadn't been the car over there?

296
00:36:56,137 --> 00:36:57,020
No.

297
00:36:59,543 --> 00:37:03,835
The number of the car, what
type of car, anything like that?

298
00:37:04,085 --> 00:37:08,335
No, I didn't pay attention, to
all that. It was a big green car.

299
00:37:14,376 --> 00:37:18,960
Small eyes... Very small.

300
00:37:25,585 --> 00:37:26,251
No.

301
00:37:29,585 --> 00:37:30,501
Thicker mustache.

302
00:37:36,085 --> 00:37:37,668
A boarder face than this.

303
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:41,626
An oval shaped.

304
00:37:52,501 --> 00:37:53,335
YES:

305
00:37:54,918 --> 00:37:55,960
That's him.

306
00:38:06,126 --> 00:38:09,001
Came here, just wanted
to see the armory test.

307
00:38:17,251 --> 00:38:20,918
Are you investigating on me,
because of a silly fight...

308
00:38:21,085 --> 00:38:24,126
with that person at the party?

309
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:28,376
I'm interested on your car!

310
00:38:33,626 --> 00:38:37,960
Well maintained, no one
will say, it is 2005 model.

311
00:38:38,751 --> 00:38:42,001
Apart from Captain, does
anyone else use this car?

312
00:38:42,293 --> 00:38:45,876
A week before, around 14th or 15th.

313
00:38:55,751 --> 00:38:58,876
No body uses this car, except me.

314
00:38:59,376 --> 00:39:03,418
Do you know a Roy?
A notorious hoodlum in Cochin.

315
00:39:05,418 --> 00:39:06,126
No.

316
00:39:11,751 --> 00:39:15,960
That is my vehicle. What
is your program on this 20th?

317
00:39:17,376 --> 00:39:20,376
Must come to camp
office at ten o'clock.

318
00:39:20,835 --> 00:39:25,001
I will get the permission from
superiors, we will have coffee.

319
00:39:35,585 --> 00:39:37,292
Have you been to Bombay...

320
00:39:37,293 --> 00:39:38,443
...two months back?

321
00:39:38,493 --> 00:39:41,001
Seems like, have seen
your name at passenger list.

322
00:39:41,003 --> 00:39:43,369
I had gone. Parents are over there.

323
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,835
During the time, you were there.

324
00:39:49,501 --> 00:39:51,351
Have you contacted
a person like this?

325
00:39:53,543 --> 00:39:54,668
What the ****

326
00:40:10,251 --> 00:40:13,626
I gave got Roy, for
interrogating for three days.

327
00:40:14,751 --> 00:40:16,960
Seems will get some
details from him.

328
00:40:17,526 --> 00:40:19,018
That navy guy?

329
00:40:21,018 --> 00:40:24,575
Still on the track, whether, they had
seen, any issues had taken place,

330
00:40:24,577 --> 00:40:27,452
between Aryan and him.

331
00:40:30,835 --> 00:40:35,835
Is his life so much complicated?
I thought he is just a child.

332
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:37,960
I have interacted in that way.

333
00:40:38,168 --> 00:40:43,085
Today is his engagement
date, with Rebecca.

334
00:40:47,293 --> 00:40:49,126
Frankly asking...

335
00:40:50,251 --> 00:40:54,876
he used to complain, he doesn't
get enough respect from the family.

336
00:40:56,043 --> 00:40:58,543
Any issues had occurred here,
on the basis of that.

337
00:40:58,918 --> 00:41:01,918
No. when we find
wrong things, scold him...

338
00:41:02,085 --> 00:41:04,418
which was never dis-respect.

339
00:41:04,668 --> 00:41:07,418
Some of his activities,
some companies of him.

340
00:41:26,918 --> 00:41:29,251
Rebbecca here. Told me to call you.

341
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:32,851
When can I meet Rebbecca?

342
00:41:33,518 --> 00:41:36,850
Right now I'm in Bombay, today
afternoon flight I will return.

343
00:41:36,851 --> 00:41:38,560
Okay. I'll contact you.

344
00:41:40,918 --> 00:41:44,959
Sir, statements of whom,
attended the function.

345
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,460
There is nothing unusual.

346
00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:50,292
This is the initial investigation
report of Hyderabad police.

347
00:41:50,293 --> 00:41:54,301
Their stand is, the shootout which occurred there...
cannot be connected to this.

348
00:41:54,835 --> 00:41:57,786
That is because, they want
to free from this responsibility.

349
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:04,085
As an expert shooter, we cannot
deny the involvement of Maoist group.

350
00:42:04,543 --> 00:42:06,918
That too, they had
used the most modern rifle

351
00:42:07,126 --> 00:42:09,560
If the Hyderabad police,
doesn't cooperate.

352
00:42:09,563 --> 00:42:12,988
Then we will have to ask, for the
assistance of a centralized agency.

353
00:42:13,010 --> 00:42:13,835
Okay sir.

354
00:42:17,093 --> 00:42:18,500
This is from Chennai...

355
00:42:18,501 --> 00:42:21,202
and Hyderabad, from the
other metros, it is on its way.

356
00:42:46,585 --> 00:42:49,335
This is not the one, he was more...

357
00:42:56,626 --> 00:43:00,001
Must meet you on evening.
Around 8 o'clock.

358
00:43:05,335 --> 00:43:12,335
That night we had met here.
We were sitting over there.

359
00:43:17,751 --> 00:43:20,376
DGP spoke in an irritated tone.

360
00:43:21,085 --> 00:43:24,335
There is no effort from the side of
the team that is what he says.

361
00:43:24,376 --> 00:43:26,376
Then tell him, to
do the investigation.

362
00:43:26,585 --> 00:43:29,834
No need to blame him,
what can he do?

363
00:43:29,835 --> 00:43:32,135
When there is pressure
from the ministry level.

364
00:43:32,137 --> 00:43:34,562
Aryans, family had also complained,
that there is no developments...

365
00:43:34,564 --> 00:43:36,522
since a week has passed.

366
00:43:37,335 --> 00:43:39,085
They are going in for a press meet.

367
00:43:39,335 --> 00:43:43,001
We have reached three solid
suspects. Captain Sreenivas,

368
00:43:43,210 --> 00:43:46,501
Roy then that sketch. Did no one
notice, those developments?

369
00:43:48,501 --> 00:43:51,210
These three, are connected
somewhere and somehow.

370
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:54,843
I'm only asking few more time,
to find out that connection.

371
00:43:56,445 --> 00:43:59,728
As far as I'm concerned, the
deceased, is not just like anyone...

372
00:43:59,739 --> 00:44:01,139
to drain out the enthusiasm.

373
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:08,126
You'll not keep your heads down,
before anyone. That's my word.

374
00:44:13,335 --> 00:44:17,917
After we left from there,
almost after forty five minutes...

375
00:44:17,918 --> 00:44:19,068
then came a phone call.

376
00:44:25,543 --> 00:44:26,835
I found the culprit!

377
00:44:27,668 --> 00:44:33,001
That means at the time
of accident, I knew it.

378
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:08,168
That means at the time
of accident, I knew it.

379
00:45:12,085 --> 00:45:18,625
To be very precise, from the moment
we parted to the time of the accident.

380
00:45:18,626 --> 00:45:21,301
Within that gap, you
found out, who is the culprit.

381
00:45:22,876 --> 00:45:25,843
The case dairy, that was half
finished by Antony Moses...

382
00:45:26,126 --> 00:45:28,043
must be closed by Antony Moses.

383
00:45:29,918 --> 00:45:35,501
I don't know the people, who I
had mentioned in that case dairy.

384
00:45:36,001 --> 00:45:37,918
I don't know the places.

385
00:45:39,085 --> 00:45:40,585
I don't know myself.

386
00:45:43,085 --> 00:45:44,543
I'm...

387
00:45:47,376 --> 00:45:52,501
There are no individuals in a case
dairy, witnesses, evidences...

388
00:45:52,710 --> 00:45:55,418
suspects, no need to know,
anyone more than that.

389
00:45:56,201 --> 00:46:03,168
To find out a case, it is the instruments, the individuals...
their statements and places.

390
00:46:06,751 --> 00:46:10,085
What is lost is only a
memory, not the ability to think.

391
00:46:14,251 --> 00:46:17,001
That is more important
to strive on in this case.

392
00:46:18,668 --> 00:46:21,876
You can again reach where
you have reached before.

393
00:46:22,293 --> 00:46:25,626
During the time of the accident.
There was a suggestion.

394
00:46:25,693 --> 00:46:28,801
That investigation must be carried
out by some other officer...

395
00:46:28,851 --> 00:46:32,435
I denied that, because
I had the confidence.

396
00:46:33,210 --> 00:46:35,917
Or in other words, the
confidence in you, that I have,

397
00:46:35,918 --> 00:46:38,418
- do not have with any other officer.

398
00:46:40,085 --> 00:46:43,784
But in my present condition, to get
the permission from higher officials!

399
00:46:45,185 --> 00:46:48,250
As I told you, nobody knows
any detail, about anything...

400
00:46:48,251 --> 00:46:49,710
except more than an accident.

401
00:46:50,251 --> 00:46:53,126
Except you, me and the Doctor.

402
00:46:53,751 --> 00:46:58,001
For this reason, I
maintained a secrecy on it.

403
00:47:02,335 --> 00:47:05,960
You are fit to continue
this case, my certificate.

404
00:47:06,126 --> 00:47:09,251
I'm also your higher official.

405
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:23,460
Antony Moses had
taken bigger risks that this.

406
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:29,085
I'm only about to face
everyone and everything.

407
00:47:30,126 --> 00:47:33,835
I do not know whether I'm prepared
to face, the life of a police officer.

408
00:47:37,835 --> 00:47:41,751
I must meet the Doctor
who treated me.

409
00:47:47,168 --> 00:47:50,251
The men and incidents which
the 'A' knows, 'B' doesn't know.

410
00:47:50,418 --> 00:47:52,001
No personal details.

411
00:47:52,585 --> 00:47:56,692
In a way, two are entirely
different men, in character...

412
00:47:56,693 --> 00:47:58,242
attitude and preferences.

413
00:47:58,243 --> 00:48:01,084
But whatever 'A' knows,
like the languages learned...

414
00:48:01,085 --> 00:48:03,185
skills everything will be
remembered by 'B'

415
00:48:03,876 --> 00:48:09,251
Like driving, swimming, the
games you are familiar with...

416
00:48:09,418 --> 00:48:11,835
training you have got.

417
00:48:12,085 --> 00:48:13,735
There will be no problem on this.

418
00:48:34,126 --> 00:48:36,751
Apple computers heard of it is it not?

419
00:48:39,418 --> 00:48:42,959
Steve Wozniak one of the founders.

420
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:46,584
He lost the memory in a plane crash.

421
00:48:46,585 --> 00:48:49,335
He got it back, within
five weeks' time.

422
00:48:53,085 --> 00:48:57,751
May be next year, may
be next month or next day.

423
00:49:01,918 --> 00:49:06,584
Do we have examples of
those who never recovered?

424
00:49:06,585 --> 00:49:08,668
That is also there but less in number.

425
00:49:09,126 --> 00:49:12,043
But come on, why do want
to think in a negative way?

426
00:49:14,793 --> 00:49:16,293
Will I be able to do my work?

427
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:19,043
I mean, the decisions I take...

428
00:49:19,210 --> 00:49:22,543
my conclusions will it
be laureate enough?

429
00:51:20,251 --> 00:51:22,335
Sir do not create troubles.

430
00:51:25,085 --> 00:51:26,735
I have not come to make troubles.

431
00:51:28,835 --> 00:51:30,435
There are twelve men around you.

432
00:51:30,835 --> 00:51:32,668
Everyone is well armed!

433
00:51:45,418 --> 00:51:49,085
Without this, I cannot straight
way come and talk to you.

434
00:51:51,835 --> 00:51:54,751
Other day I came to the flat,
to chop off your hands.

435
00:51:55,251 --> 00:51:58,551
As a male, at least he must do that,
to a guy, who caught his wife.

436
00:52:03,751 --> 00:52:07,352
On that day, it didn't work out that is
why I'm now here in front of you.

437
00:52:07,376 --> 00:52:10,876
Sir, I know, or else,
you will ruin my family.

438
00:52:11,418 --> 00:52:14,960
Sir, you are the only person
responsible for my present state.

439
00:52:15,126 --> 00:52:19,043
I was living in a decent
way, by driving taxi.

440
00:52:19,210 --> 00:52:22,751
On the death of that police
officer, I do not have any role.

441
00:52:23,251 --> 00:52:27,251
If I had, I would have accepted it
I don't have any kind of fear.

442
00:52:28,210 --> 00:52:30,460
Don't try to trap me in that.

443
00:52:30,918 --> 00:52:34,835
Leaving away everything, I'm
going to live for my family again.

444
00:52:35,418 --> 00:52:37,543
Again don't come to harass me.

445
00:52:40,501 --> 00:52:42,418
It is not this Roy alone.

446
00:52:42,585 --> 00:52:47,543
Don't you have the curse of many?
Which is more than enough!

447
00:52:56,168 --> 00:53:00,626
Farhan, I'm again taking the
charge. From tomorrow onwards.

448
00:54:01,585 --> 00:54:03,710
There are two
incidents to be happy,

449
00:54:03,918 --> 00:54:07,709
one, you have joined
and Ammu's result had come.

450
00:54:07,710 --> 00:54:11,110
Even though it is a second chance,
she had passed with a first class.

451
00:54:14,112 --> 00:54:16,294
I know though you had
not given as a debt...

452
00:54:16,296 --> 00:54:20,046
again I've to come to
you, in future also.

453
00:54:24,543 --> 00:54:31,543
She is interested in a MBA, I cannot
afford it, but let her study is it not sir?

454
00:55:21,043 --> 00:55:24,293
When I came here, happened
to know, you had joined.

455
00:55:47,835 --> 00:55:51,376
Daughter's marriage,
Sunday after next week.

456
00:55:59,126 --> 00:55:59,876
I'll come.

457
00:56:07,251 --> 00:56:08,335
Shall I go?

458
00:56:42,251 --> 00:56:43,460
He had called me...

459
00:56:43,793 --> 00:56:46,617
he inquired, whether, you
had completely recovered?

460
00:56:46,619 --> 00:56:49,852
I guessed it rightly, something of
this sort might have happened.

461
00:56:49,854 --> 00:56:54,021
That is next step. Knowing
who is who and what is what.

462
00:57:18,001 --> 00:57:22,543
All of higher caste, salute
them, wherever you see them!

463
00:57:23,293 --> 00:57:28,168
If you don't do that, there are
incidents where, one will be put to traffic.

464
00:57:32,418 --> 00:57:36,335
Is it like this? Seems like,
I had not forgotten that.

465
00:58:09,835 --> 00:58:12,750
Knew, you took the charge,
but couldn't meet you...

466
00:58:12,751 --> 00:58:15,101
as it was combing right
from morning, C.l James.

467
00:58:17,918 --> 00:58:19,667
Will it be over soon?

468
00:58:19,668 --> 00:58:21,768
Since it is Saturday,
will go on till dawn.

469
00:58:22,543 --> 00:58:24,251
If I could just sleep.

470
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:26,551
Sir, you can sit in the car, if required.

471
00:58:26,585 --> 00:58:28,185
Can't you understand on telling?

472
00:58:32,418 --> 00:58:33,793
Johnny leave it man!

473
00:58:51,876 --> 00:58:54,460
Whoever it may be, do as told.

474
00:58:54,626 --> 00:59:00,960
We'll be having lot of
meeting with lot of dignitaries...

475
00:59:01,585 --> 00:59:02,985
Sometimes we may drink also.

476
00:59:03,318 --> 00:59:06,168
If you have any complaints, go
to naval base and complain.

477
00:59:06,170 --> 00:59:08,237
Don't play this drama,
on the road, on us.

478
00:59:08,285 --> 00:59:10,851
We will see that during the
high way rule comes.

479
00:59:10,918 --> 00:59:14,335
For the time being it is under the
Matancherry police jurisdiction.

480
00:59:14,543 --> 00:59:16,143
We take the complaint from here.

481
00:59:20,376 --> 00:59:21,426
What will you do?

482
00:59:34,451 --> 00:59:36,543
Take him for medical
and prepare a FIR!

483
00:59:36,626 --> 00:59:39,543
I'll not spare you! I'll show you.

484
00:59:41,293 --> 00:59:42,676
Move back!

485
00:59:55,578 --> 00:59:57,486
These guys will make
a mess out of it.

486
00:59:57,488 --> 00:59:58,820
I was about to say that.

487
00:59:58,822 --> 01:00:01,421
What trouble? Charge them
with, duty obstruction also.

488
01:00:01,423 --> 01:00:04,289
Not that sir, sometimes, young
cadres from navy will land up here.

489
01:00:04,292 --> 01:00:06,542
The other guy had gone for that.

490
01:00:10,668 --> 01:00:13,667
Aryan must have handled the
situation in a tactful manner.

491
01:00:13,668 --> 01:00:15,469
On the same day,
you took the charge.

492
01:00:16,251 --> 01:00:17,835
I will do something.

493
01:00:18,376 --> 01:00:19,576
Give the phone to James.

494
01:00:22,835 --> 01:00:25,250
It seems they will
react to it, is it not?

495
01:00:25,251 --> 01:00:27,585
From the nature of their behavior.

496
01:00:28,626 --> 01:00:32,126
All of you must stay there, at any
cost, no one should leave the place.

497
01:00:43,751 --> 01:00:45,001
Antony it is me.

498
01:01:13,335 --> 01:01:14,501
Who are they?

499
01:01:15,251 --> 01:01:17,960
They are the loading
and unloading men at harbor...

500
01:01:18,126 --> 01:01:20,960
not sure, with how
many men, will come.

501
01:01:23,543 --> 01:01:26,626
Do you need paid men, to
scuff them back? You rascal!

502
01:01:26,835 --> 01:01:30,168
Go for some other job, by
giving this to some young lads!

503
01:01:38,460 --> 01:01:41,918
Clear off everyone, no one
should be seen here!

504
01:01:49,335 --> 01:01:51,293
The gate must be open!

505
01:02:09,835 --> 01:02:11,386
They might be coming for you...

506
01:02:11,543 --> 01:02:15,001
but at any cost do not come
out, whatever happens!

507
01:02:17,251 --> 01:02:19,460
Do you have gun?
In case of an emergency.

508
01:02:20,085 --> 01:02:25,043
Don't hesitate, if there is no other
way, use it, which is for it is given.

509
01:02:26,001 --> 01:02:29,043
Others life is not more
important than ones safety.

510
01:02:31,126 --> 01:02:33,076
Must need one more
person, come with me.

511
01:03:41,251 --> 01:03:44,210
On their way, they
stoned at the street lights.

512
01:03:44,460 --> 01:03:47,668
Their intention was to
attack, by making dark.

513
01:03:48,001 --> 01:03:51,960
Nobody has been charged so far,
were waiting for you to come.

514
01:03:58,418 --> 01:04:01,876
That Captains medical is also
over, the percentage of alcohol...

515
01:04:02,043 --> 01:04:03,594
in the blood is more than 30mg.

516
01:04:04,126 --> 01:04:06,585
So far that is not on the records!

517
01:04:18,293 --> 01:04:20,376
I was there in Bombay,
Q1 branch.

518
01:04:20,668 --> 01:04:22,335
Myself and Farhan for two years.

519
01:04:23,085 --> 01:04:29,710
I was in Bandra. For some
time I was in Q1 branch.

520
01:04:29,918 --> 01:04:33,043
But came back, could
not confront with terrorist.

521
01:04:37,043 --> 01:04:39,535
So it will turn out to be
a problem, is it not?

522
01:04:39,537 --> 01:04:45,204
Nothing like that, it will be over now.
That is why he had come directly.

523
01:04:50,751 --> 01:04:54,501
Night is young, coming for a drink!

524
01:04:59,126 --> 01:05:01,926
Anyway on the first day
itself it was a great experience.

525
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:05,751
Is it a big deal for a person
seasoned in Bombay?

526
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:09,834
Why did you opt for Bombay, as the
Father and Brother is staying here?

527
01:05:09,835 --> 01:05:14,126
Father insisted more on it, for high
level contacts, it seems to be good.

528
01:05:15,751 --> 01:05:18,210
From now on. Our own Cochin.

529
01:05:24,585 --> 01:05:28,460
That remind me, on
a return flight from there.

530
01:05:28,793 --> 01:05:31,043
There was a Neerupama Tabuk.

531
01:05:32,085 --> 01:05:34,793
She is very famous among
the social circles here.

532
01:05:35,001 --> 01:05:37,418
I know. That Delhi lady, is it not?

533
01:05:37,585 --> 01:05:41,585
Jewelry designer, well known
face on high-heeled parties.

534
01:05:44,710 --> 01:05:49,085
It is said that most wanted
for males, the moment I saw her,

535
01:05:49,251 --> 01:05:51,793
- had booked a room at Taj.

536
01:05:52,418 --> 01:05:54,125
Only two hours in the flight,

537
01:05:54,126 --> 01:05:59,335
I didn't ask, but she asked me,
like to have dinner with me.

538
01:06:01,585 --> 01:06:02,418
Then what?

539
01:06:05,085 --> 01:06:05,918
Then?

540
01:06:06,085 --> 01:06:09,334
Full stop over there. I came,
saying no and thank you.

541
01:06:09,335 --> 01:06:14,709
That may not be true. Hard to
believe that you are a saint like that.

542
01:06:14,710 --> 01:06:18,501
Sir, I was not even a
saint but a number one devil.

543
01:06:18,918 --> 01:06:20,918
But for the last one and a half year.

544
01:06:21,085 --> 01:06:25,668
The moment, I think about, such
acts, a feeling of guilt overrides me.

545
01:06:25,835 --> 01:06:29,168
So, at the most ten minutes flirting
that too out of an emergency.

546
01:06:29,418 --> 01:06:32,501
After all ethics is more
important to us, is it not?

547
01:06:35,168 --> 01:06:37,126
What is the name of the ethics?

548
01:06:39,626 --> 01:06:40,460
Rebecca.

549
01:06:43,460 --> 01:06:45,835
When, where and how?

550
01:06:46,168 --> 01:06:50,876
St. Xaviers college chairman comes
to invite newly joined IPS officer.

551
01:06:51,043 --> 01:06:52,710
- For union day inauguration.

552
01:06:55,251 --> 01:06:57,668
Is it a long distance love?

553
01:06:59,501 --> 01:07:01,710
Campus selection, Wipro, Cochin.

554
01:07:22,751 --> 01:07:24,043
Come, just pop in and go.

555
01:07:24,210 --> 01:07:26,375
Already late now, some other time.

556
01:07:26,376 --> 01:07:29,876
Since you had come all this way,
just come and meet Father and Brother.

557
01:07:33,835 --> 01:07:38,335
Shift the hall placement to this side,
so that there is more privacy.

558
01:07:45,210 --> 01:07:46,043
Father, this is.

559
01:07:57,585 --> 01:07:58,793
Aryan come on,

560
01:07:59,585 --> 01:08:02,459
- you can be disturbed
thinking about any other thing,

561
01:08:02,460 --> 01:08:04,501
but not, on how I felt.

562
01:08:04,876 --> 01:08:07,526
I forgot about that, moment
I came out from that room.

563
01:08:12,043 --> 01:08:13,543
I know, you can't accept that.

564
01:08:14,418 --> 01:08:17,251
You were more insulted
than me, I know that.

565
01:08:17,626 --> 01:08:21,168
On similar incidents like this, and
if you think like having a drink.

566
01:08:21,335 --> 01:08:25,001
You have 1,800 square
feet flat at your service.

567
01:08:37,835 --> 01:08:41,168
I will bring him to my alley,
whenever I'm conscious.

568
01:08:42,043 --> 01:08:45,085
For 30 years I couldn't do that!

569
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:50,335
Thanks that you
made the door open,

570
01:08:51,126 --> 01:08:53,501
- can expect more
of this nuisance,

571
01:08:53,668 --> 01:08:55,085
Frequency from now on.

572
01:08:56,043 --> 01:08:58,668
Tomorrow are we
rocking at sir's house, is it not?

573
01:10:09,085 --> 01:10:16,085
We had just started here. Seems
like, will be bit late, no, usual quota.

574
01:10:19,085 --> 01:10:20,460
He is here with me.

575
01:10:21,918 --> 01:10:22,501
Who?

576
01:10:22,668 --> 01:10:23,251
Any.

577
01:10:26,043 --> 01:10:29,351
Either you throw that phone.
Or call once in a while.

578
01:10:29,418 --> 01:10:32,092
I was busy, running around.
Will be there by Sunday,

579
01:10:32,093 --> 01:10:33,250
will that be enough?

580
01:10:33,251 --> 01:10:36,318
Thursday, it is Father's anniversary,
will you come to church?

581
01:10:36,385 --> 01:10:39,584
I got some other job, if there is
no job also, I won't come.

582
01:10:39,585 --> 01:10:43,084
Since he is dead, had he
become great, did he?

583
01:10:43,085 --> 01:10:44,835
No more debate on this issue.

584
01:10:45,126 --> 01:10:46,126
Will meet on Sunday.

585
01:10:55,543 --> 01:10:57,543
When he was alive, never cared,

586
01:10:58,251 --> 01:11:00,751
- still she has got
sympathy toward him.

587
01:11:05,001 --> 01:11:08,835
Ten to fifteen years I was struggling
alone, along with her, in my hand.

588
01:11:11,043 --> 01:11:16,335
Mine and her life was balanced,
ever since you came in our life.

589
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:25,418
Finished so soon, I
thought you will go, with her.

590
01:11:34,418 --> 01:11:35,251
What is this?

591
01:11:51,501 --> 01:11:52,501
Antony, no need!

592
01:12:07,085 --> 01:12:10,126
Six stitches, two days
he will be in the hospital.

593
01:12:10,293 --> 01:12:13,001
Good thing, let his
head get cool by the time!

594
01:12:13,585 --> 01:12:17,543
Because of that confusion,
could not figure out, who bet him.

595
01:12:18,001 --> 01:12:20,250
But once they get a strong witness,

596
01:12:20,251 --> 01:12:23,710
- case will be different and also
these people are on full swing.

597
01:12:27,835 --> 01:12:29,085
Mumbai police?

598
01:12:29,251 --> 01:12:34,835
A new name for three
of us. Congratulations!

599
01:12:35,335 --> 01:12:37,251
How did they come to know this?

600
01:12:38,043 --> 01:12:42,375
Apart from family and friends,
then there was only three of us.

601
01:12:42,376 --> 01:12:44,126
There was also a show off by Aryan.

602
01:12:44,460 --> 01:12:48,376
No need of a sixth
sense, to guess you or him.

603
01:12:49,043 --> 01:12:50,293
I was trapped in between.

604
01:12:59,085 --> 01:13:00,501
Feeling proud of yourself?

605
01:13:01,543 --> 01:13:06,143
I have a request, to both of
you, on my responsibility,

606
01:13:06,251 --> 01:13:08,250
- both are being send to Hyderabad.

607
01:13:08,251 --> 01:13:10,668
Don't tarnish my name,
within week of your stay.

608
01:13:11,210 --> 01:13:14,311
Because both have the capacity
for it, that is why I'm telling.

609
01:13:15,168 --> 01:13:19,293
Anyway, it's a great misfortune,
coaching IPS students...

610
01:13:19,501 --> 01:13:21,210
is it that important?

611
01:13:22,043 --> 01:13:27,792
You go on talking in this
fashion, it is out of your luck,

612
01:13:27,793 --> 01:13:29,594
and they opted for
such a suggestion.

613
01:13:30,060 --> 01:13:32,625
On by-passing those
officers whom they suggested,

614
01:13:32,626 --> 01:13:33,776
- I'm leaving you both.

615
01:13:34,126 --> 01:13:38,168
If you stay here, you both
will be white washed by media.

616
01:13:39,626 --> 01:13:42,176
You blame me, I'm trying
to cool down the issues...

617
01:13:42,178 --> 01:13:44,886
by sending you two, elsewhere.

618
01:13:46,085 --> 01:13:48,043
I'm not thinking that.

619
01:13:48,251 --> 01:13:49,001
What?

620
01:13:49,543 --> 01:13:52,210
What will be happening inside that?

621
01:13:53,585 --> 01:13:56,036
When you were in Bombay,
it was parting and booze,

622
01:13:56,293 --> 01:13:58,994
it was better than this.
Much better than a new friend.

623
01:13:59,085 --> 01:14:01,043
Do you know his reputation?

624
01:14:01,210 --> 01:14:04,610
People frown, on hearing his name,
if you want you check by yourself.

625
01:14:05,001 --> 01:14:09,168
Anyway, he is a friend, who is not
eager, that he must be proud of me.

626
01:14:09,743 --> 01:14:12,792
This is the after effect that
an IPS degree was added...

627
01:14:12,793 --> 01:14:14,793
which was never in my ambition list.

628
01:14:15,251 --> 01:14:17,918
Just think like that, this
disgrace, because of me.

629
01:14:18,501 --> 01:14:19,168
Sunny.

630
01:14:19,335 --> 01:14:20,735
Over take that car and stop.

631
01:14:30,626 --> 01:14:32,960
What are you doing Aryan?

632
01:14:50,626 --> 01:14:51,335
Will go!

633
01:15:12,085 --> 01:15:13,251
Take care of him.

634
01:15:17,251 --> 01:15:18,843
Right person, to hand over.

635
01:15:28,035 --> 01:15:31,101
But three of us never expected
that journey will change...

636
01:15:31,168 --> 01:15:34,001
the phase of our life, forever.

637
01:15:58,585 --> 01:16:03,250
Three Maoist men, kidnapped the
participants for National games...

638
01:16:03,251 --> 01:16:04,543
held at Hyderabad.

639
01:16:04,710 --> 01:16:10,250
They have demanded, seven men
jailed at Thihar, must be released...

640
01:16:10,251 --> 01:16:14,375
- in exchange for athletics.

641
01:16:14,376 --> 01:16:16,125
The incident
happened an hour back.

642
01:16:16,126 --> 01:16:18,293
They have started harming us.

643
01:16:19,001 --> 01:16:21,843
When we asked for water,
we were beaten with the rifle.

644
01:16:24,126 --> 01:16:26,750
In the confrontation
between the Maoist groups...

645
01:16:26,751 --> 01:16:28,542
and Hyderabad commando force.

646
01:16:28,543 --> 01:16:32,384
Aryan John and Antony Moses,
from Kerala police force...

647
01:16:32,385 --> 01:16:34,051
were also part of the operation.

648
01:16:34,060 --> 01:16:37,243
Three terrorist were
gunned down by Mattancherry...

649
01:16:37,251 --> 01:16:39,391
assistant Commissioner
Aryan John Jacob.

650
01:16:39,394 --> 01:16:44,159
For further discussion on this, IG Gopinathan
Nair, is here... with us on the telephone line.

651
01:16:44,162 --> 01:16:46,194
How would you
evaluate the situation?

652
01:16:46,196 --> 01:16:51,696
We must be all proud of State police force, more over
officer's like Aryan John Jacob, will enhance the law...

653
01:16:51,793 --> 01:16:54,168
and order system and the
confidence of police...

654
01:16:54,335 --> 01:16:55,375
among the public.

655
01:16:55,376 --> 01:16:57,376
Even though, I'm a senior officer,

656
01:16:57,543 --> 01:17:00,001
I'm offering, him a big
salute to what he did.

657
01:17:03,418 --> 01:17:06,268
We requested to them that we
must assist in the encounter.

658
01:17:07,501 --> 01:17:10,576
They welcomed it, as we were in
the Que1 branch for some time.

659
01:17:10,810 --> 01:17:13,625
The other commandos who
participated, in the operation...

660
01:17:13,626 --> 01:17:15,592
had all praised on
your shooting skill.

661
01:17:15,593 --> 01:17:17,885
Are you still continuing
the practice on that?

662
01:17:17,951 --> 01:17:22,435
Every day without fail, I'm
practicing on firing range.

663
01:17:22,501 --> 01:17:26,460
How do you feel now, with in a day
you are a national hero now?

664
01:17:28,085 --> 01:17:31,710
I'm pleased, this achievement,
I'm dedicating to my Father.

665
01:17:31,918 --> 01:17:34,501
What is it or who is
this Mumbai police?

666
01:17:37,793 --> 01:17:41,043
For that word, you journalist
had already glorified it a lot,

667
01:17:41,251 --> 01:17:45,585
- three police men's
hoodlum, irreverence and all.

668
01:17:46,210 --> 01:17:49,710
But I have only one
definition to give, for that word.

669
01:17:53,001 --> 01:17:54,001
'Friendship'

670
01:17:55,051 --> 01:17:58,635
Total area was about, one acres of
land, with a five stored building.

671
01:17:58,685 --> 01:18:02,735
We were 12 men, with a well
maintained secrecy plan.

672
01:18:02,826 --> 01:18:05,268
The entire group was
split to two men in a group.

673
01:18:05,335 --> 01:18:08,385
We surrounded the entire building.
I and he were in one group.

674
01:18:08,501 --> 01:18:11,668
They started firing, the moment
we surrounded the building...

675
01:18:11,835 --> 01:18:12,936
from the fourth floor.

676
01:18:13,418 --> 01:18:15,001
Without taking the stair case,

677
01:18:16,085 --> 01:18:19,501
- we went in this way,
look, reached fourth floor.

678
01:18:21,626 --> 01:18:25,251
They started shooting from the
middle room at the corridor.

679
01:18:25,460 --> 01:18:28,626
We understood athletics were
inside the just opposite room.

680
01:18:28,793 --> 01:18:33,710
But to open that we must cross their
room. There was only one way out.

681
01:18:33,876 --> 01:18:35,350
We must bring them out.

682
01:18:35,351 --> 01:18:38,801
On that adverse situation, threw
the tear gas shell in to the room.

683
01:18:38,804 --> 01:18:42,054
As the three men came out, at that
moment itself, three were shot.

684
01:18:46,418 --> 01:18:47,335
Who?

685
01:18:49,751 --> 01:18:52,918
Why did you ask like that, haven't
you see on TV and newspaper?

686
01:18:53,460 --> 01:18:55,011
That, compatriots will believe!

687
01:19:07,001 --> 01:19:10,084
I also fired, but it didn't
go where it was expected.

688
01:19:10,085 --> 01:19:11,636
Then how come a news like that?

689
01:19:13,418 --> 01:19:17,092
As I told, I had also done firing,
as the other officers came...

690
01:19:17,093 --> 01:19:20,543
I was standing there. They miss-
understood, I was the one who fired.

691
01:19:20,593 --> 01:19:23,785
He didn't change it and he never
allowed me speak about it also.

692
01:19:23,788 --> 01:19:25,608
Then came the media men.

693
01:19:25,612 --> 01:19:30,362
He and others told my name.
By the time, I couldn't do anything on that.

694
01:19:31,335 --> 01:19:32,985
What a stupidity you had done?

695
01:19:34,710 --> 01:19:36,367
I also told him the same thing,

696
01:19:36,369 --> 01:19:38,711
- on that night, press
meet I was ready to say,

697
01:19:38,713 --> 01:19:41,121
- what had actually happened.
He didn't allow me.

698
01:19:41,123 --> 01:19:44,748
Don't you know the seriousness of
that? If at all any inquiry come?

699
01:19:45,168 --> 01:19:47,951
What inquiry? That
chapter is closed there itself.

700
01:19:48,043 --> 01:19:51,101
It was a great disgust for me,
on taking the credit on action,

701
01:19:51,168 --> 01:19:52,335
- which I haven't done.

702
01:19:53,668 --> 01:19:57,250
To tell the truth, to certain extend,

703
01:19:57,251 --> 01:19:59,702
- it was reduced, on seeing
my Father's happiness.

704
01:20:01,001 --> 01:20:04,084
On whatever account,
it may be, for the first time...

705
01:20:04,085 --> 01:20:05,685
my Father spoke
quite high of me.

706
01:20:06,918 --> 01:20:09,918
Now at least I have a feeling that
I'm going to my own house.

707
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,692
For me, what is the use of it?

708
01:20:21,695 --> 01:20:23,631
For whom to show?

709
01:20:23,634 --> 01:20:26,922
He needs it more than me, let him take it.

710
01:20:28,085 --> 01:20:31,876
Can police officers act in ad films?

711
01:20:32,043 --> 01:20:32,585
Why?

712
01:20:32,751 --> 01:20:33,960
I got an offer.

713
01:20:44,335 --> 01:20:48,960
'Remember saving electricity
is like, saving the country'

714
01:20:50,626 --> 01:20:53,376
On 17th onwards it will be
aired on channels, how is it?

715
01:20:54,043 --> 01:20:56,984
I'm planning to change my
relationship status to single...

716
01:20:56,985 --> 01:20:58,568
on 'Face Book'

717
01:21:01,335 --> 01:21:03,136
Papa and Mummy
they are all thrilled.

718
01:21:07,085 --> 01:21:14,085
Only Papa and Mummy got thrilled?
I took all this risk only to impress you.

719
01:21:14,668 --> 01:21:18,959
I know, it was a great desire
I had to marry an officer...

720
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:20,560
who had killed three terrorists.

721
01:21:28,751 --> 01:21:29,793
Homemade is there.

722
01:21:30,001 --> 01:21:30,501
No need.

723
01:21:32,085 --> 01:21:34,935
Is it that you don't drink or
is it you don't want it now?

724
01:21:34,960 --> 01:21:40,376
No I don't take. Whatever Mumbai
we may say, Trissur is still there.

725
01:21:43,376 --> 01:21:46,835
Don't you know, the calmest
minded police officer of Kerala!

726
01:21:48,293 --> 01:21:49,001
And this one.

727
01:21:49,418 --> 01:21:50,085
Ethics!

728
01:21:51,085 --> 01:21:51,626
What?

729
01:21:52,418 --> 01:21:55,668
He said, when we...
One second, sit.

730
01:21:55,835 --> 01:21:56,635
Let me tell man!

731
01:22:00,085 --> 01:22:01,293
Which you want first.

732
01:22:07,376 --> 01:22:11,835
Antony... Transferred to
Gujarat cadre, as DCP,

733
01:22:12,710 --> 01:22:14,751
- must take charge
within two months.

734
01:22:27,960 --> 01:22:30,168
Even otherwise, one
cannot stay here always.

735
01:22:30,235 --> 01:22:32,610
What difference does
it make if it is any hell?

736
01:22:32,626 --> 01:22:36,026
But will not get rascals like you as
friends. That is the only thing!

737
01:22:38,085 --> 01:22:39,335
Can we influence someone?

738
01:22:39,501 --> 01:22:43,251
Leave it man! I don't want to
stay here, by begging anyone.

739
01:22:47,210 --> 01:22:50,917
Gallantry award for 2012, for
bravery, request mister...

740
01:22:50,918 --> 01:22:56,168
Aryan John Jacob, to the dais
to receive from the governor.

741
01:23:05,251 --> 01:23:07,542
I was never a good police officer...

742
01:23:07,543 --> 01:23:11,959
and I don't know how a
good police officer should be.

743
01:23:11,960 --> 01:23:17,251
I was often, astonished, on thinking
how an IPS label came to me.

744
01:23:17,418 --> 01:23:18,625
However, it may be...

745
01:23:18,626 --> 01:23:22,042
- everywhere I go it is never
more than a premium status symbol.

746
01:23:22,043 --> 01:23:25,984
Nothing more than this, I had not shown
any undue respect... to this position.

747
01:23:25,986 --> 01:23:30,069
I know myself, for a below
average, officer like me, this is...

748
01:23:46,785 --> 01:23:50,001
There is no procedure, like
delegating an investigation to an...

749
01:23:50,010 --> 01:23:52,385
officer, who is about
to get transferred.

750
01:23:53,668 --> 01:23:58,043
By ignoring all the obstacles from
all sides, and assigning to you.

751
01:23:59,001 --> 01:24:03,585
I was pretty sure and
I was never wrong in that.

752
01:24:04,418 --> 01:24:05,210
But...

753
01:24:11,251 --> 01:24:15,085
A police officer must be
never emotionally attached, on job.

754
01:24:15,335 --> 01:24:18,501
But within 14 years
of my experience...

755
01:24:18,751 --> 01:24:22,251
I was never attached to
any other case like this.

756
01:24:23,126 --> 01:24:25,960
There is no other case
which had haunted me like this.

757
01:24:27,210 --> 01:24:30,126
You must find the
answer for that once again.

758
01:24:31,085 --> 01:24:37,835
Before that accident, you must
reach it to the vital clue once again.

759
01:24:39,751 --> 01:24:46,335
For me, for you, for him.

760
01:24:49,793 --> 01:24:54,460
On the 18th day, I want
the finished case file on my table.

761
01:24:54,835 --> 01:24:57,168
It must have the
answers for three questions.

762
01:24:59,585 --> 01:25:02,335
How? Why? And who?

763
01:25:24,668 --> 01:25:26,668
How? Why? And who?

764
01:25:28,585 --> 01:25:31,793
A complete case file with all the
answers. There are my findings.

765
01:25:32,085 --> 01:25:38,001
Through those findings I
had reached conclusions.

766
01:25:39,751 --> 01:25:43,151
This is my dairy with my personal
finding for the last eighteen days.

767
01:25:44,626 --> 01:25:49,376
You must read both, at times
you must read both intermingled.

768
01:25:50,835 --> 01:25:55,001
By all sense, there is one and
only blank page, of the case file...

769
01:25:55,210 --> 01:25:59,460
Very last page, you must fill it.

770
01:26:06,460 --> 01:26:07,835
Only you can do it!

771
01:26:32,793 --> 01:26:36,643
Within seventeen days if we do
not prove this, some other officer,

772
01:26:36,710 --> 01:26:39,168
- other than me, will take
the charge of the case.

773
01:26:39,251 --> 01:26:42,551
Perhaps, sometimes some other
team will assist him, other than you.

774
01:26:42,553 --> 01:26:46,076
- I have a desire that it must not happen like that.
- We too.

775
01:26:47,100 --> 01:26:51,826
As Rakhi, madam told us we had interrogated Captain
Sreenivas... and Roy in a detailed manner.

776
01:26:53,051 --> 01:26:55,268
But nothing turned out
in a helpful manner.

777
01:26:55,335 --> 01:26:58,625
Captain Sreenivas was very much
there in naval base on the day...

778
01:26:58,626 --> 01:27:00,584
of the crime and the day before.

779
01:27:00,585 --> 01:27:03,417
We must confirm
about Roy once again.

780
01:27:03,418 --> 01:27:07,601
He was released on the condition that he must report...
...whenever he is asked to.

781
01:27:07,603 --> 01:27:10,520
Some of our informers
are also watching him.

782
01:27:16,751 --> 01:27:20,292
Maoist group had
denied the claim of the murder.

783
01:27:20,293 --> 01:27:25,584
From their past history, they will
accept, if at all they had any role in it.

784
01:27:25,585 --> 01:27:28,376
Especially, if it is a violence
on account of vengeance.

785
01:27:29,376 --> 01:27:32,960
These are the photos of sharp
shooters that we got within ten days.

786
01:27:33,126 --> 01:27:38,143
There are similarities with the sketch
we had given, this is from all metros.

787
01:27:44,401 --> 01:27:46,709
I need one sharp
shooter for one day...

788
01:27:46,710 --> 01:27:48,751
who is detained in police custody.

789
01:27:49,085 --> 01:27:51,251
Just to find out their way of working.

790
01:28:00,126 --> 01:28:03,334
Just before restarting,
just wanted to meet everyone.

791
01:28:03,335 --> 01:28:06,036
From tomorrow onwards we
will have a detailed sessions.

792
01:28:19,001 --> 01:28:22,001
It is over, just for five minutes.

793
01:28:28,126 --> 01:28:32,710
There is only one confusion, no
problem with Sudhakaran...

794
01:28:33,293 --> 01:28:39,335
But rest of three, I'm tensed on,
how I used to interact with them?

795
01:28:39,668 --> 01:28:43,710
No idea, how I dealt with everyone.

796
01:28:44,335 --> 01:28:47,668
No I don't think anybody
had a doubt like that.

797
01:28:50,043 --> 01:28:51,093
I'll do the updating.

798
01:28:59,960 --> 01:29:00,668
What is it?

799
01:29:00,835 --> 01:29:02,750
When you were in hospital...

800
01:29:02,751 --> 01:29:05,301
that Roy's wife had given
a complaint against you...

801
01:29:05,335 --> 01:29:07,335
Showing that you
misbehaved with her.

802
01:29:07,543 --> 01:29:10,644
Anyhow, I had talked with her and
the complaint was taken back.

803
01:29:11,418 --> 01:29:13,476
I did that, because it
must not create...

804
01:29:13,543 --> 01:29:15,451
a bad mark for the
investigation team.

805
01:29:15,455 --> 01:29:18,872
Not because that
complaint is irrelevant.

806
01:29:23,501 --> 01:29:26,584
That is not the way a police
officer must behave to anyone...

807
01:29:26,585 --> 01:29:27,785
not only to an offender.

808
01:30:28,085 --> 01:30:33,918
Brother it is me. I must meet you.
You don't have to come here.

809
01:30:34,751 --> 01:30:38,210
Can you come to Avenue Regent
by tomorrow evening by seven o'clock?

810
01:30:38,460 --> 01:30:39,626
Tomorrow.

811
01:30:40,085 --> 01:30:43,668
Only fifteen minutes will do. it is
dead urgent brother that is why.

812
01:30:45,043 --> 01:30:46,210
I will come.

813
01:30:48,376 --> 01:30:49,727
Husband must not know this.

814
01:31:14,001 --> 01:31:15,168
Ordered the tea.

815
01:31:15,335 --> 01:31:17,418
Tea? When did you start?

816
01:31:21,001 --> 01:31:24,543
Brother you have changed
a lot, looks like you are tired.

817
01:31:28,043 --> 01:31:30,876
After getting discharged,
you never came there.

818
01:31:31,918 --> 01:31:35,335
I was about to come
there within two days.

819
01:31:35,668 --> 01:31:39,751
When I tell you to come,
you will say tomorrow.

820
01:31:59,918 --> 01:32:02,960
Husband must not
know that we had met here.

821
01:32:04,210 --> 01:32:11,210
That is because I need to speak
about my husband that is why.

822
01:32:12,501 --> 01:32:16,585
For the last few days, it
seems he had changed a lot.

823
01:32:17,543 --> 01:32:21,668
Brooding over something
and silence for lot of times.

824
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:27,960
Brother as you know, he
used to tell everything to me.

825
01:32:28,251 --> 01:32:30,835
Even the smallest tensions
he confronts on job.

826
01:32:31,626 --> 01:32:33,835
But this is becoming.

827
01:32:39,418 --> 01:32:41,460
Looks like he is not at all happy.

828
01:32:42,668 --> 01:32:44,585
Had he told
anything to you Brother?

829
01:32:45,085 --> 01:32:47,793
No, nothing like that.

830
01:32:48,835 --> 01:32:50,335
Shock on Aryan's death.

831
01:32:50,585 --> 01:32:55,043
Your accident, first I
thought it might be the reason.

832
01:32:55,918 --> 01:33:02,918
But now I think, there is something
beyond it. You must talk to him.

833
01:33:04,043 --> 01:33:08,001
Without any speech you both,
understand each other.

834
01:33:09,626 --> 01:33:13,460
Brother, I got only you,
to say all these things.

835
01:33:33,126 --> 01:33:34,210
What is it brother?

836
01:33:46,376 --> 01:33:51,376
Yes, some car like this. I'm not sure.
I cannot tell this was the car.

837
01:33:55,543 --> 01:33:59,335
Is it the same color?
But it was the same green.

838
01:35:03,418 --> 01:35:05,500
Started taking the list of blue cars,

839
01:35:05,501 --> 01:35:07,801
- enormous in number
will take some time.

840
01:35:09,810 --> 01:35:13,101
Without getting a strong evidence
against Captain Sreenivas...

841
01:35:13,168 --> 01:35:14,668
do not trouble him further.

842
01:35:15,835 --> 01:35:18,793
Maybe, it can be a
mistake from our side.

843
01:35:19,418 --> 01:35:22,501
Just because the car
doesn't belong to him,

844
01:35:22,668 --> 01:35:24,292
- how can we free him like that?

845
01:35:24,293 --> 01:35:27,792
Aryan sir, had one and
only enemy that is him!

846
01:35:27,793 --> 01:35:30,710
In the case file, he is
still now the prime suspect.

847
01:35:31,085 --> 01:35:32,268
Don't you remember?

848
01:35:32,310 --> 01:35:35,059
Since I remember, that is
why I'm telling you Rakhi...

849
01:35:35,060 --> 01:35:37,393
to change him from that position.

850
01:35:42,626 --> 01:35:46,335
I had brought that ASI, who was
drunk on duty, to make him march.

851
01:35:46,501 --> 01:35:50,418
Before the march he
had requested, to meet you.

852
01:35:51,085 --> 01:35:52,285
Tell him to come inside.

853
01:36:04,251 --> 01:36:06,918
What man, new kind of habits?

854
01:36:07,126 --> 01:36:11,801
Sir, kindly relieve me,
only three more years to go.

855
01:36:11,803 --> 01:36:14,560
Within this period, I had
never had any bad behavior...

856
01:36:14,562 --> 01:36:16,354
never received any memo.

857
01:36:16,501 --> 01:36:18,459
After retiring and sitting at home,

858
01:36:18,460 --> 01:36:21,110
- only to remember my only
wish is orderly room march.

859
01:36:21,210 --> 01:36:23,676
Till my death, that will
not fade from my heart.

860
01:36:26,618 --> 01:36:29,976
Sudhakara, how can you say like
that? Everything has got it's...

861
01:36:30,043 --> 01:36:30,793
Enough of it.

862
01:36:31,251 --> 01:36:36,543
Once we enter the service, we
all take a pledge, police oath.

863
01:36:37,085 --> 01:36:39,960
No need to have March,
just say it words.

864
01:36:42,751 --> 01:36:43,959
I'll bring a copy.

865
01:36:43,960 --> 01:36:46,335
You can just tell him
that, he will repeat it.

866
01:36:48,585 --> 01:36:50,876
No, I don't know,
to say without looking.

867
01:36:52,585 --> 01:36:58,751
For me also, I can't remember,
since many years have passed.

868
01:37:02,918 --> 01:37:04,001
I will sir.

869
01:37:06,001 --> 01:37:12,335
I'm Sudhakaran Nair. I will be
faithful and honest to my country,

870
01:37:12,501 --> 01:37:14,543
- India and its constitution.

871
01:37:14,751 --> 01:37:18,417
As a member of Kerala Police force.

872
01:37:18,418 --> 01:37:23,751
I will discharge my duties,
honestly, faithfully and un-biased.

873
01:37:23,918 --> 01:37:29,876
Biased, favoritism, hatred,
vengeance will work beyond this,

874
01:37:30,043 --> 01:37:33,435
...and best of my ability,
knowledge and skill.

875
01:37:33,501 --> 01:37:36,476
As written in the constitution,
I will discharge my duties.

876
01:37:36,543 --> 01:37:39,543
To protect the dignity
and rights of the individuals.

877
01:37:39,710 --> 01:37:43,584
In accordance with the dignity
of the police, as a police officer,

878
01:37:43,585 --> 01:37:49,751
I'll discharge my duties. Bestowed
on me. I solemnly take the pledge.

879
01:37:59,251 --> 01:38:02,209
Yesterday, my daughter went
to Bangalore, to join MBA,

880
01:38:02,210 --> 01:38:03,960
- as I went to take her to the bus.

881
01:38:04,043 --> 01:38:06,494
All others were the
children of high profiled men.

882
01:38:06,501 --> 01:38:10,043
She insisted on me to go,
before the bus leaves.

883
01:38:10,210 --> 01:38:15,251
First I didn't understand, later I came
to know, she was ashamed to say,

884
01:38:15,318 --> 01:38:17,459
she is the daughter
of a police officer.

885
01:38:17,460 --> 01:38:20,584
In the mist of her friends
this 'Kaki' is a disgust to her,

886
01:38:20,585 --> 01:38:25,168
while I was busy with duty,
seldom knew she had grown up.

887
01:38:25,585 --> 01:38:28,209
I didn't have time to
closely know my daughter,

888
01:38:28,210 --> 01:38:33,335
no time for anything.
But this is my friend.

889
01:38:34,168 --> 01:38:37,918
When she disdained this,
I could not tolerate.

890
01:38:39,043 --> 01:38:42,251
That is why, for the first time...

891
01:38:46,251 --> 01:38:49,668
On retiring I know, a police
has got the value of a dog.

892
01:38:50,251 --> 01:38:53,710
Sir, when this thing gets on your
body, there is a feeling of pride.

893
01:38:54,793 --> 01:38:57,876
Which nothing else can
give. Nothing at all!

894
01:38:59,210 --> 01:39:00,460
Never done any fraud.

895
01:39:01,210 --> 01:39:05,501
Till now, till this moment, never did
I leave anyone, without helping.

896
01:39:06,293 --> 01:39:10,501
With the balance three years
I will say with my head straight.

897
01:39:10,835 --> 01:39:13,501
I'm ASI Sudhakaran.

898
01:41:23,251 --> 01:41:26,710
I thought of meeting
you, in between.

899
01:41:28,626 --> 01:41:32,335
I had resigned my job, this
is one month notice period...

900
01:41:32,585 --> 01:41:34,210
after that I'll go to Mumbai.

901
01:41:34,376 --> 01:41:36,668
My parents are all
there, as you know.

902
01:41:39,543 --> 01:41:44,668
I don't think I will
come back. Back here...

903
01:41:47,376 --> 01:41:48,976
For one month, I'm staying here.

904
01:41:49,085 --> 01:41:51,750
That day, just before the accident,

905
01:41:51,751 --> 01:41:54,125
- I had demanded one
thing from Antony.

906
01:41:54,126 --> 01:41:57,126
For that, only for that!

907
01:42:00,918 --> 01:42:04,543
Father is asking you,
come, food is served.

908
01:42:30,626 --> 01:42:32,668
Where is Rebecca
staying in Cochin?

909
01:42:45,001 --> 01:42:49,585
I had checked the register, just
before the accident, you had come here.

910
01:42:50,835 --> 01:42:54,543
Twenty minutes before, just before
you said, you had found the culprit.

911
01:42:57,960 --> 01:43:00,501
That vital clue is from here.

912
01:43:26,585 --> 01:43:29,126
I had informed, not to
let anyone, for some time.

913
01:43:36,543 --> 01:43:39,335
That day, at the Rebeccas
flat, topic of our discussion.

914
01:43:39,501 --> 01:43:44,126
Must be documented
as part of our investigation.

915
01:43:45,210 --> 01:43:49,043
Usually it is done at the
camp office. But in this case...

916
01:43:51,168 --> 01:43:54,293
What you told me on that
day, must be repeated again.

917
01:43:58,918 --> 01:44:01,376
I told Antony, as a private matter.

918
01:44:01,378 --> 01:44:04,085
Those things which I told,
because I was determined...

919
01:44:04,088 --> 01:44:05,655
Antony must know it.

920
01:44:05,657 --> 01:44:07,366
Nobody else knows it.

921
01:44:08,251 --> 01:44:12,210
Antony had assured me, that it will
be used for any official purpose.

922
01:44:15,751 --> 01:44:18,501
Things are not like that, as before.

923
01:44:36,585 --> 01:44:38,543
If you don't cooperate...

924
01:44:41,585 --> 01:44:45,543
You cannot make me tell anything,
on a threatening tone like that.

925
01:44:46,001 --> 01:44:50,085
If you want to make my request,
documented, on finding the culprit...

926
01:44:50,251 --> 01:44:52,543
on Aryan's death, I'm ready.

927
01:44:53,585 --> 01:44:56,085
But if it is that visual
I showed you, on that day.

928
01:44:56,168 --> 01:44:59,335
If it is what you purport... No.

929
01:45:01,001 --> 01:45:03,960
May be for that you
can seize my mobile.

930
01:45:04,168 --> 01:45:08,168
You will never get that visual!

931
01:45:20,793 --> 01:45:23,210
I thought you were a friend!

932
01:45:47,251 --> 01:45:48,250
Remove that!

933
01:45:48,251 --> 01:45:52,017
When the wife comes in engagement dress...
it must be shot by husband first.

934
01:45:52,018 --> 01:45:53,351
Not any videographers.

935
01:45:53,418 --> 01:45:56,501
This is not worn properly. Stop it.

936
01:45:56,585 --> 01:45:59,443
Then you will show this to
everyone, is that what you do?

937
01:45:59,445 --> 01:46:00,595
Hey this is your phone!

938
01:46:00,597 --> 01:46:05,146
Tell, from today onwards
in joy and in sorrow.

939
01:46:05,293 --> 01:46:05,918
Go man!

940
01:46:09,543 --> 01:46:13,584
Okay, Mister Aryan John Jacob
is now called up on to receive...

941
01:46:13,585 --> 01:46:14,626
the Gallantry award.

942
01:46:18,418 --> 01:46:19,043
Talk.

943
01:46:19,210 --> 01:46:19,984
What?

944
01:46:19,985 --> 01:46:22,218
After collecting your award,
you should render a speech.

945
01:46:22,220 --> 01:46:22,845
Come on.

946
01:46:23,876 --> 01:46:26,001
You hear, when I tell tomorrow.

947
01:46:36,251 --> 01:46:42,626
Dear brother and sisters,
to all my humble greetings.

948
01:46:43,585 --> 01:46:45,885
Too bad! Is this the
way you are going to tell?

949
01:46:52,460 --> 01:46:55,793
I was never a good police officer

950
01:46:56,335 --> 01:47:01,085
- and I don't know how a
good police officer should be.

951
01:47:01,418 --> 01:47:04,418
On standing here, today
with this gallantry award.

952
01:47:04,668 --> 01:47:08,917
I know myself, for a below
average, officer like me,

953
01:47:08,918 --> 01:47:11,460
- this is, how much
undeserving it is to me.

954
01:47:12,043 --> 01:47:13,417
Not out of undue modesty.

955
01:47:13,418 --> 01:47:17,168
But the truth. Behind my every
success, the strength is...

956
01:47:17,235 --> 01:47:19,385
Even though, not
telling a cliché statement.

957
01:47:19,387 --> 01:47:22,179
As far as I'm concerned,
I need to be little personal...

958
01:47:22,182 --> 01:47:23,722
or else it may not be complete.

959
01:47:23,724 --> 01:47:27,849
In my life, many a time's friends
have gone and come.

960
01:47:28,335 --> 01:47:29,985
Lonely childhood at the boarding,

961
01:47:30,043 --> 01:47:35,835
- mother's death, a seven year
forgot, through the same aged friends.

962
01:47:36,376 --> 01:47:40,917
I realized, I had only them to tell and
share, I tried to cling on to them.

963
01:47:40,918 --> 01:47:42,710
- Not to lose.

964
01:47:42,876 --> 01:47:47,043
But, after a period, every one
scattered to various routes.

965
01:47:47,251 --> 01:47:53,918
I tried to search some of them,
but couldn't. Then one day.

966
01:47:54,126 --> 01:47:59,292
A friend walked in to my life,
without welcoming.

967
01:47:59,293 --> 01:48:04,043
I was bored by everyone else,
somewhere down the line.

968
01:48:04,251 --> 01:48:07,335
One and only friend, a friend
who stood by me at all times.

969
01:48:07,751 --> 01:48:13,668
Whenever, I'm in need of, at any
time of night, in any danger I'm stacked.

970
01:48:13,835 --> 01:48:17,250
Who told me, I'm there!
Friend who vouched for me.

971
01:48:17,251 --> 01:48:19,585
A friend who cannot be replaced.

972
01:48:21,126 --> 01:48:24,668
This gallantry award
was also given to me by him.

973
01:48:25,251 --> 01:48:29,335
Never had I killed any terrorist. I
do not possess a brilliance for it.

974
01:48:29,793 --> 01:48:33,418
It was done by him.
This belongs for him.

975
01:48:33,585 --> 01:48:38,043
Lots of good days, which I
possessed after several years...

976
01:48:38,251 --> 01:48:40,168
also belongs to him.

977
01:48:42,043 --> 01:48:45,460
My good days, my biggest prayer
is, not to include his name,

978
01:48:45,626 --> 01:48:47,793
among the friends lost.

979
01:48:49,418 --> 01:48:53,835
We have not met, to
depart in any cross roads of life.

980
01:48:54,126 --> 01:48:55,251
Even if we depart.

981
01:48:55,543 --> 01:48:59,168
We will meet again in
some other cross road.

982
01:49:00,126 --> 01:49:04,460
We will stroll together,
where ever the path ends.

983
01:49:13,918 --> 01:49:16,460
This is for you, only for you!

984
01:49:24,418 --> 01:49:26,668
Within a day, you become a hero.

985
01:49:30,418 --> 01:49:35,418
Even if on a lie, I just wanted Aryan
must be remembered, my selfishness.

986
01:49:36,293 --> 01:49:38,094
Though Aryan never
had such a desire.

987
01:50:02,085 --> 01:50:07,501
If this is that vital clue, on seeing
this, if had identified the culprit.

988
01:50:08,168 --> 01:50:09,868
There is only one answer for that,

989
01:50:11,460 --> 01:50:13,835
credit of Gallantry award
must not come to me!

990
01:50:14,043 --> 01:50:18,084
Someone wanted, that way.
I might have called you,

991
01:50:18,085 --> 01:50:20,235
- after I had recognized
who that person is.

992
01:50:21,710 --> 01:50:24,710
If anything like that is
desired, that is Rebecca. Is it not?

993
01:50:30,043 --> 01:50:33,343
She only wanted to maintain that
respect, which Aryan had received.

994
01:50:33,793 --> 01:50:35,344
When a beloved person had left,

995
01:50:35,585 --> 01:50:41,085
she only had this, for him,
only this to do for him.

996
01:50:41,585 --> 01:50:44,876
Beyond that she
had no other intentions.

997
01:50:45,585 --> 01:50:46,835
That means.

998
01:50:47,918 --> 01:50:49,676
Some one knew it before...

999
01:50:49,743 --> 01:50:52,385
this is what Aryan proposed
to say at the function.

1000
01:50:52,501 --> 01:50:55,418
Someone who was determined
that I must not be honored.

1001
01:50:56,376 --> 01:51:01,668
In this present condition of mine,
I cannot identify the foe who is hidden.

1002
01:51:18,001 --> 01:51:21,042
A professional sharp shooter
will first of all familiarize,

1003
01:51:21,043 --> 01:51:22,743
the location where he is standing.

1004
01:51:22,918 --> 01:51:24,960
Study the each and
every angle of it.

1005
01:51:25,376 --> 01:51:28,918
In this case, this stage and ground.

1006
01:51:29,126 --> 01:51:33,376
During the time of firing, the
spot where we are standing.

1007
01:51:43,751 --> 01:51:45,460
Is it from here, it was fired?

1008
01:51:45,876 --> 01:51:46,543
Yes.

1009
01:51:47,793 --> 01:51:48,875
Why is that?

1010
01:51:48,876 --> 01:51:54,710
This is not a good choice. First of all
it is very open, audience will notice it.

1011
01:51:55,043 --> 01:52:00,626
Then on aiming at a person behind
the dais, is this the position?

1012
01:52:01,626 --> 01:52:03,543
This is not at all favorable,

1013
01:52:04,835 --> 01:52:11,001
see the building has got cross
ventilation. There will be wind.

1014
01:52:11,918 --> 01:52:13,768
Since it is a gunshot, from this far.

1015
01:52:14,168 --> 01:52:18,543
Wind will affect the line of air. The
chances are more, to lose the aim.

1016
01:52:20,585 --> 01:52:25,626
But as per the ballistic experts, this
building the chances are more.

1017
01:52:25,960 --> 01:52:30,335
That I don't know.
Not a route to escape.

1018
01:52:31,335 --> 01:52:35,042
We have got some evidences
from here, like chili powder.

1019
01:52:35,043 --> 01:52:38,751
That is all done by us,
to divert the police.

1020
01:53:07,126 --> 01:53:11,626
Why to choose a place like that,
when an ideal place like this is here, sir.

1021
01:53:11,835 --> 01:53:13,750
How come there are
no residents here?

1022
01:53:13,751 --> 01:53:15,585
No, the work is not complete.

1023
01:53:16,043 --> 01:53:23,043
More close to the target.
How is your modus operandi?

1024
01:53:36,626 --> 01:53:38,960
Will find out an ideal place to fire.

1025
01:53:39,293 --> 01:53:42,950
If this is the building,
this will be the position.

1026
01:53:42,951 --> 01:53:46,125
As far as possible, he will reach
here, on the previous day.

1027
01:53:46,126 --> 01:53:48,960
When the target comes,
will wait for the right moment.

1028
01:53:51,001 --> 01:53:52,460
Which is the right moment?

1029
01:53:52,751 --> 01:53:54,168
First given opportunity.

1030
01:53:56,918 --> 01:54:00,368
When he gets the target at the gun
point, at ease, that is the moment.

1031
01:54:06,585 --> 01:54:09,960
From here, gunpoint
will be following him.

1032
01:54:19,501 --> 01:54:21,668
So this is the first opportunity.

1033
01:54:21,876 --> 01:54:24,168
No, can you scroll back?

1034
01:54:31,751 --> 01:54:36,210
This is the first given opportunity.

1035
01:54:36,501 --> 01:54:41,335
45 seconds completely unprotected
without any obstacles in the front.

1036
01:54:42,210 --> 01:54:46,085
Any professional sharp
shooter will fire at this point.

1037
01:54:46,918 --> 01:54:50,835
Then why is it, that
it was not utilized?

1038
01:54:52,585 --> 01:54:56,043
But one thing is sure,
we will not leave it.

1039
01:54:57,585 --> 01:54:59,168
Or else, it was already...

1040
01:55:01,335 --> 01:55:03,500
Sir, you said it was a perfect crime.

1041
01:55:03,501 --> 01:55:04,209
Yes.

1042
01:55:04,210 --> 01:55:08,459
One more possibility is there. In a
perfect crime, the finest perfection.

1043
01:55:08,460 --> 01:55:13,501
The biggest brain... on the time of
crime, the killer was not there.

1044
01:55:14,460 --> 01:55:19,043
During the time of firing,
there was no shooter here.

1045
01:55:20,751 --> 01:55:23,410
'Timer-gun' that can
be set beforehand.

1046
01:55:27,743 --> 01:55:30,625
The position, where the
target will stand for definite...

1047
01:55:30,626 --> 01:55:34,135
aim the gun to that position.
A most modern weapon.

1048
01:55:34,176 --> 01:55:37,768
One can get the parts importing its
parts in several times shipments,

1049
01:55:37,835 --> 01:55:40,635
- a person who is adept in
this, can easily assemble it.

1050
01:55:40,701 --> 01:55:46,517
Either by remote control or with the partner sim, that is
placed in the... gun, with a mobile phone from anywhere...

1051
01:55:46,518 --> 01:55:49,268
it can be operated
on the exact time.

1052
01:55:50,626 --> 01:55:53,327
Not necessary, there must
be a shooter, near the rifle.

1053
01:55:53,418 --> 01:55:54,835
He can be anywhere.

1054
01:56:04,376 --> 01:56:05,126
Run!

1055
01:56:15,793 --> 01:56:17,335
No sir, not clear.

1056
01:56:30,210 --> 01:56:32,918
In that case who is this?

1057
01:56:35,751 --> 01:56:39,542
Till yesterday all the police force in
all the metros were on the search...

1058
01:56:39,543 --> 01:56:42,501
for this face. Just
because, you told so.

1059
01:56:42,710 --> 01:56:47,418
You are the person who told, when we find out
this person... this case will be proved.

1060
01:56:47,751 --> 01:56:53,835
Now you are telling, from such a
distance, a face cannot be seen clearly.

1061
01:56:59,335 --> 01:57:03,001
From the verdict of a sharp shooter
who has been introduced by you.

1062
01:57:03,168 --> 01:57:06,501
He says firing has not
occurred from that building.

1063
01:57:06,710 --> 01:57:11,792
Then on what ground had you
investigated on that building alone?

1064
01:57:11,793 --> 01:57:13,918
From what the ballistic
experts had told.

1065
01:57:14,085 --> 01:57:17,376
Your team had found out
what the ballistic experts said.

1066
01:57:20,460 --> 01:57:23,001
For your assurance,
he will tell directly to you.

1067
01:57:33,218 --> 01:57:36,684
As per the discussion what we had
on that day, we had a conclusion.

1068
01:57:36,685 --> 01:57:40,042
That the gun shot had come from
a near - by building at the stadium.

1069
01:57:40,043 --> 01:57:44,960
I had told sir, clearly that more possibilities are on the...
building at the left hand side.

1070
01:57:45,126 --> 01:57:47,718
Today morning when
the Rakhi madam told me...

1071
01:57:47,720 --> 01:57:51,160
I came to know that the police team
never had gone to that building.

1072
01:57:51,163 --> 01:57:54,372
They had only concentrated on
the right hand side building only.

1073
01:57:54,918 --> 01:57:58,210
But of course, since sir had
seen a person running from there.

1074
01:57:58,276 --> 01:58:01,576
Now, he is on a confusion, whether
a person like that really exist.

1075
01:58:01,651 --> 01:58:06,325
You said there is an eyewitness, for a car that
was parked... near that building is it not?

1076
01:58:06,326 --> 01:58:07,325
That is there.

1077
01:58:07,326 --> 01:58:10,660
That is a basic brain work,
any intelligent criminal can do.

1078
01:58:12,918 --> 01:58:16,501
You must explain why you
had not investigated at all...

1079
01:58:16,668 --> 01:58:18,368
to the possibilities cited by him.

1080
01:58:20,543 --> 01:58:23,717
Not only on this, every day sir
is correcting the case dairy...

1081
01:58:23,719 --> 01:58:27,459
the suspects and mode of
operandi keeps on changing.

1082
01:58:27,460 --> 01:58:29,584
With no explanation for anything.

1083
01:58:29,585 --> 01:58:32,251
He told to free Captain
Sreenivasn, agreed.

1084
01:58:32,418 --> 01:58:38,167
We have got no evidence against
him. But Roy, whose name is there,

1085
01:58:38,168 --> 01:58:40,968
- in the criminal records.
There is no follow-ups on him.

1086
01:58:43,001 --> 01:58:45,751
I'm pretty sure Roy is not
involved in this that is why.

1087
01:58:46,335 --> 01:58:48,292
Is that an explanation sir?

1088
01:58:48,293 --> 01:58:51,917
As per Antony sir's instructions,
this person was included in the...

1089
01:58:51,918 --> 01:58:53,818
investigation team.
Sudhakaran, please.

1090
01:58:58,251 --> 01:59:00,085
This is the venue to speak go head!

1091
01:59:00,751 --> 01:59:05,501
I had lost hope on this case,
kindly deploy me from this case.

1092
01:59:06,460 --> 01:59:08,510
That is the same,
I also have to tell sir.

1093
01:59:10,751 --> 01:59:16,293
I'm desiring to continue in this team,
honestly we all want to continue.

1094
01:59:16,668 --> 01:59:19,460
But the team leader
should be another person.

1095
01:59:35,585 --> 01:59:38,751
Sir, got the list of blue cars,
got the details of owners also,

1096
01:59:38,918 --> 01:59:40,768
...there nothing suspicious about it.

1097
01:59:40,876 --> 01:59:42,984
Only passing on an information.

1098
01:59:42,985 --> 01:59:45,285
For the past three
months there is a blue car,

1099
01:59:45,287 --> 01:59:47,220
...which is under
police custody here.

1100
01:59:47,222 --> 01:59:51,722
But to use this, as you know, only
a person from the department can.

1101
01:59:53,751 --> 01:59:57,043
As I told you sir, just
informed you on taking the list.

1102
02:00:12,918 --> 02:00:14,750
From the time allotted for me...

1103
02:00:14,751 --> 02:00:18,793
for investigation there
are two more days left.

1104
02:00:19,626 --> 02:00:25,168
Within those two days...
I'll give you all answers... All.

1105
02:00:27,960 --> 02:00:31,668
We all believe, you are
trying to save someone.

1106
02:00:32,085 --> 02:00:36,085
When I say all answers, there
will be name of the culprit also.

1107
02:00:40,543 --> 02:00:44,960
I'm near to it... Very near.

1108
02:00:50,085 --> 02:00:51,886
Sir will come now, he is on the way.

1109
02:00:53,251 --> 02:00:55,952
Whatever your decision is,
tell it to the Commissioner.

1110
02:01:18,918 --> 02:01:25,918
He is trying to save some one that is
what they say. He, Antony Moses.

1111
02:01:31,418 --> 02:01:34,251
My team has demanded
a better person than me.

1112
02:01:35,085 --> 02:01:38,501
But for two days you must trust me.

1113
02:01:41,126 --> 02:01:45,126
For a police officer, I'm not only
asking the time to prove a case.

1114
02:01:48,376 --> 02:01:51,917
But for a person who doesn't
know his future or past.

1115
02:01:51,918 --> 02:01:55,318
This is also a time for him, to make
him believe that he is existing.

1116
02:04:25,585 --> 02:04:27,251
Why is this place all untidy?

1117
02:05:03,376 --> 02:05:07,043
I got an offer from Emirates,
probably I'll accept that.

1118
02:05:07,251 --> 02:05:09,543
That will be Cochin - Dubai sector.

1119
02:05:09,710 --> 02:05:16,501
More relaxed better money. It also
means, I will be more in Cochin.

1120
02:06:41,085 --> 02:06:42,001
Who are you?

1121
02:06:45,876 --> 02:06:48,210
I can't understand.

1122
02:06:56,543 --> 02:06:58,193
Or did you get any better option?

1123
02:07:00,793 --> 02:07:02,585
So that is the reason.

1124
02:07:04,735 --> 02:07:07,201
All this time you were
using me, is it not?

1125
02:07:07,210 --> 02:07:08,835
Get lost you!

1126
02:08:45,501 --> 02:08:51,168
As told, the last page
is still left behind.

1127
02:08:56,251 --> 02:09:00,501
You are one to fill it up!

1128
02:09:19,293 --> 02:09:24,001
List of calls that came to your
phone on the day of accident.

1129
02:09:27,668 --> 02:09:31,751
This is the last call, I made it to you.

1130
02:09:38,585 --> 02:09:44,001
That means, what I had
told you, on that day had gone...

1131
02:09:44,168 --> 02:09:45,585
...to your voice mail box.

1132
02:09:53,710 --> 02:09:58,426
My voice is safely recorded in
the service provider's server.

1133
02:10:06,343 --> 02:10:09,535
I had even told the name
of the culprit on that day...

1134
02:10:09,626 --> 02:10:13,793
...except that you hide from me.

1135
02:10:16,835 --> 02:10:21,501
You wanted evidences, how... Why?

1136
02:10:22,835 --> 02:10:26,626
You wanted Antony
Moses to find that out.

1137
02:10:29,418 --> 02:10:32,710
As one Antony Moses shut all the
doors to safe guard the culprit.

1138
02:10:33,460 --> 02:10:38,168
With another Antony Moses,
using him you opened it again.

1139
02:10:49,918 --> 02:10:52,668
Now, the very last page.

1140
02:12:23,543 --> 02:12:25,917
Especially, when
there are people in life...

1141
02:12:25,918 --> 02:12:27,768
who can come without
ringing the bell.

1142
02:12:31,751 --> 02:12:34,051
I didn't sit here to
interfere in your privacy.

1143
02:12:34,918 --> 02:12:39,001
Just because I will never come here
again, so thought of seeing and going.

1144
02:12:49,126 --> 02:12:52,126
I don't want explanation for
what I have seen in front of me.

1145
02:12:59,251 --> 02:13:03,368
Your life... Your wishes,
you must have told me.

1146
02:13:03,635 --> 02:13:06,285
On account of this, I'll never
disdain the friendship.

1147
02:13:06,326 --> 02:13:08,468
I wouldn't have asked
for any explanation,

1148
02:13:08,470 --> 02:13:10,553
but now, I doubt in
what all situations.

1149
02:13:10,626 --> 02:13:13,376
I will be duped, which I'm
not aware of. Including that!

1150
02:13:14,293 --> 02:13:18,085
With this intention of yours, you
granted a Gallantry award to me.

1151
02:13:21,585 --> 02:13:22,959
Your kind of talking...

1152
02:13:22,960 --> 02:13:25,876
For offenders, a night mare!
Notorious way of assault!

1153
02:13:26,168 --> 02:13:29,668
Dangerous violence, with
no leaps and bounds.

1154
02:13:32,251 --> 02:13:36,710
Everything a face mask to
conceal your impotence.

1155
02:13:38,085 --> 02:13:40,035
You denied women,
those who respected...

1156
02:13:40,126 --> 02:13:42,376
you as an epitome of
manhood are just fools!

1157
02:13:52,126 --> 02:13:53,960
We both will never talk.

1158
02:13:54,293 --> 02:13:57,343
But when the criminal tendencies
of an ACP is displayed and...

1159
02:13:57,460 --> 02:13:59,160
one realizes the reason behind it.

1160
02:13:59,418 --> 02:14:02,501
What should the other
ACP do, in the same city?

1161
02:14:04,168 --> 02:14:07,210
There will be also some
protocol in the department.

1162
02:14:29,543 --> 02:14:31,085
He will create trouble man.

1163
02:14:32,585 --> 02:14:34,168
Have not heard what he told?

1164
02:14:37,626 --> 02:14:39,210
He will tell this outside.

1165
02:14:45,626 --> 02:14:47,135
Media will be after you!

1166
02:14:50,037 --> 02:14:52,196
What will be your
status in the department?

1167
02:14:52,198 --> 02:14:53,948
How will you face your colleagues?

1168
02:14:54,918 --> 02:14:57,418
Those who salutes
you will make fun of you.

1169
02:15:08,626 --> 02:15:13,126
When this is exposed do
you think her life will be smooth?

1170
02:15:24,960 --> 02:15:26,543
You think of my situation.

1171
02:15:44,293 --> 02:15:47,244
That whole night we tried him
over the phone, several times.

1172
02:15:48,335 --> 02:15:51,293
After calling him, many a times
he didn't pick up the phone.

1173
02:15:51,918 --> 02:15:56,960
As he never responded to us, we
were sure he was up to something.

1174
02:17:09,793 --> 02:17:11,594
I was never a good police officer...

1175
02:17:11,751 --> 02:17:15,251
and I don't know how a
good police officer should be.

1176
02:17:15,501 --> 02:17:18,668
On standing here, today
with this gallantry award.

1177
02:17:19,001 --> 02:17:23,501
I know myself, for a below
average, officer like me, this is,

1178
02:17:23,668 --> 02:17:26,168
- how much undeserving it is to me.

1179
02:17:26,376 --> 02:17:30,168
In my life, many a time's
friends have gone and come.

1180
02:17:30,376 --> 02:17:34,418
But, after a period, every one
scattered to various routes.

1181
02:17:35,043 --> 02:17:36,126
Then one day.

1182
02:17:36,418 --> 02:17:40,835
A friend walked in to
my life, without welcoming.

1183
02:17:41,710 --> 02:17:45,042
I was bored by everyone else,
somewhere down the line.

1184
02:17:45,043 --> 02:17:49,251
One and only friend, a friend
who stood by me at all times.

1185
02:17:49,668 --> 02:17:52,625
Whenever, I'm in need of...

1186
02:17:52,626 --> 02:17:55,585
- at any time of night, in
any danger I'm stacked.

1187
02:17:55,835 --> 02:17:58,835
Who told me, I'm there!
Friend who vouched for me.

1188
02:17:59,001 --> 02:18:01,043
A friend who cannot be replaced.

1189
02:18:02,251 --> 02:18:05,876
This gallantry award was
also given to me by him.

1190
02:18:06,251 --> 02:18:10,210
Never had I killed any terrorist.
I do not possess a brilliance for it.

1191
02:18:10,793 --> 02:18:14,335
It was done by him.
This belongs for him.

1192
02:18:14,543 --> 02:18:20,418
My biggest prayer is, not to include
his name, among the friends I lost.

1193
02:18:20,751 --> 02:18:27,084
We have not met, to depart in any
cross roads of life. Even if we depart.

1194
02:18:27,085 --> 02:18:31,043
We will meet again
in some other cross road.

1195
02:18:32,043 --> 02:18:36,293
We will stroll together,
where ever the path ends.

1196
02:18:45,376 --> 02:18:48,376
This is for you, only for you!

1197
02:18:54,085 --> 02:18:58,668
Aryan had not valued
anyone like this, even to me.

1198
02:18:59,501 --> 02:19:03,084
I never expected such
an un-official visit,

1199
02:19:03,085 --> 02:19:05,035
Un-official way of
taking the statement.

1200
02:19:05,043 --> 02:19:08,417
As I told you before...

1201
02:19:08,418 --> 02:19:10,968
in the statement this
clipping must not be included.

1202
02:19:13,918 --> 02:19:19,451
As few, fears this will case will fade
on to nowhere. I'll not believe that.

1203
02:19:19,453 --> 02:19:22,653
As far as I know, the person
who is investigating this case...

1204
02:19:22,655 --> 02:19:25,155
knows the intensity of the
loss, as much as I knew.

1205
02:19:25,418 --> 02:19:27,750
This case will not fade
in to an unsolved case,

1206
02:19:27,751 --> 02:19:31,085
if anybody else does. I'm
pretty sure that, Antony cannot.

1207
02:19:58,210 --> 02:20:02,335
However, it may be, everywhere I go it is
never more than a... premium status symbols.

1208
02:20:02,337 --> 02:20:05,237
Nothing more than this,
I had not shown any undue respect,

1209
02:20:05,239 --> 02:20:06,614
I've found the culprit!

1210
02:20:12,918 --> 02:20:14,584
On standing here...

1211
02:20:14,585 --> 02:20:18,543
it is the biggest honor one can
achieve in the police force.

1212
02:20:18,751 --> 02:20:22,585
I know myself, for a below
average, officer like me...

1213
02:20:27,085 --> 02:20:31,335
I'm the one who killed him!

1214
02:20:55,043 --> 02:20:59,293
Farhan here sir,
I need to report an arrest.

1215
02:21:22,085 --> 02:21:26,251
After coming back to life,
Farhan was nobody to me.

1216
02:21:28,043 --> 02:21:29,460
Aryan was nobody to me.

1217
02:21:54,168 --> 02:21:55,825
I Antony Moses.

1218
02:21:55,826 --> 02:21:59,642
I will be faithful and honest to my
country, India and its constitution.

1219
02:21:59,643 --> 02:22:05,568
I will discharge my duties,
honestly, faithfully and un-biased.

1220
02:22:06,376 --> 02:22:10,000
In accordance with the dignity
of the police, as a police officer,

1221
02:22:10,001 --> 02:22:12,500
I'll discharge my duties.

1222
02:22:12,501 --> 02:22:14,876
Bestowed on me.
I solemnly take the pledge.
