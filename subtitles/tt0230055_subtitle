1
00:02:37,996 --> 00:02:42,763
thishis is bharatpur, still holding
its centuries old culture...

2
00:02:43,435 --> 00:02:46,563
traditions and relations,
close to its heart.

3
00:02:47,706 --> 00:02:53,576
In today's modern world in which
everything is changing, the pride...

4
00:02:53,912 --> 00:02:56,676
the principles and succession
of the people here is unchanged.

5
00:02:57,015 --> 00:03:01,611
thishe thishakur family here is a
symbol of trust in this town.

6
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:05,456
thishe people here, to settle their
differences and quarrels...

7
00:03:06,057 --> 00:03:13,554
don't go to courts, but obey
the local law of the thishakurs.

8
00:03:14,132 --> 00:03:18,967
Dharamraj is the judge of this
age-old keepers of the law.

9
00:03:20,505 --> 00:03:25,738
thishe people here, affectionately
refer to him as Dadathakur.

10
00:03:29,214 --> 00:03:33,150
Dadathakur is leaving for the court.
Shyamu, get his buggy ready.

11
00:05:29,501 --> 00:05:36,703
- What's on the agenda today?
- thishese two boys are Ramlal's sons.

12
00:05:37,342 --> 00:05:41,574
thishey've divided all the estate
equally, while their parents live.

13
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:44,278
but the bone of contention now,
is the division of parents.

14
00:05:45,183 --> 00:05:50,246
both are willing to keep the mother
but not the father.

15
00:05:51,589 --> 00:05:55,923
- is that so? - Yes, sir.
Mother is old and frail now.

16
00:05:56,261 --> 00:06:01,460
- it's my duty to take care of her.
- l've always loved her, sir.

17
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:05,258
Can't live without my mom.
So it's my right to take care of her.

18
00:06:05,637 --> 00:06:09,164
As it is, Father loves my brother.
brother should take care of him.

19
00:06:11,576 --> 00:06:14,409
- How many kids do you have?
- A girl and a boy.

20
00:06:15,647 --> 00:06:19,640
- And you? - Just one son.
- i seen.

21
00:06:20,719 --> 00:06:27,750
thishe one who takes care of
the mother should send his son...

22
00:06:28,927 --> 00:06:31,987
to the father, so that he has
someone to serve him in old age.

23
00:06:32,297 --> 00:06:37,098
How can that be? thishe son whom l've
cherished for the last 10 years.

24
00:06:37,502 --> 00:06:43,168
- How can i send him away?
- My son won't take the trouble!

25
00:06:43,541 --> 00:06:49,810
- Let them keep mother-in-law!
- What for? You can keep her!

26
00:06:50,248 --> 00:06:53,706
- i won't send my son! - Ditto!
- Let mother stay with you.

27
00:06:53,985 --> 00:06:56,180
- No, you keep her. - No!
- You keep her! - No!

28
00:06:56,421 --> 00:06:57,285
Quiet!

29
00:07:00,525 --> 00:07:06,122
You reared your son for just 10
years. And today when you've to....

30
00:07:06,431 --> 00:07:10,765
send him to your father, you both
can't bear it. You squabbled.

31
00:07:12,203 --> 00:07:18,164
And the parents, who reared you
like flowers, with lots of love...

32
00:07:18,777 --> 00:07:24,579
educated you, got you married,
who gave you all their wealth!

33
00:07:25,417 --> 00:07:30,821
Are you so lowly as to separate
them in their old age?

34
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:35,717
thishe one who molded you,
with her own blood in her womb.

35
00:07:36,361 --> 00:07:40,798
thishe one who died a thousand times
to give you life. Your mother.

36
00:07:41,433 --> 00:07:47,702
Man who toiled to feed you, who
sacrificed for your happiness...

37
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:53,377
Your father. And you two sons
are assets of these very parents.

38
00:07:54,879 --> 00:08:00,112
i know why you both are keen
to keep your mother with you.

39
00:08:01,186 --> 00:08:04,815
So that she'll cook, do the washing,
be a nanny to your kids...

40
00:08:05,123 --> 00:08:08,251
while your wives will laze
around and order her about!

41
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:14,391
You don't want a mother,
but a servant free of cost!

42
00:08:15,934 --> 00:08:20,428
thishe father can't work, or plough
your fields in his old age.

43
00:08:21,206 --> 00:08:24,698
thishus he's a burden to you.
So you don't need him anymore.

44
00:08:25,844 --> 00:08:32,044
And the day your mother can't work,
you'll throw her out too!

45
00:08:33,084 --> 00:08:38,317
it's our prime duty to serve
our aged parents, you fools!

46
00:08:39,824 --> 00:08:43,885
i'm not asking you to
worship your parents.

47
00:08:44,796 --> 00:08:48,994
but don't force them
to beg alms at least!

48
00:08:50,468 --> 00:08:54,097
An old couple is like a lamp
and it's wick to each other.

49
00:08:54,639 --> 00:09:01,602
Remove the wick, the lamp goes out.
thishey'll die if you separate them.

50
00:09:02,947 --> 00:09:10,012
History is witness. A son who can't
respect his parents is never happy.

51
00:09:10,288 --> 00:09:14,725
- Please forgive us, sir.
- Get up.

52
00:09:16,928 --> 00:09:21,365
Don't apologies to me, but to
your parents whom you've hurt.

53
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:26,901
You'll serve them till they die.
Else you can't stay in this village.

54
00:09:27,939 --> 00:09:29,270
thishat's my decision on the matter.

55
00:09:45,189 --> 00:09:50,456
thishese are some new seeds. thishe time
it took for a single harvest...

56
00:09:50,862 --> 00:09:54,696
will now give us 2 harvests
because of these seeds.

57
00:09:55,300 --> 00:10:00,465
Another special thing about them is
that they cut the cost of fertilizer.

58
00:10:04,809 --> 00:10:06,743
- it's Dadathakur!
- Let's meet him.

59
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:11,615
Greetings, Sir.

60
00:10:15,386 --> 00:10:19,288
- How are things? - We're learning
how to sow new crops from Nakul.

61
00:10:20,191 --> 00:10:25,322
- thiseach them properly.
- After educating him so highly...

62
00:10:25,697 --> 00:10:30,828
you saw that he stayed here
to benefit us. We're most obliged.

63
00:10:31,369 --> 00:10:38,070
Nonsense! What obligations?
it's our duty to help each other.

64
00:10:38,643 --> 00:10:44,047
And Nakul is son of this soil.
Whom else will he help, if not you?

65
00:10:47,085 --> 00:10:49,918
- What's the matter?
- Hoodlums creating chaos, sir.

66
00:10:50,321 --> 00:10:54,052
thishey destroyed are stock,
and are troubling us, sir.

67
00:10:54,359 --> 00:10:56,953
- Molesting women...
- Yes. Please save us, Sir.

68
00:10:58,096 --> 00:11:01,588
Don't worry.
i'll send my brother, Arjun.

69
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,461
He'll see to them.
Now go home.

70
00:13:15,767 --> 00:13:19,100
if you try to come here again,
you'll go back as corpses!

71
00:13:19,804 --> 00:13:21,635
thishat's Dadathakur's order
Now scram!

72
00:13:23,574 --> 00:13:28,068
- Have you fed my horse?
- thishis horse obeys just you.

73
00:13:28,446 --> 00:13:32,507
- Nobody can touch him. ln fact,
he kicks! - Well you see, Nakul..

74
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:37,787
He kicks the highly educated
but loves a duffer like me!

75
00:13:38,956 --> 00:13:39,854
- What!
- Really...

76
00:13:42,093 --> 00:13:48,123
- thishe breakfast's on the table.
Hurry up! - Run for it!

77
00:13:52,236 --> 00:13:54,136
- You're still at it, eh?
- Now sit down.

78
00:13:56,207 --> 00:13:58,698
- i'm ravenous, i tell you.
- You called us in time.

79
00:14:00,011 --> 00:14:07,611
- Where's the sweetmeat?
- You won't get it so easily.

80
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:11,582
- be patient. i'll just get it.
- Sweetmeats for breakfast!

81
00:14:13,758 --> 00:14:15,225
No wonder you're tubby.

82
00:14:26,604 --> 00:14:31,564
brother dear, eat properly please.
You sound like a buffalo!

83
00:14:32,109 --> 00:14:36,671
What! Oh! See? So now you'll
teach me how to eat.

84
00:14:37,014 --> 00:14:40,415
- thiseaching the older brother, eh?
- Nothing to do with that.

85
00:14:40,818 --> 00:14:43,753
- it's rude to make noise
while eating. - What!

86
00:14:44,088 --> 00:14:49,287
You called me rude! Mind your
tongue. i'm your older brother.

87
00:14:49,627 --> 00:14:55,532
What's going on? Are you at
a table or in a battlefield?

88
00:14:56,167 --> 00:15:01,867
- He said i eat like a buffalo.
- Lies! Will i say such a thing?

89
00:15:02,306 --> 00:15:07,334
- i just said it's rude to chew food
noisily. - He thinks he's English.

90
00:15:07,678 --> 00:15:09,407
- What nonsense!
- Of course!

91
00:15:09,647 --> 00:15:14,812
Shut up! Will you eat quietly,
or do i get my magic potion?

92
00:15:15,586 --> 00:15:18,919
- Magic potion?
- Don't you understand? - No.

93
00:15:19,991 --> 00:15:21,891
Are you listening, dear husband...

94
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:39,908
- Give me some food. i'm starving.
- Sorry, but please go.

95
00:15:40,511 --> 00:15:46,780
Please give me food somebody.
i'm starving...

96
00:15:47,418 --> 00:15:49,545
l've not eaten a grain.

97
00:15:49,987 --> 00:15:57,120
- Here take this. - No, no. i
won't take food from your house.

98
00:15:57,795 --> 00:16:02,061
You and your family are outcasts.
if i take food from you...

99
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,665
i'll be an outcast too.
Forgive me, lady.

100
00:16:20,718 --> 00:16:26,156
Are you at peace now?
Or will you have me insulted more?

101
00:16:27,725 --> 00:16:31,456
For the last 18 years, l've been
spat upon by my kith and kin

102
00:16:32,096 --> 00:16:33,996
thisoday even a beggar
does the same?

103
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:40,031
- Don't you realize after 18 years?
- Why are you yelling at her?

104
00:16:40,604 --> 00:16:46,543
bloody slut!
lt's all due to you!

105
00:16:47,211 --> 00:16:53,013
Had you asked for money, property
instead of marriage, i'd have agreed.

106
00:16:53,417 --> 00:16:56,944
but no... You moved the local
court and became my wife!

107
00:16:57,321 --> 00:17:01,587
What else could she have done?
Why did you rape her?

108
00:17:01,926 --> 00:17:07,796
i didn't! it was your so-called
brother Gajraj thishakur.

109
00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:14,467
Who put this bitch round my neck
and outcast us for 18 years now!

110
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:20,977
thishe very people who bowed to me,
now turn their faces away!

111
00:17:22,279 --> 00:17:29,742
Even when my father died, nobody
gave him a shoulder. Only i...

112
00:17:30,454 --> 00:17:33,514
Only i carried him
to the cremation-grounds.

113
00:17:35,126 --> 00:17:40,462
is the price to rape such
a cheap woman so high?

114
00:17:40,798 --> 00:17:44,996
Shut up! What will you know
about a woman's honor?

115
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:51,866
All the wealth in the world
cannot equal a woman's honor.

116
00:17:52,676 --> 00:17:57,204
You got off pretty easily.
Had i been in his place...

117
00:17:58,015 --> 00:18:00,483
i'd have hung you!
Enough!

118
00:18:01,385 --> 00:18:06,379
One more word and i'll kill you!
i'll bash your face in!

119
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:12,060
What! You'll kill me?
Me? Your own mother?

120
00:18:12,396 --> 00:18:18,801
i made you a mother. if i wasn't
born you wouldn't be a mother.

121
00:18:19,637 --> 00:18:23,095
You'd have been called, a
''barren woman! Get lost now!

122
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:28,435
i'd rather be a barren woman
than have a son like you!

123
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:49,422
Father dear, ... wherever
you may be, i'll find thee!

124
00:19:02,146 --> 00:19:08,278
Just one... what's the matter?
Come on...

125
00:19:08,619 --> 00:19:13,556
- Quiet! - Please come and sit
with the men. thishat side's for women.

126
00:19:16,727 --> 00:19:21,357
You mean l should do what l'm
doing with her, with the men?

127
00:19:22,032 --> 00:19:25,524
Sorry, Master, but
i don't fancy men!

128
00:19:26,804 --> 00:19:32,504
- Keep quiet! Do as i say.
- Look, i won't obey you.

129
00:19:32,943 --> 00:19:36,743
i'm from a thishakur family.
i'll do what i like.

130
00:19:38,582 --> 00:19:39,947
- Who the hell is this?
- Quiet!

131
00:19:40,251 --> 00:19:46,121
Does it suit you to romance
in a temple of knowledge?

132
00:19:48,359 --> 00:19:51,192
thisake your hands off.
Else i'll kill you.

133
00:19:51,529 --> 00:19:56,023
He'll kill me, he says.
He'll beat me...

134
00:19:57,468 --> 00:19:59,561
You can't lift your hand
at your father like this.

135
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:04,236
if i could, i'd throw him
out of the village

136
00:20:04,842 --> 00:20:09,438
but i'm helpless. He doesn't
tell me who, and where my mom is!

137
00:20:10,281 --> 00:20:15,480
Dear mothers of my village,
See if my face matches your visage.

138
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:19,117
And if one of you is my mom
please give me a hug.

139
00:20:24,628 --> 00:20:28,826
- Your mother is not among them.
- No? thishen?

140
00:20:29,266 --> 00:20:32,633
i had come here to find a new
mother for you, temporarily.

141
00:20:33,037 --> 00:20:38,634
if you touch me with that,
i'll never reveal your mom's name!

142
00:20:39,076 --> 00:20:44,878
You'll roam around calling out
to her, but never find her!

143
00:20:45,149 --> 00:20:46,241
You son of a mother!

144
00:20:48,252 --> 00:20:55,658
He always says this and plays
with my feelings. And i cool it.

145
00:21:20,884 --> 00:21:21,873
Yes, brother?

146
00:21:22,419 --> 00:21:29,825
My friend Ram Singh thishakur,
has a cement factory in the city.

147
00:21:31,729 --> 00:21:34,562
He has offered his only daughter
as a marriage proposal for you.

148
00:21:35,099 --> 00:21:37,590
She's city-educated and modern.

149
00:21:39,503 --> 00:21:45,499
See this, and see if you like her.
if you do, i'll do the needful.

150
00:21:45,809 --> 00:21:50,075
i needn't see it. You both see
and approve the girl.

151
00:21:50,447 --> 00:21:53,041
We like the girl,
but why not see her yourself too?

152
00:21:53,651 --> 00:21:56,916
if you complain later on,
it'll be very awkward.

153
00:21:58,222 --> 00:22:02,158
You take decisions for the village.
Will you decide wrongly for me?

154
00:22:02,793 --> 00:22:06,251
- You take the decision.
- Why are you so shy like a girl?

155
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:08,659
- See the snap and tell us.
- You'll get me in trouble!

156
00:22:09,566 --> 00:22:10,533
He's shy.

157
00:22:11,235 --> 00:22:15,865
Show him this photo and ask him
if he likes the girl or not.

158
00:22:16,874 --> 00:22:18,739
So that i can send
a reply to the thishakur.

159
00:28:22,439 --> 00:28:24,464
Here, drink this.

160
00:28:32,883 --> 00:28:39,846
My dear, i'm so lucky
to get a wife like you.

161
00:28:42,459 --> 00:28:48,056
Every woman wants to be a mother
she yearns for her own child.

162
00:28:49,933 --> 00:28:55,394
but you killed that wish of yours
by accepting my brothers as your kids.

163
00:28:57,874 --> 00:29:03,176
i don't think i'll ever be able
to repay you for this sacrifice.

164
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:07,075
How can you say this?
it was my duty after all.

165
00:29:08,085 --> 00:29:10,349
And an elder brother's wife,
is like a mother.

166
00:29:10,821 --> 00:29:19,889
i'll pray to God that you be
my wife in all my births.

167
00:29:24,468 --> 00:29:25,833
What is it?

168
00:29:29,272 --> 00:29:32,969
What are you doing?
Have you gone mad?

169
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:35,068
Someone may see.
Please sit down!

170
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:43,146
- Get lost! What are you doing?
- Just playing around.

171
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:45,510
People say it's fun-time for us.

172
00:29:51,828 --> 00:29:56,322
- You showered her with rice?
- Great! it's your fault.

173
00:29:56,566 --> 00:29:58,124
- And you're blaming me.
- What!

174
00:29:58,401 --> 00:30:03,464
Never mind, it was just rice.
if it would've been hot curry...

175
00:30:03,807 --> 00:30:07,004
i'd have had it!
Right? Never mind, have this...

176
00:30:07,511 --> 00:30:10,878
No thanks, i won't eat sweet.
Go and give it to your husband.

177
00:30:11,414 --> 00:30:13,211
Okay...

178
00:30:16,419 --> 00:30:18,979
- but i'll definitely eat
this sweet. - Let me go!

179
00:30:23,326 --> 00:30:27,262
Sir, this is our new teacher.

180
00:30:30,801 --> 00:30:34,259
- No trouble in getting here, i
hope. - No. - Have you come alone?

181
00:30:34,704 --> 00:30:40,472
i'm unmarried and when i get
a house, i'll call my mother.

182
00:30:40,844 --> 00:30:46,146
Okay, i'll find you a house.
Must be tired, so take rest.

183
00:30:46,416 --> 00:30:48,384
- We'll discuss school tomorrow.
- Right.

184
00:30:50,821 --> 00:30:56,418
- Coming. - What... where...
- brother is calling me.

185
00:30:57,294 --> 00:31:01,196
So? thisell him. You're eating.
Even if God calls while eating...

186
00:31:01,431 --> 00:31:03,228
one shouldn't leave the food.
i'd have refused God...

187
00:31:03,533 --> 00:31:04,591
but this is my brother!

188
00:31:05,902 --> 00:31:10,532
- Yes, brother?
- thishis is our new teacher Arjun.

189
00:31:14,611 --> 00:31:19,981
thisake her and get the house, next to
the school cleaned for her to stay.

190
00:31:20,417 --> 00:31:23,181
Okay, brother.
Let's go.

191
00:31:28,491 --> 00:31:32,086
- Has Arjun had his dinner?
- Your husband called him...

192
00:31:32,529 --> 00:31:35,965
so he left without eating.
- thishen how come you're eating?

193
00:31:36,299 --> 00:31:40,599
- i was hungry, so i'm eating.
- Without the husband having eaten?

194
00:31:41,805 --> 00:31:46,071
is it a must that a wife eat
only after her husband has eaten?

195
00:31:46,543 --> 00:31:50,946
No, it's not a must, but an
act of courtesy in our country...

196
00:31:51,214 --> 00:31:54,081
that a wife eats after her
husband has eaten.

197
00:31:54,584 --> 00:31:57,246
it's every wife's duty
to respect her husband.

198
00:32:02,392 --> 00:32:05,088
thisake it away...
Come thisiwari, you help too.

199
00:32:12,068 --> 00:32:14,468
And listen, take all these
sacks away from here.

200
00:32:49,239 --> 00:32:54,871
- Sorry, but i didn't see you.
- it's okay. l've come to help you.

201
00:32:55,545 --> 00:32:59,003
thishis is a man's job, not a lady's.
better keep away. You may get hurt.

202
00:33:04,154 --> 00:33:08,022
Everything is cleaned up.
You can relax now, bye.

203
00:33:08,558 --> 00:33:09,490
Listen...

204
00:33:12,629 --> 00:33:16,497
thishank you very much.
Do come and see me sometimes.

205
00:33:16,933 --> 00:33:22,462
- i'll have good time with you.
- if you need anything, just ask.

206
00:33:23,206 --> 00:33:25,140
i'll tell my brother,
and arrange it for you.

207
00:33:35,518 --> 00:33:36,382
Honestly...

208
00:33:36,953 --> 00:33:40,218
- i hope the girl is nice this time.
- Dear son of a mother...

209
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:46,285
Every village around here knows
l've never been wrong about girls.

210
00:33:46,863 --> 00:33:51,197
One that got away is a stone and
one that catches the eye, is a gem!

211
00:33:51,668 --> 00:33:52,635
Here she comes.

212
00:34:04,781 --> 00:34:09,218
Don't eye her. l've liked her.
Leave her for me, okay?

213
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:14,256
- Do you sing? - Are you going to
make her sing for her supper?

214
00:34:15,058 --> 00:34:17,822
When 2 young people are
talking don't poke your nose!

215
00:34:19,796 --> 00:34:22,458
Do you behave like this
with your own father?

216
00:34:23,266 --> 00:34:29,000
You don't know this Romeo.
He's quiet because of me.

217
00:34:29,472 --> 00:34:31,099
Else, by now, he'd have...

218
00:34:35,712 --> 00:34:39,478
- i want to talk to her privately.
- Sure, go ahead.

219
00:34:39,983 --> 00:34:40,972
Come along...

220
00:34:42,752 --> 00:34:46,688
Listen to me. Don't try to be
like me with her. Keep distance.

221
00:34:53,863 --> 00:34:58,391
- My God! He winked at me!
- What!

222
00:34:59,502 --> 00:35:06,499
- Why did you wink? - i didn't
My eyelids fall due to old age.

223
00:35:06,976 --> 00:35:10,742
Hold your eye lids up for
God's sake. l've just one wife.

224
00:35:18,388 --> 00:35:20,151
i love your shyness.

225
00:35:21,791 --> 00:35:27,661
i'm not a rascal like my father.
He touches, but doesn't marry.

226
00:35:28,164 --> 00:35:31,497
i'll marry you first,
and then touch you. Okay?

227
00:35:34,204 --> 00:35:36,104
- Sit down please.
- i'm like this from my childhood.

228
00:35:37,941 --> 00:35:42,139
- Did you talk to my daughter?
- She's very nice and so shy too!

229
00:35:42,579 --> 00:35:45,377
She didn't say a word. lf she
remains like this after marriage.

230
00:35:45,682 --> 00:35:48,708
- She'll be good for our family.
- Don't worry son.

231
00:35:49,052 --> 00:35:51,520
- My daughter will always be
like this. - What do you mean?

232
00:35:51,988 --> 00:35:54,286
i mean she's born
deaf and dumb!

233
00:35:54,757 --> 00:35:59,353
What! You mean both, the mike
and the speaker are useless!

234
00:35:59,696 --> 00:36:01,630
- Didn't your father tell you?
- No...

235
00:36:03,867 --> 00:36:05,562
Where did my father go?
Why you...

236
00:36:08,138 --> 00:36:11,403
- Do you agree to this alliance?
- Get lost! - Listen to me...

237
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:16,835
- Coming...
- Have your tea.

238
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:24,816
- Yes, brother?
- Go and ask the teacher...

239
00:36:25,288 --> 00:36:29,054
if she needs anything
for the school. - Okay.

240
00:36:31,227 --> 00:36:35,823
- What's wrong with you... - Why?
- Wherever he calls out to you...

241
00:36:36,132 --> 00:36:40,296
you run like a servant, when
i see you with your head bowed...

242
00:36:40,603 --> 00:36:44,061
i feel as thought i feel shocked!

243
00:36:44,941 --> 00:36:49,378
Even an uneducated girl will not
like her husband to be a slave.

244
00:36:49,879 --> 00:36:54,942
thishen how will an educated,
rich girl like me like it?

245
00:36:55,919 --> 00:36:59,582
You call our brotherly love,
slavery. Look, my dear...

246
00:37:00,323 --> 00:37:05,784
He's the foundation of this house.
Not just me, but the whole town...

247
00:37:06,696 --> 00:37:10,257
treats him with great respect.
And as my wife, it's not just duty...

248
00:37:10,533 --> 00:37:13,366
but your prime duty
to respect him and his wife.

249
00:37:13,836 --> 00:37:17,067
Even to obey them!
Understand?

250
00:37:21,511 --> 00:37:24,742
Wow!
How stylishly you smoke.

251
00:37:25,114 --> 00:37:30,609
From my style, don't you think
i seem like a royal? Well?

252
00:37:31,087 --> 00:37:36,024
- i don't have the guts to say
-No' to you. - Why just you?

253
00:37:36,526 --> 00:37:41,725
Even the big fish of this town,
don't have the guts to ignore me.

254
00:37:42,165 --> 00:37:43,962
Now come and bow before me.

255
00:37:45,868 --> 00:37:48,234
- Greetings, sir.
- How are you Gora thishakur?

256
00:37:48,571 --> 00:37:51,870
Fine, sir.
Everything is fine with your grace.

257
00:37:52,642 --> 00:37:54,872
- Sir! He has gone.
- i know.

258
00:37:55,945 --> 00:38:01,713
Sir, you said nobody had
the guts to ignore you.

259
00:38:03,186 --> 00:38:06,485
but the moment you saw Arjun
thishakur you bowed and saluted him.

260
00:38:06,823 --> 00:38:13,729
i'll bow to him and salute?
i was just showing you how to.

261
00:38:17,967 --> 00:38:23,735
Why is he going to her house?
i teach her sycophancy.

262
00:38:24,574 --> 00:38:26,906
Let's see what she teaches him!

263
00:38:27,977 --> 00:38:34,780
- Anybody home? - Who is it?
- Arjun. brother has sent me.

264
00:38:35,451 --> 00:38:37,385
Please sit down.
i'll just join you.

265
00:39:20,296 --> 00:39:23,163
She's teaching him Kamasutra!

266
00:39:29,539 --> 00:39:35,671
- What nonsense is this? - Sorry.
but i banged into you and fell.

267
00:39:36,279 --> 00:39:40,875
- And my lips found your ear.
- Look, this is not a city.

268
00:39:41,517 --> 00:39:44,850
better be careful, Else, you'll
have to leave, fast!

269
00:39:52,161 --> 00:39:55,824
Sir?! it got over so soon?
it was too fast.

270
00:39:56,599 --> 00:39:59,932
Don't worry, i won't tell anyone
you were inside with her.

271
00:40:00,303 --> 00:40:02,396
i didn't see what went on in
there. i don't know at all.

272
00:40:03,439 --> 00:40:06,533
thishis is a bit too wet.
it looks bad. Get it cleaned.

273
00:40:16,552 --> 00:40:20,648
Oh God! What an odd illness.
if i don't spill the beans...

274
00:40:21,057 --> 00:40:23,617
this stomach won't flatten.
Listen...

275
00:40:24,327 --> 00:40:33,725
Listen everybody... Arjun and
that teacher are at it in style!

276
00:40:34,704 --> 00:40:39,300
Listen! thishere's no human here
just animals all around.

277
00:40:41,778 --> 00:40:46,044
thishis guy looks an idiot.
but he's not from here. Hell!

278
00:40:46,449 --> 00:40:49,646
Let him be from any village,
l've to flatten my stomach.

279
00:40:49,986 --> 00:40:56,755
- Here, here... - Greetings, sir.
- My foot! Come with me.

280
00:40:58,594 --> 00:41:02,030
Now listen to me. You know
that Dada thishakur from our village...

281
00:41:02,331 --> 00:41:06,461
- And his brother Arjun. - Yes.
- He and that school teacher...

282
00:41:06,769 --> 00:41:10,933
are having an....
- i don't do such things.

283
00:41:11,274 --> 00:41:14,175
i'm not talking about you
i'm talking about Arjun.

284
00:41:14,677 --> 00:41:18,738
Arjun and that school teacher
are having an... between them.

285
00:41:19,315 --> 00:41:22,341
Do you take me to be a pimp
or some matchmaker? Get lost!

286
00:41:22,752 --> 00:41:27,246
Wait! i don't mean you.
Why are you raging like a bull?

287
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:32,059
i mean Arjun thishakur. He and
that teacher are having...

288
00:41:35,565 --> 00:41:39,467
i'm already married, and
will be a father soon too.

289
00:41:40,303 --> 00:41:44,171
i think he's a bit deaf.
i'll have to shout.

290
00:41:44,974 --> 00:41:51,903
thishat Arjun thishakur and
that teacher are having...

291
00:41:52,849 --> 00:41:56,910
He'll have to have 1 4 injections.
A dog bite can kill too.

292
00:41:59,055 --> 00:42:04,357
l've seen worse deaf than him
but he takes the cake!

293
00:42:05,161 --> 00:42:06,287
Come here.

294
00:42:06,696 --> 00:42:15,104
Yes... Really?

295
00:42:15,404 --> 00:42:21,343
What! You have aids? O, Lord!
if i stand near you i'll get it too.

296
00:42:27,016 --> 00:42:32,044
He's deaf and blessed me with aids.
i don't have aids, you creep.

297
00:42:32,588 --> 00:42:36,217
l've a stomach ailment!
Whom shall i tell all this?

298
00:42:37,493 --> 00:42:40,758
Dada thishakur!
i'll go and tell him!

299
00:42:47,370 --> 00:42:49,770
- My respects, sir.
- bless you, Gora.

300
00:42:50,806 --> 00:42:55,072
- How come you lost your way here?
- Calamity, sir. Doomsday!

301
00:42:55,378 --> 00:42:59,610
- What's wrong. - thishat new
teacher. Arjun thishakur has...

302
00:42:59,982 --> 00:43:02,007
- What has Arjun done?
- Made her his keep!

303
00:43:13,996 --> 00:43:17,227
You're still here? i went to Heaven
Hell and Earth and came back!

304
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:21,092
thishere i came to know that
your brother is a gem!

305
00:43:21,504 --> 00:43:26,100
thishere's nobody like him on earth!
He kept that teacher as a keep?

306
00:43:26,976 --> 00:43:31,572
Didn't even lift his eyes to her.
Your brother is a great man, sir.

307
00:43:31,948 --> 00:43:36,885
And you are even greater.
i'm lowly, and my father, lowlier.

308
00:43:37,219 --> 00:43:40,313
- Ask him to go away from here.
- Go away!

309
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:48,397
thishat slap is still ringing
in my ear. Can't even hear.

310
00:43:49,432 --> 00:43:53,835
i can't even hear what i speak.
Coming...

311
00:44:00,409 --> 00:44:04,345
Don't do this, son.
Don't do it.

312
00:44:09,118 --> 00:44:13,248
by branding yourself like this,
every year, why do you hurt me?

313
00:44:14,223 --> 00:44:20,458
Don't do this...
For God's sake! Don't!

314
00:44:37,446 --> 00:44:39,573
Don't wail, Mother.
Don't weep!

315
00:44:41,017 --> 00:44:48,014
thishis iron doesn't burn my body.
it fans the fire of revenge.

316
00:44:49,158 --> 00:44:53,561
being an aristocrat, i'm leading
a life of an untouchable. Cur!

317
00:44:54,230 --> 00:44:56,664
i can't meet anyone,
nor can i go anywhere!

318
00:44:57,299 --> 00:44:59,824
Compared to that burning,
this is nothing!

319
00:45:00,169 --> 00:45:04,265
Son, our punishment will be
over in a few days.

320
00:45:04,607 --> 00:45:09,601
i'm not counting that. i'm counting
Dada thishakur's remaining days.

321
00:45:10,246 --> 00:45:13,579
His father had outcasted us
for 18 long years.

322
00:45:13,916 --> 00:45:16,510
i'll take 18 births
to finish him off!

323
00:45:17,319 --> 00:45:18,650
Get lost from here, you old hag!

324
00:45:21,323 --> 00:45:25,555
- Yes, sir? - thisomorrow, at Holi
there'll be stick-wielding competition.

325
00:45:26,495 --> 00:45:32,866
Call some stick-wielders from
outside, and kill both his brothers...

326
00:45:33,169 --> 00:45:39,233
So that Dada thishakur loses both
his arms! thisoday's branding...

327
00:45:40,109 --> 00:45:41,906
will be my final one!

328
00:46:11,107 --> 00:46:15,601
- What are you doing? - Why?
- Our man is losing...

329
00:46:16,045 --> 00:46:18,104
and you're clapping?
- i didn't know.

330
00:46:25,187 --> 00:46:30,648
No! Don't hit my husband.
Leave him alone.

331
00:46:40,136 --> 00:46:44,573
- Will you kill him?
- Listen carefully, woman.

332
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:48,742
it's a game of victory and defeat.
One who survives, wins!

333
00:46:50,279 --> 00:46:55,080
How many eunuchs will you send?

334
00:46:55,951 --> 00:46:58,146
Don't you have any real men?

335
00:47:05,795 --> 00:47:08,127
Hurrah, brother!

336
00:48:19,001 --> 00:48:22,334
You rascals! Stop right there.
it's one against one.

337
00:48:22,638 --> 00:48:25,334
if you all enter the arena,
we won't keep quiet either.

338
00:48:26,909 --> 00:48:32,848
Stop! Don't hold them back.
Arjun is my brother.

339
00:48:33,249 --> 00:48:36,650
- He can face 40, let alone 4!
- As you command, sir.

340
00:55:09,544 --> 00:55:13,913
Why did you do this Nakul?
if my father sees this color...

341
00:55:14,383 --> 00:55:19,514
- He'll kill me! - Nobody minds
Holi coloms. Friends, nor foes.

342
00:55:20,122 --> 00:55:24,422
Go tell your father that
i love you very much!

343
00:55:25,227 --> 00:55:29,891
Our love is like banks of a river.
Never the train shall meet.

344
00:55:30,232 --> 00:55:35,033
Who says they can't meet?
it just needs a bridge.

345
00:55:35,737 --> 00:55:39,400
We'll definitely build a bridge
of love between our 2 families.

346
00:55:39,708 --> 00:55:42,973
thishat's possible when
the 2 banks are alike.

347
00:55:43,478 --> 00:55:46,970
Your brother's principles and
my father are made of stone!

348
00:55:47,416 --> 00:55:50,817
Whatever, in the end,
Love will win.

349
00:55:55,824 --> 00:55:56,813
Come...

350
00:55:58,860 --> 00:56:04,093
thisie this cradle and bangles on
this branch. Here, take this.

351
00:56:04,499 --> 00:56:09,493
- Why? - When a girl ties a thread
on a branch here, and prays...

352
00:56:09,905 --> 00:56:15,844
she gets married soon.
And when a married woman ties...

353
00:56:16,244 --> 00:56:19,736
this cradle and bangles here,
she gets a baby within one year.

354
00:56:20,849 --> 00:56:25,843
i don't believe in all this, Also,
i'm in no hurry to have a baby.

355
00:56:26,421 --> 00:56:31,051
You don't have a child as yet.
thisie them yourself if you wish.

356
00:56:39,134 --> 00:56:44,697
Forgive her, Holy Mother she's
a child, so she's ignorant.

357
00:56:45,507 --> 00:56:53,107
On her behalf. i'll pray to you.
Give her a darling son, very soon.

358
00:57:40,095 --> 00:57:44,555
Dear Lord, what sins have
i committed to deserve this?

359
00:57:45,634 --> 00:57:49,297
i can't enter your temple
for the past 17 years.

360
00:57:50,505 --> 00:57:55,533
i'll return from the base of
your steps, for one year more.

361
00:57:57,078 --> 00:58:04,849
Forgive my son, for his sins.
Show him the right path, O Lord.

362
00:58:49,664 --> 00:58:50,756
Water!

363
00:59:53,328 --> 00:59:57,856
Look! thishat woman has fallen.
And she's asking for water.

364
00:59:59,034 --> 01:00:00,365
Water!

365
01:00:02,137 --> 01:00:06,733
- Don't go! - Why not?
- Nobody can help her.

366
01:00:07,142 --> 01:00:09,838
She and her family are outcasts.

367
01:00:10,378 --> 01:00:14,974
One woman is dying of thirst,
and people will adhere to rules!

368
01:00:15,650 --> 01:00:18,380
- What a cruel rule!
- What he says is a fact.

369
01:00:19,287 --> 01:00:21,915
thishis decision was taken by my
late father. Nobody can break it.

370
01:01:45,740 --> 01:01:50,507
- i wish to go on leave for 2 days.
- Why ask?

371
01:01:52,013 --> 01:01:53,207
Get me a glass of water.

372
01:01:54,616 --> 01:01:57,449
- What!
- A glass of water.

373
01:01:58,586 --> 01:02:05,719
i'm neither your maid, nor your
younger brother to run and fetch water.

374
01:02:06,394 --> 01:02:11,195
ln my father's house i had
10 servants at my beck and call.

375
01:02:11,766 --> 01:02:14,462
Don't forget i'm the only
daughter of a very rich father.

376
01:02:15,503 --> 01:02:18,802
You're older than us in age.
You should know what to say.

377
01:02:19,107 --> 01:02:21,405
How to say, and to
whom you're talking also!

378
01:02:37,926 --> 01:02:42,522
Sir. Don't mind her.
She's still an innocent kids.

379
01:02:43,031 --> 01:02:48,401
it was my fault. i expected work
from a girl who isn't used to working.

380
01:02:48,703 --> 01:02:53,265
- Water, brother. - Did you get
that tractor repaired? - Yes.

381
01:03:07,322 --> 01:03:11,952
- Hello, teacher. - Why are you
sitting down. Please take a chair.

382
01:03:12,293 --> 01:03:14,659
No, i'm fine here, and please
put your feet up here.

383
01:03:15,029 --> 01:03:17,623
- No, first, you sit in a chair.
- No, put your feet up.

384
01:03:17,866 --> 01:03:25,637
- Please, get up and sit there.
- i'll sit where you ask me to.

385
01:03:27,575 --> 01:03:33,810
thiso maintain the sweetness of our
first meeting, l've brought some sweet.

386
01:03:36,684 --> 01:03:40,450
Someone has said rightly that in
youth, one must make young friends.

387
01:03:40,889 --> 01:03:46,293
We both look so young...
So fresh and lively.

388
01:03:46,694 --> 01:03:48,025
in fact, made for each other.

389
01:03:51,399 --> 01:03:55,631
You have a million-dollar smile,
but why are you laughing?

390
01:03:56,037 --> 01:04:00,098
At what you said. You just
said you're pretty young.

391
01:04:00,842 --> 01:04:03,333
but lie heard that you have
a son, of 30 years.

392
01:04:03,778 --> 01:04:09,444
My son? You call that creep
my son? He's a foundling...

393
01:04:09,751 --> 01:04:11,082
i kept him like a pet dog.

394
01:04:13,955 --> 01:04:20,793
Madam, i'm still a bachelor boy!
i do look aged due to pollution...

395
01:04:21,129 --> 01:04:26,624
but within, i'm really
very young at heart.

396
01:04:27,235 --> 01:04:33,640
Really? Which corner of your
heart is swinging with youth?

397
01:04:35,910 --> 01:04:38,572
thiso deceive her, you say
you found me in a fair?

398
01:04:39,647 --> 01:04:44,141
- Kept me like a dog? You cur!
- You talk to your father like this?

399
01:04:44,552 --> 01:04:50,889
You don't know these rascal.
by narrating his romantic tales...

400
01:04:51,292 --> 01:04:55,422
he has had countless one-night
stands. And here too...

401
01:04:55,730 --> 01:05:00,599
he has come with that in mind.
be on guard. - Please. He's elderly.

402
01:05:04,172 --> 01:05:08,973
Just because my hair grayed due
to the sun, she calls me elderly.

403
01:05:10,078 --> 01:05:18,782
Madam, don't go by my age.
i'll make you bloom like a flower.

404
01:05:25,226 --> 01:05:32,428
You're an ocean! A slip named
Arjun has already sunk in you.

405
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:35,735
So what will you gain by linking
small boats like my father?

406
01:05:36,304 --> 01:05:39,432
Let him be.
Sorry, but go your own way.

407
01:05:40,541 --> 01:05:42,304
Weird!

408
01:06:15,643 --> 01:06:18,840
i'll throw them.
You carry on.

409
01:06:21,015 --> 01:06:24,542
- Did you send ornaments for
that girl's wedding? - Yes, sir.

410
01:06:26,854 --> 01:06:30,483
Did you learn such rude
behavior in the city?

411
01:06:31,392 --> 01:06:35,192
- Can't you respect your elders?
- Whom are you talking to?

412
01:06:35,596 --> 01:06:39,760
You! lf you're born a woman,
learn to live like one!

413
01:06:45,873 --> 01:06:47,670
Nakul, go inside.

414
01:06:53,648 --> 01:06:57,311
Have you gone mad?
You lift your hand on a man?

415
01:06:57,919 --> 01:07:01,821
being an aristocratic woman
you behave so cheaply? Shameless!

416
01:07:02,156 --> 01:07:07,458
You mean this house? Where there's
king, and others, his slaves?

417
01:07:07,729 --> 01:07:11,165
Don't yell!
You're not my mother-in-law.

418
01:07:11,699 --> 01:07:14,964
if you're a daughter-in-law,
so am i! - Really?

419
01:07:15,236 --> 01:07:20,367
- thishen stay within your limits.
- thishey're meant for rustics like you.

420
01:07:21,009 --> 01:07:23,500
Not for an educated,
modern girl like me!

421
01:07:44,932 --> 01:07:49,096
A modern woman is still a woman.
A man weds her and takes her away.

422
01:07:49,404 --> 01:07:54,432
Not vice versa! thisimes change
thoughts and mode of fashion.

423
01:07:54,842 --> 01:07:56,571
it doesn't alter a woman's body.

424
01:07:58,546 --> 01:08:02,141
People may consider woman like you,
very exciting...

425
01:08:02,750 --> 01:08:04,342
but nobody thinks you worthy
of any respect.

426
01:08:05,086 --> 01:08:10,888
Only those women are respected,
who are demure, and shy.

427
01:08:12,193 --> 01:08:14,024
i'm not asking you live
in shackles as a captive.

428
01:08:15,229 --> 01:08:20,690
but don't cross your limits either.
When a girls is at her parents place...

429
01:08:21,335 --> 01:08:24,532
she has but one burden on
her shoulders. Her family.

430
01:08:25,206 --> 01:08:32,078
but when she marries, she has, not
1 , but 2 burdens on her shoulders.

431
01:08:32,547 --> 01:08:37,314
thishe way you slapped. Nakul today.
What if he would've hit you back?

432
01:08:37,752 --> 01:08:40,186
Wouldn't it have been insulting?
Did you stop and think?

433
01:08:43,791 --> 01:08:44,780
What's the matter?

434
01:08:55,369 --> 01:08:58,998
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

435
01:08:59,707 --> 01:09:05,543
She said she couldn't cook.
i thought i'd set her straight.

436
01:09:05,980 --> 01:09:13,910
thishat made her cry. Why?
Don't i have the right to scold her?

437
01:09:14,755 --> 01:09:19,692
Why not? You're like a mother.
You can scold, hit. Do anything.

438
01:09:30,204 --> 01:09:34,800
i made a mistake in coming here.
thishey don't respect me at all.

439
01:09:35,810 --> 01:09:42,773
Everyone's always insulting me. i'm
crying and you're not even asking.

440
01:09:44,485 --> 01:09:46,214
You're crying for no reason.
So why bother to ask?

441
01:09:46,454 --> 01:09:49,548
So now i'm useless to you
and this household!

442
01:09:50,258 --> 01:09:52,783
You've become useless by staying
here with your family.

443
01:09:57,698 --> 01:10:04,228
A man's sneeze has some value,
but a frog's sneeze is ignored.

444
01:10:04,739 --> 01:10:07,902
Don't forget when a frog croaks,
gales and storms strike.

445
01:10:08,509 --> 01:10:11,069
When such a thing will happen,
you'll have to bear the consequences.

446
01:10:11,579 --> 01:10:16,642
Now i'll stay with you, only when
you stay with me at my father's!

447
01:10:27,428 --> 01:10:32,991
Meena is a very sweet girl,
but she's still childish.

448
01:10:34,502 --> 01:10:39,132
She doesn't know our customs,
but i'll teach her by and by.

449
01:10:46,981 --> 01:10:51,441
- brother she wishes to visit
her father. - She should too.

450
01:10:51,953 --> 01:10:55,320
it's nearly 6 months now.
She must be missing her own home.

451
01:10:55,790 --> 01:11:00,727
Your father-in-law had invited you
too. You also visit him this time.

452
01:11:02,663 --> 01:11:08,795
if she was coming back, l'd have
gone. but she's going forever.

453
01:11:10,871 --> 01:11:14,671
What are you saying?
if you both can't get along...

454
01:11:15,576 --> 01:11:19,478
should be solved within
the 4 walls of this house.

455
01:11:20,815 --> 01:11:25,081
She's a city-bred, educated girl
what does she know about our ways?

456
01:11:26,053 --> 01:11:30,513
it's your duty to teach her
our way of life, Arjun.

457
01:11:30,858 --> 01:11:37,127
it's no use she refuses to mix.
thishat's why i'm sending her.

458
01:11:37,465 --> 01:11:46,806
- i see. So you've already decided.
- thishe thing is, i told...

459
01:11:47,108 --> 01:11:51,704
You're very matured now.
So you should realize this too...

460
01:11:52,813 --> 01:11:57,147
that if she can't change herself,
then you change for her.

461
01:11:57,818 --> 01:12:01,618
She's your wife. it's your duty
to stand by her.

462
01:12:02,390 --> 01:12:05,382
After all she has trusted you
with her whole life.

463
01:12:07,662 --> 01:12:13,623
if you stumble at my door, and
feel pain, i'll cry with you.

464
01:12:14,201 --> 01:12:21,607
We're brothers. blood relations.
but a wife's relation is deeper.

465
01:12:22,310 --> 01:12:27,145
She comes from another family, but,
becomes the closest person. A shadow.

466
01:12:29,450 --> 01:12:35,946
if a man is body, a wife is soul.
She's the reason behind his success.

467
01:12:37,024 --> 01:12:41,256
Without a wife, a husband
becomes lifeless and disrespectful.

468
01:12:42,863 --> 01:12:50,269
if you leave her forever, then,
what will people think of me?

469
01:12:50,838 --> 01:12:58,438
Just think. A man who judges other
people's problems and given justice.

470
01:12:59,180 --> 01:13:00,943
if there's injustice in his own
home, people will laugh at me.

471
01:13:01,749 --> 01:13:03,717
i won't be able to show my face.

472
01:13:04,518 --> 01:13:08,818
i'm sorry. Please forgive me.

473
01:13:09,957 --> 01:13:13,654
- Go and get the property papers.
- Okay, sir.

474
01:13:15,262 --> 01:13:23,692
A wife is a husband's true strength.
Our ancestors describe a wife thus.

475
01:13:24,572 --> 01:13:28,838
A helper in her husband's work.
One who advises him correctly.

476
01:13:29,343 --> 01:13:33,370
Who serves him as his slave, and
feeds him like a mother.

477
01:13:34,115 --> 01:13:38,074
Looks like a Goddess, and has the
capacity to endure like the earth.

478
01:13:38,853 --> 01:13:40,548
thishat's an ideal wife.

479
01:13:41,822 --> 01:13:46,691
A woman's thoughts mould a man's
destiny. When she wants to...

480
01:13:47,528 --> 01:13:51,089
she turns a hut into a palace.
but when she wants to destroy...

481
01:13:51,832 --> 01:13:53,697
she turns a palace into
a mound of debris.

482
01:13:55,202 --> 01:13:56,169
Sir...

483
01:13:57,671 --> 01:14:05,043
thishese are our property papers.
How much Land we have...

484
01:14:05,646 --> 01:14:10,106
neither our father knew,
nor do we 3 brothers know.

485
01:14:11,419 --> 01:14:15,719
You're an educated girl. From
today, you be in charge of this.

486
01:14:16,290 --> 01:14:22,058
Give the house-keys,
with these papers to her.

487
01:14:30,204 --> 01:14:36,632
From today you own this house.
Wherever you ask 45 to sign...

488
01:14:36,911 --> 01:14:40,278
we 3 brothers will do so
without questioning you.

489
01:14:41,182 --> 01:14:43,673
We'll do, as you say.

490
01:14:45,953 --> 01:14:47,477
Just one request.

491
01:14:49,256 --> 01:14:55,752
Don't even think of separating
us 3 brothers.

492
01:15:09,743 --> 01:15:11,540
What a fine thing you did!

493
01:15:15,349 --> 01:15:21,686
i never dreamt of seeing him cry.
but you realized it for me.

494
01:15:22,690 --> 01:15:26,683
You really did a very nice thing!
Yes, truly a good thing!

495
01:15:47,915 --> 01:15:54,218
What happened, Meena?
Call a doctor. Hurry.

496
01:16:02,863 --> 01:16:05,491
No need to worry.
She'll be a mother soon.

497
01:16:33,861 --> 01:16:36,625
You people wait here.
i'll go and meet him.

498
01:16:45,306 --> 01:16:46,238
How are you, dear?

499
01:16:46,574 --> 01:16:49,008
What a pleasant surprise, but,
you didn't inform me you were coming.

500
01:17:00,621 --> 01:17:04,148
- My respects, Sir. - Yes, sir?
Why this sudden visit?

501
01:17:04,692 --> 01:17:07,058
Please sit down.

502
01:17:07,661 --> 01:17:13,657
l've never sat in your presence.
So how will i do so today?

503
01:17:14,568 --> 01:17:17,833
We're meeting after a long time.
How is your business?

504
01:17:18,539 --> 01:17:22,236
it's running well, with your grace.
And blessings, sir.

505
01:17:25,245 --> 01:17:29,341
- When is that appointment with
the minister? - 1 1 A.M tomorrow.

506
01:17:29,683 --> 01:17:33,312
- And the i.this. case? - Advocate
said it'll be over by 15th.

507
01:17:34,888 --> 01:17:38,289
- Will our exports be ready today
to sail to Japan? - Yes, Sir.

508
01:17:43,230 --> 01:17:45,755
Why did you take the trouble
to come here?

509
01:17:46,467 --> 01:17:50,096
l've spoken to the Governor about
you institution it'll be done.

510
01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:56,807
thishe Home Minister has promised that
your brother will be transferred.

511
01:18:03,851 --> 01:18:06,979
- Are you going some where?
- Yes. On some urgent work to Delhi.

512
01:18:13,293 --> 01:18:17,753
i had come near here to see some
land. thishought i'd meet you too.

513
01:18:18,666 --> 01:18:22,500
- i'll go now. - How can you?
Share some food with us at least.

514
01:18:22,970 --> 01:18:28,169
Sorry, but as a father, i can't
even drink water in my daughter's house.

515
01:18:28,676 --> 01:18:31,873
You still believe in all this,
after staying in the city?

516
01:18:32,680 --> 01:18:37,674
Whether i live in a city or village,
how can i forget our traditions?

517
01:18:38,585 --> 01:18:43,852
After all, i was born here.
Okay then, i'll go now.

518
01:18:44,258 --> 01:18:47,284
Meet your daughter and ask
how she's keeping?

519
01:18:47,761 --> 01:18:53,757
What are you saying? i'm not
so cheap as to ask about her...

520
01:18:54,535 --> 01:18:56,059
and insult you!

521
01:18:58,372 --> 01:19:06,074
it's my daughter's good luck that
she's wedded in this temple-like home.

522
01:19:07,214 --> 01:19:11,275
She must be well and happy
under your shelter and shadow.

523
01:19:12,953 --> 01:19:15,979
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

524
01:19:19,159 --> 01:19:27,328
My dear, just as you chirped in my
house, bring joy to this house too.

525
01:19:48,889 --> 01:19:54,555
You're older than me, so you
should know how to talk.

526
01:20:01,969 --> 01:20:06,167
- Please forgive me. - What's
wrong? - What are you doing?

527
01:20:06,807 --> 01:20:12,143
i'm repenting my folly.

528
01:20:12,412 --> 01:20:13,674

531
01:20:29,062 --> 01:20:32,657
- it'll affect the child, my dear.
- l've hurt and insulted you too.

532
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:37,969
You became my mother and
bore all my mistakes.

533
01:20:39,106 --> 01:20:44,373
And i couldn't be a daughter
to you. Please forgive me.

534
01:20:44,945 --> 01:20:48,210
Enough. When did i take
you so seriously anyway?

535
01:20:48,816 --> 01:20:50,613
Silly girl. Don't cry now.

536
01:21:07,134 --> 01:21:12,538
Lord, l've behaved like a petty
human with my divine in-laws.

537
01:21:13,273 --> 01:21:15,173
i encouraged hate.
Please give me guidance...

538
01:21:15,509 --> 01:21:18,034

heart for me.

541
01:21:44,171 --> 01:21:48,039

01:21:48,342 --> 01:21:50,776

01:27:52,558 --> 01:27:58,053
- Listen what did you tell him?

547
01:27:58,464 --> 01:28:03,163
- Oh? How much were you paid?
- Rs.10. i'll see a movie.

548
01:28:05,271 --> 01:28:08,468
i have a scope now!
Listen everybody...

549
01:28:17,616 --> 01:28:21,882
l've not heard, said or seen.
i'm the 3 wise monkeys.

550
01:28:22,188 --> 01:28:23,587
i know nothing, nothing nothing!

551
01:29:12,771 --> 01:29:16,673
Shameless woman! A teacher,
with such a cheap character?

552
01:29:17,743 --> 01:29:22,146
i'll have you thrown out today.
Pack your bags and be ready.

553
01:29:25,050 --> 01:29:30,386
i'm ruined!
thishat Arjun molested me.

554
01:29:33,225 --> 01:29:37,491
Will somebody hear my complain?
Give me justice?

555
01:29:38,063 --> 01:29:42,022
Why are you all silent?
Don't you believe me?

556
01:29:42,468 --> 01:29:46,029
Or are you scared to speak
and hear me?

557
01:29:46,539 --> 01:29:50,771
Look at this... and this.

558
01:29:53,479 --> 01:29:57,848
i beg you...
Please give me justice.

559
01:29:58,050 --> 01:29:59,779
Shut up you bitch!
Creating a scene, eh?

560
01:30:00,085 --> 01:30:05,682
You slut! thishe family you're out
to slur, is worshiped by us all.

561
01:30:07,927 --> 01:30:11,522
You, Madam?
What happened?

562
01:30:11,964 --> 01:30:16,901
- thishat Arjun... he...
- Molested you! i knew it.

563
01:30:17,202 --> 01:30:21,901
He was chasing you for days.
thisoday he caught you.

564
01:30:22,141 --> 01:30:24,234
You must've said no.
He must've persisted.

565
01:30:24,510 --> 01:30:28,412
You must've ran. He chased you
you must've refused, He laid you!

566
01:30:28,714 --> 01:30:34,710
Don't call me by my 1st name.
Respect me. i'm a thishakur too.

567
01:30:35,054 --> 01:30:39,320
Just because Dada thishakur is a big
landlord, his brother can't rape women.

568
01:30:39,625 --> 01:30:43,288
Shut up! You side this
Don't we know Arjun?

569
01:30:43,562 --> 01:30:48,659
if you say a word against him.
We'll cut you up right here!

570
01:30:48,901 --> 01:30:53,304
Why talk of cutting up?
i'll myself scoot from here.

571
01:30:54,239 --> 01:30:56,366
You head to hell,
i'll head home.

572
01:30:57,977 --> 01:31:04,212
She's slandering Arjun today.
thisomorrow, she'll sling mud at thishakur.

573
01:31:05,250 --> 01:31:09,778
Let's cut off her nose
and ears. Give me that!

574
01:31:11,490 --> 01:31:18,328
Stop! Listen carefully.
bury this matter right here.

575
01:31:18,731 --> 01:31:24,226
Don't let this reach Dada thishakur.
Else, hell be very hurt.

576
01:31:35,014 --> 01:31:40,247
Arjun is the cause
of my death!

577
01:31:41,854 --> 01:31:45,346
- How did this happen?
- i never thought she'd kill herself.

578
01:32:15,054 --> 01:32:18,751
See that, sir? thishat day when
i told you the truth...

579
01:32:19,091 --> 01:32:22,083
you had slapped me and
torn my ear-drums!

580
01:32:22,628 --> 01:32:26,394
And yesterday when she seeked
justice, from these people here...

581
01:32:26,598 --> 01:32:33,970
they abused her mostly foully
and chased her away.

582
01:32:35,174 --> 01:32:39,873
- Why did you do that?
- We thought she was lying.

583
01:32:40,245 --> 01:32:45,342
- thishat's why we chased her away.
- thishose who respect me, don't do this.

584
01:32:45,818 --> 01:32:49,618
- We made a mistake. Sorry.
- but justice will not err.

585
01:32:50,055 --> 01:32:56,392
Call the village court.
Justice will be done today. Now!

586
01:33:17,015 --> 01:33:26,822
Listen... i know...
You'll never be unjust to anyone.

587
01:33:28,093 --> 01:33:31,722
but my Arjun isn't guilty either.

588
01:33:33,532 --> 01:33:39,562
l've brought him up.
He's my son. He'll do no wrong.

589
01:33:40,539 --> 01:33:44,839
- He's my brother too.
- i'm not asking anything from you.

590
01:33:46,578 --> 01:33:53,142
but don't...
i know you won't be unjust.

591
01:33:53,485 --> 01:33:58,479
but Arjun isn't guilty either.
i don't want anything from you.

592
01:33:59,424 --> 01:34:01,517
i'm not asking anything.

593
01:34:06,398 --> 01:34:13,600
it's not proper for me to ask,
nor do i have the guts.

594
01:34:14,206 --> 01:34:17,937
You know my husband
better than i do.

595
01:34:20,045 --> 01:34:22,104
What more can i say?

596
01:34:25,918 --> 01:34:33,882
brother...
Nothing.

597
01:34:48,207 --> 01:34:52,507
thishose who give justice have
no relations, or emotions.

598
01:34:52,778 --> 01:34:55,474
One can lose life,
but never the pride.

599
01:34:56,515 --> 01:35:00,576
One who sacrificed life for justice
is the true judge.

600
01:35:00,919 --> 01:35:03,444
He touches the Zenith of justice!

601
01:35:03,822 --> 01:35:09,658
Shut up! Your crocodile-tears
will not move me.

602
01:35:10,195 --> 01:35:13,221
if you're guilty
you'll be punished.

603
01:35:13,599 --> 01:35:20,664
Sir, he has been accused falsely.
You know l've never done a bad deed.

604
01:35:21,039 --> 01:35:25,840
He's my brother.
We were born to the same mother.

605
01:35:28,614 --> 01:35:34,519
Ravana and Vibhishan were
brothers too. lt's not necessary...

606
01:35:34,820 --> 01:35:36,617
just because he's your brother,
he can do now wrong.

607
01:35:36,822 --> 01:35:40,314
- Sir, please forgive him.
- Pardoning the first time means...

608
01:35:40,626 --> 01:35:45,154
giving him a chance
to err yet again. Right?

609
01:35:45,430 --> 01:35:48,763
Yes sir. 100% correct. thishe
local-court will decide tomorrow.

610
01:35:50,102 --> 01:35:53,162
Sir, please give it
another thought.

611
01:35:54,673 --> 01:35:59,736
When i say it once, it means
i'll say it 100 times again.

612
01:36:12,190 --> 01:36:15,091
- Yes, Father? -You've to go
and approve the girl.

613
01:36:15,394 --> 01:36:19,296
- You've informed Manorama?
- Yes. thishey'll come there directly.

614
01:36:19,531 --> 01:36:24,298
- Father, we want to come too.
- Okay, we'll all go together.

615
01:36:50,395 --> 01:36:55,765
- How do you like the girl?
- Why ask her? She's lovely!

616
01:36:56,034 --> 01:36:59,299
i don't want your opinion,
brother-in-law, but my sister's.

617
01:36:59,972 --> 01:37:08,402
- How do you find her?
- i'll test her before i tell you.

618
01:37:09,815 --> 01:37:15,685
- Listen i didn't test you when
i came to see you. - How could you?

619
01:37:16,088 --> 01:37:18,750
My father didn't want you
as a son-in-law, anyway.

620
01:37:19,491 --> 01:37:22,051
it was only when you pleaded
and begged that he approved!

621
01:37:22,427 --> 01:37:23,917
Didn't test her, he says!

622
01:37:28,166 --> 01:37:31,829
You've to approve her.
thisest her thoroughly.

623
01:37:33,772 --> 01:37:36,036
i say...

624
01:37:37,209 --> 01:37:39,769
She's not deaf at least.

625
01:37:41,513 --> 01:37:44,004
Just stand up, will you?

626
01:37:48,854 --> 01:37:51,084
Now walk around a bit.

627
01:38:03,902 --> 01:38:05,631
thishat's fine.
Sit down please.

628
01:38:09,174 --> 01:38:13,133
She has good limbs too.
She's not cripple.

629
01:38:15,213 --> 01:38:23,279
- Yes? - How do you like her son?
- Whatever you and Aunt decide.

630
01:38:24,656 --> 01:38:28,888
We'll said, son! Now brother-in
-law, what do you have to say?

631
01:38:29,294 --> 01:38:34,061
Why are you embarrassing me?
What can i comment on this...

632
01:38:34,399 --> 01:38:41,703
divine work of act?
A Goddess! Fix it up now!

633
01:38:41,973 --> 01:38:46,535
- Not so fast. - What now?
One final test.

634
01:38:48,146 --> 01:38:49,943
Can you sing, my dear?

635
01:38:51,716 --> 01:38:58,713
- is this all necessary? - Quiet.
Let's check if she's a mute.

636
01:39:01,126 --> 01:39:03,754
Okay then.
Sing something for us.

637
01:39:06,431 --> 01:39:12,199
She's feeling shy. Okay then...
i'll sing first, and you sing later.

638
01:44:43,168 --> 01:44:45,329
Wow! thishat's more like it.

639
01:44:47,172 --> 01:44:49,834
Well! Well!

640
01:45:15,700 --> 01:45:19,067
- What are you doing? Let me go!
- i would if you weren't young.

641
01:45:19,370 --> 01:45:23,329
Now shut your trumpet!
Shut up, i say!

642
01:45:29,380 --> 01:45:33,840
Come one, come all.
Jaganath thishakur rapes a girl.

643
01:45:34,185 --> 01:45:36,847
thisomorrow, thishakur Saheb will give
his verdict in the local-court.

644
01:45:44,429 --> 01:45:49,867
- What is it?
- Greetings, Sir.

645
01:45:50,201 --> 01:45:55,605
- Sir, they've come to meet you.
- We had a fire in our hutments.

646
01:45:55,940 --> 01:45:59,933
- Everything is burnt to ashes.
- thishis is very sad indeed.

647
01:46:01,045 --> 01:46:05,744
Give them grain, clothes and
building material for homes.

648
01:46:06,284 --> 01:46:08,184
- thishank you, sir.
- Greetings, Sir.

649
01:46:09,120 --> 01:46:15,787
We've opened a school for poor.
We need your help.

650
01:46:16,294 --> 01:46:21,926
Very good! See that the kids
get lunch in school...

651
01:46:22,166 --> 01:46:25,294
and arrange for milk, books and
other thing. - thishank you, Sir.

652
01:46:31,309 --> 01:46:33,004
thishat's Manorama coming.

653
01:46:34,379 --> 01:46:37,678
- Yes, father? - Your Aunt's here.
Make arrangements for her to sit.

654
01:46:41,853 --> 01:46:46,984
- My respects, brother. - bless
you. - Hello, Aunt. - bless you.

655
01:46:47,625 --> 01:46:49,559
What's the matter?
You came in this sun?

656
01:46:51,296 --> 01:46:58,930
- brother...thishe local-court...
- i know.

657
01:47:01,539 --> 01:47:07,034
- thishe accused is my son.
- i know that too.

658
01:47:08,913 --> 01:47:14,374
You'll be giving the verdict.
You're not my real brother...

659
01:47:14,619 --> 01:47:20,683
yet you reared me as a real
sister. You got me married...

660
01:47:20,992 --> 01:47:29,331
you became my mother and
saw to my every happiness.

661
01:47:30,735 --> 01:47:36,435
thisoday, all that joy,
depends on your verdict.

662
01:47:37,709 --> 01:47:41,543
My son is still childish.
He doesn't know good from the bad.

663
01:47:42,213 --> 01:47:46,115
thisaking his childishness and
immaturity into consideration...

664
01:47:46,417 --> 01:47:50,114
if you can forgive him
this one, then i...

665
01:48:00,198 --> 01:48:06,626
Son, whatever gold we have in
our safe, give it to your Aunt.

666
01:48:08,840 --> 01:48:14,904
Look, i'll give you
a mango-orchard.

667
01:48:15,680 --> 01:48:22,711
Also, 200 acres of fertile land.
And not just this...

668
01:48:23,087 --> 01:48:28,218
Even if you ask for my life,
i'll give you that too.

669
01:48:28,993 --> 01:48:37,662
but we cannot bend the rules
which we've honored for centuries!

670
01:48:38,536 --> 01:48:41,369
but, if you want, you can...

671
01:48:46,611 --> 01:48:52,345
i knew you wouldn't budge
from your principles and pride.

672
01:48:53,384 --> 01:48:59,345
i had come to console myself,
that if i request you personally...

673
01:48:59,791 --> 01:49:07,857
you may change your verdict.
A mother is selfish about her kids.

674
01:49:09,901 --> 01:49:14,065
if l've erred anywhere,
then forgive me, dear brother.

675
01:49:23,114 --> 01:49:32,512
i'm not bitter. in fact i'm proud
to be a sister of such a just man.

676
01:49:33,458 --> 01:49:35,619
bless you.

677
01:49:47,805 --> 01:49:50,797
Get the buggy ready.
Ramu the thishakur is leaving soon.

678
01:49:58,950 --> 01:50:03,148
thishis is from babuji and...
Hey! Where are you going?

679
01:50:03,788 --> 01:50:05,847
And this is from me.

680
01:50:17,034 --> 01:50:22,563
- My respects. - bless you, dear.
- it makes me so very happy...

681
01:50:22,940 --> 01:50:25,238
to see you give love to them.
No sister-in-law does this.

682
01:50:25,910 --> 01:50:32,713
- thishey're like sons to me.
- Wonderful! May you be happy.

683
01:50:33,351 --> 01:50:37,981
Son i'm very lucky to get
such a daughter-in-law.

684
01:50:38,556 --> 01:50:44,222
Remember one thing, always eat
curds and sugar from her hands.

685
01:50:44,662 --> 01:50:46,391
- it's lucky.
- Yes, Father. - Let's go.

686
01:50:55,673 --> 01:50:58,164
- thisata, father.
- Shall we go, Father? - Yes.

687
01:51:15,760 --> 01:51:17,751
Stop! Stop.

688
01:51:21,032 --> 01:51:27,904
No matter how big a man is,
he's humble at his sister's door.

689
01:51:28,606 --> 01:51:33,634
- Come in and have something.
- i'm not a brother right now.

690
01:51:34,111 --> 01:51:36,875
but a judge of a local-court.
Have you forgotten that...

691
01:51:37,315 --> 01:51:43,345
i don't even drink water from
the house which is involved.

692
01:51:43,921 --> 01:51:48,688
Let the verdict be given,...
we'll all sit together and eat.

693
01:51:48,993 --> 01:51:55,330
be careful with the verdict.
He's your sister's son too.

694
01:51:55,800 --> 01:52:00,260
if the verdict is wrong,
the outcome will be very bad.

695
01:52:04,342 --> 01:52:05,775
Let's go, son.

696
01:53:26,090 --> 01:53:32,620
My daughter was bringing
firewood. And this man raped her.

697
01:53:33,130 --> 01:53:38,432
Her honor is most valuable to us.
Who'll wed her now?

698
01:53:40,938 --> 01:53:44,601
You're the chief justice.
You give us your verdict.

699
01:53:53,150 --> 01:53:57,416
- Any eye-witnesses?
- i saw it all, sir.

700
01:53:59,056 --> 01:54:03,288
- Are you related to the girl?
- Yes. i'm her Aunt.

701
01:54:04,095 --> 01:54:05,653
thishen your statement
cannot be considered.

702
01:54:08,833 --> 01:54:13,566
A person who has seen the crime
and is not related to the girl...

703
01:54:13,838 --> 01:54:16,568
will be heard.

704
01:54:18,542 --> 01:54:20,476
ls there any witness like that?

705
01:54:39,497 --> 01:54:41,226
Yes there is, sir.

706
01:54:44,135 --> 01:54:47,866
- i saw it all.
- What did you. See, son?

707
01:54:48,406 --> 01:54:53,400
i saw him take her on his
shoulder forcibly into the shed...

708
01:54:53,644 --> 01:54:56,807
and then shut the door.

709
01:54:59,016 --> 01:55:03,919
She was yelling ''Help'', but,
there was nobody around...

710
01:55:09,193 --> 01:55:13,527
When she came out later on,
her clothes were torn...

711
01:55:14,098 --> 01:55:17,659
and she was crying,
saying ''i'm ruined.''

712
01:55:24,542 --> 01:55:29,309
You damn cur! What do you
think these poor are?

713
01:55:30,781 --> 01:55:35,741
thishese are the laborers whose
toil and sweat maintain the corps.

714
01:55:36,320 --> 01:55:39,346
We owe our land lordship
to these poor people!

715
01:55:39,824 --> 01:55:42,884
And in exchange they get fed
2 a day and a sheet to cover them.

716
01:55:43,260 --> 01:55:46,559
And you dared to force yourself
in that sheet and raped her?

717
01:55:47,031 --> 01:55:51,627
You're no better than an animal!
Get some +vermillion' from the temple.

718
01:55:53,170 --> 01:56:00,667
Come forward, girl.
thishe hands that raped you...

719
01:56:00,945 --> 01:56:04,972
will put vermillion in your hair
and wed you! You'll be his wife.

720
01:56:05,416 --> 01:56:06,849
thishat's why verdict.

721
01:56:07,985 --> 01:56:10,852
Change your verdict, i say!

722
01:56:15,092 --> 01:56:20,860
Don't spit fire at me! thishis lowly
girl, whose feet would soil my floor...

723
01:56:21,065 --> 01:56:25,229
... she'll be my daughter-in-law?

724
01:56:27,605 --> 01:56:31,041
Don't you know this is a common
thing surround here?

725
01:56:31,675 --> 01:56:37,079
Landlords and peasant women are
always involved. Nobody weds them.

726
01:56:37,548 --> 01:56:42,611
Silence! Landlords don't own these
girls to play around with them!

727
01:56:43,154 --> 01:56:51,892
A girl's virginity is precious.
Whether she's rich, or poor.

728
01:56:52,263 --> 01:56:55,460
Have you gone crazy?
You're not fit to give justice.

729
01:56:56,267 --> 01:56:58,462
You'll pay heavily for this.

730
01:57:07,645 --> 01:57:10,307
One more word,
and i'll have your tongue!

731
01:57:10,915 --> 01:57:15,284
You're not worthy to stand before
me and yet you challenge me?

732
01:57:16,854 --> 01:57:20,847
l've never bothered with outcomes.
if i have bothered...

733
01:57:21,158 --> 01:57:24,958
it was only about pride,
justice and faith.

734
01:57:34,138 --> 01:57:35,799
Jaganath put vermillion on her!

735
01:58:16,413 --> 01:58:23,444
bless you. if you trouble her,
you'll have to answer to me.

736
01:58:25,990 --> 01:58:53,012
Long live the thishakur.

737
01:59:08,832 --> 01:59:17,501
No! You'll not widow
your own Aunt, son.

738
01:59:18,342 --> 01:59:19,434
Father!

739
01:59:22,613 --> 01:59:25,309
Dear brother...

740
01:59:25,716 --> 01:59:29,277
He shot my brother.
He killed my noble brother.

741
01:59:29,987 --> 01:59:32,820
Why did you do this?
What a catastrophe!

742
01:59:42,566 --> 01:59:45,592
Stop! Let him be.

743
01:59:49,573 --> 01:59:53,566
He'll be punished for
the crime he has committed.

744
01:59:55,446 --> 02:00:02,147
From today, for 18 long years,
i declare this man an outcast!

745
02:00:06,223 --> 02:00:11,786
if anybody keeps any relation
with him and his family...

746
02:00:12,629 --> 02:00:14,722
... he'll be an out cast too!

747
02:00:16,166 --> 02:00:20,432
thishis is my verdict.

748
02:00:30,547 --> 02:00:37,885
thishose who give justice,
have no relations or emotions.

749
02:00:38,889 --> 02:00:43,519
One may lose one's life,
but never one's pride.

750
02:00:44,795 --> 02:00:49,789
He who protects honor with his
life, is a true judge.

751
02:00:50,300 --> 02:00:52,632
He touches the Zenith of justice

752
02:01:01,745 --> 02:01:09,208
From today i hand over the
chair of justice to you.

753
02:01:12,256 --> 02:01:24,361
Remember, if you ever give wrong
verdict, it'll be your last day.

754
02:02:35,372 --> 02:02:40,071
Does anybody wish to say anything.
- Nobody need say anything.

755
02:02:42,446 --> 02:02:45,711
thishe teacher's suicide proves that
she was raped.

756
02:02:47,317 --> 02:02:49,148
And the cause of it
is Arjun thishakur.

757
02:02:50,721 --> 02:02:55,488
And for that, Arjun is declared
an outcast for next 12 years.

758
02:03:00,898 --> 02:03:06,859
Nobody shall talk to him,
or help. if anybody does so...

759
02:03:07,137 --> 02:03:10,800
he and his family will suffer
the same end.

760
02:03:12,309 --> 02:03:16,211
thishat innocent girl was a support
to her widowed mother.

761
02:03:17,347 --> 02:03:20,612
50% of Arjun thishakur's estate
will be given to her mother.

762
02:03:21,852 --> 02:03:23,251
thishis is my verdict.

763
02:03:30,427 --> 02:03:33,396
Here are the keys
to the farm house.

764
02:03:42,773 --> 02:03:43,762
We're leaving...

765
02:03:51,715 --> 02:03:53,683
We're going, sister-in-law.

766
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:46,800
Why did you do this?
i know you're innocent.

767
02:04:48,939 --> 02:04:53,876
You were never involved with her
and neither have you killed her.

768
02:04:55,212 --> 02:04:58,409
thishen why didn't you tell
your brother in the court?

769
02:04:58,682 --> 02:05:07,249
He didn't ask, i didn't tell
l've done what he told me to.

770
02:05:08,392 --> 02:05:13,420
l've replied only to what
he asked. You don't know it...

771
02:05:14,031 --> 02:05:17,228
but my brother and his
wife are God to me.

772
02:05:18,402 --> 02:05:22,532
thishey've brought up Nakul
and i like their won kids.

773
02:05:24,508 --> 02:05:30,879
thisheir ultimate sacrifice is,
that they've refused to have kids.

774
02:05:33,784 --> 02:05:38,244
i don't believe in such things,
and i'm in no hurry to have a kid.

775
02:05:39,256 --> 02:05:42,919
You're childless for all these
years, you tie them if you wish.

776
02:05:48,198 --> 02:05:54,068
- What is it? Why are you crying?
- i'm crying at my own misfortune.

777
02:05:55,205 --> 02:06:00,768
Due to my immaturity l've
insulted them both very badly.

778
02:06:02,312 --> 02:06:03,609
l've hurt them.

779
02:06:20,097 --> 02:06:24,033
Pray that God keeps you, and,
shows you the correct path.

780
02:06:24,735 --> 02:06:31,868
i don't want happiness, Mother.
i want that strength from God...

781
02:06:32,142 --> 02:06:36,977
which will in able me to ruin.
Dada thishakur's family.

782
02:06:37,414 --> 02:06:42,249
Don't say that. God doesn't
listen to such evil prayers.

783
02:06:42,519 --> 02:06:46,546
but he's listening to me.
thishe day i came back...

784
02:06:46,790 --> 02:06:53,923
from 18 long years of exile,
he sent his own brother into one!

785
02:06:55,332 --> 02:07:03,762
thishis is a good beginning.
Now see how terrible his end will be!

786
02:07:08,178 --> 02:07:11,636
Dear Lord, will he never learn?

787
02:07:45,448 --> 02:07:48,246
- How do you like her?
- very beautiful.

788
02:07:49,486 --> 02:07:55,425
- thishen shall i proceed further?
- Pronto! thisoday i really respect you.**

789
02:07:55,625 --> 02:07:56,956
but from today onwards...

790
02:07:59,262 --> 02:08:04,256
Call the girl's mother.
Let's discuss the dowry too.

791
02:08:06,069 --> 02:08:07,058
Chandni, my dear...

792
02:08:47,544 --> 02:08:50,980
- What's the matter, dear?
- You're so cruel!

793
02:08:51,014 --> 02:08:59,114
You left me holding an infant girl.
And today l met you after 18 years!

794
02:08:59,556 --> 02:09:04,755
Why did you play with my love?
Why make me an unwed mom?

795
02:09:06,529 --> 02:09:11,865
Forgive me, dear. i was helpless.
My conditions were unfavorable.

796
02:09:12,335 --> 02:09:18,035
Else, which rascal will discard
a hot and sweet dish like you?

797
02:09:18,441 --> 02:09:26,439
i was all alone after you left.
And a lonely woman is ogled at.

798
02:09:26,816 --> 02:09:33,449
thishat's why l've kept him with me.
He's my rented husband!

799
02:09:33,857 --> 02:09:41,127
- What! - Yes.
And this is our daughter. - Daddy!

800
02:09:42,499 --> 02:09:47,732
Daughter! Wife!
thishere he goes with his kissing...

801
02:09:48,605 --> 02:09:54,168
- Hey you!
- thishis is my son, Gora.

802
02:09:54,511 --> 02:09:59,005
- Son? Come and hug me, son.
- Keep away...

803
02:09:59,215 --> 02:10:06,053
Let me explain. thishis is your sis.
And she's your step-mom, No.33.

804
02:10:06,389 --> 02:10:12,919
You rogue. thisill now you showed
only cripple, deaf and mute girls.

805
02:10:13,163 --> 02:10:16,564
thisoday i found someone better,
and you made her my sister?

806
02:10:16,967 --> 02:10:18,594
i won't spare you now!

807
02:10:19,469 --> 02:10:23,337
- brother! - i was going to be
your lover, but i became a brother.

808
02:10:24,941 --> 02:10:27,341
He's eating like an Ox!

809
02:10:32,515 --> 02:10:36,884
Wait, dear husband.
Where are you going?

810
02:10:37,320 --> 02:10:42,917
Let me go, my dear.
thishis rented hubby is fine for you.

811
02:10:43,193 --> 02:10:49,894
- No! - but i promise to meet
you in my next birth as sweet 16.

812
02:10:50,266 --> 02:10:52,359
- Nice and fresh.
- No!

813
02:11:11,354 --> 02:11:18,192
thisoday is a good day for harvesting
if you let me, i'll ask them to begin.

814
02:11:26,903 --> 02:11:31,567
From today Nakul will
manage Arjun's work.

815
02:11:32,108 --> 02:11:34,042
- be with him and help him.
- Yes, sir.

816
02:11:51,294 --> 02:11:55,924
Hey! What are you doing?
Give that to me.

817
02:11:56,232 --> 02:12:00,259
- thishis is a woman's job. - i know.
but now when he's pregnant.

818
02:12:00,570 --> 02:12:05,030
- i'm going to be a mother. i'm
not a patient. - thishat's just it.

819
02:12:05,241 --> 02:12:09,769
You'll not do any work from today.
i'll do it. You be happy.

820
02:12:09,913 --> 02:12:12,040
it'll affect the baby, you see.
Understand? Now give me that.

821
02:12:12,248 --> 02:12:14,045
- No! - Give, i say.
- What are you doing? Give!

822
02:12:14,384 --> 02:12:16,682
- Are you mad? - Yes i am.
Now give me that...

823
02:12:21,324 --> 02:12:23,053
i'll relay, while you sit here.

824
02:12:33,603 --> 02:12:40,873
Listen. May i say something?
Meena is pregnant.

825
02:12:42,345 --> 02:12:49,877
Our heir will be born. She'll need
a mother or a mother-in-law now.

826
02:12:51,454 --> 02:12:55,356
Somebody who can understand her
difficulties. Who can console her.

827
02:12:56,159 --> 02:13:03,224
Who can give her moral strength.
thishat joy wasn't in my lot.

828
02:13:03,500 --> 02:13:14,001
i just want to met her and
present her with bangles.

829
02:13:18,214 --> 02:13:31,753
i know you won't break the rule.
but if you wish, it can be done.

830
02:13:33,563 --> 02:13:41,402
No! thishe rule is not just for the
surrounding villages, but us too.

831
02:13:42,305 --> 02:13:43,602
You can't meet her.

832
02:13:45,909 --> 02:13:49,811
Can't your verdict bend a little?

833
02:13:50,580 --> 02:13:55,347
All the courts allow the prisoners
to meet their relatives.

834
02:13:55,985 --> 02:14:01,287
but once your court brands a man
as a criminal, he can't meet anyone.

835
02:14:01,958 --> 02:14:08,056
in Govt.Courts, a man has a right
to appeal if he loses the case.

836
02:14:08,464 --> 02:14:13,060
but your court, it starts,
and ends, with you!

837
02:14:13,536 --> 02:14:15,800
No appeal, no acquittal
no solution.

838
02:14:17,207 --> 02:14:24,204
Your court has discarded a mother's
heart by out casting Arjun.

839
02:14:25,882 --> 02:14:30,342
Everybody is doing their duty.
You're doing yours.

840
02:14:30,787 --> 02:14:38,455
Meena did hers by following Arjun.
but what am i supposed to do?

841
02:14:38,761 --> 02:14:44,859
thisell me! thiso your local-court,
you're an angel of justice.

842
02:14:45,168 --> 02:14:49,571
but you're a criminal
in the eyes of a mother.

843
02:14:49,806 --> 02:14:52,297
My love for my Arjun,
will never forgive you.

844
02:14:52,609 --> 02:14:59,481
Giving verdict is very easy,
but to bear the punishment isn't!

845
02:14:59,949 --> 02:15:04,545
i'll insult your justice.
i don't agree with your verdict.

846
02:15:17,667 --> 02:15:20,500
- My respects...
- Mine too.

847
02:15:20,803 --> 02:15:26,002
- How are you? - Alright.
- l've come to take you away.

848
02:15:26,376 --> 02:15:32,781
it's her 1st baby i wish to
announce it in grand style.

849
02:15:34,183 --> 02:15:40,486
- but what about brother?
- Nobody can object my decision.

850
02:20:41,991 --> 02:20:45,324
i don't accept it!
i don't! No, i don't!

851
02:20:56,872 --> 02:21:03,436
Lord, forgive me. How did i
even think of insulting him?

852
02:21:04,380 --> 02:21:09,579
i spoke utter nonsense!
Don't let such thoughts come to me.

853
02:21:10,019 --> 02:21:11,452
Please forgive me.

854
02:21:41,951 --> 02:21:42,849
Stop!

855
02:21:45,554 --> 02:21:50,719
We're out casts at present.
thisalking to us, or even helping us...

856
02:21:51,060 --> 02:21:54,029
is a crime in the eyes
of the local-courts.

857
02:21:54,697 --> 02:22:00,863
i know dear. but l've some
duties as a father too.

858
02:22:02,071 --> 02:22:06,770
We've an old. thisradition, that
when the daughter gets pregnant...

859
02:22:07,376 --> 02:22:14,805
her parents bless her.
i couldn't stop myself from coming.

860
02:22:16,252 --> 02:22:21,053
Forgive me.
but the family i belong to now.

861
02:22:21,323 --> 02:22:25,419
i can't break its order,
and accept your blessings.

862
02:22:26,529 --> 02:22:30,966
thisoday, you've become taller
than even me, my dear.

863
02:22:32,635 --> 02:22:41,771
i must've done something good
to deserve a daughter like you.

864
02:22:42,845 --> 02:22:44,437
be hearty.
bye-bye.

865
02:22:57,927 --> 02:23:00,395
bless me, brother.

866
02:23:14,176 --> 02:23:17,236
Listen.
She wants something from you.

867
02:23:30,292 --> 02:23:37,095
thishese bangles are enough for me.
One day, for my happiness...

868
02:23:37,800 --> 02:23:45,730
you had tied these bangles here.
thishrough them you both've blessed me.

869
02:24:06,695 --> 02:24:10,597
You shameless girl!
You love him, eh?

870
02:24:11,066 --> 02:24:15,560
i'll kill you! Chop you to pieces.
Come on, into your room now!

871
02:24:16,272 --> 02:24:20,231
What are you doing?
Leave her alone.

872
02:24:20,442 --> 02:24:23,502
Get aside!
You too.

873
02:24:23,979 --> 02:24:27,745
Have you gone mad? Why are you
hitting here? - thishis wretched girl...

874
02:24:27,983 --> 02:24:30,110
is involved with Nakul.

875
02:24:30,452 --> 02:24:33,888
in such a huge country she found
only that house to give her heart?

876
02:24:34,089 --> 02:24:40,085
So what? thishey're related to us.
And if we unite because of her...

877
02:24:40,329 --> 02:24:42,229
what can be better than that?

878
02:24:42,665 --> 02:24:48,035
You're siding her? As long as
this can never be possible.

879
02:24:48,370 --> 02:24:52,704
She'll marry where i want her to!
Come along!

880
02:24:52,942 --> 02:24:56,935
Get inside!
Falls in love, eh!

881
02:24:57,179 --> 02:25:00,307
- i'll show you yet!
- Don't do this to her, son.

882
02:25:00,616 --> 02:25:02,811
Get aside you old hag!
She won't step out of the house!

883
02:25:03,085 --> 02:25:06,714
i'll go to the city with her,
and get her married tomorrow!

884
02:25:30,212 --> 02:25:36,117
- Grandma! - My dear child!
Don't cry, my dear.

885
02:25:38,821 --> 02:25:45,920
You mother and l, have spent
our whole lives under his thumb.

886
02:25:46,962 --> 02:25:50,523
i'll see that, you're spread.

887
02:25:50,966 --> 02:25:55,460
- You'll marry your Nakul.
- Wow! - Yes, my dear.

888
02:25:55,971 --> 02:26:01,967
Go! Go to him and marry him.
i'll face the music here.

889
02:26:02,578 --> 02:26:03,772
Oh Grandma!

890
02:26:05,848 --> 02:26:07,247
Come with me.

891
02:26:23,165 --> 02:26:27,465
- Where has Sangita gone?
- Where she should have!

892
02:26:28,804 --> 02:26:33,207
- Meaning you helped her escape?
- Yes...

893
02:26:33,475 --> 02:26:36,000
You where!
A worthless woman!

894
02:26:36,245 --> 02:26:41,308
Don't ever say that again!
if i was really worthless...

895
02:26:41,617 --> 02:26:48,989
you wouldn't have wanted me!
You wouldn't have made me pregnant.

896
02:26:49,792 --> 02:26:55,628
- So you have a tongue after all.
- Yes! l've had enough now.

897
02:26:56,098 --> 02:26:58,658
if l endure any more,
it'll be an insult to womanhood!

898
02:26:59,134 --> 02:27:03,662
it's my duty to respect you,
but i needn't bear your tyranny!

899
02:27:03,973 --> 02:27:06,669
You talk of endurance?

900
02:27:07,076 --> 02:27:12,104
i'll kill you! Chop you up!

901
02:27:13,816 --> 02:27:18,617
- Why are you beating her?
- She helped Sangita to escape.

902
02:27:18,921 --> 02:27:22,789
i helped Sangita to run away!
Abuse me! Punish me!

903
02:27:23,158 --> 02:27:32,191
You helped her to run away?
i'll also see how she marries Nakul.

904
02:27:37,773 --> 02:27:42,403
You may be the Head of this village
but you're my foe, remember.

905
02:27:44,980 --> 02:27:54,287
You still burn inside with enmity.
thishat's why you're hiding my daughter.

906
02:27:55,891 --> 02:28:03,229
How can you be a Headman?
Your Arjun was exposed publicly.

907
02:28:03,665 --> 02:28:09,433
You're a worse criminal than him!
Why are you hiding inside?

908
02:28:09,738 --> 02:28:10,796
Come on out!

909
02:28:33,862 --> 02:28:43,703
She came here last night.
You were in a deep sleep.

910
02:28:44,573 --> 02:28:50,637
i didn't dare to wake you.
i didn't know what to do.

911
02:28:51,814 --> 02:29:00,222
it was her reputation at stake.
And she isn't a stranger.

912
02:29:00,889 --> 02:29:06,555
thishat's why i let her stay here.
thishought i'd tell you in the morning.

913
02:29:08,530 --> 02:29:12,398
i was wrong.
Forgive me.

914
02:29:13,001 --> 02:29:16,903
i brought her up with lots of love
for the past 18 years.

915
02:29:17,239 --> 02:29:21,699
And you want to destroy it?

916
02:29:22,077 --> 02:29:26,537
One brother molested the teacher
and killed her!

917
02:29:26,915 --> 02:29:31,443
And now your other brother wants
to prey on my innocent kid?

918
02:29:31,787 --> 02:29:34,551
i'll never allow it!

919
02:29:35,724 --> 02:29:38,659
Sangita, go to your father.

920
02:29:40,262 --> 02:29:46,826
- Please don't send me to him.
i beg you. - What nonsense!

921
02:29:47,136 --> 02:29:50,936
He's right. He's your father.
You'll have to go to him.

922
02:29:51,173 --> 02:29:53,505
- No! but i...
- You heard me.

923
02:30:06,555 --> 02:30:10,787
You thought you'd run away,
and i'd keep quiet?

924
02:30:11,260 --> 02:30:14,923
Didn't you think about your family?
You went on your own to marry?

925
02:30:15,397 --> 02:30:21,302
i'll get you married wherever,
and to whoever i want to! - No!

926
02:30:21,470 --> 02:30:24,496
- i won't marry! - Come on!
- i'll marry the one i love.

927
02:30:24,773 --> 02:30:28,174
i won't wed according to your wish.
i'll marry where i want to!

928
02:30:28,610 --> 02:30:31,306
Or, really?

929
02:30:31,547 --> 02:30:36,007
Stop it! Aren't you ashamed to
lift your hand on a young daughter?

930
02:30:39,321 --> 02:30:40,788
Whom do you wish to marry?

931
02:30:48,764 --> 02:30:55,932
Put your arm down, else i'll cut
it. i'll decide whom you'll marry.

932
02:30:56,205 --> 02:31:00,073
Otherwise i'll throttle you!

933
02:31:00,275 --> 02:31:06,646
Don't talk like a fool.
She has a right to choose her groom.

934
02:31:07,282 --> 02:31:13,846
Stop this farce and go home!
She's not your daughter anymore.

935
02:31:14,056 --> 02:31:17,787
She's our future daughter in law.
i'll come with the proposal soon.

936
02:31:18,060 --> 02:31:20,187
i spit on your proposal,
and this damn house!

937
02:31:20,462 --> 02:31:25,900
i'll get her married to a cripple.
but not your brother, you rascal!

938
02:31:27,736 --> 02:31:33,231
- Show him come respect. - if you
abuse him, we'll cut your tongue.

939
02:31:33,809 --> 02:31:43,116
Stop! After Holi this girl
will wed my brother Nakul.

940
02:31:43,585 --> 02:31:45,109
thishat's my final word.

941
02:32:13,315 --> 02:32:20,278
After Holi this girl will
wed Nakul. thishat's my final word.

942
02:32:21,189 --> 02:32:32,191
Dada thishakur keeps his word.
He'll get Sangita and Nakul married.

943
02:32:34,336 --> 02:32:37,863
thishat rascal will dare to wed
my Sangita to that Nakul?

944
02:32:38,106 --> 02:32:43,669
He doesn't know my evil ways.
i'm not a fool like my father.

945
02:32:43,879 --> 02:32:47,337
thiso shoot from the front and then
get punished for it!

946
02:32:47,749 --> 02:32:55,781
i'll kill him very shrewdly.
Like i killed the teacher...

947
02:32:56,091 --> 02:33:00,755
and got Arjun blamed
and ostracized!

948
02:33:02,097 --> 02:33:07,057
- You mean you killed the teacher?
- Yes!

949
02:33:07,803 --> 02:33:11,239
i had sent that teacher
to trap Arjun.

950
02:33:11,640 --> 02:33:16,407
but she couldn't,
so she came to me.

951
02:33:17,179 --> 02:33:24,085
Forgive me, but i tried my best to
trap him but nobody believed me.

952
02:33:24,519 --> 02:33:29,149
- People are out to kill me!
- Shut up you worthless teacher!

953
02:33:29,558 --> 02:33:33,016
You couldn't lure him in 2 months!
on your sensuality.

954
02:33:33,261 --> 02:33:41,635
if my father hadn't taken a loan
from you, i'd have never done this.

955
02:33:42,537 --> 02:33:47,600
People worship that family like
a deity. And he is a noble man.

956
02:33:48,343 --> 02:33:54,077
i'll pay you back somehow.
but for now, send me back.

957
02:33:54,583 --> 02:34:00,852
Since you're of no use,
it's better i pack you off!

958
02:34:39,795 --> 02:34:47,930
thishis way that Dada thishakur
was forced to outcast Arjun!

959
02:34:48,470 --> 02:34:56,673
And now, tomorrow, i get rid of
Dada thishakur and that Nakul.

960
02:34:57,078 --> 02:35:00,741
And make it look like
''death to stick-wielding game'' !

961
02:35:01,216 --> 02:35:07,018
Rascal! You got that simple Arjun
punished for you own deeds?

962
02:35:07,422 --> 02:35:13,327
You separated those noble brother?
i'll never forgive you!

963
02:35:13,695 --> 02:35:19,634
- Don't talk to much, else you'll
plant. - i didn't pant when...

964
02:35:19,935 --> 02:35:25,999
i gave birth to a devil like you.
i'll tell everything to Dada thishakur.

965
02:35:26,274 --> 02:35:33,680
Mother! You won't step out, till
i bathe that man in his own gore.

966
02:35:33,882 --> 02:35:36,316
Get inside! Come on...
Shut the door.

967
02:35:43,592 --> 02:35:49,588
thishis is our house. but for now,
we'll enjoy our honeymoon till morn.

968
02:35:52,234 --> 02:35:59,037
- Who's this? - Can't you see?
My wife. Your daughter-in-law.

969
02:35:59,274 --> 02:36:04,678
My foot! Why did you marry
without informing me?

970
02:36:04,946 --> 02:36:09,883
because you're dead to me.
Fallen in my eyes! - You damn...

971
02:36:10,151 --> 02:36:11,743
Don't yell!

972
02:36:14,055 --> 02:36:17,957
Okay. What's done, is done.
Now come and seek my blessing.

973
02:36:18,326 --> 02:36:21,523
Get lost! i don't want to be
blessed by a rascal like you...

974
02:36:21,730 --> 02:36:25,632
and spoil my newly married
life. - What are you saying?

975
02:36:26,001 --> 02:36:29,402
He's my father-in-law,
We must take his blessings.

976
02:36:30,972 --> 02:36:34,169
Okay, carry on.
i don't want it.

977
02:36:35,710 --> 02:36:40,238
And listen keep your distance.
Don't touch him.

978
02:36:45,053 --> 02:36:47,521
Let me go, father-in-law.
What are you doing?

979
02:36:47,756 --> 02:36:50,554
- blessing you, my dear.
- Let go! Let me go!

980
02:36:50,792 --> 02:36:54,319
Let her go, damn you!
What aware you doing to her?

981
02:36:54,629 --> 02:36:56,790
She's my daughter-in-law,
so i was just hugging her.

982
02:36:56,998 --> 02:37:01,298
Hugging her or embracing her?
Rascal! i know your intentions.

983
02:37:01,503 --> 02:37:03,027
- Get out of here!
- You son of a mom...

984
02:37:15,717 --> 02:37:18,515
- is it you, Mangala?
- How are you?

985
02:37:18,787 --> 02:37:27,388
- i'm fine, but where did you go?
- Getting fed up of your ways...

991
02:38:03,598 --> 02:38:06,658

He wasn't my child,
but cancer!

He killed that teacher, and
had Arjun ostracized. He!

1011

And poor Arjun got punished.

1012

You were unjust, Dharmaraj.
You gave a wrong verdict!

1013
02:49:27,181 --> 02:49:31,311
What are you doing, Aunt?
Don't accuse him falsely.
