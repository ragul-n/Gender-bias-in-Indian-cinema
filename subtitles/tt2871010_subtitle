1
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:37,580
I can't do this, Mom.

2
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:39,170
Be brave my child.

3
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:44,670
Keep praying.
"Satnaam Vahe Guru Satnaam Vaahe Guru."

4
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:51,460
"Satnaam Vahe Guru
Satnaam Vaahe Guru."

5
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:56,040
Oh well...

6
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:57,710
Thank you.

7
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:03,540
Yes, I am send them.

8
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:20,960
"Satnaam Vahe Guru
Satnaam Vaahe Guru."

9
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:06,830
Hey, Sonali!
What the hell are you upto?

10
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,380
Do we ever go offline?

11
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:12,210
Sonali, are you nuts?

12
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:13,580
Don't do it...
You mad.

13
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:17,540
Sonali...

14
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,080
Oh my God...

15
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:33,500
Thank you Lord Ganesha.

16
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,460
The keys are right here.
Can't you wait a bit?

17
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,960
I can wait. The baby can't!

18
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,460
Thank God!

19
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:15,880
"We are crazy...
..and carefree."

20
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:22,790
"We are silly...
..we are naughty."

21
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:25,750
"We travel in style."

22
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:29,040
"We make noise."

23
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:36,960
"We fix everyone...
..broken dreams."

24
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:43,710
"We are combustible...
..and young."

25
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:49,710
"Totally stubborn...
..our dreams, our dreams."

26
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:51,670
Greetings, brother Bunty.

27
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:54,000
Just 2 minutes, please.

28
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:59,830
"We move without hesitation..."

29
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:02,880
"..even in the face of fear."

30
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:05,380
"We are mature..."

31
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:07,330
- Evening Inaamdar Sir.
- How are you, Sonali?

32
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,330
Great!

33
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:10,080
What's up, girl?

34
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:13,670
Let's go, you glutton.

35
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:20,460
Greetings ma'am.

36
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,210
How is everything?

37
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:23,580
Fine.

38
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:43,920
"We are combustible...
..and young."

39
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:50,920
"Totally stubborn...
..our dreams, our dreams."

40
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:17,080
"Let it break,let it get away...
..let us loose."

41
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:23,830
"Let us fall and get up again...
..let us steady ourselves."

42
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:29,580
"Let us fall and get up again...
..let us steady ourselves."

43
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:37,170
"If someone opposes us...
..we will cross the bridge then."

44
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:44,540
"We are combustible...
..and young."

45
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:51,630
"Totally stubborn...
..our dreams, our dreams."

46
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,080
After dominating markets in telecom
refineries, healthcare and agriculture...

47
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:12,130
...the Fortune 500-listed Shining Corp.
is now dominating Broadband Internet.

48
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:17,040
We bring you an exclusive interview
with Shining chairman Narayan Singh Vaghela.

49
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:37,630
Friends. If you want to be born,
we have hospitals.

50
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:42,000
If you don't want to be born,
we make condoms.

51
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,960
If you want to die, we have
air-conditioned crematoriums.

52
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:52,630
We are here to meet your every need.

53
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:57,210
And if you can't afford it,
we'll finance you.

54
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:01,250
If you are with us,
we are with you all the way.

55
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:07,040
In life and beyond,
we'll always be together, Shining!

56
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:09,500
How are you?

57
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:15,500
Eat it!

58
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:17,920
Just joking.

59
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:22,830
Thank you.

60
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:30,750
The people of India
and the Shining Group are lovers.

61
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:37,630
And when a third person comes between us
it's just not very enjoyable.

62
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:41,790
It is... a love story, dear.

63
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:44,500
Love story.

64
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:17,880
The internet business is all I know.
At least give me a job in your company.

65
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:21,960
Madhavan.

66
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,500
You won't fit in here, Mr. Shetty.

67
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,250
So please, go home.

68
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,080
Please.

69
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,000
What?

70
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:38,290
"It is a love story, dear".

71
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:44,290
Holy shit!

72
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:47,210
More viruses?

73
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:50,830
A lot.

74
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:53,330
Oh!

75
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:55,710
So what now?

76
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:00,880
How do we get rid of the virus, Sada?

77
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:08,290
Actually, we'll have to
reformat the hard dicks.

78
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:19,210
So, did you take care
of Chanda madam's virus?

79
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:20,630
Still some left.

80
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:25,790
Be gentle with it.

81
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:27,540
Hurry up.

82
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:29,630
Sada.

83
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,170
Hey Sada. Have you seen any Shining
people in our area?

84
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:38,670
They're like shadows.
They don't have a face, only guile.

85
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:43,080
- Jayyu, check now.
- Yeah I'm doing it.

86
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:46,460
- Who's the rookie?
- Jayyu hired him.

87
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:48,580
Without asking me?

88
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:50,000
I've never seen him in our area.

89
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:52,710
Area? He's not even
from our country.

90
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:53,830
Bangladesh?

91
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:55,630
Fully illegal.

92
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:56,880
Jayyu is going to
get us into deep shit.

93
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:00,330
Sonali.

94
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:01,790
Ma'am is here.

95
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:06,630
Come.

96
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:24,960
Ok.

97
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,040
Raghu.

98
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,630
Sonali Dattaram Tandel?

99
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,630
Roll number 43!

100
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:45,170
How've you been?

101
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:48,290
Good. And you?

102
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:49,290
Fit.

103
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:55,710
Ma'am didn't tell me
that you were back.

104
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:58,380
I didn't even tell her. I just showed up.
Last night.

105
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,830
After eight years.
Just like that?

106
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,880
- Yeah. Just like that.
- Good.

107
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,290
I hear you've become
quite famous around here.

108
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:12,170
Yeah right! But it's going good.

109
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:14,920
- Swing by the centre sometime.
- Yes, I will, definitely.

110
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:22,460
So... how long are you staying?

111
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,710
Raghu... Sonali...

112
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:36,960
It's not our job to
give speeches.

113
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,920
So I'll just say a couple of words.

114
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:43,920
Thank you, Sonali.

115
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:50,380
It's not our job to
give speeches either.

116
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:52,130
We are a "social service".

117
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:55,330
Our friend, Sonali is an even bigger
"social service".

118
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:00,040
Didn't Bunty Pandey run a gang?

119
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,290
Social club.

120
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,380
And his brother, Sada.
He works with you?

121
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:08,960
He's like my son.

122
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,750
Sonali is the reason,
the guys from our neighbourhood...

123
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:20,580
They do good work.

124
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,790
That's all. Long live India.

125
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:31,460
And my job is to only give speeches...

126
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,130
Which is why I told Sonali...

127
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:39,290
That I would invest in her centre
on one condition.

128
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:41,830
It should help the community.

129
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,580
I educated my son, Raghu, in America.

130
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:48,830
I told him too, we need to make Maharashtra
reach the heights of America.

131
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:52,330
I called him back home.
And here he is.

132
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:55,130
It's great time for Mumbai.

133
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,830
Long live India and Maharashtra.

134
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,670
Have it sir.

135
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:02,460
Have it.

136
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:07,790
Kiddo. Come visit sometime.

137
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:09,630
Anytime.

138
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:14,130
Why? Are you itching
to hit me again?

139
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:17,790
Transfer is not that easy.

140
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:18,790
Let's go.

141
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:21,920
Ma'am. Can I come by this evening?

142
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:25,000
- Why?
- I wanted to talk to you about Shining.

143
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:27,710
Now Raghu's back. He will handle it.

144
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,540
Raghu's back for good?

145
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:34,000
Yes. Raghu will handle
the business from now.

146
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37,960
Understood?

147
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:48,500
Thanks.

148
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:51,540
- Can I get a ride?
- Sure.

149
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,170
Raghu! Careful!

150
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:25,500
Relax. He'll handle it.
He's your son after all.

151
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:28,630
Have you forgotten
whose daughter she is?

152
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:35,250
Vada Pav.

153
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:38,210
What the hell is this?

154
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:42,960
Stop ripping me off.
Give me a bigger bunch.

155
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:46,040
Keep all of it.

156
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:50,630
I'm going back to my village.

157
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:58,830
All these years we kept driving you
Northerners out, you wouldn't leave.

158
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,500
Doing Mumbai a favour, are you?

159
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:04,460
How do I compete with these big companies
and their supermarkets?

160
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:06,040
I can't afford to sell any cheaper.

161
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:08,170
Drive them out first!

162
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:09,880
- Long live Maharashtra.
- Long live Maharashtra.

163
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:15,670
Hey, Mr. America, you're back!

164
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:19,830
- How are you?
- Dad, we're going to the office.

165
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:22,330
First, you'll have to step into my office.

166
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:32,290
What's all this?

167
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:34,960
That's my portfolio.

168
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:36,710
Portfolio!

169
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:41,670
Check it out.
The deadly riots of Bhiwandi.

170
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,750
That's me driving out the Southies.

171
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:50,250
Oh, this here is from
the Hindu-Muslim riots.

172
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:54,540
I'm in every picture. Throwing stones
with a towel around my face.

173
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:57,540
Riot specialist, Datta Tandel.

174
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:03,750
The amount of stones I threw,
you could build a bridge.

175
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:05,960
Drink?

176
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:07,960
No. Thanks.

177
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:23,790
Hello Sonali cable.

178
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:27,000
Wrong number.
Chingam, get some tea. Raghu's here.

179
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:33,750
Yeah I know, the spelling is wrong.

180
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:34,540
It's fine.

181
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:36,960
- We were busy so we just...
- Relax.

182
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,130
- Come in.
- Sure.

183
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:55,420
None of these guys finished college.
Just like us.

184
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,460
Thank you.

185
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:04,210
Chingam.

186
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:05,460
Thank you.

187
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:09,330
Have a seat.
Give him a chair.

188
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,500
Hello Sonali cable centre.

189
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,920
Yes, Sir. How are you?

190
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:22,170
You shouldn't get an error.
I'll look into it.

191
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:26,000
Hey nutjob! They're still getting
connection errors in Aquarius.

192
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:27,830
Jayyu was looking into it.

193
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:29,250
Jayyu.

194
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:33,170
Jayyu.

195
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,210
- What happened?
- Did you go to Aquarius?

196
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,630
- I'm going.
- Why are you still here?

197
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,080
- I told you, I'm going!

198
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:42,580
What's keeping you?
A date with your mom?

199
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,750
Keep my mother out of it.

200
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:46,540
You fool..

201
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:50,500
You're ruining our reputation
and I'm supposed to just shut up?

202
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:53,130
You want me to worship you, rascal?

203
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:59,630
Hello Sir. Five minutes.
You'll be online.

204
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:02,710
Sada go.

205
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,380
Aquarius is my building.
I'll go.

206
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,710
You!

207
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:07,750
Go!

208
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:11,130
And who signed off on this rookie?

209
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:12,630
No need to go.

210
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:15,330
- I've fixed it.
- What?

211
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,710
- How did you do that?
- And that too sitting here.

212
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,420
Just did it.

213
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:26,210
- How did you do it?
- It takes lot of time.

214
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,250
Hello Sonali cable.

215
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,540
Who's speaking?

216
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,040
Yeah, this is Sonali Tandel.

217
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:42,460
If they want to meet,
it'll have to be at my office.

218
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:44,710
Who was that?

219
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:48,710
Shining.

220
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:57,750
She wants me to come to her office?

221
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:00,420
Ok.

222
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:02,290
Thank you.

223
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:23,210
You're quite the badass!
Why worry about Shining?

224
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:26,670
It's not Shining.

225
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:37,170
Then, what's the problem?

226
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:41,920
- Why'd you come back?
- What would I do there?

227
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:46,710
Obama wanted to make
me his son-in-law.

228
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:50,880
I said, no thanks.
I'm married to India.

229
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:57,250
So, what's the problem?

230
00:19:57,790 --> 00:20:01,210
Look, your mom owns 60% of the centre
and I own forty.

231
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,130
Forty.

232
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:04,080
Forty.

233
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:05,330
Forty.

234
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:06,460
Forty.

235
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:09,710
- Four...
- Leave the Forty!

236
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:12,670
Your mom said you'll
handle the business from now.

237
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:15,710
Mom's a politician.

238
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:18,000
And what are you?

239
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:22,170
You tell me.

240
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,420
- What's happening?
- Same old crap.

241
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,710
- How are you?
- I'm doing good.

242
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:40,170
Remember the Hindi exam
from 10th grade? Probably not.

243
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,290
I remember it.
The last test I ever took.

244
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:46,670
There was phrase in there.

245
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:51,500
"Two swords cannot
share the same sheath".

246
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:55,130
Sonali Dattaram Tandel.

247
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,380
Roll number 43!

248
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,960
The sheath is yours,
and so is the sword.

249
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:03,960
But your sword is blunt.

250
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:05,250
Meaning?

251
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:11,000
Meaning, you need someone to sharpen it.
A manager.

252
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,460
So what does the "sword sharpener" say?

253
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:19,000
Don't wait for the enemy. Face him,
in his own style.

254
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:45,080
What?

255
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:48,080
- Nothing. You look great.
- You want me to change.

256
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:52,710
You'll look great even in a burkha.
Let's go. Please, tell her.

257
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:55,080
Hello.

258
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,580
We are just stuck in traffic.
we will be there in a swish.

259
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,750
I brought my car.

260
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:04,210
Don't you want to be there in a swish?

261
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:23,330
Ouch.

262
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,080
Name Raghu Pawar.

263
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,420
Resident of blah blah blah.

264
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:32,210
Education qualification...

265
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:33,380
Schooling from..

266
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:36,670
Bachelor's from Phoenix University.

267
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,130
And masters from Temple University.

268
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:52,580
You've got an M.B.A.

269
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,040
Thank you.
So we speak the same language.

270
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:56,210
See Raghu...

271
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,000
To cut the long story short.

272
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,960
- This little shop of your's...
- Mr. Bose.

273
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:03,960
-Bobby.
- Bobby.

274
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:08,130
It's her company.
I'm just a manager like you.

275
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:10,250
So you just speak to her.

276
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:11,920
She is the boss.

277
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:13,040
Hello.

278
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:26,040
Okay, Boss.
Listen up.

279
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,170
Game over!

280
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:32,210
Find something else to do.
You've got a week.

281
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:33,330
What the hell is he saying?

282
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:38,830
You have one week.

283
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:40,920
Shop close.

284
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:41,960
You think it's a joke?

285
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:42,170
You think it's a joke?

286
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,330
Is everthing alright sir?

287
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:46,210
Yes. It's ok.

288
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,080
One second.

289
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:55,750
Are you serious?

290
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:58,880
There is no offer!

291
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:01,500
Yes. There is.

292
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,580
Bombay Burger!
Specially for you.

293
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:13,580
-Nice.
- Let's go.

294
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,130
This is very funny.

295
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:18,500
We attended the meeting.
Note that!

296
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,630
And hello, it's not Bombay Burger.

297
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:22,330
It's called Vada pav
learn your language.

298
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:24,210
Hey Raghu...

299
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:25,580
Raghu Pawar.

300
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:28,580
Raghu.

301
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,040
Please wait...

302
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:34,210
Raghu, make her understand.

303
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:38,920
We'll shut you down and
rub your noses in scum.

304
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:41,830
Bring it on rascal!

305
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,420
Just try!

306
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:44,670
I'll smash your face.

307
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:47,250
I'll cut your nose off dumbass!

308
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:57,960
Bangladesh is whooping Australia!
Unbeleivable!

309
00:24:59,330 --> 00:24:59,960
In short.

310
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:03,210
Basically, they'll try to finish us.
We have to be ready.

311
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:04,580
To get finished?

312
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:06,750
Be serious.

313
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:10,130
- I am serious...
- Just hear her out, Jayyu. Calmly.

314
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:13,040
We'll drown in their ocean.

315
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,920
We'll swim in it!

316
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:18,080
Sonali, this is us!

317
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:21,920
Shining is building an office nearby.

318
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:25,460
Their toilet is as big as our office!

319
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:26,830
Dude, chill!

320
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:29,330
Stop harping on Shining.

321
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:34,210
Just remember.
Even a tiny, little ant...

322
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:37,580
...can make an elephant
do the disco.

323
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,710
It's all about biting the right spot.

324
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:45,420
Learn! Optimism.

325
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,880
Rosy repeat.

326
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:56,000
Rosy.

327
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:59,000
Bobby, you were saying...

328
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:04,710
Sir, we've used warning, negotiation,
punishment and division.

329
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:07,920
I'm sure you've heard of
the art of war.

330
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:09,130
Ramayan.

331
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:14,330
Go on.

332
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:19,000
So we've turned every stone.

333
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:21,880
We've almost taken control
of all of Mumbai's internet lines.

334
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:24,000
- What was that?
- All of Mumbai...

335
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,670
Before that!

336
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:27,130
Almost...

337
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:30,460
Almost is almost.
And whole is whole.

338
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:31,880
It's not the same thing.

339
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:39,210
When I was a young boy...

340
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,670
When I was child...

341
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:46,380
My mom used to make me
filter the rice.

342
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:50,790
And if she found even
a single piece of dirt in there...

343
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:53,960
...then all I got for dinner
was a glass of water.

344
00:26:54,210 --> 00:27:00,830
And that's why I can afford a $2,500 drink,
that you can't even afford to smell.

345
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:06,000
Warning, negotiation, punishment
division, and then - "almost"!

346
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:10,080
I want the whole city, you twit!
All of Mumbai!

347
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:16,460
Repeat.

348
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:20,500
Rosy.

349
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:21,250
Come here.

350
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:22,630
Broken wafer.

351
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:24,420
Broken wafer.

352
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:26,960
I never eat broken wafer.

353
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,130
- Say sorry.
- Sorry sir.

354
00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:30,210
- Say sorry.
- Sorry sir.

355
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:31,880
Never.

356
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:39,420
Ok.

357
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:42,540
Don't throw.

358
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:44,170
Give it to crow.

359
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:47,210
So...

360
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:52,250
Let alone a computer...

361
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:56,540
I've never even used a calculator.

362
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:02,460
But, my computer says that
this cable internet...

363
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:07,380
It's like that thing between a mother
and her child. What is it called?

364
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:09,880
What is it?
That tube...

365
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,080
Rosy come here.

366
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:12,170
That child...

367
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:13,790
And Mother inside that rod...

368
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:15,580
- That connection.
- umbilical cord.

369
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:17,210
Yes, the cord!

370
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:21,790
Every home that our cables enter,
will be under our control.

371
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:24,080
And I want every single home!

372
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:28,670
Get your act together.

373
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,540
Get rid of these fancy clothes
and enter the bullring.

374
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:34,130
Mr. English-medium boy!

375
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:58,460
"One glimpse...
..and you by my side."

376
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:16,040
"One glimpse...
..and you by my side."

377
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:21,790
"I live to please you."

378
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:33,630
"You are my guide...
..I have found you, I am complete."

379
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:45,040
"Just need to see one glimpse
of you to live this life."

380
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:56,290
"Yeah I just need one glimpse."

381
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:12,920
"Every moment without
you feels like eternity."

382
00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:18,170
"I roam around like a nomad."

383
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:22,710
"I am like half a sky."

384
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:29,130
"Can’t stay away from you."

385
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:39,420
"You are my guide...
..I have found you, I am complete."

386
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:43,420
So, the cable centre is
keeping you quite busy.

387
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:46,210
I'm just helping Sonali
out a little.

388
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:50,330
Don't get too entangled.
I have bigger plans for you.

389
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:51,960
Sonali Cable will be huge one day.

390
00:30:52,290 --> 00:30:56,380
But that girl won't get anywhere.

391
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:04,920
Come on, mom.
We've grown up together.

392
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:06,830
She needs me.

393
00:31:10,290 --> 00:31:12,750
Needs can easily turn into habits.

394
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:15,830
And bad habits are hard to break.

395
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:22,710
I will be back in a while.

396
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:24,500
Played?

397
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:35,830
"Just need to see one glimpse
of you to live this life..."

398
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:47,710
"..yeah I just need one glimpse."

399
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:11,330
Whoa!

400
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:13,790
Love story?

401
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:15,960
Please continue.

402
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,170
- And you'll watch?
- Yeah!

403
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:20,210
You pervert!

404
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,380
How are you?

405
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:30,080
It's, "How are you Madam!"

406
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:35,290
Mrs. Pawar, I'm hoping
you will understand the reality.

407
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:37,500
Our company is not just India's
leading corporation.

408
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:40,460
In fact, it's world renowned.

409
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:44,420
Does it matter to the goat
if the butcher's knife is studded with diamonds?

410
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:47,210
But Mrs. Pawar, we are vegetarian.

411
00:32:48,210 --> 00:32:50,580
Well, we're anything but vegetarian.

412
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:59,420
Look Ma'am, when the Government
constructs roads...

413
00:32:59,670 --> 00:33:04,250
...homes, shops, factories
have to be sacrificed. They must make way.

414
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:08,540
Right now, in this city,
we are the Government.

415
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:12,290
When not in power,
we are the devil.

416
00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:18,630
And if we lose our cool,
your ass will burn!

417
00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:23,040
But Ma'am, I thought, you'd understand
the importance of this project.

418
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:25,130
And I thought you're here to compromise.

419
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:28,460
First, you throw a ridiculous,
one-week deadline at Raghu.

420
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:30,750
And now you follow it up with a threat?

421
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:32,960
And a vegetarian one at that?

422
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:37,290
Brother. Get him out of here.

423
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:44,460
- What's up?
- Bobby Bose met mom.

424
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:47,630
- That twit! And?
- She drove him away.

425
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:51,710
- Really?
- Listen, I have to go see her about this.

426
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,630
Yeah, carry on.
I got this covered.

427
00:33:55,250 --> 00:34:00,380
There's a party at home this evening.
You'll be there, right?

428
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,040
Dad.

429
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:10,540
Dad.

430
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:16,710
What's so funny?

431
00:34:17,170 --> 00:34:19,630
Trapped in the net like a fish.

432
00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:24,000
You are not wearing it correctly.
Wait I'll show you.

433
00:34:30,290 --> 00:34:32,040
Couldn't you have picked
something else to wear?

434
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:37,330
So what if it's mom's?
This one's on our team.

435
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:43,630
- Nice?
- Very.

436
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:52,000
Our team will never win, Sona.

437
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,790
It doesn't matter what you wear.

438
00:34:55,170 --> 00:34:59,210
Ma'am will never
let you marry her son.

439
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:03,670
Oh please!
We've known each other for 20 years.

440
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,460
It's just matter of naming our relationship.

441
00:35:09,130 --> 00:35:13,250
Name it what you want.
You'll always be tainted.

442
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:21,290
The tainted daughter of a slut
who left her family in the lurch.

443
00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:24,500
I don't want to ruin my make-up.

444
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:29,710
- Should I make you another drink?
- No. I'll help myself.

445
00:36:23,330 --> 00:36:26,790
So, this is how you drink
in Bangladesh?

446
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:31,460
I'm not from Bangladesh.
I'm from Kolkata, West Bengal.

447
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:34,750
Yeah, and I'm from Korea.
Sada Kimchi!

448
00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:36,880
Hey Sada, just drink man.

449
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,710
Leave him alone.

450
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,580
He's a real geek.
Works magic with the computer.

451
00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:46,170
A solid technician.

452
00:36:46,210 --> 00:36:50,750
- How does it matter where he's from?
- It matters, Jayyu.

453
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:53,380
It matters to Sonali.
She's our boss.

454
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:03,170
Hey Romeo,
Jabbo's on her way.

455
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:05,540
What are you drinking?

456
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:14,500
- Someone's smokin'!
- Hot huh?

457
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:15,920
Bring out the whip!

458
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:19,790
What a diva!

459
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,500
Who's that bomb?

460
00:37:41,170 --> 00:37:44,170
I'll make you meet
someone every special.

461
00:37:44,210 --> 00:37:45,040
Alright.

462
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,080
Guess who.

463
00:37:53,290 --> 00:37:54,330
Sonali.

464
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:55,380
Zooni.

465
00:37:55,790 --> 00:37:58,750
Oh, Zooni!
Mr. Mattoo's daughter.

466
00:37:58,790 --> 00:38:00,540
- Hi.
- Hi.

467
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:04,420
My, how you've grown!

468
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:06,630
Everyone does.

469
00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:13,040
Weren't you studying in America?

470
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:17,460
I got my Masters in Computer science
from M.I.T.

471
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:23,380
Degrees are useless in Mumbai.

472
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:25,000
You need guts!

473
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:28,830
She's going to join Mr. Mattoo.
She's the future of Race Net.

474
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:31,330
Future.

475
00:38:33,790 --> 00:38:35,170
Look, Mr. Mattoo.

476
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:41,080
Who's Mr. Motoo (Fatso)?

477
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:44,210
That's not how we say it in India.

478
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:48,500
He owns Race Net.
And we sell Race Net Broadband.

479
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:51,420
A crook with a fancy hat.

480
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:57,000
What's with your...hat?

481
00:38:58,420 --> 00:38:59,330
I fell.

482
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:01,500
Where?

483
00:39:03,290 --> 00:39:04,130
In life.

484
00:39:05,330 --> 00:39:06,540
Give me a break!

485
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:14,040
I've promised Mr. Mattoo that
we will sell Race Net broadband exclusively.

486
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:18,000
Yes, Ma'am. Especially after what
those Shining guys did today...

487
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:23,080
Help me out in the kitchen, will you?
Let them talk business.

488
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:24,580
You come with me.

489
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:25,960
Come.

490
00:39:26,290 --> 00:39:27,540
Hey that's my song.

491
00:39:28,290 --> 00:39:29,000
Come on Raghu.

492
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:32,000
All good, kiddo?

493
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,000
It was.

494
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:43,880
B.D...

495
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:59,000
Ma'am, I'm glad you turned
Shining down.

496
00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:03,210
Mr. Mattoo does not need
to know everything.

497
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:07,210
Think before you speak.

498
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:10,330
And if you can't,
then just keep quiet.

499
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:12,580
Sorry, Ma'am.

500
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:16,420
It's okay.

501
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:20,170
Zooni and Raghu
will take care of everything.

502
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:23,830
Their friendship started in America,
and will continue to grow.

503
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:25,630
They're well-matched.

504
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,250
You were having trouble
handling the pressure.

505
00:40:31,290 --> 00:40:35,040
So I asked Raghu to step in.
And here he is.

506
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,790
He loves you very much.

507
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:44,710
When I see you two together...

508
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:47,540
It feels good.

509
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,960
I always wanted a daughter.

510
00:40:56,830 --> 00:40:59,080
Think of me as your daughter.

511
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:05,380
You are a daughter to me...

512
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:12,170
And a sister to Raghu.

513
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:59,880
This phone call is the last pacifier
I'm shoving into your mouth.

514
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:02,460
No more "almosts".

515
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:05,210
- Got it?
- No "almosts".

516
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:07,460
You're my witness, Madhavan.

517
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:12,540
Sona. Why are you crying?

518
00:42:17,630 --> 00:42:19,830
Where are you off to?

519
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:22,130
To see Lord Ganesha.

520
00:42:23,830 --> 00:42:24,540
Sona...

521
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:26,670
Bhau Sir.

522
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:30,380
What a surprise.
The big ship himself!

523
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:36,420
We ships come and go.
You're our harbour.

524
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:41,670
Tell me.
What can we do for each other?

525
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:48,250
A small problem needs fixing.
Something my morons couldn't handle.

526
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:50,630
I'll take care of it.

527
00:42:58,630 --> 00:43:00,420
My respects, Bhau.

528
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:03,380
Anything urgent?

529
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,830
Mistakes are better rectified early.

530
00:43:07,170 --> 00:43:09,250
Did I do something wrong?

531
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:12,960
Rights and wrongs are
two sides of the same coin.

532
00:43:13,790 --> 00:43:16,880
Let's go inside.
Someone's here to meet you.

533
00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:20,750
To meet me?

534
00:43:26,130 --> 00:43:28,170
How are you, Taai?

535
00:43:28,210 --> 00:43:30,880
Don't gloat.
Just take her blessing.

536
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:31,960
Ofcourse.

537
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,630
Meena, give him your blessing.

538
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:54,380
Keep going.

539
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:57,460
- Why are you here?
- To take you home.

540
00:43:58,460 --> 00:44:00,790
Don't make me swear in front of Gannu.

541
00:44:00,830 --> 00:44:02,380
Why have you blown a fuse?

542
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:08,790
Because you're fused to that witch.

543
00:44:09,790 --> 00:44:13,210
The least you could've done
is told me earlier.

544
00:44:13,790 --> 00:44:15,630
I was on standby for you
all these years.

545
00:44:15,670 --> 00:44:17,630
Are you nuts?
Zooni and I?

546
00:44:17,670 --> 00:44:22,670
Yes, Zooni and you. Your stupid American
friendship, your rich-ass wedding...

547
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,670
And whatever she pops out after that.

548
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:26,170
Get lost!

549
00:44:26,210 --> 00:44:27,040
Damn.

550
00:44:27,830 --> 00:44:29,540
Did mom say something?

551
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,540
Will she ever miss an opportunity?

552
00:44:31,790 --> 00:44:32,830
Whatever she said...

553
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:36,040
- ...I've seen it with my own eyes.
- Bullshit!

554
00:44:36,330 --> 00:44:38,500
She's Mr. Mattoo's daughter,
so of course I know her.

555
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:44,080
And I met her once in Disneyland.
She was on top, I was below, on that thing...

556
00:44:44,330 --> 00:44:49,000
She was on top? And you under her?
Hollywood style?

557
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:51,880
This is ridiculous.
There's nothing between us.

558
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:54,790
And there's nothing between us either!

559
00:44:57,170 --> 00:45:01,670
And anyway, according to your mom...

560
00:45:02,630 --> 00:45:04,000
I'm your sister.

561
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:14,500
Just give me my forty percent.
I'm quitting the business. The end!

562
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:26,630
Yes, Mr. Naulakha.

563
00:45:27,130 --> 00:45:28,250
What can I do for you.

564
00:45:28,670 --> 00:45:31,210
Of course, we can install WiFi
all over your building.

565
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:34,920
I'll have Jayyu work up a quote.

566
00:45:35,830 --> 00:45:36,750
Yes.

567
00:45:37,790 --> 00:45:39,420
Ok.

568
00:45:40,790 --> 00:45:41,710
Bye.

569
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:49,880
You were saying...

570
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:53,580
Raghu, I'm seriously quitting.

571
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:57,580
Good call.

572
00:45:57,630 --> 00:45:59,380
What do you mean?

573
00:46:00,170 --> 00:46:03,250
Shining guys pulled muscle.
Bhau called mom.

574
00:46:04,210 --> 00:46:06,790
- What now?
- We have to meet Bobby Bose again.

575
00:46:06,830 --> 00:46:10,380
You go meet him with that witch, Zooni.
Go flaunt your English together.

576
00:46:10,830 --> 00:46:14,500
The centre is your baby, right?
Will you abandon it?

577
00:46:14,790 --> 00:46:18,170
- They'll take you down. You'll go offline.
- I'll slap you!

578
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:21,040
Okay. Now finish your idol
and let's get going.

579
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:29,540
- She's a loose cannon.
- Meaning?

580
00:46:30,290 --> 00:46:34,420
- A wild one.
- And how do we tame her?

581
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:38,580
- Using her boyfriend.
- And what about him?

582
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:41,460
He'll play. If the price is right.

583
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:44,880
Even God needs an offering.

584
00:47:03,330 --> 00:47:04,250
Hello.

585
00:47:04,790 --> 00:47:05,710
Firstly...

586
00:47:06,250 --> 00:47:08,540
I am very sorry about last meeting.

587
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:15,880
So yes the deal...

588
00:47:16,130 --> 00:47:18,920
The deal is that nothing changes, really.

589
00:47:19,630 --> 00:47:21,920
Except that you'll sell Shining Broadband.

590
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:23,540
Oh you mean partnership.

591
00:47:23,580 --> 00:47:25,130
No. Employees.

592
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:30,330
You'll work for Shining. Top salaries
and a mind-blowing settlement scheme for...

593
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:32,880
Sonali.

594
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:34,880
Sonali cable.

595
00:47:35,670 --> 00:47:37,460
Yes, Sonali cable.

596
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:44,710
- And what will happen to Race Net?
- They'll get shut down.

597
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,330
Shining will be the sole
broadband provider in this city.

598
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:49,790
Drinks?

599
00:47:52,790 --> 00:47:53,710
Mr. Bobby...

600
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:54,710
Come.

601
00:47:55,250 --> 00:47:56,420
Please come.

602
00:47:59,250 --> 00:48:03,960
Just look at that. Mumbai's largest
Ganesha idol. 25 feet tall.

603
00:48:04,540 --> 00:48:09,750
And right beside it, a common man's
tiny version. Barely a foot tall.

604
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:12,880
Both are paraded together.

605
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:14,420
They mean the same to everyone.

606
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:18,460
Nobody pushes the small one aside.

607
00:48:18,790 --> 00:48:22,670
Each idol has space, respect and value.

608
00:48:22,710 --> 00:48:22,830
Each idol has space, respect and value.

609
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:25,330
And value is what I'm giving you.

610
00:48:25,630 --> 00:48:26,540
Come on Raghu.

611
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,460
We're offering $160,000.

612
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:31,830
In one bloody payment
and a fat bloody...

613
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:33,170
We don't want al that Mr. Bobby.

614
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:38,330
Three thousand relationships
are not for sale.

615
00:48:40,170 --> 00:48:43,830
Raghu, your mom owns a 60% stake.

616
00:48:44,330 --> 00:48:45,080
Owned.

617
00:48:46,830 --> 00:48:48,540
Now it belongs to me.

618
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,460
I respect what Ms. Meena Pawar wants.

619
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:54,330
But Sonali and I get the final say.

620
00:48:54,380 --> 00:48:55,040
That's for you.

621
00:48:55,330 --> 00:48:57,710
Sonali. There won't be any more meetings.

622
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:01,290
Meet, cheat, do as you please.

623
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:03,920
You can't hide from Lord Ganesha.

624
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:04,880
He is watching you.

625
00:49:07,630 --> 00:49:09,830
All hail Lord Ganesha!

626
00:49:13,130 --> 00:49:15,830
Why, Sonali?
Why did you behave like that?

627
00:49:17,380 --> 00:49:21,380
Didn't Raghu explain the
political pressures?

628
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:26,250
Meena, how can you expect these
low lifes to understand such things?

629
00:49:27,580 --> 00:49:30,500
- Look at her family...
- Keep my family out of it!

630
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:32,330
Which family? What...

631
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:33,710
Just shut up!

632
00:49:35,630 --> 00:49:38,330
She's come a long way on her own.

633
00:49:38,750 --> 00:49:41,040
Don't forget you're in her office.

634
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:43,710
And if I were you,
I'd apologize immediately.

635
00:49:45,830 --> 00:49:48,920
After the damage she's done,
you want me to apologize?

636
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:52,000
I would apologize. Now!

637
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:55,250
Meena.

638
00:49:55,290 --> 00:49:58,880
Dada. An apology is in order.

639
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:00,670
But...

640
00:50:09,250 --> 00:50:10,170
Sorry.

641
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:17,000
Raghu, Sonali and I need to talk.

642
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:21,460
Oh mom. I can't handle
any more miscommunication.

643
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:25,920
I'm good here.
Go on, talk.

644
00:50:26,170 --> 00:50:27,420
- Leave!
- Leave!

645
00:50:40,250 --> 00:50:46,920
Sonali, you can't have what's not yours,
can you?

646
00:50:47,290 --> 00:50:52,380
Absolutely. But what's mine, I can't let go.

647
00:50:54,250 --> 00:50:54,920
Can I?

648
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:57,380
Let go of Raghu, Sonali.

649
00:50:57,420 --> 00:51:01,380
Raghu?
I was talking about the centre.

650
00:51:02,130 --> 00:51:04,500
And in Raghu's case...

651
00:51:05,380 --> 00:51:06,710
I don't really need to hold on.

652
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:08,330
And if I have to...

653
00:51:11,170 --> 00:51:12,750
Then it just wasn't meant to be.

654
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:04,580
"Jaani Janardhan or John."

655
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:07,420
"A celebrity or Don."

656
00:52:07,750 --> 00:52:10,500
"Giver of happiness...
..giver of food and water."

657
00:52:10,540 --> 00:52:13,130
"Who is the king of Mumbai?"

658
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:16,080
"Lord Ganesha rocks."

659
00:52:18,790 --> 00:52:21,380
"Lord Ganesha rocks."

660
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:28,710
"Strength to the weak...
..faith to the lost."

661
00:52:28,750 --> 00:52:31,330
"Lord you give...
..peace to every being."

662
00:52:31,710 --> 00:52:36,960
"Whether it’s a mountain or an anthill...
..everyone dances at your will."

663
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:42,460
"Good, bad or ugly...
..a pauper or a prince."

664
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:45,250
"Giver of happiness...
..giver of food and water."

665
00:52:45,290 --> 00:52:47,880
"Who is the king of Mumbai?"

666
00:52:48,130 --> 00:52:50,710
"Lord Ganesha rocks."

667
00:52:53,540 --> 00:52:56,130
"Lord Ganesha rocks."

668
00:53:17,540 --> 00:53:20,290
"A Mansion or a hut in Chembur."

669
00:53:20,330 --> 00:53:22,920
"A plate spun from sugar
or made from gold."

670
00:53:23,170 --> 00:53:25,750
"They bow their heads
for the vermilion."

671
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:28,710
"For you they all come together."

672
00:53:28,750 --> 00:53:31,250
"Jaani Janardhan or John."

673
00:53:31,580 --> 00:53:34,210
"A celebrity or Don."

674
00:53:34,250 --> 00:53:37,000
"Giver of happiness...
..giver of food and water."

675
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:39,630
"Who is the king of Mumbai?"

676
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,080
"GLord Ganesha rocks."

677
00:53:59,580 --> 00:54:02,500
The centre means everything
to you, doesn't it?

678
00:54:03,670 --> 00:54:07,130
Correct. Just the centre.

679
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:10,170
Ever wondered why?

680
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:16,130
I don't know.

681
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:24,130
It's late.

682
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:27,170
Shall I leave?

683
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:35,830
Raghu.

684
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:37,790
Wait for a while.

685
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:46,380
There's something on your cheek.

686
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:54,250
There's something on your cheek too.

687
00:54:57,130 --> 00:54:58,960
Weren't you leaving?

688
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:04,290
I'm already gone.

689
00:55:09,580 --> 00:55:10,670
Me too.

690
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:16,210
"I want to kiss you...
..and feel our love."

691
00:55:16,250 --> 00:55:21,420
"When you are by my side
this calm descends on me."

692
00:55:21,460 --> 00:55:26,290
"This is the start of our romance..."

693
00:55:26,630 --> 00:55:32,460
"..our silence says it all."

694
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:43,880
"Just need to see one glimpse
of you to live this life."

695
00:55:51,170 --> 00:55:53,130
It feels just like home.
After the Durga festival.

696
00:55:53,170 --> 00:55:55,960
It feels just like home.
After the Durga festival.

697
00:55:56,330 --> 00:55:57,500
Totally empty.

698
00:55:59,130 --> 00:56:01,790
You mean West Bengal? Kolkata?

699
00:56:03,210 --> 00:56:06,920
Bangladesh. Khulna.

700
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:11,420
Where did you fall?

701
00:56:12,630 --> 00:56:16,000
It's your turn today.
Why are you so pissed at your brother?

702
00:56:17,750 --> 00:56:18,750
Say.

703
00:56:18,790 --> 00:56:19,710
Tell me.

704
00:56:21,790 --> 00:56:22,710
Let it out.

705
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:34,630
He branded you?

706
00:56:34,670 --> 00:56:38,210
Since then, he has a thing for hot stuff.

707
00:56:39,750 --> 00:56:42,880
Lighten up, man!

708
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:45,880
B.D. is too slow
in understanding jokes.

709
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:58,000
You know why the centre
means so much to me?

710
00:56:58,330 --> 00:57:00,210
Why?

711
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:05,290
It takes me inside people's homes.

712
00:57:06,460 --> 00:57:11,210
- I love that.
- Why?

713
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:17,960
Because... homes have a fragrance.

714
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:28,960
A mother's fragrance.

715
00:57:32,630 --> 00:57:34,630
Which my home will never have.

716
00:57:37,250 --> 00:57:39,540
This isn't even a home.

717
00:57:49,830 --> 00:57:53,630
Three thousand homes.
Three thousand!

718
00:57:56,290 --> 00:57:58,250
Our homes.

719
00:58:05,710 --> 00:58:07,040
Jayyu get up, call somebody.

720
00:58:34,830 --> 00:58:36,250
- Leave me!
- No.

721
00:58:38,170 --> 00:58:39,420
What the hell!

722
01:00:16,420 --> 01:00:17,330
Hello Sonali cable centre.

723
01:00:19,130 --> 01:00:20,920
Yes sir, there was a little problem.

724
01:00:21,580 --> 01:00:24,830
Please check now.
You should be back online.

725
01:00:40,790 --> 01:00:44,380
Kiddo. We'll move you to private.
It's five star.

726
01:00:44,710 --> 01:00:47,420
- A room with a sea view.
- Great.

727
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,460
Sonali will take care of you.

728
01:00:50,790 --> 01:00:52,210
She's like my mom.

729
01:00:56,130 --> 01:00:57,170
Can I kiss you too?

730
01:01:01,330 --> 01:01:02,420
Bring it on.

731
01:01:17,710 --> 01:01:20,210
He's been watching too many TV soaps.

732
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:34,710
Mummy.

733
01:01:35,580 --> 01:01:38,460
Looks like Raghu took care of your virus.

734
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:39,880
Shut up you rascal.

735
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:47,960
Wow Sada, you ripped his pants off!

736
01:01:48,210 --> 01:01:50,830
You almost bit his butt off.

737
01:01:51,170 --> 01:01:56,710
What did you expect?
That I'd sit him down and worship him?

738
01:01:57,290 --> 01:02:02,630
They destroyed our centre.
It's no joke.

739
01:02:05,460 --> 01:02:07,250
Sonali, hold my hand.

740
01:02:09,540 --> 01:02:12,670
- I'm cold.
- Get the doctor.

741
01:02:13,330 --> 01:02:15,750
Are you okay?
Look at me!

742
01:02:17,790 --> 01:02:18,960
Where's B.D.?

743
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:20,960
Somewhere safe.

744
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:24,540
My locket?

745
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:25,920
The nurse has it.

746
01:02:26,380 --> 01:02:28,830
Just keep talking to me.

747
01:02:31,420 --> 01:02:32,830
What wrong?
Talk to me!

748
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:34,710
Sonali. Green.

749
01:02:37,210 --> 01:02:38,290
What's green?

750
01:02:39,540 --> 01:02:40,670
It's over.

751
01:02:40,710 --> 01:02:41,580
No!

752
01:02:41,630 --> 01:02:43,380
I think I'm going offline...

753
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:49,540
Shut up rascal!
We never go offline!

754
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:51,830
- Raghu. Doctor.
- Don't leave my hand.

755
01:02:51,880 --> 01:02:53,630
Jayyu. Raghu.

756
01:02:54,420 --> 01:02:55,380
Sada. No.

757
01:02:56,750 --> 01:02:57,710
Sada.

758
01:03:08,210 --> 01:03:09,080
Raghu.

759
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:25,670
"Why has the season changed?"

760
01:03:25,960 --> 01:03:31,330
"..my heart feels a little empty."

761
01:03:31,670 --> 01:03:45,540
"Someone close has left me bereft...
..left me."

762
01:03:47,130 --> 01:03:50,880
Mr. Bobby.
We have a tiny situation.

763
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:58,500
Sweating with the AC on?
Are you ill?

764
01:04:24,460 --> 01:04:29,880
"My fate cries...
..at my life."

765
01:04:30,580 --> 01:04:35,710
"There is a wave of sadness
in every breath."

766
01:04:36,500 --> 01:04:41,920
"My fate cries...
..at my life."

767
01:04:42,330 --> 01:04:47,460
"There is a wave of sadness
in every breath."

768
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:56,630
"It feels like a illusion...
..all my dreams broken."

769
01:04:57,210 --> 01:04:59,130
Enjoy your vacation.

770
01:05:03,080 --> 01:05:15,250
"How is that I melted into...
..my own shadow."

771
01:05:16,040 --> 01:05:21,210
"I am still in shock."

772
01:05:22,290 --> 01:05:25,000
It was a mistake.
Say sorry.

773
01:05:34,210 --> 01:05:39,960
"In your heart...
..let me buy some space."

774
01:05:40,540 --> 01:05:45,960
"I can only spend on the dreams...
..which remain."

775
01:05:46,420 --> 01:05:53,630
"A little house of hope...
..come kindred spirit."

776
01:05:54,040 --> 01:06:07,580
"Stay as my companion...
..throughout this life."

777
01:06:08,380 --> 01:06:13,420
"This is what I had desired."

778
01:06:13,830 --> 01:06:19,580
'It all ended with a stroke."

779
01:06:20,080 --> 01:06:26,920
"Why has the season changed?"

780
01:06:31,170 --> 01:06:32,630
Uncle open the door.

781
01:06:33,330 --> 01:06:34,790
Uncle open the door.

782
01:06:58,580 --> 01:07:00,130
Won't you kiss him?

783
01:07:03,080 --> 01:07:04,960
It was Shining, wasn't it?

784
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:10,040
I get it.

785
01:07:10,500 --> 01:07:13,210
- They were your men.
- Stop it!

786
01:07:14,670 --> 01:07:18,420
Let it go.
It was an accident.

787
01:07:19,330 --> 01:07:21,290
Don't make the same mistake.

788
01:07:23,380 --> 01:07:24,750
Keep your head down.

789
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,420
- I'll take care of...
- Don't touch it!

790
01:07:42,080 --> 01:07:43,540
Talk to Mr. Gawde he will lok after it.

791
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:46,250
Inaamdar Sir. Any updates?

792
01:07:46,290 --> 01:07:48,380
Sonali, be patient.

793
01:07:48,710 --> 01:07:52,290
Let Meena ma'am handle it,
or it'll just get worse.

794
01:07:52,670 --> 01:07:56,290
He was just a kid.
How much worse can it get?

795
01:07:56,580 --> 01:07:58,710
A lot worse.

796
01:08:16,210 --> 01:08:20,460
My centre was attacked.
My technician was murdered.

797
01:08:20,830 --> 01:08:22,420
Won't you file a report?

798
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,210
Any suspects?

799
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:30,170
Yes. Bobby Bose from
Shining Broadband.

800
01:08:33,290 --> 01:08:34,580
Any proof?

801
01:08:41,210 --> 01:08:44,250
The case being handed over to you
is proof enough.

802
01:08:44,830 --> 01:08:51,460
Look, you're a good girl of the hood.

803
01:08:52,750 --> 01:08:54,710
So, stay that way.

804
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:59,960
I'm not such a good girl that
I can't see the filth right in front of me.

805
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,420
What do you mean?

806
01:09:01,460 --> 01:09:06,830
My free internet has
replaced your Viagra pills.

807
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:08,500
Hey Sangeeta.

808
01:09:08,540 --> 01:09:10,420
- Throw her out!
- Back off!

809
01:09:10,750 --> 01:09:13,880
Please continue.
This is Sonali's internet service.

810
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:15,290
It won't leave you limp.

811
01:09:15,880 --> 01:09:18,040
- Up your's!
- Get out before I arrest you!

812
01:09:19,540 --> 01:09:22,000
Get back to work!

813
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:26,540
Back from hiding?
You shouldn't have bothered.

814
01:09:26,580 --> 01:09:29,540
Believe me. I was locked in.

815
01:09:30,460 --> 01:09:32,380
You could've broken the door down.

816
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:35,540
And I did!

817
01:09:37,830 --> 01:09:39,130
Try to understand.

818
01:09:39,830 --> 01:09:42,420
This is totally out of our league.

819
01:09:43,250 --> 01:09:45,960
Even an ant can make an elephant
do the Disco.

820
01:09:46,330 --> 01:09:47,670
It just has to bite the right spot.

821
01:09:49,750 --> 01:09:52,500
Remember what this
rascal used to say?

822
01:10:18,130 --> 01:10:23,170
So, we have a quote from
another provider.

823
01:10:23,460 --> 01:10:25,960
The committee hasn't decided yet.

824
01:10:26,790 --> 01:10:30,130
This is impossible, Sir.
That too without an advance payment.

825
01:10:30,170 --> 01:10:31,540
We'll do it.

826
01:10:33,880 --> 01:10:35,330
Sonali.

827
01:10:38,460 --> 01:10:41,540
Within a month, your entire colony
will be WiFi-ready.

828
01:10:41,580 --> 01:10:43,500
Including the 300 new flats.

829
01:10:44,330 --> 01:10:49,130
Think before you commit.
Let us know if it's beyond you.

830
01:10:49,170 --> 01:10:55,420
Sir, you wouldn't have called us
if you didn't think we could pull it off.

831
01:10:59,630 --> 01:11:00,420
All the best.

832
01:11:09,210 --> 01:11:13,290
No bank will lend us money.
And I can't ask mom.

833
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,330
- Where do we get the money?
- I don't know.

834
01:11:17,710 --> 01:11:21,210
You're the "sword sharpener".
Figure it out.

835
01:11:34,710 --> 01:11:35,960
So, here's the deal.

836
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:39,210
We defer 3-months pay.

837
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:42,790
And work Sundays too.

838
01:11:43,380 --> 01:11:46,670
I'm selling everything I own for this.

839
01:11:47,630 --> 01:11:52,000
And as soon as we get paid,
everyone gets a 3-month bonus.

840
01:11:54,630 --> 01:11:56,330
And... a partnership.

841
01:11:56,580 --> 01:12:01,540
But we don't have time.
In or out, let me know now.

842
01:12:02,330 --> 01:12:05,380
I'm broke, so I can't put in any money.

843
01:12:06,580 --> 01:12:10,830
But I can figure something out
for the next three months.

844
01:12:11,460 --> 01:12:12,710
I'm in.

845
01:12:18,380 --> 01:12:20,420
I have a little money saved up.

846
01:12:30,540 --> 01:12:40,170
"These pennies of desires...
...these pennies of courage.'

847
01:12:46,540 --> 01:12:56,170
"These pennies of desires...
...these pennies of courage.'

848
01:12:59,330 --> 01:13:04,630
"These pennies of courage...
..of strength."

849
01:13:04,670 --> 01:13:09,830
"We twist around in rhythm...
..in courage."

850
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:17,040
"These pennies of desires...
...these pennies of courage.'

851
01:13:17,080 --> 01:13:19,540
Chanda ma'am please
this is embarrassing.

852
01:13:20,710 --> 01:13:22,040
You're our customer.

853
01:13:22,580 --> 01:13:24,500
And I'd like to remain so.

854
01:13:28,710 --> 01:13:32,420
This place is important to me.

855
01:13:37,750 --> 01:13:47,380
"These pennies of desires...
...these pennies of courage.'

856
01:13:52,080 --> 01:13:54,420
- You wanted some cash?
- Yes.

857
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:56,210
For what purpose?

858
01:13:57,250 --> 01:14:00,170
You lack the bandwidth to
handle the purpose.

859
01:14:00,580 --> 01:14:02,040
So chill.

860
01:14:03,380 --> 01:14:04,830
And thank you.

861
01:14:05,290 --> 01:14:06,290
Bandwidth...

862
01:14:16,920 --> 01:14:26,540
"Life enchants me...
..the colors of life."

863
01:14:28,210 --> 01:14:37,830
"Life frightens me...
..the burdens."

864
01:14:48,460 --> 01:14:58,080
"Time surrounds us...
..with intrigue."

865
01:14:59,790 --> 01:15:09,420
"Listen to me...
..we are formidable."

866
01:15:10,330 --> 01:15:19,960
"We are the heat of the flame...
..the smoke."

867
01:15:35,960 --> 01:15:39,040
What's this? I thought we were short.

868
01:15:39,080 --> 01:15:42,750
Just take it. The "Sword Sharpener"
always delivers.

869
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:54,080
Catch them.

870
01:15:55,670 --> 01:15:56,710
You rascal.

871
01:16:04,710 --> 01:16:05,750
Raghu.

872
01:16:09,080 --> 01:16:10,960
Call the ambulance.

873
01:16:12,420 --> 01:16:15,500
Didn't they teach you in business school...

874
01:16:15,790 --> 01:16:19,580
... that business is sweat
and a little blood too?

875
01:16:20,210 --> 01:16:21,710
Not really, Sir.

876
01:16:22,250 --> 01:16:23,750
Ok. Rosy...

877
01:16:37,460 --> 01:16:40,960
Then learn now.
Stop shitting your pants.

878
01:16:41,250 --> 01:16:45,580
Now that you've stirred the hornet's nest,
be a man and ride the heat.

879
01:16:53,250 --> 01:16:54,170
- Brother...
- Be careful.

880
01:16:54,540 --> 01:16:55,460
He's fine. Don't worry.

881
01:16:56,960 --> 01:16:58,250
Turn it from your left.

882
01:16:58,540 --> 01:16:59,830
How is he feeling now?

883
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:01,380
He is ok now.

884
01:17:01,830 --> 01:17:03,130
Brother be careful.

885
01:17:03,420 --> 01:17:04,710
Ma'am.

886
01:17:10,130 --> 01:17:11,250
I want to see him.

887
01:17:15,380 --> 01:17:16,710
Just for a minute.

888
01:17:19,380 --> 01:17:21,420
You selfish witch!

889
01:17:24,420 --> 01:17:26,790
How many more will you kill?

890
01:17:28,830 --> 01:17:31,290
If anything happens to Raghu...

891
01:17:31,710 --> 01:17:35,380
I'll make sure you beg for death.

892
01:17:35,790 --> 01:17:38,790
Get out of here!

893
01:17:57,420 --> 01:18:01,080
Sona! She insulted you?
Did she hit you?

894
01:18:02,380 --> 01:18:04,880
She reminded me of my
wretched childhood.

895
01:18:06,580 --> 01:18:08,250
Nothing I'm not used to.

896
01:18:08,540 --> 01:18:11,250
That's it! You're not going
out there on your own.

897
01:18:12,830 --> 01:18:18,210
I've come this far on my own.
Do you even realize that?

898
01:18:31,670 --> 01:18:33,710
Why isn't Jayyu answering his phone?

899
01:18:56,630 --> 01:18:59,880
What the hell, Jayyu?

900
01:19:00,250 --> 01:19:05,000
I never thought you, of all people,
would stab me in the back.

901
01:19:06,170 --> 01:19:13,040
When have you ever thought of us?
About what we wanted.

902
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:18,880
Now that you're getting ditched,
you want to partner up.

903
01:19:20,460 --> 01:19:25,750
And earlier? Remember?
You treated us like crap.

904
01:19:25,790 --> 01:19:30,790
How can you say that?
You installed our very first connection!

905
01:19:31,170 --> 01:19:34,630
I'm installing their first connection too.
The difference is...

906
01:19:34,670 --> 01:19:37,170
Four times the pay.
Weekends off.

907
01:19:37,460 --> 01:19:39,080
And this company T-shirt.

908
01:19:39,330 --> 01:19:43,170
We could have had all this too.
Raghu had it all planned out.

909
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:49,290
Sonali, does Raghu have to worry
about his meals, or pay off loans?

910
01:19:49,670 --> 01:19:51,880
Does he have to worry about
rats in his home?

911
01:19:52,670 --> 01:19:55,880
Don't dangle that carrot
in front me.

912
01:19:56,210 --> 01:19:59,460
Even his mom had to give in.
Raghu can't do shit.

913
01:20:00,790 --> 01:20:03,170
These people killed Sada.

914
01:20:03,210 --> 01:20:07,500
- Yeah, but we're alive.
- They killed Sada, Jayyu.

915
01:20:08,420 --> 01:20:12,080
Look, I can find you a job too.

916
01:20:21,290 --> 01:20:23,040
Raghu wasn't the target.

917
01:20:26,040 --> 01:20:30,250
- The hit was on the girl.
- And she means nothing?

918
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:34,920
Relax.

919
01:20:36,710 --> 01:20:41,830
Bhau, foot-soldiers like Sonali's father
helped you reach where you are.

920
01:20:43,170 --> 01:20:47,880
And now the same man's daughter
is easily dispensible? Where's the justice?

921
01:20:48,500 --> 01:20:52,420
Son, doormats exist to be stepped on.

922
01:20:53,710 --> 01:20:58,080
It's time to grow up.
Do what's necessary.

923
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:02,880
Meena, how long have you been
part of the State Assembly?

924
01:21:03,670 --> 01:21:06,630
Nine years, thanks to you.

925
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:11,000
I've done nothing.
Our party rests on your shoulders.

926
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:16,500
But, it's time to aim higher.

927
01:21:18,540 --> 01:21:21,290
I'm announcing the Lower House
candidates next week.

928
01:21:22,460 --> 01:21:26,330
I want this mess cleared by then.

929
01:21:28,460 --> 01:21:30,130
Let it go, Sonali.

930
01:21:30,830 --> 01:21:33,330
Go out on your own terms.

931
01:21:36,460 --> 01:21:37,880
Thank you.

932
01:21:44,040 --> 01:21:47,040
What do you see in her Raghu?

933
01:21:47,670 --> 01:21:50,380
Love's a bitch right?
And I'm blinded by it.

934
01:21:50,670 --> 01:21:53,830
But what about you?
What do you see in Sonali?

935
01:21:54,210 --> 01:21:58,250
She's what you were 30 years ago.
And you can't handle it!

936
01:21:58,500 --> 01:22:00,290
That's nonsense!

937
01:22:00,580 --> 01:22:04,040
- She's nothing like me.
- But she's everything to me.

938
01:22:05,420 --> 01:22:08,170
My phone and keys.

939
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:16,000
Raghu.

940
01:23:05,210 --> 01:23:10,420
Shetty, I need four technicians
urgently. Please.

941
01:23:13,830 --> 01:23:16,380
I bought the equipment with
money from Race Net.

942
01:23:18,460 --> 01:23:21,920
- Why didn't you tell me?
- You wouldn't have agreed.

943
01:23:26,710 --> 01:23:29,670
- I would've sold my home.
- It's not that simple.

944
01:23:30,040 --> 01:23:33,710
We need corporate support.
Zooni can arrange it.

945
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:38,630
- You've been seeing her again!
- Oh please, not that again.

946
01:23:38,670 --> 01:23:42,000
It's either now or never.
We're in deep shit.

947
01:23:44,920 --> 01:23:49,290
- You're not seeing her?
- No, I'm not. Trust me.

948
01:23:51,790 --> 01:23:52,710
You swear?

949
01:23:53,880 --> 01:23:54,790
I swear.

950
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,170
Try it. It's healthy.

951
01:24:22,790 --> 01:24:24,080
Healthy, huh?

952
01:24:24,130 --> 01:24:25,460
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

953
01:24:25,790 --> 01:24:28,170
No. Are you mad?

954
01:24:40,920 --> 01:24:44,670
Sonali, our investment
is not an interference.

955
01:24:45,080 --> 01:24:47,670
Nobody will come in between
you and your customers.

956
01:24:47,960 --> 01:24:49,460
That's a promise.

957
01:24:54,630 --> 01:24:57,710
- I'll read it later.
- I've already read it.

958
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:23,670
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

959
01:25:31,790 --> 01:25:37,040
As I was saying, these Shining
idiots have to pay.

960
01:25:37,290 --> 01:25:41,630
You know, how the Americans do it?
Stripping down huge corporations.

961
01:25:41,670 --> 01:25:45,710
Yes, Zooni, talk to your lawyers.
Maybe we...

962
01:25:46,040 --> 01:25:47,830
Oh my god!

963
01:25:47,880 --> 01:25:49,540
Dad, look at this.

964
01:25:51,790 --> 01:25:54,210
As I was saying,
these Shining idiots...

965
01:25:56,670 --> 01:25:59,080
We don't need to worry about Shining.

966
01:25:59,130 --> 01:26:00,460
What are you talking about?

967
01:26:00,500 --> 01:26:03,670
I've just got a text from Singapore.
It's really, really good news guys.

968
01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:05,500
Zooni what good news?

969
01:26:05,830 --> 01:26:07,500
Our parent company and
Shining have entered...

970
01:26:07,540 --> 01:26:12,080
... into a strategic partnership.

971
01:26:12,710 --> 01:26:15,130
So, technically,
we are all part of Shining.

972
01:26:15,420 --> 01:26:18,000
What the hell is she saying, Raghu?

973
01:26:18,040 --> 01:26:21,880
Race Net has been bought by Shining...

974
01:26:21,920 --> 01:26:26,080
So now our customers will get the best
broadband service out there.

975
01:26:26,420 --> 01:26:32,080
- Shining Broadband?
- They are the major partner, so... yes.

976
01:26:32,670 --> 01:26:36,460
And you're the
major partner in my company.

977
01:26:36,710 --> 01:26:38,460
Well... yes.

978
01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:40,460
No.

979
01:26:41,210 --> 01:26:43,830
Zooni, you did not tell me about any of this.

980
01:26:43,880 --> 01:26:44,880
I did not signed up for this.

981
01:26:45,130 --> 01:26:46,790
I just found out myself!

982
01:26:47,080 --> 01:26:50,250
I can't believe you sold Sonali Cable
out to Shining behind my back!

983
01:26:50,290 --> 01:26:51,500
But I did not know about it.

984
01:27:26,290 --> 01:27:27,670
Here's your Oscar.

985
01:27:28,420 --> 01:27:30,710
Did you study business
in America or acting?

986
01:27:30,960 --> 01:27:32,790
Or are they the same?

987
01:27:33,330 --> 01:27:35,210
I had no idea, Sonali.

988
01:27:35,670 --> 01:27:38,130
- But I did.
- What did you know?

989
01:27:38,170 --> 01:27:42,540
That you too would stab me in the back.

990
01:27:42,790 --> 01:27:45,670
I love you.

991
01:27:46,670 --> 01:27:48,580
You're so full of shit.

992
01:27:54,330 --> 01:28:00,080
If only my dad had been there for me,
I'd have gone to college like you.

993
01:28:01,580 --> 01:28:07,790
I swear on my slut of a mother,
I would have seen this coming.

994
01:28:10,790 --> 01:28:12,330
You rascal.

995
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:27,880
Bhau Rao has announced...

996
01:28:27,920 --> 01:28:31,210
... his party's candidates for
Lower House elections.

997
01:28:31,880 --> 01:28:33,630
The names on the list have surprised...

998
01:28:33,670 --> 01:28:35,630
... political experts across the country.

999
01:28:36,790 --> 01:28:37,710
Meena ma'am.

1000
01:28:40,130 --> 01:28:43,630
Tell that Bhau if he doesn't
give election ticket...

1001
01:28:43,670 --> 01:28:46,330
I sacrificed everything for the party.

1002
01:28:47,580 --> 01:28:51,670
I did so much for Bhau.

1003
01:28:54,080 --> 01:28:58,250
Instead of nominating me,
he kicked me out of the State Assembly.

1004
01:28:58,580 --> 01:29:00,920
Do you still think
Bhau is calling the shots?

1005
01:29:01,330 --> 01:29:04,330
He's nothing but Shining's puppet.

1006
01:29:05,040 --> 01:29:07,420
Just like you, they broke Sonali.

1007
01:29:09,630 --> 01:29:10,460
And me too.

1008
01:29:13,830 --> 01:29:18,580
No, son.
They can't break you so easily.

1009
01:29:20,250 --> 01:29:22,330
I won't let them.

1010
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:27,500
Your turn.

1011
01:29:37,130 --> 01:29:43,130
Bobby. Still at "almost" or
do we have the whole of Mumbai?

1012
01:29:43,460 --> 01:29:47,960
It's the last phase, Sir.
Another few days.

1013
01:29:49,420 --> 01:29:51,130
You've changed, Bobby.

1014
01:29:51,880 --> 01:29:52,830
What sir?

1015
01:29:54,420 --> 01:29:59,670
You avoid looking me in the eye,
like a petty pickpocket.

1016
01:30:00,500 --> 01:30:03,420
- What's the matter?
- Nothing at all, Sir.

1017
01:30:06,080 --> 01:30:08,540
It's definitely something.

1018
01:30:14,460 --> 01:30:15,790
Checkmate!

1019
01:30:19,250 --> 01:30:23,080
I'm the only one
who can beat me at my game.

1020
01:30:28,710 --> 01:30:33,630
You dare laugh at me?

1021
01:30:56,130 --> 01:30:57,080
Mr. Bobby.

1022
01:31:20,500 --> 01:31:23,540
I don't want bail.
I'm going back in.

1023
01:31:24,210 --> 01:31:27,170
You're lucky I'm back.
Sign here.

1024
01:31:30,830 --> 01:31:33,170
Don't leave Mumbai
till this is over.

1025
01:31:33,500 --> 01:31:36,210
Are you kidding?
I'll never leave Mumbai.

1026
01:31:36,250 --> 01:31:39,580
And neither will the city leave me.

1027
01:31:40,420 --> 01:31:42,420
- Let's go, dad.
- I'll be right out.

1028
01:31:48,630 --> 01:31:49,670
Sonali.

1029
01:31:50,040 --> 01:31:51,080
Hear me out.

1030
01:31:55,960 --> 01:31:57,960
Who ordered the hit on my daughter?

1031
01:31:58,750 --> 01:32:01,830
Inamdaar. Tell me.

1032
01:32:16,960 --> 01:32:21,080
Can we at least talk?
Just for an hour.

1033
01:32:21,500 --> 01:32:27,500
An hour? I had given you my life.

1034
01:32:44,670 --> 01:32:45,380
Let's go.

1035
01:32:45,420 --> 01:32:46,460
Sonali.

1036
01:32:46,960 --> 01:32:50,500
I was just saying
come home this evening.

1037
01:32:50,540 --> 01:32:52,790
Let's talk about you and Raghu.

1038
01:32:53,380 --> 01:32:56,460
But I thought we were siblings.

1039
01:32:56,750 --> 01:32:58,830
Talk to her.

1040
01:32:59,130 --> 01:33:00,040
Let's go.

1041
01:33:04,580 --> 01:33:10,750
I've never seen him sober before.
We should do something about it.

1042
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:14,000
We reap what we sow.

1043
01:33:14,630 --> 01:33:18,460
Let's not make things worse.

1044
01:33:28,460 --> 01:33:30,250
You're drinking tea?

1045
01:33:31,170 --> 01:33:32,250
I've quit.

1046
01:33:35,460 --> 01:33:38,330
I've quit using your mother
as an excuse.

1047
01:33:39,040 --> 01:33:40,250
Just like that?

1048
01:33:41,880 --> 01:33:45,460
Sona, your mother didn't
abandon you.

1049
01:33:47,040 --> 01:33:48,920
I took you from her.

1050
01:33:49,420 --> 01:33:50,380
Why?

1051
01:33:51,670 --> 01:33:57,130
She used to say, "Datta, you stink
more of blood than booze.

1052
01:33:57,710 --> 01:33:59,580
Give up this life."

1053
01:34:01,460 --> 01:34:05,250
But... I gave her up.

1054
01:34:06,290 --> 01:34:07,580
Where's mom?

1055
01:34:12,330 --> 01:34:14,250
She killed herself.

1056
01:34:23,290 --> 01:34:25,210
Welcome to Shining broadband.

1057
01:34:25,580 --> 01:34:27,330
We are happy to help you.

1058
01:34:27,380 --> 01:34:29,750
Your call is important to us.

1059
01:34:33,420 --> 01:34:34,330
Sonali...

1060
01:34:35,170 --> 01:34:38,250
Their helpline doesn't help at all.

1061
01:34:38,580 --> 01:34:41,330
I get the same voice on every number.

1062
01:34:41,670 --> 01:34:45,250
"Press 1 for Hindi, Press 2 for English."

1063
01:34:45,500 --> 01:34:48,080
Nobody listens to us.

1064
01:34:48,330 --> 01:34:53,000
And then they ask me to
file a complaint online.

1065
01:34:53,500 --> 01:34:58,250
Your broadband was best.
Don't leave.

1066
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:07,000
I can't help you.
I've lost everything.

1067
01:35:51,080 --> 01:35:57,420
The people of India and
the Shining Group are lovers.

1068
01:35:58,330 --> 01:36:02,420
And when a third person comes between us
it's just not very enjoyable.

1069
01:36:02,790 --> 01:36:06,790
Narayan Vaghela was born
in a small village where his mother...

1070
01:36:06,830 --> 01:36:10,130
...supported the family by making"Khakhras".

1071
01:36:10,790 --> 01:36:12,000
Mr. Vaghela believes...

1072
01:36:12,290 --> 01:36:15,670
It is... a love story, dear.

1073
01:36:16,330 --> 01:36:17,380
Love story.

1074
01:36:23,790 --> 01:36:24,830
Rosy.

1075
01:36:26,130 --> 01:36:31,750
A $2,500 drink for Madhavan, a $2,500 drink
for Bobby and a $2,500 drink for me.

1076
01:36:32,040 --> 01:36:35,000
To "all of" Mumbai!

1077
01:36:35,250 --> 01:36:41,330
And to Bobby's nose,
which is now "almost" a nose!

1078
01:37:31,750 --> 01:37:35,670
Hey B.D. So how did you become
such a computer whiz?

1079
01:37:35,710 --> 01:37:40,250
Sada. I was a hacker in Bangladesh.

1080
01:37:40,290 --> 01:37:46,000
I can break into any system
and wreak havoc.

1081
01:37:46,040 --> 01:37:50,080
You might come in handy some day.
Have you told Sonali?

1082
01:37:50,130 --> 01:37:54,420
Hell, no! I don't want any trouble.

1083
01:37:54,460 --> 01:37:57,960
I just want to lay low
and settle down with Jabbo.

1084
01:37:58,500 --> 01:38:02,210
And I don't want to lose friends like you.

1085
01:38:06,130 --> 01:38:07,420
You call yourself a friend?

1086
01:38:07,750 --> 01:38:09,880
Sonali? How did you find us?

1087
01:38:10,170 --> 01:38:13,380
Sada sent me.
Whom you abandoned.

1088
01:38:15,500 --> 01:38:19,380
He was like a brother to me.
But I got scared.

1089
01:38:19,790 --> 01:38:21,580
They're too big for us to take on.

1090
01:38:21,960 --> 01:38:27,290
B.D. If they are the big tree,
then we are a small axe.

1091
01:38:48,460 --> 01:38:50,080
B.D. Can you see me?

1092
01:39:33,500 --> 01:39:35,920
I worked like a dog for madam's party.

1093
01:39:36,500 --> 01:39:41,460
The stones I threw, the buses I burnt,
remember?

1094
01:39:41,500 --> 01:39:42,540
Come to the point.

1095
01:39:42,580 --> 01:39:46,920
The balls you have, to put
a hit out on my daughter!

1096
01:39:46,960 --> 01:39:50,000
Raghu is the one who was hit.

1097
01:39:50,290 --> 01:39:52,040
Thanks to Sonali.

1098
01:39:52,330 --> 01:39:55,540
Is that why Meena ma'am
wants her to marry her son?

1099
01:39:55,790 --> 01:39:58,710
Being sober doesn't suit you.

1100
01:39:59,130 --> 01:40:02,750
You're damn right!

1101
01:40:31,040 --> 01:40:34,710
Sonali, Raghu called.
He wants to help.

1102
01:40:35,170 --> 01:40:37,580
So he can betray me again?

1103
01:40:37,630 --> 01:40:42,330
I'll do anything for my brother.
If only he were alive...

1104
01:40:42,380 --> 01:40:45,920
Sada is alive, and very much
a part of our plan.

1105
01:40:45,960 --> 01:40:50,960
You'll have only ten minutes to
execute the plan. Hit 'em hard!

1106
01:40:51,330 --> 01:40:56,540
I'm with you on this. But you can do
this without breaking the law.

1107
01:40:57,420 --> 01:41:03,380
Have you ever seen an elephant
dance to an ant's tune?

1108
01:41:04,580 --> 01:41:08,790
Neither have I.
But I will tomorrow.

1109
01:41:42,040 --> 01:41:44,960
- Thanks B.D. see you soon.
- See you.

1110
01:41:55,540 --> 01:41:56,580
Excuse me.

1111
01:42:02,250 --> 01:42:05,080
Costable Sonali Tandel, Mumbai police.
Bomb squad.

1112
01:42:05,380 --> 01:42:06,460
Bomb squad?

1113
01:42:06,500 --> 01:42:10,170
Just a routine check.
She's one of ours.

1114
01:42:25,380 --> 01:42:27,210
Hello! Do you have an appointment?

1115
01:42:27,250 --> 01:42:30,040
- I have a bomb!
- What? Stop!

1116
01:42:31,330 --> 01:42:32,380
Hello, security.

1117
01:42:53,380 --> 01:42:54,670
Where's the girl?

1118
01:42:55,670 --> 01:42:58,960
A girl here?
Haven't seen one in ages.

1119
01:43:23,250 --> 01:43:23,830
Who the hell are you?

1120
01:43:24,420 --> 01:43:26,000
I'm Sonali Dattaram Tandel.

1121
01:43:26,420 --> 01:43:27,000
Tandel.

1122
01:43:27,880 --> 01:43:29,080
How'd you get up here?

1123
01:43:30,290 --> 01:43:33,500
I walked right in.

1124
01:43:33,880 --> 01:43:35,380
What do you want?

1125
01:43:36,630 --> 01:43:40,580
I am jobless, you took it away.

1126
01:43:42,750 --> 01:43:46,130
So I figured, I'd swing by and...

1127
01:43:46,830 --> 01:43:48,210
...blow you up!

1128
01:43:48,460 --> 01:43:50,880
Sit down!
There's some time.

1129
01:43:50,920 --> 01:43:51,500
You sit.

1130
01:43:52,670 --> 01:43:53,250
You sit.

1131
01:43:54,460 --> 01:43:55,710
Have a seat.

1132
01:43:58,750 --> 01:44:02,330
I never imagined I'd even be
able to stand in front of you.

1133
01:44:02,380 --> 01:44:06,790
You were my hero once.

1134
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,630
And now? A big Zero?

1135
01:44:11,040 --> 01:44:12,330
Lesser!

1136
01:44:12,880 --> 01:44:15,670
Just because you couldn't
control your business.

1137
01:44:15,920 --> 01:44:19,290
Just because you couldn't
control your greed.

1138
01:44:20,750 --> 01:44:23,210
Greed defines business.

1139
01:44:23,250 --> 01:44:27,000
Sorry Sir.
Customers define business.

1140
01:44:27,040 --> 01:44:32,460
You should know better.
What with this huge empire of yours.

1141
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:34,330
But I can't blame you.

1142
01:44:35,170 --> 01:44:36,880
You're all about
one-night-stands.

1143
01:44:38,580 --> 01:44:44,170
Like those guys who hit on girls,
and tell them they love them.

1144
01:44:44,420 --> 01:44:47,830
And once they use them,
they won't even take their calls.

1145
01:44:48,130 --> 01:44:49,790
You get it, right, girl?

1146
01:44:50,670 --> 01:44:53,460
Your "love story" is similar.

1147
01:44:54,130 --> 01:44:57,830
Once the customer is in your bed,
what choice is he left with?

1148
01:44:58,420 --> 01:45:01,920
He keeps punching numbers
to a robotic voice.

1149
01:45:01,960 --> 01:45:04,960
And is forced to pay fat bills.
And what do you do about it?

1150
01:45:05,460 --> 01:45:08,540
You enjoy your Khakhras.

1151
01:45:09,960 --> 01:45:13,960
Go on kid. Let it all out.
I'll humor you.

1152
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:15,830
Don't touch it!

1153
01:45:25,460 --> 01:45:31,460
Shining Khakhra. The only Khakhra
every Indian must eat.

1154
01:45:31,710 --> 01:45:33,630
Enjoy.

1155
01:45:33,880 --> 01:45:39,420
The other Khakhra is made by
an old woman in her home.

1156
01:45:40,080 --> 01:45:43,000
Like your mother used to.

1157
01:45:45,750 --> 01:45:47,250
And your point is?

1158
01:45:47,670 --> 01:45:56,880
That both, your mother and I just
wanted to earn a living.

1159
01:45:57,500 --> 01:45:59,210
We're the same person.

1160
01:46:00,210 --> 01:46:01,540
And you...

1161
01:46:02,960 --> 01:46:04,540
You finished me!

1162
01:46:23,080 --> 01:46:26,290
Think about it.
What does that make you?

1163
01:46:31,750 --> 01:46:32,790
What do you want?

1164
01:46:33,130 --> 01:46:34,670
Answer me!

1165
01:46:35,040 --> 01:46:37,250
What on earth do you want?

1166
01:46:37,290 --> 01:46:40,290
Everyone dances to your tune.
Now, it's your turn.

1167
01:46:41,670 --> 01:46:45,960
I'm the ant that'll make
you do the Disco.

1168
01:46:46,580 --> 01:46:48,750
This is for Sada.

1169
01:46:53,380 --> 01:46:54,750
Bobby you b*****.

1170
01:46:55,170 --> 01:46:58,790
You swindled millions from
Shining while buying Race Net.

1171
01:46:59,040 --> 01:47:02,670
If Vaghela finds out,
what will he do with you?

1172
01:47:02,710 --> 01:47:06,170
Zooni, Vaghela greenlit the hit on Sonali.

1173
01:47:07,040 --> 01:47:11,080
And this isn't his first hit. He's made
many such problems disappear.

1174
01:47:11,750 --> 01:47:16,920
Nobody can touch him. He's got cops
politicians and the media in his pocket.

1175
01:47:17,330 --> 01:47:23,540
But I have Vaghela in my pocket.
I have proof of all his illegal activities.

1176
01:47:25,170 --> 01:47:30,880
Bhau. If one fights back,
ten more will follow.

1177
01:47:30,920 --> 01:47:33,830
No Vaghela. I'll handle Sonali Tandel.

1178
01:47:33,880 --> 01:47:38,880
Enough of handling. Just kill her!
Bobby will take care of the money.

1179
01:47:39,420 --> 01:47:40,540
Long live Maharashtra.

1180
01:47:47,250 --> 01:47:48,500
So, this is your "bomb"?

1181
01:47:48,540 --> 01:47:52,040
Just a sparkler.
You'll hear the fireworks soon.

1182
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:57,250
And I dare you
to put a hit out on me again.

1183
01:47:57,960 --> 01:48:02,040
Watch your back.
Because this video is already on YouTube.

1184
01:48:03,710 --> 01:48:06,420
- This is not true.
- Oh, it's not true?

1185
01:48:06,880 --> 01:48:11,880
Don't send your lap dogs
after me next time.

1186
01:48:11,920 --> 01:48:15,460
Step in the ring yourself.
I'm waiting.

1187
01:48:15,750 --> 01:48:19,540
You'll never have all of Mumbai
to yourself.

1188
01:48:20,790 --> 01:48:23,170
Hey kid! Wait up.

1189
01:48:29,290 --> 01:48:34,920
Work for me.
You'll control all of Mumbai.

1190
01:48:35,380 --> 01:48:39,710
Mumbai can control itself.
You better prepare for the lawsuits.

1191
01:48:40,040 --> 01:48:44,210
You've messed with the common man.
And he is very angry.

1192
01:48:52,670 --> 01:48:54,170
Don't touch her.

1193
01:48:54,630 --> 01:48:56,040
Let her go.

1194
01:48:56,080 --> 01:48:59,170
You let her walk in like she owns the place
and now you want to be heroes?

1195
01:48:59,670 --> 01:49:01,130
Morons!

1196
01:49:20,380 --> 01:49:23,460
This is the beginning of your end.

1197
01:49:25,460 --> 01:49:26,040
Out.

1198
01:49:26,790 --> 01:49:27,380
Get out.

1199
01:49:28,210 --> 01:49:28,790
Move.

1200
01:49:34,420 --> 01:49:35,000
Madhavan.

1201
01:49:36,670 --> 01:49:37,250
Sir.

1202
01:49:38,330 --> 01:49:40,460
This thing...You...Tube...

1203
01:49:40,500 --> 01:49:41,080
Yes, YouTube sir.

1204
01:49:42,630 --> 01:49:44,040
Buy it.

1205
01:49:49,830 --> 01:49:53,380
I've got a huge mortgage to pay.

1206
01:49:53,790 --> 01:49:54,580
So do I.

1207
01:49:54,920 --> 01:49:57,960
Which is why
I prefer playing defense.

1208
01:49:58,380 --> 01:50:02,130
Will I get blacklisted?
Arrested?

1209
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:04,580
- Or...
- Anything can happen.

1210
01:50:05,080 --> 01:50:10,460
After all, it's a love story, dear.

1211
01:50:10,830 --> 01:50:13,830
Why did Mr. Vaghela want
to meet so urgently?

1212
01:50:15,210 --> 01:50:17,250
By the way nice tattoo.

1213
01:50:17,790 --> 01:50:18,380
What?

1214
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:29,080
What's there to explain?

1215
01:50:29,380 --> 01:50:30,880
It's all in this file.

1216
01:50:31,830 --> 01:50:34,210
This will kick up quite a storm.

1217
01:50:34,250 --> 01:50:37,540
Do you think Sonali Tandel had a
hand in Meena Pawar's expose?

1218
01:50:37,580 --> 01:50:42,710
That bitch and her drunk father.
They can't touch a hair on my head!

1219
01:50:43,170 --> 01:50:45,460
Looks like Sonali hit a nerve.

1220
01:50:45,920 --> 01:50:46,580
Shut up.

1221
01:50:47,080 --> 01:50:48,830
Hey you turn of the camera.

1222
01:50:49,170 --> 01:50:50,960
Otherwise I will break it.

1223
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:56,420
Every common but fearless girl,
exposes corrupt politicians.

1224
01:50:57,000 --> 01:51:01,250
A video named sonali leaks
goes viral on all social networks sites.

1225
01:51:02,580 --> 01:51:07,630
After Sonali Tandel's shocking
expose of Shining Corp's illegal activities...

1226
01:51:07,920 --> 01:51:14,040
...the company's chairman Mr. Vaghela
was taken into police custody.

1227
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,460
Shining Broadband's license
has now been suspended.

1228
01:51:23,880 --> 01:51:29,250
This comes as good news for small
entrepreneurs fighting corporate greed.

1229
01:52:08,790 --> 01:52:10,080
Any word from Raghu?

1230
01:52:10,540 --> 01:52:12,130
No news is best news.

1231
01:52:22,380 --> 01:52:24,040
Who's the rookie?

1232
01:52:24,080 --> 01:52:26,750
No idea. Jayyu brought him.

1233
01:52:27,040 --> 01:52:31,040
Without asking me?
He'll get us into deep shit again.

1234
01:52:32,830 --> 01:52:35,130
What the hell!
Who did you hire now?

1235
01:52:36,460 --> 01:52:39,040
You? What are you doing here?

1236
01:52:39,080 --> 01:52:41,080
Never question the "sword sharpener".

1237
01:52:42,130 --> 01:52:43,420
Dear Sonali.

1238
01:52:43,830 --> 01:52:50,920
Some connections never go offline.

1239
01:52:51,960 --> 01:52:53,250
Every well said sir.

1240
01:52:54,630 --> 01:52:57,960
- Let go.
- Look at me.

1241
01:53:02,170 --> 01:53:06,880
Do you believe me now?
I had no idea what Zooni was up to.

1242
01:53:08,290 --> 01:53:09,960
So what do you want now?

1243
01:53:10,920 --> 01:53:14,670
Same thing you do.
Partnership.

1244
01:53:17,130 --> 01:53:18,790
Fifty- fifty.

1245
01:53:29,670 --> 01:53:31,330
Will you marry me?

1246
01:53:32,580 --> 01:53:35,790
First, go shave!

1247
01:53:44,540 --> 01:53:46,790
Do we ever go offline?

1248
01:53:55,830 --> 01:53:58,080
"Ant ant ant."

1249
01:53:59,380 --> 01:54:01,630
"Ant ant ant."

1250
01:54:17,080 --> 01:54:20,420
"Don’t underestimate this little ant...
..give it a chance."

1251
01:54:20,880 --> 01:54:24,210
"Its is tiny but such a charmer."

1252
01:54:24,460 --> 01:54:27,830
"But if you mess with it...
..you will get what you deserve."

1253
01:54:27,880 --> 01:54:30,170
"Once an ant gets in..."

1254
01:54:31,500 --> 01:54:34,210
"..it can make an elephant dance."

1255
01:54:34,790 --> 01:54:38,210
"A sway here...
..ant ant bang bang."

1256
01:54:38,540 --> 01:54:41,960
"A sway there...
..ant ant bang bang."

1257
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:45,000
"Its gonna get tough...
.. ant ant bang bang."

1258
01:54:45,250 --> 01:54:49,380
"What are you gonna do...
.. ant ant bang bang."

1259
01:55:31,790 --> 01:55:35,210
"In this crazy world...
..nothing matters."

1260
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:40,250
"Whether one is poor
or filthy rich."

1261
01:55:42,290 --> 01:55:45,540
"The valiant survive
and the cowards die."

1262
01:55:48,670 --> 01:55:51,920
"An ant can climb a mountain
and an elephant can dance."

1263
01:55:53,710 --> 01:55:57,130
"A sway here..."

1264
01:56:00,880 --> 01:56:04,130
"A sway here...
..ant ant bang bang."

1265
01:56:04,540 --> 01:56:07,790
"A sway there...
..ant ant bang bang."

1266
01:56:08,170 --> 01:56:11,170
"Its gonna get tough...
.. ant ant bang bang."

1267
01:56:11,420 --> 01:56:15,250
"What are you gonna do...
.. ant ant bang bang."

1268
01:56:15,290 --> 01:56:18,540
"A sway here...
..ant ant bang bang."

1269
01:56:18,960 --> 01:56:22,290
"A sway there...
..ant ant bang bang."

1270
01:56:22,330 --> 01:56:25,330
"Its gonna get tough...
.. ant ant bang bang."

1271
01:56:25,630 --> 01:56:29,420
"What are you gonna do...
.. ant ant bang bang."
