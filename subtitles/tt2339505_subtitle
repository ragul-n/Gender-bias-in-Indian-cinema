1
00:02:13,041 --> 00:02:17,458
Many centuries ago, in the southern most region of Indian sub-continent...

2
00:02:17,958 --> 00:02:23,750
there flourished two powerful kingdoms, Kottaipattinam and Kalingapuri.

3
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:27,250
In their power-hungry struggle to attain supremacy...

4
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,458
these two kingdoms faced many bloodthirsty battlefields.

5
00:02:30,958 --> 00:02:34,916
In this epic saga of courage, bravery and betrayal...

6
00:02:35,416 --> 00:02:37,416
an treacherous incident unfolded...

7
00:02:37,916 --> 00:02:44,000
Which not only stained the pages of history and froze in time.

8
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:48,000
After that fateful incident...

9
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:03,666
Rana! Listen to me, Brother. Stop. Stop, Rana

10
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:37,791
Father

11
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:10,500
"The Sun burns unselfishly"

12
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
"Hence everyone gets light"

13
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:22,250
"O warrior, you fight altruistically"

14
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:27,416
"To keep our motherland safe"

15
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:34,583
"To keep our motherland safe"

16
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:37,458
"O warrior"

17
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:42,791
"O warrior"

18
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:47,791
"You know your duty"

19
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:51,791
"O warrior"

20
00:04:58,125 --> 00:05:03,000
"When victorious, don't feel proud"

21
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:08,291
"When you face defeat, don't let it stop you"

22
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:13,708
"This battlefield is your field of labor

23
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:19,000
"Keep it decorated"

24
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:24,291
"Never attack the innocent"

25
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:29,708
"Fight those who fights with you"

26
00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:35,041
"Don't let your ego interfere"

27
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:40,291
"Fight righteously"

28
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:45,625
"These winds, never stop"

29
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:51,250
"O warrior, you never tire"

30
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:56,083
"If truth is what your identity is"

31
00:05:56,583 --> 00:06:00,958
"Then a lie holds no power"

32
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:04,833
Falling into the cascading falls of Kottaipattinam...

33
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:07,375
crossing many days and nations...

34
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:11,583
The place where the young boy Rana landed, was Kalingapuri.

35
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:14,458
Becoming one among the orphan lads of that nation...

36
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:18,250
Rana with his cleverness managed himself a place in the..

37
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,416
..tough war training barracks of Kalingapuri

38
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:23,750
He transformed himself into an unvanquished, audacious...

39
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,125
..warrior par excellence...

40
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:28,291
and won many battles.

41
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:33,458
With time, the might of Rana's sword increased.

42
00:06:33,958 --> 00:06:34,875
Your majesty...

43
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:39,083
The royal council has unanimously decided...

44
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:43,166
that only Rana is worthy of being the kingdom's commander-in-chief.

45
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:46,833
From a very early age, I have known Rana's talent very well.

46
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:52,458
I agree whole-heartedly that Rana should be made commander-in-chief of Kalingapuri.

47
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:56,458
Summon Rana!

48
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:46,375
"It's time to dream..."

49
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:55,916
"It's time to dream..."

50
00:07:56,416 --> 00:07:59,916
"It's time to win"

51
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:17,666
"It's time to dream..."

52
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:21,000
"It's time to win"

53
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,416
"The blue sky invites you, touch it."

54
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:28,125
"You are a shinning star"

55
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:34,416
"We shall wake the dormant universe"

56
00:08:34,916 --> 00:08:43,250
"The knell of victory will be played in the heart"

57
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:49,958
"Use your sword, to conquer "

58
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:56,208
"Use your fate to charm the nation"

59
00:08:56,708 --> 00:09:02,958
"Courage, our wall, will help us establish dharma..."

60
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:10,041
"Like lightening speed, we'll reach the sky"

61
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:13,291
"If the forests stop us, we shall blow as a gale"

62
00:09:13,791 --> 00:09:19,416
"If the obstructions stop us, we shall be winds"

63
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:22,750
"You're the future."

64
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:29,833
"Play the knell of victory, win over everyone"

65
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:33,833
"Being the reason of happiness, find a place in the heart"

66
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
"It's time to dream..."

67
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,125
"It's time to win"

68
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:51,666
"The blue sky invites you, touch it."

69
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:55,666
"You are a shinning star"

70
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:28,833
"This is your army, you are their commander"

71
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:32,250
"Tiger's eyes, rest is the chain."

72
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:35,375
"Chain.."

73
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:38,583
"You're the bravest of all."

74
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:41,875
"You're the future."

75
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:48,625
"If ego interferes, it will be defeated"

76
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:57,375
"Before love, we shall bow our head"

77
00:10:57,875 --> 00:11:04,166
"The knell of victory will be played in the heart"

78
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:08,166
"Use your sword, to conquer. Use your fate to charm the nation "

79
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:17,333
"It's time to dream..."

80
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:20,500
"It's time to win"

81
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
"The blue sky invites you, touch it."

82
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,458
"You are a shinning star"

83
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:34,208
"We shall wake the dormant universe"

84
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:38,208
"The knell of victory will be played in the heart"

85
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:02,541
Come, Rana, Come.

86
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:07,666
From this day forward, I proclaim...

87
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:11,916
that Rana Ranvijay will take charge as the commander-in-chief of Kalingapuri.

88
00:12:12,416 --> 00:12:14,375
I declare this with pride. -Thank you, your majesty.

89
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:18,375
Long live our commander-in-chief Rana!

90
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,375
My very own friend is my nation's commander-in-chief.

91
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:36,375
Do you know how happy I feel to utter these words?

92
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:40,166
I am sure you will eliminate the weakness of our nation

93
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:43,666
But do you know the true strength of our nation?

94
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:47,666
Come, I will show you.

95
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:59,541
Such a vast gold mine, right below the palace!

96
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:01,875
How is it, in all these years, I never saw any of this?

97
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:04,833
This place is known only to the most important royal officials.

98
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:07,083
Do you know Why I have never revealed it to you?

99
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:11,083
Because the nation more important Than friendship.

100
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:19,333
Stop there. Can't you hear me?

101
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:20,291
Make haste

102
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:22,583
Lazy! Make haste

103
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:25,583
A lot needs to be done. Come on

104
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:29,583
What are you doing? Make haste

105
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:40,000
All these men that you see are our prisoners of war....

106
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:44,750
The maximum number of slaves among them, belong to Kottaipattinam.

107
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:49,791
They are the main reason, our nation's economy prospers.

108
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:54,833
Food... They are serving food

109
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:59,750
Muthaiyaa - Vardha

110
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,458
Vardha, get up. Hurry up.

111
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:06,916
Where are they all running? -They are running to eat their food

112
00:14:07,416 --> 00:14:09,166
Why should they run like this, for that?

113
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:14,708
We only provide them food once in a day. That is why.

114
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:17,666
For me!

115
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:20,458
For people who do all this hard labour, only one meal a day?

116
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:25,208
If we give slaves more than that, they will forget their duty.

117
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:28,625
I have an idea.

118
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:31,708
What if, we enlist all those slaves in our nation's army?

119
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:33,208
What are you blathering?

120
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:38,000
if we position those slaves in the frontline...

121
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:42,000
won't it lessen the life loss of our warriors?

122
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:48,458
When our army strength increases...

123
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:50,666
we can win over our enemies easily.

124
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:53,833
We can then append all their wealth to our nation's treasury...

125
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:58,833
our nation will prosper some more?

126
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:05,708
Then, this Kalingapuri will transform into a superpower, feared by one and all.

127
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:10,833
But, will slaves from an enemy nation fight for our nation?

128
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:13,625
For just one meal, they are running so desperately.

129
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:16,250
Provide them three meals a day and see for yourself.

130
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,375
I will secure permission from the king.

131
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:22,375
You go ahead and implement your plan. -Thank you

132
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:57,875
For winning over many, many small nations and making Kalingapuri, a superpower...

133
00:18:58,375 --> 00:19:00,458
Rana Ranvijay, I laud you!

134
00:19:00,958 --> 00:19:03,333
Long live Rana!

135
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:06,250
This royal medallion now belongs to you.

136
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:10,375
You have raised my throne to great heights, Rana.

137
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:13,958
What is the prize you seek? Ask away

138
00:19:14,458 --> 00:19:19,000
Kottaipattinam

139
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,500
These minor conquests mean very less to us.

140
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,166
Conquering Kottaipattinam is what will bring glory to Kalingapuri.

141
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:27,750
Grant me permission to lead and accomplish this, your majesty.

142
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,208
Commander, have you really thought over this?

143
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:33,666
The reason our army is strong today is because of Kottaipattinam's slaves.

144
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:36,208
Why will they fight against their own nation?

145
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:37,541
Beg your pardon, crown prince...

146
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:39,166
It is not their nation anymore.

147
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:42,958
It is an enemy nation that abandoned them as slaves.

148
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:47,458
For a long time, they have been raging to live with their families.

149
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:52,000
Now their rage be quenched, only on winning over Kottaipattinam.

150
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,666
Not just for them...

151
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:55,458
for us too, your majesty.

152
00:19:55,958 --> 00:20:00,666
Warriors, shall we defeat Kottaipattinam which has abandoned you as slaves?

153
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:03,958
We will defeat them! We will defeat Kottaipattinam!

154
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:07,958
So, shall we wage a war? -Let us wage a war!

155
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:22,333
Let us wage a war!

156
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:24,666
Let us capture Kottaipattinam!

157
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:28,666
Let us wage a war!

158
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:48,333
Minister, message from Kalingapuri's King Mahendra Raj.

159
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:58,458
Salutations to Ripudhaman, King of Kottaipattinam.

160
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:03,083
The auspicious day, we have been expecting for a long time, is about to arrive.

161
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:11,791
We announce proudly that we are ready to wage war on your nation.

162
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:15,208
Brave soldiers, who guard Kottaipattinam's honor!

163
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:19,458
Last month, although we won in the war against Shaktinagar...

164
00:21:19,958 --> 00:21:21,250
but unfortunately...

165
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:25,750
we lost our great commander-in-chief, Ajit Varman.

166
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:29,375
Biding his time, thinking this is the opportune moment...

167
00:21:29,875 --> 00:21:37,833
our arch enemy, Kalingapuri's King Mahendra Raj has waged war on our nation.

168
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:42,291
To teach him a lesson... to wage war against his nation...

169
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:48,166
as your leader... as Kottaipattinam's commander-in-chief...

170
00:21:48,666 --> 00:21:52,166
I hereby instate the crown prince, my son, Udhaybhaan.

171
00:23:22,583 --> 00:23:26,083
Rana

172
00:23:43,583 --> 00:23:47,083
My friend

173
00:23:49,041 --> 00:23:52,541
How many years it has been, my friend

174
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:00,291
He is my best friend

175
00:24:00,791 --> 00:24:02,375
These are my people

176
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:06,666
Kottaipattinam is my motherland

177
00:24:07,166 --> 00:24:09,541
You, who lived as slaves in Kalingapuri, all these years...

178
00:24:10,041 --> 00:24:11,750
O warriors from Kottaipattinam!

179
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:13,958
come on, this side!

180
00:24:14,458 --> 00:24:16,875
We have been waiting for many years, just for this.

181
00:24:17,375 --> 00:24:20,875
We will all cooperate with your plan.

182
00:24:33,125 --> 00:24:34,166
Brave soldiers from Kalingapuri...

183
00:24:34,666 --> 00:24:39,583
I will never attack those who came trusting my leadership.

184
00:24:40,083 --> 00:24:42,583
You are free to return the way we came.

185
00:24:43,083 --> 00:24:44,375
Not as cowards...

186
00:24:44,875 --> 00:24:46,583
Not with shame...

187
00:24:47,083 --> 00:24:51,666
But as the proud lions, who liberated men, who have been enslaved for fifteen years...

188
00:24:52,166 --> 00:24:55,666
walk back with heads held high, to your nation.

189
00:24:59,333 --> 00:25:01,500
That we defeated Kalingapuri without a war...

190
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,708
seems like a dream -You are right, your majesty.

191
00:25:04,208 --> 00:25:06,041
This country is indebted to that great warrior.

192
00:25:06,541 --> 00:25:09,541
That brave warrior did it.

193
00:25:10,041 --> 00:25:15,916
Your majesty, our prince has arrived with that brave warrior. - Delighted

194
00:25:16,416 --> 00:25:19,916
Silence in the assembly!

195
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:35,750
'Another Kochadaiiyaan?'

196
00:25:46,916 --> 00:25:50,625
He is that great warrior, father... Rana Ranvijay.

197
00:25:51,125 --> 00:25:52,458
Salutations, your majesty.

198
00:25:52,958 --> 00:25:54,666
'Kochadaiiyaan' Rana Ranvijay

199
00:25:55,166 --> 00:25:58,708
Rana, you have rewritten history.

200
00:25:59,208 --> 00:26:02,041
You have turned your father's betrayal into a sacrifice.

201
00:26:02,541 --> 00:26:04,375
Father, political discussions can wait until later.

202
00:26:04,875 --> 00:26:09,375
The whole nation is waiting to see Rana. Come, Rana.

203
00:26:09,875 --> 00:26:11,291
Long live the great warrior!

204
00:26:11,791 --> 00:26:13,666
Long live Prince Udhaybhaan!

205
00:26:14,166 --> 00:26:15,958
Long live the great warrior!

206
00:26:16,458 --> 00:26:16,666
Long live the prince!

207
00:26:17,166 --> 00:26:19,541
The hero who made this joyful day, a reality...

208
00:26:20,041 --> 00:26:22,583
'Kochadaiiyaan' Rana Ranvijay.

209
00:26:23,083 --> 00:26:25,083
My Rana?

210
00:26:25,583 --> 00:26:29,375
Will you always be with me, Rana? - Definitely, Vadhana.

211
00:26:29,875 --> 00:26:32,833
It is in Rana's nature To never forget his past.

212
00:26:33,333 --> 00:26:35,583
Our nation is forever indebted to him.

213
00:26:36,083 --> 00:26:41,208
Long live, Rana Ranvijay! Long live 'Kochadaiiyaan' Rana Ranvijay!

214
00:26:41,708 --> 00:26:45,208
Long live, Rana! Long live, Rana Ranvijay!

215
00:26:51,041 --> 00:26:54,416
Saving our soldiers, who were suffering as slaves for many years in captivity...

216
00:26:54,916 --> 00:26:57,958
and regaining more war horses than we had lost previously...

217
00:26:58,458 --> 00:27:00,291
Rana has made our motherland proud.

218
00:27:00,791 --> 00:27:01,916
Move aside. Give way.

219
00:27:02,416 --> 00:27:04,125
Come, my dear. Come soon.

220
00:27:04,625 --> 00:27:07,083
Rana, my nephew, little one... Look here.

221
00:27:07,583 --> 00:27:09,333
He is looking... He has seen us.

222
00:27:09,833 --> 00:27:12,791
He is so like Kochadaiiyaan. Just like him.

223
00:27:13,291 --> 00:27:15,625
The pride of strengthening this nation...

224
00:27:16,125 --> 00:27:19,666
belongs to Rana, who is to take charge as our army's new commander-in-chief.

225
00:27:20,166 --> 00:27:22,583
Long live Rana! Long live my nephew!

226
00:27:23,083 --> 00:27:25,333
Mother, bless me. - Brother - Brother

227
00:27:25,833 --> 00:27:27,791
How are you, my son? - I'm fine mother.

228
00:27:28,291 --> 00:27:33,333
It's time to rejoice. Everyone is meeting after such a long time

229
00:27:33,833 --> 00:27:36,083
Look at him walk... Just like a king.

230
00:27:36,583 --> 00:27:39,125
My nephew, the little one. How are you?

231
00:27:39,625 --> 00:27:42,375
Brother - Look... It is your little sister, Yamuna!

232
00:27:42,875 --> 00:27:44,875
He is your brother. Seek his blessings.

233
00:27:45,375 --> 00:27:47,416
How are you, dear? -I am well.

234
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:49,666
I am so happy to see you two together

235
00:27:50,166 --> 00:27:52,125
When you were young, didn't you two go missing together?

236
00:27:52,625 --> 00:27:55,916
But, only you have returned. Where is your elder brother Dharma?

237
00:27:56,416 --> 00:27:59,791
I do not know for sure, Where brother is, uncle.

238
00:28:00,291 --> 00:28:01,083
It's okay, nephew

239
00:28:01,583 --> 00:28:04,458
Just the way you arrived suddenly, I believe he too would come, some day.

240
00:28:04,958 --> 00:28:07,291
Where is mother? -Because the family was ruined...

241
00:28:07,791 --> 00:28:12,291
mother grieved herself... herself to..

242
00:28:12,791 --> 00:28:16,458
Don't worry. Alls well that ends well

243
00:28:16,958 --> 00:28:18,291
Not the end, uncle...

244
00:28:18,791 --> 00:28:22,291
This is just the beginning.

245
00:28:26,333 --> 00:28:29,500
'Kochadaiiyaan' Rana Ranvijay

246
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:37,208
Did he act as an orphan all these years, just to free those slaves?

247
00:28:37,708 --> 00:28:40,625
We have been betrayed

248
00:28:41,125 --> 00:28:44,625
We have been betrayed

249
00:28:48,208 --> 00:28:48,833
Veera Bhadra...

250
00:28:49,333 --> 00:28:52,625
He has made an enemy in me.

251
00:28:53,125 --> 00:28:56,291
He has started a new war.

252
00:28:56,791 --> 00:29:00,291
From now on, the war is just between Rana and me.

253
00:29:27,875 --> 00:29:30,250
Why is the horse staggering? Did you give it fodder or drinks?

254
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:33,750
Ever since you came, it's only 'Vadhana'... Haven't you forgotten her at all?

255
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:35,833
Why are you so jealous?

256
00:29:36,333 --> 00:29:37,708
Get up and come here, uncle.

257
00:29:38,208 --> 00:29:39,250
Only if I get up, can I come there.

258
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:41,583
You would have eaten well, I am sure. -What?

259
00:29:42,083 --> 00:29:43,333
When one enters, they ask, 'Have you eaten'?

260
00:29:43,833 --> 00:29:45,708
She is asking if I have already eaten. Are you out of your mind!

261
00:29:46,208 --> 00:29:47,333
I meant if you had had your drinks.

262
00:29:47,833 --> 00:29:49,791
Just because it's good liquor it doesn't mean one drinks it all day long.

263
00:29:50,291 --> 00:29:51,833
I had it for breakfast.

264
00:29:52,333 --> 00:29:53,708
Why do you cry, uncle?

265
00:29:54,208 --> 00:29:55,916
Sorrow leaves you brokenhearted

266
00:29:56,416 --> 00:29:58,125
The problem is that it is broken.

267
00:29:58,625 --> 00:30:00,333
What? -The statue, of course.

268
00:30:00,833 --> 00:30:05,500
They wanted me to make a statue of a warrior exactly like you.

269
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,041
I completed it too.

270
00:30:07,541 --> 00:30:08,166
But it is broken now.

271
00:30:08,666 --> 00:30:09,125
Who broke it?

272
00:30:09,625 --> 00:30:11,375
It must be he, who has broken it, in drunken daze.

273
00:30:11,875 --> 00:30:13,916
No. -Leave it, uncle. Do it again.

274
00:30:14,416 --> 00:30:15,333
Now? How can it be done immediately?

275
00:30:15,833 --> 00:30:17,916
Why should it be done immediately?

276
00:30:18,416 --> 00:30:22,791
They will arrive anytime now.

277
00:30:23,291 --> 00:30:24,625
They will beat me up, for sure if they don't get the statue!

278
00:30:25,125 --> 00:30:25,958
Who ordered the statue?

279
00:30:26,458 --> 00:30:28,500
Princess herself. -Vadhana Devi?

280
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,375
Yes. I have even taken an advance. That's why I am in trouble.

281
00:30:31,875 --> 00:30:36,750
If you come to my studio for half hour... No, no... two hours? Then my job will be done.

282
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:38,000
What work do I have there?

283
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:41,458
No work at all. If you just come and stand quietly and not move.

284
00:30:41,958 --> 00:30:42,625
Just like a statue.

285
00:30:43,125 --> 00:30:44,375
Why don't you return the advance?

286
00:30:44,875 --> 00:30:46,166
Only if I have, I can return it, right?

287
00:30:46,666 --> 00:30:48,833
You may be willing to lead me some money. But she won't accept it.

288
00:30:49,333 --> 00:30:52,958
For your beloved but poor maternal uncle's sake if you come by for a while...

289
00:30:53,458 --> 00:30:54,791
What is wrong will it do to you? -That is not possible.

290
00:30:55,291 --> 00:30:56,500
Don't you care about my well being?

291
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,208
When have you ever been well, uncle?

292
00:30:58,708 --> 00:31:02,041
Alright. Forget it. There is only one way for me to save myself. -What is that?

293
00:31:02,541 --> 00:31:02,875
Suicide.

294
00:31:03,375 --> 00:31:05,208
Go ahead bravely, uncle. Come what may, I am there for you.

295
00:31:05,708 --> 00:31:07,208
To do what? Light my funeral pyre?

296
00:31:07,708 --> 00:31:09,375
Take care. Don't make it too hot.

297
00:31:09,875 --> 00:31:13,375
Someone stop me.

298
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:26,875
Stop here.

299
00:31:27,375 --> 00:31:30,000
Welcome, Princess. Your arrival is making my stomach..

300
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,291
No, it's adding grace to this place. Welcome.

301
00:31:32,791 --> 00:31:34,375
I came here to see the brave warrior's statue.

302
00:31:34,875 --> 00:31:36,416
My guard said it was ready.

303
00:31:36,916 --> 00:31:38,125
It is ready. It is absolutely ready.

304
00:31:38,625 --> 00:31:39,666
But, look at this one first

305
00:31:40,166 --> 00:31:41,541
Where is my warrior's statue?

306
00:31:42,041 --> 00:31:44,333
It is right there... It was right there.

307
00:31:44,833 --> 00:31:46,916
Beautiful. -Beautiful? What is beautiful?

308
00:31:47,416 --> 00:31:51,333
How is it beautiful? What is she talking about?

309
00:31:51,833 --> 00:31:53,291
Nephew -Nephew?

310
00:31:53,791 --> 00:31:55,958
Isn't Rana my nephew?

311
00:31:56,458 --> 00:31:58,375
I sculpted a statue thinking about him...

312
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:01,208
That's why I exclaimed 'nephew'

313
00:32:01,708 --> 00:32:03,291
The brave warrior I saw yesterday...

314
00:32:03,791 --> 00:32:05,875
how could you bring him before my eyes today?

315
00:32:06,375 --> 00:32:08,333
I called and he came. -What?

316
00:32:08,833 --> 00:32:10,875
My skill, your highness.

317
00:32:11,375 --> 00:32:13,500
It is so realistic, just like looking at him in person.

318
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,541
Thank you so much, princess. You praise me too much.

319
00:32:17,041 --> 00:32:19,625
But, this part looks a little small. Does it not?

320
00:32:20,125 --> 00:32:21,291
Which part?

321
00:32:21,791 --> 00:32:23,958
Oh... It looks fine now.

322
00:32:24,458 --> 00:32:27,958
I think... you might not have seen properly then.

323
00:32:31,916 --> 00:32:34,000
Shambumitra -Yes. Tell me.

324
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,166
You have made a mistake.

325
00:32:36,666 --> 00:32:38,250
I wouldn't have done it knowingly. What is it?

326
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:39,958
Does his stomach look like this?

327
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:42,375
He had food, just now. - What? - I mean... I had food, just now.

328
00:32:42,875 --> 00:32:43,916
Not for you. - For him.

329
00:32:44,416 --> 00:32:47,750
Do you understand? Let's change it, then.

330
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:50,000
Hey, how did it rectify?

331
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,208
It got rectified. Whatever you want changed...

332
00:32:52,708 --> 00:32:53,958
all that will change, on its own.

333
00:32:54,458 --> 00:32:56,250
Oh... is that so?

334
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:58,541
Alright. I will go near and inspect.

335
00:32:59,041 --> 00:33:00,208
Hold your breath

336
00:33:00,708 --> 00:33:02,416
The paint is fresh, that's why I asked you to...

337
00:33:02,916 --> 00:33:04,416
asked you to hold your breath.

338
00:33:04,916 --> 00:33:06,250
Shoulders that spread wide...

339
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:09,166
Obviously. How many burdens it has to bear!

340
00:33:09,666 --> 00:33:13,333
The smooth cheeks... seems perfect for me to kiss.

341
00:33:13,833 --> 00:33:14,375
Go on, kiss him.

342
00:33:14,875 --> 00:33:17,875
"Interested..."

343
00:33:18,375 --> 00:33:21,541
"Interested..."

344
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:25,208
"In you..."

345
00:33:25,708 --> 00:33:30,833
"I am"

346
00:33:31,333 --> 00:33:34,541
"Interested..."

347
00:33:35,041 --> 00:33:38,083
"Interested..."

348
00:33:38,583 --> 00:33:41,833
"In you..."

349
00:33:42,333 --> 00:33:45,333
"I am"

350
00:33:45,833 --> 00:33:48,750
"Whether I should say this or not?"

351
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:52,416
"My hearts wants to belong to you"

352
00:33:52,916 --> 00:34:00,166
"I have no control over my emotions anymore"

353
00:34:00,666 --> 00:34:03,791
"Interested..."

354
00:34:04,291 --> 00:34:07,333
"Interested..."

355
00:34:07,833 --> 00:34:11,208
"Why are you..."

356
00:34:11,708 --> 00:34:16,000
"In me"

357
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:19,625
"A desire to love"

358
00:34:20,125 --> 00:34:22,166
"I don't have time to love at the moment"

359
00:34:22,666 --> 00:34:26,958
"You know there are many things greater and better than love"

360
00:34:27,458 --> 00:34:29,625
"The heart blossoms"

361
00:34:30,125 --> 00:34:36,791
"My eyes speak another language"

362
00:34:37,291 --> 00:34:44,166
"look...look into my eyes"

363
00:34:44,666 --> 00:34:47,833
"I don't have time at the moment"

364
00:34:48,333 --> 00:34:51,833
"I have to worry about the future"

365
00:34:58,625 --> 00:35:01,750
"With you, the hues of love"

366
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:05,500
"Kindles desire, sets me ablaze"

367
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,500
"Resounds through my body. Tell me how you feel, my love"

368
00:35:27,791 --> 00:35:30,916
"With you, the hues of love"

369
00:35:31,416 --> 00:35:34,791
"Kindles desire, sets me ablaze"

370
00:35:35,291 --> 00:35:41,625
"Resounds through my body. Tell me how you feel, my love"

371
00:35:42,125 --> 00:35:44,250
"To you"

372
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:47,291
"I belong"

373
00:35:47,791 --> 00:35:51,041
"My world... you are my world"

374
00:35:51,541 --> 00:35:54,833
"You are where I am. I am where you are"

375
00:35:55,333 --> 00:35:58,541
"Such words won't affect me, my lady"

376
00:35:59,041 --> 00:36:02,375
"How can I love? I have responsibilities to fulfill"

377
00:36:02,875 --> 00:36:06,375
"O my beloved"

378
00:36:11,958 --> 00:36:13,083
"Don't say that"

379
00:36:13,583 --> 00:36:16,791
"With you, the hues of love"

380
00:36:17,291 --> 00:36:20,583
"Kindles desire, sets me ablaze"

381
00:36:21,083 --> 00:36:24,583
"Resounds through my body. Tell me how you feel, my love"

382
00:36:41,125 --> 00:36:44,291
"A desire to love"

383
00:36:44,791 --> 00:36:46,875
"I don't have time to love at the moment"

384
00:36:47,375 --> 00:36:51,541
"You know there are many things greater..."

385
00:36:52,041 --> 00:36:54,083
" and better than love"

386
00:36:54,583 --> 00:36:57,791
"Look...look into my eyes"

387
00:36:58,291 --> 00:37:01,458
"My eyes speak another language"

388
00:37:01,958 --> 00:37:08,958
"Look...look into my eyes. What do you see?"

389
00:37:09,458 --> 00:37:12,416
"Interested..."

390
00:37:12,916 --> 00:37:16,166
"Interested..."

391
00:37:16,666 --> 00:37:19,875
"In you..."

392
00:37:20,375 --> 00:37:23,541
"I am"

393
00:37:24,041 --> 00:37:27,208
"Interested..."

394
00:37:27,708 --> 00:37:30,750
"Interested..."

395
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:34,500
"Why are you..."

396
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,500
"In me"

397
00:37:44,333 --> 00:37:46,250
Please do not mistake my words.

398
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:48,541
But you are from the royal family.

399
00:37:49,041 --> 00:37:51,083
We are mere subjects, who work for you.

400
00:37:51,583 --> 00:37:55,125
You wishing to make an alliance with our family is wrong.

401
00:37:55,625 --> 00:37:57,333
And I... Wait...

402
00:37:57,833 --> 00:37:59,500
Rana. When did you get here?

403
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,208
We know not, when you will come or how you will come.

404
00:38:02,708 --> 00:38:05,791
The thing is... the prince wanted a tour of the studio...

405
00:38:06,291 --> 00:38:08,000
Here, in the backyard? - Yes, I wanted to show him a statue...

406
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:09,708
Do not talk in circles, uncle. Tell me the truth.

407
00:38:10,208 --> 00:38:12,291
No. It is nothing. I bid farewell. - Rana

408
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:14,541
I will tell you the truth.

409
00:38:15,041 --> 00:38:17,791
Your sister and I...

410
00:38:18,291 --> 00:38:21,750
have been in love, for a very long time now.

411
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:25,666
We both have decided to get married.

412
00:38:26,166 --> 00:38:29,333
But, it is your maternal uncle who has been objecting to it.

413
00:38:29,833 --> 00:38:30,625
No. Not me.

414
00:38:31,125 --> 00:38:35,000
I agree to the marriage. But, the king must agree, right?

415
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:36,208
Why would he not agree?

416
00:38:36,708 --> 00:38:39,541
A prince is expected to marry into a king's family with royal lineage...

417
00:38:40,041 --> 00:38:42,458
or at least within the nobility, is it not?

418
00:38:42,958 --> 00:38:45,875
Uncle, once two hearts have come together, all that is not necessary.

419
00:38:46,375 --> 00:38:49,625
But it is necessary for marriage... the king would say.

420
00:38:50,125 --> 00:38:51,833
Love, it is love, uncle. - What...

421
00:38:52,333 --> 00:38:55,666
It comes by looking into one's eyes. Not, by looking at one's family.

422
00:38:56,166 --> 00:38:58,708
It comes by looking at one's inner beauty. Not, looking at one's abode.

423
00:38:59,208 --> 00:39:01,625
It blooms by each other's fragrance. Not, by looking at one's lineage.

424
00:39:02,125 --> 00:39:03,541
Yes, of course. It is true.

425
00:39:04,041 --> 00:39:07,083
These days, even statues seem to be falling in love.

426
00:39:07,583 --> 00:39:08,958
You have my support for your love.

427
00:39:09,458 --> 00:39:10,791
Thanks, Rana -Why thank me?

428
00:39:11,291 --> 00:39:12,333
True. Why thank us?

429
00:39:12,833 --> 00:39:14,208
We are going to give one and get another.

430
00:39:14,708 --> 00:39:15,041
What is he saying?

431
00:39:15,541 --> 00:39:16,458
He is blathering. He must be drunk.

432
00:39:16,958 --> 00:39:20,541
No, I am not. Now that you have reminded me...

433
00:39:21,041 --> 00:39:24,625
Rana, I'm happy to have got your blessing.

434
00:39:25,125 --> 00:39:26,750
But, just as your uncle said...

435
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:30,333
my worry is only about whether my father would agree to this.

436
00:39:30,833 --> 00:39:34,333
I bid farewell.

437
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:38,125
Yamuna?

438
00:39:38,625 --> 00:39:41,875
Are you bidding him farewell with your eyes?

439
00:39:42,375 --> 00:39:43,541
No, brother.

440
00:39:44,041 --> 00:39:45,250
I am not bidding farewell.

441
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:49,250
Just as he was saying, what if the king does not accept...?

442
00:39:58,666 --> 00:40:01,875
I'm pleased with the renovation's progress.

443
00:40:02,375 --> 00:40:05,833
Very good. Let us go in.

444
00:40:06,333 --> 00:40:07,833
Rana, about what happened yesterday...

445
00:40:08,333 --> 00:40:10,375
Leave that, my friend. I will take care of that.

446
00:40:10,875 --> 00:40:14,000
For some time now, I have wanted to tell you something...

447
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:15,375
I do not know why...

448
00:40:15,875 --> 00:40:19,458
but I suspect that our king has enemies within the state.

449
00:40:19,958 --> 00:40:21,791
Now and then, we have received threats too.

450
00:40:22,291 --> 00:40:25,416
I worry for my father's life, Rana

451
00:40:25,916 --> 00:40:29,458
It is only you who...

452
00:40:29,958 --> 00:40:31,041
Do not worry, my friend.

453
00:40:31,541 --> 00:40:36,500
As long as I am there, no one can dare to kill the king.

454
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:42,708
But, still... I think it is better to strengthen the king's security.

455
00:40:43,208 --> 00:40:45,083
Rightly said. I will pass the order right away.

456
00:40:45,583 --> 00:40:47,458
Deva Devan -Tell me, your highness.

457
00:40:47,958 --> 00:40:52,458
Follow me. - As you command.

458
00:40:52,958 --> 00:40:54,500
Your majesty...

459
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,500
shall we go up to the terrace? -Let us.

460
00:41:06,125 --> 00:41:09,625
The beauty of Kottaipattinam overwhelms me.

461
00:41:15,041 --> 00:41:18,541
The boundaries of Kottaipattinam must extend even beyond the horizon.

462
00:41:24,125 --> 00:41:27,333
Father

463
00:41:27,833 --> 00:41:31,333
Udhaybhaan

464
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:01,833
Your majesty...? - I am fine.

465
00:42:02,333 --> 00:42:04,125
Rana...

466
00:42:04,625 --> 00:42:08,000
I do not know how to thank you.

467
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:10,041
Wait a moment, man. Is the front door nearby?

468
00:42:10,541 --> 00:42:13,125
It is almost in the next street. I need to get there. Then, open

469
00:42:13,625 --> 00:42:17,125
I have opened.

470
00:42:19,166 --> 00:42:22,666
Oh my God! - What is it, uncle?

471
00:42:28,166 --> 00:42:30,041
The king at this humble subject's home...?

472
00:42:30,541 --> 00:42:34,291
If you had sent word, I would have come myself. Welcome. Please come in.

473
00:42:34,791 --> 00:42:36,250
Why are you honoring me, your highness?

474
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:38,916
You have saved the nation's king and the crown prince...

475
00:42:39,416 --> 00:42:40,500
without heeding your own life

476
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,958
Hence to show our gratitude, a small gift from our side.

477
00:42:45,458 --> 00:42:47,583
Take it inside.

478
00:42:48,083 --> 00:42:48,708
Please wait a moment.

479
00:42:49,208 --> 00:42:50,166
Your majesty... -Hmm

480
00:42:50,666 --> 00:42:52,333
I just did my duty.

481
00:42:52,833 --> 00:42:55,458
It seems like you are dishonoring me by giving me, all this in return.

482
00:42:55,958 --> 00:42:59,875
If what I offer is not what you need... you may ask me whatever you desire.

483
00:43:00,375 --> 00:43:02,000
I am prepared to grant it.

484
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:06,000
You may ask whatever you want.

485
00:43:09,875 --> 00:43:13,375
It is the prince, I want.

486
00:43:15,791 --> 00:43:17,750
I want him to come as the son-in-law of our family.

487
00:43:18,250 --> 00:43:21,416
I want him to come as the husband of my sister, Yamuna.

488
00:43:21,916 --> 00:43:25,291
Your majesty, they both are in love with each other.

489
00:43:25,791 --> 00:43:29,583
I ask this of you, knowing that.

490
00:43:30,083 --> 00:43:31,208
Beg your pardon, your majesty.

491
00:43:31,708 --> 00:43:34,458
I am in love with Yamuna.

492
00:43:34,958 --> 00:43:42,458
Will Yamuna Devi gets married to the prince, will she become a princess?

493
00:43:42,958 --> 00:43:44,083
What will the king do now?

494
00:43:44,583 --> 00:43:46,125
Let us see what happens.

495
00:43:46,625 --> 00:43:50,125
Come here.

496
00:43:53,625 --> 00:43:58,791
Rana, you do know what, how, where and to whom, something must be asked.

497
00:43:59,291 --> 00:44:00,208
You are very clever.

498
00:44:00,708 --> 00:44:06,666
But, the king of Kottaipattinam will never go back on his word.

499
00:44:07,166 --> 00:44:09,083
I agree to this marriage.

500
00:44:09,583 --> 00:44:10,708
The king agreed?

501
00:44:11,208 --> 00:44:12,125
Yamuna is very fortunate

502
00:44:12,625 --> 00:44:16,125
Rana is very clever

503
00:44:20,750 --> 00:44:26,375
"We will share our joys and sorrows"

504
00:44:26,875 --> 00:44:32,250
"A promise... This is a promise"

505
00:44:32,750 --> 00:44:38,416
"I will never leave you"

506
00:44:38,916 --> 00:44:43,916
"A promise... This is a promise"

507
00:44:44,416 --> 00:44:50,416
"You are my joy. You are my happiness..."

508
00:44:50,916 --> 00:44:54,416
"You are the one I worship. You are my life"

509
00:45:08,833 --> 00:45:14,291
"I will never make you cry"

510
00:45:14,791 --> 00:45:20,250
"I will never let happiness abandon us"

511
00:45:20,750 --> 00:45:26,250
"We will be each other's shadow"

512
00:45:26,750 --> 00:45:32,375
"We will take a new form and hue everyday"

513
00:45:32,875 --> 00:45:38,333
"We will look for new ways to love everyday"

514
00:45:38,833 --> 00:45:44,333
"Our lives will be full of song. And our songs will reflect our hopes"

515
00:45:44,833 --> 00:45:50,416
"We will share our joys and sorrows"

516
00:45:50,916 --> 00:45:56,208
"A promise... This is a promise"

517
00:45:56,708 --> 00:46:02,458
"I will never leave you"

518
00:46:02,958 --> 00:46:06,458
"A promise... This is a promise"

519
00:46:20,916 --> 00:46:26,416
"I shall cross all limits for love"

520
00:46:26,916 --> 00:46:32,333
"I will do anything for you"

521
00:46:32,833 --> 00:46:38,291
"You are my companion. You are my mate"

522
00:46:38,791 --> 00:46:44,458
"In your absence, my life lacked something"

523
00:46:44,958 --> 00:46:50,375
"You are my sky. You are my ground"

524
00:46:50,875 --> 00:46:56,291
"I will bring a shine in your eyes and take away the tears"

525
00:46:56,791 --> 00:47:02,291
"Now I shall never be able to stay away from you"

526
00:47:02,791 --> 00:47:06,291
"You can make me promise anything and everything now"

527
00:47:28,083 --> 00:47:33,708
"We will share our joys and sorrows"

528
00:47:34,208 --> 00:47:39,666
"A promise... This is a promise"

529
00:47:40,166 --> 00:47:45,666
"I will never leave you"

530
00:47:46,166 --> 00:47:51,416
"A promise... This is a promise"

531
00:47:51,916 --> 00:47:57,833
"You are my joy. You are my happiness..."

532
00:47:58,333 --> 00:48:03,833
"You are the one I worship. You are my life"

533
00:48:04,333 --> 00:48:07,833
"You are the one I worship. You are my life"

534
00:48:16,791 --> 00:48:20,333
As a father, I have fulfilled my duty.

535
00:48:20,833 --> 00:48:22,666
But, as the king of this nation...

536
00:48:23,166 --> 00:48:26,916
seated on this throne, I have a duty, yet to perform.

537
00:48:27,416 --> 00:48:32,958
As he married into, neither a royal family nor a royal lineage...

538
00:48:33,458 --> 00:48:41,458
from this day forward, Prince Udhaybhaann is no more the crown prince.

539
00:48:41,958 --> 00:48:45,458
Moreover, I declare that he has lost his right to rule Kottaipattinam after me...

540
00:48:56,250 --> 00:49:00,916
Although you have lost the right to rule this nation...

541
00:49:01,416 --> 00:49:10,000
as you are my son, you have not lost the right to live in this palace.

542
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:12,000
Thank you, father

543
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:14,083
I do not need your nation.

544
00:49:14,583 --> 00:49:16,625
Her company shall suffice

545
00:49:17,125 --> 00:49:18,958
When I do not have the right to rule...

546
00:49:19,458 --> 00:49:21,833
What is the need for these riches alone?

547
00:49:22,333 --> 00:49:25,833
Bid me farewell.

548
00:49:31,333 --> 00:49:33,083
Yamuna dear!

549
00:49:33,583 --> 00:49:36,750
Yamuna

550
00:49:37,250 --> 00:49:40,750
Yamuna

551
00:49:55,083 --> 00:49:56,291
What is this, your highness?

552
00:49:56,791 --> 00:49:59,083
How long are you going to sit here like this?

553
00:49:59,583 --> 00:50:00,583
I do not know, Maithli.

554
00:50:01,083 --> 00:50:04,875
Should I feel sad that my brother has left this palace?

555
00:50:05,375 --> 00:50:09,291
Or, happy that my father might accept my love too...

556
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:13,625
just like he accepted my brother's love?

557
00:50:14,125 --> 00:50:14,791
I don't know...

558
00:50:15,291 --> 00:50:16,125
But, your highness...

559
00:50:16,625 --> 00:50:19,833
for marrying Rana's sister, who was not born in a royal family...

560
00:50:20,333 --> 00:50:21,458
the king has banished the prince.

561
00:50:21,958 --> 00:50:24,958
What if he banishes you too?

562
00:50:25,458 --> 00:50:27,166
My father will never banish me.

563
00:50:27,666 --> 00:50:28,583
So what if he does that too?

564
00:50:29,083 --> 00:50:31,125
I will still be with Rana.

565
00:50:31,625 --> 00:50:35,125
It was a decision taken long ago. No one can change it anymore.

566
00:50:50,791 --> 00:50:54,291
Summon Vadhana!

567
00:51:15,708 --> 00:51:17,208
Hey, who are you?

568
00:51:17,708 --> 00:51:18,708
Who is he? Capture him

569
00:51:19,208 --> 00:51:22,708
Search the entire palace for him.

570
00:52:22,541 --> 00:52:26,041
Who are you?

571
00:53:46,208 --> 00:53:47,791
Catch him.

572
00:53:48,291 --> 00:53:51,791
Don't let him go.

573
00:54:06,916 --> 00:54:07,458
You?

574
00:54:07,958 --> 00:54:09,625
You are the one who came to kill me?

575
00:54:10,125 --> 00:54:11,666
Why?

576
00:54:12,166 --> 00:54:15,166
When the explanation and the conclusion is as clear as mirror...

577
00:54:15,666 --> 00:54:20,291
why do I need to give more justification to you?

578
00:54:20,791 --> 00:54:22,083
Whatever the rescuer of soldiers wishes for, it shall be granted.

579
00:54:22,583 --> 00:54:24,958
Should I trust you...

580
00:54:25,458 --> 00:54:27,875
For treason... He has committed such a crime...

581
00:54:28,375 --> 00:54:29,333
Hence... Kochadaiiyaan...

582
00:54:29,833 --> 00:54:32,916
Imprison Rana

583
00:54:33,416 --> 00:54:35,458
You cannot escape, Ripudhaman

584
00:54:35,958 --> 00:54:39,458
You can escape death but not Rana

585
00:54:54,541 --> 00:54:57,291
You have performed all the rituals. Now tell me.

586
00:54:57,791 --> 00:54:58,791
What does my horoscope say?

587
00:54:59,291 --> 00:55:00,416
Your majesty, as per your horoscope...

588
00:55:00,916 --> 00:55:02,083
it is a critical period for you but there won't be any danger to your life.

589
00:55:02,583 --> 00:55:06,250
But according to your daughter's horoscope, your life could be in danger.

590
00:55:06,750 --> 00:55:09,416
What? Is there some remedy to avert it?

591
00:55:09,916 --> 00:55:10,958
Before the end of this month...

592
00:55:11,458 --> 00:55:15,958
if you find a prince from a royal dynasty, born in the Ashtam star...

593
00:55:16,458 --> 00:55:18,250
and get her married to him...

594
00:55:18,750 --> 00:55:23,250
your life may be spared.

595
00:55:23,750 --> 00:55:25,583
Is that all?

596
00:55:26,083 --> 00:55:27,208
Deva Devan -Your majesty

597
00:55:27,708 --> 00:55:29,375
Look for probable matches in horoscopes...

598
00:55:29,875 --> 00:55:33,041
of princes, belonging to royal dynasties and equivalent in status to us.

599
00:55:33,541 --> 00:55:35,875
Find a match that is amicable and desirable to our dynasty's honor

600
00:55:36,375 --> 00:55:37,458
As you wish, your majesty

601
00:55:37,958 --> 00:55:42,416
But with Rana in her heart, how will she marry someone else...?

602
00:55:42,916 --> 00:55:44,250
What are you blabbering?

603
00:55:44,750 --> 00:55:46,833
After knowing that he tried to murder her father...

604
00:55:47,333 --> 00:55:50,833
will she still be thinking about him?

605
00:55:56,666 --> 00:56:05,000
"I burn, my beloved..."

606
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:09,000
"Sorrows keep me warm"

607
00:56:19,583 --> 00:56:26,291
"I cannot bear the heat..."

608
00:56:26,791 --> 00:56:30,291
"My body aches, in love I suffer "

609
00:56:42,583 --> 00:56:48,083
"I cannot express my sufferings..."

610
00:56:48,583 --> 00:56:51,708
"My sorrows might take..."

611
00:56:52,208 --> 00:56:57,208
"my life"

612
00:56:57,708 --> 00:57:00,750
"Like this"

613
00:57:01,250 --> 00:57:04,916
"Like this"

614
00:57:05,416 --> 00:57:12,916
"There are always tears in my eyes"

615
00:57:13,416 --> 00:57:22,041
"What is this sudden change in my eyes?"

616
00:57:22,541 --> 00:57:29,250
"My sorrows might take..."

617
00:57:29,750 --> 00:57:35,875
"my life"

618
00:57:36,375 --> 00:57:39,541
"Like this"

619
00:57:40,041 --> 00:57:42,916
"Like this"

620
00:57:43,416 --> 00:57:51,000
"The wet kohl on my eyelids"

621
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:53,708
"We're the pouring clouds."

622
00:57:54,208 --> 00:57:55,750
"Don't fear us."

623
00:57:56,250 --> 00:57:57,625
"It's the frequent visitor.."

624
00:57:58,125 --> 00:57:59,833
"..of the world of love."

625
00:58:00,333 --> 00:58:01,375
"We're the pouring clouds."

626
00:58:01,875 --> 00:58:05,375
"Don't fear us. - O Rana."

627
00:58:05,875 --> 00:58:07,791
"O Rana"

628
00:58:08,291 --> 00:58:11,791
"Don't cry. Your tears drown my courage"

629
00:58:42,666 --> 00:58:50,083
"My sorrows might take..."

630
00:58:50,583 --> 00:58:58,250
"my life"

631
00:58:58,750 --> 00:59:01,708
"Like this"

632
00:59:02,208 --> 00:59:05,625
"Like this"

633
00:59:06,125 --> 00:59:13,708
"The wet kohl on my eyelids"

634
00:59:14,208 --> 00:59:22,416
"What is this sudden change in my eyes?"

635
00:59:22,916 --> 00:59:24,458
"Love is like a spring.."

636
00:59:24,958 --> 00:59:26,333
"We're like the water waves."

637
00:59:26,833 --> 00:59:28,541
"We'll meet one day."

638
00:59:29,041 --> 00:59:30,541
"No matter how much one puts restrictions."

639
00:59:31,041 --> 00:59:32,000
"Love is like a spring.."

640
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:38,583
"Mix in, blend into each other." - "We're like the water waves."

641
00:59:39,083 --> 00:59:46,916
"Come, live with me."

642
00:59:47,416 --> 00:59:55,250
"Come, live with me."

643
00:59:55,750 --> 01:00:04,416
"Now, you are my life."

644
01:00:04,916 --> 01:00:08,416
"You are my death."

645
01:00:29,750 --> 01:00:30,541
All of you, leave

646
01:00:31,041 --> 01:00:34,541
As you wish, your highness. Come on

647
01:00:37,208 --> 01:00:41,458
Open the door.

648
01:00:41,958 --> 01:00:45,458
Rana

649
01:00:49,125 --> 01:00:50,833
Why?

650
01:00:51,333 --> 01:00:54,833
Why, Rana?

651
01:00:56,750 --> 01:00:58,875
Why did you come there to kill my father?

652
01:00:59,375 --> 01:01:00,833
It is not wrong...

653
01:01:01,333 --> 01:01:03,041
It is not wrong to tell you.

654
01:01:03,541 --> 01:01:08,166
All those feelings of revenge, locked in my heart for years now...

655
01:01:08,666 --> 01:01:14,375
It is not wrong to share this with you, who is going to live your life with me.

656
01:01:14,875 --> 01:01:18,125
Kochadaiiyaan, my beloved father

657
01:01:18,625 --> 01:01:21,750
True to his name, a great warrior having wild and flowing hair...

658
01:01:22,250 --> 01:01:23,750
he lived in the hearts of people, liked more than the king...

659
01:01:24,250 --> 01:01:25,625
The beloved commander-in-chief

660
01:01:26,125 --> 01:01:28,458
A humane person and a brave warrior.

661
01:01:28,958 --> 01:01:30,083
He was a staunch devotee of Lord Shiva.

662
01:01:30,583 --> 01:01:32,375
On every holy night of Lord Shiva...

663
01:01:32,875 --> 01:01:35,791
with his mane of long hair and a body shimmering like coral...

664
01:01:36,291 --> 01:01:39,083
almost like an incarnation of Lord Shiva, he would dance in ecstasy.

665
01:01:39,583 --> 01:01:43,083
To witness this mesmerising vision, the entire nation would gather around.

666
01:01:58,625 --> 01:02:02,041
"Thou, the blossom; Thou, the gentle breeze "

667
01:02:02,541 --> 01:02:05,166
"Thou, the prayers; Thou, the hymns"

668
01:02:05,666 --> 01:02:09,041
"Thou, the flourishing spring; Thou, the lotus flower on a lake"

669
01:02:09,541 --> 01:02:12,375
"My Lord, I surrender at thy feet"

670
01:02:12,875 --> 01:02:15,500
"My Lord, I surrender at thy feet"

671
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:19,500
"Life shall be free of death"

672
01:02:27,833 --> 01:02:34,208
"Kochadaiiyaan... Our Kochadaiiyaan!"

673
01:02:34,708 --> 01:02:37,708
"Kochadaiiyaan!"

674
01:02:38,208 --> 01:02:41,250
"One who resembles truth- Kochadaiiyaan"

675
01:02:41,750 --> 01:02:45,416
"Kochadaiiyaan... Our Kochadaiiyaan!"

676
01:02:45,916 --> 01:02:52,000
"One to whom strength belongs- Kochadaiiyaan"

677
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:56,000
"One whose name will be uttered beyond his time- Kochadaiiyaan"

678
01:03:33,708 --> 01:03:37,208
"Kochadaiiyaan... Our Kochadaiiyaan!"

679
01:04:08,125 --> 01:04:11,625
"Hail Lord Shiva, God of the Gods!"

680
01:04:29,833 --> 01:04:32,416
Like how his dancing skill embodied his devotion to Lord Shiva...

681
01:04:32,916 --> 01:04:36,166
his war skill embodied his true devotion to his nation.

682
01:04:36,666 --> 01:04:40,166
Due to his courage and strength, the boundaries of Kottaipattinam expanded.

683
01:04:49,541 --> 01:04:53,041
"Kochadaiiyaan... Our Kochadaiiyaan!"

684
01:05:04,625 --> 01:05:08,583
The respect he got came from the heart...

685
01:05:09,083 --> 01:05:14,375
That is how much the subjects of his nation loved him

686
01:05:14,875 --> 01:05:15,541
Long live the king!

687
01:05:16,041 --> 01:05:19,041
Long live the king of Kottaipattinam Ripudhaman!

688
01:05:19,541 --> 01:05:21,166
Long live Kochadaiiyaan!

689
01:05:21,666 --> 01:05:25,041
The king who used Kochadaiiyaan to fulfill his desires...

690
01:05:25,541 --> 01:05:28,625
was jealous of the way Kochadaiiyaan ruled people's hearts.

691
01:05:29,125 --> 01:05:30,666
He was so kind that...

692
01:05:31,166 --> 01:05:35,208
his words were the rule even in the royal assembly.

693
01:05:35,708 --> 01:05:39,791
All the important decisions of the court were the ones that Kochadaiiyaan took.

694
01:05:40,291 --> 01:05:42,166
He who hadn't paid his taxes for years together...

695
01:05:42,666 --> 01:05:44,958
has started paying it, now that Kochadaiiyaan is in charge.

696
01:05:45,458 --> 01:05:48,958
Isn't Kottaipattinam totally dependent on Kochadaiiyaan?

697
01:05:52,833 --> 01:05:56,666
You have paid more taxes than usual. Congratulations

698
01:05:57,166 --> 01:06:00,833
The credit only goes to Kochadaiiyaan, your majesty.

699
01:06:01,333 --> 01:06:04,375
I am surprised. Even you have decided to pay your tax?

700
01:06:04,875 --> 01:06:05,833
Fearing the wrath of Kochadaiiyaan,

701
01:06:06,333 --> 01:06:09,791
we are forced to pay taxes properly, your majesty.

702
01:06:10,291 --> 01:06:12,125
Kochadaiiyaan!

703
01:06:12,625 --> 01:06:14,583
Everywhere and in everything, it is Kochadaiiyaan

704
01:06:15,083 --> 01:06:17,500
Your majesty, this Kochadaiiyaan... I will...

705
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:21,375
Those in power must be patient.

706
01:06:21,875 --> 01:06:25,375
They should wait for the right opportunity.

707
01:06:25,875 --> 01:06:29,375
Kochadaiiyaan will give us an opportunity.

708
01:06:44,333 --> 01:06:46,791
The commander-in-chief of Kottaipattinam, my father..

709
01:06:47,291 --> 01:06:51,083
.. Kochadaiiyaan was returning to his motherland, with his army...

710
01:06:51,583 --> 01:06:55,458
Purchasing horses and weapons from Persia to further strengthen Kottaipattinam

711
01:06:55,958 --> 01:07:00,000
That night...

712
01:07:00,500 --> 01:07:04,000
Kochadaiiyaan's fleet has arrived. Get ready

713
01:07:45,125 --> 01:07:48,625
Hail Lord Shiva, God of the Gods!

714
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:58,000
Tell me the reason why Kalingapuri's warriors become sea pirates!

715
01:10:58,500 --> 01:11:01,333
To steal the warhorses and weapons you bought in Persia...

716
01:11:01,833 --> 01:11:03,541
in order to strengthen our forces...

717
01:11:04,041 --> 01:11:05,708
was the order from Kalingapuri's king.

718
01:11:06,208 --> 01:11:07,916
To encounter enemies face-to-face in the battlefield...

719
01:11:08,416 --> 01:11:10,333
and to defeat them is the ethics of war craft.

720
01:11:10,833 --> 01:11:13,875
To steal ones enemy's weapons and strengthen one's army...

721
01:11:14,375 --> 01:11:15,791
is an act of cowardice.

722
01:11:16,291 --> 01:11:19,791
Go and tell your king that these were the words of Kochadaiiyaan!

723
01:11:24,791 --> 01:11:25,791
Commander...

724
01:11:26,291 --> 01:11:29,791
You should have killed the enemy. Why did you spare their lives

725
01:11:33,250 --> 01:11:34,333
To destroy an enemy...

726
01:11:34,833 --> 01:11:37,416
there are many ways"

727
01:11:37,916 --> 01:11:39,083
The first is...

728
01:11:39,583 --> 01:11:41,708
forgiveness

729
01:11:42,208 --> 01:11:43,375
Change is necessary

730
01:11:43,875 --> 01:11:47,375
The one who changes with times, survives

731
01:12:12,291 --> 01:12:17,833
"Welcome, from the bottom of my heart"

732
01:12:18,333 --> 01:12:23,666
"You are the one who solves all problems"

733
01:12:24,166 --> 01:12:29,666
"Welcome, from the bottom of my heart"

734
01:12:30,166 --> 01:12:35,458
"Change shall come because of you"

735
01:12:35,958 --> 01:12:41,375
"You lead with love and, this nation shall follow you"

736
01:12:41,875 --> 01:12:47,458
"You win and yet bring all the traditions along..."

737
01:12:47,958 --> 01:12:53,416
"One needs to change the way they think to bring about change"

738
01:12:53,916 --> 01:12:59,666
"And you are the one who shall guide our thoughts"

739
01:13:00,166 --> 01:13:09,916
"Say something, once again, reveal the secrets"

740
01:13:10,416 --> 01:13:11,458
"Be patient"

741
01:13:11,958 --> 01:13:15,458
"You can even gather water in a sieve, if you wait patiently until it becomes ice"

742
01:13:27,916 --> 01:13:33,666
"Happiness may be rented with money, but it cannot be bought"

743
01:13:34,166 --> 01:13:38,875
"More than the enmity of an enemy A friend's enmity is perilous"

744
01:13:39,375 --> 01:13:47,250
"Rise before the sun. You will even win over the sun"

745
01:13:47,750 --> 01:13:52,333
"Does 'you' refer to a body, a life, a name?"

746
01:13:52,833 --> 01:13:56,833
"Not any of the three, your action"

747
01:13:57,333 --> 01:14:02,875
"As much as you believe in God"

748
01:14:03,375 --> 01:14:08,833
"We believe in you just the same"

749
01:14:09,333 --> 01:14:14,083
"The one above, smiles"

750
01:14:14,583 --> 01:14:20,500
"He does whatever he wants to do"

751
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:26,541
"One needs to change the way they think to bring about change"

752
01:14:27,041 --> 01:14:32,750
"And you are the one who shall guide our thoughts"

753
01:14:33,250 --> 01:14:36,750
"Say something, once again, reveal the secrets"

754
01:15:00,333 --> 01:15:02,250
'You may go', says the master"

755
01:15:02,750 --> 01:15:04,791
"'Come, let us go', says the leader"

756
01:15:05,291 --> 01:15:09,791
"Are you a master or a leader?"

757
01:15:10,291 --> 01:15:13,458
"If you take to running, sorrow will come chasing"

758
01:15:13,958 --> 01:15:17,458
"Face it bravely, the chasing sorrow will take to its heels"

759
01:15:27,166 --> 01:15:28,708
"Control your anger"

760
01:15:29,208 --> 01:15:34,291
"The one who rises with anger, falls down with failure"

761
01:15:34,791 --> 01:15:38,458
"My friend, everything is but for a short while"

762
01:15:38,958 --> 01:15:44,458
"In few words you share your thoughts"

763
01:15:44,958 --> 01:15:50,458
"You tell us what helps and guides day and night"

764
01:15:50,958 --> 01:15:56,583
"One needs to change the way they think to bring about change"

765
01:15:57,083 --> 01:16:02,791
"And you are the one who shall guide our thoughts"

766
01:16:03,291 --> 01:16:06,791
"Say something, once again, reveal the secrets"

767
01:17:37,250 --> 01:17:38,208
Commander...

768
01:17:38,708 --> 01:17:40,541
Commander...

769
01:17:41,041 --> 01:17:44,458
I was swimming in the sea of joy... with my family.

770
01:17:44,958 --> 01:17:46,458
Tired after chasing the soldiers from Kalingapuri...

771
01:17:46,958 --> 01:17:49,041
All the soldiers have had their food and slept.

772
01:17:49,541 --> 01:17:53,416
As you have not yet had your food, the men in your ship haven't had it either.

773
01:17:53,916 --> 01:17:56,875
I have never let even my wife to wait for me.

774
01:17:57,375 --> 01:17:59,208
Then should you all wait for me?

775
01:17:59,708 --> 01:18:02,583
Devotion and respect should be felt in the heart.

776
01:18:03,083 --> 01:18:03,916
Why bring it to the stomach?

777
01:18:04,416 --> 01:18:06,625
I feel faint.

778
01:18:07,125 --> 01:18:08,083
My throat hurts.

779
01:18:08,583 --> 01:18:09,708
I want to vomit.

780
01:18:10,208 --> 01:18:14,708
What is happening to our soldiers?

781
01:18:15,208 --> 01:18:18,708
Anchor all the ships immediately.

782
01:18:44,833 --> 01:18:46,333
Healer... what is happening?

783
01:18:46,833 --> 01:18:50,333
Commander, Kalingapuri's soldiers have mixed poison in our food.

784
01:18:58,208 --> 01:19:01,708
Betrayal... They have played with our lives.

785
01:19:02,208 --> 01:19:04,791
Healer, we do have antidotes, don't we?

786
01:19:05,291 --> 01:19:06,750
It is there. But, not enough for everyone.

787
01:19:07,250 --> 01:19:09,708
Only a few can be saved. -Where can we find more?

788
01:19:10,208 --> 01:19:14,583
To find those antidote herbs, we have to go towards land.

789
01:19:15,083 --> 01:19:16,750
If we don't administer the antidote within a few hours...

790
01:19:17,250 --> 01:19:17,958
they all will die.

791
01:19:18,458 --> 01:19:19,708
Where is the nearest land located?

792
01:19:20,208 --> 01:19:23,708
The only land area nearby is Kalingapuri. We can reach by dawn.

793
01:19:30,166 --> 01:19:32,208
Turn all the ships and head towards Kalingapuri.

794
01:19:32,708 --> 01:19:35,750
Commander, how can we ask help to those who tried to kill us?

795
01:19:36,250 --> 01:19:39,750
To me, my people's lives are paramount.

796
01:19:48,208 --> 01:19:49,166
Your majesty...

797
01:19:49,666 --> 01:19:53,166
Kochadaiiyaan is sailing towards us with his army.

798
01:20:02,375 --> 01:20:06,375
Welcome, O protector of Kottaipattinam's prestige

799
01:20:06,875 --> 01:20:09,416
Commander-in-chief, the great Kochadaiiyaan

800
01:20:09,916 --> 01:20:12,375
Welcome. -We do not need your welcome.

801
01:20:12,875 --> 01:20:15,083
Know the reason why we are here.

802
01:20:15,583 --> 01:20:19,416
I know. You have come begging for refuge to your enemy nation.

803
01:20:19,916 --> 01:20:20,458
You have come here to beg.

804
01:20:20,958 --> 01:20:21,916
We have not come seeking refuge.

805
01:20:22,416 --> 01:20:23,875
We are here to give you a chance.

806
01:20:24,375 --> 01:20:24,916
What could that be?

807
01:20:25,416 --> 01:20:28,000
For the treacherous sin of mixing poison in our food...

808
01:20:28,500 --> 01:20:30,125
to redeem yourselves, we are here to give you a chance.

809
01:20:30,625 --> 01:20:33,875
What we did was not treachery.

810
01:20:34,375 --> 01:20:37,750
It is an act of smart statecraft for the sake of my nation.

811
01:20:38,250 --> 01:20:41,791
Trying to kill our soldiers with poison is not statecraft.

812
01:20:42,291 --> 01:20:43,750
It's an act of cowardice

813
01:20:44,250 --> 01:20:46,125
I wonder how you escaped!

814
01:20:46,625 --> 01:20:47,875
That is the act of the God who created me.

815
01:20:48,375 --> 01:20:49,666
No one can supersede the almighty

816
01:20:50,166 --> 01:20:52,125
Not even the Lord of Death...

817
01:20:52,625 --> 01:20:54,666
Not just in the war of swords, you seem to be a master with words too.

818
01:20:55,166 --> 01:20:58,083
I knew that you would come here for the sake of saving your men.

819
01:20:58,583 --> 01:21:01,250
Give my men the antidotes they need...

820
01:21:01,750 --> 01:21:03,458
and prove yourself to be a worthy king to your subjects

821
01:21:03,958 --> 01:21:05,750
But, we need something in exchange.

822
01:21:06,250 --> 01:21:10,166
All those soldiers who came with you and the ones who are to be saved here...

823
01:21:10,666 --> 01:21:13,791
all those soldiers and your warhorses...

824
01:21:14,291 --> 01:21:17,916
everything must belong to our nation. Tell me, do you accept the terms

825
01:21:18,416 --> 01:21:19,125
Someone call the healer.

826
01:21:19,625 --> 01:21:22,583
Who will save our lives?

827
01:21:23,083 --> 01:21:25,166
My stomach hurts.

828
01:21:25,666 --> 01:21:28,375
I need medicine.

829
01:21:28,875 --> 01:21:32,375
I need medicine.

830
01:21:38,791 --> 01:21:43,625
When will he come back?

831
01:21:44,125 --> 01:21:45,791
We sent them, trusting in you.

832
01:21:46,291 --> 01:21:47,708
How can we live without them? - We have no one left.

833
01:21:48,208 --> 01:21:51,708
Commander, my child...

834
01:21:55,916 --> 01:21:57,625
Mahendra Raj...

835
01:21:58,125 --> 01:22:02,208
this Kochadaiiyaan was born to protect his nation and his people.

836
01:22:02,708 --> 01:22:06,750
As you wish... I will leave all my soldiers right here.

837
01:22:07,250 --> 01:22:08,500
But, on one condition.

838
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:09,958
What is your condition?

839
01:22:10,458 --> 01:22:14,875
You must accept all my men, not as slaves but as warriors.

840
01:22:15,375 --> 01:22:19,458
I promise.

841
01:22:19,958 --> 01:22:22,625
But, do not think this is permanent.

842
01:22:23,125 --> 01:22:29,666
I leave with the belief that I will rescue them from here, someday.

843
01:22:30,166 --> 01:22:31,291
Farewell.

844
01:22:31,791 --> 01:22:37,708
Commander, do not leave us here and go.

845
01:22:38,208 --> 01:22:42,583
Even if we lose our lives, we will not lose you.

846
01:22:43,083 --> 01:22:44,416
Your majesty, why not kill Kochadaiiyaan here?

847
01:22:44,916 --> 01:22:46,208
Fool

848
01:22:46,708 --> 01:22:50,041
He is not a lone man. He is a kingdom.

849
01:22:50,541 --> 01:22:54,041
Commander, do not go

850
01:23:29,833 --> 01:23:30,333
Where are the soldiers?

851
01:23:30,833 --> 01:23:31,625
Commander is coming alone. - What happened?

852
01:23:32,125 --> 01:23:34,250
Where are the soldiers? - I don't know. -Something is not right

853
01:23:34,750 --> 01:23:38,250
Soldiers, today, immediately, at once, gather all the forces.

854
01:23:38,750 --> 01:23:41,083
We need to wage war against Kalingapuri, tomorrow.

855
01:23:41,583 --> 01:23:42,666
My people...

856
01:23:43,166 --> 01:23:45,250
All the soldiers, who came with me, are well.

857
01:23:45,750 --> 01:23:47,875
They are awaiting the day of their return.

858
01:23:48,375 --> 01:23:49,166
Do not worry.

859
01:23:49,666 --> 01:23:51,500
The are the special soldiers of the palace coming this way?

860
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:56,333
It must be something important

861
01:23:56,833 --> 01:23:57,458
Commander...

862
01:23:57,958 --> 01:24:00,083
The king has ordered for your arrest and has summoned you.

863
01:24:00,583 --> 01:24:04,000
Why is Kochadaiyaan being arrested?

864
01:24:04,500 --> 01:24:06,916
What has Kochadaiyaan done wrong? - I don't know either

865
01:24:07,416 --> 01:24:10,583
I cannot believe it

866
01:24:11,083 --> 01:24:12,500
Hey Dharma, come

867
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:13,583
Rana, wait

868
01:24:14,083 --> 01:24:15,083
Dharma, come soon.

869
01:24:15,583 --> 01:24:19,083
Dharma

870
01:24:35,666 --> 01:24:37,833
Salutations, your majesty.

871
01:24:38,333 --> 01:24:39,041
As you wish, your majesty

872
01:24:39,541 --> 01:24:42,583
Kochadaiiyaan, the former commander-in-chief of Kottaipattinam...

873
01:24:43,083 --> 01:24:44,625
you have committed many crimes.

874
01:24:45,125 --> 01:24:46,041
The first crime:

875
01:24:46,541 --> 01:24:48,583
You have lost thousands of our brave soldiers.

876
01:24:49,083 --> 01:24:51,833
Hence, you are considered a war criminal.

877
01:24:52,333 --> 01:24:53,041
The second crime:

878
01:24:53,541 --> 01:24:57,541
You have given up the Persian warhorses that were bought with a lot of money.

879
01:24:58,041 --> 01:25:00,958
Hence, you are considered a political criminal.

880
01:25:01,458 --> 01:25:02,166
The third crime:

881
01:25:02,666 --> 01:25:06,791
As you have voluntarily given up the above to our long-standing arch enemy...

882
01:25:07,291 --> 01:25:09,625
and strengthened their nation...

883
01:25:10,125 --> 01:25:14,041
you are considered a traitor.

884
01:25:14,541 --> 01:25:15,958
Commander-in-chief Kochadaiiyaan...

885
01:25:16,458 --> 01:25:21,416
for the crimes you have been accused of, what do you have to say?

886
01:25:21,916 --> 01:25:25,916
When the explanation and the conclusion is as clear as mirror...

887
01:25:26,416 --> 01:25:27,375
why do I need to give more justification?

888
01:25:27,875 --> 01:25:30,083
Does that mean you agree to your crimes?

889
01:25:30,583 --> 01:25:31,916
I'm awaiting my judgement.

890
01:25:32,416 --> 01:25:34,208
You are talking without fearing for your life.

891
01:25:34,708 --> 01:25:37,166
Because I feared for the lives of my soldiers...

892
01:25:37,666 --> 01:25:39,416
I have had to speak this way.

893
01:25:39,916 --> 01:25:40,708
Do not mistake me.

894
01:25:41,208 --> 01:25:42,750
The investigation ends

895
01:25:43,250 --> 01:25:44,458
As the highest of crimes...

896
01:25:44,958 --> 01:25:48,000
as Kochadaiiyaan has committed the crime of treason...

897
01:25:48,500 --> 01:25:52,000
in this public assembly, I sentence him to death.

898
01:25:59,041 --> 01:26:02,208
I accept your death sentence with all my heart.

899
01:26:02,708 --> 01:26:03,541
But before that...

900
01:26:04,041 --> 01:26:05,583
give me a last chance.

901
01:26:06,083 --> 01:26:06,666
For what?

902
01:26:07,166 --> 01:26:14,041
To gather our forces and to rescue the soldiers and warhorses I left behind.

903
01:26:14,541 --> 01:26:19,791
I am not a fool to trust you and lose these soldiers too.

904
01:26:20,291 --> 01:26:22,208
I lost the trust I had in you.

905
01:26:22,708 --> 01:26:26,208
Tomorrow will be the day of your death sentence.

906
01:26:31,583 --> 01:26:34,750
Do not worry, Gaargi.

907
01:26:35,250 --> 01:26:38,750
Father

908
01:26:45,333 --> 01:26:46,125
Dharma

909
01:26:46,625 --> 01:26:52,708
Our family has protected this nation and its king for generations.

910
01:26:53,208 --> 01:26:54,375
Following in that tradition...

911
01:26:54,875 --> 01:26:56,416
after me, it is your duty to protect your nation and the king.

912
01:26:56,916 --> 01:27:00,416
Your wish is my life's responsibility, father.

913
01:27:14,125 --> 01:27:16,125
Most importantly...

914
01:27:16,625 --> 01:27:18,291
my soldiers are waiting in Kalingapuri...

915
01:27:18,791 --> 01:27:22,708
with the belief that I will rescue them someday.

916
01:27:23,208 --> 01:27:26,708
Your first duty is to rescue them.

917
01:27:48,541 --> 01:27:52,250
Dear Yamuna, look at your father's face for the last time.

918
01:27:52,750 --> 01:27:56,250
Brother-in-law, leaving everyone...

919
01:28:10,625 --> 01:28:15,416
Our army is fighting for their lives behind enemy lines

920
01:28:15,916 --> 01:28:19,750
Move away. Allow me to pass

921
01:28:20,250 --> 01:28:21,125
No permission for children to enter.

922
01:28:21,625 --> 01:28:25,375
Kochadaiiyaan's children Please let us in.

923
01:28:25,875 --> 01:28:29,000
Come, Rana and Dharma.

924
01:28:29,500 --> 01:28:31,416
King of Kottaipattinam...

925
01:28:31,916 --> 01:28:33,833
before your command can be fulfilled...

926
01:28:34,333 --> 01:28:39,416
explain to this assembly of people, what is the crime that my husband committed

927
01:28:39,916 --> 01:28:41,458
Then, fulfill your sentence.

928
01:28:41,958 --> 01:28:44,291
He committed a crime ...

929
01:28:44,791 --> 01:28:47,000
An act of treason.

930
01:28:47,500 --> 01:28:50,500
Treason, it seems. Did you hear it, my people?

931
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:55,375
To save the lives of this nation is an act of treason.

932
01:28:55,875 --> 01:28:59,750
For leaving those soldiers alive in Kalingapuri...

933
01:29:00,250 --> 01:29:03,250
a death sentence for him.

934
01:29:03,750 --> 01:29:04,625
If that is so...

935
01:29:05,125 --> 01:29:10,375
the happiness of the kith and kin of those soldiers is treason

936
01:29:10,875 --> 01:29:12,500
What Gaargi is saying is right. -It is not his fault

937
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:17,333
If a man rescues those soldiers, some day tomorrow...

938
01:29:17,833 --> 01:29:19,333
will you accept those soldiers?

939
01:29:19,833 --> 01:29:20,458
Definitely.

940
01:29:20,958 --> 01:29:22,875
Those soldiers are the wealth of this nation.

941
01:29:23,375 --> 01:29:25,041
If you need to accept those soldiers...

942
01:29:25,541 --> 01:29:28,125
they have to stay alive for that, should they not?

943
01:29:28,625 --> 01:29:30,583
Isn't that what my husband did?

944
01:29:31,083 --> 01:29:32,125
Is that a crime?

945
01:29:32,625 --> 01:29:36,458
She is right. - The king must answer Gaargi's question.

946
01:29:36,958 --> 01:29:38,375
Today, that is considered a crime.

947
01:29:38,875 --> 01:29:41,916
Let someone rescue them tomorrow Then, we will see.

948
01:29:42,416 --> 01:29:43,500
If they are rescued...

949
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,250
will my husband come back to life?

950
01:29:46,750 --> 01:29:49,333
Or... will you bring my husband back from the dead?

951
01:29:49,833 --> 01:29:51,583
Whatever the rescuer wishes for, it shall be granted.

952
01:29:52,083 --> 01:29:55,791
What if he asks for your life? - Long live Kochadaiiyaan

953
01:29:56,291 --> 01:29:57,416
How dare you disrespect the king?

954
01:29:57,916 --> 01:29:58,916
Take her away.

955
01:29:59,416 --> 01:30:02,833
Let go of me or kill me, along with him.

956
01:30:03,333 --> 01:30:05,208
Long live Kochadaiiyaan!

957
01:30:05,708 --> 01:30:08,708
Long live Kochadaiiyaan!

958
01:30:09,208 --> 01:30:14,916
"The Sun burns unselfishly"

959
01:30:15,416 --> 01:30:22,625
"Hence everyone gets light"

960
01:30:23,125 --> 01:30:30,875
"O warrior, you fight altruistically"

961
01:30:31,375 --> 01:30:33,041
"To keep our motherland safe"

962
01:30:33,541 --> 01:30:35,250
Father, where are you going?

963
01:30:35,750 --> 01:30:36,666
To God

964
01:30:37,166 --> 01:30:37,875
I will also come with you.

965
01:30:38,375 --> 01:30:40,833
He has sent word only for me. -When will He call me?

966
01:30:41,333 --> 01:30:43,000
He will call everyone, someday...

967
01:30:43,500 --> 01:30:44,916
as each one's fate dictates.

968
01:30:45,416 --> 01:30:47,916
You have a lot to live and achieve.

969
01:30:48,416 --> 01:30:50,500
Have you achieved it all, father?

970
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:52,583
He has called me, before I could.

971
01:30:53,083 --> 01:30:56,291
Do not worry, father. I will achieve what you couldn't.

972
01:30:56,791 --> 01:31:00,291
Thank you, my child

973
01:31:03,791 --> 01:31:05,583
Father

974
01:31:06,083 --> 01:31:09,583
Father

975
01:31:14,500 --> 01:31:16,375
Ask them to leave me!

976
01:31:16,875 --> 01:31:18,458
Father, Father

977
01:31:18,958 --> 01:31:22,458
Ask them to leave me, your majesty!

978
01:31:31,291 --> 01:31:34,791
Take care, father.

979
01:32:01,791 --> 01:32:04,541
The mad rage to not stop till I had avenged my father's death...

980
01:32:05,041 --> 01:32:07,875
was instilled in me, very young.

981
01:32:08,375 --> 01:32:13,250
But, to rescue Kottaipattinam's soldiers, was my father's last wish.

982
01:32:13,750 --> 01:32:15,250
It was my first duty...

983
01:32:15,750 --> 01:32:19,250
For that I had to go to Kalingapuri.

984
01:32:24,041 --> 01:32:27,541
Rana

985
01:32:42,041 --> 01:32:45,041
You plan on taking my daughter away from me?

986
01:32:45,541 --> 01:32:49,583
You are daydreaming.

987
01:32:50,083 --> 01:32:52,583
I don't daydream. Daydreams don't come true.

988
01:32:53,083 --> 01:32:54,250
From now on, you can never dream.

989
01:32:54,750 --> 01:32:56,125
Necessary only if I happen to sleep.

990
01:32:56,625 --> 01:33:01,041
I stay awake every single moment... only to take revenge on you.

991
01:33:01,541 --> 01:33:03,833
Are you going to take revenge on me?

992
01:33:04,333 --> 01:33:06,625
Do not even think that you can escape from this place.

993
01:33:07,125 --> 01:33:11,166
I am thinking of how you escaped death twice.

994
01:33:11,666 --> 01:33:14,583
First time, when I tried to kill you...

995
01:33:15,083 --> 01:33:17,166
unfortunately my sister's husband, that is, your son...

996
01:33:17,666 --> 01:33:21,041
jumped with you and so, you were saved.

997
01:33:21,541 --> 01:33:24,041
The next time, at the wrong moment, my love, your daughter...

998
01:33:24,541 --> 01:33:27,083
came to your room and saved you.

999
01:33:27,583 --> 01:33:29,250
No more opportunities will come your way.

1000
01:33:29,750 --> 01:33:30,958
Your beloved majesty...

1001
01:33:31,458 --> 01:33:35,416
opportunities do not come our way. It is up to us to create them.

1002
01:33:35,916 --> 01:33:38,916
So that another person like you should never dare to defy me...

1003
01:33:39,416 --> 01:33:40,958
At dawn tomorrow...

1004
01:33:41,458 --> 01:33:46,166
in the midst of the people, you will be sentenced to death.

1005
01:33:46,666 --> 01:33:48,875
In the midst of people, a death sentence for me?

1006
01:33:49,375 --> 01:33:50,291
If those same people wish so...

1007
01:33:50,791 --> 01:33:54,166
they can impose a death sentence to that death itself.

1008
01:33:54,666 --> 01:33:56,125
Rana

1009
01:33:56,625 --> 01:34:01,291
Not just in form... even deep in your heart you are the same Kochadaiiyaan

1010
01:34:01,791 --> 01:34:03,375
It is his blood in my veins...

1011
01:34:03,875 --> 01:34:05,708
That is how it will be!

1012
01:34:06,208 --> 01:34:07,791
"Rana"

1013
01:34:08,291 --> 01:34:09,833
"Rana"

1014
01:34:10,333 --> 01:34:11,666
"Rana"

1015
01:34:12,166 --> 01:34:16,125
"Rana"

1016
01:34:16,625 --> 01:34:18,833
Men are not needed to guard him anymore.

1017
01:34:19,333 --> 01:34:22,833
Replace them with wild beasts!

1018
01:34:33,916 --> 01:34:34,833
Be careful with the sword

1019
01:34:35,333 --> 01:34:38,833
We need to win tomorrow

1020
01:34:42,625 --> 01:34:45,375
Your majesty, the spies have informed that...

1021
01:34:45,875 --> 01:34:51,458
Kalingapuri's forces crossed our border, to wage war on us.

1022
01:34:51,958 --> 01:34:54,750
Prepare all our forces immediately.

1023
01:34:55,250 --> 01:34:56,000
Forgive us, commander

1024
01:34:56,500 --> 01:34:57,916
We will not fight without Rana

1025
01:34:58,416 --> 01:35:01,208
Without the hero who secured our lives, we will not step into the battlefield.

1026
01:35:01,708 --> 01:35:04,583
Without a wise leader, we will only walk to our own doom.

1027
01:35:05,083 --> 01:35:07,583
They are refusing to fight?

1028
01:35:08,083 --> 01:35:08,291
The reason?

1029
01:35:08,791 --> 01:35:09,625
The majority of our army...

1030
01:35:10,125 --> 01:35:12,833
consists of slaves rescued by Rana, their relatives and friends .

1031
01:35:13,333 --> 01:35:15,541
That is why their loyalties lie with Rana.

1032
01:35:16,041 --> 01:35:20,750
So, without 'Kochadaiiyaan' Rana Ranvijay, we do not have a nation, is it?

1033
01:35:21,250 --> 01:35:23,125
If the nation is in danger...

1034
01:35:23,625 --> 01:35:26,875
Kochadaiiyaan's family would come and fight.

1035
01:35:27,375 --> 01:35:31,958
It is in Rana's flash of the sword, the breath of this nation resides.

1036
01:35:32,458 --> 01:35:34,125
Please release Rana, your majesty.

1037
01:35:34,625 --> 01:35:38,125
Are you asking the king to release the man who came to kill him?

1038
01:37:25,583 --> 01:37:28,916
Rana has escaped from the prison, your majesty.

1039
01:37:29,416 --> 01:37:29,916
What?

1040
01:37:30,416 --> 01:37:34,375
No matter where he hides, Rana has to be caught immediately.

1041
01:37:34,875 --> 01:37:38,708
We will discuss about war preparations later.

1042
01:37:39,208 --> 01:37:41,291
But first... Rana!

1043
01:37:41,791 --> 01:37:44,458
As you command, your majesty.

1044
01:37:44,958 --> 01:37:48,291
By getting angry, we cannot get what we want, your majesty.

1045
01:37:48,791 --> 01:37:52,708
Shall I give you a suggestion?

1046
01:37:53,208 --> 01:37:57,083
Do you remember what the astrologer said about your daughter's horoscope?

1047
01:37:57,583 --> 01:38:02,208
If we are to avoid the impending war on Kottaipattinam...

1048
01:38:02,708 --> 01:38:06,458
you should do as I say.

1049
01:38:06,958 --> 01:38:09,458
Why? Why the sudden talks of negotiation?

1050
01:38:09,958 --> 01:38:14,458
Has Ripudhaman gotten scared seeing our magnificent forces?

1051
01:38:14,958 --> 01:38:19,125
He is more scared of internal issues than he is, of you.

1052
01:38:19,625 --> 01:38:20,666
That is why, wanting to negotiate peace...

1053
01:38:21,166 --> 01:38:22,750
How? What does he offer?

1054
01:38:23,250 --> 01:38:24,833
How much land? How much wealth?

1055
01:38:25,333 --> 01:38:27,250
He does not desire to negotiate with land and money.

1056
01:38:27,750 --> 01:38:34,791
He wishes to offer his only daughter to your son and strike a marriage alliance.

1057
01:38:35,291 --> 01:38:38,166
So, you say, in the name of an alliance, he wants to surrender.

1058
01:38:38,666 --> 01:38:41,083
You may call it, however you want.

1059
01:38:41,583 --> 01:38:42,958
Veera Bhadra...

1060
01:38:43,458 --> 01:38:44,250
what is your decision?

1061
01:38:44,750 --> 01:38:47,041
If they will hand over Rana Ranvijay to me...

1062
01:38:47,541 --> 01:38:48,541
I will agree to anything and everything.

1063
01:38:49,041 --> 01:38:49,666
Another important condition.

1064
01:38:50,166 --> 01:38:55,416
The wedding should take place at the border of our nations.

1065
01:38:55,916 --> 01:38:59,416
Why has our enemy nation's king come here with his forces?

1066
01:39:14,166 --> 01:39:16,958
My dear people of this nation!

1067
01:39:17,458 --> 01:39:18,708
Succeeding me...

1068
01:39:19,208 --> 01:39:23,541
I bestow upon her the right to rule Kottaipattinam...

1069
01:39:24,041 --> 01:39:28,250
and proclaim that my daughter Vadhana to be the crown princess...

1070
01:39:28,750 --> 01:39:32,250
in front of the people from both the nations.

1071
01:39:32,750 --> 01:39:34,208
He has not been making right decisions these days.

1072
01:39:34,708 --> 01:39:37,625
The king should not marry our princess with our enemy nation's prince...

1073
01:39:38,125 --> 01:39:40,000
Now, shall we proceed with the wedding?

1074
01:39:40,500 --> 01:39:43,166
I need to talk to my subjects first.

1075
01:39:43,666 --> 01:39:45,166
O' brave warriors from Kalingapuri...

1076
01:39:45,666 --> 01:39:49,166
Kottaipattinam which was our arch-enemy for many years now...

1077
01:39:49,666 --> 01:39:53,875
Today, by offering the hand of their princess to your prince Veera Bhadra...

1078
01:39:54,375 --> 01:39:56,583
they are actually offering their entire nation to us.

1079
01:39:57,083 --> 01:40:01,041
Your prince is to be the king of their nation.

1080
01:40:01,541 --> 01:40:02,333
Long live the new king of Kottaipattinam, Veera Bhadra!

1081
01:40:02,833 --> 01:40:05,500
So, the prince of Kalingapuri is going to be our king?

1082
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,833
Father, they have fulfilled your condition.

1083
01:40:09,333 --> 01:40:10,833
But as per my condition...

1084
01:40:11,333 --> 01:40:14,708
they have not yet handed over 'Kochadaiiyaan' Rana Ranvijay to me.

1085
01:40:15,208 --> 01:40:18,083
Fearing his punishment, he is hiding somewhere within the kingdom.

1086
01:40:18,583 --> 01:40:22,083
We will hand over that coward once he is caught.

1087
01:40:26,500 --> 01:40:27,541
Look Rana is here.

1088
01:40:28,041 --> 01:40:29,708
Look our commander-in-chief Rana Ranvijay is here.

1089
01:40:30,208 --> 01:40:31,291
Our brave warrior is here.

1090
01:40:31,791 --> 01:40:35,291
Rana!

1091
01:40:51,916 --> 01:40:52,583
Rana!

1092
01:40:53,083 --> 01:40:54,833
You better surrender yourself.

1093
01:40:55,333 --> 01:40:58,125
This is the king's decree.

1094
01:40:58,625 --> 01:41:01,125
Without the people, there is no nation or king.

1095
01:41:01,625 --> 01:41:03,833
He, who rules just the land, is not a king.

1096
01:41:04,333 --> 01:41:07,291
Only he, who rules the hearts of people, is a king.

1097
01:41:07,791 --> 01:41:10,458
Who are you to judge if I am a king or not?

1098
01:41:10,958 --> 01:41:12,625
You yourself are a sentenced criminal

1099
01:41:13,125 --> 01:41:15,208
And you are a criminal who is about to be sentenced.

1100
01:41:15,708 --> 01:41:17,000
I am a criminal? -Yes

1101
01:41:17,500 --> 01:41:20,750
For leaving behind, a mere 3,000 soldiers in the enemy nation...

1102
01:41:21,250 --> 01:41:25,875
you called my father Kochadaiiyaan, a traitor and killed him.

1103
01:41:26,375 --> 01:41:27,416
Today, to that same enemy nation...

1104
01:41:27,916 --> 01:41:30,875
you are about to hand over the entire kingdom of Kottaipattinam.

1105
01:41:31,375 --> 01:41:33,458
So, who will you be? -Highest traitor of the nation

1106
01:41:33,958 --> 01:41:36,666
He is a highest traitor of the nation!

1107
01:41:37,166 --> 01:41:39,208
He is a highest traitor of the nation!

1108
01:41:39,708 --> 01:41:40,916
Stop it

1109
01:41:41,416 --> 01:41:44,541
Is your drama done and over with?

1110
01:41:45,041 --> 01:41:48,083
You were the one who set the stage for it and started it.

1111
01:41:48,583 --> 01:41:52,000
The one who is about sit down here and finish it... is Rana.

1112
01:41:52,500 --> 01:41:54,458
I have seen you perform since you were a child

1113
01:41:54,958 --> 01:41:57,708
You are skilled, I know that well

1114
01:41:58,208 --> 01:42:02,250
Yes, I was born to do that. Time is irrelevant.

1115
01:42:02,750 --> 01:42:05,833
As long as I live, there will be no end to this handy talent of mine!

1116
01:42:06,333 --> 01:42:09,083
There will be no end to our enmity too!

1117
01:42:09,583 --> 01:42:11,500
Soldiers of Kalingapuri...

1118
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,916
attack and chase these people away...

1119
01:42:15,416 --> 01:42:16,250
and capture that Rana.

1120
01:42:16,750 --> 01:42:19,375
This is not a crowd that will run away, fearing your soldiers.

1121
01:42:19,875 --> 01:42:22,625
This is the crowd that is about to attack and chase you away.

1122
01:42:23,125 --> 01:42:25,166
Lions of Kottaipattinam...

1123
01:42:25,666 --> 01:42:29,166
show them your true form today.

1124
01:42:38,416 --> 01:42:39,416
Drive, drive it fast.

1125
01:42:39,916 --> 01:42:43,416
Whip it fast Drive it smooth

1126
01:43:11,916 --> 01:43:13,250
Let us leave, your highness.

1127
01:43:13,750 --> 01:43:18,958
Dare to behold our nation's chariotry, elephantry, cavalry and infantry?

1128
01:43:19,458 --> 01:43:21,416
Attack!

1129
01:43:21,916 --> 01:43:25,416
Hail Lord Shiva, God of the Gods!

1130
01:47:44,083 --> 01:47:46,458
Because the nation more important than friendship.

1131
01:47:46,958 --> 01:47:50,208
The nation more important than friendship.

1132
01:47:50,708 --> 01:47:52,583
That is what you told me.

1133
01:47:53,083 --> 01:47:54,333
Your highness, we have lost.

1134
01:47:54,833 --> 01:47:56,333
We have no option other than to retreat.

1135
01:47:56,833 --> 01:48:00,333
Come, your highness.

1136
01:50:36,041 --> 01:50:42,000
After me, it is your duty to protect your nation and the king.

1137
01:50:42,500 --> 01:50:46,000
Dharma
