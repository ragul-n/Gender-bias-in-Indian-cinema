1
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,200
Greetings, Father.

2
00:02:50,624 --> 00:02:53,624
Greetings, dear, greetings.

3
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,000
Salma, dear!

4
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:11,310
After God if i've remembered
anyone then its you.

5
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:16,191
After your prayers whenever
you've remembered...

6
00:03:16,796 --> 00:03:20,061
...your daughter, you've always
found her like your shadow.

7
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:23,364
...I've seen that happening
since Salma's childhood.

8
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:28,031
Midwife..
after Salma's mother's death..

9
00:03:28,842 --> 00:03:31,436
...you've taken care of her
since her childhood.

10
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:35,744
The favour you've done by
taking care of her as your own..

11
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:38,442
...I can never repay you for that.

12
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:42,452
Sire, it's the Almighty
who brings you up..

13
00:03:43,523 --> 00:03:45,991
...we humans are just the means.

14
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:48,588
And as far as favour
is concerned..

15
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,500
... you can repay now.

16
00:03:51,629 --> 00:03:53,129
How do i do that?

17
00:03:54,504 --> 00:03:58,604
Find a Salam for dear Salma.

18
00:03:59,363 --> 00:04:02,163
Because she has reached
marriageable age now.

19
00:04:06,197 --> 00:04:09,097
Aunt, Salim? What do you mean?

20
00:04:09,139 --> 00:04:11,039
Greetings, uncle.
- Bless you, dear Shabana.

21
00:04:11,117 --> 00:04:13,017
Greetings, aunt.
- Bless you, dear.

22
00:04:13,157 --> 00:04:16,057
Uncle, aunt is fond of
that name Salim.

23
00:04:16,232 --> 00:04:20,532
But i asked aunt, what if you
don't find Salim Khan for her?

24
00:04:20,565 --> 00:04:24,065
And what if you got Sarfaraz Khan,
Akbar Khan or Ali Khan?

25
00:04:24,198 --> 00:04:25,498
So what, dear?

26
00:04:25,563 --> 00:04:28,463
We'll change his name and
call him Salim Khan.

27
00:04:31,002 --> 00:04:35,502
Aunt, Salma's wedding
is my last and first wish.

28
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,200
On the day of
my daughter's wedding...

29
00:04:38,328 --> 00:04:41,428
... i'll decorate our region with
so many lamps that...

30
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:45,300
... even the stars in the heaven
will ask each other...

31
00:04:45,322 --> 00:04:47,222
... what's the occasion?
The earth...

32
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:50,331
... is glimmering like us stars?

33
00:04:51,115 --> 00:04:56,715
My daughter Salma's wedding
will be so grand...

34
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:00,158
...that even the neighbouring
tribes and their chieftains..

35
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:02,327
...won't be able to forget it
for years to come.

36
00:05:03,102 --> 00:05:06,401
May God fulfill your wish, sire!

37
00:05:07,206 --> 00:05:11,165
Sire, someone from tribe
has come with a grievance.

38
00:05:11,511 --> 00:05:13,206
Send him in.
- Yes, sire.

39
00:05:15,581 --> 00:05:17,913
Sire, save my daughter, sire!

40
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,611
I'll be ruined, I'll be destroyed.

41
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,400
Save my daughter!
- What happened to her?

42
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,300
Sire, the men from
Gul Khan's tribe...

43
00:05:24,466 --> 00:05:26,366
... have abducted my daughter.

44
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:29,358
How dare they cast an evil eye
upon a girl from tribe?

45
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,900
I will gouge out their eyes.

46
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,500
Dilawar Khan!

47
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,900
Listen, you!

48
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,000
Let go of me!

49
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,600
Save me!

50
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,600
Let go of me!

51
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:00,800
No!

52
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:28,700
Dilawar, Sher Khan
wants this girl!

53
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,300
Just drop your gun and
go back. Or else!

54
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,800
Brother Dilawar!

55
00:06:49,101 --> 00:06:50,401
Goodbye.

56
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,900
Come, Mehboob,
let's take her home.

57
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,500
Uncle, i have hacked
four enemies to death.

58
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:06,100
And i've written justice with
their blood on their land.

59
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,800
And what about Abdul's
daughter Mehjabeen.

60
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,100
She is untouched and safe...

61
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,900
... i have taken her to
uncle Abdul's place.

62
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:13,900
Bravo, Dilawar!
Bravo, my fearless warrior!

63
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,600
What are you thinking, Shabana?

64
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,900
I am thinking about
what i am thinking.

65
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,600
What are you thinking?

66
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:32,000
What if Salim who's a product
of aunt's imagination...

67
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,000
... comes in your dreams...

68
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,100
... or else if he appears
in front of you...

69
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:39,200
... then how will you
express your love?

70
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,100
Stop dreaming, Shabana.

71
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,500
I just want to know
what you will do.

72
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,000
Will you feel embarrassed...

73
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,400
... or will you go and embrace him?

74
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,100
I won't do anything.

75
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:55,000
I will neither feel embarrassed
nor will i embrace him.

76
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:58,000
Then how will you
express you love?

77
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,400
Will you kiss him on the lips?

78
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,800
Shabana!
- Wow!

79
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Your face suddenly glowed
when i talked about kiss.

80
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,300
Shabana, i will just...
- Dear God!

81
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,400
You embraced this pillar as
if he really was Salim.

82
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:15,600
What did you say? Wait, i will
show you... - No, no, Salma.

83
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,200
No, no, where are you going?
- No, no, Salma.

84
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,600
Oh God, what did i do?

85
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:30,100
Forgive me. I just, i just...

86
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,100
Shabana!
What are you waiting for?

87
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,200
Go and get the water!
- Let it be, Salma!

88
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,900
You did the right thing.

89
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:38,400
We have to give something
in order to get.

90
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,200
I had come here to give
you this chicken.

91
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:42,400
And i am taking back this stain.

92
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,900
Here it is.

93
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,700
Brother, this stain won't go away.

94
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,300
How can't it go away?

95
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,400
Come, i'll clean them.

96
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:09,200
Brother, consider this stain
as a gift from Salma.

97
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:12,900
Salma, this is for you.

98
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,900
Thank you.

99
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:24,400
I have spoiled his dress
because of you.

100
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Girls, hurry up now.
- Yes, aunt.

101
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,800
It's brother Dilawar
who likes to eat chilies...

102
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,500
... but it's us who have
to powder them.

103
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,900
He is quite short tempered
by nature.

104
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,500
And if he eats chilies, his anger
will increase even more.

105
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,400
Shabana,
please stitch this button.

106
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,000
Salma, why don't you do that?

107
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
... I'm not good at handling
thread and needle. - Alright.

108
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:02,000
Give it to me, i'll do it.

109
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,200
Brother, why don't you bring
me a nice sister-in-law...

110
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:21,600
... to fulfil your wishes
and commands?

111
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:24,100
Shabana is absolutely right.

112
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:28,900
If one is related then stitching
button becomes really a fun.

113
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,400
Brother, now even Salma
is saying the same thing.

114
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,700
Get married now.

115
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,100
Yes, don't think to much.

116
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:40,200
Your fate will betray
if the right time passes by.

117
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,500
Yes, brother, hurry up.

118
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,600
Like my friend Shehnaz did.

119
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:48,000
Instant engagement
and instant marriage.

120
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,400
Yes, tomorrow we're going
to go Shehnaz's wedding.

121
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,700
And we've to take father's
permission for that.

122
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,400
Dear, i never allowed you go
away from me before this.

123
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,200
Then how can i permit you
to go out of my area...

124
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,500
... for almost four days or so?

125
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:06,000
Father, i have promised
my friend...

126
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,300
... that i'll definitely
attend her wedding.

127
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,200
Do you want me to break
my promise? - No,no.

128
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,400
If my daughter has promised...

129
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,900
... then she'll surely fulfill her
promise. - Thank you, father.

130
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,700
Sire, get used to live
without Salma.

131
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:26,100
Daughter never belongs to us.

132
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,100
God knows when
she'll sit in palanquin...

133
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:30,779
...and go back to
where she belongs.

134
00:11:36,228 --> 00:11:37,286
Sire..

135
00:11:38,397 --> 00:11:40,388
...how will you hide your tears..

136
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:44,100
... when you'll put her
in a palanquin?

137
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,000
Salma?

138
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,100
Greetings.
- Greetings to you.

139
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,400
Salma, who is hiding behind you?

140
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,700
Greetings.
- Greetings.

141
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,500
Greetings. Salma, come.

142
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,200
You've surprised us, didn't you?
- Why?

143
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,100
No one could know...

144
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,000
... that you stole
Sajjad Khan's heart...

145
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,200
... while stealing glances at him.

146
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,900
Well, girls, it's an arrow of love...

147
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,400
... once, it goes,
it never comes back.

148
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:28,400
You're bound to fall for someone
on the occasions of marriages.

149
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:32,000
You're lucky to
have found Sajjad.

150
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:35,200
Pray that even i get some...
- Savage.

151
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,600
Okay, fine with savage,
but at least him.

152
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:40,700
I'll pull his ears and
turn him into an angel.

153
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:44,300
Come, come on! The
get-together is about to begin.

154
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,200
I have written everyone's name.

155
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,600
And i've also included Salma
and Shabana's name.

156
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:51,400
What's this custom?

157
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:54,300
And why did she
write our names?

158
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,400
Salma, it's an age
old custom here.

159
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,300
The bachelor boys
and maiden girls'...

160
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,600
... names are written on
glass of sweets.

161
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:06,600
Then a boy and a girl's
glass are kept together.

162
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:09,300
Then their names are called.

163
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:13,100
Then they come before each
other and greet. That's it.

164
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:16,300
So it means even
i have to greet someone?

165
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,200
Yes, Salma. You know
what happened last time?

166
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:22,300
A bachelor old fellow's name
was connected to me.

167
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,200
I smiled and greeted him.

168
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,500
And that mister fainted
right on the spot.

169
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,900
The get-together begins now.

170
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:33,500
And the first name is
Sultan Khan and Ruksaar.

171
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,900
Oh gosh.

172
00:13:40,352 --> 00:13:42,183
Greetings.
- Greetings.

173
00:13:44,857 --> 00:13:45,983
Salim Khan..

174
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,100
... and Salma.

175
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:50,900
Oh dear God!

176
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:54,300
Don't you get scared! Go,go.

177
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,700
Congrats.

178
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,000
Come on, go.
Come on, go.

179
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,500
Salma! Come out, please.

180
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,100
What happened?

181
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,000
I think God has
fulfilled aunt's wish.

182
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:19,100
Go and see
if it's your prince Salim.

183
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:22,500
No. - Oh come on, he can be
an old uncle for God's sake.

184
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,700
Go and see him.

185
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:28,200
Salma, come out, please.
- You'll have to fulfill this custom.

186
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,300
Salma must face Salim.
Go. Come on, go.

187
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,100
Oh dear God!
- I have seen him!

188
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:11,300
Good. Congrats for Salim.
- Shut up!

189
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:15,300
I couldn't even dream that
your prince will be like this.

190
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,200
Aunt's dream is quite beautiful.

191
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,400
Will you shut up?

192
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,200
Shabana.
- Oh dear God.

193
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,700
And Gujre Khan.

194
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,700
Gujre Khan?
Have i heard this name?

195
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,400
Is he the same old fellow?
Oh God.

196
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:41,500
Is he back again?
Last time he went to hospital...

197
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,500
... i think this time he'll go
to the graveyard.

198
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,900
Greetings!

199
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,900
Greetings.

200
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,300
Goodbye.

201
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,100
What are you thinking, boy?

202
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,200
Mehboob, pal, you know that...

203
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,500
I can slit an enemy's throat.

204
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,600
I can cause bloodshep.

205
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:13,202
But dear, I cant tell
Salma that I love her.

206
00:16:15,107 --> 00:16:19,100
Boy, tell her about
your feelings or..

207
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:22,400
... else you'll regret like me.

208
00:16:23,203 --> 00:16:24,503
What do you mean?

209
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:29,900
I used to love a camel.

210
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:33,500
But i couldn't dare to tell her.

211
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:38,100
And she got married
to my neighbour.

212
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:42,500
And boy, i remained
bachelor forever.

213
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,100
"It's a nature's miracle!"

214
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:39,100
"Oh it's wonderful!"

"Oh it's wonderful!"

221
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:55,300
"My heart salutes her...

222
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:57,500
... and her name is Salma!"

223
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,600
"I lost my heart to Salma!"

224
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:06,144

230
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:05,900
"Don't walk barefoat they
will get soiled."

231
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:11,000
"Your legs will feel the pain
if you walk on the flower."

232
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,200
"Daintiness is your second name."

233

00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,300
Me, first.
- Look, even aunt isn't here.

272
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,200
How can i alone put henna
on everyone's hand?

273
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,700
Wait for a while.
- What if aunt isn't here?

274
00:22:43,428 --> 00:22:44,861
I will put on henna.

275
00:22:47,165 --> 00:22:48,323
Yes..

276
00:22:50,268 --> 00:22:52,429
If any of you ladies

277
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
... on their hands they
can come to me.

278
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,500
I won't go.
- Oh dear God, i feel shy.

279
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:06,600
So, please come forward.

280
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,900
I will put henna. Come to me.

281
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,700
At least, anyone
of you should come...

282
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,400
... so that i can apply henna.

283
00:23:59,471 --> 00:24:01,496
Salim.

284
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:18,500
Show me the hand
with henna on it. - No.

285
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:21,000
Why not?
I want to see it, show me!

286
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:23,900
Alright. See.
- Salim?

287
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:28,600
Everyone thinks
ha has put on henna.

288
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:32,200
This henna has brought
in Salma's life.

289
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:35,600
Greetings. - May God make
your words come true.

290
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Amen! Amed!

291
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:46,000
Salma, you held this plate
with the henna applied hand.

292
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,400
What if it gets apoiled?

293
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,200
Oh dear, what if it gets spoiled?

294
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,900
Today, it's a sweet that has fallen.

295
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,800
I hope you won't fall
down yourself...

296
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:58,700
... or else i'll have to
call Salim himself.

297
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:01,400
Greetings. I am right here.

298
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,500
Sweets?

299
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,500
Salma! Sweets!

300
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:32,300
Oh, this henna is showing
nice colours now.

301
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:35,300
Are you awake?
- Yes, you've fallen in love but...

302
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,000
... it's me who has lost sleep.

303
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:41,300
Dear, the elder say that
if colour of your hanna...

304
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:44,200
... comes out really good then
your would-be hubby...

305
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,100
... must be loving you like a crazy.

306
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,500
Let me say something for it.

307
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,100
Love is a sweet punishment.

308
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,600
It's a beautiful trouble.

309
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:53,100
How's it?!
- Shut up.

310
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:56,300
Your poems are
absolutely nonsense!

311
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,500
They are neither meaningful
nor rhyming.

312
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:00,300
No meanings or no rhymes.

313
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:02,700
But you've your Salim, don't you?

314
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:09,100
Shabana, ask Shehnaz
in private about him.

315
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:12,600
Like, who is he?
And where does he come from?

316
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:15,000
Tomorrow, there is going
to be a programme.

317
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:17,000
Drums will be played,
songs will be sung.

318
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,200
You're going to meet him,
so ask him yourself.

319
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,900
I am feeling little sleepy now.

320
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,200
Okay, good night.

321
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:05,100

... and sway your bodies, girls!"

327
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:31,400
"It's time of union when...

... show them the mirrors."

337
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:18,300
"It's time of union when...

"It's time uf union when...

... the girl meets her hubby."

341
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:11,200
"Your eyes are without kohl...

342
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:15,500
... maybe you're looking for it."

343
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:23,200
"I am looking for a cloud which...

344
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:27,200
... will shower water
without season."

345
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:31,200
"I like the way you move."

346
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,200
"Your charm is killing me."

347
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,600
"Call some doctor, girls."

"They are all fired up,girl...

350
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,000
... let's calm them down!"

351
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:57,200
"It's time of unione when...

352
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
... the girl meets her hubby."

353
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,600
"It's a time of union when...

354
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:10,100
... the girl meets her hubby."

355
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,200
"Your hands are adorned
with henna."

356
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:46,100
" Whose name does it bear?"

357
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:54,000
"The one who taught me love...

358
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,000
... his name adorns my hand!"

359
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:01,700
"You've been caught, dear...

360
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:05,400
... it's time you reveal the truth."

361
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:13,100
"Don't get fooled by what they say!"

362
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:17,200
"Show them the out, girls!"

363
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:20,700
"Don't be too cocky!"

364
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:24,600
"Make us yours, o girls!"

365
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:27,700
"It's a time of union when...

366
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:32,000
... the girl meets her hubby."

367
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:36,300
"It's a time of union when...

368
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:39,300
... the girl meets her hubby."

369
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:48,800
"O girls, beat the drums!"

370
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,300
"Show them how you dance."

371
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:56,300
"Shake your lovely waists...

372
00:31:57,100 --> 00:32:00,300
... and sway your bodies, girls!"

373
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,900
"It's a time of union when...

374
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:07,100

00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:11,500
"It's time of union when...

376
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:15,500

377
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:19,000
"It's time of union when...

"It's time of union when...

380
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:31,300
... the lover meets his beloved."

381
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:25,000
Pal, i really enjoyed the wedding.

382
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:28,400
You were quite rocking in that
song. - Well, that's fine.

383
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:31,200
But i had asked you some
information. What about that?

384
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,200
I kind of forgot to
ask Salma's address...

385
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,100
... due to this wedding and all.

386
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:36,600
And Salma left last night.

387
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,900
She left?

388
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,000
Don't you worry, pal.

389
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,200
I'll write you a letter
as soon as i find her.

390
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,700
Okay, then, good bye.
- Good bye.

391
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:51,300
Greetings, aunt.
- Bless you, dear.

392
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:54,600
So how was your
friend's wedding?

393
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,500
It was great, aunt.
I enjoyed it a lot!

394
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,800
So my daughter is here.

395
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:02,800
Greetings, father.
- Same to you, dear. Same to you.

396
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,800
Salma, without you,
this place was thorny ground.

397
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,100
I was quite worried about you.

398
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:13,300
Father, take a look. I have come
here safe and sound.

399
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,500
You're worried quite
unnecessarily.

400
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:19,500
No, Salma, no.

401
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,800
You're not back safe and sound.

402
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:26,700
My experienced eyes fell me
that you've changed somewhat.

403
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:29,700
Changed? What kind
of change, father?

404
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:32,200
Look into my eyes carefully.

405
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:36,400
You're changed.
Your mind is changed.

406
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,300
My mind is changed.
- Yes.

407
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:42,000
You've forgotten that
whenever you have met me...

408
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:46,100
... you've always let me kiss
your forehead at first.

409
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,100
Oh father.

410
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,800
Oh dear!
- Come, Shabana.

411
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:59,900
I think your love fewer
is increasing now.

412
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:03,500
Salma, what's happening
to your dear heart?

413
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:07,900
Shabana, every heart beat
screams for the beloved's name.

414
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,400
Did you tell aunt about all this?

415
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:15,000
I see! So you're hiding
something from tour aunt, huh?

416
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:20,100
Aunt, your words came true.

417
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,500
Salma met her
Salim at the wedding.

418
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:26,300
And he wrote his name
on her hand.

419
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,400
Salim. Who is he?
- Don't know.

420
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:35,000
Don't know.
- Where does he stay?

421
00:35:35,266 --> 00:35:37,598
Don't know. -I mean he should
be staying somewhere..

422
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:39,266
...shouldn't he?

423
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:40,494
No idea.

424
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:07,900
"I should send flowers."

425
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:11,600
"Yes, i should send flowers...

426
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,200
... my heart says to me!"

427
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:19,000
"But i don't know where you stay."

428
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:22,700
"I have no idea."

429
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:29,300
"I have no idea.
- I should write a letter."

430
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:33,824
I should write a letter..

431
00:36:33,891 --> 00:36:36,257
...my heart says to me!

432
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:41,310
But I don't know where you stay.

433
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:44,000
"I have no idea."

434
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,200
"I have no idea."

435
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:17,800
"You stole a glance at me...

436
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:21,500
... and then you felt shy."

437
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:27,900
"You stole a glance at me...

438
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:31,500
... and then you felt shy."

439
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,600
"you pressed your drape
between your teeth...

440
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:41,600
... and broke into a lovely smile."

441
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:46,600
"I wish to kiss you...

442
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:50,200
"I wish to kiss you...

443
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,500
... my heart says to me."

444
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:57,300
"But i don't know where you stay."

445
00:37:57,408 --> 00:38:00,866
I have no idea <i></i>

446
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:05,344
I have no idea <i></i>

447
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:49,600
"A wind must flow from
your town to mine."

448
00:38:52,300 --> 00:39:01,700
"A wind must flow from
your town to mine."

449
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:08,900
"Keep penning your thoughts
on that gust of wind...

450
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:12,400
... whatever that your
heart goes through."

451
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:16,600
"I feel like flying to you...

452
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:23,200
"I feel like flying
to you my heart says to me!"

453
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:28,200
"But i don't know where you stay."

454
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:31,200
"I have no idea."

455
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,100
"I have no idea."

456
00:39:56,100 --> 00:40:05,200
"I can see your glimpse amidst
the henna on my hand, o beloved."

457
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:14,600
"Your love has made true
what God has ruled."

458
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,500
"O god, bring me
my estranged beloved."

459
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:23,300
"I would die without her."

460
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:29,300
"O God, bring me
my estranged beloved."

461
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:33,200
"I would die without her."

462
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:43,400
"I'm like a firefly ready to die
burning without my beloved."

"I feel like giving up life.

464
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:54,100
"Yes, i feel like giving up life...

00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:59,100
"But i don't know where you stay."

466
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:02,500
"I have no idea."

467
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,500
"I have no idea."

468
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:09,400
"I should send flowers."

469
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:16,500
"I should write a letter
my heart says to me!"

470
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:21,100
"But i don't know where you stay."

471
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:31,200
"I have no idea.
- I have no idea."

472
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:07,200
Salim.

473
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:11,300
Greetings, father.
- Bless you.

474
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:15,500
I know that you love
this instrument...

475
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:19,200
... because your mother
had gifted this to you.

476
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:23,000
But if she would've
been alive then...

477
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,600
... she would have said
the same thing...

478
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,000
... that i am about to say, dear.

479
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,600
You're grown up now.

480
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,200
And tomorrow you'll have
to lead this tribe.

481
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:35,100
And a chief should flaunt
a gun in his hand...

482
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:37,000
... rather than a musical instrument.

483
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,300
Father...

484
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:41,500
... brings bloodshed
and hatred.

485
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:46,300
But these delicate
strings plays the...

486
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:48,000
... harmony of peace and love.

487
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,500
But the times we lifve
in is reverberated by...

488
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:56,200
... gun shots and
clinking of swords.

489
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:02,400
And only guns can curb such
a situation and not music.

490
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:08,100
Salim, i fear that you might
get too last in...

491
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:09,900
... music and forget
about being a chief.

492
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,200
Father, i don't wish to rule our...

493
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:14,400
... tribessmen with guns and swards.

494
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:19,100
But instead i prefer to win
their hearts with love.

495
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:22,900
What will you do
if enemies of our tribes...

496
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:24,100
... force you to use guns?

497
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:28,000
If that happened, father,
then i can drop this...

498
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:31,300
... instrument and take guns
in my hand for justice.

499
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,600
Shabana. Shabana.

500
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:40,500
Come, Salma. - Greetings, aunt.
- Bless you.

501
00:43:41,018 --> 00:43:43,543
Where is Shabana?
- She has gone to our neighbours..

502
00:43:43,854 --> 00:43:45,883
...will be back in a while.
Sit down till then.

503
00:43:58,402 --> 00:44:00,563
Shabana, you silly, let me see.

504
00:44:02,439 --> 00:44:03,929
Why do you need your eyes?

505
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:06,300
You can see him
with your closed eyes too.

506
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:11,600
Yes. That's right.
He always resides in my eyes.

507
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:14,600
Come on, let go now.

508
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:19,000
No, first recite some poetry, only
then i'll let you see.

509
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:20,300
Alright.

510
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,100
Then hear this.

511
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:27,300
May God not bring the day when...

512
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:31,100
... i won't utter your name.

513
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:32,100
Great!

514
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:35,400
O beloved, it's not possible that...

515
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:39,000
... my love story won't
bear your name.

516
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:41,400
Wow, that was great. Nice.

517
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:08,100
Shabana.
- Tell me, dear.

518
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:12,500
Sometimes, i get scared
by Dilawar's eyes.

519
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:14,300
His eyes shouldn't
get you nervous...

520
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:17,000
... his eyes are like that
since he was a little boy.

521
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:27,100
He rendered me senseless...

522
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:33,300
... helpless and witless.

523
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:34,900
Wonderful!

524
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:37,500
He rendered me senseless...

525
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:39,900
... helpless and witless.

526
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:43,300
He gave so many ailments
to my dear friend.

527
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:46,700
Oh, you ruined my poetry,
didn't you?

528
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:49,000
If you're going to scream
like that then...

529
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:51,300
... father might hear it
and i'll be in trouble.

530
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:53,000
Elders are right, aren't they?

531
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:56,500
That love is timid
and always scared.

532
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:59,700
But Shabana,
i don't know who he is...

533
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:04,000
... where does he come from
and where did he go?

534
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:06,800
Lovers don't go away from heart
they wander all over the place...

535
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:09,400
... to return to where they belong.
- When will that day arrive...

536
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:16,100
... when Salim will appear
before my eyes?

537
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:23,700
I fear that he might just be a
part of my dreams and poetry.

538
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:27,500
So tell me, what have you written
as you miss him?

539
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:30,600
I have poetry,
but i can't culminate it.

540
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,600
I think i should go to Mr. Shah...

541
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:36,500
... now only he can help me with it.

542
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:39,500
Tell me, maybe i can help you.

543
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:41,700
Alright, then listen.

544
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:46,700
My beloved took away my life
and my soul from me.

545
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:51,200
My beloved took away my life
and my soul from me.

546
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:59,000
Yes! And then he kissed
Salma while embracing her.

547
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:01,900
You are one hell of a stupid poet.
- Is that right?

548
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:03,500
Then go to Mr. Shah.

549
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:00,800
Brilliant.

550
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,400
Greetings, Mr. Shah.
- Bless you, dear.

551
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:08,600
You've raised new symphony
with this instrument.

552
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:14,600
Played a new tune, which was
never heard before around here.

553
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:17,600
Yes, Mr. Shah,
this tune carries with it...

554
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:20,600
... love, affection and fondness.

555
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:25,500
It's you who craves for love
or it's other way around? - Sir...

556
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:30,400
... does shore touches the waves
or the waves touch the shore.

557
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:34,300
Does shore crave or the waves?

558
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:38,900
I have no idea.
- But if you play such a tune...

559
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:41,300
... then you become like it.

560
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:45,900
Just like olive tree which makes
its way through marble.

561
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,100
I won't ask you about that olive.

562
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:57,900
Because i know that you'll come
to me and tell me that myself.

563
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,300
Don't be afraid, dear...

564
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:03,500
... because the truth is the most...

565
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:06,100
... powerful and the lie
is the weakest...

566
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:08,200
... thing in this world.

567
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,900
Okay, i will leave now.

568
00:49:14,584 --> 00:49:16,347
Goodbye Mr. Shah. Goodbye.

569
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:38,400
Greetings, Mr. Shah.

570
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:40,300
Bless you, dear.

571
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,200
How are you, Salma?

572
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,500
Didn't see you for quite a while.

573
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,100
Well, Mr. Shah, i had gone
away for a wedding.

574
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:50,900
I can't culminate poetry.

575
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:53,200
I must hear the entire poetry.

576
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:55,400
Come,we'll hear it.
- Sure.

577
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:00,600
So, dear, start.
- Yes.

578
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:05,000
He rendered me senseless,
helpless and witless.

579
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:08,200
The stranger left me
with new experience.

580
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:10,700
Wonderful! Wonderful!
Okay, go on.

581
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:14,700
He took some, gave some,
but he was fair and just.

582
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:17,800
But he was fair and just.

583
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:20,900
He gave life and
yet took away one.

584
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:22,500
Wow! Brilliant!
Wonderful! Wonderful!

585
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:24,600
What a beautiful line! Next verse.

586
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,400
He didn't let me think
even for a moment.

587
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:33,300
He didn't let me think
even for a moment.

588
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:37,200
But yet left me with an eon
to lead sleepless nights.

589
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:40,700
Wonderful! A moment
and an eon. Brilliant!

590
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,200
That's quite a wonderful
thought. Tell me more.

591
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:47,500
My beloved took away my life
and my soul from me.

592
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:51,500
Sir, what should be the next line?

593
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:53,800
What's the line?
Took away my life...

594
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,100
... my soul from me.
- From me.

595
00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:00,400
My beloved took away my life
and my soul from me.

596
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:04,400
But his fragrance still
lingers upon me.

597
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:08,200
Wow! Brilliant!
Wonderful! Wonderful!

598
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,100
Who is he, Mr. Shah?

599
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:13,200
He is pupil of mine
just like you.

600
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:15,300
Meer Salim.

601
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:19,600
Sir...

602
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:21,200
... please tell her...

603
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:23,300
... that i didn't say that line.

604
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:26,500
My inanity made me utter it.

605
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:27,700
The poetess is happy...

606
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:30,700
... that not only because
her line is completed...

607
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:33,200
... but also because her
poetry is culminated.

608
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:34,500
Come, dear, come.

609
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:36,800
Oh God.

610
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:39,400
Salim.

611
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:42,700
This is Salma...

612
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,600
... daughter of Chief Aatish Khan.

613
00:51:45,700 --> 00:51:46,800
Greetings.

614
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:49,400
And this is Salim...

615
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:51,600
... son of Chief Gul Khan.

616
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:53,300
Greetings.

617
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:54,900
Ok. Sir...

618
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:56,900
... let me take your leave.

619
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:58,500
Goodbye.

620
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:20,700
Salma...

621
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:25,000
... this is the way which
leads to your house.

622
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:26,500
Now every path...

623
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:29,000
... leads me to my Salim.

624
00:52:29,846 --> 00:52:33,179
And when I reach there,
I know that I belong there..

625
00:52:33,416 --> 00:52:36,214
...I know it belongs to me.
But Salma..

626
00:52:37,254 --> 00:52:40,519
...you're like a poetry
which I can't sing.

627
00:52:40,590 --> 00:52:43,491
I wouldn't be here,
if I was scared.

628
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:46,300
For your love...

629
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:51,700
... i can face anything in this world.

630
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:53,400
Salma...

631
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:56,700
... you are my love...

632
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:01,400
... but its consequences
are nothing but harsh desert...

633
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,700
... where one can't find
his destination.

634
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:10,300
In love, if you even
take one step...

635
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:12,600
... you've reached your destination.

636
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:16,700
Your and our tribes
are separated by...

637
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:19,300
... mighty walls of enmity.

638
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:21,300
Power of love...

639
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:24,400
... can destroy even the walls
as mighty as mountains.

640
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:35,600
This desert always craved
for love and affection.

641
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:40,516
What if our love..
- No, Salim.

642
00:53:42,185 --> 00:53:44,310
We've met to become
one forever.

643
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:48,300
I met you and met my life.

644
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:51,600
I've this feeling of reached
to finality, Salim.

645
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:56,700
So, can you leave behind
your people, your tribe...

646
00:53:57,100 --> 00:53:59,300
... and your world for me?

647
00:53:59,302 --> 00:54:01,302
You're a world to me.

648
00:54:01,805 --> 00:54:07,070
I can leave everything even for
a presence of your shadow.

649
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:42,600
Aunt!

650
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:44,800
Aunt!

651
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:49,400
What's the matter?
My dear girl looks so happy.

652
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:51,900
Yes, aunt, i am really happy.

653
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:55,100
But Salma, dear...

654
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:59,400
... today your happiness looks
quite strange to me.

655
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:04,900
Aunt, today my dreams have
come true, my poetry...

656
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,600
I have become complete.

657
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:11,000
I have found my Salim, aunt.

658
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:13,200
Have you found him?
- Yes.

659
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:15,100
But who is he?

660
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:16,500
Son of Chief Gul Khan.

661
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:21,700
Son of Chief Gul Khan? Salim?

662
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:25,100
Aunt.

663
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:30,100
What's the matter, aunt?

664
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:33,800
You look worried
and confused. Sire...

665
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:36,300
... we have a daughter
who has reached...

666
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:38,600
... marriageable age,
so i'm bound to get worried.

667
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:41,700
I was thinking about Salma's life.

668
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:43,600
No, aunt...

669
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:48,700
I won't even let Salma
think about her life now.

670
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:53,200
I will decide who is going
to be her husband.

671
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:55,100
Yes, yes, sire.

672
00:55:55,900 --> 00:55:58,300
Aunt, come, fix a lunch for us.
I am starving.

673
00:55:58,700 --> 00:56:00,500
Are you hungry?
- Yes. - Come.

674
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,200
Aunt...

675
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:09,800
... the day Salma has come back
from her friend's wedding...

676
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:13,200
... it seems that you want yo see
her getting married.

677
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:14,600
That's right, sire.

678
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:23,400
Salim!

679
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:32,800
Whose name is it?

680
00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:35,200
Who is he?

681
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:36,600
Well...

682
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:38,700
Whose name have you
written on your palm?

683
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:40,100
Greetings, uncle.

684
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:44,100
Uncle, aunt always says that...

685
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:47,300
... no matter what
Salma's husband...

686
00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:50,600
... will be called but we'll change
his name to Salim, right?

687
00:56:51,100 --> 00:56:53,800
That's why i wrote Salim's
name on her palm as a joke.

688
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:02,600
Aunt...

689
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:04,800
... i am extremely enraged to see...

690
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:08,500
... a stranger's name on
my daughter's palm.

691
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:13,400
My mind is agonized over
questions that seem to tormend me.

692
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:15,900
I will never tolerate
a stranger's name...

693
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:17,600
... connected to my
daughter's name.

694
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:19,900
Sire...

695
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:21,200
... they're ignorant...

696
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:22,700
... it's a silly mistake.

697
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:24,600
Please start eating.

698
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:35,300
Aunt...

699
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,600
... are you thinking...

700
00:57:39,100 --> 00:57:40,300
... what am i thinking?

701
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:41,400
No, dear, no...

702
00:57:41,900 --> 00:57:44,200
... our thinking can be the same.

703
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:45,700
Why, aunt?
- Because...

704
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:48,100
... you think about feelings...

705
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:50,500
... and i think about practicality.

706
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:53,600
My age aids me in my thinking...

707
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:58,400
... and your age is tender
and it hampers you.

708
00:57:58,400 --> 00:57:59,700
That means...

709
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:02,700
... you know what am i thinking?

710
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:04,700
Yes, i know.

711
00:58:05,300 --> 00:58:06,700
And i also know that...

712
00:58:07,300 --> 00:58:10,300
... what you think is impossible.

713
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:11,900
Why is that impossible?

714
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:14,600
Because your thoughts...

715
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:17,000
... cannot make our enemy tribe...

716
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:20,400
... forget about their
vendetta of vengeance.

717
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:25,000
Your relation with Salim cannot
turn chief Gul Khan...

718
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:30,400
... and chief Aatish Khan's
enmity into friendship.

719
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:36,500
Your love cannot turn hatred
of tribes into love.

720
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:38,200
But, aunt...

721
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:41,100
... how do you know
what am i thinking?

722
00:58:41,284 --> 00:58:42,376
Dear..

723
00:58:42,619 --> 00:58:44,653
I hadn't given birth to you..

724
00:58:45,388 --> 00:58:47,083
...but I fed and brought you up.

725
00:58:48,091 --> 00:58:50,025
I am not your mother..

726
00:58:51,094 --> 00:58:52,959
...but I am like your mother.

727
00:58:53,463 --> 00:58:55,021
And every mother..

728
00:58:55,700 --> 00:58:57,800
... knows what her baby is...

729
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:03,100
... talking and she
understand them too.

730
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:06,600
But Salma, dear...

731
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:09,000
... last few days,
you've started scaring me.

732
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:11,600
But why are you getting
scared of me, aunt?

733
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:15,200
I think of you as my daughter.

734
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:18,500
And every mother...

735
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:21,300
... wants her daughter to be happy.

736
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:24,000
... and alive.

737
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:26,000
No matter what you think, aunt...

738
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:27,600
... but you'll see...

739
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:29,500
... for sure that...

740
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:32,300
... what i think will
definitely happen.

741
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:35,400
I am really getting scared
of Salma, Mr. Shah.

742
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:39,000
Because she loves Salim?

743
00:59:39,700 --> 00:59:41,100
Chief Aatish Khan...

744
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:44,500
... and Dilawar will never
approve of this.

745
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:47,800
And they will kill Salma?

746
00:59:49,100 --> 00:59:53,800
Shabana, what must be aunt and
Mr. Shah talking about in private?

747
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:56,400
It must be about you and Salim.

748
00:59:57,500 --> 00:59:58,700
About Salim?

749
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,300
"She rendered me...

750
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,400
"Senseless...

751
01:00:07,700 --> 01:00:14,200
... helpless and witless"

752
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:16,200
Salma!

753
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:27,800
"She rendered me senseless,
helpless and witless."

754
01:00:28,091 --> 01:00:36,621
That stranger left me
with new experience.

755
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:39,000
"She rendered me...

756
01:00:39,100 --> 01:00:41,600
... senseless...

757
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:47,500
... helpless and witless."

758
01:01:06,100 --> 01:01:10,600
"He took some, gave some,
but he was fair and just."

759
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:29,200
"He gave life and
yet took away one."

760
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:38,600
"She rendered me senseless
helpless... - And witless."

761
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:08,600
"She didn't let me think
even for a moment."

762
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:15,400
"He didn't let me think
even for a moment."

763
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:25,500
" But yet left me with... - An eon
to lead sleepless nights."

764
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:35,600
"She rendered me senseless
helpless... - And witless."

765
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:58,600
"My beloved took away my life
and my soul from me."

766
01:02:58,975 --> 01:03:04,971
My beloved took away my life
and my soul from me.

767
01:03:05,715 --> 01:03:15,056
But her fragrance still
lingers upon me.

768
01:03:15,324 --> 01:03:24,357
He rendered me senseless
helpless and witless.

769
01:03:24,700 --> 01:03:34,000
"That stranger left me
with new experience."

770
01:04:29,031 --> 01:04:30,089
Salma.

771
01:04:48,700 --> 01:04:50,200
Son, Dilawar...

772
01:04:50,300 --> 01:04:53,400
... who is he?
He plays the music so well.

773
01:04:53,500 --> 01:04:55,600
When i was born, all i heard
was gun shots, aunt.

774
01:04:56,500 --> 01:04:58,400
This music means nothing to me.

775
01:04:59,100 --> 01:05:00,200
Come on, let's go home.

776
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,100
Come, Salma.

777
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,800
Salim.

778
01:05:33,100 --> 01:05:34,200
Mr, Shah.

779
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:38,500
Mr. Shah...

780
01:05:40,300 --> 01:05:41,400
I felt as...

781
01:05:42,300 --> 01:05:44,100
... if i witnessed a storm.

782
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:47,300
A storm was indeed here,
but it has left.

783
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:49,400
But Salim...

784
01:05:50,300 --> 01:05:52,800
... today your instrument played...

785
01:05:53,600 --> 01:05:56,100
... Salma's poetry through its tunes.
- Mr. Shah.

786
01:05:57,300 --> 01:05:58,400
You have told me...

787
01:05:59,300 --> 01:06:01,400
... that olive roots make their
way into marble.

788
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:04,700
It has happened, Mr. Shah.

789
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:08,200
But i want to know
the truth from you.

790
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:10,200
What's the truth?

791
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,200
Salma is my truth.

792
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:14,300
And what about Salma?

793
01:06:15,237 --> 01:06:16,261
It's same for her.

794
01:06:16,872 --> 01:06:19,432
This decision isn't that easy one.

795
01:06:21,310 --> 01:06:22,334
I know.

796
01:06:22,878 --> 01:06:25,142
This path is strewn with dangers.

797
01:06:26,315 --> 01:06:30,115
The olive root can make
their way through marble..

798
01:06:31,253 --> 01:06:34,450
...but it can't pierce the
mighty wall of iron.

799
01:06:34,700 --> 01:06:37,500
If flower can pierce
through diamond...

800
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:39,400
... then won't our love...

801
01:06:39,700 --> 01:06:42,200
... be able to destroy enmity
between two tribes?

802
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,200
What you think...

803
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:46,800
... is quite possible.

804
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:48,700
Go.

805
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:52,100
Tell your father that
he should go to...

806
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:55,100
... chief Aatish Khan to ask
Salma's hand in marriage.

807
01:06:55,700 --> 01:06:56,900
Yes, Mr. Shah.

808
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,200
Come, son.

809
01:07:00,100 --> 01:07:01,200
Mother...

810
01:07:02,100 --> 01:07:03,400
I want to tell you something.

811
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:04,800
Tell me, dear.

812
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:06,500
Mother...

813
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:08,100
... every mother who
has young son...

814
01:07:08,500 --> 01:07:10,600
... wants to bring
daughter-in-law to their home.

815
01:07:11,100 --> 01:07:13,300
So have you found one for me?

816
01:07:13,700 --> 01:07:15,000
Yes, mother.

817
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:16,600
Tell me, who is she?

818
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:21,100
Just go to uncle's house
right away.

819
01:07:23,100 --> 01:07:24,200
Alright?

820
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,300
So you want to marry Salma?

821
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:30,800
Even i like Salma.
- So mother...

822
01:07:31,100 --> 01:07:32,300
... go at once to uncle's house.

823
01:07:32,300 --> 01:07:34,600
Alright... Okay. I will go.

824
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:36,300
Salim!

825
01:07:39,700 --> 01:07:42,800
Aatish Khan thinks that
i've murdered his brother-in-law.

826
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:45,500
And you say that...
- But father,

827
01:07:46,100 --> 01:07:47,600
I know that you didn't murder him.

828
01:07:47,600 --> 01:07:49,300
Will that make any difference?

829
01:07:52,100 --> 01:07:54,100
Aatish Khan is my enemy.

830
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:59,600
And my enemy's daughter
can't become my daughter-in-law.

831
01:08:00,900 --> 01:08:03,600
Lot of blood has been
shed between us.

832
01:08:04,300 --> 01:08:07,000
Loots of people have died.
- But, father...

833
01:08:08,100 --> 01:08:09,400
... think like a father...

834
01:08:10,500 --> 01:08:11,600
... and not a chief.

835
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:13,300
How can i not think like a chief?

836
01:08:14,100 --> 01:08:15,200
How can i?

837
01:08:15,700 --> 01:08:18,000
I am chef of this tribe.

838
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:20,600
People from Aatish Khan's...

839
01:08:20,700 --> 01:08:22,300
... tribe have spilled blood
of my people.

840
01:08:22,300 --> 01:08:24,000
How can i forget those elders...

841
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:26,600
... who lost their lives
for this enmity?

842
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:30,400
I cannot betray my fore father
who lost their lives!

843
01:08:30,500 --> 01:08:32,300
Think about sometime, father.

844
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:34,100
Think about sometime.

845
01:08:35,100 --> 01:08:36,400
You are not only a chief...

846
01:08:37,100 --> 01:08:38,300
...but also a father too.

847
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:42,300
This alliance can end
the age old enmity.

848
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:45,300
Enmity will turn into friendship.

849
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:49,400
A simple alliance cannot
end the age old enmity!

850
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:52,600
A hand dripping
with others blood...

851
01:08:53,300 --> 01:08:55,300
... cannot be adorned with henna.

852
01:08:55,400 --> 01:08:58,500
Flowers of love can bloom
on the bloodied hand.

853
01:08:59,500 --> 01:09:00,700
If you take first step...

854
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:03,600
... from this path of enmity...

855
01:09:08,100 --> 01:09:10,500
Salim? - Yes, father.
- Tell me something.

856
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:14,300
Do you want to marry
that girl just because...

857
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:17,200
... you want to end this feud?
- Father.

858
01:09:18,500 --> 01:09:20,100
I won't lie to you...

859
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
... because i have never
lied to you.

860
01:09:25,300 --> 01:09:26,800
I am in love with Salma.

861
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,500
And Salma?
- She can't live...

862
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:34,600
... without me, father.
- She can't live without you...

863
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:38,300
... and so can't you?

864
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,100
Yes, father.

865
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:44,700
Is she ready to separate
from her tribe?

866
01:09:45,300 --> 01:09:46,500
Can she leave her father?

867
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:49,300
Yes, father.
- And you?

868
01:09:51,300 --> 01:09:54,400
I can do anything to get her.
Anything.

869
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:56,500
That's what i was afraid of.

870
01:09:57,200 --> 01:09:58,400
That's it.

871
01:10:00,300 --> 01:10:04,400
That instrument was surely
going to play some new tune.

872
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:06,600
Through my music...

873
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:10,700
... i always think of peace
and love, father.

874
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:13,400
I know that...

875
01:10:13,700 --> 01:10:15,200
... you are just like my mother.

876
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:17,800
You hate violence.

877
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:20,700
You don't loath enmity.

878
01:10:21,700 --> 01:10:24,700
Your heart cries out when you
see murder and bloodshep.

879
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:28,300
Even you want peace...

880
01:10:29,300 --> 01:10:30,400
... and friendship...

881
01:10:31,300 --> 01:10:33,200
... you want love and happiness.

882
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:40,600
You put me in dilemma.
Salim, dear.

883
01:10:44,300 --> 01:10:48,100
I can think of sharring
your happiness.

884
01:10:52,300 --> 01:10:54,600
Maybe i could just think...

885
01:10:55,800 --> 01:10:57,400
... about it and could do nothing.

886
01:10:59,500 --> 01:11:02,300
Brother, i am here to ask
your happiness from you.

887
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:03,500
Sister Zainat...

888
01:11:03,900 --> 01:11:06,800
... our happiness belongs to you.

889
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:11,100
Brother, i am here to ask you
something for Dilawar, my son.

890
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:16,300
So it means that Mr. Shah
approves of your love?

891
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:20,300
Yes, Mr. Shah asked him
to go to his father...

892
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:22,700
... and asked him to come
to my father.

893
01:11:23,100 --> 01:11:24,500
Him? What do you mean by him?

894
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:26,100
It's him.

895
01:11:26,500 --> 01:11:27,700
Oh i see.

896
01:11:28,300 --> 01:11:30,200
You aren't married and yet you...

897
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:32,400
... stopped calling him by names.

898
01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:34,300
No, it's not the case.

899
01:11:34,300 --> 01:11:36,100
Okay, then, say, Salim.

900
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:38,700
Don't talk loudly.
- No one's going to hear that.

901
01:11:38,700 --> 01:11:41,200
They're brothers and sisters,
and they're quite busy chitchatting.

902
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:42,400
What are they talking about?

903
01:11:42,500 --> 01:11:43,600
No, idea.

904
01:11:43,700 --> 01:11:46,600
Mother said she wanted to ask
something important to uncle.

905
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:47,800
Sister Zainat...

906
01:11:48,300 --> 01:11:50,800
... who can be dear to me
more than Dilawar?

907
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:54,600
And i also know that Dilawar
will take good care of Salma.

908
01:11:55,800 --> 01:11:58,400
But i need two day's
time to declare this.

909
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:00,700
I already know your
decision, brother.

910
01:12:00,900 --> 01:12:02,500
Now how can i not give
you two day's time?

911
01:12:02,500 --> 01:12:05,000
Greetings, aunt.
- Bless you, dear.

912
01:12:05,500 --> 01:12:08,600
What is it, aunt? You're looking
quite happy today.

913
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:12,800
Salma, dear, i am here to ask
happiness from my brother.

914
01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:16,300
One must never refrain from
spreading happiness.

915
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:18,200
We should always
spread happiness...

916
01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:19,500
... it doubles our own happiness.

917
01:12:19,500 --> 01:12:21,600
Did you see, our daughter
has grown up now?

918
01:12:29,645 --> 01:12:32,944
Greetings, chief.
- Same to you.

919
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:45,600
Come, Gul Khan. Come.

920
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:51,600
So what brings you here?

921
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:53,200
There is a reason, chief.

922
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:55,800
I wish that feud between
Aatish Khan...

923
01:12:56,700 --> 01:12:59,500
... and us should end.

924
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:06,700
May God forgive me!

925
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,200
I have always wished
that these two warring...

926
01:13:10,300 --> 01:13:12,400
... tribes should come together.

927
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:14,800
But i haven't found
any way till now.

928
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:16,100
Chief...

929
01:13:16,300 --> 01:13:18,600
I can show you the
way to friendship.

930
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:20,200
What is it?

931
01:13:20,300 --> 01:13:21,400
Chief...

932
01:13:22,100 --> 01:13:25,300
... my son Salim and
Aatish Khan's daughter...

933
01:13:26,300 --> 01:13:28,500
... are madly in love
with each other.

934
01:13:29,200 --> 01:13:31,300
If they are wedded...

935
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:34,800
... then this feud will end.

936
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:38,600
That's great, Gul Khan, brilliant.

937
01:13:40,100 --> 01:13:41,500
You opened my eyes!

938
01:13:42,500 --> 01:13:44,400
You've thought of such
a beautiful way...

939
01:13:44,500 --> 01:13:46,400
... to bring together two
tribes. Brilliant!

940
01:13:47,100 --> 01:13:49,300
Go, Gul Khan, go right away.

941
01:13:49,300 --> 01:13:51,500
Send a message to
Aatish Khan and...

942
01:13:51,900 --> 01:13:54,700
... ask for Salma's hand
in marriage for Salim.

943
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:56,700
Sire...

944
01:13:57,200 --> 01:14:00,300
... you've strengthened my resolve
by approving this alliance.

945
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:04,300
Thank a millions to you.

946
01:14:05,300 --> 01:14:06,600
Now i'll take your leave.

947
01:14:07,300 --> 01:14:09,300
Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

948
01:14:17,300 --> 01:14:19,000
I am not getting this.

949
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:22,400
A man who always
instigated two tribes...

950
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,700
... today he is trying
to be a peacemaker?

951
01:14:24,900 --> 01:14:26,500
Rashid, i am doing...

952
01:14:27,500 --> 01:14:30,200
... what chiefs of all the
time have done.

953
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:31,500
Now what have they been doing?

954
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:34,600
If these two tribes
come together then...

955
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:36,700
It's us who is going to be
smacked in the process.

956
01:14:36,700 --> 01:14:39,600
May God forgive me!

957
01:14:41,500 --> 01:14:44,100
You'll never understand
my moves, Rashid.

958
01:14:45,500 --> 01:14:50,300
When i trap someone, i make
him suffer for all his life.

959
01:14:51,300 --> 01:14:53,300
I have sent Gul Khan
to Aatish Khan so...

960
01:14:53,300 --> 01:14:55,600
... that their enmity will even
become more stronger.

961
01:14:55,700 --> 01:14:59,300
Now just wait and
watch how it destroys them.

962
01:14:59,300 --> 01:15:01,700
Chief, if Aatish Khan
agrees to his alliance...

963
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,500
... then his tribe will be happier.

964
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:07,400
It will never happen, Rashid.

965
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:11,500
I know that Aatish Khan
never does anything...

966
01:15:12,600 --> 01:15:14,400
... without my permission.

967
01:15:15,200 --> 01:15:17,200
And that too in support
of Gul Khan?

968
01:15:17,900 --> 01:15:19,200
No way!
- Father....

969
01:15:19,500 --> 01:15:20,500
Shall i say something?

970
01:15:21,100 --> 01:15:23,700
Halaku, silence is good
for your health.

971
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,300
Uncle, it was me
who wanted Salma.

972
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:34,000
How could this Salim interfere
between ud? - Idiot...

973
01:15:34,100 --> 01:15:35,200
... i mean, Halaku...

974
01:15:35,500 --> 01:15:37,100
... at first, you lost your heart
to Shabnam...

975
01:15:37,500 --> 01:15:39,000
... then Shehnaz...

976
01:15:39,200 --> 01:15:40,600
... and then Shabana.

977
01:15:40,600 --> 01:15:43,100
You lost your heart to them
and one by one...

978
01:15:43,100 --> 01:15:45,400
... they committed suicide.
They are all dead. - Uncle....

979
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,400
I swear by you.

980
01:15:47,900 --> 01:15:49,500
I won't let Salma die.

981
01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:51,100
I will marry her.

982
01:15:51,100 --> 01:15:52,800
How can you put your hand
over my heart...

983
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:53,900
... and take a false oath?

984
01:15:53,900 --> 01:15:55,200
What if my heart stops beating?

985
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:58,100
Do you think it's only you
who wants Salma?

986
01:15:58,400 --> 01:16:00,400
Even i want her too.

987
01:16:01,700 --> 01:16:02,900
Mother.

988
01:16:03,300 --> 01:16:05,000
What is it?
- Mother.

989
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:07,000
Tell me, what is it?

990
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:08,400
You know, what i'm going
to ask you!

991
01:16:08,500 --> 01:16:10,300
How do i know
what you want to ask?

992
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:12,600
Mother, did you go
to uncle's house?

993
01:16:12,900 --> 01:16:14,400
I did.
- What did he say?

994
01:16:15,200 --> 01:16:16,500
What will he say?

995
01:16:16,600 --> 01:16:18,100
We chitchatted a lot.

996
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:20,600
Mother, look at me and
tell what did he say?

997
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:24,200
That's what i wanted to know.

998
01:16:25,400 --> 01:16:26,500
Brother told me that...

999
01:16:26,900 --> 01:16:29,000
... he will declare his decision
after two days.

1000
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:30,100
Mother!

1001
01:16:30,900 --> 01:16:33,300
Greetings, sire!
- Greetings! Greetings.

1002
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:39,200
Greetings, chief.
- Same to you!

1003
01:16:40,500 --> 01:16:44,200
Happy to see, you chief
Aatish Khan. Happy to see you.

1004
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:46,600
Chief, i have come here
for you advice...

1005
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,200
... as well as for your permission.
- Tell me, Aatish Khan...

1006
01:16:49,200 --> 01:16:50,300
Sire!

1007
01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:51,800
My sister Zainat has...

1008
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:53,800
... asked my daughter
Salma's hand...

1009
01:16:54,300 --> 01:16:55,800
... in marriage for her son Dilawar.

1010
01:16:56,300 --> 01:16:59,300
Dilawar is brave young man.

1011
01:17:00,100 --> 01:17:03,000
No match can be better
than this for Salma.

1012
01:17:03,100 --> 01:17:04,200
Chief Aatish Khan....

1013
01:17:04,500 --> 01:17:07,100
Yes. Isn't that nice?

1014
01:17:07,900 --> 01:17:10,200
I mean your daughter will
remain in your own family.

1015
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:13,100
Chief Aatish Khan....

1016
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:18,000
... go to your sister's
place with gifts.

1017
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:20,300
Don't be late even for a moment.

1018
01:17:20,700 --> 01:17:23,300
Start arranging for Salma's
wedding as soon as possible....

1019
01:17:23,300 --> 01:17:24,700
... so that i could be....

1020
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
... part of that wedding.

1021
01:17:28,300 --> 01:17:31,300
That's good, chief. I just wished
for your permission.

1022
01:17:32,100 --> 01:17:33,400
Now i would take your leave.

1023
01:17:33,900 --> 01:17:35,600
Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

1024
01:17:44,700 --> 01:17:45,800
Father.

1025
01:17:46,600 --> 01:17:48,500
Shall i say something?
- Say it.

1026
01:17:49,300 --> 01:17:51,000
Father, what's going on?

1027
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:55,000
You've asked chief Gul to sak
Salma's hand in marriage.

1028
01:17:55,300 --> 01:17:57,100
And you have asked
chief Aatish Khan to....

1029
01:17:57,200 --> 01:18:00,400
... marry Salma to Dilawar Khan.

1030
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,600
Chief, was it an advice
or a war declaration?

1031
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:07,000
May God forgive me!

1032
01:18:08,500 --> 01:18:11,100
Chief is always the
person who maintains...

1033
01:18:11,200 --> 01:18:14,000
... rift between two castes
and two tribes.

1034
01:18:15,700 --> 01:18:17,500
When Gul Khan will go
to Aatish Khan...

1035
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:19,800
... with the marriage proposal,
by then Aatish Khan...

1036
01:18:20,700 --> 01:18:23,700
... must have promised
his sister that...

1037
01:18:24,703 --> 01:18:27,403
... Salma will be married to Dilawar.

1038
01:18:28,900 --> 01:18:31,500
Aatish Khan very well
knows that Gul Khan...

1039
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:34,200
... has murdered his brother-in-law.

1040
01:18:34,700 --> 01:18:37,100
He will never agree
to this proposal.

1041
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:40,400
Congratulation, sister Zainat.
- Come, brother.

1042
01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:41,700
Congratulations.

1043
01:18:42,300 --> 01:18:43,400
Come on...

1044
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:45,000
... have some sweets.

1045
01:18:47,200 --> 01:18:48,500
Chief Angara Khan has...

1046
01:18:48,600 --> 01:18:50,600
... also approved of Dilawar
and Salma's marriage.

1047
01:18:51,300 --> 01:18:52,500
And his blessings are with us.

1048
01:18:52,900 --> 01:18:54,000
Uncle.

1049
01:18:54,100 --> 01:18:55,800
Chief Gul Khan
has sent a message.

1050
01:18:56,100 --> 01:18:57,900
He wants to meet you
alone in the graveyard.

1051
01:18:59,300 --> 01:19:01,300
Gul Khan wants to
meet me alone?

1052
01:19:01,300 --> 01:19:03,300
But i won't let you go alone.

1053
01:19:04,600 --> 01:19:06,100
He had murdered my father...

1054
01:19:06,200 --> 01:19:08,000
... under the excuse
of meeting him alone.

1055
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:13,100
I'll go to graveyard
ith my men. Dilawar.

1056
01:19:28,300 --> 01:19:31,000
Gul Khan!

1057
01:19:33,700 --> 01:19:36,300
You've murdered my father!

1058
01:19:45,700 --> 01:19:48,100
Today i won't let you live!

1059
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:58,400
What are you thinking, Dilawar?

1060
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:03,000
Nothing special, uncle.

1061
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:41,500
Gul Khan.

1062
01:20:42,200 --> 01:20:43,800
This graveyard and these tombs...

1063
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:46,300
... proclaim about human deaths.

1064
01:20:47,200 --> 01:20:49,100
What do you want by
calling me here?

1065
01:20:49,100 --> 01:20:50,300
Aatish Khan...

1066
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:53,500
... the reason for the
enmity between...

1067
01:20:53,500 --> 01:20:55,500
... our tribes is this very land...

1068
01:20:56,500 --> 01:20:59,800
... which is slowly turning
into a graveyard.

1069
01:21:01,200 --> 01:21:02,800
Aatish Khan.

1070
01:21:03,300 --> 01:21:08,000
So many lives have been lost
for thia small piece of land.

1071
01:21:09,300 --> 01:21:10,400
And just see...

1072
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:12,300
... today, this graveyard has...

1073
01:21:12,300 --> 01:21:14,600
... out grown its boundaries
and spreading like a wild fire.

1074
01:21:14,600 --> 01:21:20,000
I don't care if its boundaries
will touch the sky!

1075
01:21:20,200 --> 01:21:23,600
But i want to contain the
boundaries of this graveyard.

1076
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,500
There shouldn't be anymore
blood feud between us.

1077
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,600
So i have come with
a peace proposal. - Peace?

1078
01:21:33,100 --> 01:21:35,500
Between our tribes?

1079
01:21:36,700 --> 01:21:38,100
Gul Khan...

1080
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:41,300
... can there be a peace between
fire and gunpowder?

1081
01:21:42,500 --> 01:21:44,400
Can we ever forget death
of our fore fathers...

1082
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:46,700
... which is a gift from your tribes?

1083
01:21:49,200 --> 01:21:52,200
Gul Khan, as long as
the wind blows...

1084
01:21:52,500 --> 01:21:55,300
... we'll continue to breathe
the fire of our enmity.

1085
01:21:56,200 --> 01:21:57,500
But Aatish Khan...

1086
01:21:58,200 --> 01:22:01,400
... i wish to lay foundation
of peace between our tribes...

1087
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:03,800
... that will be topped by a wall of...

1088
01:22:04,200 --> 01:22:05,800
... love and affection
instead of hatred.

1089
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,093
There is no solution
in the world..

1090
01:22:09,190 --> 01:22:12,717
...which can bring peace
and love between our tribes.

1091
01:22:12,994 --> 01:22:14,962
There is a solution, Aatish Khan.

1092
01:22:16,164 --> 01:22:17,927
Salma and Salim's love.

1093
01:22:23,104 --> 01:22:25,402
Our children should get married.

1094
01:22:25,473 --> 01:22:27,566
Shut up! You cretin!

1095
01:22:28,944 --> 01:22:31,640
How dare you ask my daughter's
hand in marriage?

1096
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:34,139
I swear by the Almighty that..

1097
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:36,500
... if you were't in my area...

1098
01:22:37,100 --> 01:22:39,500
... i would have cut off
your tongue at first.

1099
01:22:39,700 --> 01:22:42,400
And then i would have
severed your head and...

1100
01:22:42,500 --> 01:22:45,200
... buried you right here
in this graveyard!

1101
01:22:45,200 --> 01:22:47,500
Mind your language, Aatish Khan!

1102
01:22:49,400 --> 01:22:51,400
Maybe you don't know that
your daughter Salma...

1103
01:22:51,400 --> 01:22:54,100
... loves my son Salim like a crazy.

1104
01:22:57,400 --> 01:23:00,500
My son Salim is your
daughter's greatest wish.

1105
01:23:00,700 --> 01:23:03,100
He is her dream!

1106
01:23:03,244 --> 01:23:04,336
If this is true..

1107
01:23:05,013 --> 01:23:08,642
...then I'll crush her dream
and destroy her wish!

1108
01:23:09,417 --> 01:23:13,114
But I will never let her
marry your son. Never!

1109
01:23:13,288 --> 01:23:14,983
How will you kill her
love for Salim which..

1110
01:23:15,056 --> 01:23:17,081
...resides in her heart?

1111
01:23:17,258 --> 01:23:18,316
Gul Khan..

1112
01:23:19,327 --> 01:23:22,194
...daughters are married
where her elders tell her to.

1113
01:23:23,400 --> 01:23:26,600
And i have promised my
sister that i'll marry my daughter...

1114
01:23:27,400 --> 01:23:29,100
... to her son, Dilawar.

1115
01:23:32,700 --> 01:23:34,500
And even if i hadn't
promised this...

1116
01:23:35,200 --> 01:23:38,300
I would have never allowed
my daughter to marry your son.

1117
01:23:52,200 --> 01:23:53,400
Father...

1118
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:54,900
... you can't do this.

1119
01:23:55,700 --> 01:23:57,100
How could you make
a decision about...

1120
01:23:57,400 --> 01:23:59,600
... my life without asking me?

1121
01:24:00,400 --> 01:24:03,900
I can't even think about
anyone else besides Salim.

1122
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:05,100
Shut up!

1123
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:08,300
We Pathans never ask...

1124
01:24:08,400 --> 01:24:09,700
... our daufhter's wish...

1125
01:24:10,600 --> 01:24:12,200
... when we want to marry them.

1126
01:24:13,100 --> 01:24:14,500
It's her father who decides this.

1127
01:24:14,700 --> 01:24:18,300
You're trying to shackle
my wish with yours.

1128
01:24:18,500 --> 01:24:19,600
Salma!

1129
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:23,400
You can write Salim's name
on your palm...

1130
01:24:24,300 --> 01:24:26,600
... but can't make him
part of your fate.

1131
01:24:27,300 --> 01:24:28,400
Aunt!

1132
01:24:29,100 --> 01:24:32,000
Erase the name of our
enemy's son from her palm.

1133
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:35,100
And if you can't erase it,
then cut off her hand!

1134
01:24:35,670 --> 01:24:38,503
Father, you'll never able
to get rid of Salim..

1135
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:41,065
...from my heart,
even if you cut off my hand.

1136
01:24:47,182 --> 01:24:50,015
How dare you go against
your own father?!

1137
01:24:50,552 --> 01:24:53,112
Go against Chief Aatish Khan!

1138
01:24:53,488 --> 01:24:56,355
Remember this,
you're getting married to..

1139
01:24:56,591 --> 01:24:59,116
...Dilawar on 15th of this month!

1140
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:05,300
Aunt.
-Yes?

1141
01:25:05,700 --> 01:25:08,200
I am going to town to shop
for the wedding.

1142
01:25:08,600 --> 01:25:10,200
You must tell Salma...

1143
01:25:10,900 --> 01:25:13,500
... that you can't erase
the line made on stone...

1144
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,200
... you can't join the
shattered mirror...

1145
01:25:16,600 --> 01:25:18,600
... same way, even my
decision can't be changed.

1146
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:44,400
Father?
- Salim...

1147
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,200
Aatish Khan has refused
for this alliance.

1148
01:25:49,500 --> 01:25:51,500
He has fixed her marriage with...

1149
01:25:52,300 --> 01:25:53,800
... Dilawar who is his sister's son.

1150
01:25:53,800 --> 01:25:54,900
No, father, no.

1151
01:25:55,500 --> 01:25:56,700
This can't be.

1152
01:25:57,600 --> 01:26:01,700
Salma can let go her life,
but not Salim.

1153
01:26:03,400 --> 01:26:05,400
A calamity can befall
on the earth...

1154
01:26:06,400 --> 01:26:09,600
... but Salma can't get
married to Dilawar.

1155
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:12,500
This is a lie, father.

1156
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,400
A lie.
- For you everything is a lie!

1157
01:26:16,700 --> 01:26:20,000
You've gone crazy in her love.

1158
01:26:21,500 --> 01:26:23,200
Love has made you so blind...

1159
01:26:24,500 --> 01:26:28,600
... that now you say that
your father is lying too.

1160
01:26:30,200 --> 01:26:32,600
I feel sorry for the fact
that i went there...

1161
01:26:33,100 --> 01:26:35,700
... for your love's sake got
humiliated in the end.

1162
01:26:35,900 --> 01:26:38,200
If they have humiliated you,
father...

1163
01:26:38,600 --> 01:26:40,500
... then i will never forgive them.

1164
01:26:41,500 --> 01:26:44,800
But i'll never sacrifice
my love for the enmity.

1165
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:47,700
What will you do?

1166
01:26:49,300 --> 01:26:52,100
Don't lose your sense in
rage and do something...

1167
01:26:52,700 --> 01:26:54,400
... by which death will
become your destiny.

1168
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:56,500
I don't care if i live or die...

1169
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:00,700
... but i won't let Salma become
part of somebody else's life.

1170
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,600
Shabana, the fate has put you...

1171
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:16,400
... into a great test, like me.

1172
01:27:17,200 --> 01:27:21,600
My test is nothing compared
to yours, Salma.

1173
01:27:22,400 --> 01:27:26,500
Along with me,
you're too standing at the...

1174
01:27:26,900 --> 01:27:29,200
... juncture where on the one
hand you've your brother...

1175
01:27:29,300 --> 01:27:31,000
... and on the other hand,
you've your friend.

1176
01:27:32,300 --> 01:27:34,800
If you want then you
can leave me...

1177
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:37,600
... and support your brother.

1178
01:27:38,400 --> 01:27:40,500
I won't feel any
anger towards you...

1179
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:42,200
I won't complain.

1180
01:27:43,300 --> 01:27:46,300
But Shabana, dear...

1181
01:27:46,400 --> 01:27:49,100
... how can i do without you?
- Salma.

1182
01:27:49,500 --> 01:27:53,000
I can give my life
for my happiness.

1183
01:27:53,500 --> 01:27:55,200
Will you do that, Shabana?

1184
01:27:55,800 --> 01:27:58,500
Can you cross the
 boundaries of fear?

1185
01:27:59,100 --> 01:28:01,700
Can you break the
shackles of customs?

1186
01:28:02,500 --> 01:28:04,200
And it doesn't end here,
Shabana...

1187
01:28:04,500 --> 01:28:07,700
... one has to separate from
himself on the path...

1188
01:28:08,300 --> 01:28:10,400
... of friendship as well
as from his dear ones.

1189
01:28:10,500 --> 01:28:14,200
I just know, Salma that
you're my friend...

1190
01:28:14,900 --> 01:28:17,100
... and i can't betray you.

1191
01:28:17,500 --> 01:28:19,500
I am proud of our friendship.

1192
01:28:22,600 --> 01:28:23,600
Shabana...

1193
01:28:24,100 --> 01:28:27,500
...can you arrange Salim
to meet me just for once?

1194
01:28:31,100 --> 01:28:32,100
Yes.

1195
01:28:34,600 --> 01:28:35,700
Shabana...

1196
01:28:36,400 --> 01:28:38,200
Salim hasn't turned up yet.

1197
01:28:39,100 --> 01:28:41,500
Did you tell him to come here,
didn't you?

1198
01:28:41,700 --> 01:28:44,600
Don't get worried,
he will be here.

1199
01:28:46,200 --> 01:28:48,600
Oh dear God, how come brother
Dilawar showed up here?

1200
01:28:48,700 --> 01:28:50,200
Come on, let's hide.

1201
01:28:58,200 --> 01:29:00,900
Dear God, if Salim comes here...

1202
01:29:01,500 --> 01:29:03,100
... then it will be a trouble.

1203
01:29:14,400 --> 01:29:16,600
Oh dear God,
what's going to happen now?

1204
01:29:20,300 --> 01:29:22,100
Why did you venture
into our area?

1205
01:29:22,190 --> 01:29:23,348
I am here to meet Salma.

1206
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:35,700
What did you say? Say it again!

1207
01:29:36,200 --> 01:29:38,000
I am here to meet my Salma.

1208
01:29:40,100 --> 01:29:41,500
Salim!
- No, Salma.

1209
01:29:41,700 --> 01:29:43,500
I'll erase her existence from...

1210
01:29:43,900 --> 01:29:47,200
... your heart and soul so that
you won't even utter her name.

1211
01:29:48,100 --> 01:29:49,200
Dear God!

1212
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:38,900
Stop it.

1213
01:30:40,100 --> 01:30:42,500
I say, stop it!

1214
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:45,800
Sir, tell him that...

1215
01:30:46,700 --> 01:30:49,100
... Salma is my wife.

1216
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:53,200
She is getting married to me
15th of this month.

1217
01:30:54,300 --> 01:30:55,500
After today...

1218
01:30:56,500 --> 01:31:00,100
... even if i see his shadow
on our land...

1219
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,000
... then i'll bury him right there.

1220
01:31:03,100 --> 01:31:04,600
Even then...

1221
01:31:04,700 --> 01:31:08,200
... you can't take my place
in Salma's heart.

1222
01:31:08,200 --> 01:31:10,500
What did you say?
- Dilawar, no!

1223
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,700
Go back to your own areas.

1224
01:31:32,100 --> 01:31:34,700
Shabana, Salim has left.

1225
01:31:35,200 --> 01:31:36,400
What will happen now?

1226
01:31:36,600 --> 01:31:39,300
Let's wait for a while,
maybe he'll come back.

1227
01:32:01,200 --> 01:32:04,300
Jabbar is ready to die
for you, Meer Salim.

1228
01:32:04,600 --> 01:32:08,100
Meet me on the outskirt
of my village at midnight.

1229
01:32:08,300 --> 01:32:09,600
I will see you there.

1230
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:13,000
Thanks.

1231
01:32:13,300 --> 01:32:14,400
Aunt...

1232
01:32:15,100 --> 01:32:17,600
... you can prove your loyalty.

1233
01:32:18,400 --> 01:32:22,400
You can strangle me,
if try to step out the house.

1234
01:32:22,700 --> 01:32:23,800
No, dear, no.

1235
01:32:26,173 --> 01:32:30,974
I support your love, dear.

1236
01:32:32,113 --> 01:32:34,581
Aunt, come with me.

1237
01:32:34,749 --> 01:32:37,217
How can I do that?

1238
01:32:37,700 --> 01:32:39,700
Everyone will suspect you, aunt.

1239
01:32:40,200 --> 01:32:42,600
They won't let you live.

1240
01:32:43,400 --> 01:32:45,700
Dear, i won't even flinch...

1241
01:32:46,400 --> 01:32:48,700
... to sacrifice myself for
your happiness.

1242
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:52,100
Chief will come back
by tomorrow...

1243
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,100
... afternoon with your
wedding items.

1244
01:32:55,400 --> 01:32:57,600
And if they don't find me
in the mansion...

1245
01:32:57,700 --> 01:33:00,500
... everyone will know that
you're missing too.

1246
01:33:00,500 --> 01:33:02,400
Then promise me something.

1247
01:33:02,900 --> 01:33:06,000
It will be a mother's promise
to her daughter. - What?

1248
01:33:06,700 --> 01:33:08,200
By tomorrow afternoon...

1249
01:33:08,300 --> 01:33:10,400
... before father comes...

1250
01:33:11,200 --> 01:33:13,700
... you'll declare that
i have gone missing.

1251
01:33:14,100 --> 01:33:17,400
What?
- Then no one will blame you.

1252
01:33:18,300 --> 01:33:22,000
By then we will be out
of reach of everybody.

1253
01:33:23,500 --> 01:33:24,700
Okay, dear. Come.

1254
01:33:27,100 --> 01:33:28,300
Hide here.

1255
01:33:29,400 --> 01:33:30,500
Guard.

1256
01:33:32,700 --> 01:33:34,700
Guard!
- Yes, madam?

1257
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,300
I can hear some voices in
the back of our mansion.

1258
01:33:37,400 --> 01:33:39,300
Why don't you go and check?
- Sure.

1259
01:33:42,300 --> 01:33:43,400
Salma, dear.

1260
01:33:48,200 --> 01:33:49,600
Forgive me, mother.

1261
01:33:50,600 --> 01:33:54,400
You call me mother,
and yet you apologize to me?

1262
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,500
May God sanctify your love!

1263
01:34:02,200 --> 01:34:03,400
Oh darling.

1264
01:34:31,100 --> 01:34:32,100
"The love!"

1265
01:34:33,600 --> 01:34:34,600
"The love!"

1266
01:34:36,200 --> 01:34:41,300
"The love is like henna,
that when you crush it."

1267
01:34:41,500 --> 01:34:46,600
"The love is like henna,
that when you crush it."

1268
01:34:46,700 --> 01:34:50,700
"The world will keep gaping."

1269
01:34:52,100 --> 01:34:55,200
"The world will keep gaping...

1270
01:34:55,400 --> 01:34:57,600
... and it'll become
even more vibrant."

1271
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,700
"It will become even more vibrant.
- The love!"

1272
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:07,500
"The love is like henna,
that if you crush it."

1273
01:35:07,600 --> 01:35:11,700
"The world will keep gaping."

1274
01:35:13,100 --> 01:35:16,200
"The world will keep gaping...

1275
01:35:16,400 --> 01:35:18,800
... and it'll become
even more vibrant."

1276
01:35:19,100 --> 01:35:21,700
"It will become even more vibrant.
- The love!"

1277
01:35:23,500 --> 01:35:29,200
"The love is like henna,
that if you crush it."

1278
01:35:44,500 --> 01:35:50,400
"Love brings you closer to God."

1279
01:35:55,100 --> 01:36:00,200
"Love brings you closer to God."

1280
01:36:00,300 --> 01:36:05,900
"It makes you forget the world."

1281
01:36:08,200 --> 01:36:11,400
"It will never...

1282
01:36:13,300 --> 01:36:18,400
"It will never bow down
before this mighty world."

1283
01:36:18,600 --> 01:36:21,100
"It will never bow down."

1284
01:36:21,200 --> 01:36:22,400
"The love!"

1285
01:36:23,900 --> 01:36:29,000
"The love is like henna,
that if you crush it."

1286
01:36:29,200 --> 01:36:32,300
"The world will keep gaping...

1287
01:36:32,500 --> 01:36:34,600
... it'll become even more vibrant."

1288
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:39,500
Come.

1289
01:36:40,500 --> 01:36:41,600
Greetings.

1290
01:36:41,700 --> 01:36:43,400
My respects.
- Same to you.

1291
01:36:45,400 --> 01:36:47,200
Come, Salma.
- Meer Salim...

1292
01:36:47,334 --> 01:36:48,426
...come inside.

1293
01:36:50,971 --> 01:36:52,029
Aunt!

1294
01:36:53,240 --> 01:36:54,298
Aunt!

1295
01:36:57,144 --> 01:37:00,511
See, I've almost bought entire
town for Salma's wedding.

1296
01:37:01,300 --> 01:37:03,600
Call Salma and tell her...

1297
01:37:03,900 --> 01:37:06,100
... that i love her more than my life.

1298
01:37:07,600 --> 01:37:09,600
See, aunt, take a look.

1299
01:37:21,200 --> 01:37:25,700
These jewellery and clothes
mean a father's dream and wish.

1300
01:37:26,700 --> 01:37:29,600
I'll make her wedding
a grand event.

1301
01:37:30,300 --> 01:37:32,000
Call her. Call Salma.

1302
01:37:33,300 --> 01:37:36,100
Why are you staring at me?

1303
01:37:36,500 --> 01:37:38,400
Come on, go on. Call her.

1304
01:37:38,600 --> 01:37:40,600
Salma is not in the mansion, sire.

1305
01:37:43,600 --> 01:37:45,100
She is not in the mansion?

1306
01:37:46,300 --> 01:37:48,400
Then where is she?
- I don't know, sire.

1307
01:37:48,500 --> 01:37:49,600
You don't know?

1308
01:37:50,400 --> 01:37:51,700
Where did she go?

1309
01:37:52,300 --> 01:37:53,600
And when did she go?

1310
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,700
In the morning, i woke
up and realized.

1311
01:37:57,600 --> 01:38:00,300
I searched her everywhere
in the mansion.

1312
01:38:01,400 --> 01:38:04,400
But i couldn't find her.
- Did you ask the servants?

1313
01:38:04,600 --> 01:38:06,300
And the guards?

1314
01:38:06,500 --> 01:38:09,400
How could i ask them?

1315
01:38:10,600 --> 01:38:13,500
It's matter of your family prestige.
- No!

1316
01:38:13,700 --> 01:38:15,200
It won't happen.

1317
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,100
A daughter cannot discard
her father's love...

1318
01:38:18,300 --> 01:38:20,700
... and disgrace her father like that.

1319
01:38:22,500 --> 01:38:25,200
Salma, how can you
be so ignorant?

1320
01:38:25,500 --> 01:38:27,200
How can you be so ignorant?

1321
01:38:27,500 --> 01:38:31,500
Yoy became my own enemy
by fraternizing with them?

1322
01:38:33,900 --> 01:38:37,200
I am going to destroy their world.

1323
01:38:38,300 --> 01:38:40,700
I'm going to take away their lives...

1324
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,300
... who took away my daughter.

1325
01:38:43,500 --> 01:38:45,500
I'm going to take away their lives!

1326
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:12,700
Dilawar!
- Uncle!

1327
01:39:14,500 --> 01:39:16,500
You won't go anywhere, uncle.

1328
01:39:17,100 --> 01:39:18,500
Just be at home.

1329
01:39:19,600 --> 01:39:22,000
I am going to fulfill your wish.

1330
01:39:23,400 --> 01:39:26,000
I am going to destroy
our enemies.

1331
01:39:26,100 --> 01:39:28,200
Sire, there is news that
Meer Salim has...

1332
01:39:28,300 --> 01:39:31,500
... abducted Chief Aatish
Khan's daughter.

1333
01:39:34,600 --> 01:39:35,700
Salim?

1334
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:39,500
How could you do this? Father,
Salma and Salim have run away.

1335
01:39:39,600 --> 01:39:40,700
Good news.

1336
01:39:41,600 --> 01:39:44,300
Good news. You've given me
good news for the first time.

1337
01:39:52,200 --> 01:39:54,200
Mr. Dilawar, you're here?

1338
01:39:54,200 --> 01:39:56,400
I want to search your house...

1339
01:39:57,100 --> 01:39:58,600
... and you know the reason.

1340
01:39:59,200 --> 01:40:00,300
I have no idea.

1341
01:40:01,600 --> 01:40:04,400
Mr. Dilawar,
you don't hail from my tribe...

1342
01:40:05,200 --> 01:40:07,100
... but still i respect you.

1343
01:40:07,600 --> 01:40:09,300
This is a poor man's house...

1344
01:40:09,500 --> 01:40:11,400
... and not some mansion...

1345
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,600
... that you need so many
men to search it.

1346
01:40:16,900 --> 01:40:18,100
My wife is inside.

1347
01:40:18,900 --> 01:40:21,400
You can search if you want to.

1348
01:40:22,500 --> 01:40:23,500
But....

1349
01:41:16,600 --> 01:41:18,400
Why didn't you ask me...

1350
01:41:19,400 --> 01:41:21,000
... whom am i looking for?

1351
01:41:21,200 --> 01:41:24,500
Didn't i say earlier that
i respect you?

1352
01:41:25,400 --> 01:41:29,100
I don't question people
whom we respect.

1353
01:41:40,100 --> 01:41:42,000
Thank a million to Almighty...

1354
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,400
... that you thought of hiding
them in the jungle.

1355
01:41:44,400 --> 01:41:46,100
Or else it would have
been a calamity.

1356
01:41:46,100 --> 01:41:48,000
Almighty is to be thanked for sure.

1357
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:51,200
But Ruksaar, hurry up,
it's going to be dark now.

1358
01:41:51,600 --> 01:41:54,200
And i have to go and
give them food. - Alright.

1359
01:41:54,300 --> 01:41:56,600
Come on, close your eyes
and think that...

1360
01:41:57,300 --> 01:41:59,100
... i have come with
the bandwagon.

1361
01:41:59,400 --> 01:42:02,600
You've adorned like a bride
and your friends...

1362
01:42:03,200 --> 01:42:05,100
... well, they are teasing us. Huh?

1363
01:42:05,600 --> 01:42:07,000
Smile now.

1364
01:42:07,300 --> 01:42:08,600
Come on, smile.

1365
01:42:11,400 --> 01:42:14,500
Close your eyes and drift off
to your dreamland.

1366
01:42:28,700 --> 01:42:30,700
"I have got."

1367
01:42:30,700 --> 01:42:35,200
"Yes, i have got henna
on my feet."

1368
01:42:35,500 --> 01:42:39,500
"She has got henna on her feet."

1369
01:42:40,100 --> 01:42:43,800
"Ask my hubby to wait."

1370
01:42:46,800 --> 01:42:51,100
"I'll take time to get
into palanquin."

1371
01:42:51,300 --> 01:42:55,300
"She'll take time to get
into palanquin."

1372
01:42:55,800 --> 01:42:59,600
"Ask my hubby to wait."

1373
01:43:00,100 --> 01:43:04,300
"The groom is eager
to meet his bride."

1374
01:43:04,700 --> 01:43:08,700
"The groom is eager
to meet his bride."

1375
01:43:09,300 --> 01:43:13,400
"Tell her to show herself fast."

1376
01:43:13,900 --> 01:43:17,800
"Today is our first night."

1377
01:43:18,400 --> 01:43:22,400
"Today is our first night."

1378
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:26,600
"Tell her to show herself fast."

1379
01:43:27,400 --> 01:43:31,500
"I have got henna on my feet."

1380
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:36,300
"Ask my hubby to wait."

1381
01:43:54,428 --> 01:43:58,624
The gardener has
gone to garden.

1382
01:43:59,132 --> 01:44:03,225
She will get the jasmine buds.

1383
01:44:03,337 --> 01:44:07,498
She will get the jasmine buds.

1384
01:44:08,100 --> 01:44:12,200
"Then my friends with
their delicate fingers...

1385
01:44:12,500 --> 01:44:16,800
... will make garlands of them."

1386
01:44:17,100 --> 01:44:21,400
"We all will make
garlands of them."

1387
01:44:23,900 --> 01:44:28,100
"It will take time to
make the garlands."

1388
01:44:28,400 --> 01:44:32,200
"It take time to make
the garlands."

1389
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:37,000
"Ask my hubby to wait."

1390
01:44:37,400 --> 01:44:41,400
"The groom is eager
to meet his bride."

1391
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:45,700
"Tell her to show herself fast."

1392
01:44:46,400 --> 01:44:50,500
"I have got henna on my feet."

1393
01:44:51,100 --> 01:44:55,100
"Ask my hubby to wait."

1394
01:45:09,100 --> 01:45:13,200
"I've just lit the lamp...

1395
01:45:13,400 --> 01:45:17,600
... it will take a while to make kohl."

1396
01:45:18,100 --> 01:45:22,300
It will take a while to make kohl."

1397
01:45:22,500 --> 01:45:26,500
"I haven't worn my jewellery yet...

1398
01:45:27,100 --> 01:45:31,300
... i'll take time to go ready."

1399
01:45:31,600 --> 01:45:35,600
"She'll take time to go get ready."

1400
01:45:38,300 --> 01:45:42,400
"I've still not worn my anklets."

1401
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:47,000
"Yes, she hasn't worn
her anklets."

1402
01:45:47,400 --> 01:45:51,400
"Ask my hubby to wait."

1403
01:45:51,500 --> 01:45:56,000
"The groom is eager
to meet his bride."

1404
01:45:56,400 --> 01:46:00,600
"Tell her to show herself fast."

1405
01:46:00,700 --> 01:46:05,100
"I have got henna on my feet."

1406
01:46:05,400 --> 01:46:09,400
"Ask my hubby to wait."

1407
01:46:24,300 --> 01:46:32,700
"Mother won't stop crying."

1408
01:46:34,100 --> 01:46:43,600
"Mother won't stop crying."

1409
01:46:44,700 --> 01:46:54,500
"I still have to comfort my father."

1410
01:46:56,100 --> 01:47:04,400
"Even my friends are crying."

1411
01:47:05,400 --> 01:47:13,100
"I still have to soothe them too."

1412
01:47:17,600 --> 01:47:22,000
"Adorn the palanquin
and keep it ready."

1413
01:47:22,200 --> 01:47:26,400
"Adorn the palanquin
and keep it ready."

1414
01:47:26,600 --> 01:47:31,000
"It's about time, she will come."

1415
01:47:35,700 --> 01:47:39,800
"We are waiting for you a while."

1416
01:47:40,300 --> 01:47:44,000
"We are waiting for you a while."

1417
01:47:44,500 --> 01:47:48,800
"And now, my beloved
is going to come."

1418
01:47:49,300 --> 01:47:53,300
"Today, i am leaving my father...

1419
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:58,000
"Today, i am leaving my father...

1420
01:47:58,300 --> 01:48:02,300
... and coming to you, my beloved."

1421
01:48:02,900 --> 01:48:06,900
"Today, i am leaving my father...

1422
01:48:07,300 --> 01:48:11,400
... and coming to you, my beloved."

1423
01:48:11,900 --> 01:48:15,700
"Today, i am leaving my father...

1424
01:48:16,400 --> 01:48:20,200
... and coming to you, my beloved."

1425
01:48:20,900 --> 01:48:25,000
"Today, i am leaving my father...

1426
01:48:25,400 --> 01:48:29,100
... and coming to you, my beloved."

1427
01:48:29,900 --> 01:48:33,700
"Today, i am leaving my father...

1428
01:48:34,400 --> 01:48:38,300
... and coming to you, my beloved."

1429
01:48:40,400 --> 01:48:41,600
Meer Salim...

1430
01:48:42,100 --> 01:48:45,100
... Dilawar dropped by at my place
while looking for you two.

1431
01:48:45,300 --> 01:48:47,500
I saw murderous rage
in his eyes.

1432
01:48:48,300 --> 01:48:51,000
I have come here with
lot of difficulty.

1433
01:48:52,200 --> 01:48:55,800
It'll be better if you go
to Mr. Shah's place.

1434
01:48:56,600 --> 01:48:57,700
No, no...

1435
01:48:58,100 --> 01:49:01,600
... we won't put decent man
like him in trouble.

1436
01:49:02,400 --> 01:49:04,400
Brother Jabbar is right.

1437
01:49:04,500 --> 01:49:08,300
We might secure justice
if we take Mr. Shah's refuge.

1438
01:49:09,500 --> 01:49:11,100
You're lying!

1439
01:49:11,400 --> 01:49:14,000
I know that you're aware
of Salma's where abouts.

1440
01:49:14,100 --> 01:49:15,600
I don't know anything, chief.

1441
01:49:15,900 --> 01:49:18,800
You're her secret keeper,
and you're hiding her.

1442
01:49:19,600 --> 01:49:22,000
I have got nothing to hide.

1443
01:49:22,300 --> 01:49:24,500
Don't you forget that
you're my servant!

1444
01:49:25,100 --> 01:49:28,300
You have instigated the
daughter of your master...

1445
01:49:28,500 --> 01:49:31,300
... and the chief of the tribe,
to elope with a stranger.

1446
01:49:31,700 --> 01:49:34,000
Do you know the
punishment for this?

1447
01:49:34,200 --> 01:49:37,100
The tribesmen can
stone you to death.

1448
01:49:37,300 --> 01:49:39,500
You are already doing it, sire.

1449
01:49:40,400 --> 01:49:42,500
I didn't give birth to Salma...

1450
01:49:43,300 --> 01:49:47,300
... but i can embrace death for her.

1451
01:49:48,148 --> 01:49:51,982
You can punish me
for Salma's mistake.

1452
01:49:52,118 --> 01:49:55,417
If your husband hadn't taken..

1453
01:49:56,089 --> 01:49:58,250
...the bullet on his chest
to save my life..

1454
01:49:58,591 --> 01:50:00,058
...then I swear by God..

1455
01:50:00,126 --> 01:50:03,024
...I would have strangled
you with my bare hands.

1456
01:50:03,229 --> 01:50:06,298
You've been disloyal to us.
- No, sire..

1457
01:50:07,300 --> 01:50:09,200
... i haven't been disloyal to you.

1458
01:50:10,400 --> 01:50:13,300
Salma was my responsibility
given by you.

1459
01:50:14,200 --> 01:50:19,000
But Salma was also your
responsibility given by her mother.

1460
01:50:19,900 --> 01:50:22,400
If she would have been
alive today...

1461
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:26,500
... then nothing would have
gone against Salma.

1462
01:50:26,600 --> 01:50:29,700
Nothing would have gone
against Salma, sire.

1463
01:50:29,900 --> 01:50:31,700
Nothing would have
gone against Salma.

1464
01:50:32,500 --> 01:50:36,000
You know that i didn't marry
for the second time for Salma.

1465
01:50:36,700 --> 01:50:39,000
Because i feared that
the step mother...

1466
01:50:39,200 --> 01:50:41,600
... won't love her like her
own mother.

1467
01:50:42,400 --> 01:50:45,600
I have spent all my life
like a recluse.

1468
01:50:46,900 --> 01:50:50,200
So can't i expect from her,
that for me...

1469
01:50:50,400 --> 01:50:53,900
... for her father for the chief
of her tribe...

1470
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,000
... she should sacrifice her love?

1471
01:51:02,100 --> 01:51:04,200
Shabana, tell me the truth.
Where are they hidden?

1472
01:51:04,200 --> 01:51:06,200
Didn't you hear me?
- I have no idea.

1473
01:51:06,500 --> 01:51:09,900
You are lying. You would stay
with her all the time.

1474
01:51:10,100 --> 01:51:12,500
You're his secret keeper.
You know everything.

1475
01:51:13,600 --> 01:51:15,600
Shabana,
you have seen my love...

1476
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:17,700
... but you haven't seen my anger.

1477
01:51:17,900 --> 01:51:19,900
If you don't consider
me your brother...

1478
01:51:19,900 --> 01:51:22,400
... then i won't consider you
my sister. - Tell us, Shabana.

1479
01:51:22,400 --> 01:51:25,200
If you know anything, then tell us.
- I've no idea, mother.

1480
01:51:25,400 --> 01:51:27,300
If i had known anything,
i would have told you.

1481
01:51:27,300 --> 01:51:28,500
She is lying, mother.

1482
01:51:28,500 --> 01:51:30,100
It shows on her face
that she is lying.

1483
01:51:30,100 --> 01:51:32,200
If you read faces so well...

1484
01:51:32,300 --> 01:51:34,200
... then you could have read the
truth that was on Salma's face.

1485
01:51:34,300 --> 01:51:36,000
Shut up, don't be arrogant.

1486
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:37,500
How dare you answer back
to your elder brother?

1487
01:51:37,500 --> 01:51:39,900
When i keep quiet,
you ask me to talk.

1488
01:51:40,300 --> 01:51:42,300
When i talk, you ask me
to keep quiet?

1489
01:52:01,500 --> 01:52:05,000
Greetings, Mr. Shah.
- Same to you.

1490
01:52:08,300 --> 01:52:10,800
We would like to come
in your refuge, sir.

1491
01:52:11,500 --> 01:52:13,600
We might get life in your refuge.

1492
01:52:15,100 --> 01:52:16,600
Come with me.

1493
01:52:27,200 --> 01:52:28,700
Dilawar, you're here?

1494
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:32,300
I'm here to hunt my prey, sir.
- This is a pious place...

1495
01:52:33,200 --> 01:52:34,700
... and not some hunting ground.

1496
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:36,700
I've always come to the place...

1497
01:52:37,700 --> 01:52:39,500
... where prey is bound
to be found.

1498
01:52:40,500 --> 01:52:43,100
Dilawar.
- My prey's foot steps...

1499
01:52:44,200 --> 01:52:49,000
... have led me to your place.
- There is no lock on my doors.

1500
01:52:49,600 --> 01:52:51,400
Every door is open.

1501
01:52:52,100 --> 01:52:53,300
Dear God!

1502
01:53:01,500 --> 01:53:02,600
Mr. Shah...

1503
01:53:04,100 --> 01:53:05,600
... i respect you a lot.

1504
01:53:07,400 --> 01:53:09,400
And i want to tell you something.

1505
01:53:11,100 --> 01:53:12,600
If Salma can't belong to me...

1506
01:53:13,700 --> 01:53:15,700
... then she won't belong
to anyone else.

1507
01:53:27,900 --> 01:53:30,700
Uncle, i had been to
Mr. Shah's place.

1508
01:53:32,300 --> 01:53:35,000
I didn't search his place
out of respect for him.

1509
01:53:35,600 --> 01:53:37,500
But i am sure that both of them...

1510
01:53:38,100 --> 01:53:40,100
... have taken a refuge
with Mr. Shah.

1511
01:53:55,400 --> 01:53:56,800
Greetings, Mr. Shah.

1512
01:53:58,200 --> 01:54:01,000
Father.
- Same to you.

1513
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:03,000
I have a news that my daughter...

1514
01:54:03,400 --> 01:54:06,300
... and Gul Khan's son has
taken refuge with you.

1515
01:54:07,400 --> 01:54:09,100
Salim is a culprit!

1516
01:54:09,200 --> 01:54:13,100
He has committed a grave
crime by abducting my daughter!

1517
01:54:15,982 --> 01:54:19,179
Daughters lose their
existence for their fathers..

1518
01:54:20,153 --> 01:54:21,916
...once they cross their limits.

1519
01:54:22,622 --> 01:54:25,090
And when your own daughter
betrays you..

1520
01:54:25,224 --> 01:54:27,249
...then how can I behave
like a father?

1521
01:54:27,727 --> 01:54:30,093
My eyes are raging
with hatred, Mr. Shah.

1522
01:54:31,397 --> 01:54:35,197
I'll destroy those
who have dishonoured me.

1523
01:54:36,035 --> 01:54:37,502
I am going to kill them.

1524
01:54:40,239 --> 01:54:44,733
If you think that death is a
solution for both of them..

1525
01:54:45,511 --> 01:54:47,376
...then they both are inside.

1526
01:54:48,247 --> 01:54:52,206
But before reaching to them,
you'll have to kill me.

1527
01:54:59,600 --> 01:55:00,700
Okay, Mr. Shah.

1528
01:55:01,500 --> 01:55:03,700
If you won't let me
take a decision...

1529
01:55:04,400 --> 01:55:08,000
... then i'll have to turn to
senior chief Angara.

1530
01:55:27,400 --> 01:55:30,600
Don't try to scare me with
your blazing eyes, Aatish Khan.

1531
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:34,700
Even i am enraged with hatred!

1532
01:55:34,900 --> 01:55:37,000
Not only blazing eyes boy...

1533
01:55:37,600 --> 01:55:39,300
... but pretty soon it will be...

1534
01:55:39,400 --> 01:55:41,600
... your son's body which
will be blazing.

1535
01:55:42,500 --> 01:55:45,400
Your son has applied henna
on my daughter's hand.

1536
01:55:45,700 --> 01:55:48,700
And now i will smear your
chest with his blood.

1537
01:55:48,800 --> 01:55:52,500
If you'll fire even one bullet,
Aatish Khan...

1538
01:55:53,500 --> 01:55:55,800
... millions of bullets will
destroy not only your family...

1539
01:55:55,900 --> 01:55:57,700
... but also your entire tribe.

1540
01:55:57,800 --> 01:55:59,800
May God forgive me!

1541
01:56:02,100 --> 01:56:05,000
This is not a battle ground,
fellows...

1542
01:56:06,400 --> 01:56:08,400
... but a justice court.

1543
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:12,400
Let by gones be by gones.

1544
01:56:13,500 --> 01:56:18,100
Now i must make a decision
like a visionary.

1545
01:56:18,200 --> 01:56:20,600
Now only bullets can make
any decision, sire!

1546
01:56:20,900 --> 01:56:23,400
Have patience, chief Aatish Khan.

1547
01:56:23,500 --> 01:56:25,200
Have patience.

1548
01:56:25,600 --> 01:56:27,500
Greetings, everyone.

1549
01:56:27,500 --> 01:56:29,500
Same to you.

1550
01:56:31,700 --> 01:56:33,100
Fellows...

1551
01:56:34,100 --> 01:56:37,500
... if guns could make
any decisions then...

1552
01:56:38,400 --> 01:56:42,000
... there wouldn't have been
any humans left in this world.

1553
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:45,600
This world would have
ended long back.

1554
01:56:46,700 --> 01:56:51,400
There wouldn't have been
courts or judges or...

1555
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:55,100
Or else we wouldn't have
been here together.

1556
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:58,200
Today not guns or swords...

1557
01:56:59,500 --> 01:57:03,000
... but the human values
will make the decision.

1558
01:57:03,400 --> 01:57:05,200
You people will do it.

1559
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:13,500
Chief Gul Khan,
Chief Aatish Khan...

1560
01:57:14,300 --> 01:57:15,500
... have a seat.

1561
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,300
Mr. Shah, have a seat.

1562
01:57:30,300 --> 01:57:33,300
This matter is about the way in...

1563
01:57:34,200 --> 01:57:36,700
... which the new relations
were formed or the old...

1564
01:57:36,700 --> 01:57:38,300
... this were severed.

1565
01:57:39,100 --> 01:57:41,400
The elders of tribe
have to decide...

1566
01:57:42,300 --> 01:57:45,600
... that if they can approve
of this way...

1567
01:57:46,400 --> 01:57:48,600
... or not. If they approve of it....

1568
01:57:49,100 --> 01:57:51,300
... then elders respect
will be destroyed.

1569
01:57:51,500 --> 01:57:53,500
It will be a disgrace for decency!

1570
01:57:53,600 --> 01:57:56,000
It will be end to an age
old custom and...

1571
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:58,400
... our heads will hang in shame.

1572
01:57:58,500 --> 01:58:00,400
If we approve of this relation...

1573
01:58:00,700 --> 01:58:04,200
... then it will be a bad and
a dangerous example.

1574
01:58:05,200 --> 01:58:07,700
Shame lessness and
disobedience will be on rise.

1575
01:58:08,100 --> 01:58:10,100
No one's honour
will remain intact.

1576
01:58:10,300 --> 01:58:11,500
Any man...

1577
01:58:11,600 --> 01:58:15,000
... can abduct anyone's daughter,
wife or daughter-in-law!

1578
01:58:15,300 --> 01:58:16,700
Anyone's fiancee...

1579
01:58:16,900 --> 01:58:20,600
... will run away in the
dark of the night...

1580
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:22,500
... and get married to him!

1581
01:58:25,600 --> 01:58:28,300
May God forgive me!

1582
01:58:30,200 --> 01:58:33,000
She won't even wait for the night.

1583
01:58:34,100 --> 01:58:36,100
Hostility will rise...

1584
01:58:36,600 --> 01:58:39,200
... there will be blood bath
and fights.

1585
01:58:39,600 --> 01:58:41,700
It will be blood shed.

1586
01:58:47,500 --> 01:58:49,100
Salma and Salim...

1587
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:52,200
... they are culprit in my eyes!

1588
01:58:53,100 --> 01:58:54,600
And i ask you, my brothers...

1589
01:58:54,900 --> 01:58:56,500
... they should be punished
in such a way...

1590
01:58:56,500 --> 01:58:59,300
... that, it should be become
an exemplary!

1591
01:59:13,600 --> 01:59:15,500
Chief is absolutely right.

1592
01:59:15,600 --> 01:59:19,400
Salma and Salim should be
stoned to death in front of everyone.

1593
01:59:19,600 --> 01:59:22,300
They should be burried
alive in the wall!

1594
01:59:22,600 --> 01:59:26,100
If we forgive their mistake
then our tribes will be destroyed.

1595
01:59:26,300 --> 01:59:29,100
They should be punished
severely, they are culprits.

1596
01:59:29,700 --> 01:59:31,200
Yes, they are culprits.

1597
01:59:32,400 --> 01:59:33,500
People...

1598
01:59:35,200 --> 01:59:38,300
... Salim and Salma are
culprits for sure.

1599
01:59:39,300 --> 01:59:41,900
Because they are
born in family which....

1600
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:44,300
... consider each other
mortal enemy.

1601
01:59:46,700 --> 01:59:48,700
And i think nature it self is culprit...

1602
01:59:49,600 --> 01:59:53,100
... which granted them with
geelings and minds....

1603
01:59:53,700 --> 01:59:57,600
... which made them crazy
about each other...

1604
01:59:58,300 --> 02:00:00,600
... and made them
forget their enmity.

1605
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:04,000
Because both of them
are made for each other.

1606
02:00:05,300 --> 02:00:11,600
Birds of different kinds
don't fly together...

1607
02:00:13,700 --> 02:00:17,500
... Salim and Salma have fulfilled...

1608
02:00:18,100 --> 02:00:20,200
... the nature's need
to stay together.

1609
02:00:20,700 --> 02:00:23,300
Their love is beyond compare.

1610
02:00:25,900 --> 02:00:27,300
Love is peace...

1611
02:00:28,300 --> 02:00:31,500
... happiness and life.

1612
02:00:32,500 --> 02:00:36,300
And hatred is war,
destruction and death.

1613
02:00:40,400 --> 02:00:44,100
They have made the mistake
to run from their house.

1614
02:00:45,100 --> 02:00:46,800
But it's not a sin...

1615
02:00:48,100 --> 02:00:51,000
... which demands us to
stone them to death.

1616
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:54,300
That they should be burried
alive in the wall.

1617
02:00:55,100 --> 02:00:57,700
That their love should
be destroyed.

1618
02:00:58,500 --> 02:01:01,400
They could have left their region...

1619
02:01:01,400 --> 02:01:03,700
... and gone to some else place.

1620
02:01:04,500 --> 02:01:05,600
But i...

1621
02:01:06,800 --> 02:01:09,000
... i myself have brought
them here...

1622
02:01:09,400 --> 02:01:12,100
... right before their own tribes.

1623
02:01:12,500 --> 02:01:16,700
Before their own people,
so that rhey will get justice.

1624
02:01:17,937 --> 02:01:21,529
If we wish to turn this
land into heaven..

1625
02:01:22,575 --> 02:01:26,668
...then both of them have
planted their love here.

1626
02:01:27,913 --> 02:01:30,538
If we wanted to end hostilities..

1627
02:01:31,484 --> 02:01:34,610
...then they have already broken
up boundaries of enmity..

1628
02:01:35,287 --> 02:01:37,685
...and laid foundation
for the peace.

1629
02:01:40,100 --> 02:01:43,500
If we wish to journey towards
the light from the darkness....

1630
02:01:44,700 --> 02:01:47,900
... then they have
lightened the first lamp.

1631
02:01:59,700 --> 02:02:02,600
Instead of uprooting that sapling...

1632
02:02:03,600 --> 02:02:05,900
... destroying the foundation...

1633
02:02:06,900 --> 02:02:09,500
... and putting off that lamp...

1634
02:02:10,300 --> 02:02:14,200
... we should walk on the shining
path along with them.

1635
02:02:16,500 --> 02:02:19,000
Because it's not only
their destination...

1636
02:02:19,400 --> 02:02:21,300
... but it's our destination too.

1637
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:24,500
It's destination that belongs
to our coming generation.

1638
02:02:25,700 --> 02:02:27,200
But remember...

1639
02:02:28,300 --> 02:02:31,200
... if you make any wrong decision...

1640
02:02:32,300 --> 02:02:35,300
... then it's going to
destroy and ruin us.

1641
02:02:36,600 --> 02:02:38,800
And your one right decision...

1642
02:02:39,600 --> 02:02:42,200
... could bring peace, love...

1643
02:02:43,100 --> 02:02:47,400
... and harmony to this
atmosphere filled with hatred.

1644
02:02:51,200 --> 02:02:55,600
Today is the time, the heaven...

1645
02:02:56,500 --> 02:03:00,800
... the earth and the our coming...

1646
02:03:01,900 --> 02:03:05,100
... generations will bear
your decision.

1647
02:03:50,100 --> 02:03:51,200
People...

1648
02:03:52,200 --> 02:03:53,800
... the entire tribesman...

1649
02:03:54,500 --> 02:03:57,000
... agrees with Mr. Shah's opinion.

1650
02:03:58,400 --> 02:04:01,500
And we accept Salma and Salim...

1651
02:04:02,200 --> 02:04:04,600
... to be wife and husband.

1652
02:04:04,900 --> 02:04:07,200
Amen!
- Amen!

1653
02:04:12,400 --> 02:04:15,500
I respect the decision taken
by our elder members.

1654
02:04:17,100 --> 02:04:18,700
I command both...

1655
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:23,300
... the chiefs to accept
this decision.

1656
02:04:28,400 --> 02:04:30,000
Chief Aatish Khan.

1657
02:04:31,400 --> 02:04:32,600
Chief Gul Khan.

1658
02:04:45,700 --> 02:04:49,600
Now, you both come to my
place and meet your children.

1659
02:04:50,500 --> 02:04:53,500
And break this good
news to them.

1660
02:04:57,600 --> 02:05:00,200
Gul Khan.
- Aatish Khan.

1661
02:05:13,100 --> 02:05:14,200
Salim!

1662
02:05:16,200 --> 02:05:18,300
Salim! Run!

1663
02:05:34,500 --> 02:05:36,000
No!

1664
02:05:37,200 --> 02:05:38,500
No!

1665
02:05:44,200 --> 02:05:45,500
Yakub! Gustad!

1666
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:47,600
Carry off Dilawar from here!

1667
02:06:10,600 --> 02:06:14,000
Children, congrats to you.

1668
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:18,000
The tribesmen have made
the decision in your favour.

1669
02:06:18,500 --> 02:06:20,600
Come out and see,
your fathers both...

1670
02:06:20,700 --> 02:06:23,700
... Chief Aatish Khan and
Chief Gul Khan, are here.

1671
02:06:24,200 --> 02:06:26,400
Now there is nothing
to fear about.

1672
02:06:29,600 --> 02:06:31,600
Salim! Salma!

1673
02:06:33,100 --> 02:06:34,400
Come out, children.

1674
02:06:42,200 --> 02:06:43,300
Salim...

1675
02:06:43,700 --> 02:06:46,100
... how come you're wounded?

1676
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:49,800
Tell me, children,
what's the matter?

1677
02:06:51,003 --> 02:06:52,502
Why are you so quiet?

1678
02:06:53,706 --> 02:06:56,673
Your silence will breed
a lot of questions.

1679
02:06:57,509 --> 02:06:59,167
Tell me, what happened?

1680
02:07:00,012 --> 02:07:03,311
Dilawar shot him, Mr. Shah.
- Dilawar?

1681
02:07:03,382 --> 02:07:05,942
I am going to revenge every
drop of blood that my son..

1682
02:07:06,118 --> 02:07:07,176
...has bled with Dilawar.

1683
02:07:07,252 --> 02:07:10,446
Dilawar has gone against
the tribe's decision.

1684
02:07:10,789 --> 02:07:12,188
I won't forgive him ever.

1685
02:07:12,257 --> 02:07:14,518
May God forgive me!

1686
02:07:15,828 --> 02:07:19,091
I command that Dilawar
should be shot at sight.

1687
02:07:19,500 --> 02:07:22,300
Cut his body into pieces...

1688
02:07:22,600 --> 02:07:24,600
So that everybody realized...

1689
02:07:25,100 --> 02:07:27,400
... what consequence
one has to face...

1690
02:07:27,500 --> 02:07:29,700
... to go against the decision
of the tribes.

1691
02:07:29,700 --> 02:07:35,100
We should thank Almighty
for granting long life to Salim.

1692
02:07:35,700 --> 02:07:38,700
Or else the bullet could have
pierced his chest too.

1693
02:07:42,400 --> 02:07:44,000
Chief Gul Khan...

1694
02:07:44,700 --> 02:07:46,400
... tonight itself you should go...

1695
02:07:46,400 --> 02:07:49,100
... to Chief Aatish Khan's place
with the procession...

1696
02:07:49,300 --> 02:07:52,600
... and bring Salma to your
home in a palanquin.

1697
02:07:53,900 --> 02:07:55,100
Chief Aatish Khan...

1698
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:58,200
... take your daughter home.

1699
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:01,100
Make her wear the bridal dress...

1700
02:08:02,600 --> 02:08:08,500
... so that the decision and
the wedding should culminate.

1701
02:08:08,600 --> 02:08:10,400
"Wonderful!"

1702
02:09:43,400 --> 02:09:45,400
May God protect you.

1703
02:09:49,500 --> 02:09:51,100
Who is this murderer?

1704
02:09:51,500 --> 02:09:53,200
Who is this savage?

1705
02:09:53,500 --> 02:09:56,300
Who killed these innocents
on such a joyous occasion?

1706
02:09:56,300 --> 02:09:58,100
Who is that brute?
- Dilawar!

1707
02:09:59,200 --> 02:10:00,800
Search for Dilawar!

1708
02:10:01,300 --> 02:10:04,900
And shoot him
if you find him! Go!

1709
02:10:06,600 --> 02:10:08,700
You're responsible
for this happiness!

1710
02:10:09,200 --> 02:10:10,900
It's God who...
- Chief!

1711
02:10:11,100 --> 02:10:12,900
Chief! There is news, sire...

1712
02:10:13,200 --> 02:10:15,200
... that Dilawar Khan
has bombed Salim...

1713
02:10:15,200 --> 02:10:17,200
... and the wedding procession.

1714
02:10:17,200 --> 02:10:18,300
No!

1715
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:20,100
No!

1716
02:10:33,500 --> 02:10:34,700
Chief...

1717
02:10:35,100 --> 02:10:37,500
... Dilawar once again
has tried to kill my son.

1718
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:39,100
Gul Khan...

1719
02:10:39,500 --> 02:10:43,100
... Dilawar hasn't got guts to
bomb a wedding procession.

1720
02:10:43,600 --> 02:10:46,200
I think Aatish Khan is behind this.

1721
02:10:46,700 --> 02:10:48,500
Now i am sure...

1722
02:10:49,200 --> 02:10:51,300
... that Aatish Khan doesn't
want his daughter....

1723
02:10:51,400 --> 02:10:53,500
... to be Salim's bride but instead...

1724
02:10:53,700 --> 02:10:56,300
... he wants Dilawar to be
his son-in-law. - No, sire.

1725
02:10:57,200 --> 02:10:59,300
Chief Aatish Khan
is a decent man...

1726
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:02,500
... he will never do this.
- So do you think i did this?

1727
02:11:02,900 --> 02:11:05,400
I killed these innocent people?
- But chief, i....

1728
02:11:05,400 --> 02:11:07,000
Keep quiet, Salim.

1729
02:11:07,900 --> 02:11:10,000
You're blinded by Salma's love.

1730
02:11:11,200 --> 02:11:13,400
After today,
you must forget Salma.

1731
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:18,400
Oh dear God!

1732
02:11:18,500 --> 02:11:20,000
No!

1733
02:11:20,339 --> 02:11:22,873
Salma! -Salma!
- Father!

1734
02:11:23,008 --> 02:11:24,507
Salma, open the door!

1735
02:11:24,509 --> 02:11:26,238
Open the door, Salma!
What's the matter?

1736
02:11:26,245 --> 02:11:29,007
Open the door, Salma!
- Salma! -Salma!

1737
02:11:29,081 --> 02:11:30,912
Open the door, Salma!
- Open the door!

1738
02:11:31,083 --> 02:11:33,276
Open the door, Salma!

1739
02:11:33,400 --> 02:11:35,200
Open the door, Salma!

1740
02:11:35,600 --> 02:11:36,800
Salma!

1741
02:11:39,400 --> 02:11:40,400
Salma!

1742
02:11:52,600 --> 02:11:55,100
Salma only belongs to Dilawar!

1743
02:11:58,200 --> 02:12:02,200
Brother, i will never
forgive my son Dilawar.

1744
02:12:03,100 --> 02:12:07,300
Go and shoot him.

1745
02:12:08,300 --> 02:12:10,600
I forgive you for
my son's murder.

1746
02:12:10,700 --> 02:12:12,400
Dilawar Khan!

1747
02:12:12,700 --> 02:12:14,200
Hey boy!

1748
02:12:15,700 --> 02:12:18,000
Mehboob.
- Hey boy!

1749
02:12:19,100 --> 02:12:20,400
Hey boy!

1750
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:23,100
Mehboob.

1751
02:12:26,500 --> 02:12:28,100
Hey boy!

1752
02:12:28,200 --> 02:12:29,500
Mehboob!

1753
02:12:32,400 --> 02:12:33,500
There he is!

1754
02:12:40,300 --> 02:12:41,500
Idiot!

1755
02:12:46,100 --> 02:12:47,300
You fool!

1756
02:12:50,900 --> 02:12:52,300
Mehboob, come down!

1757
02:12:54,300 --> 02:12:57,600
Come down!
- I am coming, sir!

1758
02:12:59,800 --> 02:13:01,900
I am coming!

1759
02:13:10,100 --> 02:13:12,600
Untie me, Mehboob! Untie me!

1760
02:13:13,600 --> 02:13:15,100
Untie me, Mehboob!

1761
02:13:22,600 --> 02:13:23,800
Bravo, Mehboob!

1762
02:13:24,500 --> 02:13:26,100
Tell me, what's happening
with Salma and Salim?

1763
02:13:26,200 --> 02:13:29,000
Salma is in jeopardy, sir.

1764
02:13:29,100 --> 02:13:30,400
Come on!
- Come on!

1765
02:13:34,100 --> 02:13:35,200
Wake up.

1766
02:13:41,200 --> 02:13:43,200
You arrogant!
- I must say...

1767
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:47,100
... i like girls who get wet.

1768
02:13:47,500 --> 02:13:51,500
Because their beauty is
revealed when they are wet.

1769
02:13:53,100 --> 02:13:54,200
Salma...

1770
02:13:54,900 --> 02:13:56,500
... shall i say something?

1771
02:13:57,500 --> 02:13:59,700
Do you know why have
i abducted you?

1772
02:14:00,100 --> 02:14:01,300
That's because at first...

1773
02:14:01,400 --> 02:14:03,500
... i would like to first
kiss your cheeks.

1774
02:14:03,600 --> 02:14:05,300
And then your lips.

1775
02:14:05,500 --> 02:14:09,200
And then i am going ravage you...

1776
02:14:10,100 --> 02:14:12,100
... so that people think...

1777
02:14:12,400 --> 02:14:16,200
... that Dilawar ravaged
and killed you.

1778
02:14:31,600 --> 02:14:33,500
Fakira! Abdullah! Ali!

1779
02:15:12,700 --> 02:15:14,100
No, no, dear!

1780
02:15:15,700 --> 02:15:17,200
Don't kill him for God's sake.

1781
02:15:17,300 --> 02:15:19,500
He'll support me when
i'll become old. - No!

1782
02:15:20,300 --> 02:15:23,000
He has supported
Halaku in his dirty act...

1783
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:25,200
... and for this he only
deserves death. - No...

1784
02:15:25,300 --> 02:15:28,200
No, Meer Dilawar,
forgive my son.

1785
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:30,700
I will repay, this...

1786
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:33,200
Father!

1787
02:15:36,200 --> 02:15:38,400
Shall i...

1788
02:15:39,600 --> 02:15:41,000
Goodbye.

1789
02:15:43,100 --> 02:15:47,100
I want to tell
you a secret before i die.

1790
02:15:47,300 --> 02:15:51,000
What secret?
- Your father's murderer...

1791
02:15:51,100 --> 02:15:54,500
I know that my father's
murderer is Gul Khan! - No...

1792
02:15:55,100 --> 02:15:56,300
... Meer Dilawar...

1793
02:15:57,200 --> 02:15:59,100
...Gul Khan is a...

1794
02:16:01,100 --> 02:16:02,500
... righteous man.

1795
02:16:04,500 --> 02:16:05,600
I've....

1796
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:11,000
... i've witnessed...

1797
02:16:11,400 --> 02:16:16,500
... your father's murder.

1798
02:16:16,900 --> 02:16:18,400
Aatish Khan and
Gul Khan's tribes are...

1799
02:16:18,400 --> 02:16:20,400
... getting on friendly terms again.

1800
02:16:21,100 --> 02:16:24,700
But today i am going to turn
that friendship into enmity.

1801
02:16:24,700 --> 02:16:26,300
But how brother?

1802
02:16:27,500 --> 02:16:28,700
Now in a while...

1803
02:16:29,500 --> 02:16:31,400
... Gul Khan will pass from here.

1804
02:16:32,400 --> 02:16:34,100
But he doesn't know...

1805
02:16:34,600 --> 02:16:37,100
... that Jalal Khan is waiting for him.

1806
02:16:44,100 --> 02:16:45,600
Gul Khan!

1807
02:16:46,700 --> 02:16:47,700
Jalal Khan?

1808
02:16:48,400 --> 02:16:49,700
What is he doing here?

1809
02:16:52,600 --> 02:16:54,200
Jalal Khan!

1810
02:17:09,900 --> 02:17:11,200
This is unfortunate.

1811
02:17:14,200 --> 02:17:16,300
Jalal Khan! Jalal Khan!

1812
02:17:17,400 --> 02:17:18,600
Jalal Khan!

1813
02:17:19,600 --> 02:17:21,100
Who was that idiot?

1814
02:17:21,500 --> 02:17:23,200
Who has shot him?

1815
02:17:24,600 --> 02:17:28,300
Jalal Khan! - Gul Khan,
why did you call me?

1816
02:17:28,400 --> 02:17:29,500
I did?

1817
02:17:30,200 --> 02:17:31,300
No, i didn't.

1818
02:17:32,300 --> 02:17:34,300
I was going to city
for some work...

1819
02:17:34,500 --> 02:17:36,700
... and i saw you while
passing from here.

1820
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:41,000
Come, come, i will take
you home. - No, no.

1821
02:17:41,900 --> 02:17:43,200
Goodbye.

1822
02:17:44,400 --> 02:17:45,700
Jalal Khan!

1823
02:17:46,400 --> 02:17:48,500
The foundation for enmity
has been laid.

1824
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:51,400
Gul Khan will be blamed
for this murder.

1825
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:54,000
May God forgive me!

1826
02:17:54,500 --> 02:17:56,300
And i'll instigate people saying...

1827
02:17:56,400 --> 02:17:59,700
... that Gul Khan has murdered
Aatish Khan's brother-in-law.

1828
02:18:00,500 --> 02:18:01,600
And then...

1829
02:18:02,200 --> 02:18:04,100
I will become chief of all chiefs...

1830
02:18:04,200 --> 02:18:07,100
... and rule all the tribes.

1831
02:18:17,300 --> 02:18:20,600
Good... bye!

1832
02:18:22,600 --> 02:18:23,800
Father.

1833
02:18:29,200 --> 02:18:31,300
Come, Salma, it's a long walk.

1834
02:18:42,100 --> 02:18:44,100
The world accused you...

1835
02:18:44,900 --> 02:18:46,700
... but i didn't believe any of them.

1836
02:18:47,400 --> 02:18:50,200
But today when i see
you with Salma...

1837
02:18:51,100 --> 02:18:53,700
... i really doubt my experience....

1838
02:18:54,500 --> 02:18:57,600
... that i was wrong
to recognize you.

1839
02:18:57,700 --> 02:19:01,200
Angel might make wrong
deductions, Mr. Shah but not you.

1840
02:19:01,200 --> 02:19:02,600
What do you mean?
- Sir...

1841
02:19:04,200 --> 02:19:06,600
... today i want to confess
to all the crimes.

1842
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:11,400
So call my uncle and
Chief Gul Khan here.

1843
02:19:12,600 --> 02:19:14,400
And wait for my arrival.

1844
02:19:15,900 --> 02:19:17,900
Salma, come dear.

1845
02:19:18,700 --> 02:19:20,000
Yes, Mr. Shah.

1846
02:19:28,960 --> 02:19:31,221
Who killed my son?

1847
02:19:33,164 --> 02:19:36,563
May God forgive me!

1848
02:19:37,602 --> 02:19:40,500
I'll massacre everyone!

1849
02:19:41,306 --> 02:19:43,931
Who is that brute? That savage?

1850
02:19:45,176 --> 02:19:48,441
Who did this injustice
to a father? Who is he?

1851
02:19:48,913 --> 02:19:51,438
Who caused me this great pain?

1852
02:19:51,549 --> 02:19:52,982
Who is he?

1853
02:19:54,519 --> 02:19:55,611
I did!

1854
02:19:57,500 --> 02:19:59,600
Dilawar Khan has murdered him.

1855
02:20:01,200 --> 02:20:04,000
I have caused you this pain,
because you...

1856
02:20:04,500 --> 02:20:06,100
... you have killed my father.

1857
02:20:06,200 --> 02:20:08,200
May God forgive me!

1858
02:20:14,272 --> 02:20:15,330
Back off!

1859
02:20:16,541 --> 02:20:20,602
Listen and see carefully
before you die, Dilawar!

1860
02:20:21,679 --> 02:20:26,275
I have killed your father,
and I will keep killing people.

1861
02:20:27,200 --> 02:20:28,600
I'll keep creating rift
between tribes...

1862
02:20:28,600 --> 02:20:31,000
... and i'll still be a chief.

1863
02:20:31,200 --> 02:20:33,300
And the fools like you will die!

1864
02:20:54,100 --> 02:20:55,300
Angara Khan...

1865
02:20:56,600 --> 02:20:58,300
... i won't kill you.

1866
02:20:59,700 --> 02:21:02,200
It's the chiefs
who will decide your fate.

1867
02:21:40,300 --> 02:21:42,100
Dilawar, forgive me.

1868
02:21:42,400 --> 02:21:45,300
Dilawar, i say, forgive me!

1869
02:21:45,700 --> 02:21:46,800
Dilawar!

1870
02:21:49,700 --> 02:21:50,900
Dilawar!

1871
02:21:53,400 --> 02:21:55,400
Dilawar, listen to me! Dilawar!

1872
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:04,100
Dilawar!

1873
02:22:05,000 --> 02:22:06,700
Dilawar! I say, stop, Dilawar!

1874
02:22:10,500 --> 02:22:11,600
Come!

1875
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:15,200
Come, you idiot!

1876
02:22:19,000 --> 02:22:20,200
Look Gul Khan...

1877
02:22:20,400 --> 02:22:22,700
... what has Dilawar has
done to me?

1878
02:22:23,400 --> 02:22:26,200
I am the chief of all chiefs,
Gul Khan!

1879
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:29,000
He took a shot at Salim...

1880
02:22:29,400 --> 02:22:31,100
... but God saved him.

1881
02:22:31,500 --> 02:22:33,700
He went against tribe's decision.

1882
02:22:33,700 --> 02:22:37,400
And i gave orders to
kill Dilawar Khan!

1883
02:22:38,100 --> 02:22:40,700
This brute has revenged me
for the same order!

1884
02:22:42,200 --> 02:22:44,400
He killed my son Halaku...

1885
02:22:44,700 --> 02:22:47,100
... then he killed my brother
Rashid Khan.

1886
02:22:47,300 --> 02:22:50,600
And now he is humiliating
me before all of you!

1887
02:22:51,200 --> 02:22:52,400
Gul Khan...

1888
02:22:53,200 --> 02:22:55,400
... finish off this monster!

1889
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:58,696
Or else this brute might
murder lot of people.

1890
02:22:58,970 --> 02:23:00,528
Shut your mouth, Angara Khan.

1891
02:23:01,239 --> 02:23:02,365
Tell me the truth!

1892
02:23:03,041 --> 02:23:06,169
Who took a shot at my son?
Who did it?

1893
02:23:06,444 --> 02:23:08,935
May God forgive me, Gul Khan.

1894
02:23:09,400 --> 02:23:11,100
Your son is like a son to me.

1895
02:23:11,100 --> 02:23:12,800
How can i shoot him?

1896
02:23:15,300 --> 02:23:17,500
Tell the truth, you idiot!
And only the truth!

1897
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:20,800
Nothing but the truth!

1898
02:23:23,000 --> 02:23:25,200
Tell us, who tried to kill Salim?

1899
02:23:25,800 --> 02:23:27,000
Tell us.

1900
02:23:27,600 --> 02:23:28,700
Tell us!

1901
02:23:30,200 --> 02:23:31,400
I did.

1902
02:23:32,100 --> 02:23:33,700
And who was it?

1903
02:23:35,300 --> 02:23:36,400
My son, Halaku!

1904
02:23:36,400 --> 02:23:38,700
Who bombed the
wedding procession?

1905
02:23:39,100 --> 02:23:40,200
I did.

1906
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:44,200
Aatish Khan,
save me for God's sake.

1907
02:23:44,300 --> 02:23:46,300
Stop your nephew!
He will kill me!

1908
02:23:46,300 --> 02:23:47,600
Save me, Aatish Khan.

1909
02:23:48,500 --> 02:23:51,200
Who abducted my daughter?

1910
02:23:51,700 --> 02:23:53,000
My son Halaku.

1911
02:23:57,200 --> 02:23:59,400
Who murdered my father?

Mr. Shah, i am a murderer,
a killer and a criminal.

02:24:13,900 --> 02:24:16,700
I did all this just to retain
my powers.

1920
02:24:38,100 --> 02:24:41,000
Even a decent man like
Mr. Shah terned away from you.

1921
02:24:42,400 --> 02:24:44,600
It means that life has
turned away from you. - No...

don't kill me.

Dilawar! Dilawar!

1924

Dilawar, don't kill me. Forgive
me, for God's sake! Dilawar!

1925
02:24:55,600 --> 02:24:58,400
Forgive me, for God's sake!
No, Dilawar! No, no!

1926
02:25:11,400 --> 02:25:14,100
May God forgive you!

1927
02:25:14,700 --> 02:25:16,500
