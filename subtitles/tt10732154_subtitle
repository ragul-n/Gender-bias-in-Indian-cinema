00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,200
PREMA JANTA
[LOVE COUPLE]

2
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:36,510
These lovers are example for true love.

3
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:45,920
Parents have parted the love couple.

4
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,210
Love couples are cursed by castes.

5
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:58,970
Lovers committed suicide in fear
 of marriage denial by parents.

6
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:18,960
Suicides of love couples
 have crossed 1000 in the year.

7
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:25,550
Boyfriend committed suicide for the girlfriend.

8
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:10,880
Their deaths conceived as
suicides rather murders.

9
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,250
What a plan!

10
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,750
Send that video to sir
via Whatsapp.

11
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,190
Okay.

12
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:19,370
But, how can a father
 kill his own son?

13
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:23,980
I was not there when
this was happening.

14
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,350
What made him to kill his own son?

15
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:30,800
As you assume,
this guy is not his son.

16
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:34,200
This guy's father has
died in his childhood.

17
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,400
His mother was married to another man.

18
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,750
This guy loved a girl and
asked for her property.

19
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:12,520
That is what happened.

20
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,950
Our boss killed him for wealth,
and that guy was not his son.

21
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:19,130
Leave it be.

22
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:21,919
Did you send him
the video or not?

23
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,270
Yeah, I did.

24
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,349
You killed our son?
-Yes.

25
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:33,760
How inhumane are you to kill our son?
-Shut up, you lame bitch.

26
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:36,719
If you let our daughter know this,
I will kill you both.

27
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:37,929
Just stay away.

28
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:41,360
You didn't raise the son well.

29
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,560
At least raise our daughter well.

30
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:18,120
I LOVE YOU!

31
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:22,890
Wait, dude.

32
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:26,489
Did he again dream of
that girl proposing him?

33
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:45,659
You faulty brat!

34
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,330
You wasted my flour.

35
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:50,300
I toiled to winnow jowar.

36
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:52,299
You ruined my hard work.

37
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,930
Something's messed up I guess.

38
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,530
Did my mother
start yelling again?

39
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:57,000
The prices have gone up.

40
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:58,640
Who will pay for this?

41
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,150
She won't change.

42
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,070
You parents passed away happily
and burdened us with you.

43
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:08,560
It's been a waste to feed you.

44
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:10,539
Moreover your craziness
 has resulted this.

45
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:13,600
I will not feed
for you the day.

46
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:14,919
Go and beg for alms .

47
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:16,090
Hey, shut up!

48
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,539
What's that nonsense
with our future son-in-law?

49
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:21,600
To whom will
he be son-in-law?

50
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:24,600
His interest in
styling seems like

51
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:27,390
he might bring
a girl to home directly.

52
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:34,650
His mother, who is your sister,
has eloped with a guy and burdened us with him.

53
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,620
Parents habits are
inherited undoubtedly.

54
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:39,680
He neither is rich nor has anyone.

55
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:43,000
Considering what should I
marry off my daughter to him?

56
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,460
Mother, enough!

57
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:45,520
Go inside.

58
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,760
I'm the earner in the home.

59
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,140
What's the loss for you?

60
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:53,099
Have you brought
anything from your home?

61
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:54,440
Not even a single penny.

62
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,620
Bragging like your
wealth is melting away.

63
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:00,619
As you were insufficient for yourself,
you've come as second wife to me.

64
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:04,080
Continue whining.
I lost my peace at home because of him.

65
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,650
Such men stay at home without any shame.

66
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,280
I wish he could get away at least.

67
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,930
You knew that my
mother yells at everything.

68
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:39,580
Why are you crying then?

69
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:40,860
Calm down, dude.

70
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:44,080
I feel like leaving home.

71
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:48,830
I'm thinking to find
some work and stay there.

72
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:49,920
Stop it!

73
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:53,470
Listen! Haven't we taken your
farm after your mother died?

74
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,120
Otherwise we wouldn't have any farm.

75
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,150
Until recently, my mother
 used to go out for work.

76
00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:00,700
After getting your farm, she was
able to be at home, and got cocky.

77
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,560
Stop minding all these.

78
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:04,830
Don't think anything stupid.

79
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:06,360
Come, let's go.

80
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:07,370
Get up.

81
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:09,100
I will not come.

82
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,390
Jaffar promised to
teach me driving auto rickshaw.

83
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,640
I will earn from it
and stay outside.

84
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:16,840
Our Jaffar?
-Yes.

85
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,780
He is not Jaffar but a rogue.

86
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:20,160
You believe him?

87
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:22,039
We cannot trust him.

88
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:23,470
Alright. Tell me something.

89
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:24,969
Why did the flour fall?

90
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,520
You assumed that girl
proposing you again, right?

91
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:31,740
But, this doesn't seem admiring.

92
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,920
Even in dreams you
expect that girl to propose you?

93
00:08:34,059 --> 00:08:35,479
Don't you dare to propose her in dreams?

94
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,900
Your fear won't
get you anything.

95
00:08:38,169 --> 00:08:39,079
I don't mind what you feel.

96
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:40,680
You smiled?

97
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:43,580
I came to know
what's your weakness.

98
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:47,600
In case you plan to leave home,
don't go with empty hands.

99
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:50,270
You have to hold Nandu's hands and leave.

100
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,100
Try to get a seat in IIIT as she said.

101
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:55,630
Study in that college for six years.

102
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,810
After that get a
good job and get married.

103
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:00,750
Till then I will give
 you my full support.

104
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:04,199
Just don't mind my
mother's yelling and Jaffar's ill-advice.

105
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:04,990
Okay.

106
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:07,280
You know what?

107
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,400
Tenth class exam
results will be out today.

108
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,030
They indeed are
your love results.

109
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,840
If you rank 1st in mandal zone then
you will study in IIIT for six years.

110
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:18,760
Hey, it's Jaffar.

111
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:22,440
Where you have been?
I was searching for you.

112
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,190
Our tenth class
results will be out today.

113
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,070
"Our?"

114
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,000
Those are our tenth class results.

115
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:29,480
Not only you,
even I have written the exams.

116
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:33,760
Not written.
You have been writing for six years.

117
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:35,150
Even after getting age-barred.

118
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:38,990
Call me anything
but not age-barred.

119
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:41,800
What else do we
call an age-barred guy?

120
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,530
What will you do if
you pass?

121
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:44,940
Just keep riding the auto.

122
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:49,020
I dream of going to college
and enjoying the college life.

123
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:55,680
Hey, will you pass
the examination for this time?

124
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,940
For sure.

125
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:58,810
You told me the same last time.

126
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:03,160
You won't believe me,
I got quite a lenient invigilator this time.

127
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,430
I copied a lot.

128
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:06,040
I will pass this time undoubtedly.

129
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,569
As expected it's a long queue.

130
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,560
Hey, Where are you going?

131
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,560
Follow the queue.

132
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,290
I work here.
-Okay, go.

133
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,290
Who is lying there?

134
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:18,320
Have you lost your senses?

135
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,600
Every working official is here.
Quietly follow the line.

136
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,800
Bloody! Come back.

137
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:23,180
Just joked.

138
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:25,449
You passed in exams.

139
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:29,319
You too have passed.

140
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,400
Dude, my neighbour girl passed in exams.

141
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,520
If I fail I will lose
 my respect in home.

142
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,490
What shall we do now?

143
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:39,640
You have passed.

144
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,240
Girls are succeeding,
 what about us?

145
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,240
You passed in exams.

146
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:46,969
You got failed.

147
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,680
Let it be. My life has been
confined to worship in temple.

148
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:52,080
You are held for malpractice.

149
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:55,290
You have to wait for ten
more days to get your results.

150
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:56,650
Move.
-Move aside.

151
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:00,810
Everyone is worried for tenth results.
But he has to worry about his love too.

152
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,290
Get lost.

153
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,859
You ranked first in district.

154
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:38,160
"Delightful!"

155
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:56,940
"It's delightful to be with you."

156
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:04,600
"It's delightful to dream with you."

157
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:09,040
"My rush towards your
cute expressions is delightful."

158
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:13,040
"My hurry towards your voice is delightful."

159
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:16,800
"My victory towards your
smiling desires is delightful."

160
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:20,480
"The seven holy footsteps
towards your walking feet are delightful."

161
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:27,689
"It's delightful to be with you."

162
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,720
"It's delightful to dream with you."

163
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,580
"First sight is delightful."

164
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,400
"First smile is delightful."

165
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:06,880
"First love is delightful."

166
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,440
"First talk is delightful."

167
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,040
"First game is delightful."

168
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,079
"It's delightful if first love works out."

169
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,780
"For the first time I myself
felt delightful because of you."

170
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:22,089
"The meaning of first love is delightful."

171
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,189
"This illusion is delightful."

172
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,190
"This joy is delightful."

173
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:23,800
"My every day and night is delightful."

174
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:26,080
"My age is delightful."

175
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,080
"Your pair is delightful."

176
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:31,320
"My everyday is delightful."

177
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:33,689
"This stupor is yours."

178
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:35,520
"Your world is delightful."

179
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:38,970
"The day of pairing
with you is delightful."

180
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:18,280
Brother! Brother!

181
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,839
I've sent your brother to the city.

182
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,390
Why are you asking for him?

183
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:26,000
I ranked second in tenth class
examinations in our district.

184
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,949
You boast like you got a first rank.

185
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:29,740
Go to your room.

186
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:31,520
Go.

187
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:35,740
Father!

188
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:39,079
I would get a seat if applied in IIIT.

189
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:41,839
Can you get me an application form?

190
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:44,540
End your studies at once.

191
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:49,610
These girls doesn't need any education.

192
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:52,460
Just nod your head,
I will marry her off to my son.

193
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,040
It will be done soon.

194
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:58,600
I will see for an auspicious day.

195
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:02,170
Dear, you must eat well
and put on some weight.

196
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:05,740
Otherwise, my son
would seem fat to others.

197
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:10,439
I'm willing to study further, father.

198
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,270
To do what?

199
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,690
You have to marry him anyhow.

200
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:14,940
That's why I wish to send you now.

201
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:15,920
Now, get inside.

202
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:18,300
She is just a kid.
What's hurry to marry her off now?

203
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:19,870
Hey, stop countering me.

204
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:21,840
I don't tolerate such arguments.

205
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:22,570
Get inside.

206
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:25,930
You see for an auspicious day.

207
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:28,460
Hey, don't overindulge
in eating and become fat.

208
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:29,440
Stay in control.

209
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:31,469
Somehow, I will marry her to you.

210
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:33,069
So that we can get all this wealth.

211
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:33,880
Understand?

212
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:47,260
We don't have to
pay any fee if I join IIIT.

213
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:50,729
We can study there for
six years for free if we get a seat.

214
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:52,719
Six years?

215
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,250
You sound like it's just six days?

216
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:59,320
You think we are rich?

217
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:01,580
There's nothing you
can do by studying.

218
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:03,070
Stop everything
and find a work.

219
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,280
Mother! That is a government college.

220
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:07,520
They offer scholarships to students.

221
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:10,440
He isn't aware of those.
Stop blabbering.

222
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:12,360
I don't care all those.

223
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:16,220
He better find some work
and earn some money.

224
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:17,660
Otherwise, I won't tolerate.

225
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,919
I don't understand such things.

226
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:23,040
But, I will ask who is aware of it.

227
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:24,839
Just wait for a day.

228
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:25,900
Okay, uncle.

229
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:27,870
Bloody hell!

230
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,950
Don't know which girl
will be my classmate.

231
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:33,390
If they know that I ride auto rickshaw,
 no girl wishes to look at me.

232
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,390
As if every girl is behind you now.

233
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:37,870
I cannot survive without
running this auto rickshaw.

234
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:39,480
But If I run this, I will lose my respect.

235
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,200
Dude, customers are coming.

236
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,310
Your number is next, go ahead.

237
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,340
She seems like Chandu's girlfriend.

238
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:50,560
Hop in. Where to?

239
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:52,990
To temple.
-Okay, come in.

240
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,659
Is this the time to go to a temple?

241
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:04,240
I asked you to come in the morning.
But you came now.

242
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,840
I have set an alarm. It rang.

243
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:09,480
I turned it off and thought
to wake up after five minutes.

244
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,200
But it slept for more time.

245
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,959
Leave it be.
Did you apply for IIIT or not?

246
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:15,200
No.

247
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:16,830
My father is denying.

248
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:20,680
He is willing to drop my studies
and marry me off to my uncle's son.

249
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:21,920
Marriage?

250
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:23,960
At this young age?

251
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,150
Encouraging minor marriage is a crime.

252
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,780
Hey, why do you care?

253
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,140
Mind your own business.

254
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:31,500
What's this?

255
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,689
Is it right to drop off studies
after ranking top?

256
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,980
If you don't mind,
I have an advice.

257
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:39,720
If joining IIIT is not possible
then go for local colleges.

258
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,440
I will inform the
same to my friend.

259
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:42,510
Who is your friend?

260
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:43,720
What will you inform him?

261
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:46,800
I mean... I will talk to your father.

262
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:50,040
After all, making a clever
student to drop studies is unfair.

263
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:52,040
It's unnecessary for you.
Stop the auto.

264
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:54,000
Okay. Should I wait
to take you return?

265
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,020
No need. You can go.

266
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,750
You think I would wait?

267
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:58,400
I will rush to Chandu
and tell him everything.

268
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:08,350
What happened?

269
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:11,310
What that hurry
as if someone died?

270
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,230
It's really that important.

271
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:13,820
What happened?

272
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:17,709
I just rushed here after
dropping off your lover at the temple.

273
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:19,179
Which temple? Let's go.

274
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,210
First listen what I had to say.

275
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,940
You topped first rank and
cracked seat in IIIT for her.

276
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,220
But her parents are planning to
drop her studies and marry her off.

277
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:31,240
I heard all of this while
they were talking in my auto.

278
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,379
It's better to forget her.

279
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,740
Don't be sad.

280
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,980
What can we do if
fate is against us?

281
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:57,140
You could get more
better girl for your talent.

282
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:58,920
No.

283
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,680
We must do something to stop it.

284
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:04,300
They are about to see an auspicious day.
 What else can we do now?

285
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:09,260
I have an idea.

286
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:11,400
Who will set an auspicious day?

287
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:13,439
Our Sharma's father.

288
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,020
First, we must manage Sharma.

289
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:23,280
I'm very happy to see friends
who are struggling to get a girl educated.

290
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:29,040
Compared to your struggle,
cannot I do such small favour?

291
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:33,140
However, my father is out of village
and will return in a week.

292
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:34,919
You get going.
I will take care.

293
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,000
Hey, he is coming. Go and hide.
-Let's hide.

294
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,320
What do you want?

295
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,620
Where is you father?

296
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,060
He's not there. Why?

297
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:56,740
Alright, I will come later.

298
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,480
Wait. What's so hurry?

299
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:02,520
My father will be back in a week.
If you want to set an auspicious day then I can.

300
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:04,560
Can you set it properly?

301
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,420
Of course, I do.

302
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,199
My father is good at
seeing old astrology.

303
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,240
But he seeks my advice
for modern astrology.

304
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,100
Is there such thing
as modern astrology?

305
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:14,780
If technology can be updated,
astrology too can.

306
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:16,760
What's the relation
between those two?

307
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,200
You are here to speak
about your son. Am I right?

308
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,220
How do you know?

309
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:22,240
That is called modern astrology.
-Really?

310
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,140
You can turn back
if you don't believe me.

311
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,460
No, I'm okay with it. Tell me.

312
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:30,260
As per your son's astrology,
he is impotent to marry for a year.

313
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:43,420
He is scared to tell you this.

314
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,860
So, does it get well after a year?

315
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:48,300
Does he get potency?

316
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,400
I will tell you that after a year.

317
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,139
You are able to think
in all aspects at such young age.

318
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:58,680
No matter what, you will
become as great as your father.

319
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:14,760
Eat well.

320
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,440
I still can bring
more if you want.

321
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:25,160
Did you set an
auspicious day for marriage?

322
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,820
I feel... that we should
set the marriage a year later.

323
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,720
You yourself went out to set an
auspicious day from the priest.

324
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:33,840
What happened now?

325
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:38,960
Our scriptures suggest us to not conduct
any marriages within the year of someone's demise.

326
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,340
Those scriptures suggest us to
conduct marriages if we perform final rites.

327
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:44,280
If needed we can
perform the final rites of demised.

328
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,220
But let's not postpone the
marriage for some vague reason.

329
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:49,500
If you have
something then be honest.

330
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,899
No, there isn't such thing.

331
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:54,879
Any marriage demands the
couple to live together forever.

332
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:57,340
And for it to happen...

333
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:01,520
I feel it's best to wait for a year.

334
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,360
Your wish.

335
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,180
Find an auspicious day after a year.

336
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:06,620
Okay.

337
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:10,040
Father, can I take admission in the college?

338
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:13,480
See, she wants to study
for postponing the marriage.

339
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:17,100
Forget studies. Be at home and learn how to cook.

340
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:18,659
Let her go, brother-in-law.

341
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,620
What she will do
staying at home for a year?

342
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:24,820
Rather joining her in IIIT college,
let us join her in local college.

343
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:26,680
Alright, your wish.

344
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,660
Brother-in-law seems happy today.

345
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:32,240
Heroines are coming.

346
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,360
Take us to Nalanda College.

347
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,620
I knew where you want to go.
-You again?

348
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:36,879
We will find another auto.

349
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,480
I just joked. Come, I will take you.

350
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:42,480
Chandu will fly high
with excitement from today.

351
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:46,399
God helps the sufferers.
-Better, shut up and drive.

352
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,820
Dude, our plan worked.

353
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,780
You will throw a party
if you listen what I have to say.

354
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,300
Nandu has taken admission in Nalanda college.

355
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:02,280
Shit! How can we join in that college?

356
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,660
Aunt won't agree to pay fee for it.

357
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:08,860
Dude! Toppers get free seat in any college.

358
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,239
I guess Nandu too has got a free seat.

359
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:13,379
Then let's join the college today itself.

360
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:15,120
Okay. All the best.

361
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,660
Don't be scared as in tenth class.

362
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,820
Do you get it?
-Yeah.

363
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:21,900
Now go home and convince your aunt.

364
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,940
Hey, always busy looking yourself in mirror?

365
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:27,260
Come and eat along.

366
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:28,800
Mind me not. Continue eating.

367
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:32,660
Son-in-law, I just enquired and understood
that you can join in that college.

368
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,080
When do you plan to join in IIIT?

369
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:40,100
Uncle, even I've enquired
 after listening to Aunt.

370
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,159
The fee there is pretty high.

371
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:45,840
That's why I changed my mind to
 join Nalanda college in Adilabad.

372
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:50,820
Choosing private college
over government college?

373
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:53,080
You think it's easy to pay fee?

374
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:56,139
Mother! College will offer free seat for the toppers.

375
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,400
There is no need to pay any fee.

376
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:00,899
Then why are you studying?

377
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:03,300
You could have studied
well and got a free seat, right?

378
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:06,100
To hell with me!

379
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:10,699
I'm getting feelings on every
girl after passing tenth class.

380
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,780
Girls have more feelings than us.

381
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,199
But they hide their feelings,
and we express.

382
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:21,740
Such a big college building!

383
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:23,580
Even the students will
come from rich families.

384
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:32,440
Dude, our schoolmate,
Rohith too joined here.

385
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:43,260
A girl named Nandu will arrive now.

386
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:46,879
No one should dare
to even look at her.

387
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:48,959
I'm warning you.

388
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,360
I'm not responsible
if something goes wrong.

389
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:56,960
"Our relation brought us together
after waiting for so long."

390
00:25:57,060 --> 00:26:01,360
"My first joy is not a dream but a reality."

391
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,280
Nandu must be our Bi.P.C group.

392
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:17,860
Where is MPC class room?

393
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,300
Second floor.
-Thank you.

394
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,460
I have been warning you.
Didn't you hear me?

395
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:31,060
Hello!
Cut off your cockiness,.

396
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,060
I'm talking to him.

397
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:36,020
Who are you?
-Inter first year, MPC.

398
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:38,600
Studying at late age?

399
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:42,300
Speak whatever but don't bring age in between.
-Get lost!

400
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,379
We know you for long time.

401
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,680
What did you do for Nandu?

402
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:47,580
I know her since my tenth.

403
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:51,820
I planned to study in Hyderabad.
But joined here just for her.

404
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:54,960
Isn't his enough to show
how interested I'm on her?

405
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,240
Do you know what my friend did then?

406
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:58,540
He ranked first in district
in tenth just for her.

407
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:00,980
He let go off a free seat in IIIT college.

408
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:02,899
Leave it be.
-Wait!

409
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:06,640
It doesn't matter who did what for her.

410
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,920
What matters is to
whom she will fall in love with.

411
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:12,360
Nandu's seems more of
Miss Andhra and Miss India level.

412
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,459
Such top level girl falling
for you is mere impossible.

413
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:19,000
Many have written exams,
but my friend scored first among them.

414
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,500
The same applies here.

415
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:23,300
Be it top rank or top level girl,
it will fall for him.

416
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:24,040
Enough! Move now.

417
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:26,000
Feeling jealous! Get lost.

418
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,560
Sir is coming!
Everyone sit down.

419
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,480
Move, idiot!

420
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:57,340
Greetings sir!

421
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:01,100
You feel yourselves as kids still?

422
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:03,340
Lagging to even greet.

423
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:06,220
Now that you've come to intermediate,
a decent Good Morning would do.

424
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:07,580
Good Morning sir!

425
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,120
Good. Now sit down!

426
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,460
Thank you, sir!

427
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,160
Dear students, welcome to Intermediate!

428
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,160
I'm Nikhilesh,
your mathematics lecturer.

429
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:19,020
Dear, your name is Nandini, right?

430
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,240
Yes, sir.

431
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:22,980
I have seen you on the newspaper.
You ranked second right?

432
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,000
Yes, sir.

433
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:26,720
You could have joined in IIIT, right?
Why did you join here?

434
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:28,680
I have another goal, sir.

435
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:31,160
Sir, even my friend
 ranked first in district.

436
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:35,260
Oh! There are two
toppers in our class.

437
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:40,320
Nandini has a goal to be here.
What about you?

438
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,740
He wants to be her husband.

439
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:42,360
Shut up!

440
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:44,879
I too have a goal, sir.

441
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,660
Wow, sit down!

442
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:49,760
So, there are two
district toppers in our class.

443
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:53,219
I didn't join IIIT because
of issues at home.

444
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,860
What made
him to not join IIIT?

445
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:59,860
Holy shit! Don't
involve me in such things.

446
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,980
He may tell you that
he joined here for you.

447
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:04,480
How would I know?
Please, don't disturb me.

448
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,840
Rohith has changed course from Bi.P.C to MPC.

449
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:12,000
Forget him. Look, Nandu is coming.

450
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:20,139
See, how Chandu is staring at her.

451
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:23,460
Nandu has got good impression
upon him the first day itself.

452
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:27,300
If you keep quiet,
things get hard to deal.

453
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,659
See, how I will book
 him in front of Nandu.

454
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:30,520
What will you do?

455
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:32,220
Wait and see.

456
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:33,780
Did you find any girl attractive?

457
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,679
I like that green dress girl.

458
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:36,920
That bumpy nose girl?

459
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,420
Hello Nandu, just a minute.

460
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:41,620
What's he up to?
-Who knows!

461
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:42,860
Yes.

462
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:45,640
A guy in our college is
spreading rumors on you.

463
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:47,959
On me?

464
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,140
Who is that guy?

465
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:50,960
There he is.

466
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:53,040
He is showing us.

467
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:54,340
Is he mad or what?

468
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:57,760
He is telling that he loves you and
secured first rank in district for you.

469
00:29:57,940 --> 00:29:59,100
He is wanting us to believe it.

470
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:00,580
He is warning everyone.

471
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:01,379
What a waste guy!

472
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:03,560
I'm informing you so
that you would control him.

473
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:08,800
Listen, a guy spreading rumors
and you carrying it to me is shit.

474
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:09,480
Thanks.

475
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:12,240
I don't care all such fuss.
Now, you can mind your business.

476
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,200
Dude, he booked us.

477
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:17,460
Yes.

478
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:21,639
Hey! What are you doing here? Get lost!

479
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:25,900
I don't understand what you are doing.

480
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:27,400
Why are you highlighting him now?

481
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:30,820
You felt that Nandu got his
impression the very first day.

482
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:33,179
I started conversing with her
by speaking against him.

483
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:37,260
If I manage to build a relation with her,

484
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,560
then she may fall for me by
looking at my star level maintenance.

485
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:43,220
It's a shitty plan.
What if she falls for him?

486
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,760
All your plans seem pitiful.

487
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:48,480
Hey, what are you doing here? Move now.

488
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,840
His nuisance has become more in the college.

489
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:53,580
I find this group overdoing in this batch.

490
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,600
Hey, age-barred!
 It's all because of you.

491
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:57,959
Nandu came to know all of this.

492
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,540
By the way,
why did he tell her about us?

493
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:01,960
Don't worry.
I'll take care if something goes wrong.

494
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:09,320
First day of college brought
me proposals and jealousies.

495
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,260
Then what's coming next might be a war.

496
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:14,380
He secured district first rank for me?

497
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,400
Shall we enquire about it?

498
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:18,820
What's the use?

499
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:21,900
He followed me all the year,

500
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:23,420
became topper,

501
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:27,720
and wanted to join IIIT to impress me.

502
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:31,160
He again dropped joining IIIT as I didn't.

503
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:34,020
How much he must be
loving me to do all those?

504
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:37,660
It's a sin to ignore
such a loving person.

505
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:39,240
Disgusting!

506
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:40,720
Confess that you like him.

507
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:41,540
Whatever!

508
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:43,080
What if he really
did all those for me?

509
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:44,620
Enough!

510
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:47,260
My neighbour aunt
works as clerk in our school.

511
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:48,380
I'll find the truth.

512
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,100
Really? Then find out.

513
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:55,140
Why are you so happy?

514
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:56,880
It's for you.

515
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,040
I found out Chandu's details.

516
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:00,100
What's the matter?

517
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:02,380
What Rohith spoke to you is true.

518
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:04,199
Chandu is from our school.

519
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:06,760
We couldn't get to know
him as ours isn't co-education.

520
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:09,360
He never ranked first in his class.

521
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:12,560
That's why everyone's wondering how
did he secure first rank in district.

522
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,220
They are watching us from the stairs.

523
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:19,159
So, what Rohith told
us are truths then.

524
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,140
Absolutely.

525
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:22,620
She came to know about us.

526
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:23,860
What to do now?

527
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:26,660
He has applied for IIIT.

528
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:28,179
But he cancelled it later.

529
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:29,740
Hi!
-Hi!

530
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:32,580
She is gorgeous even from the back.

531
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,660
What's the discussion here?
Move to classes.

532
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,179
They started bragging even
before the freshers party.

533
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,700
God knows what they turn
into after freshers party.

534
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:46,420
"Yesterdays kids...

535
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:50,360
"...became heroes today."

536
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,959
"Those who wore briefs
alone till yesterday...

537
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:58,420
"...are posing like stars today."

538
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:01,560
"Yesterdays kids...

539
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,320
"...became heroes today."

540
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:09,180
"Those who wore briefs
alone till yesterday...

541
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:13,080
"...are posing like stars today."

542
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:20,520
"Tender moustaches, gutsy angers
 have sprung in intermediate life."

543
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:02,620
"Girls to the one side..."

544
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:04,479
"Boys to the other side..."

545
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:08,159
"They are not friends yet they
panic to face each other."

546
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,340
"Inter books to the one side..."

547
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:12,240
"Cunning looks the other side..."

548
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:16,080
"Parents worry on what they
would become in the end..."

549
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:18,020
"Idiots are unknown..."

550
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:20,020
"Intelligents are unknown..."

551
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:23,480
"But the common ground for
them is Intermediate life."

552
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,320
"Annoying each other in classrooms..."

553
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,320
"Keeping discussions at the canteen..."

554
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:01,740
"They cheer at the
stupid acts in the campus."

555
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:03,979
"They bring double meaning conversations..."

556
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:05,980
"They show two feelings at once..."

557
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:09,740
"College for teens is the
home for noisy commotions."

558
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:11,799
"Many unknown doubts..."

559
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,560
"Yet they don't try to express..."

560
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:17,100
"The common centre for
 confusion is Intermediate life."

561
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,380
"They are just kids."

562
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,060
"Are they really heroes?"

563
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:28,620
"I will pull off their briefs."

564
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:32,140
"Enough it."

565
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,899
Can I call Nandu as sister?

566
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:45,860
Sister has come.

567
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:51,060
I insisted you to not interfere.

568
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:53,060
See, you made them get closer.

569
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,840
He is really overdoing in this matter.

570
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,400
I have to teach him a lesson.

571
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,320
Find him alone anywhere.

572
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:22,880
I have to go. Move.

573
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,920
Why are you overacting in front of Nandu?

574
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:38,960
You told me that Nandu
belongs to whom she loves.

575
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:41,540
Are you afraid that
Nandu might fall for me?

576
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,180
Fear didn't exist
in my history.

577
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:48,419
Leave history.
Let's get this done ourselves.

578
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:52,080
Really? Guys, he scared.

579
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:53,820
What will you do? Beat me?

580
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:57,340
Beat me. Come on, beat me.

581
00:36:58,420 --> 00:36:59,520
You are that gutsy?

582
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,700
Beat me then. Come on.

583
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,240
Nandu has come.

584
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,459
Dude, Nandu has come.

585
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,339
What are you doing there?

586
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:23,919
I'm working alone here.

587
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:25,220
Continue then.
-Help me here.

588
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:27,460
See, how mad he has become,
staring at the chain.

589
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,319
Daily you travel in my auto for free.

590
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,480
Bloody rickety auto.

591
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:33,400
Always lands into a repair.

592
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,620
Then ask your dad to buy me a new one.

593
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:36,760
Keep wishing!

594
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,480
Fix it. Bloody age-barred punk!

595
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:40,800
Don't ever call me age-barred!
 I will hit you with this.

596
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:42,100
Shut up and fix it.

597
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:47,840
Dude, she taught him a nice lesson.

598
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:50,420
That scoundrel will not
show up for another month.

599
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:51,760
Brother-in-law,

600
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:54,440
Haven't you understood
anything of her action?

601
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:55,700
What have you understood?

602
00:38:57,100 --> 00:39:00,839
Dude, she tied Rakhi to him
after knowing that he had hit you.

603
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:02,020
Why didn't she tie it to you?

604
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:03,319
What's the implication behind this?

605
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:06,960
As he was torturing her,
she tied it to him in the class.

606
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,600
If I do the same, she will tie it to me too.

607
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,160
Oh, really? You took it that way?

608
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,780
You keep thinking like that.

609
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,920
One day she will tie Rakhi to you too.

610
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,160
Everything will get over then.

611
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,020
Confess to her if you love her.

612
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:22,140
If will look ugly if the girl
you loved ties rakhi to you.

613
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:25,420
If you are scared then tell me,
I will talk to her.

614
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,420
Don't do anything stupid.

615
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:29,479
I will confess to her.

616
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:32,680
How can we know what
Nandu's been thinking about me?

617
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,220
How long will you hold it?

618
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:36,600
You think girls express by
themselves if they love someone?

619
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:40,900
They just give you signals
by winking or smiling at you.

620
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,460
We have to understand by that.

621
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:47,120
Dude!
-Yes.

622
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:48,440
Your lover is coming this way.

623
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:50,280
Must be to tie Rakhi to you.

624
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:51,259
We are dead.

625
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:52,480
Wait, I'm coming.

626
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:57,860
She has gone.

627
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:59,299
You think she saw us?

628
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:00,180
She went off.

629
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,660
She didn't notice us.
We are safe.

630
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:05,160
You get it?
We are afraid to even face her?

631
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,980
How can we approach her and propose?

632
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:10,460
But still,
why am I scared to see her?

633
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:13,279
Dude, this time I won't be
scared to face her. It's a challenge.

634
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:23,620
I've been observing you.

635
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:28,939
I heard that you are spreading rumors on me?

636
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,340
Me? No, not at all.

637
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:34,500
You picked up that fight for me?

638
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:36,240
No.

639
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:39,320
Then why are you running off from me?

640
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,960
Why are you afraid of me?

641
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,840
I'm not afraid.

642
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:44,200
Remember one thing.

643
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:47,720
Cowards should not desire anything,
be it girl or anything.

644
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:50,340
To be harsh, you shouldn't be
afraid even though it is.

645
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:51,819
Okay.

646
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:53,940
Tell me if there's something.

647
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:55,600
Don't worry about the consequence.

648
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:59,020
But if you lay back in fear,
you won't achieve anything.

649
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:02,960
If you're afraid to confess directly
then you can do it over phone call.

650
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:52,340
We must find her land phone number.

651
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:57,780
Score is 30.

652
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:59,300
No brother, it's 26.

653
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:02,480
Don't lie. How much two sixes
and one four add up to? Not 30?

654
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,120
You are lying.

655
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:07,040
How much 22 plus 4 is? Not 26?

656
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:09,319
Alright! Throw the ball now, I will hit six.

657
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:17,140
Oh God! What does he eat everyday?

658
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,540
That kid is coming towards us.

659
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:28,920
Don't leave her without knowing the number.

660
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:30,580
See my talent now.

661
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:33,740
Hey, look there!

662
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:35,520
Ask her.

663
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:36,380
You want the ball?

664
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:37,660
Do you have it?

665
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:40,320
No. But why is your brother saying
that you are weak at calculations?

666
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:42,020
I'm good at it than him.

667
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:45,319
If so then I'll put a test.
If you pass in it then I'll buy you a new ball.

668
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:46,680
What's it?

669
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:49,260
So, you're good at mathematics?
-Yes.

670
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:51,600
So, you remember everything?
-Yes, ask me.

671
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:53,560
Alright! How much is one plus one?

672
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:56,420
Hey, dumb! You think I'm in Kindergarten?

673
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:57,780
Ask me tough questions.

674
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:01,360
How many balls
does an over consist?
-Six.

675
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:05,520
How much did your
brother score in 1st over?

676
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:06,220
Ten.

677
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:08,220
Who all does carry
phones in your home?

678
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:12,120
My uncle and father have one each.
My mother has a landline.

679
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:14,600
Do you remember landline's number?
-I do.

680
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:15,520
Tell me once.

681
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:18,300
I shouldn't say it.
There are girls in the home.

682
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:20,040
You think of calling us?

683
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:21,820
I don't need your ball.

684
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:25,759
What the heck?

685
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:28,480
Brother, I couldn't find the ball.
Go search it.

686
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:31,060
That fat guy is coming here.

687
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:32,480
I cannot handle this.

688
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,040
Wait! I'll take care of him.

689
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:35,820
Ask him.

690
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:38,020
What are you searching for?

691
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,620
Brother! I lost my ball.

692
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:44,140
Stop searching for it.
Tell me something. I'll buy you a new one.

693
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:48,900
Just back you sister has said to me that you are
poor at mathematics and cannot remember anything.

694
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:50,980
Stupid girl! She doesn't remember anything.

695
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:53,900
So, you remember everything then?
-Yes, everything.

696
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:56,379
Even telephone numbers too?
-Yes.

697
00:43:56,460 --> 00:43:58,200
If so then tell me your uncle's phone number.

698
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:05,520
What about landline?

699
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:12,460
How insane!

700
00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:13,180
They got it.

701
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:14,340
I wrote everything.

702
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:15,160
Let's go.

703
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,940
Is this ball yours?
-Yes.

704
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:18,420
Take it.

705
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:20,320
Bye.
-Bye.

706
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:23,420
Hello, you promised me to buy a new one?

707
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:25,220
You already have one.
Why do you need new ball?

708
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:25,940
Get lost.

709
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:28,600
One day will be mine.
I will take revenge then.

710
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:31,120
What will you speak
to him if they call you?

711
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:33,040
Will think about it. Let's go.

712
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:34,660
I love you!

713
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:37,899
I love you!

714
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:40,240
Worst!

715
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:42,279
You are behaving like a rogue.
-What happened?

716
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:44,680
Does this way seems awkward?

717
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:46,859
You wish to say
'I love You' as the first thing in phone?

718
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:50,040
She asked me confess over phone
if I'm afraid to confront in person.

719
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:50,819
What else can we do?

720
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,360
That's not how you deal it.
-Then?

721
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:55,600
That is a landline, not a cellphone.

722
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:58,880
If someone else lifts
the phone then we are dead.

723
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:03,680
First see who took up
the call and then proceed.

724
00:45:04,180 --> 00:45:09,000
If your girl lifts the call then see
what she had to say and then confess.

725
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:14,100
You are afraid to talk to her directly.
At least dare to talk over phone.

726
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:21,180
Hey, keep your superstitions aside.

727
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:22,860
Our main priest has returned.

728
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:25,320
Go and seek his advice.

729
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:29,240
If I had a lover who encouraged like this,
I would have confessed in person.

730
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:30,460
Call her first.

731
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:36,680
Even I don't mind all such things.

732
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:40,220
But for marriage...
-You're repeating the same?

733
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:51,120
Hello! Who is that?

734
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:52,260
Who is speaking?

735
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:53,460
Shit!

736
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,860
I don't believe all those.

737
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:00,780
Will you ask him or should I?

738
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:02,640
I will speak to him.
-Okay.

739
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:04,380
Inform about it tomorrow.

740
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:11,900
Dear, I adviced you to eat well.
Are you following it?

741
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:14,500
God knows how you eat.

742
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:29,279
Call her this time.

743
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:30,660
Call now.

744
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:34,860
It's ringing. Lift the call.

745
00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:41,959
Speak up.

746
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:45,840
Confess her quickly.

747
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:47,480
What a coward!
-Tell her.

748
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:51,420
I found your phone number.

749
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:54,940
You told me to confess over phone.

750
00:46:55,660 --> 00:46:57,660
You wanted to say something, I guess.

751
00:46:58,460 --> 00:46:59,740
What's it?

752
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:02,640
Tell it.
-Tell it.

753
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:03,920
Don't waste time.

754
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:05,700
Tell her.
-I love you.

755
00:47:09,380 --> 00:47:10,000
What happened?

756
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:12,660
She hung up the call.
-Really?

757
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:14,000
Yes.

758
00:47:14,740 --> 00:47:16,319
It's all because of you.

759
00:47:16,540 --> 00:47:18,620
I tried to help you.

760
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:21,440
We will get to know once
we see her face tomorrow.

761
00:47:21,620 --> 00:47:23,200
We cannot understand these girls.

762
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:25,960
Does someone propose
on their first call itself?

763
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:27,520
Enough!

764
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:30,240
You forced me to confess and
now you're turning a blind eye?

765
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:30,840
Wait!

766
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:32,040
You do what I say?

767
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:35,300
Did you lose your brain like me?
-Why did you give me brainless ideas?

768
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:37,160
You must express your love.

769
00:47:38,580 --> 00:47:40,060
You said her face tells everything?

770
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:41,140
There's nothing to understand.

771
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:42,600
She didn't even see us.

772
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,820
Faces of women have different meanings.

773
00:47:46,020 --> 00:47:47,120
Let's go.

774
00:47:49,060 --> 00:47:49,680
She's coming.

775
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:51,460
See keenly.
You might understand something.

776
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:53,700
We cannot decipher.

777
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:56,879
Have you seen the film 'Idiot'?
-I've watched it 12 times.

778
00:47:57,360 --> 00:47:58,960
Do you remember the
famous dialogue from it?

779
00:47:59,080 --> 00:47:59,700
What's it?

780
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:02,319
The scene where Ravi Teja asks heroine.

781
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:04,620
Asked what?

782
00:48:04,940 --> 00:48:06,740
The scene where he asks,
"Suchi! What have you decided?"

783
00:48:06,740 --> 00:48:10,779
Meanwhile lecturer intervenes and
asks the hero,"What did you ask?"

784
00:48:10,780 --> 00:48:12,400
By the way,
what are you talking mister?

785
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:13,620
I didn't see you coming, sir.

786
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:15,620
Took me as attender?

787
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:16,860
Called me, sir?

788
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:19,980
Hey, get lost.

789
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:25,600
Hey, you always take such films as inspiration,

790
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:29,879
but have you ever taken films like Swayam Krushi as inspiration?

791
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:32,640
Dear boys, I've to say something.

792
00:48:34,220 --> 00:48:44,100
If you focus on girls now,
their beloved people start chasing you to beat.

793
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:48,420
Rather, if you get yourself a high paid job,

794
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:56,040
more better girls and their
families will fall at you to marry their daughter.

795
00:48:56,620 --> 00:48:58,299
Know the value of men, idiots.

796
00:48:58,620 --> 00:48:58,940
Sit down.

797
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:02,420
Everyone feels themselves as
heroes in front of girls.

798
00:49:02,420 --> 00:49:04,340
But everyone fails to answer
even to a simple question.

799
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:05,120
Idiots!

800
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:06,440
Hey you, get up!

801
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:08,220
Tell me the formula for (A+B)^2.

802
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:09,900
I love you.

803
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:18,100
Where to?

804
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:19,240
He got hurt.

805
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:26,299
Are you mad?
Why are you confusing him?

806
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:27,960
Tell him directly if you like him.

807
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:29,780
Don't waste time.

808
00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:31,700
Chandu cannot dare to propose you.

809
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:34,259
You yourself confess to him.

810
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:38,940
Don't mind it, dude.

811
00:49:39,140 --> 00:49:40,600
Want Samosa?
-No!

812
00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:48,020
Give two samosas.

813
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:58,640
Divya! Do early morning dreams come true?

814
00:49:59,060 --> 00:50:01,180
I guess so. Are you getting any dreams?

815
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:04,060
Sit down! Wait.

816
00:50:04,660 --> 00:50:05,540
Will listen to them.

817
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:07,379
Yes.

818
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:09,680
Recently, I'm getting
the same dream everyday.

819
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:11,900
Really? What is it?

820
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:18,920
It's that on my birthday,
some guy in white dress

821
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:25,240
is coming on horse to our ground
 and proposing me with a rose.

822
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:30,400
You think my dream would come true?

823
00:50:30,580 --> 00:50:33,500
Wait till your birthday.
Will see what happens.

824
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:35,200
By the way, when is your birthday?

825
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:36,600
It's tomorrow.

826
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:38,960
So your waiting will come to end then.

827
00:50:41,980 --> 00:50:45,660
Let's see whether your
dream comes true tomorrow.

828
00:51:55,640 --> 00:52:00,420
"Our hearts have synced."

829
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:04,620
"The love between them has flourished."

830
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:16,160
"We are the love birds that
are dwelling in their fondness."

831
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:25,720
"Here is a love couple running
hastily for no reason."

832
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:36,080
"Here is a love couple running in haze."

833
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:11,940
"Desperation to meet."

834
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:14,580
"Hesitations come uninvited."

835
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:19,540
"This love doesn't need
any introduction."

836
00:53:19,540 --> 00:53:22,180
"Mornings are full of joys."

837
00:53:22,180 --> 00:53:24,640
"Worries lay in the evenings."

838
00:53:24,860 --> 00:53:29,300
"The moment we part,
my mind muddles."

839
00:53:29,420 --> 00:53:31,900
"To bless our love..."

840
00:53:31,900 --> 00:53:39,060
"Let's ask the Gods to prosper
our love for years to come."

841
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:44,800
"My love springs at first light..."

842
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:47,300
"My heart starts to throb for you..."

843
00:54:47,540 --> 00:54:51,600
"I feel to be beside you every time."

844
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:55,060
"A small mistake surrounds the mind."

845
00:54:55,060 --> 00:54:57,520
"It worries about you."

846
00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:02,460
"I feel like sharing
every matter with you."

847
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:07,380
"Dear, I promise you
that I will be with you forever."

848
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:12,140
"My love is the witness for it."

849
00:55:12,820 --> 00:55:22,440
"Here is a love couple running
hastily for no reason."

850
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:32,660
"Here is a love couple running in haze."

851
00:55:45,940 --> 00:55:48,140
How much of the profit you made this year?

852
00:55:48,140 --> 00:55:49,779
Without rains we cannot expect it.

853
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:52,740
Greetings Rao, sir!
-Greetings!

854
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:55,000
Why is this beard man coming this way?

855
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:58,760
Are you for hire?
-Where to, uncle?

856
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:00,960
You seem elder than me
and calling me as uncle?

857
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:03,560
Sorry for that. Where to?
-To temple.

858
00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:09,200
Oh, the main priest.
I shouldn't run to him.

859
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:10,700
I should manage somehow to escape.

860
00:56:10,740 --> 00:56:12,379
Hope this beard man doesn't notice him.

861
00:56:12,380 --> 00:56:13,660
He seems like the priest.

862
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:14,980
Sir!

863
00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:16,140
Hey, stop the auto.

864
00:56:16,140 --> 00:56:17,540
Temple is far ahead, sir.

865
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:19,400
Cannot you hear? Stop the auto.

866
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:21,240
Roads are unwell, sir.
I will stop in the front.

867
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:21,819
Stop the auto.

868
00:56:21,820 --> 00:56:23,560
I will stop at a few distance, sir.
-Sir, wait.

869
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:24,200
We are doomed now.

870
00:56:24,580 --> 00:56:27,480
Sir! Greetings to you!

871
00:56:28,060 --> 00:56:30,140
Sir, how are you?
Everyone's doing well?

872
00:56:30,380 --> 00:56:31,920
Father, I've to go to toilet. Let's go.

873
00:56:33,220 --> 00:56:35,459
Wait! You were alright till now.

874
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:37,260
Father, I feel like shitting here.

875
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:38,860
You went to shit twice in the morning.

876
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:40,340
Why are you getting it now again?

877
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:41,320
Let him go.

878
00:56:41,420 --> 00:56:43,220
He keeps irritating me.
You tell me the matter.

879
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:17,400
You want to kill us?

880
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:19,720
Chandu, come fast.
-What happened?

881
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:22,000
Will you not attend college today?
-Leave it. First, come with me.

882
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,360
What happened?

883
00:57:23,820 --> 00:57:25,060
Where is Nandu?
-She is there.

884
00:57:25,740 --> 00:57:27,220
Nandu, come with me. It's urgent.

885
00:57:27,220 --> 00:57:28,899
What happened? Come where?
-First, come with me.

886
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:29,900
I'll tell you. Get in.

887
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,340
Has he gone insane?

888
00:57:32,340 --> 00:57:34,220
What happened?
Tell us.

889
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:35,620
Where are you taking us?

890
00:57:49,460 --> 00:57:50,660
What shall we do now?

891
00:57:51,140 --> 00:57:53,660
You don't get any better chance.

892
00:57:54,180 --> 00:57:57,540
Without thinking much,
just take her to somewhere and live happily.

893
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:01,720
My parents would make
me drop my studies if I go home now.

894
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:04,540
They would speed up my marriage.

895
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:06,220
I'm scared, Chandu.

896
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:08,299
Let's go somewhere.

897
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:13,560
I feel it's correct to take her away.

898
00:58:14,180 --> 00:58:16,180
If you leave her
then you will miss her forever.

899
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:19,340
First, we must think of a place to stay.

900
00:58:19,580 --> 00:58:24,740
I know a friend in Karimnagar.
You reach there, I will inform him.

901
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:27,460
There are my relatives in Karimnagar.

902
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:28,660
Let's not go there.

903
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:32,740
Then Hyderabad is safe.
None can identify you.

904
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:37,180
Don't worry about money.
I've Rs.20,000. I will get them.

905
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:39,360
Then hurry up now!

906
00:58:40,380 --> 00:58:41,060
Hey, come!

907
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:44,440
You seem like a buffoon,
but you're kind.

908
00:58:44,660 --> 00:58:45,379
You love me, right?

909
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:47,160
We are the next couple.
Be ready to run away.

910
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:49,500
I will kill you.
\Shut up and drive.

911
00:58:49,540 --> 00:58:50,540
Then stop praising me!

912
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:53,780
Wait! I'll be back.

913
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:05,560
Someone might identify us
 if we stand here.

914
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:07,419
Shall we sit somewhere hidden?

915
00:59:10,540 --> 00:59:11,620
We can sit there.

916
00:59:11,980 --> 00:59:12,500
Come!

917
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:14,380
I will not come.

918
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:16,740
There's no one.
I'm afraid.

919
00:59:17,260 --> 00:59:18,320
Don't fear for everything.

920
00:59:18,780 --> 00:59:19,220
Come!

921
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:20,540
No.

922
00:59:20,620 --> 00:59:21,640
It's okay, come.

923
00:59:22,060 --> 00:59:23,940
I'm scared.
-I'll take care.

924
01:00:01,420 --> 01:00:03,080
Hey! Hey!

925
01:00:04,060 --> 01:00:05,360
Chandu, no!

926
01:00:13,700 --> 01:00:14,520
Don't do anything.

927
01:00:14,700 --> 01:00:16,220
Who are you?
Please, stop it.

928
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:17,480
Chandu!

929
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:24,400
Drag her!

930
01:00:25,020 --> 01:00:25,640
No!

931
01:00:27,620 --> 01:00:28,279
No!

932
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:37,360
Save me!

933
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:50,520
No!

934
01:00:53,620 --> 01:00:54,859
Help me!

935
01:00:57,740 --> 01:00:58,879
What happened?

936
01:00:58,880 --> 01:00:59,680
Nandu, sir!

937
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:09,900
We were patrolling there,
so we rescued her.

938
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:37,020
Father, please!

939
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:45,520
Enough now!

940
01:01:46,460 --> 01:01:48,040
This is Police station,
not your home.

941
01:01:49,100 --> 01:01:51,140
Take care of such things at home.

942
01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:59,740
I warned you that he would
become vagrant like his mother.

943
01:02:01,720 --> 01:02:05,500
He rebukes at me
for scolding him.

944
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:08,400
You were elated to
marry your daughter to him.

945
01:02:09,300 --> 01:02:11,120
Now, tell me what you want to do.

946
01:02:11,320 --> 01:02:15,720
Ugly punk! None would come forward to
marry my daughter after seeing him in my home.

947
01:02:18,380 --> 01:02:21,100
Decide whether I
should stay or him.

948
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:22,720
Tell me what you decide.

949
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:29,240
Father, forgive him for this time.

950
01:02:29,780 --> 01:02:31,340
Get out of my home.

951
01:02:31,340 --> 01:02:34,080
I will kill you if you come near.

952
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:36,580
Disobedient dog! Get lost!

953
01:02:39,640 --> 01:02:42,240
People are afraid of having
daughters because of persons like you.

954
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:45,020
I wouldn't have these torments
if I had killed you at birth.

955
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:46,299
What is my sin?

956
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:49,160
Your brother and you
have ruined me.

957
01:02:50,740 --> 01:02:53,000
Stop showing
your masculinity.

958
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:55,720
You killed our son earlier
and you want to kill her too?

959
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:04,280
I will kill you both.

960
01:03:07,900 --> 01:03:09,420
You are spoiling
my reputation.

961
01:03:09,580 --> 01:03:11,840
Stop it, brother-in-law!
-Don't stop me. Leave!

962
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:13,900
Control your anger.
I will speak to them.

963
01:03:13,900 --> 01:03:14,940
What will you speak?

964
01:03:15,040 --> 01:03:16,500
Leave me! I will kill them today.

965
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:18,840
You want to be alone after killing everyone?

966
01:03:20,080 --> 01:03:21,620
Wait! I'll speak to them.

967
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:23,980
It's not good to
waste any time further.

968
01:03:24,460 --> 01:03:26,080
We have to conduct
 their marriage in two days.

969
01:03:28,260 --> 01:03:29,580
I'll look after the arrangements.

970
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:33,140
Don't think of anything. Be calm.

971
01:03:34,360 --> 01:03:35,920
Till then the girl stays in my home.

972
01:03:39,140 --> 01:03:40,620
Come, sister. Bring her.

973
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:14,320
Are you mad?
What's need for love at this age?

974
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:21,540
Infatuations are common.

975
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:24,500
Don't spoil your
lives by calling it as love.

976
01:04:27,160 --> 01:04:28,339
You are a topper.

977
01:04:28,900 --> 01:04:31,560
You can get more
better girls than Nandu.

978
01:04:32,260 --> 01:04:33,940
I don't have anyone except Nandu.

979
01:04:34,340 --> 01:04:36,400
I studied well only for her.

980
01:04:36,940 --> 01:04:40,320
If I lose her then for
whom should I become great?

981
01:04:45,780 --> 01:04:49,180
Does Nandu trust
you as much as you do?

982
01:04:49,540 --> 01:04:50,540
Yes, sir.

983
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:54,820
Will she sacrifice everything and come for you?
-Definitely, sir.

984
01:04:56,620 --> 01:04:59,740
Do you guarantee that you
both won't part amid atrocities?

985
01:05:00,840 --> 01:05:01,480
I do, sir.

986
01:05:03,020 --> 01:05:06,900
Do you believe that you could take good care of her?
-Yes, sir.

987
01:05:10,120 --> 01:05:12,240
So, you want her at any cost?

988
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:13,440
Yes, sir.

989
01:05:16,340 --> 01:05:18,420
Then I can help you to some extent.

990
01:05:19,740 --> 01:05:21,700
I will tell you the plan
and you work it out.

991
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:23,520
Later, figure it out yourselves.

992
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:17,060
The Police have come.

993
01:06:17,120 --> 01:06:17,540
Hey!

994
01:06:18,860 --> 01:06:20,180
Stop eating here.

995
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:24,740
They are from Women welfare association.

996
01:06:24,980 --> 01:06:26,560
Why have you come here?

997
01:06:26,820 --> 01:06:29,520
We received a complaint that bride is minor.
Stop the marriage.

998
01:06:31,020 --> 01:06:32,340
Who said that she is a minor?

999
01:06:32,340 --> 01:06:33,740
She just turned 18 recently.

1000
01:06:33,740 --> 01:06:36,759
We have come after verifying
her certificates in the college.

1001
01:06:36,900 --> 01:06:41,020
She is our girl.
We will do as we wish.

1002
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:45,220
For my marriage, I was 17 and she was 12.
Aren't we happy now?

1003
01:06:45,320 --> 01:06:49,460
Sir, you're a reputed man.
Understand the issue here.

1004
01:06:49,820 --> 01:06:52,200
You think we would stop the
marriage if you bring an association?

1005
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:53,880
Hey, send them away.

1006
01:06:55,660 --> 01:06:58,500
Are these the hands
of a man who does rowdyism?

1007
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:00,600
My hands are rough than yours.

1008
01:07:02,320 --> 01:07:04,060
My name is Tees Maar Khan.

1009
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:06,180
Do you understand me?

1010
01:07:06,780 --> 01:07:09,840
I will cut off the hands
of those who try to stop us.

1011
01:07:10,100 --> 01:07:12,560
Uncle, sister is running
away from that side.

1012
01:07:17,560 --> 01:07:19,299
Leave me, they are running away.

1013
01:07:19,300 --> 01:07:20,000
Hey!

1014
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:25,540
What are you staring at?
Go, catch them.

1015
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:34,620
Why did you kill the engine?
-It got turned off by itself.

1016
01:07:34,780 --> 01:07:35,420
Hurry up!

1017
01:07:36,440 --> 01:07:37,860
They are running away in auto.

1018
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:40,880
They are approaching.
Start it quickly.

1019
01:07:41,060 --> 01:07:42,220
Start this tottering vehicle.

1020
01:07:42,220 --> 01:07:43,379
Move now!
-Make it quick!

1021
01:07:43,380 --> 01:07:45,380
Go, now!
-It started, drive now.

1022
01:07:45,700 --> 01:07:47,839
If they catch us,
they will kill us.

1023
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:48,760
Drive faster.

1024
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:50,460
Brother, they are escaping.

1025
01:07:51,840 --> 01:07:52,960
Take the car.

1026
01:07:53,180 --> 01:07:55,100
They can't go much far in auto.

1027
01:07:55,300 --> 01:07:56,160
Get in quickly.

1028
01:07:56,460 --> 01:07:58,460
We must catch them
before they cross the village.

1029
01:07:59,140 --> 01:08:00,299
Start the vehicle.

1030
01:08:02,460 --> 01:08:03,880
Sir, they deflated the tyres.

1031
01:08:06,180 --> 01:08:06,720
Deflated?

1032
01:08:07,620 --> 01:08:08,020
Shit!

1033
01:08:08,100 --> 01:08:09,620
I must blame these fellows first.

1034
01:08:10,060 --> 01:08:13,360
You check age for
marriage alone? Not for love?

1035
01:08:15,180 --> 01:08:17,620
Hey Tees Maar Khan,
will you bring back my girl

1036
01:08:17,680 --> 01:08:19,760
or should I complain to the
Minister that you let them escape?

1037
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:20,560
Bring the vehicle.

1038
01:08:21,319 --> 01:08:22,700
Sir, even our vehicle tyres are deflated.

1039
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:26,840
Hello, Control room?

1040
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:30,380
It seems like they are
sending us off to get married.

1041
01:08:30,380 --> 01:08:31,420
Why anyone isn't following us?

1042
01:08:31,420 --> 01:08:33,440
Because I have
deflated their vehicle tyres.

1043
01:08:33,720 --> 01:08:34,720
You're great, man.

1044
01:08:35,740 --> 01:08:37,660
Is this the short cut way to Hyderabad?

1045
01:08:37,819 --> 01:08:39,219
He must know.

1046
01:08:39,700 --> 01:08:40,800
Where are we going?

1047
01:08:41,260 --> 01:08:44,500
Stop worrying. It's my responsibility
to get you to Hyderabad safely.

1048
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:46,640
To Hyderabad, in auto?

1049
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:47,859
Not in auto.

1050
01:08:48,100 --> 01:08:49,440
We will park it here
and walk by forest.

1051
01:08:49,700 --> 01:08:52,160
Won't forest animals hunt us?

1052
01:08:52,160 --> 01:08:53,460
They don't hunt lovers.

1053
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:55,780
It's forest all around.
How do we get out of here?

1054
01:08:55,779 --> 01:08:57,179
I know the way. Get down.

1055
01:08:58,140 --> 01:08:59,080
Where did you bring us?

1056
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:00,700
The Police must be on the way.

1057
01:09:00,700 --> 01:09:02,960
They may be Police,
but I'm more smart than them.

1058
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:04,279
I know how to mislead them.

1059
01:09:08,500 --> 01:09:10,520
I've kept Rs.20,000 in the bag.

1060
01:09:10,760 --> 01:09:13,040
These would do for your expenses.

1061
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:14,420
Take off your ornaments and give me.

1062
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:15,520
Make it fast.

1063
01:09:22,260 --> 01:09:24,380
What are you
going to do with them?

1064
01:09:24,380 --> 01:09:25,220
Wait!

1065
01:09:25,680 --> 01:09:26,640
What are you up to?

1066
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:27,360
Answer us.

1067
01:09:27,359 --> 01:09:29,319
He seems to make us get caught.

1068
01:09:29,439 --> 01:09:31,099
Hey!
-Why are you placing them there?

1069
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:34,760
You know what you're doing?

1070
01:09:34,899 --> 01:09:37,559
We must run that way.

1071
01:09:37,899 --> 01:09:40,399
When Police arrive,
they think we went this way.

1072
01:09:41,020 --> 01:09:42,500
What a brain!

1073
01:09:42,859 --> 01:09:43,759
Thank you!

1074
01:09:44,040 --> 01:09:45,500
Alright! Let's go.

1075
01:09:45,979 --> 01:09:46,740
Take the bag.

1076
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:48,520
I'll bring it.
-Let's go.

1077
01:09:49,260 --> 01:09:50,800
Nandu, careful! There are thorns.

1078
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:52,720
Chandu, something stuck to my saree.

1079
01:09:52,840 --> 01:09:53,400
I will remove it.

1080
01:09:53,460 --> 01:09:54,880
Careful! Hurry up!
-Come fast.

1081
01:09:58,460 --> 01:09:59,560
Sir, there is the auto.

1082
01:10:00,680 --> 01:10:02,100
Come fast.
We can catch them.

1083
01:10:02,100 --> 01:10:04,420
Where can they escape to?

1084
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:07,080
It's empty.

1085
01:10:08,460 --> 01:10:08,900
What's that?

1086
01:10:09,940 --> 01:10:13,259
Sir, they stopped the
 auto her and ran that way.

1087
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:15,519
Sir, the flowered hair is here.

1088
01:10:15,900 --> 01:10:17,219
Those must have fallen while running.

1089
01:10:18,260 --> 01:10:21,540
They had ignored
these and ran.

1090
01:10:21,940 --> 01:10:23,200
You go that way,
I'll take this way.

1091
01:10:24,180 --> 01:10:25,920
Who could have taken this way?

1092
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:27,940
Stop searching.
Wait for a minute.

1093
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:30,980
Sir, come fast.
They might escape.

1094
01:10:31,460 --> 01:10:34,660
Stop using brain.
It's harmful for the society.

1095
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:38,140
Got it? Wait and follow me.

1096
01:10:38,920 --> 01:10:42,240
He should be named after
 Useless Khan rather Tees Maar Khan.

1097
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:44,140
He's posing like searching something.

1098
01:11:04,580 --> 01:11:07,019
They are not
dumb but you are.

1099
01:11:07,420 --> 01:11:11,300
To mislead us, they placed
those there and ran off this way.

1100
01:11:16,760 --> 01:11:18,460
It's all forest everywhere.

1101
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:20,600
Chandu, I'm scared.

1102
01:11:21,680 --> 01:11:23,600
You should have
that fear while falling in love.

1103
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:24,240
Walk now!

1104
01:11:24,340 --> 01:11:25,440
Bloody age-barred guy!

1105
01:11:26,220 --> 01:11:27,000
Come on, sir.

1106
01:11:27,420 --> 01:11:30,120
Hey, why are you speeding up?

1107
01:11:30,520 --> 01:11:33,560
Because of late action,
you delay catching terrorists.

1108
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:35,220
Searching needs quick action.

1109
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:37,360
Hey idiot, this is Adilabad forest.

1110
01:11:37,540 --> 01:11:39,040
This is Kawal Wildlife Sanctuary.

1111
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:42,260
Wild animals live here.

1112
01:11:43,740 --> 01:11:46,179
Just recently, it was declared as Tiger zone.

1113
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:47,440
What is Tiger zone?

1114
01:11:47,640 --> 01:11:49,360
This is Tigers spot.

1115
01:11:51,720 --> 01:11:53,740
Recently, they released 45 tigers here.

1116
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:56,120
Oh God! I'm scared of tigers, sir.

1117
01:11:56,620 --> 01:12:00,599
Bloody youth! They don't care
anything except loving.

1118
01:12:01,100 --> 01:12:03,080
They risked their lives for love.

1119
01:12:03,240 --> 01:12:04,679
Why should we die?

1120
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:08,840
Sir, we must stay together and search.
-First, move aside.

1121
01:12:10,460 --> 01:12:11,000
Come slowly.

1122
01:12:12,620 --> 01:12:14,540
Chandu, this place is beautiful.

1123
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:15,980
Where did we come to?

1124
01:12:16,100 --> 01:12:18,680
This is called as Saptha Gundala Waterfall.

1125
01:12:18,760 --> 01:12:19,760
Really?
-Yes.

1126
01:12:20,040 --> 01:12:21,019
This is really spectacular.

1127
01:12:21,640 --> 01:12:23,500
Yet I didn't read about this anywhere.

1128
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:27,139
Come forward.

1129
01:12:27,700 --> 01:12:28,860
See, how beautiful it is.

1130
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:31,580
What's the way to
reach this place again?

1131
01:12:32,140 --> 01:12:33,420
There are no ways.

1132
01:12:33,780 --> 01:12:35,519
Someone like you should
lose their way to come here.

1133
01:12:36,140 --> 01:12:39,140
It appears as if we have come
for vacation rather to escape.

1134
01:12:39,700 --> 01:12:40,639
Wow!

1135
01:12:40,920 --> 01:12:42,640
Wow! What a mind bowing!

1136
01:12:42,840 --> 01:12:44,980
It's mind blowing, not bowing.

1137
01:12:45,260 --> 01:12:46,100
Whatever!

1138
01:12:46,520 --> 01:12:48,420
If we don't move,
the Police may find us.

1139
01:12:48,860 --> 01:12:50,080
Change the dress quickly
and come.

1140
01:12:50,580 --> 01:12:51,559
Go, hurry up!

1141
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:53,640
You stay here.
-Alright, go!

1142
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:01,540
You think the Police will find us?

1143
01:13:01,700 --> 01:13:03,840
My foot! They must have
taken the other way. Don't worry.

1144
01:13:03,940 --> 01:13:06,839
Chandu! Talk something. I'm scared.

1145
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:09,860
Hey, Police will find us with
her loud voice. Stop her!

1146
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:16,020
Chandu! I'm hungry.

1147
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:17,320
Even, I'm too.

1148
01:13:17,320 --> 01:13:18,320
Wait!

1149
01:13:19,260 --> 01:13:19,840
Take it.

1150
01:13:20,540 --> 01:13:20,960
Eat.

1151
01:13:24,020 --> 01:13:25,160
Where did you bring them from?

1152
01:13:25,160 --> 01:13:25,519
Eat!

1153
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:27,620
You know only of escaping.

1154
01:13:27,820 --> 01:13:29,740
Person like me thinks beyond that.

1155
01:13:29,940 --> 01:13:32,179
We must eat these and run fast.

1156
01:13:32,380 --> 01:13:33,740
Give me another one.
-Okay.

1157
01:13:34,300 --> 01:13:35,440
Sir, there they are.

1158
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:36,620
Dude, the Police have come.

1159
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:37,960
That bald head man came here too?

1160
01:13:37,960 --> 01:13:39,520
Catch them!
-Okay, sir.

1161
01:13:50,620 --> 01:13:52,620
How far the main road?

1162
01:13:52,720 --> 01:13:55,420
Not even half a kilometer.

1163
01:13:55,640 --> 01:13:57,180
There are trees all over.
-Careful!

1164
01:13:57,600 --> 01:13:59,480
There's no proper way to even run.

1165
01:13:59,480 --> 01:14:01,839
You think government
will lay roads for you?

1166
01:14:03,620 --> 01:14:04,400
My dress!

1167
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:05,120
What happened?

1168
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:06,500
What happened to dress?

1169
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:08,120
Something stuck to it and tore.

1170
01:14:09,100 --> 01:14:09,520
Dress?

1171
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:10,980
It's fine come.
-Let's go.

1172
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:12,140
Police are coming.

1173
01:14:12,140 --> 01:14:13,360
No, I've to change it.

1174
01:14:13,400 --> 01:14:14,240
Come!

1175
01:14:14,240 --> 01:14:15,360
Not the time to care it.

1176
01:14:15,700 --> 01:14:17,280
I've to change the dress first.

1177
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:18,259
Take this and go.

1178
01:14:23,540 --> 01:14:25,780
It's getting late. Call her.

1179
01:14:26,860 --> 01:14:28,099
Nandu, make it fast.

1180
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:30,000
Wait for sometime.

1181
01:14:30,660 --> 01:14:31,740
Still how much time?

1182
01:14:31,740 --> 01:14:33,400
Almost done. Coming.

1183
01:14:34,200 --> 01:14:36,800
These ladies always make late.

1184
01:14:37,020 --> 01:14:38,220
Come fast. The Police are coming.

1185
01:14:38,540 --> 01:14:40,760
I just can wear a short and come.

1186
01:14:40,980 --> 01:14:43,459
It doesn't matter
if you don't wear anything. -Stop it.

1187
01:14:44,660 --> 01:14:47,300
Tell her to hurry up. It seems
like you both would settle here.

1188
01:14:49,400 --> 01:14:51,519
May be. I like this place.

1189
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:53,520
Enough joking. Come quickly.

1190
01:14:54,180 --> 01:14:56,080
Chandu, shall we settle down here?

1191
01:14:56,280 --> 01:14:58,000
Don't irritate me. Come!

1192
01:15:01,100 --> 01:15:02,800
Chandu, you too come here.

1193
01:15:02,840 --> 01:15:03,620
Come where?

1194
01:15:03,960 --> 01:15:05,280
At least, you guys convince her.

1195
01:15:05,500 --> 01:15:08,100
I will sit here.
See, how beautiful it is.

1196
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:09,780
A swing!

1197
01:15:10,260 --> 01:15:11,720
Swing? You call it a swing?

1198
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:16,460
Dude, she has left the bag.

1199
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:18,480
Wait, I'll get it.

1200
01:15:19,420 --> 01:15:22,420
What sort of girlfriend
you've found to love!

1201
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:25,580
Bloody hell! Does falling in love
makes us do all these works?

1202
01:15:26,020 --> 01:15:27,200
I won't love anyone in life.

1203
01:15:27,540 --> 01:15:28,840
I don't need any girl or her love.

1204
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:31,800
Earlier, I used to get
feelings for every girl I see.

1205
01:15:32,120 --> 01:15:34,640
But, by experiencing all
these I lost all of them.

1206
01:15:34,980 --> 01:15:36,639
Catch it!
-Slowly!

1207
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:39,520
Got you! Sir, come here.

1208
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:42,540
Sir, I caught the girl.

1209
01:15:42,540 --> 01:15:45,380
Do something.
-Do something, man.

1210
01:15:45,380 --> 01:15:49,840
Tiger! Tiger! Tiger!

1211
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:51,300
Hey, fatty! Tiger is chasing.

1212
01:15:51,620 --> 01:15:53,059
Tiger! Tiger!

1213
01:15:56,440 --> 01:15:58,940
Tiger, sir!
-Tiger!

1214
01:16:01,940 --> 01:16:05,219
Tiger! Hey bald head, run faster!

1215
01:16:05,420 --> 01:16:07,740
Run faster!

1216
01:16:07,940 --> 01:16:09,559
Sir, tiger is chasing us.

1217
01:16:19,320 --> 01:16:20,500
Sir, I saw a tiger.

1218
01:16:24,700 --> 01:16:25,660
Where?

1219
01:16:27,140 --> 01:16:28,700
Just now, I saw it there, sir.

1220
01:16:28,940 --> 01:16:30,580
I myself, am a tiger.

1221
01:16:34,120 --> 01:16:36,080
Catch the tiger.
-Okay, sir.

1222
01:16:36,220 --> 01:16:37,680
Going, sir.
-There are three tigers.

1223
01:16:38,540 --> 01:16:40,000
Why didn't you go?

1224
01:16:40,660 --> 01:16:43,940
Sir, I fear tigers.
I will come with you.

1225
01:16:45,300 --> 01:16:46,340
Alright, come.

1226
01:16:46,500 --> 01:16:47,820
You help the lovers?

1227
01:16:48,660 --> 01:16:49,980
Run faster!

1228
01:16:49,980 --> 01:16:51,839
Chandu, Jaffar is not coming.

1229
01:16:51,940 --> 01:16:53,139
Jaffar!

1230
01:16:53,140 --> 01:16:55,820
He will come.
-Don't think of him. He'll come.

1231
01:17:11,480 --> 01:17:13,679
You got hurt?
-It's alright, you run.

1232
01:17:13,680 --> 01:17:16,560
There is a highway route near.
Go and catch a bus.

1233
01:17:16,940 --> 01:17:17,339
Go!

1234
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:20,680
Chandu, bag?
-Bag?

1235
01:17:21,380 --> 01:17:23,120
Chandu, police!
-Got him. Stop!

1236
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:25,360
Let's go!
-Your S.I. got a cardiac arrest.

1237
01:17:25,500 --> 01:17:27,320
Constables, come here quickly!

1238
01:17:27,440 --> 01:17:29,219
Our sir fell ill. Let's go.

1239
01:17:29,820 --> 01:17:32,280
You screamed to
let them hear, right?

1240
01:18:13,260 --> 01:18:14,840
Want to hop in?

1241
01:18:17,500 --> 01:18:18,660
Did you elope?

1242
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:24,540
Come, I will drop you on the road.

1243
01:18:30,520 --> 01:18:32,800
You seem like good lovers.

1244
01:18:34,860 --> 01:18:36,320
But, you are so young.

1245
01:18:38,040 --> 01:18:39,519
How do you plan to survive?

1246
01:18:42,940 --> 01:18:45,480
Dear, there's no need to fear.

1247
01:18:46,120 --> 01:18:47,480
Even I had a love-marriage.

1248
01:18:49,220 --> 01:18:52,840
I eloped like you and
faced a lot of problems.

1249
01:18:53,100 --> 01:18:54,480
I had overcome those bravely.

1250
01:18:54,920 --> 01:18:57,620
Now, I'm so happy
with my two children.

1251
01:19:00,020 --> 01:19:02,520
Dear, a risk taker will never fail.

1252
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:07,600
I have a friend named
Suleman in Hyderabad.

1253
01:19:07,860 --> 01:19:10,219
He will pick you up
when you get down there.

1254
01:19:10,740 --> 01:19:11,280
Okay.

1255
01:19:11,420 --> 01:19:15,480
You better get some sleep.
It takes time to cross the forest.

1256
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:33,320
Hello, dear!

1257
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:35,340
Wake up.
Road to Hyderabad has come.

1258
01:19:56,380 --> 01:19:57,080
No, don't!

1259
01:19:57,080 --> 01:19:58,660
It's alright, keep it.

1260
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:01,220
I feel like giving more.

1261
01:20:01,320 --> 01:20:02,679
But, I don't have much.

1262
01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:06,460
I did phone Suleman.
He will take care of your expenses.

1263
01:20:06,720 --> 01:20:09,260
I will stop Hyderabad bus,
you board it.

1264
01:21:04,360 --> 01:21:05,740
Sir, we reached
Hyderabad. Get down.

1265
01:21:09,400 --> 01:21:11,400
They didn't carry a bag even.

1266
01:21:21,440 --> 01:21:24,240
The lorry driver said that a
person, Suleman will pick us up?

1267
01:21:25,400 --> 01:21:26,360
How can we recognise him?

1268
01:21:34,620 --> 01:21:36,880
Hi! You are looking for me, right?

1269
01:21:38,100 --> 01:21:40,740
I'm Suleman. I'm
the guy you're searching for.

1270
01:21:42,420 --> 01:21:44,820
The lorry driver is my friend.

1271
01:21:46,520 --> 01:21:49,840
He told me to take care
of you. Come with me.

1272
01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:55,880
I've helped many lovers.

1273
01:21:56,060 --> 01:21:58,040
Lovers from every place
will come to me.

1274
01:21:58,440 --> 01:21:59,860
I'm there. Don't worry.

1275
01:22:00,220 --> 01:22:03,920
As soon my friend phoned me,
I searched a home for you to stay.

1276
01:22:04,060 --> 01:22:07,440
I've bought the essential
items from China bazaar.

1277
01:22:07,580 --> 01:22:09,380
I've searched a job for you.

1278
01:22:10,080 --> 01:22:11,100
The house is very near.

1279
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:12,960
We will
make your marriage.

1280
01:22:14,580 --> 01:22:16,380
I will settle your life. Come!

1281
01:22:21,700 --> 01:22:22,420
Come with me.

1282
01:22:30,380 --> 01:22:31,240
Any problem?

1283
01:22:33,480 --> 01:22:36,320
I alone have been talking.
Any problem?

1284
01:22:37,940 --> 01:22:40,540
We are not adults.

1285
01:22:41,180 --> 01:22:42,200
We don't need a room.

1286
01:22:42,620 --> 01:22:44,120
Please, search hostels for us.

1287
01:22:46,120 --> 01:22:48,660
Very mature thought
at such young age.

1288
01:22:49,240 --> 01:22:50,900
You both are very great.

1289
01:22:50,980 --> 01:22:52,160
Let's drop the room idea.

1290
01:22:52,240 --> 01:22:53,620
I like you both.

1291
01:22:53,860 --> 01:22:56,179
I will provide those to others.

1292
01:22:56,460 --> 01:22:56,860
Come!

1293
01:22:59,700 --> 01:23:00,960
Brother!

1294
01:23:01,240 --> 01:23:03,559
From where all these
people have come from?

1295
01:23:03,860 --> 01:23:05,240
Why there's much traffic here?

1296
01:23:05,240 --> 01:23:07,719
All love couples like
you came and settled here.

1297
01:23:11,280 --> 01:23:12,800
Shall we click a photo
in front of Charminar?

1298
01:23:14,120 --> 01:23:15,660
My friend's juice shop is over there.

1299
01:23:16,060 --> 01:23:19,000
I wonder what you have eaten.
Come let's eat.

1300
01:23:20,060 --> 01:23:21,840
Fruit salad is famous here.

1301
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:23,220
It's called as Tin fruit salad.

1302
01:23:23,480 --> 01:23:24,160
It will be tasty.

1303
01:23:24,360 --> 01:23:26,780
Give me three fruit salad.

1304
01:23:31,880 --> 01:23:32,440
Sit here!

1305
01:23:40,480 --> 01:23:41,139
Tasty, right?

1306
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:49,500
We don't know when we
will visit Charminar again.

1307
01:23:52,420 --> 01:23:53,160
Let's do one thing.

1308
01:23:55,240 --> 01:23:56,840
Shall we see Charminar inside?

1309
01:23:59,040 --> 01:24:00,600
It will be beautiful inside.

1310
01:24:02,540 --> 01:24:03,140
Do one thing.

1311
01:24:04,500 --> 01:24:09,640
We both will come after eating.
You go and buy tickets for us.

1312
01:24:14,780 --> 01:24:15,300
Okay.

1313
01:24:46,240 --> 01:24:49,800
Where did they go?
-They have gone. Get lost!

1314
01:25:13,560 --> 01:25:15,660
Forget kids,
even youngsters are missing.

1315
01:25:15,660 --> 01:25:19,480
This is Hyderabad.
Anyone can get sold off.

1316
01:25:29,400 --> 01:25:30,240
Hey, sit down!

1317
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:32,219
Where are you going?
-Sit down!

1318
01:25:32,440 --> 01:25:33,580
Sit down!
-Leave me!

1319
01:25:38,600 --> 01:25:41,300
Brother! Where are we?

1320
01:25:42,900 --> 01:25:43,940
Who are they?

1321
01:25:46,220 --> 01:25:48,340
I'm scared. Let's go.

1322
01:25:54,040 --> 01:25:55,720
You have come
to the right place, dear.

1323
01:26:01,860 --> 01:26:04,019
You look like Miss India.

1324
01:26:04,020 --> 01:26:05,380
You are settled now.

1325
01:26:06,320 --> 01:26:07,280
One minute.

1326
01:26:08,600 --> 01:26:09,560
Yes, dear!

1327
01:26:11,820 --> 01:26:16,000
A new bird has just arrived.
She is still fresh.

1328
01:26:16,680 --> 01:26:18,780
There's no compromise in the rate.

1329
01:26:20,420 --> 01:26:23,460
I don't sell her for less
than five lakh rupees.

1330
01:26:25,300 --> 01:26:26,200
Bye!

1331
01:26:30,700 --> 01:26:32,160
Come dear!
-Brother!

1332
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:33,760
Leave me!

1333
01:26:35,160 --> 01:26:36,960
You don't cooperate like this.

1334
01:26:43,860 --> 01:26:44,940
Brother!

1335
01:26:46,380 --> 01:26:47,600
Hey, give me the belt.

1336
01:26:55,220 --> 01:26:58,220
Brother! Tell her
to stop beating me.

1337
01:26:59,300 --> 01:27:00,680
Who can stop me?

1338
01:27:01,300 --> 01:27:02,660
Take her inside.

1339
01:27:03,040 --> 01:27:04,980
Brother!

1340
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:20,660
The girl is gorgeous.

1341
01:27:21,880 --> 01:27:22,660
These aren't enough.

1342
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:24,260
I need Rs.50,000.

1343
01:27:24,380 --> 01:27:24,920
It's urgent.

1344
01:27:25,940 --> 01:27:27,179
You are still due to me.

1345
01:27:29,320 --> 01:27:31,719
I don't have money now.
I will give later.

1346
01:27:33,180 --> 01:27:34,560
My sister is in hospital.

1347
01:27:35,480 --> 01:27:37,980
Her condition is serious.
She needs a surgery,

1348
01:27:38,240 --> 01:27:40,160
Is it a surgery or abortion?

1349
01:27:40,720 --> 01:27:41,560
Mind your words!

1350
01:27:43,020 --> 01:27:44,680
You expect me to respect
 persons like you?

1351
01:27:45,660 --> 01:27:46,800
This has been your business.

1352
01:27:47,920 --> 01:27:49,920
I heard that you have
 started your own business?

1353
01:27:50,620 --> 01:27:52,340
Is that with your sister?

1354
01:27:52,460 --> 01:27:53,700
You're crossing your limits.

1355
01:27:54,080 --> 01:27:55,519
Give me my money.
I will go.

1356
01:27:55,640 --> 01:27:57,140
I don't have any.

1357
01:27:58,800 --> 01:28:00,560
Hello! Yes, dear.

1358
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:02,780
This new girl is too hot.

1359
01:28:03,480 --> 01:28:05,339
I'll share her pictures
 via whatsapp.

1360
01:28:05,820 --> 01:28:07,340
Pay me only
after seeing her.

1361
01:28:07,560 --> 01:28:10,540
I don't sell her for
less than five lakh rupees.

1362
01:28:11,540 --> 01:28:12,860
Hey, get lost!

1363
01:28:13,040 --> 01:28:15,000
Hey, I don't sell the girl.

1364
01:28:15,480 --> 01:28:18,599
Where will you go?
Take care of him.

1365
01:28:56,780 --> 01:29:13,380
"Dear love, though my dreams are tiring,
I kept my eyes open in search of you."

1366
01:29:14,060 --> 01:29:18,160
"Without you I am alone."

1367
01:29:18,160 --> 01:29:22,440
"I believed that we both are one."

1368
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:27,280
"I don't have anyone except you."

1369
01:29:27,280 --> 01:29:30,900
"I wished to be with you forever."

1370
01:29:31,500 --> 01:29:47,200
"Dear love, though my dreams are tiring,
I kept my eyes open in search of you."

1371
01:30:26,360 --> 01:30:30,559
"I see your image wherever I go."

1372
01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:34,480
"I hear you
smiling from every direction."

1373
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:38,940
"I'm fighting for you tirelessly."

1374
01:30:39,360 --> 01:30:43,320
"It's the God's will
to elate us or mock us."

1375
01:30:43,660 --> 01:30:51,860
"My past life sins have
parted us in the present life."

1376
01:30:52,440 --> 01:31:00,639
"My past life sins have
parted us in the present life."

1377
01:31:00,760 --> 01:31:17,960
"Dear love, though my dreams are tiring,
I kept my eyes open in search of you."

1378
01:31:42,360 --> 01:31:46,360
"I saw you as a gift
of my religious vow."

1379
01:31:46,660 --> 01:31:50,700
"I wished to walk with
you until our funeral."

1380
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:55,220
"I'm at my last breath for you, dear."

1381
01:31:55,340 --> 01:31:59,360
"This body, without you, will shut
for life."

1382
01:31:59,500 --> 01:32:07,740
"The almighty God will obtain
virtuousness if he unites us."

1383
01:32:08,420 --> 01:32:16,500
"The almighty God will obtain
virtuousness if he unites us."

1384
01:32:16,660 --> 01:32:33,460
"Dear love, though my dreams are tiring,
I kept my eyes open in search of you."

1385
01:33:41,560 --> 01:33:42,660
Call their parents.

1386
01:33:43,700 --> 01:33:44,160
Sit down!

1387
01:33:51,740 --> 01:33:52,639
Hey!

1388
01:33:53,340 --> 01:33:56,120
How dare you cheat me after
trusting you all these years?

1389
01:33:56,120 --> 01:33:56,940
Move!

1390
01:33:56,940 --> 01:33:58,480
You are dead now.

1391
01:33:58,480 --> 01:34:00,080
Wait there!

1392
01:34:00,080 --> 01:34:02,100
Get lost, you broker!

1393
01:34:02,100 --> 01:34:04,300
Even Police are my regular customers.
- I will rip you off!

1394
01:34:04,300 --> 01:34:07,420
I will see your end here.
-Don't come against me.

1395
01:34:07,420 --> 01:34:09,560
I will destroy you today.
- I will not leave you.

1396
01:34:09,780 --> 01:34:11,280
I found the gun too.

1397
01:34:11,280 --> 01:34:13,759
You all are dead now.
I will kill if anyone stops me.

1398
01:34:14,320 --> 01:34:17,259
Come out, you rascal!

1399
01:34:17,320 --> 01:34:18,360
Come out if you've any guts.

1400
01:34:18,500 --> 01:34:19,580
Move aside.

1401
01:34:19,800 --> 01:34:22,660
Leave me!

1402
01:34:25,320 --> 01:34:26,160
Get up.

1403
01:34:26,660 --> 01:34:27,220
I will not.

1404
01:34:27,740 --> 01:34:29,040
I'm telling you, get up.

1405
01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:30,240
I will not.

1406
01:34:30,540 --> 01:34:31,580
Please, get up.

1407
01:34:33,060 --> 01:34:33,360
No!

1408
01:34:33,620 --> 01:34:35,980
Sir, the boy and girl have escaped.

1409
01:35:02,360 --> 01:35:04,080
Chandu! I'm starving.

1410
01:35:05,380 --> 01:35:07,100
There's the hotel. Come!

1411
01:35:11,420 --> 01:35:13,740
What do you want?
-Two dosas.

1412
01:35:16,860 --> 01:35:19,019
Money?
-I don't have change for Rs.500.

1413
01:35:19,220 --> 01:35:19,880
These are banned.

1414
01:35:22,160 --> 01:35:22,540
See there.

1415
01:35:32,120 --> 01:35:33,019
I have ten rupees.

1416
01:35:34,880 --> 01:35:35,900
You won't get anything for Rs.10.

1417
01:35:44,940 --> 01:35:47,059
I'm starving, Chandu.

1418
01:35:48,660 --> 01:35:49,680
Meals at Rs.5.

1419
01:35:49,680 --> 01:35:52,260
Pour some dal.
-Curry, please.

1420
01:35:54,640 --> 01:35:55,040
Come.

1421
01:35:59,240 --> 01:36:00,360
Two plates, please.

1422
01:36:12,200 --> 01:36:14,019
You were
with them all yesterday.

1423
01:36:14,620 --> 01:36:16,519
They didn't have
it with you, right?

1424
01:36:36,620 --> 01:36:38,940
Even that ten rupees are spent.

1425
01:36:39,580 --> 01:36:40,680
We don't have any money now.

1426
01:36:41,160 --> 01:36:41,760
What shall we do?

1427
01:36:42,240 --> 01:36:46,660
We can survive without food for a day.
But, we need a place to stay.

1428
01:36:47,300 --> 01:36:49,580
I don't know anything.
-What's that answer?

1429
01:36:49,700 --> 01:36:51,080
Don't you watch films?

1430
01:36:51,240 --> 01:36:55,780
Where hero works in a hotel or
as a bike mechanic to feed heroine.

1431
01:36:55,860 --> 01:36:57,719
You should do something.

1432
01:36:58,080 --> 01:36:59,840
I really don't know anything.

1433
01:37:00,200 --> 01:37:02,920
I didn't even learn
how to drive an auto.

1434
01:37:03,380 --> 01:37:04,540
What to do now?

1435
01:37:08,740 --> 01:37:09,440
You stay here.

1436
01:37:10,500 --> 01:37:10,900
Hello!

1437
01:37:11,660 --> 01:37:12,780
Why are you distributing these?

1438
01:37:12,780 --> 01:37:14,920
There are courses in it.
Learn what you like.

1439
01:37:15,840 --> 01:37:17,860
Why are you distributing these?
-For money.

1440
01:37:18,240 --> 01:37:19,440
How much?
-Two hundred rupees.

1441
01:37:19,980 --> 01:37:23,339
Who will pay us?
-There's address in it. Check it rather asking me.

1442
01:37:24,680 --> 01:37:26,060
What happened?
Who is he?

1443
01:37:26,780 --> 01:37:27,860
Come, I found a work to do.

1444
01:37:27,860 --> 01:37:28,620
Work?
-Yes.

1445
01:37:38,860 --> 01:37:41,620
What do you want?
-Pamphlets.

1446
01:37:43,460 --> 01:37:46,420
Those are ours.
Which course you want to learn?

1447
01:37:46,660 --> 01:37:48,660
No, we want to distribute these.

1448
01:37:49,240 --> 01:37:52,200
Okay, be seated.
I'll bring the sir.

1449
01:37:58,200 --> 01:38:00,860
What do you want?
-Sir, they are willing to distribute pamphlets.

1450
01:38:03,440 --> 01:38:04,540
Give them a thousand pamphlets.

1451
01:38:04,760 --> 01:38:06,040
Okay, sir.
-Alright.

1452
01:38:10,140 --> 01:38:10,740
Take these.

1453
01:38:36,120 --> 01:38:37,360
Let's go and collect the money.

1454
01:38:40,800 --> 01:38:43,060
We have distributed
all pamphlets. Our money?

1455
01:38:49,940 --> 01:38:50,379
Let's go.

1456
01:39:02,620 --> 01:39:04,700
How much it is?
-A total of Rs.2000.

1457
01:39:05,280 --> 01:39:07,780
Two thousand rupees?
-Yes. Ten institutes and Rs.200 each.

1458
01:39:08,220 --> 01:39:10,560
What shall we do now?
-Let's find a hostel.

1459
01:39:11,260 --> 01:39:13,540
Let's pay for the day.
Will see for next days later.

1460
01:39:13,760 --> 01:39:15,180
I don't have any clothes.

1461
01:39:15,960 --> 01:39:17,860
First, let's find a hostel and
then we will go for shopping.

1462
01:39:18,180 --> 01:39:19,860
Have it first.

1463
01:39:20,440 --> 01:39:21,679
You too have some.
-No, I'm okay.

1464
01:39:46,200 --> 01:39:50,800
"I heard that love is a curse."

1465
01:39:50,800 --> 01:39:54,700
"Only the insane could have said it."

1466
01:39:55,540 --> 01:40:00,300
"I heard that to love is a sin."

1467
01:40:00,620 --> 01:40:04,160
"They must have uttered it in unawareness."

1468
01:40:05,140 --> 01:40:07,680
"After they ask for our couple..."

1469
01:40:07,680 --> 01:40:09,680
"After they witness our love..."

1470
01:40:10,120 --> 01:40:14,720
"They would believe that a life
without falling in love isn't worth living."

1471
01:40:15,060 --> 01:40:19,640
"I heard that love is a curse."

1472
01:40:19,780 --> 01:40:23,719
"Only the insane could have said it."

1473
01:40:24,460 --> 01:40:29,040
"I heard that to love is a sin."

1474
01:40:29,300 --> 01:40:32,940
"They must have uttered it in unawareness."

1475
01:41:05,200 --> 01:41:10,059
"Anyone in tender age,
and in desperation can fall in love."

1476
01:41:10,060 --> 01:41:14,620
"But loving alone isn't enough,
we must abide by it forever."

1477
01:41:14,800 --> 01:41:19,720
"Those who unite by
looks and shapes are called lovers."

1478
01:41:19,720 --> 01:41:23,920
"But, for love,
we need hearts rather bodies."

1479
01:41:24,220 --> 01:41:28,860
"Those hearts won't
meet in parks and pubs."

1480
01:41:28,860 --> 01:41:33,440
"The happiness in
true love is something else."

1481
01:41:33,920 --> 01:41:37,700
"That must be written in heaven."

1482
01:41:38,860 --> 01:41:43,519
"I heard that love is a curse."

1483
01:41:43,620 --> 01:41:47,500
"Only the insane could have said it."

1484
01:41:48,480 --> 01:41:53,519
"I heard that to love is a sin."

1485
01:41:53,520 --> 01:41:57,200
"They must have uttered it in unawareness."

1486
01:42:37,740 --> 01:42:42,320
"Love is all about giving
without any expectations."

1487
01:42:42,600 --> 01:42:47,000
"Love dies to see
happiness in the beloved ones."

1488
01:42:47,300 --> 01:42:51,920
"Love is of trust that
doesn't change frequently."

1489
01:42:52,060 --> 01:42:56,480
"Life is a forever celebration
if love exists in it."

1490
01:42:56,480 --> 01:43:01,179
"Love is not found in rich houses."

1491
01:43:01,500 --> 01:43:05,740
"Loving hearts cannot
be bought for any wealth."

1492
01:43:06,140 --> 01:43:10,240
"It should be written in the heaven."

1493
01:43:11,340 --> 01:43:15,820
"I heard that to love is a sin."

1494
01:43:16,360 --> 01:43:20,280
"Only the insane could have said it."

1495
01:43:20,900 --> 01:43:25,660
"I heard that love is a curse."

1496
01:43:25,880 --> 01:43:29,920
"They must have uttered it in unawareness."

1497
01:43:30,300 --> 01:43:32,500
"After they ask for our couple..."

1498
01:43:32,920 --> 01:43:35,060
"After they witness our love..."

1499
01:43:35,320 --> 01:43:39,880
"They would believe that a life
without falling in love isn't worth living."

1500
01:43:40,220 --> 01:43:44,740
"I heard that love is a curse."

1501
01:43:44,920 --> 01:43:49,000
"Only the insane could have said it."

1502
01:43:53,100 --> 01:43:54,020
Get them.

1503
01:44:00,640 --> 01:44:02,260
Brother, got them.
-Bring them.

1504
01:44:02,480 --> 01:44:03,259
Who are they?

1505
01:44:03,260 --> 01:44:05,320
What are you
doing in public park?

1506
01:44:05,700 --> 01:44:06,740
Do you marry her now?

1507
01:44:11,740 --> 01:44:12,880
What are you doing in park?

1508
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:14,880
Who are you?

1509
01:44:15,640 --> 01:44:16,400
What do you want?

1510
01:44:16,580 --> 01:44:19,519
We save our culture
from spoilers like you.

1511
01:44:19,780 --> 01:44:22,040
We are spoiling our culture?

1512
01:44:22,420 --> 01:44:25,360
Not spoiling,
you are totally destroying it.

1513
01:44:25,940 --> 01:44:28,379
Valentines day is not part of our culture.

1514
01:44:28,800 --> 01:44:31,260
You shouldn't roam
like this before marriage.

1515
01:44:32,900 --> 01:44:34,799
People like are you destroying our culture.

1516
01:44:35,320 --> 01:44:38,940
We just came to
have a casual talk. That's it.

1517
01:44:39,140 --> 01:44:41,500
We haven't yet
got the age to marry.

1518
01:44:41,780 --> 01:44:44,340
You are saying
silly reasons like others.

1519
01:44:44,660 --> 01:44:47,720
See there. They too
have silly reasons like you.

1520
01:44:47,940 --> 01:44:50,160
Who will marry her?
She has gone out with many guys.

1521
01:44:50,160 --> 01:44:52,000
You didn't roam with other girls?

1522
01:44:52,540 --> 01:44:54,280
You said me to live
as I wish before marriage?

1523
01:44:54,380 --> 01:44:56,180
You told me that you
wouldn't ask me about my past?

1524
01:44:56,180 --> 01:44:58,040
You even bought me an iphone.

1525
01:44:58,220 --> 01:45:00,140
You are turning me down for marriage?

1526
01:45:02,360 --> 01:45:04,040
If you're true lovers then marry now.

1527
01:45:04,300 --> 01:45:06,320
Otherwise, we will
have to force it on you.

1528
01:45:06,780 --> 01:45:08,400
Truly, you will do our marriage?

1529
01:45:08,620 --> 01:45:09,540
Just permit us.

1530
01:45:10,140 --> 01:45:14,880
"I've been waiting
for us from many lives."

1531
01:45:15,440 --> 01:45:20,200
"We have got this fortune
after all these years."

1532
01:45:20,500 --> 01:45:25,780
"I will not leave you forever."

1533
01:45:26,240 --> 01:45:31,540
"This life isn't enough for the persons
who became a lovely couple."

1534
01:45:31,580 --> 01:45:36,440
"Let's go and
sail through the challenges."

1535
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:41,940
"A century must turn into
a second despite many dreams."

1536
01:45:42,400 --> 01:45:47,200
"I've been waiting
for us from many lives."

1537
01:45:47,420 --> 01:45:52,640
"We have got this fortune
after all these years."

1538
01:45:59,420 --> 01:46:01,420
On the occasion of Valentines day,

1539
01:46:01,540 --> 01:46:05,580
Hindu activists have made
marriages to couples at few places.

1540
01:46:06,260 --> 01:46:08,680
In this regard, all
couples have denied marriage.

1541
01:46:09,020 --> 01:46:14,120
But, a young couple from Ameerpet
have nodded to get married.

1542
01:46:36,460 --> 01:46:37,460
Got you, finally.

1543
01:46:37,520 --> 01:46:38,240
Chandu!

1544
01:46:39,240 --> 01:46:41,820
Come to home,
I'll see your end.

1545
01:46:42,320 --> 01:46:43,740
Leave me, I'll not come.

1546
01:46:43,820 --> 01:46:44,299
Nandu!

1547
01:46:46,120 --> 01:46:47,460
Uncle, don't beat me.

1548
01:46:48,380 --> 01:46:50,560
What is so special about him?

1549
01:46:52,420 --> 01:46:53,300
How dare you
go with him!

1550
01:46:53,460 --> 01:46:54,140
Leave me, uncle!

1551
01:46:55,200 --> 01:46:56,599
I will kill you both.

1552
01:46:58,180 --> 01:46:58,860
Chandu!

1553
01:47:00,500 --> 01:47:01,480
What is your caste?

1554
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:03,340
What is your race?

1555
01:47:03,840 --> 01:47:05,820
Come on.
Bring her.

1556
01:47:05,980 --> 01:47:06,480
Nandu!

1557
01:47:06,680 --> 01:47:08,340
I'll see where
you will go now.

1558
01:47:09,340 --> 01:47:09,900
Come!

1559
01:47:09,980 --> 01:47:11,639
How dare you elope with my girl?
-Record it.

1560
01:47:11,960 --> 01:47:13,200
What are you to do dare it?

1561
01:47:13,680 --> 01:47:15,280
Nandu!
-Bloody immature!

1562
01:47:15,860 --> 01:47:16,500
Walk!

1563
01:47:17,400 --> 01:47:19,059
Hey, throw him inside.

1564
01:47:23,300 --> 01:47:28,280
Despite many disapprovals, Hindu activists
kept on making marriages on roads.

1565
01:47:28,280 --> 01:47:31,780
They are ruining
the lives of teenagers.

1566
01:47:32,100 --> 01:47:37,220
Those activists who conducted the
marriage are nowhere seen now.

1567
01:47:37,660 --> 01:47:42,920
But the parents who saw the news,
have destroyed the marriage.

1568
01:47:43,080 --> 01:47:46,780
Even the public are expressing
their resentment towards activists.

1569
01:47:47,280 --> 01:47:48,440
What do you opine on this?

1570
01:47:48,700 --> 01:47:51,580
Such associations who make marriages
on the name of culture should be banned.

1571
01:47:52,120 --> 01:47:54,500
Where are the activists
who caused turmoil now?

1572
01:47:55,620 --> 01:47:56,780
What is your opinion?

1573
01:47:56,780 --> 01:47:58,820
These activists must
be tied and bashed.

1574
01:47:59,480 --> 01:48:00,120
What about you?

1575
01:48:00,220 --> 01:48:04,460
Because of these associations,
siblings of opposite sex are not able to come out.

1576
01:48:05,360 --> 01:48:06,759
Where are you?

1577
01:48:06,760 --> 01:48:07,880
They are minors, brother.

1578
01:48:07,880 --> 01:48:09,320
I didn't know that.

1579
01:48:09,320 --> 01:48:11,820
Brother, they are filing a case
against us for making marriage.

1580
01:48:11,820 --> 01:48:13,080
We can see this in court.

1581
01:48:13,500 --> 01:48:16,620
I want them at any cost.
-Okay. We will not let them cross the city.

1582
01:48:16,960 --> 01:48:20,160
I know who can solve this problem.

1583
01:48:20,380 --> 01:48:22,900
As you're judge's son,
it would be helpful if you argue.

1584
01:48:31,520 --> 01:48:33,760
This is the car. Stop them!

1585
01:48:38,020 --> 01:48:39,320
Hey, who are you?

1586
01:48:40,760 --> 01:48:42,020
You think I would get afraid?

1587
01:48:42,260 --> 01:48:43,400
What do you think of me?

1588
01:48:44,900 --> 01:48:47,900
Do you know who am I?

1589
01:48:48,640 --> 01:48:49,940
Do you know who am I?

1590
01:49:09,100 --> 01:49:09,920
Your honor,

1591
01:49:11,240 --> 01:49:12,800
our victim, Chandrakanth

1592
01:49:13,420 --> 01:49:18,120
has forcibly kidnapped my client's daughter,

1593
01:49:18,660 --> 01:49:21,800
took her gold ornaments
and married her.

1594
01:49:22,360 --> 01:49:27,639
Few activists have conducted that
marriage in the name of culture, shamelessly.

1595
01:49:27,920 --> 01:49:28,720
Why did he point us?

1596
01:49:29,180 --> 01:49:31,440
So, I request you to

1597
01:49:31,940 --> 01:49:33,740
do justice to my client by

1598
01:49:33,960 --> 01:49:36,200
rejecting the marriage and

1599
01:49:36,700 --> 01:49:42,040
punishing the accused and his supporters.

1600
01:49:42,360 --> 01:49:43,179
Thank you,
 Your honor.

1601
01:49:44,160 --> 01:49:44,700
My lord!

1602
01:49:46,240 --> 01:49:47,440
As a responsible lawyer,

1603
01:49:47,720 --> 01:49:50,180
I have obedience and
respect towards the court.

1604
01:49:50,820 --> 01:49:52,120
I have social awareness too.

1605
01:49:53,020 --> 01:49:55,320
I have the responsibility towards
the values of our system.

1606
01:49:56,540 --> 01:50:01,360
I feel incorrect and
obliged to argue this case.

1607
01:50:02,640 --> 01:50:05,320
Incorrect because it's a minor case.

1608
01:50:07,160 --> 01:50:11,500
Obliged because they
won't be alive if I leave them like this.

1609
01:50:12,940 --> 01:50:16,780
For the first time, the court is witnessing
the law competing against love.

1610
01:50:18,220 --> 01:50:19,780
As there is a solution
for every problem,

1611
01:50:20,200 --> 01:50:21,780
I believe a solution
for this too exists.

1612
01:50:23,680 --> 01:50:26,740
I request the court to grant me
 permission to argue this case.

1613
01:50:26,740 --> 01:50:27,700
Permission granted.

1614
01:50:29,780 --> 01:50:30,440
Thank you,
Your honor!

1615
01:50:31,940 --> 01:50:33,960
Rapes and honor killings
 continue to exist in our country

1616
01:50:34,100 --> 01:50:36,160
because it's believed that
our courts cannot do anything.

1617
01:50:36,240 --> 01:50:39,000
We everyday see in news
that our judicial system is held responsible

1618
01:50:39,080 --> 01:50:41,780
for all the rapes and honor killings in India.

1619
01:50:43,040 --> 01:50:45,800
If you feel the same in my client's case,

1620
01:50:45,800 --> 01:50:48,320
then we will be held
responsible for another honor killing.

1621
01:50:49,980 --> 01:50:51,860
My client didn't kidnap Nandu.

1622
01:50:52,040 --> 01:50:55,019
She came out on her own will.
You can ask her.

1623
01:50:55,760 --> 01:50:57,120
What is there to ask, Your honor?

1624
01:50:58,280 --> 01:51:03,280
Arguing this case would give
opportunity to argue all other waste cases.

1625
01:51:04,380 --> 01:51:08,680
To avoid that scenario,
you must punish the guilty directly.

1626
01:51:09,700 --> 01:51:14,160
Because of such arguments,
everyone stood back without responding.

1627
01:51:15,100 --> 01:51:17,980
Many big shots are wiping off the crime
of raping children and minors,

1628
01:51:18,260 --> 01:51:21,000
by offering huge money to the victims.

1629
01:51:22,460 --> 01:51:24,240
We can punish the criminals.

1630
01:51:24,660 --> 01:51:26,340
But, can we do justice to their iirreparable loss?

1631
01:51:27,440 --> 01:51:30,980
We got the opportunity to do
 justice to them before they ruin.

1632
01:51:32,680 --> 01:51:35,860
Sir, I request you to take forestep.

1633
01:51:36,380 --> 01:51:37,140
Understand it, sir.

1634
01:51:37,520 --> 01:51:40,520
So, you want us to
support minor marriages?

1635
01:51:40,800 --> 01:51:43,600
No, I'm not urging to
support minor marriages, sir.

1636
01:51:43,980 --> 01:51:45,480
I'm asking to see
their status in the society.

1637
01:51:45,760 --> 01:51:48,740
My clients have the capacity to
reach heights without any support.

1638
01:51:48,860 --> 01:51:51,360
They are earning more
than us in digital marketing.

1639
01:51:51,600 --> 01:51:52,860
Please, sir.
Try to understand.

1640
01:51:54,340 --> 01:51:56,000
Earning alone isn't enough.

1641
01:51:56,500 --> 01:51:58,900
Social consciousness is
indeed needed to survive.

1642
01:51:59,960 --> 01:52:03,860
People who married at age of 30
are worried to endure the relationship.

1643
01:52:04,280 --> 01:52:06,800
And you think of
supporting minor marriage?

1644
01:52:07,680 --> 01:52:11,180
You married at the age of 30
and knew social consciousness well,

1645
01:52:11,520 --> 01:52:14,000
yet you divorced your wife
within two years of your marriage.

1646
01:52:17,180 --> 01:52:18,180
Order! Order!

1647
01:52:18,640 --> 01:52:21,000
He's tapping my personal
issues that are irrelevant.

1648
01:52:21,320 --> 01:52:24,059
Your honor! I'm not
talking about his personal issues.

1649
01:52:24,700 --> 01:52:25,920
I'm stressing about the situations.

1650
01:52:26,400 --> 01:52:28,400
Two persons need
mutual affection to live together.

1651
01:52:28,800 --> 01:52:31,000
My clients are affectionate to each other.

1652
01:52:31,300 --> 01:52:32,500
I can guarantee it.

1653
01:52:32,940 --> 01:52:34,980
Court needs laws.

1654
01:52:36,040 --> 01:52:37,600
But not your guarantees.

1655
01:52:37,800 --> 01:52:41,880
Your honor, I request you to
see this case from human insight.

1656
01:52:42,060 --> 01:52:43,120
What do you mean?

1657
01:52:43,460 --> 01:52:45,520
You expect to conduct
marriages to all minors?

1658
01:52:45,700 --> 01:52:49,080
Your honor, I'm talking about
eligible persons, not everyone.

1659
01:52:49,300 --> 01:52:51,200
They have every eligibility to live.

1660
01:52:53,180 --> 01:52:56,660
I know many persons
who had love marriage at minor age,

1661
01:52:57,160 --> 01:52:59,320
and reached pinnacles in life.

1662
01:52:59,800 --> 01:53:02,140
My parents are
an example for this.

1663
01:53:03,660 --> 01:53:06,080
Sir, your son is
showing you as an example.

1664
01:53:08,900 --> 01:53:09,900
Order! Order!

1665
01:53:10,120 --> 01:53:12,620
Your honor, with a favourable convict,

1666
01:53:12,900 --> 01:53:15,700
we could save two lives.

1667
01:53:16,060 --> 01:53:19,720
I'm not asking you to approve
their marriage that is against the law.

1668
01:53:20,140 --> 01:53:23,560
Pass the verdict that approves their
marriage after reaching the lawful age.

1669
01:53:23,980 --> 01:53:26,059
Please don't reject
this marriage till then.

1670
01:53:38,220 --> 01:53:40,340
Do we get punished?
-If so then we will go to jail.

1671
01:53:41,620 --> 01:53:43,280
After hearing the
arguments from both sides,

1672
01:53:44,440 --> 01:53:50,200
I feel sad and bit hard
to pass the verdict in this case.

1673
01:53:51,260 --> 01:53:54,180
Here, two minors got married.

1674
01:53:54,640 --> 01:54:00,820
Lawfully, a man must be 21 and
woman must be 18 to get married.

1675
01:54:01,220 --> 01:54:03,020
But, this case is strange.

1676
01:54:03,440 --> 01:54:07,139
Even the father who has filed
 case against forced minor marriage,

1677
01:54:07,540 --> 01:54:10,800
had attempted to do a
minor marriage in the past.

1678
01:54:11,180 --> 01:54:15,560
After examining these incidents,
we cannot trust his words.

1679
01:54:15,720 --> 01:54:18,660
Neither can we blame these teens.

1680
01:54:18,980 --> 01:54:22,160
Their marriage has been
conducted though they were not willing.

1681
01:54:22,720 --> 01:54:26,800
But this marriage cannot
be approved under any law.

1682
01:54:27,600 --> 01:54:31,940
Court decides that the girl should wait until she turns 18 and

1683
01:54:31,940 --> 01:54:40,500
upon her consent this marriage would be approved.

1684
01:54:43,040 --> 01:54:45,260
Till then the kids must stay with the parents.

1685
01:54:45,260 --> 01:54:47,720
If they don't wish to stay with them

1686
01:54:47,920 --> 01:54:51,520
our court will provide a
facility for them to stay.

1687
01:54:51,940 --> 01:54:54,500
Till then the courts
warns parents and others

1688
01:54:54,660 --> 01:54:57,880
not to put any pressure on the kids.

1689
01:55:01,260 --> 01:55:04,520
Dear, you like to
stay with your parents?

1690
01:55:04,800 --> 01:55:07,800
Sir, why would my
daughter want to stay with me?

1691
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:13,500
No parent who doesn't understand
children has the right to ask it.

1692
01:55:13,740 --> 01:55:15,960
We can give them birth
but cannot snatch their freedom.

1693
01:55:16,940 --> 01:55:22,240
I've been thinking of
my caste and prestige in village.

1694
01:55:23,340 --> 01:55:26,180
I didn't realise that they have
grown enough to make their own decisions.

1695
01:55:26,900 --> 01:55:30,099
If my daughter likes him,
then I would marry her off to him.

1696
01:55:32,600 --> 01:55:35,640
If you permit us,
I would take them to my village and

1697
01:55:35,640 --> 01:55:38,860
conduct their marriage grandly.

1698
01:55:40,740 --> 01:55:42,920
I will keep them with me till
they get the right age to marry.

1699
01:55:43,220 --> 01:55:46,420
If you daughter agrees,
then the court has no objection.

1700
01:55:51,480 --> 01:55:55,620
Dear, I didn't know the
value of your presence till I lost you.

1701
01:55:57,180 --> 01:55:59,200
I wish to see the only
left daughter's marriage.

1702
01:55:59,760 --> 01:56:01,440
Will you fulfill my wish?

1703
01:56:24,200 --> 01:56:27,480
Hey, Chandra Rao, I saw in
TV that your daughter has eloped.

1704
01:56:28,400 --> 01:56:30,200
Chandra Rao, I heard
that your daughter eloped.

1705
01:56:31,320 --> 01:56:33,179
Did you daughter elope?

1706
01:56:38,980 --> 01:56:40,179
You scoundrel!

1707
01:56:40,660 --> 01:56:42,960
You need my daughter?

1708
01:56:43,160 --> 01:56:44,620
You defamed me in village.

1709
01:56:44,740 --> 01:56:45,320
You...

1710
01:56:45,600 --> 01:56:47,360
Get aside! Who are you?

1711
01:56:47,640 --> 01:56:49,040
Why should I
give you my daughter?

1712
01:56:49,180 --> 01:56:50,160
Thrash him more!

1713
01:56:50,320 --> 01:56:51,120
Don't beat him.

1714
01:56:51,120 --> 01:56:53,480
Beat him.
Don't leave him.

1715
01:56:53,480 --> 01:56:54,280
Don't beat him, dad.

1716
01:56:54,280 --> 01:56:56,000
I'm the court and
verdict is mine.

1717
01:56:56,140 --> 01:56:57,840
I won't abide
to other court's verdict.

1718
01:56:58,180 --> 01:56:59,560
You defamed me.

1719
01:56:59,780 --> 01:57:01,240
She disgraced me.

1720
01:57:01,380 --> 01:57:04,900
My punishment for you
both is death sentence.

1721
01:57:05,420 --> 01:57:07,080
Turn the vehicle!

1722
01:57:14,660 --> 01:57:15,980
Get them down!

1723
01:57:17,240 --> 01:57:18,380
You're dead today.

1724
01:57:20,120 --> 01:57:22,900
Kill them and send their traces.
-Okay, sir.

1725
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:24,220
I want the video of their death.

1726
01:57:24,220 --> 01:57:26,380
I will kill them today and
share the video via whatsapp.

1727
01:57:29,200 --> 01:57:30,440
Please, leave us.

1728
01:57:31,860 --> 01:57:32,799
Leave us.

1729
01:57:33,340 --> 01:57:34,180
Don't kill us.

1730
01:57:34,940 --> 01:57:36,580
Don't do anything to us, please.

1731
01:58:03,020 --> 01:58:03,680
Chandu!

1732
01:58:09,440 --> 01:58:09,980
Wait!

1733
01:58:10,400 --> 01:58:11,759
I told you to wait.

1734
01:58:12,120 --> 01:58:14,140
I'll deal it. Wait!

1735
01:58:14,500 --> 01:58:17,100
Let's kill them
like their brother.

1736
01:58:17,500 --> 01:58:20,760
Listen, rather going through our torture,

1737
01:58:21,720 --> 01:58:23,600
you would die easily
if you do as we say.

1738
01:58:24,280 --> 01:58:26,800
We will kill you
without any pain.

1739
01:58:27,040 --> 01:58:27,320
No!

1740
01:58:27,320 --> 01:58:32,099
If not then we will
kill you with axe.

1741
01:58:32,100 --> 01:58:33,020
No!
-No!

1742
01:58:33,160 --> 01:58:38,340
If that happens, the remaining
one will die out of shock.

1743
01:58:38,620 --> 01:58:39,599
No!
-Please, don't

1744
01:58:40,080 --> 01:58:43,040
Tell me. Will you
opt to die as we guide?

1745
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:46,520
Otherwise, you will
die seeing others death?

1746
01:58:47,120 --> 01:58:48,420
We will die as you say.
-We will.

1747
01:58:48,800 --> 01:58:50,160
We will die as you say.

1748
01:58:52,640 --> 01:58:53,260
Stand up.

1749
01:59:18,020 --> 01:59:19,200
Come forward.
-Come!

1750
01:59:40,640 --> 01:59:41,820
Insert your head.
-Wear it.

1751
01:59:42,780 --> 01:59:45,000
Record all of this.

1752
01:59:46,560 --> 01:59:49,740
I've already
started recording it.

1753
02:00:22,560 --> 02:00:24,020
Make it quick.
-Proceed.

1754
02:01:11,440 --> 02:01:12,679
Are we alive?

1755
02:01:13,500 --> 02:01:14,840
You're safe.
-Get up.

1756
02:01:18,420 --> 02:01:21,080
You grew in our hands.
How can we kill you?

1757
02:01:23,220 --> 02:01:26,080
Though we are rowdies,
we are still humans.

1758
02:01:26,880 --> 02:01:27,960
Even we have hearts.

1759
02:01:28,400 --> 02:01:30,240
But, you've killed my brother, right?

1760
02:01:30,660 --> 02:01:31,400
No, dear.

1761
02:01:31,940 --> 02:01:33,780
We played the same trick
and saved them too.

1762
02:01:34,060 --> 02:01:35,000
Your brother is alive.

1763
02:01:35,800 --> 02:01:36,800
There, your brother is.

1764
02:02:04,140 --> 02:02:04,860
Listen to me.

1765
02:02:05,480 --> 02:02:08,540
From now on, make sure
that you don't get noticed

1766
02:02:08,680 --> 02:02:11,360
in village or TV news or in newpapers or anywhere.

1767
02:02:11,560 --> 02:02:13,240
Otherwise, your father would kill us.

1768
02:02:15,080 --> 02:02:17,300
Go somewhere and live happily.

1769
02:02:17,580 --> 02:02:17,800
Bye!

1770
02:02:18,460 --> 02:02:27,780
"Here is a love couple running
hastily for no reason."

1771
02:02:28,700 --> 02:02:37,960
"Here is a love couple running in haze ."

1772
02:03:00,900 --> 02:03:03,799
"Desperation to meet."

1773
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:06,400
"Hesitations come uninvited."

1774
02:03:06,500 --> 02:03:10,820
"This love doesn't need
any introduction."

1775
02:03:11,560 --> 02:03:14,060
"Mornings are full of joys."

1776
02:03:14,240 --> 02:03:16,760
"Worries lay in the evenings."

1777
02:03:16,760 --> 02:03:21,240
"The moment we part,
my mind muddles."

1778
02:03:21,240 --> 02:03:23,620
"To bless our love..."

1779
02:03:23,900 --> 02:03:31,400
"Let's ask the Gods to prosper
our love for years to come."

1780
02:03:31,960 --> 02:03:41,340
"Here is a love couple running
hastily for no reason."
