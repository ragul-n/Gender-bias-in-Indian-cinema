1
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,400
Come on!
–Hurry up!

2
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,000
Careful, watch your step!

3
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,280
Careful, watch your step!

4
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,800
Lead the way, quick!

5
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,000
Why have you brought us
to this school?

6
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,080
Why have you brought us
to this school?

7
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,840
We won't have any raids here
and we don't have to rent a room.

8
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,920
We can have fun.

9
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,000
You attend to your job and we will
focus on the work we came for.

10
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,920
You attend to your job and we will
focus on the work we came for.

11
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,160
We can drink under that tree.
–Over there? Okay!

12
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,280
Come in with me.

13
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,000
Brother, clarify
this doubt for me.

14
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,200
Brother, clarify
this doubt for me.

15
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,840
What?
–Out here in the open,...

16
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,000
...in the middle of the night,
why is it so hot and sweaty?

17
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
...in the middle of the night,
why is it so hot and sweaty?

18
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,600
Come closer.
Smack you!

19
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,000
We drink and sway
from side to side, right?

20
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,200
We drink and sway
from side to side, right?

21
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:18,000
Pour some booze under that tree.
It will also sway like us.

22
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,040
Pour some booze under that tree.
It will also sway like us.

23
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,880
They'll be wind
and you won't sweat!

24
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,000
Take this.

25
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,440
Take this.

26
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,560
We bought illicit liquor
with great difficulty.

27
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,000
You must drink
and sway like us, okay?

28
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,200
You must drink
and sway like us, okay?

29
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,000
I'm pouring it raw,
Swing your branches quickly.

30
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,680
I'm pouring it raw,
Swing your branches quickly.

31
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,520
Come fast!

32
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,960
I have one more question.
–What now?

33
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:00,000
Why is the tree rooted to its spot
even after I poured booze?

34
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,320
Why is the tree rooted to its spot
even after I poured booze?

35
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,760
Hold this.

36
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,000
If you mix hooch and beer,
it will dance like Prabhu Deva!

37
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,600
If you mix hooch and beer,
it will dance like Prabhu Deva!

38
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,000
Go!
–Don't feel shy.

39
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,280
Go!
–Don't feel shy.

40
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,000
I want cool breeze from you
like an air conditioner.

41
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,640
I want cool breeze from you
like an air conditioner.

42
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,000
Now you will dance.

43
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,240
Now you will dance.

44
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,440
1 x 2.....
–Two.

45
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,000
2 x 2.....
–Four.

46
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,080
2 x 2.....
–Four.

47
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:36,000
Karandi! Hooch and beer,
it consumed both...

48
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,760
Karandi! Hooch and beer,
it consumed both...

49
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:40,000
...it is standing still
and not swinging! Hit it!

50
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,000
He's such a pain!

51
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,360
He's such a pain!

52
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,000
I'll be back, dear.

53
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,000
They won't let us be
in peace!

54
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,160
They won't let us be
in peace!

55
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,760
Why did you push me away?

56
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,000
Some sort of magic?

57
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Some sort of magic?

58
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,680
Hey! Don't!
–Don't! Listen to me!

59
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,000
Don't, come here!

60
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,400
Don't, come here!

61
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,200
Fool!

62
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,800
Don't!
–Trying to scare me?

63
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,560
Let's get away from here!

64
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:36,000
Few months before...

65
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,320
Few months before...

66
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:46,240
It's stinking to high heaven.
Why are you pinching your noses?

67
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,920
Why can't one of you
go in and check?

68
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,800
Who? That's the question.
–Someone go and check.

69
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,360
I want to pee badly.
–I feel like giving you an earful.

70
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,000
Shut up!
–Why can't a man go in and check?

71
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,480
Shut up!
–Why can't a man go in and check?

72
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,640
You like kindling the fire
at the worst of times!

73
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,000
Teacher, shall we both
go in and check?

74
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,720
Teacher, shall we both
go in and check?

75
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,880
You are a bigger pain
than this smell! Move aside!

76
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,000
No one needs to take the trouble.
The right person has arrived.

77
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,240
No one needs to take the trouble.
The right person has arrived.

78
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,240
Who?

79
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,920
Anosmic Jothi.

80
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,000
She can't smell
right from birth.

81
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,920
She can't smell
right from birth.

82
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:29,400
Let her go in and check.
We can watch the fun from here.

83
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,840
Sir, why are you standing here?
–Nothing.

84
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:48,000
The bathroom stinks.
No one wants to go in and check.

85
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,560
The bathroom stinks.
No one wants to go in and check.

86
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,360
I believe you can't smell.

87
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,000
We thought you could go in, check
and let us know the problem.

88
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,920
We thought you could go in, check
and let us know the problem.

89
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,880
Devil! Have you toldthe whole world?

90
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,240
You're dead meat!
Okay, sir. I'll go in and check.

91
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,840
Okay.

92
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:21,560
You're carrying a dead dog
like a newborn?

93
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,000
It's life too, sir.
–I'll call the corporation.

94
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,640
It's life too, sir.
–I'll call the corporation.

95
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,880
They will send someone to bury it.
–No need, sir.

96
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
They will throw this dog
in the bin.

97
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,360
They will throw this dog
in the bin.

98
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,840
I'll bury him.
–Do so before the DO arrives.

99
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,000
God bless you. See you.

100
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,240
God bless you. See you.

101
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,000
Only anosmic Jothi
can carry a dead animal.

102
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,520
Only anosmic Jothi
can carry a dead animal.

103
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:17,120
We can't even lift a dog
that is alive and kicking!

104
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:24,000
If I ever have another birth,
I wish to be born like you.

105
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,320
If I ever have another birth,
I wish to be born like you.

106
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:30,000
Because your sense
of smell is excellent.

107
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,120
Because your sense
of smell is excellent.

108
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:35,200
Only I know the emotional trauma
I go through with anosmia.

109
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,000
India's future
is in the beak of my parrot.

110
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,880
India's future
is in the beak of my parrot.

111
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,400
Come on!

112
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:48,000
Pick a lucky card for Damodaran
who has come in good faith to us.

113
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,120
Pick a lucky card for Damodaran
who has come in good faith to us.

114
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:53,480
Don't hesitate.
Pick a card.

115
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,960
You won't pick
without getting your due!

116
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,040
Kubera, the Lord of wealth,
has come to clear your confusion.

117
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:06,000
From this second, every step you
take will give you the right break.

118
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,960
From this second, every step you
take will give you the right break.

119
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,720
You are used to walking
in the sidewalk now.

120
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:12,000
You'll be whizzing past
in a Benz by next month.

121
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,080
You'll be whizzing past
in a Benz by next month.

122
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,520
Hereafter, you.....
You can go now! Pay me, I say!

123
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:22,760
Good morning, madam.
Please sit down.

124
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,000
How much for parrot astrology?
–Rs20.

125
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,320
How much for parrot astrology?
–Rs20.

126
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,000
How much is the parrot?
–What?

127
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,000
This parrot is not for sale.
–Then I won't spare you.

128
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,400
This parrot is not for sale.
–Then I won't spare you.

129
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:35,080
You were born with 6 senses
and you're torturing a bird...

130
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,000
...that only has 3 senses.
You lie through your teeth.

131
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,440
...that only has 3 senses.
You lie through your teeth.

132
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:41,280
Wretched man! You feed it
a single grain and mint money.

133
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,000
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

134
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,440
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

135
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,840
Poor thing! Not knowing its future,
it got stuck with a brute like you.

136
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,000
And you're using it to predict
people's future?

137
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
And you're using it to predict
people's future?

138
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:53,160
If you have the guts, why don't you
try tiger astrology instead?

139
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,000
Good lord!
–Can you?

140
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,280
Good lord!
–Can you?

141
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:58,360
Even if you do, will you
be able to get any losers?

142
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,000
Moron!

143
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,400
Moron!

144
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,360
You've named her Sudhandira Dev
(Goddess of Freedom).

145
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,800
But you have her caged
like this, you fool!

146
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,000
Freedom doesn't apply
only for humans.

147
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,680
Freedom doesn't apply
only for humans.

148
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
It's meant for all living things.
–Sudhandira Devi!

149
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
It's meant for all living things.
–Sudhandira Devi!

150
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,040
Why are you spoiling
my livelihood?

151
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,000
You're torturing a life
and living off it!

152
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,160
You're torturing a life
and living off it!

153
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:22,760
Instead, you can.....

154
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,000
In that singlesweeping glance of hers...

155
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,120
In that singlesweeping glance of hers...

156
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,000
She uprooted me...

157
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,280
She uprooted me...

158
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,000
In that breezy bewitchingglance of hers...

159
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,200
In that breezy bewitchingglance of hers...

160
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:54,000
She uprooted me...

161
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:54,240
She uprooted me...

162
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:59,600
Like someone who heardthe national anthem...

163
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:04,440
She made me stand still...

164
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,000
My stride is so light...

165
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,760
My stride is so light...

166
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,360
I fly like the dustin delight...

167
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,000
I smile to myself...

168
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,840
I smile to myself...

169
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:18,000
I walk with a rushof adrenalin even in solitude...

170
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,520
I walk with a rushof adrenalin even in solitude...

171
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,000
You and I make us...

172
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,520
You and I make us...

173
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:30,000
In my nerves and veins,there's a new chemistry...

174
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,800
In my nerves and veins,there's a new chemistry...

175
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:36,000
Like a gale,blood gushes in every artery...

176
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,680
Like a gale,blood gushes in every artery...

177
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,680
This is warfare,in love, all is fair...

178
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,000
This is a sound, a roarmy heart in uproar...

179
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,320
This is a sound, a roarmy heart in uproar...

180
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,000
Makes me lose control,body, mind, heart and soul...

181
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,000
With a plan, I'll circleyou in this life...

182
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:48,600
With a plan, I'll circleyou in this life...

183
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:53,000
In that enchantingglance of hers...

184
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:54,000
She uprooted me...

185
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,240
She uprooted me...

186
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,000
Fish gravy smells super!

187
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,840
Fish gravy smells super!

188
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,640
I don't know what this is.

189
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,000
A sweet cyclonestormed into me...

190
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,240
A sweet cyclonestormed into me...

191
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,360
My atoms doubledin my besotted body...

192
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,160
My heartbeat tripled quirkily...

193
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,000
Second and minutequadrupled quickly...

194
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,560
Second and minutequadrupled quickly...

195
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,760
Her eyes are beautiful...

196
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,000
Love chants the 5th Veda...

197
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:18,880
Love chants the 5th Veda...

198
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,960
You are not a girl in stature...

199
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,800
You are energy,the 6th element of nature...

200
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,000
Knowingly I lose myselfin glimpses of her...

201
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,160
Knowingly I lose myselfin glimpses of her...

202
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:29,200
Unknowingly I liquefy,crystal clear...

203
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:30,000
As I need you right now,I search for you high and low...

204
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,880
As I need you right now,I search for you high and low...

205
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,000
A new chemistryin my nerves and veins...

206
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,280
A new chemistryin my nerves and veins...

207
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,000
Like a tempest, blood gushesin my artery...

208
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,080
Like a tempest, blood gushesin my artery...

209
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,920
Okay, next.

210
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,520
Okay.

211
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,080
Why are you sprinkling water?
–This is rose water!

212
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,000
Why do you sprinkle
it like water?

213
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,400
Why do you sprinkle
it like water?

214
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,320
This is warfarein love, all is fair...

215
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,000
This is a sound, a roar,my heart in uproar...

216
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,720
This is a sound, a roar,my heart in uproar...

217
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,440
Makes me lose control,body, mind, heart and soul...

218
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:18,000
With a plan, I'll circle youin this life...

219
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,400
With a plan, I'll circle youin this life...

220
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,000
Hello! What?
–Amazing! Super!

221
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,640
Hello! What?
–Amazing! Super!

222
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,520
Not just you,
I meant all your good deeds.

223
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:36,000
I know.
It's unfair on my part...

224
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,160
I know.
It's unfair on my part...

225
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:41,200
...to talk to you in the middle
of the road like this.

226
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,000
It isn't justified. In a nutshell,
I'm going overboard.

227
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,840
It isn't justified. In a nutshell,
I'm going overboard.

228
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:48,000
But I really like you very much.
Shall we get married?

229
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,720
But I really like you very much.
Shall we get married?

230
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,400
You aren't saying a word.

231
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,080
Did I say something
drastically wrong?

232
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,640
Of course it is wrong.

233
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,000
That too asking a mother of 2
this question is a crime.

234
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,840
That too asking a mother of 2
this question is a crime.

235
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,000
Hi!
–Wait, mummy is coming.

236
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,160
Hi!
–Wait, mummy is coming.

237
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,640
For housewives like me,...

238
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,000
...dropping and picking up our kids
from school is our only freedom.

239
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:12,080
...dropping and picking up our kids
from school is our only freedom.

240
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,920
And you have the gall to put
a spoke in my wheel.

241
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,000
Wait!

242
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:18,080
Wait!

243
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,960
Mommy is here!
Shall we go home?

244
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:24,000
Get up.
Let's go!

245
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,280
Get up.
Let's go!

246
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,000
Why are you so late?
–First listen to me.

247
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,320
Why are you so late?
–First listen to me.

248
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,920
Something interesting
happened today.

249
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,840
I was walking home
after doing service.

250
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,000
A fool was following me.

251
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:36,800
A fool was following me.

252
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:40,600
Not knowing that, I turned left
and he was right behind me.

253
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,000
And then?
–Within a few minutes...

254
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,200
And then?
–Within a few minutes...

255
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,640
...into our conversation, he wanted
to know if we could get married.

256
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,000
I was shocked.

257
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:48,800
I was shocked.

258
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:53,560
I almost thought he would take out
a thali from his pocket. Fool!

259
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,000
Guess what I did.

260
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,320
Guess what I did.

261
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,920
I'm your blood!
–Naturally!

262
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:00,000
"Listen, I'm already married,
I am a mother of 2 kids".

263
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,680
"Listen, I'm already married,
I am a mother of 2 kids".

264
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:06,000
As soon as I said mother',
you should have seen his face.

265
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:06,920
As soon as I said mother',
you should have seen his face.

266
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,560
Was it this face?

267
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:20,280
Divya, isn't this the mommy
you saw just now?

268
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,800
Yes.
–I blew it big time!

269
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,760
You've told all the lies
that you could think of.

270
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,400
I've been as truthful
as possible.

271
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,000
I've even decided
that he'll be my son–in–law.

272
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:30,440
I've even decided
that he'll be my son–in–law.

273
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,000
His name is Jagan.

274
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,600
If he needs an introduction,
he is the heights of purity!

275
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,000
We studied together
in a traditional Hindu school.

276
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:36,320
We studied together
in a traditional Hindu school.

277
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,480
We have no family.

278
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,800
I'm there for him,
he's there for me.

279
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,000
If you agree, we can add
you and your family to our family.

280
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,320
If you agree, we can add
you and your family to our family.

281
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,160
What else can one ask for?

282
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,040
How can you decide
as soon as you see someone?

283
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,000
You've got it all wrong.

284
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,160
You've got it all wrong.

285
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:52,000
I liked you
the moment I saw you.

286
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,000
But without your permission,
I can't dream about us, right?

287
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,720
But without your permission,
I can't dream about us, right?

288
00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:00,000
So, I wanted to talk
to you in person.

289
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:00,320
So, I wanted to talk
to you in person.

290
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,800
I need to talk to him in private.
–By all means.

291
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,000
Even I spoke to him for an hour.
He is very friendly.

292
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:06,440
Even I spoke to him for an hour.
He is very friendly.

293
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,400
All the grooms
who came to see you before this...

294
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:11,480
...was given hell on the terrace.
That won't work with him.

295
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,000
Go, get to know him.
Go up with her.

296
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,520
Go, get to know him.
Go up with her.

297
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:24,000
I am not interested
in getting married.

298
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:24,200
I am not interested
in getting married.

299
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:26,080
Why?

300
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:29,440
As far as my dad is concerned,
my wedding is his lifetime dream.

301
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,000
But I feel it is an event that
should never happen in my life.

302
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,720
But I feel it is an event that
should never happen in my life.

303
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,000
Your father told us
about your plight.

304
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,280
Your father told us
about your plight.

305
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,360
I don't think it is such an issue
to refuse marriage altogether.

306
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,040
You won't understand
my problem.

307
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:48,000
You need a lot of tolerance
to take me as your wife.

308
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:48,840
You need a lot of tolerance
to take me as your wife.

309
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,360
You may put up with me
in the beginning.

310
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,920
But I'm doubtful if it will last
a whole lifetime.

311
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,760
A wife should be
a long term life partner,...

312
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:00,000
...not a lifelong burden.
And above all,...

313
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,480
...not a lifelong burden.
And above all,...

314
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,600
...I don't want to be the reason
for losing another dear one.

315
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:10,720
Mom!

316
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,000
Her slippers are missing.
Have you gone to the market again?

317
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,000
Thank God! I can watch TV
without her nagging.

318
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,960
Thank God! I can watch TV
without her nagging.

319
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,000
There goes! I can't be happy
even for a short while.

320
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
There goes! I can't be happy
even for a short while.

321
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:45,920
As if I don't have an option!

322
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,000
Jothi!

323
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,720
Jothi!

324
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,440
Are you back from school?

325
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,000
Useless girl!

326
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:12,280
Useless girl!

327
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,800
I'm the girl who killed my mother
without even realising it!

328
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,000
I can't protect
whoever is with me.

329
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,440
I can't protect
whoever is with me.

330
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:53,320
And my ambition
is to serve people in need.

331
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,000
Whether I live
like Mother Teresa or not,...

332
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,880
Whether I live
like Mother Teresa or not,...

333
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
...I must at least
follow her footsteps.

334
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,000
In order to be of use to people,
I don't like asking permission.

335
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,600
In order to be of use to people,
I don't like asking permission.

336
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,000
By permission, I mean leading
my life on my husband's terms.

337
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:06,480
By permission, I mean leading
my life on my husband's terms.

338
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:12,000
One second! Are you refusing
marriage because you can't smell...

339
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:12,040
One second! Are you refusing
marriage because you can't smell...

340
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:15,160
...or because
you want to serve the needy?

341
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,000
Let me tell you once more.
I like you very much.

342
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,360
Let me tell you once more.
I like you very much.

343
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,000
But you're very confused
right now.

344
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,520
But you're very confused
right now.

345
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,800
It's okay, one day your confusion
will lead to clarity.

346
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,880
I'll feature
in your dream that night.

347
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:34,040
If you dream about me,
let me know through your dad.

348
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
See you.

349
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,320
See you.

350
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,800
Miss Jothi!

351
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,000
I feel destiny
will unite us for sure.

352
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,280
I feel destiny
will unite us for sure.

353
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,760
We'll see.

354
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:52,760
What did your teacher say?
–I've read that angels are fools.

355
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,000
I've seen that in person.
I'll turn her around!

356
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,520
I've seen that in person.
I'll turn her around!

357
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,000
Yes!

358
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:00,840
Yes!

359
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,000
Bye!

360
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:06,360
Bye!

361
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,400
Hi, Jothi.

362
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,000
Unpardonable on my part to follow
you without your permission.

363
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,280
Unpardonable on my part to follow
you without your permission.

364
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:28,040
I'm sorry. But you're
enjoying these photos.

365
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,000
I feel like repeating my mistake
all over again just for that.

366
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:30,800
I feel like repeating my mistake
all over again just for that.

367
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,440
Hello, look here.

368
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,480
I am really serious,
I've made up my mind.

369
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,000
If there is a life partner for me,
it can only be you.

370
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,440
If there is a life partner for me,
it can only be you.

371
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,200
If you don't agree
even after this,...

372
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,000
...hereafter, I'll be
all alone in solitude.

373
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,200
...hereafter, I'll be
all alone in solitude.

374
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:46,080
I have decided.
Your call now.

375
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,000
Dad here, did you see the video
my son–in–law sent?

376
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:54,680
Dad here, did you see the video
my son–in–law sent?

377
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:57,920
Simply superb. Isn't he smart?
I was so.....

378
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:00,000
Put the phone down, you fraud!
Drunkard!

379
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,680
Put the phone down, you fraud!
Drunkard!

380
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,160
Okay!

381
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,520
Hi, dear,
isn't this the 7th week?

382
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:24,000
Your vow ends on this auspicious
Karthigai evening.

383
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,400
Your vow ends on this auspicious
Karthigai evening.

384
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:28,040
I'm sure the Goddess
will grant your wishes.

385
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:30,000
Thanks, sister.
–No problem.

386
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:30,320
Thanks, sister.
–No problem.

387
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:47,520
Girls my age will usuallywish for a good groom.

388
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,000
But my wish is,I should never get married.

389
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,040
But my wish is,I should never get married.

390
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,840
No one should sufferbecause of me.

391
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:58,200
Somehow change the mindsof my father and Jagan...

392
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,000
...who follows melike a shadow, please.

393
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,760
...who follows melike a shadow, please.

394
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,000
Look! Her sari
has caught fire!

395
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,320
Look! Her sari
has caught fire!

396
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:58,560
Girl, I saw your sari catch fire
and I screamed my throat hoarse.

397
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,000
Didn't you hear me?

398
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Didn't you hear me?

399
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,480
Not with the sound of crackers
and the temple bell.

400
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,000
How could she not even sense
the burning smell of her sari?

401
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,560
How could she not even sense
the burning smell of her sari?

402
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,280
There are so many oil lamps
lit all over the place.

403
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,000
It's difficult to sense
with all those wicks burning.

404
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:12,680
It's difficult to sense
with all those wicks burning.

405
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:17,120
I hope you realise that Lord Shiva
has come in his form to save you.

406
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,000
Whatever happened
is for your own good.

407
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,680
Whatever happened
is for your own good.

408
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,480
At least now
do you realise, Jothi?

409
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,000
You need someone to protect you.

410
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,840
You need someone to protect you.

411
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,200
I'm not advising you
because I saved you.

412
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,000
I want you to be able
to protect yourself.

413
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,520
I want you to be able
to protect yourself.

414
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,760
The rest is up to you.

415
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:04,320
Even if there's a bathroom
near the gate for me to pee,...

416
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,000
...why can't I opt for an open
and free atmosphere?

417
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,440
...why can't I opt for an open
and free atmosphere?

418
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,000
It feels so good.

419
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,640
It feels so good.

420
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,760
Don't hit me!

421
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:51,120
What happened here?
Open your mouth and speak up.

422
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,960
Why blurt out the truth
and pee in fright whole day?

423
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:59,040
Why don't you tell me?
–After we unloaded the stock,...

424
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,000
...I locked the room
and gave him the key.

425
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,080
...I locked the room
and gave him the key.

426
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,360
I kept the key in your room
and locked your room, sir.

427
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,000
Then who created this havoc?

428
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,760
Even if it was a thief,
he'll steal the stuff.

429
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:10,680
Why would he break everything
and leave? Who is the intruder?

430
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,000
If you knew who dropped in,
you would be dripping like me!

431
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,040
If you knew who dropped in,
you would be dripping like me!

432
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:16,320
Watchman, what were you doing
when all this happened last night?

433
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,000
Sir.....
–Just shut up!

434
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:18,200
Sir.....
–Just shut up!

435
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,960
You are the main culprit.

436
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,840
At night, you get drunk
and pass out.

437
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,640
I have been receiving
so many complaints about you.

438
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,000
You won't say this if you knew
the value of liquor!

439
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,960
You won't say this if you knew
the value of liquor!

440
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,120
If the DO questions me,
who will answer him?

441
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,000
Who will take the responsibility?
We have no other go.

442
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:30,760
Who will take the responsibility?
We have no other go.

443
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,480
Till we get the next load,
all of us will pitch in...

444
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,000
...from our salary and
buy some quality groceries.

445
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,360
...from our salary and
buy some quality groceries.

446
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:41,720
Do not pay this watchman
his salary!

447
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,440
Instead of busting the ghost,
he is pinching my pocket!

448
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:47,800
God knows what other tricks
it will do!

449
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:58,040
Hold the cup properly.

450
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:04,760
All the teachers bring
a variety of food from home.

451
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,000
But you sit with the kids and eat.
I feel so proud of you.

452
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,240
But you sit with the kids and eat.
I feel so proud of you.

453
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,680
Thanks.
–It's alright.

454
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,000
Aayamma, give me an egg.
–This egg is the burning issue now.

455
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,760
Aayamma, give me an egg.
–This egg is the burning issue now.

456
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,040
She is a good teacher.

457
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,680
Eat, children.

458
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:27,520
She tastes it first.
This works in our favour too.

459
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,000
Teacher, I know
you don't like egg.

460
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:30,840
Teacher, I know
you don't like egg.

461
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,040
This is for you.

462
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,000
Why are you called
Egg Murthy?

463
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,880
Why are you called
Egg Murthy?

464
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,000
When my mother was expecting me,
she never used to eat properly.

465
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:42,920
When my mother was expecting me,
she never used to eat properly.

466
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,760
So, my legs became crooked.

467
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Only if I eat well,
I can have babies like you.

468
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,120
Only if I eat well,
I can have babies like you.

469
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:54,000
Ask her why she is called
Nutrition Sandhya?

470
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:54,600
Ask her why she is called
Nutrition Sandhya?

471
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:57,160
How did you get that nickname?

472
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:59,880
I'll collect food
in 3 container daily, teacher.

473
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:05,040
I'll eat this one now.
I'll eat this for dinner.

474
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,000
I'll pour water in this and
have it for breakfast tomorrow.

475
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,200
I'll pour water in this and
have it for breakfast tomorrow.

476
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:12,000
My mother is a single mother
and we have a loan of Rs5 lakhs.

477
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:12,360
My mother is a single mother
and we have a loan of Rs5 lakhs.

478
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:16,480
We are repaying our loan
by saving on food.

479
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,000
Only this noon meal scheme
is my food.

480
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,160
Only this noon meal scheme
is my food.

481
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,000
Take your mother to a hotel
and eat a good meal today.

482
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,760
Take your mother to a hotel
and eat a good meal today.

483
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,320
You educate me.

484
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,000
I don't want to take
money from you, teacher.

485
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:36,000
Hereafter, no one should call
anyone by their nickname.

486
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:36,240
Hereafter, no one should call
anyone by their nickname.

487
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:39,080
Your name is Murthy
and you are Sandhya.

488
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,240
Heard me?
–Okay, teacher.

489
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,000
Teacher, the headmaster
wants to see you.

490
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,120
Teacher, the headmaster
wants to see you.

491
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:45,640
Tell him I'm coming.

492
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,840
May I come in, sir?
–Yes, please.

493
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,960
Come in, Jothi.

494
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:53,600
Question papers have to be prepared
for the exams by next week.

495
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:54,000
If I entrust this job
to the other teachers,...

496
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,680
If I entrust this job
to the other teachers,...

497
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,160
...they will only give
after our students leave school...

498
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,000
...and get a job.
You are a perfectionist.

499
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,680
...and get a job.
You are a perfectionist.

500
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:04,880
Without minding
the late hours of work,...

501
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
...finish this entire task so I can
check everything in the morning.

502
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,440
...finish this entire task so I can
check everything in the morning.

503
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:18,000
It has come again.

504
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:18,200
It has come again.

505
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:21,040
I don't know
what will happen next.

506
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:23,560
I'd better go!

507
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:41,760
Get up! Help!

508
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:46,280
Help!

509
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:00,000
That girl saved you.
–Thank you, dear.

510
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,120
That girl saved you.
–Thank you, dear.

511
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:03,840
Where was the fire?
Are you all right?

512
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,840
Why did you come down?

513
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:17,600
Why did you come down?
–I knew.

514
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,000
You knew? How did you know?
–I just knew.

515
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,640
You knew? How did you know?
–I just knew.

516
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,000
That's what I'm asking you.
How did you realise?

517
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,680
That's what I'm asking you.
How did you realise?

518
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:28,720
Did you smell the wire burning?

519
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,000
Is that the smell
of burning wire, dad?

520
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,200
Is that the smell
of burning wire, dad?

521
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,680
One minute.

522
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:36,000
Here, smell this.

523
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,120
Here, smell this.

524
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,920
Smell it.

525
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:42,000
I like it, but I don't, dad.

526
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:42,680
I like it, but I don't, dad.

527
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:52,200
Smell these flowers.

528
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,000
Inhale properly.

529
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:54,400
Inhale properly.

530
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,920
This is a pleasant smell.
–How?

531
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:04,480
It nice, dad.
–My baby!

532
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,000
You can smell now.

533
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:12,000
You can smell now.

534
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:12,720
You can smell now.

535
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:36,000
From earth to sky,far and near...

536
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,560
From earth to sky,far and near...

537
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:40,960
A festive fragrancein the atmosphere...

538
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,000
Without asking permission...

539
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,960
Without asking permission...

540
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:48,000
My nostrils learnta new language...

541
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:48,160
My nostrils learnta new language...

542
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,760
Full stop to ridiculeand mockery...

543
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:54,000
My woes flewout of my window...

544
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,360
My woes flewout of my window...

545
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:58,960
Happiness engulfed me instead...

546
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,000
A new chapter of joy...

547
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,600
A new chapter of joy...

548
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,720
Hurdles crossed,I climbed steps...

549
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,000
Wings sprouted,today I fly up to the sky...

550
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,880
Wings sprouted,today I fly up to the sky...

551
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:12,000
Overriding fate, finding new wayswith a stronger heart in place...

552
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,520
Overriding fate, finding new wayswith a stronger heart in place...

553
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,000
From earth to sky...

554
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,960
From earth to sky...

555
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:24,000
Now I'm aware of the wonderfularomas around me...

556
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:28,880
You've wearing a men's cologne?
–Yes.

557
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,000
How did she know?

558
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,880
How did she know?

559
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,000
Teacher Jothi is becoming
more prettier than me by the day.

560
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,520
Teacher Jothi is becoming
more prettier than me by the day.

561
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:00,000
Students,
before I open my eyes,...

562
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:00,160
Students,
before I open my eyes,...

563
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,880
...I want all those
who haven't showered...

564
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,000
...or washed their uniforms
to stand up.

565
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:06,720
...or washed their uniforms
to stand up.

566
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,800
So many of you?
–Yes, teacher.

567
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,480
Why?
–Teacher!

568
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,640
You know what my mother
said about you?

569
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,000
As if your teacher
can smell it.

570
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:18,800
As if your teacher
can smell it.

571
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,880
Teacher, do you know
what my mother said about you?

572
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,160
Please, I don't want to know.

573
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,000
I'm not teaching you
in this classroom today.

574
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,120
I'm not teaching you
in this classroom today.

575
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:27,680
Let's go to the playground.

576
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:06,000
My feet is dancing away...

577
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:06,600
My feet is dancing away...

578
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:10,240
100 curious sparrowsgather around...

579
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,000
Even school is closed today...

580
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,720
Even school is closed today...

581
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:17,880
To serve peoplebrings happiness...

582
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,440
Happiness blindfolds me...

583
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:24,000
My wish list dancesto a folk tune melody...

584
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:24,880
My wish list dancesto a folk tune melody...

585
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,600
Service to the needywith love daily...

586
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,000
We will earna fat salary dutifully...

587
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,160
We will earna fat salary dutifully...

588
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,840
A good deed a day...

589
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:36,000
...will makeour lives extra special...

590
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,360
...will makeour lives extra special...

591
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:42,000
Come here...

592
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:42,840
Come here...

593
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,840
Roads in Chennaiare spick and span...

594
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:48,000
...sparkling like a sari...

595
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:48,640
...sparkling like a sari...

596
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:54,000
My mind jumps in joy like a bullthat won a jallikattu contest...

597
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,560
My mind jumps in joy like a bullthat won a jallikattu contest...

598
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:10,480
Thank God I escaped.

599
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:03,320
Traders and Construction Workers
Union leader, Mr. Mahadevan,...

600
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,520
...was found dead this morning
in the most brutal manner.

601
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:06,000
The cause of death is unknown.

602
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,680
The cause of death is unknown.

603
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,960
A thorough investigation
is being conducted now.

604
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:12,000
Mr. Sanyasa Murthy,
Central Health Minister,...

605
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,280
Mr. Sanyasa Murthy,
Central Health Minister,...

606
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,960
...is expected to arrive
any moment now.

607
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,640
Sir, the deceased, Mr. Mahadevan,
is your close friend.

608
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,640
What is the likely cause
of death?

609
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:30,000
Ladies shouldn't come
near him, move aside.

610
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,360
Ladies shouldn't come
near him, move aside.

611
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:36,000
What happened?
–Sir, I interrogated everyone.

612
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:36,760
What happened?
–Sir, I interrogated everyone.

613
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:39,160
Ramalingam, the mason who works
here, found the deceased.

614
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:42,000
We have summoned all the workers
and we are interrogating them now.

615
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:42,640
We have summoned all the workers
and we are interrogating them now.

616
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:45,440
We are confused if his death
was an accident or murder, sir.

617
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:47,560
We are inquiring, sir.

618
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:58,960
He'll look at all this.

619
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,000
But he won't give a second lookat the people who voted for him.

620
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,560
But he won't give a second lookat the people who voted for him.

621
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,520
If you look at the fear
in his eyes,...

622
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,000
...he wasn't scared of death.
He was petrified of the killer.

623
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,080
...he wasn't scared of death.
He was petrified of the killer.

624
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:11,560
This is definitely murder.
–Sir, it can't be just a killer.

625
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:12,000
I don't care if there
was one or many killers.

626
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,680
I don't care if there
was one or many killers.

627
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:16,760
Within 12 hours,
I want him in my office.

628
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:22,080
My boss didn't even pass 5th grade.
But he is ordering an IPS officer.

629
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,000
This is politics!

630
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:24,120
This is politics!

631
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,840
Did you hear that?
What do we do now, sir?

632
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,440
What do we normally do?

633
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:29,720
Check the CCTV footages
in the neighbourhood.

634
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:35,680
Minister's house? Come again?
–There isn't any footage, sir.

635
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,760
No footage in north
or south, sir.

636
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:39,760
No footages in east
or west either.

637
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:42,000
What are you saying?
That minister will hack us!

638
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:42,160
What are you saying?
That minister will hack us!

639
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:44,440
Sir, it seems someone has
killed the minister.

640
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:30,000
How did my brother die?

641
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,080
How did my brother die?

642
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:35,000
He was murdered after his
yoga routine, when he was praying.

643
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:37,960
As per the post mortem report,...

644
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:40,400
...he was strangled
by his own Rudraksha chain.

645
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:48,000
There is no evidence
of an entry by any outsider.

646
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:48,720
There is no evidence
of an entry by any outsider.

647
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:53,880
Even in the CCTV footage,
10 minutes before your brother...

648
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,720
...and Mahadevan were together,
connection was lost completely.

649
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:00,000
There is some connection
between the 2 murders.

650
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,400
There is some connection
between the 2 murders.

651
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:18,000
I checked more than once,
I couldn't get a single evidence.

652
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,320
I checked more than once,
I couldn't get a single evidence.

653
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:22,400
Is that so?
–Give me that photo.

654
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:26,960
Look at this.

655
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:56,240
Someone has fallen
into his trap.

656
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,080
How did you omit this?
–Sorry, sir.

657
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:00,000
I'll call forensic at once.
–Call them in right now.

658
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:00,320
I'll call forensic at once.
–Call them in right now.

659
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:11,960
So much of confusion.

660
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:13,680
Very rare case.

661
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:15,720
Actually the density
of this footprint...

662
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:18,000
...fits neither a man nor woman.
–I don't understand.

663
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:18,640
...fits neither a man nor woman.
–I don't understand.

664
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:21,640
Usually when a man walks,
even if he weighs 35 kg,...

665
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:24,000
...the impression will be heavy.
In the case of a woman,...

666
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:26,560
...even if she weighs 85 kg,
the foot impression will be light.

667
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:29,160
But both densities
are mixed in this.

668
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:30,000
Do you mean a transgender?
–Good question. To be precise,...

669
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,520
Do you mean a transgender?
–Good question. To be precise,...

670
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:35,880
...based on the raw
cut leg impression,...

671
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:40,400
...cutting to a micro milimeter
range and patching everything,...

672
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:42,000
...I need to match the density
to be able to say anything.

673
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,480
...I need to match the density
to be able to say anything.

674
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:45,680
So, give me 2 days.

675
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:47,240
I'll finish my tour
and tell you all my findings.

676
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:48,000
Bye, guys. Bye, brother.
–How dare! Tour?

677
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,920
Bye, guys. Bye, brother.
–How dare! Tour?

678
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:54,000
Please, sir, don't.
–Do you know the value of 2 days?

679
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,680
Please, sir, don't.
–Do you know the value of 2 days?

680
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:59,080
I swear I don't know, sir.

681
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:00,000
2 days before, those who were alive
are dead all of a sudden.

682
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,600
2 days before, those who were alive
are dead all of a sudden.

683
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:06,000
Do it immediately.

684
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:06,800
Do it immediately.

685
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:10,360
So sweet!

686
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:12,000
Happy Teacher's day.
–Thanks.

687
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,440
Happy Teacher's day.
–Thanks.

688
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:17,960
Didn't I tell you,
destiny will unite you and me.

689
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:22,760
Coffee.
Without sugar, sir.

690
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:30,000
Don't think I asked you out
for coffee and I'm talking nonstop.

691
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:30,560
Don't think I asked you out
for coffee and I'm talking nonstop.

692
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:34,880
I never regretted the fact
that I have no parents.

693
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:38,880
Because I've never seen them.

694
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:41,880
But I saw you.

695
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:48,000
If you are not in my life,
I will regret it very much.

696
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:48,200
If you are not in my life,
I will regret it very much.

697
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:52,440
Because, Jothi, I've seen
a certain kind of life.

698
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:54,000
I've lived life to the fullest.
But everything seems different now.

699
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,480
I've lived life to the fullest.
But everything seems different now.

700
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:00,000
You got back
your sense of smell.

701
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,280
You got back
your sense of smell.

702
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:06,000
So, won't I occupy your heart?

703
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:06,920
So, won't I occupy your heart?

704
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:09,320
I will.

705
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:12,000
You can call me whenever
you feel like talking to me.

706
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,240
You can call me whenever
you feel like talking to me.

707
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:16,280
Bye.

708
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:34,480
It was just a dream.
–I really like you very much.

709
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:36,000
I feel destiny
will unite us for sure.

710
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,080
I feel destiny
will unite us for sure.

711
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:52,320
Dad, I'm attending Ramya's wedding
and I'll eat there.

712
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:54,000
Bye!
–Jothi!

713
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:54,560
Bye!
–Jothi!

714
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:56,960
When will we serve
your wedding feast?

715
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:00,000
Shouldn't you be the one
to decide, dad?

716
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,560
Shouldn't you be the one
to decide, dad?

717
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:06,000
Really?
–Yes, dad.

718
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,040
Really?
–Yes, dad.

719
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:11,360
All the prospective grooms who came
only looked at my disability.

720
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:15,840
Some of them eyed what little 
wealth we have accumulated.

721
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:18,000
But it was only Jagan...

722
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,120
But it was only Jagan...

723
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:22,960
...who understood clearly
I was in a confused state of mind.

724
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:24,000
My baby!
This is enough for me!

725
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,720
My baby!
This is enough for me!

726
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:27,760
I'll take care of everything.
Go and have fun.

727
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:30,000
God!

728
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,600
God!

729
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Footprint's density confirmsthe killer is a transgender, sir.

730
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:06,800
Footprint's density confirmsthe killer is a transgender, sir.

731
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:33,280
Sir, just as you suspected,
this is a lady's strand of hair.

732
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:36,000
I don't know all that.
Who is she?

733
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,080
I don't know all that.
Who is she?

734
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:40,320
How does she look like?
Where can we find her?

735
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:42,000
Is it possible to trace her face
based on this hair strand?

736
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,480
Is it possible to trace her face
based on this hair strand?

737
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:46,360
Impossible, sir, no such technology
is available in India.

738
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:48,000
No one can do it.
–It can be done, sir.

739
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,880
No one can do it.
–It can be done, sir.

740
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:52,920
How?
–First time in the world,...

741
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:54,000
...someone has invented this
3 years ago.

742
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:54,800
...someone has invented this
3 years ago.

743
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:57,000
They are called
information artists.

744
00:49:57,120 --> 00:50:00,000
They can certainly trace the person
based on the item he or she used.

745
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,360
They can certainly trace the person
based on the item he or she used.

746
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:03,520
How?
–From cigarette butts...

747
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:06,000
...used by humans
to the gum chewed and spat out,...

748
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:06,040
...used by humans
to the gum chewed and spat out,...

749
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:10,960
...they have proved the face
can be drawn through DNA tests.

750
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:12,000
Where are they?
–In the US, sir.

751
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,560
Where are they?
–In the US, sir.

752
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:15,400
Americans are really brainy.

753
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:17,640
This technique was invented
by an Indian, sir.

754
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,960
Is she the owner
of that strand of hair?

755
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:17,880
Yes, of course, 100 percent.

756
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:21,200
Take this photo,
match it with our Aadhar system...

757
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:23,400
...and bring her here.

758
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:26,000
Right away!

759
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:35,600
Tell me.

760
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:40,280
What is your link with my men?
Why did you kill them? Tell me!

761
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:42,000
I swear I don't know.
I am a teacher.

762
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,240
I swear I don't know.
I am a teacher.

763
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:46,720
I don't even harm
the smallest of insects.

764
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:48,000
I haven't killed anyone.
I don't know.

765
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,200
I haven't killed anyone.
I don't know.

766
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:54,000
Are you teaching us?
I know you killed my men.

767
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:54,840
Are you teaching us?
I know you killed my men.

768
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:56,520
I have proof
of every move you made.

769
00:51:56,640 --> 00:52:00,000
Tell me, why did you kill them?
–I don't know.

770
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:00,400
Tell me, why did you kill them?
–I don't know.

771
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:10,320
It's okay if you kill me.
I can tell only if I'm the killer.

772
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:12,000
I haven't killed anyone.
I will never commit that sin.

773
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,520
I haven't killed anyone.
I will never commit that sin.

774
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:16,960
It shouldn't be done either.
–Showing off your acting skill?

775
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:20,560
She won't budge
if we ask her gently.

776
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:24,000
Strip her from head to toe and
check her out in her birthday suit.

777
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:24,160
Strip her from head to toe and
check her out in her birthday suit.

778
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:25,960
Then she will talk.

779
00:52:58,080 --> 00:53:00,000
Hey, where did she go?

780
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:00,640
Hey, where did she go?

781
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:51,160
Brother, she is here.

782
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:59,640
Where are you going?

783
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:03,560
You can't escape from us.

784
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:58,480
Hey! What's up?
–Don't know, brother.

785
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:00,000
Go and check.

786
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:00,640
Go and check.

787
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:03,440
Who are you?

788
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:05,880
Don't you know?

789
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,920
Who?

790
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:10,720
Don't you recognise me?
–Who are you?

791
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:18,000
Didn't you die?

792
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
Didn't you die?

793
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:23,760
It has been 32 days
since I died.

794
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:24,000
I didn't.....
Don't hurt me!

795
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,840
I didn't.....
Don't hurt me!

796
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:30,000
I am the one who killed your men.
I'll kill the remaining rogues too.

797
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,720
I am the one who killed your men.
I'll kill the remaining rogues too.

798
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:36,000
Please spare me!

799
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:36,920
Please spare me!

800
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:05,280
Is anybody here?

801
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:09,640
Can someone hear me?
Who is here?

802
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:12,000
Please tell me,
who is here?

803
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:12,240
Please tell me,
who is here?

804
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:26,040
With love, Jagan.

805
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:27,720
Jagan!

806
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:30,000
Amazing! Super!

807
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,080
Amazing! Super!

808
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:33,560
If there is a life partner for me,it can only be you.

809
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:35,480
If you don't agreeeven after this,...

810
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:36,000
...hereafter I'll always beall alone in solitude.

811
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,440
...hereafter I'll always beall alone in solitude.

812
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:48,000
I should stand
before you as a human,...

813
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,040
I should stand
before you as a human,...

814
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:52,840
...are you wondering why I am
an apparition like this?

815
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:54,000
Do you know what happened, Jothi?

816
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,640
Do you know what happened, Jothi?

817
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:26,840
Brother, a glass of tea.

818
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:35,360
Brother, won't you give it
in my hand?

819
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:36,000
Did it spill? Drink it.

820
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,720
Did it spill? Drink it.

821
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:48,000
Brother, you rinse
the glass in dirty water.

822
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,840
Brother, you rinse
the glass in dirty water.

823
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:51,800
Can't you wash it with fresh water?
It's stinking.

824
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:54,000
Don't bug me when I'm working.

825
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:54,160
Don't bug me when I'm working.

826
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:56,000
I'll splash hot water
on your face, get lost!

827
01:00:56,360 --> 01:00:58,760
You could use that hot water
to rinse the glass.

828
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:00,000
Brother, why don't you mind
your business?

829
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:00,880
Brother, why don't you mind
your business?

830
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,200
Drink your tea
and go instead of arguing.

831
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:05,000
Every tea shop
has a preacher like this!

832
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:06,000
I'll deal with you later.

833
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,520
I'll deal with you later.

834
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:12,000
Oh God!

835
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,760
Oh God!

836
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:17,480
Didn't you find
any other place to spit?

837
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:18,000
You spat on my boss's car!
–What is the problem here?

838
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,920
You spat on my boss's car!
–What is the problem here?

839
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:23,480
He has been creating a scene
from when he came here.

840
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:24,000
I didn't do anything, brother.
Hold this.

841
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,480
I didn't do anything, brother.
Hold this.

842
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:28,640
You own this shop, right?

843
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:30,000
Your business
is doing well, right?

844
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:30,320
Your business
is doing well, right?

845
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:34,480
You charge Rs10 for tea, brother.
Wages, Rs2. Investment, Rs3.

846
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:36,000
You make a profit of Rs5 per glass.
How many people drink tea?

847
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,600
You make a profit of Rs5 per glass.
How many people drink tea?

848
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:41,400
He's rinsing the glass
in the same dirty water.

849
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:42,000
I can't even take a sip.
The tea powder is bad.

850
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,680
I can't even take a sip.
The tea powder is bad.

851
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:46,760
Forget about that. These fritters
are edible items, right?

852
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:48,000
Why can't you keep them
in a closed glass box?

853
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
Why can't you keep them
in a closed glass box?

854
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:52,440
Won't the dust from the road
settle on it?

855
01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:54,000
Do you expect us to spend
Rs10 on fritters...

856
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:54,240
Do you expect us to spend
Rs10 on fritters...

857
01:01:54,360 --> 01:01:57,040
...and pay another Rs100
to a doctor?

858
01:01:57,160 --> 01:02:00,000
I commented on the lack of hygiene.
Is that a crime?

859
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:00,200
I commented on the lack of hygiene.
Is that a crime?

860
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:02,880
Look at this painter
who is wagging his tongue!

861
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:05,040
If you let your tongue run,...

862
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:06,000
...I'll call the jeep to haul you
behind bars. Shut up and go!

863
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,800
...I'll call the jeep to haul you
behind bars. Shut up and go!

864
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:10,840
Great!
I am here to shut, brother.

865
01:02:11,320 --> 01:02:12,000
But you don't have to call
for any vehicle, I'll handle it.

866
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,080
But you don't have to call
for any vehicle, I'll handle it.

867
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:17,960
Want to watch?

868
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:29,880
This tea master is not clean.
He isn't wearing a hygiene cap.

869
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,680
No glass racks for the snacks.
No 'No smoking' board.

870
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:35,840
This tea powder is adulterated.
Seal it!

871
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:45,200
Do you know whom
you're pitting against?

872
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:47,240
Do you think I'll be scared
if you seal this shop?

873
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:48,000
I'm the president
of the Tea Shop Owners' Union.

874
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,200
I'm the president
of the Tea Shop Owners' Union.

875
01:02:49,320 --> 01:02:51,520
I own 152 tea shops
in Chennai alone.

876
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:53,640
I've seen many officers like you.

877
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:54,000
Within an hour,
I'll reopen the shop.

878
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,840
Within an hour,
I'll reopen the shop.

879
01:02:55,960 --> 01:02:58,200
Want to watch?

880
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:04,320
Then not only this tea stall,...

881
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:06,000
...seal all the 152 shops
owned by him.

882
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:07,440
...seal all the 152 shops
owned by him.

883
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:15,520
Tell them you acted on orders
issued by Assistant Commissioner...

884
01:03:15,640 --> 01:03:18,000
...Food Safety Department,
Jagannathan.

885
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:18,160
...Food Safety Department,
Jagannathan.

886
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:21,520
Let me see who has the guts
to reopen the shops.

887
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:27,440
Get lost!

888
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:33,280
Painter, write that number
plate properly.

889
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:35,040
Brother, from tomorrow
look for another job.

890
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:36,000
Sir, is it you?
Your disguise is too good.

891
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,000
Sir, is it you?
Your disguise is too good.

892
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:38,680
Why are you late?

893
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:40,400
I got delayed as I had social work
to do along the way.

894
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:41,920
What did you do?
–There was an accident.

895
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:43,760
Did you go to the hospital?
–No, I took video,...

896
01:03:43,880 --> 01:03:45,440
...uploaded it on Facebook
and commented 'feeling sad'.

897
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:47,280
I've tagged you as well, sir.

898
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:48,000
Pick up the cycle and items,
find your way to the office.

899
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:49,720
Pick up the cycle and items,
find your way to the office.

900
01:03:49,840 --> 01:03:53,200
Sir! Sir, they will.....

901
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:54,000
The entire world is doing it.
As if I am the only one doing it!

902
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,080
The entire world is doing it.
As if I am the only one doing it!

903
01:03:58,360 --> 01:04:00,000
Sir, it was a tea shop yesterday.
Where will we raid today?

904
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:00,240
Sir, it was a tea shop yesterday.
Where will we raid today?

905
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:04,960
No raid today, I'm hungry.
Shall we stop to eat along the way?

906
01:04:05,120 --> 01:04:06,000
Sorimuthu, are you hungry?

907
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:07,040
Sorimuthu, are you hungry?

908
01:04:07,160 --> 01:04:08,760
Past 2 days, he didn't evenget us a glass of water...

909
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:10,360
...and he's askingif we are hungry.

910
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:12,000
Muthu, I was talking to you.
–I've been starving for 2 days.

911
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:12,800
Muthu, I was talking to you.
–I've been starving for 2 days.

912
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:16,240
Okay, decide where we can eat.
I know a shop here...

913
01:04:16,360 --> 01:04:18,000
...called Only Sambar.
Shall we go there, sir?

914
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:18,960
...called Only Sambar.
Shall we go there, sir?

915
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:22,000
Dhal rice is famous here, sir.

916
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:23,720
Look at the crowd
even at this hour.

917
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:24,000
I buy food from here everyday.
–Do you pay?

918
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,160
I buy food from here everyday.
–Do you pay?

919
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:28,080
Sir, they won't accept it
even if I pay.

920
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:34,360
Sir, be seated, I'll get the food.
It's self service here.

921
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:36,000
I hope you will pay.
–I can't show off my charisma.

922
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,520
I hope you will pay.
–I can't show off my charisma.

923
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:54,000
How can all of you ask
at the same time?

924
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,600
How can all of you ask
at the same time?

925
01:04:55,720 --> 01:04:58,680
Stand in the queue, sir.
Sir, move aside. Please wait.

926
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:00,000
It smells good.
–Please wait, sir.

927
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,880
It smells good.
–Please wait, sir.

928
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:06,000
Who wants this?
Go and buy your lunch.

929
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:06,480
Who wants this?
Go and buy your lunch.

930
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:12,000
Sir, I'm not in the habit
of praying before eating.

931
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,160
Sir, I'm not in the habit
of praying before eating.

932
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:16,680
You can pray.
–Charge!

933
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:21,640
So, we didn't come here to eat?
Only to search?

934
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:29,840
Sir, the wash basin is outside.
You aren't allowed in here.

935
01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:34,120
Sorry, sir.

936
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:53,120
Where do you buy your dhal from?
–Sir, it is.....

937
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:54,000
Where do you buy your dhal from?

938
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,400
Where do you buy your dhal from?

939
01:05:56,080 --> 01:05:58,200
Where do you buy your dhal?
–Immanuel Agency.

940
01:05:58,320 --> 01:06:00,000
Don't tell him
–He already did.

941
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:00,240
Don't tell him
–He already did.

942
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:23,240
What do you mix in this?
–As mentioned on the label.

943
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:24,000
Ghee dhal.
–We are food safety officers.

944
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:27,040
Ghee dhal.
–We are food safety officers.

945
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:30,000
Tell me the truth.
–Officer?

946
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:30,600
Tell me the truth.
–Officer?

947
01:06:30,760 --> 01:06:33,640
Then I have to be honest.
We mix tallow.

948
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:35,360
That adds to the taste.

949
01:06:35,480 --> 01:06:36,000
Even your department
is well aware of this.

950
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:37,920
Even your department
is well aware of this.

951
01:06:38,040 --> 01:06:40,120
Wretched fools!
Have you been mixing tallow?

952
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:42,000
Everybody is claiming
it is finger–licking good!

953
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:42,880
Everybody is claiming
it is finger–licking good!

954
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:48,000
You claim it is ghee dhal,
but you mix tallow to it.

955
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:48,120
You claim it is ghee dhal,
but you mix tallow to it.

956
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:52,040
Isn't it wrong?
–What is wrong in that?

957
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:53,840
Where does ghee come from?
–Butter!

958
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:54,000
Hey!
–I said it's from butter.

959
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,200
Hey!
–I said it's from butter.

960
01:06:56,320 --> 01:07:00,000
We milk the cow, ferment it as curd
and extract butter from.....

961
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:00,760
We milk the cow, ferment it as curd
and extract butter from.....

962
01:07:01,040 --> 01:07:02,920
Why should I tell
all this to you?

963
01:07:03,040 --> 01:07:05,880
Take my usual grease I pay
your colleagues and clear out.

964
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:10,000
I'm not in the habit of taking.
I'm used to only giving!

965
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:15,800
How dare you touch me! Your next
destination is the hospital.

966
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:18,000
That is exactly
where we are heading!

967
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:19,960
Seal it!

968
01:07:49,360 --> 01:07:51,880
Wait, grandma.

969
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:05,640
Sorimuthu, can you see
the expiry date?

970
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:10,000
23–5–1983. The company
was opened on that date.

971
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:12,000
Unwanted details
are printed clearly.

972
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:12,880
Unwanted details
are printed clearly.

973
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:14,880
But the expiry date has been
deliberately blurred.

974
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,360
Bring the packet
and come with me.

975
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:24,000
Tell me this loaf's expiry date.
–Can't you read it yourself?

976
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,400
Tell me this loaf's expiry date.
–Can't you read it yourself?

977
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:28,440
It isn't clear.
Will you read it out for me?

978
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:30,000
Why are you disturbing me?

979
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:30,440
Why are you disturbing me?

980
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:32,040
It's printed there.
Why can't you check?

981
01:08:32,320 --> 01:08:35,080
That's his job!

982
01:08:35,200 --> 01:08:36,000
Why are you staring?
We are from food safety department.

983
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:37,640
Why are you staring?
We are from food safety department.

984
01:08:38,680 --> 01:08:42,000
Sir!

985
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:42,560
Sir!

986
01:08:43,440 --> 01:08:44,880
Good–for–nothing!

987
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,440
Are you blurring the expiry date
to mislead the public?

988
01:08:47,840 --> 01:08:48,000
All the packs
are the same, sir.

989
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,080
All the packs
are the same, sir.

990
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:54,000
Bread is the only item
poor patients can afford.

991
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:57,680
Bread is the only item
poor patients can afford.

992
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:00,000
Are your selling it
after it gets stale?

993
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,440
Are your selling it
after it gets stale?

994
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:04,840
Shelf life for a loaf of bread
is only 4 days.

995
01:09:05,400 --> 01:09:06,000
If consumed after 10 days,
what is the plight of the patient?

996
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:09,400
If consumed after 10 days,
what is the plight of the patient?

997
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:11,440
He will get admitted
into the same hospital again.

998
01:09:11,560 --> 01:09:12,000
Your business can flourish, right?
–No, sir.

999
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,120
Your business can flourish, right?
–No, sir.

1000
01:09:14,240 --> 01:09:16,000
Who is the canteen contractor?

1001
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:18,000
Sir?
–Who is this canteen's contractor?

1002
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:18,800
Sir?
–Who is this canteen's contractor?

1003
01:09:18,920 --> 01:09:21,880
Have you stuffed your mouth
with bread or what?

1004
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:24,000
The dean of this hospital, sir.

1005
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,680
The dean of this hospital, sir.

1006
01:09:27,360 --> 01:09:30,000
Don't point your finger at me.
I'll lose my job if you do, sir.

1007
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:30,200
Don't point your finger at me.
I'll lose my job if you do, sir.

1008
01:09:30,320 --> 01:09:32,720
Your job is not the only one
that will go for a toss!

1009
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:38,240
Muthu, are you in the venue?

1010
01:09:38,360 --> 01:09:40,240
Just as you instructed,
I'm in front of the factory.

1011
01:09:40,360 --> 01:09:42,000
Good, observe
if any vehicles are exiting.

1012
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:42,520
Good, observe
if any vehicles are exiting.

1013
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,840
Yes, sir. An Eicher van is leaving.
–Right, follow the vehicle.

1014
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:48,000
Okay, sir.

1015
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:48,720
Okay, sir.

1016
01:09:58,040 --> 01:10:00,000
Where are you?
–Sir, reached Porur from Ambattur.

1017
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:00,720
Where are you?
–Sir, reached Porur from Ambattur.

1018
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:03,600
Copy that, don't lose his trail.
Keep following him.

1019
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:07,720
Sir, the van
is crossing Velachery.

1020
01:10:08,680 --> 01:10:11,400
At this rate, looks like
he'll take me to Kanyakumari!

1021
01:10:12,120 --> 01:10:13,720
Muthu, don't lose him
for any reason.

1022
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:15,320
Keep following him.

1023
01:10:20,360 --> 01:10:22,960
Sir, the driver has turned
into a dump yard.

1024
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:24,000
Wait till the van
dumps the garbage.

1025
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:25,400
Wait till the van
dumps the garbage.

1026
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:30,000
I'm better off dumping garbage
with them than sticking with you.

1027
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:52,080
Sir, he drove away
after dumping the junk.

1028
01:10:52,200 --> 01:10:54,000
Sir, hello?
Phone switched off?

1029
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,360
Sir, hello?
Phone switched off?

1030
01:10:55,480 --> 01:10:58,720
He yells 'charge' wherever we go.
And doesn't charge his own mobile.

1031
01:10:58,840 --> 01:11:00,000
Muthu!
–I didn't say that.

1032
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,120
Muthu!
–I didn't say that.

1033
01:11:01,240 --> 01:11:04,000
The admin said so.
Next movement, sir.

1034
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:06,000
Sift through that garbage.
–Sir, I'm an officer.

1035
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,480
Sift through that garbage.
–Sir, I'm an officer.

1036
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:11,560
I'm your senior officer.
–Then let's do it together.

1037
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:24,000
Sir, why have they broken
the barrel like this?

1038
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:24,840
Sir, why have they broken
the barrel like this?

1039
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:26,800
This serves as water tank
in many households.

1040
01:11:26,920 --> 01:11:29,080
They store rice in my house.

1041
01:11:29,240 --> 01:11:30,000
This will easily fetch
Rs2000 to Rs3000.

1042
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:31,080
This will easily fetch
Rs2000 to Rs3000.

1043
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:33,360
That's my doubt too.

1044
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:47,040
Muthu, check if you can find
any other piece like this.

1045
01:11:57,760 --> 01:11:59,680
Sir, are you looking for this?

1046
01:12:09,160 --> 01:12:10,840
Formalin.

1047
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:12,000
Why does a food company
need formalin?

1048
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,560
Why does a food company
need formalin?

1049
01:12:13,680 --> 01:12:15,200
Muthu!
–I get it, sir.

1050
01:12:15,320 --> 01:12:17,880
Cutting! Cutting!
Brother, shall we share a cutting?

1051
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,760
90.
–Get lost.

1052
01:12:19,880 --> 01:12:21,320
95.
–Cutting?

1053
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:24,000
Want a cutting.....
–105. All gone in.

1054
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:24,640
Want a cutting.....
–105. All gone in.

1055
01:12:24,760 --> 01:12:26,680
Shut up!
–I won't zip my lips!

1056
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:28,600
Cutting?
–I won't let you close the shop.

1057
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:30,000
First zip the obvious!

1058
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:30,640
First zip the obvious!

1059
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:34,000
Look, we won't shut the shop
no matter who says it! Go!

1060
01:12:34,120 --> 01:12:36,000
That's what I want.
–Okay, go.

1061
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:37,560
That's what I want.
–Okay, go.

1062
01:12:38,360 --> 01:12:42,000
Cutting!
–Boss, I need a cutting too.

1063
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:42,120
Cutting!
–Boss, I need a cutting too.

1064
01:12:42,720 --> 01:12:44,360
Short by Rs10.
–Don't worry.

1065
01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:46,280
I was waiting for you.
–Thanks, boss.

1066
01:12:48,360 --> 01:12:50,080
Levying GST
even for chickpea salad?

1067
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:52,320
Our country is going to the dogs.
–Brother, do you know what GST is?

1068
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:54,000
You tell me.
–Goods and Services Tax.

1069
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:55,600
You tell me.
–Goods and Services Tax.

1070
01:12:55,720 --> 01:12:58,320
What does that mean?
–He gave us a bottle of booze.

1071
01:12:58,480 --> 01:13:00,000
Don't we tip him in appreciation?
–Yes.

1072
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:00,720
Don't we tip him in appreciation?
–Yes.

1073
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:03,600
That's Goods and Services Tax.
–You explained it brilliantly.

1074
01:13:03,720 --> 01:13:06,000
This is how it should be told.
No one knows to explain clearly.

1075
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:06,360
This is how it should be told.
No one knows to explain clearly.

1076
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:08,960
Right.
–Asset can be a penny less,...

1077
01:13:09,080 --> 01:13:10,920
...but booze is counted
to the last drop.

1078
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:12,000
Pour more booze for him, Muthu.

1079
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:13,560
Pour more booze for him, Muthu.

1080
01:13:13,680 --> 01:13:16,400
Only then he'll get high.
–Who are you, mister?

1081
01:13:16,720 --> 01:13:18,000
He'll keep you company
as of now.

1082
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:19,120
He'll keep you company
as of now.

1083
01:13:20,720 --> 01:13:24,000
Forget who I am.
Do you know who you are?

1084
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:24,360
Forget who I am.
Do you know who you are?

1085
01:13:24,720 --> 01:13:28,280
A microbiology student.
A gold medalist at that.

1086
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:30,000
You were paid Rs75,000
a month in a food product company.

1087
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:31,680
You were paid Rs75,000
a month in a food product company.

1088
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:33,960
If you want, you can easily afford
to drink in a five star hotel.

1089
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:36,000
But you trashed your job.

1090
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:36,440
But you trashed your job.

1091
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:39,080
You're begging for booze in front
of a liquor shop now.

1092
01:13:39,400 --> 01:13:42,000
Aren't you ashamed?
–How do you know about me, sir?

1093
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:42,640
Aren't you ashamed?
–How do you know about me, sir?

1094
01:13:47,960 --> 01:13:48,000
Of course I feel ashamed, sir,
to have worked for such a company.

1095
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:51,920
Of course I feel ashamed, sir,
to have worked for such a company.

1096
01:13:52,040 --> 01:13:53,600
Hard work and integrity
won't do, sir.

1097
01:13:53,720 --> 01:13:54,000
Your boss should uphold
these values.

1098
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:55,120
Your boss should uphold
these values.

1099
01:13:55,240 --> 01:13:57,960
Instead of working in that factory,
I'd rather sell my soul here.

1100
01:13:58,080 --> 01:14:00,000
In the food product factory
where you worked,...

1101
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,160
In the food product factory
where you worked,...

1102
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:03,920
...why do they need formalin?
–Not only formalin, sir.

1103
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:29,320
Sir, shall we settle the bill?
–Settle the bill.

1104
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:30,000
And seal the bar.

1105
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,880
And seal the bar.

1106
01:14:32,920 --> 01:14:35,000
When did this happen?

1107
01:14:40,680 --> 01:14:42,000
Goodness gracious!

1108
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:42,640
Goodness gracious!

1109
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:55,800
Excuse me,
stop right there.

1110
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:57,440
Who are you, sir?
How did you come here?

1111
01:14:57,560 --> 01:15:00,000
We took a right at Kannagi Statue
and 3rd left at the temple.

1112
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:00,120
We took a right at Kannagi Statue
and 3rd left at the temple.

1113
01:15:00,240 --> 01:15:02,720
Next?
–Food safety officers!

1114
01:15:03,680 --> 01:15:06,000
Is it your guest house
for you to visit every week?

1115
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:07,480
Is it your guest house
for you to visit every week?

1116
01:15:07,680 --> 01:15:10,480
You tested only last week,
you checked our milk...

1117
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:12,000
...and certified that
it is save for consumption.

1118
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:12,480
...and certified that
it is save for consumption.

1119
01:15:12,600 --> 01:15:15,640
What is your issue now?
Arun!

1120
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:18,000
This was given by AIIMS.
This certificate is from Pune.

1121
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,200
This was given by AIIMS.
This certificate is from Pune.

1122
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:22,640
And this was given
by your very own department.

1123
01:15:23,400 --> 01:15:24,000
If you have any other issue,
please contact your officers.

1124
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:25,120
If you have any other issue,
please contact your officers.

1125
01:15:25,240 --> 01:15:28,240
Not necessary at all.
Subramani!

1126
01:15:32,840 --> 01:15:35,000
Hey! Didn't I sack you?

1127
01:15:35,120 --> 01:15:36,000
Why are you here?
–He's here for a purpose.

1128
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:37,200
Why are you here?
–He's here for a purpose.

1129
01:15:37,320 --> 01:15:39,520
Sir!

1130
01:15:43,720 --> 01:15:47,240
Sir, I'll talk to my boss.

1131
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:54,000
Fool! The jammer is on.
Your call won't go through.

1132
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,440
Fool! The jammer is on.
Your call won't go through.

1133
01:15:56,960 --> 01:15:58,640
Didn't you hear
what I just said?

1134
01:15:58,760 --> 01:16:00,000
Subramani!
–Sir?

1135
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:00,720
Subramani!
–Sir?

1136
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:03,160
Sir, I need my boss' permission
to let you check these.

1137
01:16:03,280 --> 01:16:05,120
I'm very sorry.
–Muthu!

1138
01:16:05,240 --> 01:16:06,000
No one can leave
this factory until we know...

1139
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:07,280
No one can leave
this factory until we know...

1140
01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:10,520
...the adulterated components
in this milk. Get to it!

1141
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:18,000
Subramani, are you ready?
–Ready, sir.

1142
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:18,160
Subramani, are you ready?
–Ready, sir.

1143
01:16:18,280 --> 01:16:20,080
What is mixed in this milk?

1144
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:24,000
Melamine is mixed in this milk
to enhance protein content.

1145
01:16:24,200 --> 01:16:26,520
Melamine?
–Melamine is a chemical.

1146
01:16:26,720 --> 01:16:29,560
When a litre of milk
is diluted to 4 parts of water,...

1147
01:16:29,680 --> 01:16:30,000
...its protein level reduces.

1148
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:31,520
...its protein level reduces.

1149
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:35,440
To show more protein content,
melamine is mixed to the milk.

1150
01:16:35,560 --> 01:16:36,000
Next.

1151
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:37,080
Next.

1152
01:16:37,480 --> 01:16:39,880
They have mixed urea to improve
the density of milk, sir.

1153
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:42,000
That too,
twice the approved dosage.

1154
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,240
That too,
twice the approved dosage.

1155
01:16:44,680 --> 01:16:46,840
Normally, only 70 mg
is permissible in 100 ml.

1156
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:48,000
But this contains 200 mg, sir.
–Urea.

1157
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,560
But this contains 200 mg, sir.
–Urea.

1158
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:53,760
Urea shouldn't be used
even for crops.

1159
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:58,320
This is for consumption.....
What else is mixed?

1160
01:16:58,480 --> 01:17:00,000
Sir, caustic soda has been
mixed for viscosity.

1161
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,280
Sir, caustic soda has been
mixed for viscosity.

1162
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:06,000
You've mixed caustic soda in milk.
What will alcoholics do then?

1163
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:06,800
You've mixed caustic soda in milk.
What will alcoholics do then?

1164
01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:12,000
What is caustic soda?
Tell me.

1165
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:12,720
What is caustic soda?
Tell me.

1166
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:14,800
Detergent.

1167
01:17:14,920 --> 01:17:17,120
It is used for cleaning toilets
and rinsing clothes.

1168
01:17:18,360 --> 01:17:20,680
Are you mixing it in your milk
to get extra froth?

1169
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:23,440
Next!

1170
01:17:23,560 --> 01:17:24,000
Formalin is mixed as preservative
to this milk for longer shelf life.

1171
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:27,280
Formalin is mixed as preservative
to this milk for longer shelf life.

1172
01:17:28,520 --> 01:17:30,000
Formalin.

1173
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:30,480
Formalin.

1174
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:35,280
Formalin!

1175
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:38,520
Do you know what formalin
is used for?

1176
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:42,000
To embalm a body.

1177
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:42,640
To embalm a body.

1178
01:17:44,200 --> 01:17:46,600
It is fatal to even
sniff this chemical.

1179
01:17:47,560 --> 01:17:48,000
How dare you mix it in your milk
that is consumed by children.

1180
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,120
How dare you mix it in your milk
that is consumed by children.

1181
01:17:50,240 --> 01:17:52,760
Sir!
–Sir, on the whole,...

1182
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:54,000
...this isn't milk.
It's slow poison.

1183
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:54,360
...this isn't milk.
It's slow poison.

1184
01:17:54,480 --> 01:17:57,120
Milk is used
as a funerary ritual.

1185
01:17:57,240 --> 01:18:00,000
But you are preparing milk
to send people to an early grave!

1186
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:00,800
But you are preparing milk
to send people to an early grave!

1187
01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:30,000
Round up all of them.
–Hey! Stop!

1188
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:33,160
Round up all of them.
–Hey! Stop!

1189
01:18:34,280 --> 01:18:36,000
Hey! Stop!

1190
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:36,280
Hey! Stop!

1191
01:18:43,680 --> 01:18:45,840
Sir, don't!

1192
01:18:59,040 --> 01:19:00,000
At least now
do you realise, Jothi?

1193
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:01,080
At least now
do you realise, Jothi?

1194
01:19:01,200 --> 01:19:04,320
I want you to be able
to protect yourself.

1195
01:19:09,080 --> 01:19:10,920
Sir!

1196
01:19:11,200 --> 01:19:12,000
The evidence is safe, sir.

1197
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:13,040
The evidence is safe, sir.

1198
01:19:14,560 --> 01:19:17,080
I'll be in the office
in 10 minutes.

1199
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:28,040
Sir!

1200
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:30,000
Well done, my dear boy.
You've proved you are my junior.

1201
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:31,920
Well done, my dear boy.
You've proved you are my junior.

1202
01:19:32,040 --> 01:19:34,600
Public is only aware of the police,
law enforcement...

1203
01:19:34,720 --> 01:19:36,000
...and engineering departments.
But you've made people realise...

1204
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,880
...and engineering departments.
But you've made people realise...

1205
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
...the existence
of the food safety department.

1206
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:42,000
I hope you have all the proof.
–Allow me, sir.

1207
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,640
I hope you have all the proof.
–Allow me, sir.

1208
01:19:53,680 --> 01:19:54,000
His name is Mahadevan,
President of the Vendors' Union.

1209
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,120
His name is Mahadevan,
President of the Vendors' Union.

1210
01:19:56,240 --> 01:19:58,200
He is also President of the
Tamil Nadu Tea Shop Owners Union.

1211
01:19:58,320 --> 01:20:00,000
When we tested tea samples
from his shop,...

1212
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:00,520
When we tested tea samples
from his shop,...

1213
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:03,720
...we found opium
mixed in their tea.

1214
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:06,000
What is the source
of this tea with opium?

1215
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:09,560
Dinesh Menon, prominent tea estate
owner in Kerala.

1216
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:12,000
Only after a tea plant
grows for 10–12 years,...

1217
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:13,200
Only after a tea plant
grows for 10–12 years,...

1218
01:20:13,320 --> 01:20:15,600
...strength, flavour, taste
will be in the right proportion.

1219
01:20:15,720 --> 01:20:18,000
But if the same tea plant
is cultivated within 2–3 years...

1220
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:18,480
But if the same tea plant
is cultivated within 2–3 years...

1221
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:21,000
...and its leaves are plucked
as early as possible,...

1222
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:24,000
...strength, flavour and taste,
none of these will be present.

1223
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:24,080
...strength, flavour and taste,
none of these will be present.

1224
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:28,280
To ensure consumers get addicted
to a blend product,...

1225
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:30,000
...opium is mixed to it, sir.

1226
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:30,920
...opium is mixed to it, sir.

1227
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:33,400
Consuming it will lead
to medical complications.

1228
01:20:33,640 --> 01:20:36,000
Most importantly,
bowel cancer.

1229
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:36,440
Most importantly,
bowel cancer.

1230
01:20:38,480 --> 01:20:41,320
His name is Daniel Christopher,
the owner of Clean Water Company.

1231
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:42,000
6 litres of water per day can cure
40,000 diseases in your body.

1232
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:46,000
6 litres of water per day can cure
40,000 diseases in your body.

1233
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:48,000
But if you drink the pure drinking
water packed by this company,...

1234
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:48,520
But if you drink the pure drinking
water packed by this company,...

1235
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:50,480
...you'll get 4 million
new diseases.

1236
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:11,040
You won't see their water bottles
in all the stores.

1237
01:21:11,160 --> 01:21:12,000
You'll only find them in places
where large crowds commute.

1238
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:13,760
You'll only find them in places
where large crowds commute.

1239
01:21:14,440 --> 01:21:17,760
The address and other details
on these water bottles are fake.

1240
01:21:19,400 --> 01:21:21,520
He is Vikram Jeyaraj.

1241
01:21:21,640 --> 01:21:24,000
He's an influential businessman
in both private and public sectors.

1242
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:24,320
He's an influential businessman
in both private and public sectors.

1243
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:27,320
He is our health minister's
only brother.

1244
01:21:27,800 --> 01:21:30,000
He misuses the minister's influence
in a large scale.

1245
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:30,400
He misuses the minister's influence
in a large scale.

1246
01:21:30,920 --> 01:21:34,120
But his favourite business,
cooking oil.

1247
01:21:34,600 --> 01:21:36,000
Everyone is aware that
excess oil is bad for health.

1248
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,040
Everyone is aware that
excess oil is bad for health.

1249
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:39,440
But if his oil is used,
we found out that...

1250
01:21:39,560 --> 01:21:41,120
...consumer's lifespan
can be reduced significantly.

1251
01:21:41,240 --> 01:21:42,000
Reason being, it isn't even
refined oil, but recycled oil.

1252
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,720
Reason being, it isn't even
refined oil, but recycled oil.

1253
01:21:44,840 --> 01:21:48,000
Even if you use this oil for
50 times, the colour won't change.

1254
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:48,080
Even if you use this oil for
50 times, the colour won't change.

1255
01:21:48,200 --> 01:21:52,160
It will look like it is brand new,
because tar has been mixed to it.

1256
01:21:54,280 --> 01:21:56,200
There won't be any problem
if you use this oil just once.

1257
01:21:56,560 --> 01:21:58,440
But that happens
only in 5 star hotels.

1258
01:21:58,760 --> 01:22:00,000
We tracked this oil
after the first usage.

1259
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,280
We tracked this oil
after the first usage.

1260
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:42,000
It makes its way
to all the tea stalls.

1261
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:42,160
It makes its way
to all the tea stalls.

1262
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:47,400
Oh no!
–Other than cooking oil...

1263
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:48,000
...he has another major business,
poultry farm.

1264
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:49,800
...he has another major business,
poultry farm.

1265
01:22:50,480 --> 01:22:51,960
He has almost 50 acres of land.

1266
01:22:52,480 --> 01:22:54,000
It takes about 3–4 months for
a chicken to be bred to maturity.

1267
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:55,720
It takes about 3–4 months for
a chicken to be bred to maturity.

1268
01:22:56,080 --> 01:23:00,000
Only then it is healthy.
But the birds in his farm...

1269
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:00,600
Only then it is healthy.
But the birds in his farm...

1270
01:23:00,720 --> 01:23:03,040
...are injected with
an antibiotic called colistin.

1271
01:23:03,160 --> 01:23:06,000
In just 48 days,
they grow up to 3 kilos.

1272
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:06,200
In just 48 days,
they grow up to 3 kilos.

1273
01:23:06,320 --> 01:23:10,560
This abnormal breeding leads to
many medical complications.

1274
01:23:10,680 --> 01:23:12,000
If young girls consume them,...

1275
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:12,680
If young girls consume them,...

1276
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:16,080
...they will attain puberty
by 7–10 years of age.

1277
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:18,000
Not knowing
what is happening,...

1278
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:19,960
Not knowing
what is happening,...

1279
01:23:20,080 --> 01:23:23,240
...they are subjected to periods
every month and in the end,...

1280
01:23:23,360 --> 01:23:24,000
...they get cancer
in their uterus.

1281
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:25,640
...they get cancer
in their uterus.

1282
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:29,840
Their next business, 
most essential commodity, milk.

1283
01:23:29,960 --> 01:23:30,000
I have evidence and details
of the milk adulteration...

1284
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:31,600
I have evidence and details
of the milk adulteration...

1285
01:23:31,720 --> 01:23:33,360
...done by them, sir.

1286
01:23:33,480 --> 01:23:36,000
Based on that, I sealed their main
production plant yesterday.

1287
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:36,040
Based on that, I sealed their main
production plant yesterday.

1288
01:23:36,160 --> 01:23:37,800
Then there is hybrid banana
that never gets spoilt,...

1289
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:40,440
...apples that are polished,...
wax coated paper cups,...

1290
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:42,000
...steamed idli in plastic films,
dog's meat passed off as mutton.

1291
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,120
...steamed idli in plastic films,
dog's meat passed off as mutton.

1292
01:23:44,240 --> 01:23:46,680
The list is endless, sir.
Gone are the days...

1293
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:48,000
...when we thought 'food is
medicine and medicine is food'.

1294
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:49,680
...when we thought 'food is
medicine and medicine is food'.

1295
01:23:49,800 --> 01:23:53,680
We are consuming bad food
and frequenting pharmacies.

1296
01:23:55,000 --> 01:24:00,000
I'll abolish adulteration.
Cancer!

1297
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:00,400
I'll abolish adulteration.
Cancer!

1298
01:24:00,520 --> 01:24:04,200
Cancer is no longer a disease.
It's a business!

1299
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:06,000
That is why
I sealed those firms.

1300
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:07,440
That is why
I sealed those firms.

1301
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:09,400
I'm saying this
out of my experience, Jagan,...

1302
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:12,000
...I've never seen
such an honest officer like you.

1303
01:24:12,120 --> 01:24:15,560
We shouldn't let any of them go.
Let these firms be sealed.

1304
01:24:16,280 --> 01:24:18,000
I'll produce the culprits
in court and take...

1305
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:18,160
I'll produce the culprits
in court and take...

1306
01:24:18,280 --> 01:24:20,320
...whatever legal action required.

1307
01:24:20,440 --> 01:24:22,400
Give me whatever evidence
you've collected.

1308
01:24:22,520 --> 01:24:24,000
Why, sir?

1309
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:24,400
Why, sir?

1310
01:24:24,520 --> 01:24:26,600
So you can hand it over
to the concerned people?

1311
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:36,000
Just by sniffing, I can say if
a product is adulterated or pure.

1312
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,320
Just by sniffing, I can say if
a product is adulterated or pure.

1313
01:24:38,640 --> 01:24:42,000
You are my senior officer.

1314
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:42,320
You are my senior officer.

1315
01:24:42,440 --> 01:24:44,280
I can judge
by just looking at your face.

1316
01:24:45,560 --> 01:24:47,960
Having sealed so many
firms and stores,...

1317
01:24:48,080 --> 01:24:50,440
...I was wondering why I never
received a single call from you.

1318
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:53,760
Not even the slightest resistance
from the wrong doers puzzled me.

1319
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:58,800
Then I came to know that
you are hand in glove with them.

1320
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:00,000
You wanted me to hand over
all the evidences to you?

1321
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,840
You wanted me to hand over
all the evidences to you?

1322
01:25:04,920 --> 01:25:06,000
I showed this video to you because
I thought you would change...

1323
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:07,160
I showed this video to you because
I thought you would change...

1324
01:25:07,280 --> 01:25:12,000
...after seeing these evidences.
Even now, if you don't change,...

1325
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:12,400
...after seeing these evidences.
Even now, if you don't change,...

1326
01:25:12,520 --> 01:25:15,440
...I'm sorry to say this, sir,
no one can save you either.

1327
01:25:16,560 --> 01:25:18,000
Try to save yourself
if you can, you moron!

1328
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:18,920
Try to save yourself
if you can, you moron!

1329
01:25:40,080 --> 01:25:42,000
None of you will change, right?

1330
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:42,320
None of you will change, right?

1331
01:25:54,720 --> 01:25:56,160
What?

1332
01:25:56,280 --> 01:25:58,480
Being educated and an officer,
you thought I won't hit you?

1333
01:25:58,600 --> 01:26:00,000
What do you want?
You're torturing us for no reason.

1334
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,080
What do you want?
You're torturing us for no reason.

1335
01:26:02,200 --> 01:26:04,360
You have all gathered
at the right venue.

1336
01:26:04,840 --> 01:26:06,000
You'd better surrender.

1337
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:06,520
You'd better surrender.

1338
01:26:06,640 --> 01:26:10,080
As soon as they knew it was
my firm, the officers got scared.

1339
01:26:10,200 --> 01:26:12,000
Do you know why?
Because they all have families.

1340
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:13,400
Do you know why?
Because they all have families.

1341
01:26:13,520 --> 01:26:17,480
You don't have a family.
That is why you are fearless.

1342
01:26:18,320 --> 01:26:21,080
But you are still breathing.
–I'm not bothered about that.

1343
01:26:21,200 --> 01:26:24,000
Let me repeat, you'd better accept
your crime and surrender.

1344
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:25,160
Let me repeat, you'd better accept
your crime and surrender.

1345
01:26:25,400 --> 01:26:27,880
Or your new generation will consume
the same poison...

1346
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
...you're manufacturing.
Our generation won't consume it.

1347
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:31,560
...you're manufacturing.
Our generation won't consume it.

1348
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:33,240
But they will force it down
people's throat!

1349
01:26:33,360 --> 01:26:35,040
Today, this commissioner.
Tomorrow, supreme court judge.

1350
01:26:35,640 --> 01:26:36,000
State and central ministers
support us.

1351
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,040
State and central ministers
support us.

1352
01:26:38,160 --> 01:26:41,000
We'll fling such cases
and walk away.

1353
01:26:41,120 --> 01:26:42,000
You can fling your case.
Even if you do so,...

1354
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,760
You can fling your case.
Even if you do so,...

1355
01:26:44,880 --> 01:26:47,720
...the video I've uploaded on
WhatsApp about you is trending now.

1356
01:26:47,840 --> 01:26:48,000
I've broken the trust
people had in your product.

1357
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,120
I've broken the trust
people had in your product.

1358
01:26:50,240 --> 01:26:52,760
This isn't the first time
such a video has gone viral online.

1359
01:26:53,320 --> 01:26:54,000
People will view and forward it,
no one will follow up on it.

1360
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:57,320
People will view and forward it,
no one will follow up on it.

1361
01:26:57,480 --> 01:27:00,000
Even if you find faults with
my business and seal my company,...

1362
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:01,880
Even if you find faults with
my business and seal my company,...

1363
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:03,640
...I'll start another company
under a different name...

1364
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:06,000
...in the same building.
I'll change my logo.

1365
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:06,560
...in the same building.
I'll change my logo.

1366
01:27:06,680 --> 01:27:09,680
I'll change my packaging.
I'll change the colour inside.

1367
01:27:09,800 --> 01:27:11,800
I'll advertise differently.

1368
01:27:11,920 --> 01:27:12,000
I'll make people buy
my product all over again.

1369
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:13,680
I'll make people buy
my product all over again.

1370
01:27:14,120 --> 01:27:16,920
The same product which you claimed
was adulterated...

1371
01:27:17,040 --> 01:27:18,000
...would still be intact.
–Or,...

1372
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:19,480
...would still be intact.
–Or,...

1373
01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:21,640
...we'll showcase a big board
claiming it is organic.

1374
01:27:21,760 --> 01:27:24,000
We'll make people pay extra
Rs10 to vie and buy our product.

1375
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:24,320
We'll make people pay extra
Rs10 to vie and buy our product.

1376
01:27:24,440 --> 01:27:25,880
That won't work
as long as I'm here.

1377
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,240
As long as people are unable
to curb their desires,...

1378
01:27:28,360 --> 01:27:30,000
...everything will happen.
–This is wrong, Daniel.

1379
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:30,760
...everything will happen.
–This is wrong, Daniel.

1380
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:33,200
You are mixing poison in food
to satisfy your greed.

1381
01:27:33,320 --> 01:27:36,000
First accept you are wrong.
–What is wrong?

1382
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:37,760
First accept you are wrong.
–What is wrong?

1383
01:27:37,880 --> 01:27:41,680
We have caught, roasted
and eaten mice from the fields.

1384
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:42,000
Today people have
a varied fare of chicken 65,...

1385
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:43,440
Today people have
a varied fare of chicken 65,...

1386
01:27:43,560 --> 01:27:46,920
...chicken tikka
and chicken burger.

1387
01:27:47,040 --> 01:27:48,000
People who had idli and dosa
only for Deepavali and Pongal...

1388
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:51,120
People who had idli and dosa
only for Deepavali and Pongal...

1389
01:27:51,240 --> 01:27:53,760
...have access
to tasty dishes daily.

1390
01:27:53,880 --> 01:27:54,000
As soon as they wake up,...

1391
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:55,400
As soon as they wake up,...

1392
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:57,880
...people who had rice porridge
and diluted millet stew...

1393
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
...are consuming
different energy powders.

1394
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:01,240
...are consuming
different energy powders.

1395
01:28:01,360 --> 01:28:04,800
They mix it in different colours
and drink them with my milk.

1396
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:06,000
This is growth. Milk was consumed
only by the rich before.

1397
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,920
This is growth. Milk was consumed
only by the rich before.

1398
01:28:09,040 --> 01:28:12,000
But today, even a homeless person
can buy a milk packet for Rs10.

1399
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:13,720
But today, even a homeless person
can buy a milk packet for Rs10.

1400
01:28:13,840 --> 01:28:15,640
If you want
all walks of life to benefit,...

1401
01:28:15,760 --> 01:28:18,000
...adulteration is the only answer.
India's population is 1.32 billion.

1402
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:19,720
...adulteration is the only answer.
India's population is 1.32 billion.

1403
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:21,760
Is it possible to give
pure stuff to everyone?

1404
01:28:21,880 --> 01:28:24,000
One who was starving yesterday
is eating well and is happy today.

1405
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:24,640
One who was starving yesterday
is eating well and is happy today.

1406
01:28:24,760 --> 01:28:28,200
Instead of eating quality food
and living up to 80,...

1407
01:28:28,320 --> 01:28:30,000
...let him eat what he likes.
And die happily at 40.

1408
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:31,880
...let him eat what he likes.
And die happily at 40.

1409
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:33,840
What's your problem?

1410
01:28:33,960 --> 01:28:35,520
I'll put a full stop to this
once and for all.

1411
01:28:35,640 --> 01:28:36,000
I'll educate people
about adulteration.

1412
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,480
I'll educate people
about adulteration.

1413
01:28:38,600 --> 01:28:40,760
If we let you go today,
100 others will follow you.

1414
01:28:40,880 --> 01:28:42,000
Tomorrow it will increase to 1,000.
So, you must die.

1415
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:43,480
Tomorrow it will increase to 1,000.
So, you must die.

1416
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:47,240
Even now, betel leaf seller
to department store owners...

1417
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:48,000
...are waiting for you to die.

1418
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:49,760
...are waiting for you to die.

1419
01:28:49,880 --> 01:28:51,360
Send him outside,
we'll handle you.

1420
01:28:51,480 --> 01:28:54,000
Send him out,
I'll kill him.

1421
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:54,720
Send him out,
I'll kill him.

1422
01:28:55,520 --> 01:28:57,080
Did you hear that?

1423
01:28:57,200 --> 01:28:59,440
You will meet your end
only in our hands.

1424
01:29:00,360 --> 01:29:02,400
Why waste time talking?
Bash him and kill him.

1425
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
Don't spare him!
Finish him!

1426
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:07,840
Don't spare him!
Finish him!

1427
01:31:39,760 --> 01:31:42,000
Jagan, quick.

1428
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:42,080
Jagan, quick.

1429
01:31:50,160 --> 01:31:51,560
Nab him!

1430
01:31:51,680 --> 01:31:54,000
Start the car.
Let's go.

1431
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:54,120
Start the car.
Let's go.

1432
01:32:03,680 --> 01:32:05,560
Why are you making
mistake after mistake?

1433
01:32:06,200 --> 01:32:08,800
Is it wrong to ask them
not to add poison in our food?

1434
01:32:08,920 --> 01:32:11,520
Yes, it's wrong.
Because no one is ignorant.

1435
01:32:11,640 --> 01:32:12,000
People are aware it is poison.

1436
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:13,320
People are aware it is poison.

1437
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:15,600
He sells the poison
and gives a remedy for it too.

1438
01:32:15,720 --> 01:32:17,160
It is the same person.

1439
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:18,000
Why is everyone consuming and
keeping quiet about it?

1440
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:18,880
Why is everyone consuming and
keeping quiet about it?

1441
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:20,680
It's a question of survival.

1442
01:32:21,640 --> 01:32:23,600
100 people came today,
tomorrow 400 will show up.

1443
01:32:23,720 --> 01:32:24,000
Will you hit everyone?
–Of course I will.

1444
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,080
Will you hit everyone?
–Of course I will.

1445
01:32:26,480 --> 01:32:28,840
Look, those culprits
who followed us are waiting...

1446
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:30,000
...at the next station to kill you.
What do you plan to do?

1447
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,080
...at the next station to kill you.
What do you plan to do?

1448
01:32:34,480 --> 01:32:36,000
I'm advising you to stay away.

1449
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:36,160
I'm advising you to stay away.

1450
01:32:36,280 --> 01:32:38,400
Show me a place
without adulteration.

1451
01:32:39,360 --> 01:32:41,760
I'll back off.
–Such a place doesn't exist!

1452
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:45,560
Listen, even for a good deed,
you need at least 4 people.

1453
01:32:45,680 --> 01:32:48,000
I'll be the first good Samaritan
in that handful.

1454
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:48,080
I'll be the first good Samaritan
in that handful.

1455
01:32:48,200 --> 01:32:51,600
The other 3 won't show up.
You'll be the first and last.

1456
01:32:51,720 --> 01:32:54,000
Unadulterated food
is my dream and desire.

1457
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:55,000
Unadulterated food
is my dream and desire.

1458
01:32:55,120 --> 01:32:58,240
It will never get fulfilled.
Listen to me.

1459
01:32:58,360 --> 01:33:00,000
A good life is waiting for you.

1460
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:00,120
A good life is waiting for you.

1461
01:33:00,240 --> 01:33:02,560
Marry Jothi and
settle down in life.

1462
01:33:02,680 --> 01:33:04,800
Trying to convince me
using love as a bait?

1463
01:33:04,920 --> 01:33:06,000
More than my feelings
for that girl,...

1464
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:07,200
More than my feelings
for that girl,...

1465
01:33:07,320 --> 01:33:10,800
...I love my job 100 times more.

1466
01:33:10,920 --> 01:33:12,000
Jagan, please don't take this path.
Listen to me.

1467
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,880
Jagan, please don't take this path.
Listen to me.

1468
01:33:15,120 --> 01:33:18,000
Change your decision.
This isn't good for any of us.

1469
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:18,680
Change your decision.
This isn't good for any of us.

1470
01:33:25,680 --> 01:33:28,640
You too?
–We can live together.

1471
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:30,000
But we can't die together.
Jagan, if you don't die,...

1472
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:31,920
But we can't die together.
Jagan, if you don't die,...

1473
01:33:32,040 --> 01:33:34,440
...they have threatened
to kill my wife and child.

1474
01:33:36,840 --> 01:33:40,040
I died the moment
you took the knife out.

1475
01:33:40,840 --> 01:33:42,000
You are this orphan's mother.

1476
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:43,160
You are this orphan's mother.

1477
01:33:49,800 --> 01:33:52,240
I have to die
to appease all of you.

1478
01:33:53,960 --> 01:33:54,000
I'm someone who believes
in unadulterated food.

1479
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,840
I'm someone who believes
in unadulterated food.

1480
01:33:56,960 --> 01:33:59,520
Will I allow adulteration
in my death?

1481
01:34:02,400 --> 01:34:06,000
Even now I'm saying,
my death is not in their hands.

1482
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:07,600
Even now I'm saying,
my death is not in their hands.

1483
01:34:09,400 --> 01:34:12,000
They will breathe their last
only in my hands.

1484
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:12,640
They will breathe their last
only in my hands.

1485
01:34:32,160 --> 01:34:36,000
Unadulterated food
is my dream.

1486
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:37,760
Unadulterated food
is my dream.

1487
01:34:48,760 --> 01:34:51,400
Hello!

1488
01:34:51,800 --> 01:34:54,000
Where?

1489
01:34:54,120 --> 01:34:55,880
Okay, I'll handle it.

1490
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,440
Turn around.
–Okay, brother.

1491
01:35:11,400 --> 01:35:12,000
Check if he is alive or dead.

1492
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:13,800
Check if he is alive or dead.

1493
01:35:22,720 --> 01:35:24,000
Pour petrol and burn him.
Throw his remains into the sea.

1494
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:25,720
Pour petrol and burn him.
Throw his remains into the sea.

1495
01:35:48,960 --> 01:35:52,720
To fulfil my goals,
I've given up my life.

1496
01:35:54,920 --> 01:35:58,360
Those 3 rogues turned food
into poison to line their pockets.

1497
01:35:58,480 --> 01:36:00,000
I used you to kill them.

1498
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:01,160
I used you to kill them.

1499
01:37:07,320 --> 01:37:09,240
Guards!

1500
01:37:44,600 --> 01:37:48,000
Tell me now.
What I did is right, am I correct?

1501
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:48,040
Tell me now.
What I did is right, am I correct?

1502
01:37:48,600 --> 01:37:51,480
Wrong! Grave blunder!

1503
01:37:51,600 --> 01:37:53,440
How can you take away
someone's life?

1504
01:37:53,560 --> 01:37:54,000
The law will punish criminals.
–Law won't touch them, Jothi.

1505
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:57,560
The law will punish criminals.
–Law won't touch them, Jothi.

1506
01:37:57,680 --> 01:38:00,000
Am I the pawn?

1507
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:00,320
Am I the pawn?

1508
01:38:00,440 --> 01:38:03,320
I'm someone who believes
I shouldn't kill even an insect.

1509
01:38:03,440 --> 01:38:06,000
That is why I possessed your body.
You are me, I am you!

1510
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,440
That is why I possessed your body.
You are me, I am you!

1511
01:38:08,560 --> 01:38:12,000
You think like me.
–Whatever you say,...

1512
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:12,320
You think like me.
–Whatever you say,...

1513
01:38:12,440 --> 01:38:15,960
...you cannot justify your action.
–What do you want me to do now?

1514
01:38:16,080 --> 01:38:18,000
Go away from me.
–No, I won't.

1515
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:18,920
Go away from me.
–No, I won't.

1516
01:38:19,480 --> 01:38:21,280
2 more criminals
are yet to be punished.

1517
01:38:21,400 --> 01:38:24,000
I won't allow you to use me
to kill one more person.

1518
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:24,440
I won't allow you to use me
to kill one more person.

1519
01:38:25,160 --> 01:38:28,360
I hate myself
for I fell in love with you.

1520
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:30,000
You should not leave this place.

1521
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:30,800
You should not leave this place.

1522
01:38:31,080 --> 01:38:35,480
If you think of killing
one more person, I'll kill myself.

1523
01:38:35,600 --> 01:38:36,000
I swear.

1524
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:37,880
I swear.

1525
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:39,720
Don't be hasty, Jothi.
Listen to me.

1526
01:38:40,120 --> 01:38:42,000
One who mixes poison in food today
will do the same to medicines too.

1527
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:43,600
One who mixes poison in food today
will do the same to medicines too.

1528
01:38:43,960 --> 01:38:46,280
We should not let them
go scot–free.

1529
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:48,000
You'll have a tough time
without me, Jothi.

1530
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:49,720
You'll have a tough time
without me, Jothi.

1531
01:38:51,400 --> 01:38:54,000
Don't leave me here and go, Jothi.
Listen to me.

1532
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:54,560
Don't leave me here and go, Jothi.
Listen to me.

1533
01:39:17,800 --> 01:39:18,000
If you have guts, face me.
–Don't you know who I am?

1534
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:21,920
If you have guts, face me.
–Don't you know who I am?

1535
01:39:22,160 --> 01:39:24,000
Food Safety officer,
Jagannathan.

1536
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:24,800
Food Safety officer,
Jagannathan.

1537
01:39:29,080 --> 01:39:30,000
Cool, partner, cool.

1538
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:31,240
Cool, partner, cool.

1539
01:39:31,360 --> 01:39:34,960
If he was human, we can hunt him
down and hack him to pieces.

1540
01:39:35,280 --> 01:39:36,000
But he's now a spirit.
We must deal with it differently.

1541
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,640
But he's now a spirit.
We must deal with it differently.

1542
01:39:38,760 --> 01:39:40,800
Let me take care of that.

1543
01:39:53,760 --> 01:39:54,000
Sandhya, isn't Teacher Jothi
working today?

1544
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:55,400
Sandhya, isn't Teacher Jothi
working today?

1545
01:39:55,520 --> 01:39:57,560
I don't know.
I think she is on leave.

1546
01:39:57,680 --> 01:39:59,560
How sad!
I lost an egg.

1547
01:39:59,680 --> 01:40:00,000
Madam, you forgot
to serve me egg.

1548
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:01,720
Madam, you forgot
to serve me egg.

1549
01:40:04,040 --> 01:40:05,600
It is good.

1550
01:40:16,360 --> 01:40:18,000
God, what a world we live in!

1551
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,040
God, what a world we live in!

1552
01:40:21,320 --> 01:40:23,880
We can't trust
the current generation.

1553
01:40:24,840 --> 01:40:28,640
I mean Jagan. When he came
to our house the other day,...

1554
01:40:28,760 --> 01:40:30,000
...he claimed to be a good man,
has integrity and a martyr.

1555
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:31,120
...he claimed to be a good man,
has integrity and a martyr.

1556
01:40:31,560 --> 01:40:33,480
Only when you bond with him,
his true colours flash.

1557
01:40:33,600 --> 01:40:35,520
All rotten apples
in the barrel.

1558
01:40:35,720 --> 01:40:36,000
That day, he vouched
you are the only girl for him.

1559
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,760
That day, he vouched
you are the only girl for him.

1560
01:40:38,880 --> 01:40:42,000
Now when I asked him, he said
he has been offered a job abroad.

1561
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:43,240
Now when I asked him, he said
he has been offered a job abroad.

1562
01:40:43,360 --> 01:40:45,120
Work versus you,
he prefers his work!

1563
01:40:45,240 --> 01:40:47,000
He'll go abroad,
then he'll look into it.

1564
01:40:47,120 --> 01:40:48,000
When will he come back
and marry you?

1565
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:49,160
When will he come back
and marry you?

1566
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:52,000
This won't work.

1567
01:40:52,960 --> 01:40:54,000
This is what you get if you talk
to someone who is no more, dad.

1568
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:55,680
This is what you get if you talk
to someone who is no more, dad.

1569
01:40:56,920 --> 01:40:59,440
Jothi?
–Jagan is dead.

1570
01:40:59,560 --> 01:41:00,000
I knew even before
you found out.

1571
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,360
I knew even before
you found out.

1572
01:41:06,160 --> 01:41:08,560
Hello!
–Madam, come here at once.

1573
01:41:08,680 --> 01:41:10,440
I don't know what to do.

1574
01:41:10,560 --> 01:41:12,000
All the kids have been
rushed to the hospital.

1575
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:13,320
All the kids have been
rushed to the hospital.

1576
01:41:14,520 --> 01:41:17,360
Doctors are
being noncommittal, madam.

1577
01:41:21,320 --> 01:41:24,000
The children fainted
one after another.

1578
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:24,600
The children fainted
one after another.

1579
01:41:38,680 --> 01:41:40,160
In a government higher secondary
school in T. Nagar,...

1580
01:41:40,280 --> 01:41:41,840
...students fainted
all of a sudden.

1581
01:41:41,960 --> 01:41:42,000
The kids who are fighting for
their lives have been admitted...

1582
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:43,680
The kids who are fighting for
their lives have been admitted...

1583
01:41:43,800 --> 01:41:45,280
...in the government hospital.

1584
01:41:45,400 --> 01:41:48,000
Doctors are treating them
in the emergency ward.

1585
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:48,160
Doctors are treating them
in the emergency ward.

1586
01:41:48,280 --> 01:41:51,720
Doctors have reported
that their condition is critical.

1587
01:42:05,920 --> 01:42:06,000
Nothing to worry.
Stay strong.

1588
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,280
Nothing to worry.
Stay strong.

1589
01:42:08,400 --> 01:42:12,000
Doctor, please take a look.

1590
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:12,160
Doctor, please take a look.

1591
01:42:12,400 --> 01:42:15,240
Doctor.

1592
01:42:17,720 --> 01:42:18,000
Doctor, what happened?

1593
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:21,880
Doctor, what happened?

1594
01:42:26,720 --> 01:42:28,760
What is it, doctor?

1595
01:42:28,880 --> 01:42:30,000
I'll become a renowned doctorwhen I grow up, teacher.

1596
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:30,680
I'll become a renowned doctorwhen I grow up, teacher.

1597
01:42:30,800 --> 01:42:34,520
Only then, those who are disabledlike me will have renewed faith.

1598
01:42:40,200 --> 01:42:42,000
I'll study well,I'll earn lots of money.

1599
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:43,000
I'll study well,I'll earn lots of money.

1600
01:42:43,120 --> 01:42:45,440
I'll distribute foodto many people, teacher.

1601
01:42:46,360 --> 01:42:48,000
My daughter has passed away.

1602
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:48,840
My daughter has passed away.

1603
01:42:50,840 --> 01:42:53,720
Sandhya, how could you
leave me like this?

1604
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:58,880
My dearest daughter, you were
our only hope for the future.

1605
01:43:01,120 --> 01:43:04,040
Teacher, I'll study well andbecome a good teacher like you.

1606
01:43:07,080 --> 01:43:08,760
Vanakkam.
Today's breaking–news.

1607
01:43:08,880 --> 01:43:11,040
In a government higher secondary
school in T. Nagar,...

...10 students are unconscious
and 5 dead.

1609
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:13,160
...10 students are unconscious
and 5 dead.

1610
01:43:13,560 --> 01:43:16,120
The reason, inferior ice cream
sold outside the school.

1611
01:43:16,240 --> 01:43:18,000
The ice cream seller
has been arrested.

1612
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:19,560
The ice cream seller
has been arrested.

1613
01:43:19,680 --> 01:43:22,680
Here are details from the health
minister regarding this matter.

1614
01:43:22,800 --> 01:43:24,000
This is a tragic
incident indeed.

1615
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:24,360
This is a tragic
incident indeed.

1616
01:43:24,480 --> 01:43:26,840
We are following proper
safety measures within the school.

1617
01:43:26,960 --> 01:43:30,000
This is mainly due to consumption
of inferior products from vendors.

1618
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:30,200
This is mainly due to consumption
of inferior products from vendors.

1619

to the deceased...

1620
01:43:31,920 --> 01:43:33,440

01:43:33,560 --> 01:43:35,240
This is the compensation
announced by the government.

1622
01:43:36,280 --> 01:43:38,160
Following this.....
–Did you see that?

1623
01:43:38,280 --> 01:43:41,240
Those wretched culprits
have manipulated the case.

1624
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:45,120
Students didn't faint
because of the ice cream.

1625
01:43:45,960 --> 01:43:48,000
They fainted after eating the eggs
from the meal scheme.

1626
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:49,800
They fainted after eating the eggs
from the meal scheme.

1627
01:43:50,280 --> 01:43:52,720
Only kids who ate the eggs
fainted one after another.

1628
01:43:52,840 --> 01:43:54,000
Those who didn't eat
those eggs are fine.

1629
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,560
Those who didn't eat
those eggs are fine.

1630
01:43:58,440 --> 01:44:00,000
These doctors accepted bribe
without a twinge of remorse.

1631
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:00,960
These doctors accepted bribe
without a twinge of remorse.

1632
01:44:01,080 --> 01:44:04,320
They have twisted the case.

1633
01:44:07,880 --> 01:44:10,600
Who is Murthy's father?
Sign and take the body.

1634
01:44:10,720 --> 01:44:12,000
Stop! Don't claim
their bodies.

1635
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:13,720
Stop! Don't claim
their bodies.

1636
01:44:13,840 --> 01:44:16,560
Your child didn't die
because of the ice cream.

1637
01:44:16,800 --> 01:44:18,000
They died after eating the eggs
from the free meal scheme.

1638
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:18,920
They died after eating the eggs
from the free meal scheme.

1639
01:44:19,240 --> 01:44:21,200
Let us fight until we get justice.

1640
01:44:21,320 --> 01:44:23,800
Madam, when have we
won anything by protesting?

1641
01:44:24,280 --> 01:44:27,080
If we protest,
will my child come back alive?

1642
01:44:27,680 --> 01:44:30,000
How can you say this?
This is a crime.

1643
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:30,680
How can you say this?
This is a crime.

1644
01:44:30,800 --> 01:44:32,520
Don't we have to question them?

1645
01:44:32,640 --> 01:44:34,400
You are saying
it should be questioned.

1646
01:44:34,520 --> 01:44:36,000
We were paid Rs500,000
to keep our mouths shut.

1647
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,840
We were paid Rs500,000
to keep our mouths shut.

1648
01:44:39,280 --> 01:44:42,000
My daughter died and
has repaid all my loans.

1649
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:43,400
My daughter died and
has repaid all my loans.

1650
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:45,160
I had a disabled child.

1651
01:44:45,280 --> 01:44:48,000
I was worried
how I was going to raise him.

1652
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:48,080
I was worried
how I was going to raise him.

1653
01:44:48,480 --> 01:44:52,360
But today he has given his life
and settled me well in life, madam.

1654
01:44:52,760 --> 01:44:54,000
I have no other choice
but to accept this...

1655
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:55,200
I have no other choice
but to accept this...

1656
01:44:55,320 --> 01:44:57,240
...as my fate
and sign the papers.

1657
01:44:57,360 --> 01:44:59,960
Murthy, my son!

1658
01:45:06,880 --> 01:45:11,120
Murthy!

1659
01:45:11,360 --> 01:45:12,000
What's happening here, sir?
–For the lives created by God,...

1660
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,520
What's happening here, sir?
–For the lives created by God,...

1661
01:45:14,640 --> 01:45:16,440
...the government
has fixed the price.

1662
01:45:16,720 --> 01:45:18,000
What can we do?
–Even you have given up?

1663
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,320
What can we do?
–Even you have given up?

1664
01:45:21,120 --> 01:45:24,000
We can only correct papers.
We can't change these rogues.

1665
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:25,960
We can only correct papers.
We can't change these rogues.

1666
01:45:26,160 --> 01:45:30,000
We can't do it.
–Are you the doctor or am I?

1667
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:31,360
We can't do it.
–Are you the doctor or am I?

1668
01:45:31,480 --> 01:45:34,240
If you're educated,
you'll keep questioning everything.

1669
01:45:34,360 --> 01:45:36,000
I'm a qualified doctor.
You're a 5th Grade teacher.

1670
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:37,360
I'm a qualified doctor.
You're a 5th Grade teacher.

1671
01:45:37,520 --> 01:45:40,120
I know when and how
to certify things.

1672
01:45:40,240 --> 01:45:42,000
Parents have agreed.
What's your problem?

1673
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:42,160
Parents have agreed.
What's your problem?

1674
01:45:42,800 --> 01:45:44,680
Instead of preaching to me,
attend to your work.

1675
01:45:44,800 --> 01:45:48,000
I know where to go
and whom to meet.

1676
01:47:50,320 --> 01:47:53,920
Thank God!
Only now I feel relieved.

1677
01:47:55,120 --> 01:47:58,200
Confine and destroy him.

1678
01:48:04,240 --> 01:48:05,920
You are free
of all hassles hereafter.

1679
01:48:06,040 --> 01:48:09,960
Hereafter, your problems
are resolved.

1680
01:48:10,280 --> 01:48:12,000
Don't think so and feel glad.

1681
01:48:12,120 --> 01:48:15,400
Bad souls
can be destroyed easily.

1682
01:48:15,600 --> 01:48:18,000
To destroy good souls,
we need time.

1683
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:19,800
To destroy good souls,
we need time.

1684
01:48:20,800 --> 01:48:22,560
Tomorrow,...

1685
01:48:22,680 --> 01:48:24,000
...only until the sun sets,...

1686
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,240
...only until the sun sets,...

1687
01:48:26,360 --> 01:48:29,640
...he will be under my control.

1688
01:48:29,760 --> 01:48:30,000
If you don't want any problem,...

1689
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:34,600
If you don't want any problem,...

1690
01:48:34,720 --> 01:48:36,000
...with whichever body he's trying
to take revenge on you,...

1691
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:40,080
...with whichever body he's trying
to take revenge on you,...

1692
01:48:40,200 --> 01:48:42,000
...you must find that body,...

1693
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:45,720
...you must find that body,...

1694
01:48:45,840 --> 01:48:48,000
...burn it and dilute
the ashes in a gutter.

1695
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,000
...burn it and dilute
the ashes in a gutter.

1696
01:48:51,680 --> 01:48:54,000
The biggest blunder you did was
to dump his ashes in the sea.

1697
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,080
The biggest blunder you did was
to dump his ashes in the sea.

1698
01:48:56,880 --> 01:49:00,000
It has changed into a pure soul
and is taking revenge against you.

1699
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:00,400
It has changed into a pure soul
and is taking revenge against you.

1700
01:49:00,720 --> 01:49:04,480
Bring that girl, burn her
and mix her ashes in the gutter.

1701
01:49:04,760 --> 01:49:06,000
Without a body
like hers to possess,...

1702
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:07,480
Without a body
like hers to possess,...

1703
01:49:07,600 --> 01:49:10,120
...his soul will decay.

1704
01:49:10,400 --> 01:49:12,000
What you have to find now
is that girl.

1705
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:15,000
What you have to find now
is that girl.

1706
01:49:24,880 --> 01:49:27,160
I've told you it isn't possible.
Why are you still waiting?

1707
01:49:27,280 --> 01:49:29,680
I got the lab report stating
those eggs were adulterated.

1708
01:49:29,800 --> 01:49:30,000
What's this, madam?

1709
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:31,280
What's this, madam?

1710
01:49:31,400 --> 01:49:34,240
The doctor certified those kids
died because of the ice cream.

1711
01:49:34,360 --> 01:49:36,000
A case has been filed and the ice
cream vendor has been arrested.

1712
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:37,840
A case has been filed and the ice
cream vendor has been arrested.

1713
01:49:37,960 --> 01:49:40,320
Even the health minister
has given an interview.

1714
01:49:40,440 --> 01:49:42,000
You are bringing
an inconsequential lab report...

1715
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:42,680
You are bringing
an inconsequential lab report...

1716
01:49:42,800 --> 01:49:44,520
...and you're pestering me
at this hour.

1717
01:49:44,640 --> 01:49:47,320
What can I do? Even if I take
the case, it won't stand a chance.

1718
01:49:47,440 --> 01:49:48,000
How can you talk this way too?

1719
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,120
How can you talk this way too?

1720
01:49:50,240 --> 01:49:52,280
All the victims
were innocent children.

1721
01:49:53,040 --> 01:49:54,000
I know they can't be
revived or resurrected.

1722
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:55,280
I know they can't be
revived or resurrected.

1723
01:49:55,400 --> 01:49:58,760
But shouldn't the true cause
of death be revealed to the world?

1724
01:49:58,880 --> 01:50:00,000
What is it you want?
You want the truth revealed. Right?

1725
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:01,600
What is it you want?
You want the truth revealed. Right?

1726
01:50:01,800 --> 01:50:03,920
Give it to me.

1727
01:50:07,040 --> 01:50:09,560
Whoever comes,
the truth will never be known.

1728
01:50:49,760 --> 01:50:51,600
What's the need to poke
your nose like this?

1729
01:50:51,720 --> 01:50:53,520
Your lover is already dead.

1730
01:50:53,640 --> 01:50:54,000
Instead of grieving at a corner and
crying to your heart's content...

1731
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,600
Instead of grieving at a corner and
crying to your heart's content...

1732
01:50:56,720 --> 01:51:00,000
...and being a good teacher,
why are you torturing us?

1733
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:00,360
...and being a good teacher,
why are you torturing us?

1734
01:51:00,840 --> 01:51:05,000
No, sir.
–He'll come as a spirit.

1735
01:51:05,120 --> 01:51:06,000
She'll give her body
as a host to the spirit.

1736
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:07,240
She'll give her body
as a host to the spirit.

1737
01:51:07,360 --> 01:51:10,600
Are you taking revenge as a team?
Come here!

1738
01:51:22,160 --> 01:51:24,000
Jagan, what you did is right.

1739
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:26,840
Jagan, what you did is right.

1740
01:51:28,560 --> 01:51:30,000
What I did is wrong.

1741
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,280
What I did is wrong.

1742
01:51:34,560 --> 01:51:36,000
Where are you, Jagan?

1743
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:36,480
Where are you, Jagan?

1744
01:51:37,680 --> 01:51:40,280
Come!

1745
01:51:41,960 --> 01:51:42,000
Douse petrol on her.

1746
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:43,920
Douse petrol on her.

1747
01:52:32,200 --> 01:52:35,200
You said unadulterated food
is your dream.

1748
01:52:35,760 --> 01:52:36,000
Because of them,
5 innocent kids died.

1749
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:39,920
Because of them,
5 innocent kids died.

1750
01:52:40,640 --> 01:52:42,000
I don't want another life
to be taken.

1751
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:45,040
I don't want another life
to be taken.

1752
01:52:45,160 --> 01:52:47,560
Snuff the lives out
of these monsters.

1753
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:53,840
Kill them!

1754
01:52:58,240 --> 01:53:00,000
Set her on fire!

1755
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:00,760
Set her on fire!

1756
01:53:29,480 --> 01:53:30,000
Move aside!

1757
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:31,720
Move aside!

1758
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:54,000
How many times
will you set fire to me?

1759
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:56,120
How many times
will you set fire to me?

1760
01:54:22,240 --> 01:54:24,000
Partner, how did he.....

1761
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:25,360
Partner, how did he.....

1762
01:55:05,040 --> 01:55:06,000
Jesus Christ, our savior,
You have to save us.

1763
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:07,320
Jesus Christ, our savior,
You have to save us.

1764
01:55:07,440 --> 01:55:09,440
Please save me
from this devil.

1765
01:55:09,560 --> 01:55:11,880
My Lord!

1766
01:56:26,400 --> 01:56:29,680
From now on, I'll make sure
no one harms you, Jothi.

1767
01:56:57,160 --> 01:56:59,520
Partner! Come on!

1768
01:57:10,400 --> 01:57:12,000
Help!

1769
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:18,000
Help! Partner!

1770
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:19,320
Help! Partner!

1771
01:57:42,880 --> 01:57:47,760
Help! Please, help!

1772
01:57:47,880 --> 01:57:48,000
Spare me!

1773
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,480
Spare me!

1774
01:57:50,720 --> 01:57:53,400
Please don't kill me!

1775
01:57:54,640 --> 01:57:57,040
Die!

1776
01:57:58,120 --> 01:58:00,000
People who adulterate food
should die only like this.

1777
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:01,520
People who adulterate food
should die only like this.

1778
01:58:01,840 --> 01:58:04,760
Let me go, please!

1779
01:58:05,320 --> 01:58:06,000
If I spare you,...

1780
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:07,480
If I spare you,...

1781
01:58:07,600 --> 01:58:10,280
...heartless brutes who bite
your mother who nurses you...

1782
01:58:10,400 --> 01:58:12,000
...won't hesitate to adulterate
even mother's milk!

1783
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:12,480
...won't hesitate to adulterate
even mother's milk!

1784
01:58:14,040 --> 01:58:16,480
Help! Spare me please!

1785
01:58:16,600 --> 01:58:18,000
Every cigarette packet
warns the smoker...

1786
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:18,680
Every cigarette packet
warns the smoker...

1787
01:58:18,800 --> 01:58:20,440
...that if one smokes,
one may die of cancer.

1788
01:58:21,120 --> 01:58:22,600
Every liquor bottle
carries the same warning...

1789
01:58:22,840 --> 01:58:24,000
...that it is injurious
to the home and nation.

1790
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:25,000
...that it is injurious
to the home and nation.

1791
01:58:26,240 --> 01:58:28,160
Don't kill me.
–If the same warning...

1792
01:58:28,280 --> 01:58:30,000
...should not get featured
as labels on all grocery items...

1793
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:30,280
...should not get featured
as labels on all grocery items...

1794
01:58:30,400 --> 01:58:35,480
...and even on the milk sachets
children drink.....

1795
01:58:36,480 --> 01:58:38,560
Please,  let me go!

1796
01:58:38,680 --> 01:58:42,000
You should not even exist
on earth.

1797
01:58:53,560 --> 01:58:54,000
Don't, please let me go!

1798
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:55,840
Don't, please let me go!

1799
01:58:55,960 --> 01:58:58,160
You are evil
to your home and nation,...

1800
01:58:58,280 --> 01:59:00,000
...I'll write this
on your tombstone!

1801
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:00,960
...I'll write this
on your tombstone!

1802
01:59:20,280 --> 01:59:24,000
Jagan's hunt againstadulteration will continue...

1803
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:25,120
Jagan's hunt againstadulteration will continue...

1804
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:27,440
Shot okay!
