1
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,880
After high school, I'm not
gonna pursue my education,

2
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,160
I've decided to marry a foreign groom.

3
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:23,880
India is a boring country.

4
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,840
If I fall in love with someone

5
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,720
My grandma will thrash me

6
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:34,600
I'll marry whomever my grandma selects
and settle down with him

7
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:49,720
Sheer stupidity, my dad
behaved so arrogant and weird

8
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,320
He assumes everyone as womaniser
in that field [Film making]

9
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,320
There are womanisers in every field

10
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,720
Yeah, we see them in our office too

11
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,080
I took extensive measures to
convince my family for this marriage

12
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,320
God! I'm so relieved

13
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,480
But, you got to be courageous
to take this decision

14
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,560
Forget it, Why do you have
to cry on a festive day

15
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,320
He doesn't mind even
if it's a festive day

16
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,200
I just kept him informed about the customs

17
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,120
For that he is scolding
me in front of everyone

18
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,000
I am humiliated in front of my relatives.

19
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:34,480
Everyone knows about him, don't get
yourself into trouble now for being late

20
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,960
Apart from marriage,
Don't you have any ambitions?

21
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,920
Yes I do

22
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,400
Love to be a mom for 3 kids

23
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,720
Buy a house and always
romanticising with my husband

24
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,120
Just like in the movies,
hugging and kissing frequently

25
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,080
Very passionate about each other

26
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,600
Then you would have to marry Tom Cruise

27
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,680
Even a Dicaprio or Brad Pitt is not bad

28
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,720
Fools, are you mocking me

29
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:04,760
Just wait, I'll find a guy who is a
right mixture of all three actors.

30
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:09,280
I can't lead a template life of getting
married and giving birth to a child

31
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,960
I have many ambitions

32
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,360
His specs is in that cupboard

33
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,400
Don't forget to take it

34
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,640
Rain looks beautiful,
Shall we get drenched?

35
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,800
Love to, but I'm afraid we'll get drenched

36
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,120
Mutually supporting each other and
we should move on

37
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,480
It would be an interesting
and challenging life

38
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,440
It's got to be

39
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,680
If you keep crying, Everyone might
notice, go freshen up yourself

40
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,960
That's right!

41
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,520
I've been going through the
same all these years...

42
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,640
What a song, isn't it bro?

43
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,800
Raja is evergreen

44
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,400
Leave that!

45
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,120
You've rocked bro

46
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,680
For all those who cheat in the name of
Tamilans, Your movie is a slippering

47
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,760
What a making?

48
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,480
If a DVD could
give me this feel,

49
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:00,200
imagine how awesome it would be if
watched in a proper theatre

50
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,400
The slippering is not gonna change

51
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:06,240
The Atmos sound won't be a kick with a boot

52
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,600
Why are you tensed?

53
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,840
Then what?

54
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:13,600
I'm tensed whether the producer
would release the film,

55
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,360
And he is telling it looks awesome in TV...
Theatre and stuff

56
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,840
Sir, all I got is a DVD

57
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,320
This is my movie

58
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,840
I too have to see it on DVD

59
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Varun sir, saw your movie
It was awesome

60
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,400
Need a snap...

61
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,320
Sir, Can you take a snap?

62
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,800
Arul sir, Arul sir
Can we take a snap with you too

63
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,920
No!
No thanks!

64
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,040
And it's very very dangerous

65
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,520
It's been years sir, When is
your next film set for release?

66
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,520
In the website I read
about some issues.

67
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,200
You saw it right? you heard the news,
Then why do you ask me?

68
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,520
I don't know when
the movie would release

69
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,920
I don't know if it would release,
Is this enough?

70
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:07,160
What are you going to do?
Are you gonna mourn to death?

71
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,160
Go drink!

72
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,360
Goddess sculptures have a better
price tag in the smuggling market

73
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:18,560
In Tamil Nadu all those sculptures which
aren't popular as well not under maintenance,

74
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:25,080
Are easily smuggled and sold out for
a huge price by a certain group

75
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:30,360
Mostly It takes months for even people to
realise those sculptures have been smuggled.

76
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:35,280
Such smuggled sculptures in Tamil Nadu
alone would worth up to a few millions

77
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,200
The main reason behind this is
In our temples,

78
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,960
Mostly these sculptures are been deserted
without knowing their worth,

79
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:47,560
And left alone as a stand alone stone
without proper maintenance.

80
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:53,440
But those who realised the worth of it,
especially those foreign museums and those riches

81
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,760
are buying it out for huge
prices in the black market.

82
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:01,600
(Singing a peppy song)

83
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,200
- That's a glamour song?
- Who said glamour song is not an art?

84
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,280
A movie must emote the people

85
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,160
It must make them think

86
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,160
And should entertain a bit

87
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:20,600
But your movies are pure
sensual massage parlours

88
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:26,480
Each one who watches it,
will experience a sensual pleasure

89
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,800
Is that right sir?

90
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,680
Fact! Fact!

91
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,760
Massage with happy endings only

92
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:42,440
Soapy massage with happy endings only

93
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:50,040
Cheta texted, They have gathered
thugs and are waiting outside.

94
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,480
Does he have such contacts?

95
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,880
Not much

96
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,480
He is just a friend of local
politician's brother in law

97
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,200
What shall we do?

98
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,960
Yeah Jegan?

99
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,000
What happened?

100
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,680
I'll be there in 10 minutes

101
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,200
Looks like a big issue

102
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,600
Does he have no other Job?
Always getting into trouble

103
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,240
Their family has fed us for generations,
I have to go immediately

104
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,520
I've fed you a lot too,
Am I not your boss?

105
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,920
Yes Of course

106
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,440
Marry me!
You will be my boss?

107
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,200
Oh my God!

108
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,480
Always cribbing around
marriage like an oldie

109
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,920
What else should I say?

110
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,720
what should I do?

111
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,560
Keep the romantic mood intact

112
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,440
I'll be back soon

113
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,680
I got to leave bye

114
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:29,320
This is nothing to do with love,
He was disturbing the class, so he hit him

115
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,480
Got it

116
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,480
You got us here for your kiddish problems

117
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,160
He had hit him because he
was disturbing the class

118
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,680
- What!
- He has been inviting trouble for a while

119
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,640
We must hit him for sure

120
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,720
Don't create a fuss

121
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,680
I got to hit him

122
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,680
Are you guys coming here
or the other way

123
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,800
Are you not ashamed to gather
thugs for such an issue?

124
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,440
If you have the guts let's
have a one on one fight

125
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,240
If not, I need time to gather my guys

126
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,680
Are you ready for a one on one fight?

127
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,320
Alone!
Let's go together and finish them

128
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,960
Shut up!

129
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,200
Let's give him some time,
else it will not be a fair play

130
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,960
Let them!

131
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:15,080
Director fell in love with the Heroine,
Lucky director

132
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,680
What's it?

133
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,360
A small quarrel near Jegan college

134
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,840

00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:52,960
You saw my performance and
appreciated me over the mic

178
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,680
- In that boat
- Yes

179
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,240
- What happened to your hair?
- Tonsuring for God

180
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,320
Sir remembers me

181
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,960
Let that be Why did you try to hit
my brother? - We didnt know that sir

182
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,600
He has brought us here to hit sir's brother

183
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,080
Go and apologies idiot

184
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:15,680
Apologise Do apologise idiot
- Just leave him

185
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,520
A small request

186
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,320
I did ask then I sing well

187
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,880
I'm learning Carnatic music
Shall I sing

188
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,600
Give me a chance in your next film

189
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:32,080
They term it commercial if there is a song

190
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,160
You got drinks
- Yes

191
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,560
Sing!

192
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:52,080
One Two Three Four
Five Six Larges are boring

193
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:56,440
Watch me leap to the Eighth round
Right away!

194
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:19,560
Got myself a demon
Holding onto me tightly!

195
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:24,360
When there are doubts cropping up
I wash them down with what I drink!

196
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:27,760
It's trying to wake up
my sleeping conscience

197
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,480
It's trying to pull it out and beat it down

198
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:37,040
And then
It laughs and mocks at me

199
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:42,720
And then it tries to suck my life!

200
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:47,000
What a waste, this bottle!
What a taste, this bottle!

201
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,440
What a taste, this bottle!
What a ghost, this bottle!

202
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:14,720
Everything was going well
With the ride of my life

203
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:19,320
I don't know what it hit
Now I have broken wheels!

204
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:23,960
I should be on the top of
Good for nothing list!

205
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:28,640
Adding fuel to fire
There goes the demon, laughing!

206
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:32,480
It's trying to wake up
my sleeping conscience

207
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:36,880
It's trying to pull it out and beat it down

208
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:41,720
And then
It laughs and mocks at me

209
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:47,120
And then it tries to suck my life!

210
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,120
Would you like to have coffee?

211
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,680
- Is he drunk?
- Yes

212
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:58,880
Yazhu

213
00:17:59,080 --> 00:17:59,760
Sweetheart

214
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,760
Who is that?

215
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,720
Dad

216
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:07,760
Mommy, Daddy is here

217
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:13,600
- Good night darlings
- Daddy is saying goodnight now.

218
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,600
Uncle

219
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,360
- Bye Uncle
- Bye Dolly

220
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,720
- He doesn't listen to me
- Bye

221
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,400
- Grandpa, Bye
- Bye Dear

222
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,360
Had your coffee?

223
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,440
No uncle, I've packed food for aunt,

224
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,480
Let's go Mommy

225
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,320
Sorry Dear

226
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,160
Mommy why are you silent?

227
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,920
Don't you have sense, You are
partying with him all night

228
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:35,160
Don't blame me uncle, he
isn't a kid to instruct

229
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,560
Your father was an alcoholic,

230
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,000
And Lost his life due to it

231
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,040
I am worried, he too
might face the same fate.

232
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,480
My dad is a different breed,

233
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,840
Boozing has been his life.

234
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,800
But for my brother it's
just out of frustration

235
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,120
Once his film releases,
then only weekend parties

236
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,600
Hello Sir, What's the
menu for today's lunch?

237
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,760
Chicken Pizza with pepperoni
toppings, wanna have some

238
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,600
Why??

239
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:19,600
Are you gonna let us feed chicken
and meat, It's the same porridge

240
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,640
It's for her better health

241
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,240
One minute.

242
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:27,800
Why do you need a special ward when
she can be taken care at home?

243
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:32,480
We strongly believe that her
recovery relies on your hospital

244
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,080
So much love from the old man

245
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:38,000
It's just his guilt for being
so arrogant in the past

246
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:41,120
but once she's bedridden, he realised

247
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,000
and now showering his
love during these final days.

248
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,840
Dear, You came early today

249
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,320
Has Dolly gone for
her music class?

250
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,200
You were drinking now, weren't you?

251
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:06,240
No way, just hangover from
yesterday, you know what...

252
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:20,120
Wow dear, You are Sherlock Holmes...

253
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,800
- Are you going to die, are you?
- Listen to me

254
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:30,960
Arul

255
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,600
I am drinking just to escape death

256
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,280
I am helpless!!

257
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,600
Arul

258
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,600
My last resort is to kill
the producer with this gun

259
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:49,280
Sometimes, I want to kill
him and shoot myself

260
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,320
Do you want that to happen?

261
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,440
Enough

262
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,840
Please move on

263
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,800
Go ahead with your work

264
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,080
Work on your next script

265
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,600
Shoot your next movie

266
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,400
I can't

267
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,320
When you were pregnant

268
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:17,800
If I had asked you to keep her aside and go
for an another kid, how would you feel?

269
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,880
My situation is similar to that

270
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:23,720
I can't

271
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,600
I'm sorry dear, Sorry!

272
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,760
I prefer one of these elephants really

273
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,760
What do you want?

274
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,960
We are looking for statue of elephant

275
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,680
Yeah elephant statue...
- Elephant??

276
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,360
Jegan, the details are here,

277
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:55,680
This catalog has all the sculpture
details your dad made after 1974,75

278
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:00,040
The design, order invoices and
all other information are here

279
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:04,280
I started working with
your father since 1974

280
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,360
I have recorded everything after that..

281
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,720
But my brother is
working since 1964

282
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:14,680
But he never brings these catalogs home,
as his wife is an orthodox christian

283
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,760
Uncle, These details are more than
enough for my college assignment

284
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,000
Don't start off with your
boring lectures

285
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,600
Boring lectures??? you have no
idea about your father's skills..

286
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:27,520
He is the only Tamil sculptor awarded
with Bharat Kala Ranjan award

287
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:30,680
I dunno what honour you are
gonna bring to this family

288
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:59,680
Thought you are here to pickup the
delivery, But you doesn't seem to be..

289
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:02,200
Recently I've heard about it,
But have you been an accomplice

290
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,880
Yeah, just twice

291
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,560
It's not a risky job, we
have guys to execute it

292
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:10,760
I've got an idea,
Can we try once?

293
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:14,080
I know a mediator who can get us
the foreign contracts

294
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:17,280
Ensure you prepare an order invoice
for those foreign contracts

295
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:21,600
Don't quote more than Rs.300,000,
20% is my commission

296
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:23,920
What's this all about?

297
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,480
Why do we have to steal our own sculptures?

298
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,120
You can put it that way,

299
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:31,120
else you can say those sculptures
crafted by our ancestors,

300
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:35,040
will be sent to those places
where those will be of prime importance

301
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,400
Don't confuse me

302
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,560
Forget it!

303
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:44,360
We'll make huge money,
I'll give you Rs.300,000

304
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:46,840
- Rs.300,000!!!

305
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:49,160
Uncle and Dad shouldn't
know about this

306
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:54,800
you needn't worry about it,
Get to the point

307
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:58,480
So, this is our plan

308
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:03,400
Padlock, Pressing and other locks
can be easily handled with tools

309
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:07,720
This is Temple Lock, needs lot of energy
and have to compromise my moral values

310
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,720
It would cost around 40 thousand

311
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,080
What the hell?

312
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,200
I'll pay you both 100,000 rupees

313
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,280
Complete the task

314
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,680
Just 100,000... only..
I need to buy lots of equipments

315
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,960
First, I need gloves, in white colour

316
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,320
I need shades, Ray Ban

317
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,600
Idiots, it's a night robbery

318
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,560
Unlock it within 2 minutes

319
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,360
Am I James bond to unlock within 2 minutes

320
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:59,520
I've never seen such locks, I think it
will take a while to unwrap this cloth

321
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,760
Damn old dirty cloth

322
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,560
- How did you unlock it quickly?
- It is open already

323
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,160
Too much of hype
for this old lock

324
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,360
I'm scared,
What if we get damned?

325
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,760
Shut up and get in

326
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,640
God earns respect only
if humans worship them

327
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,600
There are goats grazing here

328
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:23,840
This is the statue

329
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:25,720
Unlock this

330
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,960
I don't think it's a big deal

331
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:35,000
- Call Senthil now
- I told you it's not a big deal

332
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,280
Is everything alright bro?

333
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,680
There is no work for us,
all gates are opened already

334
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,800
I know you will be wearing those
shades, just get rid of it

335
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:47,760
Hang up!

336
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,080
Ramesh..Ramesh

337
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,840
Little bit louder please,
So that everyone wakes up

338
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,600
Remove your shades else I'll slap you

339
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:01,720
- Do it right?
- This is no big deal

340
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,160
- Hi
- Hey Mr.Noble

341
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,920
Just stop and don't turn back

342
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,480
- What?
- Just close your eyes

343
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:30,000
Have you got flowers and sweets?
Shall I bring hairpin?

344
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,440
Good joke, just turn

345
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,000
How is it?

346
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,480
Diamond?

347
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,400
- How did you get money?
- I earned it, how is it?

348
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:45,000
It looks great, I don't need this
- Just wear it please...

349
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,120
I just don't need this

350
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:55,320
I am earning enough to manage my needs.

351
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:58,080
Do I look like I sleep
with you for these things?

352
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,600
Don't talk rubbish

353
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,160
Then why all this?

354
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,560
because...

355
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,520
I love you..

356
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,360
I want to marry you..

357
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,200
Why are we both consorting each other

358
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,480
Love, Pure love

359
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,680
Stupidity

360
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:30,040
Not that, it's just for
the three letter word

361
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,160
Ka-dha-Il (love) It's three letters right

362
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:37,400
Not that, I am not supposed to say it

363
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:42,240
If a girl utters, it's a
mistake, It's a bad word here

364
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:44,920
We just did that...

365
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,200
Matter (Sex)

366
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,920
Ma - It - ta - Ir ( Sex)
it is four letters

367
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,560
Ok let's keep it to be a 4 letter word

368
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,040
Our relationship is only about that

369
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:03,960
My love life ended when my
husband Jeeva passed away

370
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:09,040
So this is just for that
3 letter word S-E-X

371
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:13,040
This marriage, love, diamond...

372
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,640
I don't need any of these...

373
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,040
- Got it?
- I don't

374
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:28,080
Let's just Fuck

375
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,440
Dear...!

376
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:40,640
I never got anything till date for Aunt

377
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,880
So I bought her a necklace,
that too a fake one

378
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:46,000
- Uncle..Uncle... Uncle!!!
- I'll kill you

379
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:49,200
- Who is that girl?
- Don't peek into my space

380
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,280
- Your Space!!!
- Ok..Ok fine,

381
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,520
Let me explain,
Wait... Wait...

382
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,880
I will explain, wait.

383
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,400
Let me speak

384
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:03,280
Malar, Malarvizhi, My Love.

385
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:07,240
Malarvizhi, Love?
Just like your uncle

386
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,680
Talk to Malar and get
her consent for marriage

387
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:17,360
I've never said that I love
him or wanna marry him

388
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,120
I got married to my true love Jeeva

389
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:24,760
My husband

390
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,480
He was my world, we were living happily.

391
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,440
Suddenly a business loss

392
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,920
Coward, he killed himself

393
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:36,240
After him, I thought that
was my end of my life

394
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,840
It's been 6 years
Now everything is normal

395
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,080
Certain things..like..

396
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:45,880
How can I say, like..

397
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:49,480
- Like everyone, I had my own
desires as well - Hey Malar..

398
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:52,280
- Uncle, it's not what you think
- Your thought process is right

399
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:54,760
Because of that we found
company in each other

400
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,240
Apart from that Michael
is a good friend of mine

401
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:00,160
Find a good bride for him

402
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,440
I won't be in touch with Michael anymore,

403
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,760
Do have coffee,
It's getting cold...

404
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:07,200
You could've have picked
someone else for your desires

405
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,400
Someone who is of your kind

406
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,600
- Uncle, Uncle..
- Let me Speak

407
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,760
Why did you pick such an
innocent virgin guy

408
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:16,680
Malar..

409
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,200
You have a great sense of humour uncle

410
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,040
Are you serious?
Were you an innocent Virgin guy?

411
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:30,160
Uncle, You are still in 19th century.

412
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:33,400
You can never think my way, So
you will never understand, Uncle.

413
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,200
You will surely say that I'm a bitch

414
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,680
Bye uncle

415
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,160
Hey, Why you said all these?

416
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,800
I just told the truth...

417
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,600
Get married soon

418
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:55,800
Uncle..uncle... uncle... she may talk
like this, but she is a very good girl..

419
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:59,080
I love her so much, please do
convince her for this marriage

420
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,160
Convince her..

421
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:07,760
We like the girl, let's fix the wedding
date. We will take care of all the expenses

422
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:12,760
Thank God, at last we found a right
match for our boy. Hope all goes well.

423
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,040
He looks good

424
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,920
Not just good he's handsome

425
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:21,040
Not just handsome he looks smart as well

426
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:24,600
Is he the mixture of
Dicaprio and Brad Pitt

427
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:30,040
The chimes of the temple lead us to the holy abode

428
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:34,760
Hymns of joy amidst chimes of love!

429
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:40,160
Honeymoon times are filled with love

430
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:45,040
Flowers of love blossoms on the barren land

431
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:56,840
King of smiles falls for the love laced eyes
His gaze expresses new meanings

432
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:02,160
The heart pounds to express the feel

433
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:07,600
The doors of love opened leisurely

434
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:12,840
A bride uttered the golden words
She is an angel on earth indeed

435
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:17,960
Love culminates in ecstasy

436
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:22,600
- What is this drink?
- Brewed in-house.

437
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:37,320
The bride and groom are made for each other
Long live for a hundred years!

438
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:42,920
The bride and groom are made for each other
Long live for a hundred years!

439
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:47,760
May you get all the blessing
Of a good matrimony!

440
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:52,800
May you get all the blessing
Of a good matrimony!

441
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:57,800
Embrace with love
And welcome the newborn!

442
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:02,560
Embrace with love
And welcome the newborn!

443
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:08,360
Share every last wish of your heart
Live long achieving your wishes!

444
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:11,400
Share every last wish of your heart
Live long achieving your wishes!

445
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:15,280
Share every last wish of your heart
Live long achieving your wishes!

446
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,040
Long live! Long live!

447
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:39,240
Michael is also my brother,
we are always there for him

448
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:40,520
Ok, Come

449
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:46,760
Michael should live happily
with his wife and children

450
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:47,840
He will be..

451
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,920
He has already started
the process to make kids

452
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:52,200
The moment he entered the room,
the lights went OFF!

453
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,040
Stop it guys.

454
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:59,120
Guys, Let's wrap it. Arul, you
got to leave early tomorrow.

455
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,960
Don't worry dear, it's just
the marriage hangover

456
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:06,360
Yeah, It's Michael's marriage
hangover, we are enjoying it.

457
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:10,000
The lights are ON,
Success!

458
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:19,160
Arul, enough... leave... leave now

459
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,600
Nothing..

460
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,600
Do you smoke a lot?

461
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:53,880
Look, I was just forced into this marriage.

462
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:57,520
So, I can never be a man of your dreams

463
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:00,320
If you can accept this,
then let's live together.

464
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:21,120
He would say such things,
You have to convince him.

465
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,280
Men are men at the end of the day

466
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:25,040
It's our responsibility to change them.

467
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:27,120
Usually that's what marriage does.

468
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:30,400
Yes dear, I struggled a lot
to convince your grandpa,

469
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:32,920
Your mom too had a
struggle with your father

470
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,600
Ponni, don't delay it further,

471
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,600
quickly get him on track

472
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:41,520
It was too late in my case as he
passed away the day he realized.

473
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:46,040
Hey, What's so funny about it?

474
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:48,760
Just shut up!

475
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:53,040
Rain! Ilayaraja!
Super Right!

476
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:06,080
Do you like rain?
Shall we drench in the rain?

477
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:09,600
My shirt is getting wet,
Shut that window

478
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,120
Hey Driver

479
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,440
Change that song

480
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,920
This song is dedicated to Viveks team

481
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:45,680
wow..Ilaiyaraja is always the King of Music

482
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,200
No one can compete with him

483
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:54,640
Today,

484
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:58,360
We will have 4 pegs and leave, that's it
- OK bro

485
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:04,000
Our Director Vivek's movie
is a box office hit

486
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:09,040
So we are gonna party the whole
night to celebrate this success

487
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,760
I would invite director
Vivek to speak a few words

488
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,960
This is my first film

489
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:23,880
It's only because of all your handwork,
this movie is a box office hit

490
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:30,280
Big hit, Box office hit!
He's bragging too much

491
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,160
When was it released?

492
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,920
Last Friday and had a good run for a week

493
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,760
One week? Then he can show off

494
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:40,600
We can't even find a way
to release our movie

495
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:44,040
- But still, he is talking a lot, isn't it?
- Kind of bro

496
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,000
Hello Hello...

497
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:50,040
This movie has stunned the audience,

498
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:54,960
Including the old veteran directors,
upcoming directors and others...

499
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:55,720
Can I have some pickles

500
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,840
have learnt their lessons from this film.

501
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,720
That's how the critics look at it as well

502
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,880
It's start of new age cinema and

503
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:08,320
We are here to make a mark in the industry

504
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:12,440
This is an unacceptable statement

505
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,680
Lots of hard work is needed

506
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,240
Hello

507
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:29,560
Welcome Sir, What a surprise

508
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:34,040
- Can I speak for a minute
- Sure sir

509
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,800
I just can't believe!

510
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:42,240
I haven't seen the film yet

511
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:46,200
But I heard, It had
a successful week.

512
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,840
That is a big thing

513
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:51,000
Celebrate it.. Party well

514
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,240
But...

515
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:00,680
What has this Director achieved
to talk with so much pride?

516
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,720
And you guys are encouraging him

517
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:09,960
Bro, lots of veterans have climbed peaks here
and you have just placed your first step

518
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:16,400
So... silently.. shut up and...

519
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:19,680
Hey, you are talking too
much..(Crowd shouting)

520
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:27,520
Public bro

521
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:31,800
- I'm really sorry sir, forgive me
- Better be

522
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:39,640
Arul sir is my biggest inspiration,
He spoke from his heart

523
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:44,800
Sir, I'm sorry, it's my mistake,
I'll never talk this way again

524
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:47,040
Please celebrate with us

525
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:55,040
Bro, I spoke that only for your well being

526
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:58,840
Our film should do the talking, not us

527
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,560
Please drink and dance with us
DJ song!

528
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,320
Dolly, we are late

529
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:19,160
Hey Yazhini

530
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:25,680
Yazhi, wait I'll drop you guys

531
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:28,920
Dear, I'll drop you guys

532
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:31,840
Bro, you leave, I'll
take care of them

533
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:43,600
Yazhu, nothing of such sorts
happened yesterday

534
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:45,000
Who told you?

535
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,120
Don't think I'll have
the same mindset always

536
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:51,160
One day when you come home,
I would've left you.

537
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:10,760
Are you not ashamed?

538
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:13,680
Danced around like a fool, and
getting in trouble with a girl

539
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:17,480
Getting bashed and thrown out

540
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,200
you are talking too much

541
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:46,200
- We couldn't do anything
- It was very embarrassing

542
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:49,280
Forget it, don't cry
Let's consult a doctor

543
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:53,320
Sir wait

544
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:55,160
I am talking to you sir

545
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:57,400
Sir

546
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,160
Sir just wait

547
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:00,560
Sir!
Who are you?

548
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:01,720
Sir!
Stop!

549
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:04,000
Arul, Just relax What happened?

550
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:07,000
You were the one who
waved at me in the party

551
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,280
You were dancing like clown,

552
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:10,520
Are you a spy?

553
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:12,200
Would you doubled-deal!

554
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:13,440
Would you doubled-deal!

555
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,640
He's a liar, He is lying Yazhu!

556
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:18,000
He is lying

557
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:22,560
Did you watch me inviting trouble
with any girl? Did you see?

558
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,560
You all are from reputed families....

559
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:27,280
- Why are you behaving like this?
- Just leave it this time sir..

560
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:28,240
Remove your shades

561
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:42,280
Look Yazhu, If you want to know about me,
You can ask me,

562
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:44,280
don't torture me by asking others

563
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:48,960
Lets get divorce

564
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:50,960
I can't take it anymore

565
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:55,880
- Dear, why are you talking like a fool
- I am serious

566
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:59,760
I have thought about it
Lets divorce

567
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:42,280
[Indistinct Chanting]

568
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:06,480
Don't shed tears,
I feel bad about it

569
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,120
What am I gonna do with the movie
It's already a loss for me

570
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:13,240
I had to pawn my wife's
jewels to shoot this film

571
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:16,520
I'm in a meeting, What's it?
Ask them to wait

572
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:21,720
More than the money or the movie,
I grade my self-respect above all

573
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:24,640
Your son did few things in anger

574
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:27,200
He spit out words,
I can't get over it

575
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:30,080
I've got 83 awards,
I will get angry

576
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,920
I'll lose millions it seems,
Let it go

577
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:35,160
I am ready to face the loss

578
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:36,800
You are right

579
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:39,000
Please forgive him

580
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:42,720
Because of this, The whole
family is shattered

581
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,800
Ok, leave it
just for you all, I'll release the film

582
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:52,960
Ask him to apologize,
I'll release the film

583
00:46:56,920 --> 00:47:01,160
We are working on settling the issue,
will call back in sometime

584
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:06,160
What's this uncle?
Didn't I tell you?

585
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:08,560
Why should we have a peace talk?

586
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:10,840
Why should my brother apologise, directing
a movie for him itself is a big deal

587
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:11,880
You don't apologise

588
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:13,800
He is a worthless fellow

589
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:16,280
Sister, brother should not apologise to him

590
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:18,800
Do you want your brother
to be alive or drink to death?

591
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:20,720
- Please
- enough Michael

592
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:24,920
Look...

593
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:28,480
I know this is a lot
but your movie has to release

594
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:34,320
For your movie and for us, just get
over with an apology to that stupid

595
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:35,600
Go and apologize...

596
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,320
Stupid!
More...

597
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:43,360
Scumbag, loser, Bastard

598
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:50,400
Scumbag, loser, Bastard

599
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:53,600
He is not a good guy

600
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:57,680
I'll do it for you all, Come

601
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:07,160
I am sorry, I have committed a mistake...

602
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:10,600
Please forgive me and
release the film soon

603
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:15,960
He apologized, Please forgive
him and release the film...

604
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:23,080
Have you ever taught your son about
manners? Is this the way to apologize?

605
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:29,160
Ask him to fall at my feet

606
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:54,800
Damm! watch your words!

607
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:57,560
They have invited us just
to insult and humiliate

608
00:48:57,560 --> 00:48:59,000
It's already done, what more?

609
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:02,080
You go and take care of Arul

610
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:03,880
Doss come lets leave

611
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:05,720
Come let's go

612
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:08,760
This is not fair

613
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:12,600
Humiliating an artist is a sin

614
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:19,600
Sir!
Sire

615
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:23,960
Sir, he humiliated me a lot

616
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:28,120
Looking at his face,
I got provoked and reacted

617
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:31,080
You spoke about sin and
made me a sinister,

618
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:36,160
I don't want any curse on my
family, Please buy the film

619
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:41,720
I spent 45 million, interest 10 million,
Pay 60 million and buy the film

620
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:46,600
Don't you believe me?

621
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:53,320
I swear on my family and the almighty, I will
give the movie, Please arrange the funds

622
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:06,680
If you had been there
You would have slapped him

623
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:08,800
You wouldn't have let me
to apologize?

624
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:14,000
Your son did ask sorry Mom

625
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:18,440
For the first time your son apologized
for a mistake he didn't do

626
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:24,280
But that idiot expects me to
fall on his feet and apologies

627
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:30,040
I felt ashamed, embarrassed...

628
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:32,560
- This is a hospital
- Sorry!!!

629
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:35,240
sorry it won't happen again

630
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:41,520
I was embarrassed

631
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:44,240
You guys kept silent?
Should have belted him

632
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:46,760
They forced me out,
Let's go now and thrash him

633
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:47,920
Just Shut up

634
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:50,320
Talk something useful

635
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:54,800
Even if we sell everything we
can make 20 to 30 millions

636
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:58,240
If we go for a loan no one
would give more than 10 million.

637
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:01,640
Think about what can be done
for the remaining amount

638
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:03,720
uncle... wait

639
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:05,960
Why not hand it over
to another producer?

640
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:10,120
Can't we get advance by
selling the TV rights

641
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:13,160
I've tried it, nothing will work

642
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:17,640
How about putting all our money in
as an advance and try to release the movie

643
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:25,320
He won't, Is he a saint to give the movie
without full payment, He is a dog

644
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:27,200
He is a shameless dog

645
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:29,720
Won't you understand?

646
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:33,200
- Please leave
- Sorry, really sorry

647
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:40,640
If we get a loan for the remaining
amount we will be in big trouble

648
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:42,880
I have an idea

649
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:51,040
If you all agree to it,
We can easily make money

650
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:52,320
What's that?

651
00:51:54,600 --> 00:52:02,240
If we selectively smuggle 1 or 2 statues
that our ancestors made, we will get money

652
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:09,640
Are you asking us to steal? idiot,
This is wrong

653
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:14,920
There is nothing wrong, I've already done
it once, I mean we have... isn't it Michael

654
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:15,960
Morons!!

655
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:18,960
I just went for a moral support uncle

656
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:23,720
Smuggling idiots, the whole family will be
behind bars if we get caught!

657
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:25,040
- We won't get caught

658
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:30,400
We are not going to rob
from a famous temple

659
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:33,760
A temple which has no maintenance and
has been locked for a long time

660
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:36,560
It would take at least 2-3 years
to find that statues are gone..

661
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:40,280
Most important, Goddess,
the goddess statues

662
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:43,040
If we can steal couple of goddess
statues from our own creations...

663
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:48,400
Are we going to smuggle
our own statues?

664
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:52,200
Idiotic thieves.. idiots
Don't you have any sense?

665
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:54,360
How many time do I have to tell you

666
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:56,680
Idiot! Why making a fuss

667
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:00,960
Get out, We are discussing
within the closed doors right

668
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:02,360
Get out!!

669
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:06,000
Why are you apologising to her

670
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:12,720
You continue

671
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:18,040
Dad, Sculpturing is an art

672
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:20,960
All your sculptures are
getting deteriorated

673
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:23,880
Why should such an art be left at a
place which has got no importance to it

674
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:26,320
Our brother's form of art is his film

675
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:32,240
We are just gonna take couple
of deteriorated statues to rescue his film

676
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:39,520
Are you trying to justify your smuggling
business in the name of saving art?

677
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:42,400
Doss, He's blabbering,
don't take him serious.

678
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:51,160
Unlike me who hasn't
respected my goddess wife,

679
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:55,640
You are going to save these
Goddesses from people like me.

680
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:00,960
If one creation saves an another one

681
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:11,360
Nothing is wrong

682
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:14,840
Do it!

683
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:31,480
Kannagi Temple This is it!

684
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,280
Smuggling it is easy
but if we get caught we are in trouble

685
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:36,560
Wow... Awesome

686
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:38,640
What's up?

687
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:41,440
500,000 USD, almost 25 Million INR

688
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:44,080
Hope our son in law has changed nowadays

689
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:45,600
shhhhhh,..... Mom!

690
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:50,440
I Can't live without speaking to you,
Please don't hang the phone malar....

691
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:56,880
is my grand daughter nearby

692
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:58,720
Dolly is sleeping mom..

693
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:07,040
Kannagi will get released
from the clutches of demons

694
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:09,800
and will return to her home...

695
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:11,880
Jegan, I agreed to a lesser
commission for the first time

696
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:14,040
but it seems like you will
become a professional smuggler

697
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:18,000
Bro mind your words

698
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:19,440
Give you a call back later

699
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:20,880
Sir, A doubt in silapathigaram,

700
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,360
As if you were listening,
what's your doubt?

701
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:28,800
Had Kannagi had an extra marital affair,

702
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:32,280
Will Kovalan be broad
minded to accept her again?

703
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:33,320
Idiot, Mind your words

704
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:35,800
Very unfair rules sir

705
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:37,840
- Jegan!! get out!!
- Thank you sir

706
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:14,360
My dear Brothers!!!

707
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:21,280
My film..NO...
you've given my life back

708
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:23,120
Enjoy brothers.

709
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:25,480
Leave it, Have a drink

710
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:30,000
Why would I need it anymore,
My film is all set for a release

711
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:35,120
We have to live up to our words
Or else we are not true superstars fans

712
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:39,960
You will free yourself from
the hands of the demon

713
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:42,360
What happened to him?

714
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:44,880
- Demons...
- Who's Demon?

715
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:46,440
My dad is a demon

716
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:49,880
You are a demon, You
too are a demon

717
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:53,000
I think he's hyped up

718
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,080
Just to accept you, reform you and

719
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:57,320
Give birth to your children
is not the definition of wife

720
00:56:57,320 --> 00:56:59,440
What else you need them for?

721
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:00,720
What else?

722
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:04,160
My dad destroyed my mother's life

723
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:07,080
She's always scared of him

724
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:14,280
My mom haven't seen anything in life
apart from taking care of us

725
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:20,600
One day she just got bedridden

726
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:24,720
Now by just showering his love,
Will she recover?

727
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:26,480
just Leave it..

728
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:29,040
He is the reason for her fall

729
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:30,280
Just leave it, everything
will be fine soon

730
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:31,400
You are no good either

731
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:33,600
Why is he coming after me now?

732
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:35,240
You destroyed my sister-in-laws
life by being a drunkard

733
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:36,880
I swear I won't drink hereafter

734
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:41,520
You married a girl
and brought her home

735
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:44,720
Still You are behind Malar

736
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:48,000
I do love Malar, I was
forced into this marriage

737
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:52,040
You give your reasons
All of you are demons

738
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:55,920
- Jegan, you know me well, don't spit out
words - You are all demons...demons...

739
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:57,840
Jegan watch your words...

740
00:57:58,040 --> 00:58:00,600
Kannagi will free herself from the demons

741
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:02,240
You all are Demons

742
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:04,480
Bro, take him home, he's high

743
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:07,600
Okay Kannagi will be set free

744
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:10,040
This is why shouldn't
drink with a newbies

745
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:15,120
yes I am a demon

746
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:16,600
Take care Bro...

747
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:19,880
One day kannagi will be set free

748
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:23,040
you sons of demons..

749
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:24,400
You just had 3 pegs

750
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:26,920
let's go

751
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:32,240
Malar...

752
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:51,080
I can't
Please understand

753
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:53,160
Why are you avoiding me?

754
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:57,160
I love you
Without you...

755
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:02,200
Won't you understand
What did you find in me?

756
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:04,560
Are you a romeo?

757
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:13,800
Look, this is just a dream

758
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:15,720
I did love my husband but...

759
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:19,040
After his death didn't I sleep with you

760
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:24,800
All these days have you
not touched your wife

761
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,680
Be a good husband, Go!

762
00:59:41,560 --> 00:59:42,920
Heavy rain!

763
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:44,040
One minute

764
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:52,640
Who is that?

765
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:56,760
Understand! Leave now!

766
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:03,920
Leave!
Please leave Mr.Noble

767
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:20,680
Has it been fixed?

768
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:23,240
Yes sister, I was informed late

769
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:26,080
So It took some time
to install the OS

770
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:30,600
But we have installed Windows 8 now
There shouldn't any issues hereafter

771
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:33,160
Even if you have,
we can sort it out

772
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:36,800
- Leave after the rain
- Okay

773
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:18,760
Viewers, This is your
favorite kollywood news show..

774
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:26,320
First time in the history
of Tamil cinema, a movie was

775
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:29,000
shelved and the producer decides
to re shoot the entire movie

776
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,200
The money is ready, I'm very happy

777
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:35,720
I drank bound to happiness

778
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:40,600
The way your car enters the street,

779
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:43,040
I'll know if you've drunk or not

780
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:47,720
You are a true detective

781
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:54,040
It's none other than yet to be
released movie directed by Arul... 17-05

782
01:01:54,040 --> 01:01:57,920
Let's see what the Producer
has to say about the film

783
01:01:58,320 --> 01:02:02,400
I produced the 17-05 film
which was directed by Arul

784
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:06,320
It's a wonderful script but Arul
failed in executing it well

785
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:09,880
This is an
important movie to Tamilans

786
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:14,920
I'm scrapping that movie and my
brother will be re-directing that script

787
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:20,400
Money is not my priority, This movie
must reach Tamil audience and I will...

788
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:25,640
What foolishness?
We said we will pay him

789
01:02:26,560 --> 01:02:30,480
Relax! We'll go talk to him tomorrow

790
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:32,520
Arul..

791
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:35,680
Please don't react now,

792
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:38,760
This will only increase our problems

793
01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:40,440
Please relax

794
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:41,560
Pick up the call..

795
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:09,800

796

797
01:03:37,640 --> 01:03:39,720
Uncle... Uncle...

798
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:04,480
At last..

799
01:04:04,760 --> 01:04:07,960
You've come! You could've informed
me you were gonna be out of town

800
01:04:10,360 --> 01:04:13,440
I called you to tell an important thing
You never picked the call

801
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:15,800
Uncle told that you are coming today

802
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:25,000
You are smiling
Do you know what it is?

803
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:29,360
Yesterday Aunt took me to the doctor

804
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:33,880
I am pregnant

805
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:42,760
What?

806
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:07,840
My dear...

807
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:19,400
Yeah sister,

808
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:21,720
What happened?

809
01:05:24,280 --> 01:05:26,160
Yeah I'm coming

810
01:05:26,280 --> 01:05:29,240
Where are you going in this rain
- A small work, will be back soon

811
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:31,280
- Dear
- I'll be back soon

812
01:05:51,840 --> 01:05:54,160
- Did my bro come here?
- Did Arul come here?

813
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:56,080
He didn't come here
What happened?

814
01:05:56,080 --> 01:05:57,040
Go to sleep...

815
01:05:57,720 --> 01:06:00,080
We brought 2 bottles
Did we drink both?

816
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:04,280
No, the other bottle is in the car

817
01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:06,440
Then he's not after liquor

818
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:10,400
Did he go there?

819
01:06:10,560 --> 01:06:11,520
Oh..Shit

820
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:24,160
- Is my brother here?
- Where is the producer?

821
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:26,280
Sir, has gone to the T.nagar office

822
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:30,920
Arul sir came searching
for him a while back

823
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:10,480
There are many to produce artistic films

824
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:11,960
You should've gone there

825
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:13,400
Why did you come here?

826
01:07:15,320 --> 01:07:19,400
Do kill me,
But let my movie release

827
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:24,320
That's like my child Sir

828
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:33,520
Film, child, art or creations won't win my
sympathy coz I don't understand them

829
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:39,200
Do you have any
idea about my past?

830
01:07:39,360 --> 01:07:41,160
Why did you accept my
offer to direct the film?

831
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:43,840
When you had accepted, you
should have kept quiet

832
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:46,280
Instead you raised
your voice against me

833
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:48,360
Motherfucker!!

834
01:07:54,560 --> 01:07:58,720
I apologized for all that, right?
Sir!!

835
01:08:00,520 --> 01:08:02,240
Please release the movie...

836
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:08,920
Basically, I am from a bad family

837
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:13,520
You came here drunk to confront me?

838
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:23,320
I bought a gun assuming that
I will kill you one day

839
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:29,720
I forgot to bring it

840
01:08:31,240 --> 01:08:33,160
Or else...

841
01:08:33,680 --> 01:08:36,320
Look Bro, He wanted to kill you,

842
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:40,920
Lets just call the police and frame
him with an attempt to murder case

843
01:08:42,680 --> 01:08:45,480
He hit me I won't let him go

844
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:51,400
It seems he would've killed me

845
01:08:52,360 --> 01:08:54,200
I wanna see him dead,
To rest my mind

846
01:08:54,280 --> 01:08:57,680
Kill him, We have got guys to
take the blame, don't worry

847
01:08:58,600 --> 01:09:04,240
Inside the cupboard there
is a hammer of this size, bring it

848
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:26,600
Hold his head high

849
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:32,480
Leave me!

850
01:09:33,400 --> 01:09:37,920
You sure, you gonna kill him,
Lift his face..I will kill him

851
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:39,000
Jegan Jegan

852
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:50,440
We'll take him, just leave it

853
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:55,800
Take him! If you were late
he would have been dead

854
01:09:56,400 --> 01:10:01,200
Look at the blood in his
face, We should thrash him

855
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:07,440
Have him under control
inside the house

856
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:13,160
- I did created a good movie, right
- I did mention that day to the
old man to teach him manners

857
01:10:15,160 --> 01:10:17,080
Is it a sin to
create a good movie

858
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:20,440
Look here, prodigy son
of cinema is crying

859
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:23,920
He would have killed me, If you
hadn't come I would be dead by now.

860
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:19,680
Convict proven guilty, 7 years
imprisonment, Rs.200,000 fine

861
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:22,280
What mistake did I do?

862
01:13:23,200 --> 01:13:24,160
I made a good film

863
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:27,440
Everything is gone

864
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:32,480
Yazhini too is gone

865
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:35,360
She wants divorce

866
01:13:38,240 --> 01:13:40,160
She has signed it

867
01:13:41,560 --> 01:13:44,640
Mugundhan attacked Arul and
attempted to murder him, so only..

868
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:46,720
See to it in your next appeal

869
01:13:47,960 --> 01:13:49,520
Mokaiya Mokaiya

870
01:13:55,160 --> 01:13:56,120
We told him, right?

871
01:13:57,200 --> 01:13:59,120
We'll buy the movie

872
01:14:01,080 --> 01:14:02,240
Then that bastard...

873
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:05,560
Sorry dad

874
01:14:06,200 --> 01:14:07,160
that's alright

875
01:14:08,160 --> 01:14:11,720
I told you, we shouldn't
have gone to meet him

876
01:14:12,440 --> 01:14:13,680
Hold on, Michael has come

877
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:18,680
- Sir, I will have a word with my wife
- make it quick

878
01:14:20,840 --> 01:14:23,400
Don't worry, within three
months we will bail him out

879
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:26,160
Please try as soon as possible

880
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:29,760
I will come out soon, Don't worry

881
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:31,440
Soon means?
in 7 years??

882
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:34,440
No, they will bail me out soon

883
01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:38,320
You weren't there...

884
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:43,320
I couldn't see my brother in that state...
So I lost control

885
01:14:43,320 --> 01:14:45,280
So you are ok to look at
me in this state?

886
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:53,400
Can we bail him by bribing someone

887
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:58,280
It might spoil it completely
- ask him to come back

888
01:15:01,480 --> 01:15:03,400
He would have bashed me to death

889
01:15:05,560 --> 01:15:07,480
He got bashed to death

890
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:11,040
He did that for me..

891
01:15:13,240 --> 01:15:16,520
We have to bring
him out at any cost

892
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:22,560
- I'll get bail right?
- Are you an idiot?

893
01:15:23,880 --> 01:15:25,800
I would have let him
go with few slaps

894
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:28,320
You blocked me but went on to kill him

895
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:31,440
Is it of any use to any of us

896
01:15:31,560 --> 01:15:32,600
Skip it Jegan

897
01:15:33,640 --> 01:15:35,560
It got to my head

898
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:37,680
He deserves to die

899
01:15:42,720 --> 01:15:43,680
Yazhu..

900
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,920
Micheal, Dad..

901
01:16:04,120 --> 01:16:06,920
Everything will be fine soon,
Ask bro to move on

902
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:09,760
I'll get bail soon, right?

903
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:12,280
will definitely get in the appeal

904
01:16:12,360 --> 01:16:13,320
Make it quick Jegan

905
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:15,520
Take care

906
01:16:19,240 --> 01:16:21,160
Here, take good care of him

907
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:24,360
Don't worry sir, we'll
take good care of him

908
01:16:51,640 --> 01:16:53,560
Sir is coming Get up!!

909
01:16:54,840 --> 01:16:55,800
Get up guys

910
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:25,440
There are already 26 patients here...

911
01:17:26,240 --> 01:17:29,280
Today you six are joining them

912
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:34,120
You can be from any background

913
01:17:34,200 --> 01:17:39,280
But here you all are drunkard dogs

914
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:41,120
Hello Boss,
Please give some respect

915
01:17:41,200 --> 01:17:42,160
What?

916
01:17:42,600 --> 01:17:46,240
Drunkard dog expecting respect from me?

917
01:17:47,960 --> 01:17:49,560
This is the respect you get!!

918
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:54,480
Go, Go, Fall in line

919
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:56,880
You bow bow doctor come here...

920
01:17:57,120 --> 01:17:59,240
Murder case sir

921
01:18:01,680 --> 01:18:02,640
Michael come fast

922
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:06,400
My name is Michael sir

923
01:18:07,200 --> 01:18:08,600
- what's the case?
- Murder case sir

924
01:18:08,920 --> 01:18:13,520
I'm standing alone and
yelling in your thoughts

925
01:18:16,360 --> 01:18:20,640
Oh dear, I'm ignorant of your love

926
01:18:21,680 --> 01:18:26,160
I was roaming around like a jerk

927
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:31,680
I was ruined not listening to you

928
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:38,160
I'm standing alone and
yelling in your thoughts

929
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:42,000
I was losing many things
in the name of drinks

930
01:18:42,160 --> 01:18:44,560
I was blind with my attitude
and roaming around..

931
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:51,640
In the name of freedom,
I got stuck in the cage

932
01:18:52,240 --> 01:18:56,920
You were in my thoughts
only when I shut my eyes

933
01:18:57,600 --> 01:19:02,200
I'm longing to hold your hands...

934
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:07,840
Ponni!

935
01:19:11,680 --> 01:19:13,600
How are you?
Did you see Doctor?

936
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:16,240
What they said?
Did you eat?

937
01:19:17,280 --> 01:19:18,800
How is the kid?

938
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:20,840
Ponni!!

939
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:27,120
The world is filled with
foxes and cannibals..

940
01:19:28,200 --> 01:19:32,840
I'm scared how you survive here alone..

941
01:19:33,240 --> 01:19:36,960
I was ruined not listening to you

942
01:19:38,360 --> 01:19:39,320
Didn't get appeal

943
01:19:40,240 --> 01:19:41,360
postponed to three more months

944
01:19:42,920 --> 01:19:43,880
Why Ponni hasn't come?

945
01:19:44,240 --> 01:19:45,640
I want to see my kid

946
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:48,520
She doesn't want the kid
to see you in prison..

947
01:19:53,120 --> 01:19:57,680
I hit myself taking the wrong turn

948
01:19:58,720 --> 01:20:02,640
I was blind to the blossoms...

949
01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:04,720
I'm leaving him based on your
compulsion,

950
01:20:05,360 --> 01:20:07,600
he's not recovered completely

951
01:20:08,520 --> 01:20:10,360
She's gone abroad for an assignment

952
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:12,720
It would be for a year or two

953
01:20:13,360 --> 01:20:15,360
Are you in touch with Yazhini?

954
01:20:16,040 --> 01:20:17,000
No!

955
01:20:25,960 --> 01:20:28,480
I'm standing alone and
yelling in your thoughts

956
01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:30,640
You are not drinking?

957
01:20:35,960 --> 01:20:38,600
Yesterday I went to your house,
saw the kid

958
01:20:40,200 --> 01:20:43,200
She's a cute little angel..

959
01:20:43,640 --> 01:20:44,600
I want to see her..

960
01:20:45,160 --> 01:20:46,680
I want to see Ponni and kid

961
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:50,080
brother?

962
01:20:50,440 --> 01:20:53,680
- All this is because of me, right?
- Leave it!!

963
01:20:54,440 --> 01:20:55,920
Have you started your next story?

964
01:20:58,120 --> 01:20:59,680
Write it bro, it will be good

965
01:21:00,280 --> 01:21:02,400
We will go as family to
receive the national award

966
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:04,200
It would be great

967
01:21:05,720 --> 01:21:08,520
All the best bro, you will rock

968
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:12,000
The theft details are
all over the news now

969
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:14,280
We can't do anything now, it's big risk

970
01:21:59,320 --> 01:22:00,560
Everybody get up, Warden is here

971
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,360
Outside You can be a rich
or a powerful person

972
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:25,760
you can be anyone...

973
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:30,880
but for us, you are all nothing but
bunch of drunkards

974
01:22:31,800 --> 01:22:33,720
We'll treat you like dogs

975
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:38,680
What are you staring at...
get that stick..

976
01:22:40,520 --> 01:22:41,480
Come upstairs

977
01:22:42,720 --> 01:22:43,680
Coming sir

978
01:22:46,240 --> 01:22:49,120
As for as I know,
you are completely recovered

979
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:51,240
It's all in your hands now

980
01:22:51,560 --> 01:22:52,520
I know

981
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:54,120
That's the problem sir

982
01:22:54,520 --> 01:22:57,040
In anger, my hands search for liquors only

983
01:22:58,840 --> 01:23:00,760
You are a creator

984
01:23:01,080 --> 01:23:03,960
Throw all your anger at writing

985
01:23:04,160 --> 01:23:08,120
Don't show at liquor,
it's good for nothing

986
01:23:12,480 --> 01:23:17,040
Your father called, they know about the
whereabouts of your wife and kids

987
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:18,880
You can leave now..

988
01:23:19,240 --> 01:23:20,760
Don't ever come back

989
01:23:21,160 --> 01:23:23,280
You are free to go now

990
01:23:23,680 --> 01:23:24,640
Get lost

991
01:23:30,640 --> 01:23:32,400
Use the ventilator only when needed

992
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,120
Dad, I'll go see Yazhu and dolly

993
01:23:40,520 --> 01:23:43,120
They never answered my call

994
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:46,560
They are ready for divorce, Don't
provoke them by saying anything

995
01:23:47,080 --> 01:23:49,200
If she knows I've changed Why
would there be any problem?

996
01:23:49,800 --> 01:23:52,800
Mom, I will go and bring back your
daughter-in-law and granddaughter

997
01:23:58,840 --> 01:24:00,760
Hello Uncle, how are you?
- Why are you here?

998
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:02,800
- Why are you asking silly questions
- please leave

999
01:24:03,320 --> 01:24:05,440
Why are you telling your
son-in-law to go out

1000
01:24:05,640 --> 01:24:08,000
Arul, leave!
- call me as your son-in-law?

1001
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:12,480
Uncle, your son-in-law is redeemed now

1002
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:16,520
Yazhu... Aunt, are you fine

1003
01:24:17,160 --> 01:24:20,840
We've just convinced her to move on,
Please leave without creating trouble!

1004
01:24:21,720 --> 01:24:23,800
What do you mean by that?

1005
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:26,280
Is she upstairs?

1006
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:28,520
She is getting married

1007
01:24:29,280 --> 01:24:32,520
What do you think of yourself?
Please give some respect

1008
01:24:32,680 --> 01:24:34,200
(Arguments between them)

1009
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:39,920
he is causing trouble here
- I'll talk to him

1010
01:24:42,200 --> 01:24:44,120
You come, Let her deal with this

1011
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,120
Yazhu, how are you?

1012
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:49,840
Your mom and dad are
saying stuff...

1013
01:24:50,160 --> 01:24:51,960
Please leave without
causing any trouble

1014
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:56,680
Please finish the divorce formalities
soon It's already getting late

1015
01:24:58,440 --> 01:24:59,400
I've stopped it all

1016
01:25:00,400 --> 01:25:02,360
It's been a year, I drank

1017
01:25:04,320 --> 01:25:06,920
Don't you get it,
It's already late

1018
01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:15,880
Dad!

1019
01:25:17,080 --> 01:25:19,280
Hey Dolly!
Hey Dear!!

1020
01:25:20,120 --> 01:25:22,120
- How are you?
- I'm fine

1021
01:25:22,400 --> 01:25:23,960
- You've grown a lot
- Yeah dad

1022
01:25:24,040 --> 01:25:25,120
Is there dust in your eyes?

1023
01:25:26,720 --> 01:25:29,200
- Dad is crying
- Don't lie daddy

1024
01:25:30,640 --> 01:25:31,600
I'm crying

1025
01:25:31,800 --> 01:25:34,400
When you shed tears,
You look funny daddy

1026
01:25:37,720 --> 01:25:39,160
You are a bad dad it seems

1027
01:25:41,160 --> 01:25:45,520
You will never become a good daddy,
so another good daddy is coming

1028
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,240
- Who said so, your grandpa?
- Yeah

1029
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:50,320
Has that fool started
with his villainous stuff

1030
01:25:50,320 --> 01:25:51,280
yeah

1031
01:25:51,440 --> 01:25:53,360
- What did your mom say?
- Nothing

1032
01:25:54,280 --> 01:25:55,520
She stayed silent

1033
01:25:55,720 --> 01:25:57,840
Why don't you become a
good daddy yourself

1034
01:25:58,600 --> 01:26:01,320
I've changed now, but
your mom isn't believing me

1035
01:26:01,560 --> 01:26:03,360
Why don't you just fall in love with mommy

1036
01:26:03,840 --> 01:26:06,040
Just like in the movies

1037
01:26:06,120 --> 01:26:08,720
Like in your first film!

1038
01:26:28,760 --> 01:26:30,760
Thank you!
Thank you!

1039
01:26:32,360 --> 01:26:35,520
Next is a special song
which we composed now

1040
01:26:36,040 --> 01:26:39,800
We've done that for a special
person in this crowd

1041
01:26:40,520 --> 01:26:42,040
- What's her name?
- Yazhini

1042
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:43,200
Don't stand here

1043
01:26:43,400 --> 01:26:46,280
This song is dedicated to Yazhini

1044
01:26:48,080 --> 01:26:49,760
And it's dedicated by

1045
01:26:56,560 --> 01:26:58,400
Hi dad

1046
01:27:11,920 --> 01:27:16,880
One angry look
One little smile, will do!

1047
01:27:20,840 --> 01:27:25,880
A short span of happiness
The spring time of bloom is here!

1048
01:27:30,200 --> 01:27:34,240
You are the reason, the clouds over me rain

1049
01:27:34,880 --> 01:27:38,800
And when they are no longer
there, what do I do?

1050
01:27:39,320 --> 01:27:47,000
The silence you keep
Shreds me into pieces!

1051
01:27:48,520 --> 01:27:52,200
Why my dear, such scorn over me?

1052
01:27:52,720 --> 01:27:56,920
Such a pity, your hate for me!

1053
01:27:57,280 --> 01:28:01,760
With you by my side
My life is full of lights

1054
01:28:02,280 --> 01:28:06,160
Come, let's go for a ride on the love boat!

1055
01:28:06,920 --> 01:28:09,560
Time shall pass and change
The color of love will stain on your heart

1056
01:28:11,440 --> 01:28:14,040
Time shall pass and change
The color of love will stain on your heart

1057
01:28:16,120 --> 01:28:18,760
Time shall pass and change
The color of love will stain on your heart

1058
01:28:20,680 --> 01:28:22,800
The color of love will stain on your heart

1059
01:28:25,360 --> 01:28:30,400
You're the only one
I have love for!

1060
01:28:35,440 --> 01:28:39,640
When I ache for you
My veins burst with excitement!

1061
01:28:44,040 --> 01:28:47,880
When I ache for you
My veins burst with excitement!

1062
01:28:49,040 --> 01:28:52,400
Don't fight with me, my love!
Forgive me! It's not too bad!

1063
01:28:53,600 --> 01:28:57,040
Asked for a wish to carry you
On a pallanquin, the princess of my heart!

1064
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:05,640
Why my dear, such scorn over me?

1065
01:29:06,320 --> 01:29:10,280
Such a pity, your hate for me!

1066
01:29:10,920 --> 01:29:15,280
With you by my side
My life is full of lights

1067
01:29:15,920 --> 01:29:19,800
Come, let's go for a ride on the love boat!

1068
01:29:20,920 --> 01:29:23,560
Time shall pass and change
The color of love will stain on your heart

1069
01:29:25,160 --> 01:29:27,760
Time shall pass and change
The color of love will stain on your heart

1070
01:29:29,720 --> 01:29:32,320
Time shall pass and change
The color of love will stain on your heart

1071
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:44,720
Hey! be silent
Don't clap

1072
01:30:04,440 --> 01:30:08,680
He'll come out after all formalities
Here he is

1073
01:30:21,560 --> 01:30:22,520
It took long time, sorry

1074
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:25,520
Should have got you out sooner
Sorry Michael

1075
01:30:26,280 --> 01:30:27,200
That's fine,

1076
01:30:27,720 --> 01:30:30,000
You have got me out Or
I would have rotted inside

1077
01:30:30,880 --> 01:30:32,240
Uncle, Ponni hasn't come?

1078
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:34,720
How is the child?

1079
01:30:35,080 --> 01:30:37,960
Arul wants to see you,
Let's go see Arul and dad

1080
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:40,760
Bro is fine right I'll go
home see Ponni and then come

1081
01:30:41,920 --> 01:30:43,560
Why hasn't Ponni come?
because of kid?

1082
01:30:43,560 --> 01:30:45,120
Come we'll first go
see Doss and then ..

1083
01:30:49,600 --> 01:30:51,160
It's been over a
year since we met

1084
01:30:52,120 --> 01:30:53,080
Why has she not come?

1085
01:30:54,880 --> 01:30:56,600
What is it uncle? where is she?

1086
01:30:57,480 --> 01:30:58,280
What happened to her?

1087
01:30:58,360 --> 01:31:02,000
I'll tell, But out of respect
we will go and meet...

1088
01:31:02,840 --> 01:31:03,800
Where is Ponni?

1089
01:31:09,880 --> 01:31:10,840
I want to see her

1090
01:32:15,560 --> 01:32:17,480
She resides in this address

1091
01:32:17,720 --> 01:32:19,360
The neighboring village
Go and see her

1092
01:32:19,880 --> 01:32:22,400
She told us not to to
tell anybody except you

1093
01:32:23,880 --> 01:32:27,160
Bro, please do take
good care of her

1094
01:32:56,280 --> 01:32:58,320
Welcome back,

1095
01:32:59,040 --> 01:33:00,200
She is inside, Go in!

1096
01:33:02,880 --> 01:33:03,960
It's all good times hereafter

1097
01:33:27,720 --> 01:33:28,680
Mom, Uncle

1098
01:33:30,680 --> 01:33:31,640
Mom, uncle

1099
01:34:20,720 --> 01:34:22,240
The prison life taught me a lot

1100
01:34:22,480 --> 01:34:24,960
I want to lead a happy life
with my wife and daughter

1101
01:34:26,400 --> 01:34:28,640
Tell her to believe
I can promise a happy life with her

1102
01:34:29,880 --> 01:34:31,880
What you say? He's
talking to you

1103
01:34:33,520 --> 01:34:34,840
I trust him, what else can I do

1104
01:34:35,480 --> 01:34:36,840
What is he going
to do for a living

1105
01:34:40,240 --> 01:34:41,200
What?

1106
01:34:42,360 --> 01:34:44,240
We had bakery
classes in the Jail

1107
01:34:44,360 --> 01:34:46,320
I can bake cakes and bread,
They will taste good

1108
01:34:46,600 --> 01:34:49,120
I'm planning to open a
small bakery in Chennai

1109
01:34:49,520 --> 01:34:51,360
Why in Chennai? Ask
him to stay back

1110
01:34:51,360 --> 01:34:54,560
Who do I know here?
Starting it in Chennai is suitable too

1111
01:34:55,280 --> 01:34:56,440
What will he do for the money?

1112
01:34:56,880 --> 01:34:58,200
Have to ask Arul bro for that

1113
01:34:58,320 --> 01:35:01,120
I still haven't seen him
after the release

1114
01:35:02,560 --> 01:35:03,520
Look!

1115
01:35:03,960 --> 01:35:06,200
If you are gonna go back to
that family I'm not coming

1116
01:35:06,560 --> 01:35:09,120
Enough of me suffering
for your loyalty

1117
01:35:09,440 --> 01:35:12,240
Nothing like that.. Who
else will give me money?

1118
01:35:12,920 --> 01:35:14,760
Get a loan, or
even beg for money

1119
01:35:14,960 --> 01:35:17,640
If you are going back to that
family, then we are staying back

1120
01:35:17,960 --> 01:35:20,720
We can live here for our life

1121
01:35:24,040 --> 01:35:25,880
Go in and talk to her

1122
01:35:31,120 --> 01:35:32,040
Go talk to her

1123
01:35:38,080 --> 01:35:41,240
Ok, I won't go and see
Arul or Jegan again

1124
01:35:43,320 --> 01:35:45,240
I promise I won't

1125
01:36:03,560 --> 01:36:06,360
Losses can either be mental or physical

1126
01:36:06,440 --> 01:36:11,800
You lost your husband mentally, and I
lost my wife physically in an accident

1127
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,800
I completely know what happened
in your life, I'm ok with that

1128
01:36:15,720 --> 01:36:19,640
I'll be a good husband and
a good father for Dolly

1129
01:36:25,360 --> 01:36:28,120
Ready 1,2,3...
Give me a kiss

1130
01:36:29,200 --> 01:36:30,160
Call me dad

1131
01:36:31,320 --> 01:36:33,120
- Uncle
- No, daddy

1132
01:36:35,520 --> 01:36:38,680
Just by giving birth you won't
become a dad, You got to be one

1133
01:36:38,880 --> 01:36:40,800
Till then you will have to wait

1134
01:36:43,720 --> 01:36:47,800
You should have told the child that father
has gone abroad and will be back soon

1135
01:36:47,920 --> 01:36:50,160
Ask anything your
mouth opens up wide

1136
01:36:52,640 --> 01:36:58,640
Just leave everyone, like a free bird,
liberate yourself from all this shit

1137
01:37:01,400 --> 01:37:02,920
Do you like to drench in the rain

1138
01:37:03,560 --> 01:37:04,960
Shall we?

1139
01:37:05,320 --> 01:37:06,880
We will be drenched

1140
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:10,800
That is all our freedom
and liberty is about

1141
01:37:13,880 --> 01:37:15,800
Welcome back Michael,

1142
01:37:16,600 --> 01:37:19,000
- How did you find her?
- I got her address from her friend

1143
01:37:19,120 --> 01:37:21,520
- Do you remember grandpa?
- Do you?

1144
01:37:22,120 --> 01:37:23,040
Ballon sir!

1145
01:37:23,840 --> 01:37:25,520
Who are you buying the balloon for,
For your daughter in law?

1146
01:37:26,120 --> 01:37:29,960
- What did you say?
- Your daughter calls you uncle that's why

1147
01:37:30,720 --> 01:37:32,120
Won't you talk knowing the situation

1148
01:37:32,760 --> 01:37:35,240
Leave all that,
I'll buy it for my grand daughter

1149
01:37:57,560 --> 01:38:00,000
I'm producer Mukundan's wife

1150
01:38:03,280 --> 01:38:10,520
Only after his death, We got
to know about all his debts

1151
01:38:11,040 --> 01:38:14,160
We sold all the properties
and settled the debts

1152
01:38:14,760 --> 01:38:17,720
Now all we have is your film

1153
01:38:18,240 --> 01:38:20,880
We will give it to the price you
offered, Please buy it

1154
01:38:21,720 --> 01:38:23,680
- What?
- Sir, Please sir.

1155
01:38:25,280 --> 01:38:28,520
We will withdraw the case, we
have lost a lot in that too

1156
01:38:29,600 --> 01:38:32,680
He did it out of his
loyalty for you

1157
01:38:32,840 --> 01:38:37,800
He tried killing you, he
ended up getting killed

1158
01:38:37,800 --> 01:38:40,480
He is not gonna come
back, this is your film

1159
01:38:40,560 --> 01:38:41,720
You release it yourself

1160
01:38:50,280 --> 01:38:51,600
Yet again!

1161
01:38:52,200 --> 01:38:55,400
They found that Kannagi statue was missing,
It's risky here

1162
01:38:56,080 --> 01:38:59,200
We had chosen a
'IRATAI' statue then

1163
01:38:59,600 --> 01:39:00,560
in Kerala

1164
01:39:01,200 --> 01:39:04,440
We let it then as it was an another state,
But now it's safe for us

1165
01:39:06,440 --> 01:39:09,760
Just one thing, we can't
do it without Michael

1166
01:39:10,600 --> 01:39:13,880
Don't need, he has
suffered a lot already

1167
01:39:15,160 --> 01:39:17,080
We can use someone
else, or I'll come

1168
01:39:17,280 --> 01:39:21,320
It won't work, just one
time, Tell him to come

1169
01:39:21,920 --> 01:39:22,880
He needs money

1170
01:39:24,320 --> 01:39:26,400
Do you know how much
we spent for his bail

1171
01:39:26,600 --> 01:39:27,560
Don't blabber

1172
01:39:27,960 --> 01:39:30,880
He did that for me,

1173
01:39:30,880 --> 01:39:31,840
Did we tell him to kill?

1174
01:39:34,360 --> 01:39:35,600
If you ask he'll come,

1175
01:39:40,560 --> 01:39:41,560
Bro, he is there

1176
01:39:45,320 --> 01:39:46,280
Welcome bro

1177
01:39:48,040 --> 01:39:49,960
- How are you?
- I'm fine, you

1178
01:39:50,600 --> 01:39:52,600
Welcome Jegan,
What bring you here all of a sudden

1179
01:39:53,600 --> 01:39:55,600
Uncle, bro is here

1180
01:39:57,160 --> 01:39:58,120
Bring some coffee

1181
01:39:58,680 --> 01:40:00,160
Are you fine Ponni?

1182
01:40:02,040 --> 01:40:03,000
What you said is right

1183
01:40:03,760 --> 01:40:06,880
- You all should be away from us
- Nothing like that bro

1184
01:40:08,920 --> 01:40:10,840
I've bought toys for you

1185
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:15,960
I have no option

1186
01:40:18,920 --> 01:40:20,800
If we do this
All our problems will be over

1187
01:40:23,720 --> 01:40:26,120
If you can do it for me,
If not leave it

1188
01:40:26,640 --> 01:40:28,560
I will look for another option

1189
01:40:38,680 --> 01:40:42,240
We'll do it this one last time
and stop with that

1190
01:40:45,520 --> 01:40:46,880
Let Ponni not know about this

1191
01:40:53,400 --> 01:40:56,040
- Do come home
- We will definitely come brother

1192
01:40:56,720 --> 01:40:59,920
They came visiting us, and all of a
sudden you want to go to Mumbai

1193
01:41:00,720 --> 01:41:05,560
I've told you already right

1194
01:41:09,040 --> 01:41:12,360
A friend of mine is in Mumbai

1195
01:41:13,160 --> 01:41:19,160
He is arranging for a loan for
less interest, that's why.

1196
01:41:20,920 --> 01:41:22,640
He will be giving assurance for me

1197
01:41:23,680 --> 01:41:24,640
I'll be back

1198
01:41:25,400 --> 01:41:26,360
Who is that friend?

1199
01:41:27,520 --> 01:41:29,920
Leave it, You are
questioning me like a cop

1200
01:41:30,680 --> 01:41:32,600
The baby got happy seeing the toys?

1201
01:41:33,240 --> 01:41:35,360
Should question a thief like a cop

1202
01:41:36,520 --> 01:41:39,440
I will believe what you say
but don't think I will keep on believing

1203
01:41:43,200 --> 01:41:44,160
Hear me out guys

1204
01:41:45,400 --> 01:41:47,800
We are going to a village named Katikulam
Near Wayanad

1205
01:41:48,280 --> 01:41:50,080
This is a small temple there

1206
01:41:50,680 --> 01:41:52,720
This temple is famous for exorcism

1207
01:41:53,560 --> 01:41:55,080
It opens only on Fridays

1208
01:41:55,720 --> 01:41:56,880
Tomorrow is Friday

1209
01:41:57,480 --> 01:42:00,880
Let's go see to know how crowded it is
and then plan when to rob

1210
01:42:01,360 --> 01:42:05,400
Other state vehicle, New sim
Seems like you have a clean sketch

1211
01:42:05,920 --> 01:42:08,280
Since it is another state
we have to be careful

1212
01:42:09,560 --> 01:42:11,160
If we get caught
They will bash us up

1213
01:42:54,840 --> 01:42:56,840
We can't smuggle it today,

1214
01:42:56,920 --> 01:42:58,000
Correct, we cant do it today

1215
01:42:59,080 --> 01:43:00,040
We'll do it tomorrow

1216
01:43:00,040 --> 01:43:01,520
Tomorrow the temple will be locked

1217
01:43:01,640 --> 01:43:04,000
You and Michael go for
tonight's Udukai Poojai

1218
01:43:04,440 --> 01:43:07,680
Ramesh will go as haunted
person and you will

1219
01:43:07,680 --> 01:43:10,240
accompany him, then hide
in the marked place

1220
01:43:10,400 --> 01:43:12,120
No one will check

1221
01:43:12,120 --> 01:43:14,000
They will close the temple
once the Poojai is over

1222
01:43:14,080 --> 01:43:17,280
Stay there till tomorrow night,
that's when we will rob it

1223
01:43:17,520 --> 01:43:19,760
Come out through the
exit we planned

1224
01:43:20,480 --> 01:43:23,200
We both will wait outside,
we'll swiftly move once we get it

1225
01:43:23,920 --> 01:43:24,880
- Jegan..
- What's it?

1226
01:43:25,560 --> 01:43:26,920
Nothing, I'm fine

1227
01:43:37,200 --> 01:43:38,160
Wait!
Wait!

1228
01:43:43,400 --> 01:43:45,080
Dude, never over react

1229
01:44:06,520 --> 01:44:07,480
come, no one's there

1230
01:44:23,240 --> 01:44:25,040
we will wait until lights turn off

1231
01:44:38,800 --> 01:44:41,360
I'm scared, how are we
gonna spend a whole night

1232
01:44:42,120 --> 01:44:45,320
only way to sleep
peacefully the entire night

1233
01:44:46,680 --> 01:44:48,600
Here have this

1234
01:44:50,200 --> 01:44:53,520
- What is this?
- BONG dose,

1235
01:44:53,880 --> 01:44:56,360
Deep sleep! You will wake
only tomorrow evening

1236
01:45:04,960 --> 01:45:05,920
It feels different

1237
01:45:07,560 --> 01:45:09,520
That is how it would be

1238
01:45:14,080 --> 01:45:17,560
- I'm getting high,
- I'm already flying

1239
01:45:32,120 --> 01:45:33,080
Ramesh!!!

1240
01:45:39,480 --> 01:45:40,440
Ramesh!!!

1241
01:45:46,640 --> 01:45:52,400
The eyes of fury, A Malicious heart
Do you see me?

1242
01:45:56,400 --> 01:46:02,880
With stained hands, I am of your same height Does it ring a bell in you?? I
share your name I share your voice I share your shadow Do you recognize me?

1243
01:46:06,400 --> 01:46:12,520
I share your name, I share your voice I
share your shadow, Do you recognize me?

1244
01:46:12,840 --> 01:46:19,000
You are me! You brute!
I am the form of your sins

1245
01:46:19,680 --> 01:46:25,640
You are me! You brute!
Death is the price for your sins.

1246
01:46:26,080 --> 01:46:32,080
You are me! You brute!
I am the form of your sins

1247
01:46:32,720 --> 01:46:38,840
You are me! You brute!
Death is the price for your sins.

1248
01:46:45,880 --> 01:46:51,680
I am revered, You are despised
I am the goddess, You are a brute sinner!

1249
01:46:52,280 --> 01:46:58,280
I am revered, You are despised
I am the goddess, You are a brute sinner!

1250
01:46:58,880 --> 01:47:04,960
You are me! You brute!
I am the form of your sins

1251
01:47:05,600 --> 01:47:11,600
You are me! You brute!
Death is the price for your sins.

1252
01:47:25,560 --> 01:47:28,440
Miscreants like you, Torment
women like me

1253
01:47:28,440 --> 01:47:31,480
Weplead for freedom, More
restrain is all we get!

1254
01:47:31,880 --> 01:47:38,520
We plead for freedom
More restrain is all we get!

1255
01:47:41,800 --> 01:47:44,880
I dismember the miscreants

1256
01:47:44,960 --> 01:47:47,600
I am the goddess who uproot prejudice!

1257
01:47:47,920 --> 01:47:54,400
I dismember the miscreants
I am the goddess who uproot prejudice!

1258
01:47:54,800 --> 01:48:01,040
You are me! You brute!
I am the form of your sins

1259
01:48:01,400 --> 01:48:07,280
You are me! You brute!
Death is the price for your sins.

1260
01:48:45,880 --> 01:48:47,800
Get up!

1261
01:48:48,800 --> 01:48:52,160
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

1262
01:48:52,360 --> 01:48:54,520
He is not alone
He had another guy with him

1263
01:48:54,880 --> 01:48:58,400
Two statues were missing,
Where is the other guy?

1264
01:48:59,080 --> 01:49:00,200
I'm talking to you

1265
01:49:01,120 --> 01:49:03,880
Answer my questions? Why are
you looking like insane guy?

1266
01:49:04,360 --> 01:49:06,120
Cuff him, Let's go

1267
01:49:07,040 --> 01:49:10,760
Clear the area... Move Move..

1268
01:49:11,120 --> 01:49:14,720
Walk..Walk fast..Walk

1269
01:49:20,120 --> 01:49:22,800
Michael, Senthil and
Ramesh cheated us

1270
01:49:23,440 --> 01:49:26,560
They gave me some drug, I woke up
and there were cops already there

1271
01:49:26,560 --> 01:49:30,600
Don't tell anything, I'll
take you out in 2 days

1272
01:49:32,880 --> 01:49:36,320
Who is this?
Who was that?

1273
01:49:37,600 --> 01:49:39,920
The police caught him

1274
01:49:41,960 --> 01:49:43,960
Don't panic

1275
01:49:44,360 --> 01:49:46,680
Poor fellow! He's again
in trouble because of us

1276
01:49:48,080 --> 01:49:51,200
Nothing should happen to
Michael, He should come out

1277
01:49:51,640 --> 01:49:54,720
I'll take him out, you
please don't panic

1278
01:50:15,880 --> 01:50:17,440
One stay here, lets go check whats wrong?

1279
01:50:24,200 --> 01:50:26,800
Move, Move What's the problem?

1280
01:50:41,760 --> 01:50:42,720
Sir, he's escaping

1281
01:50:43,520 --> 01:50:46,080
Catch him!

1282
01:50:47,960 --> 01:50:48,920
Quick!

1283
01:51:47,480 --> 01:51:48,480
Sorry sorry

1284
01:51:53,120 --> 01:51:54,120
Is this Arul?

1285
01:52:04,840 --> 01:52:05,840
Get two..

1286
01:52:08,920 --> 01:52:09,920
keep it here

1287
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:37,000
Can I drink some water?

1288
01:53:04,120 --> 01:53:06,120
Have you got the tickets?

1289
01:53:06,520 --> 01:53:09,280
It's for the night 10 PM bus

1290
01:53:17,440 --> 01:53:18,440
I was afraid

1291
01:53:19,320 --> 01:53:21,640
Michael, no stop!

1292
01:53:22,360 --> 01:53:23,960
Please listen!
Michael!

1293
01:53:26,200 --> 01:53:27,520
Hey, I'm telling you

1294
01:53:28,320 --> 01:53:30,320
Bloody traitors, you
cheated on me for money

1295
01:53:30,320 --> 01:53:32,760
Go ask Jegan, he is
the one who did this

1296
01:53:32,760 --> 01:53:33,800
You telling me about Jegan

1297
01:53:33,880 --> 01:53:36,080
He's telling the truth,
Jegan is the one

1298
01:53:37,960 --> 01:53:39,720
We got this money from him

1299
01:53:39,880 --> 01:53:42,240
We stole 2 statues, the
Iratai Iraivi is with him

1300
01:53:42,840 --> 01:53:43,840
This is our commission

1301
01:53:52,160 --> 01:53:55,400
After you left
Jegan asked us to stay

1302
01:53:55,840 --> 01:53:56,840
Anyone coming?

1303
01:53:56,920 --> 01:54:00,440
We are going to drink
don't forget, size 40

1304
01:54:01,440 --> 01:54:03,440
We have drinks right?
- Yes, got to get some cold water

1305
01:54:03,440 --> 01:54:05,760
I need to talk to both of you

1306
01:54:09,680 --> 01:54:10,680
20 lakhs

1307
01:54:10,960 --> 01:54:13,360
Whatever, it is a sin We can't

1308
01:54:13,440 --> 01:54:15,440
1 crore 20 lakhs

1309
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:18,000
12 million

1310
01:54:18,440 --> 01:54:22,400
I got tempted to do it for the money

1311
01:54:23,680 --> 01:54:26,480
Giving you the Bong sweet,
robbing 2 statues, and

1312
01:54:26,480 --> 01:54:29,120
informing the police were
all planned by Jegan

1313
01:54:33,720 --> 01:54:35,000
Enough of the bathing
Let's leave

1314
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:38,480
He made it look like we robbed
the statues and he caught us

1315
01:54:38,480 --> 01:54:41,680
Ramesh and Senthil cheated
on us and ran away

1316
01:54:41,680 --> 01:54:45,040
That Ramesh!!
- I've got the statue from them

1317
01:54:45,800 --> 01:54:47,800
They hit me and escaped

1318
01:54:47,800 --> 01:54:49,200
This doesn't feel good to me

1319
01:54:49,200 --> 01:54:51,600
He didn't say why he is doing this

1320
01:54:53,320 --> 01:54:55,320
Tell why you are doing all this

1321
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:59,880
In 10 days a guy will come to buy
the statue and settle the amount

1322
01:55:00,840 --> 01:55:01,840
Leave!

1323
01:55:01,840 --> 01:55:03,840
Our need for money got us into this

1324
01:55:05,160 --> 01:55:06,720
Money made us blind

1325
01:55:11,280 --> 01:55:13,000
The money made my mind flip

1326
01:55:14,080 --> 01:55:18,080
I wanted him to walk and get married
Lots of desire, I got confused

1327
01:55:20,200 --> 01:55:23,080
Forgive me

1328
01:55:23,400 --> 01:55:25,400
This is yours Take it

1329
01:55:26,080 --> 01:55:30,080
We were wrong
Sorry take everything

1330
01:55:35,480 --> 01:55:37,160
Why should Jegan do this?

1331
01:55:39,920 --> 01:55:40,920
I don't know

1332
01:55:43,160 --> 01:55:45,160
I think it is for the money

1333
01:55:59,960 --> 01:56:00,960
I'm gonna tell him

1334
01:56:02,880 --> 01:56:06,640
- Ramesh stop
- Michael, one minute

1335
01:56:09,240 --> 01:56:11,600
I got to tell this
I can't keep it within myself

1336
01:56:39,280 --> 01:56:41,120
I don't know whether it is right or wrong

1337
01:56:42,760 --> 01:56:46,520
It should be right
I'm seeing you from my childhood

1338
01:56:48,400 --> 01:56:55,040
You, My aunts, my cousin Maheshwari,
Veerama Miss, our Vegetable vendor

1339
01:56:55,760 --> 01:56:56,760
My schoolmate Rathimeena

1340
01:56:58,040 --> 01:57:00,560
All have been suffering because of men

1341
01:57:04,120 --> 01:57:06,120
I never want a girl to cry

1342
01:57:06,240 --> 01:57:09,480
And I hate men who makes women cry

1343
01:57:10,120 --> 01:57:13,960
I will give full liberty
to woman of my life

1344
01:57:14,200 --> 01:57:17,200
I will make all her wish come
true, she'll be happy and free

1345
01:57:17,440 --> 01:57:18,440
Like a bird

1346
01:57:19,080 --> 01:57:21,080
I've crossed many girls in my life

1347
01:57:21,320 --> 01:57:24,960
But no one had given me the feel
That she was the one for me

1348
01:57:26,400 --> 01:57:27,400
Till that day

1349
01:57:29,120 --> 01:57:30,400
Till I saw her

1350
01:57:40,600 --> 01:57:41,600
Don't get me wrong

1351
01:57:42,640 --> 01:57:44,120
From the moment I saw her
I liked her

1352
01:57:45,680 --> 01:57:49,160
But after knowing Michael was gonna
marry her I threw that thought away

1353
01:57:50,280 --> 01:57:51,880
Michael was like other men

1354
01:57:52,240 --> 01:57:53,640
He was even worse

1355
01:57:55,520 --> 01:57:59,800
After marriage, he still went behind Malar,
and at the same time got Ponni pregnant

1356
01:58:01,880 --> 01:58:03,360
How brilliant he is

1357
01:58:04,280 --> 01:58:05,280
Cheap bastard

1358
01:58:06,560 --> 01:58:10,560
You know she is pregnant,
you know you have a family

1359
01:58:10,560 --> 01:58:11,560
Should he not care a bit

1360
01:58:11,560 --> 01:58:15,280
Ponni is a poor soul,
He made her cry

1361
01:58:15,520 --> 01:58:16,520
Many means

1362
01:58:17,160 --> 01:58:18,160
Many ways

1363
01:58:18,840 --> 01:58:22,560
She cried a lot at different
situations for various reasons

1364
01:58:23,320 --> 01:58:25,160
I never liked to watch her cry

1365
01:58:25,640 --> 01:58:27,640
But seeing her I liked her more

1366
01:58:28,240 --> 01:58:30,720
Sympathy changed into love

1367
01:58:32,560 --> 01:58:34,400
Do you know how much I've spent?

1368
01:58:35,680 --> 01:58:37,160
I can't spend money just like that

1369
01:58:40,480 --> 01:58:42,480
- Let's get the bail when it's given
- Ok

1370
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:44,120
Your bail has been suspended

1371
01:58:44,920 --> 01:58:46,120
they've pushed it for 3 months

1372
01:58:49,240 --> 01:58:52,080
How is the work going,
No problem, right?

1373
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:56,160
And thanks for the job
- That's ok

1374
01:58:56,160 --> 01:58:57,160
I started loving her

1375
01:58:58,160 --> 01:58:59,560
I told her one fine day

1376
01:59:03,440 --> 01:59:06,080
John uncle sent me to pick you up,
get in

1377
01:59:17,920 --> 01:59:19,640
I love you

1378
01:59:22,600 --> 01:59:24,240
I want to marry you

1379
01:59:27,760 --> 01:59:29,200
Michael is in Jail

1380
01:59:29,400 --> 01:59:32,040
and I'm not a cheap guy to
use this situation

1381
01:59:32,800 --> 01:59:35,400
I've been loving you for a while

1382
01:59:37,480 --> 01:59:39,800
You are Michaels wife, all that is ok

1383
01:59:41,840 --> 01:59:44,840
I swear this isn't the
life you should be living

1384
01:59:45,120 --> 01:59:47,760
I can give a better life
for you and the baby

1385
01:59:48,320 --> 01:59:49,320
Think about it

1386
01:59:51,880 --> 01:59:54,680
I'm married and have a kid

1387
01:59:56,080 --> 01:59:57,960
But till day no one has loved me

1388
01:59:59,200 --> 02:00:00,680
You are the first to propose

1389
02:00:12,720 --> 02:00:13,720
We'll see tomorrow

1390
02:00:14,680 --> 02:00:15,680
I'll think about it

1391
02:00:17,720 --> 02:00:19,720
I thought she would surely say ok

1392
02:00:20,400 --> 02:00:23,080
But she left town without informing anyone

1393
02:00:24,040 --> 02:00:26,520
I've phoned them
No one is picking up

1394
02:00:26,520 --> 02:00:30,000
At least you could've gone
and checked in the morning

1395
02:00:30,560 --> 02:00:32,680
Why would she leave without informing

1396
02:00:33,200 --> 02:00:34,800
I'm sure she loved me

1397
02:00:34,800 --> 02:00:40,720
But it's our society and the
tradition should be the reason

1398
02:00:40,720 --> 02:00:43,320
That one logic should have made her leave

1399
02:00:44,440 --> 02:00:47,760
You all grew up that way, right?
brought us up too...

1400
02:00:48,080 --> 02:00:50,760
I consoled myself not to
disturb someone who left me

1401
02:00:51,080 --> 02:00:54,400
I'm damn sure, Michael won't
give her a happy life

1402
02:00:55,080 --> 02:00:56,280
Only I can

1403
02:00:58,320 --> 02:01:01,720
When I saw her again,
I decided then

1404
02:01:02,640 --> 02:01:06,080
Only I can give her a happy life

1405
02:01:09,320 --> 02:01:12,320
Michael is a brother to me
We grew up together

1406
02:01:12,920 --> 02:01:15,600
All that is ok
I got furious on him

1407
02:01:17,840 --> 02:01:20,320
Why to spoil a girls life
after marrying her?

1408
02:01:21,040 --> 02:01:22,040
Fool

1409
02:01:22,720 --> 02:01:24,120
The best place for him is Jail

1410
02:01:24,800 --> 02:01:27,080
The best place for Ponni and
the baby is to be with me

1411
02:01:27,880 --> 02:01:31,560
That's why I had sketched a
plan and sent him to jail

1412
02:01:36,760 --> 02:01:40,680
I really feel guilty about it
That's why

1413
02:01:41,160 --> 02:01:42,760
I wanted to tell you the truth

1414
02:01:43,040 --> 02:01:44,040
Ponni is hapless

1415
02:01:45,240 --> 02:01:48,360
She needs a good life, right?

1416
02:01:53,760 --> 02:01:54,760
I need Ponni

1417
02:01:56,920 --> 02:01:58,640
I love her truly

1418
02:02:25,400 --> 02:02:27,640
- What time does the function starts?
- 9:00 am

1419
02:02:27,800 --> 02:02:30,440
If you take the 7:00 am
bus, you will reach in time

1420
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:34,480
Inform Anthony sir that
I got an important work

1421
02:02:34,680 --> 02:02:37,960
Tell him that, we are buying rights for
Arul's movie, so only I couldn't make it

1422
02:02:38,520 --> 02:02:41,160
Gimme a ring when you reach there

1423
02:02:41,240 --> 02:02:44,040
I'll be back by the 5PM bus, come
and pick me up at bus station

1424
02:02:44,560 --> 02:02:48,560
Sure, Just ring me when
you start from there.

1425
02:02:54,240 --> 02:02:57,080
What happened to your phone?
There was no response at all

1426
02:02:58,200 --> 02:02:59,440
What kind of an attire is this?

1427
02:03:01,720 --> 02:03:02,720
I went to Bombay, right?

1428
02:03:03,480 --> 02:03:05,520
Ramesh said visiting Shiradi
nearby is a good omen

1429
02:03:06,600 --> 02:03:07,600
We both went there

1430
02:03:08,200 --> 02:03:09,200
Where is your bag?

1431
02:03:10,880 --> 02:03:13,240
I'm talking to you,
Where is your bag?

1432
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:15,440
The bag is in my friends car

1433
02:03:16,560 --> 02:03:17,560
I got the money

1434
02:03:19,320 --> 02:03:20,320
Got it!

1435
02:03:20,520 --> 02:03:22,880
Since the amount was
huge, I didn't bring it

1436
02:03:23,600 --> 02:03:24,920
He'll transfer it to my account

1437
02:03:25,160 --> 02:03:27,520
That's great, but
why are you sad

1438
02:03:27,520 --> 02:03:29,600
Tired? Shall I make some coffee

1439
02:03:32,800 --> 02:03:33,800
What?

1440
02:03:35,920 --> 02:03:36,920
What?

1441
02:03:44,200 --> 02:03:45,200
What?

1442
02:03:58,040 --> 02:04:00,040
What's it?

1443
02:04:01,640 --> 02:04:02,800
What's between you and Jegan?

1444
02:04:06,320 --> 02:04:07,320
Where did you go?

1445
02:04:08,640 --> 02:04:10,000
Just tell about you and Jegan

1446
02:04:11,240 --> 02:04:13,240
Did you lie about
going to Bombay?

1447
02:04:13,520 --> 02:04:15,960
I went to Bombay, Ramesh
came with me, You tell me

1448
02:04:33,320 --> 02:04:35,720
- Tell
- he said he loves me

1449
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:38,000
and you

1450
02:04:42,320 --> 02:04:44,320
Do answer my question!!

1451
02:04:45,640 --> 02:04:48,160
I too loved him, but never expressed it
I left town.

1452
02:04:50,080 --> 02:04:52,680
What does that mean?
What does that mean?

1453
02:04:54,360 --> 02:04:57,600
How much ever you make me suffer
It's my fate to live with you

1454
02:05:06,960 --> 02:05:10,960
Don't confuse yourself,
we just wanted to live a peaceful life

1455
02:05:11,560 --> 02:05:12,560
Let's do that

1456
02:05:24,520 --> 02:05:26,520
You didn't....

1457
02:05:31,960 --> 02:05:33,680
You wanna know if I slept with him?

1458
02:05:38,360 --> 02:05:40,360
You are not worthy to
ask such a question

1459
02:06:02,320 --> 02:06:04,320
Do you think I don't
know about Malar

1460
02:06:06,440 --> 02:06:08,440
Why the hell do you get married?

1461
02:06:12,680 --> 02:06:16,160
Am I a machine to take care of
you and give birth to your child

1462
02:06:17,600 --> 02:06:19,680
You go to prison in
the name of loyalty

1463
02:06:20,600 --> 02:06:23,320
You have got any idea about these 2
years of struggle I went through?

1464
02:06:24,520 --> 02:06:26,520
Now you are asking whether
I slept with him?

1465
02:06:30,240 --> 02:06:33,280
What will you do if I slept with him?
Will you kill me?

1466
02:06:34,520 --> 02:06:36,280
I'm not going to
answer your question

1467
02:06:37,040 --> 02:06:40,000
without knowing that if you can
lead a happy life with me, lets go ahead

1468
02:06:40,560 --> 02:06:43,040
Or I'll live on my own
I'm used to it

1469
02:07:10,480 --> 02:07:11,480
Sorry

1470
02:07:13,280 --> 02:07:14,280
Sorry

1471
02:07:24,600 --> 02:07:26,560
You and baby are my life

1472
02:07:27,200 --> 02:07:28,920
I want to live with you

1473
02:07:35,880 --> 02:07:37,880
Go get the money from your friend

1474
02:07:38,680 --> 02:07:42,960
We'll leave immediately
We can't live here anymore

1475
02:07:53,840 --> 02:07:55,840
But Ponni

1476
02:07:59,200 --> 02:08:03,000
However you ask, I'll never
answer that question

1477
02:08:15,840 --> 02:08:17,840
Everything is right?

1478
02:08:18,480 --> 02:08:20,360
- Give it!
- Here Madam

1479
02:08:21,040 --> 02:08:23,480
You'll get the balance in a week

1480
02:08:24,400 --> 02:08:26,760
Release it soon,
it's a confirm hit

1481
02:08:27,280 --> 02:08:27,960
All the best sir

1482
02:08:28,040 --> 02:08:31,400
- We'll get it in a week
- Don't worry, we'll get it in a weeks time

1483
02:08:33,080 --> 02:08:35,080
From this moment you
are gonna shine

1484
02:08:35,600 --> 02:08:37,640
Have it

1485
02:08:39,880 --> 02:08:42,240
Bloody traitors...
Did this to us...

1486
02:08:43,120 --> 02:08:45,320
He'll be back
He spoke regarding his release

1487
02:08:45,760 --> 02:08:47,760
Yeah, I've spoke to the
corresponding people

1488
02:08:47,760 --> 02:08:51,080
He should've been out today
As it's Saturday he'll be out in 2 days

1489
02:08:51,080 --> 02:08:52,080
Don't worry

1490
02:08:52,080 --> 02:08:55,080
Uncle, don't worry
We won't leave Michael stranded

1491
02:08:55,480 --> 02:08:59,760
Surely you won't, but I don't
know how I'll manage Ponni

1492
02:09:00,120 --> 02:09:03,840
Leave that, go talk to your
wife and bring them home

1493
02:09:03,880 --> 02:09:06,480
I'm going there
Ok, I'll leave then

1494
02:09:15,040 --> 02:09:15,880
Hello

1495
02:09:36,160 --> 02:09:39,000
It's nothing

1496
02:09:41,600 --> 02:09:43,680
Did you escape from there?

1497
02:09:44,120 --> 02:09:45,120
Yes

1498
02:09:47,200 --> 02:09:50,560
- You didn't tell anyone, right?
- No, why take such a risk

1499
02:09:51,400 --> 02:09:54,880
Jegan made arrangements to
get you out in 2 days...

1500
02:09:55,880 --> 02:10:00,600
I escaped before they filed a FIR,
I can't got back to jail again

1501
02:10:01,560 --> 02:10:05,000
I can't stay here anymore, I'm
planning to leave and I need money

1502
02:10:05,160 --> 02:10:07,840
In a week we'll get the
money, take 50 lakhs

1503
02:10:07,840 --> 02:10:10,840
I don't need 50, just
give me 10 lakhs

1504
02:10:10,960 --> 02:10:13,320
I'm leaving today,
It's good if I get it today

1505
02:10:16,520 --> 02:10:18,440
Do one thing, I'll talk to dad

1506
02:10:19,200 --> 02:10:22,040
You go to our house and
collect 8 lakhs from him

1507
02:10:22,560 --> 02:10:24,520
I'll give you 2 lakhs later

1508
02:10:26,320 --> 02:10:28,480
We bought the film back

1509
02:10:29,600 --> 02:10:30,600
It'll release soon

1510
02:10:32,080 --> 02:10:33,080
It's all because of you

1511
02:10:35,360 --> 02:10:37,880
Why are you emotional?

1512
02:10:38,120 --> 02:10:40,560
Such a huge thing, you should
express it with utmost happiness

1513
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:43,880
Express it again, come on

1514
02:10:44,520 --> 02:10:46,400
One more! Action!

1515
02:10:46,840 --> 02:10:47,840
Action!

1516
02:10:50,560 --> 02:10:52,560
Our film is gonna release

1517
02:10:53,680 --> 02:10:56,080
Let this happiness stay

1518
02:10:58,720 --> 02:11:02,320
Let me know when you leave
I'll go see Yazhu and Dolly

1519
02:11:02,320 --> 02:11:04,560
Get the money from dad

1520
02:11:06,280 --> 02:11:10,800
Meet jegan, he'll be
happy seeing you

1521
02:11:11,240 --> 02:11:13,960
He was upset when
you were caught

1522
02:11:13,960 --> 02:11:17,160
I'll go surprise him in
college, you don't tell him

1523
02:11:17,360 --> 02:11:18,360
I won't, you go

1524
02:11:19,840 --> 02:11:21,200
Convey my regards to the family

1525
02:11:21,200 --> 02:11:25,080
Our whole family will go to
Delhi and collect the award

1526
02:11:42,520 --> 02:11:43,520
Why has he come here?

1527
02:11:43,520 --> 02:11:45,480
Why are you here? Get out
- What's happening here?

1528
02:11:45,480 --> 02:11:46,960
- Yazhu
- Why are you calling her now?

1529
02:11:49,080 --> 02:11:51,920
Engagement between
Good daddy and mummy

1530
02:11:55,560 --> 02:11:58,760
- Are you a respectable
gentleman, move out of my way

1531
02:11:59,480 --> 02:12:03,680
For our family, You've suffered a lot..
Take care

1532
02:12:04,600 --> 02:12:08,000
Only after seeing you I am happy

1533
02:12:08,280 --> 02:12:11,280
There is only 5 Lakhs in this, You've got
3 Lakhs in the shop, Give it to him

1534
02:12:11,280 --> 02:12:12,280
ok Doss

1535
02:12:13,480 --> 02:12:14,480
good bye, live long

1536
02:12:17,680 --> 02:12:18,680
Office, where is Yazhu?

1537
02:12:21,520 --> 02:12:22,480
Where is Yazhu?

1538
02:12:22,480 --> 02:12:25,000
Go away from here,
Why are you here?

1539
02:12:31,480 --> 02:12:32,480
What's this?

1540
02:12:35,600 --> 02:12:36,600
What's all this?

1541
02:12:39,120 --> 02:12:41,120
It's all because of you

1542
02:12:41,480 --> 02:12:43,200
Look what you've done

1543
02:12:44,480 --> 02:12:48,080
I've completely changed now
I've stopped drinking

1544
02:12:48,560 --> 02:12:50,560
Hereafter don't worry about anything

1545
02:12:52,360 --> 02:12:53,560
I'm talking to her

1546
02:12:57,720 --> 02:12:59,000
It's been 5 months
since I drank,

1547
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:02,000
And my film is gonna release

1548
02:13:02,800 --> 02:13:05,640
No problems anymore, believe me

1549
02:13:06,680 --> 02:13:08,680
I can't forget you

1550
02:13:09,120 --> 02:13:10,560
You are a drunkard

1551
02:13:10,720 --> 02:13:12,960
Should I live with you,
or just stay like this

1552
02:13:12,960 --> 02:13:13,960
or get married

1553
02:13:14,800 --> 02:13:17,720
These confusions are killing me inside

1554
02:13:18,400 --> 02:13:19,400
It's nothing

1555
02:13:20,680 --> 02:13:22,880
It's nothing, No confusion

1556
02:13:23,560 --> 02:13:25,560
You are going to live with me

1557
02:13:27,080 --> 02:13:29,080
Believe me, please

1558
02:13:30,480 --> 02:13:31,760
You won't cheat me again, right?

1559
02:13:35,920 --> 02:13:36,920
I surely won't

1560
02:13:39,160 --> 02:13:40,480
I'll leave now, you
guys come later

1561
02:13:40,600 --> 02:13:44,840
Don't tell me you have missed something.
Where is the driver?

1562
02:13:45,440 --> 02:13:46,400
Yes sir!

1563
02:13:48,320 --> 02:13:50,120
I need to talk to you,
you know who I am right?

1564
02:13:50,120 --> 02:13:52,040
I know, Arul right?

1565
02:13:52,240 --> 02:13:54,880
Your Ex-would-be's
current husband

1566
02:14:01,440 --> 02:14:05,560
Where are you going, you said
Karnataka and you are leaving today

1567
02:14:08,520 --> 02:14:10,880
I am leaving to Bangarupet with
Ponni today by train

1568
02:14:11,400 --> 02:14:14,840
If she knows I am meeting them
I can't handle her

1569
02:14:15,440 --> 02:14:19,240
I won't tell, Jegan is the one
who worried when you got caught

1570
02:14:20,080 --> 02:14:22,400
He had made arrangements
to get you out

1571
02:14:22,880 --> 02:14:24,800
But you have already escaped

1572
02:14:25,040 --> 02:14:26,960
He'll be happy to see you

1573
02:14:27,360 --> 02:14:29,280
Go to college and see him

1574
02:14:29,680 --> 02:14:31,600
I'll go and see him at college

1575
02:14:32,080 --> 02:14:35,800
You don't inform him, I
want to surprise him

1576
02:14:40,760 --> 02:14:43,120
- Uncle
- Jegan is here

1577
02:14:44,480 --> 02:14:49,400
You wait here, I'll go first, then you
enter and lets surprise him as you said

1578
02:14:57,040 --> 02:14:58,000
Uncle

1579
02:15:00,320 --> 02:15:02,400
- Why didn't you go to college?
- How can I?

1580
02:15:06,600 --> 02:15:08,360
I am very happy

1581
02:15:08,720 --> 02:15:09,680
What's all this?

1582
02:15:10,160 --> 02:15:11,120
I'm happy uncle

1583
02:15:11,320 --> 02:15:13,240
Arul bros movie is gonna release

1584
02:15:15,040 --> 02:15:16,640
Out of joy I got drunk

1585
02:15:16,920 --> 02:15:19,240
If Michael was here It would
have been great, right?

1586
02:15:22,680 --> 02:15:23,640
Yeah

1587
02:15:24,560 --> 02:15:25,680
It would have been happier

1588
02:15:28,240 --> 02:15:30,600
He is the only one missing

1589
02:15:31,480 --> 02:15:33,400
He's coming out on Monday

1590
02:15:39,760 --> 02:15:41,680
Uncle I'm leaving Bye Jegan

1591
02:15:45,080 --> 02:15:49,560
He came in the morning, he wanted to
surprise you but you are already here

1592
02:15:49,920 --> 02:15:51,840
Why did you escape?

1593
02:15:52,640 --> 02:15:55,120
Why?
I would have got you out of jail.

1594
02:15:56,920 --> 02:15:59,200
You've come..
Super!!!

1595
02:16:02,080 --> 02:16:04,880
I'm feeling happy for you

1596
02:16:06,560 --> 02:16:12,040
Michael, I'll find those
traitors and bash them up

1597
02:16:14,200 --> 02:16:16,040
Ok, I'm leaving

1598
02:16:16,520 --> 02:16:17,560
Where are you going?

1599
02:16:17,920 --> 02:16:19,680
He is going out of town
to make a living

1600
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:20,960
Where?

1601
02:16:21,480 --> 02:16:22,440
I'm going to Bombay

1602
02:16:22,520 --> 02:16:23,480
Staying here is a risk

1603
02:16:26,560 --> 02:16:27,680
Are you scared of the Police?

1604
02:16:29,280 --> 02:16:32,840
I'll take care, don't worry

1605
02:16:35,640 --> 02:16:38,200
Uncle, I am leaving

1606
02:16:38,760 --> 02:16:39,720

02:16:46,240 --> 02:16:47,200
Just you?

1609
02:16:49,880 --> 02:16:51,480
All of us

1610
02:16:53,160 --> 02:16:55,040
All in 2-3 days

Else I'll kill you

1616
02:17:29,360 --> 02:17:32,120
What's this Michael?
What have you done?

1617
02:17:33,080 --> 02:17:34,480
Why did you hit him?

1618
02:17:35,880 --> 02:17:37,800
He's bleeding

1619
02:17:42,960 --> 02:17:44,720
Won't I know how to take
care of my wife

1620
02:17:45,960 --> 02:17:48,240

1621
02:17:48,760 --> 02:17:50,680
- Die!
- Don't hit him

1622
02:17:53,400 --> 02:17:55,680
He's the one who who sketched
a plan for me to go to jail

1623
02:17:57,080 --> 02:17:59,000
He confused Ponni

1624
02:17:59,560 --> 02:18:01,480
Please don't hit him

1625
02:18:02,200 --> 02:18:04,800
Won't I know how to
take care of my wife

1626
02:18:10,760 --> 02:18:11,720
What's this?

1627
02:18:19,440 --> 02:18:21,360
Jegan!!!

1628
02:18:27,720 --> 02:18:28,680
What have you done?

1629
02:18:33,760 --> 02:18:35,840
It's not my mistake

1630
02:18:36,600 --> 02:18:39,760
I wanted to leave without
seeing him, It's his mistake

1631
02:18:39,920 --> 02:18:42,480
I thought of leaving
without seeing him

1632
02:18:50,520 --> 02:18:53,760
Ponni and baby will be waiting
I got to leave uncle

1633
02:18:55,080 --> 02:18:58,040
Ponni will wait for me,
I want to live with her

1634
02:18:58,640 --> 02:19:04,200
Go! Get out!
Go live happily

1635
02:19:07,080 --> 02:19:08,040
Jegan

1636
02:19:46,960 --> 02:19:48,560
Why are we leaving
all of a sudden

1637
02:19:49,920 --> 02:19:53,240
We got the money,
so we are leaving

1638
02:19:55,640 --> 02:19:57,560
Why do you look dull?

1639
02:19:59,840 --> 02:20:02,960
We are going to a new place, a
new life, The fear of all that

1640
02:20:04,320 --> 02:20:05,600
It'll all be fine

1641
02:20:07,760 --> 02:20:09,680
Are you still thinking about it?

1642
02:20:11,440 --> 02:20:12,400
About Jegan?

1643
02:20:19,200 --> 02:20:20,920
I don't need that answer anymore

1644
02:20:26,320 --> 02:20:30,360
- Mommy, Choci - we'll get it in the
next station, train might leave

1645
02:20:31,160 --> 02:20:33,080
Uncle Chooci

1647
02:20:41,160 --> 02:20:43,080
Dad Chooci!

1648
02:20:45,240 --> 02:20:47,160
She called you daddy

1649
02:20:49,040 --> 02:20:50,640
Dad chooci

1650
02:20:52,280 --> 02:20:54,200
The train might leave

1651
02:21:03,600 --> 02:21:07,720
Give 2 biscuit's and
few chocolates

1652
02:21:09,040 --> 02:21:10,560
Dad's gone to cut chocolates

1653
02:21:11,600 --> 02:21:12,560

1654
02:21:24,840 --> 02:21:26,760
What's it uncle?

1655
02:21:26,840 --> 02:21:29,480
Forgive me, I
couldn't lie to them

1656
02:21:39,040 --> 02:21:43,040
Arul is here, tell him what
happened, he'll forgive you

1657
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:46,760
I'll go to prison for you

1658
02:21:58,120 --> 02:21:59,560
Jegan did a mistake brother

1659
02:22:00,040 --> 02:22:02,680
He did it out of anger forgive him

1660
02:22:06,640 --> 02:22:09,160
You could've told this
in the morning itself

1661
02:22:11,760 --> 02:22:13,680
We treated you like
our brother, right

1662
02:22:13,800 --> 02:22:16,160
- He did something wrong
- He is a small boy

1663
02:22:21,400 --> 02:22:23,360
You are like my brother

1664
02:22:27,240 --> 02:22:28,160
He is my brother

1665
02:22:57,120 --> 02:22:59,120
Where is the chocolate, your
father is yet to come

1666
02:24:05,440 --> 02:24:06,400
It's him

1667
02:24:07,960 --> 02:24:12,200
Yes It's him, You go away dear

1668
02:24:12,600 --> 02:24:15,360
All these males are
dominant egoistic bastards

1669
02:24:16,120 --> 02:24:22,080
Your happiness always rests within you.
Stop searching for peace through these men.

1670
02:24:24,200 --> 02:24:28,440
Go away and live happily

1671
02:24:29,320 --> 02:24:30,280
Leave!

1672
02:25:36,960 --> 02:25:39,600
We are taking him to the station You
can bail him out with your lawyer

1673
02:25:45,280 --> 02:25:46,720
You could've forgiven him

1674
02:25:48,680 --> 02:25:50,840
That was your promise

1675
02:25:51,560 --> 02:25:52,520
I couldn't uncle

1676
02:25:54,640 --> 02:25:56,520
Got my nerves for

1677
02:25:57,960 --> 02:26:00,240
Uncontrollable anger

1678
02:26:01,080 --> 02:26:02,040
Pain

1679
02:26:02,920 --> 02:26:03,880
Fury

1680
02:26:04,240 --> 02:26:07,360
When all of your lives were
getting in shape, You broke it

1681
02:26:07,840 --> 02:26:10,400
Look at the way he is lying dead

1682
02:26:14,560 --> 02:26:16,000
What are you going to do?

1683
02:26:17,520 --> 02:26:22,040
For a moment You could've
thought about Yazhu and Dolly

1684
02:26:22,720 --> 02:26:23,680
Yes I could've

1685
02:26:25,640 --> 02:26:27,560
Even he could've remained calm

1686
02:26:29,200 --> 02:26:32,880
Or I too could've
symphathised and let him live

1687
02:26:34,760 --> 02:26:35,720
I couldn't uncle

1688
02:26:38,680 --> 02:26:41,000
We are not women to be
patience and tolerant

1689
02:26:43,320 --> 02:26:44,760
We are MEN

1690
02:26:46,200 --> 02:26:48,840
MEN - the supreme

1691
02:26:50,280 --> 02:26:52,320
Women - the subtle

1692
02:26:56,480 --> 02:26:59,840
We all men are such
a low life scums

1693
02:27:10,200 --> 02:27:11,480
I'll make a call

1694
02:27:13,760 --> 02:27:16,320
After the call collect all his
things and submit it in the station

1695
02:27:20,640 --> 02:27:22,560
What happened?
Did you spoke to him

1696
02:27:29,000 --> 02:27:29,960
You

1697
02:27:33,760 --> 02:27:39,760
You'll get engaged for your second marriage

1698
02:27:42,680 --> 02:27:45,920
Am I a broker to mediate your talks

1699
02:27:52,360 --> 02:27:57,400
Do I look like a joker to you guys?

1700
02:28:05,480 --> 02:28:10,480
I will never quit drinking,
Yes I am a drunkard

1701
02:28:13,200 --> 02:28:20,400
You can marry him, If you don't
like him, go for another marriage

1702
02:28:26,920 --> 02:28:29,800
If you don't like him either,
go for another marriage

1703
02:28:30,960 --> 02:28:33,480
I don't give a shit, you Bit**

1704
02:28:44,760 --> 02:28:49,840
I want to drink, I'll drink I
want to be happy, I'll be happy

1705
02:28:51,560 --> 02:28:54,640
I want to be happy

Let's go..

1707

I'm coming

1708
02:29:32,840 --> 02:29:36,800
I told you not to trust him

1709
02:29:37,960 --> 02:29:40,600
If you want to be happy,
accept the marriage proposal

1710
02:29:40,680 --> 02:29:42,720
He has blabbered
something to them too

Mom

1712
02:29:46,160 --> 02:29:47,120

- That uncle won't be coming

1717
02:31:00,600 --> 02:31:02,160
Do you want to get drenched in the rain?

1718
