1
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:46,657
Play!

2
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:53,328
Come... come...

3
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:48,217
Hey, get the sacrifice pot ready.

4
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:51,725
Come... come fast...

5
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:56,634
Let anyone dare go against me,
I'll hack them to death.

6
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:59,394
I'll do whatever brother says.

7
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:36,006
The job is done, brother.

8
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,619
Did you kill?

9
00:04:52,392 --> 00:04:53,791
Will you kill?

10
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:56,728
Will you kill my wife?

11
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:23,387
I was almost crossing the
winning line but had to lose.

12
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:32,060
6 months earlier...

13
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:37,099
This wasn't the life I had dreamt.

14
00:05:45,411 --> 00:05:46,673
My name is Ramakrishna,

15
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:48,370
I always had a recurring dream,

16
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:50,573
though it never came true,
everyone would make fun of me,

17
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,742
but today that dream has come true,

18
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:03,928
never play with life,
that's my father's policy,

19
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:06,691
life is a game, that's my policy,

20
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:09,864
football is my life,

21
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:13,703
if I kick it's a goal, that's all.

22
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:15,932
Till yesterday I was nobody,

23
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:19,875
with just one international game,
I had become famous.

24
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:44,631
You've brought laurels to the state.

25
00:06:44,804 --> 00:06:47,568
On behalf of the Govt,
I'm sanctioning Rs.50 lakhs cash award,

26
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:50,004
and 1000 yards of house plot.

27
00:06:50,176 --> 00:06:50,938
Impossible sir.

28
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:53,169
I'll meet the Minister
for a minute only.

29
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:54,842
I'm Ramakrishna's father.

30
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:56,939
Sir, my father.

31
00:06:58,951 --> 00:06:59,747
Go sir.

32
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:02,246
Greetings sir.
- Greetings.

33
00:07:02,321 --> 00:07:03,984
My name is Adinarayana,
I'm his father.

34
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:05,954
What's this?
- His certificates.

35
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:08,093
He's wasting his life
in playing sports,

36
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,157
if you get him a govt. Job,

37
00:07:10,496 --> 00:07:12,691
I'll be eternally grateful
to you sir.

38
00:07:25,044 --> 00:07:26,841
Did you father puncture it again?

39
00:07:27,013 --> 00:07:29,607
If air leaks out from ball,
it means he has made a hole.

40
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:33,708
My brother-in-law comes into dreams
too without sitting at home peacefully.

41
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:34,512
My brother-in-law!

42
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:36,882
Is it the same dream as yesterday
or any improvement?

43
00:07:37,056 --> 00:07:37,988
Great improvement, uncle.

44
00:07:38,057 --> 00:07:39,351
Day before yesterday it was corporator,

45
00:07:39,352 --> 00:07:40,114
yesterday it was MLA,

46
00:07:40,115 --> 00:07:41,612
today it was Sports Minister himself.

47
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:44,897
He announced Rs.50 lakhs cash
and 1000 yards plot.

48
00:07:45,064 --> 00:07:46,895
Your father came immediately
and spoiled everything,

49
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:49,967
You would've settled in life, nephew.
- Yes, uncle.

50
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:53,105
Those flowers, money, crowd,
amidst them me!

51
00:07:53,272 --> 00:07:54,967
We next to you.

52
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:57,006
Why don't you say anything?
- Aren't we there?

53
00:07:57,076 --> 00:08:00,603
What's this?
Can I be there without you?

54
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:03,214
Dream or reality,
we are always together.

55
00:08:03,549 --> 00:08:05,642
Where ever I'm, you're there!

56
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:08,048
Wherever you are, I'm there!

57
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:09,518
Thanks, nephew.

58
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:12,021
Did you introduce us to the Minister?

59
00:08:12,191 --> 00:08:13,954
Did he shake hands with us?

60
00:08:14,126 --> 00:08:16,754
It didn't happen, uncle,
you were all very busy.

61
00:08:16,929 --> 00:08:19,295
We were signing autographs
for the fans, right?

62
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:24,568
Did we play band?

63
00:08:24,737 --> 00:08:27,228
You travel in flights by
becoming a player,

64
00:08:27,573 --> 00:08:30,906
we'll clap for you and
play band celebrating your victory.

65
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:32,169
Not like that, uncle.

66
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:33,945
Stop!

67
00:08:34,113 --> 00:08:36,013
Thank God your father came
at right time,

68
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:38,946
not only play band,
you'll make us carry slippers too.

69
00:08:39,118 --> 00:08:41,018
Leave us alone, come on boys.

70
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:44,189
Why are you going away?
Don't you want a party?

71
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:48,119
We must get back something
for playing band, right?

72
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:49,688
Let's split after the party.

73
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:53,195
He's my mother's cousin brother.
My maternal uncle.

74
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:57,025
I'm calling him informally
we grew up and roam together

75
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,932
They are my friends.

76
00:09:04,576 --> 00:09:08,103
My father, retired MRO.
He hates sitting doing nothing.

77
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:12,080
Anyone who needs something from
Govt. Office in my street comes to him.

78
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:14,150
Doing that work is his pass time.

79
00:09:15,186 --> 00:09:16,778
My elder brother, software engineer.

80
00:09:17,122 --> 00:09:18,987
Always connected to the laptop.

81
00:09:21,726 --> 00:09:23,751
My second brother,
Manager with a construction company,

82
00:09:24,095 --> 00:09:26,529
not only looks after the kids,
he does his wife's work too.

83
00:09:26,698 --> 00:09:28,598
This is common for this generation.

84
00:09:30,435 --> 00:09:33,495
She's my elder sister-in-law,
expert cook.

85
00:09:34,272 --> 00:09:37,764
Younger sister-in-law, expert eater.
Can't cook!

86
00:09:38,109 --> 00:09:40,805
They are my elder brother's daughter
and second brother's son.

87
00:09:41,746 --> 00:09:43,509
What's this?
Throwing clothes everywhere.

88
00:09:43,682 --> 00:09:47,049
Throwing shoes all over.
Is this any fish market?

89
00:09:47,218 --> 00:09:51,018
He's 25 years, still unmarried.
No work, no income.

90
00:09:51,189 --> 00:09:53,350
Never seen anyone more
indecent than him.

91
00:09:53,525 --> 00:09:55,789
You're talking too much.

92
00:09:56,127 --> 00:09:58,823
You're maid servant, be in your limits.

93
00:09:59,331 --> 00:10:00,125
I'll get you dismissed.

94
00:10:00,198 --> 00:10:03,690
Save yourself from getting thrown out,
I've better standing here than you.

95
00:10:04,035 --> 00:10:06,128
Name is Sridevi, takes too liberty
and keeps on advising.

96
00:10:06,304 --> 00:10:07,362
Pitched in firmly for 10 years.

97
00:10:07,539 --> 00:10:09,700
Not as a maid servant but
as member of our family.

98
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:13,575
Above all this a main character
in this home.

99
00:10:15,547 --> 00:10:18,710
What's this driving? Go fast.
- I'm going at top speed.

100
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:21,712
Useless auto.
Never seen anything junk like this.

101
00:10:22,053 --> 00:10:23,620
Why are you scolding?
Auto can't understand you.

102
00:10:23,688 --> 00:10:25,053
You should've some brain, right?

103
00:10:25,223 --> 00:10:27,555
Do you want to make easy
money with a junk auto?

104
00:10:27,726 --> 00:10:28,556
Idiot!

105
00:10:28,727 --> 00:10:31,719
Don't scold, I too can't understand it.

106
00:10:32,263 --> 00:10:34,788
Okay, go right.
- Okay.

107
00:10:36,801 --> 00:10:38,268
This is one way.

108
00:10:38,436 --> 00:10:40,461
I know, this is short cut to me, go.

109
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:43,403
Short cut to you but they'll cancel
my license and fine me heavily.

110
00:10:43,575 --> 00:10:48,239
Don't worry, the passenger in
your auto is DIG's daughter.

111
00:10:48,413 --> 00:10:51,143
If anyone dares stop me,
he'll lose his job.

112
00:10:51,316 --> 00:10:53,341
Is it madam?
Why didn't tell me that earlier?

113
00:10:53,518 --> 00:10:56,783
I can see SI there, I'll bang him.

114
00:10:57,122 --> 00:10:59,283
How dare he fines me!

115
00:10:59,457 --> 00:11:01,118
Clear that!
- Remove the bike.

116
00:11:01,292 --> 00:11:03,760
Everything is okay here, sir.

117
00:11:04,562 --> 00:11:05,586
Got it right!

118
00:11:06,131 --> 00:11:07,098
Who are you?

119
00:11:07,332 --> 00:11:09,732
You'll lose your jobs.

120
00:11:10,135 --> 00:11:11,568
Know my background first!

121
00:11:11,736 --> 00:11:14,170
What's that arrogance?

122
00:11:14,305 --> 00:11:16,170
Down... down...

123
00:11:16,408 --> 00:11:19,775
Even if your SI, CI, ASP, DSP,
or entire department comes,

124
00:11:20,111 --> 00:11:21,635
you can't even pull out my gear rod.

125
00:11:21,813 --> 00:11:26,273
Are you so proud?
- Not proud but power!

126
00:11:26,618 --> 00:11:28,381
Who is there in the seat?

127
00:11:28,553 --> 00:11:32,614
Nobody sir.- Nobody...?
- Is there...

128
00:11:38,797 --> 00:11:41,664
Should I see your background?

129
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:43,858
Can't anyone dare touch your gear box?

130
00:11:44,335 --> 00:11:48,294
Ensure that his gear box is shattered.

131
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:52,638
Please don't beat me.
I beg you, leave me.

132
00:12:06,825 --> 00:12:09,259
Father, I'm sure he'll get selected
to the national team.

133
00:12:09,427 --> 00:12:11,657
Forget about national team,
let him first join state team.

134
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:12,660
Where are the crowds?

135
00:12:12,831 --> 00:12:15,425
No use in supporting him,
find a job for him.

136
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,329
He'll live his own life.

137
00:12:29,247 --> 00:12:30,680
So much crowd?

138
00:12:31,349 --> 00:12:32,782
Did you see brother-in-law?

139
00:13:07,418 --> 00:13:09,409
Thanks brother.
Did I play well?

140
00:13:11,556 --> 00:13:12,352
Thanks sister-in-law.

141
00:13:12,524 --> 00:13:15,550
What you paid is for claps only,
I blew whistles too, pay extra.

142
00:13:15,727 --> 00:13:18,662
She insulted me in public again.

143
00:13:18,897 --> 00:13:20,228
Nephew...
- What's it uncle?

144
00:13:20,398 --> 00:13:25,563
Nephew, it's from your fan,
someone told me to give it to you.

145
00:13:26,504 --> 00:13:28,836
Do you've lady fans too?

146
00:13:58,536 --> 00:14:03,064
Hail Rama...

147
00:14:03,241 --> 00:14:05,266
Hail Rama the lord of universe...

148
00:14:05,443 --> 00:14:07,434
Hail Rama the star...

149
00:14:07,612 --> 00:14:12,072
Your blessings and grace
are our protection...

150
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:15,947
Bless us with your grace all our life...

151
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:20,454
We are different flowers
together like a garland...

152
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:25,085
Your love is the thread
that keeps all together...

153
00:14:25,263 --> 00:14:27,288
Rama, you're our God...

154
00:14:27,465 --> 00:14:29,456
Your shadow is kingdom of heaven...

155
00:14:29,634 --> 00:14:31,966
Your word is Veda to us...

156
00:14:32,136 --> 00:14:35,071
Your morals are our way of life...

157
00:15:11,642 --> 00:15:13,701
If affection is our companion...

158
00:15:14,045 --> 00:15:16,104
If bonds binds us together...

159
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:21,013
There won't be any differences
and the home will be a heaven...

160
00:15:21,118 --> 00:15:25,145
If happiness dwells in that
courtyard like a festoon...

161
00:15:25,323 --> 00:15:29,521
The fire of tiffs and arguments
have no place there...

162
00:15:29,694 --> 00:15:34,028
Lord Rama, you are our role model...

163
00:15:34,198 --> 00:15:38,760
Your Ramayana is for our sake only...

164
00:15:58,489 --> 00:16:02,391
If you follow me again, I'll kill you.

165
00:16:03,094 --> 00:16:04,823
Nephew, this time the trouble
is in shopping mall.

166
00:16:05,162 --> 00:16:06,686
Trouble again?

167
00:16:06,864 --> 00:16:08,456
What's the trouble? Who is he?

168
00:16:08,633 --> 00:16:11,864
I've solved my problem myself.

169
00:16:39,096 --> 00:16:41,189
Every day is a festival...

170
00:16:41,365 --> 00:16:43,390
A relative close to the heart...

171
00:16:43,567 --> 00:16:45,296
A day of care...

172
00:16:45,469 --> 00:16:47,801
This is silvery moonlight of love...

173
00:16:48,139 --> 00:16:50,266
Happiness is the heart beat...

174
00:16:50,441 --> 00:16:52,500
Fun forgotten by the time...

175
00:16:52,677 --> 00:16:54,542
We are together through
thick and thin...

176
00:16:54,712 --> 00:16:56,771
Our unity shows it...

177
00:16:57,114 --> 00:17:01,551
Don't know which life 's
good deeds ' result...

178
00:17:01,719 --> 00:17:06,179
Don't know which life 's
bond is continuing...

179
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:41,114
Let's meet evening in ground.

180
00:17:42,494 --> 00:17:44,052
Are you coming or not?

181
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:46,129
Stop... stop...

182
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:52,129
That girl! 5 batons broke!

183
00:17:58,076 --> 00:17:59,134
Trouble?

184
00:17:59,511 --> 00:18:02,105
He refused to switch on the meter,
I told him I'll tell my brother,

185
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:07,240
he abused me saying
whether he's any lord or king.

186
00:18:09,921 --> 00:18:12,253
Uncle, go with sister

187
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:14,392
Come, he's angry.

188
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:17,323
Blood will flow today,
you can't bear to see it.

189
00:18:38,316 --> 00:18:40,181
Boys! Take out the weapons!

190
00:18:49,861 --> 00:18:52,625
I'm going to college.
I fear he may kill him.

191
00:18:52,964 --> 00:18:54,622
Just tell him to stop with beating.
- Okay, you go.

192
00:18:54,866 --> 00:18:55,662
Leave me.

193
00:18:56,401 --> 00:19:00,064
Take it, just one shot and
head must break into two.

194
00:19:00,238 --> 00:19:04,299
Beat... beat brother.
- Should I beat you?

195
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:08,344
Fight is if two people beat each other,
come on beat me.

196
00:19:08,513 --> 00:19:10,481
Me? Beat you?

197
00:19:10,648 --> 00:19:11,910
Who do you think is an auto driver?

198
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:13,607
A worker in khaki dress.

199
00:19:13,952 --> 00:19:15,579
A member of the working class.

200
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:19,549
To say it simply,
a Basha... a Rajinikanth!

201
00:19:19,891 --> 00:19:23,224
Would I dare fight a man like Basha?
Isn't it too much?

202
00:19:27,565 --> 00:19:29,897
Tell me how much you lost,
I'll pay for it.

203
00:19:31,402 --> 00:19:34,303
Rs.500 for auto damage,
no Rs.2000.

204
00:19:34,472 --> 00:19:37,464
Rs.3000 for body damage,
total Rs.5000. Take it out.

205
00:19:37,575 --> 00:19:40,567
Take Rs.500 more, brother.

206
00:19:40,912 --> 00:19:44,404
If she creates any trouble,
give me a phone call, I'll pay for it.

207
00:19:44,582 --> 00:19:47,244
Please don't tell her anything.

208
00:19:48,253 --> 00:19:49,083
Okay.

209
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:51,254
Go.
- Okay?

210
00:19:51,623 --> 00:19:53,284
I, Basha is promising, you go.

211
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:56,689
Thanks brother, bye.
- Go.

212
00:19:57,028 --> 00:19:59,087
For calling him in Basha,
Rajinikanth must stop acting in films.

213
00:19:59,264 --> 00:20:04,725
He compromised, so no fight,
if not I would've shred him to pieces.

214
00:20:04,936 --> 00:20:07,598
Girl... girl...

215
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:28,289
He beat me!

216
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:32,052
You compromised with him
for your own sister,

217
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:35,256
why did you get so angry
for a girl you don't know?

218
00:20:35,433 --> 00:20:38,459
Her brother isn't here
to compromise, right?

219
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:39,628
Come.

220
00:20:48,179 --> 00:20:49,146
Father!

221
00:20:50,114 --> 00:20:52,309
I told you not to join that college.

222
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:54,083
You joined adamantly
without caring my advice,

223
00:20:54,152 --> 00:20:57,315
first term is not over and
you want to change the college.

224
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:01,483
Why are you looking around
without answering me?

225
00:21:01,659 --> 00:21:04,287
Waiting for him?
Waiting for his support?

226
00:21:04,462 --> 00:21:07,260
If he comes to your support,
I'll break his legs.

227
00:21:11,269 --> 00:21:13,499
We are not discussing about you,
go silently.

228
00:21:13,671 --> 00:21:16,504
Father, people who enter into
trouble that's not theirs,

229
00:21:16,674 --> 00:21:18,369
people who desire for things
that's not theirs,

230
00:21:18,543 --> 00:21:21,341
can never live peacefully. Bye.

231
00:21:21,646 --> 00:21:24,342
Nothing short in espousing
such useless philosophy.

232
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:27,013
Why are you still here? Go.

233
00:21:27,185 --> 00:21:29,346
Father, please listen to me...
- What will you say?

234
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,351
You've been doing only wrong things
even since you were 10,

235
00:21:31,522 --> 00:21:32,316
you ask for chocolates,

236
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:33,789
if I get it, you'll change
and for ice cream,

237
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:35,353
you ask for a bicycle to go to school,

238
00:21:35,526 --> 00:21:37,086
once I get it, you'll prefer
to go to in an auto,

239
00:21:37,128 --> 00:21:40,020
even in the food you eat, you're
confused and take wrong decisions,

240
00:21:40,198 --> 00:21:43,133
look, lights don't burn
if you switch on TV,

241
00:21:43,301 --> 00:21:45,360
if you keep on switching the
wrong buttons all your life,

242
00:21:45,536 --> 00:21:47,834
your life will be in wrong route only,
be careful.

243
00:21:48,172 --> 00:21:48,931
Have some water, father.

244
00:21:49,173 --> 00:21:51,232
You want me to stop this talk, right?
- Don't stop it, father.

245
00:21:51,409 --> 00:21:54,469
Drink water and continue.
Her fate!

246
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:56,204
If she had mother,
she would've wiped her tears,

247
00:21:57,315 --> 00:22:01,308
if mother was alive...
if mother was alive...

248
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:08,550
Thank you father.

249
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:09,822
Stop!

250
00:22:10,161 --> 00:22:12,152
Can you go to her In-laws place
and manage things?

251
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:14,525
So please try to reform her here.

252
00:22:14,699 --> 00:22:16,132
What's your next program?
- Going to ground...

253
00:22:16,301 --> 00:22:20,294
What else? Fill up the ball with air
and kick it around all the day.

254
00:22:20,471 --> 00:22:23,065
Clean the house not me.

255
00:22:23,341 --> 00:22:25,741
Won't you've breakfast?
- I'm already late.

256
00:22:34,085 --> 00:22:36,246
Bloody bike too for him!

257
00:22:36,721 --> 00:22:38,882
Hello madam, lift please!

258
00:22:45,129 --> 00:22:46,858
Lift?
- No problem.

259
00:22:47,231 --> 00:22:48,425
Where do you want to go?

260
00:22:49,334 --> 00:22:52,269
To football ground.
- Hop on.

261
00:22:54,839 --> 00:22:57,433
Make a note of today's date
and time in your diary.- Why?

262
00:22:57,608 --> 00:23:00,168
This will become an unforgettable day.
- Why?

263
00:23:00,345 --> 00:23:02,643
The man you're giving lift is
great football player Ramakrishna,

264
00:23:02,814 --> 00:23:06,545
just after an year you can
proudly claim to have given me lift.

265
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:09,278
Get down once.
- Why? You want my autograph?

266
00:23:09,454 --> 00:23:11,445
I said get down.

267
00:23:14,826 --> 00:23:19,388
Turn back and sit.
- Turn back?- Sit!

268
00:23:21,132 --> 00:23:23,327
People would laugh at us.

269
00:23:23,501 --> 00:23:26,834
They'll think we are lovers or
couple at loggerheads.

270
00:23:27,171 --> 00:23:29,332
Situation is very embarrassing.

271
00:23:29,507 --> 00:23:32,806
After a year, we need a topic
to discuss, right? No problem.

272
00:23:33,144 --> 00:23:34,236
My fate!

273
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:38,807
Why is he sitting like a kid?

274
00:23:44,322 --> 00:23:46,313
Stop here...

275
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:47,816
Thanks.

276
00:23:48,192 --> 00:23:51,753
Give me Rs.500.
- Why?

277
00:23:52,296 --> 00:23:53,354
For the lift.

278
00:23:53,531 --> 00:23:56,796
Rs.200 for petrol and Rs.300 for
listening to your banter. Pay!

279
00:23:57,402 --> 00:23:59,165
Your lift is very expensive.

280
00:24:00,872 --> 00:24:02,271
I've lost my purse.

281
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,465
I don't know if you'd become
a national player or not,

282
00:24:04,642 --> 00:24:06,576
but you've become
a good dialogue writer.

283
00:24:06,744 --> 00:24:10,339
Saying lost the purse. Okay.
Keep this Rs. 10.

284
00:24:10,515 --> 00:24:13,541
Thanks, you'll talk about
this too after a year.

285
00:24:13,718 --> 00:24:15,948
I can't banter like you.

286
00:24:40,344 --> 00:24:43,677
Come... come... how's the house?

287
00:24:43,848 --> 00:24:45,611
I love this place, grandpa.

288
00:24:45,783 --> 00:24:46,647
How is it?

289
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:49,252
Grandpa, I need a room for me
and my doll.

290
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:49,909
Okay... okay.

291
00:24:50,254 --> 00:24:53,985
Elder one, that's your room,
younger one that's your room,

292
00:24:54,325 --> 00:24:55,758
youngest one your room is upstairs,

293
00:24:55,927 --> 00:24:58,589
attached with bath, it'll be great.
- Thanks father.

294
00:24:58,763 --> 00:25:00,754
Why a separate room for him?
No wife or kids.

295
00:25:00,932 --> 00:25:04,231
He's always out with a ball,
any place is okay to him.

296
00:25:04,402 --> 00:25:07,269
You'll not get peace till you
throw me out of home,

297
00:25:07,438 --> 00:25:10,032
I'll not get peace till
I throw you out of this home.

298
00:25:10,374 --> 00:25:13,468
You're wrong, I'm very strong here.

299
00:25:13,644 --> 00:25:14,906
Stop your fight.

300
00:25:15,246 --> 00:25:17,680
You showed all our rooms,
where's Haritha's room father-in-law?

301
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:19,476
For her...
- Room for me?

302
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:22,585
Is this a home?
Do I need a room here?

303
00:25:22,987 --> 00:25:24,921
This entire home is smaller
than bathroom of my home.

304
00:25:25,256 --> 00:25:26,917
Do you've a home of your own?

305
00:25:27,258 --> 00:25:28,020
Where is it?

306
00:25:28,359 --> 00:25:32,853
If not now, I'll have one
after my marriage, right?

307
00:25:33,297 --> 00:25:35,595
A bug highway like road
from gate to the threshold,

308
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:39,769
a palatial bungalow,

309
00:25:42,807 --> 00:25:45,605
four cars in the portico,

310
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:48,436
house full of servants,

311
00:25:49,413 --> 00:25:51,347
a guest house too for you
to stay when you visit me.

312
00:26:25,316 --> 00:26:26,681
How are you doing uncle?

313
00:26:26,851 --> 00:26:27,783
Going on.

314
00:26:27,952 --> 00:26:30,477
Looks like you've lost weight.
- No, I'm fine.

315
00:26:30,655 --> 00:26:31,417
What brings you here?

316
00:26:31,589 --> 00:26:35,650
People like you're correct
to solve our problems.

317
00:26:35,826 --> 00:26:38,852
.What's your problem?
- Not much of a problem.

318
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:42,796
The house you brought newly,
I want to bring it down.

319
00:26:42,967 --> 00:26:44,764
Bring it down? Why?

320
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:48,372
We paid for it fully.
- I'm not denying it.

321
00:26:48,539 --> 00:26:50,006
But I'm in trouble over a problem.

322
00:26:50,341 --> 00:26:55,711
I made a commitment of
allotting a place for park, uncle,

323
00:26:55,880 --> 00:27:00,874
suddenly when prices zoomed to
Rs.1 crore, I forgot about the park,

324
00:27:01,052 --> 00:27:04,920
other owners are refusing
to pay till I build the park.

325
00:27:05,089 --> 00:27:07,057
I'll lose my money, right uncle?

326
00:27:07,391 --> 00:27:08,881
You tell me.
- So?

327
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:10,027
Will you dismantle our house?

328
00:27:10,361 --> 00:27:12,921
Don't get so serious,
look at my background.

329
00:27:13,097 --> 00:27:15,964
I'm not asking you for free,
I'll pay you extra also.

330
00:27:16,133 --> 00:27:17,623
Did you get us amongst all of them?

331
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:21,135
Only people with respect
fear for threats,

332
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:25,033
when I searched the list,
I found you were the best, uncle.

333
00:27:25,376 --> 00:27:27,139
So what?
Will you threaten and dismantle it?

334
00:27:27,478 --> 00:27:28,945
Come on do it I say, let me see.

335
00:27:29,113 --> 00:27:30,574
Brother... brother... wait.

336
00:27:30,648 --> 00:27:32,407
Are you able to grasp
situation's seriousness, brother?

337
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:34,008
Look at those vehicles,
look at their bodies.

338
00:27:34,185 --> 00:27:35,743
Can we beat them?

339
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,717
If they ask, we must give
this house too.

340
00:27:37,888 --> 00:27:39,048
Stay out of this, go in.

341
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:41,585
Father, you go inside.
- What the hell he's saying?

342
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:43,886
You go inside, I'll talk to him.

343
00:27:46,197 --> 00:27:48,893
No fights please, do as you wish.

344
00:27:49,066 --> 00:27:52,160
Come, I'll manage my people.

345
00:27:52,703 --> 00:27:56,070
Brothers, please go.
Matter is settled. Sir, you too!

346
00:27:58,142 --> 00:28:00,133
Thank you brother.

347
00:28:01,112 --> 00:28:03,080
You scared shit out of him, brother.

348
00:28:03,414 --> 00:28:05,848
Few more minutes and
I would've wetted my pants.

349
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:07,484
How come?

350
00:28:07,652 --> 00:28:09,176
When he touches me...

351
00:28:13,791 --> 00:28:15,759
I realized when he touched me,

352
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:17,857
anyone would die if he beats.

353
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:22,159
We can buy property but not life.
Come.

354
00:28:25,903 --> 00:28:27,894
Keep quiet brother,
you never listen to me.

355
00:28:28,072 --> 00:28:29,036
I would've killed him there.

356
00:28:29,106 --> 00:28:31,370
You don't know, calm down.
- No brother.

357
00:28:39,383 --> 00:28:42,546
Brother, he has come here directly.
- Stop!

358
00:28:49,893 --> 00:28:51,588
Come uncle, sit here.

359
00:28:54,498 --> 00:28:56,557
Why this threats and warns, uncle?

360
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:59,130
Losing money to feed and
maintain these goons,

361
00:28:59,303 --> 00:29:00,827
and paying for their petrol too,

362
00:29:01,005 --> 00:29:05,465
after all this if I beat you now,
no one here has guts to stop me.

363
00:29:05,843 --> 00:29:10,303
Matter is settled there,
why did you come here to create trouble?

364
00:29:10,481 --> 00:29:12,478
If I beat you there,
my people would start

365
00:29:12,479 --> 00:29:14,474
picking up trouble
thinking I'll save them,

366
00:29:14,818 --> 00:29:18,481
if I leave, you'll go and threaten
many like us. Is it necessary?

367
00:29:18,822 --> 00:29:20,414
Then, will you beat him now?

368
00:29:20,824 --> 00:29:22,519
Bloody! What the hell
are you blabbering?

369
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:25,488
Don't stop me, I beg you.

370
00:29:25,829 --> 00:29:27,553
I'll take it if he calls you
coward boss, I'll take it,

371
00:29:27,631 --> 00:29:30,329
if he calls my gang of cowards,
I can't take it.

372
00:29:30,501 --> 00:29:32,833
Please don't stop me, brother.
- You go inside.

373
00:29:33,003 --> 00:29:37,269
You go inside.
- I beg you, I'll fall at your feet.

374
00:29:37,441 --> 00:29:40,171
Sit inside and
watch breaking news on TV.

375
00:29:40,344 --> 00:29:44,110
I'll shred him to pieces and
give him in a bag.

376
00:29:44,281 --> 00:29:47,011
You go inside.
- You don't know about him.

377
00:29:47,184 --> 00:29:50,017
Hey, close the gate.

378
00:29:50,854 --> 00:29:55,348
Bloody! What's this?
Did you see him? How small he is?

379
00:29:55,526 --> 00:29:56,288
Tiny tot!

380
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:59,258
Would anyone use power of man for a kid?

381
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:00,226
Do you've any sense?

382
00:30:00,397 --> 00:30:03,889
Raise hand like this,
turn it into fist like this,

383
00:30:04,068 --> 00:30:06,298
take it back and punch straight
into his stomach,

384
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:09,337
the bloody idiot must throw up
his intestines, you know?

385
00:30:09,506 --> 00:30:10,666
Now, go.

386
00:31:07,097 --> 00:31:08,086
Brother!

387
00:31:49,106 --> 00:31:53,475
Brother... brother...
open the door, I beg you.

388
00:32:05,355 --> 00:32:08,654
Brother! He's bashing us up!

389
00:32:08,992 --> 00:32:10,152
Come uncle.

390
00:32:10,394 --> 00:32:12,589
Come, let's discuss.

391
00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:15,564
Uncle, it's wrong for you
to desire to live,

392
00:32:15,732 --> 00:32:19,327
but it's wrong to disturb others' lives,
love the neighbour,

393
00:32:19,503 --> 00:32:21,198
you'll understand how wrong
it is to threaten them,

394
00:32:21,371 --> 00:32:24,704
look uncle, if you pay
you may get many people to kill,

395
00:32:25,042 --> 00:32:27,806
but only those who love you would
dare sacrifice their life for you.

396
00:32:36,053 --> 00:32:39,580
Don't take it easy and try again,
I love my family.

397
00:32:39,756 --> 00:32:41,690
If I decide to keep
quiet for their safety,

398
00:32:42,025 --> 00:32:45,654
I'll bow before anyone,
if fight is inevitable,

399
00:32:45,829 --> 00:32:49,128
10, 25, 50, 100,
the count is your patience,

400
00:32:49,299 --> 00:32:51,130
come with as many goons as possible,

401
00:32:51,301 --> 00:32:54,361
I'll stand tall till my head rolls down.

402
00:33:04,414 --> 00:33:05,540
Justice is on our side,

403
00:33:05,716 --> 00:33:07,707
we've courts and laws
to safe guard us.

404
00:33:08,051 --> 00:33:10,576
Why did you go to their house
and beat them like a goon?

405
00:33:10,754 --> 00:33:12,722
I told you he'll bring trouble
to this home,

406
00:33:13,056 --> 00:33:14,717
now he has brought big trouble.

407
00:33:15,058 --> 00:33:18,050
If he comes with 100 goons now,
what will happen to these people?

408
00:33:18,228 --> 00:33:19,718
Greetings uncle.
- Greetings sir.

409
00:33:20,063 --> 00:33:22,827
Please forgive me.
- Please don't say it.

410
00:33:23,166 --> 00:33:25,600
In fact you must forgive us for my son
creating trouble in your home.

411
00:33:25,769 --> 00:33:27,236
Nothing like that.

412
00:33:27,404 --> 00:33:33,673
I don't know if I liked your fight, face
or the lesson you gave me,

413
00:33:33,844 --> 00:33:38,247
my daughter has told me, she'll marry
only you if she ever marries.

414
00:33:38,415 --> 00:33:41,077
I said yes.
Please don't say no.

415
00:33:43,854 --> 00:33:48,257
All of you come to my house
and see my daughter.

416
00:33:48,458 --> 00:33:50,688
My son must also like her, right?

417
00:33:51,762 --> 00:33:54,196
Forget about the past incidents,

418
00:33:54,364 --> 00:33:57,527
I must be lucky to become
a kinsman to your family.

419
00:33:57,701 --> 00:34:01,603
Please meet my daughter.
Proceed further only if you like her.

420
00:34:02,539 --> 00:34:05,872
Meet tomorrow over lunch
in a restaurant.

421
00:34:06,176 --> 00:34:08,770
Brother-in-law, your
son is very soft man.

422
00:34:09,146 --> 00:34:11,307
You must send him.
- Okay.

423
00:34:11,481 --> 00:34:12,505
Bye.
- Okay.

424
00:34:12,683 --> 00:34:13,741
Bye.

425
00:34:15,352 --> 00:34:18,617
Meet her, if you like, it's okay,
say no if you don't like her.

426
00:34:18,789 --> 00:34:19,551
Just a small word.

427
00:34:19,723 --> 00:34:21,588
I'm saying without seeing her, no.

428
00:34:21,758 --> 00:34:24,283
Will you get Katrina Kaif
for your football?- You...

429
00:34:24,461 --> 00:34:27,624
Don't know how she had seen you.
You got lucky, agree.

430
00:34:28,131 --> 00:34:32,465
I'm telling you all,
I'm not marrying her.

431
00:34:46,383 --> 00:34:48,749
Please leave me.

432
00:34:56,193 --> 00:34:57,717
Who is it?
- Hello, it's me Suchithra.- Tell me.

433
00:34:57,894 --> 00:35:00,658
Restaurant program today, right?
- Yes.

434
00:35:00,831 --> 00:35:02,594
It's at 1 pm not at 2 pm.
- 1 pm, right?

435
00:35:02,766 --> 00:35:04,666
I'll mange it, sister.

436
00:35:05,602 --> 00:35:06,762
Who is it?

437
00:35:09,339 --> 00:35:10,328
You are...?

438
00:35:11,375 --> 00:35:13,366
Madam is waiting for you, sir.

439
00:35:18,281 --> 00:35:19,509
You are...?

440
00:35:20,751 --> 00:35:22,343
You gave me lift that day?

441
00:35:28,291 --> 00:35:31,351
I fell for you on that day itself.

442
00:35:31,561 --> 00:35:35,429
I liked your obedience of
sitting back when I asked,

443
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:41,231
I loved your daring attitude
of going against my father,

444
00:35:41,405 --> 00:35:43,339
that's why this marriage proposal.

445
00:35:43,507 --> 00:35:44,405
What would you like to have?

446
00:35:44,574 --> 00:35:47,702
I've already ordered,
I know you love biryani

447
00:35:47,878 --> 00:35:50,540
Who told you?
- Your father.

448
00:35:50,714 --> 00:35:52,705
You've ruined my life, dad.

449
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:54,983
What are you thinking?

450
00:35:55,819 --> 00:35:57,787
Do you like me?
Is my proposal okay?

451
00:35:57,954 --> 00:36:01,390
You were bantering like hell that day,
why are you shying to talk today?

452
00:36:01,558 --> 00:36:02,889
Is it okay to you?

453
00:36:03,226 --> 00:36:05,387
Will you say this also after a year?

454
00:36:05,595 --> 00:36:08,428
What?
- Nephew, don't forget biryani.

455
00:36:08,598 --> 00:36:10,395
I said okay, right?

456
00:36:11,368 --> 00:36:15,236
Why?- You said okay to your people
instead of telling me.

457
00:36:15,405 --> 00:36:17,896
That is...
- No problem.

458
00:36:18,241 --> 00:36:20,232
We'll meet every day,
take your own time to say yes.

459
00:36:20,410 --> 00:36:21,900
No, you've mistaken me...

460
00:36:24,581 --> 00:36:25,570
Have it.

461
00:36:39,496 --> 00:36:40,758
Biryani was great, right?

462
00:36:41,264 --> 00:36:42,060
Your daddy.

463
00:36:42,532 --> 00:36:43,294
Tell me uncle.

464
00:36:43,467 --> 00:36:44,934
It seems you didn't meet my daughter.

465
00:36:45,268 --> 00:36:49,261
No uncle, we are together now.
- Don't joke with me.

466
00:36:49,439 --> 00:36:52,431
My daughter is waiting for you
at table number 10.

467
00:37:03,553 --> 00:37:04,611
Fool!

468
00:37:06,656 --> 00:37:08,453
Hey you!

469
00:37:17,501 --> 00:37:18,798
Oh God!

470
00:37:19,836 --> 00:37:20,894
Thanks for coming.

471
00:37:21,071 --> 00:37:24,063
I've already ordered,
you love biryani, right?

472
00:37:24,407 --> 00:37:27,308
Your father told me.
- Did he tell you also?

473
00:37:30,447 --> 00:37:31,414
Is my proposal okay to you?

474
00:37:31,581 --> 00:37:32,980
Please don't forget biryani.

475
00:37:33,316 --> 00:37:35,113
Okay!
- Okay?

476
00:37:42,626 --> 00:37:43,650
Okay?

477
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:44,722
Okay?

478
00:37:44,895 --> 00:37:45,759
Okay?

479
00:37:45,929 --> 00:37:46,987
Okay?

480
00:37:47,330 --> 00:37:47,989
Okay?

481
00:37:48,331 --> 00:37:49,320
Okay?

482
00:37:49,533 --> 00:37:50,932
Okay?

483
00:37:51,134 --> 00:37:52,795
Uncle, I'm booked.

484
00:37:52,969 --> 00:37:54,798
I didn't meet the girl I should
and but met another girl.

485
00:37:54,871 --> 00:37:56,532
She smashed a goal
without my knowledge.

486
00:37:56,706 --> 00:37:58,867
Don't worry, shift to her side.

487
00:37:59,042 --> 00:38:01,010
I'll beat you,
you're responsible for this.

488
00:38:01,344 --> 00:38:03,005
She called you and
you informed about the program.

489
00:38:03,346 --> 00:38:05,371
She considers me as her own brother.

490
00:38:05,549 --> 00:38:08,712
No, she considered you as a broker.
Bloody broker.

491
00:38:08,885 --> 00:38:13,345
Are you calling me a broker?
What did I take from you?

492
00:38:13,523 --> 00:38:17,015
Money? Drinks?
At least left over biryani?

493
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,055
How dare you call me broker!

494
00:38:19,396 --> 00:38:23,958
I'll tell everyone that you're
playing double game.

495
00:38:24,134 --> 00:38:26,534
Bloody, you're finished today.
- I went overboard in emotion.

496
00:38:26,703 --> 00:38:29,866
How dare you accuse me.
Stop... stop...

497
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:33,373
Till now no short man was
ever caught by a tall man.- Stop!

498
00:38:33,543 --> 00:38:34,703
Oh no! It's him.

499
00:38:34,878 --> 00:38:35,708
Hey you stop!

500
00:38:35,879 --> 00:38:36,709
Hey you!

501
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:38,379
Stop girl?

502
00:38:38,515 --> 00:38:41,040
Not me... not me...
- Stop... stop...

503
00:38:46,723 --> 00:38:47,712
Stop!

504
00:38:52,963 --> 00:38:53,725
Stop.

505
00:38:56,533 --> 00:38:57,557
What?

506
00:38:58,702 --> 00:39:02,194
How dare you spoil my
life for biryani...

507
00:39:11,448 --> 00:39:13,211
You've turned the home into a museum.

508
00:39:13,717 --> 00:39:16,481
Did you find my items to steal?
Are you mad?

509
00:39:16,653 --> 00:39:19,554
Yes, I'm mad.
I'm mad in love with you.

510
00:39:19,723 --> 00:39:22,624
I was present in every football
match you played.

511
00:39:22,792 --> 00:39:27,695
I used to arrange paid crowds
for your matches.

512
00:39:28,965 --> 00:39:32,423
I took a ball you kicked
out side while practicing.

513
00:39:32,702 --> 00:39:34,897
When your gang didn't
get tickets to the film,

514
00:39:35,071 --> 00:39:36,766
I brought tickets in black,

515
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:39,204
and ensured that you sit next to me,

516
00:39:39,542 --> 00:39:43,103
while you were watching the film,
I was watching you & enjoying, you know?

517
00:39:44,948 --> 00:39:47,178
I flattened your bike tyre,
and offered you lift,

518
00:39:47,517 --> 00:39:49,610
and made you sit turning back side,

519
00:39:49,786 --> 00:39:52,448
picked your pocket and
enjoyed it, you know that?

520
00:39:52,789 --> 00:39:55,622
I stole this T-shirt from your house.

521
00:39:55,792 --> 00:39:59,626
I spent a year of my life following
you like your shadow.- Why?

522
00:39:59,796 --> 00:40:03,527
I told you I'm madly in love with you.
You're my life.

523
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:06,168
I always wanted to express
my love to you.

524
00:40:06,503 --> 00:40:10,030
But I was afraid that I may not
be able to take your rejection.

525
00:40:10,206 --> 00:40:12,572
For that will you cheat my coming
in place of another girl?

526
00:40:12,742 --> 00:40:14,232
Yes, I didn't have choice.

527
00:40:14,577 --> 00:40:18,069
How can I keep quiet if you're
getting ready to marry another girl?

528
00:40:18,481 --> 00:40:20,813
In your life if there's any girl,
it must be only me.

529
00:40:20,984 --> 00:40:22,975
I'll not accept anyone else.

530
00:40:23,186 --> 00:40:26,883
Look, love from my side is perfect.

531
00:40:27,057 --> 00:40:28,888
What about you? Do you like me?
Do you love me?

532
00:41:06,229 --> 00:41:08,493
What's happening to my heart?

533
00:41:08,832 --> 00:41:11,096
I'm lost in myth...

534
00:41:11,267 --> 00:41:13,735
Where ever I see...

535
00:41:13,903 --> 00:41:16,133
Her love is watching me...

536
00:41:16,306 --> 00:41:21,107
This is not loneliness...

537
00:41:21,277 --> 00:41:28,080
A half of me is melting and
rebelling against me...

538
00:41:28,918 --> 00:41:33,548
Not just in any place...

539
00:41:33,890 --> 00:41:40,557
Your heart is chasing like shadow
and stealing my heart...

540
00:41:41,397 --> 00:41:46,198
My heart is searching you
before me...

541
00:41:46,369 --> 00:41:51,238
Time is standing still and
made me it's prisoner...

542
00:41:51,407 --> 00:41:56,242
I'm seeing the world newly
and becoming an infant...

543
00:41:56,412 --> 00:42:01,213
What am I to say if anything happens...

544
00:42:01,384 --> 00:42:06,447
I'm there for my heart...

545
00:42:21,938 --> 00:42:24,168
It has trapped me and
taking my life...

546
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:26,900
Love in my heart...

547
00:42:27,076 --> 00:42:29,044
I'm breathless...
I'm struggling to breathe...

548
00:42:29,212 --> 00:42:31,271
Love at this moment...

549
00:42:31,447 --> 00:42:33,915
Like a small gift...
like first celebration of life...

550
00:42:34,083 --> 00:42:36,517
Love is taking first steps...

551
00:42:36,853 --> 00:42:41,586
Love is spoiling me with
yes or no dilemma...

552
00:42:41,925 --> 00:42:46,362
Searching for wings
as rain drops fall on earth...

553
00:42:46,529 --> 00:42:49,191
Closing the eyelids to stop entry...

554
00:42:49,365 --> 00:42:51,629
Can it stop the heart's movement?

555
00:42:51,968 --> 00:42:56,598
Thoughts are soaring high
into sky to touch stars...

556
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:59,170
Though I was here till yesterday...

557
00:42:59,342 --> 00:43:02,175
From today I'm someone else...

558
00:43:22,031 --> 00:43:24,329
Earth is floating...
Able to touch the sky...

559
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:26,866
What's this wonder thing love...

560
00:43:27,036 --> 00:43:29,300
Breeze is striking me...
there's affection in air...

561
00:43:29,472 --> 00:43:31,531
What's this magic of love...

562
00:43:31,874 --> 00:43:36,868
Love is drenching my heart...

563
00:43:37,046 --> 00:43:41,881
Love is pacifying like
a mother's lullaby...

564
00:43:42,051 --> 00:43:46,886
I'm lonely even in a crowd...

565
00:43:47,056 --> 00:43:51,891
Though youth wants to rebel,
unable to cross the barrier of heart...

566
00:43:52,061 --> 00:43:56,896
Though hidden between the lips,
unable to find the words...

567
00:43:57,066 --> 00:44:02,402
Though getting hurt seriously,
not a squirm from heart...

568
00:44:47,984 --> 00:44:48,916
Please come in.

569
00:44:50,253 --> 00:44:52,278
What's this sudden visit with luggage?

570
00:44:52,455 --> 00:44:55,788
I've to stay here for a week or a month,
do you've any problem?

571
00:44:55,958 --> 00:44:57,858
Why would I've any problem with you?

572
00:44:58,027 --> 00:45:00,757
See that you don't have
any problem with me.

573
00:45:14,410 --> 00:45:16,935
Did you see his hairstyle, uncle?
- Not that great.

574
00:45:17,847 --> 00:45:19,781
You're selected for nationals.

575
00:45:21,784 --> 00:45:24,116
Thanks buddy.

576
00:45:25,054 --> 00:45:26,282
Look there!

577
00:45:27,790 --> 00:45:28,586
Come.

578
00:45:29,392 --> 00:45:30,359
Who is it now?

579
00:45:30,526 --> 00:45:33,086
Minister's son Jayaraj?
- Minister's son?

580
00:45:33,262 --> 00:45:33,990
What's the matter?

581
00:45:34,163 --> 00:45:36,290
I didn't say anything,
he asked me to get on his bike,

582
00:45:36,465 --> 00:45:38,296
I said no, for that he...

583
00:45:38,467 --> 00:45:43,837
He abused me using
choicest epithets, right?

584
00:45:44,006 --> 00:45:45,234
You guessed it right, brother.

585
00:45:45,408 --> 00:45:48,138
You go home, I'll take care of him.

586
00:45:53,816 --> 00:45:54,441
You stay here.

587
00:45:54,617 --> 00:45:56,517
So arrogance though
he's Minister's son.

588
00:45:56,852 --> 00:45:58,820
Arrogance must come down.

589
00:46:00,356 --> 00:46:03,291
Shankar, at least 25000 people
must gather this time.

590
00:46:03,459 --> 00:46:05,984
We are here, we'll take care of it.
- Greetings sir.

591
00:46:06,262 --> 00:46:07,593
What's it? What do you want?

592
00:46:07,930 --> 00:46:09,659
Small matter sir, it
seems your son invited

593
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:11,388
my sister to get into the vehicle.

594
00:46:11,567 --> 00:46:13,967
So what?
Are you here to fight with me?

595
00:46:14,136 --> 00:46:17,503
Fight? Me? I'm scared of fights.

596
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:19,205
I came here just to say sorry.

597
00:46:19,375 --> 00:46:22,503
We don't accept sorry,
it seems she abused him wildly,

598
00:46:22,845 --> 00:46:24,073
why is she so arrogant?

599
00:46:24,246 --> 00:46:28,012
If he gets into mood,
he'll kidnap her, warn her.

600
00:46:28,417 --> 00:46:32,251
We go to market, we see jasmine,
won't we bargain?

601
00:46:32,421 --> 00:46:34,582
We mangoes, won't we ask the rate?
- Why not?

602
00:46:34,924 --> 00:46:38,257
This is also same.
Is it wrong to buy something we like?

603
00:46:38,427 --> 00:46:39,519
Not at all wrong, sir.

604
00:46:39,862 --> 00:46:42,660
We are buying votes,
jasmine and mangoes are nothing.

605
00:46:44,066 --> 00:46:47,160
But she's a girl,
you mustn't ask her rate sir.

606
00:46:47,336 --> 00:46:49,304
Everyone won't be soft like me, right?

607
00:46:50,139 --> 00:46:54,405
If anyone gets angry and stabs him,
it's difficult to buy life, right sir?

608
00:46:54,577 --> 00:46:57,307
Are you threatening me.
- No, showing affection, sir.

609
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:01,041
There's a board near my house which
says long live youth leader Jayaraj.

610
00:47:01,217 --> 00:47:03,947
If your son dies,
will that board be of any use?

611
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:07,556
We can put jasmine garland to it,
but can't make him eat mango, right?

612
00:47:07,890 --> 00:47:10,085
Your son must live 100 years,
that's my worry.

613
00:47:10,259 --> 00:47:15,891
Long live leader of youth Jayaraj!
- Long live!

614
00:47:16,065 --> 00:47:16,690
Okay go.

615
00:47:17,033 --> 00:47:18,898
It means you've forgiven
my sister, right?

616
00:47:19,068 --> 00:47:20,433
You say there's a board
on your compound,

617
00:47:20,603 --> 00:47:24,334
I'll tell my son, you go now..
- Bye sir.

618
00:47:24,507 --> 00:47:30,673
Don't let her be seen often by him.
He doesn't know himself his mood swings.

619
00:47:31,013 --> 00:47:33,675
He's mental.
- Okay sir.

620
00:47:34,717 --> 00:47:37,447
I thought you'll make his son shout
in pain but you made me hail him.

621
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:38,348
Can't avoid it.

622
00:47:38,521 --> 00:47:42,423
If we go on picking fights,
they may harm Haritha in retaliation.

623
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:44,957
If risk is mine, I'll face death also.

624
00:47:45,127 --> 00:47:48,255
If she's at risk, I'll
bow before anyone.

625
00:47:48,431 --> 00:47:49,591
She's my mother.

626
00:47:50,332 --> 00:47:54,200
I thought I'm putting a full stop to
every wrong button she presses,

627
00:47:54,370 --> 00:47:57,737
but she's going on putting commas.

628
00:48:01,510 --> 00:48:02,374
Come, son-in-law.

629
00:48:02,545 --> 00:48:07,278
The time we fought is really lucky
to get our families closer.

630
00:48:07,450 --> 00:48:09,611
My son liked your sister very much.

631
00:48:09,952 --> 00:48:11,249
We are here to seek
her hand in marriage.

632
00:48:11,420 --> 00:48:13,615
What do you say, brother-in-law?
- Yes... yes...

633
00:48:15,224 --> 00:48:18,125
Looks like your father gave
birth to you for them only.

634
00:48:18,594 --> 00:48:20,186
Plan something, nephew.

635
00:48:20,362 --> 00:48:22,956
No need, this marriage will not happen.
- Why?

636
00:48:23,132 --> 00:48:24,690
He doesn't have a moustache.

637
00:48:27,069 --> 00:48:27,760
I'll come in a moment.

638
00:48:28,003 --> 00:48:28,628
Okay.

639
00:48:28,971 --> 00:48:31,565
Did you see him?
Do you like him?

640
00:48:31,741 --> 00:48:32,673
What's that question?

641
00:48:33,008 --> 00:48:35,033
Would she allow to keep flowers
in hair if she doesn't like him?

642
00:48:35,211 --> 00:48:39,170
Your sister wished for a big bungalow,
cars and plenty of servants, right?

643
00:48:39,348 --> 00:48:41,976
Now she got one, would she say no?
Come let's go.

644
00:48:42,151 --> 00:48:44,312
Think over it again.
He doesn't have a moustache.

645
00:48:44,487 --> 00:48:45,511
You hate such men, right?

646
00:48:45,688 --> 00:48:48,418
That's not a big deal,
moustache can grow in 15 days.

647
00:48:48,591 --> 00:48:49,785
You come.

648
00:48:50,025 --> 00:48:50,684
Move aside.

649
00:48:51,026 --> 00:48:54,154
It's okay for your marriage but
finding faults for sister's marriage.

650
00:48:56,699 --> 00:49:00,191
She comes to me for any problem,
but for marriage,

651
00:49:00,369 --> 00:49:01,358
never even bothered to tell me,

652
00:49:01,537 --> 00:49:02,526
moreover says she likes him,

653
00:49:02,705 --> 00:49:04,172
he's so handsome, isn't he?

654
00:49:10,646 --> 00:49:13,513
Stop... stop...
What are you doing here?

655
00:49:13,682 --> 00:49:16,583
Our love isn't moving,
I wanted to give it a push.

656
00:49:16,752 --> 00:49:21,018
Is your father there?
- Stop... stop... come with me.

657
00:49:21,290 --> 00:49:23,019
Come... come.

658
00:49:23,292 --> 00:49:26,022
Already I'm in trouble,
why are you bringing some more?

659
00:49:26,195 --> 00:49:27,628
What's that photo?
Why are we with garlands?

660
00:49:27,797 --> 00:49:28,593
Are you mad?

661
00:49:28,764 --> 00:49:31,232
I wanted to insert a child between us,
didn't get a good photo.

662
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:32,196
I'll beat you.

663
00:49:32,368 --> 00:49:33,392
Are you angry?

664
00:49:33,569 --> 00:49:36,060
I've been following you for a year,
say yes or no?

665
00:49:36,238 --> 00:49:36,795
If I say no.

666
00:49:37,139 --> 00:49:39,699
I'll show them proof that
our first night is also over.

667
00:49:40,042 --> 00:49:41,703
No use talking to you...
father-in-law...

668
00:49:42,044 --> 00:49:43,773
If I say yes.

669
00:49:47,850 --> 00:49:49,147
I mean if I say yes.

670
00:49:49,318 --> 00:49:53,345
Good, you'll settle this problem
and marry me.

671
00:49:53,522 --> 00:49:57,549
I've that hope because you're a man.

672
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:20,114
Uncle, I can't take it anymore.

673
00:50:20,282 --> 00:50:22,147
I must tell my people clearly
about my love.

674
00:50:22,318 --> 00:50:24,081
How? They are fixed about this marriage.

675
00:50:24,253 --> 00:50:26,744
But still if I don't tell now
and wait till marriage,

676
00:50:27,089 --> 00:50:28,613
it'll be blow into a big problem.

677
00:50:28,791 --> 00:50:31,885
My love mustn't disturb
my sister's marriage.

678
00:50:32,228 --> 00:50:34,753
I'm not here drunk to
blabber nonsense.

679
00:50:35,097 --> 00:50:37,292
I saw your son going out
with another girl.

680
00:50:37,466 --> 00:50:40,264
I don't believe my son would
do that even if you say so.

681
00:50:40,436 --> 00:50:42,563
Did I see any film poster then?

682
00:50:42,738 --> 00:50:45,764
I don't buy an inch of land
without checking documents,

683
00:50:46,108 --> 00:50:47,439
but I fell for my
daughter's sentiment and

684
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:48,770
failed to check your family document,

685
00:50:49,111 --> 00:50:52,740
that's my mistake,
your son build structure without cement.

686
00:50:52,915 --> 00:50:55,611
You're in haste, even if my son
does commit a mistake,

687
00:50:55,784 --> 00:50:56,748
he'll tell us before doing it.

688
00:50:56,819 --> 00:50:59,788
Why are you still supporting him?
Are you his father or broker?

689
00:51:00,122 --> 00:51:03,114
Don't wag your tongue.
Mind your words.

690
00:51:03,292 --> 00:51:05,556
Shut up.
Nothing short in getting angry.

691
00:51:05,728 --> 00:51:09,630
He's here, ask him,
if he'll tell truth or false.

692
00:51:09,798 --> 00:51:11,663
What's this son?
Is he telling truth?

693
00:51:11,834 --> 00:51:13,301
Who is that girl?

694
00:51:14,136 --> 00:51:16,866
Don't hesitate, tell them clearly.

695
00:51:17,206 --> 00:51:19,606
Will you marry my daughter
and take her as concubine?

696
00:51:19,775 --> 00:51:22,471
Or else marry her and take
my daughter as concubine?

697
00:51:22,578 --> 00:51:24,842
Why don't you answer, son?
- Father!

698
00:51:25,180 --> 00:51:26,579
Father! Haritha is missing.
- What happened?

699
00:51:26,749 --> 00:51:28,407
She went into the trial room
in the cloth showroom.

700
00:51:28,417 --> 00:51:31,252
She didn't come out.
I tried her phone but it's switched off.

701
00:51:32,521 --> 00:51:35,854
So her daughter too has a page
in their document.

702
00:51:36,191 --> 00:51:39,217
Good we came to know about
her character before marriage.

703
00:51:39,395 --> 00:51:43,832
Anyway she's his sister, I'm sure
she'd have eloped with some man.

704
00:51:44,867 --> 00:51:47,569
Just because I'm silent
if you abuse me,

705
00:51:47,570 --> 00:51:50,271
if you dare comment my
sister, you'll die.

706
00:51:50,439 --> 00:51:54,432
Learn to talk respectfully.
- What respect?

707
00:51:54,610 --> 00:51:57,636
No fights please. I beg you sir.

708
00:51:57,813 --> 00:51:59,508
I'm well respected here sir.

709
00:51:59,682 --> 00:52:01,343
Please don't make me
bow my head in shame.

710
00:52:01,517 --> 00:52:03,348
Please I beg you.
- Father, no...- Keep quiet.

711
00:52:03,519 --> 00:52:05,214
First check with whom your
daughter has eloped.

712
00:52:05,387 --> 00:52:06,513
I'll hack you, bloody.
- Stop!

713
00:52:06,689 --> 00:52:10,284
Decide later to kill yourself
or get spat by people.

714
00:52:10,459 --> 00:52:12,689
Go man! Come.

715
00:52:14,263 --> 00:52:15,525
Father... father...
- Father-in-law!

716
00:52:15,698 --> 00:52:18,360
What happened, father?
- He... he...

717
00:52:19,268 --> 00:52:20,929
Call ambulance.

718
00:52:57,606 --> 00:53:01,406
Haritha? In love?
Nobody has guts to talk to her also.

719
00:53:44,620 --> 00:53:46,952
Why did you come to me?

720
00:53:47,289 --> 00:53:49,951
My sister is missing,
did you do anything as revenge?

721
00:53:50,292 --> 00:53:54,285
No... no... I forgot you and your sister
that day seeing your punch.

722
00:53:54,463 --> 00:53:55,487
I'm innocent.

723
00:53:55,664 --> 00:53:58,656
If we see her anywhere,
we'll inform you.

724
00:53:58,834 --> 00:53:59,630
Please trust us.

725
00:54:00,703 --> 00:54:05,367
Don't let her be seen often by him.
He doesn't know himself his mood swings.

726
00:54:05,708 --> 00:54:07,266
He's mental.

727
00:54:12,781 --> 00:54:13,713
Greetings.
- Greetings.

728
00:54:13,882 --> 00:54:18,615
Party is fantastic.
- Have food, go.

729
00:54:30,399 --> 00:54:31,229
Where is my sister?

730
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:34,028
Today is my birthday,
everyone is enjoying happily,

731
00:54:34,203 --> 00:54:35,636
why are you troubling us?

732
00:54:36,805 --> 00:54:37,394
Where is your son?

733
00:54:37,639 --> 00:54:40,836
Trying to get smart with me?
I had warned you long back.

734
00:54:41,010 --> 00:54:42,739
He himself doesn't know his mood swings.

735
00:54:42,911 --> 00:54:46,142
He would've taken her,
he'll bring back her tomorrow. Go!

736
00:54:53,822 --> 00:54:57,155
Kill him boys!

737
00:55:24,853 --> 00:55:28,846
Tell me...where is your son?

738
00:55:41,136 --> 00:55:42,865
How dare you beat my father?

739
00:56:30,752 --> 00:56:33,243
Tell me... what have you done
with my sister?- I will...

740
00:56:34,323 --> 00:56:36,885
I don't know anything really,
I was in America for last 20 days,

741
00:56:36,959 --> 00:56:37,953
I came back today morning only.

742
00:56:38,026 --> 00:56:39,550
I swear on my mother,
I don't know anything.

743
00:56:39,895 --> 00:56:41,954
He's telling truth.
- I promise I'm innocent.

744
00:56:42,131 --> 00:56:44,292
He came back today only.
He's innocent, leave him.

745
00:56:44,466 --> 00:56:45,933
I'm innocent.

746
00:57:21,503 --> 00:57:25,200
What's my sin?
Why am I getting punished?

747
00:57:25,374 --> 00:57:28,502
I've a faint hope that
she's alive somewhere.

748
00:57:28,844 --> 00:57:35,844
We are worried you may kill
someone or get killed.

749
00:57:38,353 --> 00:57:42,813
Father is right, you toiled years
to become a player,

750
00:57:42,991 --> 00:57:47,121
but when opportunity is coming to you,
you're running madly on streets,

751
00:57:47,296 --> 00:57:48,820
what's this?

752
00:57:49,831 --> 00:57:51,298
Let bygones be bygones,

753
00:57:51,466 --> 00:57:55,300
Haritha will not come back
if you stop practicing.

754
00:57:55,470 --> 00:57:57,563
This is your last chance
to go to Delhi.

755
00:57:57,973 --> 00:58:01,500
Don't spoil your career unnecessarily.
Pack your bags.

756
00:58:02,644 --> 00:58:06,444
Listen to them,
we all want you to succeed in life.

757
00:58:06,615 --> 00:58:09,846
You must go at least for
the love of football.

758
00:58:12,454 --> 00:58:14,012
Why don't you answer them?

759
00:58:15,023 --> 00:58:16,354
We are talking to you.

760
00:58:17,025 --> 00:58:19,118
If you don't go, it's a promise on me.

761
00:58:59,434 --> 00:59:00,230
Are you blind?

762
00:59:43,278 --> 00:59:47,408
If people come to know my wife
has run away from home,

763
00:59:47,582 --> 00:59:48,378
I'll lose my honour,

764
00:59:48,550 --> 00:59:54,011
I must hear only her news of death.
Kill that bitch!

765
01:00:23,685 --> 01:00:24,777
Don't leave her!

766
01:00:31,126 --> 01:00:33,151
Catch her... catch her...

767
01:00:34,496 --> 01:00:37,488
Don't leave her!

768
01:01:54,777 --> 01:01:56,938
But I couldn't dare tell you
about my love.

769
01:01:58,013 --> 01:01:59,776
His name is Krishna Mohan.

770
01:02:00,749 --> 01:02:03,013
He's from Koilakuntla
from Kurnool district.

771
01:02:03,786 --> 01:02:07,950
I said about slapping a man
in a shopping mall.

772
01:02:08,924 --> 01:02:09,618
He was Krishna Mohan.

773
01:02:09,792 --> 01:02:11,123
I'll kill you.

774
01:02:12,027 --> 01:02:13,961
He didn't leave me after slapping him.

775
01:02:14,063 --> 01:02:16,122
He was after me like a mad man.

776
01:02:16,232 --> 01:02:19,133
I believed his sincerity
and started loving him.

777
01:02:23,439 --> 01:02:26,431
I wanted to tell you about this
when you fixed the marriage.

778
01:02:27,776 --> 01:02:31,644
Family will be get disturbed,
he said let's tell them after marriage,

779
01:02:32,014 --> 01:02:34,005
I couldn't say no to him,

780
01:02:34,183 --> 01:02:36,708
we went to his home after marriage,

781
01:02:36,886 --> 01:02:39,377
do you know how his home is?

782
01:02:40,155 --> 01:02:42,817
I told you about a big
palatial bungalow.

783
01:02:54,470 --> 01:02:57,371
When I say, just listen never argue.

784
01:02:57,706 --> 01:03:01,198
I'm strict and stand by word.

785
01:03:01,377 --> 01:03:06,974
If you listen to me, you'll be alive,
if not you'll die.

786
01:03:07,149 --> 01:03:09,481
That's the style of Muthyam.

787
01:03:18,093 --> 01:03:19,856
Come dear... come.

788
01:03:21,397 --> 01:03:23,194
Come son... come.

789
01:03:23,933 --> 01:03:28,029
She's cute!
I fear I may cast evil eye on her.

790
01:03:28,237 --> 01:03:29,499
Mother!

791
01:03:34,710 --> 01:03:37,804
Look, your grandson is here
with his wife.

792
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:42,212
She's shining and beautiful
like a fresh note.

793
01:03:42,952 --> 01:03:45,216
What are you looking at?

794
01:03:45,387 --> 01:03:48,220
Take blessings of your father-in-law.

795
01:03:56,198 --> 01:04:00,794
You slapped my son and
falling at my feet now.

796
01:04:00,970 --> 01:04:05,907
I lost my respect in
this entire district.

797
01:04:07,176 --> 01:04:09,235
Bring him.

798
01:04:11,981 --> 01:04:16,111
Will you draw pictures
and write stories? Tell her... tell her!

799
01:04:16,285 --> 01:04:18,412
I'm innocent, I wrote at the
behest of Munisamy.

800
01:04:18,754 --> 01:04:19,413
Please leave me sir.

801
01:04:19,755 --> 01:04:25,421
Let it be anyone who cares.
Read it! Read! Read it I say!

802
01:04:25,794 --> 01:04:29,821
A lady's slap on son's cheek is
a slap of slipper on Muthyam's honour!

803
01:04:29,999 --> 01:04:31,933
That's it... that's it!

804
01:04:32,868 --> 01:04:36,368
You slapped my son there
but my honour got

805
01:04:36,369 --> 01:04:39,868
maligned all over the
place here with posters.

806
01:04:42,378 --> 01:04:45,279
Please leave me sir...
I beg you sir.

807
01:04:53,389 --> 01:04:54,583
Stop it!

808
01:04:55,858 --> 01:04:57,792
I would've hacked you also.

809
01:04:57,960 --> 01:04:59,825
But my son!

810
01:04:59,995 --> 01:05:01,292
No father,

811
01:05:02,264 --> 01:05:05,791
I'll marry and bring her as
daughter-in-law to this house,

812
01:05:06,101 --> 01:05:09,195
the hands that slapped me I'll make
them wipe our slippers here.

813
01:05:09,371 --> 01:05:12,272
The mouth that spat at us,
I'll make her eat our leftovers.

814
01:05:12,441 --> 01:05:15,069
I'll make her a laughing
stock to all here.

815
01:05:15,244 --> 01:05:18,805
I'll make her cry her heart out.
Don't kill her!

816
01:05:19,815 --> 01:05:21,248
So he said.

817
01:05:21,950 --> 01:05:27,547
That's why you're still alive.
Go!

818
01:05:35,030 --> 01:05:36,998
What's this Krishna?

819
01:05:37,166 --> 01:05:39,498
Why are you watching silently
whatever your father is saying?

820
01:05:40,969 --> 01:05:42,903
There's still lot more to been seen.

821
01:05:43,405 --> 01:05:46,499
A small tit for tat for the slap.

822
01:05:57,653 --> 01:06:01,350
Tell them I'm your daughter-in-law.

823
01:06:07,362 --> 01:06:12,197
I got cheated,
I tried many times to contact you.

824
01:06:12,367 --> 01:06:13,459
But couldn't.

825
01:06:14,136 --> 01:06:16,366
Can't sit or stand without
their permission.

826
01:06:16,872 --> 01:06:20,205
I need their permission
to cry or die also.

827
01:06:23,011 --> 01:06:30,011
I had enjoyed a family's love till now
but there's no one to talk top me also,

828
01:06:31,053 --> 01:06:33,385
I was struggling alone there, brother.

829
01:06:50,439 --> 01:06:54,068
You covered up all my mistakes,

830
01:06:55,010 --> 01:07:01,677
please cover up this one last mistake
and take me home, brother.

831
01:07:29,578 --> 01:07:32,741
Found them?
- No sir!

832
01:07:33,482 --> 01:07:38,044
People running away fearing life
are half dead.

833
01:07:38,220 --> 01:07:40,313
We'll not kill those who are
already half dead,

834
01:07:40,489 --> 01:07:43,754
come and fall at my feet,
I'll forgive and spare your life.

835
01:07:48,664 --> 01:07:51,497
Throw them out in which ever
home they may be.

836
01:07:51,667 --> 01:07:55,364
If not I'll kill wipe
out entire village.

837
01:07:55,537 --> 01:07:57,732
Everyone one of will be
reduced to ashes.

838
01:08:03,412 --> 01:08:05,141
Your threat has worked.

839
01:08:05,314 --> 01:08:08,511
Sir, please forgive us... leave us, sir.
- I'll spare you.

840
01:08:08,684 --> 01:08:13,348
What will I get? I'll get good name
for keeping the word.

841
01:08:13,522 --> 01:08:18,118
If people take this as advantage
and kick me and seek forgiveness,

842
01:08:18,293 --> 01:08:19,453
what will be my position then?

843
01:08:19,628 --> 01:08:24,497
So breaking promise is better
than killing a man.

844
01:08:24,666 --> 01:08:28,158
Get the fourth man also!
- Sir, he's escaping.

845
01:08:30,105 --> 01:08:35,338
Go... go...
- No sir... no sir...

846
01:09:05,374 --> 01:09:08,502
At least I got my sons' ashes,

847
01:09:08,744 --> 01:09:11,406
their ashes shouldn't also remain,

848
01:09:11,580 --> 01:09:12,544
not even ashes should remain!

849
01:09:26,995 --> 01:09:29,555
Stop it! Only three died!

850
01:09:29,698 --> 01:09:33,031
Why fourth? To kill you and take bath?
Remove it.

851
01:09:33,535 --> 01:09:36,163
What's this son a
sacrificial pot remains?

852
01:09:37,339 --> 01:09:41,139
I foresee it as bad omen.
I don't see any good omen.

853
01:09:41,309 --> 01:09:44,210
What are you saying?
- What else you want to happen?

854
01:09:44,546 --> 01:09:48,539
Sacrifice pot remains,
daughter-in-law managed to escape,

855
01:09:48,717 --> 01:09:51,550
aren't these bring bad name
and death to us?

856
01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:54,883
Daughter-in-law escaped?
Call Krishna Mohan.

857
01:09:55,057 --> 01:09:58,288
Where did your wife go?

858
01:09:58,827 --> 01:10:00,294
No use in bowing head in shame,

859
01:10:00,629 --> 01:10:02,221
where am I to hide my head now?

860
01:10:02,564 --> 01:10:07,365
Do one thing, kill me and
use the fourth pot to take bath.

861
01:10:30,592 --> 01:10:34,358
Though so many are guarding here,
you managed to escape,

862
01:10:34,696 --> 01:10:39,292
it means somebody is helping you.
Tell me, who is it?

863
01:10:39,634 --> 01:10:41,602
Who is it? Tell me!

864
01:10:44,806 --> 01:10:46,103
Tell me!

865
01:10:46,842 --> 01:10:48,867
Nobody helped me, I went on my own.

866
01:10:49,044 --> 01:10:50,409
I'll kill you.
- Wait sir.

867
01:10:51,213 --> 01:10:54,205
People wet their pants in this district
on the mention of your name.- Yes.

868
01:10:54,382 --> 01:10:57,408
How can you kill her?
- What are you saying?

869
01:10:57,753 --> 01:10:59,948
Yes sir, you're epitome of manliness,

870
01:11:00,122 --> 01:11:02,818
people would spit on you
for killing a helpless woman,

871
01:11:02,991 --> 01:11:05,118
will you dishonour yourself?

872
01:11:08,663 --> 01:11:09,789
You are right!

873
01:11:10,766 --> 01:11:14,395
His word saved you, go.
Go inside.

874
01:11:15,237 --> 01:11:16,295
Bye sir.

875
01:11:16,638 --> 01:11:17,434
Stop!

876
01:11:20,642 --> 01:11:23,406
You saved my honour, what do you want?

877
01:11:23,745 --> 01:11:27,647
Money? House? Land?
- Munisamy's head!

878
01:11:28,350 --> 01:11:32,810
What?
- Munisamy's head!

879
01:11:33,388 --> 01:11:35,982
Munisamy's head?
- Why do you want his head?

880
01:11:36,158 --> 01:11:39,218
Revenge! He killed my grandfather,

881
01:11:39,394 --> 01:11:42,329
I must knock his head and
place it on my grandpa's tomb.

882
01:11:42,664 --> 01:11:45,428
Excellent! I got a good support,

883
01:11:45,767 --> 01:11:49,225
if you're with me, you are much
better than these useless people.

884
01:11:49,404 --> 01:11:53,431
Without stepping out,
without dishonouring my reputation,

885
01:11:53,775 --> 01:11:54,673
you must take care of it.

886
01:11:54,843 --> 01:12:00,281
All of you listen,
he's my right hand from now.

887
01:12:06,254 --> 01:12:09,223
My name is Swathimuthyam,
my mother was Kamalahassan's great fan.

888
01:12:09,391 --> 01:12:12,451
I was born on the day 'Swathimuthyam'
was released, so that name.

889
01:12:12,794 --> 01:12:16,457
Though I'm named as Swathimuthyam,
I'm very tough.

890
01:12:16,798 --> 01:12:20,256
If he's right hand here,
am I left hand then?

891
01:12:20,435 --> 01:12:24,371
Before you give me a shock,
I'll give you a thunderbolt.

892
01:12:24,706 --> 01:12:26,196
Finished!

893
01:12:31,313 --> 01:12:36,376
His father is better, no reaction
for all this, giving poses.

894
01:12:41,756 --> 01:12:44,088
The shed you are going to stay.

895
01:12:44,259 --> 01:12:47,387
Stop! Why did you come here?
- For you only.

896
01:12:47,729 --> 01:12:50,254
Making fun of me?
You said about Munisamy's head.

897
01:12:50,432 --> 01:12:52,764
That was a lie, this is truth.
- Why did you come for me?

898
01:12:52,934 --> 01:12:56,734
Though working and toiling for years,
remains just a servant,

899
01:12:56,905 --> 01:12:58,896
change must come... must come.

900
01:12:59,074 --> 01:13:01,542
You must become Estate's manager
and I must be your assistant.

901
01:13:01,877 --> 01:13:02,901
How can we become?

902
01:13:04,045 --> 01:13:07,481
It seems there's a Munisamy's mole here,

903
01:13:07,816 --> 01:13:10,284
if you find that mole,
you'll get promoted.

904
01:13:10,452 --> 01:13:11,919
Who is he?

905
01:13:12,153 --> 01:13:15,145
I don't know the name
but I've his phone number.

906
01:13:15,323 --> 01:13:16,347
Tell me the number.

907
01:13:16,524 --> 01:13:19,516
It's a strange...fancy number.

908
01:13:19,861 --> 01:13:23,092
Fancier number than mine?
- What's your number?

909
01:13:23,265 --> 01:13:27,759
9032032863

910
01:13:27,936 --> 01:13:32,430
I got it! 903203
- Stop...stop...

911
01:13:32,774 --> 01:13:36,972
2863!

912
01:13:37,145 --> 01:13:39,272
I'll catch him with this number.

913
01:13:39,447 --> 01:13:41,972
My assistant post?
- Come and join tomorrow.

914
01:13:42,150 --> 01:13:44,118
Confirmed?
- Confirmed.

915
01:13:48,256 --> 01:13:51,589
Haritha, eat dear.

916
01:13:52,294 --> 01:13:53,886
Did you see them, brother?

917
01:13:54,362 --> 01:13:58,321
They are not humans,
it's impossible to achieve your aim.

918
01:13:58,500 --> 01:14:01,992
Can't avoid it,
there's no other choice too,

919
01:14:02,170 --> 01:14:04,536
play the game as per
the situation and time,

920
01:14:04,873 --> 01:14:08,001
father thinks you would've definitely
switched the wrong button,

921
01:14:08,176 --> 01:14:11,543
I must reform brother-in-law and
take you to father with honour.

922
01:14:11,813 --> 01:14:17,149
Let's go all three of us from here
or else let's die here.

923
01:14:17,552 --> 01:14:21,613
Aren't you angry on me for doing this?

924
01:14:22,857 --> 01:14:24,620
Don't you feel like hating me?

925
01:14:24,859 --> 01:14:30,559
No dear, if I see tears in your eyes,
I'll lose my balance.

926
01:14:31,166 --> 01:14:32,224
No.

927
01:14:34,269 --> 01:14:39,104
Okay, I'll endure anything in the
confidence that you're with me.

928
01:14:40,175 --> 01:14:41,164
Eat dear!

929
01:14:51,186 --> 01:14:53,051
What's that?
- Plate.

930
01:14:53,221 --> 01:14:56,190
Plate? I thought it's a winnow.

931
01:14:56,358 --> 01:15:01,921
What's this drama?
For whom you are here?

932
01:15:02,097 --> 01:15:04,657
I told you it's for Munisamy's head.

933
01:15:05,867 --> 01:15:09,268
Fool him, you can't fool me.

934
01:15:09,571 --> 01:15:13,098
You brought back the run away girl
and got into his good books,

935
01:15:13,274 --> 01:15:16,573
you're starving and
gave your food to her,

936
01:15:16,911 --> 01:15:22,543
both scenes are not in sync,
there's something, I must know it.

937
01:15:22,884 --> 01:15:24,408
Tell me, who is that girl?

938
01:15:24,586 --> 01:15:28,545
Waste to hide it anymore with you,
she's my sister,

939
01:15:28,923 --> 01:15:30,356
he got cheated and got stuck here,

940
01:15:30,525 --> 01:15:32,049
I don't have anything to do
with anyone here,

941
01:15:32,227 --> 01:15:34,286
I must reform my brother-in-law
and make them live happily.

942
01:15:34,462 --> 01:15:37,659
Will you reform him?
Have you gone mad?

943
01:15:37,999 --> 01:15:39,557
Do you know about this family?

944
01:15:39,901 --> 01:15:42,096
If he comes to know about you,
he'll kill you both.

945
01:15:42,270 --> 01:15:47,469
Uncle, though sins stand tall and large,
it's foundations are very weak,

946
01:15:47,642 --> 01:15:50,577
some day it'll come down,
they too will!

947
01:15:50,912 --> 01:15:52,903
You're really mad!

948
01:15:53,081 --> 01:15:55,447
They'll kill the moment
they know about you.

949
01:15:55,617 --> 01:15:58,211
I'll not let them know it.
- But I know it, right?

950
01:15:58,386 --> 01:16:01,617
You know the matter, yet discussing
with me here instead of there,

951
01:16:01,956 --> 01:16:04,015
so you're like Vibhishana of Ramayana.
You'll not tell them.

952
01:16:04,192 --> 01:16:06,592
Don't trust me so much.

953
01:16:06,928 --> 01:16:09,089
Okay uncle, what's aunt doing?

954
01:16:09,264 --> 01:16:11,391
Aunt? I'm not married yet.

955
01:16:11,566 --> 01:16:13,090
Are you a bachelor still?

956
01:16:13,268 --> 01:16:15,236
How can you understand
family sentiments then?

957
01:16:15,403 --> 01:16:18,600
You're taking too much of liberty,
I'm warning you,

958
01:16:18,940 --> 01:16:22,603
I mustn't see you here tomorrow,
try to understand me.

959
01:16:22,944 --> 01:16:24,275
No uncle...

960
01:16:42,497 --> 01:16:46,126
What's the matter, uncle?
- Are you still here?

961
01:16:46,501 --> 01:16:50,301
No smart acts here, your body will
replace the punch bag.

962
01:16:50,472 --> 01:16:51,962
Is he so tough?

963
01:16:52,140 --> 01:16:55,667
Though you helped them,
he didn't even look at you,

964
01:16:56,010 --> 01:16:57,773
try to judge his character from it.

965
01:16:59,547 --> 01:17:01,344
Shattering sir!

966
01:17:01,516 --> 01:17:05,509
It cracked! Had it been a man?
He would've thrown up a litre of blood.

967
01:17:05,687 --> 01:17:08,155
Stop that praise, this is kids play.

968
01:17:08,356 --> 01:17:11,189
I thought it was a competition.
- He's finished.

969
01:17:11,359 --> 01:17:13,054
I think he'll bleed now.

970
01:17:13,228 --> 01:17:14,786
Hey you stop there!

971
01:17:15,130 --> 01:17:17,428
Is it kids play to you?
Shall we fight?

972
01:17:17,599 --> 01:17:18,998
Do you've courage? Come on!

973
01:17:19,167 --> 01:17:20,657
I don't know the rules of the game,

974
01:17:21,002 --> 01:17:25,405
mustn't fall for punches and
once fallen mustn't get up.- Is it?

975
01:17:25,573 --> 01:17:29,509
Keep a pot of water ready.
- It's ready sir.

976
01:17:30,678 --> 01:17:32,669
You talked about reforming him
but picking up fight now.

977
01:17:33,014 --> 01:17:36,814
Just checking him, uncle.
The story starts now. Keep watching.

978
01:18:14,055 --> 01:18:15,215
Come on!

979
01:18:34,075 --> 01:18:38,409
If he dies, conduct his funeral
grandly from my account.

980
01:18:38,646 --> 01:18:43,242
If he regains tell him never
to come face me again.

981
01:18:46,621 --> 01:18:48,589
Why did you give up the
winning opportunity?

982
01:18:49,390 --> 01:18:51,824
I left him seeing my
sister's face, uncle.

983
01:18:52,894 --> 01:18:55,829
I must lose today to win tomorrow.

984
01:19:21,856 --> 01:19:25,690
What a punch! Knock-out punch!
My chins are broken!

985
01:19:25,860 --> 01:19:29,523
I'm reeling! I'm knocked-out!

986
01:19:29,697 --> 01:19:33,463
Oh God! What a punch
What a great body!

987
01:19:33,634 --> 01:19:37,434
Hit like iron and stars appeared
before eyes in day time...

988
01:19:37,605 --> 01:19:41,006
I don't mind getting beaten
by junior boss...

989
01:19:41,342 --> 01:19:44,675
It's the hands that feeds,
let it beat me...

990
01:19:44,846 --> 01:19:48,407
Boss, I bow to you!

991
01:19:48,583 --> 01:19:52,849
People around here fear you,
please accept our respects...

992
01:20:30,591 --> 01:20:34,049
Look at him! This is the lion
that rules the Rayalaseema...

993
01:20:34,395 --> 01:20:37,956
He's just an infant with moustache...

994
01:20:38,132 --> 01:20:41,659
You're the mightiest and
most fearsome man here...

995
01:20:41,836 --> 01:20:45,567
There's no man who can
dare go against you...

996
01:20:45,807 --> 01:20:49,436
Did you see his son?
He can scare the thunders...

997
01:20:49,610 --> 01:20:53,068
His anger is Tsunami of fire...

998
01:20:53,414 --> 01:20:55,041
Though you eat salt and
chilly proportionately...

999
01:20:55,216 --> 01:20:57,081
In pride and arrogance,
you're incomparable...

1000
01:20:57,418 --> 01:21:00,979
All around this place it's your
name that calls the shots...

1001
01:21:01,155 --> 01:21:04,955
I must learn the good
and bad from you...

1002
01:21:05,126 --> 01:21:08,960
May Lord Venkateswara shower
his grace on you!

1003
01:21:54,509 --> 01:21:55,999
Eyes are sharp like knives...

1004
01:21:56,177 --> 01:21:57,974
Heart is like firing guns...

1005
01:21:58,146 --> 01:22:01,809
If boss opens mouth,
it's a bomb blast...

1006
01:22:01,983 --> 01:22:04,577
You've a mass of support,
what a luxurious life...

1007
01:22:05,753 --> 01:22:09,484
Entire village bows
to you like God...

1008
01:22:09,690 --> 01:22:13,182
She's a mother who cares but
Goddess kali if anything goes wrong...

1009
01:22:13,528 --> 01:22:16,964
Mother of boss is the
foundation to this home...

1010
01:22:17,131 --> 01:22:20,794
Your clan is great and
spotless clean...

1011
01:22:20,968 --> 01:22:24,995
What do we lack in life
under your grace?

1012
01:23:01,909 --> 01:23:02,933
Oh my God!

1013
01:23:03,778 --> 01:23:06,406
Boss' niece.

1014
01:23:06,581 --> 01:23:10,711
Her father died, he's raising
and taking care of her.

1015
01:23:11,452 --> 01:23:13,477
How are you dear?
- I'm fine uncle.

1016
01:23:13,654 --> 01:23:16,885
Get her bags. You come.

1017
01:23:24,632 --> 01:23:28,466
You said you'll not till I've died,
why did you come now?

1018
01:23:28,636 --> 01:23:32,402
You're not dying,
so I'm here to kill you.

1019
01:23:33,608 --> 01:23:35,599
I can't fight with
this treacherous lady.

1020
01:23:35,776 --> 01:23:39,405
The bitch may push me
into some dried well.

1021
01:23:46,454 --> 01:23:48,979
What had happened was...
- I know everything.

1022
01:23:49,323 --> 01:23:52,258
Your uncle told me everything
for a biryani.

1023
01:23:52,426 --> 01:23:54,917
Isn't your problem mine?

1024
01:23:55,262 --> 01:23:58,754
I'll be here with you till your
sister's problem is solved.

1025
01:24:06,807 --> 01:24:10,038
I've been trying may times but
always getting engaged tone.

1026
01:24:10,378 --> 01:24:11,606
May be he's trying for your number?

1027
01:24:11,779 --> 01:24:13,804
Why would he be trying for me?
Don't talk like a fool.

1028
01:24:13,981 --> 01:24:15,778
You're trying top reach him, right?

1029
01:24:16,550 --> 01:24:18,279
How about doing like this?
- What's it?

1030
01:24:18,452 --> 01:24:19,783
Send a message to him.

1031
01:24:29,797 --> 01:24:31,992
I think he's a crook.

1032
01:24:32,333 --> 01:24:34,767
I sent how are you and he has
sent back the same message.

1033
01:24:34,935 --> 01:24:38,029
Brother, he's with full plan.

1034
01:24:38,372 --> 01:24:40,397
Don't spare him, find him.
Be on that job.

1035
01:24:40,574 --> 01:24:43,304
Are you leaving?
- I'll be back in a minute.

1036
01:24:50,051 --> 01:24:53,817
I must get the contract,
I don't mind the price.

1037
01:24:54,689 --> 01:24:55,815
Got it?

1038
01:24:59,427 --> 01:25:02,692
Brother-in-law is going out on important
work, go before him as good omen.

1039
01:25:02,863 --> 01:25:03,625
No brother.

1040
01:25:03,698 --> 01:25:05,196
If you come before him,
he'll get the contract,

1041
01:25:05,197 --> 01:25:06,386
sentiment will work in your favour.

1042
01:25:06,387 --> 01:25:07,955
No brother... no...
- Please listen to me... come.

1043
01:25:08,335 --> 01:25:09,063
Go!

1044
01:25:09,370 --> 01:25:11,702
I'm telling you, go.
Go dear.

1045
01:25:19,714 --> 01:25:22,114
Why are you coming before me
like a devil when I'm going out?

1046
01:25:22,450 --> 01:25:23,417
Go away!

1047
01:25:24,351 --> 01:25:25,682
Bloody devil!

1048
01:25:26,587 --> 01:25:28,452
Uncle come.
- Coming.

1049
01:25:28,622 --> 01:25:31,022
Don't worry, come.
- Uncle I said come.

1050
01:25:31,358 --> 01:25:33,690
Get lost if you don't want to come.
- You come... I'm coming.

1051
01:25:33,861 --> 01:25:34,691
I'm coming.

1052
01:25:52,880 --> 01:25:53,869
Go fast!

1053
01:25:57,785 --> 01:26:00,879
I'm on the way,
I'll be there in 30 minutes.

1054
01:26:01,989 --> 01:26:03,718
Go fast!

1055
01:26:04,091 --> 01:26:05,183
Give me the file.

1056
01:26:38,025 --> 01:26:42,587
He must die just like my sons died.

1057
01:26:42,763 --> 01:26:48,759
Kill me if you've guts.
- Throw... throw!

1058
01:26:56,610 --> 01:26:58,237
Burn that bastard!

1059
01:27:02,817 --> 01:27:04,444
Shut up you bloody bastard!

1060
01:27:10,958 --> 01:27:13,256
Come... come...

1061
01:27:32,112 --> 01:27:35,980
Go... go... go...

1062
01:27:36,150 --> 01:27:38,277
Hit him... hit... hit him...

1063
01:28:44,251 --> 01:28:45,878
The contract is yours.

1064
01:28:47,254 --> 01:28:49,784
You're really brave,
if you hadn't come in between,

1065
01:28:49,957 --> 01:28:51,224
all of us would be dead by now.

1066
01:28:51,292 --> 01:28:52,657
I didn't do anything uncle,

1067
01:28:52,826 --> 01:28:56,023
it's grace of the face of
good omen while leaving home.

1068
01:28:56,196 --> 01:28:56,787
Well said!

1069
01:28:56,964 --> 01:29:00,058
Whom did I face while leaving home?
- Who else your wife sir?

1070
01:29:00,567 --> 01:29:03,035
Today she's finished.
You're right.

1071
01:29:03,203 --> 01:29:05,569
This happened because
she came before me.

1072
01:29:05,739 --> 01:29:08,105
You're mistaken sir.
- What?

1073
01:29:08,275 --> 01:29:11,073
Yes sir, no wife would wish
her husband's death,

1074
01:29:11,245 --> 01:29:13,873
you saw her face,
so you got the contract,

1075
01:29:14,048 --> 01:29:15,037
and escaped from death too.

1076
01:29:15,215 --> 01:29:16,182
I can't understand him.

1077
01:29:16,350 --> 01:29:19,751
You escaped from this danger
because of that angel's grace.

1078
01:29:21,088 --> 01:29:23,648
Get down. Get down I say!

1079
01:29:23,991 --> 01:29:24,923
What's my mistake, sir?

1080
01:29:25,092 --> 01:29:27,390
Talking about her is mistake.
Get down.

1081
01:29:27,728 --> 01:29:29,753
It's sin to talk about good things here.

1082
01:29:30,764 --> 01:29:34,723
Sir, I won't get bus also here,
I've to walk 25 kms.

1083
01:29:34,902 --> 01:29:36,597
Please stop sir...

1084
01:29:39,340 --> 01:29:41,137
Poor man has to walk now.

1085
01:29:41,308 --> 01:29:44,402
You're wrong, he blabbered,
do you've to punish him for that?

1086
01:29:44,745 --> 01:29:47,407
He has to walk 25 kms alone.

1087
01:29:49,149 --> 01:29:53,984
He dumped me like a paddy bag.
Useless guy!

1088
01:29:54,154 --> 01:29:55,781
You too uncle!

1089
01:29:55,956 --> 01:29:57,287
All your grace.

1090
01:29:57,624 --> 01:29:59,387
He showed the affection
he has for you on me.

1091
01:29:59,727 --> 01:30:01,126
Come, let's walk.

1092
01:30:08,802 --> 01:30:11,430
You saw her face,
so you got the contract,

1093
01:30:11,772 --> 01:30:12,898
and escape from death too.

1094
01:30:13,073 --> 01:30:16,804
You escaped from this danger
because of that angel's grace.

1095
01:30:22,783 --> 01:30:26,651
My legs are paining with the long walk.

1096
01:30:30,190 --> 01:30:32,658
You had to see your
brother's face then...

1097
01:30:37,965 --> 01:30:43,164
Seeing her face we forgot
the tiredness, right?

1098
01:30:43,804 --> 01:30:45,328
Can't you tell this to Muthyam?

1099
01:30:45,672 --> 01:30:48,334
You're hell bent on killing me.

1100
01:30:53,180 --> 01:30:58,812
Flowers in hair, henna on palms.
What's this?

1101
01:30:58,986 --> 01:31:02,854
Today you're dead!

1102
01:31:10,230 --> 01:31:12,198
The old woman is dead today.

1103
01:31:15,702 --> 01:31:17,693
Are you doing make up?

1104
01:31:17,871 --> 01:31:20,339
Hey old girl!
Why are you carrying that vase?

1105
01:31:20,507 --> 01:31:21,997
Why are you rushing on us?

1106
01:31:22,176 --> 01:31:28,206
Doctor advised to lift weight
to keep fit.

1107
01:31:29,450 --> 01:31:32,510
Will you kill even a old woman?

1108
01:31:33,153 --> 01:31:38,921
I'll consider this as house
and humans till my sister is safe,

1109
01:31:39,093 --> 01:31:43,826
if anything happens to her,
I'll not consider anything,

1110
01:31:43,997 --> 01:31:48,900
if I start killing, no one will be
alive to mourn the dead.

1111
01:31:57,411 --> 01:31:58,105
What happened sir?

1112
01:31:58,278 --> 01:32:02,738
What happened to the ring at the
feet of God in the western room?

1113
01:32:02,916 --> 01:32:05,407
Find which bastard has stolen it.

1114
01:32:07,955 --> 01:32:11,083
Till now no theft ever happened
in this house,

1115
01:32:11,258 --> 01:32:13,226
I'm sure it must be the
handiwork of a new recruit.

1116
01:32:13,393 --> 01:32:16,123
What's that indirect reference
towards him?

1117
01:32:16,296 --> 01:32:19,788
Who is he? My right hand.
He'll never do such mistakes.

1118
01:32:19,967 --> 01:32:25,564
Wait sir, I'm a suspect,
I must prove my innocence now.

1119
01:32:27,774 --> 01:32:29,435
Wait.
- Stop.

1120
01:32:31,178 --> 01:32:32,202
Check now sir.

1121
01:32:32,379 --> 01:32:34,779
What's that? Show me.

1122
01:32:35,782 --> 01:32:36,441
Show it to me.

1123
01:32:36,783 --> 01:32:38,774
I'll not show even if you kill me.

1124
01:32:43,190 --> 01:32:45,454
I'll kill you! Show me.

1125
01:32:46,326 --> 01:32:47,384
Show it.

1126
01:32:48,929 --> 01:32:50,226
Show it I say!

1127
01:32:50,397 --> 01:32:51,955
Show it I say!

1128
01:32:54,468 --> 01:32:57,301
What's it? What's it?

1129
01:32:58,172 --> 01:32:59,161
You!

1130
01:32:59,339 --> 01:33:01,307
I'm asking you what's it?

1131
01:33:04,178 --> 01:33:05,304
My God!

1132
01:33:15,389 --> 01:33:21,589
So many are here! Useless!

1133
01:33:21,929 --> 01:33:25,888
You drink barrels of wine and
eat dozens of chicken,

1134
01:33:26,066 --> 01:33:27,158
why?

1135
01:33:27,334 --> 01:33:29,325
Look at this! Look at this!

1136
01:33:31,538 --> 01:33:34,507
Body is Sai Baba's and head is mine.

1137
01:33:34,841 --> 01:33:41,178
He reveres me like God.
That is loyalty. Bloody dogs!

1138
01:33:41,548 --> 01:33:43,448
Why are you so sad?

1139
01:33:44,384 --> 01:33:47,945
I'm not sad sir but one thing
is worrying me.

1140
01:33:48,121 --> 01:33:49,850
Is it calling you a thief?

1141
01:33:50,557 --> 01:33:57,486
No sir, I pray you like God but you
were made to come out, that's why.

1142
01:33:57,664 --> 01:34:01,361
Sir, the ring was found under the table.

1143
01:34:03,570 --> 01:34:08,337
From today if I'm God,
you're the priest.

1144
01:34:08,508 --> 01:34:11,409
Your word is my word.
All of you listen carefully!

1145
01:34:11,578 --> 01:34:16,208
From today his word is my word,
got it?

1146
01:34:18,518 --> 01:34:20,918
Human relations are deteriorating.

1147
01:34:21,088 --> 01:34:24,546
I called you uncle,
don't you've any feelings?

1148
01:34:24,891 --> 01:34:27,451
Will you keep the ring in my bag?
Age old trick.

1149
01:34:27,628 --> 01:34:30,347
I feared you may get
caught and die, if I

1150
01:34:30,348 --> 01:34:33,066
send you out, you'll
at least be alive.

1151
01:34:33,267 --> 01:34:35,064
That's why I kept the ring under table.

1152
01:34:35,235 --> 01:34:38,136
If not I would've kept it
in your pocket.

1153
01:34:38,305 --> 01:34:39,704
You'd be dead by now.

1154
01:34:40,040 --> 01:34:43,976
I've a doubt, how did you guess
that I kept the ring in your bag?

1155
01:34:44,144 --> 01:34:46,408
I've a good network here, uncle.

1156
01:34:47,914 --> 01:34:48,710
Who is it?

1157
01:34:50,150 --> 01:34:52,209
She came here yesterday only,
how did you manage to trap her?

1158
01:34:52,386 --> 01:34:53,978
How are you both connected?

1159
01:35:08,469 --> 01:35:10,437
You've grown it very well.

1160
01:35:17,712 --> 01:35:20,146
Well done younger son!

1161
01:35:20,315 --> 01:35:24,308
You killed the last remaining enemy
and fulfilled your father's wish.

1162
01:35:24,519 --> 01:35:25,918
Good show! Excellent!

1163
01:35:35,129 --> 01:35:38,121
May all the evil eyes cast on you
be warded off.

1164
01:35:38,466 --> 01:35:39,490
Come.

1165
01:35:45,406 --> 01:35:48,603
Who is he uncle?
- Your real test starts now.

1166
01:35:48,776 --> 01:35:55,776
He's a mix of demon gargantuan,
a womanizer, and a terrorist.

1167
01:36:00,855 --> 01:36:04,484
If you do anything in haste,
he'll take bath for you.

1168
01:36:19,674 --> 01:36:22,268
Why are you eating like that?

1169
01:36:22,510 --> 01:36:26,844
Food, drink or woman,
I'll like to eat fully.

1170
01:36:27,682 --> 01:36:28,740
Why are you getting up? Eat.

1171
01:36:28,916 --> 01:36:31,248
I'm no more hungry, aunty.

1172
01:36:31,419 --> 01:36:37,358
Feeling shy?
Wish I had been your aunt's son.

1173
01:36:37,525 --> 01:36:39,516
I'm your brother!

1174
01:36:41,296 --> 01:36:43,355
What's that nonsense? Eat!

1175
01:36:44,565 --> 01:36:48,399
How long you'll roam like a free bird?

1176
01:36:48,569 --> 01:36:49,866
Won't you marry and settle?

1177
01:36:50,204 --> 01:36:52,934
Hey oldie, I like to eat in a leaf
and throw it.

1178
01:36:53,274 --> 01:36:57,438
I don't like even if it's a silver plate
to wash and re-use it.

1179
01:36:57,612 --> 01:37:01,207
You're just like your grandpa!

1180
01:37:01,549 --> 01:37:02,538
So what?

1181
01:37:04,552 --> 01:37:05,382
Get up!

1182
01:37:05,787 --> 01:37:08,654
Who is he?
- New recruit, your father's right hand.

1183
01:37:08,823 --> 01:37:10,984
So what? Why are you standing calmly?

1184
01:37:11,359 --> 01:37:12,517
Don't you know you must bow to me?

1185
01:37:12,593 --> 01:37:13,821
Greetings brother.

1186
01:37:15,363 --> 01:37:17,923
Am I a school teacher?

1187
01:37:18,266 --> 01:37:21,929
You must fall at the feet
of man of the house.

1188
01:37:22,270 --> 01:37:24,397
What are you looking?
Come on do it.- Do it.

1189
01:37:28,910 --> 01:37:32,676
Teach him how servants must behave.

1190
01:37:32,847 --> 01:37:35,907
If we pass urine,
you must hold it in your hands.

1191
01:37:36,250 --> 01:37:41,381
If you say no, your head will roll down.
- No need, I'll tell him.

1192
01:37:41,556 --> 01:37:45,720
Didn't I tell you he's a scoundrel?
Got hurt seriously?

1193
01:37:45,960 --> 01:37:49,112
Let's discuss this
later, but please manage

1194
01:37:49,113 --> 01:37:52,263
to keep it secret from sister. Okay?

1195
01:38:04,379 --> 01:38:05,812
Always engaged.

1196
01:38:05,980 --> 01:38:08,047
I've been observing, you always
call a number, who is that fool?

1197
01:38:08,081 --> 01:38:11,513
The enemy is our home.
This is his phone number.

1198
01:38:11,686 --> 01:38:13,950
When ever I call him
it's always engaged.

1199
01:38:14,288 --> 01:38:16,620
Are you dialing phone number
or pin code number?

1200
01:38:16,791 --> 01:38:18,759
Please don't underestimate me.

1201
01:38:18,926 --> 01:38:21,861
I'm not a school drop out like you,
I'm fifth class failed.

1202
01:38:22,029 --> 01:38:26,966
Tell me the number.
- Number is 9032032863

1203
01:38:27,435 --> 01:38:29,596
Why are you beating me?
- Fool! That's your number.

1204
01:38:29,771 --> 01:38:31,500
My number?
- What if anyone else had called?

1205
01:38:31,672 --> 01:38:35,335
How dare he cheats me!
- I'll finish him today. - Who?

1206
01:38:35,510 --> 01:38:36,738
Docomo!
- Why?

1207
01:38:36,911 --> 01:38:38,970
Asking me why? How can they give
the same number to two people?

1208
01:38:39,313 --> 01:38:41,042
Am I looking so foolish?

1209
01:38:47,722 --> 01:38:49,747
Don't try to manage,
I've seen everything.

1210
01:38:49,924 --> 01:38:51,323
Did you?

1211
01:38:52,460 --> 01:38:53,688
You manage things very well.

1212
01:38:53,861 --> 01:38:56,022
I manage things very well
that's why I'm here.

1213
01:38:56,364 --> 01:38:59,856
You know one thing, I can mimic
everyone's voice.

1214
01:39:00,034 --> 01:39:01,126
Show me a sample.

1215
01:39:01,469 --> 01:39:02,868
This is how Muthyam speaks.

1216
01:39:03,037 --> 01:39:06,666
If you don't listen to me,
you'll die mid noon,

1217
01:39:06,841 --> 01:39:08,468
if you go against me, I'll kill you.

1218
01:39:08,643 --> 01:39:10,543
Excellent. One more please.

1219
01:39:10,711 --> 01:39:11,700
Shall I imitate the old woman?

1220
01:39:11,879 --> 01:39:14,473
Any man who can't pound betel leaf
and nut claims to be real man,

1221
01:39:14,649 --> 01:39:17,117
nobody works properly, my foot!
- Super!

1222
01:39:17,452 --> 01:39:20,012
If you mimic Narasimha,
I'll accept you're great!

1223
01:39:20,354 --> 01:39:23,016
Don't tell his name,
he's a scoundrel.

1224
01:39:23,357 --> 01:39:25,757
Do you know how he calls me?
Hey stinking pig!

1225
01:39:25,927 --> 01:39:28,054
I'm angry, please don't ask
to imitate his voice.

1226
01:39:28,396 --> 01:39:33,163
Manage anything,
but never imitate his voice.

1227
01:39:34,368 --> 01:39:35,426
Hey stinking pig!

1228
01:39:35,603 --> 01:39:39,369
I told you to imitate anything
but not his voice.

1229
01:39:39,540 --> 01:39:40,973
Hey stinking pig!

1230
01:39:44,078 --> 01:39:45,705
Hey stinking pig!

1231
01:39:51,519 --> 01:39:53,077
Do you know he was here?

1232
01:39:53,421 --> 01:39:55,446
He came before you talked about him.

1233
01:39:55,623 --> 01:39:57,386
Why didn't you warn me?

1234
01:39:57,692 --> 01:39:59,887
Wanted to see how you'll
manage the situation.

1235
01:40:00,528 --> 01:40:02,689
To know who I'll manage the situation?

1236
01:40:02,864 --> 01:40:06,061
My sweet boy!
I can't hear anything.

1237
01:40:06,400 --> 01:40:09,733
I can't see anything.
Please take me somewhere.

1238
01:40:13,908 --> 01:40:15,933
I'm dead!

1239
01:40:16,110 --> 01:40:20,570
What? Toil is mine and drink is yours.

1240
01:40:20,815 --> 01:40:24,478
I came home happily after
having a full bottle.

1241
01:40:24,652 --> 01:40:26,449
Taking bath with lux soap.

1242
01:40:26,621 --> 01:40:28,452
Which soap?
- Lux.

1243
01:40:28,623 --> 01:40:35,119
I thought you'll take bath and be ready
for me like Mumaith Khan with jasmine.

1244
01:40:35,463 --> 01:40:38,796
Will you sleep under a rug, you...

1245
01:40:38,966 --> 01:40:42,493
Ram? Who is this Ram Gopal Varma?

1246
01:40:42,670 --> 01:40:45,605
How long you've been having
affair with him?

1247
01:40:45,773 --> 01:40:48,970
Would he come to rescue you?
- Save me.

1248
01:40:49,143 --> 01:40:51,839
Call Ram! I'll write history in blood.

1249
01:40:52,013 --> 01:40:53,776
Bloody!
- Am I bloody?

1250
01:40:53,948 --> 01:40:57,941
If husband comes, serve him food
and entertain him on bed,

1251
01:40:58,119 --> 01:40:59,518
where is she?

1252
01:40:59,687 --> 01:41:05,023
Search our pockets, cry like hell,
torture us...

1253
01:41:05,192 --> 01:41:06,989
What's wrong with you?
You'll die a miserable death.

1254
01:41:07,161 --> 01:41:09,994
You'll get ruined. Bloody bastard!
Go away you drunkard!

1255
01:41:10,164 --> 01:41:11,631
Sir, please save me.
- What man?

1256
01:41:11,799 --> 01:41:15,963
He's pointing a finger at boss and
folding his tongue, why are you silent?

1257
01:41:16,470 --> 01:41:17,464
Get down and take him to task.

1258
01:41:17,505 --> 01:41:19,666
I can't deal such family issues.

1259
01:41:19,840 --> 01:41:23,469
You're great in dealing such matters.

1260
01:41:23,744 --> 01:41:30,744
Should women get sacrificed
for men's atrocities?

1261
01:41:33,020 --> 01:41:36,888
Who are you to beat my husband?

1262
01:41:37,058 --> 01:41:39,151
My husband will beat or kill me?
What bothers you?

1263
01:41:39,493 --> 01:41:41,021
Husband and wife have many
things between them.

1264
01:41:41,095 --> 01:41:43,557
Come dear, you'd be tired
beating me, have food.

1265
01:41:43,731 --> 01:41:46,495
I'll beat you after having food, right?
- Okay.- Come.

1266
01:41:46,667 --> 01:41:48,191
How nice husband you are!
- Did you listen to me?

1267
01:41:48,268 --> 01:41:50,598
She raised cries of help,
so I went to help her,

1268
01:41:50,771 --> 01:41:51,897
but why did she beat me?

1269
01:41:52,073 --> 01:41:53,765
Anyone getting beaten would
raise cries like that only.

1270
01:41:53,841 --> 01:41:54,933
Didn't you shout now?

1271
01:41:55,109 --> 01:41:57,600
Wife will bear husband's
abuses and thrashing,

1272
01:41:57,778 --> 01:42:01,179
but if anyone beats her husband,
no wife would watch it silently.

1273
01:42:01,515 --> 01:42:04,678
Any husband would understand
this if he looks into his wife's eyes.

1274
01:42:04,852 --> 01:42:05,910
How much she loves him!

1275
01:42:06,087 --> 01:42:10,183
Only who live with wives can understand
not those who marry and ditch.

1276
01:42:10,524 --> 01:42:14,688
I didn't mean you, sir.
He's seeing me angrily.

1277
01:42:27,173 --> 01:42:28,333
Brother!

1278
01:42:30,911 --> 01:42:32,344
What happened?

1279
01:42:32,679 --> 01:42:33,509
Calm down.

1280
01:42:34,648 --> 01:42:36,172
What happened?

1281
01:42:36,349 --> 01:42:38,510
What happened last night was...

1282
01:42:53,533 --> 01:42:55,364
Please listen to me.

1283
01:43:02,809 --> 01:43:04,936
Stop... stop...

1284
01:43:23,930 --> 01:43:25,898
What's this?
Sister-in-law is equal to mother.

1285
01:43:26,232 --> 01:43:28,632
When you're desiring her,
would you leave me?

1286
01:43:28,802 --> 01:43:32,568
Sister-in-law? My foot relationship!
Go!

1287
01:43:58,431 --> 01:44:01,764
Hey come... come I say!

1288
01:46:31,985 --> 01:46:33,418
You!

1289
01:46:55,575 --> 01:46:58,601
May Munisamy's wife become a widow!

1290
01:46:58,778 --> 01:47:00,109
Come let's go.
- We are coming madam.

1291
01:47:01,447 --> 01:47:04,575
It seems he crushed my grandson
like sugar cane.

1292
01:47:04,751 --> 01:47:08,251
Why are you sitting
here when your brother

1293
01:47:08,252 --> 01:47:11,751
is fighting for life in hospital?

1294
01:47:12,759 --> 01:47:13,885
Come let's go.

1295
01:47:14,060 --> 01:47:18,622
No need, bloody womanizer
if he's alive or dead is same.

1296
01:47:19,999 --> 01:47:20,693
Go!

1297
01:47:20,867 --> 01:47:22,630
Stinking pig!

1298
01:47:43,890 --> 01:47:46,723
He's fighting for life there,

1299
01:47:46,893 --> 01:47:50,556
should we have to do house
warming function of new home now?

1300
01:47:50,730 --> 01:47:52,220
Why?

1301
01:47:55,235 --> 01:47:56,964
Grandma fell down!

1302
01:47:57,136 --> 01:48:00,037
What happened?
You fell like a tree in heavy wind.

1303
01:48:00,206 --> 01:48:02,231
Call the doctor.

1304
01:48:03,009 --> 01:48:03,941
Open your mouth.

1305
01:48:06,713 --> 01:48:09,841
She's hurt seriously,
can't say anything till tomorrow.

1306
01:48:14,520 --> 01:48:21,520
Son, a bad spirit is taking
over this home.

1307
01:48:23,263 --> 01:48:25,959
I'm dying son.
I'm dying!

1308
01:48:26,132 --> 01:48:30,193
Take care of the home.
Take care of children, my son.

1309
01:48:30,236 --> 01:48:31,530
Nothing will happen to you, keep quiet.

1310
01:48:31,571 --> 01:48:32,965
Sir, getting late to
house warming function.

1311
01:48:33,039 --> 01:48:34,167
Priest, you carry on.

1312
01:48:34,340 --> 01:48:36,740
How can I conduct without a couple?

1313
01:48:36,909 --> 01:48:39,969
You don't go son, you don't go.

1314
01:48:40,146 --> 01:48:44,207
If you go who will give me water.
- You keep quiet.

1315
01:48:44,550 --> 01:48:47,246
Sir, it's not good to postpone
the house warming function.

1316
01:48:47,587 --> 01:48:49,919
If I go she's worried,
if I don't go, it's bad omen.

1317
01:48:50,089 --> 01:48:50,987
What am I to do now?

1318
01:48:51,157 --> 01:48:53,591
Life here and function there,
both are very important.

1319
01:48:53,760 --> 01:48:57,628
You must be here,
any couple can manage there.

1320
01:48:57,797 --> 01:49:02,325
Sir, your elder son with his wife...
- I'm seeing Lord Venkateswara.

1321
01:49:02,669 --> 01:49:04,296
Manage it somehow.

1322
01:49:41,674 --> 01:49:43,699
Isn't she like Goddess Mahalakshmi?

1323
01:49:44,344 --> 01:49:46,778
Uncle, I wish this moment
stand still forever.

1324
01:52:00,612 --> 01:52:07,612
Country chicken curry...
come tonight to feast...

1325
01:52:08,053 --> 01:52:11,489
If you're a man and
have flair to enjoy...

1326
01:52:11,657 --> 01:52:15,423
Come... come... come...

1327
01:52:15,594 --> 01:52:22,594
Country chicken curry...
I'll have a go at it...

1328
01:52:23,402 --> 01:52:27,338
The delicious smell and
appearance is mouth watering...

1329
01:53:08,580 --> 01:53:12,243
The delicacy is alluring,
feast on it...

1330
01:53:12,418 --> 01:53:16,149
Come fast...

1331
01:53:16,321 --> 01:53:20,382
Every delicious thing
here is all yours...

1332
01:53:23,662 --> 01:53:27,291
Have you prepared it deliciously
for the man you love?

1333
01:53:27,466 --> 01:53:30,833
Have you secretly enhanced
it with fragrances of youth?

1334
01:53:31,170 --> 01:53:34,765
Giving you tasty betel leaves...

1335
01:53:35,107 --> 01:53:42,107
Feeding you in mouth those
sweet and syrupy lips...

1336
01:53:42,614 --> 01:53:46,243
May God bless you with bliss!

1337
01:54:15,781 --> 01:54:19,273
I'm not hasty young thing...

1338
01:54:19,451 --> 01:54:23,148
Come quickly...

1339
01:54:23,322 --> 01:54:27,452
I'm ready to give anything you ask...

1340
01:54:30,762 --> 01:54:34,357
I'm not a man who will hesitate...

1341
01:54:34,533 --> 01:54:38,799
Give me little freedom
and I'll rock you...

1342
01:54:42,241 --> 01:54:49,241
No need to leave youth to fast...
no need to sulk in loneliness...

1343
01:54:49,681 --> 01:54:53,310
May you be blessed
with child at the earliest!

1344
01:55:51,344 --> 01:55:52,436
Sir!
- Where is your junior madam?

1345
01:55:52,612 --> 01:55:53,408
Junior madam?

1346
01:55:53,579 --> 01:55:55,444
That's my wife.
Daughter-in-law of this house.

1347
01:55:55,615 --> 01:55:56,809
I don't know sir.

1348
01:55:58,217 --> 01:56:00,014
Did you see, Suri?
- No brother.

1349
01:56:00,186 --> 01:56:01,744
Where did she go?

1350
01:56:02,622 --> 01:56:06,524
You're searching your wife like a
man losing his dog in festive crowd,

1351
01:56:07,026 --> 01:56:08,254
are you thinking of living with her?

1352
01:56:08,427 --> 01:56:14,525
What's wrong if I live with my wife?
- Shut up! Bloody stinking pig!

1353
01:56:14,700 --> 01:56:17,533
I wanted to kill her the day
she slapped you,

1354
01:56:17,703 --> 01:56:21,366
you said no father, I'll marry
and make her your servant,

1355
01:56:21,541 --> 01:56:25,739
where? You're after her like
an ant after sugar.

1356
01:56:26,078 --> 01:56:28,273
Do you want me to say yes to it?

1357
01:56:28,447 --> 01:56:32,577
I saw your interest in her
and sent my men to kill her.

1358
01:56:32,752 --> 01:56:35,448
Are you a father?

1359
01:56:35,621 --> 01:56:37,384
Who gave you the right to kill my wife?

1360
01:56:37,557 --> 01:56:39,718
Who will give me?
Honour of this family gave me.

1361
01:56:40,059 --> 01:56:45,827
She didn't slap your face,
but on the honour of this family.

1362
01:56:46,165 --> 01:56:49,430
When you go after saying my wife,

1363
01:56:49,602 --> 01:56:53,299
I feel like being slapped
with her slipper.

1364
01:56:53,472 --> 01:56:57,067
Already I'm ashamed to show
my face outside.

1365
01:56:57,343 --> 01:57:00,107
You may change but I'll never.
Never!

1366
01:57:00,613 --> 01:57:03,810
If I say kill, I mean it.

1367
01:57:04,150 --> 01:57:06,141
That's why I've ordered her death.

1368
01:57:06,319 --> 01:57:08,651
Who are you to order my wife's death?

1369
01:57:23,603 --> 01:57:25,264
The job is done, brother.

1370
01:57:34,347 --> 01:57:35,609
Did you kill?

1371
01:57:38,317 --> 01:57:39,784
Will you kill?

1372
01:57:40,753 --> 01:57:42,846
Will you kill my wife?

1373
01:58:13,152 --> 01:58:14,551
Get the vehicle,
let's take him to doctor.

1374
01:58:14,720 --> 01:58:19,555
If anyone tries to save
him, I'll kill them.

1375
01:58:19,725 --> 01:58:22,250
He's my loyal lieutenant.

1376
01:58:22,428 --> 01:58:25,295
If you stop me, I'll kill you.
- Shut up!

1377
01:58:25,464 --> 01:58:29,696
If he's your loyal lieutenant,
I'm your son.

1378
01:58:29,869 --> 01:58:31,928
I too have the same pride
as in your blood,

1379
01:58:32,271 --> 01:58:36,503
Body of the man who killed my wife
must decay in my courtyard.

1380
01:58:36,676 --> 01:58:39,424
If you stop me, I'll
not care father also.

1381
01:58:39,425 --> 01:58:42,171
I'll kill you!

1382
01:59:14,247 --> 01:59:17,580
Son... younger son!

1383
01:59:25,157 --> 01:59:28,593
Till now we were two groups,
yours and mine,

1384
01:59:28,928 --> 01:59:31,556
but you always had upper hand
and I was always beaten by you,

1385
01:59:31,731 --> 01:59:33,460
you killed my four sons,

1386
01:59:33,633 --> 01:59:37,125
I'll show you what it is
to lose grown up sons,

1387
01:59:37,303 --> 01:59:40,466
your younger son is dead,
your right hand will not come,

1388
01:59:40,640 --> 01:59:42,608
I'll kill your elder son too!

1389
01:59:42,942 --> 01:59:44,466
Come on!

1390
01:59:44,644 --> 01:59:46,669
Get him boys!

1391
02:00:07,533 --> 02:00:11,128
Sacrifice him like a goat at the altar.

1392
02:00:11,304 --> 02:00:14,762
Let me see who will come
to save your son's life.

1393
02:00:15,508 --> 02:00:18,136
Bloody! I'll come!

1394
02:00:36,462 --> 02:00:41,024
He has come... he has come!

1395
02:00:41,200 --> 02:00:44,499
I'll see your death today!

1396
02:02:02,214 --> 02:02:05,240
Hack... hack those bloody rogues!

1397
02:02:42,121 --> 02:02:43,110
My younger son!

1398
02:03:16,255 --> 02:03:19,850
I got at least my sons ashes,
you'll not get even that.

1399
02:03:20,192 --> 02:03:23,491
I'll wipe out your entire clan!

1400
02:04:24,823 --> 02:04:30,853
Over... it's all over, the long waging
war between two factions is over.

1401
02:04:30,963 --> 02:04:35,923
Munisamy and his men perished,
you too have lost your sons,

1402
02:04:36,268 --> 02:04:40,898
you made him your right hand,
he kept his promise,

1403
02:04:41,006 --> 02:04:44,999
he risked his life to save yours.

1404
02:05:12,738 --> 02:05:14,365
Haritha, little left.

1405
02:05:14,540 --> 02:05:15,939
Little right.

1406
02:05:16,275 --> 02:05:17,264
Okay?

1407
02:05:34,026 --> 02:05:37,462
My family today is like
what I wanted it to be like.

1408
02:05:38,530 --> 02:05:39,963
This is good,

1409
02:05:40,699 --> 02:05:42,792
but what if we face
Muthyam uncle some day?

1410
02:05:49,508 --> 02:05:50,475
Brother-in-law!

1411
02:05:50,909 --> 02:05:52,035
Pray dear!

1412
02:06:06,525 --> 02:06:09,653
Does he look like my right hand
to you also?

1413
02:06:12,031 --> 02:06:15,865
Not only him, this man is
also like him, that man too.

1414
02:06:16,035 --> 02:06:19,994
Everyone is appearing like him.

1415
02:06:21,340 --> 02:06:25,367
He was with us for many days,
that's why we feel like that.

1416
02:06:25,544 --> 02:06:26,841
It's hallucination.

1417
02:06:27,012 --> 02:06:27,774
Come.

1418
02:06:30,349 --> 02:06:33,876
I'm not God, you're God!

1419
02:06:34,386 --> 02:06:36,013
My family deity!

1420
02:06:38,023 --> 02:06:39,012
Go!

1421
02:06:40,693 --> 02:06:41,682
Thank you God!

1422
02:06:41,707 --> 02:06:45,707
