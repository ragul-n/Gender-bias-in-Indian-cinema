"There are no imprints
of your footsteps."

00:01:20,046 --> 00:01:23,584
"There is no heat in your fire."

4
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:27,188
"There is no emotions for your words."

5
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:30,564
"You are here, and still not here."

6
00:01:31,624 --> 00:01:35,128
"You are the soul without body."

7
00:01:35,195 --> 00:01:38,506
"You are the ash,
you are nothing."

8
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:42,235
"You are the soul without body."

00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:48,514
"Who are you,
what's your name, tell me."

10
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:51,320
"You can call me X."

11
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:54,981
"You can call me X."

12
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:58,429
"You can call me X."

13
00:02:00,019 --> 00:02:01,498
"Mr. X!"

14
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:05,364

00:02:10,763 --> 00:02:12,470
"You can call me X."

19
00:02:12,532 --> 00:02:14,205
"You can call him X."

20
00:02:14,267 --> 00:02:15,769
"Mr. X!"

21
00:02:32,952 --> 00:02:36,422
"Your fragrance pulls me."

22
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:39,993
"Your breaths heat up my body."

23
00:02:40,059 --> 00:02:43,529
"Your heartbeat only I have heard."

24
00:02:43,596 --> 00:02:47,703
"There is not even a shadow of yours."

25
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:52,347
"Your fragrance pulls me."

26
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:55,816
"Your breaths heat up my body."

27
00:02:56,075 --> 00:02:59,249
"Your heartbeat only I have heard."

28
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:03,651
"There is not even a shadow of yours."

29
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:10,957
"O unseen friend,
what kind of secret you are?"

30
00:03:11,157 --> 00:03:14,695
"O unseen friend.."

31
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:21,406
"..who are you,
what's your name, tell me."

32
00:03:21,801 --> 00:03:23,781
"You can call me X."

"Mr. X!"

36
00:03:36,015 --> 00:03:37,790
"You can call me X."

37
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:39,488
"You can call him X."

38
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:41,395
"You can call me X."

39
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:43,092
"You can call him X."

40

"You can call me X."

41
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:46,631
"You can call him X."

42
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:48,205
"Mr. X!"

43
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,301
Mr. X moves!

44
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:57,546
It dissolves, whether human heart.

45
00:03:57,637 --> 00:04:01,813
"Thirst for love, eternal!

46
00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:07,748
Love! Love! Love!

47
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:14,457
I'm feeling scared.

48
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:27,842
Move back. Move back.

49
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,379
Please clear the way.
Please.

50
00:04:32,071 --> 00:04:33,744
Raghu, it's the ACP.

51
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,419
Sir, we killed one of the men.

52
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:42,719
But the other one has handcuffed
himself to the steering wheel.

53
00:04:43,182 --> 00:04:45,128
And he has a bomb on him.

54
00:04:45,718 --> 00:04:46,958
If we gun him down..

55
00:04:47,053 --> 00:04:48,794
...he will trigger the bomb.

56
00:04:49,255 --> 00:04:51,394
And the people inside
the bus won't survive.

57
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,336
I know, sir,
but we can't ask for any more time.

58
00:04:57,563 --> 00:04:59,600
Raghu, the terrorist is on the line.

59
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:01,236
He wants to talk to you.

60
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:02,738
Sir, I'll call you back, sir.

61
00:05:02,835 --> 00:05:07,341
I shot two people dead,
you still don't get it.

62
00:05:08,074 --> 00:05:10,179
I'll keep shooting a person,
every five minutes"

63
00:05:10,243 --> 00:05:13,452
...till they are all dead
until you give me proof..

64
00:05:13,546 --> 00:05:17,016
"That my brother Akhtar
Maksood's been set free.

65
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:20,064
This is my last warning.

66
00:05:20,119 --> 00:05:21,723
It's not as easy as you think.

67
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:23,563
This requires special permission..

68
00:05:23,623 --> 00:05:25,068
...and that takes time.

69
00:05:25,124 --> 00:05:26,831
Please, we're trying.

70
00:05:26,926 --> 00:05:29,770
We're bringing him to you,
all we need is an hour.

71
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:33,174
Of course! You will get time!

72
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,711
After every five minutes.

73
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:40,074
But before that...
it's time for punishment.

74
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,711
Hello! Hello! Hello!

75
00:05:51,718 --> 00:05:52,958
Hey you!

76
00:05:53,886 --> 00:05:55,126
You, old man! You!

77
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:56,790
I'm talking to you!

78
00:05:57,223 --> 00:05:58,293
Get up, come on.

79
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:00,629
Get up!

80
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:04,205
Please spare me.

81
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,316
Rajiv, do you have a clear shot?

82
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:14,883
Yes, sir.

83
00:06:14,941 --> 00:06:17,148
Check carefully.
Do you have a clear shot?

84
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,181
I do, sir.

85
00:06:22,348 --> 00:06:24,328
Okay, on my command.
- Yes, sir.

86
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:25,888
Take the shot now.

87
00:06:31,657 --> 00:06:33,261
Okay, move in. Move in!

88
00:06:37,997 --> 00:06:39,533
Come on, guys, move out. Move out!

89
00:06:39,632 --> 00:06:40,906
Now! Move.

90
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,910
Quickly.

91
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:45,414
We only have three minutes.

92
00:06:45,505 --> 00:06:47,348
Come on, guys, hurry up.
- Move.

93
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:50,213
Move.

94
00:06:54,947 --> 00:06:56,517
Help them, go, Q0, 9Â°-

95
00:06:57,984 --> 00:07:00,726
Go...come on.

96
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:03,492
Come on, hurry up.

97
00:07:13,499 --> 00:07:14,637
There's someone inside.

98
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:17,575
Are you crazy? There is no time.
The bomb can blowup any minute.

99
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:18,808
Then diffuse this bomb.

100
00:07:18,871 --> 00:07:21,181
I won't be able to do it.
I can't do this.

101
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,221
I'm going to save that man.
I know you will save me.

102
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:28,925
I am his last hope, and you are mine.
You love me, don't you?

103
00:07:29,582 --> 00:07:30,959
Then just do it.

104
00:08:49,795 --> 00:08:52,867
ATD agents Raghuram
Rathod and Siya Verma..

105
00:08:52,965 --> 00:08:56,469
...put their lives at stake and
saved all the passengers.

106
00:08:57,003 --> 00:08:59,574
Raghu, I'm only having some soup.

107
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:02,346
What about you?
- Yeah, soup is fine.

108
00:09:02,408 --> 00:09:06,083
...demanded Akhtar Maksood
to be released from prison.

109
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:09,453
But ATD's successful
mission thwarted his plans.

110
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:24,431
Siya?

111
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,309
You have a death wish, don't you?

112
00:09:30,369 --> 00:09:33,873
Get out of my life.
Don't ever come back.

113
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:36,019
Just leave! Get out!

114
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:38,252
Just go!

115
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:50,060
Siya.

116
00:09:51,624 --> 00:09:53,194
Why do you do this?

117
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:58,105
You know...you're the only
person I have in this world.

118
00:09:58,364 --> 00:09:59,809
That's the reason why you trouble me.

119
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:01,405
Make me cry.

120
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:03,044
Shut me out!

121
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:05,140
I am sorry.

122
00:10:06,305 --> 00:10:07,648
I won't do it again.

123
00:10:08,307 --> 00:10:09,342
I promise.

124
00:10:09,408 --> 00:10:11,217
Don't make any promises.

125
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:21,724
You know what, this is it.

126
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:24,902
I don't want to be scared anymore.

127
00:10:26,058 --> 00:10:29,528
If we've to separate, then
why tomorrow. Let's pan ways today.

128
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:32,635
At least I can sleep
peacefully tonight.

129
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:34,802
I won't get any nightmares.

130
00:10:36,268 --> 00:10:38,805
Just leave, Raghu! Go!

131
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:12,708
You know we can't live
without each other.

132
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:15,913
And so...l make a promise to you today.

133
00:11:17,543 --> 00:11:20,251
I can only make half the promise today.

134
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:22,183
And the rest tomorrow.

135
00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:24,117
It's not funny, Raghu.

136
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:39,607
Siya Verma, will you marry me?

137
00:11:42,168 --> 00:11:44,148
I promise...

138
00:11:45,671 --> 00:11:48,242
...I'll buy a real ring tomorrow.

139
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:54,513
I've realized that there's
only one way to save my life.

140
00:11:55,948 --> 00:11:57,586
That I make you my life.

141
00:12:02,421 --> 00:12:09,737
"If I am there in the breath
of your breaths.."

142
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:12,742
"..then I exist."

143
00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:20,981
"if I am there in your dreams.."

144
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:23,747
"..then I exist."

145
00:12:24,844 --> 00:12:30,317
"I am from your being.."

146
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:35,627
"..to lose you is like
to lose myself."

147
00:12:35,688 --> 00:12:41,036
"if you are there, I am there.."

148
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:46,042
"..if it's like that, then I am."

149
00:12:46,665 --> 00:12:52,013
"if you are there, I am there.."

150
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:58,278
"..if it's like that, then I am."

151
00:13:20,599 --> 00:13:25,599
"Without you, what's mine,
that I should hear or say.."

152
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:36,610
"..without you what's in me,
which I should live, in which to live."

153
00:13:43,255 --> 00:13:48,102
"In you alone my life is there.."

154
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:53,838
"..in a moment of yours,
my centuries are there."

155
00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:58,899
"Without you I am like a desert,
without you, I am not even a drop."

156
00:14:05,277 --> 00:14:10,818
"I am from your being.."

157
00:14:10,883 --> 00:14:16,060
"..to lose you is like
to lose myself."

158
00:14:16,121 --> 00:14:21,537
"if you are there, I am there.."

159
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:26,566
"..if it's like that, then I am."

160
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:31,706
Siya.

161
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:36,277
Your dad will be released
from jail this week.

162
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:42,689
If you want to get
married after that...

163
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,460
No!

164
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:48,895
I don't want to wait for him!

165
00:14:49,922 --> 00:14:54,922
"You are on my face,
staying there like some relief."

166
00:15:01,267 --> 00:15:06,267
"I too am in your hands,
like fate, all scattered."

167
00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:17,311
"You are as if my soul,
on touching you I feel living."

168
00:15:23,522 --> 00:15:28,522
"Whenever I see myself,
even within myself, I feel like you."

169
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:40,039
"I am from your being.."

170
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:45,350
"..to lose you is like
to lose myself."

171
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:50,827
"if you are there, I am there.."

172
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:56,229
"..if it's like that, then I am."

173
00:15:56,488 --> 00:16:01,938
"if you are there, I am there.."

174
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:07,807
"..if it's like that, then I am."

175
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:30,565
Hello.
- Hello.

176
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:36,039
Yeah, but.. - But I clearly
said yesterday was my last day, and..

177
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:39,474
<i>Okay'</i>

178
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,236
Okay, fine. I'll come.

179
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:44,070
Yeah, fine.

180
00:16:48,707 --> 00:16:50,516
ACP's called us.

181
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:53,455
Emergency meeting!

182
00:16:58,117 --> 00:17:00,154
Can I now have my shin back please?

183
00:17:01,387 --> 00:17:02,491
Why?

184
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:07,329
If you can keep me in your heart.

185
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,707
...then can't I keep your shin on me?

186
00:17:12,431 --> 00:17:13,637
You can.

187
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:16,076
But what good is it to you?

188
00:17:16,168 --> 00:17:19,445
I'm not in it.
- But your fragrance is..

189
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:25,546
...it stays with me, when you don't.

190
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:28,085
You won't need it.

191
00:17:28,747 --> 00:17:31,785
Because tomorrow we'll be married..

192
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:33,952
...and be together.

193
00:17:34,753 --> 00:17:38,667
And then no cold-crumpled
shin needed when a hot guy is here.

194
00:17:40,325 --> 00:17:42,999
And...we still have 15 minutes.

195
00:17:54,873 --> 00:17:55,874
Raghu.

196
00:17:55,941 --> 00:17:57,352
Raghu.
- Hi, Popo.

197
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:58,217
Hi.
- Hi.

198
00:17:58,277 --> 00:18:01,952
Raghu, I've got something for you.

199
00:18:08,987 --> 00:18:10,830
What's this..
- My sister has sent this for you.

200
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:13,597
We repaid all our debts.

201
00:18:15,527 --> 00:18:18,474
Popo, l..
- It's all because of you, Raghu.

202
00:18:18,864 --> 00:18:20,673
You showed faith in me.

203
00:18:20,732 --> 00:18:25,044
It's all because of you, that a boy who
lived in a shanty finally owns a house.

204
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:28,714
Thanks, buddy.

205
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:32,047
Popo, only capable
people can be trusted.

206
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:35,087
And I did a favor to the ATD, not you.

207
00:18:35,514 --> 00:18:37,755
The department needed
a computer expert.

208
00:18:37,816 --> 00:18:39,454
...and I fulfilled their need.

209
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:43,763
I told my sister that you
would say something similar.

210
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:46,832
That's why she chose
this gift for you.

211
00:18:47,092 --> 00:18:49,299
You're like God to us.

212
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:52,165
Now let me work.

213
00:18:52,264 --> 00:18:56,576
Two weeks ago we received information
that a terrorist group is in this city..

214
00:18:56,668 --> 00:19:00,741
...with a plan to murder
the CM before the elections.

215
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:05,379
We were verifying this information
when a man was arrested.

216
00:19:05,944 --> 00:19:07,014
Sayeed Naqvi!

217
00:19:09,781 --> 00:19:11,624
He was arrested on Nepal Border.

218
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:15,429
During interrogation,
he admitted we were correct.

219
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:18,957
...and revealed the
name of the mastermind.

220
00:19:20,692 --> 00:19:25,198
Munna Jaiswal. He's been accused for
numerous murders in UP.

221
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:27,243
And he's also on the wanted list.

222
00:19:27,733 --> 00:19:31,340
He's been staying
in Mumbai's Seashore hotel.

223
00:19:31,403 --> 00:19:34,407
And like always,
there's a woman with him.

224
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:38,044
Only this time,
the woman is an undercover agent.

225
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:40,784
And she's trying
to extract information"

226
00:19:40,879 --> 00:19:42,790
...of the CM's assassination
plot from him.

227
00:19:42,981 --> 00:19:46,258
Munna might not step out of the room.

228
00:19:46,318 --> 00:19:50,095
We've bugged his room and we'll
be able to hear his conversations.

229
00:19:50,155 --> 00:19:52,829
He's staying in 402,
and our team is in 401.

230
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:54,165
Now for your assignments.

231
00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:58,765
Siya, stay in 401 and
monitor his conversations.

232
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:02,174
And if required,
protect that girl.

233
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:06,474
Raghu, Tiwari and you
will stay with the Minister.

234
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:10,911
ATD's presence is crucial
along with Zed plus security.

235
00:20:13,178 --> 00:20:15,124
Sir..
- Raghu, I know.

236
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:16,555
You're on leave.

237
00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:18,288
You two are getting married tomorrow.

238
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:22,957
I am really sorry but,
this is just for today.

239
00:20:23,288 --> 00:20:26,861
Today I need my best people.

240
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:35,144
It's okay.

241
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:37,308
It's just a day.

242
00:20:38,003 --> 00:20:38,538
Good.

243
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:08,404
Anand, heard anything important?
- Yes, I did.

244
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:12,143
How his mother made
meat-soup for him in winter.

245
00:21:12,204 --> 00:21:13,410
Listen to this.

246
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:21,254
This day is the onset
of a new tomorrow.

247
00:21:22,214 --> 00:21:23,955
Today we will decide..

248
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:33,130
Whether we will serve our
city better than our predecessors.

249
00:21:33,425 --> 00:21:35,632
Or will we just rule this city?

250
00:21:36,428 --> 00:21:43,505
Today, when my son
Aditya accompanied me..

251
00:21:43,902 --> 00:21:48,078
...I realized that
the younger generation"

252
00:21:48,173 --> 00:21:51,154
"wants to know our intentions.

253
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:00,062
Raghu, come in!

254
00:22:00,118 --> 00:22:01,495
Raghu, come in!

255
00:22:02,387 --> 00:22:05,664
Go for Raghu.
- Look to your left..

256
00:22:06,024 --> 00:22:07,697
...where the entire media's standing.

257
00:22:11,596 --> 00:22:15,510
Fourth man in the first row,
wearing the brown jacket.

258
00:22:19,471 --> 00:22:21,007
Check his camera angle.

259
00:22:24,042 --> 00:22:25,919
His camera is on a low angle..

260
00:22:26,578 --> 00:22:29,525
As if he's shooting the carpet,
not the CM.

261
00:22:30,115 --> 00:22:32,117
Strange!
- Exactly.

262
00:22:32,818 --> 00:22:35,128
I'll check it out.
- Okay.

263
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:36,421
Careful.

264
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:08,156
Excuse me.

265
00:23:10,355 --> 00:23:11,333
Hey you.

266
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:14,166
Stop! I said stop!

267
00:23:55,367 --> 00:23:58,177
I wish we could let
you sleep a little longer.

268
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:02,611
But, we're out of time.

269
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:09,520
You see...we've found the
assassin who wants to kill the CM.

270
00:24:10,816 --> 00:24:12,124
It's you!

271
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:14,123
What nonsense?

272
00:24:14,386 --> 00:24:15,592
Is this a joke?

273
00:24:15,654 --> 00:24:17,463
You think this is a joke.

274
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:21,202
You know, our seniors were right.

275
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:24,797
Those working for the department
should not fall in love with each other.

276
00:24:25,363 --> 00:24:28,901
Who knows what trouble
their love can get them in.

277
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:31,379
Tiwari.

278
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:37,579
Oh, Tiwari.
Who cares about the sniper?

279
00:24:37,776 --> 00:24:40,848
We want to see the target.

280
00:24:45,383 --> 00:24:48,557
Poor girl think she's
serving the country.

281
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:50,827
She doesn't know that
she's being held captive by us.

282
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:03,942
Go...now...right now..

283
00:25:04,402 --> 00:25:08,214
...to the convention hall,
and kill the CM.

284
00:25:09,241 --> 00:25:11,414
Or else Siya dies.

285
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:14,282
Think that you're doing
it for your country.

286
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,816
Are you out of your mind?

287
00:25:17,716 --> 00:25:19,457
Kill the Chief Minister
for the sake of the country?

288
00:25:19,551 --> 00:25:21,053
Your plan will never succeed.

289
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:22,495
You will be caught!

290
00:25:22,587 --> 00:25:23,531
You won't escape capital punishment.

291
00:25:23,588 --> 00:25:25,090
That's why you will kill him.

292
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:29,501
You see, I was wondering..

293
00:25:29,594 --> 00:25:33,838
...who else, other than Siya
and you could crack this case?

294
00:25:35,066 --> 00:25:38,206
Then I thought...what
if the investigators".

295
00:25:38,303 --> 00:25:40,806
...turned out to be the murderers.

296
00:25:42,107 --> 00:25:44,109
Democracy has a rule.

297
00:25:44,576 --> 00:25:48,547
Corrupt the best...and forget the rest.

298
00:25:48,613 --> 00:25:50,991
I will never be a pan of this plan.

299
00:25:51,783 --> 00:25:53,854
Amar!
- Rajiv!

300
00:26:05,797 --> 00:26:07,208
He's understood.

301
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,072
Take him away.

302
00:26:11,369 --> 00:26:13,542
Don't try to be too clever.

303
00:26:13,972 --> 00:26:15,542
I've the sniper's
number on speed dial..

304
00:26:15,607 --> 00:26:17,348
...and his finger is on the trigger,.

305
00:26:24,382 --> 00:26:27,659
Apart from technology,
what are your other plans?

306
00:26:28,053 --> 00:26:30,294
Yes in many departments.

307
00:26:30,555 --> 00:26:33,968
Like e-Commerce, Infrastructure.

308
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:36,733
Airports in small cities.

309
00:26:37,395 --> 00:26:39,841
Sir, my name's Raghuram Rathod.

310
00:26:39,898 --> 00:26:42,003
I work for ATD.
- Yes.

311
00:26:42,067 --> 00:26:47,039
And you just assaulted ACP,
Tiwari and Amar and fled.

312
00:26:48,573 --> 00:26:50,075
That wasn't the right thing to do.

313
00:26:50,976 --> 00:26:52,717
See this phone.

314
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,926
The sniper's on the line.

315
00:26:57,949 --> 00:27:03,627
As soon as I disconnect the call,
he'll kill your fiancee.

316
00:27:04,255 --> 00:27:07,793
So I suggest that
you go back to Tiwari..

317
00:27:08,093 --> 00:27:10,630
"Take the gun and do your job.

318
00:27:12,364 --> 00:27:13,741
Now go!

319
00:27:36,354 --> 00:27:38,595
What an amateurish question?

320
00:27:39,357 --> 00:27:43,828
How can you start something
new without good ideas?

321
00:27:44,529 --> 00:27:47,738
That's why we've put together
a team for R and D..

322
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:26,280
And we are trying our best
to control the inflation.

323
00:28:27,172 --> 00:28:32,121
I am very happy that
the public have all the support...

324
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:36,222
We're still planning the budget.

325
00:28:36,281 --> 00:28:39,353
But there's one thing
I would like to say.

326
00:28:40,118 --> 00:28:43,258
These are not expenditures.

327
00:28:43,488 --> 00:28:48,233
In fact, they are good
investments for a better future.

328
00:28:48,293 --> 00:28:50,534
And there are many other"

329
00:28:55,533 --> 00:28:56,841
Yes?

330
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,022
Move! Move!

331
00:29:17,122 --> 00:29:18,760
Come on! Move!

332
00:29:18,823 --> 00:29:19,699
Move!

333
00:29:23,495 --> 00:29:25,270
That way. Follow him!

334
00:29:29,634 --> 00:29:30,806
Come on.

335
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,110
Siya.

336
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:41,181
Just turn on the TV.
- Why? What happened?

337
00:29:41,246 --> 00:29:42,725
Just turn it on.

338
00:29:48,052 --> 00:29:49,588
And the biggest news
at the moment is..

339
00:29:49,654 --> 00:29:52,225
"That CM Dwarkanath
Dutta was shot dead.

340
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:55,999
And what's surprising is,
that his assailant"

341
00:29:56,094 --> 00:29:58,506
...is none other than
ATD's renowned agent.

342
00:29:58,596 --> 00:30:00,633
...who was bestowed with his security.

343
00:30:00,698 --> 00:30:02,405
And his name's Raghuram Rathod.

344
00:30:02,667 --> 00:30:04,408
According to sources
he's still at large.

345
00:30:04,502 --> 00:30:06,539
Police and ATD are in hot pursuit.

346
00:31:30,588 --> 00:31:33,364
I don't want to be
a pan of your game.

347
00:31:36,027 --> 00:31:38,303
Siya is waiting for me.

348
00:31:39,831 --> 00:31:42,141
I will explain everything to her.

349
00:31:43,668 --> 00:31:47,309
We'll leave the ATD
and the city go far away.

350
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:52,043
You will never see us again.
- Okay.

351
00:32:00,385 --> 00:32:04,265
No! Actually, you don't get it.

352
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:13,709
All this has no connection
with the CM's death.

353
00:32:14,232 --> 00:32:17,873
This is about electing the next CM.

354
00:32:18,469 --> 00:32:20,176
Aditya Dutta.

355
00:32:20,638 --> 00:32:25,883
From a useless son he's become
an orphan in a single day!

356
00:32:26,711 --> 00:32:31,820
He'll now win the election,
his father would have lost.

357
00:32:32,383 --> 00:32:33,953
<i>SVmDathy vote.</i>

358
00:32:34,652 --> 00:32:38,065
And I'll be the Commissioner.

359
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:42,230
That boy will make
me the Commissioner.

360
00:32:42,327 --> 00:32:44,238
And I want it.

361
00:32:45,897 --> 00:32:53,179
And you want me to throw away that position,
power, money for your love-story.

362
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:57,715
Believe me.

363
00:32:58,876 --> 00:33:01,117
No one will know I am alive.

364
00:33:01,212 --> 00:33:05,991
Believe me.
Everyone will know you're dead.

365
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:14,937
Blow him up along with this place.

366
00:34:22,193 --> 00:34:24,332
Nobody talks to anybody,
I want everything shut down.

367
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:25,407
Okay, sir.

368
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:40,720
Don't be so harsh on yourself, Siya.

369
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:45,959
And anyway,
it's not right for you to be here.

370
00:34:59,831 --> 00:35:01,401
Get to it.
- Okay, sir.

371
00:35:07,572 --> 00:35:09,415
We looked everywhere.

372
00:35:10,241 --> 00:35:12,847
We scanned the entire area,
but couldn't find a body.

373
00:35:13,177 --> 00:35:17,455
The blast was so powerful,
that...every1hing turned to dust.

374
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:28,301
Raghuram Rathod could've
been a terrorist as well.

375
00:35:28,359 --> 00:35:29,337
How is it possible that"

376
00:35:29,427 --> 00:35:33,307
...ATD had no clue about
an informer amongst them?

377
00:35:33,364 --> 00:35:36,277
We're just as surprised as all of you.

378
00:35:36,334 --> 00:35:38,837
He was one of our best! Yes.

379
00:35:38,936 --> 00:35:40,711
Do you think,
with the elections around the bend..

380
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:43,445
...there could be someone wanting
to eliminate the Chief Minister.

381
00:35:43,541 --> 00:35:45,384
That's just a conspiracy theory, no!

382
00:35:45,443 --> 00:35:47,684
Question for officer Siya Verma.

383
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:49,049
Siya.

384
00:35:49,113 --> 00:35:50,615
Our sources have informed us..

385
00:35:50,715 --> 00:35:53,093
"That you were going
to marry Raghuram Rathod today.

386
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:55,097
Do you think he was
using this as an excuse"

387
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:58,464
...to buy some time
and plan for this murder?

388
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:28,341
Send the report.
- Okay.

389
00:38:28,406 --> 00:38:30,044
Hold on.

390
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:37,222
Hello.

391
00:38:41,919 --> 00:38:42,897
Popo.

392
00:38:44,722 --> 00:38:45,860
Raghu.

393
00:38:47,458 --> 00:38:50,371
I am not dead.

394
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:58,809
Raghu, where are you?

395
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:01,176
Hi, Popo.

396
00:39:03,207 --> 00:39:04,277
Siya!

397
00:39:06,777 --> 00:39:08,279
What are you doing here?

398
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:10,581
Coming here is a necessity, sir.

399
00:39:10,981 --> 00:39:13,757
Only my work can
save me from this shock.

400
00:39:14,118 --> 00:39:17,065
How else can I forget
what happened with me?

401
00:39:17,121 --> 00:39:20,432
I understand, Siya, but..
- Please, sir.

402
00:39:21,992 --> 00:39:26,702
It's important for me
to know why Raghu betrayed me.

403
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:35,112
Where's Raghu, Popo?
- Come with me, please.

404
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:35,911
Yeah.

405
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:41,648
Oh my, God!

406
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:42,986
Oh my, God! Popo, please.

407
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,718
Please take him to a hospital.
- No, sis..

408
00:39:44,782 --> 00:39:47,524
We can't take him to the hospital.
ATD will find out.

409
00:39:47,618 --> 00:39:49,097
And they will hunt him down.

410
00:39:49,153 --> 00:39:51,394
We need to pretend that Raghu is dead.

411
00:39:51,455 --> 00:39:52,627
Popo, why don't you understand.

412
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:54,795
"That this is a medical company,
not a hospital.

413
00:39:54,859 --> 00:39:56,167
Please.
- He cannot be treated here.

414
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:58,036
Please, sis. You're our last hope.
You have to do something.

415
00:39:58,129 --> 00:40:00,575
Please, Popo, nothing can be done.
- Please, sis.

416
00:40:02,366 --> 00:40:04,243
Okay, fine. I'll open the backdoor.

417
00:40:04,335 --> 00:40:06,144
Come in through there.
- Okay.

418
00:40:15,546 --> 00:40:17,082
Popo... Oh, God.

419
00:40:19,483 --> 00:40:22,089
Quickly, Popo.
On the couch. Just be careful.

420
00:40:40,538 --> 00:40:41,676
Raghu.

421
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:44,217
The cold water will lessen
the burning sensation.

422
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:47,085
Raghu, you have to be strong.

423
00:40:47,745 --> 00:40:49,918
Come on, Raghu. Get up.

424
00:40:50,014 --> 00:40:52,221
Be careful.
- Every1hing will be fine.

425
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:53,785
Don't worry, Raghu. Come on.

426
00:40:54,885 --> 00:40:57,024
Careful, Raghu.
- Careful.

427
00:41:06,997 --> 00:41:10,001
Raghu! You need to be strong.

428
00:41:10,067 --> 00:41:11,546
Come on, Raghu.

429
00:41:12,036 --> 00:41:13,982
Come on, Raghu.
- You can do it.

430
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,015
Raghu, you have to do it.

431
00:41:18,742 --> 00:41:20,278
Don't worry, Raghu.

432
00:41:20,377 --> 00:41:21,355
Come on, Raghu.

433
00:41:21,445 --> 00:41:22,423
Raghu.

434
00:41:27,084 --> 00:41:29,462
Oh my, God!
- What happened?

435
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:37,294
Raghu's clothes have melted
into his skin completely.

436
00:41:37,728 --> 00:41:39,674
If we try to take off his clothes"

437
00:41:39,763 --> 00:41:42,004
...we'll peel off his skin as well.

438
00:41:42,633 --> 00:41:45,705
Wonder what chemicals or radiation"

439
00:41:46,203 --> 00:41:49,673
...Raghu was exposed
to in that refinery?

440
00:41:50,374 --> 00:41:53,548
His cellular structure
isn't that of a normal man.

441
00:41:53,644 --> 00:41:57,592
But definitely...something's
changed in him.

442
00:41:58,148 --> 00:41:59,650
What do you mean by changed?

443
00:41:59,717 --> 00:42:01,754
What do we do now?

444
00:42:06,724 --> 00:42:09,432
Popo, I can treat his burns, but..

445
00:42:09,493 --> 00:42:11,166
But for the radiation"

446
00:42:29,113 --> 00:42:33,061
All I have is this to counter
this level of radiation.

447
00:42:34,018 --> 00:42:35,122
What will this do?

448
00:42:35,185 --> 00:42:38,962
Raghu, this is an
anti-radiation medicine.

449
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:43,037
We're still researching
it in our laboratory.

450
00:42:44,728 --> 00:42:47,641
It hasn't been tested yet.

451
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:49,809
Not even on a rat.

452
00:42:50,334 --> 00:42:52,837
It will either help you...

453
00:42:54,104 --> 00:42:56,209
...or kill you, Raghu.

454
00:42:57,207 --> 00:42:59,448
This medicine might kill me.

455
00:43:01,779 --> 00:43:04,089
But without it, I will surely die.

456
00:43:04,315 --> 00:43:05,760
Something like that.

457
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:10,151
Raghu! Raghu!
' No. Popo!

458
00:44:10,214 --> 00:44:11,215
What's happening to Raghu?

459
00:44:11,281 --> 00:44:14,194
It's the effect of the radiation.
it can react in any way

460
00:44:17,621 --> 00:44:19,999
Raghu! Raghu! Raghu!

461
00:44:28,532 --> 00:44:29,670
Raghu!

462
00:44:40,244 --> 00:44:40,984
Raghu!

463
00:44:41,078 --> 00:44:42,489
Raghu! No, Raghu.

464
00:45:30,427 --> 00:45:33,533
Sometimes we can see him,
sometimes we can't.

465
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:36,639
But...how is this happening?

466
00:45:38,936 --> 00:45:41,075
The most I know is that"

467
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:43,612
...the more it realizes,
it knows nothing.

468
00:45:47,344 --> 00:45:50,848
If we breakdown white-light,
we can see seven colors.

469
00:45:51,915 --> 00:45:53,986
Redder then red, Infra-red.

470
00:45:54,084 --> 00:45:56,826
And more violet than violet itself,
ultra-violet.

471
00:45:58,155 --> 00:46:01,159
But he's only reflecting ultra-violet.

472
00:46:02,826 --> 00:46:06,569
That means we can see
him in direct sunlight.

473
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:10,407
...or under any blue neon light,
at night.

474
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:14,412
But, sister,
his skin's completely healed.

475
00:46:14,505 --> 00:46:18,954
And even his hair..
- It's like a complete cell regeneration.

476
00:46:19,042 --> 00:46:20,715
Including hair.

477
00:46:20,778 --> 00:46:23,349
When science doesn't have an answer..

478
00:46:23,647 --> 00:46:25,752
...then, there's just
one explanation for it.

479
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:27,019
God!

480
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:28,357
This is a miracle.

481
00:46:30,921 --> 00:46:33,197
I wonder what happened
in that factory.

482
00:46:34,391 --> 00:46:36,200
This is an effect of that.

483
00:46:40,164 --> 00:46:42,508
If I don't take the medicine,
I'll die.

484
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:45,405
And if I do,
no one will be able to see me.

485
00:46:47,037 --> 00:46:49,176
A life that's worse than death.

486
00:47:09,693 --> 00:47:12,606
I must have done something
wrong that God is punishing me.

487
00:47:14,031 --> 00:47:17,478
But, Raghu, you could be wrong.

488
00:47:18,035 --> 00:47:21,573
Maybe God has a plan...a reason.

489
00:47:22,306 --> 00:47:24,013
What reason?

490
00:47:24,708 --> 00:47:28,485
Siya! God kept you alive for her.

491
00:47:29,246 --> 00:47:30,782
For her love.

492
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:44,871
Hello, dear.

493
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:51,540
Well...l went to your old place..

494
00:47:52,402 --> 00:47:54,473
Found out you live here now.

495
00:47:58,308 --> 00:48:00,083
Won't you invite me in?

496
00:48:04,781 --> 00:48:05,885
Thank you.

497
00:48:06,950 --> 00:48:10,295
I brought chocolates for you,
your favorite.

498
00:48:12,522 --> 00:48:14,524
I've stopped eating chocolates.

499
00:48:16,493 --> 00:48:18,370
Joseph invited me to dinner yesterday.

500
00:48:19,129 --> 00:48:21,666
A lot of ATD officers were there too.

501
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:24,713
During the conversation,
somebody mentioned you.

502
00:48:26,169 --> 00:48:28,149
They were all praises.

503
00:48:28,872 --> 00:48:31,944
They were saying...
you're just like your father.

504
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:36,316
Those you talked to
don't know me well.

505
00:48:37,681 --> 00:48:39,092
10 years, Siya!

506
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:41,919
It's been 10 years!

507
00:48:43,153 --> 00:48:46,100
Can't you forget
the past and forgive me?

508
00:48:46,156 --> 00:48:47,294
10 years!

509
00:48:48,191 --> 00:48:52,537
Is that enough time to forgive
my mother's murderer?

510
00:48:52,629 --> 00:48:57,169
For God's sake, Siya.
I didn't kill your mother!

511
00:48:57,734 --> 00:49:01,341
And you know the truth.
- Of course I do.

512
00:49:03,073 --> 00:49:06,077
The truth is that she
was the best crime journalist"

513
00:49:06,176 --> 00:49:07,951
...and you used her.

514
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:12,158
The truth is that, she believed
all your encounter killings..

515
00:49:12,249 --> 00:49:14,354
...were real police killings.

516
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:18,563
The truth is that, she never
believed that you're a murderer.

517
00:49:18,889 --> 00:49:21,495
The truth is,
she believed all your lies...

518
00:49:21,591 --> 00:49:24,094
...and published
them on the front page.

519
00:49:26,430 --> 00:49:31,038
The truth is...she was heart-broken
after finding out the truth.

520
00:49:32,169 --> 00:49:36,140
And she finally committed suicide

521
00:49:37,607 --> 00:49:39,678
You've been in the ATD long enough.

522
00:49:40,711 --> 00:49:42,850
I thought you would've
understood by now that"

523
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:45,558
...in order to do something right
you've to do something wrong.

524
00:49:45,615 --> 00:49:48,186
If you need to do something
wrong to do the right thing..

525
00:49:48,518 --> 00:49:50,794
...then, that thing can never be right.

526
00:49:51,922 --> 00:49:54,869
Now if you don't mind,
Mr. Verma. Get out of my house!

527
00:50:05,402 --> 00:50:08,110
I heard, that the man who
killed that corrupt chief minister..

528
00:50:08,739 --> 00:50:10,582
...was your fiancee.

529
00:50:12,175 --> 00:50:14,382
So have you stopped loving him too?

530
00:50:19,416 --> 00:50:23,091
Not just stopped loving him,
I've learned to hate him.

531
00:50:23,487 --> 00:50:28,766
I hate him... his existence...
his every lie.

532
00:50:29,059 --> 00:50:31,903
He was nothing more
than an embodiment of lies.

533
00:50:32,295 --> 00:50:35,401
He was a murderer, worse than you.

534
00:50:36,166 --> 00:50:38,077
It's said that before hating someone..

535
00:50:38,468 --> 00:50:41,312
...you should walk in his shoes.

536
00:50:42,606 --> 00:50:44,677
You will realize his helplessness.

537
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:48,846
If someone's helplessness forces him
to do wrong, then he has no humanity.

538
00:50:49,179 --> 00:50:51,216
And as far as Raghu's concerned.

539
00:50:51,615 --> 00:50:54,960
He's done a big favor on me by dying.

540
00:50:55,485 --> 00:50:59,729
I won't have to pretend he's dead,
like I do for you.

541
00:50:59,823 --> 00:51:05,830
"Your fragrance, and your breaths."

542
00:51:07,431 --> 00:51:13,609
"..gradually, I'll forget it all."

543
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:21,079
"The creases that you have left.."

544
00:51:22,612 --> 00:51:28,893
"..l will remove them all slowly."

545
00:51:30,353 --> 00:51:37,635
"There is a long age to pass.."

546
00:51:37,961 --> 00:51:44,845
"..behind whom do you run
for no reason."

547
00:51:45,569 --> 00:51:51,315
"if the eyes are wet, let them.."

548
00:51:53,210 --> 00:51:58,853
"..but let the lips still smile."

549
00:52:00,851 --> 00:52:05,851
"I'll slowly drag away my morning
from her nights."

550
00:52:16,566 --> 00:52:18,341
'Siya Verma, will you marry me?'

551
00:52:18,869 --> 00:52:20,712
'I'm going to be your wife.'

552
00:52:21,938 --> 00:52:23,747
'I will always stay close to you.'

553
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:39,024
'Siya is waiting for me.'

554
00:52:44,361 --> 00:52:48,070
'We will leave the ATD and this city,
and go far away. - No!'

555
00:52:51,635 --> 00:52:55,173
Not just stopped loving him,
I've learned to hate him.

556
00:52:55,539 --> 00:52:58,019
'To do the right thing,
you've to do something wrong.'

557
00:53:33,109 --> 00:53:34,179
Raghu!

558
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:43,925
You were right.

559
00:53:44,955 --> 00:53:47,162
There's a reason
that I am still alive.

560
00:53:48,124 --> 00:53:50,001
But it's not love, like you thought.

561
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:51,104
What?

562
00:53:53,630 --> 00:53:56,304
Arjun always needs Krishna.

563
00:53:57,133 --> 00:53:59,773
But sometimes even
Krishna needs Arjun.

564
00:54:01,338 --> 00:54:04,808
He kept me alive to fight,
not for love.

565
00:54:05,675 --> 00:54:06,949
For revenge.

566
00:54:08,845 --> 00:54:11,189
If the devil is working
from the shadows..

567
00:54:12,382 --> 00:54:14,760
...then, even God will
have to fight him in secret.

568
00:54:50,687 --> 00:54:54,157
Hey, mister, did your car breakdown?

569
00:54:55,859 --> 00:54:58,601
Who's pushing this thing?

570
00:55:00,530 --> 00:55:04,842
Hey...no one's pushing,
so how's the car moving?

571
00:55:08,705 --> 00:55:10,685
How are you, Tiwari?

572
00:55:21,451 --> 00:55:23,453
Oh God please save me!

573
00:55:23,553 --> 00:55:25,931
Oh God please save me!

574
00:55:31,728 --> 00:55:33,867
Oh God please save me!

575
00:55:34,964 --> 00:55:37,069
Oh God please save me!

576
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:39,613
Where are you running off to? Stop!

577
00:55:44,274 --> 00:55:46,447
Hello...hello...
- Listen to me, Tiwari.

578
00:55:46,509 --> 00:55:48,853
Hello..
- Hey, Tiwari.

579
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:50,389
Hello.

580
00:55:50,447 --> 00:55:52,552
Give the phone to Ajay!

581
00:55:53,116 --> 00:55:54,993
This is Tiwari.

582
00:55:55,151 --> 00:55:56,653
Listen to me, Tiwari.

583
00:55:56,753 --> 00:56:00,200
Ajay! Did you mix
something in my drink?

584
00:56:01,624 --> 00:56:03,501
You swear you didn't?

585
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:05,171
You swear you didn't?

586
00:56:05,261 --> 00:56:06,331
Listen, Tiwari.

587
00:56:06,396 --> 00:56:08,876
Then this is definitely a ghost.

588
00:56:41,631 --> 00:56:43,838
Why are you chasing me?

589
00:56:44,334 --> 00:56:46,405
What have I done to you?

590
00:56:59,849 --> 00:57:04,889
Who are you? - Tiwari,
I can kill you right now if I want.

591
00:57:05,221 --> 00:57:08,134
But I am not a
scoundrel like your ATD!

592
00:57:09,826 --> 00:57:14,104
I am warning you
that you have only 24 hours.

593
00:57:14,964 --> 00:57:17,570
After that I will kill you.

594
00:57:20,069 --> 00:57:24,609
Go tell your department
to save you if they can.

595
00:57:28,745 --> 00:57:30,918
But why do you want to kill me?

596
00:57:31,481 --> 00:57:33,654
What have I done to you?

597
00:57:34,984 --> 00:57:36,088
Who are you?

598
00:57:38,755 --> 00:57:41,861
What I was, burned to ashes.

599
00:57:42,826 --> 00:57:44,635
Now I am just a shadow.

600
00:57:45,528 --> 00:57:47,235
My name's Mr. X!

601
00:57:48,198 --> 00:57:50,007
And I am your death!

602
00:57:52,836 --> 00:57:54,713
"You can call me X."

603
00:57:56,439 --> 00:57:58,248
"You can call me X."

604
00:57:59,943 --> 00:58:01,889
"You can call me X."

605
00:58:03,546 --> 00:58:04,991
"Mr. X!"

606
00:58:06,049 --> 00:58:08,552
Mr. X! Mr. X!
Mr. X, that's his name.

607
00:58:08,618 --> 00:58:09,596
Whose name?
- His?

608
00:58:09,652 --> 00:58:10,926
Who's he?
- I don't know.

609
00:58:10,987 --> 00:58:13,092
You don't know whose Mr. X?
- I don't know.

610
00:58:13,156 --> 00:58:15,329
But he said he's Mr. X!
- Who?

611
00:58:15,425 --> 00:58:16,495
I don't know.

612
00:58:16,593 --> 00:58:19,540
So you didn't see him?
- I didn't, because he stays invisible.

613
00:58:19,629 --> 00:58:21,973
Where does he stay?
- There?

614
00:58:22,031 --> 00:58:23,339
Where there?

615
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:25,844
I don't know his whereabouts.
- So where did you see him?

616
00:58:25,902 --> 00:58:27,108
L...l saw him on the road.

617
00:58:27,203 --> 00:58:29,740
How does he look?
- He's invisible.

618
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:31,978
Then how did you see him?
- I didn't see him.

619
00:58:32,075 --> 00:58:33,679
Then who did.
- No one did.

620
00:58:33,743 --> 00:58:34,881
Then what did you see?

621
00:58:34,944 --> 00:58:36,287
L...l..

622
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:37,882
Who is Mr. X?

623
00:58:38,147 --> 00:58:39,922
It's him! Him!

624
00:58:40,450 --> 00:58:42,452
Why don't you understand, sir?

625
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:45,466
He was hiding in the
mist while talking to me.

626
00:58:46,155 --> 00:58:48,294
Are you high, Tiwari?

627
00:58:48,992 --> 00:58:52,337
If he's invisible,
how did you see him in the mist?

628
00:58:52,762 --> 00:58:55,470
Sir...try to understand.

629
00:58:55,532 --> 00:58:57,978
He's threatened to kill me.

630
00:58:58,034 --> 00:59:00,537
He will kill me within 24 hours.

631
00:59:00,603 --> 00:59:02,276
Sir! Sir!

632
00:59:02,672 --> 00:59:03,980
Sir, we can't ignore this!

633
00:59:04,073 --> 00:59:06,075
Ignore what, he's gone mad!

634
00:59:06,276 --> 00:59:08,187
But how could he go
crazy in a single day.

635
00:59:08,244 --> 00:59:10,224
He was fine until yesterday.

636
00:59:12,448 --> 00:59:14,758
Sir, there's nothing
wrong in being cautious.

637
00:59:15,118 --> 00:59:17,962
If it's just his hallucination,
we'll ignore him.

638
00:59:19,088 --> 00:59:22,535
But if it is true,
then he's in danger.

639
00:59:26,729 --> 00:59:30,302
Don't worry, this is the
last place he'll look for you.

640
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:33,078
No one will come in.
This room is secure.

641
00:59:33,336 --> 00:59:35,680
Be careful Siya! Siya!

642
00:59:36,372 --> 00:59:38,579
Amar, I want two bouncers here.

643
00:59:38,675 --> 00:59:40,677
An X-ray machine and a metal detector.

644
00:59:40,743 --> 00:59:42,745
Whoever comes here,
goes through it. - Yes.

645
00:59:42,812 --> 00:59:44,382
There will be a big
crowd here at night.

646
00:59:44,447 --> 00:59:45,926
There'll be music and singing.

647
00:59:45,982 --> 00:59:48,292
I want 4 ATD officers here.

648
00:59:48,384 --> 00:59:50,921
And nobody gets distracted.
Is that clear? - Okay?

649
01:00:02,899 --> 01:00:12,479
"Nowadays, you are the one
who's in my every thought."

650
01:00:13,176 --> 01:00:21,789
"Believe me, you have become
the reason for me living my life."

651
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:27,659
"You are the most likeable one,
you are omnipresent."

652
01:00:27,757 --> 01:00:32,729
"You have charmed even God,
you are the form of love."

653
01:00:32,795 --> 01:00:37,835
"You are the most likeable one,
you are omnipresent."

654
01:00:37,934 --> 01:00:43,646
"You have charmed even God,
you are the form of love."

655
01:01:06,529 --> 01:01:08,634
Danger! Danger!

656
01:01:08,698 --> 01:01:09,699
Danger!

657
01:01:09,899 --> 01:01:10,900
Danger!

658
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:11,740
What are you saying?

659
01:01:11,834 --> 01:01:14,474
X-ray machine... he's lying down!

660
01:01:15,104 --> 01:01:17,175
Kadam, are you drunk?
- No, sir.

661
01:01:17,373 --> 01:01:19,182
Are you drunk?
- Just a little"

662
01:01:19,409 --> 01:01:28,329
"Look, you are in my
every spoken word."

663
01:01:29,585 --> 01:01:38,630
"Listen, you are the one
who is flowing with my sound."

664
01:01:39,062 --> 01:01:44,034
"I'm in such place
where you can't see yourself."

665
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:49,072
"I'm the reason your heart is beating."

666
01:01:49,172 --> 01:01:54,144
"I'm that bit that is shining
because of your radiance."

667
01:01:54,243 --> 01:01:59,886
"I'm the morning
which arose after darkness."

668
01:01:59,982 --> 01:02:03,225
"Yes, you are such morning."

669
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:09,594
"You are the most likeable one,
you are omnipresent."

670
01:02:09,692 --> 01:02:15,074
"You have charmed even God,
you are the form of love."

671
01:02:15,131 --> 01:02:19,807
"You are the most likeable one,
you are omnipresent."

672
01:02:19,902 --> 01:02:25,614
"You have charmed even God,
you are the form of love."

673
01:02:35,852 --> 01:02:45,205
"Look, you are like that same dream
which resides in my eyes."

674
01:02:46,028 --> 01:02:55,278
"It's true, you are the one
who is in my sleep every day."

675
01:02:55,338 --> 01:03:00,219
"I'm separated and
unknown from my own self."

676
01:03:00,676 --> 01:03:05,648
"I am not even in my own self,
you only tell me where I am now."

677
01:03:05,748 --> 01:03:10,288
"I'm standing on the
shores of your dreams."

678
01:03:10,386 --> 01:03:10,796
What?

679
01:03:10,887 --> 01:03:16,337
"Turn around and look at me,
I'm a trace that belongs to you."

680
01:03:16,425 --> 01:03:19,599
"You are my trace."

681
01:03:21,063 --> 01:03:26,137
"You are the most likeable one,
you are omnipresent."

682
01:03:26,202 --> 01:03:31,208
"You have charmed even God,
you are the form of love."

683
01:03:31,307 --> 01:03:36,313
"You are the most likeable one,
you are omnipresent."

684
01:03:36,379 --> 01:03:41,852
"You have charmed even God,
you are the form of love."

685
01:03:57,834 --> 01:03:58,744
Hello..

686
01:04:30,399 --> 01:04:31,639
Mr. X!

687
01:04:34,837 --> 01:04:38,717
Mr. X, I don't know
what I did to harm you.

688
01:04:39,475 --> 01:04:43,013
But whatever I did, please forgive me.

689
01:04:43,079 --> 01:04:44,558
I am sorry.

690
01:04:44,614 --> 01:04:45,854
I am sorry.

691
01:04:48,751 --> 01:04:50,287
Do you know the meaning
of 'sorry' Tiwari?

692
01:04:55,424 --> 01:04:58,371
Raghu? You're Mr. X!

693
01:04:58,461 --> 01:05:01,032
Sorry means you won't
repeat your mistake again.

694
01:05:01,964 --> 01:05:04,001
But your apology makes no difference.

695
01:05:04,901 --> 01:05:07,814
I won't give you another
opportunity to make a mistake.

696
01:05:10,039 --> 01:05:10,983
Stop it!

697
01:05:12,308 --> 01:05:14,686
Stop it! Let Tiwari go.

698
01:05:15,011 --> 01:05:17,287
Let him go. I said leave him.

699
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:18,988
Let him go.

700
01:05:19,148 --> 01:05:20,218
Leave him!

701
01:05:22,518 --> 01:05:23,588
Tiwari!

702
01:06:22,111 --> 01:06:25,217
'But what good is it to you?
I'm not in it.'

703
01:06:25,681 --> 01:06:27,388
'But your subtle fragrance is..'

704
01:06:28,017 --> 01:06:33,228
'...it stays with me...when you don't.'

705
01:06:33,856 --> 01:06:41,070
"if I am there in the breath
of your breaths.."

706
01:06:41,163 --> 01:06:43,769
"..then I exist."

707
01:06:45,001 --> 01:06:52,283
"if I am there in your dreams.."

708
01:06:52,341 --> 01:06:55,845
"..then I exist."
- Raghu!

709
01:06:56,112 --> 01:07:01,357
"I am from your being.."
- I know it's you!

710
01:07:01,717 --> 01:07:06,791
"..To lose you is like to lose myself."
-You betrayed me!

711
01:07:06,856 --> 01:07:11,930
"If you are there, I am there.."

712
01:07:12,528 --> 01:07:17,068
Raghu!
- "..if it's like that, then I am."

713
01:07:17,433 --> 01:07:20,903
I know you're listening!
- "if you are there, I am there.."

714
01:07:20,970 --> 01:07:23,541
You took advantage of my love once..

715
01:07:23,873 --> 01:07:25,784
"But, you can't do it anymore.

716
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:28,321
Because that love
doesn't exist anymore.

717
01:07:28,644 --> 01:07:30,885
I hate you!

718
01:07:31,147 --> 01:07:33,093
I hate you!

719
01:07:33,649 --> 01:07:36,892
And I swear,
no matter how hard you try to hide..

720
01:07:36,952 --> 01:07:38,954
...I will find you.

721
01:07:39,021 --> 01:07:42,264
I will find you! I will arrest you!

722
01:07:42,658 --> 01:07:44,331
You cannot escape from me.

723
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:45,834
Did you hear?

724
01:07:45,928 --> 01:07:47,737
You cannot escape from me.

725
01:07:47,830 --> 01:07:50,674
Raghu! I will find you.

726
01:07:51,567 --> 01:07:53,706
You cannot escape from me, Raghu!

727
01:07:54,470 --> 01:07:56,347
You cannot escape from me.

728
01:09:08,944 --> 01:09:10,184
'Hi, Popo.'

729
01:09:25,527 --> 01:09:28,872
Popo, I need to talk to you.

730
01:09:29,698 --> 01:09:33,145
Is there a problem?
- Come with me.

731
01:09:41,676 --> 01:09:43,587
I want to tell you
something important.

732
01:09:43,645 --> 01:09:46,125
But you won't tell anyone, promise me.

733
01:09:46,481 --> 01:09:48,119
Promise. Tell me.

734
01:09:49,317 --> 01:09:50,990
Popo, I've information that"

735
01:09:51,086 --> 01:09:54,590
...the man who killed Tiwari is Mr.X.

736
01:09:55,657 --> 01:09:56,658
It's Raghu.

737
01:09:59,227 --> 01:10:01,503
No! Not possible.

738
01:10:01,696 --> 01:10:06,202
Raghu is dead.
I mean how can he be alive, Siya?

739
01:10:06,535 --> 01:10:07,513
Not just that.

740
01:10:07,569 --> 01:10:10,448
Bhardwaj is certain
that you've been meeting Raghu.

741
01:10:10,539 --> 01:10:11,950
And also helping him.

742
01:10:12,040 --> 01:10:15,544
Why me? I'm not meeting anyone, Siya.

743
01:10:15,610 --> 01:10:17,954
Do you trust me, Siya?
- I do.

744
01:10:18,013 --> 01:10:20,152
That's why I'm trying to warn you.

745
01:10:20,382 --> 01:10:22,259
Popo, you're my best friend.

746
01:10:22,551 --> 01:10:25,054
And I don't want
to see you in trouble.

747
01:10:25,153 --> 01:10:28,293
Your phone's been tapped too.
- My phone's been tapped.

748
01:10:28,356 --> 01:10:30,734
But why?
I don't know anyone, Siya.

749
01:10:30,825 --> 01:10:33,066
Mr. X... Mr. Y...
I don't want to get into all this.

750
01:10:33,161 --> 01:10:35,300
I'm a very simple man..
- No need to worry.

751
01:10:35,363 --> 01:10:37,172
You haven't done anything,
have you? - No.

752
01:10:37,465 --> 01:10:39,172
So relax, don't worry.

753
01:10:39,367 --> 01:10:40,345
Come on!

754
01:10:42,971 --> 01:10:44,951
Raghu! Raghu!

755
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:46,817
Everything's messed up, Raghu.

756
01:10:46,875 --> 01:10:48,718
Let's go, they know every1hing.

757
01:10:48,777 --> 01:10:51,417
They know every1hing.
- What do they know?

758
01:10:51,479 --> 01:10:54,323
That you're Mr. X...and you..

759
01:10:54,416 --> 01:10:56,123
Stop asking questions.
You're in danger.

760
01:10:56,184 --> 01:10:57,254
Come with me, Raghu.

761
01:10:57,319 --> 01:10:59,993
Look, Raghu,
they've already tapped my phone.

762
01:11:00,055 --> 01:11:02,797
And they'll come here looking for you.
My sister works here.

763
01:11:02,891 --> 01:11:04,802
Let's go, Raghu..
- Hold on.

764
01:11:04,859 --> 01:11:06,668
Who told you that your phone's tapped?

765
01:11:06,728 --> 01:11:08,765
Siya did. She's a friend after all.

766
01:11:09,397 --> 01:11:12,844
She was warning me.
- She played you.

767
01:11:13,602 --> 01:11:15,639
She knew you would panic
and come here straightaway.

768
01:11:16,037 --> 01:11:19,575
And when you do..
- Then I'll follow you here too.

769
01:11:20,909 --> 01:11:22,115
You're right.

770
01:11:37,726 --> 01:11:39,967
Raghuram Rathod, you're under arrest.

771
01:11:40,028 --> 01:11:43,475
...for the murder of an ATD official
and the Chief Minister of the state.

772
01:11:52,040 --> 01:11:53,314
Arrest me?

773
01:11:55,777 --> 01:11:56,983
H ow?

774
01:11:57,212 --> 01:11:58,589
What do you mean by how?

775
01:11:59,481 --> 01:12:00,983
Don't you know...

776
01:12:02,317 --> 01:12:03,955
...I can disappear?

777
01:12:07,489 --> 01:12:09,059
Very impressive trick, Raghu.

778
01:12:10,025 --> 01:12:14,167
You can disappear,
but poor Popo can't.

779
01:12:15,030 --> 01:12:19,410
And if you don't surrender yourself,
I will arrest him.

780
01:12:19,701 --> 01:12:21,772
For harboring a murderer.

781
01:12:22,170 --> 01:12:25,811
Raghu, Siya's become dangerous.
Don't reveal yourself.

782
01:12:25,907 --> 01:12:29,445
Come on, Raghu. You know this
is an open and shut case of abetment.

783
01:12:29,511 --> 01:12:32,788
There's no case here, Raghu.
Don't listen to her at all.

784
01:12:32,847 --> 01:12:35,191
He'll be sentenced
for at least 7 years.

785
01:12:35,283 --> 01:12:37,593
I'm not afraid of serving time.

786
01:12:37,652 --> 01:12:39,893
Think about it, what after that?

787
01:12:39,954 --> 01:12:42,400
Nothing.
Just don't show yourself.

788
01:12:42,490 --> 01:12:44,026
You gave him a better life..

789
01:12:44,125 --> 01:12:46,765
...and his future will
be ruined because of you.

790
01:12:46,861 --> 01:12:49,307
Forget the future, think about
the present. Don't reveal yourself.

791
01:12:49,364 --> 01:12:50,775
You decide.

792
01:12:58,039 --> 01:13:01,282
Very impressive... Siya Verma.

793
01:13:01,976 --> 01:13:04,923
You still have some
humanity left in you.

794
01:13:29,971 --> 01:13:31,814
Hey...are you crazy?

795
01:13:46,454 --> 01:13:48,127
Hey-"my bike!

796
01:16:17,572 --> 01:16:18,414
Siya!

797
01:17:14,662 --> 01:17:16,198
The gun's empty-

798
01:17:29,577 --> 01:17:33,081
Load it up, and point it at me.

799
01:17:38,519 --> 01:17:40,226
And you can shoot me too.

800
01:17:40,688 --> 01:17:43,362
But before you do,
listen to what I have to say.

801
01:17:44,425 --> 01:17:48,066
The entire world watched
me shoot the Chief Minister.

802
01:17:48,763 --> 01:17:50,071
And it's true.

803
01:17:50,264 --> 01:17:52,540
But there's a truth
behind this murder..

804
01:17:53,334 --> 01:17:55,041
...which no one is aware of.

805
01:17:55,470 --> 01:17:59,145
Except for me, and the people...
who had a gun pointed at you..

806
01:17:59,674 --> 01:18:01,551
...in Hotel Seashore's room no. 401.

807
01:18:04,145 --> 01:18:05,351
What?

808
01:18:08,349 --> 01:18:10,090
I had no choice.

809
01:18:10,685 --> 01:18:12,358
It was either you
or the Chief Minister!

810
01:18:12,453 --> 01:18:14,160
I had to save either one.

811
01:18:15,256 --> 01:18:16,963
And I made my decision.

812
01:18:18,059 --> 01:18:20,039
I killed him so you could live.

813
01:19:02,770 --> 01:19:04,909
I doubted you.

814
01:19:05,873 --> 01:19:10,288
I forgot all that love. I hated you.

815
01:19:11,379 --> 01:19:14,223
I am sorry, Raghu. I am so sorry.

816
01:19:16,317 --> 01:19:18,661
You can never really hate me.

817
01:19:19,554 --> 01:19:21,500
We've both been wronged.

818
01:19:22,690 --> 01:19:23,964
But not anymore.

819
01:19:24,792 --> 01:19:26,738
I want their names.

820
01:19:27,228 --> 01:19:29,970
I will expose them
in front of the world.

821
01:19:30,498 --> 01:19:32,569
I'll see to it that they're hanged.

822
01:19:32,633 --> 01:19:33,839
No, Siya.

823
01:19:34,535 --> 01:19:36,606
They are not common criminals.

824
01:19:36,838 --> 01:19:39,444
These are powerful people.
They're bigger than the law.

825
01:19:39,807 --> 01:19:42,413
They make their own laws,
and also break them.

826
01:19:43,578 --> 01:19:45,524
You cannot lay a finger on them.

827
01:19:46,914 --> 01:19:48,916
That's why it's best to stay quiet.

828
01:19:49,484 --> 01:19:51,589
Your silence will protect you.

829
01:19:53,054 --> 01:19:56,831
And you? What will you do?

830
01:20:07,235 --> 01:20:08,771
I will kill them.

831
01:20:09,270 --> 01:20:11,272
Tiwari's death was just the beginning.

832
01:20:12,573 --> 01:20:14,052
Two more to go.

833
01:20:14,909 --> 01:20:16,047
Raghu?

834
01:20:17,044 --> 01:20:19,524
Are you saying you will murder them?

835
01:20:20,248 --> 01:20:21,921
Without thinking about the law?

836
01:20:22,083 --> 01:20:23,289
Law?

837
01:20:27,021 --> 01:20:31,470
The law is ineffective
and I don't need it.

838
01:20:31,726 --> 01:20:33,228
I don't believe this.

839
01:20:34,729 --> 01:20:36,731
A protector of the law..

840
01:20:37,165 --> 01:20:39,202
...is talking about breaking the law.

841
01:20:39,267 --> 01:20:41,338
You can't break what's
already broken, Siya.

842
01:20:42,370 --> 01:20:44,611
I've seen the real face of the law..

843
01:20:45,139 --> 01:20:47,210
...that I was trying to protect.

844
01:20:47,275 --> 01:20:49,277
Fake...hollow...lifeless!

845
01:20:49,510 --> 01:20:51,512
Never helps the poor and helpless.

846
01:20:52,180 --> 01:20:54,387
And favors the rich and the cruel.

847
01:20:54,949 --> 01:20:58,226
It can...if you help it.

848
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:01,396
I just want to help myself, Siya.

849
01:21:01,756 --> 01:21:04,236
You're not like this.

850
01:21:04,692 --> 01:21:09,402
The Raghu I know would
never think like this.

851
01:21:10,498 --> 01:21:15,072
That Raghu...turned
to dust in that refinery.

852
01:21:16,437 --> 01:21:17,916
Raghu. Raghu.

853
01:21:18,372 --> 01:21:19,783
Raghu, please listen to me.

854
01:21:19,874 --> 01:21:21,876
Just listen to me.
Don't break the law.

855
01:21:21,943 --> 01:21:23,320
Please.
- Siya, stop.

856
01:21:23,377 --> 01:21:25,050
Raghu, we can do this together.

857
01:21:25,112 --> 01:21:27,353
We can get them..
- Siya, stay out of it!

858
01:21:32,186 --> 01:21:33,722
Stay out of it!

859
01:21:34,121 --> 01:21:35,998
And become like my father?

860
01:21:37,358 --> 01:21:39,338
All my life, I've worked hard..

861
01:21:39,393 --> 01:21:42,863
...to be different from my dad.

862
01:21:44,165 --> 01:21:47,009
And now...you want me to be like him.

863
01:21:47,635 --> 01:21:51,742
Turn a blind eye because
Raghuram Rathod wants his revenge.

864
01:21:51,806 --> 01:21:53,410
Look at me!

865
01:21:54,075 --> 01:21:56,555
I'm neither dead,
nor is this life worth living.

866
01:21:57,345 --> 01:22:00,053
My dreams,
my future, they took every1hing.

867
01:22:01,015 --> 01:22:03,757
We can't have a home, can't have kids.
We can't get married.

868
01:22:04,452 --> 01:22:06,090
I'll keep yearning all my life.

869
01:22:07,722 --> 01:22:09,827
And you want me to
forgive those people.

870
01:22:11,058 --> 01:22:12,560
I am not that great a man!

871
01:22:12,660 --> 01:22:14,571
You don't understand, Raghu.

872
01:22:15,830 --> 01:22:18,970
You will try to kill them,
and I'll try to save them.

873
01:22:20,034 --> 01:22:22,947
You wanted to save me and now,
you will be competing with me.

874
01:22:23,337 --> 01:22:25,078
Is that what you want?

875
01:22:27,341 --> 01:22:28,820
If I have to.

876
01:22:31,312 --> 01:22:32,313
Raghu

877
01:22:34,782 --> 01:22:38,855
if you love me...
then you won't do this.

878
01:22:39,987 --> 01:22:41,591
And if you love me..

879
01:22:42,823 --> 01:22:44,530
...then you will let
me have my revenge.

880
01:22:44,859 --> 01:22:46,930
Then...we're both helpless.

881
01:22:57,605 --> 01:22:59,312
Raghu! Raghu!

882
01:23:53,728 --> 01:23:55,571
Where did you get these photographs?

883
01:23:55,963 --> 01:23:59,638
Sir, I know who Mr. X is.
- You do?

884
01:23:59,967 --> 01:24:00,945
Yes, sir.

885
01:24:02,803 --> 01:24:04,077
Raghu is Mr. X.

886
01:24:10,111 --> 01:24:12,216
Other than Tiwari and Aditya..

887
01:24:12,546 --> 01:24:16,653
"There was a third person,
who conspired to kill the CM.

888
01:24:17,485 --> 01:24:19,692
He told me this himself.

889
01:24:20,421 --> 01:24:24,597
But I covered this up until now.
- I see.

890
01:24:28,229 --> 01:24:31,972
This means... Raghu isn't dead.

891
01:24:32,566 --> 01:24:34,705
Raghu wants to protect me..

892
01:24:34,769 --> 01:24:36,771
...by not telling me
who that third person is.

893
01:24:36,837 --> 01:24:40,614
But he wants revenge
for what happened with him.

894
01:24:41,642 --> 01:24:45,055
Raghu's anger is justified,
but his method is wrong.

895
01:24:45,413 --> 01:24:48,826
Before he does something else,
we need to arrest him..

896
01:24:49,083 --> 01:24:53,259
...and find out all those
who were involved in that plan.

897
01:24:53,888 --> 01:24:57,028
I agree, but we can
only arrest someone we see.

898
01:24:57,525 --> 01:24:59,402
What do we do about
someone who's invisible?

899
01:25:03,330 --> 01:25:05,310
Sir, there's one way to catch him.

900
01:25:05,599 --> 01:25:08,705
Is there no other way to catch him
apart from using me as bait?

901
01:25:08,769 --> 01:25:10,908
It's not about that,
it's about revenge.

902
01:25:11,906 --> 01:25:14,409
Siya has confirmed
that Raghu is Mr. X.

903
01:25:15,142 --> 01:25:19,022
He killed Tiwari.
Now he's coming for you, and then me.

904
01:25:19,313 --> 01:25:22,021
I'm saving myself too.

905
01:25:22,116 --> 01:25:24,153
You're the ACP, just arrest him.

906
01:25:24,251 --> 01:25:27,755
He's invisible.
How will we go after him?

907
01:25:28,289 --> 01:25:31,930
The only way is to
wait for him to come.

908
01:25:32,159 --> 01:25:33,536
Which he will.

909
01:25:33,727 --> 01:25:36,333
To kill you. He will definitely come.
And then we will get him.

910
01:25:36,597 --> 01:25:39,601
And Siya.
You say that only she can save me.

911
01:25:39,667 --> 01:25:43,547
She is the best.
She's your only hope.

912
01:25:58,052 --> 01:25:59,122
Popo.

913
01:26:04,058 --> 01:26:05,696
Do you see that motorcade?
- Yes.

914
01:26:06,260 --> 01:26:08,638
Siya's going to shift
Aditya to some safe place.

915
01:26:10,831 --> 01:26:12,174
Ready?

916
01:26:14,235 --> 01:26:16,613
I'll plant this
transmitter on the car.

917
01:26:18,038 --> 01:26:21,076
Amar, you go in this car.
I'll follow you in that one.

918
01:26:44,765 --> 01:26:48,042
Popo, come in.
- Going strong, Raghu.

919
01:26:48,469 --> 01:26:51,507
They just left in their car.
They are taking a left.

920
01:26:52,439 --> 01:26:54,851
And now they're taking a right.

921
01:26:55,109 --> 01:26:59,057
Everything's fine, Raghu.
- Fine. I am coming back.

922
01:27:00,247 --> 01:27:01,692
Hold on! Hold on!

923
01:27:02,283 --> 01:27:04,593
Raghu, the gate's opening again.

924
01:27:11,692 --> 01:27:14,298
It's the minister's lookalike.

925
01:27:14,361 --> 01:27:16,272
A second motorcade has arrived, Raghu.

926
01:27:16,564 --> 01:27:17,565
What?

927
01:27:18,165 --> 01:27:19,200
What?

928
01:27:27,041 --> 01:27:29,248
Another one.
That's the third.

929
01:27:35,749 --> 01:27:38,059
Our plan has completely failed, Raghu.

930
01:27:38,152 --> 01:27:39,688
They're going to
pull a disappearing act.

931
01:27:46,160 --> 01:27:48,140
Siya! Siya! Siya!

932
01:27:48,395 --> 01:27:50,932
She must have spent
a lot of time recently"

933
01:27:51,031 --> 01:27:53,910
...in the place where
she's taking Aditya.

934
01:27:54,435 --> 01:28:00,477
You just need to hack into her phone and
find out which cell tower she was close to.

935
01:28:01,275 --> 01:28:02,618
I will do the rest.

936
01:28:02,876 --> 01:28:04,913
Raghu, you're thinking
like a hacker, huh!

937
01:28:04,979 --> 01:28:06,356
Done...I'll locate her.

938
01:28:18,892 --> 01:28:20,565
Found her.
Raghu.

939
01:28:21,595 --> 01:28:25,441
In the last 24 hours, Siya
was close to just one cellphone tower.

940
01:28:25,532 --> 01:28:28,411
And that cellphone tower is..

941
01:28:34,308 --> 01:28:35,719
That one.

942
01:28:45,185 --> 01:28:47,324
Aditya wasn't in any of the cars.

943
01:28:49,657 --> 01:28:53,230
Because the real Aditya
Dutta is still in the house.

944
01:29:16,750 --> 01:29:19,026
What's that noise?
What's going on?

945
01:29:34,234 --> 01:29:36,646
This isn't Raghu.
Quick...Plan B, now!

946
01:29:36,704 --> 01:29:37,739
Go!

947
01:29:48,282 --> 01:29:50,819
Despite all our efforts Raghu is here.

948
01:29:50,884 --> 01:29:53,228
And in spite of all your efforts,
he will kill me.

949
01:29:53,287 --> 01:29:54,561
That won't happen.

950
01:29:54,621 --> 01:29:55,691
Raghu managed to get here..

951
01:29:55,789 --> 01:29:57,200
...but the only place
he'll be going is behind bars.

952
01:29:57,291 --> 01:29:59,100
Amar, stay alert.
- Okay.

953
01:30:01,028 --> 01:30:02,735
Go aheadmanoint me.

954
01:30:02,930 --> 01:30:03,704
Sacrifice me.

955
01:30:36,897 --> 01:30:39,275
Come on, Raghu. What's your plan?

956
01:31:03,724 --> 01:31:05,032
Fire.

957
01:31:05,492 --> 01:31:07,369
Only fire turns these sprinklers on.

958
01:31:07,795 --> 01:31:10,674
He's started a fire.
He wants to kill me.

959
01:31:10,731 --> 01:31:13,109
He wants to burn me to ashes.

960
01:31:17,404 --> 01:31:18,382
This way.

961
01:31:18,572 --> 01:31:20,882
Not this way, that way.
Go. Go.

962
01:31:21,008 --> 01:31:22,544
Where are you taking me?
- Let's go. Come on.

963
01:31:22,643 --> 01:31:23,678
He won't spare me.

964
01:31:23,744 --> 01:31:24,779
Get in, fast.
- Get in.

965
01:31:24,878 --> 01:31:26,221
He won't spare me.
- Please get inside.

966
01:31:26,780 --> 01:31:28,487
You don't understand.

967
01:31:33,554 --> 01:31:34,464
See. . . see..

968
01:31:34,555 --> 01:31:35,795
He managed to sneak in my house..

969
01:31:35,889 --> 01:31:38,130
...and your commandoes
stood there blank.

970
01:31:38,192 --> 01:31:40,536
No one could do anything.
And you were supposed to save me.

971
01:31:40,627 --> 01:31:42,334
So save me.
- You'll be fine.

972
01:31:42,396 --> 01:31:44,933
Even after every1hing that happened,
you still say I'll be fine.

973
01:31:45,032 --> 01:31:46,773
He will kill me.

974
01:31:48,335 --> 01:31:49,370
No..

975
01:31:51,405 --> 01:31:52,645
Raghu, let go.

976
01:31:53,574 --> 01:31:54,712
Raghu!

977
01:31:58,712 --> 01:31:59,747
Raghu!

978
01:32:00,113 --> 01:32:01,421
Raghu, let go.

979
01:32:01,648 --> 01:32:02,683
Raghu!

980
01:32:05,953 --> 01:32:07,364
Raghu, leave.

981
01:32:11,391 --> 01:32:12,461
Let go.

982
01:32:29,409 --> 01:32:30,114
Come on.

983
01:32:30,177 --> 01:32:31,815
Where are you taking me?
- Come on.

984
01:32:31,912 --> 01:32:33,619
He won't spare me.
- Come on. Come on.

985
01:32:33,680 --> 01:32:34,784
He won't spare anyone.

986
01:32:34,882 --> 01:32:35,883
He will kill everyone.

987
01:32:35,949 --> 01:32:38,156
He won't spare anyone.
- Shut up! Shut up!

988
01:32:38,919 --> 01:32:41,365
We need to disappear in the crowd.
Do you understand?

989
01:32:44,258 --> 01:32:45,703
Come on. Come on.

990
01:32:47,995 --> 01:32:49,872
What...are you doing?

991
01:32:50,097 --> 01:32:51,735
Here, give my brother
whatever he wants.

992
01:32:53,834 --> 01:32:56,075
Amar, I am at G7 Mall.
I need backup now.

993
01:32:56,136 --> 01:32:58,116
Aditya's with me
and Raghu's after us.

994
01:32:58,205 --> 01:32:59,206
NOW!

995
01:33:19,426 --> 01:33:20,461
Save me.

996
01:33:23,897 --> 01:33:25,740
Raghu, stop!

997
01:33:27,568 --> 01:33:28,308
Save me.

998
01:33:28,402 --> 01:33:30,109
Raghu, stop!

999
01:33:39,146 --> 01:33:40,648
Raghu, stop!

1000
01:33:44,384 --> 01:33:45,658
Raghu, stop.

1001
01:34:15,749 --> 01:34:18,628
Everything's fair in love and war,
sweetheart.

1002
01:34:19,519 --> 01:34:23,092
And then this is love and war.

1003
01:34:28,028 --> 01:34:29,166
Mr. X?

1004
01:34:29,229 --> 01:34:32,267
Who is he? What is his game plan?

1005
01:34:32,532 --> 01:34:35,240
This never before
seen or heard, Mr. X..

1006
01:34:35,302 --> 01:34:38,476
...was first seen in this mall.

1007
01:34:38,572 --> 01:34:42,076
Hey, I've heard that
Mr. X is very cute.

1008
01:34:42,142 --> 01:34:43,951
What rubbish?
How do you know?

1009
01:34:44,011 --> 01:34:44,921
He's invisible.

1010
01:34:44,978 --> 01:34:48,255
You know, if Mr. X
helps us in robbing a bank..

1011
01:34:48,315 --> 01:34:50,022
...we'll give him 10 percent.

1012
01:34:50,117 --> 01:34:51,892
No, no, no, not 10 percent.

1013
01:34:52,185 --> 01:34:54,688
I swear...l heard sir
talking on the phone.

1014
01:34:54,788 --> 01:34:56,290
This Mr. X is a terrorist.

1015
01:34:56,356 --> 01:34:57,994
You just hear, and don't think.

1016
01:34:58,058 --> 01:35:01,699
No one yet knows when Mr. X
is visible, and when he's not.

1017
01:35:01,762 --> 01:35:03,207
But our sources tell us..

1018
01:35:03,263 --> 01:35:05,334
...that the government
is investigating this matter.

1019
01:35:05,399 --> 01:35:09,575
The truth is Mr. X is a thought.

1020
01:35:09,870 --> 01:35:11,315
He's an idea.

1021
01:35:11,805 --> 01:35:13,079
The human mind..

1022
01:35:13,140 --> 01:35:15,586
Have you seen the new
Facebook page of Mr. X?

1023
01:35:15,809 --> 01:35:16,514
Not yet, why?

1024
01:35:16,610 --> 01:35:18,817
It's got more than 1
million likes in 24 hours.

1025
01:35:18,912 --> 01:35:21,153
You see, a man becoming invisible..

1026
01:35:21,248 --> 01:35:23,421
...is nothing more than
a biological revolution.

1027
01:35:23,483 --> 01:35:25,861
We're still doing research.

1028
01:35:25,919 --> 01:35:27,125
And I'm completely sure.

1029
01:35:27,187 --> 01:35:29,360
Please sir, just one more try.
Just give me one more chance.

1030
01:35:29,456 --> 01:35:31,402
I'm sorry, Siya, it's too late.

1031
01:35:31,491 --> 01:35:34,097
I have orders from my superiors.
- What?

1032
01:35:34,194 --> 01:35:36,936
Did you tell them that
Raghu is Mr. X? - No.

1033
01:35:37,030 --> 01:35:40,136
But it doesn't make a difference now.
- What do you mean?

1034
01:35:42,436 --> 01:35:44,643
I've orders from the
Home Secretary, Delhi.

1035
01:35:45,806 --> 01:35:48,309
Whether Mr. X
is Raghu or someone else.

1036
01:35:49,209 --> 01:35:50,847
The orders are shoot at sight.

1037
01:35:55,282 --> 01:35:57,262
I am sorry, sir, I didn't understand.

1038
01:36:00,020 --> 01:36:03,263
They want us to prepare
a team of our best officers.

1039
01:36:03,623 --> 01:36:05,500
And of course you'll
be leading that team.

1040
01:36:05,559 --> 01:36:10,304
And no matter what it takes,
we kill Mr. X

1041
01:36:19,072 --> 01:36:20,415
You mean just like that?

1042
01:36:20,941 --> 01:36:24,354
No arrest, no case or legal proceedings?
- Yes, Siya.

1043
01:36:24,644 --> 01:36:25,918
Those are the instructions.

1044
01:36:25,979 --> 01:36:27,754
Then what's the difference
between Raghu and us.

1045
01:36:27,814 --> 01:36:30,988
Sometimes you have to break
the law for the sake of justice.

1046
01:36:33,453 --> 01:36:36,923
Then I should join hands with
Raghu because he says the same thing.

1047
01:36:36,990 --> 01:36:38,697
It's not the same thing.

1048
01:36:38,792 --> 01:36:41,033
He's a murderer, we're not.

1049
01:36:42,062 --> 01:36:44,702
Not yet, but we will be.

1050
01:36:45,599 --> 01:36:49,137
Someone tried to kill him.
Now he wants revenge.

1051
01:36:49,236 --> 01:36:51,944
Next we'll take revenge.
Then someone else will strike back.

1052
01:36:52,038 --> 01:36:53,984
So when does it all stop?

1053
01:36:54,074 --> 01:36:57,283
Siya, I'm giving you a choice.

1054
01:36:57,811 --> 01:37:00,951
Either you kill him along
with our team, or else..

1055
01:37:03,316 --> 01:37:04,590
Or else what?

1056
01:37:05,952 --> 01:37:08,865
We've decided,
that officer Siya Verma..

1057
01:37:09,322 --> 01:37:12,531
...who was entrusted with
the security of Aditya Dutta..

1058
01:37:12,626 --> 01:37:14,731
...will face strict legal action.

1059
01:37:14,828 --> 01:37:17,240
Till then she is suspended.

1060
01:37:17,330 --> 01:37:19,674
Ms. Siya, is it true
that you've been suspended?

1061
01:37:19,733 --> 01:37:22,009
Which officer will investigate
this case in your place?

1062
01:37:22,068 --> 01:37:25,140
I've letdown my department
by not performing my duty.

1063
01:37:25,205 --> 01:37:31,178
I could not save Aditya Dutta
and so I have been suspended.

1064
01:37:31,244 --> 01:37:33,155
The department's decision is right.

1065
01:38:02,742 --> 01:38:04,187
Why have you come here, Raghu?

1066
01:38:18,291 --> 01:38:19,668
To humiliate me?

1067
01:38:20,193 --> 01:38:21,695
Make me feel more depressed.

1068
01:38:21,895 --> 01:38:23,340
What for?

1069
01:38:29,669 --> 01:38:31,239
See the outcome
of telling the truth?

1070
01:38:32,439 --> 01:38:33,975
You're all alone now.

1071
01:38:34,608 --> 01:38:36,246
Now I get it.

1072
01:38:36,443 --> 01:38:38,946
You're here to celebrate your victory.

1073
01:38:40,180 --> 01:38:43,127
I'm happy. But not because I won.

1074
01:38:44,017 --> 01:38:47,362
I'm happy because you still love me.

1075
01:38:49,823 --> 01:38:53,134
My being suspended reflects love?

1076
01:38:53,927 --> 01:38:57,238
Wow! Some logic, Mr. X.

1077
01:38:57,664 --> 01:39:00,474
After Aditya's death, the agency
must have received orders from above.

1078
01:39:01,001 --> 01:39:04,107
Just shoot Mr. X at sight.
Right or wrong?

1079
01:39:04,838 --> 01:39:07,546
Then Bhardwaj must have entrusted
you with this responsibility.

1080
01:39:07,707 --> 01:39:10,483
I'm sure he said "No case,
or proceedings...just kill him".

1081
01:39:10,810 --> 01:39:12,653
That's why you resigned.

1082
01:39:13,079 --> 01:39:14,956
Because you cannot kill me.

1083
01:39:16,416 --> 01:39:18,123
If that's not love, what is it?

1084
01:39:18,385 --> 01:39:19,523
You're right.

1085
01:39:21,121 --> 01:39:22,225
Did you get your answer?

1086
01:39:22,322 --> 01:39:23,733
Now go away.

1087
01:39:43,076 --> 01:39:45,352
Krishna won many wars in Kurukshetra"

1088
01:39:45,845 --> 01:39:47,119
...as well as Radha's heart.

1089
01:39:48,048 --> 01:39:51,791
He's the God of war and love.
And He saved me.

1090
01:39:53,053 --> 01:39:55,226
So this is for you..

1091
01:39:55,722 --> 01:39:57,565
...so that He can protect you.

1092
01:39:58,725 --> 01:40:00,033
What do I do?

1093
01:40:00,927 --> 01:40:02,702
You snatched that right away from me.

1094
01:40:20,647 --> 01:40:21,819
Raghu!

1095
01:40:27,620 --> 01:40:28,860
I love you, Raghu.

1096
01:40:29,022 --> 01:40:30,092
I love you so much.

1097
01:40:30,156 --> 01:40:36,038
"Come, like nights do."

1098
01:40:36,896 --> 01:40:42,744
"Come into my eyes like sleep."

1099
01:40:43,536 --> 01:40:49,714
"Come, like nights do."

1100
01:40:50,210 --> 01:40:55,853
"Come into my eyes like sleep."

1101
01:40:55,915 --> 01:41:02,855
"Evenings meet there only
where we met."

1102
01:41:03,123 --> 01:41:09,335
"Now where are you and how far I am."

1103
01:41:09,429 --> 01:41:16,244
"You are my prayer, my good deeds."

1104
01:41:16,336 --> 01:41:22,116
"O beloved, I thank you so, so much."

1105
01:42:03,016 --> 01:42:08,016
"Through just look I understood,
what all have your eyes said."

1106
01:42:16,162 --> 01:42:21,162
"It seemed as if below my feet,
centuries flowed away."

1107
01:42:29,142 --> 01:42:36,219
"Evenings meet there only
where we met."

1108
01:42:36,316 --> 01:42:42,597
"Now where are you and how far I am."

1109
01:42:42,689 --> 01:42:49,470
"You are my prayer, my good deeds."

1110
01:42:49,662 --> 01:42:55,237
"O beloved, I thank you so, so much."

1111
01:42:55,902 --> 01:43:02,945
"You are my prayer, my good deeds."

1112
01:43:03,009 --> 01:43:08,960
"O beloved, I thank you so, so much."

1113
01:43:23,496 --> 01:43:24,702
Excuse me.

1114
01:43:25,031 --> 01:43:27,068
Table for 2?
- Yeah, sure. This way.

1115
01:43:27,133 --> 01:43:28,373
Come.

1116
01:43:35,808 --> 01:43:37,583
Ma'am.
- Thanks.

1117
01:43:50,890 --> 01:43:51,800
Strange.

1118
01:43:53,159 --> 01:43:55,503
It's lunchtime,
and the entire restaurant is empty.

1119
01:43:55,929 --> 01:43:59,502
This isn't Mumbai.
People come here only on the weekends.

1120
01:45:07,500 --> 01:45:11,573
You said...every1hing
is fair in love and war.

1121
01:45:20,280 --> 01:45:21,953
Just stay the way you are.

1122
01:45:22,615 --> 01:45:24,094
Don't ever change.

1123
01:45:39,966 --> 01:45:41,240
Sorry, Raghu.

1124
01:45:41,834 --> 01:45:47,147
If I hadn't gotten you arrested,
they would've killed you.

1125
01:46:14,600 --> 01:46:16,477
Popo, what happened?

1126
01:46:17,136 --> 01:46:20,811
Forget me, I'm worried about Raghu.

1127
01:46:21,374 --> 01:46:22,876
What do you mean?

1128
01:46:24,110 --> 01:46:28,718
On the day you were suspended
from ATD, that same night.

1129
01:46:41,694 --> 01:46:44,470
So you're the one who helped Mr. X.

1130
01:46:47,233 --> 01:46:49,213
I was wondering..

1131
01:46:49,268 --> 01:46:52,078
...how could Lanka burn
without Vibhishan's help?

1132
01:46:54,006 --> 01:46:55,485
Where is Raghu?

1133
01:46:56,642 --> 01:46:58,053
Look, Popo.

1134
01:46:58,144 --> 01:47:00,181
Either you stay quiet
and land up in jail.

1135
01:47:00,446 --> 01:47:02,892
Or tell me and get promoted.

1136
01:47:04,951 --> 01:47:06,794
You're going to tell
me one way or the other.

1137
01:47:07,754 --> 01:47:10,928
In what condition is your choice.

1138
01:47:19,031 --> 01:47:20,169
Popo.

1139
01:47:27,407 --> 01:47:31,685
That third man,
who conspired to kill the CM..

1140
01:47:32,345 --> 01:47:33,881
...is their main man.

1141
01:47:34,614 --> 01:47:36,685
ATD's boss, Bhardwaj.

1142
01:47:46,926 --> 01:47:49,338
Siya, you here?
- I need your help.

1143
01:47:50,530 --> 01:47:51,508
What's wrong?

1144
01:48:10,149 --> 01:48:12,959
Your girlfriend thought
I was a fool like her.

1145
01:48:13,786 --> 01:48:17,996
She thought I would arrest
you and present you in the court.

1146
01:48:19,058 --> 01:48:21,038
But you know I'm
just going to kill you.

1147
01:48:21,594 --> 01:48:24,074
And then I'll be the hero..

1148
01:48:24,130 --> 01:48:27,543
...who killed Tiwari
and the CM's murderer.

1149
01:48:27,867 --> 01:48:30,438
We just need to elaborate this story.

1150
01:48:31,137 --> 01:48:34,118
So what happened was
that you tried to escape.

1151
01:48:34,340 --> 01:48:35,978
I caught you.

1152
01:48:36,075 --> 01:48:39,579
You pounced on me.
Snatched my gun..

1153
01:48:40,112 --> 01:48:41,591
...and killed Amar.

1154
01:48:44,383 --> 01:48:49,059
Next you ran into that building,
and I chased you.

1155
01:48:49,355 --> 01:48:51,665
You took the elevator up.

1156
01:48:51,724 --> 01:48:56,696
And I followed you to the
terrace in the other elevator.

1157
01:49:01,267 --> 01:49:04,373
The biggest advantage
of killing an invisible man..

1158
01:49:04,470 --> 01:49:07,474
...is that you don't actually
need him to fake his death.

1159
01:49:09,575 --> 01:49:11,782
This CCTV isn't working today.

1160
01:49:12,712 --> 01:49:14,089
It was yesterday.

1161
01:49:14,146 --> 01:49:17,025
I came here and pretended
to fight with Mr. X.

1162
01:49:17,517 --> 01:49:20,054
And then I threw him down
and put an end to this charade.

1163
01:49:20,987 --> 01:49:22,728
Now I just need to throw you down.

1164
01:49:24,457 --> 01:49:26,698
You can see
Mr. X after he's dead, right?

1165
01:49:30,897 --> 01:49:32,399
Move back!

1166
01:49:38,905 --> 01:49:40,179
Move back!

1167
01:50:21,981 --> 01:50:22,891
Raghu!

1168
01:54:25,758 --> 01:54:27,066
Raghu!

1169
01:54:27,927 --> 01:54:29,372
Raghu, leave him.

1170
01:54:29,662 --> 01:54:31,005
I said leave him.

1171
01:54:31,664 --> 01:54:32,938
Raghu, let him go.

1172
01:54:32,998 --> 01:54:35,069
Let him go or I will shoot.

1173
01:54:40,973 --> 01:54:45,149
Raghu, if you don't let
him go then I will kill myself.

1174
01:54:47,947 --> 01:54:51,759
I will do it, Raghu.
Believe me I will do it.

1175
01:54:53,752 --> 01:54:55,629
Let him go.

1176
01:55:09,902 --> 01:55:10,903
Raghu.

1177
01:55:12,638 --> 01:55:13,616
Raghu.

1178
01:55:15,941 --> 01:55:16,942
Raghu.

1179
01:55:17,309 --> 01:55:18,447
Raghu, stop.

1180
01:55:19,044 --> 01:55:21,081
Are you okay?

1181
01:55:21,714 --> 01:55:22,522
Just breathe.

1182
01:55:22,615 --> 01:55:25,255
Sir. We need to take
him to a hospital right now.

1183
01:55:25,885 --> 01:55:27,387
Sir. Are you..
- Get off.

1184
01:55:29,855 --> 01:55:31,698
Sir, we need to keep
you in a safe place..

1185
01:55:31,790 --> 01:55:33,394
...where Raghu can't get to you.

1186
01:55:33,492 --> 01:55:36,439
I am not a rat to go hide in a burrow.

1187
01:55:37,229 --> 01:55:39,004
I am not going anywhere.

1188
01:55:39,064 --> 01:55:43,137
I will kill that rascal.
- Sir, please try to understand.

1189
01:55:43,769 --> 01:55:46,978
You've seen him.
He's bloodthirsty.

1190
01:55:47,206 --> 01:55:49,584
He won't stop until
he gets his revenge.

1191
01:55:51,243 --> 01:55:55,658
Revenge?
- Yes, sir.

1192
01:55:56,649 --> 01:55:59,027
I know you were the
third and the last man..

1193
01:55:59,118 --> 01:56:00,825
...who was involved in that plan.

1194
01:56:01,186 --> 01:56:03,666
But it's not my
responsibility to kill you.

1195
01:56:03,856 --> 01:56:05,802
I have to save you.

1196
01:56:08,327 --> 01:56:12,605
Anyway, we can't see Raghu,
so escaping him is impossible.

1197
01:56:13,666 --> 01:56:16,909
It'll be easier if you admit
to your crimes and surrender.

1198
01:56:16,969 --> 01:56:18,312
And get arrested.

1199
01:56:18,404 --> 01:56:19,974
Are you mad?

1200
01:56:20,606 --> 01:56:26,079
If I admit to killing that
stupid CM Dwarkanath Dutta..

1201
01:56:26,178 --> 01:56:29,159
...then the Law will
hang me like Kasab.

1202
01:56:32,751 --> 01:56:34,492
Tiwari and Aditya are dead.

1203
01:56:35,387 --> 01:56:38,561
You want me to admit to all
their crimes and be the scapegoat.

1204
01:56:40,626 --> 01:56:42,833
Go behind bars to escape death?

1205
01:56:43,495 --> 01:56:44,838
What do you think?

1206
01:56:45,097 --> 01:56:48,476
If I admit to my crimes,
get arrested they'll spare me?

1207
01:56:51,470 --> 01:56:53,108
There's one way to solve this dilemma.

1208
01:56:53,572 --> 01:56:54,448
You see...

1209
01:56:55,007 --> 01:56:56,850
There's no point in killing Mr. X.

1210
01:56:57,343 --> 01:56:59,289
Because he has public support.

1211
01:57:00,679 --> 01:57:03,421
We need to turn them against him.

1212
01:57:04,450 --> 01:57:08,489
We'll disclose that Raghu
didn't die after killing the CM.

1213
01:57:08,754 --> 01:57:11,564
In fact, he's Aditya
and Tiwari's murderer Mr. X.

1214
01:57:11,790 --> 01:57:13,929
And then this hero
will be seen as a villain.

1215
01:57:14,727 --> 01:57:18,675
We'll reveal that
Mr. X can be seen in sunlight.

1216
01:57:18,964 --> 01:57:21,843
This will restrict his movements.

1217
01:57:22,868 --> 01:57:23,778
He'll be trapped.

1218
01:57:23,836 --> 01:57:25,543
And then we'll kill him.
- Yes!

1219
01:57:25,838 --> 01:57:27,146
That's what we'll do.

1220
01:57:27,239 --> 01:57:28,650
You call a press conference.

1221
01:57:28,707 --> 01:57:30,209
You call a press conference.

1222
01:57:31,810 --> 01:57:38,159
We've called you to share
new information with you.

1223
01:57:38,884 --> 01:57:42,889
The truth about Mr. X.

1224
01:57:43,155 --> 01:57:49,333
Before that, we'll show
you a clip of our CM being shot.

1225
01:57:51,730 --> 01:57:53,209
'Are you mad?'

1226
01:57:54,199 --> 01:57:58,739
'If I admit to killing that
stupid CM Dwarkanath Dutta..'

1227
01:57:58,804 --> 01:58:02,115
'..then the Law will
hang me like Kasab.'

1228
01:58:03,776 --> 01:58:05,653
'Tiwari and Aditya are dead.'

1229
01:58:06,211 --> 01:58:09,192
'You want me to admit to all
their crimes and be the scapegoat.'

1230
01:58:10,816 --> 01:58:12,989
'Go behind bars to escape death?'

1231
01:58:13,685 --> 01:58:14,823
<i>' Raghu.'</i>

1232
01:58:15,187 --> 01:58:16,632
'Raghu, please stop.'

1233
01:58:16,688 --> 01:58:18,793
'Raghu, please...just stop.'

1234
01:58:26,031 --> 01:58:30,309
'Proving you're innocent is
more important than killing Bhardwaj.'

1235
01:58:31,170 --> 01:58:32,240
'Please, Raghu.'

1236
01:58:36,809 --> 01:58:37,787
'What do you think?'

1237
01:58:37,843 --> 01:58:41,313
'If I admit to my crimes,
get arrested they'll spare me?'

1238
01:58:41,413 --> 01:58:44,485
'You want me to admit to all
their crimes and be the scapegoat.'

1239
01:58:44,817 --> 01:58:47,229
'Go behind bars to escape death?'

1240
01:58:47,719 --> 01:58:49,027
'What do you think?'

1241
01:58:54,026 --> 01:58:56,063
Sir, is it true that
you killed the Chief Minister?

1242
01:58:56,261 --> 01:58:57,934
Were you lying to us?

1243
01:58:58,030 --> 01:59:00,067
You killed Aditya as well.

1244
01:59:00,165 --> 01:59:01,439
You killed Tiwari too.

1245
01:59:01,533 --> 01:59:03,877
This is nonsense, this tape is a fake.

1246
01:59:03,936 --> 01:59:06,246
This is someone else,
it's not my voice.

1247
01:59:06,338 --> 01:59:08,443
It's nonsense.
I didn't say anything.

1248
01:59:08,540 --> 01:59:09,848
Please just calm down.

1249
01:59:09,908 --> 01:59:12,479
This is a conspiracy
for trying to trap me.

1250
01:59:12,578 --> 01:59:14,524
She did it.
This is all her doing.

1251
01:59:14,580 --> 01:59:16,150
She joined hands with
Raghu from the beginning.

1252
01:59:16,215 --> 01:59:20,095
She wants to trap me.
Please. Please, just listen to me.

1253
02:00:06,331 --> 02:00:07,571
Drop your guns.

1254
02:00:09,001 --> 02:00:10,071
Drop them.

1255
02:00:10,569 --> 02:00:11,639
Drop them.

1256
02:00:12,838 --> 02:00:13,873
Move!

1257
02:00:18,477 --> 02:00:20,252
Raghu, drop your gun.

1258
02:00:20,412 --> 02:00:22,756
Raghu...l will kill her.

1259
02:00:27,286 --> 02:00:28,856
I will kill her, Raghu.

1260
02:00:29,121 --> 02:00:30,429
Throw down your gun.

1261
02:00:34,326 --> 02:00:35,669
Come on, Raghu.

1262
02:00:35,928 --> 02:00:37,202
Come on, shoot me.

1263
02:00:37,262 --> 02:00:38,366
Come on.

1264
02:01:03,989 --> 02:01:06,196
I am not a traitor,
whose last resort is crime.

1265
02:01:07,326 --> 02:01:11,103
I am a helpless man,
who has no ray of hope.

1266
02:01:13,298 --> 02:01:17,371
I am not the Raghuram Rathod who'll be
bound by law and tolerate injustice.

1267
02:01:17,970 --> 02:01:21,747
I am Mr. X...who will break
the law and protect justice.

1268
02:02:16,395 --> 02:02:22,744
I was wondering... do the
invisible need to take a shower.

1269
02:02:23,101 --> 02:02:27,675
Those who are invisible,
just need love.

1270
02:02:35,180 --> 02:02:36,591
So what are your intentions?

1271
02:02:37,182 --> 02:02:38,354
Not good at all.

1272
02:02:52,831 --> 02:02:56,074
"There are no imprints
of your footsteps."

1273
02:02:56,368 --> 02:02:59,838
"There is no heat in your fire."

1274
02:02:59,938 --> 02:03:03,249
"There is no emotions for your words."

1275
02:03:03,442 --> 02:03:07,618
"You are here, and still not here."

1276
02:03:07,913 --> 02:03:11,417
"You are the soul without body."

1277
02:03:11,483 --> 02:03:14,692
"You are the ash,
you are nothing."

1278
02:03:14,986 --> 02:03:18,524
"You are the soul without body."

1279
02:03:18,623 --> 02:03:24,539
"Who are you,
what's your name, tell me."

1280
02:03:25,597 --> 02:03:27,304
"You can call me X."

1281
02:03:29,201 --> 02:03:30,942
"You can call me X."

1282
02:03:32,671 --> 02:03:34,275
"You can call me X."

1283
02:03:36,141 --> 02:03:37,552
"Mr. X!"

1284
02:03:39,811 --> 02:03:41,415
"You can call me X."

1285
02:03:41,513 --> 02:03:43,288
"You can call him X."

1286
02:03:43,348 --> 02:03:45,021
"You can call me X."

1287
02:03:45,117 --> 02:03:46,824
"You can call him X."

1288
02:03:46,885 --> 02:03:48,694
"You can call me X."

1289
02:03:48,754 --> 02:03:50,392
"You can call him X."

1290
02:03:50,455 --> 02:03:51,798
"Mr. X!"

1291
02:04:09,174 --> 02:04:12,451
"Your fragrance pulls me."

1292
02:04:12,677 --> 02:04:16,147
"Your breaths heat up my body."

1293
02:04:16,214 --> 02:04:19,787
"Your heartbeat only I have heard."

1294
02:04:19,885 --> 02:04:24,061
"There is not even a shadow of yours."

1295
02:04:24,256 --> 02:04:30,901
"O unseen friend,
what kind of secret you are?"

1296
02:04:31,363 --> 02:04:34,833
"O unseen friend.."

1297
02:04:34,933 --> 02:04:41,543
"..who are you,
what's your name, tell me."

1298
02:04:42,007 --> 02:04:43,714
"You can call me X."

1299
02:04:43,775 --> 02:04:45,379
"You can call him X."

1300
02:04:45,444 --> 02:04:47,219
"You can call me X."

1301
02:04:47,279 --> 02:04:49,088
"You can call him X."

1302
02:04:49,147 --> 02:04:50,854
"You can call me X."

1303
02:04:50,949 --> 02:04:52,587
"You can call him X."

1304
02:04:52,651 --> 02:04:53,959
"Mr. X!"

1305
02:04:56,254 --> 02:04:58,256
"Mr. X moves!"
