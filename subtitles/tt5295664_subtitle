1
00:01:31,833 --> 00:01:34,671
Even I do not know
why this entire family..

2
00:01:34,751 --> 00:01:38,223
..running in a bright
sunny day of winter.

3
00:01:38,303 --> 00:01:39,970
Come on let us know the reason.

4
00:01:44,088 --> 00:01:46,743
Hurry up. Run faster.

5
00:01:51,356 --> 00:01:53,708
- Wait..
- Hurry up, hurry up..

6
00:01:53,788 --> 00:01:56,865
Inspector sir,
please save us from him.

7
00:01:56,945 --> 00:01:57,876
Arrest him, sir.

8
00:01:57,956 --> 00:01:59,329
- From whom should we save you?
- Somehow arrest him.

9
00:01:59,409 --> 00:02:00,938
- Who should I arrest?
- Him.

10
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:02,562
That constable?

11
00:02:02,642 --> 00:02:04,119
Not him but the other one.

12
00:02:04,199 --> 00:02:05,406
He must be having some name.

13
00:02:05,486 --> 00:02:08,378
He is innocent looking but
is not less than an atom bomb.

14
00:02:08,458 --> 00:02:10,087
- Is he a terrorist?
- He is dangerous than them also.

15
00:02:10,167 --> 00:02:11,264
After arresting him
prison him for life.

16
00:02:11,344 --> 00:02:12,680
Not life imprisonment, but hang him.

17
00:02:12,076 --> 00:02:13,178
Do his encounter, sir.

18
00:02:13,942 --> 00:02:15,008
Do something quickly, sir.

19
00:02:15,071 --> 00:02:18,325
Don't try to give me order
otherwise I will put you behind bars.

20
00:02:19,044 --> 00:02:22,045
I shall hang you.
And will do your encounter.

21
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:24,294
- Now tell me who is he?
- He is my nephew.

22
00:02:24,051 --> 00:02:25,478
He is son of my brother-in-law.

23
00:02:26,017 --> 00:02:27,201
He is our friend, sir.

24
00:02:27,281 --> 00:02:29,007
- He is our brother, sir.
- I understood.

25
00:02:29,087 --> 00:02:30,489
Now tell me what has he done?

26
00:02:42,867 --> 00:02:44,975
So Kaajal,
why are you marrying so soon?

27
00:02:45,055 --> 00:02:47,074
Because with great difficulty
I have found a rich man.

28
00:02:47,325 --> 00:02:49,526
I am really excited to see your groom.

29
00:02:49,606 --> 00:02:51,028
Does he resemble Hrithik?

30
00:02:51,108 --> 00:02:53,785
- He is just a little short in height.
- Is he handsome?

31
00:02:53,865 --> 00:02:56,542
Of course he has to be handsome
as he is going to be my husband.

32
00:02:56,622 --> 00:02:58,466
I feel like seeing him immediately.

33
00:02:58,546 --> 00:02:59,572
Then go and see him.

34
00:03:01,878 --> 00:03:12,299
'English rap song'

35
00:03:12,379 --> 00:03:15,336
Great Kaajal,
brother-in-law is very dashing.

36
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:17,949
He is just like film star.
Your life is set.

37
00:03:18,029 --> 00:03:19,454
If I would have got such
a husband then I would..

38
00:03:19,534 --> 00:03:21,285
have gone from canopy
straight for honeymoon.

39
00:03:21,365 --> 00:03:22,748
He must be someone else.

40
00:03:22,828 --> 00:03:25,415
The groom is getting
ready in the room downstairs.

41
00:03:25,495 --> 00:03:26,654
Go and see him there.

42
00:03:28,508 --> 00:03:29,684
Dear brother-in-law.

43
00:03:38,934 --> 00:03:41,019
Look at his legs.
They look like pillar of metro train.

44
00:03:43,334 --> 00:03:46,440
The ornament on his forehead
seems like horns of the donkey.

45
00:03:47,043 --> 00:03:50,060
If we make a bear wear this
dress then even it will look better.

46
00:03:50,527 --> 00:03:51,612
He does not seem to be
groom but grandfather of a groom.

47
00:03:52,457 --> 00:03:54,514
No evil eye should
fall on this sweet guy.

48
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:56,306
- Are you ready?
- Tell me one thing.

49
00:03:56,386 --> 00:03:57,662
What are people gossiping outside?

50
00:03:57,742 --> 00:03:58,818
Shall I spread the rumor
that this is your third marriage?

51
00:03:59,582 --> 00:04:01,515
The first one ran
away because you are old.

52
00:04:02,153 --> 00:04:05,228
Look at my soft skin.
Don't I look like sweet 27?

53
00:04:05,983 --> 00:04:07,489
I know but others
feel it is not marriage..

54
00:04:07,569 --> 00:04:08,604
..but celebrations of
50thmarriage anniversary.

55
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:11,920
Can't people see that
it is clearly written..

56
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,827
..on card and on the board outside?

57
00:04:14,907 --> 00:04:17,841
Grandfather, how much time
is left for marriage to take place?

58
00:04:17,921 --> 00:04:19,089
I am feeling sleepy.

59
00:04:19,169 --> 00:04:20,744
Have you invited uneducated people?

60
00:04:20,824 --> 00:04:22,290
Announce my age in
the speaker outside.

61
00:04:22,037 --> 00:04:24,742
Brother, do you remember that
I sat along with you on the horse..

62
00:04:25,155 --> 00:04:27,189
..when you were getting
married for the first time?

63
00:04:27,269 --> 00:04:28,593
And the bride ran away.

64
00:04:28,673 --> 00:04:29,739
When you tried to get
married for second time..

65
00:04:30,413 --> 00:04:32,018
..then my son sat
with you on the horse.

66
00:04:32,098 --> 00:04:33,444
Even that bride escaped.

67
00:04:33,524 --> 00:04:36,356
This is your third try. This time
my grandson sat with you on the horse.

68
00:04:36,436 --> 00:04:38,501
Brother, I am scared that even
this time the bride might escape.

69
00:04:38,581 --> 00:04:41,213
On such an auspicious occasion
why are telling me incidents of past.

70
00:04:41,293 --> 00:04:43,849
Give him 1-2 lollipops in his
mouth and h will keep sucking them.

71
00:04:43,929 --> 00:04:45,142
- Who is groom's mother here?
- I am the one.

72
00:04:45,222 --> 00:04:46,648
There is so much tension
going on in the kitchen..

73
00:04:46,728 --> 00:04:47,743
..and you are gossiping here.

74
00:04:47,823 --> 00:04:49,639
- Come on mother.
- Who is he?

75
00:04:49,719 --> 00:04:50,234
He took her away.

76
00:04:50,314 --> 00:04:51,506
He took away my wife
calling her mother.

77
00:04:51,586 --> 00:04:53,783
- He is my nephew.
- He is son of my brother-in-law.

78
00:04:53,863 --> 00:04:54,959
He is our friend, sir.

79
00:04:55,118 --> 00:04:56,135
He is our brother.

80
00:04:58,046 --> 00:04:59,554
I am feeling shy.

81
00:04:59,634 --> 00:05:01,187
I am feeling shy.

82
00:05:04,356 --> 00:05:05,622
Handle with care uncle.

83
00:05:05,702 --> 00:05:08,957
She is not just a bride but the
heartbeat of Tarun's king size heart.

84
00:05:09,037 --> 00:05:11,961
Who is this super hero
who saved my darling?

85
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:14,140
- He is my nephew.
- He is son of my brother-in-law.

86
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:15,983
- He is our friend.
- He is our brother, sir.

87
00:05:18,095 --> 00:05:21,793
Excuse me. Are you from the
bride's side or the groom's side?

88
00:05:21,873 --> 00:05:24,159
I do not know that but
you are a great human being.

89
00:05:24,239 --> 00:05:25,183
Who are you?

90
00:05:25,263 --> 00:05:27,045
- I am member of 'Make a wish'
- What?

91
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:28,458
You must have read in
the newspaper that a cancer..

92
00:05:28,538 --> 00:05:30,019
..patient wants to
meet the Prime minister.

93
00:05:30,099 --> 00:05:30,925
I arranged the meeting.

94
00:05:31,005 --> 00:05:33,700
A child wanted to play an
over with Sachin so I made him play.

95
00:05:33,078 --> 00:05:34,127
I have no such wish.

96
00:05:35,035 --> 00:05:36,878
Why? Isn't it your
wish to get married?

97
00:05:37,273 --> 00:05:39,278
It is my responsibility to get
unfortunate people like you married.

98
00:05:41,032 --> 00:05:43,627
Responsibility should not
be taken on shoulders but on head.

99
00:05:43,707 --> 00:05:45,536
- What are you wearing?
- Two piece for the wedding.

100
00:05:45,616 --> 00:05:48,165
I have kept modern dress
for grooms inside of 21 years.

101
00:05:48,245 --> 00:05:49,252
Hurry up brother, the auspicious..

102
00:05:49,395 --> 00:05:51,333
- ..moment is passing away.
- Keep quiet. Hold this.

103
00:05:51,413 --> 00:05:52,956
- I will just go and become
a modern groom. - Good boy.

104
00:05:53,036 --> 00:05:54,188
- Come on let's go.
- Come.

105
00:05:54,693 --> 00:05:57,461
Hold this.
Will I look handsome wearing that?

106
00:05:57,541 --> 00:05:58,637
The friends of the bride will woo you.

107
00:05:58,717 --> 00:06:00,356
Now I will wear clothes
of latest fashion and the..

108
00:06:00,436 --> 00:06:01,992
..bride will become
unconscious on seeing me.

109
00:06:02,072 --> 00:06:03,494
Hurry up.
The auspicious time is passing away.

110
00:06:07,362 --> 00:06:09,521
Hey, I cannot see the dress anywhere.

111
00:06:09,846 --> 00:06:11,780
Oh God, the auspicious
time has passed.

112
00:06:11,086 --> 00:06:12,055
- Varun, brother.
- Yes.

113
00:06:12,909 --> 00:06:15,638
- I think he has locked me from out.
- I will just open it.

114
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:18,852
He said that if I wear
clothes of latest fashion..

115
00:06:18,932 --> 00:06:20,501
..then the bride
will keep staring at me.

116
00:06:20,581 --> 00:06:21,887
Your bride ran away.

117
00:06:25,104 --> 00:06:26,315
He fooled me.

118
00:06:26,395 --> 00:06:28,847
He was saying that girl will become
unconscious on seeing me in the dress.

119
00:06:28,927 --> 00:06:30,099
He eloped with the girl.

120
00:06:30,179 --> 00:06:32,822
Just see if he has
some relatives here.

121
00:06:32,902 --> 00:06:35,095
We will take them to police station.

122
00:06:38,506 --> 00:06:41,114
Did you hear our story?
He really troubles us.

123
00:06:41,194 --> 00:06:44,089
We tolerate him because
he is blood relation, sir.

124
00:06:44,169 --> 00:06:45,791
Who said there is no relation?

125
00:06:45,871 --> 00:06:48,877
To increase your general knowledge do
you want to know, who that groom is.

126
00:06:48,957 --> 00:06:51,853
- Who?
- He is my uncle.

127
00:06:52,947 --> 00:06:54,420
Now tell me where is he?

128
00:06:54,005 --> 00:06:57,211
If he was a doctor then we would have
gone to some hospital to find him.

129
00:06:57,786 --> 00:06:59,629
If h was a lawyer then we would
have gone to some court to find him.

130
00:06:59,709 --> 00:07:02,864
But he is jobless, fearless,
senseless, careless, reckless..

131
00:07:02,944 --> 00:07:05,310
..and ridiculous and in
short he is totally useless.

132
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:07,448
Now you tell me where shall
we find such a useless person.

133
00:07:15,275 --> 00:07:22,834
'English rap song'

134
00:07:24,876 --> 00:07:26,530
Hey, go away from here.

135
00:07:26,061 --> 00:07:28,880
Now our brother is
going to play cricket here. Go away.

136
00:07:29,509 --> 00:07:30,545
Start the game.

137
00:07:39,878 --> 00:07:41,587
Hey, when will their cricket get over?

138
00:07:41,829 --> 00:07:44,852
- Uncle, move. We are getting late.
- Wait, I will move.

139
00:07:45,139 --> 00:07:47,274
Hey, don't you have any sense?

140
00:07:47,354 --> 00:07:49,052
Is cricket played
on road or in playground?

141
00:07:49,132 --> 00:07:50,844
Someone has to go to office
and someone has to go to school.

142
00:08:02,566 --> 00:08:04,660
My daughter fell from the terrace.
Please let the ambulance go.

143
00:08:05,586 --> 00:08:06,884
Please..

144
00:08:11,181 --> 00:08:12,800
It is an emergency. Please let us go.

145
00:08:12,088 --> 00:08:13,392
Go away..

146
00:08:15,546 --> 00:08:16,611
You..

147
00:10:03,723 --> 00:10:04,509
Greetings, brother.

148
00:10:04,589 --> 00:10:06,441
- Did you find about that rascal?
- Not yet.

149
00:10:06,521 --> 00:10:07,687
My men are finding him.

150
00:10:07,767 --> 00:10:08,855
How is my son?

151
00:10:08,935 --> 00:10:09,928
His neck has become stiff.

152
00:10:10,008 --> 00:10:10,870
- Sir..
- What is it?

153
00:10:10,095 --> 00:10:11,179
Sir, your son will
take medicine only when..

154
00:10:12,114 --> 00:10:13,670
..the one who thrashed him is found.

155
00:10:16,298 --> 00:10:17,831
Arjun, look I have come.

156
00:10:17,911 --> 00:10:22,635
I burnt that rascal alive and
put his ashes in the gutter. Tell me.

157
00:10:22,715 --> 00:10:24,156
Yes sir, we killed him.

158
00:10:25,617 --> 00:10:28,611
Doctor, bring the medicines. Quick.
Now my son..

159
00:10:30,016 --> 00:10:31,018
Give water.

160
00:10:31,305 --> 00:10:33,472
Have it.

161
00:10:33,552 --> 00:10:36,168
Sir, the person who thrashed
our younger brother..

162
00:10:36,248 --> 00:10:37,329
..is singing a song with
the girl in hanging garden.

163
00:10:39,292 --> 00:10:39,945
Idiot..

164
00:10:45,087 --> 00:10:48,325
Stupid, foolish..couldn't
you remain quiet for some time?

165
00:10:52,378 --> 00:10:54,791
Arjun, give me one day's time.

166
00:10:54,871 --> 00:10:57,442
I will bring him here
and kill him in front of you.

167
00:10:57,593 --> 00:10:59,600
I will chop him into pieces.

168
00:11:00,035 --> 00:11:02,061
Please listen to your
father and eat medicine.

169
00:11:02,456 --> 00:11:03,261
Why are you standing?
Give the medicine.

170
00:11:03,341 --> 00:11:04,269
Give the medicine.

171
00:11:06,471 --> 00:11:08,685
Sir, he is the father of the boy
Mr. Krishnarao.

172
00:11:08,765 --> 00:11:08,830
Greetings.

173
00:11:09,942 --> 00:11:11,956
- And she is his wife Sujata.
- Greetings.

174
00:11:12,036 --> 00:11:13,860
They are boy's uncle and
aunt and their two daughters.

175
00:11:13,094 --> 00:11:14,147
- Greetings.
- He is Raja Rao.

176
00:11:15,055 --> 00:11:16,758
Chairman of Sumitra
group of industries.

177
00:11:17,557 --> 00:11:19,135
This family is full of values.

178
00:11:19,215 --> 00:11:21,548
Their family has nothing
to do with violence.

179
00:11:25,075 --> 00:11:26,259
- Greetings, son.
- Greetings.

180
00:11:29,901 --> 00:11:30,809
Uncle, who were they?

181
00:11:30,889 --> 00:11:32,165
They had come to talk about marriage?

182
00:11:32,245 --> 00:11:33,128
About your marriage?

183
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:34,717
Who will marry me in this age?

184
00:11:35,017 --> 00:11:37,043
Don't you have sense?
About your marriage..

185
00:11:37,276 --> 00:11:39,338
My marriage? Without asking me.

186
00:11:39,466 --> 00:11:44,303
We are not forcing you. If you do
not like the girl then you can refuse.

187
00:11:45,055 --> 00:11:46,131
What is wrong is seeing the girl?

188
00:11:47,043 --> 00:11:49,949
We really liked the girl.
We showed your photograph to them.

189
00:11:50,029 --> 00:11:51,682
They are ready for this relationship.

190
00:11:52,119 --> 00:11:53,226
This proposal is not acceptable to me.

191
00:11:53,306 --> 00:11:55,800
Is this proposal not acceptable to
you or you don't want to get married?

192
00:11:56,138 --> 00:11:59,196
What is this nonsense? Listen to
what we are saying. Forget that girl.

193
00:12:00,504 --> 00:12:01,661
It is not easy to forget.

194
00:12:02,526 --> 00:12:03,650
You make him understand.

195
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:06,756
Hey, your father has given you
much more time than it was required.

196
00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:09,373
It has already been three months.
Now you will have to listen to them.

197
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:12,714
Yes son, she is a girl with values.

198
00:12:13,571 --> 00:12:15,142
She will keep you happy.

199
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:18,476
You will get the same answer
as many times as you ask the question.

200
00:12:18,556 --> 00:12:19,528
I cannot get married.

201
00:12:19,608 --> 00:12:22,051
While I am alive I think
I will not see him getting married..

202
00:12:22,362 --> 00:12:25,255
..but he will surely
see me dying one day.

203
00:12:28,167 --> 00:12:28,818
Siddharth..

204
00:12:29,157 --> 00:12:32,796
You must have realized that
he does not want to get married.

205
00:12:32,948 --> 00:12:37,224
But to know this we
will go three months behind.

206
00:12:48,157 --> 00:12:49,212
Who is sitting next to me?

207
00:12:50,046 --> 00:12:52,481
Mayor, Mr. Gole, Mr. Verma..

208
00:12:52,828 --> 00:12:55,464
Saileja, age 24.

209
00:12:55,544 --> 00:12:58,923
Opposite seat. I think the
long journey will pass easily. Superb.

210
00:12:59,367 --> 00:13:01,096
Mr. Gole, how are you?

211
00:13:01,176 --> 00:13:02,972
What is this sir?
How did you come to know my name?

212
00:13:03,052 --> 00:13:05,387
Don't think too much. I read your
name on the list which is put outside.

213
00:13:15,025 --> 00:13:18,046
What is this sir? You cleaned
that seat and sprayed perfume.

214
00:13:18,374 --> 00:13:19,827
And you sat on the opposite seat.

215
00:13:19,907 --> 00:13:22,408
Saileja, young girl..

216
00:13:22,488 --> 00:13:23,571
You seem to be in great mood.

217
00:13:23,651 --> 00:13:24,934
Is she your girlfriend?

218
00:13:25,239 --> 00:13:28,144
Stupid, first we will
look into each other's eyes.

219
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:29,750
Then by conversation
the matter will move ahead.

220
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:30,581
After that love,
marriage and honeymoon.

221
00:13:31,408 --> 00:13:32,150
After that?

222
00:13:32,096 --> 00:13:33,148
She will become a mother.

223
00:13:35,133 --> 00:13:37,176
Hurry up, dear. We have got late.

224
00:13:37,256 --> 00:13:38,701
I had told you earlier
that after the government has..

225
00:13:38,781 --> 00:13:40,275
..changed the trains
have started leaving on time.

226
00:13:40,355 --> 00:13:42,224
- Forgive me.
- What is this?

227
00:13:42,304 --> 00:13:45,983
Why are you making flyover with your
legs to move from one seat to another?

228
00:13:46,063 --> 00:13:48,018
Get aside.
Get a side.

229
00:13:48,098 --> 00:13:48,173
- Listen, brother..
- What happened?

230
00:13:48,928 --> 00:13:50,580
- Have you seen my wife?
- The one who was wearing read Sari?

231
00:13:50,846 --> 00:13:52,374
- She was on platform number 2.
- No.

232
00:13:52,454 --> 00:13:55,103
You do not know anything. I had
seen her with Gangu sweetmeat seller.

233
00:13:55,183 --> 00:13:56,237
Till now she must have eloped.

234
00:13:56,317 --> 00:13:57,876
She must have eloped?
This is great news.

235
00:13:57,956 --> 00:13:58,733
- I will go immediately.
- Clear the crowd.

236
00:13:58,813 --> 00:14:00,670
Tell him that how hot looking he was.

237
00:14:00,075 --> 00:14:02,093
You go and tell her if
you are being so concerned.

238
00:14:02,848 --> 00:14:04,039
Marry him if you find him so hot.

239
00:14:04,119 --> 00:14:06,550
Have I opened a railway enquiry
office that I will tell him?

240
00:14:08,923 --> 00:14:09,795
- Hey..
- Yes.

241
00:14:10,111 --> 00:14:11,139
- What if it would have hit?
- Whom?

242
00:14:11,471 --> 00:14:13,158
- You threw the bag on the girl.
- Where is she?

243
00:14:13,587 --> 00:14:15,185
- Where is the girl?
- She is about to come.

244
00:14:15,265 --> 00:14:18,486
- He has just cleaned that seat.
- Great.

245
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:19,575
And what will happen after she comes.

246
00:14:19,655 --> 00:14:23,323
First their eyes will meet
and then the matter will move ahead.

247
00:14:23,403 --> 00:14:25,640
And then love, marriage
and honeymoon will take place.

248
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:25,799
Now tell him about
her becoming a mother.

249
00:14:26,527 --> 00:14:28,068
Then she will become
mother of his child.

250
00:14:28,148 --> 00:14:29,959
Stupid, that girl has
still not come and you all..

251
00:14:30,039 --> 00:14:31,617
..are thinking about
her becoming mother.

252
00:14:31,697 --> 00:14:32,846
Let the girl come.

253
00:14:32,926 --> 00:14:34,833
I have kept the bag
so we will sit here.

254
00:14:34,913 --> 00:14:35,857
Do whatever you want to.

255
00:14:36,102 --> 00:14:38,150
Hey, I want the seat
vacant once she comes.

256
00:14:38,023 --> 00:14:40,006
Otherwise you will
not be able to stand.

257
00:14:40,293 --> 00:14:41,188
Now everything will happen
once the station comes.

258
00:14:41,268 --> 00:14:41,941
Hey, go away.

259
00:14:42,021 --> 00:14:45,356
Listen, he is talking so
respectfully then please get up.

260
00:14:45,511 --> 00:14:48,510
Stupid, you are asking me to get up.
You are supporting this boy.

261
00:14:48,059 --> 00:14:49,562
Tell me, what relation
do you have with him.

262
00:14:50,592 --> 00:14:52,125
If you like him so
much then go and hug him.

263
00:14:52,252 --> 00:14:55,457
- Please listen to him.
- Is she your wife or mine?

264
00:14:55,668 --> 00:14:57,295
- Did you fall in love with her at
first sight? - Speak something nice.

265
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:59,420
Even I have a family.
She is just like my sister.

266
00:14:59,005 --> 00:15:00,044
From where did family
come into picture?

267
00:15:00,619 --> 00:15:03,167
My wife is your sister then
your wife is my sister as well.

268
00:15:03,247 --> 00:15:05,658
Oh God..
Good that I did not get my wife along.

269
00:15:05,843 --> 00:15:07,127
Come on take out my Lungi.

270
00:15:10,232 --> 00:15:13,509
Hello, yes father we
all are coming by train.

271
00:15:13,589 --> 00:15:15,997
If you had saved some money
then we would have come at plane.

272
00:15:16,077 --> 00:15:18,864
You do not know how difficult
it is to change clothes in plane.

273
00:15:19,269 --> 00:15:20,658
What is this, brother?

274
00:15:20,738 --> 00:15:22,546
It is underwear. Wipe your face.

275
00:15:22,626 --> 00:15:25,552
Father, I am not saying it to you.
A stupid fellow is sitting here too.

276
00:15:25,084 --> 00:15:25,948
Keep the phone.

277
00:15:46,941 --> 00:15:51,783
Babloo was expecting
a girl but an old woman came.

278
00:15:52,231 --> 00:15:55,273
Dear, see and enjoy the movie.

279
00:15:56,493 --> 00:15:58,092
See and enjoy the movie.

280
00:15:58,172 --> 00:15:59,880
Keep quiet otherwise
I will thrash you.

281
00:15:59,096 --> 00:16:00,493
I think by mistake you
are sitting on the wrong seat.

282
00:16:01,437 --> 00:16:02,531
This is Shaileja's seat.

283
00:16:02,611 --> 00:16:04,142
I am that Shaileja.

284
00:16:04,541 --> 00:16:06,085
In youth Shaileja has turned old.

285
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:07,928
But your age is 24.

286
00:16:09,714 --> 00:16:11,541
Do you have any doubt, handsome?

287
00:16:11,768 --> 00:16:15,631
Railway department made
my age 24 instead of 74.

288
00:16:15,711 --> 00:16:17,923
Don't I look young?

289
00:16:18,063 --> 00:16:21,478
Shaileja, as it is railway
seats are not clean..

290
00:16:21,558 --> 00:16:24,994
..but since you were coming
here he has cleaned your seat.

291
00:16:25,074 --> 00:16:28,863
Oh really. So sweet of you.

292
00:16:29,006 --> 00:16:30,833
I am sorry. I think I
am sitting on the wrong seat.

293
00:16:30,913 --> 00:16:32,018
- Okay.
- Sorry.

294
00:16:42,977 --> 00:16:44,665
Won't you stop following
me grandmother?

295
00:16:44,745 --> 00:16:47,078
Were there fewer boys
that you came here from there?

296
00:16:47,158 --> 00:16:51,473
You naughty boy. I was confused
regarding the seat and not you.

297
00:16:51,553 --> 00:16:52,928
This is my seat.

298
00:16:53,008 --> 00:16:54,501
Grandmother is
increasing the confusion.

299
00:16:57,245 --> 00:16:58,413
Is the medicine bitter?

300
00:16:58,573 --> 00:17:00,596
I had asked the
shopkeeper to put vodka..

301
00:17:00,676 --> 00:17:03,034
..but I think by mistake
he has put whisky.

302
00:17:03,114 --> 00:17:04,458
- Have a sip.
- No, no..

303
00:17:04,538 --> 00:17:06,692
I am still used to drinking milk,
grandmother.

304
00:17:06,772 --> 00:17:08,886
Where are you going? Just one sip..

305
00:17:22,516 --> 00:17:34,047
'English rap song'

306
00:17:52,068 --> 00:17:52,975
Sorry..

307
00:17:54,389 --> 00:17:55,172
It's okay.

308
00:18:13,832 --> 00:18:14,987
Grandmother, you have come again.

309
00:18:15,327 --> 00:18:16,302
I want to show you something.

310
00:18:16,382 --> 00:18:17,548
- Come with me.
- Let's go.

311
00:18:20,697 --> 00:18:21,824
- What do you want to show?
- Look brother..

312
00:18:21,904 --> 00:18:23,843
If you want to make
family relations like this..

313
00:18:23,923 --> 00:18:25,602
..then entire family
should travel together.

314
00:18:25,682 --> 00:18:26,420
Isn't it?

315
00:18:26,005 --> 00:18:27,829
- What will happen by traveling alone?
- Thank you, grandmother.

316
00:18:31,038 --> 00:18:32,362
You have come alone?
Where have you left grandmother?

317
00:18:32,784 --> 00:18:33,816
You take care of your wife.

318
00:18:50,373 --> 00:18:54,674
Girl, beautiful girl.

319
00:18:56,028 --> 00:18:59,216
Hey handsome, listen, listen..

320
00:18:59,976 --> 00:19:01,880
- How does she look?
- I am not able to see.

321
00:19:07,027 --> 00:19:08,981
- How is she?
- Superb.

322
00:19:09,304 --> 00:19:11,482
- Talk to her. Talk to her.
- I will.

323
00:19:13,003 --> 00:19:13,961
Excuse me..

324
00:19:14,913 --> 00:19:16,502
Water, water..where
is the water bottle?

325
00:19:16,582 --> 00:19:19,076
- What are you doing?
- Give me the water..

326
00:19:19,156 --> 00:19:20,681
Take this..

327
00:19:30,785 --> 00:19:31,930
What is your name?

328
00:19:33,978 --> 00:19:36,264
Siddharth Kumar.
Friends call me Siddhu.

329
00:19:36,344 --> 00:19:38,906
- You can call me Sid.
- What is the name of your father?

330
00:19:38,986 --> 00:19:41,034
Krishna Rao.
His father's name is Babu Rao.

331
00:19:41,615 --> 00:19:44,831
- What is your blood group?
- Same like me. B+ve

332
00:19:45,906 --> 00:19:48,657
- And your health condition.
- Fit and fine from top to bottom.

333
00:19:48,737 --> 00:19:50,296
I go to gym for one
hour an swim for two hours.

334
00:19:50,376 --> 00:19:52,809
Full body check up every six months
and donate blood every three months.

335
00:19:52,889 --> 00:19:53,761
I am perfectly okay.

336
00:19:56,346 --> 00:19:59,291
Are you married?

337
00:20:01,191 --> 00:20:03,277
She is much faster forward
than the grandmother.

338
00:20:03,357 --> 00:20:04,357
I am really enjoying.

339
00:20:05,685 --> 00:20:07,306
I don't have experience.
Is it okay with you?

340
00:20:08,673 --> 00:20:11,042
I hope your family members
will not have an objection.

341
00:20:11,122 --> 00:20:13,167
Not at all.
They were waiting for this moment.

342
00:20:13,247 --> 00:20:15,846
If I agree then they will also agree.

343
00:20:15,926 --> 00:20:16,859
Do you agree?

344
00:20:16,939 --> 00:20:18,846
It is okay from my side as well.

345
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:21,642
You just have to sign here.

346
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:23,135
Why do you want a sign?

347
00:20:23,277 --> 00:20:26,890
You need a sign before
donating organs.

348
00:20:30,615 --> 00:20:32,001
Organ donation.

349
00:20:33,051 --> 00:20:34,344
What do you do?

350
00:20:34,424 --> 00:20:38,299
I have completed my studies.
I work for a NGO as a volunteer.

351
00:20:38,418 --> 00:20:43,272
Did you hear dear?
Let your body be of use to someone.

352
00:20:43,352 --> 00:20:45,379
- Come on sign it.
- I will sign.

353
00:20:45,613 --> 00:20:46,860
Thank you very much.

354
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:49,797
As per the target I
need sign for 9 more people.

355
00:20:49,877 --> 00:20:50,771
You are the first one.

356
00:20:50,851 --> 00:20:53,187
In such a big train
you just caught hold of me.

357
00:20:53,267 --> 00:20:56,324
I tried a lot but no one
is interested in organ donation.

358
00:20:56,917 --> 00:20:59,206
People are interested. They both.

359
00:21:00,679 --> 00:21:02,433
Hey stupid,
what are your plans after death?

360
00:21:02,513 --> 00:21:05,568
Don't even look at me. I have a stone
in the kidney and hole in the heart.

361
00:21:05,648 --> 00:21:07,315
I have infection in blood
and swelling in the liver.

362
00:21:07,395 --> 00:21:09,437
- All organs are waste.
- He is useless.

363
00:21:09,517 --> 00:21:11,349
He seems to be very strong.
He will do it.

364
00:21:11,429 --> 00:21:12,628
Just forget that I will do.

365
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:13,914
I am not going to
do anything of this sort.

366
00:21:13,994 --> 00:21:15,947
I gave donation to her
and this was the result.

367
00:21:16,027 --> 00:21:18,999
She has given 10th exams five
times but has still not passed once.

368
00:21:19,079 --> 00:21:21,814
I donated my sister to brother-in-law
then next day he also expired.

369
00:21:21,894 --> 00:21:23,975
I donated suit to neighbor
and his wife ran away.

370
00:21:24,055 --> 00:21:26,099
That is why I am saying
don't ask me to donate anything.

371
00:21:26,179 --> 00:21:27,456
It's okay. It is not necessary.

372
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:29,281
What is this?
Why did you accept defeat so easily?

373
00:21:29,361 --> 00:21:30,787
There are many organs in the train.

374
00:21:30,867 --> 00:21:32,760
Your target is now our target.

375
00:21:32,084 --> 00:21:33,155
I will just get an organ.

376
00:21:33,991 --> 00:21:40,385
Baldy listen, this Romeo will
help the Juliet to achieve her target.

377
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:42,527
So that his target is also achieved.

378
00:21:46,494 --> 00:21:49,721
Sheilja,
she is my grandmother who is old.

379
00:21:50,003 --> 00:21:52,056
- Greetings.
- You are beautiful.

380
00:21:53,352 --> 00:21:55,433
- Grandmother.
- Sorry, sorry very sorry.

381
00:21:55,594 --> 00:21:57,636
The train is moving too fast.

382
00:21:57,716 --> 00:22:01,949
Listen baldy, the person will keep
shaking to whom she donates her organs.

383
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:04,064
- What are you saying, stupid?
- Don't pay attention to this fool.

384
00:22:04,459 --> 00:22:06,504
Sheilja, my grandmother
is ready for this kind work.

385
00:22:06,584 --> 00:22:09,620
Who are you to do this kind work? What
is left with her to donate to others?

386
00:22:09,007 --> 00:22:10,510
It seems as if a skeleton
is covered with clothes.

387
00:22:11,283 --> 00:22:12,499
She must not be having under her hat.

388
00:22:12,579 --> 00:22:13,445
You fool.

389
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:16,894
Hey handsome, they both
are together planning something.

390
00:22:16,974 --> 00:22:18,296
- I will not spare him.
- Control, grandmother..

391
00:22:18,376 --> 00:22:19,329
..otherwise the intoxication will go.

392
00:22:19,605 --> 00:22:20,281
You sit.

393
00:22:20,575 --> 00:22:21,668
You write the detail and I will..

394
00:22:21,748 --> 00:22:23,333
- ..go and find someone else.
- Listen, wait..

395
00:22:23,413 --> 00:22:26,335
He is smart. His body is strong too.

396
00:22:26,415 --> 00:22:28,199
Start filling the form.

397
00:22:28,279 --> 00:22:30,963
If your heart is so weak then why
did you mess up with a strong lady?

398
00:22:31,043 --> 00:22:33,002
The woman is not strong
but the medicine is strong.

399
00:22:33,082 --> 00:22:35,238
We will have to set her
right at the right moment.

400
00:22:35,318 --> 00:22:36,357
After getting own from train.

401
00:22:36,437 --> 00:22:38,301
Or what do you think
after reaching home, you fool.

402
00:22:42,207 --> 00:22:43,526
Hello brother-in-law tell me.

403
00:22:43,606 --> 00:22:45,700
Your sister is saying that till you
don't come she will not cut the cake.

404
00:22:46,626 --> 00:22:47,435
Till when will you reach?

405
00:22:47,515 --> 00:22:48,783
I am already in the train.

406
00:22:48,863 --> 00:22:51,599
Brother-in-law, are you
getting a gift or not this time?

407
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:53,508
Or like every time you
are coming empty handed.

408
00:22:53,588 --> 00:22:55,394
I am getting sister-in-law for sister,
brother-in-law.

409
00:22:55,788 --> 00:22:56,843
What did you say/
what are you getting?

410
00:22:57,418 --> 00:22:59,144
Right now I am busy in social work.
We will talk later.

411
00:22:59,224 --> 00:22:59,986
Listen..

412
00:23:02,565 --> 00:23:05,226
- Johny, Johny..
- Yes papa.

413
00:23:05,306 --> 00:23:07,843
- Eating Sugar.
- No, Papa.

414
00:23:07,923 --> 00:23:10,488
- Telling lies.
- No Papa.

415
00:23:10,568 --> 00:23:12,039
Open your mouth..

416
00:23:13,344 --> 00:23:15,195
- Did you have a son so soon?
- Keep quiet.

417
00:23:15,691 --> 00:23:17,528
Madam, he is ready. Fill in the form.

418
00:23:17,782 --> 00:23:18,845
What are his details?

419
00:23:18,925 --> 00:23:20,063
His heart is bigger than yours.

420
00:23:20,143 --> 00:23:21,829
The child is ready
to donate that as well.

421
00:23:23,511 --> 00:23:26,203
What is this?
Now he will make him donate organs.

422
00:23:26,283 --> 00:23:29,131
Don't you know that
his body is not yet formed?

423
00:23:29,211 --> 00:23:34,027
His brain, kidney,
liver and heart would be small.

424
00:23:34,107 --> 00:23:35,660
The small things would
be of no use to madam.

425
00:23:35,074 --> 00:23:37,128
Keep quiet, fool.
Madam, write the detail.

426
00:23:38,175 --> 00:23:38,737
Look..

427
00:23:38,817 --> 00:23:40,691
First ask him if he knows
the name of his mother.

428
00:23:40,771 --> 00:23:41,802
Not only name he knows
the spelling as well.

429
00:23:42,161 --> 00:23:44,424
- Ask him. - Child, what is the
name of your mother?

430
00:23:44,504 --> 00:23:46,687
Mother's name is Mummy.

431
00:23:46,885 --> 00:23:48,042
I had said correctly.

432
00:23:48,122 --> 00:23:50,193
He will tell that his mother's
name is mummy and father's name daddy.

433
00:23:50,273 --> 00:23:51,317
Will it be right to get all
this done from such an innocent child.

434
00:23:51,793 --> 00:23:52,926
Will it not be a crime?

435
00:23:53,102 --> 00:23:55,167
He has got scared
seeing your scary face.

436
00:23:55,247 --> 00:23:57,279
- Don't scare him more.
- I am not scaring him but saving him.

437
00:23:57,359 --> 00:23:59,108
- Siddharth, that..
- Wait for a second..

438
00:23:59,684 --> 00:24:00,759
Tell me your mother' name
then you will get chocolate..

439
00:24:01,514 --> 00:24:02,766
..toffee,
ice cream and whatever you ask for.

440
00:24:02,846 --> 00:24:04,922
Actually children
cannot donate organs.

441
00:24:05,987 --> 00:24:09,308
Thank you for saving this
innocent child from his slaughter.

442
00:24:09,388 --> 00:24:12,519
Did you see baldy? To impress this
girl he is killing this old woman.

443
00:24:12,599 --> 00:24:13,798
And he is putting the child at stake.

444
00:24:13,878 --> 00:24:16,039
Go child from where you came.

445
00:24:16,119 --> 00:24:17,752
Mother, save me.

446
00:24:17,832 --> 00:24:19,493
I had asked you to keep quiet.

447
00:24:19,573 --> 00:24:21,038
- You unnecessarily made the child cry.
- What happened, Golu?

448
00:24:21,118 --> 00:24:22,144
Did anyone hit you?

449
00:24:22,857 --> 00:24:24,951
Sister, I saved your Golu, sister.

450
00:24:25,877 --> 00:24:27,936
He would have put him
on stake just to woo her.

451
00:24:28,016 --> 00:24:28,885
You will never remain happy.

452
00:24:28,965 --> 00:24:30,273
Just to woo a girl you
take support of a child.

453
00:24:30,353 --> 00:24:31,704
- Keep quiet, child.
- Why are you saying like this?

454
00:24:31,784 --> 00:24:32,952
- Nothing of this sort happened.
- Now he will not keep..

455
00:24:33,032 --> 00:24:34,126
..quiet till he hears a song.

456
00:24:34,586 --> 00:24:35,664
Can anyone make this child quiet?

457
00:24:36,499 --> 00:24:37,554
You made him cry so it is your duty.

458
00:24:38,129 --> 00:24:40,577
I have sworn not to speak. Ask
him to sing a song and make him quiet.

459
00:24:40,657 --> 00:24:42,822
I will surely sing.
Two times I have received a prize.

460
00:24:42,954 --> 00:24:44,352
I know you must have received.

461
00:24:44,432 --> 00:24:47,843
One to start the song
and second to stop the song.

462
00:24:47,923 --> 00:24:49,048
Sir, shall I talk?

463
00:24:49,216 --> 00:24:50,323
Siddharth, will you sing a song?

464
00:24:50,403 --> 00:24:52,094
- Yes.
- Hurry up. Maybe he keeps quiet.

465
00:24:52,479 --> 00:24:53,448
Come.

466
00:24:53,891 --> 00:24:55,042
Mike testing.

467
00:24:58,895 --> 00:24:58,972
The music is ready.

468
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:01,821
"The pigeon flew above.."

469
00:25:02,051 --> 00:25:03,650
"Show me a glimpse.."

470
00:25:03,073 --> 00:25:04,437
"Dance.."

471
00:25:05,174 --> 00:25:07,898
- Give me lift..
- Keep quiet.

472
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:10,179
Look at the condition of the child.

473
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:12,123
His mouth is so wide open
that a laddoo can go inside.

474
00:25:12,203 --> 00:25:14,306
Even flies are moving.

475
00:25:14,386 --> 00:25:16,564
- He has nothing in his mouth.
- Then put it in his mouth.

476
00:25:16,644 --> 00:25:18,906
- Sister, take him away.
- Yes Golu, let's go.

477
00:25:19,063 --> 00:25:19,860
Excuse me.

478
00:25:21,769 --> 00:25:23,590
The child had made
his mouth so wide open.

479
00:25:23,067 --> 00:25:24,074
Show me your ticket.

480
00:25:24,757 --> 00:25:26,534
Couldn't you come earlier?

481
00:25:26,614 --> 00:25:29,265
We are tired of his tyranny.
Please give us another seat.

482
00:25:29,345 --> 00:25:30,370
First show your ticket.

483
00:25:30,045 --> 00:25:30,122
Give me the ticket.

484
00:25:31,003 --> 00:25:32,085
- How will I have your ticket?
- It is in the pocket of the pants.

485
00:25:33,002 --> 00:25:33,593
Give.

486
00:25:35,531 --> 00:25:38,035
Please help us to get another seat.

487
00:25:39,154 --> 00:25:41,332
The seat cannot be changed
as the date has already been changed.

488
00:25:41,412 --> 00:25:42,427
Oh no! It was yesterday's ticket.

489
00:25:42,507 --> 00:25:44,333
- You have to pay penalty of 3,000/-
- What?

490
00:25:44,591 --> 00:25:46,529
- Hurry up, give me.
- I just have 200/-

491
00:25:46,609 --> 00:25:47,790
Give money if you have.

492
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:48,448
- Come on get down from the train.
- Can't you check the date's.

493
00:25:49,311 --> 00:25:50,482
Hurry up otherwise
I will call the police.

494
00:25:50,562 --> 00:25:51,527
He seems to be a beggar from face.

495
00:25:51,607 --> 00:25:53,083
- Hurry up and get down.
- Get up. You are sitting comfortably.

496
00:25:53,163 --> 00:25:53,820
Hurry up and go.

497
00:25:53,009 --> 00:25:54,094
Take these underpants
and put them in bag.

498
00:25:55,092 --> 00:25:56,279
Everything has happened because
of you, inauspicious person.

499
00:25:57,187 --> 00:25:58,462
- Hey loudspeaker..
- Yes tell me.

500
00:25:59,843 --> 00:26:01,406
I was watching your
drama since morning.

501
00:26:01,486 --> 00:26:03,509
You had a problem
when grandmother came.

502
00:26:03,796 --> 00:26:05,480
I brought the child
even then you had problem.

503
00:26:05,056 --> 00:26:07,230
- Are you my father?
- No.

504
00:26:07,814 --> 00:26:08,966
- Are you my uncle?
- No.

505
00:26:09,046 --> 00:26:10,050
- Are you my friend?
- No.

506
00:26:10,166 --> 00:26:11,322
Then what is the problem?

507
00:26:11,772 --> 00:26:12,927
Why were you flirting?

508
00:26:13,007 --> 00:26:15,010
Whether I flirt or run away,
what problem do you have?

509
00:26:15,009 --> 00:26:16,342
I wanted to woo the girl.

510
00:26:16,503 --> 00:26:17,469
You rascal,
characterless..having a wife..

511
00:26:17,549 --> 00:26:18,985
..on your side you
wanted to woo a girl.

512
00:26:19,065 --> 00:26:22,977
Wait handsome wait..I
will set him right.

513
00:26:23,057 --> 00:26:25,605
The girl who was sitting
next to you has gone near the gate.

514
00:26:25,685 --> 00:26:26,884
Go, go otherwise eshe
will slip from your hands..

515
00:26:26,964 --> 00:26:28,953
- Okay, but do not spare him.
- Okay go..

516
00:26:29,187 --> 00:26:30,980
You act smart like a hero.

517
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:33,512
- Madam, leave my collar.
- What will you do otherwise?

518
00:26:33,646 --> 00:26:37,707
First leave my collar.
Forgive me. I fall at your feet.

519
00:26:48,522 --> 00:26:49,284
What happened?

520
00:26:50,139 --> 00:26:51,868
I cannot understand how I should say.

521
00:26:54,086 --> 00:26:55,122
Say it. Why are you thinking so much?

522
00:26:57,027 --> 00:26:58,231
Are you flirting with me?

523
00:26:58,622 --> 00:27:02,181
That is not the case.
I have fallen in love with you.

524
00:27:06,005 --> 00:27:06,992
Do you like me?

525
00:27:09,073 --> 00:27:11,992
I like you. I like your behavior.

526
00:27:12,471 --> 00:27:14,097
Your nature is also good.

527
00:27:14,283 --> 00:27:16,898
In fact any girl will like you.

528
00:27:17,012 --> 00:27:18,110
So shall I consider
the relationship confirmed?

529
00:27:20,942 --> 00:27:23,639
Actually I have no love
like feelings in my heart.

530
00:27:28,841 --> 00:27:30,046
Are you married?

531
00:27:31,109 --> 00:27:31,826
No.

532
00:27:31,098 --> 00:27:32,852
- Any boyfriend?
- No.

533
00:27:33,997 --> 00:27:34,090
Live in relation?

534
00:27:35,928 --> 00:27:37,433
None of these options.

535
00:27:37,615 --> 00:27:40,152
Then no tension. I will make
you wear a scared thread for sure.

536
00:27:40,396 --> 00:27:42,295
- How can you be so confident?
- Destiny.

537
00:27:43,005 --> 00:27:45,078
The girl I saw on
the platform vanished.

538
00:27:45,653 --> 00:27:47,131
It seemed as if my luck was annoyed.

539
00:27:47,241 --> 00:27:49,215
The same girl comes and
sits on the seat opposite to mine.

540
00:27:49,329 --> 00:27:50,396
I want we both should
talk with each other.

541
00:27:51,079 --> 00:27:52,244
And she makes the start.

542
00:27:52,324 --> 00:27:54,488
It is clearly destiny.
We are made for each other.

543
00:27:55,245 --> 00:27:57,693
It is not destiny
but just a co-incidence.

544
00:27:57,773 --> 00:27:59,648
Once the journey is over
we both will be somewhere else.

545
00:27:59,728 --> 00:28:01,543
No. You want or not..

546
00:28:01,623 --> 00:28:03,837
- ..but our union will surely
take place. - Magazine, magazine..

547
00:28:05,973 --> 00:28:07,442
- Give me a pen.
- Take it, madam.

548
00:28:11,829 --> 00:28:12,533
Go.

549
00:28:13,085 --> 00:28:15,644
I have written my name
and contact number on that book.

550
00:28:15,724 --> 00:28:19,931
The day this book comes to
you somehow I will believe in destiny.

551
00:28:20,011 --> 00:28:22,182
And will surely think about you.

552
00:28:23,549 --> 00:28:24,514
Excuse me.

553
00:28:31,003 --> 00:28:34,715
Don't worry handsome.
Your future is surely with that girl.

554
00:28:34,876 --> 00:28:36,489
This is blessing of a grandmother.

555
00:28:36,662 --> 00:28:38,616
None of my promises fail.

556
00:28:38,696 --> 00:28:40,481
My blessings are with you.

557
00:28:41,145 --> 00:28:44,534
Be positive, my boy. Be positive.

558
00:28:45,798 --> 00:28:47,785
My whisky is missing me.

559
00:29:39,061 --> 00:29:41,720
Minister sir,
please see this file and sign.

560
00:29:48,808 --> 00:29:49,829
PR..

561
00:29:49,987 --> 00:29:52,332
Keep this file with you.
I will sign it later.

562
00:29:52,412 --> 00:29:53,577
Look, PR is coming behind you.

563
00:29:53,657 --> 00:29:55,412
Take the car to the side.
Take the car to the ide.

564
00:30:21,609 --> 00:30:25,040
Minister, sir you are joining
hands to him. Who is he?

565
00:30:25,163 --> 00:30:29,592
Collector, you are new.
He is a great a man.

566
00:30:29,672 --> 00:30:31,203
Political king maker.

567
00:30:31,369 --> 00:30:35,411
He can make a comman man a
minister and minister a common man.

568
00:30:35,869 --> 00:30:39,061
- Is that so? - He is the most
powerful man of Bengal.

569
00:30:39,141 --> 00:30:40,078
Do you know that?

570
00:30:44,311 --> 00:30:46,607
Because of him I am a minister today.

571
00:30:46,687 --> 00:30:48,532
And will always remain.

572
00:31:01,165 --> 00:31:01,972
Hi, brother-in-law.

573
00:31:02,052 --> 00:31:04,227
Thank you so much for
arriving in our house.

574
00:31:04,357 --> 00:31:06,884
You were going to come with a lady
but you just brought a lady's purse.

575
00:31:08,362 --> 00:31:08,434
How did you like?

576
00:31:09,962 --> 00:31:11,729
Absolutely traditional.

577
00:31:12,775 --> 00:31:14,386
Why are you calling traditional?
Don't you feel it is modern?

578
00:31:14,924 --> 00:31:16,299
I will peak what I can see.

579
00:31:16,379 --> 00:31:17,014
After so many months..

580
00:31:17,094 --> 00:31:18,613
- ..you are still a fool.
- Come in and meet your sister first.

581
00:31:19,524 --> 00:31:21,828
You wait.
First put your right foot in.

582
00:31:22,042 --> 00:31:23,193
What is your name?

583
00:31:23,315 --> 00:31:24,316
- Laxmi.
- Laxmi!

584
00:31:25,079 --> 00:31:27,717
You are Laxmi incarnate.
You are even the Laxmi of my house.

585
00:31:27,797 --> 00:31:30,559
You are meeting me for the
first time so take this gift from me.

586
00:31:30,639 --> 00:31:30,720
No, no..

587
00:31:31,912 --> 00:31:32,754
Please do not refuse.

588
00:31:32,834 --> 00:31:34,295
It will suit you more than me.

589
00:31:34,507 --> 00:31:36,891
How will you find that
girl in such a big city?

590
00:31:37,178 --> 00:31:38,589
Coincidence takes
place only in movies.

591
00:31:38,669 --> 00:31:39,848
I will surely woo her.

592
00:31:39,928 --> 00:31:43,553
Surekha, Surekha, Laxmi is
standing out so won't you welcome her.

593
00:31:43,706 --> 00:31:45,371
So shall I formally welcome her?

594
00:31:45,451 --> 00:31:46,475
If you are a sister-in-law..

595
00:31:46,555 --> 00:31:47,753
..then you will have to
welcome your sister-in-law too.

596
00:31:47,833 --> 00:31:49,252
She is not Laxmi of the
house but a maid servant.

597
00:31:49,533 --> 00:31:50,658
- Maid servant?
- Yes.

598
00:31:50,738 --> 00:31:52,012
She is going to start work from today.

599
00:31:52,092 --> 00:31:53,565
Oh God, I made a mistake.

600
00:31:53,698 --> 00:31:54,482
What mistake?

601
00:31:55,215 --> 00:31:58,809
Thinking her to be your brother's
lover I gave her a small gift.

602
00:31:59,064 --> 00:32:00,211
Get me my gold chain back.

603
00:32:00,714 --> 00:32:03,282
Foolish man. he always does like this.

604
00:32:03,362 --> 00:32:04,860
Sister, why are you taking tension?

605
00:32:04,094 --> 00:32:05,883
That was not original
gold but was impure gold.

606
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:08,240
That was impure.

607
00:32:08,032 --> 00:32:09,288
When I was here in hostel..

608
00:32:09,656 --> 00:32:11,659
..then I had sold your
chain to give party to friends.

609
00:32:11,739 --> 00:32:13,208
That means for last 5 years I was..

610
00:32:13,288 --> 00:32:14,882
..wearing an impure gold
chain thinking it to be real.

611
00:32:15,037 --> 00:32:18,326
Tell me that the girl
you met in train real or fake?

612
00:32:18,739 --> 00:32:20,221
Where is that girl now?

613
00:32:20,301 --> 00:32:21,259
I have to find her.

614
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:22,397
What do you mean?
You do not know her address also.

615
00:32:22,999 --> 00:32:23,988
I have to find that.

616
00:32:24,068 --> 00:32:26,074
- Where will you find her?
- On her address.

617
00:32:26,225 --> 00:32:30,542
It has been three days
since he is finding Sheilja.

618
00:32:34,094 --> 00:32:36,517
What is this brother? it has been three
days that we are finding that girl..

619
00:32:36,597 --> 00:32:37,789
..from morning to evening.

620
00:32:37,932 --> 00:32:38,966
Does the girl stay in this city?

621
00:32:39,046 --> 00:32:40,538
Stupid, she must be staying somewhere.

622
00:32:40,618 --> 00:32:41,282
Destiny.

623
00:32:41,362 --> 00:32:41,454
If she is in my destiny..

624
00:32:42,362 --> 00:32:43,670
- ..then she will come in front of me.
- Now, only God will save us.

625
00:32:51,479 --> 00:32:53,326
Hey, thief what did
you steal before running.

626
00:32:53,406 --> 00:32:55,124
- Nothing, sir.
- What is this?

627
00:32:55,204 --> 00:32:56,237
Yes sir I have stolen it.

628
00:32:56,317 --> 00:32:58,259
- Will you on foot or in the car?
- Sir, please let me go.

629
00:32:58,389 --> 00:33:00,746
Don't you have any sense?
You steal a chain in public place.

630
00:33:00,826 --> 00:33:02,552
At least you should have
first stolen a cycle to run away.

631
00:33:02,632 --> 00:33:03,531
It would be easier for you to run.

632
00:33:03,611 --> 00:33:04,469
- Sir..
- Tell me.

633
00:33:04,549 --> 00:33:06,582
You are great, sir.

634
00:33:07,077 --> 00:33:09,104
You make me your disciple.

635
00:33:09,555 --> 00:33:12,234
Hey, catch hold of him. He is a thief.

636
00:33:18,055 --> 00:33:18,869
Where are you running?

637
00:33:18,949 --> 00:33:19,918
Master, let me go.

638
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:21,030
How dare you steal, rascal?

639
00:33:21,508 --> 00:33:23,655
You should have become
a doctor engineer after studying.

640
00:33:23,735 --> 00:33:24,701
You became a chain snatcher.

641
00:33:24,781 --> 00:33:27,025
Do you know he was going to
sell your chain in the thief's market?

642
00:33:27,105 --> 00:33:27,652
Hit him.

643
00:33:27,933 --> 00:33:29,756
Go, go run away from here.

644
00:33:29,896 --> 00:33:31,583
Hey, don't you have any sense?

645
00:33:31,663 --> 00:33:32,975
Does anyone wear a gold
chain while coming to the park?

646
00:33:33,055 --> 00:33:34,034
Are we a security guard?

647
00:33:34,114 --> 00:33:34,183
- Hey..
- What is it?

648
00:33:34,884 --> 00:33:36,063
She is your sister-in-law.

649
00:33:37,073 --> 00:33:37,890
Is she the one?

650
00:33:39,382 --> 00:33:40,850
Don't feel bad about
what that foolish said.

651
00:33:40,973 --> 00:33:41,977
Did you recognize me?

652
00:33:42,434 --> 00:33:43,391
Train, destiny..

653
00:33:43,471 --> 00:33:44,507
Yes, yes I remember everything.

654
00:33:44,587 --> 00:33:46,580
That day because of
a thief we separated..

655
00:33:46,066 --> 00:33:47,155
..and today a thief made us meet.
This is called destiny.

656
00:33:48,063 --> 00:33:49,112
This is not called destiny.

657
00:33:50,101 --> 00:33:51,817
Did you get that book?

658
00:33:51,897 --> 00:33:53,595
Where will I find that book?

659
00:33:53,993 --> 00:33:55,080
Sheilja,
from the time I have seen you..

660
00:33:56,088 --> 00:33:57,825
..I do not know what
has happened to me.

661
00:33:57,905 --> 00:33:59,251
While sleeping and
being awake I see you.

662
00:33:59,331 --> 00:34:00,787
- She is going.
- On sheet, pillow..

663
00:34:00,867 --> 00:34:03,124
From the bonnet of the car
to the cover of pressure cooker.

664
00:34:03,204 --> 00:34:04,705
Turn around, she has gone.

665
00:34:04,785 --> 00:34:05,499
- What?
- Yes.

666
00:34:09,264 --> 00:34:11,035
Oh God, earthquake has come.

667
00:34:12,153 --> 00:34:13,306
- My head..
- Brother-in-law..

668
00:34:13,386 --> 00:34:14,457
The cake is here, the knife
is here so what are you waiting for?

669
00:34:15,176 --> 00:34:16,049
Where is the one who
has happy birthday today?

670
00:34:16,164 --> 00:34:18,211
I beg of you brother-in-law
to first go and pacify your sister.

671
00:34:18,979 --> 00:34:19,788
What is the problem?

672
00:34:19,868 --> 00:34:20,822
Which flavor is the cake?

673
00:34:20,902 --> 00:34:22,740
Leave about the flavor but this
is the main reason of the problem.

674
00:34:22,082 --> 00:34:23,521
- Sweety..
- What did you say?

675
00:34:24,339 --> 00:34:25,220
Who is this Sweety?

676
00:34:25,003 --> 00:34:27,057
Since morning your sister
is also asking me the same question.

677
00:34:27,092 --> 00:34:28,150
One second.
There is definitely some confusion.

678
00:34:29,058 --> 00:34:29,742
The sound is not coming.

679
00:34:30,344 --> 00:34:31,799
- Hope she will not lift
the cylinder and throw. - Hello..

680
00:34:31,879 --> 00:34:34,278
..listen, Champak. Why have
you written Sweety on my cake?

681
00:34:34,437 --> 00:34:36,844
Sir, your cake has gone to
someone else's house by mistake.

682
00:34:36,986 --> 00:34:39,617
Hey because of your mistake my sister
was about to kill my brother-in-law.

683
00:34:39,697 --> 00:34:41,091
Hurry up and message
me Sweety's address.

684
00:34:41,171 --> 00:34:42,187
- Okay, I will do it immediately.
- Okay.

685
00:34:47,469 --> 00:34:48,445
Hello, Shellu..

686
00:34:48,525 --> 00:34:50,130
I was about to give you a call.

687
00:34:50,021 --> 00:34:51,743
I have to send an urgent mail.

688
00:34:52,012 --> 00:34:53,087
The cake that I had
ordered has arrived.

689
00:34:53,842 --> 00:34:56,340
- I will reach the party on time.
- Listen to what I am saying.

690
00:34:56,042 --> 00:34:58,429
I was making Sweety ready
after the bath for the party..

691
00:34:58,887 --> 00:35:00,999
..then I saw she's
had rashes on the body.

692
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:02,211
She has fever too.

693
00:35:02,903 --> 00:35:05,121
Listen, do not take tension.
Do as I say.

694
00:35:14,823 --> 00:35:16,605
- You, here..
- Your cake..

695
00:35:16,685 --> 00:35:18,073
First tell me what I should do.

696
00:35:18,257 --> 00:35:19,336
Hello, are you listening?

697
00:35:20,085 --> 00:35:20,912
Bring it inside.

698
00:35:21,086 --> 00:35:21,969
Okay.

699
00:35:22,049 --> 00:35:23,666
I think she is alone at home.

700
00:35:25,228 --> 00:35:25,236
Have you come inside?

701
00:35:27,241 --> 00:35:29,602
First cool down and
keep it on the table.

702
00:35:31,708 --> 00:35:34,215
- Keep it, buddy.
- Yes I have kept her.

703
00:35:35,155 --> 00:35:36,082
What do I do now?

704
00:35:36,428 --> 00:35:37,620
Now hurry up and remove clothes.

705
00:35:38,364 --> 00:35:39,211
Okay, okay..

706
00:35:40,031 --> 00:35:40,968
Remove the T-shirt.

707
00:35:42,997 --> 00:35:44,438
- Directly T-shirt.
- Come on.

708
00:35:45,415 --> 00:35:46,461
I have removed it.

709
00:35:47,102 --> 00:35:48,957
Okay. Now it is the turn of the pant.

710
00:35:49,792 --> 00:35:50,767
She is making me remove my clothes.

711
00:35:51,084 --> 00:35:53,207
Now will I have to
explain such a small thing?

712
00:35:53,287 --> 00:35:55,374
How will it happen
without removing the pant?

713
00:35:57,874 --> 00:35:59,903
Okay tell me how is she feeling?

714
00:35:59,983 --> 00:36:01,384
I am feeling a little tensed.

715
00:36:01,464 --> 00:36:03,539
It is first time so
being tensed is natural.

716
00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:04,993
Slowly, slowly you will get habitual.

717
00:36:05,073 --> 00:36:06,112
I have experience.

718
00:36:06,192 --> 00:36:07,264
Okay, now pinch from behind.

719
00:36:08,597 --> 00:36:09,986
What? What are you saying?

720
00:36:10,066 --> 00:36:12,123
She will feel good after pinching.

721
00:36:13,655 --> 00:36:15,096
Come on do it.

722
00:36:15,761 --> 00:36:17,335
Come on, do it.

723
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:20,260
Hey, I am asking you to pinch.

724
00:36:20,527 --> 00:36:21,399
Do it.

725
00:36:24,025 --> 00:36:24,100
Don't you have any sense?

726
00:36:25,008 --> 00:36:26,670
Does anyone behave like this
after coming to a girl's house?

727
00:36:26,822 --> 00:36:28,401
You had asked to remove clothes.

728
00:36:28,481 --> 00:36:31,170
Oh God. I was not talking
to you but to my friend on Bluetooth.

729
00:36:31,025 --> 00:36:32,082
So Shailja the point is that..

730
00:36:33,506 --> 00:36:34,574
Sorry..

731
00:36:34,862 --> 00:36:38,398
Look first we met in train,
then for chain and now for cake.

732
00:36:38,478 --> 00:36:39,812
This is signal of true love.

733
00:36:39,892 --> 00:36:41,409
This is called destiny.

734
00:36:41,489 --> 00:36:43,152
Look, I don't like these things.

735
00:36:43,232 --> 00:36:46,107
I am leaving this city and
there is no chance to meet lifelong.

736
00:36:46,187 --> 00:36:47,433
But Shailja..

737
00:36:48,168 --> 00:36:49,481
Do not disturb me.

738
00:36:57,423 --> 00:36:58,657
Listen, Siddharth.

739
00:36:58,737 --> 00:37:01,888
You love him so much. He
just refused once and you are going.

740
00:37:01,968 --> 00:37:03,230
Try to make her understand.

741
00:37:03,031 --> 00:37:04,416
I have wasted a lot of time on her.

742
00:37:04,775 --> 00:37:05,598
I will call once I reach home.

743
00:37:05,678 --> 00:37:06,750
- Listen..
- Listen, Siddharth.

744
00:37:06,977 --> 00:37:08,096
What kind of a boy is he?

745
00:37:11,335 --> 00:37:14,304
What is this Shellu? It is time for
the train and you are still not ready.

746
00:37:15,692 --> 00:37:17,738
- If he comes here
and I am not there then.. - Who?

747
00:37:18,529 --> 00:37:19,851
Siddharth.

748
00:37:20,023 --> 00:37:22,696
Once I leave he will
try to find me like crazy.

749
00:37:22,776 --> 00:37:25,263
Shellu, I hope you
have not fallen in love.

750
00:37:28,922 --> 00:37:32,313
Yes, I think.
I feel there is sincerity in his love.

751
00:37:32,393 --> 00:37:36,022
To be honest when he
saw me at the station..

752
00:37:36,102 --> 00:37:38,106
..I had already seen him.

753
00:37:38,827 --> 00:37:40,492
I was praying to God that..

754
00:37:40,572 --> 00:37:43,357
..he should come and sit
on the seat opposite to me.

755
00:37:43,581 --> 00:37:44,926
And that is what happened.

756
00:37:46,137 --> 00:37:49,740
I liked the way he
was trying to see me.

757
00:37:53,262 --> 00:37:54,445
Not only this.

758
00:37:54,076 --> 00:37:58,493
He was so concerned about
me that he won my heart over.

759
00:37:59,063 --> 00:38:02,454
I was very happy when
he proposed me in the train.

760
00:38:03,329 --> 00:38:05,413
I was scared that I will
never be able to meet him again.

761
00:38:05,569 --> 00:38:07,366
But then I met him in the park.

762
00:38:07,562 --> 00:38:10,325
And then the day when
our cakes got exchanged.

763
00:38:10,672 --> 00:38:14,738
But when I think of father I cannot
express my feelings to Siddharth.

764
00:38:15,412 --> 00:38:18,254
I am scared.
Will I be able to meet him again?

765
00:38:18,334 --> 00:38:21,435
Amazing. When he was
in front of you ignored him.

766
00:38:21,559 --> 00:38:23,687
And now when he is not there
you are fluttering to meet him.

767
00:38:23,874 --> 00:38:26,235
You should have told
him if you liked him so much.

768
00:38:26,479 --> 00:38:28,135
Your love story has come to an end.

769
00:38:35,853 --> 00:38:36,862
What is this man?

770
00:38:36,942 --> 00:38:39,763
You promised me window seat and now
you are making me sit in the centre.

771
00:38:39,843 --> 00:38:42,810
- I want window seat. Window..
- Sit down, mother.. please sit down.

772
00:38:42,089 --> 00:38:45,436
No. I am just going
to sit at the window seat.

773
00:38:48,411 --> 00:38:52,033
My handsome.. hey, handsome.

774
00:38:52,927 --> 00:38:54,932
How are you my hero?

775
00:38:55,012 --> 00:38:55,097
How are you, grandmother?

776
00:38:55,942 --> 00:38:56,993
- I am very fine.
- That's nice.

777
00:38:57,532 --> 00:39:00,126
Why are you alone?
Where has that girl gone?

778
00:39:00,206 --> 00:39:01,670
I don't want to talk about that.

779
00:39:01,075 --> 00:39:03,739
So that means you
did not meet her again.

780
00:39:04,593 --> 00:39:05,518
I don't believe it.

781
00:39:05,598 --> 00:39:08,370
That was just one sided love. The
other party is not at all interested.

782
00:39:08,914 --> 00:39:10,898
Tell me what exactly happened.

783
00:39:16,429 --> 00:39:19,173
- Where did you get this book from?
- I got it from some book stall.

784
00:39:19,253 --> 00:39:22,391
Grandmother, her phone
number is written on this book.

785
00:39:24,176 --> 00:39:25,874
Really? Then what are you waiting for.

786
00:39:25,954 --> 00:39:28,395
- Go and call her.
- Thank you, grandmother.

787
00:39:31,624 --> 00:39:33,600
- Hello.
- Is this Sheilja's number?

788
00:39:33,068 --> 00:39:34,014
Yes, who is speaking?

789
00:39:34,706 --> 00:39:36,730
Sheilja, I am Siddharth calling.

790
00:39:37,078 --> 00:39:37,796
Siddharth, you..

791
00:39:37,876 --> 00:39:39,424
Yes, the same Siddharth
who believed in destiny.

792
00:39:39,504 --> 00:39:40,329
Siddharth..

793
00:39:40,641 --> 00:39:42,898
Do you remember you wrote
your number in a book in the train?

794
00:39:43,116 --> 00:39:46,121
That book was in my
destiny and I have found it.

795
00:39:46,251 --> 00:39:48,415
I had told you that I will
make you wear that sacred thread.

796
00:39:48,495 --> 00:39:50,452
- Hello, are you Siddharth speaking?
- Ask him here he is.

797
00:39:50,871 --> 00:39:51,585
- Ask him..
- Who are you?

798
00:39:51,926 --> 00:39:53,429
I am Sheileja's friend speaking.

799
00:39:53,682 --> 00:39:55,749
- Ask him..
- Where are you now?

800
00:40:20,545 --> 00:40:22,548
I love you Siddharth.

801
00:40:34,544 --> 00:40:36,906
- Help me to decorate flowers.
- You are doing it well.

802
00:40:37,254 --> 00:40:38,331
Look, they both have also come.

803
00:40:39,502 --> 00:40:41,043
Why did you take so much time to come?

804
00:40:43,234 --> 00:40:43,330
I think she is the one..

805
00:40:44,274 --> 00:40:44,362
Sister and brother-in-law..

806
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:46,223
- Greetings..
- Greetings..

807
00:40:46,386 --> 00:40:49,469
You are more beautiful than what he
had told me and what I had imagined.

808
00:40:52,577 --> 00:40:53,742
Sister, say it.

809
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:56,674
Don't think that I
am praising my brother.

810
00:40:56,754 --> 00:40:58,633
He is a small boy of 26 years.

811
00:40:58,713 --> 00:41:00,612
He is so small that
he drinks milk from bottle.

812
00:41:02,212 --> 00:41:03,490
My brother-in-law
is jovial in nature..

813
00:41:03,057 --> 00:41:04,538
- ..so don't take it seriously.
- Where is the Sari?

814
00:41:05,207 --> 00:41:06,014
Which one?

815
00:41:06,094 --> 00:41:08,063
- The one which we had bought
for Shailja yesterday. - That one.

816
00:41:08,143 --> 00:41:09,200
- Where is it?
- At home.

817
00:41:10,304 --> 00:41:12,628
Oh God. I do not know
when he will grow up.

818
00:41:12,781 --> 00:41:14,103
Siddhu, you go home and get it.

819
00:41:14,183 --> 00:41:16,220
Please do not get involved
in these formalities.

820
00:41:16,633 --> 00:41:19,331
We are meeting you for the first
time so that is why it is required.

821
00:41:19,411 --> 00:41:20,716
How can I send you empty handed?

822
00:41:20,796 --> 00:41:22,304
- Siddhu, go get it.
- Okay.

823
00:41:22,384 --> 00:41:23,866
- You wait. I will go.
- If you go by your speed..

824
00:41:23,946 --> 00:41:25,178
..then you will not
reach before night.

825
00:41:26,711 --> 00:41:28,278
- Go carefully.
- Okay, okay..

826
00:41:28,358 --> 00:41:30,410
Everyone is in trouble
because of my bad memory.

827
00:41:30,719 --> 00:41:31,955
He likes Siddharth..

828
00:41:33,933 --> 00:41:34,859
Hey..

829
00:41:37,014 --> 00:41:39,182
Hey, hey..

830
00:41:43,038 --> 00:41:45,061
- Stop them..
- Hey, stop..

831
00:41:52,271 --> 00:41:53,343
Stop the car.

832
00:41:55,858 --> 00:41:55,953
Hey..

833
00:41:57,084 --> 00:41:58,326
Shailja..

834
00:42:02,105 --> 00:42:03,083
Stop..

835
00:42:03,029 --> 00:42:04,543
Leave her. Stop..

836
00:42:07,365 --> 00:42:08,141
Leave her.

837
00:42:08,072 --> 00:42:08,729
Hey..

838
00:42:10,188 --> 00:42:11,495
- Leave her..
- Stop..

839
00:42:12,306 --> 00:42:13,377
- Hey..
- Stop..

840
00:42:19,914 --> 00:42:21,096
Hey, what has happened?

841
00:42:21,176 --> 00:42:23,221
Pick him up and take
him to the hospital quickly.

842
00:42:23,083 --> 00:42:24,378
Hurry up, pick him up.

843
00:42:25,205 --> 00:42:27,416
- Hurry up and call
the ambulance someone. - Get up.

844
00:42:37,109 --> 00:42:41,405
Siddhu, Shailja's
father got her kidnapped.

845
00:42:48,388 --> 00:42:51,074
You did not believe us.

846
00:42:51,194 --> 00:42:53,496
Your friend is telling
you so now you believe.

847
00:42:55,003 --> 00:42:56,285
- Father, but I..
- Enough..

848
00:42:57,208 --> 00:42:59,274
I do not know whether
the girl is good or not.

849
00:42:59,354 --> 00:43:01,147
But her family is not noble.

850
00:43:01,499 --> 00:43:04,341
But it is your wish if you
still want to have relation with her.

851
00:43:06,508 --> 00:43:08,545
Till now I have kept
myself away from bad things..

852
00:43:09,057 --> 00:43:11,109
..but now I think I will have
to remain away from my son as well.

853
00:43:14,449 --> 00:43:19,326
Now you have to decide whether
you need your parents or your love.

854
00:43:20,072 --> 00:43:21,255
I want both.

855
00:43:22,679 --> 00:43:26,523
Because of such fights
I lost my elder brother.

856
00:43:26,872 --> 00:43:29,279
He died in front of me.

857
00:43:30,199 --> 00:43:33,126
Now your brother-in-law
is fighting for his life.

858
00:43:34,069 --> 00:43:35,348
Whatever may happen..

859
00:43:36,197 --> 00:43:38,812
..but that girl cannot
become a part of this family.

860
00:43:39,211 --> 00:43:41,187
I do not like fights at all.

861
00:43:41,344 --> 00:43:42,768
You will have to forget that girl..

862
00:43:42,848 --> 00:43:44,150
Forget her.. Forget her..

863
00:43:47,713 --> 00:43:50,739
For three months Siddharth
searched Shailja.

864
00:43:51,071 --> 00:43:52,594
But without any success..

865
00:43:52,997 --> 00:43:54,176
And then one day..

866
00:43:59,908 --> 00:44:01,239
Enough, sir..

867
00:44:01,733 --> 00:44:05,148
Hey, I had promised my son..

868
00:44:05,228 --> 00:44:08,883
..that I would kill that rascal.
But I could not do it.

869
00:44:08,963 --> 00:44:10,969
That is why I am punishing myself.

870
00:44:11,049 --> 00:44:11,921
Hit me.

871
00:44:14,943 --> 00:44:15,979
We have found out the
bike number of the person..

872
00:44:16,059 --> 00:44:17,052
..who thrashed younger brother.

873
00:44:17,132 --> 00:44:18,685
Very soon we will
get the address as well.

874
00:44:18,872 --> 00:44:23,516
I do not want his address
but his dead body.

875
00:45:12,338 --> 00:45:13,374
Hail of mother Kali!

876
00:45:14,007 --> 00:45:15,916
- Hail of mother Kali!
- Hello..

877
00:45:20,389 --> 00:45:21,847
Hello, Siddharth.

878
00:45:21,927 --> 00:45:25,135
Hail..!

879
00:45:25,215 --> 00:45:26,816
Hello Siddharth, are you fine?

880
00:45:27,079 --> 00:45:28,092
Shailja..

881
00:45:29,808 --> 00:45:33,425
- Hello..
- Hello, can you hear me?

882
00:45:33,505 --> 00:45:35,331
Hello, I want to tell
you something. Hello..

883
00:45:35,411 --> 00:45:36,238
Hello..

884
00:45:37,167 --> 00:45:37,690
Hello..

885
00:45:37,077 --> 00:45:38,696
Father is getting
me married forcefully.

886
00:45:39,469 --> 00:45:42,091
Hello Shailja, can you hear me?

887
00:45:42,171 --> 00:45:45,225
Hail of mother Kali!

888
00:45:45,791 --> 00:45:46,319
Hello..

889
00:45:56,962 --> 00:45:58,390
- Run..
- Run..

890
00:45:58,047 --> 00:45:59,179
Come run and asve yourselfs.

891
00:45:59,682 --> 00:46:01,060
Siddharth.. Siddharth, hello..

892
00:46:01,053 --> 00:46:01,147
This way..

893
00:46:03,952 --> 00:46:06,759
They have prisoned me the house.
Please save me.

894
00:46:06,891 --> 00:46:08,659
Siddharth. Siddharth.

895
00:46:22,611 --> 00:46:24,155
Hello, Siddharth..

896
00:46:26,084 --> 00:46:28,755
Hello, Siddharth, can you hear me?

897
00:46:30,586 --> 00:46:32,908
Siddharth, save me.

898
00:48:29,465 --> 00:48:31,497
What are you seeing?
Take the car back.

899
00:48:55,784 --> 00:48:57,709
That rascal killed many of our men.

900
00:48:57,974 --> 00:49:00,325
I thought he was not really powerful.

901
00:49:00,522 --> 00:49:02,343
But he is too powerful.

902
00:49:02,831 --> 00:49:04,217
We will have to defeat
him using brain.

903
00:49:04,297 --> 00:49:06,298
Brother, I have found
his family photograph.

904
00:49:09,601 --> 00:49:12,657
Whom does he love
the most among these?

905
00:49:13,337 --> 00:49:16,331
He loves his father a lot
who is sitting in the center.

906
00:49:18,638 --> 00:49:20,502
Then let's kill him.

907
00:49:27,838 --> 00:49:28,985
Hi..

908
00:49:30,926 --> 00:49:33,095
- Good morning, sir.
- Hello, good morning.

909
00:50:03,195 --> 00:50:04,352
- Siddharth..
- How did all this happen?

910
00:50:04,432 --> 00:50:06,646
He met with an accident
while jogging in the morning..

911
00:50:06,802 --> 00:50:10,357
A kind man helped him otherwise
anything would have happened.

912
00:50:15,824 --> 00:50:16,982
Are you okay, father?

913
00:50:19,025 --> 00:50:20,861
I came out of the jaws of death.

914
00:50:21,647 --> 00:50:22,962
Nothing can happen to you.

915
00:50:24,154 --> 00:50:25,316
What is the guarantee?

916
00:50:25,811 --> 00:50:29,523
Listen to me and get
married to that girl.

917
00:50:32,679 --> 00:50:35,668
Till when I will be scared of death.

918
00:50:35,748 --> 00:50:36,947
Not anymore.

919
00:50:37,272 --> 00:50:40,158
Maybe I die without
seeing you getting married.

920
00:50:44,235 --> 00:50:45,553
Don't, talk like this.

921
00:50:45,842 --> 00:50:46,928
I will marry anyone
whom you ask me to marry.

922
00:50:47,898 --> 00:50:48,875
Really, son.

923
00:50:49,106 --> 00:50:50,121
I swear upon you, father.

924
00:50:51,299 --> 00:50:53,687
Thank you, son. Thank you.

925
00:50:53,909 --> 00:50:54,816
Siddharth..

926
00:50:55,666 --> 00:50:57,917
..the one who saved
father has been hurt badly.

927
00:50:58,276 --> 00:50:59,642
He is the next ward.

928
00:50:59,836 --> 00:51:00,909
Go and meet him.

929
00:51:02,383 --> 00:51:03,624
I will just go and meet him.

930
00:51:08,788 --> 00:51:09,843
Excuse me..

931
00:51:19,307 --> 00:51:22,342
- Hey rascal, what are you doing here?
- Calm down.

932
00:51:22,501 --> 00:51:23,829
Who are you son?

933
00:51:24,361 --> 00:51:27,409
I am son of Krishna Rao who you saved.

934
00:51:27,535 --> 00:51:30,571
Oh. Is your father fine?

935
00:51:30,697 --> 00:51:32,002
He is fine. What about you?

936
00:51:32,152 --> 00:51:32,929
I am fine.

937
00:51:33,009 --> 00:51:34,463
Father, this rascal thrashed me.

938
00:51:34,655 --> 00:51:36,907
Arjun, calm down.

939
00:51:37,105 --> 00:51:39,160
Sir, I did not do it purposely.

940
00:51:39,024 --> 00:51:40,352
There is no need to say anything.

941
00:51:40,648 --> 00:51:42,740
I know everything. It is his fault.

942
00:51:42,982 --> 00:51:45,938
I would also have done something
like this if I was in your place.

943
00:51:46,018 --> 00:51:48,066
Okay, so it was my fault.

944
00:51:48,146 --> 00:51:49,614
Because of him I had
to go to the hospital.

945
00:51:49,694 --> 00:51:50,275
Arjun, calm down.

946
00:51:50,355 --> 00:51:52,589
And because of this
rascal my marriage broke.

947
00:51:53,643 --> 00:51:55,081
Arjun, calm down.

948
00:51:55,409 --> 00:51:57,306
- What had happened sir?
- Nothing much.

949
00:51:57,684 --> 00:51:57,763
You can go now.

950
00:51:58,554 --> 00:51:59,849
- Why don't you tell him?
- Calm down.

951
00:51:59,929 --> 00:52:03,267
He should know the problems
we faced due to accident.

952
00:52:03,347 --> 00:52:04,678
Please, tell me sir.

953
00:52:06,446 --> 00:52:08,775
I have a friend named PR.

954
00:52:08,949 --> 00:52:12,531
His daughter and my
son love each other a lot.

955
00:52:12,611 --> 00:52:14,550
Both were going to get married.

956
00:52:15,242 --> 00:52:16,284
I don't know what happened..

957
00:52:17,011 --> 00:52:20,622
..but PR fixed the marriage of her
daughter with son of chief minister.

958
00:52:20,821 --> 00:52:23,474
PR's daughter is talking
about committing suicide.

959
00:52:23,727 --> 00:52:26,039
I was going to stop that marriage.

960
00:52:27,526 --> 00:52:29,370
But everything went wrong.

961
00:52:29,618 --> 00:52:32,292
On the way I met with an accident.

962
00:52:32,811 --> 00:52:34,904
I do not know how I should save her.

963
00:52:35,468 --> 00:52:36,514
You tell me.

964
00:52:38,003 --> 00:52:41,158
None of our men have
the power to go against PR.

965
00:52:42,281 --> 00:52:43,656
Except for brother..

966
00:52:43,832 --> 00:52:46,226
..but because of your
father he met with an accident.

967
00:52:46,375 --> 00:52:48,673
Now, I do not know to whom
we should hand over this work.

968
00:52:49,323 --> 00:52:50,345
I will get her.

969
00:52:53,164 --> 00:52:54,689
It is not children's play.

970
00:52:55,094 --> 00:52:58,143
Without PR's wish no
one can do anything there.

971
00:53:01,888 --> 00:53:04,662
To mess up with PR
means to invite death.

972
00:53:04,742 --> 00:53:06,369
Whether it is PR or his father..

973
00:53:06,449 --> 00:53:08,907
..not me but he is
going to be in problem.

974
00:53:08,987 --> 00:53:10,371
Why are you putting
your life in danger?

975
00:53:10,451 --> 00:53:13,776
You saved my father's life
and I will save your dignity.

976
00:53:14,059 --> 00:53:17,503
You make preparations of
marriage and I will get the girl.

977
00:53:17,076 --> 00:53:18,494
This is my promise.

978
00:53:21,012 --> 00:53:23,898
The plan is good but will it work.

979
00:53:26,407 --> 00:53:28,472
It will work 100%

980
00:53:29,448 --> 00:53:30,886
He is a real man.

981
00:53:30,966 --> 00:53:35,614
PR and he both are
very strong and powerful.

982
00:53:36,526 --> 00:53:38,591
If PR comes in between
then he will crush him.

983
00:53:39,256 --> 00:53:42,061
I had told you that we will
have to defeat him intelligently.

984
00:53:42,391 --> 00:53:45,842
Just wait and watch. He will get that
girl and get her married to my son.

985
00:53:53,479 --> 00:53:56,132
The moment I make CM my relative
you will see my power Chaterjee.

986
00:53:56,212 --> 00:53:57,905
I shall become king of entire Bengal.

987
00:53:57,985 --> 00:53:59,860
All ministers will bow head to me.

988
00:53:59,094 --> 00:54:00,259
This is PR.

989
00:54:03,904 --> 00:54:03,999
Where is Shelja?

990
00:54:04,097 --> 00:54:05,289
Madam is in the room, sir.

991
00:54:07,053 --> 00:54:08,730
Shailja..

992
00:54:33,039 --> 00:54:34,840
Greetings, sir my promotion..

993
00:54:34,092 --> 00:54:35,209
I will talk to the CM.
it will be done.

994
00:54:36,117 --> 00:54:37,033
- Thank you, sir.
- Okay.

995
00:54:41,367 --> 00:54:42,353
Tarzan..

996
00:54:42,806 --> 00:54:44,633
- Yes, brother.
- Keep a watch on her.

997
00:54:44,851 --> 00:54:46,747
She has already tried
to escape twice earlier.

998
00:54:46,939 --> 00:54:49,885
If you see a stranger
and have some doubt..

999
00:54:50,018 --> 00:54:51,649
- ..then shoot him.
- Don't worry sir.

1000
00:54:51,729 --> 00:54:51,805
Hey..

1001
00:55:03,061 --> 00:55:05,979
Look Siddharth,
you are friend of a friend.

1002
00:55:06,317 --> 00:55:08,658
I think you have
no idea of PR's power.

1003
00:55:08,738 --> 00:55:10,684
Don't put your life
in danger for someone else.

1004
00:55:10,764 --> 00:55:12,258
It is my habit to play with dangers.

1005
00:55:12,338 --> 00:55:13,493
Nothing will happen to me.

1006
00:55:13,825 --> 00:55:16,103
I guarantee that I
will get PR's daughter.

1007
00:55:16,183 --> 00:55:17,960
PR's younger brother-in-law
Nandu is my patient.

1008
00:55:18,004 --> 00:55:20,060
That is why I know how
dangerous that family is.

1009
00:55:20,176 --> 00:55:21,484
PR's brother-in-law.

1010
00:55:22,097 --> 00:55:22,923
Who is he?

1011
00:55:32,814 --> 00:55:33,967
What is his problem?

1012
00:55:34,092 --> 00:55:36,323
He has a habit if talking to ghosts.

1013
00:55:36,403 --> 00:55:37,755
He is very close to him..

1014
00:55:37,835 --> 00:55:39,909
..so that is why he has
been sent to me for treatment.

1015
00:55:50,172 --> 00:55:51,877
Tell him that he will be treated.

1016
00:55:52,336 --> 00:55:53,980
What is the matter doctor?
Why did you call me so urgently?

1017
00:55:54,006 --> 00:55:56,750
There is a treatment by which
your brother can be completely cured.

1018
00:55:56,884 --> 00:55:57,567
What are you saying?

1019
00:55:57,647 --> 00:56:01,013
In such cases if we make
the patient believe that..

1020
00:56:01,093 --> 00:56:03,988
..we believe in their
power of talking to ghosts.

1021
00:56:04,068 --> 00:56:05,891
Then they can become
positive and can be cured.

1022
00:56:05,971 --> 00:56:08,208
He is Dr. Siddhu, my friend.
He is a Psychiatrist.

1023
00:56:08,288 --> 00:56:09,815
Whenever Nandu will call a ghost..

1024
00:56:09,895 --> 00:56:11,577
..then he will become
a ghost and talk to him.

1025
00:56:11,657 --> 00:56:14,695
You and your family members have
to act as if you all cannot see him.

1026
00:56:15,117 --> 00:56:17,901
Then Nandu will believe
that he is talking to ghosts.

1027
00:56:17,981 --> 00:56:19,236
Then slowly,
slowly he will become fine.

1028
00:56:19,316 --> 00:56:21,505
I will do anything
for my brother, doctor.

1029
00:56:21,585 --> 00:56:22,357
- Listen, Vipin..
- Yes sir.

1030
00:56:22,437 --> 00:56:23,492
Get Nandu.

1031
00:56:26,655 --> 00:56:27,693
How are you Nandu?

1032
00:56:27,088 --> 00:56:28,393
- Come, come..
- Hey.

1033
00:56:29,265 --> 00:56:30,410
I don't talk to anyone
except for ghosts.

1034
00:56:30,049 --> 00:56:32,100
That is why we have called you.
You are absolutely fine.

1035
00:56:32,621 --> 00:56:33,694
Now you can talk to any ghost.

1036
00:56:34,431 --> 00:56:37,297
Really. I love you doctor.
I will surely kiss you.

1037
00:56:37,091 --> 00:56:38,685
Sit down.

1038
00:56:39,584 --> 00:56:40,539
Okay, I am sitting.

1039
00:56:40,904 --> 00:56:42,515
- Keep it in front of you.
- Is this an ice ball?

1040
00:56:42,595 --> 00:56:43,888
It is a phone which will
help you to call ghosts.

1041
00:56:43,968 --> 00:56:44,641
But where is the number?

1042
00:56:44,721 --> 00:56:47,508
- This has voice calling features.
- What is it?

1043
00:56:47,588 --> 00:56:49,650
- If I will call then ghost
will come out of it. - Yes.

1044
00:56:49,073 --> 00:56:51,357
But I do not know
anyone at personal level.

1045
00:56:52,094 --> 00:56:54,056
He has sent you friend
request on facebook.

1046
00:56:54,136 --> 00:56:55,633
Is this handsome alive or dead?

1047
00:56:55,713 --> 00:56:58,030
He has just died. He has died young
so that is why he is looking smart.

1048
00:56:58,011 --> 00:56:59,708
Girl friend left her so
that is why he committed suiide.

1049
00:56:59,887 --> 00:57:01,572
His name is Siddhu.
If you wish you can talk to him.

1050
00:57:01,652 --> 00:57:03,814
You have found a handsome ghost.
I will just invite him.

1051
00:57:03,894 --> 00:57:05,989
- Okay, call.
- My nice ghost.

1052
00:57:06,069 --> 00:57:07,122
Siddhu, please come here.

1053
00:57:07,679 --> 00:57:11,761
Yes, come on Siddhu.
I have dialed your name.

1054
00:57:11,841 --> 00:57:12,907
Come in my network area.

1055
00:57:13,581 --> 00:57:15,258
Siddhu...

1056
00:57:17,014 --> 00:57:19,699
- Did you call me, Nandu?
- He is the one.

1057
00:57:19,905 --> 00:57:20,807
You said the truth.

1058
00:57:20,887 --> 00:57:22,474
- My true friend has come.
- He cannot be seen.

1059
00:57:22,554 --> 00:57:25,131
Only my true friends can see me.

1060
00:57:25,211 --> 00:57:26,285
Sister, look that
man is talking to me.

1061
00:57:27,031 --> 00:57:28,067
I cannot hear.

1062
00:57:28,471 --> 00:57:30,293
You cannot hear. Only I can hear him.

1063
00:57:30,373 --> 00:57:31,795
- Are you happy now?
- Yes, very, very happy.

1064
00:57:31,875 --> 00:57:33,386
- Then let's go home.
- You too come with us.

1065
00:57:33,466 --> 00:57:35,205
Just remember your
friend and I will come.

1066
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:37,108
- Bye.
- Bye soul mate.

1067
00:57:38,818 --> 00:57:39,766
Let's go home Nandu.

1068
00:57:39,846 --> 00:57:41,143
- Yes, let's go home.
- Now you are fine.

1069
00:57:41,223 --> 00:57:42,174
- Thank you doctor.
- Okay..

1070
00:57:42,254 --> 00:57:44,083
- Thank you. Give me one kiss.
- What are you doing?

1071
00:57:44,163 --> 00:57:45,595
- Fine okay. Bye, bye..
- Go..

1072
00:57:45,747 --> 00:57:46,810
- Take this with you.
- I'm taking this home.

1073
00:57:46,089 --> 00:57:47,164
- Go, run away from here.
- Let's go.

1074
00:57:48,045 --> 00:57:48,940
Thank you doctor.

1075
00:57:50,573 --> 00:57:51,749
- Greetings madam.
- Greeting.

1076
00:57:51,829 --> 00:57:54,046
Why did you get the younger sir?
From today Nandu will stay at home.

1077
00:57:54,126 --> 00:57:57,948
Whenever he says that he can talk to
ghosts then you all have to say yes.

1078
00:57:58,028 --> 00:58:01,304
As soon as he gets cured we will get
him married to Babu Hatela's daughter.

1079
00:58:01,384 --> 00:58:02,792
This is great news.

1080
00:58:02,872 --> 00:58:05,234
Today Nandu's doctor Siddharth
is going to come home.

1081
00:58:05,314 --> 00:58:07,629
When he comes then let
him come inside. Understood.

1082
00:58:16,014 --> 00:58:19,280
Hey, Pappu,
Goliya, Bipin..everyone come here.

1083
00:58:19,486 --> 00:58:20,658
Hey, who are you?

1084
00:58:20,738 --> 00:58:24,477
Shiva, wait. Wait.
Madam had called this doctor.

1085
00:58:24,557 --> 00:58:26,635
- Okay, go inside.
- Come with me.

1086
00:58:28,796 --> 00:58:31,902
Siddhu, my dear ghost, come out.

1087
00:58:31,982 --> 00:58:34,490
Which ghost are you talking about?
I cannot see anything.

1088
00:58:34,629 --> 00:58:36,096
Come..

1089
00:58:37,196 --> 00:58:38,960
- He has come.
- Brother, look the ghost has come.

1090
00:58:39,389 --> 00:58:41,115
Hey, only I can see this ghost.

1091
00:58:41,195 --> 00:58:42,644
We cannot see the ghost.

1092
00:58:43,018 --> 00:58:46,221
You are right,
we cannot see anyone sir.

1093
00:58:46,301 --> 00:58:48,684
- Okay, okay.
- You called me, Nandu.

1094
00:58:48,764 --> 00:58:51,472
- Hey goons party, meet him.
- Younger sir.

1095
00:58:51,552 --> 00:58:53,754
He is Siddhu.
My ghost friend.

1096
00:58:53,834 --> 00:58:55,389
Which ghost, sir? We cannot see.

1097
00:58:55,469 --> 00:58:57,932
What are you talking bloody fool.
Only I can see him.

1098
00:58:58,012 --> 00:58:59,450
- Come, I will make you drink juice.
- Let's go.

1099
00:58:59,053 --> 00:59:01,665
Who else lives in such
a big house other than you?

1100
00:59:02,222 --> 00:59:04,451
Why are you asking?
The ghost knows everything.

1101
00:59:04,531 --> 00:59:07,452
- Every ghost has a different
general knowledge. - Sir, juice.

1102
00:59:07,532 --> 00:59:09,099
- Thank you.
- Even you take, sir.

1103
00:59:09,535 --> 00:59:11,673
What are you doing?
Only I can see him..

1104
00:59:11,753 --> 00:59:14,094
..then how can you
give juice to the ghost?

1105
00:59:14,223 --> 00:59:15,791
What are you saying? I can see no one.

1106
00:59:15,871 --> 00:59:16,964
You just offered him.

1107
00:59:17,044 --> 00:59:19,280
Mother had said than a
ghost is going to come with you.

1108
00:59:19,036 --> 00:59:20,380
That is why without
seeing extended my hand.

1109
00:59:20,784 --> 00:59:22,268
Okay, Okay.. Give, give..

1110
00:59:23,968 --> 00:59:26,111
Look..oh God...how the
glass is flying in the air.

1111
00:59:26,191 --> 00:59:27,466
- Really?
- Mahima..

1112
00:59:27,546 --> 00:59:29,615
- Yes madam.
- Is the food for younger madam ready?

1113
00:59:29,695 --> 00:59:31,944
- I will just get.
- Hurry up and get it.

1114
00:59:33,293 --> 00:59:36,157
Shall I ask you one thing?
Who is this younger madam?

1115
00:59:36,237 --> 00:59:39,731
She is my niece. Few days ago she
ran from the canopy of her marriage.

1116
00:59:39,811 --> 00:59:42,432
That is why she is locked in the
room and there is security outside.

1117
00:59:43,478 --> 00:59:45,260
- Can I meet her once?
- Not at all.

1118
00:59:45,034 --> 00:59:46,985
No one can go in that room except me.

1119
00:59:47,518 --> 00:59:50,195
But I am a ghost.
No one else except you can see me.

1120
00:59:50,275 --> 00:59:51,606
You are right. Come.

1121
00:59:51,966 --> 00:59:52,059
Come inside.

1122
00:59:54,524 --> 00:59:55,597
Niece..

1123
01:00:09,035 --> 01:00:10,101
Why do you seem to be so shocked?

1124
01:00:10,775 --> 01:00:13,863
Okay, you did not know that I
have come back home from the hospital.

1125
01:00:13,943 --> 01:00:17,305
Do you know who has come with me?
My ghost friend Siddhu.

1126
01:00:19,762 --> 01:00:22,048
You will not be able to see him.

1127
01:00:22,309 --> 01:00:23,587
Oh no, Tarzan here.

1128
01:00:23,667 --> 01:00:26,393
If he sees me here then
he will again send me to hospital.

1129
01:00:26,473 --> 01:00:27,772
- Let's go.
- You go. He cannot see me.

1130
01:00:27,852 --> 01:00:29,538
You are right. I will leave.

1131
01:00:34,737 --> 01:00:37,758
Siddharth,
I had left all hopes to meet you.

1132
01:00:38,027 --> 01:00:39,525
I had got so scared.

1133
01:00:40,031 --> 01:00:41,238
I love you Siddharth.

1134
01:00:46,935 --> 01:00:48,529
Shelja, this PR..

1135
01:00:48,609 --> 01:00:49,630
He is my father.

1136
01:00:50,113 --> 01:00:51,204
Then who is Bauji?

1137
01:00:52,714 --> 01:00:54,402
How do you know about Bauji?

1138
01:00:58,221 --> 01:01:00,662
I think he has sent
you here by cheating you.

1139
01:01:01,881 --> 01:01:04,122
Many years ago he used
to work with my father.

1140
01:01:04,202 --> 01:01:08,461
When he earned some money then he
asked my hand in marriage for his son.

1141
01:01:08,732 --> 01:01:11,284
That day my father insulted him a lot.

1142
01:01:11,461 --> 01:01:15,439
From that day he plays games
to get me married to his son.

1143
01:01:15,519 --> 01:01:18,971
Siddharth, father has promised chief
minister to get me married to his son.

1144
01:01:19,051 --> 01:01:21,318
I was about to tell
you everything on the phone.

1145
01:01:21,398 --> 01:01:23,825
But my father snatched
my phone from me.

1146
01:01:24,136 --> 01:01:25,144
Don't take tension.

1147
01:01:25,404 --> 01:01:27,645
- This marriage will not take place.
- Why don't you understand?

1148
01:01:27,725 --> 01:01:30,579
My father is more dangerous
than your thinking.

1149
01:01:30,895 --> 01:01:32,910
I can do anything for you.

1150
01:01:39,973 --> 01:01:41,367
Siddharth..

1151
01:02:11,988 --> 01:02:15,132
Hey..

1152
01:02:41,313 --> 01:02:43,876
- Who are you?
- Love of your daughter.

1153
01:02:43,956 --> 01:02:45,264
Son-in-law of this house.

1154
01:02:46,725 --> 01:02:50,594
I am a kind man so I am
telling you and then taking her.

1155
01:02:51,136 --> 01:02:55,474
Hey, you came inside alive
because your luck was good.

1156
01:02:55,554 --> 01:02:57,123
Now you will go out dead.

1157
01:02:57,203 --> 01:02:59,104
Okay, so you will thrash me.

1158
01:02:59,184 --> 01:03:00,887
It is not easy to thrash me.

1159
01:03:00,967 --> 01:03:03,736
Whenever I wish I
can go out from here.

1160
01:03:04,536 --> 01:03:06,360
You have entered
into a dangerous place..

1161
01:03:06,044 --> 01:03:07,090
..so you cannot go alive from here.

1162
01:03:07,098 --> 01:03:09,303
No one has the courage to stop me.

1163
01:03:10,521 --> 01:03:12,660
Once I get determined then
you will not be able to do anything.

1164
01:03:13,763 --> 01:03:18,005
Father-in-law, your daughter loves
me and she cannot belong to anyone.

1165
01:03:18,132 --> 01:03:21,153
It is better if you give
your daughter's hand in my hand.

1166
01:03:21,422 --> 01:03:22,587
Hey.

1167
01:03:33,712 --> 01:03:36,777
Hey, there is a line of cars outside..

1168
01:03:37,013 --> 01:03:39,020
..and choose the car you want.

1169
01:03:39,038 --> 01:03:41,577
The petrol tanks of
my cars are always full.

1170
01:03:41,999 --> 01:03:44,021
Drive as fast as you can.

1171
01:03:44,299 --> 01:03:47,301
Seeing the number of my car
no police officer will stop you.

1172
01:03:47,046 --> 01:03:50,754
Today is Saturday and
a very auspicious day.

1173
01:03:51,304 --> 01:03:53,438
If your love is true
and you have courage then..

1174
01:03:53,518 --> 01:03:56,079
..take my daughter out of the city.

1175
01:03:56,159 --> 01:04:00,391
Great father-in-law. by giving such a
great offer you have really helped me.

1176
01:04:00,054 --> 01:04:02,850
Not only till the border of the
city I will take her till my house.

1177
01:04:12,607 --> 01:04:15,658
Father-in-law,
play well whatever game plan you have.

1178
01:04:16,627 --> 01:04:19,854
Because I am that player
who has never accepted defeat.

1179
01:05:18,671 --> 01:05:20,729
Hey..

1180
01:05:35,297 --> 01:05:38,182
Hey, he is escaping.
Everyone sit in your cars quickly.

1181
01:05:43,691 --> 01:05:45,649
Hey, he has gone mad.

1182
01:06:49,539 --> 01:06:49,638
Damn it!

1183
01:06:50,687 --> 01:06:53,642
Brother, he is not an ordinary man.

1184
01:06:53,722 --> 01:06:55,310
Did you ask for help from CM?

1185
01:06:55,039 --> 01:06:57,173
No. it is matter
of dignity of the house.

1186
01:06:57,698 --> 01:06:59,940
No one should come to know about it.

1187
01:07:00,002 --> 01:07:02,034
If CM comes to know then
he will cancel the marriage.

1188
01:07:02,519 --> 01:07:05,583
Go Tirupati and without
wasting any time kill that fellow.

1189
01:07:06,239 --> 01:07:07,632
And bring Shelja back.

1190
01:07:10,596 --> 01:07:12,423
Thank God we came out of one tension.

1191
01:07:12,503 --> 01:07:13,561
Actual tension will start now.

1192
01:07:14,163 --> 01:07:14,774
What?

1193
01:07:14,854 --> 01:07:17,480
My father does not like
violence and violent people.

1194
01:07:18,289 --> 01:07:20,586
I will have to think of a
new plan to take you to my house.

1195
01:07:21,007 --> 01:07:22,799
You sleep by keeping
your head on my shoulder.

1196
01:07:23,499 --> 01:07:26,405
- I will think about it.
- I am feeling very restless Siddharth.

1197
01:07:32,092 --> 01:07:34,361
- Hi aunt.
- What is this?

1198
01:07:34,441 --> 01:07:36,907
Why did you come through the window?
Can't you come through the main door?

1199
01:07:36,987 --> 01:07:39,806
Single and unmarried come through
door but I am double and in pair.

1200
01:07:39,886 --> 01:07:40,761
Pair..

1201
01:07:43,633 --> 01:07:45,452
Greet her. Join your hands.

1202
01:07:45,532 --> 01:07:47,313
Greetings aunt.

1203
01:07:47,826 --> 01:07:48,663
Greetings..

1204
01:07:48,743 --> 01:07:51,832
I fell in love with
this girl in the train.

1205
01:07:52,484 --> 01:07:53,681
I shall pick her
up and you pull her in.

1206
01:07:54,456 --> 01:07:56,131
Go, go..

1207
01:07:56,211 --> 01:07:57,673
Priyanka..

1208
01:08:01,175 --> 01:08:02,189
Who is this girl?

1209
01:08:02,395 --> 01:08:03,699
Sister, first come and help me..

1210
01:08:03,779 --> 01:08:04,684
- ..and then I will tell you.
- Okay, I will do it.

1211
01:08:04,764 --> 01:08:05,879
- Come..
- Please help me.

1212
01:08:06,405 --> 01:08:09,444
You very well know what will happen if
your father comes to know about this.

1213
01:08:09,524 --> 01:08:11,708
Go and drop this
girl to her house. Go.

1214
01:08:11,788 --> 01:08:13,734
Mother, it is my responsibility
to make him understand.

1215
01:08:13,814 --> 01:08:16,379
In his eyes I will prove Shailja to be
a daughter-in-law with moral values.

1216
01:08:16,459 --> 01:08:18,477
Then he will not be able to refuse.
I just need your help.

1217
01:08:18,557 --> 01:08:21,001
How will it happen?
It is not possible.

1218
01:08:21,803 --> 01:08:24,576
Aunty, please aunty..please aunty..

1219
01:08:24,656 --> 01:08:26,745
Always remain happy, child.
What should I do now?

1220
01:08:26,825 --> 01:08:29,357
Don't take tension. Let her
stay here for some days, mother.

1221
01:08:29,437 --> 01:08:31,359
Leave the rest on your capable son.
My lovely mother.

1222
01:08:31,439 --> 01:08:34,813
They both look so good together.
Agree to this, sister.

1223
01:08:35,183 --> 01:08:36,014
Please.

1224
01:08:37,182 --> 01:08:37,270
Okay.

1225
01:08:38,142 --> 01:08:41,150
But what will we answer
if everyone asks us.

1226
01:08:42,933 --> 01:08:45,087
Idea. We will say that
she is relative of aunt.

1227
01:08:45,167 --> 01:08:47,932
No, no everyone knows my relatives.
No, not at all.

1228
01:08:48,934 --> 01:08:50,479
He has again forgotten his phone.

1229
01:08:51,568 --> 01:08:52,086
Hello.

1230
01:08:52,166 --> 01:08:55,193
This is me Perfume Prasad
by spraying perfume..

1231
01:08:55,273 --> 01:08:57,000
..calling all the way from Dubai.

1232
01:08:57,008 --> 01:08:58,917
- Yes tell me.
- Is this Rama Rao's number?

1233
01:08:59,069 --> 01:09:00,073
No, he has gone to the bank.

1234
01:09:00,189 --> 01:09:03,726
It has been 20 years since I met him.
Tell him that I had called.

1235
01:09:03,806 --> 01:09:05,258
I will come and meet him
next week by spraying perfume.

1236
01:09:05,338 --> 01:09:06,380
Okay, I will tell him.

1237
01:09:06,046 --> 01:09:06,915
Who's phone call was it aunt?

1238
01:09:07,409 --> 01:09:09,764
The call was from your
uncle's friend Perfume Prasad.

1239
01:09:09,844 --> 01:09:12,842
Every time he says that he
will come to meet him next week..

1240
01:09:12,922 --> 01:09:15,255
..but 20years have
passed and he has not come.

1241
01:09:16,243 --> 01:09:17,376
Your uncle has come.

1242
01:09:17,519 --> 01:09:20,522
- Go quickly and hide her somewhere.
- Come on hurry up.

1243
01:09:21,046 --> 01:09:22,823
Go and hide here.

1244
01:09:23,869 --> 01:09:24,927
- Siddharth, Siddharth..
- What happened?

1245
01:09:25,007 --> 01:09:26,293
- Priyanka..
- He is coming to this side.

1246
01:09:26,614 --> 01:09:27,619
- Now he will surely come in the room.
- Now I cannot do anything.

1247
01:09:28,194 --> 01:09:29,865
- You are a hot wife so do something.
- But what will I do?

1248
01:09:29,945 --> 01:09:30,501
Where is the phone?

1249
01:09:30,581 --> 01:09:31,779
- Since long I am finding it.
- Listen..

1250
01:09:35,824 --> 01:09:36,876
What has happened?

1251
01:09:40,097 --> 01:09:42,062
What has happened to you today?

1252
01:09:42,142 --> 01:09:44,853
When did we last made love?

1253
01:09:44,933 --> 01:09:45,636
Even I don't remember.

1254
01:09:45,716 --> 01:09:47,354
When did I last moved
fingers in your hair?

1255
01:09:47,759 --> 01:09:50,155
When did we last sing a duet song?

1256
01:09:50,235 --> 01:09:52,248
Listen. Sing a romantic song.

1257
01:09:52,328 --> 01:09:54,617
- I do not know how to sing.
- Sing..

1258
01:09:54,697 --> 01:09:59,766
"A girl meets me every day."

1259
01:10:00,078 --> 01:10:04,999
"A girl meets me every day."

1260
01:10:05,177 --> 01:10:10,189
"She is crazy about me
and I am crazy about her."

1261
01:10:26,278 --> 01:10:29,032
Come closer. Give me a kiss my dear.

1262
01:10:31,378 --> 01:10:32,469
Why did you slap me?
Brother, it is you..

1263
01:10:33,368 --> 01:10:35,101
Leaving the ATM line
you are dancing here.

1264
01:10:35,181 --> 01:10:37,890
- Why were you standing in ATM line?
- Go, you forgetful person.

1265
01:10:37,097 --> 01:10:40,095
The note of 500 did not change
then how did the partner change?

1266
01:10:41,048 --> 01:10:42,740
Somehow we managed yesterday.

1267
01:10:42,082 --> 01:10:44,320
Because of you all I
will get high BP, low BP..

1268
01:10:45,138 --> 01:10:46,194
- ..asthma, heart attack
and everything else.. - Aunty..

1269
01:10:46,778 --> 01:10:48,614
When will the medical
insurance come into use?

1270
01:10:48,925 --> 01:10:51,603
- Where is your husband?
- He is getting ready for office.

1271
01:10:51,811 --> 01:10:52,593
I have a great idea.

1272
01:10:52,673 --> 01:10:53,630
- Which idea?
- We will say that she is daughter of..

1273
01:10:53,071 --> 01:10:55,122
..uncle's Dubai friend Perfume Prasad.

1274
01:10:56,654 --> 01:10:58,223
- Great idea.
- This cannot happen.

1275
01:10:58,303 --> 01:11:00,464
You know uncle well.
He is a very truthful person.

1276
01:11:00,544 --> 01:11:01,609
- He will never agree.
- Yes, this is a problem.

1277
01:11:02,274 --> 01:11:03,441
- Let's do one thing.
- What?

1278
01:11:03,521 --> 01:11:04,853
Come closer and listen to me.

1279
01:11:05,395 --> 01:11:07,764
Uncle is forgetful so we
will take advantage of that. Okay.

1280
01:11:07,844 --> 01:11:08,616
Yes.

1281
01:11:09,004 --> 01:11:11,112
Priyanaka, half an hour
ago I had asked for coffee.

1282
01:11:11,192 --> 01:11:12,629
You have already had coffee.

1283
01:11:12,972 --> 01:11:13,813
I have already drunk it.

1284
01:11:15,192 --> 01:11:17,267
I have just had a bath.
When did I drink coffee?

1285
01:11:17,347 --> 01:11:19,351
Why are you troubling everyone?

1286
01:11:19,827 --> 01:11:21,668
The empty cup is kept in front of you.

1287
01:11:24,557 --> 01:11:26,583
Call Siddharth. He needed money.

1288
01:11:26,669 --> 01:11:27,675
What is it uncle?

1289
01:11:27,868 --> 01:11:30,011
- Hey, you needed 5,000/-
- You have already given me?

1290
01:11:30,091 --> 01:11:32,280
- When did I give?
- Just few minutes ago you gave him.

1291
01:11:32,745 --> 01:11:33,929
Just check your wallet.

1292
01:11:36,864 --> 01:11:37,911
5,000/- are less.

1293
01:11:39,118 --> 01:11:40,900
What is this?
Why are children at home?

1294
01:11:40,098 --> 01:11:40,871
Why have they not gone to school?

1295
01:11:41,833 --> 01:11:44,776
The teacher had told you that
today there is a holiday in school.

1296
01:11:45,473 --> 01:11:48,772
Yes, I remember.
Your principal had called and told me.

1297
01:11:48,852 --> 01:11:49,818
- Go and play.
- Yeah!

1298
01:11:49,898 --> 01:11:51,166
- Children are true at heart.
- Uncle..

1299
01:11:51,246 --> 01:11:52,437
Tiffin box is ready.
Shall I keep it in the bag?

1300
01:11:52,517 --> 01:11:53,648
Okay fine. Keep it.

1301
01:11:54,253 --> 01:11:56,796
- Who is this girl?
- You did not recognize me.

1302
01:11:56,876 --> 01:11:58,975
You had brought me here, uncle.

1303
01:11:59,055 --> 01:12:01,489
And now you are refusing
to recognize me.

1304
01:12:01,569 --> 01:12:05,308
If you were to make me a stranger
then why did you get me here.

1305
01:12:06,713 --> 01:12:08,685
Okay, I will leave from here.

1306
01:12:08,092 --> 01:12:09,223
You had told us uncle that..

1307
01:12:10,131 --> 01:12:11,542
..she is daughter of
your friend Perfume Prasad.

1308
01:12:11,622 --> 01:12:12,953
You had said that she
would stay here for a week.

1309
01:12:13,033 --> 01:12:14,204
And now you are asking who she is.

1310
01:12:14,386 --> 01:12:15,925
- Perfume Prasad's daughter..
- Yes.

1311
01:12:16,005 --> 01:12:16,940
- I brought her here.
- Yes.

1312
01:12:17,002 --> 01:12:18,914
You had said that she has to
come to India for some job interview.

1313
01:12:19,012 --> 01:12:21,877
Really. You remember all that I said.

1314
01:12:21,957 --> 01:12:24,962
- But I do not remember anything.
- You have become forgetful.

1315
01:12:26,411 --> 01:12:28,169
What is the matter Rama Rao?
Don't you want to go to office?

1316
01:12:28,249 --> 01:12:29,788
I am just leaving.

1317
01:12:32,043 --> 01:12:32,887
Who is she?

1318
01:12:32,967 --> 01:12:34,533
Do you remember my
friend Perfume Prasad?

1319
01:12:34,613 --> 01:12:35,515
- Yes.
- She is her daughter.

1320
01:12:35,595 --> 01:12:36,612
The one who stays in Dubai.

1321
01:12:36,692 --> 01:12:39,136
Yes brother. She has come
here for an interview for job.

1322
01:12:39,216 --> 01:12:40,890
She will stay in our house.

1323
01:12:42,125 --> 01:12:43,198
What is her name?

1324
01:12:43,088 --> 01:12:44,997
Why are you looking at me?
you had said that she is Shelja.

1325
01:12:45,949 --> 01:12:47,804
- Shelja.
- Which degree has she passed in?

1326
01:12:48,933 --> 01:12:50,511
How much do you forget?
She is doing engineering.

1327
01:12:50,591 --> 01:12:51,563
Engineering, engineering...

1328
01:12:51,643 --> 01:12:53,369
Why do you ask everything from him?

1329
01:12:53,673 --> 01:12:55,981
Because of you even I
will become a forgetful person.

1330
01:12:56,618 --> 01:12:58,677
Look child.
Consider this as your own house.

1331
01:12:59,288 --> 01:13:01,936
Don't hesitate. Ask whatever you want.

1332
01:13:02,645 --> 01:13:03,580
Thanks uncle.

1333
01:13:03,907 --> 01:13:05,291
- Siddharth..
- Tell me uncle.

1334
01:13:05,371 --> 01:13:08,523
Whatever you said I agreed but to
be honest I do not remember anything.

1335
01:13:08,603 --> 01:13:10,532
I eat 5 almonds after
getting up in the morning.

1336
01:13:10,612 --> 01:13:12,486
Uncle, if you don't mind
then shall I tell you a secret?

1337
01:13:12,566 --> 01:13:13,272
Tell me.

1338
01:13:13,352 --> 01:13:15,525
I think you have got Alzheimer.

1339
01:13:15,074 --> 01:13:16,253
- Alzheimer?
- Yes.

1340
01:13:17,102 --> 01:13:18,458
Is this the name of a dry fruit?

1341
01:13:18,538 --> 01:13:20,500
This is not the name
of dry fruit but of a disease.

1342
01:13:20,058 --> 01:13:22,242
In this the brain starts
getting dry and stops thinking.

1343
01:13:22,844 --> 01:13:24,431
Can't we put water in the brain?

1344
01:13:24,511 --> 01:13:26,383
Of course you can.
Along with that add dry cow dung..

1345
01:13:26,463 --> 01:13:27,824
..and if growth does not
happen then keep asking others.

1346
01:13:27,904 --> 01:13:29,197
- It is better to ask anyone else.
- Yes.

1347
01:13:29,277 --> 01:13:30,536
- My memory card has become corrupt.
- Completely.

1348
01:13:30,616 --> 01:13:32,108
- Tell me what should I do?
- Go to the office.

1349
01:13:32,188 --> 01:13:32,933
- Okay.
- Yes.

1350
01:13:33,619 --> 01:13:35,164
- What was the name of the disease?
- Alzheimer.

1351
01:13:35,244 --> 01:13:36,280
Alzheimer.

1352
01:13:38,084 --> 01:13:39,739
Think that this mall belongs to you.

1353
01:13:39,819 --> 01:13:41,583
Pick up whatever you
need for the marriage.

1354
01:13:41,663 --> 01:13:43,371
Why to do shopping when marriage
is not going to take place?

1355
01:13:43,451 --> 01:13:44,577
Keep quiet.

1356
01:13:44,744 --> 01:13:46,221
If you talk nonsense
then I will not spare you.

1357
01:13:46,301 --> 01:13:48,568
Brother, I don't think so he will
be able to get that PR's daughter.

1358
01:13:48,648 --> 01:13:50,185
He is a true man.
He will surely get her.

1359
01:13:50,265 --> 01:13:53,096
What is the guarantee?
Agree to me and call him.

1360
01:13:53,176 --> 01:13:54,224
Hurry up, hurry up.

1361
01:13:56,289 --> 01:13:57,756
Who has called now?

1362
01:13:58,525 --> 01:14:00,479
- Hello...
- Hello, It's me speaking.

1363
01:14:00,559 --> 01:14:02,710
Did you enter PR's house or not?

1364
01:14:02,971 --> 01:14:05,545
Bauji, I always make
true promises and do as I say.

1365
01:14:05,625 --> 01:14:06,663
Very good.

1366
01:14:07,343 --> 01:14:08,129
He is here.

1367
01:14:08,209 --> 01:14:10,863
Tell me one thing.
I hope no one had a doubt on you.

1368
01:14:10,943 --> 01:14:12,486
No one has doubt here..

1369
01:14:12,566 --> 01:14:14,550
..but I think you have a doubt
on me so that is why you have called.

1370
01:14:15,342 --> 01:14:17,421
- Senseless..go away from here.
- Why are you hitting me?

1371
01:14:19,875 --> 01:14:22,449
That is not the case.
My men were worried about you..

1372
01:14:22,529 --> 01:14:23,806
..that whether you
are safe there or not.

1373
01:14:23,886 --> 01:14:26,895
Till now I was. Luckily my phone
was on vibration mode when you called.

1374
01:14:26,975 --> 01:14:29,917
If it would have rung then PR would
have come to know and thrashed me.

1375
01:14:29,997 --> 01:14:33,571
Don't call unnecessarily otherwise
the situation will become imbalance.

1376
01:14:33,651 --> 01:14:34,894
Understood. Keep the phone.

1377
01:14:37,563 --> 01:14:39,196
- Sir, the phone is ringing.
- Whose call is it?

1378
01:14:39,276 --> 01:14:43,542
- It is CM's.
- Oh no...

1379
01:14:45,224 --> 01:14:47,231
Yes, tell me.

1380
01:14:47,427 --> 01:14:50,693
Nothing much.
My son wants to talk to your daughter.

1381
01:14:50,773 --> 01:14:51,822
Give the phone to her.

1382
01:14:52,891 --> 01:14:54,778
Hello PR, hello...

1383
01:14:55,847 --> 01:14:58,266
Brother, she has gone to
the market and must be on her way.

1384
01:14:58,836 --> 01:15:00,020
I will give you a call
as soon as she is back.

1385
01:15:00,001 --> 01:15:01,304
Whom are you lying to?

1386
01:15:01,547 --> 01:15:04,459
She has not gone to the market
but has eloped with her lover.

1387
01:15:04,629 --> 01:15:06,646
Whenever I call you make a new excuse.

1388
01:15:07,149 --> 01:15:09,193
Look, I agreed to
this marriage proposal..

1389
01:15:09,669 --> 01:15:11,444
..because of insistence of my son.

1390
01:15:11,666 --> 01:15:13,177
But now that relationship is over.

1391
01:15:13,442 --> 01:15:15,839
Giving my reference you
have become king of Kolkatta.

1392
01:15:15,919 --> 01:15:17,766
From today your relation
with me is over.

1393
01:15:17,846 --> 01:15:19,825
Brother, listen to me. Hello..

1394
01:15:19,905 --> 01:15:20,689
Get lost.

1395
01:15:20,817 --> 01:15:21,913
Shit!

1396
01:15:25,793 --> 01:15:27,232
- Sujata...
- Yes.

1397
01:15:27,312 --> 01:15:29,048
Where is the book that
had prayers written in it?

1398
01:15:29,128 --> 01:15:30,156
I am not able to find it.

1399
01:15:30,488 --> 01:15:31,969
Search it properly. It must be there.

1400
01:15:32,049 --> 01:15:33,724
- Where is it?
- Start..

1401
01:15:33,804 --> 01:15:48,555
'Religious song'

1402
01:15:48,635 --> 01:15:58,448
'Religious song'

1403
01:15:58,621 --> 01:16:10,395
'Religious song'

1404
01:16:46,008 --> 01:16:49,597
Your parents are very lucky, child.

1405
01:16:54,194 --> 01:16:55,470
Superb.

1406
01:16:55,633 --> 01:16:57,909
Son-in-law,
I want to talk something with you.

1407
01:16:58,047 --> 01:17:00,434
I want your suggestion
regarding Siddharth.

1408
01:17:00,953 --> 01:17:02,366
From the time Shelja has come..

1409
01:17:02,446 --> 01:17:05,222
..there has been a lot of
change in Siddharth's behavior.

1410
01:17:06,066 --> 01:17:08,543
It would make a difference
as both love each other.

1411
01:17:09,988 --> 01:17:11,016
- What?
- Yes.

1412
01:17:12,361 --> 01:17:15,226
I mean something needs to be done
so that this change remains forever.

1413
01:17:15,306 --> 01:17:17,932
And he forgets the girl from Tirupati.

1414
01:17:18,012 --> 01:17:19,703
- Oh.
- We are saved.

1415
01:17:19,783 --> 01:17:23,004
To be honest Shelja
won everyone's heart.

1416
01:17:23,084 --> 01:17:26,036
It would be great if she becomes
daughter-in-law of our house.

1417
01:17:26,116 --> 01:17:26,952
- Rama Rao..
- Yes brother.

1418
01:17:27,032 --> 01:17:28,569
Her father is your friend.

1419
01:17:28,649 --> 01:17:31,807
Yes. The girl's name is Shelja and is
daughter of my friend Perfume Prasad.

1420
01:17:31,887 --> 01:17:33,103
He stays in Dubai and she
has come here to give interview.

1421
01:17:33,183 --> 01:17:33,700
Quiet.

1422
01:17:33,078 --> 01:17:35,439
Call him up quickly.
I need to talk to him.

1423
01:17:36,707 --> 01:17:37,711
Okay.

1424
01:17:38,466 --> 01:17:40,492
Brother, he has called.

1425
01:17:40,736 --> 01:17:42,009
- Hello, Rama Rao
- Yes.

1426
01:17:42,089 --> 01:17:43,996
I came here today morning
after spraying perfume.

1427
01:17:44,076 --> 01:17:44,710
Great.

1428
01:17:44,079 --> 01:17:45,314
- Here...
- I am staying at Sunside Resort..

1429
01:17:46,105 --> 01:17:47,783
..so come and meet me.

1430
01:17:47,863 --> 01:17:50,546
Not only me but all my family
members will come and meet you.

1431
01:17:50,626 --> 01:17:51,528
There is good news.

1432
01:17:51,608 --> 01:17:53,303
- What kind of good news?
- Not on the phone.

1433
01:17:53,383 --> 01:17:54,485
I will personally come and tell you.

1434
01:17:54,565 --> 01:17:57,332
Brother, he has come here
and is staying in Sunside Resort.

1435
01:17:57,412 --> 01:17:58,971
Good. Let's go ad meet him today.

1436
01:18:03,588 --> 01:18:06,655
Father-in-law today is an auspicious
day but tomorrow is even better.

1437
01:18:07,338 --> 01:18:08,245
That is why we will go tomorrow.

1438
01:18:08,325 --> 01:18:10,379
We all will go tomorrow
for this auspicious matter.

1439
01:18:10,459 --> 01:18:11,138
Okay.

1440
01:18:15,018 --> 01:18:16,905
Here I am in tension and
look what are you doing there.

1441
01:18:16,985 --> 01:18:18,748
- What happened? Why did you call me?
- There is a tension.

1442
01:18:18,828 --> 01:18:20,117
That Perfume Prasad has
suddenly come here from Dubai.

1443
01:18:20,197 --> 01:18:21,263
Oh no..This is very dangerous news.

1444
01:18:21,937 --> 01:18:22,960
- What we'll do now?
- If uncle goes and meet him..

1445
01:18:23,247 --> 01:18:24,701
..then I am sure our
marriage will be cancelled.

1446
01:18:24,781 --> 01:18:27,509
Listen to me. We will have to
arrange duplicate parents for Shelja.

1447
01:18:27,589 --> 01:18:28,726
They should look to be Dubai returned.

1448
01:18:28,806 --> 01:18:31,085
Parents so soon..
Yes, I know of an artist.

1449
01:18:31,165 --> 01:18:32,768
- Who is he?
- Actually they are duplicate artists.

1450
01:18:32,848 --> 01:18:35,857
Whenever a new movie is released
they make free make of it.

1451
01:18:36,018 --> 01:18:39,153
This movie is low budgeted.
And this is just shown in villages.

1452
01:18:39,233 --> 01:18:40,451
They will surely fit in this role.

1453
01:18:40,531 --> 01:18:42,386
- But are a little greedy for money.
- Let them be.

1454
01:18:42,466 --> 01:18:43,277
Call them whatever is the budget.

1455
01:18:50,084 --> 01:19:00,616
'Sanskrit shlok'

1456
01:19:04,157 --> 01:19:14,376
'Sanskrit shlok'

1457
01:19:56,746 --> 01:19:57,768
Very nice hairstyle.

1458
01:19:58,046 --> 01:19:59,084
By taking your tension every day..

1459
01:19:59,506 --> 01:20:01,722
..the condition of my
head has become like this.

1460
01:20:01,802 --> 01:20:03,125
- You..
- Hey..

1461
01:20:03,003 --> 01:20:04,601
An old man Katappa is staring at me..

1462
01:20:04,978 --> 01:20:07,471
..as if his wife has
come on honeymoon with me.

1463
01:20:07,551 --> 01:20:10,013
When will you tell
me about my family history?

1464
01:20:10,093 --> 01:20:12,657
Hey your brother is in jail and your
sister has been thrown out of the city.

1465
01:20:12,737 --> 01:20:13,662
Do you want to know anything else?

1466
01:20:13,742 --> 01:20:14,775
Where is the one who gave birth to me?

1467
01:20:14,855 --> 01:20:16,346
Look, she is choosing logs of woods.

1468
01:20:24,005 --> 01:20:25,036
- That female.
- Yes.

1469
01:20:25,278 --> 01:20:26,836
But she is my grandmother.

1470
01:20:26,916 --> 01:20:28,461
If the producer's cheque
had not got bounced..

1471
01:20:28,541 --> 01:20:30,728
..then would look like your younger
sister after getting facial done.

1472
01:20:30,808 --> 01:20:32,957
After stealing lighter
and burning woods burn..

1473
01:20:33,037 --> 01:20:35,041
..your father's enemy Devroo.

1474
01:20:35,517 --> 01:20:39,530
Sell his liver and kidney in the
market and we will celebrate at night.

1475
01:20:39,727 --> 01:20:40,522
You mean I.

1476
01:20:40,602 --> 01:20:42,203
Sevedo, son of Sahubali.

1477
01:20:42,283 --> 01:20:44,368
Sahubali, Sahubali..

1478
01:20:44,679 --> 01:20:46,348
Balaldeva..

1479
01:20:46,783 --> 01:20:48,244
What happened mother,
why are you shouting?

1480
01:20:48,324 --> 01:20:49,783
He is the stupid Balaldeva.

1481
01:20:49,863 --> 01:20:52,641
He is brother-in-law of producer
so he got the strong role.

1482
01:20:52,721 --> 01:20:55,113
- His entire family is useless.
- You keep quiet.

1483
01:20:55,028 --> 01:20:58,185
Baladeva, make preparation
of saving 50*100 fort.

1484
01:20:58,517 --> 01:21:00,513
- Go, change the costume.
- Are you mad?

1485
01:21:00,593 --> 01:21:03,260
This is not real fort but a false one.
Send the old man.

1486
01:21:03,034 --> 01:21:06,616
Hey, shall I only do fighting scene,
thrashing scene, comedy scene..

1487
01:21:07,002 --> 01:21:09,195
Till I do not get kissing
scene I will not do anything.

1488
01:21:09,275 --> 01:21:11,196
Enough Kattapa.. you have to go.

1489
01:21:18,385 --> 01:21:20,011
- Is he Hidamba's brother-in-law?
- Kalakedu.

1490
01:21:20,091 --> 01:21:22,094
He was born in a cowshed
and he smells of cow dung.

1491
01:21:22,174 --> 01:21:23,487
Send him to hell straight away.

1492
01:21:23,567 --> 01:21:26,160
He is the one who disliked my selfies.

1493
01:21:30,231 --> 01:21:31,285
Is he cursing?

1494
01:21:31,542 --> 01:21:33,639
He is saying that your
mother should be a model.

1495
01:21:33,719 --> 01:21:34,790
She should be sent
to contest of Miss India.

1496
01:21:36,089 --> 01:21:37,982
If you want then go and kill her.

1497
01:21:38,863 --> 01:21:39,755
You are most welcome.

1498
01:21:39,835 --> 01:21:40,752
He is saying to kill her first.

1499
01:21:41,674 --> 01:21:44,715
Hey Kalakhatta, I will kill you.

1500
01:21:44,795 --> 01:21:46,454
Hey, Basmati rice..

1501
01:21:46,534 --> 01:21:48,005
Hey, Basmati..

1502
01:21:48,085 --> 01:21:50,170
- Hey Basmati..
- Hey Basmati..

1503
01:21:51,342 --> 01:21:52,917
- Thank you. We will meet again.
- Thank you.

1504
01:21:52,997 --> 01:21:53,812
- Hi Jagan.
- Hi Chandu.

1505
01:21:53,892 --> 01:21:54,487
- You acted very well.
- How are you?

1506
01:21:54,567 --> 01:21:56,514
He is my friend Siddharth.

1507
01:21:56,684 --> 01:21:57,737
- Hello.
- Hello sir. Nice to meet you.

1508
01:21:57,817 --> 01:21:59,595
- I am Jagan, an actor.
- I am Brensta.

1509
01:21:59,675 --> 01:22:01,676
What a great performance? Where
is the movie going to be released?

1510
01:22:01,756 --> 01:22:02,837
It is going to be
dubbed in many languages.

1511
01:22:03,646 --> 01:22:04,728
You are surely going
to make a profit of 300crores.

1512
01:22:04,808 --> 01:22:07,894
Because of short memory we all
have a habit of forgetting dialogues.

1513
01:22:08,748 --> 01:22:09,845
Okay. Your performance
was really fiery.

1514
01:22:10,798 --> 01:22:13,262
Tomorrow give such a great
performance in front of my family.

1515
01:22:13,462 --> 01:22:15,767
Very quickly change from
Sahubali to Perfume Prasad.

1516
01:22:15,847 --> 01:22:17,513
Just think that you are
talking to Perfume Prasad.

1517
01:22:17,593 --> 01:22:19,224
I shall become uncle
and she will become Aunt.

1518
01:22:19,304 --> 01:22:21,336
- Shall I show a trailer?
- Hey, this is live performance.

1519
01:22:21,069 --> 01:22:22,157
Sir, every emotion
ahs different rates.

1520
01:22:23,065 --> 01:22:25,049
After deducting TDS
online payment will be done

1521
01:22:39,045 --> 01:22:40,878
- Is this the acting group?
- Yes.

1522
01:22:41,459 --> 01:22:42,903
They look from Dongri
and not from Dubai.

1523
01:22:42,983 --> 01:22:44,767
Will Amitabh and Aishwarya
come for such small payment?

1524
01:22:44,847 --> 01:22:45,853
Remain in your character.

1525
01:22:46,613 --> 01:22:47,859
Does everyone remember the dialogues?

1526
01:22:48,087 --> 01:22:50,046
Leave dialogues and
see my performance.

1527
01:22:50,186 --> 01:22:51,378
- Siddharth..
- Yes uncle.

1528
01:22:51,458 --> 01:22:53,634
You had said that my
brain has stopped working.

1529
01:22:54,036 --> 01:22:56,377
Just tell me who Perfume Prasad is.

1530
01:22:56,457 --> 01:22:58,510
Whoever he is will recognize you?

1531
01:22:58,079 --> 01:22:59,038
- I understood.
- Good.

1532
01:22:59,829 --> 01:23:01,731
- Ramu..
-You were absolutely right.

1533
01:23:01,811 --> 01:23:03,282
Brother..

1534
01:23:06,491 --> 01:23:07,956
- Does he have Alzheimer too?
- One minute, one minute..

1535
01:23:08,036 --> 01:23:09,517
Ramu, I love you.

1536
01:23:09,597 --> 01:23:13,061
We have met after 20 years
but you are still the same.

1537
01:23:13,141 --> 01:23:13,849
- You haven't changed.
- Brother..

1538
01:23:13,929 --> 01:23:16,167
..we had brought a
basket of perfumes for you.

1539
01:23:16,247 --> 01:23:18,479
Do you know they finished on the way?

1540
01:23:20,081 --> 01:23:24,154
They make perfume and I
think while checking it got over.

1541
01:23:24,234 --> 01:23:26,076
What are you doing? I am Rama Rao.

1542
01:23:26,156 --> 01:23:28,718
So you got angry.
It has been 24hours since I am here..

1543
01:23:28,798 --> 01:23:30,241
..and you got time now to meet me.

1544
01:23:30,321 --> 01:23:31,713
I know that you are Rama Rao.

1545
01:23:31,793 --> 01:23:34,464
- So he was doing acting.
- Acting is our profession.

1546
01:23:34,544 --> 01:23:37,845
Will you do all the talking
standing out? Please come inside.

1547
01:23:38,931 --> 01:23:40,588
First you made a mistake
but don't do it now.

1548
01:23:40,668 --> 01:23:41,953
Don't take tension. I will manage.

1549
01:23:42,381 --> 01:23:44,569
My brother always talks about you all.

1550
01:23:44,649 --> 01:23:46,487
I heard about him for
the first time yesterday.

1551
01:23:48,647 --> 01:23:50,934
He means to say that yesterday
uncle talked about you.

1552
01:23:51,014 --> 01:23:52,403
- That is the case.
- Yes, yes..

1553
01:23:53,171 --> 01:23:55,126
- Your business?
- You mean mine.

1554
01:23:55,404 --> 01:23:57,073
Not only yours but of all of us.

1555
01:23:57,633 --> 01:23:58,908
Do you have separate business?

1556
01:23:59,352 --> 01:24:01,913
Ours is limited company
but hers is unlimited.

1557
01:24:01,993 --> 01:24:03,166
Unlimited?

1558
01:24:07,333 --> 01:24:09,305
Who is my daughter here?

1559
01:24:11,044 --> 01:24:12,701
To whom have you
given the role parents?

1560
01:24:12,896 --> 01:24:15,445
What do you mean?
You do not recognize your daughter.

1561
01:24:15,602 --> 01:24:16,437
What is this mother?

1562
01:24:16,517 --> 01:24:18,894
For few days I did not call
you and you have forgotten me.

1563
01:24:20,018 --> 01:24:21,967
Why are you standing, child?
Touch the feet of your father.

1564
01:24:22,209 --> 01:24:23,268
Yes.

1565
01:24:24,844 --> 01:24:27,033
Give blessings to
your daughter, father.

1566
01:24:28,676 --> 01:24:30,293
Have you forgotten your father, child?

1567
01:24:31,751 --> 01:24:33,212
I am not going to touch your feet.

1568
01:24:33,598 --> 01:24:37,082
You had promised me to call
everyday but didn't even call up once.

1569
01:24:37,162 --> 01:24:38,319
I am not going to talk to you.

1570
01:24:38,399 --> 01:24:39,876
You shouldn't say like this.
He is your father.

1571
01:24:39,956 --> 01:24:41,661
But he does not love
me a s a daughter.

1572
01:24:42,175 --> 01:24:44,978
What a stupid drama?
I hope the food is interesting.

1573
01:24:45,774 --> 01:24:46,498
Is he your son?

1574
01:24:46,578 --> 01:24:48,377
No, he is son of my MD

1575
01:24:49,007 --> 01:24:51,591
What is this? Why are you
calling him MD? Call him by his name.

1576
01:24:52,049 --> 01:24:54,188
- Actually, she lovingly calls me MD.
- Yes.

1577
01:24:55,326 --> 01:24:57,272
- What is your name son?
- Jawahar Karan.

1578
01:24:57,352 --> 01:24:59,564
- And your name?
- Akhtar Farhan.

1579
01:25:00,773 --> 01:25:03,604
Actually he was born while
watching Bhaag Milkha Bhaag.

1580
01:25:03,684 --> 01:25:05,035
That is 4 years old movie.

1581
01:25:05,115 --> 01:25:08,582
You seem to forget again.
She is fan of him since Rock On.

1582
01:25:08,953 --> 01:25:11,541
Actually I a diehard Farhan fan.

1583
01:25:12,594 --> 01:25:15,520
- Shall we talk about what
we came here for? - Yes. Yes.

1584
01:25:16,505 --> 01:25:16,603
I wanted to say something.

1585
01:25:17,565 --> 01:25:20,096
Your dear daughter is
in our house for last 1 week.

1586
01:25:20,176 --> 01:25:21,847
She has mixed up well with us.

1587
01:25:21,927 --> 01:25:23,912
In last so many days she has mixed up.

1588
01:25:24,065 --> 01:25:27,071
If I was there I would
have stuck to everyone.

1589
01:25:27,531 --> 01:25:29,447
She means to say that she would
have won everyone's heart in two days.

1590
01:25:29,527 --> 01:25:30,674
If you give permission..

1591
01:25:30,754 --> 01:25:33,728
..then I would like to get
my son married to your daughter.

1592
01:25:33,808 --> 01:25:35,272
Do you have any objection?

1593
01:25:35,971 --> 01:25:36,890
Shaelu..

1594
01:25:38,768 --> 01:25:41,389
..you love him. Did you
reward me like this for my love?

1595
01:25:41,544 --> 01:25:43,955
During childhood I had made
you drink polio drops with my hand.

1596
01:25:44,035 --> 01:25:46,996
And now because of you
I will have to drink poison.

1597
01:25:47,265 --> 01:25:48,497
Will you insult me?

1598
01:25:48,577 --> 01:25:49,835
If you want to wear
ring given by him..

1599
01:25:49,915 --> 01:25:51,542
..then remove my diamond
ring immediately.

1600
01:25:52,697 --> 01:25:53,959
No, I will not remove.

1601
01:25:54,039 --> 01:25:55,400
Remove it, remove it..

1602
01:25:55,596 --> 01:25:57,573
- Remove and give it to me.
- Now you wait, it is my turn.

1603
01:25:58,077 --> 01:26:01,199
You did not even think
once about your uncle.

1604
01:26:01,279 --> 01:26:05,117
Whenever you asked for
anything I gave it to you.

1605
01:26:05,027 --> 01:26:07,974
I always gave you
more than you demanded.

1606
01:26:08,297 --> 01:26:11,625
You ignored all of us and
fell in love with this fool.

1607
01:26:11,705 --> 01:26:14,618
If you have to wear the
real gold chain given by them..

1608
01:26:14,698 --> 01:26:18,213
..then you will have to
remove this artificial chain now.

1609
01:26:18,293 --> 01:26:20,312
- What are you doing?
- Remove it.

1610
01:26:20,576 --> 01:26:23,329
Listen completely. You misunderstood.

1611
01:26:23,409 --> 01:26:24,988
They do not love each other.

1612
01:26:25,068 --> 01:26:28,196
I wanted them to get married.

1613
01:26:28,276 --> 01:26:30,538
Even Shelja does not
know anything about it.

1614
01:26:30,618 --> 01:26:34,142
If you do not have any objection
then say yes for their marriage.

1615
01:26:34,332 --> 01:26:36,636
1Okay, let us first
talk about payment.

1616
01:26:37,005 --> 01:26:38,888
No problem. Siddharth..

1617
01:26:40,128 --> 01:26:42,416
What was the need to do
over acting in front of father?

1618
01:26:42,496 --> 01:26:45,269
It is not our fault. Your
father came directly to climax scene.

1619
01:26:45,349 --> 01:26:46,707
What is the use of us being actors?

1620
01:26:46,787 --> 01:26:47,700
Look Siddharth.

1621
01:26:47,078 --> 01:26:49,482
We have delivered the dialogues
according to the money you had given.

1622
01:26:50,264 --> 01:26:51,741
We need extra money
for extra dialogue.

1623
01:26:51,821 --> 01:26:52,827
Non actor, rascal..

1624
01:26:52,961 --> 01:26:56,214
Prasad, there is
no hurry from our side.

1625
01:26:56,294 --> 01:26:59,353
Discuss it among yourself.
And then give your answer.

1626
01:27:00,199 --> 01:27:01,943
We will wait.

1627
01:27:02,607 --> 01:27:04,818
Let's go Siddharth.

1628
01:27:05,056 --> 01:27:06,281
I will see you..

1629
01:27:07,433 --> 01:27:09,415
- I think we will have to change
the producer. - Yes, let's think.

1630
01:27:09,495 --> 01:27:11,506
Look, we will have to wait here today.
Understood.

1631
01:27:11,685 --> 01:27:12,326
- Come with me.
- What?

1632
01:27:12,406 --> 01:27:13,987
Wait. Today she is my wife.

1633
01:27:14,067 --> 01:27:16,306
- She is your false wife but
my time pass girlfriend. - Take her.

1634
01:27:16,081 --> 01:27:19,085
Brother, we have searched everywhere.

1635
01:27:19,894 --> 01:27:22,155
I don't think he stays in this city.

1636
01:27:22,492 --> 01:27:24,499
But his sister and
brother-in-law stay here.

1637
01:27:24,642 --> 01:27:26,623
- In Hyderabad.
- In Hyderabad?

1638
01:27:26,703 --> 01:27:28,855
If you give permission
then shall I kidnap them?

1639
01:27:35,044 --> 01:27:36,928
What happened, Siddhu?
What happened of that work?

1640
01:27:37,404 --> 01:27:38,707
The situation is
very tight here, Bauji.

1641
01:27:38,787 --> 01:27:39,790
You will have to wait a bit.

1642
01:27:39,087 --> 01:27:40,119
I cannot wait anymore..

1643
01:28:06,981 --> 01:28:10,310
Are you surprised to see
your enemy in front of you?

1644
01:28:11,548 --> 01:28:14,030
Someone has kidnapped my daughter.

1645
01:28:16,106 --> 01:28:17,182
- Who kidnapped her?
- He calls him her lover.

1646
01:28:17,946 --> 01:28:19,515
We have come to know
that he is from Hyderabad.

1647
01:28:19,595 --> 01:28:20,822
I have come for him.

1648
01:28:21,133 --> 01:28:21,905
Hey..

1649
01:28:23,006 --> 01:28:24,641
He is the one.

1650
01:28:30,081 --> 01:28:33,084
If I wish I can finish him with the
help of police and political power.

1651
01:28:33,092 --> 01:28:36,284
But it is matter of my daughter
so do not want any kind of insult.

1652
01:28:37,585 --> 01:28:40,300
I know that you rule Hyderabad.

1653
01:28:40,441 --> 01:28:43,642
Forget the past and
even I will do that.

1654
01:28:43,824 --> 01:28:44,885
I should get my daughter back.

1655
01:28:45,514 --> 01:28:47,327
Rest we will talk later.

1656
01:28:47,407 --> 01:28:49,480
He will be found wherever
he is in Hyderabad.

1657
01:28:50,468 --> 01:28:54,349
You will get your daughter back
and I will get my old friend back.

1658
01:28:54,429 --> 01:28:55,607
- PR.
- Good.

1659
01:28:56,183 --> 01:28:58,274
Till Shelja is not found
I will remain in this city.

1660
01:28:59,035 --> 01:29:00,471
I will do whatever I have to do.

1661
01:29:00,931 --> 01:29:02,517
You do your work. Take this.

1662
01:29:07,683 --> 01:29:11,468
Lollipop was enjoyable at
night and had a good sleep as well.

1663
01:29:11,548 --> 01:29:13,045
If you eat food by cheating others
then you will be able to sleep well.

1664
01:29:13,125 --> 01:29:14,907
The bodies of celebrities
get peace of mind at such places.

1665
01:29:14,987 --> 01:29:16,055
That is there.

1666
01:29:18,458 --> 01:29:20,836
- Hello! - Hello Rama Rao,
how are you by spraying perfume.

1667
01:29:20,916 --> 01:29:22,489
- Yes, I am fine.
- Where are you now?

1668
01:29:22,569 --> 01:29:24,500
At this moment I am
sitting in Sunside Resort.

1669
01:29:24,058 --> 01:29:25,147
Even I am staying in Sunside Resort.

1670
01:29:26,055 --> 01:29:27,946
It's been two day since I am here.

1671
01:29:28,521 --> 01:29:30,822
- Why didn't you come and meet me?
- Who is speaking?

1672
01:29:30,902 --> 01:29:33,296
I am Perfume Prasad speaking
by applying perfume.

1673
01:29:33,376 --> 01:29:35,342
- Perfume Prasad.
- Yes.

1674
01:29:35,422 --> 01:29:37,816
Perfume Prasad is sitting in
front of me. Are you duplicate one?

1675
01:29:37,896 --> 01:29:40,481
If I am here then how
did duplicate reach there?

1676
01:29:40,561 --> 01:29:41,576
Give the phone to me. I will talk.

1677
01:29:41,656 --> 01:29:42,938
Who is he?
He is calling himself Perfume Prasad.

1678
01:29:43,018 --> 01:29:44,960
Who are you?
By being real Perfume Prasad..

1679
01:29:45,004 --> 01:29:46,891
..you are sending
duplicate Perfume Prasad.

1680
01:29:47,007 --> 01:29:49,451
If you call up again
then I will not spare you.

1681
01:29:50,391 --> 01:29:51,702
Will you thrash me?

1682
01:29:52,143 --> 01:29:54,547
If I wouldn't have come then you
all duplicate would be behind bars.

1683
01:29:54,627 --> 01:29:56,932
Have you received the extra payment?
So deal with climax and seal it.

1684
01:29:57,012 --> 01:29:58,036
Where id climax com
from before interval?

1685
01:29:58,332 --> 01:29:59,605
Finish the movie.
Everything will be discussed later.

1686
01:29:59,685 --> 01:30:01,614
- Come on.
- Okay, come on.

1687
01:30:02,162 --> 01:30:05,346
I was sure that you would agree.

1688
01:30:05,426 --> 01:30:07,315
A movie is completed with 60 scenes..

1689
01:30:07,395 --> 01:30:09,194
..but for a marriage
two families are enough.

1690
01:30:09,274 --> 01:30:12,277
According to my study your
family will get two Filmfare awards..

1691
01:30:12,384 --> 01:30:14,235
..if you work in Hum
Aapke Hain Kaun part 2.

1692
01:30:14,837 --> 01:30:17,673
He means to say that everyone in
our family lives with love and unity.

1693
01:30:17,753 --> 01:30:20,250
We have brought up our
daughter with love and pampering.

1694
01:30:20,033 --> 01:30:22,274
Is your family together?

1695
01:30:22,651 --> 01:30:25,867
She means to say that we
have brought her up with love.

1696
01:30:25,947 --> 01:30:27,693
We will keep her as our daughter.

1697
01:30:27,773 --> 01:30:29,151
We had made a promise..

1698
01:30:29,231 --> 01:30:31,570
..that if the marriage is
fixed then we will go to Tirupati.

1699
01:30:31,065 --> 01:30:33,276
If you agree hen shall
we take Shelja with us.

1700
01:30:33,941 --> 01:30:35,497
She is your daughter
so you can take her.

1701
01:30:36,978 --> 01:30:38,676
- Listen, have you taken
all your things. - The train has come.

1702
01:30:38,756 --> 01:30:39,792
- Wait..
- Come on, give me the bag.

1703
01:30:39,872 --> 01:30:41,479
- You leave it. I will pick it up.
- Okay.

1704
01:30:42,648 --> 01:30:44,483
Brother, will you be
able to go through the door?

1705
01:30:44,563 --> 01:30:48,396
Listen, whenever I sat on horse and
went for marriage the bride ran away.

1706
01:30:48,476 --> 01:30:49,969
That is why this
time I will go by train.

1707
01:30:50,049 --> 01:30:51,302
Your thinking is great.

1708
01:30:51,684 --> 01:30:52,963
Where is my bride?

1709
01:30:53,149 --> 01:30:54,523
I hope she too has not escaped.

1710
01:30:54,603 --> 01:30:56,370
Brother, new bride.
Catch hold of her before she escapes.

1711
01:30:58,723 --> 01:30:59,924
Go and catch her.

1712
01:31:00,224 --> 01:31:01,411
How will I catch her? You catch her.

1713
01:31:01,491 --> 01:31:02,883
Get lost. You are good for nothing.

1714
01:31:02,963 --> 01:31:04,041
While catching her,
the train will depart. Come on now.

1715
01:31:04,823 --> 01:31:05,476
Hurry up.

1716
01:31:05,556 --> 01:31:06,698
- Come on. Hurry up.
- Come on. Come on.

1717
01:31:06,868 --> 01:31:09,949
Sujata, Siddharth fulfilled
my heart's desire.

1718
01:31:10,255 --> 01:31:15,074
Forgetting that love he is going
to marry the girl whom I have chosen.

1719
01:31:15,552 --> 01:31:17,076
I am very happy today.

1720
01:31:18,541 --> 01:31:19,602
Unknowingly we are making a mistake.

1721
01:31:20,905 --> 01:31:22,984
Just to convince father
we are cheating him.

1722
01:31:24,368 --> 01:31:26,364
Let's tell him that
you are the same girl.

1723
01:31:31,767 --> 01:31:32,801
Uncle, I was..

1724
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:34,494
I know everything Siddharth.

1725
01:31:35,067 --> 01:31:38,039
Because of your one lies
today brother is so happy.

1726
01:31:38,845 --> 01:31:40,211
Don't let his happiness fade away.

1727
01:31:40,291 --> 01:31:41,390
Let it go the way it is going on.

1728
01:31:41,597 --> 01:31:43,345
We will manage whatever happens later.
Don't speak anything.

1729
01:31:43,425 --> 01:31:44,368
- Rama Rao..
- Yes, brother.

1730
01:31:44,448 --> 01:31:45,634
- Hurry up, the train is about to leave.
- Yes, come on.

1731
01:31:45,714 --> 01:31:46,538
Come on. Let's go.

1732
01:31:47,019 --> 01:31:47,958
Bye.

1733
01:31:48,022 --> 01:31:49,334
Siddharth, take care of yourself.

1734
01:31:49,612 --> 01:31:51,271
Yes, once the work is over
I will come by the next train.

1735
01:31:51,351 --> 01:31:52,293
- Bye.
- Bye.

1736
01:31:54,612 --> 01:31:57,803
- Hello.. - Hey, you had promised
to kidnap PR's daughter..

1737
01:31:57,883 --> 01:31:59,642
..and get her married to my son.

1738
01:31:59,722 --> 01:32:01,560
And now you are dreaming
of getting married to her.

1739
01:32:01,068 --> 01:32:03,787
As a goon you are thinking so much..

1740
01:32:04,479 --> 01:32:06,347
..so just imagine how
much would I think as a lover.

1741
01:32:06,427 --> 01:32:09,900
I know. If you have courage
then I have brains with courage.

1742
01:32:09,098 --> 01:32:11,554
That is why you are
going to get a shock.

1743
01:32:12,516 --> 01:32:14,578
You didn't understand.
Turn back and look..

1744
01:32:31,339 --> 01:32:32,344
Shit..

1745
01:32:36,944 --> 01:32:39,746
Hey, listen to me carefully.

1746
01:32:39,913 --> 01:32:41,519
Between every two stations..

1747
01:32:41,066 --> 01:32:44,072
..at least two members
of his family should die.

1748
01:32:48,623 --> 01:32:50,648
If you wish to eat
something then I have.

1749
01:32:54,569 --> 01:32:55,751
This is the same family.

1750
01:32:55,831 --> 01:32:59,348
If that boy is with them then
again he will run away with the bride.

1751
01:33:00,043 --> 01:33:03,812
Let's do one thing. Let them first get
down and then I will meet my bride.

1752
01:33:03,892 --> 01:33:05,763
Till that time we
will sit in the bathroom.

1753
01:33:28,698 --> 01:33:29,901
Hey, wait rascal.

1754
01:33:32,076 --> 01:33:32,730
Hey..

1755
01:33:33,634 --> 01:33:34,690
Hey, what happened?
Why are you standing on the way?

1756
01:33:38,572 --> 01:33:40,000
I don't know when will
he stop following me?

1757
01:33:40,008 --> 01:33:42,077
Whenever I plan to get married
he runs away with the bride.

1758
01:33:50,085 --> 01:33:52,424
Hey, from the time
you have come here..

1759
01:33:53,269 --> 01:33:55,915
..you are giving lift
to girls on your BMW cycle.

1760
01:33:55,995 --> 01:33:59,981
How dare you ask for lift
from my ex and future wife?

1761
01:34:00,061 --> 01:34:02,396
Not a car but a crane
is required to lift them.

1762
01:34:02,682 --> 01:34:04,586
Do you think I am the
one who uses the crane?

1763
01:34:04,666 --> 01:34:09,245
Yes. That is why village
girls rejected a Dracula like you.

1764
01:34:09,423 --> 01:34:11,522
Look at them. They look like witches.

1765
01:34:11,738 --> 01:34:13,949
You three can make a secret movie.
Get a side.

1766
01:34:15,049 --> 01:34:17,847
Whatever you may say but
he is smart and intelligent.

1767
01:34:18,368 --> 01:34:19,449
- Wonderful.
- It was a great shot.

1768
01:34:20,753 --> 01:34:22,408
You really acted well. You are a star.

1769
01:34:22,488 --> 01:34:23,840
- Do you know me?
- Think it that way.

1770
01:34:23,092 --> 01:34:24,823
- We have come from Kolkatta.
- Kolkatta?

1771
01:34:25,731 --> 01:34:28,753
Yes sir. We have come
to find a man in Hyderabad.

1772
01:34:29,031 --> 01:34:31,670
Just to find him we came
to the studio and met you.

1773
01:34:31,075 --> 01:34:32,126
- Do you have his photo?
- Yes.

1774
01:34:32,881 --> 01:34:35,576
Give the photo and I will put
it on what's app. I have any fans.

1775
01:34:35,656 --> 01:34:36,703
- Show me the photo.
- Of course sir.

1776
01:34:36,783 --> 01:34:37,986
Here it is. He is the one.

1777
01:34:39,045 --> 01:34:40,499
- He is Siddharth.
- Yes, you are right.

1778
01:34:40,579 --> 01:34:41,346
He is Siddhu.

1779
01:34:41,426 --> 01:34:42,931
- Do you know him?
- Yes I know him.

1780
01:34:43,011 --> 01:34:44,085
- Nicely.
- Absolutely nicely.

1781
01:34:45,369 --> 01:34:48,537
Immediately I want
the address of Siddharth..

1782
01:34:48,617 --> 01:34:50,622
..otherwise you all will be killed.

1783
01:34:51,197 --> 01:34:52,850
Believe us sir we are innocent.

1784
01:34:52,093 --> 01:34:55,420
The one who gave us the
contract must know about him.

1785
01:34:57,715 --> 01:34:59,756
Sir, he is thick skinned.
Ask him to thrash harder.

1786
01:35:00,205 --> 01:35:01,629
- Keep quiet.
- Tell me his address..

1787
01:35:01,839 --> 01:35:03,095
..otherwise you will be killed.

1788
01:35:03,175 --> 01:35:05,071
I cannot tolerate the thrashing more.

1789
01:35:05,151 --> 01:35:06,885
I will tell the address
as well phone number.

1790
01:35:08,903 --> 01:35:10,421
Everything will go on fine.

1791
01:35:10,501 --> 01:35:11,424
Hey,,

1792
01:35:12,411 --> 01:35:14,344
- Search the entire house.
- Who are you all?

1793
01:35:15,627 --> 01:35:16,836
Hey, who are you?

1794
01:35:17,468 --> 01:35:18,473
Hey..

1795
01:35:19,536 --> 01:35:21,061
Hey, hey..

1796
01:35:24,311 --> 01:35:25,040
Father..

1797
01:35:29,867 --> 01:35:30,494
Father..

1798
01:35:30,574 --> 01:35:31,775
Where is your son?

1799
01:35:31,934 --> 01:35:34,847
He kidnapped my daughter
and is dreaming of marrying her.

1800
01:35:34,927 --> 01:35:36,125
Am I a fool?

1801
01:35:36,479 --> 01:35:38,242
If I wish I can kill all of you..

1802
01:35:38,322 --> 01:35:39,329
..and get your daughter
married somewhere else.

1803
01:35:40,102 --> 01:35:41,991
Your son cannot do anything to me.

1804
01:35:42,071 --> 01:35:43,037
Father..

1805
01:35:44,239 --> 01:35:47,872
if anything happened to uncle then
at this moment I will cut my nerve.

1806
01:35:49,513 --> 01:35:52,561
They are not in fault.
I loved Siddharth.

1807
01:35:53,073 --> 01:35:54,129
I came in this house willingly.

1808
01:35:54,713 --> 01:35:56,699
Till now I have said all lies.

1809
01:36:02,237 --> 01:36:05,280
I will forget Siddharth
and his love as well.

1810
01:36:06,441 --> 01:36:09,789
I do not want anything
but you leave them.

1811
01:36:11,001 --> 01:36:12,429
I will come with you.

1812
01:36:53,286 --> 01:36:54,000
Father..

1813
01:36:57,007 --> 01:37:01,015
We all knew about
Siddharth and Shelja.

1814
01:37:02,097 --> 01:37:04,206
Shelja is not at fault in this.

1815
01:37:04,929 --> 01:37:06,972
We asked her to hide the truth..

1816
01:37:07,572 --> 01:37:09,664
..till you do not
say yes for the marriage.

1817
01:37:11,036 --> 01:37:13,799
I also purposely
acted to be forgetful.

1818
01:37:14,871 --> 01:37:16,857
I saw their love brother..

1819
01:37:17,557 --> 01:37:20,483
..and realized that Shelja
is perfect for our Siddharth.

1820
01:37:20,973 --> 01:37:21,984
Forgive me.

1821
01:37:22,767 --> 01:37:24,553
I did this for the
happiness of this house.

1822
01:37:26,197 --> 01:37:28,633
Father-in-law,
if they wanted to marry..

1823
01:37:28,713 --> 01:37:30,032
..then they would
have done this long back.

1824
01:37:30,112 --> 01:37:32,354
They love you so that
is why they did not do.

1825
01:37:49,789 --> 01:37:51,792
Brother..

1826
01:37:52,675 --> 01:37:58,391
-What happened? - Sister's father
came and took her with him, brother.

1827
01:37:59,055 --> 01:37:59,947
This is true..

1828
01:38:02,053 --> 01:38:04,075
..and father has come
to know about everything.

1829
01:38:08,206 --> 01:38:09,495
Forgive me father.

1830
01:38:11,049 --> 01:38:12,836
I did not want to cheat you.

1831
01:38:14,861 --> 01:38:16,837
Shelja wanted to win
your heart and faith.

1832
01:38:17,138 --> 01:38:18,623
I love her a lot.

1833
01:38:24,386 --> 01:38:25,479
But my love is nothing..

1834
01:38:28,447 --> 01:38:30,270
..in front of your love, father.

1835
01:38:30,676 --> 01:38:31,913
I will forget her.

1836
01:38:34,577 --> 01:38:36,889
You respected me as a father.

1837
01:38:37,446 --> 01:38:40,904
You fulfilled the duties of a son.

1838
01:38:41,365 --> 01:38:43,491
But I could not understand
and recognize your love.

1839
01:38:43,964 --> 01:38:47,488
Today I have realized that
you all are so close to my heart.

1840
01:38:48,057 --> 01:38:51,554
I am so selfish.
I could not understand..

1841
01:38:53,008 --> 01:38:54,404
..the love of you both.

1842
01:38:56,099 --> 01:38:57,910
I could not understand, son.

1843
01:39:02,832 --> 01:39:05,987
This marriage will take place
on the day it has been finalized.

1844
01:39:06,067 --> 01:39:07,460
Whatever may happen?

1845
01:39:08,448 --> 01:39:10,399
Thank you, father. Thank you.

1846
01:39:23,211 --> 01:39:24,294
Hey..

1847
01:39:29,001 --> 01:39:30,146
Hey, come out.

1848
01:39:30,787 --> 01:39:32,252
- Come with me.
- Leave me.

1849
01:39:32,717 --> 01:39:34,232
What is all this?

1850
01:39:34,312 --> 01:39:36,614
You have got trapped in my plan PR.

1851
01:39:36,694 --> 01:39:38,582
I had sent Siddhu..

1852
01:39:38,662 --> 01:39:41,110
..so that I could get my
son married to your daughter.

1853
01:39:41,019 --> 01:39:42,363
If you do not believe then look there.

1854
01:39:42,614 --> 01:39:43,866
They both are looking
so good together.

1855
01:39:43,946 --> 01:39:47,287
My son had become very sad
after separating from your daughter.

1856
01:39:47,367 --> 01:39:50,369
Hey stupid,
you are making a very big mistake.

1857
01:39:51,396 --> 01:39:55,293
PR, you are forgetting that
this is not your Bengal but Hyderabad.

1858
01:39:55,373 --> 01:39:57,517
This is my area.
Come on let's go. Come on.

1859
01:39:58,161 --> 01:39:59,350
Hey, come on..

1860
01:39:59,879 --> 01:40:01,444
- Father..
- Come on sit in the car.

1861
01:40:05,904 --> 01:40:07,165
- Listen to me carefully, Abhay.
- Tell me.

1862
01:40:07,245 --> 01:40:10,296
PR has taken Shelja and has gone
on the highway with three four cars.

1863
01:40:10,376 --> 01:40:11,588
- We will have to stop him at any cost.
- Siddharth..

1864
01:40:11,668 --> 01:40:12,791
- You move ahead and I will follow you.
- Listen..

1865
01:40:12,871 --> 01:40:14,579
They are taking Shelja away
so we will have to stop them.

1866
01:40:14,659 --> 01:40:16,053
Yes uncle,
I am also planning about that.

1867
01:40:16,133 --> 01:40:17,478
You are here then who will top them.

1868
01:40:18,388 --> 01:40:19,486
There is a storm..

1869
01:40:19,566 --> 01:40:21,444
"Savior.."

1870
01:40:35,751 --> 01:40:38,166
"Savior.."

1871
01:40:43,028 --> 01:40:45,947
"Run away my saviour has arrived"

1872
01:40:47,529 --> 01:40:48,608
Who are you?

1873
01:40:50,966 --> 01:40:53,854
His name is Daya and
he is not at all kind.

1874
01:40:54,638 --> 01:40:58,186
So rascal,
what are you smuggling in the car?

1875
01:40:58,071 --> 01:41:01,582
You do not know me and I
am not interested in knowing you.

1876
01:41:02,601 --> 01:41:05,050
One step by me and the
geography gets shaken up.

1877
01:41:07,642 --> 01:41:08,209
Earthquake..

1878
01:41:08,289 --> 01:41:09,505
What nonsense are you talking?

1879
01:41:09,585 --> 01:41:11,253
Do you know the meaning
of stopping me in between?

1880
01:41:13,807 --> 01:41:15,608
Why are you firing?

1881
01:41:16,171 --> 01:41:17,706
Because not he but his gun speaks.

1882
01:41:17,786 --> 01:41:19,542
You will take time
to understand his language.

1883
01:41:19,622 --> 01:41:21,314
- What?
- Because he is deaf.

1884
01:41:21,442 --> 01:41:22,513
- Deaf..
- Deaf..

1885
01:41:22,906 --> 01:41:24,994
Hey, brother is the lion of this city.

1886
01:41:32,299 --> 01:41:34,463
Absolutely right. I am the lion.

1887
01:41:34,543 --> 01:41:37,782
Cowards like you
get scared on seeing me.

1888
01:41:37,862 --> 01:41:39,760
I will not spare you.

1889
01:41:40,915 --> 01:41:42,177
Are you a mimicry artist?

1890
01:41:44,043 --> 01:41:44,591
What are you doing?

1891
01:41:45,058 --> 01:41:46,636
Sir is frustrated as of now.

1892
01:41:46,771 --> 01:41:48,540
If you convince him only
then he will allow you to ahead.

1893
01:41:48,062 --> 01:41:50,273
But how will we pacify him.
He is deaf.

1894
01:41:50,911 --> 01:41:54,116
He likes movie songs. Every
day he watches movies for 6 hours.

1895
01:41:54,196 --> 01:41:57,471
Dance and sing. If sir
likes it then he will let you go.

1896
01:41:59,503 --> 01:42:00,158
Hello..

1897
01:42:03,425 --> 01:42:05,168
Home minister. My wife is calling.

1898
01:42:05,248 --> 01:42:06,856
Understand the matter
and explain it to me.

1899
01:42:08,114 --> 01:42:10,473
- Hello.
- I am Mrs. Daya speaking.

1900
01:42:10,815 --> 01:42:12,988
Tomorrow is our marriage anniversary.

1901
01:42:13,183 --> 01:42:17,872
Ask my husband to take me to
the honeymoon picnic spot once again.

1902
01:42:19,406 --> 01:42:21,408
Why are you feeling shy?
Tell me what she is saying.

1903
01:42:21,488 --> 01:42:22,742
How will I explain this deaf?

1904
01:42:22,822 --> 01:42:24,224
Brother, I will try..

1905
01:42:24,391 --> 01:42:25,363
Okay, do..

1906
01:42:32,151 --> 01:42:32,757
Stop it.

1907
01:42:32,837 --> 01:42:34,301
Why are you dancing like a prostitute?

1908
01:42:34,381 --> 01:42:36,323
You will have to dance
like in black and white movies.

1909
01:42:36,403 --> 01:42:37,741
Go and dance like that.

1910
01:42:38,023 --> 01:42:42,829
"People say that this
world is like a fair."

1911
01:42:42,909 --> 01:42:52,053
"Then what is meeting
and what is being alone."

1912
01:42:52,133 --> 01:42:53,357
"Alone.."

1913
01:42:53,437 --> 01:42:53,982
What did you say?

1914
01:42:54,062 --> 01:42:57,019
"Alone."

1915
01:42:57,788 --> 01:42:59,840
"People say that.."

1916
01:42:59,092 --> 01:43:00,408
Stop this drama.

1917
01:43:01,768 --> 01:43:03,139
Has the cockroach entered your pant?

1918
01:43:03,586 --> 01:43:05,004
Tomorrow is our marriage anniversary.

1919
01:43:05,084 --> 01:43:08,153
She must have said to take
me to that honeymoon spot again.

1920
01:43:08,854 --> 01:43:09,417
Isn't it?

1921
01:43:11,543 --> 01:43:15,175
Sir, as you had sad I
have stopped everyone here.

1922
01:43:15,255 --> 01:43:18,272
Sir, do not delay.
You know that I can lose my job.

1923
01:43:18,352 --> 01:43:20,320
- I have small children..
- Manage for some more time.

1924
01:43:20,992 --> 01:43:24,487
Sir I have no other topic
which can stop them here.

1925
01:43:24,567 --> 01:43:27,143
- I will send you a new topic.
- Superb sir.

1926
01:43:30,495 --> 01:43:31,501
Whose call it is?

1927
01:43:31,635 --> 01:43:34,438
Explain me the content.

1928
01:43:35,033 --> 01:43:35,111
- Hello..
- Hello.

1929
01:43:35,893 --> 01:43:37,124
I am commissioner of police speaking.

1930
01:43:37,029 --> 01:43:38,091
15 Naxalites have entered the city.

1931
01:43:39,047 --> 01:43:41,745
Ask Daya to do encounter
as soon as he sees them.

1932
01:43:41,917 --> 01:43:44,436
This is important message.
How should I explain this?

1933
01:43:44,516 --> 01:43:46,105
You just have to give me
message and not throw a bomb.

1934
01:43:46,185 --> 01:43:47,671
- Why are you soscared?
- Who do you think we are?

1935
01:43:47,751 --> 01:43:48,505
Are we servant of your father?

1936
01:43:50,196 --> 01:43:52,084
Content. Explain me the content.

1937
01:43:52,763 --> 01:43:53,674
I will explain sir.

1938
01:43:58,051 --> 01:44:02,827
"How many arms, how many heads.
Count the enemies properly."

1939
01:44:02,907 --> 01:44:07,644
"How many arms, how many heads.
Count the enemies properly."

1940
01:44:07,799 --> 01:44:12,551
"They will lose every
game if we are careful."

1941
01:44:12,748 --> 01:44:17,500
"They will lose every
game if we are careful."

1942
01:44:37,315 --> 01:44:38,359
Stop, stop..

1943
01:44:38,935 --> 01:44:40,698
I understood. Naxalites have entered.

1944
01:44:40,778 --> 01:44:42,161
That means you have understood.
Now let us go.

1945
01:44:42,241 --> 01:44:42,817
Get aside.

1946
01:44:42,096 --> 01:44:43,449
Why are you begging from him?

1947
01:44:44,393 --> 01:44:45,799
The girl is with us, father.

1948
01:44:46,242 --> 01:44:50,096
Let us go otherwise your
dead body will pass from this way.

1949
01:44:50,996 --> 01:44:52,687
What drama is going on?

1950
01:44:52,767 --> 01:44:53,821
Hey, make this deaf understand.

1951
01:44:54,712 --> 01:44:59,934
"I stay in Rampur and
my name is Lakshmana."

1952
01:45:00,014 --> 01:45:04,857
"I speak straight
and do my work properly."

1953
01:45:05,584 --> 01:45:10,366
"But I am very moody."

1954
01:45:10,552 --> 01:45:14,327
"I am equivalent to 100."

1955
01:45:15,188 --> 01:45:20,196
"I stay in Rampur and
my name is Lakshmana."

1956
01:45:20,348 --> 01:45:25,444
"I speak straight
and do my work properly."

1957
01:45:37,717 --> 01:45:38,754
I understood.

1958
01:45:39,349 --> 01:45:43,130
Do you have the daring
to do encounter of a policeman?

1959
01:45:47,651 --> 01:45:48,888
Are you gone mad?

1960
01:45:49,419 --> 01:45:50,237
Enough.

1961
01:45:53,051 --> 01:45:53,694
Sir..

1962
01:45:55,014 --> 01:45:56,059
A new problem again.

1963
01:45:56,265 --> 01:45:59,564
We got information that
you are smuggling red sandalwood.

1964
01:45:59,838 --> 01:46:01,711
But here is the case
of kidnapping a girl.

1965
01:46:01,791 --> 01:46:02,623
We will not be spared now.

1966
01:46:02,703 --> 01:46:03,752
Who are you, dear?

1967
01:46:03,832 --> 01:46:06,227
- Sir I..
- I will explain, I will explain.

1968
01:46:07,183 --> 01:46:15,077
"his is the condition
of one who is in love."

1969
01:46:15,436 --> 01:46:21,844
"Just see what all things
will fall in love show."

1970
01:46:21,924 --> 01:46:22,597
Stay away.

1971
01:46:22,924 --> 01:46:24,665
Sir, they have kidnapped me.

1972
01:46:26,236 --> 01:46:26,661
Sir..

1973
01:46:29,533 --> 01:46:34,972
"Ask from floating
clouds and flowing river.."

1974
01:46:35,052 --> 01:46:40,560
"Ask from the scenes and weather.."

1975
01:46:40,064 --> 01:46:45,430
"They know my name."

1976
01:46:46,086 --> 01:46:50,020
"I am with them morning and evening."

1977
01:46:50,331 --> 01:46:55,676
"Ask from floating
clouds and flowing river.."

1978
01:46:55,756 --> 01:46:58,047
"Ask from the scenes.."

1979
01:46:58,127 --> 01:46:59,924
Enough, child. Enough..

1980
01:47:00,941 --> 01:47:03,304
Now I have understood everything.

1981
01:47:03,087 --> 01:47:07,498
By kidnapping this girl you
want to get your son married to her.

1982
01:47:10,778 --> 01:47:13,573
Don't worry child.
You are the heroine of this movie.

1983
01:47:13,812 --> 01:47:16,198
Tell me the name of your hero.
I will help you to meet him.

1984
01:47:24,709 --> 01:47:25,615
Siddhu..

1985
01:47:32,371 --> 01:47:33,838
Why are you giving that dirty smile?

1986
01:47:34,032 --> 01:47:36,065
It is duty of policemen
to save public.

1987
01:47:36,442 --> 01:47:39,361
But it is the duty
of hero to save his love.

1988
01:47:40,501 --> 01:47:41,619
Kill that rascal.

1989
01:48:12,344 --> 01:48:14,929
Shinde, stop the car.

1990
01:48:17,498 --> 01:48:19,187
Bride number 2. Let her go.

1991
01:48:19,267 --> 01:48:20,360
Continue the fight.

1992
01:48:42,479 --> 01:48:44,532
Shinde, stop and check.

1993
01:48:52,032 --> 01:48:53,139
Hey bull, come here.

1994
01:48:54,029 --> 01:48:56,631
From who are you running
and where are you going?

1995
01:48:56,972 --> 01:48:59,758
I am going to get married
in the temple ahead.

1996
01:48:59,838 --> 01:49:01,560
After so long I am getting married..

1997
01:49:01,064 --> 01:49:02,520
..and the auspicious
time is also passing by.

1998
01:49:03,176 --> 01:49:04,574
Let us go. Say something, buddy.

1999
01:49:05,182 --> 01:49:08,273
Sir, our sir is deaf. Explain
whatever you want to say by dancing.

2000
01:49:09,422 --> 01:49:12,367
If this bride runs away
then my century will be completed.

2001
01:49:12,447 --> 01:49:14,615
Don't waste time. Sing something.

2002
01:49:19,136 --> 01:49:22,917
"There is flower shop below
and above is the house of my beloved."

2003
01:49:29,048 --> 01:49:32,466
"There is flower shop below
and above is the house of my beloved."

2004
01:49:32,546 --> 01:49:33,665
"When she peeps from.."

2005
01:49:33,745 --> 01:49:35,733
I shall not spare you, rascal.

2006
01:49:36,122 --> 01:49:37,727
Being so old you are
going to marry a young girl.

2007
01:49:37,807 --> 01:49:39,886
Go away otherwise
I will not spare you.

2008
01:49:39,966 --> 01:49:41,803
What are you looking at?
Take away this bulldozer.

2009
01:49:44,107 --> 01:49:47,110
Oh God, he is the marriage breaker.

2010
01:49:47,217 --> 01:49:49,449
Along with marriages he
even breaks bones. Run away.

2011
01:49:50,092 --> 01:49:51,116
- Shinde..
- Sir..

2012
01:49:52,024 --> 01:49:54,423
I have grabbed a lot of attention.
Now let the hero get the remaining.

2013
01:50:02,444 --> 01:50:04,669
Sir, can I talk with
you for two minutes?

2014
01:50:04,749 --> 01:50:07,066
- I don't want to talk.
- Sir, it will just take two minutes.

2015
01:50:07,146 --> 01:50:07,653
Tell me.

2016
01:50:07,733 --> 01:50:09,939
Not here but I want to talk
to you in private. Please, sir.

2017
01:50:12,893 --> 01:50:14,006
Scene change..

2018
01:50:16,734 --> 01:50:19,009
Why so much of formality?
You are not different from us.

2019
01:50:19,501 --> 01:50:20,527
What is this child?

2020
01:50:20,607 --> 01:50:23,171
You never told me that you
have found such a nice son-in-law.

2021
01:50:26,392 --> 01:50:29,615
He went there angrily
and came back smiling.

2022
01:50:29,695 --> 01:50:31,002
What brand did you make him drink?

2023
01:50:31,082 --> 01:50:32,758
It is not necessary to tell you.

2024
01:50:32,906 --> 01:50:38,602
I was not troubled so much
as I am now seeing you both together.

2025
01:50:38,682 --> 01:50:40,185
I am not able to understand anything.

2026
01:50:40,265 --> 01:50:41,829
How did you do this, son?

2027
01:50:42,908 --> 01:50:44,724
I showed him a short cut
of becoming a good father-in-law.

2028
01:50:46,644 --> 01:50:47,579
What is your problem?

2029
01:50:47,659 --> 01:50:49,732
I will not get my daughter
married to any common man.

2030
01:50:50,473 --> 01:50:51,807
He will not agree like this.

2031
01:50:57,762 --> 01:51:00,851
Brother, from today
my daughter Shelja is yours.

You had an angry nature
so how did you become so peaceful?

2033
01:51:03,798 --> 01:51:04,931
That is what?

01:51:05,528 --> 01:51:09,951
Brother, the thing is that when
I am angry then no one listens to me.
