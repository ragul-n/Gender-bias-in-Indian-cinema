7
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,300
First I want to see my grandson.

00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,900

- Take the luggage inside.

14
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,200
I am seeing him now,
after 3 years of his birth.

15
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,000
Here on, he'll stay here Dad.
Kiss grandfather!

16
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,700
Come fast.
Give him to me.

17
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,500
Hadn't you ask me what I've achieved?

18
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,100
She is my wife Bharathi,
and he is my son.

19
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,100
Pothuraju is my best friend.

20
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:45,500
Yes dear! He is Krishna
and he is Kucheludu.

21
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,400
What about me?
- You are our driver.

22
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:50,700
Our Krishna has earned
a lot of money abroad

23
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,400
...and has come here for us.

24
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,800
He is going to build
a sugar factory over here.

25
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,600
Not only that, a job to every home...

26
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,500
and as father wished,
500/0 share in profit is yours.

27
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,200
Andhra Bank.

28
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,900
1 crore rupees.

29
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I couldn't have done all the formalities
for the factory without Pothuraju.

30
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,000
What happened?

31
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,300
- Seems he is our Siva.
- Yes sir.

32
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,500
Hey Siva! What is this?

33
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,100
Give me the money.

34
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,000
You unfaithful dogs.

35
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,500
Why should I give you the money?

36
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,300
You wait Krishna.
I'll take care of this.

37
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,500
- Do you want money?
- Shoot him.

38
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:06,100
Do you want money?

39
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,300
Dear!

40
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:28,200
Pothraju, what is this?

41
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:30,200
I'm your best friend?

42
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,500
Why have you shot me?

43
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,000
I too want money.

44
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,700
I too want to go abroad.

45
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,200
I'm not your secretary.

46
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,900
I thought, he would have brought
money from abroad, not a gun!

47
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
It's heavy weight.

48
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:54,700
You fools! If anything happens wrongly,
we all will be finished.

49
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,300
Pothuraju! Tell our shares.

50
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,500
Take my shots but not your shares.

51
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,200
No, No Pothuraju.

52
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,500
As long as I live,
I'll be at your service.

53
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,500
You are my partner.

54
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:19,700
To do good for the village
but thieves robbed the money...

55
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:25,900
...and killed Pothuraju, Seshu,
Raghavaiah family and burned the car.

56
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,600
Seshu, bring my wife and
son to railway station.

57
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,300
Come.

58
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,600
- Seshu brother!
- Come, I'll tell you.

59
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,500
Come fast.

60
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,800
Put it inside.
Come dear.

61
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:40,600
Why had you called me?
What are in the bags?

62
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,900
Thieves killed the old man and
gave us the money. You come.

63
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,600
- You would have done something.
- You have got it, haven't you?

64
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,100
Stop your nusense.
Come.

65
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,700
- Give me the child.
- Leave him.

66
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,600
Wait, I'll see you.

67
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:59,400
Get in Pothuraju.

68
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,900
Get in fast.

69
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,600
She is only my relation so far.

70
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,500
Hence money only.

71
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,500
Music
Manisharma.

72
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:55,600
Come money god.
Come

73
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:58,600
It's very hot.
Sir! Money is very hot.

74
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,300
Come, if you want,
else leave it.

75
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:04,000
Fake currency have increased
than original currency in the city.

76
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:05,900
Greetings brother!

77
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,500
Acid! There is a delivery
day after tomorrow.

78
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:09,900
- Have you finished the printing?
- We'll get completed.

79
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,500
But only packing is taking a long time.

80
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,300
10 of our people died
in confront last month.

81
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,000
We need new people to deliver.
- Yes brother.

82
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,300
Police searching has also increased.
They will fear of them.

83
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,800
100 crore population are in India.
Won't we get the people?

84
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,200
Select 10 people.

85
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:37,200
- Brother! These are the people.
- Greetings sir.

86
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,300
Seeing the set up,
they are going to give us labour work.

87
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,200
- What are you?
- I sell black tickets.

88
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,400
- What about you?
- He sells drugs.

89
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,200
I pick pockets.

90
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,200
I do rowdiesm and goondaism.

91
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,500
I make enemies sleep restless.

92
00:06:56,700 --> 00:07:00,500
- You fatty!
- Seems he eats more food and sleeps well.

93
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,800
Appoint him as office boy.

94
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:06,000
I'll give you salary
what a software engineer gets.

95
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,800
Do your work calmly.
- Ok. - Go.

96
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,100
Hey, do it fast.

97
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,800
Brother! If we take much money,
won't there be any risk?

98
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,100
Why not?

99
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,900
Police on one side police and
Dass gang on the other side.

100
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,900
Our people died in last confrontation.

101
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,100
Now you are appointed fresh.
- Oh God!

102
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,200
Why does the confrontation happen?

103
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,400
Generally there have not been
confronts in 3 or 4 months.

104
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:45,400
Sometimes if our time is bad...

105
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,300
God! I've died.

106
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:01,500
I heard your printing is superb...

107
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:04,100
and Gandhi looks clear over the currency.

108
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,500
What is this twist,
when we join in the duty?

109
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,900
Who are these boys?
Are they new batch?

110
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:12,100
Already we are late,
we have to deliver it.

111
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,600
Yes, your time is over.

112
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:17,100
Printing is yours,
but delivery is ours.

113
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:24,300
Oh god!

114
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,600
Gosh!

115
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,500
Oh God!

116
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,400
I've hid here
without anyone's knowledge.

117
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,100
Acid brother!

118
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,200
Is it you?

119
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,000
Who is he?

120
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,800
Our leader.

121
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,900
What? Will you hit us coming by cycle?

122
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:39,700
Have you forgotten the history
who created sensations coming by cycle?

123
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:44,200
Or have you thought
none will come by cycle?

124
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:47,600
- Who are you?
- Kranthi. - Kanthri?

125
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,500
I am Kranthi to good people.

126
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,500
But I am Kanthri to bad people like you.

127
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,900
Do you know who I am?
I am Dass's man.

128
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,200
You tell me.

129
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,800
Should I fear you or Dass?

130
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,400
Total city people fear him,
hence you should too fear him.

131
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,200
Then, he is just equal to my hair.

132
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:08,200
I am his right hand.
So you should fear me.

133
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,600
Then, you are just my hair.

134
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,700
We've seen 1000 people's like you.

135
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:15,500
Is it?
I am 1001th type in that.

136
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,700
You couldn't see a movie like this.

137
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,600
All scenes will be new in style.

138
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,300
And it will have violence.

139
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,600
Dass right hand has broken...
Is there anybody his left hand here?

140
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,300
- It has broken.
- Hit them.

141
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,500
Why do they escape?

142
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,800
- What about the lorry?
- Get in, let's go.

143
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,200
- Escape from here.
- Get in.

144
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,900
- Do you have match box?
- Yes, I've.

145
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,100
Do you want cigarette?

146
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,400
He is going to burn the jeep.
Run away.

147
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,600
Many people have said that our house
tutelary norms is not good.

148
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,400
Weight shouldn't be there
in northeast corner.

149
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:48,800
You come here.

150
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,300
It is northeast where you stood.

151
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,900
Are you my weight or else anyone.

152
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,600
Where is Paidithalli?

153
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:58,600
Greetings sir!

154
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,600
Where is the money?

155
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:08,100
Even PR is in Hongkong,
Seshu maintains quality well.

156
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:11,000
Sample is fine but
where is the total goods?

157
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,300
It's the one that I have now.

158
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,200
- Are you kidding?
- No sir, it's true.

159
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,600
I'll burn you.

160
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,700
You went along with a gang but returned
with empty hand. What happened?

161
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,300
Goods were with me only.

162
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:29,800
But some new guy came and
attacked us suddenly.

163
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,400
He hit us violently.

164
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,800
PR maintains quality goods
and good people.

165
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,100
But I have these waste guys.

166
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,100
What Narsingh?
What happened?

167
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,600
I told him that I am your right hand.
That's why he broke my right hand.

168
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:44,200
Gosh!

169
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,700
It's ok, you brought Rs.50,000,
It'll serve the petrol expenses.

170
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:51,200
Are you worried?
Why are you giving me jeep keys?

171
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,000
He burned ourjeep.

172
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,600
- Who is that new guy?
- His name is Kanthri.

173
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,100
No, He is Kranthi sir.

174
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:11,400
If Kranthi had not come,
we would have lost all the goods.

175
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,200
We want him to do this kind of works.

176
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,000
Where does he stay?

177
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,500
'Premalayam'

178
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,100
It seems like an orphanage.

179
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,200
Don't pluck flowers.

180
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,800
If ladies pluck flowers,
they place it in their plaits.

181
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,300
But, where do you place it?

182
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,700
Who are you?
- I am an orphan.

183
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
- Who are they?
- We are also orphans. - Oh God!

184
00:14:55,700 --> 00:15:00,100
Oh Lord in Heaven!
Another sinner has come.

185
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:05,000
There is no place here
for a person like you.

186
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:10,500
If you have any wound,
I'll see and allow you.

187
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,500
I am not an orphan.

188
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,900
He has come for our Kranthi.

189
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:19,900
Dear Kranthi! An aged person
has come for you.

190
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,500
- Move aside.
- Be calm.

191
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,800
- Aged person?
- No.

192
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,700
Are you the acid used
for cleaning bathroom?

193
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,900
Entire city shakes for this acid.

194
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,600
Will you clean all bathrooms in the city?

195
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:35,600
- Yesterday I was not well...
- Stop blabbering and come to the point.

196
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:36,900
Won't you let me tell about myself?

197
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,800
Ok, come sir is calling you.

198
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,600
Brother?
Who is he?

199
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,300
Don't you know about brother.

200
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,900
As far as I know,
there was only one person called...

201
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,900
...as 'Brother' without
any blood relation in AP.

202
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,400
Now he is in heaven

203
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:52,900
No one has born to be called after him.
Tell me about the matter.

204
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,700
Our Seshu brother is
calling you, Come.

205
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,700
I won't come just by calling...
I want advance.

206
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,200
Advance? We don't get
our wages properly there.

207
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,900
Worker gets wages...

208
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,900
Useful person gets advance...

209
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,600
You won't understand.
Call him.

210
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,600
Brother! He wants an advance.

211
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:08,900
Give phone to him.

212
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,600
Had you asked advance?

213
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,200
Have you become hero by one fight?

214
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:17,000
One fight? I am famous for fights.

215
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,600
You must give me an advance.

216
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,300
Yesterday I didn't give you advance,
then why did you do it?

217
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,000
Yesterday your boys
had just seen a trailer.

218
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,100
Trailer is free.

219
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:27,400
If you want to see my movie,
advance booking is a must.

220
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:30,100
If you buy the ticket and enter inside, .

221
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,500
...there'll be so much entertainment
which you expect.

222
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,600
He would be useful to us.

223
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,900
- Give him 1 lakh rupees.
- Ok.

224
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:44,200
He won't give our wages properly.
But he'll give him advance...

225
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,900
Father uses it for a month's expenses.

226
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,800
Can't you say thanks to me?
You are arrogant.

227
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,300
Only my body weight has decreased
but not my head weight.

228
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:57,000
It comes by birth.
Go.

229
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:57,900
It means to get out.
Come.

230
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:32,500
<i>No one is as mass as him.</i>

231
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:35,100
<i>None is as class as him.</i>

232
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,700
<i>Don't quarrel,</i>
<i>He is dangerous</i>

233
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:48,200
<i>He is a tiger in doing work.</i>

234
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,900
<i>He is a hunter to enemies.</i>

235
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,200
<i>He is a big fighter in betting.</i>

236
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,800
<i>I am a dangerous one.</i>

237
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:01,500
<i>I am all in all to myself.</i>

238
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,100
<i>I fight day and night.</i>

239
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:07,400
<i>I am arrogant by birth.</i>

240
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:15,700
<i>If anyone challenges me,</i>
<i>Violence is the end.</i>

241
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:18,100
<i>Bullets will be silent in front of me.</i>

242
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:23,500
<i>I've license to fight,</i>
<i>go forward.</i>

243
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:16,200
<i>He is a dangerous one</i>

244
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:41,400
<i>If fight starts,</i>
<i>he'll be in front.</i>

245
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:44,200
<i>He equals to 10 thousand horse power...</i>

246
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:49,700
<i>He is an explode fire and cracker.</i>

247
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,200
Today's weather forecast report.

248
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:24,200
The sky is cloudy,
but won't be rain.

249
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:29,100
Already Varalakshmi decided
to wash face with rain water.

250
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,900
Sister! It's raining.

251
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:38,900
Come.

252
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,100
It's getting late to go to college.
Come.

253
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,500
You too come.

254
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,500
Sister! Definitely you'll
become a heroine.

255
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:59,400
I am correct to Hollywood
but not to tallywood and bollywood.

256
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:03,100
Varalakshmi, Its raining heavy
Come fast.

257
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,700
Varalakshmi thought rain should come,
so rain has come.

258
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:09,400
Varalakshmi thought not to rain.

259
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,200
Did you see it?

260
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:25,300
Varalakshmi has come.
So rain won't come.

261
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,900
So what's the need to use umbrella.
Close it.

262
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,800
Do you have such a
confidence in you?

263
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:31,000
Yes, what I think, will happen.

264
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,900
- Then what if we think?
- Anything will happen.

265
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:38,300
<i>Don't kill me with your glance...</i>

266
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,400
He thinks he is Ravitheja...

267
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:48,300
<i>I got crazy without your love...</i>

268
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,500
- They seem to be from different states...
- They are going.

269
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,100
- She is from Maharashtra.
- She is from Utter Pradesh.

270
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:58,900
Look at Varalakshimi!
She looks like Shimla apple.

271
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:00,700
Don't you have sense?

272
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:03,300
You Tamil Nadu girl, Wait.
You're not fair to the level of your shout

273
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,300
He comments on you.

274
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:09,500
What he had said to you was a comment
But he is boasting me.

275
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:17,800
If she wears a sari,
we can see this Andhra Pradesh's beauty.

276
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,600
Varalakshmi is getting angry.

277
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,200
Now his crazy will get cured.

278
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:39,700
Things known is less,
Things unknown are lots. - To him or us?

279
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:47,300
Acting is like an ocean.

280
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,300
He is a small dust in it.

281
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,600
Are you kidding this Rajini hasan?

282
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,800
You come here.
You go and do your practice.

283
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:58,300
Do it like what I've done.

284
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:05,500
Greedy man and angry woman
won't come up well. Say it.

285
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,400
Angry woman...

286
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:10,100
Where is your reaction?

287
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,200
How I did and how you've done?

288
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,700
What's the difference
between yours and mine?

289
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,000
There is a difference like that
between man and doberman.

290
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:21,100
Whom should I select as hero
for coming month's talent search?

291
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,600
- Select me sir.
- What man? Come here.

292
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,200
What are the patches on your head?

293
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,300
I've applied lemon juice and shoe flower
oil for hair growth on my head...

294
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,800
...and I used so many medicines too.

295
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,100
- Do one thing?
- What sir?

296
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,600
Use cap. I am not able
to see you. Go away.

297
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:39,000
Don't ever dare at this Rajini Hasan.

298
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,200
I've drunk all acting skills
like mixed juice.

299
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,700
What is that movement?
Your movement should be like this.

300
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,800
Is Barathanatyam such difficult?

301
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:59,100
I am a bit late.

302
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,400
It's the first quality
needed to be a heroine.

303
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,900
What for is this?

304
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,400
To eat it.

305
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:13,400
Why do you give me this,
when so many people are here?

306
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,800
I have this one only.

307
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:21,400
- Move aside?
- Are you blind?

308
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,100
I want hero character.

309
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,400
Have you come with makeup already?

310
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,400
No, those are lock up hits.

311
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:29,200
Police gave some touch up to me.

312
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,800
What is my character in the program?

313
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:33,400
Script is ready for you.
Go and wear the spiderman dress.

314
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,900
- My face wouldn't appear.
- I'll manage it.

315
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:47,300
- We received your suit case.
- Is minister there?

316
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,900
- Are you fine? - How could I be fine
how long PR will be in this Hong Kong?

317
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,700
He wants share from every of my business.

318
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:58,400
He treats me like a fool
because I had worked with him.

319
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,600
I am scared about my brother on
what will happen if he fight with him.

320
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,400
But you are happily...

321
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,600
Nothing like that, I am very busy in
my daughter's marriage arrangements.

322
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:11,000
That's why I sent that gift
for your daughter's marriage.

323
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:15,200
- What about these girls?
- They are gift to you. - It's ok.

324
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:19,700
Look PA! I don't know whether
you'll put enquiry commission or not...

325
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:21,600
...use all rules that's in the Law...

326
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,600
...But PR should be in India in 2 days.

327
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,200
Do anything, otherwise...

328
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:29,300
If you can't do him anything,
leave him to me...

329
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:30,700
I'll kill him.

330
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:33,000
No, I'll do that.

331
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,300
Indian Embassy,
Hong Kong

332
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,400
PR(A)Pothu Raju

333
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:04,100
You developed your business
from brocket, arrack, cheap liquor...

334
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:07,200
...To fake notes, extortion,
illegal exports and shipping.

335
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:09,600
You've become to do business in Hong Kong.

336
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,700
Those are rumors.

337
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:13,200
All evidences are in Indian government.

338
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:14,600
We put enquiry commission on you.

339
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,100
Not only did you do mischief's in India...

340
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:17,800
...you are behaving as a Monarch here too

341
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,600
Home minister has taken
your case personally.

342
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,400
Isn't Home minister Ranga Reddy?

343
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,400
Isn't he arranging his daughter marriage?

344
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:24,900
He said to make
arrangements for your arrest.

345
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,800
There is no place for talks.
Here is the tickets.

346
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,200
We are starting in the evening.
Your time is over here.

347
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,600
Now, what's the time in India?

348
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,000
Oh gosh! What is this?

349
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:38,600
Where have you gone?

350
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,500
Who took this as a film?

351
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:46,300
It's a DVD quality.
How is it?

352
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,700
It's not looking like piracy, isn't it?

353
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:58,900
Our people are standing
at all TV channels with your DVD's.

354
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:00,600
What is this torture?

355
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,800
- Lf it is telecasted...
- I would act in condom ads for living.

356
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,700
No Seshu, what should I do?

357
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,400
You idiot! Speak in Telugu.

358
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:17,000
Go at once and beg to PR.

359
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,500
Otherwise take this phone
and put at his legs.

360
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,000
I'll beg myself.
- What happened sir?

361
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:26,600
In this age I can't act
in condom ads for living, that's why.

362
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,200
I will tell sorry to him.

363
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:37,100
Tell to minister that
PR won't come for others sake.

364
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,400
Only if he wants to come, he will.
What will you say?

365
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:44,600
If only PR wants to come, he will.
None can bring PR.

366
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:47,500
I like to hear my name in shivering voice.

367
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,000
Now you got hot.

368
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:56,000
Who worked as a broker
to me tried to cheat me.

369
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,900
Dog tails will always be like that.

370
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,000
Let us think about that brothers.

371
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:02,900
Two.

372
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:04,600
Three.

373
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,900
Who can play with me?

374
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,500
- Move aside.
- Brother! You've come in right time.

375
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,900
- What is this?
- Numbers game.

376
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,400
- Brother! He won 5,000 rupees of ours.
- Is it? - Yes.

377
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,800
Look! I'll give finishing touch now.

378
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:19,700
Come on, play.

379
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,800
- First keep your money there.
- Ok, I'II.

380
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,100
I meant original notes.

381
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:27,900
My lucky number is 1.

382
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,400
Mine is 6.

383
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,700
Don't know why Seshu is kidding me

384
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:38,700
After my work gets finished,
I wouldn't pay him a penny.

385
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,300
Brother! I am coming.
- He saved.

386
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:48,300
Otherwise he doesn't have
a wife as a pledge to the game.

387
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:53,700
Rao Neither pays the settlement agreed
nor picks up my call.

388
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,900
If PR knows this,
it'll create a problem.

389
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,400
Go and see his matter.

390
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,400
How did he win in every game?

391
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:08,800
Gosh!

392
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
He made a hole in this box
and made our pockets empty.

393
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,300
He is a fraud.

394
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:19,700
Artists didn't come from the sky.

395
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,400
They came from amidst the people.

396
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,600
Go and mingle with the people,

397
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:30,700
...learn variations and come.
But prefer your notes.

398
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:38,700
What should I do sir?

399
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:41,800
You are ogling at the girls.
Hence you are a blind person...

400
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:42,900
Sir! I am a blind person...

401
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,600
You are also a dumb person.

402
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,300
When you are in acting,
you should involve in your character.

403
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:51,800
Seeing my costume
everyone thinks me as a labour.

404
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,500
- Get this sack.
- Now, you can involve in the character.

405
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,700
When I woke up this morning,
I wanted to see the exhibition...

406
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,800
In the evening I saw the exhibition.

407
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,900
She is torturing us
telling about her luck.

408
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,700
Now we have to see her matter.

409
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,600
Even it costs us 1,000 rupees.

410
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,500
Ask him.

411
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:34,800
- Where is the parrot?
- Parrot?

412
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:37,800
He would have eaten.

413
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,100
What are this cards?

414
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:43,900
If you give me 100 rupees...

415
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:47,200
...I'll tell who will become
rich or not among you.

416
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:49,700
Do you have faith
in your prophecy? - Take your hand.

417
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,700
It depends on listeners.

418
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,400
Take out one card.

419
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:02,500
Had doctor died, when you was born?

420
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:04,900
Yes sir, he got heart attack

421
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:06,300
You take out one card.

422
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:17,800
You will be a damsel for your life.

423
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,000
Beauty! You take out one card.

424
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:33,400
Oh my mom!

425
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,200
Your's is not an ordinary fortune...

426
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,700
You are a lucky fortune girl.

427
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:39,200
Anything you think will happen...

428
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,900
You'll marry a rich person.

429
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,300
Leave me.
I beg you.

430
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,800
No, don't kill me.

431
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,900
Usually Rao cheats everybody.

432
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,400
But he is being beaten by someone.

433
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:57,200
- Hit him. - Nothing. They are
close friends. They are chatting.

434
00:32:57,300 --> 00:33:00,600
- You may go.
- Go away.

435
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:05,400
Your land problem got sloved...
and your business is going well.

436
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:07,300
- By whom?
- By PR.

437
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,500
Isn't it? Then why didn't
you pay the amount to him?

438
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:11,500
I'll give. I'll give him
keeping it with flowers.

439
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:15,700
If you don't pay him, I'll decorate
your corpse with that flowers.

440
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:16,900
Call him.

441
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:27,100
PR sir, It's me Rao speaking.

442
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:28,700
I'll settle your amount tomorrow.

443
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:30,600
He is aiming me with my pistol.
I feel scared.

444
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,300
- Ask him not to do it.
- Ok, give the phone to him. - I'll give.

445
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:39,900
- Hey Acid... - No, I am Kranthi.
I joined newly.

446
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,800
He said that he'll give the money.
Leave him.

447
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,800
Sir! I'll give it tomorrow.

448
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,100
- Lf you don't give the money,
I'll use this. - No sir.

449
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Beautiful girl.
I like her.

450
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,100
I'll fix her in our movie.

451
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,300
You too can fix it.
Oh God!

452
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:09,800
I decided.
So, you too can decide it.

453
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:22,100
- She looks like Hamsa(Swan).
- Does she look like that to you?

454
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:23,500
I've fixed it.

455
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:27,000
Is your name Hamsa?
- What is your torture?

456
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,500
It's your crazy that
girls like rough face guys.

457
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:34,700
- I am Kranthi.
- No, it's your crazy.

458
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:37,500
- His name is Kranthi.
- Is it Kanthri?

459
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:41,100
If it's for clarity, it's Kranthi.
If it's confusion, it's Kanthri.

460
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:43,700
Whatever is my name,
so is my character.

461
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:53,500
You shouldn't talk to him rashly.

462
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:02,000
Take out a card for free,
Because you hit Rao.

463
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:12,100
- He'll become a rich person.
- You are right.

464
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:13,600
Scratch and win...

465
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:15,500
World tour forjust Rs.100.

466
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:20,000
- Scratch something.
- No.

467
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,200
I'll definitely get a prize and
It's a routine to take it to home.

468
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,900
We have 24 branches in this State.

469
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,500
If everyone who scratches gets a prize...
We have to shutdown our business.

470
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,900
Come madam.
Try once.

471
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,200
Why do you stare at me?

472
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,700
You'll know who I am
after they scratch the card.

473
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,500
Our company will get Rs.500 profit.

474
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:43,800
You too give a try once.
We will close our shop a bit early.

475
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:45,400
Scratch it.

476
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:52,300
Do it fast.
We can't bear the suspense.

477
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,000
I've planned to attack Rao in the night.

478
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,900
- You do everything a bit late.
- Sir!

479
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,900
Seshu sir! It was done by mistake.

480
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:05,100
Here is your total payment.

481
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,900
From where did you bring Kanthri?

482
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:09,800
He aimed at my forehead.
Still I feel scared.

483
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,400
I called PR in a hurry...
Convey my apology to him.

484
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:15,100
Acid sir, everything will be right.
Bye sir.

485
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:17,900
- Call for PR...
- Acid, what is it?

486
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:22,300
- Greetings sir!
- What about payment?

487
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,800
- I gave him.
- Go away.

488
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,800
Gosh! He is deciding
everything by himself.

489
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:26,900
I don't know anything.

490
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:27,900
Wait, I'll see him.

491
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:32,000
Junior! You are over availing.
- Is it my hair?

492
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:34,000
I thought same as you.
I want to get my haircut.

493
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,400
What awful work have you done?

494
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:36,600
What are the difference
between you and Rao?

495
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:37,900
I didn't do any awful work.

496
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,300
None did that work.

497
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:42,100
Not only do I take money in advance,
But do jobs in advance as well.

498
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,500
Why did you call PR?

499
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,800
I aimed pistol at his eye.
He called him

500
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,100
You shouldn't directly deal with PR.

501
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:52,100
First you should inform me.
- Wait brother!

502
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,500
Junior! How did you know about Rao?

503
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,400
Didn't you and Seshu talk
in the room yesterday?

504
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:58,000
How could you listen
when we were talking in the room?

505
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:00,300
I can listen whatever
I can see with my sight.

506
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,900
Am I looking like a fool?

507
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Go and speak something in the room.
I'll tell if you are a fool or not?

508
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:06,200
Will you? I'll see what you can tell?

509
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,100
Kanthri became a big torture to me.

510
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:15,400
The salary is not enough
what Seshu gives me.

511
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:18,600
I thought to hide sum of money
from Rao's payment. But I couldn't...

512
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,500
If I believe this Seshu,
I can't get anything.

513
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:23,100
He spoke there.

514
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,300
Has he told?

515
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:31,200
Insufficient salary
and ugly face.

516
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,300
Brother! You are my God.

517
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,500
I talked like that because he can't find,
if I abuse God.

518
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:36,800

You instruct him.
After which he instructs us.

520
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,700
I knew that if Rao goes to Bombay,
he'll return after 10 days.

521
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:42,700
That's why I did like that.

522
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:49,300
- Did Rao settle our payment?
- Yes, he did.

523
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,400
Veeru and his brother's time are over.

524
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:53,400

You 3 people are going to Hong Kong.

531
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,100

532
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:13,100
- Get your passport ready.
- OK.

533
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:18,000
That's it Junior!
Though you did advance work...

534
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:20,000
these chances come to the seniority.

535
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:22,200
Are you in tension?

536
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,000
Be careful with me.

537
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,900
I'll tell about you to PR and
take you next time with me.

538
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:29,900
Sir! Switch on the speaker phone.

- Seshu.
- Tell me PR.

541
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,200
Don't send Acid.
He talks more and do less work.

542
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:40,600
Who is that boy that dealt Rao's payment?

543
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:48,500
He seems a bit fast.
Send him.

544
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,900
Will you take me with you?

545
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,500
- It looks like Volvo bus.

Both of us are traveling in one flight.

551
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,800
Kranthi! How lucky you are!

552
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,800
- Varalakshmi Dear!
- Who is he?

553
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,900
I feel pity seeing all of them.

554
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,500
They would have spent more money
to get tickets, isn't it dear?

555
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:45,100
- Dad! No one is as lucky as me.
- You are right.

556
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,200
Your dad? Which means he'll be my uncle.

557
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,400
Wait a minute.

558
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:51,200
My name is Kranthi.

559
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:54,500
I am a friend of Varalakshmi.

560
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,900
I am doing quality checking
in PR exports.

561
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:58,200
Yes, it's a big company.

562

564
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,900
If any problem arises,
tell to my assistant.

565
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:10,200
- Am I his assistant?
- Am I then?

566
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000

00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:29,300
Oh! It's a big airport.

570
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,200
See! There is a man holding Telugu banner.
- Dear! It's for us.

571
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:35,700
Seems they would have scratched the card.

572
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:36,800
They are waving their hands.

573
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:39,200
Fold it and keep inside.
Get the car ready.

574
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:43,000
Have you organized all arrangements well?

575

- Why do you say all this?
- Seems he lives on lucky draw.

577
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:56,500
In which draw you got him?

578
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,600
These days I spent
2 lakh rupees to get him.

579
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:01,500
Whenever you go to buy something
for money, you have to watch carefully.

580
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:02,700
He looks like an antique.

581
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,400
And he wore safari dress like a gun man.

582
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:07,200
Junior! Where are you going?

583
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:09,500
You both should wait here.

to see my darling.

585
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:13,100

00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:36,000
Nothing. People scratch the card and win.

00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:37,900
They will come here
and I'll roam with them.

597
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:39,500
No one gives me a single penny.

598
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:43,100
If you want to meet me in Singapore, .
Take this, my visiting card.

599
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:46,100
He will go to Hong Kong.

She is going. Brother! Don't wait.
Come. I'll come.

Didn't I give him my visiting card?
He found me out.

606
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:09,900
Uncle! Any how my flight is late.

607
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:11,900
I wanted to see Singapore

608
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:15,900
- He didn't want to see Singapore.
- Then, he wanted to see your family.

609
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:17,500
This is our family trip.

610
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:19,600
It's a free trip to your family.

00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:21,000

Breakfast is good.

620
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,400
Bill for food is yours.
My company won't pay for it.

621

- Don't take lucky dip here.
- Why?

Yes, elephant is very dangerous.

631

Yes, They have built glasses
beneath the fish ponds.

639
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:42,300
If Singapore government listens it,
they'll put you in the museum.

00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:45,000
- Lf they want to listen it, what to do?

00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,500
This is not an ordinary family.

643

- I'll ask them madam.
- Fishes? Go away.

644

00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:10,700
Come here!

647
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:12,600
Put down your hand.
Not for money.

648
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,600
Are there mesmerizing girls over here?

He feels very joy
seeing birds fly.

651
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:29,600
Don't know when will he fly with
his daughter, then only he'll get cut.

652
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:33,600
Those are cranes.
Those could be found in India as well.

653
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:36,400
- Are swans here?
- I haven't seen yet.

654
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:38,500
I like swan very much.

Varalakshmi as Hamsa. - Yes.

660
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:54,400

smile at me or smile yourself.

661
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:57,100
Swans seperate water and rock.

662
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:59,000
His concentration is not on your talk...

663
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:00,700
Stop it.
Ok bye.

664
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:03,300
This is fountain of well.

665
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:06,000
These 4 buildings around it
are like 4 fingers.

666
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:07,500
They built it seeing tutelary norms

667
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:09,100
That's why Singapore earn more profit.

668
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:11,400
If we build fountains and buildings
like these in Hyderabad...

669
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:13,700
...will it change as Singapore?
Shut up.

670
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:15,200
You are blabbering at us what you like.

671
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:16,800
Why do we bother him?
Come, let's go aside.

672
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:20,100
He doesn't know the difference
between Madhapore and Singapore.

673
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:23,000
- My uncle.
- Have you fixed it?

674
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:28,700

You are right.
What should I do now?

678
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:40,300
You should go for shopping.

679
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:43,300
If you have dollars, you can change as

<i>Thinking disgusting, .
<i>What have you done dear???</i>

685
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:54,200
<i>To spoil my mind.</i>

686
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:59,700
<i>Don't bother.</i>
<i>None will notice us.</i>

687
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:03,000
<i>You need not worry.</i>

688
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:08,200
<i>What can I say if others enquire?</i>

689
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:14,300
<i>How to show them my paining heart?</i>

690
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:19,200
<i>Don't know what would happen</i>
<i>in this state of stupor</i>

691
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:25,300
<i>Will you become a Romeo</i>
<i>thinking of me?</i>

692
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:33,700
<i>You say that you don't feel</i>
<i>the same way like me...</i>

693
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:38,200
<i>Should I believe what you say?</i>

694
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:42,500
<i>If you don't believe me,</i>
<i>I just laugh to myself...</i>

695
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:46,800
<i>Won't you accept that</i>
<i>I didn't think about you?</i>

696
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:51,200
<i>After seeing you,</i>
<i>I lost my mind.</i>

697
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:55,600
<i>Truth is always bitter</i>
<i>lts not your fault</i>

698
00:48:55,900 --> 00:49:00,000
<i>Don't blame me like that.</i>

699
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:58,200
<i>Many girls prettier than you are here...</i>

700
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:02,600
<i>Have I ever seen them?</i>

701
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:04,800
<i>I didn't say 'No'</i>

702
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
<i>I think it's my luck</i>

703
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:11,300
<i>Should I think all</i>
<i>my prayers came like you?</i>

704
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:15,700
<i>My fate was written</i>
<i>before you were born</i>

705
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:20,100
<i>Hence, I was m born for you</i>
<i>in this earth, oh dear!</i>

706
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:24,300
<i>Don't mesmerise me with your talk.</i>

707
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:32,000
I will meet in Hyderabad.

708
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:37,800
I think PR would have come.

709
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:44,300
Is he PR?
He looks like a sorcerer

710
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:46,900
Hello sir!

711
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:49,700
I will come to the point.

712
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,300
PR wants this.
- Give it to him.

713
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:53,700
Why did you show to us?

714
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:56,200
Not photo. He wants him.

715
00:50:57,300 --> 00:50:59,100
Where is he? I will catch him.

716
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:00,400
Its is not that easy.

717
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:02,700
He maintains a separate gang
after he parted from PR.

718
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:04,300
...and he killed 20 of our people.

719
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:05,800
All the time his brother takes drugs.

720
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:08,000
He knows PR's peoples

721
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:09,500
He has tight security.

722
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:11,100
That's why I am sending you.

723
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:12,400
You have to enter like a worker.

724
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:14,400
PR wants him alive.

725
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:32,000
Come.
Get in.

726
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:08,900
Biragi is caught.
We will leave him.

727
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:09,800
You go back.

728
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:55,800
Do you think of making
your brother as No.1 by killing me?

729
00:55:56,300 --> 00:55:58,600
Do you think that is as easy as
smelling cocaine?

730
00:55:59,100 --> 00:56:01,400
Separate gang, torture...

731
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:04,800
Your brother raised
his voice by seeing you.

732
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:09,200
Let me see what will he raise
by knowing that you under my leg.

733
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:20,900
Is this call to his brother?

734
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:24,300
One minute.

735
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:35,700
When did he catch him?

736
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:38,000
Why should I come again
from Hyderabad because of him?

737
00:56:38,100 --> 00:56:39,500
That's why I brought him.

738
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,500
Why through phone? Speak directly.

739
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:49,100
I like your speed.

740
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:50,600
What is your name?

741
00:56:56,100 --> 00:57:00,200
At first you came to Hong kong
you joined as a pimp in my gang.

742
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:02,400
Now Minister level broker...

743
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:07,200
Do you think it's easy to kill P. R
like you supply the girls?

744
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:11,700
I know you won't allow us to live.

745
00:57:11,900 --> 00:57:14,700
I only did planning, execution.
So you kill me.

746
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:18,000
My brother is a kid.

747
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:19,600
Don't kill him.
Leave him.

748
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:24,300
Show your enmity on me.

749
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:26,000
My enmity is on you.

750
00:57:26,700 --> 00:57:29,100
How will my enmity come to an end,
if I kill you

751
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:30,800
You will die in a second.

752
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:48,500
Brother, why did you play with PR?

753
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:50,300
He has killed me, brother.

754
00:57:52,700 --> 00:57:55,000
This is satisfaction of enmity.

755
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:59,600
PR Killed my brother, should be your cry
so long as you live.

756
00:58:25,100 --> 00:58:28,200
Oh God! By seeing P. R's rage
I didn't get stupor.

757
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:32,000
- How much is his property?
- 1000 crores.

758
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:37,900
When will you come to Hyderabad?

759
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:42,400
- Why? - To fix my second
marriage engagement. - Shit!

760
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:46,300
Why do you need marriage?
You have to enjoy with girls.

761
00:58:52,700 --> 00:58:55,000
- From where did you bring him?
- I had brought him.

762
00:58:55,100 --> 00:58:56,800
I gave him training
for 3months in my style.

763
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:01,400
He is orphan.

764
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:04,300
But he has craziness.

765
00:59:09,300 --> 00:59:10,500
You...

766
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:12,700
I like you.

767
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,900
I have been
like you in your age.

768
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:20,400
Ask whatever you want?

769
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:22,900
Girls, money...

770
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:25,700
Boss! We brought him giving advance.

771
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:28,200
Brother is asking you, isn't it?
Tell him.

772
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:32,200
Tell me, what do you want?

773
00:59:41,900 --> 00:59:43,300
Do you want the chair?

774
00:59:44,300 --> 00:59:47,600
Not the chair, But that position.

775
00:59:51,900 --> 00:59:56,200
- Did you booze more? - Without
boozing itself I would be in stupor.

776
00:59:56,900 --> 00:59:59,600
Whatever is the field
I have to become a top in position.

777
00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:02,400
That is the top position in our field.

778
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:04,300
If you give that one
I won't take that.

779
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:06,200
I will earn myself.

780
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,900
By seeing what that
you have such a confidence?

781
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:12,000
By seeing myself.

782
01:00:13,300 --> 01:00:14,800
I won't get inspired by seeing someone.

783
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:16,200
I am the inspiration to myself.

784
01:00:16,300 --> 01:00:18,300
Biragi, he doesn't know the difference
between younger and elder.

785
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:19,300
He doesn't mind anyone.

786
01:00:24,900 --> 01:00:26,100
I like you.

787
01:00:26,300 --> 01:00:28,100
You stay here for a week
and enjoy yourself.

788
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:29,600
I have to go tomorrow.

789
01:00:30,700 --> 01:00:33,600
Children are waiting for me.
- Children?

790
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:36,800
That is a big orphanage.
They all are arrogant.

791
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,100
We will go.
I have my marriage engagements.

792
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:45,700
I like you.

793
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,900
Sister, I forgot to give you.
Kranthi asked me to give you.

794
01:00:53,300 --> 01:00:54,100
Go away.

795
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:58,500
Plats, furniture,
Singapore trip all are finished.

796
01:00:58,600 --> 01:01:01,200
Try a car in your another draw.

797
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:02,400
I will try.

798
01:01:03,100 --> 01:01:05,200
Dear, It may rain.
Take this Umbrella.

799
01:01:05,700 --> 01:01:08,800
Varalakshmi is going
Rain won't come.

800
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:19,800
Gosh!

801
01:01:20,300 --> 01:01:21,500
Why are you shocked?

802
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:24,200
Its Raining. Didn't you bring
the umbrella. That's it.

803
01:01:24,300 --> 01:01:27,700
- Ok, how was your Singapore trip?
- It's ok.

804
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:37,700
What? I think rain is coming for you.

805
01:01:37,900 --> 01:01:39,600
Yes, it's like that.

806
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:47,200
Oh princess!

807
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:49,000
I like you Nizam beauty.

808
01:01:49,100 --> 01:01:51,300
You went to Singapore.
Why didn't you tell me about it?

809
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:54,600
See! How I have become thin
waiting for you since one week.

810
01:01:54,700 --> 01:01:56,300
Hey, why did you speak like my would-be?

811
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:58,900
Did you hear that? Although she is
in emotion, she called me her would-be.

812
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,000
But she didn't call me as brother.

813
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:02,400
That means she has
some feelings over me.

814
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:08,400
Varalakshmi is getting angry.
- Sachin too is getting moody.

815
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:10,500
Police have gone already.

816
01:02:11,100 --> 01:02:12,500
Urgently, I want to meet Lee.

817
01:02:15,700 --> 01:02:16,900
Did you get Singapore trip?

818
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
The shop keeper yelled.
- Trip was nice.

819
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:20,400
After that...

820
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:22,700
Everything changed reverse.

821
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:26,800
Take one card.

822
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:36,600
Take another one.

823
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:46,500
Oh my bad dad who is in Chennai!

824
01:02:47,300 --> 01:02:48,400
What happened?

825
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:49,800
I am also asking that same question.

826
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:52,400
What had happened in Singapore trip?

827
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:55,800
Wasn't a person who hit
the owner that day? Kranthi...

828
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:58,000
Yes, that powerful guy.

829
01:02:59,300 --> 01:03:01,000
He also came with us in same flight.

830
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:03,100
He made me get irritated.

831
01:03:03,700 --> 01:03:05,100
Except that,
everything was ok.

832
01:03:05,300 --> 01:03:09,800
What had happened between
your departure and arrival?

833
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:13,200
In my life, I gave him my first kiss.

834
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:17,900
After that weather changed to worst.

835
01:03:22,900 --> 01:03:24,100
Did he kiss you?

836
01:03:24,700 --> 01:03:26,800
No, it was me.

837
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:28,900
It was me.

838
01:03:35,700 --> 01:03:38,600
Here kiss pain and
there kiss gain.

839
01:03:38,900 --> 01:03:40,300
He is not an ordinary man.

840
01:03:42,300 --> 01:03:43,300
In one kiss...

841
01:03:44,700 --> 01:03:46,200
...He pulled your power.

842
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:48,300
I thought

843
01:03:48,900 --> 01:03:50,500
I thought when I met him...

844
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:53,700
...Varalakshmi is not comfortable.

845
01:03:54,900 --> 01:03:56,100
What should I do now?

846
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:58,100
This is not in 'A' sacred book.

847
01:03:58,300 --> 01:03:59,600
I'm telling by my experience.

848
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:03,100
You lost your power for a kiss...

849
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:07,600
...So you can get back it in another kiss.

850
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:10,300
Should she kiss him again?
How?

851
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:12,200
Come, I'll show you.
Like this.

852
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:14,600
- Ok, I'll kiss him.
- Do it.

853
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:16,500
I'll get my luck back.
- Ok.

854
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:23,400
Oh beauty! Come.
I'll write China to you.

855
01:04:23,900 --> 01:04:25,000
Oh dear!

856
01:04:26,100 --> 01:04:27,200
Let me see my luck.

857
01:04:28,900 --> 01:04:31,500
<i>Oh dear!</i>

858
01:04:31,700 --> 01:04:35,600
<i>I am lying in the lap</i>
of tides, expecting you!

859
01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:36,600
<i>Oh dear!</i>

860
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:43,600
I am Rambo sister-in-law!

861
01:04:43,700 --> 01:04:45,500
- Sister-in-law?
- Yes sisters.

862
01:04:45,900 --> 01:04:46,700
Sisters?

863
01:04:47,700 --> 01:04:50,400
Our Kranthi told me to call,
average figure as sister...

864
01:04:50,500 --> 01:04:53,700
...and extra ordinary as sister-in-law.

865
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:54,900
He would.

866
01:04:55,100 --> 01:04:58,800
We've come for social service camp
from HCM college.

867
01:04:59,300 --> 01:05:02,600
We brought tamarind rice and
curd rice for you all to eat.

868
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:05,400
Aren't elders here?
Like Kranthi...

869
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:07,100
They will come in the evening.

870
01:05:07,300 --> 01:05:09,600
You come bringing
tamarind rice and curd rice...

871
01:05:09,700 --> 01:05:11,900
...in the name of social service camp.

872
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:13,700
We are not storm affected people...

873
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:14,900
We are orphans.

874
01:05:15,100 --> 01:05:17,700
We don't have parents to ask our needs.

875
01:05:17,900 --> 01:05:19,100
We are God's children.

876
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,300
Who will give these items to us?

877
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:26,300
- Who will give us?
- We will give you.

878
01:05:26,700 --> 01:05:29,400
We will give you including Kranthi.

879
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:30,700
Note it down sister-in-law.

880
01:05:36,100 --> 01:05:37,300
That which is
your Kranthi's favorite dish?

881
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:39,800
He likes halwa with dry grapes in it.

882
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:42,400
Bring it by evening.
We'll eat and bless you.

883
01:05:42,500 --> 01:05:44,200
- Go.
- Walk fast.

884
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,300
Where are the items?
I am feeling very hungry?

885
01:05:55,700 --> 01:05:56,700
What happened to them?

886
01:05:57,100 --> 01:05:58,500
For what are you waiting?

887
01:05:58,800 --> 01:06:03,000
Brother! Afternoon, 4 sisters and
1 sister-in-law came to meet you.

888
01:06:03,100 --> 01:06:04,700
Sister-in-law's name is Varalakshmi.

889
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:06,500
They are bringing good food items for us.

890
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:07,400
Your darling!

891
01:06:08,300 --> 01:06:09,400
What fate is this to us?

892
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:11,400
It's our bad time, Rani.
No chance.

893
01:06:13,100 --> 01:06:14,300
It has come.

894
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:16,900
Item has come.

895
01:06:17,500 --> 01:06:19,200
Haven't you brought all items
what is in the list?

896
01:06:19,900 --> 01:06:20,700
Go and check it out.

897
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:23,400
Dear! I want a biriyani with leg piece.

898
01:06:23,500 --> 01:06:24,600
Let's eat after finishing the prayer.

899
01:06:24,700 --> 01:06:26,500
Is prayer the need of this moment?

900
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:30,800
You looks like Madona...

901
01:06:30,900 --> 01:06:33,100
...You have Mother Theresa's affection
which can't be visible.

902
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:35,500
I'll wait there.

903
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:43,500
Jesus! Give peace
to the souls of prawn, fish...

904
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:48,300
...hen and goat
that they lost their lives for us.

905
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:49,400
Eat now.

906
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:00,700
Have you mixed properly?

907
01:07:01,500 --> 01:07:04,200
I have mixed 4 sleeping pills
in each food packet.

908
01:07:04,500 --> 01:07:06,400
They will sleep in 5 minutes
after finish eating.

909
01:07:06,500 --> 01:07:08,300
You can go and do your work.

910
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:17,000
Halwa with kiss miss.

911
01:07:21,600 --> 01:07:22,700
Is it social service?

912
01:07:27,100 --> 01:07:28,500
Kiss taste is superb.

913
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:31,400
Kiss miss taste is superb.

914
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:33,400
Tell me the truth.

915
01:07:33,700 --> 01:07:35,100
You've done these all for me, right?

916
01:07:52,100 --> 01:07:53,600
Kiss him and come fast.

917
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:57,200
Come.

918
01:08:39,700 --> 01:08:44,800
Usually ladies will get first chance.
- You got second chance too.

919
01:08:45,100 --> 01:08:47,100
Didn't you get intoxicated?

920
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:50,300
I got intoxicated
but dose was not enough.

921
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:51,800
You thief!

922
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:54,800
Kissing me while in sleep is not right

923
01:08:54,900 --> 01:08:56,700
Come, let's kiss now.

924
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:58,100
- No.
- Come.

925
01:09:21,300 --> 01:09:26,200
<i>Your tsunami youth has touched me,</i>
<i>I can't wait, dear!</i>

926
01:09:26,900 --> 01:09:31,600
<i>Come and caress my beauty</i>
<i>and play your wish.</i>

927
01:09:32,500 --> 01:09:37,100
<i>Drench me with your kisses.</i>

928
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:43,200
<i>Sweet cheeks are here.</i>
<i>Enjoy it.</i>

929
01:09:43,300 --> 01:09:50,000
<i>Beauty! I fell in your magic beauty.</i>

930
01:09:50,200 --> 01:09:56,600
<i>Sweetie! I toppled over in that magic.</i>

931
01:10:30,700 --> 01:10:36,400
<i>Dear! I got stuck into you</i>
<i>on my way.</i>

932
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:44,600
<i>Don't feel shy and bothered.</i>

933
01:10:44,900 --> 01:10:50,300
<i>You are my hunter!</i>
<i>Come and hunt this beauty.</i>

934
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:55,300
<i>You are my beauty</i>
<i>to wait for my hunt.</i>

935
01:10:55,400 --> 01:10:59,900
<i>Cupid! After you start the play,</i>
<i>I won't ask you to stop.</i>

936
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,400
<i>Your tsunami youth...</i>

937
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:41,600
<i>I'll come and peck your eyes.</i>
<i>Don't glance at me</i>

938
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:49,900
<i>I'll come and hug you.</i>
<i>Feel happy with our pair.</i>

939
01:11:50,100 --> 01:11:55,500
<i>You made me crazy with your beauty.</i>
<i>Make me happy.</i>

940
01:11:55,700 --> 01:12:00,600
<i>This beauty is yours,</i>
<i>come and enjoy it.</i>

941
01:12:00,700 --> 01:12:05,100
<i>I liked your beauty.</i>
<i>Pretty! You are advanced.</i>

942
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:51,400
Brother!

943
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:01,700
Chinna!

944
01:13:35,300 --> 01:13:36,900
Chinna's both kidneys are damaged.

945
01:13:38,100 --> 01:13:39,300
It can't be cured by medicine.

946
01:13:39,900 --> 01:13:40,700
Dialysis has be done to him

947
01:13:41,100 --> 01:13:42,400
We should give him
treatment keeping in the hospital.

948
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:43,800
10 lakh rupees will be needed for that.

949
01:13:47,900 --> 01:13:49,100
I'll get it within evening.

950
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,200
Brother, -Hmm...
- What sin have these dollars done?

951
01:13:54,500 --> 01:13:55,800
Shall we print it too?

952
01:13:56,500 --> 01:13:58,000
PR is Patriotic towards his country.

953
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:01,000
Gosh! He is coming.

954
01:14:02,300 --> 01:14:03,400
Sir is in work.
Wait here.

955
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:07,400
When he stopped you outside,
why didn't you obey it?

956
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:09,100
We are in important work.
Can't you see?

957
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:12,100
I have work with Seshu Bai.

958
01:14:13,300 --> 01:14:16,500
Bai! Our Chinna is admitted
in the hospital for kidney problem.

959
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:18,100
We want 10 lakh rupees urgently.

960
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:20,100
My grandma too is not well.

961
01:14:20,500 --> 01:14:21,800
I am senior person over here.
Did I ask him?

962
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:24,900
Is this a government office to you?

963
01:14:25,500 --> 01:14:27,100
To give health insurance and fund.

964
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:28,000
It's very urgent Bai.

965
01:14:28,500 --> 01:14:29,500
Else he will die.

966
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:30,700
Let him die.

967
01:14:30,900 --> 01:14:32,400
One orphan will die, that's all.

968
01:14:33,100 --> 01:14:33,900
Expenses would reduce.

969
01:14:34,300 --> 01:14:35,800
If he was your son,
will you say like this?

970
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:37,500
Why your tone is rising?

971
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:40,600
Its not that, that day PR
praised him in Hong Kong.

972
01:14:40,700 --> 01:14:42,000
We may look like fools to him.

973
01:14:42,200 --> 01:14:44,100
There he asked for chair.
And Here he is asking for money.

974
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:48,200
Will you give me or not?

975
01:14:48,700 --> 01:14:49,600
Are you threatening us?

976
01:14:50,300 --> 01:14:51,600
Can't we run
this gang without you?

977
01:14:51,800 --> 01:14:53,700
If you run the gang without me...

978
01:14:53,900 --> 01:14:56,000
...then Kranthi will act without a gang.

979
01:14:57,500 --> 01:14:58,500
I want money.

980
01:14:59,100 --> 01:15:00,800
I've dismissed him from the gang.

981
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,700
Risk, blood and hard work is ours.

982
01:15:25,100 --> 01:15:27,300
Earning crores of money
through our hard work...

983
01:15:27,500 --> 01:15:28,500
...won't you help us when we need?

984
01:15:32,200 --> 01:15:35,600
- Take money and put in the suit case.
- I'II. - 10 lakh rupees.

985
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:37,000
I am putting.

986
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:39,300
- Otherwise I'll kill him.
- Don't do anything.

987
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:41,700
Take it.

988
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:44,400
Come.

989
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:46,400
Come.

990
01:15:55,800 --> 01:15:57,800
In future, all of you would
also face a similar situation

991
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:02,200
I'll maintain separate gang from today.

992
01:16:02,900 --> 01:16:04,000
If you wish,
you can come with me.

993
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:05,400
What will happen if PR knows it?

994
01:16:06,500 --> 01:16:10,600
Not only PR,
none can do anything to me.

995
01:16:24,700 --> 01:16:25,600
See, who is it?

996
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:28,200
- I am Bairagi speaking.
- Tell me Bairagi.

997
01:16:28,300 --> 01:16:30,500
Kranthi came here and quarreled with us.

998
01:16:38,100 --> 01:16:39,400
- Lf we want to do anything...
- Give me.

999
01:16:39,800 --> 01:16:42,500
Had I been in Seshu place,
I would've drank acid and died

1000
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:44,000
He is very strong,
that's why he is alive.

1001
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:46,600
Some people live a meanly life

1002
01:16:49,300 --> 01:16:52,800
Kranthi quarreled with Seshu
and started a new gang.

1003
01:16:53,100 --> 01:16:54,600
Situation is very bad.

1004
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:58,600
He is very speed like me.

1005
01:16:58,900 --> 01:17:00,300
- Call his number.
I'll talk him. - Tell me.

1006
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:04,600
I heard that you started
a new gang there.

1007
01:17:05,300 --> 01:17:06,800
You don't have that chance.

1008
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,400
Go and say sorry to Seshu
and join in the work as usual.

1009
01:17:09,800 --> 01:17:11,300
I won't give 2 chance to anyone.

1010
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:13,600
Rascal! I liked you.

1011
01:17:13,700 --> 01:17:16,300
- That's why I give you...
- You don't have that chance too.

1012
01:17:16,700 --> 01:17:18,600
Already I have decided and got advance.

1013
01:17:19,300 --> 01:17:20,700
Now I don't belong to your gang.

1014
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:23,600
What will you do taking that advance?

1015
01:17:24,700 --> 01:17:27,300
Will you kidnap school children
or do extortion?

1016
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:30,800
It's not so easy
to maintain gang against me.

1017
01:17:30,900 --> 01:17:32,800
I got advance for your head.

1018
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:40,100
One crore rupees.

1019
01:17:40,600 --> 01:17:42,500
None will remain in your gang.

1020
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,100
It's the climax of your cinema.

1021
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:52,100
Does he know to whom is he talking?

1022
01:17:52,300 --> 01:17:56,300
I know well to whom
and what I am talking?

1023
01:17:56,400 --> 01:17:57,900
I know very well about you.

1024
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,200
You do remote control
sitting in Hong Kong.

1025
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:04,600
You don't have guts,
that's why you called me there.

1026
01:18:05,900 --> 01:18:09,000
I don't know from where
or from whom would I start.

1027
01:18:09,900 --> 01:18:11,600
- Dass!
- What dear!

1028
01:18:12,100 --> 01:18:14,700
PR and his gang are done with.

1029
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:21,200
He talked to him
like how he deals with children.

1030
01:18:21,500 --> 01:18:24,400
I have been trying
to kill PR for the past 20 years.

1031
01:18:24,500 --> 01:18:25,700
But I couldn't succeed.

1032
01:18:25,900 --> 01:18:28,800
Dear! You must work with us.

1033
01:18:28,900 --> 01:18:30,800
This is just an advance.

1034
01:18:31,200 --> 01:18:34,600
I've kept this new gun for him
after placing it before God's altar.

1035
01:18:34,700 --> 01:18:36,400
Here are bullets.

1036
01:18:36,900 --> 01:18:38,100
Kill him new style.

1037
01:18:52,200 --> 01:18:53,300
PR has come.

1038
01:18:58,200 --> 01:18:59,900
Dass got a range to give
advance for my head.

1039
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:01,600
But you couldn't do him anything.
Waste guys.

1040
01:19:01,700 --> 01:19:05,100
Not only Dass, there are so many people.

1041
01:19:05,200 --> 01:19:07,400
But only one guy who has guts came
to accept the deal.

1042
01:19:07,500 --> 01:19:09,900
Dass didn't call him.
But Kranthi went there by himself.

1043
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,300
That's why we should kill him in advance.

1044
01:19:12,700 --> 01:19:16,000
His death should make shiver everyone
who will dare to oppose PR.

1045
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:18,400
- Tell me.
- They can't kill him.

1046
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:20,200
Call a toughie

1047
01:19:21,300 --> 01:19:22,400
Ask him to hunt him.

1048
01:19:22,600 --> 01:19:25,500
I want to kill him watching
fear in his eyes.

1049
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:26,600
Ok.

1050
01:19:27,300 --> 01:19:28,900
Do hunt carefully.

1051
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:30,700
He is not an animal
but he is a hunter.

1052
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:32,900
I want him alive.

1053
01:19:35,700 --> 01:19:38,700
I will wait for you at city square mall.

1054
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:39,800
Whom are you asking to come over here?

1055
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:43,800
After he comes here,
will you kiss him and flee?

1056
01:19:44,100 --> 01:19:45,500
What is your plan this time?

1057
01:19:47,500 --> 01:19:50,300
- I have fixed him.
- Only for one kiss.

1058
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:54,500
Not only one kiss.
We completed it three times.

1059
01:19:55,200 --> 01:19:58,500
Leave kiss.
He liked me very much.

1060
01:19:58,600 --> 01:20:00,600
Don't know but I liked him.

1061
01:20:00,700 --> 01:20:03,400
You are suitable to him,
But will he suitable to you?

1062
01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:05,300
There are no logics.

1063
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:07,100
I want him.

1064
01:20:10,100 --> 01:20:11,300
I asked him to come here to tell that.

1065
01:20:24,300 --> 01:20:25,300
Come.

1066
01:20:27,200 --> 01:20:28,600
- Go away.
- Come, let's go.

1067
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:20,200
Kranthi brother! I am feeling scared.

1068
01:22:20,300 --> 01:22:21,800
Someone is aiming with gun at me.

1069
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:27,700
PR has no weaknesses and sentiments.

1070
01:22:27,800 --> 01:22:29,700
Come and die.

1071
01:22:29,800 --> 01:22:33,000
I thought PR is a man till now.

1072
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:34,600
I am coming...

1073
01:22:51,700 --> 01:22:52,600
Wait.

1074
01:22:52,900 --> 01:22:54,500
I want to kill him with my hands.

1075
01:22:54,700 --> 01:22:55,900
I've decided.

1076
01:22:57,400 --> 01:23:00,100
I'll kill you in one second before I die.

1077
01:23:00,700 --> 01:23:02,100
I've decided it.

1078
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:11,900
Don't you feel scared.

1079
01:23:13,500 --> 01:23:15,600
You aimed at PR.

1080
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:19,800
I know that but
my bullets doesn't know it

1081
01:23:20,100 --> 01:23:22,500
If I trigger it,
it'll kill anyone.

1082
01:23:24,200 --> 01:23:25,700
Do you have such arrogance?

1083
01:23:26,700 --> 01:23:28,500
I should kill you.

1084
01:23:28,700 --> 01:23:29,800
Pothuraju!

1085
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:38,800
Yes, you are Pothuraju.

1086
01:23:40,900 --> 01:23:42,700
Do you know
whom you are going to kill?

1087
01:23:43,300 --> 01:23:44,500
To your son.

1088
01:23:45,900 --> 01:23:49,300
Yes Pothuraju, Kranthi is your son.

1089
01:23:54,700 --> 01:23:56,000
Barathi is your wife. Isn't it?

1090
01:23:58,800 --> 01:23:59,700
Yes dear!

1091
01:24:00,600 --> 01:24:01,500
Wait a minute.

1092
01:24:11,400 --> 01:24:12,500
Look at this photo!

1093
01:24:52,300 --> 01:24:53,800
He killed my mother.

1094
01:24:54,900 --> 01:24:57,200
My mother died because of him.

1095
01:24:58,000 --> 01:24:59,400
I should kill him.

1096
01:25:00,400 --> 01:25:01,700
Will you kill your own father?

1097
01:25:01,800 --> 01:25:05,600
No Father! My mother got into
troubles because of him.

1098
01:25:06,100 --> 01:25:08,000
- He left her alone.
- No dear!

1099
01:25:08,100 --> 01:25:10,300
Whom I wished
not to meet in my life...

1100
01:25:10,400 --> 01:25:12,800
Now I have met him.
- Listen to me.

1101
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:14,500
- I should kill him.
- No dear!

1102
01:25:20,500 --> 01:25:22,100
You are saved.

1103
01:25:46,700 --> 01:25:48,000
I couldn't believe it.

1104
01:25:48,900 --> 01:25:51,000
After 20 years your son...

1105
01:25:51,100 --> 01:25:52,700
I forgot that I have a son.

1106
01:25:56,300 --> 01:25:58,200
I never thought that
he would aim to kill me.

1107
01:25:58,500 --> 01:26:00,100
What God has told is...

1108
01:26:01,100 --> 01:26:05,500
If you miss anything,
it will seek you.

1109
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:14,000
Dear! When I was working
at a mission hospital in Vizag...

1110
01:26:14,300 --> 01:26:18,100
...Your small child Kranthi and your
ailing wife came there and go admitted.

1111
01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:21,500
Despite our best treatment
her illness didn't get cured

1112
01:26:21,900 --> 01:26:24,200
She became mentally ill...

1113
01:26:24,500 --> 01:26:26,500
...and died in our Premalayam.

1114
01:26:26,900 --> 01:26:30,700
Before her death she gave me Kranthi.

1115
01:26:31,500 --> 01:26:35,900
And asked me to swear that
I shoudn't tell about his dad to him.

1116
01:26:36,500 --> 01:26:39,800
Since Kranthi grew up
at our Premalayam.

1117
01:26:40,100 --> 01:26:44,100
But he thought that no orphan
should worry like him

1118
01:26:44,600 --> 01:26:46,200
That's why he worked for us.

1119
01:26:46,600 --> 01:26:48,400
Your son is a good man.

1120
01:26:50,100 --> 01:26:53,400
He is hostile with you because you're
the reason for his mom's death.

1121
01:26:53,900 --> 01:26:58,200
That's why he became emotional that day.

1122
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:00,600
Today is his mom's death day.

1123
01:27:01,300 --> 01:27:02,900
He will stay in his mom's tomb.

1124
01:27:22,600 --> 01:27:24,800
- Hey, dear.
- No.

1125
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:27,400
She is in a peaceful state after she died

1126
01:27:28,600 --> 01:27:29,600
Let her be like that.

1127
01:27:30,700 --> 01:27:32,800
For your happiness
you left her.

1128
01:27:33,700 --> 01:27:37,400
All these days, did you think
about me and my mom?

1129
01:27:37,700 --> 01:27:39,100
- She didn't want to live with me
- No.

1130
01:27:40,100 --> 01:27:41,600
- Don't tell anything.
- Dear!

1131
01:27:42,100 --> 01:27:44,100
- He is repenting.
- No father.

1132
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:46,200
I won't believe his crocodile tears.

1133
01:27:47,500 --> 01:27:49,900
I agreed to kill you
when Dass offered me money.

1134
01:27:50,600 --> 01:27:53,500
Had I known that you were my dad
I would have killed you for free of cost.

1135
01:27:54,300 --> 01:27:55,900
Go away.

1136
01:28:03,700 --> 01:28:06,600
As far as I remember PR
doesn't have a wife...

1137
01:28:06,700 --> 01:28:08,700
...then how is Kranthi his son?

1138
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:13,100
Else that PR is doing a drama to kill me.

1139
01:28:13,500 --> 01:28:16,700
Will he kill me because I asked
him to kill his dad?

1140
01:28:17,300 --> 01:28:19,900
I couldn't understand
what will happen next

1141
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,900
Pardon, we couldn't get you.
My neck pains listening to you.

1142
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:24,500
Because of tutelary norms at northwest...

1143
01:28:25,100 --> 01:28:27,500
Tutelary norms at northwest?

1144
01:28:27,600 --> 01:28:30,700
When weight is at northwest,
will he become PR's son?

1145
01:28:31,800 --> 01:28:34,100
When it is at northeast,
will you become my son?

1146
01:28:42,300 --> 01:28:43,100
Come dear.

1147
01:28:43,700 --> 01:28:46,200
I heard that your mom died.
I feel sorry.

1148
01:28:46,900 --> 01:28:48,400
My mom died 1 <i>7 years ago.

1149
01:28:51,900 --> 01:28:55,500
Dass, you would have
known everything by now.

1150
01:28:56,700 --> 01:28:59,700
I won't kill my dad
even if you offer me more money.

1151
01:29:00,500 --> 01:29:01,800
That's why I've brought your money back.

1152
01:29:02,700 --> 01:29:05,300
I am not as cruel as you think.

1153
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:09,900
From starting stage itself
he was spoiling me and my business.

1154
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:12,500
First time I thought
I got one man to kill him.

1155
01:29:12,700 --> 01:29:14,400
But you happen to be his son.

1156
01:29:14,500 --> 01:29:17,800
What can I do?

1157
01:29:21,100 --> 01:29:23,600
He got you after 20 years, isn't it?

1158
01:29:23,800 --> 01:29:26,700
If I kill you,
it's like avenging him

1159
01:29:26,800 --> 01:29:27,800
- How is it?
- Yes brother.

1160
01:29:29,400 --> 01:29:31,900
Excellent Dass!

1161
01:29:32,600 --> 01:29:34,700
What a brain?

1162
01:29:35,200 --> 01:29:40,700
I returned your advance only,
but I still have your gun and bullets.

1163
01:29:43,600 --> 01:29:47,400
Shall I use it?

1164
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:50,200
Don't you know how I use it?

1165
01:29:51,200 --> 01:29:52,600
I justjoked.

1166
01:29:53,500 --> 01:29:54,800
Don't do it henceforth.

1167
01:29:55,200 --> 01:29:56,500
Look at his speed.

1168
01:29:56,900 --> 01:29:58,300
Whose blood is this?
PR's blood.

1169
01:29:59,900 --> 01:30:01,000
Now what will you do?

1170
01:30:01,300 --> 01:30:02,600
Will you go to your dad?

1171
01:30:02,700 --> 01:30:03,700
Or will you stay with me?

1172
01:30:03,800 --> 01:30:06,600
I am not going anywhere.
I will do my work.

1173
01:30:08,400 --> 01:30:10,900
It's better to do yourjob.

1174
01:30:16,100 --> 01:30:18,400
Congrats to PR's son.

1175
01:30:20,700 --> 01:30:21,800
That is my bad luck.

1176
01:30:22,100 --> 01:30:24,000
But I feel lucky to have your call.

1177
01:30:25,500 --> 01:30:27,700
Day before yesterday
I wanted to tell this...

1178
01:30:27,800 --> 01:30:29,400
What? Will you tell it now?
Where should I come?

1179
01:30:30,700 --> 01:30:31,500
I am coming...

1180
01:30:32,100 --> 01:30:35,000
Greetings!
Welcome to public mind show...

1181
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:36,600
Technology has developed well.

1182
01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:38,000
We can plant the bomb in the place...

1183
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:39,100
...and can watch it live on TV.

1184
01:30:39,200 --> 01:30:40,400
Did you plant it correctly?

1185
01:30:41,400 --> 01:30:43,100
I planted the bomb in centre of the jeep.

1186
01:30:44,500 --> 01:30:47,600
The moment it fires Kranthi will die.

1187
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:54,000
What have you done?

1188
01:30:54,500 --> 01:30:55,700
- I jumped.
- Before that.

1189
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:56,800
I applied my jeep's brake.

1190
01:30:56,800 --> 01:30:58,000
What if anything had happen
to my vehicle...

1191
01:30:58,200 --> 01:30:59,000
Are you mad?

1192
01:30:59,800 --> 01:31:00,500
Nothing has happened.

1193
01:31:00,700 --> 01:31:02,300
If anything had happen...
- Nothing has happened.

1194
01:31:02,600 --> 01:31:04,100
My name is Thelupu (Neat) Ramkrishna

1195
01:31:04,600 --> 01:31:07,000
- Neatness is in my life
- Then clean my jeep.

1196
01:31:08,500 --> 01:31:11,100
I won't use if my vehicle
has a small crack.

1197
01:31:11,500 --> 01:31:14,100
You fool! Don't cross my way.

1198
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:15,800
My vehicle!

1199
01:31:26,400 --> 01:31:27,200
Tell me quickly

1200
01:31:27,400 --> 01:31:28,800
I thought I wanted to tell you that day.
But there was a fight.

1201
01:31:29,300 --> 01:31:32,300
After that I came to Premalayam
but there was a father problem.

1202
01:31:32,500 --> 01:31:33,300
No tension now.

Tell me quickly.

1204
01:31:38,600 --> 01:31:39,500

1208
01:31:46,500 --> 01:31:49,100

01:31:49,400 --> 01:31:52,900
Yes, I love you.

1210
01:31:54,200 --> 01:31:57,400

Oh god! She told me.

1212
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:02,300
Don't talk. Let me enjoy myself.

1213
01:32:03,800 --> 01:32:05,300
Is it confirmed?
- Yes confirmed.

1214
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:36,000
Where is my bike?

1215
01:32:37,200 --> 01:32:38,200
My bike...

1216
01:32:42,100 --> 01:32:42,900
Chain only remained.

1217
01:32:43,400 --> 01:32:44,800
Welcome to TV 5 news...

My new bike is gone.

1225
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:06,900
Who planted the bomb in the jeep?

1226
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:08,800
He didn't plant the bomb.
He only kept it.

1227
01:34:09,200 --> 01:34:10,300
- I will kill you.
- He is escaping...

1228
01:34:20,200 --> 01:34:21,200
Who? How do I tell about him?

If you come front
I'll kill her. - Kill her.

1230
01:34:48,500 --> 01:34:49,300
Is she my relative?

1231

What you?

1232
01:34:54,300 --> 01:34:55,100
Stop.

1233
01:34:56,600 --> 01:34:58,200
- He... - Come, let's go.
- Catch him.

1234
01:34:59,100 --> 01:35:02,600
Stop, leave him, you...

- Showing knife in public
- Take him.

1236
01:35:05,800 --> 01:35:07,300
Oh God! I saved your dignity and life.

1237
01:35:07,800 --> 01:35:09,300
Get in.

- Seems he is good man.
- Good man?

1239
01:35:11,600 --> 01:35:13,300
He is the reason of
bomb blast in this city.

He will rape pretty girls in the night
whom he likes at day time.

1241
01:35:17,100 --> 01:35:20,200
- Careful -Where are they
taking him? - To jail.

1242
01:35:20,300 --> 01:35:21,200
He won't come again.

1243
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:23,000
My bike also won't come.

1244
01:35:23,300 --> 01:35:24,100
You go.

1245
01:35:26,300 --> 01:35:27,800
What is his back ground?

1246
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:29,700
He appeared with Acid Durga for 6 months.

1247
01:35:30,100 --> 01:35:31,700
He quarreled there
and recently he joined Dass.

1248
01:35:32,900 --> 01:35:33,800

1250
01:35:37,300 --> 01:35:38,100

What is your father's name?

1252
01:35:42,400 --> 01:35:43,300
Why are you silent?

1253
01:35:44,300 --> 01:35:45,100
What is your father's name?

1254
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:50,800
Father name is PR

1255
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:53,200
Is it enough or do you want address?

1256
01:35:53,300 --> 01:35:55,100
Sir, is he your son?

1257
01:35:55,400 --> 01:35:56,700
That was his jeep.

1258
01:35:57,100 --> 01:35:59,000
He is running the jeep with
the Gas cylinder. It exploded.

1259
01:35:59,100 --> 01:36:00,300
Lawyer, take care of the formalities.

1260
01:36:04,400 --> 01:36:05,400
Sir, you may go.

1261
01:36:09,900 --> 01:36:11,100
Father, shall we go?

1262
01:36:13,300 --> 01:36:16,200
Only orphans should stay in Premalayam...

1263
01:36:16,900 --> 01:36:18,000
No place for you as you've your father.

1264
01:36:19,200 --> 01:36:21,300
You have a problem with Dass.

1265
01:36:22,700 --> 01:36:26,300
He has more affection for you.
That's why he came here.

1266
01:36:26,500 --> 01:36:28,100
If you don't go with him than I swear...

1267
01:36:42,400 --> 01:36:43,200
Come.

1268
01:36:43,400 --> 01:36:44,200
Come dear.

1269
01:36:53,300 --> 01:36:54,200
Priya and her mom have come.

1270
01:36:54,700 --> 01:36:56,200
Dear! Priya is Seshu's daughter.

1271
01:36:56,300 --> 01:36:57,300
She has come from America.

1272
01:36:57,400 --> 01:36:58,200
Come.

1273
01:37:03,300 --> 01:37:04,100

Show my home to son.

1275
01:37:08,900 --> 01:37:10,100
Take care of him.

1276
01:37:12,100 --> 01:37:13,800
I had a doubt when you
asked for chair in Hong Kong.

1277
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:14,900
Hadn't you ask about that?

1278
01:37:15,200 --> 01:37:16,700
This home is yours
and chair too.

1279
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,100
You have become a heir
to the place you worked.

1280
01:37:19,200 --> 01:37:20,200
Are you happy?

1281
01:37:20,400 --> 01:37:22,400
Shut up. Tell me where is my room?

1282
01:37:22,500 --> 01:37:23,300
At upstairs.

1283
01:37:23,500 --> 01:37:25,800
Don't call me dear.
- Ok dear.

1284
01:37:46,200 --> 01:37:48,500
He will rape pretty girls in the night
whom he likes at day time.

1285
01:37:51,800 --> 01:37:52,600
Oh God!

1286
01:37:55,800 --> 01:37:56,800
Will you rape me?

1287
01:37:59,100 --> 01:38:00,000
Have you decided?

1288
01:38:00,900 --> 01:38:03,700
Are you Priya?
- Like your mom?

1289
01:38:04,200 --> 01:38:07,200
Will you ask for name
and address and then you rape?

1290
01:38:15,200 --> 01:38:18,000
- He is Kranthi.
PR's son. - Is it?

1291
01:38:18,100 --> 01:38:20,300
Priya was attacked
when we came from Airport.

1292
01:38:20,400 --> 01:38:21,500
He saved her.

1293
01:38:22,500 --> 01:38:23,400
Is your introduction over?

1294
01:38:25,300 --> 01:38:26,900
Priya, my daughter.

1295
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:29,200
She is fair like her mom
and hasty like you.

1296
01:38:32,100 --> 01:38:33,900
Ok, I like this room.

1297
01:38:34,100 --> 01:38:35,300
You shift her to some other room.

1298
01:38:49,800 --> 01:38:52,600
He has grown up like a labourer.

1299
01:38:59,500 --> 01:39:00,800
I will change him stylishly.

1300
01:39:41,500 --> 01:39:45,700
<i>Oh sorceress! Don't do magic at me.</i>

1301
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:54,400
<i>I am coming at you,</i>
<i>What can I do darling?</i>

1302
01:39:58,700 --> 01:40:02,800
<i>Come! I'll show you stars.</i>

1303
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:07,200
<i>I'll make thunders for you.</i>

1304
01:40:07,400 --> 01:40:11,500
<i>I'll make you tickle like this.</i>

1305
01:40:11,600 --> 01:40:16,100
<i>And I'll make you sweat.</i>

1306
01:40:29,500 --> 01:40:31,400
<i>You are a ripe mango.</i>

1307
01:41:10,500 --> 01:41:14,500
<i>I'll crush you with my hug.</i>

1308
01:41:14,800 --> 01:41:18,800
<i>I'll compress you with my kisses.</i>

1309
01:41:19,200 --> 01:41:23,400
<i>I can tempt you with my call.</i>

1310
01:41:23,500 --> 01:41:27,300
<i>I'll become heat for your cooling</i>

1311
01:41:27,400 --> 01:41:29,400
<i>You're in a Dilemma...</i>

1312
01:41:29,500 --> 01:41:33,700
<i>... you tried and changed my style.</i>

1313
01:41:33,900 --> 01:41:35,900
<i>Your trailer is so hot...</i>

1314
01:41:36,100 --> 01:41:40,900
<i>... if you co-operate,</i>
<i>we shall make merry.</i>

1315
01:42:33,100 --> 01:42:37,200
<i>First I'll give you</i>
<i>honey with my lips.</i>

1316
01:42:37,400 --> 01:42:41,300
<i>Next I'll give you</i>
<i>my beauty to enjoy.</i>

1317
01:42:41,800 --> 01:42:45,800
<i>Then you have to taste</i>
<i>my beauty curves.</i>

1318
01:42:46,100 --> 01:42:49,900
<i>Shenoy (pipe instrument) sound should</i>
<i>be heard in our romance.</i>

1319
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,000
<i>Oh mynah! You liked this dynamite.</i>

1320
01:42:52,100 --> 01:42:56,200
<i>You aroused me</i>
<i>with your fatal glances.</i>

1321
01:42:56,500 --> 01:42:58,500
<i>I came without seeing the poster...</i>

1322
01:42:58,600 --> 01:43:01,000
<i>I can't wait for the show to begin.</i>

1323
01:43:01,100 --> 01:43:03,600
<i>So get ready for our love war.</i>

1324
01:43:14,300 --> 01:43:15,200
Welcome to creative dynamic
young dashing director Brahmmi.

1325
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:18,500
What's this autograph and photograph?

1326
01:43:19,400 --> 01:43:21,100
I don't understand
by seeing this fan following.

1327
01:43:25,600 --> 01:43:26,800
- Sir I saw your cinema.
- Is it nice?

1328
01:43:26,900 --> 01:43:28,300
Very nice sir.
- Yes it is.

1329
01:43:28,600 --> 01:43:30,000
Who called me?

1330
01:43:40,200 --> 01:43:41,800
Boss, tonsured boss.

1331
01:43:42,200 --> 01:43:43,200
Where is Rajini hasan?

1332
01:43:44,500 --> 01:43:46,600
It's me. I changed my costume
Can't you recognize me?

1333
01:43:54,400 --> 01:43:56,800
Have I come to see your
talent or your student's talent?

1334
01:43:56,900 --> 01:43:57,700
Come sir.

1335
01:44:00,400 --> 01:44:02,100
Sir, I saw your cinema.
But I couldn't understand first half.

1336
01:44:02,200 --> 01:44:04,100
- You won't understand second half too.
See the next movie. - Why sir?

1337
01:44:05,600 --> 01:44:06,400
Sit down.

1338
01:44:13,800 --> 01:44:14,700
Don't give that sound.

1339
01:44:18,900 --> 01:44:19,700
Get up.

1340
01:44:20,500 --> 01:44:21,300
Why is he like this?

1341
01:44:22,400 --> 01:44:23,200
He is the hero of my new skit.

1342
01:44:24,100 --> 01:44:26,200
Do you know about the skit's name?
Spider Reddy.

1343
01:44:28,500 --> 01:44:30,100
I have mixed fantasy in faction.

1344
01:44:30,400 --> 01:44:31,600
In flash back he is a factionist.

1345
01:44:31,800 --> 01:44:33,500
I made him as Spider Reddy.

1346
01:44:34,800 --> 01:44:36,600
At least let us spare
those movies for children.

1347
01:44:36,700 --> 01:44:37,600
You go and show your talent.

1348
01:44:51,900 --> 01:44:53,700
I am saying patting my thigh...

1349
01:44:54,500 --> 01:44:55,800
I swear of Spider.

1350
01:44:59,700 --> 01:45:01,200
...I will kill you.

1351
01:45:06,100 --> 01:45:07,900
If you want you can use that story.

1352
01:45:21,100 --> 01:45:23,600
Oh God! Will he make her as heroine?

1353
01:45:31,700 --> 01:45:32,700
She has done a make-up and is dancing.

1354
01:45:33,200 --> 01:45:35,400
You can choose another
for a heroine. Varalakshmi.

1355
01:45:35,700 --> 01:45:36,800
You have to make her a heroine somehow.

1356
01:45:41,200 --> 01:45:44,200
Oh God! She is waving as if its
a 100 days movie function heroine.

1357
01:45:44,500 --> 01:45:46,300
- It's her confidence.
- I have no confidence in you.

1358
01:45:46,500 --> 01:45:48,800
I will give a small variation.
You'll get it again.

1359
01:45:51,200 --> 01:45:55,800
In world history
this Rajini Hasan's creation is...

1360
01:45:55,900 --> 01:45:57,400
Hunting in dark.

1361
01:45:58,700 --> 01:46:01,200
This skit is dedicated to Mr. Brahmmi
- For me?

1362
01:46:05,800 --> 01:46:07,300
After 5 minutes.

1363
01:46:09,100 --> 01:46:10,100
How is it sir?

1364
01:46:12,800 --> 01:46:16,700
How do I tell my opinion when
I couldn't see anything in this dark?

1365
01:46:16,800 --> 01:46:18,500
I tried something new.

1366
01:46:18,600 --> 01:46:21,100
- I wanted to achieve your position.
- Come and sit here.

1367
01:46:21,600 --> 01:46:23,600
- Go man.
- Stop.

1368
01:46:38,400 --> 01:46:39,900
See, how big home it is!

1369
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:40,900
Why did you come here?

1370
01:46:41,800 --> 01:46:42,600
Where is Kranthi?

1371
01:46:43,100 --> 01:46:44,400
He is sleeping inside.
What work you have here?

1372
01:46:44,500 --> 01:46:46,800
Henceforth this is our home.
Come on guys.

1373
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:55,000
Oh God!

1374
01:46:56,800 --> 01:46:57,800
You! Why are you here?

1375
01:46:58,500 --> 01:46:59,800
I am observing you.

1376
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:01,900
Your dad has asked me
to change your style.

1377
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,800
You're to do hair grooming and a facial.

1378
01:47:05,300 --> 01:47:07,000
You've to change your dress style.

1379
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:10,000
Fitness is very important.

1380
01:47:10,200 --> 01:47:12,400
Fitness? I don't want.

1381
01:47:12,900 --> 01:47:13,900
I had to need this before

1382
01:47:14,300 --> 01:47:16,000
But now everyone want me
to become slim.

1383
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:17,700
I beg you, please leave me.
Let me sleep.

1384
01:47:17,900 --> 01:47:19,000
Fitness is important for us.

1385
01:47:19,500 --> 01:47:20,900
That is correct.
He said it right.

1386
01:47:21,300 --> 01:47:23,500
Have you all come?
- Yes.

1387
01:47:23,700 --> 01:47:24,900
Enjoy yourself.
This house is ours.

1388
01:47:25,100 --> 01:47:26,100
Why did you see like this?

1389
01:47:26,400 --> 01:47:27,300
No brother.

1390
01:47:27,700 --> 01:47:29,600
Varalakshmi sister in law is waiting
there for you.

1391
01:47:29,800 --> 01:47:32,700
- Today is valentines day.
- Oh God! Why're you saying it so late?

1392
01:47:34,100 --> 01:47:37,100
I have to say this matter
to elder sister in law.

1393
01:47:40,100 --> 01:47:41,000
Where is your boy friend?

1394
01:47:41,600 --> 01:47:42,400
He will come.

1395
01:47:45,700 --> 01:47:48,300
One vehicle sunlight and
one vehicle moonlight

1396
01:47:48,600 --> 01:47:52,100
If you mix this
that is my color.

1397
01:47:52,400 --> 01:47:54,300
At least will my lover
accept my love today?

1398
01:47:54,600 --> 01:47:56,300
No doubt. Definitely she won't accept it.

1399
01:47:56,600 --> 01:47:57,400
Why won't she accept my love?

1400
01:47:57,800 --> 01:48:00,800
You look like a thief.

1401
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:04,000
In valentines day, you should have
chocolates and gift to give her...

1402
01:48:04,100 --> 01:48:07,300
...or you should be colorful.

1403
01:48:07,700 --> 01:48:09,600
Whether you are black,
white or blue...

1404
01:48:09,700 --> 01:48:10,900
...you should have everything in excess.

1405
01:48:11,400 --> 01:48:13,400
You should definitely have flowers

1406
01:48:13,600 --> 01:48:15,400
No romance without flowers

1407
01:48:16,100 --> 01:48:17,400
Come here.

1408
01:48:21,600 --> 01:48:22,900
Being fair is not enough.

1409
01:48:23,100 --> 01:48:24,100
You should be smart.

1410
01:48:24,200 --> 01:48:25,700
Girls sometimes don't like
even smart men like me

1411
01:48:25,900 --> 01:48:27,400
Forget her if you can't manage

1412
01:48:31,200 --> 01:48:33,000
- Happy Violence day!
- Violence?

1413
01:48:33,200 --> 01:48:34,700
I am little weak in English!

1414
01:48:35,300 --> 01:48:37,100
Happy Valentines' day!

1415
01:48:42,200 --> 01:48:44,800
What? It seems there is
a girl named Priya at home

1416
01:48:45,900 --> 01:48:46,700
Rambo told me.

1417
01:48:47,700 --> 01:48:48,700
Competition?

1418
01:48:49,400 --> 01:48:50,500
No competition for you

1419
01:48:52,900 --> 01:48:53,800
Those flowers are mine.

1420
01:48:54,600 --> 01:48:55,800
Look! Nature is ours.

1421
01:48:56,300 --> 01:49:00,600
Don't say that flowers, stems,
trees and leaves are yours.

1422
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:02,200
It sounds horrible.
Leave it.

1423
01:49:02,800 --> 01:49:03,900
I bought these.

1424
01:49:04,400 --> 01:49:05,600
Then go and search there.
What work do you have here?

1425
01:49:05,800 --> 01:49:08,900
My name is on the flowers.
I wrote it. Move.

1426
01:49:09,500 --> 01:49:12,000
- This...
- Is it this?

1427
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:14,200
How is it coming from my back?

1428
01:49:14,500 --> 01:49:16,600
Something happens
whenever I meet you.

1429
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:19,900
Once there was a fight.

1430
01:49:21,800 --> 01:49:22,600
Later it was an explosion.

1431
01:49:24,200 --> 01:49:25,100
I feel tense.

1432
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:26,800
You don't worry.

1433
01:49:27,100 --> 01:49:27,900
No tension henceforth.

1434
01:49:30,200 --> 01:49:31,200
Oh God!

1435
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:39,800
I should have told you
when I was in bed with you.

1436
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:41,800
But I didn't have flowers then

1437
01:49:42,200 --> 01:49:43,200
Then you were missing.

1438
01:49:44,200 --> 01:49:45,300
She is Varalakshmi...

1439
01:49:50,400 --> 01:49:51,900
In bed...
Have you seen it?

1440
01:49:52,300 --> 01:49:53,500
He took my flowers.

1441
01:49:53,600 --> 01:49:54,900
And she took your flowers.

1442
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:56,100
That's why we have to see between us.

1443
01:49:56,300 --> 01:49:57,400
If outsiders enter,
situation will be like that.

1444
01:49:57,600 --> 01:49:59,700
If he is a cowboy,
I am a lover boy.

1445
01:50:04,800 --> 01:50:05,600
Oh God!

1446
01:50:07,600 --> 01:50:10,000
- Am I that boring?
- Not you. You continue...

1447
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:12,000
He said that you are boring.

1448
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:14,000
These flowers are mine.

1449
01:50:15,200 --> 01:50:16,000
Get lost!

1450
01:50:31,100 --> 01:50:31,900
What are you doing?

1451
01:50:32,900 --> 01:50:34,500
Thank God you didn't squat
in the bed room. Useless guy.

1452
01:50:37,800 --> 01:50:39,100
Where do they come from?

1453
01:50:42,300 --> 01:50:43,800
Eat well.

1454
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:47,900
Brother, they eat always.

1455
01:50:48,200 --> 01:50:49,500
Bring the ice cream.

1456
01:50:49,600 --> 01:50:51,300
Me? I will bring that.

1457
01:50:51,400 --> 01:50:53,000
Brother, you won't get food here.

1458
01:50:53,100 --> 01:50:55,300
- I'll bring it from the hotel
- You eat this. You go.

1459
01:50:55,600 --> 01:50:56,700
Eat.

1460
01:51:01,200 --> 01:51:03,800
This PR has no
weakness or sentiments.

1461
01:51:04,300 --> 01:51:07,000
Come and die.

1462
01:51:09,400 --> 01:51:10,500
Hey, what is this?

1463
01:51:11,700 --> 01:51:12,800
We are playing like PR

1464
01:51:12,900 --> 01:51:15,900
PR play? It seems you are
playing with PR.

1465
01:51:16,100 --> 01:51:16,900
Ok, do it.

1466
01:51:45,100 --> 01:51:47,100
What brother? You look happy
and are singing a song.

1467
01:51:47,200 --> 01:51:50,100
Tomorrow if I have to beg,
I should know these songs.

1468
01:51:50,200 --> 01:51:51,800
What happened brother in law?

1469
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:53,700
That PR family was like a don's father...

1470
01:51:53,800 --> 01:51:56,200
...now it has become a close knit family.

1471
01:51:56,300 --> 01:52:00,900
Son, his fiancee and
that children, all are happy in that home.

1472
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:02,200
I understand your problem.

1473
01:52:03,100 --> 01:52:06,800
This time I will plan an
assault for both PR and Kranthi.

1474
01:52:06,900 --> 01:52:08,600
I beg you.

1475
01:52:08,800 --> 01:52:10,200
Don't render such comical dialogues.

1476
01:52:10,700 --> 01:52:13,200
- Let change tutelary norms of our home
- I don't believe in that.

1477
01:52:13,300 --> 01:52:14,700
I believe myself.

1478
01:52:15,500 --> 01:52:16,800
This time I will shoot them.

1479
01:52:17,300 --> 01:52:19,900
If I shoot them...

1480
01:52:20,400 --> 01:52:23,500
Both of them will die...

1481
01:52:26,100 --> 01:52:27,500
Banerji, you go to Hong kong

1482
01:52:27,600 --> 01:52:28,900
It'll take 10 days for me to come there

1483
01:52:29,300 --> 01:52:30,900
You take care of that Hawala matter also.

1484
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,600
Brother, my second marriage is fixed.

1485
01:52:34,600 --> 01:52:35,500
Day after tomorrow is my marriage.

1486
01:52:35,800 --> 01:52:36,800
You must come.

1487
01:52:36,800 --> 01:52:38,200
Why do you again do the same mistake?

1488
01:52:38,300 --> 01:52:40,200
His first wife eloped in his
first night. - I won't invite you.

1489
01:52:46,300 --> 01:52:47,800
I missed it.

1490
01:52:48,200 --> 01:52:49,900
- Hey! - Brother.
- Not like that.

1491
01:52:50,100 --> 01:52:51,900
Hang a bottle and practice shooting.

1492
01:52:52,100 --> 01:52:54,200
Or you practice shooting by keeping
a watermelon over acid's head.

1493
01:52:54,300 --> 01:52:55,700
Why watermelon?
Let's shoot acid.

1494
01:52:55,800 --> 01:52:56,900
Acid, come here.

1495
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:59,100
If he had shot me correctly, my death
would've happened but not my marriage...

1496
01:52:59,300 --> 01:53:01,500
- Whatever it is, we'll get food
- What is it PR?

1497
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:03,900
Will you kill him?

1498
01:53:04,800 --> 01:53:05,700
Why did you take the gun?

1499
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,100
If there were toys at home,
they would've played with them.

1500
01:53:08,300 --> 01:53:10,800
Since only guns were there
they're playing with it.

1501
01:53:10,900 --> 01:53:11,900
Did I allow them to stay here?

1502
01:53:12,700 --> 01:53:14,100
Go, go from my home.

1503
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:16,900
If it is my home,
it is their home too.

1504
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:18,300
- They won't go.
- Yes

1505
01:53:18,400 --> 01:53:20,100
See, I have no relations like this.

1506
01:53:20,600 --> 01:53:22,100
I will give 1crore.
Drive them away.

1507
01:53:22,300 --> 01:53:25,000
You don't have relations
and I don't have rules.

1508
01:53:25,200 --> 01:53:26,800
I don't prefer money like you.

1509
01:53:27,100 --> 01:53:29,900
Dass offered me 1crore
advance to kill you.

1510
01:53:30,500 --> 01:53:31,600
Hey, is that topic important now?

1511
01:53:31,800 --> 01:53:33,000
Give it.
Is that topic important now?

1512
01:53:33,100 --> 01:53:34,100
PR dear!

1513
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:37,000
Patience is more important than anger.

1514
01:53:37,900 --> 01:53:39,100
What God said is...

1515
01:53:39,100 --> 01:53:41,000
Has God told everything only for me?
Nothing for him?

1516
01:53:41,100 --> 01:53:42,400
Brother, don't get emotional

1517
01:53:42,700 --> 01:53:45,400
He is our dear.
Day after tomorrow is my marriage.

1518
01:53:45,500 --> 01:53:46,800
- You must come.
- I won't come.

1519
01:53:47,400 --> 01:53:48,200
My dad also won't come.

1520
01:53:48,400 --> 01:53:50,700
Who are you to say that?
We will go.

1521
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:53,400
Dass is waiting for you to kill.

1522
01:53:53,600 --> 01:53:54,900
Go, but you won't come back.

1523
01:53:55,100 --> 01:53:55,900
He will kill you.

1524
01:53:56,200 --> 01:53:58,000
This spot is new for you
but not for us.

1525
01:53:58,400 --> 01:54:00,400
Hey Acid, we will come.

1526
01:54:00,800 --> 01:54:02,300
Make the arrangements
Come.

1527
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:21,900
PR brother has come.

1528
01:54:24,700 --> 01:54:26,000
We have reached.
You may go.

1529
01:54:27,600 --> 01:54:29,900
Greetings brother, come.

1530
01:54:30,300 --> 01:54:31,200
Move.

1531
01:54:32,500 --> 01:54:34,200
- Brother, he is my dad and
she is my mom. - Greetings!

1532
01:54:34,800 --> 01:54:35,800
She is my wife.

1533
01:54:36,200 --> 01:54:37,000
You go and sit there.

1534
01:54:37,300 --> 01:54:38,600
At least you take care of
this girl so that she doesn't elope.

1535
01:54:39,200 --> 01:54:40,000
You sit down.

1536
01:54:41,100 --> 01:54:44,200
Brother, we mingled with marriage crowd.

1537
01:54:44,800 --> 01:54:45,700
Only PR has come.

1538
01:54:46,300 --> 01:54:47,100
But his son has not come.

1539
01:54:48,200 --> 01:54:50,100
First you kill that PR

1540
01:54:50,700 --> 01:54:54,000
In that place death cries only
should be heard and not nuptials

1541
01:54:58,800 --> 01:54:59,600
Oh God!

1542
01:56:12,600 --> 01:56:15,000
Dad!

1543
01:56:16,700 --> 01:56:18,100
Dad!

1544
01:56:25,400 --> 01:56:30,100
Tell Dass if he wants to kill PR
he should kill his son first

1545
01:56:55,800 --> 01:56:56,700
What happened Kranthi?

1546
01:56:58,000 --> 01:56:59,000
I told you not to go there.

1547
01:57:04,600 --> 01:57:05,400
How is brother?

1548
01:57:05,700 --> 01:57:06,600
He is fine.

1549
01:57:06,800 --> 01:57:08,600
He will be fine.
But my second wife...

1550
01:57:08,800 --> 01:57:11,400
Correct, at least first wife had clarity
that she eloped with phenol guy.

1551
01:57:11,500 --> 01:57:13,000
But second wife, you don't know
with whom she eloped.

1552
01:57:13,200 --> 01:57:15,300
Who told you?
I know. She eloped with the Driver.

1553
01:57:18,600 --> 01:57:19,900
Today is her birthday.

1554
01:57:23,500 --> 01:57:26,000
Today is not only your birthday
Mine also.

1555
01:57:27,700 --> 01:57:28,800
It would've been my death day.

1556
01:57:30,200 --> 01:57:31,100
He saved me.

1557
01:57:36,400 --> 01:57:39,700
He did what my Empire,
money and my security didn't do

1558
01:57:40,400 --> 01:57:41,900
He kept his life at stake and saved me.

1559
01:57:42,800 --> 01:57:44,200
I like him.

1560
01:57:44,400 --> 01:57:45,300
He is my heir.

1561
01:57:46,300 --> 01:57:47,900
Not only for my property
but for my guts too

1562
01:57:50,700 --> 01:57:53,900
- Brother! He is a gun but not a son.
- That's it.

1563
01:57:54,500 --> 01:57:55,700
Seshu, he is tiger.

1564
01:57:59,500 --> 01:58:01,700
Uncle, I want birthday gift.

1565
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:02,800
What do you want?

1566
01:58:38,400 --> 01:58:42,100
<i>Oh God! Fun has started.</i>

1567
01:58:42,200 --> 01:58:46,700
<i>Come, let's celebrate it.</i>

1568
01:58:57,500 --> 01:59:01,100
<i>Let's play Bangra music in Andhra.</i>

1569
01:59:01,200 --> 01:59:04,800
<i>It provoked my heart to dance.</i>

1570
01:59:04,900 --> 01:59:06,600
<i>Strange sounds are heard in my heart</i>

1571
01:59:06,700 --> 01:59:08,500
<i>This day tells you...</i>

1572
01:59:08,600 --> 01:59:11,500
<i>Full festival is here today.</i>

1573
01:59:11,600 --> 01:59:15,300
<i>Play the drums</i>
<i>Come, Come Kranthi.</i>

1574
01:59:15,400 --> 01:59:19,000
<i>Make merry!</i>
<i>Today is Sankranthi(Festival)</i>

1575
01:59:19,100 --> 01:59:22,800
<i>Play the drums!</i>
<i>No limit for joy!</i>

1576
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:26,600
<i>Make merry!</i>
<i>Happiness is our wealth!</i>

1577
02:00:00,700 --> 02:00:04,400
<i>Anyone will get hurt at tiger's paw.</i>

1578
02:00:04,500 --> 02:00:07,900
<i>Hold your strength,</i>
<i>you can fight with God of death.</i>

1579
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:11,900
<i>If you stare at me like that,</i>
<i>I remember my youth.</i>

1580
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:15,600
<i>Even if you glance at me,</i>
<i>I like that sight.</i>

1581
02:00:15,700 --> 02:00:19,200
<i>Our arrow is single one.</i>

1582
02:00:19,400 --> 02:00:23,000
<i>It'll hit the bull's eye.</i>

1583
02:00:23,200 --> 02:00:26,800
<i>My hero! I've fallen in love.</i>

1584
02:00:26,900 --> 02:00:30,800
<i>I gave you my heart.</i>

1585
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:34,400
<i>My speed won't stop.</i>

1586
02:00:34,500 --> 02:00:38,400
<i>If you spread your beauty,</i>
<i>you can't bear my speed.</i>

1587
02:01:38,700 --> 02:01:42,600
<i>My way is admired by everyone.</i>

1588
02:01:42,700 --> 02:01:46,200
<i>I'll be my own.</i>
<i>I am not scared of anything.</i>

1589
02:01:46,300 --> 02:01:50,100
<i>My body got thrilled because of you.</i>

1590
02:01:50,300 --> 02:01:53,800
<i>I didn't like anyone except you.</i>

1591
02:01:53,900 --> 02:01:57,200
<i>Our love game starts hunting</i>

1592
02:01:57,600 --> 02:02:01,100
<i>Anyhow I'll win in that.</i>

1593
02:02:01,300 --> 02:02:04,900
<i>Your coolness incites me...</i>

1594
02:02:05,100 --> 02:02:09,000
<i>... I want to extinguish it.</i>

1595
02:02:09,200 --> 02:02:12,600
<i>I'll brighten you and</i>
<i>make you forget day or night.</i>

1596
02:02:12,800 --> 02:02:16,600
<i>I'll become a guard for your dreams.</i>

1597
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:34,800
What are you?

1598
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:36,200
Working as a Manager
in a chit fund company

1599
02:02:37,300 --> 02:02:39,400
Salary?
- Approximately 10,000

1600
02:02:39,500 --> 02:02:42,500
- He got his house on a lottery
- Yes sir.

1601
02:02:42,800 --> 02:02:43,700
My daughter is lucky

1602
02:02:43,800 --> 02:02:46,700
You will get house, furniture and
foreign trip on lottery. Not son-in-law.

1603
02:02:49,200 --> 02:02:51,200
My range is what I want I will get.

1604
02:02:52,300 --> 02:02:55,000
But you life depends on discounts.

1605
02:02:56,200 --> 02:02:58,500
PR's daughter-in-law is my daughter.

1606
02:03:00,200 --> 02:03:03,000
Kranthi is close to my family even
before we know that he is your son.

1607
02:03:03,900 --> 02:03:05,600
He wanted to marry my daughter.

1608
02:03:05,700 --> 02:03:08,900
She said she loves him.

1609
02:03:09,100 --> 02:03:10,300
Earlier Kranthi was an orphan.

1610
02:03:11,300 --> 02:03:12,500
Now, you know whose son he is.

1611
02:03:13,500 --> 02:03:14,300
Ask her to look out for someone else.

1612
02:03:14,900 --> 02:03:16,900
Else, you can select.
She will trap him.

1613
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:18,000
Don't talk like that.

1614
02:03:18,500 --> 02:03:19,800
We are not like that.

1615
02:03:19,900 --> 02:03:22,800
Are you teaching me how to speak and
how to conduct my son's marriage?

1616
02:03:22,900 --> 02:03:25,900
You're not worthy enough
for me to warn you.

1617
02:03:26,200 --> 02:03:27,500
Brother!

1618
02:03:28,300 --> 02:03:29,100
Go man.

1619
02:03:33,400 --> 02:03:35,000
Hey, start the car

1620
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:43,900
Last week we didn't take a scan.
It has become a problem now

1621
02:03:44,700 --> 02:03:46,400
Kranthi, PR's son.

1622
02:03:47,700 --> 02:03:49,300
What happened?
He got only a small hit.

1623
02:03:50,800 --> 02:03:52,600
Nerves which supply blood
to the brain have got affected

1624
02:03:52,700 --> 02:03:53,800
It would result in a blood clot.

1625
02:03:54,300 --> 02:03:55,400
At that time he would faint.

1626
02:03:57,400 --> 02:03:58,500
He shouldn't get excited.

1627
02:03:58,900 --> 02:04:01,300
- Does he drink and smoke?
- Yes, he does.

1628
02:04:01,500 --> 02:04:02,400
He should quit it at once.

1629
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:05,100
I will give the tablets if he faints.

1630
02:04:05,200 --> 02:04:06,300
Use those tablets
he will become alright.

1631
02:04:06,700 --> 02:04:07,900
He should always be relaxed.

1632
02:04:08,100 --> 02:04:10,200
Don't bring him to operating stage.
Be careful.

1633
02:04:13,700 --> 02:04:14,600
Dad!

1634
02:04:16,500 --> 02:04:17,700
He asked you not to get excited.

1635
02:04:19,300 --> 02:04:21,300
I will take care.
You take rest.

1636
02:04:28,200 --> 02:04:30,000
From today onwards
printing work is closed

1637
02:04:30,200 --> 02:04:31,800
Go from here, go

1638
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:33,700
Dear, Sesha won't be quiet.

1639
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:35,500
- Whose factory is this?
- Your dad's.

1640
02:04:35,700 --> 02:04:37,000
Who is Seshu in between us?

1641
02:04:37,900 --> 02:04:39,700
Shut up and do your work.
Now I am here.

1642
02:04:44,200 --> 02:04:46,300
I heard that your dad warned my father.

1643
02:04:47,500 --> 02:04:50,600
We are not so cheap to seek
a rich son in law like you.

1644
02:04:51,900 --> 02:04:53,100
Henceforth don't meet me.

1645
02:04:53,900 --> 02:04:54,800
Don't call me.

1646
02:05:02,400 --> 02:05:03,200
Don't get tense.

1647
02:05:03,800 --> 02:05:05,300
He is my son.
He'll listen to my words.

1648
02:05:05,800 --> 02:05:06,800
You leave that matter.

1649
02:05:06,900 --> 02:05:07,800
Then who is your daughter-in-law?

1650
02:05:07,900 --> 02:05:09,100
He will marry your daughter only.

1651
02:05:09,800 --> 02:05:12,100
Kranthi has closed our press
and has driven out our people.

1652
02:05:13,200 --> 02:05:14,000
What?

1653
02:05:16,400 --> 02:05:17,800
Kranthi, come here.

1654
02:05:19,300 --> 02:05:21,500
Why did you close the press?

1655
02:05:21,600 --> 02:05:23,000
We've earned enough.

1656
02:05:23,300 --> 02:05:25,100
Doctor asked you not to get tense.

1657
02:05:25,400 --> 02:05:27,700
Problem will come from that press.
That's why.

1658
02:05:29,100 --> 02:05:29,900
Dad!

1659
02:05:30,200 --> 02:05:32,900
If you use smoke
Doctor said you will die.

1660
02:05:33,800 --> 02:05:35,600
How many times I told you?
Take it.

1661
02:05:37,400 --> 02:05:39,000
I gave only one peg.

1662
02:05:39,100 --> 02:05:41,600
Else you give poison.
You know only that.

1663
02:05:41,800 --> 02:05:44,100
Don't talk like that.
He is your uncle.

1664
02:05:44,200 --> 02:05:45,100
Uncle?

1665
02:05:47,100 --> 02:05:50,300
That's why did you
warn Varalakshmi's father?

1666
02:05:50,500 --> 02:05:53,600
Priya likes you.
That's why we decided.

1667
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:56,800
You don't decide.

1668
02:05:57,900 --> 02:05:59,800
I am committed to Varalakshmi
before I met Priya

1669
02:06:00,600 --> 02:06:01,400
Who are you to decide?

1670
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:03,100
I promised him.

1671
02:06:03,600 --> 02:06:04,400
What about it?

1672
02:06:04,900 --> 02:06:06,700
Dad!

1673
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:08,700
Dad, don't get excited.

1674
02:06:08,900 --> 02:06:10,600
Take tablets.

1675
02:06:11,300 --> 02:06:12,300
Take him.

1676
02:06:13,100 --> 02:06:14,800
If you take that topic again...

1677
02:06:24,100 --> 02:06:25,400
Why don't you speak with him?

1678
02:06:26,200 --> 02:06:27,000
No.

1679
02:06:33,400 --> 02:06:34,900
I am Kranthi.
Please switch on the speaker.

1680
02:06:37,500 --> 02:06:39,200
Varalakshmi, I want to talk with you.

1681
02:06:39,900 --> 02:06:40,700
Please give me one chance.

1682
02:06:42,100 --> 02:06:43,100
I am in library.

1683
02:06:43,200 --> 02:06:45,000
When they start a library
in city bus?

1684
02:06:50,200 --> 02:06:52,200
You thought that I have changed a lot.

1685
02:06:52,900 --> 02:06:54,200
But I have only one change.

1686
02:06:54,500 --> 02:06:55,400
That is your love.

1687
02:06:56,500 --> 02:06:57,800
No one can separate it from me.

1688
02:06:58,300 --> 02:07:01,700
I wanted to bring you home
for the insult your father had.

1689
02:07:03,700 --> 02:07:04,600
Please understand.

1690
02:07:07,900 --> 02:07:10,600
- 225.
- I am also 225

1691
02:07:11,200 --> 02:07:12,200
Get down in the next stop.

1692
02:07:28,800 --> 02:07:30,500
Kranthi, they have taken Varalakshmi.

1693
02:07:54,700 --> 02:07:56,300
Are you her hero?

1694
02:07:56,700 --> 02:07:57,800
You forget her.

1695
02:07:58,200 --> 02:07:59,500
Else you will die.

1696
02:07:59,600 --> 02:08:01,400
Now even if you leave her
I won't leave you.

1697
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:03,000
I have decided.

1698
02:09:24,700 --> 02:09:25,900
Hey, have you finished?

1699
02:09:38,300 --> 02:09:39,100
What happened dear?

1700
02:09:39,400 --> 02:09:42,900
He has planned to kill Varalakshmi. She'll
be a problem for his daughter marriage.

1701
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:46,000
Why should he do like that?

1702
02:09:46,400 --> 02:09:47,200
You ask him.

1703
02:09:47,400 --> 02:09:48,300
Check the phone.

1704
02:09:48,800 --> 02:09:51,300
You'll know how eagerly he is waiting
for her death news.

1705
02:09:51,600 --> 02:09:53,400
If anyone comes to claim what I own...

1706
02:09:53,500 --> 02:09:55,000
...Whoever it is I will chop them.

1707
02:09:56,500 --> 02:09:57,200
Yes...

1708
02:09:58,800 --> 02:10:00,900
Dad!

1709
02:10:01,400 --> 02:10:02,200
Bring the tablet.

1710
02:10:04,100 --> 02:10:04,900
Take the tablet.

1711
02:10:05,900 --> 02:10:07,100
Dad, go inside.

1712
02:10:09,700 --> 02:10:12,800
You said you will arrange for
my marriage with Kranthi.

1713
02:10:13,400 --> 02:10:14,300
But, is it this way?

1714
02:10:15,900 --> 02:10:17,400
I feel ashamed
to be born as your daughter.

1715
02:10:18,300 --> 02:10:21,000
Mom! Tomorrow we are going to New York.

1716
02:10:25,200 --> 02:10:26,700
Please pardon my dad.

1717
02:10:28,400 --> 02:10:30,300
I have no feelings with you
ever since I met you

1718
02:10:33,900 --> 02:10:36,900
You've got a good man as your husband.

1719
02:10:41,600 --> 02:10:44,300
Thank God! There is no
competition henceforth

1720
02:10:44,800 --> 02:10:46,100
It has become a single heroine movie.

1721
02:11:10,700 --> 02:11:12,600
<i>Oh dear!</i>

1722
02:11:12,800 --> 02:11:15,000
<i>Come near my dear.</i>

1723
02:11:19,200 --> 02:11:23,600
<i>Look at me dear!</i>
<i>Oh mighty!</i>

1724
02:11:33,700 --> 02:11:37,700
<i>You beauty bomb!</i>
<i>Don't explode it in front of me.</i>

1725
02:11:37,900 --> 02:11:43,300
<i>Don't make me crazy.</i>
<i>You're mine.</i>

1726
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:51,700
<i>Let me become half in you.</i>

1727
02:11:55,400 --> 02:11:56,400
<i>Is it so?</i>

1728
02:11:57,300 --> 02:11:58,600
<i>So why?</i>

1729
02:11:59,300 --> 02:12:00,600
<i>Do it.</i>

1730
02:12:01,500 --> 02:12:02,800
<i>Go ahead.</i>

1731
02:12:48,500 --> 02:12:52,200
<i>Come dear Madava(God)</i>
<i>My dear Kesava(God)</i>

1732
02:12:52,300 --> 02:12:56,500
<i>Let me pamper you with my beauty.</i>

1733
02:13:01,300 --> 02:13:04,700
<i>Come soon and hug me.</i>

1734
02:13:04,900 --> 02:13:08,900
<i>Pull this beauty with your love.</i>

1735
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:14,100
<i>And make me love with affection.</i>

1736
02:14:12,400 --> 02:14:16,400
<i>Lovely beauty!</i>
<i>Colorful Hansika.</i>

1737
02:14:16,500 --> 02:14:20,400
<i>If I kiss you,</i>
<i>don't bother me.</i>

1738
02:14:20,900 --> 02:14:22,700
<i>You lusty guy.</i>

1739
02:14:22,900 --> 02:14:24,900
<i>Your penetrating looks are superb.</i>

1740
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:29,000
<i>Don't get crazy at my beauty.</i>

1741
02:14:29,200 --> 02:14:33,300
<i>Let me do love pooja,</i>
<i>till I get this beauty.</i>

1742
02:14:33,400 --> 02:14:38,100
<i>Don't try to hide it,</i>
<i>shoot me with your beauty.</i>

1743
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:45,400
- <i>Let's unite and...</i>
- <i>I touched you slowly...</i>

1744
02:15:01,500 --> 02:15:02,600
Madam and Priya have left.

1745
02:15:04,900 --> 02:15:06,100
What all did for your daughter.

1746
02:15:07,100 --> 02:15:09,200
Kranthi has made
your level come down.

1747
02:15:10,300 --> 02:15:11,600
PR also supports him.

1748
02:15:12,600 --> 02:15:13,700
After all this we shouldn't be here.

1749
02:15:14,800 --> 02:15:15,600
We shouldn't be here.

1750
02:15:16,300 --> 02:15:17,200
We will go out.

1751
02:15:17,900 --> 02:15:20,600
I have also decided
against father and son...

1752
02:15:22,400 --> 02:15:23,300
They made me lose my value

1753
02:15:25,600 --> 02:15:27,600
- I will ask for the share in property.
- Yes brother!

1754
02:15:45,100 --> 02:15:47,600
Dad is having a massage.
He can't meet anyone. Go away.

1755
02:15:53,200 --> 02:15:54,200
That kid told you, isn't it?

1756
02:15:54,800 --> 02:15:56,400
I want to talk to PR.

1757
02:15:56,900 --> 02:15:57,800
First you speak with me.

1758
02:15:59,100 --> 02:16:02,500
- I can talk about this only
with PR. - That was earlier.

1759
02:16:02,800 --> 02:16:04,500
Now I am here.

1760
02:16:04,800 --> 02:16:05,600
First you tell me.

1761
02:16:05,900 --> 02:16:08,600
I want my money.

1762
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:11,800
I want my share.

1763
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:14,300
I don't like your face or
you asking about the share.

1764
02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:16,500
I have dismissed you
Go.

1765
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:22,400
Do you think is this Governmentjob?

1766
02:16:22,500 --> 02:16:23,600
To get a final settlement.

1767
02:16:24,400 --> 02:16:27,500
Whatjob? We had earned together.

1768
02:16:27,700 --> 02:16:30,300
Does that mean PR has
no value without you? - Yes

1769
02:16:32,600 --> 02:16:33,500
I want my share.

1770
02:16:35,600 --> 02:16:39,300
- Ok, how much?
- 500/0 that means 500 crores

1771
02:16:40,100 --> 02:16:43,400
Wearing coats?
I won't give even 10/0

1772
02:16:43,500 --> 02:16:46,200
He served you till now.
How dare you talk like that?

1773
02:16:46,600 --> 02:16:49,600
If we have to play cards
we compulsorily need a joker.

1774
02:16:50,600 --> 02:16:53,800
What did you say?
Joker?

1775
02:16:54,300 --> 02:16:58,600
- What's that?
- That is... Seshu is beating Kranthi.

1776
02:17:01,900 --> 02:17:04,100
Seshu! Leave him.

1777
02:17:06,100 --> 02:17:08,200
Are you beating my son?

1778
02:17:09,200 --> 02:17:10,700
Do you think he is your servant?

1779
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:11,800
He is my son.

1780
02:17:12,800 --> 02:17:14,500
He said that I am his servant.

1781
02:17:14,900 --> 02:17:17,600
- He spoke to me disrespectfully.
- Yes Dad.

1782
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:19,100
Do you know what he said?

1783
02:17:19,400 --> 02:17:20,700
He said you're not
what you are without him.

1784
02:17:21,300 --> 02:17:23,200
- He is asking for a share.
- That is true.

1785
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:25,700
Without me PR wouldn't
have achieved all this.

1786
02:17:26,500 --> 02:17:27,400
PR is a Joker.

1787
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:29,700
What are you talking?

1788
02:17:30,400 --> 02:17:32,200
I should have killed you
in Varalakshmi's matter.

1789
02:17:32,600 --> 02:17:34,900
- Lf you come in my dad's...
- No dear.

1790
02:17:35,500 --> 02:17:36,300
What did you say?

1791
02:17:37,400 --> 02:17:38,500
Do you want a share?

1792
02:17:39,400 --> 02:17:42,900
My son is the heir to my whole property.

1793
02:17:43,600 --> 02:17:44,900
Not you.
You are a servant.

1794
02:17:46,300 --> 02:17:48,200
I am well off with my son.
You go.

1795
02:17:49,900 --> 02:17:50,700
I'll kill you.

1796
02:17:52,700 --> 02:17:53,600
Go.
- Come brother.

1797
02:17:54,600 --> 02:17:55,500
Go.

1798
02:17:57,000 --> 02:17:58,000
Dad!

1799
02:17:58,600 --> 02:18:02,900
Call Doctor.
Was he disturbed?

1800
02:18:03,000 --> 02:18:04,900
There was a tussle.
After that he...

1801
02:18:06,800 --> 02:18:08,100
He won't recover with tablets.

1802
02:18:11,500 --> 02:18:13,500
If you delay for the operation
he will be in danger.

1803
02:18:15,400 --> 02:18:18,600
Dass, please forget
all our angry and enmity

1804
02:18:19,700 --> 02:18:21,500
Let us join hands
and kill that P. R

1805
02:18:22,400 --> 02:18:23,500
Sesha brother is also with us.

1806
02:18:24,800 --> 02:18:25,900
Please help me.

1807
02:18:34,600 --> 02:18:36,200
After <i>27</i> years for the first time...

1808
02:18:36,600 --> 02:18:38,800
...that PR has become weak
and I've become strong.

1809
02:18:39,500 --> 02:18:41,500
That's why I've invited you
when he told me.

1810
02:18:41,600 --> 02:18:44,700
He cheated him despite his
<i>27</i> years association with him.

1811
02:18:45,300 --> 02:18:48,700
We had earned in crores.
I was miss that.

1812
02:18:48,900 --> 02:18:50,200
Won't you miss your daughter?

1813
02:18:52,300 --> 02:18:53,000
You will be happy.

1814
02:18:53,200 --> 02:18:55,000
Both of them will die.

1815
02:18:55,500 --> 02:18:56,500
Property will come to me

1816
02:18:57,500 --> 02:18:58,700
I will give 500/0

1817
02:18:59,300 --> 02:19:02,000
One person has come from
Hong kong with the same idea.

1818
02:19:02,400 --> 02:19:03,600
Viruji, come.

1819
02:19:07,900 --> 02:19:09,000
That day he was in PR party

1820
02:19:09,100 --> 02:19:10,200
Now we are all in the same party.

1821
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:13,500
Enemy's enemy is our friend
We are friends.

1822
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:15,900
We are join together and kill them.

1823
02:19:16,300 --> 02:19:18,900
Now, one king is in city. Dass.

1824
02:19:20,100 --> 02:19:21,900
If PR dies his property
will go to his son.

1825
02:19:22,400 --> 02:19:24,000
If his son dies his property
will go to orphanage home.

1826
02:19:24,900 --> 02:19:27,800
First we should usurp his property
then we'll kill both of them.

1827
02:19:31,300 --> 02:19:32,700
Brother, tomorrow is PR's operation.

1828
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:34,700
He has just a 500/0 chance

1829
02:19:34,800 --> 02:19:36,200
You be there and give information often.

1830
02:19:37,600 --> 02:19:38,500
Tomorrow is PR's operation.

1831
02:19:39,400 --> 02:19:41,000
He said he has only 500/0 chance to live.

1832
02:19:41,200 --> 02:19:43,000
It's ok, he will die
before we kill him.

1833
02:19:43,200 --> 02:19:44,700
If he dies, what will happen
to the property?

1834
02:19:44,900 --> 02:19:46,500
Whatever that happens should
happen before the operation

1835
02:19:48,500 --> 02:19:49,600
When we get money...

1836
02:19:49,900 --> 02:19:52,300
How he killed my brother in front of me...

1837
02:19:53,300 --> 02:19:56,500
...I will kill that PR's son
in front of him.

1838
02:19:57,700 --> 02:19:58,800
Hey, make arrangements for it.

1839
02:20:03,600 --> 02:20:04,700
Dear PR!

1840
02:20:05,500 --> 02:20:06,800
Kids are equal to God.

1841
02:20:07,400 --> 02:20:10,400
They are praying God
to cure your health.

1842
02:20:10,600 --> 02:20:12,400
Dad, nothing will happen

1843
02:20:12,500 --> 02:20:14,000
Operation will be successful.

1844
02:20:15,500 --> 02:20:16,400
Have you seen?

1845
02:20:17,000 --> 02:20:18,600
You said you don't have
any relations and sentiments

1846
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:20,200
See, how they are affection with you?

1847
02:20:20,300 --> 02:20:21,600
This is the relation.

1848
02:20:21,900 --> 02:20:24,700
Kranthi, you have to
sign the risk declaration

1849
02:20:34,900 --> 02:20:35,800
Please, he is in medication

1850
02:20:36,900 --> 02:20:37,800
In my hand...

1851
02:20:39,500 --> 02:20:40,400
Don't get excited

1852
02:20:41,600 --> 02:20:42,400
He is in a coma...

1853
02:20:43,600 --> 02:20:44,500
We have many work with him...

1854
02:20:45,500 --> 02:20:46,400
We need not tell more.

1855
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:49,700
If you want this operation to
happen and wish your son to be alive...

1856
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:51,800
...you have to transfer
your property to me.

1857
02:20:51,900 --> 02:20:53,100
Didn't you say that your son is enough?

1858
02:20:53,400 --> 02:20:55,500
Then you give your property
with my brother. - I won't give.

1859
02:20:56,300 --> 02:20:57,500
I don't want money but you.

1860
02:20:57,700 --> 02:21:00,700
You give them.
- Dear!

1861
02:21:01,100 --> 02:21:03,300
Oh God! What a sentimental scene!

1862
02:21:03,800 --> 02:21:05,800
See the formalities.

1863
02:21:06,900 --> 02:21:08,800
Prepare a Power of attorney
in his son's favour.

1864
02:21:09,900 --> 02:21:12,600
Like his heir.
He will give everything.

1865
02:21:13,900 --> 02:21:16,200
He likes his father.

1866
02:21:19,100 --> 02:21:24,500
Call Hong Kong Banerji to tell transfer
all the money for my accounts.

1867
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:34,900
Transfer the whole amount to them

1868
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:36,100
- Whole amount?
- To Seshu.

1869
02:21:36,300 --> 02:21:37,100
Transfer the amount to Seshu.

1870
02:21:50,400 --> 02:21:53,100
- Brother
- You go with them.

1871
02:21:53,300 --> 02:21:54,600
Call me often

1872
02:21:55,200 --> 02:21:57,400
Use Banks, Havala and the whole network.

1873
02:21:57,600 --> 02:22:02,200
House, sights, black money
I don't want a share...

1874
02:22:03,400 --> 02:22:04,700
...but the whole wealth.

1875
02:22:07,000 --> 02:22:08,900
I will give money how much you want.

1876
02:22:09,700 --> 02:22:11,700
If anything happens to my dad...

1877
02:22:12,300 --> 02:22:16,200
...I won't spare anyone.

1878
02:22:17,800 --> 02:22:18,600
Dad!

1879
02:22:19,900 --> 02:22:21,100
Be careful.

1880
02:22:22,500 --> 02:22:24,200
- Be careful
- Careful.

1881
02:23:00,800 --> 02:23:03,200
Brother, everything is original.

1882
02:23:03,700 --> 02:23:05,500
They don't have anything.

1883
02:23:05,800 --> 02:23:07,200
We will bring full money.

1884
02:23:09,000 --> 02:23:10,900
We will take 100 crores and leave him.

1885
02:23:11,600 --> 02:23:12,400
What do you say?

1886
02:23:14,400 --> 02:23:15,800
I am also thought so.

1887
02:23:20,200 --> 02:23:21,200
Van has come.

1888
02:23:21,800 --> 02:23:23,000
Go, go fast.

1889
02:23:23,200 --> 02:23:25,200
Go.

1890
02:23:31,700 --> 02:23:32,500
Open it.

1891
02:23:36,100 --> 02:23:36,900
See there.

1892
02:23:40,600 --> 02:23:41,600
Where is the money?

1893
02:23:46,700 --> 02:23:48,500
Brother! Acid brother.

1894
02:23:53,300 --> 02:23:56,100
- What happened?
- Brother, where is the money?

1895
02:23:56,600 --> 02:23:57,800
Why are you asked me?
Where is money?

1896
02:23:57,900 --> 02:23:59,700
Brother, we kept the money only in this.

1897
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:00,900
After that what happened is...

1898
02:24:02,300 --> 02:24:03,100
Oh God!

1899
02:24:03,600 --> 02:24:05,000
Why am I here?

1900
02:24:05,400 --> 02:24:07,000
Where is Bairagi?

1901
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:09,700
Brother, PR is not seen.

1902
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:29,700
Dig carefully there.

1903
02:24:30,600 --> 02:24:32,900
Remove it fast.

1904
02:24:33,700 --> 02:24:34,900
Time is up for another shooting.

1905
02:24:35,000 --> 02:24:36,500
Hey, where are you taking that tomb?

1906
02:24:36,700 --> 02:24:37,800
That is my wife's tomb.

1907
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:40,200
Allt his is a setup. Work is over.
Hence we're taking it out.

1908
02:24:40,900 --> 02:24:41,700
Careful.

1909
02:25:13,100 --> 02:25:14,100
Dear Kranthi!

1910
02:25:14,500 --> 02:25:17,300
You are not my dad and
I am not your son.

1911
02:25:19,500 --> 02:25:23,500
Now you know what is called betrayal

1912
02:25:24,200 --> 02:25:25,500
Pothuraju.

1913
02:25:27,300 --> 02:25:31,100
Whole property earned by your sins...

1914
02:25:31,600 --> 02:25:33,100
...now that is for me.

1915
02:25:35,500 --> 02:25:36,400
Haven't you understand?

1916
02:25:36,800 --> 02:25:37,700
Grandpa.

1917
02:25:53,300 --> 02:25:54,300
Do you remember?

1918
02:25:55,000 --> 02:25:58,100
I am son of Krishna
whom you killed...

1919
02:26:00,900 --> 02:26:02,000
I am still alive.

1920
02:26:03,600 --> 02:26:05,100
That enmity gave the life.

1921
02:26:06,600 --> 02:26:11,900
I was waiting for 20 years
to see you in this situation.

1922
02:26:13,700 --> 02:26:16,800
You killed my son and
daughter-in-law in front of me.

1923
02:26:18,400 --> 02:26:19,800
You thought I also died.

1924
02:26:20,800 --> 02:26:25,400
But I and my grandson escaped.

1925
02:26:29,300 --> 02:26:33,000
People aspire make their son
as a Doctor or an Engineer.

1926
02:26:33,700 --> 02:26:37,800
But I brought up my grandson for enmity.

1927
02:26:38,900 --> 02:26:40,600
I made him as a weapon.

1928
02:26:45,400 --> 02:26:46,800
You rascal...

1929
02:26:47,700 --> 02:26:50,200
Yes, I am but not your son.

1930
02:26:50,800 --> 02:26:53,000
I used it to enter your powerful network.

1931
02:26:53,500 --> 02:26:54,300
Bairagi,

1932
02:26:56,700 --> 02:26:57,500
He is also my man.

1933
02:26:58,900 --> 02:27:00,900
He is the son of Siva whom you killed

1934
02:27:02,900 --> 02:27:06,400
He joined us regretting
his father's wrongs.

1935
02:27:09,100 --> 02:27:12,500
I made him join you after
knowing your whereabouts.

1936
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:16,400
Later I entered
and was praised by you.

1937
02:27:16,700 --> 02:27:18,400
I did all that for him.

1938
02:27:18,500 --> 02:27:20,500
I brought you the situation
as I expected.

1939
02:27:21,100 --> 02:27:23,000
You don't have any sentiments...

1940
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:27,100
...I made you a fool by
presenting me as your son.

1941
02:27:27,800 --> 02:27:29,900
I planned to separate you and Seshu.

1942
02:27:30,300 --> 02:27:32,100
Finally I made you alone.

1943
02:27:35,500 --> 02:27:40,100
Doctor, Hospital, operation, affection,
son, tomb everything is an illusion.

1944
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:46,200
It was me who hit you that day.

1945
02:27:54,800 --> 02:27:56,000
You don't have any disease

1946
02:27:56,500 --> 02:27:58,000
That was setup by me.

1947
02:27:59,300 --> 02:28:01,200
We intoxicated you to feel giddy

1948
02:28:07,200 --> 02:28:10,600
You killed my mom and
dad earned the wealth...

1949
02:28:11,300 --> 02:28:13,100
...but now I've made you penniless.

1950
02:28:13,800 --> 02:28:15,400
One moment is enough for me to kill you.

1951
02:28:16,300 --> 02:28:18,700
But my Grandpa asked me
to kill the demon inside you.

1952
02:28:22,200 --> 02:28:24,600
If you again cross my way...

1953
02:28:25,600 --> 02:28:27,500
I am not a good man like my Grandpa.

1954
02:28:35,900 --> 02:28:37,100
No, Thirupathi.

1955
02:28:37,900 --> 02:28:39,500
I am junior artist supplier in cinema.

1956
02:28:39,800 --> 02:28:40,900
All are artistes.

1957
02:28:42,300 --> 02:28:44,300
Your whole property has gone isn't it?

1958
02:28:44,700 --> 02:28:45,900
Now, what would you do?

1959
02:28:46,400 --> 02:28:47,900
You do one thing.
You come with me.

1960
02:28:48,200 --> 02:28:50,800
Daily you'll get 200 Rupees tips
Morning and evening free food.

1961
02:28:51,400 --> 02:28:52,400
His eyes are very nice.

1962
02:28:52,800 --> 02:28:56,100
If you act well
you will become a big actor...

1963
02:28:56,400 --> 02:28:58,600
...and you can become rich.

1964
02:29:00,800 --> 02:29:03,200
Damn! What's this confusion?

1965
02:29:04,300 --> 02:29:05,600
You lost him...

1966
02:29:06,900 --> 02:29:07,700
Go man!

1967
02:29:09,200 --> 02:29:10,600
I did a mistake

1968
02:29:11,500 --> 02:29:13,900
I should have done it myself

1969
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:18,800
I don't know what happened

1970
02:29:36,100 --> 02:29:36,900
He has cheated me.

1971
02:29:38,100 --> 02:29:39,200
He is not my son.

1972
02:29:42,200 --> 02:29:43,600
- What are you talking?
- I swear man.

1973
02:29:44,700 --> 02:29:46,200
He is the son of Krishna who we killed.

1974
02:29:47,400 --> 02:29:48,400
That old man is still alive.

1975
02:29:49,800 --> 02:29:54,300
He separated us and
usurp our whole property...

1976
02:29:57,400 --> 02:29:58,700
I want your help.

1977
02:30:00,600 --> 02:30:03,400
If anyone seeks help from me,
even he is my enemy, I'll help him.

1978
02:30:04,500 --> 02:30:06,000
Great PR wants help from me.

1979
02:30:06,600 --> 02:30:07,400
Hey!

1980
02:30:08,500 --> 02:30:10,200
Why do we need his friendship talks?

1981
02:30:10,800 --> 02:30:12,400
I want his life.

1982
02:30:12,600 --> 02:30:13,900
Leave him.
- Leave me.

1983
02:30:29,400 --> 02:30:32,400
K.R. Wants him to die.
What disturbance is this?

1984
02:30:33,700 --> 02:30:37,200
He had hit my weakness
and the Biragi has made me a fool

1985
02:30:38,100 --> 02:30:40,000
I want Kranthi's life.
How to do it?

1986
02:30:50,900 --> 02:30:52,300
- Take him inside.
- Ok sir.

1987
02:30:54,400 --> 02:30:55,300
Tell me Kranthi.

1988
02:30:55,900 --> 02:30:57,900
Varalakshmi and her family
should leave this town.

1989
02:30:58,600 --> 02:31:00,300
We will also start after
finishing bank work

1990
02:31:00,900 --> 02:31:03,000
You take Chinna and wait outside.

1991
02:31:03,600 --> 02:31:04,700
Ok I will start immediately.

1992
02:31:05,300 --> 02:31:07,700
Hong kong amount and
Hyderabad property amounts...

1993
02:31:08,000 --> 02:31:10,100
...if you change by cash
it's approximately 300 crores.

1994
02:31:10,300 --> 02:31:13,100
It's deposited to your father's
Krishna charitable Trust

1995
02:31:13,300 --> 02:31:15,200
Now you can start your
social welfare programmes.

1996
02:31:26,800 --> 02:31:27,600
Tell me Bairagi.

1997
02:31:28,400 --> 02:31:32,800
Not Bairagi. Your dad.
Sorry, it has become habitual.

1998
02:31:35,000 --> 02:31:38,200
Where is Bairagi?
- He is with me.

1999
02:31:40,100 --> 02:31:42,500
You come to Golconda fort and
give me my money...

2000
02:31:42,600 --> 02:31:43,800
...and rescue him.

2001
02:31:44,600 --> 02:31:47,600
Else you won't have you
Varalakshmi, Grandpa, and your village.

2002
02:31:47,800 --> 02:31:49,700
Come you Rascal.

2003
02:32:08,200 --> 02:32:11,800
Bairagi, speak man

2004
02:32:25,400 --> 02:32:26,200
Where is Chinna?

2005
02:32:27,300 --> 02:32:30,800
Chinna was there.
Please save him.

2006
02:34:11,300 --> 02:34:12,100
Where?

2007
02:34:59,100 --> 02:35:01,400
Hey, see there.

2008
02:35:11,400 --> 02:35:13,000
Brother!

2009
02:35:13,800 --> 02:35:15,900
He killed both of them.

2010
02:36:45,700 --> 02:36:47,600
I will kill him.
Kill him.

2011
02:36:48,400 --> 02:36:49,600
You kill him.

2012
02:36:50,400 --> 02:36:51,800
He is your son.

2013
02:36:52,500 --> 02:36:53,500
Kill him.

2014
02:36:56,400 --> 02:36:58,600
Brother!

2015
02:36:58,900 --> 02:37:02,900
After your wife's death
my grandpa only brought him up.

2016
02:37:03,700 --> 02:37:05,800
I took care like my brother
Kill him.

2017
02:37:07,600 --> 02:37:10,100
You did all the sins
But it affected him.

2018
02:37:19,400 --> 02:37:21,000
Didn't I tell you?

2019
02:37:21,400 --> 02:37:24,200
I am not a good man like my Grandpa.
