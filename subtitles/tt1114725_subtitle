00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


3
00:02:38,416 --> 00:02:42,000
An unheard name that suddenly came to the limelight... 

4
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:44,083
A name where the fights in the mountains... 

5
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:46,208
...turned green camouflage red. 

6
00:02:52,375 --> 00:02:54,250
To win back these mountains from the enemy... 

7
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:56,375
...near the national highway number one... 

8
00:02:56,458 --> 00:02:59,291
...the Indian army is making arduous efforts. 

9
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:01,583
After a difficult battle of two months... 

10
00:03:01,666 --> 00:03:04,000
...only six mountains are left. 

11
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:12,000
Let's meet some of these soldiers who are trying... 

12
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:14,208
...to win back these mountains. 

13
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:18,166
Akash Sarin. IBN 7. 

14
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:23,458
Balkar Singh, aren't you afraid of bullets? 

15
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:26,500
I am. 

16
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:30,958
But not for me, for the sake of our people. 

17
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:35,916
Because when the bullet hits the target... 

18
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:39,375
...it pierces our hearts.. 

19
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:43,750
..and passes through the hearts of our dear ones. 

20
00:03:44,916 --> 00:03:46,625
What do you think about the war? 

21
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:51,458
The real war used to take place between Kings and Emperors. 

22
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:55,541
Some of the soldiers came forward and fought. 

23
00:03:58,166 --> 00:04:01,250
Balkar Singh tell me, when will this war end? 

24
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:06,916
The day when our leaders and ministers... 

25
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:10,000
...who give us orders to fight... 

26
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:14,333
...when thy go along with us and fight. 

27
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:17,500
The day the war will get over. 

28
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:21,708
Do you get a chance to talk to your family? 

29
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,541
Each one to his own destiny. 

30
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,833
Do you write letters? 

31
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:34,041
Yes, I write letters. We do write letters. 

32
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,375
What do you write? 

33
00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:39,458
Are you a reporter or a spy? 

34
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:45,625
Here, you keep it. 

35
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:52,333
But if something happens to me, don't post it. 

36
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:56,041
Why? - Because this letter has my dreams written in it. 

37
00:04:58,041 --> 00:05:00,250
Which I will never be able to fulfill. 

38
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:07,833
Writing a letter is tradition which we follow. 

39
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:11,041
Actually even I have written a letter. 

40
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:14,708
You can keep it. 

41
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:17,083
It'll be of use in your research. 

42
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:19,041
I don't need it. 

43
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:21,291
Because if something happens to me... 

44
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:23,333
...the Army will call my brother. 

45
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:24,958
And he will fly me back. 

46
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:26,916
Brother? 

47
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:29,958
Squadron leader, Vikram Shergill. 

48
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:31,708
And yes... 

49
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:35,458
If you see him, tell him I will be back 

50
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:37,250
...to kick his ass. 

51
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:43,583
Sir! Excuse me, Sir! 

52
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:45,833
Sir... 

53
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:52,250
Sir, are you going back? - Yes. 

54
00:05:53,583 --> 00:05:57,875
Can you post this for me in Kargil? - Yes. Sure. 

55
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:00,583
Who is it for? - Leave application, sir. 

56
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:02,708
I'll post it. - Thank you, sir. 

57
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:03,916
You're welcome. 

58
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:11,875
But before I could post the letter. 

59
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:14,500
I got the news that Sahil Naqvi sacrificed his life. 

60
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:17,541
Along with the remaining three mountains... 

61
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:20,250
...three people were left just for namesake... 

62
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:26,291
Balkar Singh, Dhananjay Shergill, Sahil Naqvi. 

63
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:28,041
And many more like them. 

64
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:41,083
This is not a story of three soldiers. 

65
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:42,833
This story is about our country. 

66
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,833
"Loneliness." 

67
00:06:48,916 --> 00:06:51,166
Will you put me to sleep? Change the channel! 

68
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:58,416
"Uncle moon has slept and uncle sun has waked up." 

69
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,958
Hey! Turn right from ahead. - "Hold the needles of the watch... 

70
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:03,083
...they are running." 

71
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:06,250
"One story has ended and the... 

72
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:11,000
...other has begun, uncle." 

73
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:17,500
"Uncle, the sun has risen." 

74
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:24,250
Hey! Stop! Take this, enjoy yourself. 

75
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:36,375
This is fine. 

76
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:40,291
Hi, baby! 

77
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:42,000
It's for you. 

78
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:43,166
Thank you. 

79
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:47,916
Nice pants. - Oh! Just bought them today. 

80
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,708
Come in. C'mon in. 

81
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:52,000
I hope your parents aren't there inside? 

82
00:07:57,416 --> 00:08:00,083
This leather pant is boiling. 

83
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:03,083
Come, close baby! 

84
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:05,208
Uh... Can I use your toilet please? 

85
00:08:06,416 --> 00:08:09,500
Stop! - Why? - Safety baby! 

86
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,250
I thought you would have it! 

87
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:13,708
What! Why would I have it! Fool! 

88
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,416
Ok! Two minutes! - What?! 

89
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,708
What a relief! - Come fast, sweetheart! 

90
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:23,916
Coming baby! 

91
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:33,375
Give me the keys of the bike. I'll be back in a jiffy! 

92
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:36,791
Sam, it's risky. What if my Dad sees you? 

93
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,500
I've been waiting for a month. Don't make me wait any more. 

94
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:42,000
Either way I have never seen your father and neither has he seen me. 

95
00:08:42,083 --> 00:08:43,208
And even if he sees me... 

96
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:44,666
...just tell him that a friend had borrowed his bike. 

97
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,958
Sammy! These are Dad's shorts! 

98
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,166
They are clean, right? 

99
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:49,958
Give me the keys. 

100
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:55,000
Baby! I'll be back! 

101
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:09,416
What's up, Nawab Saab (sir)? Where are you? 

102
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,291
Saand, I am in deep trouble. - Tell me, what happened? 

103
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:14,166
Saand, I was wearing those leather pants... 

104
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,250
Nawab Saab, you have worn it but do not remove it. 

105
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:18,375
Once you remove it, you won't be able to wear it again. 

106
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:20,000
It shirks with sweat and heat 

107
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,708
Saand, I've made that mistake. 

108
00:09:22,791 --> 00:09:24,000
Oh Nawab Saab, you are screwed! 

109
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:27,416
I had told you not to wear leather pants in the summers of Delhi. 

110
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,833
Now give me a solution. 

111
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:30,916
Ok, Nawab Saab, is there any cream around? 

112
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,833
Cream? Yes. Some hair remove. 

113
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:39,541
Don't think... apply it immediately! Cream is a lubricant. 

114
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:40,916
In a second, it's done. 

115
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:46,833
I've found the safety. 

116
00:09:46,916 --> 00:09:50,083
Baby, I've a surprise for you. 

117
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:51,333
Oh shit! 

118
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:56,291
Saand, it has formed some strange... 

119
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:58,625
...paste and even my hair is falling off. 

120
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:03,083
Nawab Saab, you have applied hair removal cream... 

121
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:04,458
You were the one who told me to do that. 

122
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:05,833
Hey, Nawab Saab, not fair. 

123
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:08,041
you can't blame me for everything, ok? 

124
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:09,583
Go, I'm not talking to you. Go! 

125
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:11,625
Oh, Saand, oh, Saand, listen, listen, listen... 

126
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:14,166
You idiot! You too will suffer! 

127
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:19,000
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! 

128
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:21,166
Hey uncle, you found my bike to jump across to kill yourself? 

129
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:27,666
Oh! Your bike! Anyway, son, I'm going up to staff quarters. 

130
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:28,833
Can I hitch a ride? 

131
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:30,750
Come on sit! - Thank you. 

132
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:32,666
Come on sit! - Yes. 

133
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:39,041
Son, take a right from ahead... which way are you going? 

134
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:40,416
I am also going that way. 

135
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:45,333
Go slow, son. Looks like you are in a hurry! 

136
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:48,250
Uncle, one doesn't get such a chance often. 

137
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:51,125
The girl is alone at home. I am going to give her company. 

138
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:53,916
You never did ding-dong during your heydays? 

139
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:58,750
Ding-dong? And son, what about the girl's father? 

140
00:10:58,916 --> 00:11:00,375
He's not there. - What? 

141
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:02,916
That fool has left early in the morning to give tuition to someone... 

142
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,041
...leaving his daughter alone at home. 

143
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:11,166
Son, just stop after these two houses. 

144
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,875
Enough, enough, enough, enough. 

145
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,958
Uncle! - I've reached! 

146
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,166
Do you live some where around here? 

147
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Forget about me. Tell me about you, you want to go here? 

148
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:23,000
Oh yes uncle! How do you know? 

149
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:27,000
Son, that is because the bike that you are riding is mine. 

150
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:32,583
And the shorts that you are wearing also belong to me. 

151
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:35,791
And the wonderful thing is that the house... 

152
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:38,125
...where you want to go is also mine. 

153
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,791
Father has come back after giving his tuition, son. 

154
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:44,791
Baby. 

155
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:51,291
Saand, idiot! You are going to get thrashed! 

156
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:53,458
You've seen my condition! What have you made me do? 

157
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,750
Nawab Saab, it's all because of you! 

158
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:57,416
Because of me! And do you know, there is a... 

159
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,000
...party at Shivani's house today? 

160
00:11:59,083 --> 00:12:01,000
I've lost that opportunity too! - Party! What are you saying? 

161
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:04,458
Party! Nawab Saab, I've an idea! 

162
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:09,291
Hey girls, the strippers are here! 

163
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:10,500
Wow. 

164
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:13,291
It's interesting! Wow. 

165
00:12:26,166 --> 00:12:29,666
"Now we're gonna teach you never gonna let you go." 

166
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:33,000
"Now we're gonna teach you never gonna let you go." 

167
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:47,250
"Heart obtained such a gem..." 

168
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:49,833
"Hey, girls. Let's have some fun." 

169
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:53,375
"Heart obtained such a gem... 

170
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:56,250
...I feel I'm flying high." 

171
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:58,166
"Isn't he cute?" 

172
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:00,041
"Where to start from?" 

173
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:01,708
"These..." 

174
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:06,000
"These mischievous guys." 

175
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:09,375
"These mischievous guys." 

176
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:17,583
"Heart obtained such a gem I feel I'm flying high." 

177
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:23,958
"Heart obtained such a gem I feel I'm flying high." 

178
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,541
"These mischievous guys!" 

179
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:29,916
"These mischievous guys!" 

180
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:41,291
"In your hearts, in your lips... 

181
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:45,000
...in your hair, we want to touch you everywhere." 

182
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:47,875
"Hey, handsome guy!" 

183
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:51,416
"Hey, handsome guy!" 

184
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:54,750
"Hey, handsome guy!" 

185
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:58,500
"Don't lock your eyes, it may kill you." 

186
00:13:58,583 --> 00:14:01,958
"It might land you into trouble." 

187
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,375
"Tell me how do you find this slap?" 

188
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:09,625
"...I feel I'm flying high." 

189
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:12,125
"These mischievous guys!" 

190
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:36,166
"Fall in love..." 

191
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:39,625
"Make me..." 

192
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:43,083
"Fall in love with me." 

193
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:49,916
"Make me yours." 

194
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,666
"Take away the knife..." 

195
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,375
"Take away the knife..." 

196
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:56,458
"Take away the knife..." 

197
00:14:56,541 --> 00:15:01,958
"Let's welcome this golden moment." 

198
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,250
"Let's welcome..." 

199
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:07,000
"Let's welcome this golden moment." 

200
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:10,291
"I feel I'm flying high." 

201
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:11,666
"These..." 

202
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,291
"These..." 

203
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:14,583
"Guys!" 

204
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,583
"These mischievous guys!" 

205
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:22,958
"These mischievous guys!" 

206
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:27,625
"Heart obtained such a gem... 

207
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:31,000
...I feel I'm flying high." 

208
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:33,083
"These mischievous guys!" 

209
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:36,125
"Yes, mischievous guys... These mischievous guys!" 

210
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:38,041
"These mischievous guys!" 

211
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:41,375
"Come into my life, o beloved." 

212
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:44,791
"You're not less than a roadside Romeo." 

213
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:48,166
"Your beauty is really amazing." 

214
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:51,666
"Just get lost, don't try to flatter me." 

215
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,416
"You've created uproar in my heart." 

216
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,083
"Mind it, I'm the lioness." 

217
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:56,791
"My heart says I love you." 

218
00:15:56,875 --> 00:16:00,208
"You're a museum piece." 

219
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:03,833
"Give me one chance to show my talent." 

220
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:06,833
"This victory will be a fun." 

221
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:09,625
"How will you survive today?" 

222
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:11,375
"How will you survive today?" 

223
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:14,541
"How will you survive?" - "These mischievous guys." 

224
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:17,166
"These mischievous guys." 

225
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:18,500
Stop it! 

226
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:21,083
I know him. 

227
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:24,000
He is not a stripper. - Who cares! 

228
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:27,791
I think he should leave. 

229
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:33,000
Hey, Nawab Saab, where are you going? Say sorry to the CHICK. 

230
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:36,583
I am mean sorry! To the ladies! 

231
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,416
Sorry. 

232
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,666
Institute of film making announces... 

233
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:48,125
...the graduation of the present batch 

234
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:51,833
It is said that a new generation brings in a new vision. 

235
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:55,000
You'll form the new age of Cinema. 

236
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:59,083
But some students who have scored less marks will... 

237
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:06,000
...have to submit a graduate film to get their degrees. 

238
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:12,583
For others, I congratulate you as you stand graduates. 

239
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:15,958
I've passed! 

240
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:18,625
I've passed! 

241
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:22,625
Nawab Saab. 

242
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:23,916
Congratulations! 

243
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:29,041
Mr. Sameer Suri and Mr. Ali Shah. 

244
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:31,750
I'd like to see you in my office. 

245
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:33,833
Sir, have we come first? 

246
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:36,083
Yes, but from the back. 

247
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:40,833
Do you know in this whole batch. Only your grades are least? 

248
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:42,166
Only us? - Yes. 

249
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:45,166
You've not attended a single lecture 

250
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:47,583
And have failed the practical as well. 

251
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:49,458
No sir we have attended two practical. 

252
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:50,666
The ones in which we cheated 

253
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,833
And we come to college everyday. - Really? 

254
00:17:53,541 --> 00:17:54,666
Meet him. 

255
00:17:58,375 --> 00:17:59,541
Who is he? 

256
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,291
Uncle! 

257
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:07,041
He's Piya's dad. Hello, uncle. How are you? 

258
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:09,625
Not uncle, son. Your professor. 

259
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:12,791
When did this happen? - Since the last term. 

260
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:15,750
Piya told me he tutors. 

261
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:18,375
Sir, you can imagine the caliber of these two... 

262
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:22,000
...who don't even know who their professor is. 

263
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:24,125
Correct, uncle. - Yes, correct. 

264
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:27,958
You'll have to submit a graduation film. 

265
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:31,083
Or else I will not give you a graduation certificate. 

266
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:34,458
Without which you can not apply for your American visa. 

267
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:36,125
But, sir - Enough. 

268
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,416
If you want to go to America, get me the film. 

269
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:49,125
Why are you two so happy? 

270
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:50,833
You have not even graduated. 

271
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:53,125
But we can not tell our family that. 

272
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:56,875
Think about it, the only heir to the Royal family of Indore fails! 

273
00:18:57,458 --> 00:18:59,500
And your dad would congratulate you right? 

274
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:01,791
Why do you always get into problems together? 

275
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:03,791
Because since childhood we had pledged... 

276
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:05,291
...to live and die together. 

277
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:13,958
Ali, have you thought of the topic for the film,? 

278
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:19,958
Don't think too much, Nawab Saab. 

279
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,625
We're making a porn movie. - What? 

280
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:23,125
'A night in the forest.' 

281
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:25,166
And do you know who will be our forest queen? 

282
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:27,791
Piya. - Shut up! 

283
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:37,541
We thought under the pretext of post-graduation 

284
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:39,166
We will enjoy a vacation for 2 years in America. 

285
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:42,416
But now we will have to make a film. Or else. 

286
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,458
Or else, vacation cancelled. 

287
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:48,291
We joined the course thinking that everything would be easy 

288
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:49,916
But Nawab Saab, this has become a pain. 

289
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:54,291
Saand, what do you think should be the topic of our film? 

290
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:57,833
Religion, politics, socio-economics. 

291
00:19:58,375 --> 00:19:59,625
Easy, Nawab Saab. Easy. 

292
00:19:59,708 --> 00:20:00,916
We can not even spell most of these words. 

293
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,500
What was that? Socio. Shoo-shoo. 

294
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:07,291
Why don't you make a film on joining the Indian Defense Forces? 

295
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:09,625
Indian Defense? 

296
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:12,208
This is all what a cadet of the military academy can suggest. 

297
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:13,583
Shut up! 

298
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:15,500
And why are you doing it? 

299
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:17,833
Who joins the defense force these days? 

300
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:20,083
I will. - You'll die if you join. 

301
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:21,541
Looks like You are looking for a one-day job? 

302
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:23,041
You get shot straight in the head. 

303
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:27,458
It's of no use. 

304
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:29,916
In news channels, they show it in the subtitles... 

305
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,500
...one soldier dead in cross firing.' 

306
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:34,958
Absolutely, You don't even get paid well enough. 

307
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:37,458
I just want that. - Amit is absolutely right. 

308
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:39,791
You're risking your life, And, what if you die? 

309
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:42,958
Right. And on top of that a grieving family! 

310
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:46,625
Nawab Saab, I've found a topic. 

311
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:48,166
The topic of our film. 

312
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:52,291
'Why one shouldn't join the defense forces? ' 

313
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,916
Amazing, Saand. 

314
00:20:57,333 --> 00:20:59,291
'Why not to join the defense forces.' 

315
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:00,750
Good one. 

316
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:03,583
Why do you guys always think negatively? 

317
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:08,250
Riya, whatever you've heard in the last one minute is right. 

318
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,208
We gave you 3 reasons but Karan... 

319
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:12,458
...couldn't... even give one. 

320
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:14,000
Maybe, I just don't have a reason. 

321
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:18,500
But I have an emotion that I cannot explain. 

322
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:21,625
Oh! Quiet! You find your emotion. 

323
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:23,583
Meanwhile Nawab Saab and I will make our film. 

324
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:29,166
You know, you two could meet my cousin. 

325
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:30,375
He's a war journalist. 

326
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:31,750
Maybe he could be of some help. 

327
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:34,583
Viola, there, our film is made, Nawab Saab. 

328
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:38,333
Good morning sir. - Good morning. 

329
00:21:40,583 --> 00:21:41,708
How is the chick at the reception, Nawab Saab? - Stop it Sam! 

330
00:21:41,791 --> 00:21:43,208
Are you Sameer? - Yes, sir. 

331
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,500
Hi. Akash Sarin. Piya's cousin. - Sameer. 

332
00:21:46,916 --> 00:21:48,625
Ali. - Sit down, sit down. 

333
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:51,083
So tell me. What can I do for you? 

334
00:21:51,166 --> 00:21:52,583
Akash, just like you... 

335
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:55,041
...we two graduated from the institution... Err, I mean... 

336
00:21:55,083 --> 00:21:57,041
I mean... - We've completed it, sir. 

337
00:21:57,125 --> 00:21:58,958
We've completed it, sir. Yes, Riya has told me about it. 

338
00:22:03,291 --> 00:22:06,500
For the graduation project we've decided to make... 

339
00:22:06,583 --> 00:22:08,958
...a film on 'Why not to join the Indian defense forces? ' 

340
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:11,458
'Why not to join the Indian defense forces? ' Yes. 

341
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,125
I see. Interesting. 

342
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:16,916
And Sir, we want you to share your war experiences with us. 

343
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,250
In a small interview sir. 

344
00:22:18,416 --> 00:22:20,875
Our film will be made, sir - here write 

345
00:22:24,583 --> 00:22:28,000
Well, you know I've a better idea than this interview. 

346
00:22:29,458 --> 00:22:31,916
Do you boys like adventure? 

347
00:22:34,791 --> 00:22:35,958
Any time, Sir! 

348
00:22:36,333 --> 00:22:37,875
Good. Come with me. 

349
00:22:46,083 --> 00:22:47,291
Excuse me. 

350
00:22:49,458 --> 00:22:51,583
Here, take these 3 letters to their addresses... 

351
00:22:51,916 --> 00:22:53,541
...and record your experience. 

352
00:22:53,625 --> 00:22:55,000
You'll get your film. 

353
00:23:00,791 --> 00:23:04,208
Sir, what's special about these letters? 

354
00:23:04,291 --> 00:23:07,125
These are the last letters. 

355
00:23:07,625 --> 00:23:08,833
Last letters? 

356
00:23:10,291 --> 00:23:13,000
There is a tradition in the Indian defense forces... 

357
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:17,333
Every solider writes a letter before leaving for war... 

358
00:23:17,416 --> 00:23:19,000
...which he keeps in his pocket. 

359
00:23:21,875 --> 00:23:23,625
If that soldier is martyred the defense... 

360
00:23:23,708 --> 00:23:26,000
...force posts that letter to his family. 

361
00:23:28,833 --> 00:23:32,333
That letter contains a few last emotions of that soldier... 

362
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,375
You two want to know why one shouldn't join the army, right? 

363
00:23:39,458 --> 00:23:41,791
Meet these families... You'll know it. 

364
00:23:42,291 --> 00:23:45,125
But sir, how did you get these letters? 

365
00:23:46,083 --> 00:23:47,833
It's my 3 years old research material. 

366
00:23:47,916 --> 00:23:49,166
Now it would be useful for you. 

367
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,125
All the best. - Thank you. 

368
00:23:51,208 --> 00:23:53,000
Good luck. - Thank you. Bye. 

369
00:24:32,458 --> 00:24:33,583
Listen you guys. 

370
00:24:33,666 --> 00:24:35,750
You both are doing something by your self for the first time. 

371
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:38,583
Sometimes a little step towards something takes... 

372
00:24:38,666 --> 00:24:40,833
...you to a lifelong path. 

373
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,833
I hope this is it for you guys. 

374
00:24:42,916 --> 00:24:44,041
Let's go. 

375
00:24:45,458 --> 00:24:47,708
Day one. Track of turn. 

376
00:24:47,791 --> 00:24:50,166
We are out to look for an answer to our question. 

377
00:24:50,666 --> 00:24:53,625
Whether one should join Indian Army or not. 

378
00:25:35,958 --> 00:25:43,500
"Olla Signor. - What's up, my bro?" 

379
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:51,791
"Two friends have left on a journey." 

380
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:56,708
"The distance and paths are nothing... 

381
00:25:56,791 --> 00:25:58,708
...when we are together." 

382
00:25:58,791 --> 00:26:01,041
"We've fun on the go." 

383
00:26:01,916 --> 00:26:09,750
"Olla Signor. - What's up, my bro?" 

384
00:26:09,916 --> 00:26:18,000
"Two friends have left on a journey." 

385
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:22,500
"The distance and paths are nothing... 

386
00:26:22,583 --> 00:26:24,583
...when we are together." 

387
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:27,916
"We'll have fun on the go." 

388
00:26:59,958 --> 00:27:01,833
"The muddy roads... 

389
00:27:01,916 --> 00:27:03,958
...are welcoming us with open arms." 

390
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,916
"And making some gestures." 

391
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,625
"You didn't understand... 

392
00:27:09,708 --> 00:27:11,958
...small thing. - What, pal?" 

393
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,291
"The road says, keep moving on." 

394
00:27:28,083 --> 00:27:32,000
"We'll reach for the sky as we're special." 

395
00:27:32,041 --> 00:27:37,541
"We've the license to rock and roll." 

396
00:27:37,916 --> 00:27:44,958
"Listen." Hey... signore! What's up, my bro?" 

397
00:27:45,333 --> 00:27:53,708
"Two friends have left on a journey." 

398
00:27:54,083 --> 00:27:58,041
"The distance and paths are nothing... 

399
00:27:58,083 --> 00:28:06,708
...when we are together. We'll have fun on the go." 

400
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,166
Hey! 

401
00:28:42,208 --> 00:28:43,833
Does anyone know Kuljeet Kaur's house? 

402
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:48,083
I know where you can find Kuljeet Kaur. 

403
00:28:48,583 --> 00:28:49,750
Yourself? 

404
00:28:49,833 --> 00:28:51,333
Saand praji (elder brother) -Nawab saab. 

405
00:28:51,666 --> 00:28:54,000
Easy, easy. Watch the potholes. 

406
00:28:55,916 --> 00:28:58,541
Gyani ji (learned grand father) says our country will go very far. 

407
00:28:58,833 --> 00:29:01,458
But with such roads a person remains there only. 

408
00:29:01,791 --> 00:29:03,500
How can the country move forwards on these kind of roads. 

409
00:29:03,583 --> 00:29:04,750
Stop, stop! 

410
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:06,500
Stop, stop! 

411
00:29:12,958 --> 00:29:14,416
There. That's Kuljeet Kaur. 

412
00:29:14,791 --> 00:29:16,083
Hey... Kuljeet! 

413
00:29:30,916 --> 00:29:32,083
Saand, camera. 

414
00:29:45,541 --> 00:29:48,000
Fool, you call your mother by her name. 

415
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:49,625
Have you any shame? 

416
00:29:49,708 --> 00:29:51,125
Mom... Shut up! 

417
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:53,583
Where did you find these sun glasses? 

418
00:29:54,541 --> 00:29:56,875
They are his, mom. They were looking for you. 

419
00:29:59,625 --> 00:30:01,125
Greetings. - Greetings. 

420
00:30:01,666 --> 00:30:02,791
Greetings. 

421
00:30:02,875 --> 00:30:05,750
We're students. We've come here from Delhi to make a film. 

422
00:30:06,166 --> 00:30:07,458
We've brought this letter for you. 

423
00:30:08,625 --> 00:30:09,958
Can we record it? 

424
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:11,375
Sure. 

425
00:30:49,208 --> 00:30:50,375
Thank you. 

426
00:30:51,375 --> 00:30:53,333
But the army could've posted it too. 

427
00:30:53,875 --> 00:30:56,500
Our acquaintances found some letters in the records recently. 

428
00:30:56,583 --> 00:30:57,750
So we brought it. 

429
00:30:58,125 --> 00:30:59,791
We wanted to talk about some other things as well. 

430
00:31:00,041 --> 00:31:02,250
Can we meet you later? - Yes. 

431
00:31:04,208 --> 00:31:05,541
Where are you staying? 

432
00:31:05,625 --> 00:31:07,291
We'll find a hotel nearby. 

433
00:31:09,833 --> 00:31:11,750
On one hand you do such a huge favor on me. 

434
00:31:12,833 --> 00:31:15,041
On the other hand you don't even want to accept my gratitude. 

435
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:21,708
Jassi tell them, guests in our Punjab don't stay at hotels. 

436
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:24,041
Come home. 

437
00:31:25,541 --> 00:31:26,708
Come. Come. 

438
00:31:38,875 --> 00:31:40,083
This is the fifth one. No more. 

439
00:31:46,041 --> 00:31:50,500
Gyani ji says, son, while eating you shouldn't count. 

440
00:31:54,291 --> 00:31:56,625
Sons, here, have a glass of buttermilk. 

441
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:00,125
Everything will get digested. 

442
00:32:00,708 --> 00:32:02,333
Young man, you have some too. 

443
00:32:03,458 --> 00:32:06,166
Sons, when I was of your age. 

444
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:09,541
I used to eat 10 such parathas (Indian bread) just like that. 

445
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:11,791
Isn't it, Lajo? 

446
00:32:11,875 --> 00:32:15,083
Oh forget it, you. - Oh why should I forget it. 

447
00:32:15,916 --> 00:32:19,000
"Our Punjab oye." 

448
00:32:19,041 --> 00:32:21,708
"Our Punjab oye." 

449
00:32:21,791 --> 00:32:27,125
"On top of that corn bread and mustard goulash." 

450
00:32:27,208 --> 00:32:32,416
"When I sit in the field I look like a royalty." 

451
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:35,041
"Our Punjab oye." 

452
00:32:35,083 --> 00:32:37,541
"Our Punjab oye." 

453
00:32:38,583 --> 00:32:39,916
Grand Father. 

454
00:32:43,291 --> 00:32:44,500
Father. 

455
00:32:46,041 --> 00:32:47,291
Father. 

456
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,708
You're so old still you want to dance like that. 

457
00:32:56,791 --> 00:32:58,375
At least think of your age. 

458
00:32:58,708 --> 00:33:01,791
Lajo, I'm a martyr's father. 

459
00:33:02,708 --> 00:33:04,916
I won't be defeated by age or disease. 

460
00:33:06,666 --> 00:33:08,375
Jassi, go to sleep, son. 

461
00:33:08,458 --> 00:33:09,583
So soon? 

462
00:33:09,666 --> 00:33:11,375
If I give you one, you won't ask for more. Go. 

463
00:33:12,625 --> 00:33:14,041
Go to sleep, son. 

464
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:24,916
If you don't mind, can we take some pictures? 

465
00:33:27,375 --> 00:33:28,916
Yes. Why not? 

466
00:33:30,583 --> 00:33:33,708
Dear, I was thinking that this year... 

467
00:33:33,791 --> 00:33:36,333
...if we make a shed for the cows it will be good. 

468
00:33:36,416 --> 00:33:38,000
The poor child is trying. 

469
00:33:40,541 --> 00:33:42,333
Father, as soon as the installment of the tractor is paid... 

470
00:33:42,416 --> 00:33:44,041
...I'll collect money for the shed. 

471
00:33:45,541 --> 00:33:47,708
Jassi will be going to higher school next year. 

472
00:33:48,458 --> 00:33:52,333
I'm saving the pension money for that. 

473
00:33:53,625 --> 00:33:54,750
No problem, dear. 

474
00:33:55,041 --> 00:33:57,291
You always do the right thing. 

475
00:33:59,083 --> 00:34:00,875
You're the son of this family. 

476
00:34:09,333 --> 00:34:11,875
This grand father will give me a real bad stomach upset, pal. 

477
00:34:11,958 --> 00:34:13,708
Stomach is already upset, pal. 

478
00:34:16,083 --> 00:34:20,958
There will be a toilet here, right? - Definitely not. 

479
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,125
I'm certain we've to go to the fields in the morning. 

480
00:34:29,708 --> 00:34:31,000
Cheers - Cheers 

481
00:34:38,291 --> 00:34:39,541
You both are not asleep yet. 

482
00:34:42,916 --> 00:34:44,500
If you need anything... 

483
00:34:44,583 --> 00:34:45,916
No. We're fine. 

484
00:34:49,333 --> 00:34:52,875
I've a request if you don't mind. 

485
00:34:54,833 --> 00:34:57,250
Nobody at home is really educated. 

486
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:03,750
And I don't want Jassi to read it. 

487
00:35:06,333 --> 00:35:10,333
If you could read this letter for me... 

488
00:35:11,041 --> 00:35:12,208
Of course, Why not? 

489
00:35:20,958 --> 00:35:22,250
My dear Kuljeet... 

490
00:35:22,416 --> 00:35:23,583
I'm fine. 

491
00:35:24,208 --> 00:35:26,916
I hope you all are fine too. 

492
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,500
The weather is pleasant. 

493
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,625
Everyone is awaiting the glistening summer sunlight. 

494
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:37,708
The nights are too cold here. 

495
00:35:38,458 --> 00:35:41,333
But we manage to go through the nights with a born fire 

496
00:35:42,708 --> 00:35:44,208
The post is peaceful at the moment. 

497
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,541
But even rare firing and bombing keeps us alert. 

498
00:35:49,458 --> 00:35:52,041
Kuljeet, when I return home this time... 

499
00:35:52,125 --> 00:35:55,250
...I'll take you and Jassi on a trip. 

500
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,000
You know, a few days back I was posted... 

501
00:36:02,083 --> 00:36:03,958
...on a hill top near a river. 

502
00:36:05,041 --> 00:36:08,250
There along with my comrades I've learnt a way of fishing. 

503
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:12,791
Catching fish with your bare hands has a different charm all together. 

504
00:36:14,291 --> 00:36:19,958
Folding your pants and getting knee-deep into icy cold water. 

505
00:36:20,666 --> 00:36:22,500
In a few moments everything goes numb. 

506
00:36:23,916 --> 00:36:27,291
Then we put our hands into the freezing waters. 

507
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:30,958
You can't feel a thing except the slithering of... 

508
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,166
...a fish passing from in between your hands... 

509
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:35,166
...and with that your hands start to... 

510
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:37,041
...shake automatically, instantly you grab the fish. 

511
00:36:37,916 --> 00:36:40,083
I'll surely want to teach this technique to Jassi. 

512
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:46,916
I want to see you all real soon. 

513
00:36:47,166 --> 00:36:49,833
I keep hearing Jassi's laughter. 

514
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:54,083
Tell father we'll get him operated as soon as I'm back. 

515
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:56,083
That was already done last year. 

516
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,625
Didn't he write anything else? 

517
00:37:15,125 --> 00:37:21,833
Yes. - Kuljeet, I love you very much. 

518
00:37:22,208 --> 00:37:24,125
I miss you a lot. 

519
00:37:28,916 --> 00:37:32,541
That's why I want to reach you before this letter. 

520
00:37:35,708 --> 00:37:38,458
And I'll reach there for you. 

521
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:40,625
You take care of everyone. 

522
00:37:41,458 --> 00:37:42,875
Take care of yourself too. 

523
00:37:43,541 --> 00:37:47,041
Your Balkar Singh. AC 159838. 

524
00:38:18,708 --> 00:38:20,333
Sand praji, get up. 

525
00:38:20,958 --> 00:38:22,875
Nawab Saab, get up... fast. 

526
00:38:22,958 --> 00:38:25,291
Get up. The Villagers are here to meet you. 

527
00:38:27,333 --> 00:38:28,500
Get up fast. 

528
00:38:31,458 --> 00:38:32,708
Villagers? 

529
00:38:33,041 --> 00:38:34,625
It looks like the whole village is here. 

530
00:38:37,833 --> 00:38:39,000
Sand. 

531
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:53,958
They are not from the TV channel. 

532
00:38:54,041 --> 00:38:56,708
They are not from the TV channel. Listen to us too. 

533
00:38:56,791 --> 00:38:58,708
Hear us, brother. Let us meet them. - I can't let you meet them. 

534
00:38:59,833 --> 00:39:01,625
Uncle, please let us meet them. 

535
00:39:01,708 --> 00:39:02,958
Let us meet them. The TV crew is there. 

536
00:39:03,208 --> 00:39:05,708
Listen to us. They didn't let us meet you. 

537
00:39:06,291 --> 00:39:08,666
I said they're not TV crew. 

538
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:10,875
Son, are you a TV crew? 

539
00:39:11,625 --> 00:39:13,958
I'm just a cameraman. He's the director. 

540
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:17,541
Oh the director! Director's here! 

541
00:39:17,833 --> 00:39:22,041
Oh... son, so you're the TV crew. Come with me. 

542
00:39:22,125 --> 00:39:24,375
Sit here. Sit. - Come on. 

543
00:39:25,375 --> 00:39:28,250
Sit. You too sit here next to the director. 

544
00:39:28,333 --> 00:39:30,750
Sit. Sit. - Focus the camera here. 

545
00:39:30,833 --> 00:39:32,000
Come on, click a snap. 

546
00:39:32,083 --> 00:39:34,500
Is it live? Live? Here. 

547
00:39:34,583 --> 00:39:37,166
Son, there is serious water problem in our town. 

548
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:40,750
Wife, turn on the TV quickly. I'm on TV. 

549
00:39:40,833 --> 00:39:42,458
Everyone is watching, Everyone. 

550
00:39:43,125 --> 00:39:44,291
It's live. 

551
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:49,000
Greetings. Is everything fine in Canada? 

552
00:39:49,083 --> 00:39:53,083
Bansi, you've not sent my CD player. 

553
00:39:53,166 --> 00:39:56,125
Send a bottle of Black Label too. 

554
00:39:57,291 --> 00:39:59,583
And video games for Chhotu. 

555
00:39:59,666 --> 00:40:01,125
Brother, shoot me too. 

556
00:40:01,583 --> 00:40:07,333
Sir, tell your government to ban his liquor. - Wow! 

557
00:40:07,416 --> 00:40:08,958
Heard, father? 

558
00:40:09,458 --> 00:40:13,791
He drinks liquor during happiness and in sorrow. 

559
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:18,333
Now you say. 

560
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:21,625
Aunt, we just came to know about Balkar Singh. 

561
00:40:30,458 --> 00:40:33,416
Wife, I'll call later. 

562
00:40:36,708 --> 00:40:38,750
Ask me about Balkar Singh, sir. 

563
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,708
He was a friend of friends. 

564
00:40:41,791 --> 00:40:44,041
He single-handedly taught a lesson to the enemies. 

565
00:40:44,125 --> 00:40:46,208
Balkar Singh is the pride of our town. 

566
00:40:46,291 --> 00:40:51,125
No one in this town is as brave as our Balkar Singh, son. 

567
00:41:08,125 --> 00:41:10,708
Ok, sir. Greetings. 

568
00:41:14,041 --> 00:41:15,916
Bye. - Do come home. 

569
00:41:16,166 --> 00:41:19,666
We'll talk a lot about Balkar. 

570
00:41:20,791 --> 00:41:22,833
Come, brothers. - Greetings. 

571
00:41:47,708 --> 00:41:49,833
Son Jassi, the tractor is stuck. 

572
00:41:49,916 --> 00:41:51,291
I'll just get it out, mom. 

573
00:41:53,583 --> 00:41:55,125
Jassi, can we come too? 

574
00:41:55,583 --> 00:41:56,958
To get the tractor out? 

575
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,958
Yes. This bare-dude likes dare, dude. 

576
00:42:01,291 --> 00:42:02,416
Ok, come. 

577
00:42:03,541 --> 00:42:05,666
Hey Saand! Why you had to invite this trouble? 

578
00:42:05,833 --> 00:42:09,083
Nawaab Saab! Pull it otherwise I may get stuck. 

579
00:42:11,958 --> 00:42:14,875
Saand praji! - Yes. 

580
00:42:14,958 --> 00:42:17,500
'S' is for Superman, right? - Oh shut up 

581
00:42:17,583 --> 00:42:19,208
'S' for Saand (bull)! 

582
00:42:19,291 --> 00:42:22,291
Apply some more strength, try harder! - See this 

583
00:42:33,208 --> 00:42:37,750
Very good Saand. 'S' for Supermen? No 'S' for Saand. 

584
00:42:43,375 --> 00:42:48,000
Shit! Oh! - Forget it! 

585
00:43:13,083 --> 00:43:14,583
Now push! 

586
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:17,625
Come on Jassi! 

587
00:43:18,791 --> 00:43:20,916
Your tractor came out. 

588
00:43:23,666 --> 00:43:26,583
Jassi! Apply more strength! 

589
00:43:34,458 --> 00:43:36,916
Jassi, couldn't you tell us earlier... 

590
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,041
...We have to raise the plough of the tractor? 

591
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:41,000
I was testing. - What? 

592
00:43:41,250 --> 00:43:43,208
How strong is the bull! 

593
00:43:43,916 --> 00:43:45,166
Naughty you! 

594
00:44:17,041 --> 00:44:18,708
Hey Jassi, you are an expert. 

595
00:44:19,791 --> 00:44:20,916
Very good Saand, Saand. 

596
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,583
Saand, pull! - I am pulling! 

597
00:44:25,125 --> 00:44:26,541
Let it loose! Let it loose! 

598
00:44:26,625 --> 00:44:28,000
Why don't you do it? - No! 

599
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:29,333
Take it closer! 

600
00:44:29,416 --> 00:44:31,041
Should I? Here you are! 

601
00:44:31,125 --> 00:44:32,416
Come on! Saand! C'mon! 

602
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:33,625
Come on. 

603
00:44:33,833 --> 00:44:35,250
Cut it, cut it. 

604
00:44:38,875 --> 00:44:41,916
Jassi, you... 

605
00:44:42,458 --> 00:44:43,750
Got you! 

606
00:44:43,833 --> 00:44:45,208
Rascal, you're cheating! 

607
00:44:45,291 --> 00:44:46,500
First you ask me to take it closer and then you cut my kite! 

608
00:44:46,583 --> 00:44:47,708
I won't play with you! 

609
00:44:47,791 --> 00:44:48,916
You can't defeat me! 

610
00:44:49,041 --> 00:44:51,000
Wait! I'll get the kite back. 

611
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:04,541
Nawab saab, stop! That's Pakistan! 

612
00:45:16,125 --> 00:45:17,708
Can a border look like this too? 

613
00:45:23,041 --> 00:45:28,041
Hail Motherland! 

614
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,375
Saand, check it out, this is Pakistan buddy! 

615
00:45:39,125 --> 00:45:40,291
Saand, hurry, come fast! 

616
00:45:45,875 --> 00:45:50,250
What are you saying? It's unbelievable! Looks the same! 

617
00:45:53,583 --> 00:45:57,375
Jassi look, our fields and theirs are exactly the same! 

618
00:45:57,458 --> 00:45:59,000
It's not the same, praji (elder brother). 

619
00:46:00,916 --> 00:46:02,958
You see this barb wire separating them.. 

620
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,250
...Gyani ji (learned grand father) says... this makes us very different. 

621
00:46:11,541 --> 00:46:13,375
Jassi, will you take a photograph of ours? 

622
00:46:13,458 --> 00:46:14,583
Pass me the camera! 

623
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,958
Jassi, let me take one of yours. 

624
00:46:24,041 --> 00:46:25,500
No, I'm fine. 

625
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,416
Hey Jassi! Ever been across? 

626
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:37,333
No. Papa had gone and never came back. 

627
00:46:38,833 --> 00:46:42,875
But you shouldn't feel bad because he was doing his job. 

628
00:46:42,958 --> 00:46:44,083
And they were doing theirs. 

629
00:46:44,875 --> 00:46:46,291
That's what Gyani ji says. 

630
00:46:48,708 --> 00:46:49,916
Come on, once more! 

631
00:46:52,083 --> 00:46:56,833
Hey Jassi! Wait! How much will you run? I'll make a kite of you... 

632
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:17,250
Greetings, Mr. Gurjan Singh! 

633
00:47:17,333 --> 00:47:19,333
Greetings, aunt. - Greetings! 

634
00:47:19,916 --> 00:47:22,916
Greetings, contractor. - Is everything fine? 

635
00:47:23,708 --> 00:47:27,416
God is kind. How are you? - I'm fine. 

636
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:28,916
Greetings, contractor. 

637
00:47:29,333 --> 00:47:30,833
Greetings, Kuljeet. 

638
00:47:35,750 --> 00:47:37,541
Two installments of the tractor have not been paid. 

639
00:47:38,416 --> 00:47:40,333
I did whatever I could. 

640
00:47:40,958 --> 00:47:44,125
I have to answer to my superiors. - Contractor sir... - Dad! 

641
00:47:46,083 --> 00:47:49,083
Contractor sir, you won't have to answer to anyone. - Good. 

642
00:47:49,958 --> 00:47:51,166
I'll take your leave. 

643
00:47:54,625 --> 00:47:59,791
Dear, I think the cows can spend another monsoon without a shed. 

644
00:48:00,291 --> 00:48:01,666
Don't worry about it. 

645
00:48:02,083 --> 00:48:03,500
Listen! 

646
00:48:07,041 --> 00:48:09,083
I have a silver anklet. 

647
00:48:09,750 --> 00:48:12,041
It is of no use to me at this age. 

648
00:48:13,291 --> 00:48:17,458
I think we should sell it... - Mom! 

649
00:48:27,375 --> 00:48:30,166
Dad, don't you trust me? 

650
00:48:31,333 --> 00:48:32,458
My child! 

651
00:48:36,125 --> 00:48:38,500
I'll pay the installment with the money... 

652
00:48:38,958 --> 00:48:41,208
...I had saved for Jassi's schooling. 

653
00:48:43,416 --> 00:48:46,166
Neither will the cows get wet in monsoon nor... 

654
00:48:46,250 --> 00:48:47,833
...the silver bracelet be sold. 

655
00:48:50,416 --> 00:48:55,458
We'd rather better our today than be hopeful for a tomorrow. 

656
00:48:56,416 --> 00:49:02,500
Daughter, we never missed Balkar while you're with us. 

657
00:49:03,833 --> 00:49:05,000
God bless you. 

658
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:09,958
God bless you with all the happiness. 

659
00:49:11,458 --> 00:49:22,041
"Friend, this is our condition." 

660
00:49:22,666 --> 00:49:34,458
"We are fine." 

661
00:49:36,375 --> 00:49:37,625
"Praise the Lord." 

662
00:49:37,708 --> 00:49:40,833
Saand praji, papa and mom had met for the first time right here. 

663
00:49:41,041 --> 00:49:43,000
Papa used to come everyday to look at her. 

664
00:49:43,083 --> 00:49:45,083
And one day he spoke to her. 

665
00:50:11,083 --> 00:50:17,500
"I had asked for this wish." 

666
00:50:22,666 --> 00:50:29,458
"If I attain you, it will be heaven." 

667
00:50:34,208 --> 00:50:39,583
"I had asked for this wish." 

668
00:50:40,041 --> 00:50:45,666
"If I attain you, it will be heaven." 

669
00:50:46,250 --> 00:50:54,416
"If I attain you, it will be heaven." 

670
00:50:54,708 --> 00:51:00,416
"I have fallen in love for the first time." 

671
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:06,083
"Come into my heart as my beloved." 

672
00:51:06,166 --> 00:51:11,541
"I had asked for this wish." 

673
00:51:11,833 --> 00:51:18,208
"If I attain you, it will be heaven." 

674
00:51:21,125 --> 00:51:22,833
Through out the day boys are looking at her. 

675
00:51:22,916 --> 00:51:24,166
With how many of them will her brother fight? 

676
00:51:24,250 --> 00:51:27,416
The girl has young enough now. Think of her wedding! 

677
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:31,333
I was thinking... - I am young too! In two ways! 

678
00:51:35,291 --> 00:51:38,333
Hey. - Greetings aunt! - Father. 

679
00:51:38,416 --> 00:51:42,625
Long live my son! Long live! Where's Kuljeet? 

680
00:51:43,291 --> 00:51:47,041
I am sorry, son. I didn't recognize you! 

681
00:51:47,541 --> 00:51:49,583
Everyone knew me in the village... 

682
00:51:49,666 --> 00:51:51,708
...now they since I went to Taran Taaran no one seems to recognize me. 

683
00:51:52,416 --> 00:51:57,166
Never mind! I've come to marry your daughter, Kuljeet. 

684
00:51:58,041 --> 00:52:00,791
Who are you? You just barge into the house. 

685
00:52:01,166 --> 00:52:03,250
Hey, hey! I am not unknown. You know me. 

686
00:52:03,333 --> 00:52:05,208
I don't come to the Gurudwara (Punjabi temple) to see you! 

687
00:52:05,291 --> 00:52:07,958
Our story is even older than the Gurudwara! 

688
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,666
Hey you! - Just shut up! Sit down. 

689
00:52:14,916 --> 00:52:18,083
Look into your heart dear! You'll find me only! 

690
00:52:19,291 --> 00:52:23,291
Dad, the boy has gone mad! Anyway... 

691
00:52:23,750 --> 00:52:25,625
I have already selected my life partner. 

692
00:52:26,916 --> 00:52:33,541
Hey you! Another boy! Tell her, she'll marry me only! 

693
00:52:34,208 --> 00:52:38,166
Shut up and get lost! Oh! Kuljeet dear. Wait 

694
00:52:47,375 --> 00:52:49,750
I went to Taran Taaran and... 

695
00:52:50,041 --> 00:52:52,125
...the people back in village have all forgotten me! 

696
00:52:54,250 --> 00:52:55,416
Balkar. 

697
00:52:58,875 --> 00:53:01,041
Kuljeet, do you recognize him? 

698
00:53:10,875 --> 00:53:13,000
See this. 

699
00:53:15,208 --> 00:53:21,333
Do you remember I wore the uniform in Gurudwara. Let's talk. 

700
00:53:21,875 --> 00:53:23,250
Shall I take it as confirmed, uncle? 

701
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:37,666
Tell me. 

702
00:53:39,208 --> 00:53:40,625
Am I not handsome? 

703
00:53:46,208 --> 00:53:51,875
"Our love is accepted by God." 

704
00:53:51,958 --> 00:53:57,916
"Hence God has sent us to this world." 

705
00:54:02,916 --> 00:54:09,208
"Ask your father, how is the boy?" 

706
00:54:09,291 --> 00:54:14,666
"My father laughingly said the boy is very good." 

707
00:54:14,750 --> 00:54:20,083
"My heart aches for you." 

708
00:54:20,375 --> 00:54:26,458
"If I attain you, it will be heaven." 

709
00:54:26,625 --> 00:54:34,000
"If I attain you, it will be heaven." 

710
00:54:35,375 --> 00:54:41,000
"I have fallen in love for the first time." 

711
00:54:41,083 --> 00:54:46,750
"Come into my heart as my beloved." 

712
00:55:19,291 --> 00:55:22,750
Listen! I'll sacrifice many lives for you... 

713
00:55:23,916 --> 00:55:26,500
...but this life is for my country. 

714
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,291
Do you accept? 

715
00:55:29,041 --> 00:55:30,458
If you do then eat it. 

716
00:55:33,041 --> 00:55:34,458
Feed me too. 

717
00:55:41,916 --> 00:55:47,666
"If we get married soon." 

718
00:55:47,750 --> 00:55:53,458
"I want two boys next year." 

719
00:55:59,250 --> 00:56:04,875
"I am with you in your wishes." 

720
00:56:04,958 --> 00:56:10,375
"I will obey your orders." 

721
00:56:10,458 --> 00:56:16,125
"Now I am finally able to attain my wishes." 

722
00:56:16,208 --> 00:56:22,166
"If I attain you, it will be heaven." 

723
00:56:22,250 --> 00:56:29,958
"If I attain you, it will be heaven." 

724
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:36,750
"I have fallen in love for the first time." 

725
00:56:36,833 --> 00:56:43,041
"Come into my heart as my beloved." 

726
00:56:58,916 --> 00:57:00,375
What happened? 

727
00:57:02,791 --> 00:57:04,583
You've started throwing tantrums as soon as we are married! 

728
00:57:13,583 --> 00:57:15,083
Don't go! 

729
00:57:15,958 --> 00:57:17,791
I have to go. 

730
00:57:26,791 --> 00:57:28,500
What shall I name our child? 

731
00:57:29,208 --> 00:57:36,375
Jassi! If it's a girl, Jasmeet. If it's a boy, Jaswindar. 

732
00:57:37,875 --> 00:57:40,166
We'll call them both Jassi lovingly. 

733
00:57:42,750 --> 00:57:46,000
At least now give me a smile. C'mon, hurry! 

734
00:57:59,791 --> 00:58:01,333
May God take care of you! 

735
00:58:05,708 --> 00:58:10,250
'One day father went off like this; and only his memories returned.' 

736
00:58:10,333 --> 00:58:12,000
Today is the second day of our journey. 

737
00:58:12,125 --> 00:58:14,416
The answer to the question is true. 

738
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:16,583
One should not join the Indian army. 

739
00:58:16,666 --> 00:58:18,833
The truth is a soldier gets killed in a war. 

740
00:58:18,916 --> 00:58:22,333
And leaves behind a wife to face all the troubles, all alone 

741
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:25,333
Everyone wants to sacrifice something or the other. 

742
00:58:25,541 --> 00:58:26,708
But only for a while. 

743
00:58:27,708 --> 00:58:29,458
Because problems will never end. 

744
00:58:29,541 --> 00:58:31,000
Problems will recur. 

745
00:58:31,208 --> 00:58:32,958
Bigger and stronger! 

746
00:58:33,875 --> 00:58:35,833
Balkar Singh was not just a soldier. 

747
00:58:36,375 --> 00:58:39,625
He was also a son, a husband and a father. 

748
00:58:40,083 --> 00:58:41,291
Cut! 

749
00:58:46,666 --> 00:58:51,625
It's true Nawab saab, who will want to join the army for such a life? 

750
00:59:03,375 --> 00:59:04,500
Jassi! 

751
00:59:05,541 --> 00:59:06,666
What are you doing? 

752
00:59:06,750 --> 00:59:09,458
Saand praji, give me a hand. 

753
00:59:21,916 --> 00:59:23,000
Wait. 

754
00:59:49,041 --> 00:59:51,333
Saand praji, pick me up! 

755
01:00:01,125 --> 01:00:02,333
What are you doing? 

756
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:06,125
Papa's uniform was incomplete. I am completing it. 

757
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,208
I'll also join the army like my papa. 

758
01:00:22,416 --> 01:00:25,041
Then who will take care of your mother? 

759
01:00:25,125 --> 01:00:28,208
Mom takes care of everyone and will take care of herself too. 

760
01:00:28,916 --> 01:00:30,458
I'll take care of my country. 

761
01:00:31,125 --> 01:00:34,500
This is what papa used to say. And I believe that! 

762
01:00:39,208 --> 01:00:40,708
Jassi! 

763
01:00:41,291 --> 01:00:42,708
Go to sleep. 

764
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:46,666
You rest too. You have to set out early tomorrow morning. 

765
01:01:16,791 --> 01:01:22,708
The path you had taken, now your son is walking on the same path. 

766
01:01:26,375 --> 01:01:28,208
He wants to join the army. 

767
01:01:35,875 --> 01:01:37,708
I miss you a lot! 

768
01:01:43,250 --> 01:01:44,583
But it's ok. 

769
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:51,833
I am just proud to be your widow. 

770
01:02:02,250 --> 01:02:04,958
I would sacrifice a million lives for you. 

771
01:02:23,416 --> 01:02:25,750
Some snacks for the road. 

772
01:02:26,208 --> 01:02:27,833
No thanks. 

773
01:02:27,916 --> 01:02:31,000
Elders say, never refuse food. 

774
01:02:32,416 --> 01:02:34,166
Very good! 

775
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:35,833
Thank you, all of you. 

776
01:02:36,500 --> 01:02:39,000
Goodbye! - Goodbye! 

777
01:02:39,083 --> 01:02:40,416
Say goodbye to Jassi. 

778
01:02:41,041 --> 01:02:43,125
All right. Goodbye. 

779
01:02:58,041 --> 01:03:00,208
Saand praji, Nawab, stop! 

780
01:03:00,708 --> 01:03:03,083
Saand praji, Nawab, stop! 

781
01:03:03,166 --> 01:03:04,541
Stop! 

782
01:03:04,625 --> 01:03:07,000
Jassi? - Saand! Nawab! Stop. 

783
01:03:09,458 --> 01:03:10,958
Didn't you go to school? 

784
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,458
I know when to go to school and when not to. 

785
01:03:16,583 --> 01:03:17,875
This is for both of you. 

786
01:03:19,250 --> 01:03:20,583
Thank you. 

787
01:03:20,875 --> 01:03:23,416
Saand praji, this is for you. 

788
01:03:39,083 --> 01:03:40,666
And this is for you. 

789
01:03:47,458 --> 01:03:48,875
Take care. 

790
01:03:57,458 --> 01:03:58,666
Saand praji! 

791
01:03:58,750 --> 01:04:00,291
Jassi, what are you doing? 

792
01:04:00,583 --> 01:04:03,041
Saand praji, when your film is completed... 

793
01:04:03,125 --> 01:04:05,291
...fly this kite and cut it off. 

794
01:04:05,583 --> 01:04:09,875
It will reach me and I'll understand that your film is ready. 

795
01:04:10,041 --> 01:04:12,375
Sure! Bye! 

796
01:04:19,083 --> 01:04:20,500
Wish you a safe journey! 

797
01:04:26,041 --> 01:04:27,791
Which is our next destination? 

798
01:04:27,875 --> 01:04:30,250
Now we have left Punjab and are headed towards Manali. 

799
01:04:31,333 --> 01:04:32,916
Hey Saand! - What? 

800
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,541
Let's gargle or else we'll have a sore throat. 

801
01:04:35,625 --> 01:04:37,333
Okay, let's go. 

802
01:04:43,916 --> 01:04:46,875
Chhotu, two plates of tandoori chicken! Hurry up! 

803
01:04:57,541 --> 01:04:59,208
Hey Chhotu! Wait! Come here! 

804
01:04:59,541 --> 01:05:01,958
Did you wipe this plate with your underpants? - No! 

805
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,166
You're lying! Come here. 

806
01:05:03,666 --> 01:05:05,583
Stop it, Saand! Don't be disgusting! 

807
01:05:05,666 --> 01:05:06,916
Seriously! Smell this! - Take it away! 

808
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:08,833
Smell this! It's the same smell man! 

809
01:05:08,916 --> 01:05:10,000
Forget it! 

810
01:05:10,083 --> 01:05:11,708
Do one thing. Get another plate. 

811
01:05:13,291 --> 01:05:14,666
Go on! - Ok. 

812
01:05:17,458 --> 01:05:21,083
It was the same! - It's okay buddy. What else do you expect here? 

813
01:05:25,458 --> 01:05:28,250
Punjabi! 

814
01:05:37,250 --> 01:05:38,333
Yes! 

815
01:05:38,416 --> 01:05:39,750
Is it okay now? 

816
01:05:39,833 --> 01:05:41,166
Couldn't you do this before? 

817
01:05:42,583 --> 01:05:44,000
Serve me the chatni (Indian sauce)! 

818
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,500
Nawab Saab, it's divine! Let's start! 

819
01:06:00,291 --> 01:06:01,958
Do you mind not staring while I'm eating? 

820
01:06:02,208 --> 01:06:06,000
Call me if you need anything else. 

821
01:06:06,416 --> 01:06:07,583
Listen! 

822
01:06:08,083 --> 01:06:11,666
When you bring the rest of the food, clean the plates like this only. 

823
01:06:11,958 --> 01:06:13,125
All right. 

824
01:06:13,208 --> 01:06:14,916
Punjabi! 

825
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,083
Hey Chhotu! 

826
01:06:21,291 --> 01:06:22,416
Get the bill! 

827
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:23,833
Have some fennel seeds! 

828
01:06:27,916 --> 01:06:29,083
Here, pay the bill! 

829
01:06:29,333 --> 01:06:31,083
All right, give me the money. 

830
01:06:31,458 --> 01:06:34,125
Do you know this wallet had got wet in the fields? 

831
01:06:34,291 --> 01:06:35,833
I dried it with so much difficulty. 

832
01:06:41,333 --> 01:06:43,333
Didn't you dry the cash? 

833
01:06:45,250 --> 01:06:47,541
I had kept the wallet outside. 

834
01:06:47,708 --> 01:06:51,041
Chhotu, take the money from them. - Right away! 

835
01:06:55,208 --> 01:06:57,333
Welcome to spice! Damn it! 

836
01:07:06,083 --> 01:07:08,166
Let it go! Let it go... don't think. 

837
01:07:08,416 --> 01:07:13,041
Dear wife, I've brought a new Nokia. It also has games! 

838
01:07:13,333 --> 01:07:17,291
"We are free. But we are not alone." 

839
01:07:17,375 --> 01:07:21,291
"Everyone is jealous of us here." 

840
01:07:21,375 --> 01:07:23,291
"We just study." 

841
01:07:23,375 --> 01:07:29,583
"We fought with the problems. There are several like them." 

842
01:07:30,125 --> 01:07:34,083
"Our present is jolly." 

843
01:07:34,166 --> 01:07:36,000
"We rule our future." 

844
01:07:36,083 --> 01:07:39,125
"Hey, what do you say my friend?" 

845
01:07:39,375 --> 01:07:40,791
Where is my phone? 

846
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,208
Piya, will you do a favor? - Tell her to send money. 

847
01:07:46,750 --> 01:07:48,166
Nawab, green notes. 

848
01:07:48,875 --> 01:07:50,416
Come on! - Take this. 

849
01:07:58,416 --> 01:07:59,916
Day four... It's a beautiful day! 

850
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,666
"A liar gets bit by the crow." 

851
01:08:01,750 --> 01:08:03,458
It's a beautiful day! Oey Saand! 

852
01:08:10,208 --> 01:08:11,458
The second corner. 

853
01:08:11,750 --> 01:08:13,708
The next letter to an Airforce officer. 

854
01:08:15,208 --> 01:08:16,666
A letter for Mr. Vikram. 

855
01:08:16,875 --> 01:08:19,125
Have a seat. I'll give it to him. - Okay. 

856
01:08:32,166 --> 01:08:34,250
What a personality the guys got buddy! 

857
01:08:35,625 --> 01:08:36,833
Yes. 

858
01:09:00,041 --> 01:09:02,500
Squadron leader Vikram Shergill! - Sameer Suri Sir... 

859
01:09:03,625 --> 01:09:05,583
Ali! Nice to meet you, sir. 

860
01:09:05,666 --> 01:09:08,541
No, the pleasure is all mine. Let's have some drinks. 

861
01:09:08,625 --> 01:09:10,000
No sir. - Narayan! 

862
01:09:10,083 --> 01:09:11,583
Take their luggage into the house. 

863
01:09:15,083 --> 01:09:18,375
Narayan! One more chilled beer! 

864
01:09:19,416 --> 01:09:21,333
Remember, you'll always get chilled beer over here. 

865
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:25,166
Not just beer, you'll always get a drink here. 

866
01:09:25,875 --> 01:09:29,000
You were you talking about a movie, weren't you? 

867
01:09:29,083 --> 01:09:30,208
Yes sir. 

868
01:09:30,291 --> 01:09:32,208
We've set out to deliver three letters. 

869
01:09:32,291 --> 01:09:34,041
And we're also filming this experience. 

870
01:09:34,416 --> 01:09:37,083
That's good adventure and that's good at your age. 

871
01:09:38,208 --> 01:09:39,750
I was in the flying academy. 

872
01:09:40,166 --> 01:09:41,666
I still remember those days. 

873
01:09:42,375 --> 01:09:43,958
Touch down of the sorties to... 

874
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:47,041
...impress the daughter's of senior officers. 

875
01:09:47,125 --> 01:09:50,083
Must be hot! The chicks... 

876
01:09:50,166 --> 01:09:51,333
You bet! 

877
01:09:52,833 --> 01:09:54,541
And DJ was in the military academy. 

878
01:09:55,083 --> 01:09:57,541
He joined the army as soon as he passed out. 

879
01:09:58,750 --> 01:10:01,375
Narayan! Get the letter! 

880
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:06,666
Come on, bottoms up! Come on. 

881
01:10:09,875 --> 01:10:11,250
Take this away. 

882
01:10:17,541 --> 01:10:20,791
Sir, can I film this? 

883
01:10:23,958 --> 01:10:25,166
All right. 

884
01:10:29,416 --> 01:10:33,000
Dude, how are you? 

885
01:10:33,333 --> 01:10:35,083
I know it's a stupid question to ask about your health. 

886
01:10:35,333 --> 01:10:36,833
Who has the guts to harm you? 

887
01:10:37,333 --> 01:10:39,416
How stupid! Can anyone even touch me? 

888
01:10:41,750 --> 01:10:44,916
Can anyone even touch you? See! Except me. 

889
01:10:46,833 --> 01:10:49,416
The regiment is on high alert. The war is on. 

890
01:10:49,583 --> 01:10:50,916
War, dude. War! 

891
01:10:51,458 --> 01:10:52,833
Nobody wants a war. 

892
01:10:53,791 --> 01:10:57,041
But you know what an honor it is for a soldier... 

893
01:10:57,125 --> 01:10:59,041
...to be able do something for his country. 

894
01:11:01,125 --> 01:11:02,333
I know. 

895
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:05,500
It's gotten very cold up here. 

896
01:11:06,250 --> 01:11:08,166
The army has given us new shoes... 

897
01:11:08,375 --> 01:11:10,250
...but no bullet-proof jackets. 

898
01:11:11,458 --> 01:11:12,958
And you air-force officers... 

899
01:11:15,166 --> 01:11:18,041
We have jets, so we don't need bullet-proof jackets. 

900
01:11:18,125 --> 01:11:19,291
That's what he must have written. 

901
01:11:19,375 --> 01:11:20,708
Yes, listen. 

902
01:11:20,791 --> 01:11:23,750
You have jets right, you don't need bullet-proof jackets. 

903
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,958
Now he will compare the army and the air-force. Listen. 

904
01:11:27,625 --> 01:11:31,333
Accept it for once; soldiers are braver than air-force pilots. 

905
01:11:31,916 --> 01:11:33,833
We face the enemy directly. 

906
01:11:34,291 --> 01:11:37,666
And you do your fireworks from above and get away. 

907
01:11:37,875 --> 01:11:39,791
Who is braver? He or me? 

908
01:11:39,875 --> 01:11:41,000
You Sir! You! 

909
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:47,708
Do you think you can wear my t-shirt and become braver than me? 

910
01:11:47,791 --> 01:11:49,000
Who is braver? 

911
01:11:49,083 --> 01:11:50,250
You Sir! 

912
01:11:50,583 --> 01:11:52,166
We have to decide n find out. 

913
01:11:52,250 --> 01:11:53,916
Let's find out with an arm-wrestling match. 

914
01:11:54,041 --> 01:11:57,458
Accept it... You will not be able to win. Who will win? He or me? 

915
01:11:57,541 --> 01:11:58,916
You will sir! - You will! 

916
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:00,250
Who will win? He or me? 

917
01:12:00,333 --> 01:12:02,333
You will sir! - You will, of course! 

918
01:12:02,416 --> 01:12:04,000
Ready for an arm-wrestling match? 

919
01:12:04,083 --> 01:12:05,500
Come on! 

920
01:12:34,333 --> 01:12:38,041
I miss you. 

921
01:12:39,375 --> 01:12:44,541
Seldom. But I do. 

922
01:12:46,166 --> 01:12:51,625
This time either the letter will reach you or I will. 

923
01:12:53,625 --> 01:12:58,625
If I get there we will surely have an arm wrestling match. 

924
01:13:00,083 --> 01:13:01,666
And if I don't... 

925
01:13:04,666 --> 01:13:06,041
..You win! 

926
01:13:08,875 --> 01:13:10,250
Love DJ. 

927
01:13:20,791 --> 01:13:26,208
DJ. Captain Dhananjay Shergill, 18th grenadiers. 

928
01:13:26,791 --> 01:13:28,083
My younger brother. 

929
01:13:35,458 --> 01:13:38,333
Stay for some days. I would like that. 

930
01:13:54,833 --> 01:14:02,208
1, 2, 3, 4! 1, 2, 3, 4! 1, 2, 3, 4! 

931
01:14:02,291 --> 01:14:09,333
1, 2, 3, 4! 1, 2, 3, 4! 1, 2, 3, 4! 

932
01:14:09,416 --> 01:14:10,541
1,2... 

933
01:14:10,625 --> 01:14:11,708
Nawab Saab! 

934
01:14:11,791 --> 01:14:15,875
1, 2, 3, 4! 1, 2, 3, 4! 

935
01:14:15,958 --> 01:14:19,625
Check it out, looks like the squadron leader is preparing his own army. 

936
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,291
1,2,3,4! 

937
01:14:23,375 --> 01:14:26,666
1,2,3,4! 1, 2! 

938
01:14:26,750 --> 01:14:28,041
Good morning, sir. 

939
01:14:29,416 --> 01:14:30,750
Come on, join in! 

940
01:14:30,833 --> 01:14:33,125
No, no sir. We're fine here. 

941
01:14:33,708 --> 01:14:36,041
Narayan, coffee! - Yes sir. 

942
01:14:36,125 --> 01:14:39,125
1, 2, 3, 4! 1, 2! 

943
01:14:39,208 --> 01:14:40,500
Good training, sir. 

944
01:14:42,708 --> 01:14:44,000
But why all this? 

945
01:14:44,125 --> 01:14:46,208
I want to make them strong and tough like me. 

946
01:14:46,416 --> 01:14:49,750
Sir, can I ask you a personal question? 

947
01:14:51,125 --> 01:14:52,291
How personal question? 

948
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,083
Sir, how did this happen? 

949
01:14:57,541 --> 01:15:00,291
Ha, Is that a personal question? 

950
01:15:02,083 --> 01:15:03,291
Aerial combat! 

951
01:15:04,125 --> 01:15:05,333
Flight engaged! 

952
01:15:06,208 --> 01:15:07,416
Gunfire from both sides! 

953
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:10,583
I shot down two planes! 

954
01:15:10,916 --> 01:15:12,625
One shot hit my engine. 

955
01:15:12,833 --> 01:15:14,666
I was flying my plane on one engine. 

956
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:16,791
I didn't realize when it stopped. 

957
01:15:17,250 --> 01:15:19,375
I could only see the enemy! 

958
01:15:19,875 --> 01:15:22,583
Bang! Crashed! 

959
01:15:24,375 --> 01:15:27,041
I woke up in an air-force hospital. 

960
01:15:28,500 --> 01:15:30,916
The doctors told, we have a special vehicle for you! 

961
01:15:31,333 --> 01:15:32,583
Here! 

962
01:15:35,083 --> 01:15:36,541
I have no regrets. 

963
01:15:38,750 --> 01:15:40,625
My whole family has served the country. 

964
01:15:41,708 --> 01:15:44,791
From my great grand fathers to DJ. 

965
01:15:44,875 --> 01:15:46,666
Don't you hate the enemy? 

966
01:15:47,250 --> 01:15:51,000
Hate? That's a very big word? 

967
01:15:52,291 --> 01:15:55,458
We are taught to serve, protect and defend the country. 

968
01:15:56,708 --> 01:15:57,958
That's our job. 

969
01:15:58,750 --> 01:16:02,000
The Enemy is doing their job, we do ours. 

970
01:16:02,541 --> 01:16:06,208
We shouldn't feel bad as father was doing his job there... 

971
01:16:06,708 --> 01:16:07,958
...and they were doing theirs. 

972
01:16:08,333 --> 01:16:11,041
Imagine, one day you set out for college. 

973
01:16:12,041 --> 01:16:13,208
You look at each other n with a... 

974
01:16:13,291 --> 01:16:14,750
...gesture are walking towards each other. Bang! 

975
01:16:15,708 --> 01:16:17,083
A bus smashes you away! 

976
01:16:18,458 --> 01:16:19,625
What's the use? 

977
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,333
You lose your life for nothing. 

978
01:16:24,541 --> 01:16:25,750
This is better. 

979
01:16:26,333 --> 01:16:29,791
Sir, you think, to be a soldier is a way of life. 

980
01:16:30,583 --> 01:16:32,958
And it is better if you are killed in a battle field. 

981
01:16:33,375 --> 01:16:34,541
No. 

982
01:16:36,666 --> 01:16:39,875
If you do something for your country, that is better. 

983
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:54,166
Pick this up soil. 

984
01:16:56,583 --> 01:16:57,791
Pick this. 

985
01:17:02,916 --> 01:17:04,041
Feel it! 

986
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:10,541
We are all made of this soil. 

987
01:17:11,500 --> 01:17:12,750
This is our mother. 

988
01:17:13,375 --> 01:17:14,666
Our identity. 

989
01:17:15,708 --> 01:17:17,166
There's no difference between... 

990
01:17:17,250 --> 01:17:19,500
...a soldier and a common man if they love this soil. 

991
01:17:20,708 --> 01:17:23,208
And to love our motherland doesn't mean... 

992
01:17:23,291 --> 01:17:24,625
...we should die in a battle. 

993
01:17:25,541 --> 01:17:28,500
But to do anything for the progress of our country. 

994
01:17:29,666 --> 01:17:32,583
And not everyone gets that chance. 

995
01:17:33,458 --> 01:17:35,000
I'm not fighting a battle here. 

996
01:17:35,583 --> 01:17:37,791
Neither am I preparing these children for battle. 

997
01:17:38,208 --> 01:17:41,625
I'm doing only what I can do right now. 

998
01:17:43,041 --> 01:17:44,166
For our motherland... 

999
01:17:48,333 --> 01:17:51,208
You don't need medals on your shoulder to serve your country. 

1000
01:17:51,666 --> 01:17:52,750
Cut it! 

1001
01:17:52,833 --> 01:17:54,458
How was my acting? 

1002
01:17:54,875 --> 01:17:56,375
Enough of this lecture. 

1003
01:17:56,875 --> 01:17:59,833
Come live my life with me and then you can decide for your selves. 

1004
01:18:00,083 --> 01:18:03,666
Whether your childishness is better or my obsession. 

1005
01:18:09,916 --> 01:18:12,250
I want one double on the rocks and beer for the boys. 

1006
01:18:12,333 --> 01:18:15,583
Sir, I will also have rum today. 

1007
01:18:15,833 --> 01:18:18,583
Oh yeah! The kid is growing up. 

1008
01:18:21,041 --> 01:18:24,875
Make it three doubles... - If he can drink it, so can I. 

1009
01:18:25,750 --> 01:18:26,916
Okay! 

1010
01:18:28,125 --> 01:18:29,458
Hi honey! 

1011
01:18:33,208 --> 01:18:35,666
Throw all your dirty thoughts out of your mind! 

1012
01:18:37,041 --> 01:18:38,291
She's my girlfriend. 

1013
01:18:50,500 --> 01:18:52,166
How have you been? - Very good! 

1014
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,583
Sammy! - Sammy! - Hi 

1015
01:18:55,666 --> 01:18:57,083
Ali! - Hi! 

1016
01:18:57,916 --> 01:18:59,208
I missed you, honey! 

1017
01:19:01,458 --> 01:19:02,625
So, where are you guys from? 

1018
01:19:02,708 --> 01:19:05,541
Actually we are from Indore. Basically we are students. 

1019
01:19:05,875 --> 01:19:07,750
We are here to make a film for our graduation. 

1020
01:19:08,083 --> 01:19:10,416
I am Sammy. - Vikram Shergill. 

1021
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:12,083
Can I dance with the lady? - Sure. 

1022
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:14,208
Saloni. 

1023
01:19:16,541 --> 01:19:18,666
Hands up. Everybody hands up. 

1024
01:19:18,750 --> 01:19:21,791
Looks like tonight I'm getting lucky. 

1025
01:19:25,833 --> 01:19:27,125
Why are you looking like that? 

1026
01:19:28,833 --> 01:19:31,000
Above the knees, everything works just fine. 

1027
01:19:32,500 --> 01:19:34,041
Everybody hands up.

01:19:34,125 --> 01:19:36,041

Dance. Only Dance. 

1032
01:19:42,375 --> 01:19:44,541
When you hear music, are you put hands up! 

1033
01:19:44,625 --> 01:19:46,708
Are you put hands up! Are you put hands up! 

1034
01:19:46,791 --> 01:19:48,916
Everybody Number one Putting hands up. 

1035

You want to touch? Then dance with me. 

1045

You see, I know everything. 

1046
01:20:36,083 --> 01:20:39,333
Rock-n-roll, Bhangra, Mambo, everything. 

1047
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,833
Call all the friends you have. 

1048
01:20:50,916 --> 01:20:54,041
And yes. Tell them to come together. 

1049
01:20:54,541 --> 01:20:57,291
If they come one by one, they'll get beaten up to pulp. 

1050
01:21:40,916 --> 01:21:42,083
Sir. 

1051
01:21:42,458 --> 01:21:43,625
Stop! 

1052
01:21:45,916 --> 01:21:47,666
Back off! - Come on. Yeah. - Come on. 

1053
01:21:47,750 --> 01:21:49,208
Get up! - Get up! 

1054
01:21:57,333 --> 01:21:59,916
Get up! Get up! 

1055
01:22:00,416 --> 01:22:02,583
Get up! Get up! Come on. 

1056
01:22:04,208 --> 01:22:05,333
Kill him. 

1057
01:24:38,958 --> 01:24:41,291
Squadron leader, Vikram Shergill. 

1058
01:24:42,541 --> 01:24:43,750
Sir. 

1059
01:24:44,875 --> 01:24:46,791
I've to confess to you. 

1060
01:24:49,833 --> 01:24:51,875
Don't say anything about his girlfriend. 

1061
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:54,250
Nawab Saab. 

1062
01:24:54,333 --> 01:24:57,291
Confession lightens up the heart. 

1063
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:02,500
Sir, I can't do what you can. 

1064
01:25:16,666 --> 01:25:18,291
Best shot! Best shot! 

1065
01:25:19,166 --> 01:25:20,708
Best shot! Best shot! 

1066
01:25:20,875 --> 01:25:22,375
Best shot! Best shot! 

1067
01:26:50,416 --> 01:26:52,000
Damn, these legs. 

1068
01:26:52,416 --> 01:26:57,041
Can't face action. If I had these, I would've been up there. 

1069
01:26:58,916 --> 01:27:03,166
Sameer, I can't do... 

1070
01:27:05,416 --> 01:27:07,000
...what you can. 

1071
01:27:25,041 --> 01:27:27,500
Ok. So tell me is your childishness better... 

1072
01:27:27,583 --> 01:27:28,708
...or my obsession? 

1073
01:27:29,208 --> 01:27:31,333
Sir, how was DJ as a person? 

1074
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:34,250
He was stronger than me. 

1075
01:27:34,541 --> 01:27:36,666
C'mon. C'mon. C'mon. 

1076
01:27:37,583 --> 01:27:39,958
C'mon, Sir! C'mon. 

1077
01:27:43,375 --> 01:27:46,750
C'mon. Shergill. C'mon. C'mon. 

1078
01:27:51,083 --> 01:27:52,875
Shergill, nobody can defeat you. 

1079
01:27:52,958 --> 01:27:55,083
You've already decided without even competing. 

1080
01:28:08,500 --> 01:28:10,750
Everyone is a king in their own territory. 

1081
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:12,750
Lieutenant Dhananjay Shergill. 

1082
01:28:12,833 --> 01:28:15,625
Captain. Captain Dhananjay Shergill 

1083
01:28:15,708 --> 01:28:16,875
Sorry, captain. 

1084
01:28:17,500 --> 01:28:18,708
So, shall we? 

1085
01:28:25,500 --> 01:28:26,833
Brother, you'll lose again. C'mon, Vikram. 

1086
01:28:26,916 --> 01:28:29,250
Boasting can't make anyone brave. 

1087
01:28:29,333 --> 01:28:31,000
This is an army-man's hand. 

1088
01:28:31,041 --> 01:28:32,416
And this is air-force pilot's hand. 

1089
01:28:53,250 --> 01:28:56,125
Congratulations on your promotion. - Thank you, brother. 

1090
01:28:56,208 --> 01:28:57,541
Are you flying with us? 

1091
01:28:57,625 --> 01:28:59,541
You mean you're flying us down. 

1092
01:29:00,666 --> 01:29:02,500
Which ever way you look at it, it doesn't make any difference? 

1093
01:29:23,791 --> 01:29:29,000
"Rock yourself... Chat a little about love." 

1094
01:29:33,375 --> 01:29:38,333
"Rock yourself... Chat a little about love." 

1095
01:29:38,416 --> 01:29:43,166
"Take this daring, you may get settled in life." 

1096
01:29:43,250 --> 01:29:46,583
"Girls fall for this attitude." 

1097
01:29:48,125 --> 01:29:53,166
"They call me love guru, so let's dance." 

1098
01:29:53,250 --> 01:29:58,416
"I am a passionate lover. Taste my love." 

1099
01:29:58,500 --> 01:30:03,041
"I am a passionate lover. Taste my love." 

1100
01:30:03,125 --> 01:30:05,416
"I am a passionate lover." 

1101
01:30:05,500 --> 01:30:08,083
"Taste my love." 

1102
01:30:08,166 --> 01:30:13,333
"I am a passionate lover. Taste my love." 

1103
01:30:23,166 --> 01:30:28,041
"Entrust your youth to me." 

1104
01:30:28,416 --> 01:30:32,625
"Exchange your heart with mine." 

1105
01:30:32,708 --> 01:30:37,333
"Come on, let's party, party baby. Let's hit the floor." 

1106
01:30:37,416 --> 01:30:42,583
"Come on, let's party, party baby. Let's hit the floor." 

1107
01:30:42,666 --> 01:30:47,500
"So many crazy like them..." 

1108
01:30:47,583 --> 01:30:52,666
"...are moving around me. With God's grace, do your best." 

1109
01:30:52,750 --> 01:30:57,791
"I am a passionate lover." 

1110
01:30:57,875 --> 01:31:00,666
"I am a passionate lover..." 

1111
01:31:00,750 --> 01:31:01,958
"...taste my love." 

1112
01:31:02,833 --> 01:31:07,666
"I am a passionate lover. Taste my love." 

1113
01:31:07,750 --> 01:31:12,791
"I am a passionate lover. Taste my love." 

1114
01:31:22,791 --> 01:31:27,500
"You've right over my life." 

1115
01:31:27,833 --> 01:31:31,875
"This is my promise to you." 

1116
01:31:31,958 --> 01:31:36,750
"Come on, let's party, party baby. Let's hit the floor." 

1117
01:31:36,833 --> 01:31:42,000
"Come on, let's party, party baby. Let's hit the floor." 

1118
01:31:42,041 --> 01:31:46,875
"My heart has bowled over you." 

1119
01:31:46,958 --> 01:31:52,083
"Since I fell in love with you, so, let's dace, baby." 

1120
01:31:52,166 --> 01:31:57,041
"I am passionate lover... just taste my love." 

1121
01:31:57,125 --> 01:32:01,250
"I am passionate lover..." 

1122
01:32:02,083 --> 01:32:06,958
"I am passionate lover... just taste my love." 

1123
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:11,916
"I am passionate lover... just taste my love." 

1124
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:16,875
"I am passionate lover... just taste my love." 

1125
01:32:16,958 --> 01:32:21,958
"I am passionate lover... just taste my love." 

1126
01:32:57,166 --> 01:33:02,541
"My country is the most beautiful amongst all the nations." 

1127
01:33:07,041 --> 01:33:11,625
"My country is the most beautiful amongst all the nations." 

1128
01:33:11,708 --> 01:33:16,708
"If anybody tries to create enmity or hurt us... 

1129
01:33:16,791 --> 01:33:19,166
...just give him one tight slap." 

1130
01:33:19,250 --> 01:33:24,333
"My India is the best!" 

1131
01:33:24,416 --> 01:33:29,125
"It's the pride of the world." 

1132
01:33:29,208 --> 01:33:34,166
"My India is the best!" 

1133
01:33:34,250 --> 01:33:39,041
"It's the pride of the world." 

1134
01:33:39,125 --> 01:33:44,083
"My India is the best!" 

1135
01:33:44,166 --> 01:33:49,333
"It's the pride of the world." 

1136
01:33:56,791 --> 01:33:57,916
Excuse me, sir. 

1137
01:33:59,166 --> 01:34:00,291
Yes, officer. 

1138
01:34:00,375 --> 01:34:03,916
Can I embrace my brother before entering the battlefield? 

1139
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:14,083
So u see, brother? 

1140
01:34:14,166 --> 01:34:16,125
Today army will again face the action before the air-force. 

1141
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,583
Now tell me, who is more courageous? 

1142
01:34:20,041 --> 01:34:21,583
Both enter the battlefield anyway. 

1143
01:34:22,541 --> 01:34:24,750
But it takes more courage to drop the army.. 

1144
01:34:24,833 --> 01:34:27,625
..into the battlefield and then to bring them back... 

1145
01:34:28,125 --> 01:34:30,833
Because sometimes we have to bring them back dead. 

1146
01:34:31,333 --> 01:34:32,458
You're right, brother. 

1147
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:34,875
It's not about the army or the air-force... 

1148
01:34:35,125 --> 01:34:36,458
...but it's really about our nation. 

1149
01:34:36,708 --> 01:34:38,083
Our country. 

1150
01:34:39,583 --> 01:34:41,583
And I want you to bring me back. 

1151
01:34:42,041 --> 01:34:43,416
Dead or alive. 

1152
01:34:47,041 --> 01:34:48,166
That's your job, sir. 

1153
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:56,583
Make it straight for once, atleast. 

1154
01:35:40,500 --> 01:35:42,375
Brother, make it straight for once, atleast. 

1155
01:35:51,083 --> 01:35:52,291
Shergill. 

1156
01:35:56,958 --> 01:35:58,666
Will you fly the next batch too? 

1157
01:35:58,833 --> 01:36:00,250
That's my job, sir. 

1158
01:36:00,750 --> 01:36:02,375
I'm very sorry about your brother. 

1159
01:36:02,750 --> 01:36:03,833
I'm really sorry. 

1160
01:36:03,916 --> 01:36:06,083
Don't be. I'm not. 

1161
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:11,125
I'm not sorry about my brother. I'm proud of him. 

1162
01:36:11,958 --> 01:36:13,083
Even today. 

1163
01:36:14,375 --> 01:36:18,125
And with this pride I can spend my entire life happily. 

1164
01:36:19,958 --> 01:36:21,916
Nothing is greater than pride. Pride above all else 

1165
01:36:24,125 --> 01:36:28,958
He surpassed me in the fight for martyrdom. 

1166
01:36:33,041 --> 01:36:37,000
Now you tell me, who is stronger? 

1167
01:36:37,958 --> 01:36:39,083
He or I? 

1168
01:36:43,958 --> 01:36:45,041
You, sir you. 

1169
01:36:47,625 --> 01:36:49,958
Of course, I am. Me. 

1170
01:36:51,375 --> 01:36:54,083
Sir, but you certainly miss your brother? 

1171
01:36:56,416 --> 01:36:59,500
You're returning tomorrow? - Yes. 

1172
01:37:00,791 --> 01:37:04,333
Remember... you'll always get chilled beer here. 

1173
01:37:32,041 --> 01:37:35,416
Nawab Saab, this squadron leader Vikram Shergill... 

1174
01:37:35,500 --> 01:37:37,416
. is really a strange person... 

1175
01:37:39,375 --> 01:37:42,375
His brother is dead. He lost his legs. 

1176
01:37:43,208 --> 01:37:46,291
He lives alone, but still says he's happy. 

1177
01:37:52,583 --> 01:37:54,958
Yes. He's happy. 

1178
01:37:55,916 --> 01:37:57,125
Living with pride. 

1179
01:37:57,208 --> 01:37:58,583
What kind of pride, pal? 

1180
01:37:58,875 --> 01:38:00,333
Is this pride greater than life? 

1181
01:38:01,833 --> 01:38:05,125
Do you think a small word can just negate the feeling of pain? 

1182
01:38:13,958 --> 01:38:17,291
Day 6. We've covered our second destination. 

1183
01:38:17,875 --> 01:38:20,250
Saw Vikram Shergill's self decorated world. 

1184
01:38:21,291 --> 01:38:24,666
Squadron leader is in pain, but refuses to acknowledge it. 

1185
01:38:25,416 --> 01:38:27,666
The same question and the same answer. 

1186
01:38:28,041 --> 01:38:29,208
It's true. 

1187
01:38:29,708 --> 01:38:31,500
One shouldn't join the defense forces. 

1188
01:38:31,875 --> 01:38:34,333
One shouldn't join the defense forces. 

1189
01:38:34,500 --> 01:38:35,791
Is anyone there? 

1190
01:38:35,875 --> 01:38:37,125
Will anyone come? 

1191
01:38:37,208 --> 01:38:38,541
They've come. - What? 

1192
01:38:43,291 --> 01:38:44,458
They've come, Saand. 

1193
01:39:04,875 --> 01:39:09,625
Lift... - Please. Please. 

1194
01:39:12,208 --> 01:39:13,375
What happened? 

1195
01:39:13,458 --> 01:39:14,625
Your vehicle broke down. 

1196
01:39:14,708 --> 01:39:17,000
We're out of petrol. - Petrol. - Yes. 

1197
01:39:18,416 --> 01:39:21,541
No problem. Do one thing. Load it in the back of the vehicle. Come. 

1198
01:39:21,625 --> 01:39:23,541
C'mon. - Say thank you at least! 

1199
01:39:24,291 --> 01:39:25,750
Where are you going? 

1200
01:39:26,041 --> 01:39:27,291
To the airways. 

1201
01:39:27,458 --> 01:39:29,500
We've to go to the headquarters. 

1202
01:39:29,958 --> 01:39:31,416
Sir, forget him. 

1203
01:39:31,500 --> 01:39:33,083
Tell me about your self what are you carrying along behind? 

1204
01:39:33,166 --> 01:39:36,666
Guns, ammunitions, rocket-launchers, Bofors, explosives, ha? 

1205
01:39:38,041 --> 01:39:39,500
They're Soldiers, sir. 

1206
01:39:39,583 --> 01:39:40,708
Soldiers! 

1207
01:39:40,791 --> 01:39:42,000
Good morning. 

1208
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:50,583
Got a jolt, right sir? 

1209
01:39:54,708 --> 01:39:56,000
It's all right... 

1210
01:39:57,083 --> 01:39:58,833
Here, soldiers don't die. 

1211
01:39:59,541 --> 01:40:02,791
They either return as victors or martyrs. 

1212
01:40:03,791 --> 01:40:05,791
'Saffron, white and green.' 

1213
01:40:06,833 --> 01:40:08,458
'this is my life-cycle.' 

1214
01:40:09,541 --> 01:40:11,708
'Deeds, truth and motherland!' 

1215
01:40:12,375 --> 01:40:14,000
'It's what's brought me up.' 

1216
01:40:15,250 --> 01:40:16,708
'I was born patriotic.' 

1217
01:40:17,750 --> 01:40:19,208
'I I'll walk patriotic.' 

1218
01:40:20,041 --> 01:40:24,000
'I will live patriotic, and I will die patriotic.' 

1219
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:26,625
'Saffron, white and green.' 

1220
01:40:27,375 --> 01:40:29,125
' this is my life-cycle.' 

1221
01:40:29,541 --> 01:40:30,791
Respected sir. 

1222
01:40:31,458 --> 01:40:34,458
'I'm writing this letter to apply for a leave.' 

1223
01:40:35,041 --> 01:40:38,875
'Sir, my regiment is waiting at the base for the last 1 month.' 

1224
01:40:39,208 --> 01:40:41,083
'lf I could just get a 2 day leave, I would be able to complete 

1225
01:40:41,166 --> 01:40:43,375
...' a very important job back home. 

1226
01:40:44,208 --> 01:40:47,541
' Kind Sir, with great hope and expectation. 

1227
01:40:47,916 --> 01:40:49,750
' I'm requesting you to grant me this leave. 

1228
01:40:50,041 --> 01:40:52,375
'I've already given my leave application to my unit.' 

1229
01:40:52,958 --> 01:40:54,625
'This is my first and last request.' 

1230
01:40:54,708 --> 01:40:56,833
'After which I will never bother you again.' 

1231
01:40:57,666 --> 01:40:58,791
'Thanking you.' 

1232
01:40:58,875 --> 01:41:00,083
'Lieutenant Sahil Naqvi.' 

1233
01:41:00,166 --> 01:41:01,833
'12 Jet Light Infantry.' 

1234
01:41:02,375 --> 01:41:04,083
Who is this lieutenant Sahil Naqvi? 

1235
01:41:04,791 --> 01:41:07,041
6th April. 1999. 

1236
01:41:07,416 --> 01:41:08,916
This is 3 years old. 

1237
01:41:09,083 --> 01:41:10,750
At that time I wasn't the colonel of this regiment. 

1238
01:41:18,416 --> 01:41:20,583
Get me lieutenant Sahil Naqvi's file. 

1239
01:41:20,791 --> 01:41:23,000
12 Jet light. - Yes, sir. 

1240
01:41:25,666 --> 01:41:29,208
Sir, don't you think it was important for him to have this leave? 

1241
01:41:29,291 --> 01:41:30,791
Nothing is more important than the country. 

1242
01:41:30,875 --> 01:41:34,250
And for a soldier no other reason is greater than war. 

1243
01:41:34,625 --> 01:41:36,000
Is war a reason? 

1244
01:41:36,208 --> 01:41:37,458
Pardon me, sir. 

1245
01:41:37,541 --> 01:41:40,583
But If he had been granted that leave, he would've been alive today. 

1246
01:41:40,666 --> 01:41:42,041
Then someone else would have been martyred. 

1247
01:41:42,458 --> 01:41:46,000
If every request gets granted, then who is going fight the war? 

1248
01:41:46,083 --> 01:41:47,375
Common man? 

1249
01:42:03,250 --> 01:42:04,666
Why wasn't this posted? 

1250
01:42:05,166 --> 01:42:06,666
Send it to his home. - Yes Sir. 

1251
01:42:06,750 --> 01:42:07,916
Excuse me, sir. 

1252
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:11,041
If you don't mind, can we deliver this letter? 

1253
01:42:11,375 --> 01:42:13,958
We don't make exemptions in the rules of the army. 

1254
01:42:14,625 --> 01:42:15,958
Not even for martyrs? 

1255
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,250
Nawab Saab, why would you care buddy? 

1256
01:42:32,458 --> 01:42:34,583
It's their job. Let them do it. 

1257
01:42:35,166 --> 01:42:38,041
We're here to make the film, pal. It's the last shot. 

1258
01:42:38,125 --> 01:42:39,291
Let's complete it and return home, buddy. 

1259
01:42:39,375 --> 01:42:40,541
No, Sammy. 

1260
01:42:40,833 --> 01:42:42,583
I'm going to complete an unfulfilled dream. 

1261
01:42:44,083 --> 01:42:45,708
And this is greater than our film. 

1262
01:43:19,541 --> 01:43:20,666
Hello. 

1263
01:43:21,041 --> 01:43:22,125
Yes? 

1264
01:43:22,208 --> 01:43:25,000
Mrs. Naqvi? - Yes. Tell me. 

1265
01:43:25,416 --> 01:43:28,125
Ma'am, we've come to deliver this envelope to you. 

1266
01:43:36,875 --> 01:43:38,000
Oh! 

1267
01:43:38,250 --> 01:43:39,958
This is written by Sahil. 

1268
01:43:41,083 --> 01:43:42,250
How wonderful! 

1269
01:43:43,041 --> 01:43:45,875
Mrs. Naqvi. - One moment, Mrs. Deoji. 

1270
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:49,000
Please come. Please come, son. 

1271
01:43:49,375 --> 01:43:50,541
Join us. 

1272
01:44:06,583 --> 01:44:07,791
What will you have, son? 

1273
01:44:09,291 --> 01:44:12,125
Tea or Coffee? - Coffee. 

1274
01:44:13,291 --> 01:44:15,125
Dondu, give them 2 coffees. 

1275
01:44:15,208 --> 01:44:16,375
I'll be back. 

1276
01:44:17,208 --> 01:44:20,000
Saand, who can be Dr. Naqvi from them? 

1277
01:44:24,166 --> 01:44:25,791
Try one of these Mrs. Deoji - Yes. 

1278
01:44:27,666 --> 01:44:28,833
Ali, let's go. 

1279
01:44:29,500 --> 01:44:30,666
What? 

1280
01:44:31,041 --> 01:44:33,333
You've given the card, right? Fulfilled your dream? 

1281
01:44:33,875 --> 01:44:35,041
It's lying there in one corner. 

1282
01:44:36,583 --> 01:44:37,708
Come on. 

1283
01:44:40,041 --> 01:44:42,458
What happened, son? You're going? 

1284
01:44:43,166 --> 01:44:46,833
I've not even asked you yet, where you got this card from. 

1285
01:44:48,166 --> 01:44:49,625
It seems you don't have any free time for that. 

1286
01:44:53,333 --> 01:44:56,791
We came here thinking that this card would mean a lot to you. 

1287
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:58,583
But, where do you have the time... 

1288
01:44:58,666 --> 01:45:01,166
...you're busy with tea, coffee and Mrs. Deoji. 

1289
01:45:01,666 --> 01:45:05,333
Sammy. - Mrs. Naqvi, do you know... 

1290
01:45:05,416 --> 01:45:07,166
your son's last letter was not written to you, 

1291
01:45:07,541 --> 01:45:09,083
but was to his officer in - charge? 

1292
01:45:09,500 --> 01:45:10,708
For a leave. 

1293
01:45:13,666 --> 01:45:17,291
He wanted to return home using the excuse... 

1294
01:45:17,375 --> 01:45:19,000
of having some urgent work at home... 

1295
01:45:20,041 --> 01:45:21,833
He wanted to run away from war. 

1296
01:45:22,875 --> 01:45:24,875
Then what was the need to join the army? 

1297
01:45:25,500 --> 01:45:27,708
It is your fault. You should've stopped him. 

1298
01:45:31,333 --> 01:45:32,708
This is not true. 

1299
01:45:36,625 --> 01:45:38,416
I want to show you both something. 

1300
01:45:42,791 --> 01:45:44,041
'Hi, mom! Hi dad! ' 

1301
01:45:45,458 --> 01:45:47,541
'Wish you both a very happy wedding anniversary.' 

1302
01:45:47,625 --> 01:45:50,833
'I can't burst firecrackers for you, but hear this.' 

1303
01:45:51,625 --> 01:45:52,916
'War, dad! War! ' 

1304
01:45:53,083 --> 01:45:55,333
'After a long wait, finally the regiment has got its chance.' 

1305
01:45:55,666 --> 01:45:58,041
'I'm Sitting... waiting in the trench for my counter-attack team! ' 

1306
01:45:58,083 --> 01:46:00,500
'Mom, Dad I wanted to come for your... ' anniversary celebrations... 

1307
01:46:00,583 --> 01:46:02,000
'... and surprise you ' 

1308
01:46:03,416 --> 01:46:05,416
'But sorry, I won't be able to make it.' 

1309
01:46:05,833 --> 01:46:07,625
'I had asked for a 2 day leave but was rejected.' 

1310
01:46:08,458 --> 01:46:10,000
'But, even they are not in the wrong.' 

1311
01:46:10,416 --> 01:46:11,708
'lf every request would be granted.. 

1312
01:46:11,791 --> 01:46:13,958
..then would common man fight the war?' 

1313
01:46:17,666 --> 01:46:19,416
'Singh! Singh! ' 

1314
01:46:19,875 --> 01:46:21,833
'Enough! Enough! I've to go now. Singh is injured!' 

1315
01:46:21,916 --> 01:46:23,875
'Report to base command!' Fast! I am going! 

1316
01:46:23,958 --> 01:46:27,333
'Sir! It is risky! ' - 'I've got to go. I can't leave him alone.' 

1317
01:46:27,416 --> 01:46:28,708
'We have to get him back. - Sir.' 

1318
01:46:28,791 --> 01:46:30,041
'Report to base Command now! I'm going.' 

1319
01:46:30,125 --> 01:46:33,291
'Base command, Tiger 23 reporting! Tiger 23 reporting, base command! ' 

1320
01:46:33,375 --> 01:46:34,708
'Sir! Sir! ' - 'C'mon, let's go.' 

1321
01:46:34,791 --> 01:46:36,458
'Sir, why are you taking this risk for my sake?' 

1322
01:46:36,541 --> 01:46:38,375
'Keep you mouth shut,! Come on, let's go.' 

1323
01:46:38,458 --> 01:46:40,958
'C'mon! Come. ' 'Let's go! 

1324
01:47:00,708 --> 01:47:02,166
'Sir! ' 

1325
01:47:02,250 --> 01:47:05,125
'Naqvi! ' - 'Sir! ' 

1326
01:47:07,083 --> 01:47:11,791
'Sir, you're shot. Sir! Sir, why... ' 

1327
01:47:12,875 --> 01:47:15,833
'Keep you mouth shut! ' 

1328
01:47:21,708 --> 01:47:23,750
'We have reached.' - 'Chaudhari, get some water! Get some water! ' 

1329
01:47:27,708 --> 01:47:28,833
'Sir! 

1330
01:47:37,541 --> 01:47:38,666
'Mom! Dad! ' 

1331
01:47:39,750 --> 01:47:41,500
'When you would hear to this tape... ' 

1332
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:45,125
'... I will be watching you from the skies above.' 

1333
01:47:48,125 --> 01:47:49,750
'Don't shed any tears for me.' 

1334
01:47:50,875 --> 01:47:53,666
'And If I would get another life...' 

1335
01:47:55,041 --> 01:48:00,541
'... I would join the army once again and serve my country.' 

1336
01:48:02,625 --> 01:48:05,000
'Dad, please forgive me.' 

1337
01:48:08,083 --> 01:48:11,416
'Mom, I love you.' 

1338
01:48:12,416 --> 01:48:14,000
'Tiger 23 reporting, base command!' 

1339
01:48:14,083 --> 01:48:16,500
'... Indian Army has achieved victory at point.5127.' 

1340
01:48:16,583 --> 01:48:18,250
'Lt. Sahil Naqvi has been martyred.' 

1341
01:48:37,500 --> 01:48:42,916
One year after Sahil was gone, Singh brought this tape to me. 

1342
01:48:44,958 --> 01:48:47,041
Can, someone who gave up his life saving... 

1343
01:48:47,125 --> 01:48:51,500
...his companion's life, be a coward? 

1344
01:48:56,291 --> 01:48:58,291
I have accepted the truth. 

1345
01:49:00,625 --> 01:49:02,375
But not his father. 

1346
01:49:05,791 --> 01:49:07,666
He is angry with his own son. 

1347
01:49:11,416 --> 01:49:16,291
It's been three years, I am still trying... 

1348
01:49:18,708 --> 01:49:21,041
I want to bring back my routine. 

1349
01:49:23,291 --> 01:49:27,583
Maybe that is why these tea parties... and Mrs. Deoji... 

1350
01:49:40,583 --> 01:49:42,208
My son was not a coward. 

1351
01:49:43,958 --> 01:49:45,291
He was very brave. 

1352
01:49:48,375 --> 01:49:50,083
And I am proud of him. 

1353
01:49:59,166 --> 01:50:06,291
"It's the same heart..." 

1354
01:50:06,458 --> 01:50:12,333
"It's the same world." 

1355
01:50:13,666 --> 01:50:19,833
"Then why this world... 

1356
01:50:19,916 --> 01:50:26,666
...appears changed?" 

1357
01:50:29,666 --> 01:50:40,458
"Why do I avoid meeting eyes with myself?" 

1358
01:50:40,541 --> 01:50:45,041
"Who came and whispered in ears to come down..." 

1359
01:51:16,416 --> 01:51:19,625
I am just proud to live as your widow. 

1360
01:51:28,208 --> 01:51:30,083
You know, a few days back I was posted 

1361
01:51:30,166 --> 01:51:31,958
...on a hill top near a river. 

1362
01:51:32,791 --> 01:51:36,250
There along with my comrades I've learnt a way of fishing. 

1363
01:51:36,708 --> 01:51:39,833
Catching fish with your bare hands has a different charm all together. 

1364
01:51:40,208 --> 01:51:42,458
Folding your pants. 

1365
01:51:49,625 --> 01:51:52,958
And getting knee-deep into icy cold water. 

1366
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:58,750
In a few moments everything goes numb. 

1367
01:52:02,750 --> 01:52:06,333
Then we put our hands into the freezing waters. 

1368
01:52:08,750 --> 01:52:10,708
You can't feel a thing except the slithering of... 

1369
01:52:13,916 --> 01:52:15,500
...a fish passing from in between your hands... 

1370
01:52:15,583 --> 01:52:17,166
..and with that your hands start to shake automatically... 

1371
01:52:17,250 --> 01:52:18,875
...instantly you grab the fish 

1372
01:52:47,875 --> 01:52:49,583
- The film has been completed. 

1373
01:52:50,708 --> 01:52:52,458
But somewhere, it still seems incomplete. 

1374
01:52:54,125 --> 01:52:58,333
Somewhere, there still is a missing link. 

1375
01:53:00,333 --> 01:53:01,708
An emotion... 

1376
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:15,666
Nawab Saab, I was wrong, buddy. 

1377
01:53:37,041 --> 01:53:41,791
Nawab Saab, pride is not just a small word. 

1378
01:53:43,083 --> 01:53:45,000
It is a reason to live. 

1379
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:49,041
That binds families together. 

1380
01:53:50,875 --> 01:53:55,041
That helps them live, even after they've lost everything. 

1381
01:53:56,416 --> 01:53:58,125
That's what they live for. 

1382
01:54:01,833 --> 01:54:03,458
There's nothing greater than pride. 

1383
01:54:04,458 --> 01:54:07,833
Pride, above all else! 

1384
01:54:09,041 --> 01:54:10,375
You're right, Sammy. 

1385
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:13,875
We just think about ourselves. 

1386
01:54:14,583 --> 01:54:17,958
But these soldiers, they think about the whole nation. 

1387
01:54:19,500 --> 01:54:22,000
Sitting in one corner, we cannot decide... 

1388
01:54:22,041 --> 01:54:24,833
...What a soldier must be feeling sitting at the border. 

1389
01:54:25,625 --> 01:54:29,041
He sits waiting in the cold nights so that we can sleep peacefully. 

1390
01:54:31,208 --> 01:54:33,000
One soldier is better than ten like us. 

1391
01:54:35,916 --> 01:54:39,916
The sacrifice that a soldier makes is too great. 

1392
01:54:41,083 --> 01:54:43,750
And that of their families is even greater! 

1393
01:54:45,291 --> 01:54:47,250
To live without your loved ones is not easy. 

1394
01:54:48,583 --> 01:54:50,666
Just think about it Sammy... tomorrow... 

1395
01:54:50,750 --> 01:54:53,000
...I'm not there and you are here, all alone? 

1396
01:55:03,541 --> 01:55:07,166
It's true Nawab. I have not done anything in my life... 

1397
01:55:07,250 --> 01:55:11,541
...of Which I could feel proud about myself. 

1398
01:55:13,291 --> 01:55:14,583
Never ever! 

1399
01:55:18,541 --> 01:55:19,958
What are you waiting for? 

1400
01:55:21,541 --> 01:55:22,750
Let's do it. 

1401
01:55:25,791 --> 01:55:28,125
'Dr. Naqvi hated his own son.' 

1402
01:55:29,166 --> 01:55:31,958
'And it became our motto to remove this hatred.' 

1403
01:55:34,541 --> 01:55:36,833
'They say that... To remove hatred... ' 

1404
01:55:37,208 --> 01:55:38,916
'It is necessary to bring memories back first.' 

1405
01:56:21,958 --> 01:56:24,458
Sahil! Sahil! Sahil! 

1406
01:56:24,541 --> 01:56:27,208
Sahil! Sahil! Sahil! 

1407
01:56:27,291 --> 01:56:29,458
Sahil! Sahil! Sahil! 

1408
01:56:29,791 --> 01:56:32,666
Sahil! Sahil! Sahil! 

1409
01:56:49,291 --> 01:56:52,708
Dad, c'mon, Dad, go ahead! 

1410
01:56:52,791 --> 01:56:56,000
Dad, quickly, run! C'mon! C'mon, Dad. Fast. - I'm ready! 

1411
01:56:56,208 --> 01:56:59,833
Run, Dad, run! Faster Dad! Quickly! - I'm not a Ferrari! 

1412
01:56:59,916 --> 01:57:03,291
Catch! Catch it Dad! - Oh no! 

1413
01:57:03,375 --> 01:57:07,291
Sahil! Sahil! Sahil! - Dad! 

1414
01:57:11,375 --> 01:57:12,708
Catch it Dad! 

1415
01:57:17,666 --> 01:57:19,000
C'mon, Dad! 

1416
01:57:24,916 --> 01:57:26,750
Yes. 

1417
01:57:29,041 --> 01:57:31,250
Yes. - I got it! - Yes! 

1418
01:57:31,333 --> 01:57:34,375
I got it, son! - Yes! 

1419
01:57:34,958 --> 01:57:36,583
I got it! 

1420
01:57:37,708 --> 01:57:40,041
I got it! - Yeah Dad! 

1421
01:57:40,125 --> 01:57:41,750
I got it! - Superb! 

1422
01:57:41,958 --> 01:57:44,208
I got it, son! 

1423
01:57:45,416 --> 01:57:47,708
Superb! - Sahil! 

1424
01:57:49,291 --> 01:57:52,708
I've transferred all my property in your name. 

1425
01:57:52,791 --> 01:57:54,000
Good idea, dad! 

1426
01:57:54,458 --> 01:57:57,500
Then why do you still want to kill me? 

1427
01:58:00,458 --> 01:58:01,875
Congratulations, doctor! 

1428
01:58:02,333 --> 01:58:05,958
Bloody shit! You too are hand-in-glove with him, right? 

1429
01:58:07,250 --> 01:58:11,041
Father and son have done it yet again! - He's the best! 

1430
01:58:12,458 --> 01:58:15,750
So tell me, Where have you been posted this time? - Drass sector. 

1431
01:58:16,083 --> 01:58:18,375
Hmmm... It is a very sensitive area. 

1432
01:58:19,083 --> 01:58:20,208
So I've heard. 

1433
01:58:43,041 --> 01:58:44,166
Dad. 

1434
01:58:50,916 --> 01:58:53,125
You said you have a month long holiday. 

1435
01:58:54,875 --> 01:58:58,916
Even last year, you received an urgent telegram and... 

1436
01:58:59,875 --> 01:59:01,875
Dad, you too have to attend emergency calls, right. 

1437
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:05,416
Yours are unreasonable. 

1438
01:59:06,500 --> 01:59:10,708
Sometimes I wonder... in a family where everyone is a doctor... 

1439
01:59:11,458 --> 01:59:13,625
...what was the need for you to join the army. 

1440
01:59:14,458 --> 01:59:16,416
What is so special about that uniform... 

1441
01:59:16,500 --> 01:59:18,041
...that isn't there in this white coat? 

1442
01:59:18,875 --> 01:59:20,166
Maybe they both are just the same. 

1443
01:59:22,041 --> 01:59:24,208
Because both uniforms are made to save lives. 

1444
01:59:25,416 --> 01:59:27,000
You save your patients. 

1445
01:59:28,541 --> 01:59:29,875
And I protect my country. 

1446
01:59:36,041 --> 01:59:39,208
Sahil, you can go.. 

1447
01:59:41,291 --> 01:59:42,583
..if you want to. 

1448
01:59:44,541 --> 01:59:48,250
But you have to come back for me. 

1449
01:59:49,958 --> 01:59:51,833
For me, you have to come back! - Dad! 

1450
01:59:54,958 --> 02:00:00,041
Dad, I promise I will come back. 

1451
02:00:04,791 --> 02:00:06,125
You lied to me! 

1452
02:00:08,833 --> 02:00:10,000
I hate you! 

1453
02:00:12,333 --> 02:00:13,791
I hate you! 

1454
02:00:19,125 --> 02:00:21,000
These are from our Kashmir holiday. 

1455
02:00:21,083 --> 02:00:24,833
After that the insurgence began. And then... 

1456
02:00:29,458 --> 02:00:31,458
This is Sahil's favorite tune. 

1457
02:00:35,791 --> 02:00:38,791
He used to ask me to dance with him all the time. 

1458
02:00:40,583 --> 02:00:44,875
And his papa used to watch us from that corner. 

1459
02:00:52,458 --> 02:00:54,375
Come on, let's dance. 

1460
02:00:55,458 --> 02:00:56,625
No, son. 

1461
02:00:56,916 --> 02:00:59,000
Come on. - No. 

1462
02:00:59,208 --> 02:01:00,375
Come on! 

1463
02:01:43,291 --> 02:01:45,125
What do you think of yourselves? 

1464
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:48,375
You are not Sahil! 

1465
02:01:50,250 --> 02:01:51,458
Get out! 

1466
02:01:53,291 --> 02:01:54,500
I said get out! 

1467
02:02:01,791 --> 02:02:03,375
What is your problem, doctor? 

1468
02:02:04,750 --> 02:02:06,708
Have you given a thought as to why these kids are doing this? 

1469
02:02:07,500 --> 02:02:08,791
They are no one of ours. 

1470
02:02:08,875 --> 02:02:11,833
If they are no one of ours then why are they even here? 

1471
02:02:13,666 --> 02:02:15,791
Why don't you all leave me alone? 

1472
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:20,125
Nobody is trying to change you. 

1473
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:23,833
They are just trying to bring some joy back into your life. 

1474
02:02:25,208 --> 02:02:27,958
Some joy that you cannot even see. 

1475
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:29,791
I don't want anybody's favor. 

1476
02:02:30,541 --> 02:02:31,875
This is my life! 

1477
02:02:33,083 --> 02:02:35,541
And I'll live it the way I want to! 

1478
02:02:36,958 --> 02:02:38,125
Your life! 

1479
02:02:40,583 --> 02:02:42,166
It is so easy for you to say that. 

1480
02:02:44,166 --> 02:02:48,166
Did you ever think, about the woman who lives in this house? 

1481
02:02:48,666 --> 02:02:50,041
The woman who is your wife. 

1482
02:02:51,416 --> 02:02:56,833
Have you realized that you've heard my voice after 3 months? 

1483
02:02:58,250 --> 02:03:00,125
Have you ever thought about your son? 

1484
02:03:00,833 --> 02:03:01,958
How sad and hurt must he be? 

1485
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:04,958
No I haven't! And I don't want to think about him! 

1486
02:03:05,333 --> 02:03:06,541
He is dead! 

1487
02:03:09,916 --> 02:03:14,333
Such hatred! Such anger and bitterness! 

1488
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:17,500
For your own son? 

1489
02:03:19,416 --> 02:03:23,166
Just because he left you alone? 

1490
02:03:26,708 --> 02:03:29,708
Why don't you think that he has saved someone else's father... 

1491
02:03:29,791 --> 02:03:33,750
...from the pain of being separated from his son? 

1492
02:03:36,583 --> 02:03:38,416
Selfish! - And you? 

1493
02:04:16,666 --> 02:04:22,125
Sahil! Sahil! Sahil! Sahil! Sahil! Sahil! 

1494
02:04:22,208 --> 02:04:23,916
Move! C'mon! C'mon! 

1495
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:26,416
Sahil! Sahil! Sahil! 

1496
02:04:27,791 --> 02:04:34,625
Sahil! Sahil! Sahil! Sahil! Sahil! Sahil! 

1497
02:04:37,041 --> 02:04:38,166
Touchdown! 

1498
02:04:38,250 --> 02:04:39,541
Oh! - Oh... 

1499
02:04:42,625 --> 02:04:48,958
Sahil! Sahil! Sahil! Sahil! Sahil! Sahil! 

1500
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:51,875
Nawab saab, Sahil's team can not lose. 

1501
02:04:52,791 --> 02:04:56,291
We won't lose. This is our last chance. 

1502
02:04:57,166 --> 02:04:59,000
Saand, you go straight. 

1503
02:04:59,083 --> 02:05:01,041
Saangi, you attack from the right. 

1504
02:05:01,333 --> 02:05:03,250
Namgyal, you cover me. I am going to throw the ball. 

1505
02:05:03,333 --> 02:05:05,583
And girls this is... - Pass me the ball. 

1506
02:05:19,875 --> 02:05:21,041
Move. 

1507
02:05:29,333 --> 02:05:31,875
Run! - Sahil! Sahil! Sahil! 

1508
02:05:31,958 --> 02:05:34,583
Go ahead! Sahil! Sahil! Sahil! 

1509
02:05:34,666 --> 02:05:36,750
Hey, c'mon, cover your man... - Sahil! Sahil! Sahil! 

1510
02:05:36,833 --> 02:05:39,583
Cover your man! - Sahil! Sahil! Sahil! 

1511
02:05:39,666 --> 02:05:42,791
Don't leave your man alone. 

1512
02:05:42,875 --> 02:05:46,083
Don't leave your man alone. Don't leave your man alone. alone. 

1513
02:05:46,166 --> 02:05:48,916
Don't leave your man alone. Don't leave your man alone. 

1514
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:51,375
Have to bring him back. 'Report to base command!' 

1515
02:05:51,458 --> 02:05:53,666
- Nab him! Cover him. 

1516
02:05:55,958 --> 02:05:58,500
Don't leave your man alone. 

1517
02:05:58,583 --> 02:06:01,875
- Sahil! Sahil! Sahil! 

1518
02:06:01,958 --> 02:06:04,000
Run! 

1519
02:06:11,166 --> 02:06:13,750
Run! 

1520
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:27,958
Sahil! Sahil! Sahil! 

1521
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:30,625
Saaaahil! 

1522
02:06:38,875 --> 02:06:42,958
Saaaahil! 

1523
02:06:49,291 --> 02:06:55,875
Saaaahil! catch it! 

1524
02:07:46,291 --> 02:07:48,833
I caught it, Dad! I caught it! 

1525
02:07:54,958 --> 02:07:59,416
Sahil! Sahil! Sahil! 

1526
02:07:59,500 --> 02:08:02,000
Sahil! Sahil! Sahil! 

1527
02:08:02,083 --> 02:08:04,708
Sahil! Sahil! Sahil! 

1528
02:08:04,791 --> 02:08:07,291
Sahil! Sahil! Sahil! 

1529
02:08:07,375 --> 02:08:10,000
Sahil! Sahil! Sahil! 

1530
02:08:10,041 --> 02:08:12,500
Sahil! Sahil! Sahil! 

1531
02:08:12,583 --> 02:08:15,166
Sahil! Sahil! Sahil! 

1532
02:08:15,250 --> 02:08:17,833
Sahil! Sahil! Sahil! 

1533
02:08:17,916 --> 02:08:22,125
Sahil! Sahil! Sahil! 

1534
02:08:31,333 --> 02:08:33,791
Sahil! Sahil! Sahil! 

1535
02:08:37,833 --> 02:08:40,416
Sahil! Sahil! Sahil! 

1536
02:08:40,500 --> 02:08:43,041
Sahil! Sahil! Sahil! 

1537
02:09:36,166 --> 02:09:42,833
I am sorry. I am sorry. 

1538
02:09:48,625 --> 02:09:51,458
I... I.. 

1539
02:09:53,875 --> 02:09:55,333
..I miss you a lot. 

1540
02:09:57,750 --> 02:09:59,250
I miss you a lot. 

1541
02:10:10,500 --> 02:10:12,083
You were not wrong Sahil. 

1542
02:10:13,125 --> 02:10:15,041
Today I did the same thing on the playground... 

1543
02:10:15,666 --> 02:10:17,500
...that you did in the battle field. 

1544
02:10:20,166 --> 02:10:23,291
You had said that if you were born again... 

1545
02:10:23,375 --> 02:10:28,875
...you would again choose to join the army and serve your country. 

1546
02:10:33,666 --> 02:10:35,416
Just do me one favor, Sahil. 

1547
02:10:40,291 --> 02:10:43,625
Choose me as your father again. 

1548
02:11:19,916 --> 02:11:21,666
Our son was a hero. 

1549
02:11:59,833 --> 02:12:01,250
Hey! Tell me when to let it go! 

1550
02:12:01,333 --> 02:12:04,041
Sir, don't be afraid. Go back a little. 

1551
02:12:05,958 --> 02:12:07,916
Now release it. - Ok? 

1552
02:12:11,416 --> 02:12:15,916
When you complete your movie, cut this kite. 

1553
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:20,291
This will reach to me and I'll know that your movie has completed. 

1554
02:12:20,708 --> 02:12:22,291
That's for you, Jassi. 

1555
02:12:37,708 --> 02:12:40,750
Piya was right Sometimes a little step towards... 

1556
02:12:40,833 --> 02:12:42,833
...something takes you to a lifelong path. 

1557
02:12:43,625 --> 02:12:45,000
We found our path. 

1558
02:12:45,750 --> 02:12:48,166
Two common people became two patriots! 

1559
02:12:49,625 --> 02:12:51,041
Both of us didn't go to the US. 

1560
02:12:51,750 --> 02:12:55,166
We tried Army exams twice, but failed. 

1561
02:12:55,666 --> 02:12:59,708
We didn't even join the family business. 

1562
02:13:00,125 --> 02:13:02,958
We wanted to do something for our country in full earnestness. 

1563
02:13:03,708 --> 02:13:08,541
We opened a school, not to teach anything, but to share an emotion. 

1564
02:13:08,750 --> 02:13:10,541
In which we had full faith. 

1565
02:13:11,083 --> 02:13:13,000
Pride is above all else. 

1566
02:13:13,458 --> 02:13:14,791
Good morning! - Good morning sir! 

1567
02:13:14,875 --> 02:13:16,750
Good morning! - Good morning. 

1568
02:13:21,875 --> 02:13:27,458
Saand, it feels good buddy! When students tell us. 

1569
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:30,416
Sir, we want to prove. 

1570
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:13,875
Mr. Sameer... Mr. Ali! 

1571
02:14:15,875 --> 02:14:17,000
Yes, officer. 

1572
02:14:18,875 --> 02:14:20,625
Maybe both of you haven't recognized me. 

1573
02:14:34,166 --> 02:14:36,791
Now do you recognize me, Saand praji! Nawab Saab! 

1574
02:14:37,958 --> 02:14:39,500
Hey Jassi! 

1575
02:14:42,666 --> 02:14:43,833
Here, Take this. 

1576
02:14:47,958 --> 02:14:52,000
Invitation to the IMA parade? IMA? 

1577
02:14:53,208 --> 02:14:54,916
Lt. Jaswindar Singh. 

1578
02:14:56,083 --> 02:14:57,250
How is your mother? 

1579
02:14:57,666 --> 02:14:59,958
Mom is fine. She takes care of herself. 

1580
02:15:00,375 --> 02:15:03,041
And I, take care of my nation. 

1581
02:15:10,583 --> 02:15:14,791
Saand praji! You are just the same! 

1582
02:15:15,041 --> 02:15:19,249
Did you marry or still a celibate.
