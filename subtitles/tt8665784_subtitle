1
00:00:10,167 --> 00:00:12,817
Why will you have bad things like
cigarettes, beedis and tobacco?

2
00:00:13,024 --> 00:00:16,579
They cause cancer.
Have nice things like Roshogolla.

3
00:00:20,307 --> 00:00:25,185
(voiceover)

4
00:02:59,667 --> 00:03:06,061
KALIKA IT'S ALL BECAUSE OF YOU
11th SEPTEMBER 1970 - 7th MARCH 2017

5
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:04,265
Don't you have a home?

6
00:07:04,265 --> 00:07:06,057
Why are you roaming hither and thither?

7
00:07:06,057 --> 00:07:09,182
What do I do?
You never stop to sing.

8
00:07:09,182 --> 00:07:12,057
You're roaming and singing …
I'm roaming and listening.

9
00:07:12,057 --> 00:07:13,515
Will you not sing any more?

10
00:07:13,515 --> 00:07:14,807
What do I gain from that?

11
00:07:14,807 --> 00:07:16,015
But you're a fakir!

12
00:07:16,015 --> 00:07:20,140
Good heavens! My mind is fakir,
not my belly!

13
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:22,390
People give me something or
the other for my singing...

14
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:23,682
What will you give?

15
00:07:23,682 --> 00:07:24,474
Me?

16
00:07:26,099 --> 00:07:27,724
Aaa …

17
00:07:52,432 --> 00:07:56,890
Take this … it's 'monda'!
Take! Take!

18
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:59,432
Gosh! This is rich man's food!
Will it suit my belly?

19
00:07:59,432 --> 00:08:02,807
Mother says whatever the food is,
you should have respect for it.

20
00:08:02,807 --> 00:08:04,515
She's right!
Absolutely true!

21
00:08:04,515 --> 00:08:09,224
You'll continue to give 'monda' to
all throughout your life.

22
00:08:09,224 --> 00:08:12,307
Only give?
Shall I not have them too?

23
00:08:14,557 --> 00:08:18,057
Not all people come to this world to eat.

24
00:08:18,057 --> 00:08:20,057
Some come to feed others.

25
00:08:20,057 --> 00:08:23,182
Your work will be to feed everyone...

26
00:08:29,807 --> 00:08:34,765
Rosogolla...

27
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:56,474
Oh my my!

28
00:08:56,474 --> 00:08:59,974
My little one, what will you be?

29
00:08:59,974 --> 00:09:01,974
Pick up!
Come here! Here! Here!

30
00:09:02,307 --> 00:09:04,015
Kartikda!

31
00:09:06,182 --> 00:09:07,224
O Kartikda!

32
00:09:07,224 --> 00:09:08,599
What's up?

33
00:09:08,599 --> 00:09:13,890
Bring the fried shrimps.
I'll add them to the mochaar ghanto.

34
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:15,849
What're you doing?
Mixing non-veg in a veg item?

35
00:09:15,849 --> 00:09:18,515
Oh! Mixing food with food.

36
00:09:18,515 --> 00:09:20,307
Don't spare words! Just give it.

37
00:09:20,307 --> 00:09:22,974
Those are worms.
No one adds them to mocha.

38
00:09:22,974 --> 00:09:24,474
Never happens like that.

39
00:09:24,474 --> 00:09:26,515
Never happens, is it?

40
00:09:28,099 --> 00:09:30,474
That's what you're saying Kartikda?

41
00:09:30,474 --> 00:09:31,599
Didn't I tell you it doesn't work?

42
00:09:31,599 --> 00:09:33,682
It does.
What?

43
00:09:34,557 --> 00:09:37,140
From now on, it'll work.

44
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:58,682
Harisadhan, is this feast for your grandson's
naming ceremony or his marriage?

45
00:09:58,682 --> 00:10:01,182
It's awesome! Just awesome!

46
00:10:02,807 --> 00:10:05,974
Harisadhan! Would you please
call your cook?

47
00:10:05,974 --> 00:10:08,765
I'll give him a reward of
whole one rupee.

48
00:10:08,765 --> 00:10:12,182
What're you saying?
He'll become rich!

49
00:10:12,182 --> 00:10:14,390
I'm calling him.

50
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:17,057
Kartik! Come here for once!

51
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:24,724
Being extremely pleased with your
preparations, they want to reward you.

52
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:26,307
Me?

53
00:10:26,307 --> 00:10:28,390
A whole rupee!

54
00:10:30,974 --> 00:10:32,807
Take this.

55
00:10:34,932 --> 00:10:37,640
Ok, then Harisadhan!
Now we'll take leave of you.

56
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,515
Bye! Please come again!

57
00:10:39,515 --> 00:10:40,724
Oh sure!

58
00:10:52,765 --> 00:10:55,640
Fed on my money you've grown
to be a fat pig...

59
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,974
And now you're seeking
explanation from me?

60
00:10:59,974 --> 00:11:02,724
What answer do I have?
What do you want me to say –

61
00:11:02,724 --> 00:11:05,182
That my nephew works
in the kitchen like a woman.

62
00:11:05,182 --> 00:11:07,140
And it fills my heart with pride?

63
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:10,057
Then why do people engage
male cooks for cooking?

64
00:11:10,057 --> 00:11:12,474
They get money for cooking.

65
00:11:12,474 --> 00:11:14,140
And it is their job.

66
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,515
Strange!

67
00:11:15,515 --> 00:11:17,724
If you earn for your job,
you're a man...

68
00:11:17,724 --> 00:11:19,724
If you don't, you're a woman?

69
00:11:19,724 --> 00:11:21,640
Hey! Please stop!

70
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,640
What kind of a logic is this?

71
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,432
Yes Aunty!
You better take him away!

72
00:11:25,432 --> 00:11:29,557
Look at that! He has learnt the art
of quarrelling like a woman!

73
00:11:29,557 --> 00:11:31,432
Well...

74
00:11:31,432 --> 00:11:36,432
Since I'll have to be a man,
brother, I've decided

75
00:11:36,432 --> 00:11:39,099
From now on I'll not
cook for this house.

76
00:11:39,099 --> 00:11:40,724
No!

77
00:11:40,724 --> 00:11:42,140
I'll work in a sweetmeat shop.

78
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:44,932
In seven generations, no one
in our family has done such work.

79
00:11:44,932 --> 00:11:47,557
And you're planning to become
a 'moira' (a sweetmeat maker)?

80
00:11:47,557 --> 00:11:48,724
'Moira'?

81
00:11:49,849 --> 00:11:51,307
But brother!

82
00:11:52,182 --> 00:11:55,432
He'll have to
get engaged in some work.

83
00:11:55,432 --> 00:11:58,099
Did you see that?

84
00:11:58,099 --> 00:12:00,974
Only you have spoiled him!

85
00:12:00,974 --> 00:12:03,432
If you do that,
from this day onwards,

86
00:12:03,432 --> 00:12:06,932
I'll have no relationship with you two.

87
00:12:06,932 --> 00:12:08,890
I…

88
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:11,390
...will … become...

89
00:12:11,932 --> 00:12:13,599
… a … 'moira'.

90
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:20,307
From today that's the end of
all my relations with you!

91
00:12:20,307 --> 00:12:21,474
You two are no one for me.

92
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:23,432
Is that it?
Yes, it is.

93
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:27,515
Is that it?
I've already said that.

94
00:12:27,515 --> 00:12:31,474
Good! Ma, from today you'll
have less hard work to do.

95
00:12:36,057 --> 00:12:38,640
Why are you so afraid?

96
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:44,099
Do I have to listen to
them as I'm fatherless?

97
00:12:44,099 --> 00:12:46,099
But I've my fears.

98
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:47,682
What's the use of
quarrelling with others?

99
00:12:47,682 --> 00:12:49,890
You're coward! Not me.

100
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:54,349
And listen Ma! Till today,
what has he done for us?

101
00:12:54,349 --> 00:12:59,432
Eh! They stay upstairs doing nothing...
I don't need such relations.

102
00:12:59,432 --> 00:13:03,057
I only want you to do good work.

103
00:13:03,057 --> 00:13:04,765
Work?

104
00:13:04,765 --> 00:13:07,057
Who will give me work?

105
00:13:07,057 --> 00:13:08,474
Why?

106
00:13:08,474 --> 00:13:13,015
Just now you were boasting of
becoming a 'moira'.

107
00:13:13,015 --> 00:13:15,099
Oh! I said it just for that!

108
00:13:15,099 --> 00:13:17,432
I knew it.

109
00:13:17,432 --> 00:13:19,932
I've already told Reba...

110
00:13:19,932 --> 00:13:23,515
to inform me of any vacancy
in her husband's shop.

111
00:13:23,515 --> 00:13:28,307
She said – if she tells her husband,
it'll be done.

112
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:31,182
Kalidas Indra's sweet shop?

113
00:13:31,182 --> 00:13:32,932
Yes.
In Bagbazar?

114
00:13:32,932 --> 00:13:35,682
Yes.
Very large sweet shop Ma!

115
00:13:39,515 --> 00:13:41,515
Kalidas Indra!

116
00:13:41,515 --> 00:13:43,474
Will he appoint me?

117
00:13:45,057 --> 00:13:48,682
Some people still listen to your
coward mother.

118
00:13:48,682 --> 00:13:52,307
Oh Ma! You're my
sepoy of Barrackpore!

119
00:13:52,307 --> 00:13:55,724
It's hurting!
Leave! Leave me!

120
00:14:17,224 --> 00:14:19,265
I can make banana flower
with shrimps,

121
00:14:19,265 --> 00:14:22,182
Hot spicy fried poppy seed pellets,
Kalai pulses with hing...

122
00:14:22,182 --> 00:14:23,265
Did I ask you?

123
00:14:23,265 --> 00:14:24,974
Chingri boi khilli,

124
00:14:24,974 --> 00:14:26,515
Jalpai chatney with coconut,

125
00:14:26,515 --> 00:14:28,890
Murhi ghanto...
Did I want to know?

126
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:31,015
Nnnn...

127
00:14:31,015 --> 00:14:32,849
No!
If you want to work here...

128
00:14:32,849 --> 00:14:35,390
no unnecessary word!

129
00:14:37,057 --> 00:14:39,557
When I'm not there,

130
00:14:39,557 --> 00:14:42,307
you'll help them in the sale of goods.

131
00:14:42,307 --> 00:14:45,932
A notebook is there,
Where all the prices are written.

132
00:14:45,932 --> 00:14:47,307
See it! Memorize!

133
00:14:47,307 --> 00:14:49,932
Don't search the notebook
in front of a customer.

134
00:14:49,932 --> 00:14:52,724
And if I find any discrepancy
in the accounts,

135
00:14:52,724 --> 00:14:55,390
I'll cut it from your salary.

136
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:57,515
Shall I...

137
00:14:57,515 --> 00:14:59,849
Shall I not make sweets?

138
00:14:59,849 --> 00:15:01,432
Sweets?

139
00:15:02,349 --> 00:15:05,224
You can make?
How old are you?

140
00:15:05,224 --> 00:15:08,265
Twenty.

141
00:15:08,265 --> 00:15:09,807
Mahesh! Hemen!

142
00:15:09,807 --> 00:15:11,182
Coming!

143
00:15:13,265 --> 00:15:14,807
Show him the workshop!

144
00:15:23,099 --> 00:15:25,057
Come warrior! Come!

145
00:15:27,974 --> 00:15:30,432
I was saying …

146
00:15:30,432 --> 00:15:33,432
a little honey and kismis (dried grapes)

147
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:35,224
sprinkled on these would have
made a marvel – isn't it?

148
00:15:35,224 --> 00:15:37,724
And some cashew …
Tell the master …

149
00:15:37,724 --> 00:15:39,349
Not one slap will miss your cheeks.

150
00:15:39,349 --> 00:15:42,390
Do all those marvels when
you start your own shop.

151
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:44,765
I was just …
Hold this!

152
00:15:44,765 --> 00:15:46,807
Go!

153
00:15:50,474 --> 00:15:53,015
Nobinbabu!
Yes!

154
00:15:54,599 --> 00:15:57,182
I was about to go!

155
00:15:58,224 --> 00:16:02,599
Don't tell about your
own ideas to others!

156
00:16:02,599 --> 00:16:06,224
It will make him angry like
a red hot iron.

157
00:16:06,224 --> 00:16:07,849
What are you saying?

158
00:16:07,849 --> 00:16:10,307
Nothing! What did I say?

159
00:16:12,349 --> 00:16:16,140
First do it to show them
what you want to do.

160
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:17,765
In spite of that those
who will see your work...

161
00:16:17,765 --> 00:16:19,724
will get angry like a red hot iron.

162
00:16:19,724 --> 00:16:21,849
Chatterbox!
Babbling the whole day!

163
00:16:21,849 --> 00:16:24,515
Come on!
Do your own work!

164
00:16:27,432 --> 00:16:32,057
Kismis is there in that box down there!

165
00:16:43,849 --> 00:16:48,515
Once Rama had said …

166
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:58,099
Be satisfied with this
much...

167
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:27,349
Who are you?

168
00:17:27,349 --> 00:17:30,182
Thief.
Tttttt … Thief! Thief!

169
00:17:30,182 --> 00:17:32,557
Oh! No no no!

170
00:17:32,557 --> 00:17:33,724
Hide and seek?

171
00:17:33,724 --> 00:17:34,724
Thief of that game.

172
00:17:35,557 --> 00:17:37,349
Oh!

173
00:17:37,349 --> 00:17:38,890
See outside!
What?

174
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:42,307
Asking you to look outside!

175
00:17:45,724 --> 00:17:49,057
Did you see? Fatty?

176
00:17:50,349 --> 00:17:53,932
Yes. He's the actual thief
looking for me!

177
00:17:53,932 --> 00:17:56,057
Hey! Hey!

178
00:17:56,057 --> 00:17:58,640
Is he looking this side?

179
00:18:01,015 --> 00:18:03,432
Hmm! Looking this side.

180
00:18:03,432 --> 00:18:05,849
Is he coming this way?

181
00:18:08,265 --> 00:18:11,349
Good that he takes
six months to move.

182
00:18:16,057 --> 00:18:18,807
Relieved! He's gone!

183
00:18:18,807 --> 00:18:20,224
Now you can go peacefully!

184
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:22,890
He may be still hiding there...

185
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:25,682
to catch me as soon as
I come out.

186
00:18:27,307 --> 00:18:31,015
A person has come for so long
can't you even offer her a glass of water?

187
00:18:31,015 --> 00:18:32,224
Is it my house?

188
00:18:32,224 --> 00:18:35,349
Don't you know guest is God?

189
00:18:41,265 --> 00:18:43,515
What are you mumbling?

190
00:18:43,515 --> 00:18:44,724
No! Nothing!

191
00:18:44,724 --> 00:18:46,557
What at all are you doing?

192
00:18:46,557 --> 00:18:48,724
Nothing! Doing my work!

193
00:18:48,724 --> 00:18:52,599
Do your own work damn it!
Why're you after him?

194
00:18:59,599 --> 00:19:01,432
What's the name of that sweet?

195
00:19:01,432 --> 00:19:03,599
What?
That one! What's its name?

196
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:06,099
'Khirer sandesh'.

197
00:19:06,099 --> 00:19:08,724
Let's see! Give me one.

198
00:19:18,682 --> 00:19:20,807
There the kismis is my addition.

199
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:25,224
It's not so good!

200
00:19:25,224 --> 00:19:26,974
Oh my my! Not good?

201
00:19:26,974 --> 00:19:29,015
No.
Wait.

202
00:19:32,682 --> 00:19:35,265
Just have this!

203
00:19:35,265 --> 00:19:37,015
This is good …

204
00:20:10,307 --> 00:20:11,807
Who makes such sweets?

205
00:20:11,807 --> 00:20:14,099
Had sixteen sweets?

206
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,015
Not one satisfied you?

207
00:20:17,015 --> 00:20:19,224
The worker is unripe! Young!

208
00:20:19,224 --> 00:20:21,640
No no no! I do not make these.

209
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:24,182
All of them are by Hemenda.
He's nearing 40 …

210
00:20:24,182 --> 00:20:25,974
Can't do a thing properly!

211
00:20:26,724 --> 00:20:28,099
If he couldn't learn in all this time,

212
00:20:28,099 --> 00:20:29,890
he'll never do it.

213
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:32,515
Why are you laughing?

214
00:20:32,515 --> 00:20:35,265
Look outside for fatty!

215
00:20:35,265 --> 00:20:37,140
Is he there?

216
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:39,099
Ok. I'm seeing!

217
00:20:39,099 --> 00:20:41,390
How sweet!

218
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:50,432
The road is clear.

219
00:20:50,432 --> 00:20:52,224
I'm assuring you!
Don't have to worry!

220
00:20:52,224 --> 00:20:53,349
Now you can peacefully …

221
00:20:55,599 --> 00:20:57,599
Peace …

222
00:20:58,807 --> 00:21:00,182
Here you're … hey... hey …

223
00:21:00,182 --> 00:21:01,807
Stop!

224
00:21:06,224 --> 00:21:07,807
What's this?

225
00:21:09,849 --> 00:21:10,640
What are you doing?

226
00:21:23,974 --> 00:21:26,807
Is she a girl or a demon?

227
00:21:26,807 --> 00:21:29,515
Not one, not two …
gobbled up sixteen sweets?

228
00:21:29,515 --> 00:21:31,515
Sixteen?

229
00:21:31,515 --> 00:21:33,807
I know he is blind,
but what were you all doing?

230
00:21:33,807 --> 00:21:35,974
What can I say Master,

231
00:21:35,974 --> 00:21:38,557
You mean that little girl...

232
00:21:38,557 --> 00:21:40,974
Slightly flabby...
With untied locks...

233
00:21:40,974 --> 00:21:42,724
Yes! Yes!

234
00:21:42,724 --> 00:21:45,224
Has a commanding tone...
Isn't it?

235
00:21:45,224 --> 00:21:49,057
Yes... she is Bhola Moira's
granddaughter.

236
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:52,849
Did I ask you whether she is
granddaughter or a ghost?

237
00:21:52,849 --> 00:21:54,640
Bring the price!

238
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,265
Otherwise, since you've fed her
the sweets to please her

239
00:21:57,265 --> 00:21:59,099
I'll deduct the money from your salary.
Understand?

240
00:21:59,099 --> 00:22:00,765
Your habit is to please people.

241
00:22:00,765 --> 00:22:03,057
You are like a
performer (shong) of Jelepara.

242
00:22:03,057 --> 00:22:05,682
I'll leave you with the shongs of
Kansharipara... during the Pujas next year –

243
00:22:05,682 --> 00:22:08,932
you'll sing and dance to make
people happy, Ok?

244
00:22:08,932 --> 00:22:10,640
Out!
Ok!

245
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,182
Get out!

246
00:22:15,265 --> 00:22:16,349
Kit kit kit kit …

247
00:22:16,349 --> 00:22:18,265
Hey you've stepped on the line!

248
00:22:22,307 --> 00:22:23,724
Bearer stop the carriage.

249
00:22:23,724 --> 00:22:25,640
Hey girl!

250
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,057
This side … look …

251
00:22:27,057 --> 00:22:29,057
Come!

252
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:37,807
Do you know in which direction
is Bhola Moira's house?

253
00:22:37,807 --> 00:22:39,015
I know it...

254
00:22:40,099 --> 00:22:42,140
It's near the palace in Shobhabazar.

255
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:43,890
Shobhabazar?

256
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:46,099
But we were told it's Bagbazar.

257
00:22:46,099 --> 00:22:47,849
I'm speaking.
You keep mum.

258
00:22:47,849 --> 00:22:51,432
It's just beside the palace
of Shobhabazar.

259
00:22:51,432 --> 00:22:54,099
But why are you going there...
to enjoy a musical soiree?

260
00:22:54,099 --> 00:22:55,724
No no no!

261
00:22:57,390 --> 00:23:00,724
Going for the matchmaking
of my son!

262
00:23:00,724 --> 00:23:03,682
O! Matchmaking!

263
00:23:03,682 --> 00:23:06,682
With the granddaughter of
Bhola Moira.

264
00:23:06,682 --> 00:23:09,057
O! Granddaughter!

265
00:23:09,057 --> 00:23:12,849
But reach there before the sun...
comes up on the top of your head.

266
00:23:12,849 --> 00:23:14,224
Why, my dear?

267
00:23:14,224 --> 00:23:17,474
When the sun comes on top,
temperature of her head also rises.

268
00:23:17,474 --> 00:23:19,890
At that time she creates
slight problems.

269
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:20,974
What problem does she create?

270
00:23:20,974 --> 00:23:23,307
Who doesn't bite if he/she
is mentally deranged?

271
00:23:23,307 --> 00:23:27,974
Before you, at least 20 people had
gone after being snapped.

272
00:23:28,724 --> 00:23:30,515
But the girl is very good!

273
00:23:30,515 --> 00:23:33,140
Oh mother!

274
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:37,640
Go if you want to,
but come back before the sunset.

275
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,974
Why my dear?

276
00:23:38,974 --> 00:23:41,057
Whenever the sun sets,
a spirit takes over her.

277
00:23:41,057 --> 00:23:42,432
Spirit!

278
00:23:42,432 --> 00:23:45,682
Yes! Spirits come and enter her head!

279
00:23:45,682 --> 00:23:47,807
But there's no harm in it!

280
00:23:47,807 --> 00:23:49,599
She starts searching for trees
where spirits live.

281
00:23:49,599 --> 00:23:51,015
Maaaaaaa!

282
00:23:51,015 --> 00:23:52,890
But she's a very good girl!

283
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:54,724
You stay here.

284
00:23:54,724 --> 00:23:56,224
How do you know about her
from such a distance?

285
00:23:56,224 --> 00:23:58,599
Only me? Everyone knows.

286
00:23:58,599 --> 00:24:02,307
Hey everyone! Tell them!

287
00:24:08,765 --> 00:24:11,140
Turn the palanquin (palki).

288
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:13,432
Quick!

289
00:24:13,432 --> 00:24:15,640
Ram... Ram... Ram!

290
00:24:18,682 --> 00:24:19,807
Softly!

291
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:24,765
Let's go!

292
00:24:29,432 --> 00:24:30,599
Money!

293
00:25:04,765 --> 00:25:11,099
Kanai, why didn't you come...
In spite of your promise.

294
00:25:13,682 --> 00:25:21,849
When the tie of Braja
has slackened.

295
00:25:37,724 --> 00:25:41,140
I've had to bear so much of pain,
my friend...

296
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:44,932
As the days of spring
fled away.

297
00:25:52,474 --> 00:25:54,974
So many days have gone by...

298
00:25:56,599 --> 00:26:01,807
On the path of the cowherd...
so many days have gone by...

299
00:26:01,807 --> 00:26:06,724
But the notes of that flute
could never be heard!

300
00:26:10,682 --> 00:26:14,599
Hundred flowers bloomed...
and dropped in the garden.

301
00:26:14,599 --> 00:26:18,640
But he never came...
with the nupur tied on his feet!

302
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:26,099
Radha! Radha! Radha! Radha!

303
00:26:43,932 --> 00:26:47,390
Have cast a net in the water of my mind...
to catch you this time.

304
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:50,807
Forget the world and come to me
you butter thief.

305
00:26:57,974 --> 00:27:01,515
Have set a trap under the Kadam tree
to fasten you with my tears.

306
00:27:01,515 --> 00:27:05,015
Forget the world and come to me
you butter thief.

307
00:27:11,557 --> 00:27:15,265
Chant the name of the Lord (Hari)!

308
00:27:44,765 --> 00:27:47,474
Stop! Stop!

309
00:27:47,474 --> 00:27:49,932
Tell me! Where had you been?

310
00:27:49,932 --> 00:27:51,974
See, how she is romping around!

311
00:27:51,974 --> 00:27:54,140
Lost the poise of a girl!
Already fifteen years...

312
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:55,640
but doesn't have any sense as yet!

313
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,849
Don't you know your in-laws to be
are coming to see you today?

314
00:27:57,849 --> 00:28:00,015
And what are you doing?

315
00:28:00,015 --> 00:28:01,890
Look! She is so
much younger to you...

316
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:02,682
even she is married.

317
00:28:02,682 --> 00:28:06,307
Your marriage will never happen.
Come! Come inside!

318
00:28:06,307 --> 00:28:08,307
Aaaa! My money!

319
00:28:08,307 --> 00:28:10,640
Aei! Who are you my son?

320
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,974
I'm Nobin Chandra Das.

321
00:28:12,974 --> 00:28:14,890
I work in the shop of Kalidas Indra.

322
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:17,557
Well and good!
But what do you want me to do?

323
00:28:17,557 --> 00:28:19,390
She ate sixteen sweets and …

324
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:20,515
Aei aei!

325
00:28:20,515 --> 00:28:21,599
Shut up!

326
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:23,682
Had sixteen sweets, you see!

327
00:28:23,682 --> 00:28:26,015
Didn't pay, isn't it?

328
00:28:26,015 --> 00:28:29,224
Wait! A good treat is waiting for you!

329
00:28:29,224 --> 00:28:31,599
Yes, my son!
How much is your bill?

330
00:28:31,599 --> 00:28:33,515
Quarter of an anna, mother!

331
00:28:33,515 --> 00:28:34,890
Take this, my son!

332
00:28:38,099 --> 00:28:42,099
Oi! Come to the room!
I'll give you a good lesson today!

333
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:49,182
Yamuna, are you the same
Yamuna that flows away?

334
00:28:49,182 --> 00:28:56,432
On whose shore of beauty sold
the most precious blue stone?

335
00:29:05,349 --> 00:29:08,265
Do you hold such performances
here regularly?

336
00:29:08,265 --> 00:29:09,974
Why do you ask?
Do you sing?

337
00:29:09,974 --> 00:29:13,015
No no no!
Sometimes I just play the khol.

338
00:29:13,557 --> 00:29:14,890
Is it?

339
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:17,474
Then please come one day.

340
00:29:17,474 --> 00:29:18,807
Play with me!

341
00:29:18,807 --> 00:29:21,182
I work in a shop!

342
00:29:21,182 --> 00:29:22,807
So it's difficult to find time.

343
00:29:22,807 --> 00:29:25,140
Whenever I find time,
I'll definitely come.

344
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:27,599
Be sure to come!

345
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:29,932
I'll wait for you with
thirsty eyes!

346
00:29:36,974 --> 00:29:39,515
Yamuna, are you the same
Yamuna that flows away?

347
00:29:41,265 --> 00:29:44,140
Are you a 'moira' (sweetmeat maker)
or a robber, eh?

348
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:45,765
I'm not a thief like you.
Me a thief?

349
00:29:45,765 --> 00:29:47,099
Cheating a good person like
my mother?

350
00:29:47,099 --> 00:29:48,432
Give the money.

351
00:29:48,432 --> 00:29:50,557
No! No! No!
Not the money!

352
00:29:51,349 --> 00:29:52,640
Oh! My father!

353
00:29:56,265 --> 00:29:58,224
Now I can make out...

354
00:29:58,224 --> 00:30:00,099
whatever you said to the palanquin
riders is absolutely true.

355
00:30:00,099 --> 00:30:02,307
Eh! Tall talker!

356
00:30:02,307 --> 00:30:04,765
Have come to take money for
those trashy sweets?

357
00:30:04,765 --> 00:30:07,849
Trashy sweets?
That's why you gobbled up 16 of them.

358
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:11,599
I was expecting a good one.

359
00:30:11,599 --> 00:30:14,182
Just look!
Please! Look here!

360
00:30:14,182 --> 00:30:16,390
I'm not taking your money.

361
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:18,349
You offer me a good sweet first...

362
00:30:18,349 --> 00:30:20,932
and I'll return your money.

363
00:30:20,932 --> 00:30:23,807
How do you expect your good
sweet to be?

364
00:30:24,807 --> 00:30:26,807
Good sweet...

365
00:30:27,432 --> 00:30:34,765
Not sticky, this sweet is a boon...
as bright as the moon!

366
00:30:34,765 --> 00:30:37,099
Filled with ras (sugar syrup),
delightfully soft...

367
00:30:37,099 --> 00:30:39,557
When put in the mouth makes people
forget their pains and sorrows.

368
00:30:39,557 --> 00:30:42,015
All people good and bad
will declare openly...

369
00:30:42,015 --> 00:30:44,765
It can't be found anywhere in the world...

370
00:30:44,765 --> 00:30:48,099
Want such a sweet from Nobin Moira!

371
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:54,224
So you can rhyme?

372
00:30:54,224 --> 00:30:57,057
Yes, if the sweet is not right,
I can also cut throats.

373
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:00,932
So, not sticky …

374
00:31:00,932 --> 00:31:01,974
Delightfully soft …

375
00:31:01,974 --> 00:31:04,057
Luminous white …

376
00:31:04,057 --> 00:31:06,307
Y…e…s … a ball of ras!

377
00:31:06,307 --> 00:31:08,349
Not to be found anywhere in the world.

378
00:31:08,349 --> 00:31:09,390
Will it happen?

379
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:12,224
Don't forget my money
for the sweets you had!

380
00:31:12,224 --> 00:31:14,349
It will...!

381
00:31:15,682 --> 00:31:17,349
It will...!

382
00:31:33,474 --> 00:31:35,390
Will it be possible?

383
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:37,140
It will!

384
00:31:41,515 --> 00:31:43,265
"Like the moon" … means round.

385
00:31:43,265 --> 00:31:45,015
"Luminous white" …

386
00:31:45,015 --> 00:31:47,599
So it can't be condensed milk …
Must be posset.

387
00:31:50,057 --> 00:31:52,765
See! I'll make a new sweetmeat!

388
00:31:52,765 --> 00:31:54,974
Just like this!

389
00:31:54,974 --> 00:31:56,890
A syrupy ball...

390
00:31:56,890 --> 00:31:58,224
A sweatmeat from snack?

391
00:31:58,224 --> 00:32:00,015
Ah! No!

392
00:32:00,015 --> 00:32:02,099
It'll be round like this.

393
00:32:02,099 --> 00:32:04,474
'Aam pana' (mango cordial),
'Kachauri pana' (water hyacinth)

394
00:32:04,474 --> 00:32:06,307
'Chand pana' (like the moon)

395
00:32:06,307 --> 00:32:07,849
A sweet from the moon?

396
00:32:07,849 --> 00:32:09,265
Who said that?

397
00:32:09,265 --> 00:32:11,015
From posset.

398
00:32:11,015 --> 00:32:16,224
Listen! Tomorrow morning
I need some posset and sugar.

399
00:32:16,224 --> 00:32:19,682
I'll give you posset, sugar… everything...
give me my snack back.

400
00:32:19,682 --> 00:32:21,099
Eat!

401
00:32:21,557 --> 00:32:22,974
Round balls!

402
00:32:34,307 --> 00:32:36,140
Ram! Ram!

403
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:32,265
Listen...

404
00:33:32,265 --> 00:33:34,057
Uh! Maheshdada!
Please let me think!

405
00:33:34,057 --> 00:33:36,140
It's not happening!

406
00:33:41,849 --> 00:33:45,640
Stop this nonsense!
If I've to talk every now and then …

407
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,099
What's being done?

408
00:33:47,099 --> 00:33:50,307
I'm mmmmmm …

409
00:33:50,307 --> 00:33:51,682
What are you?

410
00:33:51,682 --> 00:33:52,765
A ram?

411
00:33:52,765 --> 00:33:56,140
Trying to make a new mishti...

412
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:58,599
With only posset,

413
00:33:58,599 --> 00:34:00,765
Delicately soft...
Why only posset?

414
00:34:00,765 --> 00:34:03,515
If I use cream,
It'll not be soft.

415
00:34:03,515 --> 00:34:05,515
So, I thought of using posset...
How do you know?

416
00:34:05,515 --> 00:34:06,932
I know.

417
00:34:06,932 --> 00:34:09,099
That's why I was making balls …
You know?

418
00:34:09,099 --> 00:34:10,557
You know so much,
but it never occurred to you

419
00:34:10,557 --> 00:34:12,765
that posset, if not
fried cannot soak syrup?

420
00:34:12,765 --> 00:34:14,765
But when fried,
it will not remain white …

421
00:34:14,765 --> 00:34:17,307
That's why …
You know better than me?

422
00:34:17,307 --> 00:34:19,640
Better than even Bhim Nag?

423
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:23,224
Bhim Nag fried it to make
Lady Canning's sweet.

424
00:34:23,224 --> 00:34:27,015
A novice like you would have
spoiled it!

425
00:34:27,015 --> 00:34:28,265
I was trying it in a new way …

426
00:34:28,265 --> 00:34:29,599
New way … new way …

427
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:31,349
Will win the world
at the age of twenty!

428
00:34:31,349 --> 00:34:33,682
Young Bengal...!

429
00:34:33,682 --> 00:34:36,099
There is nothing to invent.
See what others are doing and copy it!

430
00:34:36,099 --> 00:34:37,390
Making new sweet!

431
00:34:37,390 --> 00:34:40,765
All over Bengal so many people
are trying so many new things …

432
00:34:40,765 --> 00:34:42,724
if we try to make a new mishti...

433
00:34:45,974 --> 00:34:49,390
Stealing my posset and talking tall?

434
00:34:50,807 --> 00:34:54,557
If I see any insolence
you'll be thrown out.

435
00:34:56,265 --> 00:34:58,015
Mahesh!
Babu!

436
00:34:58,015 --> 00:35:05,432
I don't need any novelty on jamai
shashthi, at the Dutta's of Bagbazar.

437
00:35:44,890 --> 00:35:47,640
Such a vast Ganga but
don't you find a place to throw your waste?

438
00:35:49,182 --> 00:35:51,432
I meant to call you up.

439
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:56,099
Hey! Don't you have anything to do?

440
00:35:56,099 --> 00:35:58,015
You said – "it'll happen".

441
00:35:58,015 --> 00:36:00,849
What will happen?
Syrupy ball or a frog head?

442
00:36:00,849 --> 00:36:02,807
When I've said it'll happen, it'll happen.

443
00:36:02,807 --> 00:36:04,349
– the syrupy ball.

444
00:36:04,349 --> 00:36:05,349
I'll not stop before I do it.

445
00:36:05,349 --> 00:36:09,099
Eh! As if you're a moving train!
Zik zik zik zik … won't stop!

446
00:36:09,099 --> 00:36:11,390
Stop it!
Why? Why should I?

447
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:14,307
A competent person is always at work.

448
00:36:14,307 --> 00:36:16,807
They do not waste time
in measuring Ganga water.

449
00:36:18,557 --> 00:36:20,015
What are you doing here?

450
00:36:20,015 --> 00:36:21,515
As if you've a lot of work!

451
00:36:21,515 --> 00:36:22,724
Then go!

452
00:36:22,724 --> 00:36:24,599
Climb the shaora tree!

453
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:28,099
Ok then! Feel the pinch!
A mad girl... a bad girl!

454
00:36:34,307 --> 00:36:36,849
Please don't throw!

455
00:36:36,849 --> 00:36:38,557
Forgive me!

456
00:36:40,932 --> 00:36:42,140
See how it feels!

457
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:43,140
Go!

458
00:36:45,307 --> 00:36:47,390
Oh! Saved!

459
00:36:48,099 --> 00:36:52,599
If your words are not sweet,
how will your hands make sweets?

460
00:36:52,599 --> 00:36:56,307
Is it the way to talk to girls?

461
00:36:57,099 --> 00:37:00,974
The 'moira' who doesn't
behave sweetly,

462
00:37:00,974 --> 00:37:03,349
can't make sweets!

463
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:09,932
Oh! Has understood everything
about sweets!

464
00:37:13,765 --> 00:37:15,599
Hey! Do you know that person?

465
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:20,224
He is the man who made
the sweet for Lady Canning!

466
00:37:20,224 --> 00:37:21,849
Bhim Nag?

467
00:38:07,349 --> 00:38:09,974
Rupo! Whom have you brought?

468
00:38:09,974 --> 00:38:12,307
He seems to be a young 'moira'!

469
00:38:12,307 --> 00:38:17,432
But Mahesh Moira said the new
sweets can only be made by him.

470
00:38:17,432 --> 00:38:19,182
Just give me one chance Madam...

471
00:38:19,182 --> 00:38:20,349
I'll definitely be able to make it!

472
00:38:20,349 --> 00:38:22,765
Ok, let's see!

473
00:38:22,765 --> 00:38:25,057
Rupo! Leave this room now...

474
00:38:25,057 --> 00:38:26,057
Ok!

475
00:38:26,057 --> 00:38:27,599
I've some important things to
discuss with him!

476
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:28,932
Ok!

477
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,682
I can't turn my head repeatedly
to talk to you!

478
00:38:32,682 --> 00:38:34,140
Come in front of me!

479
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:36,474
Yes! … Yes Madam!

480
00:38:41,807 --> 00:38:43,640
I've three son-in-laws.

481
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:46,307
You'll have to make sweet for them.

482
00:38:46,307 --> 00:38:48,099
Can you?

483
00:38:48,099 --> 00:38:51,432
Don't nod your head at the very outset.
Listen to me first!

484
00:38:51,432 --> 00:38:54,474
All my son-in-laws are arrogant!

485
00:38:54,474 --> 00:38:56,724
The eldest is an addict.

486
00:38:56,724 --> 00:38:59,474
He wastes the whole day
away with his friends.

487
00:38:59,474 --> 00:39:00,682
Opium … hashish …

488
00:39:00,682 --> 00:39:03,224
Doesn't pay heed to requests
by even his father-in-law.

489
00:39:03,224 --> 00:39:07,890
Today is occasion.
Even today he has brought those along.

490
00:39:07,890 --> 00:39:10,807
The next one always hobnobs
with the Europeans.

491
00:39:10,807 --> 00:39:12,640
He has become almost a sahib.

492
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,057
Our preparations do not suit his palate.

493
00:39:15,057 --> 00:39:18,432
Non-Hindu dishes are his most favourite.

494
00:39:18,432 --> 00:39:22,307
And the youngest spends the whole day
reading, writing and studying newspapers.

495
00:39:22,307 --> 00:39:26,224
Studying a few books he thinks
he's brought the world under his control.

496
00:39:26,224 --> 00:39:29,015
You'll have to outwit all of them.

497
00:39:29,015 --> 00:39:30,307
Can you do it?

498
00:39:30,307 --> 00:39:31,807
Outwit?

499
00:39:32,765 --> 00:39:33,390
Me?

500
00:39:34,974 --> 00:39:36,640
No Madam!

501
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:39,640
Actually I couldn't continue my studies.

502
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,849
My father died before I was born.

503
00:39:41,849 --> 00:39:42,849
And my mother alone …

504
00:39:42,849 --> 00:39:46,849
Ah! Did I ask you to engage in a
rhyming competition with them?

505
00:39:47,932 --> 00:39:52,057
You'll have to make a sweet that
will outwit them.

506
00:39:52,057 --> 00:39:55,807
Make such a sweetmeat
that even if they are amazed...

507
00:39:55,807 --> 00:39:57,807
cannot blame you.

508
00:39:57,807 --> 00:39:59,682
Is it possible?

509
00:39:59,682 --> 00:40:00,599
It is...

510
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:02,849
Your face doesn't indicate it'll happen.

511
00:40:02,849 --> 00:40:04,890
It will for sure.

512
00:40:04,890 --> 00:40:07,349
I'll tell you one thing.

513
00:40:07,349 --> 00:40:11,640
I wont give you more than
an anna for each sweet.

514
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:15,057
Whatever price Kalibabu might
ask for them.

515
00:40:23,182 --> 00:40:25,182
Sugar...

516
00:40:25,182 --> 00:40:26,890
posset...

517
00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:29,140
cream...

518
00:40:29,890 --> 00:40:32,015
...will they supply here?

519
00:40:33,432 --> 00:40:34,932
No... no no!

520
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:37,265
Then go! Make it!

521
00:40:45,932 --> 00:40:49,265
Nobin! Make some sweet …

522
00:40:49,265 --> 00:40:51,474
O my God!

523
00:40:51,474 --> 00:40:54,640
Haven't made a single
thing as yet! What are you thinking?

524
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,265
Have to outwit them.

525
00:40:56,265 --> 00:40:57,265
Outwit?

526
00:40:58,765 --> 00:41:01,640
Are you mad or what?

527
00:41:05,557 --> 00:41:10,474
This palmyra kernel,
always drenches you!

528
00:41:15,265 --> 00:41:17,140
Hey! What has happened?

529
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:18,515
Got it! Got it!
What?

530
00:41:18,515 --> 00:41:20,640
Got it! Got it! Got it!

531
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,515
Listen!

532
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,224
Bring me 50 mangoes.
Mango?

533
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:25,807
As many as you can.
From wherever you can.

534
00:41:25,807 --> 00:41:27,307
Ripe mango, green mango,
hanging from the tree, dropped on the floor.

535
00:41:27,307 --> 00:41:28,349
Bring them all.

536
00:41:28,349 --> 00:41:29,224
And Keshar...

537
00:41:32,599 --> 00:41:33,890
Brother Chondu!

538
00:41:35,682 --> 00:41:38,349
Do you see the same thing
that I see?

539
00:41:38,349 --> 00:41:39,515
Yes...!

540
00:41:41,099 --> 00:41:43,474
I see...

541
00:41:43,474 --> 00:41:44,974
...a fruit in a sweetmeat.

542
00:41:47,557 --> 00:41:49,099
Me too.

543
00:41:49,099 --> 00:41:51,474
'Aam sandesh'...
(mango desert).

544
00:41:54,932 --> 00:41:58,140
What a mishti I had at
Mr. Maxwell's place!

545
00:42:00,807 --> 00:42:04,974
From the very look of it,
it is quite evident that...

546
00:42:04,974 --> 00:42:06,974
this sweet has been prepared in
an unhygienic process.

547
00:42:08,307 --> 00:42:10,349
Not fit for consumption.

548
00:42:10,976 --> 00:42:14,807
An article by me on this was published
in Amrito uncle's magazine …

549
00:42:14,807 --> 00:42:18,682
Why do you preach
wisdom while eating?

550
00:42:19,390 --> 00:42:22,432
Listen my dear!
I'm giving you a clear warning!

551
00:42:22,432 --> 00:42:25,390
If I find this sweet to be
of inferior quality,

552
00:42:25,390 --> 00:42:29,599
I'll hang you from the pole of charak...
with fire leaping up from below to catch you.

553
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:32,807
You at least test one...

554
00:42:32,807 --> 00:42:35,765
If you find it unworthy,
punish me!

555
00:43:07,724 --> 00:43:10,974
Have it my dear! Have it!

556
00:43:23,890 --> 00:43:26,307
You've real talent, brother!

557
00:43:33,974 --> 00:43:35,682
How old are you?

558
00:43:35,682 --> 00:43:37,515
What's your name?

559
00:43:37,515 --> 00:43:38,599
Twenty.

560
00:43:38,599 --> 00:43:39,849
My name is Nobin.

561
00:43:39,849 --> 00:43:44,265
N…o…b…I…n (young)!
You're still a teenager!

562
00:43:44,265 --> 00:43:47,474
Moustache has just started appearing!

563
00:43:47,474 --> 00:43:50,140
Such talent at this tender age!

564
00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:52,015
Amazing! Wonderful!

565
00:43:52,015 --> 00:43:53,182
Delicious!

566
00:43:53,182 --> 00:43:56,349
You had almost started
a tumult in my palate!

567
00:43:58,015 --> 00:43:59,099
Absolutely!

568
00:43:59,099 --> 00:44:02,474
As if Malkanjaan has started
performing on my tongue!

569
00:44:03,432 --> 00:44:06,932
I am not leaving you!

570
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:09,182
Come... come!

571
00:44:12,182 --> 00:44:15,599
Let me extend my good wishes to you!

572
00:44:20,390 --> 00:44:22,140
Leave him...

573
00:44:23,057 --> 00:44:24,640
One anna!

574
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:26,724
You mean to say this mishti
costs one anna?

575
00:44:26,724 --> 00:44:29,349
Will you force me to shut down
my shop?

576
00:44:29,349 --> 00:44:31,224
Do you do it intentionally?

577
00:44:31,224 --> 00:44:33,224
Or you are short of
practical understanding?

578
00:44:33,224 --> 00:44:35,557
Or are you craving for claps
like the theatre artists?

579
00:44:35,557 --> 00:44:37,474
No!

580
00:44:37,474 --> 00:44:38,890
Actually Madam ordered me …

581
00:44:38,890 --> 00:44:42,099
and you jumped off with this...

582
00:44:42,099 --> 00:44:44,807
couldn't you say it's costlier to make?

583
00:44:44,807 --> 00:44:46,599
I … mmm …

584
00:44:47,765 --> 00:44:51,432
You talk so much
while arguing with elders...

585
00:44:51,432 --> 00:44:56,349
Now have to answer.
Cannot keep mum!

586
00:44:56,349 --> 00:44:59,515
How will you pay back?
We'll not give a farthing!

587
00:44:59,515 --> 00:45:01,682
I apologize!

588
00:45:01,682 --> 00:45:04,765
Might have misunderstood
what he was told.

589
00:45:05,124 --> 00:45:06,932
Pardon him for once!

590
00:45:06,932 --> 00:45:10,099
Pardon me sister!

591
00:45:10,099 --> 00:45:12,182
I took him only on
Reba's recommendation.

592
00:45:12,182 --> 00:45:14,140
I can't stand him any more!

593
00:45:14,140 --> 00:45:16,557
For his innovations my
age old shop will go to the docks?

594
00:45:16,557 --> 00:45:20,182
Now realize whom you've taken!

595
00:45:20,182 --> 00:45:22,015
He was born with an ill omen.

596
00:45:22,015 --> 00:45:24,182
Finished his father
before he was born …

597
00:45:24,182 --> 00:45:25,974
now he is out to finish you.

598
00:45:27,849 --> 00:45:29,182
Showing red eyes, eh?

599
00:45:31,474 --> 00:45:34,265
Will you be able to pay
back his money?

600
00:45:34,265 --> 00:45:36,140
Do you have that capacity?

601
00:45:41,849 --> 00:45:43,807
Ma?

602
00:46:01,474 --> 00:46:02,807
Give it!

603
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:05,849
Take it!

604
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:10,890
You've done a lot for me!

605
00:46:10,890 --> 00:46:12,724
Won't need any further help from you!

606
00:46:14,557 --> 00:46:15,890
Thanks!

607
00:46:18,224 --> 00:46:19,515
God bless!

608
00:46:26,432 --> 00:46:28,390
Such arrogance!

609
00:46:28,390 --> 00:46:30,724
So you don't need any
help, isn't it?

610
00:46:30,724 --> 00:46:33,599
I give you seven days' time to leave
this house for good!

611
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:34,557
Seven days!

612
00:46:36,015 --> 00:46:37,057
Ok!

613
00:46:45,474 --> 00:46:50,474
No! There's no scope here!
My workers are all experienced!

614
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:55,057
My work is not possible with
young workers like you.

615
00:47:15,765 --> 00:47:18,390
What a pity!

616
00:47:18,390 --> 00:47:22,057
Collecting leaves from the wild
at this age!

617
00:47:22,057 --> 00:47:25,849
What else can you do with
a frenzied son like him?

618
00:47:25,849 --> 00:47:28,265
You can send him to our house.

619
00:47:28,265 --> 00:47:31,224
He will get some money
by weeding the garden.

620
00:47:31,224 --> 00:47:34,807
He has such a good physique.
Let him exercise it a little!

621
00:47:34,807 --> 00:47:36,224
My husband was saying...

622
00:47:36,224 --> 00:47:38,474
Nobin has started working as
a tabadi (night soil carrier).

623
00:47:38,474 --> 00:47:41,140
Eh! My my! Fetid smell of shit!

624
00:47:42,849 --> 00:47:44,974
Come! Let's go!

625
00:47:46,890 --> 00:47:50,599
When he made sweets, did he do it
with hands soiled with shit?

626
00:47:50,599 --> 00:47:52,974
How do I know?
May be he did!

627
00:48:21,390 --> 00:48:26,099
What other things will you do
to disgrace me?

628
00:48:26,099 --> 00:48:29,015
Kill me! Just kill me!

629
00:48:29,015 --> 00:48:31,474
What can I do?

630
00:48:31,474 --> 00:48:35,307
Indrababu has slandered in
my name in such a way

631
00:48:35,307 --> 00:48:38,140
that no one is willing to appoint me.

632
00:48:39,515 --> 00:48:43,890
If I can't earn in these 7 days,
where shall we go ma?

633
00:48:43,890 --> 00:48:45,599
We'll live on the street,

634
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:48,932
take shelter in Gosaipara's temple,

635
00:48:48,932 --> 00:48:53,182
if you wanted to become a sweet maker,
you'll become and nothing else.

636
00:48:53,182 --> 00:48:57,432
One who endures, he wins,
my son!

637
00:48:57,432 --> 00:49:01,974
How much more do I have to
endure ma?

638
00:49:04,599 --> 00:49:07,140
How much more will I endure?

639
00:49:09,807 --> 00:49:12,849
At first I've to live...

640
00:49:13,557 --> 00:49:16,349
...then only can I become
a sweet maker!

641
00:49:16,974 --> 00:49:19,724
When the time is good,

642
00:49:19,724 --> 00:49:22,057
When the sun shines brightly,

643
00:49:22,057 --> 00:49:25,474
It's easy for anyone to be courageous!

644
00:49:27,765 --> 00:49:28,890
But when...

645
00:49:31,349 --> 00:49:33,432
clouds cover the sky,

646
00:49:34,432 --> 00:49:36,557
When the thunder squall rages...

647
00:49:37,724 --> 00:49:41,015
then you need to have confidence!

648
00:49:43,182 --> 00:49:46,182
Have confidence in yourself, my son!

649
00:49:47,015 --> 00:49:50,432
I've confidence in you!

650
00:50:15,890 --> 00:50:18,682
What's this gosain …
what has happened today …

651
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:20,349
Your hands are failing to catch the rhythm?

652
00:50:20,349 --> 00:50:23,515
My hands aren't catching
the rhythm...

653
00:50:23,515 --> 00:50:26,432
My mishtis aren't getting round …

654
00:50:26,432 --> 00:50:27,599
… uh!

655
00:50:28,974 --> 00:50:31,265
None of you are listening to me!

656
00:51:07,182 --> 00:51:08,807
Nobin!

657
00:51:12,849 --> 00:51:14,474
Oh Nobin!

658
00:51:14,849 --> 00:51:16,182
Hey … Nobin!

659
00:51:23,182 --> 00:51:26,599
Feasting your eyes,
but what about the belly?

660
00:51:26,599 --> 00:51:28,307
But...

661
00:51:28,307 --> 00:51:29,932
...tell me where is work?

662
00:51:29,932 --> 00:51:32,557
Work? It's here.

663
00:51:32,557 --> 00:51:35,140
Will you be my partner?

664
00:51:35,140 --> 00:51:36,974
What...?

665
00:51:36,974 --> 00:51:40,765
No no.
It's partner.

666
00:51:42,015 --> 00:51:46,015
I've an empty shop in Jorashanko.

667
00:51:46,015 --> 00:51:49,890
The magic of your hands...
and my money.

668
00:51:49,890 --> 00:51:51,015
Agreed?

669
00:51:51,015 --> 00:51:52,224
O yes!

670
00:51:52,224 --> 00:51:54,599
From now on, I'll also join you.

671
00:51:54,599 --> 00:51:57,057
What are you saying Maheshdada?

672
00:51:57,057 --> 00:51:58,765
Enough of copying!

673
00:51:58,765 --> 00:52:03,890
Then from today,
our partnership starts.

674
00:52:03,890 --> 00:52:07,182
Come! Let me give my good wishes!

675
00:52:21,057 --> 00:52:23,182
Bishnu! Who are these people?

676
00:52:42,265 --> 00:52:48,807
Pitter patter rings the rain
on the watercolour painting...

677
00:52:48,807 --> 00:52:55,140
You're my only sky in
the shade of a pastoral tune.

678
00:52:58,349 --> 00:53:05,015
Multi coloured glass bangles,
faces of seven shades

679
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:13,849
Your face veils the happiness
of the entire life.

680
00:53:13,849 --> 00:53:21,182
When shimul palash will be shed
on the way, and wind sway the heart...

681
00:53:21,182 --> 00:53:27,349
Then we two will live happily
keeping the oath alive in our hearts.

682
00:53:40,682 --> 00:53:47,140
I'll sing the same tune
targeted at your eyes.

683
00:54:16,140 --> 00:54:22,724
How did it happen
what never happened before...

684
00:54:22,724 --> 00:54:28,849
As if the waves of a river
splash on my heart.

685
00:54:42,099 --> 00:54:45,224
My dear friend...

686
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:53,932
My dear friend,
my life is in your hands!

687
00:55:31,599 --> 00:55:35,557
What's the matter?
Why all this peeping and prying?

688
00:55:35,557 --> 00:55:40,640
No no! I just went there …
then came here …

689
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:42,890
Don't feign innocence!

690
00:55:42,890 --> 00:55:44,224
I've seen everything!

691
00:55:44,224 --> 00:55:46,224
Following me for the last one year?

692
00:55:46,224 --> 00:55:49,182
Wherever I go,
you appear from nowhere.

693
00:55:49,182 --> 00:55:51,099
Pursuing me at every step like a cat!

694
00:55:51,099 --> 00:55:53,849
What's your intention?

695
00:55:55,974 --> 00:55:58,807
I'll make the sweet...

696
00:55:59,224 --> 00:56:01,765
but where shall I find you?

697
00:56:02,974 --> 00:56:05,015
See this crumbling house,

698
00:56:05,015 --> 00:56:07,015
where I play hide and seek...

699
00:56:07,015 --> 00:56:09,807
and where you follow to
play hide and seek with me.

700
00:56:09,807 --> 00:56:12,265
Come here and call my name aloud

701
00:56:12,265 --> 00:56:16,057
You'll find me dropping in front of you.
Like the spirit of the sheora tree.

702
00:56:22,265 --> 00:56:25,099
If I do not find you...?

703
00:56:28,224 --> 00:56:30,182
You will.

704
00:56:30,890 --> 00:56:33,265
I'll get my moon-like sweet...

705
00:56:34,390 --> 00:56:37,140
And you'll get your Khirod!

706
00:56:41,515 --> 00:56:43,765
Will I get it?

707
00:56:46,474 --> 00:56:48,265
Will happen!

708
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:52,099
It'll happen!

709
00:56:54,515 --> 00:56:57,390
Happen it will!
It will happen!

710
00:56:57,390 --> 00:56:59,515
Please do not worry!

711
00:56:59,515 --> 00:57:03,015
Your son's marriage is like
a function in our house!

712
00:57:03,015 --> 00:57:04,349
Leave all responsibilities to us!

713
00:57:27,015 --> 00:57:29,140
Nobinkishore!

714
00:57:29,140 --> 00:57:31,474
I'm going to pack my lungs …

715
00:57:31,474 --> 00:57:33,140
With fresh air!

716
00:57:36,849 --> 00:57:38,807
See!

717
00:57:38,807 --> 00:57:40,849
They're broken again!

718
00:57:40,849 --> 00:57:43,390
It is impossible Nobin!

719
00:57:51,140 --> 00:57:53,182
Good heavens! What's that?

720
00:57:53,182 --> 00:57:55,432
That's nothing! Nothing!

721
00:57:55,432 --> 00:57:56,849
Please continue.

722
00:57:56,849 --> 00:58:00,599
Bishtu!
Give the chewing tobacco!

723
00:58:00,599 --> 00:58:03,515
Don't regret afterwards!

724
00:58:03,515 --> 00:58:05,849
Your daughter is nearing sixteen.

725
00:58:05,849 --> 00:58:08,099
You'll not be able to arrange
her marriage after this!

726
00:58:09,890 --> 00:58:12,807
No ma! I'll not marry!

727
00:58:12,807 --> 00:58:16,182
Given my word!
Have to make a thing.

728
00:58:16,182 --> 00:58:18,682
I've not asked you anything!

729
00:58:18,682 --> 00:58:21,807
You've to follow my order and marry!

730
00:58:21,807 --> 00:58:25,640
Very wisely I and Khentidi have
decided this for you!

731
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:29,057
They don't interfere in others' affairs.

732
00:58:29,057 --> 00:58:36,349
Listen! Your wayward daughter
cannot adjust with others.

733
00:58:36,349 --> 00:58:39,015
Here there's only the husband
and the mother-in-law!

734
00:58:41,765 --> 00:58:43,640
It's nothing! It's nothing!

735
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:46,474
Have rented a house in Chitpur!

736
00:58:46,474 --> 00:58:47,974
You've a liking for music!

737
00:58:47,974 --> 00:58:50,765
For over seven generations,
they've been steeped in music.

738
00:58:50,765 --> 00:58:55,724
Has opened a shop all by himself.
Gradually, he'll organize everything!

739
00:58:55,724 --> 00:58:59,224
Moreover, both your family
and theirs are 'moiras'!

740
00:58:59,224 --> 00:58:59,974
Khentididi!

741
00:58:59,974 --> 00:59:01,765
What's the name of the boy?

742
00:59:01,765 --> 00:59:03,224
Nobin Chandra...

743
00:59:03,224 --> 00:59:04,807
...Das!

744
00:59:04,807 --> 00:59:06,432
What?

745
00:59:08,849 --> 00:59:10,224
Do you know?

746
00:59:10,224 --> 00:59:12,390
She's the granddaughter of Bhola Moira!

747
00:59:23,765 --> 00:59:27,974
The divine couple have
met each other...

748
00:59:27,974 --> 00:59:32,640
Behold!
Rai stands on the left of Shyam.

749
00:59:43,182 --> 00:59:50,599
When Rai had Kanu,
happiness flooded her...

750
00:59:57,057 --> 01:00:02,557
Behold!
Rai stands on the left of Shyam.

751
01:00:19,724 --> 01:00:22,099
Oh! Ho! It's you?

752
01:00:25,765 --> 01:00:27,390
Hey stop! Stand there!

753
01:00:29,265 --> 01:00:31,140
Hey you've become very naughty!

754
01:00:31,140 --> 01:00:33,640
To bring you here
has been my greatest mistake!

755
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:35,640
Come on! Go out!

756
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:38,015
Don't pester me any more!
I'm married now?

757
01:00:38,015 --> 01:00:39,599
Go!

758
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:50,307
Oh!

759
01:00:50,307 --> 01:00:52,557
Please bring me the sugar!

760
01:00:52,557 --> 01:00:54,265
Give it to me!

761
01:00:58,724 --> 01:01:00,557
Open the lid!

762
01:01:23,932 --> 01:01:25,765
Work and then you'll know the hassle.

763
01:01:25,765 --> 01:01:27,599
I'll work also?

764
01:01:27,599 --> 01:01:29,390
Why not?

765
01:01:29,390 --> 01:01:32,515
I'm sweet maker...
and you're my wife!

766
01:01:59,140 --> 01:02:01,765
Alack!

767
01:02:01,765 --> 01:02:03,932
What do I see here? Eh!

768
01:02:04,849 --> 01:02:07,099
Son! Son!

769
01:02:09,099 --> 01:02:11,515
Round balls! R..round!

770
01:02:11,515 --> 01:02:14,265
Last night also you made those balls!

771
01:02:14,265 --> 01:02:17,765
Lay here the whole night with her?

772
01:02:17,765 --> 01:02:19,557
You made her work through
the night, isn't it?

773
01:02:19,557 --> 01:02:21,265
Ma, tell her who didn't sleep
in the proper place.

774
01:02:21,265 --> 01:02:22,974
I don't need a separate resting place.

775
01:02:22,974 --> 01:02:24,724
No mother!

776
01:02:24,724 --> 01:02:25,974
I had no problem.

777
01:02:25,974 --> 01:02:28,265
You don't poke your nose into this!

778
01:02:28,265 --> 01:02:30,390
Don't pamper him any more!

779
01:02:30,390 --> 01:02:32,140
My pampering has turned him
into a monkey!

780
01:02:32,140 --> 01:02:33,807
Son! Listen carefully!

781
01:02:33,807 --> 01:02:35,807
When you've married, you'll
have to take all responsibilities!

782
01:02:35,807 --> 01:02:37,099
I didn't want to marry …

783
01:02:37,099 --> 01:02:38,015
What?

784
01:02:38,849 --> 01:02:41,765
My first priority is my sweet,
then comes the rest.

785
01:02:41,765 --> 01:02:45,349
Used to follow me everywhere,
and now he says he didn't want to marry!

786
01:02:45,349 --> 01:02:46,640
Liar!

787
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:48,932
Son...

788
01:02:48,932 --> 01:02:50,724
you followed her?

789
01:02:50,724 --> 01:02:51,890
No ma!

790
01:02:51,890 --> 01:02:54,140
What no? For whom are you
making this sweet, eh?

791
01:02:54,140 --> 01:02:55,515
You are making it for her?

792
01:02:55,515 --> 01:02:56,932
No ma!

793
01:02:56,932 --> 01:02:58,140
That sweet will never happen!

794
01:02:58,140 --> 01:03:00,265
Can't make sweet … he can
only make fool of others!

795
01:03:00,265 --> 01:03:01,932
Only tall talks!

796
01:03:01,932 --> 01:03:04,015
I know how far you can go!

797
01:03:04,015 --> 01:03:07,599
Need not make syrupy ball,
rather try to make horse eggs!

798
01:03:07,599 --> 01:03:09,182
Is that it?

799
01:03:09,182 --> 01:03:10,515
All right!

800
01:03:10,515 --> 01:03:13,015
Unless I make that mishti,
I'll not enter the house…

801
01:03:13,015 --> 01:03:16,265
not even step on your shadow.
Wicked girl … telling all lies!

802
01:03:18,890 --> 01:03:20,182
What can I say Master...

803
01:03:20,182 --> 01:03:24,015
if I had known about
the whereabouts of the owner …

804
01:03:24,015 --> 01:03:26,390
Who is Chondu?
I'm the owner!

805
01:03:26,390 --> 01:03:30,224
You'll be mistaken if you think
you'll get away with such lame excuses …

806
01:03:30,224 --> 01:03:32,765
I'll throw you all in jail …
I'll take back my shop …

807
01:03:32,765 --> 01:03:34,974
Then I'll see which Gauri Sen
comes to save you!

808
01:03:34,974 --> 01:03:36,932
Chondu...

809
01:03:39,015 --> 01:03:41,640
Listen! I'm giving you seven days' time!

810
01:03:41,640 --> 01:03:46,474
If I do not get the arrear rent within
that time, then see what I can do!

811
01:03:46,474 --> 01:03:49,557
Do you know sir, in good faith
I had given this shop on rent

812
01:03:49,557 --> 01:03:53,140
Spent one and a half years
without paying rent.

813
01:03:53,140 --> 01:03:55,557
So you're great swindlers!

814
01:03:55,557 --> 01:03:59,015
It has been a month since
I made the advance …

815
01:03:59,015 --> 01:04:00,932
Where's the new mishti?
Where is it?

816
01:04:00,932 --> 01:04:03,182
By chance I came to see
a day before the function …

817
01:04:03,182 --> 01:04:06,682
That advance was also
taken by Chondu babu!

818
01:04:06,682 --> 01:04:08,599
Hell with your Chondu babu!

819
01:04:08,599 --> 01:04:11,099
This is the mishti for my son's marriage!

820
01:04:11,099 --> 01:04:14,182
My son will not marry ten times!

821
01:04:14,182 --> 01:04:16,682
Tomorrow if the mishti doesn't reach on time,

822
01:04:16,682 --> 01:04:22,265
I'll hire goons
to destroy your shop.

823
01:04:22,265 --> 01:04:25,724
Catch them!
Put them under pressure!

824
01:04:43,974 --> 01:04:54,932
Oh beloved... don't tease me
in this tender age!

825
01:05:09,932 --> 01:05:15,724
Please leave my hand
and let me go!

826
01:05:30,390 --> 01:05:38,390
O dear! Nobody is aware of
his intension...

827
01:05:38,390 --> 01:05:47,682
How can one be lost
in this direction?

828
01:05:47,682 --> 01:05:58,057
Beauty is not to be maligned
in public observance.

829
01:05:58,057 --> 01:06:08,057
Behold her beauty to admire her
from a distance.

830
01:06:08,807 --> 01:06:14,474
Please listen to
me, my beloved...

831
01:06:18,057 --> 01:06:26,140
Don't tease her in this tender age.

832
01:07:01,724 --> 01:07:04,557
Great! What a performance!

833
01:07:10,932 --> 01:07:13,765
What a surprise!

834
01:07:13,765 --> 01:07:17,974
'Aam sandesh' sir!
What makes you come here?

835
01:07:20,599 --> 01:07:23,724
You! You too!

836
01:07:25,765 --> 01:07:28,182
Come on! Get up!

837
01:07:28,182 --> 01:07:29,182
No!

838
01:07:31,015 --> 01:07:33,265
Why are you pulling me?

839
01:07:33,265 --> 01:07:35,265
Slowly! Careful!

840
01:07:35,265 --> 01:07:37,182
Leave this joint and come home!

841
01:07:37,182 --> 01:07:38,807
Leave me!

842
01:07:39,265 --> 01:07:41,890
Already taken the advance
for making the new sweet!

843
01:07:41,890 --> 01:07:43,682
How do I do it?
Where's the money?

844
01:07:43,682 --> 01:07:47,890
Money is opium, opium money!

845
01:07:50,932 --> 01:07:52,307
The shop-owner had come … said...

846
01:07:52,307 --> 01:07:54,974
if we can't pay the rent within
7 days, he'll close down the shop.

847
01:07:54,974 --> 01:07:56,099
Let him close down!

848
01:07:56,099 --> 01:07:58,390
What do you mean? What shall
we do without the shop?

849
01:07:58,390 --> 01:08:01,640
Only if we can make that new mishti,
the shop will get saved

850
01:08:01,640 --> 01:08:04,599
… you'll be saved … I'll be saved!

851
01:08:04,599 --> 01:08:06,015
Try to understand!

852
01:08:07,265 --> 01:08:09,974
How many more people
do you like to ruin?

853
01:08:11,682 --> 01:08:14,390
He is Nobin Kishore.

854
01:08:14,390 --> 01:08:17,307
Makes very good mishti.

855
01:08:17,307 --> 01:08:20,974
And you, for your addictions,
make fool of others!

856
01:08:24,140 --> 01:08:25,432
How much is required?

857
01:08:30,057 --> 01:08:31,724
Tell me, how much is required?

858
01:08:31,724 --> 01:08:33,890
No … I …

859
01:08:36,599 --> 01:08:38,307
Two rupees.

860
01:08:41,515 --> 01:08:45,140
I beg your pardon for the break
in the performance.

861
01:08:45,140 --> 01:08:46,807
That's all right!

862
01:08:46,807 --> 01:08:51,349
Your Malkanjaan will be back
very soon.

863
01:08:58,307 --> 01:08:59,724
Why will you give?

864
01:08:59,724 --> 01:09:05,099
Take it as my wish or my choice …

865
01:09:05,099 --> 01:09:08,349
Many homes have got devastated for me...

866
01:09:08,349 --> 01:09:14,515
Today, if not home,
let someone's shop be established!

867
01:09:15,390 --> 01:09:16,849
You …

868
01:09:16,849 --> 01:09:18,599
Don't make me talk too much!

869
01:09:18,763 --> 01:09:22,096
My voice is very precious!

870
01:09:24,182 --> 01:09:25,015
Take this!

871
01:09:27,015 --> 01:09:29,099
I say... take this!

872
01:09:31,091 --> 01:09:33,974
Whenever I get an opportunity,
I'll return your money, my sister!

873
01:09:42,182 --> 01:09:43,849
Go!

874
01:09:49,638 --> 01:09:52,057
Leave me please!
Come with me silently!

875
01:09:52,057 --> 01:09:53,765
My head is spinning!
Don't pull me like that.

876
01:10:01,747 --> 01:10:04,015
Hey! What are you doing?

877
01:10:04,177 --> 01:10:05,911
Go at a distance! Go!

878
01:10:05,958 --> 01:10:07,458
See what's happening here!

879
01:10:07,458 --> 01:10:10,208
Is it possible to stand
here in smoke and dust?

880
01:10:11,122 --> 01:10:12,864
You've taken money...
do you remember?

881
01:10:13,021 --> 01:10:15,938
Now take the responsibility...
Zamindari?

882
01:10:15,938 --> 01:10:23,296
Talk softly. Go and get some saffron,
pistachio, currant … and some mango leather.

883
01:10:23,380 --> 01:10:25,380
This is our last attempt.

884
01:10:25,380 --> 01:10:28,255
How do stay in this smoke and dust?

885
01:10:29,338 --> 01:10:31,047
Tell me.

886
01:10:31,956 --> 01:10:34,073
I'm Amritalal Banik.

887
01:10:34,175 --> 01:10:36,634
My name is Mahesh. So what?

888
01:10:36,634 --> 01:10:39,143
Sweet! But I want to
talk to Nobinbabu!

889
01:10:39,227 --> 01:10:40,588
Say that!

890
01:10:40,672 --> 01:10:44,878
Nobin! See who has
come to talk with you!

891
01:10:44,962 --> 01:10:46,962
Coming!

892
01:10:47,592 --> 01:10:49,675
Take! Hold it!

893
01:10:50,217 --> 01:10:53,217
Me? What a problem!

894
01:10:54,776 --> 01:10:56,026
Welcome!

895
01:10:56,110 --> 01:10:57,152
Why are you standing here?

896
01:10:57,342 --> 01:10:59,842
Please go quickly!
It's getting late!

897
01:11:26,300 --> 01:11:28,509
The new mishti that you're preparing …

898
01:11:28,509 --> 01:11:32,634
It's being made… it'll happen…
don't worry… I'll send it …

899
01:11:32,634 --> 01:11:34,190
No, no I'm not asking you to send it …

900
01:11:34,274 --> 01:11:37,092
I'm talking of the right that
you have on the new mishti …

901
01:11:37,092 --> 01:11:39,050
Rights and mights may
be discussed later …

902
01:11:39,050 --> 01:11:40,925
If I'm late everything
will go to the dogs …

903
01:11:40,925 --> 01:11:44,050
Later I'll let you have
whatever I make...

904
01:11:45,526 --> 01:11:46,693
Sweet!

905
01:11:49,693 --> 01:11:51,693
What?

906
01:12:24,859 --> 01:12:26,193
Please have it!

907
01:12:28,151 --> 01:12:29,776
Take one more!

908
01:13:02,943 --> 01:13:05,318
New sweet!

909
01:13:05,318 --> 01:13:06,401
Have come here to kill people?

910
01:13:06,401 --> 01:13:10,151
See what you've done!

911
01:13:10,151 --> 01:13:12,318
Beat him! Punch him!

912
01:13:21,443 --> 01:13:23,026
Beat both of them!

913
01:13:55,818 --> 01:13:57,234
Maheshdada!

914
01:13:58,026 --> 01:14:00,109
I'll not make sweet any more!

915
01:14:01,901 --> 01:14:03,901
Never!

916
01:14:19,730 --> 01:14:22,813
Hey! Please listen to my words!

917
01:14:24,022 --> 01:14:26,230
Oh Nobin!

918
01:14:29,355 --> 01:14:32,063
Look maa ji,
how many days have passed …

919
01:14:32,063 --> 01:14:35,355
he's kept himself confined in his room.

920
01:14:35,355 --> 01:14:38,355
Why don't you convince him a little?

921
01:14:38,355 --> 01:14:39,647
How much more should I say?

922
01:14:39,647 --> 01:14:42,313
Does he ever listen to anybody?

923
01:14:42,313 --> 01:14:44,855
Hey child, why don't you
say something to him?

924
01:14:44,855 --> 01:14:47,647
What will she say?

925
01:14:47,647 --> 01:14:51,438
The boy who loves to work
is not even stepping out...

926
01:14:51,438 --> 01:14:53,855
...does she really care?

927
01:14:53,855 --> 01:14:56,647
In our times, if the husband's
body was warm,

928
01:14:56,647 --> 01:14:58,563
it caused blisters on the wife's body.

929
01:14:58,563 --> 01:15:01,105
Now-a-days they don't even care a fig.

930
01:15:01,105 --> 01:15:03,230
What kind of
daughter-in-law have I brought!

931
01:15:03,230 --> 01:15:04,855
Oh! She's just a little girl …!

932
01:15:04,855 --> 01:15:06,022
Little girl?

933
01:15:06,022 --> 01:15:10,605
I was married at nine.
At her age Nobin was already born.

934
01:15:10,605 --> 01:15:12,563
Little? Huh!

935
01:15:12,563 --> 01:15:15,688
All the time she
speaks a lot...

936
01:15:15,688 --> 01:15:19,105
If I knew this,
I would not bring her home!

937
01:15:21,688 --> 01:15:23,438
Aha! No! No!

938
01:15:24,063 --> 01:15:25,980
Look!

939
01:15:34,563 --> 01:15:35,730
Eh Nobin!

940
01:15:38,522 --> 01:15:41,605
What kind of a husband are you?

941
01:15:42,855 --> 01:15:44,438
Get up please!

942
01:15:47,647 --> 01:15:50,355
In our times,
if the wife's body was warm,

943
01:15:50,355 --> 01:15:53,230
it caused blisters on
the husband's body.

944
01:15:53,230 --> 01:15:55,855
I just can't fathom
the behaviour of you two!

945
01:16:11,438 --> 01:16:13,063
Khirod!

946
01:16:14,605 --> 01:16:18,534
Oh Khirod!

947
01:16:29,938 --> 01:16:31,563
Khirod!

948
01:16:32,022 --> 01:16:33,563
What are you doing here?

949
01:16:34,022 --> 01:16:35,647
Why have you come here?

950
01:16:35,647 --> 01:16:38,105
In search of you Khirod!

951
01:16:38,105 --> 01:16:40,813
I've also come in search of someone.

952
01:16:40,813 --> 01:16:42,897
You...?

953
01:16:43,313 --> 01:16:44,272
Whom...?

954
01:16:44,272 --> 01:16:47,063
Don't you remember,
there was a boy...

955
01:16:47,063 --> 01:16:50,563
who played khol with
the performers in our house …

956
01:16:50,563 --> 01:16:55,063
and when I played who
looked at me surreptitiously …

957
01:16:55,063 --> 01:16:58,022
who spent nights preparing sweet …

958
01:16:58,022 --> 01:17:00,438
the one who had given me his word...

959
01:17:00,438 --> 01:17:06,355
that he would make a soft,
round sweet like the moon …

960
01:17:06,355 --> 01:17:09,438
who never accepted defeat …

961
01:17:09,438 --> 01:17:12,355
I'm trying to find that boy …

962
01:17:12,355 --> 01:17:14,147
that boy!

963
01:17:15,355 --> 01:17:19,355
That boy can't be found
any more Khirod!

964
01:17:24,397 --> 01:17:29,688
If he can't be found,
I also cannot be found any more!

965
01:17:34,105 --> 01:17:36,813
I'm defeated Khirod! …

966
01:17:41,230 --> 01:17:43,772
I'm defeated!

967
01:18:14,355 --> 01:18:17,105
For whom were you making
the sweet?

968
01:18:17,105 --> 01:18:20,647
It's for me … for you …

969
01:18:20,647 --> 01:18:25,063
Then why do you care about others?

970
01:18:35,397 --> 01:18:39,938
You also will find the way...
Whatever a thousand people may say.

971
01:18:39,938 --> 01:18:45,813
Your hands will light the lamp...
Of my cosy little home.

972
01:18:45,813 --> 01:18:50,813
Let people think whatever they want to...
Let thousand rumors blow in the wind.

973
01:18:50,813 --> 01:18:55,730
You will always find at your side...
Your Khirod and the syrupy ball!

974
01:18:59,647 --> 01:19:02,355
I'll not be defeated Khirod..

975
01:19:03,938 --> 01:19:06,772
Neither will I see you getting defeated!

976
01:19:07,980 --> 01:19:09,230
I know.

977
01:19:31,730 --> 01:19:35,022
Hi Nobin!
What are doing now?

978
01:19:35,022 --> 01:19:36,313
Doing nothing, but will do.

979
01:19:38,522 --> 01:19:41,772
You only say – will do,
will happen …

980
01:19:41,772 --> 01:19:44,938
Just opposite your shop,
I'm opening my sweetmeat shop.

981
01:20:02,147 --> 01:20:04,480
Hey Kanha!

982
01:20:04,480 --> 01:20:06,605
Showing haughtiness, eh?

983
01:20:06,605 --> 01:20:08,730
Hey Bihari!

984
01:20:09,397 --> 01:20:13,188
Go! Fling him to the ground!

985
01:20:13,188 --> 01:20:15,438
That's ok. Go!

986
01:20:16,480 --> 01:20:19,022
Dada! Bihari can't do it!

987
01:20:20,022 --> 01:20:22,188
Let's see what happens!

988
01:20:24,397 --> 01:20:26,063
Brajababu!

989
01:20:26,980 --> 01:20:28,480
Not babu, call me wrestler …

990
01:20:28,480 --> 01:20:31,313
… Braja wrestler!

991
01:20:32,605 --> 01:20:34,355
So...

992
01:20:35,105 --> 01:20:37,563
You've come to fight with Kanha?

993
01:20:37,563 --> 01:20:40,397
Oh no! No!

994
01:20:40,397 --> 01:20:42,563
I've come for rent.

995
01:20:43,522 --> 01:20:45,730
Do you consider me to be
a hired goon...

996
01:20:45,730 --> 01:20:47,897
or a spoiler?

997
01:20:47,897 --> 01:20:51,563
Goons and spoiler are available
on hire, not wrestlers.

998
01:20:51,563 --> 01:20:54,563
No no! I want to
take your shop on rent.

999
01:20:54,563 --> 01:20:56,522
Shop...

1000
01:20:56,522 --> 01:21:03,480
In Bagbazar, you've a shop opposite
Kalidas Indra's …I've come to take that on rent.

1001
01:21:03,480 --> 01:21:06,522
Your brother's adjascnt house…

1002
01:21:06,522 --> 01:21:07,938
Yes yes!

1003
01:21:07,938 --> 01:21:09,230
We stay there on rent.

1004
01:21:10,063 --> 01:21:12,188
Hey fling him!
Fling him to the ground!

1005
01:21:14,980 --> 01:21:17,063
What will you sell from that shop?

1006
01:21:18,355 --> 01:21:19,313
Sweet!

1007
01:21:21,397 --> 01:21:26,105
Your sweet shop
opposite Kalidas Indra's shop?

1008
01:21:33,188 --> 01:21:35,938
Better do one thing!

1009
01:21:35,938 --> 01:21:38,313
Go! Fight one round with Kanha!

1010
01:21:39,605 --> 01:21:40,688
Go!

1011
01:21:43,438 --> 01:21:49,230
My wrestling is as bad as
Kanha's making sweets...

1012
01:21:49,230 --> 01:21:53,313
I cannot wrestle,
can only make sweet.

1013
01:21:53,313 --> 01:21:56,397
Well! Very well said!

1014
01:21:58,522 --> 01:22:00,813
Did you hear what he said?
Yes, sir!

1015
01:22:00,813 --> 01:22:03,063
Listen my dear!

1016
01:22:03,063 --> 01:22:07,063
As a mark of obeisance and two
months' advance rent, give seven rupees.

1017
01:22:07,063 --> 01:22:09,397
Seven rupees! So much?

1018
01:22:09,397 --> 01:22:13,522
Many are waiting to take that shop
at a higher price than that.

1019
01:22:13,522 --> 01:22:16,313
If you can, give … otherwise go!
No, no I will!

1020
01:22:16,313 --> 01:22:19,438
But for that,
I need at least ten days!

1021
01:22:21,480 --> 01:22:23,813
Braja wrestler!

1022
01:22:23,813 --> 01:22:27,147
I'm badly in need of that shop.

1023
01:22:27,147 --> 01:22:30,897
Please do not give it
to anyone before ten days!

1024
01:22:30,897 --> 01:22:34,397
If you need it so badly,
then seven days!

1025
01:22:34,397 --> 01:22:37,147
If you can bring the money within
seven days, the shop is yours.

1026
01:22:37,147 --> 01:22:38,397
If not, forget it!

1027
01:22:44,938 --> 01:22:47,397
Want money? …

1028
01:22:48,397 --> 01:22:50,147
But my dear...

1029
01:22:50,563 --> 01:22:53,147
I don't give money to children!

1030
01:22:58,230 --> 01:22:59,813
Good bye, my boy!

1031
01:23:02,272 --> 01:23:05,897
See! Shop is good!

1032
01:23:05,897 --> 01:23:07,730
Money? I'll give.

1033
01:23:07,730 --> 01:23:10,272
Have to keep something in mortgage.

1034
01:23:10,272 --> 01:23:12,188
What did you say?
Mortgage?

1035
01:23:12,188 --> 01:23:15,230
Yes! Property deed … ornaments …

1036
01:23:15,230 --> 01:23:17,480
have to give something, isn't it?

1037
01:23:17,480 --> 01:23:20,522
Not much! Only ten rupees!

1038
01:23:21,855 --> 01:23:22,730
Ten rupees!

1039
01:23:22,730 --> 01:23:24,147
Oh yes.

1040
01:23:25,730 --> 01:23:28,522
If no one gives me a chance,
what do I do?

1041
01:23:29,938 --> 01:23:33,438
Do I get money from the tree?

1042
01:23:33,438 --> 01:23:35,980
Huh! Says – he will not
give money to kids!

1043
01:23:35,980 --> 01:23:37,147
Am I kid?

1044
01:23:37,147 --> 01:23:40,397
Let the old people sit in their shops!
Nothing new will be made!

1045
01:23:40,397 --> 01:23:43,730
Khirod, someone has to
help, isn't it?

1046
01:23:43,730 --> 01:23:47,063
Doesn't everyone have a 'first day'?

1047
01:23:47,063 --> 01:23:50,272
How do I … the shop …

1048
01:23:55,438 --> 01:23:57,855
What? What's this?

1049
01:23:57,855 --> 01:24:00,897
Your shop...

1050
01:24:00,897 --> 01:24:03,105
Ornaments?
Yes.

1051
01:24:03,105 --> 01:24:05,772
Have you gone mad Khirod?

1052
01:24:05,772 --> 01:24:09,147
Ultimately your ornaments?
Fie on me!

1053
01:24:14,688 --> 01:24:16,855
Who said these are my ornaments?

1054
01:24:16,855 --> 01:24:18,772
These are all gold and silver garbage!

1055
01:24:18,772 --> 01:24:21,147
But you!

1056
01:24:21,147 --> 01:24:24,355
Have you ever seen me
wearing all these?

1057
01:24:25,855 --> 01:24:28,063
Here is my ornament!

1058
01:24:28,063 --> 01:24:29,605
But …

1059
01:24:29,605 --> 01:24:32,855
No ifs and buts …
You establish your shop.

1060
01:24:35,522 --> 01:24:37,980
Will you not give my
things back even today?

1061
01:24:37,980 --> 01:24:40,313
Have you returned the entire money?

1062
01:24:40,313 --> 01:24:43,230
Paid your interest?
No! Then go!

1063
01:24:47,688 --> 01:24:50,022
Come my dear! Come!

1064
01:24:52,022 --> 01:24:54,480
Money … money … money …

1065
01:25:00,938 --> 01:25:03,688
Get out! Out from here!

1066
01:25:03,688 --> 01:25:06,272
What do you think of me?
An usurer?

1067
01:25:06,272 --> 01:25:08,272
Or have I started a
money-lending business?

1068
01:25:08,272 --> 01:25:09,813
Brought the ornaments of
your newly wed wife?

1069
01:25:09,813 --> 01:25:10,897
Mam … I …

1070
01:25:10,897 --> 01:25:13,397
I had told you on the first day – Nobin,
I'm there for you.

1071
01:25:13,397 --> 01:25:15,272
Did I tell you to bring the ornaments
of your new wife?

1072
01:25:15,272 --> 01:25:17,105
Pick it up! Pick up! Quick!

1073
01:25:17,105 --> 01:25:19,813
Huh! Stripped the new wife
of all her ornaments!

1074
01:25:19,813 --> 01:25:22,647
Fie on you! Such a sin!

1075
01:25:23,605 --> 01:25:28,647
I had gone to a Parsee usurer.
But from his attitude, I could understand

1076
01:25:28,647 --> 01:25:30,938
I would never be able to get
the ornaments back.

1077
01:25:31,730 --> 01:25:33,730
That's why I came to you.

1078
01:25:34,355 --> 01:25:36,272
Why did you go to such an usurer?

1079
01:25:36,272 --> 01:25:38,730
You should have come to me first.

1080
01:25:38,730 --> 01:25:41,355
Setting up a sweetmeat shop, isn't it?

1081
01:25:43,105 --> 01:25:46,063
Will this gold coin do?

1082
01:25:48,230 --> 01:25:49,855
I don't need this much of money.

1083
01:25:49,855 --> 01:25:51,813
Keep it.

1084
01:25:51,813 --> 01:25:54,480
Opening a new shop …
furnish it properly!

1085
01:25:54,480 --> 01:25:57,813
It needs time to get profit!

1086
01:25:57,813 --> 01:26:00,272
Madam!

1087
01:26:01,813 --> 01:26:03,605
But...

1088
01:26:03,605 --> 01:26:06,147
I'll return your money!

1089
01:26:06,147 --> 01:26:08,855
I know Nabin!
I've advanced in age!

1090
01:26:08,855 --> 01:26:10,355
I know people.

1091
01:26:10,355 --> 01:26:14,230
If it does good to you,
you'll do good to many more people.

1092
01:26:17,688 --> 01:26:19,605
Ok! Ok!

1093
01:26:23,980 --> 01:26:26,230
Don't ever bend your
head down to any one!

1094
01:26:33,563 --> 01:26:37,230
See, Bihari could do …
can you do it too?

1095
01:26:38,938 --> 01:26:40,855
It will happen...

1096
01:26:44,272 --> 01:26:46,605
Impossible will be possible...

1097
01:26:46,605 --> 01:26:49,230
What will be will be!

1098
01:26:49,230 --> 01:26:54,605
Shadows of dark cloud
have been removed...

1099
01:26:54,605 --> 01:27:04,855
With your sweet smile
people are following your path!

1100
01:27:04,855 --> 01:27:10,938
You are that crazy wind
that encourages the wings to fly...

1101
01:27:10,938 --> 01:27:16,063
All new thoughts are on soar!

1102
01:27:16,063 --> 01:27:21,397
You are that direction
which leads new dreams!

1103
01:27:21,397 --> 01:27:27,188
Everything is painted new with colors!

1104
01:27:35,563 --> 01:27:41,355
After a year...

1105
01:27:52,688 --> 01:27:55,313
Why is the counter empty?

1106
01:27:55,313 --> 01:27:57,022
Then who will make the sweets?

1107
01:27:57,980 --> 01:28:00,022
From morning till night
the same thing …

1108
01:28:00,022 --> 01:28:01,938
making the same white balls …

1109
01:28:01,938 --> 01:28:03,813
this father-in-law of mine
is not making sweets …

1110
01:28:03,813 --> 01:28:05,772
he's after making the Taj Mahal!

1111
01:28:05,772 --> 01:28:08,522
Since two years it's being made …
and being made …

1112
01:28:08,522 --> 01:28:10,480
Don't talk about a thing which
you don't understand!

1113
01:28:10,480 --> 01:28:14,355
Yes! He understands everything!

1114
01:28:14,355 --> 01:28:16,855
Our own Ram Raja Mohan Roy!

1115
01:28:16,855 --> 01:28:17,897
What did you say?

1116
01:28:17,897 --> 01:28:20,647
"Ram Raja Mohan Roy"?

1117
01:28:20,647 --> 01:28:22,438
Raja Rammohan Roy.

1118
01:28:22,438 --> 01:28:24,855
How many more days
shall pass like this?

1119
01:28:24,855 --> 01:28:27,563
Make your new mishti,
But you'll also have to make the other sweets.

1120
01:28:27,563 --> 01:28:30,563
Otherwise where will
the money come from?

1121
01:28:31,313 --> 01:28:32,855
See!

1122
01:28:32,855 --> 01:28:35,105
This is the problem of women!

1123
01:28:35,105 --> 01:28:38,438
Now you say – make mishti and
then you say – make money!

1124
01:28:38,438 --> 01:28:39,855
You yourself don't know what you want.

1125
01:28:39,855 --> 01:28:41,522
Don't talk about that sweet!

1126
01:28:41,522 --> 01:28:44,813
It's almost two years now and
we're yet to see it!

1127
01:28:44,813 --> 01:28:46,980
You are ruinning both
your home and work!

1128
01:28:46,980 --> 01:28:49,230
Your ability is well known to me!

1129
01:28:49,230 --> 01:28:52,063
Then I … I …
what am I doing now?

1130
01:28:52,063 --> 01:28:53,813
Who am I doing it for?

1131
01:28:53,813 --> 01:28:56,147
What are you looking at?

1132
01:29:07,563 --> 01:29:08,938
Call my son.

1133
01:29:08,938 --> 01:29:11,022
It's already late.
Won't you have lunch today?

1134
01:29:11,022 --> 01:29:13,563
If it continues like this ma,
we'll have to starve.

1135
01:29:13,563 --> 01:29:16,313
Why? What again?

1136
01:29:16,313 --> 01:29:20,938
Ma, I've decided to sit on the other side
of the door to manage the shop.

1137
01:29:20,938 --> 01:29:24,522
I'll talk with the milkman and
other suppliers.

1138
01:29:24,522 --> 01:29:27,022
A housewife will look after a shop?

1139
01:29:28,230 --> 01:29:30,605
Otherwise the shop will
go to the dogs!

1140
01:29:30,605 --> 01:29:32,647
The amount of loan that
we've incurred by now …

1141
01:29:32,647 --> 01:29:36,563
If we fail to steer it properly
we will lose everything.

1142
01:29:36,563 --> 01:29:40,313
Look my dear! I've allowed many
untoward behaviour of Nobin,

1143
01:29:40,313 --> 01:29:42,147
but I'll not tolerate this!

1144
01:29:42,147 --> 01:29:43,063
What'll people think?

1145
01:29:43,063 --> 01:29:47,355
If you think about people's
thoughts, what'll people think?

1146
01:29:47,355 --> 01:29:51,147
People will criticize even
you do something or not!

1147
01:29:52,355 --> 01:29:54,272
That, of course, is right.

1148
01:29:55,397 --> 01:29:59,105
Nobin's dad, you know,
was also like this.

1149
01:29:59,105 --> 01:30:02,272
I couldn't bend him...

1150
01:30:03,272 --> 01:30:05,272
Try if you can.

1151
01:30:06,230 --> 01:30:07,480
Take it!

1152
01:30:09,272 --> 01:30:11,397
Come on! Take it!

1153
01:30:14,397 --> 01:30:16,772
That's all right!

1154
01:30:19,313 --> 01:30:21,147
Sometimes I charge an anna per seer …

1155
01:30:21,147 --> 01:30:22,563
Sometimes two annas …

1156
01:30:22,563 --> 01:30:24,522
And from some I charge even four annas.

1157
01:30:24,522 --> 01:30:27,897
It's my milk, I'll decide what
price will I charge to whom.

1158
01:30:27,897 --> 01:30:30,772
If you want, take it.
Otherwise you milk the cows!

1159
01:30:30,772 --> 01:30:33,522
You cannot increase the price
every now and then!

1160
01:30:33,522 --> 01:30:36,480
With the cost of milk,
the price of sweets are also got to be higher.

1161
01:30:36,480 --> 01:30:41,938
The condition of your shop suggests,
you cannot sale this way or that way.

1162
01:30:41,938 --> 01:30:46,772
And listen!
I don't talk business with women!

1163
01:30:46,772 --> 01:30:49,938
Tomorrow, will you
take milk at this price?

1164
01:30:49,938 --> 01:30:51,147
Ok. Send it.

1165
01:30:51,147 --> 01:30:52,938
All right.

1166
01:31:00,563 --> 01:31:03,813
See, there's no one in the shop.

1167
01:31:03,813 --> 01:31:04,730
Let's go!

1168
01:31:04,730 --> 01:31:07,397
Please wait sir! Please!

1169
01:31:08,397 --> 01:31:10,397
What do you like to have?

1170
01:31:10,397 --> 01:31:12,230
What do I see, Natabar?

1171
01:31:12,230 --> 01:31:15,772
Maheshdada, customer has come.

1172
01:31:15,772 --> 01:31:19,272
I want the mishti of Lady Canning
and some babu sandesh.

1173
01:31:19,272 --> 01:31:21,438
Is it there?

1174
01:31:22,480 --> 01:31:26,480
We don't have that, but we've
very good sandesh and chhanaporha.

1175
01:31:26,480 --> 01:31:28,938
'Dedo'? 'Porha' (burnt)?

1176
01:31:28,938 --> 01:31:32,022
In such shops you'll get only
stuff like dedo, porha

1177
01:31:32,022 --> 01:31:33,772
… nothing else.

1178
01:31:33,772 --> 01:31:36,438
Don't you realize why there's
no customer in the shop?

1179
01:31:36,438 --> 01:31:38,605
Come, let's go to that shop.
Let's go.

1180
01:31:46,313 --> 01:31:47,855
What?

1181
01:31:51,438 --> 01:31:53,605
To hell with you!

1182
01:31:56,522 --> 01:31:58,272
Hey! Nobin!

1183
01:32:09,980 --> 01:32:14,355
Master, may I tell you something?

1184
01:32:14,355 --> 01:32:15,938
Tell me.

1185
01:32:15,938 --> 01:32:18,647
Don't take Nobin so seriously.

1186
01:32:18,647 --> 01:32:22,897
The condition of his shop suggests,
it'll go to the dogs any day.

1187
01:32:22,897 --> 01:32:28,105
It is wise to extract the poison fang
of a snake, while it's still a baby.

1188
01:32:28,105 --> 01:32:33,897
Poison grows without telling
the snake or the charmer!

1189
01:32:35,230 --> 01:32:41,022
One who can make a new mishti
in an hour's time, is an ordinary boy?

1190
01:32:41,022 --> 01:32:43,813
Only if I could taste that
mango desert he made …

1191
01:32:43,813 --> 01:32:46,313
He has made nothing new…

1192
01:32:46,313 --> 01:32:49,938
Since the last two years,
he's been making only balls …

1193
01:32:51,647 --> 01:32:53,730
One who doesn't think about time...

1194
01:32:54,938 --> 01:32:57,022
will have to be taken seriously!

1195
01:33:10,480 --> 01:33:11,938
Where to?

1196
01:33:12,772 --> 01:33:16,647
At Paolo sahib's house in Bandel.

1197
01:33:16,647 --> 01:33:19,563
Has arranged a musical party in the
morning, he has invited us there.

1198
01:33:21,772 --> 01:33:22,897
Will you take me with you?

1199
01:33:25,855 --> 01:33:27,522
Boatman, please row
the boat to the shore!

1200
01:33:50,313 --> 01:34:06,105
As dark as the black bumblebee
my friend, when will you come...

1201
01:34:06,105 --> 01:34:13,355
tell me, oh tell me!

1202
01:34:58,397 --> 01:35:03,063
If you want to go, my friend...

1203
01:35:03,063 --> 01:35:10,188
Leave back the towel on your shoulder.

1204
01:35:25,355 --> 01:35:36,605
As dark as the black bumblebee
my friend, when will you come...

1205
01:35:36,605 --> 01:35:43,813
tell me, oh tell me!

1206
01:36:05,147 --> 01:36:14,605
The cool shade of the banyan tree...

1207
01:36:14,605 --> 01:36:21,647
Just like that is the affection of my friend.

1208
01:36:41,688 --> 01:36:52,647
As dark as the black bumblebee
my friend, when will you come...

1209
01:36:52,647 --> 01:36:57,647
tell me, oh tell me!

1210
01:37:33,772 --> 01:37:35,480
Wonderful!

1211
01:37:40,313 --> 01:37:43,063
Where is your house?
What's your name?

1212
01:37:43,063 --> 01:37:45,480
I live in Bagbazar.

1213
01:37:45,480 --> 01:37:47,480
My name is Nobin Chandra Das.

1214
01:37:47,480 --> 01:37:49,605
Basically, I'm sweet maker by
profession… singer by passion.

1215
01:37:49,605 --> 01:37:52,022
That means there's a common
thing between us …

1216
01:37:52,022 --> 01:37:53,272
'Kaman'(Cannon)?

1217
01:37:53,272 --> 01:37:55,855
Hey! Why 'kaman'?

1218
01:37:55,855 --> 01:37:57,688
What did I do sahib?

1219
01:37:57,688 --> 01:38:01,772
Common means you love
cooking, I love cooking …

1220
01:38:01,772 --> 01:38:04,188
you love music … I love music …

1221
01:38:04,188 --> 01:38:06,355
that's what we call 'common'!

1222
01:38:06,355 --> 01:38:10,105
Don't get scared!
He's praising you!

1223
01:38:11,397 --> 01:38:13,272
William! Bring some cake!

1224
01:38:14,772 --> 01:38:16,730
Cake made of 'hing' (asafetida)?

1225
01:38:19,563 --> 01:38:21,355
Is he William?

1226
01:38:21,355 --> 01:38:23,563
Horro … William Horro.

1227
01:38:28,355 --> 01:38:30,105
Have you tasted it before?

1228
01:38:30,105 --> 01:38:32,855
No! Seen it in
sahib para (European locality).

1229
01:38:33,980 --> 01:38:36,897
Tell me what's there!
Wow! I can't miss it.

1230
01:38:36,897 --> 01:38:38,980
This is posset!
Correct posset…

1231
01:38:38,980 --> 01:38:42,063
We call it cottage cheese.

1232
01:38:46,022 --> 01:38:47,522
But...

1233
01:38:47,522 --> 01:38:50,730
how come the posset is so smooth?
Your posset is a bit rough …

1234
01:38:50,730 --> 01:38:53,980
Ours is smooth... smooth!

1235
01:38:53,980 --> 01:38:56,480
Your posset is rough …
Sahib's posset is smooth.

1236
01:38:59,147 --> 01:39:01,272
I've a request Sahib!

1237
01:39:01,272 --> 01:39:02,772
Tell me.

1238
01:39:02,772 --> 01:39:07,438
Will you please take me to your kitchen …

1239
01:39:07,438 --> 01:39:11,647
I mean where you prepare your posset …
where you knead it …will you show me?

1240
01:39:11,647 --> 01:39:12,563
Sure.

1241
01:39:12,563 --> 01:39:13,313
Will you?

1242
01:39:13,313 --> 01:39:14,605
Sure. I will.

1243
01:39:16,022 --> 01:39:17,855
But …

1244
01:39:17,855 --> 01:39:20,397
you'll sing one more song …

1245
01:39:29,313 --> 01:39:30,522
Wow!

1246
01:39:31,355 --> 01:39:32,188
Look!

1247
01:39:32,188 --> 01:39:33,688
This is where you make
your sweetmeat?

1248
01:39:35,688 --> 01:39:37,605
Oh! It's lemon!

1249
01:39:37,980 --> 01:39:39,938
We also …

1250
01:39:39,938 --> 01:39:42,105
Be patient!

1251
01:39:53,230 --> 01:39:56,313
So it's water of chhana!

1252
01:40:00,605 --> 01:40:04,355
If whey is mixed with milk,

1253
01:40:04,355 --> 01:40:08,063
then only the posset will be smooth.
Oh! Then that's the key?

1254
01:40:08,063 --> 01:40:10,105
Sahib!

1255
01:40:10,938 --> 01:40:15,272
This whey will make
my syrupy ball.

1256
01:40:16,355 --> 01:40:18,938
'Rosogolla'? No, it's
the syrupy ball...

1257
01:40:19,938 --> 01:40:21,522
'Rosogolla' – what's that?

1258
01:40:21,522 --> 01:40:24,022
Sahib…

1259
01:40:29,063 --> 01:40:31,730
that's my life Sahib…

1260
01:40:33,647 --> 01:40:35,563
...that's my love!

1261
01:40:35,563 --> 01:40:38,397
Love?

1262
01:40:38,397 --> 01:40:40,647
Remember, my young friend,

1263
01:40:40,647 --> 01:40:43,438
love is all about keeping promises.

1264
01:40:51,022 --> 01:40:52,980
Rosogolla…

1265
01:40:54,313 --> 01:40:55,522
Will happen!

1266
01:41:02,480 --> 01:41:04,147
Son?

1267
01:41:07,063 --> 01:41:08,897
Where had you been son?

1268
01:41:08,897 --> 01:41:11,272
Tell me, why do you
do like this?

1269
01:41:11,272 --> 01:41:12,563
Don't you feel our concern?

1270
01:41:12,563 --> 01:41:14,980
Giving you my word,
I'll not do this any more...

1271
01:41:14,980 --> 01:41:16,188
Come! Come!

1272
01:41:19,230 --> 01:41:20,980
Go!

1273
01:41:22,397 --> 01:41:24,063
Khirod!

1274
01:41:24,063 --> 01:41:27,063
Our new mishti will be made!

1275
01:41:27,063 --> 01:41:30,980
You know, I'm coming from
so far a place called Bandel!

1276
01:41:30,980 --> 01:41:34,855
There that Paolo sahib
was calling our syrupy ball...

1277
01:41:34,855 --> 01:41:37,230
'Rosogolla' … 'Rosogolla' …

1278
01:41:37,230 --> 01:41:39,105
Nice name … isn't it?

1279
01:41:39,105 --> 01:41:41,397
Hey… where are you going?
Where?

1280
01:41:42,730 --> 01:41:45,147
You will do whatever you like on
the plea of making that new mishti...

1281
01:41:45,147 --> 01:41:47,105
and we'll have to accept that?

1282
01:41:47,105 --> 01:41:48,938
No more plea …
this time it'll happen.

1283
01:41:48,938 --> 01:41:50,480
Rosogolla!

1284
01:41:50,480 --> 01:41:52,897
Sweet, sweet, sweet … is your head
filled only with sweet?

1285
01:41:52,897 --> 01:41:54,522
Yes...!

1286
01:42:03,855 --> 01:42:06,647
And you are in my mind!

1287
01:42:06,647 --> 01:42:09,188
I know you'll make me cry again.

1288
01:42:09,188 --> 01:42:11,397
I'll not make you cry any more.

1289
01:42:11,397 --> 01:42:13,938
I give you my word. By god …

1290
01:42:14,938 --> 01:42:17,563
This time our Rosogolla
will be made definitely!

1291
01:42:56,938 --> 01:42:58,938
Maheshdada!

1292
01:43:07,022 --> 01:43:12,438
Ho! Done! It's done!

1293
01:43:34,522 --> 01:43:37,647
Where are we going, my dear?

1294
01:43:38,397 --> 01:43:39,855
You've forgotten?

1295
01:43:53,813 --> 01:43:54,730
Take it!

1296
01:43:57,063 --> 01:43:58,938
Your sweet... as white as moon!

1297
01:43:58,938 --> 01:44:02,563
I feed you everyday …

1298
01:44:03,563 --> 01:44:05,688
Today you feed me!

1299
01:44:06,563 --> 01:44:07,397
Me!

1300
01:46:43,188 --> 01:46:46,897
Do you know…
here a bridge will be made…

1301
01:46:46,897 --> 01:46:50,147
Howrah station is on the other side …
People will reach there much faster.

1302
01:46:50,147 --> 01:46:54,188
That's good,
but nothing is being done …

1303
01:46:54,188 --> 01:46:57,272
only beating the drum beforehand!

1304
01:46:57,272 --> 01:46:59,147
Beating the drum is also necessary!

1305
01:46:59,147 --> 01:47:04,272
Making a good thing is not enough... you'll
also have to let people know about it!

1306
01:47:04,272 --> 01:47:08,272
We'll have to let people know
about your new sweet!

1307
01:47:08,272 --> 01:47:10,980
From now on
whoever comes to your shop...

1308
01:47:10,980 --> 01:47:14,605
give him your Rosogolla
to taste … for free!

1309
01:47:14,605 --> 01:47:16,897
They will bring you new customers!

1310
01:47:16,897 --> 01:47:18,397
You know me very well.

1311
01:47:18,397 --> 01:47:21,397
I love to feed people.

1312
01:47:21,397 --> 01:47:27,355
But I don't like matters relating
to money!

1313
01:47:29,897 --> 01:47:33,272
When will you grow up my dear?
Leave it!

1314
01:47:33,272 --> 01:47:35,688
What's the use in growing up!

1315
01:47:35,688 --> 01:47:38,313
You're there … isn't it?

1316
01:47:38,313 --> 01:47:42,230
Shameless!
Everyone is watching!

1317
01:47:47,605 --> 01:47:50,272
Hallo, Hemen bhaia!
Is Kalibabu there?

1318
01:47:50,272 --> 01:47:51,147
Yes!

1319
01:47:52,313 --> 01:47:53,855
Hemen!

1320
01:47:53,855 --> 01:47:56,938
Go inside! The idiot
can't trace a single thing!

1321
01:47:56,938 --> 01:47:59,563
A rascal has come to work
in my shop …

1322
01:48:01,563 --> 01:48:03,522
Ram Ram Kalibabu!

1323
01:48:03,522 --> 01:48:07,980
This is Nobin's Rosogolla... the
new sweet … it's very good!

1324
01:48:15,230 --> 01:48:18,605
Seems the sales from your shop
is not very encouraging?

1325
01:48:18,605 --> 01:48:21,772
You have to push things to people!

1326
01:48:21,772 --> 01:48:24,897
No no! Our products are moving …

1327
01:48:24,897 --> 01:48:28,980
Daughter in law said – Go!
Let everyone taste our new sweet!

1328
01:48:28,980 --> 01:48:33,897
What's there in this Rosogolla?
It's just another sweet!

1329
01:48:37,730 --> 01:48:40,105
It has...

1330
01:48:40,105 --> 01:48:41,647
the essence of love...

1331
01:48:43,230 --> 01:48:45,938
the labour of sleepless night...

1332
01:48:46,813 --> 01:48:49,855
the peace of soul…

1333
01:48:49,855 --> 01:48:52,188
And the most important of all…

1334
01:48:53,230 --> 01:48:55,522
It has the answer to all the fight!

1335
01:48:57,105 --> 01:48:58,355
Go away!

1336
01:49:10,355 --> 01:49:12,480
Even flies are not coming!

1337
01:49:12,480 --> 01:49:16,313
Papa! Feeling very thirsty papa!

1338
01:49:17,980 --> 01:49:20,813
All the time you feel
something or the other…

1339
01:49:20,813 --> 01:49:24,688
Sometimes you feel hungry…
sometimes thirsty …

1340
01:49:24,688 --> 01:49:27,063
Ok wait! Let me see!

1341
01:49:29,397 --> 01:49:32,438
I had two inside … ten in all.

1342
01:49:32,438 --> 01:49:34,438
Give me! Fast!

1343
01:49:34,897 --> 01:49:36,272
Coachman!
Yes Bagelaji!

1344
01:49:36,272 --> 01:49:40,272
If you find a place for drinking
water, stop there!

1345
01:49:40,272 --> 01:49:43,647
There are sweetmeat shops on both sides...
the one on the right is crowded and the left

1346
01:49:43,647 --> 01:49:46,188
shop is empty.

1347
01:49:46,772 --> 01:49:48,522
Come son! Get down!

1348
01:49:52,438 --> 01:49:54,647
Come son come!

1349
01:49:58,605 --> 01:49:59,938
Excuse me!

1350
01:49:59,938 --> 01:50:01,938
Can we have drinking water?

1351
01:50:01,938 --> 01:50:03,938
Yes!

1352
01:50:07,980 --> 01:50:09,730
No no! No need for sweets!

1353
01:50:09,730 --> 01:50:12,105
Just drinking water will do!
Have your seat please!

1354
01:50:13,313 --> 01:50:15,563
Come, my son! Please sit!

1355
01:50:15,563 --> 01:50:17,897
We're Bengali.

1356
01:50:17,897 --> 01:50:20,563
We don't drink water in empty stomach!

1357
01:50:20,563 --> 01:50:24,355
Have some sweets … then water.
Have your sit please!

1358
01:50:24,355 --> 01:50:26,063
Come son! Eat!

1359
01:50:26,063 --> 01:50:28,105
Hold it!

1360
01:50:29,938 --> 01:50:32,980
Papa! The sweet is excellent!

1361
01:50:32,980 --> 01:50:34,563
Excellent!

1362
01:50:37,230 --> 01:50:38,355
Is it good babu?

1363
01:50:38,355 --> 01:50:40,188
Wow! What's the name of this sweet?

1364
01:50:40,188 --> 01:50:41,230
Rosogolla.

1365
01:50:41,230 --> 01:50:43,230
Do one thing.
Give me all of them.

1366
01:50:43,230 --> 01:50:45,022
You'll take all the Rosogollas?

1367
01:50:45,022 --> 01:50:48,730
Oh yes! Pack it!

1368
01:50:48,730 --> 01:50:51,230
Maheshdada!

1369
01:50:51,230 --> 01:50:52,897
This is an excellent sweet.

1370
01:51:23,772 --> 01:51:26,230
Nobin's shop?

1371
01:51:34,563 --> 01:51:36,855
Count the number of customers!

1372
01:51:36,855 --> 01:51:38,397
Sir?

1373
01:51:48,938 --> 01:51:50,313
Take it!

1374
01:51:50,313 --> 01:51:51,355
What will you give me?

1375
01:51:51,355 --> 01:51:55,022
You?
Here's your gift – Rosogolla!

1376
01:51:55,022 --> 01:51:56,688
Rosogolla?

1377
01:51:56,688 --> 01:51:59,522
Go! Give it quickly and come back!

1378
01:52:01,147 --> 01:52:04,563
Didi! Dada gave this!

1379
01:52:16,563 --> 01:52:18,897
Hi Sudhirbabu! What are these?

1380
01:52:18,897 --> 01:52:20,480
My new son-in-law has come!

1381
01:52:20,480 --> 01:52:23,480
Taking three sher rohu
and Nobin's Rosogolla …

1382
01:52:23,480 --> 01:52:25,522
after all it's a question of prestige!

1383
01:52:25,522 --> 01:52:27,355
Of course!

1384
01:52:28,730 --> 01:52:31,855
It's my milk and that's my price...

1385
01:52:31,855 --> 01:52:34,397
take it or leave it!

1386
01:52:48,355 --> 01:52:51,022
Have you missed your way?

1387
01:52:51,748 --> 01:52:56,647
I thought it was
the Mediterranean's distance...

1388
01:52:56,647 --> 01:53:01,730
Vidyasagar too had to cross the river
Damodar when needed.

1389
01:53:01,730 --> 01:53:03,438
What's the need?

1390
01:53:03,438 --> 01:53:10,272
The anarchy that has been set regarding
the price of milk has to be resolved – isn't it?

1391
01:53:12,563 --> 01:53:13,563
Anarchy?

1392
01:53:13,563 --> 01:53:15,397
Don't you think it's anarchy?

1393
01:53:15,397 --> 01:53:18,647
Previously, only Kashi milkman
used to charge more.

1394
01:53:18,647 --> 01:53:22,938
After my improvemen in bussiness
all the milkmen are charging higher.

1395
01:53:22,938 --> 01:53:25,563
Your sales, your money
… you resolve it!

1396
01:53:27,855 --> 01:53:30,730
You invent so many new things…

1397
01:53:31,938 --> 01:53:33,688
do something about it!

1398
01:53:33,688 --> 01:53:38,980
I will not only invent the sweet...
but also discover the path!

1399
01:53:41,522 --> 01:53:44,980
Will the milkmen accept it?

1400
01:53:44,980 --> 01:53:47,063
Nothing will happen with
my lone efforts!

1401
01:53:47,063 --> 01:53:51,397
If you cannot get united,
their anarchy will increase day by day!

1402
01:53:51,397 --> 01:53:55,272
For instance, Kali… he didn't
agree … will the others agree?

1403
01:53:55,272 --> 01:53:58,897
They're actually scared of Kali uncle,
but they respect you!

1404
01:53:58,897 --> 01:54:02,480
If you be on our side,
I'll convince others!

1405
01:54:02,480 --> 01:54:09,313
Moira's son! Your behaviour, your
language … all have become sweet!

1406
01:54:09,313 --> 01:54:12,105
You've cornered all of us!

1407
01:54:12,105 --> 01:54:15,772
That's why we've been compelled to
organize this meeting here!

1408
01:54:15,772 --> 01:54:18,147
Milkman brothers!
I'm giving you this warning!

1409
01:54:18,147 --> 01:54:22,522
If you do not keep the same price
throughout Kolkata,

1410
01:54:22,522 --> 01:54:26,480
not one moira will
purchase a single drop of milk from you!

1411
01:54:26,480 --> 01:54:28,063
Rightly said!

1412
01:54:28,063 --> 01:54:33,772
That's why the price of milk that will be settled
here tonight in this milk depot of Bowbazar.

1413
01:54:33,772 --> 01:54:38,563
…That will be the fixed price of milk from
tomorrow throughout Kolkata.

1414
01:54:40,063 --> 01:54:42,605
You've started an unethical
business with milk.

1415
01:54:42,605 --> 01:54:44,563
Don't you feel ashamed of yourselves?

1416
01:54:44,563 --> 01:54:46,563
Since we moiras have assembled here,

1417
01:54:46,563 --> 01:54:50,522
Don't think that milk is
required only for making sweets.

1418
01:54:50,522 --> 01:54:54,647
Children and the ailing people
also need it badly!

1419
01:54:55,938 --> 01:55:00,897
No! Business doesn't mean
duping people.

1420
01:55:02,605 --> 01:55:05,813
Being honest also you can live happily.

1421
01:55:05,813 --> 01:55:09,897
Milkman brothers agreeing to our
proposal, raise your hands!

1422
01:55:11,605 --> 01:55:13,938
I say – raise your hands!

1423
01:55:13,938 --> 01:55:16,980
What happened... raise your hands!

1424
01:55:18,980 --> 01:55:20,563
What's your name?

1425
01:55:20,563 --> 01:55:21,438
Ganguram.

1426
01:55:21,438 --> 01:55:25,355
Slowly the wind rises!

1427
01:55:27,397 --> 01:55:31,522
The wind rises slowly!

1428
01:55:32,522 --> 01:55:36,230
News floats in the air!

1429
01:55:37,938 --> 01:55:42,897
Folk tales are born in every household!

1430
01:55:42,897 --> 01:55:49,188
See slowly the wind is rising!
See the wind rising slowly!

1431
01:55:49,188 --> 01:55:51,938
The wayward wind will turn...

1432
01:55:51,938 --> 01:55:54,563
Into a Norwester cyclone!

1433
01:55:54,563 --> 01:55:57,480
Oh young! Oh unripe!

1434
01:55:57,480 --> 01:56:00,105
Save the half dead!

1435
01:56:00,105 --> 01:56:02,855
Oh young! Oh unripe!

1436
01:56:02,855 --> 01:56:05,563
Break the cage!

1437
01:56:27,397 --> 01:56:32,813
Carrying the baggage on
your shoulder Is not easy!

1438
01:56:32,813 --> 01:56:38,230
You're the boatman that will
take people across the river!

1439
01:57:27,355 --> 01:57:30,647
I'm Rupchand Pakshi … I'll
have your rosogolla …

1440
01:57:30,647 --> 01:57:34,438
I'll turn you into a bird
… Train you how to fly!

1441
01:57:34,438 --> 01:57:36,147
He doesn't want to fly!

1442
01:57:36,730 --> 01:57:39,397
Rupchand Pakshi's songs
are the pride of Bagbazar!

1443
01:57:39,397 --> 01:57:42,397
Not me, you're our pride!

1444
01:57:49,397 --> 01:57:52,105
The absolutely impossible will happen!

1445
01:57:52,105 --> 01:57:55,188
Whatever has to happen will happen!

1446
01:57:55,188 --> 01:58:00,105
The shadow of the dark
cloud has passed!

1447
01:58:00,105 --> 01:58:05,522
You self unconscious!
Listen with your sweet smile...

1448
01:58:05,522 --> 01:58:10,647
Everyone has started following you!

1449
01:58:10,647 --> 01:58:15,605
You're like that mad wind that
instigates the wings to fly

1450
01:58:15,605 --> 01:58:21,397
All new thoughts have started flying!

1451
01:58:21,397 --> 01:58:26,980
You're the target to that end
that makes the dream story...

1452
01:58:26,980 --> 01:58:32,522
Everything has got tinged
in the new colour!

1453
01:59:01,397 --> 01:59:02,730
Come!

1454
01:59:05,063 --> 01:59:07,522
Keep watch on the backside!
Yes! I'm going!

1455
01:59:08,272 --> 01:59:12,855
O Ghanashyam!
Appear before me!

1456
01:59:13,813 --> 01:59:16,063
Thief! Thief!

1457
01:59:16,063 --> 01:59:18,147
Hey Bipin! Come!
Catch the thief!

1458
01:59:19,688 --> 01:59:21,897
Hold!
We're sweet makers not thieves!

1459
01:59:21,897 --> 01:59:23,605
Stop! Stop!

1460
01:59:23,605 --> 01:59:24,980
Are you sweet makers?
Yes...

1461
01:59:24,980 --> 01:59:28,022
Heard a lot about your Rosogolla!

1462
01:59:28,022 --> 01:59:31,688
So we thought if we could learn
the tricks surreptitiously!

1463
01:59:31,688 --> 01:59:35,855
Go! What are you waiting for?

1464
01:59:35,855 --> 01:59:38,313
Get up please! Get up!
These people were trying to …

1465
01:59:38,313 --> 01:59:39,897
Oh! Maheshdada!

1466
01:59:39,897 --> 01:59:41,730
Look at their interest to learn!

1467
01:59:41,730 --> 01:59:43,230
I'll teach you!

1468
01:59:43,230 --> 01:59:45,313
You'll teach us?

1469
01:59:45,313 --> 01:59:48,980
With the water from Ganga
worshipping Goddess Ganga!

1470
01:59:48,980 --> 01:59:50,438
That's it!

1471
01:59:50,438 --> 01:59:51,980
I've come from Krishnanagar.

1472
01:59:51,980 --> 01:59:53,647
I'm from Belgachhia.

1473
01:59:53,647 --> 01:59:54,813
I'm from Bardhaman.

1474
01:59:54,813 --> 01:59:56,313
I've come from Baranagar.

1475
01:59:58,688 --> 02:00:00,563
Did you understand Rammohan babu?

1476
02:00:00,563 --> 02:00:02,313
Brajamohan … Brajamohan …

1477
02:00:02,313 --> 02:00:05,688
When will you be practical?

1478
02:00:05,688 --> 02:00:07,147
You're not listening to my words!

1479
02:00:07,147 --> 02:00:10,522
How long will you teach people
to make Rosogolla?

1480
02:00:10,522 --> 02:00:14,647
I have forbidden you to talk
with food in your mouth!

1481
02:00:14,647 --> 02:00:16,897
Hey! Have you emptied your mouthful?

1482
02:00:16,897 --> 02:00:18,563
Ma! But I haven't spoken a word!

1483
02:00:18,563 --> 02:00:21,980
Khirod … but I've reduced
teaching... isn't it?

1484
02:00:21,980 --> 02:00:24,188
I don't understand
why you are so angry on me!

1485
02:00:24,188 --> 02:00:26,022
Oho! It's very unjustified to be angry!

1486
02:00:26,022 --> 02:00:30,855
Will you become Raja Harishchandra
by giving away our hard earned thing?

1487
02:00:30,855 --> 02:00:34,563
May I tell you one thing?
Will you obey me?

1488
02:00:34,563 --> 02:00:37,147
Will I tell it before taking food or after?
Speak up!

1489
02:00:37,147 --> 02:00:39,480
I mean, I'll have to go to
Bardhaman to teach …

1490
02:00:46,105 --> 02:00:48,647
Going to European locality for
teaching them …

1491
02:00:49,480 --> 02:00:52,105
Then Dulalbabu …

1492
02:00:52,105 --> 02:00:53,688
Careful!

1493
02:00:53,688 --> 02:00:54,855
Are you all right?

1494
02:00:55,688 --> 02:00:57,730
Hemen!

1495
02:00:57,730 --> 02:00:58,938
Call Dulal!

1496
02:00:58,938 --> 02:01:01,980
Actually sweet had never been
patented before!

1497
02:01:01,980 --> 02:01:05,105
Had an intention of mesmerizing people by
doing it for the first time.

1498
02:01:05,105 --> 02:01:07,438
Stall your hard work!

1499
02:01:08,188 --> 02:01:10,522
Better try this one!

1500
02:01:12,938 --> 02:01:16,480
Impressed! Impressed!

1501
02:01:16,480 --> 02:01:19,480
Because you underestimated me!

1502
02:01:20,147 --> 02:01:23,188
I'm one of those few native
Indians...

1503
02:01:23,188 --> 02:01:24,938
...who are graduates.

1504
02:01:25,730 --> 02:01:29,397
See! See it for yourself!
New discovery!

1505
02:01:30,647 --> 02:01:34,647
Give! Give him
the rosogolla made by you.

1506
02:01:34,647 --> 02:01:37,147
He makes rosogolla.
His rosogolla?

1507
02:01:37,147 --> 02:01:38,938
I mean Nabinbabu has taught me...

1508
02:01:38,938 --> 02:01:40,563
Who knows that?

1509
02:01:40,563 --> 02:01:41,730
What do you mean?

1510
02:01:41,730 --> 02:01:45,897
I mean give Banikbabu the rosogolla
made by you.

1511
02:01:59,063 --> 02:02:02,855
Can a dog's stomach digest butter?

1512
02:02:02,855 --> 02:02:09,563
Is it fair to give the moon to a person who
doesn't understand its worth?

1513
02:02:09,563 --> 02:02:11,397
No! It's not fair!

1514
02:02:11,397 --> 02:02:13,022
Not good at all!

1515
02:02:14,641 --> 02:02:15,725
The sweet.

1516
02:02:17,938 --> 02:02:19,938
Have you tasted the Rosogolla
made by Nobinbabu?

1517
02:02:19,938 --> 02:02:21,980
If you did,
you would have known.

1518
02:02:21,980 --> 02:02:26,730
One who can make that Rosogolla,
let me try to get the moon for him first …

1519
02:02:26,730 --> 02:02:31,938
then we can think of this dwarf!
Bye!

1520
02:02:31,938 --> 02:02:34,022
Excuse me brother!

1521
02:02:37,063 --> 02:02:39,563
Will you taste one?

1522
02:02:46,813 --> 02:02:50,313
If at all I have,
I'll have the original.

1523
02:02:52,147 --> 02:02:54,397
Impressive!

1524
02:02:55,105 --> 02:02:58,438
Female entrepreneur!
This is future – right?

1525
02:02:58,438 --> 02:03:01,355
Nice meeting you!
I'm a patent agent.

1526
02:03:01,355 --> 02:03:03,188
What tet?

1527
02:03:03,188 --> 02:03:06,397
Sweet! Not tet … it's patent.

1528
02:03:06,397 --> 02:03:08,147
Patent.

1529
02:03:08,147 --> 02:03:15,897
In future, in this entire world, whoever makes
this Rosogolla, you'll get the royalty.

1530
02:03:17,480 --> 02:03:19,938
True?
Oh yes!

1531
02:03:19,938 --> 02:03:23,272
I don't want to listen to your words!
You'll have to patent it.

1532
02:03:23,272 --> 02:03:24,730
I'll not patent it.

1533
02:03:24,730 --> 02:03:26,688
Why? What's your problem?

1534
02:03:26,688 --> 02:03:28,063
Try to understand for once!

1535
02:03:28,063 --> 02:03:29,938
I taught so many people hands on.

1536
02:03:29,938 --> 02:03:33,147
Now if I ask money from them,
will it not be duping them?

1537
02:03:33,147 --> 02:03:38,355
This is as if I give seeds to a
farmer and ask him to grow crops …

1538
02:03:38,355 --> 02:03:43,397
and then I say – you'll never be able
to grow crops without my seeds …

1539
02:03:43,397 --> 02:03:44,480
That's not done!

1540
02:03:44,480 --> 02:03:48,897
Hey! Where are you going?
But … but my coconut?

1541
02:03:48,897 --> 02:03:52,355
So you'll not patent it?

1542
02:03:52,355 --> 02:03:55,605
No! He's not agreeing to it in any way.

1543
02:03:55,605 --> 02:03:57,355
Bad! Very bad!

1544
02:03:57,355 --> 02:04:00,313
In reality, you've actually made
it for the first time!

1545
02:04:00,313 --> 02:04:02,772
And now everyone can do it!

1546
02:04:02,772 --> 02:04:07,813
If any of them gets the patents,
then Rosogolla will belong to him.

1547
02:04:07,813 --> 02:04:14,188
Then you have to buy Rosogolla
that you've invented!

1548
02:04:14,188 --> 02:04:15,022
Bye!

1549
02:04:17,938 --> 02:04:19,688
What are you doing Khirod?

1550
02:04:19,688 --> 02:04:22,105
I'll not listen to you...
will you take the patent or not?

1551
02:04:22,105 --> 02:04:24,855
Why are you getting so angry?
Why not?

1552
02:04:24,855 --> 02:04:27,813
We'll have to pay for
what we've made?

1553
02:04:27,813 --> 02:04:29,147
Who's putting weird things
in your head?

1554
02:04:29,147 --> 02:04:30,272
Dad, will you play with me?

1555
02:04:30,272 --> 02:04:32,938
Go! Go away from here!

1556
02:04:33,730 --> 02:04:36,230
Wonderful!

1557
02:04:36,230 --> 02:04:39,022
Ok! What do the people whom
you teach give you?

1558
02:04:39,022 --> 02:04:40,730
Nothing more than a wrapper!

1559
02:04:40,730 --> 02:04:45,855
Khirod, I'm telling you for the last time...
listen to me carefully …

1560
02:04:45,855 --> 02:04:48,188
If I ask for money from
the persons I've taught,

1561
02:04:48,188 --> 02:04:52,563
people will think I've taught
them for personal gain!

1562
02:04:52,563 --> 02:04:56,105
You always hanker for your name…
you want people to praise you always!

1563
02:04:56,105 --> 02:04:58,022
What did you say?
What do you want?

1564
02:04:58,022 --> 02:04:59,897
Do you want us to starve?

1565
02:04:59,897 --> 02:05:04,313
If you do not take the patent,
I'll go to my father's house and take Khoka along…

1566
02:05:04,313 --> 02:05:07,605
and will never return.
I will...

1567
02:05:07,605 --> 02:05:09,563
never take... Patent!

1568
02:05:10,522 --> 02:05:20,730
As dark as the black bumblebee

1569
02:05:20,730 --> 02:05:25,272
my friend, when will you come,

1570
02:05:25,272 --> 02:05:30,272
tell me, oh tell me!

1571
02:05:56,522 --> 02:05:59,647
Khirod! Open the door please!

1572
02:05:59,647 --> 02:06:01,230
Have you taken the patent?

1573
02:06:01,230 --> 02:06:04,480
Why this same issue...

1574
02:06:04,480 --> 02:06:11,021
Your wife will tolerate all your whims
… not a mother.

1575
02:06:11,823 --> 02:06:17,188
You had promised me
you would not make me cry any more?

1576
02:06:18,438 --> 02:06:20,772
Answer me...

1577
02:06:20,772 --> 02:06:27,480
If you want to go, my friend...
Leave back the towel on your shoulder!

1578
02:06:59,355 --> 02:07:01,938
Hey!
Give me five Rosogollas...

1579
02:07:01,938 --> 02:07:04,272
Hi Hemen!
After such a long time?

1580
02:07:04,272 --> 02:07:05,938
Give me five Rosogollas.
I'll take them along!

1581
02:07:05,938 --> 02:07:08,647
You've come after so many days!
Come inside!

1582
02:07:08,647 --> 02:07:11,438
Not for me! It's for Kalibabu …

1583
02:07:11,438 --> 02:07:14,147
I was forbidden to tell you!

1584
02:07:14,147 --> 02:07:16,438
Please do not tell anyone!
Kalibabu will have it?

1585
02:07:16,438 --> 02:07:20,147
Hey Nobin! Come soon!

1586
02:07:20,147 --> 02:07:23,313
Kalibabu will have Rosogolla!

1587
02:07:23,313 --> 02:07:25,563
I haven't said anything!

1588
02:07:50,022 --> 02:07:54,438
Now price of milk is the same throughout
Kolkata. What else do you want?

1589
02:07:54,438 --> 02:07:56,647
No…

1590
02:07:56,647 --> 02:08:00,230
I've come to feed you Rosogolla!

1591
02:08:00,230 --> 02:08:01,605
Me?

1592
02:08:01,605 --> 02:08:03,105
Why?

1593
02:08:03,980 --> 02:08:05,938
Everyone says...

1594
02:08:05,938 --> 02:08:09,397
at bad times one needs
the blessings of elders!

1595
02:08:09,397 --> 02:08:10,438
That's why …

1596
02:08:12,980 --> 02:08:16,480
Sales of your shop is so high...

1597
02:08:16,480 --> 02:08:19,063
and you talk of bad time!

1598
02:08:19,063 --> 02:08:20,938
Khirod is not there at home …

1599
02:08:23,355 --> 02:08:25,188
What shall I do with the high sale?

1600
02:08:30,938 --> 02:08:33,063
Take!

1601
02:09:05,605 --> 02:09:08,188
All right! That's all right!

1602
02:09:16,647 --> 02:09:19,897
May I leave?
Yes!

1603
02:09:21,688 --> 02:09:23,272
Wait!

1604
02:09:33,938 --> 02:09:36,313
Will you teach me...?

1605
02:09:36,313 --> 02:09:41,355
Messenger of God...

1606
02:09:43,855 --> 02:09:45,355
Hey! Go!

1607
02:09:45,355 --> 02:09:47,522
A good beating will make you right!

1608
02:09:47,522 --> 02:09:48,897
Bipin! What's this going on?

1609
02:09:48,897 --> 02:09:51,647
Bipin! What's this going on?

1610
02:09:51,647 --> 02:09:54,813
Dada! He's disturbing since long!
I don't want to listen to anything!

1611
02:09:54,813 --> 02:09:57,980
Never behave like this
and give him some water!

1612
02:09:59,813 --> 02:10:01,188
Dada!

1613
02:10:03,897 --> 02:10:06,647
Nobin Kishore...

1614
02:10:16,980 --> 02:10:20,397
Have some water!

1615
02:10:20,397 --> 02:10:22,397
Slow! Slow!

1616
02:10:23,563 --> 02:10:25,063
Drink slowly!

1617
02:10:27,688 --> 02:10:32,022
I've been the cause of
a great loss for you!

1618
02:10:32,022 --> 02:10:33,855
That's all right!

1619
02:10:33,855 --> 02:10:36,272
The time was not ripe for business.

1620
02:10:36,272 --> 02:10:39,397
No!

1621
02:10:39,397 --> 02:10:43,730
There was nothing wrong in your sweet.

1622
02:10:43,730 --> 02:10:50,605
By mistake, my opium balls had
fallen in it from my pocket.

1623
02:10:51,730 --> 02:10:56,855
I was scared to tell you that!

1624
02:10:56,855 --> 02:11:02,105
Pardon me!
Pardon me please!

1625
02:11:02,105 --> 02:11:05,855
Maheshdada! It was right!

1626
02:11:05,855 --> 02:11:08,355
My sweet was absolutely right,
Maheshdada!

1627
02:11:08,355 --> 02:11:11,938
Chondubabu, you do not
know what good you've done to me!

1628
02:11:11,938 --> 02:11:14,230
I'll make new sweet now!

1629
02:11:15,188 --> 02:11:18,188
I'll pacify Khirod with the new sweet
and bring her back.

1630
02:11:18,188 --> 02:11:19,980
After all, our relationship is only
about sweet... isn't it?

1631
02:11:19,980 --> 02:11:20,730
Of course.

1632
02:11:20,730 --> 02:11:23,188
Chondubabu, what's your name?

1633
02:11:23,188 --> 02:11:24,397
Chondu.

1634
02:11:24,397 --> 02:11:25,480
No no! Your good name!

1635
02:11:25,480 --> 02:11:32,022
After ma died, no one called me by
that name for many years now!

1636
02:11:32,022 --> 02:11:34,267
We'll call you … just tell us!

1637
02:11:34,384 --> 02:11:37,897
Boikuntha Gangopadhyay …

1638
02:11:37,897 --> 02:11:40,313
I'll give your name to my sweet…

1639
02:11:40,313 --> 02:11:41,480
...is it ok?

1640
02:11:41,823 --> 02:11:43,573
'Boikunthabhog'!

1641
02:11:43,657 --> 02:11:45,188
Nobin!

1642
02:11:45,188 --> 02:11:48,563
See! The streak of madness
has returned!

1643
02:11:48,563 --> 02:11:49,688
But you do not go away!

1644
02:11:51,147 --> 02:11:57,022
Listen! Get him shaved and
dressed properly!

1645
02:12:04,730 --> 02:12:06,522
Khirod...

1646
02:12:06,522 --> 02:12:07,855
Khirod, I've come!

1647
02:12:07,855 --> 02:12:12,397
I know you do not want to see
my nose, lips, eyes … nothing!

1648
02:12:12,397 --> 02:12:18,355
Don't you know how inauspicious
it is if I don't feed you first?

1649
02:12:18,355 --> 02:12:20,147
Take this! Just smell it!

1650
02:12:20,147 --> 02:12:24,105
I've made this new sweet!
'Boikunthabhog'!

1651
02:12:24,105 --> 02:12:25,855
Oh! What an aroma!

1652
02:12:25,855 --> 02:12:30,397
If I didn't have to feed you first,
I myself would have taken it!

1653
02:12:30,397 --> 02:12:33,897
Please Khirod!
Don't do like that!

1654
02:12:33,897 --> 02:12:35,105
Just hold it!

1655
02:12:35,105 --> 02:12:37,272
Have been running the entire life!

1656
02:12:37,272 --> 02:12:38,105
Khirod!

1657
02:12:38,105 --> 02:12:40,563
Please don't do like that!
Please try to understand!

1658
02:12:40,563 --> 02:12:42,813
Don't get angry!
Khirod! I've understood!

1659
02:12:42,813 --> 02:12:45,147
Patent! Isn't it?

1660
02:12:45,147 --> 02:12:48,105
We didn't have anything…

1661
02:12:48,105 --> 02:12:49,313
Now we've so much!

1662
02:12:49,313 --> 02:12:51,813
We've our house,
our shop, our sweet …

1663
02:12:51,813 --> 02:12:52,980
We've our son …

1664
02:12:54,563 --> 02:12:56,355
What do you think?

1665
02:13:01,230 --> 02:13:02,480
Think!

1666
02:13:02,480 --> 02:13:05,188
Instead of these hands,
if another man's hands held you!

1667
02:13:05,188 --> 02:13:06,313
Go! Nothing stops you
from saying things!

1668
02:13:06,313 --> 02:13:07,230
Don't feel ashamed?

1669
02:13:07,230 --> 02:13:08,938
Exactly … I'm saying that only …

1670
02:13:08,938 --> 02:13:13,730
Whoever makes Rosogolla
in the entire world...

1671
02:13:13,730 --> 02:13:18,897
Nobin's hands will be Nobin's only!

1672
02:13:20,230 --> 02:13:24,022
I'll make many more new and
newer sweet Khirod!

1673
02:13:24,022 --> 02:13:26,230
Only you be with me!

1674
02:13:26,230 --> 02:13:27,730
Look at this...

1675
02:13:27,730 --> 02:13:30,730
'Boikunthabhog'!

1676
02:13:30,730 --> 02:13:33,272
I made it!

1677
02:13:56,313 --> 02:13:57,938
When will you grow up my dear?

1678
02:13:58,647 --> 02:14:01,397
What do I gain in growing up?

1679
02:14:02,980 --> 02:14:04,563
You're there – isn't it?

1680
02:14:05,772 --> 02:14:08,063
With what did you make
this 'Boikunthabhog'?

1681
02:14:09,813 --> 02:14:12,022
With love...

1682
02:14:28,230 --> 02:14:31,897
This is all about the glory...
There ends my story!
