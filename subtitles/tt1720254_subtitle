00:07:55,975 --> 00:08:00,412
who understands women better then
me?

35
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:04,676
women are very curious about
their age.

36
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:09,043
l start with that..
are you her mom?

37
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:15,519
l would agree if you would say she
is your sister.

38
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:17,585
are you kidding right?

39
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:31,676

how she looks.

40
00:08:35,815 --> 00:08:39,808

can l?

43
00:08:49,562 --> 00:08:53,555
then what she came to cancel the deal
and in the end she bought 2 yurt.

44
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:03,641
l feel jealous with you guys..
why? because you never get caught.

45
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:12,342
l go caught, and l never find out
who was that friend of my wife.

46
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:15,816
who spy on me, and destroy my peace.

47
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:29,393

48
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,200

before coming home.

50
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:43,807
l just ask because l was happy..

00:09:44,817 --> 00:09:49,117

is this cup of tea or world cup?

55
00:10:12,678 --> 00:10:23,612
don't you think the tea will get cold
when you get the saucer?

56
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:26,320
then l will make it hot.

57
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:32,997
tea become poison when you heat up
again, its better if you give me poison.

58
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:41,504
so l will make new tea.

l will talk to you later.

67
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:28,647

72
00:11:51,677 --> 00:11:55,010
l know you caught him once with a girl.

73
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:59,981
l can not forget when he did to me..
then why don't you leave him?

74
00:12:00,352 --> 00:12:08,191
my friend told me not to get new dog.

75
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,692
what if l get bigger dog then this?

76
00:12:14,266 --> 00:12:19,226
and those dogs don't have loyalty.

77
00:12:20,306 --> 00:12:21,534
my Raj is not like that.

78
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:28,579
you bought this necklace, you have the same
yes, l buy it as buy one get one free.

79
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:29,513
buy one get one free.

80
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,885
Raj didn't gave you other necklace?

81
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:36,455
mean he gave away the free necklace
to someone else?

82
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:44,887

out who he gave the other necklace?

83
00:13:02,047 --> 00:13:06,347

Raj is having affair with someone.

86
00:13:19,398 --> 00:13:25,234
no it cant be..
then why he didn't told you about 2 necklace?

87
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:28,098
maybe he forget to tell me.

88
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:37,139
they show us free toothbrush, but he
forget to tell you about the free necklace?

89
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:44,511
its better l didn't allow her to ask with
Raj otherwise he would make her fool again.

90
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:47,624
l am his wife, he only loves me.

91
00:13:49,061 --> 00:13:55,557
everyman keeps the spare tyre.

92
00:13:56,068 --> 00:13:59,595
my yogi parked the car, and he use
to go with stepney only.

93
00:14:00,372 --> 00:14:03,170
l fear this fire will reach to my
house too.

94
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:08,403
first Yogi and then Raj, he would
be next anytime.

95
00:14:09,281 --> 00:14:14,776
two are bitter then third one would
never be sweets.

96
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:22,018

00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:50,133
where is your friend?

104
00:18:03,615 --> 00:18:07,551

what she don't have?

106
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:15,158
she is tall, she is pretty..

107
00:18:15,694 --> 00:18:19,790
women become hassle for man you know
when?

108
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:27,734
when she become wife, you husband
become blind.

109
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:33,301
get here to the garden, l will be
there.

110
00:18:38,183 --> 00:18:39,980
don't worry l will take care
of everything.

111
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:47,756
what kind of man he is, how rubbish
he was talking to me..

112
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:52,664
l think he knows something about
Raj that's why maybe.

113
00:18:53,398 --> 00:18:58,927
there are many man..

114
00:19:00,105 --> 00:19:02,869
but your husband see only women.

115
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:06,270
get inside, l have to tell you
something.

116
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:10,414
and the reason is not Raj its the
weather problem.

117
00:19:14,553 --> 00:19:17,954
what is Summer has to do?
all of it.

118
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:22,423
check history 88% divorce and breakup
occur in summer time.

119
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:26,856
because in winter all women look alike.

120
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:38,137
they all covered, and in summer girls wear
small cloths and then necklace could be given.

121
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:45,640
man like his own kids and he likes
other's wife.

122
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:53,720
but Raj is not like that,
there is something call experience.

123
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:59,387
l have solved 1 13 case, and in 1 1 1
case women were right.

125
00:20:09,274 --> 00:20:18,012
why you women don't check your husband's
mobile bill, it has a lot.

126
00:20:19,585 --> 00:20:25,785
the number l marked in red are girls

l am telling her the plan.

480
01:17:15,063 --> 01:17:17,190
l cant do all this.

481
01:17:18,533 --> 01:17:22,663
Raj can keep girlfriend but you cant
keep fake boyfriend?

482
01:17:23,271 --> 01:17:29,608
when wife get involve in any case..

483

he made you cry, don't worry now
its our turn.

485
01:17:41,223 --> 01:17:45,057
idea is not bad, but you became
the fake boyfriend?

486
01:17:48,296 --> 01:17:57,170
Sanjana wanted the smart and handsome
guy so..

487
01:17:57,672 --> 01:18:01,699
l made myself her boyfriend.

488
01:18:02,077 --> 01:18:03,738
what else you will do for us?

489
01:18:07,215 --> 01:18:10,446
but how Raj will know about you?

490
01:18:10,652 --> 01:18:14,748
Yogi will tell him.

491
01:18:22,030 --> 01:18:22,462

495
01:18:41,216 --> 01:18:45,050
l think he is gone mad,
no me he is going to mad.

496
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:48,216
Sanjan fall in love.

497
01:18:49,991 --> 01:18:52,585
what are you saying?
l saw with my own eyes.

498
01:18:54,529 --> 01:18:56,588
l heard all.

499
01:18:57,599 --> 01:19:02,627
she was whispering to him, she was
laughing.

500
01:19:03,738 --> 01:19:07,469
and she was hugging him.

501
01:19:10,011 --> 01:19:12,809
this is not an issue maybe he is
an old friend.

502
01:19:13,181 --> 01:19:18,642
l know how we hug friend, there is
always gape between.

503
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:20,951
there was not even space of air.

504
01:19:27,996 --> 01:19:30,760
do you think its that master mind..

505
01:19:31,900 --> 01:19:34,528
let me find out.

506
01:19:35,971 --> 01:19:39,532
who was that man?
l didn't saw he face but he was handsome.

507
01:19:39,941 --> 01:19:43,342
he didn't see the face,
so there is something call personality.

508
01:29:24,458 --> 01:29:25,186
its his fault.

509
01:29:26,460 --> 01:29:31,762
you know all the women but you don't
know you own wife.

510
01:29:34,101 --> 01:29:41,769
l couldn't, that why people say
no one can understand women.

511
01:29:43,978 --> 01:29:49,712
but we must understand those three guys.

512
01:29:56,390 --> 01:30:00,451
you did a lot for me.

513
01:30:02,229 --> 01:30:05,221
l had to show him that.

514
01:30:09,537 --> 01:30:10,663
l will call you in a while.

02:04:37,936 --> 02:04:41,235
l knew l had to solve this case with smile.

691
02:04:42,374 --> 02:04:45,138

692
02:04:47,479 --> 02:04:53,975
