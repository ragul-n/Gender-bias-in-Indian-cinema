1
00:04:21,195 --> 00:04:22,355
Father's had a stroke

2
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:24,092
You handle things here, l...

3
00:04:24,163 --> 00:04:25,152
Go, go

4
00:04:31,362 --> 00:04:32,192
Hi Prasanna

5
00:04:33,129 --> 00:04:34,095
Uncle Gaju?

6
00:04:34,796 --> 00:04:35,262
When?

7
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:39,923
OK

8
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:41,227
I'll be there

9
00:04:59,696 --> 00:05:00,685
No. It's not her

10
00:05:01,029 --> 00:05:01,927
It's my father

11
00:05:02,396 --> 00:05:03,156
What time did she say?

12
00:05:03,228 --> 00:05:03,887
Call her

13
00:05:06,762 --> 00:05:08,250
These are the channeIs
that we spoke to

14
00:05:08,329 --> 00:05:09,352
They've all agreed

15
00:05:09,629 --> 00:05:11,857
They said they will broadcast...

16
00:05:12,096 --> 00:05:12,857
Wait

17
00:05:17,629 --> 00:05:18,118
No luck, sir

18
00:05:18,396 --> 00:05:19,384
Sir, she's here

19
00:05:19,761 --> 00:05:20,751
She's here?

20
00:05:21,329 --> 00:05:22,386
I'm so sorry, RK

21
00:05:22,662 --> 00:05:24,150
This time I was almost on time

22
00:05:24,228 --> 00:05:25,819
But Ganpati traffic,
you know how it is

23
00:05:25,895 --> 00:05:26,828
It's OK. It's cool

24
00:05:26,896 --> 00:05:27,987
Actually, I'm just anxious

25
00:05:28,063 --> 00:05:28,722
Me too

26
00:05:28,896 --> 00:05:29,918
This is the first screening

27
00:05:29,995 --> 00:05:31,086
I know

28
00:05:31,162 --> 00:05:32,322
Sir, it's your father on the phone

29
00:05:33,262 --> 00:05:34,229
Tell him I'll call him back

30
00:05:34,296 --> 00:05:35,783
Talk to him,
it could be something important

31
00:05:37,062 --> 00:05:37,994
I'll explain

32
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:41,091
You know, he calIs
me for every small thing

33
00:05:41,262 --> 00:05:43,194
If the gardener's late, he'll call me

34
00:05:43,395 --> 00:05:44,088
How sweet!

35
00:05:44,162 --> 00:05:47,288
Yes, but I wonder how
he tracks me down

36
00:05:47,362 --> 00:05:50,259
I didn't answer my cell phone,
so he called here

37
00:05:51,062 --> 00:05:51,960
Let me tell you something

38
00:05:52,661 --> 00:05:53,628
Take it from me

39
00:05:54,128 --> 00:05:54,959
Dads...

40
00:05:55,962 --> 00:05:56,792
are very special

41
00:05:58,795 --> 00:05:59,626
I know that

42
00:06:00,295 --> 00:06:00,988
Come

43
00:06:04,195 --> 00:06:06,127
So that's the best seat in the house

44
00:06:06,194 --> 00:06:07,592
Alright
- The second one

45
00:06:08,228 --> 00:06:09,661
I'm excited, RK

46
00:06:09,729 --> 00:06:11,195
Yeah, me too, because you're seeing it

47
00:06:11,895 --> 00:06:13,691
Jai, volume should be 6.5

48
00:06:14,329 --> 00:06:15,591
Can I just take this?

49
00:06:15,662 --> 00:06:16,560
Yes, of course, please

50
00:06:18,262 --> 00:06:18,921
Hello Dada

51
00:06:19,761 --> 00:06:20,319
What is it?

52
00:06:20,595 --> 00:06:21,220
ATE/Thing urgent?

53
00:06:21,295 --> 00:06:22,260
Nothing major but...

54
00:06:22,328 --> 00:06:23,556
Uncle Gaju's been hospitalized

55
00:06:23,628 --> 00:06:24,685
No baby, thank you very much

56
00:06:26,028 --> 00:06:26,892
When was this?

57
00:06:26,962 --> 00:06:27,928
Which hospital is it?

58
00:06:27,995 --> 00:06:28,961
About an hour back

59
00:06:29,628 --> 00:06:30,288
Kohinoor hospital

60
00:06:30,962 --> 00:06:31,951
He's on the ventilator

61
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:35,822
Can I come there after this screening?

62
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:36,827
Yeah, no problem

63
00:06:36,895 --> 00:06:38,952
I'll update you once I reach there

64
00:06:39,028 --> 00:06:40,960
OK thanks. Great

65
00:06:41,028 --> 00:06:42,324
Bye

66
00:06:48,095 --> 00:06:49,754
OK. We can start

67
00:07:01,695 --> 00:07:02,559
You know l...

68
00:07:03,828 --> 00:07:04,850
I think you must go

69
00:07:05,594 --> 00:07:06,492
I should, right?

70
00:07:06,928 --> 00:07:08,917
You know because it's my uncle and...

71
00:07:08,995 --> 00:07:09,789
he's very close to me

72
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:11,725
Of course, RK. Please go

73
00:07:12,494 --> 00:07:13,619
Thanks
- OK

74
00:07:13,928 --> 00:07:14,860
Please sit

75
00:07:15,761 --> 00:07:16,852
Utsav, Renu

76
00:07:18,895 --> 00:07:19,588
Bye

77
00:07:19,661 --> 00:07:20,093
Bye

78
00:07:20,661 --> 00:07:21,752
I'll be back soon

79
00:07:21,828 --> 00:07:22,851
Yes, alright

80
00:07:26,161 --> 00:07:27,059
Hi Dada

81
00:07:27,127 --> 00:07:28,184
I am on my way there

82
00:07:28,828 --> 00:07:30,487
I'll fetch you at the circle

83
00:07:30,561 --> 00:07:31,493
OK?

84
00:07:33,061 --> 00:07:34,789
Sir, your father called

85
00:07:34,995 --> 00:07:36,926
He said Uncle Gaju is very ill

86
00:07:37,061 --> 00:07:37,993
Yes, he called me too

87
00:07:38,061 --> 00:07:39,027
I'll call him

88
00:07:39,094 --> 00:07:42,152
When you don't answer his calIs,
he starts calling all of us

89
00:07:43,494 --> 00:07:44,585
He does that a lot

90
00:07:45,128 --> 00:07:47,855
I don't know if it's
an emergency or just regular stuff

91
00:07:50,161 --> 00:07:51,128
Here he is

92
00:07:53,494 --> 00:07:54,960
Yes, I already know

93
00:07:55,027 --> 00:07:56,051
I am on my way there

94
00:07:56,128 --> 00:07:57,957
I am just about to leave

95
00:07:58,027 --> 00:07:59,221
Why are you coming there?

96
00:07:59,494 --> 00:08:01,018
I know you'll take a bus

97
00:08:01,528 --> 00:08:02,891
In fact you go ahead,
I won't go at all

98
00:08:02,961 --> 00:08:05,485
Gaju is on the ventilator

99
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:07,656
Dad

100
00:08:07,728 --> 00:08:09,853
Alright, you go on

101
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:13,417
Will you call and inform
everyone in the village or should I?

102
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:14,823
I'll call them

103
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:16,827
Don't start calling
everyone up, please

104
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:17,656
I'm going to hang up now

105
00:08:17,728 --> 00:08:19,819
Bye. Call me back...

106
00:08:41,527 --> 00:08:43,790
R-A-J -A

107
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,792
Uncle Raja

108
00:08:46,961 --> 00:08:48,428
Hello Uncle Raja

109
00:08:48,494 --> 00:08:51,051
Gundya, how are you?

110
00:08:51,193 --> 00:08:52,183
Where's your father?

111
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:54,518
I'll get him on the phone

112
00:08:54,828 --> 00:08:56,657
Just wait

113
00:08:56,794 --> 00:08:59,124
Uncle Raja's call, Uncle Raja's call

114
00:08:59,194 --> 00:09:00,024
Ready?

115
00:09:00,094 --> 00:09:01,958
Jump in. No, wait

116
00:09:02,027 --> 00:09:04,084
Careful, you'll hurt yourself

117
00:09:04,694 --> 00:09:05,354
Ready?

118
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:07,592
One

119
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:08,956
Father, Uncle Raja's on the phone

120
00:09:09,027 --> 00:09:10,391
Two

121
00:09:10,461 --> 00:09:12,483
Uncle Raja's on the phone

122
00:09:16,728 --> 00:09:17,716
Here

123
00:09:18,527 --> 00:09:19,085
One moment

124
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,588
Is anyone drowning?

125
00:09:22,527 --> 00:09:24,926
Hi Raja. How are you?

126
00:09:25,894 --> 00:09:27,621
You'll be here for Ganpati this year,
won't you?

127
00:09:27,694 --> 00:09:29,592
Yes, most probably, I'll be there

128
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,990
Have you heard about Uncle Gajanan?

129
00:09:32,061 --> 00:09:34,425
He is going to be here for Ganpati

130
00:09:34,493 --> 00:09:36,653
Ladies, one moment

131
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:38,592
What is the matter?

132
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:39,785
He is critically ill

133
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:41,485
He's been hospitalized

134
00:09:41,994 --> 00:09:43,085
Really?

135
00:09:44,093 --> 00:09:46,117
Now, what next?

136
00:09:46,393 --> 00:09:47,917
Dada and I are on
our way to the hospital

137
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,484
Will you please inform Uncle Bandhu?

138
00:10:01,593 --> 00:10:02,923
Bandhu

139
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:05,688
Go back, back

140
00:10:07,126 --> 00:10:08,059
Manner-less

141
00:10:08,627 --> 00:10:09,389
You're dripping

142
00:10:09,493 --> 00:10:10,584
The floor won't dry up soon enough

143
00:10:10,659 --> 00:10:11,854
Wipe your feet

144
00:10:17,393 --> 00:10:19,587
Tell me, what can be worse than this?

145
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,123
I just spoke to Raja

146
00:10:22,694 --> 00:10:25,353
Uncle Gaju is...

147
00:10:26,592 --> 00:10:27,718
Are you having a stroke?

148
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:28,692
Speak UP

149
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,090
Raja just called me

150
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,848
Uncle Gajanan is critically ill

151
00:10:31,926 --> 00:10:33,415
He's on the ventilator

152
00:10:33,527 --> 00:10:34,823
I see

153
00:10:35,493 --> 00:10:36,549
Is Ashwin there?

154
00:10:36,626 --> 00:10:38,820
Yes, Ashwin and Raja are together

155
00:10:38,893 --> 00:10:40,053
They are on their way to the hospital

156
00:10:40,126 --> 00:10:41,559
I'll leave for Mumbai right away

157
00:10:41,627 --> 00:10:42,990
Get the car, I'll join you

158
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,686
No, you don't have to come along

159
00:10:45,694 --> 00:10:47,126
It's OK, come along

160
00:10:47,693 --> 00:10:49,683
You could keep me company

161
00:10:52,094 --> 00:10:53,684
Not a word to anyone. Got that?

162
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:55,886
Of course not, sir

163
00:10:56,126 --> 00:10:57,388
I'll get the car

164
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:01,983
Uncle Gajanan is critically ill

165
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:03,924
Everyone shut up

166
00:11:03,993 --> 00:11:05,289
Uncle Gajanan is critically ill

167
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,724
He is on the ventilator

168
00:11:06,794 --> 00:11:07,817
I'm leaving for Mumbai

169
00:11:08,693 --> 00:11:09,921
But keep it to yourselves

170
00:11:09,993 --> 00:11:11,482
Ventilator

171
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:14,026
Baba, what is a ventilator?

172
00:11:14,993 --> 00:11:18,483
They shock your brain...

173
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,287
to wake it up

174
00:11:20,359 --> 00:11:24,314
No. It is pressed on
the chest to revive the heart

175
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:25,389
You fool

176
00:11:25,459 --> 00:11:27,789
The ventilator is
inserted in the nose...

177
00:11:27,859 --> 00:11:30,484
in the wind-pipe.
Which helps in breathing

178
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:32,787
Really? Tatya

179
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,622
You must get one for yourself

180
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,682
You will be able
to sing during Ganpati

181
00:11:39,794 --> 00:11:40,782
Play on

182
00:12:05,493 --> 00:12:06,550
<i>Hi Sal</i>

183
00:12:06,693 --> 00:12:07,716
I am here, at the hospital

184
00:12:07,793 --> 00:12:08,486
Where are you?

185
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:09,457
Upstairs

186
00:12:09,626 --> 00:12:10,252
Where?

187
00:12:10,327 --> 00:12:11,724
To your right

188
00:12:11,992 --> 00:12:12,857
I have arranged for the money

189
00:12:12,925 --> 00:12:13,915
Don't worry

190
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:18,725
Here already?

191
00:12:18,793 --> 00:12:19,691
Wait

192
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:23,356
How much is it?

193
00:12:23,693 --> 00:12:24,488
One lakh

194
00:12:26,993 --> 00:12:27,981
It's donation money...

195
00:12:28,825 --> 00:12:30,349
This is the Lord's way of helping you

196
00:12:30,793 --> 00:12:32,282
Don't worry. I'll take care of it

197
00:12:32,893 --> 00:12:33,756
Give it to them

198
00:12:34,859 --> 00:12:35,689
This is fifty

199
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:36,884
I'll pay the rest later

200
00:12:40,225 --> 00:12:40,748
Patient's name?

201
00:12:40,826 --> 00:12:41,758
Gajanan Kamerkar

202
00:12:41,826 --> 00:12:44,224
Excuse me. We are in a queue

203
00:12:44,292 --> 00:12:45,452
So are we

204
00:12:45,592 --> 00:12:47,684
That is for the ladies
and this is for gents

205
00:12:48,459 --> 00:12:50,755
Gajanan Kamerkar. ICU bed No. 7

206
00:12:52,326 --> 00:12:52,815
What's going on?

207
00:12:52,893 --> 00:12:54,551
My father is critically ill,
just wait

208
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:55,789
Wait

209
00:12:56,292 --> 00:12:56,884
This is too much

210
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,585
Sai, keep this with you.
We'll need it later

211
00:12:58,659 --> 00:13:00,489
Rude guy

212
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:01,684
Sign here

213
00:13:02,859 --> 00:13:03,791
Sorry

214
00:13:06,192 --> 00:13:07,852
After that bullying,
he says he's sorry

215
00:13:07,926 --> 00:13:09,619
You don't stop them either

216
00:13:10,658 --> 00:13:11,852
That'll be 257/-

217
00:13:11,925 --> 00:13:12,721
What eIse do you need?

218
00:13:12,793 --> 00:13:14,452
Some turmeric

219
00:13:16,292 --> 00:13:16,883
Hello?

220
00:13:17,192 --> 00:13:18,488
Rajah?

221
00:13:19,626 --> 00:13:20,887
Uncle Gajanan is critically ill

222
00:13:21,159 --> 00:13:22,523
He is on the ventilator now

223
00:13:22,725 --> 00:13:23,521
What do you mean?

224
00:13:23,592 --> 00:13:26,183
The truck is here. Unload the stuff

225
00:13:26,259 --> 00:13:29,920
When a patient is at the last stage,
he's put on the ventilator

226
00:13:30,192 --> 00:13:30,920
I'm leaving for Mumbai

227
00:13:31,192 --> 00:13:31,817
What about you?

228
00:13:31,892 --> 00:13:33,756
If I lose a single
customer, I'll have to be...

229
00:13:33,825 --> 00:13:36,690
put on a ventilator
till I get him back

230
00:13:36,758 --> 00:13:38,156
You wanted gram flour, didn't you?

231
00:13:38,225 --> 00:13:39,487
But we should be with him

232
00:13:40,326 --> 00:13:41,622
In that case,
let's leave later in the evening

233
00:13:41,693 --> 00:13:43,556
As it is, I had to
buy supplies from Mumbai

234
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:45,149
We could go together

235
00:13:45,225 --> 00:13:48,851
What if he passes away by then?

236
00:13:48,925 --> 00:13:50,255
What about Ganpati?

237
00:13:50,526 --> 00:13:51,549
We'll be in mourning

238
00:13:51,626 --> 00:13:53,921
Can you hear yourself?

239
00:13:54,192 --> 00:13:56,386
Will they bring the body
to the village or keep it in Mumbai?

240
00:13:56,492 --> 00:13:58,355
Where will they get
Uncle Gajanan's body?

241
00:13:58,925 --> 00:14:01,221
"I'm hanging up, Raja"

242
00:14:06,626 --> 00:14:08,217
Stop it

243
00:14:08,858 --> 00:14:09,756
Stop it

244
00:14:10,192 --> 00:14:11,158
Stop crying

245
00:14:11,758 --> 00:14:13,589
He is still alive. He's not dead yet

246
00:14:13,659 --> 00:14:16,784
For Ganpati, Lata is coming
all the way from the USA

247
00:14:16,858 --> 00:14:18,621
Yes Aunty...

248
00:14:18,693 --> 00:14:20,590
If he passes away,
what happens to Ganpati?

249
00:14:21,259 --> 00:14:22,782
Ganpati is only 7 days away

250
00:14:22,858 --> 00:14:24,325
We'll be in mourning

251
00:14:24,425 --> 00:14:27,483
I'll go to Mumbai and
find out what is happening

252
00:14:27,558 --> 00:14:30,320
Till then,
keep this news to yourselves

253
00:14:30,425 --> 00:14:31,823
Where's Bhiku?

254
00:14:32,092 --> 00:14:32,683
Yes?

255
00:14:32,758 --> 00:14:34,657
Don't you dare tell anyone

256
00:14:35,224 --> 00:14:37,157
No, I won't

257
00:14:37,792 --> 00:14:39,486
We'll come with you

258
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:44,289
Wait

259
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:47,148
Bhau, she must have left the USA

260
00:14:47,224 --> 00:14:50,487
Once she lands in London,
she'll call us

261
00:14:50,725 --> 00:14:51,486
OK?

262
00:14:52,792 --> 00:14:54,349
Hi Raja. How are you?

263
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:55,254
First class

264
00:14:55,492 --> 00:14:56,355
Dada, you're looking good

265
00:14:56,824 --> 00:14:57,518
Really?

266
00:14:58,558 --> 00:14:59,081
Thank you

267
00:14:59,125 --> 00:14:59,750
Shiva, let's go

268
00:15:00,326 --> 00:15:02,485
So, what did my father say?

269
00:15:02,692 --> 00:15:05,750
That he is glad you are coming with me

270
00:15:06,025 --> 00:15:08,184
And Uncle Gaju has done a lot for you

271
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:09,390
This is true

272
00:15:10,425 --> 00:15:12,255
When I first came to Mumbai...

273
00:15:12,325 --> 00:15:13,689
I didn't get hostel accommodation

274
00:15:14,158 --> 00:15:16,682
For the first year,
I stayed at Uncle Gaju's home

275
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:19,451
Uncle Gaju just picked up my bags...

276
00:15:19,725 --> 00:15:20,748
and took me home

277
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:24,250
He insisted that I stay with
him till I could find myself a place

278
00:15:25,525 --> 00:15:26,457
What a guy!

279
00:15:31,124 --> 00:15:33,715
There, I'm sure the
entire village knows by now

280
00:15:34,191 --> 00:15:35,089
Kanchan

281
00:15:37,158 --> 00:15:38,319
Yes Kanchan?

282
00:15:38,624 --> 00:15:39,715
Dada, what is the situation?

283
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:40,690
Dada, namaste

284
00:15:40,758 --> 00:15:41,724
He is on the ventilator

285
00:15:41,792 --> 00:15:43,690
We can go ahead with the
Ganapati celebrations, right?

286
00:15:44,191 --> 00:15:45,419
How can I say for sure?

287
00:15:45,491 --> 00:15:46,685
Am I God?

288
00:15:47,058 --> 00:15:50,081
No, I mean this is my first
year as the committee head for Ganpati

289
00:15:50,158 --> 00:15:52,181
Sir, water?

290
00:15:53,025 --> 00:15:55,752
If Uncle Gaju passes away,
we'll be in mourning

291
00:15:56,024 --> 00:15:57,457
I can't go near the idol

292
00:15:57,525 --> 00:15:59,423
The volunteers will be dejected

293
00:15:59,491 --> 00:16:00,979
They have already spent a lot

294
00:16:01,058 --> 00:16:02,047
That is my only worry

295
00:16:02,124 --> 00:16:03,147
Is Prasanna there?

296
00:16:03,224 --> 00:16:03,986
Could you hand him the phone?

297
00:16:04,058 --> 00:16:05,285
He isn't answering my calIs

298
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:06,720
Prasanna is at the hospital

299
00:16:06,991 --> 00:16:08,719
Please don't pester him

300
00:16:08,991 --> 00:16:10,548
I'll let you know
what is going on here

301
00:16:11,091 --> 00:16:11,682
OK?

302
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:13,152
Let me know

303
00:16:13,224 --> 00:16:14,952
Sure

304
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:16,622
What did he say?

305
00:16:25,525 --> 00:16:26,388
Nandan

306
00:16:28,224 --> 00:16:29,247
Yes Nandan?

307
00:16:29,325 --> 00:16:31,654
Dada, how is Uncle Gaja?

308
00:16:33,058 --> 00:16:34,683
Mother is already weeping here

309
00:16:35,058 --> 00:16:36,320
He is on the ventilator

310
00:16:36,425 --> 00:16:37,390
Let's see

311
00:16:37,624 --> 00:16:38,454
So...

312
00:16:39,425 --> 00:16:40,516
what decision
are you going to take?

313
00:16:41,425 --> 00:16:42,288
I mean...

314
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:43,522
should we leave for Mumbai?

315
00:16:43,724 --> 00:16:45,088
That is up to you

316
00:16:45,158 --> 00:16:47,318
Ganpati is 7 days away

317
00:16:47,624 --> 00:16:48,590
I'm getting the house painted

318
00:16:48,657 --> 00:16:50,420
The outer walIs are still to be done

319
00:16:50,524 --> 00:16:51,991
So what I say is...

320
00:16:52,124 --> 00:16:54,556
why don't you shift
him here to Kolhapur?

321
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:56,720
We have some very good hospitaIs here

322
00:16:56,991 --> 00:16:59,514
Nandan listen to me. You wait there

323
00:16:59,891 --> 00:17:02,983
We'll go to the hospital
and tell the doctors...

324
00:17:03,191 --> 00:17:05,623
that our Nandan
from Kolhapur insists...

325
00:17:05,891 --> 00:17:07,289
that the best
hospital is in Kolhapur

326
00:17:07,358 --> 00:17:08,381
We should shift Uncle Gaju there

327
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:10,049
Yes, you must do that

328
00:17:11,091 --> 00:17:14,148
You hardly ever get out of the city

329
00:17:14,357 --> 00:17:16,517
You'll get a chance to visit Kolhapur

330
00:17:17,457 --> 00:17:18,946
Dada, never mind

331
00:17:19,923 --> 00:17:21,253
Don't speak to the doctor

332
00:17:22,457 --> 00:17:23,424
We are coming to Mumbai

333
00:17:23,491 --> 00:17:25,252
Why? Mom's already in the car?

334
00:17:27,158 --> 00:17:29,987
Bhau, do you want to go the hospital?

335
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:32,482
Should I ask sir
to send the car for you?

336
00:17:32,557 --> 00:17:34,456
But he has asked me not to go there

337
00:17:35,457 --> 00:17:37,890
He has no idea of the
village meeting this year

338
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:41,184
Everyone will get to the hospital now

339
00:17:41,357 --> 00:17:43,051
That is exactly why you
should be there, isn't it?

340
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:45,918
As the wise senior of the family

341
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:48,218
Sir has so many
things to take care of

342
00:17:48,557 --> 00:17:52,319
Shooting, dubbing, editing, writing

343
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:53,615
I won't go right away

344
00:17:55,158 --> 00:17:57,021
Let Raja get there first

345
00:17:59,257 --> 00:18:01,485
It's been many years
since he met the entire family

346
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:04,982
I hope he can handle the chaos

347
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:09,356
Namaste, sir

348
00:18:09,857 --> 00:18:10,823
Namaste

349
00:18:13,023 --> 00:18:14,046
Sir, please

350
00:18:15,157 --> 00:18:16,022
Thank you

351
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:20,279
Raja da

352
00:18:22,091 --> 00:18:23,056
This is a hospital

353
00:18:23,823 --> 00:18:24,483
Where is Prasanna?

354
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:26,351
ICU

355
00:18:27,091 --> 00:18:28,148
Raja, you stay here

356
00:18:28,257 --> 00:18:29,417
Let me check on things

357
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:31,083
Uncle Ravi

358
00:18:31,157 --> 00:18:32,214
How are you Raja?

359
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:33,313
I'm fine, how are you?

360
00:18:33,823 --> 00:18:34,516
Raja is here

361
00:18:35,357 --> 00:18:36,517
Did you recognize me?

362
00:18:37,824 --> 00:18:38,289
Sai?

363
00:18:38,357 --> 00:18:40,187
Yes! Brother!

364
00:18:42,924 --> 00:18:44,084
You are great!

365
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:48,219
What films you make!

366
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:49,449
Superb!

367
00:18:50,389 --> 00:18:54,982
I watch all your films in the theatre,
first-day-first-show!

368
00:18:55,489 --> 00:18:58,081
Bro, in your next film...

369
00:18:58,157 --> 00:18:59,385
this guy wants a role

370
00:18:59,457 --> 00:19:00,251
OK

371
00:19:02,756 --> 00:19:04,280
Remember the theatre in our village?

372
00:19:04,357 --> 00:19:07,085
We would watch films
and enact every scene

373
00:19:07,456 --> 00:19:09,116
I would direct them
- Yes

374
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:11,747
Raja, you've learned so much from me

375
00:19:11,823 --> 00:19:13,085
Well done!

376
00:19:13,157 --> 00:19:14,953
Where is Bhau?

377
00:19:17,856 --> 00:19:18,822
I'll go meet Aunty Manda?

378
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:20,015
Yes, of course

379
00:19:22,356 --> 00:19:24,449
How are you, Aunty Usha,
Aunty Asha?

380
00:19:25,957 --> 00:19:27,855
Come and sit

381
00:19:31,856 --> 00:19:33,151
Namaste

382
00:19:37,856 --> 00:19:38,788
Aunty Manda

383
00:19:44,923 --> 00:19:46,946
He woke up in the morning as usual

384
00:19:48,289 --> 00:19:51,483
Had some tea and biscuits,
and went to the market

385
00:19:53,489 --> 00:19:55,319
Said he'd have breakfast later...

386
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:57,213
eIse the market would get busy

387
00:19:58,223 --> 00:20:00,484
He went to get the Ganpati decorations

388
00:20:04,356 --> 00:20:06,982
In Dadar, the market was
close to our house

389
00:20:07,389 --> 00:20:09,412
In Mahim, everything is far away

390
00:20:12,223 --> 00:20:14,416
You know we've shifted
to a new house, don't you?

391
00:20:15,323 --> 00:20:17,120
We don't live in Dadar anymore

392
00:20:17,189 --> 00:20:18,281
I see

393
00:20:20,489 --> 00:20:22,421
Mahim has a market, doesn't it?

394
00:20:22,489 --> 00:20:23,478
But no...

395
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:27,083
He rushes to Dadar
for even an inch of ginger

396
00:20:27,156 --> 00:20:29,055
I want to see the photos

397
00:20:29,123 --> 00:20:30,282
Hang on

398
00:20:35,157 --> 00:20:36,054
What will you understand?

399
00:20:36,122 --> 00:20:37,282
He didn't get a taxi...

400
00:20:37,356 --> 00:20:40,085
so with his bags,
he walked to Mahim

401
00:20:40,789 --> 00:20:43,381
Which of these is
brother Gaja's head?

402
00:20:43,756 --> 00:20:45,279
It must be this one

403
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:46,878
No

404
00:20:46,956 --> 00:20:48,013
Has to be this one

405
00:20:48,089 --> 00:20:49,146
No way

406
00:20:49,222 --> 00:20:50,484
It is, I'm sure

407
00:20:50,756 --> 00:20:52,017
How do you know?

408
00:20:52,423 --> 00:20:54,150
He lived next door to me

409
00:20:54,222 --> 00:20:55,484
I know

410
00:20:56,257 --> 00:20:57,983
He got home thirsty

411
00:20:58,056 --> 00:21:02,285
He drank cold water
right out of the bottle

412
00:21:02,356 --> 00:21:03,913
Show it to me

413
00:21:05,823 --> 00:21:06,914
What is this?

414
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:08,955
Is this the brain or the whole head?

415
00:21:09,022 --> 00:21:14,046
He coughed so hard that
it burst a nerve in the brain

416
00:21:17,289 --> 00:21:18,982
Mom

417
00:21:19,056 --> 00:21:21,182
- What?
- Don't sell your products here. please

418
00:21:21,256 --> 00:21:22,416
Of course not
- Please!

419
00:21:24,189 --> 00:21:25,916
He was so proud of you

420
00:21:26,323 --> 00:21:28,755
He would speak of you all the time

421
00:21:30,022 --> 00:21:31,988
You haven't visited us in many years

422
00:21:33,789 --> 00:21:34,880
Aunty Manda...

423
00:21:35,056 --> 00:21:37,250
You must meet everyone,
talk to them

424
00:21:37,323 --> 00:21:38,255
Look, some of them are there

425
00:21:38,323 --> 00:21:40,379
Mom, if you're going to
stay long, I'll carry on

426
00:21:40,455 --> 00:21:41,717
No, I'm coming with you

427
00:21:41,789 --> 00:21:43,119
Drop me at Churchgate

428
00:21:43,189 --> 00:21:44,848
OK. I'm sitting there

429
00:21:46,956 --> 00:21:48,389
Good morning

430
00:21:48,922 --> 00:21:49,911
Raja!

431
00:21:49,989 --> 00:21:51,285
Aunty Indu
- How are you?

432
00:21:51,355 --> 00:21:53,049
Shift

433
00:21:53,122 --> 00:21:55,144
Make some space for me

434
00:21:57,855 --> 00:22:00,083
Raja, how are you?

435
00:22:00,156 --> 00:22:02,383
It has been ages since I saw you

436
00:22:03,022 --> 00:22:04,147
What is the status?

437
00:22:05,822 --> 00:22:08,289
He's on the ventilator.
What could the status be?

438
00:22:08,855 --> 00:22:10,911
I was here this morning

439
00:22:11,155 --> 00:22:13,020
What is the point in
sitting here and crying?

440
00:22:13,622 --> 00:22:16,316
But it's sad this is
happening during Ganpati

441
00:22:16,956 --> 00:22:17,786
Oh my!

442
00:22:18,022 --> 00:22:18,613
What?

443
00:22:19,356 --> 00:22:21,083
In hospital, a sleeveless blouse?

444
00:22:21,156 --> 00:22:23,986
Today is her 25th wedding anniversary

445
00:22:24,056 --> 00:22:26,716
Yes, why eIse would I
dress like this to a hospital?

446
00:22:26,788 --> 00:22:28,016
It's my 25th anniversary

447
00:22:28,088 --> 00:22:28,714
Thank you

448
00:22:28,822 --> 00:22:29,720
Congrats
- Thank you

449
00:22:29,822 --> 00:22:31,186
Congratulations

450
00:22:31,256 --> 00:22:33,813
He has tolerated you for 25 years

451
00:22:33,889 --> 00:22:35,719
Actually, I've tolerated
him all these years

452
00:22:35,822 --> 00:22:36,686
Give me my bag

453
00:22:39,755 --> 00:22:41,347
Don't drop my things

454
00:22:42,222 --> 00:22:44,153
Put your stuff away

455
00:22:44,221 --> 00:22:45,052
Done

456
00:22:45,121 --> 00:22:46,247
Keep it there. Help me out

457
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:47,981
How can I help?

458
00:22:49,622 --> 00:22:52,317
Manda, you must eat now

459
00:22:52,889 --> 00:22:54,218
I don't feel like eating

460
00:22:54,288 --> 00:22:55,982
But you must eat

461
00:22:56,056 --> 00:22:59,044
Starving yourself will
not help Gajanan bhai get better

462
00:22:59,121 --> 00:23:01,247
Have something
- I can't

463
00:23:01,322 --> 00:23:02,221
That is a new product

464
00:23:02,288 --> 00:23:03,221
Yes I thought so

465
00:23:03,789 --> 00:23:04,982
Have a look. It's lovely

466
00:23:07,089 --> 00:23:07,987
Raja...

467
00:23:08,256 --> 00:23:09,982
you're getting a divorce?

468
00:23:10,689 --> 00:23:12,849
Is that why you've lost so much hair?

469
00:23:12,989 --> 00:23:15,148
He's a director, not a hero

470
00:23:15,221 --> 00:23:16,210
Doesn't matter if he loses hair

471
00:23:16,288 --> 00:23:17,254
That's not true

472
00:23:17,322 --> 00:23:19,845
Nowadays,
directors have turned to acting

473
00:23:19,921 --> 00:23:22,854
Our Raja was so good looking

474
00:23:22,989 --> 00:23:25,284
Raja, it's not too late

475
00:23:25,554 --> 00:23:28,578
There are many new oiIs
in the market. Try one

476
00:23:28,655 --> 00:23:30,677
Which oiIs?

477
00:23:30,754 --> 00:23:32,118
They're all adulterated

478
00:23:32,188 --> 00:23:34,211
Hibiscus oil is the best

479
00:23:34,288 --> 00:23:35,981
Yes, that's there.
I'll show you on Google

480
00:23:36,055 --> 00:23:37,782
Enough of your Google

481
00:23:38,555 --> 00:23:40,180
Heat some coconut oil

482
00:23:40,255 --> 00:23:42,312
Add the flowers and bring it to a boil

483
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:45,145
Cool it, and apply at
night before going to bed

484
00:23:45,956 --> 00:23:46,819
Here

485
00:23:47,021 --> 00:23:48,953
These are special containers for oil

486
00:23:49,021 --> 00:23:50,078
Our latest product

487
00:23:50,155 --> 00:23:52,019
Oil doesn't spill out of this one

488
00:23:52,088 --> 00:23:53,179
Here

489
00:23:53,255 --> 00:23:54,221
Raja dada

490
00:23:54,288 --> 00:23:56,311
Prasanna. How are you?

491
00:23:56,588 --> 00:23:57,815
I'm fine. How are you?

492
00:23:57,888 --> 00:23:58,547
I'm fine, too

493
00:23:59,721 --> 00:24:00,119
I'm fine

494
00:24:00,188 --> 00:24:01,177
Will you have some khichdi?

495
00:24:01,255 --> 00:24:02,516
No thanks, not now

496
00:24:02,587 --> 00:24:03,576
Have some butter milk instead
- No

497
00:24:03,654 --> 00:24:04,553
Have some
- No

498
00:24:04,621 --> 00:24:09,111
Raja, Prasanna has him
admitted in such a big hospital

499
00:24:10,555 --> 00:24:12,578
He would never have
been able to afford this

500
00:24:13,121 --> 00:24:15,110
Mother, why do you keep crying?

501
00:24:15,788 --> 00:24:18,050
In 24 hours, he'll improve,
the doctor said

502
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,144
I'm here with you

503
00:24:20,121 --> 00:24:23,088
Come, I want you to meet someone

504
00:24:23,521 --> 00:24:24,214
He's my boss

505
00:24:24,554 --> 00:24:25,816
Yes, of course

506
00:24:26,588 --> 00:24:27,053
We're here

507
00:24:28,689 --> 00:24:29,711
Look at these

508
00:24:31,521 --> 00:24:33,648
Driver, don't drive
on the winding mountain road

509
00:24:33,755 --> 00:24:35,914
I'll take that route,
you take the simpler one

510
00:24:35,988 --> 00:24:37,216
Doesn't matter if you reach later

511
00:24:37,754 --> 00:24:39,686
We can't be late

512
00:24:39,754 --> 00:24:41,243
We want to see him

513
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:44,113
Aunty, you'll get sick

514
00:24:44,188 --> 00:24:45,620
No, I won't
- The road is so winding

515
00:24:45,688 --> 00:24:46,984
Don't worry

516
00:24:47,221 --> 00:24:48,187
You go ahead

517
00:24:48,888 --> 00:24:50,149
We'll take the other route

518
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:51,084
OK

519
00:24:52,088 --> 00:24:53,952
Why is this thing with you?

520
00:24:54,255 --> 00:24:56,949
He wants to go to Pen,
we'll drop him on the way

521
00:24:58,621 --> 00:25:00,587
Mother, why are you going to Mumbai?

522
00:25:00,654 --> 00:25:02,177
Yes, I aIso want to know

523
00:25:02,621 --> 00:25:06,781
Rashmi, instead of you
going to Mumbai, I'll go...

524
00:25:06,854 --> 00:25:08,820
and you look after the house here

525
00:25:09,055 --> 00:25:10,646
They were going to leave me behind...

526
00:25:10,721 --> 00:25:11,948
and you think
they'll take you along?

527
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:13,612
I am not a fool

528
00:25:13,688 --> 00:25:14,552
Aren't you?

529
00:25:14,621 --> 00:25:16,451
- What was that?
- Nothing. Go on

530
00:25:16,521 --> 00:25:18,112
I am going to bring it up

531
00:25:18,955 --> 00:25:20,853
In Mumbai,
what're you going to bring up?

532
00:25:20,921 --> 00:25:22,512
I am going to ask about our toilet

533
00:25:25,688 --> 00:25:27,120
He is so unwell

534
00:25:27,187 --> 00:25:29,882
You can't go to the hospital
and fight for our toilet

535
00:25:29,955 --> 00:25:32,818
Kindly stay out of this matter

536
00:25:33,754 --> 00:25:36,618
All of them take me for a fool

537
00:25:38,753 --> 00:25:40,516
Tell me how many years it's been...

538
00:25:40,587 --> 00:25:42,485
and we still
haven't got our toilet?

539
00:25:42,554 --> 00:25:44,042
We'll get it...

540
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,177
<i>Saru, hurry</i>

541
00:25:45,454 --> 00:25:46,443
Hold on, I'll be there

542
00:25:47,521 --> 00:25:49,112
There's Saru

543
00:25:49,187 --> 00:25:52,484
God knows what she does
in her toilet for hours at a go

544
00:25:52,554 --> 00:25:55,111
She takes an hour,
her son 2 and her husband 3

545
00:25:55,187 --> 00:25:57,847
Who knows what they do while
I am stranded outside...

546
00:25:57,921 --> 00:25:59,613
tumbler in hand

547
00:25:59,687 --> 00:26:00,677
Let Lata come in

548
00:26:00,754 --> 00:26:03,345
I'll tell her I deserve my own toilet

549
00:26:03,421 --> 00:26:05,410
Mother, is Pat coming with her?

550
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:08,410
Yes 'Pat' is coming with his 'cat'...

551
00:26:08,487 --> 00:26:10,419
and the three of you can 'chat'

552
00:26:10,521 --> 00:26:11,351
Yes, tell me

553
00:26:13,054 --> 00:26:14,646
Not so loud, I'm at the hospital

554
00:26:15,753 --> 00:26:16,652
Not me

555
00:26:16,753 --> 00:26:18,948
A party workers' father
is on oxygen here

556
00:26:19,554 --> 00:26:21,350
It's a serious matter

557
00:26:21,653 --> 00:26:22,983
I'll call you later

558
00:26:23,688 --> 00:26:24,677
Bye

559
00:26:25,353 --> 00:26:26,547
Where have you been?

560
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:29,485
I've had a word at the
hospital across the street

561
00:26:29,554 --> 00:26:30,986
Shift your father there

562
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:35,383
Look, our party has donated 4
new ventilators to that hospital

563
00:26:35,688 --> 00:26:37,051
Why do you want to
waste your money here?

564
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:40,016
Prasanna, you can't just shift him

565
00:26:40,487 --> 00:26:42,885
It's a ventilator,
not an oxygen cylinder

566
00:26:42,954 --> 00:26:45,387
If you pull him off it even
for a second, he could die

567
00:26:45,454 --> 00:26:46,851
The hospital is right there

568
00:26:47,887 --> 00:26:50,718
Which Marathi man can't hold
his breath for just 5 minutes?

569
00:26:50,788 --> 00:26:53,481
Raja Kamerkar, my cousin

570
00:26:53,553 --> 00:26:54,644
He is a director

571
00:26:54,787 --> 00:26:55,686
Which company?

572
00:26:55,787 --> 00:26:56,447
In Bollywood

573
00:26:56,521 --> 00:26:57,816
He is a Bollywood director

574
00:26:57,887 --> 00:26:59,580
That's great!

575
00:26:59,687 --> 00:27:01,484
Here, sir

576
00:27:01,554 --> 00:27:02,986
Take a photo

577
00:27:03,054 --> 00:27:07,748
I was wondering where I'd seen you

578
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:09,484
One more

579
00:27:11,954 --> 00:27:14,386
Make sure you decide soon

580
00:27:14,453 --> 00:27:15,476
Let me know

581
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:19,543
No sir, the union here has our men too

582
00:27:19,853 --> 00:27:20,978
They've agreed to help me

583
00:27:21,054 --> 00:27:22,781
They were our men once, not now

584
00:27:23,554 --> 00:27:25,679
Are you going to change
your party for a mere ventilator?

585
00:27:27,687 --> 00:27:30,381
I notice that you take a lot
of decisions...

586
00:27:30,453 --> 00:27:31,783
without consulting me

587
00:27:34,586 --> 00:27:36,814
You take care of your lord,
I'll look after the Lord

588
00:27:36,887 --> 00:27:38,819
Sir, we could go to the altar tomorrow

589
00:27:38,887 --> 00:27:39,943
I'll go with you

590
00:27:40,019 --> 00:27:41,315
I'll go again with you tomorrow

591
00:27:41,787 --> 00:27:44,810
With every visit, I'll garner
more blessings from the Lord

592
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,987
As it is, we commit
so many sins, don't we?

593
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:53,887
If you ever need any help,
you can call me before 10 in the night

594
00:27:54,287 --> 00:27:56,013
Always at your service is...

595
00:27:56,286 --> 00:27:57,810
Kashinath Sudhakar Zantye

596
00:27:58,820 --> 00:27:59,945
Bring him along...

597
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,515
for the Ganpati aarti this year

598
00:28:01,586 --> 00:28:02,814
Come with your family

599
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:04,477
Bye
- Bye sir

600
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,477
Sorry Dada

601
00:28:10,954 --> 00:28:12,716
You know politics is...

602
00:28:12,787 --> 00:28:14,810
I checked upon Uncle Gaju

603
00:28:14,887 --> 00:28:15,944
Doesn't look too good

604
00:28:16,886 --> 00:28:19,216
Prasanna,
I think we should meet the doctor

605
00:28:19,586 --> 00:28:22,245
Dada, you take
Raja dada with you

606
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:26,220
Let him see Baba,
then we'll all go to the doctor

607
00:28:27,585 --> 00:28:28,279
Come

608
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:30,352
I'm here

609
00:28:45,453 --> 00:28:46,351
Tatya

610
00:28:47,253 --> 00:28:48,243
<i>Where' re you going?</i>

611
00:28:49,286 --> 00:28:50,752
What's this?

612
00:28:50,819 --> 00:28:52,286
Tatya, where do you
think you're going?

613
00:28:52,353 --> 00:28:53,251
Mumbai

614
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,218
What for?

615
00:28:54,286 --> 00:28:55,877
I want a ventilator for myself

616
00:28:55,953 --> 00:28:57,477
Why do you need a ventilator?

617
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,208
It's for my voice

618
00:28:59,285 --> 00:29:01,616
How could you believe that fool?

619
00:29:01,886 --> 00:29:03,375
I want to sing during Ganpati

620
00:29:03,453 --> 00:29:05,646
Fine! Go sit in the back

621
00:29:05,786 --> 00:29:08,151
No. I will sit in the front

622
00:29:08,219 --> 00:29:08,742
Why?

623
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:11,751
Sitting in the back
makes me want to pee

624
00:29:11,819 --> 00:29:14,445
Why don't you do all that
before getting out of the house?

625
00:29:14,553 --> 00:29:16,178
I am going to sit right here

626
00:29:16,253 --> 00:29:18,151
OK, wear the seat belt
- No

627
00:29:18,219 --> 00:29:19,652
- You won't wear the seat belt?
- No

628
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:23,209
How can you not wear the seat belt!

629
00:29:28,586 --> 00:29:31,415
Yes Ajit, how are you?

630
00:29:31,485 --> 00:29:33,179
Has everyone left?

631
00:29:33,253 --> 00:29:34,185
You're coming there, aren't you?

632
00:29:34,253 --> 00:29:35,777
Where? Where is everyone going?

633
00:29:35,853 --> 00:29:37,841
To see Gaju bhau.
Didn't they tell you?

634
00:29:38,286 --> 00:29:41,253
It was decided not to tell anyone

635
00:29:41,386 --> 00:29:42,579
So I was pretending not to know

636
00:29:42,752 --> 00:29:44,150
Anyway, I'm going there

637
00:29:44,219 --> 00:29:45,844
They wanted to leave me behind

638
00:29:46,186 --> 00:29:48,550
It's so sad that this
has happened to Uncle Gaju

639
00:29:49,552 --> 00:29:52,382
I don't think we can
celebrate Ganpati this year

640
00:29:52,719 --> 00:29:55,345
That means I can't
celebrate Hartalika either

641
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:57,818
I say you must come here.
We'll protest

642
00:29:57,886 --> 00:29:59,148
We'll discuss everything

643
00:29:59,218 --> 00:30:02,708
What was that? We'll do what?

644
00:30:02,786 --> 00:30:04,149
What did you say?

645
00:30:04,218 --> 00:30:05,310
We'll discuss everything

646
00:30:05,385 --> 00:30:08,682
How can we dig up these
matters when he is so unwell?

647
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:14,681
I am going to bring up my mangoes,
and you must bring up your toilet

648
00:30:16,919 --> 00:30:18,646
I can't hear you properly, speak up

649
00:30:18,752 --> 00:30:20,309
Poor network

650
00:30:20,385 --> 00:30:22,318
I can't hear you properly, speak up

651
00:30:22,386 --> 00:30:22,874
Come again

652
00:30:23,153 --> 00:30:26,779
I am going to bring up my mangoes,
and you must bring up your toilet

653
00:30:28,585 --> 00:30:29,415
Heard that?

654
00:30:29,485 --> 00:30:30,246
Sorry, what?

655
00:30:30,319 --> 00:30:32,615
Never mind. Yes, got that

656
00:30:33,619 --> 00:30:34,347
OK

657
00:30:35,585 --> 00:30:36,745
Will you stop it?

658
00:30:37,285 --> 00:30:38,809
One kurta is enough

659
00:30:39,686 --> 00:30:41,914
No. That's it

660
00:30:42,619 --> 00:30:43,346
Come on, hurry up

661
00:30:43,419 --> 00:30:44,250
What is it?

662
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,183
Just wait for a while

663
00:30:48,852 --> 00:30:50,409
Bye. See you

664
00:30:57,652 --> 00:30:58,675
Wait for me

665
00:30:58,752 --> 00:31:00,185
Let's leave

666
00:31:00,253 --> 00:31:03,480
Hail Lord Ganesha!

667
00:31:03,552 --> 00:31:05,110
Is this a pilgrimage?

668
00:31:06,452 --> 00:31:07,350
Go back home

669
00:31:14,819 --> 00:31:16,376
Hi sir
- Hello

670
00:31:17,385 --> 00:31:18,317
Yes Vinya?

671
00:31:19,786 --> 00:31:21,183
Are the idoIs ready?

672
00:31:21,252 --> 00:31:22,809
Yes, almost done

673
00:31:23,085 --> 00:31:24,347
But what is this I hear?

674
00:31:24,419 --> 00:31:25,283
What's the matter?

675
00:31:25,352 --> 00:31:26,580
What happened?

676
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:28,414
What is Bhiku saying?

677
00:31:28,484 --> 00:31:30,247
Gajanan Kamerkar is about to pop it

678
00:31:30,319 --> 00:31:32,785
Ventis, he is on a ventis

679
00:31:34,785 --> 00:31:35,581
Ventilator!

680
00:31:35,686 --> 00:31:36,709
Yes, I know

681
00:31:36,786 --> 00:31:38,808
Who is on the ventilator?

682
00:31:39,085 --> 00:31:40,108
I'll tell you later

683
00:31:40,185 --> 00:31:41,618
Yes, he is on the ventilator

684
00:31:41,719 --> 00:31:43,344
So he is as good as gone

685
00:31:43,418 --> 00:31:46,351
These Kamerkars are at it again

686
00:31:46,419 --> 00:31:49,441
Every year one of them drops dead

687
00:31:49,751 --> 00:31:50,512
Hello Dada

688
00:31:50,584 --> 00:31:51,676
Hello
- Hello

689
00:31:52,085 --> 00:31:53,643
Such a large family

690
00:31:53,719 --> 00:31:56,481
They have never heard
of family planning

691
00:31:56,552 --> 00:31:57,347
Be quiet

692
00:31:57,419 --> 00:32:02,147
A single fellow came to the village
and now they have their own tribe here

693
00:32:02,252 --> 00:32:09,083
They have 15 uncles,
17 aunts and 20 grandchildren

694
00:32:09,152 --> 00:32:11,084
Will you turn it down a bit?

695
00:32:11,152 --> 00:32:13,777
I can't hear him
and you're bellowing on

696
00:32:14,052 --> 00:32:15,677
I can't speak about my own business?

697
00:32:15,751 --> 00:32:16,740
I'm handling it

698
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:18,314
Which is why I have to speak up

699
00:32:18,385 --> 00:32:20,078
You'll teach your father?

700
00:32:20,185 --> 00:32:22,208
Hello? Dada?

701
00:32:22,618 --> 00:32:24,142
Sorry, the call dropped

702
00:32:24,751 --> 00:32:26,683
Your family needs 5 idoIs

703
00:32:27,018 --> 00:32:29,609
They are all ready,
except for the eyes

704
00:32:30,118 --> 00:32:33,516
If you go into mourning,
what will I do with those 5 idoIs?

705
00:32:33,718 --> 00:32:35,014
You're right

706
00:32:35,319 --> 00:32:37,011
They never pay any amount in advance

707
00:32:37,351 --> 00:32:40,716
They just book the
idoIs at the old rates

708
00:32:40,785 --> 00:32:43,717
Just give them an old idol

709
00:32:44,518 --> 00:32:46,611
Vinya, get your father some tea

710
00:32:46,686 --> 00:32:48,651
We have just reached the hospital

711
00:32:48,718 --> 00:32:51,583
OK. But please take the idoIs home

712
00:32:51,651 --> 00:32:53,117
Vinya, I'll let you know

713
00:32:53,184 --> 00:32:54,344
You continue working on our idoIs

714
00:32:54,785 --> 00:32:56,649
OK
- I'll wait for your call

715
00:32:57,750 --> 00:32:58,615
Your pass?

716
00:32:59,117 --> 00:33:00,084
Prasanna Kamerkar

717
00:33:02,485 --> 00:33:04,974
The management makes the rules,
the union breaks them

718
00:33:05,052 --> 00:33:06,984
We are graduates reduced
to pressing buttons

719
00:33:09,418 --> 00:33:11,942
- Sir, did you consider it?
- I told you I don't want your service

720
00:33:16,618 --> 00:33:17,709
RK?

721
00:33:19,151 --> 00:33:20,242
Nice to meet you, sir

722
00:33:20,318 --> 00:33:21,079
How are you?

723
00:33:22,118 --> 00:33:23,606
My uncle is being operated upon

724
00:33:25,318 --> 00:33:26,216
What is wrong with him?

725
00:33:26,284 --> 00:33:27,216
Piles

726
00:33:27,284 --> 00:33:28,512
He is being operated upon for piles

727
00:33:29,285 --> 00:33:31,011
Will you come say hello to him?

728
00:33:31,351 --> 00:33:32,181
Not now

729
00:33:32,251 --> 00:33:33,649
My uncle is in the ICU

730
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:34,679
Please come

731
00:33:35,184 --> 00:33:36,582
Not now, later

732
00:33:36,651 --> 00:33:38,947
But make sure you enter with me

733
00:33:39,018 --> 00:33:41,382
My uncle must know
it was I who got you to him

734
00:33:42,284 --> 00:33:43,944
Sure

735
00:33:47,685 --> 00:33:50,549
Mr. RK, I'm waiting
for you on the 5th floor

736
00:33:51,984 --> 00:33:53,075
That's your father

737
00:33:53,151 --> 00:33:54,481
You go ahead, I'll speak to him

738
00:33:55,518 --> 00:33:56,382
Yes Bhau?

739
00:33:56,617 --> 00:33:57,413
Tell me

740
00:33:58,318 --> 00:34:00,148
Don't chatter away in there

741
00:34:00,351 --> 00:34:01,475
Be silent

742
00:34:01,984 --> 00:34:03,382
Raja, when did you arrive?

743
00:34:03,451 --> 00:34:04,383
Namaste

744
00:34:05,618 --> 00:34:07,050
Back off

745
00:34:07,117 --> 00:34:08,242
He must be tired

746
00:34:08,551 --> 00:34:09,983
How are you?

747
00:34:10,051 --> 00:34:13,245
You look so different

748
00:34:14,051 --> 00:34:16,484
I'm glad you came here to see Baba

749
00:34:16,551 --> 00:34:18,278
Did you find a parking
spot for your car?

750
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:19,449
Do you want some water?

751
00:34:19,518 --> 00:34:21,280
I have some boiled water with me

752
00:34:21,351 --> 00:34:23,181
- You don't have to drink...
- Sarika

753
00:34:23,417 --> 00:34:24,407
How is your father?

754
00:34:25,017 --> 00:34:26,108
How are you?

755
00:34:27,884 --> 00:34:29,044
I am fine

756
00:34:29,384 --> 00:34:30,475
Baba is fine

757
00:34:31,418 --> 00:34:33,247
He will be so happy to see you

758
00:34:34,051 --> 00:34:35,381
What is the day today?

759
00:34:35,518 --> 00:34:36,382
Monday

760
00:34:36,451 --> 00:34:37,144
Right

761
00:34:37,217 --> 00:34:38,307
So it is Tuesday tomorrow

762
00:34:38,383 --> 00:34:40,475
That is Ganpati's day

763
00:34:40,617 --> 00:34:44,413
You know Baba is a
true Ganpati devotee

764
00:34:44,483 --> 00:34:46,280
He won't take him away from us

765
00:34:48,951 --> 00:34:51,645
During the Shravan month,
only Gajanan had to fast...

766
00:34:51,917 --> 00:34:53,247
since he would perform
the prayer ritual

767
00:34:53,451 --> 00:34:56,542
And the others would party all night

768
00:34:57,451 --> 00:35:00,508
Why are we chatting here?
Go. Go meet Baba

769
00:35:00,583 --> 00:35:05,880
Once Baba wakes up tomorrow,
we are all going to the village

770
00:35:05,951 --> 00:35:07,815
OK

771
00:35:07,884 --> 00:35:10,010
He has that bus for the shooting

772
00:35:10,084 --> 00:35:12,141
The one with the toilet and a bed?

773
00:35:12,217 --> 00:35:14,206
We can take Uncle Gajanan in that bus

774
00:35:14,284 --> 00:35:15,114
We can?

775
00:35:15,184 --> 00:35:16,877
I hope you don't mind

776
00:35:16,951 --> 00:35:18,508
We'll talk about it later

777
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:19,516
You go meet him now

778
00:35:19,817 --> 00:35:20,579
Wait a moment

779
00:35:21,450 --> 00:35:25,543
Will you please place
this on the ventilator?

780
00:35:25,817 --> 00:35:27,476
Yes
- Don't open it here

781
00:35:28,017 --> 00:35:29,313
Go in there and open it

782
00:35:29,383 --> 00:35:30,316
Make way for him

783
00:35:30,384 --> 00:35:32,372
Let him go in first

784
00:35:33,216 --> 00:35:35,309
Once Raja sees him,
we'll decide what to do

785
00:35:35,384 --> 00:35:36,248
Hello sir

786
00:35:36,518 --> 00:35:37,415
- How are you, sir?
- Fine

787
00:35:37,583 --> 00:35:38,811
Sir, one selfie please?

788
00:35:38,951 --> 00:35:40,417
- Later, maybe?
- Sure, sir

789
00:37:17,216 --> 00:37:18,306
What's going on?

790
00:37:18,783 --> 00:37:19,874
This is an ICU

791
00:37:20,283 --> 00:37:21,272
Sorry

792
00:37:22,417 --> 00:37:23,246
Sorry

793
00:37:23,316 --> 00:37:24,215
Hello

794
00:37:44,883 --> 00:37:46,008
Did you get it?

795
00:37:46,083 --> 00:37:47,776
She put the Ganpati
on top of the ventilator

796
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:49,274
Got it

797
00:38:01,282 --> 00:38:03,715
- Didn't you recognize me?
- No

798
00:38:04,883 --> 00:38:07,315
I am Rucha, Sarika's daughter

799
00:38:08,216 --> 00:38:09,341
Hi

800
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:12,343
What were you checking in there?

801
00:38:12,616 --> 00:38:14,946
I am studying medicine

802
00:38:15,016 --> 00:38:15,810
I see

803
00:38:16,749 --> 00:38:18,112
So what did you see on the monitor?

804
00:38:18,182 --> 00:38:19,376
I am in my second year of study

805
00:38:19,649 --> 00:38:21,672
We haven't been taught
about the ventilator yet

806
00:38:21,882 --> 00:38:23,975
I read everything on the internet

807
00:38:25,649 --> 00:38:26,615
Let's go out

808
00:38:26,682 --> 00:38:28,342
All his organs are fine

809
00:38:28,616 --> 00:38:32,242
But the one that controIs all of them,
the small brain, is not functioning

810
00:38:32,316 --> 00:38:33,908
Apart from that, he is fine

811
00:38:34,249 --> 00:38:35,716
He will recover

812
00:38:35,783 --> 00:38:37,306
She speaks like an expert,
doesn't she?

813
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:39,077
She is studying medicine

814
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:41,278
So, what's your take?

815
00:38:46,116 --> 00:38:47,276
He's fine, but...

816
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:49,940
Exactly! I knew it. He is fine

817
00:38:56,282 --> 00:38:57,646
This is an ICU

818
00:38:57,749 --> 00:38:59,680
How many of you are here at a time?

819
00:38:59,748 --> 00:39:01,772
It's 11.30.
The visiting hours are over

820
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:03,913
I know you have clout in the hospital

821
00:39:03,982 --> 00:39:05,005
OK

822
00:39:05,115 --> 00:39:09,070
You know, sir,
the senior doctor will take us to task

823
00:39:09,682 --> 00:39:10,773
So, please...

824
00:39:11,149 --> 00:39:12,138
OK
- Yes, sorry

825
00:39:12,215 --> 00:39:13,841
Let's go downstairs

826
00:39:15,316 --> 00:39:17,180
Wait, let's ask her

827
00:39:17,716 --> 00:39:19,841
A patient on the ventilator
does get better, right?

828
00:39:19,915 --> 00:39:21,143
I mean he comes back, doesn't he?

829
00:39:22,616 --> 00:39:23,582
Tell him

830
00:39:24,848 --> 00:39:25,678
Look...

831
00:39:26,581 --> 00:39:27,070
yes, it happens

832
00:39:27,683 --> 00:39:28,615
See?

833
00:39:28,683 --> 00:39:31,842
But doctors have their own limitations

834
00:39:32,049 --> 00:39:34,243
Above everyone is God

835
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:39,744
Next to your father is a lady

836
00:39:39,816 --> 00:39:41,781
Her case is similar to your fathers

837
00:39:41,848 --> 00:39:44,076
The family was persistent

838
00:39:44,616 --> 00:39:47,638
Said they had one mother
so they would wait

839
00:39:48,015 --> 00:39:49,209
There's a temple downstairs

840
00:39:49,716 --> 00:39:54,841
They arranged for a prayer ritual

841
00:39:55,215 --> 00:39:56,681
And you know what?

842
00:39:56,748 --> 00:40:00,010
Within seven days, her finger...

843
00:40:01,748 --> 00:40:02,305
moved

844
00:40:03,949 --> 00:40:04,847
See?

845
00:40:05,882 --> 00:40:08,712
So how is she now?

846
00:40:10,615 --> 00:40:11,945
This is the second week

847
00:40:12,015 --> 00:40:14,209
The family is waiting for...

848
00:40:14,281 --> 00:40:18,009
the second finger to move

849
00:40:19,715 --> 00:40:20,977
Thank you

850
00:40:21,049 --> 00:40:23,140
Rucha, you stay here with Grandpa

851
00:40:23,214 --> 00:40:27,148
The moment you see his finger move,
let me know

852
00:40:27,282 --> 00:40:28,679
Bye
- Let's go

853
00:40:28,748 --> 00:40:30,044
You sit in the lobby,
I'll be right behind you

854
00:40:30,115 --> 00:40:32,706
Sarika
- Raja, you stay here

855
00:40:32,782 --> 00:40:34,111
I'll meet the nurse and come back

856
00:40:34,181 --> 00:40:35,306
I want to know more from her

857
00:40:36,615 --> 00:40:37,275
Raja

858
00:40:39,014 --> 00:40:40,538
Unbelievable!

859
00:40:41,281 --> 00:40:43,873
It has been years
since you last met them

860
00:40:44,782 --> 00:40:45,873
Let's go to the lobby

861
00:40:46,081 --> 00:40:47,741
There are several characters there

862
00:40:52,581 --> 00:40:54,548
Pay attention to what I say

863
00:40:57,181 --> 00:40:59,977
Uncle Shirish

864
00:41:01,248 --> 00:41:02,476
How are you?

865
00:41:02,882 --> 00:41:05,473
This is a hospital,
not a wedding party

866
00:41:05,548 --> 00:41:07,708
You better not talk of weddings

867
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:10,973
You haven't found a single
suitable girl for me...

868
00:41:11,181 --> 00:41:13,011
even as you find
a match for everyone eIse

869
00:41:13,081 --> 00:41:15,480
Tell me what the situation is like

870
00:41:15,548 --> 00:41:17,071
We can't decide on anything

871
00:41:17,148 --> 00:41:18,706
The family elders
will take the decision

872
00:41:18,882 --> 00:41:21,643
But Prasanna is doing his duty

873
00:41:21,881 --> 00:41:23,871
Karan, how are you?

874
00:41:26,082 --> 00:41:27,206
Who is that cute fellow?

875
00:41:27,481 --> 00:41:29,174
- I hope I'm not disturbing you?
- No

876
00:41:29,515 --> 00:41:31,209
He is Aunty Indu's son, Karan

877
00:41:31,481 --> 00:41:33,038
An I I NI-Bangalore graduate

878
00:41:33,114 --> 00:41:34,080
Carry on

879
00:41:34,715 --> 00:41:37,045
He is a tad too educated

880
00:41:37,881 --> 00:41:40,473
Uncle, he is the perfect
candidate for you

881
00:41:41,248 --> 00:41:41,908
Very good

882
00:41:41,982 --> 00:41:43,505
I'll get there later

883
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:45,013
Where is Manda?

884
00:41:48,081 --> 00:41:49,172
Behave yourself

885
00:42:01,748 --> 00:42:03,941
Which clan are you from?

886
00:42:04,014 --> 00:42:04,946
Bharadwaj

887
00:42:05,515 --> 00:42:07,845
You'll definitely be in mourning

888
00:42:15,747 --> 00:42:16,736
Tell me...

889
00:42:16,981 --> 00:42:18,505
where are you from?

890
00:42:18,949 --> 00:42:22,074
We are the Kamerkars of Ratnagiri

891
00:42:22,448 --> 00:42:23,710
But these are local Kamerkars

892
00:42:24,048 --> 00:42:25,639
<i>The party workers
wanted to know, not me</i>

893
00:42:25,714 --> 00:42:28,647
If someone in the family dies...

894
00:42:28,881 --> 00:42:30,847
how can I avoid mourning?

895
00:42:30,914 --> 00:42:32,539
Can I change my clan?

896
00:42:33,014 --> 00:42:34,538
That is impossible

897
00:42:34,715 --> 00:42:36,510
You can't change your clan

898
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:37,740
Please tell them

899
00:42:37,847 --> 00:42:39,610
You should pray to the Goddess

900
00:42:40,014 --> 00:42:42,140
<i>Sing hymns non-stop</i>

901
00:42:42,514 --> 00:42:44,538
The Goddess will be happy

902
00:42:44,847 --> 00:42:47,176
If the Goddess is happy,
Gajanan will be saved

903
00:42:47,447 --> 00:42:48,845
All problems solved

904
00:42:49,614 --> 00:42:52,171
Consider my situation:
If Gajanan dies...

905
00:42:52,447 --> 00:42:52,936
Hey!

906
00:42:53,014 --> 00:42:55,071
Assuming, just assuming

907
00:42:55,148 --> 00:42:58,637
Assuming Gajanan dies,
I lose out on 5 prayer rituaIs

908
00:42:58,714 --> 00:43:01,340
5 times 500/- is 2500/-

909
00:43:01,415 --> 00:43:02,710
Another 500/- for the...

910
00:43:02,814 --> 00:43:03,837
You're sure the Goddess will bless us?

911
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:05,381
Yes, of course

912
00:43:06,648 --> 00:43:08,579
Let's go to the temple
- Yes

913
00:43:09,514 --> 00:43:10,503
He can't help us

914
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:11,513
He is of no use to us

915
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:12,445
Let's go

916
00:43:13,514 --> 00:43:14,344
Come on

917
00:43:14,948 --> 00:43:15,971
What about my fee?

918
00:43:16,048 --> 00:43:17,774
You'll get it next year

919
00:43:18,714 --> 00:43:19,908
Kanchan sir

920
00:43:26,714 --> 00:43:27,680
Yes, Jai?

921
00:43:28,447 --> 00:43:29,413
Why didn't you call me?

922
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:30,378
Have you reached the interval?

923
00:43:30,447 --> 00:43:31,880
Yes sir, a while ago

924
00:43:31,981 --> 00:43:33,345
She went for lunch

925
00:43:33,415 --> 00:43:34,471
She's not back yet

926
00:43:34,547 --> 00:43:35,741
Any...?

927
00:43:35,881 --> 00:43:37,506
She didn't say anything

928
00:43:37,714 --> 00:43:38,680
You are late

929
00:43:38,747 --> 00:43:39,940
Be practical

930
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:41,410
Who eIse is here?

931
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:42,072
Everyone

932
00:43:42,347 --> 00:43:45,473
Prasanna,
why are Subhash and Ravi here?

933
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:48,639
There was to be a meeting about...

934
00:43:48,714 --> 00:43:51,112
our village house and land

935
00:43:52,013 --> 00:43:54,742
Baba was going to waive
his rights without consulting me

936
00:43:56,047 --> 00:43:57,810
All of them will obviously
want to be here now

937
00:43:59,647 --> 00:44:01,579
What do you think of the hospital,
Raja dada?

938
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:02,804
Very nice

939
00:44:03,013 --> 00:44:03,946
State-of-the-an

940
00:44:04,948 --> 00:44:07,471
Tell me, what did the doctor say?

941
00:44:07,781 --> 00:44:11,508
Not much. They said he
should improve in 24 hours

942
00:44:11,579 --> 00:44:15,877
Did you ask them about the future
of a patient with a brain haemorrhage?

943
00:44:15,948 --> 00:44:18,914
Prasanna, it's a very tricky situation

944
00:44:19,314 --> 00:44:20,712
And costs a lot of money

945
00:44:21,048 --> 00:44:21,672
Money...

946
00:44:21,746 --> 00:44:24,008
If the patient doesn't
respond to the treatment, then...

947
00:44:24,314 --> 00:44:26,939
to keep him on the
ventilator or not...

948
00:44:27,013 --> 00:44:28,638
is a very confusing decision

949
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:31,372
That will be the
most critical decision

950
00:44:32,279 --> 00:44:35,645
Before putting him on the ventilator,
what the doctor said to you...

951
00:44:35,714 --> 00:44:36,737
is what we need to know

952
00:44:38,013 --> 00:44:39,706
I'll just finish
something and come back

953
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:42,575
Let's discuss this once I'm back

954
00:44:43,379 --> 00:44:44,675
Make yourself comfortable

955
00:44:47,913 --> 00:44:49,277
Look at him

956
00:44:49,479 --> 00:44:51,469
Neck-deep in his politics

957
00:44:52,914 --> 00:44:56,608
Uncle Gaju is a simple man.
He couldn't stop Prasanna

958
00:44:57,447 --> 00:45:01,243
He would fight at home and Uncle
Gaju would call me to convince him

959
00:45:01,846 --> 00:45:04,210
Uncle Gaju was very
disappointed in him

960
00:45:05,346 --> 00:45:08,473
Prasanna never spoke to him politely

961
00:45:11,546 --> 00:45:12,671
He has certainly changed

962
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:15,207
Let him come back

963
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:16,544
We'll talk to him

964
00:45:32,613 --> 00:45:33,670
Hello

965
00:45:34,547 --> 00:45:35,308
Yes?

966
00:45:35,846 --> 00:45:38,676
You are Indu's son?

967
00:45:40,447 --> 00:45:41,708
Correct?
What is your name?

968
00:45:42,546 --> 00:45:43,774
Karan
- Karan

969
00:45:43,846 --> 00:45:44,937
I remember meeting
you when you were a child

970
00:45:45,213 --> 00:45:47,508
You were so small when I last saw you

971
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:49,306
It's good to see you again

972
00:45:49,379 --> 00:45:51,539
lam Shirish Khatu

973
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:54,539
Namaste. Pleasure

974
00:45:54,846 --> 00:45:55,869
You carry on with your work

975
00:45:55,947 --> 00:45:56,969
Don't let me disturb you

976
00:45:57,746 --> 00:46:01,270
I wanted to know, what your
expectations are, basically?

977
00:46:01,347 --> 00:46:02,278
Sorry?

978
00:46:02,779 --> 00:46:06,236
About girIs. I mean, for marriage

979
00:46:08,579 --> 00:46:12,342
You will marry a girl, won't you?
I hope there's no other problem

980
00:46:12,579 --> 00:46:13,874
You're not into...

981
00:46:15,212 --> 00:46:16,406
No, not at all

982
00:46:16,479 --> 00:46:18,275
I'm extremely sorry,
but I need to focus right now

983
00:46:18,346 --> 00:46:20,335
Please don't let me disturb you

984
00:46:20,413 --> 00:46:21,379
Carry on with your work

985
00:46:21,446 --> 00:46:24,810
Why don't you give me your number?

986
00:46:27,513 --> 00:46:29,808
Actually, let me give you my number

987
00:46:38,479 --> 00:46:39,603
OK

988
00:46:41,179 --> 00:46:44,339
I've given you my number,
so call me please

989
00:46:46,246 --> 00:46:46,905
OK, I will

990
00:46:47,179 --> 00:46:48,373
Please. Thank you

991
00:46:53,813 --> 00:46:54,711
Got it

992
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:57,303
You carry on with your work.
Don't let me disturb you

993
00:46:57,479 --> 00:46:58,309
Good

994
00:47:11,445 --> 00:47:12,412
You can see it later

995
00:47:12,478 --> 00:47:13,468
No worries

996
00:47:13,613 --> 00:47:15,409
Sure. Thank you
- Do remember

997
00:47:15,479 --> 00:47:17,241
Thank you so much

998
00:47:17,313 --> 00:47:18,438
Nice to meet you, Uncle

999
00:47:18,513 --> 00:47:19,479
Take care

1000
00:47:19,546 --> 00:47:21,103
Thank you

1001
00:48:14,579 --> 00:48:17,442
Ashwin, can you please
meet the doctor?

1002
00:48:17,512 --> 00:48:19,001
I am going to

1003
00:48:19,079 --> 00:48:20,408
But Prasanna needs to be there with me

1004
00:48:21,645 --> 00:48:23,634
Both of them had a
fight last night as well

1005
00:48:23,745 --> 00:48:25,041
As usual

1006
00:48:25,112 --> 00:48:27,100
He asked Prasanna to come
with us to the village, for Ganpati

1007
00:48:27,445 --> 00:48:28,639
Expectedly, Prasanna didn't want to

1008
00:48:28,745 --> 00:48:30,041
He refused flat out

1009
00:48:30,112 --> 00:48:31,441
Obviously, his father was furious

1010
00:48:32,211 --> 00:48:33,769
He never tried to understand
what his son really wanted

1011
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:35,239
Aunty, you sit here

1012
00:48:36,045 --> 00:48:38,512
Prasanna is too tied up at work

1013
00:48:38,712 --> 00:48:40,076
Why don't you sit down?

1014
00:48:40,146 --> 00:48:42,077
I can never take sides in their fights

1015
00:48:42,145 --> 00:48:43,111
Don't worry, we'll sort it out

1016
00:48:43,178 --> 00:48:44,702
Sit here

1017
00:48:44,779 --> 00:48:46,710
- Doctor?
- I'll take care of it

1018
00:48:49,745 --> 00:48:51,007
He is looking into it

1019
00:48:51,079 --> 00:48:52,408
Sai, are you sure about him?

1020
00:48:52,478 --> 00:48:53,205
Say Yes and...

1021
00:48:53,278 --> 00:48:55,244
he'll get it done
before Zantye arrives

1022
00:48:55,312 --> 00:48:56,472
- Won't you?
- Yes sir

1023
00:48:57,078 --> 00:49:00,136
Look at these diamonds.
They are well within your budget

1024
00:49:00,211 --> 00:49:02,304
I never do a shabby job, sir

1025
00:49:02,378 --> 00:49:07,708
God Himself will approve of
what I've done with these

1026
00:49:07,978 --> 00:49:09,240
Pack him off

1027
00:49:09,679 --> 00:49:11,668
Sir, listen to me, please

1028
00:49:11,946 --> 00:49:13,434
Gajanan Kamerkar, right?

1029
00:49:13,512 --> 00:49:14,444
He is under Dr. Shroff

1030
00:49:14,512 --> 00:49:15,478
Thanks

1031
00:49:15,545 --> 00:49:16,943
Hi Doc
- You're welcome

1032
00:49:17,578 --> 00:49:19,305
It's Dr. Shroff. You were right

1033
00:49:19,378 --> 00:49:22,004
He's the best.
Let me know if you need anything

1034
00:49:22,078 --> 00:49:23,204
See you, Doc

1035
00:49:25,278 --> 00:49:27,370
I'm sure you want to
see Dr. Shroff now

1036
00:49:27,445 --> 00:49:29,536
How sweet of you! Yes, thank you

1037
00:49:29,611 --> 00:49:31,203
<i>He's in surgery just now</i>

1038
00:49:31,278 --> 00:49:32,369
It's a brain surgery

1039
00:49:32,445 --> 00:49:34,672
Sometimes, it takes <i>6</i> to 7 hours

1040
00:49:35,611 --> 00:49:36,578
You'll have to wait a while

1041
00:49:38,145 --> 00:49:39,373
Are you leaving?

1042
00:49:39,444 --> 00:49:41,172
Sorry to disturb you

1043
00:49:41,245 --> 00:49:42,439
When can we see the doctor?

1044
00:49:43,345 --> 00:49:45,277
Uncle, wait a moment

1045
00:49:46,577 --> 00:49:47,703
Let me do one thing

1046
00:49:48,278 --> 00:49:49,301
I'll wait

1047
00:49:49,612 --> 00:49:51,100
The doctor can get free any time

1048
00:49:51,577 --> 00:49:52,442
I guess I'll wait

1049
00:50:08,011 --> 00:50:09,375
Where are we, Pritam? Are we there?

1050
00:50:09,445 --> 00:50:10,639
Of course not. Go back to sleep

1051
00:50:14,278 --> 00:50:17,141
Hey you.
I told you to take the lower road

1052
00:50:17,611 --> 00:50:19,305
Why are you following
me on this hilly road?

1053
00:50:20,578 --> 00:50:23,475
Aaswad Hotel is not on that route

1054
00:50:23,945 --> 00:50:24,968
Where would we have eaten?

1055
00:50:25,045 --> 00:50:26,239
You' re absolutely right

1056
00:50:26,512 --> 00:50:27,944
The hotel is on the wrong route

1057
00:50:30,178 --> 00:50:31,406
Tatya!

1058
00:50:39,177 --> 00:50:40,371
Tatya!

1059
00:50:43,678 --> 00:50:46,077
- Why have we stopped?
- Look for yourself

1060
00:50:46,412 --> 00:50:49,173
- Tatya!
- Pritam, we want to go as well

1061
00:50:49,244 --> 00:50:50,972
Do you?
What can I do!

1062
00:50:51,045 --> 00:50:52,273
Stay there. No more changing cars

1063
00:50:52,577 --> 00:50:53,601
Tatya

1064
00:50:54,477 --> 00:50:56,534
It's so easy for men

1065
00:50:57,011 --> 00:50:58,976
They can relieve themselves
wherever they want

1066
00:50:59,044 --> 00:51:00,875
We women are stuck, aren't we?

1067
00:51:00,945 --> 00:51:02,173
You said it

1068
00:51:02,345 --> 00:51:03,402
Cover up

1069
00:51:03,478 --> 00:51:05,307
If people see you, what will they say!

1070
00:51:07,577 --> 00:51:08,442
Hurry UP

1071
00:51:24,211 --> 00:51:25,006
Yes, Jai?

1072
00:51:25,312 --> 00:51:26,175
Video chat?

1073
00:51:27,010 --> 00:51:27,533
All well?

1074
00:51:27,611 --> 00:51:31,237
Sir, she just left.
Without a word

1075
00:51:33,044 --> 00:51:33,567
Sorry sir

1076
00:51:33,644 --> 00:51:35,042
Jai, you're such a bad actor!

1077
00:51:35,111 --> 00:51:36,372
Move. Give it to me

1078
00:51:36,544 --> 00:51:38,135
Thank God you're only in direction

1079
00:51:38,277 --> 00:51:39,971
I'm so sorry RK,
but I just wanted to call you...

1080
00:51:40,045 --> 00:51:42,204
and tell you
my immediate reaction

1081
00:51:42,444 --> 00:51:43,308
It is such a lovely film!

1082
00:51:44,644 --> 00:51:48,099
You know, it doesn't drag at all,
all the characters are well-written

1083
00:51:48,177 --> 00:51:50,109
Gosh, that's Priyanka!

1084
00:51:50,177 --> 00:51:52,973
And I'm awesome in the movie!

1085
00:51:53,210 --> 00:51:54,574
You're fabulous, not great

1086
00:51:55,311 --> 00:51:56,869
No no, it was a team effort

1087
00:51:56,945 --> 00:52:00,502
I really...
I just wanted to say thank you

1088
00:52:02,111 --> 00:52:02,803
Hello

1089
00:52:02,977 --> 00:52:04,068
Hi

1090
00:52:05,944 --> 00:52:07,036
My relatives

1091
00:52:08,044 --> 00:52:09,135
Nice to meet you

1092
00:52:09,210 --> 00:52:10,108
Ravi

1093
00:52:10,177 --> 00:52:11,041
Aunty Usha

1094
00:52:11,110 --> 00:52:12,133
Asha. Our anniversary...

1095
00:52:12,210 --> 00:52:13,266
Indu. Hi

1096
00:52:13,510 --> 00:52:15,341
Sai, his brother

1097
00:52:15,411 --> 00:52:17,070
It's a pleasure meeting all of you

1098
00:52:17,144 --> 00:52:19,201
You... you... you...

1099
00:52:19,543 --> 00:52:20,408
all of you

1100
00:52:23,810 --> 00:52:24,935
Is everything alright there?

1101
00:52:25,077 --> 00:52:26,339
It's fine

1102
00:52:27,544 --> 00:52:29,407
We are waiting to meet the doctor

1103
00:52:29,576 --> 00:52:31,566
After that, we'll arrive on a decision

1104
00:52:32,044 --> 00:52:33,272
That's a very tough decision

1105
00:52:34,177 --> 00:52:37,508
I'll pray for your uncle's
speedy recovery

1106
00:52:37,877 --> 00:52:38,400
Thanks

1107
00:52:39,110 --> 00:52:40,200
Take care. Good luck

1108
00:52:40,276 --> 00:52:41,072
Bye

1109
00:52:41,144 --> 00:52:42,508
See you

1110
00:52:45,109 --> 00:52:48,133
Raja, when can we see your film?

1111
00:52:48,210 --> 00:52:49,574
You must organize a
special screening for us

1112
00:52:50,510 --> 00:52:51,908
Yes, of course

1113
00:52:51,977 --> 00:52:53,569
Once Uncle Gaju is fine,
we'll have a screening

1114
00:52:54,144 --> 00:52:56,200
And you must invite
Priyanka for that show

1115
00:52:56,276 --> 00:52:58,868
That'll be amazing

1116
00:52:59,344 --> 00:53:01,435
Everyone wants to
see that show, right?

1117
00:53:01,510 --> 00:53:02,840
So come on, let's go

1118
00:53:02,910 --> 00:53:03,933
You get on with work

1119
00:53:06,144 --> 00:53:07,132
Please have some

1120
00:53:07,209 --> 00:53:08,733
Raja, you have some too

1121
00:53:09,010 --> 00:53:10,101
Thank you

1122
00:53:10,177 --> 00:53:13,075
Let him work in peace.
Go out, all of you

1123
00:53:13,144 --> 00:53:14,110
Go on, out

1124
00:53:14,177 --> 00:53:16,007
Ashwin, you know what just happened?

1125
00:53:16,377 --> 00:53:18,741
We just spoke to Priyanka Chopra

1126
00:53:18,810 --> 00:53:19,799
It was awesome

1127
00:53:23,310 --> 00:53:25,004
What was that all about?

1128
00:53:25,077 --> 00:53:26,066
Nothing

1129
00:53:26,444 --> 00:53:27,966
They're so funny sometimes

1130
00:53:28,043 --> 00:53:29,737
What do you call it... a 'script'?

1131
00:53:29,810 --> 00:53:31,504
Write a script around them.
It will make for a great film

1132
00:53:34,376 --> 00:53:37,241
Raja, Bhau called me

1133
00:53:38,209 --> 00:53:39,471
His logic is that...

1134
00:53:39,743 --> 00:53:41,402
Ganpati can be
got home after Gauri...

1135
00:53:42,177 --> 00:53:44,040
if we take the correct decision

1136
00:53:44,109 --> 00:53:47,804
He aIso wants to be there
for the meeting with the doctor

1137
00:53:49,176 --> 00:53:50,802
You please handle Bhau

1138
00:53:51,276 --> 00:53:54,140
Ask him to keep his logic to himself

1139
00:53:54,209 --> 00:53:57,108
Tell him not to turn up
here and add to the confusion

1140
00:53:57,343 --> 00:53:59,106
He knows I am here, taking care of it

1141
00:53:59,776 --> 00:54:01,004
More coffee for you?

1142
00:54:01,910 --> 00:54:03,967
Coffee, please

1143
00:54:14,843 --> 00:54:16,002
This is the latest

1144
00:54:17,176 --> 00:54:19,007
It's you!

1145
00:54:19,743 --> 00:54:22,141
I have 3G but I don't know
how to use it

1146
00:54:22,209 --> 00:54:24,869
My dear Uncle,
I'll forward this one to you

1147
00:54:24,944 --> 00:54:26,103
Another coffee

1148
00:54:26,176 --> 00:54:27,199
I'll get it. You sit

1149
00:54:27,276 --> 00:54:28,208
A coffee, quick

1150
00:54:28,276 --> 00:54:29,106
Yes sir

1151
00:54:29,176 --> 00:54:33,131
Uncle, if you don't do this business,
how will people get married?

1152
00:54:33,209 --> 00:54:34,141
That is true

1153
00:54:34,209 --> 00:54:37,005
I wanted to help you too.
But you refused

1154
00:54:37,076 --> 00:54:40,839
You didn't want to get married
till you got elected. Politics etc.

1155
00:54:40,910 --> 00:54:44,137
Your father would've been so happy
if you'd got married at the right time

1156
00:54:50,243 --> 00:54:51,676
I could've never made him happy

1157
00:54:54,376 --> 00:54:55,967
It didn't matter to
him what I did with my life

1158
00:54:56,043 --> 00:54:58,169
Don't say that.
He was worried for you

1159
00:54:58,243 --> 00:54:59,232
Worried for me?

1160
00:54:59,343 --> 00:55:01,673
He wanted me to get a
government job like he had

1161
00:55:01,743 --> 00:55:02,833
I couldn't start a business

1162
00:55:02,976 --> 00:55:06,876
Every father wants his
son to follow in his footsteps

1163
00:55:06,943 --> 00:55:08,204
Just follow?

1164
00:55:08,275 --> 00:55:10,833
Why shouldn't he go ahead
and succeed on his own?

1165
00:55:12,143 --> 00:55:13,700
That's why he was against
my being in politics

1166
00:55:13,776 --> 00:55:15,742
Actually, he disapproved of
everything I did

1167
00:55:15,809 --> 00:55:17,105
Even our political party was divided

1168
00:55:17,176 --> 00:55:18,233
Our leaders went their own ways

1169
00:55:18,776 --> 00:55:21,708
Whom are we supposed to follow?

1170
00:55:22,710 --> 00:55:26,108
If our Ganpati altar
wins the competition...

1171
00:55:26,176 --> 00:55:28,040
it will fortify
my position in the party

1172
00:55:28,777 --> 00:55:29,936
Look how concerned
my father is about me

1173
00:55:30,009 --> 00:55:31,668
He lies in bed as
I am loaded with work

1174
00:55:31,909 --> 00:55:32,807
Don't say that

1175
00:55:32,876 --> 00:55:34,706
He didn't wish to fall ill

1176
00:55:34,776 --> 00:55:36,072
My leader Zantye is just waiting...

1177
00:55:36,143 --> 00:55:38,633
for me to fail so
that his man can take over

1178
00:55:38,742 --> 00:55:39,868
I won't let that happen

1179
00:55:41,943 --> 00:55:43,171
I won't let that happen

1180
00:55:44,109 --> 00:55:46,734
That's why I got
Father to this hospital

1181
00:55:46,809 --> 00:55:48,003
He'll get the best treatment here

1182
00:55:48,143 --> 00:55:48,870
Don't worry

1183
00:55:48,943 --> 00:55:50,909
What am I doing wrong here?

1184
00:55:50,975 --> 00:55:51,806
It'll be fine

1185
00:55:51,876 --> 00:55:53,774
Don't worry.
Everything will be alright

1186
00:55:54,143 --> 00:55:55,166
Don't worry at all

1187
00:55:55,243 --> 00:55:55,969
How much is that?

1188
00:55:56,042 --> 00:55:58,169
Uncle, you don't have to pay

1189
00:55:58,243 --> 00:55:59,731
He'll put it on my account

1190
00:55:59,809 --> 00:56:00,298
Yes sir

1191
00:56:00,576 --> 00:56:02,234
You have an account here as well?

1192
00:56:02,542 --> 00:56:03,167
Of course

1193
00:56:05,109 --> 00:56:07,074
You must throw us a party when you win

1194
00:56:07,142 --> 00:56:08,700
Just this coffee won't do

1195
00:56:08,776 --> 00:56:11,038
Sure. I'll throw a party at
Shivaji Park for you

1196
00:56:11,109 --> 00:56:11,972
Very good

1197
00:56:12,042 --> 00:56:12,838
Cheers to you

1198
00:56:13,075 --> 00:56:14,701
With coffee, for now

1199
00:56:31,609 --> 00:56:32,303
Raja

1200
00:56:33,875 --> 00:56:34,966
Jai, hold on

1201
00:56:35,042 --> 00:56:36,236
I'll call you back

1202
00:56:37,176 --> 00:56:39,267
Raja, this is Aatma Ghadke

1203
00:56:39,575 --> 00:56:41,166
Namaste
- He is Prasanna's neighbour

1204
00:56:42,676 --> 00:56:44,073
He acts in television soaps

1205
00:56:45,008 --> 00:56:47,771
He's been pestering
me to introduce him to you

1206
00:56:48,043 --> 00:56:49,769
Thanks to Uncle Gaju,
he can meet you today

1207
00:56:51,776 --> 00:56:53,674
I wish we didn't have to meet...

1208
00:56:53,742 --> 00:56:55,640
under these circumstances

1209
00:56:56,108 --> 00:56:57,165
I'm sure you know him

1210
00:56:57,475 --> 00:56:59,033
Are you kidding?

1211
00:56:59,109 --> 00:57:02,131
Your comic timing is superb

1212
00:57:03,043 --> 00:57:07,908
Timing is most important in comedy.
Isn't that so, sir?

1213
00:57:10,541 --> 00:57:12,235
Aatma, tell you what...

1214
00:57:12,509 --> 00:57:14,033
Give me your album.
I'll show it to him

1215
00:57:14,108 --> 00:57:15,972
That's great

1216
00:57:16,875 --> 00:57:18,171
I'll wait downstairs

1217
00:57:19,909 --> 00:57:20,897
Raja
- Hello

1218
00:57:23,008 --> 00:57:24,907
What's your take on Uncle Gaju?

1219
00:57:24,976 --> 00:57:26,532
It's almost 2 o'clock

1220
00:57:26,608 --> 00:57:27,574
When will they take a decision?

1221
00:57:27,641 --> 00:57:29,540
We'll have to consult the doctor...

1222
00:57:29,676 --> 00:57:31,698
and then it is
Prasanna's decision

1223
00:57:31,942 --> 00:57:33,033
It's simple

1224
00:57:33,108 --> 00:57:34,700
Who is more important,
Ganpati or man?

1225
00:57:34,908 --> 00:57:36,601
Ganpati must be brought home

1226
00:57:36,808 --> 00:57:39,968
So, till Gauri-Ganpati,
we must keep him on the ventilator

1227
00:57:40,208 --> 00:57:42,731
And after Gauri's immersion,
pull the plug

1228
00:57:42,808 --> 00:57:44,138
What's the confusion there?

1229
00:57:44,208 --> 00:57:46,698
One must be practical

1230
00:57:46,776 --> 00:57:48,605
Take the decision
without wasting time

1231
00:57:48,808 --> 00:57:50,241
Come here

1232
00:57:50,709 --> 00:57:51,834
Give me a minute

1233
00:57:54,875 --> 00:57:55,864
Hello sir

1234
00:57:55,942 --> 00:57:56,773
Hello

1235
00:57:58,841 --> 00:58:01,035
What was he saying, that idiot?

1236
00:58:01,108 --> 00:58:02,973
Uncle Subhash, how are you?

1237
00:58:03,041 --> 00:58:05,599
I am fine,
but what did that doormat say?

1238
00:58:05,675 --> 00:58:06,971
What is wrong with you?

1239
00:58:07,042 --> 00:58:09,406
He said we should continue
with the ventilator till Gauri

1240
00:58:09,608 --> 00:58:10,768
Bloody fool

1241
00:58:10,841 --> 00:58:12,399
Who will pay for it? His father?

1242
00:58:13,008 --> 00:58:14,940
I get Ganpati home for all 10 days

1243
00:58:15,008 --> 00:58:16,838
Why should I take him back by Gauri?

1244
00:58:16,908 --> 00:58:18,534
I won't cut it short

1245
00:58:18,609 --> 00:58:22,041
First immerse that wife of yours,
then bring Ganpati home

1246
00:58:22,108 --> 00:58:25,165
He's so hen-peeked,
his Ganpati leaves with Gauri

1247
00:58:25,474 --> 00:58:27,032
Mine will not

1248
00:58:27,508 --> 00:58:29,736
Or tell Prasanna...

1249
00:58:30,675 --> 00:58:34,540
to keep him for all the
10 Ganpati days, on the ventilator

1250
00:58:35,675 --> 00:58:40,540
Uncle Subhash, Gauri is Ganpati's
mother, not his wife

1251
00:58:42,574 --> 00:58:43,802
Tell me, how much
should I make it out for?

1252
00:58:43,875 --> 00:58:45,432
Who are you making out with?

1253
00:58:45,541 --> 00:58:47,701
Making a receipt for your donation
to the hospital Ganpati

1254
00:58:48,808 --> 00:58:50,002
A hospital Ganpati?

1255
00:58:50,075 --> 00:58:50,733
Yes

1256
00:58:50,807 --> 00:58:51,898
Tell me...

1257
00:58:53,174 --> 00:58:55,540
how is Gauri related to Ganpati?

1258
00:58:55,608 --> 00:58:56,665
She's his wife

1259
00:58:56,741 --> 00:58:59,003
Gauri is Ganpati's mother

1260
00:58:59,541 --> 00:59:00,564
Mother?

1261
00:59:00,708 --> 00:59:01,640
Could be

1262
00:59:01,707 --> 00:59:03,105
Your donation?

1263
00:59:03,808 --> 00:59:05,036
Really?

1264
00:59:13,508 --> 00:59:15,474
Goddess Yogeshwari

1265
00:59:16,374 --> 00:59:17,669
It's afternoon

1266
00:59:17,974 --> 00:59:21,101
And I know you will bless us

1267
00:59:39,574 --> 00:59:40,665
My Goddess Yogeshwari

1268
00:59:40,741 --> 00:59:44,071
Kanchan Kamerkar and his group
are here to seek your blessings

1269
00:59:44,341 --> 00:59:45,102
Yes

1270
00:59:45,374 --> 00:59:46,568
My Goddess Yogeshwari...

1271
00:59:46,641 --> 00:59:50,471
Kanchan Kamerkar's uncle is
very ill in Mumbai

1272
00:59:50,740 --> 00:59:51,730
What is his name?

1273
00:59:51,808 --> 00:59:52,569
Yes

1274
00:59:52,641 --> 00:59:54,606
Yes? What is his name?

1275
00:59:54,674 --> 00:59:55,470
Uncle Gaju

1276
00:59:55,540 --> 00:59:58,803
There are hundreds of
Uncle Gajus. Be specific

1277
00:59:58,875 --> 00:59:59,840
What is his full name?

1278
00:59:59,907 --> 01:00:01,067
Gajanan Kamerkar

1279
01:00:01,341 --> 01:00:02,569
Age?

1280
01:00:02,708 --> 01:00:04,538
Must be 72
- Yes

1281
01:00:04,608 --> 01:00:06,596
My Goddess Yogeshwari,
Gajanan Kamerkar...

1282
01:00:06,674 --> 01:00:08,402
Distant uncle

1283
01:00:08,508 --> 01:00:11,633
age perhaps 72...
Where in Mumbai does he live?

1284
01:00:11,707 --> 01:00:12,367
Dadar

1285
01:00:12,441 --> 01:00:14,771
Not Dadar. He has shifted to Mahim,
near the station

1286
01:00:14,841 --> 01:00:18,637
My Goddess Yogeshwari, he has
shifted to Mahim, near the station

1287
01:00:18,708 --> 01:00:20,037
He is unwell

1288
01:00:20,107 --> 01:00:23,698
That may obstruct the
auspicious events in the family

1289
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:28,864
My Goddess Yogeshwari, till
he gets better, Kanchan and his group...

1290
01:00:29,341 --> 01:00:31,898
will pray to you non-stop

1291
01:00:34,907 --> 01:00:37,339
I will be in and around,
but all of them are here

1292
01:00:37,407 --> 01:00:38,669
Yes!

1293
01:00:38,807 --> 01:00:40,773
If you grant them their wish...

1294
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:43,102
- they will offer 5 coconuts...
- Yes!

1295
01:00:43,373 --> 01:00:44,999
- ...a quarter kilo of coloured powder...
- Yes!

1296
01:00:45,074 --> 01:00:47,403
- A kilo of pedhas...
- Yes!

1297
01:00:47,473 --> 01:00:48,906
At your feet

1298
01:00:48,974 --> 01:00:52,634
Hail Goddess Yogeshwari!

1299
01:01:06,507 --> 01:01:07,474
Namaste

1300
01:01:09,674 --> 01:01:10,606
Jai

1301
01:01:10,674 --> 01:01:12,402
Today's trial list is confirmed

1302
01:01:12,573 --> 01:01:13,868
Perhaps I won't be able to make it

1303
01:01:14,774 --> 01:01:17,298
Get a confirmation from catering

1304
01:01:17,374 --> 01:01:18,033
OK, let me check

1305
01:01:20,340 --> 01:01:21,773
OK, the menu is good

1306
01:01:23,308 --> 01:01:25,535
Call me if you need me, OK?

1307
01:01:25,607 --> 01:01:26,539
I'll be waiting

1308
01:01:28,573 --> 01:01:30,801
Raja, I'll be back in awhile

1309
01:01:30,873 --> 01:01:32,738
I have a few calIs to make,
in Churchgate

1310
01:01:32,807 --> 01:01:34,671
Have you met my son, Karan?

1311
01:01:37,707 --> 01:01:38,673
Daddy, Uncle Raja

1312
01:01:38,740 --> 01:01:40,671
Don't forget about the screening

1313
01:01:40,739 --> 01:01:41,535
Yes

1314
01:01:41,607 --> 01:01:42,334
And call Priyanka

1315
01:01:42,407 --> 01:01:43,271
- OK?
- OK

1316
01:01:43,340 --> 01:01:44,397
This is for the prayer ritual

1317
01:01:44,507 --> 01:01:46,564
I know but I have to check everything

1318
01:01:46,940 --> 01:01:48,703
How dare you talk to me this way?

1319
01:01:48,774 --> 01:01:50,002
Whose union is it in the hospital?

1320
01:01:50,274 --> 01:01:50,831
Call him

1321
01:01:50,907 --> 01:01:52,703
There goes Ajit

1322
01:01:52,873 --> 01:01:55,034
I should leave. I'm running late

1323
01:01:55,308 --> 01:01:55,830
Bye

1324
01:01:55,907 --> 01:01:56,872
Let's go. Hurry

1325
01:01:56,940 --> 01:01:58,668
It's Ganpati decorations, not a bomb

1326
01:01:58,740 --> 01:02:00,228
- How are you?
- Fine. How are you?

1327
01:02:00,307 --> 01:02:01,240
Not so loud, we're in a hospital

1328
01:02:01,308 --> 01:02:02,535
Yes. Are you leaving?

1329
01:02:02,607 --> 01:02:03,596
Yes, I must

1330
01:02:03,674 --> 01:02:05,436
This is all for Ganpati

1331
01:02:05,507 --> 01:02:06,735
What is wrong?

1332
01:02:06,807 --> 01:02:08,772
I'm telling him he
can't take this inside

1333
01:02:08,839 --> 01:02:10,363
But he won't listen to me

1334
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:12,838
Ajit, let him do his job

1335
01:02:13,839 --> 01:02:14,704
How are you?

1336
01:02:14,774 --> 01:02:15,706
I'm fine

1337
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:18,867
You better pack it up again

1338
01:02:21,340 --> 01:02:22,329
Manmeet

1339
01:02:23,340 --> 01:02:24,737
How are you?

1340
01:02:24,806 --> 01:02:25,864
Good

1341
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:28,638
You've grown taller than your father

1342
01:02:28,706 --> 01:02:30,230
You know, I shave now

1343
01:02:31,707 --> 01:02:33,729
Your daddy seems to
have bought you a lot of things

1344
01:02:33,806 --> 01:02:35,966
It's a new kurta for Ganpati

1345
01:02:36,407 --> 01:02:37,771
Shall I wear it right now?

1346
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:38,635
Sure

1347
01:02:38,706 --> 01:02:41,469
Right now,
go help your father with the bags

1348
01:02:41,940 --> 01:02:44,907
Uncle Raja, I watch all your films

1349
01:02:44,973 --> 01:02:47,668
Daddy gets the CD a
day before the film releases

1350
01:02:47,740 --> 01:02:48,831
We watch it everyday

1351
01:02:48,907 --> 01:02:49,736
Really?

1352
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:53,968
Hurry UP

1353
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:55,229
There's nothing in it

1354
01:02:55,306 --> 01:02:56,273
You go there

1355
01:02:57,173 --> 01:02:58,367
It's 4 o'clock

1356
01:02:58,607 --> 01:03:01,573
We won't take any decision till
everyone from the village gets here

1357
01:03:02,307 --> 01:03:04,899
Zantye is cribbing that the
idol doesn't have a natural radiance

1358
01:03:05,172 --> 01:03:06,502
How do you get that radiance?

1359
01:03:06,572 --> 01:03:07,663
You must go there

1360
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:10,332
Dude, is it your first or second?

1361
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:11,269
First

1362
01:03:11,339 --> 01:03:12,499
Lovely

1363
01:03:12,639 --> 01:03:13,901
The great magician is here

1364
01:03:14,173 --> 01:03:15,264
Don't act smart

1365
01:03:15,340 --> 01:03:16,635
Uncle Sai

1366
01:03:16,706 --> 01:03:18,434
I'm off
- OK, you go

1367
01:03:18,506 --> 01:03:20,837
The magician is here

1368
01:03:23,340 --> 01:03:24,306
- How're you, bro?
- Fine

1369
01:03:24,373 --> 01:03:26,271
Magician, now that you're here...

1370
01:03:26,340 --> 01:03:29,170
get Uncle Gaju off the ventilator
- Stop it, Sai

1371
01:03:29,539 --> 01:03:31,131
Why did Prasanna leave in a huff?

1372
01:03:31,773 --> 01:03:32,864
What is the situation upstairs?

1373
01:03:33,172 --> 01:03:36,265
Situation's the same, but the plan's changed
- Why?

1374
01:03:36,340 --> 01:03:38,465
When the village gang is here,
we'll decide

1375
01:03:38,539 --> 01:03:40,767
Seems like we'll have
to spend the night here

1376
01:03:40,839 --> 01:03:42,169
You stay right here

1377
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:43,137
I'll just be back

1378
01:03:43,205 --> 01:03:44,535
Don't mess around

1379
01:03:44,606 --> 01:03:45,834
Sai, take this

1380
01:03:48,205 --> 01:03:49,228
Keep an eye on him

1381
01:03:53,239 --> 01:03:54,262
Are you hungry?

1382
01:03:54,773 --> 01:03:55,637
I knew it

1383
01:03:56,273 --> 01:03:57,205
How many kilos will you eat?

1384
01:03:57,273 --> 01:03:58,705
Yes Nandan, speak to Aunty Manda

1385
01:03:59,472 --> 01:04:00,302
Nandan

1386
01:04:01,606 --> 01:04:02,471
Taxi

1387
01:04:02,539 --> 01:04:03,699
Have a taxi ready

1388
01:04:04,439 --> 01:04:06,633
Can you do me a favour?

1389
01:04:06,706 --> 01:04:07,570
Yes, what is it?

1390
01:04:07,673 --> 01:04:09,503
May I just go out for a while?

1391
01:04:10,072 --> 01:04:12,437
- Where?
- I have some urgent work

1392
01:04:12,639 --> 01:04:13,503
Please don't tell Dada

1393
01:04:13,572 --> 01:04:14,595
He'll get mad at me

1394
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:17,434
Please

1395
01:04:19,539 --> 01:04:20,130
OK

1396
01:04:20,205 --> 01:04:21,194
Thank you Raja dada

1397
01:04:21,272 --> 01:04:22,102
Get the taxi

1398
01:04:22,306 --> 01:04:24,069
I'll call you back

1399
01:04:25,673 --> 01:04:27,070
Where is he off to?

1400
01:04:27,673 --> 01:04:28,662
He's caught up in some mess

1401
01:04:33,372 --> 01:04:34,839
Listen to me
- Where is he going?

1402
01:04:35,538 --> 01:04:37,505
His father's on the ventilator
and where is he off to?

1403
01:04:37,739 --> 01:04:42,365
He'll be back.
Where eIse will he go?

1404
01:04:43,172 --> 01:04:45,639
I don't think our meeting
in the village will happen this time

1405
01:04:45,706 --> 01:04:46,569
Why?

1406
01:04:46,638 --> 01:04:47,662
Have you been upstairs?

1407
01:04:49,706 --> 01:04:52,172
Do you remember Gaja bhau
had given up all rights...

1408
01:04:52,372 --> 01:04:55,634
to his share of the
property in the last meeting?

1409
01:04:56,073 --> 01:04:56,537
When?

1410
01:04:56,605 --> 01:04:58,038
He wasn't there, I remember

1411
01:04:58,105 --> 01:04:59,731
Prasanna won't let go so easily

1412
01:05:00,005 --> 01:05:01,733
I'm sure he'll protest

1413
01:05:02,005 --> 01:05:03,698
If Gaja bhau gives up his
rights, many of our problems...

1414
01:05:03,772 --> 01:05:08,330
will be solved,
including the toilet issue

1415
01:05:08,439 --> 01:05:09,564
What about my mangoes?

1416
01:05:09,639 --> 01:05:11,002
I had warned you

1417
01:05:11,072 --> 01:05:14,095
You should have kept
a rough draft ready

1418
01:05:14,172 --> 01:05:15,332
None of you bothered to do that

1419
01:05:15,439 --> 01:05:16,633
It would have come in handy now

1420
01:05:17,339 --> 01:05:18,668
Tell me, how will you
get his signatures now?

1421
01:05:18,738 --> 01:05:20,398
We can get his thumb impression

1422
01:05:20,472 --> 01:05:21,666
It's your responsibility then

1423
01:05:21,739 --> 01:05:24,727
Get a lawyer, make an affidavit
and get his thumb impression on it

1424
01:05:25,005 --> 01:05:25,528
Go

1425
01:05:25,606 --> 01:05:27,072
Be practical

1426
01:05:27,139 --> 01:05:27,697
Tell him

1427
01:05:27,773 --> 01:05:29,102
This is impossible

1428
01:05:29,239 --> 01:05:30,727
We must speak to Prasanna

1429
01:05:31,005 --> 01:05:32,267
I'm not going to talk to Prasanna

1430
01:05:32,339 --> 01:05:34,464
- Why?
- He's full of himself

1431
01:05:34,538 --> 01:05:36,005
He thinks he's some big shot

1432
01:05:36,072 --> 01:05:39,732
Bhau is a witness
to our last discussion

1433
01:05:40,005 --> 01:05:41,562
He isn't here yet

1434
01:05:41,705 --> 01:05:42,762
But Raja is here

1435
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:43,767
What if he doesn't come here at all?

1436
01:05:44,039 --> 01:05:45,199
He will. He will be here

1437
01:05:45,405 --> 01:05:47,202
Does Pritam send you the mangoes?

1438
01:05:47,272 --> 01:05:48,636
You call Bhau

1439
01:05:49,372 --> 01:05:50,531
Mangoes!

1440
01:05:50,672 --> 01:05:51,638
Look

1441
01:05:52,039 --> 01:05:52,766
Yes, hello Rashmi

1442
01:05:53,039 --> 01:05:54,563
I couldn't call you before

1443
01:05:54,639 --> 01:05:56,297
Uncle Bandhu and I are in the same car

1444
01:05:56,405 --> 01:05:58,304
I can't say anything in front of him

1445
01:05:58,406 --> 01:06:01,667
Our toilet lady is in the car with me

1446
01:06:01,939 --> 01:06:03,531
- Who?
- Rashmi

1447
01:06:03,605 --> 01:06:05,662
Uncle Bandhu came to
spend his retired life...

1448
01:06:05,939 --> 01:06:08,133
in the village
to make our life hell

1449
01:06:08,205 --> 01:06:09,967
She wants to build a toilet

1450
01:06:10,272 --> 01:06:11,135
You know where?

1451
01:06:11,204 --> 01:06:14,365
Right in the middle
of our room and the well

1452
01:06:14,571 --> 01:06:16,298
I have already refused

1453
01:06:20,005 --> 01:06:21,596
You don't go soft on them

1454
01:06:21,672 --> 01:06:22,695
Let me make it clear

1455
01:06:22,972 --> 01:06:26,166
I have suffered. I won't
let my daughter suffer

1456
01:06:26,239 --> 01:06:27,602
I'm in a similar position, Rashmi

1457
01:06:27,672 --> 01:06:30,139
Every year at Ganpati they promise
me they'll discuss the matter and...

1458
01:06:30,205 --> 01:06:32,569
every year they leave
me hanging with my toilet

1459
01:06:32,638 --> 01:06:34,105
Am I right?

1460
01:06:34,438 --> 01:06:38,166
If she brings it up, we'll discuss it

1461
01:06:38,238 --> 01:06:40,568
You live in the city
so you don't have any issues

1462
01:06:40,972 --> 01:06:46,098
I refuse to spend the rest
of my life living next to a toilet

1463
01:06:46,172 --> 01:06:48,331
I'm telling you, this
time this matter has to be...

1464
01:06:48,438 --> 01:06:51,064
closed, and you
better speak up for me

1465
01:06:51,139 --> 01:06:52,401
Of course

1466
01:06:52,471 --> 01:06:54,631
We'll begin with my mangoes

1467
01:06:54,705 --> 01:06:58,070
Why do you go on and
on with your mangoes?

1468
01:06:58,139 --> 01:07:00,298
Where will you go after
eating so many mangoes?

1469
01:07:00,371 --> 01:07:01,633
Straight to the toilet, right?

1470
01:07:01,905 --> 01:07:03,065
That's enough. You're useless!

1471
01:07:03,139 --> 01:07:04,070
I'll handle it

1472
01:07:06,505 --> 01:07:09,199
How can you be so
patient with your father?

1473
01:07:10,004 --> 01:07:12,232
I can't do that even for a minute

1474
01:07:13,571 --> 01:07:14,968
I know that feeling

1475
01:07:15,605 --> 01:07:18,936
But it's like brushing

1476
01:07:19,139 --> 01:07:20,104
Yes, think about it

1477
01:07:20,238 --> 01:07:23,068
We must brush everyday,
to keep our teeth clean

1478
01:07:23,571 --> 01:07:25,333
Relationships are like teeth

1479
01:07:26,038 --> 01:07:27,300
You have to keep them clean

1480
01:07:27,405 --> 01:07:28,303
Brush them

1481
01:07:28,405 --> 01:07:29,235
It's tough, yes

1482
01:07:31,104 --> 01:07:31,592
Here

1483
01:07:32,305 --> 01:07:33,396
Pritam

1484
01:07:33,471 --> 01:07:34,301
What does he want?

1485
01:07:34,505 --> 01:07:36,232
Yes, Pritam?

1486
01:07:36,305 --> 01:07:38,397
Dada, everyone is coming there

1487
01:07:38,471 --> 01:07:40,869
We had to come in 2 cars

1488
01:07:40,938 --> 01:07:43,064
Yes I know about the 2 cars

1489
01:07:43,138 --> 01:07:43,968
Everyone's on their way

1490
01:07:44,038 --> 01:07:47,471
No one cares when
Uncle Gajanan visits us

1491
01:07:47,537 --> 01:07:50,334
But look at them now, traveling
all the way to Mumbai to see him

1492
01:07:51,938 --> 01:07:57,099
I told everyone in the
village not to tell anyone eIse

1493
01:07:57,171 --> 01:08:00,502
You've told everyone
not to tell anyone?

1494
01:08:02,404 --> 01:08:03,371
What about Rajan?

1495
01:08:03,437 --> 01:08:06,427
He called him 'Uncle Gajanan's body'

1496
01:08:08,104 --> 01:08:09,468
He has no sense

1497
01:08:11,872 --> 01:08:13,530
He'll leave tonight

1498
01:08:13,904 --> 01:08:15,530
He wants to go shopping in Mumbai

1499
01:08:15,938 --> 01:08:18,370
He wants to finish
peeing as he's bathing

1500
01:08:18,971 --> 01:08:21,801
Never mind. Now try and get here soon

1501
01:08:21,871 --> 01:08:22,531
We're waiting for you

1502
01:08:22,805 --> 01:08:23,861
OK

1503
01:08:24,971 --> 01:08:27,495
Tatya, don't you dare
have any more water

1504
01:08:46,270 --> 01:08:48,135
Uncle, I want this one

1505
01:08:49,471 --> 01:08:50,800
Hurry UP

1506
01:08:52,470 --> 01:08:53,800
Here you go, skinny fellow

1507
01:08:54,171 --> 01:08:55,295
This is plastic

1508
01:08:55,370 --> 01:08:56,427
Don't eat this

1509
01:08:56,504 --> 01:08:57,334
I know

1510
01:08:57,404 --> 01:08:59,428
Don't drop it on your clothes

1511
01:08:59,505 --> 01:09:01,402
Your father will bash us up

1512
01:09:02,504 --> 01:09:04,028
Don't yell at me

1513
01:09:04,104 --> 01:09:05,830
I'll change after I eat

1514
01:10:04,937 --> 01:10:05,869
Daddy

1515
01:10:05,937 --> 01:10:06,994
Daddy

1516
01:10:16,903 --> 01:10:17,802
Daddy

1517
01:10:19,237 --> 01:10:20,067
Daddy

1518
01:10:20,203 --> 01:10:21,226
Daddy
- What's wrong?

1519
01:10:21,304 --> 01:10:22,168
Daddy

1520
01:10:24,837 --> 01:10:25,893
Daddy

1521
01:10:28,237 --> 01:10:31,295
Daddy, Daddy, Daddy

1522
01:10:31,336 --> 01:10:32,360
Manmeet

1523
01:10:32,736 --> 01:10:33,498
What's going on?

1524
01:10:33,771 --> 01:10:36,135
Uncle, there's a coin in my tummy!

1525
01:10:36,803 --> 01:10:37,826
- A coin?
- Yes

1526
01:10:37,903 --> 01:10:39,131
Get it out

1527
01:10:39,203 --> 01:10:40,101
Here?

1528
01:10:40,170 --> 01:10:40,966
Yes

1529
01:10:41,037 --> 01:10:41,969
OK, relax

1530
01:10:42,037 --> 01:10:42,832
Come with me

1531
01:10:42,903 --> 01:10:43,733
Relax

1532
01:10:43,803 --> 01:10:44,770
Where's the OPD?

1533
01:10:44,836 --> 01:10:45,803
To your right

1534
01:10:45,871 --> 01:10:46,802
OK, come on

1535
01:11:35,002 --> 01:11:35,833
Look at this

1536
01:11:36,269 --> 01:11:37,997
This is where the coin is stuck

1537
01:11:38,703 --> 01:11:39,362
Good God!

1538
01:11:39,736 --> 01:11:40,759
Now what do we do?

1539
01:11:42,170 --> 01:11:45,727
If he's lucky enough,
it'll come out in his morning potty

1540
01:11:46,102 --> 01:11:48,331
Give him a lot of bananas today

1541
01:11:48,670 --> 01:11:50,067
That will help the motions

1542
01:11:50,136 --> 01:11:53,398
Or we'll have to extract it surgically

1543
01:11:53,903 --> 01:11:56,198
Uncle, I don't want a surgery

1544
01:11:56,269 --> 01:11:58,326
I will do a lot of potty

1545
01:11:59,636 --> 01:12:01,033
No surgery, please

1546
01:12:01,869 --> 01:12:02,859
Here he is

1547
01:12:02,937 --> 01:12:05,165
Why are you wearing
this kurta right now?

1548
01:12:05,237 --> 01:12:06,327
I'll give you one!

1549
01:12:06,603 --> 01:12:07,296
Ajit

1550
01:12:07,369 --> 01:12:08,927
There's a coin in his stomach

1551
01:12:09,003 --> 01:12:11,934
It must be hidden in
some corner of this large mass

1552
01:12:12,002 --> 01:12:14,697
It's only a coin.
He could digest a man whole

1553
01:12:16,170 --> 01:12:17,862
Coin. There's a coin in his stomach

1554
01:12:19,670 --> 01:12:20,727
Coin?

1555
01:12:20,803 --> 01:12:22,269
You mean there's a coin inside him?

1556
01:12:22,336 --> 01:12:23,632
How did it get there?

1557
01:12:23,703 --> 01:12:24,897
He was performing a magic trick

1558
01:12:25,336 --> 01:12:26,302
I said No Magic!

1559
01:12:26,369 --> 01:12:27,892
Calm down

1560
01:12:29,736 --> 01:12:30,725
He is only a child

1561
01:12:30,803 --> 01:12:32,327
You were just like
him when you were young

1562
01:12:32,602 --> 01:12:33,125
So keep shut

1563
01:12:33,202 --> 01:12:34,726
You come with me

1564
01:12:34,803 --> 01:12:36,963
We'll have some bananas

1565
01:12:37,037 --> 01:12:39,594
The coin will slip
right out in the morning

1566
01:12:39,670 --> 01:12:40,898
Come with me

1567
01:12:40,969 --> 01:12:42,095
Can I have some cheese pizza?

1568
01:12:43,069 --> 01:12:43,899
Be quiet

1569
01:12:43,969 --> 01:12:45,367
Go change those clothes

1570
01:12:46,870 --> 01:12:48,357
Bhau's logic is spot on

1571
01:12:48,769 --> 01:12:49,735
What logic?

1572
01:12:49,802 --> 01:12:51,269
It's preposterous

1573
01:12:51,803 --> 01:12:53,326
Who cares what he says?

1574
01:12:53,869 --> 01:12:55,131
He thinks practically

1575
01:12:55,202 --> 01:12:56,100
He is correct

1576
01:12:56,703 --> 01:12:59,794
Correct?
Let Gaju take his own decisions

1577
01:12:59,869 --> 01:13:01,961
Then why was he interfering
during the meeting?

1578
01:13:02,102 --> 01:13:04,830
He is so concerned about
keeping the family together

1579
01:13:04,902 --> 01:13:06,766
Who does he think he is?

1580
01:13:12,036 --> 01:13:15,195
So what do you suggest I do?

1581
01:13:16,802 --> 01:13:18,565
I should keep myself out of all this?

1582
01:13:18,770 --> 01:13:21,861
All my relatives are here
to see my brother...

1583
01:13:22,802 --> 01:13:26,666
and I should sit at home
and worry about the chaos?

1584
01:13:27,036 --> 01:13:30,832
Dad, I understand your feelings for
your younger brother

1585
01:13:31,201 --> 01:13:34,896
But I don't understand that when
I told you that I'm already here...

1586
01:13:35,303 --> 01:13:37,268
then why did you
take a bus all the way here?

1587
01:13:38,102 --> 01:13:39,795
What if you had a fall, an accident?

1588
01:13:46,236 --> 01:13:47,724
Why are you so upset with me?

1589
01:13:48,769 --> 01:13:50,293
You don't like the way I dress

1590
01:13:50,936 --> 01:13:53,698
You don't like it when
I carry a plastic bag

1591
01:13:54,869 --> 01:13:58,768
You are furious when I leave the
house with a napkin on my shoulders

1592
01:13:59,735 --> 01:14:02,928
Why should I spend the rest of my
life according to what you approve of?

1593
01:14:04,869 --> 01:14:07,495
Dad, this is not the right time

1594
01:14:08,769 --> 01:14:09,826
But let me say it

1595
01:14:11,735 --> 01:14:15,066
This is exactly what I wanted
to say to you after my board results

1596
01:14:15,869 --> 01:14:17,665
You wouldn't have any of it

1597
01:14:17,735 --> 01:14:21,497
You wanted your son to be a CA,
so you forced me to study commerce

1598
01:14:21,568 --> 01:14:22,796
Did I succeed at it?

1599
01:14:24,769 --> 01:14:26,667
That is exactly what
you did with Mom too

1600
01:14:27,735 --> 01:14:30,030
She lived the life of a wife
that you had imagined for yourself

1601
01:14:30,769 --> 01:14:33,792
You got her so
dependent on you that...

1602
01:14:33,869 --> 01:14:36,767
she wouldn't take her
daily medication without your help

1603
01:14:36,969 --> 01:14:37,764
Why?

1604
01:14:38,069 --> 01:14:39,693
Because she didn't
want to hurt your feelings

1605
01:14:40,769 --> 01:14:42,826
She gave up her own identity

1606
01:14:44,802 --> 01:14:48,099
She overdosed on
that medication and died

1607
01:14:49,036 --> 01:14:52,002
I did it all to protect her

1608
01:14:53,101 --> 01:14:54,568
I had no selfish interest in it

1609
01:14:54,635 --> 01:14:55,862
But you thought only about yourself

1610
01:14:56,568 --> 01:14:57,693
And you still do

1611
01:14:58,936 --> 01:15:03,630
Why did you have to come here with all
your logic and try to grab attention?

1612
01:15:04,568 --> 01:15:08,000
Everyone laughs at
you behind your back

1613
01:15:08,835 --> 01:15:11,960
The equations in a joint family are
complicated, my dear

1614
01:15:12,968 --> 01:15:17,901
If you truly believe I have
created confusion in their minds...

1615
01:15:20,402 --> 01:15:21,664
then I'll leave right away

1616
01:15:22,734 --> 01:15:24,826
I have changed myself right now

1617
01:15:25,669 --> 01:15:26,658
You handle it all

1618
01:15:36,035 --> 01:15:40,525
My love didn't kill your mother

1619
01:15:42,001 --> 01:15:43,763
Habit is to blame here

1620
01:15:45,068 --> 01:15:47,763
She wasn't used to
doing anything without me

1621
01:15:49,168 --> 01:15:53,601
And I couldn't give up my habit
of taking care of everything for her

1622
01:15:55,101 --> 01:16:01,830
I couldn't strike a balance
between love and habit

1623
01:16:05,401 --> 01:16:08,494
She is gone

1624
01:16:30,468 --> 01:16:31,433
No, sir

1625
01:16:31,501 --> 01:16:32,797
I can't make any last minute changes

1626
01:16:32,868 --> 01:16:33,663
Give me a solution

1627
01:16:33,734 --> 01:16:36,099
You have no idea what you want

1628
01:16:36,367 --> 01:16:37,333
You say it lacks radiance

1629
01:16:37,401 --> 01:16:38,367
What exactly does that mean?

1630
01:16:38,434 --> 01:16:40,026
All my idoIs are dear to me

1631
01:16:40,801 --> 01:16:43,460
I want each one of
them to win the competition

1632
01:16:43,567 --> 01:16:45,932
Who is the sculptor, you or I?

1633
01:16:46,635 --> 01:16:48,964
You have been checking
on the progress of the idol

1634
01:16:49,035 --> 01:16:50,592
Why didn't you say anything then?

1635
01:16:50,668 --> 01:16:52,066
Suddenly, what has gone so wrong?

1636
01:16:52,434 --> 01:16:54,526
If I knew that,
why would I be standing here when...

1637
01:16:54,601 --> 01:16:57,499
my father is fighting
for his life in hospital?

1638
01:16:58,834 --> 01:16:59,891
Are you getting me?

1639
01:17:06,601 --> 01:17:08,727
Sir, trust me when I say this

1640
01:17:10,301 --> 01:17:11,699
The festival is around the corner

1641
01:17:12,501 --> 01:17:15,365
They say the idoIs already
have His presence in them

1642
01:17:15,968 --> 01:17:16,866
So?

1643
01:17:18,435 --> 01:17:23,334
Such last minute
changes are a bad omen

1644
01:17:23,601 --> 01:17:24,794
That's what they say

1645
01:17:27,401 --> 01:17:28,300
I'll be back

1646
01:17:28,801 --> 01:17:30,563
Get on with work

1647
01:17:33,567 --> 01:17:35,999
<i>With your grace upon us</i>

1648
01:17:36,267 --> 01:17:38,893
<i>You fill us with happiness and peace</i>

1649
01:17:38,968 --> 01:17:42,025
<i>You are the divine support</i>

1650
01:17:42,301 --> 01:17:44,734
<i>You absorb and act</i>

1651
01:17:45,301 --> 01:17:47,926
<i>You're our mother, our father</i>

1652
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,932
<i>You're everyone': brother,
everyone's friend</i>

1653
01:17:51,501 --> 01:17:57,922
<i>Bestow your blessings on us, dear Lord</i>

1654
01:18:12,533 --> 01:18:15,501
Come one, come all

1655
01:18:15,567 --> 01:18:18,431
<i>Let's welcome Lord Ganesha...</i>

1656
01:18:18,500 --> 01:18:21,399
<i>singing hymns to His greatness</i>

1657
01:18:21,467 --> 01:18:24,434
<i>Hail Lord Ganesha</i>

1658
01:18:24,501 --> 01:18:27,490
<i>Hail the joy-giver</i>

1659
01:18:42,567 --> 01:18:45,261
Come one, come all

1660
01:18:45,334 --> 01:18:47,959
<i>Let's welcome Lord Ganesha...</i>

1661
01:18:48,234 --> 01:18:50,723
<i>singing hymns to His greatness</i>

1662
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:53,460
<i>Hail Lord Ganesha</i>

1663
01:18:53,534 --> 01:18:55,863
<i>Hail the joy-giver</i>

1664
01:19:03,334 --> 01:19:05,629
Come one, come all

1665
01:19:05,700 --> 01:19:07,792
<i>Let's welcome Lord Ganesha...</i>

1666
01:19:07,867 --> 01:19:10,424
<i>singing hymns to His greatness</i>

1667
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:12,660
<i>Hail Lord Ganesha</i>

1668
01:19:12,733 --> 01:19:15,597
<i>Hail the joy-giver</i>

1669
01:19:28,533 --> 01:19:29,227
Dada

1670
01:19:31,466 --> 01:19:32,193
Come on

1671
01:19:33,733 --> 01:19:35,756
Why is this thing blocking the way?

1672
01:19:37,233 --> 01:19:38,256
Stand here

1673
01:19:40,600 --> 01:19:41,793
Bandhu

1674
01:19:43,733 --> 01:19:45,200
Tatya, don't do that

1675
01:19:45,800 --> 01:19:46,426
Here you go

1676
01:19:46,533 --> 01:19:47,522
Let him go

1677
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:50,362
Hurry up or you'll
have to clean up behind him

1678
01:19:50,433 --> 01:19:51,729
Hurry up, Tatya

1679
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:52,697
Let's go

1680
01:19:52,766 --> 01:19:54,824
1-2-3-4

1681
01:19:57,632 --> 01:19:58,860
How are you, Pritam?

1682
01:19:59,500 --> 01:20:01,592
Mother, give me the bag

1683
01:20:04,433 --> 01:20:05,627
Go on inside

1684
01:20:07,333 --> 01:20:08,322
When did you leave?

1685
01:20:08,632 --> 01:20:09,599
Around noon

1686
01:20:09,667 --> 01:20:10,792
It took you a long time

1687
01:20:11,199 --> 01:20:14,427
We've come from Kolhapur, yet
we've reached at the same time as you

1688
01:20:15,633 --> 01:20:18,826
Try stuffing so many oldies
in 2 cars and driving all the way

1689
01:20:19,333 --> 01:20:20,697
I'm lucky to have reached

1690
01:20:20,766 --> 01:20:22,665
My mother was my back-seat driver

1691
01:20:22,733 --> 01:20:26,359
I'll go on inside. You get my bag

1692
01:20:28,266 --> 01:20:30,255
He woke up in the morning as usual

1693
01:20:30,333 --> 01:20:33,789
Had some tea and biscuits
and went to the market

1694
01:20:34,366 --> 01:20:36,264
Said he'd have breakfast later...

1695
01:20:36,333 --> 01:20:38,356
eIse the market would get busy

1696
01:20:38,433 --> 01:20:40,865
Aunty Manda

1697
01:20:43,233 --> 01:20:45,358
What happened to him?

1698
01:20:45,432 --> 01:20:48,161
He woke up in the morning as usual

1699
01:20:48,233 --> 01:20:51,460
Had some tea and biscuits
and went to the market

1700
01:20:51,899 --> 01:20:54,264
He was so fit and healthy

1701
01:20:57,432 --> 01:20:59,559
He is bed-ridden

1702
01:21:01,532 --> 01:21:03,828
See what's become of her

1703
01:21:07,632 --> 01:21:08,292
Sorry

1704
01:21:08,366 --> 01:21:10,059
Ashwin, tell me...

1705
01:21:10,133 --> 01:21:13,065
who all will
go up to see Gaju, now?

1706
01:21:14,666 --> 01:21:16,258
Where is Bhau?

1707
01:21:17,132 --> 01:21:18,223
He has gone back home

1708
01:21:18,399 --> 01:21:19,366
Where is Prasanna?

1709
01:21:19,499 --> 01:21:20,625
He'll be here

1710
01:21:20,699 --> 01:21:23,597
Father, I think you siblings
must go and see Uncle Gaju

1711
01:21:23,832 --> 01:21:27,094
I want to meet him too

1712
01:21:27,166 --> 01:21:28,393
Don't get ahead of yourself

1713
01:21:28,465 --> 01:21:29,556
You can wait

1714
01:21:30,666 --> 01:21:31,531
Pritam

1715
01:21:32,767 --> 01:21:35,323
I want a ventilator for myself

1716
01:21:35,399 --> 01:21:37,764
Yes, it's upstairs

1717
01:21:38,699 --> 01:21:41,722
Fresh air

1718
01:22:04,633 --> 01:22:08,293
Bandhu, which one
of these is a ventilator?

1719
01:22:12,465 --> 01:22:13,659
It's behind the Ganpati

1720
01:22:25,532 --> 01:22:26,464
Gaju

1721
01:22:27,499 --> 01:22:28,761
Gaju

1722
01:22:30,233 --> 01:22:31,664
Gaju, please wake up

1723
01:22:32,299 --> 01:22:33,288
Wake up

1724
01:22:36,166 --> 01:22:37,290
Look here

1725
01:22:38,299 --> 01:22:39,663
Look who's here

1726
01:22:40,632 --> 01:22:44,428
Tatya has come here to
take you back for Ganpati

1727
01:22:44,732 --> 01:22:47,629
He's traveled all this way for you

1728
01:22:48,198 --> 01:22:53,154
If you're not there,
who will do the Ganpati aarti?

1729
01:22:54,998 --> 01:23:00,659
None of us knows the Ganpati
preparations as well as you do

1730
01:23:01,499 --> 01:23:02,431
Truly

1731
01:23:08,133 --> 01:23:09,223
Listen

1732
01:23:10,265 --> 01:23:12,163
Gaju, have you heard?

1733
01:23:13,599 --> 01:23:18,361
Bandhu's grandson
Pat is coming to India

1734
01:23:20,065 --> 01:23:24,930
He is just like you, fair-skinned

1735
01:23:31,432 --> 01:23:34,922
Sis, do you remember how
Gaju became so fair-skinned?

1736
01:23:35,331 --> 01:23:37,526
He was quite dusky when he was born

1737
01:23:38,299 --> 01:23:39,561
H ow?

1738
01:23:40,431 --> 01:23:45,126
Remember there used to be tins of
Afghan Snow in the attic of our store?

1739
01:23:45,399 --> 01:23:47,387
He used to smear
himself with that snow

1740
01:23:47,464 --> 01:23:48,953
That's how he's so fair-skinned

1741
01:23:49,499 --> 01:23:53,193
Once Tatya caught him
putting snow on his face

1742
01:23:53,265 --> 01:23:54,924
He thrashed him soundly

1743
01:23:55,165 --> 01:23:57,154
Should I thrash you now?

1744
01:23:57,564 --> 01:23:59,531
You are getting such fresh air...

1745
01:23:59,998 --> 01:24:02,157
but you're still not waking up

1746
01:24:02,865 --> 01:24:04,627
Gaju

1747
01:24:04,898 --> 01:24:06,092
Gaju

1748
01:24:06,165 --> 01:24:09,859
Gajanan, wake up

1749
01:24:11,632 --> 01:24:14,598
You tell him please

1750
01:24:14,865 --> 01:24:19,162
Gaju, please open
your eyes and look at us

1751
01:24:20,498 --> 01:24:23,362
Please look at us

1752
01:24:38,265 --> 01:24:39,321
I hope this is without sugar

1753
01:24:39,398 --> 01:24:41,262
Of course,
it's made especially for you

1754
01:24:45,898 --> 01:24:46,989
It's good

1755
01:24:49,132 --> 01:24:53,122
Prasanna,
I came here from the hospital

1756
01:24:54,432 --> 01:24:55,397
What do I see here?

1757
01:24:56,097 --> 01:24:57,257
The idol has absolutely no radiance

1758
01:25:00,031 --> 01:25:02,123
Gurav's an is impeccable

1759
01:25:03,065 --> 01:25:04,929
You are decorating
it with jewellery

1760
01:25:06,364 --> 01:25:09,195
And yet I smell a rat

1761
01:25:10,797 --> 01:25:12,127
Something is amiss

1762
01:25:13,431 --> 01:25:15,557
You were busy with
your father's illness

1763
01:25:15,830 --> 01:25:18,320
So I appointed an enquiry committee

1764
01:25:19,298 --> 01:25:23,322
That is when I found
a mole in my own family

1765
01:25:24,331 --> 01:25:26,354
I don't understand

1766
01:25:28,131 --> 01:25:29,791
It lacks radiance?

1767
01:25:38,398 --> 01:25:41,365
How much donation money
have you collected this year?

1768
01:25:42,931 --> 01:25:44,159
What are the expenses?

1769
01:25:46,298 --> 01:25:51,026
You were going to arrange for the
jewellery today. I know it's pretty late

1770
01:25:51,998 --> 01:25:53,827
But the stones are fake

1771
01:25:55,765 --> 01:25:56,856
Am I wrong?

1772
01:25:57,965 --> 01:25:59,896
Prasanna you come
from a respected family

1773
01:26:00,797 --> 01:26:02,992
Such deceit is not expected of you

1774
01:26:05,031 --> 01:26:07,293
You pocketed the money for yourself?

1775
01:26:10,431 --> 01:26:12,227
I have done no such thing

1776
01:26:14,897 --> 01:26:17,057
I was going to give it back

1777
01:26:18,231 --> 01:26:21,822
Are you doing this because
I used the donation money?

1778
01:26:25,130 --> 01:26:29,189
I notice that you're taking a
lot of decisions without consulting me

1779
01:26:30,130 --> 01:26:32,961
You are still connected
to the old party

1780
01:26:35,497 --> 01:26:37,361
You attend their rallies, don't you?

1781
01:26:42,197 --> 01:26:44,095
Prasanna, this is politics

1782
01:26:45,064 --> 01:26:47,121
You can't afford to be so emotional

1783
01:26:48,997 --> 01:26:50,259
Listen to me

1784
01:26:50,464 --> 01:26:53,896
You are burdened by your own
responsibilities as a son this year

1785
01:26:55,431 --> 01:26:56,987
Make sure you take care of them

1786
01:26:57,263 --> 01:26:59,889
I don't understand, please be specific

1787
01:26:59,964 --> 01:27:02,896
If you stay within the party,
some day you may understand

1788
01:27:05,097 --> 01:27:08,688
As of now, let Sai handle
all the responsibilities

1789
01:27:29,864 --> 01:27:32,229
Zantye has no sense.
Talks rubbish

1790
01:27:33,197 --> 01:27:38,130
You have promised to give
him the money that you took

1791
01:27:38,197 --> 01:27:40,958
What about all the effort
we took to collect the money?

1792
01:27:41,397 --> 01:27:42,761
HEY

1793
01:27:42,830 --> 01:27:48,786
Even if I become the president, for
me you will always be the president

1794
01:27:49,031 --> 01:27:54,986
You know what? It's all in the family

1795
01:27:55,763 --> 01:28:02,595
Use this tension in the right way,
for Uncle Gaju

1796
01:28:20,797 --> 01:28:21,694
Hey bro

1797
01:28:23,664 --> 01:28:24,789
What about the money?

1798
01:28:25,897 --> 01:28:30,796
I would have lent it to you, but...

1799
01:28:31,096 --> 01:28:33,687
I have to account for it

1800
01:28:54,030 --> 01:28:56,019
Sir, Dr. Shroff is ready

1801
01:28:56,096 --> 01:28:57,290
He is expecting you

1802
01:28:57,597 --> 01:28:58,256
OK

1803
01:28:59,562 --> 01:29:00,722
Thank you

1804
01:29:11,562 --> 01:29:12,960
Excuse me, Dr. Shroff?

1805
01:29:14,163 --> 01:29:15,061
Come in, come in

1806
01:29:15,596 --> 01:29:16,756
Raja Kamerkar

1807
01:29:17,529 --> 01:29:19,155
RK, I'm sorry

1808
01:29:19,230 --> 01:29:20,662
I didn't recognize you
- How are you?

1809
01:29:20,729 --> 01:29:21,695
Nice to meet you
- Hi

1810
01:29:21,763 --> 01:29:22,991
This is Ashwin, my cousin

1811
01:29:23,063 --> 01:29:23,893
Hi Ashwin

1812
01:29:23,963 --> 01:29:25,520
Please sit

1813
01:29:26,930 --> 01:29:27,896
Tea, Ashwin?

1814
01:29:30,796 --> 01:29:31,956
They are my relatives

1815
01:29:32,030 --> 01:29:33,155
It's OK. Let them be

1816
01:29:34,263 --> 01:29:34,956
Come in

1817
01:29:35,030 --> 01:29:35,860
Let them come in, no problem

1818
01:29:35,929 --> 01:29:36,862
Please come in

1819
01:29:36,930 --> 01:29:37,794
Come in

1820
01:29:38,063 --> 01:29:39,961
Come in

1821
01:29:40,030 --> 01:29:41,257
Tatya, here

1822
01:29:41,829 --> 01:29:42,795
Come on

1823
01:29:42,996 --> 01:29:44,156
Come, sit here

1824
01:29:44,230 --> 01:29:46,719
Don't make him sit there, you fool

1825
01:29:47,596 --> 01:29:48,790
Come in

1826
01:29:49,163 --> 01:29:50,959
Wait, I'll get a chair

1827
01:29:51,130 --> 01:29:52,289
Please come on in

1828
01:29:57,296 --> 01:29:58,592
Come on in

1829
01:30:00,596 --> 01:30:01,790
Move aside

1830
01:30:11,529 --> 01:30:14,052
I suppose the patient is a good man

1831
01:30:15,262 --> 01:30:19,525
It's so heart-warming to see the whole
family coming together in support

1832
01:30:19,596 --> 01:30:20,790
I am really impressed

1833
01:30:20,963 --> 01:30:22,020
It's rare

1834
01:30:22,996 --> 01:30:24,189
Where is his son?

1835
01:30:25,529 --> 01:30:26,222
He'll be here in awhile

1836
01:30:26,296 --> 01:30:27,262
OK

1837
01:30:27,996 --> 01:30:29,189
Can I speak in Marathi?

1838
01:30:29,262 --> 01:30:30,751
Yes!

1839
01:30:30,829 --> 01:30:31,852
Otherwise we won't
know what you're saying

1840
01:30:31,930 --> 01:30:32,794
I am a Dadar boy

1841
01:30:32,863 --> 01:30:34,226
I can try

1842
01:30:34,296 --> 01:30:35,955
Please forgive my mistakes

1843
01:30:36,896 --> 01:30:38,090
So Prasanna, right?

1844
01:30:38,262 --> 01:30:41,922
He asked me to put
his father on the ventilator

1845
01:30:42,195 --> 01:30:43,753
I said OK, fine

1846
01:30:43,829 --> 01:30:45,090
But give me a reason

1847
01:30:45,762 --> 01:30:49,991
He said if something
happens to Father...

1848
01:30:51,629 --> 01:30:54,028
then he will be in a fix

1849
01:30:54,562 --> 01:30:55,721
This is what he told me

1850
01:30:56,162 --> 01:30:57,492
I don't know why he said that

1851
01:30:57,895 --> 01:31:04,090
So I asked him to think about
it and take the right decision

1852
01:31:04,796 --> 01:31:08,729
Because once I connect the
ventilator I cannot pull it off

1853
01:31:08,796 --> 01:31:10,023
That is illegal

1854
01:31:10,095 --> 01:31:11,686
You give it to me in writing

1855
01:31:11,762 --> 01:31:14,627
I will take him off the
ventilator and discharge him

1856
01:31:15,029 --> 01:31:15,962
And then...

1857
01:31:16,628 --> 01:31:17,856
whatever happens to...

1858
01:31:19,562 --> 01:31:20,722
him, will happen

1859
01:31:20,796 --> 01:31:22,761
But why did he take such a decision?

1860
01:31:22,828 --> 01:31:23,817
No

1861
01:31:23,895 --> 01:31:25,658
We took this decision together

1862
01:31:26,095 --> 01:31:30,619
I said how could Father
be in the ICU during Ganpati?

1863
01:31:30,696 --> 01:31:34,992
He said Father will recover faster
if we put him on the ventilator

1864
01:31:35,195 --> 01:31:37,161
- Am I right, Doctor?
- No, no

1865
01:31:37,628 --> 01:31:39,617
No, no Sarika

1866
01:31:40,529 --> 01:31:43,018
The ventilator is not a medicine

1867
01:31:43,094 --> 01:31:44,220
Let me make it very clear

1868
01:31:44,695 --> 01:31:47,094
It just keeps the patient alive

1869
01:31:47,162 --> 01:31:48,059
That's it

1870
01:31:49,194 --> 01:31:51,457
RK, should I explain?

1871
01:31:51,728 --> 01:31:55,683
May I have your permission?
Please, everybody, pay attention

1872
01:31:56,595 --> 01:31:58,618
Tell me, where is your heart?

1873
01:32:03,861 --> 01:32:05,760
Good. Here

1874
01:32:06,129 --> 01:32:09,527
Now tell me, where are your kidneys?

1875
01:32:13,529 --> 01:32:16,620
No, not there. They're here

1876
01:32:17,129 --> 01:32:17,890
That's nice

1877
01:32:17,962 --> 01:32:19,053
Where is your liver?

1878
01:32:20,961 --> 01:32:22,689
Liver's there

1879
01:32:23,895 --> 01:32:25,917
These are vital organs

1880
01:32:27,061 --> 01:32:33,086
The good news is Father's vital
organs are in excellent shape

1881
01:32:33,595 --> 01:32:35,084
Now let's move on to the head

1882
01:32:35,794 --> 01:32:38,693
Your brain has two pans

1883
01:32:38,762 --> 01:32:40,854
A big one and a small one

1884
01:32:41,961 --> 01:32:46,985
The small one controIs
all the vital organs

1885
01:32:47,662 --> 01:32:49,651
This small brain is damaged

1886
01:32:51,560 --> 01:32:54,391
In my medical experience, I tell you...

1887
01:32:55,828 --> 01:32:57,919
this cannot be cured

1888
01:32:58,994 --> 01:32:59,756
You mean...

1889
01:33:02,560 --> 01:33:04,027
the chances of my father living...

1890
01:33:05,962 --> 01:33:09,360
are zero?

1891
01:33:09,762 --> 01:33:10,990
I won't say zero

1892
01:33:12,894 --> 01:33:14,383
I'll give him one per cent

1893
01:33:14,461 --> 01:33:15,450
One per cent?

1894
01:33:16,395 --> 01:33:17,486
On what basis?

1895
01:33:17,561 --> 01:33:21,357
Sir, I can't say this
within the walIs of this hospital

1896
01:33:21,795 --> 01:33:23,556
But God can work His miracles

1897
01:33:23,627 --> 01:33:25,458
That means miracles can happen

1898
01:33:26,929 --> 01:33:29,895
I have complete faith in God.
Complete

1899
01:33:30,861 --> 01:33:34,089
We should continue keeping
him on the ventilator, shouldn't we?

1900
01:33:34,527 --> 01:33:37,426
Sarika, we can't do that indefinitely

1901
01:33:37,495 --> 01:33:38,655
That's I want to say

1902
01:33:38,728 --> 01:33:40,023
Take a clear stand

1903
01:33:40,527 --> 01:33:43,517
Don't keep everyone's
Ganpati on the ventilator too

1904
01:33:44,095 --> 01:33:46,753
But shouldn't the son
be here to take this call?

1905
01:33:46,961 --> 01:33:48,621
He is absconding at the
time of this crucial discussion

1906
01:33:48,695 --> 01:33:49,820
I'll take that call

1907
01:33:49,928 --> 01:33:50,917
I'm his daughter

1908
01:33:51,328 --> 01:33:52,419
No, sorry

1909
01:33:52,861 --> 01:33:54,624
Women cannot take this decision

1910
01:33:54,695 --> 01:33:56,820
No, excuse me, did I hear right?

1911
01:33:57,594 --> 01:33:59,527
You know Doctor,
we have our own customs...

1912
01:33:59,595 --> 01:34:01,686
on the responsibilities
of men and women

1913
01:34:01,761 --> 01:34:03,353
Can you hear what you are saying?

1914
01:34:05,628 --> 01:34:08,492
I think Bhau's logic
is absolutely right

1915
01:34:08,794 --> 01:34:10,852
We may have to sacrifice
the first few days of the festival

1916
01:34:10,929 --> 01:34:13,656
But we can bring
Ganpati home after Gauri

1917
01:34:14,295 --> 01:34:18,659
Depending on the
ventilator won't help us

1918
01:34:19,028 --> 01:34:22,551
AIso, Lata is coming down
with Pat for the first time

1919
01:34:22,894 --> 01:34:24,553
Shouldn't they be able
to experience our festival?

1920
01:34:24,627 --> 01:34:30,617
Yes, Lata and I were going
to celebrate Hartalika together

1921
01:34:30,694 --> 01:34:32,683
Just once second, who is this Lata?

1922
01:34:32,761 --> 01:34:34,557
She is our cousin sister

1923
01:34:34,627 --> 01:34:35,287
She is not here?

1924
01:34:35,361 --> 01:34:37,259
No, she is coming from the USA

1925
01:34:37,328 --> 01:34:39,316
Rashmi, don't lose hope

1926
01:34:39,394 --> 01:34:40,724
Why don't you say something?

1927
01:34:40,794 --> 01:34:43,317
I want to go to the toilet

1928
01:34:43,994 --> 01:34:44,721
Daddy

1929
01:34:44,794 --> 01:34:45,692
Toilet?

1930
01:34:46,661 --> 01:34:47,752
- Where is it?
- Where is it?

1931
01:34:47,827 --> 01:34:50,021
Down the corridor,
on the left hand side

1932
01:34:52,761 --> 01:34:54,352
Daddy, you stay right outside

1933
01:34:56,727 --> 01:34:58,592
How will I know whether
the coin has come out?

1934
01:34:58,662 --> 01:35:03,617
In that case I should have the
honour of the Gauri saree this year

1935
01:35:03,694 --> 01:35:04,921
What do you mean?

1936
01:35:05,193 --> 01:35:06,785
You had it last year, didn't you?

1937
01:35:06,861 --> 01:35:08,259
How greedy!

1938
01:35:08,328 --> 01:35:10,419
You just want everything
to go your way all the time

1939
01:35:10,527 --> 01:35:11,960
How dare you call me greedy?

1940
01:35:15,594 --> 01:35:17,526
Who are Gauri and Hartalika?

1941
01:35:17,694 --> 01:35:18,854
They are Goddesses

1942
01:35:18,928 --> 01:35:20,360
They come with Ganpati

1943
01:35:20,427 --> 01:35:21,450
Can't they come together?

1944
01:35:21,661 --> 01:35:23,627
Don't you see what happens
when two women are...

1945
01:35:23,694 --> 01:35:25,887
in the same room at the same time?

1946
01:35:25,960 --> 01:35:28,586
Even God can't take that risk

1947
01:35:29,761 --> 01:35:32,193
Should I bring up
the toilet issue now?

1948
01:35:37,794 --> 01:35:39,226
Excuse me

1949
01:35:39,294 --> 01:35:40,920
Excuse me

1950
01:35:41,493 --> 01:35:42,857
I want to tell you all one thing

1951
01:35:43,560 --> 01:35:46,457
Don't worry about God

1952
01:35:46,793 --> 01:35:48,783
He can take care of Himself

1953
01:35:50,761 --> 01:35:53,749
The person on the ventilator,
worry about him

1954
01:35:53,826 --> 01:35:56,486
Doctor, here's our Prasanna

1955
01:35:56,794 --> 01:35:58,282
That's good

1956
01:35:58,826 --> 01:35:59,883
Come, Prasanna

1957
01:36:00,160 --> 01:36:03,649
Prasanna, where did you go
without telling anyone?

1958
01:36:03,726 --> 01:36:05,557
Don't you know the
gravity of the situation?

1959
01:36:05,694 --> 01:36:07,217
The ventilator

1960
01:36:09,460 --> 01:36:10,654
Switch it off

1961
01:36:16,527 --> 01:36:17,459
Are you sure?

1962
01:36:17,527 --> 01:36:18,686
Please, enough!

1963
01:36:19,459 --> 01:36:20,619
Let him decide

1964
01:36:23,593 --> 01:36:24,219
Yes

1965
01:36:24,293 --> 01:36:25,760
How can you say that?

1966
01:36:26,360 --> 01:36:27,884
You should have spoken to us

1967
01:36:28,394 --> 01:36:29,826
What is wrong with you, Prasanna?

1968
01:36:31,260 --> 01:36:33,386
All of you are concerned
about Ganpati, aren't you?

1969
01:36:34,760 --> 01:36:35,749
Alright

1970
01:36:36,893 --> 01:36:39,518
Let's give my father
a chance till noon tomorrow

1971
01:36:40,526 --> 01:36:42,686
We have already paid
till noon tomorrow

1972
01:36:45,660 --> 01:36:48,355
Please give me time till noon tomorrow

1973
01:36:51,860 --> 01:36:53,452
And give my father...

1974
01:36:55,493 --> 01:36:57,051
one last chance

1975
01:37:26,427 --> 01:37:27,756
Yes, I'll be right there

1976
01:37:27,826 --> 01:37:29,054
Mr. Kamerkar?

1977
01:37:29,126 --> 01:37:30,320
- Yes?
- Hi

1978
01:37:30,726 --> 01:37:33,192
We'll switch the ventilator
off at 12 noon tomorrow

1979
01:37:33,259 --> 01:37:34,726
You need to complete some formalities

1980
01:37:34,793 --> 01:37:36,191
Here are the forms

1981
01:37:36,260 --> 01:37:39,226
AIso, you need to decide
about organ donation

1982
01:37:39,459 --> 01:37:41,516
You may discuss amongst yourselves...

1983
01:37:41,593 --> 01:37:43,355
if you want to donate
any of the patient's organs

1984
01:37:43,426 --> 01:37:47,518
His eyes, liver, skin:
just mark them on this form

1985
01:37:47,660 --> 01:37:49,786
We'll finish other
formalities tomorrow morning

1986
01:37:50,259 --> 01:37:52,158
We'll keep the bill ready by morning

1987
01:37:52,426 --> 01:37:53,755
I'm in a rush, I'll push off

1988
01:37:53,825 --> 01:37:55,314
I'll be at the desk in the morning

1989
01:37:55,526 --> 01:37:56,549
OK
- Thank you

1990
01:37:56,626 --> 01:37:57,615
Thank you
- Thank you

1991
01:38:18,293 --> 01:38:19,316
Prasanna

1992
01:38:21,593 --> 01:38:25,355
Not even God could say
if your decision is right or wrong

1993
01:38:26,659 --> 01:38:29,149
I know it's very difficult
for a child to take...

1994
01:38:29,226 --> 01:38:31,022
this sort of decision
about his parent

1995
01:38:33,359 --> 01:38:37,314
We won't question your decision

1996
01:38:41,592 --> 01:38:45,082
But now you must
go and meet your father

1997
01:38:48,526 --> 01:38:50,288
I've seen him twice or thrice

1998
01:38:50,359 --> 01:38:51,984
No, you've just seen him

1999
01:38:52,292 --> 01:38:53,588
You haven't met him

2000
01:38:56,159 --> 01:38:58,091
You may have some
bones to pick with him

2001
01:39:00,426 --> 01:39:05,416
There're many things that
have been left unsaid

2002
01:39:07,559 --> 01:39:12,082
Many emotions are often left
unexpressed between a father and son

2003
01:39:13,092 --> 01:39:14,922
And the resentment builds up

2004
01:39:19,325 --> 01:39:20,951
He can't speak to you anymore

2005
01:39:21,692 --> 01:39:23,090
But you can

2006
01:39:24,191 --> 01:39:27,318
You have that opportunity
till noon tomorrow

2007
01:39:30,425 --> 01:39:34,017
I have no idea about the
tension between you and Uncle Gaju

2008
01:39:35,325 --> 01:39:40,224
But I know you are determined to prove
yourself and thus prove him wrong

2009
01:39:41,692 --> 01:39:44,284
Prasanna, he is your father

2010
01:39:45,125 --> 01:39:48,058
He has done his best for you

2011
01:39:48,558 --> 01:39:50,923
I'm sure you're doing your best too

2012
01:39:51,358 --> 01:39:52,688
But what do you want to prove now?

2013
01:39:53,458 --> 01:39:55,221
And when will he see it?

2014
01:39:56,992 --> 01:39:58,186
Go and speak to him

2015
01:40:01,392 --> 01:40:07,189
He won't be able to say
anything but let him listen to you

2016
01:40:11,159 --> 01:40:12,181
Go to him

2017
01:40:37,159 --> 01:40:39,488
Ashwin, you go ahead. I'll join you

2018
01:40:40,225 --> 01:40:41,214
OK

2019
01:40:45,492 --> 01:40:46,925
You haven't gone home?

2020
01:40:49,691 --> 01:40:51,385
I'll stay here

2021
01:40:51,692 --> 01:40:53,159
You should go home

2022
01:40:53,293 --> 01:40:55,224
Everyone has, you should too

2023
01:40:55,292 --> 01:40:57,952
I want to spend this
last night with Gaju bhau

2024
01:41:00,258 --> 01:41:03,452
Every night we chatted
outside our homes

2025
01:41:05,292 --> 01:41:07,122
He was my audience

2026
01:41:08,058 --> 01:41:11,184
I would practice my
audition lines with him

2027
01:41:14,059 --> 01:41:17,548
He often said,
with tears in his eyes...

2028
01:41:17,625 --> 01:41:21,148
'Aatma, there's a lot
of struggle in your profession.

2029
01:41:22,858 --> 01:41:25,019
Raja too has struggled a lot

2030
01:41:25,358 --> 01:41:29,916
He's from a small village,
but today he is a successful director

2031
01:41:31,058 --> 01:41:34,184
I'll introduce you to him someday'

2032
01:41:35,425 --> 01:41:37,187
He must be very happy today

2033
01:41:42,224 --> 01:41:43,486
You go

2034
01:41:44,592 --> 01:41:47,990
Prasanna keeps going out all the time

2035
01:41:49,258 --> 01:41:52,622
I'll stay in case there's an emergency

2036
01:41:54,491 --> 01:41:55,821
He won't go anywhere

2037
01:41:57,158 --> 01:41:58,180
I promise

2038
01:42:01,025 --> 01:42:03,150
You must go home now
and come back in the morning

2039
01:42:03,224 --> 01:42:04,089
Shall I drop you home?

2040
01:42:04,158 --> 01:42:05,487
No sir, thanks

2041
01:42:06,358 --> 01:42:07,518
OK

2042
01:42:09,091 --> 01:42:09,955
And yes...

2043
01:42:10,058 --> 01:42:11,183
do give me your number

2044
01:42:11,858 --> 01:42:13,881
I'm sure I'll need it soon

2045
01:42:14,424 --> 01:42:16,414
I have your number

2046
01:42:16,491 --> 01:42:18,481
I'll give you a missed call

2047
01:42:19,024 --> 01:42:20,115
OK

2048
01:42:20,257 --> 01:42:21,485
Goodnight

2049
01:42:32,391 --> 01:42:34,154
OK. Got it

2050
01:42:55,990 --> 01:42:57,320
Raja is here

2051
01:42:59,091 --> 01:43:00,216
Your favourite

2052
01:43:03,925 --> 01:43:06,754
He asked me to speak to you

2053
01:43:08,357 --> 01:43:10,983
He must have lived
with us for about a year

2054
01:43:11,757 --> 01:43:14,952
Raja, Raja, Raja, Raja

2055
01:43:19,190 --> 01:43:20,350
Your favourite, Raja

2056
01:43:23,257 --> 01:43:26,383
I have lived with you for 30
years and 9 months. What am I to you?

2057
01:43:28,257 --> 01:43:30,019
I wonder

2058
01:43:31,025 --> 01:43:34,013
When I was a child you
took me to the butcher...

2059
01:43:36,190 --> 01:43:41,351
and asked him to give me
the brain of the animal

2060
01:43:42,190 --> 01:43:43,952
He needs to grow smart, you would say

2061
01:43:46,791 --> 01:43:48,154
I used to get furious

2062
01:43:49,024 --> 01:43:51,184
I was very young but I knew
what you were trying to do

2063
01:43:51,857 --> 01:43:54,052
When I was in Grade B,
you bought a new scooter

2064
01:43:54,124 --> 01:43:57,147
I was sitting on the new
scooter but you lifted me off

2065
01:43:58,224 --> 01:44:00,122
You made Sarika sit on
it because she is lucky for you

2066
01:44:00,190 --> 01:44:01,849
She is lucky. So
am I unlucky for you?

2067
01:44:04,924 --> 01:44:07,254
You never noticed how
good I was at other things

2068
01:44:10,025 --> 01:44:11,717
We didn't have water
supply in the building

2069
01:44:13,257 --> 01:44:15,246
I was the one who got us
24-hour water supply

2070
01:44:18,990 --> 01:44:21,854
I used to score less
than Sarika in the exams...

2071
01:44:21,924 --> 01:44:26,413
so I would forge
your signature on my report cards

2072
01:44:26,690 --> 01:44:27,781
Should I sign these?

2073
01:44:30,157 --> 01:44:35,647
They are asking me which
organs are to be donated

2074
01:44:35,724 --> 01:44:38,156
Liver, kidney, skin, eyes

2075
01:44:40,157 --> 01:44:42,179
I'll sign these and
give away all the organs

2076
01:44:45,324 --> 01:44:47,187
It's become a big social issue

2077
01:44:49,823 --> 01:44:53,653
You've promised people
land and mangoes

2078
01:44:53,690 --> 01:44:55,316
They have come here
to claim their share

2079
01:44:58,590 --> 01:45:02,114
You spoke about me to everybody.
Why didn't you ever talk to me?

2080
01:45:04,723 --> 01:45:06,621
Mr. Gajanan Kamerkar

2081
01:45:08,356 --> 01:45:10,083
Get up and talk to me

2082
01:45:11,623 --> 01:45:14,112
You have only till noon tomorrow

2083
01:45:15,089 --> 01:45:16,886
No one can help you after that

2084
01:45:18,624 --> 01:45:21,112
I have already resolved
your political issue

2085
01:45:23,723 --> 01:45:25,655
I have quit politics

2086
01:47:39,223 --> 01:47:40,746
Good morning, brother

2087
01:47:41,889 --> 01:47:43,082
Tea

2088
01:47:48,155 --> 01:47:49,918
May I sit here for a moment?

2089
01:47:50,956 --> 01:47:52,013
Sure

2090
01:47:58,822 --> 01:48:00,151
Is your father in the ICU?

2091
01:48:01,056 --> 01:48:03,045
Yes, my father

2092
01:48:04,389 --> 01:48:05,822
It's all happening at the wrong time

2093
01:48:07,123 --> 01:48:08,487
Very sorry for you

2094
01:48:09,022 --> 01:48:11,785
Is your father admitted here too?

2095
01:48:12,756 --> 01:48:14,688
Not at all

2096
01:48:15,055 --> 01:48:16,852
My father is fine

2097
01:48:20,689 --> 01:48:21,587
Brother...

2098
01:48:25,955 --> 01:48:27,581
don't you worry

2099
01:48:27,656 --> 01:48:30,678
I'll help you in any way you need

2100
01:48:33,088 --> 01:48:36,146
What are you trying to say? Help?

2101
01:48:36,422 --> 01:48:37,820
Let me explain

2102
01:48:39,555 --> 01:48:43,010
One is emotionally charged
in a situation like this

2103
01:48:43,889 --> 01:48:46,378
We tend to overlook trivial matters

2104
01:48:46,621 --> 01:48:50,816
Things like the pot, the red cloth

2105
01:48:51,554 --> 01:48:54,852
You'll aIso need the bier

2106
01:48:55,489 --> 01:48:58,421
You need to write to your relatives
about the funeral rites...

2107
01:48:58,489 --> 01:49:00,922
immersion of the
remains at Benares, Haridwar

2108
01:49:00,989 --> 01:49:02,977
We have a special package
for these arrangements

2109
01:49:03,355 --> 01:49:05,754
We arrange for every detail

2110
01:49:05,822 --> 01:49:09,516
A unique,
essential and personal service

2111
01:49:09,922 --> 01:49:12,354
RIP funeral rituaIs services

2112
01:49:12,821 --> 01:49:14,447
It is going to happen at noon, right?

2113
01:49:15,088 --> 01:49:17,520
It will be 2 pm by the time
they hand over the body to you

2114
01:49:17,721 --> 01:49:20,586
One doesn't know how long it will take
after the ventilator is turned off

2115
01:49:21,956 --> 01:49:23,682
I will arrange for everything

2116
01:49:23,755 --> 01:49:26,051
You don't have to worry about a thing

2117
01:49:29,955 --> 01:49:31,615
Do you have a crow?

2118
01:49:32,522 --> 01:49:33,352
A crow?

2119
01:49:34,454 --> 01:49:37,854
After death, on the 13th day,
there's a crow ritual

2120
01:49:39,955 --> 01:49:45,615
If a crow accepts food from us, we believe
that the soul is free of all bonds

2121
01:49:47,755 --> 01:49:49,619
I'm sure you have
a crow in your package

2122
01:49:50,922 --> 01:49:52,615
I understand your emotions

2123
01:49:52,788 --> 01:49:54,982
That is exactly how I would
react if I were in your shoes

2124
01:49:55,554 --> 01:49:56,645
You're hurt

2125
01:49:57,088 --> 01:49:59,487
Never mind. Please keep my card

2126
01:50:01,821 --> 01:50:02,685
May God bless you

2127
01:50:10,055 --> 01:50:11,782
Yes, this is for you

2128
01:50:11,922 --> 01:50:14,412
Be careful, it's hot

2129
01:50:14,489 --> 01:50:15,455
Good morning

2130
01:50:15,522 --> 01:50:17,613
Good morning
- Pritam, have you had breakfast?

2131
01:50:17,688 --> 01:50:18,449
Yes

2132
01:50:18,554 --> 01:50:20,544
Tatya, did you sleep well?

2133
01:50:20,622 --> 01:50:21,916
Yes

2134
01:50:22,488 --> 01:50:24,750
Your house is beautiful

2135
01:50:24,988 --> 01:50:26,079
Hurry UP

2136
01:50:26,355 --> 01:50:27,047
Get ready

2137
01:50:27,321 --> 01:50:28,754
I just have to wear my pants

2138
01:50:28,855 --> 01:50:29,787
Shall we leave right away?

2139
01:50:29,855 --> 01:50:31,049
I'll go ahead with Ashwin

2140
01:50:31,322 --> 01:50:32,754
You get ready and join us

2141
01:50:37,854 --> 01:50:40,549
Hurry up Tatya,
we have to go to the hospital

2142
01:50:40,621 --> 01:50:43,349
Careful, you'll burn your tongue

2143
01:50:43,421 --> 01:50:44,444
Sir

2144
01:50:45,888 --> 01:50:48,445
Bhau left for the hospital
early in the morning

2145
01:50:48,588 --> 01:50:51,078
He came home early yesterday
and went to bed without having dinner

2146
01:50:57,388 --> 01:50:58,513
Here

2147
01:51:08,921 --> 01:51:11,684
At 12 noon, after it's taken off
the ventilator, we'll discharge the body...

2148
01:51:11,755 --> 01:51:13,380
and we'll shift
the body to the ward

2149
01:51:13,788 --> 01:51:16,015
Gajanan Kamerkar

2150
01:51:18,354 --> 01:51:19,751
Organ donation form?

2151
01:51:23,521 --> 01:51:25,283
Organ donation form?

2152
01:51:32,288 --> 01:51:34,277
You haven't marked any organs

2153
01:51:34,421 --> 01:51:37,353
If the organs are healthy,
they may save lives

2154
01:51:37,421 --> 01:51:39,979
Sometimes,
12 lives are saved by 1 body

2155
01:51:40,254 --> 01:51:42,777
In this case,
all the organs are intact

2156
01:51:44,021 --> 01:51:49,284
Please consider it since we don't
have much time once the body is dead

2157
01:52:01,254 --> 01:52:01,947
Sir?

2158
01:52:02,453 --> 01:52:03,352
Sir!

2159
01:52:04,354 --> 01:52:05,787
You need to sign as the witness

2160
01:52:13,387 --> 01:52:17,218
Is there any surgery
to change the brain?

2161
01:52:17,288 --> 01:52:18,720
Brain transplant?

2162
01:52:18,787 --> 01:52:21,845
No, not yet.
It's extremely complicated

2163
01:52:22,388 --> 01:52:23,285
Next

2164
01:52:23,353 --> 01:52:26,377
So, did the coin come out?

2165
01:52:26,620 --> 01:52:28,246
You have your machine

2166
01:52:28,387 --> 01:52:30,353
Why don't you run it
over him and see if it beeps?

2167
01:52:30,553 --> 01:52:32,543
Did I interrogate you about
what you had for breakfast?

2168
01:52:33,687 --> 01:52:34,619
Come on

2169
01:52:54,853 --> 01:52:56,411
Did you sleep well?

2170
01:52:56,487 --> 01:52:58,181
There's our coin

2171
01:52:58,254 --> 01:52:59,152
Is the coin out?

2172
01:52:59,221 --> 01:53:00,186
We are here to find out

2173
01:53:00,253 --> 01:53:02,447
Did it make a sound in the morning?

2174
01:53:03,187 --> 01:53:04,381
Daddy

2175
01:53:04,820 --> 01:53:06,411
So finally where will they
take the body?

2176
01:53:06,487 --> 01:53:07,544
Home or straight to the crematorium?

2177
01:53:07,620 --> 01:53:10,485
It's not practical to take it home
and then to the crematorium

2178
01:53:10,654 --> 01:53:12,279
People will have to hop
from one place to the other

2179
01:53:12,353 --> 01:53:15,843
It should be wrapped up quickly
so that everyone can get back to work

2180
01:53:16,120 --> 01:53:18,177
Don't bother telling him,
he is busy with his son

2181
01:53:18,253 --> 01:53:19,583
Go get it checked

2182
01:53:19,654 --> 01:53:22,484
Make sure you show
us the x-ray before 12 noon

2183
01:53:52,654 --> 01:53:53,585
Pat

2184
01:53:53,653 --> 01:53:55,381
Pat

2185
01:53:55,453 --> 01:53:58,749
You've grown so tall and so sweet

2186
01:53:59,753 --> 01:54:00,618
My dearest

2187
01:54:00,687 --> 01:54:02,483
Look at Lata's husband,
he's a divorcee

2188
01:54:02,553 --> 01:54:03,644
This is his second marriage

2189
01:54:03,719 --> 01:54:04,810
Really?

2190
01:54:05,086 --> 01:54:06,211
It's OK in the USA

2191
01:54:06,287 --> 01:54:08,253
<i>Hey Patty</i>

2192
01:54:11,387 --> 01:54:12,581
Everyone will rush to them

2193
01:54:17,053 --> 01:54:19,644
Pritam will flaunt
his amazing 'English'

2194
01:54:19,719 --> 01:54:23,084
Pritam
- You've grown, you're bigger

2195
01:54:27,120 --> 01:54:32,814
In the well... swim... strong...
powerful... hospital... Come

2196
01:54:39,587 --> 01:54:40,644
Prasanna

2197
01:54:42,253 --> 01:54:44,242
This is one of
our old family albums

2198
01:54:44,787 --> 01:54:47,219
There are some photos
of Uncle Gaju in there

2199
01:54:47,286 --> 01:54:48,582
You will need this later

2200
01:54:48,819 --> 01:54:50,115
When you need a photo to frame

2201
01:54:50,620 --> 01:54:52,052
Bhau, Lata is here

2202
01:54:52,719 --> 01:54:54,345
We'll be downstairs

2203
01:54:58,619 --> 01:55:00,143
Haven't you two made up yet?

2204
01:55:01,253 --> 01:55:03,049
I was about to take him some tea

2205
01:55:03,552 --> 01:55:05,576
But he had already left,
without telling anyone

2206
01:55:05,686 --> 01:55:08,414
These are old habits.
Won't change so soon

2207
01:55:08,686 --> 01:55:10,449
You're going to donate
the organs, aren't you?

2208
01:55:11,053 --> 01:55:13,109
The body will be
transferred to the mortuary

2209
01:55:16,653 --> 01:55:18,483
Gajanan Kamerkar

2210
01:55:20,220 --> 01:55:22,243
You still haven't
signed the consent form

2211
01:55:23,419 --> 01:55:25,011
Sign here

2212
01:55:53,452 --> 01:55:55,111
Are you ready for magic?

2213
01:55:55,185 --> 01:55:56,947
Yes

2214
01:55:58,552 --> 01:56:00,212
Wow

2215
01:56:03,486 --> 01:56:05,645
That is our entire family

2216
01:56:08,052 --> 01:56:09,450
That is such an old picture of mine

2217
01:56:09,519 --> 01:56:12,349
Be grateful you have hair in it

2218
01:56:12,619 --> 01:56:14,017
Family tree! That's wonderful

2219
01:56:14,085 --> 01:56:17,450
There's the tree.
Can you find Ajit's mangoes on it?

2220
01:56:18,352 --> 01:56:21,682
It's just like the tree in our fields

2221
01:56:21,952 --> 01:56:25,317
Has he understood a word
of what you're saying?

2222
01:56:25,386 --> 01:56:27,079
I am sure he understands Marathi

2223
01:56:27,219 --> 01:56:29,584
Pat-rao, you understand Marathi?

2224
01:56:30,986 --> 01:56:32,315
Just a little

2225
01:56:33,252 --> 01:56:35,981
My little Pat, come to your Grandma

2226
01:56:36,053 --> 01:56:37,984
<i>Come to me, sweetheart</i>

2227
01:56:38,052 --> 01:56:40,280
Sit with me, sit with Grandma

2228
01:56:42,219 --> 01:56:46,550
Look how this little one,
who lives in the USA...

2229
01:56:47,452 --> 01:56:50,350
has brought our family together

2230
01:56:50,653 --> 01:56:55,051
We live here but we
rarely meet each other

2231
01:56:56,219 --> 01:56:58,050
Only at weddings...

2232
01:56:59,052 --> 01:57:00,848
and funeraIs

2233
01:57:02,419 --> 01:57:04,384
Why do we do that?

2234
01:57:24,920 --> 01:57:25,441
Give it to me

2235
01:57:26,251 --> 01:57:27,047
I'll take care of it

2236
01:57:27,119 --> 01:57:28,347
Needs to be finely trimmed

2237
01:57:28,419 --> 01:57:29,510
I'll call you back

2238
01:57:58,051 --> 01:58:00,450
It's out

2239
01:58:00,518 --> 01:58:01,916
X-ray clear

2240
01:58:03,551 --> 01:58:04,984
Show me

2241
01:58:05,052 --> 01:58:06,075
Good

2242
01:58:06,152 --> 01:58:08,083
How many bananas you must've eaten

2243
01:58:08,151 --> 01:58:09,777
Enough of your magic tricks now

2244
01:58:10,985 --> 01:58:12,008
The coin is gone?

2245
01:58:12,085 --> 01:58:13,016
Yes

2246
01:58:18,119 --> 01:58:19,448
Just a minute

2247
01:58:20,118 --> 01:58:22,279
I need to speak to all of you

2248
01:58:22,451 --> 01:58:24,315
Have you changed the decision?

2249
01:58:25,184 --> 01:58:28,049
Uncle, don't worry about this decision

2250
01:58:28,552 --> 01:58:30,540
There are several other
things to worry about

2251
01:58:32,185 --> 01:58:34,378
This is the hospital bill

2252
01:58:34,984 --> 01:58:36,815
One lakh seventy five thousand rupees

2253
01:58:41,518 --> 01:58:44,110
Dada, let me handle that

2254
01:58:44,286 --> 01:58:45,149
Hang on

2255
01:58:45,784 --> 01:58:47,444
Just wait and watch

2256
01:58:47,518 --> 01:58:48,780
How could it be so much?

2257
01:58:48,952 --> 01:58:52,009
Is this a hospital or a luxury hotel?

2258
01:58:54,251 --> 01:58:55,978
Prasanna won't be
able to pay this bill

2259
01:58:56,051 --> 01:58:57,040
You want us to pay it?

2260
01:58:57,951 --> 01:59:00,146
He should've thought about
it before admitting him here

2261
01:59:00,185 --> 01:59:02,116
True. How can we afford to pay it?

2262
01:59:02,151 --> 01:59:03,811
This is for Uncle Gaju

2263
01:59:03,885 --> 01:59:06,475
Think of all that he has done for us

2264
01:59:06,751 --> 01:59:09,275
We do not have so much money to spare

2265
01:59:09,952 --> 01:59:12,008
Mumbai is an expensive city to live in

2266
01:59:12,418 --> 01:59:16,873
Even if we go back to the village,
how do we earn a living?

2267
01:59:16,951 --> 01:59:22,112
You must try living in
the village. It's a tough life

2268
01:59:22,184 --> 01:59:26,117
Try putting yourself
in a woman's position

2269
01:59:26,184 --> 01:59:27,150
She is absolutely right

2270
01:59:27,218 --> 01:59:29,241
How do you think we
can afford to pay this bill?

2271
01:59:29,318 --> 01:59:32,875
I don't even have a room of my own
back there. I'm still fighting for it

2272
01:59:32,951 --> 01:59:33,712
Exactly!

2273
01:59:33,784 --> 01:59:35,444
That is exactly why we
were all going to have...

2274
01:59:35,718 --> 01:59:38,479
a meeting in the village.
To sort these issues

2275
01:59:38,751 --> 01:59:40,479
Let's sort them right here

2276
01:59:41,084 --> 01:59:43,243
We still have a half hour
till the ventilator is switched off

2277
01:59:43,717 --> 01:59:46,275
Let's put an end to it right here

2278
01:59:46,818 --> 01:59:48,408
Consider this your big meeting

2279
01:59:48,918 --> 01:59:51,907
How can we resolve
this in half an hour?

2280
01:59:51,984 --> 01:59:53,746
It will be a long discussion

2281
01:59:54,250 --> 01:59:56,445
These problems are
age-old and complicated

2282
01:59:56,784 --> 01:59:58,376
Let's begin with the small ones

2283
02:00:07,218 --> 02:00:08,843
My problem is an important one

2284
02:00:09,084 --> 02:00:11,050
No record has been kept of
the mangoes for the past 20 years

2285
02:00:11,284 --> 02:00:13,115
Rajan and Pritam eat all the mangoes

2286
02:00:13,184 --> 02:00:14,309
They do, yes

2287
02:00:14,385 --> 02:00:15,908
Hang on

2288
02:00:15,984 --> 02:00:17,950
I haven't said anything
about this matter so far

2289
02:00:18,218 --> 02:00:19,843
But let me set the record straight

2290
02:00:19,918 --> 02:00:21,350
Yes, please do

2291
02:00:23,385 --> 02:00:26,783
Who takes care of the trees?

2292
02:00:27,417 --> 02:00:29,975
Who removes the
bee-hives from the trees?

2293
02:00:30,218 --> 02:00:32,048
It is the same with the house

2294
02:00:32,117 --> 02:00:33,845
You come and stay for a couple
of days, like you're on vacation

2295
02:00:33,918 --> 02:00:35,180
Do you think it's a holiday-home?

2296
02:00:35,451 --> 02:00:37,439
It's our ancestral home

2297
02:00:38,918 --> 02:00:40,782
And there's Tatya

2298
02:00:41,118 --> 02:00:42,481
He has no children

2299
02:00:43,051 --> 02:00:44,108
Who takes care of him?

2300
02:00:44,184 --> 02:00:46,276
Just tell me what
the maintenance cost is

2301
02:00:46,351 --> 02:00:48,180
Is Tatya a motor pump
that needs maintenance?

2302
02:00:48,250 --> 02:00:49,444
Do humans need maintenance?

2303
02:00:50,018 --> 02:00:51,212
Why drag Tatya into this?

2304
02:00:51,285 --> 02:00:52,341
Drag Tatya2?

2305
02:00:52,417 --> 02:00:53,679
How dare you?

2306
02:00:55,851 --> 02:00:57,079
May I say something?

2307
02:00:57,151 --> 02:00:58,014
Please do

2308
02:00:58,350 --> 02:01:00,282
Should I ask for my mother's share?

2309
02:01:00,350 --> 02:01:03,749
Have I ever asked for
a part of the ancestral home?

2310
02:01:03,817 --> 02:01:05,146
Why don't you?

2311
02:01:05,217 --> 02:01:06,911
You might as well

2312
02:01:12,851 --> 02:01:14,248
Are they fighting, Dad?

2313
02:01:14,684 --> 02:01:15,309
No, darling

2314
02:01:15,384 --> 02:01:16,714
They're just talking

2315
02:01:16,784 --> 02:01:18,376
That's how Indian families talk

2316
02:01:19,284 --> 02:01:21,876
They stick together
despite their differences

2317
02:01:21,951 --> 02:01:24,417
That's the beauty of the Indian family

2318
02:01:25,117 --> 02:01:28,107
Well, I don't get it

2319
02:01:30,117 --> 02:01:32,675
What topic is this?
What about the mangoes?

2320
02:01:42,984 --> 02:01:44,279
I'll come in a minute

2321
02:01:53,918 --> 02:01:54,782
Hi

2322
02:01:54,851 --> 02:01:56,010
My name is Pat

2323
02:01:58,150 --> 02:01:59,310
Nice to meet you

2324
02:02:00,816 --> 02:02:02,249
My name is Prasanna

2325
02:02:03,850 --> 02:02:05,180
Nice to meet you too

2326
02:02:06,018 --> 02:02:06,949
Come, sit

2327
02:02:12,317 --> 02:02:14,147
Where are you on this chart?

2328
02:02:17,183 --> 02:02:18,343
This is me

2329
02:02:22,017 --> 02:02:23,346
You look different

2330
02:02:26,884 --> 02:02:27,849
That's your mum

2331
02:02:30,183 --> 02:02:31,707
But where's your dad?

2332
02:02:31,884 --> 02:02:32,849
Is he here?

2333
02:02:33,182 --> 02:02:34,274
Is he fighting too?

2334
02:02:34,349 --> 02:02:35,180
No

2335
02:02:36,684 --> 02:02:38,775
He doesn't know how to fight

2336
02:02:40,083 --> 02:02:41,277
He's a good man

2337
02:02:42,917 --> 02:02:46,043
That's what people say of him

2338
02:02:47,217 --> 02:02:48,580
Then where is he?

2339
02:02:50,583 --> 02:02:51,811
He's unwell

2340
02:02:52,017 --> 02:02:54,210
He's upstairs

2341
02:02:54,283 --> 02:02:56,046
He's on the ventilator

2342
02:02:57,017 --> 02:02:58,108
So sorry

2343
02:02:58,183 --> 02:02:59,671
Are you feeling sad?

2344
02:03:01,716 --> 02:03:03,080
Sad?

2345
02:03:06,750 --> 02:03:10,546
I don't know, actually

2346
02:03:57,117 --> 02:03:58,514
You want to see my father?

2347
02:03:58,583 --> 02:03:59,515
Yes, yes

2348
02:04:04,116 --> 02:04:08,981
See? This is my father

2349
02:04:09,449 --> 02:04:10,506
Isn't he handsome?

2350
02:04:13,649 --> 02:04:15,810
This is my sister.

2351
02:04:16,483 --> 02:04:17,711
This is her cycle...

2352
02:04:17,783 --> 02:04:18,942
but it's my favourite cycle

2353
02:04:21,149 --> 02:04:26,446
My sister is on the cycle and my
father is teaching her how to ride it

2354
02:04:27,483 --> 02:04:28,677
I am standing behind them

2355
02:04:31,916 --> 02:04:35,473
My sister and Father,
Father and my sister

2356
02:04:36,449 --> 02:04:39,575
All these photos,
they are all mostly my sister's

2357
02:04:41,149 --> 02:04:45,014
She was lucky for my father

2358
02:04:45,649 --> 02:04:46,945
I understand

2359
02:04:48,850 --> 02:04:50,111
I was...

2360
02:04:53,449 --> 02:04:55,381
I was OK with my mother

2361
02:05:01,949 --> 02:05:04,143
My father and I were
'katti' with each other

2362
02:05:04,616 --> 02:05:05,810
We still are

2363
02:05:08,149 --> 02:05:09,138
You know 'katti'?

2364
02:05:09,715 --> 02:05:10,807
No

2365
02:05:11,849 --> 02:05:13,043
It's...

2366
02:05:14,516 --> 02:05:16,073
it's a small fight

2367
02:05:19,548 --> 02:05:25,448
Goes on for a few days,
months, years

2368
02:05:26,849 --> 02:05:27,906
It's still going on

2369
02:05:29,882 --> 02:05:35,043
Uncle, don't you have
a baby photo of yourself?

2370
02:05:37,650 --> 02:05:39,672
No, I don't have a photo
of me when I was a baby

2371
02:05:39,749 --> 02:05:40,772
Maybe...

2372
02:05:43,049 --> 02:05:46,481
it's because
my father didn't like me

2373
02:05:48,416 --> 02:05:51,780
Or perhaps he didn't
have a camera back then

2374
02:05:52,049 --> 02:05:53,413
But I had one

2375
02:07:08,481 --> 02:07:11,710
Look Prasanna, what do you see?

2376
02:07:15,315 --> 02:07:20,441
30 years ago, our Gaju
stood in a hospital like this...

2377
02:07:21,382 --> 02:07:24,313
before a glass window like this

2378
02:07:25,514 --> 02:07:27,607
In the morning he got a call at office

2379
02:07:29,348 --> 02:07:33,474
Manda was in labor.
She was bleeding as well

2380
02:07:34,781 --> 02:07:36,248
He was baffled

2381
02:07:36,948 --> 02:07:40,437
How could she go into
labor in the 7th month?

2382
02:07:40,648 --> 02:07:42,546
He couldn't understand it

2383
02:07:43,649 --> 02:07:45,410
He didn't have any
time to think about it

2384
02:07:46,015 --> 02:07:49,414
He rushed Manda to the
nearest government hospital

2385
02:07:50,615 --> 02:07:54,343
The doctor said if the baby
wasn't delivered immediately...

2386
02:07:54,915 --> 02:07:56,881
both the mother and
baby's lives would be in danger

2387
02:07:58,215 --> 02:08:01,772
Gaju had no time to
consult with any of us

2388
02:08:03,781 --> 02:08:08,612
The baby, all covered in blood, and
smaller than the palm of his hand...

2389
02:08:09,948 --> 02:08:11,879
was delivered by the doctor

2390
02:08:18,381 --> 02:08:23,780
The baby's nostriIs were thinner than
the saline tubes, tiny and delicate

2391
02:08:25,447 --> 02:08:27,776
Cleaning the blood from the baby's
tiny nostriIs...

2392
02:08:28,447 --> 02:08:31,380
made the doctor breathless

2393
02:08:34,180 --> 02:08:35,544
But the doctor didn't give up

2394
02:08:36,881 --> 02:08:42,178
He managed to clean the
baby's nose before it suffocated

2395
02:08:44,447 --> 02:08:46,470
But the tougher task lay ahead

2396
02:08:47,481 --> 02:08:49,174
It was a government hospital...

2397
02:08:50,614 --> 02:08:56,308
and they didn't have the
incubator meant for premature babies

2398
02:08:58,314 --> 02:09:05,441
The doctor stepped out and
said the baby would survive...

2399
02:09:06,681 --> 02:09:09,648
only if it were shifted
to a private hospital nearby

2400
02:09:11,180 --> 02:09:18,671
Gaju wrapped the baby in cloth
and rushed to a private hospital

2401
02:09:20,115 --> 02:09:21,739
The doctors there were shocked

2402
02:09:21,813 --> 02:09:24,542
They couldn't believe he had brought
in a new-born baby just like that

2403
02:09:25,148 --> 02:09:29,205
They put the baby in an incubator

2404
02:09:32,214 --> 02:09:36,408
The baby weighed less
than the total weight...

2405
02:09:36,481 --> 02:09:38,641
of those tubes
in its nose and mouth

2406
02:09:39,880 --> 02:09:41,847
They could hear his heartbeat

2407
02:09:43,314 --> 02:09:49,111
One felt his skin would tear
if you touched it, it was so thin

2408
02:09:52,514 --> 02:09:55,742
It was through a window
like this that Gaja looked...

2409
02:09:56,648 --> 02:09:59,739
at his son entangled
in a net of tubes

2410
02:10:13,314 --> 02:10:16,508
The doctor came out and said...

2411
02:10:17,281 --> 02:10:20,111
'There is a 1 percent
chance that this baby will survive

2412
02:10:21,647 --> 02:10:27,739
It's up to you to decide how long you
will keep the baby in the incubator'

2413
02:10:29,414 --> 02:10:35,710
Within the fraction of a second
Gaja replied, 'Doctor, he is my son

2414
02:10:36,280 --> 02:10:38,576
Do what it takes to save him'

2415
02:10:45,647 --> 02:10:52,103
That 1 percent chance our Gaju took,
30 years ago, Prasanna, for you

2416
02:10:53,747 --> 02:10:55,180
He is your father

2417
02:10:57,446 --> 02:10:58,503
He may have been wrong

2418
02:11:00,114 --> 02:11:02,102
But why do you hold it
against him for your whole life?

2419
02:11:04,247 --> 02:11:06,270
When he dies, there'll
be nothing you can do but repent

2420
02:11:08,580 --> 02:11:10,047
Bhau, I want my father

2421
02:11:10,114 --> 02:11:11,376
Don't tell me

2422
02:11:11,713 --> 02:11:13,577
Go tell your father

2423
02:11:14,113 --> 02:11:19,205
He is on his way,
on a long journey, never to come back

2424
02:11:26,280 --> 02:11:32,373
You were God-like, you were my God

2425
02:11:32,446 --> 02:11:38,346
<i>When I played with you,
you were my plaything</i>

2426
02:11:38,414 --> 02:11:44,641
<i>I</i> was the Wise One,
you were the Crazy One

2427
02:11:44,712 --> 02:11:50,770
<i>For my sake,
you spent everything you had</i>

2428
02:11:51,046 --> 02:11:57,002
<i>Today, let me pay
back everything I owe you</i>

2429
02:11:57,079 --> 02:12:05,072
<i>If I am to live on,
I can't do it without you</i>

2430
02:12:06,113 --> 02:12:09,239
<i>Father...</i>

2431
02:12:09,313 --> 02:12:12,280
<i>Please, please wait</i>

2432
02:12:12,346 --> 02:12:15,335
<i>Father...</i>

2433
02:12:15,413 --> 02:12:23,405
<i>My feet burn from the heat of my tears</i>

2434
02:12:27,545 --> 02:12:33,603
<i>Call out to me, give me your hand...</i>

2435
02:12:33,979 --> 02:12:39,208
<i>please give me breath again</i>

2436
02:12:39,280 --> 02:12:43,235
<i>Father, please say something...</i>

2437
02:12:43,312 --> 02:12:46,245
<i>Something, please...</i>

2438
02:12:46,313 --> 02:12:49,540
<i>Say something...</i>

2439
02:12:49,612 --> 02:12:52,671
<i>Please... say something</i>

2440
02:12:55,346 --> 02:13:00,437
<i>Father, wait on</i>

2441
02:13:01,580 --> 02:13:07,570
<i>Father, don't leave for far away</i>

2442
02:13:07,647 --> 02:13:14,477
<i>Father, you wait...</i>

2443
02:13:29,046 --> 02:13:33,478
Bhau had warned us not
to switch the ventilator off

2444
02:13:35,978 --> 02:13:38,673
His son Prasanna will come to see him

2445
02:13:41,512 --> 02:13:42,569
Raja...

2446
02:13:49,445 --> 02:13:51,037
look, Prasanna is here

2447
02:14:04,345 --> 02:14:06,335
We didn't switch the ventilator off

2448
02:14:09,412 --> 02:14:11,311
Bhau was right

2449
02:16:39,045 --> 02:16:40,942
Your father will be happy

2450
02:16:43,177 --> 02:16:45,473
His Prasanna has come back home

2451
02:16:47,944 --> 02:16:49,240
He must be content

2452
02:16:50,912 --> 02:16:51,706
Go

2453
02:16:53,977 --> 02:16:55,001
Meet him
