1
00:01:04,791 --> 00:01:05,500
Make some space man...

2
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:06,708
Let there be some air circulation, go from here.

3
00:01:07,833 --> 00:01:09,333
Patela, come let's go.

4
00:01:11,916 --> 00:01:13,416
Bro, what’s up? A game or film?

5
00:01:13,625 --> 00:01:15,291
F*** results are out man..

6
00:01:17,166 --> 00:01:19,083
Patela, What happened with the tickets?

7
00:01:19,083 --> 00:01:20,458
They have been booked.

8
00:01:20,666 --> 00:01:22,041
Just have to get my bags.

9
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:24,375
What happened?

10
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:25,125
First class!

11
00:01:25,166 --> 00:01:25,958
Didn’t I tell you?

12
00:01:25,958 --> 00:01:27,291
Unnecessarily you were getting anxious.

13
00:01:27,291 --> 00:01:28,041
Did you check mine?

14
00:01:28,041 --> 00:01:28,916
Go check yourself.

15
00:01:28,916 --> 00:01:30,166
Didn’t I tell you Patela..

16
00:01:30,166 --> 00:01:32,458
..these girls are never to be trusted.

17
00:01:32,666 --> 00:01:33,500
Why didn’t you say?

18
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,958
He is so lazy!

19
00:01:34,958 --> 00:01:36,083
Let him sweat a bit too.

20
00:01:36,083 --> 00:01:37,500
He makes me do all his work, always.

21
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:40,416
Anyway, where is this stupid Meera?

22
00:01:40,416 --> 00:01:41,750
She was to come right here, isn’t it?

23
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,166
Every time it’s the same with her.

24
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,208
Careless about exam results.

25
00:01:48,125 --> 00:01:50,208
By the way, will you come home

26
00:01:50,208 --> 00:01:51,833
or will you meet at the bus station?

27
00:01:51,833 --> 00:01:53,041
I’ll meet at the bus station.

28
00:01:53,041 --> 00:01:54,333
Most likely my dad will drop me.

29
00:01:54,333 --> 00:01:55,541
Ok.

30
00:01:56,041 --> 00:01:57,791
Hey, I got my job offer letter!

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,458
Wow! That is amazing!

32
00:01:59,458 --> 00:02:00,958
Congratulations.

33
00:02:00,958 --> 00:02:02,166
It's through for me, you know, right?

34
00:02:02,166 --> 00:02:03,000
But...

35
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,416
I want to do my masters.

36
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:05,666
When are you applying?

37
00:02:05,666 --> 00:02:07,125
I have already done it.

38
00:02:07,125 --> 00:02:08,208
Have been accepted by two universities..

39
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:23,666
*Film playing in theatre*

40
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:19,125
Let us just sleep during travel,

41
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:20,041
not keep talking.

42
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:21,000
I am quite tired.

43
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:22,291
I hope there are no bedbugs.

44
00:03:24,958 --> 00:03:26,041
That is the bus, I was told.

45
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:27,375
Come let’s go.

46
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:29,375
Meera?

47
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:32,291
Oh!

48
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:32,916
Ok.

49
00:03:32,916 --> 00:03:33,666
Thanks auntie.

50
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:37,750
It seems she left at noon.

51
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:40,125
If she didn't want to come,

52
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:41,208
she should have informed us earlier.

53
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,791
It’s always the same with her.

54
00:03:43,208 --> 00:03:45,041
It is so difficult to get her.

55
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:46,833
Wonder where she went.

56
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:48,083
Should we inform her mother,

57
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:49,208
that she is not with us?

58
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:50,125
May be we shouldn’t.

59
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:52,000
It would get her worried.

60
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:54,125
She will be fine wherever she is.

61
00:03:56,791 --> 00:03:57,833
What do we do now?

62
00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:01,041
Please do not change the plan.

63
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:02,083
Girl: No chance.

64
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:04,041
I am not returning home after coming so far.

65
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:06,750
Rarely do I get permission to go on such trips.

66
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,750
Please! Come.

67
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,750
Come...come let’s go…let's go..

68
00:04:35,416 --> 00:04:38,291
"You are the one for me, my friend"

69
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:41,333
"You are the one"

70
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:45,041
“You are the one for me, my friend"

71
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:47,583
“You are the one"

72
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:51,666
“For all the worlds inside of me"

73
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:57,458
“You are the only ruler"

74
00:04:58,791 --> 00:05:01,666
"You are the one for me, my friend"

75
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:04,416
"You are the one"

76
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,541
“You are the one for me, my friend"

77
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:14,041
"For all the talks of my heart"

78
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:19,708
"You are the only form"

79
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:23,625
"You are the one for me, my friend"

80
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:26,291
"You are the one"

81
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:29,916
"You are the one for me, my friend"

82
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:32,083
This silence.

83
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,583
This is it for me, I guess.

84
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:06,250
All that I thought life was,

85
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:10,166
it has been a journey of proving me wrong.

86
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:11,583
Till now.

87
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:14,666
I learnt life through cinema.

88
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:18,375
If I am not in a theatre, hiding behind a story,

89
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:20,166
here, in this place,

90
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:22,166
in the arms of these mountains is where..

91
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:24,125
I feel at home.

92
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:33,083
Cinema has been a friend,

93
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:34,083
a companion,

94
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:34,541
a guru.

95
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:35,166
Everything.

96
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:39,541
I feel stuck somewhere between life and cinema,

97
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:41,250
Now in this real life,

98
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,916
what to expect out of it?

99
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:43,958
I don't know.

100
00:07:44,708 --> 00:07:46,666
How to be in this world?

101
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:49,166
Not sure anymore.

102
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:51,333
That day,

103
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,583
as much as I want to forget,

104
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:54,500
I can’t.

105
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:57,625
My brain holds vivid visual memories,

106
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:00,875
a curse or a boon, I don’t know.

107
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,166
I think I was 9 years old.

108
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:08,083
It was summer holidays,

109
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,875
and all my friends were at their grandparents’ houses

110
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:12,541
or at their relatives’ houses!

111
00:08:13,416 --> 00:08:14,625
I was alone,

112
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:16,083
as usual.

113
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:20,125
I never went to relatives houses,

114
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:23,708
never felt close to any of them.

115
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:25,458
These hills

116
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:28,041
and those rocks were more real than any human I knew.

117
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:32,791
My parents were at work.

118
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:46,541
It was thrilling,

119
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:48,416
I was scared

120
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:49,541
but I went in anyway.

121
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:54,583
I had always wanted to watch movies sitting in front rows.

122
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:57,083
Dad somehow never took us there.

123
00:08:57,875 --> 00:09:23,000
*Film plays in theatre*

124
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:02,416
I couldn’t even look at his face,

125
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,208
I couldn’t understand what just happened,

126
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:08,291
but I could feel it was wrong.

127
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,541
I wanted to run back home

128
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:13,041
But I couldn’t.

129
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:15,875
I wanted to watch the film,

130
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:17,875
I was there for that.

131
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:29,166
I couldn’t let that man decide my movie experience.

132
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:43,416
So I sat again to continue watching the film

133
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:50,000
but all through looking at front rows,

134
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:52,583
trying to locate who that man was.

135
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:56,500
But they were all just black shadows.

136
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:06,000
I don’t want to write about the abuses that I went through,

137
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,833
my time or my mind space,

138
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:11,666
such men don't deserve either.

139
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:14,958
But this incident … there is a link…

140
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:17,708
there is always a link to everything.

141
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:22,583
My mom didn’t want me to grow up there in that town,

142
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:26,166
she feared I would elope with someone!

143
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:29,666
So we shifted to a bigger city.

144
00:11:58,166 --> 00:12:00,333
Bro, What a beautiful babe!

145
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:03,458
Why sweetheart, won’t you look at me?

146
00:12:08,666 --> 00:12:10,791
The bus is here, let's be fast.

147
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:13,833
If you go like this, you think I will leave you alone?

148
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:33,041
Don't help her,

149
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:34,416
she never learns.

150
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:37,083
Hi, hi!

151
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:38,958
I was sitting idle at home…

152
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:40,291
Hey, your love interest is here.

153
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:42,458
Go go...tell her today at least!

154
00:12:42,541 --> 00:12:43,416
Meera wait

155
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:46,583
Ohhh Meeraaa...

156
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:48,833
Come Saji, let's go in

157
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:54,958
Is it for me?

158
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:56,875
Yes for you.

159
00:12:58,375 --> 00:12:59,375
Why?

160
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:00,541
Just like that.

161
00:13:00,541 --> 00:13:02,791
It was like an artwork.

162
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:05,250
Considering his efforts, I couldn’t refuse it.

163
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:07,208
Thanks.

164
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:08,958
Just thanks?

165
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:11,666
What more should I be saying?

166
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:13,916
Okay…

167
00:13:15,541 --> 00:13:18,083
I have to write news, see she hasn't....

168
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:19,083
Here she is.

169
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:20,791
Wow, what is this?

170
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:22,416
He has given you a rose!

171
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:23,750
But I didn’t know,

172
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:26,708
accepting the rose had other meanings to it.

173
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:30,250
Bro, she accepted!

174
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:32,250
You managed to win over her!

175
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:34,375
Say Meera!! What did you tell him?

176
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:42,166
See here, I have a doubt.

177
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:45,916
Sow, you first write down the formula.

178
00:13:45,916 --> 00:13:48,125
Cancel that, write it afresh.

179
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:48,708
Hi Meera..

180
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:49,875
Hi.

181
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:50,375
Hi Meera.

182
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:50,833
Hi.

183
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,500
A plus B square

184
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,541
whole square, ok?

185
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:55,375
is equal to

186
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:56,416
A square

187
00:13:56,416 --> 00:13:57,458
plus two A B

188
00:13:57,458 --> 00:13:58,500
plus B square.

189
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:00,875
Write down the problem.

190
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:02,166
X plus six

191
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:03,750
into X plus two

192
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:05,166
is equal to X

193
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:07,833
X plus 2

194
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:09,833
In our town,

195
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:12,250
boys and girls, all used to bathe together.

196
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:14,250
So this didn’t seem odd.

197
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:15,750
OK

198
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:18,250
Substitute the value of X

199
00:14:20,416 --> 00:14:22,583
*Kannada song playing in the background*

200
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:28,541
Bro, what are they doing with their hands?

201
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:30,958
Should we give them some money?

202
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:32,041
May be we should do that.

203
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:34,000
Already our class has ill-reputation,

204
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,875
these girls are going to ruin it further.

205
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:36,541
Hi Meera.

206
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:38,541
What are you doing?

207
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:39,416
Show!

208
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:49,500
Not sure if that relationship would have become something,

209
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:50,541
BUT…

210
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:11,708
I feel stressed to come to school.

211
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:13,416
He troubles too much.

212
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:15,583
He came near bus stop yesterday, you know?

213
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:17,541
Last week he had come near the tailor shop.

214
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:18,375
Hi Meera.

215
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:20,125
Now he is sitting here.

216
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:25,833
Sajida

217
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:27,708
Che! Again he is sitting behind.

218
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:29,291
He is such a torture everyday.

219
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:32,333
Sajida…

220
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:35,041
Sajida…

221
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:37,708
Meera,

222
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:40,000
please ask her to talk to me.

223
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:41,458
Come let’s go sit in the front.

224
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:43,250
Please talk to him and resolve, Saji

225
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:44,833
Else he keeps bothering me.

226
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:47,375
He came near my house, asking me to show your house.

227
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:50,666
I said 'I love you', why don't you say anything?

228
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:53,791
Mohan please. I don’t like these things.

229
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:55,208
Saji…

230
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:58,208
Tell him my parents are looking for a groom for me already.

231
00:15:58,208 --> 00:15:58,958
What?

232
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:04,625
Mohan...

233
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:05,666
Mohan...Mohan...

234
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:06,375
Hey,

235
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:13,000
what are you doing Mohan?

236
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:14,708
Ma’m, Bathroom?

237
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:15,083
OK, Go.

238
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:19,166
Good morning Miss.

239
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:20,166
Good morning.

240
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:22,500
Here as well.

241
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:25,791
I love her. Tell her that.

242
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:28,625
Who told you, such acts would make her fall for you?

243
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:31,541
I should get her. That is it.

244
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:41,541
Were they inspired by Shahrukh Khan’s film ‘Darr’,

245
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:43,875
or the new release, ‘Om’? I don't know.

246
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:46,583
Not sure if people remember climax of these films,

247
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:48,833
but, "I Love You, You Must Love Me"

248
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:51,750
was the line used to torture the girls, endlessly.

249
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:07,041
In such climate,

250
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:08,916
I saw 'Hum Aapke Hai Kaun' film.

251
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:10,375
I was in 9th grade.

252
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:27,375
*Film playing in theatre*

253
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:30,500
Salman Khan became that first dream!

254
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:03,291
If I ever have babies,

255
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:05,083
it had to be from him, so I decided.

256
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:06,916
I wrote letters every day to him.

257
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:09,750
I somehow wanted to send them to him!

258
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:27,625
Meera,

259
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:29,250
where is the electricity bill?

260
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:31,333
It must be right there, see Ma.

261
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:33,291
Where is it, kid?

262
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,250
The same breakfast again?

263
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:43,416
Wasn’t it different yesterday?

264
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:51,416
Did you find it? it was right there.

265
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:53,250
Ma, please Ma,

266
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:54,375
please don’t read it.

267
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:56,041
What is all this Meera?

268
00:18:57,041 --> 00:18:57,916
Who is he?

269
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:00,541
Salman Khan.

270
00:19:00,958 --> 00:19:01,791
Who is he?

271
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:04,375
He is a cinema hero.

272
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:07,041
This is why your exam scores have collapsed.

273
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Ma, please,

274
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,333
that's not because of him.

275
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:12,458
Please don’t say anything against him.

276
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:14,375
How dare you talk back to me?

277
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:17,000
If I come across something of this kind again,

278
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:18,791
I won't send you to school thereafter.

279
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:20,583
Now go get ready for school.

280
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:25,875
That slap pushed him deeper into my heart.

281
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:30,833
How would he have saved me from my mother, if he was around!

282
00:19:47,916 --> 00:19:50,541
On the day of white uniform,

283
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:52,291
why do they have to have parade?

284
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:53,666
God knows!

285
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:55,916
Once our bus friend became the school leader,

286
00:19:55,916 --> 00:19:57,250
we had our own rules!

287
00:19:57,375 --> 00:19:58,958
Hey..What are you doing?

288
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,583
Lemon rice man.

289
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:02,458
This is Babu's.

290
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:04,125
If he gets to know he will cry.

291
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:05,291
How will he know?

292
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:06,958
Only if you tell him, he will know isn't it?

293
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:08,916
What are you all doing here?

294
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:11,666
Eight of you.

295
00:20:11,666 --> 00:20:13,041
We are cleaning.

296
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:13,916
Cleaning?

297
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:17,083
Dust and paper pieces are scattered all over.

298
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:18,500
What sort of cleaning is this?

299
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,708
It’s clean there, see.

300
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:21,583
By the time you clean, assembly would get over.

301
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:22,208
You all?

302
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:23,541
Stomach ache.

303
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:25,958
You were fine in the morning.

304
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:27,250
It began all of a sudden.

305
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:29,541
Show me,

306
00:20:29,541 --> 00:20:30,416
what marks have you given?

307
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:32,166
I can’t show like that.

308
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:35,458
They will mark us as an indisciplined class again.

309
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:36,416
You deserve it.

310
00:20:36,416 --> 00:20:38,958
The principal will make us stand out in the sun.

311
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:40,333
I will see you in the bus.

312
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:42,250
Go inside before somebody sees.

313
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:44,500
Boys, clean properly.

314
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:00,250
Sow,

315
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:03,291
Doesn't Madhu look a bit like Salman Khan?

316
00:21:05,708 --> 00:21:07,875
Prajwal, go clean there in the front.

317
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:10,083
Yes, actually. In some angles.

318
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,333
Which angle is it?

319
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:14,750
He looks a bit like monkey though.

320
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:17,458
Madhu.

321
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:19,000
Madhusudan.

322
00:21:19,375 --> 00:21:21,250
In a class of 63 students.

323
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:23,500
his presence never mattered.

324
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:25,375
But that day…

325
00:21:27,333 --> 00:21:29,041
Why are you staring?

326
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:33,916
If you tell Babu…

327
00:21:33,916 --> 00:21:34,916
If I tell…

328
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:37,291
Your lunch box will be emptied tomorrow.

329
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:39,916
I got so scared.

330
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:42,916
Hey...Jyothi...monkey...

331
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:58,541
*National Anthem in the background*

332
00:22:06,833 --> 00:22:08,416
On one such Wednesday,

333
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:10,875
while in white uniform

334
00:22:10,875 --> 00:22:12,458
and while on periods,

335
00:22:12,958 --> 00:22:15,125
I fell in love for the first time.

336
00:22:15,791 --> 00:22:17,750
Was it love? I am not sure.

337
00:22:18,166 --> 00:22:20,833
Or was it a desire to experience like in the movies..

338
00:22:20,833 --> 00:22:23,958
between the hero and the heroine, I don't know!

339
00:22:24,958 --> 00:22:29,208
But I wasn’t the same old self from that moment.

340
00:22:44,125 --> 00:22:45,125
Meera wait,

341
00:22:45,125 --> 00:22:46,958
I don't have Kho Kho practice today.

342
00:22:46,958 --> 00:22:48,125
Come fast then.

343
00:22:48,666 --> 00:22:50,250
Hey what is with her?

344
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:53,083
Hey Meera...

345
00:22:53,625 --> 00:22:54,708
Wait up.

346
00:22:54,708 --> 00:22:55,791
Everyday you delay,

347
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:57,250
what is the hurry today?

348
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:24,875
“You are the name for my deep breaths”

349
00:23:27,583 --> 00:23:30,041
“You are the cause of this burning heart”

350
00:23:32,833 --> 00:23:36,500
“You are the way out for each of my desires”

351
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:39,708
“You are the destination”

352
00:23:42,125 --> 00:23:45,583
“You are the letters of each word I utter”

353
00:23:47,541 --> 00:23:50,583
“You are the echo of each unspoken word”

354
00:23:52,833 --> 00:23:55,791
“You are the King of this unknown world”

355
00:23:57,875 --> 00:24:00,500
“You are the beginning for me to know it all”

356
00:24:04,166 --> 00:24:06,291
“You are the anxiety of my fingers”

357
00:24:10,166 --> 00:24:12,958
“You are the scar of a wound that I was unaware of”

358
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:17,958
“You are the pain that I deeply want”

359
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:22,958
“You are reason behind the smiles and laughters”

360
00:24:25,666 --> 00:24:28,583
“You are the throbbing compassion of my cells”

361
00:24:30,833 --> 00:24:32,416
“Please be like this my love,

362
00:24:33,458 --> 00:24:35,125
"inside me,”

363
00:24:35,666 --> 00:24:37,083
“comfortably.”

364
00:24:38,458 --> 00:24:40,041
"I will keep you warm.”

365
00:24:41,416 --> 00:24:43,333
Didn't I tell you he will be late?

366
00:24:44,958 --> 00:24:46,958
Saji, please don't talk.

367
00:24:46,958 --> 00:24:48,875
Not me, she pulled me to talk.

368
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:44,208
Not today.

369
00:25:44,208 --> 00:25:45,500
Why today?

370
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:46,791
He can't stop talking about her.

371
00:25:46,791 --> 00:25:47,833
Are you sure?

372
00:25:47,833 --> 00:25:48,875
Sure?

373
00:25:48,875 --> 00:25:50,000
Meera, wait.

374
00:25:50,625 --> 00:25:52,083
What is it, Prajwal?

375
00:25:53,333 --> 00:25:53,958
Hey.

376
00:25:53,958 --> 00:25:55,458
You have been smitten by Madhu, isn’t it?

377
00:25:56,625 --> 00:25:57,666
Smitten?

378
00:25:57,666 --> 00:26:00,041
For all the turbulence within me,

379
00:26:00,041 --> 00:26:02,458
the word 'smitten' seemed cheap!

380
00:26:05,166 --> 00:26:06,041
I don’t know.

381
00:26:06,041 --> 00:26:08,250
But I feel somewhat...for him.

382
00:26:09,708 --> 00:26:10,291
Hey wait.

383
00:26:10,291 --> 00:26:12,500
Don’t you want to know how he feels?

384
00:26:15,916 --> 00:26:16,750
Hey Hey....

385
00:26:17,625 --> 00:26:20,583
Even he also feels somewhat….u know?

386
00:26:23,833 --> 00:26:24,791
Okay.

387
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,166
I never sweat.

388
00:26:27,416 --> 00:26:29,125
That day for the first time,

389
00:26:29,125 --> 00:26:31,500
I felt sweat break under my arm.

390
00:26:33,166 --> 00:26:35,875
Hey say it..What was he saying?

391
00:26:39,166 --> 00:26:40,458
Why are you smiling?

392
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:47,875
Next day, I felt a bit awkward to go to school.

393
00:26:49,875 --> 00:26:52,250
I could hear my heartbeat.

394
00:26:54,625 --> 00:26:57,833
I felt feverish, my stomach was churning.

395
00:26:57,833 --> 00:27:00,791
I was pukish, felt I might have loose motions!

396
00:27:26,041 --> 00:27:27,791
Miss, Can I Come in?

397
00:27:27,791 --> 00:27:28,875
Why Meera?

398
00:27:28,875 --> 00:27:30,000
Why are you late?

399
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,291
Come in.

400
00:27:31,708 --> 00:27:33,250
I missed the bus…

401
00:27:33,625 --> 00:27:34,791
errr…Stomach ache.

402
00:27:34,791 --> 00:27:36,583
You better decide first..

403
00:27:36,583 --> 00:27:38,250
You missed the bus or stomach ache?

404
00:27:38,833 --> 00:27:39,958
Both.

405
00:27:59,875 --> 00:28:01,000
Meera

406
00:28:01,333 --> 00:28:02,208
Meera

407
00:28:11,791 --> 00:28:14,791
*Note: Meera, Shall we get married? from, Madhu*

408
00:28:14,791 --> 00:28:16,583
My Madhu's handwriting.

409
00:28:17,208 --> 00:28:18,708
I had never noticed it before.

410
00:28:20,916 --> 00:28:23,291
How shabbily he writes!

411
00:28:50,958 --> 00:28:53,708
Watching them play is such a waste of time.

412
00:28:53,708 --> 00:28:56,500
How badly they lost yesterday, isn't it?

413
00:29:04,125 --> 00:29:06,458
He came here now, see.

414
00:29:36,708 --> 00:29:37,958
You haven’t said anything?

415
00:29:39,125 --> 00:29:40,250
Regarding what?

416
00:29:42,833 --> 00:29:43,625
Ok. Forget it.

417
00:29:45,666 --> 00:29:46,875
Where are you going?

418
00:29:50,708 --> 00:29:51,833
Shall we?

419
00:29:54,625 --> 00:29:55,833
I don’t know.

420
00:29:58,625 --> 00:29:59,541
Now?

421
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:02,625
I don’t know.

422
00:30:04,916 --> 00:30:05,791
Next?

423
00:30:07,166 --> 00:30:08,000
I don’t know.

424
00:30:16,166 --> 00:30:17,541
Bro Madhu, come.

425
00:30:17,958 --> 00:30:18,750
Coming…

426
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:35,208
It is not even his bus stop,

427
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:36,875
but he is walking this way today.

428
00:30:38,458 --> 00:30:40,333
Even this girl here is smiling.

429
00:30:40,333 --> 00:30:41,750
She is being secretive with us.

430
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,583
Even Madhu failed us.

431
00:30:44,583 --> 00:30:45,708
He also got out.

432
00:30:47,125 --> 00:30:48,666
Hey, where are you going?

433
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,666
"Even the moving breeze"

434
00:31:28,666 --> 00:31:33,333
"Desires your breath"

435
00:31:33,333 --> 00:31:35,916
"Sliding from your neckline"

436
00:31:35,916 --> 00:31:37,833
"Riding on the rainbow"

437
00:31:37,833 --> 00:31:41,041
"Reaching the destination in the finger tips"

438
00:31:41,041 --> 00:31:43,625
"I am you now"

439
00:31:43,625 --> 00:31:48,125
"Life has merged with you now"

440
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,125
"Sliding from your neckline"

441
00:32:02,125 --> 00:32:03,791
"Riding on the rainbow"

442
00:32:03,791 --> 00:32:06,541
"Reaching the destination in the finger tips"

443
00:32:06,541 --> 00:32:09,750
"I am you now"

444
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:12,083
We were discussing figure of speech, weren't we?

445
00:32:12,125 --> 00:32:13,541
Yes Mam.

446
00:32:13,541 --> 00:32:16,791
Today, let's understand Metaphors.

447
00:32:18,166 --> 00:32:19,083
What is it Madhu?

448
00:32:19,375 --> 00:32:20,083
Nothing madam.

449
00:32:26,666 --> 00:32:27,958
Shall I give you a test?

450
00:32:27,958 --> 00:32:29,875
No Miss.

451
00:32:29,916 --> 00:32:31,083
That's very bad.

452
00:32:31,083 --> 00:32:32,583
Sorry, Sorry Miss.

453
00:32:33,041 --> 00:32:34,541
If you apologise now?

454
00:32:34,625 --> 00:32:36,125
Can't you guys be adults?

455
00:32:36,125 --> 00:32:39,083
and behave once you enter the class?

456
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:40,833
Go Sit.

457
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:42,125
Don't repeat this mistake.

458
00:32:45,333 --> 00:32:47,708
"You shone”

459
00:32:47,708 --> 00:32:50,250
"I became the light"

460
00:32:50,916 --> 00:32:52,750
"Blossomed as flower"

461
00:32:53,166 --> 00:32:56,083
"That I became your fragrance"

462
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:01,333
"You engulfed me without my notice"

463
00:33:01,916 --> 00:33:04,125
"Became one, melting"

464
00:33:04,208 --> 00:33:07,375
"Together, consuming"

465
00:33:07,416 --> 00:33:09,375
"You, my soulmate"

466
00:33:10,041 --> 00:33:13,333
"You are my soulmate!!"

467
00:33:16,583 --> 00:33:19,166
"Sky is vast, but what is empty?"

468
00:33:19,166 --> 00:33:21,541
"You are the blue that is spread across"

469
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:24,083
"In each of the cells, in and out..."

470
00:33:24,083 --> 00:33:26,708
"You are the only one"

471
00:33:26,708 --> 00:33:30,625
"You are the only one"

472
00:33:37,416 --> 00:33:39,500
Pythagoras theorem is applicable to...

473
00:33:45,166 --> 00:33:47,791
Pythagoras theorem is applicable to what kind of triangles?

474
00:33:47,791 --> 00:33:50,416
Right angled triangles.

475
00:33:51,291 --> 00:33:52,708
Go, have lunch.

476
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:56,625
How joyfully you say it!

477
00:33:56,625 --> 00:33:57,958
It is all because of him.

478
00:33:57,958 --> 00:33:58,458
Hey

479
00:33:58,458 --> 00:33:59,208
Who is the captain?

480
00:33:59,458 --> 00:34:00,166
It is him.

481
00:34:00,875 --> 00:34:01,583
Madhu.

482
00:34:01,583 --> 00:34:02,958
Learn to take responsibility.

483
00:34:02,958 --> 00:34:05,166
Did you not find anybody else to lose against?

484
00:34:05,583 --> 00:34:06,875
Next time we will win, sir.

485
00:34:07,791 --> 00:34:09,375
Go, have lunch.

486
00:34:09,958 --> 00:34:11,166
What happened to the match?

487
00:34:11,166 --> 00:34:12,291
We lost.

488
00:34:12,583 --> 00:34:13,583
All because of him!

489
00:34:13,666 --> 00:34:14,833
Why do you say so?

490
00:34:16,458 --> 00:34:17,166
Hi Ding.

491
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:18,500
What?

492
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:19,708
It is a short form for Darling.

493
00:34:21,541 --> 00:34:23,958
Here I was, writing poetry for him,

494
00:34:23,958 --> 00:34:26,958
there he is, fishing for the most unromantic word in English  
 dictionary...

495
00:34:27,458 --> 00:34:28,041
Darling...

496
00:34:28,333 --> 00:34:30,333
chopping it further to make it 'ding'!

497
00:34:31,125 --> 00:34:32,625
But still it felt mine.

498
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:33,958
It was just for me,

499
00:34:34,625 --> 00:34:35,333
from him.

500
00:34:36,708 --> 00:34:37,916
Shall we go for lunch?

501
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:39,875
Yes.

502
00:34:41,833 --> 00:34:53,250
*Singing a Kannada film song*

503
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:55,166
Next time call us also.

504
00:34:55,166 --> 00:34:57,083
Two of us are not able to win it....

505
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,041
Shit.

506
00:35:06,375 --> 00:35:07,291
Whose idea is this,

507
00:35:07,333 --> 00:35:09,916
to close the gate during lunch break?

508
00:35:09,916 --> 00:35:11,916
Must be our teddy bear principal's idea.

509
00:35:11,916 --> 00:35:12,458
Wait!

510
00:35:12,458 --> 00:35:14,083
Should I go bring your girl or what?

511
00:35:14,083 --> 00:35:14,750
Oh.

512
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,625
He doesn't do it,

513
00:35:17,083 --> 00:35:18,583
he doesn't let us also do it.

514
00:35:18,625 --> 00:35:19,458
Climb.

515
00:35:22,791 --> 00:35:26,916
*Song playing in the radio*

516
00:35:30,916 --> 00:35:32,083
Brother, did you have lunch?

517
00:35:32,083 --> 00:35:32,583
Yes sir.

518
00:35:32,958 --> 00:35:33,666
Did you?

519
00:35:33,708 --> 00:35:34,416
Yes.

520
00:35:34,416 --> 00:35:36,208
It is quite cold, isn’t it?

521
00:35:41,541 --> 00:35:43,541
We should have got Jyothi along with us!

522
00:35:43,541 --> 00:35:45,291
Will bring her tomorrow.

523
00:35:45,291 --> 00:35:46,791
What is happening between you two?

524
00:35:46,791 --> 00:35:48,083
Nothing. Just…

525
00:35:53,125 --> 00:35:54,625
Give me a drag.

526
00:35:56,208 --> 00:35:56,750
Hey

527
00:35:56,750 --> 00:35:57,416
What is this?

528
00:35:57,625 --> 00:35:58,583
Like good girls,

529
00:35:58,583 --> 00:36:01,541
you should be asking me to quit smoking..

530
00:36:01,625 --> 00:36:03,125
Instead you’re asking for a drag.

531
00:36:03,375 --> 00:36:05,750
Haven't you seen what the heroine does in the movies?

532
00:36:06,625 --> 00:36:08,166
Like a 'good girl'?

533
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:13,416
Why couldn’t I judge him as good or bad, even though he was   
 smoking?

534
00:36:16,041 --> 00:36:17,000
Just give it.

535
00:36:18,208 --> 00:36:19,791
Stop snatching.

536
00:36:25,791 --> 00:36:26,750
Bro...

537
00:36:27,291 --> 00:36:28,500
Ganganna, the attender is here.

538
00:36:29,833 --> 00:36:31,500
Come, let's hurry.

539
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:38,500
What is this?

540
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:39,416
Beetle nuts.

541
00:36:39,416 --> 00:36:40,833
Eat it. Else, Your mouth will stink.

542
00:36:43,375 --> 00:36:45,916
You had the same excuse last time as well?

543
00:36:45,916 --> 00:36:47,666
No miss.

544
00:36:47,666 --> 00:36:49,458
Go bring your notes first.

545
00:36:49,708 --> 00:36:50,750
Miss, miss, please.

546
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,708
Ma’m, please correct our notes fast.

547
00:36:53,166 --> 00:36:54,958
I am correcting, can't you see?

548
00:36:54,958 --> 00:36:57,000
I will correct yours too. Go sit.

549
00:36:58,083 --> 00:36:59,416
There's something inside.

550
00:37:02,666 --> 00:37:03,791
Is it for teacher?

551
00:37:03,833 --> 00:37:04,541
Yes.

552
00:37:05,083 --> 00:37:05,791
OK.

553
00:37:05,791 --> 00:37:06,708
Hey!

554
00:37:07,083 --> 00:37:09,625
Until you bring the notes and submit,

555
00:37:09,625 --> 00:37:11,625
don't talk to me, go kneel down there.

556
00:37:11,625 --> 00:37:12,458
Go there.

557
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:13,333
Miss...

558
00:37:13,333 --> 00:37:15,541
I will be very embarrassed in front of the girls.

559
00:37:15,541 --> 00:37:16,833
Please miss.

560
00:37:24,875 --> 00:37:27,375
*Note : I want kiss, I want kiss, Please.*

561
00:37:28,458 --> 00:37:30,083
What is this?

562
00:37:36,791 --> 00:37:37,625
Meera

563
00:37:38,791 --> 00:37:39,458
Meera…

564
00:37:41,958 --> 00:37:42,958
Meera…

565
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:46,041
Monisha

566
00:37:46,291 --> 00:37:48,375
I have kept scale somewhere, go get it.

567
00:37:48,375 --> 00:37:49,958
Miss....miss...miss...no miss

568
00:37:50,083 --> 00:38:11,583
*Singing film songs*

569
00:38:11,583 --> 00:38:13,166
Sing a song from the letter ‘ma’

570
00:38:13,166 --> 00:38:14,291
Again?

571
00:38:14,291 --> 00:38:16,875
Don’t know any other song…

572
00:38:16,875 --> 00:38:19,000
Pearl, pearl (also means kiss)...

573
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,833
your speech is like a pearl

574
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,125
Pearl, pearl

575
00:38:23,125 --> 00:38:24,500
Kiss it seems…Meera?

576
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,333
Your kiss

577
00:38:26,333 --> 00:38:28,291
got me high

578
00:38:36,875 --> 00:38:38,250
Your kiss

579
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:41,416
Your speech is like pearl…

580
00:38:43,666 --> 00:38:44,750
Do you have any doubts?

581
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:46,500
No Sir.

582
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:47,958
Anybody wants their answer sheets?

583
00:38:47,958 --> 00:38:49,541
No sir.

584
00:38:49,708 --> 00:38:50,500
Do you want marks?

585
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:52,125
Yes sir…

586
00:38:52,208 --> 00:38:53,333
Come in.

587
00:38:57,875 --> 00:39:00,125
Why isn’t anyone scoring well?

588
00:39:01,041 --> 00:39:01,833
Jyothi...

589
00:39:03,833 --> 00:39:05,416
Good, you have improved!

590
00:39:06,375 --> 00:39:07,000
Prajwal..

591
00:39:10,125 --> 00:39:11,333
What is this?

592
00:39:12,666 --> 00:39:13,833
Visit the school a bit more!

593
00:39:14,583 --> 00:39:16,625
Are you not able to follow my teaching?

594
00:39:16,916 --> 00:39:18,041
Math doesn't enter my head sir.

595
00:39:18,041 --> 00:39:19,375
Should I take special class for you?

596
00:39:20,041 --> 00:39:21,208
It would be just a waste of time, sir.

597
00:39:23,708 --> 00:39:24,708
In your board exams,

598
00:39:24,708 --> 00:39:26,041
I won’t be correcting your answer sheets

599
00:39:26,958 --> 00:39:29,000
to pass you all with grace marks.

600
00:39:32,458 --> 00:39:33,208
Meera.

601
00:39:35,791 --> 00:39:36,458
Very good.

602
00:39:36,833 --> 00:39:37,583
Thank you Sir.

603
00:39:37,583 --> 00:39:38,416
Stay back.

604
00:39:38,583 --> 00:39:40,875
Third time consecutively, Meera has scored full marks.

605
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:44,291
Sir…

606
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:46,208
Tell me, Madhu.

607
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:47,666
What's your doubt?

608
00:39:48,708 --> 00:39:50,625
Sir if someone owes something to someone,

609
00:39:50,875 --> 00:39:54,166
if they don’t give it within the time, can we ask for  
interest?

610
00:39:55,375 --> 00:39:56,666
It depends...

611
00:39:57,041 --> 00:39:59,958
Who has to give who and what was the agreement....

612
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:01,333
Why?

613
00:40:01,875 --> 00:40:03,916
What have you borrowed, from whom?

614
00:40:04,541 --> 00:40:05,500
Nothing, sir.

615
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:07,750
Just asked. Hypothetically.

616
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:09,333
He got caught.

617
00:40:09,416 --> 00:40:10,958
Hypothetically!

618
00:40:11,583 --> 00:40:13,791
What does it mean? Do you know?

619
00:40:14,458 --> 00:40:16,291
If you knew, why doesn't it reflect in your marks?

620
00:40:19,666 --> 00:40:21,500
Where is your answer sheet?

621
00:41:41,416 --> 00:41:42,958
You keep walking. I will join.

622
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:43,958
What is the matter?

623
00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:45,875
I have one doubt in math

624
00:41:45,875 --> 00:41:47,041
I will discuss it, then join you.

625
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:49,125
Can you not do that tomorrow?

626
00:41:49,125 --> 00:41:50,958
I might forget it tomorrow Jyo.

627
00:41:51,416 --> 00:41:53,583
Okay, we will wait at the bus stop.

628
00:41:54,083 --> 00:41:55,500
Such a geek she is.

629
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:57,166
Come soon, Meera.

630
00:42:30,625 --> 00:42:31,750
Come see here.

631
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:32,875
Lights seem to be on.

632
00:42:44,625 --> 00:42:46,041
You thought I had left.

633
00:42:46,375 --> 00:42:47,125
Yes.

634
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,875
Seems he had gone to wash his face. Idiot.

635
00:42:50,875 --> 00:42:52,416
He smelled so good.

636
00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:55,041
Cuticura (talcum powder)?

637
00:43:03,666 --> 00:43:04,875
That moment.

638
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:06,833
I wanted it so much.

639
00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:28,875
What if I get pregnant?

640
00:43:29,916 --> 00:43:30,958
Pregnant?

641
00:43:31,541 --> 00:43:34,250
If this is how one got pregnant....

642
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:35,833
Then how?

643
00:43:35,833 --> 00:43:36,833
Then....

644
00:43:44,458 --> 00:43:45,208
Meera?

645
00:43:45,208 --> 00:43:47,000
Why are you still here?

646
00:43:47,208 --> 00:43:48,833
Sir, I had forgotten my tiffin box.

647
00:43:49,083 --> 00:43:51,083
Is it a thing to forget?

648
00:43:51,375 --> 00:43:53,625
The rains have just stopped, reach home soon.

649
00:43:53,625 --> 00:43:55,541
It might start raining again.

650
00:43:55,916 --> 00:43:57,000
Ganganna,

651
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,166
See that classroom.

652
00:43:58,625 --> 00:44:00,375
Door is open, please close it.

653
00:44:01,250 --> 00:44:02,416
You should check these things.

654
00:44:10,875 --> 00:44:11,791
She also came.

655
00:44:11,791 --> 00:44:12,916
finally!

656
00:44:18,375 --> 00:44:19,500
Hey,

657
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:20,958
This year in Biology,

658
00:44:21,583 --> 00:44:22,291
baby...

659
00:44:22,583 --> 00:44:24,000
they will teach how it happens.

660
00:44:29,291 --> 00:44:30,541
What is that?

661
00:44:30,875 --> 00:44:31,791
What?

662
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:32,666
What?

663
00:44:33,291 --> 00:44:34,041
What?

664
00:44:34,041 --> 00:44:35,083
That's what I am asking, what?

665
00:44:35,083 --> 00:44:37,916
Our biology teacher skipped that chapter.

666
00:44:38,166 --> 00:44:42,541
Had to watch porn later on to learn how one conceives.

667
00:44:50,875 --> 00:44:53,458
My spectacles is all wet.

668
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:55,125
I should keep it inside.

669
00:44:55,125 --> 00:44:57,208
Shall we go to eat some fries?

670
00:44:57,208 --> 00:44:58,666
It is kind of late today Jyo.

671
00:44:58,666 --> 00:45:00,208
Let's go tomorrow, ok?

672
00:45:04,708 --> 00:45:06,166
Oh shit, he is here again.

673
00:45:06,166 --> 00:45:07,458
Meera, stop.

674
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:10,125
I asked you not to follow us like this, didn’t I?

675
00:45:13,416 --> 00:45:15,250
You don’t talk to me near your school.

676
00:45:15,666 --> 00:45:16,583
Listen madam,

677
00:45:16,791 --> 00:45:18,875
our boy is talking to you. Can't you hear?

678
00:45:19,583 --> 00:45:21,291
Please don’t trouble me.

679
00:45:21,583 --> 00:45:22,416
Trouble?

680
00:45:22,625 --> 00:45:24,083
I like you a lot.

681
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:26,458
Madam,

682
00:45:26,958 --> 00:45:28,083
he has gone crazy for you.

683
00:45:28,416 --> 00:45:30,041
Since that day he saw you in the bus stop,

684
00:45:30,333 --> 00:45:31,375
he talks only about you.

685
00:45:32,750 --> 00:45:34,250
Say something, Meera.

686
00:45:35,375 --> 00:45:36,625
See madam,

687
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,708
Our boy has hero like looks.

688
00:45:38,708 --> 00:45:39,708
Why don’t you accept him?

689
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,541
I can’t. Please.

690
00:45:42,791 --> 00:45:43,375
You can't?

691
00:45:43,375 --> 00:45:43,958
Why?

692
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:45,083
Hey Meera

693
00:45:45,083 --> 00:45:46,625
Say you are already engaged.

694
00:45:46,625 --> 00:45:47,916
Please be silent, Saaji.

695
00:45:48,375 --> 00:45:49,208
Engaged?

696
00:45:49,208 --> 00:45:50,833
Is your marriage fixed?

697
00:45:51,250 --> 00:45:52,166
No, not...

698
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:53,791
Jyo, stop. Don't talk about that here.

699
00:45:54,250 --> 00:45:55,708
Oh, is this about Madhu?

700
00:45:55,708 --> 00:45:56,250
No.

701
00:45:56,541 --> 00:45:57,708
Hey bro...

702
00:45:57,958 --> 00:45:59,208
He is a kid.

703
00:45:59,541 --> 00:46:01,208
You are at a different level from him, don't worry.

704
00:46:02,291 --> 00:46:04,125
Please give a thought about me.

705
00:46:04,666 --> 00:46:05,833
What happened?

706
00:46:05,833 --> 00:46:07,041
Nothing, uncle.

707
00:46:10,083 --> 00:46:12,083
*Auto Caption "Love is God" *

708
00:46:14,416 --> 00:46:16,416
Why did you have to mention about Madhu?

709
00:46:17,208 --> 00:46:19,125
Where did we?

710
00:46:19,666 --> 00:46:21,750
Then how does he know his name?

711
00:46:27,708 --> 00:46:29,333
*Phone rings*

712
00:46:33,083 --> 00:46:36,458
Hello can I talk to Meera?

713
00:46:37,833 --> 00:46:40,208
Sister, you have got a call.

714
00:46:52,250 --> 00:46:53,000
Hello

715
00:46:53,250 --> 00:46:53,750
Hello

716
00:46:55,250 --> 00:46:56,541
I will tell mom…

717
00:46:57,541 --> 00:46:58,208
Ding

718
00:46:59,333 --> 00:47:00,250
Hello…

719
00:47:01,416 --> 00:47:02,750
Just called

720
00:47:04,250 --> 00:47:05,833
Be careful Madhu.

721
00:47:06,208 --> 00:47:07,791
Why? What is the matter Ding?

722
00:47:08,791 --> 00:47:09,708
Nothing.

723
00:47:09,916 --> 00:47:11,541
Is someone around?

724
00:47:14,541 --> 00:47:15,125
Yeah.

725
00:47:15,708 --> 00:47:16,416
Ok...so...

726
00:47:18,125 --> 00:47:19,416
You gave the principal.

727
00:47:19,958 --> 00:47:20,958
When is the interest due?

728
00:47:22,541 --> 00:47:23,541
Never.

729
00:47:24,333 --> 00:47:24,750
Ok,

730
00:47:24,916 --> 00:47:26,208
I will give you the notes tomorrow.

731
00:47:26,916 --> 00:47:27,416
Hello…

732
00:47:29,166 --> 00:47:31,375
Who is it Meera, on the phone as you came home?

733
00:47:31,625 --> 00:47:32,500
Thanks aunty.

734
00:47:34,541 --> 00:47:35,500
It was Sowmya, Ma.

735
00:47:37,541 --> 00:47:40,625
Won't it disturb them if you keep getting calls like this.

736
00:47:41,375 --> 00:47:43,000
I thanked. Didn't I?

737
00:47:43,458 --> 00:47:45,291
Come let us make coffee.

738
00:47:45,666 --> 00:47:47,208
Bye Meera sister.

739
00:47:47,208 --> 00:47:47,666
Bye!

740
00:47:48,125 --> 00:47:49,750
It will be perfect for this weather.

741
00:47:53,166 --> 00:47:54,125
Let’s meet tomorrow.

742
00:47:54,125 --> 00:47:55,291
What time will you come?

743
00:47:55,958 --> 00:47:56,916
6:30.

744
00:47:57,166 --> 00:47:58,125
Why so early?

745
00:47:58,250 --> 00:47:59,375
Did you complete homework?

746
00:47:59,375 --> 00:47:59,791
No.

747
00:48:00,416 --> 00:48:01,500
Okay, bye.

748
00:48:03,625 --> 00:48:05,000
Can’t you go a bit late?

749
00:48:06,041 --> 00:48:07,666
What will I answer my mother?

750
00:48:08,916 --> 00:48:09,916
Cook something up.

751
00:48:11,416 --> 00:48:12,375
What to say?

752
00:48:13,166 --> 00:48:14,958
What a lazy person our Hindi teacher is.

753
00:48:15,375 --> 00:48:16,708
Let's see how everyone has written.

754
00:48:16,708 --> 00:48:17,916
Shut up Dhi!

755
00:48:17,958 --> 00:48:19,291
Teacher has trusted me with these.

756
00:48:19,666 --> 00:48:20,833
Add some good marks for me.

757
00:48:20,875 --> 00:48:21,958
Get lost all of you…

758
00:48:26,583 --> 00:48:27,708
What are you looking for?

759
00:48:28,125 --> 00:48:29,416
where is the Cuticura box?

760
00:48:29,791 --> 00:48:30,750
Why?

761
00:48:31,916 --> 00:48:32,833
I want it.

762
00:48:33,083 --> 00:48:34,416
That's what I am asking, why?

763
00:48:38,875 --> 00:48:40,250
Are you Madhu?

764
00:48:40,583 --> 00:48:41,125
Yes.

765
00:48:41,291 --> 00:48:42,833
Come, I need to talk to you.

766
00:48:43,750 --> 00:48:44,541
We can talk here.

767
00:48:44,791 --> 00:48:47,083
Not here. Come that side.

768
00:48:47,458 --> 00:48:48,750
Don’t, Madhu.

769
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,666
Nothing to worry…

770
00:48:52,750 --> 00:48:53,666
I will be back in two minutes.

771
00:49:09,291 --> 00:49:10,916
Meera, I will leave.

772
00:49:11,208 --> 00:49:14,166
Please Jyo, wait with me here.

773
00:49:14,583 --> 00:49:16,041
It is getting late Meera.

774
00:49:16,041 --> 00:49:17,958
I will be yelled at by my father.

775
00:49:18,666 --> 00:49:20,375
My mother too.

776
00:49:22,583 --> 00:49:25,958
Why am I to suffer because of you both?

777
00:49:26,583 --> 00:49:28,500
I get scolded for no reason.

778
00:49:35,833 --> 00:49:37,208
What happened, Madhu?

779
00:49:38,583 --> 00:49:40,041
Why did you tell them about me?

780
00:49:40,166 --> 00:49:41,666
Where did I tell?

781
00:49:42,041 --> 00:49:43,708
Then how did they get to know?

782
00:49:44,541 --> 00:49:46,291
I didn't sign up for this when I fell for you.

783
00:49:46,875 --> 00:49:48,125
I didn't need this. Did I?

784
00:49:50,166 --> 00:49:51,541
What did I do, Madhu?

785
00:49:51,833 --> 00:49:53,666
Is it my mistake if they follow me?

786
00:49:54,416 --> 00:49:55,750
Yes, Madhu, she did not...

787
00:49:55,750 --> 00:49:56,583
You shut up.

788
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,916
Madhu… Come let’s go.

789
00:50:10,541 --> 00:50:11,750
Let us leave it at this.

790
00:50:11,916 --> 00:50:13,791
Let us talk to your area boys.

791
00:50:13,958 --> 00:50:14,916
No man. Leave it.

792
00:50:17,041 --> 00:50:18,750
Can you stop and let me be?

793
00:50:19,291 --> 00:50:20,541
Just leave me alone.

794
00:50:24,041 --> 00:50:24,708
Hey…

795
00:50:25,416 --> 00:50:26,791
Don’t you want the Cuticura box?

796
00:50:35,708 --> 00:50:38,500
In cinema, the hero beats up the villains…

797
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:40,916
but my hero had been beaten up.

798
00:50:41,541 --> 00:50:45,125
Him saying ‘Let us leave it at this’ disappointed me.

799
00:50:46,166 --> 00:50:48,916
But I later realized, that he grew deeper into me..

800
00:50:48,916 --> 00:50:51,041
since then.

801
00:50:59,625 --> 00:51:02,958
It is easy to take a bunch of boys and indulge in a fight.

802
00:51:04,083 --> 00:51:06,416
But to let things go is difficult.

803
00:51:07,083 --> 00:51:08,541
Especially for boys.

804
00:51:32,125 --> 00:51:36,083
The same irresponsible attitude would have  
 irritated me earlier.

805
00:51:36,083 --> 00:51:39,041
*Note: I have not studied Ding, please pass me*

806
00:51:39,041 --> 00:51:40,208
But then...

807
00:51:43,166 --> 00:51:46,291
Was I making him lazy with my pamper?

808
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:47,833
I don't know.

809
00:51:48,458 --> 00:51:50,041
I couldn't help it but.

810
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:11,791
*Auto Caption: Loving Boy, Cheating Girl*

811
00:52:12,291 --> 00:52:14,625
I don’t know what happened during that fight.

812
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,833
But after that incident, the auto boys...

813
00:52:16,833 --> 00:52:18,541
...stopped following me.

814
00:52:28,041 --> 00:52:29,125
Bro, what happened?

815
00:52:29,791 --> 00:52:31,083
Nothing.

816
00:52:31,750 --> 00:52:33,125
I will go to class and be back.

817
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:34,625
He doesn’t know yet?

818
00:52:47,250 --> 00:52:50,416
Sometimes you fight and sometimes you talk...

819
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,333
It is beyond my understanding.

820
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:02,416
Bro, have you kept the money safely?

821
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:03,666
Yes bro.

822
00:53:04,166 --> 00:53:06,750
I had to beg and cry before my dad for it. That's why!

823
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:09,916
I am getting scared.

824
00:53:10,875 --> 00:53:12,166
It was the first time

825
00:53:12,166 --> 00:53:14,541
I skipped class to watch a movie with friends.

826
00:53:15,291 --> 00:53:16,958
DDLJ movie had released.

827
00:53:17,250 --> 00:53:18,875
It was the second time for all of us.

828
00:53:19,041 --> 00:53:21,208
Yet, we all wanted to watch it again.

829
00:53:23,541 --> 00:53:24,375
6 Balcony tickets.

830
00:53:24,458 --> 00:53:25,416
Haven’t you gone to the school?

831
00:53:25,416 --> 00:53:26,333
It’s a holiday.

832
00:53:26,333 --> 00:53:26,916
Why?

833
00:53:26,916 --> 00:53:27,958
Chairman died.

834
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:28,916
Which school?

835
00:53:29,208 --> 00:53:30,208
Ahhhh…Saint...

836
00:53:30,208 --> 00:53:30,750
Meera's...

837
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:32,416
Seats are not together.

838
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:33,541
Good, give.

839
00:53:36,750 --> 00:54:11,541
*Film playing in the theatre*

840
00:54:56,875 --> 00:54:57,750
Sorry.

841
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:29,541
Are you ok?

842
00:56:08,625 --> 00:56:09,833
Go check once Meera.

843
00:56:09,833 --> 00:56:11,333
Your lips are so chapped.

844
00:56:11,333 --> 00:56:12,833
Apply some lip balm.

845
00:56:16,833 --> 00:56:19,541
A secret gift from our secret world,

846
00:56:19,625 --> 00:56:20,958
Just OURS.

847
00:56:21,291 --> 00:56:22,750
Just US.

848
00:56:34,083 --> 00:56:35,625
How was the film?

849
00:56:35,666 --> 00:56:36,750
It was good.

850
00:56:36,750 --> 00:56:39,125
Amazing, isn’t it?

851
00:56:39,125 --> 00:56:41,000
Hey, we will go to bathroom and join you.

852
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,083
Will you come along?

853
00:56:42,083 --> 00:56:43,166
See you in the classroom later.

854
00:56:43,166 --> 00:56:44,250
Ok, bye.

855
00:56:44,916 --> 00:56:46,333
Bro, Kajol...

856
00:56:47,041 --> 00:56:48,833
Who Kajol?

857
00:56:48,833 --> 00:56:50,166
That thing which apply to your eyes...

858
00:56:50,166 --> 00:56:52,083
Hey shut up man, don't tease...

859
00:56:52,083 --> 00:56:54,250
What's up Madhu? Your lips are swollen?

860
00:56:54,250 --> 00:56:55,625
Nothing man, just...

861
00:56:55,625 --> 00:56:57,083
They had corner seats as well...

862
00:56:57,666 --> 00:56:58,958
Hey Ding.

863
00:56:59,083 --> 00:57:00,875
Hey...What happened?

864
00:57:01,541 --> 00:57:02,708
How did they get to know?

865
00:57:02,958 --> 00:57:03,750
What?

866
00:57:07,916 --> 00:57:09,333
I didn't say anything.

867
00:57:09,750 --> 00:57:11,000
This idiot Prajwal....

868
00:57:12,875 --> 00:57:13,375
Hey...

869
00:57:13,875 --> 00:57:16,583
Why do boys share everything with their friends?

870
00:57:16,708 --> 00:57:17,333
Bloody hell.

871
00:57:17,333 --> 00:57:18,625
It was our moment!

872
00:57:25,333 --> 00:57:26,541
*On Desk: Dagar (Slut)*

873
00:57:27,708 --> 00:57:28,500
Dagar (Slut)

874
00:57:37,041 --> 00:57:41,208
*On Desk: Dagar (Slut)*

875
00:57:50,791 --> 00:57:52,625
Why are you guys doing this to her?

876
00:57:52,625 --> 00:57:53,958
How does it concern you?

877
00:57:54,625 --> 00:57:57,000
She will feel hurt.

878
00:57:57,666 --> 00:57:58,500
Then what...?

879
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:00,291
She took the rose from our boy

880
00:58:00,291 --> 00:58:03,666
and now roams with Madhu. How can we tolerate?

881
00:58:04,125 --> 00:58:06,250
It has been two years since she took rose Babu.

882
00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:08,208
So what if it is 2 years?

883
00:58:08,625 --> 00:58:10,541
She likes him.

884
00:58:10,541 --> 00:58:12,375
She took rose from me as well, isn't it?

885
00:58:12,666 --> 00:58:14,625
Shame on me for talking to you.

886
00:58:14,708 --> 00:58:15,416
Come, Meera.

887
00:58:15,416 --> 00:58:16,458
Get lost.

888
00:58:17,916 --> 00:58:19,583
What were you talking to them?

889
00:58:19,916 --> 00:58:21,125
Just keep walking.

890
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:24,041
Jyo, What does 'dagar' mean?

891
00:58:24,041 --> 00:58:25,791
Meera, just walk silently.

892
00:58:44,791 --> 00:58:46,833
Are you leaving as soon as the bus arrives?

893
00:58:46,833 --> 00:58:48,041
Yes. Aren't you?

894
00:58:49,416 --> 00:58:51,333
Won’t you come with us even today?

895
00:58:51,791 --> 00:58:53,708
The class was too long today.

896
00:58:53,750 --> 00:58:55,500
Meera is standing there.

897
00:58:55,666 --> 00:58:56,208
Where bro?

898
00:58:56,291 --> 00:58:57,083
Slut.

899
00:59:01,458 --> 00:59:03,541
Where is your slut bro?

900
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:26,166
*News playing in TV*

901
00:59:26,166 --> 00:59:27,916
Won’t you change your clothes Meera?

902
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,791
I will ma. First, you tell me.

903
00:59:29,791 --> 00:59:31,333
I need to complete homework too.

904
00:59:32,541 --> 00:59:33,958
He was a good orator.

905
00:59:33,958 --> 00:59:37,625
He would mesmerize people with his speeches.

906
00:59:37,833 --> 00:59:40,250
World war occurred because of him.

907
00:59:41,916 --> 00:59:44,500
Millions of them died.

908
00:59:44,958 --> 00:59:46,958
What he did was wrong, isn’t it ma?

909
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:50,250
The whole of the world knows it as wrong.

910
00:59:50,875 --> 00:59:52,458
But what can be done?

911
00:59:53,208 --> 00:59:55,458
Hunger for power makes one do things.

912
00:59:56,958 --> 00:59:58,166
"Dagar dagar" (Song playing)

913
00:59:58,166 --> 01:00:01,375
"Dum dum dagar dagar..."(Song Playing)

914
01:00:01,375 --> 01:00:02,791
"Dagar dagar"

915
01:00:03,708 --> 01:00:07,666
“Dagar Dagar...Dum dum dagar dagar…”

916
01:00:11,541 --> 01:00:13,500
What kind of lyrics are they writing?

917
01:00:14,750 --> 01:00:16,750
Won’t they know it affects children?

918
01:00:17,125 --> 01:00:19,083
The world of cinema is getting corrupted.

919
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:20,791
That is when I understood

920
01:00:21,041 --> 01:00:22,958
the meaning of that word.

921
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:26,875
What had I done...so wrong, to be called like that?

922
01:00:34,125 --> 01:00:35,708
Bro, see there....

923
01:00:36,083 --> 01:00:36,750
Slut.

924
01:00:39,375 --> 01:00:44,333
How much ever she washes, nothing is going to change.

925
01:00:47,208 --> 01:00:49,125
He said he loved me.

926
01:00:49,583 --> 01:00:52,291
Is this what love means in his dictionary?

927
01:01:18,208 --> 01:01:21,750
Just because things didn't unfold the way he wanted to..

928
01:01:21,750 --> 01:01:25,625
it makes me a prostitute, is it?

929
01:01:35,625 --> 01:01:37,833
Why are these guys here?

930
01:01:39,166 --> 01:01:41,958
It seems she was staring this morning…

931
01:01:43,041 --> 01:01:44,083
Yeah.

932
01:01:44,083 --> 01:01:45,125
Who, bro?

933
01:01:45,208 --> 01:01:47,041
There will be such sluts man....

934
01:01:47,041 --> 01:01:48,583
They keep signaling through their eyes.

935
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:50,125
Hey, Babu,

936
01:01:50,125 --> 01:01:51,416
Why are you doing this?

937
01:01:52,166 --> 01:01:53,708
Why, Raju?

938
01:01:53,875 --> 01:01:55,833
You go man, mind your business.

939
01:02:03,958 --> 01:02:07,541
He always tries to interfere.

940
01:02:07,541 --> 01:02:10,500
Questions everything.

941
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:12,916
How should it matter to him?

942
01:02:12,916 --> 01:02:15,000
He thinks he is a loyal friend.

943
01:02:34,791 --> 01:02:36,375
Abdul, aren't you coming with us?

944
01:02:36,375 --> 01:02:37,666
Wait, I will join.

945
01:02:39,291 --> 01:02:40,083
Madhu,

946
01:02:40,083 --> 01:02:41,500
come this side, I need to talk.

947
01:02:41,833 --> 01:02:43,000
Tell me here, it’s ok.

948
01:02:43,250 --> 01:02:45,000
Come to the sides, please.

949
01:02:45,875 --> 01:02:47,791
What is with this secret bro code?

950
01:02:47,791 --> 01:02:49,500
Whatever it is, utter it here Abdul.

951
01:02:53,916 --> 01:02:54,958
Alright bro.

952
01:02:55,125 --> 01:02:56,291
In the boy's toilet, it's written

953
01:02:56,291 --> 01:02:57,916
Meera equals Slut.

954
01:03:05,583 --> 01:03:07,166
Where are you going?

955
01:03:08,333 --> 01:03:09,916
Don’t you want to do something?

956
01:03:10,375 --> 01:03:12,166
What can I do?

957
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:14,125
What do you expect from me?

958
01:03:19,416 --> 01:03:20,875
If someone says something,

959
01:03:21,416 --> 01:03:23,375
don’t you know who you are?

960
01:03:27,666 --> 01:03:28,916
What can I do?

961
01:03:29,750 --> 01:03:31,083
Go fight.

962
01:03:31,333 --> 01:03:33,958
In the movies the hero protects the heroine.

963
01:03:34,583 --> 01:03:35,708
But this boy…

964
01:03:38,583 --> 01:03:39,958
It is my battle.

965
01:03:42,500 --> 01:03:44,250
Mine alone.

966
01:04:16,458 --> 01:04:17,166
Slut.

967
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:18,708
Slut.

968
01:04:20,208 --> 01:04:22,041
There are such sluts bro...

969
01:04:22,708 --> 01:04:24,708
Why is it bothering me so much?

970
01:04:25,750 --> 01:04:26,541
That word.

971
01:04:27,750 --> 01:04:29,333
What is there in it?

972
01:04:41,541 --> 01:04:43,125
If someone says something....

973
01:04:43,625 --> 01:04:45,458
don't you know who you are?

974
01:04:58,041 --> 01:05:00,250
Not possible for 50 rupees.

975
01:05:00,916 --> 01:05:01,708
See.

976
01:05:01,958 --> 01:05:03,916
It dawned on me suddenly.

977
01:05:04,875 --> 01:05:07,083
The word after all means a prostitute...

978
01:05:07,083 --> 01:05:08,416
that's all, isn't it?

979
01:05:16,083 --> 01:05:18,041
Isn’t it a profession for some?

980
01:05:19,708 --> 01:05:21,416
Whether they like or not,

981
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:23,708
for a livelihood they have do it. Isn't it?

982
01:05:25,083 --> 01:05:27,333
Why should that word become a curse word?

983
01:05:27,750 --> 01:05:30,208
Who are these to call me so?

984
01:05:45,208 --> 01:05:47,500
Let us finish it today.

985
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:49,375
I have got sketch pens.

986
01:05:51,083 --> 01:05:52,958
We need to outline it with different colours

987
01:05:59,083 --> 01:06:01,541
Bro, how was it to fall on your dagar?

988
01:06:02,083 --> 01:06:03,833
They are so cheap.

989
01:06:39,708 --> 01:06:41,916
In the english debate competition,

990
01:06:41,916 --> 01:06:43,666
our last participant is

991
01:06:44,125 --> 01:06:46,791
Meera Deshpande from 10th 'B' Section.

992
01:06:49,166 --> 01:06:51,208
Bro, your slut is going. Won't you wish her all the best?

993
01:06:51,458 --> 01:06:54,000
I will be happy if she loses.

994
01:07:51,625 --> 01:07:52,875
You were too good Meera!

995
01:07:52,875 --> 01:07:54,125
You were super!

996
01:07:54,333 --> 01:07:55,125
What?

997
01:07:55,125 --> 01:07:57,208
They want to cancel their bet.

998
01:07:57,875 --> 01:07:58,666
What bet?

999
01:07:58,833 --> 01:07:59,625
With whom?

1000
01:08:00,041 --> 01:08:01,416
Madhu had a bet with them

1001
01:08:01,416 --> 01:08:02,583
saying you would win.

1002
01:08:05,625 --> 01:08:08,708
Debate competition results are with me!

1003
01:08:08,708 --> 01:08:12,166
I am really curious, are you?

1004
01:08:12,666 --> 01:08:14,916
Let’s see who the winner is.

1005
01:08:16,458 --> 01:08:19,333
It's my favourite Meera Deshpande

1006
01:08:19,458 --> 01:08:22,333
from 10th B section. Give her a big round of applause!

1007
01:08:52,625 --> 01:09:34,291
*Folk mystical song in praise of Lord Shiva*

1008
01:09:38,791 --> 01:09:41,208
It was my first school excursion.

1009
01:09:42,375 --> 01:09:45,916
I went out of the city with Madhu for the first time.

1010
01:09:47,291 --> 01:09:50,000
Although the place mattered less,

1011
01:09:50,791 --> 01:09:53,875
I did want to learn more about the place.

1012
01:09:54,333 --> 01:09:57,458
But he would divert my attention to something else

1013
01:10:02,166 --> 01:10:04,250
Ancient temples of Somnathpur

1014
01:10:05,250 --> 01:10:06,791
Sand dunes of Talakadu

1015
01:10:07,541 --> 01:10:11,375
were a silent witness to our tender yet passionate love.

1016
01:12:48,791 --> 01:12:53,166
"This earth is blushing"

1017
01:12:53,708 --> 01:12:58,666
"That sky is swaying"

1018
01:13:03,833 --> 01:13:10,041
"Steaming teenage"

1019
01:13:10,541 --> 01:13:15,250
"Dripping romance"

1020
01:13:19,250 --> 01:13:24,041
"Blossoming Lovers"

1021
01:13:24,041 --> 01:13:32,458
"Stones are melting"

1022
01:13:59,083 --> 01:14:00,500
Does anyone need water?

1023
01:14:05,041 --> 01:14:06,458
Take it, Madhu.

1024
01:14:07,375 --> 01:14:08,791
Madhu is always late isn't it?

1025
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:09,708
Meera?

1026
01:14:13,291 --> 01:14:14,041
Some more?

1027
01:14:14,666 --> 01:14:16,333
Enough? Shall I serve some more?

1028
01:14:16,625 --> 01:14:18,541
Some more? Serve them soup.

1029
01:14:38,500 --> 01:14:39,625
May we come in, sir?

1030
01:14:40,708 --> 01:14:41,708
Come, sit.

1031
01:14:48,666 --> 01:14:50,083
Please sit

1032
01:15:11,833 --> 01:15:12,916
Enjoyed the trip?

1033
01:15:18,666 --> 01:15:19,916
I like you both as a couple.

1034
01:15:20,458 --> 01:15:21,500
Thank you, sir.

1035
01:15:26,958 --> 01:15:29,208
You do know you are my favourite student, right?

1036
01:15:31,208 --> 01:15:33,583
The entire school has pinned hopes on you.

1037
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:35,708
Sir…

1038
01:15:38,458 --> 01:15:40,125
What year are you in now? Tell me?

1039
01:15:41,375 --> 01:15:42,375
Board exams.

1040
01:15:43,333 --> 01:15:44,916
Just two months away from the exams.

1041
01:15:45,583 --> 01:15:47,166
Please concentrate on your studies.

1042
01:15:47,541 --> 01:15:48,916
Two months is a lot, sir.

1043
01:15:49,083 --> 01:15:50,333
Will prepare well.

1044
01:15:50,458 --> 01:15:51,500
Don't worry at all.

1045
01:15:52,166 --> 01:15:53,583
Marks are not showered from the sky, Madhu.

1046
01:15:54,416 --> 01:15:55,500
Be serious.

1047
01:15:57,625 --> 01:15:58,833
After you graduate,

1048
01:15:59,208 --> 01:16:00,541
you can marry, you both.

1049
01:16:00,708 --> 01:16:01,666
Marriage?

1050
01:16:04,791 --> 01:16:06,041
If you get a good job,

1051
01:16:06,458 --> 01:16:08,083
it will make life easy for you two.

1052
01:16:08,416 --> 01:16:09,583
Give it a thought.

1053
01:16:10,541 --> 01:16:11,833
You guys need to slow down.

1054
01:16:14,125 --> 01:16:15,708
If something goes wrong,

1055
01:16:16,500 --> 01:16:18,291
it will affect you more than him.

1056
01:16:20,833 --> 01:16:21,583
Right?

1057
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:26,208
Go, all the best.

1058
01:16:27,875 --> 01:16:28,791
Thank you, sir.

1059
01:16:31,791 --> 01:16:33,125
Sorry, sir

1060
01:16:34,458 --> 01:16:35,416
Bye, sir.

1061
01:16:38,958 --> 01:16:40,500
We can easily prepare well, isn't it?

1062
01:16:40,833 --> 01:16:43,541
I wasn't sure why he said what he said.

1063
01:16:43,541 --> 01:16:48,000
But I didn't want to disappoint him or anybody else.

1064
01:17:08,250 --> 01:17:09,416
Meera sister…

1065
01:17:09,750 --> 01:17:10,791
Where is the chocolate?

1066
01:17:11,166 --> 01:17:12,125
Has someone called?

1067
01:17:12,250 --> 01:17:13,583
I don’t know.

1068
01:17:13,875 --> 01:17:15,500
Hey, tell me, is there a call?

1069
01:17:15,541 --> 01:17:16,666
All I need is a chocolate.

1070
01:17:16,666 --> 01:17:17,291
Just come fast.

1071
01:17:21,541 --> 01:17:23,125
Hi, uncle.

1072
01:17:23,375 --> 01:17:24,375
Did you have lunch Uncle?

1073
01:17:24,375 --> 01:17:25,375
Yes kid, I did, did you?

1074
01:17:25,750 --> 01:17:27,333
Not yet, uncle

1075
01:17:28,791 --> 01:17:29,583
Hello?

1076
01:17:30,375 --> 01:17:31,833
Why haven’t you eaten yet?

1077
01:17:32,375 --> 01:17:34,541
I was solving old question papers.

1078
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:35,958
Will go eat now.

1079
01:17:36,625 --> 01:17:38,041
It’s a week since we met Ding,

1080
01:17:38,708 --> 01:17:40,166
Since study holidays started,

1081
01:17:40,416 --> 01:17:42,166
you have not stepped out of the house.

1082
01:17:42,708 --> 01:17:44,416
How do we survive like this?

1083
01:17:45,541 --> 01:17:47,458
I will come to the library tomorrow.

1084
01:17:48,291 --> 01:17:49,625
Whenever you speak from home,

1085
01:17:49,791 --> 01:17:51,541
you seem like a different person.

1086
01:17:52,625 --> 01:17:54,208
Uncle is close by.

1087
01:17:54,833 --> 01:17:55,750
Can’t hear.

1088
01:17:56,333 --> 01:17:57,041
Idiot.

1089
01:17:57,041 --> 01:17:58,458
Will meet you tomorrow. Bye.

1090
01:18:00,083 --> 01:18:01,166
Thank you, uncle.

1091
01:18:01,166 --> 01:18:02,250
It's ok. Welcome.

1092
01:18:02,250 --> 01:18:03,750
Since it is exam time, friends call…

1093
01:18:03,750 --> 01:18:05,375
Yes, I understand. Study well.

1094
01:18:05,375 --> 01:18:06,458
Bye, uncle.

1095
01:18:07,666 --> 01:18:08,416
Sister, my chocolate?

1096
01:18:08,416 --> 01:18:10,000
You shouldn’t eat chocolates kiddo.

1097
01:18:10,083 --> 01:18:11,333
Your teeth will get infected.

1098
01:18:31,958 --> 01:18:33,291
I am not going to major in Science next year...

1099
01:18:33,291 --> 01:18:34,625
I just decided.

1100
01:18:39,458 --> 01:18:41,291
Even I don't want to.

1101
01:18:41,291 --> 01:18:44,208
I wish to major in Arts and study Psychology.

1102
01:18:44,541 --> 01:18:46,625
Will your mother agree?

1103
01:18:46,875 --> 01:18:48,000
No way.

1104
01:18:48,458 --> 01:18:51,083
My parents see only engineering as an option for me.

1105
01:18:56,416 --> 01:18:58,208
Nobody is watching.

1106
01:19:00,083 --> 01:19:04,041
You were saying something about equal and opposite reaction…

1107
01:19:04,958 --> 01:19:06,541
Focus on studies…

1108
01:19:23,416 --> 01:19:24,875
Madhu, concentrate.

1109
01:19:24,875 --> 01:19:26,666
I am. You continue.

1110
01:19:28,708 --> 01:19:30,375
How do we study like this?

1111
01:19:30,708 --> 01:19:32,083
What can I do?

1112
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,750
When I am with you my hands refuse to listen to me.

1113
01:19:38,125 --> 01:19:39,416
Exams are nearing.

1114
01:19:40,958 --> 01:19:42,500
Let us not meet from tomorrow.

1115
01:19:43,375 --> 01:19:44,666
Would that be easy?

1116
01:19:46,750 --> 01:19:48,500
I feel like dying when I don't see you.

1117
01:19:49,791 --> 01:19:50,958
Then?

1118
01:19:51,833 --> 01:19:53,291
I don’t know.

1119
01:19:57,083 --> 01:19:59,208
Shall we go for a movie?

1120
01:20:00,708 --> 01:20:03,250
Baby, we have exams next week, have you forgotten?

1121
01:20:04,083 --> 01:20:04,708
No.

1122
01:20:14,500 --> 01:20:16,916
Even I am trying for higher studies.

1123
01:20:16,916 --> 01:20:19,875
But at home, they say enough of studies.

1124
01:20:19,875 --> 01:20:21,958
Don’t know what to do.

1125
01:20:23,291 --> 01:20:24,416
Get married.

1126
01:20:24,416 --> 01:20:26,125
That is my fear too.

1127
01:20:26,125 --> 01:20:28,916
My father has been looking for groom from many years.

1128
01:20:32,125 --> 01:20:34,125
You people are laughing?

1129
01:20:36,166 --> 01:20:38,250
I will try to join Christ College.

1130
01:20:39,250 --> 01:20:40,458
I will join diploma.

1131
01:20:40,458 --> 01:20:41,750
I will make money faster.

1132
01:20:41,958 --> 01:20:45,250
My dad says diploma holders do not have status.

1133
01:20:45,666 --> 01:20:46,833
Let him think.

1134
01:20:47,666 --> 01:20:48,833
Let us elope and get married.

1135
01:20:49,166 --> 01:20:51,125
Who will marry you?

1136
01:20:51,250 --> 01:20:53,458
You wait and see, I will be the one for you.

1137
01:20:53,916 --> 01:20:55,500
What about you, Madhu?

1138
01:20:55,916 --> 01:20:57,583
I will join where my girl will join.

1139
01:20:57,583 --> 01:20:59,541
First let him get his hall ticket.

1140
01:20:59,541 --> 01:21:01,041
Why will I not get it?

1141
01:21:01,041 --> 01:21:02,791
Bro, what will you do now?

1142
01:21:02,916 --> 01:21:04,666
I have spoken to my cousin.

1143
01:21:04,666 --> 01:21:06,541
He said he will help me out.

1144
01:21:07,208 --> 01:21:07,958
Let's see.

1145
01:21:08,541 --> 01:21:10,291
Let us leave if you are done.

1146
01:21:10,291 --> 01:21:11,791
Crowd would be less near the counter.

1147
01:21:12,541 --> 01:21:14,583
Ok, finish up with the cigarette fast.

1148
01:21:15,458 --> 01:21:18,625
We didn't realize that those were the last days of school.

1149
01:21:19,625 --> 01:21:22,125
I sort of knew things won't remain the same.

1150
01:21:22,583 --> 01:21:27,291
But didn't know how different it would be.

1151
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:30,958
Students,

1152
01:21:30,958 --> 01:21:32,375
just focus on your own booklet,

1153
01:21:32,375 --> 01:21:34,541
need not look here and there.

1154
01:21:37,208 --> 01:21:38,500
I had forgotten

1155
01:21:39,125 --> 01:21:41,375
whether I had started liking Madhu because of Salman

1156
01:21:41,375 --> 01:21:44,125
or I like Salman now because of Madhu.

1157
01:21:45,125 --> 01:21:47,041
I couldn’t stick Madhu’s photo.

1158
01:21:47,333 --> 01:21:48,750
So...

1159
01:22:44,875 --> 01:22:46,625
Bro, I will surely pass says this flower.

1160
01:22:47,291 --> 01:22:48,916
Do you have to go?

1161
01:22:50,583 --> 01:22:53,375
He wants me to go to my uncle's village and learn some work.

1162
01:22:53,375 --> 01:22:55,333
I can't say no, isn't it?

1163
01:22:55,458 --> 01:22:56,458
Whatever...

1164
01:22:56,458 --> 01:22:57,458
Do what you wish.

1165
01:22:57,500 --> 01:22:59,208
I promise I will call you from there.

1166
01:22:59,625 --> 01:23:01,250
Two months, Madhu!

1167
01:23:01,833 --> 01:23:05,125
I will write letters daily and send it by pigeons, ok?

1168
01:23:05,416 --> 01:23:08,041
*Sings song*

1169
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:09,250
Bye.

1170
01:23:09,875 --> 01:23:11,166
Hey Ding...

1171
01:23:11,166 --> 01:23:12,750
What happened to her man?

1172
01:23:12,750 --> 01:23:14,333
Meera...Meera...

1173
01:23:14,375 --> 01:23:15,875
Please don't get angry. Come back.

1174
01:23:16,458 --> 01:23:18,208
Come ding, it was such a small...

1175
01:23:18,208 --> 01:23:21,125
See, they have planned some things for last day...

1176
01:23:36,208 --> 01:23:37,500
Meera.

1177
01:23:37,500 --> 01:23:38,791
Wake up baby.

1178
01:23:40,958 --> 01:23:42,708
It's already 9 in the morning.

1179
01:23:43,458 --> 01:23:46,250
One shouldn’t sleep for so long. It is inauspicious.

1180
01:23:49,208 --> 01:23:50,625
Did you wake up?

1181
01:23:54,458 --> 01:23:55,791
I have cooked.

1182
01:23:55,791 --> 01:23:57,625
Do have lunch. Don’t forget.

1183
01:23:58,333 --> 01:24:00,500
I am leaving.

1184
01:24:03,083 --> 01:24:06,166
I didn't know I will have to be without Madhu like this.

1185
01:24:10,791 --> 01:24:12,291
I didn't know there would be a day when

1186
01:24:12,291 --> 01:24:13,791
I don't get to see him.

1187
01:24:14,208 --> 01:24:17,041
*Wall graffitti: Madhu Tailors*

1188
01:24:17,125 --> 01:24:18,541
How do I live without him?

1189
01:24:18,541 --> 01:24:19,583
Was it even possible?

1190
01:24:19,958 --> 01:24:21,250
I didn't know.

1191
01:24:27,958 --> 01:24:30,500
That is when I got introduced to loneliness.

1192
01:24:34,458 --> 01:24:35,583
That is when I realized

1193
01:24:35,958 --> 01:24:38,583
how deeply he had rooted within me.

1194
01:24:43,208 --> 01:24:45,583
Every passing moment was heavy.

1195
01:24:47,083 --> 01:24:49,625
Every breath of mine longed for him.

1196
01:24:51,666 --> 01:24:54,291
Not a single phone call did I get from him.

1197
01:24:55,041 --> 01:24:57,041
Didn't he ever remember me?

1198
01:24:59,875 --> 01:25:01,375
That's when I realized,

1199
01:25:01,833 --> 01:25:04,666
we experience only our own feelings.

1200
01:25:05,791 --> 01:25:07,958
That is our only truth.

1201
01:25:09,291 --> 01:25:13,083
We can only understand others feelings and thoughts,

1202
01:25:13,083 --> 01:25:15,833
but can't experience them.

1203
01:25:19,083 --> 01:25:21,083
He said he loved me.

1204
01:25:21,958 --> 01:25:24,291
Is this what love means to him?

1205
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:29,333
Is he able to stay without talking to me for so long?

1206
01:25:30,333 --> 01:25:32,125
Did he forget me?

1207
01:25:44,916 --> 01:25:45,583
Meera!

1208
01:25:45,583 --> 01:25:46,791
Congrats Meera.

1209
01:25:46,791 --> 01:25:47,791
Thanks, Jyo.

1210
01:25:51,166 --> 01:25:52,458
Congrats, Meera.

1211
01:25:52,458 --> 01:25:53,375
Thanks!

1212
01:25:53,541 --> 01:25:54,291
Hmm...Ma....

1213
01:25:54,666 --> 01:25:55,833
Congratulations, Meera!

1214
01:25:55,833 --> 01:25:57,083
Eighty nine percent.

1215
01:25:57,375 --> 01:25:58,125
Very good.

1216
01:25:58,791 --> 01:26:01,083
Keep talking, I will meet the Principal and be back.

1217
01:26:01,333 --> 01:26:02,458
Where is Madhu?

1218
01:26:03,208 --> 01:26:04,416
He is there.

1219
01:26:18,625 --> 01:26:19,833
Hi.

1220
01:26:21,041 --> 01:26:22,541
How are you?

1221
01:26:30,291 --> 01:26:32,375
Sorry Ding. Couldn’t call.

1222
01:26:32,541 --> 01:26:34,416
Phone lines in our village were disrupted.

1223
01:26:57,750 --> 01:26:59,333
I failed, Meera.

1224
01:27:06,708 --> 01:27:08,208
Don’t know how.

1225
01:27:10,125 --> 01:27:12,083
I had done well in all the subjects.

1226
01:27:13,166 --> 01:27:14,500
But this one...

1227
01:27:18,250 --> 01:27:19,333
Look at this man.

1228
01:27:19,958 --> 01:27:21,458
He copied my answers

1229
01:27:21,833 --> 01:27:23,458
but he passed.

1230
01:27:24,500 --> 01:27:26,333
You will pass in the re-exams, don't worry.

1231
01:27:29,666 --> 01:27:31,416
Yes, I will clear it then.

1232
01:27:34,500 --> 01:27:35,750
Hey, congrats,

1233
01:27:36,291 --> 01:27:37,750
You have topped. Isn’t it?

1234
01:27:46,916 --> 01:27:49,875
Mom will create drama.

1235
01:27:50,708 --> 01:27:52,375
How do I go home?

1236
01:27:54,791 --> 01:27:58,250
Dad will for sure…kill me.

1237
01:28:09,666 --> 01:28:11,958
I am not that dumb, am I?

1238
01:28:22,458 --> 01:28:24,791
I will pass in re-exams. Won't I, Meera?

1239
01:28:30,250 --> 01:28:31,583
I missed you Meera!

1240
01:29:25,333 --> 01:29:27,875
Nobody is to be seen? Did you skip the class?

1241
01:29:27,875 --> 01:29:31,416
Don’t skip too many classes. Else you will become like me!

1242
01:29:36,083 --> 01:29:37,375
Where do we sit?

1243
01:29:37,833 --> 01:29:39,500
Come here. It’s empty here.

1244
01:29:40,916 --> 01:29:44,708
It was different meeting him outside school.

1245
01:29:44,875 --> 01:29:47,625
Our worlds had changed.

1246
01:29:50,291 --> 01:29:53,583
But he was still the emperor of my world.

1247
01:29:54,333 --> 01:29:55,000
Cauliflower fry.

1248
01:29:55,708 --> 01:29:57,000
Also one fried rice.

1249
01:29:59,291 --> 01:30:00,291
Then, what else?

1250
01:30:01,375 --> 01:30:02,166
What else?

1251
01:30:02,750 --> 01:30:04,291
We met just the other day.

1252
01:30:06,041 --> 01:30:07,416
What's up with you?

1253
01:30:09,208 --> 01:30:10,666
Its all a bit strange Ding.

1254
01:30:11,083 --> 01:30:12,708
I am unable to understand anything.

1255
01:30:17,125 --> 01:30:20,000
How did you become a topper despite being with me?

1256
01:30:26,416 --> 01:30:28,541
I am not worthy of you, isn’t it?

1257
01:30:34,208 --> 01:30:36,083
I am a loser who repeats exams.

1258
01:30:37,458 --> 01:30:38,958
And you are highly intelligent.

1259
01:30:40,416 --> 01:30:42,083
Wonder why you fell for me?

1260
01:30:42,875 --> 01:30:44,916
If I remember what is taught in the class,

1261
01:30:44,916 --> 01:30:46,666
is it my fault, Madhu?

1262
01:30:47,458 --> 01:30:49,625
I didn't like you because of your marks sheet.

1263
01:30:49,875 --> 01:30:51,250
What else did you see?

1264
01:30:53,166 --> 01:30:55,583
Why are you talking rubbish?

1265
01:31:01,541 --> 01:31:02,333
Sorry.

1266
01:31:04,500 --> 01:31:05,666
I said sorry.

1267
01:31:31,875 --> 01:31:32,583
Hi Ding.

1268
01:31:34,166 --> 01:31:35,041
Who were they?

1269
01:31:35,500 --> 01:31:36,291
Area boys.

1270
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:39,166
They look like goons.

1271
01:31:39,750 --> 01:31:40,250
Yes.

1272
01:31:42,333 --> 01:31:43,416
Are you here from a long time?

1273
01:31:43,875 --> 01:31:44,708
Look here.

1274
01:31:48,166 --> 01:31:50,583
What do I do sitting at home? I get bored.

1275
01:31:51,750 --> 01:31:53,625
All my friends go to college.

1276
01:31:53,791 --> 01:31:56,041
If you get bored, I will give you my books, Study them.

1277
01:31:56,750 --> 01:31:57,541
Show off?

1278
01:31:57,791 --> 01:32:00,125
That you are senior to me in studies?

1279
01:32:00,208 --> 01:32:03,333
I am stupid..and I should study for next year from now on!!?

1280
01:32:03,333 --> 01:32:04,625
Where did I say that, Madhu?

1281
01:32:04,875 --> 01:32:05,666
What else?

1282
01:32:05,666 --> 01:32:08,333
At home, mom tortures me. Here, you do the same.

1283
01:32:08,916 --> 01:32:10,166
Madhu, stay back.

1284
01:32:10,750 --> 01:32:12,416
I can't stay home or come here.

1285
01:32:12,666 --> 01:32:14,000
She also says the same things.

1286
01:32:14,666 --> 01:32:16,125
If study from now, will I become a genius?

1287
01:32:16,125 --> 01:32:19,125
As though getting good marks was my crime,

1288
01:32:19,125 --> 01:32:22,541
he would taunt and hurt me at every occasion.

1289
01:32:28,166 --> 01:32:30,958
Such moments, I wanted to embrace him like a child

1290
01:32:30,958 --> 01:32:33,416
and protect him from the world.

1291
01:32:38,916 --> 01:32:41,250
But he was making it very difficult.

1292
01:32:41,875 --> 01:32:44,208
There is an english essay as well

1293
01:32:47,041 --> 01:32:50,000
We just have a day off, I'm not going to finish it.

1294
01:32:50,416 --> 01:32:53,375
Shilpa, you carry on, see you later.

1295
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:55,333
You are hurting me.

1296
01:34:04,916 --> 01:34:06,583
Let's go study.

1297
01:34:06,708 --> 01:34:07,791
Just a minute.

1298
01:34:10,583 --> 01:34:11,500
Now.

1299
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:18,666
I will join some other college.

1300
01:34:18,958 --> 01:34:22,708
It won't be nice to be your junior in the same college.

1301
01:34:23,083 --> 01:34:24,958
It will be sexy...

1302
01:34:25,375 --> 01:34:27,500
to have an affair with a junior?

1303
01:34:27,625 --> 01:34:29,625
It makes me feel like a big girl.

1304
01:34:29,833 --> 01:34:30,708
Yes, madam.

1305
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:32,041
You are a big person.

1306
01:34:32,500 --> 01:34:34,083
Where you are and where am I?

1307
01:34:35,708 --> 01:34:36,500
No, Madhu.

1308
01:34:36,958 --> 01:34:38,583
Don't go on that tangent again!

1309
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:39,875
No, sweetheart.

1310
01:34:48,208 --> 01:34:48,791
Here.

1311
01:34:49,125 --> 01:34:50,750
Focus this side.

1312
01:35:11,416 --> 01:35:12,458
What?

1313
01:35:15,375 --> 01:35:17,208
Let’s ask for revaluation.

1314
01:35:18,958 --> 01:35:20,083
Why?

1315
01:35:26,875 --> 01:35:28,708
You have failed by four marks.

1316
01:35:36,416 --> 01:35:39,000
I was confident of clearing it this time.

1317
01:35:40,416 --> 01:35:42,000
Am I this stupid?

1318
01:35:46,250 --> 01:35:47,166
All because of you.

1319
01:35:48,625 --> 01:35:50,416
I was fine before you came into my life.

1320
01:35:50,583 --> 01:35:52,208
What did I do, Madhu?

1321
01:35:57,208 --> 01:35:57,791
Sorry.

1322
01:35:58,375 --> 01:35:59,000
Sorry.

1323
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:03,458
I didn't mean that.

1324
01:36:05,125 --> 01:36:08,208
You are the best gift from life.

1325
01:36:13,291 --> 01:36:14,166
I don't know.

1326
01:36:17,500 --> 01:36:18,458
My father…

1327
01:36:20,041 --> 01:36:20,833
mother…

1328
01:36:23,208 --> 01:36:24,000
My Sister..

1329
01:36:24,416 --> 01:36:26,041
...she doesn't even respect me.

1330
01:36:29,500 --> 01:36:30,666
Madhu, please.

1331
01:36:31,083 --> 01:36:32,458
Please don't cry.

1332
01:36:38,833 --> 01:36:39,625
Da......

1333
01:36:42,208 --> 01:36:44,166
Dad, this morning, happily....

1334
01:36:47,416 --> 01:36:50,416
was filling my application for a Diploma.

1335
01:36:52,333 --> 01:36:53,416
Madhu, please!

1336
01:36:53,750 --> 01:36:57,041
Let's send it for revaluation, You will clear it for sure.

1337
01:36:58,333 --> 01:36:59,625
Do you remember?

1338
01:37:00,208 --> 01:37:01,791
Our Principal would always say,

1339
01:37:02,666 --> 01:37:03,833
if you get first class,

1340
01:37:04,916 --> 01:37:06,083
you will get first class life.

1341
01:37:07,208 --> 01:37:08,750
If you get second class,

1342
01:37:10,291 --> 01:37:11,708
second class life.

1343
01:37:15,625 --> 01:37:16,833
If you fail...

1344
01:37:16,833 --> 01:37:19,708
Madhu, why are you taking him seriously?

1345
01:37:20,333 --> 01:37:22,375
I have failed again, Meera!

1346
01:37:27,750 --> 01:37:29,041
Don’t leave me.

1347
01:37:29,166 --> 01:37:31,208
I am right here.

1348
01:37:40,416 --> 01:37:42,333
I am not that stupid Meera.

1349
01:37:57,875 --> 01:37:59,708
Will you be fine?

1350
01:37:59,708 --> 01:38:02,083
Yes Ding. You Go. It's ok.

1351
01:38:03,583 --> 01:38:05,083
Shall we call Dheeraj?

1352
01:38:05,083 --> 01:38:07,666
Hey, No. I will manage.

1353
01:38:08,416 --> 01:38:10,208
Shall I come home with you?

1354
01:38:10,875 --> 01:38:12,333
What will you say coming home?

1355
01:38:12,666 --> 01:38:15,166
Shall I introduce you as their daughter in law?

1356
01:38:25,875 --> 01:38:27,125
I love you.

1357
01:38:28,833 --> 01:38:29,500
So much.

1358
01:38:42,208 --> 01:38:43,541
Take care.

1359
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:45,916
See you tomorrow.

1360
01:39:06,708 --> 01:39:08,458
Pull it.

1361
01:39:08,458 --> 01:39:10,208
Yes sir, wait, I am pulling it.

1362
01:39:11,250 --> 01:39:13,833
Careful with the antenna. It belongs to our neighbour.

1363
01:39:13,833 --> 01:39:15,083
Yes, I know.

1364
01:39:15,208 --> 01:39:16,500
Or else they will quarrel.

1365
01:39:16,708 --> 01:39:18,583
I will take care of it.

1366
01:39:19,208 --> 01:39:20,708
Do your work properly.

1367
01:39:20,833 --> 01:39:21,458
Kiddo!

1368
01:39:22,125 --> 01:39:23,000
Hey kiddo!

1369
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:24,208
Done with classes for the day?

1370
01:39:24,375 --> 01:39:25,208
How is it?

1371
01:39:25,333 --> 01:39:26,750
We got a new phone at our place.

1372
01:39:27,083 --> 01:39:28,625
Share the number with all your friends.

1373
01:39:29,041 --> 01:39:29,541
Ok, pa.

1374
01:39:29,541 --> 01:39:30,875
Don’t trouble the neighbours hereafter.

1375
01:39:31,500 --> 01:39:32,750
Pull it…pull it…pull it…

1376
01:39:32,750 --> 01:39:34,041
If we pull it further, wire will break.

1377
01:39:34,250 --> 01:39:37,041
We have waited for three years for this phone.

1378
01:39:37,041 --> 01:39:37,416
Ok, ok fine.

1379
01:39:39,416 --> 01:39:41,500
*Phone rings*

1380
01:39:43,541 --> 01:39:44,333
Hello?

1381
01:39:46,541 --> 01:39:47,291
Hello?

1382
01:39:47,916 --> 01:39:49,583
Who is it kiddo, at this hour?

1383
01:39:49,916 --> 01:39:50,583
I don't know.

1384
01:39:51,833 --> 01:39:54,416
Must be a cross connection.

1385
01:39:55,333 --> 01:39:57,333
You sleep. Why are you up so late?

1386
01:40:08,583 --> 01:40:10,666
Ma, you have forgotten to light the stove.

1387
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:15,708
Hello?

1388
01:40:16,875 --> 01:40:17,708
One minute.

1389
01:40:17,708 --> 01:40:18,500
Meera,

1390
01:40:18,625 --> 01:40:20,625
you have got a call.

1391
01:40:22,541 --> 01:40:24,125
Did you see, Archana?

1392
01:40:24,125 --> 01:40:25,000
Home?

1393
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:26,791
Already boys have started to call.

1394
01:40:26,958 --> 01:40:27,875
Ok, I will come.

1395
01:40:28,208 --> 01:40:29,916
Need to be careful henceforth.

1396
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,500
Does he stay so far?

1397
01:40:38,500 --> 01:40:41,458
Yesterday I told him that I will come home, he said no.

1398
01:40:41,458 --> 01:40:44,000
Today he has asked you to bring me along.

1399
01:40:45,208 --> 01:40:47,500
Off late I am not able to understand him.

1400
01:40:51,250 --> 01:40:53,083
I feel strange Dhee.

1401
01:40:54,125 --> 01:40:56,083
Wonder what his parents will think?

1402
01:40:56,083 --> 01:40:57,666
Tell him I will meet him tomorrow.

1403
01:44:53,583 --> 01:44:55,458
But Meera...

1404
01:45:08,333 --> 01:45:10,791
We finally got it after three years of wait.

1405
01:45:10,791 --> 01:45:12,500
How much did it cost you?

1406
01:45:13,541 --> 01:45:15,875
280 rupees was installation charges.

1407
01:45:16,625 --> 01:45:19,291
It seems they add some charges in the first bill.

1408
01:46:42,041 --> 01:46:44,375
Pratima, You dance well isn’t it?

1409
01:46:44,375 --> 01:46:46,458
Ma’m, I am not interested in competitions.

1410
01:46:46,458 --> 01:46:48,000
Why?

1411
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:49,375
Ma’m…

1412
01:46:49,583 --> 01:46:51,333
Meera, what happened?

1413
01:47:27,583 --> 01:47:29,000
How can he go like this?

1414
01:47:30,458 --> 01:47:32,291
How could he become so selfish?

1415
01:47:33,833 --> 01:47:35,750
Dad, Mom, Sister...

1416
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,000
Did he not think of any of them?

1417
01:47:38,208 --> 01:47:39,583
Was he so weak?

1418
01:47:48,625 --> 01:47:50,750
Just because of an exam result?

1419
01:47:51,833 --> 01:47:53,583
Why did he do this?

1420
01:47:54,583 --> 01:47:56,083
Where did he go to?

1421
01:48:31,791 --> 01:48:33,458
What does death mean?

1422
01:48:35,250 --> 01:48:37,333
He said he loved me!

1423
01:48:39,250 --> 01:48:44,541
Had he loved me, would he have left me? Just like that?

1424
01:48:46,791 --> 01:48:48,458
I need to talk to him

1425
01:48:48,833 --> 01:48:50,166
Right here, right now.

1426
01:48:51,166 --> 01:48:52,416
Just once.

1427
01:48:53,083 --> 01:48:54,416
I want to touch him.

1428
01:48:56,500 --> 01:48:57,750
Madhu.

1429
01:49:11,625 --> 01:49:12,750
While going...

1430
01:49:12,958 --> 01:49:15,333
he took me with him in many ways...

1431
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:26,250
Many a times

1432
01:49:26,708 --> 01:49:28,750
I contemplate killing myself too,

1433
01:49:31,541 --> 01:49:32,875
but I can’t.

1434
01:49:35,041 --> 01:49:37,916
I will keep breathing until I have to.

1435
01:49:38,166 --> 01:49:39,500
That's it!

1436
01:49:54,791 --> 01:49:56,208
it is in the newspapers, see.

1437
01:49:56,583 --> 01:49:57,875
Is this what you were talking about?

1438
01:49:57,875 --> 01:49:58,416
Yes.

1439
01:49:58,791 --> 01:49:59,583
What, Meera?

1440
01:50:00,458 --> 01:50:02,166
Meera, you came so early.

1441
01:50:02,541 --> 01:50:04,166
I can’t even cry.

1442
01:50:05,208 --> 01:50:08,583
If I cry, I am scared that I will lose him with tears.

1443
01:50:09,500 --> 01:50:10,875
I want him..

1444
01:50:11,250 --> 01:50:13,916
He should be here within me like this,

1445
01:50:14,041 --> 01:50:15,541
Safely!

1446
01:50:45,625 --> 01:50:46,208
Meera…

1447
01:50:47,125 --> 01:50:47,833
Meera…

1448
01:50:48,958 --> 01:50:49,708
Pass.

1449
01:50:50,958 --> 01:50:52,708
Don’t you want to check yours?

1450
01:50:55,708 --> 01:50:56,541
Meera?

1451
01:50:57,208 --> 01:50:58,333
Can we go for coffee?

1452
01:50:58,666 --> 01:51:00,083
I have been asking you for three years.

1453
01:51:00,500 --> 01:51:01,458
Today is our last day.

1454
01:51:01,666 --> 01:51:02,791
Please?

1455
01:51:15,958 --> 01:51:19,416
Somebody tried to invade in to my privacy,

1456
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:21,583
that didn’t kill me.

1457
01:51:23,375 --> 01:51:27,041
Somebody tried to invade in to my self respect,

1458
01:51:27,500 --> 01:51:29,041
that didn’t kill me either.

1459
01:51:30,250 --> 01:51:31,083
HE

1460
01:51:32,791 --> 01:51:36,125
He invaded my soul, churned everything!!

1461
01:51:37,458 --> 01:51:39,250
This wouldn't kill me either, I guess.

1462
01:51:40,583 --> 01:51:42,416
How I wish I walk down now

1463
01:51:42,416 --> 01:51:46,500
and I see you there standing and smiling… It would be   
 perfect!

1464
01:51:46,500 --> 01:51:47,916
Impossible, isn't it?

1465
01:51:48,958 --> 01:51:51,458
You are the baggage of my soul.

1466
01:51:52,875 --> 01:51:54,833
Carrying it gracefully, is all that I can do!

1467
01:51:55,166 --> 01:51:56,166
Till I am here...

1468
01:51:56,416 --> 01:51:57,458
Even after!

1469
01:51:58,875 --> 01:52:00,458
This life, why is it like this?

1470
01:52:00,458 --> 01:52:02,291
Is it real or an illusion?

1471
01:52:02,291 --> 01:52:03,500
I can’t comprehend.

1472
01:52:05,416 --> 01:52:07,083
I feel so FULL

1473
01:52:07,083 --> 01:52:09,500
And so EMPTY all the time.

1474
01:52:25,958 --> 01:52:33,833
"When you are at the crossroads"

1475
01:52:36,041 --> 01:52:42,291
"Unable to bear the pain of blurred destination"

1476
01:52:43,750 --> 01:52:53,208
"Layers of heart has caught fire and exploding"

1477
01:52:54,375 --> 01:52:58,208
"You are for yourself, my friend"

1478
01:52:58,500 --> 01:53:02,000
"You are for yourself"
