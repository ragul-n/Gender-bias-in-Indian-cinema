1
00:03:35,241 --> 00:03:36,868
Where are you, Kaajal?

2
00:03:37,243 --> 00:03:39,211
I am here,
getting your breakfast ready.

3
00:03:39,746 --> 00:03:41,714
Forget the breakfast, darling.
I am already late.

4
00:03:41,914 --> 00:03:43,882
No way! Have your breakfast first!

5
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:45,808
You are too much!

6
00:03:49,389 --> 00:03:51,687
Smelling good? What's the matter?

7
00:03:52,692 --> 00:03:54,660
And looking very handsome too!

8
00:03:55,628 --> 00:03:58,256
Where are you headed to?
- Think positive, darling!

9
00:03:58,531 --> 00:04:00,829
Where else can I go except to office
that too so early in the morning?

10
00:04:01,467 --> 00:04:03,662
Well, you seem to be dressed
up for a date!

11
00:04:06,306 --> 00:04:07,773
Hey...
- Okay now?

12
00:04:08,207 --> 00:04:10,767
I was just joking!
Why do you get so serious?

13
00:04:11,244 --> 00:04:12,734
It always starts as a joke...

14
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,744
to develop into a series of questions
suspecting me...

15
00:04:14,914 --> 00:04:16,882
making me late for office everyday!
I have so much work pending today.

16
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:19,648
Why? Don't you have work everyday?

17
00:04:22,455 --> 00:04:24,787
At least listen to me, Kishan!
- What should I listen?

18
00:04:25,391 --> 00:04:27,757
Why don't you schedule this
interrogation for Sundays?

19
00:04:28,227 --> 00:04:30,695
I can't really help it! Every morning,
I wake up with a resolve...

20
00:04:30,897 --> 00:04:33,525
...that I will not doubt you,
but it all goes kaput in a short while.

21
00:04:34,233 --> 00:04:35,860
Please forgive me!

22
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:39,538
Have this toast at least.

23
00:04:41,307 --> 00:04:44,868
I'll eat this toast later.
Let me hug you first.

24
00:04:46,346 --> 00:04:48,871
I love you.
- Enough! Go on, now.

25
00:04:53,353 --> 00:04:56,652
Hey! What are you doing?
- Watching TV.

26
00:04:57,523 --> 00:04:59,753
Switch it off and attend
to your chores! Go!

27
00:05:01,627 --> 00:05:04,596
Listen! What is that you are wearing?

28
00:05:05,698 --> 00:05:08,326
A sari and a blouse!
- I know that!

29
00:05:09,202 --> 00:05:12,569
But why all these openings behind?
- For air circulation!

30
00:05:12,905 --> 00:05:15,271
Well, you see, you have ACs,
coolers, everything.

31
00:05:15,575 --> 00:05:17,668
But this is the only arrangement
for me!

32
00:05:17,944 --> 00:05:21,175
Really! This won't work here.
If you want to work in this house...

33
00:05:21,581 --> 00:05:24,607
...keep your AC and cooler covered!
Understood? Go!

34
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:28,881
Look at that! He talks of important
work at the office and...

35
00:05:29,222 --> 00:05:30,587
forgot to take the file

36
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:35,227
Kaajal!

37
00:05:35,628 --> 00:05:38,188
So many times I have asked you
to refrain from...

38
00:05:38,564 --> 00:05:40,532
you made me forget the file.

39
00:05:51,978 --> 00:05:54,139
Hey, Lakshmi! Where is Kaajal?

40
00:05:55,848 --> 00:05:57,816
Madam has gone for her bath.
Won't be out before an hour.

41
00:06:00,853 --> 00:06:03,321
What's up?
You seem to be in a bad mood.

42
00:06:04,524 --> 00:06:06,822
You ask me to wear such
AC-cooler blouses!

43
00:06:07,193 --> 00:06:10,492
Madam says that it's not done!
To whom should I listen?

44
00:06:11,864 --> 00:06:15,766
Neither to me nor to her!
Just listen to your heart, Lakshmi!

45
00:06:44,263 --> 00:06:48,632
Is it a really an important file?
- No... just a namesake file!

46
00:07:06,185 --> 00:07:07,812
What happened, madam?

47
00:07:08,187 --> 00:07:10,485
What happened, madam?
Sir left a long time ago.

48
00:07:14,193 --> 00:07:16,161
Nothing! Disperse!

49
00:07:21,567 --> 00:07:23,535
Listen!
- Yes, madam.

50
00:07:23,803 --> 00:07:25,771
Here's your salary.
Don't report to work from tomorrow!

51
00:07:26,205 --> 00:07:28,173
What have I done?
- You haven't done anything yet, right?

52
00:07:28,374 --> 00:07:29,841
But you will surely end up doing
something, someday!

53
00:07:30,209 --> 00:07:32,507
I need a maid for this house and
not a heroine!

54
00:07:32,712 --> 00:07:34,839
Madam, I said that I won't wear
such blouses.

55
00:07:35,248 --> 00:07:37,216
Wear whatever and however you want to!

56
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:40,519
But not in this house! Ok?
Here you are! Get going!

57
00:07:41,554 --> 00:07:44,182
Ok, I'm leaving! However,
I will say something.

58
00:07:44,624 --> 00:07:46,854
I work in 10 houses.
And those women too have their men.

59
00:07:47,293 --> 00:07:49,193
But no one thinks the way you do!

60
00:07:49,729 --> 00:07:52,459
If you continue doing that, Sir will
get tired of you and find another

61
00:08:07,179 --> 00:08:09,579
You too? I was just explaining
this to her.

62
00:08:09,849 --> 00:08:11,749
What kind of clothes you girls wear!

63
00:08:11,951 --> 00:08:13,748
Sir, is there some problem
with this dress?

64
00:08:13,886 --> 00:08:17,549
Some problem? There are only problems!
It's...

65
00:08:18,257 --> 00:08:22,159
It's too revealing! Don't wear
such clothes to office, please!

66
00:08:22,662 --> 00:08:24,857
Your wife prompts you to say this,
isn't it, sir?

67
00:08:26,198 --> 00:08:29,326
What do you mean?
Does being henpecked make me upright?

68
00:08:29,702 --> 00:08:32,500
No, sir, it's the other way round.
- Shut up! Shut up!

69
00:08:33,272 --> 00:08:35,172
What kind of a headline is this?

70
00:08:35,641 --> 00:08:37,404
'Minister involved in sleazy sex! '

71
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:39,737
Don't you want this newspaper
to continue running?

72
00:08:40,212 --> 00:08:43,181
Publishing such a news without
proper evidence will...

73
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:45,847
No, sir, we will publish it only
after we have the evidence.

74
00:08:46,385 --> 00:08:48,353
It must be here any moment now.

75
00:08:50,323 --> 00:08:53,121
I know Shekhar won't relent without
shutting this newspaper down.

76
00:09:38,371 --> 00:09:39,861
Now this is something

77
00:10:03,696 --> 00:10:06,859
Don't do such risky works!
You are not just an employee for me.

78
00:10:07,233 --> 00:10:08,825
You are my friend; my younger brother.

79
00:10:09,235 --> 00:10:11,203
You will land up in big trouble
some day!

80
00:10:11,404 --> 00:10:15,204
Sir... I can even lay down my life to
repay the favours you have done to me.

81
00:10:16,409 --> 00:10:20,209
How can I forget the day
when I simply loitered around...

82
00:10:20,579 --> 00:10:22,547
in a deprived and dishevelled state?

83
00:10:22,915 --> 00:10:25,816
You were the one who supported
and helped me then.

84
00:10:26,252 --> 00:10:29,688
But... you never mentioned
about your family till date.

85
00:10:32,324 --> 00:10:34,952
You seem to belong to
a well-to-do family.

86
00:10:37,263 --> 00:10:39,390
What do you mean by 'seem to belong'?
I do belong to one.

87
00:10:40,032 --> 00:10:42,694
I mean, what brings you to this city
all of a sudden and...

88
00:10:43,269 --> 00:10:45,567
that too in such a state?

89
00:10:46,939 --> 00:10:52,673
Sir... my father had a cap-business.

90
00:10:54,213 --> 00:10:56,841
And his partner actually
capped him one day.

91
00:10:57,683 --> 00:11:00,846
The land, the property, the money,
he grabbed everything.

92
00:11:02,888 --> 00:11:06,688
Since nothing else was left, this cap
was his only inheritance to me.

93
00:11:10,262 --> 00:11:13,197
Anyway, sir... which one among these
photos should we publish?

94
00:11:14,233 --> 00:11:16,599
None of these!

95
00:11:17,236 --> 00:11:19,295
Sir, I literally snatched these
photos from a dog's mouth!

96
00:11:19,572 --> 00:11:22,473
Sunny! Enmity with ministers
can cost us dearly!

97
00:11:23,242 --> 00:11:25,642
Already our newspaper is in the red,
do you now want it to shut shop?

98
00:11:25,945 --> 00:11:31,008
Nothing of the sort will happen, sir.
This would rather double up our sales!

99
00:11:31,617 --> 00:11:34,882
Women are in constant lookout for
a proof of their husband's affairs...

100
00:11:35,254 --> 00:11:38,781
...to enable them to put collars
around their necks!

101
00:11:39,925 --> 00:11:41,893
We will provide them
with the proof, sir.

102
00:11:42,495 --> 00:11:45,896
And after that... every morning...
women will make do without...

103
00:11:46,265 --> 00:11:47,892
the vegetables but
not without our newspaper...

104
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:51,394
...constantly anticipating their
husband's photograph in it

105
00:11:52,605 --> 00:11:55,733
Yes, Sunny! This will help half
the population of husbands...

106
00:11:55,941 --> 00:11:58,569
...secure divorce and the rest will
mend their ways on their own.

107
00:11:58,878 --> 00:12:00,846
But, what will be the fate of
our newspaper after that?

108
00:12:01,213 --> 00:12:03,181
It will continue to sell,
even after that.

109
00:12:03,382 --> 00:12:05,179
Every husband in the world can
mend his ways...

110
00:12:05,317 --> 00:12:09,185
but not your friend Prem!
- Yes!

111
00:12:09,655 --> 00:12:12,624
We will click his pictures! He couldn't
reform in his previous birth...

112
00:12:12,892 --> 00:12:15,520
not at all in this birth and will
never in his next birth even.

113
00:12:50,262 --> 00:12:53,595
"Just love me!"

114
00:12:54,366 --> 00:12:56,163
"Am I alone?"

115
00:12:56,702 --> 00:13:02,504
"Surrounded by pretty young things!"

116
00:13:07,379 --> 00:13:11,179
"Just love me!"

117
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,775
"Am I alone?"

118
00:13:14,386 --> 00:13:20,188
"Surrounded by pretty young things!"

119
00:14:09,441 --> 00:14:17,405
"The story of life is momentary."

120
00:14:18,217 --> 00:14:25,589
"The magic of youth, once
lost is gone forever."

121
00:14:26,558 --> 00:14:30,619
"All you pretty ones!"

122
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:34,730
"Come, let me embrace and
love you all."

123
00:14:35,301 --> 00:14:38,737
"Tomorrow is so unpredictable,
sweetheart!"

124
00:14:43,509 --> 00:14:46,808
"Just love me!"

125
00:15:14,239 --> 00:15:22,169
"I am known to be an admirer of
beauty by one and all."

126
00:15:22,648 --> 00:15:30,612
"Every girl gets bowled over
by my charisma!"

127
00:15:31,256 --> 00:15:34,851
"I live for fun and frolic!!"

128
00:15:35,327 --> 00:15:39,696
"Wild, wicked and wayward!"

129
00:15:40,232 --> 00:15:43,531
"What's wrong with being one?"

130
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,539
"Just love me!"

131
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:13,598
What! What are you saying, Prem?

132
00:16:13,866 --> 00:16:16,164
You're already back and
I don't even know of it!

133
00:16:17,202 --> 00:16:21,502
Ok, but for your work in office you'd
have come home to surprise me, isn't it?

134
00:16:23,542 --> 00:16:25,772
I can understand that you are
loaded with work.

135
00:16:26,245 --> 00:16:27,473
Just a minute... what is it?

136
00:16:27,613 --> 00:16:30,173
Isn't the freedom you have given to
Prem on the higher side?

137
00:16:30,616 --> 00:16:32,777
It's not good to trust
someone so blindly!

138
00:16:33,218 --> 00:16:35,686
Sister, leave my husband alone,
at least.

139
00:16:36,221 --> 00:16:39,190
You are so naive, Pooja!
You don't know how these men are...

140
00:16:39,558 --> 00:16:43,585
I know my Prem very well. Great virtues
earned in my previous birth.

141
00:16:44,296 --> 00:16:46,196
...have got me a husband like him.

142
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:51,859
Look, come home early today. Bye.
- Bye, sweetheart!

143
00:16:52,604 --> 00:16:55,573
Why did you call your wife if you
don't even intend to go home?

144
00:16:55,841 --> 00:16:57,809
One should always be sure
about his wife.

145
00:16:58,177 --> 00:17:01,578
What if she spots me being
so close to you?

146
00:17:09,188 --> 00:17:11,383
Hi, brother! What a timely entry!

147
00:17:11,623 --> 00:17:14,148
Take some more snaps.

148
00:17:16,462 --> 00:17:20,558
Say how about this? C'mon,
go ahead. Go ahead... click it.

149
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:24,169
Didn't you like the pose?
Here is another one!

150
00:17:25,304 --> 00:17:27,704
Click, man! Don't waste time.

151
00:17:29,808 --> 00:17:31,435
Very good! This one too!

152
00:17:34,246 --> 00:17:36,510
When will I get the photographs?
- In the evening.

153
00:17:37,282 --> 00:17:38,977
But not you, your wife will get them.

154
00:17:39,785 --> 00:17:42,720
Why? Why my wife?
- Well... he wants it that way.

155
00:17:43,322 --> 00:17:44,880
Hey! You are my friend!
The photos are mine!

156
00:17:45,224 --> 00:17:46,714
And you will give them to my wife!
What kind of a friend are you?

157
00:17:46,925 --> 00:17:51,191
A true friend! And I can do anything
to bring him on the right path.

158
00:18:04,543 --> 00:18:10,504
Kishan... I can't really understand.
Am I treading the wrong path?

159
00:18:11,183 --> 00:18:15,142
Aren't you?
You have such a good and trusting wife.

160
00:18:15,587 --> 00:18:17,817
And here you are with another girl!
Isn't this wrong?

161
00:18:18,257 --> 00:18:20,953
What's wrong with it!
Didn't you have a 'Maruti 800' before?

162
00:18:22,694 --> 00:18:25,162
So what?
- You bought a 'Zen' after that.

163
00:18:25,764 --> 00:18:27,288
Then, an 'Opel' and a 'Lancer'.

164
00:18:27,533 --> 00:18:29,398
And you own a 'Mercedes Benz'
today, pal!

165
00:18:29,635 --> 00:18:31,262
I do. But what do you want to say?

166
00:18:31,537 --> 00:18:34,165
All that I want to ask is the reason
why you changed so many cars?

167
00:18:34,506 --> 00:18:38,272
Well, driving the same car
can be so boring.

168
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:41,170
And one needs to change an old car,
isn't it?

169
00:18:41,547 --> 00:18:43,447
Right! And the wife?

170
00:18:47,219 --> 00:18:49,687
You changed 7 cars in the last 7 years!
But you still have the same wife!

171
00:18:50,222 --> 00:18:54,454
Are you crazy? Does one change his wife
like he changes his car?

172
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:59,119
Hey, you're right! We are upright guys
and that's why we don't change wives.

173
00:18:59,598 --> 00:19:03,398
But is it some sin to board
another car for a while?

174
00:19:03,769 --> 00:19:09,469
Pooja will answer this question for
you when she gets these pictures!

175
00:19:13,412 --> 00:19:16,813
Officer! Please come here.

176
00:19:17,216 --> 00:19:19,810
Please inform them about the gravity
of the crime of clicking pictures...

177
00:19:20,185 --> 00:19:22,312
...in such a high-security area.
- What are you doing?

178
00:19:22,588 --> 00:19:24,818
Sir, we were just clicking
our friend's pictures.

179
00:19:25,257 --> 00:19:27,157
Just for fun, sir!
- Are they your friends?

180
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:30,157
They are. But I cannot vouch
for any of them.

181
00:19:30,529 --> 00:19:33,589
I don't want to get into any trouble
if a plane gets hijacked.

182
00:19:34,366 --> 00:19:38,166
Come with me.
- No, officer, just have a look.

183
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:41,828
There is no roll in it.
We were just joking.

184
00:19:42,274 --> 00:19:44,742
There is no roll? You were joking!
- Yes, we were joking.

185
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:48,179
It is fine then. In that case,
I can vouch for them. Thank you.

186
00:19:49,381 --> 00:19:51,178
I knew it, brother that...

187
00:19:51,383 --> 00:19:53,681
you can never click such
objectionable pictures of mine.

188
00:19:55,287 --> 00:19:57,847
One day, I will not only do it, Prem,
I will also publish them...

189
00:19:58,223 --> 00:20:01,249
...on the front-page of my newspaper!
Just like P. K. Gupta!

190
00:20:05,597 --> 00:20:07,189
What is this?

191
00:20:09,334 --> 00:20:12,303
What is this?
- It's a photograph.

192
00:20:13,272 --> 00:20:15,206
Whose is it?
- Mine.

193
00:20:15,607 --> 00:20:18,201
It's yours! And who is with you?

194
00:20:18,577 --> 00:20:21,546
She is a girl.
- A girl! What is she to you?

195
00:20:22,247 --> 00:20:23,805
No one.
- No one?

196
00:20:24,249 --> 00:20:26,217
Then what are you doing with her?

197
00:20:29,254 --> 00:20:31,484
What am I doing? Just dancing!
Only in the picture not in reality!

198
00:20:31,723 --> 00:20:34,886
I am your wife and am not
'the public' to be fooled so easily!

199
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:37,785
Honestly, this is a conspiracy of
the opposition to defame me.

200
00:20:38,263 --> 00:20:41,232
Listen carefully! I will kill you
and myself become a widow...

201
00:20:41,533 --> 00:20:44,229
if ever I see you dancing in a
photograph even.

202
00:20:51,943 --> 00:20:55,606
That journalist really messed up
P. K. Gupta's life.

203
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:59,712
This suicide case is going to kill me.

204
00:20:59,918 --> 00:21:01,783
I haven't written a single line
in the past half an hour...

205
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,888
and this news needs to go in
tomorrow's newspaper.

206
00:21:09,227 --> 00:21:11,787
Did he throw it for you?

207
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:14,198
I wish it is for me.

208
00:21:14,599 --> 00:21:16,760
C'mon, read it fast.
Let's see what's written.

209
00:21:17,703 --> 00:21:19,864
I can't live without you.

210
00:21:20,739 --> 00:21:23,537
Wherever you are,
I want to be there with you.

211
00:21:24,676 --> 00:21:27,577
I am leaving this world for you.

212
00:21:29,681 --> 00:21:31,876
Everything will be done.
Have this tea first.

213
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:33,877
He's contemplating suicide.

214
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:36,219
He's so cute.

215
00:21:40,258 --> 00:21:42,658
Losing in love makes a person
so lifeless!

216
00:21:43,795 --> 00:21:46,229
Even the tea tastes bitter to him.

217
00:21:47,332 --> 00:21:49,630
Add some sugar, at least.
- Yeah, sure.

218
00:21:50,001 --> 00:21:53,835
Sanjana, such a handsome guy and
he wants to commit suicide?

219
00:21:54,306 --> 00:21:56,706
And that too for his dead girl-friend.

220
00:21:57,209 --> 00:21:59,177
We should save him.

221
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:05,511
Hey, where has he disappeared?

222
00:22:06,284 --> 00:22:07,546
C'mon, girls.

223
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:11,781
Hey mister, where's your friend?
- At the suicide point.

224
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:14,192
Suicide point and you didn't even
bother to stop him?

225
00:22:14,393 --> 00:22:16,861
Well he's my friend and he's doing
a good job. Why should I stop him?

226
00:22:17,229 --> 00:22:18,890
You are his friend?

227
00:22:19,598 --> 00:22:22,624
You should be ashamed of yourself...
stupid. C'mon girls, follow me.

228
00:22:29,674 --> 00:22:31,642
Wow! What a place!

229
00:22:33,245 --> 00:22:35,543
How can people commit
suicide from here?

230
00:22:44,256 --> 00:22:47,783
'Champa, because I couldn't
embrace you... '

231
00:22:48,593 --> 00:22:51,619
'I am embracing death! Your Champak! '

232
00:22:52,264 --> 00:22:53,162
How stupid!

233
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:57,165
What must he have said before dying?

234
00:23:01,206 --> 00:23:02,901
He must have definitely taken his
girl-friend's name.

235
00:23:03,275 --> 00:23:04,833
Champa...!!!

236
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:13,515
I am coming!!!

237
00:23:17,556 --> 00:23:21,185
It's his bike.
- Sanjana, he's there.

238
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,518
Champa...!!!

239
00:23:26,898 --> 00:23:29,526
Hey, stop.
- Wait...

240
00:23:30,235 --> 00:23:32,362
Hey stop... wait, what...

241
00:23:32,737 --> 00:23:35,205
No, wait... stop what are you doing?

242
00:23:35,574 --> 00:23:37,872
What are you trying to do?

243
00:23:38,743 --> 00:23:41,610
Hello, scoot from here.
- Scoot, but why?

244
00:23:41,947 --> 00:23:43,812
Who are you?
- That doesn't matter.

245
00:23:44,015 --> 00:23:46,483
I won't let you do what you have
come here for.

246
00:23:46,685 --> 00:23:49,552
Why won't you let me?
Do you own this Suicide Point?

247
00:23:49,855 --> 00:23:52,551
This is a public property and
I'll do as I wish.

248
00:23:52,791 --> 00:23:55,157
So you won't relent?
- No!

249
00:23:55,427 --> 00:23:57,395
C'mon, get hold of him.

250
00:24:06,538 --> 00:24:09,507
Help... help...
Pull me up...

251
00:24:09,841 --> 00:24:12,173
How will we pull him up,
we are not equipped.

252
00:24:12,611 --> 00:24:14,579
Hey, what are you doing?

253
00:24:15,213 --> 00:24:17,181
I can't let a cute guy die like this.

254
00:24:17,482 --> 00:24:19,450
That's why I am taking off my skirt...
you also take off you pants.

255
00:24:19,651 --> 00:24:22,711
You take off yours too. We'll turn it
into a makeshift rope and pull him up.

256
00:24:23,722 --> 00:24:26,350
My hands are slipping.
Pull me out of here.

257
00:24:26,992 --> 00:24:28,960
Hey, he's slipping. C'mon, be quick.

258
00:24:31,897 --> 00:24:35,196
Seems, they've gone from here.
Is someone else there?

259
00:24:38,436 --> 00:24:41,530
I am not here.
Pull me up.

260
00:24:44,342 --> 00:24:47,368
Hold it and come up.

261
00:24:47,913 --> 00:24:49,505
Pull him up...

262
00:25:05,196 --> 00:25:08,688
'Get out of here, Sunny! They've
got another weapon to kill you.'

263
00:25:27,686 --> 00:25:30,177
That's a nice style of expressing
gratitude!

264
00:25:33,525 --> 00:25:35,493
Hey, he's going.

265
00:25:36,227 --> 00:25:38,787
Fast, note down his bike number.
- But why?

266
00:25:38,997 --> 00:25:40,862
We'll inform his family that...

267
00:25:41,232 --> 00:25:44,201
he wants to commit suicide.
Then it's upto him and his family.

268
00:25:44,603 --> 00:25:46,867
01-222. BA-01-222.

269
00:25:49,274 --> 00:25:52,209
I'll tell you about your past
and your future...

270
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:54,137
I'll tell you everything.

271
00:25:54,512 --> 00:25:56,810
I'll make predictions about your
destiny, you handsome couple.

272
00:25:57,449 --> 00:25:59,679
Let's ask him,
when will we have our kid?

273
00:26:00,185 --> 00:26:03,677
Kaajal, the world has reached the moon
and you want to ask this parrot?

274
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:06,817
Okay, we'll ask him. Come...

275
00:26:07,225 --> 00:26:09,716
Come and get your predictions,
handsome couple.

276
00:26:10,261 --> 00:26:13,719
Tell me first, which parrot is going
to make the predictions?

277
00:26:14,866 --> 00:26:17,733
The parrot will point the card and
I'll make the predictions.

278
00:26:18,303 --> 00:26:20,828
Raja, tell me the number of this
gentleman.

279
00:26:21,339 --> 00:26:25,605
Number two.
- Number two! Aha!

280
00:26:26,211 --> 00:26:29,180
Brother, you are so fortunate.
You are twice blessed.

281
00:26:29,481 --> 00:26:31,176
You've two houses?
- Yes!

282
00:26:31,416 --> 00:26:33,179
You've two offices?
- Yes!

283
00:26:33,418 --> 00:26:35,511
You've got two cars?
- Of course!

284
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:38,188
And two wives?
- 100%

285
00:26:38,456 --> 00:26:39,616
What?

286
00:26:40,892 --> 00:26:42,757
Hey, what crap are you talking?

287
00:26:43,228 --> 00:26:46,197
It's not crap. I am just reading
what's written here.

288
00:26:47,532 --> 00:26:51,263
Now, I know why
you were making excuses?

289
00:26:52,237 --> 00:26:54,137
Please tell us some more.

290
00:26:56,241 --> 00:26:58,641
He's got a child from
his second marriage.

291
00:26:59,177 --> 00:27:00,701
Child?
- Hey!

292
00:27:02,414 --> 00:27:05,474
Kaajal, don't cry.
I don't have any child.

293
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:07,681
Kaajal, he's...
- Daddy...

294
00:27:12,524 --> 00:27:15,152
Daddy...
- He's not my kid, Kaajal!

295
00:27:17,262 --> 00:27:19,355
I swear on you,
I don't even know him, Kaajal.

296
00:27:19,597 --> 00:27:21,656
Then why is he coming
running towards you?

297
00:27:22,734 --> 00:27:25,635
Daddy... daddy, I want a balloon.

298
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:27,838
You want a balloon, come we'll
buy it for you.

299
00:27:28,239 --> 00:27:32,573
Mister, keep you child in control,
he almost got me killed.

300
00:27:33,278 --> 00:27:34,677
Spoilt my entire mood!

301
00:27:34,879 --> 00:27:36,710
Did you see that, Kaajal...
he's not my...

302
00:27:36,915 --> 00:27:40,180
The kid may not be yours
but you do have a second wife.

303
00:27:42,487 --> 00:27:44,182
Kaajal, listen to me...
- I know you very well.

304
00:27:44,389 --> 00:27:45,913
Listen to me, Kaajal! He's a fraud.

305
00:27:46,891 --> 00:27:49,689
Kaajal, why are you crying?
- What to say?

306
00:27:50,295 --> 00:27:52,855
Today being a Sunday I thought to
take Kaajal out...

307
00:27:53,331 --> 00:27:55,128
...but that astrologer...

308
00:27:55,567 --> 00:27:58,127
Hey, why don't we ask him, let us get
your predictions from him?

309
00:27:58,837 --> 00:28:01,465
Then we will come to know whether
he's genuine or a fraud.

310
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:05,134
Of course, why not?
Come, let's try our luck.

311
00:28:14,919 --> 00:28:16,819
Just wait and see! The reality
will be out any moment.

312
00:28:17,188 --> 00:28:20,487
Raja, tell me this generous
gentleman's card number.

313
00:28:20,959 --> 00:28:24,156
Number One.
- Number one? Aha!

314
00:28:27,198 --> 00:28:31,157
His heart complies with his
innocent face!

315
00:28:33,304 --> 00:28:36,239
What makes you take birth in this
dark age?

316
00:28:37,976 --> 00:28:40,843
You are really fortunate, sister,
that you've got...

317
00:28:41,212 --> 00:28:44,181
...a saint for a husband in these
wretched times.

318
00:28:45,683 --> 00:28:47,651
And my prediction is that this
man has never...

319
00:28:47,886 --> 00:28:50,411
...laid his eyes on another woman
and will never do it.

320
00:28:50,622 --> 00:28:52,783
He's taken you as his wife for all
your future births.

321
00:28:53,158 --> 00:28:54,853
You are really blessed!

322
00:28:56,361 --> 00:28:58,454
Did you hear that? Did you?

323
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:00,197
Kaajal...

324
00:29:00,565 --> 00:29:01,657
Kaajal... Pooja...

325
00:29:02,167 --> 00:29:04,465
Don't cry, Kaajal.

326
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:07,638
Whatever, you had to speak about
me you did it for him...

327
00:29:07,906 --> 00:29:08,873
Your parrot, I'll...

328
00:29:09,207 --> 00:29:12,142
Not the parrot but the money speaks,
my friend...

329
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:13,636
Money...!?

330
00:29:14,179 --> 00:29:15,476
Come here...

331
00:29:15,847 --> 00:29:17,712
I have been trying hard to make
you understand but in vain.

332
00:29:17,916 --> 00:29:19,850
What is the most important thing
that God has given us?

333
00:29:20,185 --> 00:29:22,153
Brains. And why?
To use it to our advantage... to lie...

334
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,147
To have a few girlfriends on the sly.

335
00:29:24,355 --> 00:29:27,813
Few? I don't have even one and yet
she has tried to commit suicide twice.

336
00:29:28,326 --> 00:29:31,159
If I did have one then...
- Nothing will happen.

337
00:29:31,529 --> 00:29:33,394
I'll explain you the logic.

338
00:29:33,631 --> 00:29:35,599
A man is a very sensitive creature...

339
00:29:35,967 --> 00:29:38,731
...and that's why whenever
he has an extra-marital affair...

340
00:29:39,204 --> 00:29:41,729
...he feels guilty and showers
his wife with love...

341
00:29:42,207 --> 00:29:45,699
...making the wife think that
her husband loves her a lot.

342
00:29:46,878 --> 00:29:51,781
And when he doesn't have an affair,
he comes home, exhausted.

343
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:55,175
Quietly he slips into his pyjamas,
eats his dinner,

344
00:29:55,553 --> 00:29:58,681
watches television, fights
and goes off to sleep.

345
00:29:59,257 --> 00:30:01,521
And that's when a wife
starts suspecting that...

346
00:30:02,227 --> 00:30:04,559
her husband is having an affair.

347
00:30:07,232 --> 00:30:08,859
Why are you thinking so much?

348
00:30:09,234 --> 00:30:13,762
Do as I say and you will find Kaajal
happy just as Pooja is.

349
00:30:14,239 --> 00:30:15,866
And that's my guarantee!

350
00:30:19,244 --> 00:30:22,213
I have just given you the idea and see
the result are evident.

351
00:30:22,914 --> 00:30:25,212
That's nice.
- Isn't it? Then it's fun from now on.

352
00:30:26,651 --> 00:30:28,778
What is going on, Kaajal!
Wipe your tears.

353
00:30:29,254 --> 00:30:30,881
I can't see you like this.

354
00:30:31,256 --> 00:30:33,224
Okay, fine...
everything will be alright.

355
00:30:33,524 --> 00:30:36,755
Tonight, I am taking him for dinner
with me. So he'll be late.

356
00:30:37,295 --> 00:30:39,229
Why should I worry
when you are around?

357
00:30:39,664 --> 00:30:41,757
But make him understand.
Teach him something.

358
00:30:42,267 --> 00:30:45,236
Make him just like you, Prem!
- Did you hear that?

359
00:30:46,037 --> 00:30:47,834
Be ready tonight.
- Where are you taking me?

360
00:30:48,339 --> 00:30:50,569
Just come along.

361
00:31:05,523 --> 00:31:08,185
"Hi gorgeous!"

362
00:31:22,273 --> 00:31:24,707
"A few lost their fortunes!"

363
00:31:27,712 --> 00:31:29,680
"A few their beats!"

364
00:31:33,251 --> 00:31:35,219
"Yet others lost their lives!"

365
00:31:38,356 --> 00:31:40,551
"While the rest lost
their whole worlds!"

366
00:31:44,262 --> 00:31:47,231
"A few lost their fortunes and beats!"

367
00:31:47,598 --> 00:31:51,227
"Yet other lost their lives and
their worlds!

368
00:31:51,502 --> 00:31:54,699
"The whole of country was robbed!"

369
00:31:55,273 --> 00:32:02,179
"The lane of love has a - No Entry!"

370
00:32:17,395 --> 00:32:19,625
"They all get my charms..."

371
00:32:21,232 --> 00:32:23,427
"those who come across me"

372
00:32:24,669 --> 00:32:26,796
"They go crazy..."

373
00:32:28,239 --> 00:32:30,298
"dreaming about me"

374
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:41,776
"My eyes are intoxicating,
my nuances, sensuous"

375
00:32:42,253 --> 00:32:44,744
"Anyone who sees me,
falls for me"

376
00:32:46,257 --> 00:32:49,385
"The lane of love has a - No Entry!"

377
00:33:14,986 --> 00:33:16,954
"My sweetheart, O' my sweetie pie!"

378
00:33:20,224 --> 00:33:22,522
"Just listen to me, buttercups!"

379
00:33:29,634 --> 00:33:32,797
"Let's enjoy this spring of love!"

380
00:33:33,638 --> 00:33:36,368
"Let's trap the whole country!"

381
00:33:37,742 --> 00:33:44,204
"The lane of love should now have a
- Yes Entry!"

382
00:33:51,956 --> 00:33:57,519
"Getting love-struck is said
to be essential, my love!"

383
00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:04,827
"All stories are incomplete
without love, sweetheart!"

384
00:34:13,211 --> 00:34:16,305
"Meeting on the sly and exchanging
sweet-nothings..."

385
00:34:16,647 --> 00:34:19,514
"...is something everyone should
try at least once!"

386
00:34:24,555 --> 00:34:31,188
"The lane of love should now have a
- Yes Entry!"

387
00:34:49,347 --> 00:34:50,871
How come you are boozing tonight?

388
00:34:51,249 --> 00:34:55,151
My wife is at his house and so I have
a chance to get knocked out, today.

389
00:34:56,187 --> 00:34:58,849
Kishan! This is Bobby.

390
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:10,827
This is a club and not a temple.
Here, you meet like this.

391
00:35:11,802 --> 00:35:13,770
Kishan! Don't let her go.

392
00:35:15,206 --> 00:35:17,834
Prem, ask her to let go of me.
- No...

393
00:35:21,212 --> 00:35:22,702
Didn't you like it?

394
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:25,505
I like the perfume...
- What? Bobby...

395
00:35:27,885 --> 00:35:29,443
You liked only the perfume?

396
00:35:29,654 --> 00:35:32,179
Prem, Kaajal must be waiting for me.
Allow me to go now.

397
00:35:32,623 --> 00:35:34,591
Nice meeting you. Bye!

398
00:35:37,228 --> 00:35:40,197
Don't look at him, he's a married man.

399
00:35:40,565 --> 00:35:43,363
He loves his wife very much!
- Is that so?

400
00:35:46,237 --> 00:35:50,196
I'll pay you two hundred thousand
if you can to corrupt him.

401
00:35:51,642 --> 00:35:55,134
Two hundred thousand? Bet?
- Yes!

402
00:35:55,546 --> 00:36:00,574
Consider yourself having lost it!

403
00:36:01,185 --> 00:36:02,812
Bobby, come here.
- Coming.

404
00:36:03,254 --> 00:36:04,482
Hey wait...

405
00:36:09,927 --> 00:36:11,554
Okay, bye...

406
00:36:12,863 --> 00:36:14,160
Prem...

407
00:36:14,632 --> 00:36:18,830
Prem, what kind of a trap are
you setting that poor guy in?

408
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:24,164
He's not a poor guy. He clicks
my objectionable photographs!

409
00:36:25,209 --> 00:36:31,170
Just let me get something against him
and I won't spare him.

410
00:36:40,825 --> 00:36:43,623
You know, what the ladies were saying?
- What?

411
00:36:44,228 --> 00:36:47,197
They were saying, that we have been
celebrating 'Janmashtmi'

412
00:36:47,398 --> 00:36:52,700
...for so many years now. Very soon we
will be blessed with a child like him.

413
00:36:55,239 --> 00:36:58,470
Be positive! Surely and very
soon we will have one!

414
00:37:08,719 --> 00:37:10,550
What fragrance is this?

415
00:37:12,189 --> 00:37:16,489
Well... it's a perfume...
- Even I know that?

416
00:37:19,196 --> 00:37:21,494
But this is some new one...
not the regular one.

417
00:37:22,867 --> 00:37:26,701
Very true... One of Prem's
friends had put it on me.

418
00:37:27,204 --> 00:37:32,437
He has a perfume store.
I resisted a lot but he had his way.

419
00:37:35,212 --> 00:37:37,180
So, what's the problem?
- Problem?

420
00:37:37,481 --> 00:37:42,509
It's a nice one. You should use it.
- Is that so?

421
00:37:42,887 --> 00:37:44,855
I'll bring some sweets for you.

422
00:37:51,562 --> 00:37:54,622
What is this, Lord? Everyday,
my truths get me a solid bashing.

423
00:37:55,766 --> 00:37:58,599
And my first lie in life earns
me sweets!?

424
00:38:00,571 --> 00:38:03,631
It's not difficult to fool the wives.

425
00:38:05,176 --> 00:38:08,145
Should I step in the 'No Entry' zone,
just like Prem?

426
00:38:09,613 --> 00:38:14,141
No, no... it's not good
to deceive one's wife.

427
00:38:15,353 --> 00:38:17,821
But I surely liked what happened today.

428
00:38:20,291 --> 00:38:22,759
What did you like?
- Everything?

429
00:38:24,195 --> 00:38:25,753
Isn't Pooja at home?

430
00:38:25,963 --> 00:38:27,828
She's gone home...
- What?

431
00:38:28,199 --> 00:38:29,723
She asked me to go to her
place tomorrow...

432
00:38:29,867 --> 00:38:31,698
from where we will go to visit the
temple.

433
00:38:32,203 --> 00:38:35,832
Prem won't be spared today. He will
reach home drunk to find Pooja there!

434
00:38:36,674 --> 00:38:38,642
Let me relish the sweets on this!

435
00:39:03,434 --> 00:39:05,402
You had a drink?

436
00:39:07,605 --> 00:39:12,804
Don't ask my whether I had it.
Ask me why I had it.

437
00:39:13,377 --> 00:39:14,344
Why?

438
00:39:14,545 --> 00:39:20,677
That's because one of our employees
tried molesting a female staff member.

439
00:39:21,252 --> 00:39:26,656
He misbehaved with her.

440
00:39:27,191 --> 00:39:31,685
When I asked him the reason of his
behaviour...

441
00:39:32,263 --> 00:39:38,566
he said that she appeared to be his
wife to him in his inebriated state.

442
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:41,638
So, I gave him a tight slap.

443
00:39:42,606 --> 00:39:47,168
Sobbing, he started saying that since
I am a gentleman...

444
00:39:47,545 --> 00:39:52,175
who has never had a drink,
I would never come to know...

445
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:56,714
...that every woman appears to
be one's wife, when one is drunk.

446
00:39:57,221 --> 00:39:59,712
So, I immediately bought one
bottle and drank it all.

447
00:40:00,624 --> 00:40:02,592
You drank one whole bottle?

448
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:07,194
Just because he had a full bottle,
I did the same.

449
00:40:09,233 --> 00:40:10,200
Then?

450
00:40:10,401 --> 00:40:15,634
Then I asked the staff girls
to stand in a line.

451
00:40:16,373 --> 00:40:19,536
And then I recognised them
by their respective names.

452
00:40:20,344 --> 00:40:22,312
None of them appeared me to be
my wife among them.

453
00:40:22,613 --> 00:40:28,210
So, I called him and said that when
I couldn't see my wife in them...

454
00:40:28,419 --> 00:40:29,886
how could he?

455
00:40:30,254 --> 00:40:31,881
He kept quiet and others were stunned.

456
00:40:32,323 --> 00:40:35,554
I thrashed him,
caught him by his hair...

457
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:40,797
and said, 'You are maligning the
spirit of liquor.'

458
00:40:41,465 --> 00:40:45,231
'Have you ever treated
your mother or...

459
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:48,568
sister as you wife in
an inebriated state?

460
00:40:50,608 --> 00:40:52,735
I pushed him and
sacked him then and there.

461
00:40:56,213 --> 00:40:58,181
Did I do something wrong?

462
00:40:58,916 --> 00:41:01,680
You've never wronged anyone.

463
00:41:02,486 --> 00:41:06,183
I know... I know,
your husband is very strong.

464
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:19,196
O Lord! Make Pooja my wife
in all my births!

465
00:41:26,243 --> 00:41:28,336
Hey! Prem, you seem to be very
happy today.

466
00:41:28,579 --> 00:41:31,946
Whenever my scoundrel friends land
in a soup, it gives me great joy.

467
00:41:32,583 --> 00:41:34,915
Which friend of yours has landed
in a soup, pal?

468
00:41:35,286 --> 00:41:37,618
Not already landed but
Kishan is about to!

469
00:41:37,922 --> 00:41:39,890
I have sent Bobby after him.

470
00:41:40,257 --> 00:41:42,623
But, he's an upright guy.

471
00:41:42,927 --> 00:41:44,895
No matter how upright
a person may be...

472
00:41:45,262 --> 00:41:49,221
seeing a bombshell like Bobby
is sure to make him falter.

473
00:41:50,267 --> 00:41:51,234
Very true!

474
00:41:51,435 --> 00:41:54,404
Bobby has taken him out shopping.
- You are a first rate scoundrel.

475
00:41:55,639 --> 00:41:59,905
What are you scared for? I'm not
going to fleece you like your wife.

476
00:42:03,213 --> 00:42:08,173
I'm tired.
- Oh come on! Let's check out there.

477
00:42:12,022 --> 00:42:13,580
May I buy a necklace?

478
00:42:19,897 --> 00:42:21,592
How's this?
- Nice.

479
00:42:21,966 --> 00:42:23,524
Put it on me.

480
00:42:39,984 --> 00:42:43,818
What's wrong, sis?
- I think I saw Kishan with some girl.

481
00:42:44,254 --> 00:42:46,779
You go a bit overboard with this
habit of suspecting him.

482
00:42:47,257 --> 00:42:49,225
You always feel that he is with
some or the other girl.

483
00:42:49,393 --> 00:42:51,657
It's not an imagination.
I actually saw him.

484
00:43:20,491 --> 00:43:21,890
Hello! Sunrise Publications!

485
00:43:22,493 --> 00:43:23,755
Sunny, it's me.

486
00:43:24,328 --> 00:43:26,660
Me? Who?
- It's me! Kishan!

487
00:43:27,564 --> 00:43:28,861
Sir, your voice sounds so different.

488
00:43:29,233 --> 00:43:32,725
Sunny, transfer my cabin phone
to my mobile.

489
00:43:33,704 --> 00:43:36,195
Why do you worry, sir?
I'm here to take messages for you.

490
00:43:37,041 --> 00:43:39,441
And I will finish you off! Transfer
the line immediately or else...

491
00:43:39,643 --> 00:43:42,203
I will get you transferred.
- Okay, sir.

492
00:43:48,485 --> 00:43:49,918
What are you doing?
- I'm calling up at his office.

493
00:43:50,254 --> 00:43:51,221
Office?

494
00:43:56,593 --> 00:43:57,821
Where are you, Kishan?

495
00:43:58,195 --> 00:44:00,755
In Paris. About to jump down
from the Eiffel Tower.

496
00:44:01,198 --> 00:44:03,166
Why do you say so?
- What else should I do?

497
00:44:03,467 --> 00:44:05,162
Where have you called up?
At the office, isn't it?

498
00:44:05,369 --> 00:44:06,768
Where else would I be other
than the office?

499
00:44:06,970 --> 00:44:08,767
Hey! Sunny, just get my files please.

500
00:44:09,206 --> 00:44:11,572
Tell me what is it? I've a lot of work.
- Nothing.

501
00:44:11,875 --> 00:44:14,435
I just called up as I was missing you.
You are unnecessarily getting upset.

502
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:18,348
Where is he?
- In office.

503
00:44:26,557 --> 00:44:28,525
What happened?
Why are you so scared?

504
00:44:28,759 --> 00:44:31,193
Where the heck have you brought me?
My wife is here.

505
00:44:31,562 --> 00:44:34,690
I was wondering what made you vanish.
- Rather, I am going to vanish now.

506
00:44:35,232 --> 00:44:37,200
If she spots me with you,
this shopping centre...

507
00:44:37,401 --> 00:44:39,198
is going to vanish just like the WTC.

508
00:44:39,403 --> 00:44:42,201
Sorry. Bye.
- Hey!

509
00:44:45,676 --> 00:44:47,871
God knows when I'll get a chance
to earn 200,000!

510
00:44:56,854 --> 00:44:58,151
What happened?

511
00:44:59,723 --> 00:45:02,715
It's his car.
- Yes, it's Kishan's car.

512
00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:07,560
But why is it here?
- That means he lied to me.

513
00:45:11,802 --> 00:45:13,770
I'm doomed. O Bhagwan (God), save me!

514
00:45:14,271 --> 00:45:16,171
Did you call me? What's it?

515
00:45:16,573 --> 00:45:18,165
You?
- Yes. My name is Bhagwan.

516
00:45:18,308 --> 00:45:20,276
You called me, didn't you?
What is it?

517
00:45:20,477 --> 00:45:23,173
No, not you.
I was remembering the Almighty!

518
00:45:23,447 --> 00:45:24,846
Ok. It's fine then.

519
00:45:31,288 --> 00:45:34,189
Yes, Kaajal.
- Are you still in the office, Kishan?

520
00:45:35,325 --> 00:45:38,692
Come here and see for yourself.
- No. I just need your car.

521
00:45:39,963 --> 00:45:42,523
It's parked outside the City Centre.
- Why?

522
00:45:42,766 --> 00:45:44,529
I went there for shopping, love.

523
00:45:44,902 --> 00:45:47,530
The car broke down. And the
driver is on his way there.

524
00:45:47,905 --> 00:45:52,467
Tell me where to send him.
- I too had come to the City Centre.

525
00:45:52,843 --> 00:45:54,811
Spotted your car,
so just enquired about it.

526
00:45:55,179 --> 00:45:57,477
You suspect me so much.
What would Pooja think?

527
00:45:58,248 --> 00:46:00,148
No, I am not suspecting...

528
00:46:01,251 --> 00:46:03,742
How do you know Pooja is with me?
- You are so naive.

529
00:46:04,221 --> 00:46:06,621
Have you ever been out for shopping
alone? I just made a guess.

530
00:46:07,257 --> 00:46:09,748
I will hang up now.
- Kiss me first.

531
00:46:10,861 --> 00:46:13,159
I'm disconnecting the line. Bye.
- Bye.

532
00:46:14,231 --> 00:46:15,823
O' God!

533
00:46:21,805 --> 00:46:23,773
My landlady threw my belongings
out of the house.

534
00:46:24,274 --> 00:46:25,832
She threw me out of the house.

535
00:46:26,210 --> 00:46:28,178
That crazy female spread
the word that...

536
00:46:28,345 --> 00:46:31,178
I am committing suicide for
some girl named Champa.

537
00:46:32,216 --> 00:46:33,774
Who is this Champa?

538
00:46:37,221 --> 00:46:38,848
Laugh as much as you want.

539
00:46:39,223 --> 00:46:41,191
But tell me where I will stay now.

540
00:46:42,226 --> 00:46:44,194
She has rendered me homeless.

541
00:46:44,561 --> 00:46:46,529
Don't worry. Stay there.

542
00:46:47,231 --> 00:46:51,190
There? Outside?
- Not outside. Come here.

543
00:46:53,170 --> 00:46:56,139
In my guesthouse.
It's locked since many years.

544
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:59,138
Here are the keys.

545
00:47:03,580 --> 00:47:06,811
Is this house mine?
- Just to live in it.

546
00:47:16,627 --> 00:47:18,492
Your favours are piling up on me.

547
00:47:18,862 --> 00:47:20,762
How can I ever repay them?

548
00:47:21,198 --> 00:47:23,166
Don't worry about that, Sunny.

549
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:25,468
I will take it back with interest,
as and when needed.

550
00:47:25,802 --> 00:47:28,270
I am ready to lay my life for you,
brother! Kill me if I object.

551
00:47:28,639 --> 00:47:32,769
Do that later. Get that house cleaned
first. It is infested with mice.

552
00:47:33,543 --> 00:47:36,842
I'll take care of the mice, sister.
But I dread that pest of a girl.

553
00:47:38,315 --> 00:47:40,283
See, I am already hiccupping.

554
00:47:41,718 --> 00:47:44,186
She is definitely plotting
something for me.

555
00:47:46,890 --> 00:47:49,415
Sanjana, look there. Champa's lover.

556
00:47:54,598 --> 00:47:56,463
I think he has changed his mind.

557
00:47:56,700 --> 00:48:00,136
No, in order to deceive others,
such people act happy.

558
00:48:00,604 --> 00:48:04,131
But they continue to suffer from
within. C'mon girls, let's go.

559
00:48:07,277 --> 00:48:09,643
Yes please?
- Do you have rat-poison?

560
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:12,375
Here's your rat-poison.
- Thank you!

561
00:48:12,582 --> 00:48:14,482
Give me Dettol as well.
- Dettol Soap too?!

562
00:48:15,185 --> 00:48:17,415
Dettol? Even in soap he's
searching for death.

563
00:48:17,621 --> 00:48:19,145
Can't he buy a 'Lifebuoy'?

564
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,489
But why is he buying a rope?

565
00:48:25,696 --> 00:48:29,462
To kill himself with the rope
if the rat-poison deceives him.

566
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:31,663
Thank you. Do keep coming.

567
00:48:57,294 --> 00:48:58,727
Peep in from there.

568
00:48:59,162 --> 00:49:01,130
Try to see what he's doing here?

569
00:49:07,504 --> 00:49:09,529
Hey, he's climbing on the chair.

570
00:49:12,175 --> 00:49:14,666
He's hanging the rope. O' my God!
- What happened?

571
00:49:15,178 --> 00:49:18,147
He's preparing to kill himself.
- Preparing to kill himself?

572
00:49:19,182 --> 00:49:21,742
Hey, open the door...
- Open the door.

573
00:49:22,185 --> 00:49:24,676
What should we do now?

574
00:49:25,288 --> 00:49:26,619
Go and call the neighbours.

575
00:49:26,890 --> 00:49:28,687
Shout! He's trying to kill himself.

576
00:49:29,192 --> 00:49:31,160
Wait. Stop! Open the door!

577
00:49:43,306 --> 00:49:45,433
What are you doing?
- What are you trying to do?

578
00:49:45,742 --> 00:49:47,835
Who are you all?
- We are your neighbours.

579
00:49:48,211 --> 00:49:51,180
Why have you barged inside my house?
- Tell me what is bothering you?

580
00:49:51,448 --> 00:49:52,608
I am like a mother to you.

581
00:49:52,749 --> 00:49:55,616
Life is an invaluable gift of God.
Don't waste it like this.

582
00:49:55,986 --> 00:49:59,717
Trust my experience. Those who commit
suicide repent it bitterly after death.

583
00:50:00,223 --> 00:50:03,681
Yes, son. Look at me, I still want
to live for another 75 years.

584
00:50:04,227 --> 00:50:06,491
And you've given up to the challenges
of life at such a young age?

585
00:50:06,696 --> 00:50:11,190
Face them bravely.
- Yes, face them bravely.

586
00:50:16,573 --> 00:50:21,203
She's the one who told you everything,
didn't she?

587
00:50:21,511 --> 00:50:24,639
Yes, this innocent girl
saved your life.

588
00:50:25,849 --> 00:50:28,215
What do you want, after all?

589
00:50:29,252 --> 00:50:33,621
I just want to know whether you are
still to consume the rat-poison...

590
00:50:33,924 --> 00:50:35,892
or have you already done it?

591
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:40,229
Listen, you'll have
to promise me that...

592
00:50:40,597 --> 00:50:43,623
you will never contemplate
suicide henceforth

593
00:50:44,501 --> 00:50:46,469
No, I'll never think about it.

594
00:50:47,270 --> 00:50:50,569
But, I want to kill someone.
- Murder?

595
00:50:50,807 --> 00:50:54,709
What weapon should I use?
- Those doe-horns behind you...

596
00:50:57,214 --> 00:50:59,512
anyone would die if
you shove it in him.

597
00:51:05,222 --> 00:51:08,191
But whom do you want to kill?
- You!

598
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,195
Wait... where are you running to?

599
00:51:19,669 --> 00:51:21,534
I'll kill you and go to jail!

600
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:25,538
Stop there!
I'm not sparing you.

601
00:51:30,580 --> 00:51:32,810
I've caught you...
where will you escape now?

602
00:51:34,885 --> 00:51:37,217
Have you gone crazy?
- No!

603
00:51:37,654 --> 00:51:39,622
I have rather come to
my senses now.

604
00:51:40,257 --> 00:51:42,725
You have maligned me in front
of the whole world.

605
00:51:43,426 --> 00:51:45,826
Wherever I go,
people start pitying me.

606
00:51:46,596 --> 00:51:50,828
They say that I am the poor guy
who wants to commit suicide.

607
00:51:52,469 --> 00:51:56,735
And people will keep visiting me
just to check whether...

608
00:51:56,940 --> 00:51:58,669
I am dead or still alive.

609
00:51:59,209 --> 00:52:02,645
I want the world to help me
keeping a tab on you.

610
00:52:03,246 --> 00:52:06,340
I am just wishing good for you.

611
00:52:07,284 --> 00:52:09,514
Speak up, will you wish well for
me ever again?

612
00:52:09,719 --> 00:52:11,687
Till my last breath.

613
00:52:12,656 --> 00:52:13,623
Why?

614
00:52:14,758 --> 00:52:15,850
Why?

615
00:52:18,662 --> 00:52:22,189
Because in today's world, the moment a
person's girlfriend is dead...

616
00:52:22,566 --> 00:52:26,593
he is in another girl's arms
in no time.

617
00:52:27,571 --> 00:52:29,869
And here you are...

618
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:33,209
who wants to give up his
life for Champa's love?

619
00:52:34,444 --> 00:52:36,207
Champa... Champa...

620
00:52:36,546 --> 00:52:39,640
Just see you get so deeply affected
by the mere mention of her name.

621
00:52:40,250 --> 00:52:42,650
Where does one find such
a beloved these days?

622
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:45,880
Tell me, won't someone fall
in love with...

623
00:52:46,256 --> 00:52:48,383
a person who believes so much in love?
I love you.

624
00:52:48,825 --> 00:52:54,161
"In love!"

625
00:52:55,865 --> 00:53:02,168
"In love!"

626
00:53:04,541 --> 00:53:07,339
"In love!"

627
00:53:12,315 --> 00:53:19,585
"What has this love done to me?"

628
00:53:20,690 --> 00:53:23,625
"Something seems to be impending..."

629
00:53:24,294 --> 00:53:27,593
"...something has already happened!"

630
00:53:28,698 --> 00:53:36,195
"My love, you are the goal of
my lovelorn heart."

631
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:43,603
"It doesn't rest in peace without you."

632
00:53:44,581 --> 00:53:51,646
"I have fallen in love with love!"

633
00:53:52,422 --> 00:54:00,158
"My love, you are the goal of
my lovelorn heart."

634
00:54:00,563 --> 00:54:03,327
"In love!"

635
00:54:24,220 --> 00:54:31,626
"These fragrant meetings filled
with nervous emotions."

636
00:54:32,228 --> 00:54:39,725
"Something about you makes
me forget everything."

637
00:54:40,270 --> 00:54:47,608
"This yearning of my loneliness,
scattered all over my rocking dreams..."

638
00:54:48,578 --> 00:54:55,142
"...has kept me engrossed since dusk."

639
00:54:56,519 --> 00:54:59,682
"Such a captivating tale of yours..."

640
00:55:00,190 --> 00:55:03,819
"...makes my heart crave for you!"

641
00:55:04,394 --> 00:55:11,596
"What has this love done to me?"

642
00:55:12,535 --> 00:55:15,766
"Something seems to be impending..."

643
00:55:16,539 --> 00:55:19,702
"...something has already happened!"

644
00:55:20,310 --> 00:55:28,183
"My love, you are the goal of
my lovelorn heart."

645
00:55:28,651 --> 00:55:31,347
"In love!"

646
00:55:54,911 --> 00:55:56,879
What has happened to you today,
Kaajal?

647
00:55:58,181 --> 00:56:00,672
There's this strange
warmth in your love.

648
00:56:06,756 --> 00:56:08,724
You? What are you doing here?

649
00:56:09,259 --> 00:56:11,489
I saw your wife going out.

650
00:56:12,495 --> 00:56:14,463
I thought, I shouldn't loose
this opportunity.

651
00:56:14,731 --> 00:56:16,494
So I came in.

652
00:56:19,536 --> 00:56:23,336
Try jumping in the sea of love once.

653
00:56:24,874 --> 00:56:28,275
One dip in it will never
let you want to come out.

654
00:56:29,679 --> 00:56:32,773
Why are you so much after me?

655
00:56:34,651 --> 00:56:36,448
Even I don't know that.

656
00:56:36,886 --> 00:56:39,252
But I find you very alluring.

657
00:56:41,324 --> 00:56:44,293
Finding you before me makes my heart...

658
00:56:46,429 --> 00:56:48,397
...skip a beat.

659
00:56:49,732 --> 00:56:52,200
Listen, if my wife happens
to come here...

660
00:56:52,569 --> 00:56:55,800
not only are you going to get killed
for sure, she will also kill me.

661
00:56:56,239 --> 00:56:58,571
Such a henpecked man?

662
00:56:59,175 --> 00:57:02,736
Not henpecked. I love her a lot.
- So who's stopping you?

663
00:57:03,179 --> 00:57:07,639
Spend 23 hours with her and
allot me only one hour.

664
00:57:08,184 --> 00:57:09,845
I am head-over-heels in love with you.

665
00:57:10,353 --> 00:57:12,821
She might be back any moment now.

666
00:57:13,523 --> 00:57:15,718
You are being so inhospitable.

667
00:57:16,626 --> 00:57:19,595
Ask for a glass of water, at least.
- Right away.

668
00:57:46,222 --> 00:57:47,849
Here, take this...

669
00:57:48,391 --> 00:57:51,519
What happened?
- Nothing.

670
00:57:53,429 --> 00:57:55,454
For whom is this cold drink?

671
00:57:55,765 --> 00:57:59,132
What do you mean by 'for whom? '
It's for you, sweetheart!

672
00:58:01,170 --> 00:58:04,571
You were out in the sun.
- One doesn't feel the sun in an AC car.

673
00:58:08,578 --> 00:58:10,409
What has happened to, you?

674
00:58:13,182 --> 00:58:14,740
I smell something fishy here.

675
00:58:14,951 --> 00:58:17,715
Fishy? But we have no fish in
the house. How can you smell it?

676
00:58:18,254 --> 00:58:20,620
Wow! What a beautiful dress!

677
00:58:20,990 --> 00:58:24,482
You look so pretty and inviting.
I feel like loving you!

678
00:58:27,196 --> 00:58:28,891
Kishan, what's gone wrong
with you all of a sudden?

679
00:58:29,265 --> 00:58:31,495
Nothing has gone wrong!
It's all intentional.

680
00:58:31,868 --> 00:58:36,168
I really love you... I really
love you, Kaajal.

681
00:58:53,590 --> 00:58:56,184
He is so tensed and here you are,
laughing at him?

682
00:58:56,559 --> 00:58:58,527
What else should I do? Shed tears?

683
00:58:59,228 --> 00:59:03,790
He is one great soul
who wants to steal mangoes...

684
00:59:04,167 --> 00:59:07,295
but is also scared of falling
off from the tree.

685
00:59:07,637 --> 00:59:10,538
Am I interested in Bobby?

686
00:59:10,873 --> 00:59:12,465
Are you asking this or
telling this to me?

687
00:59:12,675 --> 00:59:15,508
None of the two.
I am just cursing my luck...

688
00:59:15,945 --> 00:59:19,244
for having gone to the club with you
and getting trapped in this situation.

689
00:59:19,716 --> 00:59:22,583
I would have been ruined had
Kaajal spotted me.

690
00:59:23,186 --> 00:59:27,816
Is it? I will just call up Bobby
and tell her that Kishan hates her.

691
00:59:28,625 --> 00:59:30,593
Forget your home she won't
step even in your lane.

692
00:59:32,729 --> 00:59:35,493
Just see his face turning pale!

693
00:59:40,203 --> 00:59:42,603
Actually his boring
life suits him well.

694
00:59:43,206 --> 00:59:45,970
The same office, the same home
and the same wife.

695
00:59:48,745 --> 00:59:52,704
Forget bothering about Kaajal
and embrace Bobby.

696
00:59:53,216 --> 00:59:55,184
Do something, at least.

697
00:59:58,655 --> 01:00:02,182
Applying one's mind combined
with smart lies...

698
01:00:02,558 --> 01:00:05,186
will never get a man being caught
by his wife.

699
01:00:11,668 --> 01:00:14,193
Sister, it becomes
very tough for me...

700
01:00:14,504 --> 01:00:16,199
whenever you observe this vow of
silence.

701
01:00:16,406 --> 01:00:18,931
Do you know why is she
crying so bitterly?

702
01:00:19,442 --> 01:00:20,966
Only tomorrow will that be possible.

703
01:00:21,377 --> 01:00:23,675
She has never broken her vow of
silence in all these 7 years.

704
01:00:25,915 --> 01:00:27,883
I might as well come tomorrow.

705
01:00:31,054 --> 01:00:32,385
Listen...

706
01:00:33,256 --> 01:00:36,555
You broke your vow?
- I had to.

707
01:00:37,260 --> 01:00:40,388
Kishan was expressing too much
love, yesterday.

708
01:00:40,797 --> 01:00:43,664
That's good, isn't it?
- Not good. It creates suspicion.

709
01:00:44,267 --> 01:00:47,236
Whenever the quantity of a man's
love undergoes any change...

710
01:00:47,670 --> 01:00:49,638
the wife should consider
having lost him.

711
01:00:50,573 --> 01:00:52,734
I will have to turn a detective
for him now.

712
01:00:53,209 --> 01:00:54,938
Only then will he be
caught red-handed.

713
01:01:13,229 --> 01:01:14,890
Wipe yourself dry, sir.
- Thanks.

714
01:01:18,367 --> 01:01:20,198
How's my little doll?
- I'm fine.

715
01:01:23,906 --> 01:01:26,374
Don't worry at all.
No one will learn about it.

716
01:01:27,310 --> 01:01:29,210
Here... keep this money.

717
01:01:29,579 --> 01:01:32,207
Go on... keep it. I told you that
no one will learn about it.

718
01:01:33,449 --> 01:01:35,815
Just take care of my doll.
I'll leave now. Bye!

719
01:01:36,018 --> 01:01:37,610
Bye, my child!
- Bye!

720
01:01:49,532 --> 01:01:52,228
Kaajal! Kaajal... That... I...
- There is no need to explain!

721
01:01:53,202 --> 01:01:56,660
I have seen everything myself! Since
when has all this been going on?

722
01:01:57,206 --> 01:01:59,174
Kaajal, be positive.
Whatever you're thinking...

723
01:01:59,408 --> 01:02:01,342
It's not that way, Kaajal!
- It is!

724
01:02:01,611 --> 01:02:03,772
You are just what I had thought
you were!

725
01:02:04,213 --> 01:02:06,181
Look, Kaajal, listen to me...
- Just, tell me this...

726
01:02:06,382 --> 01:02:08,350
because I don't know!
What does she have that I don't?

727
01:02:08,551 --> 01:02:09,950
Kaajal, you are not in your senses!

728
01:02:10,319 --> 01:02:12,287
She is a married woman!
She has a child!

729
01:02:12,555 --> 01:02:15,183
So you are having an affair
with a married woman!

730
01:02:19,896 --> 01:02:21,864
According to you, a man and
a woman can have...

731
01:02:22,231 --> 01:02:24,199
just one relationship, isn't it?

732
01:02:24,567 --> 01:02:26,364
Come! Come on!

733
01:02:26,569 --> 01:02:30,198
Do you recognize him?
- Ram Gopal!

734
01:02:31,007 --> 01:02:32,975
Yes, it's Ram Gopal.

735
01:02:34,677 --> 01:02:37,202
He was the chief editor of our
newspaper since the last 8 years.

736
01:02:38,514 --> 01:02:40,209
But do you know why...

737
01:02:40,416 --> 01:02:42,816
he is trying to make these
funny paintings to run his home?

738
01:02:43,719 --> 01:02:46,745
Because he lost both his legs
in an accident 6 months ago!

739
01:02:52,695 --> 01:02:55,664
I really tried to help him.

740
01:02:56,866 --> 01:03:00,165
However, he is a proud man.
He did not agree.

741
01:03:04,807 --> 01:03:06,570
Since they were unable
to pay the fees...

742
01:03:06,709 --> 01:03:08,677
his innocent daughter was
thrown out of school!

743
01:03:09,212 --> 01:03:10,873
These people were almost
on the streets!

744
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:15,239
Since then, I come here discreetly
to help them in some way! And you!

745
01:03:16,018 --> 01:03:18,680
You have crossed all the limits
of suspicion, Kaajal!

746
01:03:19,222 --> 01:03:23,352
I regret having married a woman
like you and ruining my life!

747
01:03:32,401 --> 01:03:35,199
"Everyone likes my face."

748
01:03:36,239 --> 01:03:38,707
"Everyone falls in love with me."

749
01:03:39,909 --> 01:03:42,605
"Everyone likes my face."

750
01:03:43,246 --> 01:03:44,804
Go ahead and drink! Drink, my friend!

751
01:03:45,248 --> 01:03:47,546
Drink this too!
Another 4 doubles, please!

752
01:03:48,317 --> 01:03:50,877
You are not at fault here.
This is the result of...

753
01:03:51,254 --> 01:03:53,745
your wife's suspicion and an
award for your honesty!

754
01:03:55,524 --> 01:03:58,152
There is a limit to suspicion!
A limit to suspicion!

755
01:03:58,527 --> 01:04:01,155
You know, it's understood that
when a man goes out...

756
01:04:01,564 --> 01:04:04,533
he puts a lock on the door.
A person checks once...

757
01:04:04,901 --> 01:04:08,166
or twice but your wife...
she keeps sitting next to the lock!

758
01:04:09,772 --> 01:04:11,740
You are an honest man.
If I was in your place...

759
01:04:11,874 --> 01:04:13,842
I would have sneaked in from the back,
taken everything and...

760
01:04:14,210 --> 01:04:16,735
I would have changed the lock too!
No Entry!

761
01:04:20,283 --> 01:04:23,775
Let me tell you something.
What gives you...

762
01:04:24,220 --> 01:04:27,451
all the grief in this world? A woman!

763
01:04:28,257 --> 01:04:31,192
And who gives you all the
happiness in this world?

764
01:04:31,560 --> 01:04:35,189
A woman! Well, if one woman has
hurt you so much...

765
01:04:35,731 --> 01:04:37,858
let another woman give you
some happiness!

766
01:04:38,401 --> 01:04:41,199
"Love me, honey!"

767
01:04:41,570 --> 01:04:43,538
"Kiss me, honey!"

768
01:04:43,839 --> 01:04:45,431
"There's no one like me!"

769
01:04:45,641 --> 01:04:48,201
Listen to me.
One made you cry with grief.

770
01:04:48,511 --> 01:04:50,672
This one will make
you cry with happiness!

771
01:04:52,648 --> 01:04:55,674
Do you want her?
- No, my friend.

772
01:04:56,185 --> 01:04:58,881
No! Are you crazy?
Just look at her!

773
01:05:02,525 --> 01:05:05,323
I mean, not now.
- Not now, but you do mean...

774
01:05:05,528 --> 01:05:10,158
that you want her, isn't it? Good!
- Tomorrow, Kaajal...

775
01:05:10,933 --> 01:05:12,901
Kaajal is going to Ajmer tomorrow.

776
01:05:13,369 --> 01:05:15,166
She's going?
I'll send her in the morning.

777
01:05:15,471 --> 01:05:17,336
But where will I take her?

778
01:05:17,606 --> 01:05:20,575
Why do you have the guesthouse then?
The guesthouse is made just for her!

779
01:05:22,211 --> 01:05:23,178
"Just me!"

780
01:05:23,379 --> 01:05:26,678
"There's no one like me!
No, no, no, no! Just me!"

781
01:05:49,905 --> 01:05:51,702
Shall I leave?
- Yes, fine.

782
01:05:54,377 --> 01:05:55,469
Kaajal!

783
01:05:57,513 --> 01:05:59,640
I know that I'm not worthy of
your forgiveness.

784
01:06:00,549 --> 01:06:04,645
Please forgive me!
- No, no. It's all right.

785
01:06:05,388 --> 01:06:07,151
I've been with you since
so many years.

786
01:06:07,323 --> 01:06:09,154
But I've never understood you!

787
01:06:12,528 --> 01:06:14,826
I have never valued your love!
- Kaajal!

788
01:06:16,265 --> 01:06:19,666
But I've realised my mistake after
last night's incident.

789
01:06:20,536 --> 01:06:24,495
I've realised that you can never even
look at another woman!

790
01:06:27,410 --> 01:06:29,844
Please get up.
- I promise that...

791
01:06:30,379 --> 01:06:32,847
I'll never doubt you again. Never!

792
01:06:34,383 --> 01:06:38,717
I would have probably never doubted
you had I given you a child!

793
01:06:39,889 --> 01:06:42,357
But I don't know why
I have this fear...

794
01:06:43,225 --> 01:06:45,693
that your desire of fatherhood might
compel you to desert me!

795
01:06:50,399 --> 01:06:54,802
Kishan! I cannot live without my love!
I just cannot!

796
01:06:55,371 --> 01:06:57,464
Look... Look, you are going to Ajmer,
isn't it?

797
01:06:57,673 --> 01:06:59,641
Everything will be all right.
Be positive!

798
01:07:00,976 --> 01:07:03,604
On reaching there, I'll pray not
only for my child...

799
01:07:04,180 --> 01:07:06,148
but for our relationship as well.

800
01:07:07,249 --> 01:07:09,513
I feel that someone has cast an evil
eye on our relationship.

801
01:07:18,360 --> 01:07:21,158
Lakshmi!
- I've called her. Look Lakshmi...

802
01:07:21,363 --> 01:07:23,331
Sir should have his meals on time.

803
01:07:23,732 --> 01:07:26,166
I know that once I am gone, you'll
eat outside.

804
01:07:26,869 --> 01:07:29,167
And one falls ill after eating outside.

805
01:07:29,605 --> 01:07:32,836
And when I come back, I want to see you
just the way you are now. Ah, yes!

806
01:07:33,542 --> 01:07:36,170
If his head or hand hurt, massage them.

807
01:07:37,213 --> 01:07:39,681
There is nothing wrong in that.
Okay, go and work.

808
01:07:40,683 --> 01:07:44,676
Oh! My bag! Look,
I have kept some clothes...

809
01:07:45,387 --> 01:07:47,685
for Ram Gopal and his family.
Please give them to him... Please!

810
01:07:52,228 --> 01:07:53,786
Why... why are you taking my picture?

811
01:07:54,163 --> 01:07:56,461
Well, will I be able to stay
without you for 2 days?

812
01:07:56,899 --> 01:07:59,129
I'll just be back.
- You mean...

813
01:07:59,735 --> 01:08:01,566
you are going, isn't it?

814
01:08:01,737 --> 01:08:03,329
Of course!
But one must not say that.

815
01:08:03,506 --> 01:08:06,134
But it creates confusion!
- Okay.

816
01:08:06,675 --> 01:08:08,472
I'll be off.

817
01:08:19,922 --> 01:08:23,153
Yes, Kishan, shoot! What?
The programme is cancelled!

818
01:08:24,326 --> 01:08:27,159
Put your snap too, Pooja.

819
01:08:28,697 --> 01:08:33,657
Yes. What happened?
- I don't feel like cheating on her.

820
01:08:34,870 --> 01:08:36,167
She loves me very much.

821
01:08:36,639 --> 01:08:38,664
That's because you're getting
such a big contract...

822
01:08:39,275 --> 01:08:41,334
for the first time. Look at me!
I have no fear!

823
01:08:41,744 --> 01:08:43,405
I'm used to it. I'm used to it, man!

824
01:08:43,612 --> 01:08:47,173
No, Prem, I don't feel right
going into a 'No Entry'!

825
01:08:48,217 --> 01:08:50,685
These shortcuts are not for me,
my friend.

826
01:08:51,320 --> 01:08:54,118
I'll take the main road
as I usually do.

827
01:08:54,590 --> 01:08:57,787
Well, brother, one must never
let a good opportunity pass!

828
01:08:58,327 --> 01:09:00,795
Isn't that right, Pooja?
- Yes, brother, he's absolutely right!

829
01:09:01,330 --> 01:09:03,457
Did you hear that? And listen...

830
01:09:04,166 --> 01:09:05,633
That party must be reaching
at any minute.

831
01:09:05,801 --> 01:09:07,792
Oh my God!
- Why are you scared?

832
01:09:08,671 --> 01:09:11,469
Meet her with full confidence!
And impress her so much...

833
01:09:12,875 --> 01:09:14,604
that whenever she does business...
she does it only with you!

834
01:09:14,777 --> 01:09:17,143
Hello! Prem, look...
- I'm going to South Africa today.

835
01:09:22,184 --> 01:09:24,652
Look now, don't waste
my hundred thousand.

836
01:09:25,487 --> 01:09:27,318
One hundred thousand!
- Yes!

837
01:09:28,591 --> 01:09:31,151
But there's a guarantee that
you'll feel...

838
01:09:31,427 --> 01:09:33,156
that the job was worth one million!

839
01:09:33,362 --> 01:09:35,330
And I'm telling you with
full experience that...

840
01:09:35,497 --> 01:09:37,397
this party is fantastic!
I'll hang up now.

841
01:10:24,980 --> 01:10:27,210
Sorry, I'm a bit late.

842
01:10:29,451 --> 01:10:31,544
Look... I was saying. Bobby...

843
01:10:33,455 --> 01:10:36,219
Can we have this programme
some other day?

844
01:10:40,262 --> 01:10:44,221
You sat down!
- I've kept 100 people waiting for you!

845
01:10:44,667 --> 01:10:46,601
And you are trying to chase
me from here!

846
01:10:48,070 --> 01:10:50,402
The money that Prem had given you...
I'm not asking you to return it.

847
01:10:51,807 --> 01:10:54,571
What do you think?
I've come to you for the 25,000?

848
01:10:55,477 --> 01:10:57,502
25,000.
He told me it's a hundred thousand!

849
01:10:58,547 --> 01:11:02,677
25,000 rupees! I can refuse
it 2,500 times for you!

850
01:11:03,585 --> 01:11:07,351
Because it's not money but love
that's between us!

851
01:11:08,223 --> 01:11:11,556
It's a matter of the heart!
It's a secret!

852
01:11:12,227 --> 01:11:15,196
A secret!
Let the secret remain a secret!

853
01:11:15,664 --> 01:11:17,689
Please... Please, go away from here.

854
01:11:21,236 --> 01:11:24,694
Where is the washroom?
- Washroom? ...There.

855
01:11:27,776 --> 01:11:30,870
Listen to me.
Come out fast, please.

856
01:11:31,246 --> 01:11:32,975
5 minutes.
- Fast! Fast!

857
01:11:38,787 --> 01:11:42,883
Oops! I forgot my ticket at home!
Driver, take the car home.

858
01:12:31,306 --> 01:12:34,207
"Why are you going having stolen
my heart?"

859
01:12:35,577 --> 01:12:38,705
"What makes you trouble me like this?"

860
01:12:39,581 --> 01:12:42,709
"Why are you going having stolen
my heart?"

861
01:12:43,752 --> 01:12:46,721
"What makes you trouble me like this?"

862
01:12:47,823 --> 01:12:51,224
"I've been waiting for you
since so long."

863
01:12:52,060 --> 01:12:55,496
"Why do you refuse to come close?"

864
01:13:04,573 --> 01:13:08,168
Lakshmi! Where is your master?
- He's gone to the guesthouse.

865
01:13:23,225 --> 01:13:26,683
"Both of us are full of desire!"

866
01:13:27,229 --> 01:13:30,721
"This distance makes us
grow impatient!"

867
01:13:34,536 --> 01:13:36,731
"O' my darling!"

868
01:13:39,741 --> 01:13:44,201
"Our breaths are afire!"

869
01:13:46,915 --> 01:13:48,212
"Sweetheart..."

870
01:13:52,254 --> 01:13:55,155
"The surroundings are weaving magic!"

871
01:13:56,191 --> 01:13:59,319
"Both of us are wanton!"

872
01:14:00,195 --> 01:14:03,494
"I'm casting my spell over you!"

873
01:14:04,433 --> 01:14:07,664
"I've been waiting for you
since so long."

874
01:14:08,537 --> 01:14:11,665
"Why do you refuse to come close?"

875
01:14:12,708 --> 01:14:15,677
"Why are you going having stolen my
heart?"

876
01:14:16,745 --> 01:14:20,181
"What makes you trouble me like this?"

877
01:14:59,721 --> 01:15:01,279
Why did you take so long
to open the door?

878
01:15:01,456 --> 01:15:05,654
I was in the bathroom...
I'm not feeling well.

879
01:15:05,894 --> 01:15:07,486
That is why I couldn't hear the bell.

880
01:15:13,402 --> 01:15:16,496
But what are you doing here?
- What am I doing here? Yes...

881
01:15:16,738 --> 01:15:18,831
I've heard that there's going
to be an income-tax raid.

882
01:15:19,207 --> 01:15:21,175
That's why I had come here to
hide the files...

883
01:15:21,343 --> 01:15:23,174
in the bathroom.
- In the bathroom?

884
01:15:24,513 --> 01:15:26,344
They'll be wet in there!

885
01:15:27,215 --> 01:15:30,184
Don't worry!
I know what should be hidden where!

886
01:15:31,219 --> 01:15:33,187
But, you're here!
- I just forgot my ticket.

887
01:15:33,755 --> 01:15:35,723
Then I remembered that
you also forgot...

888
01:15:36,224 --> 01:15:38,192
to give me money to make an offering.

889
01:15:40,429 --> 01:15:43,364
Well! I'm also a little... forgetful!

890
01:15:46,902 --> 01:15:48,699
Why are your hands trembling so much?

891
01:15:49,905 --> 01:15:53,466
Well... I'm not feeling well.
I'm feeling a bit cold too!

892
01:15:54,643 --> 01:15:58,135
That's strange! Where is Sunny?
- Sunny!

893
01:15:58,347 --> 01:16:00,144
Sunny has gone to get my medicines.

894
01:16:00,315 --> 01:16:02,146
Better move or you will
miss the flight.

895
01:16:02,317 --> 01:16:04,148
C'mon, let's go.

896
01:16:16,665 --> 01:16:20,157
A 'ladies' sandal?
- Is it a lady's sandal?

897
01:16:21,436 --> 01:16:24,166
Can't you see?
- It is a ladies sandal.

898
01:16:24,740 --> 01:16:27,174
Whose is it?
- Must be of some lady.

899
01:16:27,609 --> 01:16:31,170
I know that but whose is it?
- That... That...

900
01:16:31,747 --> 01:16:34,181
We'll have to ask Sunny.
I'll ask him.

901
01:16:34,449 --> 01:16:36,349
You must leave, darling.
Or you'll miss the flight!

902
01:16:45,594 --> 01:16:47,186
This jacket?

903
01:16:48,930 --> 01:16:51,694
Jacket...?
It surely belongs to Sunny.

904
01:16:52,701 --> 01:16:54,328
It's a ladies jacket.

905
01:16:54,503 --> 01:16:56,869
Ladies... it can't belong
to Sunny then.

906
01:16:57,706 --> 01:17:00,140
Then who could it belong to?
- That...

907
01:17:00,909 --> 01:17:02,638
We'll have to ask Sunny that as well!

908
01:17:10,485 --> 01:17:13,147
You doubt me, isn't it?
You are doubting me again!

909
01:17:14,856 --> 01:17:16,517
Does this house belong to me? Yes,
it is.

910
01:17:16,692 --> 01:17:19,490
I mean, it belongs to us. But...
but it's Sunny who stays here!

911
01:17:19,928 --> 01:17:22,158
What Sunny does here...
why does he keep a ladies jacket?

912
01:17:22,330 --> 01:17:24,161
How am I supposed to know that?
- I was just asking.

913
01:17:24,366 --> 01:17:26,834
I did not doubt you.
- But I'm the one who is hurt!

914
01:17:27,736 --> 01:17:29,363
It is my heart that is burning!

915
01:17:29,538 --> 01:17:31,665
I do feel that you doubt me!

916
01:17:34,609 --> 01:17:37,305
Okay, I'll leave or
I'll miss the flight.

917
01:17:37,913 --> 01:17:39,847
Okay, leave.

918
01:17:52,227 --> 01:17:53,785
Cockroach!

919
01:18:08,543 --> 01:18:11,137
Who is she?
- She is... she is...

920
01:18:11,646 --> 01:18:15,138
Yes, tell me. Or will I have to ask
Sunny about this!

921
01:18:15,650 --> 01:18:19,609
Sunny! Kaajal, what I was saying...
- What were you saying?

922
01:18:20,188 --> 01:18:23,157
Is she the same... Income tax file?

923
01:18:26,661 --> 01:18:30,654
I had just begun trusting you, Kishan.
And as soon as I left...

924
01:18:33,401 --> 01:18:35,164
You cheated on me in such a big way!

925
01:18:35,504 --> 01:18:37,665
I haven't cheated on you.
- So, why don't you tell me?

926
01:18:38,206 --> 01:18:42,165
Who is she? What is she doing here?
- What is this, brother? You just...

927
01:19:12,908 --> 01:19:18,141
Idiot! And duffer! You're in trouble!
- In trouble?

928
01:19:19,214 --> 01:19:21,876
I told you so many times not to
hide anything from Kaajal.

929
01:19:23,652 --> 01:19:25,142
What have I hidden?
- What have you hidden?

930
01:19:25,353 --> 01:19:28,151
Tell her the truth now at least!
She doubts me!

931
01:19:29,958 --> 01:19:32,324
What do I tell her?
- What will you tell her? I'll tell her.

932
01:19:32,527 --> 01:19:35,690
Kaajal, this is Bobby... Sunny's wife.

933
01:19:44,639 --> 01:19:51,169
Wife! When did you get married, Sunny?
- Uh... just now.

934
01:19:52,214 --> 01:19:55,513
What do you mean by 'just now'?
- I mean... just now...

935
01:19:56,384 --> 01:19:59,182
About a week ago...
A week... Just a week back.

936
01:20:01,389 --> 01:20:03,357
She's not wearing a 'mangalsutra'!
- How can she?

937
01:20:03,959 --> 01:20:05,688
Why can't she?

938
01:20:06,695 --> 01:20:08,526
Bobby... Bobby...

939
01:20:08,697 --> 01:20:10,528
Bobby is Christian, you see.
- Yes.

940
01:20:11,233 --> 01:20:14,600
They wear a ring.
- They wear rings, you know!

941
01:20:14,769 --> 01:20:15,861
Christianity...

942
01:20:16,238 --> 01:20:18,206
But why did you hide this from me?

943
01:20:20,609 --> 01:20:22,577
Ask him. Tell her, brother!

944
01:20:23,612 --> 01:20:26,706
Actually, Bobby's brother is
an underworld don.

945
01:20:27,749 --> 01:20:30,217
He was against their love.
And they got married.

946
01:20:30,585 --> 01:20:32,553
Now he's roaming around openly
with a knife!

947
01:20:32,754 --> 01:20:34,551
He says that he wants to kill
his brother-in-law...

948
01:20:34,723 --> 01:20:36,554
and make his sister a widow!

949
01:20:40,495 --> 01:20:44,226
You've locked up such a pretty and
innocent girl since so many days!

950
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:48,735
You both fell in love and got married.
You've not committed a sin...

951
01:20:48,937 --> 01:20:51,235
to get so scared! Who is her brother?
I'll talk to him!

952
01:20:52,540 --> 01:20:54,508
Kaajal... why will you take the trouble?

953
01:20:54,676 --> 01:20:56,644
I will... I will take care of it.
- Kishan, I...

954
01:20:56,878 --> 01:21:00,177
Be positive! You must leave or you'll
miss the flight.

955
01:21:00,382 --> 01:21:02,179
Ah, yes! Bye!

956
01:21:02,751 --> 01:21:04,685
Call me as soon as you land!

957
01:21:06,688 --> 01:21:08,656
You saved me today!

958
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:16,690
Hadn't I told you not to make a sound?
And you screamed!?

959
01:21:17,933 --> 01:21:19,867
I had forbidden you even to peep
from the bathroom!

960
01:21:20,235 --> 01:21:22,703
And you came right out!
- There was a cockroach in the bathroom.

961
01:21:22,938 --> 01:21:25,532
Would it have eaten you?
- I got scared.

962
01:21:26,441 --> 01:21:28,204
You got scared!

963
01:21:28,410 --> 01:21:32,540
If my wife's suspicions had been
confirmed today, you know...

964
01:21:33,615 --> 01:21:35,583
I would have ended up spending
the rest of my life...

965
01:21:35,784 --> 01:21:37,547
in terror in my own house!

966
01:21:38,820 --> 01:21:42,722
Why are you scared now?
She's gone, isn't it? You're saved!

967
01:21:46,428 --> 01:21:48,555
Please! Please! Go from here.

968
01:21:58,440 --> 01:22:01,170
What happened, Sunny?
- I had thought you were an upright man.

969
01:22:01,476 --> 01:22:04,673
I am an upright man, my friend!
- Bye, handsome!

970
01:22:07,716 --> 01:22:09,684
Yes! I can see it!

971
01:22:10,552 --> 01:22:12,679
If you hadn't done so many favours
for me I would have printed...

972
01:22:12,887 --> 01:22:15,685
such a big picture of yours
in the newspaper.

973
01:22:16,224 --> 01:22:19,352
Sunny, I haven't done anything.
I really haven't done anything.

974
01:22:19,894 --> 01:22:21,361
Prem is responsible for all this!

975
01:22:26,801 --> 01:22:28,701
But why did you have to call her
my wife in front of Kaajal?

976
01:22:28,903 --> 01:22:30,200
Should I have called her
my wife instead?

977
01:22:30,338 --> 01:22:33,205
You could have called her my girlfriend.
So that, tomorrow...

978
01:22:34,409 --> 01:22:36,377
I could at least say that she left me,
ran away or died!

979
01:22:36,745 --> 01:22:38,713
You called her my wife!

980
01:22:39,748 --> 01:22:41,716
How do I get rid of my wife now?

981
01:22:42,250 --> 01:22:44,548
What if Sanjana learns about this
so-called wife?

982
01:22:44,753 --> 01:22:46,721
She won't come to know, Sunny.
Whatever has happened...

983
01:22:46,921 --> 01:22:50,220
has happened within these 4 walls!
Just between 4 people!

984
01:22:51,259 --> 01:22:54,160
And I made her your wife. Therefore,
I'll only get the two of you divorced!

985
01:22:55,830 --> 01:22:58,822
I mean, I'd like to see my look-alike.
What is his name? Sh... Sh...

986
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:00,497
Shekhar.
- Yes, Shekhar. Mr. Shekhar...

987
01:23:00,668 --> 01:23:02,499
Just come here for a minute,
Sweety. Well...

988
01:23:02,871 --> 01:23:06,170
Ms. Nisha, I wanted to ask you something.
Does he really...

989
01:23:06,741 --> 01:23:10,177
Does he really look like me?
- Absolutely! He looks just like you.

990
01:23:10,478 --> 01:23:13,504
Then it's very important to meet him.
I'll call him.

991
01:23:13,915 --> 01:23:15,678
He's gone to office

992
01:23:16,217 --> 01:23:19,186
Okay... how do you know that
he's gone to office?

993
01:23:21,456 --> 01:23:25,187
He's lying to both his wives and
you're enjoying it!

994
01:23:27,595 --> 01:23:32,532
You can stop me from lying.
How can I ask Govinda not to lie?

995
01:23:33,234 --> 01:23:35,361
Why do you have to whistle
when he is lying?

996
01:23:36,738 --> 01:23:41,698
You intend getting married twice!
Lying is no sin for you! Shut up!

997
01:23:43,344 --> 01:23:45,710
That's why you're enjoying so much
and whistling so loudly!

998
01:23:46,247 --> 01:23:48,215
Go out and fight!
- Shut up!

999
01:23:48,483 --> 01:23:51,213
Go and lie! Keep doing that!
Marry twice! Whistle!

1000
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:55,822
We are finished from today!
- But... have you gone crazy?

1001
01:23:56,558 --> 01:23:58,651
For such a small thing, you...
- Is this a small for you?

1002
01:23:59,594 --> 01:24:04,497
Listen to me! Sanjana... Sanjana...
I promise that from today...

1003
01:24:04,899 --> 01:24:06,833
I'll never enjoy such scenes!

1004
01:24:08,870 --> 01:24:11,634
I'll never watch such films!
Please forgive me.

1005
01:24:13,708 --> 01:24:14,504
On one condition!

1006
01:24:15,577 --> 01:24:17,511
You will have to ask my father for
my hand in marriage.

1007
01:24:18,279 --> 01:24:20,679
Just the hand!
I want the entire Sanjana!

1008
01:24:22,217 --> 01:24:23,184
Dog!

1009
01:24:25,687 --> 01:24:28,349
Okay... fine.
- Kaajal, ever since you're back...

1010
01:24:28,723 --> 01:24:30,850
from Ajmer you're just involved in this
'best couple' function!

1011
01:24:31,359 --> 01:24:33,327
What do I do? The responsibility
is entirely on me!

1012
01:24:34,229 --> 01:24:36,197
I've already found 3 couples.
However, I can't understand...

1013
01:24:36,397 --> 01:24:40,857
what to do about the 4th! Ah, yes!
How about our Sunny and Bobby?

1014
01:24:41,402 --> 01:24:45,202
They will be very good! No, no!
How can both of them come together?

1015
01:24:45,406 --> 01:24:46,532
Why?

1016
01:24:47,408 --> 01:24:49,706
Well...
- You think so much before speaking...

1017
01:24:50,245 --> 01:24:51,872
that unwittingly I start
doubting you!

1018
01:24:52,247 --> 01:24:55,148
Be positive, darling! Actually...
Actually, both had a fight.

1019
01:24:55,617 --> 01:24:57,642
And Bobby has gone to her
brother's place.

1020
01:24:58,186 --> 01:24:59,813
It's not even been 4 days since
they're married...

1021
01:25:00,188 --> 01:25:01,177
and Sunny has already
started fighting!

1022
01:25:01,356 --> 01:25:05,315
The poor girl is so nice!
- We know how nice she really is!

1023
01:25:05,593 --> 01:25:06,560
What?

1024
01:25:06,728 --> 01:25:09,162
I mean, we both know what a nice girl
she is, isn't it?

1025
01:25:09,531 --> 01:25:11,499
But he feels she is trouble!
He won't go!

1026
01:25:11,699 --> 01:25:13,496
All right! I'll call him then.

1027
01:25:15,737 --> 01:25:20,174
Listen! Look... He's already
very unhappy. He'll be tensed too!

1028
01:25:20,542 --> 01:25:23,170
I'll talk to him. I'll try...
- No trying!

1029
01:25:23,478 --> 01:25:26,174
Both should come for the function Or
I'll reach Bobby's place!

1030
01:25:26,381 --> 01:25:28,542
What?
- Yes!

1031
01:25:30,552 --> 01:25:33,521
Sir! Hi!
Good that you called me here.

1032
01:25:34,589 --> 01:25:37,353
Sunny, we hold a 'best couple'
competition every year.

1033
01:25:37,792 --> 01:25:42,195
This year, Kaajal has registered
yours and Bobby's name.

1034
01:25:44,966 --> 01:25:46,763
You and Bobby will have to pretend...

1035
01:25:48,340 --> 01:25:50,934
to be husband and wife for just
a couple of hours in that function...

1036
01:25:54,079 --> 01:25:57,048
Hey! Where are you going?
What happened to you?

1037
01:25:57,482 --> 01:25:59,677
Who are you?
- What!

1038
01:26:00,152 --> 01:26:01,881
How are we related?

1039
01:26:02,154 --> 01:26:04,054
What right do you have
to ask me for help?

1040
01:26:04,456 --> 01:26:06,890
Hey! You just said that you could
even lay down your life for me!

1041
01:26:07,025 --> 01:26:08,549
Yes! So will you really
kill me for that?

1042
01:26:08,927 --> 01:26:10,895
But, Sunny... look...
- No!

1043
01:26:11,096 --> 01:26:13,394
What did you say the other day?
'Whatever has happened... '

1044
01:26:13,598 --> 01:26:16,226
'has happened within these 4 walls.
Just 4 people know about it.'

1045
01:26:16,501 --> 01:26:18,901
Now you want to announce this to the
entire city of Goa that she is my wife?

1046
01:26:20,138 --> 01:26:21,901
Look... look, brother...
You can't understand.

1047
01:26:22,074 --> 01:26:23,564
You can't understand, brother.

1048
01:26:23,942 --> 01:26:27,241
Sanjana hates lies and you're
asking me to lie in public.

1049
01:26:28,347 --> 01:26:32,408
You don't know... Judo, Karate, Kung Fu...
she knows everything!

1050
01:26:32,617 --> 01:26:36,075
I know. But what will happen
if Kaajal finds out the truth?

1051
01:26:38,156 --> 01:26:40,124
She tries to kill herself for
the smallest of things!

1052
01:26:41,493 --> 01:26:43,461
Will she be able to handle
something so big?

1053
01:26:43,962 --> 01:26:46,430
She'll kill herself!
She will die!

1054
01:26:48,133 --> 01:26:52,866
Look, brother... help me one last time.
- If Sanjana comes to know about it...

1055
01:26:53,572 --> 01:26:55,199
this will anyway be the last time
that I'll help you!

1056
01:26:55,407 --> 01:26:57,534
To get out of this problem, we will...

1057
01:26:58,076 --> 01:27:01,534
I can't see any way out for myself!
In fact, I'm getting more into trouble!

1058
01:27:02,481 --> 01:27:05,882
I had come to take you along with
me to Sanjana's place...

1059
01:27:06,284 --> 01:27:08,878
and talk about our marriage.
- We will talk! We will go to her place!

1060
01:27:09,087 --> 01:27:11,055
Be positive!
Everything will be fine!

1061
01:27:11,923 --> 01:27:16,257
How?
- I've learnt how to lie.

1062
01:27:16,928 --> 01:27:18,896
I'll get you and Sanjana married!

1063
01:27:19,731 --> 01:27:21,221
Are you lying to me by any chance?

1064
01:27:21,400 --> 01:27:23,368
No, my friend!
You are my younger brother!

1065
01:27:36,681 --> 01:27:39,081
There's a problem.
- Another problem?

1066
01:27:40,185 --> 01:27:42,085
No one knows her address here.
She's also not been coming...

1067
01:27:42,254 --> 01:27:43,915
to the club since the last
couple of days.

1068
01:27:44,089 --> 01:27:46,057
I think she must be busy
with another party!

1069
01:27:46,725 --> 01:27:50,422
So you know her schedule too!
- We must find her.

1070
01:27:51,129 --> 01:27:52,994
Where?
- In the entire city!

1071
01:27:57,644 --> 01:27:59,942
"Where are you?"

1072
01:28:02,482 --> 01:28:03,949
"Where are you?"

1073
01:28:26,005 --> 01:28:28,303
"Hi, gorgeous!"

1074
01:28:43,056 --> 01:28:44,318
"Where are you?"

1075
01:28:44,757 --> 01:28:45,985
"Where are you?"

1076
01:28:50,330 --> 01:28:52,992
"We are lost in your love!"

1077
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:55,262
"Where are you?"

1078
01:28:57,637 --> 01:28:59,935
"We are lost in your love!"

1079
01:29:01,374 --> 01:29:02,932
"We wild and whacky."

1080
01:29:03,242 --> 01:29:06,609
"Unconcerned with the world."

1081
01:29:06,979 --> 01:29:11,939
"We have been searching for you
everywhere."

1082
01:29:19,425 --> 01:29:20,949
"Where are you?"

1083
01:29:21,160 --> 01:29:22,957
"Where are you?"

1084
01:29:34,140 --> 01:29:35,971
"Hi, gorgeous!"

1085
01:30:03,703 --> 01:30:08,936
"No one understands our pain!"

1086
01:30:12,712 --> 01:30:17,445
"Who should we share our grief with?"

1087
01:30:21,988 --> 01:30:26,948
"Where can we find the shore?"

1088
01:30:30,997 --> 01:30:35,957
"Having lost both the worlds!"

1089
01:30:40,039 --> 01:30:45,978
"We should your name aloud on the
streets!"

1090
01:30:53,953 --> 01:30:56,251
"Where are you"

1091
01:30:57,690 --> 01:31:00,250
"We are lost in your love!"

1092
01:31:16,742 --> 01:31:20,178
Hey! Go on! Get lost!
I can't pretend to be a wife!

1093
01:31:20,346 --> 01:31:23,611
Be positive! We're ready to pay
as much money you want.

1094
01:31:25,151 --> 01:31:27,949
But, I'm going out of town with
him for 3 days.

1095
01:31:28,654 --> 01:31:30,281
Yes, let's go.
- Look, brother...

1096
01:31:30,456 --> 01:31:31,946
it's very important that
she come with us today.

1097
01:31:32,158 --> 01:31:34,456
It's equally important for her
to come with me today.

1098
01:31:34,994 --> 01:31:37,292
Brother, you can't understand!
- It's you who can't understand!

1099
01:31:37,797 --> 01:31:39,958
I've been trying to get into a
'No Entry' since so many days.

1100
01:31:40,333 --> 01:31:42,130
I've finally got an entry today and
you want me to do that tomorrow!

1101
01:31:42,368 --> 01:31:44,393
So you won't relent?
- Impossible!

1102
01:31:44,570 --> 01:31:47,300
Will you understand if we hit you?
- Look... This is illegal!

1103
01:31:47,807 --> 01:31:49,297
So all this is legal?

1104
01:31:49,675 --> 01:31:52,974
My wife will divorce me if she
doesn't come with me today!

1105
01:31:54,313 --> 01:31:57,077
Your wife will divorce you
if she doesn't go with you today!

1106
01:31:57,950 --> 01:32:03,911
But brother, swear by Reliance that you
will make your wife meet mine once...

1107
01:32:05,291 --> 01:32:07,259
so that she also learns
something from her!

1108
01:32:10,630 --> 01:32:12,598
This applause tells us that you all
are really enjoying...

1109
01:32:12,965 --> 01:32:17,425
the spicy question and answer rounds
of all the couples here.

1110
01:32:18,971 --> 01:32:21,940
You tell me... what is the difference
you have experienced...

1111
01:32:22,141 --> 01:32:23,938
between the nuptial night
and the nights after?

1112
01:32:25,511 --> 01:32:28,446
I think that the husband gradually
becomes less of a romantic.

1113
01:32:28,648 --> 01:32:29,945
Really?
- Yeah!

1114
01:32:31,651 --> 01:32:33,619
Mrs. Shekhar, what is the difference
that you've experienced?

1115
01:32:34,654 --> 01:32:36,952
Nothing at all! For me, every night
is a nuptial night!

1116
01:32:43,129 --> 01:32:46,292
What she means to say is...
since the day we got married...

1117
01:32:46,999 --> 01:32:50,332
each night has been like the nuptial
night for us.

1118
01:32:54,607 --> 01:33:00,910
Okay, tell me. In these expensive times,
should it be only the husband...

1119
01:33:01,113 --> 01:33:04,082
who should earn or the wife as well?
- Both!

1120
01:33:05,618 --> 01:33:07,552
The man should earn during the day
and the woman at night.

1121
01:33:12,291 --> 01:33:16,921
Superb! What a reply that was!
It means that the man should toil...

1122
01:33:17,196 --> 01:33:21,428
during the day. And when he comes
home tired at night...

1123
01:33:21,968 --> 01:33:25,426
the wife should serve him
and earn his love!

1124
01:33:26,706 --> 01:33:28,606
Isn't that what you want to say?
- Give me the mike!

1125
01:33:28,975 --> 01:33:30,602
No, no! It's done.
It was the right answer.

1126
01:33:30,977 --> 01:33:32,444
Let's applaud!

1127
01:33:36,148 --> 01:33:42,951
May Mr. Gupta be praised!

1128
01:33:43,522 --> 01:33:45,490
May Mr. Gupta...
- Enough!

1129
01:33:46,192 --> 01:33:47,955
Greetings!
- Greetings! Welcome, Mr. Gupta.

1130
01:33:48,160 --> 01:33:50,458
Please come, Please sit here.

1131
01:34:02,108 --> 01:34:05,236
I've seen her somewhere.
- No, sir.

1132
01:34:05,478 --> 01:34:08,413
This girl is not from this city.
- I've seen her very closely.

1133
01:34:10,116 --> 01:34:11,913
Where?

1134
01:34:30,136 --> 01:34:31,933
I have seen her.
I'll just be back in a second.

1135
01:34:37,977 --> 01:34:41,435
The decision of the judges is here.
And as all of us had expected...

1136
01:34:41,981 --> 01:34:45,940
the award for the best couple goes to
Mr. And Mrs. Shekhar!

1137
01:34:58,431 --> 01:35:01,229
You really deserve this award!
Superb!

1138
01:35:14,146 --> 01:35:16,410
Brothers and sisters,
I'm really pleased to be here.

1139
01:35:17,216 --> 01:35:20,913
I really liked your programme.

1140
01:35:22,455 --> 01:35:24,286
Your job is done.

1141
01:35:24,623 --> 01:35:26,591
Do you remember?
- I do remember, Sunny.

1142
01:35:27,193 --> 01:35:29,093
Sunday, at 11 o'clock at Judge Saxena's
residence, isn't it?

1143
01:35:29,295 --> 01:35:32,264
I do remember.
- Judge! Are you in some kind of trouble?

1144
01:35:35,301 --> 01:35:36,928
Shekhar is just like
my younger brother.

1145
01:35:37,636 --> 01:35:39,934
Had it not been for him,
I wouldn't have existed!

1146
01:35:40,239 --> 01:35:42,230
I mean, my newspaper would
have not existed.

1147
01:35:42,975 --> 01:35:46,103
It's due to his hard work and honesty
that my newspaper is successful today.

1148
01:35:46,312 --> 01:35:48,940
That's why I want to make him my
business partner.

1149
01:35:50,082 --> 01:35:51,049
Great!

1150
01:35:51,250 --> 01:35:53,218
But you've come alone for
such a joyous occasion.

1151
01:35:53,919 --> 01:35:55,386
Why didn't you bring your wife along?

1152
01:35:55,554 --> 01:35:56,885
She won't be able to come for
the wedding as well!

1153
01:35:57,089 --> 01:35:58,056
Why?

1154
01:35:58,457 --> 01:36:00,891
You see. Tell them, brother.

1155
01:36:01,594 --> 01:36:04,062
Actually, my wife doesn't
keep too well.

1156
01:36:04,363 --> 01:36:08,891
But Shekhar and you were just
talking about something.

1157
01:36:10,069 --> 01:36:16,907
Well... I won't hide anything from you...
My wife is a bit mentally unwell.

1158
01:36:19,145 --> 01:36:23,081
You see... she saw the World Trade
Centre crumbling from quite close!

1159
01:36:23,349 --> 01:36:26,580
9/11... your wife was in America then?

1160
01:36:27,286 --> 01:36:30,255
No, she saw it on TV.
- On TV!

1161
01:36:32,324 --> 01:36:35,919
That's it. She's been so badly
affected by that incident...

1162
01:36:36,128 --> 01:36:38,426
that it may be quite risky to
bring her to the wedding!

1163
01:36:39,298 --> 01:36:40,925
One never knows what she might
end up doing!

1164
01:36:41,100 --> 01:36:42,590
That's all right.

1165
01:36:42,968 --> 01:36:44,936
Priest, you're taking so long to
find an auspicious time!

1166
01:36:46,580 --> 01:36:48,343
Brother, you're getting
better and better!

1167
01:36:48,516 --> 01:36:49,483
What do you mean?

1168
01:36:49,617 --> 01:36:52,677
If you continue lying this way,
you'll beat brother Prem one day!

1169
01:36:55,690 --> 01:36:58,124
What happened?
- My right eye has started...

1170
01:36:58,559 --> 01:37:00,356
twitching suddenly.
Will something go wrong?

1171
01:37:00,528 --> 01:37:02,496
Something goes wrong only if the
left eye twitches.

1172
01:37:04,331 --> 01:37:06,299
But why my eye?

1173
01:37:07,368 --> 01:37:09,962
Come on, move!
- Look, Inspector...

1174
01:37:10,171 --> 01:37:11,536
I'm not that kind of a girl!

1175
01:37:11,672 --> 01:37:13,970
Then what kind of a girl are you?
- Very decent and respectable...

1176
01:37:14,341 --> 01:37:16,969
and I belong to a good family.
- So what are you doing in this hotel?

1177
01:37:17,545 --> 01:37:20,480
Well... I had a fight with my husband.
That's why I came here.

1178
01:37:20,681 --> 01:37:23,514
Really! Women go their parent's
house after fighting and you...

1179
01:37:23,718 --> 01:37:25,982
Look, Inspector, this is a family
tradition.

1180
01:37:26,287 --> 01:37:28,983
We fight with our husbands and come
and stay in a hotel. - Yes, yes.

1181
01:37:29,190 --> 01:37:30,987
We don't give our parents a bad name
by living with them!

1182
01:37:31,192 --> 01:37:33,660
Who is this with you?
- Him?

1183
01:37:34,195 --> 01:37:35,992
He's my younger brother.
- Brother!

1184
01:37:36,363 --> 01:37:38,024
What happened, sister?
What happened, sister?

1185
01:37:38,199 --> 01:37:41,327
See what the Inspector is...
- Okay. So your brother is a Gujarati!

1186
01:37:41,535 --> 01:37:43,503
C'mon! Move!
- If the Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs...

1187
01:37:43,704 --> 01:37:45,604
and Christians can be brothers,
why can't a Gujarati be one?

1188
01:37:45,773 --> 01:37:47,604
What was he doing here with you?

1189
01:37:47,775 --> 01:37:49,675
He had come to cajole me
and take me home.

1190
01:37:50,044 --> 01:37:53,013
Yes! Come home, sister. Brother-in-law
must also be very worried!

1191
01:37:53,347 --> 01:37:56,510
Inspector, we were discussing
family planning...

1192
01:37:56,717 --> 01:37:59,185
I mean, family matters in the hotel
room. I swear by Reliance!

1193
01:38:00,221 --> 01:38:03,520
If your sister is married,
she must be having a husband too!

1194
01:38:04,058 --> 01:38:05,548
Where is he?

1195
01:38:06,393 --> 01:38:08,520
Sunday, at 11 o'clock at Judge Saxena's
residence, isn't it?

1196
01:38:09,396 --> 01:38:12,194
You want to meet my husband, isn't it?
That's all. Come along.

1197
01:38:12,566 --> 01:38:17,697
According to the holy calendar, the moon
is not in a favourable position...

1198
01:38:18,072 --> 01:38:20,040
for the next 2 days, sir.
These 4 days are very inauspicious.

1199
01:38:20,307 --> 01:38:21,740
Isn't there an auspicious
time before that?

1200
01:38:22,076 --> 01:38:24,203
So, you're really eager
to get married!

1201
01:38:46,534 --> 01:38:48,468
What is it, Inspector?
Who is she?

1202
01:38:48,636 --> 01:38:50,604
Sorry, Sir. We have arrested her
at the hotel raid.

1203
01:38:51,572 --> 01:38:54,336
She says that she's married and
that her husband is at your place.

1204
01:38:56,343 --> 01:39:00,677
Her husband! Your husband?
Who is he?

1205
01:39:08,055 --> 01:39:10,455
I've told them that...
- No, there's no need to say anything!

1206
01:39:11,659 --> 01:39:15,527
Darling, was that the only hotel
in the entire city to go to?

1207
01:39:16,063 --> 01:39:17,553
Look how you're dressed!

1208
01:39:17,731 --> 01:39:21,030
Uncle, I told you about the
World Trade Centre thing.

1209
01:39:24,338 --> 01:39:32,040
That's fine but staying in such a hotel...
- What do I say now?

1210
01:39:33,080 --> 01:39:35,048
What will you say? It's all his fault!

1211
01:39:35,449 --> 01:39:38,384
Whenever you were angry with her,
you stayed in a hotel, didn't you?

1212
01:39:39,186 --> 01:39:41,381
Yes.
- Then? Yes, I used to do that.

1213
01:39:41,755 --> 01:39:43,723
That's what is set her mind.

1214
01:39:44,425 --> 01:39:46,393
You came here without her
and she got angry.

1215
01:39:46,627 --> 01:39:49,061
How would she know about
the kind of hotel?

1216
01:39:52,666 --> 01:39:55,499
Who are you?
- Me?

1217
01:40:00,040 --> 01:40:02,338
I'm his brother-in-law.
She is my sister.

1218
01:40:03,444 --> 01:40:05,002
Hadn't I asked you to take care
of your sister?

1219
01:40:05,212 --> 01:40:07,180
Why did you let her get out of a house?
- Out of the house!

1220
01:40:07,381 --> 01:40:11,181
That's all! Inspector,
I'm sorry for the trouble.

1221
01:40:12,052 --> 01:40:14,520
Are you satisfied now?
- There's no need to say all this!

1222
01:40:15,055 --> 01:40:18,024
Just tell him that the next time I'm at
some hotel, he shouldn't arrest me!

1223
01:40:19,727 --> 01:40:23,527
This... how can I say this?
- No problem! I'll tell him.

1224
01:40:24,164 --> 01:40:28,032
Inspector, henceforth no matter when
and where you meet her, no arrests!

1225
01:40:31,605 --> 01:40:36,042
Come, my child. Sit down.
You've come at a very good time.

1226
01:40:37,444 --> 01:40:40,038
After 5 days,
your brother-in-law will be married.

1227
01:40:40,781 --> 01:40:43,375
Mr. Kishan... Bring her surely
to the wedding.

1228
01:40:43,751 --> 01:40:45,218
Yes.
- Promise!

1229
01:40:48,455 --> 01:40:50,548
I want just this kind of
a laptop for my Shekhar.

1230
01:40:50,824 --> 01:40:53,657
Excuse me, madam. Can I help you?
- What's the price of this laptop?

1231
01:40:54,028 --> 01:40:56,326
It's already sold, madam. It's being
billed right now. Someone else...

1232
01:40:56,563 --> 01:40:59,327
Okay. Give me another one like this.
- I'm sorry, we're out of stock.

1233
01:41:06,040 --> 01:41:09,999
Listen. You can buy this one.
I'll select another one.

1234
01:41:10,210 --> 01:41:13,338
No, it's really okay. Thank you.
- You must give the wedding present...

1235
01:41:13,714 --> 01:41:16,114
on the first night itself and not later.
Give it to her please.

1236
01:41:16,317 --> 01:41:18,342
That is so kind of you!
But there's a condition!

1237
01:41:18,519 --> 01:41:20,487
You will have to come for
a cup of coffee with me.

1238
01:41:21,388 --> 01:41:23,515
Think about it.
You may have to treat me to 2 cups.

1239
01:41:23,724 --> 01:41:26,659
I'm in the habit of talking a lot!
- It will be a lot of fun then...

1240
01:41:27,061 --> 01:41:29,689
because I have the same habit!
Shall we go?

1241
01:41:30,731 --> 01:41:32,699
Both have the same habit
as all women!

1242
01:41:38,806 --> 01:41:42,367
What? Really? Congratulations!
Congratulations!

1243
01:41:45,412 --> 01:41:48,540
Did you hear that? My aunt's son,
Balvinder, our 'Ballu'...

1244
01:41:49,249 --> 01:41:51,717
he's getting married on Sunday.
We've been called to the village.

1245
01:41:52,619 --> 01:41:54,985
You can go if you want to!
I'm not going to that house...

1246
01:41:55,322 --> 01:41:56,983
where people tried to get
you married to someone else!

1247
01:41:57,191 --> 01:41:59,318
One must forget old matters
at such times, Kaajal.

1248
01:41:59,693 --> 01:42:01,661
You will have to come with me.
- No! I won't go!

1249
01:42:02,262 --> 01:42:04,560
Stop being childish, Kaajal! Please!
- I said I don't want to go!

1250
01:42:05,532 --> 01:42:08,990
Kaajal, you...
- Stop! Stop! Do you want her to agree?

1251
01:42:09,536 --> 01:42:13,165
Fine... as you wish...
but I'll have to go.

1252
01:42:14,208 --> 01:42:17,177
Or else, Ballu won't sit on the horse!
He won't be able to get married!

1253
01:42:17,845 --> 01:42:21,008
Ballu, do one thing! Come along with me.
- Okay.

1254
01:42:21,215 --> 01:42:23,183
Or I'll get bored alone.
- Absolutely!

1255
01:42:26,553 --> 01:42:28,521
Are you feeling bad that I'm not going?

1256
01:42:30,224 --> 01:42:32,192
But you can understand my problem too,
isn't it?

1257
01:42:33,394 --> 01:42:35,521
Besides, my friend is getting
married here on Sunday.

1258
01:42:36,230 --> 01:42:38,528
I have to attend her wedding.
- Yes.

1259
01:42:45,606 --> 01:42:49,042
Which friend is getting married?
And that too, on Sunday!

1260
01:42:49,276 --> 01:42:51,210
It could be anyone.
Why are you scared?

1261
01:42:51,645 --> 01:42:53,476
I dread that on reaching my wedding,
dressed as a groom...

1262
01:42:53,680 --> 01:42:56,148
sister-in-law will welcome me
with the bride's friends!

1263
01:42:57,084 --> 01:42:59,484
What are you saying, pal?
Will you get me divorced...

1264
01:42:59,686 --> 01:43:01,517
on the day of your wedding?
- No!

1265
01:43:01,722 --> 01:43:04,486
Sanjana can't be that friend!
- Why?

1266
01:43:04,725 --> 01:43:08,161
Look, has Sanjana ever met Kaajal?
- No.

1267
01:43:08,562 --> 01:43:10,530
Has Kaajal ever met Sanjana?
- No.

1268
01:43:11,031 --> 01:43:12,999
Have I ever spoken about Sanjana
to your sister-in-law?

1269
01:43:13,133 --> 01:43:13,997
No.

1270
01:43:14,134 --> 01:43:15,999
Have you ever spoken to your
sister-in-law about Sanjana?

1271
01:43:16,170 --> 01:43:17,364
Where did you give me the
chance to do that?

1272
01:43:17,538 --> 01:43:19,529
So then? Be positive, pal!

1273
01:43:26,380 --> 01:43:34,344
Look... please take this. 20,000
rupees should be enough for 3 hours!

1274
01:43:35,389 --> 01:43:38,688
Give me more!
- Here you go. Please. Is it fine now?

1275
01:43:40,360 --> 01:43:43,193
This way, I can see both your office
and your home being sold!

1276
01:43:44,231 --> 01:43:47,029
It's your father-in-law who asked me
to bring this crazy woman along!

1277
01:43:47,401 --> 01:43:49,369
Your marriage would be in
trouble without her!

1278
01:43:50,070 --> 01:43:51,594
I will get married, won't I?

1279
01:43:51,772 --> 01:43:53,569
There's hardly any time left for
the auspicious moment!

1280
01:43:53,740 --> 01:43:55,970
All your problems will be solved.
Be positive!

1281
01:43:57,344 --> 01:44:01,974
May Mr. Gupta be praised!

1282
01:44:10,023 --> 01:44:10,990
Welcome!

1283
01:44:11,558 --> 01:44:14,322
Shekhar! This is my son-in-law.

1284
01:44:19,266 --> 01:44:22,997
You... you know him?
- Quite well!

1285
01:44:23,537 --> 01:44:25,004
Really! How?

1286
01:44:25,172 --> 01:44:27,003
Daddy... look, mummy is
calling you there.

1287
01:44:27,207 --> 01:44:29,004
Mummy! Oh, mummy!

1288
01:44:30,043 --> 01:44:32,170
Excuse me. I'll just be back. Take care.
- I'll just be back.

1289
01:44:32,412 --> 01:44:34,004
Hey, Photo!

1290
01:44:38,185 --> 01:44:39,174
Sit!

1291
01:44:42,055 --> 01:44:45,354
So, Photo...
What's with this second marriage?

1292
01:44:47,227 --> 01:44:49,024
It's a second marriage!

1293
01:44:49,229 --> 01:44:52,027
It's a second marriage!

1294
01:44:54,535 --> 01:44:55,968
Sir...
- Yes.

1295
01:44:56,303 --> 01:44:57,964
It's a second marriage.

1296
01:45:01,008 --> 01:45:05,968
Photo, did you leave your first wife?
Or did she elope with someone else?

1297
01:45:11,418 --> 01:45:13,386
Well... Both!
- Both?

1298
01:45:15,689 --> 01:45:18,157
Yes. She was eloping with someone;
I left her.

1299
01:45:20,127 --> 01:45:22,095
That's good.
She was an immoral girl!

1300
01:45:23,530 --> 01:45:28,991
The girl is immoral!

1301
01:45:32,172 --> 01:45:34,663
The girl is immoral!
- What's going on?

1302
01:45:42,115 --> 01:45:44,015
What is it?

1303
01:45:52,226 --> 01:45:53,625
I am coming.

1304
01:45:54,528 --> 01:45:58,294
That's amazing!
You're the first wife in this world...

1305
01:45:58,532 --> 01:46:01,467
who is attending her husband's
wedding and is happy as well!

1306
01:46:04,304 --> 01:46:05,965
It's my brother-in-law's wedding.
Mr. P.K.

1307
01:46:06,206 --> 01:46:07,468
Really?
- Yes.

1308
01:46:07,674 --> 01:46:09,642
When did Shekhar become
your brother-in-law?

1309
01:46:11,144 --> 01:46:12,975
Since the time he became my husband!

1310
01:46:19,019 --> 01:46:20,646
You're her husband!

1311
01:46:21,188 --> 01:46:23,156
You gave us the 'best couple'
award and forgot!

1312
01:46:24,024 --> 01:46:26,993
Tell me something...
- We'll talk later.

1313
01:46:27,227 --> 01:46:28,990
Have this sweet first.
Have a 'laddu' first.

1314
01:46:31,365 --> 01:46:33,993
Brother! That minister...
- Don't you worry!

1315
01:46:34,468 --> 01:46:36,993
Now he'll open his mouth only
to eat 'laddus'!

1316
01:46:37,537 --> 01:46:38,504
Look!

1317
01:46:40,207 --> 01:46:41,174
Scoot!

1318
01:46:44,111 --> 01:46:47,171
Why are you needlessly tensed?
Look at me? Am I tensed?

1319
01:46:48,215 --> 01:46:50,183
Your tension has arrived!
Look over there!

1320
01:46:53,720 --> 01:46:55,688
How come she's here?
What should we do now?

1321
01:46:56,156 --> 01:46:58,283
Are you tensed now?
- Don't be so smug!

1322
01:46:58,492 --> 01:47:00,460
I've just come along with the marriage
procession. But it's you who...

1323
01:47:00,661 --> 01:47:02,424
has to get married, isn't it?
- Yes... Run!

1324
01:47:07,534 --> 01:47:10,970
Sorry!
- You insolent man!

1325
01:47:26,186 --> 01:47:28,313
Do you know where Sanjana is?
- She's there.

1326
01:47:35,495 --> 01:47:37,360
What an insolent man that was!
Refused to relent.

1327
01:48:07,227 --> 01:48:09,024
Are you Kaajal?
- Yes.

1328
01:48:12,199 --> 01:48:15,032
Who is that playing this funeral
tune at a wedding?

1329
01:48:24,211 --> 01:48:26,042
Uncle, give me a cold drink.

1330
01:48:26,646 --> 01:48:31,049
Mummy! Look... uncle is not giving
me a cold drink! Mummy!

1331
01:48:34,087 --> 01:48:36,715
You! And why are you
dressed as a groom?

1332
01:48:42,462 --> 01:48:46,228
That's it! Even you feel that
it's my wedding, isn't it?

1333
01:48:47,834 --> 01:48:49,301
Even I feel that way!

1334
01:48:49,469 --> 01:48:51,437
Actually, sister-in-law,
it's my friend's wedding.

1335
01:48:51,805 --> 01:48:53,067
He buys two of everything.

1336
01:48:53,173 --> 01:48:56,006
Two shoes!
One for me and one for him!

1337
01:48:56,243 --> 01:48:59,007
Two watches!
One for me and one for him!

1338
01:48:59,379 --> 01:49:01,506
And this...
he's gone too far this time!

1339
01:49:01,715 --> 01:49:04,343
Two outfits!
One for me and one for him!

1340
01:49:04,718 --> 01:49:06,686
I hope he didn't buy
two 'mangalsutras'!

1341
01:49:08,054 --> 01:49:09,419
Sister-in-law, your sense of humour
is just great!

1342
01:49:09,589 --> 01:49:10,681
Just a minute!

1343
01:49:11,057 --> 01:49:13,025
You had gone to Poona
with Kishan, isn't it?

1344
01:49:15,061 --> 01:49:17,029
We came back!
- Why?

1345
01:49:19,533 --> 01:49:20,693
Because...

1346
01:49:25,172 --> 01:49:26,196
Brother!

1347
01:49:32,312 --> 01:49:34,109
Tell her why we came back from Poona.

1348
01:49:35,081 --> 01:49:37,379
Poona... Poona...
where did we go to Poona at all?

1349
01:49:38,084 --> 01:49:41,053
I could remember each and everything
you said on the train.

1350
01:49:42,088 --> 01:49:43,715
The way my aunt fought with you,

1351
01:49:44,090 --> 01:49:46,058
the way she made digs at
you all the time...

1352
01:49:46,226 --> 01:49:47,625
and the way she used to encourage
me to get married again!

1353
01:49:47,794 --> 01:49:50,228
That's it! I caught Sunny's hand
and got off the train!

1354
01:49:51,331 --> 01:49:53,231
It's good that we got off
at a station.

1355
01:49:53,500 --> 01:49:55,468
Or else, he would have
also gotten me...

1356
01:49:55,669 --> 01:49:57,398
Call the bride and
the groom, please.

1357
01:49:57,571 --> 01:49:59,334
Go, Sunny!
They're calling you!

1358
01:50:00,307 --> 01:50:02,172
What are you staring at me for?
Go to your friend!

1359
01:50:04,277 --> 01:50:05,505
His friend is really strange!

1360
01:50:05,712 --> 01:50:07,407
Neither will he sit on the dais
without him...

1361
01:50:07,581 --> 01:50:08,673
nor will he get married!

1362
01:50:09,049 --> 01:50:11,176
I wonder what will happen on
the nuptial night!

1363
01:50:11,384 --> 01:50:15,013
But it's his friend's wedding!
Why are you dressed like a relative?

1364
01:50:15,455 --> 01:50:19,016
Hey! That's right! Why am I carrying
this burden on my head?

1365
01:50:49,489 --> 01:50:51,548
Come on, Kaajal, let's go home.
- Wait till the wedding takes place.

1366
01:50:51,758 --> 01:50:53,419
How will the wedding take place
if you're around?

1367
01:50:53,593 --> 01:50:54,560
What?

1368
01:50:56,563 --> 01:50:58,531
I mean, will the wedding not take
place if you're not around?

1369
01:50:59,032 --> 01:51:01,000
Come on, let's go. Let's go home.
- I want to see the groom's face.

1370
01:51:03,336 --> 01:51:05,998
He's shyer than the bride!
You won't be able to see his face!

1371
01:51:11,177 --> 01:51:13,338
What happened now?
- You're not taking me seriously, Kaajal!

1372
01:51:13,580 --> 01:51:15,548
My condition is getting worse, Kaajal!
- Why have you kept your hand there?

1373
01:51:15,782 --> 01:51:18,182
Because I'm in pain, Kaajal!
- What! Should I call the doctor?

1374
01:51:18,418 --> 01:51:20,010
That will be of no use.
Let's go to the doctor instead!

1375
01:51:20,220 --> 01:51:22,017
Let's go.
- Yes.

1376
01:51:22,188 --> 01:51:24,019
Hey! It's nothing!
Watch the wedding! - What!

1377
01:51:24,190 --> 01:51:25,680
One must say that! A person's
wedding should not be ruined!

1378
01:51:26,059 --> 01:51:27,424
Let's go to the doctor.

1379
01:51:31,298 --> 01:51:32,356
Son-in-law!

1380
01:51:33,300 --> 01:51:34,597
Thats my wife!

1381
01:51:42,876 --> 01:51:45,538
You're very lucky.
You've just come in time.

1382
01:51:46,079 --> 01:51:47,706
Or it would have been too late!
- What?

1383
01:51:48,081 --> 01:51:50,049
Yes. I was just going to go home!

1384
01:51:52,385 --> 01:51:55,320
Get up! Everything is normal.
- Normal?

1385
01:51:55,689 --> 01:51:56,656
Yes.

1386
01:51:57,023 --> 01:51:59,321
Doctor, has my sugar level increased
by any chance?

1387
01:51:59,526 --> 01:52:01,994
No! Your sugar, salt and chilly,
everything is normal!

1388
01:52:02,395 --> 01:52:05,660
Did you run a grocery shop earlier?
- How did you know that?

1389
01:52:06,266 --> 01:52:08,996
It's been years since I shut
that business down.

1390
01:52:11,037 --> 01:52:12,504
Doctor, you do laugh a lot!

1391
01:52:12,706 --> 01:52:15,402
A doctor has told me that laughter
is very good for health!

1392
01:52:16,042 --> 01:52:18,510
Stop laughing and tell us
about his health!

1393
01:52:19,613 --> 01:52:21,672
He had a heart attack.
- But you just said that...

1394
01:52:22,048 --> 01:52:23,345
everything is normal.

1395
01:52:23,550 --> 01:52:28,010
I have to say that! If you tell the
heart patient about the first attack...

1396
01:52:28,221 --> 01:52:30,189
he may get the second attack!
- Oh my God!

1397
01:52:33,159 --> 01:52:36,026
What happened?
- I don't have pain...

1398
01:52:37,063 --> 01:52:38,360
in the chest, but here.

1399
01:52:38,565 --> 01:52:44,026
Oh! The kidney! Are you miserable?
Do you drink night and day?

1400
01:52:45,071 --> 01:52:49,531
I'm not a miserable drunkard!
I married the woman I fell in love with.

1401
01:52:50,410 --> 01:52:53,311
Good Lord! We were saved from
the fourth Devdas (movie).

1402
01:52:54,014 --> 01:52:55,982
But what you are suffering
from is worms...

1403
01:52:56,249 --> 01:53:00,151
I mean, it is a heart problem.
I'll prescribe a few medicines.

1404
01:53:01,021 --> 01:53:03,489
Good if you take them and better
if you don't.

1405
01:53:04,124 --> 01:53:05,989
To be honest, more than medicines,
what you need is...

1406
01:53:06,192 --> 01:53:07,989
Prayer, isn't it?

1407
01:53:09,195 --> 01:53:10,662
You need a holiday.

1408
01:53:13,033 --> 01:53:15,001
I'm giving you this card along
with the case paper.

1409
01:53:15,769 --> 01:53:17,999
This is the best hotel of Mauritius.

1410
01:53:18,338 --> 01:53:22,001
You'll get a discount of 25% if you
give my reference.

1411
01:53:24,577 --> 01:53:26,545
You're not a doctor!
You're a travel agent!

1412
01:53:26,713 --> 01:53:28,681
How did you find out?

1413
01:54:02,749 --> 01:54:04,182
Doctor! What are you doing here?

1414
01:54:04,350 --> 01:54:08,150
Doctor! Mr. Kishan?
The doctor is my brother.

1415
01:54:08,688 --> 01:54:10,986
He called me to inform me
that you'd be coming.

1416
01:54:11,691 --> 01:54:13,181
So, are you twin brothers?

1417
01:54:13,393 --> 01:54:15,486
What do I say? My father was a real...
Come along.

1418
01:54:16,362 --> 01:54:19,661
He's younger and I'm older.
But he thinks that he's older!

1419
01:54:20,266 --> 01:54:23,497
Now you tell me...
Is his dispensary bigger or this hotel?

1420
01:54:24,337 --> 01:54:27,670
Your hotel is bigger.
- So who is older? Me or him?

1421
01:54:28,141 --> 01:54:30,166
You're older.
- Absolutely right!

1422
01:54:31,177 --> 01:54:33,145
What did you say?
- Nothing.

1423
01:54:33,379 --> 01:54:36,007
Please take my luggage and
my wife to the room.

1424
01:54:39,586 --> 01:54:44,023
Hello, Sunny! How are you?
- Why have you called?

1425
01:54:44,724 --> 01:54:49,354
Hey! Why are you talking so rudely?
- The state you left me in...

1426
01:54:50,263 --> 01:54:52,697
I felt that I wasn't getting
married but fighting a war!

1427
01:54:53,299 --> 01:54:55,961
But your wedding did take place.

1428
01:54:56,669 --> 01:54:59,968
Did you see how I pretended to
have a heart attack?

1429
01:55:00,173 --> 01:55:03,631
Brother, don't you feel that you're
just lying these days?

1430
01:55:04,110 --> 01:55:07,978
Be positive, pal! It's said that
even if you lie a 100 times...

1431
01:55:08,181 --> 01:55:10,615
to help a wedding take place,
God forgives you!

1432
01:55:11,017 --> 01:55:12,678
He will forgive a 100 lies,
not a 1000!

1433
01:55:13,052 --> 01:55:16,988
To keep you free from worry,
I've come to Mauritius...

1434
01:55:17,323 --> 01:55:19,314
with your sister-in-law. And you!
- What? What did you say?

1435
01:55:19,692 --> 01:55:21,660
Where have you come?
- Mauritius! Why?

1436
01:55:22,162 --> 01:55:26,656
Welcome! I'm here as well!
- What! In which hotel are you?

1437
01:55:27,333 --> 01:55:30,996
I'll never tell you that! Or else,
here also, you will...

1438
01:55:39,813 --> 01:55:45,012
Hey, Sunny! In the whole wide world,
did you have to come to this hotel...

1439
01:55:45,218 --> 01:55:47,015
and this city for your honeymoon?

1440
01:55:48,054 --> 01:55:51,512
Did you inform me that... you were
coming to this city and this hotel?

1441
01:55:53,059 --> 01:55:55,960
Look, Sunny, before our wives
see each other...

1442
01:55:56,996 --> 01:55:58,964
take Sanjana away from here.
Please!

1443
01:56:00,466 --> 01:56:02,434
I can say the same dialogue to you,
can't I?

1444
01:56:03,336 --> 01:56:07,966
Hey! Kaajal thinks that I'm
a heart patient. I can't move around!

1445
01:56:08,174 --> 01:56:10,142
What will I tell her about
the shifting?

1446
01:56:11,211 --> 01:56:13,475
As if I won't have to explain
anything to Sanjana!

1447
01:56:14,080 --> 01:56:17,982
Look, brother! This is your second
honeymoon but the first one for me!

1448
01:56:18,351 --> 01:56:20,478
Have some mercy on me!
- Don't scream!

1449
01:56:21,020 --> 01:56:22,317
My cottage is right here!

1450
01:56:22,488 --> 01:56:23,978
Your sister-in-law will come out!
- That one?

1451
01:56:24,190 --> 01:56:26,488
Yes!
- Very good! This one's mine!

1452
01:56:29,195 --> 01:56:30,321
Run, brother!

1453
01:56:31,364 --> 01:56:32,331
Brother!

1454
01:56:35,335 --> 01:56:38,668
You're here! What a surprise!

1455
01:56:40,039 --> 01:56:41,666
Has sister-in-law come along as well?

1456
01:56:42,041 --> 01:56:45,010
Well... she wasn't
feeling too well. So...

1457
01:56:45,245 --> 01:56:46,507
So, I left her home.

1458
01:56:46,713 --> 01:56:50,342
Sir, I've taken your luggage and
your wife to the room.

1459
01:56:57,490 --> 01:57:00,288
Brother, why did you lie that you
haven't got sister-in-law along?

1460
01:57:00,994 --> 01:57:03,292
Sanjana...
- Because he's ashamed, Sanjana.

1461
01:57:04,364 --> 01:57:07,333
You do know that sister-in-law
isn't mentally sound.

1462
01:57:08,635 --> 01:57:11,968
So that means I was alone in the
room with a mad woman!

1463
01:57:12,572 --> 01:57:17,976
I can understand your problem.
Look at where she is!

1464
01:57:23,549 --> 01:57:24,982
How did she come here, Sunny?

1465
01:57:28,788 --> 01:57:30,653
Is that your wife, sir?

1466
01:57:31,357 --> 01:57:33,655
You just took her to the room and
forgot about it so soon!

1467
01:57:34,027 --> 01:57:36,996
No, but the one I left in the room...
- Shut up! You're arguing with me!

1468
01:57:37,463 --> 01:57:39,988
But, Sir, the one I left in the room...
- Come on... Scoot! Go on!

1469
01:57:41,434 --> 01:57:42,594
He's a strange, forgetful man!

1470
01:57:42,835 --> 01:57:45,326
Listen... Who are you?
- What do you mean?

1471
01:57:45,605 --> 01:57:48,506
Who are both of you?
- She's my wife. I swear by Reliance!

1472
01:57:48,708 --> 01:57:50,676
And I'm her husband! Why?
- So, who is that man...

1473
01:57:51,044 --> 01:57:53,672
who's calling himself her husband?
- Who?

1474
01:57:54,580 --> 01:57:56,013
That man!

1475
01:58:01,487 --> 01:58:04,012
So, the couple is here too!
How are you, Sanjana?

1476
01:58:07,260 --> 01:58:10,024
So you've come for your honeymoon
with my darling brother-in-law?

1477
01:58:11,164 --> 01:58:13,029
You've got your brother
along here too!

1478
01:58:15,802 --> 01:58:19,533
Why did you have to follow us?
- You had asked me...

1479
01:58:19,739 --> 01:58:21,707
to take care of sister, isn't it?
- That was in India.

1480
01:58:23,076 --> 01:58:25,544
I can take care of her myself here!

1481
01:58:29,082 --> 01:58:31,050
So you're back.
- Let's go, Sanjana.

1482
01:58:31,417 --> 01:58:33,385
Where?
- To the room!

1483
01:58:36,155 --> 01:58:38,055
Why are you standing here? Scoot!

1484
01:58:39,759 --> 01:58:44,719
Hey, Bobby! You're here too.
Where are you running off too?

1485
01:58:45,631 --> 01:58:47,565
Well...
- Where is Sunny?

1486
01:58:47,834 --> 01:58:49,802
What happened? Why did you bring
me to the room so fast?

1487
01:58:51,771 --> 01:58:53,671
Kiss me!
- No! Not now!

1488
01:58:54,040 --> 01:58:56,008
Who is he?
- I'm her brother.

1489
01:58:57,176 --> 01:58:59,508
So, you're her brother!

1490
01:59:01,047 --> 01:59:03,174
Hey, Kaajal!
- You want to kill my Sunny!

1491
01:59:03,516 --> 01:59:07,008
You think you're a great don!
I'll kill you before you can...

1492
01:59:08,221 --> 01:59:11,520
Kaajal! He's not her brother.
He is one of her brother's men...

1493
01:59:12,392 --> 01:59:14,690
who has become her bodyguard
to protect her from him!

1494
01:59:15,795 --> 01:59:17,353
Go, take Bobby away.

1495
01:59:26,572 --> 01:59:27,539
Sunny!

1496
01:59:30,376 --> 01:59:32,037
Get up!

1497
01:59:32,612 --> 01:59:34,375
Stand up straight!

1498
01:59:35,081 --> 01:59:36,708
What were you doing in that room?

1499
01:59:39,285 --> 01:59:43,051
Sister-in-law, I... I went looking
for her to that room by mistake.

1500
01:59:43,589 --> 01:59:46,057
And I've been looking for you
since so long! You are really...

1501
01:59:47,093 --> 01:59:49,061
Why do both of you get out of
each other's sight?

1502
01:59:49,228 --> 01:59:51,719
You've come for your honeymoon.
Enjoy yourselves together!

1503
01:59:52,298 --> 01:59:54,664
That's what I always keep telling
him but he doesn't listen to me!

1504
01:59:55,201 --> 01:59:56,998
So, will you enjoy with him?

1505
01:59:57,370 --> 01:59:58,997
Well... he's my husband!

1506
01:59:59,338 --> 02:00:02,330
Brother-in-law!
- Where are your glasses?

1507
02:00:03,543 --> 02:00:05,340
How many times have I told you
to wear your glasses!

1508
02:00:05,545 --> 02:00:07,513
Your brother-in-law is there! That one!
- Me!

1509
02:00:07,713 --> 02:00:09,681
What's happening here?
I'm really confused!

1510
02:00:10,583 --> 02:00:13,017
Let's go to our rooms. Let's freshen up
and meet again in the evening.

1511
02:00:13,319 --> 02:00:15,344
That's right. Let's freshen up.
- But where should I go?

1512
02:00:15,655 --> 02:00:18,351
With your brother-in-law! Where else?
- Let's go. Let's go, Kaajal.

1513
02:00:24,597 --> 02:00:27,031
Who is whose husband and who
is whose wife...

1514
02:00:28,067 --> 02:00:30,035
I must find that out!

1515
02:01:01,033 --> 02:01:04,332
"A heart is always crazy!"

1516
02:01:04,570 --> 02:01:07,505
"It defies all logic!"

1517
02:01:07,707 --> 02:01:11,006
"How can it be blamed
if it behaves waywardly..."

1518
02:01:11,377 --> 02:01:14,676
"in such a charming company?"

1519
02:01:26,292 --> 02:01:29,352
"A heart is always crazy!"

1520
02:01:29,762 --> 02:01:32,697
"It defies all logic!"

1521
02:01:33,299 --> 02:01:36,029
"How can it be blamed if it
behaves waywardly..."

1522
02:01:36,602 --> 02:01:39,537
"in such a charming company?"

1523
02:02:18,611 --> 02:02:21,512
"It beats relentlessly at nights
defying all efforts..."

1524
02:02:22,281 --> 02:02:24,511
"it remains under no control."

1525
02:02:25,651 --> 02:02:29,018
"Careful lest it might break."

1526
02:02:29,589 --> 02:02:31,682
"It's very fragile."

1527
02:02:32,658 --> 02:02:36,025
"It caves under no pressure..."

1528
02:02:36,362 --> 02:02:39,525
"All efforts fail..."

1529
02:02:40,233 --> 02:02:42,793
"to separate it from another
heart it loves!"

1530
02:02:43,869 --> 02:02:47,032
"We are together..."

1531
02:02:47,440 --> 02:02:49,032
"immersed in love."

1532
02:02:49,475 --> 02:02:53,969
"Why won't it not inebriate us?"

1533
02:02:54,280 --> 02:02:57,443
"That too with such a
companion around?"

1534
02:03:41,694 --> 02:03:45,027
"The language and the
tale of love..."

1535
02:03:45,231 --> 02:03:47,529
"need no expression for the
heart to understand."

1536
02:03:48,801 --> 02:03:52,032
"A heart responds to another
heart intuitively."

1537
02:03:52,405 --> 02:03:54,965
"Let love flow freely."

1538
02:03:55,675 --> 02:04:01,978
"Let the hearts unite
without any fear."

1539
02:04:03,282 --> 02:04:06,308
"Don't put them under any guard!"

1540
02:04:07,019 --> 02:04:09,988
"All it takes is a moment..."

1541
02:04:10,356 --> 02:04:11,983
"for the hearts to meet
and blossom."

1542
02:04:12,191 --> 02:04:16,992
"And the trance of love
engulfs a person..."

1543
02:04:17,263 --> 02:04:20,323
"in such a captivating company."

1544
02:04:25,037 --> 02:04:28,006
"A heart is always crazy!"

1545
02:04:28,507 --> 02:04:31,499
"It defies all logic!"

1546
02:04:31,744 --> 02:04:35,009
"How can it be blamed if it
behaves waywardly..."

1547
02:04:35,414 --> 02:04:38,008
"in such a charming company?"

1548
02:05:02,475 --> 02:05:04,443
Minister, what are you doing here
in South Africa?

1549
02:05:05,010 --> 02:05:06,978
Hi Prem. How are you?
- I'm fine.

1550
02:05:07,179 --> 02:05:10,478
Are you here on a vacation?
- No, I have settled down here.

1551
02:05:11,016 --> 02:05:13,985
Settled...? Your business
was doing fine in India.

1552
02:05:14,453 --> 02:05:17,320
There were heavy showers in Mumbai
on the 26th of July.

1553
02:05:21,560 --> 02:05:25,326
I thought the rains were romantic, so
I fixed a programme in my guest house.

1554
02:05:26,031 --> 02:05:28,499
I had no idea the rains would turn
into a nightmare.

1555
02:05:29,034 --> 02:05:32,993
The water ran neck high, people
reached home after two days.

1556
02:05:33,339 --> 02:05:35,330
I was also stuck out there with her
for two days.

1557
02:05:36,475 --> 02:05:39,000
The media worked overnight,
they found me out.

1558
02:05:39,412 --> 02:05:41,380
And I was watching myself on tv.

1559
02:05:41,614 --> 02:05:45,015
The pictures were damn sleazy...
bad, very bad.

1560
02:05:46,218 --> 02:05:48,186
I cleared the mess up
in the morning.

1561
02:05:49,188 --> 02:05:51,520
And wife?
- Said, I don't deserve to be in India.

1562
02:05:51,791 --> 02:05:54,624
And she dragged me here.
- Nice.

1563
02:05:54,994 --> 02:05:56,962
At least India is rid
of a self-styled leader.

1564
02:06:07,406 --> 02:06:10,136
You are one damn step ahead of me.
How do you it?

1565
02:06:12,478 --> 02:06:14,309
I don't understand.

1566
02:06:15,014 --> 02:06:16,982
How do you woo girls? Teach me.

1567
02:06:17,683 --> 02:06:20,982
You were thrown out of India
because of women.

1568
02:06:21,220 --> 02:06:23,188
D'you want to be thrown
out of here too?

1569
02:06:24,056 --> 02:06:27,321
You have a pretty good wife.
Why do you flip about?

1570
02:06:29,395 --> 02:06:31,363
Have you seen my wife?
- Yes

1571
02:06:32,031 --> 02:06:34,499
Beautiful, well-mannered, strong
and reliable...

1572
02:06:35,334 --> 02:06:38,167
she's a real gem. And you... gosh!

1573
02:06:39,371 --> 02:06:41,339
You are raving

1574
02:06:44,043 --> 02:06:46,011
That woman can't see me happy

1575
02:06:47,146 --> 02:06:49,512
Everytime I fall in love,
she grieves.

1576
02:06:51,584 --> 02:06:55,452
If I give dictations to my secretary,
she feels bad. This is not fair.

1577
02:06:57,790 --> 02:06:59,951
Forget India, you don't deserve
to live in this world.

1578
02:07:00,359 --> 02:07:03,294
I'll kill you and rather be a widow.
- Go ahead.

1579
02:07:04,129 --> 02:07:05,619
Greetings.
- Bless you.

1580
02:07:05,998 --> 02:07:07,590
Get up!

1581
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:09,968
Get up!
- My glasses...

1582
02:07:11,103 --> 02:07:13,298
What do you think you were watching?

1583
02:07:15,541 --> 02:07:21,309
Get back here... you can't sleep
at nights if you sight me, eh?

1584
02:07:21,747 --> 02:07:23,647
To hell with your love!
Move it!

1585
02:07:30,356 --> 02:07:32,984
You always make up your mind
at the last moment, Kishan.

1586
02:07:34,460 --> 02:07:37,657
Four hours!
- Several famous actors too.

1587
02:07:38,030 --> 02:07:40,590
Four hours are not a big deal.
Why did you stop? Move ahead.

1588
02:07:47,039 --> 02:07:49,007
Whom has she come along with?

1589
02:07:49,208 --> 02:07:51,176
It doesn't matter whom she has
come with? Come on...

1590
02:07:51,377 --> 02:07:53,004
You consider Sunny as your
younger brother...

1591
02:07:53,212 --> 02:07:55,009
and you aren't bothered to
know with whom his wife is?

1592
02:07:55,214 --> 02:07:58,183
I mean, the movie is about
to start...

1593
02:07:58,484 --> 02:08:01,715
I remember... she calls him a brother.

1594
02:08:06,191 --> 02:08:07,624
What is going on here?
- Kaajal...

1595
02:08:07,793 --> 02:08:11,354
Come on, we'll tell Sunny about it
then it's up to Sunny and her.

1596
02:08:11,597 --> 02:08:13,224
Let's go from here.

1597
02:08:20,205 --> 02:08:21,502
What is going on here?

1598
02:08:23,509 --> 02:08:27,036
Tell him to stay away from my friend.
- Kaajal... Kaajal...

1599
02:08:27,880 --> 02:08:29,040
Kaajal, you?

1600
02:08:29,248 --> 02:08:30,545
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

1601
02:08:30,749 --> 02:08:32,717
You've just been married
and have come...

1602
02:08:33,085 --> 02:08:35,053
back from a honeymoon.
What are you doing?

1603
02:08:35,220 --> 02:08:36,312
What have I done?

1604
02:08:36,488 --> 02:08:38,388
You've come for a movie with
another man...

1605
02:08:38,557 --> 02:08:40,422
and you dare to ask me what
you have done?"

1606
02:08:41,260 --> 02:08:43,228
The guy is indeed handsome and
smart but that doesn't...

1607
02:08:43,429 --> 02:08:45,397
mean you will deceive your husband.
- Just listen...

1608
02:08:45,564 --> 02:08:47,395
And you... you've got wandering
eyes, right?

1609
02:08:47,633 --> 02:08:50,727
Go upstairs, and see what your
wife is doing?

1610
02:08:51,503 --> 02:08:53,061
Your wife?

1611
02:08:53,138 --> 02:08:54,162
Kaajal, let's go.
The movie will start anytime.

1612
02:08:54,373 --> 02:08:56,000
Movie can wait but I'll teach
him such a lesson today...

1613
02:08:56,175 --> 02:08:57,472
which will make him forget
his maths.

1614
02:08:57,576 --> 02:09:00,010
Don't do it, Kaajal. In school,
he used to fail in maths.

1615
02:09:00,412 --> 02:09:02,710
He has not only failed in maths
but also in his life.

1616
02:09:04,783 --> 02:09:07,251
Just because I am quiet it doesn't
mean that I won't say anything.

1617
02:09:07,419 --> 02:09:08,579
What will you say?

1618
02:09:08,787 --> 02:09:11,017
That... rather you should
be ashamed and not me.

1619
02:09:11,290 --> 02:09:14,521
Why are you with him if you
claim to be upright? - With him?

1620
02:09:14,727 --> 02:09:18,026
He wife might be crazy but he's
still a rich man...

1621
02:09:18,230 --> 02:09:19,663
and so you've come with him,
haven't you?

1622
02:09:20,065 --> 02:09:21,362
What... what is she saying?

1623
02:09:21,533 --> 02:09:23,364
We will sort it out amicably
after seeing the movie.

1624
02:09:23,535 --> 02:09:24,524
Let's go or else we'll
miss the movie.

1625
02:09:24,737 --> 02:09:27,365
She's calling me crazy and you
want to see a movie?

1626
02:09:27,573 --> 02:09:30,201
Am I crazy? Am I?
- How can you be crazy, Kaajal?

1627
02:09:30,409 --> 02:09:32,536
Then whom is she calling crazy?
- His wife...

1628
02:09:33,078 --> 02:09:35,046
Hey, I am his wife.

1629
02:09:35,280 --> 02:09:37,180
If you are his wife then
who is she?

1630
02:09:40,085 --> 02:09:42,053
She's Bobby, his wife...

1631
02:09:42,287 --> 02:09:44,050
Not his wife but his...

1632
02:09:44,256 --> 02:09:46,224
What? She's your wife?

1633
02:09:46,425 --> 02:09:47,585
No she's his wife.
- What?

1634
02:09:47,760 --> 02:09:49,557
Is Bobby your wife?
- No, she's his wife.

1635
02:09:49,795 --> 02:09:51,558
Whose wife is she?
- His...

1636
02:09:52,164 --> 02:09:54,325
Tell us, whose wife Bobby is?
- His...

1637
02:09:54,500 --> 02:09:55,990
She's my wife...
- What?

1638
02:09:56,168 --> 02:09:57,999
I means ours...
- Both of us...

1639
02:10:00,039 --> 02:10:03,008
You lied to me...
- Kaajal, please...

1640
02:10:03,208 --> 02:10:08,009
Listen to me...
- Kaajal, please...

1641
02:10:18,657 --> 02:10:21,023
You have been sleeping in the
office for the past two days.

1642
02:10:21,226 --> 02:10:23,023
I have a very good solution for
all your worries.

1643
02:10:23,228 --> 02:10:24,354
I have a weapon for you, sir!

1644
02:10:24,530 --> 02:10:26,361
Weapon?
- I mean an idea, sir!

1645
02:10:26,532 --> 02:10:28,363
Do you belong to a blacksmith family...

1646
02:10:28,567 --> 02:10:30,034
that you are calling an
idea a weapon?

1647
02:10:30,269 --> 02:10:33,534
Sir, you are a wayward fellow,
a thorough womanizer.

1648
02:10:34,073 --> 02:10:35,700
You are not as you seem to be.

1649
02:10:36,075 --> 02:10:38,043
Hey, mind your language.
- And you are no less.

1650
02:10:39,411 --> 02:10:41,311
Sister on the face with
Bobby in arms!

1651
02:10:42,281 --> 02:10:43,373
Hey, what did you say just now?

1652
02:10:43,582 --> 02:10:46,176
You have to say this to
each other's wife.

1653
02:10:46,752 --> 02:10:48,219
Your have prove yourself
as the villain

1654
02:10:48,387 --> 02:10:50,287
while proving the other
guy to be a hero.

1655
02:10:50,456 --> 02:10:54,051
That will purge all your sins.

1656
02:10:58,731 --> 02:11:00,528
I am your slave, sir!

1657
02:11:00,699 --> 02:11:02,997
You can return the idea
if you don't like it.

1658
02:11:03,435 --> 02:11:05,665
But it really hurts when
somebody bashes me.

1659
02:11:06,171 --> 02:11:09,004
Why didn't you give such a
positive idea before?

1660
02:11:09,308 --> 02:11:11,333
We've been tensed about it
for the past two days?

1661
02:11:11,543 --> 02:11:13,340
Thank you very much.

1662
02:11:18,550 --> 02:11:20,177
C'mon Ritu, get ready soon.

1663
02:11:20,452 --> 02:11:22,352
Greetings, uncle!
- Greetings, dear!

1664
02:11:22,588 --> 02:11:25,022
Where's Sanjana, uncle?
- She's gone to meet you.

1665
02:11:25,457 --> 02:11:27,288
She's at my house?
But why?

1666
02:11:28,360 --> 02:11:31,352
To apologise. She'd offended
you yesterday...

1667
02:11:31,530 --> 02:11:34,363
Kaajal, you will miss each other
if you go to your house now.

1668
02:11:34,633 --> 02:11:36,464
Why don't you wait here?

1669
02:11:36,635 --> 02:11:38,193
She will come here moment now.

1670
02:11:38,403 --> 02:11:43,363
Kaajal dear, we've to go somewhere.
Please don't mind. Is anybody there?

1671
02:11:44,076 --> 02:11:46,544
No Lakshmi, I don't want tea or coffee
You can get back to your work.

1672
02:11:55,687 --> 02:11:56,984
Sanjana...

1673
02:12:02,027 --> 02:12:03,324
Hey, is nobody home?

1674
02:12:07,132 --> 02:12:08,997
Oh, you are here...

1675
02:12:09,301 --> 02:12:11,166
It's good that you are alone.

1676
02:12:14,106 --> 02:12:17,507
Sanjana, I need to talk to you.

1677
02:12:17,810 --> 02:12:19,573
You are angry with, brother,
aren't you?

1678
02:12:19,745 --> 02:12:21,542
But it's my fault.

1679
02:12:21,713 --> 02:12:23,544
I am the real culprit.

1680
02:12:23,715 --> 02:12:29,017
Brother is no lesser to a saint.
God has stopped creating such good men.

1681
02:12:30,088 --> 02:12:32,352
My only hobby is: Girls...

1682
02:12:34,459 --> 02:12:39,692
It's an art to hook up a girl
and I am an expert in it.

1683
02:12:40,599 --> 02:12:43,363
It's not difficult to hook them up.

1684
02:12:43,569 --> 02:12:45,537
Yes. If the girl seems
difficult to please...

1685
02:12:46,071 --> 02:12:48,369
then act to be in love with another
and try to commit suicide.

1686
02:12:48,807 --> 02:12:52,038
Then that girl will come to your
rescue and then its fun.

1687
02:12:52,845 --> 02:12:55,370
But Sanjana was different.

1688
02:12:56,481 --> 02:12:58,449
Whenever, I moved closer to her.

1689
02:12:59,051 --> 02:13:00,985
She'd ask me to wait till marriage.

1690
02:13:01,753 --> 02:13:03,653
And so I had to make her my wife.

1691
02:13:07,025 --> 02:13:08,652
My wife has a headache...

1692
02:13:09,027 --> 02:13:11,325
She keeps cribbing for all 24 hours.

1693
02:13:11,730 --> 02:13:13,664
How can a sane man live with her?

1694
02:13:14,132 --> 02:13:17,329
I've never understood
how can a man live...

1695
02:13:17,703 --> 02:13:19,398
with one woman for his
entire life?

1696
02:13:19,571 --> 02:13:21,539
There are some who do
just as your Sunny.

1697
02:13:22,040 --> 02:13:24,008
But I cannot live like that.
It's true.

1698
02:13:24,176 --> 02:13:26,508
Lies... she keeps insisting
upon not lying.

1699
02:13:27,512 --> 02:13:29,673
Does she understand what a lie is?

1700
02:13:30,215 --> 02:13:32,012
I must have lied to her many times.

1701
02:13:33,252 --> 02:13:35,345
The first lie is that I don't lie...

1702
02:13:36,054 --> 02:13:39,023
And the second one that I don't
love anyone else other than her.

1703
02:13:41,326 --> 02:13:45,524
But the truth is I love Bobby!

1704
02:13:46,064 --> 02:13:48,692
That's why I have kept Bobby
in another house.

1705
02:13:49,501 --> 02:13:53,335
Where I can visit frequently
to have a nice time.

1706
02:13:54,539 --> 02:13:59,533
For the past couple of days we
have been living as husband and wife.

1707
02:14:15,360 --> 02:14:17,328
One last weapon is left, sir!

1708
02:14:18,130 --> 02:14:21,497
I used it and it had the
right effect.

1709
02:14:22,234 --> 02:14:24,065
Which weapon?
- Divorce.

1710
02:14:27,406 --> 02:14:30,637
Sir, listen to my whole idea.
I want to save your marital life.

1711
02:14:32,711 --> 02:14:36,340
I had a fight with my wife and
she threatened to walk out...

1712
02:14:36,615 --> 02:14:40,176
I asked her to leave only
after a divorce.

1713
02:14:41,053 --> 02:14:45,012
Ever since, my wife has forgotten...

1714
02:14:45,290 --> 02:14:49,693
even to mention her parental home.

1715
02:14:54,166 --> 02:14:55,633
Sir, can I take a seat?

1716
02:15:01,540 --> 02:15:06,978
We men have only one weapon
against our wives.

1717
02:15:07,679 --> 02:15:09,647
Sir, these letters
have come for you.

1718
02:15:12,718 --> 02:15:14,310
This one is yours.

1719
02:15:24,229 --> 02:15:25,594
What happened, sir?

1720
02:15:26,698 --> 02:15:28,495
What is it, sir?

1721
02:15:30,502 --> 02:15:34,495
Had you given this idea to our
wives before telling us?

1722
02:15:35,507 --> 02:15:37,475
They have sent us a divorce notice.

1723
02:15:38,377 --> 02:15:40,345
Now what are we going to do?

1724
02:15:40,579 --> 02:15:42,479
Only God can help you.

1725
02:15:56,128 --> 02:15:57,959
Control yourself, Sunny!

1726
02:15:58,130 --> 02:16:00,098
Be positive...
why are you laughing?

1727
02:16:02,434 --> 02:16:04,629
The colour of my envelope is
red and yours is yellow.

1728
02:16:05,504 --> 02:16:07,472
Here we are about to lose our
lives and you are...

1729
02:16:07,672 --> 02:16:09,367
thinking of the envelope's colour?

1730
02:16:09,541 --> 02:16:11,509
Think of something... think...

1731
02:16:12,344 --> 02:16:13,641
That's what I am doing...

1732
02:16:14,012 --> 02:16:17,311
Wonder what Prem must be doing after
having put us in this condition.

1733
02:16:25,690 --> 02:16:27,658
Hello.
- Hello Prem, it's me Kishan!

1734
02:16:28,193 --> 02:16:30,661
Kishan, yeah tell me.

1735
02:16:31,696 --> 02:16:33,994
Didn't I tell you, he hasn't
gone for any business trip?

1736
02:16:34,533 --> 02:16:37,661
He's having a time of his life
with girls around him.

1737
02:16:38,036 --> 02:16:40,004
At this time of the night?
- It's daytime there.

1738
02:16:41,406 --> 02:16:44,000
Prem, a catastrophe has struck us.

1739
02:16:45,577 --> 02:16:48,341
It's very bad but there's
no such news here.

1740
02:16:49,047 --> 02:16:52,175
Because of you, I...
- Not I but us...

1741
02:16:52,517 --> 02:16:54,280
we are in deep trouble.

1742
02:16:54,453 --> 02:16:56,353
My life...
- Our lives...

1743
02:16:56,555 --> 02:16:58,955
Yes, our lives have been
destroyed by our wives.

1744
02:16:59,391 --> 02:17:02,292
What do you mean by us?
Who else got ruined along with you?

1745
02:17:04,529 --> 02:17:06,292
Mine...

1746
02:17:07,265 --> 02:17:08,960
Sekhar's!
You are married too?

1747
02:17:09,167 --> 02:17:10,964
Yes and now I am going to
get divorced too.

1748
02:17:11,169 --> 02:17:12,136
Divorce?

1749
02:17:12,704 --> 02:17:14,296
Don't be so surprised.

1750
02:17:14,506 --> 02:17:15,973
The girl that you'd sent
to my guest house...

1751
02:17:16,174 --> 02:17:17,971
has set our houses on fire.

1752
02:17:19,177 --> 02:17:21,304
She was a bombshell,
not a small cracker.

1753
02:17:21,813 --> 02:17:25,977
Shame on you! Two men
can't hide an affair!

1754
02:17:26,451 --> 02:17:30,615
An editor and a crime reporter!
What makes your newspaper sell?

1755
02:17:31,156 --> 02:17:32,987
Chuck the newspaper first...

1756
02:17:33,358 --> 02:17:35,326
Hey, what are you doing?
Talk to him nicely.

1757
02:17:35,494 --> 02:17:36,984
Okay then, you speak to him...

1758
02:17:37,195 --> 02:17:39,322
The matter has turned
very serious here.

1759
02:17:39,698 --> 02:17:41,666
Please do something or else my
life will also be ruined...

1760
02:17:42,033 --> 02:17:44,001
along with your friend.
- Friend?

1761
02:17:44,703 --> 02:17:46,000
One who cannot do
one simple thing?

1762
02:17:46,204 --> 02:17:48,001
One who cannot even
lie to his wife?

1763
02:17:48,206 --> 02:17:51,175
Couldn't handle Bobby...
how can he ruin your life?

1764
02:17:51,776 --> 02:17:55,337
He cannot be my friend.
- Prem, stop giving a speech.

1765
02:17:55,580 --> 02:17:58,014
Come here and solve our
problem or else...

1766
02:17:58,583 --> 02:18:00,346
Or else...
- Or else, what?

1767
02:18:01,386 --> 02:18:03,013
Or else...

1768
02:18:04,523 --> 02:18:06,354
Our lives will be ruined...

1769
02:18:07,626 --> 02:18:12,029
I know that you have solutions
to every problem.

1770
02:18:13,064 --> 02:18:16,192
Please come back soon.
We are alone here.

1771
02:18:17,068 --> 02:18:20,367
Hey, don't cry... I am coming back.

1772
02:18:23,575 --> 02:18:26,043
You should be ashamed of yourselves.
You doubt your...

1773
02:18:26,411 --> 02:18:28,538
saintly husbands and that
too for Bobby.

1774
02:18:29,080 --> 02:18:31,708
She's my wife and their
sister-in-law.

1775
02:18:32,584 --> 02:18:35,052
Prem, why are you taking the blame
to save your friends?

1776
02:18:36,821 --> 02:18:38,789
Kaajal, I am not taking
anyone's blame...

1777
02:18:39,257 --> 02:18:44,058
I swear by my friends,
I am not lying.

1778
02:18:44,296 --> 02:18:46,560
And if I am lying then they
will die within one week.

1779
02:18:48,099 --> 02:18:49,066
What?

1780
02:18:50,268 --> 02:18:51,735
You still don't believe me?

1781
02:18:53,705 --> 02:18:57,334
I think, I'll have to give them
the geographical details of my life.

1782
02:18:58,410 --> 02:19:00,378
Bobby and I loved each
other since childhood.

1783
02:19:01,079 --> 02:19:04,571
But my and her fathers
were sworn enemies.

1784
02:19:06,718 --> 02:19:09,016
And so Bobby and I got
married secretly.

1785
02:19:11,056 --> 02:19:13,024
On the next day of our wedding...

1786
02:19:13,291 --> 02:19:15,191
my father went to Barista
for coffee.

1787
02:19:16,061 --> 02:19:20,725
He met Pooja there, happened to like
her and then she became my wife.

1788
02:19:24,069 --> 02:19:25,559
Take it in whichever way...

1789
02:19:25,737 --> 02:19:27,705
but I couldn't break
my father's heart.

1790
02:19:28,607 --> 02:19:30,541
He was a heart patient.

1791
02:19:31,243 --> 02:19:34,041
His situation was so critical
that he would...

1792
02:19:34,212 --> 02:19:36,043
clasp his heart while
talking to me.

1793
02:19:36,414 --> 02:19:39,542
And I was in a constant fear
that he'd die any moment.

1794
02:19:40,452 --> 02:19:42,249
And I'd have to carry his
burden on my shoulder.

1795
02:19:43,088 --> 02:19:45,056
We just steal a couple of
singles while he...

1796
02:19:45,490 --> 02:19:47,390
talks only in boundaries.

1797
02:19:48,226 --> 02:19:51,718
We will lose our match if he
loses his wicket.

1798
02:19:52,597 --> 02:19:54,497
My father was very happy
with our wedding.

1799
02:19:55,567 --> 02:19:58,502
He was so happy with our
wedding that he...

1800
02:20:00,038 --> 02:20:03,997
died of heart attack
two days later.

1801
02:20:06,678 --> 02:20:08,407
And left me with two wives.

1802
02:20:11,583 --> 02:20:13,244
I remember him all the time.

1803
02:20:15,820 --> 02:20:18,345
Let's not discuss such
depressing topics.

1804
02:20:24,529 --> 02:20:26,360
Let's come to the point.

1805
02:20:29,601 --> 02:20:33,037
While going abroad I asked you
to look after Pooja...

1806
02:20:34,572 --> 02:20:37,166
leaving poor Bobby alone.

1807
02:20:38,143 --> 02:20:40,543
And so I asked my friends to
take care of her...

1808
02:20:41,146 --> 02:20:44,206
when I am not in town.

1809
02:20:44,616 --> 02:20:46,208
That's what they did.

1810
02:20:46,418 --> 02:20:49,387
But what was the need
for you to lie?

1811
02:20:52,090 --> 02:20:53,648
But they couldn't also speak
the truth.

1812
02:20:54,025 --> 02:20:55,993
After all Pooja is your friend.

1813
02:20:57,028 --> 02:20:58,996
You could've squealed to Pooja.

1814
02:21:00,098 --> 02:21:01,998
You would have told her that
Bobby is my wife.

1815
02:21:02,534 --> 02:21:04,001
Then who am I?

1816
02:21:18,116 --> 02:21:21,017
The guys are trapped,
I'm helping them out.

1817
02:21:21,720 --> 02:21:24,018
I'm not involved.
There's this girl...

1818
02:21:25,056 --> 02:21:27,354
Prem, what are you whispering
in her ears?

1819
02:21:28,059 --> 02:21:29,219
Hang on.

1820
02:21:29,427 --> 02:21:31,258
Why are you gesturing?
Say what you want to?

1821
02:21:32,063 --> 02:21:34,691
Just wait for a couple of
minutes, please!

1822
02:21:35,066 --> 02:21:37,091
No Prem, whatever you have
to say... say it aloud.

1823
02:21:37,302 --> 02:21:38,360
Then listen...

1824
02:21:40,538 --> 02:21:43,701
Pooja, they called me up in
South Africa saying that...

1825
02:21:44,075 --> 02:21:46,043
their secret has been revealed
asking me to rush back.

1826
02:21:46,211 --> 02:21:48,042
That their wives have come to
know of their affairs.

1827
02:21:48,747 --> 02:21:50,374
I came here for the sake of
their friendship.

1828
02:21:50,548 --> 02:21:52,539
You are our friend but that doesn't
mean you will say anything.

1829
02:21:52,717 --> 02:21:55,481
Our friendship is limited to
this birth but my...

1830
02:21:55,687 --> 02:21:57,655
relationship with my wife
spans over many births.

1831
02:21:58,156 --> 02:22:02,388
This calculation makes no sense that
I'll leave my wife for a friend.

1832
02:22:02,627 --> 02:22:04,561
You are actually responsible
to ruin his life.

1833
02:22:04,763 --> 02:22:07,163
I am a witness of your attempts
to set him up with Bobby.

1834
02:22:07,699 --> 02:22:09,564
And he got me trapped in return.
He's the witness.

1835
02:22:09,734 --> 02:22:11,497
Pooja, these two...
- Enough...

1836
02:22:13,037 --> 02:22:19,340
Just tell me, have I ever
enquired about your whereabouts?

1837
02:22:20,578 --> 02:22:24,674
Have I ever questioned you for
your late nights?

1838
02:22:25,717 --> 02:22:28,083
Have I ever asked you
for any explanation?

1839
02:22:30,288 --> 02:22:36,693
Not only that, whenever you were
not at home I'd answer...

1840
02:22:38,062 --> 02:22:40,030
all the unwanted phone calls and
take all the messages.

1841
02:22:40,198 --> 02:22:42,029
I used to trust you so much.

1842
02:22:43,535 --> 02:22:47,369
But today, you've lost that trust.
You've lost your Pooja forever.

1843
02:22:48,406 --> 02:22:50,033
Pooja, these three friends
are alike.

1844
02:22:51,876 --> 02:22:54,970
Hey listen,
I don't know about them...

1845
02:22:55,480 --> 02:22:57,971
but I am not at all like them.

1846
02:22:58,383 --> 02:23:00,544
Prove yourself innocent in the court.

1847
02:23:02,187 --> 02:23:03,313
C'mon, Pooja!

1848
02:23:03,521 --> 02:23:05,318
Pooja won't go anywhere.

1849
02:23:06,691 --> 02:23:10,320
Listen to me, you can go to badminton
court tennis or any other court.

1850
02:23:10,829 --> 02:23:14,321
But don't go to that court.
Pooja... Pooja...

1851
02:23:16,501 --> 02:23:18,492
She is not even responding.
- We've got the answer, Prem.

1852
02:23:19,237 --> 02:23:21,330
My answer carries a notice
along while yours does not.

1853
02:23:44,762 --> 02:23:47,356
I don't understand, what the problem
with your friends is.

1854
02:23:48,066 --> 02:23:51,035
It all depends on time.
When the time isn't right...

1855
02:23:51,302 --> 02:23:53,031
even good intentions go wrong.

1856
02:23:53,505 --> 02:23:54,972
So, what do you want me to do?

1857
02:23:55,106 --> 02:23:57,973
I just want you to tell their
wives that they'd got...

1858
02:23:58,376 --> 02:24:00,344
stuck in this situation
because of me.

1859
02:24:00,512 --> 02:24:02,639
That they have not done
anything to you.

1860
02:24:08,553 --> 02:24:10,316
What will happen to you then?

1861
02:24:11,022 --> 02:24:14,321
Bobby, my wife, isn't a suspicious
and short tempered person...

1862
02:24:15,026 --> 02:24:16,994
like Kaajal and Sanjana.

1863
02:24:17,395 --> 02:24:19,989
She's very innocent and lovable.

1864
02:24:20,832 --> 02:24:22,993
She's angry and upset now but
I'll make her understand.

1865
02:24:25,036 --> 02:24:28,494
You're still looking at them.
- Everyone's dancing, why aren't they?

1866
02:24:29,374 --> 02:24:31,501
Madam, don't you like this song?

1867
02:24:34,112 --> 02:24:35,170
Pooja...

1868
02:24:40,752 --> 02:24:42,686
I told you my time isn't right now.
- I am the one going through...

1869
02:24:43,054 --> 02:24:45,682
a bad phase. What about my money?
- Money... Money...

1870
02:24:46,224 --> 02:24:49,022
I am about to lose my wife and
you are thinking about money.

1871
02:24:49,227 --> 02:24:51,195
Isn't there anything important
in your life other than the money?

1872
02:24:56,801 --> 02:24:58,462
Give me a drink.

1873
02:24:58,670 --> 02:25:01,298
Mr. Prem, Bobby's husband is
in coma for the past two years.

1874
02:25:02,240 --> 02:25:05,971
She had to pay 20 thousand per
day just to keep him Rahul.

1875
02:25:06,678 --> 02:25:08,646
What will be more important
for her than money?

1876
02:25:21,492 --> 02:25:24,984
Sorry, I shouldn't have
asked for money.

1877
02:25:29,233 --> 02:25:30,996
Why are you looking at me like this?

1878
02:25:31,569 --> 02:25:35,130
It's so difficult to keep
a happy facade.

1879
02:25:43,281 --> 02:25:47,012
From now on the responsibility
of your husband's treatment is mine.

1880
02:25:56,327 --> 02:25:59,296
There's only one solution to
get out of the mess...

1881
02:26:00,531 --> 02:26:02,624
You are saying it now, after we've
fallen in this mess.

1882
02:26:03,167 --> 02:26:07,126
We will apologize to our wives.

1883
02:26:09,140 --> 02:26:11,973
We tried our best but did they accept
our explanation? No!

1884
02:26:12,710 --> 02:26:15,474
They won't ever believe that we are
innocent, right Sunny?

1885
02:26:16,547 --> 02:26:18,640
Apologising to them will make
them realise...

1886
02:26:19,217 --> 02:26:20,309
that we regret our deeds.

1887
02:26:20,485 --> 02:26:22,453
We are ashamed and so we are
telling them the truth.

1888
02:26:24,188 --> 02:26:25,985
Just because they consider all our
truth as fibbing...

1889
02:26:26,424 --> 02:26:28,654
will they consider our lies as truth?
- We will make them believe us.

1890
02:26:29,193 --> 02:26:31,161
Everything will be alright.
Be positive!

1891
02:26:32,430 --> 02:26:36,332
Brother, you keep saying, be positive.
What is it?

1892
02:26:37,368 --> 02:26:39,131
It's my blood group.

1893
02:26:46,044 --> 02:26:49,343
Please forgive us.
- What are you doing?

1894
02:26:49,580 --> 02:26:51,013
We were stupid, ungracious...

1895
02:26:51,215 --> 02:26:53,945
We were ungrateful...
- We'd lost our way.

1896
02:26:54,419 --> 02:26:56,387
What could we do,
we'd lost our minds.

1897
02:26:56,688 --> 02:26:59,282
I promise, I won't
ever go to a club.

1898
02:26:59,524 --> 02:27:01,287
As this mess started from there.

1899
02:27:01,492 --> 02:27:03,460
I'd gone to the club to
end up in this mess...

1900
02:27:04,262 --> 02:27:05,957
What am I saying?

1901
02:27:06,431 --> 02:27:09,457
Sir... sir...

1902
02:27:11,002 --> 02:27:13,300
Prem sir has gone to the Suicide
Point to commit suicide.

1903
02:27:13,504 --> 02:27:14,471
What?

1904
02:27:20,545 --> 02:27:23,981
Why isn't Pooja here as yet? Have they
told her I'm here to kill myself?

1905
02:27:32,724 --> 02:27:34,316
Look, there he is, Prem...

1906
02:27:35,693 --> 02:27:37,661
Prem!
- Brother Prem...

1907
02:27:40,031 --> 02:27:41,999
She's here.
Suicide mission starts.

1908
02:27:43,568 --> 02:27:46,503
I am going for an atonement
of my sins.

1909
02:27:46,704 --> 02:27:49,673
No, brother, stop... there's
a dangerous ravine ahead.

1910
02:27:50,141 --> 02:27:54,475
Now, neither can anyone stop me nor
can anyone save me from it.

1911
02:27:56,314 --> 02:27:57,406
Son, this seems to be very deep.

1912
02:27:57,582 --> 02:27:59,345
You are going to turn into a
mince meat, once in it.

1913
02:27:59,517 --> 02:28:01,508
Take one step behind.
- Hey, what are you doing? Run fast.

1914
02:28:02,053 --> 02:28:04,021
What can I do? Should
I wear the horse's shoe?

1915
02:28:04,222 --> 02:28:05,348
I am running as fast as I can.

1916
02:28:05,523 --> 02:28:08,424
Someone at least inform me
about my wife.

1917
02:28:09,293 --> 02:28:11,352
Why can't you run faster?
- Then, how should I run?

1918
02:28:11,562 --> 02:28:14,360
Just as you used to run behind
me to hit me.

1919
02:28:14,766 --> 02:28:17,030
Brother Prem, I am coming...

1920
02:28:19,570 --> 02:28:21,367
I think I should turn around and see.

1921
02:28:23,341 --> 02:28:25,536
Prem...
- What has happened to you now?

1922
02:28:25,710 --> 02:28:28,372
Prem...
- Slowly.

1923
02:28:28,713 --> 02:28:32,046
Prem...
- Sunny, this a very dangerous slope...

1924
02:28:32,583 --> 02:28:33,550
slowly...

1925
02:28:33,818 --> 02:28:37,049
Prem...
- Reduce your speed.

1926
02:28:37,588 --> 02:28:39,055
Prem, I can't.

1927
02:28:40,825 --> 02:28:43,055
Sunny, wait...
- Hold me...

1928
02:29:06,784 --> 02:29:08,513
Oh, my cap... father!

1929
02:29:09,487 --> 02:29:12,012
Why had you come here?
- To save you.

1930
02:29:12,456 --> 02:29:15,016
You are Sunny and not a film hero.

1931
02:29:15,259 --> 02:29:18,023
If you weren't going to commit suicide
then why did you come here?

1932
02:29:18,262 --> 02:29:20,230
If a dog is chasing a car,
it doesn't mean he wants...

1933
02:29:20,565 --> 02:29:23,363
to own or drive the car.

1934
02:29:24,368 --> 02:29:27,360
I had come here to scare my wife.
Now, I am scared.

1935
02:29:27,572 --> 02:29:29,540
Kishan...

1936
02:29:30,074 --> 02:29:32,042
Why are you calling Kishan,
is he Lord Kishan that...

1937
02:29:32,210 --> 02:29:34,041
he will come and save us.

1938
02:29:35,246 --> 02:29:37,214
All of you wait here while
I will go and check it out.

1939
02:29:37,448 --> 02:29:39,609
Hurry up.

1940
02:29:41,085 --> 02:29:44,543
Sunny, Prem...
- Kishan...

1941
02:29:45,590 --> 02:29:47,057
Where are you both?

1942
02:29:47,258 --> 02:29:49,624
Come down, you'll be able to see us.
Come down...

1943
02:29:50,494 --> 02:29:52,394
Coming.

1944
02:29:56,133 --> 02:29:58,499
Prem? You? Here?
- Yes.

1945
02:29:59,036 --> 02:30:03,370
Where's Sunny?
- Your friend is hanging on to my leg.

1946
02:30:03,808 --> 02:30:08,006
Yes brother, I am here,
hanging on Prem's leg.

1947
02:30:08,346 --> 02:30:10,337
Then keep hanging.
Did you come here...

1948
02:30:10,548 --> 02:30:12,175
to save him or kill him?

1949
02:30:12,350 --> 02:30:16,514
Didn't I say he will spoil everything
with his unsteady demeanour...

1950
02:30:16,721 --> 02:30:20,020
why did you bring him here?
- Sunny, you are such a duffer...

1951
02:30:20,625 --> 02:30:22,525
Shut up! First get us out of here.

1952
02:30:22,760 --> 02:30:24,091
Then you can reprimand me.

1953
02:30:24,295 --> 02:30:27,025
Don't stand there talking to us.
Go and find some rope.

1954
02:30:28,065 --> 02:30:29,089
I'll search for it...

1955
02:30:29,267 --> 02:30:31,030
Get a rope...
- Rope...

1956
02:30:38,442 --> 02:30:40,410
There might be one in the car,
I'll go and get it.

1957
02:30:41,712 --> 02:30:44,112
Prem, I got one.
Here, catch it.

1958
02:30:46,083 --> 02:30:47,550
Catch it...

1959
02:30:48,386 --> 02:30:50,377
C'mon, catch it...

1960
02:30:50,821 --> 02:30:53,153
Prem, why are you dancing
like Aishwarya Rai?

1961
02:30:53,391 --> 02:30:54,688
Be still...

1962
02:30:55,159 --> 02:30:56,649
I am still, but I can't seem
to catch the rope...

1963
02:30:57,028 --> 02:30:58,552
Kishan has thrown towards me.

1964
02:31:02,533 --> 02:31:05,001
Brother Kishan, throw it
down further.

1965
02:31:05,269 --> 02:31:06,566
Okay, one minute...

1966
02:31:07,838 --> 02:31:09,669
Here take this...
- Be careful...

1967
02:31:10,374 --> 02:31:12,706
Kaajal, be quiet! Can't you
see what I am doing?

1968
02:31:13,210 --> 02:31:15,337
Kishan, a little bit further.

1969
02:31:16,380 --> 02:31:18,507
Here take this...

1970
02:31:19,050 --> 02:31:22,019
Kishan, be careful...
- Hey, shut up, don't disturb me.

1971
02:31:23,554 --> 02:31:27,012
Kishan, little more.

1972
02:31:27,224 --> 02:31:31,024
Is it? Here you are!
- Kishan, be careful!

1973
02:31:31,796 --> 02:31:34,196
Don't worry about me.
Nothing has happened to me.

1974
02:31:35,199 --> 02:31:37,360
Don't worry.
I'll bring them up.

1975
02:31:38,569 --> 02:31:40,537
Kishan, further down.

1976
02:31:40,705 --> 02:31:42,263
Further down?

1977
02:31:58,122 --> 02:32:01,649
Asking me to move further down,
look here is where you have brought us.

1978
02:32:02,193 --> 02:32:05,993
Had it been in his control,
he will pack us up.

1979
02:32:08,132 --> 02:32:10,157
What are you doing sunny?
- You fool.

1980
02:32:11,736 --> 02:32:14,000
You are cutting the branch that
you are hanging on to.

1981
02:32:14,538 --> 02:32:16,005
Should I kick you off?

1982
02:32:19,043 --> 02:32:21,511
Sorry, brother Prem...

1983
02:32:25,549 --> 02:32:27,517
Kishan, I feel giddy
when I look down.

1984
02:32:27,752 --> 02:32:29,686
Then don't look down.

1985
02:32:30,221 --> 02:32:31,415
Close your eyes.

1986
02:32:31,622 --> 02:32:34,523
That is going to anyhow
happen in sometime.

1987
02:32:34,859 --> 02:32:37,350
Kishan, be positive,
think positive.

1988
02:32:43,734 --> 02:32:45,429
What happened, Prem?

1989
02:32:46,070 --> 02:32:49,528
"How to keep my heart in control?"

1990
02:32:49,807 --> 02:32:55,973
"In such a precarious situation."

1991
02:32:58,516 --> 02:33:01,974
He's a strange man, he can sing
in this situation too?

1992
02:33:03,521 --> 02:33:04,988
Go away...

1993
02:33:06,524 --> 02:33:08,151
Have you gone crazy?

1994
02:33:16,033 --> 02:33:17,660
Go away...
- Did something pass by?

1995
02:33:18,035 --> 02:33:19,502
Why were you singing a song?

1996
02:33:21,705 --> 02:33:26,005
I wanted to sing... I like singing
when I am hanging on a cliff.

1997
02:33:26,777 --> 02:33:29,610
Do something, Pooja, Kaajal...

1998
02:33:32,216 --> 02:33:34,013
Why are you tying the rope to the rock?
Throw it here first.

1999
02:33:34,218 --> 02:33:36,516
If I don't tie it to the rock then
we too will off from the cliff.

2000
02:33:36,787 --> 02:33:38,345
Please do it, soon...

2001
02:33:40,724 --> 02:33:42,521
Throw it fast.

2002
02:33:45,329 --> 02:33:46,353
Snake...

2003
02:33:50,801 --> 02:33:53,031
Prem, calm down...

2004
02:33:53,337 --> 02:33:55,305
I think it's a water snake,
not the poisonous one...

2005
02:33:55,473 --> 02:33:56,497
Nothing will happen if it bites.

2006
02:33:56,674 --> 02:33:58,039
Are you sure?
- Even I am not sure.

2007
02:33:58,209 --> 02:34:00,439
Catch the rope and come up...

2008
02:34:03,681 --> 02:34:06,980
Hey, it's a rope...
- If it is a rope then catch it.

2009
02:34:07,585 --> 02:34:10,486
No I won't catch it...
- Why not?

2010
02:34:10,754 --> 02:34:14,986
If I hold on to the rope then Pooja
will think I was just acting.

2011
02:34:15,292 --> 02:34:18,159
Then we are really going to die.

2012
02:34:18,395 --> 02:34:22,491
Kishan, hold on to the rope.
- Please tell her, both of you.

2013
02:34:23,400 --> 02:34:25,994
Pooja, forgive brother Prem...

2014
02:34:26,237 --> 02:34:28,000
Pooja, accept his apology or
else Kishan and Sunny...

2015
02:34:28,172 --> 02:34:30,003
are going to die unnecessarily.

2016
02:34:30,141 --> 02:34:32,006
Forgive him, Pooja!
Please forgive him.

2017
02:34:32,276 --> 02:34:36,007
Prem, come up!
I am no longer angry with you.

2018
02:34:36,580 --> 02:34:41,176
I've forgiven you.
- Alright Pooja, I am coming up.

2019
02:34:41,552 --> 02:34:44,521
Pooja, you are great,
for having forgiven me.

2020
02:34:47,057 --> 02:34:48,752
Hey, be careful...

2021
02:34:49,393 --> 02:34:51,020
Pull them up.

2022
02:34:52,796 --> 02:34:54,354
I am coming up, Pooja.
I am coming...

2023
02:34:54,532 --> 02:34:56,295
Sanjana, I am coming...

2024
02:34:57,368 --> 02:34:59,632
Kaajal, I am bringing your
husband along.

2025
02:35:00,337 --> 02:35:01,634
I am coming...

2026
02:35:02,740 --> 02:35:04,640
You both, catch on to
the rope too...

2027
02:35:08,746 --> 02:35:11,977
Hadn't it been a question of
saving these two, I would have...

2028
02:35:12,149 --> 02:35:14,982
rather used this rope as a noose.

2029
02:35:15,519 --> 02:35:17,316
Pooja, you are great.

2030
02:35:18,155 --> 02:35:20,316
If I'd been in your place
I wouldn't...

2031
02:35:20,524 --> 02:35:22,321
have forgiven you either.

2032
02:35:22,726 --> 02:35:25,320
So from now on, I will follow
whatever you wish me to do.

2033
02:35:25,763 --> 02:35:27,390
I'll listen to everything.

2034
02:35:28,098 --> 02:35:29,998
Really?
- Yes.

2035
02:35:30,534 --> 02:35:32,161
Promise.

2036
02:35:32,536 --> 02:35:35,994
Then you'll have to be my husband
in every birth.

2037
02:35:46,550 --> 02:35:48,347
I love you very much, Prem.

2038
02:35:50,054 --> 02:35:52,022
I have faith in God...

2039
02:35:53,157 --> 02:35:56,456
I know that you will surely
change your habits.

2040
02:35:58,796 --> 02:36:04,962
Which means you already knew that
I was straying?

2041
02:36:11,709 --> 02:36:16,476
Pooja, your husband Prem has
changed from today.

2042
02:36:19,016 --> 02:36:20,984
I take an oath on you.

2043
02:36:24,488 --> 02:36:30,984
I promise to be the best
husband ever.

2044
02:36:35,699 --> 02:36:36,996
I am sorry.
- Prem.

2045
02:36:50,848 --> 02:36:52,008
C'mon...

2046
02:37:02,593 --> 02:37:03,617
What?

2047
02:37:21,345 --> 02:37:23,973
Aren't you ashamed of anything
after what we have gone through?

2048
02:37:57,047 --> 02:38:00,016
Listen, want a bite?

2049
02:38:00,317 --> 02:38:02,376
No, I don't want anything.
I am dieting.

2050
02:38:04,054 --> 02:38:06,522
Did you see that none of them
really turned back to see her.

2051
02:38:12,062 --> 02:38:13,529
You've really changed.

2052
02:38:18,802 --> 02:38:26,208
"My happiness is with you..."

2053
02:38:29,246 --> 02:38:32,044
"My beloved..."
