1
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,440
'Father!'

2
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:36,440
'Father! Father!'

3
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:41,360
'Tell me a story.
- It's late. Get to sleep.'

4
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:44,560
'Please, father! Tell one story.
- Tomorrow. Go to sleep.'

5
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,759
'Yesterday
you said the same thing.'

6
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,759
'Tell me now, please.'

7
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,720
'Father! Father!
Father! Please! Tell me.'

8
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,880
'Father's sleeping. So,
you get some sleep as well.'

9
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:02,720
'Father! Father! Please!'

10
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,160
'Go and watch cartoons
on TV.'

11
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,000
'No need to see TV.
Father will tell you a story..'

12
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:15,040
'Father! Tell me a story.
- Okay.'

13
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,760
'There was a once a king.'

14
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,040
'That king had a queen
and a daughter.'

15
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,960
'I'm bored of hearing'

16
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,240
'it again and again.'

17
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,600
'Father!
Tell me some other story.'

18
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,920
'Father! Tell me a new story.
Father! Tell me a new story.'

19
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,200
'Why are you buzzing
like fly inside the ear?'

20
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,880
'Fly? Wait.
I'll tell you a new story.'

21
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:43,400
'Long ago,
there lived a fly in a city.'

22
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,880
'Fly? Tell me, tell me.'

23
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:50,160
'In the city,
there also lived a bad boy.'

24
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:54,040
'Bad boy? What was his name?
- Sudeep.'

25
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,120
Pull.

26
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,840
What is this? The
Board meeting is on

27
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,720
and you..
- Boring, man.

28
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,920
Even after trying so much
that officer is not agreeing.

29
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,480
Shall we kill him?

30
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,400
What is the need
for violence always?

31
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:46,480
As if we have never done it.

32
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,720
Pull.

33
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,440
Two weeks is all we have.

34
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,200
We have to go there and
get it done immediately.

35
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,800
Pull.

36
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,120
We have 2 weeks.

37
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,680
Pull..

38
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,840
You want any help?

39
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,360
Pull. Fire.

40
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,400
Thanks!

41
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,840
Do you come every day?
- Yes.

42
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,440
What time?
- Your time.

43
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,159
Thanks.

44
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:39,040
What are you trying now?
- See for yourself.

45
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,200
It is good. What is this?
- What is good?

46
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,600
I'm trying to attach
two beams to this heart.

47
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,880
But there is no satisfaction.

48
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,800
Instead of this try to unite
me and your brother.

49
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,480
Then you'll get satisfaction.

50
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,480
I'm here and
he is suffering in Dubai.

51
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,960
Go to sleep soon.
It is getting late.

52
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:14,120
Sister-in-law! The power
has gone only for 4-5 houses.

53
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,040
Phone the electricity Board
people. - Okay.

54
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,680
Only those who pay on time
they'll cut the current.

55
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,120
Hey! What's up?

56
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:59,400
Aye! What is this?
Why did you pour that down?

57
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:03,280
Have you lost your mind, Jani?
What are you doing? Wait.

58
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,040
What are you doing?

59
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,600
I'm going on asking you.
What are you doing?

60
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,040
Hey.. What's happening man?

61
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,400
Are you mad?

62
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:39,760
"A girl in that house."

63
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:48,040
"Slowly, covertly, a girl came
in that house." - What's this?

64
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,720
"Though she knows everything."

65
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,680
"But she doesn't say anything."

66
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:06,440
"But she will someday." Come on.
- It's okay.

67
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,040
Bindu!
- Yes.

68
00:08:14,159 --> 00:08:18,159
Go to sleep. It is getting late.
- Okay, sister-in-law!

69
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:33,240
"She never utters a word, but
I can understand her feelings.."

70
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:38,120
Jani.. How can you smile? Since
2 years you're crazy about her.

71
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:42,078
You are roaming behind her like
mad. Did she respond even once?

72
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:45,120
Did she even say thanks to you?
Curtain closed.

73
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,040
She did that because she is
concerned about me. - What?

74
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,560
Yes. If she had
left the curtain open

75
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,079
till morning,
I'd stand here.

76
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:56,160
That she knows.
Breeze, mist and cold.

77
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:59,240
If I fall ill,
she won't be able to bear it.

78
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:03,800
That's why she closed the window
though she didn't want to.

79
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,640
Hi. How are you?
- Fine. Cheers!

80
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,320
How are you?

81
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,760
Hi, Sudeep!
- Hi!

82
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,520
Happy 10th anniversary
of your concern.

83
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,640
Thanks! Please! Take him inside.
- Okay, sir! Please! Come.

84
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,600
Lot of guests. - I'll be there
for sure. Is 2 pm okay with you?

85
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,840
Rascal? He said he won't sign
but he has come to the party.

86
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,600
Welcome, sir!
Thanks for coming.

87
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,040
Happy Anniversary!
- Thank you!

88
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:43,600
A small gift on this occasion.
- Thank you!

89
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,160
It is completely approved.
- Thank you! Thank you, sir!

90
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,480
Without you the party
would've felt incomplete.

91
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,000
By the way my wife has
also come. Shashi Kala!

92
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,120
Meet, Mr. Sudeep!
- Hello!

93
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,120
Hello!

94
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,920
You've a nice collection
of guns. - Thank you!

95
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,640
My wife is also very fond
of shooting. - Really?

96
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:22,760
You should teach her sometime.
- Darling! He must be very busy.

97
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:25,080
We shouldn't trouble him.

98
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:28,240
No, ma'am! Not at all.
It'll be my pleasure.

99
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,680
Will you take them inside?
- Sure.

100
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:34,840
"My name is Sheela.
Sheila's youth."

101
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,520
Come with me.

102
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,960
Two large.
How was it possible?

103
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,240
We could not persuade him
and were breaking our heads.

104
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:49,040
You got his wife..
You connected with her?

105
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,360
Isn't there any girl in this
world who won't fall for you?

106
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,280
There was.

107
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,400
My wife.

108
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:02,760
At first sight I wanted her.

109
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:07,880
Then I noticed her wealth.

110
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,160
I married her.

111
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:16,320
I asked for wealth. She said she
will die but won't part with it.

112
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:27,520
Apart from that, I can
get any dame in this world.

113
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,520
Any.

114
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:33,400
In Poyampalli govt. school,
the benches have been supplied.

115
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,840
In Pathabasti govt. school we
have sent books for 50 people.

116
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,800
In Balnagar govt.
school black boards.

117
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,480
English text books
for fourth grade.

118
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,080
This has to be given
this week.

119
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,720
Their exams are nearing.
- Karthikeyan!

120
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:49,440
How much balance is there
in the bank? - Rs 15,600.

121
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,520
That is overdrawn.

122
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:55,200
Shut up. Okay.

123
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:58,800
Sindhu! Didn't Agarwal Sweets
say that he'll give cheque?

124
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,920
Their cheque amount is way
lesser than our conveyance.

125
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,840
And, so I have come.

126
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,480
Like always this month too
to get rid of your problem.

127
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,200
This money was earned
with hardship by me.

128
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:18,080
A cheque of Rs 15.

129
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,600
Thank you!
- By the way

130
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,920
no one should
know about my donation.

131
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:26,560
I don't like this publicity.
- Is it humbleness? - It's true.

132
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,640
That is why I have not
signed my cheque too.

133
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,240
If you don't sign, the
cheque won't get passed.

134
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:37,160
Excuse me! By the way, then
as a donor I'm asking this.

135
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,520
How was my last month's
fund used?

136
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,680
For your Rs. 15 do you
expect a bank balance sheet?

137
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,240
She is unnecessarily
interfering.

138
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,080
Don't let your hair loose.
Tie it up.

139
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,120
You'll look very nice.
- I like it loose.

140
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:55,160
You are loose. But tie
your hair up. - Stupid.

141
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,760
Thank you!
You continue.

142
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:02,280
Last month for books and
slates we spent Rs 90,000.

143
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:07,640
For getting more details
I need to search. I'll try.

144
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,240
Excuse me.

145
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,800
You look beautiful.

146
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:19,680
"The language of love
isn't that difficult.."

147
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:26,200
Even if you don't smile,
you look beautiful.

148
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:31,480
Bunty says
he'll come in the evening.

149
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:35,200
"It's such a simple..
- Hi. - Hi.

150
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,920
Hi, Bindu. - Sister-in-law.
What brings you here?

151
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,720
I came to tell
an important matter.

152
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,520
Sudeep constructions are
giving a big amount as charity.

153
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,360
You go and meet their MD.
- How to meet him?

154
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,120
Don't worry.
- Excuse me, sir!

155
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,240
Yes. - To meet
you from project five eleven..

156
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,720
Arrange meeting with investors.

157
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:53,320
And make sure you have top
class presentation, and..

158
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,560
Sir is in an important meeting.
Excuse me! Sir!

159
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,520
Sir?
- Send that girl inside.

160
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,080
Let's meet later.

161
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,400
Get out.

162
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:28,320
"Lava, there's lava
in my heart."

163
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,520
My name is Bindu.
I run a charity organization.

164
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:37,800
"Your beauty enthralls me."

165
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:45,640
"It's making me restless."

166
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:51,600
If you give some donation,
it'll be useful for children.

167
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:02,560
"Lava, there's lava
in my heart."

168
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,520
Oh, my god! Rs 15,00,000?
- Thank you, sir!

169
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,400
I have given donation,
so can I join too. - Sir!

170
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,960
I liked your thought.

171
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,640
Wish to work closely with you.

172
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:20,080
I can't believe it, sir! It is
our pleasure. - Thanks a lot.

173
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:24,920
Sir! Please take this.
A small token of gratitude.

174
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:29,200
What is this?
- Micro art. I made it myself.

175
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,920
Nice.

176
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,720
'Om Shivaya Namaha!'

177
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:39,200
'Om Karhikeyaya Namaha!
Om Parvati Namaha!'

178
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,760
Bindu!
You seem to be very happy.

179
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:45,400
I have got a big cheque
for our Project Five Eleven.

180
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,400
Swami! Do prayer.
- Okay.

181
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,920
Did you see? She has come
to pray keeping my cheque.

182
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,720
Prayer for Rs 15? The prayer
ticket itself costs Rs. 20.

183
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:58,440
Yes. Isn't it superb?

184
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,640
15 Lakhs?

185
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,720
Who gave you? - Director
of Sudeep constructions.

186
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:09,280
He has given 15 only once.
I give 15 every month.

187
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,600
Lord!

188
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:15,120
God's blessings are always
with those with good intentions.

189
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:18,080
Take the offering.
Distribute it to all.

190
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,160
First change
that idiotic expression.

191
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,240
She gave sacrament to everyone
other than you. Even to me.

192
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,480
After giving all of you
she didn't give me

193
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:04,159
that means I'm so special.
Think.

194
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,760
Move.
- Aye!

195
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:22,159
What is he saying?
- He is saying thanks.

196
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,839
See you.

197
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:42,680
You are doing so much for kids.
I must do something for you.

198
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,080
Sir..
- Lunch?

199
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,840
It's been long since I spent
time like this with a friend.

200
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,040
Thanks!

201
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,200
If you don't mind,
can I place the order?

202
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,120
Yeah. - Come here.
- Sir.

203
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:24,200
Jani! Next where?
- It is there.

204
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,000
Come and show me. - For
everything you are asking me.

205
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,120
Then what for are you for?

206
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,600
Sir! It is not comfortable here.
Shall we go there?

207
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,400
Comfortable?
- Thank you!

208
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,400
The dish that I ordered now
its name is Folio Dissuade.

209
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:46,880
In Greek it means dish of love.

210
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,320
Leave us.
- Okay, sir.

211
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,920
There's an interesting
story behind it.

212
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,200
This dish was made for
Julius Caesar and Cleopatra.

213
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:03,480
Any two people who eat this
together.. I mean if we both eat

214
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,800
then our friendship
will turn into

215
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,760
a beautiful relationship.

216
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,160
So, you feed me a spoon

217
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:23,600
and I'll feed a spoon to you.

218
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,920
Shall we start?

219
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:08,280
Don't worry, sir.
Our crackers are fantastic.

220
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,200
From a long time I wanted
to tell you a thing. - Yes.

221
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,200
You're really smart, sir.

222
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:16,080
Your clothes, your dress. Then
I take leave. - Thank you!

223
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,240
See you.
- Okay. Bye, bye!

224
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:22,760
Eat well and be energetic.
You look too slim.

225
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,960
Sir! Dish was very nice.

226
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,160
Cheque.

227
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,320
Hey, stop, stop, stop.

228
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,760
Sir! Please stop.
- What happened?

229
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,840
I'll get down here.
- Here? For what?

230
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,760
I have to buy vegetables.
- Okay. I'll also come.

231
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,680
You are a person who must
be going to share market.

232
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:06,040
What will you do in these kinds
of markets? - What I'm..

233
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,800
Aye! Aye!

234
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:13,600
You leave, sir.
Thank you!

235
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:36,480
Is it Rs 15? It is too much.
Can you make it Rs 5?

236
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:41,280
I can't give. - Okay, no need.
We'll go to another shop.

237
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,080
Hello! Sister-in-law!
- Bindu! Why are you so late?

238
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,280
What are you
still doing in office?

239
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,000
Is it 10 o'clock?
- No. It is just 7 o'clock.

240
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,320
Sorry! Sorry! Today there
was lot of work in office.

241
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,920
Did it have to
run out of petrol now?

242
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,720
Tell me how much is the
cost for all this together?

243
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,720
We won't take money
from you Father.

244
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,600
You bless me. That's enough.
- God bless you my child.

245
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:02,760
Father! Your blessing was
very powerful. Thank you!

246
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,160
Thank you! - Take care.
- What happened?

247
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:09,800
Bindu has sent text.
First time a positive response.

248
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:12,200
It is blank text.

249
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,880
Blank text is like blank
cheque. It is very powerful.

250
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,960
From there she can write
whatever she wants.

251
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,800
From here I can imagine
whatever I want. - Is it?

252
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,240
What does this mean?

253
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,560
Don't waste time idiot.
Come quickly. - Is it?

254
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,680
You texted.
- What text?

255
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,800
You sent blank text.
That is why.

256
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:53,480
Instead of deleting my mistake
I pressed reply. Sorry!

257
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:09,120
It is very late.
You were scared.

258
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,800
You texted me so that
I could accompany you.

259
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:14,440
Don't imagine it all.

260
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,840
It is very late.
I am so scared

261
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:48,080
Shall I also come with you?
- Okay.

262
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:56,960
"Smile for me."

263
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:02,400
"Call me closer."

264
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:07,840
"Talk to me."

265
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,480
"Show me some love."

266
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:19,000
"Show me some dreams."

267
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:24,800
"Make me yours."

268
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:29,960
"No matter what you say."

269
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,840
"I know that."

270
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:42,600
"My name resonates
in your silence."

271
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:47,760
"No matter what you say."
"I know that."

272
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:53,560
"My name resonates
in your silence."

273
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:32,920
"Take a look here."

274
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:38,400
"Look into my eyes."

275
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,320
"Express your feelings."

276
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:52,960
"Open up your heart."

277
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:58,560
"For a single smile."

278
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:04,200
"I can cross the seven oceans."

279
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:08,640
"No matter what the heart says."

280
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,600
"But I belong only to you."

281
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:16,920
"You're my happiness."

282
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,680
"No matter what the heart says."

283
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:22,520
"But I belong only to you."

284
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:27,920
"You're my happiness."

285
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:53,400
"Think about me."

286
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:59,600
"And, I'll come flying to you."

287
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:05,120
"Shower me with your love."

288
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:10,360
"And, the world
will be at your feet."

289
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:15,080
"I promise you."

290
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:21,240
"I'll love you forever."

291
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,560
"No matter what you say."

292
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:28,320
"But hear me."

293
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:33,560
"But my heart dwells in you."

294
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,640
What did you just say?

295
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:39,240
"No matter what you say."

296
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,320
"But hear me."

297
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,720
"But my heart"

298
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:50,520
"dwells in you."

299
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,920
"No matter what you say."

300
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:06,440
"But hear me."

301
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:12,760
"But my heart dwells in you."

302
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:47,160
Sir! Why are you hitting me?

303
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,920
I don't even know you.

304
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,760
Please let me go, please.

305
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:57,960
Every girl is crazy after me.

306
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:03,520
It is because of you
that I'm not getting her.

307
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,520
Damn!

308
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:09,560
Who sir? Who are you
talking about? - Bindu!

309
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:15,640
Go closer to Bindu and..

310
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,800
I'll kill you.

311
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:25,560
You will kill me?
You will kill me?

312
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,360
You'll kill Sudeep!

313
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,440
'Where are you?'

314
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:53,640
Where are you?

315
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:59,160
My Bindu is asking
where you are.

316
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,400
Tell her..

317
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,320
Tell her that you are getting
stamped under my leg and dying.

318
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:09,040
Sir! - Take off my shoe.
Remove the socks.

319
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:14,720
I want to feel your life
slip away.

320
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:22,200
I love you.

321
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:26,240
I love you..

322
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:29,560
I love you.

323
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:48,840
It must look like an accident.

324
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:08,160
Jani! This is Bindu.
I love you.

325
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:14,640
Why are you not talking?

326
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,440
I teased you for 2 years.

327
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:20,040
Are you taking revenge
for that?

328
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:24,280
Please!
Come back soon.

329
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,960
Did you call me?
- Yes, sir I did.

330
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,600
What time you saw the body?
- 6 o'clock in the morning.

331
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,600
Did you enquire any one
about his name or address?

332
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:14,360
What have you done
since morning? Go ask..

333
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,880
Find out about him.

334
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:57,040
Come on, everyone
get back to your work.

335
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,880
Don't crowd the place.

336
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:36,960
"He is back. He is back."

337
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:40,360
"Jani is back."

338
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:45,440
"Jani is back. He is back.
He is back."

339
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:52,080
"Jani is back."

340
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:22,080
Off side.

341
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,120
Catch it.

342
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,960
Hello!

343
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:21,120
Tell me.

344
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,560
Excuse me, sir!

345
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:31,760
Ya! Ya! Ya!
I got it.

346
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:26,160
I'll be there.
Yeah!

347
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:30,280
No. Don't worry.
It'll be taken care of.

348
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,560
Sir! Breakfast.

349
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:02,440
"Your silence will
keep everything in heart."

350
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:13,400
"How do I say I still love you?"

351
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:40,040
"Bindu. Bindu."

352
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:43,080
"My Bindu."

353
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:49,080
"Do not go away
from me."

354
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:04,160
Why did you get ready so soon?
- To office.

355
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:06,720
Your office is at 10 o'clock.
It's 7.

356
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:11,000
Why are you cleaning vessels?

357
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:14,400
The maid would do.
You go and sit.

358
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:16,920
What happened, Bindu?

359
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,160
You used to give thousand
excuses to escape from work.

360
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:22,680
Now you don't remain
idle even for a minute.

361
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:25,280
I'm talking to you...

362
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:31,200
What happened?
- I'm trying to forget somehow.

363
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:34,960
What? Who?

364
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:38,760
Jani.
- Jani?

365
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:44,960
When he was alive I ignored him.

366
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:47,440
Made him chase me.

367
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:52,080
Now he is at a place

368
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:56,520
where I can't reach him.

369
00:45:57,640 --> 00:46:00,600
They say it is easier
to forget by crying.

370
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:04,720
But when I cry I
remember him all the more.

371
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:10,920
That is why I'm not crying.

372
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:28,800
Sir!
- Sit, sit. Please! Sit down.

373
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:35,080
Are you missing Nani?

374
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:39,080
How do you know? - Come on,
Bindu. We are friends.

375
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:46,920
I still remember
my wife's death.

376
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:50,400
When she was in death bed

377
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:55,400
she held my hand
and made me promise.

378
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:59,800
"You must forget me
once I'm dead."

379
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:04,640
She said only when I forget her
she'll get happiness.

380
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:10,880
If you really loved Jani,
you must forget him.

381
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:23,200
Bindu!
Bindu!

382
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:45,280
Relax.

383
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:52,120
Relax now.

384
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:00,640
Come on!

385
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:04,000
Sir! What happened?

386
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:09,120
Nothing.
Nothing. Nothing.

387
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:15,560
Is there any problem, sir?
- No, no. No. Not at all.

388
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:18,280
Are you okay?
- Yeah!

389
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:24,560
I am perfect.
I'm just standing here.

390
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:29,280
What's up?

391
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:36,040
Sir, what happened?

392
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:42,000
I did like this
to make you smile.

393
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:45,160
Thank you, sir!

394
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:46,920
I thought something had
happened to you. - No, no.

395
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:49,880
Did you get scared?
- No, no. Nothing like that.

396
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:52,840
Sir has come.
- Sudeep, sir! Come, come.

397
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:55,000
Sir! What a surprise? - Sir!
- Please! Take your seat sir.

398
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:58,280
I must go. - Would you
like to have biscuit?

399
00:48:58,320 --> 00:48:59,840
He says he wants
go to office, right?

400
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:01,480
Go to your places.

401
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:03,800
Bye, sir!
- Bye!

402
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:05,400
Sorry about that.
- That's okay.

403
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:09,320
Did they have to come now?
- Sir! - Yes.

404
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:16,480
I'll remember
what you said.

405
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:22,640
I'll try to forget Jani.

406
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:52,960
Close it.

407
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:01,160
For half an hour no one should
disturb me. - Okay, sir!

408
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:06,760
Keep it.

409
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:12,400
Always check before?
- Sorry, sir!

410
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:50,000
Is there anyone?

411
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:52,320
Sir! Why did you come here, sir?

412
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:55,760
Open it. - Sir!
Open it.

413
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:01,320
Open it fast.

414
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:11,000
Can't you hear?
- You said not to disturbed.

415
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:15,400
Sir! What are you doing?
- No, sir!

416
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:21,000
No, sir! Don't beat me, sir.
- Don't move.

417
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:25,120
In Ganapati chemical scam
MD was fully exposed.

418
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:26,880
As far as I know
he'll be stripped.

419
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:31,000
What is there to hide?
It is naked truth.

420
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:45,200
Suddenly
you told me to come.

421
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:48,360
I met Education Minister
in Delhi last week.

422
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:52,760
If you meet him and
explain the details,

423
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,400
we'll get national recognition.

424
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:57,560
National level.

425
00:52:57,680 --> 00:52:59,000
Tomorrow
I'm going to Delhi.

426
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:03,360
If one of you comes with me,
I'll introduce to him.

427
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:07,080
So who is gonna come?
- I'll come, sir.

428
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:11,600
Presentation isn't as
easy as eating a pizza.

429
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:14,600
Bindu! You go.
- Me?

430
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:18,480
Last time collector sir also
said your presentation was good.

431
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:21,720
Yes, correct. - What are you
thinking so much? You go.

432
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:24,560
Sir! Bindu will be coming.
- Yes, sir! Bindu is coming.

433
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:27,520
Yes. Bindu will come. - Bindu
we are all saying. Say okay.

434
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:30,560
Say it. - Say. - Okay, sir!
I will go.

435
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:34,080
That's great. Well, Bindu.
Let's meet at airport tomorrow.

436
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:05,880
What the...

437
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:26,760
Sir! - Did you forget
to clean the house?

438
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:31,920
The room is full of flies.
Everywhere it is fly.

439
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,680
'Only pigs come in herds.'

440
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:42,000
'Lion comes alone.'

441
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:48,240
'Comes alone. Comes alone.
Comes alone.'

442
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:51,960
'Comes alone. Comes alone.
Comes alone.'

443
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:54,280
'Comes alone.'

444
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:43,000
Hello!
- It is me Bindu.

445
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:45,360
Sir! It is Bindu speaking.

446
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:49,280
Yes, Bindu!
- I'm at the airport.

447
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:52,080
There is only half an hour
for boarding.

448
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:56,840
I'm on the way, Bindu.
I'll be there in 10 minutes.

449
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:06,120
What the?

450
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:10,040
Shit man!

451
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:15,680
Hello! - Bindu!
There is traffic jam here.

452
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:18,440
Oh no! - Nothing to worry.
Do one thing.

453
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:21,480
You take the boarding
pass. I'll be there on time.

454
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:24,600
I'll come. Okay?
- Okay, sir!

455
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:31,200
Go back!

456
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:52,680
Stop!

457
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:03,760
What is he doing?

458
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:14,680
Move back!

459
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:23,960
Did you have to stop here?

460
00:58:34,040 --> 00:58:36,000
What are you looking at?

461
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:55,120
Wipe it clean.
- Yes, sir! - Hello, sir!

462
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:57,640
Sir, you're here? - My car got
stuck in traffic. I need a car.

463
00:58:57,720 --> 00:58:59,920
You take my car, sir.
Give the key to him.

464
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:04,840
Hello! - Bindu, I'll just reach
in 10 minutes, so..

465
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:06,120
It is okay, sir.

466
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:10,120
Flight is delayed.
You can make it. - I'm coming.

467
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:24,920
"Fly! Fly! Fly!
Search me with your eyes."

468
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:29,160
"Fly! Fly! Fly!

469
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:32,800
"Come out. Come out.
Come out."

470
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:37,680
"Fly! Fly! Fly! Fly!"

471
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:51,560
Fly! Fly! Fly! Fly!"

472
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:50,920
I will kill you.

473
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:59,320
I will kill you.

474
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:38,800
You are really lucky.

475
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:40,119
Though met with
a serious accident

476
01:02:40,199 --> 01:02:41,679
you escaped with minor injuries.

477
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:43,599
Give me your hand,
I'll check your BP.

478
01:02:45,719 --> 01:02:47,199
What is this?
- Hit.

479
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:51,320
You take it. - Give me.
- Not this. Take the BP.

480
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:52,840
Nurse.

481
01:02:59,119 --> 01:03:00,440
I'll give sedation to sleep.

482
01:03:01,638 --> 01:03:03,280
Give him Diazepam 2ml.

483
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:08,679
Take care. Bye!

484
01:03:09,639 --> 01:03:11,079
Sir!

485
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:20,679
Do animals take revenge?

486
01:03:22,759 --> 01:03:24,440
Didn't you hear
what I asked you?

487
01:03:25,239 --> 01:03:27,360
Do animals take revenge?

488
01:03:27,598 --> 01:03:29,639
They do take.
In Barjatiya films.

489
01:03:31,639 --> 01:03:33,880
Not in cinema. In real life.

490
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:36,679
It happens in
real life too, sir.

491
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:39,760
My grandma said!

492
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:42,320
It seems a King Cobra
took revenge on my grandpa.

493
01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:45,679
Not that smaller ones!
- Smaller ones too take revenge.

494
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,719
Others... - Smaller snakes
too take revenge.

495
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:51,280
Not snakes!
Smaller ones...

496
01:03:52,559 --> 01:03:55,679
Like sparrow!

497
01:03:57,440 --> 01:03:59,199
Mouse!

498
01:04:02,079 --> 01:04:05,559
Fly.
- Fly? It'll take.

499
01:04:05,719 --> 01:04:08,199
If snakes can, why not flies?

500
01:04:08,519 --> 01:04:10,079
Such fools.

501
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:14,400
With whom should I share this
problem? How am I to tell?

502
01:04:18,239 --> 01:04:20,038
Sir, Bindu madam is here.

503
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:24,760
Out.

504
01:04:32,119 --> 01:04:35,480
Sir! Are you alright?

505
01:04:35,599 --> 01:04:38,239
Yes, Bindu I am fine. Sit down.

506
01:04:42,199 --> 01:04:44,679
And, thanks for coming.

507
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:48,519
What's in your hand?

508
01:04:48,639 --> 01:04:53,000
This fly is troubling me.

509
01:05:46,599 --> 01:05:49,119
"Bindu! Bindu!"

510
01:05:49,599 --> 01:05:52,239
"My Bindu."

511
01:05:52,599 --> 01:05:57,920
'Don't go away from me."

512
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:53,199
Good morning, Mr. Sudeep!
What a pleasant surprise?

513
01:06:53,239 --> 01:06:56,239
Hi, sir! - Hi! Tell me.
How can I help you?

514
01:06:59,079 --> 01:07:00,679
I have a small doubt.

515
01:07:00,920 --> 01:07:04,840
Do flies target
humans specifically?

516
01:07:05,360 --> 01:07:11,960
I mean remember humans
and attack with a plan.

517
01:07:12,920 --> 01:07:15,279
Sir! Are you writing some
science fiction story?

518
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:17,520
It is not science
fiction. It is a fact.

519
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:25,800
A fly is not letting me to
eat, sleep or live peacefully.

520
01:07:26,360 --> 01:07:28,119
This accident too
is its handiwork!

521
01:07:28,679 --> 01:07:31,239
It wrote 'I will kill
you' on the windshield.

522
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:32,719
Is it science fiction?

523
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:35,079
You said you didn't
sleep all the night.

524
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:36,760
You are in stress.

525
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:39,119
In that stress and sleepiness
you have done the accident.

526
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:42,038
In this you are
disturbed by fly too.

527
01:07:42,159 --> 01:07:44,679
So your brain has registered
it as if it has happened.

528
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:47,279
You need a psychiatrist's help.

529
01:07:53,038 --> 01:07:56,480
You won't find what
you're looking for there.

530
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:10,119
Come.
- Go away.

531
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:12,760
You won't come.

532
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:16,118
Fire in iron box.

533
01:08:16,319 --> 01:08:18,520
Your face is fully black.

534
01:08:18,599 --> 01:08:22,078
That time you'll come to
this 'tantra' yourself.

535
01:08:29,238 --> 01:08:30,920
Madman.

536
01:08:48,719 --> 01:08:50,639
Who is he?
Is this my imagination?

537
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:28,840
Bindu! Come have food.

538
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:32,078
What happened, Bindu?

539
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
Jani's locket got broken.

540
01:09:39,560 --> 01:09:41,760
You know Jani won't
come back again.

541
01:09:42,399 --> 01:09:44,479
For how many days are you going
to keep thinking about him?

542
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:50,038
Along with this locket, I want
you to break that bond as well.

543
01:10:02,680 --> 01:10:10,039
"It's not possible
to forget you?"

544
01:10:15,119 --> 01:10:22,479
"I'm always with you."

545
01:11:46,119 --> 01:11:49,720
Jani! Are you Jani?

546
01:11:52,239 --> 01:11:55,600
Are you really Jani?

547
01:11:58,040 --> 01:12:02,800
I can't believe it.
Jani's rebirth.

548
01:12:03,880 --> 01:12:05,640
You died in accident.

549
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:09,920
Wasn't it an accident?

550
01:12:11,359 --> 01:12:13,359
Then?

551
01:12:29,279 --> 01:12:32,199
Sudeep sir.

552
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:34,399
What Sudeep sir?

553
01:12:41,960 --> 01:12:45,520
Did Sudeep sir

554
01:12:46,119 --> 01:12:49,680
kill you?

555
01:12:52,159 --> 01:12:54,720
Why would he kill you?

556
01:12:59,239 --> 01:13:00,880
For me?

557
01:13:02,199 --> 01:13:04,000
For my sake he killed you?

558
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:30,159
What should we do now?

559
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:53,159
How to kill him?

560
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:06,760
"What's this fire burning
in me?."

561
01:14:09,680 --> 01:14:14,318
"There's just one hope
in this despair."

562
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:34,520
"The name's Jani."

563
01:14:34,559 --> 01:14:38,640
"I'll have you begging
for your life."

564
01:14:41,318 --> 01:14:42,720
"The name's Jani"

565
01:14:42,840 --> 01:14:47,760
"I'll have you begging
for your life."

566
01:14:51,159 --> 01:14:54,680
"I'm soaring through
the skies now"

567
01:14:54,720 --> 01:14:58,318
"now I'll write this story
with your blood."

568
01:14:58,359 --> 01:15:01,760
"I am a fly, don't misjudge me."

569
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:05,760
"I'm the messenger
of your death."

570
01:15:08,559 --> 01:15:11,960
"I am a fly, don't misjudge me."

571
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:15,920
"I'm the messenger
of your death."

572
01:15:47,199 --> 01:15:50,239
"I am a fly.."

573
01:15:50,399 --> 01:15:53,920
"I am a fly."

574
01:15:53,960 --> 01:15:57,279
"I am a fly.."

575
01:15:57,318 --> 01:16:00,640
"I am a fly."

576
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:04,159
"You cannot stop me."

577
01:16:04,199 --> 01:16:08,520
"With a single spark,
you can go up in flames."

578
01:16:09,279 --> 01:16:12,600
"A single drop of poison,
can do its job."

579
01:16:12,680 --> 01:16:16,880
"A single bullet can take life."

580
01:16:17,119 --> 01:16:21,318
"This is the universal
matter before the big bang."

581
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:27,800
"I'm no ordinary fly
that you can get rid of."

582
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:31,159
"I will rest only when you die."

583
01:16:31,199 --> 01:16:36,000
"Look into my eyes,
I can kill you in a snap."

584
01:16:37,359 --> 01:16:39,640
Douse it right now.

585
01:16:43,399 --> 01:16:46,760
"I am a fly, don't misjudge me."

586
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:50,880
"I'm the messenger
of your death."

587
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:57,040
"I am a fly, don't misjudge me."

588
01:16:57,079 --> 01:17:01,079
"I'm the messenger
of your death."

589
01:17:20,680 --> 01:17:27,880
"There are 10 things that
I need to do immediately."

590
01:17:31,079 --> 01:17:34,600
"1. I must kill you.
2. I must kill you."

591
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:37,960
"3. I must kill you.
4. I must kill you."

592
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:41,318
'5. I must kill you.
6. I must kill you.'

593
01:17:41,359 --> 01:17:44,840
"7. I must kill you.
8. I must kill you."

594
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:46,520
"9. I must kill you."

595
01:17:46,559 --> 01:17:49,840
"10. I must make you cry,
frustrated, excited."

596
01:17:49,880 --> 01:17:53,600
"I must scatter you. I must
cut you to pieces and kill you."

597
01:17:59,439 --> 01:18:02,520
"Can you hear the
music of these two wings?"

598
01:18:02,559 --> 01:18:06,680
"Is death message
entering through your ears?"

599
01:18:14,840 --> 01:18:18,318
"Even a fly's feet
will change into spear."

600
01:18:18,359 --> 01:18:22,880
"Only after killing you
my anger will subside."

601
01:18:23,640 --> 01:18:27,600
"Jani is the one who after dying
was reborn and smiled."

602
01:18:30,279 --> 01:18:33,600
"I'm not a fly to just fly
around butter."

603
01:18:33,680 --> 01:18:35,359
"To pierce thorn in your chest"

604
01:18:35,399 --> 01:18:37,000
"I'm a nuisance who has
come as a ghost."

605
01:18:37,159 --> 01:18:41,640
"I'm the villain who has come
to kill you in your territory."

606
01:20:19,479 --> 01:20:21,640
So that's where you hide.

607
01:20:28,760 --> 01:20:31,318
It is caught. It is caught.

608
01:20:31,398 --> 01:20:36,080
Die. Die. Die.

609
01:20:36,720 --> 01:20:39,640
You cannot escape today.
Die.

610
01:20:47,398 --> 01:20:48,760
What happened?

611
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:53,080
Very good.

612
01:20:59,359 --> 01:21:02,279
Excuse me!
- Yes, ma'am!

613
01:21:02,359 --> 01:21:04,479
Cappuccino to me.
For you?

614
01:21:06,559 --> 01:21:07,640
Do you also like that only?

615
01:21:07,680 --> 01:21:09,279
One cappuccino please.

616
01:21:22,120 --> 01:21:23,760
Sorry, ma'am!
There is a fly in the coffee.

617
01:21:23,800 --> 01:21:26,000
No, no. No.
It is drinking coffee.

618
01:21:26,720 --> 01:21:28,680
What is the next plan?

619
01:21:53,239 --> 01:21:55,439
Come here.
- Sir.

620
01:21:55,640 --> 01:21:58,279
Did you order the bullet proof
glasses? - I have done it, sir.

621
01:21:58,318 --> 01:21:59,520
Not just a fly..

622
01:21:59,559 --> 01:22:02,318
even air shouldn't enter without
our knowledge. - Yes, sir.

623
01:22:02,359 --> 01:22:04,439
I want the entire house
air-packed.

624
01:22:38,199 --> 01:22:41,159
Yes. Now I'll see how it enters.

625
01:23:02,439 --> 01:23:04,279
Please! Sit madam.
- Thanks!

626
01:23:20,920 --> 01:23:22,359
Bindu!

627
01:23:23,840 --> 01:23:25,439
Hi, sir!
- Hi.

628
01:23:25,559 --> 01:23:27,239
These antiques are very nice.

629
01:23:27,359 --> 01:23:30,559
Do you like it?
- Yes.

630
01:23:32,239 --> 01:23:35,359
This is my personal collection.

631
01:23:35,640 --> 01:23:38,239
The place you are standing
is wife's favourite spot.

632
01:23:58,479 --> 01:24:00,600
What happened, sir?
- Nothing.

633
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:02,520
Sure.
- Yes.

634
01:24:04,520 --> 01:24:07,840
I like your wife's
favourite spot very much.

635
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:12,520
Full...
Memories.

636
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:16,640
Shall we sit and talk?

637
01:24:16,760 --> 01:24:19,680
No. Yes. Sorry! Come.

638
01:24:19,960 --> 01:24:21,080
Okay.

639
01:24:22,080 --> 01:24:24,880
Sir! Our project.
- Urgent.

640
01:24:24,920 --> 01:24:27,640
I forgot. I have to
urgently go to office.

641
01:24:28,199 --> 01:24:29,640
This way. I am..

642
01:24:29,680 --> 01:24:33,439
I thought
I'll spend some time with you.

643
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:35,760
Can't you go later?

644
01:24:37,318 --> 01:24:39,318
What timing?

645
01:24:40,680 --> 01:24:42,960
I won't take much
of your time.

646
01:24:44,760 --> 01:24:46,439
I think you should
leave now. Come.

647
01:24:46,479 --> 01:24:47,960
Open the door.

648
01:24:49,398 --> 01:24:51,600
I'll see you later.
- Okay, sir!

649
01:24:54,680 --> 01:24:58,080
"Fly! Fly! Fly!
In both my eyes there is fire."

650
01:24:58,120 --> 01:25:02,080
"I'll change your house into
hell. You wait and see."

651
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:08,239
"Fly! Fly! Fly!
In both my eyes there is fire."

652
01:25:08,359 --> 01:25:12,279
"I'll change your house into
hell. You wait and see."

653
01:25:27,920 --> 01:25:31,960
I beg you.
Don't spoil this meeting.

654
01:25:33,640 --> 01:25:36,559
They have come to invest
two thousand crores.

655
01:25:36,600 --> 01:25:38,880
If you spoil this,
we'll lose two thousand crores.

656
01:25:38,920 --> 01:25:40,479
Not only that we'll have to
return the 500 crores with

657
01:25:40,559 --> 01:25:42,239
interest which they
have given as advance.

658
01:25:42,279 --> 01:25:45,199
Of course.
Don't I know all this?

659
01:25:45,239 --> 01:25:48,159
I'm sure you'll like it
after our presentation, sir.

660
01:25:48,199 --> 01:25:50,479
Sir! This is the latest design.
- Have you sent this?

661
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:52,920
Sir! - Yes.
- No. It is okay.

662
01:25:53,680 --> 01:25:55,880
Gentlemen!
We are ready.

663
01:25:55,960 --> 01:25:59,239
Will you please welcome our
managing director Mr. Sudeep?

664
01:26:08,199 --> 01:26:11,600
Don't be surprised. We all
know how fond he is of racing.

665
01:26:11,640 --> 01:26:13,880
He has symbolically worn
this helmet to show that our

666
01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:16,120
project would also be
completed with that speed.

667
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:20,640
Helmet.
- All the best. All the best.

668
01:26:20,680 --> 01:26:24,640
Don't put us to shame.
It is two thousand crores.

669
01:26:25,920 --> 01:26:27,239
Switch it on.

670
01:26:28,359 --> 01:26:31,279
Gentlemen!
Sudeep's space city.

671
01:26:31,398 --> 01:26:34,640
This is going to be the biggest
residential township in India.

672
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:38,920
With your investment we
have bought 5000 ton steel.

673
01:26:39,080 --> 01:26:43,199
10,000 ton cement. 50,000
ton medicine to kill flies.

674
01:26:43,520 --> 01:26:46,359
Over that.. - What?
Flies killing medicine?

675
01:26:46,840 --> 01:26:48,279
Jelly stone.

676
01:26:48,359 --> 01:26:51,920
Why fly killing medicine?
Am I scared of fly?

677
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:54,359
Jelly stone.

678
01:26:54,600 --> 01:26:57,800
Of course, they
can kill flies too.

679
01:26:57,920 --> 01:26:59,279
Lights.

680
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:01,398
If someone has to buy our flats

681
01:27:01,439 --> 01:27:05,640
each person should kill
5000 flies. How is that?

682
01:27:05,720 --> 01:27:07,398
Next, next.

683
01:27:07,840 --> 01:27:11,080
After all the flies are dead

684
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:15,359
Sudeep township will be
very peaceful.

685
01:27:15,439 --> 01:27:20,000
Peaceful, happiness
and silent it'll be.

686
01:27:23,800 --> 01:27:27,040
Mr. Sudeep! What nonsense?
That's enough I say.

687
01:27:27,199 --> 01:27:29,398
Is this board meeting
or class room to teach

688
01:27:29,439 --> 01:27:32,600
how to kill
flies and mosquitoes?

689
01:27:32,720 --> 01:27:34,800
It is ridiculous I say.

690
01:27:35,840 --> 01:27:37,600
Sir..
- I missed it.

691
01:27:37,640 --> 01:27:40,479
Mr. Sudeep! Why are you hitting?
- Hit won't work.

692
01:27:40,640 --> 01:27:42,960
I have used hit. The fly is
not dying with that. I know.

693
01:27:43,040 --> 01:27:44,960
Have you gone mad?

694
01:27:48,559 --> 01:27:50,640
What is he doing?

695
01:27:50,720 --> 01:27:53,279
Somebody stop him.
- This guy is really...

696
01:27:56,040 --> 01:27:59,520
He's a nutcase.
- Don't move. Don't move.

697
01:27:59,800 --> 01:28:01,159
Wait there.

698
01:28:01,680 --> 01:28:05,359
What is he going to do?
No, no. Stop it. No.

699
01:28:07,159 --> 01:28:08,880
Please, sir! Please, sir!
- Sorry, sir!

700
01:28:08,920 --> 01:28:12,880
Please sir, listen to me. Please
sit, I'll explain everything.

701
01:28:14,640 --> 01:28:16,120
Put commissioner on the line.

702
01:28:17,040 --> 01:28:21,479
I'll give you a tip.
Immediately raid...

703
01:28:23,760 --> 01:28:25,920
Sir..
We are caught.

704
01:28:25,960 --> 01:28:28,720
That Mukesh Duggal phoned
income tax officer.

705
01:28:28,760 --> 01:28:30,640
He has told him to raid
our office. He tipped him.

706
01:28:30,720 --> 01:28:33,080
The entire cash is
in the office.

707
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:53,600
Aye!

708
01:29:55,800 --> 01:29:58,080
No.

709
01:29:59,680 --> 01:30:01,479
Open up.

710
01:30:05,359 --> 01:30:09,279
No.

711
01:30:18,398 --> 01:30:19,960
Fire in iron box.

712
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:24,000
There will be black stain
all over your face.

713
01:30:24,040 --> 01:30:28,120
That time you'll come
searching for this Tantra.

714
01:30:32,640 --> 01:30:33,960
Tantra!

715
01:30:36,840 --> 01:30:38,080
Tan...

716
01:30:44,920 --> 01:30:48,960
Tantra! I lost everything.
It happened as you said.

717
01:31:12,398 --> 01:31:15,920
The seed to kill you
has been sown here.

718
01:31:30,439 --> 01:31:32,680
Here's where I killed Jani.

719
01:31:33,960 --> 01:31:36,640
Jani.
Fly.

720
01:31:37,239 --> 01:31:39,880
It is he who has
been born as fly.

721
01:31:40,559 --> 01:31:44,359
Don't go close to
Bindu. I'll kill you.

722
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:55,559
What you said is true.

723
01:31:56,120 --> 01:31:57,600
It is Jani.

724
01:31:58,960 --> 01:32:00,199
Now what to do?

725
01:32:00,279 --> 01:32:04,960
Immediately veneration
has to be done.

726
01:35:00,520 --> 01:35:03,398
It's stuck. See there.

727
01:36:24,279 --> 01:36:26,760
Don't go near Bindu.
Else I'll kill you.

728
01:36:27,520 --> 01:36:29,080
I'll kill you.

729
01:37:00,438 --> 01:37:01,600
Hello!

730
01:37:09,639 --> 01:37:11,960
Sudeep! Sudeep!.

731
01:37:18,478 --> 01:37:20,199
What is this?

732
01:37:20,239 --> 01:37:23,880
Pot, skeleton, skull.
What is happening here?

733
01:37:25,600 --> 01:37:28,000
Okay. Whose dead body is that?

734
01:37:28,680 --> 01:37:29,920
Tantra's.

735
01:37:30,199 --> 01:37:33,719
Why did he come here?
- He came to kill fly.

736
01:37:33,760 --> 01:37:35,318
Fly, fly. Fly.

737
01:37:35,559 --> 01:37:38,279
After all it's a small fly. Will
you be scared of it like this?

738
01:37:39,639 --> 01:37:43,160
Small fly?
Do you know what it can do?

739
01:37:44,639 --> 01:37:47,639
You bear it. If you are a man,
you bear it and show me.

740
01:37:47,719 --> 01:37:49,840
You show it to me.
- Get lost.

741
01:37:50,439 --> 01:37:53,920
You have gone crazy.
- What I'm saying is true.

742
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:58,240
That fly is Jani.
The one I killed.

743
01:37:58,639 --> 01:38:02,200
He has been reborn.

744
01:38:02,719 --> 01:38:06,240
That fly made me suffer an
accident. It burnt our money.

745
01:38:06,920 --> 01:38:09,559
I made many arrangements so that
it must not enter this house.

746
01:38:10,200 --> 01:38:12,840
So that even air
doesn't enter this house.

747
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:15,800
From where does that fly come?

748
01:38:33,200 --> 01:38:34,559
What happened?

749
01:38:52,478 --> 01:38:54,920
What is this?

750
01:38:57,840 --> 01:39:01,398
Mask, weapons for a fly.

751
01:39:05,359 --> 01:39:08,680
Bindu is removing the screw.

752
01:39:11,200 --> 01:39:15,719
That means what you said
is true. Jani is that fly.

753
01:39:15,760 --> 01:39:17,279
Oh my God!

754
01:39:17,359 --> 01:39:21,478
Sorry! Even after you told me
I didn't believe you.

755
01:39:28,200 --> 01:39:31,120
Now we know that
Bindu is behind this fly.

756
01:39:31,160 --> 01:39:34,240
It is not a big thing to
finish her. That I'll manage.

757
01:39:34,318 --> 01:39:38,080
But before that the investors
have said that they'll finish us

758
01:39:38,520 --> 01:39:41,680
If we don't pay money by
tomorrow, they'll go to court.

759
01:39:41,719 --> 01:39:43,960
First we must stop that.

760
01:39:45,920 --> 01:39:50,559
If one of the partners die,
the contract will get cancelled.

761
01:39:51,520 --> 01:39:53,398
Not only that.

762
01:39:54,960 --> 01:39:56,800
We'll get 700 crores
insurance money too.

763
01:39:56,960 --> 01:40:01,200
What are you saying? For that
are you going to commit suicide?

764
01:40:34,920 --> 01:40:39,000
Jani! Jani! Where are you?

765
01:40:40,200 --> 01:40:41,520
Jani!

766
01:40:43,359 --> 01:40:44,760
Where are you?

767
01:40:44,920 --> 01:40:47,680
Are you playing hide and seek?
Okay.

768
01:41:09,680 --> 01:41:12,920
Bindu! Why did you get shocked?

769
01:41:14,240 --> 01:41:16,680
Is it because I came upstairs?

770
01:41:17,279 --> 01:41:20,318
The door was open downstairs.
That is why I came..

771
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:25,359
Sorry, I scared you.
- It is okay, sir.

772
01:41:26,920 --> 01:41:29,920
I need to tell an
important thing.

773
01:41:31,040 --> 01:41:33,760
Will you come with me?
- I have to go somewhere else.

774
01:41:33,800 --> 01:41:35,080
Please!

775
01:41:41,439 --> 01:41:44,080
I hope you won't consider
me mad on hearing what I say.

776
01:41:47,279 --> 01:41:49,840
A fly is trying to kill me.

777
01:41:51,559 --> 01:41:52,960
You don't believe me?

778
01:41:55,240 --> 01:41:57,318
And what's more
shocking is that..

779
01:41:58,520 --> 01:42:03,200
Someone is helping
that fly in killing me.

780
01:42:05,680 --> 01:42:07,040
Do you believe it?

781
01:42:07,520 --> 01:42:09,639
If you say so..

782
01:42:11,478 --> 01:42:13,000
I'm sorry.

783
01:42:13,120 --> 01:42:16,840
When I say this
everyone says I'm mad.

784
01:42:17,760 --> 01:42:20,000
Come on.
Sit down.

785
01:42:21,559 --> 01:42:22,639
Look.

786
01:42:24,200 --> 01:42:26,040
It's a close circuit
camera footage.

787
01:42:26,840 --> 01:42:28,800
While zooming in.

788
01:42:29,439 --> 01:42:34,080
There is glass,
mask on its face.

789
01:42:34,279 --> 01:42:36,880
Did you see? Look.
Miracle.

790
01:42:37,520 --> 01:42:41,639
But how can a fly do all this?

791
01:42:41,719 --> 01:42:44,318
Someone must have made
it and made him wear this.

792
01:42:45,279 --> 01:42:48,960
Hey, don't cry.
Silly girl.

793
01:42:49,040 --> 01:42:50,600
Nothing will happen to me.

794
01:42:53,520 --> 01:42:55,279
These tiny things

795
01:42:55,359 --> 01:42:58,439
can be made only by
micro artists.

796
01:43:00,880 --> 01:43:04,680
Who could be the micro
artist who is trying to kill me?

797
01:43:06,040 --> 01:43:07,279
I mean

798
01:43:08,639 --> 01:43:10,318
you are also a micro artist.

799
01:43:11,680 --> 01:43:15,639
Do you know anyone who
wants to kill me, Bindu?

800
01:43:34,639 --> 01:43:38,760
Sudeep makes
girls dance to his tunes.

801
01:43:40,240 --> 01:43:44,960
You made me run
behind a fly like a fool.

802
01:43:45,760 --> 01:43:50,318
Jani! Come out. Come.

803
01:43:50,520 --> 01:43:52,960
I know you are here.

804
01:43:53,680 --> 01:43:58,478
Like always you come in
zig zag way

805
01:43:59,080 --> 01:44:02,240
making buzzing sounds.

806
01:44:02,478 --> 01:44:05,880
Come and face me.
Otherwise

807
01:44:06,240 --> 01:44:08,760
I'll cut her throat.

808
01:44:09,160 --> 01:44:11,478
Come, Jani! Come.

809
01:44:28,520 --> 01:44:32,318
You don't know how I
killed him in previous birth.

810
01:44:32,398 --> 01:44:34,200
Remove my shoe.

811
01:44:36,880 --> 01:44:41,680
I must feel the life
going out of your body.

812
01:44:53,439 --> 01:44:57,760
Sir! What happened?

813
01:45:17,800 --> 01:45:19,760
Go and catch her.

814
01:45:25,840 --> 01:45:27,559
You're dead for sure today.

815
01:45:48,680 --> 01:45:50,040
He escaped.

816
01:46:59,160 --> 01:47:02,200
Where are the bullets?
- That was all we had.

817
01:48:06,680 --> 01:48:09,520
Drag her here.
- I couldn't find her.

818
01:48:10,200 --> 01:48:11,478
Did she escape?
- No, sir!

819
01:48:11,520 --> 01:48:13,040
The doors are closed.
Security is also there.

820
01:48:13,080 --> 01:48:16,160
The back door is also closed.
There is no chance to escape.

821
01:48:16,318 --> 01:48:17,559
Find her.

822
01:48:51,478 --> 01:48:56,279
He is caught. He is caught.
Yes, yes.

823
01:48:59,279 --> 01:49:02,840
You made my life
miserable for 20 days.

824
01:49:02,880 --> 01:49:06,120
And now that you are caught..

825
01:49:07,359 --> 01:49:09,359
That too here.

826
01:49:10,439 --> 01:49:13,200
Do you want to believe this?

827
01:49:34,920 --> 01:49:36,398
Jani!

828
01:49:38,240 --> 01:49:41,120
I'm coming.

829
01:49:41,960 --> 01:49:44,760
Please, sir! Please!

830
01:49:46,318 --> 01:49:50,880
See how nicely it is flying now.
Marvellous.

831
01:50:00,318 --> 01:50:01,920
Catch it. Catch it.

832
01:50:05,279 --> 01:50:07,559
Prick here. Here.
- No, sir!

833
01:50:07,600 --> 01:50:10,200
Prick there.
- Please, sir! I beg you.

834
01:50:18,639 --> 01:50:21,960
Leave us, sir.
Please, sir! Please!

835
01:50:22,160 --> 01:50:24,920
The game has started.

836
01:50:25,120 --> 01:50:26,200
You are telling me to
stop it so soon.

837
01:50:26,279 --> 01:50:30,318
You both made my life miserable.

838
01:50:30,439 --> 01:50:32,359
You asked me to stop.

839
01:51:06,719 --> 01:51:08,478
Continue..

840
01:51:09,439 --> 01:51:10,880
Where did we stop?

841
01:51:12,559 --> 01:51:13,960
I was laughing.

842
01:51:17,920 --> 01:51:21,000
Bindu! You are missing him.
Concentrate.

843
01:51:21,120 --> 01:51:24,760
You prick in such a way that
his heart must be pierced open.

844
01:51:31,520 --> 01:51:33,318
Did you think
I'll prick him, Bindu?

845
01:51:41,800 --> 01:51:43,000
Jani!

846
01:52:10,279 --> 01:52:13,600
Okay, okay.

847
01:52:18,120 --> 01:52:21,000
Do you communicate
to each other?

848
01:52:22,398 --> 01:52:23,559
What did he say?

849
01:52:25,080 --> 01:52:26,760
What the hell did he say?

850
01:52:39,240 --> 01:52:41,478
Don't worry about him.

851
01:52:42,559 --> 01:52:45,000
I will kill him before I die.

852
01:52:46,279 --> 01:52:47,318
Hell!

853
01:52:47,359 --> 01:52:50,600
Burn him and smash him.

854
01:52:50,840 --> 01:52:52,600
Will you kill me?

855
01:52:52,840 --> 01:52:56,318
Even while dying he can't
let go off his arrogance.

856
01:52:56,520 --> 01:52:59,559
I'll show him what is burning.

857
01:52:59,639 --> 01:53:02,120
Give me the matches.

858
01:53:10,800 --> 01:53:16,478
'My death and my life
are for you.'

859
01:53:17,120 --> 01:53:23,160
'I'll give my life and save you.
My love!'

860
01:53:32,680 --> 01:53:34,680
You'll die.

861
01:54:24,439 --> 01:54:25,840
Run!

862
01:55:43,240 --> 01:55:47,080
Hi, Babe! What's up?
You are looking hot.

863
01:55:47,120 --> 01:55:48,639
Oh my God.

864
01:55:48,680 --> 01:55:51,200
Let's go. - Don't go near
Bindu..

865
01:55:52,398 --> 01:55:53,800
