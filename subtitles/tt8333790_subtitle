1
00:03:01,441 --> 00:03:04,984
In mythology, the demon Kalingan
took the form of a serpent...

2
00:03:04,984 --> 00:03:07,025
...to kill Lord Kannan.

3
00:03:07,025 --> 00:03:13,108
Kannan killed Kalingan
 by dancing on his head.

4
00:03:14,817 --> 00:03:19,191
Kalingan asked for forgiveness
in humanoid form, at his last breath.

5
00:03:19,191 --> 00:03:24,066
He asked for a boon to metamorphose
 in any form whenever he wish.

6
00:03:26,358 --> 00:03:31,441
The merciful Lord Kannan,
bestowed his boon.

7
00:03:31,441 --> 00:03:37,984
The lineage of Kalingan,
in the form of serpents...

8
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:40,650
...are these Itchadharis.

9
00:03:42,608 --> 00:03:50,441
These Itchadharis still lives in Rajanaganathapuram,
the southern district of Tamil Nadu.

10
00:03:50,441 --> 00:03:58,608
They lead the life like humans at day
and suffer as serpents in night.

11
00:04:06,108 --> 00:04:13,108
To get relieved of this curse,
these Itchadharis prayed Naganathaswamy.

12
00:04:13,108 --> 00:04:17,025
He heed their prayers and
 on the day,

13
00:04:17,025 --> 00:04:20,108
Which comes once in twelve years...

14
00:04:20,108 --> 00:04:23,149
 ...is the "auspicious full moon day"
(Maha Chitra Poornima)

15
00:04:23,149 --> 00:04:29,233
By taking the miraculous
nuptial thread made by him...

16
00:04:30,275 --> 00:04:34,400
...and keeping that on his feet,

17
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,817
Both the couples must take holy bath
and wearing holy clothes...

18
00:04:38,817 --> 00:04:42,692
 ...and after performing pooja
 to  Lord Naganathaswamy,

19
00:04:42,692 --> 00:04:46,316
The male serpent
which is in humanoid form...

20
00:04:46,316 --> 00:04:49,025
...must tie the nuptial thread
to the female serpent.

21
00:04:49,025 --> 00:04:55,358
If done so, both the serpents
can be relieved from the curse...

22
00:04:55,358 --> 00:04:57,817
 ...and lead their life as humans.

23
00:04:57,817 --> 00:05:04,608
That's the boon bestowed
 from Lord Naganathaswamy.

24
00:05:05,775 --> 00:05:10,942
In their life, the serpents try once
to take that nuptial thread.

25
00:05:10,942 --> 00:05:14,650
If they fail to take,
 they'll safeguard that nuptial thread...

26
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:22,608
...not to be taken by other Itchadharis.

27
00:05:24,316 --> 00:05:28,858
When the doomed serpents safeguard,

28
00:05:28,858 --> 00:05:36,775
 Today is the "auspicious full moon day"
which comes once in twelve years.

29
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:46,497
Who should be born to whom is
 decided by destiny.

30
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:53,291
Who should get married to whom
 is also decided by the destiny.

31
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,209
Sometimes, that "destiny"
acts cruelly.

32
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:06,000
The companion for this child
 born in the Government hospital...

33
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,333
...is not a human being.

34
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,622
But, a serpent!

35
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,541
An Itchadhari snake has born
 to be a companion for this child.

36
00:07:38,775 --> 00:07:44,400
(A musical line from movie "VEDALAM")

37
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,316
Oh my god,
 she looks awesome!

38
00:07:50,650 --> 00:08:04,567
(A musical line from movie "VEDALAM")

39
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:06,108
Yes, mam.

40
00:08:06,108 --> 00:08:07,984
One large brandy.

41
00:08:12,775 --> 00:08:14,441
Hey, clear out.

42
00:08:14,441 --> 00:08:16,066
Greetings!

43
00:08:16,525 --> 00:08:18,108
How are you?

44
00:08:18,984 --> 00:08:21,233
I've come as per your liking.

45
00:08:21,233 --> 00:08:24,066
Come on, we'll dance.

46
00:08:24,608 --> 00:08:26,316
You like me, isn't it?
 -don't behave like a mad.

47
00:08:27,567 --> 00:08:29,316
How long will you be in distance?

48
00:08:29,316 --> 00:08:31,483
You're mine, ever.

49
00:08:36,984 --> 00:08:38,942
Oh no, she stares at me.

50
00:08:40,149 --> 00:08:42,567
Hey, why didn't he look at me?

51
00:08:42,567 --> 00:08:45,025
Madam, I'm admiring you.
 Isn't it?

52
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:46,775
What did you say last night
on phone?

53
00:08:46,775 --> 00:08:48,567
The first time,
when I saw you in train...

54
00:08:48,567 --> 00:08:49,441
Leave that.

55
00:08:49,441 --> 00:08:51,316
What's the idea you gave?

56
00:08:51,316 --> 00:08:54,817
If a girl sports with a silk saree,
 and jasmine flowers,

57
00:08:54,817 --> 00:08:58,984
And bow their heads,
 guys will like them a lot.

58
00:08:59,149 --> 00:09:01,567
Guys will walk tall
with attitude.

59
00:09:01,567 --> 00:09:03,650
But, we girls should
bow our heads.

60
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:04,858
Yes, madam.

61
00:09:09,858 --> 00:09:11,692
Thank you very much, brother.

62
00:09:11,692 --> 00:09:12,984
For what?

63
00:09:12,984 --> 00:09:15,108
Even if I'm in your stance,
  I would've accepted her love.

64
00:09:15,108 --> 00:09:17,775
When such a beautiful girl
 proposed.

65
00:09:17,775 --> 00:09:19,984
But, you rejected her,
 for the sole reason...

66
00:09:19,984 --> 00:09:22,608
... as your colleague loves her.

67
00:09:22,608 --> 00:09:23,984
You're an exceptional guy.

68
00:09:23,984 --> 00:09:25,858
Maintain this at tonight's party too.

69
00:09:25,858 --> 00:09:27,817
Is she a girl?

70
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:29,984
Always cracking and chasing.

71
00:09:29,984 --> 00:09:31,400
She expressed in public
that she got vibes.

72
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,233
Will a man marry her?
-Brother...

73
00:09:33,233 --> 00:09:33,650
Sorry.

74
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:35,483
I said by mistake,
unaware she is your girlfriend.

75
00:09:35,483 --> 00:09:38,191
It's good, that he believes her
 to be my girlfriend.

76
00:09:38,191 --> 00:09:40,567
He must be a
 "Chin-Chan fan(Cartoon)" fan.

77
00:09:46,525 --> 00:09:52,066
 Trigen..Takila...Vodka...
Shorbam...soju...shangria...mardani...

78
00:09:52,066 --> 00:09:52,483
"Have it..."

79
00:09:52,483 --> 00:09:53,900
"A quarter cutting,"

80
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,358
"A half for sitting,"

81
00:09:55,358 --> 00:09:56,858
"A full for sharing,"

82
00:09:56,858 --> 00:09:58,358
"Have it..."

83
00:09:58,358 --> 00:09:59,900
"Water for Brandy,"

84
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,358
"Soda for Whiskey,"

85
00:10:01,358 --> 00:10:02,692
"Cola for Rum..."

86
00:10:02,692 --> 00:10:04,025
"No more worries..."

87
00:10:04,025 --> 00:10:09,858
"My heart feels ecstasy
when looking at the stuff..."

88
00:10:09,858 --> 00:10:15,984
"My body struggles
as a cargo wood"

89
00:10:15,984 --> 00:10:19,316
"Hey, have the liquor..."
"It's good, if you pour..."

90
00:10:19,316 --> 00:10:25,733
"Another round...
Go ahead, another round..."

91
00:10:36,525 --> 00:10:38,275
I love you.

92
00:10:38,275 --> 00:10:40,108
Are you going to leave?

93
00:10:40,108 --> 00:10:41,483
Tell me your love and go.

94
00:10:43,316 --> 00:10:44,733
"Pour and drink...
pour and drink..."

95
00:10:44,733 --> 00:10:46,275
"Drink high... "

96
00:10:46,275 --> 00:10:49,316
"If you want, take high
Don't lock the door..."

97
00:10:49,316 --> 00:10:52,275
 "Tap the glass,"
"Now hit as, Cheers..."

98
00:10:52,275 --> 00:10:55,066
"Even the dummy piece
shows mass now..."

99
00:10:55,066 --> 00:10:58,275
"The person in ecstasy,
 always speaks the truth".

100
00:10:58,275 --> 00:11:01,233
"He forgets about the caste
 and laughs together in the bar."

101
00:11:01,233 --> 00:11:04,233
"The time will be ten."
"It hurts to leave the bar"

102
00:11:04,233 --> 00:11:07,191
"Have the liquor..."
"It's good, if you pour..."

103
00:11:07,191 --> 00:11:13,984
"Another round...
Go ahead, another round..."

104
00:11:16,108 --> 00:11:17,400
Better vouch your love now.

105
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,233
Or else, I'll bang you on mouth.

106
00:11:19,233 --> 00:11:20,650
If you deny,

107
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:24,275
I'll throw acid on your face,
 when you aren't for me.

108
00:11:24,275 --> 00:11:25,441
"Enjoy the liquor...
Bite the snacks..."

109
00:11:25,441 --> 00:11:31,692
"Aah...aah... enjoy...
Hey...hey...bite it..."

110
00:11:37,149 --> 00:11:40,358
"Dude, the Kith and kin are false..."

111
00:11:40,358 --> 00:11:43,108
"I see the heaven
when I enjoy with liquor."

112
00:11:43,108 --> 00:11:45,900
"The worries will wane away..."

113
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:49,108
"If you let the sorrow stick on you,
the life will be sad."

114
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:51,942
"Our happiness lies in the liquor"

115
00:11:51,942 --> 00:11:55,191
"You get into the water and dance"

116
00:11:55,191 --> 00:11:58,191
"Uncle, you listen me singing
when in high spirit,"

117
00:11:58,191 --> 00:12:01,191
"All those who drunk are youngsters...'

118
00:12:01,191 --> 00:12:04,191
*Under the tree of spirits,
Arises the wisdom...

119
00:12:04,191 --> 00:12:07,108
"I'm standing unsteady,
and shouting in high pitch."

120
00:12:07,108 --> 00:12:12,858
"Another round...
Go ahead, another round..."

121
00:12:25,191 --> 00:12:28,233
"Another round... "

122
00:12:28,233 --> 00:12:31,149
"One more round..."

123
00:12:31,149 --> 00:12:34,525
"Another round..."

124
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,942
"One more..."

125
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:39,149
A bride is in Tambaram.

126
00:13:39,149 --> 00:13:41,149
We saw her yesterday.

127
00:13:41,149 --> 00:13:43,149
She is a good girl.

128
00:13:43,149 --> 00:13:45,441
Even the horoscope matches well.

129
00:13:45,441 --> 00:13:46,608
Hey what, my son?

130
00:13:47,441 --> 00:13:49,650
Dear, look at him.

131
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:51,275
Tell me something.

132
00:13:51,275 --> 00:13:56,191
Sarva, she keeps speaking
but you leave just ignoring her.

133
00:13:56,191 --> 00:13:57,817
Did I ask you to
look for a match?

134
00:13:57,817 --> 00:13:59,441
You proceed when I ask so.

135
00:13:59,441 --> 00:14:00,900
Why are you still thinking
 about the past?

136
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:03,275
Why are you speaking
 like past and present?

137
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:05,441
Still, the past is in my mind.

138
00:14:05,942 --> 00:14:08,066
Dad, let me be free,
please.

139
00:14:12,233 --> 00:14:15,025
In this world, if anyone knows
that the girl he is in love...

140
00:14:15,025 --> 00:14:18,858
...falls for the other guy,
he'll kill her.

141
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:21,817
Wait, let me finish.

142
00:14:21,984 --> 00:14:23,650
But, you...

143
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:26,858
You're proposing another guy
when I'm next to you.

144
00:14:27,108 --> 00:14:32,483
The reason, I'm not angry still
because, I'm your Purush.(husband)

145
00:14:32,483 --> 00:14:35,608
Do you know,
why I tolerate all these?

146
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:37,942
Just because of the hope,
that someday you'll come...

147
00:14:37,942 --> 00:14:41,066
... to this Purush (husband)
 leaving your love.

148
00:14:41,066 --> 00:14:43,441
Sir, please, look front
and drive.

149
00:14:43,441 --> 00:14:45,608
It's a disturbance for us
when you turn often.

150
00:14:45,608 --> 00:14:46,817
Get lost.

151
00:14:46,817 --> 00:14:52,733
Madam, if you look at him henceforth,
you can't see your Purush(husband) alive.

152
00:14:52,733 --> 00:14:55,149
It's better to die now.

153
00:15:04,233 --> 00:15:05,441
Is it here?

154
00:15:06,149 --> 00:15:07,608
Yes, madam.

155
00:15:07,984 --> 00:15:09,984
Here only, Sarva....
 -what?

156
00:15:09,984 --> 00:15:12,025
Your lover,
 s here now.

157
00:15:14,025 --> 00:15:15,108
Thank you very much.

158
00:15:15,441 --> 00:15:16,692
No mention.

159
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:20,775
How much?

160
00:15:20,775 --> 00:15:23,066
I don't want this shameless money.

161
00:15:24,025 --> 00:15:25,149
Thank you for the free ride.

162
00:15:25,149 --> 00:15:26,692
Get lost.

163
00:15:28,733 --> 00:15:31,692
Dude, watch this video.
-Show me.

164
00:15:32,025 --> 00:15:33,149
It's good, right?

165
00:15:33,733 --> 00:15:34,817
I didn't see.

166
00:15:34,817 --> 00:15:35,984
It's the trending viral video.

167
00:15:35,984 --> 00:15:36,650
Oh.
 -it's nice, isn't it?

168
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:38,984
Hi...

169
00:15:38,984 --> 00:15:40,025
Who are you?

170
00:15:40,441 --> 00:15:41,733
His girl friend.

171
00:15:41,733 --> 00:15:42,316
Hey,

172
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:44,733
Come on, be seated.
-Hey,

173
00:15:44,733 --> 00:15:45,858
Its okay, let her sit.

174
00:15:46,108 --> 00:15:47,191
Be seated.

175
00:15:48,025 --> 00:15:49,191
Thank you.

176
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,233
Sir, who are you?

177
00:15:51,233 --> 00:15:52,525
Her (Purush) husband.

178
00:15:52,525 --> 00:15:54,316
Sir.. superb sir.

179
00:15:54,316 --> 00:15:57,191
How good it would've been,
if my girlfriend had a husband like you.

180
00:15:57,191 --> 00:15:59,567
We're afraid to live everyday.

181
00:16:00,275 --> 00:16:01,775
You're great, sir.

182
00:16:01,775 --> 00:16:03,025
Okay, you shameless.
 -hey,

183
00:16:03,025 --> 00:16:04,441
Tell your full name.

184
00:16:04,441 --> 00:16:07,191
Saying as Purush(husband) everywhere.

185
00:16:07,191 --> 00:16:08,567
Sorry, madam.

186
00:16:09,108 --> 00:16:11,191
Brother, my name is Purushothaman.

187
00:16:11,191 --> 00:16:14,650
Right from my childhood,
everyone calls me fondly as "Purush"

188
00:16:15,233 --> 00:16:15,942
From when they started calling me
 "Purush"....

189
00:16:15,942 --> 00:16:17,441
Hey, enough.

190
00:16:17,441 --> 00:16:19,858
No one allows me to speak.

191
00:16:21,233 --> 00:16:22,567
We're in love for three years.

192
00:16:22,567 --> 00:16:24,525
Hey congrats, dude.

193
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:26,191
Hey,
- for three years?

194
00:16:26,191 --> 00:16:29,984
If you torture me next time
saying as you love me,

195
00:16:29,984 --> 00:16:31,525
I'll bang you.

196
00:16:31,525 --> 00:16:33,692
Come on.
 -thank god.

197
00:16:33,692 --> 00:16:35,483
Thank you, brother.

198
00:16:39,108 --> 00:16:42,858
I won't leave you
how far you go.

199
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:48,400
Hi friends, nowadays the news
flash in Facebook before dailies.

200
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:51,608
That's why, I'm sharing
my problem here.

201
00:16:51,608 --> 00:16:53,942
I'm in deep love with a guy.

202
00:16:54,025 --> 00:16:56,817
I met him first at a success party.

203
00:16:57,275 --> 00:16:59,441
I don't know, why I like him?

204
00:16:59,441 --> 00:17:01,817
But, I liked him at first sight.

205
00:17:02,108 --> 00:17:07,525
I behaved mad to him
instead not knowing how to propose.

206
00:17:07,942 --> 00:17:12,858
So, please give me notions
to make him to fall in love.

207
00:17:13,025 --> 00:17:16,233
As you didn't say
who is the guy you're in love...

208
00:17:16,233 --> 00:17:19,858
...my wife is dubious on me.

209
00:17:19,984 --> 00:17:24,942
If you want to succeed in love,
change your name 'Divya' as 'Kavya'.

210
00:17:24,942 --> 00:17:26,650
You must contact,

211
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:28,149
Name, L. Perumagan

212
00:17:28,149 --> 00:17:29,149
MGR Nagar,

213
00:17:29,149 --> 00:17:31,733
Kundalakesi street,
Chennai-78.

214
00:17:31,733 --> 00:17:32,692
Hey, you cheat...

215
00:17:32,692 --> 00:17:37,191
When asked for notion to love,
you're fluorishing your business.

216
00:17:37,316 --> 00:17:39,567
Fear, ignorance, instinctive ability
and shyness...

217
00:17:39,567 --> 00:17:42,191
...these series of qualities
are unique to a woman.

218
00:17:42,191 --> 00:17:45,483
But, you don't even have
 any one of these, you shameless.

219
00:17:45,483 --> 00:17:49,066
It's not you to be blamed,
but your parents.

220
00:17:51,733 --> 00:17:53,066
Why are you disclosing
 in Facebook?

221
00:17:53,066 --> 00:17:54,817
And spoil your name?

222
00:17:54,817 --> 00:17:57,441
Aren't you afraid of
 your future ?

223
00:17:57,441 --> 00:18:00,233
Whom you'll get married
and live peacefully, if you do so?

224
00:18:00,483 --> 00:18:03,316
I can live happily and peacefully.

225
00:18:04,275 --> 00:18:06,942
Because, I'm going to
 get married to you.

226
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,400
If you marry me, not just peace,
you can't live at all.

227
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,775
You'll die...

228
00:18:16,233 --> 00:18:18,400
My parents had fixed
a bride for me.

229
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,483
We got engaged too.

230
00:18:19,483 --> 00:18:23,066
Both families exchange
the plates of betel leaves.

231
00:18:24,191 --> 00:18:26,692
Both of you exchange the garlands.

232
00:18:26,692 --> 00:18:27,900
She is the right match for you.

233
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:29,775
Look at uncle.

234
00:18:31,692 --> 00:18:33,608
He looks funny.

235
00:18:34,441 --> 00:18:35,733
Hello...

236
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:05,233
Who decided the astrological match
 for them?

237
00:19:05,233 --> 00:19:09,358
We checked with an astrologer,
he said that everything matches well.

238
00:19:09,358 --> 00:19:11,567
Jobless people took up
astrology nowadays.

239
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:13,275
That's why, everything goes wrong.

240
00:19:13,275 --> 00:19:14,441
What happened,
Swamy?

241
00:19:14,441 --> 00:19:16,483
This horoscope has Nagadosha.
( A curse of the serpent)

242
00:19:16,483 --> 00:19:18,900
That too, it's intense.

243
00:19:22,984 --> 00:19:26,525
This dosha, affected the bride
as soon as the engagement.

244
00:19:29,525 --> 00:19:30,900
What are you saying?

245
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:33,108
This is your horoscope,
isn't it?

246
00:19:35,275 --> 00:19:39,275
The dosha of your horoscope
killed her.

247
00:19:46,942 --> 00:19:52,817
After the astrologer said that,
 I was taken back.

248
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:56,650
After her death,
I was guilty of myself.

249
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:59,316
Even my friends will ask,

250
00:19:59,316 --> 00:20:01,525
Why I think like a mad?

251
00:20:01,525 --> 00:20:04,441
But, my pain will be felt,
when they're in my stance.

252
00:20:04,441 --> 00:20:08,525
So, you're not going
to get married, henceforth.

253
00:20:08,733 --> 00:20:10,233
No, I didn't mean that.

254
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:14,108
I'll marry a girl
who has the dosha like me.

255
00:20:16,692 --> 00:20:23,775
You know, many people roamed
around me in my school and college days.

256
00:20:23,984 --> 00:20:26,608
Still now, many guys propose me.

257
00:20:27,692 --> 00:20:30,692
I'm not impressed on anyone.

258
00:20:31,316 --> 00:20:34,608
But, I became mad
after seeing you.

259
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:37,942
I just understood
 the reason for that.

260
00:20:38,567 --> 00:20:40,608
I too have the Naga dosha.

261
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:43,692
What are you saying?

262
00:20:43,692 --> 00:20:48,733
That's why, It seems,
I'm roaming around you...

263
00:20:48,733 --> 00:20:51,149
...though you keep ignoring.

264
00:20:51,149 --> 00:20:52,900
Don't worry,

265
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:55,483
We'll live happily ever.

266
00:21:05,032 --> 00:21:11,990
(Indistinct voices)

267
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:14,865
Grandma!

268
00:21:14,865 --> 00:21:16,365
What, dear?

269
00:21:17,698 --> 00:21:18,990
Have you seen him?

270
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:20,407
No, I didn't.

271
00:21:20,407 --> 00:21:22,240
Go and inquire there.

272
00:21:25,282 --> 00:21:26,656
Grandpa!

273
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:28,740
I haven't seen him.

274
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:31,948
Hello,

275
00:21:34,115 --> 00:21:36,032
Do you know him?

276
00:21:38,323 --> 00:21:41,614
Hey dude,
he is our engineer.

277
00:21:41,614 --> 00:21:42,906
Show me.

278
00:21:42,906 --> 00:21:43,906
Yes, dude.

279
00:21:44,948 --> 00:21:47,614
Will you please tell me
 where he is?

280
00:21:47,614 --> 00:21:48,781
I'm searching for him
 for long time.

281
00:21:48,781 --> 00:21:50,198
Come on...

282
00:21:57,614 --> 00:21:58,365
Where?

283
00:21:58,365 --> 00:21:59,740
He is upstairs.

284
00:22:09,865 --> 00:22:10,990
Vikram!

285
00:22:13,282 --> 00:22:14,240
Vikram!

286
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,781
Hey!

287
00:22:15,948 --> 00:22:17,781
Come on...

288
00:22:21,614 --> 00:22:23,157
Vikram!

289
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,032
Vikram!
-Hello...

290
00:22:31,032 --> 00:22:32,115
Hello...

291
00:22:34,282 --> 00:22:36,032
He is here.

292
00:22:43,573 --> 00:22:45,157
He is inside.

293
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:51,781
Vikram!

294
00:23:04,073 --> 00:23:05,740
Where is Vikram?

295
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:10,198
He is Vikram.

296
00:23:10,823 --> 00:23:11,948
No.

297
00:23:13,115 --> 00:23:14,614
Yeah, I'm Vikram.

298
00:23:20,449 --> 00:23:22,282
Listen me.

299
00:23:23,032 --> 00:23:24,490
Don't touch me.

300
00:23:25,198 --> 00:23:28,323
I plead you,
please leave me.

301
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:29,614
Hey, come on...

302
00:23:29,614 --> 00:23:31,948
Come on.

303
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:04,073
Hey...

304
00:24:16,614 --> 00:24:17,240
Oh, no.

305
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:20,449
Vikram!

306
00:24:24,282 --> 00:24:25,781
Don't do too much.

307
00:24:25,781 --> 00:24:27,740
Vikram!

308
00:24:29,032 --> 00:24:31,115
Don't do too much.
 -hey.

309
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:19,698
Still how many people
 will you kill?

310
00:26:19,948 --> 00:26:21,740
Metamorphosing as serpent
 after sunset is your curse.

311
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:26,073
But, you're transforming as serpent
 even if you become furious.

312
00:26:26,073 --> 00:26:29,781
The God who separated him
 from you knows when to unite.

313
00:26:30,115 --> 00:26:31,365
When?

314
00:26:31,365 --> 00:26:33,157
Don't be in hurry.

315
00:26:33,157 --> 00:26:34,407
He'll come in search of you.

316
00:26:35,573 --> 00:26:37,323
That time has come.

317
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,323
Whenever, I ask you say
 the same thing.

318
00:26:40,323 --> 00:26:42,490
You know well,
where he is.

319
00:26:43,365 --> 00:26:45,157
Please, don't hide.

320
00:26:45,531 --> 00:26:47,614
Please, don't hide.
Tell me.

321
00:26:47,614 --> 00:26:48,531
Get up.

322
00:26:48,531 --> 00:26:49,573
Listen me.

323
00:26:49,573 --> 00:26:52,198
Please, don't hide.
Tell me.

324
00:27:47,698 --> 00:27:48,948
Where he is?

325
00:27:49,531 --> 00:27:50,740
Tell me, Swamy.

326
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:51,865
Where he is?

327
00:27:53,282 --> 00:27:55,990
You're hiding something.

328
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:57,698
I don't know the reason.

329
00:27:59,157 --> 00:28:00,614
Oh, Lord Shiva!

330
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:07,740
I'll find out,
wherever he is!

331
00:28:13,656 --> 00:28:16,282
Get the blessings from all.

332
00:28:16,282 --> 00:28:25,490
(Chanting Mantras)

333
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:26,781
No, they'll kill me.

334
00:28:26,781 --> 00:28:29,531
Lord, they must get
 divorced in two months.

335
00:28:29,531 --> 00:28:43,865
(Chanting Mantras)

336
00:30:03,365 --> 00:30:04,490
The snake!

337
00:30:05,115 --> 00:30:06,656
Oh, no...The snake!

338
00:30:06,656 --> 00:30:07,449
The snake!

339
00:30:07,449 --> 00:30:08,573
Anyone come for help!

340
00:30:08,573 --> 00:30:10,365
Oh, no...The snake!

341
00:30:11,032 --> 00:30:11,740
The snake!

342
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:12,990
Oh, no...The snake!

343
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:14,656
Anyone come for help!

344
00:30:14,656 --> 00:30:16,157
The snake!

345
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:19,115
Anyone come for help!
The snake!

346
00:30:20,157 --> 00:30:21,407
The snake!

347
00:30:21,407 --> 00:31:02,614
(Indistinct voices)

348
00:32:14,032 --> 00:32:15,490
The snake!

349
00:32:16,906 --> 00:32:18,365
The snake!

350
00:32:19,573 --> 00:32:20,906
The snake!

351
00:32:22,282 --> 00:32:25,240
Anyone come for help!

352
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,823
The snake!

353
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,449
Sarva!

354
00:32:31,073 --> 00:32:32,781
What happened?

355
00:32:32,781 --> 00:32:34,032
What happened, dear?

356
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,656
What happened?

357
00:32:35,656 --> 00:32:37,073
Where is the snake?

358
00:32:38,073 --> 00:32:41,948
I had a dream like
 a snake is stinging me.

359
00:32:41,948 --> 00:32:43,781
Mom, leave us alone.

360
00:32:43,781 --> 00:32:45,614
You go,
I'll take care.

361
00:32:45,906 --> 00:32:48,656
Okay, let them be alone.
-Yeah, let him take care.

362
00:32:48,656 --> 00:32:49,948
Take care.

363
00:32:51,948 --> 00:32:55,614
Hey, who asked you to sleep
 in the first night?

364
00:32:57,198 --> 00:32:58,823
It's a dream, right?

365
00:32:58,823 --> 00:33:00,698
Leave it, dear.

366
00:33:02,157 --> 00:33:03,490
I'm sorry.

367
00:33:04,032 --> 00:33:05,698
For what?

368
00:33:06,948 --> 00:33:09,906
I lied that I've Naga dosham
 in my horoscope.

369
00:33:09,906 --> 00:33:13,323
To get married to you,
I gave a fake horoscope.

370
00:33:13,323 --> 00:33:15,490
There is no Naga dosha
in my horoscope.

371
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:17,906
Sarva,
I really love you so much.

372
00:33:17,906 --> 00:33:21,323
Though any dosha exists,
it would only affect me.

373
00:33:21,614 --> 00:33:26,365
I decided to live happily with you,
whatever happens.

374
00:33:27,115 --> 00:33:29,073
You're my happiness.

375
00:33:29,531 --> 00:33:31,157
I'm really sorry, Sarva.

376
00:33:31,157 --> 00:33:32,240
Forgive me.

377
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,906
I'm so sorry.

378
00:33:37,698 --> 00:33:39,449
You've done a big mistake.

379
00:33:39,449 --> 00:33:42,407
Why the elders give importance
 for the horoscope?

380
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:45,323
Do you think that
Naga dosha is very simple.

381
00:33:45,323 --> 00:33:49,990
That too, it's intense!
Now, her life is in perils.

382
00:33:54,531 --> 00:33:56,407
Okay, don't be afraid.

383
00:33:56,407 --> 00:34:00,282
By god's grace,
every dosha has a remedy.

384
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:05,032
Tell us, what to do?

385
00:34:05,032 --> 00:34:07,323
In Naganatha Swamy temple
 at Kodaikanal,

386
00:34:07,323 --> 00:34:12,698
A priest named, Anandha Siddhar
will perform a pooja for you...

387
00:34:12,698 --> 00:34:15,407
...if you refer my name.

388
00:34:17,781 --> 00:34:19,531
Then, an important information.

389
00:34:19,865 --> 00:34:23,865
You must avoid intimacy,
till this pooja gets over.

390
00:34:50,990 --> 00:34:53,157
Swamy,
I left angrily on that day.

391
00:34:53,157 --> 00:34:55,198
Who takes care
other than you?

392
00:34:58,906 --> 00:35:01,656
I can't be idle
without searching him?

393
00:35:03,198 --> 00:35:08,531
Leading the life as a woman at day
 and serpent at night is horrible.

394
00:35:09,573 --> 00:35:14,032
I bear everything with belief
that I'll get to him.

395
00:35:14,032 --> 00:35:14,906
Everything is your fate.

396
00:35:14,906 --> 00:35:19,032
Why the fate which you mention,
 makes me to suffer?

397
00:35:19,032 --> 00:35:22,656
Each and every living being
 in this world, has to face this fate.

398
00:35:22,656 --> 00:35:25,073
As humans can speak,…

399
00:35:25,073 --> 00:35:27,407
…they named it as,"Fate"
and are blabbering.

400
00:35:27,781 --> 00:35:34,032
If the fate has a form,
everyone will be furious to kill that.

401
00:35:34,865 --> 00:35:37,490
If this fate,
decides to destroy someone...

402
00:35:37,490 --> 00:35:40,115
Even the traitor can't do his worst.

403
00:35:40,781 --> 00:35:42,614
The same fate,
if decides to give...

404
00:35:42,614 --> 00:35:44,740
Even the god can't do his best.

405
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:48,365
Even the atheist,

406
00:35:48,365 --> 00:35:50,614
if he looks keen at his life,

407
00:35:50,614 --> 00:35:52,531
He'll feel the fate.

408
00:35:52,531 --> 00:35:56,823
Swamy, has anyone in this world
 suffered like me?

409
00:35:56,990 --> 00:36:00,781
Will anyone believe,
if happened so?

410
00:36:00,948 --> 00:36:02,823
Fate has no grammar.

411
00:36:02,823 --> 00:36:05,365
Nothing will happen to believe
and as desired.

412
00:36:05,531 --> 00:36:07,531
Only by experience,
 this can be felt.

413
00:36:07,531 --> 00:36:11,573
Yeah Swamy,
when will I see him?

414
00:36:44,365 --> 00:36:48,157
As I said earlier,
he is coming here.

415
00:36:57,490 --> 00:36:58,449
But, one thing.

416
00:36:58,449 --> 00:36:59,614
What's that, Swamy?

417
00:37:01,198 --> 00:37:02,948
He got married.

418
00:37:04,490 --> 00:37:06,490
He is coming with his wife.

419
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:07,865
You mean, wife?

420
00:37:09,365 --> 00:37:10,449
Then, who am I?

421
00:37:10,449 --> 00:37:11,865
That's the past.

422
00:37:11,865 --> 00:37:17,032
When I'm alive,
how can that be the past?

423
00:37:17,032 --> 00:37:19,240
Can you live with him?

424
00:37:19,407 --> 00:37:20,906
Think over yourself.

425
00:37:21,198 --> 00:37:23,365
He is the reason for this stance.

426
00:37:23,365 --> 00:37:25,032
You think over.

427
00:37:26,282 --> 00:37:28,740
It's good to forget him.
That's the dharma.

428
00:37:28,948 --> 00:37:33,531
I lived like a princess,
with people who served me.

429
00:37:34,573 --> 00:37:41,157
But, now with his thoughts,
I'm wandering in the house, forest and bushes.

430
00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:44,865
When asked,
you say it's fate...fate...

431
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:49,282
Should this fate play with me?

432
00:37:50,531 --> 00:37:51,656
I'll show.

433
00:37:51,656 --> 00:37:54,948
I'll show this fate,
 who am I?

434
00:38:04,323 --> 00:38:09,157
You're aware about his marriage
and hid to me.

435
00:38:09,157 --> 00:38:11,365
Now, you ask me to forget him
 and say that's the dharma.

436
00:38:11,365 --> 00:38:12,614
What's that dharma?

437
00:38:13,823 --> 00:38:16,115
Nagarani...

438
00:39:42,823 --> 00:39:46,073
Hey, seen the mist?
Look there, it's nice.

439
00:39:47,073 --> 00:39:50,157
Awesome!
it's superb.

440
00:39:53,115 --> 00:39:54,906
Come on,
let's go inside.

441
00:41:55,008 --> 00:41:56,133
Hey, you?

442
00:41:56,133 --> 00:41:57,382
Is it you?

443
00:41:57,382 --> 00:41:58,966
Come inside...

444
00:42:01,674 --> 00:42:05,883
You said that I'm your wife
 in all your births.

445
00:42:06,841 --> 00:42:08,674
You still remember that?

446
00:42:08,674 --> 00:42:11,216
Shouldn't we both live
happily together?

447
00:42:13,049 --> 00:42:15,257
Hey, who is she!

448
00:42:16,049 --> 00:42:17,591
What are you doing here?

449
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:19,424
Who are you?

450
00:42:19,424 --> 00:42:20,883
I'm asking you,
tell me.

451
00:42:24,216 --> 00:42:25,632
Forget him, henceforth.

452
00:42:25,632 --> 00:42:26,507
I'll kill you.

453
00:42:41,216 --> 00:42:42,299
Who?

454
00:42:42,966 --> 00:42:44,008
Vikram!

455
00:42:44,674 --> 00:42:45,507
I don't know.

456
00:42:45,507 --> 00:42:46,299
Ask in the reception.

457
00:42:46,299 --> 00:42:48,175
-Sarva!
I'm coming.

458
00:43:03,382 --> 00:43:05,924
You'll be flat within ten minutes
 of taking this.

459
00:43:05,924 --> 00:43:08,799
Then, wonder at my performance.

460
00:43:08,799 --> 00:43:10,966
Good, no one is here.

461
00:43:11,382 --> 00:43:12,674
I'll go.

462
00:43:14,966 --> 00:43:15,841
Madam!

463
00:43:18,716 --> 00:43:19,591
Madam!

464
00:43:19,674 --> 00:43:23,133
The boy isn't there,
 that's why I came.

465
00:43:37,133 --> 00:43:41,799
Madam, you're faster than me.

466
00:43:43,133 --> 00:43:44,466
Bye, madam.

467
00:43:45,591 --> 00:43:47,299
Kalyanam, you're the luckiest.

468
00:43:47,299 --> 00:43:48,133
Yeah!

469
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:03,799
No one has seen.

470
00:44:03,799 --> 00:44:06,799
If so, no one will doubt
 as I'm the manager.

471
00:44:16,716 --> 00:44:19,216
Oh, is this how it goes?

472
00:44:19,216 --> 00:44:20,549
He is not suppressing.

473
00:44:20,632 --> 00:44:23,632
Oh, no...she is killing me
even after coming for honeymoon.

474
00:44:25,841 --> 00:44:28,674
What a beautiful legs!

475
00:44:28,674 --> 00:44:30,674
You've put down these legs!

476
00:44:30,674 --> 00:44:34,883
I've fallen on many legs,
I can fall many times for this leg.

477
00:44:38,382 --> 00:44:41,507
The leg must be like this.

478
00:44:41,507 --> 00:44:43,216
How fair it is!

479
00:44:43,216 --> 00:44:45,966
Oh, no...

480
00:44:45,966 --> 00:44:49,841
Is it for me...?

481
00:44:49,841 --> 00:44:54,841
Is all these for me...?

482
00:44:54,841 --> 00:44:57,382
I feel shy, Kalyanam.

483
00:44:57,549 --> 00:44:58,674
Sorry, darling.

484
00:44:58,758 --> 00:45:00,758
I'm going to rape you, now.

485
00:45:03,883 --> 00:45:05,591
I feel ticklish.

486
00:45:07,424 --> 00:45:09,008
She looks fair!

487
00:45:09,008 --> 00:45:12,008
Glowing like gold!

488
00:45:13,008 --> 00:45:15,299
Her forehead is the silver moon!

489
00:45:15,299 --> 00:45:18,758
Her physique is the diamond mine!

490
00:45:18,758 --> 00:45:20,340
Golden mountain!

491
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:23,257
A statue made of gold!

492
00:45:23,257 --> 00:45:25,340
Is it a dream or real?

493
00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:27,549
Goof, look at the job
you're here for.

494
00:45:27,549 --> 00:45:30,216
Instead, thinking whether
 it's dream or real?

495
00:45:30,216 --> 00:45:33,091
Oh, no...is this the hands?

496
00:45:33,091 --> 00:45:36,424
It's so smooth as plaintain stem.

497
00:45:36,424 --> 00:45:39,466
I'm going to slip,
when I touch,

498
00:45:39,466 --> 00:45:41,257
You're gifted!

499
00:45:41,257 --> 00:45:46,966
Being unconscious,
Are you asking for kiss?

500
00:45:46,966 --> 00:45:50,175
As you wish,
 I'll start from the kiss.

501
00:45:52,008 --> 00:45:57,507
Hey, snake...
-Hey, come on...

502
00:45:57,507 --> 00:45:59,466
Madam, are you a snake?

503
00:45:59,466 --> 00:46:00,674
Can't you see?

504
00:46:00,674 --> 00:46:01,591
Sorry, madam.

505
00:46:01,591 --> 00:46:05,966
(A musical line from movie "VIKRAM")

506
00:46:05,966 --> 00:46:08,507
Hey, first switch off the phone.

507
00:46:08,507 --> 00:46:10,632
Annoying ringtone.

508
00:46:10,632 --> 00:46:12,799
(A musical line from movie "VIKRAM")

509
00:46:12,799 --> 00:46:13,632
I switched it off, madam.

510
00:46:13,632 --> 00:46:16,424
If you reveal what happened here,
I'll finish you off.

511
00:46:16,424 --> 00:46:19,340
The snake says punch dialogue!

512
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:21,216
Shall I leave then, snake madam?

513
00:46:21,216 --> 00:46:22,382
Get lost.

514
00:46:22,382 --> 00:46:24,091
Thank you, snake madam.

515
00:46:24,924 --> 00:46:25,883
I'm leaving.

516
00:46:28,340 --> 00:46:30,549
She says, she'll finish off me.

517
00:46:30,549 --> 00:46:33,340
Who'll believe if I say,
that a girl has transformed to snake?

518
00:46:36,091 --> 00:46:38,216
Hey, where did you go?

519
00:46:38,216 --> 00:46:39,799
I saw you going last night.

520
00:46:39,799 --> 00:46:42,216
I went throughout the night.

521
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:44,632
When did you see me?

522
00:46:44,632 --> 00:46:46,883
You went the whole night?

523
00:46:46,883 --> 00:46:48,924
That's why, you're looking tired.

524
00:46:48,924 --> 00:46:51,674
I know, when you took the milk.

525
00:46:51,674 --> 00:46:54,175
Oh, is that?

526
00:46:54,175 --> 00:46:57,175
Then, will I get fruit salad
 for the snake?

527
00:46:57,175 --> 00:46:59,299
You saw me taking the milk.

528
00:46:59,299 --> 00:47:01,008
Did you see me coming out?

529
00:47:01,008 --> 00:47:02,424
Yes, I saw that too.

530
00:47:02,424 --> 00:47:05,008
I know, when you offered
her a free room.

531
00:47:05,008 --> 00:47:06,883
You're a fraud.

532
00:47:06,883 --> 00:47:08,424
Did you see what happened inside?

533
00:47:08,424 --> 00:47:10,924
No...I'm not that kind of person.

534
00:47:10,924 --> 00:47:12,799
You got caught!

535
00:47:12,799 --> 00:47:15,299
Will you go today?

536
00:47:15,299 --> 00:47:17,507
She is inside.

537
00:47:17,507 --> 00:47:19,466
Is she inside?
- Oh...

538
00:47:19,466 --> 00:47:22,841
Hey, she'll set right
 only after the sunset.

539
00:47:22,841 --> 00:47:25,299
Get in after the sunsets.

540
00:47:25,299 --> 00:47:26,924
She'll immediately be okay.

541
00:47:26,924 --> 00:47:29,758
I'll finish her, today.

542
00:47:30,674 --> 00:47:34,466
Madam, you're a beautiful demon.

543
00:47:34,466 --> 00:47:36,049
You look so beautiful!

544
00:47:36,049 --> 00:47:41,841
If I've met you earlier,
 I haven't married the devil, my wife.

545
00:47:41,841 --> 00:47:44,716
He feels similar to me.

546
00:47:44,716 --> 00:47:48,216
Madam, why are your hands changing?
-Have you seen?

547
00:47:48,216 --> 00:47:50,924
Madam, you're transforming
 as a snake!

548
00:47:50,924 --> 00:47:53,299
Oh, no...
Snake!

549
00:47:53,299 --> 00:47:57,841
Save me.

550
00:47:57,841 --> 00:48:00,133
Snake!

551
00:48:06,175 --> 00:48:09,466
Will you have desires,
hereafter?

552
00:48:11,966 --> 00:48:13,216
Why can't we do like this?

553
00:48:13,216 --> 00:48:13,924
How?

554
00:48:13,924 --> 00:48:15,591
If we ask for a promise
that it shouldn't sting...

555
00:48:15,591 --> 00:48:17,133
...then it won't breach.

556
00:48:17,133 --> 00:48:18,133
Yeah.

557
00:48:18,299 --> 00:48:19,175
Why that now?

558
00:48:19,175 --> 00:48:21,340
It's good to get
a promise from it.

559
00:48:21,424 --> 00:48:22,883
Get a promise?

560
00:48:22,883 --> 00:48:25,257
It'll transform as
 a snake only after sunset.

561
00:48:25,257 --> 00:48:27,175
If we go before that...

562
00:48:27,175 --> 00:48:28,549
What do you say?

563
00:48:29,841 --> 00:48:31,549
Who are you?

564
00:48:31,549 --> 00:48:33,674
Where are you from?

565
00:49:17,091 --> 00:49:20,966
Swamy, if he doesn't remember me?

566
00:49:21,008 --> 00:49:22,758
Yeah, there are chances for that too.

567
00:49:22,841 --> 00:49:26,133
If he doesn't remember you,
don't worry.

568
00:49:26,841 --> 00:49:33,175
If you provoke his feelings,
he'll definitely recall the memories.

569
00:50:00,966 --> 00:50:17,175
"Saiya...Saiya..."

570
00:50:17,175 --> 00:50:25,133
"Nakula...Nakula..."
"Shall I melt on your shoulders?"

571
00:50:25,133 --> 00:50:31,966
"Mukila...Mukila..."
"Shall I freeze along with you?"

572
00:50:31,966 --> 00:50:35,049
"Shall I search for you
in my eyes?"

573
00:50:35,049 --> 00:50:36,841
"Shall I search...?"

574
00:50:36,841 --> 00:50:39,966
"Pop up to pilfer my love..."

575
00:50:39,966 --> 00:50:44,924
"Just a second is enough...
 It's enough..."

576
00:50:44,924 --> 00:50:49,674
"To mingle with me..."

577
00:50:49,674 --> 00:50:52,841
"Oh, no!
When the pace elevates"

578
00:50:52,841 --> 00:50:57,175
"My hormones are sighing
 to tell tales..."

579
00:50:57,175 --> 00:51:00,716
"Somewhere the clouds
merge each other..."

580
00:51:00,716 --> 00:51:05,091
"Immediately the drizzles caress..."

581
00:51:05,091 --> 00:51:11,841
"The time has come stricken..."

582
00:51:47,382 --> 00:51:51,340
"My dear...oh,my dear..."

583
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:55,466
"If both our lips are locked
my fasting will get over "

584
00:51:55,466 --> 00:51:59,382
"This moment will stop"

585
00:51:59,382 --> 00:52:03,841
"The space must reduce,
 The eyelids must close"

586
00:52:03,841 --> 00:52:05,799
"Shall I tie you as kattamaran?"

587
00:52:05,799 --> 00:52:07,841
"I don't have any plans
 to let you..."

588
00:52:07,841 --> 00:52:11,883
"Buried in lap...lie seduced...
My mind swings away..."

589
00:52:11,883 --> 00:52:13,883
"Touching like a silk thread..."

590
00:52:13,883 --> 00:52:15,841
"The kisses mount up
 like a small mountain"

591
00:52:15,841 --> 00:52:17,924
"When the moon disappears,
 the fingers twine."

592
00:52:17,924 --> 00:52:19,924
"Rapidity of the nerves raise..."

593
00:52:19,924 --> 00:52:27,883
"My life...will it conjoin with you?"

594
00:52:27,883 --> 00:52:34,424
"The time has come stricken..."

595
00:52:46,133 --> 00:52:50,091
"Is this a wild flower?"

596
00:52:50,091 --> 00:52:53,841
"Has the lord Kama
 tasted the spirit?"

597
00:52:53,841 --> 00:52:58,257
"Oh, the breath..."

598
00:52:58,257 --> 00:53:02,049
"Getting hot when it touched..."

599
00:53:02,049 --> 00:53:06,133
"Get buried in my chest...
Get freezed in my soul..."

600
00:53:06,133 --> 00:53:07,799
"The way to ecstasy...."

601
00:53:07,799 --> 00:53:10,008
"You...search it..."

602
00:53:10,008 --> 00:53:14,091
"Getting lost to me...
Getting seduced to you..."

603
00:53:14,091 --> 00:53:15,841
"As the attire in between..."

604
00:53:15,841 --> 00:53:17,841
"You...change so..."

605
00:53:17,841 --> 00:53:25,716
"My life...will conjoin with you..."

606
00:53:25,716 --> 00:53:32,382
"The time has come stricken..."

607
00:53:33,883 --> 00:53:57,549
"Saiya...Saiya..."

608
00:53:57,549 --> 00:53:58,133
Oh, no...

609
00:53:58,716 --> 00:54:00,507
Before the dosha remedy,
 if we be intimate...

610
00:54:00,507 --> 00:54:01,883
...that'll be endangering
 to your life, isn't it?

611
00:54:01,883 --> 00:54:03,674
I too behaved madly.

612
00:54:06,758 --> 00:54:08,257
The astrologer told me everything.

613
00:54:08,257 --> 00:54:11,008
It's a full moon day
on coming Friday.

614
00:54:11,799 --> 00:54:14,591
If you do the remedy on that day,
 you'll be relieved on the whole.

615
00:54:15,091 --> 00:54:16,257
Come on that day.

616
00:54:17,966 --> 00:54:19,674
We're leaving, Swamy.

617
00:54:24,924 --> 00:54:30,257
In your entire life, every moment
will burden you with his thoughts.

618
00:54:30,257 --> 00:54:31,841
That's my curse!

619
00:55:48,841 --> 00:55:50,632
Yeah, tell me.

620
00:55:51,591 --> 00:55:54,008
We're not here for honeymoon.

621
00:55:54,008 --> 00:55:56,216
We've come for some other work.
 You know that.

622
00:55:59,216 --> 00:56:00,591
When did she come?

623
00:56:02,716 --> 00:56:03,591
Oh..

624
00:56:04,008 --> 00:56:05,049
Okay.

625
00:56:07,799 --> 00:56:08,424
Okay.

626
00:56:09,091 --> 00:56:11,133
Always busy with the phone.
 -okay.

627
00:56:12,966 --> 00:56:15,049
Hey, what are you doing?

628
00:56:15,340 --> 00:56:16,966
Hey, don't do like this.

629
00:56:18,257 --> 00:56:20,424
Hey,
-no...

630
00:56:22,216 --> 00:56:22,799
Be quiet.

631
00:56:22,799 --> 00:56:24,924
Just a kiss.
 -what're you doing?

632
00:56:25,507 --> 00:56:27,591
See, what I'm going to do today?

633
00:56:36,424 --> 00:56:37,507
Hey, snake!

634
00:56:39,382 --> 00:56:40,466
Hey, go...

635
00:56:42,799 --> 00:56:43,841
Sarva!

636
00:56:43,966 --> 00:56:44,841
Snake!

637
00:56:45,091 --> 00:56:46,382
Someone come for help!

638
00:56:47,340 --> 00:56:48,299
Wait, don't get afraid.

639
00:56:48,299 --> 00:56:50,507
Where is the snake?
 -brother.

640
00:56:51,632 --> 00:56:52,799
Sarva!

641
00:57:22,966 --> 00:57:26,257
I've never seen such
a big serpent in my life.

642
00:57:26,257 --> 00:57:27,758
I'm very much afraid, Swamy.

643
00:57:27,758 --> 00:57:29,216
Don't be afraid.

644
00:57:31,591 --> 00:57:33,549
Tomorrow is the full moon day.

645
00:57:34,008 --> 00:57:36,632
As I said, do the remedy.

646
00:57:55,758 --> 00:57:57,716
Swamy, nothing will happen
 to her by that time, isn't it?

647
00:57:57,716 --> 00:57:58,883
Don't worry.

648
00:57:59,716 --> 00:58:01,175
God is there.

649
00:58:02,091 --> 00:58:05,175
No spirit can do anything.

650
00:58:21,091 --> 00:58:24,257
I'll show who this Nagarani is!

651
00:58:30,420 --> 00:58:32,546
This is why,
 I'm not conveying you anything.

652
00:58:32,546 --> 00:58:34,045
Don't be afraid, mom.

653
00:58:34,045 --> 00:58:36,295
I'm fine.

654
00:58:36,754 --> 00:58:38,212
Just now he went out.

655
00:58:38,212 --> 00:58:39,671
He'll come back,
mom.

656
00:58:41,921 --> 00:58:45,004
Don't worry unnecessarily.

657
00:59:07,712 --> 00:59:10,170
The snake!

658
00:59:12,879 --> 00:59:14,004
The Snake!

659
00:59:16,337 --> 00:59:18,128
Sarva!

660
00:59:18,796 --> 00:59:19,921
Sarva!

661
00:59:40,546 --> 00:59:42,004
Sarva!

662
00:59:42,337 --> 00:59:44,212
Someone help!

663
00:59:44,420 --> 00:59:45,712
The snake!

664
01:00:05,254 --> 01:00:09,963
Drag it.

665
01:00:09,963 --> 01:00:11,170
Be careful.

666
01:00:11,546 --> 01:00:13,128
Don't leave.
Drag it.

667
01:00:13,128 --> 01:00:14,462
Be careful.

668
01:00:14,462 --> 01:00:15,546
Sarva!

669
01:00:15,546 --> 01:00:17,087
Drag it!

670
01:00:17,546 --> 01:00:18,546
Drag it!

671
01:00:19,045 --> 01:00:19,963
Don't leave.

672
01:00:19,963 --> 01:00:21,254
Don't leave.

673
01:00:22,087 --> 01:00:22,671
Drag it.

674
01:00:22,671 --> 01:00:24,254
Oh no, Sarva!

675
01:00:24,254 --> 01:00:25,045
Be careful.

676
01:00:25,963 --> 01:00:30,837
I've never seen such a
 furious snake in my life.

677
01:00:30,837 --> 01:00:32,087
Be careful.

678
01:00:38,212 --> 01:00:39,546
Nothing...

679
01:01:54,420 --> 01:01:57,087
Few years ago.

680
01:01:58,879 --> 01:02:00,295
Happy Bus day!

681
01:02:13,629 --> 01:02:15,379
Take the cake.
-No, I don't want.

682
01:02:15,462 --> 01:02:16,754
I don't like.
-Have it.

683
01:02:16,754 --> 01:02:18,796
Take now.
-No.

684
01:02:18,796 --> 01:02:21,128
Just leave, if she doesn't like.
Give in front.

685
01:02:21,128 --> 01:02:22,337
You go.

686
01:02:23,004 --> 01:02:25,420
Won't you celebrate "Bus day"
in your college?

687
01:02:25,420 --> 01:02:27,921
We'll celebrate, boss.
Give to those at front.

688
01:02:27,921 --> 01:02:28,879
You take it.

689
01:02:29,504 --> 01:02:31,254
Take it.

690
01:02:32,087 --> 01:02:33,879
Why should we brawl
among ourselves?

691
01:02:33,879 --> 01:02:34,587
Go away.

692
01:02:34,587 --> 01:02:36,337
Will you hit me?

693
01:02:36,462 --> 01:02:38,212
Hit me.
-we're telling you.

694
01:02:38,212 --> 01:02:39,462
Hold this.

695
01:02:52,128 --> 01:02:53,379
Hit me.

696
01:02:54,754 --> 01:02:56,629
Hit me.
What are you looking at?

697
01:03:20,045 --> 01:03:21,629
Do you know who am I?

698
01:04:20,170 --> 01:04:22,462
No one has touched me
so far.

699
01:04:22,462 --> 01:04:22,879
Dude.

700
01:04:22,879 --> 01:04:24,963
But, he had hit me.

701
01:04:25,462 --> 01:04:29,462
I expected that you'll thrash him,
Instead you flee.

702
01:04:29,921 --> 01:04:31,462
Don't worry, dude.

703
01:04:31,462 --> 01:04:34,712
We'll ask Jayanthpuram Marudhu
to behead him.

704
01:04:34,712 --> 01:04:36,671
Why to expect Marudhu?

705
01:04:37,212 --> 01:04:41,921
I'll go to his college tomorrow
 and behead him.

706
01:04:43,045 --> 01:04:46,128
Don't ever study.
Always get notes from me.

707
01:04:47,879 --> 01:04:48,754
What?

708
01:04:48,879 --> 01:04:49,587
What happened?

709
01:04:49,587 --> 01:04:50,504
Why are you hiding?

710
01:04:50,504 --> 01:04:51,754
What happened?
-don't talk.

711
01:04:53,128 --> 01:04:54,879
Hey, superb!

712
01:04:55,420 --> 01:04:56,587
Superb!

713
01:04:56,587 --> 01:04:59,337
Dude, the one who hit us
in the bus has come to our college.

714
01:04:59,337 --> 01:05:00,629
What are you saying?

715
01:05:11,921 --> 01:05:13,879
He is a dead meat, today.

716
01:05:13,879 --> 01:05:16,504
Search for him, everywhere.
-Okay, dude.

717
01:05:18,712 --> 01:05:19,754
Hey, look there.

718
01:05:19,754 --> 01:05:20,128
Go and see.

719
01:05:20,128 --> 01:05:21,170
Dude, he is not here.

720
01:05:28,087 --> 01:05:29,379
Don't leave him.

721
01:05:30,004 --> 01:05:31,337
He is not here.

722
01:05:45,087 --> 01:05:46,629
Come on.
-Clear out.

723
01:05:48,045 --> 01:05:48,963
Hurry up.

724
01:05:49,796 --> 01:05:51,004
How did you come here?

725
01:05:51,337 --> 01:05:52,629
Just to see you.

726
01:05:52,963 --> 01:05:55,212
What are you saying
in everyone's presence?

727
01:05:55,212 --> 01:05:56,295
What's there in it?

728
01:05:56,295 --> 01:05:57,212
Go...

729
01:05:57,796 --> 01:05:58,837
I told you to go.

730
01:05:58,837 --> 01:06:00,254
Where to go?

731
01:06:00,837 --> 01:06:01,712
Hey.

732
01:06:03,170 --> 01:06:04,754
See there.

733
01:06:11,045 --> 01:06:13,170
Has the guy who fought yesterday
 in the bus came here?

734
01:06:15,212 --> 01:06:16,087
Tell us.

735
01:06:16,212 --> 01:06:17,504
No, he didn't...

736
01:06:17,504 --> 01:06:18,963
He shouldn't leave the college today.

737
01:06:18,963 --> 01:06:20,128
Close the main gate.
 -okay.

738
01:06:20,128 --> 01:06:21,128
Come...
 -come...

739
01:06:24,712 --> 01:06:25,671
Go...

740
01:06:25,671 --> 01:06:27,671
They didn't leave yet. Get in.
 -go fast...

741
01:06:30,045 --> 01:06:31,462
Where are you taking me?

742
01:06:38,921 --> 01:06:41,295
Clear out.
-Go away.

743
01:06:53,045 --> 01:06:54,462
Oh, no...
they're coming.

744
01:06:57,754 --> 01:06:59,212
Hey, hurry up.

745
01:07:02,128 --> 01:07:05,170
Don't let him to escape.

746
01:07:13,754 --> 01:07:14,796
They're coming...

747
01:07:14,796 --> 01:07:16,379
Hold now.
They're coming...

748
01:07:17,045 --> 01:07:18,170
That's it.

749
01:07:18,504 --> 01:07:20,462
You won't be afraid of them.

750
01:07:22,045 --> 01:07:23,295
You came for this, right?

751
01:07:24,337 --> 01:07:25,254
Leave now.

752
01:07:29,546 --> 01:07:30,462
I love you.

753
01:07:32,045 --> 01:07:34,837
Do you want to be alive or not?

754
01:07:43,754 --> 01:07:44,462
Okay, brother.

755
01:07:44,754 --> 01:07:45,796
Thrash it.

756
01:07:45,796 --> 01:07:46,128
Break it.

757
01:07:46,128 --> 01:07:47,379
Break the tape recorder.

758
01:07:47,379 --> 01:07:50,629
Hey, break the tape recorder.
 -don't hit us, brother.

759
01:07:50,629 --> 01:07:52,837
Thrash everything.
-Don't damage.

760
01:07:52,837 --> 01:07:55,921
Break their limbs.

761
01:07:55,921 --> 01:07:57,004
To whom?

762
01:07:57,004 --> 01:07:58,379
What are you thinking about us?

763
01:07:58,379 --> 01:07:59,546
Mom, you go that side.
 -hit them.

764
01:07:59,546 --> 01:08:00,546
Hit him.

765
01:08:00,546 --> 01:08:02,379
Hit him. His shop shoudn't be there.
 -hit him...

766
01:08:02,379 --> 01:08:03,254
Smash them.

767
01:08:03,254 --> 01:08:05,420
We shoudn't see his face
 again in this locale.

768
01:08:05,420 --> 01:08:07,045
This shop shouldn't be here.

769
01:08:09,170 --> 01:08:10,587
Why did you come here?

770
01:08:10,587 --> 01:08:11,796
To meet you.

771
01:08:11,796 --> 01:08:14,212
Leave from here.

772
01:08:14,212 --> 01:08:16,045
Why are you asking me to leave?

773
01:08:16,045 --> 01:08:18,004
Don't play without knowing
 the problem.

774
01:08:18,379 --> 01:08:19,420
Go away from here.

775
01:08:19,629 --> 01:08:21,671
Tell me, "I love you"
I'll leave then.

776
01:08:21,879 --> 01:08:22,712
Tell me.

777
01:08:22,712 --> 01:08:24,671
Who are you?
-grandma.

778
01:08:25,045 --> 01:08:27,337
I'm asking you,
Who are you?

779
01:08:27,337 --> 01:08:29,379
Is there a gas stove
in your home?

780
01:08:29,671 --> 01:08:31,295
Yes...but, why?

781
01:08:31,504 --> 01:08:34,837
I've a product
to save the fuel.

782
01:08:34,837 --> 01:08:37,004
It's a fraud company,
isn't it?

783
01:08:37,504 --> 01:08:39,420
What you say
is a different company.

784
01:08:39,420 --> 01:08:40,963
It's a branded one.

785
01:08:41,128 --> 01:08:43,128
 Branded one?

786
01:08:43,128 --> 01:08:45,045
Then, it's good.

787
01:08:45,045 --> 01:08:45,921
Yes, grandma.

788
01:08:45,921 --> 01:08:48,420
If you show me the kitchen,
 I'll install it.

789
01:08:48,671 --> 01:08:50,754
Come, I'll show...

790
01:08:50,754 --> 01:08:52,963
Hey, you get inside.
-Go...

791
01:08:55,879 --> 01:08:57,254
Will you leave me?

792
01:08:57,254 --> 01:08:58,128
Grandma.

793
01:08:58,128 --> 01:08:59,629
Come inside.

794
01:09:01,921 --> 01:09:03,546
It's very simple,
grandma.

795
01:09:06,921 --> 01:09:08,212
How is it?

796
01:09:08,212 --> 01:09:11,420
Wow! good density of flame!

797
01:09:11,420 --> 01:09:13,587
Yeah, it's a good company.

798
01:09:19,254 --> 01:09:21,796
Grandma,
why it's crowded outside?

799
01:09:21,796 --> 01:09:23,212
That is...

800
01:09:23,462 --> 01:09:28,921
The guy in the opposite cycle shop
was teasing my grand daughter...

801
01:09:28,921 --> 01:09:30,796
... playing the songs,
whenever she crosses.

802
01:09:30,796 --> 01:09:33,087
I told my younger son.

803
01:09:33,087 --> 01:09:36,504
 He brought few people
and thrashed the shop.

804
01:09:36,629 --> 01:09:38,379
What's that song, grandma?

805
01:09:38,379 --> 01:09:43,045
Dear, what's that song
 where the word,"floret" is stretched?

806
01:09:43,045 --> 01:09:45,004
Grandma, can't you keep quiet?

807
01:09:45,004 --> 01:09:47,837
She won't allow me to say.
-"Oh floret..."

808
01:09:48,587 --> 01:09:50,837
"Why this silence...?"

809
01:09:51,045 --> 01:09:51,671
Be quiet.

810
01:09:51,671 --> 01:09:54,504
"Why this silence...?"
-hey, stop it.

811
01:09:54,504 --> 01:09:56,754
You too sing the same.

812
01:09:57,004 --> 01:09:58,128
How much?

813
01:09:58,295 --> 01:10:00,128
It's okay, grandma.

814
01:10:00,128 --> 01:10:01,879
You are a sales person, right?

815
01:10:01,879 --> 01:10:02,921
Yeah, grandma.

816
01:10:02,921 --> 01:10:06,420
But, you look similar
to my maternal grandma.

817
01:10:06,587 --> 01:10:08,212
So, let it be a free service.

818
01:10:08,754 --> 01:10:11,337
You're an innocent.

819
01:10:11,337 --> 01:10:12,879
Take this ten rupees.

820
01:10:12,879 --> 01:10:16,462
Give this money in home
 instead spending unnecessarily.

821
01:10:16,462 --> 01:10:17,712
Okay, grandma.

822
01:10:18,045 --> 01:10:21,212
You too don't spend lavishly.
Keep it safe.

823
01:10:22,420 --> 01:10:23,420
Dude, just a minute.

824
01:10:23,420 --> 01:10:24,170
Who are you?

825
01:10:24,170 --> 01:10:26,671
He is from the gas company.

826
01:10:27,462 --> 01:10:28,712
Okay, go.

827
01:10:30,295 --> 01:10:32,170
Dude, where are you from?

828
01:10:32,796 --> 01:10:33,879
Goripalayam.

829
01:10:51,963 --> 01:10:52,963
Then?

830
01:10:53,045 --> 01:10:54,420
Hey, your beau is waiting.

831
01:10:57,921 --> 01:10:59,295
Be quiet.

832
01:11:00,170 --> 01:11:02,963
Okay, I'll leave as my beau
will be waiting.

833
01:11:05,629 --> 01:11:06,546
Thank you.

834
01:11:08,754 --> 01:11:10,546
Don't you know that
 I'm your beau...

835
01:11:10,546 --> 01:11:11,629
...when all your friends know?

836
01:11:12,537 --> 01:11:15,579
Don't you've a desire to get married
and stay with a family?

837
01:11:15,579 --> 01:11:17,079
That's why,
 I came to meet you.

838
01:11:17,079 --> 01:11:18,079
They'll kill you.

839
01:11:18,079 --> 01:11:19,579
Do you know,
 who is my father?

840
01:11:19,745 --> 01:11:20,995
Your native place is Sivagangai.

841
01:11:20,995 --> 01:11:22,663
Your father is the head
 of Palaiyampatti.

842
01:11:22,663 --> 01:11:26,079
He is the police station and
 the court of the surrounding villages.

843
01:11:26,079 --> 01:11:28,246
More honour killings
has occurred there...

844
01:11:28,246 --> 01:11:29,745
 ...and your father is the reason.

845
01:11:29,745 --> 01:11:31,329
Do you love me
after knowing everything?

846
01:11:31,412 --> 01:11:32,995
I fell in love
when not aware of these.

847
01:11:32,995 --> 01:11:35,579
Now, it's known.
Can I leave you for that sake?

848
01:11:35,828 --> 01:11:39,162
Even the animals can't fall in love,
 if there is no restraint.

849
01:11:39,329 --> 01:11:42,870
The happiness when I saw,
 I never felt so far.

850
01:11:42,954 --> 01:11:45,579
I wish this happiness
 ever stay in my life.

851
01:11:45,870 --> 01:11:47,204
What are you saying?

852
01:11:48,663 --> 01:11:51,246
Hey, Malar...

853
01:11:51,246 --> 01:11:52,828
Stop there.

854
01:11:55,454 --> 01:11:57,037
Thrash him.
-Stop there.

855
01:11:58,287 --> 01:12:00,037
No, Vikram.

856
01:12:00,246 --> 01:12:01,496
Leave my hand.

857
01:12:01,496 --> 01:12:01,995
Vikram...

858
01:13:18,912 --> 01:13:20,037
Hey, stop there.

859
01:13:20,371 --> 01:13:22,371
Don't come behind me.
 Go.

860
01:13:22,371 --> 01:13:25,037
I'm asking you to stop,
but you keep going.

861
01:13:25,745 --> 01:13:28,621
I said a lot to you,
but you went.

862
01:13:28,621 --> 01:13:30,246
Are you so courageous?

863
01:13:30,246 --> 01:13:31,870
Then, if a problem happens
before me,

864
01:13:31,870 --> 01:13:33,329
Should I remain silent?

865
01:13:33,329 --> 01:13:35,745
If I didn't go, they would've
 killed that cop...

866
01:13:35,870 --> 01:13:36,995
If you had died?

867
01:13:36,995 --> 01:13:39,120
I would've been a corpse.

868
01:13:44,287 --> 01:13:45,828
Hey, Malar...

869
01:14:19,954 --> 01:14:21,079
I'm coming.

870
01:14:22,621 --> 01:14:23,787
Malar...

871
01:14:25,912 --> 01:14:27,246
What did you say yesterday?

872
01:14:27,828 --> 01:14:29,204
What did you say?

873
01:14:30,828 --> 01:14:32,412
As you'll be a corpse?

874
01:14:33,412 --> 01:14:35,621
I didn't sleep last night.

875
01:14:36,162 --> 01:14:37,454
Why did you say so?

876
01:14:37,454 --> 01:14:38,537
Tell me.

877
01:14:39,287 --> 01:14:40,787
Why did you say so?

878
01:14:40,787 --> 01:14:41,870
Malar...
Someone might see.

879
01:14:41,870 --> 01:14:42,954
Tell me.

880
01:14:58,787 --> 01:15:01,828
"I'm getting lost...I'm getting lost..."
"I'm almost lost..."

881
01:15:01,828 --> 01:15:09,371
"In search of me...
oh, my lass"

882
01:15:10,537 --> 01:15:13,579
"I'm getting lost... I'm getting lost..."
"I'm almost lost... "

883
01:15:13,579 --> 01:15:20,745
"In search of me...
My handsome"

884
01:15:21,663 --> 01:15:24,745
"It's sweetening in the heart"

885
01:15:24,745 --> 01:15:30,663
"Has the relationship
came in search of you?"

886
01:15:33,329 --> 01:15:44,162
"The heart beats slowly..."
"Has the life came in search of me?

887
01:15:44,995 --> 01:15:48,621
"I'm getting lost...I'm getting lost..."
"I'm almost lost..."

888
01:15:48,621 --> 01:15:55,246
"In search of me...
oh, my lass"

889
01:15:56,621 --> 01:16:00,246
"I'm getting lost... I'm getting lost..."
"I'm almost lost... "

890
01:16:00,246 --> 01:16:07,454
"In search of me...
My handsome"

891
01:16:38,204 --> 01:16:41,287
"I'll adore the spots
 wherever you kissed"

892
01:16:41,287 --> 01:16:44,537
"I'll think whether
any spot is leftover?"

893
01:16:44,537 --> 01:16:50,246
"I'll spend the whole night
 in the warmth of your body"

894
01:16:50,246 --> 01:16:55,704
"You've lit the fire in my body
with all your shyness"

895
01:16:55,704 --> 01:17:01,828
"You've done something to me,
caressing a lot"

896
01:17:01,828 --> 01:17:06,954
"You made me to live
with your love"

897
01:17:06,954 --> 01:17:09,954
"You're the goddess, my dear"

898
01:17:09,954 --> 01:17:15,287
"It's you..."

899
01:17:16,329 --> 01:17:20,037
"I'm getting lost...I'm getting lost..."
"I'm almost lost..."

900
01:17:20,037 --> 01:17:26,787
"In search of me...
oh, my lass"

901
01:17:53,663 --> 01:17:56,579
"I got lost in your thoughts
 throughout the day"

902
01:17:56,579 --> 01:17:59,912
"I got melted in your beautiful body
 without parity"

903
01:17:59,912 --> 01:18:05,287
"I'm going to articulate with you
 with both lips"

904
01:18:05,287 --> 01:18:11,246
"I'll walk as your legs
 without crossing your words"

905
01:18:11,246 --> 01:18:16,954
"I'll bear your love, gestating"

906
01:18:16,954 --> 01:18:25,329
"Dear, we both will live together
 for many births"

907
01:18:25,329 --> 01:18:30,496
"We'll live ever..."

908
01:18:31,663 --> 01:18:35,371
"I'm getting lost...I'm getting lost..."
"I'm almost lost..."

909
01:18:35,371 --> 01:18:41,787
"In search of me...
oh, my lass"

910
01:18:47,235 --> 01:18:48,527
Sir, that floor...

911
01:18:51,527 --> 01:18:52,694
This house.

912
01:18:53,944 --> 01:18:55,652
Vikram.

913
01:18:58,318 --> 01:19:00,069
Sir, come in.
-It's okay.

914
01:19:00,069 --> 01:19:01,736
I came to convey an information.

915
01:19:01,736 --> 01:19:04,153
A clan came with
weapons on that day.

916
01:19:04,153 --> 01:19:05,277
That's why,
I came chasing them.

917
01:19:05,277 --> 01:19:06,527
When investigated about them,

918
01:19:06,527 --> 01:19:08,153
It was known that
they've come to kill you.

919
01:19:08,485 --> 01:19:09,694
To kill me?

920
01:19:09,694 --> 01:19:10,819
Sir, why must they kill me?

921
01:19:10,819 --> 01:19:11,694
Will they let you go easily,
if you're in love...

922
01:19:11,694 --> 01:19:12,694
...with the Zamindar's daughter?

923
01:19:12,694 --> 01:19:14,402
They've transferred me
for arresting them.

924
01:19:14,402 --> 01:19:16,111
Be careful.

925
01:19:22,360 --> 01:19:25,902
I told to kill the guy
who is roaming behind you.

926
01:19:25,902 --> 01:19:28,569
Later, I was known that
 it's you too roaming with him.

927
01:19:28,569 --> 01:19:30,111
How dare you're!

928
01:19:30,610 --> 01:19:32,569
Hey, attend the phone.

929
01:19:33,318 --> 01:19:33,861
Who's that?

930
01:19:33,861 --> 01:19:35,652
Boss, he isn't found anywhere.

931
01:19:35,652 --> 01:19:37,277
But, we'll kill him by night.

932
01:19:37,277 --> 01:19:39,819
Kill him and bury,
the moment you see.

933
01:19:40,569 --> 01:19:41,986
Don't come back
 without finding him.

934
01:19:41,986 --> 01:19:42,777
No, dad.

935
01:19:43,194 --> 01:19:44,277
No, dad.

936
01:19:44,736 --> 01:19:46,736
I'll obey whatever you say.

937
01:19:46,736 --> 01:19:48,235
Leave him, dad.

938
01:19:48,235 --> 01:19:50,444
It's a mistake to allow you
to stay in Madurai for studies.

939
01:19:50,444 --> 01:19:51,610
Hit her hard.

940
01:19:52,944 --> 01:19:54,402
She has done a mistake unknowingly.
- hey, leave me.

941
01:19:54,402 --> 01:19:56,235
Is it the way to bring up a girl?

942
01:19:56,402 --> 01:19:58,819
I won't even meet him, hereafter.

943
01:19:58,819 --> 01:20:01,861
How strong your love is!

944
01:20:01,861 --> 01:20:03,694
I must see
 who is that great person?

945
01:20:03,694 --> 01:20:06,318
Hey, bring him
wherever he is.

946
01:20:12,235 --> 01:20:14,153
Hey...

947
01:20:28,777 --> 01:20:29,485
Come on...

948
01:20:29,485 --> 01:20:30,485
Dad!
 -come.

949
01:20:30,485 --> 01:20:31,111
Go.

950
01:20:31,444 --> 01:20:32,944
I told you to come.
 -go.

951
01:20:34,360 --> 01:20:35,485
Go inside.

952
01:20:35,485 --> 01:20:37,111
You made us ashamed.
 -dad!

953
01:20:37,111 --> 01:20:38,277
Get lost.

954
01:20:47,153 --> 01:20:49,402
She made our family embarrassed.
 -dad.

955
01:20:52,153 --> 01:20:55,652
How dare you love someone
and weep now?

956
01:20:57,485 --> 01:20:58,402
Hey, he is going to the first floor.

957
01:20:58,402 --> 01:20:58,944
Come on.

958
01:21:03,277 --> 01:21:05,027
Hey, who are you?

959
01:21:05,027 --> 01:21:06,235
Leave my grand daughter.

960
01:21:42,694 --> 01:21:43,694
Oh, my ghosh!

961
01:21:43,694 --> 01:21:44,861
He took her with him.

962
01:21:44,861 --> 01:21:46,485
My family's honour is in perils.

963
01:21:46,485 --> 01:21:49,444
Hey, catch him.
 -catch him. Don't let him escape.

964
01:22:20,902 --> 01:22:23,402
It's a boon to live
with a person close to heart.

965
01:22:23,402 --> 01:22:25,902
That's why,
 she eloped from the house.

966
01:22:25,902 --> 01:22:28,153
But, that's not a boon.

967
01:22:28,153 --> 01:22:30,444
The destiny has shown her
 that was a curse.

968
01:22:30,444 --> 01:22:33,610
To get relieved of the curse,

969
01:22:33,610 --> 01:22:38,277
Itchadaris come to Naganathaswamy temple
 on auspicious full moon day...

970
01:22:38,277 --> 01:22:41,444
...to take the miraculous
nuptial thread.

971
01:22:41,444 --> 01:22:44,986
Taking that nuptial thread
is a big bravodo.

972
01:22:44,986 --> 01:22:51,402
On that day, the fate
made her life gruesome.

973
01:23:04,902 --> 01:23:07,736
"The only soul,
as a single-hearted..."

974
01:23:07,736 --> 01:23:10,485
"You come along, my dear."

975
01:23:10,485 --> 01:23:13,485
"The only soul,
as a single-hearted..."

976
01:23:13,485 --> 01:23:16,111
"You come along, my dear."

977
01:23:16,111 --> 01:23:19,069
"The only floret,
as the only breeze..."

978
01:23:19,069 --> 01:23:22,986
"You come along, my dear."

979
01:23:22,986 --> 01:23:25,819
"The only soul,
as a single-hearted..."

980
01:23:25,819 --> 01:23:28,569
"You come along, my dear."

981
01:23:44,277 --> 01:23:50,153
"Here the stars are recasted
 as eyes and looking us,"

982
01:23:50,153 --> 01:23:55,402
"To safeguard me, not to become
 a temple statue.”

983
01:23:55,402 --> 01:24:01,027
"Let your eyes play on me."

984
01:24:01,027 --> 01:24:10,444
"Get a chariot for the stars
 to look us"

985
01:24:10,444 --> 01:24:17,402
"I'll dance, if Lord Kannan
recites the Geetha"

986
01:24:17,402 --> 01:24:20,235
"The only soul,
as a single-hearted..."

987
01:24:20,235 --> 01:24:22,986
"You come along, my dear."

988
01:24:22,986 --> 01:24:25,819
"The only soul,
as a single-hearted..."

989
01:24:25,819 --> 01:24:28,569
"You come along, my dear."

990
01:24:52,527 --> 01:24:58,153
"I'll dance, heeding the sounds
 of the bell"

991
01:24:58,153 --> 01:25:03,736
"This rainy clouds
will dance on you,"

992
01:25:03,736 --> 01:25:09,360
"Let's be intimate
with colorful countenance,"

993
01:25:09,360 --> 01:25:15,610
"This orchard will stay close to you"

994
01:25:15,610 --> 01:25:25,652
"New gushes... heaven on my side...
Nothing else..."

995
01:25:25,652 --> 01:25:28,485
"The only soul,
as a single-hearted..."

996
01:25:28,485 --> 01:25:31,235
"You come along, my dear."

997
01:25:31,235 --> 01:25:34,235
"The only soul,
as a single-hearted..."

998
01:25:34,235 --> 01:25:36,861
"You come along, my dear."

999
01:25:36,861 --> 01:25:39,819
"The only floret,
as the only breeze..."

1000
01:25:39,819 --> 01:25:43,736
"You come along, my dear."

1001
01:25:43,736 --> 01:25:46,569
"The only soul,
as a single-hearted..."

1002
01:25:46,569 --> 01:25:49,318
"You come along, my dear."

1003
01:25:49,318 --> 01:25:52,153
"The only soul,
as a single-hearted..."

1004
01:25:52,153 --> 01:25:54,902
"You come along, my dear."

1005
01:26:14,527 --> 01:26:15,318
Hey...

1006
01:26:57,777 --> 01:26:59,027
Hey...

1007
01:28:20,318 --> 01:28:22,318
Come on,
 let's take bath.

1008
01:28:22,318 --> 01:28:23,444
Let's go.

1009
01:29:16,861 --> 01:29:18,610
Hey...

1010
01:29:45,111 --> 01:29:46,069
What happened?

1011
01:29:47,485 --> 01:29:49,610
If your father had arranged
your marriage,

1012
01:29:49,610 --> 01:29:51,944
All the VIP's would've
attended the marriage.

1013
01:29:51,944 --> 01:29:54,944
The entire Madurai would've
sported a festive look.

1014
01:29:56,527 --> 01:29:59,402
Instead of someone tying
the nuptial knot in the midst of the crowd,

1015
01:29:59,402 --> 01:30:01,736
Though, no one is here...

1016
01:30:01,736 --> 01:30:04,652
I'm happy with this nuptial thread.

1017
01:30:05,402 --> 01:30:07,944
This happiness must persist
 in our entire life.

1018
01:30:07,944 --> 01:30:09,153
Definitely.

1019
01:30:09,153 --> 01:30:11,777
Not only in this birth,
in all the births...

1020
01:30:11,777 --> 01:30:13,194
... I'll be with you.

1021
01:30:33,069 --> 01:30:34,235
Hey...

1022
01:30:37,652 --> 01:30:38,569
Leave it.

1023
01:30:38,569 --> 01:30:39,944
Leave my nuptial thread.

1024
01:30:45,569 --> 01:30:46,777
Malar, you stay inside.

1025
01:31:33,360 --> 01:31:34,444
Vikram!

1026
01:31:37,111 --> 01:31:38,027
Deva...

1027
01:31:40,902 --> 01:31:41,819
Deva...

1028
01:31:43,069 --> 01:31:43,986
Deva...

1029
01:31:53,736 --> 01:31:54,652
Deva...

1030
01:31:56,736 --> 01:31:57,194
Hey...

1031
01:31:59,194 --> 01:32:02,527
For twenty five years,
 we've been suffering...

1032
01:32:02,527 --> 01:32:05,527
...as serpents in nights
and humans at day.

1033
01:32:05,527 --> 01:32:09,194
Atleast, we would've lived together
 hereafter, but you killed him.

1034
01:32:09,194 --> 01:32:10,694
Why did you kill him?

1035
01:32:11,527 --> 01:32:13,027
Why did you kill him?

1036
01:32:13,027 --> 01:32:16,027
I swear, I don't know
that he is your husband.

1037
01:32:16,027 --> 01:32:18,986
We eloped from the house
and got married.

1038
01:32:19,819 --> 01:32:21,402
The men sent by my father...

1039
01:32:26,527 --> 01:32:27,485
Vikram!

1040
01:32:32,277 --> 01:32:36,027
 In your next birth,
you'll suffer like me...

1041
01:32:36,027 --> 01:32:39,652
...as a serpent and human.

1042
01:32:39,944 --> 01:32:45,027
Every moment of your life
will be a burden with his thoughts.

1043
01:32:45,986 --> 01:32:47,360
It's my curse!

1044
01:34:19,986 --> 01:34:20,777
Divya.

1045
01:34:22,610 --> 01:34:23,402
Divya.

1046
01:34:24,777 --> 01:34:25,652
What, dear?

1047
01:34:26,652 --> 01:34:28,194
Will you come out
 for a drive?

1048
01:34:30,194 --> 01:34:31,194
You go...

1049
01:34:33,069 --> 01:34:35,527
I'll buy the pooja things.

1050
01:34:37,153 --> 01:34:39,027
Okay, you take rest.

1051
01:35:26,444 --> 01:35:28,360
I saw you earlier
 at the hotel.

1052
01:35:28,610 --> 01:35:29,902
You came in search of someone.

1053
01:35:30,360 --> 01:35:31,111
I saw...

1054
01:35:37,111 --> 01:35:38,902
Why are you starring
 at the temple?

1055
01:35:39,277 --> 01:35:41,069
I feel like I've seen it already.

1056
01:35:41,069 --> 01:35:42,485
You might've come before.

1057
01:35:43,277 --> 01:35:44,610
It's the first time
 I'm coming to Kodaikanal.

1058
01:35:44,610 --> 01:35:47,111
Then, you would've seen
 in your previous birth.

1059
01:35:47,111 --> 01:35:48,235
You mean, previous birth?

1060
01:35:48,235 --> 01:35:49,819
You say that
you haven't come here.

1061
01:35:49,819 --> 01:35:52,944
Then, how you feel that
you've seen this temple earlier?

1062
01:35:52,944 --> 01:35:56,652
Might be, you got married
 in this temple.

1063
01:35:56,652 --> 01:35:58,194
What's that you're making fun?

1064
01:35:58,194 --> 01:36:00,318
Do you believe in astrology?

1065
01:36:01,111 --> 01:36:04,153
In the horoscope, the fifth place
 is meant for last birth's deeds.

1066
01:36:04,153 --> 01:36:05,902
Do you know that?
 -I don't know.

1067
01:36:05,902 --> 01:36:10,027
Matsya(The fish), Kurma(The tortoise),
Varaha(The boar), Narasimha,(The lion man)...

1068
01:36:10,027 --> 01:36:16,402
...Vamana(The dwarf), Parasurama(The lumbar jack),
Rama, Krishna, Balarama, Kalki(The horse man)...

1069
01:36:16,402 --> 01:36:22,153
...when the god who created you
has ten incarnations, won't you have?

1070
01:36:22,153 --> 01:36:25,111
I'm doing research on last births.

1071
01:36:25,111 --> 01:36:28,027
I say with confidence,
that you and a girl got married...

1072
01:36:28,027 --> 01:36:31,153
...in the same temple,
 in your last birth.

1073
01:36:31,153 --> 01:36:32,694
What's that you're saying?

1074
01:36:32,694 --> 01:36:36,444
Like you, she is also somewhere
 in this birth.

1075
01:36:36,444 --> 01:36:38,819
I'll show you all the places
you both roamed around.

1076
01:36:38,819 --> 01:36:40,153
Then, you'll definitely
 remember everything.

1077
01:36:40,153 --> 01:36:42,360
That too before the sunset.

1078
01:36:46,111 --> 01:36:47,777
Will you come?

1079
01:36:47,777 --> 01:36:48,944
Okay, come.

1080
01:36:48,944 --> 01:36:50,277
Just a minute.

1081
01:36:52,277 --> 01:36:55,360
Naganathaswamy, he tied
the nuptial thread before you.

1082
01:36:56,569 --> 01:36:58,111
You must conjoin us.

1083
01:36:58,111 --> 01:36:59,777
Okay, let's go.

1084
01:37:36,944 --> 01:37:38,111
Stop it.
 -here only.

1085
01:37:38,111 --> 01:37:39,610
Is it here?
 -yeah, here.

1086
01:37:48,111 --> 01:37:48,819
Hello, Sarva.

1087
01:37:48,819 --> 01:37:50,318
He is mine.

1088
01:37:50,318 --> 01:37:51,986
You forget him.

1089
01:37:51,986 --> 01:37:53,694
Hey, who are you?

1090
01:38:04,610 --> 01:38:07,736
You've visited this place often
with your girl in the last birth.

1091
01:38:08,527 --> 01:38:10,444
During one of your visits,

1092
01:38:10,444 --> 01:38:13,861
You had written both of
your names in this tree...

1093
01:38:13,861 --> 01:38:15,819
... and shown her
by holding the hands.

1094
01:38:15,819 --> 01:38:16,610
It's that tree.

1095
01:38:17,277 --> 01:38:18,194
Did you see my husband?

1096
01:38:18,194 --> 01:38:18,986
No, I didn't see.

1097
01:38:43,736 --> 01:38:46,819
You said, you'll live with her
for seven births.

1098
01:38:48,402 --> 01:38:49,485
Wonderful love!

1099
01:38:49,485 --> 01:38:50,944
Love should be like this.
 Isn't it?

1100
01:38:50,944 --> 01:38:53,277
But, I don't feel
 that I wrote all these.

1101
01:38:53,777 --> 01:38:54,694
It's getting late,
 let's leave.

1102
01:38:54,694 --> 01:38:55,402
Come on.

1103
01:38:57,902 --> 01:38:59,153
Is the priest there?

1104
01:38:59,153 --> 01:39:00,736
No.

1105
01:39:06,610 --> 01:39:07,485
This place only.

1106
01:39:07,485 --> 01:39:08,194
Stop the car.

1107
01:39:13,402 --> 01:39:15,027
Do you remember this place?

1108
01:39:16,318 --> 01:39:22,569
Do you remember the big fight
 that occured on that day?

1109
01:39:23,902 --> 01:39:25,235
This place?

1110
01:39:26,111 --> 01:39:28,986
That guy banged you,
do you remember?

1111
01:39:31,610 --> 01:39:33,986
All these wasn't there, then.

1112
01:39:35,194 --> 01:39:36,569
Do you remember?

1113
01:39:37,694 --> 01:39:38,902
What are you saying?

1114
01:39:38,902 --> 01:39:39,944
I can't understand anything.

1115
01:39:39,944 --> 01:39:41,986
This is the place
 where you and that girl...

1116
01:39:41,986 --> 01:39:43,777
...got married and
were coming by car.

1117
01:39:44,277 --> 01:39:47,027
A kind of serpent called Itchadari
is there.

1118
01:39:54,277 --> 01:39:59,944
On that day, it took the humanoid form
and killed you both.

1119
01:39:59,944 --> 01:40:02,444
The serpent took the humanoid form
and killed us.

1120
01:40:02,444 --> 01:40:04,027
What else that serpent did?

1121
01:40:04,027 --> 01:40:05,111
It's the truth.

1122
01:40:05,485 --> 01:40:06,610
Believe me.

1123
01:40:06,610 --> 01:40:08,153
Don't blabber.

1124
01:40:08,153 --> 01:40:09,360
My wife is alone in the room.

1125
01:40:09,360 --> 01:40:10,360
I must go soon.

1126
01:40:10,652 --> 01:40:11,652
Get into the car.

1127
01:40:11,652 --> 01:40:13,277
I'll drop you
 where you want.

1128
01:40:13,277 --> 01:40:15,736
Simply telling tales
as serpent and human.

1129
01:40:15,736 --> 01:40:17,610
There is a limit for cheating too.

1130
01:40:17,610 --> 01:40:19,694
Saying as last birth
and next birth...

1131
01:40:19,694 --> 01:40:21,652
Humans have only one birth.

1132
01:40:21,944 --> 01:40:23,652
Don't tell lies.

1133
01:40:23,652 --> 01:40:24,318
Hello...

1134
01:40:24,318 --> 01:40:25,527
Are you coming or not?

1135
01:40:25,527 --> 01:40:27,569
If you're not coming,
 I'll leave you here and go.

1136
01:40:27,569 --> 01:40:29,111
Don't irritate me.

1137
01:40:31,602 --> 01:40:33,186
Sir, a small accident occured.

1138
01:40:33,186 --> 01:40:34,311
Nothing happened to them.

1139
01:40:34,311 --> 01:40:36,145
But, a small damage to the vehicle.

1140
01:40:36,145 --> 01:40:38,728
I left it to the mechanic
 at the foot hills.

1141
01:40:38,728 --> 01:40:40,478
He asked me to come
after two hours.

1142
01:40:40,478 --> 01:40:43,103
That's why,
I brought them here.

1143
01:40:43,103 --> 01:40:44,853
It has become a nuisance
with you.

1144
01:40:44,853 --> 01:40:47,519
It's routine for you making accidents.

1145
01:40:47,519 --> 01:40:48,395
Shit.

1146
01:40:49,602 --> 01:40:51,811
Better to expel you
 from the job.

1147
01:40:53,602 --> 01:40:54,811
Sorry, sir.

1148
01:40:56,644 --> 01:40:57,686
Oh, no!

1149
01:40:58,353 --> 01:41:02,311
You're looking the same
when I saw you twenty five years ago.

1150
01:41:03,561 --> 01:41:05,020
Did you go to Himalayas?

1151
01:41:05,020 --> 01:41:06,728
Or bought medicines from Siddhars?

1152
01:41:07,103 --> 01:41:09,602
Sir, what are you speaking about?

1153
01:41:09,602 --> 01:41:11,145
Sir, I don't know who you're.

1154
01:41:11,145 --> 01:41:12,769
You don't know me.

1155
01:41:13,020 --> 01:41:16,145
 I'm watching you
for twenty five years.

1156
01:41:17,228 --> 01:41:18,936
Sir, come in...

1157
01:41:21,020 --> 01:41:22,644
I took photos of many people.

1158
01:41:22,644 --> 01:41:26,186
But, the photo which
 impressed me is this one.

1159
01:41:41,395 --> 01:41:44,353
You've modified in Photoshop
and both of you're cheating me.

1160
01:41:44,353 --> 01:41:45,602
You shouldn't be spared.

1161
01:41:45,602 --> 01:41:46,270
Sir...

1162
01:41:46,270 --> 01:41:47,769
Sir...
-Vikram...

1163
01:41:47,769 --> 01:41:49,020
Sir, believe me.
-Vikram...

1164
01:41:49,894 --> 01:41:52,061
Sir, your phone was in the car.
 Take it.

1165
01:41:52,061 --> 01:41:52,894
Thank you.

1166
01:41:52,894 --> 01:41:55,020
Vikram, it's us who
were in that photo.

1167
01:41:55,020 --> 01:41:56,353
Please, believe me.

1168
01:41:56,602 --> 01:41:58,561
Vikram,
What I say is fact.

1169
01:41:58,561 --> 01:41:59,270
Believe me.

1170
01:41:59,270 --> 01:42:00,353
Hey, what do you want now?

1171
01:42:00,561 --> 01:42:01,728
I want you.

1172
01:42:03,145 --> 01:42:05,728
I want only you.

1173
01:42:05,728 --> 01:42:06,561
Hello...

1174
01:42:07,437 --> 01:42:09,186
I was waiting for you, all these days.
-Hello!

1175
01:42:09,186 --> 01:42:10,103
Vikram!
-Sarva!

1176
01:42:10,686 --> 01:42:12,811
Vikram! I want you.
 -hey, leave...

1177
01:42:12,811 --> 01:42:14,353
Sarva!
Where are you?

1178
01:42:14,353 --> 01:42:16,519
Vikram! I want you.
 -hello.

1179
01:42:16,519 --> 01:42:17,602
-Hello.
-leave my leg.

1180
01:42:17,602 --> 01:42:18,478
Sarva!

1181
01:42:19,145 --> 01:42:19,894
Hey...

1182
01:42:21,103 --> 01:42:22,311
Vikram!

1183
01:42:22,311 --> 01:42:23,353
Hey...

1184
01:42:25,978 --> 01:42:26,644
Vikram!

1185
01:42:38,602 --> 01:42:39,437
Where are you?

1186
01:44:02,728 --> 01:44:03,769
Malar!

1187
01:44:06,644 --> 01:44:07,145
Malar!

1188
01:44:07,145 --> 01:44:07,853
Vikram!

1189
01:44:11,061 --> 01:44:11,769
Vikram!

1190
01:44:19,395 --> 01:44:21,020
Where were you all these days?
- Vikram!

1191
01:44:28,769 --> 01:44:31,686
Swamy, I'm very much afraid
from the moment that girl spoke.

1192
01:44:45,437 --> 01:44:47,353
She is not a girl,
but a serpent!

1193
01:44:50,478 --> 01:44:53,270
The serpent which was
awaiting for twenty five years...

1194
01:44:53,270 --> 01:44:54,519
...to get your husband.

1195
01:44:54,519 --> 01:44:58,186
Now, your husband has got
caught by an Itchadhari serpent.

1196
01:45:01,686 --> 01:45:06,270
Within short time, that Itchadhari
will conjoin with your husband.

1197
01:45:06,270 --> 01:45:10,270
If that happens, he'll transform
 as an Itchadhari serpent.

1198
01:45:11,686 --> 01:45:14,894
We've come to you
as my life was in danger.

1199
01:45:14,894 --> 01:45:18,311
Now, how should I save him,
 if his life is in danger?

1200
01:45:18,311 --> 01:45:20,978
There is only one way
to save your husband.

1201
01:45:21,270 --> 01:45:22,395
Swamy, tell me.

1202
01:45:22,395 --> 01:45:25,644
These Itchadhari serpents
will spew the poison...

1203
01:45:25,644 --> 01:45:28,395
...at the time of getting relieved
from the curse.

1204
01:45:29,145 --> 01:45:33,561
When consuming this poison
 and blown on it...

1205
01:45:33,561 --> 01:45:34,811
...only then, the Itchadhari will die.

1206
01:45:34,811 --> 01:45:39,936
Only by the poison of the Itchadhari serpent,
another Itchadhari can be killed.

1207
01:45:40,769 --> 01:45:43,686
But, there's no chances of being alive
after consuming this poison.

1208
01:45:43,686 --> 01:45:47,061
If you want to survive,
that can be possible...

1209
01:45:47,061 --> 01:45:49,395
...by the grace of this god.

1210
01:45:59,020 --> 01:46:02,353
Hey, where...?

1211
01:46:02,353 --> 01:46:03,270
Where are you going?

1212
01:46:18,395 --> 01:46:20,228
Oh, Lord Shiva!

1213
01:46:26,437 --> 01:46:27,978
What have you done?

1214
01:46:28,936 --> 01:46:30,853
He came for my sake.

1215
01:46:30,853 --> 01:46:32,686
I won't go without him.

1216
01:46:39,686 --> 01:46:41,894
This sacred thread will guard you.

1217
01:46:42,936 --> 01:46:45,728
You've to kill her
when she is in humanoid form.

1218
01:46:45,728 --> 01:46:49,020
If she transforms as serpent,
even god can't kill her.

1219
01:46:49,020 --> 01:46:50,519
Go fast.

1220
01:46:50,519 --> 01:46:53,061
If they both be intimate,
he can't be saved.

1221
01:47:26,228 --> 01:47:30,270
"On your matchstick like looks,
I'm roused...I'm roused..."

1222
01:47:34,020 --> 01:47:37,936
"Because of the hot love
I'm ruffled...I'm ruffled..."

1223
01:47:41,602 --> 01:47:45,395
"Hey, the goddess of euphoria
 has come to me..."

1224
01:47:45,395 --> 01:47:49,561
"She swayed all
the five sense organs"

1225
01:47:49,561 --> 01:47:53,395
"She shot the arrrow
with her lightning eyes"

1226
01:47:53,395 --> 01:47:57,145
"She caressed my heart
 with her breath"

1227
01:47:57,145 --> 01:47:58,894
"I was standing in
the vicinity of your eyes"

1228
01:47:58,894 --> 01:48:00,894
"I came to hold your hands..."

1229
01:48:00,894 --> 01:48:04,769
"When I touch you,
where does the fake smile go?"

1230
01:48:04,769 --> 01:48:08,437
"To acquire your body,
To fulfill my needs"

1231
01:48:08,437 --> 01:48:12,353
"The attire will go off
Go ahead with your lust..."

1232
01:48:50,894 --> 01:48:58,478
"Will you come to touch me,
with the fire on your fingers!"

1233
01:48:58,478 --> 01:49:06,103
 "The fragrance rainbow,
 will you bestow all your colours?"

1234
01:49:06,103 --> 01:49:10,228
"The youthness of my life,
 Blaze in your breath perdiem"

1235
01:49:13,561 --> 01:49:17,769
"You're my night bed,
My lust pours out on it"

1236
01:49:44,519 --> 01:49:48,186
"When the eyes of the libertine
 fell on you"

1237
01:49:48,186 --> 01:49:52,103
"You called me to
bathe in the honey"

1238
01:49:52,103 --> 01:49:59,853
"I'm the amorous honey garden,
Squeeze me the whole night"

1239
01:49:59,853 --> 01:50:02,936
"Your springtide
relieves my fasting"

1240
01:50:02,936 --> 01:50:03,936
"Come and serve me..."

1241
01:50:07,270 --> 01:50:08,728
"Come on...
Why are you hesitating?"

1242
01:50:08,728 --> 01:50:11,478
"Come promptly
 to feed your hunger"

1243
01:50:15,353 --> 01:50:19,228
"On your matchstick like looks,
I'm roused...I'm roused..."

1244
01:50:40,602 --> 01:50:41,437
Hey...

1245
01:50:47,769 --> 01:50:48,769
Sarva!

1246
01:50:48,769 --> 01:50:50,228
Hey, who are you?

1247
01:50:50,686 --> 01:50:52,311
Are you asking me?

1248
01:50:52,311 --> 01:50:53,811
What happened to you?

1249
01:50:53,811 --> 01:50:54,519
Who are you?

1250
01:50:54,519 --> 01:50:55,519
I'm Vikram.

1251
01:50:55,519 --> 01:50:56,811
Vikram!

1252
01:50:56,811 --> 01:50:58,020
Sarva!

1253
01:50:58,020 --> 01:50:59,894
I don't know, who you're!

1254
01:50:59,894 --> 01:51:00,686
Leave me.

1255
01:51:00,686 --> 01:51:03,061
Sarva! why are you talking like this?

1256
01:51:04,020 --> 01:51:05,728
I'll slap you.

1257
01:51:08,228 --> 01:51:10,228
Hey, he is not your Sarva.

1258
01:51:11,978 --> 01:51:12,936
My Vikram.

1259
01:51:12,936 --> 01:51:14,186
What did you say?

1260
01:51:16,811 --> 01:51:19,186
Hey, leave her.

1261
01:51:40,769 --> 01:51:41,561
Sarva!

1262
01:51:41,561 --> 01:51:42,437
What do you want?

1263
01:51:42,437 --> 01:51:43,311
Who are you?

1264
01:51:45,811 --> 01:51:46,728
Get lost.

1265
01:51:48,395 --> 01:51:51,061
I won't leave you
without killing.

1266
01:52:52,978 --> 01:52:54,103
Oh, no!

1267
01:52:57,894 --> 01:52:59,561
Naganatha!

1268
01:53:02,145 --> 01:53:04,353
We came here
with faith on you.

1269
01:53:43,145 --> 01:53:44,686
Divya!

1270
01:53:51,853 --> 01:53:53,853
On that day, after your death...

1271
01:53:53,853 --> 01:53:57,644
...I've become an Itchadhari
on the curse of the other Itchadhari.

1272
01:53:57,644 --> 01:54:01,186
I didn't reveal it to you,
fearing you might leave me.

1273
01:54:01,186 --> 01:54:05,894
I eloped with you
 leaving my parents and everything.

1274
01:54:05,894 --> 01:54:08,936
The only reason is
my love on you...

1275
01:54:08,936 --> 01:54:14,811
But today, I'm living feared of the eagle,
mongoose, dog and the jackal.

1276
01:54:14,811 --> 01:54:18,186
The only reason is
my love on you...

1277
01:54:18,728 --> 01:54:22,519
I haven't done any
sinful deed.

1278
01:54:22,519 --> 01:54:24,395
But, I'm suffering.

1279
01:54:24,395 --> 01:54:27,561
I'm watching you.
You're acting like a goof.

1280
01:54:28,145 --> 01:54:29,519
Hey...

1281
01:55:27,936 --> 01:55:29,602
What's this?

1282
01:55:30,811 --> 01:55:35,561
An Itchadhari serpent can be killed
 only by the poison of the same kind.

1283
01:55:35,561 --> 01:55:36,186
What, dear?

1284
01:55:36,186 --> 01:55:38,353
That's why,
 I consumed the poison.

1285
01:57:35,519 --> 01:57:36,478
Divya!

1286
01:57:37,103 --> 01:57:38,353
Hey, Divya!

1287
01:57:39,894 --> 01:57:41,853
Divya, open your eyes.

1288
01:57:41,853 --> 01:57:42,811
Divya!

1289
01:57:51,561 --> 01:57:53,811
Divya, what happened to you?

1290
01:57:53,811 --> 01:57:55,395
Divya, open your eyes.

1291
01:57:58,769 --> 01:57:59,978
Divya!

1292
01:58:00,270 --> 01:58:01,061
Hey...

1293
01:58:38,103 --> 01:58:43,437
I'm living today, feared of the eagle,
mongoose, dog and the jackal.

1294
01:58:43,437 --> 01:58:46,228
The only reason is
my love on you...

1295
01:58:52,353 --> 01:58:53,728
Forgive me.

1296
01:58:53,728 --> 01:58:56,061
After seeing your
 transformation as a serpent...

1297
01:58:56,061 --> 01:58:58,644
...I got belief in last birth.

1298
01:58:58,644 --> 01:59:01,894
She is ready to sacrifice
 her life for me.

1299
01:59:01,894 --> 01:59:03,270
I can't live without her.

1300
01:59:03,270 --> 01:59:05,853
If you want to kill her,
better kill me first...

1301
01:59:05,853 --> 01:59:07,186
...and then kill her.

1302
01:59:18,103 --> 01:59:18,728
Hey...

1303
01:59:41,103 --> 01:59:41,978
Divya!

1304
02:00:03,644 --> 02:00:04,519
Divya!

1305
02:00:11,270 --> 02:00:17,186
I was dead, the moment
you decided to live with her.

1306
02:00:18,561 --> 02:00:21,561
I died for you,
in the last birth.

1307
02:00:23,853 --> 02:00:27,811
Even in this birth,
I'm dying for you.

1308
02:00:30,853 --> 02:00:35,769
At least, in next birth,
I must live with you...
