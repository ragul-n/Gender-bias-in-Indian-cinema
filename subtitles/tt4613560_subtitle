00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,560
RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

2
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:05,900
THE STORIES AND CHARACTERS DEPICTED
HERE WERE INSPIRED BY OUR HISTORY

3
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:09,300
NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED DURING
THE FILMING OF THIS PRODUCTION

4
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,560
Why is it dark in here?

5
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,860
Rahman!

6
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,130
Yes, my Bey?

7
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,460
Why are these oil lamps not lit, Rahman?

8
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:57,200
I don’t know, my Bey.

9
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,300
You’d not even be aware of it,
if all the hell broke loose

10
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:29,900
My Bey?

11
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,060
-Find something and cover that tear.
-Yes, my Bey.

12
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:42,600
No one will know about what happened here.

13
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,930
Don’t leave my father alone
for even one moment.

14
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,930
Yes, my Bey.

15
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:12,460
Thank God, your pain was as a sign of good.

16
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:17,830
So, the motherhood starts with pain
and ends with God’s mercy and grace.

17
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,200
You made us happy in these hard times.

18
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,560
May God permit us to hold
the child in our arms.

19
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:26,980
If God permits, mother.

20
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:30,620
If my Bey father recovers soon,
he would be happy too.

21
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:35,740
Of course he would. We were yearning
for a grandchild for a long time.

22
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:38,060
Of course he would be happy.

23
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,460
-Sister.
-My Gokce.

24
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,360
Gundogdu...

25
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,340
Son, we have good news.

26
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,440
Our bride Selcan is pregnant.

27
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:10,880
He will continue our progeny and
become Bey of the tribe, if God permits.

28
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,980
If God permits. Thank you, mother.

29
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,940
-May you be blessed.
-Thank you, Gokce Hatun.

30
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:25,800
You should not have left
my Bey father alone.

31
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:29,100
He is not alone, Hatun.
Rahman is with him.

32
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:32,300
You take care and do not worry
about other things.

33
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,020
What a coward.

34
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:03,160
First she sent me to the tent.
Then sent her husband after me.

35
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:10,460
So she wanted Suleyman Shah dead in order
to take revenge for her father Alpsungur.

36
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:15,400
And she was going to make me
a bait for Gundogdu at the same time.

37
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,220
Two birds with one stone.

38
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,480
I couldn’t predict that ignoble woman’s plan.

39
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:32,260
When a wolf gets old,
it becomes the laughingstock of the dogs.

40
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:37,200
What do you say, Alpargu?
Are we too old now?

41
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:17,430
Their cries tear my heart apart. I wish
we could kill them before setting on fire.

42
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:21,100
This illness is not like
the ones you know, son.

43
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:27,500
If you touch the meat or blood of these
animals, the whole tribe would be doomed.

44
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:22,840
Our Holy Mother, revive me so that
I can free myself from the dark.

45
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,960
If my father is alive
and if I can meet him...

46
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,000
...show me a sign.

47
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:37,900
Altes...

48
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:40,000
...are you here?

49
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,220
Amen.

50
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:48,160
You told me that you were prepared
to learn the truth.

51
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,280
Then come with me.

52
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,140
-Is it here?
-Yes.

53
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,900
You never saw me, Altes.

54
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:27,120
Is my father behind this door?

55
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:50,140
-Father?
-My daughter?

56
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:52,200
-Father!
-My girl!

57
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,240
Father!

58
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,400
-Father!
-My girl!

59
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,120
Father,
I thought you were killed years ago.

60
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:04,980
I always thought of you.
Hope of seeing you again kept me alive.

61
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,800
Father, why are you here?

62
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,700
Your mother, your sister and
you are in my dreams every night.

63
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:18,260
-Mother...
-What happened to your mother, my girl?

64
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:22,320
We lost her to plague last year.

65
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,800
Father, why are they holding you here?

66
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,860
Uncle told us that you were dead.

67
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:37,700
Does my uncle know that you are here?

68
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:41,040
I will talk with him and
take you out of here.

69
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,900
My girl!

70
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,130
Father?

71
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,360
My girl!

72
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,830
-Father.
-My daughter.

73
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,900
My baby!

74
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:03,840
My Elanora!

75
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,060
My baby, my Elanora!

76
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,500
Help me God!

77
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,760
Help me God!

78
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:19,820
In short, Ertugrul Bey,
just like the poet says...

79
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:25,100
I burned and turned to ash
I became a guide for the sufferers

80
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:30,300
I was a Shah and became a subject
With the fire of your love

81
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,500
With your permission, my Bey.

82
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:46,680
It is your turn to take watch.

83
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:23,500
I could not sleep.

84
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,260
Halime.

85
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,800
You know that...

86
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,580
...I have a thousand problems.

87
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,940
Their solutions are in my power...

88
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,400
...and my power is in my belief.

89
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,400
But there’s one...

90
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:57,460
...that is the most alluring amongst others...

91
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:59,820
...which also tears my heart out.

92
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,020
And the cure for that one is only you.

93
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:17,200
It was that gazelle with those beautiful eyes
that took me to you by following it...

94
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:21,900
...and then got me in this love.

95
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:26,020
I aimed to kill it...

96
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,960
...and it teared my heart out with the fire of love.

97
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,840
What I am trying to say is...

98
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,200
...since the first moment I saw you...
-Please, Ertugrul. Stop.

99
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:43,540
I shall not.

100
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:49,100
I cannot send you away with my own hands.

101
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:52,280
Do not go.

102
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,840
Stay with me.

103
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:02,800
Be the sultan of my heart,
the mother of my children...

104
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,580
...and my companion till the end.

105
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:13,940
You are a valiant and honest brave
with a good heart, Ertugrul Bey.

106
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,300
We owe you not one but a thousand lives.

107
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:28,230
But my fate was sealed a long time ago.

108
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:35,500
I cannot leave my father and brother
in a world of unknown to go after love.

109
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,740
When I could not even become
the sultan of the palace I was born in...

110
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:44,980
...I cannot be the sultan of your heart.

111
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:49,860
This is your tongue talking.

112
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,300
What about your heart?

113
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,560
What does your heart say, Halime?

114
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,160
My heart and my tongue talk the same.

115
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,400
Don’t go.

116
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:40,330
Halime!

117
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,300
Halime?

118
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:53,600
Halime!

119
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,460
Halime! Halime!

120
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,780
Halime!

121
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:05,860
-Halime!
-Halime!

122
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,460
Halime. Halime.

123
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:18,980
Halime, my girl!

124
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:23,800
Hold down the rear! Let us separate.
We will meet in Aleppo!

125
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,860
We shall separate.

126
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:40,130
Halime.

127
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:44,030
-Sister?
-Come on, boy! Come on.

128
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:46,160
-Sister!
-Come on!

129
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,530
-Sister.
-Come on, we are going.

130
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,130
Go on. Quick! Quick!

131
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:04,600
Sir, they are running away.

132
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:19,960
Ertugrul is trapped now...

133
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:25,000
...let us catch the small Shahzada
to please Ustad.

134
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,260
Get the horses.

135
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:53,960
You carry on, Shahzada.
I will catch up with you.

136
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,940
Come on. Come on!

137
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:31,140
My Bey, you catch up with them.
We will guard your back.

138
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,900
Quick, on your horses!

139
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:37,060
I will make that coward Selcan regret
the day she was born, Niya.

140
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:40,500
She will pay a heavy price for fooling me.

141
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,900
I shall breath down her neck like death.

142
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:45,960
There is no end to tricks in Selcan.

143
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:49,040
She walks in the tribe
like a ball of fire.

144
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:51,860
She bellows the fire anywhere she likes.

145
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:54,230
And if my name is Kurdoglu...

146
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:57,260
...I know how to turn that fire into ash.

147
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:02,500
You shall take one life of
that double lived coward.

148
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:06,220
Before she can hold her baby
in her arms...

149
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:09,900
...before she can brag about giving
a grandchild to the Bey bloodline...

150
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,820
...that baby shall die.

151
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:30,840
Get out of the way.

152
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,200
My dear lamb...

153
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,800
...I brought you water, get up.

154
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,230
Was it you...

155
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:07,460
...who killed my father Baybora?

156
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,230
Here you are, my girl.

157
00:28:24,530 --> 00:28:26,030
May it be easy on you.

158
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,000
May it be easy on you, sister.

159
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:33,120
With God’s permission, we are ready,
Gundogdu Bey.

160
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:41,220
What happened, my Bey? Is there something
that clouds your heart, that worries you?

161
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:46,800
It’s dangerous around here, Deli Demir.

162
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:50,420
I will allocate some trusted
Alps for your journey.

163
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:56,560
You are son of a Bey, you are a Bey.

164
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,520
You don’t need to tell me everything.

165
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:03,140
But if there is something
I need to know...

166
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,760
...you would tell me, right, my Bey?

167
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,960
I always say that caution is a virtue.

168
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:15,200
We can’t even trust the clouds above us
or the blowing wind.

169
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:21,360
Anyway, you should start
your own preparations.

170
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:23,020
Don’t talk like that, my Bey.

171
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:26,060
What kind of preparations need to be made
for a man like me?

172
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:31,600
I just have to pay my last respects to someone
while there is still time for it.

173
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,040
So, I should be doing that.

174
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:27,300
Yigit!

175
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,800
Yigit!

176
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:29,980
Was it you...

177
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:32,060
...who killed my father Baybora?

178
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,640
Baybora was like a brother to me.

179
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:39,960
Your father was killed by those who
saw us as a threat to their Seigniory.

180
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:41,380
What are you trying to say?

181
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:44,780
You should understand, the killer of
your father is Suleyman Shah.

182
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:59,340
Can those we called our Shah and
obeyed as Beys, kill us, father?

183
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:05,000
But if I am your son...

184
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:07,260
...I shall make them pay for it.

185
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:21,260
I seek refuge in God from Satan, the Accursed one.

186
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:22,820
In the name of God, the Compassionate,
the Merciful.

187
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:30,540
Amen.

188
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:36,840
I am going, my dear wife.

189
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:40,300
Leaving our lands again…

190
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:42,900
The caravan is ready.

191
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:47,400
But this time,
you will not be in the caravan.

192
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,520
You will never be able to see our new land.

193
00:33:55,880 --> 00:34:00,240
First thing will be marrying off our Aykiz
when the tribe is settled.

194
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,840
That day...

195
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:08,720
...I shall cry quietly in a corner.

196
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:15,000
As you are not beside me,
you won’t be able to wipe my tears.

197
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:21,680
Aykiz will give me a grandchild
when the time comes.

198
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:27,340
You won’t be able to hold
those little hands and feet.

199
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:34,990
My battle worn and battered heart...

200
00:34:36,490 --> 00:34:39,260
...will be even more worn out
being without you.

201
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:47,490
But no one will need to say:
“Come on. Get up, Deli Demir.

202
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:54,140
Who will make weapons for
the Alps of this tribe other than you?”

203
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:01,700
Isn’t this world a temporary moorland
for everyone, my loved one?

204
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:08,720
When the time comes, I shall join
the caravan that goes to the real home.

205
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:14,400
We will meet then.

206
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:18,130
Knowing this is enough for me, my love.

207
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:28,030
The woman I saw the first time I opened my
eyes, the woman I gave my heart and loved.

208
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:33,460
Until then, while you are under
this cold ground...

209
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:41,420
...I shall be feeling cold even
in front of the ironsmith’s fire.

210
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:45,080
I wanted you to know that.
May God bless you.

211
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,060
My sincere condolences, son.

212
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:01,400
The world is like that.
An inn with two doors.

213
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:07,440
Thank you,  Master Demir. The world is
the innkeeper, we are the travelers.

214
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:12,860
Those who finish the number of breaths
given to them go under the ground.

215
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:17,400
You are right, Bozok.
May God give you more patience.

216
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:23,100
Anyway, see you in the camp.
Peace be upon you.

217
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:29,400
Peace be upon you, Master Demir.
May you have a good journey.

218
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,620
-Yigit!
-Don’t move!

219
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:40,500
Drop down the axe or I will cut off his throat!

220
00:37:58,830 --> 00:38:00,000
Tie him up.

221
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:14,960
Halt!

222
00:38:15,830 --> 00:38:17,430
We need go faster, my Shahzada.

223
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:21,420
She loses more blood
as the horse goes faster, Ertugrul.

224
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:25,980
We shall rest here.

225
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:14,600
Ertugrul and the rest...

226
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,430
...you caught them...

227
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:20,160
...right?

228
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:23,230
Sir, Ertugrul and others...

229
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:27,860
Did you let them escape?

230
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:29,920
Have mercy on me, sir.

231
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:18,060
Gokce, put these ointments
in a place we can find easily.

232
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:21,460
-We cannot waste time during the journey.
-Alright, mother.

233
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:28,840
Selcan, don’t lift heavy things.
God forbid, you are already in pain.

234
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:36,520
Do you know what I think?

235
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:40,780
It is not wise for you stay back with
the caravan while you are pregnant.

236
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:42,680
Come with us in this journey.

237
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:48,420
Thank you, mother.
I do not know what Gundogdu would say.

238
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:52,500
I do not think that he would oppose but...

239
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:56,040
...you are right, he is your Bey,
you should ask him.

240
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:02,080
You take the arms rack.

241
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:16,340
Gundogdu...

242
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,760
...Mother Hayme says...

243
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:23,940
...I do not want to worry,
you should come with us as well.

244
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:26,320
She is worried after last night.

245
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:30,340
How come?
What happened last night for her to worry?

246
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:35,540
Because of my cramps. She is afraid that
I would get tired in the caravan...

247
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:37,780
...and something might happen to the baby.

248
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:51,300
You are staying here as well.
After last night, I would get worried too.

249
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:54,120
I want you always to be by my sight.

250
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:00,960
So you worry for your son and
you want us to stay with you.

251
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:04,020
As you wish, Gundogdu.
