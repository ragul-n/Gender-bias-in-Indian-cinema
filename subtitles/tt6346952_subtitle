00:03:50,433 --> 00:03:52,379
WOW!

3
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,102
Give it to me!

4
00:03:56,167 --> 00:03:58,113
Venkidi!

5
00:03:58,133 --> 00:04:00,135
You! Venkidi!

6
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:02,835
I got the red one!

7
00:04:04,067 --> 00:04:06,069
Come here, Venkidi!

8
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:08,835
Venkidi, Venkidi! He is calling you!

9
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,503
I said he is calling you.
Turn around!

10
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,302
Your Uncle is calling you!
Huh?

11
00:04:13,433 --> 00:04:15,435
You dumbo!
Huh?

12
00:04:15,767 --> 00:04:17,337
Why did you do that?

13
00:04:17,467 --> 00:04:19,811
Anandan is making trouble
for no reason

14
00:04:19,933 --> 00:04:21,207
Poor Venkidi!

15
00:04:21,267 --> 00:04:23,110
You! Where are you running off to?

16
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:25,169
Look at him run!

17
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,473
Hey! Venkidi!

18
00:04:38,733 --> 00:04:40,269
Where were you all this while?

19
00:04:40,367 --> 00:04:42,369
You set off in the morning

20
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,102
Can't stay home for a minute,
can you?

21
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:51,335
Where are you rushing off to?

22
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,870
Out in the sun all day!

23
00:06:21,233 --> 00:06:23,235
WOW!

24
00:06:31,367 --> 00:06:35,838
AEROPLANE

25
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,838
It was Man's greatest desire...

26
00:06:54,033 --> 00:06:55,740
...to fly like the birds

27
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,609
To conquer the skies

28
00:06:57,733 --> 00:07:01,271
it was with balloons that he first made
the wish come true

29
00:07:12,167 --> 00:07:14,169
Oh no!

30
00:07:14,633 --> 00:07:16,635
But to fly without being at the mercy
of the wind...

31
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,679
...to fly as he wished...balloons were not
enough

32
00:07:20,233 --> 00:07:22,235
Many types of planes were invented

33
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,171
They failed... and failed again

34
00:07:42,267 --> 00:07:45,544
Finally, in 1903...

35
00:07:45,667 --> 00:07:47,669
...the Wright brothers in America...

36
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,781
...built the first model of the planes we
see today

37
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:53,102
And Man started to fly!

38
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:31,913
Huh? What is it, boy?

39
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,704
I would like...

40
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:35,835
...to get on a plane

41
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,111
And where do you want to go?

42
00:08:41,167 --> 00:08:43,169
That...

43
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,708
There is one thing we can do...want to get
on my cycle?

44
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:49,835
What do you say?
Yes!

45
00:08:51,867 --> 00:08:53,710
Hop on!

46
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,802
Hold on tight!
I am!

47
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,602
See how happy the birds are

48
00:09:15,967 --> 00:09:17,878
They know their wings...

49
00:09:17,967 --> 00:09:20,641
...can take them wherever wish to go

50
00:09:21,533 --> 00:09:23,535
That is why they are happy

51
00:09:24,667 --> 00:09:27,477
Can I get a pair of wings too?

52
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,140
So that I can fly like them?

53
00:09:29,433 --> 00:09:32,903
Sure! The wings you need to get you
where you want to go...

54
00:09:33,133 --> 00:09:36,046
...will sprout on your shoulders without your
even knowing it

55
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,777
You should wish for it

56
00:09:38,867 --> 00:09:42,007
And your wish should be honest

57
00:10:26,567 --> 00:10:29,173
So many singers in Indira Teacher's
class today!

58
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,740
Have space for one more?

59
00:10:30,867 --> 00:10:33,074
If we don't, we will make some, just
for Jani!

60
00:10:33,433 --> 00:10:35,003
Step right in!

61
00:10:35,067 --> 00:10:37,069
You can sit here

62
00:10:37,433 --> 00:10:39,106
Do you like to learn music?

63
00:10:39,133 --> 00:10:41,739
Yes, I do
Then let's start

64
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,802
Isn't he interested in all this?

65
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:47,881
Him? He is preoccuppied all day...

66
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,002
...with his construction work

67
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,537
Uncle!

68
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,835
Uncle!

69
00:11:10,367 --> 00:11:11,471
Yes?

70
00:11:11,567 --> 00:11:13,569
I am going to build a plane

71
00:11:13,767 --> 00:11:17,112
That sounds good! Will you allow me on
your plane?

72
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,474
Huh?
I asked...will you let me on?

73
00:11:20,567 --> 00:11:22,569
Yes, I will

74
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,370
Look here, Uncle!

75
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:27,676
This is how my plane will be

76
00:11:36,033 --> 00:11:37,944
Can you hear me now?

77
00:11:38,067 --> 00:11:40,069
Yes!
You can?

78
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,074
I can hear

79
00:12:10,433 --> 00:12:13,676
The Princess shed tears on the
balcony...

80
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:16,769
...and the tears flowed like a river...

81
00:12:17,433 --> 00:12:20,778
When she raised her head
and looked at the sky...

82
00:12:21,267 --> 00:12:23,713
...through the moonlight, she saw a
flying carpet

83
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:27,577
She hadn't seen such a pretty carpet
anywhere in the palace

84
00:12:27,733 --> 00:12:31,704
And he was on the flying carpet,
smiling down at her

85
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:35,643
He had everything she had ever
wished for

86
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,745
And what were they?

87
00:12:37,867 --> 00:12:39,869
For the princess to trim her nails...

88
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,002
...he had the edges of stars...

89
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,970
...the murmer of the breeze...

90
00:12:44,033 --> 00:12:46,343
...a piece of a cottony cloud...

91
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:49,277
...and the baby rabbit from the moon!

92
00:12:52,733 --> 00:12:54,735
Now go to sleep, my child

93
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:03,438
What was the issue today?

94
00:13:03,733 --> 00:13:05,576
Fought with someone?

95
00:13:05,667 --> 00:13:07,340
They called me a dumbo again

96
00:13:07,433 --> 00:13:09,435
I won't go back to school

97
00:13:11,367 --> 00:13:13,608
It's ok! We will tell the teacher
tomorrow, ok?

98
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,543
No! I don't want to study anymore

99
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,602
And I don't want to go to school

100
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,402
Bring it here! Uncle will cut it for you

101
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,802
Alright. Don't open your eyes, ok?

102
00:13:49,733 --> 00:13:51,735
Here!

103
00:14:05,133 --> 00:14:06,737
<i>Janaki!</i>

104
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,802
Janakfl
Huh?

105
00:14:09,567 --> 00:14:11,569
See this plane, Janaki?
Wow!

106
00:14:14,767 --> 00:14:16,440
Did you make this, Venkidi?

107
00:14:16,533 --> 00:14:17,841
Me and Uncle

108
00:14:18,167 --> 00:14:20,169
Can it fly?
No

109
00:14:20,367 --> 00:14:22,176
It can run on the floor

110
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,302
This is for you, Janaki

111
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:26,835
I brought it for you

112
00:14:53,133 --> 00:14:55,135
Dr. Abhishek Mishra

113
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,702

...received his award from the President

122
00:15:53,267 --> 00:15:55,269
The design for the planes he built for
the Indian Air Force...

123
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:58,247
...made him eligible for the award

124
00:15:58,733 --> 00:16:01,475
it was as Junior Scientist that he started...

125
00:16:01,533 --> 00:16:03,274
...working for the DRDO in 1998.
Mom!

126
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:05,745
J Venketeshwaran is presently Chairman
of the DRDO

127
00:16:06,367 --> 00:16:09,109
His designs powered Prithvi, Agni and
other major weapons...

128
00:16:09,133 --> 00:16:12,046
...that have strengthened Indian defences

129
00:16:12,167 --> 00:16:14,647
The nation had earlier honoured
J Venketeshwaran...

130
00:16:14,733 --> 00:16:17,543
...with a Padma Shri

131
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,209
Sir, this is from Army Headquarters

132
00:17:06,267 --> 00:17:08,144
The Chief of Army Staff has a
message for you

133
00:17:08,167 --> 00:17:09,942
Please wait on the line

134
00:17:10,233 --> 00:17:12,235
Greetings, Sir! How are you?

135
00:17:13,133 --> 00:17:14,612
I am doing great, Sharmaji!
And you?

136
00:17:14,667 --> 00:17:16,669
I am good Sir. Couldn't meet you
today

137
00:17:16,967 --> 00:17:19,413
I congratulate you on your Padma
award win

138
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,511
The Forces and the nation are
proud of you

139
00:17:21,567 --> 00:17:23,171
Jai Hind, Sir

140
00:17:23,267 --> 00:17:25,110
Jai Hind and thank you!

141
00:17:25,133 --> 00:17:27,135
We will meet soon

142
00:17:27,233 --> 00:17:28,507
You take care

143
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:39,146
Can't they just send a note of
congratulations in the post?

144
00:17:40,033 --> 00:17:43,344
One could at least have some music
while driving

145
00:17:44,567 --> 00:17:47,047
It's all a matter of protocol

146
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,202
No one really wants to do it

147
00:17:49,467 --> 00:17:51,947
lam thinking of taking a break
for a bit

148
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,277
Where to?

149
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,045
Planning to go to your hometown?

150
00:17:56,467 --> 00:17:58,071
Hometown?

151
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,477
Not there

152
00:18:00,533 --> 00:18:03,070
I know...that you won't go there

153
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,537
Somewhere else

154
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,402
Anyway...catch you later

155
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:15,247
Wherever you are going,
at least let me know

156
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,602
At least keep the phone on

157
00:18:34,533 --> 00:18:36,535
I will call if there is anything
to be done - Sure, sir!

158
00:20:36,467 --> 00:20:37,537
Hello

159
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,541
Prof. Venketeshwaran? Yes

160
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:42,312
My name is Gauri. I
called to congratulate you

161
00:20:43,067 --> 00:20:45,911
Ok. I am busy right now, Gauri...

162
00:20:45,967 --> 00:20:48,208
...can you...? Sir,
I am Janaki's daughter

163
00:20:50,267 --> 00:20:52,873
I am not sure if you remember

164
00:20:54,533 --> 00:20:56,535
Your old friend...Janaki

165
00:20:57,167 --> 00:20:59,169
I am her daughter

166
00:20:59,467 --> 00:21:01,413
I have a request for you

167
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,802
That's why I called

168
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,002
I am calling from your home town

169
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:09,879
My mother...she is unwell

170
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:12,041
She is terminally ill

171
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:15,240
Maybe it's her last wish.
She would like to see you

172
00:21:19,267 --> 00:21:21,269
Hello

173
00:21:22,233 --> 00:21:24,008
Hello

174
00:21:24,167 --> 00:21:26,010
Hello, Sir...Hello?

175
00:21:26,933 --> 00:21:28,935
Hello

176
00:23:26,967 --> 00:23:28,969
Venkidi!

177
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,009
Elias...! Where are you?

178
00:24:18,167 --> 00:24:19,874
Took off so soon?

179
00:24:19,967 --> 00:24:21,878
You were not in range
when I called before

180
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:24,680
I am on the way to my hometown

181
00:24:24,833 --> 00:24:27,609
What made you change your mind?

182
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:29,674
Nothing in particular

183
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,542
I just felt like it

184
00:24:32,633 --> 00:24:34,306
And where have you reached?

185
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:36,743
I took a flight out in the morning

186
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:40,813
And now I am on a train

187
00:24:42,667 --> 00:24:44,806
I must be halfway now

188
00:24:44,967 --> 00:24:48,278
Call me once you get there...
if you need anything at all...ok?

189
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,806
I'll call you

190
00:25:02,234 --> 00:25:04,236
It's an aeroplane...look!

191
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,602
So how does this plane fly?

192
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,002
Not the sound

193
00:25:12,233 --> 00:25:15,737
How does an aeroplane
actually take off?

194
00:25:15,933 --> 00:25:17,935
Hmmm...don't know

195
00:25:40,033 --> 00:25:41,910
Now...

196
00:25:42,067 --> 00:25:44,911
...your palm is like
the wing of an aircraft

197
00:25:49,067 --> 00:25:50,910
Trust the wind

198
00:25:52,034 --> 00:25:54,207
It will show you how to fly

199
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:37,776
Come to me, oh Krishna

200
00:26:37,967 --> 00:26:42,074
Take away my sorrows, Oh Kanha

201
00:26:42,433 --> 00:26:46,575
What else could
always be on my mind...

202
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:50,113
...than your hallowed name?

203
00:26:59,967 --> 00:27:04,382
May you always be so pleased...

204
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:08,446
...as to ensure we don't go hungry

205
00:27:08,934 --> 00:27:12,814
May there always shine within me...

206
00:27:13,567 --> 00:27:17,379
...the graciousness of your gaze

207
00:27:53,467 --> 00:27:56,676
Usurper of the hearts of Gopikas...

208
00:27:57,933 --> 00:28:01,039
Herder of cows, Oh jewel-hued one!

209
00:28:02,367 --> 00:28:06,543
Usurper of the hearts of Gopikas...

210
00:28:06,733 --> 00:28:10,840
Herder of cows, Oh jewel-hued one!

211
00:28:11,034 --> 00:28:15,574
The charm of that beautiful face...

212
00:28:15,633 --> 00:28:19,775
...is what lies in my heart

213
00:28:19,933 --> 00:28:24,439
The charm of that beautiful face...

214
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:28,912
...is what lies in my heart

215
00:28:28,967 --> 00:28:30,969
Oh Kanha...

216
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:33,302
Oh Kanha...

217
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,502
Oh Kanha...

218
00:28:42,367 --> 00:28:45,405
By the time we reach, school will
be out and the kids will be gone

219
00:28:46,434 --> 00:28:47,811
You didn't tell me
where to go, Pappa

220
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,638
I thought it was at St Joseph's

221
00:28:49,867 --> 00:28:51,642
Don't get me started now!

222
00:28:51,733 --> 00:28:54,339
We had a session there
recently. You were there too

223
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:56,576
You must have been tinkering
with something at the workshop

224
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,941
Uncle entrusted an urgent
work to me when he went to town

225
00:28:59,034 --> 00:29:00,308
Could I just drop it and leave?

226
00:29:00,367 --> 00:29:02,210
No no. Dont stop now. Just go fast

227
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:04,211
Don't be upset, Pappa

228
00:29:04,267 --> 00:29:06,304
I will cut through the beach
and we will get there right away

229
00:30:21,367 --> 00:30:23,813
Sir, Venkidi has already
completed the assignment

230
00:30:27,733 --> 00:30:29,735
Let me take a look

231
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,202
I have been looking for him

232
00:30:47,433 --> 00:30:49,435
But he would not come
within my line of vision

233
00:30:49,834 --> 00:30:53,714
If I go to Murugan's looking for him, he
will disappear under one of the vehicles

234
00:30:53,967 --> 00:30:55,969
Why won't you look straight?

235
00:30:56,767 --> 00:30:58,769
I'll take the exam
next year, Sir Hmm

236
00:30:58,867 --> 00:31:00,813
He was my student during
my time at Mandapam

237
00:31:01,533 --> 00:31:04,673
So what if he is hard of hearing?
He was always top of his class

238
00:31:04,867 --> 00:31:07,677
But if anyone teased him about
his hearing, he would just drop out

239
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:10,540
He dropped out once in the 6th
grade and then in the 8th and 10th

240
00:31:10,767 --> 00:31:13,247
With great difficulty I put
him in a pre-degree class

241
00:31:13,434 --> 00:31:15,471
He went for a year and
then dropped out of that too

242
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:17,709
And this is what
he does these days!

243
00:31:17,867 --> 00:31:19,869
But doesn't he listen to you?

244
00:31:20,367 --> 00:31:23,280
Or do you just intend to
let him tag along with you?

245
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:25,502
He told me also that he
would take the exam next year

246
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,601
Oh!

247
00:31:26,867 --> 00:31:29,279
Ultimately it's
one's own decision...

248
00:31:29,734 --> 00:31:32,214
...what to study and when and how

249
00:31:32,467 --> 00:31:34,469
Hmm... no wonder he
doesn't get any better

250
00:31:34,833 --> 00:31:36,608
If this is what he is being told!

251
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:40,373
It's ok to work. But why can't
you do it after your studies?

252
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:43,274
You're not an ignorant
person... are you?

253
00:31:43,633 --> 00:31:44,907
You still have time

254
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,202
That's why I am saying this

255
00:31:59,133 --> 00:32:01,079
Go on! Go on!

256
00:32:04,133 --> 00:32:05,737
Give it full throttle!

257
00:32:06,133 --> 00:32:08,135
Oh no! What's this?

258
00:32:09,634 --> 00:32:11,272
Now the fan will rotate

259
00:32:11,434 --> 00:32:14,176
And then Pappa will gesture
for him to come forward

260
00:32:14,267 --> 00:32:16,110
Come on! Come on! It
just might go forward

261
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:18,804
Or it might not. If we could know
for sure, we could get back to work

262
00:32:19,134 --> 00:32:22,138
If we leave, who is going to
push it back? Let's wait for a bit

263
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:24,109
They have been at this for so long

264
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,612
But they never seem to
tire of it Thais true!

265
00:32:27,567 --> 00:32:29,342
It was rotating
well at the workshop

266
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,704
What's happened now?

267
00:32:30,767 --> 00:32:32,769
By the way, what's
going on over there?

268
00:32:33,233 --> 00:32:35,543
They are taking class photos.
I left after helping them set up

269
00:32:35,833 --> 00:32:38,473
You there! Why have
you drawn a moustache?

270
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,810
Huh? He does this all the time!

271
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:42,306
Wipe it off! Hey!

272
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:45,410
Nobody move! Or smile!

273
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,135
Ready! Ready!

274
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,339
Everyone look here...look this!

275
00:32:50,667 --> 00:32:52,669
Steady like a stick

276
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,311
Here we go...ready...

277
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,242
Ready?

278
00:32:57,167 --> 00:33:00,171
This is that fool Venkidi...have
you never seen his madness before?

279
00:33:00,667 --> 00:33:03,511
If you want to go, go ahead but
you can't come back for the photo

280
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,602
Yes! Only those who really
want to, need to stay

281
00:33:07,533 --> 00:33:09,535
Look! There! It is moving

282
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:13,702
Smoke! Do you think
it is going to explode?

283
00:33:13,767 --> 00:33:15,246
This looks like
trouble No! It's over

284
00:33:15,334 --> 00:33:16,404
Ready?

285
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,741
There they go again! Can't they understand?
Hey you! And you! Stop there!

286
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,402
Come on! Come on!

287
00:33:25,467 --> 00:33:27,469
Stay there...stay over there

288
00:33:28,767 --> 00:33:30,769
Move! Hey you! Quiet!

289
00:33:31,267 --> 00:33:32,644
Look here! You
can't do this anymore

290
00:33:32,667 --> 00:33:35,273
The kids are distracted
by all this noise

291
00:33:35,433 --> 00:33:38,277
I never want to see this thing
on this ground again...alright?

292
00:33:38,533 --> 00:33:41,036
Who do you think you are?
Brothers-in-law of the Wright Brothers?

293
00:33:41,134 --> 00:33:43,136
He and his plane indeed! Quiet!

294
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,510
Come on! Walk! Let's
get that picture clicked

295
00:33:45,634 --> 00:33:47,636
Scientist indeed!

296
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:53,440
The bike needs engine repairs,
Father... it has a shake, Father...

297
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:56,709
...the gear is faulty, Father...
such terrible complaints!

298
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:01,046
When you said give it to me and I will
make it fly, this is what you meant?

299
00:34:02,433 --> 00:34:04,344
I knew it right then...

300
00:34:04,433 --> 00:34:07,243
...that you wouldn't come cooing
to the Church quarters for no reason

301
00:34:07,633 --> 00:34:09,635
So he did tell you he
was going to make it fly

302
00:34:10,033 --> 00:34:12,479
And when he realised it couldn't,
he fitted it back in your bike

303
00:34:12,567 --> 00:34:15,514
You could just let
it go. Right, chief?

304
00:34:15,633 --> 00:34:17,635
Stop it, will you? What? Let it go?

305
00:34:18,167 --> 00:34:20,306
I missed a house
blessing because of this!

306
00:34:21,067 --> 00:34:24,071
I come here thinking the bike is in
perfect condition and what do I see?

307
00:34:24,234 --> 00:34:26,475
He has carted the engine
off to fly his plane!

308
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,002
And here is the bike...like...

309
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:30,671
...a squirrel that
lost its diaphragm

310
00:34:30,933 --> 00:34:33,243
Diaphragm? What do
you mean, Father?

311
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,502
Not really a diaphragm...do
you want me to make it clearer?

312
00:34:35,567 --> 00:34:37,308
Praise be to the Lord, Father!

313
00:34:37,367 --> 00:34:39,347
I was about to swear and you
come by Praising the Lord!

314
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,141
May He always be exalted!

315
00:34:41,334 --> 00:34:44,213
Don't laugh! You've
taken it too far!

316
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,976
I am going to sit here till
you have completed the work

317
00:34:48,034 --> 00:34:49,980
Oh no! That won't do, Father

318
00:34:50,067 --> 00:34:51,239
Why not?

319
00:34:51,334 --> 00:34:53,336
I've been sent to fetch Venkidi

320
00:34:53,667 --> 00:34:55,669
It's a week since he was supposed
to come over and check our car

321
00:34:56,134 --> 00:34:57,374
My father is waiting for him

322
00:34:57,467 --> 00:34:59,413
Come right now, ok?

323
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,502
I am off But how can that be?

324
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,002
He is not going anywhere
till he finishes this repair

325
00:35:06,334 --> 00:35:08,245
Or I am going to break his bones

326
00:35:08,333 --> 00:35:11,439
Let him go, Father. The
lawyer had come over yesterday

327
00:35:12,334 --> 00:35:15,247
I will take care of
your bike...will that do?

328
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:18,313
Uncle or nephew...l just
want to get my bike today

329
00:35:18,434 --> 00:35:20,436
That's it! You go on

330
00:35:28,967 --> 00:35:31,140
'Talk him out of this
aeroplane craze...

331
00:35:31,234 --> 00:35:34,272
...and get him to continue his studies,'
his mother begged of me yesterday

332
00:35:34,634 --> 00:35:36,636
That is why I was harsh
on him. Was it too much?

333
00:35:36,967 --> 00:35:38,969
You give him money
whenever he asks for it...

334
00:35:39,234 --> 00:35:40,872
...and abuse him at all other times

335
00:35:40,967 --> 00:35:43,106
Don't think I don't understand
your good cop-bad cop game

336
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,180
He will turn out fine...just fine

337
00:36:48,834 --> 00:36:50,836
Venkidi, stop! Stop!

338
00:37:01,134 --> 00:37:03,136
Is the Davani new? Yes

339
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,202
You look beautiful! I am
beautiful even otherwise

340
00:37:06,267 --> 00:37:08,269
It's not because of the Davani

341
00:37:08,467 --> 00:37:10,469
Don't get soot on me

342
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,246
Look at you! Couldn't you
at least change your shirt?

343
00:37:14,467 --> 00:37:16,913
Tomorrow is your birthday. See
me when I come to give your gift

344
00:37:17,367 --> 00:37:19,369
To repair your father's
car, this will do

345
00:37:19,934 --> 00:37:21,777
And what is the gift?

346
00:37:21,834 --> 00:37:23,142
You'll see!

347
00:37:23,167 --> 00:37:24,441
I'll bring it over tonight

348
00:37:24,467 --> 00:37:27,243
No! I don't want
your night time gift

349
00:37:27,433 --> 00:37:29,470
I will not step out

350
00:37:31,267 --> 00:37:33,213
Whatever you say, I
will come over tonight

351
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,074
And I will give you the gift

352
00:37:35,134 --> 00:37:36,340
No you won't!

353
00:37:38,367 --> 00:37:39,744
Sister? Yes!

354
00:37:39,767 --> 00:37:41,144
The milk is on the porch

355
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,838
I'll tie the cows outside to graze

356
00:37:42,867 --> 00:37:45,939
Peeli! Make sure you tie them where
they don't eat up the banana trees

357
00:37:46,034 --> 00:37:47,411
Ok I will be checking

358
00:37:47,467 --> 00:37:49,174
I also check when
I tie them up Sure!

359
00:37:49,234 --> 00:37:50,338
Just that the ropes
got loose yesterday

360
00:37:50,367 --> 00:37:52,244
Of course I know
how careful you are!

361
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:53,472
Walk on

362
00:37:54,267 --> 00:37:55,746
Just walk, will you!

363
00:37:55,767 --> 00:37:57,838
So you got hold of him, Janaki!

364
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,811
Yes! And dragged him
straight over here

365
00:38:00,234 --> 00:38:02,236
We barely get to see
you these days, Venkidi

366
00:38:02,334 --> 00:38:04,280
You only turn up if we
send someone to fetch you?

367
00:38:04,333 --> 00:38:06,335
There's too much work!
I don't get any time

368
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:08,902
And where is Indira? It's a
long time since I saw her too

369
00:38:09,233 --> 00:38:12,112
I had told her to call Janaki
for classes during the holidays

370
00:38:12,734 --> 00:38:14,441
At least that way she will
sit still for some time

371
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:16,669
She has lots of pupils during the
holidays. She has classes from morning

372
00:38:16,734 --> 00:38:17,906
I will tell her Hmm

373
00:38:17,967 --> 00:38:20,072
During holidays, kids
should be allowed to play

374
00:38:20,167 --> 00:38:22,169
And you come up with music classes!

375
00:38:22,667 --> 00:38:24,669
You needn't go anywhere, child!

376
00:38:25,067 --> 00:38:26,944
Mother spoils her!

377
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:30,144
They have been waiting for
you for a long time. Go on!

378
00:38:31,867 --> 00:38:33,141
There you are!

379
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,874
Were you expecting me to
push this all the way to you?

380
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,879
Here, take the key! And make it fast
- I need to go to Court

381
00:38:40,867 --> 00:38:43,040
My dear friend! Can't you get
someone who actually knows the job?

382
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,971
Couldn't find anyone else?
Does this guy know anything?

383
00:38:46,734 --> 00:38:47,872
What do you mean?

384
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:49,937
Since he stopped his studies,
he is the main worker there

385
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:52,737
His Uncle has turned
into his assistant

386
00:38:52,767 --> 00:38:55,373
But he is moody...sometimes he
will just drop everything and leave

387
00:38:55,767 --> 00:38:57,303
And then you won't even
find him at the workshop

388
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,744
True! He is good at his job

389
00:38:59,867 --> 00:39:02,609
He grew up in that workshop. Why
are you being nasty about him?

390
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:05,780
Maybe he is good at his
job... maybe he is smart too

391
00:39:06,733 --> 00:39:08,735
But there is a reason for that

392
00:39:09,867 --> 00:39:11,869
He was born to inter-faith parents

393
00:39:12,067 --> 00:39:13,978
It's the vigour of the mixed race

394
00:39:14,067 --> 00:39:15,944
Nothing else

395
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,140
When James died, you were
after his mother for a long time

396
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,341
You took so much abuse from her!

397
00:39:21,367 --> 00:39:22,937
But you still can't
let it go, can you?

398
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,844
If it hadn't been for this dumb
boy, she would've been my wife now

399
00:39:26,167 --> 00:39:27,976
It's her loss!

400
00:39:28,034 --> 00:39:30,207
Sure! If that's how
you want to put it!

401
00:39:31,034 --> 00:39:33,036
How else should I put it?

402
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:35,109
Why don't you come with me?

403
00:39:35,167 --> 00:39:36,942
I will send a signed
document with you

404
00:39:36,967 --> 00:39:39,243
You can handle the rest
of the transaction Ok, ok

405
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,602
And me? You go the studio

406
00:39:41,667 --> 00:39:42,839
Alright

407
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:46,204
What was the problem?

408
00:39:46,267 --> 00:39:48,247
There was some grime
at the platinum point

409
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:50,007
And I have cleaned the plug

410
00:39:50,067 --> 00:39:51,205
The key is in the car

411
00:39:51,267 --> 00:39:53,269
Ok I will settle with Murugan

412
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,739
Jump! I will catch you

413
00:40:04,967 --> 00:40:06,969
No...No touching me!

414
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:10,076
God! If someone sees...!

415
00:40:10,134 --> 00:40:12,136
Who is going to see at
this time of the night?

416
00:40:12,234 --> 00:40:13,941
Step on the cycle and get down

417
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:18,702
My hands got scratched

418
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:25,842
Where is my gift? Did you trick
me into coming out for nothing?

419
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:29,012
Your gift...

420
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:31,046
...is in another place Hmm!

421
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:33,102
Let's go together and
get it...come. Get on!

422
00:40:33,167 --> 00:40:35,374
Really? I won't come!
lam going back in

423
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,946
Venkidi! Let me go

424
00:40:44,734 --> 00:40:46,145
Why are you blindfolding me?

425
00:40:46,167 --> 00:40:48,943
It's dark. There is nothing to see

426
00:40:49,133 --> 00:40:51,044
Just because there is nothing
to see, why cover my eyes?

427
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,746
I am getting scared, ok?

428
00:40:54,967 --> 00:40:57,277
Why? I am here with you

429
00:41:03,234 --> 00:41:05,805
Get down Where have you brought me?

430
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:08,141
Where is this? I am
going to take this off

431
00:41:08,167 --> 00:41:09,976
No no...not yet!

432
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,002
I will take it off for you

433
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:13,770
Come

434
00:41:15,567 --> 00:41:17,569
Stay here, ok?

435
00:41:53,634 --> 00:41:55,705
As we rise high in the sky...

436
00:41:56,834 --> 00:41:58,780
As we rise high in the sky...

437
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:03,548
Down below a flutter
of wings in the heart

438
00:42:05,534 --> 00:42:07,571
As we rise high in the sky...

439
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,570
As we rise high in the sky...

440
00:42:11,534 --> 00:42:15,175
Down below a flutter
of wings in the heart

441
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:21,206
In the aquamarine charm of the sky

442
00:42:21,234 --> 00:42:24,113
With a person bathed
in magical colours

443
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:27,113
As I fly high UP

444
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:29,739
The sky is made of music

445
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:32,540
In a sky drenched in
the gold of the moon

446
00:42:32,767 --> 00:42:36,146
With a person whose
smile is like jasmine buds

447
00:42:36,167 --> 00:42:39,046
As I fly high UP

448
00:42:39,533 --> 00:42:42,070
The sky is made of music

449
00:42:42,833 --> 00:42:48,579
Someone has painted
the entire sky...

450
00:42:48,767 --> 00:42:53,614
...in the colours of
first love all over

451
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:57,638
Let us fly, fly together

452
00:42:59,734 --> 00:43:03,113
Let us fly, fly together

453
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:08,681
In the aquamarine charm of the sky

454
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:11,647
With a person bathed
in magical colours

455
00:43:11,967 --> 00:43:14,607
As I fly high UP

456
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:17,637
The sky is made of music

457
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:46,107
Perk up your ears
for a sweet melody...

458
00:43:46,434 --> 00:43:48,471
...an offering of my heart

459
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:50,741
Written, up in the clouds...

460
00:43:50,834 --> 00:43:53,747
...is a poem, a song of the rain

461
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:57,847
And I flow today as
an unknown river...

462
00:44:00,067 --> 00:44:03,742
I melt like unknown snow

463
00:44:05,634 --> 00:44:07,045
It is love that melts.

464
00:44:07,067 --> 00:44:09,104
...that lends us wings...

465
00:44:09,367 --> 00:44:11,779
...to rise high up together

466
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:14,508
And by your side, tender in love...

467
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:16,978
...I stand

468
00:44:18,667 --> 00:44:20,669
As I fly high up...

469
00:44:21,067 --> 00:44:23,069
As I fly high up...

470
00:44:23,734 --> 00:44:26,112
In the aquamarine
charm of the sky...

471
00:44:26,334 --> 00:44:28,712
With a person bathed
in magical colours

472
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:31,841
As I fly high up...

473
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:34,702
The sky is made of music

474
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:37,702
In a sky drenched in
the gold of the moon

475
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:40,702
With a person whose
smile is like jasmine buds

476
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:43,502
As I fly high up...

477
00:44:44,667 --> 00:44:46,806
The sky is made of music

478
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:53,106
Someone has painted
the entire sky...

479
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:58,576
...in the colours of
first love, all over

480
00:44:58,867 --> 00:45:02,314
Let us fly, fly together

481
00:45:04,867 --> 00:45:07,848
Let us fly, fly together

482
00:45:10,834 --> 00:45:13,474
Let us fly, fly together

483
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,002
How's it going?

484
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:37,575
Here

485
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:40,442
Oh! You have mastered it!

486
00:45:40,567 --> 00:45:42,478
Now take the next thread (talking
on Ham Radio in the background)

487
00:45:42,567 --> 00:45:43,807
Link it to this one...

488
00:45:43,934 --> 00:45:45,936
(Talking in German)

489
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:49,905
(Talking in German)

490
00:45:52,667 --> 00:45:55,841
We designed it exactly as he said

491
00:45:55,934 --> 00:45:57,936
And we drew it as he
said. What's he saying now?

492
00:45:58,334 --> 00:46:00,336
He got the designs we sent

493
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:03,408
But a motor bike
engine can't handle it

494
00:46:03,934 --> 00:46:05,709
It will take at least 600 <i>cc.</i>

495
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:07,538
Where do we go for that?

496
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:09,602
What if we try to
draw it differently?

497
00:46:09,634 --> 00:46:11,636
In our own way?

498
00:46:11,934 --> 00:46:14,380
I somehow feel this is not enough

499
00:46:15,267 --> 00:46:18,612
And then we get an engine
from a motor car or jeep

500
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,544
And we cut it and make the
number of cylinders half

501
00:46:21,567 --> 00:46:22,875
That might work Hmm

502
00:46:22,967 --> 00:46:24,969
Brown mentioned
that on Ham just now

503
00:46:25,434 --> 00:46:27,436
Many are doing that in Germany

504
00:46:28,534 --> 00:46:30,309
They cut a Volkswagen
engine in half...

505
00:46:30,367 --> 00:46:32,278
...and call it a half Volkswagen

506
00:46:32,634 --> 00:46:34,636
Half Volkswagen!

507
00:46:34,833 --> 00:46:37,370
We need to get one of those

508
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:40,647
From where? Where would we get one?

509
00:46:40,667 --> 00:46:42,578
You were the one who said...

510
00:46:42,634 --> 00:46:45,547
...dreams would come
alive if they were true

511
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:47,802
As far as I am concerned...

512
00:46:47,867 --> 00:46:49,869
...there is no bigger truth

513
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:56,847
(Janaki hums)

514
00:46:57,434 --> 00:46:59,471
Hey! Stop it!

515
00:47:00,567 --> 00:47:01,545
What?

516
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:04,513
Sister! I need two seat covers...

517
00:47:04,567 --> 00:47:06,205
...with pictures of birds all over

518
00:47:06,267 --> 00:47:09,441
Oh! I will have it ready
when your plane is ready

519
00:47:09,767 --> 00:47:11,713
How is the flying getting along?

520
00:47:11,767 --> 00:47:13,804
It won't be long
now Alright, alright

521
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:21,543
Half Volkswagen

522
00:47:21,667 --> 00:47:23,544
That means half of
a Volkswagen engine

523
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:25,204
Brown had mentioned this before

524
00:47:25,267 --> 00:47:27,144
We need only half...but
where would we get one?

525
00:47:27,234 --> 00:47:29,145
Aren't there old abandoned
cars in the workshop?

526
00:47:29,267 --> 00:47:30,712
Couldn't you repair one of those?

527
00:47:30,767 --> 00:47:32,769
Aren't engines the
same for all cars?

528
00:47:32,834 --> 00:47:34,836
True. They are all pretty similar

529
00:47:35,567 --> 00:47:39,310
But there is a correlation between
the engine weight and its power

530
00:47:39,867 --> 00:47:41,869
That will be different for each Oh!

531
00:47:42,134 --> 00:47:44,410
That is why we specifically
need a Volkswagen engine

532
00:47:44,834 --> 00:47:46,836
It's not that we need exactly that

533
00:47:47,434 --> 00:47:49,436
A similar build will do

534
00:47:50,133 --> 00:47:52,135
Something in 1100 <i>cc.</i>

535
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:54,605
With 4 cylinders and dry sump

536
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:57,202
And a minimum 30 hp

537
00:47:57,534 --> 00:47:59,480
It will be more work of course

538
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:01,602
There is one such in our town

539
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:03,738
Hmm? But we won't be able to get it

540
00:48:04,567 --> 00:48:06,513
What? My father's car?

541
00:48:06,567 --> 00:48:08,569
It's engine matches with
all the things I just said

542
00:48:08,667 --> 00:48:10,669
Hmm But there's no
point talking about it

543
00:48:10,734 --> 00:48:12,270
Why not?

544
00:48:12,367 --> 00:48:14,847
You can come over at night,
grab the engine and run!

545
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:17,311
Who would know?

546
00:48:17,467 --> 00:48:19,469
It's easy to say

547
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:21,511
But we also need to think
about the pros and cons

548
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:25,070
I wasn't joking. If that's the
only way out, you need to take it

549
00:48:25,434 --> 00:48:27,436
It's not like
stealing from the poor

550
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:31,572
If we get caught, we'll end up in
jail...and that will end our flying

551
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:33,404
You just need to not get caught

552
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:35,207
I will help you

553
00:48:35,567 --> 00:48:37,774
And that car? it
isn't my father's money

554
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:40,302
Uncle Sekharan sent
the money from Singapore

555
00:48:41,367 --> 00:48:44,109
I don't like that car being there

556
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:46,202
Why?

557
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:48,302
Did the car do
something to you? Hmm

558
00:48:48,534 --> 00:48:50,536
Uncle Shekharan won't
do something for nothing

559
00:48:50,767 --> 00:48:52,678
I am supposed to get
married to Anandan

560
00:48:52,734 --> 00:48:54,736
That car is the first
step to sealing that deal

561
00:48:55,234 --> 00:48:57,236
Let it not run on
the ground anymore

562
00:48:58,134 --> 00:49:00,136
Let's make it fly!

563
00:49:07,767 --> 00:49:10,077
When you make the sign of the
cross, you don't feel guilty

564
00:49:10,133 --> 00:49:12,739
The Lord in His
Mercy will forgive us

565
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:15,702
That's for sure

566
00:50:01,634 --> 00:50:03,636
Giving up on your craze to fly?

567
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:07,172
That is not a craze that will
disappear overnight, Mother

568
00:50:07,367 --> 00:50:09,244
He spent so long
putting this together

569
00:50:09,334 --> 00:50:11,007
And see how he is
burning it all up!

570
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:12,511
I am building a new plane...

571
00:50:12,567 --> 00:50:15,104
...and there is no
space here for two

572
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:44,241
You came in through the
Eastern side, didn't you?

573
00:50:44,367 --> 00:50:46,210
No one saw you, right?

574
00:50:46,367 --> 00:50:48,369
No. Where is the key to the gate?

575
00:50:48,467 --> 00:50:50,469
Pappa is in the car shed

576
00:50:51,667 --> 00:50:53,544
I was supposed to
lock the gate at night

577
00:50:53,634 --> 00:50:55,636
But I didn't lock it. I
just placed the lock on it

578
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,946
You needn't have come up

579
00:51:04,233 --> 00:51:06,235
No...go now...

580
00:51:06,634 --> 00:51:08,636
What if someone wakes up?

581
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:28,502
Hey! Come!

582
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:30,702
Push...it's in nuetral gear

583
00:51:58,433 --> 00:52:00,435
Give it to me

584
00:52:06,267 --> 00:52:08,269
Don't pull too hard. If it
snaps, there will be a sound

585
00:52:36,167 --> 00:52:38,113
To think no one heard anything!

586
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:40,510
They must be real professionals!

587
00:52:41,034 --> 00:52:42,980
We have raised alerts
at the check posts

588
00:52:43,067 --> 00:52:44,944
They couldn't have
taken it out of the state

589
00:52:45,034 --> 00:52:46,604
There are some
outsiders at the Port

590
00:52:46,633 --> 00:52:48,613
It must be in their custody True!

591
00:52:48,634 --> 00:52:50,113
First you find the car

592
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:53,376
I will see to it that he never
sees the outside world again

593
00:52:53,867 --> 00:52:56,347
Of course! You know I will!

594
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:58,573
I will have the car here
at your door step. Watch!

595
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:01,202
They are here!

596
00:53:05,367 --> 00:53:08,314
We waited two hours thinking you
would pick us up at the airport

597
00:53:08,334 --> 00:53:10,280
That is when Sugunan came
and told us what happened

598
00:53:10,333 --> 00:53:12,040
Then we took a taxi home

599
00:53:12,067 --> 00:53:14,069
It's my sister and
brother-in-law Hello!

600
00:53:14,234 --> 00:53:16,236
We were leaving for the
airport when... Hello child!

601
00:53:16,267 --> 00:53:18,144
...we saw the car was missing

602
00:53:18,167 --> 00:53:20,169
Are you well, Mother? I am!

603
00:53:20,567 --> 00:53:23,343
I have got some
special things for you

604
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:27,238
I couldn't believe it, my dear Geetha!
To think a car was stolen from here!

605
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:28,902
Everyone knows everyone here!

606
00:53:28,967 --> 00:53:30,969
I was so shocked!

607
00:53:31,067 --> 00:53:32,307
Of late our town is...

608
00:53:32,334 --> 00:53:34,473
Whoever it is, the Inspector
will have him in two days

609
00:53:35,067 --> 00:53:37,308
And then he will have to spit
out even his mother's milk

610
00:53:38,534 --> 00:53:40,844
Such an eventful journey we had!

611
00:53:41,167 --> 00:53:43,169
Come here, my child! Talk to me

612
00:53:43,534 --> 00:53:46,140
You come on in. Let the men
deal with the car and stuff

613
00:53:46,234 --> 00:53:48,111
What do you mean?
My son is not a man?

614
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:50,908
Of course he is! But he
can't deal with all this

615
00:53:51,067 --> 00:53:53,308
He is a huge coward Come!

616
00:53:56,367 --> 00:53:58,813
I didn't for a minute think
we could make it this year

617
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:02,172
To be honest, I was
planning to stay there...

618
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:04,507
...even took up
some additional work

619
00:54:05,767 --> 00:54:07,303
But he insisted

620
00:54:07,367 --> 00:54:10,143
Or we wouldn't have come

621
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:13,039
From meeting the travel
agent to booking tickets...

622
00:54:13,134 --> 00:54:15,136
...he did it all

623
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:19,007
I said it may affect my
promotion if we leave now

624
00:54:19,134 --> 00:54:21,136
But who is to listen?

625
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:23,146
He was always like that

626
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:25,202
Loves coming home!

627
00:54:26,134 --> 00:54:28,910
But for you, wherever you are
is home, isn't it, Brother?

628
00:54:29,033 --> 00:54:31,035
It's been three years
since you last came home

629
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:33,169
At least he cares!

630
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:38,179
He may live there, but his
thoughts are always here

631
00:54:38,767 --> 00:54:41,179
Isn't it so, Son? And
that is as it should be!

632
00:54:45,734 --> 00:54:47,475
Let his thoughts
remain with him for now

633
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:49,241
He can express them
after his studies

634
00:54:49,334 --> 00:54:52,406
But let's not delay it too much.
We can do it the next time you come

635
00:54:52,467 --> 00:54:54,105
Sure! Yes, yes

636
00:54:54,167 --> 00:54:56,374
She has completed her pre-degree
now. Next is her medical degree

637
00:54:56,434 --> 00:54:58,038
She can do that in Singapore

638
00:54:58,100 --> 00:55:00,102
And we can have the
wedding in between

639
00:55:00,167 --> 00:55:02,443
Yes, we can do that. His
studies also need to be completed

640
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:06,902
What happened?

641
00:55:07,033 --> 00:55:09,172
What is it, son? Fish bone!

642
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:11,075
What is it, son?
Fish bone! Fish bone!

643
00:55:11,134 --> 00:55:13,136
You do like this!

644
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:19,004
How is it? It's nothing!
Just swallow some rice

645
00:55:19,034 --> 00:55:20,274
You should've been
careful! It's not gone

646
00:55:20,334 --> 00:55:22,280
I would have removed the
bones for you It's pricking!

647
00:55:22,300 --> 00:55:23,973
I can't swallow

648
00:55:24,067 --> 00:55:26,069
Get him a banana

649
00:55:26,233 --> 00:55:28,235
No! Don't pat on his
head! Don't do that!

650
00:55:28,333 --> 00:55:30,210
Son! Do this!

651
00:55:32,100 --> 00:55:34,137
How's it? How's it now? No

652
00:55:34,234 --> 00:55:36,009
Give him a piece

653
00:55:36,067 --> 00:55:38,047
Don't chew it. Swallow!
The bone will be gone

654
00:55:38,100 --> 00:55:40,102
Should we go the hospital, son?

655
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:43,802
How are you now,
son? How do you feel?

656
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:46,712
There! It's gone!
That's all there is to it

657
00:55:48,434 --> 00:55:50,345
Did everyone...get worried?

658
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:53,074
No, no! I didn't! Of course
I did! A bone is all it takes!

659
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:55,205
Anyhow, it's gone
now. Eat! Eat, son!

660
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:02,971
Shall we move this to the door?

661
00:56:03,034 --> 00:56:04,980
There will be people at the jetty

662
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:06,875
That's better

663
00:56:06,934 --> 00:56:08,936
The Port staff will be
boarding on this trip

664
00:56:09,733 --> 00:56:11,735
Hold!

665
00:56:13,767 --> 00:56:15,269
But how could they
suspect anything?

666
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:18,213
We have cut it in half and
removed the serial number

667
00:56:18,367 --> 00:56:21,280
And because we have buffed
the case, it looks brand new

668
00:56:22,134 --> 00:56:24,910
We will say we got it from
an acquaintance of yours...

669
00:56:24,967 --> 00:56:26,344
...if anyone asks

670
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:28,043
Say nothing to anyone

671
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,344
No one will think we are using
a car engine to fly a plane

672
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:33,211
The tide is rising now

673
00:56:33,267 --> 00:56:35,713
In a day's time it
will go out to deep sea

674
00:56:36,734 --> 00:56:38,736
That car will never see land again

675
00:57:05,734 --> 00:57:07,543
Oh no!

676
00:57:07,733 --> 00:57:09,735
Got startled, Janaki?
Of course I did!

677
00:57:09,867 --> 00:57:11,642
In any case you should have
called before entering my room

678
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:14,178
Do I need permission
to enter your room?

679
00:57:14,667 --> 00:57:16,669
Is that how you see me?

680
00:57:17,034 --> 00:57:19,844
Whatever! The iron box would
have fallen to the ground

681
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,173
And my hand is burnt!
Here! Let me look

682
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:24,302
<i>No! Don“!</i>

683
00:57:27,067 --> 00:57:29,069
I got this specially for you

684
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:32,874
I was thinking of both of us
listening to this song together...

685
00:57:33,034 --> 00:57:36,277
...when that fish bone got
stuck in my throat yesterday

686
00:57:36,767 --> 00:57:38,769
Thinking of us listening together?

687
00:57:39,267 --> 00:57:41,213
And now the bone is gone?

688
00:57:41,300 --> 00:57:43,302
Ask me about it! Finally...

689
00:57:43,700 --> 00:57:45,941
"somehow, it went away

690
00:57:46,834 --> 00:57:48,677
You know what? I
don't think it is gone

691
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:51,542
That was a very peculiar bone!
It will remain right there!

692
00:57:52,067 --> 00:57:54,069
Even if you think it is gone

693
00:58:00,734 --> 00:58:03,180
Pull the string!
Only then will it fly!

694
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:05,502
Go on! Yes, go on!

695
00:58:05,567 --> 00:58:07,569
Oh God!

696
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,105
What are you doing in the middle of
the road with your eyes in the sky?

697
00:58:12,567 --> 00:58:14,137
Oh! I was...

698
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:16,946
And what is that on
your head? Sunglasses!

699
00:58:17,567 --> 00:58:19,877
Where'd you get those?
They look stylish!

700
00:58:20,067 --> 00:58:22,104
It is Anandan's. He
has brought a kite too

701
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:24,202
There! Hold it! It's coming down!

702
00:58:24,467 --> 00:58:25,946
Look, look! Hold it!

703
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,946
It's not like the kites
here! It's coming down!

704
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,002
Here, let me hold it! Give!
It will fall! It's coming down!

705
00:58:30,067 --> 00:58:32,604
There! Didn't I tell
you? Now get it down

706
00:58:32,667 --> 00:58:34,613
It's done now

707
00:58:34,667 --> 00:58:36,613
There! It's fallen
Didn't I tell you?

708
00:58:37,234 --> 00:58:39,043
Come!

709
00:58:39,134 --> 00:58:40,909
Lucky it didn't get stuck on a tree

710
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,002
Nice, isn't it?
It's Singapore-made

711
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:46,647
Wherever it's made, it
needs the wind to fly True

712
00:58:46,667 --> 00:58:48,669
Hello! It's you! Been a while!

713
00:58:48,767 --> 00:58:50,940
Here! No

714
00:58:51,134 --> 00:58:53,136
I got the kite for Janaki

715
00:58:53,234 --> 00:58:55,145
But when I called her to fly it...

716
00:58:55,234 --> 00:58:57,236
...she said she
would watch from home

717
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:59,741
When I thought of the joy of
smoking out here in the wind...

718
00:58:59,834 --> 00:59:01,836
...I set out on my own

719
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:03,777
And then these guys were with me

720
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:05,802
She must have been watching, right?

721
00:59:06,467 --> 00:59:08,606
Of course! And it rose
real high before it fell

722
00:59:08,667 --> 00:59:10,510
As high as two rolls of thread

723
00:59:10,567 --> 00:59:12,513
You are still at the workshop?

724
00:59:12,534 --> 00:59:14,912
Even if you don't smoke, I
suppose you drink. Am I right?

725
00:59:14,967 --> 00:59:16,469
Come over in the evening

726
00:59:16,534 --> 00:59:18,536
I have some good stuff...scotch!

727
00:59:18,567 --> 00:59:20,569
I am a complete teetotaller

728
00:59:20,667 --> 00:59:23,147
No drinking, no smoking

729
00:59:23,567 --> 00:59:25,569
You fly your kite

730
00:59:25,667 --> 00:59:27,578
I have to get to work

731
00:59:29,767 --> 00:59:31,678
He speaks English?

732
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:34,010
Him? That is all he does!

733
00:59:34,067 --> 00:59:36,570
Read. Build planes.
And then break them up

734
00:59:36,867 --> 00:59:38,403
Building planes? Yes!

735
00:59:38,434 --> 00:59:40,141
Is he mad? It's a kind of madness

736
00:59:40,167 --> 00:59:43,080
A higher degree of madness
Come! Let's get this to fly

737
00:59:43,134 --> 00:59:45,080
The wind is good Ok. Come

738
00:59:45,134 --> 00:59:47,136
Let me do it this time
We will go down over there

739
00:59:47,167 --> 00:59:49,078
Yes, it's nice and
windy there. That's good

740
00:59:59,967 --> 01:00:01,844
Perfect!

741
01:00:01,900 --> 01:00:03,937
I feel like going on a long drive

742
01:00:03,967 --> 01:00:05,969
How about we take off to
Velankanni? Want to come?

743
01:00:06,167 --> 01:00:08,169
I can't, Father. Got some work

744
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:10,880
That's all you ever do! Work,
work and more work! All the time!

745
01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:13,111
This time it will work

746
01:00:13,167 --> 01:00:15,044
We are trying another engine

747
01:00:15,100 --> 01:00:17,478
Roger told me. That
you went to Mangalore...

748
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:19,480
...and got an old engine

749
01:00:21,033 --> 01:00:22,944
I have a friend in Calcutta

750
01:00:22,967 --> 01:00:26,437
A priest. He is also
interested in aviation

751
01:00:26,467 --> 01:00:29,107
He has flown an ultra-light
and even has a license

752
01:00:29,667 --> 01:00:32,113
I got a letter from him
recently after a long time

753
01:00:32,167 --> 01:00:34,078
In my reply I mentioned you

754
01:00:34,934 --> 01:00:37,141
In ten days of his
getting that letter...

755
01:00:37,434 --> 01:00:39,436
...I got this parcel from Calcutta

756
01:00:39,734 --> 01:00:43,079
This is what was in it

757
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:56,138
Here. Keep this

758
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:58,346
So much? What for?

759
01:00:58,434 --> 01:01:01,005
There's no charge for fixing
the bike. I only need these books

760
01:01:01,100 --> 01:01:03,046
This is not for that!

761
01:01:03,100 --> 01:01:04,909
Just take it

762
01:01:04,967 --> 01:01:07,743
I want to fly in your plane

763
01:01:07,834 --> 01:01:09,836
Treat this as an advance

764
01:01:12,100 --> 01:01:15,479
Just think of it as something your
father James would have given you

765
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:49,371
Madhava! You have
the soap? Of course!

766
01:01:49,467 --> 01:01:51,469
You won't take a dip without
soap? Why didn't you bring one?

767
01:01:51,567 --> 01:01:53,478
Have you been reading
here all morning?

768
01:01:53,567 --> 01:01:55,478
Or you just got here?

769
01:01:55,567 --> 01:01:58,013
What does it matter? I
can't sit here anymore

770
01:01:58,667 --> 01:02:00,044
I am leaving

771
01:02:00,334 --> 01:02:02,041
Why? Won't you join in?

772
01:02:02,367 --> 01:02:04,369
Let those who haven't
seen the sea, enjoy it

773
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:11,542
Hey! I've been hearing
stories about you

774
01:02:11,634 --> 01:02:13,545
That you are building
a plane and what not!

775
01:02:13,634 --> 01:02:15,636
If I had known, I would
have got one from there

776
01:02:15,834 --> 01:02:17,836
We get them in toy shops there

777
01:02:17,967 --> 01:02:20,948
Just wind them up and they fly

778
01:02:21,034 --> 01:02:23,480
This is not a toy
What else is it then?

779
01:02:23,700 --> 01:02:25,702
You mean one in
which people can fly?

780
01:02:27,700 --> 01:02:31,045
2 seater, 65 kmph stall speed

781
01:02:31,300 --> 01:02:33,302
10,000 feet cruise altitude

782
01:02:33,733 --> 01:02:36,737
Can you get one? In
a Singapore toy shop?

783
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,946
If one is flying...

784
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,276
...it should be on one of those

785
01:02:43,533 --> 01:02:45,535
Like this!

786
01:03:38,467 --> 01:03:42,347
So many years! it was on my first trip
from Singapore that we had this inauguration

787
01:03:42,467 --> 01:03:44,913
Did my hand prove lucky?
ls business going well?

788
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:47,612
Of course! That has
been my good fortune!

789
01:03:47,734 --> 01:03:49,839
Next time I come...

790
01:03:49,934 --> 01:03:51,777
...we should develop this more

791
01:03:51,900 --> 01:03:55,347
Here! We should hold
another inauguration

792
01:03:55,534 --> 01:03:59,311
What do you think? Of course! I
was going to suggest it myself!

793
01:03:59,434 --> 01:04:01,311
(background) Singapore is Heaven!

794
01:04:05,367 --> 01:04:08,177
You should give me
one of these bottles!

795
01:04:08,334 --> 01:04:09,711
Wouldn't you have one at home?

796
01:04:09,834 --> 01:04:13,145
Let me see! It has to be
when Father is not around

797
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:15,402
If one is drinking, this
is what one should drink

798
01:04:15,534 --> 01:04:17,309
Who is in this picture? This one?

799
01:04:17,434 --> 01:04:19,675
Don't remember? That's you!

800
01:04:19,867 --> 01:04:21,676
And on the other side is Janaki

801
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:23,641
My boss took it on the day
of the studio inauguration

802
01:04:23,767 --> 01:04:25,872
I got all that. I
meant who is this...

803
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:28,510
...in the center? That's him
- Venkidi

804
01:04:28,634 --> 01:04:30,705
Those days, Boss
was after his mother

805
01:04:31,167 --> 01:04:32,805
To be her second husband

806
01:04:33,167 --> 01:04:35,169
This photo was taken to please her

807
01:04:35,333 --> 01:04:37,609
After a lot of abuse
from her, he gave up

808
01:04:37,667 --> 01:04:39,669
Let me get another drink

809
01:04:49,700 --> 01:04:51,680
Good work!

810
01:04:52,167 --> 01:04:52,838
What?

811
01:04:52,900 --> 01:04:55,676
You know what? If you tear
something apart, the mark will remain

812
01:04:55,734 --> 01:04:58,613
Then however much you
try, it won't fit together

813
01:04:58,667 --> 01:05:00,669
Just try. It Will fit

814
01:05:08,667 --> 01:05:10,647
What? M-PET?

815
01:05:11,134 --> 01:05:12,340
What's that?

816
01:05:12,433 --> 01:05:15,141
Short for Magic Carpet.
That is M-PET

817
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:17,840
When the plane is ready,
we need to give it a name

818
01:05:18,100 --> 01:05:19,477
This is the name!

819
01:05:19,534 --> 01:05:22,105
Then let's call it M-PET Pushpaka

820
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:24,202
It will sound more stylish

821
01:05:26,567 --> 01:05:28,569
I had thought of that

822
01:05:28,634 --> 01:05:31,171
But let's not have that

823
01:05:31,267 --> 01:05:33,213
Why not?

824
01:05:33,267 --> 01:05:35,269
What's wrong with that name?

825
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:39,746
Janaki is Seetha

826
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:41,711
And how did Seetha
first get on the Pushpak?

827
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:43,746
When Ravana abducted her

828
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:45,802
So, we won't have that name

829
01:05:46,100 --> 01:05:48,444
Janaki is not supposed
to board the Pushpak

830
01:05:49,500 --> 01:05:51,411
So who is Ravana in this story?

831
01:05:51,467 --> 01:05:53,413
Is it Anandan?

832
01:05:53,500 --> 01:05:57,107
Who knows who will
come in disguise?

833
01:05:57,167 --> 01:05:59,044
That's how the stories go

834
01:05:59,100 --> 01:06:01,102
You know what?

835
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:03,202
This is how this story goes!

836
01:06:03,267 --> 01:06:06,009
In this story, the
plane is meant for Janaki

837
01:06:06,067 --> 01:06:08,513
And only for Janaki

838
01:06:22,534 --> 01:06:25,674
You shouldn't be supporting
the kids in whatever they say

839
01:06:26,334 --> 01:06:29,144
Instead of showing them the right
way, you dance to their tunes!

840
01:06:29,534 --> 01:06:33,038
I came here in the night just so
I could give you a piece of my mind

841
01:06:33,367 --> 01:06:35,108
I have seen many kinds of madness

842
01:06:35,267 --> 01:06:37,304
But this is the first of its kind!

843
01:06:39,700 --> 01:06:44,479
When James died and I came
home with my two kids...

844
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,503
...I saw mocking faces all around

845
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:50,202
With great effort I stood firm...

846
01:06:50,467 --> 01:06:51,605
...and brought up the kids

847
01:06:51,667 --> 01:06:55,513
But now...the mocking is on
account of his eccentricities

848
01:06:56,100 --> 01:06:59,604
Right from childhood, who put
the idea of planes in his head?

849
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,412
His own Uncle! Don't glare at me!

850
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:05,310
And that girl Janaki
is with him all the time

851
01:07:05,667 --> 01:07:08,546
Whenever I see her, I tell her it
is time to stop the childish games

852
01:07:08,667 --> 01:07:11,409
They will build the plane
and fly together in it...

853
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:13,571
...for everyone to see,
is what Janaki Chechi says

854
01:07:13,667 --> 01:07:16,375
That's all that's lacking now!
Fly together, indeed!

855
01:07:16,467 --> 01:07:19,107
Her father will not
leave them alive!

856
01:07:19,234 --> 01:07:22,010
Ignorant children
build up fantasies

857
01:07:22,300 --> 01:07:24,576
Where is all this
leading, I wonder!

858
01:07:24,933 --> 01:07:27,140
We can't correct them with words

859
01:07:27,300 --> 01:07:29,302
He is just like his father James

860
01:07:29,434 --> 01:07:31,380
You know that!

861
01:07:31,467 --> 01:07:33,469
He has taken his own decisions

862
01:07:33,567 --> 01:07:35,478
And he will carry them out

863
01:07:35,567 --> 01:07:37,308
And in this case...

864
01:07:37,434 --> 01:07:39,311
...I am with him

865
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:41,243
Hmm

866
01:07:41,300 --> 01:07:43,211
In what case?

867
01:07:43,300 --> 01:07:45,302
Any case!

868
01:08:32,533 --> 01:08:36,413
You, my friend, who fixes lightning
wings to the dreams of clouds

869
01:08:36,567 --> 01:08:40,379
Bring us that feather of
desire rising in the sky

870
01:08:40,867 --> 01:08:44,508
You, my friend, who gives
rippling waves to the blue sea

871
01:08:45,034 --> 01:08:49,107
Bring us a wick that
can reach up to the Sun

872
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:53,246
To rock in the cradle
of a wind that uproots

873
01:08:53,467 --> 01:08:56,209
Be the wind that
rushes past the stars

874
01:08:57,467 --> 01:09:01,574
To be a swan that swims
across the infinite sky

875
01:09:01,867 --> 01:09:04,541
A song as we row with the stars

876
01:09:05,534 --> 01:09:07,810
Shouldn't we board
it? Yes we should

877
01:09:07,900 --> 01:09:10,073
And take wing? And
leave trails of dust?

878
01:09:10,134 --> 01:09:12,011
I am in! Yes, you are in!

879
01:09:12,067 --> 01:09:13,978
Lightning is flashing!
Your eyes are fluttering!

880
01:09:14,034 --> 01:09:16,344
A hero of ancient Greece

881
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:18,402
Once flew on wings of wax

882
01:09:18,434 --> 01:09:20,880
Faced smoke and fire
in the burning Sun

883
01:09:20,934 --> 01:09:23,244
Did you see it? Did you?

884
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:29,940
Whether stone or wood...

885
01:09:30,467 --> 01:09:33,277
...they soar with
the wings of the heart

886
01:09:35,167 --> 01:09:38,376
Whether fire or water...

887
01:09:39,100 --> 01:09:43,242
...they take to the
skies as spark or steam

888
01:10:08,067 --> 01:10:12,482
The moments when my mind
takes wing like a butterfly

889
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:16,107
And finally this
happens, like a dream

890
01:10:16,934 --> 01:10:20,814
A little bird, to frolic
in the morning hues...

891
01:10:20,867 --> 01:10:23,939
...is decking herself up, slowly

892
01:10:25,367 --> 01:10:28,405
Everyone has flown
through the ages...

893
01:10:29,067 --> 01:10:33,345
...on the wings of their dreams

894
01:10:33,367 --> 01:10:37,338
We have heard the tales...

895
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:41,542
...of mighty wings
cut off, shattered

896
01:10:50,167 --> 01:10:54,115
You, my friend who fixes lightning
wings to the dreams of clouds

897
01:10:54,234 --> 01:10:57,340
Bring us that feather of
desire rising in the sky

898
01:10:58,434 --> 01:11:02,849
You, my friend who gives
rippling waves to the blue sea

899
01:11:02,934 --> 01:11:06,381
Bring us a wick that
reaches up to the Sun

900
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:08,438
Shouldn't we board
it? Yes we should!

901
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:10,802
And take wing? And
leave trails of dust?

902
01:11:11,034 --> 01:11:12,911
I am in! Yes you are!

903
01:11:13,034 --> 01:11:15,036
Lightning is flashing!
Your eyes are fluttering!

904
01:11:15,134 --> 01:11:17,205
This is no illusion or magic...

905
01:11:17,300 --> 01:11:19,405
...they are the beats
of heavy hearts...

906
01:11:19,467 --> 01:11:21,777
each woven to the other!

907
01:11:21,867 --> 01:11:24,177
Come along! Come along with us!

908
01:11:54,034 --> 01:11:55,945
Come on! Push! Push! Slowly!

909
01:11:56,034 --> 01:11:57,980
Come on, push! Push! Hold!

910
01:11:59,900 --> 01:12:01,902
Push from behind! ok!

911
01:12:08,934 --> 01:12:10,971
God!

912
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,002
God! Let it fly this time!

913
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:20,802
God! Lord!

914
01:12:24,934 --> 01:12:26,936
Can you move, Sister?

915
01:12:33,767 --> 01:12:35,769
This one will fly!

916
01:12:35,867 --> 01:12:37,869
For sure! Sure!

917
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,002
It Will fly!

918
01:12:40,434 --> 01:12:42,436
Yes it will!

919
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:54,937
Let it fly, God! Please let it fly!

920
01:13:03,234 --> 01:13:05,236
Such a breeze! What a breeze!

921
01:13:05,300 --> 01:13:07,302
Feel that breeze!

922
01:13:07,634 --> 01:13:09,636
The wind is all to the rear

923
01:13:11,700 --> 01:13:13,702
Oh God!

924
01:13:19,234 --> 01:13:21,805
Hold on well! Janaki, come on!

925
01:13:22,100 --> 01:13:24,740
Shall I remove it? Yes! Push! Push!

926
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:27,244
Come on! Push harder! Go!

927
01:13:27,367 --> 01:13:29,369
Go! Yes, yes!

928
01:13:29,934 --> 01:13:31,936
Go on! Go forward! Peeli!
Move away! You might fly away!

929
01:13:32,067 --> 01:13:34,104
Everyone move! Yes!

930
01:13:34,300 --> 01:13:36,712
Stop running! It's so fast!

931
01:13:36,867 --> 01:13:38,869
Move, Father! Go!

932
01:13:40,734 --> 01:13:42,736
Don't fall! It's gaining speed

933
01:13:42,901 --> 01:13:44,903
Now move away. Move!

934
01:13:45,034 --> 01:13:47,036
Look, look!

935
01:13:50,234 --> 01:13:52,236
Move from in front of me!

936
01:13:52,301 --> 01:13:54,303
Come here!

937
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:56,602
Oh no! It's heading down!

938
01:13:56,834 --> 01:13:58,836
There! It's starting to
fly! But where is it going?

939
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,002
Brother! Venkidi!

940
01:14:01,034 --> 01:14:03,036
Venkidi!

941
01:14:03,134 --> 01:14:05,045
Venkidi! Jump! Look, hole!

942
01:14:07,201 --> 01:14:09,203
Venkidi!

943
01:14:14,701 --> 01:14:16,681
Venkidi! Oh no!

944
01:14:16,734 --> 01:14:18,736
Venkidi! Brother!

945
01:14:45,067 --> 01:14:47,069
We need to get off. Come Ok

946
01:15:18,934 --> 01:15:21,813
Prof. Veneteshwaran?

947
01:15:23,567 --> 01:15:25,569
Yes I am R K Menon

948
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:27,602
I work for KSEB

949
01:15:27,700 --> 01:15:29,611
I saw the award
function on TV yesterday.

950
01:15:29,667 --> 01:15:31,669
Congrats! Thank you!

951
01:15:33,601 --> 01:15:36,741
There were some controversies
when the award was declared

952
01:15:36,834 --> 01:15:38,871
Someone like you having
terrorist connections?

953
01:15:39,167 --> 01:15:41,613
I was really startled!

954
01:15:41,667 --> 01:15:43,669
Airport attack!
Police station attack!

955
01:15:43,734 --> 01:15:46,544
That you joined the DRDO
concealing your police cases

956
01:15:47,034 --> 01:15:50,709
I guess the press just makes
these things up...right?

957
01:15:53,867 --> 01:15:55,869
<i>No</i>

958
01:16:03,034 --> 01:16:04,707
It stings! Don't complain!

959
01:16:04,867 --> 01:16:06,869
You brought it upon yourself

960
01:16:10,467 --> 01:16:13,744
Are they with the others
from the road accident?

961
01:16:13,900 --> 01:16:15,902
This is different, Doctor

962
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:19,038
This was no road accident,
Sir...it was a plane crash

963
01:16:19,434 --> 01:16:21,812
Haven't you read in the newspapers
about planes crashing, Doctor?

964
01:16:21,900 --> 01:16:23,902
That is what this is! Look at them!

965
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,002
Skin grazed off their
bottoms... teeth loosened...

966
01:16:27,900 --> 01:16:29,902
Plane crash?

967
01:16:30,500 --> 01:16:33,071
I heard they were trying to fly
something like a plane that they made

968
01:16:33,934 --> 01:16:37,006
Wow! Really? It's
the first time...

969
01:16:37,067 --> 01:16:38,774
...I am treating
plane crash victims!

970
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:40,802
So tell me
- who was the pilot?

971
01:16:41,634 --> 01:16:43,636
No, it's alright! You may lie down

972
01:16:43,734 --> 01:16:46,112
You will be here for a few days.
I will ask for details later

973
01:16:46,601 --> 01:16:48,410
We are just glad it
stopped at this, Sir

974
01:16:48,434 --> 01:16:50,414
At least this put an end to it...

975
01:16:50,467 --> 01:16:52,447
...their crazy dream to fly!

976
01:16:52,500 --> 01:16:54,844
Ends it? Says who?

977
01:16:55,067 --> 01:16:57,604
They were saying they should not
repeat the same errors next time

978
01:16:57,734 --> 01:17:00,908
I heard them advise their
nephew just this morning

979
01:17:01,034 --> 01:17:02,638
I need to send the kids to school

980
01:17:02,667 --> 01:17:04,669
I will send someone
with the medicines

981
01:17:04,767 --> 01:17:05,837
Come away with me, Sister

982
01:17:05,867 --> 01:17:07,869
Let them continue
with their discussions

983
01:17:08,067 --> 01:17:10,069
Alright. Let's go

984
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:14,573
Next time, build a
rocket as well, ok?

985
01:17:19,100 --> 01:17:21,444
Mother, please get
that seasoned curry too

986
01:17:21,700 --> 01:17:23,475
OK

987
01:17:23,867 --> 01:17:26,074
Where is Janaki? Has she eaten?

988
01:17:26,934 --> 01:17:29,073
Once the holidays begin,
she has no such concerns

989
01:17:29,367 --> 01:17:31,369
She left in the
morning on her cycle

990
01:17:32,534 --> 01:17:33,945
Didn't you ask her
where she was going?

991
01:17:33,967 --> 01:17:35,969
Where would she go?
She'll be somewhere nearby

992
01:17:36,034 --> 01:17:38,036
Don't make me slap you!

993
01:17:38,334 --> 01:17:40,336
She'll be somewhere nearby?

994
01:17:40,434 --> 01:17:42,038
Is she a child to
be roaming around?

995
01:17:42,100 --> 01:17:43,408
Mothers should be more vigilant!

996
01:17:43,434 --> 01:17:45,414
Or else people will talk!

997
01:17:45,434 --> 01:17:47,436
What are you raging on about?

998
01:17:47,801 --> 01:17:49,803
She will be right back

999
01:17:49,867 --> 01:17:51,869
And what are you saying
people talk about?

1000
01:17:52,067 --> 01:17:54,069
That she is always roaming
around with that boy

1001
01:17:55,334 --> 01:17:57,678
Childhood friendships
should have a limit

1002
01:17:57,834 --> 01:18:00,678
She has known Venkidi since she
started taking lessons at lndira's

1003
01:18:01,034 --> 01:18:02,741
When I saw all your
drama I was worried

1004
01:18:02,767 --> 01:18:04,007
This is what the fuss was about?

1005
01:18:04,300 --> 01:18:05,677
Wait! What?

1006
01:18:05,701 --> 01:18:07,681
That friendship needs to end now

1007
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:09,802
I said no and it means no. Got it?

1008
01:18:09,834 --> 01:18:11,404
Have your food, Govindan!

1009
01:18:11,467 --> 01:18:13,469
And stop harassing her!

1010
01:18:15,767 --> 01:18:18,043
Couldn't he just stick to dusting
off the vehicles in the workshop?

1011
01:18:18,334 --> 01:18:20,541
Look at him now! Can't
even move his neck

1012
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:23,410
Since he fell on his head,
they say he broke his neck

1013
01:18:23,467 --> 01:18:26,607
(muffled) Don't spread made-up
stories. There is nothing wrong with him

1014
01:18:26,734 --> 01:18:29,271
Either take that out of
your mouth or eat it up...

1015
01:18:29,334 --> 01:18:30,472
...and then talk!

1016
01:18:30,501 --> 01:18:33,675
You don't know him at all!
This is not his first fall

1017
01:18:33,967 --> 01:18:35,969
This time was worse
than usual. True.

1018
01:18:36,500 --> 01:18:38,502
But let him get out of hospital...

1019
01:18:38,601 --> 01:18:40,945
...the next day he will start
again, I am sure. That's true!

1020
01:18:41,534 --> 01:18:42,945
Sure he will!

1021
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:47,536
Alright. Get down

1022
01:18:51,300 --> 01:18:53,302
Ok. See you later

1023
01:18:53,867 --> 01:18:57,280
I guess the decorations will be ready in time
for the club's anniversary next year...right?

1024
01:18:57,667 --> 01:18:59,704
We thought you would
finish it, Master

1025
01:18:59,767 --> 01:19:01,747
Alright, alright You're all talk!

1026
01:19:01,834 --> 01:19:03,836
Peeli...where is she going?

1027
01:19:04,634 --> 01:19:07,240
To the hospital. To see Venkidi

1028
01:19:07,634 --> 01:19:09,477
She said he will be out today

1029
01:19:09,534 --> 01:19:11,912
Kid, if you just sit there saying
his plane is not going to fly...

1030
01:19:11,967 --> 01:19:13,969
...one day it's going to fly
and she is going to fly with him

1031
01:19:14,300 --> 01:19:16,746
That's for sure! Don't
say we didn't warn you

1032
01:19:16,867 --> 01:19:19,746
Will this be enough? There
are two more bundles over there

1033
01:19:20,334 --> 01:19:22,837
Don't take the cycle!
I have milk to deliver!

1034
01:19:29,700 --> 01:19:30,644
Hey!

1035
01:19:32,467 --> 01:19:34,811
Are you trying to do antics in the
middle of the road? Move! I need to go

1036
01:19:34,834 --> 01:19:38,247
There is no need to rush. He won't
be out of hospital for a long time

1037
01:19:38,434 --> 01:19:40,971
And even if he does...he won't
even be able to walk properly

1038
01:19:41,267 --> 01:19:43,269
Go and soothe his wounds! You think
Uncle doesn't know what you are up to?

1039
01:19:45,334 --> 01:19:46,904
Move out of my way.
I said I want to go

1040
01:19:46,934 --> 01:19:49,642
Move! Let me go! Hold on. Just
let me tell you one more thing

1041
01:19:49,734 --> 01:19:52,305
Your desire to fly? That
will come true real soon

1042
01:19:54,267 --> 01:19:55,678
Don't believe me?

1043
01:19:55,734 --> 01:19:58,271
Not on his rickety plane.
On Singapore Airlines

1044
01:19:58,300 --> 01:20:00,610
The papers are ready. You will
continue your studies there

1045
01:20:01,267 --> 01:20:03,269
So all that is decided?

1046
01:20:03,467 --> 01:20:05,640
How come I didn't know?
It's not my decision

1047
01:20:05,667 --> 01:20:07,874
It's your father's. They
will tell you soon enough

1048
01:20:24,667 --> 01:20:26,772
I don't think the
engine is badly damaged

1049
01:20:27,601 --> 01:20:29,706
But the frame must
be all broken...right?

1050
01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:31,802
On my way I stopped there to look

1051
01:20:32,534 --> 01:20:34,707
The wind has rolled
it down even further

1052
01:20:35,234 --> 01:20:36,508
The wings are badly torn

1053
01:20:36,634 --> 01:20:40,275
It shouldn't be left there!
We somehow need to get it home

1054
01:20:40,367 --> 01:20:44,315
Mother said she would burn it down
with kerosene if you bring it home

1055
01:20:44,567 --> 01:20:46,444
I am not surprised she said that

1056
01:20:46,500 --> 01:20:49,208
She has warned me too that I had
better make you put an end to it

1057
01:20:49,500 --> 01:20:52,140
And it's not just your
Mother. Your Aunt too!

1058
01:20:52,534 --> 01:20:56,448
We made a mistake somewhere. If
we don't get that plane to fly...

1059
01:20:56,801 --> 01:20:58,803
...we will lose face
before the townsfolk

1060
01:21:00,300 --> 01:21:02,302
No one should see it
on the ground anymore

1061
01:21:04,067 --> 01:21:06,069
They should only see it fly

1062
01:21:13,400 --> 01:21:15,402
lam pushing! It's just not moving!

1063
01:21:15,834 --> 01:21:18,246
The wheels are jammed.
This is all it can move

1064
01:21:25,467 --> 01:21:27,413
Janaki, hand him the cycle

1065
01:21:27,467 --> 01:21:29,504
Why, Father? It's sold

1066
01:21:29,667 --> 01:21:32,170
Just give it to him
You sold my cycle?

1067
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:34,437
You are too old to be
roaming around on a cycle

1068
01:21:34,534 --> 01:21:36,480
If you haven't realised
that, this is how you will

1069
01:21:36,501 --> 01:21:38,777
Hand it over! Listen
to your father, child

1070
01:21:39,267 --> 01:21:41,543
We don't need this cycle
anymore. Give it to him

1071
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:44,612
But why are you selling
my cycle? You can take it

1072
01:21:45,767 --> 01:21:47,769
Step aside

1073
01:21:49,200 --> 01:21:52,670
I don't want you to step out of this house
again. This is the end of your wandering...

1074
01:21:52,734 --> 01:21:54,407
...and your studies too

1075
01:21:54,500 --> 01:21:57,606
If you have any ideas in your head, you
will forget them when you leave these shores

1076
01:21:57,700 --> 01:21:59,543
Understood? Enough
of scolding her now

1077
01:21:59,567 --> 01:22:01,569
She gave it, didn't she?

1078
01:22:04,267 --> 01:22:06,269
Forget it

1079
01:22:14,501 --> 01:22:16,742
Your father wants
what is good for you

1080
01:22:17,334 --> 01:22:19,280
Should you be upset over that?

1081
01:22:19,300 --> 01:22:21,780
That's what I was saying too! Here
- I got one

1082
01:22:22,500 --> 01:22:25,242
Don't be obstinate, child.
You are not alone there

1083
01:22:25,334 --> 01:22:27,405
You will be with
your Uncle and Aunt

1084
01:22:27,467 --> 01:22:30,209
Jaya has been so excited since she
heard you are going to be with them

1085
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:32,641
And Anandan is going to be
there too. What more do you need?

1086
01:22:32,667 --> 01:22:34,510
But I want to study here

1087
01:22:34,534 --> 01:22:37,014
I said before I don't
want to go to Singapore

1088
01:22:37,367 --> 01:22:40,109
That's not for you to
decide. Just get ready to go

1089
01:22:40,234 --> 01:22:42,009
There will be no more
discussions on this

1090
01:22:42,067 --> 01:22:44,069
Stop the fuss now

1091
01:22:44,734 --> 01:22:47,305
People long to see the place

1092
01:22:47,367 --> 01:22:49,438
It's your good fortune that
you are getting to study there

1093
01:22:49,500 --> 01:22:52,208
I don't want that fortune. And
I don't want to see anything

1094
01:22:52,567 --> 01:22:55,070
Once you get there, you
will change your mind

1095
01:22:55,234 --> 01:22:57,214
You will wonder why...

1096
01:22:57,267 --> 01:22:59,213
...you wasted so much time
over your lousy friendships here

1097
01:22:59,267 --> 01:23:02,942
I said I don't want to come there precisely
because I don't need lousy friendships

1098
01:23:03,301 --> 01:23:05,303
Everyone stop tormenting her

1099
01:23:06,067 --> 01:23:08,069
Come, child. Let's go inside

1100
01:23:18,267 --> 01:23:20,144
Where are you off to
with all this? I heard...

1101
01:23:20,167 --> 01:23:24,115
...that you have dragged all that crap
from the hilltop to that old man's house

1102
01:23:24,167 --> 01:23:26,169
Are you going to sit
there and work now?

1103
01:23:27,934 --> 01:23:29,936
Cat got your tongue?

1104
01:23:30,234 --> 01:23:32,043
I thought this time
you were going to stop

1105
01:23:32,101 --> 01:23:34,479
Such a curse! That you are
starting this madness again

1106
01:23:35,267 --> 01:23:36,712
You should have some
sense of priority

1107
01:23:37,134 --> 01:23:39,205
So you dreamed of something once...

1108
01:23:39,267 --> 01:23:41,269
...but you should also
know when to let it go

1109
01:23:41,567 --> 01:23:44,707
You shouldn't keep
wasting your life on that

1110
01:23:45,500 --> 01:23:47,502
This is sheer madness!

1111
01:23:48,101 --> 01:23:50,377
If it was a dream I saw in my
sleep, I would have let it go...

1112
01:23:51,634 --> 01:23:53,272
...but this is a dream
that won't let me sleep

1113
01:23:53,300 --> 01:23:54,711
If I don't fly again...

1114
01:23:55,067 --> 01:23:57,445
...all the people
around us will say...

1115
01:23:57,501 --> 01:23:59,447
...that Venkidi is mad

1116
01:24:01,034 --> 01:24:02,604
I have to fly and show them

1117
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,002
(A play performed on stage)

1118
01:24:31,201 --> 01:24:33,203
Hey! Hello

1119
01:24:33,367 --> 01:24:35,369
Feeling lonely since
they are on stage?

1120
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:38,342
If I had known it would be so
bad, I would have stayed home!

1121
01:24:38,434 --> 01:24:40,277
And here I am, battling mosquitos!

1122
01:24:40,300 --> 01:24:42,473
We can fix all that How?

1123
01:24:42,534 --> 01:24:44,536
With mosquito
repellant? I have my ways

1124
01:24:44,867 --> 01:24:47,006
Let's go upstairs. To my studio

1125
01:24:47,234 --> 01:24:49,180
You can see clearly from there

1126
01:24:49,234 --> 01:24:51,544
Come! Come on! Ok

1127
01:24:58,034 --> 01:25:00,514
In all honesty, aren't
I a well-behaved person?

1128
01:25:01,334 --> 01:25:03,541
What do I lack? But...

1129
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,207
...she...Janaki...

1130
01:25:06,334 --> 01:25:07,904
...has no respect for me

1131
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,002
It's not that she doesn't

1132
01:25:10,167 --> 01:25:12,579
She is being instigated to disrespect you.
- Instigated? By whom?

1133
01:25:13,534 --> 01:25:17,346
Who else? The aspiring
flier. It's him

1134
01:25:18,267 --> 01:25:20,941
I don't think she will leave
him behind and come to Singapore

1135
01:25:21,367 --> 01:25:23,847
No! That wouldn't matter

1136
01:25:24,534 --> 01:25:26,878
She is hesitant to
leave her parents

1137
01:25:26,967 --> 01:25:30,540
But if they take a decision and
tell her to go, why wouldn't she?

1138
01:25:32,067 --> 01:25:34,513
(humming an old song)
“Beautiful dream...

1139
01:25:34,867 --> 01:25:37,245
...the golden wings you give me...

1140
01:25:38,067 --> 01:25:41,378
(continuing to hum)

1141
01:25:49,834 --> 01:25:52,474
Was it to rewind to
that beautiful dream...

1142
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,002
...that you wanted
to go home earlier?

1143
01:25:56,867 --> 01:26:00,576
Heard? He is out of hospital
and back to his old tricks

1144
01:26:01,201 --> 01:26:03,408
If this goes on, he will
one day fly off with her

1145
01:26:04,401 --> 01:26:06,403
And you will be left gaping

1146
01:26:06,867 --> 01:26:08,847
(humming another old
song) “All I have...

1147
01:26:08,867 --> 01:26:10,540
...is an empty sky above me...

1148
01:26:10,567 --> 01:26:12,877
...and a desert below...

1149
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:20,877
He...may build it

1150
01:26:20,934 --> 01:26:22,845
But I will burn it down
before he can fly. Just watch!

1151
01:26:22,934 --> 01:26:24,971
That's fooolishness!

1152
01:26:25,067 --> 01:26:26,978
Let him fly

1153
01:26:27,034 --> 01:26:29,036
Let him have his wish

1154
01:26:29,334 --> 01:26:31,814
But he should fly only once

1155
01:26:32,134 --> 01:26:33,841
Got that?

1156
01:26:34,101 --> 01:26:36,103
I am with you, kid

1157
01:26:45,834 --> 01:26:47,575
This is the propeller

1158
01:26:47,967 --> 01:26:50,914
It's made of wood.
It's when this turns...

1159
01:26:51,167 --> 01:26:53,169
...that the plane moves forward

1160
01:26:55,034 --> 01:26:57,344
It's the shape of the wings
and the power of the wind...

1161
01:26:58,234 --> 01:27:00,180
...that makes it fly

1162
01:27:02,134 --> 01:27:05,172
So why doesn't it fly? Since
it has its wings and propellor?

1163
01:27:05,434 --> 01:27:09,041
It is not enough that it has everything.
It should all come together for it to fly

1164
01:27:10,067 --> 01:27:12,775
May it fly! May it soar!

1165
01:27:13,300 --> 01:27:16,008
Brown was on the line.
I told him everything

1166
01:27:16,134 --> 01:27:19,172
And explained the diagram
too. So what did he say?

1167
01:27:21,234 --> 01:27:23,236
The joints must be shaken

1168
01:27:23,334 --> 01:27:25,336
We will need to
re-install everything

1169
01:27:27,001 --> 01:27:29,003
The old cloth and cable should do

1170
01:27:30,300 --> 01:27:33,474
When we look sideways, and
see the runway at 45 degrees...

1171
01:27:33,767 --> 01:27:36,077
...the flap should be inclined
to 10 degrees. That is flying

1172
01:27:36,801 --> 01:27:39,042
Brown says that must
be where we went wrong

1173
01:27:39,300 --> 01:27:41,302
But he didn't say to change
anything in the structure?

1174
01:27:41,767 --> 01:27:44,111
Wing position? Tail? Anything? No!

1175
01:27:44,334 --> 01:27:46,336
All of that is perfect.
I specifically asked

1176
01:27:48,101 --> 01:27:50,103
Hello! Please come here

1177
01:27:56,300 --> 01:27:57,506
What is it?

1178
01:27:57,734 --> 01:27:58,838
Does the engine need repair?

1179
01:27:58,900 --> 01:28:01,312
It's been a while now.
Isn't it ready yet?

1180
01:28:01,900 --> 01:28:03,902
I will let you know when it is

1181
01:28:04,200 --> 01:28:06,976
Did you push your cycle all
this way just to ask me that?

1182
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,071
I came with something more serious

1183
01:28:09,134 --> 01:28:10,875
I was just being polite

1184
01:28:11,134 --> 01:28:13,136
What is the serious
thing you want to say?

1185
01:28:13,901 --> 01:28:15,903
Janaki Chechi sent this for you

1186
01:28:17,034 --> 01:28:20,038
They have locked her up
at home. Sold her cycle too

1187
01:28:39,900 --> 01:28:41,777
Why here?

1188
01:28:41,834 --> 01:28:43,836
Why did you ask me to
come here? That's unusual

1189
01:28:45,200 --> 01:28:47,202
Father says nothing
can be as usual anymore

1190
01:28:47,800 --> 01:28:49,802
He sold my cycle too. I heard

1191
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:53,441
How did you manage to get here now?

1192
01:28:54,367 --> 01:28:56,176
There was no one at home

1193
01:28:56,234 --> 01:28:58,236
Father went with them
to book the tickets

1194
01:28:58,400 --> 01:29:00,903
And Mother went to the
hospital with my Aunt

1195
01:29:02,101 --> 01:29:04,638
I slipped out. I don't know
what will happen when I get back

1196
01:29:04,867 --> 01:29:08,007
Oh! So it is true
that you are leaving

1197
01:29:09,100 --> 01:29:11,842
They are booking tickets. Let them!

1198
01:29:12,267 --> 01:29:14,269
They can't drag me there, can they?

1199
01:29:16,267 --> 01:29:19,373
But it scares me to see
the mood my father is in

1200
01:29:19,900 --> 01:29:21,902
That's why I asked you to come

1201
01:29:23,734 --> 01:29:26,715
What should I do now? You tell me!

1202
01:29:27,200 --> 01:29:30,010
Whenever you feel it is time...

1203
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:33,206
...come away with just
the clothes on your back

1204
01:29:33,901 --> 01:29:35,903
My mother will welcome
you with open arms

1205
01:29:37,134 --> 01:29:40,240
We have talked about all this.
Why are you in doubt now?

1206
01:29:41,267 --> 01:29:45,113
It's easy to say. You know
what my father is like

1207
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:48,740
You really think he will let us live
life on our terms before his eyes?

1208
01:29:49,834 --> 01:29:51,836
Let's go away somewhere, Venkidi

1209
01:29:52,101 --> 01:29:54,138
Where none of them can reach us

1210
01:29:54,667 --> 01:29:56,669
How can we live in such fear?

1211
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:06,837
The wind has to blow
from the opposite...

1212
01:30:07,567 --> 01:30:10,639
...only then will the plane
leave the ground and fly

1213
01:30:10,900 --> 01:30:12,709
Both are the same

1214
01:30:12,734 --> 01:30:14,736
Our dreams...

1215
01:30:15,034 --> 01:30:16,843
...and our plane

1216
01:30:16,867 --> 01:30:18,972
Let everyone oppose us

1217
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:22,072
We will fly over them all

1218
01:30:22,567 --> 01:30:24,569
Won't we? Yes!

1219
01:30:24,634 --> 01:30:26,580
Don't you want to fly with me?

1220
01:30:36,834 --> 01:30:40,213
Come on, move! Mother, this
boy won't let me stick my bindi!

1221
01:30:40,267 --> 01:30:43,840
Stop it both of you! You
will be late again today!

1222
01:30:43,967 --> 01:30:46,140
Go to your father. Ask
him to do it for you

1223
01:30:46,167 --> 01:30:48,977
I don't need help. I
will do it on my own

1224
01:30:49,100 --> 01:30:51,580
That's better, my child! Your
mother is in a foul mood this morning

1225
01:30:51,667 --> 01:30:53,044
You can't predict
what she will say next!

1226
01:30:53,101 --> 01:30:54,910
My saying things is the
problem? Just go to work now

1227
01:30:54,934 --> 01:30:56,743
Been to the temple? Yes

1228
01:30:56,767 --> 01:30:58,713
And where is he? Left for work?

1229
01:30:58,801 --> 01:31:00,712
You should know where he is

1230
01:31:00,767 --> 01:31:02,576
He didn't even come home yesterday

1231
01:31:02,600 --> 01:31:05,012
Such a role model for caring
for your mother and sister!

1232
01:31:05,167 --> 01:31:07,078
Don't be mad at him, Sister

1233
01:31:07,134 --> 01:31:09,478
He is busy with something.
He will be home tonight

1234
01:31:09,501 --> 01:31:11,674
It's not as if he is busy
with a job or something!

1235
01:31:11,734 --> 01:31:13,714
Are you calling his craziness work?

1236
01:31:13,767 --> 01:31:16,873
That's right, Sister! When they got
out of hospital I had told him...

1237
01:31:16,900 --> 01:31:18,504
...to stop him from all this

1238
01:31:18,534 --> 01:31:21,981
And now...all the tools from the
workshop are over at the old man's place

1239
01:31:22,101 --> 01:31:24,103
Now all their activities
are based there

1240
01:31:24,767 --> 01:31:27,646
I thought they had learnt their
lesson. But apparently not.

1241
01:31:27,800 --> 01:31:30,906
The work is complete now. I saw it when
I went to give Janaki Chechi's letter

1242
01:31:32,667 --> 01:31:34,476
Letter? What letter?

1243
01:31:34,567 --> 01:31:36,808
Love letter, I guess.
I did not open it

1244
01:31:36,834 --> 01:31:38,814
Go on, now! No more of
your big people's talk!

1245
01:31:38,867 --> 01:31:41,074
And we know who
encourages all this!

1246
01:31:41,834 --> 01:31:43,245
You come on in, Sister

1247
01:31:43,500 --> 01:31:45,673
I need to get to the workshop

1248
01:31:46,067 --> 01:31:48,911
Go on, go on! You are the
one who made him like this!

1249
01:31:58,034 --> 01:31:59,980
You had to push this
crap here! Idiot!

1250
01:32:00,467 --> 01:32:01,502
Can't you see either, dumbo?

1251
01:32:01,667 --> 01:32:03,442
If I hadn't braked in time
you would have been flattened!

1252
01:32:03,634 --> 01:32:06,774
When an expensive car comes along, you
should move junk like this out of the way...

1253
01:32:06,834 --> 01:32:09,747
...instead of trying
to compete head-on

1254
01:32:10,400 --> 01:32:13,404
If my car had been even
scratched by your rusty pile...!

1255
01:32:14,467 --> 01:32:16,947
It's a brand new car.
My Uncle bought it. For me.

1256
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:20,470
In my name. You know what
that means, don't you?

1257
01:32:24,534 --> 01:32:27,481
Don't let me see you after her with
tales of your silly plane anymore

1258
01:32:27,634 --> 01:32:29,636
Hear me?

1259
01:32:39,900 --> 01:32:41,880
No. I think you need
to tighten it some more

1260
01:32:42,467 --> 01:32:45,073
Just check the sides too. I think
it needs some tightening there too

1261
01:32:49,801 --> 01:32:51,803
This time let's not have onlookers

1262
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,002
Let people see after we have flown

1263
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:56,402
That's better. Let no one see

1264
01:32:56,900 --> 01:32:58,846
We should get it to the top
of the hill before it's light

1265
01:32:59,034 --> 01:33:01,947
Just you, me and Uncle.
That is enough

1266
01:33:03,001 --> 01:33:05,003
What about Janaki?
Shouldn't she be there too?

1267
01:33:05,467 --> 01:33:07,469
She should.

1268
01:33:07,501 --> 01:33:09,606
But I don't know how
things are at her place

1269
01:33:21,101 --> 01:33:23,775
What are you laughing
about? Nothing

1270
01:33:24,734 --> 01:33:26,475
I was just thinking about...

1271
01:33:26,501 --> 01:33:29,573
...the <i>7</i> year old who told me
'I want to build a plane, Pappa'

1272
01:33:30,767 --> 01:33:33,680
And why were you laughing?
I wasn't thinking about that

1273
01:33:33,834 --> 01:33:37,338
Then? I was thinking, two of your
teeth got loosened the last time...

1274
01:33:37,400 --> 01:33:40,779
...if they fall off tomorrow,
what will your face look like?

1275
01:34:15,434 --> 01:34:17,436
Were you sleepy? No

1276
01:34:17,767 --> 01:34:20,270
I was just staring
out into the night

1277
01:34:20,867 --> 01:34:22,869
I am coming from Pappa's house

1278
01:34:23,001 --> 01:34:25,003
The work's all done but...

1279
01:34:25,467 --> 01:34:27,469
...everything needs to be
checked again before flying

1280
01:34:27,901 --> 01:34:29,278
That's why I came so late

1281
01:34:29,334 --> 01:34:31,280
So...you will fly here tomorrow?

1282
01:34:32,900 --> 01:34:34,902
I will be waiting

1283
01:34:35,634 --> 01:34:37,375
You won't come?

1284
01:34:37,434 --> 01:34:39,846
I came to call you...to fly with me

1285
01:34:40,567 --> 01:34:43,810
No. I think my mother found
out that I was out that day

1286
01:34:46,934 --> 01:34:49,437
For two days, it was a nightmare

1287
01:34:49,901 --> 01:34:52,541
Now there is always someone at home

1288
01:34:53,267 --> 01:34:55,269
How would I come tomorrow?

1289
01:34:55,700 --> 01:34:58,306
It's ok. I will come
flying to see you

1290
01:35:00,534 --> 01:35:03,208
And where is the Singapore
company? Is he here?

1291
01:35:03,267 --> 01:35:05,269
Where else?

1292
01:35:05,401 --> 01:35:08,245
Anyway they have realised
they can't take me willingly

1293
01:35:09,400 --> 01:35:11,402
But somethings afoot

1294
01:35:11,634 --> 01:35:13,636
I heard they have
shopped for clothes for me

1295
01:35:14,567 --> 01:35:16,444
I'd met Anandan And?

1296
01:35:16,501 --> 01:35:18,447
He was blabbering
on about something

1297
01:35:18,567 --> 01:35:20,774
I wasn't listening. He is poison!

1298
01:35:21,267 --> 01:35:23,269
You need to be careful!

1299
01:35:23,667 --> 01:35:25,704
Anyhow...

1300
01:35:25,867 --> 01:35:27,676
...when is the auspicious
moment tomorrow?

1301
01:35:27,734 --> 01:35:29,736
This time we don't
want anyone to watch

1302
01:35:29,900 --> 01:35:31,902
Early in the morning...

1303
01:35:31,967 --> 01:35:33,969
...we will push the plane uphill

1304
01:35:34,567 --> 01:35:37,707
When the sun is up, we will fly

1305
01:35:38,667 --> 01:35:41,580
Then get going now.
You have to up early

1306
01:35:42,967 --> 01:35:45,948
And come flying. I will be waiting

1307
01:36:00,867 --> 01:36:02,403
What is it, child?

1308
01:36:02,434 --> 01:36:04,846
Papa...l think there's someone...

1309
01:36:05,401 --> 01:36:07,779
...walking outside. I've
been hearing it for a while

1310
01:36:08,234 --> 01:36:10,236
That must be him
- Venkidi

1311
01:36:10,867 --> 01:36:13,347
He musn't be getting sleepy with
the excitement of flying tomorrow

1312
01:36:14,667 --> 01:36:17,671
If it's him, wouldn't he call
us, seeing the lights are on?

1313
01:36:38,300 --> 01:36:40,302
No...there's no one here

1314
01:36:42,534 --> 01:36:43,911
Must've been just a feeling

1315
01:36:44,267 --> 01:36:46,269
Who's there?

1316
01:36:46,334 --> 01:36:48,371
Who?

1317
01:36:50,934 --> 01:36:52,607
Must be a dog or something.

1318
01:36:52,700 --> 01:36:54,702
You come back in, Papa

1319
01:36:57,600 --> 01:36:59,170
Papa!

1320
01:37:01,767 --> 01:37:03,769
Papam?

1321
01:37:36,534 --> 01:37:38,445
Head wind is to the East

1322
01:37:38,534 --> 01:37:40,172
Should we go opposite, Uncle?

1323
01:37:40,301 --> 01:37:42,144
It will turn now. Take it forward

1324
01:37:42,501 --> 01:37:43,844
<i>Let's not have a pooh
or anything this time</i>

1325
01:37:44,201 --> 01:37:46,203
We did all that last time Yes

1326
01:37:46,267 --> 01:37:48,577
First let's get it
off the ground. Pappa?

1327
01:37:48,867 --> 01:37:50,869
Let's get on Ok

1328
01:37:55,800 --> 01:37:58,144
When he goes full throttle,
remove the stoppers under the wheel

1329
01:37:58,501 --> 01:38:00,503
Do everything
exactly like last time

1330
01:38:01,067 --> 01:38:03,069
Gesture when it's time
to remove the stopper

1331
01:38:03,200 --> 01:38:05,202
What? I said to gesture
when you're ready

1332
01:38:05,267 --> 01:38:07,269
-ol<
-ol<

1333
01:38:22,601 --> 01:38:24,603
Alright

1334
01:38:26,734 --> 01:38:28,736
Need a little push?

1335
01:38:40,334 --> 01:38:43,747
Go straight ahead! Yes!

1336
01:40:04,167 --> 01:40:07,705
Noufal! Look there! When
did they drag this up?

1337
01:40:08,034 --> 01:40:09,377
How come they didn't call us?

1338
01:40:09,434 --> 01:40:13,143
It's up! Venkidi's plane is
flying! Look, it's heading this way!

1339
01:40:18,634 --> 01:40:20,511
What's that sound?

1340
01:40:28,667 --> 01:40:32,342
Didn't you say you did something
last night? And now look!

1341
01:40:33,234 --> 01:40:35,236
Oh no!

1342
01:40:50,701 --> 01:40:56,174
Come on! Look! Sister!
It's flying! See?

1343
01:40:57,168 --> 01:41:01,378
Upon the clouds, to resounding
thunder, He shall appear...

1344
01:41:01,567 --> 01:41:04,480
...and all shall
leave their homes...

1345
01:41:04,634 --> 01:41:08,343
...to gather together to see Him

1346
01:42:01,567 --> 01:42:03,569
Teacher! Look at Venkidi!

1347
01:43:12,767 --> 01:43:14,769
Move closer to the shore

1348
01:43:18,201 --> 01:43:20,203
Now try to land it...
doesn't matter where

1349
01:43:20,434 --> 01:43:22,311
Not in the water!

1350
01:43:36,400 --> 01:43:38,402
Hey! Come on! Come on!

1351
01:43:38,734 --> 01:43:40,736
Come on out!

1352
01:43:40,801 --> 01:43:42,803
You flew! And we all saw it!

1353
01:43:42,867 --> 01:43:44,904
Everyone saw! Wow!

1354
01:44:00,934 --> 01:44:02,936
Move away, boy! Stop pushing! Move!

1355
01:44:03,234 --> 01:44:05,236
Sister, will we get to fly too?

1356
01:44:05,701 --> 01:44:07,408
You know how high it flies?

1357
01:44:07,701 --> 01:44:09,703
We flew, Mother!

1358
01:44:09,967 --> 01:44:11,969
Our plane flew! My son...

1359
01:44:12,700 --> 01:44:15,078
...I saw. We all did

1360
01:44:20,300 --> 01:44:24,248
I wasn't wrong about you

1361
01:44:24,700 --> 01:44:26,737
I...made the plane, Sir!

1362
01:44:27,167 --> 01:44:29,738
A plane that can fly! That's it!

1363
01:44:31,667 --> 01:44:33,669
I will not let you off anymore

1364
01:44:35,101 --> 01:44:38,275
I heard there was an accident when
you landed. Hope everything is fine

1365
01:44:38,834 --> 01:44:41,815
it was no accident.
It was intentional

1366
01:44:42,301 --> 01:44:44,303
Intentional?

1367
01:44:44,401 --> 01:44:45,744
Who would do that?

1368
01:44:45,900 --> 01:44:48,278
OK, Ok Will this do?

1369
01:44:48,401 --> 01:44:50,403
Tuck your tummy in

1370
01:44:52,734 --> 01:44:54,736
Smile! Smile!

1371
01:44:55,101 --> 01:44:57,047
A little to the left...
Sugunetta*... (Brother Sugunan)

1372
01:44:57,167 --> 01:44:58,976
Kid! No!

1373
01:44:59,100 --> 01:45:01,205
Don't be so agitated.
We will find a way

1374
01:45:01,734 --> 01:45:03,941
She is floating ever
since she saw him fly

1375
01:45:04,167 --> 01:45:06,306
We will fix him, I promise

1376
01:45:06,900 --> 01:45:09,779
Are we ready to begin?
I am suffocating!

1377
01:45:14,200 --> 01:45:16,202
You've moved from position!

1378
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:19,707
Make your smile more enigmatic

1379
01:45:19,834 --> 01:45:21,836
What? Do whatever you like

1380
01:45:23,301 --> 01:45:26,111
Alright, smile...don't move...

1381
01:45:26,301 --> 01:45:29,771
Stand still. Kid! Didn't I
tell you I would be right there?

1382
01:45:30,700 --> 01:45:32,270
Oh God!

1383
01:45:32,368 --> 01:45:35,144
Where is the other one? You think you
can just flex your muscles at anyone?

1384
01:45:35,667 --> 01:45:37,669
I won't spare either one of you!

1385
01:45:37,767 --> 01:45:39,769
Venkidi! No physical stuff! No!

1386
01:45:39,967 --> 01:45:43,210
You, you! My studio is not
the place for hooliganism

1387
01:45:43,267 --> 01:45:45,213
Listen! If you hurt me,
I can be nasty!

1388
01:45:45,334 --> 01:45:47,336
You are already nasty!
You don't have to specify

1389
01:45:48,367 --> 01:45:49,971
And you have nasty creatures
to hang out with, too

1390
01:45:50,067 --> 01:45:52,069
Was it you, or he who dropped
this at my house last night?

1391
01:45:52,200 --> 01:45:54,373
When you were on your bastardly mission,
you didn't realise you dropped this

1392
01:45:54,734 --> 01:45:56,338
You dog!

1393
01:45:56,634 --> 01:45:58,636
You thought I would die
out there, didn't you?

1394
01:45:58,967 --> 01:46:00,969
Once...at least once...

1395
01:46:01,067 --> 01:46:03,206
...she and I will fly together.

1396
01:46:03,367 --> 01:46:05,369
Only then will I die

1397
01:46:23,234 --> 01:46:25,236
Wait, wait! I am
back from flying...

1398
01:46:25,867 --> 01:46:27,869
...don't you want to see if
I got all that you wanted?

1399
01:46:28,134 --> 01:46:30,136
Hmm

1400
01:46:30,801 --> 01:46:34,943
For the princess to trim her
nails, the edge of a star...

1401
01:46:36,900 --> 01:46:39,312
...a piece of a cottony cloud...

1402
01:46:43,034 --> 01:46:46,038
...the murmer of the wind!

1403
01:46:50,033 --> 01:46:53,310
Wasn't there one
more? I missed that!

1404
01:46:56,734 --> 01:46:58,680
The baby rabbit on the moon!

1405
01:46:58,967 --> 01:47:01,538
Forgot, didn't you?

1406
01:47:01,634 --> 01:47:04,205
That I forgot!

1407
01:47:26,601 --> 01:47:29,013
We flew! We flew!

1408
01:47:30,667 --> 01:47:32,112
Our plane flew!

1409
01:47:32,800 --> 01:47:34,802
Right, Venkidi?

1410
01:47:35,234 --> 01:47:39,842
And now? Shouldn't we fly together?

1411
01:47:40,034 --> 01:47:44,107
Isn't that why I went
to all this trouble?

1412
01:47:51,634 --> 01:47:53,238
We should

1413
01:47:53,667 --> 01:47:55,271
We have to fly together

1414
01:47:55,667 --> 01:47:59,479
But how can you come? If
your father comes to know...

1415
01:48:00,467 --> 01:48:02,469
The tickets are ready for next week

1416
01:48:03,167 --> 01:48:05,169
No one is listening to me

1417
01:48:06,167 --> 01:48:08,977
lfl leave, I doubt
I can ever come back

1418
01:48:09,801 --> 01:48:13,681
What does your mother say?

1419
01:48:14,600 --> 01:48:16,602
She also says I have to go

1420
01:48:17,034 --> 01:48:18,911
I begged...l starved...

1421
01:48:24,134 --> 01:48:26,136
There's only one way out

1422
01:48:28,467 --> 01:48:30,913
Tomorrow...l will somehow slip out

1423
01:48:31,967 --> 01:48:33,878
We should fly together

1424
01:48:33,967 --> 01:48:36,470
For as long as we
want...and then...

1425
01:48:37,234 --> 01:48:39,236
...let us crashland somewhere...

1426
01:48:39,700 --> 01:48:43,045
...and die...together...

1427
01:48:47,634 --> 01:48:50,945
Yes...at least once...

1428
01:48:51,034 --> 01:48:53,036
...we should fly together

1429
01:48:54,234 --> 01:48:56,908
And then...

1430
01:48:58,934 --> 01:49:00,936
...let it be as it may

1431
01:49:10,567 --> 01:49:12,171
There was nothing
there to get tangled in

1432
01:49:12,501 --> 01:49:14,503
Do you think the tide
dragged something in?

1433
01:49:14,700 --> 01:49:16,702
Move it around and pull

1434
01:49:18,401 --> 01:49:21,541
Still stuck? I don't know what
it is. But it is stuck hard

1435
01:49:22,534 --> 01:49:25,071
lfl pull harder, it will
break I will go down and check

1436
01:49:35,801 --> 01:49:38,714
It's a car! Stuck down there

1437
01:49:47,001 --> 01:49:49,003
Pull!

1438
01:49:49,167 --> 01:49:51,169
Pull harder!

1439
01:49:51,601 --> 01:49:54,138
Move people aside! Move away

1440
01:50:03,334 --> 01:50:05,336
This is that very car!

1441
01:50:21,034 --> 01:50:23,036
It is bruised

1442
01:50:25,100 --> 01:50:27,102
It must hurt real bad!

1443
01:50:27,734 --> 01:50:29,736
Imagine that!

1444
01:50:30,067 --> 01:50:32,707
When you wear these
shades, no one will know

1445
01:50:32,967 --> 01:50:34,640
That's true! But...

1446
01:50:34,767 --> 01:50:37,577
...to say that Venkidi hit
you for no reason at all...

1447
01:50:37,767 --> 01:50:39,371
...it's difficult to believe

1448
01:50:39,467 --> 01:50:41,413
And didn't you say
anything at home?

1449
01:50:41,501 --> 01:50:44,778
If he says anything at home,
Janaki will come to know

1450
01:50:45,834 --> 01:50:47,370
And that looks bad for you, right?

1451
01:50:47,434 --> 01:50:49,436
I know you are all on his side!

1452
01:50:49,734 --> 01:50:51,736
I will get him someday. Watch!

1453
01:50:52,534 --> 01:50:56,038
My big brother is in the papers! And
his plane too! Give it here! Let me look!

1454
01:50:56,334 --> 01:50:58,280
There! On the second page

1455
01:51:00,600 --> 01:51:01,772
There is a picture and everything!

1456
01:51:01,834 --> 01:51:03,313
Where, where? Read it aloud!

1457
01:51:03,401 --> 01:51:06,939
Venketeshwaran, who has only
school-level education...

1458
01:51:07,367 --> 01:51:09,870
...struggled for a long
time to shape this...

1459
01:51:09,967 --> 01:51:12,948
...small plane that falls
into the ultra-light category

1460
01:51:13,967 --> 01:51:16,379
He modelled the engine...

1461
01:51:16,467 --> 01:51:19,676
...on the internationally
famous half-Volkswagen model...

1462
01:51:19,734 --> 01:51:23,272
...to power the propellor

1463
01:51:23,334 --> 01:51:27,510
The car engine used in his
plane was sourced locally

1464
01:51:27,567 --> 01:51:29,945
Including the propellor
that was crafted in wood...

1465
01:51:30,334 --> 01:51:33,315
...the mechanical
parts and body parts...

1466
01:51:33,367 --> 01:51:35,278
...and most of the items
used in the construction...

1467
01:51:35,367 --> 01:51:37,278
...was personally
manufactured by him

1468
01:51:37,334 --> 01:51:39,439
Volkswagen engine indeed! Give
me that! What's the matter?

1469
01:51:41,867 --> 01:51:45,610
Uncle and nephew steal a car
and then pose for the papers?

1470
01:51:45,934 --> 01:51:47,845
Give me my paper!

1471
01:51:48,034 --> 01:51:49,809
Your big brother will be in
the papers tomorrow as well

1472
01:51:49,901 --> 01:51:51,903
The Police will make sure
of that. Let this be with me

1473
01:52:00,901 --> 01:52:02,903
Who is that, Mother? Oh no!

1474
01:52:06,867 --> 01:52:08,778
You...! You...!

1475
01:52:08,834 --> 01:52:11,440
Move! Oh no! They
are hurting him...

1476
01:52:13,634 --> 01:52:15,636
Where did you steal
this from? Speak!

1477
01:52:15,767 --> 01:52:17,769
Speak up!

1478
01:52:17,867 --> 01:52:21,314
Don't beat him up, Sir, please!
He thought know one would know

1479
01:52:21,367 --> 01:52:23,711
I will make you speak! Move here!

1480
01:52:23,834 --> 01:52:26,713
My son won't steal! Please don't
beat him up! He won't steal?

1481
01:52:26,834 --> 01:52:29,906
So where did he get a motor
engine to play with his little fan?

1482
01:52:30,567 --> 01:52:33,605
Come on over here!
Get into the jeep!

1483
01:52:34,334 --> 01:52:35,870
Get him into the jeep!

1484
01:52:35,967 --> 01:52:38,948
And we somehow need to drag
this thing to the Station too!

1485
01:52:39,301 --> 01:52:41,303
It is evidence

1486
01:52:44,534 --> 01:52:46,810
This is no petty case, Father

1487
01:52:46,900 --> 01:52:48,902
It is car theft!

1488
01:52:49,201 --> 01:52:50,771
And he has confessed to it

1489
01:52:50,901 --> 01:52:52,710
He says he did this alone.

1490
01:52:52,800 --> 01:52:55,371
But I know, this was
not a single man's job

1491
01:52:55,501 --> 01:52:58,539
Tonight, I will make
him spill out the rest

1492
01:52:59,134 --> 01:53:01,239
Please do not hurt him

1493
01:53:02,600 --> 01:53:04,602
He is no thief or murderer

1494
01:53:05,367 --> 01:53:08,143
He made an error this one time

1495
01:53:08,468 --> 01:53:10,470
Stealing is wrong, we agree

1496
01:53:11,500 --> 01:53:14,538
But he did not sell it or anything

1497
01:53:15,201 --> 01:53:17,909
The plane he made with
it...you saw it too

1498
01:53:18,334 --> 01:53:20,314
What plane, Teacher?

1499
01:53:20,434 --> 01:53:23,278
If you steal, you're a thief.
That's the law as I know it

1500
01:53:23,367 --> 01:53:26,246
You're going by the rules? Then how
come you beat him black and blue?

1501
01:53:26,267 --> 01:53:28,304
How dare you! We
are not here to argue

1502
01:53:28,334 --> 01:53:30,143
Father, I...

1503
01:53:30,300 --> 01:53:32,405
This is about a young man's future

1504
01:53:32,734 --> 01:53:36,841
This needs to end here. What can we do
for that? That's what we need to know Yes

1505
01:53:37,267 --> 01:53:41,477
This young man is also affecting
the future of certain young women

1506
01:53:41,634 --> 01:53:45,446
You know that. If this involved
anyone else, I could have helped

1507
01:53:45,600 --> 01:53:49,309
But this is not like that.
Lawyer Govindan is very determined

1508
01:53:49,567 --> 01:53:53,140
Sir... we will repair
the car as good as new

1509
01:53:53,634 --> 01:53:55,443
And pay compensation too

1510
01:53:55,567 --> 01:53:57,513
But I am not the one who can decide

1511
01:53:58,267 --> 01:54:00,110
You go and meet the lawyer

1512
01:54:00,200 --> 01:54:02,237
If he agrees, I'll
take care of the rest

1513
01:54:02,501 --> 01:54:04,708
Or else get bail from
the Court in two days time

1514
01:54:06,068 --> 01:54:09,174
Now you can leave.
That's all I have to say

1515
01:54:12,267 --> 01:54:14,269
Alright then, Sir

1516
01:54:15,301 --> 01:54:17,303
Can I meet him for a minute?

1517
01:54:17,367 --> 01:54:19,779
I need to tell him something
- Ok. Make it fast

1518
01:54:28,601 --> 01:54:30,603
Janaki leaves tomorrow

1519
01:54:33,601 --> 01:54:36,138
I heard she agreed to go

1520
01:54:36,834 --> 01:54:38,836
I want to see her

1521
01:54:39,134 --> 01:54:41,808
If I tell her to, she will stay

1522
01:54:42,100 --> 01:54:44,102
You heard what he said

1523
01:54:44,401 --> 01:54:46,403
You can only get bail
from the Court in two days

1524
01:54:48,134 --> 01:54:51,547
The lawyer wants to make sure
you stay inside for two days

1525
01:54:53,500 --> 01:54:55,502
That's enough of secrets.

1526
01:54:55,634 --> 01:54:57,443
Come away!

1527
01:55:13,367 --> 01:55:16,041
Losing a car is
nothing to him. Nothing.

1528
01:55:16,334 --> 01:55:18,336
He will buy 9 more if he wants to!

1529
01:55:18,467 --> 01:55:21,073
Tomorrow, if he sets his mind to it.
The issue is not about the car

1530
01:55:21,401 --> 01:55:23,506
He needs to be locked up!

1531
01:55:24,401 --> 01:55:26,278
At least for 5 or 6 years

1532
01:55:26,334 --> 01:55:28,336
The lawyer has ensured
that will happen

1533
01:55:28,534 --> 01:55:32,209
Car theft... the murder
attempt on me and Anandan

1534
01:55:32,501 --> 01:55:36,176
And besides that, any case that
remains unsolved in this region...

1535
01:55:36,267 --> 01:55:38,213
...will all be on him from now on!

1536
01:55:38,300 --> 01:55:40,007
He and his bloody plane!

1537
01:55:40,067 --> 01:55:42,069
And you come on behalf of a thief?

1538
01:55:43,034 --> 01:55:44,741
Would any dignified
person set out for this?

1539
01:55:45,034 --> 01:55:47,036
We agree with the facts

1540
01:55:47,734 --> 01:55:51,045
We will repair your car.
And he will apologise

1541
01:55:52,067 --> 01:55:54,377
Don't use this as an
excuse for personal vendetta

1542
01:55:55,500 --> 01:55:57,411
Be large hearted enough for that

1543
01:55:57,500 --> 01:55:59,776
You want me to be
large hearted? And him?

1544
01:56:00,301 --> 01:56:03,407
He will take the hand of my
daughter who is engaged to another...

1545
01:56:03,534 --> 01:56:04,604
...and I should meekly watch?

1546
01:56:04,668 --> 01:56:06,614
I don't want to abuse
people in my own home.

1547
01:56:06,701 --> 01:56:08,544
So I will refrain
from responding to you

1548
01:56:09,267 --> 01:56:11,269
I won't say it was unintentional

1549
01:56:11,667 --> 01:56:13,669
It was fully intended

1550
01:56:15,067 --> 01:56:17,069
He would have done anything...

1551
01:56:17,200 --> 01:56:19,146
...to get it to fly

1552
01:56:19,267 --> 01:56:21,042
This was the only way before him

1553
01:56:21,134 --> 01:56:24,274
At least it was a good
way to get him behind bars

1554
01:56:24,534 --> 01:56:26,536
He will be of no
nuisance to anyone anymore

1555
01:56:26,767 --> 01:56:29,270
Balaji here has
made arrangements...

1556
01:56:29,301 --> 01:56:31,303
...for him to continue
his studies in Delhi

1557
01:56:32,167 --> 01:56:34,169
Just don't put
unrelated cases on him

1558
01:56:34,367 --> 01:56:37,348
Let him go and we will
take care of the rest

1559
01:56:37,634 --> 01:56:40,080
You don't have to take
care of anything. I will!

1560
01:56:40,501 --> 01:56:42,276
This is the decision for this case

1561
01:56:42,367 --> 01:56:44,711
He will be behind bars
and she will go to study...

1562
01:56:45,067 --> 01:56:46,512
...in Singapore

1563
01:56:46,600 --> 01:56:48,238
And she will marry Anandan

1564
01:56:48,300 --> 01:56:52,077
His plane will rust
in the Police Station

1565
01:56:52,734 --> 01:56:54,577
And every time I pass that way...

1566
01:56:54,634 --> 01:56:56,671
...I will spit on it!

1567
01:57:04,567 --> 01:57:06,569
So I suppose this
gathering is dismissed?

1568
01:57:07,267 --> 01:57:09,543
I don't know about you guys
but we have other work to do

1569
01:57:13,167 --> 01:57:15,169
Janaki! Open the door!

1570
01:57:17,001 --> 01:57:18,708
I said open the door!

1571
01:57:19,701 --> 01:57:22,147
I was the one who told
him to take the damned car

1572
01:57:22,567 --> 01:57:24,444
I opened the gate for him

1573
01:57:24,567 --> 01:57:26,569
And got the key from
the cupboard for him

1574
01:57:26,667 --> 01:57:28,669
If this was theft,
I was part of it too

1575
01:57:29,401 --> 01:57:31,108
Let the Police arrest me too.

1576
01:57:31,167 --> 01:57:33,943
I will tell everyone
everything, including the Police

1577
01:57:34,300 --> 01:57:36,177
My Venkidi is not a thief

1578
01:57:36,234 --> 01:57:38,646
It was me. I forced him to do it

1579
01:57:45,234 --> 01:57:47,236
You will not say anything to anyone

1580
01:57:47,501 --> 01:57:49,503
And if you do, no one
will take it seriously

1581
01:57:49,601 --> 01:57:52,309
So...just listen to
your father, my child

1582
01:57:53,067 --> 01:57:54,546
Your ticket is ready for tomorrow

1583
01:57:54,634 --> 01:57:56,545
And your bags are also packed

1584
01:57:56,634 --> 01:58:00,480
Sekharan, Rema and Anandan should not get
the feeling that you are being forced to go

1585
01:58:01,101 --> 01:58:03,172
They are your family now

1586
01:58:03,900 --> 01:58:07,109
Despite knowing all of this,
they love you just like before

1587
01:58:07,367 --> 01:58:08,641
That's no small thing

1588
01:58:09,434 --> 01:58:11,436
It won't happen as
long as I am alive

1589
01:58:12,101 --> 01:58:13,478
I have to be alive
for them to love me!

1590
01:58:13,567 --> 01:58:15,569
When the Priest and the
Teacher came to speak for him...

1591
01:58:15,634 --> 01:58:18,012
...you must have
heard what they said

1592
01:58:18,300 --> 01:58:20,143
I won't stand against any of it

1593
01:58:20,234 --> 01:58:23,147
In two days, I will ask
the Police to let him go

1594
01:58:23,400 --> 01:58:25,311
Only if you do as you are told...

1595
01:58:25,401 --> 01:58:27,403
...without a word to anyone...

1596
01:58:27,501 --> 01:58:29,503
...without trying any more tricks

1597
01:58:30,267 --> 01:58:32,144
They should feel...

1598
01:58:32,201 --> 01:58:33,976
...that you are going willingly

1599
01:58:34,034 --> 01:58:35,536
If not...

1600
01:58:35,867 --> 01:58:37,869
...he won't see the
light of day again

1601
01:58:55,601 --> 01:58:58,582
ls the sky going farther?

1602
01:58:59,300 --> 01:59:02,543
Is the darkness
enveloping everything?

1603
01:59:03,100 --> 01:59:06,309
Like a dark rain cloud...

1604
01:59:06,868 --> 01:59:09,872
...are my hopes dissolving?

1605
01:59:10,434 --> 01:59:13,415
What falls and disappears...

1606
01:59:13,467 --> 01:59:16,505
...are my lonely, silent desires

1607
01:59:17,968 --> 01:59:20,881
And like a poor nightingale...

1608
01:59:20,967 --> 01:59:24,176
...they sigh in the night

1609
01:59:25,134 --> 01:59:27,080
To rise again

1610
01:59:27,100 --> 01:59:28,943
To sing and soar free

1611
01:59:29,001 --> 01:59:31,880
Who would lend them wings?

1612
01:59:32,468 --> 01:59:34,414
To rise again...

1613
01:59:34,434 --> 01:59:36,436
To sing and soar free

1614
01:59:36,534 --> 01:59:39,014
Who would lend them wings?

1615
01:59:40,034 --> 01:59:42,844
Is the sky going farther?

1616
01:59:43,834 --> 01:59:46,474
Is the darkness
enveloping everything?

1617
01:59:47,401 --> 01:59:50,541
Like a dark rain cloud...

1618
01:59:51,134 --> 01:59:54,343
Are my hopes dissolving?

1619
02:00:08,867 --> 02:00:12,212
Close, so close to me...

1620
02:00:12,467 --> 02:00:16,381
The feeling is just an illusion

1621
02:00:16,434 --> 02:00:19,779
Far, so far from me

1622
02:00:20,367 --> 02:00:23,871
ls the world of the skies

1623
02:00:24,301 --> 02:00:27,771
Like a sharpened arrow...

1624
02:00:27,901 --> 02:00:30,939
desires fly far

1625
02:00:31,800 --> 02:00:35,077
And they fall...

1626
02:00:35,334 --> 02:00:38,213
Like a battered insect in the rain

1627
02:01:01,967 --> 02:01:03,674
Sir? Hmm?

1628
02:01:03,800 --> 02:01:06,110
It's rice and curry...can
we give it to him?

1629
02:01:06,367 --> 02:01:08,369
Do you need to go in?
I can take it to him

1630
02:01:08,767 --> 02:01:10,769
We would like to meet him too

1631
02:01:11,200 --> 02:01:13,146
The Inspector is not
here so I guess it's ok

1632
02:01:13,200 --> 02:01:15,202
Go on Ok. Come

1633
02:01:22,334 --> 02:01:24,075
Venkidi

1634
02:01:26,167 --> 02:01:28,670
Look...your lunch

1635
02:01:29,100 --> 02:01:30,807
lam not hungry

1636
02:01:30,901 --> 02:01:32,847
You've had nothing since yesterday

1637
02:01:32,900 --> 02:01:34,902
Come and take this

1638
02:01:36,667 --> 02:01:37,907
Come on!

1639
02:01:39,101 --> 02:01:41,240
Heard from Janaki?

1640
02:01:42,067 --> 02:01:44,069
Where is she now?

1641
02:01:44,934 --> 02:01:46,971
Her flight is at 3

1642
02:01:47,667 --> 02:01:49,669
I saw the car leave for the airport

1643
02:01:50,201 --> 02:01:52,203
They must have reached there

1644
02:01:52,734 --> 02:01:55,237
Even if one of us goes
to try and talk to her...

1645
02:01:55,701 --> 02:01:57,237
...it won't work

1646
02:01:57,634 --> 02:01:59,113
There is only half an hour left

1647
02:01:59,234 --> 02:02:01,236
She would have boarded
her flight by then

1648
02:02:08,067 --> 02:02:09,637
Aren't you ready to leave yet?

1649
02:02:09,734 --> 02:02:11,338
Sir, he needs to relieve himself

1650
02:02:11,634 --> 02:02:13,307
He was shy to ask

1651
02:02:13,634 --> 02:02:15,079
How can he eat?

1652
02:02:15,134 --> 02:02:17,136
Soman! Open the door for him

1653
02:02:32,967 --> 02:02:35,846
Don't touch him! Move away!
Push it to the road!

1654
02:02:36,267 --> 02:02:38,269
I said, move! Move!

1655
02:02:38,901 --> 02:02:40,903
Leave! Go fast! Move!

1656
02:02:41,934 --> 02:02:43,936
Push it to the road! Push!

1657
02:02:45,067 --> 02:02:47,069
Move away!

1658
02:02:48,101 --> 02:02:50,103
Get him!

1659
02:02:51,334 --> 02:02:53,336
I will take care of them! You push!

1660
02:02:57,634 --> 02:02:59,636
You go now! Go on!

1661
02:03:02,201 --> 02:03:04,203
Don't touch him! I'll kill you!

1662
02:03:05,534 --> 02:03:07,536
Come on!

1663
02:03:10,167 --> 02:03:12,909
Leave, quickly! Go!

1664
02:03:14,934 --> 02:03:17,744
Venkidi, fly! I will
take care of these guys!

1665
02:03:53,967 --> 02:03:55,969
Get down, child

1666
02:04:08,734 --> 02:04:11,112
Where's the passport?

1667
02:04:11,234 --> 02:04:13,908
Thank you, Sir Thank you.
Dad, I will be in the lounge

1668
02:04:35,667 --> 02:04:37,669
Venkidi!

1669
02:04:46,134 --> 02:04:48,136
Fire Station Tower,
unknown glider, private...

1670
02:04:48,501 --> 02:04:49,707
...trying to make an
approach into the airport.

1671
02:04:49,767 --> 02:04:51,644
Proceed immediately
and take position

1672
02:04:58,434 --> 02:05:00,436
Oh no! Venkidi!

1673
02:05:01,134 --> 02:05:03,136
Venkidi!

1674
02:05:07,567 --> 02:05:09,569
My girl! Venkidi!

1675
02:05:23,401 --> 02:05:25,403
Child! No! Let me go!

1676
02:05:25,567 --> 02:05:27,877
Leave me! I need to go! No!

1677
02:05:51,934 --> 02:05:54,414
Venkidi! Let me go!
No! No, my girl!

1678
02:05:54,701 --> 02:05:56,874
Venkidi! Come away! Come on!

1679
02:05:57,000 --> 02:05:59,446
Let me just see him, please No!

1680
02:05:59,667 --> 02:06:01,669
Venkidi!

1681
02:06:01,901 --> 02:06:03,676
Let go!

1682
02:06:05,467 --> 02:06:07,469
Come away, child! Venkidi!

1683
02:06:07,700 --> 02:06:09,702
Let me see him, please!

1684
02:06:49,434 --> 02:06:54,110
There's a leak here...that's
why there is so much smoke

1685
02:06:54,967 --> 02:06:56,913
Let's close the leak, ok? Ok

1686
02:06:57,068 --> 02:06:59,742
Watch! ok

1687
02:07:13,034 --> 02:07:15,036
When you hold it, don't touch here

1688
02:07:15,368 --> 02:07:18,941
Without opening it, the
flame should be lit underneath

1689
02:07:19,067 --> 02:07:21,843
it will work, for sure.
Let me tighten it a bit more

1690
02:07:28,367 --> 02:07:29,903
Uncle Murugan!

1691
02:07:30,434 --> 02:07:32,436
Venkidi! Son!

1692
02:07:34,434 --> 02:07:36,436
Jayan! See who is here!

1693
02:07:36,567 --> 02:07:38,513
You didn't even call!

1694
02:07:38,634 --> 02:07:40,375
You should have seen
the fuss here yesterday

1695
02:07:40,434 --> 02:07:42,038
Everyone together
in front of the

1696
02:07:42,367 --> 02:07:43,869
Everyone asked if you would come

1697
02:07:44,001 --> 02:07:47,107
I didn't say anything. But
this one was talking to everyone

1698
02:07:47,500 --> 02:07:50,538
I wanted to quietly come and go

1699
02:07:50,801 --> 02:07:53,839
Anyway let's not stay here.
Let's go home

1700
02:07:54,367 --> 02:07:56,677
Jayan! Close up and come home

1701
02:07:56,801 --> 02:07:58,303
We'll be there

1702
02:07:58,501 --> 02:08:00,276
We'll go home...

1703
02:08:00,401 --> 02:08:02,039
...but before that...

1704
02:08:02,400 --> 02:08:04,402
...there's someone we need to see

1705
02:08:04,634 --> 02:08:06,841
Mable has been living
here for a long time now

1706
02:08:07,667 --> 02:08:10,944
She teaches the kids in the
orphanage stitching and embroidery

1707
02:08:11,268 --> 02:08:13,544
She used to, before
too...you know that

1708
02:08:14,034 --> 02:08:16,014
When Roger died...

1709
02:08:16,334 --> 02:08:17,608
...it became difficult
for her to go up and down

1710
02:08:17,701 --> 02:08:19,408
Besides she was alone at home too

1711
02:08:19,601 --> 02:08:21,603
She moved in here with the kids

1712
02:08:22,601 --> 02:08:24,444
I didn't know that

1713
02:08:24,634 --> 02:08:26,875
So the postal address
must have changed too

1714
02:08:27,734 --> 02:08:29,509
It's a small town

1715
02:08:29,700 --> 02:08:31,407
Everyone knows everyone

1716
02:08:31,634 --> 02:08:33,614
The money order you send her...

1717
02:08:33,734 --> 02:08:36,340
...she spends on the children here

1718
02:08:47,401 --> 02:08:49,711
You have a guest, Teacher

1719
02:08:49,967 --> 02:08:51,969
Who?

1720
02:08:56,534 --> 02:08:58,536
Venkidi, isn't it?

1721
02:09:00,500 --> 02:09:04,505
No! It is Padmabhushan
Prof. Venketeshwaran now!

1722
02:09:04,700 --> 02:09:06,702
Right?

1723
02:09:11,834 --> 02:09:14,815
It is Pappa's death
anniversary, isn't it? Yes

1724
02:09:15,567 --> 02:09:16,978
It is today

1725
02:09:17,467 --> 02:09:20,641
It was when Papa was in
hospital in the town...

1726
02:09:20,867 --> 02:09:22,710
...that you came last?

1727
02:09:22,867 --> 02:09:24,869
That was when I saw you last

1728
02:09:25,334 --> 02:09:27,336
It's been 22 years, right? Yes

1729
02:09:27,967 --> 02:09:31,471
He came then. And the same
year again when his mother died

1730
02:09:31,934 --> 02:09:33,936
And then only now

1731
02:09:35,667 --> 02:09:37,669
I've been busy

1732
02:09:37,901 --> 02:09:39,676
There was no time

1733
02:09:40,834 --> 02:09:42,836
No... you just gave it all up

1734
02:09:44,334 --> 02:09:46,280
And Janaki was just as obstinate!

1735
02:09:46,567 --> 02:09:48,569
She didn't even come
when her parents died

1736
02:09:49,334 --> 02:09:51,336
But I think she is here now

1737
02:09:51,767 --> 02:09:53,474
Did you know?

1738
02:09:53,701 --> 02:09:56,204
Yes. I did

1739
02:09:56,734 --> 02:09:58,736
She is unwell, isn't she?

1740
02:10:00,534 --> 02:10:02,536
That's what I heard

1741
02:10:03,901 --> 02:10:06,142
Aren't you going to see her?

1742
02:10:08,201 --> 02:10:10,203
I might...

1743
02:10:10,367 --> 02:10:13,644
...just leave. I may not see her

1744
02:10:17,267 --> 02:10:19,406
You come over to the Church.
I have a class now

1745
02:10:19,567 --> 02:10:21,274
There are kids from outside

1746
02:10:21,534 --> 02:10:23,536
I'll be here for two days

1747
02:10:23,634 --> 02:10:25,636
I'll come by again. - Ok

1748
02:10:45,467 --> 02:10:46,878
Were you going to bed?

1749
02:10:47,200 --> 02:10:48,406
<i>No</i>

1750
02:10:53,267 --> 02:10:56,407
Your mother was always
worried about you

1751
02:10:57,201 --> 02:10:59,772
How you would turn out...what
your future would be like

1752
02:11:01,101 --> 02:11:03,103
She didn't live long
enough to see all this

1753
02:11:04,200 --> 02:11:06,646
With the police case relating
to the airport incident...

1754
02:11:07,234 --> 02:11:08,838
...and Govindan's influence...

1755
02:11:09,234 --> 02:11:12,408
...no one thought you
would ever be free again

1756
02:11:13,468 --> 02:11:15,072
When the cases were all settled...

1757
02:11:15,168 --> 02:11:17,170
...and Balaji took you to Delhi...

1758
02:11:17,534 --> 02:11:19,207
...and put you in college...

1759
02:11:19,301 --> 02:11:21,303
...that was when
Sister was relieved

1760
02:11:22,401 --> 02:11:24,244
Then all she wanted was that...

1761
02:11:24,334 --> 02:11:26,336
...your attention
be not diverted...

1762
02:11:26,434 --> 02:11:28,436
...by anything here

1763
02:11:29,501 --> 02:11:31,811
That is why she kept
these hidden from you

1764
02:11:32,700 --> 02:11:34,577
I knew about it too

1765
02:11:34,734 --> 02:11:36,475
But I couldn't tell you either

1766
02:11:36,700 --> 02:11:39,146
When Sister died and the
house was demolished...

1767
02:11:40,134 --> 02:11:41,579
...I kept this safe

1768
02:11:41,734 --> 02:11:43,407
If you don't know about
this at least now...

1769
02:11:43,467 --> 02:11:45,469
...it will be a grave injustice

1770
02:11:46,567 --> 02:11:48,274
Not to my sister

1771
02:11:48,401 --> 02:11:50,403
...but to Janaki

1772
02:11:55,367 --> 02:11:58,473
Those are all letters Janaki
wrote you from Singapore

1773
02:12:31,600 --> 02:12:33,307
To, my Venkidi

1774
02:12:33,434 --> 02:12:36,040
I was crying so hard I fainted...

1775
02:12:36,134 --> 02:12:38,136
...as I boarded the flight

1776
02:12:38,567 --> 02:12:41,514
I don't even remember
landing or reaching here

1777
02:12:43,267 --> 02:12:45,269
They have enrolled me in college

1778
02:12:46,001 --> 02:12:48,003
I was crying as we went

1779
02:12:48,501 --> 02:12:50,503
We are so far apart...

1780
02:12:50,734 --> 02:12:52,736
...could I ever reach you if
I started running from here?

1781
02:12:55,334 --> 02:12:57,280
It is exam time in college

1782
02:12:57,501 --> 02:12:59,503
I am studying with a vengeance

1783
02:13:00,167 --> 02:13:01,669
If I get a job after my studies...

1784
02:13:01,934 --> 02:13:03,936
...I can get you here

1785
02:13:06,300 --> 02:13:10,009
Why...why won't you
even send me a reply?

1786
02:13:11,601 --> 02:13:13,603
Was it so easy for you
to forget me, Venkidi?

1787
02:13:14,367 --> 02:13:16,108
Even though I don't get
any reply from you...

1788
02:13:16,267 --> 02:13:18,269
...do you realise how many
letters I have written to you?

1789
02:13:19,534 --> 02:13:21,536
I am getting married
tomorrow, Venkidi

1790
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:24,241
My father and mother
got here yesterday

1791
02:13:25,334 --> 02:13:27,280
There's nothing I can do now...

1792
02:13:27,367 --> 02:13:30,541
You remember how I told you Janaki
is not supposed to board the Pushpak?

1793
02:13:31,400 --> 02:13:33,402
That is my fate

1794
02:13:35,001 --> 02:13:36,480
My marriage has ended...

1795
02:13:36,567 --> 02:13:38,569
...but I am not sad

1796
02:13:39,100 --> 02:13:41,102
In the days to come...

1797
02:13:41,267 --> 02:13:43,269
...I have my lovely
daughter to keep me company

1798
02:13:45,034 --> 02:13:47,344
She...is everything to me now

1799
02:13:50,034 --> 02:13:53,038
I don't know why I
keep writing to you

1800
02:13:54,201 --> 02:13:55,373
But...

1801
02:13:55,467 --> 02:13:58,175
...I like to believe you
are reading all of them

1802
02:13:59,401 --> 02:14:01,210
Most of my old beliefs...

1803
02:14:01,367 --> 02:14:03,870
...were wrong, is
what age has taught me

1804
02:14:08,367 --> 02:14:10,369
We had so many dreams...

1805
02:14:11,201 --> 02:14:13,203
...struggled so much!

1806
02:14:14,201 --> 02:14:16,112
Our plane...

1807
02:14:16,200 --> 02:14:18,202
...our skies!

1808
02:14:19,100 --> 02:14:21,102
I can't do this anymore, Venkidi!

1809
02:14:22,001 --> 02:14:24,982
Venkidi... are you listening?

1810
02:14:26,601 --> 02:14:28,603
Have you forgotten me?

1811
02:15:05,034 --> 02:15:07,036
Daughter!

1812
02:15:09,001 --> 02:15:10,947
What is it, Mother?

1813
02:15:11,034 --> 02:15:13,036
Look...there!

1814
02:15:43,501 --> 02:15:46,880
Mother? - Yes?
- There's a girl here

1815
02:15:47,034 --> 02:15:49,036
Is this Mr. Murugan's house?

1816
02:15:49,334 --> 02:15:51,336
Yes. I'll call him Ok

1817
02:15:51,534 --> 02:15:53,536
Father!

1818
02:15:53,900 --> 02:15:55,880
What's it, Daughter?
Someone's here to see you

1819
02:15:59,201 --> 02:16:01,203
Who is this, Daughter?

1820
02:16:01,401 --> 02:16:02,903
I am from around here

1821
02:16:03,034 --> 02:16:05,571
I wanted to know if Prof.
Venketeshwaran is here

1822
02:16:06,034 --> 02:16:08,036
Is he here? - Yes, he is

1823
02:16:08,234 --> 02:16:10,180
Who are you, child?

1824
02:16:10,367 --> 02:16:14,474
I am Janaki's daughter, Gauri
Mother sent me

1825
02:16:14,901 --> 02:16:16,574
Oh! Don't just stand there!

1826
02:16:16,867 --> 02:16:19,177
Come on in!
Venkidi is inside. I'll call him

1827
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:22,002
It's alright. I'll go in

1828
02:16:22,167 --> 02:16:24,909
But Grandpa, Uncle was
getting ready to go somewhere

1829
02:16:25,267 --> 02:16:27,440
He didn't say anything when I asked

1830
02:16:27,801 --> 02:16:29,803
Go straight in

1831
02:16:42,367 --> 02:16:44,369
May I come in, Sir?

1832
02:16:45,934 --> 02:16:47,971
Come

1833
02:16:50,034 --> 02:16:52,571
Gauri... Janaki's daughter

1834
02:16:53,167 --> 02:16:54,976
I'd spoken to you on the phone

1835
02:16:55,134 --> 02:16:57,114
Mother would like to see you

1836
02:16:59,367 --> 02:17:01,369
She can't walk

1837
02:17:01,501 --> 02:17:03,742
She is outside... in the car

1838
02:17:05,868 --> 02:17:07,848
I'll come

1839
02:17:51,767 --> 02:17:53,769
Venkidi...

1840
02:18:05,267 --> 02:18:07,247
Don't step out

1841
02:18:10,934 --> 02:18:12,743
I...

1842
02:18:13,434 --> 02:18:15,436
...can I drive?

1843
02:18:42,768 --> 02:18:45,214
Lovely place! Let
me take a look around

1844
02:18:55,667 --> 02:18:57,669
I thought...

1845
02:18:57,767 --> 02:18:59,769
...you had forgotten me

1846
02:18:59,934 --> 02:19:02,642
That's why...l...

1847
02:19:04,200 --> 02:19:06,200
But I was sure...

1848
02:19:06,201 --> 02:19:08,238
...you couldn't forget me

1849
02:19:08,601 --> 02:19:10,638
But my routes were all closed

1850
02:19:12,234 --> 02:19:13,907
They were made to close

1851
02:19:15,134 --> 02:19:17,136
The letters you wrote...

1852
02:19:19,134 --> 02:19:21,136
...I saw them only yesterday

1853
02:19:22,701 --> 02:19:24,681
If at least one had
made it to my hands...

1854
02:19:26,268 --> 02:19:28,305
Who hid them?

1855
02:19:29,901 --> 02:19:31,903
Who needed to do that?

1856
02:19:32,634 --> 02:19:34,636
It wasn't any one person

1857
02:19:35,668 --> 02:19:37,705
It was Fate

1858
02:19:38,300 --> 02:19:40,302
The same Fate...

1859
02:19:40,900 --> 02:19:43,107
...that arranged for
us to meet here today

1860
02:19:46,067 --> 02:19:48,104
Where is she? Gauri?

1861
02:19:48,867 --> 02:19:50,904
She...

1862
02:20:27,967 --> 02:20:30,971
The same old M-PET that was
rusting away in the Church yard

1863
02:20:32,134 --> 02:20:33,704
It is air-worthy now

1864
02:20:33,767 --> 02:20:35,769
But it took two days and two nights

1865
02:20:36,567 --> 02:20:38,569
The boys haven't slept!

1866
02:20:46,567 --> 02:20:48,569
Let me help you, Mother

1867
02:21:09,534 --> 02:21:12,674
M-PET... Magic Carpet...

1868
02:21:13,767 --> 02:21:15,769
Can Janaki board this, Venkidi?

1869
02:21:16,467 --> 02:21:17,673
Won't you?

1870
02:21:19,701 --> 02:21:20,873
Shouldn't we fly?
Together?

1871
02:22:36,867 --> 02:22:38,175
L...

1872
02:22:39,633 --> 02:22:41,806
Say nothing. Let's fly

1873
02:22:41,830 --> 02:22:49,830
