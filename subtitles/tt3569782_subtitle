1
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,380
Welcome sir

2
00:01:22,816 --> 00:01:25,536
Come, we were just waiting for you

3
00:01:38,197 --> 00:01:41,077
Karthik has sent you a gift

4
00:01:59,366 --> 00:02:01,566
It's over, he's dead

5
00:02:08,534 --> 00:02:11,614
'A few months before...'

6
00:02:18,782 --> 00:02:22,182
Hello, I'm out...
I'm coming in

7
00:02:34,622 --> 00:02:37,702
Hi viewers, welcome back to
'Start Camera, Action'

8
00:02:37,873 --> 00:02:41,993
Now we are in the semi-final round,
and things have gotten tougher

9
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,760
because every contestant
have created...

10
00:02:47,001 --> 00:02:51,081
...an unique short film of its kind
on a specific genre

11
00:02:51,331 --> 00:02:52,971
Just before the Ad-break

12
00:02:53,078 --> 00:02:56,438
We all enjoyed watching the short film
directed by our contestant Karthik

13
00:02:56,622 --> 00:02:59,662
Hey, where the hell you've been?
Quick, walk fast

14
00:02:59,956 --> 00:03:01,996
Don't stop, keep walking

15
00:03:02,124 --> 00:03:04,084
Keep moving man!

16
00:03:16,922 --> 00:03:19,242
Before the Ad-break we
watched your short film

17
00:03:19,376 --> 00:03:23,816
We have got 4 contestants in
this exciting semifinals

18
00:03:24,042 --> 00:03:27,162
And only three of them
can reach the finals

19
00:03:27,335 --> 00:03:29,255
One of the contestants
has to be eliminated

20
00:03:29,377 --> 00:03:33,097
So Karthik, how are you
feeling at this moment?

21
00:03:34,792 --> 00:03:38,112
Alright! I believe you are bit tensed

22
00:03:38,299 --> 00:03:42,379
Let's listen to the comments about
your film from our 2 esteemed judges

23
00:03:44,132 --> 00:03:47,732
National award winning director
- Mr Mukhil

24
00:03:49,671 --> 00:03:54,151
Blueberry Productions producer
- Mr Sundar

25
00:03:58,424 --> 00:04:01,704
Mukhil sir, your comments
on Karthik's film

26
00:04:38,222 --> 00:04:41,262
Rubbish movie

27
00:04:54,468 --> 00:04:57,388
'Cold Heart'

28
00:05:03,559 --> 00:05:05,919
Sundar sir, your comments please

29
00:05:07,018 --> 00:05:09,738
Out of all the films I watched here,

30
00:05:09,932 --> 00:05:11,452
This is the best!

31
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:20,150
It may look rubbish for
the experienced director,

32
00:05:20,352 --> 00:05:24,192
But for my eyes it looks great
This film is the best

33
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:31,670
Because of producers like you,
Our cinema industry is on it's downfall

34
00:05:32,019 --> 00:05:34,259
Because of directors like you...

35
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:37,874
commenting every movie as rubbish
is the reason for it's downfall

36
00:05:38,144 --> 00:05:40,744
But I'm not a fool like you

37
00:05:40,935 --> 00:05:43,815
I'm a fool to produce your movie

38
00:05:43,974 --> 00:05:45,894
Didn't you beg me
to make a movie?

39
00:05:46,065 --> 00:05:47,265
You keep quiet

40
00:05:47,648 --> 00:05:52,288
- Did I knock at your door for a chance?
- If talks anymore, you'll get my swears

41
00:05:52,566 --> 00:05:55,206
Sir, please let's talk and sort it out

42
00:05:55,443 --> 00:05:57,723
Sir, I didn't mean that way

43
00:05:57,861 --> 00:05:59,781
Wait for a while, sir

44
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,300
He's getting sacred of me

45
00:06:01,397 --> 00:06:03,237
How dare him call me a fool

46
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:06,190
Why the hell did you invite me?

47
00:06:06,318 --> 00:06:07,438
- Sir...
- Shut up

48
00:06:07,527 --> 00:06:09,087
Shut the camera!

49
00:06:10,899 --> 00:06:12,579
Sir, let's adjust and finish it off

50
00:06:12,731 --> 00:06:16,611
This argument is more than enough for
them to show case for 10 episodes

51
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,060
Why should I do this?

52
00:06:19,153 --> 00:06:21,513
You know very well
that he is an idiot

53
00:06:21,647 --> 00:06:23,447
Then why did you invite such an idiot?

54
00:06:23,563 --> 00:06:25,563
That lunatic is calling me a fool...

55
00:06:27,441 --> 00:06:29,001
You know very well
that he is an idiot

56
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:31,190
Then why did you invite such an idiot?

57
00:06:33,692 --> 00:06:36,652
If you can give your judgment,
we can wrap up the show

58
00:06:36,866 --> 00:06:38,106
Don't irritate me

59
00:06:38,236 --> 00:06:41,436
I came here because your boss invited me
But you insulted very well

60
00:06:41,611 --> 00:06:44,891
Ask him to tell the judgment

61
00:06:45,116 --> 00:06:48,716
If you can give your judgment,
we can wrap up the show

62
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:54,090
I'll give my judgment, but make sure you
don't telecast the argument we had earlier

63
00:06:54,321 --> 00:06:56,441
No sir! We won't
Please come in

64
00:06:56,572 --> 00:06:58,212
I wont speak one more word

65
00:06:58,323 --> 00:07:01,163
Sir, just come on to the stage,
we'll take care of the rest

66
00:07:01,784 --> 00:07:04,184
Let's finish it off and leave

67
00:07:09,533 --> 00:07:13,173
We have reached the end
of this semi-final round...

68
00:07:13,365 --> 00:07:16,125
...3 of the contestants here
would move on to the finals

69
00:07:16,282 --> 00:07:18,842
And the winner would be given a
chance to direct a feature film

70
00:07:19,035 --> 00:07:22,115
Our judges will now announce the results

71
00:07:22,281 --> 00:07:23,921
Let him announce

72
00:07:24,529 --> 00:07:28,249
Mukhil sir, who is gonna
be eliminated today?

73
00:07:30,996 --> 00:07:34,076
Given an option I would
eliminate all 4 of them

74
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:37,445
But as the situation demands
just one elimination...

75
00:07:39,663 --> 00:07:40,583
...Karthik

76
00:07:43,788 --> 00:07:44,948
...I reject you

77
00:08:04,453 --> 00:08:10,573
Winning is just not about being
acclaimed by critic or reaching the finals

78
00:08:10,873 --> 00:08:12,273
It's about making a profit

79
00:08:12,374 --> 00:08:15,854
That is why we, producers, only can
determine the winning formula

80
00:08:16,088 --> 00:08:20,488
I am telling right away,
I am gonna produce his film

81
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:25,940
Karthik, come by my office
tomorrow and collect your advance

82
00:08:26,379 --> 00:08:28,459
I will produce your film

83
00:08:34,499 --> 00:08:38,339
Idiotic semi-finals
Nonsense judgement

84
00:08:38,542 --> 00:08:41,502
From today you are
a feature film director

85
00:08:47,129 --> 00:08:50,529
It has been a big day

86
00:08:50,715 --> 00:08:57,795
Today on our stage we got
a producer for Karthik's debut film

87
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:14,075
They've killed somebody

88
00:09:14,177 --> 00:09:17,257
Look, what an atrocity!

89
00:09:17,469 --> 00:09:19,829
No one came to help
even in middle of the day

90
00:09:19,969 --> 00:09:23,969
I'm already very tensed
Just keep quiet

91
00:09:24,466 --> 00:09:26,706
Yesterday I just uttered a few
words out of frustration

92
00:09:26,844 --> 00:09:29,124
Believing that he has come
all the way to office

93
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:32,420
There has been reports of your act
in almost all newspapers

94
00:09:32,593 --> 00:09:35,673
The boy's uncle is a reporter,
hence there is a half page coverage

95
00:09:38,428 --> 00:09:39,748
What to do then?

96
00:09:41,218 --> 00:09:43,898
Karthik?
Sir is calling you

97
00:09:45,301 --> 00:09:48,421
Be confident and narrate your story

98
00:09:48,681 --> 00:09:49,761
All the best

99
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:56,262
A train traveling at high speed

100
00:09:56,393 --> 00:09:58,233
Let's have shots cut
at every station track

101
00:09:58,349 --> 00:10:02,309
Then we 'll super impose
the title melody sound track here

102
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:03,879
Train sound...

103
00:10:07,266 --> 00:10:10,146
Now he gets down
at the main train station

104
00:10:10,351 --> 00:10:12,391
Goes straight to her
house but its locked

105
00:10:12,514 --> 00:10:15,474
He breaks in with full force-

106
00:10:25,768 --> 00:10:28,528
He finds her hanging to death, Right?

107
00:10:28,727 --> 00:10:30,687
- Yes, sir
- I know

108
00:10:31,981 --> 00:10:34,701
Finally it boils down to
killing the Actor to bag an award

109
00:10:34,854 --> 00:10:36,454
Sir, it's not such an ordinary script

110
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,800
I have a strong message
in this movie that reflects...

111
00:10:38,936 --> 00:10:41,136
...and questions the societal
problems of the world

112
00:10:41,268 --> 00:10:44,068
After that, who will run
behind the law suits?

113
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:49,240
Look, you have substance

114
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:51,884
I don't want to make movies
on Social revolutions

115
00:10:52,063 --> 00:10:54,223
I want...uh...uh...

116
00:10:54,986 --> 00:10:56,506
I want to make a Gangster movie

117
00:10:56,609 --> 00:11:00,689
On hardcore violence and bloodshed

118
00:11:00,901 --> 00:11:05,461
A movie like Godfather, Scarface
and the likes

119
00:11:09,691 --> 00:11:11,131
See like this movies

120
00:11:11,523 --> 00:11:15,923
A similar script! Am even okay
if you rip off from these scripts

121
00:11:16,189 --> 00:11:19,909
Come up with a good Gangster script
I'll produce your movie

122
00:11:20,189 --> 00:11:21,949
I Guarantee

123
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:30,120
Correct...no more excuses!

124
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,680
I've decided to make
a Gangster movie

125
00:11:32,818 --> 00:11:35,498
- Superb pal...
- But not an imaginary story

126
00:11:35,657 --> 00:11:41,337
I am going to meet them...understand them
And then make a soulful story

127
00:11:41,824 --> 00:11:45,264
A Realistic movie
Based on a True story!

128
00:11:53,069 --> 00:11:55,509
Welding Kumar who got
life sentence got murdered

129
00:12:01,405 --> 00:12:02,885
Did you find anything?

130
00:12:04,951 --> 00:12:09,311
These are all that I could find

131
00:12:09,576 --> 00:12:14,176
These are the same old stories
Already made in to movies

132
00:12:14,403 --> 00:12:16,523
And they are all dead

133
00:12:16,658 --> 00:12:19,898
I want to know about
a gangster who is in on the rise...

134
00:12:20,155 --> 00:12:24,595
...need to meet him, personally,
watch him closely, and then write a script

135
00:12:24,831 --> 00:12:28,431
You expect them to write an autobiography
and place it in the library

136
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:30,580
Why are you wasting my time?

137
00:12:31,077 --> 00:12:34,037
You are an experienced reporter

138
00:12:34,247 --> 00:12:37,007
You should be knowing someone

139
00:12:37,206 --> 00:12:39,166
I just cover politics and Lankan issue

140
00:12:39,914 --> 00:12:41,594
Both are one and the same

141
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,320
During your days...

142
00:12:46,874 --> 00:12:49,794
...the 'Cat eyed Actress'
was Madhuri, right?

143
00:12:51,993 --> 00:12:54,753
All the gangsters life
has the same template

144
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:56,676
They will kill someone and take his place

145
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:59,193
In turn someone else
will kill him and takes his

146
00:12:59,329 --> 00:13:02,649
How long are you gonna
make the same sort of movies?

147
00:13:04,287 --> 00:13:09,927
There is a guy, like
never seen in any movie

148
00:13:10,496 --> 00:13:13,856
- An outlaw in Madurai
- Rowdy in Madurai?

149
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:16,119
Great! Who is that?

150
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:18,270
His name is...

151
00:13:20,376 --> 00:13:23,016
3 years ago, 4 murders were happen
in the fruit market at Madurai

152
00:13:23,168 --> 00:13:25,648
- I heard of him, sir!
- He is the first accused in that

153
00:13:25,796 --> 00:13:28,556
young, should be in his late thirties

154
00:13:28,837 --> 00:13:31,717
Unable to retrieve his name

155
00:13:32,544 --> 00:13:37,184
Don't worry
I will get you the case file

156
00:13:37,959 --> 00:13:40,479
Don't ever use his name

157
00:13:41,086 --> 00:13:42,926
He will find and kill you

158
00:13:43,547 --> 00:13:45,947
He is a psychopath

159
00:13:48,254 --> 00:13:50,734
His name is Sethu

160
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:53,519
'Assault' Sethu

161
00:14:49,136 --> 00:14:50,696
What's your name?

162
00:14:57,517 --> 00:14:59,237
'Hidden Tiger'

163
00:15:00,808 --> 00:15:03,768
Hey, there is an article about him

164
00:15:04,182 --> 00:15:05,742
Shocking revelation!

165
00:15:05,931 --> 00:15:07,691
That was written by uncle's friend

166
00:15:07,853 --> 00:15:10,813
Right! He is writing it in his
pen name as 'Hidden Tiger'

167
00:15:11,013 --> 00:15:13,773
Even he writes it spying on him

168
00:15:13,927 --> 00:15:17,407
I can get you his contact details,
but you gotta be careful

169
00:15:17,644 --> 00:15:19,084
You are the one, right?

170
00:15:21,434 --> 00:15:25,514
You could have published
my photo, right?

171
00:15:26,394 --> 00:15:27,834
Instead you drew a cartoon

172
00:15:28,224 --> 00:15:30,904
How many of them
would have laughed at it?

173
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:36,777
Do I look funny?

174
00:15:46,105 --> 00:15:47,905
Till now it was working

175
00:15:49,065 --> 00:15:51,105
Anyone else got a light?

176
00:15:51,229 --> 00:15:52,629
That's why snatched this

177
00:15:52,735 --> 00:15:54,855
Do you?

178
00:15:55,194 --> 00:15:57,554
Even if he has, it would
be wet by now

179
00:15:57,775 --> 00:15:59,695
Hey, get the tools

180
00:16:07,191 --> 00:16:08,711
Brother, I'll kill him

181
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:11,020
Why are you in such a hurry to kill?

182
00:16:11,147 --> 00:16:14,307
You have not been around that long,
first watch and learn

183
00:16:14,486 --> 00:16:16,526
- One step at a time
- Okay, brother

184
00:16:20,819 --> 00:16:24,019
Thank God!
All that petrol would be wasted

185
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:30,604
'Sleeping Truth' by 'Hidden Tiger'

186
00:16:31,566 --> 00:16:34,206
Truth hurts, do you know that?

187
00:16:36,031 --> 00:16:41,391
Especially the truth of peeping
into my house will hurt like hell

188
00:17:11,617 --> 00:17:14,337
Hey he may be a psycho

189
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:17,093
Not may be, he is actually a psycho

190
00:17:19,156 --> 00:17:22,636
I am going to Madurai and
making a movie on Sethu's life

191
00:17:25,328 --> 00:17:31,648
All the Madurai talk strikes a bell
on someone in our college

192
00:17:33,164 --> 00:17:34,524
'Oorni'

193
00:17:34,749 --> 00:17:37,309
Stop

194
00:17:38,951 --> 00:17:40,911
That lady is my customer

195
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,120
That white shirt man
is my customer

196
00:17:44,285 --> 00:17:49,365
That blue T-Shirt guy,
he's my customer

197
00:17:56,121 --> 00:17:58,721
Look! He is staring at me

198
00:18:03,706 --> 00:18:05,186
Move aside

199
00:18:05,326 --> 00:18:09,006
He is mine, move along

200
00:18:09,663 --> 00:18:11,583
I said I don't need an auto

201
00:18:11,707 --> 00:18:13,067
Give back my bag

202
00:18:13,163 --> 00:18:17,283
Just shut up and come with me
Brother is waiting for you

203
00:18:19,086 --> 00:18:21,286
Hello, I think you have mistaken me

204
00:18:21,419 --> 00:18:23,459
Shut up and come

205
00:18:23,584 --> 00:18:26,024
Just give me my bag
I'll leave

206
00:18:44,168 --> 00:18:46,328
He is my guy
You got scared?

207
00:18:46,463 --> 00:18:48,183
Were you gonna pee in your pants?

208
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:50,454
Ganesh you shouldn't have
threatened him a lot

209
00:18:50,588 --> 00:18:52,548
How long it's been since college

210
00:18:52,753 --> 00:18:54,713
Should make a grand appearance, right?

211
00:18:54,879 --> 00:18:56,679
Then why all of a sudden to Madurai?

212
00:19:03,504 --> 00:19:06,584
Hey why are you settling down?

213
00:19:07,301 --> 00:19:09,421
Dude, I am your guest

214
00:19:09,551 --> 00:19:11,511
What plan you have come?

215
00:19:11,677 --> 00:19:14,757
Take bath, let's visit
the temple and then my shop

216
00:19:14,927 --> 00:19:18,807
Let's have lunch at Amma mess and then
you can board the train back home tonight

217
00:19:19,677 --> 00:19:25,077
Oorni, just for a month! Will write
a story about Sethu and I'll leave

218
00:19:25,885 --> 00:19:29,285
They are all cold blooded murderers

219
00:19:29,468 --> 00:19:30,708
We can't go close to them

220
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:31,759
Let them be

221
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,400
You need to
take risk in life to succeed

222
00:19:34,552 --> 00:19:35,672
Risk?

223
00:19:35,926 --> 00:19:39,806
I am gonna have a kid in 5 months, that
itself makes my mark in the risk factor

224
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,800
Shame on you
So, that's your achievement in life?

225
00:19:45,675 --> 00:19:49,755
That is what most men
achieve in their life

226
00:19:49,968 --> 00:19:52,568
And that is enough for me

227
00:19:53,799 --> 00:19:56,159
Are you even listening?

228
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:57,910
Leave my bag

229
00:20:32,308 --> 00:20:34,348
I got this only for you!

230
00:20:36,933 --> 00:20:41,013
All right, forget the night train
Leave early tomorrow

231
00:20:48,313 --> 00:20:53,113
Don't you understand
It's for your sake

232
00:20:53,897 --> 00:20:57,977
Sethu and his gang are
extremely dangerous...

233
00:20:58,273 --> 00:21:00,193
...violent people

234
00:21:00,607 --> 00:21:02,647
There are plenty of subjects
untapped in movies

235
00:21:02,773 --> 00:21:05,493
I have a couple of stories
Hear me out

236
00:21:12,397 --> 00:21:14,637
Is it true?

237
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:17,142
Will I actually look good on-screen?

238
00:21:17,857 --> 00:21:22,537
I'm actually a stage performer
at school! Not sure of big screens

239
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:24,340
Will I look good?

240
00:21:32,941 --> 00:21:34,701
Second hero?

241
00:21:35,948 --> 00:21:39,508
- Don't mock me dude
- Am serious

242
00:21:39,987 --> 00:21:41,947
Am I a hero material?

243
00:21:43,402 --> 00:21:45,242
You will make me act, right?

244
00:21:52,734 --> 00:21:56,054
Is Sethu that big a deal?
Is he impossible to reach?

245
00:21:56,572 --> 00:21:58,412
Is he such a big-wig?

246
00:21:58,616 --> 00:21:59,896
Superb!

247
00:21:59,989 --> 00:22:04,389
We start our movie work first
thing tomorrow morning

248
00:22:04,619 --> 00:22:06,619
Start it...and kill it

249
00:22:08,117 --> 00:22:09,557
Get on board

250
00:22:19,907 --> 00:22:21,227
- Who is he?
- Friend bro!

251
00:22:21,363 --> 00:22:23,163
Even you're not telling anything bro

252
00:22:26,912 --> 00:22:28,072
Dude, he is Sethu

253
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:35,490
Don't look at him

254
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:52,053
In this city,
Sethu is a brand

255
00:22:56,121 --> 00:22:58,201
Happy birthday
To Sethurayan

256
00:23:17,502 --> 00:23:19,022
Brother, greetings

257
00:23:20,084 --> 00:23:22,884
An underworld don,
A political weapon, A Kingmaker

258
00:23:23,334 --> 00:23:25,414
An Establishment by himself

259
00:23:25,589 --> 00:23:27,789
You expect us to not to react?

260
00:23:28,208 --> 00:23:29,888
Sir we didn't start anything

261
00:23:30,001 --> 00:23:32,041
I have just closed down
what he started

262
00:23:32,167 --> 00:23:35,927
Sir we didn't start anything
They murdered my brother last month

263
00:23:36,124 --> 00:23:38,684
It's tit for tat, now its tallied

264
00:23:40,623 --> 00:23:43,503
- Chopped his hand?
- That too in a dreadful way

265
00:23:43,667 --> 00:23:44,707
- Friend bro
- Welcome

266
00:23:44,794 --> 00:23:47,674
- He should have been killed 5 years ago
- How did it happen?

267
00:23:49,881 --> 00:23:51,081
Rasu

268
00:23:54,506 --> 00:23:56,106
Surround him

269
00:23:57,752 --> 00:23:59,312
Kill him

270
00:24:26,221 --> 00:24:27,341
What happened?

271
00:24:29,924 --> 00:24:32,364
Sethu, are you alright?

272
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:35,030
Sethu's best ally is Rasu

273
00:24:37,967 --> 00:24:40,767
Sethu's school friend,
Now his Right-hand

274
00:24:40,923 --> 00:24:44,203
Been with him since Sethu started

275
00:24:44,385 --> 00:24:46,825
Sethu's prime weapon in field

276
00:24:47,014 --> 00:24:50,174
He will stare at everyone, will
hit anyone who stands up to him

277
00:24:50,386 --> 00:24:54,546
A hardcore alcoholic,
his only weakness

278
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:57,690
After Rasu, its Senthil

279
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:01,820
Half of Madurai is deaf
because of his slaps

280
00:25:02,101 --> 00:25:04,141
Dumb but yet a strong weapon

281
00:25:04,476 --> 00:25:05,636
A foodie

282
00:25:05,767 --> 00:25:08,527
Strange for a gangster
A teetotaler who doesn't stare at a girl

283
00:25:08,724 --> 00:25:10,484
A family attached gangster

284
00:25:10,594 --> 00:25:11,914
A great devotee

285
00:25:12,014 --> 00:25:13,534
His only weakness...

286
00:25:15,555 --> 00:25:16,755
Soft porn!

287
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:19,970
A movie a day keeps him awake

288
00:25:20,142 --> 00:25:21,782
A hardcore film buff

289
00:25:22,058 --> 00:25:25,338
After them the next
alarming person is Palani

290
00:25:25,557 --> 00:25:27,117
Petty-shop Palani

291
00:25:33,308 --> 00:25:35,628
The public is scared to
go even near his shop

292
00:25:35,809 --> 00:25:43,649
Bores the entire crowd to death
with his most annoying stories

293
00:25:46,272 --> 00:25:48,632
Mastered the art of killing
through story-telling

294
00:25:54,565 --> 00:25:58,805
Been in this area since Sethu's birth

295
00:25:59,023 --> 00:26:01,343
A one-stop-shop for Sethu's history

296
00:26:01,521 --> 00:26:07,041
Some confidence and a whole lot
of patience can crack this weapon

297
00:26:30,443 --> 00:26:32,323
Sethu is very dangerous

298
00:26:35,821 --> 00:26:37,941
I can't get close to him directly

299
00:26:40,651 --> 00:26:43,811
He is like a lion
Nearing him will kill us

300
00:26:46,448 --> 00:26:49,408
We have got 3 monkeys to near him

301
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:50,940
Rasu

302
00:26:51,194 --> 00:26:53,034
- What do you want to eat?
- Get me some eggs

303
00:26:53,152 --> 00:26:54,192
Senthil

304
00:26:54,278 --> 00:26:56,718
Boys, do check
if they'll play all the scenes

305
00:26:56,903 --> 00:26:58,263
Don't waste money

306
00:26:58,363 --> 00:26:59,563
Palani

307
00:27:03,281 --> 00:27:06,041
He shouldn't know we are
here to make a film on him

308
00:27:06,198 --> 00:27:07,398
If he gets to know...

309
00:27:07,489 --> 00:27:09,089
We are dead

310
00:27:09,449 --> 00:27:11,649
You took all these days to find that?

311
00:27:11,782 --> 00:27:14,502
I told you that on Day-1

312
00:27:14,657 --> 00:27:17,977
It's takes a lot of work and
effort to write Sethu's script

313
00:27:18,154 --> 00:27:22,274
My only support in this
dangerous mission is...

314
00:27:23,072 --> 00:27:27,592
The future superstar of Tamil movies,
our movie's second hero 'Oorni'

315
00:27:28,702 --> 00:27:31,182
Use this trump card always
Let's see how you keep up

316
00:27:31,326 --> 00:27:33,526
- They are calling you, bro
- Wait, I'll be back

317
00:27:35,289 --> 00:27:38,369
There are 3 weapons that
I can use for my mission

318
00:27:38,746 --> 00:27:41,906
Rasu...Senthil...Palani

319
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:44,959
So how did Sethu became the Sethu?
That's the question

320
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,720
Sethu...I'm waiting!

321
00:28:16,292 --> 00:28:18,252
See in that top rack

322
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:40,950
I'll take this

323
00:28:41,254 --> 00:28:43,814
Hello, come on...why
do you snatch all sarees that I choose?

324
00:28:43,965 --> 00:28:46,165
Mind your words
I'll cut your tongue

325
00:28:46,297 --> 00:28:47,937
I've come to take sarees of my choice

326
00:28:48,086 --> 00:28:50,486
Not to snatch the ones
chosen by some fool

327
00:28:50,628 --> 00:28:51,828
Dullard

328
00:28:51,962 --> 00:28:54,042
Mind your tongue
I'll show you who I am

329
00:28:54,211 --> 00:28:56,451
How dare you call me like that

330
00:28:56,627 --> 00:28:57,587
Please be quiet

331
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:00,392
Why do you quarrel unnecessarily?

332
00:29:00,542 --> 00:29:02,702
- Please don't quarrel
- Mind your business

333
00:29:02,833 --> 00:29:05,913
- Excuse me, your bag is open
- Thanks

334
00:29:07,839 --> 00:29:09,759
I remember seeing you somewhere

335
00:29:10,589 --> 00:29:14,989
Me...I am a film director
You should've seen me in TV shows

336
00:29:15,218 --> 00:29:17,298
Oh...Ok

337
00:29:19,217 --> 00:29:21,537
We came first...you've to
give that saree to us

338
00:29:21,675 --> 00:29:23,675
I saw it first

339
00:29:25,511 --> 00:29:27,111
There are 2 sarees missing

340
00:29:27,347 --> 00:29:29,787
Are you ladies creating a scene
and ransacking our store?

341
00:29:29,927 --> 00:29:32,127
What, do we look like
petty thieves to you?

342
00:29:32,259 --> 00:29:34,699
Didn't I tell you then
let us go for another shop?

343
00:29:34,844 --> 00:29:35,844
But you didn't listen

344
00:29:35,927 --> 00:29:37,007
Let's go

345
00:29:37,094 --> 00:29:40,214
For a month's interest,
he'll scold for 3 months

346
00:29:41,634 --> 00:29:44,794
Dude, someone has stolen 2 sarees

347
00:29:45,009 --> 00:29:48,249
Very well, this is what happens
to those who cheat me

348
00:29:48,759 --> 00:29:50,279
This happens frequently?

349
00:29:50,384 --> 00:29:54,064
They steal from here and sell it
at installments at a lower rate

350
00:29:54,266 --> 00:29:57,186
All those ladies are partners-in-crime

351
00:29:57,351 --> 00:30:01,311
Perfect planning and execution
That's their profession

352
00:30:01,558 --> 00:30:03,958
We should show this as
a scene in our movie

353
00:30:04,141 --> 00:30:07,341
Hello Ramesh bro,
Seems to be very busy nowadays

354
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:09,914
Came for shopping with my friend

355
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,080
Do you want it?

356
00:30:31,226 --> 00:30:34,706
We'll not go to the court

357
00:30:34,935 --> 00:30:40,175
But we want all our
proposition to be sealed

358
00:30:40,474 --> 00:30:42,514
Else, I'll have to take a tougher route

359
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,360
Don't make a fuss about it

360
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,320
Brother, I think it's a good proposition

361
00:30:46,439 --> 00:30:48,319
Probably we can get away
with the rice mill

362
00:30:48,438 --> 00:30:49,438
Keep quiet

363
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:53,760
Let's get this done right away
Let's not blew it up

364
00:30:54,065 --> 00:30:55,785
- Okay
- Let's finish it

365
00:30:56,232 --> 00:30:58,472
Take everything except the rice mill

366
00:30:58,607 --> 00:31:01,087
And ask your party to pay
Rs 4 million instead

367
00:31:01,229 --> 00:31:04,829
My party will give only 3 Million...not 4

368
00:31:05,022 --> 00:31:06,022
Let's finish it

369
00:31:06,398 --> 00:31:08,758
We'll finish the registration
process on Wednesday

370
00:31:09,395 --> 00:31:13,275
Sethu, some of your men are
crossing their limits

371
00:31:13,477 --> 00:31:15,597
Warn them not to invite trouble

372
00:31:15,776 --> 00:31:17,976
How dare you warn us?

373
00:31:18,151 --> 00:31:19,911
Brother have some beer please

374
00:31:20,023 --> 00:31:20,783
Don't, bro

375
00:31:20,898 --> 00:31:24,698
- You won't drink, brother
- He doesn't drink beer

376
00:31:24,939 --> 00:31:27,859
- Shut up
- Don't get angry

377
00:31:33,021 --> 00:31:35,221
Here's your cut

378
00:31:35,696 --> 00:31:38,416
Between us, you don't have to be formal

379
00:31:39,196 --> 00:31:41,796
Take it
Business is Business

380
00:31:42,778 --> 00:31:45,898
These fools argument get us money

381
00:31:52,441 --> 00:31:54,521
So your father is not
active in business now?

382
00:31:54,734 --> 00:31:56,734
Are you taking care
of the business now?

383
00:31:57,155 --> 00:31:59,795
Dad is not keeping well

384
00:31:59,988 --> 00:32:03,308
The stab on his intestines has
got him down completely

385
00:32:04,199 --> 00:32:07,519
I've quit my job! And taking
care of the business completely

386
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:13,460
Take care of him
He was a legend at his time

387
00:32:17,612 --> 00:32:19,732
Dad asked me
to inform you something

388
00:32:19,866 --> 00:32:21,786
Mariappan had come to meet dad

389
00:32:21,906 --> 00:32:23,826
Bhupathi's right-hand

390
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,880
Sekar and Ganesh gang have reconciled

391
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:30,479
They cannot do business
when you are alive

392
00:32:30,912 --> 00:32:33,392
Am not sure if that’s the truth

393
00:32:33,619 --> 00:32:39,939
But I could sense someone outside
or within us spying you

394
00:32:40,284 --> 00:32:42,044
Be careful!

395
00:33:02,281 --> 00:33:06,641
Why do they keep talking?
Won't they get into action?

396
00:33:10,872 --> 00:33:12,392
What he said is correct

397
00:33:12,539 --> 00:33:14,139
Hey go and speak

398
00:33:14,251 --> 00:33:17,171
Yes, I've mediated for that
What is your problem now?

399
00:33:17,624 --> 00:33:19,664
Don't buy the trouble yourself

400
00:33:19,793 --> 00:33:22,193
What rubbish are you talking, dullard!

401
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:24,017
Get lost

402
00:33:24,668 --> 00:33:26,748
Kuruvamma!

403
00:33:26,916 --> 00:33:27,916
She is a beauty

404
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,400
- During childhood Sethu...
- First listen to this

405
00:33:30,538 --> 00:33:32,778
I went to her house to
convey my wish to marry her

406
00:33:32,957 --> 00:33:36,317
Their parents didn't bother
to respect me, I was ashamed

407
00:33:36,501 --> 00:33:38,141
But I said I won't leave home

408
00:33:38,290 --> 00:33:42,810
Until Kuruvamma comes and
says she doesn't like me

409
00:33:43,127 --> 00:33:45,887
I am telling you such
an important information

410
00:33:46,089 --> 00:33:50,009
Today we don't have porn bits
Just leave the place now

411
00:33:51,917 --> 00:33:56,437
What crap is this?
Nothing beats that german movie

412
00:33:56,711 --> 00:33:59,071
That's classic
Worth an infinite watch

413
00:33:59,213 --> 00:34:01,413
Especially the kitchen scene

414
00:34:07,675 --> 00:34:09,115
Do you have that CD?

415
00:34:09,253 --> 00:34:12,133
That's the best I've ever seen!
But they speak in English

416
00:34:12,303 --> 00:34:14,383
But do you have
a translated copy of this?

417
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:18,819
- I'll try
- Let's not exchange in open

418
00:34:18,967 --> 00:34:23,287
Keep your CD in my bike
I'll watch and keep it back in yours bike

419
00:34:27,135 --> 00:34:29,375
That's the worst deal in history

420
00:34:29,675 --> 00:34:32,355
It was during the sunset
Siva strolls along the street

421
00:34:32,549 --> 00:34:36,109
A beautiful girl walks towards him

422
00:34:36,385 --> 00:34:40,585
The moment she comes closer,
I realised she is Kuruvamma

423
00:34:40,841 --> 00:34:43,401
That day I scolded her a lot

424
00:34:43,546 --> 00:34:47,026
She poured kerosene on her and
was about to burn herself alive

425
00:34:47,259 --> 00:34:49,099
She did that because you scolded her?

426
00:34:49,256 --> 00:34:51,216
- Yes, you're right
- Nonsense

427
00:34:51,343 --> 00:34:56,143
So, they say Sethu was imprisoned
for 3 years...Do you know?

428
00:34:56,431 --> 00:35:02,031
That's the day she had
cooked my brinjal fry

429
00:35:02,388 --> 00:35:03,908
Brinjal fry!

430
00:35:04,347 --> 00:35:06,507
So...is this movie
a sequel of yesterday's?

431
00:35:06,642 --> 00:35:08,562
No dude, it's completely
a different story

432
00:35:08,681 --> 00:35:11,001
Hey, just turn the bike
That's my uncle

433
00:35:11,142 --> 00:35:12,822
If he looks at me,
I am done

434
00:35:12,931 --> 00:35:16,971
Isn't this where the Aadukalam
movie is screening?

435
00:35:22,683 --> 00:35:26,443
Guys that Japanese movie is excellent

436
00:35:26,811 --> 00:35:29,851
Kept in your bike
You do keep if you've got anything new

437
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:38,240
So your interest is World cinema?

438
00:36:18,356 --> 00:36:24,236
I could see
an old lady sitting there

439
00:36:27,898 --> 00:36:31,978
No one is there, but what
you see is Kuruvamma

440
00:36:39,404 --> 00:36:41,964
Could you see Sivanesan on this side?

441
00:36:44,278 --> 00:36:48,198
You can't see
That's why it's called Hallucination

442
00:36:48,651 --> 00:36:51,091
If we still keep hearing
stories from that old man...

443
00:36:51,235 --> 00:36:55,035
...these characters would
be part of our life

444
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,440
Enough!

445
00:37:04,322 --> 00:37:06,202
Let's find a solution to all of this

446
00:37:10,074 --> 00:37:14,594
Will you just stop
your Kuruvamma story?

447
00:37:15,363 --> 00:37:17,963
I've been asking about
Sethu all these days

448
00:37:18,112 --> 00:37:20,072
- Why do you ask about Sethu?
- Why?

449
00:37:20,197 --> 00:37:23,077
Did we ever ask why you
tell Kuruvamma stories?

450
00:37:23,234 --> 00:37:24,634
Why do you ask us then?

451
00:37:24,744 --> 00:37:26,664
I can't tell anything about Sethu

452
00:37:29,742 --> 00:37:32,302
Take this 100 bucks
Close our account

453
00:37:32,494 --> 00:37:34,174
We are never coming back here

454
00:37:34,288 --> 00:37:37,048
Whoever comes here
will enquire about Sethu

455
00:37:37,244 --> 00:37:39,884
Even last week, there was someone

456
00:37:40,078 --> 00:37:42,678
He tweaked lot of questions about Sethu

457
00:37:42,994 --> 00:37:44,514
Didn't know why?

458
00:37:44,951 --> 00:37:45,991
Then?

459
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:49,920
Someone said a reporter
wanted to write about Sethu

460
00:37:50,114 --> 00:37:51,114
Then...

461
00:37:51,203 --> 00:37:57,883
He went alone to the fields
tied his hands and burnt himself alive

462
00:37:58,287 --> 00:37:59,167
What?

463
00:37:59,243 --> 00:38:02,003
I said he was burnt
alive by Sethu's gang

464
00:38:02,162 --> 00:38:04,602
Ruthless killers

465
00:38:04,743 --> 00:38:06,663
How did they know
about the reporter?

466
00:38:06,787 --> 00:38:09,947
I told them
They gave me 350 bucks

467
00:38:10,161 --> 00:38:13,081
Did you guys ask about Sethu?

468
00:38:13,492 --> 00:38:18,092
No...why do we talk about him?
Ruthless killers

469
00:38:18,833 --> 00:38:21,193
Dude, get me a drink

470
00:38:21,333 --> 00:38:23,293
Please, give him one

471
00:38:26,124 --> 00:38:27,804
You are such a waste

472
00:38:28,876 --> 00:38:33,036
We drink here everyday
Is that of any use?

473
00:38:33,248 --> 00:38:35,448
That needs some smartness

474
00:38:42,793 --> 00:38:44,193
Tandoori chicken

475
00:38:45,585 --> 00:38:48,385
Goes good with your drink

476
00:38:48,544 --> 00:38:51,504
We sit in the next table everyday

477
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:54,510
We are neighbours-in-drinks

478
00:38:59,253 --> 00:39:02,213
Matter over

479
00:39:03,334 --> 00:39:06,894
If he eats that chicken,
we have befriended him

480
00:39:07,089 --> 00:39:08,369
Is he eating that?

481
00:39:11,009 --> 00:39:13,089
Yes, he is...

482
00:39:14,135 --> 00:39:16,375
That's it

483
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:22,160
While leaving, he'll thank us

484
00:39:26,594 --> 00:39:27,914
He's coming

485
00:39:35,716 --> 00:39:39,356
Don't mention it
No thanks between us

486
00:39:42,674 --> 00:39:46,194
Do you think
I can't afford a chicken?

487
00:39:47,594 --> 00:39:49,354
What are you showing off for?

488
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:52,710
- What's my account balance here?
- 5000 bucks or more

489
00:39:52,883 --> 00:39:55,683
He'll settle it
He has to

490
00:39:55,849 --> 00:39:58,169
Pith chicken for me?!?!

491
00:40:08,138 --> 00:40:09,738
Smart move!

492
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:16,568
Senthil is our last hope

493
00:40:16,682 --> 00:40:19,722
Feels like we live to
supply porn films to him

494
00:40:20,182 --> 00:40:21,742
Just observe

495
00:40:22,601 --> 00:40:24,681
How are you brother?

496
00:40:24,810 --> 00:40:28,370
You guys are worse than me
Just get married soon

497
00:40:28,558 --> 00:40:29,638
Definitely bro!

498
00:40:29,809 --> 00:40:31,889
So how was the Korean movie?

499
00:40:32,054 --> 00:40:35,174
Korean movie? The last one
was an African movie, right?

500
00:40:35,347 --> 00:40:37,227
The other day
I kept it in your bike

501
00:40:37,348 --> 00:40:40,028
Written 'Vettayadu Vilayadu'
movie name in its cover

502
00:40:40,264 --> 00:40:42,064
That day when I waved to you

503
00:40:42,183 --> 00:40:43,583
I thought you are telling 'bye'

504
00:40:43,689 --> 00:40:45,369
Why didn't you tell me
about it that day?

505
00:40:45,478 --> 00:40:46,118
That's ok

506
00:40:46,187 --> 00:40:48,747
It's in your back, tell me
how it is after watching the movie

507
00:40:48,897 --> 00:40:50,297
Want some Samosa?

508
00:41:01,355 --> 00:41:03,195
Even the last hope flopped

509
00:41:08,606 --> 00:41:10,726
- What film is that?
- Some action movie

510
00:41:10,853 --> 00:41:12,733
Her dad forgot and
left it on the bike

511
00:41:13,145 --> 00:41:17,425
(Tamil hero Kamal Hassan's movie song)

512
00:41:53,445 --> 00:41:55,965
Stop it
Don't tease him

513
00:41:56,404 --> 00:41:58,604
Served hot, have it brother

514
00:41:58,783 --> 00:42:02,423
For all the trauma he went through
at least stop teasing him

515
00:42:06,363 --> 00:42:09,363
So, what happens
in the climax of the movie?

516
00:42:16,655 --> 00:42:19,415
What have you cooked?
Add more spice in it

517
00:42:19,573 --> 00:42:20,893
Okay, bro

518
00:42:31,535 --> 00:42:36,695
- So, couldn't see you last week?
- Yeah, had been to a family function

519
00:43:22,709 --> 00:43:24,229
Greetings, bro

520
00:43:24,416 --> 00:43:25,816
Brother...

521
00:43:28,667 --> 00:43:29,587
Have this

522
00:43:29,668 --> 00:43:32,068
Use the first toilet
I just cleaned it

523
00:43:32,373 --> 00:43:36,053
Use the first one,
I just cleaned it

524
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:39,530
You should be paying me
for using this toilet

525
00:44:13,174 --> 00:44:17,054
Brother, Sethu chapter is closed

526
00:44:17,298 --> 00:44:18,778
Wanna hear the bullet shots?

527
00:44:31,801 --> 00:44:35,401
Sethu looks very different

528
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:39,440
He has put down a lot of
weight, since I last saw him

529
00:44:41,215 --> 00:44:44,935
Come, drag whats left of Sethu

530
00:45:21,307 --> 00:45:24,187
So, all doors are shut
What do we do now?

531
00:45:24,347 --> 00:45:26,627
There's a guy called
Pandi in Sethu's gang

532
00:45:26,772 --> 00:45:31,052
He visits the brothel everyday
Shall we follow him too?

533
00:45:31,844 --> 00:45:34,004
Go back home

534
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:37,700
Roaming with you
lost almost a months business

535
00:45:38,558 --> 00:45:41,758
Can't you guys
even clean the shop

536
00:45:42,181 --> 00:45:44,341
You guys celebrate my absence

537
00:45:44,687 --> 00:45:46,407
Utter loudly
and bring the customers

538
00:45:46,563 --> 00:45:50,123
Hello...what's happening?

539
00:45:51,021 --> 00:45:56,421
The girl in the Orange clothes
is eyeing me for quite some days

540
00:45:56,731 --> 00:46:00,251
- Our area saree bandit
- That's okay

541
00:46:01,563 --> 00:46:04,403
I have a brilliant idea

542
00:46:04,562 --> 00:46:08,242
The girl eyeing you,
date her

543
00:46:08,561 --> 00:46:10,921
Who...that saree thief?

544
00:46:11,229 --> 00:46:13,189
Just pretend to love her

545
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:14,152
Why?

546
00:46:14,231 --> 00:46:16,711
Her mom cooks food for Sethu's gang

547
00:46:16,979 --> 00:46:19,619
And her mom want her
to be married to Sethu

548
00:46:22,478 --> 00:46:24,278
You mean she is Sethu's would-be

549
00:46:24,478 --> 00:46:25,638
May be!

550
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:27,880
That's the stupidest idea ever

551
00:46:27,981 --> 00:46:29,741
Sethu doesn't even turn towards her

552
00:46:29,897 --> 00:46:32,657
But she could be the trump card
we want to know about Sethu

553
00:46:32,855 --> 00:46:35,575
Mom and Daughter will tell
you stories about Sethu

554
00:46:35,741 --> 00:46:38,541
This is the risk that
you always boast about

555
00:46:38,986 --> 00:46:40,906
Taking risk is not an issue

556
00:46:41,404 --> 00:46:43,244
She looks okay

557
00:46:44,029 --> 00:46:48,429
Love and work doesn't go along well
That's my concern

558
00:46:49,068 --> 00:46:50,548
Too much!

559
00:46:51,234 --> 00:46:52,954
Do you want some bangles?

560
00:46:53,067 --> 00:46:55,347
That sister gave you this

561
00:46:56,028 --> 00:46:57,188
What's that?

562
00:47:01,529 --> 00:47:04,449
It's a letter from that girl...

563
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:10,523
Things are falling
into place, enjoy

564
00:47:25,326 --> 00:47:29,486
Speaking the love lingo

565
00:47:29,740 --> 00:47:34,020
Communicating through eyes

566
00:47:38,619 --> 00:47:43,019
Speaking the love lingo

567
00:47:43,245 --> 00:47:47,445
Communicating through eyes

568
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:58,120
Coward! He's not attending the call

569
00:47:58,243 --> 00:48:01,203
It's surely Ganesh! Sekar
would've picked up the call

570
00:48:01,369 --> 00:48:04,729
Is this a telugu song?

571
00:48:04,910 --> 00:48:06,030
For sure it's Sekar

572
00:48:06,119 --> 00:48:08,199
Who sent you?
Tell me

573
00:48:09,203 --> 00:48:11,363
I won't disclose

574
00:48:11,495 --> 00:48:14,695
Look at this terrorist attitude

575
00:48:16,041 --> 00:48:19,561
It's either Sekar or Ganesh...

576
00:48:19,999 --> 00:48:21,919
...want to kill me

577
00:48:22,082 --> 00:48:24,882
You eat only once, eat another idly

578
00:48:27,414 --> 00:48:29,494
I don't have time to investigate

579
00:48:29,830 --> 00:48:31,110
Have this Idly

580
00:48:31,205 --> 00:48:33,925
Don't you see me talking

581
00:48:34,081 --> 00:48:36,121
All you do is
feed me with the left overs

582
00:48:36,252 --> 00:48:37,212
Just leave

583
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:40,920
I make fresh food everyday
and you complain

584
00:48:41,335 --> 00:48:44,135
- Have you all eaten?
- We all had

585
00:48:44,294 --> 00:48:46,014
Serve him some idly
He will eat

586
00:48:46,127 --> 00:48:47,767
Please leave now

587
00:48:48,001 --> 00:48:50,721
Why waste the food on a dead man?

588
00:48:55,083 --> 00:48:56,163
Where were we?

589
00:48:57,041 --> 00:49:00,921
So...someone wants me dead
And you won't disclose them

590
00:49:01,125 --> 00:49:04,365
So...the only option is
to kill all my enemies

591
00:49:04,546 --> 00:49:06,666
You'll realise only when you die

592
00:49:06,798 --> 00:49:07,678
So you die

593
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:10,660
Just kill him...and get rid of the body

594
00:49:10,799 --> 00:49:13,279
Sethu, I'll tell the truth
What's in it for me?

595
00:49:13,427 --> 00:49:18,147
Just close his mouth...immediately

596
00:49:18,466 --> 00:49:20,506
Push it inside

597
00:49:22,424 --> 00:49:25,304
I am asking you since morning,
You didn't utter a word

598
00:49:25,467 --> 00:49:28,507
Now you offer a pity clue and
You expect me to listen

599
00:49:29,088 --> 00:49:30,608
And he needs some gift

600
00:49:30,755 --> 00:49:32,955
You just die
I know how to find him

601
00:49:33,087 --> 00:49:35,447
Just kill him...and give him
a horrifying death

602
00:49:35,594 --> 00:49:36,954
I'll do it

603
00:49:38,925 --> 00:49:43,525
What the hell is this shirt
look at the color

604
00:49:43,756 --> 00:49:45,076
And you want to kill someone

605
00:49:45,174 --> 00:49:48,614
For 2 years I've not done anything big
Trust me and give this to me! I'll do it

606
00:49:48,841 --> 00:49:53,761
You have just joined
You'll have to mature to do it

607
00:49:54,013 --> 00:49:56,013
First, change your shirt
You look like a comedian

608
00:49:56,139 --> 00:49:58,259
Just because you waited
long, doesn't mean I've to

609
00:49:58,386 --> 00:49:59,786
I'll do it please

610
00:49:59,886 --> 00:50:02,246
Kasi bro, just leave him
I'll do it

611
00:50:02,386 --> 00:50:05,666
Rasu bro, do tell him
to give me a chance

612
00:50:05,844 --> 00:50:07,444
Leave him, Rasu bro

613
00:50:16,139 --> 00:50:19,739
Early in the morning, in the middle of
the house, that too during breakfast

614
00:50:19,931 --> 00:50:22,211
Does it look like
a child's play to you both?

615
00:50:22,723 --> 00:50:24,043
Just clean this up

616
00:50:26,639 --> 00:50:27,879
Are you happy now?

617
00:50:27,973 --> 00:50:28,893
Clean that blood

618
00:50:29,016 --> 00:50:31,216
Both of us didn't execute at the end

619
00:50:31,347 --> 00:50:33,947
Police...Police is coming

620
00:50:34,141 --> 00:50:36,661
Let's take it back inside!

621
00:50:38,349 --> 00:50:40,029
Sub-Inspector is here

622
00:50:40,848 --> 00:50:42,168
What do we do now?

623
00:50:45,352 --> 00:50:47,512
- Sir, how about our case?
- I'll take care

624
00:50:48,809 --> 00:50:51,329
- Get a chair for sir
- Poured something down?

625
00:50:52,729 --> 00:50:55,769
Sethu, did you find the guy
who tried to kill you

626
00:50:56,397 --> 00:50:58,997
That's not a plot to kill me
It's some other problem

627
00:50:59,144 --> 00:51:02,344
I was incidentally there!
That's all

628
00:51:02,522 --> 00:51:04,682
So you didn't catch him?

629
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:07,020
I told you
he didn't come to kill me

630
00:51:07,145 --> 00:51:09,425
You're the Police
Find the killer

631
00:51:11,103 --> 00:51:12,103
Coffee?

632
00:51:12,188 --> 00:51:15,228
No thanks, got to leave
as I am in duty

633
00:51:15,439 --> 00:51:18,719
Take this money
and help me double it

634
00:51:18,899 --> 00:51:21,779
I plan to enroll my son in
an Engineering college next year

635
00:51:21,934 --> 00:51:26,294
No one lends money nowadays
Bank lends it if you just sign documents

636
00:51:26,566 --> 00:51:28,006
Try your best

637
00:51:28,105 --> 00:51:30,505
One more information

638
00:51:30,647 --> 00:51:35,647
20 days back we were asked to send your
file to the Commissioner's office

639
00:51:35,903 --> 00:51:38,783
I am not sure
if it's an encounter plan

640
00:51:38,942 --> 00:51:40,942
So, be careful

641
00:51:41,860 --> 00:51:46,460
If it's an encounter,
someone will be spying you

642
00:51:47,484 --> 00:51:51,324
I'll inform you if I get
any information from my officials

643
00:51:51,527 --> 00:51:54,327
You be careful
I'll leave now

644
00:52:02,901 --> 00:52:07,741
- Why did you drop the body, Idiot?
- Am I an idiot? You're the one...

645
00:52:08,446 --> 00:52:11,046
Fighting over a dead body
in the middle of the house

646
00:52:17,780 --> 00:52:19,380
What's the prayer for?

647
00:52:20,405 --> 00:52:22,965
Prayers won't be effective if shared

648
00:52:24,450 --> 00:52:28,530
But if it happens, we'll come here
again and light 2000 lamps

649
00:52:28,741 --> 00:52:29,821
What?

650
00:52:30,074 --> 00:52:31,674
We light 2000 lamps

651
00:52:46,035 --> 00:52:49,635
Off late you are more
into romance I guess

652
00:52:50,658 --> 00:52:53,178
Just now our plan is getting executed

653
00:52:53,574 --> 00:52:56,374
I am slowly fetching details
about Sethu from her

654
00:52:56,535 --> 00:52:58,575
Be careful
Don't play with her too much

655
00:52:58,700 --> 00:53:01,940
Else, I'll have to find you
a business here for a living

656
00:53:02,451 --> 00:53:04,611
I am just pretending
to be in love with her

657
00:53:04,744 --> 00:53:07,264
Will tell her the truth,
once our work is done

658
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:11,500
What are you doing?

659
00:53:11,620 --> 00:53:13,140
Am gonna go through Sethu's street

660
00:53:13,293 --> 00:53:16,053
Just turn the bike
Don't invite problems

661
00:53:16,749 --> 00:53:19,949
What's an issue to go through his streets?
He doesn't own the road

662
00:53:22,377 --> 00:53:24,817
Dude, I could see a problem

663
00:53:25,208 --> 00:53:26,168
Which house?

664
00:53:26,248 --> 00:53:28,088
Not sure! I am not
familiar with this area

665
00:53:28,249 --> 00:53:31,489
At sight we can definitely find it

666
00:53:32,913 --> 00:53:35,953
That's the one
Red benz car is outside

667
00:53:36,249 --> 00:53:40,929
Just take a picture as we pass by

668
00:53:41,169 --> 00:53:42,329
Take my phone

669
00:53:43,504 --> 00:53:46,184
Last week itself I've paid the bills

670
00:53:46,541 --> 00:53:48,341
How could they say we haven't?

671
00:53:48,461 --> 00:53:49,781
He looked at us...
Go fast

672
00:53:49,874 --> 00:53:51,834
- Did you take the photograph?
- Stupid go

673
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:53,880
Tomorrow I'll look into this payment

674
00:53:57,252 --> 00:53:59,252
It's a dead end

675
00:54:00,626 --> 00:54:01,466
You didn't tell me

676
00:54:01,539 --> 00:54:03,739
I told you I am not familiar
with these streets

677
00:54:03,883 --> 00:54:06,003
For sure, we are dead today

678
00:54:06,756 --> 00:54:08,316
Just be cool

679
00:54:08,423 --> 00:54:12,943
We'll casually return! I'll take care
Don't worry

680
00:54:15,259 --> 00:54:16,699
I'll call you back

681
00:54:22,298 --> 00:54:24,058
- Hey, what's up?
- Who are you both?

682
00:54:24,175 --> 00:54:26,695
- My name is Karthik
- Why are you roaming here?

683
00:54:27,467 --> 00:54:29,427
- We came to visit our friend
- Which house?

684
00:54:29,547 --> 00:54:31,347
- Ramakrishnan
- Chandrabose

685
00:54:31,466 --> 00:54:34,746
- Ramakrishna Chandrabose
- Tell the address clearly

686
00:54:34,922 --> 00:54:36,522
- Near the temple
- Near tea shop

687
00:54:37,715 --> 00:54:40,115
You have a bangle shop, right?

688
00:54:40,339 --> 00:54:41,859
Don't roam around here

689
00:54:42,047 --> 00:54:43,527
Get lost

690
00:54:46,216 --> 00:54:50,896
- What's the problem?
- Kids...lost their ways

691
00:54:51,133 --> 00:54:54,453
I had an issue
with them at the bar

692
00:54:55,306 --> 00:54:58,266
I was embarrassed
at my house cause of them

693
00:54:58,432 --> 00:55:00,232
Are they spying on us?

694
00:55:00,349 --> 00:55:03,229
Doesn't seem like that
They were scared

695
00:55:03,390 --> 00:55:05,550
One of the guys
owns a bangle shop

696
00:55:05,679 --> 00:55:09,199
Even the inspector warned us
We can't trust anyone

697
00:55:09,386 --> 00:55:11,506
Let's keep an eye on them

698
00:55:11,637 --> 00:55:12,997
I'll take care

699
00:55:13,098 --> 00:55:17,178
It's a small task anyways

700
00:55:17,592 --> 00:55:19,512
Watch them closely

701
00:55:19,639 --> 00:55:21,959
If you suspect anything,
inform us! We'll close it

702
00:55:22,098 --> 00:55:23,418
Okay, bro

703
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:36,960
Oorni, why did you switch on the TV?

704
00:56:00,936 --> 00:56:03,376
Your parents have gone to Mumbai

705
00:56:03,562 --> 00:56:05,762
Your wife has gone for her pregnancy

706
00:56:05,897 --> 00:56:08,777
So, you and sir have a party everyday

707
00:56:11,272 --> 00:56:16,152
He has come all the way to catch porn
movies in the day and drink all night?

708
00:56:16,399 --> 00:56:19,559
I am a Visual Communication student
I've come to take photos of Madurai

709
00:56:19,728 --> 00:56:20,888
Oh photos!

710
00:56:21,644 --> 00:56:23,004
Can we see those photos?

711
00:56:23,144 --> 00:56:26,984
We are just going to start it today

712
00:56:28,981 --> 00:56:30,221
So, shall we start then?

713
00:56:39,069 --> 00:56:42,189
Everything is over, I am going
to die without seeing my kid

714
00:56:42,363 --> 00:56:45,563
They will watch us now and
kill us in the evening

715
00:56:45,733 --> 00:56:47,933
I warned you a million times

716
00:56:48,067 --> 00:56:49,507
My family will miss me

717
00:56:51,693 --> 00:56:53,133
Did you shoot my picture?

718
00:56:54,986 --> 00:56:56,786
What's your plot?
Take the film reel out

719
00:56:56,900 --> 00:56:59,580
You had a photogenic posture, that's why

720
00:56:59,777 --> 00:57:01,657
Don't be sarcastic
Take the film reel out

721
00:57:01,778 --> 00:57:03,698
I swear you were looking good

722
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:06,420
I am going to break your camera

723
00:57:06,818 --> 00:57:07,858
Take the reel out first

724
00:57:07,947 --> 00:57:09,867
No film reel!
It's digital

725
00:57:10,071 --> 00:57:11,751
Just look at the pictures once

726
00:57:11,859 --> 00:57:13,179
How can you show immediatel?

727
00:57:13,279 --> 00:57:15,919
Don't you have to process the reel?
Don't try to fool me

728
00:57:17,153 --> 00:57:19,193
No processing is required!

729
00:57:19,398 --> 00:57:20,518
Look!

730
00:57:23,371 --> 00:57:25,851
If you've told me,
I would have posed with the glasses

731
00:57:28,699 --> 00:57:31,299
Can we take one more photo?

732
00:57:39,904 --> 00:57:43,424
Brilliant pictures
I've never seen me nicer

733
00:57:44,202 --> 00:57:47,162
You have a gangster like personality

734
00:57:47,331 --> 00:57:51,611
That's exactly what we do all this work

735
00:57:54,951 --> 00:57:56,831
I need a rapid growth in life

736
00:57:57,286 --> 00:57:59,486
I can't wait for years

737
00:57:59,617 --> 00:58:01,697
I've a 4 year old daughter

738
00:58:02,284 --> 00:58:05,524
I want to earn well...
Keep the family happy

739
00:58:05,701 --> 00:58:10,181
Then settle down with a small business

740
00:58:10,410 --> 00:58:14,850
Good drinks...and enjoy
my life to the fullest

741
00:58:15,292 --> 00:58:19,892
So, how did Sethu
become such a big shot?

742
00:58:20,166 --> 00:58:22,406
Do you know any
history behind this?

743
00:58:24,707 --> 00:58:26,187
About Sethu brother...

744
00:58:28,333 --> 00:58:30,773
What do you want to know about Sethu?

745
00:58:31,079 --> 00:58:33,279
Ask me, I'll tell you everything

746
00:58:39,664 --> 00:58:41,624
Yes

747
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:58,320
"When the beauty of
the land falls in love"

748
00:58:58,543 --> 00:59:02,743
"The rage of bull is instigated"

749
00:59:02,965 --> 00:59:07,405
"And when the seasonal flowers blossom"

750
00:59:07,630 --> 00:59:11,870
"The legendary bull fights begin"

751
00:59:12,259 --> 00:59:18,539
"The lone lady is enthralled"

752
00:59:21,259 --> 00:59:28,779
"And caught up in the web of love..."

753
00:59:29,504 --> 00:59:31,024
- Is that Sethu?
- Yes

754
00:59:31,131 --> 00:59:33,331
I took a big risk
and stole it for you

755
00:59:33,798 --> 00:59:35,638
Why do you want this?

756
00:59:36,507 --> 00:59:41,747
When I make a family subject movie,
I can use this as reference

757
00:59:42,003 --> 00:59:45,763
- It's a nice dress
- New dress

758
00:59:47,549 --> 00:59:50,669
- You bought it or stole it?
- Our company only steals Sarees

759
00:59:50,844 --> 00:59:51,964
Policies, huh?

760
00:59:52,258 --> 00:59:55,978
"The seed of love is sown"

761
00:59:56,265 --> 01:00:00,945
"These are too expensive"

762
01:00:01,222 --> 01:00:05,262
"Now we leave it to time"

763
01:00:05,470 --> 01:00:10,110
"For the side it grows"

764
01:00:10,343 --> 01:00:14,783
"When the beauty of
the land falls in love"

765
01:00:15,011 --> 01:00:19,211
"The rage of bull is instigated"

766
01:00:19,470 --> 01:00:23,830
"And when the seasonal flowers blossom"

767
01:00:24,057 --> 01:00:28,577
"The legendary bull fights begin"

768
01:00:30,016 --> 01:00:32,936
He too was once a big shot

769
01:00:41,014 --> 01:00:43,134
What are they doing together?

770
01:00:43,311 --> 01:00:45,671
Wastrel keeps company
with the wastrels

771
01:00:46,853 --> 01:00:51,333
"While the king is still getting ready"

772
01:00:51,604 --> 01:00:55,964
"The queen could hardly wait"

773
01:00:56,188 --> 01:01:00,708
"As the drama carries
on in its own pace"

774
01:01:00,938 --> 01:01:04,978
"The wait has become
too unbearable"

775
01:01:05,313 --> 01:01:09,553
"She is caught in her own trap"

776
01:01:09,767 --> 01:01:13,887
"In too deep, happily stuck"

777
01:01:14,145 --> 01:01:17,945
Rain! You!
Me! Ilayaraja!

778
01:01:20,352 --> 01:01:23,712
Haiku!
Awesome

779
01:01:26,562 --> 01:01:28,202
In a caste dispute-

780
01:01:28,312 --> 01:01:30,392
How dare you talk about her?

781
01:01:32,103 --> 01:01:33,223
No photos, you stupid

782
01:01:33,319 --> 01:01:38,519
"The lone lady is enthralled"

783
01:01:41,733 --> 01:01:47,813
"And caught up in the web of love..."

784
01:01:53,524 --> 01:01:54,964
Is Taj Mahal back drop ok?

785
01:01:55,068 --> 01:01:57,228
Change to some foreign places

786
01:01:57,355 --> 01:02:00,635
Bombay, London, Paris and likes

787
01:02:01,276 --> 01:02:03,996
She wants to visit those places

788
01:02:04,156 --> 01:02:05,236
Is it so?

789
01:02:05,404 --> 01:02:08,684
- What's her name?
- Ganga! Daughter's name is Sri Priya

790
01:02:09,155 --> 01:02:11,555
- Love marriage?
- Yes

791
01:02:12,275 --> 01:02:14,155
Why do you feel shy for that?

792
01:02:18,158 --> 01:02:19,518
Sethu brother is calling me

793
01:02:20,231 --> 01:02:22,711
Hello...!
Tell me, brother

794
01:02:23,533 --> 01:02:27,413
Ya, I'm nearby
I'll be there immediately

795
01:02:29,659 --> 01:02:31,579
Sethu himself is calling me

796
01:02:31,702 --> 01:02:32,582
Why?

797
01:02:32,659 --> 01:02:34,739
We are going to kill
someone tonight

798
01:02:36,699 --> 01:02:38,619
Who is that?
What for?

799
01:02:38,784 --> 01:02:40,584
I am not sure who

800
01:02:40,699 --> 01:02:43,619
But am sure some
big person is the target

801
01:02:43,828 --> 01:02:47,148
They usually don't call me
for such big assignment

802
01:02:47,368 --> 01:02:51,928
Other day, I stood up for myself
this is my returns for that

803
01:02:52,159 --> 01:02:53,399
Is it?

804
01:02:54,322 --> 01:02:57,322
Just wait for 10 minutes
I'll be back

805
01:02:57,494 --> 01:03:00,134
Make it fast, I need to hurry

806
01:03:01,530 --> 01:03:05,250
Hey, where have you kept
the black box that was in my bag?

807
01:03:05,452 --> 01:03:07,292
It's in the other room, why?

808
01:03:07,866 --> 01:03:11,146
We've got a great opportunity today
They are going to kill someone

809
01:03:11,326 --> 01:03:13,246
And this dumbo is also
involved in that

810
01:03:13,415 --> 01:03:15,575
And we can listen
to that incident live

811
01:03:15,752 --> 01:03:18,792
Be clear! I've lot of
clothes to wash still

812
01:03:24,707 --> 01:03:30,027
My Reporter uncle
gave me this spy mic

813
01:03:30,329 --> 01:03:34,929
This audio transmitter is
to spy on people

814
01:03:35,163 --> 01:03:41,683
I can stick this device to anything
Then we can listen to what they speak

815
01:03:42,003 --> 01:03:45,043
Clearly through this
receiver from a distance

816
01:03:45,376 --> 01:03:49,136
Clear reception for at least 1KM wide

817
01:03:49,666 --> 01:03:52,746
You sound exactly like
a tele shopping sales girl

818
01:03:52,917 --> 01:03:54,597
What are you going to do with this?

819
01:04:52,423 --> 01:04:54,703
We can see photos too?

820
01:04:54,845 --> 01:04:57,645
Photos, songs, movies...
Everything

821
01:04:58,594 --> 01:04:59,834
This is amazing

822
01:04:59,929 --> 01:05:02,649
You wanted to show pictures
to your wife, right?

823
01:05:02,804 --> 01:05:03,724
Yes

824
01:05:03,803 --> 01:05:06,843
Take it tonight
and return it tomorrow

825
01:05:08,301 --> 01:05:09,821
So I'll take it

826
01:05:10,220 --> 01:05:11,340
Thanks bro!

827
01:05:11,426 --> 01:05:15,586
- You'll return it, right?
- Hey, you can trust me

828
01:05:21,890 --> 01:05:23,330
Bye

829
01:05:25,933 --> 01:05:27,933
Come fast
Let's check

830
01:06:19,269 --> 01:06:20,989
- Hi brother
- Come

831
01:06:21,101 --> 01:06:23,741
Sethu brother himself called
What's the matter?

832
01:06:24,689 --> 01:06:27,649
You cried for not calling you
for big projects, right?

833
01:06:27,813 --> 01:06:29,573
So come and watch a big project

834
01:06:29,729 --> 01:06:33,689
To watch, I dreamt big for tonight
Who is the target?

835
01:06:34,526 --> 01:06:36,886
- Sekar
- Sekar!

836
01:06:40,442 --> 01:06:42,522
- Who is Sekar?
- Sekar is Sethu's rival for decades

837
01:06:42,696 --> 01:06:44,136
We suspected him all these days

838
01:06:44,276 --> 01:06:49,796
We have closed all other suspects

839
01:06:50,398 --> 01:06:52,158
So we are killing Sekar tonight

840
01:06:52,397 --> 01:06:55,797
He is always guarded
He is in politics too

841
01:06:55,988 --> 01:06:58,668
He has got an affair with someone
living in SS Colony 7th street

842
01:06:58,862 --> 01:07:00,382
Every Friday he settles there

843
01:07:00,489 --> 01:07:02,089
- Do you know this place?
- Yeah!

844
01:07:02,233 --> 01:07:04,793
No security
Today is Friday

845
01:07:04,946 --> 01:07:06,626
His gang is also cornered

846
01:07:06,778 --> 01:07:09,058
All his guys number
would be switched off

847
01:07:09,277 --> 01:07:10,837
So what's the plot?

848
01:07:10,944 --> 01:07:14,864
Three of our men has
surrounded the streets

849
01:07:15,068 --> 01:07:17,468
They alerted us when
Sekar entered the house

850
01:07:17,612 --> 01:07:19,372
Oh, he is already in the house?

851
01:07:20,401 --> 01:07:22,361
Kasi has studied the house for a while

852
01:07:22,484 --> 01:07:28,524
Then punctured his vehicles
And waiting on the backyard to watch him

853
01:07:29,993 --> 01:07:31,833
SS colony is a large area

854
01:07:32,535 --> 01:07:36,455
But I have a friend's house there
Let's go and sit in the terrace

855
01:07:37,366 --> 01:07:38,486
Let's start now

856
01:07:38,868 --> 01:07:42,388
We won't get signal if we start now
We won't know their next steps

857
01:07:42,619 --> 01:07:44,419
We will leave after them

858
01:07:44,868 --> 01:07:45,788
What's the time now?

859
01:07:45,867 --> 01:07:48,187
12:30!
We've half hour to go

860
01:07:49,156 --> 01:07:50,836
Go fill the fuel

861
01:07:50,992 --> 01:07:54,112
- He's going to the main road
- Let's go

862
01:08:52,666 --> 01:08:54,586
Sekar brother, important information

863
01:08:54,710 --> 01:08:56,310
They have plotted
to kill you tonight

864
01:08:56,418 --> 01:08:58,178
We'll be there in 30 minutes

865
01:08:58,995 --> 01:09:00,275
He's speaking to Sekar

866
01:09:00,373 --> 01:09:02,853
- What are you saying?
- You are in SS colony, right?

867
01:09:03,004 --> 01:09:03,844
Yes

868
01:09:03,961 --> 01:09:07,841
There are 3 people watching
you from your street corner

869
01:09:09,213 --> 01:09:11,053
What's happening?

870
01:09:13,257 --> 01:09:14,377
You're right

871
01:09:14,463 --> 01:09:17,023
They have flattened
your car tires

872
01:09:17,924 --> 01:09:19,764
The back gate is locked too

873
01:09:20,003 --> 01:09:22,523
He has leaked the entire plan

874
01:09:22,716 --> 01:09:25,316
Its a perfect plan! Sorry
I got the news late

875
01:09:25,465 --> 01:09:26,505
Just escape somehow

876
01:09:26,589 --> 01:09:30,229
Let the lights and TV be on
be careful while you escape

877
01:09:30,507 --> 01:09:32,267
They're watching you from outside

878
01:09:32,377 --> 01:09:36,177
Don't try to bring your guys
They're all trapped too

879
01:09:36,714 --> 01:09:38,354
He played a perfect double game

880
01:09:38,463 --> 01:09:42,383
Thought him to be an idiot
He's been spying on Sethu

881
01:09:42,591 --> 01:09:46,471
You've just got 30 minutes to escape

882
01:09:47,548 --> 01:09:49,828
This is a mega twist

883
01:09:52,215 --> 01:09:54,335
See, he is leaving
Follow him fast

884
01:09:54,595 --> 01:09:56,235
Follow him quick

885
01:10:59,436 --> 01:11:00,556
Brother

886
01:11:00,688 --> 01:11:04,808
No police vehicle
It's just an ambulance, you can come

887
01:11:36,732 --> 01:11:40,252
- Can you hear him?
- Wait...

888
01:11:42,231 --> 01:11:43,231
Can hear now

889
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:45,120
Looks like no one is in the house

890
01:11:45,485 --> 01:11:46,645
Break it

891
01:11:46,735 --> 01:11:48,175
Sethu has reached

892
01:12:26,826 --> 01:12:28,146
He fled the house

893
01:12:29,698 --> 01:12:30,978
Sekar has escaped

894
01:12:31,075 --> 01:12:32,435
What were you all doing?

895
01:12:32,533 --> 01:12:34,973
We were alert, no one
went out of the house

896
01:12:35,494 --> 01:12:37,894
What about the ambulance?

897
01:12:38,030 --> 01:12:40,550
We thought some emergency
case in the neighborhood

898
01:12:40,699 --> 01:12:42,699
He fled by the ambulance

899
01:12:42,863 --> 01:12:45,263
Sekar is a brilliant
fellow I guess

900
01:12:45,453 --> 01:12:48,613
He made a fool of Sethu himself,
better you take Sekar's as movie

901
01:12:49,658 --> 01:12:53,058
So he fled the place
despite all of you

902
01:12:53,743 --> 01:12:56,103
That too in an ambulance

903
01:13:01,074 --> 01:13:02,714
Why is he laughing?

904
01:13:10,285 --> 01:13:14,605
Sekar is brilliant
Isn't it Sounder?

905
01:13:31,288 --> 01:13:34,608
We can still catch
that ambulance, brother

906
01:13:34,826 --> 01:13:38,706
For what? We've already
caught the prey

907
01:13:51,415 --> 01:13:54,495
The plot is not for Sekar

908
01:13:54,707 --> 01:13:56,067
It's for you

909
01:14:00,999 --> 01:14:03,519
Rushing into everything

910
01:14:03,713 --> 01:14:07,073
You want to fly even
before you got wings

911
01:14:07,835 --> 01:14:14,035
When we recited the plot to you for
the first time, you should have sensed it

912
01:14:14,794 --> 01:14:16,554
You've a lot to learn Sounder

913
01:14:16,672 --> 01:14:20,112
Who is brilliant now?
Sethu is a master mind

914
01:14:20,424 --> 01:14:22,984
This is a brilliant scene for my movie

915
01:14:23,130 --> 01:14:25,450
He is just caught red-handed
A dumb fellow

916
01:14:25,631 --> 01:14:27,831
What are they gonna do to him?

917
01:14:28,004 --> 01:14:31,004
So you have played double-game on us?

918
01:14:31,588 --> 01:14:32,988
Getting hit

919
01:14:33,719 --> 01:14:37,079
I just agreed to let him know
if there is a plot for him

920
01:14:37,255 --> 01:14:41,375
Please believe me, bro
You are like my hero

921
01:14:41,588 --> 01:14:45,188
He took care of my monthly family expenses
That's why I agreed

922
01:14:47,922 --> 01:14:52,122
I just need to inform the plot that's it
Nothing else brother

923
01:14:52,347 --> 01:14:53,587
Listen to me

924
01:14:53,680 --> 01:14:55,840
Pardon me once

925
01:14:55,970 --> 01:14:58,530
Please speak out Rasu brother

926
01:14:58,678 --> 01:15:00,918
I beg you, bro

927
01:15:17,175 --> 01:15:18,815
He just shot him

928
01:15:38,682 --> 01:15:40,482
He killed Sounder

929
01:15:46,767 --> 01:15:49,607
Sethu, we trapped him like a mouse

930
01:15:57,060 --> 01:16:00,300
Sekar, watching Titanic?

931
01:16:03,020 --> 01:16:08,180
Seem like you are doing
a research with films these days

932
01:16:09,518 --> 01:16:11,558
Looking handsome

933
01:16:12,603 --> 01:16:15,963
- Looking good?
- Believe me, Sethu

934
01:16:16,144 --> 01:16:19,704
I didn't send him to kill you

935
01:16:19,892 --> 01:16:21,332
Just a safety net for me

936
01:16:21,432 --> 01:16:25,152
Why do you build over and over?

937
01:16:31,682 --> 01:16:33,922
He shot Sekar too

938
01:16:34,654 --> 01:16:36,734
Let's leave now
I am scared

939
01:16:46,234 --> 01:16:47,874
Die...!

940
01:16:50,481 --> 01:16:53,481
Why do you think I called you all
to catch these two silly dastards?

941
01:16:54,149 --> 01:16:57,509
Think well before
you plot against me

942
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:03,880
Take that

943
01:17:05,530 --> 01:17:07,370
Let's go now
Come on

944
01:17:08,568 --> 01:17:12,088
Some MP3 player
To listen songs

945
01:17:13,359 --> 01:17:14,639
Let's go now

946
01:17:14,732 --> 01:17:17,972
Take these dogs to our farm and
Burn them to ashes

947
01:17:20,234 --> 01:17:22,794
Brother, there is a mic stuck on this

948
01:17:25,949 --> 01:17:29,029
There is someone spying you

949
01:17:29,950 --> 01:17:33,470
It should be this dog, Sekar

950
01:17:33,657 --> 01:17:36,577
- I don't think it's him
- Then?

951
01:17:37,074 --> 01:17:39,794
This will work only in close proximity

952
01:17:40,287 --> 01:17:42,247
Its no use to him

953
01:17:42,367 --> 01:17:45,487
Also, why did he wait
until Sounder called?

954
01:17:45,656 --> 01:17:47,576
He could have fled while
you planned this plot

955
01:17:47,697 --> 01:17:51,057
It's someone else
close to the house

956
01:17:53,493 --> 01:17:56,893
Only police or reporters use this mic

957
01:17:57,407 --> 01:17:59,727
They are going to kill us now

958
01:17:59,865 --> 01:18:03,305
I told you not to get in to this

959
01:18:03,488 --> 01:18:07,688
I think he might be still listening

960
01:18:08,950 --> 01:18:10,550
Let's go somewhere...please

961
01:18:10,654 --> 01:18:12,414
Wait, let me think

962
01:18:13,123 --> 01:18:14,643
There is no escape

963
01:18:14,747 --> 01:18:17,427
Even the SI warned us

964
01:18:19,245 --> 01:18:20,165
Let's go

965
01:18:20,249 --> 01:18:21,849
Hey!

966
01:18:23,789 --> 01:18:27,269
The idiot at the other end listening

967
01:18:27,497 --> 01:18:31,017
Whoever you is...

968
01:18:32,787 --> 01:18:34,387
Listen carefully

969
01:18:35,747 --> 01:18:38,787
You will be dead in an hour...

970
01:18:41,622 --> 01:18:43,862
...with my own hands

971
01:18:51,873 --> 01:18:53,873
Let's just run from here

972
01:18:55,622 --> 01:18:59,262
Definitely they'll kill us
Ruthless killers

973
01:19:00,165 --> 01:19:01,885
My whole life...

974
01:19:09,125 --> 01:19:11,445
Hurry up, there is
no time to cry

975
01:19:11,590 --> 01:19:13,630
They might not have suspected us

976
01:19:13,796 --> 01:19:16,196
They will be behind
Ganesh and gang

977
01:19:16,382 --> 01:19:21,662
Let's run before it's late
We'll leave tonight

978
01:19:21,961 --> 01:19:24,761
Where...where will I go?

979
01:19:25,006 --> 01:19:27,486
I am going to die without
even seeing my kid

980
01:19:29,671 --> 01:19:34,271
Don't get scared, we can talk later
Let's pack and leave

981
01:19:34,507 --> 01:19:37,067
Come on Oorni
Let's go!

982
01:20:54,727 --> 01:20:57,167
They are not breaking the silence

983
01:20:57,352 --> 01:21:00,032
Every one we catch
are like terrorists

984
01:21:00,226 --> 01:21:03,346
Why keep bothering them,
just kill them

985
01:21:04,602 --> 01:21:06,882
They are here
to keep an eye on us

986
01:21:07,481 --> 01:21:10,481
Don't know whether they are
police or some other gang

987
01:21:10,645 --> 01:21:12,765
They are police Bro

988
01:21:12,893 --> 01:21:17,853
Look they have got the case file,
as well tracked us with a mic

989
01:21:18,104 --> 01:21:20,024
Definitely Police

990
01:21:20,184 --> 01:21:24,424
What are you contemplating bro?
Let's kill them quick and go home

991
01:21:24,644 --> 01:21:27,484
Have to take my dad
to the hospital in the morning

992
01:21:28,602 --> 01:21:33,242
Ok then you start now,
We'll take care

993
01:21:33,524 --> 01:21:36,044
Ok bro, I'll leave now

994
01:21:38,606 --> 01:21:42,006
Please tell them the truth

995
01:21:42,523 --> 01:21:44,803
They will burn us alive
if we tell the truth

996
01:21:44,982 --> 01:21:47,702
If you don't
are they gonna treat us?

997
01:21:48,316 --> 01:21:51,996
They think we are a policemen
Do tell the truth

998
01:21:57,858 --> 01:22:00,018
Look at these spy faces

999
01:22:13,650 --> 01:22:14,730
Okay

1000
01:22:17,151 --> 01:22:18,271
Finish them

1001
01:22:18,693 --> 01:22:20,093
Get the tools

1002
01:22:20,401 --> 01:22:22,161
They will kills us
Please tell the truth

1003
01:22:22,283 --> 01:22:24,323
What are you guys murmuring?
Speak out loud

1004
01:22:24,451 --> 01:22:26,011
- We are not police
- Then...?

1005
01:22:26,156 --> 01:22:28,356
I came here to write a story

1006
01:22:28,613 --> 01:22:29,853
What story?

1007
01:22:29,949 --> 01:22:33,349
- A movie script
- He is a director

1008
01:22:33,659 --> 01:22:36,539
Ohh you are
a cinema director?

1009
01:22:37,365 --> 01:22:39,125
Sethu brother please believe me

1010
01:22:39,280 --> 01:22:41,480
A producer found me
I came to do research...

1011
01:22:41,614 --> 01:22:43,734
...to watch you in person
Make your life a movie

1012
01:22:52,033 --> 01:22:53,313
What did you say?

1013
01:22:53,614 --> 01:22:56,694
Gonna take a movie based
on your life story

1014
01:22:56,865 --> 01:22:57,985
About my life?

1015
01:22:58,075 --> 01:23:00,595
Hence came to write
a story here

1016
01:23:00,781 --> 01:23:03,341
That's why I spied you

1017
01:23:03,527 --> 01:23:04,607
Movie?

1018
01:23:05,202 --> 01:23:07,202
Like the one
which comes in TV

1019
01:23:07,324 --> 01:23:10,844
Reality shows, following criminals

1020
01:23:11,075 --> 01:23:15,115
No, It's like Godfather,
Scarface, something like that

1021
01:23:31,703 --> 01:23:34,943
How can I believe you?

1022
01:23:35,123 --> 01:23:37,483
Mahesh is also a good boy

1023
01:23:37,624 --> 01:23:39,104
How many times
should I tell you?

1024
01:23:46,540 --> 01:23:47,620
Good

1025
01:23:48,207 --> 01:23:50,087
But the movie duration is less

1026
01:23:52,453 --> 01:23:53,853
They are short films

1027
01:23:53,954 --> 01:23:57,114
But your story
would be a feature film

1028
01:23:57,539 --> 01:23:59,739
Big film, right?

1029
01:24:01,164 --> 01:24:03,364
If you need some information
you should have come directly

1030
01:24:03,502 --> 01:24:07,342
Why all these unnecessary spy
stuffs, get yourself hurt

1031
01:24:07,712 --> 01:24:11,312
You burnt a reporter alive
for writing about you

1032
01:24:11,673 --> 01:24:12,793
That's why?

1033
01:24:14,385 --> 01:24:16,825
He is a reporter
who writes the truth

1034
01:24:17,254 --> 01:24:18,494
That is very dangerous

1035
01:24:18,587 --> 01:24:20,347
You are gonna make a movie

1036
01:24:20,504 --> 01:24:23,584
Like Godfather, Scarface

1037
01:24:24,714 --> 01:24:27,194
It will be good to see
my story in theatres

1038
01:24:27,338 --> 01:24:28,338
What you say guys?

1039
01:24:28,461 --> 01:24:29,501
Yes brother

1040
01:24:33,503 --> 01:24:37,223
Hereafter any information
you need, just ask me

1041
01:24:37,587 --> 01:24:39,347
Because it's our film

1042
01:24:39,503 --> 01:24:41,383
A film about me

1043
01:24:42,005 --> 01:24:47,085
Guys...they belong to our gang

1044
01:24:52,926 --> 01:24:54,406
Let's Start

1045
01:24:54,719 --> 01:24:55,759
Just a minute

1046
01:24:57,637 --> 01:24:58,717
No...

1047
01:24:59,551 --> 01:25:01,111
Just be casual

1048
01:25:01,677 --> 01:25:03,197
- Don't want this?
- Nope

1049
01:25:05,468 --> 01:25:06,668
Rolling!

1050
01:25:10,381 --> 01:25:12,781
You tell, I am feeling uneasy

1051
01:25:12,969 --> 01:25:14,729
I can't do that

1052
01:25:15,176 --> 01:25:17,656
- At least you narrate
- I can't do that

1053
01:25:18,262 --> 01:25:19,502
What is this?

1054
01:25:20,846 --> 01:25:24,166
You feel different to narrate
in front of the camera

1055
01:25:24,348 --> 01:25:26,708
I'll get the other phone,
we can do a voice recording

1056
01:25:26,846 --> 01:25:29,486
That's alright
First time before camera...

1057
01:25:30,260 --> 01:25:32,620
What should I say?

1058
01:25:32,803 --> 01:25:36,843
Today you're big shot
When and where did it all started?

1059
01:25:37,054 --> 01:25:37,974
Say that

1060
01:25:38,053 --> 01:25:40,133
Right from my childhood,
my dreams, ambition...

1061
01:25:40,302 --> 01:25:43,262
...vision everything
is being a Gangster

1062
01:25:44,642 --> 01:25:48,402
During my 3rd standard we had
a stage drama in our school

1063
01:25:48,808 --> 01:25:50,288
Panchali Sabatham

1064
01:25:52,020 --> 01:25:53,500
I am Droupathi

1065
01:25:53,645 --> 01:25:58,005
Durchathanan removes my saree
and Krishna failed to hold my saree

1066
01:25:58,268 --> 01:26:01,588
I stood as a shameless goose
in front of everyone

1067
01:26:01,980 --> 01:26:05,820
All those guys around
me laughed at me

1068
01:26:10,601 --> 01:26:14,761
I can never accept
anyone mocking me

1069
01:26:15,435 --> 01:26:18,475
That's when I got
powered up and beat them

1070
01:26:18,809 --> 01:26:21,649
- No...no
- Sethu, let him go

1071
01:26:21,807 --> 01:26:24,527
Out of fear,  when everyone
paves way for us-

1072
01:26:27,102 --> 01:26:28,222
You'll feel a high

1073
01:26:28,349 --> 01:26:32,869
Once you've felt it,
you can never get over it

1074
01:26:33,107 --> 01:26:34,907
That's where it all started

1075
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:38,800
From then you beat
for every reason...

1076
01:26:39,023 --> 01:26:40,863
...and beat every person

1077
01:26:47,069 --> 01:26:51,149
School issues, college issues,
and area issues...

1078
01:26:51,353 --> 01:26:56,593
Ego issues, Issues between
two gangs, in this race...

1079
01:26:56,860 --> 01:27:00,460
We din't even have time to
sleep, we were more into issues...

1080
01:27:00,650 --> 01:27:03,890
...problems and fights
till a point of time

1081
01:27:09,650 --> 01:27:13,890
Most of them turned to rogue
because of a love story

1082
01:27:14,108 --> 01:27:18,428
Even our life had a twist,
because of his love story

1083
01:27:20,567 --> 01:27:24,607
During our college days
To see your lover in their locality...

1084
01:27:24,866 --> 01:27:26,666
...is like a war mission

1085
01:27:33,907 --> 01:27:39,947
One day when he went to see his lover,
her brother caught us red handed

1086
01:27:40,282 --> 01:27:41,802
Who are they?

1087
01:27:41,910 --> 01:27:43,790
Finish it quick,
they're coming here

1088
01:27:46,281 --> 01:27:48,521
Let's leave now
You want us to run and hide

1089
01:27:48,696 --> 01:27:51,856
- Who is her brother?
- The one with the black scarf

1090
01:27:52,034 --> 01:27:53,754
Who are you?

1091
01:27:54,492 --> 01:27:56,372
You're from Jaihindpuram
locality, right?

1092
01:27:56,492 --> 01:27:57,132
Yes

1093
01:27:57,201 --> 01:27:58,801
What the damn
are you doing here?

1094
01:27:58,906 --> 01:28:00,706
He came to drool
with his sister

1095
01:28:00,864 --> 01:28:02,984
I came to beat black and blue
if anybody talk rude with us

1096
01:28:03,113 --> 01:28:04,673
You think you're a big...

1097
01:28:08,407 --> 01:28:12,127
At that time that locality had
a big rogue named Murugan

1098
01:28:12,372 --> 01:28:14,772
I've never seen him before

1099
01:28:14,956 --> 01:28:16,596
What's the problem guys?

1100
01:28:16,702 --> 01:28:18,982
These guys have come
to meet my sister

1101
01:28:19,123 --> 01:28:21,003
I just asked him
but he is trying to hit me

1102
01:28:21,123 --> 01:28:23,443
Which locality you guys are from?
Is it Jaihindpuram?

1103
01:28:23,619 --> 01:28:24,179
Yes

1104
01:28:24,248 --> 01:28:26,008
Won't your locality
have any girls?

1105
01:28:26,121 --> 01:28:29,361
We've got lot of women there
But we heard there isn't any men here

1106
01:28:29,538 --> 01:28:30,338
You...?

1107
01:28:39,083 --> 01:28:41,563
He struck Murugan
Let's run away

1108
01:28:41,707 --> 01:28:45,307
That incident took my name
and reputation to next level

1109
01:28:45,540 --> 01:28:48,020
Then had a peace talk
with murugan group

1110
01:28:48,166 --> 01:28:51,406
I apologised
and we closed that chapter

1111
01:28:51,578 --> 01:28:53,498
But I made
a mark on his face

1112
01:28:54,040 --> 01:28:56,960
When he sees that mark on mirror
he will always remember me

1113
01:28:57,541 --> 01:29:00,141
People like us, we never settle

1114
01:29:03,335 --> 01:29:05,015
Are you Sethu?

1115
01:29:05,544 --> 01:29:07,504
You scarred Murugan's face

1116
01:29:08,128 --> 01:29:09,568
Do you think yourself
to be a big shot?

1117
01:29:09,711 --> 01:29:11,831
Don't mess with me

1118
01:29:11,963 --> 01:29:15,803
Hereafter if I get to
hear any news about you,

1119
01:29:16,002 --> 01:29:18,442
I myself will kill you

1120
01:29:20,336 --> 01:29:22,096
Look at his face

1121
01:29:23,337 --> 01:29:27,497
We can't live here
opposing Shanmugham

1122
01:29:27,713 --> 01:29:28,713
So...

1123
01:29:29,293 --> 01:29:31,973
- Let's move away now
- Did they beat you?

1124
01:29:32,175 --> 01:29:32,815
Yes

1125
01:29:34,214 --> 01:29:37,134
Sir...come and see this

1126
01:29:37,293 --> 01:29:39,333
Both of them
are lying dead here, sir

1127
01:29:39,505 --> 01:29:40,985
Stay there
Don't come close

1128
01:29:41,085 --> 01:29:42,125
Is it Murugan?

1129
01:29:42,210 --> 01:29:43,890
Murugan as well

1130
01:29:44,047 --> 01:29:46,287
My death is not in his hands

1131
01:29:46,422 --> 01:29:50,142
I stabbed that
rogue to death

1132
01:29:50,340 --> 01:29:52,060
There they are, catch them

1133
01:30:00,010 --> 01:30:01,970
Move...move away

1134
01:30:02,095 --> 01:30:05,335
That's my first execution

1135
01:30:05,966 --> 01:30:09,166
But a big and best execution

1136
01:30:09,339 --> 01:30:12,499
You become a gangster,
only by killing someone

1137
01:30:12,717 --> 01:30:14,677
Way of execution
and the number of murders

1138
01:30:14,846 --> 01:30:17,526
Determines his respect,
worth and everything

1139
01:30:18,138 --> 01:30:21,458
Every murder is
like a medal of honour

1140
01:30:21,847 --> 01:30:24,087
So far how many?

1141
01:30:24,554 --> 01:30:26,554
You alone did 18

1142
01:30:26,679 --> 01:30:29,319
We all together did

1143
01:30:29,512 --> 01:30:30,752
- I am 13
- Me 5

1144
01:30:30,884 --> 01:30:31,844
I am 4

1145
01:30:32,719 --> 01:30:34,119
All together 48

1146
01:30:37,387 --> 01:30:38,507
Totally 48 murders

1147
01:30:39,928 --> 01:30:45,128
If we would have killed you both,
we could have celebrated the half century

1148
01:30:46,103 --> 01:30:47,463
What do you say?

1149
01:30:47,890 --> 01:30:49,050
Great escape

1150
01:30:55,642 --> 01:30:57,882
Then what happened?
What happened?

1151
01:30:58,019 --> 01:31:01,419
We both were taking each
other group members lives

1152
01:31:01,597 --> 01:31:03,837
In the name of revenge

1153
01:31:04,021 --> 01:31:06,861
Then spending a lot of money to get
ourselves out of police cases

1154
01:31:07,018 --> 01:31:09,218
Again to earn money getting
us involved in,

1155
01:31:09,391 --> 01:31:11,951
High interest rates lending,
politics, fruit market lease etc...

1156
01:31:12,103 --> 01:31:14,263
To safeguard us we kill 4 enemies

1157
01:31:14,393 --> 01:31:16,273
In turn they're
waiting to kill us

1158
01:31:16,435 --> 01:31:18,355
Our job runs like this

1159
01:31:18,515 --> 01:31:22,515
We enter the business taking a life,
and you have to pay with your life to get out

1160
01:31:22,725 --> 01:31:24,125
That's our profession

1161
01:31:30,107 --> 01:31:31,587
Should live like a King

1162
01:31:32,149 --> 01:31:35,629
With pride and honour

1163
01:31:36,356 --> 01:31:40,276
For that to happen,
do anything, kill anyone

1164
01:31:40,648 --> 01:31:41,848
That's not wrong

1165
01:31:41,985 --> 01:31:44,025
This is our policy

1166
01:31:45,025 --> 01:31:46,425
Any more questions?

1167
01:31:48,438 --> 01:31:49,758
About your Mom and Dad?

1168
01:31:53,855 --> 01:31:56,615
My dad died
in a mill accident

1169
01:31:56,819 --> 01:31:59,419
My sibling died
at a young age

1170
01:31:59,609 --> 01:32:05,529
One who is sitting there,
that's my Mom

1171
01:32:07,147 --> 01:32:09,547
She hates my business completely

1172
01:32:09,732 --> 01:32:12,132
She said she won't speak,
if I don't quit

1173
01:32:12,817 --> 01:32:14,697
She told that 12 years ago

1174
01:32:15,234 --> 01:32:17,194
Till now haven't spoken a word

1175
01:32:19,025 --> 01:32:20,505
My Mom right?

1176
01:32:21,068 --> 01:32:22,468
How do you expect then?

1177
01:32:27,488 --> 01:32:28,568
Anything else?

1178
01:32:29,906 --> 01:32:31,866
Out of all your criminal records,

1179
01:32:31,993 --> 01:32:35,673
Interesting fights,
kidnaps and murders

1180
01:32:35,865 --> 01:32:39,305
If you could elaborate, it will be easy
to be shoot as a scene in the movie

1181
01:32:41,530 --> 01:32:45,290
Which one we can say,
the bus stand incident

1182
01:32:45,489 --> 01:32:46,689
Which one?

1183
01:32:46,822 --> 01:32:50,782
The political issue for
which I was imprisoned

1184
01:32:53,033 --> 01:32:56,233
That one he had 4 cuts,
but still was alive

1185
01:32:56,447 --> 01:32:58,087
So we stomped him
by his neck

1186
01:32:58,236 --> 01:33:00,556
We had a lorry run over his body

1187
01:33:00,904 --> 01:33:03,664
The tall one we killed
in the market fight

1188
01:33:04,240 --> 01:33:05,520
You mean the love story?

1189
01:33:05,660 --> 01:33:08,300
- I gave a sharp blow
- Just one stroke he ran away

1190
01:33:13,373 --> 01:33:16,973
We get a big cut of our revenue
from settling issues

1191
01:33:17,160 --> 01:33:19,480
Sekar, tell yourself
where will we go?

1192
01:33:19,619 --> 01:33:21,699
Why did you arrange for this meeting,
what's the matter?

1193
01:33:21,915 --> 01:33:23,315
You are a big torture

1194
01:33:23,414 --> 01:33:26,734
Fear of the people
is the only investment in this

1195
01:33:26,954 --> 01:33:28,674
I'll slit you
just sit down

1196
01:33:28,829 --> 01:33:31,229
Everyone sit down please

1197
01:33:38,204 --> 01:33:39,884
Now tell me
what's the issue?

1198
01:33:39,998 --> 01:33:42,558
He is a drunkard and he has
an extra marital affair too

1199
01:33:42,709 --> 01:33:44,629
So I won't let my daughter
to live with him

1200
01:33:44,791 --> 01:33:45,991
Hey...stop

1201
01:33:46,079 --> 01:33:48,239
Every case we attend
has got a package

1202
01:33:48,373 --> 01:33:50,733
A package just to
make some noise

1203
01:33:50,871 --> 01:33:53,391
A package to hurt others
and a separate one to kill

1204
01:33:53,538 --> 01:33:55,898
If I go then it's 10 lakhs rupees

1205
01:33:56,079 --> 01:33:58,159
If it's Rasu 5 lakhs rupees

1206
01:33:58,288 --> 01:34:00,728
If it's Senthil 3 lakhs rupees

1207
01:34:01,409 --> 01:34:03,529
How can a woman
live with a drunkard?

1208
01:34:03,668 --> 01:34:06,308
Only a very few in this
world doesn't drink

1209
01:34:06,460 --> 01:34:09,420
But that doesn't mean
we have to divorce them

1210
01:34:09,584 --> 01:34:11,424
- Stop it
- Start a fight

1211
01:34:11,543 --> 01:34:13,263
- What did you say?
- Just shut up

1212
01:34:13,419 --> 01:34:16,459
Just stop it
Won't you listen you drunkard?

1213
01:34:24,797 --> 01:34:30,637
29, 30, 31, 32nd cut
can't be shown

1214
01:34:31,755 --> 01:34:34,155
This one is to hurt
and this one is to kill

1215
01:34:34,297 --> 01:34:35,857
Different weapon to kill

1216
01:34:36,009 --> 01:34:37,089
What is this?

1217
01:34:37,169 --> 01:34:39,969
- Development fund
- For which party?

1218
01:34:41,377 --> 01:34:42,937
For the winning party

1219
01:35:08,088 --> 01:35:10,408
- Chicken gravy...
- Eat well

1220
01:35:10,677 --> 01:35:12,957
How dare you pour
gravy on his hand?

1221
01:35:16,718 --> 01:35:19,638
Don't you know what to
speak and how to speak

1222
01:35:19,845 --> 01:35:21,685
Sethu bro, battery drained
Give me 5 minutes

1223
01:35:21,806 --> 01:35:24,006
He gave me a Korean
movie, amazing one

1224
01:35:24,138 --> 01:35:26,698
Don't you know what to
speak and how to speak

1225
01:35:26,886 --> 01:35:29,766
- Who is this?
- Has come from Madras

1226
01:35:29,928 --> 01:35:31,808
Here to shoot a movie about Sethu

1227
01:35:31,973 --> 01:35:33,413
So he is moving with us

1228
01:35:33,510 --> 01:35:34,990
About our Sethu!

1229
01:35:35,094 --> 01:35:36,854
All those fights and murders

1230
01:35:36,972 --> 01:35:38,652
- Yes
- Very good

1231
01:35:47,934 --> 01:35:49,454
Put your signature

1232
01:35:49,560 --> 01:35:51,560
- I won't even if I die
- Here...!

1233
01:35:51,726 --> 01:35:53,486
How long you will
threaten in the same way?

1234
01:35:53,601 --> 01:35:55,001
You have got pistol right?

1235
01:35:55,142 --> 01:35:57,542
As per company rules
shouldn't use pistols

1236
01:35:57,684 --> 01:36:00,804
Just to threaten him,
I have watched it in an English film

1237
01:36:06,268 --> 01:36:07,788
What they did in the movie?

1238
01:36:10,975 --> 01:36:13,095
Let fate decide
your chance... er

1239
01:36:13,682 --> 01:36:16,082
Let your fate decide how many
chances do you need to sign the papers

1240
01:36:16,269 --> 01:36:19,709
Let your fate decide how many
chances you get to sign the papers

1241
01:36:22,183 --> 01:36:23,423
You and your nonsense idea

1242
01:36:23,518 --> 01:36:26,158
He may die, if Sethu bro
knows this, it will be a mess

1243
01:36:26,308 --> 01:36:27,508
Get him quick

1244
01:36:28,852 --> 01:36:35,012
One day had a guy
caught by his neck,

1245
01:36:35,607 --> 01:36:39,607
Started cutting his
throat with a blade

1246
01:36:39,857 --> 01:36:43,937
The blood was shedding
like a fountain for 2 feet

1247
01:36:44,148 --> 01:36:45,028
Is it?

1248
01:36:45,104 --> 01:36:49,504
This guy will cut with a blade
and the bloodshed like a fountain

1249
01:36:49,730 --> 01:36:51,050
Who will believe this?

1250
01:36:51,481 --> 01:36:53,361
- You don't believe it
- No

1251
01:36:54,356 --> 01:36:55,996
You don't believe it!

1252
01:36:56,777 --> 01:36:58,337
Wanna watch it?

1253
01:37:00,568 --> 01:37:03,728
Just catch the neck
like this and-

1254
01:37:04,067 --> 01:37:07,027
With this blade-

1255
01:37:17,692 --> 01:37:21,092
- What happened?
- Horrible murder in my dreams

1256
01:37:21,399 --> 01:37:23,479
To show you
a demo they cut my neck

1257
01:37:25,530 --> 01:37:27,530
This is how you clapped
in my dream too

1258
01:37:27,695 --> 01:37:30,535
I could smell blood even
when I brush the teeth

1259
01:37:30,739 --> 01:37:32,939
Is it really important
to write a gangster story

1260
01:37:33,115 --> 01:37:39,115
Don't we have any other stories,
maybe on our freedom fighters

1261
01:37:39,406 --> 01:37:41,166
Brilliant script is ready

1262
01:37:41,699 --> 01:37:43,619
Just need to go
and meet the producer

1263
01:37:43,783 --> 01:37:46,023
Then we will fix
Vijay Sethupathi in the lead role

1264
01:37:46,155 --> 01:37:47,675
Then it's the shoot

1265
01:37:47,781 --> 01:37:49,101
Thank God
Leave the place

1266
01:37:54,030 --> 01:37:56,150
Who's knocking there
the back door at midnight?

1267
01:37:58,444 --> 01:38:00,444
- Go!
- You go and have a look

1268
01:38:12,039 --> 01:38:14,839
Kayal, why at this odd time?

1269
01:38:14,995 --> 01:38:17,435
You still remember my name

1270
01:38:31,873 --> 01:38:35,273
Why do you keep weeping?

1271
01:38:36,664 --> 01:38:39,744
You didn't bother to meet me

1272
01:38:40,458 --> 01:38:42,258
How many calls and SMS

1273
01:38:42,415 --> 01:38:44,255
Sorry I was busy at work

1274
01:38:46,456 --> 01:38:48,056
Leaving home tomorrow?

1275
01:38:48,911 --> 01:38:51,191
Is your work done?

1276
01:38:52,579 --> 01:38:56,259
This love was just an act
to know about Sethu, is it?

1277
01:39:05,086 --> 01:39:06,286
Tell me Karthik,

1278
01:39:07,336 --> 01:39:08,856
Did you use me?

1279
01:39:18,711 --> 01:39:21,031
Kayal...Kayal

1280
01:39:25,292 --> 01:39:26,332
You're right

1281
01:39:28,128 --> 01:39:30,288
Yes, I did use you as
a bait to get information

1282
01:39:32,876 --> 01:39:35,036
But I like you a lot Kayal

1283
01:39:37,960 --> 01:39:40,240
I don't want this
love, marriage...

1284
01:39:41,585 --> 01:39:43,385
No such ideas

1285
01:39:46,086 --> 01:39:48,006
Let's be friends

1286
01:39:58,762 --> 01:40:00,122
I loved you

1287
01:40:01,969 --> 01:40:03,449
I already have other friends

1288
01:40:33,678 --> 01:40:36,278
Just concentrate on your work

1289
01:40:36,428 --> 01:40:39,308
If you start falling for this love,
You will never make a movie

1290
01:40:39,470 --> 01:40:44,550
You'll only make it to
the theatre with your family

1291
01:40:45,265 --> 01:40:48,065
Guys, Sethu brother is calling you

1292
01:40:49,181 --> 01:40:50,421
What is the matter?

1293
01:40:50,558 --> 01:40:53,718
There is a small party
for your farewell

1294
01:40:53,890 --> 01:40:54,930
Party!

1295
01:41:02,018 --> 01:41:03,978
- Where?
- Come

1296
01:41:04,517 --> 01:41:07,157
Inside a well?
See this setup

1297
01:41:07,309 --> 01:41:10,229
How's the setup?

1298
01:41:53,809 --> 01:41:58,409
"I am the lion that creates an
impression of respect in its every form"

1299
01:41:58,693 --> 01:42:01,093
"Dare not to touch me"

1300
01:42:02,694 --> 01:42:05,574
"I am a raging bull"

1301
01:42:07,857 --> 01:42:10,217
"The city speaks of my name"

1302
01:42:10,357 --> 01:42:18,077
"My name, when spelt
Spreads an aura of strength"

1303
01:42:32,365 --> 01:42:35,205
You've just finished the first draft
Lets celebrate

1304
01:42:37,488 --> 01:42:38,528
No need

1305
01:42:38,655 --> 01:42:41,375
Drown the feelings and enjoy

1306
01:42:44,366 --> 01:42:45,686
Have it

1307
01:42:48,775 --> 01:42:49,775
Come on

1308
01:43:23,329 --> 01:43:27,289
"I’ll hunt you down"

1309
01:43:27,867 --> 01:43:32,387
"I’ll beat you straight"

1310
01:43:32,617 --> 01:43:37,857
"Every blow will echo through your life
That you shatter in every direction"

1311
01:43:42,497 --> 01:43:46,537
"Understand the strength
of my city united"

1312
01:43:46,958 --> 01:43:51,678
"Understand the strength of
punishment and violence"

1313
01:43:51,957 --> 01:43:52,877
Mom...?

1314
01:43:53,037 --> 01:44:02,357
"Spreads an aura of strength"

1315
01:44:10,673 --> 01:44:14,873
"The nook and corner
of the city respects me"

1316
01:44:15,125 --> 01:44:19,565
"Success finds me time and again"

1317
01:44:20,002 --> 01:44:24,882
"The respect and fear
for strength brings it to me"

1318
01:44:29,502 --> 01:44:33,862
"Even the mountains won't
reach farther than my fists"

1319
01:44:34,086 --> 01:44:38,766
"When I clench them even
the volcano calms down"

1320
01:44:41,337 --> 01:44:48,377
"Spreads an aura of strength"

1321
01:44:49,590 --> 01:44:54,470
"I am the lion that creates an
impression of respect in its every form"

1322
01:44:54,760 --> 01:45:01,520
"Spreads an aura of strength"

1323
01:45:09,341 --> 01:45:13,261
Karthi, you are gonna
direct my life as a movie

1324
01:45:14,510 --> 01:45:16,510
I am very happy
and excited today

1325
01:45:16,637 --> 01:45:19,357
How has it come?

1326
01:45:24,095 --> 01:45:28,855
Make sure the lead role
is played by big stars

1327
01:45:29,594 --> 01:45:32,794
Cast Super Star,
it'll be unbeatable

1328
01:45:33,219 --> 01:45:36,979
They won't even
let us near his street

1329
01:45:37,221 --> 01:45:39,061
Kamal Hasan will suit
this character

1330
01:45:39,173 --> 01:45:42,293
I am Okay!
But he should say okay right

1331
01:45:42,515 --> 01:45:46,475
Sister you tell who can
be in the lead role?

1332
01:45:46,722 --> 01:45:52,202
She knows a lot about
the movies, you suggest

1333
01:45:52,851 --> 01:45:54,611
Tell whom do you want to
act in the lead role?

1334
01:45:54,724 --> 01:45:57,244
Who will be apt for this story
Rajini, Kamal, Ajit or Vijay?

1335
01:45:57,390 --> 01:45:59,110
You choose, we'll bring them

1336
01:46:05,974 --> 01:46:09,894
If the story is about Sethu,
then why someone else should act?

1337
01:46:10,139 --> 01:46:12,899
He himself can act
He looks like a hero only

1338
01:46:18,139 --> 01:46:20,379
Don't be sarcastic Kayal

1339
01:46:20,556 --> 01:46:23,556
What's wrong in her comment?
Sethu has got all the features

1340
01:46:23,724 --> 01:46:26,484
He looks like our
old hero Jaychandran

1341
01:46:28,851 --> 01:46:30,691
Why are they laughing?

1342
01:46:46,148 --> 01:46:49,988
I am not sarcastic
Some Dick and Harry are acting,

1343
01:46:50,232 --> 01:46:51,472
Why can't you?

1344
01:46:52,233 --> 01:46:55,753
By doing this you
can become famous

1345
01:46:55,979 --> 01:46:58,539
Then this stardom will be
easy to get on to politics

1346
01:46:58,732 --> 01:47:00,652
Then all your criminal
cases can be dropped

1347
01:47:00,815 --> 01:47:03,215
We have to grow up quickly
to the next level

1348
01:47:11,649 --> 01:47:16,089
No one thought about it
Even I didn’t think about it

1349
01:47:22,862 --> 01:47:24,222
What you say Karthik?

1350
01:47:25,362 --> 01:47:28,122
I will act as a hero in our film

1351
01:47:32,535 --> 01:47:34,855
Brother!
Don't make fun of it

1352
01:47:34,987 --> 01:47:37,307
I am not cracking jokes Karthik

1353
01:47:37,446 --> 01:47:40,046
I am the Hero in our film

1354
01:47:40,198 --> 01:47:45,358
She's crazy, don't
take her seriously

1355
01:47:45,655 --> 01:47:47,495
- Acting is not-
- Stop it

1356
01:47:49,902 --> 01:47:52,622
I didn’t ask your permission,

1357
01:47:52,904 --> 01:47:54,344
I'm telling you

1358
01:47:54,782 --> 01:47:56,862
I film
I hero

1359
01:47:58,321 --> 01:47:59,361
Okay?

1360
01:48:04,866 --> 01:48:06,026
Beat the drum

1361
01:48:41,124 --> 01:48:42,484
Good morning!

1362
01:48:44,997 --> 01:48:48,917
Have blabbered a lot in the night

1363
01:48:49,121 --> 01:48:50,641
Don't keep those in your mind

1364
01:48:50,787 --> 01:48:51,827
Thank God!

1365
01:48:51,998 --> 01:48:54,638
I was afraid thinking
that to be serious

1366
01:48:55,287 --> 01:48:57,287
It's okay
Come inside

1367
01:48:57,412 --> 01:48:59,132
I have got a guest at my home

1368
01:48:59,245 --> 01:49:02,165
He wants to meet you
Please come

1369
01:49:02,792 --> 01:49:04,152
Shall we go?

1370
01:49:05,001 --> 01:49:06,361
- Have they come?
- Yes

1371
01:49:10,377 --> 01:49:14,017
Sethu bro, is he the director?

1372
01:49:14,252 --> 01:49:17,332
He is the director

1373
01:49:25,501 --> 01:49:27,861
Sir is our guest

1374
01:49:36,295 --> 01:49:37,335
Sir...?

1375
01:49:42,794 --> 01:49:44,954
Have discussed everything with Sir

1376
01:49:45,130 --> 01:49:49,330
The hero in the movie that
you gonna direct in his production

1377
01:49:49,588 --> 01:49:50,948
...will be me

1378
01:49:51,094 --> 01:49:52,894
- What sir?
- For sure!

1379
01:49:54,258 --> 01:49:59,378
I am so proud to introduce
you to the film industry

1380
01:50:05,633 --> 01:50:07,953
What's wrong in him
playing the lead role?

1381
01:50:08,133 --> 01:50:10,013
He looks good like Jayachandran

1382
01:50:11,549 --> 01:50:13,149
This is my life

1383
01:50:13,548 --> 01:50:15,228
My passion and Dream

1384
01:50:16,506 --> 01:50:17,786
Who the damn is he?

1385
01:50:18,176 --> 01:50:19,736
What the hell
he knows about acting?

1386
01:50:19,930 --> 01:50:21,570
Acting is an art

1387
01:50:22,177 --> 01:50:24,297
Who the damn
is he to perform art?

1388
01:50:24,433 --> 01:50:27,393
Cinema is not a whore house where
anyone with money can come in

1389
01:50:27,593 --> 01:50:31,033
With the time spent on an emotional speech,
better do think about the solution

1390
01:50:31,220 --> 01:50:34,820
I don't have an option
Have to escape tonight

1391
01:50:35,053 --> 01:50:36,013
How?

1392
01:50:36,345 --> 01:50:40,305
Do go by the cross streets
Be careful and take care

1393
01:50:40,507 --> 01:50:42,107
- Don't get caught
- Sorry, dude

1394
01:50:42,223 --> 01:50:43,983
I have troubled you a lot

1395
01:50:44,100 --> 01:50:45,820
I can manage these troubles

1396
01:50:45,973 --> 01:50:49,013
But I can't tolerate
seeing Sethu as a Hero

1397
01:50:50,182 --> 01:50:51,702
- See you dude
- Bye

1398
01:51:07,597 --> 01:51:09,877
I bought it just for you

1399
01:51:11,269 --> 01:51:12,749
Super!

1400
01:51:56,481 --> 01:51:58,801
Did you get caught?

1401
01:52:03,234 --> 01:52:06,354
I was emotionally driven, thinking
that we will meet after many years

1402
01:52:06,563 --> 01:52:08,523
You left during
the movie title card

1403
01:52:08,648 --> 01:52:10,808
And you are back before
the movie hero's introduction

1404
01:52:10,986 --> 01:52:12,786
Hey look at our
hero's introduction now

1405
01:52:18,273 --> 01:52:20,233
Sethu, please leave me

1406
01:52:20,435 --> 01:52:22,875
Leave me Sethu please

1407
01:52:23,402 --> 01:52:27,842
Sethu bro, please let him go

1408
01:52:32,324 --> 01:52:33,844
Let me go, please

1409
01:52:57,611 --> 01:53:00,411
Do I look like a Joker?

1410
01:53:08,158 --> 01:53:10,878
How long would it take for me
to nail you in the coffin?

1411
01:53:17,077 --> 01:53:20,917
All the fear you had looking
at me from a distance,

1412
01:53:21,746 --> 01:53:24,986
Fear goes away once I made
you part of the gang

1413
01:53:27,076 --> 01:53:31,356
Either direct a film
with me as a hero

1414
01:53:31,618 --> 01:53:35,498
Otherwise just sit there
and think about your career

1415
01:53:35,743 --> 01:53:38,383
You have got only 2 options

1416
01:53:38,829 --> 01:53:39,989
Understood?

1417
01:54:19,333 --> 01:54:21,933
Don't cry

1418
01:54:22,586 --> 01:54:24,066
Don't cry dude

1419
01:54:29,170 --> 01:54:30,370
Leave me

1420
01:54:33,920 --> 01:54:35,040
Karthi

1421
01:54:55,005 --> 01:54:56,885
Is it the director?

1422
01:54:57,968 --> 01:54:59,488
You got hurt

1423
01:55:00,713 --> 01:55:02,033
Are you crying?

1424
01:55:03,966 --> 01:55:06,966
Don't get upset
This is just the beginning

1425
01:55:08,297 --> 01:55:10,017
Irony in cinema is...

1426
01:55:10,174 --> 01:55:14,374
To make the audience laugh,
the director has to cry

1427
01:55:14,630 --> 01:55:17,190
It's been 35 years
since I started crying

1428
01:55:19,427 --> 01:55:21,107
What are you looking at?

1429
01:55:21,264 --> 01:55:27,304
40 years before, I came to chennai
with a passion for cinema

1430
01:55:27,635 --> 01:55:30,795
5 years, I still hadn't got a start

1431
01:55:31,470 --> 01:55:35,710
Then 10 years I worked as an
assistant and experienced cinema

1432
01:55:36,261 --> 01:55:38,021
Everyone gets an opportunity

1433
01:55:38,175 --> 01:55:40,095
It's like an Angel

1434
01:55:40,260 --> 01:55:43,740
If you respect it,
It comes again and again

1435
01:55:43,933 --> 01:55:47,533
But if you disrespect it,
It will never come back

1436
01:55:49,305 --> 01:55:55,105
The new directors want to be
Sathyajitray on their debut film

1437
01:55:55,473 --> 01:55:59,993
They wont compromise
for a single thing

1438
01:56:06,058 --> 01:56:07,938
They create problems
on every small issue

1439
01:56:08,099 --> 01:56:09,699
Me too of same category

1440
01:56:09,849 --> 01:56:13,409
My producer wanted his cousins
to be casted in the movie

1441
01:56:13,642 --> 01:56:15,162
I said no and stood by

1442
01:56:15,264 --> 01:56:20,104
I said go and walked out stating
I will get 1000 more producers

1443
01:56:21,263 --> 01:56:24,343
But till now I haven't met...

1444
01:56:24,519 --> 01:56:26,959
...one among the thousands

1445
01:56:28,975 --> 01:56:31,935
I will just get hold of
people coming to my shop

1446
01:56:32,146 --> 01:56:34,746
And start telling them stories in
the name of Sivanesan and Kuruvamma

1447
01:56:34,898 --> 01:56:36,378
But they don't exist

1448
01:56:37,267 --> 01:56:39,747
That's my story Kuruvamma

1449
01:56:40,939 --> 01:56:45,179
If it would have got released in that period,
It would have been a massive hit

1450
01:56:46,394 --> 01:56:49,914
Should have been like
Balachander and Bharathiraja

1451
01:56:50,103 --> 01:56:52,103
Now I am 64 years old

1452
01:56:52,769 --> 01:56:55,009
Never Uttered the word
'Action and Cut'

1453
01:56:56,268 --> 01:56:59,148
Are you scared that
you'll end up like me

1454
01:56:59,564 --> 01:57:01,844
According to you
I might have lost,

1455
01:57:01,983 --> 01:57:04,863
But for me I am successful

1456
01:57:05,067 --> 01:57:07,947
Your success and failures,
shouldn't be determined by others

1457
01:57:08,151 --> 01:57:10,431
You should know from within

1458
01:57:10,605 --> 01:57:13,365
The clever pave their own way
Go on, do your work

1459
01:57:13,562 --> 01:57:15,002
I have to open the shop

1460
01:57:15,315 --> 01:57:17,955
Can't change a thing
by crying about it

1461
01:57:42,736 --> 01:57:44,576
What?

1462
01:57:45,488 --> 01:57:47,328
Hey I am telling you

1463
01:57:47,443 --> 01:57:48,843
Hey stop

1464
01:57:49,569 --> 01:57:51,369
Leave him

1465
01:57:54,236 --> 01:57:55,276
What do you want?

1466
01:57:56,030 --> 01:57:57,270
Thought about it

1467
01:57:59,446 --> 01:58:01,406
I have decided
to keep you as a hero

1468
01:58:05,904 --> 01:58:08,504
Nothing helps like pounding

1469
01:58:16,120 --> 01:58:17,680
Congratulations!

1470
01:58:20,409 --> 01:58:22,849
I've become a hero

1471
01:58:25,036 --> 01:58:27,996
We'll be unstoppable
after 5 films

1472
01:58:28,161 --> 01:58:30,601
They'll never leave us alone

1473
01:58:30,786 --> 01:58:33,146
They might come
back at us any day

1474
01:58:33,326 --> 01:58:35,246
What else can be done?

1475
01:58:37,453 --> 01:58:39,053
He has agreed
to direct the movie

1476
01:58:39,163 --> 01:58:41,083
Ask him to finish the shoot
smoothly and come back

1477
01:58:41,245 --> 01:58:42,605
Then we can look at it,
Once he is back

1478
01:58:42,703 --> 01:58:46,543
Yes, please ask him
to do that, just a movie

1479
01:58:46,749 --> 01:58:49,309
Ashok...

1480
01:58:54,871 --> 01:58:56,031
Just a minute

1481
01:59:00,576 --> 01:59:03,776
(A film monologue)

1482
01:59:32,834 --> 01:59:34,914
Super...Super

1483
01:59:38,917 --> 01:59:40,077
Was it okay?

1484
01:59:45,374 --> 01:59:46,854
I don't have a choice

1485
01:59:47,419 --> 01:59:49,499
You have to undergo
an acting training session

1486
01:59:50,165 --> 01:59:52,285
There is an acting
guru named 'Muthu'

1487
01:59:52,550 --> 01:59:55,270
You can go for
10 days acting classes

1488
01:59:55,797 --> 01:59:57,437
Then we will look into it

1489
01:59:57,631 --> 01:59:59,671
If Guru is coming,
let me also join the class

1490
01:59:59,797 --> 02:00:02,077
In Sethu's story definitely
I will have a role to play

1491
02:00:02,258 --> 02:00:04,658
Bro, I am the second hero as well

1492
02:00:09,129 --> 02:00:13,609
Whoever wishes to act, Can go
for the classes conducted by Muthu sir

1493
02:00:14,130 --> 02:00:16,130
Once he says okay,
let me start the shoot

1494
02:00:17,093 --> 02:00:19,893
- Only if he says okay
- He will,

1495
02:00:21,053 --> 02:00:22,933
If not we will ensure

1496
02:00:49,641 --> 02:00:51,441
When you act like a King

1497
02:00:51,600 --> 02:00:57,040
Every part of your body including
the hair and nails should feel like a King

1498
02:00:57,640 --> 02:00:59,800
Only when you act like a King

1499
02:01:00,181 --> 02:01:05,861
If it's a leper then...
Sir...please help me

1500
02:01:25,391 --> 02:01:26,671
You...?

1501
02:01:28,266 --> 02:01:31,066
He is our Guru,
don't hurt him

1502
02:01:31,230 --> 02:01:33,510
Only if he says okay
we go for the shoot

1503
02:01:33,648 --> 02:01:36,208
Sethu I've told you already
Don't hurt the guru

1504
02:01:36,397 --> 02:01:37,917
Come...come

1505
02:01:39,437 --> 02:01:40,997
Sir, are you okay?

1506
02:01:41,481 --> 02:01:44,881
Apologise sir!
It's by mistake

1507
02:01:48,101 --> 02:01:50,781
You may be a don in your place

1508
02:01:51,812 --> 02:01:54,692
You can be
whomever you are

1509
02:01:55,060 --> 02:01:57,020
Still you are my student

1510
02:01:59,063 --> 02:02:02,023
You will realise it
as we move ahead

1511
02:02:09,939 --> 02:02:11,459
Didn't understand?

1512
02:02:11,565 --> 02:02:14,405
Your classes starts from
tomorrow morning 5 a.m

1513
02:02:14,608 --> 02:02:16,208
Can't come at 5 AM

1514
02:02:18,024 --> 02:02:22,544
When I speak, I don't
want anyone to interrupt

1515
02:02:26,485 --> 02:02:30,645
Your classes starts from
tomorrow morning 4 a.m

1516
02:03:01,361 --> 02:03:04,521
For an actor the most important
language is body language

1517
02:03:04,738 --> 02:03:08,338
We will enact if we have to speak to someone
who doesn't understand our language

1518
02:03:08,574 --> 02:03:11,974
As an actor the language
we need to learn is gibberish

1519
02:03:12,203 --> 02:03:14,043
What's that, gibberish?

1520
02:03:19,408 --> 02:03:20,528
Can't understand

1521
02:03:20,620 --> 02:03:22,580
What is special in Madurai?

1522
02:03:22,910 --> 02:03:28,790
Most of the shops in Madurai is famous
for Parotta and Mutton Chukka food

1523
02:03:29,866 --> 02:03:32,826
Okay, convey the same in gibberish

1524
02:03:33,286 --> 02:03:36,726
In Madhurai Parotta...

1525
02:03:49,244 --> 02:03:51,284
Now everyone speaks in gibberish

1526
02:03:54,662 --> 02:03:56,822
This is very funny

1527
02:03:58,494 --> 02:03:59,854
Are you talking in Tamil?

1528
02:03:59,953 --> 02:04:01,833
Punishment, Ten times kill and laugh

1529
02:04:01,959 --> 02:04:02,919
What is it?

1530
02:04:02,998 --> 02:04:08,278
If you bathe in Kuttralum falls,
it will be very cool

1531
02:04:23,376 --> 02:04:25,976
Sethy, have you guys gone mad?

1532
02:04:30,546 --> 02:04:32,946
How long will this go?

1533
02:04:33,125 --> 02:04:35,125
From tomorrow we will
start the main course

1534
02:04:35,292 --> 02:04:36,932
It's just a warm up session

1535
02:04:37,459 --> 02:04:39,579
What did you say?
Warm up!

1536
02:04:40,082 --> 02:04:42,562
Are we looking like clowns?

1537
02:04:56,925 --> 02:04:58,365
Karuna - Compassion

1538
02:04:58,509 --> 02:05:00,069
Shringara - Love

1539
02:05:00,172 --> 02:05:01,732
Raudra - Anger

1540
02:05:01,841 --> 02:05:03,601
Veera-Courage

1541
02:05:03,715 --> 02:05:05,195

1542
02:05:05,297 --> 02:05:06,457

Shantha-Peace

1546
02:05:13,339 --> 02:05:15,059
Mercy...

1547
02:05:15,215 --> 02:05:17,335
How do you react
when someone gets injured?

1548
02:05:17,464 --> 02:05:19,184
Look at me and act

1549
02:05:22,593 --> 02:05:24,273
Why are you staring at me?

1550
02:05:25,339 --> 02:05:28,139
Why do you howl?
I'll hit you on your mouth

1551
02:05:28,341 --> 02:05:30,021
You are looking with lust,

1552
02:05:30,132 --> 02:05:31,692
Do I look like a woman?

1553
02:05:31,844 --> 02:05:36,164
Pull, pull out your tongue

1554
02:05:36,385 --> 02:05:37,665
You'll die

1555
02:05:37,758 --> 02:05:39,198
Do Shringharam

1556
02:05:39,757 --> 02:05:41,317
Why do you bite your lips?

1557
02:05:45,345 --> 02:05:47,345
Why do you cry?

1558
02:05:55,806 --> 02:05:58,886
Cry...feel and cry

1559
02:05:59,305 --> 02:06:02,265
Others should shed tears
looking at your cry

1560
02:06:02,476 --> 02:06:04,956
How would I make you understand?

1561
02:06:06,430 --> 02:06:08,630
Come on cry

1562
02:06:08,804 --> 02:06:10,444
Don't cry, master

1563
02:06:13,265 --> 02:06:15,545
Cry Sethu...cry

1564
02:06:25,598 --> 02:06:29,198
Love, is this how you
look at a girl with love?

1565
02:06:32,814 --> 02:06:35,694
Aren't you old enough?

1566
02:06:35,858 --> 02:06:38,618
Haven't you loved
a single girl in your life?

1567
02:06:40,309 --> 02:06:42,949
Didn't your heart
skip a beat ever?

1568
02:06:45,186 --> 02:06:47,826
Haven't you heard the melodies
of Ilayaraja in the air?

1569
02:06:48,017 --> 02:06:50,697
- I'm a Shankar Ganesh fan
- Very important

1570
02:06:51,394 --> 02:06:55,434
You won't, you will never
feel love in your life

1571
02:06:56,230 --> 02:06:57,510
Karthi...

1572
02:06:58,525 --> 02:07:00,005
I'm really sorry

1573
02:07:00,355 --> 02:07:03,915
You left me crying,

1574
02:07:04,106 --> 02:07:08,426
But you were drunk and dancing
I was so furious

1575
02:07:09,892 --> 02:07:12,652
So I just wanted
to get back at you

1576
02:07:12,815 --> 02:07:13,855
Tease...?

1577
02:07:15,105 --> 02:07:16,945
You ruined my career

1578
02:07:19,979 --> 02:07:20,899
Look at this

1579
02:07:21,028 --> 02:07:23,068
Have you ever
touched someone?

1580
02:07:23,654 --> 02:07:24,774
Not me

1581
02:07:25,568 --> 02:07:28,008
Will this movie be successful
with such a heroic face?

1582
02:07:29,238 --> 02:07:30,318
I swear it won't

1583
02:07:30,448 --> 02:07:32,448
Have you ever
touched any girl?

1584
02:07:32,569 --> 02:07:34,529
If something happens, I will...

1585
02:07:39,028 --> 02:07:43,108
Didn't you fool me with your love
That's why I set you up

1586
02:07:43,322 --> 02:07:44,522
Set up...?

1587
02:07:51,611 --> 02:07:55,011
An useless life
without a girl

1588
02:07:56,822 --> 02:07:58,862
I am talking to you,

1589
02:07:58,985 --> 02:08:00,985
Don't stand like a statue

1590
02:08:01,153 --> 02:08:03,913
Muthu sir,
don't scold him much

1591
02:08:04,071 --> 02:08:05,911
She can't bear it

1592
02:08:07,782 --> 02:08:09,302
Putting me in trouble...?

1593
02:08:14,491 --> 02:08:16,331
Don't Karthik, please

1594
02:08:16,452 --> 02:08:17,372
Sethu sir

1595
02:08:19,660 --> 02:08:21,540
She has been waiting so long

1596
02:08:21,662 --> 02:08:23,622
...and if everything
had happened in time

1597
02:08:23,745 --> 02:08:27,105
You wouldn't have to take this crap
from others is what Kayal feels

1598
02:08:27,283 --> 02:08:29,803
Could have got married

1599
02:08:30,284 --> 02:08:31,884
Even so, romance
would flood-

1600
02:08:31,992 --> 02:08:33,792
Karthik, please shut up

1601
02:08:35,746 --> 02:08:37,306
Karthik, I still love you

1602
02:08:40,413 --> 02:08:41,613
Try to understand

1603
02:08:43,374 --> 02:08:45,214
I just came to say it

1604
02:08:46,372 --> 02:08:48,292
I am not able to forget you

1605
02:08:53,953 --> 02:08:55,593
Hey Karthi,

1606
02:08:58,492 --> 02:09:01,172
She desired to
see me as an actor

1607
02:09:02,164 --> 02:09:04,204
Ask her to wait for sometime

1608
02:09:04,583 --> 02:09:07,263
Once the movie release,
immediately will marry her

1609
02:09:07,459 --> 02:09:08,419
Tell her

1610
02:09:13,831 --> 02:09:16,471
- Play that song now
- Shall I?

1611
02:09:27,083 --> 02:09:29,523
In my journey of 20 years

1612
02:09:29,708 --> 02:09:33,228
I have never come across
such a bunch of morons

1613
02:09:38,335 --> 02:09:41,495
But I have trained
them to my strength

1614
02:09:41,664 --> 02:09:44,184
So from this...

1615
02:09:44,338 --> 02:09:52,378
Oorni, Rasu, Senthil, Kasi,
Vettu Kumar you all stand aside

1616
02:09:54,630 --> 02:09:56,910
Sethu, come over here

1617
02:09:59,090 --> 02:10:01,450
We all passed the class

1618
02:10:02,505 --> 02:10:05,625
Sethu don't worry, we'll beg
and get you passed somehow

1619
02:10:05,837 --> 02:10:11,877
This whole lot here, even if they train
for eons to come, they can never act

1620
02:10:12,881 --> 02:10:15,361
Even the others could
stand in the atmosphere

1621
02:10:15,510 --> 02:10:16,790
But this one...?

1622
02:10:17,467 --> 02:10:20,667
Don't even think of placing
him in a corner of a frame

1623
02:10:20,884 --> 02:10:22,404
Total waste of time

1624
02:10:22,677 --> 02:10:23,677
Okay, sir

1625
02:10:24,424 --> 02:10:25,864
You sinner...!

1626
02:10:26,010 --> 02:10:28,490
This bugger over here

1627
02:10:29,007 --> 02:10:34,207
...is the worst actor
I have ever come across

1628
02:10:34,508 --> 02:10:36,988
But, he can act

1629
02:10:38,009 --> 02:10:42,769
Is there any scenes where
he has to cry or romance

1630
02:10:43,138 --> 02:10:44,418
Both are there

1631
02:10:45,557 --> 02:10:46,957
That's tough

1632
02:10:47,221 --> 02:10:52,101
If we could train and beat the shit out of
him, may be we can get some performance

1633
02:10:52,391 --> 02:10:56,271
But other than that
you can start the shooting

1634
02:11:01,475 --> 02:11:03,475
Producer sir, let's rock

1635
02:11:18,306 --> 02:11:19,986
Sir, first shot

1636
02:11:20,267 --> 02:11:22,107
Could you please clap,
so we can start?

1637
02:11:22,266 --> 02:11:26,546
I would be the only producer to invest,
knowing that it's a flop movie,

1638
02:11:26,764 --> 02:11:29,404
You want me to clap too?
Don't piss me off

1639
02:11:31,769 --> 02:11:33,409
Move away and stand

1640
02:11:36,353 --> 02:11:38,113
Pazhani sir, please come front

1641
02:11:39,852 --> 02:11:43,572
Please do the honor of
clapping for the first shot

1642
02:11:43,853 --> 02:11:45,693
- Should I?
- Com on, do it

1643
02:11:50,978 --> 02:11:52,818
'A.Kumar'

1644
02:11:53,020 --> 02:11:56,860
"No human in the world
is devoid of Desires"

1645
02:11:57,061 --> 02:12:00,541
"The same desire
that has split states"

1646
02:12:00,769 --> 02:12:07,529
"Only that is present,
Can be shown to the world"

1647
02:12:07,854 --> 02:12:11,774
"Doesn’t matter what
period you belong to"

1648
02:12:11,981 --> 02:12:14,861
"The craziness of love
will never wither off"

1649
02:12:15,020 --> 02:12:19,020
"The wonders that
the world has not seen Love"

1650
02:12:19,230 --> 02:12:23,110
"Will make you go in
search of, everyday!"

1651
02:12:30,196 --> 02:12:33,876
"Smiling like a weird slacker"

1652
02:12:34,109 --> 02:12:37,629
"Disrupting the harmony
of the system"

1653
02:12:37,860 --> 02:12:41,220
"Shouting like
the darkest animals"

1654
02:12:41,402 --> 02:12:45,842
"And roaming like a loafer"

1655
02:12:46,067 --> 02:12:47,627
28 times we have burnt him

1656
02:12:47,734 --> 02:12:50,054
You only did that
in your real life right?

1657
02:12:50,238 --> 02:12:52,478
Master teach him
crying exercise

1658
02:12:52,614 --> 02:12:56,814
"The wonders that
the world has not seen Love"

1659
02:12:57,026 --> 02:12:58,746
Haven't seen your
daughter for a while

1660
02:12:58,903 --> 02:13:00,943
Ask her to come over
to the shooting spot

1661
02:13:25,325 --> 02:13:27,045
Enough...enough

1662
02:13:27,156 --> 02:13:29,796
Master, teach him
crying exercise

1663
02:13:29,949 --> 02:13:31,709
It may rain
Let's go for a take

1664
02:13:31,827 --> 02:13:33,587
I told you to shoot
like the God Father movie

1665
02:13:33,701 --> 02:13:35,301
It's getting late
Let's go for the take

1666
02:13:35,411 --> 02:13:36,691
Lights off

1667
02:13:36,826 --> 02:13:38,266
What's the problem over there?

1668
02:13:38,368 --> 02:13:40,128
That Bluetooth head guy
creating problem

1669
02:13:40,288 --> 02:13:41,768
I can't do that

1670
02:13:41,913 --> 02:13:43,233
What do you want?

1671
02:13:45,079 --> 02:13:46,559
Lights on

1672
02:13:46,867 --> 02:13:48,787
After this dialogue
it's Sethu's entry

1673
02:13:48,910 --> 02:13:51,190
Where is Sethu?
Master, where is he?

1674
02:13:54,829 --> 02:13:59,269
Hey senseless goose, shot is ready
and everyone is looking for you

1675
02:13:59,493 --> 02:14:02,613
- I'll come right now
- Come quick, stupid

1676
02:14:03,001 --> 02:14:04,681
Guys take care of him

1677
02:14:04,833 --> 02:14:07,913
He is treating you
like a school student

1678
02:14:08,123 --> 02:14:09,363
Difficult to watch this

1679
02:14:10,292 --> 02:14:13,372
It is difficult to act as a gangster
than to really live like a gangster

1680
02:14:13,586 --> 02:14:17,026
"So what if you are the King,"

1681
02:14:17,207 --> 02:14:20,727
"You’ve to flex your muscles
to get things done"

1682
02:14:20,917 --> 02:14:28,237
"Taking a clown’s job will entail
making a fool of yourself"

1683
02:14:38,997 --> 02:14:43,237
Who kept the baby here?
You moron take it away

1684
02:14:43,460 --> 02:14:47,300
- Dude he is calling me a moron
- So what take it away now

1685
02:14:49,834 --> 02:14:52,714
What's all this second hero?

1686
02:14:54,129 --> 02:14:57,729
"Will make you go in
search of, everyday!"

1687
02:15:02,920 --> 02:15:05,080
He's hitting me for real

1688
02:15:05,254 --> 02:15:07,974
I'm supposed to
hit you in this scene

1689
02:15:08,132 --> 02:15:10,412
Till now no one has beat me

1690
02:15:15,003 --> 02:15:16,283
Pack up!

1691
02:15:24,885 --> 02:15:28,085
Master, what happened?

1692
02:15:28,964 --> 02:15:31,324
Slipped and fell down

1693
02:15:34,632 --> 02:15:36,312
How...how?

1694
02:15:37,173 --> 02:15:38,493
While taking bath

1695
02:15:42,720 --> 02:15:44,480
Did you all bath together?

1696
02:16:01,056 --> 02:16:04,576
In 3 months me
and Sethu will get married

1697
02:16:07,514 --> 02:16:10,194
Are you happy now?

1698
02:16:11,723 --> 02:16:14,723
If this movie flops,
you can make another

1699
02:16:16,553 --> 02:16:18,233
What about my life?

1700
02:16:20,638 --> 02:16:22,478
I loved you truly

1701
02:16:23,518 --> 02:16:26,478
You could have told me
when I proposed, right?

1702
02:16:34,059 --> 02:16:36,419
I'm not the filmy heroine type

1703
02:16:36,684 --> 02:16:39,404
Fighting everyone to marry my love

1704
02:16:41,227 --> 02:16:42,787
I will cry for few days...

1705
02:16:43,559 --> 02:16:47,679
...then will marry Sethu
and get on with my life

1706
02:16:49,185 --> 02:16:53,425
Like a breeze, you touched
my life and now you pass by

1707
02:16:55,562 --> 02:16:56,562
Go

1708
02:17:16,561 --> 02:17:18,441
Even I'm not the typical hero

1709
02:17:19,686 --> 02:17:22,166
...to fight Sethu
and take you away from him

1710
02:17:22,318 --> 02:17:24,078
I can't do all that

1711
02:17:24,444 --> 02:17:26,124
But I badly want to

1712
02:17:30,780 --> 02:17:34,180
We'll see, 3 more
months are there right

1713
02:17:56,651 --> 02:18:03,131
(Trailer on TV)

1714
02:18:14,743 --> 02:18:17,223
Whole Tamilnadu
should know my name

1715
02:18:22,452 --> 02:18:27,652
In the history of Madurai, Not just
Madurai in the history of whole India

1716
02:18:27,908 --> 02:18:31,788
For the first time a movie is getting
released in all the theatres in a city

1717
02:18:31,990 --> 02:18:33,950
Anywhere you turn,
you can only find his face

1718
02:18:34,115 --> 02:18:36,715
Entire city looks like
geared up for festival

1719
02:18:36,911 --> 02:18:39,271
Everywhere Sethu, Sethu

1720
02:18:39,743 --> 02:18:43,663
Why is the movie
named "A.Kumar"?

1721
02:18:43,868 --> 02:18:45,148
"Assault Kumar"

1722
02:18:45,536 --> 02:18:48,296
People call me
"Assault" Sethu right?

1723
02:18:48,448 --> 02:18:50,248
Since Assault is an English word

1724
02:18:50,370 --> 02:18:53,410
More tax has to be paid
That's why just the initial

1725
02:18:53,575 --> 02:18:56,575
We'll only release
Sharukh Khan movie

1726
02:18:56,742 --> 02:18:59,462
What can you do about it?

1727
02:19:00,294 --> 02:19:01,774
Leave the place

1728
02:19:07,083 --> 02:19:09,203
The movie is going to be
released tomorrow

1729
02:19:09,334 --> 02:19:11,214
For the next one year
only our film should run

1730
02:19:11,377 --> 02:19:14,697
My film should not lose,
If so it's a shame

1731
02:19:14,873 --> 02:19:16,873
We have given token to
every house in the city

1732
02:19:17,039 --> 02:19:20,119
Friday 3 p.m
and Sunday 6 p.m show okay?

1733
02:19:20,293 --> 02:19:22,613
2 shows? Friday have to
go to work

1734
02:19:22,791 --> 02:19:24,391
That's alright put
sick leave and come

1735
02:19:24,499 --> 02:19:27,539
We have arranged vehicles
to pick and drop everyone

1736
02:19:27,707 --> 02:19:29,827
Do come and enjoy the film

1737
02:19:29,957 --> 02:19:31,717
You've to come everyday

1738
02:19:31,877 --> 02:19:36,517
We are also gonna give biriyani
and alcohol for the film goers

1739
02:19:36,747 --> 02:19:38,867
You've got 150 tickets

1740
02:19:39,041 --> 02:19:41,321
Even one not turning up,
I'll kill you

1741
02:19:41,456 --> 02:19:48,016
Kollywood is in shock by looking
at the opening for a debut actor

1742
02:19:48,336 --> 02:19:52,016
We'll get to know the results
by tomorrow after the release

1743
02:20:04,880 --> 02:20:09,640
Is this the violent
action film that I asked for?

1744
02:20:13,216 --> 02:20:15,496
This is all I could manage with him

1745
02:20:19,630 --> 02:20:20,870
How is the movie?

1746
02:20:26,715 --> 02:20:28,275
Why are you crying, sir?

1747
02:20:37,300 --> 02:20:40,620
Dad, I'm not coming in
you go ahead

1748
02:20:40,848 --> 02:20:41,688
Why?

1749
02:20:41,885 --> 02:20:43,565
You go,
I'll watch from here

1750
02:20:44,351 --> 02:20:45,031
Okay

1751
02:20:45,678 --> 02:20:47,638
Come one by one

1752
02:20:47,762 --> 02:20:49,522
Get in...get in

1753
02:20:49,639 --> 02:20:51,239
Move...move

1754
02:21:52,768 --> 02:21:56,728
"In a land of blood and death,
called the grand Madurai...

1755
02:21:56,980 --> 02:22:01,980
among the ruthless killers was
born a man called 'A.Kumar'

1756
02:22:02,231 --> 02:22:05,351
In A.Kumar,
A stands for...

1757
02:22:09,060 --> 02:22:11,260
Azukuni Kumar
(Crybaby Kumar)

1758
02:22:11,437 --> 02:22:13,077
What he does is?

1759
02:22:13,231 --> 02:22:16,431
He cries for everything

1760
02:22:16,603 --> 02:22:18,843
...and tries to become a gangster

1761
02:22:19,311 --> 02:22:21,071
Who is that Azukuni Kumar?

1762
02:22:21,193 --> 02:22:23,273
Here comes our sir

1763
02:22:42,445 --> 02:22:48,125
If you make a gangster film with
him, it would be a laughing stock

1764
02:23:04,946 --> 02:23:08,066
You are acting serious
but everyone is laughing

1765
02:23:09,734 --> 02:23:14,574
In the next scene
I'll shoot a guy,

1766
02:23:14,950 --> 02:23:17,350
You see everyone
would be shocked

1767
02:23:33,574 --> 02:23:38,094
Cry man, cry out loud

1768
02:23:38,325 --> 02:23:40,245
He made me a fool

1769
02:23:42,037 --> 02:23:43,637
Roll camera

1770
02:23:44,493 --> 02:23:45,853
Do it

1771
02:23:46,282 --> 02:23:47,722
Hey, do it man

1772
02:23:53,247 --> 02:23:54,967
Listen to me carefully

1773
02:23:58,910 --> 02:24:00,390
Did you speak this dialogue?

1774
02:24:00,499 --> 02:24:02,339
What I spoke in that
scene was different

1775
02:24:02,455 --> 02:24:04,935
It's not even my voice
They have added it separately

1776
02:24:05,082 --> 02:24:08,122
Oh, you can add things
later to the movie is it?

1777
02:24:12,331 --> 02:24:14,331
Why are you crying, sir?

1778
02:24:15,246 --> 02:24:17,966
Awesome, how did you?

1779
02:24:18,125 --> 02:24:19,685
Awesome, man

1780
02:24:22,126 --> 02:24:29,126
Everyone in the audience is
gonna enjoy every minute of it

1781
02:24:31,125 --> 02:24:33,885
First he cut the call,
Now it's switched off

1782
02:24:42,167 --> 02:24:44,727
The song was different when we
shot, now it is something else

1783
02:24:50,007 --> 02:24:53,647
I have never seen people
laughing so much for a song

1784
02:24:55,587 --> 02:24:57,427
It seems like a magic

1785
02:24:57,548 --> 02:25:00,988
It is our fault, not knowing
what could be made in cinema

1786
02:25:02,628 --> 02:25:06,948
Light it and cry
Light it...and cry

1787
02:25:08,712 --> 02:25:10,432
Now light it and cry

1788
02:25:15,758 --> 02:25:18,398
Hit your head and cry

1789
02:25:19,051 --> 02:25:20,891
Jump crying from there

1790
02:25:43,389 --> 02:25:44,789
Come, let's go

1791
02:25:47,095 --> 02:25:48,895
He ditched us

1792
02:25:49,219 --> 02:25:52,779
Eating my food, under my roof,
with my story, look what he did

1793
02:25:53,387 --> 02:25:55,427
That's why they never
to trust the educated

1794
02:25:57,140 --> 02:25:59,700
- Great job
- Superb

1795
02:26:01,680 --> 02:26:03,600
- Mom
- Movie is very good

1796
02:26:07,215 --> 02:26:08,215
Tell me, sir

1797
02:26:08,306 --> 02:26:10,426
Acted like a buffoon
feeling ashamed

1798
02:26:10,555 --> 02:26:12,355
- Tell me, boss
- Sethu...

1799
02:26:12,513 --> 02:26:14,393
Awesome, buddy

1800
02:26:14,512 --> 02:26:17,712
You made Sethu a joker,
the comedy king of the decade

1801
02:26:19,470 --> 02:26:21,710
- Thank you, sir
- I hope your next movie with me

1802
02:26:23,809 --> 02:26:28,129
Hey I'm flying to Singapore tonight
You guys too be safe, don't get caught

1803
02:26:28,349 --> 02:26:31,069
If we get caught,
that's it

1804
02:26:32,602 --> 02:26:35,282
This movie is breaking genre
and trends set here

1805
02:26:35,435 --> 02:26:37,755
A comedy gangster flick
"Azhuguni Kumar" (Crybaby Kumar)

1806
02:26:37,894 --> 02:26:39,374
How did you get the idea?

1807
02:26:39,517 --> 02:26:42,677
People are scared of these
murderers and killers

1808
02:26:42,894 --> 02:26:45,894
With a story of such
a violent murderer...

1809
02:26:46,059 --> 02:26:48,179
I wanted to make
everyone laugh

1810
02:26:48,350 --> 02:26:52,750
In fact most of these rowdies
will look like a joker up close

1811
02:26:52,980 --> 02:26:54,340
Just thought of showing that

1812
02:26:54,477 --> 02:26:58,357
How did you find the lead,
looked really funny on screen?

1813
02:27:00,067 --> 02:27:02,467
We were looking for
a guy who looks comical

1814
02:27:02,609 --> 02:27:05,249
An apt face
for Azukuni Kumar,

1815
02:27:05,399 --> 02:27:08,359
Of the 1000 faces I saw,
he fitted perfectly for the title

1816
02:27:11,852 --> 02:27:15,892
The gang in chennai is in the lookout,
but they all went hiding

1817
02:27:17,811 --> 02:27:21,171
Our biggest assets is
the fear people have seeing us

1818
02:27:23,776 --> 02:27:27,296
Have lost that all in one day

1819
02:27:28,903 --> 02:27:31,543
Find Karthik and kill him

1820
02:27:33,443 --> 02:27:35,643
Kill him with my hands

1821
02:27:52,696 --> 02:27:56,256
There is no one in this house
Looks like locked for while

1822
02:27:56,442 --> 02:27:57,842
Where is Oorni?

1823
02:27:57,943 --> 02:28:00,543
It's been 2 weeks
since sir went abroad

1824
02:28:00,693 --> 02:28:02,293
You guys are staging
a drama here

1825
02:28:03,486 --> 02:28:05,206
He is not there

1826
02:28:19,114 --> 02:28:20,674
10 lakh if Sethu should come

1827
02:28:20,825 --> 02:28:22,625
It is fine but you finish
the deal, don't need Sethu

1828
02:28:22,742 --> 02:28:26,542
If he comes, everyone would burst into
laughter and no one would take it serious

1829
02:28:46,745 --> 02:28:49,065
- He is coming
- Is he the one?

1830
02:28:56,156 --> 02:28:59,236
- Where is Karthi
- I don't know brother

1831
02:28:59,875 --> 02:29:01,715
They have thrashed him
at the Temple

1832
02:29:02,042 --> 02:29:05,962
He's is safe for now, has requested
and extended his stay in the hospital

1833
02:29:06,665 --> 02:29:08,705
Your parents have
reached Bombay safely

1834
02:29:08,834 --> 02:29:10,394
Speak to them

1835
02:29:10,543 --> 02:29:12,543
Why are we running and hiding?

1836
02:29:13,788 --> 02:29:15,188
What did I do wrong?

1837
02:29:15,291 --> 02:29:17,011
What didn't you?

1838
02:29:17,122 --> 02:29:20,202
He started beating people cause someone
laughed at him in a school drama

1839
02:29:20,417 --> 02:29:23,497
Now everyone is laughing at him
Because of you

1840
02:29:23,707 --> 02:29:25,347
I didn't pull him into this

1841
02:29:25,497 --> 02:29:28,217
He forced me to do it

1842
02:29:29,454 --> 02:29:32,054
It's me who should chase
and him for this state

1843
02:29:32,667 --> 02:29:34,107
We've got to do something

1844
02:29:34,876 --> 02:29:36,236
What can we do?

1845
02:29:37,623 --> 02:29:41,103
We caught a reporter
once and took him to...

1846
02:29:41,291 --> 02:29:43,011
- Where was that?
- Sugarcane field

1847
02:29:43,334 --> 02:29:48,654
Took him there and
planned to burn him alive

1848
02:29:48,914 --> 02:29:51,434
If you had shown this
2 months back...

1849
02:29:51,632 --> 02:29:53,592
...there would have been
no need to even make that movie

1850
02:29:53,712 --> 02:29:57,232
Just had a thought
about the evidences

1851
02:29:58,630 --> 02:29:59,830
What is the plan?

1852
02:29:59,924 --> 02:30:02,684
I spoke to ACP Raman
This proof is enough

1853
02:30:02,840 --> 02:30:06,760
We need to get this
to Dindigul police tomorrow

1854
02:30:06,963 --> 02:30:10,523
Dindigul? Why don't we go
to Madurai only? It's risky

1855
02:30:10,712 --> 02:30:14,672
Sethu is not a gang lord for
the police to come and collect the proof

1856
02:30:14,885 --> 02:30:16,365
We have to go for our needs

1857
02:30:16,462 --> 02:30:19,222
Don't worry they are
looking for you in Chennai

1858
02:30:19,380 --> 02:30:21,820
That's why you are
hiding here near Madurai

1859
02:30:21,967 --> 02:30:25,847
It is better to hide beneath
the enemy than across him

1860
02:30:26,089 --> 02:30:28,849
But we can't stay hidden forever

1861
02:30:29,008 --> 02:30:31,408
Its been a week since my kid
was born, haven't seen him yet

1862
02:30:31,590 --> 02:30:33,950
Don't worry just another 10 days

1863
02:30:34,132 --> 02:30:36,172
Will Sethu forget everything
in 10 days?

1864
02:30:36,298 --> 02:30:37,738
No he'll be forever gone

1865
02:30:38,088 --> 02:30:41,248
They have burned the reporter alive,
will the police leave him?

1866
02:30:41,636 --> 02:30:45,756
ACP said if the proof is good,
he can move and get the order

1867
02:30:45,974 --> 02:30:47,774
- What order?
- What else?

1868
02:30:47,933 --> 02:30:49,533
For encountering Sethu

1869
02:30:50,514 --> 02:30:51,754
They will kill him?

1870
02:30:53,637 --> 02:30:54,917
Let him die

1871
02:30:59,050 --> 02:31:02,650
Every show they are
talking about Sethu

1872
02:31:02,889 --> 02:31:03,729
Yeah

1873
02:31:07,134 --> 02:31:12,054
This A.Kumar has become
the undeniable king of comedy

1874
02:31:21,680 --> 02:31:25,080
Have you gone mad?
Why are acting crazy?

1875
02:31:25,847 --> 02:31:28,407
Yes, they have made me crazy

1876
02:31:28,762 --> 02:31:33,202
The whole world is making fun of me
and you both are having your laughs

1877
02:31:33,476 --> 02:31:38,436
Its not like that Sethu,
all big stars are praising you

1878
02:31:39,770 --> 02:31:41,970
Have you ever had the courage
to talk in front of me?

1879
02:31:43,812 --> 02:31:45,532
Where did you
get the guts to talk?

1880
02:31:46,684 --> 02:31:48,844
You have lost the fear
for me, right?

1881
02:31:48,974 --> 02:31:53,694
That's why all this,
do I look funny to you?

1882
02:31:53,939 --> 02:31:56,179
Stop this, hitting women

1883
02:31:56,479 --> 02:31:59,959
If you are stuck here in this house,
they will make you a joker for real

1884
02:32:00,188 --> 02:32:01,988
We have got close to Karthik,

1885
02:32:02,104 --> 02:32:03,384
We'll find him 2 days

1886
02:32:03,478 --> 02:32:04,798
What happened now?

1887
02:32:04,939 --> 02:32:07,739
We'll murder some
and get our name back

1888
02:32:08,727 --> 02:32:11,767
Ponram's dad expired it seems,
just got the news

1889
02:32:11,937 --> 02:32:13,577
The funeral is in Dindigul house

1890
02:32:15,813 --> 02:32:19,413
The duet song in the A.Kumar film
is the talk of the town

1891
02:32:19,610 --> 02:32:22,610
More than 5 million viewers
have seen this song on YouTube

1892
02:32:22,778 --> 02:32:28,658
The trend setting song and the comedy
performance of the hero becomes-

1893
02:32:28,945 --> 02:32:30,185
Sethu...?

1894
02:32:30,278 --> 02:32:31,638
Let's enjoy the song

1895
02:32:32,736 --> 02:32:36,176
Sethu...hey Sethu

1896
02:32:37,358 --> 02:32:39,398
Fetch some water for me

1897
02:32:47,316 --> 02:32:48,796
Would they kill everyone?

1898
02:32:49,530 --> 02:32:53,330
I don't know about all
but Sethu for sure

1899
02:32:53,610 --> 02:32:55,730
Is that really needed?

1900
02:32:56,025 --> 02:32:57,065
Isn't it wrong?

1901
02:32:57,150 --> 02:32:58,990
You prefer to die
in their hands?

1902
02:32:59,777 --> 02:33:02,257
Its a game of cat and mouse

1903
02:33:03,488 --> 02:33:05,328
We have to play cat,
like they taught us

1904
02:33:05,985 --> 02:33:08,345
Everything is right for survival

1905
02:33:09,400 --> 02:33:10,960
What is that for?

1906
02:33:11,617 --> 02:33:13,377
Just for safety, uncle gave it

1907
02:33:13,492 --> 02:33:15,012
We don't need that

1908
02:34:02,247 --> 02:34:03,967
Once he ruled
the whole Dindigul

1909
02:34:04,082 --> 02:34:06,562
What did he rule?

1910
02:34:06,705 --> 02:34:08,825
Does this look
like a king's funeral?

1911
02:34:08,998 --> 02:34:12,118
Not even a single soul that lurked
in his shadows turned to his funeral

1912
02:34:12,416 --> 02:34:17,136
We mistake all
the fear for respect

1913
02:34:17,414 --> 02:34:20,134
There are a lot who are
happy that he's gone

1914
02:34:21,582 --> 02:34:23,862
A coffee with less sugar

1915
02:34:28,165 --> 02:34:31,525
He is the hero
of the movie A.Kumar

1916
02:34:40,911 --> 02:34:43,551
You were the actor
in AKumar movie right?

1917
02:34:43,711 --> 02:34:45,471
Yes, Sethu was the hero in that

1918
02:34:45,625 --> 02:34:47,265
Heard the movie is doing well

1919
02:34:47,375 --> 02:34:49,055
Have to watch it
after all this is over

1920
02:34:49,166 --> 02:34:53,726
Watched the movie, it was so awesome
You have done a great job

1921
02:34:53,962 --> 02:34:56,722
The whole movie
was a laugh riot

1922
02:34:57,339 --> 02:35:00,179
Your dance
and fight was excellent

1923
02:35:00,340 --> 02:35:02,220
I told you right, he's that hero

1924
02:35:15,466 --> 02:35:16,906
Stop the car

1925
02:35:19,172 --> 02:35:20,332
Reverse it

1926
02:36:11,052 --> 02:36:14,932
I think this police
business is not needed

1927
02:36:15,220 --> 02:36:17,420
Everything that happened
was in our favor, isn't it?

1928
02:36:17,552 --> 02:36:19,512
Don't keep repeating the same

1929
02:36:19,678 --> 02:36:23,678
If you feel like helping me,
just keep quiet

1930
02:36:25,306 --> 02:36:28,226
We won't get caught
don't worry

1931
02:36:28,388 --> 02:36:30,468
They'll never leave us in peace

1932
02:38:07,818 --> 02:38:09,098
Just a minute

1933
02:38:11,157 --> 02:38:13,077
- Who's that?
- Sounder's wife

1934
02:38:16,616 --> 02:38:18,936
We saw your movie
it was good

1935
02:38:20,202 --> 02:38:22,842
We haven't gone out
anywhere since his death

1936
02:38:23,071 --> 02:38:28,151
But last week your people
forced us to go watch it in theaters

1937
02:38:28,864 --> 02:38:30,824
I laughed after a long time

1938
02:38:31,616 --> 02:38:34,216
She has become your fan
watching the movie

1939
02:38:34,368 --> 02:38:36,648
She wanted to watch it again,
took her again the next day

1940
02:38:39,409 --> 02:38:41,569
You wanted to say
something right, say it

1941
02:38:41,704 --> 02:38:43,584
Tell him, he has to leave

1942
02:38:43,703 --> 02:38:47,223
Uncle you had danced well
and fights were nice

1943
02:38:47,449 --> 02:38:49,769
Crybaby Kumar was superb

1944
02:38:49,911 --> 02:38:52,471
Are you done,
shall we go?

1945
02:38:57,490 --> 02:38:59,330
- Doesn't she know?
- No one knows

1946
02:38:59,456 --> 02:39:01,776
Sekar shot Sounder
and we shot him back

1947
02:39:01,913 --> 02:39:03,073
That is all

1948
02:39:03,787 --> 02:39:07,427
She wants to
shake hands with you

1949
02:39:07,957 --> 02:39:10,797
You asked right, go on

1950
02:41:00,306 --> 02:41:05,146
(Gibberish)

1951
02:41:48,139 --> 02:41:49,219
Go away

1952
02:41:57,563 --> 02:41:58,483
Get lost

1953
02:42:00,896 --> 02:42:02,136
Get lost I say

1954
02:42:41,446 --> 02:42:42,446
Come, Oorni

1955
02:42:56,648 --> 02:42:59,888
Do you have Director
Maniratnam's number?

1956
02:43:19,450 --> 02:43:21,370
'Today'

1957
02:43:31,781 --> 02:43:34,101
Sir, the target is in position
shall we move?

1958
02:43:36,784 --> 02:43:37,784
Let's move

1959
02:43:54,202 --> 02:43:55,122
What?

1960
02:43:55,367 --> 02:43:58,047
Karthik has sent you a gift

1961
02:44:10,624 --> 02:44:13,264
Sir, its over
he's dead

1962
02:44:13,416 --> 02:44:15,976
Jigarthanda means cold-heart

1963
02:44:16,121 --> 02:44:17,841
It's not a usual script

1964
02:44:17,997 --> 02:44:21,117
It's against the social violence
and about world peace

1965
02:44:21,292 --> 02:44:24,732
Just think about it again,
In this subject-

1966
02:44:24,914 --> 02:44:28,794
Hello, I understand,
your story is good

1967
02:44:29,500 --> 02:44:33,300
Maybe after 2 years
we'll see about it

1968
02:44:44,872 --> 02:44:48,552
We'll start the shoot in 2 months
You are the hero

1969
02:44:48,956 --> 02:44:50,276
Are you commanding me?

1970
02:44:50,377 --> 02:44:52,457
Who do you think you are?

1971
02:44:52,586 --> 02:44:55,826
I'll make sure you don't
make films anymore

1972
02:44:56,040 --> 02:44:57,720
Getup, Idiot

1973
02:44:57,835 --> 02:44:58,995
Hey guards

1974
02:44:59,340 --> 02:45:00,220
Get up

1975
02:45:00,298 --> 02:45:01,298
Hey guards

1976
02:45:20,965 --> 02:45:22,445
What's all this? Ro...?

1977
02:45:23,672 --> 02:45:25,072
Rowdyism?

1978
02:45:37,630 --> 02:45:38,590
Cut

1979
02:45:40,674 --> 02:45:43,434
Okay?
Is the shot ok?

1980
02:45:43,761 --> 02:45:47,521
How was my performance?
Is it okay, sir?

1981
02:45:47,763 --> 02:45:49,523
Is the shot okay?

1982
02:45:49,679 --> 02:45:52,319
Sir, I've performed well, isn't it?

1983
02:45:52,882 --> 02:45:53,962
Sir, tell me

1984
02:45:54,054 --> 02:45:55,814
- Muthu
- Coming

1985
02:45:56,634 --> 02:45:59,394
What's this?
Is this what I asked?

1986
02:45:59,554 --> 02:46:01,714
- I'll correct it
- Make it fast

1987
02:46:01,846 --> 02:46:03,726
He can't act
even if it was real

1988
02:46:03,845 --> 02:46:05,645
This is not fair

1989
02:46:08,718 --> 02:46:13,078
Look, I am not seeking your
permission to act in my film

1990
02:46:15,345 --> 02:46:17,665
I'm telling you
to act in the film

1991
02:46:18,843 --> 02:46:19,923
Okay?

1992
02:46:20,012 --> 02:46:23,372
Okay, I'll do it but the next
will be Mani Ratnam's

1993
02:46:23,553 --> 02:46:25,193
Uncle...Uncle?

1994
02:46:25,721 --> 02:46:27,721
- Uncle?
- What?

1995
02:46:27,844 --> 02:46:29,044
Don't disturb him

1996
02:46:29,144 --> 02:46:33,144
No thanks, but call me Dad

1997
02:46:36,351 --> 02:46:38,951
Feeling romantic...?

1998
02:46:39,185 --> 02:46:43,385
Tell me dear,
Yeah I'm with him

1999
02:46:45,513 --> 02:46:47,153
He will agree

2000
02:46:47,726 --> 02:46:49,846
He has

2001
02:46:50,060 --> 02:46:51,420
I'll call you back

2002
02:46:56,144 --> 02:46:58,424
My wife is your fan

2003
02:46:59,314 --> 02:47:02,474
She wants you to act
without all these tash and beard

2004
02:47:03,062 --> 02:47:04,462
You'll look good

2005
02:47:05,269 --> 02:47:09,829
Of course, this script right?
Jigarthanda

2006
02:47:10,063 --> 02:47:13,823
About the social injustice
brought by violence

2007
02:47:14,021 --> 02:47:18,461
...and a hero who fights
back the system

2008
02:47:20,066 --> 02:47:21,986
A good social message

2009
02:47:24,400 --> 02:47:25,680
A good script

2010
02:47:26,857 --> 02:47:28,537
Nothing helps like pounding

2011
02:47:29,651 --> 02:47:33,251
Ok, let's go for one more
Double up

2012
02:47:36,900 --> 02:47:38,540
Looks good on you

2013
02:47:40,069 --> 02:47:41,269
Camera

2014
02:47:43,900 --> 02:47:45,020
Action
