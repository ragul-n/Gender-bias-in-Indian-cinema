''Laiio, give me the suitcase. Come.''

176
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:44,502
This fatso has no brains!

177
00:17:53,866 --> 00:17:56,368
''l spoke to you like a gentleman
initially, didn't l?''

178
00:17:56,433 --> 00:18:01,337
This doesn't mean that you
will say whatever you want!

179
00:18:02,866 --> 00:18:04,500
What are you doing?

180
00:18:04,566 --> 00:18:07,101
Hey! Catch her! Don't leave her!

181
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:08,867
l won't spare him!
- Come!

182
00:18:09,566 --> 00:18:11,567
She thinks that she
is my girlfriend.

183
00:18:11,633 --> 00:18:13,935
Can a girl like her
be my girlfriend?

184
00:18:14,133 --> 00:18:17,236
Blind fatso! Get your
eyesight checked!

185
00:18:17,299 --> 00:18:19,835
Stop! Where are you running away?

186
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:28,535
These lower class people!

187
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:34,437
l was mad that l brought
you here. Forgive me.

188
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,468
Will you climb the pipe?

189
00:18:40,633 --> 00:18:42,835
Girls are not allowed in my house.

190
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,835
But if you climbed the
pipe for 3 floors..

191
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:45,967
..then everything will be fine.

192
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,835
l will push you from below.

193
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:54,834
What is the day today?

194
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,569
Thursday.
- Friday night.

195
00:19:02,966 --> 00:19:04,233
Come.

196
00:19:08,233 --> 00:19:09,834
''Come, meet me. Come, meet me.''

197
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,234
''Come, meet me. Come, meet me.''

198
00:19:11,299 --> 00:19:12,834
''Come, meet me. Come, meet me.''

199
00:19:14,233 --> 00:19:16,835

''Come, meet me. Come, meet me.''

204
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,434
''Come, meet me. Come, meet me.''

205
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,835
''Come, meet me.''

206
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,572
''The eyes that come.
The eyes that go.''

207
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:39,238
''These eyes are waiting
for you, beloved.''

208
00:19:39,366 --> 00:19:44,838
''The eyes that come.
The eyes that go.''

209
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:50,272
''These eyes are waiting
for you, beloved.''

210
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:51,834
''Come, meet me. Come, meet me.''

211
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,101
''Come, meet me. Come, meet me.''

212
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:55,868
''Come, meet me.''

213
00:19:55,933 --> 00:19:57,334
''Come, meet me. Come, meet me.''

214
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,834
''Come, meet me. Come, meet me.''

215
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:01,369
''Come, meet me.''

216
00:20:01,433 --> 00:20:07,038
''The eyes that come.
The eyes that go.''

217
00:20:07,099 --> 00:20:12,572
''These eyes are waiting
for you, beloved.''

218
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:32,237
''Since the time l fell in
Iove with my beloved.''

219
00:20:32,299 --> 00:20:37,838
l have lost my sleep.

220
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:43,572
''Since the time l fell in
Iove with my beloved.''

221
00:20:43,633 --> 00:20:48,938
l have lost my sleep.

222
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,902
''l search for my beloved.
l love my beloved.''

223
00:20:51,966 --> 00:20:54,568
l wait to unite with my beloved.

224
00:20:54,633 --> 00:20:57,302
''l search for my beloved.
l love my beloved.''

225
00:20:57,366 --> 00:21:00,035
l wait to unite with my beloved.

226
00:21:00,099 --> 00:21:05,839
l wait for him.

227
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:08,369
l wait for him.

228
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:14,172
''The eyes that are lonely.
The eyes that are crying.''

229
00:21:14,233 --> 00:21:16,935
''These eyes bear the
pain of separation.''

230
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,836
Don't worry. l have prayed for you.

231
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:20,934
Now everything will be fine.

232
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,137
''The eyes that come.
The eyes that go.''

233
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:30,838
''These eyes are waiting
for you, beloved.''

234
00:21:32,233 --> 00:21:33,834
2 buses have drowned.

235
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:36,002
100 people are feared
to have drowned.

236
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:39,836
Good! If this continues then the
population too will reduce.

237
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:47,069
You don't worry. It is the matter
ofjust a few hours.

238
00:21:47,133 --> 00:21:49,134
Your Dheerai will come back.

239
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:51,233
Okay?

240
00:21:51,299 --> 00:21:53,268
Beloved calls me mad.

241
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:58,571
Since the time l leR my emotions.

242
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:04,338
Beloved calls me mad.

243
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:09,838
Since the time l leR my emotions.

244
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:12,569
''l leR with the desire
to meet my beloved.''

245
00:22:12,633 --> 00:22:15,369
My youth melted like a candle.

246
00:22:15,433 --> 00:22:18,269
''l leR with the desire
to meet my beloved.''

247
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:21,102
My youth melted like a candle.

248
00:22:21,166 --> 00:22:26,204
lt melted.

249
00:22:26,266 --> 00:22:29,135
lt melted.

250
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:35,139
''The eyes that are awake. The
eyes that are sleeping.''

251
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:40,572
These eyes cry in your memories.

252
00:22:40,633 --> 00:22:46,338
''The eyes that come.
The eyes that go.''

253
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:51,838
''These eyes are waiting
for you, beloved.''

254
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:57,372
''The eyes that come.
The eyes that go.''

255
00:22:57,433 --> 00:23:03,005
''These eyes are waiting
for you, beloved.''

256
00:23:04,266 --> 00:23:09,337
Fine. As soon as Dheerai returns..

257
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:13,437
..tell him to call on 232Q1625.

258
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:15,835
625. Yes.

259
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:20,904
Will you remember the name?
Ankush. Thank you.

260
00:23:27,366 --> 00:23:29,835
l think he will surely come today.

261
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,935
Your Dheerai. Don't worry.

262
00:23:32,966 --> 00:23:39,005
l have to go for work.
You.. come here.

263
00:23:39,833 --> 00:23:41,434
Bhavana aunty.
- Yes.

264
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,335
She is with me.
- Okay.

265
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,268
Can she sit here?

266
00:23:45,333 --> 00:23:49,170
''Ankush, what are you saying?
It's your own shop.''

267
00:23:49,299 --> 00:23:51,835
''Come, dear. Come. Sit.''

268
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,835
Did you have fun at night?

269
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:58,235
You too! You iust talk rubbish!

270
00:23:58,299 --> 00:24:00,869
ls that so? Then why
didn't you come home?

271
00:24:00,933 --> 00:24:01,967
You won't understand.

272
00:24:02,033 --> 00:24:06,437
''Yes, l understand everything.
She is good! The girl is good!''

273
00:24:08,166 --> 00:24:10,301
Humar sir. How are you?
- Hello.

274
00:24:10,366 --> 00:24:11,567
l have found 2 more witnesses.

275
00:24:12,333 --> 00:24:14,568
Sharma-ii.
- Tell me. - The form.

276
00:25:50,099 --> 00:25:53,436
Everybody told me. Everybody.

277
00:25:55,033 --> 00:25:58,870
Don't trust him. Don't trust him.

278
00:26:03,266 --> 00:26:05,568
He will leave you on the street.

279
00:26:06,433 --> 00:26:08,568
That is exactly what he has done!

280
00:26:14,166 --> 00:26:21,306
Everybody said this. Stay away
from Dheeraj. Stay away.

281
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:25,468
And l..

282
00:26:30,833 --> 00:26:32,868
l am such a fool!

283
00:26:32,933 --> 00:26:34,834
''Fine, Megha.''

284
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:37,869
''l don't know!
- Megha, people are staring.''

285
00:26:39,966 --> 00:26:42,535
Look.. we will go away from here.

286
00:26:44,333 --> 00:26:46,568
''Look, crying is futile.''

287
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:50,134
He must have got stuck somewhere.

288
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,501
Maybe he will come tomorrow.

289
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:54,368
He won't come.

290
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:14,571
What's the matter? Doesn't
seem to be a love a_air.

291
00:27:17,966 --> 00:27:20,401
You are lucky.

292
00:27:21,133 --> 00:27:23,068
You will have great fun.

293
00:27:23,133 --> 00:27:26,536
This is not so. We iust
have to spend the night.

294
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:29,002
And l don't have money.

295
00:27:30,633 --> 00:27:33,068
You have fun. That is my payment.

296
00:27:34,233 --> 00:27:40,305
And if there is any other
payment.. aRer you.

297
00:27:40,833 --> 00:27:43,569
Buddy.. this is not so.

298
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:48,901
What are you saying?

299
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:51,301
lt is not necessary.

300
00:27:52,966 --> 00:27:54,834
Thank you.

301
00:28:01,966 --> 00:28:03,434
Come.

302
00:28:31,233 --> 00:28:32,567
''Thank you, buddy.''

303
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,169
The bed is old. But it is strong.

304
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,001
Bye.

305
00:28:53,833 --> 00:28:55,234
There is no need to worry.

306
00:29:08,933 --> 00:29:14,505
Ankush.. you are doing so
much for me. - Its nothing.

307
00:29:16,833 --> 00:29:20,836
Don't think.. that
l don't trust you.

308
00:29:23,566 --> 00:29:30,839
Maybe.. maybe.. maybe
l am too scared. And..

309
00:29:31,033 --> 00:29:33,869
Say it clearly. What's the matter?

310
00:29:33,933 --> 00:29:36,201
''Look, l.. l don't even know you.''

311
00:29:36,966 --> 00:29:38,534
l don't know whether you..

312
00:29:41,833 --> 00:29:47,405
l mean.. l am a girl.
- And l am a guy. So?

313
00:29:50,066 --> 00:29:51,834
You are right.

314
00:29:52,933 --> 00:29:54,834
lf a guy had been in your place..

315
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,935
..then maybe l wouldn't
have helped him.

316
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:59,901
Not maybe. l wouldn't
have helped him.

317
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:07,838
Actually l haven't stayed
in girls' company for long.

318
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:12,837
And.. l have no chance
with a girl like you.

319
00:30:13,433 --> 00:30:14,867
You are a traditional girl.

320
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:19,402
So l like your company.

321
00:30:20,099 --> 00:30:23,503
And l feel proud that
l am helping you.

322
00:30:25,933 --> 00:30:32,906
That's the only thing. Understood?
l don't love you.

323
00:30:35,966 --> 00:30:39,135
And.. there is no
question about sex.

324
00:30:41,099 --> 00:30:44,136
Already you are so tense.
Don't be more tense.

325
00:30:44,933 --> 00:30:46,501
Have you gone mad?

326
00:30:47,433 --> 00:30:48,967
''Thank you, Ankush.''

327
00:30:49,833 --> 00:30:51,834
lf you hadn't been there..
l don't know where..

328
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:53,968
''..l would have been, what
l would have done.''

329
00:30:54,033 --> 00:30:55,534
Fine.

330
00:30:55,633 --> 00:30:58,569
''Really Ankush, l want to thank
you from the depth of my heart.''

331
00:30:58,633 --> 00:30:59,834
Fine.

332
00:31:04,266 --> 00:31:07,035
l will arrange for something to eat.

333
00:31:10,566 --> 00:31:14,002
Close the door. l will
be back in a ji_y.

334
00:31:28,366 --> 00:31:30,367
2 plate of 'Bhurii'.

335
00:31:55,933 --> 00:31:57,167
Ankush!

336
00:32:03,099 --> 00:32:04,334
Who is it?

337
00:32:45,133 --> 00:32:48,336
Who is it?
- Who is it?

338
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:51,569
Who is it?
- Open the door!

339
00:32:51,633 --> 00:32:53,568
Why are you shouting!
- Open the door!

340
00:32:57,233 --> 00:33:00,336
Sekri!

341
00:33:02,166 --> 00:33:04,234
What is going on?
- He..

342
00:33:05,033 --> 00:33:06,834
Where is Megha?

343
00:33:10,833 --> 00:33:12,334
Where is she?

344
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,835
A client had come.

345
00:33:17,833 --> 00:33:20,502
Why should l spoil my
business for your girl?

346
00:33:20,566 --> 00:33:24,102
You are such a scoundrel!
Couldn't you have waited!

347
00:33:24,966 --> 00:33:26,167
Where is she?

348
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:30,835
''lf she is not here,
then look upstairs.''

349
00:34:18,833 --> 00:34:19,934
You came on the terrace?

350
00:34:24,233 --> 00:34:27,102
Did anybody say something?
Did somebody tease you?

351
00:34:32,099 --> 00:34:34,035
That Sekri too is a scoundrel.

352
00:34:39,233 --> 00:34:40,834
What happened?

353
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:49,573
She told me to sit on the veranda.
l felt scared there.

354
00:34:50,833 --> 00:34:52,568
Everybody was staring at me.

355
00:34:56,099 --> 00:34:58,135
He will do anything for money!

356
00:35:00,366 --> 00:35:04,837
l apologize for what happened.
You just don't cry.

357
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,835
l threw the food too.

358
00:35:12,199 --> 00:35:13,568
You must be hungry.

359
00:35:16,833 --> 00:35:17,900
Come.

360
00:35:27,033 --> 00:35:30,035
Will you come home tonight?
- l don't know.

361
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:33,836
lt has been 2 nights. Her boyFriend
has still not come.

362
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:37,470
Why doesn't she go back?
- She says she can't go back.

363
00:35:37,966 --> 00:35:39,834
So you have taken
her responsibility?

364
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:44,037
She is an alone girl. It is
Delhi. Where will she go?

365
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,568
l am worried about this.

366
00:35:49,166 --> 00:35:50,233
Tea.

367
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,135
''Chhotu, listen. Do one thing.''

368
00:35:55,833 --> 00:36:00,837
That girl over there.. give
this to her. There.

369
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,268
Go. There.

370
00:36:08,033 --> 00:36:11,236
Tea. Ankush brother has sent it.

371
00:36:20,033 --> 00:36:24,837
What's your name?
- Chhotu. What's your name?

372
00:36:25,833 --> 00:36:26,934
Megha.

373
00:36:30,566 --> 00:36:34,836
Why don't you take her
to some old age home?

374
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:38,236
Have you gone mad? Will
l keep this girl there?

375
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:39,968
This is not what l meant.

376
00:36:40,033 --> 00:36:42,568
The 'Navieevan' old age
home in the vicinity..

377
00:36:42,633 --> 00:36:45,369
..there people are needed
to serve aged people.

378
00:36:45,433 --> 00:36:46,834
Especially girls.

379
00:36:47,866 --> 00:36:52,437
Will she stay there?
- Is there any other option?

380
00:36:55,633 --> 00:36:57,468
Fine. What will l have to do?

381
00:37:01,099 --> 00:37:02,935
Won't you have some tea or coffee?

382
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,567
''No, thank you.''

383
00:37:05,099 --> 00:37:07,836
l am glad that young
people like you..

384
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:10,569
..are so compassionate
about senior citizens.

385
00:37:11,633 --> 00:37:13,835
l am glad that you are ioining us.

386
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:17,435
Thank you.
- Welcome.

387
00:37:19,533 --> 00:37:21,101
Why does he need money?

388
00:37:22,566 --> 00:37:25,835
Security deposit for the hostel.

389
00:37:27,833 --> 00:37:31,836
This is the limit! Pay money
for social service too!

390
00:37:32,199 --> 00:37:33,534
How much is he asking?

391
00:37:34,099 --> 00:37:38,571
''10,OOO rupees. Deposit for 1 month.''

392
00:37:39,433 --> 00:37:40,500
''10,OOO rupees.''

393
00:37:42,866 --> 00:37:47,503
lt is possible.
- It is not possible. Come.

394
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,937
''l will get it.
- No, Ankush. Let's go.''

395
00:37:55,333 --> 00:37:58,836
''l can get 10,OOO rupees.
l will get it by evening.''

396
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:00,835
You will be in the hostel
room in the night.

397
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:03,402
l can't take so much money as loan.

398
00:38:03,466 --> 00:38:05,935
You are not taking loan. l am
the one who is taking loan.

399
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,968
''Look, l can't put you in this mess.''

400
00:38:10,833 --> 00:38:12,568
There is no other option.

401
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:16,836
''Even if you work somewhere, you
will get the money aRer a month.''

402
00:38:17,199 --> 00:38:18,834
What will you do till then?

403
00:38:20,633 --> 00:38:21,934
Listen to me.

404
00:38:22,366 --> 00:38:25,869
Go and tell them that you will
deposit the money till evening. Fine?

405
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:32,567
From where will you get the money?

406
00:38:36,166 --> 00:38:37,333
Zulfi!

407
00:38:39,933 --> 00:38:43,069
Stop! Listen to me!

408
00:38:48,333 --> 00:38:49,467
Stop!

409
00:38:50,233 --> 00:38:51,968
Oh Allah!

410
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:56,369
Hey! Stop! Listen to me!

411
00:38:58,599 --> 00:39:00,435
You make me run early
in the morning.

412
00:39:00,966 --> 00:39:04,903
''Look, what happened that night..
- Forget that!''

413
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:09,469
l have some work from you.
- What?

414
00:39:12,833 --> 00:39:15,835
l need money. On loan.

415
00:39:16,033 --> 00:39:17,300
How much?

416
00:39:18,233 --> 00:39:22,170
l have thought of an idea. Money
will double in a month.

417
00:39:22,633 --> 00:39:25,035
''Only 10,OOO rupees.''

418
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:30,169
Do you think.. l have so much money?

419
00:39:30,966 --> 00:39:33,968
You don't have it. But your mother.

420
00:39:34,033 --> 00:39:36,268
She has so much money.

421
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:40,570
Fine. So l will tell mother
that Ankush needs money.

422
00:39:40,633 --> 00:39:44,970
Fool! Think of some other pretext!

423
00:39:46,066 --> 00:39:48,067
l will return your money
within a month.

424
00:39:48,166 --> 00:39:51,202
''On top of that, l will give
you 2000 rupees extra.''

425
00:39:51,333 --> 00:39:52,867
So that you can have fun.

426
00:39:55,866 --> 00:39:58,835
No. What if you lose your money?

427
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:02,169
lt will be my loss. But
there won't be any loss.

428
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:03,834
lt is a sure shot game.

429
00:40:06,033 --> 00:40:10,370
''And as it is, no matter what, you
will surely benefit from it.''

430
00:40:10,433 --> 00:40:12,935
Hey! Don't talk rubbish!

431
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:15,835
There is no deal in friendship!

432
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:18,967
And what happened that night..

433
00:40:19,033 --> 00:40:21,568
..you thought that your friend
has turned back on his words.

434
00:40:21,633 --> 00:40:23,901
You know how l am
in front of mother.

435
00:40:24,033 --> 00:40:27,002
And can your friend ever betray you?

436
00:40:29,099 --> 00:40:31,535
Ours is a di_erent case.

437
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,035
Tell me. When do you want the money?

438
00:40:39,133 --> 00:40:40,334
Right now.

439
00:41:41,233 --> 00:41:44,836
lt is cold outside. And
you catch cold quickly.

440
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:46,468
Father Pinto was saying so.

441
00:41:46,533 --> 00:41:49,535
This is not so. l got sick mice.

442
00:41:50,933 --> 00:41:52,901
''You want to go for
a walk, don't you?''

443
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:58,871
Wow! You look very handsome!
Take this.

444
00:42:00,833 --> 00:42:01,900
Come.

445
00:42:03,366 --> 00:42:04,567
Come.

446
00:42:06,833 --> 00:42:09,101
''Look, isn't it cold?''

447
00:42:19,633 --> 00:42:22,168
''Hello, mister. Who are you?''

448
00:42:23,099 --> 00:42:24,334
Ankush.

449
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,835
''Well, Ankush. You
will have to leave.''

450
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:30,169
Megha or any other attendant's
visitors are not allowed here.

451
00:42:30,233 --> 00:42:31,267
Do you understand?

452
00:42:31,333 --> 00:42:34,569
Megha? Who is Megha?

453
00:42:34,633 --> 00:42:36,534
The one whom you waved iust now.

454
00:42:37,633 --> 00:42:42,571
l waved uncle. l have come to
meet him. Is that allowed?

455
00:42:42,833 --> 00:42:45,569
ls Mr. Gokhale your uncle?
- Yes.

456
00:42:45,633 --> 00:42:47,001
What work do you have from him?

457
00:42:47,633 --> 00:42:49,067
l don't have any work.

458
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:52,469
''Whenever l get the time,
l come to chat with him.''

459
00:42:55,133 --> 00:42:57,068
l don't have parents.

460
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:00,568
lt feels good.

461
00:43:01,566 --> 00:43:06,437
''That's good! That's very good!
Bless you, my son.''

462
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:07,567
Thank you.

463
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:10,401
''Hello, uncle. How are you?''

464
00:43:15,166 --> 00:43:17,034
''Look, l have come again.''

465
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:20,969
So how are you?

466
00:43:28,466 --> 00:43:29,834
Fine.

467
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:33,201
So you have settled here properly.

468
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:38,403
Yes. As far as we could.

469
00:43:39,266 --> 00:43:43,036
Missing your family?
- Yes.

470
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,101
Do you miss your family?

471
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,002
No. You don't want
to go home now too?

472
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:58,969
lt is better to drown myself
rather than go back.

473
00:44:01,833 --> 00:44:02,900
Am l right?

474
00:44:04,966 --> 00:44:06,267
You tell me.

475
00:44:06,833 --> 00:44:09,135
Went away with my money!

476
00:44:09,266 --> 00:44:13,837
Move! Bansi! Bansi!
- Aunty!

477
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:15,835
Where is that Ankush?

478
00:44:17,833 --> 00:44:19,568
Why don't you say something?
- There!

479
00:44:20,833 --> 00:44:24,136
Where did he go? l won't spare him!

480
00:44:24,199 --> 00:44:25,834
Mother.. mother.. try to understand!

481
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:27,234
''He won't be there, mother!''

482
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:30,569
There he is! There he is!
- Mother! Mother!

483
00:44:30,633 --> 00:44:32,067
Come!
- Mother!

484
00:44:33,633 --> 00:44:36,836
Aunty? You and here?

485
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:38,501
The moon has come
out during daytime!

486
00:44:38,566 --> 00:44:40,200
Hang on! So..

487
00:44:40,266 --> 00:44:44,069
Fool! You threatened my
son and took the money!

488
00:44:44,133 --> 00:44:45,167
Give me the money! Give it to me!

489
00:44:45,233 --> 00:44:47,068
''Aunty, not now. The
clients are with me.''

490
00:44:47,133 --> 00:44:49,335
Let them also know what
a scoundrel you are!

491
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:52,503
With my money you are having
fun with your girlfriend.

492
00:44:52,566 --> 00:44:55,101
She is not my girlfriend. l had
explained to you last night!

493
00:44:55,166 --> 00:44:58,836
l see! So you have started a new
business of selling girls!

494
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:01,102
Look! Look! He has started a new
business of selling girls!

495
00:45:01,166 --> 00:45:03,101
Don't listen to her.

496
00:45:03,166 --> 00:45:05,401
''You see, since the time
her husband died..''

497
00:45:05,466 --> 00:45:06,834
..she has received a big shock.

498
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:08,301
You call me mad! You call me mad!

499
00:45:08,366 --> 00:45:11,902
Who dares to call you mad!
You are hale and hearty!

500
00:45:11,966 --> 00:45:13,834
All the doctors are lying.

501
00:45:15,166 --> 00:45:18,402
l like you. Everybody likes you.

502
00:45:18,466 --> 00:45:20,067
Fool! Deceiver!

503
00:45:20,133 --> 00:45:23,536
Leave him! l am not
going to spare you!

504
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:27,570
What will you do? How will
you hit me? Show me.

505
00:45:28,833 --> 00:45:30,201
Mad woman!

506
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,569
This woman is mad! This
is everyday drama!

507
00:45:36,933 --> 00:45:39,368
Don't listen to her. She is mad.

508
00:45:47,366 --> 00:45:51,236
l will throw the money on her
face! What does she think?

509
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:53,568
Your mother is crazy for money!

510
00:45:53,633 --> 00:45:57,837
l am scared. She might reach the
girl's hostel for the money.

511
00:45:57,900 --> 00:45:59,968
Then you stop her.
- Okay.

512
00:46:00,033 --> 00:46:01,934
She will immediately
stop if l stop her!

513
00:46:02,166 --> 00:46:03,534
Witch!

514
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:06,836
What will happen by abusing
or being tense?

515
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:10,436
''Do something. For 10,OOO rupees
aunty will not wait for a month.''

516
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:13,569
''10,OOO rupees is a heRy sum.
It is an unprofitable deal.''

517
00:46:13,633 --> 00:46:15,568
Who asked for your opinion?

518
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:18,102
l am saying that it is
an unprofitable deal.

519
00:46:18,166 --> 00:46:21,002
''You can do anything with
this 10,OOO rupees.''

520
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,103
l will make you a eunuch.
Then talk about loss.

521
00:46:25,166 --> 00:46:27,835
''Ankush! Ankush, leave him!''

522
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:29,034

Fine! Now calm down! Take

And here is your interest.
Now count the whole day.

And you meet me in the lane.

605

Your idea! Of that diary! l am

612
00:53:12,633 --> 00:53:13,834
''And l have made 10,OOO rupees.''

613
00:53:16,966 --> 00:53:19,401
''You are such a fool, Ankush.
- Why?''

614
00:53:20,133 --> 00:53:24,103
Don't you think that only a
fool can do all this for me?

615
00:53:25,833 --> 00:53:29,269
Don't your friends tease you?
That this girl is fooling you?

616

Do you know? Today l was passing
the marriage registrar.

619
00:53:37,133 --> 00:53:41,537
And l thought that l was
Ieading a dog's life.

620
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:46,070
Witness. No respect. No guarantee.

621
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:51,037
l was finished. Then
l found a new job.

622
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:56,004
Of a bank agent. It has
respect and money too.

623
00:53:56,233 --> 00:53:59,836
And how did this happen?
Because of whom?

624
00:54:00,433 --> 00:54:01,500
ls that so?

625
00:54:03,966 --> 00:54:05,033
What is this?

626
00:54:07,233 --> 00:54:11,170
Please don't open it now.
- But what is it?

627
00:54:12,099 --> 00:54:13,835
Don't mind. But l am
seeing you only..

628
00:54:13,900 --> 00:54:16,435
..in 3 dresses since so many days.

629
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:21,938
''Black, white and yellow. So..
- Ankush.''

630
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:27,868
Can you come out with me?

631
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,002
We will go to watch a movie.
We will have dinner.

632
00:54:31,166 --> 00:54:33,401
We will party for repaying the loan.

633
00:54:36,033 --> 00:54:40,904
''Yes, l can come. l will
make some excuse.''

634
00:54:42,833 --> 00:54:44,901
Thank you. Bye.

635
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:55,306
Beloved..

636
00:54:56,033 --> 00:54:59,836
Take this.
- Why are you spending so much?

637
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:03,570
Those days are gone. l am earning
nicely. You just eat.

638
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:07,069
Do know what my bank manager
told me? - What?

639
00:55:07,133 --> 00:55:10,402
''He said Ankush Ramdev, your
record is the best.''

640
00:55:10,466 --> 00:55:12,968
You should try for the
area supervisor.

641
00:55:13,033 --> 00:55:14,200
Then what will you do?

642
00:55:14,266 --> 00:55:17,569
What will l do? l am not that
kind of a person. - What?

643
00:55:18,966 --> 00:55:20,500
Like a supervisor.

644
00:55:22,266 --> 00:55:24,835
You look like a high-class
man in pant and shirt.

645
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:26,835
What harm is there in asking?

646
00:55:28,633 --> 00:55:31,035
You are calling me high-class.
You are mad.

647
00:55:32,266 --> 00:55:34,835
Why didn't the bank manager give
this offer to anybody else?

648
00:55:35,233 --> 00:55:37,535
''There are many like you,
aren't there?''

649
00:55:37,900 --> 00:55:40,569
There are. But..
- Because you deserve this.

650
00:55:41,833 --> 00:55:46,571
He knows that you are not amongst
those who will stop.

651
00:55:47,033 --> 00:55:51,103
Agent.. area supervisor.. boss.

652
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:53,001
You can be anybody!

653
00:55:54,166 --> 00:55:55,834
What are you saying?

654
00:55:57,333 --> 00:55:59,835
My friends will laugh
if they hear this.

655
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:01,501
Ankush you can be anybody!

656
00:56:01,566 --> 00:56:04,502
l don't need to ask anybody
else about you.

657
00:56:11,833 --> 00:56:15,102
lt is so cold. It feels good.

658
00:56:15,233 --> 00:56:17,568
ln Nainital too the atmosphere
is like this.

659
00:56:17,633 --> 00:56:18,834
ls that so?

660
00:56:18,966 --> 00:56:23,170
''Thank you, Ankush. l will
never forget this evening.''

661
00:56:24,166 --> 00:56:25,433
There is still another thing.

662
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:29,070
What? You mean to say there
is another surprise?

663
00:56:29,133 --> 00:56:30,367
Something like that.

664
00:56:32,133 --> 00:56:34,969
l want to make a call.
- Where?

665
00:56:35,833 --> 00:56:37,901
Your home. In Nainital.

666
00:56:40,833 --> 00:56:45,837
Megha. - Ankush.. how can
you even think of this?

667
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,569
You know the situation.
- Yes.

668
00:56:48,833 --> 00:56:51,302
What yes? What will l tell them?

669
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:57,237
''No, this is not possible.
l will not do it.''

670
00:56:57,300 --> 00:57:00,836
''Megha, you will do it. You
will do it right now.''

671
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,868
''Ankush, they won't even talk to me.''

672
00:57:04,099 --> 00:57:08,571
''They must be mad with rage.
No, l won't do it.''

673
00:57:08,833 --> 00:57:10,568
''Megha, they are your parents.''

674
00:57:11,933 --> 00:57:14,502
Have you ever thought what they
must have gone through?

675
00:57:14,566 --> 00:57:16,501
You are missing since
the past 2 months.

676
00:57:17,133 --> 00:57:19,835
''They must be worried, not angry.''

677
00:57:20,099 --> 00:57:22,836
And l am not saying that you
call them and tell them..

678
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:25,102
..where you are and
what you are doing.

679
00:57:26,033 --> 00:57:29,870
l am iust saying that they will
feel better aRer hearing your voice.

680
00:57:29,933 --> 00:57:34,837
Tell them that you are fine.
You are alive. - How can l..

681
00:57:36,233 --> 00:57:38,969
''Megha, what l am saying..
that is right. Okay?''

682
00:58:36,900 --> 00:58:39,502
''Thank you, Ankush!
Thank you so much.''

683
00:58:40,133 --> 00:58:42,468
''Ankush, you have done
so much for me.''

684
00:58:42,533 --> 00:58:45,135
But.. this is your greatest
favour on me.

685
00:58:45,266 --> 00:58:47,568
l will always remain indebted
to you for this.

686
00:59:15,833 --> 00:59:16,900
Let's go.

687
00:59:23,433 --> 00:59:26,035
l met you.

688
00:59:28,033 --> 00:59:31,269
Desires aroused.

689
00:59:33,166 --> 00:59:41,574
Many dreams.. were weaved.

690
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:50,139
''l don't know where
my heart got lost.''

691
00:59:52,900 --> 00:59:57,371
Gradually..

692
01:00:00,300 --> 01:00:05,838
Gradually..

693
01:00:31,233 --> 01:00:33,468
l met you.

694
01:00:35,533 --> 01:00:38,402
Desires aroused.

695
01:00:40,366 --> 01:00:47,506
Many dreams.. were weaved.

696
01:00:49,966 --> 01:00:54,537
''l don't know where
my heart got lost.''

697
01:00:56,033 --> 01:01:02,873
Gradually..

698
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:07,838
Gradually..

699
01:01:07,900 --> 01:01:13,905
Gradually..

700
01:01:14,066 --> 01:01:19,204
Gradually..

701
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:55,141
''l wish l cold stop these
passing moments.''

702
01:01:55,866 --> 01:02:04,074
''Forgetting the whole world,
l love only you.''

703
01:02:04,966 --> 01:02:09,003
l love only you.

704
01:02:09,199 --> 01:02:11,835
For the rest of my life.

705

l will live here.

706
01:02:18,500 --> 01:02:25,874
l don't want to go away from you.

707
01:02:27,266 --> 01:02:34,373
''l don't know where
my heart got lost.''

708
01:02:34,433 --> 01:02:41,106
Gradually..

709
01:02:41,199 --> 01:02:45,938
Gradually..

710
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:50,537
Gradually..

711
01:02:50,599 --> 01:02:55,104
Gradually..

712
01:03:13,066 --> 01:03:14,267
We will meet tomorrow.

713
01:03:15,566 --> 01:03:16,833
Tomorrow?

714
01:03:24,833 --> 01:03:25,900
Bye.

715
01:03:41,099 --> 01:03:42,401
l am sorry.

716
01:03:47,566 --> 01:03:48,833
Don't mind.

717
01:03:52,833 --> 01:03:57,470
Very good! Excellent!

718
01:03:58,066 --> 01:03:59,133
Come here!

719
01:04:00,033 --> 01:04:03,469
Pack your luggage and go
away from here. Come on!

720
01:04:03,533 --> 01:04:04,567
Father!

721
01:04:04,633 --> 01:04:07,902
Don't say anything!
You have said enough!

722
01:04:07,966 --> 01:04:11,569
l want to serve the residents
because they have no one else.

723
01:04:13,633 --> 01:04:16,569
You have taken advantage of the
resident and the institute!

724
01:04:16,633 --> 01:04:19,268
For yourself! For this loafer!

725
01:04:20,133 --> 01:04:24,170
''Well, this institute is
not a pick up point.''

726
01:04:24,500 --> 01:04:26,935
Just get your luggage and get out!

727
01:04:34,633 --> 01:04:35,834
Sir!

728
01:04:35,900 --> 01:04:37,835
Get off the premises right now!

729
01:04:38,166 --> 01:04:42,003
We are not Father like you.
We are ordinary people.

730
01:04:42,066 --> 01:04:43,133
We do make mistakes.

731
01:04:43,199 --> 01:04:45,969
l don't want to talk to
you! Get out of here!

732
01:04:46,033 --> 01:04:47,968
l only had brought
Megha to stay here.

733
01:04:48,033 --> 01:04:50,835
l had lied that l don't know her.

734
01:04:50,900 --> 01:04:53,836
Then we would meet under the
pretext of uncle and aunty!

735
01:04:57,099 --> 01:05:00,837
Why l did all this? What is
my relation with Megha?

736
01:05:01,099 --> 01:05:02,434
l can't answer these questions.

737
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:03,567
Because l myself don't know.

738
01:05:04,933 --> 01:05:07,568
But l know that nothing is
wrong in this relation.

739
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:10,869
l don't think that l have
committed a crime.

740
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,135
That's why l am standing
in front of you.

741
01:05:14,199 --> 01:05:16,101
l can look into your eyes and talk.

742
01:05:20,933 --> 01:05:23,035
''This girl has faced many
hardships, Father.''

743
01:05:23,900 --> 01:05:26,302
l don't want her to face
any more hardships.

744
01:05:29,900 --> 01:05:31,468
''Yes, l love her.''

745
01:05:31,900 --> 01:05:37,071
That's why l request you..
don't banish her from here.

746
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:40,835
Give me 2 months.

747
01:05:42,333 --> 01:05:45,836
ARer 2 months l myself will
come and take her from here.

748
01:05:46,433 --> 01:05:47,534
RespectFully.

749
01:05:49,366 --> 01:05:52,068
''l have got a good iob offer, Father.''

750
01:05:52,133 --> 01:05:53,968
As an area supervisor in the bank.

751
01:05:54,033 --> 01:05:56,535
''Within 2 months, l will earn
enough to buy a house.''

752
01:05:57,233 --> 01:06:01,337
Even l will work. Even l will earn.

753
01:06:03,099 --> 01:06:05,435
''lt will be done, Father.
Everything will be fine.''

754
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:08,369
''Life will be set. Just
2 months, Father.''

755
01:06:10,433 --> 01:06:11,467

And you!

Thank you.

765
01:06:56,900 --> 01:06:59,102
''Thank you, Father!''

766

''Aunty! Aunty, you are great!''

773

''That girl.. Megha, you had

''Yes, she is my girlfriend!
You are great, aunty!''

775
01:07:34,966 --> 01:07:38,869
l am coming to kiss you! Wait!

Why are you shouting? You fool!

01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:52,568
You have made this a habit!

You don't even allow
us to sleep! Fool!

782
01:07:55,133 --> 01:07:57,835
You have harassed us so much!

783
01:08:28,333 --> 01:08:30,835
''Dealer, what are you doing here?''

784
01:08:30,899 --> 01:08:34,203
Just like that. l was waiting
for you. Where were you?

785
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:36,835
Why? What work do you have with me?

786
01:08:36,899 --> 01:08:39,068
Bansi has brought somebody.
- So?

787
01:08:39,166 --> 01:08:40,834
He is waiting outside.

788
01:08:41,233 --> 01:08:43,301
He has come to meet me?
- Yes.

789
01:09:00,066 --> 01:09:01,834
Ankush?
- Yes.

790
01:09:01,899 --> 01:09:03,835
He is Dheerai sir. From Nainital.

791
01:09:03,899 --> 01:09:06,335
He came to my shop asking
the whereabouts.

792
01:09:10,100 --> 01:09:12,168
Did you call me in Nainital?

793
01:09:12,233 --> 01:09:16,437
You had leR a number. Of this
STD booth. Did you call me?

794
01:09:16,833 --> 01:09:18,234
Tell me what the matter is.

795
01:09:18,300 --> 01:09:19,567
That is what l want to know.

796
01:09:19,633 --> 01:09:21,568
Maybe there was something. That's
why you did all this.

797
01:09:21,633 --> 01:09:23,868
You had called a few months ago.

798
01:09:23,933 --> 01:09:28,103
My mother had answered the
call. You asked for me.

799
01:09:28,166 --> 01:09:29,433
Did you remember something?

800
01:09:29,899 --> 01:09:32,569
''When l don't know you, then
why will l call you?''

801
01:09:32,633 --> 01:09:33,967
l didn't call you.

802
01:09:34,033 --> 01:09:35,968
You had leR your name.

803
01:09:37,266 --> 01:09:38,867
Bansi.
- Yes.

804
01:09:38,933 --> 01:09:41,235
How many people call from
your STD booth everyday?

805
01:09:42,866 --> 01:09:43,933
Thousands.

806
01:09:44,833 --> 01:09:46,834
Nowadays my shop is
running smoothly.

807
01:09:47,833 --> 01:09:50,202
Some other Ankush must
have called you.

808
01:09:50,266 --> 01:09:51,967
l am not the only Ankush in Delhi.

809
01:09:52,033 --> 01:09:53,834
Go and shout on the street. Ankush.

810
01:09:53,899 --> 01:09:54,967
3-4 will come running!

811
01:09:55,033 --> 01:09:56,901
You had said that you
know who had called.

812
01:09:56,966 --> 01:10:00,436
Yes. That's why. That's
why l brought you here.

813
01:10:01,100 --> 01:10:02,568
l thought it must be him.

814
01:10:02,633 --> 01:10:03,834
You thought so?

815
01:10:10,899 --> 01:10:13,435
''So Ankush, you didn't call me?
- No.''

816
01:10:14,233 --> 01:10:17,436
Actually the thing is that l am
searching for a girl. - Okay.

817
01:10:17,500 --> 01:10:18,567
Her name is Megha.

818
01:10:18,833 --> 01:10:24,371
She was in Delhi when you.. l mean
when that person had called.

819
01:10:24,833 --> 01:10:27,569
Do you know any girl
whose name is Megha?

820
01:10:27,966 --> 01:10:31,336
l don't know any Megha.
- At least try.

821
01:10:31,466 --> 01:10:33,301
Megha Joshi from Nainital.

822
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,369
Look at this snap. You might
remember something.

823
01:10:38,433 --> 01:10:41,903
''5 112 feet height, fair complexion,
Iong hair.''

824
01:10:43,933 --> 01:10:45,567
l meet so many people everyday.

825
01:10:45,833 --> 01:10:47,568
l won't remember a single
person's face.

826
01:10:52,333 --> 01:10:55,936
l understand your problem.
But l don't know this girl.

827
01:11:00,866 --> 01:11:01,933
Fine.

828
01:11:24,833 --> 01:11:26,167
''Bansi, do you know that l have..''

829
01:11:26,500 --> 01:11:28,568
..mo orders for today night?

830
01:11:34,833 --> 01:11:36,267
ls your shop closed today?

831
01:11:37,166 --> 01:11:38,834
Should l not drink the tea?

832
01:11:38,899 --> 01:11:40,268
So drink your tea!

833
01:11:40,333 --> 01:11:41,834
''Let it at least come, or
do you want me to put..''

834
01:11:41,899 --> 01:11:42,967
..my mouth in the fire?

835
01:11:43,833 --> 01:11:44,900
lf he keeps on glaring like
this then one day..

836
01:11:44,966 --> 01:11:46,567
..we will see him sitting
at the florist.

837
01:11:46,633 --> 01:11:47,834
''What do you say, guru?
- Leave me alone!''

838
01:11:49,966 --> 01:11:51,033
Where is Ankush?

839
01:11:51,100 --> 01:11:53,235
Don't know; since morning he
has vanished from the house.

840
01:11:54,833 --> 01:11:57,435
He must have gone there!
To his Meera's house.

841
01:11:57,500 --> 01:11:58,567
He must be enioying there.

842
01:12:03,833 --> 01:12:05,534
Hey you iust keep quiet!

843
01:12:05,833 --> 01:12:07,334
But why are you getting angry?

844
01:12:14,833 --> 01:12:19,237
''Ankush, what is all this that
l am hearing? Is it the truth?''

845
01:12:19,833 --> 01:12:21,467
Now don't give me a lecture.

846
01:12:21,533 --> 01:12:23,301
Whatever has happened has happened!
Leave it! - Is it?

847
01:12:24,199 --> 01:12:25,834
lf you can say it; then
why don't you say it?

848
01:12:25,899 --> 01:12:27,968
You have gone and handed over
the boyFriend to that girl.

849
01:12:29,100 --> 01:12:35,573
Do you have the guts?
No! Drink your tea.

850
01:12:58,566 --> 01:13:03,170
What if he comes?
- Who? - Dheeraj.

851
01:13:11,033 --> 01:13:12,834
Did you have a talk with
the bank manager?

852
01:13:15,833 --> 01:13:17,267
About being the area supervisor.

853
01:13:23,633 --> 01:13:27,036
''Megha, you have not
answered my question.''

854
01:13:27,100 --> 01:13:28,568
l have a lot of work here to do.

855
01:13:28,833 --> 01:13:30,935
l don't have the time
for foolish talk.

856
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:35,970
''Even then, if he comes and
stands in front of you.''

857
01:13:36,233 --> 01:13:38,034
Then what will you do?

858
01:13:39,366 --> 01:13:42,302
''He has not come for so many days,
what will he come now?''

859
01:13:46,899 --> 01:13:50,837
''You used to love him, isn't it?
- Yes.''

860
01:13:51,833 --> 01:13:52,900
And now?

861
01:13:52,966 --> 01:13:54,834
''Now that person, that
time, that place..''

862
01:13:54,899 --> 01:13:56,935
..everything is over for me.

863
01:14:00,033 --> 01:14:02,001
''Ankush, that was another world..''

864
01:14:02,166 --> 01:14:04,501
..which l do not want to remember.

865
01:14:09,166 --> 01:14:12,836
Ask me! Whatever you want to

''Because aRer today, we will
never talk about it. Ask me!''

868
01:14:24,899 --> 01:14:26,167
Okay!

869
01:15:06,833 --> 01:15:08,568

by our boss# 

870
01:15:08,633 --> 01:15:09,834
'Thank you sir!'

871
01:15:10,899 --> 01:15:12,935
So you want to become
the area supervisor?

872

''Sir, l have many ideas with me.''

873
01:15:16,133 --> 01:15:20,570
''Good! You are capable,
and hard working, but..''

874
01:15:20,633 --> 01:15:22,568
''Mr. Ramdev, there is a problem!''

875
01:15:22,633 --> 01:15:24,334
You do not know English.

''Sir, l am from Delhi! And there
people talk only in Hindi.''

877
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,569
There no one talks in English.

878
01:15:34,233 --> 01:15:36,935
lf l have brought so many accounts..

879
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:38,868
..it is not because of English.

880
01:15:38,966 --> 01:15:42,569
lt is because l am also one of them.

881
01:15:42,833 --> 01:15:44,534
We know that Mr. Ramdev!

882
01:15:44,600 --> 01:15:46,568
But the agents who will
work under you..

883

''..they know English and they
speak English, that is why..''

884
01:15:50,100 --> 01:15:52,202
''Sir, you are concerned only
about the accounts. Isn't it?''

''Sir, you will see! You iust

''Be only mine, and do

Do not go away from me.

01:17:36,566 --> 01:17:40,970
''l am the same, you are the same.''

903
01:17:41,033 --> 01:17:44,870
Everything here is the same.

01:17:44,933 --> 01:17:53,574
''But l do not why something
is looking different here.''

905
01:17:56,333 --> 01:18:04,574
''This atmosphere, this
world has changed.''

906
01:18:04,833 --> 01:18:13,274
''Our eyes have said such
things to each other.''

907
01:18:17,433 --> 01:18:22,037
''Love you unconditionally,
oh my beloved.''

908
01:18:30,899 --> 01:18:41,844
''Be only mine, and do
not go away from me.''

909
01:18:44,066 --> 01:18:48,270

Do not go away from me.

01:19:10,366 --> 01:19:13,836
''Hello! Please give the
phone to Megha, Ankush.''

912
01:19:16,566 --> 01:19:23,339
Hello! Hello!
- Megha! - Ankush! Hello! Hello!

913
01:20:05,899 --> 01:20:07,468
''Brother, please give me
hundred rupees change.''

914
01:20:10,033 --> 01:20:13,269
Ankush!
- Hey Dheeraj! You are still here!

915
01:20:15,233 --> 01:20:17,568
''Sir, l do not have.''

916
01:20:17,633 --> 01:20:19,434
''Are you doing business, or are
you just passing your time?''

917
01:20:19,500 --> 01:20:20,567
Look again!

918
01:20:22,833 --> 01:20:25,035
Do you think that you will find her?

919
01:20:25,366 --> 01:20:28,869
''My brother, this is Delhi! And
here people vanish in minutes.''

920
01:20:28,933 --> 01:20:31,402
And you are looking for that girl
who vanished mo months back.

921
01:20:31,466 --> 01:20:33,935
She had come here! We were
supposed to meet here.

922
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:35,201
Where else can she go?

923
01:20:35,266 --> 01:20:36,300
Are you going to search
your entire life?

924
01:20:36,366 --> 01:20:38,468
''As it is l am giving you change,
and you are warning me.''

925
01:20:38,533 --> 01:20:40,434
''Yes, you are giving me change.''

926
01:20:42,033 --> 01:20:44,835
You listen to me! You go back!

927
01:21:00,100 --> 01:21:07,040
''What happened? Ankush,
what happened?''

928
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,335
We will find another way.

929
01:21:13,300 --> 01:21:15,201
But what did they say to you?

930
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:33,001
Why are you frightening me?

931
01:21:33,899 --> 01:21:35,968
My heart stopped beating
Iooking at your face.

932
01:21:38,333 --> 01:21:43,137
Are you acting smart with me?
Mr. area supervisor?

933
01:21:48,033 --> 01:21:53,471
Now you will iust have to learn
English. l will teach you.

934
01:21:55,633 --> 01:22:00,437
''Megha, shall we both get married?''

935
01:22:03,500 --> 01:22:05,869
We have told everything
to Father Pinto.

936
01:22:07,833 --> 01:22:09,834
Now my iob is also finalised.

937
01:22:11,100 --> 01:22:13,936
ln a month's time l will
take you away from here.

938
01:22:14,066 --> 01:22:16,067
We will have a house of our own.

939
01:22:17,966 --> 01:22:19,267
''You will stay with me, won't you?''

940
01:22:28,366 --> 01:22:30,835
Can l give my answer
aRer a few days?

941
01:22:42,300 --> 01:22:43,834
''Greetings, Aunt!''

942
01:22:43,899 --> 01:22:45,901
Oh my God! You scared me!

943
01:22:45,966 --> 01:22:47,000
How are you?

944
01:22:47,066 --> 01:22:48,834
You will keep quiet aRer a
good beating from the police.

945
01:22:48,899 --> 01:22:49,967
What are you talking
about the police..

946
01:22:50,033 --> 01:22:51,367
..you can call the military too.

947
01:22:51,433 --> 01:22:54,569
You were the first person
to know about Megha and me.

948
01:22:54,633 --> 01:22:57,068
''You saw everything before,
aunt you are great!''

949
01:22:57,166 --> 01:23:01,303
''Aunt, what will she say?
- Who? - Megha!''

950
01:23:01,899 --> 01:23:05,203
The thing is that l asked
her for marriage.

951
01:23:05,266 --> 01:23:07,134
She said that she would
tell me later.

952
01:23:08,899 --> 01:23:09,934
What should l do?

953
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,569
''At the moment, you go
away from here. Stupid!''

954
01:23:15,899 --> 01:23:20,237
''My dear, are you iealous that l
am going away with someone else?''

955
01:23:20,300 --> 01:23:24,837
''You stupid, you fool! What
rubbish are you talking?''

956
01:23:24,899 --> 01:23:28,503
''Aunt, you know that
l roam with loafers.''

957
01:23:28,899 --> 01:23:31,335
Nobody understands
me better than you.

958
01:23:31,399 --> 01:23:32,968
You know me! You understand me!

959
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:40,272
There is uneasiness inside
me. What will she say?

960
01:23:43,899 --> 01:23:49,071
She will say yes. And if she
doesn't then slap her.

961
01:23:50,033 --> 01:23:52,135
You have done so much for her.

962
01:23:52,199 --> 01:23:53,935
''She has to say yes, other wise
what else will she say?''

963
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,836
Otherwise too she does not have
anyone here besides you.

964
01:24:01,166 --> 01:24:02,834
So l will go to the
marriage office..

965
01:24:02,899 --> 01:24:04,935
..and give the notice.

966
01:24:05,966 --> 01:24:10,370
''Then what! A iob worth
20,OOO, a house..''

967
01:24:10,433 --> 01:24:12,468
''A iob worth 20,OOO!''

968
01:24:12,533 --> 01:24:16,103
''Aunt, l take your oath! This tie,
this shirt, this pant..''

969
01:24:16,166 --> 01:24:17,567
..all this is because of the iob.

970
01:24:17,633 --> 01:24:20,002
She will change me for the better.

971
01:24:20,066 --> 01:24:22,034
lf she would not have been there..

972
01:24:22,100 --> 01:24:23,835
..then l would have married you.

973
01:24:23,899 --> 01:24:25,568
You stupid! You idiot!
You started once again.

974
01:24:28,633 --> 01:24:31,335
You come to my house and
misbehave with me.

975
01:24:31,399 --> 01:24:33,301
Nobody has ever taught you manners?

976
01:24:33,366 --> 01:24:36,402
You are shameless! Get
out of my house.

977
01:24:37,899 --> 01:24:39,835
What are you doing?

978
01:24:39,899 --> 01:24:43,570
Where is everybody? Just see
what this boy is doing?

979
01:24:43,633 --> 01:24:45,901
Raiiu! Raiiu!

980
01:24:45,966 --> 01:24:47,133
Good-bye! Fatso!

981
01:24:49,933 --> 01:24:52,235
Raiiu! Let that fatso shout!

982
01:24:52,300 --> 01:24:54,168
''When her anger cools down,
then give her the ladder.''

983
01:24:54,233 --> 01:24:55,901
Raiiu! Raiiu!

984
01:26:38,466 --> 01:26:39,900
'What is this?'

985
01:26:39,966 --> 01:26:42,501
''Megha, now we will meet
in Delhi on the 25th.''

986
01:26:43,300 --> 01:26:44,834
The marriage registration
o_ice address..

987
01:26:44,899 --> 01:26:46,501
..is on the backside
of this bus ticket.

988
01:26:46,633 --> 01:26:49,235
lt will be better that
we go separately.

989
01:26:50,333 --> 01:26:51,834
''You will meet me there, isn't it?''

990
01:26:51,899 --> 01:26:54,502
''Yes, l will be there before you.''

991
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,669
''Chhotu, give me a cup of tea.''

992
01:27:55,933 --> 01:27:58,235
''Ankush brother, the
police have come.''

993
01:27:58,300 --> 01:27:59,467
To catch you!

994
01:27:59,533 --> 01:28:02,002
They are inquiring
about Megha sister.

995
01:28:02,066 --> 01:28:03,934
''Yes, the police are
inquiring about her.''

996
01:28:08,066 --> 01:28:12,203
''Ankush, the police are inquiring
a lot about your girl.''

997
01:28:12,266 --> 01:28:13,934
l denied everything.

998
01:28:15,933 --> 01:28:18,935
Have you seen her?
- This one!

999
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:20,935
She had come here mo months back.

1000
01:28:23,100 --> 01:28:30,140
''Sir, this girl.. if this girl would
have come in front of me..''

1001
01:28:30,199 --> 01:28:31,935
''..then, l would have recognised her.''

1002
01:28:34,600 --> 01:28:37,936
lt is very suffocating! No peace..

1003
01:28:40,933 --> 01:28:42,534
''Why does this happen, my friend?''

1004
01:28:42,933 --> 01:28:45,135
Didn't he get any other
time to come here?

1005
01:28:45,199 --> 01:28:47,235
''Where was he, when she was
standing on the road?''

1006
01:28:47,300 --> 01:28:49,235
He has come here a_er mo months.

1007
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:54,537
And l should sit idle? Does
he think it to be a joke?

1008
01:28:54,600 --> 01:28:57,602
''My dear, get married. The
matter will end there.''

1009
01:28:57,666 --> 01:28:59,367
As it is one month will
pass like this.

1010
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,569
l have to even give a notice
to the marriage office.

1011
01:29:02,633 --> 01:29:03,934
And if this man sticks
here for a month..

1012
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,001
..then it is definite
that they will meet.

1013
01:29:06,066 --> 01:29:08,935
So let them meet!
- What are you blabbering?

1014
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,335
Why?
- Anything can happen.

1015
01:29:11,399 --> 01:29:12,934
He may influence her in any way.

1016
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:16,303
''Ankush, he has deceived that girl.''

1017
01:29:16,966 --> 01:29:18,667
Do you think that she will
come under his influence?

1018
01:29:20,600 --> 01:29:23,102
No!
- Then why are you scared?

1019
01:29:23,166 --> 01:29:25,134
And suppose she goes away with him..

1020
01:29:25,199 --> 01:29:27,302
..then you must realise
that she was never yours.

1021
01:29:28,066 --> 01:29:29,934
''l am not some film hero, that
l will give the girl away..''

1022
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:31,935
..and then sing some song.

1023
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:33,234
l am not so large hearted.

1024
01:29:34,433 --> 01:29:39,671
Oh my God!
- We will have to do something.

1025
01:29:40,566 --> 01:29:41,934
Dheerai will have to be
taken away from Delhi..

1026
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:43,434
..and that too very soon.

1027
01:29:44,533 --> 01:29:49,938
Hey! Why are you worried?
l will do your work.

1028
01:29:51,333 --> 01:29:53,001
l will do it!

1029
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,469
Dheerai!
- Yes! - Rajesh!

1030
01:30:26,533 --> 01:30:28,301
Tell me; what do you
know about Megha?

1031
01:30:33,066 --> 01:30:35,435
''Friend, she has gone!
- What?''

1032
01:30:37,066 --> 01:30:42,237
l had seen her at the railway
station. - When?

1033
01:30:42,933 --> 01:30:46,636
About 40 days back. l had
gone to leave my aunt.

1034
01:30:46,699 --> 01:30:47,934
Which station?

1035
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,936
''Old Delhi! You go straight from
here, to the right side.''

1036
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:52,067
lt is a straight road.

1037
01:30:52,166 --> 01:30:55,102
What was Megha doing at
the railway station?

1038
01:30:55,166 --> 01:30:59,570
She was not alone. There
was a man with her.

1039
01:30:59,633 --> 01:31:01,368
Man?
- Yes!

1040
01:31:02,933 --> 01:31:05,669
See this! Look at this carefully!
Was this the girl?

1041
01:31:05,733 --> 01:31:08,535
''Yes, this one.. this
is the same girl!''

1042
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,502
And that day there was a lot
of light in the train.

1043
01:31:11,566 --> 01:31:13,334
My eyes can never betray me.

1044
01:31:14,133 --> 01:31:16,201
She was sitting in front
of me for ten minutes.

1045
01:31:16,933 --> 01:31:18,200
This is the same girl.

1046
01:31:18,333 --> 01:31:20,968
Tell me one thing!
- Yes?

1047
01:31:21,033 --> 01:31:23,168
Where was the train heading?
- Mumbai

1048
01:31:23,233 --> 01:31:24,934
Which one?
- Rajdhani!

1049
01:31:26,066 --> 01:31:27,667
Raidhani from Old Delhi?

1050
01:31:27,733 --> 01:31:30,936
But Raidhani leaves from New Delhi.

1051
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:36,472
Yes.. that.. that day one must
have gone from Old Delhi.

1052
01:31:36,533 --> 01:31:38,601
You know how the trains are.

1053
01:31:38,666 --> 01:31:41,468
''Hey, Raiesh!
- Yes!''

1054
01:31:41,533 --> 01:31:48,673
Who are you? What is the matter?
Tell me! - No!

1055
01:31:48,733 --> 01:31:50,568
''What do you know about, Megha?''

1056
01:32:33,933 --> 01:32:36,535
Run! Run fast!

1057
01:32:43,266 --> 01:32:44,400
What happened?

1058
01:32:45,033 --> 01:32:47,435
He sensed.. he sensed something!

1059
01:32:47,500 --> 01:32:49,368
You had boasted!
- So what could l do?

1060
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,469
He started interrogating
like a policeman.

1061
01:32:52,533 --> 01:32:53,600
You are a fool!

1062
01:32:53,666 --> 01:32:57,269
We will send Pipley.
- Do you have any brains?

1063
01:32:57,333 --> 01:33:01,403
He is already suspicious. We will
have to find some other way.

1064
01:33:22,933 --> 01:33:29,606
You? Here?
- Can l come in? - Come.

1065
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:37,937
Are you alone?
- What is the matter?

1066
01:33:39,266 --> 01:33:41,034
l am coming from the
municipal office.

1067
01:33:41,100 --> 01:33:43,001
l always have some work there.

1068
01:33:43,133 --> 01:33:45,201
l iust casually asked there!

1069
01:33:47,100 --> 01:33:48,668
The police also had come there.

1070
01:33:49,633 --> 01:33:50,934
Due to some peon's carelessness..

1071
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,602
..the matter was not known to them.

1072
01:33:56,133 --> 01:34:00,003
What is it?
- That.. Megha Joshi.

1073
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:05,670
What is this?
- Read it! You will understand.

1074
01:34:29,566 --> 01:34:36,072
''Dheerai, this is Megha Joshi's
death certificate.''

1075
01:34:38,933 --> 01:34:40,434
Her name is written in this.

1076
01:34:42,100 --> 01:34:45,269
They found her dead body
on the 29th of October.

1077
01:34:46,199 --> 01:34:52,339
On the railway tracks. 5 112 feet.

1078
01:34:53,933 --> 01:34:55,367
Everything is written in this.

1079
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:01,603
These are official papers.
They cannot be wrong.

1080
01:35:07,066 --> 01:35:11,970
Sorry! l thought it would
be better to inform you.

1081
01:36:08,733 --> 01:36:12,670
The iob is done?
- Yes!

1082
01:36:13,633 --> 01:36:15,668
''Well done, guru! You are great!''

1083
01:36:15,933 --> 01:36:17,067
What has he done?

1084
01:36:17,133 --> 01:36:20,936
Our Ankush has fooled
him in such a way..

1085
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,936
..that he will never know about it.

1086
01:36:24,933 --> 01:36:28,036
That fool! He was trying to act
very smart in front of me.

1087
01:36:28,100 --> 01:36:29,668
''Enough, Zulfu!''

1088
01:36:30,933 --> 01:36:32,934
At least tell me; what has he done?

1089
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,669
Leave that! Just salute our friend.
l will salute him.

1090
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:39,136
That fool! God knows
from where he came?

1091
01:36:39,199 --> 01:36:41,502
Now iust see! The
whole of his life..

1092
01:36:41,566 --> 01:36:43,467
''..he will keep searching for her,
but he will never find out.''

1093
01:36:43,533 --> 01:36:45,067
Heep quiet now! It is enough!

1094
01:36:45,133 --> 01:36:47,935
lt is okay! As if he
is going to know..

1095
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:51,169
..that my friend is
benefiting from this.

1096
01:36:55,066 --> 01:36:56,934
l have been telling you since
a long time to be quiet.

1097
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:58,267
But you keep blabbering.

1098
01:36:59,266 --> 01:37:01,134
You slapped me in front of everyone?

1099
01:37:01,933 --> 01:37:03,434
''My friend, l have helped you.''

1100
01:37:03,500 --> 01:37:04,934
What filthy things are you saying?

1101
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:06,134
Don't you understand?

1102
01:37:06,199 --> 01:37:10,137
What wrong have l done?
l was just praising you.

1103
01:37:14,966 --> 01:37:19,670
Okay sorry! Zulfu!

1104
01:37:43,933 --> 01:37:45,000
Dheerai!

1105
01:37:53,466 --> 01:37:57,469
''Sir, l am knocking on the
door since a long time.''

1106
01:37:57,533 --> 01:37:58,667
He is not opening the door.

1107
01:37:58,733 --> 01:37:59,967
He must be sleeping.

1108
01:38:00,033 --> 01:38:01,267
''Yes, but even then..''

1109
01:38:02,033 --> 01:38:04,101
That man has not gone an_here.

1110
01:38:04,166 --> 01:38:05,233
Then please come with me.

1111
01:38:05,366 --> 01:38:07,401
''Sir, what is this?''

1112
01:38:07,466 --> 01:38:08,667
''Sir, only mo minutes; please!''

1113
01:38:11,933 --> 01:38:15,536
Okay! Come!

1114
01:38:38,600 --> 01:38:43,104
Dheerai! Dheerai!

1115
01:38:56,933 --> 01:38:58,401
Go away from here!

1116
01:39:18,733 --> 01:39:20,367
Listen!
- Yes!

1117
01:39:20,433 --> 01:39:22,501
This is his residential
number. From Nanital.

1118
01:39:22,566 --> 01:39:25,201
Call them and inform them that
Dheeraj is here in your lodge.

1119
01:39:26,133 --> 01:39:27,934
''Tell them that he is not
well, so someone..''

1120
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,001
..please come here
and take him away.

1122
01:39:34,600 --> 01:39:36,935
''And yes, do one thing! Make
some arrangements..''

1123
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:39,602
..for his food. Okay?
- Okay.

1124
01:39:39,733 --> 01:39:42,202
But what is wrong with him?

1125
01:39:42,266 --> 01:39:46,436
He is.. iust take care of him.

1126
01:39:46,500 --> 01:39:47,601
Till someone does not come for him.

1127

And don't forget to call
his home. Okay? - Yes.

1128
01:40:02,966 --> 01:40:06,436

You are wondering what is
my answer to your question.

My answer is yes!

1134

Megha that..
- And if you do not learn English..

..how will you understand?

1136
01:40:39,699 --> 01:40:41,468
Ankush do not worry.

1137
01:40:45,933 --> 01:40:49,069
''Some days back, you had asked
me a question, isn't it?''

1138
01:40:54,266 --> 01:40:56,134
''My answer is, yes!''

1139
01:41:00,733 --> 01:41:05,170

Are you not happy with

So what do you think that

''Megha, in the last five years,

01:46:59,199 --> 01:47:00,434
..me only so much?

1194

''Dheerai, you go away from here!''

1195
01:47:01,699 --> 01:47:04,269
''Megha, do you think that

01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:25,067
..is all because of him.

1205
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:27,935
lf he would not have been there..

1206
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:29,935
..maybe l would have
committed suicide.

1207
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:31,668
Where would l have gone?

1208
01:48:32,666 --> 01:48:34,667
''Megha, you are iust thinking
about yourself.''

1209
01:48:36,266 --> 01:48:38,234
What spell has he cast on you?

1210
01:48:39,066 --> 01:48:41,201
He can stoop very low.

1211
01:48:41,266 --> 01:48:42,333
You do not know him!

1212
01:48:44,933 --> 01:48:47,335
Now l feel as if l do not know you.

1213
01:48:51,333 --> 01:48:55,570
Okay Megha! You do what
you think is right.

1214
01:48:56,133 --> 01:48:59,536
But only once.. iust once..
for old time's sake.

1215
01:48:59,600 --> 01:49:01,635
Do you not want to listen
to what happened with me?

1216
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,502
''Megha l was coming here, to Delhi.''

1217
01:49:15,533 --> 01:49:17,234
But iust see my fate!

1218
01:49:17,300 --> 01:49:19,335
Just move this bag!

1219
01:49:19,399 --> 01:49:21,602
There was a bag in the passage.

1220
01:49:21,666 --> 01:49:22,933
So that it should not
come in the way..

1221
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:24,101
..l moved it under my seat.

1222
01:49:24,166 --> 01:49:25,667
God knows whose bag was it.

1223
01:49:25,733 --> 01:49:27,000
Come!
- What happened?

1224
01:49:27,066 --> 01:49:28,133
You are carrying a bomb with you?

1225
01:49:28,199 --> 01:49:29,267
l will teach you a lesson!

1226
01:49:29,333 --> 01:49:30,934
But what happened?

1227
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:34,435
l was in iail for a month.

1228
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:38,935
''Sir, l am not involved in this!''

1229
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:40,668
l was iust travelling
from Nainital to Delhi.

1230
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:43,135
''Sir, we were going to
elope and get married.''

1231
01:49:43,199 --> 01:49:45,168
l do not know what state
she must be in?

1232
01:49:45,266 --> 01:49:48,569
''Sir, she does not know
anyone in Delhi.''

1233
01:49:48,633 --> 01:49:49,934
So for whose wedding procession..

1234
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:51,668
..were you carrying that RDX?

1235
01:49:51,733 --> 01:49:53,000
Sir that bag was not mine.

1236
01:49:53,066 --> 01:49:54,400
Then whose bag was it?

1237
01:50:03,133 --> 01:50:05,201
When l regained consciousness..

1238
01:50:05,266 --> 01:50:06,934
..l was in hospital.

1239
01:50:08,100 --> 01:50:13,004
And Megha; every minute l was
just thinking about you.

1240
01:50:14,033 --> 01:50:15,934
As to in which state you would be.

1241
01:50:16,933 --> 01:50:18,000
How you would be?

1242
01:50:20,266 --> 01:50:22,468
This worry was eating
me up from within.

1243
01:50:32,133 --> 01:50:34,201
And as soon as l was discharged
from hospital..

1244
01:50:34,266 --> 01:50:37,102
''..l came to Delhi, in search of you.''

1245
01:50:38,133 --> 01:50:40,568
''Since the past ten days,
l am searching for you.''

1246
01:50:42,266 --> 01:50:46,003
Do you still think that
l have betrayed you?

1247
01:53:07,033 --> 01:53:08,601
Ankush had come!

1248
01:53:25,266 --> 01:53:32,006
''Megha! l made a mistake, Megha!''

1249
01:53:32,066 --> 01:53:34,435
l did not think about
what l was doing.

1250
01:53:35,066 --> 01:53:36,934
l lied to Dheerai.

1251
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:39,102
l made your death certificate and..

1252
01:53:39,166 --> 01:53:40,934
''Ankush, l know why you did this?''

1253
01:53:41,466 --> 01:53:44,001
You do not have to explain
anything to me.

1254
01:53:44,066 --> 01:53:45,500
l can understand!

1255
01:53:54,933 --> 01:53:58,936
''Ankush, you have done
a lot for me. A lot!''

1256
01:54:01,066 --> 01:54:02,667
You supported me!

1257
01:54:03,433 --> 01:54:07,670
You showed me a new way of life.

1258
01:54:10,266 --> 01:54:14,069
You were the only one with
me for the last mo months.

1259
01:54:15,266 --> 01:54:17,368
ln every step! In every difficulty!

1260
01:54:19,100 --> 01:54:21,268
lf you would not have been there..

1261
01:54:27,133 --> 01:54:28,934
Today we are at the same place..

1262
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:30,067
..where we met for the first time.

1263
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:40,302
Now the di_erence is we..

1264
01:54:47,033 --> 01:54:53,606
''Now Dheerai has come, and
l do not know what to do?''

1265
01:55:00,966 --> 01:55:03,001
What happened with him was very bad!

1266
01:55:04,366 --> 01:55:09,437
And l.. l never thought about him.

1267
01:55:11,199 --> 01:55:13,302
And he kept on thinking
of me all the time.

1268
01:55:19,500 --> 01:55:21,201
''Ankush, what am l supposed to do?''

1269
01:55:26,500 --> 01:55:28,101
You are great!

1270
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:32,937
You ask questions and
you answer them too.

1271
01:55:45,466 --> 01:55:47,935
l have reached an unknown
destination.

1272
01:55:52,100 --> 01:55:53,935
l was so di_erent mo months back.

1273
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:58,669
Just an ordinary witness.

1274
01:56:00,333 --> 01:56:06,672
And now.. you have changed me a lot.

1275
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:12,035
l have learnt a lot from you.

1276
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:19,169
Are you scared that l
will be disheartened?

1277
01:56:19,233 --> 01:56:20,667
That l will become a Devdas?

1278
01:56:22,133 --> 01:56:24,001
But this will never happen!

1279
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:28,135
And l do not want your favours.

1280
01:56:28,199 --> 01:56:30,101
''That is why you had
said yes, isn't it?''

1281
01:56:39,666 --> 01:56:44,937
Whatever l did; l did not
do any favour on you.

1282
01:56:45,933 --> 01:56:50,070
lt was my mistake! l mistook
your friendship for love.

1283
01:56:52,933 --> 01:56:55,669
Friend! You iust take
me to be your friend.

1284
01:57:02,333 --> 01:57:04,201
You know what you have to do.

1285
01:57:05,733 --> 01:57:20,481
Ankush! - Do you love me! If
you love me; then say so.

1286
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:55,336
Hey! My hero! Get me tea.

1287
01:57:56,933 --> 01:57:58,134
Go my prince!

1288
01:58:08,100 --> 01:58:09,434
My friend; this has become crooked.

1289
01:58:15,733 --> 01:58:17,134
Even l had misbehaved.

1290
01:58:20,333 --> 01:58:25,071
Hey Pipney! Forgive me!

1291
01:58:54,600 --> 01:58:58,937
Thank you! Where are their
witnesses? Call them.

1292
01:59:17,933 --> 01:59:20,101
Congratulations! Happy married life.

1293
01:59:28,433 --> 01:59:34,305
Ankush! Thank you!

1294
01:59:36,933 --> 01:59:39,435
You have returned
my life back to me.

1295
01:59:39,500 --> 01:59:40,934
Thank you very much!

1296
01:59:43,333 --> 01:59:46,569
200 rupees!

1297
01:59:58,933 --> 02:00:00,434
Thank you!
