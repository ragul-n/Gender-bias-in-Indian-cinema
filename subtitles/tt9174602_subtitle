Not a good idea, no?

You in a modern dress?
No...no!

My princess is good as gold, right?

93
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,840
You shouldn't pester
your grandpa and grandma, okay?

Go back in 3 months?

95
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,440
Why not after 10 months?
She'll have company too!

96
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:19,200
We haven't even brought Pooja here
And you want 1 more

Here you go

107
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,840
- Why have you given me Rs 20?
- In our currency it is 40

108
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,560
I meant Mauritian rupee

109
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,000

- Hey! Wait, madam

110
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,320

I'm not to blame, madam

127

00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,600
You even remind me of my aunt

Don't end up calling me 'chithi'
I am not middle aged like your aunt

- Who is that girl?
- Which girl?

165
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:20,120
You claimed you were going to the loo

166
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:24,480
And then I saw you coochey cooing
with some random female

167
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,520
Maria, dear
My colleague

168
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,200
If she is your colleague
why send me away and talk to her alone?

169
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,600
You can talk in front of me

170

Introduce

173
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,320
Not worth it, dear

174
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,960
I'm not worth it, huh?

175
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,360
[spluttering]

176
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,200

I meant her
Mariu!

178
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,480
You are soooo beautiful
How can you compare her with you?

179
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,920
You've started lying
after coming here

180
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,600
I'm not lying, dear
You are truly beauuutiful!

181
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,080
Don't change the topic

182
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,480
If you aren't lying-

183
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,480
What?

184
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,760
Swear on our daughter Pooja

185
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,920
Are you mad or what?
Asking me to swear on our baby!

186
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,520
Hugging and all that
is very common here

187
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,840
'And all that' means?

188
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,520
I meant just hugging, period

189
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,560
Go to bed

190
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,640
'Didn't let me eat the yummy dosa'

191
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,240
I understand how you feel

192
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,680
Hugging isn't considered a crime
to file a case, dear

193
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,280
Who hugged whom?
Where, when, why?

194
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,200
Reason is what counts

195
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:32,000
- I don't know, akka
- Who hugged whom?

196
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:35,000
- One girl
- Whom did she hug?

197
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,280
My husband

198
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,400
Your husband?

199
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,520
Er...like this?

200
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,800
Or real tight like this?

201
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,840
Tiiiight like this, akka

202
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,720
Then that's mutual case
Yours is divorce case

203
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:50,960
Tell me
I'll file it

204
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,240
Akka, what do you mean?
How can I do that?

205
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:56,080
Then learn to live with her
under the same roof

206
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:59,160
'Wonder where he is with that girl now!'

207
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,440
"Love! Love me"

208
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,880
"Love! Miss me"

209
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,400
"Love, hit me"

210
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:51,440
"Follow me to eternity
Come, my beauty"

211
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,400
"Love! Love me"

212
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,880
"Love! Miss me"

213
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:02,160
"Love, hit me"

214
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:05,400
"Follow me like crazy"

215
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,240
"Come, Miss World missy"

216
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,120
Note my phone #!

217
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:45,320
"Permit me just once please
to enter with ease"

218
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:52,480
"Can I waltz in via your doe-eye
Or your lovely lips, sweety-pie?"

219
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:55,960
"If you threaten or chase me
I'll get the scare of my life, baby"

220
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:59,680
"I'll profess my love so true
soulfully and sincerely to you"

221
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:03,360
"I feel warm fuzzies, my head so dizzy
My love explodes within me, missy"

222
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,320
"Adrenalin rush sizzling in me, lassie"

223
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,960
Note my phone #!

224
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:49,240
"I hesitated, waited reluctantly
to get the words out eloquently"

225
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:56,280
"Swamped by love, my head was in a whirl
when you glare at me, beautiful girl"

226
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:59,920
"Like a weirdo I stalk you
Don't run away from me, love"

227
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:03,320
"I'm eager to open your soul
Don't wrap it up and run away, girl"

228
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:07,000
"Your eyes spark with fury to scorch me
But your lips part to smile, dearie"

229
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:11,800
"The sky seems to fly within me, my lovely"

230
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,600
Note my phone #!!

231
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:24,240
"Love! Love me"

232
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,760
"Love! Miss me"

233
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,120
"Love, hit me"

234
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,240
"Follow me till eternity"

235
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,040
"Queen of my heart, honey"

236
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,760
'Listen, dear'

237
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,160
Wait

238
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,440
'Devi'

239
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,160
Dev-

240
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,640
Sitting here, huh?

241
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,320
What are you doing here?

242
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,720
I'm tired, dear

243
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,200
I'm starving

244
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,480
Naturally, why won't you get tired
if you rock and roll like that?!

245
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,600
Rock and roll...who?

246
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:10,960
You ran behind a girl
and shamelessly danced around

247
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,960
You are married and you have a child

248
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,360
Any problem back home?

249
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:21,720
Did your father drink again
and create a ruckus with some chicks?

250
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,240
He's old but has no brain-

251
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,120
My father is a drunkard
But not a roadside Romeo!

252
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,360
Romeo?

253
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,840
- Who is that?
- You of course!

254
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,960
- Me?
- Yes

255
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
What do you mean?

256
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,280
Running behind a female
so shamelessly!

257
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,360
I was running behind a girl?

258
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,920
- Where?
- Roadside

259
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,360
Saw me on the road
Did you check in my office?

260
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,840
'Tomorrow is my presentation
I was in a board meeting'

261
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,280
Working my butt out
morning till evening

262
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,600
Imagine how tired
if I dozed in the afternoon

263
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,680
What did I see then?

264
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,840
You mistook someone else
for me what can I do?

265
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,720
No, I'm sure it was you

266
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:56,720
Next time you see him, come over
to my office and meet me also

267
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,040
Only then you'll know

268
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,400
It isn't me!

269
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,440
Wait

270
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,000
Swear on Pooja it wasn't you

271
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:09,400
What's up with you?
Forever asking me to swear on her?

272
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,720
Aiyo! Pooja, my princess

273
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,400
That's just a photo, dear

274
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,880
Dump everyone!

275
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,640
Stop!

276
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,840
Why are you following that girl?

277
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,000
Girl...?

278
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,000
That's my wife, sir

279
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,840
Oh! Sir has all those desires too, huh?

280
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,200
Not in the beginning

281
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,080
Only now, recently
Too much in love

282
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,200
Love, huh?

283
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:43,960
Bloody fellow! If you sing and dance
love will blossom, huh?

284
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,240
Sing and dance?

285
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,800
Sir, this is a case
of mistaken identity

286
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,840
No mistake in our identification

287
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,800
You are the one walking into danger zone
without knowing who she is

288
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:57,760
If I see you once more
besotted by that girl-

289
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,760
You'll find yourself
in a royal soup, understood?

290
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,880
Come on, boys

291
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,680
Hey!

292
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,880
How dare you!

293
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,840
I'll skin you alive, be careful

294
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:21,040
'You ran behind a girl
and shamelessly danced around'

295
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,080
'If you sing and dance
love will blossom, huh?'

296
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,280
Hey Krish!

297
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,400
What happened?

298
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,440
[sound of the wind]

299
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:38,560
[sound of the wind again]

300
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:42,520
'Happy wedding anniversary, dear
Let me wish my son-in-law'

301
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,000
He is in the shower, pa

302
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,280
- What is Pooja doing?
- 'She's asleep, dear'

303
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,560
Devi

304
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,480
I'll call you later

305
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,080
Where's my charger, dear?

306
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,600
Come fast
I'm late for work

307
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,920
Should be fast as lightning

308
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,880
- What is today?
- Why dust this now?

309
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,440
Must be on the sofa
Go, search

310
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,480
Forget everything

311
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,080
Problem is you lack discipline

312
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,680
Here's your charger

313
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,040
- How did you get it now?
- Try asking me anything

314
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,600
- Serve me breakfast
- No, I won't

315
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,160
- Why?
- I forgot!

316
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,440
Forgot?!

317
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:27,240
My dear, your husband can
forget your wedding anniversary

318
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,920
But how can he forget
he is married?

319
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,040
- What do you mean, akka?
- You're too naive

320
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,880
All men are like this

321
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,560
In their newly married phase

322
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:40,120
...like race horses with blinkers on
they can see only us

323
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:43,400
After sometime like the horses
you see in Marina beach

324
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,720
...they will trot around,
eat chickpeas salad and pipe down

325
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:49,400
That too after they have 2 kids

326
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,680
...they will ask us to baby sit
and they will go behind other babes!

327
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,360
Did you face this same fate, akka?

328
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,280
Will I allow it to happen?

329
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,560
Till date reins of my horse
are clutched tight in my hands

330
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:03,720
- What shall I do?
- Do whatever he likes

331
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:07,000
He likes drumstick 'sambar'
and roasted potato curry

332
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,640
He likes vermicelli 'payasam' too

333
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,480
- Food as 'feast', huh?
- Yes, akka

334
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:14,280
Find your way back to
your man's heart via his stomach!

335
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:19,240
If you appease his hunger in the morning
with a feast fit for a king for lunch

336
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:23,600
...your husband's tastebuds will become
slave to your culinary skills, understood?

337
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,880
Excuse me
Mr Krishna?

338
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:33,120
- Krishna from...?
- India

339
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,280
Oh yes, he's not here today

340
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,760
She says he didn't even come
to the office today

341
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,360
Akka, he told me
he was going to work

342
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:44,680
He has come here
Please go and check, ma'am

343
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,960
See, that's his chair
He's not here today

344
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,480
Let me ask her this, wait

345
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,160
Is Maria there?

346
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,040
Look, this is Maria's chair

347
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,960
She's not here
She's on leave

348
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:05,680
She hasn't come either?

349
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,520
Akka!

350
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,720
Hey!

351
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,600
Is your brain in your butt?
Idiot...stupid!

352
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,680
Isha darling

353
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,560
If a girl walks by his side
his brains move to his backside!

354
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,840
- Look at that chap
- Let go of my hands

355
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,480
- Akka!
- Then what?

356
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,320
She's least interested in him

357
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,080
'But he is hot on her heels'

358
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,600
He's a womaniser

359
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:30,080
Men like him should be locked
behind bars for 8 long years!

360
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,040
- No need, akka
- Why?

361
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,720
Krishna, akka

362
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:34,800
Krishna...?

363
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:37,240
Darling, I'll give my life for you

364
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,560
Your Krishna?

365
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,640
Then is she Maria?

366
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,360
Who else?

367
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,960
Someone else

368
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,920
'Good twist!'

369
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Darling..

370
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:58,680
Then your husband's problem
is something else, my dear'

371
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,640
Devi?

372
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,240
Where is she?

373
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,560
Devi...?

374
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,640
Missing

375
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,120
Why does she spend
on all these candles?

376
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,920
Must have been really expensive

377
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,320
She's unnecessarily
making me lose my temper

378
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,560
Ruby?

379
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,640
"Oh my darling baby!"

380
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,720
"I'm your 'jalebi' treat
A round pretzel sweet"

381
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:11,520
"Oh my darling baby!
I'm your round sweet jalebi"

382
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:14,280
"I'm Devi, your true love
You're the wretched fellow"

383
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:17,280
"I'm your wife, always ready
why take in a mistress, tell me?"

384
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:20,080
"I'm Devi, your only wife
You're the sinner in my life"

385
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:23,080
"As your wife I'm always ready
Why another female to go steady?"

386
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:26,240
"Ready, ready...I'm ready, start"

387
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:31,920
"Bloody...bloody, I am very hot"

388
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,680
"Ready, ready...I'm ready, start"

389
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:43,440
"Bloody...bloody, I am very hot"

390
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,880
Oh God...help me!

391
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,400
Want another baby?

392
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,400
Come...come
Hurry up

393
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,960
Wait...wait

394
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,000
All done

395
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,440
So tiny?
Top and bottom?

396
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:14,240
This or this hanky?
You decide

397
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,960
- I'll wear this
- Good choice!

398
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:21,840
"When you have gold, why go in for tin?
When you got a swan, why owl I'm asking?"

399
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:27,480
"Why flour, when turmeric is auspicious?
Why bun versus sweet 'pongal' delicious?"

400
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:30,400
"Look at this beautiful statue
sculpted from a mountain, dude"

401
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,840
"Look at the work of art aglow
perfect from brow to toe"

402
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:39,080
"Krishna, Krishna, o' my Krishna"

403
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:41,960
"Krishna, Krishna, my dear Krishna"

404
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,960
"Ready, ready...I'm ready, start"

405
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:50,880
"Bloody...bloody, I am very hot"

406
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,560
"Ready, ready...I'm ready, start"

407
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,480
"Bloody...bloody, I am very hot"

408
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,520
Hello, who is it?
You want Devi, huh?

409
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:12,280
Don't know if she's at home
She's very much here

410
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:14,560
Hello, ma, tell me
I had dinner...you?

411
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,520
Head ache?
Where is appa?

412
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,240
Drin...hasn't gone to a bar, right?

413
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,840
Why go into all these details now?

414
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,200
Dress change

415
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:30,520
"You have the license to order me
Why steal like a thief stealthily?"

416
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:36,120
"You got the original waiting for your sake
Why go for a Chinese make and fake?"

417
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:39,080
"My mind, soul and body
for you to make a rhapsody"

418
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:42,440
"From my head to toe
is all yours you know"

419
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,800
"Krishna, Krishna, o' my Krishna"

420
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,680
"Krishna, Krishna, my dear Krishna"

421
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:53,720
"Ready, ready...I'm ready, start"

422
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:59,600
"Bloody...bloody, I am very hot"

423
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:05,480
"Ready, ready...I'm ready, start"

424
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:11,120
"Bloody...bloody, I am very hot"

425
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:22,640
- What happened?
- Ghost...ghost!

426
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,320
She is not a ghost

427
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:27,320
- Hi, I'm her friend
- Akka, she is my friend

428
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,400
Lawyer akka

429
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,400
'Vanakkam'

430
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,360
Glad to meet you

431
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,600
What is she doing here?

432
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:34,440
Our wedding anniversary
She helped me dress the way you lik-

433
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,040
I gave her the idea

434
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,320
Your idea sucks!

435
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,320
Get out of my room

436
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,680
How can you hide
in our bedroom?

437
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:44,080
I was only in the bathroom

438
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:47,640
Get lost! Look at her stride
Like Jackie Chan's grandma!

439
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,040
- Get out
- I'm going

440
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,560
Akka, wait

441
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,360
- What are you doing?
- What about you?

442
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,480
What did I do?

443
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:59,080
I thought you were hitting on
only your colleague

444
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,200
I saw you dancing
with another girl on the road

445
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,760
Then you went behind
some other girl at the signal

446
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,920
- So disgusting!
- What are you blabbering?

447
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:08,320
I told you there is
no other woman in my life

448
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,800
If it isn't you
will it become the truth?

449
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,360
Then what I'm seeing is all a lie?

450
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,720
Is that akka also imagining?

451
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,760
- Sir, even I saw you
- Clear out

452
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,240
Chinese pumpkin

453
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:19,480
- Get out now
- I'm on my way out

454
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:23,280
Listen, you have got into
bad company and lost your values

455
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,440
- What have I done wrong?
- Look at your dress

456
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,200
- You like this
- What do I like?

457
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,480
Modern girl
Modern dress

458
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,800
Hey madcap!

459
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,240
That was then

460
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,520
I love Devi

461
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,640
Devi from Muthampatti

462
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,440
I know it's our anniversary

463
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,880
I bought this specially for you

464
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,200
You still don't believe me?

465
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:01,160
I swear on our daughter Pooja

466
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,640
You are the only one in my life

467
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,920
No one else can take that place

468
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,720
No need, shower first
and then sacred ash

469
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,360
Forgive me

470
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,520
I don't know what is happening around me

471
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,720
Stupid of me to misunderstand you

472
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,280
I'm also to blame

473
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,240
I was too stressed at work

474
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:05,480
I should spend time
with you, right?

475
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,680
Let's forget it as a bad dream

476
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,920
Someone cast an evil eye on us

477
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,400
I hurt you, that too on
our wedding anniversary

478
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,320
Tell me today's menu
I'll make it for you right now

479
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,000
No need to cook

480
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:22,880
Not just for me

481
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:25,160
Hereafter Sundays are off for you too

482
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:27,800
'Pah! Wow!!'

483
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:31,120
'No one can beat me in framing
a picture in this world!'

484
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,480
Slowly...turn now

485
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:35,040
That's it, perfect

486
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,960
This is how you take a video

487
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,440
Come closer

488
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,160
Hey!

489
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,440
Why are you crying, dear?

490
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,960
How could I misunderstand you!

491
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,160
Past is past
Forget it

492
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,080
Icecream?

493
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:02,720
Okay, you sit in that corner
and go all senty about us

494
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,840
Keep clicking snaps
I'll be back

495
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,720
'Hey Sara!'

496
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,240
'Hey, what are you doing?'

497
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:19,480
'Sara, baby
My love!'

498
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:23,360
How many times to tell you
not to stalk me?

499
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,600
Hey! Don't you recognize me?

500
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,560
Hey! What is this?

501
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,200
- Leave me
- I love you!

502
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:31,840
- Please understand, sweetheart
- Leave me

503
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:35,320
- Let go
- Take your hands off

504
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,520
- Won't you do as told?
- What did you say?

505
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,640
Creating a ruckus?
You go, madam

506
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:40,840
Sweet!

507
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:45,680
- Who are you, man?
- Who are you?

508
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,400
'Who are you', huh?

509
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,840
We warned you the other day
Have you forgotten?

510
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,680
Warning...me?

511
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,840
What the hell! I need to tell him
like teaching a parrot!

512
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:59,120
Didn't I warn you if you stalk that girl
you'll be inviting trouble?

513
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Just a sec

514
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,240
Hey Sara

515
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,760
'Indecent bugger!'

516
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,680
- Better clear out
- What happened?

517
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,000
Thank you

518
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,480
Why are you hitting him?
He is innocent

519
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:16,160
- Who are you now?
- Please let him go

520
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:17,960
- Listen to me, bro
- Get lost!

521
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,560
Dai! Go and check

522
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,000
Hey!

523
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,360
Isha darling

524
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,960
- 'How are you, dear?'
- What are you doing here?

525
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,520
- Wretched man!
- Accept my love

526
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,240
Hey! What is wrong with you?

527
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,600
'Are you angry with me, dear?'

528
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:46,760
Drink this coffee

529
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,040
'- Just a sip
- Oh gawd!'

530
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:50,200
'- How can I deal with this?
- Drink a little'

531
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,760
Please taste this coffee

532
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,120
'You don't want?'

533
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:55,880
'- For heaven's sake, let me go
- Why are you angry?'

534
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,040
Irritating!

535
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,160
Isha

536
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,440
'Darling...hey darling!'

537
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,720
Come here

538
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,560
Listen...my dear!

539
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,920
Let go of my hand

540
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,480
Isha...darling!

541
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,640
What is it?
Where did you go?

542
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,440
- Who is she?
- What are you up to?

543
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,720
Isha?

544
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:21,880
Son of a gun!
How dare you grab my collar!

545
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,240
My dear-

546
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,280
Listen, dear

547
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,080
Get out of my way

548
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,160
Listen to me, dear

549
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,840
You son of a gun!

550
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,400
You'll be dead meat

551
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,480
Stop

552
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,080
'Listen to me'

553
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:40,040
- I'll kill you...hey!
- Listen, dear!

554
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,760
- It's me, dear
- You went that side

555
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,360
I told you to wait there
Why are you standing here?

556
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,920
No, I saw you there

557
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,320
What are you looking at?

558
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:54,760
No, dear, you were there
and suddenly you are here now

559
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,120
I told you I was getting icecream for us

560
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:59,480
You-

561
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:00,920
Give me your hand, sir

562
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,160
Poor man! I think he slipped

563
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,040
No, it's alright

564
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,400
He left his shoe behind?

565
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:09,360
His is a size 8
Can't even use it

566
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,080
Let's go

567
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,920
- Mad moron!
- How?

568
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,120
Who is he?

569
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:16,160
Don't know, sir

570
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,800
1st he stalked Sara
and even sang a song

571
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:21,560
When I warned him
now he denies knowing Sara

572
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:25,520
But today we see him targeting Isha
besides stalking Sara

573
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,360
Even goes on his bended knees

574
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:30,760
When I questioned him
he bashed me up, sir

575
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,320
It is really puzzling

576
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,360
Find out more about him

577
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,440
I want to meet him

578
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,960
'You are the only one in my life'

579
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,400
'No one else can take that place'

580
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:13,880
Isha?

581
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:16,800
Isha...?

582
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,240
- Who is it?
- Can I meet Isha?

583
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,600
Isha isn't here
Who are you?

584
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,480
Can I talk to you if you don't mind?

585
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:29,640
What are you saying?

586
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:31,960
Your husband...I don't get it

587
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:34,640
Your daughter knows

588
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:40,000
If he visits her please tell her
not to entertain him

589
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,760
Because he has-

590
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:46,760
A family of his own
and a daughter

591
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:49,400
Sorry, no way you can be right

592
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:52,800
Just like this, a man called
Ranga Reddy stalked my daughter

593
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:55,680
And told me if he ever got married
only Isha will be his wife

594
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:57,920
Poor man!
Died in an accident

595
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:01,400
Isha...hasn't come out of that shock

596
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:05,000
'This is some kind of misunderstanding
Only you must look into it'

597
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,480
Mr Krishna

598
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,160
Some people have come to meet you

599
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,800
Hello, sir

600
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,720
We saw you dance in the mall the other day

601
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:22,840
And song, very impressive

602
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:26,120
We would like you to
perform in our band

603
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,120
Dance?

604
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:32,360
No, sir, I think you have
mistaken me for someone else

605
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,040
No, sir, we saw you that day

606
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,600
We don't mind even paying you $1000 weekly

607
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,320
'Please try and consider'

608
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,840
No, some confusion

609
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,040
Okay sir, then I'll give you my card

610
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:46,320
If in case you change your mind
you please call us

611
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,760
- Okay
- Thank you

612
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,640
We will rock for sure

613
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,280
We are going to sound great

614
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,240
'Falcons is in good form you know'

615
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:15,400
'- See you tomorrow
- I'll head home'

616
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:16,920
- Okay, bye
- Bye bye

617
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,600
- See you tomorrow
- See you

618
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:25,400
Bro, will you follow that car?

619
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,200
'Vanakkam', madam

620
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,080
Hi

621
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:14,840
Who is she?

622
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:17,240
Why is she paying homage with flowers?

623
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,440
She is a singer
in a music band

624
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:24,040
Her band member by name Alex
died in an accident 3 months ago

625
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:28,280
Poor thing! She places flowers
in his grave every week

626
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,200
'I thought you were hitting on
only your colleague'

627
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:41,240
'I saw you dancing
with another girl on the road'

628
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,360
'If it isn't you
will it become the truth?'

629
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,280
'Then what I'm seeing is a lie?'

630
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:43,720
[sound of wind]

631
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:53,600
[sound of wind again]

632
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:02,120
Ruby?

633
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:17,280
- What, dear?
- Huh?

634
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:19,920
Why are you standing here
at this time of the night?

635
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:23,160
What happened?

636
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:37,880
Alex?

637
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:39,560
Hey!

638
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:42,080
What happened?

639
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:43,840
What's the matter?

640
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:46,320
Why did you call me?

641
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:51,080
Cool

642
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:54,360
Ranga Reddy?

643
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:55,960
Hey! Bloody moron!

644
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,320
Why did you call me?
Why am I feeling so tired?

645
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:04,280
Oh my dear! Devi
What happened to you?

646
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:07,080
Why are you standing here
at this time of the night?

647
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:09,440
Wait, I'll get you
a glass of water

648
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,160
'Hey, ma'am'

649
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:22,440
'Namaste'

650
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:29,000
Son of a gun!

651
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:32,280
'I have come!'

652
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:36,480
Akka...sister?

653
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:37,800
'I'm Devi speaking'

654
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:38,920
Yes, dear

655
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:41,480
My husband is possessed

656
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:43,880
Not just 1 spirit, akka

657
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:45,160
2 spirits are within him

658
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:46,920
Akka, I'm terrified

659
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,560
Come immediately

660
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:51,880
Why did you call me and
then not even saying a word?

661
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:53,400
- Akka?
- 'Hello?'

662
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:56,080
Akka, can't you hear me?

663
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:58,480
I can hear you
only if you speak!

664
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:00,280
Akka, my husband is possess-

665
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:02,520
Whom are you talking to, dear?

666
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:03,920
- From home
- What is it?

667
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:04,960
Hello?

668
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,360
My mother...amma

669
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:08,840
She's ill, serious

670
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:10,440
We must leave immediately

671
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:12,040
- Let's leave right now
- Who is sick?

672
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:14,200
- My mother
- She herself spoke to you?

673
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:15,520
Yes

674
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,000
How can we leave all of a sudden?

675
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:20,760
I must book our tickets
and inform my office too

676
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:22,360
We have to go

677
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:24,240
Please...!

678
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:25,560
We have to go

679

Come...quick

680
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:29,040
Wait, let me lock the front door

681
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:32,440
- No need to worry in this place
- I'll lock and come

682
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:34,680
- Amma! I have to go
- Aiyo! Okay

683
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:37,400
We haven't packed anything
Is this bag enough?

684
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:39,800
- Please I must see my mother
- Okay...okay

685
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:41,920
Get inside, sit
What a turn of events

686
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:44,480
- You...you?
- I'm coming, you sit

687
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:47,520
'Amma...!'

688
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:49,200
'You can cry when you get there!'

689
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:56,120
What are you doing, dear?

690
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:57,640
Come

00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:59,040

00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:35,640
Thank you

714
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:37,560
Sit here

715
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:40,640
What are you do-

716
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:45,120
[In-flight announcement]

717
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:05,200
Excuse me, ma'am

718
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:07,680
Please put your seat belt

719
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:09,320
We are landing

720
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:11,040
We are landing

721
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:13,120
'Seat belt, ma'am'

722
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:14,640
Seat belt, sir

723
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:18,520
Bro, didn't we leave Mauritius just now?

724
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:19,840
What are you blabbering?

725
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:22,600
We left India and we are
landing in Mauritius now

726
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:27,200
- Didn't we take off from Mauritius?
- No, ma'am

727
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:30,520
Bloody baldie! How can you
lie through your teeth!

728
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:00,000
All of them are coming back

729
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:05,120
No one around

730
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:14,360
Wretched fellows!

731
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:16,200
'All of them are going back'

732
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:18,360
Bro...listen, bro

733
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:33,200
- Madam, hello
- Where are you going?

734
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:34,720
Go back to the queue

735
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:39,200
You came in the flight with me-

736
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:41,240
When did I travel with you?

737
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:44,240
We've just now patched up!
Go and stand in the queue

738
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:47,400
- Go
- Madam, go back

739
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:50,000
- Go back
- Hurry up!

740
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:51,640
Can't you see the queue?

741
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:55,160
Hello...hello

742
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:56,840
'Your ticket, sir'

743
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:01,920
Akka, didn't you give us
the boarding pass?

744
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,320
They made us disembark

745
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:06,240
Do something and get us into the plane

746
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:08,440
Madam, is something wrong with you?

747
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:14,320
Tickets

748
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:17,360
Passports please

749
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:19,280
God help me!

750
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:25,640
- She asked
- 'Thank you'

751
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:30,120
Good morning, sir

752
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:38,080
Excuse me, madam

753
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:41,320
Isn't he your husband?
Then why aren't you sitting next to him?

754
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:42,920
Because he isn't my husband!

755
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:49,640
Akka, this flight is going to India, right?

756
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:51,680
'Yes, ma'am
We are going to India'

757
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:22,720
Bro, did you see my husband
who was seated here?

758
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:24,560
No one was here
Empty seat

759
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:26,640
Yov! You keep lying all the time

760
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:28,480
Are you blind
if you're with a girl?

761
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:30,600
You saw him with me
He's missing now

762
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:32,040
Where did he go?
Tell me

763
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:33,880
You saw him too
Why are you quiet?

764
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:35,520
Madam, what's the problem?

765
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:37,480
My husband was sitting right here

766
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:39,680
He came with me
and he's missing now

767
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:41,640
Please calm down, ma'am
What's his name?

768
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:42,960
Krishna

769
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:47,080
- Tell me
- No, ma'am

770
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:48,480
His name is not there

771
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:51,160
How can you say that?
He was right here

772
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:52,720
Everyone saw him
Please move

773
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:54,640
- Didn't you see him?
- No

774
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:55,920
How can you-

775
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:58,080
You saw him twice
I know you saw him

776
00:51:58,120 --> 00:51:59,880
- No
- He's lying again

777
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:06,400
STOP THIS PLANE!

778
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:20,720
Sir...sir, this is my house

779
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:23,160
- Go inside
- My husband, sir

780
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:25,120
No, you go inside

781
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:39,560
Where did you trot off to
early in the morning with a bag?

782
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:41,520
- There
- A policeman calls me

783
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:43,200
He wants to know my address

784
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:44,880
Haven't I bought you a phone?

785
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:48,080
I called you twice
Why was your phone switched off?

786
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:50,120
My mother...phone

787
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:52,160
Yes, your mother called

788
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:54,000
I told her you went out shopping

789
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:55,840
Will you call and talk to her?

790
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:00,280
Did I scare you?
I know you got scared

791
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:02,200
Accept you got scared

792
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:05,760
Let's go into the shower together

793
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:13,240
Devi

794
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:14,680
Devi

795
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,400
Meditation in the midst of candles, huh?

796
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:22,320
Er...hello, Devi had called me
So I came over

797
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:23,440
'Devi?'

798
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:25,880
'She called me to tell me
something this morning'

799
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:27,280
'Then she never spoke'

800
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:28,440
'Devi'

801
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:29,680
'Where are you?'

802
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:30,800
'Devi?'

803
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:34,840
Excuse me
Devi called me

804
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:37,160
- That's why I dropped by
- 'Akka'

805
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:39,200
I can hear her
but can't see her

806
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:41,080
- 'Here'
- Devi, where are you?

807
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:42,360
'Up here!'

808
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:46,800
Why are you perched up there?

809
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:48,760
- Ghost!
- Whaaat?

810
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:51,600
Ghost it seems
Aiyo! God save me

811
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:53,000
Aiyo!

812
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:56,400
What has happened to her?
Possessed by a spirit?

813
00:53:56,840 --> 00:53:59,560
'She didn't possess the spirit
The spirit has possessed her'

814
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:00,920
Is that so?

815
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:07,760
Door...open

816
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:09,440
Open the door

817
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:10,920
Door...door

818
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:15,080
Let go of the handle

819
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:21,360
Your hand...good lord!

820
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:26,320
Aiyaiyo!

821
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:27,680
Devi!

822
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:30,600
His hand stretches for a mile!
What to do now?

823
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:32,000
Which way will I run?

824
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:33,800
I'm escaping this way

825
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:38,320
God save me
My back is broken!

826
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:42,040
I am back here...oh gawd!

827
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:43,400
'What will I do?'

828
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:44,520
Phone...phone

829
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:48,320
Bello, I am Lalitha
BA.BL, FRCS speaking

830
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:50,360
Someone please save m-

831
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:53,200
Aiyo! Phone is down

832
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:00,400
I'll escape now

833
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:02,600
My skull has cracked!

834
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:09,200
I am back to square one!

835
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,640
Come down, my dear

836
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:15,680
Come down

837
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:17,840
Please come, my dear

838
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:20,080
Come...come, good girl

839
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:23,200
Thank God
I'm so glad

840
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:26,640
I didn't come down, akka

841
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:28,160
You've climbed up!

842
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:30,640
Am I up there?

843
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:33,640
We can't escape, akka

844
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:36,160
I'm hanging here
after trying everything

845
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:37,440
Thanks a ton, 'ka

846
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:40,160
I was scared of hanging here all alone

847
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:42,040
You wretched female!

848
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:46,720
You used to bug me for a whole hour
asking me how to make 'vaththa kuzhambu'

849
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:51,000
If you had told me in one word
your husband was possessed

850
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:52,920
I would have vanished into thin air!

851
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:54,080
Machiavelli!

852
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:57,480
Now tell me
Which spirit has got into him?

853
00:55:57,840 --> 00:55:59,400
Not spirit, akka

854
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:01,560
- SpiritS!
- Plural, huh?

855
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:04,160
- Two of them
- Double trouble, huh?

856
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:06,360
Yes

857
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,120
I'm Alex

858
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:14,760
I'm Ranga Reddy, I say

859
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:17,400
You'll fly out of the window
with the slightest puff

860
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:20,360
Double action
in this scarecrow body?

861
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:22,680
So many people in this world

862
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:24,520
Why did you choose my husband?

863
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:25,960
Ruby's contact

864
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:29,520
Ma'am, Ruby told us
Krishna is a good fellow

865
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:30,800
He's a good soul

866
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:32,640
'Heart of gold!'

867
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:34,360
Ruby, huh?

868
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:37,120
We haven't added her
in my list, dear

869
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:38,720
Who is Ruby?

870
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:40,440
You don't know, madam

871
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:41,960
Your husband knows

872
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:44,120
We are good friends

873
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:45,720
You know?

874
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:47,320
Friends, huh?

875
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:50,920
For dead souls like us who suddenly
left this earth with a yearning

876
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:54,920
...we need souls like Krishna
to execute our unfulfilled desires

877
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:58,120
He can understand our feelings

878
00:56:58,160 --> 00:56:59,520
Feelings, huh?

879
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:02,280
What is so great
about your feelings?

880
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:03,320
Love

881
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:04,640
Listen, madam

882
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:06,360
Maaad love!

883
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:08,920
I love Isha

884
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:10,560
Yes, I love Sara

885
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:13,840
When Sara and I,
Ranga and Isha spent time

886
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:16,120
...when we wanted to profess our love

887
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:18,120
Ranga and I died

888
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:19,360
Aiyo!

889
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:22,760
But our love is immortal

890
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:25,640
That's exactly why we are back

891
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:30,080
We've come back as spirits
to hear them profess their love to us

892
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:32,080
Should they profess their love for you?

893
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:33,240
He's my husband

894
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:36,160
You are ruining our lives
for your desires to be fulfilled

895
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:38,600
Ruby gave us prior warning
you'll say this

896
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:42,080
That's why we are here
with a contract

897
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:44,280
Read it and then sign

898
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:47,440
What is this contract?

899
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:48,760
Ghost contract

900
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:51,240
Whatever happens, fine
We won't accept this

901
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:53,560
Hello, sisters

902
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:54,880
Yes, brothers

903
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:56,720
We don't want your permission

904
00:57:56,760 --> 00:57:58,560
This is just for your information

905
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:01,760
We won't disturb Krishna
when he's in his house

906
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:04,280
If you disturb us
when he steps outside

907
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:05,760
You can't even if you want to

908
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:07,640
You can't tell anyone either

909
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:09,240
'Do you understand?'

910
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:11,400
Sign the contract now

911
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:13,840
- Sign it, dear
- You too

912
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:17,280
Why do you drag me
in your family affairs!

913
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:18,360
As witness

914
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:20,280
Are you dragging
the lawyer as witness?

915
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:22,080
Just follow my orders!

916
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:26,600
My hand is signing of its own accord!

917
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:48,880
What happened to the case, sir?

918
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:50,200
Sorry, sir

919
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:52,280
Amongst the 3 heirs
of your grandfather

920
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:54,920
...only your mother isn't the legal heir

921
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:57,840
Your grandfather's will
was produced in court

922
00:58:57,880 --> 00:58:59,760
'So our case has become weak'

923
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:05,120
In another 2 hearings, all the assets
will be inherited by your uncles

924
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:09,200
Did you deal with this case
all these years just to tell me this?

925
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:11,520
It's okay

926
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:17,000
He has come!

927
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:25,120
Devi

928
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:31,360
Devi...?

929
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:32,680
Come...come

930
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:34,360
Akka...no need

931
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:36,800
'Devi...?'

932
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:39,800
- Go and talk to him, akka
- You go

933
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:42,200
Let us both go together

934
00:59:43,360 --> 00:59:46,440
You go first
Then I'll follow

935
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:50,080
[muttering incoherently]

936
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:53,880
- Aren't you Krishna?
- What...?

937
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:56,600
- I need to talk to Krishna
- What are your blabbering?

938
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:58,440
What brings you here so early?

939
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:01,240
Devi said you weren't feeling well

940
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:03,680
Are you a lawyer or a doctor?

941
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:05,920
Why are you like a buffoon
in this saint costume?

942
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:10,000
It's just a common belief
saffron robes can ward off spirits

943
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:12,640
I want to talk to you in private...no need

944
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:13,840
Please go ahead

945
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:16,200
You have a problem

946
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:17,880
'I am trying to-'

947
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:22,880
Without crying I'll tell you gently

948
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:25,520
Will you lend me your ears patiently?

949
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:26,600
Tell me

950
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:28,400
You are po...poss

951
01:00:28,440 --> 01:00:30,320
...possessed by spirits!

952
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:32,440
Not just one

953
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:34,200
But 2!

954
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:41,680
Didn't I tell you not to inform Krishna?

955
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:43,600
You are violating the contract

956
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:45,680
You violated it as well

957
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:49,480
You said you won't show yourself
inside the house and you did

958
01:00:49,560 --> 01:00:52,160
You want to inform Krishna
That's it, right?

959
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:55,920
I'll kill him

960
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:58,240
And send him to our world

961
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:00,000
We'll tell him the truth

962
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:02,960
I'll kill Krishna

963
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:04,360
Aiyo!

964
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:07,760
What are you doing?

965
01:01:08,560 --> 01:01:11,360
- Please don't
- 'Don't do this'

966
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:13,840
Ghost brothers, please listen me

967
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:15,240
'We won't inform him'

968
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:17,360
- We won't tell him
- 'Don't harm him'

969
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:19,800
I swear on Krishna
we won't tell him

970
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:23,680
You wanted to
talk to me in private

971
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:25,200
Who are you now?

972
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:26,920
Why do you keep repeating it?

973
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:29,560
- Tell me
- I already spoke to you alone

974
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:32,000
Devi, where did you go?

975
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:33,800
- I wen-
- What happened?

976
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:37,000
I was cleaning the prayer room
I spilt vermilion on my hand

977
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:38,680
- I'm leaving for work
- Wait, dear

978
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:41,320
- Please sit down
- What is it, dear?

979
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:44,520
Don't go to work

980
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:47,880
Doctor wants you
to take rest for 10 days

981
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:49,040
10 days?

982
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:50,760
I must inform my staff, dear

983
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:54,560
Doctor will directly mail
the medical certificates to your office

984
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:56,200
That's the common practice here

985
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:57,760
You are really over stressed

986
01:01:57,800 --> 01:02:00,360
If you take adequate rest
for 10 days, you will be fine

987
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:02,720
After that 'they' will
take care of their work

988
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:04,880
And we can go about our routine

989
01:02:06,040 --> 01:02:07,160
Medicine

990
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:08,440
Prescription...?

991
01:02:08,560 --> 01:02:11,280
That...where did I keep...here

992
01:02:11,320 --> 01:02:12,520
Sweetheart

993
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:15,640
I don't care what the doctor said
You tell me, that will do

994
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:36,800
Watch your step...slowly

995
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:38,520
- Hold him
- Where are we going now?

996
01:02:38,560 --> 01:02:40,800
- Where is the bed?
- This way...this way

997
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:44,280
- We are almost there
- Where?

998
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:45,480
Right here

999
01:02:45,880 --> 01:02:48,120
Watch your step
Slow and easy

1000
01:02:58,480 --> 01:02:59,560
Hi

1001
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:01,440
- Hi, ma'am
- Hi...!

1002
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:03,320
- Nice get-up
- Thank you

1003
01:03:19,720 --> 01:03:21,760
Caaaaa-r

1004
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:30,840
There's no driver inside!

1005
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:33,240
Me...?

1006
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:36,600
Where should I go now?

1007
01:03:37,640 --> 01:03:38,680
To Sara

1008
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:39,800
Right

1009
01:03:39,840 --> 01:03:41,160
Right

1010
01:03:44,560 --> 01:03:46,160
To Isha

1011
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:47,920
Take the next left

1012
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:49,680
Yes, boss!

1013
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:54,680
You bloody fool, right!

1014
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:56,120
'Yes...right'

1015
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:00,600
Bloody female, turn left

1016
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:02,440
Blessed spirit, don't torture me

1017
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:07,360
Look at my plight
Driving for a spirit!

1018
01:04:07,560 --> 01:04:09,480
Right...left

1019
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:11,280
- Right
- Left-u

1020
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:15,640
Aiyo! Akka

1021
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:17,960
Oh gawd! Pillar

1022
01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:20,920
Bus...bus!

1023
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:23,360
'Stop...stop...stop!'

1024
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:26,880
- Akka!
- Not me

1025
01:04:26,920 --> 01:04:28,280
'What's happening here?'

1026
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:29,960
Gho...gho!

1027
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:36,720
'I didn't do anything'

1028
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:40,400
Sara

1029
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:43,720
Sara...honey?

1030
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:45,840
You have to pay the fine

1031
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:47,080
You can't break the law

1032
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:48,800
No, I am a lawyer!

1033
01:04:51,360 --> 01:04:52,640
Hey, Sara

1034
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:54,960
- Sara...!
- Please wait, dear

1035
01:04:55,360 --> 01:04:57,360
My love, hold on

1036
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:01,560
Hey, Sara

1037
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:06,920
Bloody son of a gun! Stop

1038
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:08,680
'Hey, darling! Look here'

1039
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:11,040
Sweetheart
Look behind

1040
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:14,920
Just missed, cha!

1041
01:05:17,960 --> 01:05:19,720
- Please wait
- Sara

1042
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:21,480
Sweetheart...hey!

1043
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:23,560
Honey!

1044
01:05:28,080 --> 01:05:29,720
'Amma said she'll pick me up'

1045
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:31,600
May be she got stuck in the traffic

1046
01:05:31,640 --> 01:05:33,120
Don't disturb your mom again

1047
01:05:33,160 --> 01:05:34,760
I myself will pick up and drop you

1048
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:37,520
Hey, why this unnecessary stress for you?

1049
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:42,520
If we do something for someone
we really like, how can that be stress?

1050
01:05:42,680 --> 01:05:43,880
I like to

1051
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:46,040
I would love to do this you know

1052
01:05:55,360 --> 01:05:56,640
We've reached our home

1053
01:05:56,680 --> 01:05:57,920
Will you please alight?

1054
01:05:57,960 --> 01:05:59,200
Whom are you talking to?

1055
01:05:59,240 --> 01:06:02,120
Who knows who you are now?

1056
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:03,680
This is Ranga Reddy

1057
01:06:03,720 --> 01:06:06,200
Ranga Reddy, let's get down, ready

1058
01:06:07,640 --> 01:06:09,120
Why are you taking this tablet now?

1059
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:10,840
If I go inside without
taking this tablet

1060
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:12,280
...Krishna will come in

1061
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:13,360
He will question you

1062
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:16,840
If you don't answer right
Krishna won't step out

1063
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:21,560
My leg

1064
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:23,520
Lift his leg

1065
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:32,200
Don't get tense

1066
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:33,360
Get up

1067
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:35,800
Come, let's go

1068
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,920
[banging on door]

1069
01:06:49,960 --> 01:06:51,680
Devi, where are you?

1070
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:54,680
The ghosts have started
banging on the door

1071
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:55,800
I'm so scared

1072
01:06:55,840 --> 01:06:57,360
Let's take Krishna out

1073
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:12,240
Only if he comes out
you can possess him, right?

1074
01:07:12,800 --> 01:07:14,160
Krishna won't come out

1075
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:15,560
Listen, ghosts

1076
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:17,520
Let's make a mutually beneficial deal

1077
01:07:17,560 --> 01:07:19,640
As a lawyer let me suggest this

1078
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:23,920
With my thriving practice as a lawyer
let me proudly share something with you

1079
01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:26,920
A minuuuute correction
in your contract

1080
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:28,720
Only if you agree to this...

1081
01:07:28,760 --> 01:07:30,680
...will we send Krishna out

1082
01:07:33,360 --> 01:07:35,840
Stop, don't bring the roof down!

1083
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:38,800
You forced us to sign
only under duress

1084
01:07:38,840 --> 01:07:41,480
This time read our terms
and then duly sign it

1085
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:42,800
Otherwise...

1086
01:07:42,840 --> 01:07:45,160
...I will meet in the court!

1087
01:07:47,120 --> 01:07:49,040
They are subdued now

1088
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:52,000
You had better be wary about me

1089
01:07:52,320 --> 01:07:55,240
Read the contract
and sign on the dotted line!

1090
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:57,400
'Just like your old contract'

1091
01:07:57,440 --> 01:07:59,720
'After love is professed
we will exit Krishna's body'

1092
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:01,680
'We won't touch each other'

1093
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:03,760
'We won't indulge in any magic tricks'

1094
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:06,320
'Apart from all your terms
listen to our conditions'

1095
01:08:06,360 --> 01:08:07,520
Point # 5

1096
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:10,200
We the ghosts...

1097
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:11,640
...under no circumstance

1098
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:13,040
Or any reason

1099
01:08:13,080 --> 01:08:16,120
...won't stay in Krishna's body
at the same time

1100
01:08:16,200 --> 01:08:17,840
Point # 6

1101
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,320
We the spirits...

1102
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:21,360
...only for 6 hours

1103
01:08:21,400 --> 01:08:26,640
That is, from 9:00 a.m to 3:00 p.m
will occupy Krishna's body as Alex

1104
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:30,480
And from 3:00 p.m to 9:00 p.m

1105
01:08:30,520 --> 01:08:35,720
...only as Ranga Reddy
will occupy Krishna's body

1106
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:37,400
And note the point

1107
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:39,360
Sunday is holiday, okay?

1108
01:08:39,400 --> 01:08:40,720
We the ghosts...

1109
01:08:40,760 --> 01:08:43,560
...under no circumstance
or for any reason

1110
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:46,520
...whoever we meet
Sara or Isha

1111
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:48,920
Other than the time allocated to us

1112
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:51,480
...we won't change
into an alternate identity

1113
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:55,000
Without Devi, we won't meet any girl alone

1114
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:56,200
'Most importantly...'

1115
01:08:56,240 --> 01:08:59,400
...we will not kiss
any part of any girl's body

1116
01:08:59,680 --> 01:09:03,360
Remember to follow our post script

1117
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:06,800
Flying hug and flying kiss
Enjoy both in mid-air, not in person

1118
01:09:06,840 --> 01:09:07,960
'We the ghosts...'

1119
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,600
...the moment we hear
our girl profess her love

1120
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:14,760
...we will exit from Krishna's body
the very next second

1121
01:09:15,640 --> 01:09:18,080
We won't stay behind
despite any compulsion

1122
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:21,400
Particularly even if those girls force you

1123
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:24,080
Alex and Ranga Reddy

1124
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:26,040
Only if you agree to all these terms

1125
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:28,240
...we'll agree to bring our Krishna out

1126
01:09:28,280 --> 01:09:29,520
What do you say?

1127
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:32,320
Why are you in a tearing hurry?

1128
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:34,880
Go ahead and sign

1129
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:36,600
Catch my pen

1130
01:09:37,320 --> 01:09:38,400
Both of you sign

1131
01:09:38,440 --> 01:09:39,800
'Do it now'

1132
01:09:56,720 --> 01:09:58,360
That was a good deal!

1133
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:09,640
Hi Sara

1134
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:14,000
Why are you following me?

1135
01:10:14,040 --> 01:10:15,400
Please leave me alone

1136
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:17,080
Sara, try to understand

1137
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:18,640
Don't you recognize me?

1138
01:10:18,680 --> 01:10:21,200
Oh God! She isn't that girl

1139
01:10:21,240 --> 01:10:23,400
Trust me
Please go

1140
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:25,040
- What...?
- Akka, kindly explain

1141
01:10:25,080 --> 01:10:28,840
She isn't the girl you think
You've mistaken her identity

1142
01:10:29,240 --> 01:10:31,360
- Is he your brother?
- Yes, he is

1143
01:10:31,880 --> 01:10:33,040
And she is...?

1144
01:10:33,080 --> 01:10:35,120
My sister...younger sister

1145
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:36,880
Then...?

1146
01:10:36,920 --> 01:10:38,680
My bro...anna

1147
01:10:38,720 --> 01:10:40,200
Anna, please leave her alone

1148
01:10:40,240 --> 01:10:42,360
- Your bro...?
- Come with me

1149
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:44,280
Ma'am, what are you doing?

1150
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:46,280
- 'Let me explain'
- Excuse me

1151
01:10:47,560 --> 01:10:49,080
What is happening here?

1152
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:52,480
Alex, what is your problem?

1153
01:10:52,520 --> 01:10:54,920
You want that girl to profess
her love to you, right?

1154
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:57,840
Did you succeed all these days?
Dead end, right?

1155
01:10:57,920 --> 01:10:59,680
We'll take it from here

1156
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:00,880
Hey...!

1157
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:02,760
- I hate you
- I love you!

1158
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:07,080
A girl who is ditto you

1159
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:10,720
If you compare, you'll be spooked
at the mirror reflection!

1160
01:11:11,560 --> 01:11:13,960
My brother was madly,
deeply in love with her

1161
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:15,600
But she passed away!

1162
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:17,800
- In an accident
- Really...?

1163
01:11:17,960 --> 01:11:19,400
You believe me, right?

1164
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:21,480
But he doesn't!

1165
01:11:22,040 --> 01:11:25,520
He still thinks she's alive
and is following you

1166
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:28,680
We don't know what to do

1167
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:32,200
We'll make sure hereafter
he doesn't disturb you

1168
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:34,800
Turn, she'll call us
I was wrong, huh?

1169
01:11:34,840 --> 01:11:35,880
Excuse me

1170
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:37,000
1 minute

1171
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:39,760
- Did you call us?
- If you don't mind

1172
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:42,360
May I know what happened?

1173
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:47,560
When we feel like sharing...

1174
01:11:48,240 --> 01:11:50,440
...we get choked
and our heart gets heavier

1175
01:11:51,680 --> 01:11:53,240
Give us just 1 day

1176
01:11:53,480 --> 01:11:54,760
We'll tell you

1177
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:02,520
We should've planned this better, right?

1178
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:13,520
Shall we take this scene?

1179
01:12:13,560 --> 01:12:14,800
What is his name?

1180
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:16,760
Krishna...not that name!

1181
01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:19,120
- Krish...Krish
- Krish?

1182
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:21,120
That girl...

1183
01:12:21,160 --> 01:12:22,840
...will she resemble me?

1184
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:24,880
That's where the problem arose

1185
01:12:24,920 --> 01:12:26,360
Show it to her

1186
01:12:29,720 --> 01:12:31,000
She looks exactly like me

1187
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:34,400
Look, even you got confused

1188
01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:37,440
Our brother is so innocent, poor chap!

1189
01:12:40,200 --> 01:12:41,840
What kind of person is Krish?

1190
01:12:41,880 --> 01:12:43,320
Very calm and composed

1191
01:12:44,120 --> 01:12:46,040
Stylish too!

1192
01:12:48,040 --> 01:12:49,680
He has a heart of gold

1193
01:12:50,280 --> 01:12:52,000
But quick to lose his temper

1194
01:12:52,040 --> 01:12:53,400
His fists speak!

1195
01:12:56,040 --> 01:12:58,840
His words are few and far
But his hands compensate!

[adapted from 'Arjun Reddy']

1197
01:13:04,280 --> 01:13:06,600
- Where did he see that girl?
- Who knows!

1198
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:08,040
Where did he see?

1199
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:09,960
Where is love likely to blossom?

"A girl, oho
I saw her you know"

1203
01:13:53,680 --> 01:13:57,280
"With a vermilion halo
she was a golden statue"

1204
01:13:57,440 --> 01:14:01,080
"Oh she was so fair and sweet
she made my heart skip a beat"

1205
01:14:01,120 --> 01:14:07,960
"I am no Lord Rama, firm and faithful
Neither is she Sita devoted and dutiful"

1206
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:11,160
"This is an unrequited love story doleful"

1207
01:14:11,200 --> 01:14:14,840

If you won't love me, I'm single I fear"

1208
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:18,400
"You come near me, 'pongal' festival
If you ignore me, woeful upheaval"

1209
01:14:18,440 --> 01:14:21,600
"I'll call your dad 'uncle' fondly
I'm single for life if you don't love me"

1210
01:14:21,680 --> 01:14:25,280
"You come near me, 'pongal' festival
If you ignore me, woeful upheaval"

1211
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:28,640
"Hey girl, besotted by me, it's true
Don't make me get smitten too"

1212

"Thanks to you, my hiccupping heart pleads
Don't make me lose my head please"

1213
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:42,320
"Girl, you're besotted by me, it's true
Don't make me fall head over heels too"

1214
01:14:42,360 --> 01:14:45,920
"'Cos of you my hiccupping heart pleads
Don't make me a whacko please"

1215
01:14:58,200 --> 01:14:59,520
"Hey! Dingiri baby!"

1216
01:15:04,520 --> 01:15:06,040
'No need, akka'

1217
01:15:07,200 --> 01:15:09,800
- Krishna
- Make them out of focus, dear

1218
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:12,920
My specs!

1219
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:20,680
Interesting beginning?

1220
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:25,080
There pops up a minor litigation

1221
01:15:25,560 --> 01:15:26,840
What happened?

01:15:28,240 --> 01:15:31,080
[adapted from 'Arjun Reddy']

1223
01:15:38,040 --> 01:15:39,560
Aw! Krish
Don't hit me

1224
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:42,560
You said Krish was calm
Is he quick with his fists?

1225
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:53,200
So...he is...not...him

1226
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:55,040
You'll get it-

1227
01:15:56,320 --> 01:15:59,400
You said he's hot tempered
but he's getting thrashed?

1228
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:03,840
Er...that is-

1229
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:05,480
Sara, go

1230
01:16:06,360 --> 01:16:07,680
'Isha, come'

1231
01:16:09,280 --> 01:16:10,560
Son of a gun!

1232
01:16:12,360 --> 01:16:13,880
She got it mixed up!

1233
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:16,960
Aiyo!

1234
01:16:17,080 --> 01:16:24,360
"A fort as tribute for my love I built
Royally she ignores me to the hilt"

1235
01:16:24,440 --> 01:16:31,040
"She trapped me in a web so cleverly
Sliced my heart with love's knife severely"

1236
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:37,840
"Girl, come to me of your own accord
Come in search of me, to strike a chord"

1237
01:16:37,880 --> 01:16:44,720
"Without you in my life I'm a royal mess
Don't kill me slowly, my princess"

1238
01:16:44,760 --> 01:16:48,160
"Hey girl, besotted by me, it's true
Don't make me get smitten too"

1239
01:16:48,240 --> 01:16:52,600
"Thanks to you, my hiccupping heart pleads
Don't make me lose my head please"

1240
01:16:58,480 --> 01:17:01,880

"'Cos of you my hiccupping heart pleads
Don't make me a whacko please"

1242
01:17:05,720 --> 01:17:08,080
Did he profess his love?

1243
01:17:08,520 --> 01:17:12,440
When he was about to
he faced a severe blow

1244
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:15,320
Aiyaiyo!
How sad

I'm telling you I didn't see

1250
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:45,520
- I saw you looking
- What is there for me to see?

1251
01:17:45,560 --> 01:17:47,000
Don't argue
Leave now

1252
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:50,080
Leave my daughter alone
or I'll kill you

1253
01:17:50,120 --> 01:17:51,320
Krish...Krish

1254
01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:53,280
- Don't, Krish
- I will kill your family

1255
01:17:53,560 --> 01:17:55,160
Tell your father

1256
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:57,600
- Krish
- Hey...!

1257
01:17:57,880 --> 01:18:00,360
- I'll show you my true colors
- Krish, please

1258
01:18:01,320 --> 01:18:03,160
What a misunderstanding!

1259
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:04,680
Forget that

1260
01:18:04,720 --> 01:18:06,280
You understanding?

1261
01:18:06,360 --> 01:18:07,640
Under-

1262
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:12,640
Akka, watch that scene

1263
01:18:14,360 --> 01:18:17,000
[adapted from 'Thuppakki']

1264
01:18:20,520 --> 01:18:22,800
He got angry
and joined the army

1265
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:29,040
"Hey girl, besotted by me!
I'm smitten by you totally"

1266
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:30,640
- He became a cop
- 'When?'

1267
01:18:30,720 --> 01:18:32,000
Akka, this scene is good

1268
01:18:32,040 --> 01:18:33,440
- Shall we use it?
- Okay

1269
01:18:33,480 --> 01:18:34,960
Ultimate hero Ajith, akka

1270
01:18:35,040 --> 01:18:36,920
[adapted from 'Mankatha']

1271
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:42,800
"Hey girl, besotted by me!
I'm smitten by you totally"

1272
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:44,480
Was Krish in the military?

1273
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:46,480
Didn't you say he studied medicine?

1274
01:18:46,520 --> 01:18:47,840
Now a police officer?

1275
01:18:50,520 --> 01:18:54,280
Don't ask logical questions
Look into the magic

1276
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:05,240
"My style, my speech all unique, darling
Fuss and ruckus you make is endearing"

1277
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:11,760
"Let me follow you to make you my wife
Don't say no and give me strife"

1278
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:15,280
"Your cheeks are rosy
My precious missy"

1279
01:19:15,320 --> 01:19:18,600
"Speak words of love
my treasure trove"

1280
01:19:18,680 --> 01:19:24,840
"If you and I become 'we'
people's favorite we will be"

1281
01:19:25,320 --> 01:19:28,640
"Hey girl, besotted by me, it's true
Don't make me get smitten too"

1282
01:19:28,720 --> 01:19:33,640
"Thanks to you, my hiccupping heart pleads
Don't make me lose my head please"

1283
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:42,680
"Girl, you're besotted by me, it's true
Don't make me fall head over heels too"

1284
01:19:42,720 --> 01:19:47,560
"'Cos of you my hiccupping heart pleads
Don't make me a whacko please"

1285
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:54,000
[adapted from 'Alaipayuthey']

1286
01:19:56,560 --> 01:19:57,800
That's life!

1287
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:01,680
Our brother is such a pitiable soul

1288
01:20:01,720 --> 01:20:03,400
Unlucky fellow!

1289
01:20:03,640 --> 01:20:06,520
We'll make sure he doesn't
disturb you hereafter

1290
01:20:11,320 --> 01:20:12,920
'You do your bit of what we copied'

1291
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:14,880
She is a carbon copy!

1292
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:16,960
You wanted to ask her for some help

1293
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:18,760
Good girl, she'll definitely comply

1294
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:30,360
We are caught in
some kind of mess

1295
01:20:30,920 --> 01:20:33,280
You don't want me
to find out about it

1296
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:35,800
What is it?

1297
01:20:36,240 --> 01:20:37,320
And why?

1298
01:20:37,880 --> 01:20:39,000
I don't know

1299
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:43,400
But let me request you just this

1300
01:20:44,040 --> 01:20:45,520
Whatever the problem

1301
01:20:48,080 --> 01:20:49,760
Don't abandon me

1302
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:04,040
What, dear?

1303
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:06,480
What are you preoccupied about?

1304
01:21:06,520 --> 01:21:09,000
- Nothing, dad
- What happened?

1305
01:21:10,120 --> 01:21:12,240
I met a lady today, pa

1306
01:21:12,680 --> 01:21:16,120
I was really disturbed
listening to her brother's love story

1307
01:21:16,160 --> 01:21:18,400
'The girl he loved died it seems'

1308
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:19,880
'She looks ditto like me'

1309
01:21:19,920 --> 01:21:21,400
Mentally he's not well

1310
01:21:21,480 --> 01:21:25,320
His sisters want me to profess
my love to him to cure him

1311
01:21:25,400 --> 01:21:28,960
If that will cure a person of his ailment
you shouldn't even think twice

1312
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,720
How can I profess my love
to a random stranger?

1313
01:21:31,960 --> 01:21:33,040
I understand

1314
01:21:33,400 --> 01:21:36,720
Even if you fall in love with a person
you've befriended for a long time

1315
01:21:36,760 --> 01:21:39,280
Sometimes you will tend to hesitate

1316
01:21:40,320 --> 01:21:43,520
Still if someone will benefit
it isn't wrong at all

1317
01:21:43,560 --> 01:21:45,600
- What are you saying?
- Yes, Sara

1318
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:47,560
I think you should help them

1319
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:51,800
'Okay, boys
Get ready'

1320
01:21:57,720 --> 01:21:59,080
Give it to him

1321
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:01,000
This is your last day

1322
01:22:02,040 --> 01:22:04,520
If you go now
you won't come back

1323
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:08,480
Yes, your love is a success
So is our Operation Exit-Spirit

1324
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:11,400
We will meet after 30-40 years

1325
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:16,440
Hand shake

1326
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:24,240
'What's this new car
coming up our driveway?'

1327
01:22:25,160 --> 01:22:26,520
Here I am!

1328
01:22:26,640 --> 01:22:27,880
Hey! Krishna

1329
01:22:27,920 --> 01:22:29,440
Who is this, dear?

1330
01:22:30,600 --> 01:22:31,920
His friend, akka

1331
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:34,320
Ages since I saw you!

1332
01:22:34,360 --> 01:22:36,240
- We are doomed!
- How are you, sis?

1333
01:22:36,280 --> 01:22:38,120
You are even more fair
after coming here

1334
01:22:38,160 --> 01:22:40,080
Who is this?
Chinese chef, huh?

1335
01:22:40,120 --> 01:22:42,000
- Who are you, man?
- Padaiyappa!

1336
01:22:42,040 --> 01:22:43,240
Comedy is your forte!

1337
01:22:43,280 --> 01:22:46,280
You knew I would come
and bought a bouquet for me

1338
01:22:46,320 --> 01:22:47,680
He is my best friend!

1339
01:22:47,720 --> 01:22:49,720
Hey stupid!
Why are you shouting?

1340
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:51,200
Who is this bloody bugger?

1341
01:22:51,240 --> 01:22:54,880
Wondering why he's swearing in English?
That's our habit from childhood!

1342
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:56,360
Hey...hey...hey!

1343
01:22:56,400 --> 01:22:58,360
Just say 'Clear out'

1344
01:22:58,400 --> 01:22:59,400
Out!

1345
01:22:59,440 --> 01:23:02,040
Just to see you I flew
from Dubai to Pollachi

1346
01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:05,120
From my hometown to Chennai
I didn't get a flight here easily

1347
01:23:05,160 --> 01:23:06,720
I finally land here and-

1348
01:23:06,760 --> 01:23:10,320
Why does he talk like a radio jockey
without breathing?

1349
01:23:10,360 --> 01:23:12,000
Who the hell asked you
to come here?

1350
01:23:12,040 --> 01:23:13,800
- Bro, come in
- I'll start crying

1351
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:16,640
How can you ask me to get out?
I got you both married

1352
01:23:16,720 --> 01:23:17,880
Can get out this way also

1353
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:19,600
Don't try to cover up

1354
01:23:19,680 --> 01:23:23,160
Even I have my own pride, self worth
and feel embarrassed, understand?

1355
01:23:23,200 --> 01:23:24,280
I'm leaving

1356
01:23:24,480 --> 01:23:26,440
He belongs to the shameless clan!

1357
01:23:30,760 --> 01:23:32,120
2 minutes

1358
01:23:33,680 --> 01:23:34,960
- Me...?
- 'Go inside'

1359
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,240
Why is 'it' calling me?

1360
01:23:39,160 --> 01:23:40,840
This place is awesome

1361
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:43,480
I can stay put here
for the next 10 days

1362
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,720
Good to see you, bro
He's really stressed at work

1363
01:23:46,760 --> 01:23:48,360
We were taking him
to the doctor

1364
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:51,200
He speaks like that to me too
Don't get mad at him

1365
01:23:51,240 --> 01:23:53,160
That isn't the point
He can be rude to you

1366
01:23:53,200 --> 01:23:56,400
You came into his life today
We go back to our toddler stage

1367
01:23:56,440 --> 01:23:57,920
How can he be rude to me!

1368
01:23:57,960 --> 01:23:59,240
What is the problem?

1369
01:23:59,280 --> 01:24:00,280
Call her

1370
01:24:01,080 --> 01:24:02,240
Sara waiting

1371
01:24:02,280 --> 01:24:04,360
As if she will come
if I call her

1372
01:24:04,400 --> 01:24:05,840
Aiyo! It fell down!

1373
01:24:06,440 --> 01:24:08,760
Alex...wait, don't go inside

1374
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:10,160
Wait!

1375
01:24:11,560 --> 01:24:13,680
What will I do?

1376
01:24:15,040 --> 01:24:17,080
Aiyo! Changed his avatar

1377
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:18,960
'No, don't try to convince me'

1378
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:22,680
'Aiyo! Why is he here?'

1379
01:24:23,400 --> 01:24:24,920
Hey Ganesha!

1380
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:26,560
Hi! When did you come?

1381
01:24:26,640 --> 01:24:29,360
He came just now, we were
catching up with all the news

1382
01:24:29,400 --> 01:24:30,760
You landed all of a sudden?

1383
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:32,400
Surprise, huh?
How is your appa?

1384
01:24:32,440 --> 01:24:34,760
- Don't play the fool
- I told you about his stress

1385
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:38,320
Stress means will you play
Jekyll and Hyde? Will you yell at me?

1386
01:24:38,640 --> 01:24:41,480
- How do you know I'm stressed at work?
- God help me!

1387
01:24:41,560 --> 01:24:43,360
Hey! She's the culprit

1388
01:24:43,400 --> 01:24:44,960
Will you blabber everything?

1389
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,440
Machan, I swear
I was sleeping inside

1390
01:24:47,680 --> 01:24:50,440
- I don't know how I came here
- You forget everything

1391
01:24:50,520 --> 01:24:51,760
'Ghajini' memory!

1392
01:24:51,800 --> 01:24:54,120
- I'll take you to the doctor
- Small capsule

1393
01:24:54,240 --> 01:24:56,520
I consulted a doctor
He has prescribed tablets

1394
01:24:56,560 --> 01:24:58,640
Just 1 tablet makes me sleep 24 hours

1395
01:24:58,720 --> 01:25:01,440
Bro, you can talk to him later

1396
01:25:01,480 --> 01:25:04,400
1st we'll see the doctor
Why don't you refresh yourself?

1397
01:25:04,440 --> 01:25:06,880
Refresh myself?
I'll be staying here for 10 days

1398
01:25:06,920 --> 01:25:08,240
Why should you get stressed?

1399
01:25:08,280 --> 01:25:10,480
- I'll take him to the doctor
- 10 days, huh?

1400
01:25:10,520 --> 01:25:12,440
How will we manage for 10 days?

1401
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:15,240
Why do you keep yakking?
My friend must be starving

1402
01:25:15,320 --> 01:25:18,280
- Serve him a South Indian spread
- Mauritius 'mor kuzhambu'!

1403
01:25:18,320 --> 01:25:19,800
Australian puffed rice 'upma'

1404
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:21,720
I should cook a gourmet meal, huh?

1405
01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:22,880
Am I a grinder?

1406
01:25:22,960 --> 01:25:24,880
To be cooking for all and sundry

1407
01:25:26,080 --> 01:25:27,360
Madam, sorry

1408
01:25:27,440 --> 01:25:29,400
- Me, huh?
- Don't misunderstand

1409
01:25:29,440 --> 01:25:31,440
Can you give us privacy
as a family?

1410
01:25:31,480 --> 01:25:33,200
- She meant you, man
- Not her

1411
01:25:33,240 --> 01:25:34,440
My dear sister!

1412
01:25:34,920 --> 01:25:36,800
- You meant him?
- Yes

1413
01:25:37,160 --> 01:25:39,560
If he comes from India
is this the only place?

1414
01:25:39,640 --> 01:25:41,760
- Isn't there any hotel here?
- Devi!

1415
01:25:41,800 --> 01:25:44,320
Shouldn't a young couple
enjoy time together?

1416
01:25:44,360 --> 01:25:45,440
'True that'

1417
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:47,840
Young...youngsters?!

1418
01:25:49,280 --> 01:25:51,280
You have a 3 year old daughter

1419
01:25:51,320 --> 01:25:53,840
- But this is how close we are!
- Disgusting!

1420
01:25:53,920 --> 01:25:55,920
What are you waiting for?
Tell him to leave

1421
01:25:55,960 --> 01:25:58,920
- How come this female is here?
- Bathroom is my hideout!

1422
01:25:59,120 --> 01:26:02,120
Why stop someone who wants
to go? Let him go

1423
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:04,440
If she is so rude
I'll really leave, da

1424
01:26:04,480 --> 01:26:06,040
Show it in action, go!

1425
01:26:06,920 --> 01:26:09,320
Dai! I can't afford
to stay in a hotel

1426
01:26:09,360 --> 01:26:11,000
I don't know anyone here

1427
01:26:11,040 --> 01:26:13,360
Is that why you thought
I want to stay here?

1428
01:26:14,360 --> 01:26:16,880
Can I stay in your house
only for 10 days?

1429
01:26:16,920 --> 01:26:18,520
Please...please

1430
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:20,920
He is on his way out
You come along

1431
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:22,480
If she talks like this
I'll really go

1432
01:26:22,520 --> 01:26:24,400
- Get out!
- I'm going

1433
01:26:24,520 --> 01:26:26,080
Ganesha...hey!

1434
01:26:26,280 --> 01:26:27,760
Wait, da

1435
01:26:27,800 --> 01:26:28,960
Krishna is stepping out

1436
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:30,400
Wait, da

1437
01:26:30,440 --> 01:26:32,920
I would have gone
Our friendship is stopping me!

1438
01:26:33,040 --> 01:26:34,760
I'll come back
for your sake

1439
01:26:34,840 --> 01:26:37,360
- Why are you like this?
- Haven't you left as yet?

1440
01:26:37,400 --> 01:26:38,640
Get out!

1441
01:26:38,720 --> 01:26:41,360
Changing your mind every 2nd minute
What's wrong with you?

1442
01:26:41,440 --> 01:26:44,080
- Let's discuss it inside, bro
- Are you a mad family?

1443
01:26:44,120 --> 01:26:46,960
Worse than Mad comics
I won't stay here a second longer

1444
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,200
I'll even sleep on the sidewalk

1445
01:26:49,560 --> 01:26:50,760
Country brute!

1446
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:52,040
I'm going

1447
01:26:53,320 --> 01:26:56,720
'You want to call me back
with a dead end here, I won't come'

1448
01:27:03,040 --> 01:27:04,240
It's getting late

1449
01:27:04,280 --> 01:27:06,040
Hello!
Why late?

1450
01:27:06,080 --> 01:27:08,240
5 minutes
We'll come

1451
01:27:09,080 --> 01:27:10,920
This spirit and his stupid song!

1452
01:27:11,120 --> 01:27:12,520
Only 1/2 an hour left

1453
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:13,840
Alex bro will vanish then

1454
01:27:14,040 --> 01:27:15,560
Sara hasn't turned up

1455
01:27:15,640 --> 01:27:19,520
Blame it on the devil that caught
a flight all the way to this island

1456
01:27:19,640 --> 01:27:20,840
Did you message Sara?

1457
01:27:20,880 --> 01:27:23,200
I already did, dear
But she hasn't replied

1458
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,280
Who are these men in red?

1459
01:27:26,320 --> 01:27:27,520
'They are coming towards us'

1460
01:27:27,560 --> 01:27:30,480
Akka, if they see Krishna, that's it

1461
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:32,800
- We'll be buying trouble
- Oh my God!

1462
01:27:32,840 --> 01:27:34,160
You have to handle this cleverly

1463
01:27:34,240 --> 01:27:35,280
Only you can do it

1464
01:27:35,320 --> 01:27:38,800
Now of all times, I left my karate
uniform and black belt at home!

1465
01:27:38,840 --> 01:27:40,760
Go and manage somehow, akka

1466
01:27:47,400 --> 01:27:49,320
Who are you?
Why are you here?

1467
01:27:49,400 --> 01:27:51,560
- Whom do you want to meet?
- That chap

1468
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:52,840
Which chap?

1469
01:27:54,520 --> 01:27:57,800
'That chap' means?
Tell me his name

1470
01:27:57,840 --> 01:27:59,120
Which one of the 3?

1471
01:27:59,160 --> 01:28:00,640
We see only 1 chap there

1472
01:28:01,200 --> 01:28:02,280
We want to talk to him

1473
01:28:02,320 --> 01:28:03,760
Where is he?

1474
01:28:04,720 --> 01:28:07,440
That isn't just 1 person
They are 3 in 1

1475
01:28:07,480 --> 01:28:09,080
Of the 3 men, which one?

1476
01:28:09,120 --> 01:28:10,800
- Why, madam?
- Why, man?

1477
01:28:10,840 --> 01:28:12,680
We can see only 1 fellow

1478
01:28:14,320 --> 01:28:18,280
I saw with my eyes wide open
He is '3 in 1 man'

1479
01:28:18,320 --> 01:28:20,480
How long will you repeat it
like a lunatic?

1480
01:28:21,120 --> 01:28:23,120
About half an hour

1481
01:28:23,160 --> 01:28:25,760
'Hope Ranga Reddy comes soon'

1482
01:28:25,840 --> 01:28:27,520
Whom do you want to meet?

1483
01:28:27,560 --> 01:28:29,000
That man over there

1484
01:28:29,040 --> 01:28:32,440
I'm asking you which one of the 3
Why don't you tell me?

1485
01:28:32,480 --> 01:28:33,480
Only that fellow

1486
01:28:33,520 --> 01:28:35,400
'Which one do you want to see?'

1487
01:28:35,440 --> 01:28:36,880
'Look at me'

1488
01:28:37,640 --> 01:28:39,720
- So bloody loud
- Ranga Reddy avatar!

1489
01:28:39,800 --> 01:28:42,160
- Not paying heed to my words?
- She's a royal pain!

1490
01:28:42,840 --> 01:28:45,280
You open your eyes wide
3 men are over there

1491
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:46,400
Not now
Let's go

1492
01:28:46,480 --> 01:28:48,000
Hello, madam, see you

1493
01:28:48,120 --> 01:28:49,440
It's getting late

1494
01:28:49,520 --> 01:28:50,640
See you, bro

1495
01:28:53,720 --> 01:28:56,280
Alex's girl will meet Ranga Reddy now!

1496
01:28:56,320 --> 01:28:58,320
- Hi Krish
- Don't talk to him

1497
01:28:58,480 --> 01:29:00,160
Bah! Finally got rid of them

1498
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:02,600
Hurry up

1499
01:29:02,640 --> 01:29:03,880
Akka!

1500
01:29:05,440 --> 01:29:07,480
- What's the matter?
- Nothing

1501
01:29:07,520 --> 01:29:09,600
Only we know
we are acting

1502
01:29:09,640 --> 01:29:11,120
But he is oblivious, right?

1503
01:29:11,160 --> 01:29:12,600
You came here a bit late

1504
01:29:12,640 --> 01:29:14,160
So he walked off in a huff

1505
01:29:14,480 --> 01:29:16,040
- Sorry, I got held up
- It's okay

1506
01:29:16,080 --> 01:29:17,680
I'll come early tomorrow

1507
01:29:17,720 --> 01:29:19,320
No...not tomorrow

1508
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:20,760
Sunday holiday

1509
01:29:21,120 --> 01:29:23,520
- Holiday?
- As per our contract!

1510
01:29:23,560 --> 01:29:25,400
I shoved my foot into my mouth!

1511
01:29:25,720 --> 01:29:27,280
Come on Monday

1512
01:29:27,320 --> 01:29:30,160
- Auspicious day
- Yes, let's go

1513
01:29:30,200 --> 01:29:33,280
- Come away
- 'Great escape', akka

1514
01:29:34,080 --> 01:29:36,880
[humming]

1515
01:29:38,480 --> 01:29:41,000
Akka, will Isha at least
be here on time?

1516
01:29:41,040 --> 01:29:42,560
Definitely, she should come

1517
01:29:42,600 --> 01:29:45,640
Aiyo! At least this Alex
will listen to reason

1518
01:29:45,680 --> 01:29:48,280
This Ranga Reddy is a rowdy fellow

1519
01:29:48,320 --> 01:29:52,520
If we can get rid of him first
3/4 of our job is made easier

1520
01:29:52,600 --> 01:29:54,120
Akka, she is here

1521
01:29:58,600 --> 01:30:00,000
Hello, you are looking good

1522
01:30:00,080 --> 01:30:01,600
Please take a seat

1523
01:30:04,640 --> 01:30:06,080
She is seated now

1524
01:30:06,120 --> 01:30:07,560
I would like to tell you something

1525
01:30:07,600 --> 01:30:08,640
Tell me

1526
01:30:10,120 --> 01:30:11,160
Yes, tell me

1527
01:30:11,200 --> 01:30:12,880
I've come to know
everything about you

1528
01:30:12,920 --> 01:30:14,280
Is that so?

1529
01:30:15,200 --> 01:30:17,280
I know how deep your love is

1530
01:30:20,320 --> 01:30:21,920
Life has to move on, no?

1531
01:30:24,240 --> 01:30:27,120
Profess your love fast
and make him leave soon

1532
01:30:27,280 --> 01:30:31,600
Suppose I say
I love you

1533
01:30:31,640 --> 01:30:34,000
...your mind should be
able to accept it, right?

1534
01:30:35,040 --> 01:30:37,960
I've been waiting for so long
just for this, dear

1535
01:30:44,040 --> 01:30:47,880
"Rose...rose...these flowers are for you"

1536
01:30:48,400 --> 01:30:49,480
Thank you

1537
01:30:49,520 --> 01:30:50,920
[song from 'Allari Priyudu']

1538
01:30:51,080 --> 01:30:52,080
Two timer!

1539
01:30:52,120 --> 01:30:53,640
Jinx of a jerk!

1540
01:30:53,680 --> 01:30:55,360
That bouquet wasn't for me, eh?

1541
01:30:55,400 --> 01:30:56,520
How did he land here?

1542
01:30:56,560 --> 01:30:58,880
How did this crab-mouth come here?

1543
01:30:58,920 --> 01:31:00,720
Who are you?
Come here

1544
01:31:01,200 --> 01:31:03,440
Is this why you shoved me
out of your house?

1545
01:31:03,480 --> 01:31:04,960
- Get lost!
- What is this?

1546
01:31:05,120 --> 01:31:07,640
Morning is different avatar
I am not him

1547
01:31:07,680 --> 01:31:09,320
My shift is 3 to 9!

1548
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:10,840
Darli-

1549
01:31:10,880 --> 01:31:13,040
Are you being shifty?
That too shift-wise!

1550
01:31:13,120 --> 01:31:15,520
I thought you're happy in
a big bungalow in Mauritius

1551
01:31:15,560 --> 01:31:18,080
- You have an extra accommodation?
- Mental!

1552
01:31:18,200 --> 01:31:21,280
Who are you to butt in
when I'm talking to my girl?

1553
01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:24,520
Are you her lover?
We are Tamilians, da

1554
01:31:24,560 --> 01:31:26,720
What is the Tamil culture?
Our glorious heritage?

1555
01:31:26,760 --> 01:31:29,080
Even if Devi shooed me away
she is like my sister

1556
01:31:29,160 --> 01:31:31,360
I won't let you betray her love
You clear out now

1557
01:31:31,400 --> 01:31:32,960
You are not my sister

1558
01:31:33,160 --> 01:31:34,720
What are you saying?

1559
01:31:34,760 --> 01:31:37,480
- I will kill you
- If Devi gets to know, she'll die

1560
01:31:37,520 --> 01:31:39,680
- Let's rescue him
- Hurry up

1561
01:31:39,720 --> 01:31:41,560
I'll bear his blows
You leave, madam

1562
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:44,320
Devi will die if she sees you with her

1563
01:31:44,360 --> 01:31:46,080
You get Isha, akka
I'll handle them

1564
01:31:46,120 --> 01:31:47,280
I'll tackle this, go

1565
01:31:47,360 --> 01:31:49,840
- Isha darling
- Listen to me please

1566
01:31:49,880 --> 01:31:52,760
Nothing untoward happened
I didn't see anything

1567
01:31:52,840 --> 01:31:54,080
'You trust me, right?'

1568
01:31:54,120 --> 01:31:56,360
- Isha...darling
- Sis, listen to me

1569
01:31:56,480 --> 01:31:57,960
Tomorrow is Sunday, holiday

1570
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,840
We'll set right everything
on Monday for you, sweetypie

1571
01:32:00,880 --> 01:32:02,800
I'll stay for 10 days and
straighten him out

1572
01:32:02,840 --> 01:32:04,240
Bloody blockhead!

1573
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:08,680
That girl was ready to profess
her love and you ruined it

1574
01:32:08,760 --> 01:32:10,080
Bloody buffoon!

1575
01:32:10,160 --> 01:32:11,920
Are you mad or what?

1576
01:32:11,960 --> 01:32:13,720
Setting up a mistress
for your husband?

1577
01:32:13,760 --> 01:32:16,080
- Get lost!
- Entire family lacks values, huh?

1578
01:32:16,200 --> 01:32:17,600
GET OUT!

1579
01:32:21,400 --> 01:32:22,480
Why should I go?

1580
01:32:22,520 --> 01:32:24,080
This is a beach
I'll stay right here

1581
01:32:24,120 --> 01:32:25,120
You get out!

1582
01:32:25,160 --> 01:32:26,760
Clear out, you buffalo!

1583
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:28,720
Lousy lunatic family!

1584
01:32:28,840 --> 01:32:30,120
Sir, bill

1585
01:32:36,560 --> 01:32:38,560
Do you have any job I can do?

1586
01:32:39,760 --> 01:32:41,880
Guys, Monday is our most happening show

1587
01:32:41,920 --> 01:32:43,440
Tickets are all sold out

1588
01:32:43,480 --> 01:32:45,200
Everything rests on your shoulders

1589
01:32:45,280 --> 01:32:48,720
We need to set up
a benchmark concert for Mauritius

1590
01:32:49,120 --> 01:32:50,920
- Is it okay?
- Come on, sir

1591
01:32:50,960 --> 01:32:52,600
'We are rocking'

1592
01:32:54,440 --> 01:32:55,920
[casual banter]

1593
01:32:58,120 --> 01:33:00,200
Hello...what happened?

1594
01:33:00,880 --> 01:33:01,960
Nothing

1595
01:33:02,320 --> 01:33:05,440
I told Krish's sisters
I'll see him on Monday

1596
01:33:05,640 --> 01:33:06,880
Our concert is also-

1597
01:33:06,920 --> 01:33:08,360
This isn't a big deal at all

1598
01:33:08,680 --> 01:33:11,120
Go and help him and
come straight to our venue

1599
01:33:11,200 --> 01:33:14,480
- What if I get delayed?
- I'll handle all that, chill!

1600
01:33:17,240 --> 01:33:19,520
I thought at least once a week
we can have a good time

1601
01:33:19,560 --> 01:33:21,320
I can remember
only that 1 day

1602
01:33:22,120 --> 01:33:23,680
You'll be as good as new

1603
01:33:23,720 --> 01:33:24,720
If you say so

1604
01:33:24,760 --> 01:33:26,040
Let's order something

1605
01:33:34,600 --> 01:33:36,000
Where are you going?

1606
01:33:36,920 --> 01:33:38,360
Loo...okay, go

1607
01:33:42,800 --> 01:33:43,880
Devi?

1608
01:33:43,920 --> 01:33:45,120
Vegetarian, huh?

1609
01:33:50,960 --> 01:33:52,440
Isha...Isha?

1610
01:33:52,800 --> 01:33:54,480
How come you are here?

1611
01:33:54,520 --> 01:33:55,760
What's up?

1612
01:33:55,800 --> 01:33:58,960
Krish had messaged me
That's why I came here

1613
01:34:00,840 --> 01:34:02,600
- Krish messaged you?
- Yes

1614
01:34:03,760 --> 01:34:04,880
'Why is Sara also-'

1615
01:34:04,960 --> 01:34:06,760
I must tell him I love him
That's all, right?

1616
01:34:06,800 --> 01:34:08,360
- Come with me
- Wait

1617
01:34:08,400 --> 01:34:10,200
Not today
We'll do this tomorrow

1618
01:34:10,240 --> 01:34:11,760
'Just a moment, sir
I'll be with you'

1619
01:34:11,800 --> 01:34:13,080
Okay, I'll wait

1620
01:34:15,640 --> 01:34:16,720
Hi Krish

1621
01:34:20,760 --> 01:34:22,200
Where are your sisters?

1622
01:34:23,320 --> 01:34:25,040
You messaged me
wanting to meet me

1623
01:34:25,080 --> 01:34:26,160
Sorry

1624
01:34:26,520 --> 01:34:28,360
You've mistaken me
for someone else

1625
01:34:28,440 --> 01:34:29,480
Someone else?

1626
01:34:29,520 --> 01:34:31,800
- Let's have coffee
- No, you come with me

1627
01:34:31,840 --> 01:34:35,160
Are you annoyed because
I came a bit late yesterday?

1628
01:34:37,160 --> 01:34:38,200
I know

1629
01:34:38,440 --> 01:34:40,800
- If I profess my love-
- Wait

1630
01:34:42,080 --> 01:34:43,160
I got it

1631
01:34:43,240 --> 01:34:47,360
It's natural to get attracted
especially to a young and cool chap

1632
01:34:47,400 --> 01:34:49,880
But you see I've reformed now

1633
01:34:50,720 --> 01:34:52,360
I'm married now

1634
01:34:52,560 --> 01:34:53,600
Wife, huh?

1635
01:34:55,760 --> 01:34:56,880
Are you married?

1636
01:34:56,920 --> 01:35:00,040
Why over react like this?
Isn't it a normal event for an Indian

1637
01:35:00,080 --> 01:35:01,600
She has just now gone to the loo

1638
01:35:02,800 --> 01:35:03,800
Devi

1639
01:35:06,080 --> 01:35:07,080
My wife

1640
01:35:07,120 --> 01:35:08,240
'Wife?!'

1641
01:35:08,560 --> 01:35:09,880
God's gift

1642
01:35:11,160 --> 01:35:12,920
Muah!
I love you

1643
01:35:14,120 --> 01:35:17,080
He thinks I'm someone else
and is blowing kisses!

1644
01:35:17,520 --> 01:35:19,080
Your friend?
Okay, talk to her

1645
01:35:19,120 --> 01:35:22,200
Please ignore her

1646
01:35:23,080 --> 01:35:24,600
She isn't a stranger

1647
01:35:25,320 --> 01:35:26,680
She's my sister

1648
01:35:26,920 --> 01:35:28,120
What happened?

1649
01:35:28,240 --> 01:35:29,760
Your sister?

1650
01:35:29,800 --> 01:35:31,080
Don't be broken hearted

1651
01:35:31,120 --> 01:35:32,640
You'll find a good groom for sure

1652
01:35:32,680 --> 01:35:35,840
You are a cheat! You claimed
your own husband to be your brother!

1653
01:35:35,920 --> 01:35:39,040
- Let go of my hand
- Isha, please listen to me

1654
01:35:39,120 --> 01:35:40,880
- He is...he is-
- Let me go

1655
01:35:40,920 --> 01:35:42,560
You won't understand my plight

1656
01:35:42,600 --> 01:35:44,200
'- Hear me out
- I'll call the police'

1657
01:35:44,240 --> 01:35:45,520
'I don't know how to expl-'

1658
01:35:45,600 --> 01:35:49,040
Don't walk away
Please listen to me

1659
01:35:49,240 --> 01:35:50,360
Isha?

1660
01:35:58,480 --> 01:35:59,640
Sara

1661
01:35:59,960 --> 01:36:01,480
Sara

1662
01:36:01,800 --> 01:36:04,040
He's unwell
He will recover soon

1663
01:36:04,080 --> 01:36:05,600
Sara, please hear me out

1664
01:36:05,720 --> 01:36:08,120
Sara, if you walk away too
we'll be in a real mess

1665
01:36:08,160 --> 01:36:11,520
- You call yourself a woman?
- Please hear me out, Sara

1666
01:36:11,560 --> 01:36:12,720
Sara!

1667
01:36:20,840 --> 01:36:22,760
What is our next move, dear?

1668
01:36:23,520 --> 01:36:26,640
My husband is going through hell
for 2 strangers, akka

1669
01:36:26,960 --> 01:36:28,560
It won't continue hereafter

1670
01:36:30,120 --> 01:36:32,120
My front door won't open for others!

1671
01:36:32,880 --> 01:36:34,840
How can you take this decision?

1672
01:36:34,920 --> 01:36:36,400
In this wide world

1673
01:36:37,280 --> 01:36:39,280
...if there are spirits roaming around

1674
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:41,600
God will also exist side by side

1675
01:36:42,960 --> 01:36:44,680
He will protect my decision

1676
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:27,640
[chanting]

1677
01:37:27,920 --> 01:37:29,960
[banging on door]

1678
01:37:33,760 --> 01:37:35,680
[banging continues]

1679
01:37:45,200 --> 01:37:47,640
Bro, he doesn't know anything

1680
01:37:48,440 --> 01:37:50,200
Go and search

1681
01:37:50,280 --> 01:37:51,480
Don't send them up

1682
01:37:51,520 --> 01:37:53,520
- Where is he?
- He doesn't know anything

1683
01:37:53,560 --> 01:37:55,040
Please listen to me

1684
01:37:57,920 --> 01:38:00,840
Please don't harm him, bro
He is innocent

1685
01:38:00,920 --> 01:38:02,000
Sir, no one is here

1686
01:38:02,040 --> 01:38:03,040
Listen to-

1687
01:38:04,920 --> 01:38:06,120
Where is he?

1688
01:38:06,160 --> 01:38:07,920
Where have you hidden him?

1689
01:38:32,840 --> 01:38:34,720
'He spat out...the tablet'

1690
01:38:36,240 --> 01:38:37,520
Take your hand off, man

1691
01:38:37,560 --> 01:38:39,680
I've been looking only for you

1692
01:38:39,760 --> 01:38:42,080
I told you to take your hand off!

1693
01:38:45,160 --> 01:38:46,520
What happened?

1694
01:38:47,280 --> 01:38:48,680
Devi, tell me, darling

1695
01:38:48,720 --> 01:38:49,720
Dear-

1696
01:38:49,920 --> 01:38:51,760
Who are these thugs?
Any problem?

1697
01:38:51,800 --> 01:38:52,840
Tell me, dear

1698
01:38:53,520 --> 01:38:54,640
Are you-

1699
01:38:58,800 --> 01:39:00,040
You are good with your fist?

1700
01:39:00,080 --> 01:39:02,800
Any husband will retaliate
if his wife is being manhandled

1701
01:39:02,840 --> 01:39:04,800
Are you both enacting a drama?

1702
01:39:15,800 --> 01:39:16,920
'Listen, dear'

1703
01:39:44,080 --> 01:39:46,080
Don't, dear

1704
01:39:46,200 --> 01:39:47,400
'Let him go'

1705
01:39:51,200 --> 01:39:52,440
Wait, dear

1706
01:40:02,080 --> 01:40:03,120
Hey!

1707
01:40:05,320 --> 01:40:06,440
Oh God!

1708
01:40:07,680 --> 01:40:09,040
You're bleeding, man

1709
01:40:09,480 --> 01:40:11,360
- What problem?
- Problem, huh?

1710
01:40:17,640 --> 01:40:20,600
'How many times to repeat
we don't know anything'

1711
01:40:20,640 --> 01:40:22,560
'Why have you brought us here?'

1712
01:40:22,640 --> 01:40:24,680
'Let us go
Listen to me'

1713
01:40:24,760 --> 01:40:26,040
'Try and understand'

1714
01:40:28,080 --> 01:40:31,040
'Husband and wife, hand in glove?
What are you scheming?'

1715
01:40:31,080 --> 01:40:33,080
We have no clue
about any plan

1716
01:40:35,640 --> 01:40:37,160
Please let us go

1717
01:40:37,200 --> 01:40:40,800
'If you don't have any plan
why are you hounding Sara and Isha?'

1718
01:40:49,880 --> 01:40:52,240
- Monetary gains, huh?
- Money?

1719
01:40:53,840 --> 01:40:56,480
If you lure Sara and Isha
into your web and marry them

1720
01:40:56,520 --> 01:40:59,560
Wealth around 2 billion
Multiple immovable properties

1721
01:40:59,600 --> 01:41:02,480
You've lined your nest
for the next 10 generations

1722
01:41:03,160 --> 01:41:04,320
Bloody fool

1723
01:41:04,880 --> 01:41:06,800
This has been my carefully executed plan

1724
01:41:06,840 --> 01:41:08,520
Who the hell are you to butt in?

1725
01:41:08,560 --> 01:41:10,960
We don't know anything about this

1726
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,360
Expect me to buy that?
What about what I saw?

1727
01:41:14,400 --> 01:41:17,680
1st you went behind Sara
and I thought I'll warn you

1728
01:41:17,720 --> 01:41:19,320
Then you switched over to Isha!

1729
01:41:22,120 --> 01:41:24,400
After I realized you are a fraud

1730
01:41:24,440 --> 01:41:27,800
I sent a message to Sara and Isha
as if you texted them

1731
01:41:27,880 --> 01:41:32,320
'I asked both of them to come to
the same venue, same time to meet you'

1732
01:41:47,360 --> 01:41:49,720
I swear this is the truth
That wasn't us

1733
01:41:50,880 --> 01:41:52,840
What do you mean
'That wasn't us'?

1734
01:41:54,160 --> 01:41:55,320
Who else then?

1735
01:41:57,640 --> 01:41:59,000
That's a contract!

1736
01:42:00,440 --> 01:42:01,920
I can't discuss it with you

1737
01:42:01,960 --> 01:42:03,520
What temerity!

1738
01:42:04,720 --> 01:42:05,880
Contract, huh?

1739
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,320
Then who is behind all this?

1740
01:42:09,880 --> 01:42:10,880
No one else, sir

1741
01:42:10,920 --> 01:42:12,640
You won't understand even if I explain

1742
01:42:12,680 --> 01:42:14,120
Who is your boss?

1743
01:42:15,200 --> 01:42:16,240
Come on, tell me

1744
01:42:17,040 --> 01:42:18,680
[phone ringing]

1745
01:42:21,280 --> 01:42:22,520
Hi Sara

1746
01:42:24,160 --> 01:42:25,560
Yeah, I'll be there

1747
01:42:25,600 --> 01:42:26,680
Okay

1748
01:42:27,240 --> 01:42:28,280
Sara

1749
01:42:28,320 --> 01:42:29,440
All set

1750
01:42:29,480 --> 01:42:30,640
You leave now, sir

1751
01:42:30,680 --> 01:42:32,160
You'll be late for the concert

1752
01:42:32,400 --> 01:42:33,720
I'll handle them

1753
01:42:33,800 --> 01:42:34,920
Dai

1754
01:42:35,240 --> 01:42:38,000
Don't be rash, the way
you killed Alex and Ranga

1755
01:42:42,240 --> 01:42:44,440
Their story seems more complicated

1756
01:42:45,560 --> 01:42:48,440
After extracting all the information
about who is the kingpin

1757
01:42:48,480 --> 01:42:50,000
Then close their chapter

1758
01:42:50,640 --> 01:42:51,720
Okay

1759
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:25,840
Hey! Tell me now

1760
01:43:26,080 --> 01:43:27,280
Who sent you here?

1761
01:43:28,280 --> 01:43:29,440
'What is your plan?'

1762
01:43:29,480 --> 01:43:31,840
'Cat got your tongue?'

1763
01:43:31,920 --> 01:43:34,440
'Who the hell is behind all this?'

1764
01:43:37,200 --> 01:43:39,040
Will you talk now or not?

1765
01:43:52,480 --> 01:43:54,360
You killed me, da

1766
01:43:55,080 --> 01:43:58,080
You made sure
I can't marry Isha, right?

1767
01:43:58,920 --> 01:44:00,480
WHY DID YOU?

1768
01:44:03,280 --> 01:44:04,440
Why?

1769
01:44:05,640 --> 01:44:06,960
How am I to blame?

1770
01:44:08,560 --> 01:44:10,960
I just loved Sara

1771
01:44:14,480 --> 01:44:16,120
'You scumbag!'

1772
01:45:07,320 --> 01:45:09,360
[clamor of voices]

1773
01:45:10,280 --> 01:45:12,120
Alright...okay

1774
01:45:16,240 --> 01:45:17,600
Where are you going?

1775
01:45:17,640 --> 01:45:19,240
I have to kill him

1776
01:45:19,280 --> 01:45:21,040
I'll kill him come what may

1777
01:45:21,480 --> 01:45:22,440
You cannot kill him

1778
01:45:22,480 --> 01:45:23,800
I won't agree

1779
01:45:24,840 --> 01:45:25,840
Sara

1780
01:45:26,360 --> 01:45:27,560
Poor girl!

1781
01:45:28,040 --> 01:45:31,760
If I don't kill him
he will ruin her entire life

1782
01:45:32,200 --> 01:45:34,680
Because of him
should my life be ruined?

1783
01:45:34,720 --> 01:45:37,200
Whatever the reason
I can't accept this

1784
01:45:37,760 --> 01:45:39,960
You are thinking
only about yourself, right?

1785
01:45:40,360 --> 01:45:41,920
YES OR NO?

1786
01:45:42,160 --> 01:45:43,640
You'll easily kill him

1787
01:45:43,680 --> 01:45:45,560
But the blame
will fall on my husband

1788
01:45:45,600 --> 01:45:48,120
YOU HAVE NO CONSCIENCE WHATSOEVER!

1789
01:45:54,480 --> 01:45:56,240
You are too selfish

1790
01:45:57,400 --> 01:45:59,720
Yeah, selfish

1791
01:46:00,720 --> 01:46:03,840
Please don't kill him
Don't do anything drastic

1792
01:46:03,920 --> 01:46:05,600
Please, let go of my husband

1793
01:46:05,640 --> 01:46:06,720
GO!

1794
01:46:08,440 --> 01:46:11,520
Hey, you there!
I am coming

1795
01:46:19,760 --> 01:46:20,920
'Please wait'

1796
01:46:26,560 --> 01:46:29,320
Listen to me please
Don't do this

1797
01:46:31,240 --> 01:46:33,080
Spare him

1798
01:46:34,360 --> 01:46:36,360
Please listen to me

1799
01:47:17,480 --> 01:47:20,160
If I see her shed
even a single teardrop-

1800
01:47:46,080 --> 01:47:47,120
Excuse me

1801
01:47:47,160 --> 01:47:48,560
Sara, you're getting ready?

1802
01:47:48,600 --> 01:47:50,200
Oh! You have come?

1803
01:47:50,440 --> 01:47:52,280
Can I talk to you
for a minute?

1804
01:47:52,480 --> 01:47:53,480
Yeah, sure

1805
01:47:53,920 --> 01:47:55,240
Who is it, dad?

1806
01:47:56,960 --> 01:47:58,320
Why did you come here?

1807
01:47:59,960 --> 01:48:01,960
How many more lies
will you concoct?

1808
01:48:12,360 --> 01:48:16,200
You were very disturbed
after Alex died in that accident

1809
01:48:17,400 --> 01:48:18,920
I know Alex was a good friend

1810
01:48:18,960 --> 01:48:21,160
Very important member in our band

1811
01:48:21,640 --> 01:48:25,120
That's why I kept
my feelings bottled up

1812
01:48:25,160 --> 01:48:27,880
Cha! How stupid of me
to try and help you

1813
01:48:28,440 --> 01:48:31,160
But that help never reached us

1814
01:48:31,720 --> 01:48:32,800
Sara

1815
01:48:32,840 --> 01:48:34,600
Actually I am in love with you

1816
01:48:34,640 --> 01:48:36,440
I want to marry you

1817
01:48:39,720 --> 01:48:40,720
Hey!

1818
01:48:41,360 --> 01:48:42,600
What do you mean?

1819
01:48:42,680 --> 01:48:44,200
Please leave now

1820
01:48:44,240 --> 01:48:46,520
I've had enough of
believing all your stories!

1821
01:48:47,280 --> 01:48:50,400
Rudra, I didn't know that
you have these feelings for me

1822
01:48:51,120 --> 01:48:52,240
I think-

1823
01:48:53,360 --> 01:48:55,080
We are good friends

1824
01:48:55,800 --> 01:48:57,440
It's better we stay that way

1825
01:48:57,720 --> 01:49:00,000
Why shouldn't friends fall in love?

1826
01:49:01,480 --> 01:49:03,480
Yes, they can

1827
01:49:03,640 --> 01:49:04,920
I'll go, dear

1828
01:49:05,120 --> 01:49:06,840
But for my sake, just once

1829
01:49:06,880 --> 01:49:09,120
Profess your love to Krish

1830
01:49:09,160 --> 01:49:14,560
Without your own knowledge
your words will save a girl's life

1831
01:49:14,640 --> 01:49:17,480
I want you to understand too
A man loved me deeply

1832
01:49:17,520 --> 01:49:20,320
When I started reciprocating
and wanted to express it to him

1833
01:49:20,360 --> 01:49:21,800
...he died in an accident

1834
01:49:21,840 --> 01:49:22,840
Who?

1835
01:49:29,920 --> 01:49:32,560
Only recently
I realized I love him

1836
01:49:32,600 --> 01:49:35,560
Because I didn't want Krish
to go through what I did

1837
01:49:35,600 --> 01:49:37,120
I agreed to help you

1838
01:49:37,440 --> 01:49:38,760
Carbon copy of him

1839
01:49:38,800 --> 01:49:40,360
In the way he talks and moves

1840
01:49:41,040 --> 01:49:42,280
Everything is ditto

1841
01:49:45,840 --> 01:49:47,360
Don't you get what I'm saying?

1842
01:49:47,400 --> 01:49:48,640
I love Ranga Reddy

1843
01:49:48,720 --> 01:49:50,040
I still love him

1844
01:50:10,520 --> 01:50:12,200
Only then it dawned on me

1845
01:50:12,360 --> 01:50:15,120
That the man I love isn't him

1846
01:50:16,440 --> 01:50:17,440
Alex

1847
01:50:20,840 --> 01:50:23,160
I couldn't tell him when he was alive

1848
01:50:24,120 --> 01:50:26,160
Now I feel like saying it
1000 times over

1849
01:50:28,800 --> 01:50:30,080
I loved Alex

1850
01:50:32,360 --> 01:50:34,000
And I still love Alex

1851
01:50:40,680 --> 01:50:41,720
Are you out of your mind?

1852
01:50:41,760 --> 01:50:43,520
How can the dead come back alive?

1853
01:50:45,360 --> 01:50:47,120
And will you waste your life like this?

1854
01:50:47,160 --> 01:50:48,600
You have to move on

1855
01:51:01,360 --> 01:51:03,120
'How did I come here?'

1856
01:51:09,240 --> 01:51:10,760
'What is this place?'

1857
01:51:16,440 --> 01:51:18,440
Can't you see how much I love you?

1858
01:51:18,480 --> 01:51:21,040
I'm your friend too
Why can't you love me?

1859
01:51:23,440 --> 01:51:24,440
Hey!

1860
01:51:27,040 --> 01:51:28,400
'Why is he here?'

1861
01:51:31,880 --> 01:51:34,160
'Has he come back
thinking she is Ruby?'

1862
01:51:34,200 --> 01:51:35,800
What did you do?

1863
01:51:38,040 --> 01:51:40,440
No, that's my wife Devi, sir

1864
01:51:40,480 --> 01:51:42,560
Rudra, love can't be forced!

1865
01:51:42,840 --> 01:51:43,840
Sara

1866
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:46,800
What are you doing?
Let go of me

1867
01:51:46,840 --> 01:51:49,200
You have to understand, Sara, please

1868
01:51:50,640 --> 01:51:52,040
Rudra, you're crossing your limits

1869
01:51:52,080 --> 01:51:53,200
Sara, you are mine

1870
01:51:53,240 --> 01:51:54,720
- Let me go
- You're mine, Sara

1871
01:51:54,760 --> 01:51:55,840
Let go

1872
01:51:56,800 --> 01:51:58,360
Sara...wait

1873
01:51:59,640 --> 01:52:00,840
Help me

1874
01:52:01,080 --> 01:52:02,920
Akka, help me
Save me

1875
01:52:02,960 --> 01:52:04,720
- What?
- You?

1876
01:52:04,760 --> 01:52:06,120
Brother, it's me

1877
01:52:06,640 --> 01:52:08,240
He's trying to shoot me

1878
01:52:08,280 --> 01:52:10,000
- Sir?
- Move

1879
01:52:10,440 --> 01:52:11,600
Sir...?

1880
01:52:11,840 --> 01:52:13,320
Why do you want to kill him?

1881
01:52:13,360 --> 01:52:15,480
My repeated warnings fell on deaf ears

1882
01:52:16,760 --> 01:52:18,760
So he takes instructions from you?

1883
01:52:20,120 --> 01:52:21,960
He didn't pay heed
to my warnings

1884
01:52:24,480 --> 01:52:25,800
I will kill him

1885
01:52:26,240 --> 01:52:27,520
Hey! Out

1886
01:52:27,560 --> 01:52:28,560
No

1887
01:52:28,760 --> 01:52:30,640
I should be the one to kill him

1888
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:33,000
Why?

1889
01:52:35,560 --> 01:52:37,160
What's happening here?

1890
01:52:37,600 --> 01:52:38,800
Wait, I say

1891
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:50,600
[crowd cheering]

1892
01:52:55,320 --> 01:52:56,640
Raj Khanna!

1893
01:52:58,240 --> 01:53:00,160
'Raj Khanna?!'

1894
01:53:02,640 --> 01:53:04,400
[overlap of eager voices]

1895
01:53:04,440 --> 01:53:06,560
'Do you remember once
in your house, Devi-'

1896
01:53:06,600 --> 01:53:09,240
'Just 1 photo
He's my friend, I say'

1897
01:53:09,280 --> 01:53:11,920
'Raj Khanna...Raj Khanna'

1898
01:53:12,080 --> 01:53:13,240
'Move, man'

1899
01:53:13,320 --> 01:53:15,920
'Let me take a selfie with your gun'

1900
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,160
Revolver Raja?!

1901
01:53:18,240 --> 01:53:20,800
Just 1 selfie with your gun

1902
01:53:20,880 --> 01:53:23,360
Don't lift your hand

1903
01:53:23,440 --> 01:53:24,840
[gunshot]

1904
01:53:49,680 --> 01:53:50,960
You shot him?

1905
01:53:51,880 --> 01:53:53,520
Shooting

1906
01:53:55,400 --> 01:53:58,240
Raj Khanna...my leader!

1907
01:53:58,280 --> 01:54:00,080
I love you

1908
01:54:00,120 --> 01:54:02,920
Soooper shooting!

1909
01:54:02,960 --> 01:54:04,440
I watched a shoot

1910
01:54:07,200 --> 01:54:08,760
Rock star...Rock star
Super Rock star

1911
01:54:08,800 --> 01:54:10,560
It's over
Get up

1912
01:54:10,640 --> 01:54:11,960
Rock star

1913
01:54:15,200 --> 01:54:16,840
MURDER!!

1914
01:54:18,680 --> 01:54:19,680
Devi?

1915
01:54:19,840 --> 01:54:21,440
'He's still breathing
Give me a hand'

1916
01:54:21,480 --> 01:54:23,680
'Hospital...ambulance...call 108'

1917
01:54:23,760 --> 01:54:25,400
'Come...lift him up'

1918
01:54:36,520 --> 01:54:37,560
Krish...na?

1919
01:54:37,600 --> 01:54:38,880
What happened, dear?

1920
01:54:39,800 --> 01:54:41,120
Why are we here?

1921
01:54:43,320 --> 01:54:44,680
Is there any problem?

1922
01:54:46,200 --> 01:54:48,560
Tell me, Devi

1923
01:55:02,480 --> 01:55:04,800
- I'm fine
- You aren't hurt, are you?

1924
01:55:27,120 --> 01:55:28,440
'What's wrong with him?'

1925
01:55:29,720 --> 01:55:31,800
Why is he getting so emotional?

1926
01:55:47,560 --> 01:55:49,560
- Ganesha?
- Bro?

1927
01:55:49,600 --> 01:55:50,760
Hey! Ganesha

1928
01:55:50,800 --> 01:55:52,520
- Come home, da
- Come home, anna

1929
01:55:52,600 --> 01:55:54,560
- Ganesha
- Come on

1930
01:55:55,240 --> 01:55:57,680
- Stay for at least 10 days, bro
- Mad family!

1931
01:56:00,200 --> 01:56:01,240
Loony bin family!

1932
01:56:01,280 --> 01:56:03,840
Try coming to our hometown
I'll curse you

1933
01:56:04,640 --> 01:56:06,680
Why is he behaving strange-

1934
01:56:06,880 --> 01:56:09,040
Why isn't she letting me speak?

1935
01:56:10,360 --> 01:56:12,520
1st let us go home
and have a cosy dinner

1936
01:56:12,600 --> 01:56:14,600
Then I'll feast on you for my desser-

1937
01:56:16,600 --> 01:56:21,160
That girl won't profess her love to Krish
She loves only Ranga Reddy it seems

1938
01:56:21,200 --> 01:56:23,800
- I don't know what to do
- 'That's why spirits left him'

1939
01:56:23,840 --> 01:56:25,400
Shall we just cajole that spirit?

1940
01:56:25,480 --> 01:56:27,280
My dear boy!

1941
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:31,480
Didn't I tell you this 'roti' face
is a bad influence on you?

1942
01:56:31,520 --> 01:56:32,520
Come here

1943
01:56:33,880 --> 01:56:36,840
Why has she joined with the spirits?

1944
01:56:38,240 --> 01:56:41,440
'He has survived the gunshot
but lost his memory'

1945
01:56:41,520 --> 01:56:43,240
We'll try and see how to recover him

1946
01:56:43,280 --> 01:56:44,480
God is great

1947
01:56:44,520 --> 01:56:47,480
subtitled by rekhs
assisted by harini

1948
01:56:47,560 --> 01:56:51,400
'Thank God! He is oblivious of
having been possessed by 2 spirits'

1949
01:56:53,600 --> 01:56:54,720
'Thank my lucky stars!'

1950
01:56:54,760 --> 01:56:57,240
'I was petrified she may be
possessed by Ruby again'

1951
01:56:57,280 --> 01:56:59,680
Please proceed towards Gate # 3
