1
00:02:11,764 --> 00:02:15,097
You're going to die, you
have just two months.

2
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:21,130
Don't waste any more money, the
family will need it... Take him away.

3
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:23,669
Doctor, you shouldn't say that.

4
00:02:23,776 --> 00:02:25,107
So who should? The ward boy?

5
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:27,102
I'm the doctor, I know it all.

6
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:29,579
But sir, there must be some hope?

7
00:02:29,682 --> 00:02:30,706
There's no hope.

8
00:02:31,217 --> 00:02:32,275
It's the last stage.

9
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:36,122
No treatment will help

10
00:02:36,222 --> 00:02:37,246
If you want to waste money

11
00:02:37,423 --> 00:02:39,186
Try a private hospital

12
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:41,157
We're short on beds here.

13
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:45,395
Sir you could have said the
same thing... with love

14
00:02:45,732 --> 00:02:48,132
I'm here to treat them
not to love them.

15
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,299
But Sir, one should be
a little emotional?

16
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,271
Emotions make you weak

17
00:02:56,809 --> 00:02:59,175
But your attitude
isn't right either

18
00:03:00,747 --> 00:03:01,771
It's not?

19
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:02,837
Come.

20
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:07,244
You see how long this line is?

21
00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:09,313
They're all waiting for me

22
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:15,150
If I was busy being emotional,
Even those with hope, would die

23
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:20,189
Instead of giving false hope
to those who are dying

24
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:22,632
It's better to save those
who can be saved.

25
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,692
It's Thursday, shouldn't
we be eating okra?

26
00:03:47,427 --> 00:03:48,485
It wasn't available.

27
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:51,354
Ok.

28
00:03:56,502 --> 00:03:57,526
Where are you off to?

29
00:03:58,371 --> 00:04:00,202
Study group
- at a friend's place

30
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:05,507
Study groups-chatting
and laughing all night!

31
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:08,607
Like we don't know anything.

32
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:12,642
This is not a group apple.

33
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:15,378
This one's for your friends

34
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:20,751
He even catches the apple
like it's a cricket ball.

35
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:23,319
You can go. Go to sleep.

36
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,528
Thank you. Good night.

37
00:05:03,102 --> 00:05:04,091
Where are you going?

38
00:05:08,741 --> 00:05:09,765
Why?

39
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,538
What do you mean why? I have a job...

40
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:13,403
I've got to go.

41
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:14,603
For how long?

42
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,306
I'll be back in a week. I promise.

43
00:05:19,352 --> 00:05:20,410
Will you miss me?

44
00:05:21,587 --> 00:05:22,611
No.

45
00:05:22,855 --> 00:05:24,322
What no!? Say yes...

46
00:05:24,757 --> 00:05:25,781
Say yes, yes...

47
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,330
People say life's a game.

48
00:05:41,874 --> 00:05:43,535
I say the game itself is life.

49
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,744
From the sadness of losing
to the sheerjoy of winning

50
00:05:47,613 --> 00:05:49,342
Life is what lies in between.

51
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:51,673
Well said. - Oops, I spouted
something profound!

52
00:05:51,784 --> 00:05:53,308
Never mind.

53
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:56,320
It means a lot to me to have
you on my show today.

54
00:05:56,489 --> 00:05:57,649
Thank you very much.

55
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:58,914
Thank you.

56
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:00,519
There you are ladies and gentlemen,

57
00:06:00,626 --> 00:06:02,457
The one and only, Chinaman.

58
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:06,358
He was awesome in his time,
what an amazing bowler.

59
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:07,757
He was one of my favorites.

60
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:10,660
I have only one favorite Kapil Dev...

61
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:14,807
He just had to flick his collar
up, and the wicket would fall

62
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:17,434
Do you know who my favorite is?

63
00:06:17,577 --> 00:06:18,601
Who?

64
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:19,769
Tendulkar

65
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:24,373
I don't know what
he keeps adjusting!

66
00:06:25,518 --> 00:06:27,418
For me it's neither Shahrukh
nor Salman...

67
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:29,350
Only lmran.

68
00:06:29,922 --> 00:06:30,946
I've met him

69
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,388
No way! - Really?

70
00:06:32,825 --> 00:06:33,849
What's the big deal?

71
00:06:33,993 --> 00:06:35,688
You've met lmran and you're
saying what's the big deal...

72
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:36,819
What are you saying dude?

73
00:06:36,929 --> 00:06:39,363
While you guys spend hours
in buses and tubes,

74
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:42,432
I, as an lmmigration officer,
have to meet everyone!

75
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:48,366
Without my approval not a pin
gets in... and not even lmran!

76
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:50,738
You must have pictures...
show us some pictures...

77
00:06:50,877 --> 00:06:54,540
Look, I meet him as a friend,
not some photo-hungry fan

78
00:06:55,014 --> 00:06:56,743
He may be lm-ran, but
I'm lm-portant too.

79
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:02,547
Let's have another round.

80
00:07:02,688 --> 00:07:03,712
Let's order.

81
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:05,551
Don't ask him, he's one of us.

82
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:07,518
Call the white guy-

83
00:07:08,995 --> 00:07:12,396
I like ordering Brits around
in London; it gives me a high

84
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:14,657
I'd love to order something
every few minutes.

85
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:16,594
Ay-crikey

86
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:18,594
Sorry sir

87
00:07:18,704 --> 00:07:19,728
Second round

88
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:21,063
I beg your pardon?

89
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,672
Don't look. Come here.
Second round.

90
00:07:27,013 --> 00:07:30,813
It really gets their goat
when you call them crikey.

91
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:36,911
Mr. Hemendra Harshad Bhai Patel...
your next question

92
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,429
In the UK if you are
a witness to a crime

93
00:07:44,063 --> 00:07:47,464
which number other than 999
can you call for the police?

94
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:52,732
Option A: 1000

95
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:56,532
Option B: 1100

96
00:07:57,777 --> 00:07:59,972
Option C: 112

97
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,846
Option D: 111?

98
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:10,613
Option C

99
00:08:12,091 --> 00:08:13,388
Right answer! And with that,

100
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,859
you are awarded citizenship
to the United Kingdom

101
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:22,463
And he scores!

102
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,498
Who are you calling?

103
00:08:30,643 --> 00:08:32,008
I'm "calling a friend" like
on the quiz show...

104
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:33,570
No, I'm calling my older brother-

105
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:35,638
I should share the good news.

106
00:08:35,815 --> 00:08:38,010
You just have my approval
and you're calling people

107
00:08:38,117 --> 00:08:39,982
If they approve you, you'll be
shouting it from the rooftops.

108
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:44,117
Is that Jignesh? It's Hemu...

109
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:45,922
I'm his brother, from London

110
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:48,684
He's not home?

111
00:08:49,795 --> 00:08:51,490
It's amazing, he's never home...

112
00:08:51,664 --> 00:08:53,495
I wonder where his kids came from!

113
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:58,500
I tried his cell phone
but there's no answer.

114
00:08:59,071 --> 00:09:04,839
Yes. Ok, tell him I'm about
to get my UK residence permit

115
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,536
And then I'm coming to India

116
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:11,076
What do you mean why? It's
mom's 60th birthday

117
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:13,050
We'll all celebrate together

118
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:16,522
Yes, please let Jignesh know

119
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:18,649
May god be with you...

120
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:26,462
Hemu have you lost your
mind? You're getting

121
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,659
your UK citizenship but making
plans to live in India?

122
00:09:30,102 --> 00:09:31,569
Don't mess up my game

123
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,699
It's taken me 14 years to get here...

124
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:37,733
Now we'll go to India
whenever we want...

125
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,571
To our people

126
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:43,674
Whether they want us or not

127
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:46,812
What did she say?

128
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:48,645
It's ok

129
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:51,587
Your people! Who haven't
come on the line in 2 years

130
00:09:52,224 --> 00:09:54,556
They hang up when
they see your number

131
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:56,126
Forget it dad, it's
not gonna happen.

132
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:00,999
They are my people, my family...

133
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,599
how can they forget me?

134
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:04,159
You know them...

135
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:07,129
When you come with me you'll see

136
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:09,665
Nothing is going to happen.

137
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:10,833
You're living in a piped dream dad.

138
00:10:12,678 --> 00:10:17,741
Fine... fine... I love
to live in pipe.

139
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:35,598
Look, he's at it again.

140
00:10:36,202 --> 00:10:39,603
If you're not white, they
practically strip you.

141
00:10:40,706 --> 00:10:44,164
It's like they're measuring
you for your wedding suit

142
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:48,669
What can you do? Everyone pays
for the misdeeds of a few.

143
00:10:48,781 --> 00:10:49,873
Not at all. It's all about
the colour of your skin.

144
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:56,088
Let have a bet. 5 pounds says
that boy there, he's in for it.

145
00:10:56,188 --> 00:10:57,780
Who?
- The guy in the brown coat.

146
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:03,183
He looks like a geek but
they'll search him

147
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,626
like he's the godfather

148
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:10,893
See... They stripped him didn't
they. Gimme my 5 quid

149
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:14,666
Are you gujarati? From which
city? Ahmedabad? Baroda?

150
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:26,743
Why did you lie?

151
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:28,977
If I'd spoken in Gujarati he
would've come home for lunch

152
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:30,747
And tomorrow he'd tell everyone:

153
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:32,687
Hemu Patel is a janitor
at the airport

154
00:11:33,225 --> 00:11:35,250
Anyway, don't change the subject,
Gimme my 5 quid.

155
00:14:19,325 --> 00:14:21,816
Why have you brought me here? You
know I don't like Chinese food.

156
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:24,188
Just eat it... one meal
won't kill you.

157
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:26,923
Come...

158
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,164
Come, come and sit.

159
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,006
Namaste... I'm Sarabjeet.

160
00:14:42,248 --> 00:14:43,909
This is my mom, my dad...

161
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:45,442
Mom, dad, this is Kashmira

162
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:51,420
Listen, we have decided that
we're getting married.

163
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,026
The rituals and stuff
are for the parents...

164
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,184
So you guys discuss
it among yourselves

165
00:14:58,264 --> 00:14:59,925
There's no need to get flustered...

166
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:01,123
The world is changing...

167
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:02,962
Mom dad mom dad

168
00:15:06,105 --> 00:15:08,869
I think we should leave
these guys alone.

169
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:12,334
We're off... we're
going for a drive

170
00:15:12,511 --> 00:15:13,910
Go ahead and discuss stuff
in the meantime...

171
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,819
I guess it's no point inquiring
about the "girl's"

172
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:25,413
Educational background or
home-making capabilities...

173
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:28,051
Or, for that matter, about
our son's income...

174
00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:29,990
We've just got to decide
the menu and the venue...

175
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:33,030
Absolutely if we knew your names,

176
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:34,156
We would've had the
invitations ready...

177
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,101
The bowler prepares,

178
00:15:49,214 --> 00:15:51,910
The batsman is ready...
his forehead moist

179
00:16:03,262 --> 00:16:05,025
And it's the first ball of the over

180
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:30,288
Forget this... the next match
depends on Tendulkar

181
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:31,947
And yourjobs depend on me.

182
00:16:35,527 --> 00:16:36,994
This is your first and last warning.

183
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:39,087
Sir... cricket... cricket...

184
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:40,222
What do you mean,
"cricket cricket?"

185
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:42,197
The cricketer David Abraham
has been admitted

186
00:16:42,634 --> 00:16:44,966
There are no VIPs and
no cricketers here...

187
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:46,094
They are all patients

188
00:17:09,561 --> 00:17:11,222
This is India's tumour

189
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,534
Check for Creatinine, B.U.N.

190
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:18,503
and do a Urine culture

191
00:17:24,676 --> 00:17:26,041
It's itching buddy

192
00:17:26,178 --> 00:17:27,202
I see that

193
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,108
Who is that?

194
00:17:32,317 --> 00:17:34,148
Dr. Satyajeet.
He'll be treating you.

195
00:17:34,686 --> 00:17:36,017
Is he a good doctor

196
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:37,446
One of the best

197
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,115
A good person?

198
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:40,649
No comment.

199
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,888
If he's a good doctor he
must be a good person

200
00:17:57,543 --> 00:17:59,033
Hi -Hi

201
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:01,041
You've lost faith
in the Indian team?

202
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,605
Not till the day I die.

203
00:18:04,149 --> 00:18:07,050
But I've got to win the
trust of people here...

204
00:18:07,352 --> 00:18:08,376
What do you mean?

205
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:11,717
I got the call. Tomorrow is my
final citizenship interview.

206
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,149
Ok
- Yeah

207
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:16,056
You'll see, that Brit will be
speaking Gujarati soon...

208
00:18:16,161 --> 00:18:17,185
He'll call me Hemu bhai

209
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:20,122
But why are you
changing the posters?

210
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,432
Don't you get it? If they
do a surprise check

211
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:26,060
They should feel they are not
Indians. They're like us.

212
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:27,429
Then they'll accept us right away.

213
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,237
But why do we have
to put on a show?

214
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:32,070
What's wrong with us as we are?

215
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,012
If you attach a peacock's
feather onto a crow,

216
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,172
He won't become a peacock.

217
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:38,078
I'm not stupid, ok?

218
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:39,341
I'm not stupid.

219
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:41,252
In Rome do as the Romans...

220
00:18:42,754 --> 00:18:45,279
Hence, Mother India goes out

221
00:18:45,691 --> 00:18:47,556
Mama Elizabeth comes in.

222
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:50,090
You just wait and watch mom...

223
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:52,186
The dhokla is off to
become a burger

224
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,258
Next he'll change his name

225
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:57,395
From Hemu Patel to Harry Potter

226
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:58,660
Shut up

227
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:00,101
Shut up you stupid idiot!

228
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:03,606
I'm doing all this for you!

229
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,374
Not bad.

230
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,586
Your reports have improved.

231
00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:18,416
Concentrate on mathematics

232
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,217
The vegetable vendors have
baby gourds these days

233
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:24,393
So replace Tuesday's gherkins
with baby gourds

234
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:30,658
How is the patient who
had mouth cancer?

235
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:34,068
Dead. We'd done a tracheotomy-

236
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,232
he was smoking cigarettes
through it. He died.

237
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:38,734
And the one who drank
the pesticide?

238
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,169
He's alive. He survived...

239
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,142
so now he's shamelessly
drinking orange juice

240
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:47,685
Another guy's come in,
some cricketer

241
00:19:48,554 --> 00:19:49,578
What's his problem?

242
00:19:49,721 --> 00:19:52,155
Cricket... the same disease
the entire nation's got.

243
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:54,649
Who is it?

244
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,593
Some David Abraham

245
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:59,289
David Abraham?
He's an awesome bowler.

246
00:19:59,464 --> 00:20:02,160
He was. Now he's a patient.

247
00:20:13,845 --> 00:20:15,312
What's up Ganesh?

248
00:20:15,747 --> 00:20:19,183
One's better than the next...
but they're all nurses.

249
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:22,110
You'd better become
a bit more holy

250
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,314
or drop that religious
first name you've got!

251
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:27,384
Sir, one has to keep
up the net practice

252
00:20:27,492 --> 00:20:30,290
Ok... but help me as well...

253
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:33,289
In your condition

254
00:20:33,665 --> 00:20:37,226
Don't look at my condition look
at the thirst in my eyes...

255
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:40,795
Somewhere, in some corner of
this hospital there has to be

256
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:42,203
A televion! I'm tired of looking.

257
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:44,638
A T.V.? I thought you wanted...

258
00:20:44,776 --> 00:20:47,677
Absolutely... once I'm well.

259
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,441
But right now I have to
watch the world cup.

260
00:20:49,848 --> 00:20:53,340
I don't understand how you guys
survive without cricket

261
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:56,577
We survive. We have to think
about the end of the month...

262
00:20:56,788 --> 00:20:59,450
You're talking about the
end of the month...

263
00:20:59,891 --> 00:21:03,418
I'm at the end of my days... do
something brother, anything.

264
00:21:03,795 --> 00:21:07,253
Sir if I get into all this
I'll end up on the streets

265
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:11,592
Don't worry we'll do it together...

266
00:21:11,703 --> 00:21:13,227
Nobody will figure it out

267
00:21:16,675 --> 00:21:18,575
We're dead. It's figured out.

268
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:20,336
Namaste sir.

269
00:21:22,314 --> 00:21:25,249
Doctor, it's you... I was
just looking for you.

270
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:28,280
In the garden? I'm the
doctor not the gardener.

271
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:29,678
What's the difference?

272
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,383
A doctor breathes life into humans

273
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:34,819
A gardener breathes
life into plants.

274
00:21:35,761 --> 00:21:39,253
And if the plant grows unruly,
the gardener prunes it.

275
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:46,294
If this plant gets a television,
it won't grow wild...

276
00:21:46,571 --> 00:21:49,267
The world cup has started.
I have to watch the match.

277
00:21:49,841 --> 00:21:51,331
There's a pad hanging on your bed...

278
00:21:51,777 --> 00:21:53,210
When the hemoglobin and blood
pressure levels match

279
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:55,746
Normal levels, you can go
home and watch the match

280
00:21:55,914 --> 00:21:59,475
How do I explain? Just like
treating me is essential to you

281
00:21:59,751 --> 00:22:00,843
Cricket is essential to me

282
00:22:01,386 --> 00:22:03,445
All you will get here
is your treatment

283
00:22:03,955 --> 00:22:06,219
The opponent's reaction is just
like Greg Chapell's reaction

284
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:08,350
To Ganguly

285
00:22:09,795 --> 00:22:10,819
Who are they?

286
00:22:12,964 --> 00:22:14,329
You don't know that much?

287
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:17,495
Ganguly... our man... we call
him the prince of Calcutta

288
00:22:17,903 --> 00:22:19,768
That's why I'm recommending
a television...

289
00:22:19,871 --> 00:22:20,895
You'll learn everything

290
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,672
I know what gangrene is, I don't
need to know who Ganguly is.

291
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:28,377
We can cure TB here, but
we cannot provide TVs

292
00:22:28,814 --> 00:22:29,838
Fine.

293
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:34,477
Come what may... I will
watch the world cup...

294
00:22:34,619 --> 00:22:35,881
And I'll watch it right
here in your hospital.

295
00:22:35,987 --> 00:22:37,852
Feel free to watch it but not here.

296
00:22:38,824 --> 00:22:40,621
Watch it somewhere else,
and die somewhere else

297
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,351
We have many other patients
here, we need beds.

298
00:22:44,563 --> 00:22:45,587
Hold it high.

299
00:23:48,827 --> 00:23:49,851
What's going on? Tell us...

300
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,397
Is he batting? What's he doing?

301
00:23:53,565 --> 00:23:59,731
Let me get a good look... I can
see him... he's batting...

302
00:24:00,872 --> 00:24:02,863
And bowling and fielding all
at once... - Yes yes...

303
00:24:02,974 --> 00:24:04,407
Once more...

304
00:24:09,481 --> 00:24:10,880
Hey, what are you guys doing
outside my bedroom?

305
00:24:11,883 --> 00:24:16,445
If you're here, who's in there?

306
00:24:27,098 --> 00:24:28,497
India's winning...

307
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:31,459
Oh god, at least skip the cricket
on your wedding night

308
00:24:32,604 --> 00:24:35,437
Kash baby come here...
India's winning

309
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:39,534
Forget the cricket dude...

310
00:24:39,744 --> 00:24:41,769
Saby didn't bother you too
much last night did he?

311
00:24:42,113 --> 00:24:44,581
What can I say? We didn't
sleep at all...

312
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:48,013
I tried to calm him down
but you know how he is...

313
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,578
Saby's really naughty.

314
00:24:50,555 --> 00:24:52,785
Exactly... watching
cricket all night!

315
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:57,462
Cricket?! Oh no,
I should have known.

316
00:24:57,929 --> 00:24:59,453
Except for the drinks break

317
00:24:59,564 --> 00:25:00,588
you wouldn't even know it
was our wedding night

318
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,491
Both father and son
are incorrigible

319
00:25:03,735 --> 00:25:04,759
Dad too?

320
00:25:05,036 --> 00:25:07,470
What do you think? This
is a genetic disease

321
00:25:07,606 --> 00:25:09,471
Do you know what happened
on my wedding night?

322
00:25:09,574 --> 00:25:10,632
What happened?

323
00:25:14,779 --> 00:25:15,837
What are you doing?

324
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:22,419
I just wanted to say that
the entertainment programs

325
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:23,681
aren't on this late at night.

326
00:25:23,955 --> 00:25:25,422
India is playing the
West Indies today...

327
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:27,856
I'm putting on the commentary

328
00:25:27,993 --> 00:25:29,961
If you want, drink some
milk and go to sleep.

329
00:25:30,095 --> 00:25:31,858
Or you can make some tea with
the milk in the morning

330
00:25:31,963 --> 00:25:32,987
Ok, Goodnight.

331
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:38,100
Mom... what a family this is!

332
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:42,071
It's a genetic problem... they
all have it in degrees...

333
00:25:43,808 --> 00:25:46,572
But really, the wife is really the
12th player in a team of 11.

334
00:25:46,912 --> 00:25:51,076
All they think about is tea
and snacks in front of the TV

335
00:25:52,984 --> 00:25:54,451
Wait and watch... I'll ensure
that this disease

336
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:56,544
doesn't go on to
the next generation

337
00:25:57,622 --> 00:25:58,281
All the best!

338
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:01,783
Come in

339
00:26:03,695 --> 00:26:04,719
Good morning dad

340
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:07,524
Good mor
- what are you doing here?

341
00:26:08,133 --> 00:26:09,532
I brought you lunch

342
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:12,628
Ok, leave it here.

343
00:26:20,845 --> 00:26:22,574
Do you want to learn off
spin bowling? - Yes.

344
00:26:23,615 --> 00:26:24,639
Leg spin?

345
00:26:24,783 --> 00:26:25,807
Yes, yes...

346
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:27,677
Googly?

347
00:26:27,786 --> 00:26:28,810
Yes

348
00:26:28,954 --> 00:26:31,479
I'll teach you everything,
but first...

349
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,649
get your dad to allow
a TV in my room

350
00:26:33,792 --> 00:26:35,589
A TV? Here?

351
00:26:35,727 --> 00:26:39,754
The TV at home is ten years
old but it looks brand new...

352
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:41,963
We still haven't got rid
the plastic covers on it.

353
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:45,593
No radio, no TV, no cell phone

354
00:26:45,737 --> 00:26:46,761
Is he your dad or big boss?

355
00:26:48,907 --> 00:26:50,841
So you don't watch cricket matches?

356
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:52,569
I do, but not at home

357
00:26:52,744 --> 00:26:54,974
I say I have a study group and
go watch at a friend's place

358
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:56,580
Oh, excellent.

359
00:26:56,715 --> 00:26:58,615
The dad's a partypooper, but
the son still parties!

360
00:27:00,085 --> 00:27:03,885
If you want to learn to spin
bowl watch matches everyday

361
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:07,990
After every five overs, call
this phone outside my room

362
00:27:08,093 --> 00:27:09,117
And update me on the score.

363
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:11,994
That's your first assignment.

364
00:27:12,097 --> 00:27:13,121
Gimme five.

365
00:27:31,082 --> 00:27:32,106
Mr. Patel...

366
00:27:39,057 --> 00:27:40,081
May I come in Sir?

367
00:27:47,866 --> 00:27:48,890
Good morning Sir.
- Good morning.

368
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,629
Mr. Patel... Mr. Emu Patel

369
00:27:52,737 --> 00:27:53,761
Ya.

370
00:27:54,305 --> 00:27:56,865
How many million Patels
in the world, I wonder...

371
00:27:59,277 --> 00:28:01,643
And how many of you have barged
into Britain expecting

372
00:28:01,746 --> 00:28:02,872
Her to look after you and yours

373
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:05,741
Well, never mind...

374
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:08,783
let's just get to the point before
you sit down and start fawning

375
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:13,658
You must have read our manual,
"Life in the UK?"

376
00:28:13,792 --> 00:28:15,783
On how to get citizenship
of this great nation

377
00:28:16,227 --> 00:28:17,251
Yes

378
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:19,687
And you must have found how
very easy it is to get it

379
00:28:20,732 --> 00:28:21,756
Yes

380
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:23,898
Let me tell you Mr.
Patel it is not easy.

381
00:28:24,002 --> 00:28:25,663
And it is never going to
be easy while I'm here.

382
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:29,802
One Sardar Patel
threw us out of India

383
00:28:30,975 --> 00:28:32,772
And now the rest of them
have come to settle here

384
00:28:34,345 --> 00:28:35,903
Why can't you guys
make up your mind?

385
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:39,115
Now, show me your papers

386
00:28:45,156 --> 00:28:46,180
Thank you.

387
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:58,703
Saby... wake up wake up wake up...

388
00:29:00,305 --> 00:29:01,704
Baby...

389
00:29:02,173 --> 00:29:06,269
I've decided... our first
kid should be a boy. Ok?

390
00:29:06,611 --> 00:29:08,909
Kash... our kids are not
going to be made-to-order

391
00:29:09,047 --> 00:29:11,277
I don't know, I has to
be a boy, that's all!

392
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,741
I've even decided the name.

393
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:15,909
Nonsense
- What do you mean nonsense?

394
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:17,179
The dad will choose the name

395
00:29:18,022 --> 00:29:19,046
I have some names in mind too...

396
00:29:19,157 --> 00:29:20,181
Ok, tell me...

397
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:21,817
Gundappa.

398
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:25,730
What? Appa is dad, how
can the kid be appa?

399
00:29:25,897 --> 00:29:31,995
Hey!! He was an awesome batsman...
what style...

400
00:29:32,203 --> 00:29:34,728
Have you really lost it? You
need the name to call the kid

401
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:35,999
Not to scare him!
- Go away.

402
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:38,766
Think of something, quickly

403
00:29:40,812 --> 00:29:41,836
Muthiah

404
00:29:43,047 --> 00:29:45,072
What kind of name is Muthiah?

405
00:29:45,183 --> 00:29:46,912
Why why why? He's the best
off spinner in the world.

406
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:48,844
I've seen him.

407
00:29:49,154 --> 00:29:51,748
Before he spins the ball his
eyes seem to spin in his head

408
00:29:51,923 --> 00:29:58,123
No no no, I've got
a good name: Rishi

409
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:01,766
Rishi? No.

410
00:30:01,933 --> 00:30:03,798
Isn't that a saint?
No way. He'll be off

411
00:30:03,902 --> 00:30:06,234
meditating in the mountains
as soon as he's born

412
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:10,775
Enough jokes. I've decided
it's Rishi. So it's Rishi.

413
00:30:10,942 --> 00:30:11,966
That's final.

414
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:13,872
Sachin
- Rishi - Sunil - Rishi

415
00:30:14,012 --> 00:30:15,036
Ntini
- Should I slap you?

416
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:18,077
What? Hey... Rishi

417
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:21,145
Ok listen, neither your
suggestion nor mine

418
00:30:21,352 --> 00:30:22,785
Let's go with Mahendra Singh Dhoni.

419
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:24,880
Who's this now?

420
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:26,047
Dhoni! India's wicketkeeper

421
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:27,181
He's my favorite

422
00:30:27,859 --> 00:30:30,794
When he comes to bat, it's like
Tarzan walked onto the field

423
00:30:30,962 --> 00:30:33,089
And when he bats, it's like
he'll uproot a tree...

424
00:30:33,198 --> 00:30:34,222
Tarzan

425
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:35,891
Mahendra Singh Dhoni

426
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,937
No way it's Dhoni. No
way... not Dhoni...

427
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:00,847
Are you listening to the commentary?

428
00:31:01,125 --> 00:31:02,149
No, I have an earache

429
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:03,919
Get some medicine.

430
00:31:04,896 --> 00:31:05,954
Where are you going?

431
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:07,154
Study group

432
00:31:07,932 --> 00:31:09,024
What channel is that on tonight?

433
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:15,931
From now on, your study group
will be at the hospital

434
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:18,370
In my cabin... wherever I am

435
00:31:18,977 --> 00:31:20,069
Go on...

436
00:31:20,478 --> 00:31:21,502
Not that way, this way...

437
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:30,946
You too... Go to bed.
Good night. Thank you.

438
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:19,327
Saby, you dog

439
00:33:20,031 --> 00:33:21,055
Open the door

440
00:33:29,273 --> 00:33:34,040
Export your boss... you
won't have to work either

441
00:33:37,615 --> 00:33:39,014
Hey Sati... how's it going?

442
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:44,052
My name is Dr. Satyajeet. And
asking how you are is my job

443
00:33:44,155 --> 00:33:45,179
Not yours

444
00:33:45,456 --> 00:33:47,981
One look at your face and
I thought I should ask

445
00:33:48,292 --> 00:33:50,920
And what difference does it
make whether I use half your

446
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:53,190
name or the whole thing. It's
not going to change you...

447
00:33:54,065 --> 00:33:55,999
I'm not a chameleon that I'm
going to change colours.

448
00:33:57,635 --> 00:34:03,039
Sleep well tonight. You won't
be getting any calls.

449
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:07,006
I knew it...

450
00:34:07,311 --> 00:34:10,007
you are Australia and that
poor kid is Bangladesh

451
00:34:10,181 --> 00:34:11,273
He had to lose.

452
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,041
You don't understand anything
about cricket pal...

453
00:34:14,185 --> 00:34:15,277
Ok, I'll explain it to you.

454
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:20,013
Let's say this is the pitch...
this is the silly mid-off

455
00:34:20,191 --> 00:34:24,059
This is the silly mid-off... here's
the gully and this is deep

456
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:28,562
You're in deep trouble...
your kidneys

457
00:34:28,666 --> 00:34:29,690
Take care of them...

458
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:35,039
My kidneys seem to be run out...
we're just waiting for

459
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:38,041
The final call from the 3rd umpire

460
00:34:38,476 --> 00:34:40,137
You're on dialysis, you won't die.

461
00:34:40,445 --> 00:34:44,040
Don't say "so what if your kidneys
fail... you will still"

462
00:34:44,215 --> 00:34:47,082
"Be able to feel the first rays
of the sun, or a gentle breeze

463
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:50,049
Or hear the birds chirping..."

464
00:34:50,354 --> 00:34:53,050
Those things do have their
own special joy...

465
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:56,083
When was the last time you
enjoyed those things?

466
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,191
I don't have time for such things

467
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:01,156
Why? You don't have the
right to be happy?

468
00:35:01,299 --> 00:35:02,323
I am happy.

469
00:35:04,135 --> 00:35:06,660
If this is happiness, people will
stop praying for happiness

470
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:13,234
You won't allow me a
television will you?

471
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:15,603
No.

472
00:35:20,151 --> 00:35:22,585
Hey you left me a message...
is everything ok?

473
00:35:24,555 --> 00:35:30,551
What is it? Is there a problem?
Did you fight with Saby?

474
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,188
Kash, say something...

475
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:36,223
I hate cricket

476
00:35:37,235 --> 00:35:38,259
What?

477
00:35:38,669 --> 00:35:42,696
Ya. Saby watches cricket 24 hour.

478
00:35:44,175 --> 00:35:48,111
He calls out to Sachin More often
than he calls out to me.

479
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:51,113
Thanks to this world cup, we
haven't even been on a honeymoon

480
00:35:51,282 --> 00:35:52,306
That's it?

481
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:59,112
What do you mean that's
it? I feel so alone.

482
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:01,157
If you can't beat them, join them.

483
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,218
What?

484
00:36:03,361 --> 00:36:04,385
Why don't you watch
cricket with him?

485
00:36:05,696 --> 00:36:08,460
I tried but it's really boring.

486
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:10,361
It goes on and on...

487
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:13,163
Not like soccer that gets
done in a couple of hours

488
00:36:13,304 --> 00:36:14,328
What's wrong with you stupid?

489
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:17,167
Why don't you look at the 22
hot men standing before you

490
00:36:17,808 --> 00:36:19,275
And they're not running around
like soccer players

491
00:36:19,443 --> 00:36:22,139
And when they run up
to you to bowl...

492
00:36:22,313 --> 00:36:24,144
What uniforms, what bodies...

493
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:25,472
Are you crazy?

494
00:36:25,616 --> 00:36:27,777
I'm not crazy, you are blind

495
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:30,084
50% of the women who watch
cricket, watch it for

496
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:33,248
The cricketers. And what's
wrong with that?

497
00:36:33,824 --> 00:36:36,088
Everyone's happy. When
he's watching the match

498
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:37,286
You check out the players...

499
00:36:39,463 --> 00:36:41,328
Your problem will be
instantly resolved.

500
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:49,264
Hemu, your coffee

501
00:36:49,407 --> 00:36:50,499
Thanks

502
00:36:57,481 --> 00:37:03,647
Hello. Ya? Yes sir. Yes.

503
00:37:08,292 --> 00:37:10,226
You want me to come today sir?

504
00:37:13,831 --> 00:37:16,197
I'll be there.

505
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:20,594
What's up Hemu?

506
00:37:21,806 --> 00:37:25,207
The citizenship officer wants
to meet me in the pub

507
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:26,400
So?

508
00:37:27,511 --> 00:37:30,207
What it's like match-fixing...
palm-greasing?

509
00:37:30,448 --> 00:37:32,006
You never know with these people.

510
00:37:38,556 --> 00:37:40,683
Sir I've brought everything,
I got everything...

511
00:37:40,791 --> 00:37:41,815
Show me, show me...

512
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:43,257
Sir, it was really hard
to pull it off...

513
00:37:45,896 --> 00:37:48,831
Binoculars
- Wow, binoculars. A radio?

514
00:37:49,467 --> 00:37:51,765
I have that too...
- Wow. Gimme five.

515
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:59,701
Why is the door closed?
Leave it open.

516
00:39:03,441 --> 00:39:04,567
Why are you hanging on to that?

517
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:14,409
Why are you laughing?

518
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:40,708
David found a great way
to watch the match...

519
00:39:41,412 --> 00:39:43,346
He knocked over Dr Satyajeet's
middle wicket!

520
00:39:43,514 --> 00:39:44,538
All while lying flat.

521
00:39:47,418 --> 00:39:48,442
Good Morning Sir.
- Come here...

522
00:39:53,924 --> 00:39:54,948
What's going on here

523
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:57,691
Sir, nothing... nobody's
watching the match here

524
00:40:00,431 --> 00:40:01,455
Did I ask about the match?

525
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:07,496
Sorry sir...

526
00:40:11,942 --> 00:40:12,966
We're dead

527
00:41:58,816 --> 00:42:01,410
Drink up... you guys need it.
Our guy has taken the piss

528
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:03,510
Out of your team. Your England is...

529
00:42:35,753 --> 00:42:39,519
There's him, up there. And
you in front of me - Hitler

530
00:42:40,157 --> 00:42:43,718
He's waiting for me to die,
you're not letting me live

531
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:47,121
I'm not letting you live, or is
it that you don't want to live?

532
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:50,830
Since you got here, nobody's
focused on the job any more

533
00:42:51,669 --> 00:42:54,536
All day it's radio, TV, commentary...

534
00:42:55,139 --> 00:42:57,573
Did I ask you to come here
during the World Cup?

535
00:42:57,841 --> 00:43:00,537
If it was up to me why
would I be here?

536
00:43:01,612 --> 00:43:03,546
You think I'm enjoying this, right...

537
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:06,678
Come, take a look. I watch from
here with the binoculars

538
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:12,646
There's traffic all around, I
can't see or hear anything...

539
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:16,583
Whenever a good bowler
comes to the pitch,

540
00:43:16,694 --> 00:43:17,718
Someone blocks my view.

541
00:43:18,228 --> 00:43:20,128
I see more backsides than balls.

542
00:43:21,198 --> 00:43:23,564
But you won't get me a TV.

543
00:43:24,168 --> 00:43:25,567
What's the big deal about cricket?

544
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:31,564
I don't know. Whenever
I watch, I feel alive

545
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:34,601
What's the connection between
life... and a game?

546
00:43:34,712 --> 00:43:35,736
Maybe there isn't one.

547
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:38,605
But there is a connection
between life and happiness?

548
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:43,948
I want to live happily
not half-heartedly

549
00:43:44,254 --> 00:43:47,712
Which is why I'm asking
you to get me a TV

550
00:43:47,891 --> 00:43:51,588
and then see how my
health improves.

551
00:43:53,263 --> 00:43:55,823
Let's take a bet
- it won't be you

552
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:57,692
But cricket that will save me.

553
00:43:58,669 --> 00:44:00,637
Fine, you're on.

554
00:44:00,771 --> 00:44:04,036
What? Really? Are you serious?

555
00:44:04,875 --> 00:44:07,935
Look, you said yes and
my hiccups are gone.

556
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:11,877
If you continue to act this
stubborn, soon you'll be gone.

557
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:44,739
TV

558
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:13,138
And the remote... Thanks pal

559
00:45:20,084 --> 00:45:21,108
Thanks pal.

560
00:45:23,787 --> 00:45:26,688
There's a match tonight...
let's watch it together

561
00:45:26,857 --> 00:45:27,881
lt'll be fun.

562
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:30,990
That's your TV, this is mine...

563
00:45:31,729 --> 00:45:33,890
If I watch your TV,
who will treat you?

564
00:45:34,064 --> 00:45:36,692
Cricket. I've got cricket

565
00:45:42,339 --> 00:45:43,363
Thank you

566
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:46,099
Congratulations.

567
00:46:05,863 --> 00:46:07,023
Hey... you're watching the match?

568
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:14,727
TV and wife... my life
is all set... Wow

569
00:46:36,994 --> 00:46:38,018
Priya... Priya...

570
00:46:40,798 --> 00:46:41,992
What happened? What is it?

571
00:46:43,167 --> 00:46:46,102
Ask her what she was doing
with that animal downstairs

572
00:46:46,436 --> 00:46:47,767
His name is Silver

573
00:46:47,871 --> 00:46:48,895
I'll cut off your tongue

574
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:51,001
But what has she done?

575
00:46:51,441 --> 00:46:56,208
Our daughter, was downstairs, in
the dark, with that black guy

576
00:46:56,313 --> 00:46:57,337
Glued to him...

577
00:46:58,916 --> 00:46:59,940
Are these our values?

578
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:02,217
Look what's happening
behind our backs?

579
00:47:02,853 --> 00:47:05,185
They eat pickled cows!

580
00:47:07,958 --> 00:47:10,358
Who is he? Who is he?

581
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:13,987
Who would he be? Some
gangster-rapper drug addict

582
00:47:14,097 --> 00:47:15,792
Like all black guys

583
00:47:15,899 --> 00:47:17,833
For your information Dad,
he's an engineering student

584
00:47:19,369 --> 00:47:20,859
And he's much smarter than you are

585
00:47:25,075 --> 00:47:26,838
See this... see this...

586
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:32,043
See this...
- Hemu... Hemu please

587
00:47:44,995 --> 00:47:48,988
It's all messed up...
It's all gone wrong...

588
00:47:51,902 --> 00:47:59,104
I couldn't be a good father,
or a good son... or a citizen

589
00:48:06,483 --> 00:48:08,974
The citizenship isn't crucial

590
00:48:09,186 --> 00:48:14,214
It is crucial. To get a
good job, a good salary

591
00:48:15,025 --> 00:48:16,788
To get some respect... to
be able to go back to India

592
00:48:16,894 --> 00:48:17,952
With my head held high

593
00:48:19,162 --> 00:48:20,857
You can go to India even now...

594
00:48:21,331 --> 00:48:24,027
What will I go there and say?
What will I say to my mother?

595
00:48:24,468 --> 00:48:26,868
Mom, look, yourjanitor
son is back from London

596
00:48:26,970 --> 00:48:30,133
where he cleans toilets
and sweeps the floor

597
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,231
to earn his meager living

598
00:48:33,377 --> 00:48:35,140
You work for your living...
you don't beg do you?

599
00:48:35,913 --> 00:48:41,044
Priya... I have failed. Yes...

600
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:44,114
They had hopes for me...

601
00:48:46,523 --> 00:48:49,890
My mother sold all her gold so
that she could send me here

602
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:55,357
to become someone.
What did I become?

603
00:48:57,601 --> 00:49:00,934
Forget greatness... I couldn't
even pay her back for the gold

604
00:49:01,538 --> 00:49:06,066
Hemu, you are like gold to her.
She's still waiting for you...

605
00:49:06,576 --> 00:49:10,910
You know, we had a neighbour
who used to come to India

606
00:49:11,214 --> 00:49:17,244
with gifts for each person.
Something small...

607
00:49:18,555 --> 00:49:19,954
What will I take back?

608
00:49:21,591 --> 00:49:25,049
All our income, our savings... our
medicines cost us half of it,

609
00:49:25,228 --> 00:49:26,923
And survival cost us the rest...

610
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:29,125
What will I take home?

611
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:36,940
Until I get my citizenship,
things will not change

612
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:41,334
And I will make sure things change.

613
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:46,847
Oh shit...

614
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:55,481
Listen, hold each other's hands.

615
00:49:57,127 --> 00:49:58,151
Sir?

616
00:49:58,261 --> 00:49:59,285
It's all in the attitude

617
00:49:59,396 --> 00:50:01,387
Hold hands quickly... you'll see,
he'll start hitting fours.

618
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:03,227
Just hold hands... he'll hit a four.

619
00:50:05,202 --> 00:50:06,294
That's better.

620
00:50:07,304 --> 00:50:09,101
Hey, Dhoni's come...
we love you Dhoni...

621
00:50:09,206 --> 00:50:10,230
I was telling you about Dhoni...

622
00:50:11,408 --> 00:50:13,899
Come on Dhoni... I'm telling
you he's just like Tarzan

623
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:15,069
See what he does

624
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:19,539
Good shot.

625
00:50:56,186 --> 00:50:57,278
What a shot...

626
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:07,030
I love you baby...

627
00:51:26,116 --> 00:51:29,051
Oh... Dhoni...

628
00:51:29,352 --> 00:51:34,380
Hey... why are you saying
Dhoni... It's SABY

629
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:37,492
What did I say? I said your name...

630
00:51:37,627 --> 00:51:38,992
Hey, I'm not deaf... I can
tell the difference between

631
00:51:39,096 --> 00:51:41,326
Dhoni-Dhoni and Saby-Saby

632
00:51:41,731 --> 00:51:43,164
But why would I call you Dhoni?

633
00:51:43,533 --> 00:51:46,058
How do I know? That's
what I'm asking you...

634
00:51:47,104 --> 00:51:49,129
Saby I think you're going mad...

635
00:51:49,539 --> 00:51:52,064
His name is echoing in your
head... Dhoni Dhoni Dhoni

636
00:51:52,676 --> 00:51:54,075
Go watch your cricket match,
I'm going to bed.

637
00:51:55,278 --> 00:51:56,302
Good night.

638
00:52:05,489 --> 00:52:06,513
What the hell...

639
00:52:18,301 --> 00:52:21,327
What? What what... What baby?

640
00:52:21,438 --> 00:52:22,462
Nothing...

641
00:52:22,772 --> 00:52:24,137
What's happened baby?

642
00:52:24,241 --> 00:52:25,265
Nothing. Forget it...

643
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:34,174
What? What?

644
00:52:52,235 --> 00:52:55,295
I don't know what's happening,
what's wrong,

645
00:52:55,438 --> 00:52:58,134
I'm sorry... - What the
hell... What's happening...

646
00:52:59,543 --> 00:53:01,135
Saby...

647
00:53:14,624 --> 00:53:16,148
Sir, Hemu Patel

648
00:53:17,394 --> 00:53:19,191
Emu Patel. What the hell
is wrong with you.

649
00:53:19,696 --> 00:53:23,564
Sir, what you saw in the pub
that day, it was all wrong...

650
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:26,192
That was for the Indian
community to cheer up

651
00:53:26,336 --> 00:53:27,360
Just like... just like
a cheer leader

652
00:53:28,805 --> 00:53:33,174
Sir, I love Britain.
I love Great Britain.

653
00:53:34,511 --> 00:53:36,206
I love being part of it...
Sir. Really.

654
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:42,481
And sir if you don't like
something about me

655
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:45,211
I'll get rid of it...

656
00:53:45,355 --> 00:53:47,186
I'm ready to dress up like this
for the rest of my life Sir

657
00:53:47,290 --> 00:53:48,314
Yes, Sir.

658
00:53:48,725 --> 00:53:50,215
I'm not going to get into
this conversation...

659
00:53:50,427 --> 00:53:55,194
Sir... Sir... Please wait sir...
This is very important for me

660
00:53:55,699 --> 00:53:58,293
My mother's 60th birthday.

661
00:53:58,501 --> 00:54:01,527
It's my mother's birthday...
I have to be there Sir.

662
00:54:01,871 --> 00:54:04,806
So go. Who's stopping you?
This matter is closed for me.

663
00:54:05,342 --> 00:54:07,503
Closed? What do you mean closed?

664
00:54:10,647 --> 00:54:16,415
Sir, I'm really sorry Sir... please
don't do this to me Sir

665
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:21,213
I beg of you... don't do this to me...

666
00:54:21,491 --> 00:54:23,356
Sir my mother's birthday...
please sir

667
00:54:23,693 --> 00:54:26,787
Mr. Emu Patel if you don't
let go of me now

668
00:54:27,264 --> 00:54:29,255
I will make sure that your
life is miserable here.

669
00:54:44,614 --> 00:54:45,638
Morning Doctor...

670
00:54:46,483 --> 00:54:48,246
The angel of death that
was waiting on the roof

671
00:54:48,718 --> 00:54:50,276
Has descended a floor,
closer to you...

672
00:54:51,288 --> 00:54:54,689
You love mocking me...
what did I do now?

673
00:54:57,527 --> 00:54:58,551
You watched the match?

674
00:54:59,296 --> 00:55:03,255
Thanks pal... I had a blast. The
fourth ball of the 3rd over-

675
00:55:03,433 --> 00:55:05,526
These are the pre-match reports

676
00:55:06,736 --> 00:55:08,260
These are the post-match reports

677
00:55:09,939 --> 00:55:11,839
Whether India bags the world
cup or not, you have

678
00:55:12,575 --> 00:55:15,271
Definitely bagged your
place in heaven...

679
00:55:15,412 --> 00:55:18,745
The reports are bad? I'll make
it to the finals won't I?

680
00:55:19,549 --> 00:55:20,573
You are going to die.

681
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:23,479
Hey you talk to patients this way?

682
00:55:24,354 --> 00:55:25,514
Even healthy people
will die on the spot

683
00:55:26,589 --> 00:55:29,717
Show us that smile some time,
laugh occasionally

684
00:55:29,826 --> 00:55:30,850
What is your problem?

685
00:55:32,329 --> 00:55:35,298
Watching people die
doesn't make me smile

686
00:55:35,498 --> 00:55:37,898
But that's yourjob...
facing life and death

687
00:55:38,401 --> 00:55:40,232
If you're so afraid of your job,
change your profession

688
00:55:40,337 --> 00:55:43,363
Become a chef... you can use
your knife there as well...

689
00:55:43,606 --> 00:55:45,471
I'm sending the ward boy,
the TV goes out...

690
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:48,303
Send four, they can
carry me out too...

691
00:55:49,813 --> 00:55:50,837
What do you want?

692
00:55:51,348 --> 00:55:55,307
Just two things. A television,
and a smile on your face.

693
00:55:56,419 --> 00:55:57,443
Why

694
00:55:57,620 --> 00:55:59,884
Why do you need a reason
to smile? Look at me...

695
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:02,317
I'm dying but I'm happy.

696
00:56:02,625 --> 00:56:06,994
You're fine, but your
face is a shroud. Why?

697
00:56:07,731 --> 00:56:09,323
I'm fine the way I am...

698
00:56:10,567 --> 00:56:11,625
What are you?

699
00:56:11,935 --> 00:56:13,926
You keep chanting about cricket

700
00:56:14,037 --> 00:56:15,368
What has the game given you?

701
00:56:16,373 --> 00:56:17,465
Has anyone come to see you?

702
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:19,403
Does anyone care whether
you're dead or alive?

703
00:56:20,009 --> 00:56:21,442
Not a relative, not a friend.

704
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:24,472
Yeah, I have no one.

705
00:56:24,948 --> 00:56:27,416
That's why I value the
things I don't have.

706
00:56:28,551 --> 00:56:29,609
You have it all...

707
00:56:30,387 --> 00:56:32,912
So why have you cut yourself
off from life?

708
00:56:57,914 --> 00:56:59,677
Good morning, how are you?

709
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:18,560
Which one have you bought?

710
00:57:19,436 --> 00:57:20,494
It's good right?

711
00:57:21,571 --> 00:57:22,595
I don't like it

712
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,635
Saby, you should try something
new sometimes

713
00:57:25,842 --> 00:57:26,866
Eat it, come on...

714
00:57:33,550 --> 00:57:35,677
Sorry I forgot the juice.
I'll be right back...

715
00:57:42,058 --> 00:57:43,457
I'm fine the way I am...

716
00:57:43,793 --> 00:57:44,817
What are you?

717
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:46,520
You keep chanting about cricket

718
00:57:46,629 --> 00:57:47,687
What has the game given you?

719
00:57:48,665 --> 00:57:50,462
Has anyone come to see you?

720
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:52,696
Does anyone care whether
you're dead or alive?

721
00:57:53,670 --> 00:57:55,535
Not a relative, not a friend.

722
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:11,784
Sir... David

723
00:58:11,888 --> 00:58:12,912
What's happened?

724
00:58:13,022 --> 00:58:14,455
David has collapsed.

725
00:58:15,492 --> 00:58:16,584
Sir, this way...

726
00:58:25,902 --> 00:58:28,462
In the match of life, you've
never cheered for anyone

727
00:58:29,639 --> 00:58:31,470
It's time for you to change Sattu...

728
00:58:33,243 --> 00:58:34,608
Life's all about change, change
is the name of the game

729
00:59:26,930 --> 00:59:27,954
Sit down

730
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:50,678
I'll get dinner ready

731
00:59:51,020 --> 00:59:52,112
We'll eat...

732
00:59:56,593 --> 00:59:57,651
Go and get dressed.

733
01:00:03,132 --> 01:00:04,599
You too... get dressed

734
01:00:05,668 --> 01:00:07,761
Can I... watch the match?

735
01:00:12,208 --> 01:00:13,232
Take this.

736
01:00:22,185 --> 01:00:23,584
What on earth is going on?

737
01:00:27,790 --> 01:00:29,849
They wouldn't scream so loud even
if they were witnessing a riot.

738
01:00:32,161 --> 01:00:34,595
They don't scream when scores
of farmers commit suicide

739
01:00:37,634 --> 01:00:38,658
or when bombs rip through the city...

740
01:00:38,768 --> 01:00:39,792
No wonder then that the only thing
that's sacred for them is

741
01:00:45,675 --> 01:00:48,143
their standard of living

742
01:00:48,244 --> 01:00:49,609
Who's spending what...

743
01:00:49,712 --> 01:00:50,804
That's all that matters...

744
01:00:54,250 --> 01:00:56,548
At least in the silence of
the hospital you can hear

745
01:00:56,653 --> 01:00:57,711
the sound of death.

746
01:00:58,688 --> 01:00:59,746
There, I can save someone's life...

747
01:01:04,761 --> 01:01:05,819
I'm extremely sorry.

748
01:01:06,929 --> 01:01:08,624
I'm sorry. I'm feeling
claustrophobic here...

749
01:01:08,731 --> 01:01:09,755
Let's go somewhere else...

750
01:01:15,304 --> 01:01:17,636
They're a rowdy bunch,
go somewhere else

751
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:35,681
What's up? That's a sudden change...

752
01:01:35,958 --> 01:01:37,755
You don't want to watch
India play today?

753
01:01:37,994 --> 01:01:43,660
Forget the match... Kash,
I need to talk to you...

754
01:01:44,267 --> 01:01:45,199
What?

755
01:01:46,302 --> 01:01:50,671
You know... from the
first time I saw you

756
01:01:51,274 --> 01:01:53,674
To even think about another
woman seems wrong.

757
01:01:55,144 --> 01:01:57,612
I want you to be the
only one for me...

758
01:01:57,714 --> 01:02:01,013
and me the only one
for you. Nobody else.

759
01:02:03,753 --> 01:02:05,778
And your name to be the
only one on my lips

760
01:02:06,255 --> 01:02:08,246
And you to be the only
one I dream of...

761
01:02:09,358 --> 01:02:16,787
And when I open my eyes...
it's just to look at you...

762
01:02:37,754 --> 01:02:38,846
What's the situation?

763
01:02:39,021 --> 01:02:40,852
The bowel movements haven't
improved much.

764
01:02:41,190 --> 01:02:42,214
We need more tests...

765
01:02:42,792 --> 01:02:45,124
I'm not talking about myself,
I'm talking about you two

766
01:02:45,928 --> 01:02:46,986
What are you saying, sir...

767
01:02:48,765 --> 01:02:51,757
So that means no deterioration,
no improvement

768
01:02:51,901 --> 01:02:57,737
As the heartbeat goes for
six, the girl blushes

769
01:02:57,940 --> 01:02:59,066
And both of them laugh

770
01:03:03,212 --> 01:03:04,236
Ganesh...

771
01:03:05,014 --> 01:03:06,777
Call Dr. Satyajit immediately

772
01:03:07,917 --> 01:03:08,941
Sir, breathe... please...

773
01:03:09,786 --> 01:03:10,810
Calm down...

774
01:03:12,789 --> 01:03:13,847
Sir...

775
01:03:16,058 --> 01:03:18,754
Calm down... Calm down...

776
01:03:23,466 --> 01:03:25,024
Did he throw up?
- No Sir.

777
01:03:29,372 --> 01:03:30,396
Give him an anti-convulgent

778
01:03:31,474 --> 01:03:33,772
IV, Absolvent 100mg

779
01:03:34,177 --> 01:03:36,372
There is a very high level
of creatinine in the blood

780
01:03:36,813 --> 01:03:40,146
Hypertension, no improvement
after dialysis

781
01:03:43,085 --> 01:03:47,784
Try dialysis again. Send tissue
type and cross match.

782
01:03:48,825 --> 01:03:52,784
He needs a kidney transplant,
or the devil will die here.

783
01:03:52,962 --> 01:03:54,793
Sir, "David"

784
01:03:55,298 --> 01:03:57,789
David, Devil... same thing.

785
01:03:58,100 --> 01:03:59,863
We have to control his Peritonitis.

786
01:04:00,369 --> 01:04:02,803
We can't opearte with the infection.
We can't do the transplant.

787
01:04:04,841 --> 01:04:05,899
Find a donor.

788
01:04:21,924 --> 01:04:24,825
This is Harmendar. You won't
even answer your phone

789
01:04:24,961 --> 01:04:28,021
Where are you? Why aren't
you coming to work?

790
01:04:28,130 --> 01:04:29,825
We're all worried about you

791
01:04:30,166 --> 01:04:33,226
Look if you want a break, at
least put in an application

792
01:04:33,336 --> 01:04:34,826
Or there'll be trouble here...

793
01:04:35,137 --> 01:04:37,935
Listen Hemu, please call
me back, ok? Bye

794
01:04:45,081 --> 01:04:46,105
Hi baby,

795
01:04:48,885 --> 01:04:51,877
Saby, look, I entered a contest

796
01:04:52,288 --> 01:04:54,848
If I win I get to go out
to dinner with Dhoni

797
01:04:55,024 --> 01:04:56,787
What sort of... up company
sends people's wives

798
01:04:56,893 --> 01:04:58,053
on dates with other men?

799
01:04:58,227 --> 01:04:59,854
I'll sue the...

800
01:05:00,897 --> 01:05:04,856
You're getting upset? I
thought you'd help me.

801
01:05:05,001 --> 01:05:07,060
Right... I'm the biggest
in the world...

802
01:05:07,236 --> 01:05:08,794
I'll escort you over there,
seat you beside him

803
01:05:08,905 --> 01:05:10,133
And come back home alone.

804
01:05:10,940 --> 01:05:12,202
But you like him don't you...

805
01:05:12,341 --> 01:05:14,866
I did, but I'm sick
of the Indian team.

806
01:05:15,044 --> 01:05:17,410
I want them to lose every match And
Dhoni to get out without scoring

807
01:05:18,915 --> 01:05:20,075
What's happened to you
all of a sudden?

808
01:05:20,182 --> 01:05:21,877
India is your life...

809
01:05:21,984 --> 01:05:23,144
And... Dhoni is your life?

810
01:05:28,257 --> 01:05:30,817
But he's really cute. And
more than half the women

811
01:05:30,927 --> 01:05:32,986
who watch cricket watch
for the players anyway.

812
01:05:33,195 --> 01:05:35,390
And you're one of them.

813
01:05:35,932 --> 01:05:37,923
Hey, why are you pointing
a finger at me?

814
01:05:38,067 --> 01:05:40,001
You watch only women's tennis...

815
01:05:40,202 --> 01:05:42,261
Women's singles, women's doubles,
mixed doubles...

816
01:05:42,371 --> 01:05:43,395
Who knows what...

817
01:05:43,506 --> 01:05:44,837
Yeah, but I don't hold you and say

818
01:05:44,941 --> 01:05:47,136
"Oh Anna" "Oh Sharapova" do I?

819
01:05:48,945 --> 01:05:52,904
Look Saby, I'm sorry. That
was wrong, I admit...

820
01:05:53,215 --> 01:05:54,944
But why are you making
a big deal about it?

821
01:05:55,051 --> 01:05:56,075
Thinking about it isn't so wrong...

822
01:05:56,252 --> 01:05:58,447
You only think about
it when you want it

823
01:05:59,288 --> 01:06:02,485
Really? So have you thought
about why this happened?

824
01:06:03,159 --> 01:06:04,387
Were you ever around for me? No...

825
01:06:04,961 --> 01:06:07,452
And even if I did think it,
what's the problem

826
01:06:07,964 --> 01:06:09,022
It's not going to happen...

827
01:06:09,298 --> 01:06:14,361
And anyway, you're just as
hot as my Dhoni, really...

828
01:06:16,205 --> 01:06:18,196
There are 9 other players too...
call their names too.

829
01:06:18,975 --> 01:06:20,033
What's wrong with you Saby?

830
01:06:22,011 --> 01:06:23,171
No, what's wrong with you?

831
01:06:26,248 --> 01:06:28,944
Look, I don't think
I did anything wrong.

832
01:06:29,118 --> 01:06:30,176
Think what you want...

833
01:06:30,286 --> 01:06:33,380
Yes yes yes... It's my fault
and I'm regretting it-

834
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:35,048
Regretting marrying me?

835
01:06:35,157 --> 01:06:37,955
I don't know. Think what you want.

836
01:06:38,127 --> 01:06:39,151
Saby
- - I'm leaving...

837
01:06:48,004 --> 01:06:49,995
Is this Mr. Emu Pateel's house?

838
01:06:50,139 --> 01:06:51,163
Ya, that's me.

839
01:06:51,273 --> 01:06:52,297
We've orders to inspect your house.

840
01:06:52,408 --> 01:06:53,432
We have a warrant here.

841
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:56,979
For what?
- Please co-operate Sir. Come on,

842
01:07:00,082 --> 01:07:01,174
What's the problem?

843
01:07:01,283 --> 01:07:03,148
Please sir, what's the problem?

844
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:06,545
Mr. Patel you haven't gone
to work for 7 days now

845
01:07:06,655 --> 01:07:08,486
Without any leave application
or notice

846
01:07:08,591 --> 01:07:09,990
But so what? That's my wish...

847
01:07:10,459 --> 01:07:12,984
I didn't go to work so now the cops
have showed up to take me to work.

848
01:07:13,162 --> 01:07:14,186
You didn't go to work?

849
01:07:14,296 --> 01:07:15,320
My wish!

850
01:07:15,464 --> 01:07:17,455
Mom, Daddy, why are the cops here?

851
01:07:17,566 --> 01:07:21,002
Because we're Indian,
we're brown-skinned

852
01:07:21,137 --> 01:07:23,162
And they think that every
brown skin is terrorist.

853
01:07:23,305 --> 01:07:25,569
Sir, I'm quite sure you're
aware of everything

854
01:07:25,674 --> 01:07:27,005
You work at the airport...

855
01:07:27,176 --> 01:07:30,009
By order we conduct a check
at those airport employees'

856
01:07:30,146 --> 01:07:32,580
residences that disappear
from work suddenly.

857
01:07:33,049 --> 01:07:34,107
Bull...

858
01:07:34,483 --> 01:07:36,178
I'm going to complain
to home department

859
01:07:36,318 --> 01:07:37,376
You think we are terrorists

860
01:07:37,486 --> 01:07:39,010
Hemu... Hemu...

861
01:07:44,226 --> 01:07:47,491
What are the cop cars here for...
what's the problem?

862
01:07:47,596 --> 01:07:49,029
Nothing there was some confusion

863
01:07:49,131 --> 01:07:50,155
They came to my place by mistake

864
01:07:54,470 --> 01:07:56,028
We are very sorry for
inconveniencing you

865
01:07:56,138 --> 01:07:57,162
You're clean.

866
01:07:59,508 --> 01:08:02,033
And try to remember not to
let this affect your work

867
01:08:02,545 --> 01:08:04,206
Yourjob as a janitor remains.

868
01:08:13,089 --> 01:08:17,082
One second dear... what
does your dad do?

869
01:08:17,626 --> 01:08:20,322
How do I know what he's
said to you guys?

870
01:08:31,407 --> 01:08:33,102
Yes... Yes...

871
01:08:33,209 --> 01:08:34,233
Get Dhoni out too...

872
01:08:34,710 --> 01:08:37,076
Who's this idiot? He
wants India to lose?

873
01:08:37,179 --> 01:08:38,203
Shut up... and mind
your own business...

874
01:08:38,380 --> 01:08:41,076
Hey dude, you'll be four feet
tall if I lop off your legs...

875
01:08:44,220 --> 01:08:46,279
Hey, stop getting upset...

876
01:08:46,455 --> 01:08:49,424
He was one of us earlier...
devoted to the Indian team...

877
01:08:49,525 --> 01:08:50,549
So what's happened to him?

878
01:08:50,659 --> 01:08:52,490
His wife has become devoted
to one of the players

879
01:08:52,628 --> 01:08:56,086
Since then he looks at the
men in blue and sees red...

880
01:09:03,539 --> 01:09:04,563
Leave me alone.

881
01:10:33,362 --> 01:10:38,197
What's up big guy... you
done playing the VIP?

882
01:10:40,236 --> 01:10:43,296
Mr. Patel, Sir, how's your airport?

883
01:10:44,673 --> 01:10:47,198
Without his permission
a pin can't get in...

884
01:10:47,910 --> 01:10:51,368
His job is to keep an
eye on ins and outs...

885
01:10:52,715 --> 01:10:53,739
What are you guys?

886
01:10:56,252 --> 01:11:00,689
What are you? A backward
caste who's paid to get

887
01:11:01,257 --> 01:11:03,248
A new name so you can hang
out with the higher ups...

888
01:11:04,426 --> 01:11:07,156
And you... you send your
parents off to the mall

889
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:09,493
every morning so that you can
turn the heat off at home

890
01:11:09,598 --> 01:11:11,259
And keep your electricity bill low...

891
01:11:13,535 --> 01:11:15,867
Don't look at what I do
look at how you behave...

892
01:11:16,739 --> 01:11:20,505
Hemu, we've seen all that
we need to see...

893
01:11:21,644 --> 01:11:22,702
Now go home...

894
01:11:24,713 --> 01:11:25,737
Come on...

895
01:11:46,669 --> 01:11:48,864
If you don't get a donor,
your game's over

896
01:11:54,643 --> 01:11:57,407
And it's not that easy
to find a kidney

897
01:12:00,416 --> 01:12:02,281
Why am I telling you all this?

898
01:12:05,321 --> 01:12:08,779
Cricket... cricket... my team

899
01:12:14,530 --> 01:12:15,588
You'll die alone

900
01:12:25,741 --> 01:12:31,839
Sir... you know David... you
have to make him well...

901
01:12:33,382 --> 01:12:34,474
You have to make him well.

902
01:12:36,552 --> 01:12:38,611
Are you ordering me
or requesting me?

903
01:12:39,755 --> 01:12:40,779
Get back to work...

904
01:12:55,371 --> 01:12:57,635
Sir... how is David Abraham?

905
01:12:57,873 --> 01:12:59,864
He died
- Sir, what are you saying?

906
01:12:59,975 --> 01:13:02,341
I'm dead too... you
can go and die too...

907
01:13:02,444 --> 01:13:03,468
Hey... you're...

908
01:13:07,883 --> 01:13:11,444
Doctor... can you use a
woman's kidney for a man?

909
01:13:11,653 --> 01:13:13,348
Did you find one while cleaning up?

910
01:13:13,722 --> 01:13:15,383
Will my kidney work
for David Abraham?

911
01:13:15,791 --> 01:13:17,486
I can work sitting down...

912
01:13:17,659 --> 01:13:19,286
Look, we're talking about
kidneys not candy...

913
01:13:19,395 --> 01:13:20,487
Oh give him some instead of me...

914
01:13:20,662 --> 01:13:21,686
It takes time... do your work...

915
01:13:25,167 --> 01:13:26,395
Should I try?

916
01:13:29,405 --> 01:13:31,396
Yes? What's the problem?

917
01:13:33,041 --> 01:13:38,707
Sir... David... To
save David's life-

918
01:13:38,947 --> 01:13:41,745
Look, I'm doing all I can.
If it's not enough

919
01:13:41,850 --> 01:13:44,375
You do something. I'm
a doctor not a god.

920
01:13:44,553 --> 01:13:45,645
But sir
- - Get out.

921
01:14:22,791 --> 01:14:23,951
What's going on?

922
01:14:24,827 --> 01:14:28,422
In what language should I explain
that I don't like this Black guy...

923
01:14:29,498 --> 01:14:31,432
Dad, love isn't based on the
colour of one's skin...

924
01:14:32,468 --> 01:14:35,437
Love? His face inspires fear and
you say you love this animal?

925
01:14:35,737 --> 01:14:37,602
Don't you ever come
near my daughter, ok?

926
01:14:37,806 --> 01:14:38,830
Stop it dad.

927
01:14:39,041 --> 01:14:40,599
I've been hearing you
rant since I was a kid

928
01:14:41,076 --> 01:14:43,909
We're treated badly here
because we're not white

929
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:45,947
And you're doing the same thing

930
01:14:46,482 --> 01:14:48,473
because we're slightly
lighter-skinned than him.

931
01:14:48,584 --> 01:14:49,608
What?

932
01:14:49,751 --> 01:14:50,775
Dad, the problem is in your mind.

933
01:14:50,919 --> 01:14:53,513
You are racist.
You are narrow-minded.

934
01:14:54,156 --> 01:14:55,487
You stupid!

935
01:14:55,958 --> 01:14:58,722
I'm older than you, I'm your father,
do you understand?

936
01:14:58,827 --> 01:15:00,886
You have to stop meeting this
black guy and that's that.

937
01:15:01,029 --> 01:15:02,621
Come on
- Dad let it be.

938
01:15:04,066 --> 01:15:08,469
I'm eighteen and I know
how to live my life.

939
01:15:08,871 --> 01:15:12,466
If I listen to you, I'll
become like you...

940
01:15:14,076 --> 01:15:17,477
What do you me like me?
What do you mean like me?

941
01:15:17,613 --> 01:15:18,705
What's wrong with me?
- I don't know dad.

942
01:15:21,049 --> 01:15:23,643
What's that Indian saying Something
about The washer man's dog...

943
01:15:25,587 --> 01:15:30,024
Oh... Now you're going
to call your dad a dog?

944
01:15:32,194 --> 01:15:35,095
Go ahead. Say it. That's
all that's left to say.

945
01:15:35,631 --> 01:15:37,758
Say it directly, why you
hiding behind a saying...

946
01:15:37,866 --> 01:15:39,857
Hemu, stop it. What are you doing?

947
01:15:40,536 --> 01:15:41,594
What are you doing here?

948
01:15:41,803 --> 01:15:44,499
You guys leave... go...

949
01:15:47,009 --> 01:15:50,035
Go. And don't let me see
your face ever again...

950
01:15:50,546 --> 01:15:51,604
Hemu, please stop it.

951
01:15:51,713 --> 01:15:52,771
She has the nerve
to abuse her father.

952
01:15:52,881 --> 01:15:56,908
Please stop it. Why are
you acting this way?

953
01:15:59,855 --> 01:16:04,519
If you go on like this,
you'll lose everyone...

954
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:09,522
How is it my fault? Yes... I
don't like who I am today.

955
01:16:13,669 --> 01:16:16,536
Hemu, nobody likes who are today.

956
01:16:24,580 --> 01:16:26,571
If your family hasn't talked
to you in two years

957
01:16:27,182 --> 01:16:28,945
it's not because
they've forgotten you

958
01:16:29,685 --> 01:16:32,552
It's because they are
sick of your excuses.

959
01:16:35,190 --> 01:16:36,953
If your friends have
turned against you

960
01:16:38,093 --> 01:16:40,493
it's not because you are
a janitor but because you

961
01:16:40,596 --> 01:16:43,656
made them feel small in order
to hide your own irrelevance.

962
01:16:46,702 --> 01:16:49,569
Your daughter isn't upset that
you have a problem with Silver.

963
01:16:50,739 --> 01:16:54,106
She's upset that you have a problem
with the colour of his skin.

964
01:16:56,678 --> 01:16:57,702
You mother didn't send
you here to get gifts

965
01:16:57,813 --> 01:16:58,837
like the neighbours.

966
01:17:00,015 --> 01:17:02,575
You came here to make a
better life for yourself.

967
01:17:05,621 --> 01:17:07,816
The problem isn't that you
cheer for the Indian team

968
01:17:08,991 --> 01:17:11,516
but that you are even willing
to wear the flag of the U.K.

969
01:17:11,627 --> 01:17:13,117
to prove a point.

970
01:17:14,763 --> 01:17:19,928
Think about it Hemu, how can
anyone be happy with you?

971
01:17:22,638 --> 01:17:25,732
It's not yourjob that makes you a
small person - it's your attitude

972
01:17:34,916 --> 01:17:37,612
I never thought about
your happiness

973
01:17:39,655 --> 01:17:41,145
Or our child's happiness
Or even my happiness

974
01:17:44,660 --> 01:17:46,753
We could have gone abroad
after we got married

975
01:17:46,995 --> 01:17:48,656
We could have had
a comfortable life

976
01:17:49,164 --> 01:17:50,188
I said no

977
01:17:51,667 --> 01:17:52,725
I want to stay here...

978
01:17:54,703 --> 01:17:57,638
This is my country,
these are my people

979
01:17:58,006 --> 01:17:59,667
I have a certain responsibility
towards them

980
01:18:02,911 --> 01:18:07,177
So I took on this job
in a state-run hospital

981
01:18:08,684 --> 01:18:11,983
All I thought about were
patients, patients,

982
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:13,678
and more patients...

983
01:18:18,927 --> 01:18:20,918
I fell asleep thinking about them...

984
01:18:21,029 --> 01:18:23,020
I woke up thinking about them

985
01:18:24,966 --> 01:18:28,993
And yet, they wanted to avoid me...
they were afraid of me

986
01:18:30,072 --> 01:18:31,937
They made fun of me when
my back was turned

987
01:18:33,809 --> 01:18:36,039
And today, some stranger
shows up at the hospital

988
01:18:36,278 --> 01:18:37,711
Someone who is neither a
relative nor a friend...

989
01:18:38,714 --> 01:18:40,841
And yet, they are willing to
give their lives for him.

990
01:18:43,852 --> 01:18:45,945
And they keep making fun of me...

991
01:18:47,723 --> 01:18:48,815
Because I'm harsh.

992
01:18:53,895 --> 01:18:54,953
What did I do wrong?

993
01:18:55,063 --> 01:18:56,087
"Where I went wrong?"

994
01:19:08,744 --> 01:19:10,871
The answer is within you Satya

995
01:19:14,116 --> 01:19:18,712
Each individual wants a little
happiness out of life Satya...

996
01:19:21,757 --> 01:19:24,783
The day you start to breathe a
little happiness into their lives

997
01:19:26,828 --> 01:19:28,728
Nobody will avoid you any more...

998
01:19:59,194 --> 01:20:00,218
Morning

999
01:20:14,109 --> 01:20:15,133
Sir...

1000
01:20:15,243 --> 01:20:16,267
Sir...

1001
01:20:16,411 --> 01:20:19,778
Sir...
- Yes.

1002
01:20:22,818 --> 01:20:26,811
Sir the waiting list is very
long but we've found a donor

1003
01:20:26,955 --> 01:20:29,321
And the blood type and
HLA factors match...

1004
01:20:29,825 --> 01:20:32,293
Oh that's nice. That was quick.

1005
01:20:32,394 --> 01:20:33,418
Who is it?

1006
01:21:01,857 --> 01:21:06,351
Sir, my dad is in a coma.
He's brain dead...

1007
01:21:06,895 --> 01:21:09,022
He's breathing but you
know how it is...

1008
01:21:09,865 --> 01:21:14,461
But if his kidney can be used by
David, it could save his life.

1009
01:21:14,903 --> 01:21:18,839
Mum and I have decided to
give his kidney to David.

1010
01:21:19,507 --> 01:21:20,872
If I cross paths with him
from time to time...

1011
01:21:20,976 --> 01:21:22,409
I'll feel like I'm meeting
my father...

1012
01:21:31,019 --> 01:21:32,850
We have to operate asap.

1013
01:21:34,222 --> 01:21:35,849
Congratulations.

1014
01:21:36,157 --> 01:21:37,181
Congratulations Sir.

1015
01:21:37,292 --> 01:21:38,316
Congratulations David.

1016
01:21:38,426 --> 01:21:39,859
What's up? Sattu's
been transferred?

1017
01:21:40,028 --> 01:21:41,052
No no.

1018
01:21:43,231 --> 01:21:44,892
I'll have you transferred
out of here... back home.

1019
01:21:45,901 --> 01:21:50,099
What are you doing here? You've
never asked for my autograph.

1020
01:21:50,205 --> 01:21:51,229
Come back later.

1021
01:21:53,241 --> 01:21:54,936
We need to operate on the 26th.

1022
01:21:55,176 --> 01:21:56,200
The 26th of April?

1023
01:21:56,912 --> 01:21:58,903
If it was 26th May it wouldn't
be an emergency!

1024
01:21:59,014 --> 01:22:00,914
Don't worry about the date,
each day matters...

1025
01:22:01,917 --> 01:22:03,111
But the 26th is a problem dude.

1026
01:22:05,353 --> 01:22:08,151
We're scheduling it for the
26th to solve your problem.

1027
01:22:08,924 --> 01:22:11,893
The final is on the 28th.
Operate after that.

1028
01:22:11,993 --> 01:22:13,017
You don't have that much time.

1029
01:22:13,194 --> 01:22:16,891
Kidneys don't wear watches.
If we delay you'll be dead.

1030
01:22:17,265 --> 01:22:18,994
It's the 26th. Confirmed.

1031
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:20,326
No, we'll do it after the 28th.

1032
01:22:23,405 --> 01:22:24,895
I said the 26th it is.

1033
01:22:25,006 --> 01:22:26,940
I don't want to hear another word.
It will be post the 28th

1034
01:22:33,214 --> 01:22:34,238
Is that a new injection?

1035
01:22:36,952 --> 01:22:38,010
Relax... relax...

1036
01:22:39,020 --> 01:22:40,851
Son, you've got to take care
of your wife as if you've got

1037
01:22:40,956 --> 01:22:42,014
the Moon and the stars in your home.

1038
01:22:42,123 --> 01:22:44,182
I want her to be like the moon
and the stars... far away.

1039
01:22:45,427 --> 01:22:46,917
You've become as tall
as a sugarcane reed

1040
01:22:47,062 --> 01:22:48,120
But your brain weighs less
than a cube of sugar.

1041
01:22:48,530 --> 01:22:49,929
Fine, make fun of me...

1042
01:22:50,565 --> 01:22:52,931
Go and tell your friends
that your son is a dummy.

1043
01:22:53,301 --> 01:22:54,325
What else should I call you?

1044
01:22:54,436 --> 01:22:55,528
You couldn't even take
care of your wife.

1045
01:22:55,637 --> 01:22:57,195
The name should match
the behaviour: Dummy.

1046
01:22:57,405 --> 01:22:59,498
Ok, enough dad.
I don't want to argue

1047
01:23:00,241 --> 01:23:02,937
I've decided. I want a divorce...
I'm sure.

1048
01:23:05,180 --> 01:23:08,013
Are you my son or a judge...
reading out decrees

1049
01:23:08,984 --> 01:23:10,315
It is decided I must
leave the college.

1050
01:23:10,418 --> 01:23:12,113
It is decided I must
become an actor.

1051
01:23:12,287 --> 01:23:13,948
It is decided I will marry.

1052
01:23:14,122 --> 01:23:15,180
It is decided I will get a divorce.

1053
01:23:15,991 --> 01:23:17,015
Next, if I tell you a thing or two

1054
01:23:17,125 --> 01:23:18,956
you'll be ready to walk out on me.

1055
01:23:19,060 --> 01:23:20,084
Daddy...

1056
01:23:20,195 --> 01:23:21,219
What do you mean daddy...

1057
01:23:21,997 --> 01:23:24,158
You just don't care
about relationships.

1058
01:23:24,265 --> 01:23:26,062
Whether it's us or your wife...

1059
01:23:27,202 --> 01:23:32,970
Look son... Kashmira loves
you and you don't see it.

1060
01:23:33,274 --> 01:23:34,332
You're off to become an actor

1061
01:23:35,010 --> 01:23:37,979
but first be a star in your
own home... like your dad

1062
01:23:38,079 --> 01:23:39,171
Star? Him?

1063
01:23:40,482 --> 01:23:44,282
Why not? Only those who do
"big" things are stars?

1064
01:23:44,419 --> 01:23:48,617
Those who are considerate
about small things aren't?

1065
01:23:49,024 --> 01:23:51,185
Have you ever considered
your wife's happiness?

1066
01:23:53,161 --> 01:23:54,287
Your father has.

1067
01:23:56,131 --> 01:23:57,996
Have you ever really
listened to her?

1068
01:24:00,035 --> 01:24:01,093
Your father has.

1069
01:24:02,003 --> 01:24:03,368
We used to fight a lot too...

1070
01:24:04,105 --> 01:24:07,006
But your dad has never
threatened to leave me.

1071
01:24:08,309 --> 01:24:12,405
Fine... he may not be the
smartest man in the world

1072
01:24:13,048 --> 01:24:18,008
But he's an amazing
husband... Really.

1073
01:24:20,655 --> 01:24:21,679
Did you hear that dummy?

1074
01:24:23,091 --> 01:24:25,025
Be a man, not a pain in the ass.

1075
01:24:25,660 --> 01:24:28,220
Marriage isn't a cricket match
where you simply change the wickets.

1076
01:24:29,064 --> 01:24:30,292
You won the girl over...

1077
01:24:30,398 --> 01:24:31,422
Now show us if you can
win your wife over...

1078
01:24:32,067 --> 01:24:34,365
Then, even if Dhoni
scores a century...

1079
01:24:34,469 --> 01:24:35,493
He'll be a zero compared to you...

1080
01:24:44,079 --> 01:24:45,137
David.

1081
01:24:47,182 --> 01:24:48,206
David.

1082
01:24:50,118 --> 01:24:51,176
How are you David?

1083
01:24:51,352 --> 01:24:53,684
We're all missing you

1084
01:24:54,155 --> 01:24:56,089
Get well soon and come back
to the cricket ground...

1085
01:24:56,191 --> 01:24:58,056
Yes... who is it?

1086
01:24:58,359 --> 01:25:01,089
How does it feel to meet your team

1087
01:25:02,230 --> 01:25:05,495
Hey, it's you guys... Come here...

1088
01:25:09,437 --> 01:25:11,098
You're practicing right?

1089
01:25:11,206 --> 01:25:12,230
Yes, we are...

1090
01:25:12,740 --> 01:25:15,208
They're really good, these kids.

1091
01:25:15,743 --> 01:25:22,273
You're pretty good too... nice
try Sattu, but unsuccessful.

1092
01:25:25,153 --> 01:25:29,089
The surgery will take place only
after the final... right?

1093
01:25:29,190 --> 01:25:30,214
Yes...

1094
01:25:40,135 --> 01:25:41,193
Hemu

1095
01:25:41,302 --> 01:25:42,326
Thank God you came to work today...

1096
01:25:42,770 --> 01:25:44,670
They were going to replace you.

1097
01:25:46,207 --> 01:25:49,540
After 10 years they would fire
me for a 10-day absence?

1098
01:25:49,644 --> 01:25:50,235
Who do they think they are?

1099
01:27:04,285 --> 01:27:09,723
There's a commentator, I had
performed a surgery on him

1100
01:27:16,431 --> 01:27:18,228
His name is Dogle...

1101
01:27:18,366 --> 01:27:21,199
Not Dogle sir, Bhogle...
Mr. Harsha Bhogle

1102
01:27:21,402 --> 01:27:23,597
Find his number... call him...
I want to talk to him.

1103
01:27:23,705 --> 01:27:25,502
But sir...
- Yes...

1104
01:27:26,374 --> 01:27:27,398
Yes, sir.

1105
01:27:29,244 --> 01:27:32,213
No problem doctor, just
tell me what you need.

1106
01:27:33,448 --> 01:27:34,540
Anything for our Chinaman

1107
01:27:34,749 --> 01:27:36,512
Thank you, thank you very much...

1108
01:27:36,651 --> 01:27:39,313
Doctor, it seems you're
a cricket fan too...

1109
01:27:39,420 --> 01:27:40,444
Talk softly...

1110
01:27:40,555 --> 01:27:43,217
If someone hears you they'll
give you a rabies shot

1111
01:27:59,274 --> 01:28:06,442
The surgery will be after
the final... happy now?

1112
01:28:06,881 --> 01:28:10,578
I'm happy, but I'm really
impressed with you

1113
01:28:11,286 --> 01:28:13,447
After all the resistance, you
finally joined our team.

1114
01:29:04,339 --> 01:29:07,331
Sir, what exactly do you want to do?

1115
01:29:07,608 --> 01:29:10,441
David wants to watch a match,
so he'll watch a match...

1116
01:29:10,678 --> 01:29:11,702
A fake match?

1117
01:29:12,347 --> 01:29:14,338
A real match, but in our style.

1118
01:29:14,882 --> 01:29:17,316
But David will figure
it out right away...

1119
01:29:17,785 --> 01:29:20,253
Forget that, tell me what
the symptoms are of the

1120
01:29:20,355 --> 01:29:21,652
final stage of kidney failure?

1121
01:29:22,390 --> 01:29:25,325
Nausea, vomiting, skin pigmentation,
easy bleeding

1122
01:29:25,493 --> 01:29:29,896
And? You're forgetting
an important symptom

1123
01:29:29,997 --> 01:29:33,330
Delirium, confusion,
anterograde amnesia.

1124
01:29:34,902 --> 01:29:38,338
Your mind gets weaker, you're
always confused...

1125
01:30:24,585 --> 01:30:26,416
Good morning, FedEx. May I help you?

1126
01:30:26,554 --> 01:30:30,957
Hi, this is Harsha Bhogle. I have
a parcel to be sent to Mumbai.

1127
01:30:31,426 --> 01:30:33,451
It's very urgent. It has
to get there tomorrow...

1128
01:30:33,995 --> 01:30:36,555
Tomorrow seems difficult sir,
but we'll try our best.

1129
01:30:36,697 --> 01:30:38,528
I'd really appreciate
it if you could...

1130
01:30:38,766 --> 01:30:40,461
We'll have your parcel
picked up sir...

1131
01:31:11,466 --> 01:31:12,524
Good morning.

1132
01:31:12,633 --> 01:31:13,657
Morning Sir.

1133
01:31:13,801 --> 01:31:15,462
We haven't chatted with
you in three days...

1134
01:31:15,570 --> 01:31:16,559
We missed it.

1135
01:31:16,671 --> 01:31:17,695
Three days?

1136
01:31:17,805 --> 01:31:19,432
Yes of course... If you
had slept another day,

1137
01:31:19,574 --> 01:31:21,474
You would have had to watch
the highlights of the final.

1138
01:31:21,809 --> 01:31:23,436
You mean today is the final?

1139
01:31:23,611 --> 01:31:26,444
Yes, it's today. And we're all set.

1140
01:31:27,682 --> 01:31:30,446
Look Sir, India's in the finals...

1141
01:31:30,585 --> 01:31:32,450
Hey you've got the blue uniform...

1142
01:31:32,653 --> 01:31:34,450
Organize one for me too brother...

1143
01:31:35,490 --> 01:31:36,548
And you've got the newspaper...

1144
01:31:36,757 --> 01:31:37,781
Let's see who all are playing

1145
01:31:37,892 --> 01:31:38,916
It's an India-England final sir

1146
01:32:05,119 --> 01:32:07,679
The match doesn't seem ok...
something's wrong

1147
01:32:09,524 --> 01:32:10,582
Nothing's wrong

1148
01:32:12,527 --> 01:32:14,688
It's come too easy
so it's not valued.

1149
01:32:14,795 --> 01:32:16,490
I'm talking about this place.

1150
01:32:16,864 --> 01:32:20,493
India's losing but nobody
here looks tense...

1151
01:32:21,102 --> 01:32:22,933
Tense? We're really upset...

1152
01:32:23,538 --> 01:32:25,870
I'm so upset I've drenched three
tissues and eaten one.

1153
01:32:35,683 --> 01:32:37,446
Hey the day that Sachin
scored a century

1154
01:32:37,552 --> 01:32:38,780
you two had held hands right?

1155
01:32:38,886 --> 01:32:40,513
No sir, that was-

1156
01:32:40,621 --> 01:32:42,555
Hold hands...

1157
01:33:46,621 --> 01:33:49,146
Oh God this guy's stuck on the
field... he's not getting out...

1158
01:33:49,790 --> 01:33:50,916
Sanction one more thing Sattu

1159
01:33:51,025 --> 01:33:52,049
Tell me... what?

1160
01:33:52,627 --> 01:33:55,528
Tell Ganesh to stand on
that chair on one leg

1161
01:33:55,630 --> 01:33:56,722
so that he gets out.

1162
01:33:58,199 --> 01:34:00,861
Ok, Ganesh, come on
pick up one leg.

1163
01:34:00,968 --> 01:34:01,992
What sir?

1164
01:34:02,269 --> 01:34:04,601
Stand on the chair on one leg.

1165
01:34:04,772 --> 01:34:05,796
Here?

1166
01:34:05,906 --> 01:34:07,601
Do what he says...

1167
01:34:18,019 --> 01:34:19,043
Hi

1168
01:34:19,153 --> 01:34:21,621
Hi... Hi Kashmira
- Hi.

1169
01:34:22,657 --> 01:34:23,715
How was the day?

1170
01:34:23,824 --> 01:34:26,622
Amazing day! I took some
fabulous pictures.

1171
01:34:26,727 --> 01:34:27,751
Really?

1172
01:34:27,862 --> 01:34:29,625
Ya, I can't wait to develop
those pictures...

1173
01:34:29,730 --> 01:34:30,754
Oh lovely.

1174
01:34:30,865 --> 01:34:32,730
You're coming right?
- Of course I'm coming...

1175
01:34:32,833 --> 01:34:33,891
Go ahead and change
and I'll join you.

1176
01:34:34,001 --> 01:34:36,162
Ok. Back in a minute, Ok?

1177
01:34:40,675 --> 01:34:42,575
That's what's really
nice about you two...

1178
01:34:42,677 --> 01:34:43,939
You have common interests

1179
01:34:45,346 --> 01:34:46,677
Honestly speaking Kash...

1180
01:34:47,715 --> 01:34:49,649
I'm not at all interested
in photography.

1181
01:34:50,685 --> 01:34:52,744
So... then how come...

1182
01:34:53,220 --> 01:34:55,245
He can develop the photographs
by himself.

1183
01:34:55,990 --> 01:35:00,654
But if I'm with him he feels
that I'm sharing his joy

1184
01:35:01,696 --> 01:35:04,597
By spending an hour in the
dark room with him I get

1185
01:35:04,699 --> 01:35:08,226
his attention and affection
for the remaining 23.

1186
01:35:46,841 --> 01:35:47,865
Hello?

1187
01:35:48,042 --> 01:35:49,066
Hi.

1188
01:35:53,080 --> 01:35:54,104
Hi.

1189
01:35:54,749 --> 01:35:57,718
I was thinking... if you're free...

1190
01:35:57,818 --> 01:35:58,842
Maybe we could go out
for dinner tonight?

1191
01:36:01,856 --> 01:36:04,654
Tonight isn't possible...
We have to organize a party

1192
01:36:04,759 --> 01:36:07,250
for Vidhi's wedding.

1193
01:36:07,795 --> 01:36:08,819
Only girls, no boys?

1194
01:36:09,764 --> 01:36:10,856
Only one boy.

1195
01:36:10,965 --> 01:36:11,989
Who?

1196
01:36:12,099 --> 01:36:14,727
A male stripper. We still
need to organize that...

1197
01:36:14,869 --> 01:36:17,736
A male stripper! What's
wrong with you girls?

1198
01:36:17,905 --> 01:36:18,963
You're going to start
stripping boys now?

1199
01:36:19,073 --> 01:36:22,099
Oh come on Saby. Now don't
say you have a problem

1200
01:36:22,209 --> 01:36:24,370
with this too... You had a
bachelor party, didn't you?

1201
01:36:24,779 --> 01:36:25,837
Yes.

1202
01:36:26,046 --> 01:36:27,775
So? Guys can do what they want

1203
01:36:27,882 --> 01:36:29,873
only girls shouldn't have any fun!

1204
01:36:31,919 --> 01:36:34,752
Ok, if your party happens
to get cancelled...

1205
01:36:35,322 --> 01:36:36,346
Let's catch up

1206
01:36:37,391 --> 01:36:41,088
The party's on... whether we
find a male stripper or not

1207
01:36:42,830 --> 01:36:46,197
And anyway, isn't your cricket
final on tonight?

1208
01:36:47,134 --> 01:36:49,125
Wouldn't that interest
you more than dinner?

1209
01:36:49,804 --> 01:36:51,795
Hmm, that's true.

1210
01:37:47,027 --> 01:37:49,825
I've been watching you...
your bank papers,

1211
01:37:49,997 --> 01:37:53,262
your work papers... your
records are clean.

1212
01:37:58,138 --> 01:37:59,833
You've passed every test.

1213
01:38:00,941 --> 01:38:02,772
I couldn't find anything to
prove that you do not deserve

1214
01:38:02,877 --> 01:38:04,845
to be a citizen of this country

1215
01:38:06,347 --> 01:38:09,510
So it's yours... take it.

1216
01:38:16,891 --> 01:38:19,860
Now I get it, when it no
longer means anything...

1217
01:38:20,027 --> 01:38:21,051
I beg your pardon...

1218
01:38:22,897 --> 01:38:23,955
No sir... nothing.

1219
01:38:24,899 --> 01:38:28,130
Anyway, congratulations.
You are British now.

1220
01:39:44,979 --> 01:39:46,037
It's a stripper!!

1221
01:41:07,327 --> 01:41:08,351
Who told you?

1222
01:41:09,063 --> 01:41:10,121
Mr. Cook.

1223
01:41:21,075 --> 01:41:23,475
This sari... is for
your mom, from me...

1224
01:41:30,084 --> 01:41:31,210
And this suit is for your brother.

1225
01:41:31,351 --> 01:41:33,182
Who knows when we'll
get to go to India...

1226
01:41:36,557 --> 01:41:37,581
All the best!

1227
01:41:43,163 --> 01:41:44,187
Cheers man.

1228
01:41:49,203 --> 01:41:54,072
Really... I feel small
compared to them...

1229
01:41:57,111 --> 01:42:02,344
I don't know whether to
laugh or cry. Thank you

1230
01:42:09,690 --> 01:42:17,096
Yes... yes Mom... I'm coming...

1231
01:42:19,133 --> 01:42:23,092
What Jignesh? Thank you.

1232
01:42:24,538 --> 01:42:28,531
I'm coming. Thanks.

1233
01:42:40,154 --> 01:42:41,280
Hey Dad... Congrats.

1234
01:42:45,192 --> 01:42:48,059
I'm so happy today...
I need something black-

1235
01:42:48,162 --> 01:42:50,221
Black keeps the evil eye away.

1236
01:42:51,765 --> 01:42:54,131
Your blackie is standing
outside... and you -

1237
01:42:54,301 --> 01:42:55,325
Dad.

1238
01:43:00,174 --> 01:43:02,142
I missed the point all along-

1239
01:43:02,242 --> 01:43:05,678
If you put a Hindu priest in a
church, he'll still pray to Ram

1240
01:43:08,782 --> 01:43:13,719
I was so desperate to
change my circumstances

1241
01:43:14,188 --> 01:43:16,179
that I had started
to change myself...

1242
01:43:18,292 --> 01:43:19,316
Sorry Priya.

1243
01:43:20,194 --> 01:43:21,252
It's ok.

1244
01:43:37,811 --> 01:43:41,406
Are you crazy? You're going to
strip in front of so many women?

1245
01:43:42,549 --> 01:43:43,607
You're going to dance like that?

1246
01:43:44,585 --> 01:43:46,177
I don't like all this...

1247
01:43:48,222 --> 01:43:50,213
I don't like it if someone
else thinks of you...

1248
01:43:51,658 --> 01:43:53,421
You don't like it if someone
else touches me...

1249
01:43:55,229 --> 01:43:57,220
If this isn't love,
then what is baby?

1250
01:44:02,569 --> 01:44:06,198
In any case I'm doing
all this for you...

1251
01:44:10,344 --> 01:44:13,643
If you had done this earlier...

1252
01:44:16,250 --> 01:44:17,342
Sachin and Dhoni would be nobodies...

1253
01:44:20,787 --> 01:44:26,225
I promise... from now on
you're my first priority

1254
01:44:28,695 --> 01:44:30,788
Promise
- 100%

1255
01:44:32,299 --> 01:44:33,323
Ok.

1256
01:44:35,736 --> 01:44:37,226
I promise that after today...

1257
01:44:38,272 --> 01:44:42,265
I won't stop you from watching
cricket either...

1258
01:44:42,409 --> 01:44:44,240
You sure? 100%...

1259
01:44:44,511 --> 01:44:46,172
There's still half an hour
left in the match...

1260
01:44:46,280 --> 01:44:47,338
can we go watch it... please?

1261
01:44:47,547 --> 01:44:49,640
Please, please... You have no idea
how hard to control myself...

1262
01:44:55,355 --> 01:44:56,379
What?

1263
01:44:56,490 --> 01:44:57,514
At least get dressed...

1264
01:45:10,671 --> 01:45:12,332
Hey Chinaman

1265
01:45:19,313 --> 01:45:22,874
I harassed you so much and
you still saved my life...

1266
01:45:23,383 --> 01:45:26,216
You're an excellent doctor...
but when it comes to

1267
01:45:26,320 --> 01:45:30,279
Match-fixing, you're
an absolute zero!

1268
01:45:30,457 --> 01:45:31,481
What do you mean?

1269
01:45:31,892 --> 01:45:34,452
Harsha and Wilkins were not
in this World Cup at all...

1270
01:45:35,329 --> 01:45:37,320
Did they win a quiz show
and pop up in the finals?

1271
01:45:40,434 --> 01:45:41,526
You got caught didn't you?

1272
01:45:42,803 --> 01:45:44,896
If you knew why did we
put on the whole show?

1273
01:45:45,339 --> 01:45:47,330
You wanted to fix my kidney

1274
01:45:47,774 --> 01:45:49,469
and I wanted to fix
a smile on your face.

1275
01:45:50,344 --> 01:45:51,402
Both got done.

1276
01:45:54,481 --> 01:45:55,505
Now I'll watch the finals.

1277
01:45:57,351 --> 01:45:58,409
The real ones...

1278
01:45:58,618 --> 01:45:59,642
Yeah, the real ones...
